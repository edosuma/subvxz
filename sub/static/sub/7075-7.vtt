WEBVTT

00:05.223 --> 00:06.608
You're ready for the bus driver, Winger?

00:06.915 --> 00:08.557
You know why they call me bus driver, right?

00:08.558 --> 00:09.932
Because you been
travelin' all day?

00:09.933 --> 00:11.599
Because I'm taking
your butt to school.

00:14.565 --> 00:15.404
Nice.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.161
Cool, I'm up.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.911
Nuh-uh. Game's to 15.

00:18.912 --> 00:20.552
- Since when?
- Since you scored 11.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.505
Sorry, Abed, I have to
finish kicking Troy's butt

00:22.506 --> 00:23.513
before I can get to yours.

00:23.514 --> 00:25.328
See? All that angry
talk about butts.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.061
"Kick your butt. Stomp your butt.

00:27.062 --> 00:27.836
Punch your butt."

00:27.837 --> 00:29.173
Do they say, "punch your butt"?

00:29.174 --> 00:31.612
Point being hatred of
each other's butts.

00:31.613 --> 00:34.028
Men play sports so they
can seek out and destroy

00:34.029 --> 00:35.377
their own sensitivity.

00:35.378 --> 00:37.487
Oh! I never thought
about it that way.

00:37.488 --> 00:38.996
Do you think we'll learn
about stuff like that

00:38.997 --> 00:40.376
in our women's studies class?

00:40.377 --> 00:41.212
Hell, no!

00:41.213 --> 00:42.870
We're gonna find our
roots in that class.

00:42.871 --> 00:45.275
And stop defining our
gender by theirs.

00:45.276 --> 00:46.199
Well, I feel bad saying it,

00:46.200 --> 00:47.634
but it will be nice to
get away from the boys

00:47.635 --> 00:49.322
and take a class with just us.

00:49.323 --> 00:52.870
Amen. Or "a-wo-men."

00:53.164 --> 00:54.133
Am I right?

00:54.134 --> 00:55.851
Bring it in for a
boob bump, ladies.

00:55.852 --> 00:58.035
Uh...
Nope?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.311
We'll get there.

00:59.706 --> 01:00.924
Hey, guys.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.158
Remember last week when you were

01:02.159 --> 01:03.875
playing with those
remote control cars

01:03.876 --> 01:05.453
and you thought you
were real cool?

01:05.455 --> 01:06.802
Well, turns out you're not.

01:07.929 --> 01:10.236
Draganflyer, bee-otch.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.307
Yep, uh, four propellers.

01:12.308 --> 01:14.406
It's got a built-in spy cam.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.673
100 yards.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.034
And it'll strangle your
stupid cars' little butts.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.835
- Pierce, we're in a game.
- Yeah.

01:21.142 --> 01:22.969
And we're really not
into R.C. anymore.

01:22.970 --> 01:25.501
What? It's... it's a draganflyer.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.703
Come on, Pierce, man.
This is a school.

01:31.704 --> 01:33.157
- I can't control it.
- Watch it.

01:33.158 --> 01:34.436
There's a little pilot in there.

01:34.437 --> 01:35.756
- It's not funny, Pierce!
- Propellers are sharp!

01:35.757 --> 01:36.709
Stop it!

01:39.868 --> 01:41.279
Knuckle walkers!

01:41.406 --> 01:42.640
Ahh.

01:42.719 --> 01:44.072
Sorry, it was an accident.

01:44.073 --> 01:45.494
So was the "y" chromosome,

01:45.495 --> 01:47.607
but you don't see us
throwing stuff at it.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.927
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

01:51.768 --> 01:52.809
Where you guys going?

01:52.810 --> 01:54.783
Away from your
symbolically invasive balls

01:54.784 --> 01:56.567
to a women's studies class.

01:57.674 --> 01:59.066
Which women's studies class?

01:59.076 --> 02:01.343
Feminist
representations in media.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.383
- I'm in.
- Oh, uh, Abed,

02:03.384 --> 02:05.530
we kind of thought this would
be something just for the girls.

02:05.531 --> 02:06.608
Sounds like it.

02:06.609 --> 02:08.130
I'd love to learn more about you.

02:08.131 --> 02:10.127
I'll change out of my sports
clothes and meet you there.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.357
- Uh... 
- We...Um...

02:15.258 --> 02:16.713
* You just lost

02:16.967 --> 02:22.323
you just lost a game you just
lost you just lost a game

02:22.522 --> 02:24.387
with Troy *
- Uhh!

02:27.830 --> 02:29.072
Hey, sore loser.

02:29.343 --> 02:30.632
Yeah...Proud of it.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.883
I want a rematch.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.290 --> 03:29.009
Hey, guys.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.504
I raced here so I could
save us four seats.

03:31.429 --> 03:32.525
Thanks, Abed.

03:32.526 --> 03:35.922
But...Annie can't see the
board from this far back.

03:35.923 --> 03:37.332
She lost her glasses.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.371
I've never seen
you wear glasses.

03:38.372 --> 03:39.659
Yeah, I usually wear contacts,

03:39.660 --> 03:42.256
but I couldn't find them...
Without my glasses.

03:42.288 --> 03:43.700
Which I wear.

03:44.245 --> 03:45.359
Cool-cool-cool.

03:46.248 --> 03:47.293
Are we bad people?

03:47.294 --> 03:48.844
No. I love Abed.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.392
But sometimes he
can't take a hint.

03:50.393 --> 03:52.445
We told him...
this is a girl thing.

03:52.525 --> 03:53.649
Ahem.

03:53.768 --> 03:54.773
'Scuse me.

03:55.075 --> 03:56.114
We were gonna sit there.

03:56.115 --> 03:57.951
Oh, uh, sorry. We didn't know.

03:57.952 --> 04:01.362
But now we're sitting here, so...
That's the problem.

04:01.363 --> 04:03.626
You don't seriously
expect us to get up

04:03.627 --> 04:05.428
and change seats for you?

04:05.429 --> 04:08.542
Well, if you're further in back,
less people will see your roots.

04:08.662 --> 04:10.590
Um...Excuse me?

04:10.591 --> 04:13.173
Oh, the way you excuse
your little moustache hairs?

04:13.174 --> 04:14.971
Uh, you know what?

04:14.972 --> 04:15.843
We're good people.

04:15.844 --> 04:17.846
So we will find seats elsewhere.

04:17.846 --> 04:19.273
It's called the high road.

04:19.274 --> 04:20.974
I hope it leads to a salon.

04:25.631 --> 04:26.402
You're back.

04:26.403 --> 04:28.277
I've seen 'em before.
The leader's name is Meghan.

04:28.278 --> 04:30.187
Of course! Why name
your daughter Meghan?

04:30.188 --> 04:31.941
Are you stocking up
for a bitch shortage?

04:31.942 --> 04:32.781
Which one's Meghan?

04:32.782 --> 04:33.990
The one with the hole
in her sweater's armpit,

04:33.991 --> 04:35.297
or the one whose tight
sleeves are pushing her fat

04:35.298 --> 04:36.686
toward her elbows?

04:37.852 --> 04:39.835
No, those are her cronies.

04:39.836 --> 04:40.830
So Meghan's the one
with the crooked ears

04:40.831 --> 04:43.011
- and no ankles?
- Ha! Damn.

04:43.012 --> 04:44.553
Sorry, I over-described again?

04:44.554 --> 04:45.653
Oh, no, Abed.

04:45.654 --> 04:47.844
Describe those girls all you want.

04:47.845 --> 04:49.626
Yeah. In fact,
what are you doing for lunch?

04:49.627 --> 04:51.481
It's Wednesday.
Sometimes I eat in Jeff's car.

04:51.710 --> 04:52.862
Don't tell him.

04:55.638 --> 04:57.058
Troy, where are you?

04:58.072 --> 05:00.704
You would go this far
to avoid a rematch?

05:05.883 --> 05:06.848
Jeff!

05:07.198 --> 05:08.491
What is this thing?

05:08.746 --> 05:11.939
In my line of work, a
multimillion dollar injury suit.

05:12.664 --> 05:14.642
I thought schools got
rid of these things.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.133
I can't believe
Greendale allows it.

05:17.259 --> 05:18.606
Greendale doesn't.

05:19.116 --> 05:20.484
That's why it's hidden.

05:21.142 --> 05:22.476
Who else saw you come in?

05:22.477 --> 05:23.618
If we say nobody,

05:23.619 --> 05:26.080
are you doing to stab us
with your bush scissors?

05:26.661 --> 05:27.895
Of course not.

05:28.579 --> 05:29.843
I'm Joshua.

05:30.116 --> 05:32.868
And this is a place
of peace and balance.

05:32.869 --> 05:34.368
A place of nourishment.

05:34.718 --> 05:37.002
A place free from darkness.

05:37.106 --> 05:38.732
Because there's a trampoline?

05:38.894 --> 05:42.257
There is something cool
about being up here, Jeff.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.261
I mean, at first I was
just jumping, but then...

05:45.262 --> 05:46.753
But then you started bouncing...

05:47.342 --> 05:49.000
Like a baby on the
knee of a goddess.

05:49.001 --> 05:49.961
Yes!

05:50.176 --> 05:51.202
Yes.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.365
Jeff, get on.

05:53.366 --> 05:55.588
Ah, one at a time, please.

05:55.643 --> 05:58.009
I must as you to adhere
to two simple principles.

05:58.010 --> 06:02.305
First, for this place to
survive, it must stay secret.

06:02.548 --> 06:03.652
And second...

06:04.418 --> 06:06.855
No double bounces.

06:11.451 --> 06:12.849
Feet shoulder width apart.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.578
Knees bent.

06:15.079 --> 06:16.299
And just breathe.

06:16.775 --> 06:19.204
At the apex of each
bounce there is a moment,

06:19.205 --> 06:23.695
outside of time, outside of words...
Outside of everything.

06:24.023 --> 06:27.046
A perfect moment. A silent moment.

06:34.371 --> 06:36.334
I call it the world's whisper.

06:36.551 --> 06:38.869
Wow...You're right.

06:39.834 --> 06:43.154
And I don't mind admitting
you're right, which is weird.

06:44.456 --> 06:47.450
30 seconds on this thing, and
I already feel... Jeff...

06:48.122 --> 06:49.860
You've been up there for an hour.

06:57.641 --> 06:58.486
Yes.

07:03.044 --> 07:05.457
Okay, Abed,
girl in the pink... go.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.362
Her forehead hangs over
her head like a canopy.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.925
She missed a belt loop, and her
stomach spills over her shorts.

07:10.642 --> 07:13.414
- Target destroyed.
- What brutality.

07:13.415 --> 07:15.319
It's called a muffin top, Abed.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.266
Like a muffin? Clever.

07:17.762 --> 07:19.634
But you guys said it's rude
to focus on imperfections.

07:19.635 --> 07:20.927
This the stuff I'm
supposed to filter, right?

07:20.928 --> 07:21.921
Absolutely, Abed.

07:21.922 --> 07:23.353
It's just kind of
a guilty pleasure

07:23.354 --> 07:25.332
to hear it about... certain girls.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.616
Like Meghan and her friends,
because they're bitches.

07:28.575 --> 07:31.202
That's nice.
Uh, who needs a soda?

07:31.203 --> 07:32.305
I'll get it...
I'm making you guys so happy,

07:32.306 --> 07:33.266
I want to keep it going.

07:33.267 --> 07:34.584
Aww...

07:35.753 --> 07:38.228
Okay, I love Abed so much.

07:38.229 --> 07:40.063
I know, it's like
he's one of the girls.

07:40.064 --> 07:41.305
Uh, guys.

07:43.988 --> 07:46.259
Yeah, do you mind
not looking at me?

07:46.260 --> 07:47.810
I don't know, do you
mind that your face makeup

07:47.811 --> 07:49.008
doesn't match your neck?

07:49.009 --> 07:50.791
When I squint,
you look like a circus clown.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.977
Okay, I beg your pardon, geek...

07:56.099 --> 07:58.157
I don't even know your
peanut-headed ass.

07:58.158 --> 07:59.005
You're right, we've never met.

07:59.006 --> 08:00.301
Like your hair and
dandruff shampoo.

08:00.431 --> 08:03.382
Hoo hoo! Filet of Meghan,
service for one.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.267
Okay, Abed,
let's get back to the table.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.932
Yeah, Abed. Go with your skank.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.121
Or keep going. Up to you.

08:11.122 --> 08:13.221
Keep going about what,
her uneven bra padding?

08:13.222 --> 08:15.020
You look like you're smuggling
a lime and a coconut.

08:15.021 --> 08:17.077
- Ooh!
- Go away, loser.

08:17.078 --> 08:18.921
Good one... tell that to the
stitching on your ratty panties,

08:18.922 --> 08:20.464
or wear higher jeans
on laundry day.

08:21.608 --> 08:24.346
Damn, that diss made me snarf, yo!

08:24.391 --> 08:26.083
You know what? You're dead.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.491
You're bowlegged.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.831
Bye. See ya.

08:29.832 --> 08:31.242
Women of Greendale!

08:31.243 --> 08:34.818
This cafeteria has been
declared a bitch-free zone!

08:34.820 --> 08:35.914
Yeah!

08:55.376 --> 08:57.203
Can't tell you how
great I feel right now.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.756
I wasn't sure that you would
take to the trampoline's ways.

08:59.757 --> 09:00.928
Some can't.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.897
And some are just natural jumpers.

09:06.157 --> 09:07.248
See you tomorrow, Joshua.

09:07.786 --> 09:08.997
We better bounce.

09:14.599 --> 09:15.418
Whoa.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.268
That's Sharice.

09:17.269 --> 09:19.261
I had sociology
with her last year.

09:19.262 --> 09:21.553
She told me I walk like a dude.

09:21.554 --> 09:24.104
That's awful! Abed,
you got anything?

09:24.355 --> 09:26.445
I might have something to say
about those jeans she's wearing.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.379
But you guys are
sure it's not bad?

09:28.408 --> 09:30.642
Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.

09:30.643 --> 09:32.169
Yeah, and you're
really good at it.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.343
You're like a machine.

09:33.344 --> 09:36.114
- Like Robocop.
- Exactly like rowboat cop.

09:36.115 --> 09:39.633
Sharice is a bad rowboat.
Sink her.

09:40.553 --> 09:41.643
Affirmative.

09:54.621 --> 09:55.604
They're bad....

09:56.019 --> 09:56.862
bad.

10:05.768 --> 10:09.380
Hey...You dudes ready to shoot
the rock after study group?

10:09.381 --> 10:11.963
I'm gonna slit your
butt's throats.

10:13.868 --> 10:15.433
Nice catch, losers.

10:15.946 --> 10:16.959
Go get it.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.136
Sorry, Pierce.

10:18.179 --> 10:20.035
We're not really into
basketball anymore.

10:20.096 --> 10:21.075
What?

10:21.295 --> 10:22.717
What's up with you guys?

10:23.274 --> 10:24.655
Why are you acting like that?

10:24.656 --> 10:25.642
Like what?

10:26.746 --> 10:28.527
Ah! Gay boots!

10:28.528 --> 10:29.502
Lady boots!

10:30.121 --> 10:31.425
He's a gaywad.

10:32.121 --> 10:33.941
Are those as
comfortable as they look?

10:34.122 --> 10:36.216
They're like wearing
a pair of dreams.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.146
I'm sure your shoes
are fine, though.

10:40.494 --> 10:41.598
You know what?

10:42.037 --> 10:43.099
They are.

10:43.252 --> 10:45.778
Something's up with you two,
and I want to know what it is.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.273
Are you on weed?

10:47.802 --> 10:49.689
Give me some... I'll smoke
you two under the table.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.753
Oh, man, I feel so good.

10:51.754 --> 10:53.541
It's like the whole
campus is a gutter

10:53.542 --> 10:55.235
and we're just spraying it clean.

10:55.236 --> 10:56.914
Abed, I may need you to
come to the bank with me

10:56.915 --> 10:59.624
to have words with a certain
something at window four.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.755
We'll take 'em down.

11:00.756 --> 11:02.331
We'll take all these bitches down.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.059
Ladies, are you okay?

11:04.550 --> 11:05.595
Take it easy.

11:05.596 --> 11:08.536
Um, did you just
tell us what to do?

11:08.537 --> 11:09.593
Here's the thing.

11:09.594 --> 11:10.329
It's a little rule.

11:10.330 --> 11:11.596
Maybe you're not familiar with it.

11:11.597 --> 11:13.631
Nobody tells me what to do... ever.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.172
Whoa, whoa, cowboy. I surrender.

11:16.173 --> 11:17.417
Abed, did you hear that?

11:17.418 --> 11:18.838
- Jeff a bitch too?
- Yes.

11:18.839 --> 11:19.972
- Take him down.
- Cool.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.534
Hey, Jeff, what's with the boots?

11:21.535 --> 11:23.341
2008 called to tell you that,
even in 2008,

11:23.342 --> 11:25.747
those were tacky.
Oh, you go, girl!

11:25.748 --> 11:27.754
Daaamn.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.323
Hey, you guys,
why don't we just all

11:30.324 --> 11:33.702
take a deep breath and...
Find some center.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.621
Okay, that is it!

11:35.722 --> 11:37.014
What are you hiding from me?

11:37.015 --> 11:38.806
They're keeping
relaxation secrets.

11:38.807 --> 11:41.797
Tell me how to get this laid back,
or I'll kill your families!

11:41.798 --> 11:43.640
Okay, this place is lame.

11:43.641 --> 11:44.861
Girls, Abed.

11:44.862 --> 11:45.962
Toodles.

11:48.548 --> 11:49.839
I'm watching you two.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.102
24, 2010.

11:54.070 --> 11:56.529
These balls on your butts.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.277
Quick bounce before lunch?

12:01.278 --> 12:02.326
Absolutely.

12:02.327 --> 12:04.662
Let me just make sure that
Pierce isn't hovering around.

12:08.415 --> 12:09.575
Coast is clear.

12:41.905 --> 12:43.675
What did you see, my pretty?

12:45.151 --> 12:45.998
Wait.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.459
Back, back... freeze it.

12:48.251 --> 12:50.643
Can you blow that up
a little? Enhance.

12:51.039 --> 12:52.070
Enhance.

12:52.985 --> 12:54.399
Enhance.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.053
Stop! That's it.

12:56.745 --> 12:57.826
Blow it up.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.514
There it is.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.166
Um, excuse me, girls.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.671
You're sitting in our seats.

13:06.672 --> 13:08.452
I'm sorry. What did you say?

13:08.453 --> 13:10.394
Oh! I didn't know you were deaf.

13:10.395 --> 13:13.123
I suspected you were
blind from the outfit.

13:15.777 --> 13:16.681
Toodles.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.073
See ya.

13:21.359 --> 13:22.297
Wait a minute.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.049
Why were you mean to them?
Did they insult you?

13:24.050 --> 13:26.787
No, but that top
insulted our retinas.

13:27.603 --> 13:29.182
Go, girl.

13:30.362 --> 13:33.236
Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.

13:38.090 --> 13:39.999
Annie, when you laugh like that,
you snort like a piglet.

13:40.676 --> 13:43.119
- Careful, Abed.
- Be careful with your skin.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.106
Your face is so puffy right now,

13:44.107 --> 13:45.446
your eyes look like
sewn-on buttons.

13:45.447 --> 13:47.427
You need to check that
attitude at the door, Abed.

13:47.428 --> 13:49.072
You need to check the door before
you go through it, Shirley.

13:49.073 --> 13:50.393
What? What?

13:50.394 --> 13:53.283
Abed, you cannot
talk to us that way.

13:53.284 --> 13:55.295
Someone has to.
You guys are being bitches.

13:55.971 --> 13:57.377
We're not bitches!

13:57.378 --> 13:58.586
We were just joking.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.725
If that makes us bitches,
we're all bitches.

14:00.726 --> 14:02.779
- Mm-hmm. 
- That's a good point, Annie.

14:02.780 --> 14:03.730
You told him.

14:03.731 --> 14:05.455
Affirmative. You're all bitches.

14:05.568 --> 14:07.317
Nice shirt. It would
look better on a girl.

14:08.190 --> 14:09.119
Pick a bronzer.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.731
You're not fooling us with that
band-aid... we knew it's a zit.

14:10.732 --> 14:12.228
You're all bitches.
Triple bitches.

14:12.229 --> 14:13.402
- Ohh!
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

14:13.403 --> 14:14.883
Hey, bitch. Bitch. You bitch.

14:14.884 --> 14:16.201
I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.

14:24.024 --> 14:25.056
Pierce!

14:25.520 --> 14:26.619
Ha ha!

14:27.798 --> 14:29.103
How did you find us?

14:29.104 --> 14:30.669
Draganflyer, bee-otch.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.328
So this is the big secret, huh?

14:32.329 --> 14:35.625
You two sneak out here and hang
out on the big, gay trampoline.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.199
Lower your voice, Pierce.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.115
This is our place of peace.

14:39.116 --> 14:41.913
Yes. And now it's mine too.

14:43.708 --> 14:44.607
Mine.

14:49.913 --> 14:51.376
Oh, this is great!

14:52.536 --> 14:53.864
I wanna go higher!

14:55.844 --> 14:58.514
Pierce...Please...
You're doing it all wrong.

14:58.515 --> 14:59.755
I wanna go higher!

14:59.841 --> 15:01.665
Troy, get up here and
double bounce me.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.412
That's not how
we do things here.

15:03.413 --> 15:05.142
You get up here and
double bounce me,

15:05.143 --> 15:07.138
or I'll tell everybody
about this place!

15:07.338 --> 15:08.315
Come on!

15:10.124 --> 15:12.262
God is my witness,
I will tweet it!

15:17.493 --> 15:18.601
Double bounce me!

15:18.602 --> 15:20.648
Why are you doing this?

15:21.067 --> 15:22.468
Double bounce me! Do it!

15:22.469 --> 15:24.084
Pierce, that's enough.

15:24.085 --> 15:25.465
I hate you.

15:26.036 --> 15:27.567
I hate you!

15:27.568 --> 15:29.275
Double bounce me!

15:30.307 --> 15:31.372
Aah!

15:31.613 --> 15:33.165
Father...

15:37.092 --> 15:38.725
My legs! Ohh!

15:38.802 --> 15:42.559
Oh, my legs, I... illegal trampoline!

15:42.560 --> 15:45.024
They have an illegal
trampoline back there!

15:49.640 --> 15:51.775
Whoa, black jeans? Nice try,
Michael Penn.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.386
Those bangs aren't covering
anything, five-head.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.689
Pegged jeans.
Sweater balls. Crows feet.

15:55.690 --> 15:56.618
What's it called
when your back hair

15:56.619 --> 15:58.118
grows into your neck hair
grows into your regular hair?

15:58.119 --> 15:59.457
Look it up, because you have it.

16:00.893 --> 16:01.785
Hmm.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.463
Nice. Who taught you how
to be a juice box? Hmm.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.244
Don't worry. I come in peace.

16:21.036 --> 16:22.359
And whatever medicated
shampoo you're using

16:22.360 --> 16:23.564
seems to be doing the trick.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.237
Oh. What do you want?

16:25.238 --> 16:26.723
To restore the natural order.

16:27.651 --> 16:28.809
What are these?

16:28.883 --> 16:30.187
Destruct codes.

16:39.077 --> 16:40.661
Well, that seems
a little excessive.

16:42.949 --> 16:43.998
Joshua.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.645
We were looking for you all over.

16:46.950 --> 16:48.087
Where you going?

16:48.088 --> 16:49.791
I got fired. I'm leaving.

16:49.792 --> 16:52.031
Joshua, we are so sorry.

16:52.677 --> 16:54.011
Don't apologize.

16:54.064 --> 16:55.314
It's my fault.

16:55.778 --> 16:58.317
Guess that's what I get for
trusting some black guy.

16:59.966 --> 17:00.989
What?

17:01.075 --> 17:02.235
When you found the trampoline,

17:02.236 --> 17:04.981
I thought the only way to protect
it was to let you use it.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.351
Guess it goes to prove
what I already knew:

17:07.621 --> 17:10.035
non-whites ruin everything.

17:12.772 --> 17:13.952
Oh, my God.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.632
Joshua was racist.

17:16.799 --> 17:18.310
That came out of nowhere.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.608
Did it?

17:23.277 --> 17:25.492
A place free from darkness.

17:25.895 --> 17:28.383
And some are just natural jumpers.

17:29.545 --> 17:31.195
It's going to be a maze.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.698
Maybe I just didn't
want to believe it.

17:37.308 --> 17:38.888
Maybe that's the lesson here.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.771
Purity that demands exclusion...

17:42.157 --> 17:43.857
Isn't real purity.

17:45.119 --> 17:46.729
Maybe paradise is a lie.

17:46.730 --> 17:47.948
Not exactly.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.454
Paradise exists.

17:51.975 --> 17:53.130
Right here.

17:53.545 --> 17:56.015
For once... he's actually right.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.025
Let me buy you some ice cream.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.427
My white guilt is
doing somersaults.

18:02.445 --> 18:03.660
Worth it.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.058
Ahh, paradise.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.955
Hey! Horse-neck.

18:18.751 --> 18:21.254
So...What's with the clothes?

18:21.255 --> 18:24.316
I mean, you look like a toddler
who got dressed in the dark.

18:24.317 --> 18:26.073
Aww, snap!

18:26.074 --> 18:27.706
Here it comes, y'all!

18:27.707 --> 18:29.012
Look at your face.

18:29.013 --> 18:32.738
It's like your mom was a lizard
who got raped by a muppet.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.371
And that burn was brought
to you by the letter "s,"

18:36.372 --> 18:37.826
as in snap!

18:38.557 --> 18:39.621
What?

18:39.622 --> 18:41.435
Too hurt to respond?

18:42.153 --> 18:44.210
Uhh! That's right.

18:44.211 --> 18:45.991
You don't have feelings.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.273
See, the rest of us feel
ashamed of ourselves,

18:48.274 --> 18:51.368
so we act like bitches to
make ourselves feel better.

18:51.369 --> 18:52.984
But you did it to fit in.

18:52.985 --> 18:54.808
And no matter how hard you try,

18:55.246 --> 18:56.709
you never will.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.405
Snap. Snap!

18:59.406 --> 19:02.172
Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!

19:02.173 --> 19:04.600
Give it up! Ooh! Ooh! Snap! Snap!

19:05.860 --> 19:06.975
Yeah! Snap! Snap!

19:06.976 --> 19:10.781
Snap, snap, snap! Woof! Woof!

19:15.521 --> 19:16.805
Abed, are you okay?

19:16.806 --> 19:18.375
That was so cruel.

19:18.441 --> 19:19.568
I deserved it.

19:19.646 --> 19:22.415
I should have never been mean to
anybody, least of all you guys.

19:22.489 --> 19:24.419
I was trying so hard to fit
in that I took it too far.

19:24.421 --> 19:25.523
We took it too far.

19:25.524 --> 19:27.286
We became the kind of
women that we hate,

19:27.287 --> 19:28.905
and we turned you into a monster.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.297
The kind of monster that
makes outlandish statements

19:31.298 --> 19:32.686
about someone's weight.

19:32.687 --> 19:33.990
Those kind of things hurt.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.401
Even when they're not true.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.306
And all because
we were insecure.

19:37.307 --> 19:38.166
Everyone is.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.877
Even Tom Cruise knows
he's short and nuts.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.185
We're at the mercy of
each other and ourselves.

19:42.284 --> 19:44.285
That's why there has to be
forgiveness on both sides.

19:44.358 --> 19:46.520
- Aww... 
- Abed...

19:47.156 --> 19:49.186
Oh, my goodness.
What happened to Pierce?

19:49.221 --> 19:50.479
Long story.

19:50.867 --> 19:51.978
Men.

19:51.995 --> 19:53.011
Yeah.

19:55.622 --> 19:57.382
Damn it, Pierce,
will you knock it off?

19:57.428 --> 19:59.912
I told you,
I'm not controlling it.

20:00.345 --> 20:02.205
There's a little man inside.

20:03.865 --> 20:05.580
- Hi.
- Pierce!

20:05.800 --> 20:08.357
Listen, I wanted to
let you know, Pierce,

20:08.358 --> 20:12.518
it's okay to exceed the
recommended daily dosage.

20:12.871 --> 20:15.719
And don't let anybody
tell you different!

20:18.787 --> 20:21.464
Who's going to be in charge of
making sure he doesn't O.D.?

20:23.324 --> 20:25.759
What? What... When did
we start doing that?

20:28.678 --> 20:31.989
Aaaaaaa Troy and Abed in the mornin'

20:31.990 --> 20:33.394
and we're back with Greendale's

20:33.395 --> 20:35.536
resident animal expert,
star-burns.

20:35.628 --> 20:36.804
My name's Alex.

20:36.805 --> 20:39.541
Star-burns joins us with
his pet turtle, Shelly.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.185
Now, I understand Shelly can
eat over five mice a day.

20:42.186 --> 20:45.207
- That's impressive.
- Turtles don't eat mice.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.538
- What do they eat?
- I don't know.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.617
Pellets? I have no idea.

20:49.630 --> 20:51.025
- That's disappointing.
- That's not good.

20:51.026 --> 20:52.448
Look, what is going on here?

20:52.449 --> 20:54.322
I was studying for
my econ midterm.

20:54.323 --> 20:56.318
You guys walk in,
you hand me this turtle,

20:56.319 --> 20:58.644
and then you tell me to
smile for the folks at home.

20:58.645 --> 21:00.352
What folks at home?

21:01.258 --> 21:03.753
- Ohh.
- Star-burn...

21:03.754 --> 21:06.206
