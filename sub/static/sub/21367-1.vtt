NARRATOR: In the
year one million

00:19.587 --> 00:26.394
BC, when great beasts still
roamed the earth and survival

00:26.494 --> 00:31.065
was a daily struggle,
before dolphins were exiled

00:31.165 --> 00:36.170
to the sea, before
dinosaurs took to the skies,

00:36.270 --> 00:40.341
one tiny band of
early humans fought

00:40.441 --> 00:43.444
to protect their
way of life against

00:43.544 --> 00:50.818
the cruel, prehistoric monster
known as the BC Butcher.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.454
[music playing]

03:31.312 --> 03:33.981
After all that
we've done for you.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.716
I'm sorry.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.584
Ha.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.051
Sorry?

03:38.151 --> 03:41.355
You violated the laws
of our clan, Dina.

03:41.455 --> 03:45.092
You were planning on
anteloping with my man.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.227
And you're sorry?

03:47.328 --> 03:51.565
Of course you are now, now
that you've been caught.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.934
Don't you know Rex
never would have left

03:54.034 --> 03:55.803
with you in the first place?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.738
We are happily in love.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.572
Oh, yeah?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.841
Well, where is Rex now, Neandra?

04:00.941 --> 04:01.809
[gulp]

04:05.178 --> 04:06.680
Neandra, lay off it.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.849
You know just as
well as anyone here

04:08.949 --> 04:10.284
that Rex is two-timing you.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.686
Don't pretend like
you two are so happy.

04:12.786 --> 04:17.325
Me warned you from the
start, Neandra, dear.

04:17.425 --> 04:21.028
Rex, him is a no
good knuckle dragger.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.863
I told you this would happen.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.533
Shut, up, all of you!

04:25.633 --> 04:28.669
Rex would never even
look at this mammoth,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.971
so enough of that.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.340
I know he loves me.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.145
Well, since you're
going to kill me anyways,

04:38.245 --> 04:40.481
I might as well tell you.

04:40.581 --> 04:45.252
Tell me what, you
filthy fossil licker?

04:45.353 --> 04:46.387
I'm pregnant.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.796
This is what you get, Dina!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.865
You deserve this!

04:57.965 --> 05:00.267
Oh, you had it coming!

05:00.368 --> 05:04.405
[music playing]

05:50.418 --> 05:51.919
Attention, everyone.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.328
I would like to just take
a moment and honor today.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.565
There is great cause
for celebration.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.501
We discovered the
truth about our dear,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.803
dear tribeswoman Dina.

06:09.903 --> 06:14.575
She was a dust-brained,
twig-snapping boulder.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.410
So we got rid of her.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.146
[cheering]

06:20.514 --> 06:23.584
Leaving only us pure,
faithful members.

06:23.684 --> 06:28.856
We weeded out the bad, and now
we are left only with the best.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.692
I truly love you all.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.495
So thank you for
being the best tribe

06:34.595 --> 06:36.830
a cavewoman could ever ask for!

06:36.930 --> 06:39.132
[cheering]

06:39.232 --> 06:42.970
I'd also like to take a moment
to remind you of our rules,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.806
since they have been
recently violated.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.543
Rule number one--
no one, I repeat,

06:49.643 --> 06:54.882
no one is allowed to
talk to my man Rex.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.283
Repeat after me!

06:56.383 --> 07:00.854
No one is allowed
to talk to Rex.

07:00.954 --> 07:06.460
Rule number two-- straying from
the group without permission

07:06.560 --> 07:08.962
is strictly forbidden.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.364
Straying from the
group without permission

07:11.465 --> 07:13.601
is absolutely forbidden.

07:13.701 --> 07:18.438
And the last rule, the
most important rule,

07:18.539 --> 07:22.309
rule number three--
always treat your leader,

07:22.409 --> 07:25.546
Neandra, with respect.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.015
Always treat
Neandra with respect.

07:31.018 --> 07:34.488
[music playing]

08:35.816 --> 08:39.052
Anaconda, get up and go
alert the rest of them.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.759
Let's get the meat.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.152
OK.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.688
One of you better tell
me what happened to Dina.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.690
Maybe we didn't kill her.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.992
Neandra, what if she's not dead?

09:19.092 --> 09:20.560
Maybe Rex came
and took her away.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.731
You know, tried to
save her and all.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.332
What if we made Rex angry?

09:25.432 --> 09:26.634
Shut up, will you?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.535
I've had enough
of this Rex talk.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.870
Don't be stupid.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.305
You know just as well
as I do that Rex likes

09:32.405 --> 09:35.709
to disappear from time to time.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.613
But he would never run
off with a dead body!

09:39.713 --> 09:47.487
Me sense something real
bad here, something evil.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.223
You say everything's
evil, you old witch.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.159
An animal probably took her.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.427
I mean, we did leave
it out overnight.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.562
What kind of animal
could do that?

09:55.663 --> 09:58.165
She was tied down!

09:58.265 --> 09:58.799
Ana's right.

09:58.899 --> 09:59.967
An animal took her.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.969
You guys are all
so superstitious

10:02.069 --> 10:04.304
that you dismiss the obvious.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.172
Let's leave.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.313
[music playing]

11:13.373 --> 11:15.642
Is everything OK, Neandra?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.177
Footprints.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.578
Footprints?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.981
There were these large
footprints by where

11:21.081 --> 11:22.783
Dina's body should have been.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.719
Did they look dangerous?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.921
Yes, very.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.724
I don't think this was any
old animal that took Dina.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.425
Not human prints.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.895
They were like claws.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.366
I think we have something big in
our midst, like a saber-tooth.

11:39.466 --> 11:43.470
I say we hunt it, kill it
before it kills one of us.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.671
We have to!

11:44.772 --> 11:46.373
I'm glad you understand!

11:46.473 --> 11:47.941
Go alert the rest of the tribe.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.877
We're going to need as
many people as possible!

we saw this thing.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.087
And I heard it.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.588
And I heard it right behind us.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.891
We turned around, and it was
right there looking at me.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.160
And I took my spear,
and I just got it!

13:13.260 --> 13:13.861
And I got it!

13:13.961 --> 13:14.895
And then I strangled it!

13:14.995 --> 13:16.263
I just strangled it!

13:16.363 --> 13:17.697
And I bit its neck off!

13:17.797 --> 13:18.698
It's true.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.868
I saw her bite its neck off.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.202
It was so awesome.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.436
It was so awesome.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
I wish you were there.

13:25.238 --> 13:25.873
Oh, my God.

13:25.973 --> 13:26.806
Thank you, Neandra.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.308
You saved us all.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.442
Oh, please.

13:29.542 --> 13:33.346
It's the absolute least
I could do for my tribe.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.649
This thing was enormous,
and I killed it.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.418
And now we can sleep at night.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.120
And now, we are fed for months!

14:03.043 --> 14:04.644
Oh, I missed you too, Poppy.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.578
I did.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.314
I brought you grapes.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.381
I love grapes!

14:08.481 --> 14:09.616
Seedless?
-Yes.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.483
Mmm, my favorite.

Mmm, Poppy.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.464
Hey, what's up with Neandra?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.499
Does she want me dead yet?

14:26.599 --> 14:27.500
No.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.069
She won't believe anything.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.004
She still thinks that
you two are so in love

14:31.104 --> 14:33.506
and that you're
coming back for her.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.507
It's not fair!

14:34.607 --> 14:35.742
Neandra doesn't deserve that.

No, she doesn't.

are things with Anaconda?

Tonight, meet me at

obvious choice for Rex!

that, right?

to get some meat.

Bamba-- I want them dead!

18:12.058 --> 18:13.560
Kill them.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.895
Kill them all!

18:15.995 --> 18:19.466
Kill them!

18:19.566 --> 18:21.434
Kill them!

18:21.534 --> 18:24.837
Kill them!

18:24.937 --> 18:25.838
Kill them.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.839
Kill them.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.508
I want them dead.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.509
Kill them!

18:32.579 --> 18:34.414
Kill them!

18:34.514 --> 18:35.682
Kill them!

18:50.163 --> 18:51.264
Kill them!

18:53.566 --> 18:57.069
CAVEWOMAN: These sticks
are, like, the best sticks.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.572
I want to make a torture device.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.609
CAVEWOMAN: Where
did you get these?

19:02.709 --> 19:03.843
CAVEWOMAN: I killed it.

19:03.943 --> 19:04.677
CAVEWOMAN: How dare you?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.479
Wasn't it her pet?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.146
CAVEWOMAN: No.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.415
Hey, everyone.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.184
I'd like to tell you a story.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.119
Everyone, shut up!

19:13.220 --> 19:16.856
Ana wants to tell a scary story.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.791
Shh.

19:18.891 --> 19:23.162
I'm going to tell you
guys about the legend

19:23.263 --> 19:28.635
of the butcher, the creature
that stalks our land.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.669
I don't believe this.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.705
This is just a bunch
of ooh, ooh, ooh.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.307
Yeah I don't believe this.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.608
I heard it's true.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.311
Is this the one with
the magical tears?

19:38.411 --> 19:39.346
This isn't scary.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.047
This is a bedtime story.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.349
Ho and Po, be quiet.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.683
I want to hear the story.

19:43.783 --> 19:49.121
Well, as the legend
goes, many years ago,

19:49.222 --> 19:53.025
people from this tribe
began to go missing,

19:53.125 --> 19:57.564
all under mysterious
circumstances.

19:57.664 --> 20:03.069
One by one, they were
snatched up just like that.

20:03.169 --> 20:03.903
Shh.

20:07.173 --> 20:07.907
[gasp]

20:08.007 --> 20:08.741
Shh.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.446
[gasp]

20:13.546 --> 20:14.281
Shh.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.718
[duck quacking]

20:18.818 --> 20:19.719
Shh.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.789
And every time
someone went missing,

20:22.889 --> 20:28.160
these big animal-like
prints were left behind,

20:28.261 --> 20:32.131
unlike anything anyone
had ever seen before.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.667
Hey, maybe that's
what snatched up Dina.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.168
Quite plausible.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.103
What are you doing?

20:37.203 --> 20:38.271
I killed the beast.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.139
We just ate it tonight.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.508
And in the legend
of the creature,

20:41.608 --> 20:44.176
there wasn't anything
about footprints.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.845
There might have been.

20:45.945 --> 20:46.713
How do you know?

20:56.022 --> 20:58.758
I'm just playing, Neandra.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.660
You killed the beast.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.695
We all know it.

21:02.795 --> 21:03.796
And thank you, too.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.134
Sit down!

21:08.234 --> 21:11.704
[music playing]

21:44.371 --> 21:45.672
Poppy!

21:45.772 --> 21:46.305
Poppy!

21:46.406 --> 21:50.076
[music playing]

21:57.684 --> 22:00.553
Kill them!

22:00.653 --> 22:01.388
Oh, Rex!

22:01.488 --> 22:02.288
Let's leave right now.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.590
It's the perfect moment.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.024
Neandra and everyone
else, they're all sleep,

22:05.124 --> 22:06.058
and they will be for a while.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.560
And I just cannot send longer--

22:07.660 --> 22:14.333
Poppy, OK, my
flower, your two lips.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.835
But first, I have
a little surprise.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.708
Blankie, spankie.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.243
Me hunt mammoth for you, Poppy.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.145
Oh, Rex, I love you.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.714
Yes, I know.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.117
[music playing]

22:47.199 --> 22:47.934
Oh, Rex.

22:48.034 --> 22:48.935
I love you.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.336
I know.

22:50.437 --> 22:55.307
[growling]

22:55.408 --> 22:58.911
[music playing]

24:01.808 --> 24:02.408
Ana!

24:02.509 --> 24:03.275
Anaconda, dear!

24:03.375 --> 24:05.812
Mmm, rolling stones.

24:05.912 --> 24:06.445
Wake up.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.915
Something is wrong!

24:09.015 --> 24:09.849
Neandra!

24:09.949 --> 24:11.450
Me heard a scream!

24:11.551 --> 24:13.553
Bad things are happening!

24:13.653 --> 24:15.287
I can feel it.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.889
Bad, bad, things.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.695
Oh, Mick Jagger.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.835
Something very bad.

24:32.338 --> 24:33.239
CAVEWOMAN: Where's Poppy?

24:33.339 --> 24:34.473
CAVEWOMAN: Where's Poppy?

24:34.574 --> 24:35.842
CAVEWOMAN: She's
here every morning.

24:35.942 --> 24:36.676
Where is she?

24:36.776 --> 24:37.644
CAVEWOMAN: I don't know, guys.

24:37.744 --> 24:38.845
Who cares? [inaudible].

24:41.714 --> 24:44.617
CAVEWOMAN: I bet she
ran off with Rex.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.619
CAVEWOMAN: I haven't
seen Poppy since the moon

24:46.719 --> 24:47.920
was over to the left.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.057
OK, so here's what
I think happened.

24:51.157 --> 24:51.958
Here's Rex.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.025
Rex?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.160
And here's Poppy.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.494
This is Poppy?

24:55.595 --> 24:58.230
And I think the two of
them ran away together.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.065
Poppy?

25:01.934 --> 25:03.302
Poppy.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.371
Me tried to warn
you last night.

25:05.471 --> 25:08.140
Me tried to warn all of you.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.042
But no, none of you listen.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.444
And now, Poppy is gone!

25:12.545 --> 25:13.746
Poppy!

25:13.846 --> 25:16.949
So young, so full of life.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.284
And now she gone!

25:18.384 --> 25:19.118
Gone!

25:23.756 --> 25:27.193
Mamba, don't get so
worked up about it.

25:27.293 --> 25:30.296
We'll go and look for her,
and you can come, too.

25:30.396 --> 25:33.165
Poppy was just a child.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.935
She'd never go anywhere
without telling someone.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.571
She'd announce it
to the whole tribe.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.839
That's not the Poppy I knew.

25:39.939 --> 25:40.539
What?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.408
Oh, nothing, nothing.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.812
Ana, where could the girl be?

25:45.912 --> 25:48.581
Why don't we leave and
look for her right now?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.750
As soon as we find her,
you'll see there's absolutely

25:50.850 --> 25:53.285
nothing to worry about.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.153
Poppy?

25:54.253 --> 25:55.822
Poppy?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.089
Poppy?

25:57.189 --> 25:58.257
Poppy?

25:58.357 --> 25:59.158
Poppy?

25:59.258 --> 25:59.992
Poppy?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.497
[music playing]

26:05.598 --> 26:06.933
Ana.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.267
That way.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.168
OK.
Why not?

26:09.268 --> 26:10.036
Let's go--

26:10.136 --> 26:10.803
Ana!

26:10.903 --> 26:12.504
I think I found something!

26:12.605 --> 26:13.673
Bamba, stay right here.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.041
I'll be right back.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.277
[music playing]

26:41.200 --> 26:43.936
Something awful.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.139
[music playing]

26:53.846 --> 26:56.783
You thought you
found Poppy, Neandra?

26:56.883 --> 26:58.651
You thought a little
lizard was Poppy.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.186
It wasn't a lizard!

27:00.286 --> 27:01.287
It was a Raptorex.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.621
So quit it!

27:02.722 --> 27:04.256
Have you've forgotten
what Poppy looked like?

27:04.356 --> 27:06.325
I only said I heard something.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.427
And looks, not looked.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.197
She's not dead, just missing.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.200
[growl]

27:14.300 --> 27:15.501
Bamba!

27:15.601 --> 27:17.403
I thought I told
you to stay here!

27:17.503 --> 27:18.270
Bamba!

27:21.573 --> 27:23.175
There you are, Bamba!

27:23.275 --> 27:26.445
We didn't find anything,
just a little lizard.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.247
Neandra thought she heard Poppy.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.417
[music playing]

27:40.793 --> 27:42.929
What is it?

27:43.029 --> 27:44.130
Nothing!

27:44.230 --> 27:45.164
Must have been a lizard!

27:53.505 --> 27:54.841
She'll be back.

27:54.941 --> 27:59.245
And when she is back, well,
I'll sure be mad at her,

27:59.345 --> 28:01.247
making us worry like this.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.416
Poor little girl.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.384
Anaconda?

28:05.484 --> 28:06.685
Huh?

28:06.786 --> 28:07.887
NEANDRA: Why do you just
sit there like that?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.889
You're not thinking about Poppy?

28:09.989 --> 28:11.423
You're not worried where she is?

28:11.523 --> 28:16.528
Oh, I'm thinking-- thinking
about where Poppy might be.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.031
I have my own little
theory, Neandra.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.400
And I wasn't going
to offer it because I

28:21.500 --> 28:22.802
didn't want to offend you.

28:22.902 --> 28:26.272
But now, since you're so
interested in my thoughts

28:26.372 --> 28:30.009
on Poppy's whereabouts, I
might as well just tell you.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.043
Go on.

28:31.143 --> 28:31.844
Tell me.

28:31.944 --> 28:35.014
I want to hear this theory.

28:35.114 --> 28:35.647
Rex.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.283
That's my theory.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.584
Rex?

28:38.684 --> 28:40.119
That's not even a theory.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.856
Nobody here understands your
crazy theories, Anaconda.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.826
I think it's pretty
easy to comprehend.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.061
First Dina gets
killed, so then Rex

28:49.161 --> 28:52.698
runs away with Poppy,
innocent Poppy,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.733
because he would
do anything to get

28:54.834 --> 28:57.169
out of your controlling grasp.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.672
And don't tell me the thought
didn't run through your head.

29:00.773 --> 29:04.276

29:11.750 --> 29:14.220
Stop it, dinosaur head!

30:49.348 --> 30:50.616
I am the leader!

30:50.716 --> 30:52.618
I saved the tribe!

30:52.718 --> 30:54.620
I killed the beast!

30:54.720 --> 30:56.222
Listen to me!

30:56.322 --> 30:57.623
Listen to me!

30:57.723 --> 31:01.227
[music playing]

31:25.084 --> 31:26.185
Listen to me!

31:29.888 --> 31:33.025
I know I keep saying that Poppy
ran off with Neandra's man.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.862
But what it that's
not the truth?

31:36.963 --> 31:39.398
What if she's dead?

31:39.498 --> 31:41.767
It's likely, Ana.

31:41.867 --> 31:45.237
I'm so worried about Poppy.

31:45.337 --> 31:48.274
Don't mention that
troglodyte's name again!

31:48.374 --> 31:51.643
She decided to leave
us, and she did.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.645
There's no point
in dwelling on it.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.414
Neandra!

31:55.514 --> 31:57.616
Poppy didn't leave.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.785
She was taken.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.954
We are being hunted.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.755
Can't you see?

32:03.855 --> 32:04.856
I killed the beast!

32:04.957 --> 32:06.658
I saved our tribe!

32:06.758 --> 32:07.926
And you are our leader.

32:08.027 --> 32:11.197
And I-- yes.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.965
You know, I think
we need something

32:13.065 --> 32:15.034
to take our mind off all this.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.269
What do you say we
go gathering, huh?

32:17.369 --> 32:18.437
Sure.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.438
Yeah.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.975
[music playing]

32:58.644 --> 33:02.881
Neandra, I am sure
Rex is coming back.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.517
I'm sorry for all
I said earlier.

33:05.617 --> 33:09.388
Yeah, he's probably planning
on surprising me with something.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.589
I'm sure he is.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.468

33:55.834 --> 33:57.703
No need to worry.

33:57.803 --> 34:01.073
Ana won't forget
me for too long.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.775
Maybe we'll just
sit here and wait.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.018
All done.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.489
[music playing]

34:18.590 --> 34:20.426
The butcher!

34:20.525 --> 34:23.762
[music playing]

34:25.197 --> 34:30.402
Oh, we left Bamba behind!

34:30.502 --> 34:32.003
I'll get her.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.639
You go back and
take these rocks.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.246
Tell the old witch I'm sorry.

34:48.687 --> 34:49.420
Bamba?

34:53.559 --> 34:54.293
Bamba?

34:59.064 --> 35:02.000
Maybe we shouldn't
take a blind person--

35:02.100 --> 35:05.571
[music playing]

35:09.141 --> 35:09.875
Impossible!

35:12.611 --> 35:13.645
I saved everyone!

35:16.615 --> 35:19.318
You just wanted to prove
a point, didn't you?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.925
You cro-mag, Bamba!

35:27.025 --> 35:29.395
Why did you do this to me?

35:32.164 --> 35:34.400
Silly, caveman,
you don't say much.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.068
I don't.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.003
Where's Bamba?

35:38.103 --> 35:41.173
I couldn't find her.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.674
But she's all right.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.477
We all know how crazy Bamba
gets during mating season.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.345
True, true.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.179
Me know!

35:49.248 --> 35:51.783
How about we have our
evening theater tonight?

35:51.883 --> 35:52.618
OK.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.787
[music playing]

36:23.349 --> 36:25.517
Thank you for all you've done.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.918
I love you.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.787
Two down, two to go.

36:28.887 --> 36:29.955
We're halfway there.

36:30.055 --> 36:33.692
[music playing]

36:36.628 --> 36:40.666
Ho and Po, that was a
beautiful duck dance.

36:40.766 --> 36:44.870
(CHANTING) Ana,
Ana, Ana, Ana, Ana.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.472
OK, OK.

36:46.572 --> 36:51.209
I've been waiting two moons for
my turn in the evening theater.

36:51.310 --> 36:55.314
And what I'd like to
do is have all of you

36:55.414 --> 36:59.017
participate with me
in a game of charades.

36:59.117 --> 37:02.588
[music playing]

37:08.059 --> 37:08.960
Animal!

37:09.060 --> 37:10.929
[music playing]

37:11.029 --> 37:12.331
Two leg.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.900
[music playing]

37:15.000 --> 37:15.901
T-Rex!

37:16.001 --> 37:18.504
[music playing]

37:18.604 --> 37:19.271
Raptor!

37:19.371 --> 37:20.272
Raptorex!

37:20.372 --> 37:21.873
No, stupid!

37:21.973 --> 37:23.842
CAVEMAN: Monster!

37:23.942 --> 37:24.843
Could be.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.446
[music playing]

37:27.546 --> 37:28.213
Butcher!

37:28.314 --> 37:31.817
[music playing]

37:31.917 --> 37:33.952
Oh, good job, ugly kids.

37:34.052 --> 37:34.786
OK.

37:34.886 --> 37:35.754
Next--

37:35.854 --> 37:36.855
OK.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.858
How about we move on
to something else, hmm?

37:39.958 --> 37:41.192
OK.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.127
How about some music?

37:42.227 --> 37:43.028
[duck quacking]

37:43.128 --> 37:44.229
Hi.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.697
I'm Rodney on the
rock, and I'm here

37:45.797 --> 37:51.002
to introduce to you and my
friend, Duck Duck, a band

37:51.102 --> 37:53.104
that I'm not too sure of.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.239
But give them a chance.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.774
They're called the Ugly Kids.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.378
[music playing]

39:39.911 --> 39:43.715
You know, charades
was a good idea, Ana.

39:43.815 --> 39:44.850
Thanks, Neandra.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.153
But, you know, the Ugly
Kids were really rad.

39:48.253 --> 39:51.022
Rodney and Duck Duck seemed
a little unsure about them.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.792
But I think they rocked.

39:53.892 --> 39:58.029
You know, it's so
silly, us fighting.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.431
And over what?

39:59.531 --> 40:01.533
People have just been
worried, with Dina's body

40:01.633 --> 40:05.537
going missing and then Poppy.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.138
It's all just a
coincidence, them

40:07.238 --> 40:08.940
disappearing at the same time.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.512
Well, Ana, I'm no
longer sure of that.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.416
There's something I need
to tell you, Anaconda.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.351
Oh, and I really
want to hear that.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.887
But can you hold that thought?

40:21.987 --> 40:25.190
I really have to use the
little cavegirl's room.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.827
I'll be right back.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.996
Hey, Ana?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.230
Be careful.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.900
OK, yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.436
[music playing]

40:47.212 --> 40:49.214
[rustling]

40:50.148 --> 40:53.051
Rex, is that you?

40:53.151 --> 40:57.055
[music playing]

41:01.793 --> 41:03.629
Have you seen Anaconda?

41:03.729 --> 41:06.498
I haven't seen her since
the moon lied at level

41:06.598 --> 41:07.966
with the cherimoya trees.

41:08.066 --> 41:08.967
Ana?

41:09.067 --> 41:10.969
Me no see Ana.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.573
[music playing]

41:28.453 --> 41:29.354
No!

41:29.454 --> 41:31.356
[inaudible] the butcher!

41:31.456 --> 41:35.527
[music playing]

41:39.030 --> 41:39.931
No!

41:40.031 --> 41:41.332
No!

41:41.432 --> 41:43.334
No!

41:43.434 --> 41:44.335
No!

41:44.435 --> 41:47.906
[music playing]

42:36.755 --> 42:37.856
Kill Neandra!

42:41.359 --> 42:42.661
That's it!

42:42.761 --> 42:46.231
[music playing]

42:48.233 --> 42:53.471
First Dina's body,
then Poppy, then Bamba.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.406
And I knew, I knew then!

42:55.506 --> 42:58.844
I knew something was wrong!

42:58.944 --> 43:00.746
Now Ana.

43:00.846 --> 43:04.616
Ana could be gone,
gone for good.

43:04.716 --> 43:07.418
Could I have stopped this?

43:07.518 --> 43:10.656
Saved her life?

43:10.756 --> 43:12.691
Bigger beast?

43:12.791 --> 43:15.326
Bigger than the one I killed?

43:15.426 --> 43:16.294
It can't--

43:16.394 --> 43:18.697
[rustling]

43:18.797 --> 43:21.432

43:21.532 --> 43:22.267
Ana!

[music playing]

43:31.209 --> 43:32.477
Rex!

43:32.577 --> 43:34.445
You and Poppy?

43:34.545 --> 43:35.981
I got you something.

43:36.081 --> 43:36.982
A poppy.

43:40.118 --> 43:40.852
Ooh.

43:45.657 --> 43:46.557
saber-tooth!

43:46.658 --> 43:50.161
[music playing]

43:50.261 --> 43:51.129
Ana!

43:51.229 --> 43:55.066
[music playing]

43:58.469 --> 44:00.706
Anaconda, where are you?

44:00.806 --> 44:04.242
[music playing]

44:25.563 --> 44:26.431
No!

44:42.413 --> 44:44.750
The tribe.

44:44.850 --> 44:48.219
The noises don't sound human.

44:48.319 --> 44:49.420
[man wailing]

44:49.520 --> 44:51.256
Not like an animal, either.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.928
I bet it was you.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.065
You're the one who's
responsible for all this.

45:00.165 --> 45:01.699
You snake!

45:01.800 --> 45:05.536
You filthy snake!

45:05.636 --> 45:08.006
It was you who killed
Ana, didn't you?

45:10.641 --> 45:14.946
Whatever you are, you're the
one we've been looking for,

45:15.046 --> 45:17.749
and you're going to die tonight!

45:17.849 --> 45:21.352
[music playing]

46:08.566 --> 46:11.302
The legend, it's true!

46:11.402 --> 46:15.240
You're what has been
killing everyone!

46:15.340 --> 46:17.342
A monster like you?

46:17.442 --> 46:18.576
Ha!

46:18.676 --> 46:22.247
I just thought you'd
be, well, scarier.
