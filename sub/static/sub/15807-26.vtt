<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
     <i> Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:06.371
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.440 --> 00:08.473
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.542 --> 00:10.943
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:11.011 --> 00:13.111
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:13.180 --> 00:15.513
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.582 --> 00:17.783
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.852 --> 00:20.452
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.520 --> 00:22.454
¶ For a three-hour tour ¶

00:22.523 --> 00:25.657
¶ A three-hour tour ¶

00:25.726 --> 00:27.325
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.394 --> 00:29.461
¶ The weather
    started getting rough ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:32.131
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:32.198 --> 00:34.332
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.401 --> 00:36.868
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.937 --> 00:39.304
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:39.373 --> 00:41.473
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore of this ¶

00:41.541 --> 00:44.209
¶ Uncharted desert isle ¶

00:44.278 --> 00:46.110
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:46.179 --> 00:48.413
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.482 --> 00:50.815
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:50.884 --> 00:53.018
¶ And his wife ¶

00:53.087 --> 00:55.921
¶ The movie star ¶

00:55.990 --> 00:57.522
¶ And the rest ¶

00:57.590 --> 01:02.594
¶ Are here
    on Gilligan's Isle ¶

01:21.448 --> 01:24.283
Oh, Gilligan.
     How utterly utterly charmy!

01:24.351 --> 01:25.250
Huh?

01:25.318 --> 01:27.452
You sitting in
        the middle of the jungle

01:27.520 --> 01:29.521
playing
        a percussion instrument.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.589
I thought I was playing a drum.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.192
My dear boy, a drum is
    a percussion instrument.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.128
Oh, let me
percuss for you.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.632
Oh, you've no idea
       what memory this recalls.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.769
All those rapturous hours
   at the Philomene.

01:43.838 --> 01:48.106
Listening to Beethoven
and Brahms and Mozart.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.676
I'm hungry for music,
Gilligan. Hungry.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.378
Care for drumstick?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.180
You give me
the most marvelous idea.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.414
I have?

01:56.483 --> 01:58.383
What is it we need
       on this island?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.285
- A way to get off.
      - Culture.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.355
And what's more
      cultural than music?

02:03.424 --> 02:06.224
Gilligan, we'll form our
 own little symphony orchestra.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.526
And you my dear boy,
you will be the drummer.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.027
In that case, I better
          start practicing, huh?

02:11.097 --> 02:12.063
Uh-huh.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.299

[speaking tribal language]

02:38.158 --> 02:40.325
[shouting]

02:54.374 --> 02:55.874
You know, Thurston,
            it's quite a problem

02:55.943 --> 02:59.478
deciding what to open up
with in our first concert.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.047
What's your opinion of
Brahms' lullaby?

03:02.116 --> 03:04.182
Well, it's great
        if you wanna take a nap.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.719
Hold still,
              you little rascal.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.521
Thurston, I don't like
          your attitude

03:09.590 --> 03:11.490
or your lack of enthusiasm.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.492
It was only last year that
      you gave 5 million dollars

03:14.561 --> 03:16.194
to the New England
             Symphony Orchestra.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.697
That was to keep them
in New England.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.199
Second thought, I think
         we better open up

03:21.268 --> 03:22.567
with Beethoven's V.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.003
I'd like to open up
anybody's V.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.773
Ha, that was
a witty one, Lovey.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.376
Thurston, you're not paying
any attention to me.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.278
But Lovey, why bother
           with an orchestra?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.946
There are more important
        things on this island.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.483
Indispensable things,
        like, say, a polo field.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.053
I'm sorry you feel like that,
but I'm gonna forge ahead.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.923
There's only one thing
   that's holding up our project

03:44.992 --> 03:47.592
and that's finding
              a good conductor.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.161
Symphony, orchestra,
with all the things..

03:50.230 --> 03:51.930
Did you say
a good conductor?

03:51.999 --> 03:56.134
Oh, what you do with your wrist.
The resemblance is fantastic.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.902
You have
      Leonard Bernstein's wrist.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.971
I wonder what he's using
at Lincoln Center.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.040
Oh, darling, I hope
          it's not an imposition

04:02.109 --> 04:04.710
but would you consider
       conducting the orchestra?

04:04.778 --> 04:07.245
Well, I'd have to give it
serious consideration.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.347
- Well--
     - That's enough, yes.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.182
And our first number
will be

04:11.251 --> 04:14.686
"Flight of the
Zumble Bumble Bumblebee."

04:14.754 --> 04:16.688
Oh, I got it.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.523
[drum beats]

04:20.560 --> 04:22.927
- Hi, Skipper, what you doing?
- Hello, Gilligan.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.363
I shall use this branch
to make a baton for myself.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.365
I'm going to conduct
the orchestra.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.367
- You?
     - Certainly, who else?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.369
You think I'm an amateur?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.872
I lead the navy band
      on my destroyer.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.741
- I never knew that.
      - Certainly.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.808
For five years, we almost
got honorable mention.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.545
I didn't know
      you were that good.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.948
Don't you think
this will make a good baton?

04:43.016 --> 04:46.217
'Put your drum down and give me
a hand, will you, Gilligan?'

04:46.286 --> 04:50.689
And, now, when I pull,
you pull with me.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.689
Okay.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.725
Pull!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.360
Pull!

04:59.465 --> 05:01.599
Gilligan, I should have
    known better.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.202
Asking your help is like putting
a fire out with gasoline.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.005
You don't need a belt, Skipper.
Not with that great big--

05:07.074 --> 05:08.740
- 'Gilligan.'
         - Chest.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.676
That's better.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.914
That looks like
                 a good B-flat.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.051
Looks more like
a G to me. Let's see.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.322
B-flat, yeah.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.625
That's a little low.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.863
That's
                  a little high.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.901
- That's perfect.
     - That's my knuckles.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.036
I'm sorry.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.405
It's just
                      not right.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.674
Well, no wonder,
it's longer than the rest.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.509
Here, I'll cut it off,
right there.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.512
Hi, Gilligan.
Hi, Ginger.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.847
- Hi, Mary Ann.
        - Hi.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.083
Hey! Hey,
                 listen to this.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.423
- Recognize this?
       - No.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.593
- It's Melancholy Baby.
    - How about that?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.928
- It's not even finished.
   - It sounds beautiful.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.664
What's the matter
               with you?

06:05.732 --> 06:08.667
Oh, I'm the only one who doesn't
have an instrument to play.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.668
Oh, that's a shame,
      Mary Ann.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.503
Hey, why not
         this one here?

06:12.572 --> 06:15.273
- What?
         - Yeah, watch.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.042
So all you do is, take it like
this and bend it like that.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.344
tung

06:19.413 --> 06:21.613
- Think I can play it?
     - Sure, why not?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.916
- I don't have an ear for music.
- You just need a knee.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.352
tung

06:27.421 --> 06:30.287
Hey! Oh, Gilligan,
              you're wonderful.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.823
tung

06:35.729 --> 06:38.764
¶ Do do do do dah
       Dee dee dee dee ¶¶

06:47.674 --> 06:49.674
Thurston, what are you
          doing with two batons?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.743
Well, when Mickey Mantle
comes to home plate

06:51.812 --> 06:55.680
he always waves
two bats, you see.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.816
Oh, darling, you have
   a magnificent brilliant mind.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.718
And it's ideal
for Rimsky Korsakov.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.255
One for Rimsky
and the other for Korsakov.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.257
As we say in musical circles
Bach to Bach, over there.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.059
Patrons and sponsors,
if you please.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.594
¶ Da da dee dah ¶

07:09.663 --> 07:10.929
¶ Da da da dum ¶

07:10.998 --> 07:13.264
¶ Da da da dum ¶
¶ Da da da dum ¶

07:13.332 --> 07:15.767
¶ Da da da dum ¶

07:15.835 --> 07:18.269
Wait a minute, there's
         an echo in this island.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.771
- It's me, Mr. Howell.
     - Oh.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.172
I see you're getting
ready to conduct.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.241
Yes, I'm just gonna
         say one-ah and a two-ah

07:23.310 --> 07:26.911
to borrow some numbers
 from our friend, Lawrence Welk.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.447
Professor, have you decided
  on your musical instrument?

07:29.515 --> 07:31.282
I have, Mrs. Howell.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.751
If this turns out
as I anticipate

07:32.819 --> 07:34.018
I'll be playing the flute.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.853
Then it will be a flute.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.790
'Cause there isn't enough
   wood there for a cello.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.693
Toodle-oo, I've to make
arrangements for our rehearsal.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.028
Yes, yes.
             Of course, darling.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.531
That's very ingenious, when does
it go back on the assembly line?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.001
Practically finished
right now, Mr. Howell.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.037
[flute music]

07:57.577 --> 07:59.611
That's very good.
        Ready for the rehearsal.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.880
Over there, Professor.
    The conductor, there we are.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.683
[off key music]

08:28.775 --> 08:31.710
[off key music continues]

08:46.960 --> 08:48.559
Just a moment, Mr. Howell.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.595
Just what do you think
you're doing?

08:50.664 --> 08:53.131
I'm getting ready for rehearsal
 for the concert, you see.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.001
Oh, there must be
some misunderstanding.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.537
- You see, I'm the conductor.
 - Oh, no.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.939
You're the Skipper
          and I'm the conductor.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.909
Oh, just hold it, Professor.
I wanna tell you, what is this?

09:04.977 --> 09:08.579
That looks like a long
   toothpick or short pool cube.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.783
It's a baton,
and who made you the conductor?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.052
An impartial judge,
             Mrs. Howell.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.553
I thought so.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.289
For your information, I used to
conduct the band for the Navy.

09:18.357 --> 09:22.293
Well, any music that you
  conducted should be banned.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.694
- Very funny.
         - Yes.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.097
Well, I will prove to you
who is the best conductor.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.966
Professor.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.405
Just a minute, Professor.
       You take it from me.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.308
- I shall lead the orchestra.
- No. I'm leading the orchestra.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.445
Oh, on guard,
Mr. Howell.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.647
You'll take
                     it from me.

09:44.017 --> 09:44.983
Oh!

09:48.655 --> 09:52.489
Quiet. Quiet.
Musicians, hush.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.259
- Gilligan.
          - Oh.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.562
Now, we'll start
       our first number.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.265
One-ah, two-ah, three-ah.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.135
[orchestral music]

10:14.347 --> 10:16.548
[loud horn]

10:16.616 --> 10:18.215
What was that?
    Sounded like a fog horn.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.550
It was.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.053
What is a fog horn
    doing in our orchestra?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.255
I'm sorry, Maestro,
    but it can't be helped.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.624
This is the fog horn
      of the SS Minnow.

10:26.693 --> 10:30.261
Sounds alright to me. We need it
for "Foggy Day in London Town."

10:30.330 --> 10:31.796
Thank you, Ginger.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.898
Now, let's get on with
  Strauss and the Blue Danube.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.335
One-ah, two-ah, three-ah.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.738
[music continues]

10:51.651 --> 10:53.184
Ow!

10:53.253 --> 10:55.220
Musicians, please.

10:55.288 --> 10:59.023
Among all those beautiful notes
that sounded like a clinker.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.858
It's that square
        on the triangle.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.693
This is a very difficult
instrument.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.896
It's easy to play
a wind instrument.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.998
Yeah, especially for you,
   with all that hot air.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.167
Arturo Toscanini.
I've...been insulted.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.439
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
     No temper, more tempo.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.707
(Mrs. Howell)
  'One-ah, two-ah, three-ah.'

11:16.776 --> 11:19.711
[music continues]

11:45.639 --> 11:47.371
[music ends]

11:47.440 --> 11:49.441
[drum beats]

11:57.417 --> 11:58.983
[men shouting]

12:03.889 --> 12:05.589
[drum beat continues]

12:05.658 --> 12:07.459
[speaking tribal language]

12:23.076 --> 12:25.210
[orchestral music continues]

12:50.603 --> 12:52.537
[shouting hysterically]

12:54.908 --> 12:57.808
- Where'd he come from?
    - I don't know.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.610
How dare you interrupt
     our concert.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.179
[speaking tribal language]

13:01.247 --> 13:04.448
Stop with those lame excuses.
You're absolutely uncivilized.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.017
Please, Mr. Howell, I'll try
    to communicate with him.

13:07.086 --> 13:10.355
Uh.<i> Parlez-vous Francais?</i>

13:10.423 --> 13:12.156
<i> Si habla Espanol?</i>

13:12.225 --> 13:13.624
<i> Sprechen sie Deutsch?</i>

13:13.693 --> 13:15.393
Let me try it.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.660
[speaking gibberish]

13:16.729 --> 13:19.197
[replying in tribal language]

13:19.265 --> 13:20.164
- What did he say?
       - Who?

13:20.233 --> 13:21.532
- 'Him.'
        - I don't know.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.868
He just answered you.
     What did he say?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.469
I forgot
               what I asked him.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.137
Oh! Let me handle this!

13:27.206 --> 13:29.007
I'll speak a language that
   everybody understands. Money.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.943
Here, buy yourself
     a mahogany surf board.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.179
Ah, shrewd fellow.
  He wants more. There you go.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.415
Now, give me that back.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.284
According to
      the markings on this knife

13:40.353 --> 13:43.021
I'd say this fellow is a member
 of a fierce primitive tribe.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.955
What's he doing
on this island?

13:45.024 --> 13:46.790
He's probably an advance scout
  for the tribe.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.559
We're in danger
              of being attacked.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.994
We better not
tell the others.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.230
[tribal music]

13:53.700 --> 13:55.033
Look!

13:56.803 --> 13:58.937
[tribals shouting]

14:00.674 --> 14:02.540
[screaming]

14:07.080 --> 14:09.746
- What are we gonna do?
    - Come here, darling.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.950
Stay calm, everybody. We'll head
for the south end of the island.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.953
South. This way.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.161
Oops! wait!

14:25.865 --> 14:27.832
East end. East end.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.934
[screaming]

14:32.672 --> 14:33.872
Wait!

14:38.944 --> 14:40.778
This way.
                   The west end.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.881
The west end.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.517
[comical music]

14:50.357 --> 14:51.322
Look!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.527
What do we do now?
We're all out of ends.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.504
[tribals chattering]

15:09.008 --> 15:11.075
What's going on
                 out there?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.357
[whispering]
    Gilligan. They hear us,
    we're finished.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.460
Skipper, we've gotta
face something.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.763
Those natives are gonna find
the cave where we're hiding.

15:32.832 --> 15:36.367
But if we stay in that cave,
    we're gonna starve to death.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.702
- That's a great idea.
     - What's a great idea?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.306
If we're skin and bones,
  those cannibals won't kill us.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.243
So, if we starve to death
       we'll save our lives.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.622
Oh, I'm so cold.
This cave is freezing at night.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.824
The best way to keep warm is
  to stay close together.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.293
Can we light a fire?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.862
Even my blue blood is
     starting to cube up.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.364
I'm frozen.
    I've got peacock bumps.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.101
- You mean goosebumps.
    - On a howl?

16:10.169 --> 16:13.237
Skipper, I'm freezing.
I'm going numb. I'm going numb.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.140
If everyone wants to keep nice
and warm, I know a perfect way.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.843
- Oh, how?
       - Just follow me.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.577
Brrr.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.946
Where are we going?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.347
We're gonna give ourselves
up to the cannibals

16:23.416 --> 16:26.317
and they'll put us
in a nice hot pot.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.764
I can't see a thing out there.
It's alright to start the fire.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.465
Good, professor.
                Here, Gilligan.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.834
Take these two sticks.
     Start rubbing 'em together.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.236
Aye aye, sir.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.673
[comical music]

16:50.276 --> 16:52.210
Would it be faster
if I helped you?

16:52.278 --> 16:55.012
No, it'd be faster
           if I used my matches.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.981
- Matches. You got matches?
  - Sure.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.482
Why didn't
         you use them?

16:58.551 --> 17:01.152
Because you told me
     to rub two sticks together.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.388
Light that fire.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.758
[fire crackling]

17:07.926 --> 17:09.460
Even with those
savages outside

17:09.529 --> 17:11.261
I feel better now that
we have this fire.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.298
I still got goosebumps,
   but at least they're warm.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.900
If it weren't for those
cannibals, we could have picnic.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.569
Don't mention cannibals
 and picnic in the same breath.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.539
If they find this cave,
   we'll be the main course.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.208
- Thurston.
         - Very vulgar.

17:24.276 --> 17:27.210
At least let me think
of myself as the dessert.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.113
Barbeque, hot dogs
       and hamburgers.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.448
Oh, Gilligan.
Stop the food talk.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.850
- But I'm hungry.
       - Oh, we all are.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.284
We haven't eaten
                for ten hours.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.454
Ten hours.
               Then I'm starved.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.524
Don't mention food.
     It makes us hungrier.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.626
Alright. Alright.
     I won't mention food again.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.362
I won't mention food even
    if you burn me at the stake.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.797
Steak!

17:47.633 --> 17:51.302
Skipper, I recall reading
a Professor Oldenberg's text

17:51.370 --> 17:52.903
on primitive tribes
and customs.

17:52.971 --> 17:56.907
The more primitive the tribe,
the more superstitious it is.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.310
Well, with this bunch
   we must have hit the jackpot.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.579
And they're terrified
of various Gods.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.415
Listen, if we could convince
them that we are Gods

18:04.483 --> 18:07.251
with mystical powers,
they might flee and panic.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.286
Professor, how are we
           gonna do that?

18:09.355 --> 18:10.887
Professor Oldenburg
sighted a case where

18:10.956 --> 18:14.591
he saved his own life by using
a radio on the Papuan Tribe.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.595
They heard voice coming from a
box, thought professor was God.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.431
Well, it's worth a chance.
 In here, we'll starve to death.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.900
- I'll get the radio.
    - Good luck, Professor.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.768
And I'll take Gilligan
along with me.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.105
Lots of luck, Professor.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.381
[tribals chattering]

18:42.054 --> 18:43.821
Let's hope this works.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.556
I sure hope so.
Look at those sharp spears.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.659
I'd hate to wind up
like a shish kebab.

18:48.727 --> 18:49.794
Here goes.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.895
Don't you think you oughta
turn the radio on?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.931
- Oh.
    - Hope it gets 'em good.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.968
(man on radio)
'Tomorrow will be warm and sunny
followed by showers.'

18:58.037 --> 18:59.336
'So don't forget.'

18:59.405 --> 19:02.373
'If you need money,
    drop in at our office.'

19:04.510 --> 19:09.146
'...red tape, just ask
     for friendly help.'

19:09.215 --> 19:11.348
Here you go, Gilligan.
You hold it.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.684
I'm gonna try to hasten
their departure.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.888
(man on radio)
     'Friendly Henry has
     a solid institution..'

19:17.957 --> 19:19.323
[radio stops]

19:19.392 --> 19:21.124
Come on, Henry.
Get friendly again.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.461
[tribals chattering]

19:23.530 --> 19:25.029
Oh-oh.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.898
[shouting]

19:31.537 --> 19:33.671
Where are they?
  They've been gone for hours.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.739
Don't worry, Skipper. Professor
can cope with anything.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.175
That man's got a good
head on his shoulders.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.309
I'm worried
                 about Gilligan.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.312
He's got some on
his shoulders, too.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.380
Except I can't figure
out what it is.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.950
Gilligan, ha ha.
     Where's the Professor?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.684
- They got 'em.
        - 'Oh, no.'

19:47.753 --> 19:49.587
They thought we were Gods until
Friendly Henry stopped talking.

19:49.656 --> 19:53.591
- Who's that?
  - Radio announcer, he was--

19:53.660 --> 19:55.593
Never mind that, Gilligan.
 We've got to go and rescue him.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.793
Right.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.363
Find something to make
          them think we're Gods.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.900
- The flash light.
 - The flash light. Good idea.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.437
[dramatic music]

20:10.209 --> 20:11.809
[snoring]

20:12.912 --> 20:14.778
Oh, the poor Professor.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.713
What happened to him, Gilligan?
 Did you see him?

20:16.782 --> 20:19.449
No, but some of those
natives look fatter.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.885
They've probably got him
        tied up someplace.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.487
I sure hope so.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.523
We'll get him after we
       get rid of these natives.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.026
I'll take the flashlight,
       flash it in their faces

20:29.095 --> 20:31.228
and frighten them into
 thinking we're some kinda Gods.

20:31.297 --> 20:34.232
- Right.
   - Give me the flashlight.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.235
- Come on, Gilligan.
      - Yeah.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.275
[shouting]

20:48.080 --> 20:50.648
I am the God of light.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.517
[tribals growling]

20:54.487 --> 20:56.454
I am the God of light.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.457
[tribals growling]

21:01.026 --> 21:02.292
Gilligan,
it doesn't work.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.595
I guess I forgot
        to put the batteries in.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.633
[shouting]

21:11.738 --> 21:14.437
- Pot! Pot!
        - Uh...big pot!

21:14.506 --> 21:17.174
- Jackie Gleason.
       - Sounds like..

21:17.243 --> 21:19.543
Gilligan, what's the matter?
  Where's the captain?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.712
- They got him.
   - Oh, not the Skipper too.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.413
Oh, you didn't trip
        and drop the flashlight.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.515
No, I forgot
        to put the batteries in.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.785
We've got to rescue them.
Let's go, Gilligan.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.620
- You want me to go along?
   - Yeah, come on, let's go.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.823
- Thurston! Thurston.
- Lovey, my dear, a final word.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.225
What was that charade
we were trying to guess?

21:35.294 --> 21:38.729
The natives are restless
tonight. Ha ha ha.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.068
[natives chattering]

21:48.741 --> 21:50.273
What is that
                   thing anyway?

21:50.342 --> 21:52.276
The fire extinguisher
from the SS Minnow.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.877
We're supposed to rescue
        Professor and Skipper.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.380
Leave the fire
   to Smokey the Bear, will you?

21:56.449 --> 21:58.449
How will we convince those
natives we're Gods?

21:58.517 --> 22:01.819
- Know the white stuff in this?
- It's carbon dioxide.

22:01.887 --> 22:05.489
I'll spray it over my head,
they'll see my hair turn white.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.192
Feel my hair
       turning white, right now.

22:08.261 --> 22:10.394
Mr. Howell,
just follow me.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.898
Watch this now,
                 Mr. Howell.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.567
[shouting hysterically]

22:21.974 --> 22:23.741
[shouting]

22:23.809 --> 22:25.208
Ha ha ha.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.646
How about that? They're all
  scared, thinking I'm God.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.916
- You wanna try it?
    - Yeah, here let my try.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.517
[shouting]

22:38.991 --> 22:42.026
Oh! Wait a minute..

22:42.094 --> 22:43.527
[shouting]

22:49.768 --> 22:53.270
- Poor boy, where's Thurston?
 - They got him.

22:53.339 --> 22:56.973
- He's much too rich to die.
 - He'll be alright. I'm sure.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.543
What do we do now?
      That's the end of the men.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.578
- I'm still here.
      - As I was saying..

23:01.647 --> 23:04.014
I'll show you.
       I'll rescue them.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.016
Don't leave us here alone.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.059
This is where they were,
    but they're gone.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.128
- What's happened to them?
   - Where can they be?

23:17.196 --> 23:20.230
- They had a good meal and left.
- Oh, Gilligan.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.998
It's almost daylight.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.069
Oh, maybe they went
to our camp. Let's go see.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.336
Yeah.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.439
[tribal music]

24:06.512 --> 24:08.645
[tribals shouting]

24:08.714 --> 24:10.648
We're marooned on this island.

24:12.351 --> 24:14.852
They can't understand what we're
saying. They're going anyway.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.554
They liked my drum playing,
I'll give a send off.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.858
- Never mind that now.
     - I wanna be friendly.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.693
[banging drums]

24:27.934 --> 24:29.733
[drums continue]

24:30.936 --> 24:33.170
[speaking tribal language]

25:03.802 --> 25:05.002
¶ Now, this is the tale
    of the castaways ¶

25:05.071 --> 25:07.037
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:07.106 --> 25:09.472
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:09.541 --> 25:11.608
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:11.677 --> 25:13.644
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:13.713 --> 25:15.645
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:15.714 --> 25:17.748
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

25:17.817 --> 25:19.950
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:20.019 --> 25:22.352
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:22.421 --> 25:24.554
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:24.623 --> 25:26.657
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:26.726 --> 25:28.826
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:28.894 --> 25:30.827
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:30.896 --> 25:32.930
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:32.998 --> 25:35.566
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:35.634 --> 25:37.902
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶

25:38.305 --> 25:44.838
