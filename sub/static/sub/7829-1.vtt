No, it's no use.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.208
They ain't talking.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.627
Everyone in Springfield had
a reason to shoot Mr. Burns,

02:07.710 --> 02:08.670
even us.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.004

02:10.088 --> 02:11.798

02:13.883 --> 02:15.385
And Dad, well, you
kinda went berserk

02:21.474 --> 02:24.018
Aren't we forgetting someone--
Sister suspect?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.980
(nervous laugh) Yeah,
I was just getting to me.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.566
Because of Mr. Burns,
they canceled my jazz program

02:29.649 --> 02:31.985
and my friend Tito Puente
got fired...

02:32.068 --> 02:33.945
But I could never
shoot someone.

02:34.028 --> 02:34.988
-Could so.
-Could not.

-Could so.
-Could not.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.075
As far as Daddy's concerned

02:39.159 --> 02:41.244
you're both
potential murderers.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.829
The police already
have a suspect.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.080
It's Mr. Smithers.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.082
-Sure!
-He's a good suspect.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.751
I bet he's the one.
Yeah! Smingers did it.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.087
Case closed.
Now where's my hat?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.547
I'm going

02:52.630 --> 02:54.465
We don't have
an outhouse.

Oh, Dad?

02:56.801 --> 02:58.261

02:58.344 --> 03:01.222
Could I have shot Mr. Burns
in a drunken rage?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.223
No, no, not me!

03:02.307 --> 03:03.558
I know in my heart I...

03:03.641 --> 03:05.143
A gun...

03:05.226 --> 03:07.312
And it's been recently fired.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.190
Wait. I remember
leaving the town meeting.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.862
I must have run into
Mr. Burns outside and...

03:15.945 --> 03:17.322
(muttering)

03:17.405 --> 03:18.573

03:18.656 --> 03:20.408

03:22.327 --> 03:25.205

03:33.087 --> 03:34.756
Hey, Homer--
Us hotheads here

03:34.839 --> 03:37.675

Burns's sunblocking machine.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.718
You want to come with?

03:38.801 --> 03:40.303
Sure.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.139

did we just crush?

04:05.286 --> 04:06.246

04:08.164 --> 04:09.290

This guilt is driving me mad.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.878
I've got to tell someone.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.008
Father, I'm not
a Catholic but--

04:19.092 --> 04:22.220
Well, I tried to march in
the St. Patrick's Day parade.

04:22.303 --> 04:27.058
Anyway, I've got
a rather large sin to confess.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.354
(sniffles)
I'm the one who--

04:31.437 --> 04:34.148
who shot Mr. Burns.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.358
That's all I
needed to hear.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.443
Boy, this thing
works great.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.153
The man became
consumed by greed.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.947
He'd steal from anyone.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.199
This isn't a rival company
you're battling with.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.368
It's a school.
People won't stand for it.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.786
Pish-posh.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.247
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.166
Say, that sounds like a larf.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.752
And when he tried
to steal our sunlight,

04:54.836 --> 04:58.339
he crossed that line between
everyday villainy

04:58.423 --> 04:59.549
and cartoonish super-villainy.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.134
Bah!

05:01.217 --> 05:06.639
He was a rank amateur
compared to Dr. Colossos.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.099
(evil laughter)

05:08.182 --> 05:09.309
Oh... Ow!

05:09.392 --> 05:11.936
(groaning)

05:12.020 --> 05:13.062
When is my lawyer coming?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.150
(clamoring)

05:17.233 --> 05:19.027
Dave Shutton, Springfield
Daily Shopper.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.695
Who are you?
Where are you going?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.322
Do your research,
Shutton.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.073
Kent Brockman,
Channel 6 News.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.867
How does it feel
to be accused

05:25.950 --> 05:27.869
of the attempted murder
of your boss and mentor?

05:27.952 --> 05:30.788
Kent, I feel about
as low as Madonna

05:30.872 --> 05:32.999
when she found out
she missed Tailhook.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.001
I'm going to say, "Ouch!"
for Madonna.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.087
Hey, that's my Madonna gag.
That guy stole my gag.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.797
And you stole it

05:39.881 --> 05:42.175
from last Friday's episode
of "Pardon My Zinger."

05:42.258 --> 05:45.595
Stole, made up-- What's the difference?
(nervous chuckle)

05:45.678 --> 05:48.348
Mr. Smithers must have
seen that program too.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.725
He never misses it.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.602
At the town meeting,
he mentioned

05:52.685 --> 05:54.312
that he watched
Comedy Central.

05:54.395 --> 05:58.483
I made sure to note that,
as it seemed quite unusual.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.692
Ye gods!

05:59.776 --> 06:01.444
To the police station,
Krusty.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.905
I am Melvin Van Horn

06:03.988 --> 06:06.240
and this is my associate,
Hershel Krustofsky.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.742
Hey, hey.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.536
Officers, you have arrested
an innocent man.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.038
Really? Oh, geez.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.207
All right Colossos,
you're free to go,

06:14.290 --> 06:15.750
but stay away
from death mountain.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.044
But all my stuff is there.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.420
(clearing throat)

06:19.504 --> 06:21.881
I was referring
to Wayland Smithers.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.509
Mr. Burns was shot
Friday at 3:00 p.m.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.344
The very time that Smithers
was at home

06:26.427 --> 06:28.346
watching "Pardon My Zinger."

06:28.429 --> 06:30.515
So you see,
he couldn't have done it.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.100
Yes...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.518
You're right. I remember now.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.479
I--I watched that entire show.
In fact...

06:36.562 --> 06:40.274
I left the town meeting early,
so I could get home in time.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.277
SMITHERS (slurring):
I got to run or I'll miss

06:43.361 --> 06:44.570
the opening rank-out.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.365
Get out of my way, please.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.367
Slow down. The sidewalk's
for regular walking,

06:49.450 --> 06:51.202
not for fancy walking.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.830
SMITHERS: Out of my way.
I'm in a hurry.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.040
You simmer down,
I'll let you go.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.292
(gunfire)

06:58.376 --> 07:01.003
So, instead of wounding
an evil old man

07:01.087 --> 07:03.548
I may have killed
an innocent old man.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.508
That's much worse.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.553
About 50,000 volts worse,
if you know what I mean.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.887
(grunting)

07:09.971 --> 07:11.264
Sizzle!

07:11.347 --> 07:14.267
Wait a minute. If a second
old geezer got shot,

07:14.350 --> 07:16.227
how come nobody reported it?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.564
(knocking)

07:19.647 --> 07:21.149
Uh, hi.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.026
Um, could we take
a look at your leg?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.780
Yeah, that's real spruce.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.948
You like it?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.658
Whew, thank God.

07:30.741 --> 07:34.078
Sir, I only hope
you can forgive me

07:34.162 --> 07:35.788
for shooting
your wooden leg.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.957
You shot who
in the what, now?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.917
Okay, Smithers,
you're free to go.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.794
And you, one question.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.713
Do you know who shot Mr. Burns?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.549
'Cause we are really
up the creek on this one.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.636
<i>And with the</i>
<i>prime suspect cleared</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:51.762
<i>and found</i>
<i>completely innocent,</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:53.681
<i>we must now ask ourselves</i>

07:53.764 --> 07:55.725
<i>who could possibly</i>
<i>be as bloodthirsty</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:57.351
<i>as Wayland Smithers?</i>

07:57.435 --> 08:00.021
I guess it's never
the most likely suspect.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.607
Actually, Mom,
in 95% of cases it is.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.984
The rest of the time,
it's usually

08:05.067 --> 08:07.111
some deranged lunatic
who did it for no reason.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.155
Hey, I had
a damn good reason.

08:09.238 --> 08:12.408
He could never remember my name.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.993
Who the devil are you?

08:14.076 --> 08:15.036
(grunting)

08:15.119 --> 08:16.579
(screaming)

08:16.662 --> 08:18.331
Homer Simpson!

08:18.414 --> 08:20.416
My name is Homer Simpson!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.876
Well, I don't think
anyone in this family

08:21.959 --> 08:23.628
is capable of
attempted murder.

08:23.711 --> 08:28.090
Eh, you never know
what you're capable of.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.927
I never thought I could
shoot down a German plane,

08:31.010 --> 08:34.305
but last year
I proved myself wrong.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.224
Nancy Drew says that all you
need to solve a mystery

08:36.307 --> 08:38.434
is an inquisitive temperament
and two good friends,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.561
and I've got an
inquisitive temperament.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.771
Maybe I could help solve this.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.356
(groans)

08:43.439 --> 08:44.857
I think you're
a little young

08:44.941 --> 08:46.609
to be investigating
an attempted murder.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.070
Why don't you try
to solve the mystery

08:49.153 --> 08:51.197
of who put that mud
in the freezer?

08:51.280 --> 08:53.449
Who wants chocolate ice cream?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.450
Me, me, me, me!

08:56.369 --> 08:59.163
Okay, boys, we've got a clue.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.999
The bullet they
took out of Burns.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.546
Now, let's discuss
the uh... mo-tive.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.756
LISA: Mr. Burns is the
richest man in town.

09:08.839 --> 09:09.924
Maybe it's about money.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.217
That's some good
thinking, Lou.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.260
Hey, thanks, Chief.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.302
LISA: Hey, I said that!

09:13.386 --> 09:14.971
My name is Lisa Simpson,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.515
and I made a chart of all
the suspects in the Burns case.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.310
Look. Mr. Burns hurt
all these people financially.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.187
<i>Nightclub owner Moe Szyslak.</i>

09:23.271 --> 09:25.773
<i>His bar was closed because</i>
<i>of Burns's negligence.</i>

09:25.856 --> 09:27.858
<i>Liquor connoisseur</i>
<i>Barney Gumble.</i>

09:27.942 --> 09:30.278
<i>When Moe's closed Barney lost</i>

09:30.361 --> 09:32.905
<i>Sucking coins out of</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
That's a real good way
to get sick.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.243
<i>LISA: Dedicated educator</i>
<i>Principal Seymour Skinner.</i>

09:37.326 --> 09:38.619
<i>His school lost millions</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:40.913

And what about that jazz teacher
that got laid off,

09:49.046 --> 09:52.508
you know, uh, Mr. Samba,
Señor Mambo-- What was it?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.843
-Tito Puente?
-Yeah.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.636
Well, he did vow revenge.
(chuckles)

09:57.555 --> 09:59.307
But I can't see him
doing something illegal.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.350
He's in show business,
he's a celebrity.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.893
Let's roll, boys.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.895
(police siren blares)

10:06.647 --> 10:07.940
Revenge? Of course--

10:08.024 --> 10:09.817
But why wound
his body with bullets

10:09.900 --> 10:13.070
when I could set his soul afire
with a slanderous mambo?

10:13.154 --> 10:15.823
Listen, if you will,
to my revenge.

Okay, okay,

Gee, I hope all the suspects
are this much fun.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.142
Hmm...

11:26.769 --> 11:29.355
Now...

11:29.438 --> 11:31.691
Now let...

11:31.774 --> 11:34.193
Let me...

11:34.276 --> 11:35.194
Let me think.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.320
Oh.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.321
Now I did...

11:37.405 --> 11:38.781
I did go to the town meeting

11:38.864 --> 11:41.283
with the intention
of ambushing Mr. Burns.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.079
When it adjourned, I rushed
to the lavatory to apply

11:45.162 --> 11:47.248
my camouflage makeup.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.167
Blast! I took mother's
makeup kit by mistake.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.211
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.754
Superintendent Chalmers!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.840
Oh, my God!

11:55.923 --> 11:57.842
(distant gunshot)

11:57.925 --> 12:00.553
So Superintendent Chalmers
can vouch for your whereabouts?

12:00.636 --> 12:03.514
Oh, yes, but anything else
he tells you is a filthy lie.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.143
I'm telling ye,
I could nay have shot Burns.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.438
-(groans)
-(gun cocks)

12:10.521 --> 12:12.022
This is your last warning
about that.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.984
It's impossible for me
to fire a pistol.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.194
If you'll check
my medical records

12:17.278 --> 12:19.822
you'll see I have
a crippling arthritis

12:19.905 --> 12:21.449
in me index fingers.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.908
Look at them.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.370
I got it from Space Invaders
in 1977.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.330
Yeah, that was a pretty
addictive video game.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.874
Video game?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.208
Do you hold a grudge
against Montgomery Burns?

12:31.292 --> 12:32.626
-No.
-(buzzes)

12:32.710 --> 12:34.754
Alright, maybe I did
but I didn't shoot him.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.255
(dings)

12:36.338 --> 12:37.631
Checks out. Okay sir,
you're free to go.

12:37.715 --> 12:38.674
Good, cause I got
a hot date tonight.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.675
(buzzes)

12:39.759 --> 12:40.926
-A date.
-(buzzes)

12:41.010 --> 12:42.011
-(buzzes)
-Dinner with a friend.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.220
-Dinner alone.
-(buzzes)

12:43.304 --> 12:44.388
-Watching TV alone.
-(buzzes)

12:44.472 --> 12:46.140
All right!

12:46.223 --> 12:47.391
I'm gonna sit at home
and ogle the ladies

12:47.475 --> 12:48.851
in the Victoria's Secret
catalog.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.061
(buzzes)

12:51.145 --> 12:52.480
-Sears catalog.
-(beeps)

12:52.563 --> 12:54.440
Would you unhook this
already, please?!

12:54.523 --> 12:56.358
I don't deserve this
kinda shabby treatment.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.610
(buzzes)

12:57.693 --> 12:59.445
Grandpa, I found
your cigar box

12:59.528 --> 13:01.030
dug up in the back yard,
but the gun wasn't there.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.615
Have you seen it?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.284
You accuse me of everything
around here.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.870
"Who put slippers
in the dishwasher?

13:07.953 --> 13:10.623
"Who threw a cane at the TV?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.125
Who fell into the China hutch?"

13:13.209 --> 13:15.085
I was just asking
if you'd seen it.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.629
There's no need
to be a prickly pear.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.008
Oh, you're
the bee's knees, baby.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.593
I missed you bad.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.178
Were you talking
to me, Grandpa?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.889
Um... Yes.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.140
Ew...

13:28.224 --> 13:29.767
We're still not close.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.437
Boy! This is gonna be
an all-night brainbuster.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.523
Yep, better drink some coffee.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.567
Oh, we're out of coffee.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.612
Oh, well, I'll just drink
this warm cream.

13:41.695 --> 13:45.783

13:54.416 --> 14:00.464
(distorted)

14:04.677 --> 14:09.390
(distorted)

14:09.473 --> 14:10.391
Huh?

14:15.563 --> 14:16.522
I'm not following you.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.361
Huh?

14:22.444 --> 14:25.406
(normal voice)
Look at Burns's suit! Yeesh!

14:25.489 --> 14:26.907
Huh?!

14:26.991 --> 14:28.492
I had an idea, Chief.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.952
Why don't we
check out that suit

14:30.035 --> 14:31.579
Burns was wearing
when he got shot?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.247
Did you have the same
backwards-talking dream

14:33.330 --> 14:34.707
with the flaming cards?

14:34.790 --> 14:35.708
I'll drive.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.046
Eureka!

14:42.965 --> 14:44.967
Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?

14:45.050 --> 14:47.136
No. We need to find out
who it belonged to.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.304
We want a DNA test.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.471
Ooh-ooh-ee-ooh-oh.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.849
That takes eight
to ten weeks.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.642
(sighs)

14:53.726 --> 14:55.185
Did I say weeks?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.186
'Cause I meant seconds.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.941
What do you got, the whole
town's DNA on file?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.818
Uh-huh. If you've
ever handled a penny,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.528
the government's
got your DNA.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.113
Why do you think
they keep 'em in circulation?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.489
Scan's finished.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.450
Now it's going
to narrow it down

15:09.533 --> 15:10.910
to the family bloodline.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.536
♪♪ (fanfare)

15:12.620 --> 15:14.163

15:15.372 --> 15:16.373
Bingo.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.751
Our gunman
has a name-o.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.294
-Chief, Chief!
-Chief.

(clamoring)

15:22.171 --> 15:23.505
(gasps)

15:26.342 --> 15:27.301
Hey, Chief Wiggum
what are you doing?

15:27.384 --> 15:29.345
What's going on?

15:29.428 --> 15:32.222
I'm sorry, kid. We got
Simpson DNA on Burns's clothing

15:32.306 --> 15:34.892
and your father was identified by
the old man himself.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.018
(all gasp)

15:36.101 --> 15:38.395
DNA, positive I.D.

in any court.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.398
-Run, Dad!
-Hey ho.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.943
Look what I found
under Mr. Simpson's car seat.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.447
I swear! I've never
seen that gun before.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.990
Then why are your fingerprints
all over it, sir?

15:50.074 --> 15:50.991
(yelps)

15:54.870 --> 15:58.248
This bullet matches the one
we took out of Burns.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.376
Homer Simpson,
you're under arrest

16:00.459 --> 16:01.543
for attempted murder.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.878
D'oh!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.672
Yeah, that's what
they all say--

16:04.755 --> 16:06.215
They all say "D'oh."

16:12.930 --> 16:14.848
WIGGUM: Yeah,
we need two cups of coffee,

16:14.932 --> 16:16.850
and two orders of bite-sized
breakfast pancakes

16:16.934 --> 16:18.644
with extra dipping sauce.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.939
<i>MAN: Please pull up to</i>
<i>the service window, please.</i>

16:22.022 --> 16:24.191
The wagon's too tall.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.859
I don't want
to have to get out.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.736
I'll just drive up
on the curb.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.782
(grunting)

16:31.865 --> 16:32.783
Blug.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.451
Almost got it.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.494
Drop the food,
Chief.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.954
(yelling)

16:37.037 --> 16:38.622
(horn sounds)

16:38.706 --> 16:39.748
Dang fools.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.874
Drive-through's not for parking.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.837
(yells)

16:49.174 --> 16:51.677
Diane, I'm going
to take my break now.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.930
Hi, everybody.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.890
Ho! Mer... Simp... Son.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.143
Okay, that was
a little strange.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.436
Um...

17:00.519 --> 17:02.062
Tell me, how are
you feeling today?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.480
Homer.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.481
Simpson Homer.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.442
D-oh... Simpson!

17:06.525 --> 17:09.945
Hmm. That seems to be
all you can say.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.739
When you were
in that coma,

17:11.822 --> 17:14.116
did you feel your brain
getting damaged?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.785
The police have such
a strong case against Homer.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.120
Mr. Burns said
he did it.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.288
They have Homer's DNA--

17:19.371 --> 17:21.081
They have Simpson DNA.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.666
It could have come
from any of us.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.418
Except you,
since you're a Bouvier.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.879
No, no, no, when I took
your father's name

17:26.962 --> 17:29.715
I took everything that came with it,
including DNA.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.133
Okay, Mom.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.801
Anyway, my point is

17:32.885 --> 17:35.345
the evidence isn't
as concrete as it seems.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.930
Like those fingerprints.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.724
They could have gotten
on the gun some other way.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.435
Are you sure you don't
want me to hold

17:41.518 --> 17:42.811
one of your ice cream cones?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.688
Yeah, right.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.024
You chose fruit.
You live with fruit.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.067
D'oh!

17:48.150 --> 17:49.068
Oh...

17:49.151 --> 17:51.153
No... No... No.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.739
Ew! Why is this
on the floor?

17:55.657 --> 17:58.243
And we don't even know
whose gun that was.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.914
Maybe somebody planted
it there to frame Dad.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.707
No, we can't start
thinking that way

18:03.791 --> 18:05.209
about our own
family members.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.795
Suspicion could
tear us apart.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.546
That's right.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.215
We all got
to stick together

18:11.298 --> 18:13.509
if we're gonna have
any hope of bringing

18:13.592 --> 18:15.302
that awful Homer
to justice.

18:16.970 --> 18:20.099
Here is a photo of
the fugitive from our files.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.892
And now, Wayland Smithers,

18:21.975 --> 18:23.769
who's been a real good sport

18:23.852 --> 18:24.895
about that
wrongful arrest thing...

18:24.978 --> 18:26.396
(whistles)

18:26.480 --> 18:28.023
Has a statement
that he would like to make.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
-Wayland?
-Thank you.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.860
As Montgomery Burns's
closest friend,

18:31.944 --> 18:33.445
I'm certain that there
is nothing he'd want more

18:33.529 --> 18:36.949
than swift, brutal revenge
against Homer Simpson.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.993
Therefore, I am offering
a $50,000 reward

18:40.077 --> 18:42.621
for his capture...
Dead or alive.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.123
Holy cow!
Me first! Me first!

18:45.666 --> 18:46.750
Homer Simpson?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.920
So, you finally
learned my name, eh?

18:50.003 --> 18:52.464
Homer Simpson.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.550
I've got no time for your
demented parlor games.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.887
You won't be telling anyone else
that Homer Simpson shot you.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.309
The scene of the crime.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.770
There must be something here
that can clear Dad.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
(cooing)
Clue, clue.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.066
That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon!

19:11.150 --> 19:14.027
I'd kiss you if you
weren't swimming with disease.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.615
(church bell tolls)

19:25.289 --> 19:27.749
(gasps)
So the DNA was right.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.711
It must have been...
Oh, Dad!

19:30.794 --> 19:32.754
<i>MAN: Attention all units:</i>
<i>Homer Simpson has been sighted.</i>

19:32.838 --> 19:34.923
<i>Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe</i>
<i>Memorial Hospital.</i>

19:35.007 --> 19:37.217
(gasping)

19:37.301 --> 19:38.468
(angry cries)

19:38.552 --> 19:40.262
Be careful when we capture him.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.555
We cannot claim the reward

19:41.638 --> 19:43.473
unless we have 51%
of the carcass.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.691
Stop!

19:52.774 --> 19:55.527
Don't shoot my dad!

19:55.611 --> 19:56.862
He's innocent.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.865
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.075
-Stop telling them it was me!
-Homer Simpson.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.952
I'll kill you
for saying it was me.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.704
Ho-mer Simp-son.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.165
BURNS: What is the
m-meaning of this?

20:08.248 --> 20:11.210
Smithers, who is this
beast that's shaking me?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.337
D'oh!

20:14.421 --> 20:15.923
Say it, Burns!

20:16.006 --> 20:18.425
Say I never shot you!

20:18.508 --> 20:19.426
Before...

20:19.509 --> 20:21.303
Shot? (chuckles)
By you?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.680
I'm afraid not,
my primitive friend.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.016
Your kind has neither
the cranial capacity

20:26.099 --> 20:28.560
nor the opposable digits
to operate a firearm.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.229
The one who shot me was...

20:32.231 --> 20:34.149
(yelling)

20:34.233 --> 20:35.859
M--Maggie Simpson!

20:38.195 --> 20:41.073
With the sunblocker in place
and the town aghast,

20:41.156 --> 20:43.116
I was on top of the world.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.160
<i>So, I wanted to kick</i>
<i>up my heels</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:46.787
<i>and indulge</i>
<i>my sweet tooth.</i>

20:46.870 --> 20:48.622
I feel like celebrating.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.086
Oh, it's you. What are you
so happy about?

20:54.169 --> 20:56.296
(gasps)
I see.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.758
Yes...

20:59.841 --> 21:01.009
(lips smacking)

21:01.093 --> 21:02.594
That's the one.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.429
Smithers had thwarted
my earlier attempt

21:04.513 --> 21:05.889
to take candy from a baby,

21:05.973 --> 21:08.100
but with him out
of the picture,

21:08.183 --> 21:10.227
I was free to wallow
in my own crapulence.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.312
I think you better drop it.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.147
<i>But the old axiom</i>
<i>was misleading;</i>

21:14.231 --> 21:16.775
<i>taking the candy proved</i>
<i>exceedingly difficult.</i>

21:16.858 --> 21:18.652
I said, drop it!

21:18.735 --> 21:20.946
(straining)

21:22.406 --> 21:24.950
(gunfire)

21:30.080 --> 21:32.833
<i>Stricken, I lurched forth</i>
<i>in search of aid</i>

21:32.916 --> 21:35.752
<i>but finding only</i>
<i>slack-jawed gawkers</i>

21:35.836 --> 21:37.921
<i>I gave up and collapsed</i>
<i>on the sundial.</i>

21:38.005 --> 21:40.424
Then with your last
ounce of strength

21:40.507 --> 21:43.510
you pointed
to "W" And "S"

21:43.593 --> 21:47.264
Or, from your point
of view, "M" And "S."

21:47.347 --> 21:48.807
Maggie Simpson.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.100
What?

21:50.183 --> 21:52.144
No, with my last ounce
of strength

21:52.227 --> 21:55.022
I sucked out my gold fillings
and swallowed them.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.190
Those paramedics
have sticky fingers.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.318
Well, I'm just relieved
that Homer's safe

21:59.401 --> 22:01.820
and that you've recovered,
and we can all get back to normal.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.405
If Maggie could talk

22:03.488 --> 22:04.865
I'm sure she'd apologize
for shooting you.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.242
I'm afraid
that's insufficient.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.202
Officer, arrest the baby.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.080
(laughing)
Yeah, right, Pops.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.250
No jury in the world's
gonna convict a baby.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.418
Hmm, maybe Texas.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.420
Besides, she didn't mean it.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.588
It was an accident.
