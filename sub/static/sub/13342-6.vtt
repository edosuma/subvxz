02:51.291 --> 02:53.375

Sue me.

That's so fucked up.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.792
Elijah, this is
my cereal, okay?

02:57.792 --> 02:59.959
You can't just
waltz into town

02:59.959 --> 03:02.083
and eat another
person's cereal.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.500
If what you want
is cereal,

( voice breaking )
go to the store and

03:07.583 --> 03:10.583

Man:
So we called it
Madame Tinsley's

03:48.291 --> 03:50.208
because we wanted something
a bit ostentatious

03:50.208 --> 03:52.166
to separate it
from other instant soups

03:52.166 --> 03:54.792
that are marketed
as a cheap meal fix
because our soup is made

03:54.792 --> 03:56.875
with the finest dehydrated
products available

03:56.875 --> 04:00.917
and I have
an ex-girlfriend
named Tinsley.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.708
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.291
Oh, uh, so, yeah,
no, if you, uh--

04:06.291 --> 04:07.458
I didn't know
you were done.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.625
If you want me
to market this,

04:08.625 --> 04:11.333
then I'm just gonna
tell you right now
that, um--

04:11.333 --> 04:14.125
I just--
I hate the name.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.250
Well, that is not
a good start.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.458
Mm.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.041
You know that there
are lots of people

04:20.041 --> 04:21.333
who are applying
for this job

04:21.333 --> 04:23.667
who have actually
had jobs before.

04:23.667 --> 04:24.917
Yeah, like me.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.500
Are you talking
about these four...

04:26.500 --> 04:28.583
- I mean, those four
were absolutely...
- ...activities?

04:28.583 --> 04:30.125
...actual jobs.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.583
- Jobs, Scott.
- Camp counselor?

04:31.583 --> 04:33.166
But, um, I mean,
I would call that a job.

04:33.166 --> 04:36.333
I don't know if you've
ever been a camp counselor,
but it is no easy feat.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.000
Teenagers do it,
for the most part, right?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.500
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm talking about,
like, an adult job.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.792
- So what is your--
- I mean, I don't know, Scott,
is this what you wanted to do?

04:43.792 --> 04:45.083
( scoffs )
Excuse me?

04:45.083 --> 04:47.083
Was this your dream?
Like, fancy Cup O' Noodles?

04:47.083 --> 04:48.875
Yes, this was my dream.
Owning my own company.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.041
And I started it
with my two best friends,
Jeremy and Simon.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.166
- That's great.
- This is exactly
what I wanted to do.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.542
You and Jeremy
and Simon were like,

04:54.542 --> 04:57.125
"I wanna make old rice
that smells like badussy"?

04:57.125 --> 04:58.792
What's "badussy"?

04:58.792 --> 05:01.000
Um, it's "butt, dick,
and pussy."

05:01.000 --> 05:02.458
Do you have some kind
of problem with me?

05:02.458 --> 05:03.959
- No.
- What's going on?
I don't understand.

05:03.959 --> 05:05.542
- I don't have a problem
with you, Scott.
- No?

05:05.542 --> 05:08.041
- No. Why would I have
a problem with you?
- I don't know.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.208
I am so happy for you
and Jeremy and Simon.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.125
- Thank you.
- Scott, Harvard alum
makes good--

05:13.125 --> 05:15.208
that is such
an exciting story.

05:15.208 --> 05:18.333
Do you mind
if I write about it
for "Holy Shit Magazine"?

05:18.333 --> 05:20.083
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

05:20.083 --> 05:23.708
Look, clearly you do not
want this job,

05:23.708 --> 05:26.959
and, um, obviously I'm not
gonna give it to you.

05:26.959 --> 05:31.625
But maybe you would
still like to go for
a drink sometime?

05:31.625 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, absolutely.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.125
Man: ...allocations
going to the drive-up

05:36.125 --> 05:38.875
book drop project,

05:38.875 --> 05:43.250
but get nothing
in terms of lighting.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.583
I reviewed
a public record...

05:46.583 --> 05:50.041
Hi. Raymond Ploshansky.
I have an appointment.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.875
Man:
...public library district.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.625
You're fourth
on the docket.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.250
That's a cute model,
honey.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.667
Oh, thank you.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.250
Where are we now
on the docket?

05:58.250 --> 06:02.458
Oh, we just started.
Look, you can take a seat.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.583
Okay.
Thank you.

06:03.583 --> 06:08.625
...petty cash account
and $113 in cash on hand.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.250
Board member:
Okay, all right,
look, Mr. Harding,

06:10.250 --> 06:11.333
can you just pull up
the minutes

06:11.333 --> 06:13.458
so we can confirm
these dollar amounts,
please?

06:13.458 --> 06:17.959
I'm just asking you
to buy a few more lamps

06:17.959 --> 06:21.542
so that I could see
the books I'm reading, hmm?

06:21.542 --> 06:23.291
Okay, all right,
I hear you, Mr. Gold,

06:23.291 --> 06:25.000
but would you
just allow us a moment

06:25.000 --> 06:27.458
to confirm the facts,
please?

06:27.458 --> 06:30.208
Oh, my God, Desi,
"Close Up" has almost

06:30.208 --> 06:32.917
like 100 downloads already.
This is crazy.

06:32.917 --> 06:35.208
I mean, this has
to mean something
to Marcos at the label.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.458
- Don't you think?
- Mm.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.041
I think it has to.
This is--

06:39.041 --> 06:41.417
I don't think
they really care about
100 random people, baby.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.959
Well, they're not random.
These are our fans.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.375
This is so exciting.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.667
I feel like indie music blogs
are where everything's
happening.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.959
Pleandra Mariner got started
on this exact site.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.125
Yummers.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.542
- ( both laughing )
- We already did it.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.291
( groans )

06:57.291 --> 06:59.000
What?

07:00.625 --> 07:02.166
Mm.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.834
- You know what?
- Mmm?

07:06.834 --> 07:08.750
We should open
our showcase with this song.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.375
Mm, we only get two songs
for the showcase.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.000
Yes, we get an opener
and a closer,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.250
and this should be
our opener.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.917
Yeah, I mean,
this is a great
fucking song.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.375
Thank you.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.333
But this is not
one of our top two.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.834
What do you
like better?

07:23.834 --> 07:26.333
"Rattlesnake Cowgirl,"
"Heart for Sale,"

07:26.333 --> 07:29.500
"Whoa, Wow, Wonderful,"
"Song for Marcus Garvey,"

07:29.500 --> 07:31.917
"Oaxaca Blues,"
"Kokopelli Shelly."

07:31.917 --> 07:33.458
I mean, that's top six
right there.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.708
Mm.
Yeah, I know.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.125
I just feel
like it's our chance
to show some range.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.542
- Okay, see, what I think
about the showcase...
- Yeah.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.375
- ...we put our
best foot forward.
- Agreed.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.667
And if half of our set
is a syrupy love song,

07:43.667 --> 07:45.375
that's a total mislead,
babe, you know?

07:45.375 --> 07:47.834
- But we sing love songs.
- Not really.

07:47.834 --> 07:52.375
We sing, like,
modern American folk
with an indie edge.

07:52.375 --> 07:55.959
I tell people that
we're like She & Him,
but with actual romance.

07:55.959 --> 07:59.041
But we're nothing
like She & Him.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.875
- We're not?
- Whoa.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.834
You're blowing
my mind right now.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.875
- Marnie, we are nothing like--
- I hope we're like She & Him.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.458
- My God.
- We are noth-- are you
kidding me right now?

08:07.458 --> 08:12.000
You're freaking me out.
We are nothing like
She & Him, okay?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.083
We are nothing
like that band.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.917
How can we have
completely different takes

08:16.917 --> 08:19.500
on the same band
that we are both in?
That is bizarre to me.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.250
I'm starting to wonder
if maybe you don't like
"Close Up"

08:21.250 --> 08:22.583
because I wrote it
instead of you.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.875
- No, I like the song.
- Could that be it?
Are you sure?

08:24.875 --> 08:26.750
- I loved this song.
- Okay.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.083
What do you mean
loved  this song?

08:28.083 --> 08:30.333
And then you told me
that you're writing
She & Him songs

08:30.333 --> 08:33.750
and now, like,
my whole-- I gotta do
a heavy rethink here.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.707
How about we talk
about the partnership
that I thought we were in...

08:36.707 --> 08:38.707
- We are in a partnership.
- ...whereas recently--
no, recently

08:38.707 --> 08:41.417
it's just been me writing
while you tinker with
your motorcycle.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.417
I am-- that's my--
that's my mode of
transportation, Marnie.

08:43.417 --> 08:46.250
- That is my mode
of transportation.
- That doesn't change anything.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.834
That's how I get--

08:47.834 --> 08:49.208
That's weak, dude.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.125
That's my mode
of transportation.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.834
If she's feeling sick,
then I got nowhere to go.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.750
I do write.
I fucking write
all the time.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.333
I'm writing when
I'm doing anything.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.458
- When we're making love,
I'm writing.
- ( sighs )

09:00.458 --> 09:02.500
I am so glad that
we combined our books.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.333
You know, I was
a little nervous about it,

09:04.333 --> 09:06.917
but these children's
encyclopedias are amazing.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.583
They still say that Columbus
discovered America,

09:09.583 --> 09:12.542
and I think-- I think
in one of these illustrations,

09:12.542 --> 09:14.166
he's wearing makeup.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.500
Do you want to go
for a run in a sec?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.291
Um, no, thank you.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.625
Come on,
there's a street fair
I want to disrupt.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.250
Mm, I don't really
feel up to it.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.250
Beginnings of a cold?

09:27.250 --> 09:29.959
Gotta sweat that out.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.208
Come on.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.208
I like to watch you bounce.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.792
I like to watch
your boobs bounce.

09:36.792 --> 09:38.708
I like to watch
your ponytail bounce.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.375
I like to watch
your body bounce.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.917
No, I can't
go for a run

09:42.917 --> 09:44.959
'cause I had
an abortion yesterday.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.166
I can't go for a run
and I can't take a bath

09:49.166 --> 09:51.792
or use a tampon
or have intercourse
for, like, a week.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.166
( laughs )

09:58.333 --> 10:01.166
Are you, uh...

10:01.166 --> 10:02.458
what?

10:02.458 --> 10:04.417
Yeah, just a couple
of things I can't do

10:04.417 --> 10:07.959
'cause I had
an abortion yesterday.

10:07.959 --> 10:10.834
- Was it mine?
- Yeah, of course
it was yours.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.333
I didn't want to talk
about it beforehand.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.917
I just wanted to do it.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.834
But I haven't shared
with boyfriends in the past.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.792
I'm trying to be
more open with you.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.750
So you're trying
to be open with me?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.542
How many abortions
have you had?

10:28.542 --> 10:32.041
I'm not gonna share that
with you because that
is private.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.792
I'm not gonna ask you
how many girls you've
gotten pregnant.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.834
None.
It's not private.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.875
I've gotten no girls pregnant
except for you now.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.792
I think you're behaving
very magnanimously this time.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.208
I really do.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.542
And I think
it's very difficult
considering Mimi-Rose

10:57.542 --> 11:00.458
is a very fascinating,
very interesting, slim,

11:00.458 --> 11:02.375
kind of like
a little pinched nose there.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.625
How do you know that she's slim
with a little pinched nose?

11:05.625 --> 11:06.792
I never said that.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.583
Did you, like,
Google her or something?

11:08.583 --> 11:10.834
No, no, no.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.583
You just created
a very vivid image.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.917
I see her
as a very attractive,

11:14.917 --> 11:17.834
wondrous kind of
very angular, slim person.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.125
And I think you're being
very stable

11:20.125 --> 11:23.083
about this whole thing
and very mature.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.125
Thank you.
I guess the upside

11:25.125 --> 11:26.917
to having everything
go wrong in your life

11:26.917 --> 11:30.417
is that you cease to have
any expectations of anything
or anybody.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.250
And that's an unbelievably
mature thing

11:32.250 --> 11:33.834
for a person your age
to say.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.083
It's just great.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.917
I guess the thing
that's bothering me
the most

11:36.917 --> 11:39.083
is that I have no idea
what's coming next.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.708
- Mm.
- I've never felt
that way before.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.917
Like, I don't even know
what I want  to have happen.

11:42.917 --> 11:46.583
Well, when you were writing
as a career option,
how was that?

11:46.583 --> 11:48.417
Was it fulfilling?

11:48.417 --> 11:49.875
Fulfilling?
I don't know.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.792
I remarkably
never thought about that.

11:52.792 --> 11:57.834
I mean, I guess I liked
the fact that writing

11:57.834 --> 12:01.625
has the ability
to effect change.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.291
You know?
The writers who I love

12:03.291 --> 12:04.917
really helped me
to form my world view,

12:04.917 --> 12:07.959
so, I don't know,
I guess I wanted to help
other people

12:07.959 --> 12:09.500
the way those writers
have helped me.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.458
You're a helper.
You're just-- you know,

12:11.458 --> 12:13.208
you like helping people,
I think.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.500
With Iowa, getting in,
really what I liked

12:15.500 --> 12:17.041
was just that my friends
seemed really impressed

12:17.041 --> 12:18.250
and my mom
seemed really happy.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.959
Well, you made your mom happy.
That made you feel good.

12:20.959 --> 12:25.041
So sometimes making
your mom happy is helping
your mom.

12:25.041 --> 12:28.333
So maybe I do  really like
helping people.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.625
Wow.
I mean, who--
who are you?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.625
Who is this person
that I'm seeing sitting there

12:33.625 --> 12:37.959
saying these beautiful,
stable things over there?

12:37.959 --> 12:41.625
I just-- this is like
a wow moment for me.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.375
Wow.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.500
Who fucking went with you?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.959
My friend
Sue-Ellen Garth.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.333
I don't even know her.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.667
You'll meet her.
She's a somnambulist.

12:50.667 --> 12:54.000
Who-- who-- who did it?
Who aborted you?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.166
A doctor named Guneta
did the procedure.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.166
She delivered
my cousin's baby.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.166
- Was it a boy or a girl?
- My cousin's baby's a girl.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.834
No! Ours!

13:06.542 --> 13:07.792
It was a ball of cells.

13:07.792 --> 13:09.750
It was smaller
than a seed pearl.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.125
It didn't have
a penis or a vagina.

13:11.125 --> 13:14.959
Isn't this a decision
that people typically
make together?

13:14.959 --> 13:17.417
- So you wanted a baby?
- Maybe.

13:17.417 --> 13:18.542
That's kind of absurd.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.417
We've been together
for less than seven weeks.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.041
I don't think that
we're ready for a child.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.750
Crazier things have happened.
People do crazy things.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.250
My parents got married
after a fucking week.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.250
Okay, so we should
have the baby

13:29.250 --> 13:32.000
and put it
in your toolbox
as a cradle

13:32.000 --> 13:35.083
and feed it sardines
and tell it that you
don't know my middle name?

13:35.083 --> 13:38.000
- It's Rose!
- No, my first name
is Mimi-Rose.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.250
My middle name
is Eleanor.

13:39.250 --> 13:42.542
I don't understand
how you could do
something like that

13:42.542 --> 13:45.500
without talking
to me first.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.208
It's-- that's evil.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.375
You're right,
you don't understand.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.375
( door closes )

14:03.708 --> 14:06.583
I had just gone as far
as I could go in Iowa,
you know?

14:06.583 --> 14:08.000
- Yeah.
- I was practically
running that JCPenney.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.875
I was dating a guy
who was the front-runner
in the mayoral race.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.208
I had just put a bid in
on 16 acres,

14:13.208 --> 14:16.417
but I thought, I don't know,
I just feel empty.

14:16.417 --> 14:19.041
So I might as well
come back here and
be with you losers.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.291
I've decided
I'm not getting a job.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.875
I'm gonna marry Scott
the soup mogul,

14:23.875 --> 14:26.458
and I'm just gonna
be Mrs. Madame Tinsley
for the rest of my life.

14:26.458 --> 14:30.291
I'm gonna forgo
all of my dreams
and ambitions for his,

14:30.291 --> 14:31.708
and I'm just gonna
become my mother.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.792
No, no, no, you do not
wanna end up with someone
so selfish.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.250
I'm telling you,
Shosh, seriously,

14:35.250 --> 14:37.625
you end up
feeling more alone
than you felt

14:37.625 --> 14:39.500
when you were actually
just entirely alone.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.917
Marnie, you fought
so hard for this
relationship,

14:41.917 --> 14:43.625
- but it's making you
unhappy already?
- I know.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.333
I don't know
what the fuck
is wrong with me.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.959
I think I'm incapable
of true companionship.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.083
Plus,
he's a total asshole
as it turns out.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.083
Oh, my God, this table
is like the island
of misfit animals.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.166
I'm falling asleep
right now.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.792
I could be at a brunch
with a guy

14:54.792 --> 14:57.291
who runs a microbrewery,
so let's pep it up.

14:57.291 --> 14:59.667
Well, listen,
I have big news,

14:59.667 --> 15:02.333
which is that I've decided
to get a job that actually
helps people.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.166
Ew, like
a not-for-profit job?

15:04.166 --> 15:06.125
Hannah, you're the most
selfish person we know.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.834
I mean, you won't
even share a Kit Kat.

15:07.834 --> 15:10.208
Yeah, it's true.
You're so selfish that
when we lived together,

15:10.208 --> 15:12.250
you put
the fire extinguisher
in your own bedroom

15:12.250 --> 15:13.917
so you could have
access to it first.

15:13.917 --> 15:16.166
Well, that's all gonna
be turned on its head

15:16.166 --> 15:18.458
'cause you know what?
I wanna change the world.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.333
- Change the world?
- Like, all of it?

15:20.333 --> 15:23.458
- That's a big job.
- Why is this so flummoxing
to all of you,

15:23.458 --> 15:24.875
me wanting to make
a positive change?

15:24.875 --> 15:28.542
Because I'm very skeptical
of anyone who wants
to help others.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.750
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, there's always
some sort of hidden agenda.

15:30.750 --> 15:34.000
100%.
Mother Teresa
loved being famous.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.667
Well, what's a job
that I could have

15:35.667 --> 15:37.542
that helps people
that doesn't disgust you?

15:37.542 --> 15:40.875
- Um...
- Elijah: Based on
this look, I would say...

15:40.875 --> 15:43.667
- bus and truck with
"Thoroughly Modern Millie"...
- Jessa: Yes.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.708
Ice Capades...

15:44.708 --> 15:47.208
- Clock maker.
- Uh, clog model?

15:47.208 --> 15:49.000
- Schoolmarm.
- Okay.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.875
- Tennille in a Captain
& Tennille cover band.
- Shoshanna: Yeah.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.458
- Girl who gets killed
in a Lifetime movie.
- Wait.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.083
Mayim Bialik's
stunt double.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.625
Elijah.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.708
Your horrid,
horrid personality

16:00.708 --> 16:02.375
may have actually led
to something good,

16:02.375 --> 16:06.000
which is that
I could be a teacher.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.208
Well, you know what they say--
those who can't do, teach.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.708
Yes, and I can't do,
so I'm gonna teach.

16:12.708 --> 16:15.417
Woman:
All three
vacant properties

16:15.417 --> 16:19.041
are owned by
a Mr. Anat Heifetz,

16:19.041 --> 16:22.333
who has yet to incur
any monetary fines

16:22.333 --> 16:27.000
associated with buildings
standing longer than 30 days

16:27.000 --> 16:29.208
without registering
with the city.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.375
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, but I gotta
run out of here early tonight.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.875
Can-- a motion to adjourn
and we'll pick up where
we leave off next week.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.708
- Board member #2: Second.
- With that second,
I adjourn this session.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.458
We'll continue next week
starting with--

16:40.458 --> 16:42.458
- Woman: Kippy Cohen.
- Ted: Kippy Cohen.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.875
- Good?
- ( gavel bangs )

16:43.875 --> 16:46.291
- Done.
- Objection!

16:46.291 --> 16:48.000
I'm sorry?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.458
- Ray: I object.
- Ted: What?

16:50.458 --> 16:55.708
I've been sitting patiently,
quietly in this chair all day.

16:55.708 --> 16:57.291
All day.
You wanna know why?

16:57.291 --> 16:59.458
'Cause I'm
on today's docket.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.667
Today's docket
should happen today.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.708
Next week is
for next week's docket.

17:03.708 --> 17:06.250
Well, thank you
for contributing
your opinion,

17:06.250 --> 17:08.625
but sometimes we don't
get through it all, okay?

17:08.625 --> 17:11.250
Like, today we started
with some issues
from last week.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.916
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
but I don't think
that's very fair.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.125
And I don't think
they do either.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.834
And it's certainly no way
to manage your business.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.541
So I would like
to procure a motion

17:19.541 --> 17:21.375
that we get through
today's docket today.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.834
- I second that.
- Thank you, Kippy.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.834
Okay, well, a motion
has to be seconded by
a member of the board.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.290
Are there
any board members

17:28.290 --> 17:30.792
that wants to second
this hothead's motion?

17:30.792 --> 17:33.000
I didn't think so.
Good night.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.417
Will you hold that, please?
Thank you.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.792
Excuse me, Kippy.

17:35.792 --> 17:38.458
You all should be ashamed
of yourselves.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.291
Shame on you!

17:40.291 --> 17:42.083
You call this politics?

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
This is a circus!

17:43.500 --> 17:45.667
Okay, thank you.
Can you sit down now, please?

17:45.667 --> 17:49.000
You can't even put
a few lights in the library
so Mr. Gold can read?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.625
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:51.625 --> 17:52.834
I take umbrage!

17:52.834 --> 17:53.959
Hold on, umbrage?

17:53.959 --> 17:55.917
I just wanna write that down,
that you take umbrage.

17:55.917 --> 18:00.291
I take umbrage
at your sweeping disregard
for the taxpayer

18:00.291 --> 18:03.166
and your general
managerial ineptitude.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.166
Umbrage!
Shame on you people!

18:06.166 --> 18:09.125
- ( sighs )
- He's not wrong.

18:09.125 --> 18:12.625
I can't remember
the last time we got
something approved here.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.834
Seriously, Stu,
you can't remember?
You can't remember--

18:14.834 --> 18:17.041
so all of a sudden,
you have a problem with
our productivity?

18:17.041 --> 18:19.542
- Stu: Yeah.
- When was the last session
you came to not drunk?

18:19.542 --> 18:23.166
Says the man who'd
probably stop at a bar
and cheat on his wife.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.959
You're gonna judge me?
How dare you?

18:24.959 --> 18:27.500
Why don't you go visit
your convict husband
in jail?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.875
Oh, nice, Ted.
Professional as always.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.792
And do you wanna tell
everyone how much money

18:31.792 --> 18:33.542
you took from funds
in petty cash last month?

18:33.542 --> 18:35.875
Screw you, creep.
I thought you were my friend.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.500
Board member #3:
Not when it comes to money.

18:37.500 --> 18:41.000
- Board member #4:
You put that money back!
- Ted: I took a loan of $10.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.166
( overlapping arguing )

19:36.083 --> 19:39.208
You know how I always sleep
15 minutes later than you?

19:39.208 --> 19:41.834
I really wake up
before you.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.792
But I pretend
to be totally asleep
because I love it

19:44.792 --> 19:48.583
when you tuck me in
and you kiss me.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.792
I'm really coming
to depend on that.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.917
Why didn't you talk
to me about it?

19:55.917 --> 19:57.792
'Cause I knew
what I wanted to do.

19:57.792 --> 20:01.166
Why didn't you want me
to come with you?

20:01.166 --> 20:03.000
I mean, don't you
need me at all?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.041
'Cause it freaks me out.

20:04.041 --> 20:05.625
You never tell me
what you're working on.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.750
You don't mind
if I don't make it
to whatever fucking party.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.333
You don't ask me
how you look or whatever.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.917
You just look
in the mirror and go.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.959
You're like those jellyfish
who only need to fuck once

20:12.959 --> 20:14.250
to have generations
of kids.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.959
Sometimes I just can't tell
what I'm even here for at all.

20:16.959 --> 20:19.041
See, that's what
I love about you.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.291
You know
the weirdest stuff.

20:21.291 --> 20:25.208
Your brain does not process
information in a normal way
at all.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.834
Truly, Adam, I care
about you so much.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.792
( groans )

20:29.792 --> 20:33.291
I care about my butcher.
I need my butcher.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.959
I can't butcher meats.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.041
I need my butcher
more than you need me.

20:37.041 --> 20:40.250
No, I don't need you.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.250
But I love coming home
and knowing you're
behind the door.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.875
And I love watching you
bend down and pick
something up

20:45.875 --> 20:49.458
'cause you use your body
in a really strange way.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.083
And wanting you like this,

20:51.083 --> 20:54.041
that's better
than needing you
because it's pure.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.166
I feel like
you lied to me.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.083
No, I didn't lie to you.

20:58.083 --> 21:02.333
I just waited to share
information until it was
too late for you to chime in.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.583
( scoffs )

21:04.583 --> 21:07.750
It's funny,
I felt so good
about you moving in.

21:07.750 --> 21:08.834
( soft laugh )

21:08.834 --> 21:11.333
Just this morning,
I loved looking
at your books

21:11.333 --> 21:14.834
and learning their names
like I know mine.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.500
I guess...

21:18.166 --> 21:19.625
I don't know.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.792
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I like that, too.
