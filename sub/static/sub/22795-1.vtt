04:55.583 --> 04:58.000
What a way
to end the week.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.583
I swear to God,
if I had to spend one more day

05:00.583 --> 05:03.208
pushing stuff around my desk
pretending to look busy,

05:03.208 --> 05:06.041
I would've actually
had to break down

05:06.041 --> 05:09.041
and do some real work.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.500
Oh, come on.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.875
Pushing stuff around
is really work.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.542
I wish Harris
would let me have a job.

05:16.542 --> 05:19.708
It's against his high standards
for trophy wives.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.542
Lucky you.

05:21.542 --> 05:22.917
I wish I could
land a guy

05:22.917 --> 05:25.041
that just wanted
a pampered trophy wife.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.750
I'd be perfect.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.750
Maybe,

05:28.750 --> 05:31.041
but you'd
also get bored...

05:31.041 --> 05:33.041
really bored.

05:33.041 --> 05:37.041
There's no one to talk to
in that big house.

05:37.041 --> 05:39.792
Nothing to do
but look pretty for no one.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.792
Come on, Katy,

05:41.792 --> 05:44.625
you're married,
you have a husband,

05:44.625 --> 05:47.458
he's good looking
and rich.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.583
I never see him.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.375
Harris didn't get rich
by hanging around the house.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.083
Harris Fletcher,

05:56.083 --> 05:58.250
king of Fletcher Chemicals.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.458
To Katy...

06:01.458 --> 06:02.917
queen of chemicals.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.458
I just wish he would pin me down
to the mattress

06:10.458 --> 06:12.458
a little more,
you know?

06:12.458 --> 06:15.375
We haven't had sex
in over a month.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.041
No?

06:17.041 --> 06:18.917
You're kidding me?

06:18.917 --> 06:20.750
It's like
I don't even exist.

06:20.750 --> 06:24.125
But do you think he's getting it from
somewhere else?

06:24.125 --> 06:25.667
I hope not.

06:25.667 --> 06:29.250
But I kinda wish I was.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.125
When does King Harris

06:32.125 --> 06:34.125
get back from
his little trip?

06:34.125 --> 06:36.417
Tomorrow, noon.

06:36.417 --> 06:37.625
Great.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.834
So we have all night.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.125
And you

06:41.125 --> 06:43.959
without your wedding ring.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.375
Come on, it's too expensive
to wear out on the town.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.291
Uh-huh, sure.

06:50.291 --> 06:51.792
Oh, um, what's this.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.792
It's from that gentleman
at the end of the bar.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.125
Ooh, you have an admirer.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.834
We should just ignore him.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.834
Are you kidding me?

07:02.834 --> 07:04.917
Slide your pretty little butt
down there

07:04.917 --> 07:07.959
- and introduce yourself.
- What?

07:07.959 --> 07:09.375
No, I... I shouldn't.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.542
I...

07:11.875 --> 07:13.875
What would I say?

07:13.875 --> 07:17.166
Um, how about
a thank you.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.333
Okay.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.208
Thank you for the drink.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.500
- I'm Katy.
- I'm Mark.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.000
Sorry about being so forward,
but I couldn't take the chance

07:36.000 --> 07:37.458
of you two leaving

07:37.458 --> 07:39.000
without giving me
an opportunity

07:39.000 --> 07:40.708
to introduce myself first.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.041
I don't normally
accept drinks from strangers.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.834
But we're not
strangers anymore.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.625
That's right.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.667
So, Mark,

07:53.667 --> 07:56.667
- why me?
- I don't know.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.041
Your obviously elegance,

07:59.041 --> 08:02.208
your sophisticated demeanor,

08:02.208 --> 08:03.542
and you're beautiful.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.667
Flattery comes easily
in situations like this.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.625
I just stopped in
on my way home.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.708
All my Friday plans
got cancelled.

08:13.708 --> 08:16.708
Oh, that's too bad.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.542
I just came here
to unwind a little.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.417
Wanna get out of here?

08:23.417 --> 08:26.250
Just like that?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.792
Um, I...

08:28.792 --> 08:31.041
I shouldn't.
Um...

08:33.582 --> 08:34.792
Wait here.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.291
How's it going?

08:39.291 --> 08:40.792
He wants me
to go home with him.

08:40.792 --> 08:44.417
Uh, and you
without your wedding ring.

08:44.417 --> 08:47.166
Okay, you better
call me tomorrow.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.583
You got it.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.708
Let's go.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.583
Here you go.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.583
House specialty.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.750
Thank you.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.291
I gotta tell you,
I don't normally do this.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.667
You coulda said no.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.083
I could have,

09:09.083 --> 09:12.750
and I should have but...

09:12.750 --> 09:14.250
I didn't want to.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.875
Hmm. Brandy?

09:18.875 --> 09:22.125
- Surprised?
- Maybe.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.917
It's my favorite vice.

09:23.917 --> 09:27.792
It's dark, fragrant,

09:27.792 --> 09:29.583
and it never disappoints.

09:35.834 --> 09:39.041
Are you talking
about the brandy?

09:39.041 --> 09:41.083
We'll see.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.291
You move pretty fast.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.166
When I see something
I really want,

09:45.166 --> 09:46.667
I don't hold back.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.500
I give everything.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.208
I guess I look at life
the same way.

09:53.166 --> 09:57.000
I kind of admire
that kind of passion in a person.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.834
I like that kind of heat.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.542
I just keep asking myself,
what am I doing here?

10:06.125 --> 10:07.708
You can leave if you want.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.166
And go back to what?

10:10.166 --> 10:13.542
A big empty house?
A big empty bed?

10:13.542 --> 10:15.250
No.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.583
Tonight, I decided...

10:17.583 --> 10:20.208
will be my night,

10:20.208 --> 10:23.000
that I would call
the shots.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.166
Tonight's gonna be
all about me.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.792
You strike me as rather

10:27.792 --> 10:31.542
sad and lonely.

10:31.542 --> 10:34.000
I'd like to change that
if I could.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.667
So what then, Katy,

10:37.667 --> 10:39.750
would you like
to do tonight?

10:41.542 --> 10:43.917
You know, it's funny.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.750
No one's ever
asked me that before.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.166
I think...

10:49.166 --> 10:52.208
that I would like
to make love to you

10:52.208 --> 10:54.208
until every
last bit of energy

10:54.208 --> 10:56.208
has been drained
from our bodies.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.417
I love a challenge.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.708
Don't hold back, okay?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.625
Give me everything.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.083
I already told you.

11:13.375 --> 11:16.125
When I see something
I really want.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.500
Katy?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.083
Katy, you home?

18:11.083 --> 18:13.333
Hello, darling.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.750
Did you just get home?

18:14.750 --> 18:16.291
Yeah, yeah,
but I'm in a hurry.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.875
I'm sorry if I woke you.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.166
I didn't know that you were
sleeping in today.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.542
Oh, no, it's okay.

18:20.542 --> 18:23.667
I was up late watching TV.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.917
Hmm, what was it this time?

18:25.917 --> 18:27.333
Hmm?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.000
What were you watching on TV?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.375
Oh, uh, something old.
"Love Story," I think.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.041
So, um,

18:35.041 --> 18:37.500
I'm already half undressed
if you wanna...?

18:37.500 --> 18:40.375
Oh, I wish.
I wish but I have a lot to do.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.166
- How 'bout just a quickie?
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.125
I, um, just came home
to grab a few things.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.667
I have another plane
to catch.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.917
You what?
You have a plane to catch?

18:49.917 --> 18:51.917
You... wow?
You just walked through the front door.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.375
I know, I know,
but I'm sorry,

18:53.375 --> 18:54.750
but things
on this Wednesday deal

18:54.750 --> 18:56.250
are really starting
to heat up

18:56.250 --> 18:59.333
and I can't let them
cool down or I'm sunk.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.375
So you're leaving again?
Right now?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.041
Just as soon as I grab
some papers that I need.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.166
Unbelievable.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.917
Don't you want me anymore?

19:30.250 --> 19:32.000
Of course I do.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.625
I just can't stop
everything right now to have sex.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.041
I'm not asking you
to stop everything.

19:39.792 --> 19:42.291
You know what I mean.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.917
Look...

19:43.917 --> 19:46.917
when I get back
and things slow down,

19:46.917 --> 19:48.250
I'll take you to Vegas.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.250
Promise?

19:52.250 --> 19:53.458
I promise.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.583
But I have to run.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.917
Be safe.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.792
What's wrong with me?

20:28.500 --> 20:31.500
Who wouldn't want...

20:31.500 --> 20:33.500
this?

24:48.333 --> 24:51.041
Um... just a minute!

24:52.375 --> 24:53.708
Fuck.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.333
I'm coming.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.750
Coming.

25:03.250 --> 25:06.625
Good morning, Mrs. Fletcher,
is Harris home?

25:06.625 --> 25:09.875
Um, no,
you just missed him.

25:09.875 --> 25:12.625
Oh, I thought I could catch him
before he left.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.875
No, he was in a hurry.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.959
In fact,
he couldn't wait to leave.

25:16.959 --> 25:19.583
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:19.583 --> 25:21.458
- Mrs. Fletcher...
- Call me Katy.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.583
Missus makes me sound so old.

25:23.583 --> 25:26.041
All right, Katy,

25:26.041 --> 25:27.834
and you're anything but old.

25:27.834 --> 25:31.208
In fact, I think you're
absolutely beautiful.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.458
Thank you.
Is that for Harris?

25:33.458 --> 25:36.708
It was,
but I guess I'm too late.

25:44.291 --> 25:45.917
You can give it to me
if you want.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.625
I'll make sure
that he gets it.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.291
Sure, Katy,
if you really want to.

25:50.291 --> 25:53.083
In fact,
I think you should have a peek inside.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.500
It couldn't hurt.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.583
Why are you being
so mysterious, Jan?

25:56.583 --> 25:58.792
No mystery.

25:58.792 --> 26:01.750
I think
it's about to become crystal clear.

26:07.083 --> 26:10.083
- My God.
- My thoughts exactly.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.125
I couldn't imagine
what Harris would say

26:11.125 --> 26:12.583
if he were to see them.

26:12.583 --> 26:15.834
You can't.
You wouldn't.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.667
I could and I am.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.959
You see, I work for Harris
and the Fletcher Company.

26:20.959 --> 26:22.667
My loyalties lie with him.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
I like this one.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.500
You're good in bed, Katy,
or so I've heard.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.375
What the hell
is this about?

26:33.375 --> 26:35.667
This is about money, Katy,

26:35.667 --> 26:38.417
your money.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.750
I can't believe this.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.542
You're actually
blackmailing me?

26:42.542 --> 26:46.542
Ooh, I don't like the word
blackmail, Katy.

26:46.542 --> 26:49.333
I prefer to think
of this as a

26:49.333 --> 26:51.542
marital insurance policy...

26:51.542 --> 26:54.375
one that insures
your cooperation.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.166
What do you want?

27:02.083 --> 27:04.667
I think $6,000
would be a bargain

27:04.667 --> 27:07.166
to keep your marriage
with Harris in good standing.

27:07.166 --> 27:09.375
Pretty sure you have
a prenup that would kick in

27:09.375 --> 27:11.166
if word of your
little affair

27:11.166 --> 27:13.250
were to ever get out.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.000
I can't get
that kind of money

27:15.000 --> 27:17.708
- without Harris knowing.
- Sure you can.

27:17.708 --> 27:21.417
I'm sure you have some jewelry around here
that you could sell.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.250
Actually,

27:23.250 --> 27:25.291
you can sell it
to this guy.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.417
After, say that
it was stolen,

27:27.417 --> 27:30.041
your insurance might even
give you money for it,

27:30.041 --> 27:32.166
and we'll be all
squared away.

27:32.166 --> 27:35.708
Do we understand
each other?

27:35.708 --> 27:39.333
I said,
"Do we understand each other?"

27:40.708 --> 27:45.125
It'll take me
a while but...

27:45.125 --> 27:46.375
I understand.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.166
Good.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.708
What're you doing?

27:53.708 --> 27:56.083
Think of this
as a down payment

27:56.083 --> 27:58.083
to insure your secrecy

27:58.083 --> 28:00.917
and hold me over
until we meet again.

28:00.917 --> 28:03.583
- You mean...?
- Well, let's face it,

28:03.583 --> 28:06.417
I can only tell so much
from these photos.

28:06.417 --> 28:09.041
I wanna see you
up close and personal.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.875
How can you say no?

28:12.875 --> 28:14.250
I can't.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.458
Good, then you
might as well enjoy it.

28:16.458 --> 28:19.291
I'm known
to be pretty good in bed myself.

35:07.166 --> 35:10.166
So how'd it go?

35:10.166 --> 35:13.333
I don't think
we have anything to worry about.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.000
She'll do exactly
what I tell her to.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.375
You sure?

35:17.375 --> 35:19.583
She's done everything
I've asked so far.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.875
And more.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.291
I think
she'll follow through.

35:22.291 --> 35:24.500
- She has a lot to lose.
- Good,

35:24.500 --> 35:26.917
but we have to be
very careful with her.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.375
We don't want to push
too hard.

35:28.375 --> 35:30.041
We can't afford
to let this one get away.

35:30.041 --> 35:32.083
Don't worry,
she's hooked.

35:34.041 --> 35:36.041
Maybe.

35:36.041 --> 35:38.166
Just be careful.

35:40.875 --> 35:42.583
Pity.
She was worth a bundle.

35:42.583 --> 35:47.041
I... I didn't think
she would take this way out.

35:47.041 --> 35:49.708
Do you think they could
tie anything to us?

35:49.708 --> 35:52.250
You mean,
tie anything to you, don't you?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.375
No, I don't think so.

35:54.375 --> 35:57.083
- How can you be so sure?
- Easy.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.542
I made sure
your pretty little face

35:59.542 --> 36:01.542
didn't appear
in any of the photos.

36:01.542 --> 36:04.208
No one will ever know
who that other girl was...

36:04.208 --> 36:06.333
except you and me,
of course.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.083
This takes everything
to a whole new level.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.417
Not at all.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.625
She was unstable,
unpredictable.

36:12.625 --> 36:14.708
- It's not our fault.
- Sure,

36:14.708 --> 36:18.125
but she was a major client
of Fletcher's Chemicals.

36:18.125 --> 36:19.750
I mean,
what if she told someone?

36:19.750 --> 36:22.208
What if she left a note?

36:22.208 --> 36:24.041
I just don't think
it's smart that we continue

36:24.041 --> 36:26.875
targeting people
through my job.

36:26.875 --> 36:29.708
Don't be silly.
It's perfect.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.583
Besides, the paper didn't
mention anything about a note.

36:34.583 --> 36:38.291
I think she just decided
to hide her shame permanently.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.125
Now it's over.

36:40.125 --> 36:41.583
Time to move on.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.083
So...

36:47.083 --> 36:49.583
did you enjoy watching me
make love to her?

36:49.583 --> 36:52.041
Watching her
go down on me?

36:52.041 --> 36:54.667
Not as much as
you seemed to.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.417
It's just business, Jan.

36:56.417 --> 36:58.458
Try to remember that.

36:58.458 --> 37:01.583
And that's all it is,
just business.

37:01.583 --> 37:03.458
Oh, yeah?
Then, um,

37:03.458 --> 37:05.959
why are you getting so hard
just talking about it?

37:05.959 --> 37:09.166
'Cause I know know
how wicked you really are.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.583
It wasn't
just business for you.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.625
You really wanted her.

37:12.625 --> 37:15.625
- You really took her.
- Yeah.

37:15.625 --> 37:18.417
Just like
I'm gonna take you...

37:18.417 --> 37:20.291
right now.

44:13.375 --> 44:15.875
Hello?
Is this Adam?

44:17.041 --> 44:18.708
I need to see you.

44:18.708 --> 44:20.708
I have something
I'd like to sell.

44:45.959 --> 44:48.208
You're Adam?

44:48.208 --> 44:49.917
I am.

44:49.917 --> 44:52.250
- Are you Katy?
- Yes.

44:53.959 --> 44:57.625
- I, um...
- Hey, don't be scared, Katy.

44:57.625 --> 45:00.250
I won't bite you.

45:00.250 --> 45:01.792
I'm here to help...

45:01.792 --> 45:03.041
if I can.

45:03.041 --> 45:05.500
I'm not so sure about that.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.291
Look, honey,
I'm here, I'm available,

45:09.291 --> 45:13.250
and I have cash...

45:13.250 --> 45:16.250
and I don't ask
too many questions.

45:16.250 --> 45:18.792
Now let me see
what you've got.

45:32.834 --> 45:34.458
Nice.

45:36.625 --> 45:38.291
Very nice.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.417
Somebody must love you a lot.

45:42.417 --> 45:45.333
Don't bet on it.

45:45.333 --> 45:48.583
Okay, let's just say,

45:48.583 --> 45:51.792
somebody paid dearly
to have you,

45:51.792 --> 45:53.834
and now you're in
some kind of a spot.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.834
Is that one?

45:57.333 --> 45:58.959
Do you tell fortunes, too?

45:58.959 --> 46:00.417
You wanna sell it or not?

46:00.417 --> 46:02.333
I want to sell it.

46:04.041 --> 46:06.000
I can give you $5,000.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.333
But it's worth ten.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.667
No, to me it isn't.

46:10.667 --> 46:13.458
5,000 is the best
I can do.

46:15.291 --> 46:18.625
I really need 6,000.

46:20.834 --> 46:24.000
No can do.
Five.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.792
Take it or leave it.

46:29.041 --> 46:31.333
Okay, fine,
I'll take it.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.125
Great.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.333
Come in the back.
I'll get you your money.

46:46.708 --> 46:49.917
There you go.
$5,000.

46:52.166 --> 46:54.000
You have
a lot more money in that bag.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.208
Yeah, but I'm not crazy enough
to spend more money

46:57.208 --> 46:58.667
if I really don't have to.

47:00.708 --> 47:03.083
I really need 6,000.

47:06.208 --> 47:07.375
I feel for you, Katy,

47:07.375 --> 47:09.875
I really do,

47:09.875 --> 47:11.542
but I'm a business man.

47:13.083 --> 47:14.208
Please?

47:18.208 --> 47:19.417
Okay.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.250
- Take off your top.
- What?

47:25.250 --> 47:27.458
I said,
"Take off your top."

47:27.458 --> 47:30.875
If I like what I see

47:30.875 --> 47:33.834
and you want
to treat me real nice,

47:33.834 --> 47:37.250
- I'll spot you $1,000.
- You can't be serious?

47:38.542 --> 47:39.875
I'm not a prostitute.

47:39.875 --> 47:41.708
Of course you are not.

47:41.708 --> 47:44.708
Now, come on, Katy,

47:44.708 --> 47:46.291
I don't have all day.

48:08.166 --> 48:11.417
Hmm, even nicer
than your diamond necklace.

48:27.625 --> 48:30.000
Now...

48:30.000 --> 48:32.458
we'll see how nice
you can be.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.792
I got your message.
You work fast.

56:27.458 --> 56:29.333
So do you.

56:29.333 --> 56:32.917
Does my husband
know what kind of game you're playing?

56:32.917 --> 56:34.917
No, of course not.

56:34.917 --> 56:36.291
He's never around
long enough

56:36.291 --> 56:39.125
to suspect
anyone of anything,

56:39.125 --> 56:41.792
but you probably know that
better than me.

56:49.291 --> 56:51.041
I suspect
I'm not the first person

56:51.041 --> 56:54.125
- you've done this to.
- Let's not talk shop, Katy.

56:54.125 --> 56:56.458
$6,000.

56:56.458 --> 56:57.875
Do you want to count it?

56:57.875 --> 57:00.041
No, I trust you.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.834
Then can I please have
the pictures?

57:02.834 --> 57:04.667
Not so fast.

57:04.667 --> 57:07.500
You know,
I've been thinking about all of this,

57:07.500 --> 57:10.542
- thinking about it a lot.
- You rotten bitch.

57:10.542 --> 57:12.667
Maybe,

57:12.667 --> 57:15.667
but I'm a rotten bitch
with $6,000,

57:15.667 --> 57:18.667
- and I want more.
- I can't believe you.

57:18.667 --> 57:21.375
Do you have any idea what
I had to do to get that money?

57:21.375 --> 57:23.375
Get off your high horse,
princess.

57:23.375 --> 57:26.208
You did it once
and you can do it again

57:26.208 --> 57:29.208
to save all of this.

57:29.208 --> 57:31.667
- I know I would.
- What do you want now?

57:31.667 --> 57:34.667
Another little jewelry exchange,
except this time

57:34.667 --> 57:36.333
we can cut out
the middleman

57:36.333 --> 57:39.792
and you can just hand it
directly to me.

57:39.792 --> 57:42.708
I could kill you.

57:42.708 --> 57:44.708
I'm sure you hate me
just enough,

57:44.708 --> 57:47.041
but I don't think
you really want to do that.

57:47.041 --> 57:49.708
You see,
I'm not in this alone.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.250
Now go.

57:52.417 --> 57:55.000
Fine.
Wait here.

58:19.959 --> 58:21.583
That was quick.

58:25.583 --> 58:28.250
- Here.
- Wow.

58:28.250 --> 58:32.083
Haha. Now that is
a nice piece of jewelry.

58:32.083 --> 58:34.625
If it were mine,
I would never part with it.

58:34.625 --> 58:36.750
Some things
you just can't put a price on.

58:36.750 --> 58:40.208
I like your thinking, Katy.

58:40.208 --> 58:42.166
Are you happy now?

58:42.166 --> 58:45.417
Yes, very.

58:45.417 --> 58:48.792
- For now.
- Then get out.

58:48.792 --> 58:50.000
I'll be in touch.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.625
Ciao Bella.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.750
- Hey, Mark.
- Well, what's the good word?

59:03.750 --> 59:05.583
I got six grand.

59:05.583 --> 59:06.959
- It's all hundreds.
- That's all right.

59:06.959 --> 59:08.250
We can break it up later.

59:08.250 --> 59:09.625
Did you do
what I told you to do?

59:09.625 --> 59:12.625
Sure, but she wasn't
too happy about it.

59:12.625 --> 59:14.333
She even threatened me.

59:14.333 --> 59:16.125
Who cares?

59:16.125 --> 59:17.667
What's she gonna do now?

59:17.667 --> 59:20.125
She's, uh,

59:20.125 --> 59:21.917
she's gonna find another
piece of jewelry

59:21.917 --> 59:25.333
and give it to Adam
for another transaction,

59:25.333 --> 59:27.166
but it's gonna take
a few days.

59:27.166 --> 59:28.792
All right.

59:28.792 --> 59:30.625
I guess
all we can do is wait.

59:30.625 --> 59:32.625
Yeah. I need to show my face
around the office

59:32.625 --> 59:34.125
a little bit more.

59:34.125 --> 59:35.625
These long lunches,

59:35.625 --> 59:37.834
people are starting
to get suspicious.

59:37.834 --> 59:40.125
Yeah, well, okay.
See you tonight.

59:40.125 --> 59:42.458
With bells on.

59:53.208 --> 59:55.458
Mr. Fletcher.

59:55.458 --> 59:57.458
I thought you were gonna be out of town
for a few more days.

59:57.458 --> 59:58.834
Yeah, so did I,

59:58.834 --> 01:00:00.291
but everything feel apart

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:02.583
just as quickly
as it had come together.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:04.583
So it really
was no reason for me

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:07.000
to stay in New York
a moment longer.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.375
- Have you been home?
- No, I, uh,

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:12.291
wanted to come by here
for a while

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.792
before dealing with that.

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.375
Do you have
any messages for me?

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:19.834
I do.

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:21.834
I messages are...

01:00:21.834 --> 01:00:25.000
take me right here
on the desk.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.667
Oh, you naughty girl.

01:05:30.667 --> 01:05:35.250
So anything interesting happen
while I was away?

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.083
No, uh, you know,

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.041
- same old same old.
- Hmm.

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:42.041
That's too bad.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:44.667
I was hoping
that you found something new

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.667
to spark your interest.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.834
- Harris?
- Hmm?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.208
Have you ever done something
that you really regret

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:00.834
and you can't take it back?

01:06:00.834 --> 01:06:02.208
Of course.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:05.708
I mean, after years
of doing business,

01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:07.542
I'm sure
that I have done something

01:06:07.542 --> 01:06:09.500
that I probably
shouldn't have.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.875
How do you deal with it?

01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:13.250
How do you live with that?

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.083
I am blessed
with a very short memory

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:21.917
and sometimes
a very small conscience.

01:06:21.917 --> 01:06:25.333
I just forget
about it and move on.

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:28.166
Must be nice.

01:06:31.542 --> 01:06:33.917
Something wrong?

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:35.542
Nothing to worry you about.

01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:37.542
Just something I saw
in an old movie.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:41.500
Uh, I left my cell phone
in the living room.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.083
Excuse me.

01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:51.166
- Hello?
- Katy, it's Mark.

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.583
Remember me?

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:54.959
You asshole,
of course I remember you.

01:06:54.959 --> 01:06:56.792
Listen, it's not what
you think.

01:06:56.792 --> 01:06:59.250
We need to meet.
It's important.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.000
Can you do that?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.041
Maybe.

01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:05.792
My husband is meeting
some friends for drinks in about an hour.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.708
He'll be gone
for the evening.

01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:09.250
Perfect.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:11.375
Don't tell anyone about this,
not anyone.

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.750
Why, are you cheating
on your girlfriend?

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.083
She's not my girlfriend.
Trust me.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.583
I'll explain.

01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:18.458
Meet me at Sea Cliff Lounge
nine o'clock.

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:20.708
Fine, nine o'clock.

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.792
Anything important?

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:35.583
Oh, no,
just another useless
sales call.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.959
Listen, if you're done,
I can clear up the plates.

01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:41.834
I know you
have to get ready to go out.

01:07:41.834 --> 01:07:43.917
Thanks, doll.

01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:45.291
You're the best.

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:10.083
- Please sit down.
- Save it,

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:12.500
you blackmailing
son of a bitch.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.166
Katy, you got it all wrong.

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:16.792
I'm being blackmailed, too,
it's not just you.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.667
What're you saying?

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:20.500
I could lose everything.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.125
This girl, Jan,
she works for your husband.

01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:25.291
She targets people
from his contacts

01:08:25.291 --> 01:08:27.250
and then sets them up.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.125
How did she get
those pictures of us?

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.834
She must've been shadowing you
and you didn't know it.

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:34.834
I just a lucky extra piece
of the puzzle.

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:38.082
Look at this.

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:39.959
Her last victim is dead,

01:08:39.959 --> 01:08:42.125
and I don't think
it's a suicide.

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:45.166
- You think Jan killed her?
- I think that's the final fate

01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:46.500
when she's done
draining you.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.959
No witnesses.

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:53.041
God, but what...
what can we do?

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.207
We gotta kill her.

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:57.542
Killer her?

01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:59.166
You can't be serious.

01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:01.291
It's the only way either of us
will only be free,

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:02.707
and she deserves it.

01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:04.707
She murdered that woman,
you know she did,

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.375
and she'll kill you, too,

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.000
and it'll look
just like a suicide.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.375
This is crazy.
I can't do this.

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.792
It's our only hope.

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:17.041
Don't you hate her
just enough?

01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:19.250
I do.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.207
Good.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:23.375
I need an alibi.

01:09:23.375 --> 01:09:25.291
So I'll tell you
where she is

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.332
and I'll give you my gun.

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:28.707
I'll be waiting in
the bar here

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:30.375
with plenty of witnesses.

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:34.875
If it ever comes out,
I'll say my gun was stolen.

01:09:36.707 --> 01:09:39.332
You go there
and do what you have to do.

01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.375
Don't leave the gun behind.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:43.582
We could destroy it later.

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:45.417
Grab the CDs
with the photo files

01:09:45.417 --> 01:09:46.792
and get out
as fast as you can

01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:49.417
and don't touch
anything else.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:52.917
Think you can do it?

01:09:52.917 --> 01:09:54.583
I don't know...

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:55.875
but I'll try.

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:00.250
Just remember
if you don't,

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.625
you'll never be rid of her.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:05.083
She'll ruin everything
you have in life,

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.208
your marriage,
your home,

01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:08.917
your reputation...

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.375
and then she'll kill you.

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.625
Put this in your purse.

01:10:21.834 --> 01:10:25.125
And good luck.
I'll meet you back here.

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:39.291
- Harris?
- Katy.

01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:42.875
Katy, Katy, no, no, no!

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:19.291
Can I get you anything?

01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:21.291
Vodka martini.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:26.375
Oh, fuck,
what have I done?

01:12:31.417 --> 01:12:32.708
Thank you.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.417
Hope you're not planning
to drive yourself home.

01:12:43.417 --> 01:12:45.750
No, I'm not. I...

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.291
When did you get here?

01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:50.458
I guess I got here
around the same time as you.

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:52.458
Did you see Mark?

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:54.792
Mark?
Who is that?

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:57.417
He's that guy
from the other night.

01:12:57.417 --> 01:13:00.917
Oh, right,
the guy you went home with the other night.

01:13:00.917 --> 01:13:03.875
Handsome.
Was he any good?

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.875
I don't...
I don't want to talk about it.

01:13:06.875 --> 01:13:08.458
You're the one
that brought it up.

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:10.208
I just asked
if you saw him.

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:12.583
Whoa, Katy, calm down.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:15.583
Are you in some kind
of trouble?

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:17.500
I...

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.959
I honestly don't know
if I'm in trouble

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:23.917
or the trouble's
finally over.

01:13:23.917 --> 01:13:25.792
Okay.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.166
I'm meeting some friends
next door,

01:13:27.166 --> 01:13:29.750
just give me a ring
if you need a ride home.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.959
I won't.

01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:47.792
Hello?

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:49.500
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Fletcher,

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.333
but is Harris
still at home?

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.959
He was due here in the office
for a 10:00 a.m. meeting,

01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:56.083
and there's been
no sign of him.

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:58.542
I'm sorry,
I just woke up.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:01.000
- I don't know where he is.
- All right, thank you.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.500
If you see him,
would you please ask him to call in?

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.875
Of course.

01:14:27.417 --> 01:14:30.959
Just look at you.
What a sight.

01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:33.625
Almost noon and you're still
only half-dressed.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.417
What happened to you?

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:38.750
Well, I couldn't sit around
in that bar all night, could I?

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.750
You had some luck,
I take it?

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.750
Excellent, Katy,
now our problems are over.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.333
Are they?

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.375
Just as soon as you
give me the photos.

01:14:54.542 --> 01:14:56.875
We need to destroy these.

01:14:56.875 --> 01:14:59.708
We will.
When the time's right.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.041
What?

01:15:01.041 --> 01:15:03.667
Katy, what you've done for me.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.208
Jan was just not a very
trustworthy partner.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:09.083
I found out she was holding back
a very expensive bracelet,

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:10.959
yours I believe,

01:15:10.959 --> 01:15:12.417
and the ungrateful bitch
was cheating on me

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:14.000
outside of business.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.041
So then it wasn't
just business anymore.

01:15:17.041 --> 01:15:18.917
I killed Harris.

01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:20.750
I know and that's a shame.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.083
I was planning on
blackmailing him, too, eventually.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:26.291
He just couldn't
keep it in his pants.

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:29.750
I seriously wonder
what Jan did for him that you couldn't.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:31.792
Any guesses?

01:15:31.792 --> 01:15:34.750
You rotten bastard.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.458
Of course.

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:39.208
And now this has become
a one-man show thanks to you.

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:42.500
But you're rich now,
or you will be.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.250
All we need to make sure is that
we're not linked to a messy double murder.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.458
Brandy.

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.792
Well, well,

01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:55.625
my favorite drink.

01:15:57.834 --> 01:15:59.625
Did you know that?

01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:02.458
You told me
a couple of nights ago.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:04.458
So I did.

01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:09.458
- Is is too early?
- Under the circumstances?

01:16:09.458 --> 01:16:11.959
- No.
- You make a good point.

01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:17.917
Hmm.

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:20.291
You know my husband
was the king of chemicals,

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.500
- right?
- Huh?

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.125
It really
was no trouble at all,

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:27.333
the poison, that is.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.500
I put it in the brandy.
I knew you couldn't resist.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.708
You're such a pig.

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:34.417
You what?

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:37.000
It's very fast acting.
Or so I'm told.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.667
I'd say you'd
have about 15 minutes

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:41.333
to get to the hospital,

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:43.917
if you hurry, that is.

01:16:43.917 --> 01:16:46.834
- Why?
- Do you think I'm stupid?

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:49.208
You give me your gun
to shoot my husband

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:51.083
and you set yourself up
with a perfect alibi

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:53.125
with no alibi for me.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:55.708
I knew you'd
double cross me.

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.333
You bitch.

01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:59.500
I'll kill you.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.875
It wouldn't
bother me at all

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:02.583
to shoot an intruder
in my own home...

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:04.625
especially an intruder

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.375
that just killed
my husband and his lover.

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:11.000
But, officer,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.500
he must've been
in a jealous rage.

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:21.250
I'd say that you'd have
about 14 minutes now

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:22.708
to get to that hospital,

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:26.000
but you're not
moving fast enough.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:30.166
Hurry, Mark, hurry.

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:36.875
Oh, and I lied
about the hospital.

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:42.750
Sergeant Randall
of the Metro Division

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.208
has issued a statement today

01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:45.583
concerning the death
of an intruder

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:48.000
in the upscale
Riverside section of town.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.417
The deceased man is suspected
of being involved

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:52.875
in the double murder
that occurred earlier that day

01:17:52.875 --> 01:17:54.625
in which the nude bodies
of a man and woman

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:57.750
were found dead by gunshot
wounds in bed together.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.125
Jealously is considered
the motive

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:00.959
although authorities
say all the details

01:18:00.959 --> 01:18:02.792
are not yet clear.

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:23.792
I think $6,000
would be a bargain.

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:30.417
Your obvious elegance,

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:33.917
your sophisticated demeanor,

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.625
and you're beautiful.

01:18:39.792 --> 01:18:42.792
When I get back
and things slow down,

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.458
I'll take you to Vegas.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:50.250
Look, honey,

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.625
I'm here,
I'm available,

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.291
and I have cash.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:10.250
Come on, Katy,

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.250
you're married,
you have a husband,

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.667
he's good looking
and rich.
