WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:04.046
Mr. Rosenthal, you
wanted to see me?

00:04.070 --> 00:06.623
Yeah. Come on in, Bailey.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.221
Is there... something wrong?

00:12.245 --> 00:13.806
If I could just find this file.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.340
Is this about Hampshire State?

00:15.582 --> 00:16.684
About my acceptance?

00:16.708 --> 00:18.603
Yeah. And I have to
tell you Bailey...

00:18.627 --> 00:21.054
Oh, God. Did they
change their minds?

00:21.588 --> 00:23.733
Did they find out about
the C-minus in Physics?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.984
Because I can explain that.

00:25.008 --> 00:26.569
No. It's not about
your Physics grade.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.613
Then, the C in Creative Writing

00:28.637 --> 00:30.156
because I got really
hung up on haikus.

00:30.180 --> 00:33.117
- No, no. Just listen.
- It was the B-minus...

00:33.141 --> 00:34.442
Bailey!

00:38.396 --> 00:41.208
A man named Garrett Williams
came by to see me last week.

00:41.232 --> 00:43.461
He wants to set up funds
for grant seniors.

00:43.485 --> 00:45.004
To make a long story short,

00:45.028 --> 00:46.380
he looked through the files

00:46.404 --> 00:49.457
of all our seniors already
accepted into college,

00:49.824 --> 00:51.334
and he picked you.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.421
Picked me for what?

00:55.622 --> 00:57.090
A college scholarship.

00:59.334 --> 01:00.969
Ten thousand dollars a year.

01:03.254 --> 01:04.806
For all four years.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.225
Oh, my God.

01:09.886 --> 01:11.062
That means...

01:11.638 --> 01:12.823
That means that...

01:12.847 --> 01:14.408
That I can go to college.

01:14.432 --> 01:16.484
That I can actually pay for it.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.570
Congratulations, Bailey.

01:19.688 --> 01:22.991
You are our first ever
Garrett Williams scholar.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.454
Wow.

01:29.614 --> 01:30.748
I, uh...

01:31.116 --> 01:34.002
I never really thought
of myself as a scholar.

01:34.035 --> 01:36.170
Frankly, Bailey, neither did I.

So who is this guy? And
where did he come from?

02:17.328 --> 02:18.639
I have no idea.

02:18.663 --> 02:20.641
Mr. Rosenthal might have
said something about it, but

02:20.665 --> 02:23.811
to be honest, I didn't hear a
word he said after $40,000.

02:23.835 --> 02:25.938
But I'm going to meet
him now, tonight.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.189
He wants to take me to dinner.

02:27.213 --> 02:30.526
God. That is so cool. Dinner
with your benefactor.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.769
You know, I bet he takes
you someplace great.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.655
Oh, God. You think?

02:34.679 --> 02:36.407
I don't do the fancy
dining thing very well.

02:36.431 --> 02:37.575
What if I screw it up?

02:37.599 --> 02:40.119
What if I dump a bowl of
soup on my lap or something,

02:40.143 --> 02:41.537
and he wants to take
his money back?

02:41.561 --> 02:42.705
Bailey, he's not
going to do that.

02:42.729 --> 02:43.622
He's going to love you,

02:43.646 --> 02:46.366
and he'll want to give
you $40,000 right away.

02:46.524 --> 02:48.210
Wow. That's a lot of money.
I mean...

02:48.234 --> 02:51.547
UC schools only cost,
like, $2000 a year.

02:51.571 --> 02:52.590
Yeah.

02:52.614 --> 02:55.041
So that leaves $8000
just to live on.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.001
Uh... yeah.

02:57.285 --> 02:58.846
This is me. I have got to go.

02:58.870 --> 03:00.431
Well, if I don't see
you before dinner,

03:00.455 --> 03:02.641
it's big fork, main course,
little fork, salad.

03:02.665 --> 03:05.510
And don't tuck your napkin
underneath your chin, okay?

03:06.711 --> 03:08.606
God, Bailey, this is going to
change everything for you,

03:08.630 --> 03:10.848
you know that? Bye.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.937
This whole breakfast-date
idea is pretty foreign to me.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.115
I'm not exactly at my
best in the morning.

03:18.139 --> 03:19.857
Uh, that's the point.

03:20.350 --> 03:21.869
Everybody's nice at 8 p.m.

03:21.893 --> 03:24.163
You only find out what
someone's really like

03:24.187 --> 03:25.947
at breakfast time.

03:27.232 --> 03:29.376
If I had had the sense to have
a breakfast date with Wayne,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.452
we'd never have gotten
as far as we did.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.964
Okay, but this isn't, like,
the new thing with you?

03:33.988 --> 03:36.342
I mean, we can still
have dinners, right?

03:36.366 --> 03:38.000
Right. Of course.

03:38.409 --> 03:39.970
Truth is, I wanted
to see you tonight,

03:39.994 --> 03:42.848
but I have my women's
group, so I figured...

03:42.872 --> 03:44.558
I could come by after.

03:44.582 --> 03:46.217
It's going to go late.

03:46.501 --> 03:48.020
I can come by late.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.355
I'll be in bed.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.681
I could come by while
you're in bed.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.476
Probably better not.

03:56.553 --> 03:57.571
Look, Charlie,

03:57.595 --> 04:00.658
ninety percent of the pain
I've experienced as an adult

04:00.682 --> 04:03.452
has been the direct
result of rushing things.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.404
I really can't handle
making any more mistakes.

04:07.772 --> 04:09.375
You don't know this
would be a mistake.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.200
And you don't know it wouldn't.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.840
Damn it!

04:15.864 --> 04:17.841
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.468
Having fun over there?

04:19.492 --> 04:21.971
You know, I promise you,
at no point in my life

04:21.995 --> 04:24.223
am I going to need to know
how to program a computer.

04:24.247 --> 04:25.683
It's really not
that hard, Julia.

04:25.707 --> 04:27.643
Well, it is for me.
I don't get it.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.812
And if I don't start getting
it soon, I'm going to fail.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.939
I mean, fail as in F.

04:31.963 --> 04:33.065
Why don't you let me help you?

04:33.089 --> 04:36.610
No. I told you. I don't think that's a
good idea. It might mess things up.

04:36.634 --> 04:37.862
How is it going to
mess things up?

04:37.886 --> 04:40.771
Well, what if you start
lording it over me?

04:40.930 --> 04:41.824
What?

04:41.848 --> 04:45.286
Because you could. I mean, you could
give in to that little, tiny part of you

04:45.310 --> 04:47.288
that just loves being
better at this than I am.

04:47.312 --> 04:49.155
Wait a minute. Are you serious?

04:49.731 --> 04:51.292
You really think I'm
that competitive?

04:51.316 --> 04:53.544
I'm not saying it's a character flaw.
I'm just saying...

04:53.568 --> 04:55.077
I can't believe you.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.422
I would never do that.

04:56.446 --> 04:57.339
You see what I mean?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.716
I mean, you're not
even helping me yet,

04:58.740 --> 05:00.124
and already we're fighting.

05:00.241 --> 05:02.803
All right, fine. What do
you want to do? Fail?

05:02.827 --> 05:06.640
No. No. No. I'm going
to find a tutor.

05:06.664 --> 05:09.884
Someone who's not you. Someone
who I don't care about.

05:12.462 --> 05:14.263
Did I hear you say
you need a tutor?

05:21.095 --> 05:23.449
So how are things going with Ms.
Schrader?

05:23.473 --> 05:24.450
Fine.

05:24.474 --> 05:25.900
Hand me those, will you?

05:26.976 --> 05:28.037
Thanks.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.330
What's with the sudden interest?

05:29.354 --> 05:31.197
I'm just a little curious.

05:31.814 --> 05:35.076
There's this TLC
rockumentary on MTV today.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.370
I kind of want to watch it.

05:37.528 --> 05:40.248
Only I have this math homework.

05:40.615 --> 05:42.551
Claudia, you're not going to
use my relationship with Emily

05:42.575 --> 05:43.928
to get out of doing
your homework.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.554
What's the point of
you dating my teacher

05:45.578 --> 05:47.097
if I can't get
something out of it?

05:47.121 --> 05:49.799
End of conversation.
Hand me that menu.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.177
Wow. French?

05:53.294 --> 05:55.554
Must be a pretty special
party you're catering.

05:55.838 --> 06:00.235
Yeah. Big TV producer's birthday party.
Some big shot.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.528
Way too busy to
come to the phone,

06:01.552 --> 06:03.614
so I've had to organize
the entire thing

06:03.638 --> 06:06.075
over a series of phone calls
with her assistant, Rosemary.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.566
Wow.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.745
I mean, I bet dealing
with people like that

06:09.769 --> 06:12.446
just makes you never want
to be like that yourself.

06:13.690 --> 06:16.284
I bet it just, you know, makes
you want to help people,

06:16.776 --> 06:20.329
like, say, your...
your siblings.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.666
Claudia, I swear to God, one more try
and I'll tell her to go harder on you.

06:23.908 --> 06:26.961
Man. Whose side are you on?

06:30.456 --> 06:31.632
Miller.

06:31.749 --> 06:32.925
Hi.

06:33.668 --> 06:35.720
Uh, my pen exploded.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.772
Oh.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.139
Ha-ha.

06:38.172 --> 06:40.150
Okay, so here's my problem.

06:40.174 --> 06:43.644
I can't for the life of me get my head
around this computer programming stuff.

06:43.845 --> 06:45.271
That's a nice blouse.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.231
Oh, thanks.

06:47.390 --> 06:49.785
Anyways, here's the program
as I've written it.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.028
It's supposed to alphabetize
a mailing list.

06:53.730 --> 06:55.990
You were wearing it in the
yearbook picture last year.

06:56.274 --> 06:57.491
Was I?

06:57.859 --> 06:59.211
Yeah.

06:59.235 --> 07:00.921
Not in, you know,
your individual one,

07:00.945 --> 07:02.496
but in one of the candids.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.123
Oh.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.510
Anyways, I don't know
what I did wrong,

07:06.534 --> 07:07.845
but it doesn't run.

07:07.869 --> 07:10.796
It was the one,
remember, on page 84.

07:10.913 --> 07:12.057
You almost couldn't
tell it was you

07:12.081 --> 07:14.143
because Alice North
with her big, old hair

07:14.167 --> 07:15.519
is standing right
in front of you.

07:15.543 --> 07:17.345
There's a much
better one on 123.

07:18.379 --> 07:19.356
Oh.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.859
Okay, let's, uh, log you on

07:21.883 --> 07:23.267
and pull this program up.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.447
Uh, I need your password.

07:26.471 --> 07:28.073
- Oh, it's my initials.
- Oh.

07:28.097 --> 07:29.857
- J...
- JGS.

07:30.975 --> 07:32.652
You know my middle initial?

07:34.103 --> 07:36.197
G... for Gordon.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.669
Uh, I don't know if
you ever noticed,

07:40.693 --> 07:42.796
but those three letters together

07:42.820 --> 07:44.830
kind of spell out "jugs."

07:48.826 --> 07:51.138
<i>So that's when I realized
I wasn't cut out</i>

07:51.162 --> 07:52.890
for working for other people.

07:52.914 --> 07:54.725
So I took the bull by the horns,

07:54.749 --> 07:56.185
and I started my own company.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.020
You may have seen
our product around.

07:58.044 --> 08:01.482
Those little statues that
say "World's Greatest Dad,"

08:01.506 --> 08:03.025
or "I Love You This Much."

08:03.049 --> 08:05.652
You make those? Those
are everywhere.

08:05.676 --> 08:07.154
I don't make them anymore.

08:07.178 --> 08:08.614
A couple of years ago,

08:08.638 --> 08:10.657
one of the big guns
in the business came

08:10.681 --> 08:12.076
and bought me out.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.119
Now I get to do things,

08:14.143 --> 08:15.954
like hunting people down

08:15.978 --> 08:17.780
who could use a little help,

08:17.939 --> 08:19.407
like you, Bailey.

08:19.649 --> 08:20.834
Yeah.

08:20.858 --> 08:22.243
Um...

08:22.485 --> 08:25.964
Now, I hope I'm not like opening up
a can of worms here or anything,

08:25.988 --> 08:27.456
but, um...

08:28.157 --> 08:29.625
Why me?

08:30.451 --> 08:34.255
I mean, I'm not exactly
scholarship material.

08:34.871 --> 08:38.509
Mr. Rosenthal told me what
happened to your folks.

08:40.711 --> 08:42.554
Do you mind talking about them?

08:42.797 --> 08:45.307
No. No, not at all.

08:45.883 --> 08:48.320
It's weird, usually people
assume that I don't want to,

08:48.344 --> 08:51.856
but, actually, I kind of
like thinking about them.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.493
Were they warm people? Friendly?

08:54.517 --> 08:55.869
Oh, yeah.

08:55.893 --> 08:57.246
Yeah.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.833
They were always
hugging us and...

09:00.857 --> 09:03.669
And telling us to bring our
friends over for dinner.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.411
Or, at least, Dad was.

09:05.653 --> 09:07.580
Everybody pretty much loved him.

09:07.655 --> 09:09.248
What about your mother?

09:09.449 --> 09:10.634
Well...

09:10.658 --> 09:12.877
People sort of had to
prove themselves to her.

09:13.077 --> 09:14.670
You know, she was...

09:15.246 --> 09:16.964
She had a few more opinions.

09:19.709 --> 09:20.894
What do you think

09:20.918 --> 09:22.762
her opinion would
have been of me?

09:23.796 --> 09:26.525
Well, she would probably
be very grateful to you

09:26.549 --> 09:28.735
for helping me out.

09:28.759 --> 09:31.780
Oh, yeah, sure, but
aside from that.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.398
Uh, I mean, as a person.

09:36.017 --> 09:37.234
Oh.

09:38.436 --> 09:39.862
Um...

09:40.897 --> 09:43.208
Well, I'm really not sure.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.575
Uh...

09:45.109 --> 09:48.871
You know, she was someone that you
kind of had to win over, you know?

09:50.656 --> 09:52.176
Maybe if you gave her

09:52.200 --> 09:54.293
one of those "World's
Greatest Mom" statues.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.141
Well, I'm sure they'd
be very proud of you

09:59.165 --> 10:01.842
for getting yourself
admitted to Hampshire.

10:02.585 --> 10:06.222
I assume that you chose it
because of that music program.

10:06.464 --> 10:07.765
Uh, no.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.308
No, not me.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.819
Tin ear.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.061
Really?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.031
Well, that surprises me,

10:14.055 --> 10:16.899
considering your
mother's talent.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.944
How'd you know about that?

10:21.896 --> 10:23.739
It was in your transcript.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.157
It was?

10:26.317 --> 10:27.660
That's weird.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.672
Well, I see a waiter
bearing down on us,

10:30.696 --> 10:31.924
so we'd better...

10:31.948 --> 10:34.250
Have you any idea
what you'd like?

10:38.538 --> 10:39.964
Thanks again, man.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.939
Hey.

10:46.963 --> 10:48.190
Hey.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.274
Nice party.

10:49.298 --> 10:50.984
Oh, I don't know.

10:51.008 --> 10:53.394
Oh, I don't really like parties.

10:54.178 --> 10:55.989
Looked like you were having fun.

10:56.013 --> 10:56.990
Yeah?

10:57.014 --> 10:59.066
Well, smoke and mirrors.

10:59.684 --> 11:02.444
Well, at least you got
a lot of presents.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.238
I did, didn't I?

11:04.939 --> 11:06.991
Why don't you open
one up for me.

11:08.776 --> 11:09.836
Me?

11:09.860 --> 11:10.837
Yeah.

11:10.861 --> 11:13.215
We'll have a little
mini birthday party,

11:13.239 --> 11:14.999
just the two of us.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.804
"Happy birthday, from Rita."

11:30.089 --> 11:31.432
Afternoon anchor.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.017
Cute, but dim.

11:37.138 --> 11:38.198
Oh...

11:38.222 --> 11:39.241
Just what I needed,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.150
another sterling key ring.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.861
You want it?

11:44.395 --> 11:45.696
No.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.115
Why should I have your present?

11:48.399 --> 11:49.617
Because...

11:49.650 --> 11:51.035
you're a sweetheart.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.504
You don't know that.

11:52.528 --> 11:53.912
Yes, I do.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.757
I didn't order a cake,

11:55.781 --> 11:57.249
and you brought one, anyway.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.136
Well...

11:59.160 --> 12:01.337
every birthday girl
should have a cake.

12:06.042 --> 12:07.394
Yeah, well, um...

12:07.418 --> 12:08.562
I'm billing you by the hour,

12:08.586 --> 12:11.055
so I should probably clock out.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.724
Here's an idea.

12:13.924 --> 12:16.352
Why don't you clock out...

12:16.886 --> 12:18.312
but not leave.

12:20.056 --> 12:21.033
Oh.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.576
Um...

12:22.600 --> 12:23.827
Wow.

12:23.851 --> 12:25.162
I promise it'll be fun.

12:25.186 --> 12:27.237
Uh... Oh, yeah.

12:27.271 --> 12:28.790
No doubt about that.

12:28.814 --> 12:29.875
But, um,

12:29.899 --> 12:31.367
I'm, uh...

12:31.442 --> 12:33.410
I'm... Um, I'm...

12:33.444 --> 12:34.870
I...

12:37.239 --> 12:38.957
Well, that's a first.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.212
I'm usually very
hard to say no to.

12:44.288 --> 12:45.589
Hmm.

13:03.432 --> 13:04.701
Hey.

13:04.725 --> 13:06.110
Hey.

13:07.311 --> 13:09.863
Courier brought that by
for you this morning.

13:10.648 --> 13:11.708
What?

13:11.732 --> 13:13.283
It's got a note on it.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.161
Kathleen, huh?

13:17.571 --> 13:19.164
Yeah. She's, uh...

13:19.824 --> 13:21.875
I did this job for
her last night.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.598
This catering job.

13:26.622 --> 13:28.257
Of course. What else?

13:30.543 --> 13:31.645
It's Armani.

13:31.669 --> 13:33.721
You could sell it and buy a car.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.973
What is she thinking?

13:36.674 --> 13:39.194
She's thinking you'll go to the
reception tonight and wear this.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.769
Invitation in the pocket.

13:41.220 --> 13:44.366
Uh, not worth going into the whole
respect-for-my-privacy thing, huh?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.816
Save your breath.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.944
I'm sure she meant
it as, like, a tip.

13:49.770 --> 13:52.624
Sure. Some people
give 15 percent.

13:52.648 --> 13:54.658
Other people give evening wear.

13:54.775 --> 13:56.336
Hey, it's not like that.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.337
Oh.

13:57.361 --> 13:58.797
Yeah, hi. Rosemary?

13:58.821 --> 14:00.414
It's Charlie Sa...

14:00.739 --> 14:02.624
Yes, I did and...

14:02.658 --> 14:04.553
No, no, no. Don't
send over a tailor.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.212
Listen, I'm calling to tell
you that I can't go tonight.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.142
Yes, I know how she gets.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.969
I mean, I can imagine,
but, um, I'm busy.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.639
No, I can't.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.100
Okay. Right.

14:20.217 --> 14:21.393
Bye.

14:21.510 --> 14:22.612
Way to go, man.

14:22.636 --> 14:23.979
Hold out for jewelry.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.317
Did you guys come here a lot?

14:28.476 --> 14:30.694
Hardly ever, really.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.363
But last night,

14:33.564 --> 14:34.708
when we were at dinner,

14:34.732 --> 14:37.159
I realized that it's
almost been two years.

14:38.152 --> 14:40.839
And, I don't know,

14:40.863 --> 14:42.873
it just kind of made
me want to come.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.460
It's weird.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.724
We spent a lot of time
talking about them.

14:50.748 --> 14:52.716
I mean, he was
asking about them.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.438
Well, a little
curiosity's normal.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.106
I mean, it is a pretty
weird situation.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.431
Yeah, but...

14:59.632 --> 15:01.985
this wasn't, like, usual,

15:02.009 --> 15:04.279
you know, people
being fascinated

15:04.303 --> 15:08.492
by how we get the bills paid
or who potty trains Owen.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.118
This was...

15:10.142 --> 15:11.401
This was different.

15:11.435 --> 15:13.153
He wanted to know about them.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.414
Specifically.

15:14.438 --> 15:17.199
Like, he asked if they
were happily married.

15:17.608 --> 15:19.336
Hmm. That's a little weird.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.869
That's what I'm saying.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.709
This is it.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.419
This is theirs.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.341
It's nice here, Bailey.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.136
Yeah.

15:38.212 --> 15:39.564
I wanted you to come.

15:39.588 --> 15:40.931
Thanks.

15:45.261 --> 15:46.979
Wow. Those are pretty.

15:55.145 --> 15:57.415
Ah. Oh.

15:57.439 --> 15:59.417
Nothing like a good hard jog

15:59.441 --> 16:01.253
to make a girl feel pretty.

16:01.277 --> 16:03.630
How's this hair? Is
this working for you?

16:03.654 --> 16:05.006
I think you look great.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.291
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I mean it.

16:07.616 --> 16:10.794
You look very... athletic.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.633
We could take a cab
back to your place.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.136
No, thanks.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.064
You sure?

16:21.088 --> 16:22.566
Am I sure?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.025
Yes, I'm sure.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.643
I told you I was sure yesterday.

16:27.136 --> 16:28.029
Yeah, but...

16:28.053 --> 16:29.072
But what?

16:29.096 --> 16:31.199
Oh, you know, we have
talked about this.

16:31.223 --> 16:34.651
I've told you how I
feel a few times.

16:34.768 --> 16:36.580
But you keep pounding
away at this...

16:36.604 --> 16:38.915
I'm not pounding.
I'm just... asking.

16:38.939 --> 16:40.407
Why?

16:40.691 --> 16:42.669
Why do you feel this
need to push things?

16:42.693 --> 16:44.671
Do you have a problem with
the way things are here?

16:44.695 --> 16:46.038
No, I just...

16:46.363 --> 16:48.248
It just seems a
little arbitrary.

16:48.616 --> 16:49.759
Waiting.

16:49.783 --> 16:51.678
Actually, what's arbitrary

16:51.702 --> 16:53.388
is you saying that something
needs to happen now,

16:53.412 --> 16:56.600
when all along I have said that
I wanted to give this time.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.760
Why is that so hard for
you to understand?

17:04.798 --> 17:05.983
Little yellow ones...

17:06.008 --> 17:07.809
Um, roses, I think.

17:07.968 --> 17:09.353
You went.

17:09.386 --> 17:11.196
I hate it when you go
without asking me.

17:11.221 --> 17:12.949
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
So it wasn't you?

17:12.973 --> 17:16.108
How could it have been? No one
even told me they were going.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.496
Nope.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.580
Think harder.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.448
Maybe you did, and
you just forgot.

17:21.482 --> 17:24.159
Bailey, I think I'd remember
leaving flowers for Mom.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.009
Hey, Char.

17:31.033 --> 17:32.135
You want to knock?

17:32.159 --> 17:34.044
Were those your flowers
at the cemetery?

17:34.203 --> 17:35.096
No.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.431
Yellow ones under Mom's name?

17:36.455 --> 17:37.798
I said no.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.017
I wonder...

17:39.041 --> 17:40.509
Well, wonder elsewhere.

17:44.338 --> 17:46.107
Okay, wait, so...

17:46.131 --> 17:48.860
the glitch has to be
somewhere in here, right?

17:48.884 --> 17:50.310
Yes, that's right.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.690
You know, this would have been
easier to do at the computer center.

17:55.182 --> 17:56.743
It's all the same if
you have a printout.

17:56.767 --> 17:57.994
Yeah, I guess.

17:58.018 --> 17:59.778
Okay. So...

18:00.813 --> 18:04.668
Oh. The problem has to be right
here with the "go to" command.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.201
Yes, that is right.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.328
And... why?

18:08.529 --> 18:09.997
Why? Um...

18:10.197 --> 18:11.383
Hmm.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.678
Oh! Well, obviously because
there's nothing for it to go to.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.545
Congratulations. You got it.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.307
Miller, what are you...

18:19.331 --> 18:20.308
Uh, just...

18:20.332 --> 18:21.768
Ahem. Stay here.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.927
What is going on? What is this?

18:30.050 --> 18:32.602
You told them we'd
be here, didn't you?

18:32.636 --> 18:33.571
Who? Me?

18:33.595 --> 18:34.990
Miller, what is your problem?

18:35.014 --> 18:36.315
I just...

18:36.890 --> 18:38.108
Look, um...

18:38.225 --> 18:39.202
I have a boyfriend.

18:39.226 --> 18:40.787
and we've been going
out for a long time.

18:40.811 --> 18:42.288
And since you
obviously... I mean...

18:42.312 --> 18:44.916
Clearly, there's an
ulterior motive here, so...

18:44.940 --> 18:46.084
So I just don't think...

18:46.108 --> 18:49.911
I mean, I really think that I
should just find a different tutor.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.307
Charlie, I'll have
to can Rosemary.

19:01.331 --> 19:03.091
She said you were busy.

19:05.836 --> 19:06.896
I was.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.305
But?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.807
Like you said, you're
hard to say no to.

19:11.633 --> 19:12.694
Drink with me.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.987
I haven't been able to rustle up

19:14.011 --> 19:15.979
a decent conversation all night.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.950
Some of the 49ers are
here, as you can see.

19:18.974 --> 19:20.525
Very exciting.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.037
The mayor, naturally.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.445
Yutz.

19:23.479 --> 19:25.623
And a cluster of folks
who work for me.

19:25.647 --> 19:26.948
Smile.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.872
Oh... way too bright.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.462
Much better.

19:42.289 --> 19:43.882
Come here.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.317
Whoa... Sorry.

19:52.341 --> 19:54.017
Forget about it.

19:54.468 --> 19:55.945
You should never
have anything...

19:55.969 --> 19:58.563
you can't afford to lose.

20:07.022 --> 20:08.490
Yeah. I'm coming.

20:13.695 --> 20:15.414
Well, hi, Bailey.

20:15.531 --> 20:16.424
Hi.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.125
It's kind of late,
but come on in.

20:20.911 --> 20:22.921
I've, uh... I've been thinking.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.966
And I know this might sound
really weird, but...

20:26.250 --> 20:28.561
But it's the only thing
that I could figure,

20:28.585 --> 20:30.730
because this whole thing has
seemed really strange to me.

20:30.754 --> 20:32.681
The scholarship,

20:32.881 --> 20:34.400
and dinner...

20:34.424 --> 20:35.851
and then today,

20:36.176 --> 20:37.811
I figured something out.

20:38.762 --> 20:40.480
I figured out that...

20:41.640 --> 20:43.817
That your name isn't Mr.
Williams.

20:46.353 --> 20:47.737
Hmm.

20:48.605 --> 20:50.824
It's Jacob Gordon, isn't it?

20:52.526 --> 20:54.619
You're my mom's dad, aren't you?

20:57.781 --> 20:59.332
You're my grandfather.

21:03.453 --> 21:05.130
So why did you lie?

21:05.789 --> 21:07.466
It was probably guilt.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.635
Right, you probably felt really bad
about how things went with Mom,

21:10.836 --> 21:12.814
about walking out on her
when she was so little,

21:12.838 --> 21:15.191
and you thought that I'd be
as mad at you as she was.

21:15.215 --> 21:18.027
Now, I didn't expect I'd
have to go into any of this.

21:18.051 --> 21:22.439
Or maybe you just... you wanted
to make a good first impression.

21:22.472 --> 21:24.284
You know, make me think
that you were a great guy

21:24.308 --> 21:26.035
before telling me
that we're related.

21:26.059 --> 21:27.277
Was that it?

21:28.061 --> 21:30.447
Or were you ever
going to tell me?

21:30.981 --> 21:31.958
I thought about it,

21:31.982 --> 21:34.659
and I thought you'd be
better off not knowing.

21:35.944 --> 21:37.454
Better off?

21:37.779 --> 21:39.873
Hey. I have no parents.

21:39.948 --> 21:42.918
Okay? So no, I wouldn't
have been better off.

21:43.493 --> 21:44.846
Well, I guess this explains

21:44.870 --> 21:46.713
why you haven't come
back before now.

21:47.664 --> 21:49.799
You just thought we'd
all be better off.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.596
I came here looking for my
daughter Diana, your mother.

21:54.963 --> 21:58.016
I went over to the city hall.
I asked them to look her up.

21:58.175 --> 22:02.604
I expected to get a new address
or a new place of business,

22:03.889 --> 22:07.076
and the woman there
came back and said,

22:07.100 --> 22:09.694
"The person you're looking
for is deceased."

22:11.730 --> 22:14.417
Well, I didn't tell her that I
was looking for my daughter,

22:14.441 --> 22:18.370
so I shouldn't have expected
her to break it to me gently.

22:21.198 --> 22:25.470
It... It shouldn't
really hurt, you know,

22:25.494 --> 22:28.129
losing something you never
had in the first place.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.052
So you don't even know
what she looked like?

22:35.003 --> 22:36.554
As an adult, I mean.

22:39.049 --> 22:42.936
Julia looks like her. A lot.
You'll see when you meet her.

22:43.178 --> 22:44.896
Oh, I'm not going to do that.

22:45.681 --> 22:46.982
What?

22:47.265 --> 22:49.192
I'm not going to meet Julia.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.871
What do you mean?
She's my sister.

22:51.895 --> 22:53.289
I know who she is.

22:53.313 --> 22:55.041
So how could you not
want to meet her?

22:55.065 --> 22:58.243
Oh, Bailey, I'm not going
to meet any of them.

22:59.152 --> 23:03.748
I uh, I came here looking
for a grown daughter,

23:04.199 --> 23:05.259
and that's all.

23:05.283 --> 23:08.128
Because when you get old,
you want to make amends.

23:08.370 --> 23:10.723
But I found my daughter gone,

23:10.747 --> 23:14.718
and I found five kids instead.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.344
Kids.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.264
One of them's only a baby.

23:19.506 --> 23:23.319
You all need things
from a grandfather

23:23.343 --> 23:25.196
that I'm just not
able to give you.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.314
I can't handle five kids.

23:27.973 --> 23:31.619
I can give you money
to help you in school,

23:31.643 --> 23:33.153
but that's it.

23:33.895 --> 23:34.789
Look...

23:34.813 --> 23:39.951
You know, if you're going to go on talking
about meeting the rest of them, don't.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.538
That's not going to happen.

23:53.707 --> 23:55.216
Big night, huh?

23:55.250 --> 23:57.145
You and Ms. Schrader?

23:57.169 --> 24:01.065
Yeah. Um, I have got to...

24:01.089 --> 24:02.525
You look nice.

24:02.549 --> 24:05.185
I mean, I bet she
really appreciated it.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.947
Yeah, listen, Claud, I don't
really feel like talking,

24:07.971 --> 24:09.356
so I'm just...

24:09.931 --> 24:13.902
Well, were you, like,
you know, nice to her?

24:15.270 --> 24:16.205
What?

24:16.229 --> 24:18.041
Well, I mean, obviously,
you stayed over,

24:18.065 --> 24:22.327
so obviously, you...
You know, so...

24:22.444 --> 24:25.048
Well, I just wanted to know
if you considered her needs.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.257
What?

24:26.281 --> 24:27.467
Were you generous?

24:27.491 --> 24:29.343
What the hell do you
know about generous?

24:29.367 --> 24:30.511
Well, I read <i>Cosmo.</i>

24:30.535 --> 24:31.888
Well, you should stop.

24:31.912 --> 24:33.264
Now go away.

24:33.288 --> 24:35.892
For your information, I'm
not that great at Algebra,

24:35.916 --> 24:37.477
so I think I have
the right to know

24:37.501 --> 24:38.603
how Ms. Schrader's
going to react

24:38.627 --> 24:40.637
when she sees the name
Salinger on my test.

24:40.670 --> 24:44.265
Happy and fulfilled or
hostile and frustrated?

24:46.843 --> 24:48.520
Well, you better have cuddled.

24:53.517 --> 24:55.244
I did everything you said.

24:55.268 --> 24:58.414
Okay. Here, just give it to me.

24:58.438 --> 25:00.625
No, I'm not going to learn anything
by reading over your shoulder.

25:00.649 --> 25:03.336
Just let me do it, and then
I'll explain it to you,

25:03.360 --> 25:05.880
and then it'll finally get done,
and it'll take a lot less time.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.590
Okay, fine! Go ahead.
Save the day.

25:07.614 --> 25:09.416
Prove how much smarter you are.

25:11.535 --> 25:13.253
News flash, Julia.

25:13.328 --> 25:16.099
If I wanted to prove how
much smarter I was,

25:16.123 --> 25:18.434
I'd just show you all the A's
I've gotten in this class so far.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.728
- I don't believe you.
- What?

25:20.752 --> 25:22.814
That is exactly what
I told you you'd do.

25:22.838 --> 25:24.190
What? I'm just
trying to help you.

25:24.214 --> 25:27.527
Yeah, you just don't seem to be able to do it
without shoving your superiority in my face.

25:27.551 --> 25:30.687
All right! Fine. You're right.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.824
I'm the one with
the ego problem.

25:32.848 --> 25:34.899
I'm the one with
all the hang-ups.

25:34.975 --> 25:36.119
You were right from
the beginning.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.736
I'm just way too
competitive for you.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.415
So I think it's better that
you just do it by yourself.

25:41.439 --> 25:42.824
Mm hmm.

25:49.447 --> 25:50.707
Okay, here's what I do.

25:50.991 --> 25:51.926
I call him,

25:51.950 --> 25:54.929
I tell him I want to get
together for lunch or something.

25:54.953 --> 25:57.797
And then I tell everyone
else to meet me there.

25:58.415 --> 26:01.384
And then you know when
he sees us all together,

26:01.418 --> 26:04.188
when he sees Owen and when
he gets to look at Julia,

26:04.212 --> 26:06.055
there's no way he'll
be able to walk away.

26:07.674 --> 26:09.100
They're his family.

26:09.342 --> 26:11.362
He'll want to talk
to them, right?

26:11.386 --> 26:12.613
Yeah.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.147
Yeah, maybe.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.735
What if he doesn't, Bailey?

26:19.769 --> 26:21.455
I mean, what if he shows up,

26:21.479 --> 26:22.999
and he takes a look
at all of you,

26:23.023 --> 26:25.533
and he still doesn't want you?

26:26.568 --> 26:28.421
Do you really want Claudia
to see her grandfather

26:28.445 --> 26:29.913
walk away from her?

26:31.531 --> 26:32.832
Well...

26:34.326 --> 26:35.752
I guess...

26:36.494 --> 26:38.505
I guess that's a chance
that I have to take,

26:39.372 --> 26:41.216
because he's our family.

26:41.374 --> 26:43.394
You know? I mean, it's like...

26:43.418 --> 26:46.387
we've been waiting for
him for two years.

26:48.131 --> 26:51.017
You have no idea how much
he means to us, Sarah.

26:53.136 --> 26:54.896
Actually, I do.

26:58.099 --> 26:59.984
Yeah, of course you do.

27:01.519 --> 27:02.872
So what's worse,

27:02.896 --> 27:06.032
getting to know someone
and being disappointed,

27:06.650 --> 27:09.536
or never knowing them at all?

27:10.779 --> 27:12.288
I don't know.

27:19.162 --> 27:21.464
Okay, so here's the thing.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.227
I have a computer
test this afternoon

27:24.251 --> 27:26.729
on which I cannot
afford to do poorly.

27:26.753 --> 27:30.274
And... God knows why, but
you are the only person

27:30.298 --> 27:32.652
who can explain this stuff to me
in a language that I understand.

27:32.676 --> 27:35.270
So what I want to do is...

27:35.595 --> 27:38.064
I want to ask you
to tutor me again.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.201
I don't think so.

27:40.225 --> 27:41.661
Come on. Miller, please?

27:41.685 --> 27:43.069
I'll pay you.

27:44.813 --> 27:47.375
Rather than looking at this
as a purchase agreement,

27:47.399 --> 27:49.450
how about seeing it as a barter?

27:49.859 --> 27:52.328
What? What are you saying?

27:52.570 --> 27:53.756
I give you what you want.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.415
You give me what I want.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.885
What do you want?

27:57.909 --> 27:58.886
A date.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.429
No! No way! Uh-uh.

28:00.453 --> 28:02.306
Fine. Good luck on the test.

28:02.330 --> 28:04.433
Okay, look, we can have coffee.

28:04.457 --> 28:05.768
No.

28:05.792 --> 28:09.105
A date. Dinner, maybe
some dancing...

28:09.129 --> 28:10.690
Dancing? Miller, come on.

28:10.714 --> 28:11.857
You're not going to have fun.

28:11.881 --> 28:13.391
Hey, that's my problem.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.060
Okay, how about this,

28:16.511 --> 28:19.314
a date, but only if I get an A?

28:21.224 --> 28:22.734
How do I know you
won't throw it?

28:22.767 --> 28:25.612
If I were willing to throw this,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

28:28.273 --> 28:29.657
Good point.

28:33.069 --> 28:36.164
Hope you're here as a friend and
not as a disgruntled parent.

28:36.239 --> 28:39.083
No, no. I'm here as, uh...

28:40.201 --> 28:42.045
Yeah, a friend.

28:44.497 --> 28:46.132
In fact, um...

28:46.708 --> 28:48.676
definitely as a friend.

28:51.129 --> 28:55.141
Was there something weird about
the way you just said "friend"?

28:56.843 --> 28:58.269
Maybe.

28:59.137 --> 29:00.355
Yeah.

29:02.057 --> 29:03.367
See...

29:03.391 --> 29:04.901
you're great,

29:05.435 --> 29:08.237
but I think that you and
I... I think that...

29:09.356 --> 29:12.835
we have different
time-frames about all this,

29:12.859 --> 29:16.047
which... Which is... is okay,

29:16.071 --> 29:19.133
but, I mean, timing
is everything, right?

29:19.157 --> 29:23.044
So what I was thinking is... I was
thinking that we should just,

29:23.912 --> 29:26.923
you know, be friends.

29:27.624 --> 29:30.186
So you just broke up with me?

29:30.210 --> 29:31.886
That's what that was?

29:34.255 --> 29:35.399
Yeah.

29:35.423 --> 29:36.609
No, you can't.

29:36.633 --> 29:39.560
You don't have enough information
to break up with me.

29:39.761 --> 29:43.032
I don't know, I kind of figured that the
information that you gave me yesterday...

29:43.056 --> 29:44.742
Oh, yesterday.

29:44.766 --> 29:46.327
Oh, for God's sake.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.789
Yesterday was a single
woman's day from hell.

29:49.813 --> 29:52.500
I mean, it started with
this insane phone call

29:52.524 --> 29:53.709
from my ex-boyfriend Wayne,

29:53.733 --> 29:55.419
during which many
tears were shed.

29:55.443 --> 29:57.328
Not mine, I might add.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.872
And many vicious
names were called.

29:59.948 --> 30:01.300
Those actually were mine.

30:01.324 --> 30:03.678
So, of course,

30:03.702 --> 30:05.429
the idea of rushing
to commitment

30:05.453 --> 30:08.172
or to bed was unnerving.

30:08.957 --> 30:11.394
But if you were to
ask me another time,

30:11.418 --> 30:13.052
like now,

30:13.253 --> 30:15.972
I'd say yes.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.112
I'm sorry. What
just happened here?

30:21.136 --> 30:22.979
Your problem is

30:23.012 --> 30:26.117
that I said I had a problem
moving forward here,

30:26.141 --> 30:28.536
and I'm saying I don't
actually have that problem.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.746
I am... I am problem-free.

30:30.770 --> 30:32.572
I am into this.

30:32.897 --> 30:36.075
So unless you had
another problem...

30:38.945 --> 30:41.789
Um... no.

30:43.366 --> 30:44.834
Okay.

30:46.119 --> 30:49.797
Yup, yup, yup, yup,
yup, yup, yup.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.935
Yupper, yup, yup, yup, yup.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.228
Yup, yup. Yupper.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.271
That's right? You're sure?

30:55.295 --> 30:57.472
Julia, I wrote the test.
I'm sure.

30:58.006 --> 31:00.526
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
wait till I finished grading this?

31:00.550 --> 31:02.862
No. I'm pretty curious
about how I'm doing.

31:02.886 --> 31:05.772
Well, no mistakes yet.

31:06.014 --> 31:07.815
You're obviously
doing very well.

31:09.559 --> 31:12.371
Yup, yup, yup, yup,
yup, yup, yupper.

31:12.395 --> 31:13.946
No. Wait. That isn't right.

31:15.398 --> 31:16.876
Sure it is. That
program will run.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.419
Oh, yeah, maybe it will,

31:18.443 --> 31:20.087
but look at all the
extra steps I used.

31:20.111 --> 31:22.006
It's not the most efficient
way of doing it.

31:22.030 --> 31:23.424
No, but it still works.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.217
Yeah, but I shouldn't
get a full credit.

31:25.241 --> 31:27.752
The question clearly asked
for the best program.

31:28.536 --> 31:30.014
I'm not going to
take points off.

31:30.038 --> 31:33.299
No, you have to. I wasn't efficient.
I wasn't precise.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.344
You want me to take points off?

31:36.628 --> 31:38.554
How else am I going to learn?

31:40.006 --> 31:42.642
All right, five points off.

31:43.051 --> 31:46.562
That drops you down
to an A-minus.

31:46.888 --> 31:47.990
Happy?

31:48.014 --> 31:49.524
Ecstatic.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.238
Yup, yup, yup...

32:01.444 --> 32:03.964
You're early. I wasn't
expecting you till 10.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.717
Yeah, I was hoping
that we could talk.

32:06.741 --> 32:07.843
About?

32:07.867 --> 32:09.585
Well, it's, um...

32:11.788 --> 32:14.475
I'm kind of in a weird
situation right now.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.134
Could you hang on a sec?

32:16.960 --> 32:18.771
I'm in the middle of
some work here, Charlie,

32:18.795 --> 32:21.430
and I hate to be a bitch, but
I've been going all day and...

32:21.840 --> 32:24.026
We both know how little
sleep I had last night.

32:24.050 --> 32:27.071
So, um, I really don't have the
energy for a heart-to-heart.

32:27.095 --> 32:28.563
Is that okay?

32:29.055 --> 32:30.398
Okay.

32:30.807 --> 32:34.235
Um, so should I leave?

32:35.687 --> 32:38.624
Tell you what, give me 25 minutes
to wind up this business,

32:38.648 --> 32:40.700
and I'll be all yours.

32:45.655 --> 32:47.290
Pour yourself a drink.

32:48.199 --> 32:49.458
Yeah, hi.

32:50.243 --> 32:51.878
No, no, it's nothing.

32:56.207 --> 32:57.675
Oh, hi.

32:57.709 --> 33:01.179
I just, uh, called down for
room service so that I...

33:01.546 --> 33:03.315
What's the difference?
Come on in.

33:03.339 --> 33:04.567
Uh, uh-uh.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.017
I don't want to.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.853
And I don't want to
take your money,

33:09.304 --> 33:11.230
and I don't want to
get to know you.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.941
I mean, I do...

33:14.058 --> 33:17.361
but there are five of us,
and we all need you.

33:18.354 --> 33:21.115
You... You... You can't imagine...

33:21.774 --> 33:25.504
I mean, last year, Claudia
needed a grandfather so much

33:25.528 --> 33:27.872
that she actually went out
and tried to find you.

33:28.114 --> 33:29.874
And... And Owen...

33:30.116 --> 33:31.927
My God, Owen never
even knew our parents,

33:31.951 --> 33:33.387
so of course he needs you.

33:33.411 --> 33:37.683
Only you just want to know me,
so I don't know what to do.

33:37.707 --> 33:41.145
Do I lie to them... and
never tell them about you?

33:41.169 --> 33:43.981
Or do I tell them that I met you

33:44.005 --> 33:45.441
and that you're going
to send me to school,

33:45.465 --> 33:47.308
but that you don't want
anything to do with them?

33:47.842 --> 33:51.030
That is... That is like
an impossible choice.

33:51.054 --> 33:52.813
I can't do either one
of those things.

33:52.889 --> 33:56.160
So what I'm going to do is...
is...

33:56.184 --> 33:58.110
I'm going to forget
I ever met you.

34:02.815 --> 34:04.283
You know...

34:04.859 --> 34:07.119
Mom hardly ever
talked about you.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.496
Hardly ever.

34:10.281 --> 34:11.831
And when she did...

34:12.533 --> 34:15.503
she would just say that you were
someone who made things worse.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.882
And now I know what she meant.

34:28.716 --> 34:31.402
No! No! No! No! No! No!

34:31.427 --> 34:33.364
The deal was an A.
I got an A-minus.

34:33.388 --> 34:34.281
That's still an A.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.324
No! It is not! An A is an A.

34:36.349 --> 34:38.534
An A-minus is something
else entirely.

34:38.559 --> 34:42.081
Nonsense. An A-minus is still one of the
three members the greater A family.

34:42.105 --> 34:43.498
You're changing the rules.

34:43.523 --> 34:44.458
You're welshing on a deal.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.626
- I am not.
- Are too.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.960
Miller, what is wrong with you?

34:46.985 --> 34:48.795
You and I are never going
to have a relationship.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.839
We don't even really get along.
So why do you want this?

34:50.862 --> 34:52.216
Because, okay?

34:52.239 --> 34:54.250
- Because what?
- Because!

34:55.326 --> 34:57.586
Because I really
want to have a date.

34:58.287 --> 34:59.672
A good one.

35:00.039 --> 35:01.266
With you.

35:01.290 --> 35:03.394
Have you never had a date before?
Is that it?

35:03.418 --> 35:05.511
No, I have had a date before.

35:06.587 --> 35:08.014
One date...

35:08.423 --> 35:10.433
with Gigi Sanchez.

35:11.551 --> 35:13.352
I took her to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

35:13.928 --> 35:15.656
She was very moved
by the ending.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.408
She seemed to enjoy
the pizza as well.

35:17.432 --> 35:18.659
So it went well, then.

35:18.683 --> 35:19.618
I'm not done.

35:19.642 --> 35:22.079
Um, I saw her safely
to her house,

35:22.103 --> 35:24.238
said goodnight,
thinking all was well.

35:25.356 --> 35:29.452
Later, when I got home, I
happened to look in the mirror.

35:29.610 --> 35:30.587
Oh, no.

35:30.611 --> 35:32.371
I had not one...

35:32.488 --> 35:33.873
not two...

35:34.073 --> 35:36.677
but three strings of cheese
hanging off my face.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.429
- Cheese?
- From the pizza.

35:38.453 --> 35:39.471
Yeah, I know. But how?

35:39.495 --> 35:40.514
I don't know.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.391
But there they were,

35:42.415 --> 35:44.550
and they'd been there
all evening long.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.062
And Gigi had said nothing.

35:47.086 --> 35:48.888
Oh. Wow.

35:50.131 --> 35:51.932
I'm not stupid, Julia.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.769
I know what everyone
thinks of me.

35:55.511 --> 35:57.563
I use the bathrooms too.

35:57.680 --> 36:01.067
I see all the Miller West
jokes they write up there.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.120
I don't understand it.

36:03.144 --> 36:04.371
Because I'm just
like my parents,

36:04.395 --> 36:06.822
and they've always had
a lot of friends.

36:08.524 --> 36:09.710
And I know...

36:09.734 --> 36:11.754
I say a lot of stupid
things to you sometimes,

36:11.778 --> 36:12.713
but...

36:12.737 --> 36:15.883
just because... you know,
I kind of like you,

36:15.907 --> 36:19.001
and... you're real pretty.

36:20.536 --> 36:21.805
And I think...

36:21.829 --> 36:23.839
if you decided to go
on a date with me,

36:23.915 --> 36:26.258
you might find out
that I'm not so bad.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.228
And then maybe you'd
tell your friends,

36:28.252 --> 36:30.554
"Guess what. He's kind of nice."

36:30.713 --> 36:32.691
And then maybe the people
who write all those jokes,

36:32.715 --> 36:33.776
you know, they'd hear about it.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.352
And they'd stop me in the hallway
and they'd talk to me...

36:37.095 --> 36:38.938
And they'd see they
were wrong about me.

36:39.847 --> 36:41.399
You know.

36:41.724 --> 36:44.411
Maybe they'd realize
that... I am different,

36:44.435 --> 36:46.946
but... in a good way.

36:55.947 --> 36:59.134
Claudia! Claudia. Sorry.

36:59.158 --> 37:00.469
I'm glad I caught you.

37:00.493 --> 37:02.503
I made Charlie some
chicken soup...

37:02.620 --> 37:03.847
for that cold he has.

37:03.871 --> 37:05.881
Any chance you could
bring it to him?

37:06.707 --> 37:08.393
Um... sure.

37:08.417 --> 37:09.436
Oh, great.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.179
Thanks. Is he better today?

37:13.798 --> 37:15.182
No.

37:16.592 --> 37:18.352
No, he's still...

37:19.762 --> 37:21.272
bad.

37:21.597 --> 37:23.566
Don't let him pass it on to you.

37:23.724 --> 37:24.785
Don't worry.

37:24.809 --> 37:27.027
I doubt it's contagious.

37:35.278 --> 37:36.912
For your cold.

37:37.238 --> 37:38.298
I don't have a cold.

37:38.322 --> 37:39.591
Yeah, I know.

37:39.615 --> 37:41.426
But, evidently, Ms.
Schrader thinks you do,

37:41.450 --> 37:43.887
which is funny because you
seemed pretty healthy to me

37:43.911 --> 37:46.932
when you came home from her
house at 8:30 this morning.

37:46.956 --> 37:48.100
Damn.

37:48.124 --> 37:49.884
You're darned right, damn!

37:50.001 --> 37:52.136
You weren't at her
house, were you?

37:55.173 --> 37:56.567
You were cheating on her.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.309
Hey, I am not cheating on her.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.227
It's not like Emily and I are...

38:02.263 --> 38:04.324
My personal life is
none of your business.

38:04.348 --> 38:07.411
It is too my business. Ms.
Schrader is my teacher.

38:07.435 --> 38:08.579
And she's really nice.

38:08.603 --> 38:11.582
And now she's going to be all upset
when she finds out about this,

38:11.606 --> 38:13.792
not to mention what it'll
do to my report card.

38:13.816 --> 38:15.169
She is not going to find out.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.203
Just fix it, Charlie.

38:17.570 --> 38:19.747
Whoever that other
girl is, dump her.

38:19.822 --> 38:21.665
That's pretty easy for you.

38:21.824 --> 38:24.251
And go back to being nice to Ms.
Schrader.

38:26.412 --> 38:27.880
What are you looking at?

38:29.582 --> 38:32.519
See, this is the one I like, but
Eli, this guy, the drummer,

38:32.543 --> 38:34.470
he thinks he looks fat, so...

38:38.549 --> 38:40.559
You sure you want to
look at these now?

38:42.178 --> 38:43.864
Oh. I'm sorry. Yeah.

38:43.888 --> 38:46.190
Which one did you say you liked?

38:46.265 --> 38:49.360
Because if there's something else that
you'd rather talk about, I understand.

38:50.144 --> 38:51.788
There's not that much to say.

38:51.812 --> 38:54.031
You know? It's over.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.543
And I'm fine. Really.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.244
I'm exactly where I
was four days ago.

38:58.319 --> 38:59.745
I didn't have the money then.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.549
I was figuring I'd
just take out a loan

39:02.573 --> 39:03.592
or get financial aid,

39:03.616 --> 39:05.292
and I can still do that, easy.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.387
So...

39:07.411 --> 39:09.672
So really, I'm no
worse off at all.

39:15.169 --> 39:16.762
He has a crooked tooth.

39:17.713 --> 39:19.265
Like this one.

39:19.298 --> 39:21.016
Overlaps the one next to it.

39:21.717 --> 39:23.185
Mom had that.

39:24.345 --> 39:25.854
And so does Charlie.

39:39.068 --> 39:40.536
So how's the tickle?

39:41.404 --> 39:42.506
Hi.

39:42.530 --> 39:44.675
Is it gone? Did the soup work?

39:44.699 --> 39:48.303
Yeah. Oh, yeah. The
soup was amazing.

39:48.327 --> 39:50.796
Good. So, uh...

39:51.539 --> 39:53.642
I was wondering what you
were doing tonight.

39:53.666 --> 39:54.851
Family dinner night.

39:54.875 --> 39:57.562
Oh. That's too bad, Because I...

39:57.586 --> 39:59.231
No, thanks. I see him.

39:59.255 --> 40:00.723
Charlie.

40:03.592 --> 40:05.362
I can't stay. I
have a car waiting.

40:05.386 --> 40:07.114
Martin Rossmore from
the other night.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.991
He wants you to do his
40th anniversary.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.367
I told him you were very hot,

40:10.391 --> 40:13.287
so be sure to put him on hold at least
twice during your conversation.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.496
I quoted him a hundred a head.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.206
I know, I know, it's
twice what you ask,

40:16.230 --> 40:18.282
but it's what you're worth,
so don't argue, all right?

40:18.441 --> 40:20.451
Call him tonight, and
then call me right after.

40:21.610 --> 40:24.747
- Um... - I don't have time for
"ums." I'm late for a meeting.

40:25.072 --> 40:27.333
Nice to meet you. Bye.

40:28.242 --> 40:30.628
No, really, the
pleasure was all mine.

40:31.912 --> 40:33.589
What was that?

40:34.665 --> 40:35.684
She's...

40:35.708 --> 40:36.852
this woman...

40:36.876 --> 40:38.469
that, um...

40:39.086 --> 40:40.480
I catered.

40:40.504 --> 40:42.056
The birthday lady?

40:42.214 --> 40:43.358
Right.

40:43.382 --> 40:44.776
Ha-ha. Yes.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.226
Oh, scary.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.823
Right. Anyway, um...

40:49.847 --> 40:50.991
you were saying...

40:51.015 --> 40:52.858
Oh, right. Okay.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.786
So here's what I'm thinking.

40:54.810 --> 40:58.248
After your family dinner,
ice cream, hot fudge

40:58.272 --> 40:59.458
and a movie.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.909
And if you wanted, you
could bring a toothbrush.

41:02.735 --> 41:03.879
A toothbrush?

41:03.903 --> 41:05.537
Well, yeah.

41:05.946 --> 41:07.549
You won't necessarily need it,

41:07.573 --> 41:12.252
but you might if you... wanted
to stay over or something.

41:14.413 --> 41:16.465
I know. Go figure.

41:24.715 --> 41:27.226
I didn't realize you're such
a good basketball player.

41:27.259 --> 41:30.521
Ah, it's easy. It's all
angles and vectors.

41:30.679 --> 41:31.782
Mechanical physics.

41:31.806 --> 41:33.450
I never thought of it that way.

41:33.474 --> 41:34.868
Everything is physics, Julia.

41:34.892 --> 41:35.952
Not everything.

41:35.976 --> 41:37.528
Yeah, everything.

41:37.645 --> 41:39.664
The light reflecting
off those windows,

41:39.688 --> 41:40.906
optical physics.

41:41.982 --> 41:44.368
How that siren is
barely audible?

41:44.443 --> 41:46.129
Acoustical physics.

41:46.153 --> 41:48.298
The way that water's going to splash
when a car drives through it,

41:48.322 --> 41:50.416
again, mechanical physics.

41:50.783 --> 41:52.835
What about falling in love?
That's not physics.

41:53.911 --> 41:56.422
It can perhaps be rooted
in thermodynamics.

41:56.705 --> 41:57.849
The exchange of heat
between matter.

41:57.873 --> 41:59.351
Or maybe it's chemistry.

41:59.375 --> 42:02.261
No. That's just a myth
perpetuated by the chemists.

42:03.379 --> 42:04.356
Um...

42:04.380 --> 42:06.608
I should just cut down
this street here.

42:06.632 --> 42:07.651
Oh.

42:07.675 --> 42:09.486
I've got to get to my
family's restaurant.

42:09.510 --> 42:11.228
I'm meeting up with them.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.480
Well... thanks.

42:15.474 --> 42:17.661
You know what? This was fun.

42:17.685 --> 42:19.445
Well, good. I'm pleased.

42:20.688 --> 42:21.989
So...

42:24.608 --> 42:26.744
You can give me a little
kiss if you want.

42:26.986 --> 42:28.422
Oh, that's all right.

42:28.446 --> 42:30.465
No. Really, I won't mind.

42:30.489 --> 42:32.082
That's okay, Julia.

42:33.033 --> 42:34.626
Okay.

42:35.077 --> 42:38.255
I think a first real kiss
should mean something...

42:38.747 --> 42:40.132
to both people.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.012
You're really romantic, Miller.
You know that?

42:45.546 --> 42:47.139
Yeah, I do.

42:47.673 --> 42:49.057
Bye.

42:52.386 --> 42:54.656
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.241
It's okay. We haven't
even ordered.

42:56.265 --> 42:58.692
Yeah. What's with the
service in this place?

42:58.851 --> 43:00.287
What's everybody having?

43:00.311 --> 43:01.246
I've eaten already.

43:01.270 --> 43:02.289
I can't decide.

43:02.313 --> 43:03.957
Why don't you order
two things, Charlie,

43:03.981 --> 43:05.292
eat them both, but
not tell them.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.075
Shut up, Claudia.

43:08.903 --> 43:10.788
Uh, I hope you'll excuse me.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.136
I wonder if, um...

43:16.160 --> 43:18.170
I could introduce myself.

43:21.415 --> 43:23.592
My name is Jacob Gordon.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.094
I'm...

43:26.712 --> 43:29.014
I'm your grandfather.
