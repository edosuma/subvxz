WEBVTT

00:14.583 --> 00:16.959
- 'Oh!'
- 'Hey!'

00:20.917 --> 00:22.917
We shouldn't
even be out.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.458
She's convinced,
planes are going to fall out

00:24.542 --> 00:25.834
of the sky at midnight.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.458
'I read the papers.'

00:27.542 --> 00:29.333
Come on, we've
got 15 minutes
left.

00:29.417 --> 00:33.125
I don't have a resolution.
I'm very happy with my life.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.041
Guys, we'll have exactly one

00:35.125 --> 00:37.166
millennium New Years
in our lives.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.709
A clean slate.

00:38.792 --> 00:40.000
Okay, um..

00:40.083 --> 00:42.959
...to stop talking about
my catering business

00:43.041 --> 00:44.333
and actually start it.

00:44.417 --> 00:46.000
Excellent.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.458
Jill?

00:48.542 --> 00:49.792
Get Mel to stop gambling.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.291
Good luck with that.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.583
Mel?

00:53.667 --> 00:55.250
Start a family.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.583
Kids and all.

00:56.667 --> 00:57.625
(Susan)
'Wow.'

00:57.709 --> 00:59.834
That leaves you, baby.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.709
To make Gary, the starting
goalie at Whitman next
year.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.458
Your resolution is
supposed to be about you.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.125
Uh, forget me.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.166
This is the century
my boy becomes a man.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.625
To the new century.

01:11.709 --> 01:13.792
And a brand new start.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.959
(Jill)
'Here here.'

01:25.667 --> 01:30.625
(people cheering)
'Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six'

01:30.709 --> 01:32.500
'five, four, three..'

02:25.250 --> 02:26.583
(Rush)
'Hi, Gil.'

02:26.667 --> 02:28.542
This is Lilly Rush.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.875
The lady I was
telling you
about.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.834
Hi, Tami.
How are you doing?

02:33.917 --> 02:35.875
Great. Good.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.875
Terrible, actually.

02:39.959 --> 02:44.000
Tami's four years sober.
She got her chip tonight.

02:44.083 --> 02:47.291
That doesn't
sound terrible to
me.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.250
It doesn't change
what I did.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.375
Which was what?

02:53.458 --> 02:56.500
Four years ago
I had hit rock bottom.

02:56.583 --> 02:59.417
It was New Year's Eve,
the millennium.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.834
You know, party
like it's 1999.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.083
So you did?

03:05.166 --> 03:09.208
And that night
I hit someone..

03:09.291 --> 03:10.792
...with my car.

03:10.875 --> 03:14.375
'She can't tell
you more than that.'

03:14.458 --> 03:17.125
Tami's what they
call a blackout drunk.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.500
But I saw on
the news the next day.

03:20.583 --> 03:24.125
A man named Greg Cardiff
was killed that night.

03:24.208 --> 03:26.208
A hit and run.

03:26.291 --> 03:30.208
I never came forward until now.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.750
What makes you think you
did it if you can't
remember?

03:32.834 --> 03:34.875
It happened in Bella Vista.

03:34.959 --> 03:36.875
Where I was bar
hopping that night.

03:39.333 --> 03:42.000
After about 10:30, I'm blank
until the next day.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.625
Find any damage to your car?

03:45.709 --> 03:47.125
A dent on the hood.

03:47.208 --> 03:50.458
A broken headlight...and blood.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.625
I think I mowed that
poor man down that night

03:55.709 --> 03:57.834
and then just drove away.

04:34.166 --> 04:38.542
Greg Cardiff, 39, first
murder of the millennium.

04:38.625 --> 04:39.500
Tami's right.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.834
This was the only unsolved

04:40.917 --> 04:43.458
auto-ped the first half of 2000.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.458
Hit at the corner of 5th
and Christian in Bella
Vista.

04:46.542 --> 04:47.667
Pronounced at midnight.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.375
Happy friggin' New Year.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.792
Had a wife and a
14 year old son.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.041
Any witnesses?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.291
30 neighborhood surveys.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.917
Nobody saw or heard nothing.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.625
- Probably all hung over.
- 'Be worth going back.'

04:58.709 --> 05:00.166
Re-interviewing.

05:00.250 --> 05:03.458
Looks like they only talked
to 29 of the 30 neighbors.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.166
This last one, Russell
Brinkley
didn't respond to phone calls

05:06.250 --> 05:08.375
or cards left at the door.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.375
Maybe out of town?
Holiday travel.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.500
Not a holiday now.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.000
Your friend still got her car?

05:13.083 --> 05:15.667
Maybe we can match the damage
to these crime scene photos.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.083
Nah, she hid it
in a garage for a
year

05:17.166 --> 05:18.333
then junked it in Wilmington.

05:18.417 --> 05:21.458
- But she gave us a picture.
- Hmm.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.375
Let's take it around.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.750
Maybe somebody will
recognize her or the car.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.375
Bella Vista is
a tight neighborhood.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.709
Before we start
knocking on doors

05:29.792 --> 05:31.375
we better tell the widow
we're looking back.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.083
- Anything I can do?
- You're doing a lot.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.417
Bringing us Tami.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.333
Some AA buddy I am, huh?

05:37.417 --> 05:40.625
Convincing her to come forward
could land her in prison.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.125
Mom.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.709
'It's cops.'

05:47.792 --> 05:51.333
Detectives Rush and Valens.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.583
- What's wrong? What happened?
- 'Nothing's wrong.'

05:53.667 --> 05:57.208
- We're here about Greg.
- What about him?

05:57.291 --> 06:01.208
We may have a new direction
on the hit and run.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.625
Gary, maybe you should..

06:02.709 --> 06:03.875
I'm okay.

06:03.959 --> 06:06.917
Can we show you a picture?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.583
Oh, um. I'm sorry. I..

06:12.333 --> 06:15.375
The last four years
have been..

06:15.458 --> 06:17.041
She cried for the first three.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.834
Still wear your
wedding band, huh?

06:20.917 --> 06:26.375
Uh, no, actually, I just got
remarried a few months ago.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.166
Congratulations.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.959
But I'll do
whatever I can to
help.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.750
Do you recognize her?

06:36.166 --> 06:38.709
Maybe from the bar that night?

06:38.792 --> 06:41.583
No, she doesn't look
familiar but the Jeep
does.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.959
Greg wasn't feeling well
that
night so I walked him out.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.917
Let me go back and get
Mel and Jill. We'll drive you.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.792
I've got to play hockey
with Gary tomorrow.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.458
Not feeling like this.

06:53.542 --> 06:55.792
I think I feel
better.
I just gotta
walk.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.500
- Get some air.
- I'll go with you.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.375
No, I want you to go
back in and celebrate

06:59.458 --> 07:00.917
the millennium with
Jill and Mel.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.166
I'll meet you at home.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.000
I'll be there by 12:30.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.917
Hey.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.542
See you next century.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.875
If only I had gone with him.

07:21.959 --> 07:23.792
Mom, how could you know?

07:25.208 --> 07:28.166
So the Jeep was outside
the bar just before midnight?

07:28.250 --> 07:31.500
If not that one,
one just like it.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.250
What position do you play?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.000
Goalie.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.500
He made varsity in ninth grade.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.709
What? Is this guy deaf?

07:43.792 --> 07:45.875
Same guy who avoided
talking to the cops

07:45.959 --> 07:47.083
first time around.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.875
Come on, Brinkley! Open up!

07:50.166 --> 07:52.333
- He's in there.
- 'Philadelphia PD.'

07:52.417 --> 07:55.709
We just saw you get the
mail.
Answer this door.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.458
I'll check around back.

07:59.458 --> 08:02.792
(Vera)
'I'm not leaving
until you open this door!'

08:05.208 --> 08:07.542
- Hi, there.
- Oh, crap.

08:07.625 --> 08:08.709
Pretty much.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.667
I didn't see anything.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.709
(Rush)
This guy saw something, boss.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.542
Something like Tami
running over Greg Cardiff?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.750
Whatever it was,
he don't wanna
tell.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.709
Unresponsive four years back.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.375
Tried to ditch
Vera and Jeffries
today.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.417
Homebody like him, he probably
wasn't out New Year's Eve.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.583
Let me guess where you were.

08:31.667 --> 08:32.625
Here.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.375
How'd it go with Greg's widow?

08:34.458 --> 08:36.834
She saw a red Jeep
outside the bar that night.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.500
Red Jeep, like Tami drove.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.083
I was hoping things
wouldn't point to her.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.083
Tsk. She's a nice lady.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.417
Nice or not, no one
gets a free murder.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.208
Vera says this
Russell's got demophobia.

08:48.291 --> 08:51.917
- Fear of?
- Crowds.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.291
So crowd him.

08:55.792 --> 08:59.125
I told you I mind
my own business.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.041
- Mind if we join?
- More the merrier.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.792
Russell here, he's got
a big picture window

09:04.875 --> 09:06.834
overlooking the street
where Greg got hit.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.125
Doesn't mean
I saw anything.

09:08.208 --> 09:12.291
Detective Valens.
How are you doing?

09:12.375 --> 09:14.291
Is there a bigger room?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.041
Tsk. This is the only one open.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.959
Open is not what I'd call it.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.792
It is kind of small, isn't it?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.041
Cozy.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.792
Even if I saw something..

09:25.875 --> 09:27.125
...I wouldn't
wanna get involved.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.208
Why not?

09:29.291 --> 09:30.542
It was four years ago.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.125
You wouldn't be able
to make charges stick.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.291
Actually our batting average

09:33.375 --> 09:34.542
is pretty good, Russell.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.333
And I gotta live
in my neighborhood.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.041
So it was a neighbor?

09:38.125 --> 09:39.792
A neighbor you're afraid of?

09:39.875 --> 09:42.208
- I didn't say that.
- Russell.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.000
I'm appealing
to your decency here.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.834
I think you're
a decent person.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.458
What did you see that night?

09:54.709 --> 09:58.750
Something...I wish I hadn't.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.041
(Rush)
'You're sure it was
a brown Continental?'

10:37.125 --> 10:38.333
Positive.

10:38.417 --> 10:39.792
Everyone in Bella Vista
knew that car.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.208
You saw it coming,
you went the other way.

10:41.291 --> 10:42.875
You know the owner?

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
This jerk named John Butler.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.417
You scared of Butler?

10:49.500 --> 10:52.000
That make me less of a man?

10:52.083 --> 10:53.458
Tell us about him.

10:56.291 --> 10:59.208
He's a rotten guy, mean.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.000
Makes life hell for
everyone who lives
there.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.583
He killed Harriet.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.583
Who's Harriet?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.959
My poodle.

11:09.041 --> 11:10.291
Butler sicced
his pit-bull on her

11:10.375 --> 11:13.166
because she chewed
up his newspaper.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.333
She was a puppy.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.083
(Rush)
'Are you sure he hit Greg?'

11:19.166 --> 11:20.875
Probably on purpose, too.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.375
Oh, this guy's gonna kill me.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.417
We'll protect you, Russell.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.834
I read crime novels.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.834
You can't do nothing.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.417
I'm getting out of town,
you guys need me..

11:34.500 --> 11:36.625
...I'll be at my mom's
in Pittsburgh.

11:46.709 --> 11:50.125
(Rush)
'So, where were you
January 1st, 2000?'

11:50.208 --> 11:52.667
Uh, at Elisa's grandma's..

11:52.750 --> 11:55.125
...scarfin' the brunch
of the ages.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.333
What do you mean?

11:56.417 --> 11:57.583
Uh, she was
one of them kooks

11:57.667 --> 11:59.583
thought the world
was gonna stop spinning.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.750
Stockpiled hams,
potatoes, eggs

12:02.834 --> 12:06.542
enough to last
40 days and nights.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.750
You've been with her
a while then, huh?
Elisa?

12:09.834 --> 12:12.625
Huh, kids when we met.

12:12.709 --> 12:16.041
You don't believe in
making it official?

12:17.750 --> 12:19.792
It's complicated.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.250
Like you and Kite, right?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.250
I guess.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.166
She do something
you can't forgive?

12:29.250 --> 12:30.125
Nah.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.500
She, uh...she got sick.

12:33.583 --> 12:34.917
She..

12:36.959 --> 12:39.500
...she went to
the puzzle house for a
while.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.583
That bad, huh?

12:44.667 --> 12:47.625
Remember that kid, uh,
Barry, on the Richardson
job

12:47.709 --> 12:51.083
'heard the voices
in the closet?'

12:51.166 --> 12:52.250
Yeah.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.041
Like him.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.625
I-I hear the meds
really help..

13:00.125 --> 13:01.500
...with that.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.583
Yeah. She's having
a good run now.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.458
Thanks.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.542
For telling me, Scotty.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.291
This is it.

13:23.291 --> 13:26.041
(Valens)
'Hmm.'

13:26.125 --> 13:28.208
- Should've brought your coat.
- Yeah.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.500
Want mine?

13:29.583 --> 13:31.041
Wouldn't make you
less of a man.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.709
I'd rather freeze now.

13:33.792 --> 13:36.041
We're looking
for John Butler.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.959
Thanks.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.125
Are you Butler?

13:46.625 --> 13:48.875
- Depends who's asking.
- I am.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.041
I didn't do
nothin' to no one.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.291
Now, why is that
so hard to believe?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.542
You a cop, too?

13:55.625 --> 13:58.000
Gotta admire
a piece with a piece.

13:58.083 --> 14:00.333
Maybe when we're done here,
I could buy you a steak.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.083
Vegetarian.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.917
John, you remember a guy
from the neighborhood

14:04.000 --> 14:06.291
named Greg Cardiff?

14:06.375 --> 14:10.041
Knew him...till someone
turned him into roadkill.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.041
You have a personal
relationship with Greg?

14:13.125 --> 14:14.583
We didn't travel
in the same circles.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.917
'Cause we have a witness
who saw you run him down.

14:17.917 --> 14:18.750
Me?

14:18.834 --> 14:19.917
We're just trying to figure

14:20.000 --> 14:21.417
if this was
an accident or a murder.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.250
Hey, ho. Whoever said
that is full of it.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.250
I didn't hit no one.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.250
Well, you were arrested

14:26.333 --> 14:27.792
for drunk driving in '86.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.917
- Then again in '91.
- So?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.417
Not a big stretch you'd be out
drunk driving New Year's Eve.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.417
All three counts
of assault and battery

14:34.500 --> 14:36.083
public nuisance complaints.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.500
We even heard you turned
your pit bull loose

14:37.583 --> 14:39.542
'on a poor little dog.'

14:39.625 --> 14:41.667
That mutt was
a yappy little bitch.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.291
I did the neighborhood a favor.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.625
Yeah, well, we're gonna do
the neighborhood a favor
now.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.125
Bring you in,
impound your
car.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.458
I don't even have
that car no more.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.542
Matter of fact, I didn't have it

14:49.625 --> 14:51.667
that New Year's, neither.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.959
- Convenient.
- Happens to be true.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.583
Got stolen that night.

15:12.709 --> 15:17.375
- Hey. You've got to pay
first.
- Three bucks a gallon?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.333
Look, there might not
be any gas tomorrow.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.500
I was here last week.
It was a buck and a quarter.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.834
It-it's the owner, okay?

15:22.917 --> 15:24.250
He says this Y2K thing's got

15:24.333 --> 15:25.542
people willing to pay big.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.625
That's price gouging.

15:26.709 --> 15:27.959
Y-You got to talk to the owner.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.417
Hey, I been filling up
here since before

15:29.500 --> 15:30.709
you could get a woody, kid.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.417
Look, I'm sorry,
okay?
It's not up to me.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.041
- I'm sorry.
- Turn the pump on.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.000
'Turn that pump on!'

15:36.083 --> 15:38.000
Turn your pump on!

15:46.709 --> 15:48.166
You report your car stolen?

15:48.250 --> 15:49.542
That night, they found it

15:49.625 --> 15:52.458
stripped in Jersey
two days later.

15:52.542 --> 15:55.333
Check for yourself.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.709
Will do.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.834
Call me about that steak.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.083
(Susan)
'John Butler?'

16:07.166 --> 16:10.333
Everyone knows him
and hates him.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.166
Did Greg know him, too?

16:12.250 --> 16:14.041
Unfortunately.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.375
In fact, he saw him
that afternoon.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.959
Butler confronted us
at the market.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.291
- I was with Greg.
- This is my husband, Mel.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.458
- Mel Davis.
- Hey.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.250
Good friend of Greg's
at college.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.291
'We were all together'

16:27.375 --> 16:29.250
that New Year's Eve.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.625
The-the three of you?

16:30.709 --> 16:33.917
Jill, Mel's ex-wife,
was also there.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.125
And you two
are married now.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.375
We know. It's weird.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.875
'Gary tells us all the time.'

16:40.959 --> 16:44.000
Mel was really good
to Gary and me

16:44.083 --> 16:45.667
after we lost Greg.

16:45.750 --> 16:50.250
And, uh, Jill left me
that year for greener
pastures.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.625
Namely, a cardiologist.

16:53.709 --> 16:56.750
Four years
later,
here we are.

16:56.834 --> 16:59.667
Nice...for both of you.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.792
I told Mel you were
asking about a red
Jeep.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.083
We got new information now.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.417
Points to Butler.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.125
Butler drove a...
uh, Continental.

17:09.208 --> 17:12.250
Tell us about
seeing him that day.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.834
Well, Greg and I
went on a beer run

17:14.917 --> 17:18.041
and, uh, Butler was waiting
for us in the parking lot.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.417
So who do you like,
Minnesota or Oregon?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.792
Oregon's not even ranked.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.291
Gophers are gonna
destroy them.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.583
(Butler)
'Hey, Cardiff!'

17:25.667 --> 17:27.792
- You scratched my car.
- What?

17:27.875 --> 17:31.041
Door of your fag-mobile
nicked my door.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.625
Are you kidding?

17:32.709 --> 17:33.917
Was I talking to you?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.667
I don't think I even
touched it, John.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.792
Saw it with my own eyes.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.041
I'm real sorry if I did.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.333
- That don't cut it.
- 'Hey, idiot.'

17:41.417 --> 17:43.542
Look at your
car,
look at Greg's.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.667
Now, you tell me, who should
be worried about scratches?

17:45.750 --> 17:47.000
Mel, it's not worth it.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.041
Do you want to talk
to me like that?

17:49.125 --> 17:50.792
I'll drop both
of you right here!

17:50.875 --> 17:54.125
Whoa, whoa! John.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.750
I apologize, John.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.625
'Won't happen again.'

17:57.709 --> 18:00.083
Happy New Year, okay?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.041
Moron.

18:11.792 --> 18:14.709
So Butler was looking
for a fight.

18:14.792 --> 18:18.250
Well, I got to admit,
I egged him on.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.458
You think he hit Greg that
night
on purpose to get back at him?

18:21.542 --> 18:24.250
If he did, we'll find out.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.333
Thought you didn't have
a beef with Greg Cardiff,
John.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.417
I didn't.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.083
You had a run-in
with him the day he died

18:32.166 --> 18:33.500
bitched him out
for dinging your
car.

18:33.583 --> 18:34.625
That was nothing.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.083
Greg and his pal
called you an idiot.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.333
A moron, and you don't
seem like the type

18:37.417 --> 18:38.333
'just looks away.'

18:38.417 --> 18:39.458
I told you, my car was stolen

18:39.542 --> 18:40.959
before Cardiff got slammed.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.667
(Rush)
'You made that report
at 1:00 a.m.'

18:42.750 --> 18:44.375
An hour after Greg was killed.

18:44.458 --> 18:47.041
Plenty of time to ditch
the car, report it missing.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.709
Kid at the station
wouldn't let me use the
phone

18:48.792 --> 18:50.750
to call the cops.
I had to walk there.

18:50.834 --> 18:51.834
Yeah, we talked to that kid.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.333
So he'll tell you it was stolen.

18:53.417 --> 18:54.625
He don't wanna tell
nothing to help you John.

18:54.709 --> 18:55.709
No one does.

18:55.792 --> 18:56.917
But a lot of people are willing

18:57.000 --> 18:59.041
to testify against you.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.834
Talk about
your poor character.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.542
"We have a 80-year-old
oak
tree in our front yard.

19:05.625 --> 19:09.333
While we were at church,
Butler took a chainsaw to it."

19:09.417 --> 19:11.709
That...that thing shed
its leaves onto my
lawn.

19:11.792 --> 19:13.917
"Butler ran into my
12-year-old daughter

19:14.000 --> 19:15.583
on her way to school.
Called her a whore."

19:15.667 --> 19:17.250
I said they dressed
her that way.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.166
You gotta remember
how young boys think.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.208
"John asked me out
three or four times.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.750
"I politely declined.

19:22.834 --> 19:26.417
He spray-painted whore
on my front door."

19:26.500 --> 19:28.166
What's your point?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.750
What goes around
comes around.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.417
All these neighbors
are gonna be more than happy

19:31.500 --> 19:32.417
to help put you away.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.166
You had a beef with Greg.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.375
We got an eyewitness puts

19:35.458 --> 19:37.041
your car at the crime scene.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.333
And 40-plus character witnesses

19:38.417 --> 19:40.542
to say this guy's
gotta be guilty.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.792
Look.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.709
I'm not the guy
you really want

19:47.792 --> 19:49.417
but I can help you.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.959
We're listening.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.000
My car was stolen.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.917
But I had a guy do it for me.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.542
Hired him, you know..

19:57.625 --> 19:59.250
...for the insurance money.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.959
Keep talking.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.583
He must've hit Cardiff
when he was going

20:02.667 --> 20:04.083
to ditch the car in Jersey.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.667
Name?

20:05.750 --> 20:08.333
Trevor McKai.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.625
Lives over in Bridesburg.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.041
You Trevor?

20:24.792 --> 20:26.667
Yeah.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.959
Homicide.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.834
Wanna talk to you about
a hit-and-run a while back.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.375
- Over in Bella Vista.
- Uh-huh.

20:34.458 --> 20:37.250
Happened New Year's Eve
at the Millennium.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.041
Were you over that way?

20:39.125 --> 20:41.959
Hmm. Bella Vista?

20:42.041 --> 20:44.166
Nah, I was out with friends
here in Bridesburg.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.792
We need the names
of those friends.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.500
Mm-mm.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.792
I don't really
know their names.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.417
So..

20:50.500 --> 20:53.291
'...not good friends, then.'

20:53.375 --> 20:56.208
You know, I was just
hanging out with people.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.417
- Partying and whatnot.
- Somebody's house?

20:58.500 --> 20:59.959
'At a bar?'

21:02.125 --> 21:03.792
This bar, maybe?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:12.750 --> 21:15.166
Forget it, man.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.542
I've been waiting four years
for you guys to show up.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
Got something you wanna
get off your chest?

21:22.583 --> 21:25.667
- I could tell you your
rights.
- Nah.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.583
I don't need them.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.333
It was me
that hit that guy.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.583
Driving John Butler's
stolen car?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.166
No kidding.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.500
I had no choice.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.125
What the hell?

22:19.750 --> 22:22.583
Oh, God.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.667
I hit him.

22:35.750 --> 22:39.000
I'm not denying it.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.834
But the man was already down.

22:41.917 --> 22:44.083
That doesn't make
sense, Trevor.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.417
I'm telling you.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.542
That Greg Cardiff

22:48.625 --> 22:51.166
wasn't crossing that street.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.917
He was lying in it.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.208
Guy says Greg was
face down in the street

23:05.291 --> 23:06.500
before he ran him over?

23:06.583 --> 23:08.166
- That's his story.
- Do we believe it?

23:08.250 --> 23:09.792
Well, Trevor's got
reason to lie but

23:09.875 --> 23:11.959
the first report did say
Greg wasn't feeling good.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.291
That's why he
went home
early.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.166
What? Heart attack? Aneurysm?

23:15.250 --> 23:16.625
How about sloppy drunk?

23:16.709 --> 23:19.125
- It was New Year's Eve.
- Let's ask the wife.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.458
We didn't have
this new direction

23:20.542 --> 23:22.291
I'd take a hard look
at Susan and Mel.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.625
I was thinking the same thing.

23:23.709 --> 23:24.709
Anyone got a favor coming

23:24.792 --> 23:26.583
from the coroner's office?

23:26.667 --> 23:27.959
I ain't going to the morgue.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.166
The smell of that
place kills me.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.625
Listen to the kitchen bitch.

23:31.709 --> 23:33.083
Being an auto-ped,
probably didn't do

23:33.166 --> 23:35.667
a full tox screen
at autopsy but..

23:35.750 --> 23:37.625
...maybe they saved
some tissue samples.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.667
Well, I'll give 'em a call.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.792
Yeah. Right after you
disinfect the phone.

23:46.166 --> 23:48.709
Greg wasn't drunk
that night, he was sick.

23:48.792 --> 23:50.667
Sick? How?

23:50.750 --> 23:51.792
Well, we didn't know.

23:51.875 --> 23:54.000
It was off and on
for about a month.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.583
But he felt good that day,
until we got to the bar.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.333
What kind of symptoms he have?

23:58.417 --> 24:01.083
Headache. Nausea. Why?

24:01.166 --> 24:03.000
It's possible Greg
collapsed on the street

24:03.083 --> 24:05.208
before he got hit by the car.

24:05.291 --> 24:06.208
From what?

24:06.291 --> 24:07.333
Did he have any kind of

24:07.417 --> 24:08.709
chronic condition?

24:08.792 --> 24:10.458
No. He was a health nut.

24:10.542 --> 24:11.542
He jogged every day.

24:11.625 --> 24:15.000
He played hockey with Gary.

24:15.083 --> 24:18.333
You know, Gary was
sick that day, too.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.834
Same symptoms?

24:19.917 --> 24:21.041
I think so.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.750
Where's Gary now?

24:25.041 --> 24:26.959
Yeah, I was sick, too.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.625
Headache, nausea..

24:28.709 --> 24:30.709
...same as your dad?

24:30.792 --> 24:32.458
What's that have to do
with him getting hit?

24:32.542 --> 24:34.709
His health that night
might have been a
factor.

24:34.792 --> 24:36.875
Anything else you remember
about your symptoms?

24:39.000 --> 24:42.125
I think I was seeing
things kind of yellow.

24:44.208 --> 24:47.083
- What do you mean?
- Like..

24:47.166 --> 24:49.792
Like there was a yellow filter
over everything I saw.

24:49.875 --> 24:53.000
So you and your dad share
any
of the same foods that day?

24:53.083 --> 24:54.834
Dad ate something
that mom cooked.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.291
And, uh, I had fast food.

24:56.375 --> 24:59.542
How about chips or pretzels
watching the game?

24:59.625 --> 25:02.166
No.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.750
But there was something
else we shared.

25:05.834 --> 25:07.542
Hey, there he is.

25:07.625 --> 25:08.917
Good scrimmage?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.417
Yeah.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.834
(Greg)
'Sorry about this
morning, Gare.'

25:12.917 --> 25:13.875
That's alright.

25:13.959 --> 25:14.875
I'm better today.

25:14.959 --> 25:16.041
How about tomorrow we set up

25:16.125 --> 25:17.458
the net in the driveway?

25:17.542 --> 25:19.667
Yeah, cool.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.250
'Cause your mom loves
when we slam pucks

25:21.333 --> 25:22.583
against the garage.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.125
I do love it, very much.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.291
Anyone need anything?

25:27.375 --> 25:30.083
- No thanks, honey.
- No thanks.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.834
- Hey, hey, hey.
- 'Gary.'

25:42.917 --> 25:44.625
What are doing?
You know better.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.834
Sorry.

25:45.917 --> 25:48.458
You've got a few years
to go there, kid.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.792
Maybe I got sick from drinking
from the same glass.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.917
Maybe.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.667
So Mel and your mom
were both mad

25:57.750 --> 25:59.208
that you touched
that margarita?

25:59.291 --> 26:01.583
I didn't see what
the big deal was.

26:01.667 --> 26:02.959
It was only a sip.

26:04.458 --> 26:07.875
Father and son drink the same
margarita, both fall sick.

26:07.959 --> 26:10.208
Susan and Mel are both there
both could have slipped

26:10.291 --> 26:11.500
something into the drink.

26:11.583 --> 26:12.709
And they take
big pains to stop

26:12.792 --> 26:13.792
the kid from drinking.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.125
Because dad's the target.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.500
Fast forward four years

26:16.583 --> 26:18.542
and the widow
and best friend are
married.

26:18.625 --> 26:19.792
Maybe they were
seeing each
other

26:19.875 --> 26:21.291
decided to get rid of Greg.

26:21.375 --> 26:22.542
I wanna find Mel's ex

26:22.625 --> 26:24.667
to see if she
suspected an affair.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.875
Visitor.

26:28.375 --> 26:32.166
At least there's
good news for someone.

26:32.250 --> 26:35.583
Why don't you go talk
to Mel, Scotty? Man to
man.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.333
(Rush)
'Hi, Tami.'

26:37.417 --> 26:40.375
Thanks for coming in.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.875
You have news?

26:42.959 --> 26:44.625
It wasn't you.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.792
Oh, that's great.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.834
You're sure?

26:48.917 --> 26:51.000
Someone confessed to hitting
Greg Cardiff that night.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.792
And there's an
eyewitness to back the story.

26:52.875 --> 26:56.000
- I confessed.
- To what you thought you did.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.458
What about the blood,
the damage to my car?

26:58.542 --> 27:02.125
Maybe an animal? Maybe you did
hit someone, injured them.

27:02.208 --> 27:05.333
But we only have
homicide records here.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.000
Point is, you
didn't
kill anyone.

27:12.250 --> 27:15.250
Uh, did you want it
to be you, Tami?

27:15.333 --> 27:19.000
I quit drinking
'cause
I thought I hit this
guy.

27:21.542 --> 27:25.083
That was keeping me
in check. Now I..

27:25.166 --> 27:26.542
Now what?

27:26.625 --> 27:30.333
I really want a gin and tonic.

27:33.583 --> 27:35.834
We're thinking
food poisoning.

27:35.917 --> 27:38.500
And that he just fell
in front of this car?

27:38.583 --> 27:41.250
I've seen stranger things.

27:41.959 --> 27:44.125
Oh, crap.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.458
You okay there, Mel?

27:47.959 --> 27:49.208
Knocks the wind out
of your sails

27:49.291 --> 27:51.000
when you hear
something like that.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.291
He was my best friend.

27:54.375 --> 27:55.750
Yeah.

27:55.834 --> 27:58.250
How'd he get the food poisoning?

27:58.333 --> 28:00.625
Maybe the margarita
he was drinking.

28:00.709 --> 28:02.083
Really.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.333
Gary says he took a sip
of his dad's drink that
day

28:04.417 --> 28:07.750
and you kind of
swatted it out of his
hand.

28:07.834 --> 28:09.125
I might have.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.166
How come?

28:10.250 --> 28:11.458
He was only 14.

28:11.542 --> 28:13.709
I mean, he's still not
old enough to drink.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.166
Oh, can I..

28:17.250 --> 28:19.542
...ask you an aside here?

28:19.625 --> 28:20.500
Sure.

28:20.583 --> 28:24.166
I ain't judging, believe me.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.041
You and Susan..

28:26.125 --> 28:28.083
...you really take
up after Greg's
death?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.291
Yeah.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.542
'Cause I know if I'm you

28:30.625 --> 28:31.875
and I'm looking at her

28:31.959 --> 28:33.875
and she's interested back..

28:33.959 --> 28:36.625
I mean, married or
not,
flesh is weak.

28:36.709 --> 28:41.208
Maybe it makes me
a real geek...but no.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.000
I was faithful.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.125
Well, you're a better
man than me.

28:47.208 --> 28:50.208
So, uh, the margaritas..

28:50.291 --> 28:52.291
...you remember who made 'em?

28:55.750 --> 28:57.041
Rolling Rock, huh?

28:57.125 --> 28:58.625
You guys are
really living
it up.

28:58.709 --> 29:00.375
Or it reminds us
of our college days.

29:00.458 --> 29:02.125
Oh, wouldn't you
rather have a
margarita?

29:04.375 --> 29:05.625
- Mel?
- Oh, no.

29:05.709 --> 29:06.750
I don't drink tequila.

29:06.834 --> 29:08.959
Ever since Hell Night
freshman year.

29:09.041 --> 29:12.041
Mel did 15 shots in 15 minutes.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.542
I still get sick
thinking about it.

29:13.625 --> 29:15.125
You ended up in Student Health
for three days.

29:15.208 --> 29:18.166
My parents almost
sued the fraternity.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.291
I'm, uh, good with this.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.834
'So Susan made
the margaritas'

29:27.917 --> 29:30.917
and the margaritas
made Greg sick.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.333
I don't like
what you're suggesting.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.417
- Just adding up the facts.
- Look.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.709
I'll say it again.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.000
There was no..

29:38.083 --> 29:40.250
...love triangle
before Greg died.

29:40.333 --> 29:41.458
Would your
ex-wife
back that up?

29:41.542 --> 29:42.750
Sure.

29:42.834 --> 29:44.667
Jill's the one who
left me for another man.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.000
- Know where we can find Jill?
- No.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.917
We're out of touch.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.250
Who was the doctor
she ended up with?

29:51.333 --> 29:54.667
Michael...something.

29:54.750 --> 29:55.875
Jill left you for this guy

29:55.959 --> 29:57.208
'and you never got his name?'

29:57.291 --> 29:58.750
Look, if your wife tells you

29:58.834 --> 30:00.667
that she's screwing another guy

30:00.750 --> 30:02.875
that's really
all you need to know.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.250
'Anything else is just'

30:04.333 --> 30:06.417
salt in the wound.

30:09.166 --> 30:12.041
Found Jill Davis, or at
least
her answering machine.

30:12.125 --> 30:14.041
Good, 'cause Mel's
either a great liar

30:14.125 --> 30:15.208
or didn't have nothing
to do with this.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.542
Well, somebody definitely

30:16.625 --> 30:18.166
wanted Greg Cardiff dead.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.208
Get something from the coroners?

30:19.291 --> 30:20.250
No tissue samples but

30:20.333 --> 30:21.667
Greg was an organ donor.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.458
Transplant unit at
Pennsylvania Hospital

30:23.542 --> 30:25.709
had some blood samples stored.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.959
- Lethal levels of digoxin.
- What's that?

30:28.041 --> 30:30.375
Medication used to stabilize
an irregular heart beat.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.375
(Vera)
'And it can be deadly
if you want it to be.'

30:32.458 --> 30:34.875
Overdose symptoms
are nausea, headache

30:34.959 --> 30:36.375
yellow-tinted vision..

30:36.458 --> 30:37.667
Gary's symptoms.

30:37.750 --> 30:38.834
...and fainting.

30:38.917 --> 30:41.291
Maybe why Greg dropped
in the street.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.542
Guess who's
in the emergency room.

30:43.625 --> 30:44.750
Who?

30:44.834 --> 30:46.083
Mel Davis.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.125
Exact same symptoms as Greg.

30:56.208 --> 30:57.792
(Valens)
'We found digoxin'

30:57.875 --> 30:59.875
in his system.

30:59.959 --> 31:03.583
I don't know
what digoxin is.

31:03.667 --> 31:04.917
Prescription drug.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.583
But you use it wrong,
it's just poison.

31:10.667 --> 31:11.959
Well, I've never heard of it.

31:12.041 --> 31:14.250
All that cooking
and catering you do, Susie.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.083
It'd be pretty easy
to slip a few lethal drops

31:16.166 --> 31:17.333
'into dinner every night.'

31:17.417 --> 31:18.583
I have to get to the hospital.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.583
Are you tired of Mel,
is that it?

31:20.667 --> 31:21.667
What?

31:21.750 --> 31:23.041
He was good to you and all

31:23.125 --> 31:24.792
just like Greg.

31:24.875 --> 31:26.917
Maybe you just had
your fill of him.

31:27.000 --> 31:27.959
I love Mel.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.959
You know about black widows?

31:30.041 --> 31:32.000
'They're beautiful,
but deadly.'

31:32.083 --> 31:33.458
Destroy their mates when their

31:33.542 --> 31:34.625
usefulness is over.

31:34.709 --> 31:35.959
I didn't hurt my husband.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.542
Oh, you've gotta be
more specific, Susie.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.083
Which husband do you mean?
The one already dead?

31:39.166 --> 31:41.834
Or the one in the hospital?

31:41.917 --> 31:43.208
If I was unhappy with Mel

31:43.291 --> 31:46.041
why wouldn't I
just get a
divorce?

31:46.125 --> 31:47.500
I don't know.

31:47.583 --> 31:50.417
Maybe you just don't
like confrontation.

31:53.959 --> 31:56.375
Yellow-tinted vision?

31:56.458 --> 31:58.417
It's weird, huh?

31:58.500 --> 32:01.583
They're running
a million tests.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.750
Where'd you have your last meal?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.583
Home.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.417
Something Susan made?

32:09.125 --> 32:10.208
So?

32:10.291 --> 32:12.000
Mel, there was a
drug
called digoxin

32:12.083 --> 32:13.500
in Greg's system.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.750
'A lethal amount.'

32:15.834 --> 32:16.875
What is that?

32:16.959 --> 32:19.041
A heart medication.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.500
I think they're going to
find
that in your system, too.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.500
Your partner's already been
down this road with me.

32:24.583 --> 32:27.667
Susan wouldn't harm me.

32:27.750 --> 32:30.417
And she never
would have hurt Greg.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.792
She adored him.

32:31.875 --> 32:33.792
Maybe she adored you more.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.000
- No.
- 'At least, for a while.'

32:35.083 --> 32:37.417
It was always him.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.291
Greg was Plan A.

32:39.375 --> 32:40.834
I'm just the one
she settled for.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.375
But the fact remains, Mel

32:42.458 --> 32:44.583
you have the same
symptoms as Greg.

32:44.667 --> 32:47.792
You know the name of her
business? "Cardiff Catering."

32:47.875 --> 32:49.625
She still uses his name.

32:49.709 --> 32:50.750
That's how loyal
she is to him.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.291
Hi, boss.

32:58.375 --> 33:00.375
Jill's there?

33:00.458 --> 33:03.125
Go ahead.
I'll be there in
ten.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.375
You talking
about my Jill?

33:05.458 --> 33:08.417
Yeah. We tracked her down.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.250
Want me to give her a message?

33:11.542 --> 33:13.667
No.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.667
No message.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.458
Mel always had it bad for Susan.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.041
Even when you
were married to
him?

33:24.125 --> 33:26.750
I didn't like to think so
but you know in your gut.

33:26.834 --> 33:29.083
It's the reason
why we broke up.

33:29.166 --> 33:32.542
I thought you left him
for a cardiologist.

33:32.625 --> 33:33.750
Only because I
didn't
feel like waiting

33:33.834 --> 33:35.375
around for the affair.

33:35.458 --> 33:36.917
- Was there an affair?
- No.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.500
Susan would
never leave
Greg.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.291
Wasn't until after he died
that Mel saw his opening.

33:41.375 --> 33:43.542
Oh, yeah, two days
after the funeral

33:43.625 --> 33:45.208
he wanted me
to draw up
papers.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.083
Hmm. Not too subtle.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.667
No.

33:48.750 --> 33:52.000
So, Jill, you being
married to a heart
doctor

33:52.083 --> 33:54.458
you probably know
what digoxin is.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.917
Yeah. I take it.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.542
I met my husband because
of my heart condition.

34:08.542 --> 34:11.625
Hospital confirmed
Mel was poisoned with digoxin.

34:11.709 --> 34:12.625
Just like Greg.

34:12.709 --> 34:14.000
Probably no surprise

34:14.083 --> 34:15.291
to Susie here.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.583
And turns out Mel's ex-wife

34:17.667 --> 34:19.959
has been taking that drug

34:20.041 --> 34:21.625
her whole life.

34:21.709 --> 34:22.959
You think Jill did something?

34:23.041 --> 34:24.291
Jill's over Mel.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.625
She has a new husband.

34:25.709 --> 34:28.250
And she never had
anything against
Greg.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.333
But Mel, on the other hand--

34:31.417 --> 34:35.542
Mel had real good
access
to digoxin over the
years.

34:35.625 --> 34:38.125
Did Mel and Greg eat
a lot of meals
together?

34:38.208 --> 34:40.291
'Go out drinking?'

34:40.375 --> 34:42.792
They were best friends.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.458
According to Jill,
Mel had big plans for
you

34:45.542 --> 34:48.083
'soon as Greg got
out of the picture.'

34:48.166 --> 34:50.583
Who else could it
have been, Susie?

34:52.917 --> 34:54.834
Oh, no.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.083
You remember something?

34:57.166 --> 35:02.333
I thought he was
just being a friend.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.834
But, even on the day
of the funeral--

35:04.917 --> 35:07.291
Mel was moving in?

35:09.542 --> 35:12.166
I saw a guy get a ticket
on my way to the cemetery

35:12.250 --> 35:13.583
and I just..

35:15.834 --> 35:19.208
...didn't understand.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.000
Understand what?

35:21.083 --> 35:23.333
How the world keeps going?

35:23.417 --> 35:25.542
I mean, how do people
do mundane things

35:25.625 --> 35:26.583
like write up a ticket

35:26.667 --> 35:31.417
when everything
is over?

35:31.500 --> 35:33.000
Hey.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.583
Baby, I'm sorry.

35:39.959 --> 35:41.291
I'm sorry.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.208
(Mel)
'It's not over.'

35:44.291 --> 35:47.542
You're going to be happy again.

35:47.625 --> 35:48.959
'The three of us'

35:49.041 --> 35:51.959
are all gonna
stick together.

35:52.041 --> 35:54.125
We're all
gonna be happy.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.333
(Valens)
"The three of us"?

36:00.417 --> 36:03.375
When he was still
married to Jill.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.041
But why would Mel
make himself sick?

36:06.125 --> 36:07.041
'He never thought Greg's'

36:07.125 --> 36:09.041
poisoning would come out.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.083
Knowing it would,
he got desperate.

36:12.166 --> 36:13.959
Tried to set you up, Susie.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.750
Hospital just called.

36:25.834 --> 36:27.709
Mel Davis skipped out.

36:31.166 --> 36:36.792
(man over bullhorn)
'Driver, remove the keys
from the ignition.'

36:36.875 --> 36:39.834
'Throw the keys out
of the window.'

36:39.917 --> 36:41.917
'Now!'

36:43.166 --> 36:44.208
Tracked him through
his cell phone.

36:44.291 --> 36:45.417
'He's not responding to orders.'

36:45.500 --> 36:46.750
So what's he doing?

36:46.834 --> 36:48.375
Fugitives don't usually
think before they run.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.458
My guess is,
he's just thinking now.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.792
Can I try?

36:55.041 --> 36:56.959
Mel, this is Detective Rush.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.458
Show us your hands.

36:58.542 --> 37:01.542
Please put your hands
outside the window.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.667
- He got a gun?
- I don't know.

37:05.750 --> 37:08.208
We give him much more time,
maybe we'll find out.

37:14.792 --> 37:16.250
Stay.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.625
Hey, boy. Over there.

37:36.875 --> 37:37.875
Careful.

37:37.959 --> 37:39.875
I get the driver's side.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.709
He's gone.

38:03.917 --> 38:06.166
I'll call the coroner.

38:13.250 --> 38:16.417
Mel wasn't thinking.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.625
He was writing.

38:20.166 --> 38:22.333
What's it say?

38:24.000 --> 38:27.667
"My millennium resolution
was to have a family..

38:27.750 --> 38:29.208
"...kids and all.

38:29.291 --> 38:32.875
"Susan and Gary
were that family.

38:32.959 --> 38:34.375
"But even after Greg was gone

38:34.458 --> 38:36.583
"even though she married me

38:36.667 --> 38:38.959
I was never more than Plan B."

39:08.792 --> 39:10.625
Let's have
our own toast..

39:10.709 --> 39:12.083
...just the guys.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.125
- To 2000.
- The year 2000.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.750
What? What is it?

39:23.834 --> 39:26.333
I don't think Jill and I
are gonna make it.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.041
You serious?

39:30.125 --> 39:32.041
I couldn't say it
in front of her but..

39:32.125 --> 39:33.959
...I'm gonna make
some changes in 2000.

39:34.041 --> 39:36.959
That's...that's my
real resolution.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.291
Marriage is hard work, Mel.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.625
Problem is..

39:43.709 --> 39:45.625
...I got the wrong marriage.

39:47.542 --> 39:49.667
Well, I'm sorry.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.625
Me, too.

39:55.709 --> 39:57.625
Bottom's up.
