LOOK. I NEED CAFFEINE
OR WHISKEY.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.461
OR BOTH -- IRISH COFFEE.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.762
MM.
I WILL KISS YOU.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.832
[ GRUNTS ]
[ BEEPING ]

40:33.865 --> 40:36.902
ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT CAFFREY
STARTED TO MOVE, I SET AN ALERT.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.136
WHERE'S HE HEADED?

40:38.169 --> 40:39.938
TALKING TO ANGELO
MADE ME REALIZE

40:39.971 --> 40:41.773
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE KEY
ALL WRONG.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.942
SO A MEDALLION THIEF
SET YOU STRAIGHT?

40:43.975 --> 40:46.912
NO. HE REMINDED ME OF WHO I WAS
BEFORE I WENT TO PRISON.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.815
10 YEAR AGO, ELLEN AND I
HAD NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.249
WELL, SHE WAS
IN WITNESS PROTECTION,

40:51.282 --> 40:52.250
AND YOU WERE ON THE LAM.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.752
RIGHT.
WE HAD NO RELATIONSHIP.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.687
AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND A VANTAGE POINT

40:55.721 --> 40:57.188
THAT WAS RELEVANT
TO HER LIFE,

40:57.222 --> 40:59.190
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO FIND ONE

40:59.224 --> 41:01.192
THAT WAS RELEVANT TO MINE.

41:01.226 --> 41:04.596
LOOKS LIKE A PIER
IN QUEENS.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.198
OF COURSE.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.300
IT'S THOSE DAMN CORKS!

41:09.334 --> 41:11.637
COME AGAIN?
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.271
BACK THEN,
ALL ELLEN KNEW ABOUT NEAL

41:13.304 --> 41:15.807
WAS THAT HIS TIME
WAS RUNNING OUT.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.509
[ CHUCKLES ]
I WAS CHASING HIM.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.210
CORKS?

41:19.244 --> 41:22.280
WHEN PETER WAS CLOSING IN,
I STARTED SAVING CORKS.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.182
I'D COME DOWN HERE
WITH A BOTTLE OF WINE,

41:24.215 --> 41:26.117
WATCH THE SUN SET
OVER THE CITY.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.154
EACH SUNSET AND EACH CORK
MARKED ANOTHER DAY I WAS FREE.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.522
AND YOU TOLD ELLEN?

41:30.556 --> 41:32.858
YEAH. THE LAST TIME I SAW HER,
BEFORE I WENT TO PRISON.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.459
SO MAYBE SHE FIGURED
WHEN YOU GOT OUT...

41:34.492 --> 41:36.862
I'D PICK UP
WHERE I LEFT OFF.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.964
RIGHT HERE.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.366
[ CHUCKLES ] LET ME GUESS --
THAT'S YOUR CAFFREY BOX.

41:41.399 --> 41:44.970
EVERYTHING THAT DIDN'T MAKE
SENSE TO LOG INTO EVIDENCE.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.538
YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S A CORK IN THERE?

41:46.572 --> 41:48.707
NO. HE HAD THIS RITUAL
WITH CORKS.

41:48.740 --> 41:49.975
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

41:50.008 --> 41:52.377
BUT HE USED TO GO
TO THIS PIER IN QUEENS --

41:52.410 --> 41:53.812
THAT
PIER IN QUEENS.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.347
IT'S GOT TO BE IN HERE.
PLEASE BE IN HERE.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.916
PLEASE BE HERE.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.951
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ]

HOLD THIS.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.133
MOZ.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.773
IT COVERS EVERYTHING
EXCEPT ONE BUILDING.

42:21.807 --> 42:23.842
HE FOUND IT.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.376
HE FOUND WHAT?

42:27.245 --> 42:29.781
SHE LED YOU
TO THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

42:29.815 --> 42:31.817
YEAH. YEAH, SHE DID.
