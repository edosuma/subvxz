ANNOUNCER: The two American
astronauts, we're being...

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.742
Sergei.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:08.786
Jimmy, there's a problem
on the Space Station.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.412
Three astronauts escaped already,

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:13.290
but three are left,
and they're running out of oxygen.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.000
I heard something
about a rescue attempt.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.003
The escape pod is only designed
to carry three people,

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:21.507
which means three crew members
remained behind.

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:23.258
In order to save oxygen,

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.844
they have taken shelter
in the Columbia module

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.805
and powered down
the rest of the station.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.640
Now all eyes are on Russia,

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.643
awaiting a timetable
for the Soyuz rescue launch.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.728
With no way to fix the damaged
ammonia pumps,

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:37.898
they're hoping to flood the oxygen-deprived
module with hydrogen

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.901
as a stopgap measure
until the rescue ship arrives.

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.445
We have very little
information at this time,

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.280
but we do have David Brookwell
on the phone.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.448
There's something wrong, guys.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.659
I have a plan, but I need your help.

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:49.952
What do you got in mind?

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.203
First, I need to find someone.

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:52.704
REPORTER:
David, can you hear me?

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:54.122
The team aboard
the International Space Station

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.458
are now performing
emergency procedures

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.836
in an attempt to reduce
oxygen consumption.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.462
We can reinstate shuttle Atlantis.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.131
It won't work.
The astronauts will run out of air

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.133
before the rescue team
can reach them in seven hours.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:07.177
Well, what do you suggest?

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.929
Keep looking for other options.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.855
So if I hadn't called,
you just would have left.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.983
Wow. I'm glad you're
not insecure or anything.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.445
I was kind of hoping for a smile.

01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:29.658
I've been plotting, you know,

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:30.784
either to get me back here

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.286
or to get you to go to Vegas.

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:33.829
I'm running on fumes right now.

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.247
I've got a lot on my mind.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:36.874
Do you mean the astronauts
up at the Station?

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:39.084
- Yeah.
- They're gonna rescue them, right?

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.295
Well, they said that when debris
ripped through the station,

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:43.839
it hit an ammonia pump.
Now the oxygen generators

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.550
and the carbon dioxide removal
system aren't working,

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.802
and the only way to turn them on
is from the outside.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.721
Their life support
is completely shut down?

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.848
Do they have reserves?
How much air do they have left?

01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:54.558
Certainly not
the seven hours they need.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.351
What you're saying
is the cosmonauts

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.145
won't survive until
the rescue ship arrives?

01:04:58.145 --> 01:04:59.354
I did the numbers.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:01.189
They'll arrive about half an hour

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.816
after the guys run out
of breathable air.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:05.110
- You mean--
- That's exactly what I mean.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.528
What are we gonna do about it?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.906
I have an idea, but I don't think
they'd believe a kid.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.033
Hey, whatever happened to,
"Let's win this"?

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:12.492
Who's stepping up now?

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:14.703
Come on.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.330
We've got astronauts to save.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.456
- Let's get moving.
- Let's go.

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:18.457
[car horn honks]

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:20.042
LACEY:
Never mind! Sorry!

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.961
Let me call you right back.

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.964
Guys, you're not supposed to be here.
Get back to the habitat.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:28.175
Captain Manley,
Jimmy has something to tell you.

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:29.593
Look, I don't have time for this,

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.720
and, Lacey, you are not
supposed to be here.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.888
Jimmy, you have to tell him.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.559
I know how we can save
the astronauts.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:41.021
Jimmy, the Soyuz will fix
the problem in seven hours.

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:43.440
Except the astronauts
will already be dead.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:47.486
[Sighs]

01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:52.032
You've got five minutes.

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.158
So the Marshall Space Center
up the road

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:56.495
has the most advanced mockup
of the Space Station ever constructed.

01:05:56.495 --> 01:05:59.706
We can save the astronauts in time
by using remote technology.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.417
We have everything
we need right here.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:05.295
We can connect to
and control robotic avatars

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.255
aboard the International
Space Station

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:10.384
and make the repairs using
specially designed motion-control suits

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:12.594
already designed
by NASA scientists.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.179
Rusty.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:17.766
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:21.478
If we can convince the astronauts
to enter a state of deep sleep,

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.647
allowing them to lower
their body temperatures

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.399
and therefore use less oxygen,

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:28.026
this will give them the extra time
they need to survive.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:33.615
Also, we will need to establish
a communications link with a satellite,

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.200
because all communications
have been rerouted

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.035
to Marshall
due to Hurricane Nancy.

01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:43.750
We can do this if we work together,
as a team.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.171
Well, I need to talk to someone.

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:51.466
Okay.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.676

I'm with the Commander now.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:59.057

is our only option.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.666

to have the Robonaut on the ship
