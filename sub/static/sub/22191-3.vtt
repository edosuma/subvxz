00:44.428 --> 00:46.319
As we stand here this morning,

00:46.325 --> 00:47.925
in an unknown galaxy,

00:47.931 --> 00:50.214
on the outer reaches
of the solar system,

00:50.303 --> 00:53.422
and I claim this planetoid,
rich in helium seven,

00:53.428 --> 00:55.973
on behalf of the Jupiter
Mining Corporation,

00:55.979 --> 00:59.890
it is only fitting we remember the
generations that came before us.

01:00.217 --> 01:02.887
It is to their memory, their greatness,

01:02.893 --> 01:05.367
their infinite,
glorious accomplishments,

01:05.373 --> 01:07.532
that I humbly name this moon...

01:07.632 --> 01:08.832
Rimmer.

01:10.744 --> 01:12.861
In the same spirit of benevolence,

01:12.867 --> 01:14.715
I've also graciously agreed to lend

01:14.721 --> 01:17.315
my name to the star this moon orbits,

01:17.321 --> 01:20.224
which from this moment
on shall be known as...

01:20.230 --> 01:21.530
Sunny Rim.

01:25.946 --> 01:27.151
Gentlemen,

01:27.224 --> 01:28.460
to Rimmer,

01:28.466 --> 01:30.663
a moon rich in helium seven,

01:30.669 --> 01:32.971
the most valuable gas in the universe.

01:33.038 --> 01:34.477
To Rimmer...

01:34.968 --> 01:36.648
so full of gas.

01:36.904 --> 01:38.514
Sirs, there appears to be

01:38.520 --> 01:41.121
<i>some kind of solar storm
coming in from the west.</i>

01:41.127 --> 01:42.832
<i>You should engage skedaddle mode.</i>

01:42.838 --> 01:44.819
But the helium seven,
we need to mine it.

01:44.825 --> 01:46.652
<i>There's no time, sir!</i>

01:47.106 --> 01:49.475
But helium seven's incredibly scarce.

01:49.481 --> 01:53.293
It's rarer than an un-groped
bottom at the BBC in the 1970s.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.959
It's worth a fortune.

01:55.965 --> 01:58.107
If we ever get back to
Earth, in the 23rd century,

01:58.113 --> 01:59.587
I'll get a finders' fee.

01:59.593 --> 02:01.416
One hour. That's all I'm asking.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.891
But can't you see?

02:02.897 --> 02:05.374
If you're hanging around here
when that storm's bringing,

02:05.380 --> 02:08.122
gonna get wiped! I'm begging you!

02:08.128 --> 02:09.620
Stay!

02:14.037 --> 02:17.450
I'll still be rich beyond my
wildest dreams just with this!

02:17.456 --> 02:19.461
Don't worry. I won't change.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.439
That's the tragedy of it.

02:30.263 --> 02:34.141
Check this. That's no solar
storm. What the hell is it?

02:34.147 --> 02:36.708
Looks like a big
wibbly-wobbly tidal wave thing,

02:36.714 --> 02:38.316
and it's heading straight for us!

02:38.401 --> 02:41.428
I want a full space corps-verified
diagnostic on that thing.

02:41.434 --> 02:43.599
- Already printing, sir.
- Well, what is it?

02:43.605 --> 02:47.198
It says, "It's a big
wibbly-wobbly tidal wave thing,

02:47.204 --> 02:49.011
and it's heading straight for us!"

02:50.411 --> 02:51.697
Here it comes!

02:56.589 --> 02:59.361
Woo! What the hell just happened?

02:59.367 --> 03:02.186
People have had acid trips that
have made more sense than that.

03:02.192 --> 03:04.690
I've had directions
from drunken Scotsmen

03:04.696 --> 03:06.301
that have made more sense than that.

03:07.144 --> 03:08.416
Any theories?

03:08.422 --> 03:11.994
I believe the ship may have
been hit by a temporal wash

03:12.000 --> 03:13.609
from a time wave, sir.

03:13.615 --> 03:16.111
It's been what, by a what, from a what?

03:16.117 --> 03:17.898
Well, much as a tsunami

03:17.904 --> 03:20.994
is caused by a large displacement
of water in the sea bed,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.775
a time wave is created by
an imploding black hole,

03:24.781 --> 03:28.639
causing space-time to contort
into a series of waves.

03:28.874 --> 03:33.157
Much as a what, causes a
what, into a series of whats?

03:33.163 --> 03:35.355
Now, when the wave moves forward,

03:35.361 --> 03:38.486
artefacts from the past can
be washed up into the present,

03:38.492 --> 03:40.317
and when the wave withdraws,

03:40.323 --> 03:43.618
artefacts from the present can
be swept back into the past.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.204
Sounds like a free ride out of
here. Show me where to stand.

03:46.210 --> 03:47.894
Ah, Sir, whoever is hit

03:47.900 --> 03:51.823
is likely to be swept into an
uninhabitable part of deep space.

03:51.829 --> 03:53.521
Quick, show him where to stand!

03:53.919 --> 03:56.439
We've got to avoid
this wave at all costs.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.119
- How long before the next one?
- Impossible to predict.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.732
So what do we do if this wave shows up?

04:00.738 --> 04:02.116
We'll have to outrun it.

04:02.122 --> 04:03.734
Well maybe if we lost some weight

04:03.740 --> 04:05.937
and jettisoned some unnecessary cargo?

04:05.943 --> 04:08.140
Go stand in the airlock
and leave the rest to me.

04:09.905 --> 04:12.110
Wait, check this in vector four.

04:12.116 --> 04:14.274
There's a ship just
shown up on the scans.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.965
The SS Enconium.

04:15.971 --> 04:17.988
They're from 24th-century Earth,

04:17.994 --> 04:21.177
and their ship possesses
a faster than light drive.

04:21.183 --> 04:22.383
Something's wrong.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.496
They're locked onto a crash course

04:24.502 --> 04:27.096
straight into the
heart of Planet Rimmer!

04:27.102 --> 04:29.112
Are you serious? That's terrible.

04:29.118 --> 04:30.809
Is Planet Rimmer gonna be okay?!

04:30.815 --> 04:33.901
The impact is likely
to cause an explosion,

04:33.907 --> 04:36.002
which could well
ignite the helium seven.

04:36.008 --> 04:37.497
And kill Planet Rimmer?

04:37.503 --> 04:39.964
And kill everything in this vicinity.

04:39.970 --> 04:41.171
Including Planet Rimmer?

04:41.177 --> 04:42.682
Including everything!

04:42.688 --> 04:44.877
We need to board that
ship and stop it crashing.

04:44.883 --> 04:46.461
And save Planet Rimmer.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.867
Save the crew.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.195
And Planet Rimmer.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.333
This mechanoid is reversing.

05:05.302 --> 05:07.093
This mechanoid is reversing.

05:10.580 --> 05:11.999
How long before we dock, Krytes?

05:12.005 --> 05:13.594
Well, in just thirty minutes, sir.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.491
So I thought now might be a good time

05:15.497 --> 05:18.285
to share the Intel I've
uncovered on the Enconium.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.886
It appears they have
some rather strange laws.

05:20.892 --> 05:22.092
Strange how?

05:22.098 --> 05:25.293
Well, on their ship,
criticism is illegal.

05:28.965 --> 05:32.172
A ship free of criticism,
what a place that must be.

05:32.308 --> 05:34.591
A world where no-one
is blamed or rebuked,

05:34.597 --> 05:36.491
and no-one gets mocked or ridiculed.

05:36.497 --> 05:39.270
That's what they say, but they'll
never hold out after they meet you.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.895
If you screw up and no-one
tells ya, what good's that?

05:42.901 --> 05:44.578
That's easy for you to say, Lister,

05:44.614 --> 05:47.090
but how would you feel if
you were ridiculed every day,

05:47.096 --> 05:48.989
wedgied every night, and sometimes

05:48.995 --> 05:51.780
even had your head shoved down
the toilet and the chain pulled?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.417
But we've stopped doing that now.

05:54.609 --> 05:57.522
Six years old, my parents had to
send me to a different prep school

05:57.528 --> 05:59.320
so I could get my confidence back.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.613
Games weren't competitive
at Saint Trembles.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.204
So what did you do on sports day?

06:05.210 --> 06:09.023
Sports day, 100 metres, you could
run in any direction you wanted,

06:09.029 --> 06:12.212
or paint a picture, or
stay at home and watch TV.

06:13.001 --> 06:16.525
And everyone got a "You're Really
Special" trophy and a party bag.

06:17.431 --> 06:18.923
Rimmer, you've gotta roll with it.

06:18.929 --> 06:21.626
You get knocked down, you get
back up again, and you slug it out.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.564
If I'd have got upset
with every bit of criticism

06:23.570 --> 06:25.262
I ever got, where do
you think I'd be now?

06:25.268 --> 06:26.663
Not single, not podgy,

06:26.669 --> 06:30.058
and probably not doomed to roam
deep space with a terrible haircut!

06:30.064 --> 06:31.775
Sirs! Please.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.655
When the board the Enconium,

06:33.661 --> 06:35.806
we must remember to respect their laws

06:35.812 --> 06:37.699
and not criticise each other.

06:37.705 --> 06:39.923
- How long we gotta hold out?
- Just an hour, sir.

06:39.929 --> 06:41.597
A whole hour? In that case,

06:41.603 --> 06:44.190
you better pack earplugs
and six rolls of duct tape.

06:44.697 --> 06:47.788
I wonder why the Enconium
made criticism illegal?

06:47.972 --> 06:50.083
Well, according to their data banks,

06:50.089 --> 06:51.988
they believe when people criticise,

06:51.994 --> 06:54.763
they feel esteem-inflating superiority,

06:54.769 --> 06:56.466
which causes the pleasure chemical

06:56.472 --> 06:58.294
dopamine to be released in the brain.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.500
And dopamine's bad?

06:59.506 --> 07:02.282
Too much dopamine is
like taking cocaine, sir.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.450
It over-excites the
receptors between brain cells,

07:05.456 --> 07:08.659
causing hyperactivity
and engorged self-worth.

07:08.665 --> 07:11.946
So people who criticise
get high on criticism?

07:11.952 --> 07:13.508
It seems they become addicted,

07:13.514 --> 07:15.596
needing to criticise more and more

07:15.602 --> 07:17.509
to produce the same original high.

07:17.515 --> 07:19.260
This explains so much!

07:19.425 --> 07:20.625
Junkie!

07:22.516 --> 07:24.345
But criticism can be good, can't it?

07:24.351 --> 07:27.054
I mean, it forces
people to become better.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.752
Well, not always, sir. I mean, take you.

07:31.638 --> 07:32.838
What about me?

07:32.844 --> 07:36.481
Well, as a guitarist, you've
been criticised, belittled,

07:36.487 --> 07:40.205
decried, vilified, panned,
and slammed your whole life!

07:40.211 --> 07:41.686
And your point is?

07:41.692 --> 07:44.094
You still utterly suck, sir!

07:46.074 --> 07:47.829
No, I don't!

07:47.835 --> 07:49.417
I mean, okay, fair play,

07:49.423 --> 07:51.917
back in the day, I was a
bit of a tone deaf plucker.

07:51.923 --> 07:54.213
But I took that criticism on board,

07:54.219 --> 07:57.329
and dedicated myself to
getting better. And now... ha!

07:57.335 --> 08:00.809
So long plucker, hello,
Davey Three Chords!

08:23.852 --> 08:26.230
"Joureny to the Stars".

08:26.236 --> 08:28.120
_

08:28.126 --> 08:29.737
Ah, look at that one.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.355
Have they got little
kids on board, as well?

08:32.924 --> 08:37.361
"By First Lieutenant Edward
Moore, age 34 and a half."

08:38.833 --> 08:41.501
So everything these guys
do, no matter how garbage,

08:41.508 --> 08:44.076
- gets to go on the wall?
- Just like at Saint Trembles.

08:44.593 --> 08:45.914
And the Tate Modern.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.105
The frames aren't even
straight. I hate that.

08:51.111 --> 08:52.534
Hey guys, check this.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.441
Howl at the moon!

08:54.447 --> 08:58.426
You will learn that we are
all part of the tree of life.

08:58.432 --> 09:00.124
And on the tree,

09:00.130 --> 09:02.772
you are a fruit!

09:03.342 --> 09:07.061
I am fruit, a lovely fruit,
let me play the flute!

09:12.639 --> 09:14.335
Let me remind you gentlemen,

09:14.341 --> 09:17.104
that what we're all thinking
right now is illegal here.

09:18.027 --> 09:19.912
My friends!

09:20.604 --> 09:23.228
Uh, duct tape on standby, sirs.

09:23.565 --> 09:28.246
Welcome to our ship. Now,
my name is Ziggy Briceman.

09:28.252 --> 09:31.356
Apologies for not returning
your handshake, but

09:31.362 --> 09:33.754
our communication
system is being repaired,

09:33.760 --> 09:36.702
and the hairdressers who are
carrying out the work haven't quite

09:36.708 --> 09:38.319
determined what's wrong yet.

09:38.325 --> 09:42.108
Oh, also our lifts are being
serviced by the catering department,

09:42.114 --> 09:44.773
so therefore; to the stairs!

09:44.779 --> 09:47.036
Wouldn't it be better if
your lifts were serviced

09:47.042 --> 09:48.478
by the lift service people?

09:48.484 --> 09:51.960
0h, unfortunately they're all
too busy working at the hospital,

09:51.966 --> 09:54.571
trying to figure out why
no-one's getting better.

09:55.672 --> 09:57.569
This way, my friends.

09:57.575 --> 09:59.279
I don't know if you're aware,

09:59.285 --> 10:02.169
but you've been washed up three
million years into deep space,

10:02.175 --> 10:05.473
and you're on a crash course
straight into a helium seven moon.

10:05.856 --> 10:09.084
I love your accent!

10:09.684 --> 10:13.403
It is cuter than a
kitten with a toilet roll.

10:14.473 --> 10:17.192
Now, let me take you along to our diner,

10:17.198 --> 10:20.117
and then I'm going to hunt
down our Captain, okay?

10:20.123 --> 10:21.526
This way!

10:23.213 --> 10:25.244
What the hell's he doing?

10:25.509 --> 10:28.159
At best guess, the Enconium crew

10:28.165 --> 10:32.189
are encouraged to express themselves
without fear of scorn or ridicule.

10:32.195 --> 10:34.775
Ha, bring back scorn and
ridicule, that's what I say.

10:34.781 --> 10:36.173
Sir, please.

10:36.179 --> 10:38.860
Didn't we talk about
respecting other cultures?

10:38.866 --> 10:41.150
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

10:59.721 --> 11:01.433
Hey bud, you should stick around,

11:01.439 --> 11:03.742
the Om Song could go platinum here.

11:07.044 --> 11:09.280
I love the atmosphere, it's so relaxing.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.878
No-one cares if you're
right or wrong, good or bad,

11:11.884 --> 11:13.108
maybe they're onto something.

11:13.114 --> 11:16.075
I mean, take me... back in the
day I mis-repaired a drive plate

11:16.081 --> 11:17.891
and killed over a thousand people.

11:17.897 --> 11:19.281
Now, in our culture,

11:19.287 --> 11:21.693
that sort of thing is
really frowned upon.

11:22.186 --> 11:24.508
But here, you just... move on.

11:24.514 --> 11:26.820
Ah! Here's your coffee, sir.

11:26.826 --> 11:29.711
- Be careful, it's very, very hot.
- Ahh!

11:29.717 --> 11:31.719
Ooh! Whoops-a-daisy.

11:32.355 --> 11:35.890
She's just broiled my love
spuds and doesn't even say sorry.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.393
She's moved on.

11:38.273 --> 11:39.687
Look at the state of me.

11:39.693 --> 11:41.475
Okay. Here we are.

11:41.481 --> 11:43.468
I have one processed sausage...

11:44.032 --> 11:45.618
with sprouts in a radish jus,

11:45.624 --> 11:48.104
and one warm goat salad.

11:48.415 --> 11:50.305
We didn't order any food.

11:50.311 --> 11:52.040
And we haven't ordered any drinks.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.797
Though I wouldn't mind ordering
a fresh pair of testicles

11:54.803 --> 11:56.223
'cause these two are ruined.

11:58.353 --> 11:59.716
Are you criticising me?

11:59.796 --> 12:04.100
No, no, no he's not criticising
you, I am. This food looks gross.

12:04.382 --> 12:06.473
Critics! Help!

12:06.479 --> 12:07.950
Let's get out of here.

12:07.956 --> 12:10.713
Easter Island head's right,
let's scoot while we still can.

12:10.719 --> 12:12.349
Yeah, come on. Back to Starbug.

12:12.355 --> 12:14.549
Nothing works here,
especially the people!

12:31.563 --> 12:32.881
Good evening, sir.

12:32.965 --> 12:34.292
Evening, officer.

12:34.298 --> 12:36.163
Do you know why I've
pulled you over, sir?

12:36.300 --> 12:38.404
No. No, haven't got a clue. No.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.383
Been doing any criticising
this evening, sir?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.091
Criticising? No, not at all, no.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.116
Well, it's just that we had a
report of some illegal castigation

12:47.122 --> 12:49.099
in the diner this evening, sir.

12:49.414 --> 12:50.930
What about you lads?

12:51.305 --> 12:54.426
- You been doing any criticising this evening?
- No, no.

12:55.313 --> 12:57.221
A little bit of chiding, perhaps?

12:57.227 --> 12:58.571
Chiding, no.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.460
- How about blaming, sir?
- No.

13:00.466 --> 13:03.083
- Harping? Little bit of panning?
- No.

13:03.089 --> 13:04.892
- Not even scoffing?
- Nothing.

13:04.898 --> 13:07.888
Wouldn't mind blowing into this
criticiser for me, then, will you sir?

13:08.657 --> 13:09.981
You what?

13:10.184 --> 13:12.412
Go on, blow as hard as you can.

13:18.287 --> 13:20.201
You got a readin' of 95, sir.

13:20.207 --> 13:22.316
Is that good? Bad? What does that mean?

13:22.322 --> 13:25.204
It means that your friend is way
over the criticism limit, sir.

13:25.322 --> 13:27.409
I may have to take him
down to the station.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.502
Now wait a minute!

13:29.508 --> 13:31.386
- You telling me to wait, sir?
- Well, yes.

13:31.392 --> 13:34.436
Implying that I am going too
fast and therefore criticising me?

13:34.442 --> 13:36.427
- Look...
- Are you telling me to look?!

13:37.434 --> 13:41.076
Insinuating that my attention isn't
focused in the correct direction?

13:41.145 --> 13:44.974
- Therefore implying that my focus...
- I am not criticising you, okay?

13:44.980 --> 13:48.279
Look, we're here to warn you that
your ship is on a collision course

13:48.285 --> 13:50.796
with a very important
moon called Planet Rimmer.

13:52.296 --> 13:54.178
I'm gonna let you off with a caution.

13:54.184 --> 13:55.389
Caution?!

13:55.733 --> 13:57.412
How dumb is this guy?

14:05.748 --> 14:06.948
Hey!

14:06.954 --> 14:08.994
Lieutenant Asshole,

14:11.993 --> 14:14.195
If you don't move your
dumb-ass spaceship,

14:14.201 --> 14:17.996
we're gonna be flatter than your
wife's droopy-ass titties, capisce?

15:10.987 --> 15:13.912
Wait a minute! Why have you
taken his straight-jacket off?!

15:13.918 --> 15:16.484
While he's in here, he's not
a danger to anyone, is he?

15:16.490 --> 15:17.917
Well, he is to us.

15:17.996 --> 15:19.694
No-one cares about you.

15:19.814 --> 15:23.305
Don't talk to him. Don't make eye
contact, pretend he's not here.

15:23.393 --> 15:25.502
All right, mate. How you doin'?

15:25.882 --> 15:28.499
I've been better. I'll tell you that.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.855
- How long you in for?
- Life.

15:35.058 --> 15:36.258
What for?

15:36.264 --> 15:37.464
Tutting.

15:39.436 --> 15:40.636
Tutting?

15:41.215 --> 15:43.108
They drove me to it!

15:44.806 --> 15:47.488
I'm in the queue. In the canteen...

15:47.494 --> 15:48.779
queuing.

15:49.104 --> 15:51.403
Finally, I get to the front,

15:51.409 --> 15:53.291
my turn to get served.

15:53.297 --> 15:54.556
And they say,

15:54.905 --> 15:57.737
"Sorry love, we've just closed."

15:57.907 --> 15:59.296
So I go...

16:03.217 --> 16:05.453
You just went "tut", and you got life?!

16:05.638 --> 16:08.884
I just called that cop "Lieutenant
Asshole" so what am I gonna get?!

16:09.566 --> 16:11.084
It don't bare thinkin' about.

16:11.090 --> 16:13.756
- They'll probably drain you!
- What's that?

16:13.762 --> 16:15.772
Not that I'm implying there's
anything wrong with draining.

16:15.778 --> 16:17.292
It's probably really lovely.

16:17.930 --> 16:19.532
What the hell are we gonna do?!

16:19.538 --> 16:21.021
We gotta get out of here,

16:21.027 --> 16:22.649
get to the engine room,

16:22.829 --> 16:24.719
and get this ship off the crash course.

16:24.725 --> 16:27.644
- And save Planet Rimmer.
- And save us!

16:27.828 --> 16:30.409
Uh, sir, may I borrow one of your boots?

16:30.415 --> 16:33.208
Kryten, my boots can't cause
diversions like they used to.

16:33.214 --> 16:35.121
He wears Odour Eaters now.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.547
I'm looking for a soil sample,
sir, from that moon this morning...

16:38.553 --> 16:39.829
The helium seven?

16:40.069 --> 16:42.628
Which I can then
fuse with the deuterium

16:42.634 --> 16:45.437
I have in my isotope
sample store in my arm,

16:45.443 --> 16:48.334
and create a small, contained explosion.

16:49.046 --> 16:52.211
Why do you collect isotope
samples and keep them in your arm?

16:52.217 --> 16:53.469
Well, why do you collect

16:53.475 --> 16:56.657
miniature Napoleonic soldiers
and keep them in your locker?

16:57.985 --> 16:59.185
You're weird.

16:59.191 --> 17:00.391
I'm weird?

17:00.568 --> 17:03.781
At least my isotope collection
could come in useful.

17:03.868 --> 17:05.303
Next time we're in a jam

17:05.309 --> 17:08.188
and one of your Sixth
Regiment trumpeters saves us,

17:08.194 --> 17:10.079
I'll eat my crevice brush.

17:11.078 --> 17:12.278
There.

17:12.888 --> 17:14.089
Excellent

17:25.194 --> 17:28.199
Here, boys, take me with you!

17:28.204 --> 17:30.751
I promise I'm no danger to
the outside world any more.

17:30.757 --> 17:32.279
I'll never tut again.

17:40.478 --> 17:41.944
Where are you taking us?

17:41.950 --> 17:44.524
Taking you to where all
the worst criticisers go.

17:45.038 --> 17:47.930
The backseat drivers, they're all there.

17:48.223 --> 17:52.030
Surely you can see society
without criticism is utterly...

17:52.036 --> 17:53.673
You don't know what it was like before.

17:53.926 --> 17:55.543
Ship was a shambles.

17:55.549 --> 17:57.011
Everyone arguing,

17:57.017 --> 17:59.015
constantly choosing new captains.

17:59.217 --> 18:02.723
So they brought in the anti-criticism
law to make people more tolerant.

18:03.100 --> 18:07.319
But any smegger can see that
society can't function like that

18:07.325 --> 18:09.164
Yeah, but once they outlawed criticism,

18:09.170 --> 18:11.244
nobody could criticise the criticism law

18:11.250 --> 18:13.269
because it was illegal to criticise!

18:13.431 --> 18:14.875
Idiots.

18:21.921 --> 18:24.132
I just criticised something, didn't I?

18:24.913 --> 18:28.846
Oh, God, I've not done that
for ages, that felt good!

18:29.742 --> 18:30.942
Oh!

18:32.225 --> 18:34.482
Criticising's great, isn't it?!

18:34.988 --> 18:36.820
Gives ya a real lift!

18:37.863 --> 18:40.084
I don't like your shoes, by the way.

18:40.090 --> 18:41.410
Ah!

18:42.597 --> 18:44.405
What's the story with his head?

18:44.806 --> 18:46.509
Looks like something from that TV show,

18:46.515 --> 18:48.642
"When Circumcisions Go Wrong"!

18:51.189 --> 18:53.021
Look, you've gotta help us.

18:53.027 --> 18:56.531
If you don't get your ship off
this crash course, we're all dead.

18:56.537 --> 18:57.833
Well, the bridge is that way.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.453
I'll pretend you escaped.

18:59.459 --> 19:00.835
Won't you get in trouble?

19:00.841 --> 19:03.536
How? Nobody can criticise you here.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.733
Now get going before somebody comes.

19:06.106 --> 19:09.133
Oh, and by the way, you are way
too old to be wearing leather pants.

19:09.736 --> 19:12.447
Nobody move! Please.

19:12.453 --> 19:15.856
Did you help them? Did
you betray us, did you?

19:15.862 --> 19:17.970
Yeah, I did, Ziggy.

19:18.548 --> 19:19.946
I betrayed this badge.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.357
I made this uniform, quite frankly...

19:23.010 --> 19:24.904
an object of ridicule.

19:29.909 --> 19:33.737
Well there is no shame in making
mistakes, officer. You may go.

19:34.321 --> 19:36.324
To our visitors...

19:36.424 --> 19:39.745
we need to drain them.

19:43.522 --> 19:45.097
_

19:46.729 --> 19:48.942
Now, we are going to drain you

19:48.948 --> 19:51.036
of all your critical faculties

19:51.042 --> 19:52.637
by removing your inner critic;

19:52.643 --> 19:54.632
that little voice in
your head that stops

19:54.638 --> 19:56.626
you achieving your full potential.

19:56.632 --> 19:59.461
Now you will no longer
turn down opportunities

19:59.467 --> 20:01.645
for fear of failure or humiliation.

20:01.651 --> 20:04.338
You will only feel love for all things.

20:04.344 --> 20:06.046
They're gonna turn us into hippies.

20:06.843 --> 20:09.453
I'm gonna wind up like
that crazy guy on the flute.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.737
Oh, that was Derek.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.648
He used to be a theatre critic.

20:13.843 --> 20:16.972
Oh, he's come so far. Look.

20:18.659 --> 20:21.252
- That's his inner critic.
- Oh, my God!

20:21.258 --> 20:23.844
What's he turned into without me?!

20:23.850 --> 20:26.967
Whatever it is, he's
useless! He'll fail!

20:26.973 --> 20:28.963
He's talentless!

20:30.337 --> 20:31.768
Leave this to me.

20:32.236 --> 20:34.676
As Stand-in Senior
Acting Commanding Officer

20:34.682 --> 20:37.202
of the J.M.C. mining ship Red Dwarf,

20:37.208 --> 20:39.209
and protected as I am,

20:39.215 --> 20:43.897
under Space Corps directive
381-286, Kryten shut up,

20:47.541 --> 20:50.253
I demand that you release
us all immediately,

20:50.259 --> 20:52.759
or at least one of us,
as a gesture of goodwill,

20:52.765 --> 20:54.548
for which I'd like to volunteer.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.541
My friend, you have nothing to fear.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.376
Your happiness awaits,
and you shall be the first.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.388
Let's bottle your inner critic.

21:05.290 --> 21:09.580
Now, let your critical
observations flow forth.

21:09.586 --> 21:12.784
You mean I could end up loving my
parents, and admiring my brothers?

21:12.790 --> 21:16.369
You'll have nothing to remain
dead for! Resist, sir. Resist!

21:16.375 --> 21:19.269
If they remove your inner
critic, you'll be changed forever.

21:19.275 --> 21:20.677
Changed forever?!

21:20.948 --> 21:22.354
Listen to him!

21:22.979 --> 21:27.375
My parents were lovely, wise,
thoughtful, and supportive.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.216
Argh!

21:29.285 --> 21:32.420
Aww! I achieved all my dreams,

21:32.598 --> 21:35.472
- and I'm admired and respected.
- Don't fight it.

21:35.478 --> 21:37.957
Think of your childhood,
were you're happy?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.066
I was so happy!

21:41.246 --> 21:43.453
I can't hold out much longer!

21:44.742 --> 21:46.148
Argh!

21:46.351 --> 21:49.183
My brother, Howard,
was an utter bastard!

21:50.579 --> 21:53.371
As for my parents and the
schools they sent me to,

21:53.377 --> 21:56.829
the exams I've failed, and
the support I never got, and...

21:56.835 --> 22:00.167
why Yvonne McGruder never wanted
to go on a second date with me,

22:00.173 --> 22:02.953
and my sex life was
an absolute shambles;

22:03.064 --> 22:04.754
ever since that day at school

22:04.760 --> 22:07.068
my brother gave me sex advice,

22:07.074 --> 22:09.784
he said the most important
thing was the clitoris,

22:09.901 --> 22:11.205
and I thought what he said was,

22:11.211 --> 22:13.792
"The most important thing
was to spit on her wrist!"

22:16.416 --> 22:18.586
Oh, the looks I used to get.

22:18.592 --> 22:20.819
Wait... slow down.
You... you're criticising

22:20.825 --> 22:22.665
faster than the extractor can cope.

22:22.671 --> 22:24.045
I've hardly started!

22:24.051 --> 22:27.043
Oh, you... your inner
critic's too powerful!

22:27.049 --> 22:29.351
The... the extractor can't process it.

22:29.357 --> 22:31.031
Well, why can't it process it?!

22:31.037 --> 22:32.398
Cheap, damned, Minervan,

22:32.404 --> 22:34.535
negative-energy, inner
critic bottling machines!

22:34.541 --> 22:37.666
Will ya stop criticising! Ooh!

22:42.641 --> 22:44.042
What the hell's that?!

22:46.995 --> 22:49.096
I'm Rimmer's inner critic,

22:49.299 --> 22:51.395
I'm the voice inside
his head that reminds him

22:51.401 --> 22:54.613
he's an idle, good-for-nothing,
under-achieving idiot,

22:54.619 --> 22:58.017
who surrounds himself with cretins
to mask his own inadequacies.

22:58.023 --> 23:00.907
He hangs 'round with
other guys, besides us?

23:01.416 --> 23:04.114
Tell it to go away. Tell
it to leave me alone.

23:04.509 --> 23:05.798
You need me.

23:06.162 --> 23:07.529
I protect you.

23:08.309 --> 23:10.662
Remember the school talent contest?

23:10.942 --> 23:12.522
Twelve years old;

23:12.729 --> 23:15.655
you wanted to Morris dance
in front of the entire school.

23:16.421 --> 23:18.433
And you made me chicken out.

23:18.535 --> 23:20.715
We'd have been humiliated!

23:20.721 --> 23:23.192
Same with all those women
I wanted ask out on dates,

23:23.198 --> 23:24.917
you claimed where out of my league.

23:24.923 --> 23:26.427
Of course I did.

23:26.484 --> 23:29.201
Ann Marie was a solid four out of ten.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.484
We're lucky to get threes!

23:31.490 --> 23:34.689
I hate you. You've never
let me take any risks, ever!

23:34.695 --> 23:37.181
I stop you from making
a fool of yourself.

23:37.187 --> 23:38.978
But he's always making
a fool of himself.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.681
Yeah. He is always
making a fool of himself.

23:41.687 --> 23:44.681
So hang on, you're not doing
a very good job, are ya?

23:45.601 --> 23:48.765
You can't criticise me.
I'm his inner critic!

23:48.771 --> 23:51.484
Where were you when Rimmer
was fixing that drive plate,

23:51.490 --> 23:54.059
- wiped out the crew?
- No-one criticises me!

23:54.065 --> 23:55.856
Why didn't you tell
him he wasn't up to it?

23:55.862 --> 23:57.857
I mean, aren't you
supposed to protect him?

23:57.863 --> 24:01.414
- Well, yes, I suppose I...
- So, you failed.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.604
Well...

24:03.768 --> 24:05.195
that's not fair.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.540
I possibly didn't achieve
all the goals I set out to.

24:08.546 --> 24:11.366
You're right. It failed!

24:11.452 --> 24:14.576
That's a bit strong,
I didn't fully succeed.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.374
- It failed.
- Failed?

24:16.566 --> 24:19.285
- I can't believe you just said that,
- It failed.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.675
- That's really horrible.
- It failed!

24:21.681 --> 24:23.111
Oh!

24:24.539 --> 24:26.742
- Is it dead?
- Just wounded.

24:26.748 --> 24:28.844
It'll be back one day. Trust me.

24:28.850 --> 24:30.423
Oof!

24:31.524 --> 24:36.576
You achieved a positive end by
using criticism to vanquish a foe!

24:36.582 --> 24:39.783
Because you can't tar all
criticism with one brush.

24:39.789 --> 24:43.877
Yes, I see that now. Perhaps
our philosophy is flawed.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.166
Are you criticising your own philosophy?

24:46.172 --> 24:48.278
I suppose I am.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.721
Wait!

24:50.595 --> 24:54.033
Call together all the
members of the high chamber.

24:54.220 --> 24:58.445
And warn them that I've repealed
the law against criticism.

24:58.451 --> 25:00.087
From this moment on,

25:00.093 --> 25:04.285
everybody can criticise
without fear of penalty.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.102
Release them!

25:09.422 --> 25:10.936
What about Planet Rimmer?

25:10.942 --> 25:13.001
The ship is on a crash descent course

25:13.007 --> 25:15.828
and your engineering department don't
know what the hell they're doing!

25:15.834 --> 25:17.335
We need to get to the engine room.

25:17.341 --> 25:20.806
No need. I'll request our engineers
simply return to their jobs,

25:20.812 --> 25:24.726
and then we'll be out of here in a
brief contraction of forward space.

25:32.653 --> 25:36.220
I've been racking my brains
as to how I could thank you

25:36.226 --> 25:37.939
for showing me a new way to live.

25:37.945 --> 25:41.314
Now my first thought was,
We could upgrade your mech.

25:41.439 --> 25:44.634
Then I thought... No. No,
it's not special enough.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.598
Then I thought, we could
upgrade Red Dwarf's engine,

25:47.604 --> 25:49.503
Uh, make it FTL?

25:49.509 --> 25:52.957
But again I thought... No,
it's not special enough.

25:52.963 --> 25:56.258
I wanted to give you something
that would truly show you

25:56.264 --> 25:58.506
the depth of my gratitude.

25:59.403 --> 26:00.603
For you.

26:00.743 --> 26:02.677
It's my finest work.

26:07.431 --> 26:09.862
Look, don't take this
the wrong way, but, erm...

26:09.868 --> 26:11.775
it's not that good, to be honest.

26:11.781 --> 26:13.323
I repeal the law!

26:13.503 --> 26:15.509
Critics! I need help here.

26:15.515 --> 26:18.594
Drain them! Drain them all!!!
