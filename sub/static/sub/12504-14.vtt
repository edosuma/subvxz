[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.608 --> 00:09.810
Winning requires focus.
Payson understood that.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.214
- I'm sorry I'm not Payson.
- [Lauren] You're the gymnastics
power couple now.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.549
- Do you think
they've hooked up yet?
- [Nicky] I'm not loving being

00:15.583 --> 00:18.452
paired up with her. She's
not even a serious gymnast.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.488
I promise to have nothing
to do with Carter.

00:20.521 --> 00:24.192
- I'm sorry I'm still here.
- I told you,
stay as long as you want.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.493
[Emily] I don't
feel like a star.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.494
- Are you anybody?
- No.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.063
I had to train at a lot
of hole-in-the-wall gyms

00:29.097 --> 00:30.598
before I got a shot at The Rock.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.534
There's something so right about
me and you being number one.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.469
Your condition is inoperable.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.448
* It's bringing you down

00:47.481 --> 00:50.284
* It's tearing you down

00:52.253 --> 00:55.623
* You want it like it was

00:55.656 --> 00:58.459
* Your life is stuck on pause

00:58.492 --> 01:01.362
* You gotta move on

01:01.395 --> 01:03.497
* Yeah, you gotta move on

01:03.531 --> 01:06.600
She's not exactly thrilled.
But this isn't just
about her education.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.837
It's about getting her out of
the house and on with her life.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.641
Payson Keeler,
I have your number one fan
calling from St. Paul.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.110
Go ahead, caller.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.179
Hey, Dad.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.515
No, I am thrilled about my
first day of high school.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.584
Every day of my life, while
I was training for the Olympics,

01:23.617 --> 01:27.521
I was really dreaming
about spitballs and fart jokes
and pep rallies. And now?

01:27.555 --> 01:31.492
Whoo! All mine.
I can hardly believe it.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.530
Hey, we don't want to be late,
so can we call you tonight?

01:36.564 --> 01:39.300
- Yeah, fingers crossed.
- [phone beeps]

01:39.333 --> 01:41.469
You know, you might
just like high school.

01:41.502 --> 01:47.141
There are so many activities
and clubs nowadays.
I saw your orientation packet.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.543
There's Fashion Club
and Scuba Club.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.245
There's only
one thing I want to do.
You know that.

01:51.279 --> 01:55.349
There's only one thing you
want to do because there's
only one thing you've ever done.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.519
I am not joining any clubs,
I'm not signing up
for any activities.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.889
I am only going to high school
because you're making me.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.493
Listen, Payson.
You're not gonna like this,

02:05.526 --> 02:10.564
but I'm not gonna
let you sit on my couch
for the rest of your life.

02:10.598 --> 02:14.535
- You can stop
rolling your eyes.
- I'll be in the car.

- * What, what?
- [music stops]

02:24.245 --> 02:27.548
You want my dad to find out
you're living up here?
Relax.

02:27.581 --> 02:31.385
- I've seen you naked,
remember?
- That night ruined my life.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.488
- How could I forget?
- Wow. Your
gratitude is touching.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.691
If not for me, you and your
dope beats would be rollin'
homeless right now.

02:37.725 --> 02:41.595
- Is this your laundry?
- You don't have
to do my laundry.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.197
I'll be out of here
in a day or two.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.699
Look, we both know you
have nowhere else to go.

02:45.733 --> 02:49.203
I don't need your dirty clothes
stinking up the place.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.206
Why are you doing this?
You know I still love Kaylie.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.476
[scoffs] The whole gym knows
you still love Kaylie.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
You follow her around
like a little puppy dog.

02:57.545 --> 03:01.382
- I don't follow her.
- Mm. Right.
See you at The Rock.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.520
- Ah! [laughs]
- What are you squealing about?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.690
- I looked you up online!
- Don't tell me.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.426
- The page is blank?
- Hardly!

03:12.460 --> 03:15.563
You are a cyberspace
superstar! Look!

03:17.798 --> 03:21.502
- [Emily] Oh, my God.
- Look, all these people
are talking about you.

03:21.535 --> 03:27.441
According to Gymrat84,
Emily Kmetko is a
true Olympic contender.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.443
- Seriously?
- Yeah, read for yourself.

Kmetko made the National Team.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.785
- Awesome."
- OK. Wait.
This is a camcorder moment.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.389
Where did it go? OK.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.524

- OK. Go.

It's just another angry blogger
wannabe. The net is full of 'em.

Yeah, honey, it's one
bitter person's opinion.

04:12.052 --> 04:16.824
That apparently some
other bloggers agree with.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.827
Honey, you're not upset
about all this, are you?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.730
No.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.567
If I'm gonna be
a pro athlete, I can't
let this stuff get to me.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.470
I'm just not gonna
give it a second thought.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.575
- Time to get to work.
- Bye!

- Yeah, right back at'cha.
- I'm training. You're texting.

Unless speed tweeting has
a new level of difficulty.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.072
- I was at a meeting
with our agent.
- Right.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.609
Imagine if you focused
as much on improving yourself

05:08.642 --> 05:10.844
as you do selling yourself.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.715
What?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.887
Nicky Russo is such
an arrogant ass!

05:19.920 --> 05:23.791
He's like a splinter
in stirrup pants. I hate him.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.528

there's a fine line
between love and hate.

and silver medalists be a power

05:39.907 --> 05:41.542
I hope Payson
doesn't see that.

Oh, my God, that's right!

- Today's her first day.
- Yeah. I wonder how it's going.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.519
Let's see, she's been
homeschooled since
the sixth grade.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.688
She has no friends,
she's starting mid-year
and she's wearing a back brace.

- How do you think it's going?
- [bell rings]

- Uh, yeah.
- Great! I hope you'll
join the Astronomy Club.

Oh, wrong flyer.
That one's for Jr. Inventors.

If you're worried
about wasting paper, don't.

this Saturday is the annual
Rock Open House Exhibition.

- Do National Team Members
have to be a part of...?
- Yes, they do.

07:19.006 --> 07:23.477
- Shouldn't we be saving
ourselves for competition?
- She's right. What's the point?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
[Sasha] The point is
to support your club.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.615
The club which made you all
the "superstars" you are today.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.652
And to inspire young kids,
as you were once inspired.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.721
You each have special talents,

07:33.754 --> 07:36.724
and I expect to see them
all on display this Saturday.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.692
Thank you for your precious time
and attention.

I can't believe Nicky
actually agreed with me.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.536
- I smell love in the air.
- I'm over love.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.704
- Thanks to you.
- Hey, I thought
we were friends again.

07:50.738 --> 07:54.608
Just because I forgave
doesn't mean I forgot.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.786
Knock, knock.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.055
- Please tell me you're back.
- I'm just visiting.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.758
- How's Summer working out?
- Oh, she's great.

08:10.791 --> 08:15.596
So organized and efficient.
Did you know there's
such a thing as a label gun?

08:15.629 --> 08:19.032
- I've heard tell.
- How's Payson?

08:19.066 --> 08:22.803
Well, besides hating us for
making her go to high school?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.838
She'll adjust.
She's a survivor.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.641
I don't want her to survive.
I want her to thrive.

08:27.675 --> 08:32.780
I want her to have fun
and discover something else
to live for besides gymnastics.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.549
Hey, Kim. I'm glad you're here.
I just picked up the fliers

08:35.583 --> 08:39.753
- for the annual open house.
- [Kim] Oh, that's right.
It's recruitment time.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.290
There is a community billboard
on Third Street that
gets a lot of eyeballs.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.994
- I was planning
on attacking it virally.
- That sounds scary.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.831
I got us a new web address.
The old one kept getting
lost in the shuffle,

08:50.864 --> 08:54.101
but the new one tops
all the search engines
and makes us easier to find.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.705
I don't know what that means,
but I do know that a lot
of moms shop at that market.

08:57.738 --> 09:02.710
You know, with Payson
in school, I have a lot of time.
I could help you if you need it.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.712
Of course!
Yeah, this'll be fun.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.681
Not according to our elite
gymnasts who think
the open house is a chore.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.850
Well, if they're not having fun,
no one else will.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.587
Sometimes, I think we let
them get so medal driven,

09:13.621 --> 09:17.658
they forget why they love
gymnastics in the first place.
Payson never forgot that.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.594
She always loved sharing
her love of the sport.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.697
That's what the open house
should be all about.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.134
You're right.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.737
[rock music plays]

09:33.674 --> 09:37.745
Hey, again. I was in such
a frenzy this morning,
I didn't even get your name.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.880
- My bad.
- Payson.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.116
So, what about the Astronomy
Club? I also do debate and
the a cappella group

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
you know, just for fun.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.921
Joining clubs is a great way
to meet people if you're new.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.657
- [whistle blows]
- [woman] OK, listen up!

09:49.690 --> 09:53.126
Everyone line up on the corner
of the mat for tumbling passes!

09:53.160 --> 09:55.863
That means you,
Little Miss Sunshine.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.699
Right. Sorry, Mrs. C.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.902
[Mrs. C.] Oh...

10:03.203 --> 10:06.840
Payson Keeler.
My daughter is your biggest fan.

10:06.874 --> 10:10.944
And you're here at
a great time. Today is
our last day of tumbling.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.080
Tomorrow,
we start square dance.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.783
[girl] Mrs. Cirelli?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.751
Permission to do
a round-off back handspring?

10:17.785 --> 10:21.789
I'm getting one ready for the
ESPN Cheerleading Championships.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.731
- [applause]
- Awesome, Morgan.

- You rock, Morgan!
- [blows whistle]

10:33.767 --> 10:38.772
Class, we have the privilege
of having someone
very special with us.

10:38.806 --> 10:42.175
Raise your hand, Payson.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.445
Now, I bet you have
some tips for Morgan?

10:45.478 --> 10:49.016
Uh, no...

10:49.049 --> 10:51.752
- ...ma'am.
- I kind of doubt that.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.054
Come on, Payson.
What did Morgan do wrong?

10:58.792 --> 11:02.229
If she keeps her hands
closer to her ears,

11:02.262 --> 11:05.966
after her round-off,
it'll be easier for her to push
off for the back handspring.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.669
Did you hear that, Morgan?
Speak up, Payson, tell her.

11:11.204 --> 11:15.976
Keep your hands tighter to your
ears and you'll land clean.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.444
[Mrs. Cirelli] Fabulous!

11:17.477 --> 11:20.814
If you don't know who Payson is,
rest assured,

11:20.848 --> 11:23.884
she knows a thing
or two about tumbling.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.225
Ladies, I just got
tumbling advice from
a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.127
- [laughing]
- Forget it.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.764
No, no. Thank you.
Now, if only I could get

tutor me in speech.

12:18.238 --> 12:22.776
and what to wear to the next
school-sponsored social event.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.112
You seem independent
of that superficial stuff.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.315
So, what are you doing
in the girls PE class?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.550
Oh, I'm cutting
the boy's PE class.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.319
You know,
not a fan of dodge ball.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.088
Or really anything that
involves hitting or throwing

12:35.122 --> 12:37.858
or catching a ball.
I mean, what are we?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.893
Golden retrievers?

12:40.560 --> 12:43.831
Mr. Benziger!
You do not belong here.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.933
Truer words
were never spoken.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.937
You don't look like
you belong here either.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.005
[whistle blows]

12:57.978 --> 13:00.981
[rock music plays]

13:06.286 --> 13:08.321
This is not my day.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.290
You OK?

13:10.323 --> 13:13.560
Yeah, fine,
just a little distracted.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.563
[laughs] I hear you.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.133
Listen, you have a job
at Pizza Shack, right?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.870
Yeah, but I'm
not supposed to.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.005
Do you know
if they're hiring?

13:25.038 --> 13:27.074
They're always hiring.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.878
I could put in a word
for you, if you want.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.846
- That would be great.
- [Sasha] OK, listen up!

13:32.880 --> 13:35.949
The theme for this year's
Open House Exhibition

13:35.983 --> 13:39.619
is going to be "Fun."
That's right, F-U-N.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.189
I want you all to rediscover
the joy of the sport.

13:42.222 --> 13:48.095
So no rules. Anything goes.
Costumes, music, comedy, drama,

13:48.128 --> 13:51.331
tell a story, I don't care,
as long as you're having fun.

13:51.364 --> 13:56.403
And since competition
seems to be the only thing
that motivates you people,

13:56.436 --> 13:59.206
who knows what this is?

13:59.239 --> 14:04.211
Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?

14:04.244 --> 14:06.914
- [laughter]
- It's an applause-o-meter.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.116
Whoever delights
the audience most wins.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.419
And remember, the key
to delighting the audience
is to delight yourselves.

14:12.452 --> 14:16.623
Oh, and since we have

14:16.656 --> 14:20.994
two National stars
and apparent power couple,
Kaylie and Nicky,

14:21.028 --> 14:25.933
or "Kalicky," you two
will be performing a feat

14:25.966 --> 14:30.370
never seen before in this,
or any other gym: a duet.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.239
Won't that be fun?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.123
[rock music plays]

14:54.294 --> 14:55.963
Damn it!

14:55.996 --> 14:57.998
[Sasha] Whoa! Emily.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.267
- It's fine. I'm doing it again.
- Not like that you're not.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.336
You're scattered. Did you
leave your focus at home today?

15:03.370 --> 15:06.339
No. I don't know.
I'm just a little annoyed.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.378
What's the problem?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.948
It seems that some people...

15:14.982 --> 15:16.316
...a lot of people, actually,

15:16.349 --> 15:19.319
think that I don't
have the right background
to be an elite gymnast.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.488
But don't worry.
I'm gonna prove them wrong.

15:21.521 --> 15:25.292
- What kind of people?
- Internet people.

15:25.325 --> 15:29.362
Uh-huh. Emily, you know better
than to read that stuff.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.099
No. I don't pay
attention to it.
I just accidentally...

15:32.132 --> 15:34.367
Emily, if you think you
need to prove them wrong,

15:34.401 --> 15:37.170
then it means you currently
think they're right.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.471
That's your real problem.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.981
[rock music plays]

15:50.017 --> 15:52.152
[Heather] Payson Keeler?

15:52.185 --> 15:54.121
'08 National Silver Medalist!

15:54.154 --> 15:56.356
I Googled you. Wow!

15:56.389 --> 15:59.326
- You're, like,
a superstar gymnast!
- Was.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.362
I'd appreciate
if you didn't tell anybody.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.133
So new girl
with the back brace.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.768
Love your exo-skeleton.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.505
No, obviously, you think you
can do a better round-off
back handspring than me.

16:12.539 --> 16:17.144
- Why don't you show everyone?
- [Lauren] Why don't we?

16:17.177 --> 16:19.312
- You guys, it's OK.
- [Lauren] Let's see.

16:19.346 --> 16:23.216
A round-off back handspring.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.352
That sounds really hard.

16:25.385 --> 16:29.222
But not as hard as a round-off
back handspring layout step-out.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.170
[applause]

16:53.213 --> 16:56.316
So back brace girl
has carnie friends.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.452
And bitch girl's
got buck teeth.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.289
- Don't mess with our friend.
- All right.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.257
[Kaylie] Come on, Pay.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.799
Are you gonna escort me
to school every day?

17:12.832 --> 17:15.335
Sit in class, walk me
through the lunch line?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.205
You guys don't know anything
about the real world.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.574
I'm sorry, Pay. We didn't mean
to mess things up for you.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.212
So tell us everything.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.247
Tell us about classes
and lunch room.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.482
And high school boys.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.219
Oh! There's a boy!

17:32.252 --> 17:34.087
- Spill, Pay.
- No, no, no.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.622
- [laughing]
- There's nothing to tell.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.292
So, what's up at The Rock?

17:39.326 --> 17:42.862
Well, Sasha decided to make
Open House fun this year.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.666
Kaylie and Nicky are doing
a floor routine together.
You're still coming, aren't you?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.238
- Yeah, of course.
- Sasha's making us do it.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.507
It's a good idea. You're the
gold and silver medalists.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.309
Little girls
will love it.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.479
Yeah, it's just
Nicky's kind of a jerk.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.649
- [Kaylie] No offense.
- Why would I be offended?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.285
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Right. Why would
she want Nicky

18:05.318 --> 18:07.520
when she has cute high
school boys to choose from?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.522
Besides, he'll
remind you of gymnastics.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.192
And what do you
think we remind her of?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.495
I should go.
I have homework.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.365
Sure. OK.

18:22.369 --> 18:26.339
Look, um, I was the new girl
at three different schools

18:26.373 --> 18:28.241
before I was the
new girl at The Rock.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.278
If it's any consolation,
I know exactly what
you're going through.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.547
No offense, Emily,

18:34.581 --> 18:37.317
but, you don't.

18:37.350 --> 18:41.288
Being the new girl may suck,
but at least you
still have gymnastics.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
I don't have anything.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.695
That was nice of the girls
to pick you up today.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.399
- Were you surprised?
- Can you just pick me up
from now on?

18:52.432 --> 18:56.169
- Why?
- Because they embarrassed me.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.338
- How?
- Well, OK.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.707
Today, I was a freak
in a back brace.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.410
Thanks to them, tomorrow
I'll be a freak in a back brace

19:03.443 --> 19:06.279
catching hell from
some cheerleader because
my friends snubbed her

19:06.313 --> 19:08.348
with an elite
level tumbling pass.

19:08.381 --> 19:13.553
Payson, there's gonna
be mean girls and boys
anywhere you go.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.190
But they're the exception,
not the rule.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.559
There's plenty of nice
kids in high school.

19:19.592 --> 19:23.963
Can you please just stop
trying to make me normal?

19:23.996 --> 19:28.368
Payson, there's nothing
normal about you.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.203
I gave birth
to a bullet train.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.340
- You can do anything
you set your mind to.
- No, I can't!

19:33.373 --> 19:36.443
So just stop already!
I can't be her!

19:36.476 --> 19:40.313
- Be who?
- The normal daughter
you always wanted.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.283
The daughter you can relate to.
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

19:43.316 --> 19:48.221
but I am not gonna be
president of the Scuba Club
or of any other club.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.657
I hate high school and I
hate you for making me go!

19:53.260 --> 19:54.794
Good times.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.404
[beeping]

20:23.590 --> 20:26.259
Step away from the device.

20:26.293 --> 20:30.397
How can I have a fair shot
when they're all judging
me on my background?

20:30.430 --> 20:33.566
- So? What's new?
- I'm a Rock girl now.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.337
- I just wish they'd
forget about my past.
- [beeping]

20:37.370 --> 20:40.473
What was that?
Oh, did someone make popcorn?

20:40.507 --> 20:43.676
She set an alert so that
every time her name comes up,
she'll be notified.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.314
Well, I suppose
that might be helpful.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.317
- Sure. Nurture the obsession.
- It's not an obsession.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.320
I haven't even met
trophyhound206,

20:53.353 --> 20:55.822
- and she's calling
me "unrefined."
- All right!

20:55.855 --> 20:58.425
Let's talk about
open house ideas.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.294
I heard about
the big "Fun-Off".
Do you have your routine ready?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.430
Not even close.

21:03.463 --> 21:07.434
Um... Do you remember
when I cocktailed

21:07.467 --> 21:09.369
at that pirate bar in Vegas?

21:09.402 --> 21:12.439
I still have my eye patch
and my thigh highs.

21:12.472 --> 21:16.343
And I wonder why they
call me "unrefined."

21:17.344 --> 21:19.646
[rock music plays]

21:31.090 --> 21:33.493
- What the hell was that?
- It's called
a front handspring rudi.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.363
I know what's it called.
You almost decapitated me.

21:36.396 --> 21:40.066
- Sorry, but you're
just standing there.
- Thinking. Of a routine.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.736
While you're just charging
around like a stupid bull.

21:43.770 --> 21:47.740
Look, why don't you just
do your thing and I'll do mine.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.477
And that's
your idea of a duet?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.748
[Morgan] Hey, Payson.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.385
Listen, we got off on the
wrong foot the other day,

21:58.418 --> 22:00.653
and I just wanted to say
welcome to Taft High School,

22:00.687 --> 22:03.423
- the best school in Boulder.
- OK.

22:03.456 --> 22:07.560
- And I hope we can be friends.
- OK.

22:07.594 --> 22:11.464
Listen, do you mind if we
take a quick picture with you?

22:12.399 --> 22:15.635
Yeah, she can't.
She's camera shy.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.407
Ike, you are
such a party pooper!

22:20.440 --> 22:23.410
Uh-huh. It's a
cheerleading hazing ritual.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.546
Whoever gets a picture
with the most pathetic
girl in school wins.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.516
Oh, come on,
it could be worse.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.485
You could be so pathetic
and insecure that you
did crap like that

22:32.519 --> 22:34.153
to make yourself feel better.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.155
What did I do
to deserve this?

22:36.188 --> 22:41.461
Again! You're reading my mind.
It's uncanny.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.431
What did we do
to deserve this?

22:47.434 --> 22:50.937
- Let's ditch.
- Ditch?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.605
You know, cut class.

22:52.639 --> 22:56.443
- Isn't that against the rules?
- The rules of this place?

22:56.476 --> 22:59.412
[laughs] Who cares?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.416
[bell rings]

23:11.524 --> 23:12.959
[Payson] Ditching
is kind of fun.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.794
And we don't get
in trouble for this?

23:14.827 --> 23:16.228
[Ike] You know,
it's a numbers game.

23:16.262 --> 23:19.632
What's the worst that
could happen? They stick
you in detention? Ooh!

23:19.666 --> 23:22.735
I just don't
do stuff like this.

23:22.769 --> 23:26.506
- It's weird.
- Break rules?

23:26.539 --> 23:30.577
No. In, uh, my last life,
I loved the rules,

23:30.610 --> 23:35.214
the rules supported my goal.
And now, I don't have a goal.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.618
Also, in my other life, I
couldn't have one of these.

23:38.651 --> 23:42.455
- Wait. Like, ever?
- Nope.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.591
Well...

23:44.624 --> 23:48.194
So, um, those girls that
picked you up yesterday?

23:48.227 --> 23:50.597
You were one of them?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.565
Is that how you
hurt your back?

23:52.599 --> 23:55.001
And ended my career.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.605
Now, that's weird.
You're what?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.607
Sixteen? And you've
already had a career?

24:00.640 --> 24:05.512
For women, a gymnastics career
only lasts from maybe 14 to 20.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.579
Oh, brutal.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.718
So, what's your thing?

24:11.751 --> 24:14.821
Um... this.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.758
- This?
- This.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.060
You know, I hang out.

24:22.795 --> 24:28.601
- What does that mean?
You don't do anything?
- Um, not really.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.036
I'm just enjoying the ride.

24:30.069 --> 24:34.674
So you don't have any
interests or hobbies...?

24:34.707 --> 24:38.645
What's the point?
Everything's temporary, right?

24:38.678 --> 24:42.515
Everything ends.
Like your career.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.486
So, what are you
gonna be now?

24:49.556 --> 24:51.758
All I want to be
is invisible.

24:52.992 --> 24:53.993
Yeah.

24:56.062 --> 25:00.299
Tomorrow afternoon, a few
of us are gonna hang out.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.934
Why don't you come?

25:01.968 --> 25:04.571
And if you want,
we'll pretend like
you're not even there.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.673
Thanks, but I have this
open house thing at the gym.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.542
I thought
your career was over.

25:09.576 --> 25:12.511
I still have friends there.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.683
Friends that get you?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.325
Hey. Can I help
you find something?

25:26.358 --> 25:31.764
How about everything?
You've rearranged
the whole office.

25:31.798 --> 25:35.067
And why can't I log
onto our website?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.969
I'm sorry.
I changed the password.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.838
You changed the password?

25:38.871 --> 25:42.008
- I should have
asked you first.
- Why should you have asked me?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.712
You didn't ask me
about the filing system
or color coding everything

25:45.745 --> 25:48.615
or anything else
you've "Summerized."

25:48.648 --> 25:51.651
- Kim, I'm sorry.
- Forget it. Just...

25:54.353 --> 25:58.891
Summer, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. It's not you.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.894
I just feel like I've
lost control of everything.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.133
My daughter, my job, my life.

26:07.166 --> 26:10.136
- I'm so sorry.
- It's been a hard week.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.673
And I know it's nothing
like what Payson lost.

26:13.706 --> 26:17.376
- It's not nothing.
- I haven't had a job

26:17.409 --> 26:20.012
since before
the girls were born.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.016
And, you know,
I kind of liked it.

26:24.050 --> 26:28.154
- And I was good at it.
- I'm reminded of how good
you were at it every day.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.958
I know I can go
a little overboard
with the color coding.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.894
It's just sort of my way
of staying in control.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.163
But you did it effortlessly,

26:37.196 --> 26:40.166
and you juggled
a husband and kids.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.168
Thanks, Summer.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.920
Ugh! Jeez! You're not
the only one on the mat!

27:00.953 --> 27:03.756
Or in the universe,
for that matter!
Not like you would know it!

27:03.790 --> 27:06.192
- What exactly
is your problem with me?
- My problem?

27:06.225 --> 27:09.195
You're the one who
keeps treating me like
their bratty little sister

27:09.228 --> 27:11.163
you can't
stand to be around.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.132
- You are a little bratty.
- And you're a bully.

27:13.165 --> 27:16.703
Look, I know that you
wish that I was Payson,

27:16.736 --> 27:19.672
and I'm not good enough
to be the National Champion.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.942
And you're the only one
who had any competition
and blah, blah, blah.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.844
Well, I'm sick of it.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.815
I don't have to apologize
to you or to anyone else.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.183
I beat all the best gymnasts
in the country,

27:31.217 --> 27:35.121
and what makes everyone
else think that I wouldn't
have beaten Payson, too?

27:39.892 --> 27:41.093
You're right.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.962
Maybe you would
have beaten Payson.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.698
You've got the skill.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.133
What?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.235
Oh.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.104
Now you're being nice to me
because you finally made me cry.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.107
I wasn't trying
to make you cry.
I'm sorry.

27:55.141 --> 27:58.244
OK? It's just that you came out
of nowhere and nabbed the gold.

27:58.277 --> 28:02.982
I train harder than
any guy out there,
and I still came in second.

28:03.015 --> 28:07.954
I've been in the gym
six days a week
since I was five years old.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.790
I hardly came out of nowhere.

28:10.823 --> 28:15.127
And, you know, winning the
silver medal at Nationals

28:15.161 --> 28:17.263
is nothing to be ashamed of.

28:17.296 --> 28:22.134
Nicky, you're
an amazing gymnast

28:22.168 --> 28:24.937
and you'll win it next year.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.107
Thanks.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.477
And look,

28:31.510 --> 28:33.212
I don't wish you were Payson.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.247
OK?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.784
Truce?

28:39.118 --> 28:41.053
Truce.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.193
Well, we really
better pull it together,

28:47.226 --> 28:49.161
or we're gonna
look like idiots tomorrow.

28:49.195 --> 28:52.231
Actually, I have an idea,
if you're open to it.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.767
Keep talking.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.235
Have you ever
been to a bullfight?

29:09.816 --> 29:13.219
Sweetie, this isn't like you.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.321
Why are you obsessing
over all this stuff

29:15.354 --> 29:17.289
when you have a big
routine to get ready for?

29:17.323 --> 29:20.326
- No offense, Mom,
but you wouldn't understand.
- Why not?

29:20.359 --> 29:24.897
Because you don't care
what people think of you.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.801
All right, tell me
what's wrong, really.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.237
Well, there's
an entire thread called

29:31.270 --> 29:34.240
"Emily Kmetko,
Charity Case or Real Deal?"

29:34.273 --> 29:38.077
And someone just called me
"the backstreet hoax."

29:40.279 --> 29:42.148
Why is everyone judging me?

29:42.181 --> 29:46.218
Isn't the issue here
that you're judging you?

29:49.989 --> 29:52.959
Don't you ever just wish
that we were a normal family?

29:52.992 --> 29:56.829
- With a normal past?
- [laughs] What fun
would that be, honey?

29:56.863 --> 30:00.132
Well, I wouldn't have
to defend myself and my
story to everyone every day.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.935
OK, I have an idea.

30:02.969 --> 30:07.273
Everyone else seems be debating
the Emily Kmetko story.

30:07.306 --> 30:12.278
And you're reading about it,
like you're an observer
in your own life.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.613
Maybe you should tell it.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.249
- Tell it tomorrow.
- I can't do that.

30:17.283 --> 30:23.155
Why not? Just tell the
story yourself and own it.

30:23.189 --> 30:26.225
That way, no one
can use it against you.

30:26.258 --> 30:29.195
This isn't a campfire.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.163
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.366
I do.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.077
- Page one.
- Oh, no!

30:45.111 --> 30:47.246
- Not...
- Look at you.

30:47.279 --> 30:51.383
That was your first handstand.
I knew I was in trouble then.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.987
Come on.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.230
[* Jordan McCoy: Rockstar]

Are you guys ready
to see some really fun stuff?

31:13.205 --> 31:16.108
[applause, cheering]

31:18.077 --> 31:21.914
Good, because gymnastics
isn't just about hard work
and discipline,

31:21.948 --> 31:25.351
it's about having fun
and doing amazing things.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.320
You can defy gravity
like superheroes.

31:28.354 --> 31:33.292
And today, our super gymnasts
are gonna share their
superpowers with you.

31:33.325 --> 31:37.229
First up, we have the
Queen of the Beam,
Lauren Tanner!

31:37.263 --> 31:39.365

* Put on your combat boots

* What? Pump the fist

31:54.513 --> 31:56.983

Up next, National Team Member,
Emily Kmetko.

32:51.570 --> 32:55.174
[applause, cheering]

32:57.576 --> 32:59.378
Do any of you guys
know how to jump rope?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.747
[kids shouting
enthusiastically]

33:01.780 --> 33:04.150
Could you guys come
up here and help me?

33:14.193 --> 33:19.098
When I was a kid,
I used to play in the alley
behind our apartment complex.

33:20.532 --> 33:25.071
My mom worked a lot, so to keep
myself entertained, I'd do this.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.340
Making up routines,
doing tricks.

33:28.374 --> 33:32.211
I never thought
it was anything.
I was just playing.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.349
[cheering]

33:42.488 --> 33:46.192
I thought what was
important was that
I was learning the tricks,

33:46.225 --> 33:48.594
but what I was learning
was rhythm.

33:48.627 --> 33:53.099
A gymnast needs rhythm.
I didn't have
a traditional background.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.566
For instance...

33:59.205 --> 34:02.141
...I didn't learn how to do
a giant on the uneven bars.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.543
I learned it on a jungle gym.

34:04.576 --> 34:08.447
I scored a 15.8
on the bars at Nationals.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.482
So I must've learned something.

34:19.591 --> 34:23.495
And I didn't learn
how to do this on a beam.

34:23.529 --> 34:27.533
I learned how to do it on the
ledge behind my apartment.

34:27.566 --> 34:32.371
But last time I checked,
I was one of ten people
in the world

34:32.404 --> 34:34.072
who could do this.

34:36.642 --> 34:40.179
[cheering]

34:40.212 --> 34:45.884
As an elite gymnast, some
days are easier than others.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.453
But if you have
that beat in your head,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.888
if you know where you come from

34:49.921 --> 34:54.160
and what it feels like
when you play, full out...

34:56.695 --> 35:00.666
- ...then you can do anything.
- [cheering]

35:08.707 --> 35:10.676
And now,
for your viewing pleasure,

35:10.709 --> 35:14.513
we have a double routine
featuring the women's
national champion

35:14.546 --> 35:17.549
and the men's silver medalist,

35:17.583 --> 35:21.453
- Kaylie and Nicky.
- [cheering, applause]

35:21.487 --> 35:24.690
[Spanish music plays]

35:46.412 --> 35:47.746
[laughing]

35:52.651 --> 35:54.720
- [applause]
- I have to go.

35:54.753 --> 35:58.457
- Where?
- I'm gonna meet some kids
from school. Is that OK?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.627
Yeah, it's OK. It's great.
Do you want a ride?

36:01.660 --> 36:06.398
No, it's close.
And the physical therapist
says I need to walk more.

36:06.432 --> 36:10.202
Well, OK.
Keep your cell phone on.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.404
And have fun!

36:16.508 --> 36:19.645
- [applause]
- Payson.

36:21.413 --> 36:24.450
- You OK?
- [crowd gasping]

36:24.483 --> 36:28.387
- [applause]
- You'll find another dream.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.757
I'm done dreaming.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.279
[applause]

37:11.730 --> 37:14.566
[applause, cheering]

37:15.834 --> 37:17.569
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

37:26.312 --> 37:28.414
[cheering]

37:50.636 --> 37:53.739
- [man] You were
great out there.
- [Emily] Thank you so much.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.707
Excuse me.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.510
I just wanted to tell you
that until I heard your story,

37:58.544 --> 38:00.579
I thought I could never
make it at the elite level

38:00.612 --> 38:03.315
because my family
can't afford to send me
to a club like this.

38:03.349 --> 38:07.619
But now I know that if I work
hard and believe in myself,
there's nothing I can't do.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.891
Anyway, I just wanted
to say thank you
for sharing your story.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.363
Do you think I could
have your autograph?

38:19.130 --> 38:22.434
- Where did you get this?
- Off your fan site.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.537
- I have a fan site?
- Yeah. Just Google yourself.

38:28.774 --> 38:34.546
Guess what? This is the first
time anyone's ever come up to me
and asked me for my autograph.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.489
Thank you.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.594
How do you feel
about your story now?

38:51.497 --> 38:53.399
[Emily] I think it's amazing.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.368
I think we're amazing.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.839
[Sasha] Can The Rock
members gather, please?

39:06.912 --> 39:10.916
I would like
to congratulate you all
on a really fun exhibition.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.485
[applause]

39:13.519 --> 39:16.788
So who won?
As if we already don't know.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.391
Hot tamale! Kaylie and Nicky!

39:19.425 --> 39:21.660
Kalicky, Kalicky, Kalicky.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.929
Actually, I don't
know who won.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.132
- Wait. But what about
the applause-o-meter?
- This thing?

39:27.165 --> 39:31.503
This doesn't work. It's ancient.
You're not the only ones
who get to have fun around here.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.539
And just to keep
the good times rolling,

39:33.572 --> 39:36.708
- I'm gonna call a special
Sunday practice tomorrow.
- Why?

39:36.742 --> 39:40.546
You wasted most of the week
practicing those routines.
It's time to get back to work.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.449
I will see you all,
bright and early
tomorrow, 8:00am.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.821
- What?
- That's your idea of fun?

39:49.855 --> 39:52.991
Yeah. So, what's
your idea of fun?

39:57.228 --> 40:00.432
Sorry about Lauren.
I'll kill her later.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.534
Nah. It's cool.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.438
I wonder where Payson is.

40:06.472 --> 40:09.441
Yeah, I thought she was coming.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.977
She did. But she left
before your routine.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.613
- Oh. She did?
- Yeah, Mrs. Keeler said

40:14.646 --> 40:18.584
she went to hang out
with her high school friends.
I wonder if she's met a boy.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.852
[soft rock plays]

40:20.886 --> 40:23.722
Lauren doesn't know
what she's talking about.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.891
No. I know.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.030
* On my own

40:34.600 --> 40:36.835
* Can't wait to be

40:36.868 --> 40:38.704
- Hey! You came!
- Yeah.

40:38.737 --> 40:42.207
[Ike laughs]
Hey, everyone, this is Payson.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.610
She's the newest
inmate at Taft High.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.479
And no, she doesn't
have a stick up her ass.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.915
She broke her back,
so she has to wear a brace.

40:49.948 --> 40:53.251
Oh, and, um, she wants
to be invisible. So...

40:53.284 --> 40:54.486
- [boy] Cool.
- Yeah.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.787
[girl] You want a beer?

40:55.821 --> 40:58.657
- Uh, no thanks.
- [boy] How 'bout some weed?

41:00.992 --> 41:03.595
You asked how
I stay unattached?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.797
This helps.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.668
Maybe later.
I'm cool for now.

41:09.701 --> 41:10.902
OK.

41:10.936 --> 41:15.607
* I'm just the peace of white

41:23.081 --> 41:27.018
* Can't wait
to be yours tonight *

41:27.052 --> 41:30.088
- What are you doing?
- I was worried about you.
What time is it?

41:32.824 --> 41:37.763
- Are you drunk?
- [laughs] What do you care?

41:37.796 --> 41:40.532
When are you gonna get
that I'm the only one
who does care?

41:40.566 --> 41:43.268
Here, you need to drink water.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.936
You're not my mother.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.809
Is that you with her?

41:51.977 --> 41:54.546
That was taken a week
before she died.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.684
You must really miss her.

41:58.717 --> 42:03.555
She believed in me.
In my gymnastics.

42:03.589 --> 42:07.759
- Not like my dad.
- I believe in you, too.

42:07.793 --> 42:12.831
You could be a great gymnast
if you focused on training
instead of Kaylie.

42:12.864 --> 42:17.569
- As good as Nicky?
- Better.

42:17.603 --> 42:19.971
You can have
everything you want, Carter.

42:20.005 --> 42:22.708
Everything you need.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.075
It's all right
in front of you.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.745
You just have to take it.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.016
You're right.

42:33.952 --> 42:37.088
But why wouldn't Kaylie
be impressed by Nicky?

42:37.122 --> 42:39.591
He's a winner.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.092
And I've been acting
like a big loser.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.864
I can be as good as Nicky.
Better.

42:45.897 --> 42:46.965
I just need to work harder.

42:46.998 --> 42:50.902
Well, it sounds like you're
getting your act together.

42:50.936 --> 42:53.605
I'm gonna start
by getting my own place.

42:54.973 --> 42:57.776
- How are you gonna
pay the rent?
- I got a job.

42:57.809 --> 43:01.012
- Where?
- The Pizza Shack.

43:01.046 --> 43:04.115
How are you gonna train harder
and work at the Pizza Shack?

43:04.149 --> 43:07.118
It's called the night shift.
If Emily can do it, so can I.

43:07.152 --> 43:10.088
You're gonna work nights
with Emily?

43:10.121 --> 43:12.958
Yeah.

43:12.991 --> 43:16.194
I got to sleep this off
so I get in the gym tomorrow.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.132
Lauren?

43:22.133 --> 43:23.201
Yes?

43:25.671 --> 43:26.672
Thanks.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.675
For letting me stay here, and...

43:30.942 --> 43:32.110
...for believing in me.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.015
You're welcome.

43:37.048 --> 43:38.850
[soft rock plays]

43:38.884 --> 43:41.653
* 'Cause I just hate
to see you suffer *

43:42.921 --> 43:46.925
* Jump back, don't let
it catch you sleeping *

43:46.958 --> 43:50.395
* One crack, that's all
you're really needing *

43:50.428 --> 43:55.701
* Leap back, you know
I hate to see you suffer *

44:11.717 --> 44:16.154
* So stay with me tonight

44:16.187 --> 44:20.892
* I'm on your side

44:20.926 --> 44:25.997
* You'll be all right *
