WEBVTT

00:20.625 --> 00:22.333
Okay, voice in my head,

00:22.416 --> 00:24.416
I clearly found your champion.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.791
Now what?

00:30.541 --> 00:32.000
-Ahh!

00:32.083 --> 00:33.041
-Oh!

00:39.333 --> 00:40.458
-Capture.
-Ah!

00:40.541 --> 00:42.041
-Remain still. Contain.
-Okay, okay.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.541
That Tribe brat

00:43.625 --> 00:46.375
managed to harness
the Sword's power for himself...

00:47.625 --> 00:48.875
Whoa.

00:48.958 --> 00:49.875
-Halt.
-Ah!

00:49.958 --> 00:52.041
-Remain still.
-Uh!

00:52.125 --> 00:53.958
Do not run.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.708
Where--ow!

01:07.625 --> 01:08.750
Eh, I'll take it.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.250
-Ha-ha!
-Stand down.

01:13.791 --> 01:14.791
Ah!

01:16.000 --> 01:16.916
Glitch.

01:18.416 --> 01:20.166
Ahh!

01:21.458 --> 01:23.375
-Danger!

01:23.458 --> 01:24.375
Ha-ha!

01:24.458 --> 01:25.875
-Incinerate.
-Huh?

01:28.333 --> 01:29.541
No magic.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.458
Okay, fine.

01:31.541 --> 01:34.333
Let's see how this works instead.

01:35.666 --> 01:36.583
Yah!

01:37.750 --> 01:38.666
Ow.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.916
-Are you...
-Glitch.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.291
-Hurt?
-No.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.666
I'm just trying to do that cool thing,

01:44.750 --> 01:46.708
you know, where you flip up
onto your feet.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.791
Oh, come on.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.708
I'll get the sword
from that muscle-bound child.

01:51.791 --> 01:54.416
You deal with his friends
back in the woods.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.125
With pleasure.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.541
There you go.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.000
Don't make it weird.

02:08.458 --> 02:09.708
You can do that?

02:09.791 --> 02:11.541
I guess I can.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.500
Wonder what else I can do.

02:16.958 --> 02:19.458
Ad dampnum effingo!

02:23.958 --> 02:25.208
Capture. Contain.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.000
Do not run.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.666
-Impact.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.875
Ah! Oh, oh!

02:33.958 --> 02:36.583
Stop punching things!

02:36.666 --> 02:38.041
She cast a duplication spell.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.916
You can't hit them without making more.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.291
Stay behind me.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.416
Incoming!

02:56.500 --> 02:58.416
Ah!

02:59.208 --> 03:00.708
What are you doing?

03:00.791 --> 03:04.458
I have no idea!

03:07.083 --> 03:08.833
Lightning strike!

03:27.375 --> 03:28.916
Ahh...

03:34.833 --> 03:37.583
I have the Power!

04:21.041 --> 04:22.333
Adam!

04:22.416 --> 04:23.750
We gotta help him.

04:23.833 --> 04:26.541
You might wanna worry
about helping yourself first.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.416
You burned down our village.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.125
Oh, was that your village?

04:32.208 --> 04:34.041
You'll do no more harm this night,

04:34.125 --> 04:35.375
you technological terror.

04:45.041 --> 04:49.583
There's nothing more useless
than a kitty without its claws.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.458
This is for the Tiger Tribe!

05:04.291 --> 05:06.625
Don't worry. I'll make this quick.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.750
Huh?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.291
Aw, crud.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.416
Adam! Wake up!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.833
"Adam"?

05:19.916 --> 05:21.791
Very interesting.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.125
Circa!

05:28.166 --> 05:30.958
I'm sure she'll be... fine?

05:33.208 --> 05:35.333
We've got you.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.708
Wait for me!

05:43.416 --> 05:45.166
-Everyone ready?

05:46.666 --> 05:49.000
-Let me in!

05:49.083 --> 05:51.291
-I'm letting her in.
-Don't you dare.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.375
That witch has caused enough trouble.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.791
Please!

05:56.750 --> 05:59.083
-Uh, guys?

05:59.166 --> 06:01.791
-We gotta go.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.958
Fine.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.250
Whatever.

06:08.416 --> 06:10.083
Hey, there, Teela.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.958
You're Kronis's--
"Dinkin" was your name, right?

06:13.041 --> 06:15.291
I'm Duncan's "Duncan"...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.583
...but, yeah, that's me.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.041
Hey.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.541
Remember that time I saved you guys

06:25.625 --> 06:26.541
and drove through all those trees

06:26.625 --> 06:28.708
and ran over my boss
and the witch he hangs out with?

06:28.791 --> 06:30.125
You're welcome.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.416
I kind of broke our getaway vehicle
in the process.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.208
Then just drop us back at the village
and keep going.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.625
You can't go back, not as long as they
want that sword and we have it.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.958
So throw it out the window
and let me take my friends home!

06:40.041 --> 06:41.458
Is that what Adam would want?

06:41.541 --> 06:43.125
Don't say his name like you know him.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.000
What I know is that
the cuff he had on his arm

06:46.083 --> 06:48.458
merged with the sword like
they were meant to be together.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.000
Why would they do that?

06:50.083 --> 06:52.916
I think Adam's just as connected
to Grayskull as I am,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.625
and I think he'd want to know why.

06:54.708 --> 06:55.666
Don't you?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.125
He would do no less for us.

07:00.208 --> 07:03.375
-But the village--
-Is strong and shall endure.

07:05.416 --> 07:06.708
I need to set us down somewhere

07:06.791 --> 07:08.000
and get to work on those engines.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.875
Find a good hiding spot,
and make it quick.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.208
We won't have
knocked Evelyn down for long.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.708
F-foliage.

07:20.791 --> 07:23.291
Ahh!

07:24.750 --> 07:26.375
Oh... ow.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.541
All right.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.041
Don't just float there. Find them.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.000
Your runt hit me with a transport.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.041
When we find him, how's about
we both hit him with one?

07:49.125 --> 07:51.583
I'd like that.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.625
Soon, Randor.

08:07.708 --> 08:10.958
I have unfinished business
to attend to first.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.416
King Randor?

08:15.500 --> 08:18.125
What did the thief take?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.583
A sword, Your Grace.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.958
The Sword.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.125
My only son,

08:26.208 --> 08:28.958
my only son and my brother,

08:29.041 --> 08:32.500
died because of the power
that sword can harness.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.791
Find the thief, General.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.791
I want to look her in the eyes

08:37.875 --> 08:41.125
when I take that sword
back from her grasp.

08:41.833 --> 08:42.750
We're doomed.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.291
By the Power of Grayskull?

08:44.375 --> 08:45.291
What did he say?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.333
Let me try, let me try, let me try.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.958
I have the power!

08:58.833 --> 09:00.916
I thought you said
those were the words, Witchy.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.708
Where's all the...

09:02.791 --> 09:03.708
...you promised?

09:03.791 --> 09:04.708
No, no, no, no.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.250
You're putting emphasis on the wrong word.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.875
Watch. Try it like...

09:08.958 --> 09:13.041
I... have the power!

09:14.041 --> 09:15.416
I feel different.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.083
-Do I look different?

09:17.166 --> 09:19.625
Uh, perhaps it's more
along the lines of...

09:19.708 --> 09:21.625
I haff the pow-rah!

09:21.708 --> 09:24.500
This isn't a toy.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.333
The sword's out of juice, anyway.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.000
Adam!

09:28.083 --> 09:30.791
-You okay?
-So what did it feel like?

09:30.875 --> 09:33.166
You turned into a big, ol' He-Man.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.875
Were you still you on the inside,

09:34.958 --> 09:36.416
but you looked like him on the outside?

09:36.500 --> 09:38.208
Or was he the same on the outside

09:38.291 --> 09:39.333
as he was on the inside

09:39.416 --> 09:40.875
and you were somewhere else entirely?

09:40.958 --> 09:43.750
That's a lot of questions. Wait.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.541
-Who are you?
-Duncan.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.166
Formerly of the bad guys.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.833
The same bad guys that torched my village?

09:49.916 --> 09:51.416
Uh--uh...

09:52.291 --> 09:53.833
Mm. You know what?

09:53.916 --> 09:55.625
I'm gonna go get to work on that engine.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.916
Glad you have you back.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.416
Here. This is apparently yours.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.875
"Champion."

10:07.500 --> 10:10.291
I think I'm just gonna get
a little air for a minute.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.041
Stressed?

10:21.125 --> 10:22.791
We lost the Sword of Grayskull

10:22.875 --> 10:25.833
to a bunch of children
who then stole our vehicle.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.833
No. Why would I be stressed?

10:28.916 --> 10:31.125
Any good news from the poacher's drones?

10:31.208 --> 10:32.916
They're still searching.

10:34.291 --> 10:35.208
Think I found us a way

10:35.291 --> 10:37.791
to maybe make up some lost time
while we wait.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.541
Couple of sky sleds parked
near Randor's checkpoint.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.333
Did the dullard finally realize

10:44.416 --> 10:47.625
what had actually been stolen
from under his nose?

10:47.708 --> 10:48.958
See for yourself.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.041
No, thanks.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.708
I've got my own.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.500
Magnificantes vitrum.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.291
Show-off.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.833
Why aren't any of them moving?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.000
Something isn't right.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.500
Et lux.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.791
Curiouser and curiouser.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.041
What happened to them?

11:31.125 --> 11:32.791
Someone or something

11:32.875 --> 11:35.666
drained them of their very life's essence.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.541
That's very dark magic,

11:37.625 --> 11:39.250
even by my standards.

11:43.416 --> 11:44.541
Cool.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.958
Run! Save yourselves!

11:51.333 --> 11:52.958
Save ourselves from who?

11:53.041 --> 11:56.833
"From whom."

12:07.958 --> 12:09.875
It can't be.

12:09.958 --> 12:10.958
Can it?

12:13.416 --> 12:18.458
Oh, it can, dear friends.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.291
-That voice.
-Prince Keldor?

12:21.375 --> 12:22.750
In the flesh...

12:25.666 --> 12:27.458
...or what's left of it.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.916
Join me, won't you?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
There's much to discuss.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.083
You wanna talk?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.041
Gosh, Krass, about what?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.333
Oh, I don't know.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.583
Ram-Ball. The weather.

13:01.666 --> 13:04.125
Oh, and maybe He-Man?

13:04.208 --> 13:06.375
The "He" was still me on the inside.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.333
That sword back there...

13:08.416 --> 13:11.541
it connected me to something
bigger than myself,

13:11.625 --> 13:14.750
bigger than the tribe or the jungle, even.

13:14.833 --> 13:18.541
Something... old and important.

13:19.958 --> 13:23.125
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

13:23.208 --> 13:24.333
I don't know.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.083
Oh, ah--

13:28.166 --> 13:30.958
-Ah!

13:31.041 --> 13:34.125
Well, the witch back there
thinks that sword back there

13:34.208 --> 13:36.125
has something to do
with wherever you came from...

13:36.208 --> 13:38.541
back then, before Cringer found you.

13:38.625 --> 13:42.125
Which is kind of the exact thing
I've been waiting for,

13:42.208 --> 13:45.500
some sign that there was more to my life
before the jungle.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.250
Then why are you up here moping

13:47.333 --> 13:49.791
instead of down there asking questions?

13:49.875 --> 13:53.125
Because I'm afraid
I'll lose you and Cringer

13:53.208 --> 13:54.666
once I start learning the answers.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.250
Do I like being away from the jungle?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.250
No.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.583
Do I like the witch that's
turned our lives upside down?

14:01.666 --> 14:02.583
No.

14:02.666 --> 14:04.875
Was that something I should have eaten?

14:04.958 --> 14:06.583
-No.
-Krass.

14:06.666 --> 14:09.041
Do I like the thought of you leaving?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.708
No.

14:10.791 --> 14:13.666
That's why I'm coming with you,
to help you see this through.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.416
Tiger Tribe roar?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
Tiger Tribe roar.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.125
Okay, okay.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.916
The metals in these rocks should shield us

14:29.000 --> 14:30.041
from the drones for a little while...

14:31.083 --> 14:33.041
...but your cubs making all that noise

14:33.125 --> 14:36.125
won't help us with the low profile
we need to keep.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.000
What are they doing?

14:43.541 --> 14:45.541
Being a family.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.875
-Are you...
-Cold?

14:52.958 --> 14:57.125
I'll admit there's a chill in my bones
I just can't shake.

14:58.916 --> 15:01.166
A chill in my bones.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.000
Would you like to know what isn't funny?

15:07.083 --> 15:09.833
Convalescing in stasis for ten years

15:09.916 --> 15:12.333
while I waited for a rescue
that never came.

15:12.416 --> 15:15.166
You kidnapped the king's son
the night of our coup,

15:15.250 --> 15:16.500
then vanished.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.708
All of Eternos thought you dead.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.708
There was a funeral and everything.

15:20.791 --> 15:21.750
Oh.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.541
Was it fancy?

15:23.625 --> 15:25.375
Well, we were in exile
because of the coup,

15:25.458 --> 15:26.375
so we didn't really--

15:26.458 --> 15:29.208
What's important is that
we are back together now.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.458
How did you find us?

15:30.541 --> 15:33.708
This serendipitous circumstance
is just that.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.125
I came across Randor's lackeys

15:36.208 --> 15:38.041
on my way back to Castle Grayskull

15:38.125 --> 15:40.208
to finish what I started.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.000
You know where it is?

15:43.083 --> 15:46.416
How else do you think
I became the man I am today?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.541
The castle and its infernal guardian

15:49.625 --> 15:51.750
afflicted me with this blight of havoc

15:51.833 --> 15:55.041
when I tried to seize
Grayskull's power for myself...

15:58.125 --> 16:01.375
...choosing this scepter
instead of the sword.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.375
Well, the scepter seems very nice.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.583
Yes, well, this "very nice"
scepter can't fix me.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.916
The castle can,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.125
but not without the sword.

16:18.208 --> 16:22.125
We had hoped to use the sword
to exact our revenge on Randor,

16:22.208 --> 16:25.291
If we can harness the power
of Grayskull itself...

16:25.375 --> 16:29.208
The sword is the key to everything.

16:32.708 --> 16:35.291
And we know exactly
where they're hiding with it.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.000
Where who is hiding with it?

16:39.083 --> 16:40.333
You may not have been

16:40.416 --> 16:43.541
the only royal to cheat death that night.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.041
Is that what the voice
in your head looks like?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.416
I think it's where
the voice in my head lives.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.166
I've seen it in my dreams
for as long as I can remember.

17:10.916 --> 17:12.375
I think it's Castle Grayskull.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.708
So if we find the castle,

17:16.791 --> 17:19.916
we can learn more about, well, everything.

17:23.708 --> 17:24.625
-And then...

17:24.708 --> 17:25.833
...we can fix the sword

17:25.916 --> 17:28.041
and get that big ol' He-Man
back out, right?

17:28.125 --> 17:29.541
I'm still me on the inside.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.208
Well, "Me-Man" just sounds ridiculous.

17:32.291 --> 17:33.333
Stop!

17:33.416 --> 17:34.500
-Ow!

17:34.583 --> 17:36.541
No fair with the helmet!

17:36.625 --> 17:38.000
-Adam the Amazing!
-He-Man.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.250
-Man-Adam.
-He-Man.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.458
Bigger Adam.

17:40.541 --> 17:41.916
I think that's the one.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.416
-Really?
-He-Man.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
Ugh. Teela.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.416
Honestly, I don't care.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.000
Ow!

17:50.083 --> 17:51.833
Ah! Stop!

17:51.916 --> 17:53.375
What about you, Dinky?

17:53.458 --> 17:54.541
What should we call him?

17:54.625 --> 17:56.041
Whatever we end up calling him,

17:56.125 --> 17:57.750
I think we need him back, fast.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.083
They couldn't have found us
that quickly, could they?

18:15.208 --> 18:16.916
Capture. Contain.

18:17.000 --> 18:17.916
Contain.

18:20.416 --> 18:21.708
Get back to the ship!

18:30.166 --> 18:31.958
Any time now, Duncan!

18:32.041 --> 18:33.500
Working on it!

18:42.500 --> 18:43.708
Oh, right.

18:43.791 --> 18:44.958
Ah...

18:48.041 --> 18:49.458
Ahh!

18:49.541 --> 18:50.958
Cringer, stay back!

18:51.041 --> 18:53.041
My family is in danger, Adam.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.458
I'm here to help.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.583
Uh, Cringer...

18:55.666 --> 18:56.708
Yeah?

18:56.791 --> 18:59.583
Talky the Tiger can actually
be super useful to me inside.

18:59.666 --> 19:00.791
I need someone to flip the switch

19:00.875 --> 19:02.083
when I give the signal... whoa!

19:02.166 --> 19:03.500
...so we can get the heck out of here.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.125
Then flip it, I shall,

19:05.208 --> 19:06.458
with aplomb, no less.

19:06.541 --> 19:07.625
Thanks, Duncan.

19:07.708 --> 19:09.500
A good engineer
uses all the tools in his belt.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.208
Hah!

19:13.291 --> 19:14.708
Can you use them a little faster, maybe?

19:14.791 --> 19:16.541
Working on it!

19:27.208 --> 19:29.166
Talky, now!

19:43.916 --> 19:45.416
Gonna need a few more minutes, gang.

20:05.583 --> 20:06.750
-Glitch.
-Ha-ha!

20:10.041 --> 20:11.000
Oh.

20:13.916 --> 20:14.833
Huh?

20:21.916 --> 20:23.250
They're still enchanted.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.583
So un-enchant them.

20:24.666 --> 20:27.458
My magic isn't strong enough
to undo someone else's spell.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.875
Huh, well, it was nice meeting all of you.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.625
-Ah!

20:43.708 --> 20:44.958
No!

20:45.041 --> 20:46.416
There's too many of them!

21:00.208 --> 21:01.333
Who's there?

21:02.041 --> 21:04.166
Why, Adam...

21:04.250 --> 21:07.833
don't you recognize your Uncle Keldor?

21:25.166 --> 21:27.375
It's time to come home.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.333
Home?
