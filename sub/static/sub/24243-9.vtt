00:10.560 --> 00:13.411
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh! Jesus!

00:13.412 --> 00:15.813
I didn't even know you were here!

00:15.814 --> 00:18.650
And why are you here?
You're supposed to be

00:18.651 --> 00:21.019
- at Grandma and Grandpa's.
- Yeah, I didn't feel good

00:21.020 --> 00:23.321
on the way to school,
so Dad dropped me off and said

00:23.322 --> 00:25.657
- that I could stay home today.
- What's the matter?

00:25.658 --> 00:29.027
- I have a stomach ache.
- Well...

00:29.028 --> 00:31.162
Well, you don't look
or feel sick, kiddo.

00:31.163 --> 00:34.332
- I am, Mom.
- OK.

00:34.333 --> 00:38.102
Are you sure you're OK
to stay home alone all day?

00:38.103 --> 00:40.171
I'll be fine, I'll have my phone.

00:40.172 --> 00:44.142
Well... Go get into bed
before I change my mind.

00:46.011 --> 00:48.279
Are you and Dad getting a divorce?

00:48.280 --> 00:51.516
Is that why we've been staying
with Grandma and Grandpa

00:51.517 --> 00:53.885
- without you?
- What?

00:53.886 --> 00:55.887
No!

00:55.888 --> 00:59.057
No, it's...
because they miss you so much

00:59.058 --> 01:01.225
and because of my crazy work schedule

01:01.226 --> 01:03.528
- these past few days.
- Emma's mom took her

01:03.529 --> 01:06.531
to stay with her Grandparents
for a week last year and...

01:06.532 --> 01:09.901
now, her dad lives in a condo
in Liberty Village.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.870
Hey, come here.

01:12.871 --> 01:15.206
You are far too perceptive
for your own good,

01:15.207 --> 01:18.309
you know that?

01:18.310 --> 01:20.311
It's one of the millions of reasons

01:20.312 --> 01:23.581
why I love you so much. You're right.

01:23.582 --> 01:25.883
Me and Dad have been a bit off,
but... divorce?

01:25.884 --> 01:30.054
Nah-ah. No. We are team Hall.

01:30.055 --> 01:32.890
We operate as a unit of four. Yeah?

01:32.891 --> 01:36.394
- Yeah.
- Yeah. OK.

01:36.395 --> 01:39.197
Go on. Go get into bed.

Oh... Stop!

01:58.851 --> 02:01.686
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:11.797 --> 02:14.932
Ow...

02:14.933 --> 02:17.135
Oh!

02:17.136 --> 02:20.605
Good morning!

02:20.606 --> 02:23.441
Is it?

02:23.442 --> 02:26.110
You're right.

02:26.111 --> 02:29.447
Good morning, sir! It's a great day.

02:29.448 --> 02:32.183
Wonderful day. It's a gift!

02:32.184 --> 02:35.520
It's a fricking blessing!

02:38.157 --> 02:40.391
Nope.

02:42.961 --> 02:46.330
Hey... Sir... Huh...

02:46.331 --> 02:49.167
Which says "I'm a
grown-up" more to you?

02:49.168 --> 02:51.135
This one or...

02:51.136 --> 02:53.738
- this one?
- What?

02:58.110 --> 03:00.812
Perfect.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.848
My life...

03:17.029 --> 03:19.197
Staff Inspector, hi.
Nice to see you again.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.165
Huh, victim's name is Jason Dune.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.201
- 50, Caucasian. Three gunshots...
- Where's the body?

03:23.202 --> 03:25.462
- Huh, in the basement.
- Thank you, Phillips!

03:25.463 --> 03:27.128
Huh, it's... Phelps.

03:53.298 --> 03:56.234
Where's the gun?

03:56.235 --> 03:59.036
We bagged it and sent it off to
the firearms unit for examination.

03:59.037 --> 04:01.239
- The wife?
- She's upstairs with Sullivan.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.642
She's still pretty wasted.

04:04.643 --> 04:06.744
Forensics just pulled in.
Should we send them in?

04:06.745 --> 04:09.647
Tell them to wait. I want
my guys to see it clean first.

04:09.648 --> 04:11.716
Copy that. 3-18.
Boss says hold them up.

04:11.717 --> 04:14.652
- We're waiting on her detectives.
- Any kids in the house?

04:14.653 --> 04:16.553
- No, boss, no kids.
- Teri-Lynn Dune,

04:16.555 --> 04:19.390
I'm Detective Fiona Currie. I'm gonna
be in charge of this investigation.

04:19.391 --> 04:22.393
- How did you get that black eye?
- I don't know.

04:22.394 --> 04:25.663
- Was it from your husband?
- I don't remember.

04:25.664 --> 04:28.733
You want to tell me
what happened last night?

04:28.734 --> 04:31.068
I woke up.

04:31.069 --> 04:33.337
There was so much blood...

04:33.338 --> 04:35.907
But I don't remember what happened!

04:35.908 --> 04:39.243
I want you to listen
to something, Teri-Lynn.

04:39.244 --> 04:42.280
- 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
- He's shot!

04:42.281 --> 04:44.749
He's not breathing!

04:44.750 --> 04:48.085
Oh, my God!
There's blood... everywhere!

04:48.086 --> 04:50.755
- OK. Ma'am, ma'am, who's shot?
- My husband.

04:50.756 --> 04:53.758
I think he's... dead!

04:53.759 --> 04:56.761
- Ma'am, who shot your husband?
- I have the gun!

04:56.762 --> 05:00.064
I shot him! Oh, my God!

05:00.065 --> 05:02.366
Who's voice is that, Teri-Lynn?

05:04.603 --> 05:07.305
Mine.

05:07.306 --> 05:11.108
It's my...

05:23.121 --> 05:25.323
Cooper!

05:25.324 --> 05:27.458
Pfff! Woman who downed
a bottle of whisky last night

05:27.459 --> 05:29.594
and shot her husband
smells better than you.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.930
Alright, ladies. What do we see?

05:32.931 --> 05:36.000
- .45 caliber.
- Nickel plated Colt 45

05:36.001 --> 05:38.302
registered to our victim here.
Bought it 2 years ago.

05:38.303 --> 05:41.439
- Lockbox is upstairs in their bedroom.
- They get wasted...

05:41.440 --> 05:43.774
He gets violent,
he punches her and then

05:43.775 --> 05:46.310
- passes out drunk on the couch.
- She's drunk herself,

05:46.311 --> 05:48.412
fed-up with her abusive husband.
She get upstairs,

05:48.413 --> 05:50.948
grabs the gun, comes back,
then pops three off on him

05:50.949 --> 05:53.818
from...

05:53.819 --> 05:55.987
here!

05:55.988 --> 05:58.823
Passes out, wakes up
from her drunken stupor at...

05:58.824 --> 06:00.992
- 6:50am.
- Gun in the hand, dead husband,

06:00.993 --> 06:03.361
- called 9-1-1.
- No sign he was

06:03.362 --> 06:06.163
in an altercation though, right?
No scratches, mark,

06:06.164 --> 06:09.834
no pulled hair...
fabric burns... I don't know.

06:09.835 --> 06:12.003
Something doesn't feel right.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.372
You know what? You're right.
Why would come

06:14.373 --> 06:16.340
- all the way down the stairs...
- Yeah.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.676
...go over there, sit down
and then shoot him?

06:18.677 --> 06:21.379
This is a crime of passion,
so she would've come down

06:21.380 --> 06:24.015
the stairs, seen him
and shot him either from here

06:24.016 --> 06:27.018
or if she wanted to be
face to face... from here.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.787
It's weird to walk all the way
over there and take a seat.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.756
And another thing.
The whole area of disturbance

06:31.757 --> 06:33.691
doesn't have
an erratic violence sense to it.

06:33.692 --> 06:35.726
You wouldn't pass out right
after shooting somebody.

06:35.727 --> 06:37.762
Adrenaline would be pumping
through your veins

06:37.763 --> 06:39.864
- no matter how drunk you are.
- Let's get a warrant

06:39.865 --> 06:42.600
for a tox screen on her.
There's more to this scene.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.802
Huh.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.408
She's still mad at me for interfering

06:50.409 --> 06:52.410
with my brother
in that case last week.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.712
- She hates me.
- Just do your job

06:54.713 --> 06:57.048
- and it will pass.
- Well, easy for you to say.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.517
You're not the one
who might be transferred.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.622
I couldn't have.

07:04.623 --> 07:08.325
I've never held a gun,
let alone shot a gun.

07:08.326 --> 07:10.428
Can you... tell us

07:10.429 --> 07:12.596
about your relationship
with your husband?

07:12.597 --> 07:15.499
That left eye looks pretty sore.

07:17.903 --> 07:21.605
He can't hurt you anymore.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.410
We fought a lot, yeah, but...

07:26.411 --> 07:28.512
still, I would never shoot him.

07:28.513 --> 07:32.450
- Ever thought about it?
- Sure.

07:32.451 --> 07:36.187
But I wouldn't have done it like that.

07:38.924 --> 07:42.159
What a mess...

07:42.160 --> 07:44.462
Could you tell us

07:44.463 --> 07:47.565
who this young lady is?

07:54.473 --> 07:56.607
It's my daughter.

07:56.608 --> 07:59.043
We didn't notice a room
for her in the house.

07:59.044 --> 08:01.946
What does this have to do
with my husband's murder?

08:01.947 --> 08:05.483
What's your daughter's name?

08:05.484 --> 08:07.885
Annabelle.

08:07.886 --> 08:09.620
- Where is she?
- She was taken

08:09.621 --> 08:12.723
- away from me when she was seven.
- From you and your husband.

08:12.724 --> 08:14.859
Jason is not her biological father.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.961
He moved in with us when she was five.

08:16.962 --> 08:19.130
And why was Annabelle
taken away from you?

08:19.131 --> 08:22.733
I was in and out of rehab.

08:22.734 --> 08:26.437
She ended up being left alone
one weekend and...

08:26.438 --> 08:30.541
Children's aid showed up.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.809
Did you ever try

08:32.811 --> 08:35.246
to regain custody of Annabelle?

08:35.246 --> 08:38.315
I couldn't afford the lawyer fees.

08:38.316 --> 08:40.417
What would Annabelle say

08:40.418 --> 08:44.255
about yours
and your husband's relationship?

08:46.324 --> 08:49.994
I don't know. She can be...

08:49.995 --> 08:53.030
off in the head.

08:53.031 --> 08:56.267
Probably because she's not with me.

08:56.268 --> 08:59.170
My daughter loves me.

08:59.171 --> 09:03.107
She loves me.

09:05.544 --> 09:09.780
And I'm a great Mother.

09:15.375 --> 09:18.069
Alright I got Annabelle
Martin, 15 years old.

09:18.070 --> 09:21.239
Lives at a Kingsfield Place
Group Home in Scarborough.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.708
And why are we talking to her,
again? A better question is:

09:23.709 --> 09:25.474
Why are we not charging
that woman with murder?

09:25.475 --> 09:26.644
I'm not convinced she did it.

09:26.645 --> 09:29.714
- We talk to the neighbors.
- Yeah, every single one of them

09:29.715 --> 09:31.765
confirmed that the couple
was always fighting.

09:31.766 --> 09:32.550
Mr. Bryson says

09:32.551 --> 09:34.586
he heard them yelling
at each other last week.

09:34.587 --> 09:37.222
Has her quoted as saying,
I QUOTE: "I'm gonna kill you."

09:37.223 --> 09:40.258
And she had the gun.
Lockbox's key was on her

09:40.259 --> 09:43.328
and confirmed GSR on her hands
and on her clothes.

09:43.329 --> 09:44.996
Price's neighbor said
she yelled at him.

09:44.997 --> 09:46.898
That doesn't sit right.
Most abused victims are afraid

09:46.899 --> 09:50.068
to yell back at their abusers. This
woman doesn't make any sense to me.

09:50.069 --> 09:53.671
- Maybe they were abusing each other.
- No, he had no marks on him

09:53.672 --> 09:55.974
- to suggest an altercation.
- Her left eye.

09:55.975 --> 09:58.743
Localised nature of the bruising
definitely suggests

09:58.744 --> 10:01.079
a right hook. His right hand,
look at that ring.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.081
Thick ring, that would have left
a distinct mark.

10:03.082 --> 10:05.283
There's something off
about where she shot him from.

10:05.284 --> 10:08.302
Why take a seat on the other
side of the living-room?

10:08.303 --> 10:09.421
Personal killing.

10:09.422 --> 10:11.923
She sat down, wanted
to see him die, to talk to him

10:11.924 --> 10:14.025
- before she did it.
- Get your own!

10:14.026 --> 10:16.294
I smell it now.
This is your hangover food.

10:16.295 --> 10:18.430
When she woke up,
she was covered in blood.

10:18.431 --> 10:21.766
She went over to him, she tried to
save him, she tried to hug him.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.763
Why would you do that if your
intention was to kill him?

10:23.764 --> 10:24.602
I'm sure she woke up,

10:24.603 --> 10:27.906
- regretted a few things...
- Hall, Cooper, go talk to the daughter.

10:27.907 --> 10:30.141
I'm curious to see
what she has to say about them.

10:30.142 --> 10:32.110
And the rest of you, go talk
with Teri-Lynn's friends,

10:32.111 --> 10:34.612
family, any coworkers...
Is there a side boyfriend?

10:34.613 --> 10:36.781
Same with Dune.
Who else wanted him dead?

10:36.782 --> 10:38.950
I wanna make sure
we've got the right person

10:38.951 --> 10:41.319
before we charge her.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.621
Don't think I didn't noticed
the Alvin Flowers file.

10:43.622 --> 10:45.790
That case is closed.
Why did you sign that out?

10:45.791 --> 10:48.827
There's just something
about this case...

10:48.828 --> 10:51.796
Fiona's twig at the murder scene
just got me thinking back

10:51.797 --> 10:53.965
to how we found Flowers and...

10:53.966 --> 10:57.335
I think his suicide
may have been staged.

10:57.336 --> 11:00.839
- Don't do this to yourself.
- I am not ignoring my gut anymore.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.975
Seems to me you're kind
of good at ignoring your gut.

11:03.976 --> 11:08.346
Hi, I'm Detective Stevie Hall.

11:08.347 --> 11:11.349
- This is Detective Jac Cooper.
- Hi, I'm Faye, social worker

11:11.350 --> 11:13.651
- on shift right now.
- Is Annabelle Martin home?

11:13.652 --> 11:15.987
- Yes. Everything OK?
- We'd like to speak to her

11:15.988 --> 11:19.357
- if that's alright.
- Huh, yeah. OK.

11:19.358 --> 11:21.326
- Is it cool if I'm with you?
- Yeah. That's fine.

11:21.327 --> 11:23.995
Actually, the news we have
is quite heavy, so...

11:23.996 --> 11:28.333
- Your support would be welcomed.
- OK. Yeah, sure.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.368
I'm not putting
my Air Maestros in there.

11:30.369 --> 11:32.337
- They're pristine!
- Just get them.

11:32.338 --> 11:34.372
They're just shoes, they'll be fine.

11:34.373 --> 11:36.780
Guys! Washer is overloaded,
it's overflowing in the basement.

11:36.781 --> 11:39.344
- Huh... Why me?
- You're the closest to me.

11:39.345 --> 11:43.348
You all have individual days to
do your laundry, you know that.

11:43.349 --> 11:45.683
Annabelle's up in her room
and I doubt she'll come out.

11:45.684 --> 11:47.685
- You'll have to come up to her.
- OK.

11:47.686 --> 11:48.547
Hey, who are they?

11:48.548 --> 11:51.022
Just get downstairs,
clean the basement up, OK?

11:51.023 --> 11:54.192
All of you, now.

11:54.193 --> 11:56.694
Annabelle? There are a couple
of nice ladies

11:56.695 --> 11:59.130
here to speak to you.

12:01.867 --> 12:04.402
Hey, hon?

12:04.403 --> 12:06.771
These women here
are police detectives.

12:06.772 --> 12:10.208
- Hi, Annabelle. I'm Stevie.
- I'm Jac.

12:10.209 --> 12:13.378
We have some...

12:13.379 --> 12:17.382
Huh, some bad news for you.

12:17.383 --> 12:22.220
About your stepfather. Jason Dune.

12:22.221 --> 12:25.256
Unfortunately,
he was found dead this morning

12:25.257 --> 12:27.425
- at your mom's house.
- Oh, my God!

12:29.428 --> 12:31.563
Annabelle...

12:31.564 --> 12:34.432
Do you understand what I just said?

12:41.807 --> 12:44.876
Annabelle?

12:57.156 --> 13:00.091
Just assumed Annabelle's mom
would have told you.

13:00.092 --> 13:02.460
She has bipolar disorder

13:02.461 --> 13:05.430
and she is on the spectrum for
dissociative identity disorder.

13:05.431 --> 13:08.766
She can react in uncommon ways
to situations

13:08.767 --> 13:11.469
when she's having an off day is all.

13:11.470 --> 13:13.504
Right, Belle?

13:13.505 --> 13:15.907
Not a good day, huh?

13:17.643 --> 13:19.644
We completely understand.

13:23.449 --> 13:25.483
Annabelle?

13:25.484 --> 13:27.852
Can you tell us about your mother?

13:27.853 --> 13:30.288
Teri-Lynn?

13:30.289 --> 13:33.491
Or your stepfather?

13:33.492 --> 13:35.827
Sorry. She's not choosing
to evade your questions

13:35.828 --> 13:37.795
or anything.

13:37.796 --> 13:41.366
Did your mom and stepdad get along?

13:41.367 --> 13:44.502
Did your mom
ever talk to you about him?

13:44.503 --> 13:47.805
Sorry.

13:47.806 --> 13:51.809
Sometimes I disappear in my mind.

13:51.810 --> 13:54.679
That's OK.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.582
- We all do that sometimes.
- Sorry, girls.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.351
Can you give us a minute?

14:02.321 --> 14:04.389
Thanks.

14:04.390 --> 14:07.158
Annabelle,
do you remember where you were

14:07.159 --> 14:10.428
last night between 10pm and 6am?

14:15.334 --> 14:19.170
Sorry!

14:19.171 --> 14:23.074
Sorry, I just... I just thought of...

14:23.075 --> 14:25.677
Imagine a chicken

14:25.678 --> 14:27.879
- and a tea cozy...
- Belle?

14:27.880 --> 14:31.816
Last night? Probably sleeping, yeah?

14:33.852 --> 14:36.554
Another staff, Molly,
was on the overnight last night.

14:36.555 --> 14:39.257
She can confirm Annabelle
was here. She's actually

14:39.258 --> 14:41.073
Annabelle's personal
support worker too, so...

14:41.074 --> 14:42.335
she knows Annabelle the best.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.511
So, if you could give us

14:49.512 --> 14:51.813
a call back or come in
to the precinct today...

14:51.814 --> 14:54.316
We really need to speak to you.

14:54.317 --> 14:57.319
Thank you, Molly. I saw that.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.322
Why is Marc Savage calling you?

15:00.323 --> 15:02.991
Huh... Marc's wife

15:02.992 --> 15:04.993
found out about the affair,
she kicked him out...

15:04.994 --> 15:07.329
He came crawling back
trying to play house...

15:07.330 --> 15:09.865
- No! No, no!
- No, don't... don't worry.

15:09.866 --> 15:12.033
- I'm not... I left.
- What do you mean, you left?

15:12.034 --> 15:15.837
- Technically, he kicked me out.
- What?

15:15.838 --> 15:17.839
Hold on. Pardon me?

15:17.840 --> 15:20.108
All real life, unfortunately.

15:22.345 --> 15:24.779
So where are you staying?

15:24.780 --> 15:28.116
I slept in my car.

15:28.117 --> 15:30.185
- Oh!
- But first,

15:30.186 --> 15:32.621
I drank a whole bottle of wine
to my face on the beach

15:32.622 --> 15:34.756
while listening to CNN on my phone.

15:34.757 --> 15:37.192
- CNN?
- That is the detail

15:37.193 --> 15:39.728
that you bumped on?
You know, Syria, Trump,

15:39.729 --> 15:41.730
people with real problems,

15:41.731 --> 15:43.698
perspective... All that good stuff.

15:43.699 --> 15:44.795
You're staying with us.

15:44.796 --> 15:47.369
No. I'm just gonna Airbnb
or whatever. It's fine.

15:47.370 --> 15:50.205
Stop it. I am not asking you,
I am telling you.

15:50.206 --> 15:53.475
OK, fine. Thank you!

16:00.983 --> 16:03.485
Hall! Anything from the daughter?

16:03.486 --> 16:07.155
Huh, not sure yet. Huh...
She wasn't in a coherent

16:07.156 --> 16:09.257
state of mind, so...
we are waiting to hear back

16:09.258 --> 16:11.226
from the social worker
she was with last night.

16:11.227 --> 16:13.228
Tox screen came back
from Teri-Lynn and Dune.

16:13.229 --> 16:15.397
Both tested positive
for ketamine and a lot of it.

16:15.398 --> 16:17.432
It's a miracle neither of them
died from an overdose.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.068
- So they were drugged?
- Or using. They found packets

16:20.069 --> 16:22.237
- in the basement.
- Get Aaron on the phone.

16:22.238 --> 16:24.339
He's still out there talking
with Dune's people, yeah?

16:24.340 --> 16:26.274
- I believe he is, yeah.
- Tell him to check if either

16:26.275 --> 16:28.176
of them are known users.
Maybe she was lying.

16:28.177 --> 16:31.680
Hey, Thelma and Louise! Molly
Apfel's out front looking for you.

16:31.681 --> 16:33.615
As soon as I got your message,
I came in.

16:33.616 --> 16:35.750
I... I already talked to Faye,
she told me

16:35.751 --> 16:38.086
about Annabelle's stepfather,
the... It's crazy!

16:38.087 --> 16:40.922
- Thank you so much for coming...
- Yeah, I... I just wanted

16:40.923 --> 16:43.525
to make sure Annabelle wasn't
in any kind of trouble, right?

16:43.526 --> 16:45.593
Yeah. We just wanted to ask Annabelle

16:45.594 --> 16:48.430
- about her parents.
- Oh, OK.

16:48.431 --> 16:51.933
- Right, yeah.
- You OK, Molly?

16:51.934 --> 16:55.103
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Um...

16:55.104 --> 16:57.272
I... I just...

16:57.273 --> 16:59.341
It must be my nerves, I just...
you know, you're cops!

16:59.342 --> 17:01.910
I don't know.

17:01.911 --> 17:05.714
I'm sorry. I've just been...
weird today. Um...

17:05.714 --> 17:08.116
I tried to take a nap,
but my head is just...

17:08.117 --> 17:10.117
- spinning, so...
- You want some water?

17:10.118 --> 17:12.654
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

17:12.655 --> 17:14.789
You're pretty close
with Annabelle, yeah?

17:14.790 --> 17:17.459
Oh, yeah.

17:17.460 --> 17:21.128
I... I got... a pretty big soft
spot for that kid.

17:21.130 --> 17:24.132
We... we kind of have
similar backgrounds.

17:24.133 --> 17:28.403
I was raised in the system too.
I had pretty terrible parents.

17:28.404 --> 17:31.973
- You've met Annabelle's parents?
- Huh... Just her mom.

17:31.974 --> 17:34.309
She can be a real piece of work.

17:34.310 --> 17:38.580
- Victim complex, narcissist...
- Does Annabelle ever talk about them?

17:38.581 --> 17:42.017
Mentioning either of them can be...

17:42.018 --> 17:45.220
pretty triggering for Annabelle.

17:45.221 --> 17:47.989
- What do you mean?
- Like, if the conversation

17:47.990 --> 17:49.991
is directed towards
either of her parents

17:49.992 --> 17:52.494
or even after a visit
with her mom, we...

17:52.495 --> 17:56.331
usually... lose her.
Sometimes for days.

17:56.332 --> 17:58.466
And why do you think that is?

17:58.467 --> 18:02.170
These are just assumptions.
Annabelle has never come out

18:02.171 --> 18:05.807
and made any accusations,
but... 90% of people

18:05.808 --> 18:08.510
who develop dissociative
identity disorder,

18:08.511 --> 18:11.346
they...

18:11.347 --> 18:14.182
they're almost always victims of...

18:14.183 --> 18:16.518
severe abuse.

18:16.519 --> 18:19.454
Right. Mostly sexual abuse.

18:19.455 --> 18:22.690
Molly, you were on the overnight shift

18:22.691 --> 18:25.527
last night.
Was Annabelle home with you?

18:25.528 --> 18:29.030
Actually, she had an overnight
at Brightwood Center.

18:29.031 --> 18:31.733
Huh, a sleep clinic thing,
cause... cause of her meds

18:31.734 --> 18:35.036
and we all... hopped in the caravan

18:35.037 --> 18:37.205
and we dropped her off around 9pm.

18:37.206 --> 18:39.941
Huh, and I...

18:39.942 --> 18:43.711
I totally forgot to log it
into our calendar,

18:43.712 --> 18:46.381
but you can call Brightwood,
they should be able to verify.

18:46.382 --> 18:48.383
And then, you were home

18:48.384 --> 18:51.719
with the other girls
for the rest of the night?

18:51.720 --> 18:54.789
Hmm.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.425
So the stepfather sexually abused her.

18:57.426 --> 18:59.561
Offers more motive
for our suspect right here, no?

18:59.562 --> 19:01.563
- Molly was hiding something.
- Stevie's right.

19:01.564 --> 19:03.565
- She was nervous.
- OK. I want someone on Molly.

19:03.566 --> 19:05.567
Let's spin her for 24 hours,
see where she's going,

19:05.568 --> 19:07.602
- who she's talking to.
- OK.

19:07.603 --> 19:09.737
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

19:09.738 --> 19:12.907
We dropped by Kingsfield Place today.

19:12.908 --> 19:15.243
Can you tell us more
about Annabelle's relationship

19:15.244 --> 19:18.947
- with her stepfather?
- Why?

19:18.948 --> 19:22.283
But they weren't close.

19:22.284 --> 19:25.954
- I already said that.
- Would you say she was avoidant

19:25.955 --> 19:29.524
of him? Or scared of him?

19:31.427 --> 19:34.262
- He never laid a hand on her.
- What about when you were away

19:34.263 --> 19:37.499
in rehab and she was
left alone with him?

19:37.500 --> 19:40.835
I mean, if I had found out
anyone touched my kid,

19:40.836 --> 19:43.438
I'd probably pop one off on them too.

19:43.439 --> 19:46.508
No.

19:46.509 --> 19:48.877
No!

19:48.878 --> 19:51.246
What do you know about Molly Apfel?

19:51.247 --> 19:54.883
That bitchy social worker?

19:54.884 --> 19:58.786
Her attitude is so disrespectful.

19:58.787 --> 20:02.290
I am Annabelle's Mother, not her.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.459
I would probably have Annabelle back

20:04.460 --> 20:06.561
if it wasn't for her.

20:06.562 --> 20:10.465
I don't wanna talk anymore.

20:10.466 --> 20:13.134
My head is pounding.

20:13.135 --> 20:15.236
All the pieces in place
to lay charges.

20:15.237 --> 20:17.305
All the physical evidence
points to her.

20:17.306 --> 20:19.474
She made the call, had the gun.
We have motive now.

20:19.475 --> 20:23.311
Seems a little too pat for me, Price.

20:23.312 --> 20:26.080
And I don't want to step
into a well-laid trap.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.351
You're doing laundry?

20:30.352 --> 20:32.787
Yup!

20:32.788 --> 20:36.691
- Your sheets? Did you get sick today?
- I... got my period today.

20:36.692 --> 20:39.327
That's why I stayed home,

20:39.328 --> 20:42.830
- I had like cramps and stuff.
- Oh, my God! Your first period!

20:42.831 --> 20:45.600
Mom, it's like my fourth period.

20:47.436 --> 20:50.271
Huh, I'm gonna... go watch TV. Bye!

20:52.208 --> 20:54.842
Mom, it's not that big of a deal.

20:54.843 --> 20:58.179
It's not a thing. Emma and Ruby
and Joy all were with me,

20:58.180 --> 21:00.181
- so I just talked with them.
- OK.

21:00.182 --> 21:02.550
So the fact that you don't
think this is a thing

21:02.551 --> 21:05.520
tells me that you are...

21:05.521 --> 21:08.189
not emotionally mature
to have your period.

21:08.190 --> 21:10.892
This is why I didn't come to you!

21:10.893 --> 21:14.395
Wha... Katie!

21:14.396 --> 21:17.732
- You good?
- Yeah.

21:17.733 --> 21:21.236
Just a typical
Mother-Daughter hallmark moment.

21:21.237 --> 21:22.087
Yeah.

21:22.088 --> 21:24.663
Let me get you some
sheets for the couch.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.378
Um...

21:30.379 --> 21:32.413
Why did you have
these Flowers files send out?

21:32.414 --> 21:35.216
Uh, because Harry
is coming over tomorrow

21:35.217 --> 21:37.719
and I wanted to go
over the scene of the suicide

21:37.720 --> 21:39.921
- with him.
- Huh...

21:39.922 --> 21:42.724
- Where is your salt?
- What?

21:42.725 --> 21:44.859
Huh, I just figured
you might want to pour it

21:44.860 --> 21:46.894
- in your wounds and all that.
- OK, stop that.

21:46.895 --> 21:48.930
I get enough sass
from my teen daughter.

21:48.931 --> 21:51.232
At least she does her own laundry.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.402
Hey... You know, at the group home

21:54.403 --> 21:57.572
this afternoon...
The social worker, Faye...

21:57.573 --> 21:59.741
She was having a go at the girls

21:59.742 --> 22:01.743
because they were all doing

22:01.744 --> 22:03.811
their laundry on the same day, right?

22:03.812 --> 22:05.947
Yeah. They...
they weren't supposed to be.

22:05.948 --> 22:08.416
They each have their own
specific days or whatever.

22:08.417 --> 22:10.752
OK, so... why were they all
doing their laundry

22:10.753 --> 22:12.920
at the same time on the same day?

22:12.921 --> 22:15.923
Huh... Molly? I mean,
she was with the girls

22:15.924 --> 22:17.959
and they were definitely interested

22:17.960 --> 22:20.028
in what we were talking
to Annabelle about.

22:20.029 --> 22:22.430
Maybe Molly...

22:22.431 --> 22:25.099
spearheaded some kind
of vigilante act.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.101
It's possible.

22:27.102 --> 22:29.537
I think we should
look into the other girls.

22:37.037 --> 22:38.137
Hey, partner.

22:38.617 --> 22:40.951
You were gone before
the kids were even up.

22:40.952 --> 22:43.521
Hmm. I know. I couldn't sleep
thinking about those girls,

22:43.522 --> 22:45.856
so... I did a little digging.
Check it.

22:45.857 --> 22:48.626
Joney Macintosh, the oldest girl
in the home, she was raped

22:48.627 --> 22:51.529
for years ago. Had her rape kit
done at St. Victoria's.

22:51.530 --> 22:54.632
- Pressed charges against her assaulter.
- Interesting. He get convicted?

22:54.633 --> 22:57.368
Yeah. He got five years.
Now, I couldn't find anything

22:57.369 --> 22:59.537
on Soj Reyes, but Tayla Jones,
her foster father,

22:59.538 --> 23:02.540
who she lived with for a few years
has a record of domestic abuse.

23:02.541 --> 23:06.577
And judging by Molly's saying that her
and Annabelle have similar backgrounds,

23:06.578 --> 23:08.612
I'm guessing that she's probably
got abuse in her past too.

23:08.613 --> 23:10.714
- Yeah.
- Someone still surveilling her?

23:10.715 --> 23:13.050
Huh... Aaron was. He said
she's still at the apartment.

23:13.051 --> 23:15.019
- You wanna go pay a visit?
- Hmm. Yeah.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.402
Just eat the whole thing.

23:16.403 --> 23:18.946
- You're my best friend.
- Halfway there.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.475
It's against the home
rules for staff to sleep

23:22.476 --> 23:25.772
- while they're on shift.
- But you did? It's OK, Molly.

23:25.773 --> 23:29.842
- Just tell us the truth.
- It's never happened before.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.045
So you don't know if the other
three girls were home all night.

23:33.046 --> 23:35.711
No, I don't. I don't even
remember at what time I...

23:35.712 --> 23:39.381
It's like I blacked out.
I... I woke up

23:39.382 --> 23:42.384
feeling groggy on the couch
at 6am yesterday morning.

23:42.385 --> 23:44.920
I was jittery the rest of the day.

23:44.921 --> 23:47.923
But everything was fine.
I mean, all the girls...

23:47.924 --> 23:50.226
Joney, Taylor, Soj, they were
all asleep in their rooms

23:50.227 --> 23:53.128
- when I woke up.
- Would you mind taking a drug test?

23:53.129 --> 23:56.232
No. They...
they wouldn't do that to me.

23:56.233 --> 23:58.867
They couldn't have done this.

24:05.775 --> 24:08.244
My tea...

24:08.245 --> 24:11.880
I had my tea... and then, yeah.

24:11.881 --> 24:15.050
I felt anxious, drowsy...
Like I didn't know

24:15.051 --> 24:17.052
what was happening. What the hell!

24:17.053 --> 24:21.223
I guess we don't have to ask
who made you the tea.

24:21.224 --> 24:23.726
Just heard back from the lab.

24:23.727 --> 24:26.028
They found ketamine in Molly's system.

24:28.398 --> 24:31.767
Price! I want a warrant
to search that group home.

24:31.768 --> 24:34.570
So, what? You think
they drug Molly, sneak out,

24:34.571 --> 24:36.572
break into Annabelle's
parents' house, drug them...

24:36.573 --> 24:39.408
Wait until they're out,
shoot Dune and frame Teri-Lynn.

24:39.409 --> 24:41.410
We don't have a single piece
of evidence that links us

24:41.411 --> 24:43.946
to those girls. What'd they do?
Take the transit up there?

24:43.947 --> 24:45.981
Can you even get across town
in the middle of the night?

24:45.982 --> 24:49.418
- A cab? Paid cash?
- OK. Check any CCTV footage

24:49.419 --> 24:51.420
within a 2K diameter of the group home

24:51.421 --> 24:54.423
and Teri-Lynn's house.
Track down those girls.

24:54.424 --> 24:56.759
Annabelle and Soj

24:56.760 --> 24:59.595
are at Kingsfield. OK, bring them in.

24:59.596 --> 25:04.099
Price! Search that group home.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.402
Tayla Jones goes to Camden Collegiate.

25:06.403 --> 25:09.271
- Sullivan! Pick her up.
- I don't know

25:09.272 --> 25:12.474
- where Joney Macintosh is.
- Find her, Cooper.

25:12.475 --> 25:14.943
Joney Macintosh?

25:14.944 --> 25:17.613
- I need you to come with me.
- What's up?

25:17.614 --> 25:19.615
I'll explain on the way.

25:19.616 --> 25:21.617
I knew there was more to this case.

25:21.618 --> 25:23.819
Those girls are involved.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.355
Two nights ago, Molly,
your social worker

25:26.356 --> 25:28.791
on the night shift... She was drugged.

25:28.792 --> 25:31.293
Ketamine. She passed out on the couch.

25:31.294 --> 25:33.796
- Really? I had no idea.
- And what were you doing

25:33.797 --> 25:36.465
- that night?
- I was watching

25:36.466 --> 25:38.500
The Handmaid's Tale
with Soj in her room.

25:38.501 --> 25:40.569
- And then I went to bed.
- What time?

25:40.570 --> 25:43.806
From about ten to midnight.
Then she went to her room.

25:43.807 --> 25:46.308
I stayed up on Facebook for a bit.

25:46.309 --> 25:49.511
- And where was Tayla?
- She was in the bath

25:49.512 --> 25:51.480
until eleven.

25:51.481 --> 25:55.017
Then she was in her room,
listening to music.

25:55.018 --> 25:58.020
- What was she listening to?
- DJ Maza.

25:58.021 --> 25:59.988
And what were Soj and Joney up to?

25:59.989 --> 26:03.559
They were in Soj's room,
watching The Handmaid's Tale.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.028
The other girls in the house...

26:06.029 --> 26:09.765
Joney, Tayla and Soj...

26:09.766 --> 26:12.034
You like them?

26:12.035 --> 26:15.003
Yeah.

26:15.004 --> 26:18.006
A lot.

26:18.007 --> 26:20.642
They're nice to me.

26:20.643 --> 26:23.679
That's great. Like older sisters.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.348
Yeah.

26:26.349 --> 26:28.350
Can you tell me about Annabelle?

26:28.351 --> 26:31.053
What kind of relationship
do you have with her?

26:31.054 --> 26:34.523
Huh, she's cool. You know,
once you get to know her

26:34.524 --> 26:36.825
- and everything.
- Did she ever confide in you

26:36.826 --> 26:39.061
about being abused by her stepfather

26:39.062 --> 26:41.797
- in any kind of way?
- No.

26:41.798 --> 26:44.633
- No.
- No.

26:44.634 --> 26:46.668
Did you ever tell the other girls

26:46.669 --> 26:49.972
that your stepdad hurt you in any way?

26:52.041 --> 26:55.144
My daughter is thirteen

26:55.145 --> 26:58.480
and her friends are her lifeline.

26:58.481 --> 27:00.716
She tells them things

27:00.717 --> 27:03.085
way before she tells me.

27:05.789 --> 27:07.890
Why were you all doing your laundry

27:07.891 --> 27:10.559
- at the same time yesterday?
- Oh, we had a bet

27:10.560 --> 27:13.095
to see which one of us
could have the cleanest room.

27:13.096 --> 27:15.097
I won.

27:15.098 --> 27:18.400
Yeah. We went
and searched all your rooms.

27:18.401 --> 27:20.402
Cleanest teen rooms

27:20.403 --> 27:23.806
our detectives had ever seen.

27:23.807 --> 27:26.108
Did you know
that your stepdad owned a gun?

27:26.109 --> 27:28.410
- Yeah.
- And...

27:28.411 --> 27:30.512
did you ever tell the other girls

27:30.513 --> 27:32.848
that there was a gun in your house?

27:32.849 --> 27:36.418
Yeah, I think so.

27:36.419 --> 27:40.522
Who did you tell?

27:46.429 --> 27:49.531
Joney.

27:49.532 --> 27:52.701
Have you ever been
to Annabelle's parents' house?

27:54.604 --> 27:58.440
Joney, I know what it feels like,

27:58.441 --> 28:01.510
that bundled up rage
in your guts at your age.

28:01.511 --> 28:04.446
Do you? I'm pretty sure we had

28:04.447 --> 28:07.249
very different upbringings, detective.

28:13.389 --> 28:16.892
- Got her story down to a T.
- Beautifully rehearsed.

28:20.163 --> 28:22.164
I'm just going in circles now.

28:22.165 --> 28:24.967
I didn't get much out of Annabelle.

28:24.968 --> 28:28.303
But I do think
she told Joney about the gun.

28:28.304 --> 28:31.173
- We heard anything from Price or Finch?
- Nothing yet.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.305
Did you go through all
their social media?

28:33.306 --> 28:35.368
Yeah. Nada.

28:40.149 --> 28:43.085
- Is this Joney's file?
- Hmm-mm.

28:51.327 --> 28:53.328
- Jonathan Miller.
- Yeah, what about him?

28:53.329 --> 28:55.531
Oh, he's getting out next year.

28:55.532 --> 28:57.833
That must be pretty upsetting, huh?

28:57.834 --> 29:01.503
Out? No, he's not exactly in.

29:01.504 --> 29:04.740
You didn't read
the fine print there, huh?

29:04.741 --> 29:07.342
No, he was...

29:07.343 --> 29:10.679
deemed a vulnerable person.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.848
He's a serial rapist!

29:12.849 --> 29:14.850
The judge didn't think

29:14.851 --> 29:17.719
that prison was safe for him,
so he's been in this...

29:17.720 --> 29:19.855
this hospital or something.

29:19.856 --> 29:21.857
Yes, we have a system
that repeatedly fails

29:21.858 --> 29:23.859
sexual assault victims.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.861
Is that why you decided
to take justice

29:25.862 --> 29:27.930
into your own hands
with Annabelle's stepfather?

29:27.931 --> 29:30.032
I had nothing to do with his murder.

29:30.033 --> 29:32.568
- You knew where the gun was.
- What? What gun?

29:32.569 --> 29:35.704
- Are you right or left handed?
- I...

29:35.705 --> 29:38.540
Hmmm? I'm gonna guess right.
Think if we X-rayed that hand,

29:38.541 --> 29:40.542
we'd see any... fractures, markings?

29:40.543 --> 29:42.978
Indications that you might have
punched someone?

29:42.979 --> 29:46.882
Yeah, probably. Because I box
every Tuesday night at...

29:46.883 --> 29:50.052
Joney! A man is dead.

29:50.053 --> 29:52.387
And regardless whether you think

29:52.388 --> 29:54.756
- he assaulted Annabelle...
- Regardless? Regardless?

29:54.757 --> 29:57.059
Screw that Do you know

29:57.060 --> 29:59.061
that Annabelle's messed up for life?

29:59.062 --> 30:01.730
No, no, her brain
is literally fragmented

30:01.731 --> 30:04.499
because of them.
Those people are monsters!

30:06.269 --> 30:10.572
And if you ask me,
he got what he deserved.

30:10.573 --> 30:14.276
And so did she.
He can rot away in the ground

30:14.277 --> 30:17.446
and she can rot away in prison.

30:17.447 --> 30:21.683
They did it. They totally did it.

30:28.158 --> 30:31.089
Joney's not giving me anything else
and they are all stonewalling us now.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.592
There's nothing that puts
these girls at the scene.

30:33.593 --> 30:35.619
It's incredible, really, what
they might have pulled off.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.962
They didn't pull off anything.

30:36.963 --> 30:38.931
Aaron, you found something?
Where did they get the ketamine?

30:38.932 --> 30:42.000
- I don't know!
- CCTV footage? Their phones?

30:42.001 --> 30:44.771
If they did it, they left them behind.
Location puts them at their home.

30:44.772 --> 30:47.007
- Oh, come on!
- Are we even really sure

30:47.008 --> 30:48.976
this is what went down? I know
what Joney said to you, but...

30:48.977 --> 30:52.141
- maybe she was messing with you.
- Molly, Teri-Lynn and Dune had

30:52.142 --> 30:54.089
ketamine in their system.
That is not a coincidence.

30:54.090 --> 30:55.449
The staging of the murder scene,

30:55.450 --> 30:58.920
Teri-Lynn's mystery black eye, washing
all their clothes the next morning.

30:58.921 --> 30:59.945
Come on! How did they do this?

30:59.946 --> 31:01.756
Could they have even done
it within the time line?

31:01.757 --> 31:03.791
Left their house, walked a few blocks.

31:03.792 --> 31:06.460
I checked. There is a transit route that
would've taken an hour and 20 minutes,

31:06.461 --> 31:08.462
- so... possible?
- Then they break in.

31:08.463 --> 31:11.299
They know Teri-Lynn and Dune
are alcoholics, so they spike

31:11.300 --> 31:14.135
their whisky bottle.
They wait for them to pass out.

31:14.136 --> 31:17.638
They stage the scene,
they flip the table,

31:17.639 --> 31:20.441
they mess things up.

31:20.442 --> 31:22.910
So let's say Joney knew
where the gun was.

31:22.911 --> 31:25.479
She props it in Teri-Lynn's hand.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.182
The other two stand out
of the way, make sure that they

31:28.183 --> 31:32.019
don't get blood on them.

31:37.492 --> 31:40.328
OK. We didn't find anything.
A hair, a single fiber,

31:40.329 --> 31:43.864
- anything linking the girls!
- They're wearing gloves, balaclavas.

31:49.738 --> 31:51.839
And before they leave, Joney stops

31:51.840 --> 31:55.309
in front of Teri-Lynn,
punches her in the face.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.812
Did they mean to kill
Teri-Lynn but ran out of time?

31:57.813 --> 32:00.081
- Why frame her?
- Enable her.

32:00.082 --> 32:03.284
She was drunk or in rehab.
She left her alone with him.

32:03.285 --> 32:06.320
You two, go back and talk to the
daughter again. The rest of you,

32:06.321 --> 32:09.323
call cab companies, transit
operators at the time, neighbors.

32:09.324 --> 32:11.325
Did they see anything
with the girls? Come on,

32:11.326 --> 32:13.527
- let's find something.
- Yup.

32:13.528 --> 32:16.163
Annabelle...

32:16.164 --> 32:19.000
We think that your friends
may have been involved

32:19.001 --> 32:21.335
in the murder of your stepdad.

32:21.336 --> 32:24.538
We think they may have been
protecting you

32:24.539 --> 32:28.109
or getting back at him
for hurting you.

32:28.110 --> 32:31.012
Did he ever hurt you?

32:31.013 --> 32:35.016
You haven't done anything wrong, OK?

32:35.017 --> 32:37.551
And you will never get in trouble

32:37.552 --> 32:40.287
for anything that you tell us.

32:40.288 --> 32:43.858
My mom will get mad at me.

32:43.859 --> 32:47.962
You don't have to see your mom
if you don't want.

32:57.039 --> 33:00.074
There were checkups.

33:00.075 --> 33:04.145
At nap time.

33:06.581 --> 33:10.718
That's when I would turn
into a teddy bear.

33:10.719 --> 33:13.888
And did your mom know

33:13.889 --> 33:16.524
that Jason was giving you
these checkups?

33:32.074 --> 33:34.675
It was my mom.

33:37.746 --> 33:41.682
She did the checkups.

33:43.618 --> 33:46.587
Jason took the pictures.

34:01.136 --> 34:03.771
"Mother and Daughter.

34:03.772 --> 34:07.274
October 2015."

34:07.275 --> 34:10.643
Just like twins.

34:10.645 --> 34:14.281
"Mother and Daughter, June 2016."

34:16.384 --> 34:19.920
"Mother and Daughter, April 2014."

34:21.857 --> 34:24.458
You know, my mother used
to put up pictures of me

34:24.458 --> 34:26.994
when I was a kid too.
Always wrote my name

34:26.995 --> 34:29.029
on the back of them.

34:29.030 --> 34:32.132
But it's as if you see Annabelle

34:32.134 --> 34:34.400
as an object.

34:34.402 --> 34:38.339
Your daughter.

34:38.340 --> 34:41.641
Annabelle has accused you

34:41.643 --> 34:44.978
of sexually assaulting her
when she was a child.

34:44.980 --> 34:48.149
Lies.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.484
She's lying.

34:50.485 --> 34:53.487
You met her.
She's not right in the head.

34:53.487 --> 34:55.489
And I think we know why now.

34:55.489 --> 34:59.326
So regardless of the murder charge,

34:59.327 --> 35:01.762
you're gonna be facing
an investigation by the SCU.

35:01.763 --> 35:03.931
You know what might help your case?

35:03.932 --> 35:06.167
To admit to sexually assaulting
your daughter

35:06.168 --> 35:08.836
provides a strong motive
for the other girls.

35:08.837 --> 35:11.539
I want to see her.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.341
Where is she?

35:14.342 --> 35:17.611
Don't look at me that way.
Where is she?

35:17.612 --> 35:20.114
- With the sex crimes unit.
- I want to see her.

35:20.115 --> 35:22.383
Now!

35:24.419 --> 35:28.022
You're never gonna
see your daughter again.

35:28.023 --> 35:30.891
I'm gonna make sure of that.

35:30.892 --> 35:34.461
I did it.

35:37.265 --> 35:40.034
I killed Jason.

35:40.035 --> 35:42.803
I killed that bastard.

35:42.804 --> 35:44.705
She'd rather confess to the murder

35:44.706 --> 35:46.874
than to the sexual abuse.

35:46.875 --> 35:50.144
I don't understand why
they didn't just kill her too.

35:55.884 --> 35:58.986
I'm not discrediting here,
but this is super rare. Right?

35:58.987 --> 36:01.755
Maternal incest? Rare?

36:01.756 --> 36:05.226
Who knows? Under reported,
under recognised,

36:05.227 --> 36:07.761
under researched, yes, yes and yes.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.730
She did confess.

36:09.731 --> 36:11.765
All the evidence points to her.

36:11.766 --> 36:14.034
I say we charge her,
let the lawyers figure it out.

36:14.035 --> 36:16.670
Yeah... Why not?

36:16.671 --> 36:18.939
She screwed her kid up for life.

36:18.940 --> 36:21.575
Girls were right.
She got what she deserved.

36:21.576 --> 36:24.845
Rather than some long,
drawn out SCU investigation.

36:24.846 --> 36:26.880
Turn her over to sex crimes.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.085
And when they're done with her
charge her

36:31.086 --> 36:34.188
- with second degree murder.
- What about the girls?

36:34.189 --> 36:36.957
We got nothing concrete to keep here.
It's all circumstantial.

36:36.958 --> 36:41.061
- Nothing will stick.
- Release them.

36:44.199 --> 36:46.267
But we're gonna keep tabs
on them, right?

36:46.268 --> 36:48.369
Absolutely. One missed step
and we're on them.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.704
Yeah.

36:59.481 --> 37:02.616
Joney. Come here.

37:02.617 --> 37:05.619
- What?
- Your mother...

37:05.620 --> 37:07.821
She was in Montclair penitentiary.

37:07.822 --> 37:10.891
Life sentence. She took her own life.

37:10.892 --> 37:14.161
Yeah. Whatever.

37:14.162 --> 37:16.130
I mean, she tried to kill herself

37:16.131 --> 37:18.165
twice before that and...

37:18.166 --> 37:20.401
third time's the charm, right?

37:22.737 --> 37:24.805
You know, she used
to write me these letters

37:24.806 --> 37:27.508
about how... prison was way worse

37:27.509 --> 37:29.677
than being dead.

37:32.847 --> 37:35.816
You know, it's...

37:35.817 --> 37:38.485
not fair that your mom died.

37:38.486 --> 37:40.854
It's not fair
that you went shuffled around

37:40.855 --> 37:42.823
from home to home

37:42.824 --> 37:44.858
or that you were raped

37:44.859 --> 37:46.927
when you were 14 years old.

37:46.928 --> 37:49.830
Every terrible,

37:49.831 --> 37:52.499
horrific thing
that has happened to you

37:52.500 --> 37:55.202
is not fair.

37:55.203 --> 37:57.838
And it doesn't matter,

37:57.839 --> 38:01.175
cause those are the cards
that you've been dealt.

38:01.176 --> 38:05.279
So now, you got to play
the hell out of them.

38:08.750 --> 38:12.286
- Come on, Joney!
- Take it.

38:29.910 --> 38:31.267
See you at home?

38:31.268 --> 38:33.507
I'll be right behind you.
I just have a couple of emails

38:33.508 --> 38:35.810
- to finish up.
- OK. Good night.

38:35.811 --> 38:38.813
- Good night, all.
- Huh, boss! Huh...

38:38.814 --> 38:41.883
Do you have a sec to talk about
my upcoming potential transfer?

38:41.884 --> 38:44.052
Yeah, I spoke with the staff sergeant

38:44.053 --> 38:46.154
at 45 division
and you start there in 2 weeks.

38:46.155 --> 38:48.657
Oh, that's why I wanted
to talk to you. I actually...

38:48.658 --> 38:50.725
Cooper, I am so sorry, but
I'm late to meet my daughter.

38:50.726 --> 38:52.928
OK.

39:00.102 --> 39:03.104
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

39:03.105 --> 39:05.307
45 division is pretty boring, kiddo.

39:05.308 --> 39:07.943
Thanks, Harry.

39:10.947 --> 39:13.849
You called about
the Alvin Flowers case?

39:13.850 --> 39:15.917
You're not going down
the rabbit hole, are you, Bims?

39:15.918 --> 39:18.687
He didn't kill himself.

39:18.688 --> 39:21.656
He didn't. I felt it
when I walked onto the scene.

39:21.657 --> 39:24.426
You know, the redhead murders
were all about the process.

39:24.427 --> 39:26.428
They were calculated, every detail

39:26.429 --> 39:28.597
was thought through. He would
never have killed himself

39:28.598 --> 39:30.932
in such a careless way.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.802
He would've wanted
to... create a spectacle.

39:33.803 --> 39:36.638
- What are you thinking, Stevie?
- That it was someone

39:36.639 --> 39:38.773
who knew the inner workings
of a crime scene.

39:38.774 --> 39:41.843
- What? Like a cop?
- Yeah.

39:41.844 --> 39:44.946
I know it sounds crazy, but...

39:44.947 --> 39:48.950
it was only cops who knew about Alvin.

39:48.951 --> 39:51.119
I think someone

39:51.120 --> 39:53.221
could've taken advantage knowing
that we were onto the wrong guy.

39:53.222 --> 39:56.391
But Stevie, Flowers left you a note.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.265
Salad's ready.

40:08.938 --> 40:12.807
Auntie Jay, sit beside me for dinner.

40:12.808 --> 40:15.644
Hmmm, I don't know.
You were kind of a bit mean

40:15.645 --> 40:18.313
to my best friend last night, so...

40:39.168 --> 40:41.669
What are you doing, Stevie?

40:46.175 --> 40:48.276
How did you know about the note?

40:48.277 --> 40:52.614
I didn't tell anybody about the note.

40:52.615 --> 40:54.816
I was ashamed of it.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.623
Why?

41:01.624 --> 41:04.592
Why, Stevie?

41:04.593 --> 41:07.629
Why did you have to keep digging?

41:09.732 --> 41:13.068
Let's go for a walk.

41:13.069 --> 41:17.172
Let's talk about it. Hmm?

41:19.208 --> 41:22.577
Yeah. Let's do that.

41:25.281 --> 41:28.891
Mom? Auntie Jay is refusing to
sit with me and it's your fault.

41:28.892 --> 41:31.052
Sweetheart, why don't you
go back into the kitchen,

41:31.053 --> 41:33.021
help your grandma make dinner, huh?

41:33.022 --> 41:35.590
Grandma's not making dinner.
Auntie Jay is.

41:35.591 --> 41:37.592
OK, go... go and tell Jac, huh,

41:37.593 --> 41:40.161
that I want a Margarita, OK?
We're going for a walk.

41:40.162 --> 41:43.398
- Like the pizza?
- No. Like the drink.

41:43.399 --> 41:45.834
- OK.
- I love you!

41:48.571 --> 41:50.739
- Auntie Jay...
- Oui?

41:50.740 --> 41:53.241
Mom said to make her a Margarita.

41:53.242 --> 41:56.411
- She hates tequila.
- She hasn't had it

41:56.412 --> 41:58.580
since she was in Mexico
for her wedding.

41:58.581 --> 42:01.182
Katie, when did she say
this to you? Where is she?

42:01.183 --> 42:04.853
She went for a walk
with Grandpa. She was acting

42:04.854 --> 42:07.021
kind of... weird.

42:29.645 --> 42:32.413
Stevie?

42:36.031 --> 42:40.037
