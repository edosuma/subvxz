00:06.007 --> 00:07.247
[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.466 --> 00:09.172
I brought you something.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.625
The Vanishing.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.006
A little birdie told me
it contains "The First Song."

00:13.222 --> 00:16.180
A true Siren
sings "The First Song,"

00:16.392 --> 00:17.552
at the one they
intend to vanish.

00:17.768 --> 00:21.010
[sirens]

00:21.230 --> 00:22.470
[30}
What the hell was that?

00:22.690 --> 00:23.850
[LAUREN] That's how
I sucked your chi

00:24.066 --> 00:25.101
and survived the accident.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.354
You can be whatever
Fae you're touching.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.106
[ZEE] What are you
doing here, Jack?

00:29.322 --> 00:30.778
[JACK] You leave
my daughter alone.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.355
Mine turned on me,
so what makes you think

00:32.575 --> 00:34.065
that Bo won't
do the same to you?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.116
[JACK]
Father knows best.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.001
Sorry.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.170
It's okay, I'm just uh,

00:48.382 --> 00:50.043
still gettin'
used to that.

00:52.595 --> 00:54.335
Look, can we
talk about--

00:54.555 --> 00:57.262
How things are
going with your dad?

00:57.475 --> 00:58.931
You mean Jack?

00:59.143 --> 01:01.350
Right, him, too.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.189
[sighs]

01:04.398 --> 01:06.730
What can I say?

01:06.943 --> 01:09.480
He saved Mark's life.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.437
[BO] He helped me
get rid of Zee. lt's...

01:12.657 --> 01:14.864
confusing.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.237
You ever heard:
"To know your enemy,

01:17.453 --> 01:18.989
you have to become them?"

01:19.205 --> 01:22.993
Well, that's
gonna be hard.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.074
I barely know Jack.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.125
Well maybe
that's the problem.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.169
[clears throat]

01:29.382 --> 01:31.498
Tamsin.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.675
You're, um--
here you are.

01:34.887 --> 01:38.050
Um, you called me?
About a letter?

01:38.266 --> 01:39.927
Right. The letter.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.007
Umm.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.718
[BO] It was right here.

01:45.022 --> 01:49.015
Actually, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

01:49.235 --> 01:51.942
Trick said you're
going somewhere?

01:52.154 --> 01:53.735
Um, do you want me
to help you look?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.484
Y'know, speed things up.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.988
[LAUREN] Brownie?
They're Rocky Toad.

01:59.203 --> 02:03.742
No, thank you, though. Um...

02:03.958 --> 02:05.494
Oh. [clears throat]

02:05.710 --> 02:09.123
I think that's.
Okay. My letter.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.213
Who's it from?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.636
Umm. No one.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.218
What the hell is this?

02:22.435 --> 02:24.096
Payment in full.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.930
You delivered me what I asked:
a virtuous yet lustful girl,

02:28.149 --> 02:29.889
eyes both
brown and blue.

02:30.109 --> 02:32.896
Don't spend it
all in one place.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.443
I don't
want your money.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.395
I never should've
made this deal.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.445
[JACK] I thought you
could use the money

02:37.658 --> 02:39.114
for your little trip.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.568
You always
were a runner.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.573
But there's one
thing I don't get--

02:43.789 --> 02:44.949
Laid?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.122
[JACK] Why a warrior
like yourself insists

02:47.335 --> 02:49.417
on wasting her potential
the way you do.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.129
[TAMSIN chuckles]

02:51.339 --> 02:53.375
This coming from
a man in a box.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.877
You know, with
the right influence,

02:56.093 --> 02:58.300
you could really be
something special.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.252
Go to Hell.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.088
[JACK] You should
be leading armies,

03:02.308 --> 03:04.264
not crying into your beer
'cause the cool kids

03:04.477 --> 03:06.934
didn't invite you
to the sock hop.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.397
[WOMAN] Here you go.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.068
Welcome to By-You Burrito,

03:16.280 --> 03:18.271
where you tell us
how to make it.

03:18.491 --> 03:19.731
I'm your server, Stacey.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.532
May | suggest
the chalupa?

03:22.745 --> 03:23.734
[TAMSIN]
Actually, I'll take the

03:23.954 --> 03:24.864
"I heard you worked here,"

03:25.081 --> 03:26.696
with a side of "but I had
to see it to believe it."

03:26.916 --> 03:28.747
As if this
isn't your fault.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.335
Hello, when you
stopped me from taking

03:30.544 --> 03:31.533
the hot doctor's soul...

03:31.754 --> 03:33.745
Uh, owing Freyja
a soul is on you.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.420
Huh?

03:35.633 --> 03:38.170
But, in retrospect, that
might've been a bad idea.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.342
Look, what if I told you
I could balance Valhalla

03:40.554 --> 03:42.385
and get you back
in Freyja's good books?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.964
I'd say, next time,
lead with that!

03:45.184 --> 03:46.924
Stan, I quit!

03:47.144 --> 03:48.520
And I lied.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.641
I am going to
tell your wife!

03:51.857 --> 03:53.768
--[STACEY] Whoo!
--[TAMS|N] Uh, the burritos!

03:53.984 --> 03:55.485
[STACEY] Here ya go.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.697
So.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.026
[STACEY] Whose soul
are we taking?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.237
You need someone close to
the Succubus' heart, right?

04:07.456 --> 04:08.081
[STACEY] M hm.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.450
How about her father?

04:09.667 --> 04:10.998
--[STACEY] Hades?
--[TAMS|N] Mhm.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.166
I think | just
chalupa'd my pants.

04:18.676 --> 04:23.670
[opening theme]

04:26.142 --> 04:28.474
According to my research--
and believe me,

04:28.686 --> 04:30.597
this is all the the research
I've been doing lately--

04:30.813 --> 04:32.974
[TRICK] the last time
Hades was vulnerable

04:33.190 --> 04:35.397
was when he was
banished to Tartarus.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.985
What happened?

04:37.194 --> 04:40.436
[TRICK] After the battle of Titans,
Zeus and Poseidon

04:40.656 --> 04:42.988
split the spoils of
the Earth with Hades.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.159
Zeus got the sky,
Poseidon the water,

04:47.371 --> 04:49.077
and Hades drew
the shortest straw,

04:49.290 --> 04:51.997
leaving him to preside
over the underworld.

04:52.209 --> 04:52.959
[STACEY] Sounds bogus.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.332
Hades is a massive
player, not some Jabroni.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.003
What is she doing here?

04:58.215 --> 04:59.796
Oh, you remember Stacey.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.000
Freyja's right hand?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.471
You have a french fry...

05:04.680 --> 05:05.760
in your hair.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.962
[TAMSIN] The Ancients
aren't exactly known

05:07.183 --> 05:08.263
for their honesty.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.307
Is there any chance
Hades was conned?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.976
There are rumors that
Zeus tricked Hades.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.554
[TRICK]
That Hades was enticed

05:14.773 --> 05:16.809
to draw the shortest straw

05:17.026 --> 05:20.359
by a woman wearing a
necklace of seduction.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.562
It's called The Brisingamen.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.692
[chuckles lightly]

05:24.909 --> 05:25.773
Freyja.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.199
Thanks, Trick.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.447
What are you two
up to, anyway?

05:29.663 --> 05:32.200
[TAMSIN] Oh, nothing.
Just, you know,

05:32.416 --> 05:35.374
doing a little intel.
Don't worry about it.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.342
Easier said than done.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.508
Can't believe Freyja
used her bauble

05:45.721 --> 05:47.712
to sexterfuge
Hades to Hell.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.593
Well, she lured him
downtown once,

05:49.808 --> 05:51.218
she'll do it again.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.185
[TAMSIN] You and I
need to get to

05:52.394 --> 05:53.930
the Gates of Valhalla.
Right away.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.226
Tamsin.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.602
--[TAMS|N sighs]
--[BO] Look, we need to talk.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.105
Come on, one drink.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.277
Look I know that things
are weird right now,

06:04.490 --> 06:05.900
and that you're
unhappy, but her?

06:06.116 --> 06:09.324
Uh-hm. Stacey is
my Valkyrie Sister.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.902
We share a bond.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.782
She gets me.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.704
Something is
going on with you

06:14.917 --> 06:16.578
and I'm not budging
until you tell me.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.455
[EVONY] Lauren. Lauren.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.002
There's leaking.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.923
Oh, looks like your
girlfriend needs you.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.590
[EVONY] You never said that
there would be leaking.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.259
[LAUREN] No, no,
but I did say that

06:27.471 --> 06:28.301
being human
came with quirks.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.505
Well, I'm all
Wes Anderson'd out.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.976
Make me Fae. Now.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.686
Okay you two,
enough fighting.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.930
You see this?!

06:36.146 --> 06:37.477
It's an age spot!

06:37.690 --> 06:38.679
[LAUREN]
I can't make her Fae

06:38.899 --> 06:39.729
if I can't run tests.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.524
And I can't run tests
if you don't let me!

06:42.736 --> 06:43.441
Okay enough, just--

06:43.654 --> 06:45.394
To your corners.

06:46.615 --> 06:53.987
[country music plays]

06:54.206 --> 06:57.539
I don't
feel well, Lauren.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.866
What do you mean?
You didn't say that.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.202
[EVONY] Well, you never
let me finish.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.458
[BO] Evony, if you
want to be Fae again,

07:03.674 --> 07:04.754
Lauren needs
to run more tests.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.207
[EVORY] No!

07:06.427 --> 07:07.917
No more needles.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.877
I hate needles!

07:12.891 --> 07:15.758
[BO] Well...

07:15.978 --> 07:18.139
then maybe I can
help with that.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.445
There.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.580
Okay, are you ready to
run some tests, doctor?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.747
[chortles]

07:39.960 --> 07:41.791
Thank you.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.169
[STACEY] I can't believe
the incantation didn't work.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.587
Stupid Valhalla gates.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.959
[TAMSIN] Well, maybe
you said it wrong.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.337
Ah, whatever.
I got a C plus in Norse.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.838
Uh. Yeah, exactly.

07:51.055 --> 07:53.421
Maybe the
entrance moved.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.927
Stacey, they're gates.
They don't move.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.349
Well, then we've
been banished.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.927
This is worse than
being dumped by text.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.262
What are we gonna do?

08:01.482 --> 08:04.849
I am not going back
to By-You Burrito.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.980
Well, good thing
I called backup.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.606
Backup what?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.573
What are you two idiots up to?

08:12.785 --> 08:16.198
You called Acacia? Why?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.153
This is your emergency?

08:18.374 --> 08:20.865
I said
"urgent predicament."

08:21.085 --> 08:23.667
Are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

08:23.879 --> 08:25.335
We need Freyja
to lure Jack--

08:25.547 --> 08:27.833
Hades--
back into Tartarus.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.584
Uh-huh shoulda known.
This is about Bo.

08:31.804 --> 08:32.919
--[TAMS|N] No it's not.
--[STACEY] I knew it.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.471
It's not. I am fine.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.057
[TAMSIN]
I need your help!

08:39.269 --> 08:43.353
Sorry, V-Girls.
I'm on another job.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.975
Shit.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.648
Now how are we gonna
get into Valhalla?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.975
She looks good.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.526
Think she got Botox?
It's like she hasn't

08:49.738 --> 08:51.694
aged a day
since high school.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.565
High school.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.276
The only other place on Earth
with a portal to Valhalla.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.656
Stacey! Yes!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.282
Aah!

09:05.629 --> 09:06.744
[TAMSIN] Girl most
likely to return to her

09:06.964 --> 09:08.170
abandoned high school.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.919
This place used
to be the shit.

09:11.135 --> 09:12.420
Yeah, it's shit,
all right.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.924
[STACEY sighs]
Sweet Valkyrie High.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.723
[sighs]
Sweet Valkyrie High.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.646
Hey, Tamsin.

09:23.856 --> 09:24.971
Did you study
last night?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.521
Do you even have to ask?

09:26.734 --> 09:29.020
I color coded
my flash cards.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.737
Uh, Stacey, color coding means

09:30.946 --> 09:32.061
using different colors.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.316
[STACEY]
But I like pink.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.612
[GIRL] Did you hear
about the new teacher?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.986
I heard she's an old friend
of Headmistress Freyja.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.944
[STACEY] I heard she used
to fight in real battles.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.825
Valkyries don't fight
in real battles, Stacey.

09:42.040 --> 09:42.825
[STACEY]
Well that's what I heard.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.872
[GIRL] I heard she
was top of the class.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.120
[TAMSIN]
Just like I'm gonna be.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.667
And after I win
Valedictorian,

09:47.880 --> 09:48.369
I'm going to--

09:48.589 --> 09:49.294
[STACEY and GIRL]
"Take my place at

09:49.506 --> 09:51.337
Freyja's side in Valhalla."

09:51.550 --> 09:52.835
We know, Tamsin.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.211
[GIRL giggles]

09:54.428 --> 09:56.384
What? You guys
don't think that I can?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.337
Or are you just jealous?

09:59.808 --> 10:00.923
What are you doing?

10:03.437 --> 10:06.975
Oh. I don't know.
l-l'm sorry.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.102
We should, uh...

10:09.318 --> 10:11.149
--[STACEY] get to class.
--[G|RL] Yeah.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.493
[STACEY] This place smells
like a Woodstock porta-potty.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.741
I did Jimi in one.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.289
Hendrix.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.618
[TAMSIN] How long has
this place been closed?

10:28.837 --> 10:29.872
[STACEY] Decades.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.465
Things kinda
went south after you...

10:32.674 --> 10:34.460
[TAMSIN] Uh, do not
blame this one on me.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.587
[STACEY] Own it, 'kay?
You're kinda a legend.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.214
[distant thud]

10:38.430 --> 10:40.341
Oooh-kay...

10:40.557 --> 10:42.388
It's probably
just a raccoon.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.683
This place always did
have a lock on creepy.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.513
It had etiquette classes
and a pep squad.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.393
You really don't remember?

10:50.609 --> 10:51.564
I remember
wanting to graduate

10:51.777 --> 10:53.813
so I could get
the hell out of here.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.917
[school bell rings]

11:13.924 --> 11:15.414
[FREYJA]
Please be seated.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.715
After a long and extensive
search for a worthy candidate,

11:20.931 --> 11:23.843
we have finally
found a new instructor.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.971
[FREYJA] You will find
her fair but firm.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.302
She was a peer of yours truly

11:28.522 --> 11:30.854
when I was
at Valkyrie Academy.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.024
[FREYJA]
Please welcome Mistress Acacia.

11:34.236 --> 11:40.072
[clapping]

11:40.742 --> 11:42.073
If you have any questions,
please direct them

11:42.286 --> 11:44.493
to our head girl Tamsin.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.826
[ACACIA]
All right, class.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.752
Tell me, where did
you leave off?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.339
[TAMSIN] Chapter Nine:
How to administer

11:57.551 --> 12:00.384
palliative care to a
soul on the battlefield.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.810
"Essentials of Valkyrie
Battlefield Comfort

12:11.023 --> 12:13.810
and Care for
the Downed Soldier."

12:17.446 --> 12:19.653
[ACACIA sighs]

12:19.865 --> 12:23.574
Have any of you girls
ever been on a battlefield?

12:24.620 --> 12:25.530
Certainly not.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.077
But if we ever are,
we'll have the tools

12:27.289 --> 12:29.905
to comfort and care
for a soldier's soul.

12:30.125 --> 12:34.494
You mean, you'll have the
tools to use a soldier's soul.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.295
No, ma'am.
The role of a Valkyrie

12:37.507 --> 12:38.883
is to take a
fallen warrior's soul

12:39.092 --> 12:41.048
and deliver it
to Valhalla.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.764
And what if I told you
that the true roll

12:44.973 --> 12:48.181
of a Valkyrie is
not to play nursemaid,

12:48.393 --> 12:50.224
[ACACIA]
but to intercept soldiers

12:50.437 --> 12:53.804
in battle and win wars.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.605
You're talking
about Doubt.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.729
Indeed, I am.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.187
We're forbidden to speak
of such things here.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.236
[sighs]

13:10.248 --> 13:15.709
[ACACIA] Ladies, please
dispose of these.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.045
[ACACIA] We'll start
with the basics,

13:19.257 --> 13:22.124
learning the art of Doubt.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.513
Ma'am, I don't think
Headmistress Freyja

13:25.722 --> 13:27.804
would like what you did.
I fear that it's--

13:28.016 --> 13:30.007
[ACACIA] Fear.

13:30.227 --> 13:34.561
Fear is the enemy
of the Valkyrie.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.435
[ACACIA]
A true Valkyrie is brave.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.768
Open. Proud.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.023
[ACACIA]
If that is not something

13:42.239 --> 13:43.399
you're interested in,

13:43.615 --> 13:47.153
there is a Pixie Beauty
School down the road.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.405
[school bell rings]

13:49.621 --> 13:51.577
[ACACIA]
That'll be all for today.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.251
[BO] Thought you
could use a break.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.173
And she came
bearing smoothies.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.876
How? How did you know?

14:06.096 --> 14:06.881
Well, let's just say

14:07.097 --> 14:09.634
your pillow talk
is very informative.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.090
Oh.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.436
So... Busy day, Dr. Lewis?

14:13.645 --> 14:14.430
Slow, actually.
I'm waiting on

14:14.646 --> 14:15.977
Evony's test results.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.178
Yeah, I couldn't help
but notice you didn't

14:17.399 --> 14:19.185
let her in on
your little situation.

14:19.401 --> 14:20.982
Yeah well, I thought
it best to keep my

14:21.194 --> 14:23.901
conduit abilities from her
until I turned her back.

14:24.114 --> 14:27.902
Since when was turning her
back part of your plan?

14:28.118 --> 14:29.858
Why are you here again?

14:30.078 --> 14:34.572
What? I am interested
in what you do.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.292
Or more specifically:

14:36.501 --> 14:39.368
what I do when it comes
to parental containment.

14:39.588 --> 14:40.794
You're here to see Jack.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.587
Know thy enemy, right?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.209
Mhm.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.882
[NURSE] Sorry to
interrupt, Dr. Lewis.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.506
It's urgent.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.553
What is it?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.762
Lauren, what's wrong?

14:54.978 --> 14:57.060
It's Evony's test results.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.605
What do you mean
I'm really sick?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.356
What's wrong with me?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.530
Well according
to this... a lot.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.236
[LAUREN] There's a chance
that if I turn you Fae,

15:14.456 --> 15:17.289
it could exacerbate
your condition.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.878
What's she saying?

15:23.090 --> 15:26.753
Uh, turning you Fae...

15:31.306 --> 15:34.093
It could kill you.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.300
[LAUREN] Instantly.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.932
What?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.393
No I...

15:46.613 --> 15:48.194
You can't fix me?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.907
I-lt's just that
with other diseases,

15:50.117 --> 15:51.106
I know what
I'm dealing with.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.282
But with this...

15:53.495 --> 15:54.325
I don't.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.904
Well, I do.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.581
I watch Lifetime.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.535
Don't touch me!

16:02.754 --> 16:03.960
[EVONY]
I don't need your help.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.287
I don't need
anyone's help.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.247
lam the Morrigan.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.891
Or I was...

16:18.103 --> 16:18.967
I'm so sorry.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.803
[EVONY]
I said don't touch me.

16:27.863 --> 16:32.323
Why didn't you turn me Fae
when you had the chance?

16:32.534 --> 16:35.071
Because I wanted
to test the serum.

16:35.287 --> 16:39.872
To make sure
that it was safe.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.825
[EVONY] Test it?

16:43.044 --> 16:44.875
On who?

16:47.591 --> 16:48.922
[STACEY] You'd think
a portal to Valhalla

16:49.134 --> 16:50.374
would be hard to miss.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.461
But that's what I said
about genital warts.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.137
[distant crashing, banging]

16:56.349 --> 16:59.216
Okay. Tam-Tam?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.972
I don't think we're alone.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.598
Okay, let's just
find the thing,

17:02.814 --> 17:04.475
[TAMSIN] so we
can get out of here.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.024
It has to be around
here somewhere.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.399
What is it?

17:16.620 --> 17:18.156
A mistake.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.116
I'm sure of it.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.952
I've never gotten lower than
an A on a paper before.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.663
No mistake.
The assignment was

17:29.883 --> 17:32.169
[ACACIA] to describe
the role of the Valkyrie.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.967
What you wrote contained
no individuality,

17:35.180 --> 17:38.513
no inner truths,
no personal fears.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.309
Are you telling me
that your greatest fear

17:43.521 --> 17:46.513
is getting a C minus?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.349
[ACACIA] I don't want to read
another five-paragraph essay

17:49.569 --> 17:53.403
about comforting
fallen soldiers.

17:53.615 --> 17:57.858
If you would like to write
the truth, your truth,

17:58.078 --> 17:58.942
that is something
that I would

17:59.162 --> 18:00.948
be interested in reading.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.075
I just don't know
what you mean.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.407
Sounds like someone
needs a tutor.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.910
I don't need a tutor.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.119
I am a tutor.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.298
Well then, I guess
we are finished here.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.755
Now, if the Head Girl
would excuse me,

18:19.975 --> 18:22.307
I have a meeting
with the Headmistress.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.894
I'll do it.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.272
Good.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.975
Meet me in the
courtyard at midnight.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.776
But curfew's at nine.

18:33.989 --> 18:37.072
Well then,
Miss Goody Two Shoes.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.616
Looks like you
have a problem.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.168
That's it.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.087
We can't find it
because it's not here.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.712
No shit, Tammy.

18:55.927 --> 18:59.010
No, the doorway
to Valhalla only opens

18:59.222 --> 19:00.507
in the presence
of teachers.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.466
Well, there's no
teacher here.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.051
{ACACIA} Then it's
a good thing I came.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.602
You're back! No, wait.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.054
What are you doing here?

19:09.274 --> 19:10.184
Thought you might
need someone to

19:10.400 --> 19:12.982
bail you out of your
kamikaze mission.

19:13.194 --> 19:16.106
So you'll get us
into Valhalla?

19:16.323 --> 19:18.154
Truth is girls,

19:18.366 --> 19:20.573
it wouldn't help if I did.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.741
Freyja is dead.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.291
Dead.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.368
Freyja is dead?

19:32.589 --> 19:33.704
Did she bleed out?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.333
Choke on a meatball?

19:35.550 --> 19:38.087
I really don't know
what happened.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.419
The point is, you're
gonna need another way

19:40.638 --> 19:45.223
to lure Hades
to Tartarus.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.550
So you're in?

19:46.770 --> 19:48.226
[ACACIA] If we
decide to pursue this,

19:48.438 --> 19:49.848
we'll have to keep it
on the down-low.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.805
Just between us.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.016
Goody Two Shoe's honor.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.706
Is it really necessary
to meet this late at night?

20:09.918 --> 20:12.580
I'm impressed you came.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.959
I always keep my word.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.792
[ACACIA] Before we begin
you should know that

20:21.012 --> 20:24.755
some might call my teaching
methods "unorthodox."

20:24.974 --> 20:26.680
[TAMSIN] Aren't they?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.053
[ACACIA]
Many of our traditions

20:28.269 --> 20:30.476
have been repressed
in the past.

20:30.688 --> 20:34.806
But we were given the
gift of Doubt for a reason.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.938
To comfort soldiers
on the battlefield.

20:38.154 --> 20:42.773
Our ability to read people's
insecurities can soothe.

20:42.992 --> 20:46.359
But it can also
be used as a weapon.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.572
To exploit armies
and to win wars.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.283
[ACACIA] I can
teach you the old ways.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.664
But first you must
give me your word

20:55.880 --> 21:00.715
that these lessons will
remain a secret between us.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.219
I promise.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.218
Good.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.934
Lesson one:

21:15.150 --> 21:17.015
Doubt me.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.817
[ACACIA]
Find my vulnerabilities.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.314
I can't.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.317
Are you afraid?
Or just weak?

21:23.533 --> 21:25.398
I'm not weak!

21:25.618 --> 21:26.403
You're just a teacher.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.120
If you were really
a Valkyrie you'd be

21:28.329 --> 21:31.321
doing something meaningful.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.532
Uh!

21:33.751 --> 21:35.252
Sounds like you're
getting the hang

21:35.462 --> 21:38.295
of this inner truth thing.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.792
It's a start.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.420
I can't do this.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.342
I won't.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.804
Looking over
Evony's symptoms,

21:56.024 --> 21:57.889
I don't understand
how she's still standing.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.521
Or how she got so
sick in the first place?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.193
[EVONY] That's easy.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.941
Arianrhod.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.738
P.S. Your lobby
coffee sucks.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.690
Who or what
is Arianrhod?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.196
Keeper of Time and Karma.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.697
Evony, did you two
have a run-in?

22:10.914 --> 22:12.700
When I was the Morrigan.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.201
She said all the
bad things I did

22:14.417 --> 22:15.873
would come back to me.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.996
She cursed me.

22:18.213 --> 22:21.046
Right.
But as the Morrigan,

22:21.257 --> 22:25.216
you were too powerful.
It didn't take effect.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.168
Until I turned you human.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.299
Now, in the words of Janet:

22:29.516 --> 22:32.007
what have you
done for me lately?

22:32.227 --> 22:35.719
You're the doctor,
where're the magic hands?

22:35.939 --> 22:37.930
Well doctors can't just
put their hands on you

22:38.149 --> 22:41.141
and fix you.
It's not that simple.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.777
Unless it is.

22:47.992 --> 22:48.777
No.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.325
You said yourself
his handprint saved Mark

22:51.538 --> 22:52.823
[LAUREN] and it protected
you from the Nyx.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.279
[BO] Yeah but we still
don't know if there will be

22:54.499 --> 22:56.285
repercussions from that.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.866
Get to know him
first, right?

22:58.086 --> 22:59.417
And this is the
perfect opportunity.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.666
[EVONY]
Umm, lifesaving handprint?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.383
[EVONY]
Wake up you two!

23:04.592 --> 23:06.298
What are you waiting for?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.672
I want the hand job!

23:15.728 --> 23:20.438
So, this is the Hades.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.936
I thought you'd have
a face like a foot.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.483
[chuckles]

23:24.696 --> 23:27.187
How'd you get so tanned
living in Tartarus?

23:27.407 --> 23:29.648
Please tell me
they're not flirting.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.609
So, you must be
The Morrigan.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.285
Not anymore.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.909
Sad face.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.456
That's right.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.909
You were turned human.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.619
Lauren was going
to turn her back.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.625
But she's still
working on a cure.

23:44.841 --> 23:45.591
Yeah but didn't you--

23:45.800 --> 23:49.088
[LAUREN]
As I was telling Evony,

23:49.304 --> 23:51.090
I needed to test it
on a research subject

23:51.306 --> 23:53.012
before administering
it to her.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.930
Right. Right, right.

23:55.143 --> 23:58.055
And uh...

23:58.271 --> 24:00.557
How is that subject?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.980
Very good. Thank you.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.227
Well you're in good hands.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.435
Tell that to my sickness.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.030
[LAUREN] Evony has,
among other symptoms,

24:08.239 --> 24:09.570
nuclear DNA damage.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.319
Which is accelerating
her cellular senescence.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.991
What can I do?

24:14.203 --> 24:16.159
[30}
We need a handprint.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.283
The same kind
you used to save Mark.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.662
And you as well. Remember?

24:22.962 --> 24:25.078
[JACK] I'd love to
help out, but...

24:25.298 --> 24:27.630
my touch only melds
with the flesh of Fae.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.833
But you're my last hope.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.885
Well, you'll either
find a cure or you won't.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.715
But until then,
keep on fighting.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.595
[JACK]
That's what you do best.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.848
I mean you are the goddamn
Morrigan, aren't ya?

24:42.065 --> 24:44.021
Goddamn right I am.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.359
That's the spirit.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.854
Now you've
got two choices:

24:48.071 --> 24:53.236
you either give up
or fight like hell.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.575
[STACEY screams]

25:00.792 --> 25:02.578
[TAMSIN] Looks like
we have company.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.876
A Tracker. You ready?

25:05.088 --> 25:07.454
Well, I didn't
stretch, but...

25:07.674 --> 25:09.130
Uh!

25:10.426 --> 25:12.417
[TAMSIN]
That's your cue, rusty.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.299
[ACACIA] Feels like old times
at the Taiping Rebellion,

25:15.515 --> 25:16.971
saving your ass.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.139
[TAMSIN] Pretty sure
you saved my leg.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.388
I saved your ass from
the bamboo spikes, remember?

25:24.399 --> 25:26.355
[grunts]

25:29.862 --> 25:32.148
Ah! Not bad.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.696
Could've just
given him detention, though.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.194
What? And give up
my evening?

25:36.411 --> 25:38.572
[STACEY]
What did he want anyway?

25:44.544 --> 25:47.502
Freyja? Not dead.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.124
[STACEY] Hm!

25:51.759 --> 25:53.875
[TAMSIN] You lied to us.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.380
It's complicated.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.132
Try me.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.849
I'm here aren't I?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.264
[TAMSIN] But why?

26:00.476 --> 26:04.060
To help us or
to protect Freyja?

26:04.272 --> 26:07.389
[huffs]
You don't trust me.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.394
[FREYJA] Now girls,
you know that I'm not one

26:13.614 --> 26:14.945
to put stock in idle gossip.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.615
But I have heard
some disturbing rumors

26:17.827 --> 26:21.365
of some alternative teaching
going on on Academy grounds.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.412
Any student has any
information about these

26:23.624 --> 26:25.285
troubling rumors,
I would expect them

26:25.501 --> 26:27.617
to come forward.
Is that understood?

26:27.837 --> 26:29.452
[GIRL] Mhm!

26:31.424 --> 26:33.665
Tamsin. You were made
Head Girl for a reason.

26:33.885 --> 26:36.217
Do you have
anything to report?

26:36.429 --> 26:38.135
No, Headmistress.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.381
Okay then.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.387
Study hard.
Remember: only one day

26:43.603 --> 26:46.060
until I choose Valedictorian.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.562
[STACEY giggles]

26:52.987 --> 26:57.105
I didn't want it
to have to come to this...

26:57.325 --> 27:01.034
You've never been
able to Doubt me.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.907
You really think
you have what it takes?

27:05.917 --> 27:09.580
Do you really think you
can hide the truth from me?

27:09.796 --> 27:10.956
[TAMSIN] Do you really
think you can hide

27:11.172 --> 27:13.879
what you know
about Freyja?

27:14.091 --> 27:16.582
You're not capable of it.

27:17.094 --> 27:20.336
l-l can't... I...

27:21.557 --> 27:25.675
[ACACIA]
Uh, I... I swore to...

27:25.895 --> 27:27.886
I swore to protect her.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.686
She's here.

27:33.236 --> 27:34.692
[ACACIA] You did it.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.565
You finally Doubted me.

27:36.781 --> 27:39.397
Took you long enough.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.404
That was some serious
stink eye, Tam-Tam.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.326
Teach, you got schooled.

27:44.539 --> 27:46.780
Where is she? Show me!

27:51.754 --> 27:52.869
Freyja?

27:53.089 --> 27:55.580
Holy shit.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.792
Somebody needs a shower.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.428
Looks like I asked the
wrong person to protect me.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.881
Protect you from what?

28:08.187 --> 28:11.679
You're supposed to be
the leader of Valhalla.

28:11.899 --> 28:15.232
If you're so powerful,
why did you run?

28:15.444 --> 28:18.732
When Hades escaped Tartarus,
mercenaries came for me.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.655
Some wanted to use me
to send Hades back.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.482
Like you.

28:22.702 --> 28:25.114
Others wanted me for ransom.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.820
Acacia agreed to
protect me.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.209
Valkyrie sisters
to the end.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.662
So you hid.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.668
Like a coward.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.045
[STACEY] I backed you.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.968
All these years.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.172
What do I care? You're
just a little snitch.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.515
And whose fault is that?

28:59.947 --> 29:01.107
Good morning, girls.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.905
[FREYJA] Stay seated. I'm a
bit rushed this morning

29:03.117 --> 29:04.903
as I'm re-staffing
a key position,

29:05.119 --> 29:07.110
so let's get right
down to business.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.286
It gives me great
pleasure to announce

29:09.498 --> 29:12.706
the Valedictorian of
our graduating class.

29:14.629 --> 29:15.584
Stacey!

29:15.796 --> 29:16.581
Yes!

29:16.797 --> 29:22.884
[GIRLS clapping]
[STACEY laughing]

29:23.095 --> 29:24.175
[FREYJA] Stacey will
be giving her address

29:24.388 --> 29:25.764
at Commencement next week.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.429
Congratulations, Stacey.

29:27.642 --> 29:28.802
Now, as some of you know,

29:29.018 --> 29:30.758
you will be getting a new
teacher for this class

29:30.978 --> 29:32.809
for the remainder
of the semester.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.058
Your substitute teacher
will be here momentarily.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.105
Excuse me.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.525
[TAMSIN]
Where's Mistress Acacia?

29:40.905 --> 29:42.190
Unfortunately,
Mistress Acacia had to

29:42.406 --> 29:43.395
leave the Academy.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.823
Why? What happened?

29:46.035 --> 29:48.617
Well, her teachings
were in conflict with

29:48.829 --> 29:51.992
[FREYJA] the values
upheld by this school.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.539
That's not true.

29:53.751 --> 29:54.615
Sit down.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.541
[TAMSIN] Mistress Acacia
taught us to be proud

29:56.754 --> 29:58.710
of our powers, not
shame them, like you do!

29:58.923 --> 30:00.584
[FREYJA] Mistress Acacia
led you astray.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.791
You made the wrong choice,
but you are forgiven.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.625
Now, please, take your seat.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.836
Acacia was right.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.762
We were born
to fly into battle,

30:08.975 --> 30:11.466
not clean up after
the wars were over.

30:11.686 --> 30:14.849
We're meant to judge the
righteous from the fallen.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.224
Sit down!

30:16.440 --> 30:18.977
--[TAMS|N] No!
--[G|RLS gasp]

30:24.907 --> 30:27.023
No.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.535
You're expelled.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.363
[FREYJA] Pack your
things and leave.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.869
You're no longer Valkyrie
Academy material.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.253
Are you coming?

30:51.100 --> 30:53.887
[TAMSIN] Fine.

30:54.103 --> 30:57.766
Remember my name,
chickadees.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.940
Oh and speaking of birds...

31:08.159 --> 31:09.194
If you won't
admit the truth,

31:09.410 --> 31:12.197
there are other ways
to get answers.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.742
On what authority?

31:15.958 --> 31:17.949
I am the Mistress
of Valhalla.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.581
Mmm. No. You left.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.253
Now you're just
a girl in a bad dress.

31:23.466 --> 31:27.675
[TAMSIN] But if you won't
answer my questions...

31:27.887 --> 31:29.718
you leave me no choice.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.971
You would dare
cast Doubt on me?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.516
In that case: Final exams.

31:39.732 --> 31:40.847
I hope you studied.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.183
I was smoking ciggies
in the girls room.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.188
Mm.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.861
You can't even fool us,
how can you fool Hades?

31:51.077 --> 31:54.820
[chuckling]

31:55.039 --> 31:56.950
Do you actually think

31:57.166 --> 32:00.158
that I would bend
to your will?

32:00.377 --> 32:03.585
You haven't even
graduated high school.

32:05.966 --> 32:06.921
[whimpers]

32:07.134 --> 32:08.294
I can't.

32:08.511 --> 32:09.466
Of course not.

32:09.678 --> 32:13.921
Because you're just a
disobedient child. Lost.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.097
[ACACIA] But not alone.

32:22.525 --> 32:24.186
Do you really expect
us to believe that

32:24.401 --> 32:27.564
you made Hades choose
the shortest straw?

32:30.074 --> 32:33.817
Timber!

32:34.036 --> 32:36.277
Hades pulled the
short straw on purpose.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.737
[FREYJA] He wanted
to rule Tartarus.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.822
To build an army.
What better place than--

32:40.042 --> 32:41.498
In the Darkness.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.541
What did he
want with you?

32:45.089 --> 32:48.752
I was just a decoy who
found a powerful necklace.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.592
The Brisingamen.

32:55.808 --> 32:56.672
[FREYJA]
Hades made everyone believe

32:56.892 --> 32:59.554
that I seduced him.
He knew the truth.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.385
That you're a fraud.

33:07.069 --> 33:11.187
You have revealed
my deepest fear.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.023
Now it is your duty
to take my soul.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.202
No.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.329
The overseer of
Valhalla should be

33:25.546 --> 33:28.413
[TAMSIN] the Valkyrie who
should've always ruled.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.966
Acacia.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.593
[ACACIA]
And with Hades gone,

33:42.813 --> 33:46.055
we'll need someone
to monitor Tartarus.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.363
Let's go.

33:57.453 --> 33:58.693
[STACEY] That might be
too much floral

33:58.913 --> 34:00.574
for the underworld.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.700
I won't be long.

34:11.467 --> 34:16.006
My best student.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.337
Do you understand now

34:17.556 --> 34:21.094
why Hades
chose you to find Bo?

34:21.310 --> 34:23.016
Because I'm a pushover.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.811
Oh, Tamsin.

34:26.023 --> 34:28.139
When will you ever learn?

34:37.117 --> 34:38.448
[TAMSIN]
You're leaving?

34:38.661 --> 34:41.994
[ACACIA] I'm afraid so.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.696
I got expelled.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.452
[ACACIA] So I heard.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.374
I can live with that.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.168
But I can't live with
you being mad at me.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.211
--[ACAC|A] Tamsin--
--[TAMS|N] No. |--

34:52.424 --> 34:54.836
I didn't tell them anything.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.917
I've learned more from you
about being a Valkyrie

34:57.137 --> 34:59.674
than I have in all my
lifetimes at the Academy.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.184
lam so proud of you.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.513
You are?

35:08.732 --> 35:10.723
You weren't born
to serve, Tamsin.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.308
You were born to lead.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.986
[ACACIA] Like you have
in all your past lives.

35:16.198 --> 35:19.690
You'll remember
the rest in due time.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.242
But you'd better get
comfortable casting Doubt.

35:22.454 --> 35:26.868
You'll need to when you lead
your first army into battle.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.040
Lead armies?

35:29.253 --> 35:30.834
Me?

35:32.673 --> 35:35.210
You have no idea.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.256
[TAMSIN] I'm sorry.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.303
[ACACIA] What for?

35:45.894 --> 35:48.101
[TAMSIN]
I fell in love with Bo.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.808
[TAMSIN] I fell in
love with the target.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.984
[ACACIA] I know.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.653
[TAMSIN]
What about restraint?

35:58.866 --> 36:01.733
[ACACIA inhales deeply]

36:01.952 --> 36:03.863
[exhales deeply]

36:05.914 --> 36:08.951
Being a true Valkyrie
means tapping into

36:09.168 --> 36:12.706
all your emotions,
good and bad.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.329
[ACACIA] But you can't
tap into emotions

36:15.549 --> 36:18.086
you haven't felt.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.838
And you, my dear,

36:20.054 --> 36:23.262
have felt some very
strong emotions lately.

36:23.474 --> 36:26.307
It's that obvious, huh?

36:26.518 --> 36:27.223
[ACACIA] Why do
you think you were

36:27.436 --> 36:29.802
finally able to Doubt me?

36:30.022 --> 36:32.263
'Cause you're
a weak, old biddy?

36:32.941 --> 36:34.897
[chuckles]

36:35.110 --> 36:37.692
Because you opened up.

36:37.905 --> 36:41.147
Learned to be vulnerable.

36:41.367 --> 36:45.781
So now you're able to exploit
the vulnerability in others.

36:50.376 --> 36:53.743
She broke my heart.

36:53.962 --> 36:59.173
Silver lining:
it made you stronger.

37:02.638 --> 37:05.050
[exhales deeply]

37:08.894 --> 37:11.977
Subservient Valkyrie.

37:12.189 --> 37:15.477
Leader of armies.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.353
Bounty hunter screw up.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.481
[ACACIA chuckles]

37:20.697 --> 37:22.358
Quite the resume.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.563
[BOTH chuckle]

37:23.784 --> 37:25.194
Yeah.

37:26.829 --> 37:28.285
[ACACIA]
But don't let the past

37:28.497 --> 37:31.830
determine who you're
going to be next.

37:35.379 --> 37:38.041
I don't regret loving Bo.

37:42.845 --> 37:48.010
Love is the key to
being a great leader.

37:48.225 --> 37:51.558
That's why
Hades picked you.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.352
[ACACIA] Because
you're loyal, strong.

37:54.565 --> 37:57.853
Because you always
keep your word.

37:58.068 --> 38:01.981
I knew you never
sold me out.

38:04.825 --> 38:07.783
I promised him
I'd deliver her.

38:07.995 --> 38:11.487
He knew you would.
And you did.

38:11.707 --> 38:16.292
But he doesn't know what
you're going to do next.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.334
That must scare
the shit out of him.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.412
But he's unkillable.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.418
He's un-vanquishable.

38:22.634 --> 38:27.344
Everybody has
something they want.

38:27.556 --> 38:30.047
What does he want?

38:33.479 --> 38:36.471
Freyja said he wants
to build an army.

38:38.442 --> 38:42.230
Then be his perfect
litte general.

38:51.205 --> 38:53.571
You're back.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.371
I'm ready to serve.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.620
Where do I start?

38:57.836 --> 39:01.454
You know, I've always
liked you, Tamsin.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.880
[JACK]
Before I even met ya.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.128
Your Freyja once
told me about a...

39:06.345 --> 39:07.960
young, rebellious student,

39:08.180 --> 39:09.386
and I knew
right then that one day

39:09.598 --> 39:11.213
you'd be useful to me.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.594
Well, if you know Freyja,
then you know I know

39:13.810 --> 39:16.552
you chose to rule Tartarus
because you want an army.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.514
And you need me to
lead the winning team.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.270
Being an army general
is an important job.

39:22.486 --> 39:23.396
[JACK]
It would require me to

39:23.612 --> 39:26.649
put a great deal
of faith in you.

39:28.158 --> 39:31.025
I'm not sure
you're a good fit.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.493
Why?

39:33.705 --> 39:37.573
Tamsin. l have always
loved your spunk.

39:37.793 --> 39:41.411
But you are
a terrible liar.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.713
You're right,
I can't fake it.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.756
I know a fraud
when I see one.

39:46.969 --> 39:49.460
And buddy, you're it.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.170
So, if you try and
go after my friends,

39:51.390 --> 39:53.847
just know you'll have to
go through me first.

39:55.519 --> 39:57.760
Too bad you're
stuck in here.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.057
[inhales, exhales deeply]

40:05.279 --> 40:07.190
Is that what I am?

40:23.797 --> 40:26.038
[JACK] Aah!

40:30.262 --> 40:32.127
Stop beating yourself up.

40:32.347 --> 40:33.962
Bo, if I had just
given her the serum

40:34.182 --> 40:35.046
when I had the chance--

40:35.267 --> 40:37.303
Look, you had
no way of knowing.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.134
But now you do.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.764
[30}
And you heard Jack--

40:40.981 --> 40:43.939
Speaking of Jack,
how're you feeling?

40:44.151 --> 40:46.813
[EVONY] I love him.

40:47.029 --> 40:47.939
[exhales]

40:48.155 --> 40:51.397
Finally, someone was
straight with me.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.115
I'm... sick.

40:57.331 --> 40:59.367
And I have to deal.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.496
Evony, I'm impressed.

41:03.712 --> 41:08.502
Well, luckily I have the
help of a very good doctor.

41:10.177 --> 41:11.132
Oh, you mean me?

41:11.345 --> 41:12.585
God, I hate your
false modesty.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.921
Yes, you, you moron.
Now, buy me a drink.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.013
[sighs]

41:22.773 --> 41:26.106
We got this. Right?

41:26.318 --> 41:29.435
Yeah, I think we do.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.191
To Dr. Lewis.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.489
My... friend.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.657
And the only hope
I've got.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.876
Evony I swear to you,

41:46.088 --> 41:47.999
I will never give up on you.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.250
I know.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.172
I mean, you're still
chasing the slut-ubus.

41:51.385 --> 41:52.966
[EVONY]
Talk about futile.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.339
We're glad you
changed your mind.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.385
Not without Jack's help.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.929
Oh, do not go there.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.221
It's complicated.

41:59.434 --> 42:02.517
[EVONY] Oh, come on,
Bo, let it go.

42:02.729 --> 42:04.344
He did a few bad things?

42:04.564 --> 42:06.145
[EVONY] If this
has taught me anything

42:06.358 --> 42:08.690
it's that life's too short.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.393
Especially for us humans.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.187
Yeah, Evony. About that.

42:14.408 --> 42:16.319
I'll leave the
two of you alone.

42:23.417 --> 42:25.829
[BO]
Tamsin, thank God.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.251
I thought I'd never
see you again.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.831
[TAMSIN]
I changed my mind.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.545
I would rather have you as
a friend than nothing at all.

42:38.765 --> 42:39.174
Tamsin--

42:39.391 --> 42:40.380
[TAMSIN]
No, I-I screwed up.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.511
Look, me too.
I handled this all wrong.

42:42.728 --> 42:44.639
No. I mean, with Jack.

42:44.855 --> 42:46.766
Hades.

42:46.982 --> 42:49.098
That's why
I was with Stacey.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.694
We tried to send him
back to Tartarus.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.354
Why didn't you tell me?

42:56.825 --> 42:59.487
I don't know,
I wanted to do it by myself.

42:59.703 --> 43:03.912
[TAMSIN]
For you. For me.

43:04.124 --> 43:07.491
And I totally failed.

43:07.711 --> 43:10.077
Look, we need
more information

43:10.297 --> 43:12.333
before we do anything.

43:13.258 --> 43:16.250
I think I have some
information for you.

43:16.470 --> 43:18.210
He's building an army.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.341
[TAMSIN] And he's
gonna need your help.

43:24.311 --> 43:26.927
I've been trying
to get to know him.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.515
What if he's playing
the same game?

43:31.735 --> 43:33.521
There's only
one way to find out.

43:36.156 --> 43:41.150
[ending theme]
