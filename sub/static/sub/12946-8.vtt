JAZMINE:
He  knows  when you been sleeping!

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
MAN: All right.
WOMAN: Amen.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
JAZMINE:
He  knows  when you're awake!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
He knows if you've
been bad or good,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
so be good for what?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
PEOPLE:
Goodness sake.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Think about that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Be good for goodness sake.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yes.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Whose sake?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
CHOIR:
Goodness sake.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
MAN 2:
Speak, sister, speak!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
And put 'em in your mouth.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Somebody say "ho, ho, ho."

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
ALL:
Ho, ho, ho!

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Nowadays,
people think "ho, ho, ho,"

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
means the Hilton sisters...

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
standing next to Nicole Richie.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Now, that ain't no "ho, ho, ho."

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Somebody give me the real
"ho, ho, ho," out there.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
ALL:
Ho, ho, ho!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Praise Santa!

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
FedEx, UPS.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
They can ship the package.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
MAN:
Hold on!

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I know a man
with a different kind

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
of guaranteed
overnight delivery.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
He's got his own
overnight express.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Forget Airborne Express.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll take the reindeer express.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
'Cause it's free shipping
on Christmas Eve.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Somebody say...

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
ALL:
Ho, ho, ho!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Praise Santa.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
CHOIR:

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Praise Santa.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
from the North Pole,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
may we present Santa Claus.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Merry Christmas, kids.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Hi, everybody. Hi.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Ho, ho, ho.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
GIRL:
Santa!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
SANTA:
What a jolly day.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
GIRL 2:
I love you, Santa!

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Hi, Santa!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Hey, Merry Christ--

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
ALL:
Santa!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, I got your ass, Santa!

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
RILEY:
I'm comin' for that ass!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Punk yo ass!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Uh-oh.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
GIRL 2:
He's killing him!

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
What the fuck?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
You all just gonna stand there
and watch me get my ass kicked?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Nobody had my back, huh?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Nobody's got Santa's back?
Ain't this a bitch.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
That's fucked up with y'all.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
GIRL 2:
Santa said the F-word!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
WOMAN:
Even Santa gets angry sometimes.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
MAN:
And the sixth day of Kwanzaa

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
is  Kuji--

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Ku--  Uh, uh--  Ku--

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Wow, this is really complicated.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
The sixth day is...

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Er, uh...  Kuumba.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Kuuuuumbaaaa.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
HUEY: Harold Kennedy Uberwitz

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
was my history teacher.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
He was culturally sensitive.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And on  Kuumbay--
Uh,  Kuumba--

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Uh, the elder--
Okay, that would be me.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
--leads everyone
in the  Harambee  salute.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And that goes like:

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Harambee!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay, great.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So who wants to join me
in the  Harambee  salute?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Anyone? Huey?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
You sure?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It's Kwanzaa.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Okay, no problem.
Here we go.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Harambee!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Harambee!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Harambee!

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Harambee!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Harambee!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Harambee!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Harambee!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Harambee!

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Harambee!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
HUEY:
You want me to direct

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
the Christmas play?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
UBERWITZ:
Absolutely. I-I think

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
you'll do a fantastic job.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
First of all, I don't
give a damn about Christmas.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
You don't have to do
a traditional Christmas play.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
No, you can do
whatever you want.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
You'll be fired.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Fired? For what?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
For being an irresponsible
white person.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I would really love
to see your vision.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Vision? What do you know
about my vision?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
My vision would turn
your world upside-down,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
tear asunder
your illusions,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and send the sanctuary
of your own ignorance

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
crashing down around you.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Now, ask yourself:

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Are you really ready
to see that vision?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
We'll give you complete
creative control.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I want it in writing.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
: And suddenly,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
there was with the angel--

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
GRANDDAD:
A multitude of the heavenly

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
host, praising God,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
and saying, "Glory to God
in the highest and on Earth,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
peace, goodwill toward men."

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And that's what Christmas is all about.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Mm-hm.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
You hear that, boy?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
That's what Christmas
is all about.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Actually, Granddad,
Christmas is a pagan holiday.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And Jesus probably hates you
for celebrating it.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
There ain't gonna be no Scrooges
in this house, boy!

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Look, Granddad,
it's clear from the scripture

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
that Jesus was not born
in winter.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
The shepherds, who saw
the angels announcing his birth,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
would not have been out
in their fields in December.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The Palestinian winters
are too cold.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
If you believe
in that sort of thing.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
The truth is, Christmas evolved

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
from the Roman holiday Saturnalia,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
a winter festival where men gave gifts to each other.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
They also would get drunk,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
have sex with each other and beat their wives.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
People would act so crazy on Christmas,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
the holiday was outlawed by the Protestant church

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
until the 1800s.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
As a matter of fact,
the United States Congress...

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Granddad?
Granddad!

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I'm sorry, boy.
Wh-wh-what was that?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I just explained
the entire history of Christmas.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
But it was booooring, Huey.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
You just, "Blah, blah, gay sex.
Blah, blah, Congress."

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You know,
you gotta be interesting.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You're gonna talk me to death.
Talk, talk, talk.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
HUEY: And that's when it hit me.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
The world needed to see my vision.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But I needed to dress it up first.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It needed scale and drama and special effects.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
What are you doing?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm writing a letter
to Santa.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
"Dear Santa.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You are a bitch nigga--"

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
"Dear Santa.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
"You are a bitch ass nigga.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
"I heard the mall is hiring extra security to protect you.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
"That's a bitch move, Santa.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
"I'm coming for that ass again until you pay what you owe.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
"Sincerely yours,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
the Santa Stalker."

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
JAZMINE:
I think you should do a play

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
about what Christmas
is really about.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Christmas is about how Santa
died for our gifts

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
and rose from the dead
and moved to the North Pole.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
And because of that,
every year,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Santa comes down
to forgive us our sins

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
and give us
eternal presents.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Man, Santa these nuts!

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Where was Santa
when we was in the 'hood, huh?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Santa ain't show a nigga
no love back then.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
I didn't ask for much.
Just rims. Not even a whole car.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And what did we get? Nothin'.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That nigga gonna pay
what he owe.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Uberwitz.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Are you here
to see Mr. Freeman?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Uh...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
One second.
Mr. Uberwitz is here.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Okay. He's just finishing up
another meeting.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You can have a seat
in the hallway.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Can I get you anything?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Some water?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Huey?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh, hey, Mr. Uberwitz.
This is Quincy Jones.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I've asked him to come in
and co-produce.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How are you, man?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I-I-I'm good. How do--?
How do you know Huey?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Oh, me and Huey
go way back.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
And by the way,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I hope you're not
gonna be getting strange

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
with the change
on the music budget.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Music budget?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
What the--?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
ALL:
Hey!

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Have y'all lost
your damn minds?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Opening night is less
than two weeks away,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
and y'all wanna party?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're just having
some fun.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Fun? Do I look
like Charlie Brown?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
BOY:
No.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Do I look like Charlie Brown?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
You know what?
All y'all are fired!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What?
Fired?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Did I stutter?
Beat it!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
UBERWITZ:
Huey--

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
But i-it...
It's the entire cast.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Contract.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm...sorry, guys.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
GIRL:
I can't believe it.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Hey, don't be
lookin' at me.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Don't look
at Quincy Jones.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Quincy Jones
ain't gonna help you.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Get your asses out. Now!

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Is there any money in the budget
for a casting director?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
That's right, Bob.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
A little bit
of the Christmas spirit

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
is returning
to Woodcrest,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
as Santa Claus makes
his first appearance

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
since being assaulted
by the unknown,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
but probably Arab,
Santa Stalker, one week ago.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
And you're gonna
protect me, right?

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Now, don't you worry about
a thing, Mr. Santa Claus, sir.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I got you covered.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
RUCKUS:
Now, I know

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm a very large man,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
but I'm a picture
of athleticism.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Well, hello there.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And what would you like Santa
to bring you for Christmas?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I want a--

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh, Santa, you got
a red dot on your head.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Nooooooooo!

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Ow! Goddamn!

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
That had to pierce
a spleen or somethin'.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
MAN: God! Medic! Medic!

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Merry Christmas, nigga!

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Aah! Santa, why?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
GIRL:
You ruined

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
my childhood!

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
You gonna pay
what you owe, Santa!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
You gonna pay what you owe!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
RILEY:
Running like a bitch.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Backup. I need backup.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm fat.
I can't run very fast.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I think I'm having
a heart attack

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
and a couple of light strokes.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Merry Christmas, nigga.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Damn.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
HUEY:
Okay, now...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
for the role
of the third wise man,

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
we have Mr. Fogelbury
or Denzel Washington.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I say, Denzel.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, me too.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay, and for the role of Mary,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
we have third-grade
science teacher,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Mrs. Peterson
or Angela Bassett.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, Mrs. Peterson gave
a serious read.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah, she sure did.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But I say,
Angela Bassett.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah, me too.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Guys, how do we afford

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Denzel Washington
and Angela Bassett?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't know.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Have we gotten word yet
on Will Smith's availability?

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
W-whoa, whoa, whoa.
we can't afford Will Smith.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Damn the budget!

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
What we're doing is
more important than money.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
We will change Christmas

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and elementary-school theater
forever.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
But we don't have
the money.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Contract.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
JAZMINE:
Oh, Huey.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
You've got a lunch meeting
at 11:30

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
about the sound effects
for the dogfight sequence.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Cancel it.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
The PTA is threatening
a boycott of the play

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
since you fired
all the kids.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Don't care.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
And the principal's
in your office

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
to talk about the script.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Who?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
First of all,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I just wanted you to know
we're thrilled with the script.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Absolutely
fantastic.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Brilliant.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Wouldn't change a thing.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
We just had a couple of notes.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
One or two.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Nothing significant.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
PRINCIPAL:
Let's see, uh, there's a typo

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
on page five.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Uh, there's a continuity problem
on page 32.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I think that scene's
supposed to be at night.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Um, let's see, um--
Oh, yeah, um, and, uh--

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Jesus can't be black.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
What do you mean
he can't be black?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
He can't be black.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Maybe we can make Jesus
another color.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
How 'bout white?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
But Jesus was black.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We could probably do Italian.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Jesus was Middle Eastern.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
In addition to Arabs,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
the Middle East has always had
many people of African descent,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
whom you would consider black.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Sorry, can't do it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh, right. That.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Best of luck.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Break a leg.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I can't wait
for opening night.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Riley?
Jazmine.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Riley, you came
to see Santa.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Shh!

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
: Ladies and gentlemen,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
from the North Pole,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
the reeeeal Santa Claus!

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
What the hell?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Hey, there,
pretty little white children.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
Now, look at all them precious
little vanilla-colored faces.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I heard this was the only guy
they could find to do it.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Now, I know y'all
think old Santa Claus

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
look a little bit darker
than he used to.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Ho, ho!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But see, that's
just 'cause Santa Claus

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
got a little bit
of re-vitiligo.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
See, that's the opposite
of what Michael Jackson got.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Don't worry,
no Jesus juice up here.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
That's not Santa!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Okay, who's first?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
That's not Santa.
It's an impostor!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Beware of the false Santa!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Kids, kids, calm down.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Accompanying parents,
calm down as well.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I am the real Santa Claus.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Ho, ho, ho.
Look at my belly shake.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
The heartbreaker re-vitiligo

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
is a very serious
life-threatening condition.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Hey, I've been in show business
a long time, Huey.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
This kind of thing comes
with the territory.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I know you'll do
the right thing.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
UBERWITZ:
Huey, it could still be

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
a great play.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
We could cut a few scenes.
Make some changes to the script.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Huey.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
We have
to put something on.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Do what you have to do.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Just take my name off of it.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Won't be my vision.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Hello.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah. Yeah, it's resolved.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
We'll be ready to put
the play on tomorrow.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Why doesn't
the real Santa come?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
'Cause there ain't
no real Santa.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
HUEY: We all want to believe

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in miracles on Christmas.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
All of us.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
RUCKUS:
No Santa Claus?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, I'd expect
a heathen nigglet like Riley

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
to say something like that.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
But, Jazmine,
I'm surprised at you.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Being a mulatto and all,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
you've supposed
to have more sense.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Huh?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm Special Agent Ruckus.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Shh!

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Volunteer Santa Security.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Santa has reason to believe

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
that your little
jungle friend Riley

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
may be the Santa Stalker.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
That makes perfect sense.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Mm-hm. Santa couldn't
come this year.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Just wasn't safe.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Maybe next year.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
So...he's real?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Real as the Irish blood
charging through my veins.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
HUEY: But Christmas miracles

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
only happen

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
in the lies adults tell to children.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
And maybe in Christmas specials.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Mr. Uberwitz put on the play as scheduled.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Not a single word was changed.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And so, by some miracle,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
the world saw my vision that night.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
The Adventures of Black Jesus

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
received a 20-minute standing ovation.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
It was called "a stunning revolution in theatre"

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
by the  Woodcrest Post Gazette.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Unfortunately, the PTA protest had gained some ground.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Seems that people didn't care about my vision.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
They cared about seeing their kids on stage.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Who knew?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
JAZMINE:
Yay, Huey!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yay!

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Mr. Uberwitz was fired for disobeying orders

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and for generally being an irresponsible white person.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
UBERWITZ: Harambee!

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
ALL: Harambee!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Harambee!

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
ALL: Harambee!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
HUEY:  ■ He would later become

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
a professor

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
of African American Studies at the University of Maryland.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
No video exists of the one-time-only performance

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
of  The Adventures
of Black Jesus.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Just as well. I hate looking at my old work.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Ahhh!

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
I heard you work for Santa.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
I got a message for him.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Tell him Riley said,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I'll be waiting for his ass
next Christmas.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And that nigga better pay
what he owe!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Ow!
