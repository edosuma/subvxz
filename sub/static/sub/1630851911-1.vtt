00:11.200 --> 00:14.960
BASED ON AN UNSOLVED CRIME

00:16.320 --> 00:20.360
FEBRUARY 28, 1986 - 11:21 P.M.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.080
Olof!

00:35.680 --> 00:37.400
-He shot him.
-Olof!

00:37.480 --> 00:40.000
-Did you see?
-He's running over there.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.400
Can someone help me?

00:45.720 --> 00:47.080
Olof!

00:47.760 --> 00:50.640
Can you help me? He's dying!

00:51.320 --> 00:55.640
Yes, you have to call the police.
A guy's been shot on Sveavägen.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.000
-Grab here.
-Be careful!

01:08.800 --> 01:09.920
-Stop!
-Wait.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.240
-You're killing him!
-Wait. Wait a minute.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.120
-They're helping him.
-Let go!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.560
-Let go!
-Calm down.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.080
Calm down.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.280
They're going to help him.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.320
-Let go!
-Calm down!

01:24.400 --> 01:28.760
Switchboard here. There's been
a shooting at Sveavägen/Tunnelgatan.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.800
POLICE

01:35.400 --> 01:37.320
There's a shooting on Sveavägen.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.640
All units, shooting on Sveavägen.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.400
He's dying!

01:55.200 --> 01:56.720
You have to help him!

01:56.800 --> 01:58.520
-What happened?
-He was shot!

01:58.600 --> 02:00.120
Did anyone see the shooter?

02:19.080 --> 02:20.440
Yes, roger that.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.880
-Hey.
-Hi. It's a single perpetrator.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.200
He's got a few minutes' head start.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.320
-Okay. Have we got a description?
-He ran up those stairs.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.440
-I asked for a description!
-Go after him! Don't just stand around!

02:34.520 --> 02:37.320
Guys, come with me. Come on. Follow me.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.400
Losandras with me. The rest, that way.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.640
It's a lone gunman.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.600
Like this.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.000
He can't die!

03:38.720 --> 03:42.160
-Save my husband.
-Do you want to wait in the car?

03:42.880 --> 03:44.200
What's your name?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.560
Are you insane? Don't you recognize me?

03:46.640 --> 03:49.920
I'm Lisbeth Palme.
That's Olof lying there.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.840
Palme? The Prime Minister?

03:54.800 --> 03:55.800
One, two, up!

04:15.400 --> 04:17.360
Yes, it's about the shooting.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.080
The victim is the Prime Minister.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.240
I repeat,
the victim is the Prime Minister.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.360
Stig!

05:26.400 --> 05:27.560
What's wrong?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.440
What happened?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.680
Stig?

05:32.440 --> 05:33.960
He's drunk.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.800
Out there.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.640
He's…

05:38.360 --> 05:39.400
dead.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.400
-Is it really Olof Palme?
-Yes.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.440
-Yes. Oh, my God.
-Yes.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.600
-It's… It's hard to believe.
-Yeah, I know.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.840
And he's dead?

05:55.360 --> 06:00.280
-He hasn't been pronounced dead, but…
-No, but you can assume as much.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.600
-Confirm.
-Yes.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.400
Okay, and it--

06:03.480 --> 06:06.320
His wife's in the room with the nurse.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.880
Does your back hurt?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.200
I don't know.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.520
I'm going to examine you.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.720
It stings.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.760
Yes, I can see you've got two wounds.
I think you were shot as well,

06:23.840 --> 06:26.840
but the bullet seems
to have just grazed you.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.600
You have to save Olof.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.280
I'm going to wash and dress the wound.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.280
Call home, Stig.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.920
Yeah.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.200
-Do you remember what the man looked like?
-No.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.560
I don't remember.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.880
Do you remember his clothes?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.160
He was dark.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.960
-He was wearing a dark jacket.
-A jacket?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.440
What kind of jacket?

07:32.440 --> 07:34.040
A quilted jacket.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.040
It was quite long.
It went down to here or here.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.280
And he was dark?

07:43.360 --> 07:47.600
Yes, he was big and dark.
Dark-haired, I mean.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.280
And his face?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.520
I don't remember. I didn't see.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.360
I saw him running.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.200
He turned around, but I didn't see…

08:13.560 --> 08:15.200
My deepest condolences.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.880
No, no, no.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.080
No, no, no.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.600
No, no, no…

08:26.480 --> 08:28.680
No, no, no!

08:39.440 --> 08:40.600
No!

08:50.680 --> 08:51.720
Mårten…

08:54.640 --> 08:57.240
What I said would happen happened.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.040
What we were so afraid of.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
What I said would happen happened.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.720
PRIME MINISTER OLOF PALME IS DEAD
HE WAS SHOT TONIGHT IN STOCKHOLM

09:12.040 --> 09:13.080
Stig.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.000
Stig.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.280
Yes.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.760
Are you okay?

09:18.840 --> 09:19.880
What happened?

09:20.520 --> 09:23.120
-Did you see what happened?
-Yes.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.360
You sounded devastated on the phone.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.480
-Hey.
-No, I have to sleep.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.520
OLOF PALME IS DEAD

10:24.600 --> 10:26.320
Mom's about to fall asleep.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.240
You were at the movie theater, at Grand.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.040
Dad, Mom, my girlfriend, and me.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.480
And…

10:53.120 --> 10:55.440
this was just before the murder?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.080
Yes.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.160
We parted ways a few minutes before.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.320
Did you see anything
at the movie theater that…

11:13.320 --> 11:14.400
I think so.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.120
I saw a man.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.160
He was window-shopping.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.640
He was wearing a blue quilted jacket
that fell below his thighs.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.360
He had his hands in his jacket pockets.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.000
And he had a hat
with some sort of clasp on it.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.800
Anything else?

11:41.120 --> 11:44.800
He had round, wire-rimmed glasses.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.000
Yes, I'm sorry.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.560
I understand that it's important,
but I can only--

12:24.640 --> 12:28.680
Why the hell do I have to read
in the newspaper that Palme was shot?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.360
Why didn't you call me?

12:30.440 --> 12:31.440
You were asleep.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.800
It was Gösta's decision.
We thought you should rest up.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.920
Rest up? Are you insane?
We've lost several hours because of this.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.640
-What reinforcements have you called in?
-We wanted to wait.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.040
Arne Irvell,
head of the National Homicide Unit.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.720
I'm at Central Command,

12:54.800 --> 12:58.600
and I want you to call in
all available personnel, immediately!

12:59.120 --> 13:03.200
Call them in as well.
I want everybody here. Immediately!

13:05.640 --> 13:08.400
Who's leading
the crime scene investigation?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.280
At the moment, no one.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.040
No one? What the hell do you mean?

13:15.120 --> 13:16.800
Well, they called it off.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.160
Called it off? When?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.600
What time was it? Maybe half past one.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.360
Call me a car.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.480
-I don't know if we have--
-I said call me a car!

13:58.600 --> 14:01.320
-Have you found anything?
-Nothing significant.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.760
Look at the state of this place.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.080
Have people been trampling around here?

14:14.920 --> 14:15.880
Hey.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.520
-I think we've found the bullet.
-I found it over there.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.320
…dismay.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.120
That Olof Palme didn't have bodyguards
at the time of the murder

15:13.200 --> 15:15.480
has also gained a lot of attention.

15:16.040 --> 15:21.480
It may be a while before in-depth
commentary and analysis are available.

15:23.200 --> 15:27.120
Olof Palme had many friends in London,
both in the Labour Party

15:27.200 --> 15:30.440
and in the social-democratic party FTP.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.880
Palme has always been
an important person in France.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.040
Stig.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.520
Yes?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.400
-Have you heard what happened?
-Yes.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.280
I mean…
You can hardly believe it's true, right?

16:01.480 --> 16:04.920
No, I can.
I was there when it happened.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.320
You were there?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.280
When-- When it happened?

16:09.360 --> 16:11.360
Not when it happened, but it…

16:11.440 --> 16:14.400
Right after.
I was on my way home, and I heard…

16:14.480 --> 16:16.600
I heard the shots, and I…

16:16.680 --> 16:17.800
Yeah.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.280
-So, you were first on the scene?
-Yes, one of the first.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.240
Oh, that's horrible.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.560
But how…?

16:33.520 --> 16:35.560
Now over to the press conference

16:35.640 --> 16:39.240
with Sweden's acting Prime Minister,
Ingvar Carlsson.

16:40.120 --> 16:46.520
Olof Palme's commitment and loyalty
to the oppressed has created…

16:46.600 --> 16:47.600
What does it say?

16:47.680 --> 16:49.200
…pride in many…

16:49.280 --> 16:51.000
Have they caught anyone?

16:51.080 --> 16:54.720
That the person who has
more than anyone fought violence

16:54.800 --> 16:56.720
and worked towards peace…

16:56.800 --> 16:59.400
SHOT IN THE CHEST BY UNKNOWN MAN

16:59.480 --> 17:02.080
Police are looking for a man in his 30s.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.760
He has a hat, possibly a dark jacket.
He may have dark hair.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.800
…for the party and the country?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.680
That's a description of you.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.840
It's a terrible loss…

17:24.160 --> 17:26.200
Hi, my name is Stig Engström.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.280
I'd like to speak to the editor in chief.
It's urgent.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.600
Thank you.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.800
Hi, my name is Stig Engström.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.320
I've got some things to say
regarding your article on the murder. I…

17:39.400 --> 17:42.080
I was there,
right after the shots were fired.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.480
And…

17:44.600 --> 17:47.000
Yes, one-- one of the first ones.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.360
I'd like to add some things
to today's article…

17:52.080 --> 17:53.040
So…

17:55.520 --> 17:56.640
Yes.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.120
Lahällsvägen 64.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.640
In Täby.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.800
You're most welcome.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.320
Yes. No, no problem. Thanks. Bye.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.280
I guess we won't be going
to the mountains today.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.640
-Hi.
-Hi, Klas, Svenska Dagbladet.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.160
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.640
-Hi, Karin.
-Margareta, welcome.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.560
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.240
-Stig, welcome.
-Thanks for having us.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.240
Have a seat.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.600
-Hi, Karin.
-Hi, Stig. Come in.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.440
Yes. Please, have a seat.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.360
OLOF PALME DEAD
SHOT LAST NIGHT

18:53.880 --> 18:54.960
Great.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
Can you hold up the newspaper?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.880
Perfect. One more.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.600
So, the description refers to you,
not the murderer?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.560
Yes, there must
have been some kind of mix-up.

19:16.200 --> 19:20.480
Start at the beginning.
How close to the crime scene were you?

19:21.360 --> 19:24.720
Well, I had just left work

19:25.320 --> 19:29.160
and was on my way to the subway entrance.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.240
I must have been about 20 meters away.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.160
And how much did you see?

19:37.440 --> 19:40.000
I didn't see the actual shots. The…

19:40.720 --> 19:43.480
streets are noisy, so I didn't realize…

19:44.000 --> 19:46.800
But when I looked up,

19:46.880 --> 19:51.320
I saw a man lying in the street.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.400
And what did you do?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.640
Well, I rushed over to help him.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.600
It was me and a young girl.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.960
Together, we…

20:06.600 --> 20:11.560
we turned him over and placed him face up.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.960
He was lying there with his eyes closed.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.200
He was bleeding from his nose and mouth.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.480
Stig, what…

20:26.680 --> 20:28.880
What was going through your head?

20:28.960 --> 20:32.480
You don't really think so much. You…

20:32.560 --> 20:34.880
You just do what has to be done.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.120
But obviously, it was a profoundly…

20:40.680 --> 20:42.480
distressing experience.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.280
-Thank you for speaking to us.
-Of course.

20:53.040 --> 20:53.920
Yes.

20:54.840 --> 20:59.080
Okay, as you know,
we're several hours behind.

20:59.160 --> 21:03.880
Because of this,
we've already received thousands of leads.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.480
Your job is to go through them
and at the same time,

21:08.080 --> 21:11.800
receive and sort through new leads.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.520
So, congratulations!

21:15.120 --> 21:17.080
Okay, that's it. Get to work.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.200
Thank you.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.320
Let's go!

21:19.400 --> 21:22.320
If you don't have a phone, get one here.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.800
Long story short,
we won't make it to Idre today.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.080
It'll be Monday or Tuesday.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.240
No, it's because of the…

21:34.800 --> 21:38.080
the Palme murder.
I happened to pass by shortly afterwards.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.120
Yes.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.120
Yes, so I've been
called in for questioning.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.160
Yes, you see…

21:46.240 --> 21:48.040
Yes, so we'll be in touch.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.120
Yes. Thank you. Bye.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.920
Why are you saying that?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.480
That you've been called in?

22:01.800 --> 22:03.920
Hi, Roland. It's Stig Engström.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.200
I've got an odd request.

22:06.280 --> 22:11.960
Could you find out exactly when
I clocked out from work yesterday evening?

22:14.040 --> 22:17.440
So… Yes. When can you get back to me?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.680
Yes, it's important.
You see, I was working late

22:21.760 --> 22:25.880
and found myself
in the middle of that murder drama.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.040
Yes, it's horrible. It's despicable.

22:29.720 --> 22:34.000
Now the police and the newspapers
are on me like vultures.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.320
Yes, and--

22:38.400 --> 22:40.080
So you'll call me later?

22:41.400 --> 22:45.080
Great, Roland. Thank you.
We'll keep in touch. Goodbye. Bye.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.120
Hans?

23:19.200 --> 23:22.320
-Weren't you competing in Vasaloppet?
-My office! Now!

23:29.720 --> 23:30.680
A hat?

23:31.320 --> 23:35.760
-What kind of hat?
-It appears to be the kind with ear flaps.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.240
Anything else?

23:38.080 --> 23:41.120
No, that's all we have
in terms of a description.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.040
Escape route?

23:42.120 --> 23:44.920
David Bagares gata, but…

23:45.840 --> 23:49.760
then we're uncertain.
He disappeared along the side streets.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.640
-Who's leading the investigation?
-Me, I guess.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.360
I've been in contact with the government

23:56.240 --> 23:59.480
and made sure that
the investigation efforts--

23:59.560 --> 24:00.960
-And the rest?
-Well…

24:01.040 --> 24:05.080
Irvell from the National Homicide Unit
is handling the investigation.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.120
I'm taking over.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.680
-What?
-I'm taking over the investigation.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.360
But can you, as county police chief…?

24:16.960 --> 24:18.520
I'm the highest-ranking officer.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.280
I should lead the hunt
for the Prime Minister's murderer.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.880
-Wouldn't it be better, Hans--
-I've got connections to the government.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.120
They can trust me.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.040
I can bypass
the Security Service's restrictions,

24:35.120 --> 24:37.320
and the journalists eat out of my hand.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.960
We just can't let
some promoted detective handle this.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.600
They'll eat him alive. It's too big.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.040
When's the press conference?

24:49.800 --> 24:50.800
In 15 minutes.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.520
It'll be broadcast live on TV.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.240
Perfect.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.320
Welcome to this press conference.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.040
I don't have a lot of details
to share with you,

25:06.640 --> 25:09.720
but I think it's important to tell you

25:09.800 --> 25:13.560
as much or as little
as we know at this stage.

25:15.640 --> 25:20.000
At the moment,
about 150 police officers are working

25:20.080 --> 25:22.120
on this investigation in Stockholm.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.880
We have a picture…

25:25.320 --> 25:26.760
of the perpetrator…

25:27.600 --> 25:32.960
that I'd like to share with you,
and through you, with the public.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.880
The information is as follows.

25:35.960 --> 25:36.920
It's a man.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.160
He's between 30 and 45 years old.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.440
He's got dark hair.
He's between 170 and 180 cm tall.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.080
At the time, he was wearing dark clothes.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.240
He was probably wearing

25:53.320 --> 25:57.920
a blue quilted jacket and dark trousers.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.440
He was also probably wearing a hat,

26:03.960 --> 26:07.400
the kind with…

26:08.440 --> 26:11.840
ear flaps that can be fastened
on top of the head.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.120
As for the motive…

26:15.200 --> 26:20.000
at the moment,
we can't rule out any kind of motive.

26:20.960 --> 26:24.480
We don't know
if it was politically motivated

26:24.560 --> 26:30.360
or if there was some other motive
behind this act.

26:31.840 --> 26:37.040
There's nothing to indicate that there
was more than one perpetrator involved.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.800
I'd like to be connected to the officer
in charge of the investigation.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.920
I have information about the Palme murder.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.520
Thank you.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.080
…but we obviously can't rule that out.

27:38.040 --> 27:43.480
When I reached the crime scene,
a few people had already gathered there.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.080
I looked around, and…

27:46.680 --> 27:51.880
when I looked towards Tunnelgatan,
I saw a…

27:52.400 --> 27:56.200
a young man with a blue quilted jacket.

27:56.280 --> 27:59.960
There was a lot of chaos at the scene.

28:00.040 --> 28:06.480
A number of policemen arrived
and set off up the stairs.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.800
I spoke to Mrs. Palme,

28:09.880 --> 28:16.400
who told me that the perpetrator
was wearing a dark blue quilted jacket,

28:16.480 --> 28:22.200
but that she hadn't had time
to inform the pursuing policemen.

28:22.280 --> 28:27.640
I ran after the policemen to inform them,

28:27.720 --> 28:31.520
but at that point, they were so far ahead

28:31.600 --> 28:38.360
that after a while, I gave up
and returned to the crime scene.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.960
Now, at the press conference,

28:41.040 --> 28:45.560
I heard a description
that fits me all too well.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.680
It makes me think
that there's been a mix-up.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.920
That… That one of the witnesses
has confused me with the murderer.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.680
Hans, it's good to see you.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.720
I can't imagine what you're going through.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.280
Leading the government,
that's not something I've wished to do.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.840
Especially not under these circumstances.

29:18.120 --> 29:23.520
But we're so relieved
that you're leading the investigation.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.480
Someone we know. Someone we trust.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.480
It wasn't an easy decision.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.840
I understand that.

29:31.080 --> 29:36.760
The government will put all
of its resources at your disposal.

29:36.840 --> 29:41.000
Sverker at the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs is happy to share

29:41.080 --> 29:43.720
what he knows
about international terrorism.

29:44.960 --> 29:49.120
I'm sure that you
will have to work internationally.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.800
-Most likely.
-Yes.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.000
Please.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.240
No, nothing that I…

29:57.040 --> 29:58.160
can recall.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.600
Obviously, he was
always under some kind of threat,

30:03.680 --> 30:07.040
but he never mentioned anything specific.

30:07.120 --> 30:11.040
Ulf, as Olof's Secretary of State,
have you noticed anything?

30:11.120 --> 30:12.680
No, nothing.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.400
And then there's Lisbeth.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.400
She's terribly shocked, of course.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.920
We'd be very grateful
if you could treat her

30:22.000 --> 30:25.480
with the utmost respect
and consideration.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.080
Okay.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.000
She doesn't want to be recorded.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.280
She knows you have to question her,

30:34.360 --> 30:39.080
and she will of course cooperate,
but she doesn't want you to record it.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.280
And she wants you to question her.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.120
-Only you.
-Of course.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.880
Naturally.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.840
Okay, fellas. This is your new home.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.360
It will be
until we catch whoever's behind this.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.800
In ten years, you'll be proud of this.

31:04.160 --> 31:09.160
You'll be able to say you were there
when we caught Olof Palme's murderer.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.160
Over there,
you have the leaders of the investigation.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.880
Eleven selected men.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.160
-Are you one of them?
-Our best officers.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.440
No.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.360
-Are you joking?
-No.

31:24.440 --> 31:28.520
That's where
the operational decisions are made.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.120
Okay, we're getting even more flowers.

31:35.440 --> 31:40.640
That just shows how much
the people out there support you.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.160
We won't let them down.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.400
Get to work!

32:00.120 --> 32:04.360
What the hell is that?
Hans Holmér isn't even a cop!

32:05.200 --> 32:06.320
Sure he is.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.840
-He was a goddamn county judge.
-Really? When?

32:10.400 --> 32:11.840
In the late 1950s.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.360
It's a fucking joke.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.640
The bastard appointed himself
head of the investigation.

32:16.720 --> 32:20.200
He's never even conducted
a murder investigation.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.560
There's a first time for everything.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.040
Then he puts together
a team without you, Arne.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.600
What the hell? He's out of his mind!

32:28.680 --> 32:30.600
Yes, but I'm just grateful.

32:30.680 --> 32:35.520
Now maybe I can do something useful.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.880
-Even I would've been--
-Drop it! Drop it, Lennart.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.920
Here we have…

32:44.320 --> 32:48.480
Adolf Fredriks kyrka
and this is the movie theater, Grand.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.840
At 11:09 p.m.,
the Palme couple leave the theater

32:52.920 --> 32:56.720
and head south along Sveavägen.

32:56.800 --> 33:01.120
Exactly 12 minutes later, at 11:21 p.m.,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.880
Palme is shot here,

33:03.960 --> 33:07.800
at the corner
of Tunnelgatan and Sveavägen.

33:07.880 --> 33:12.480
Now we're going to map out
this entire fucking area.

33:13.200 --> 33:18.560
We're going to find out who was here,
as well as when, how, and why.

33:19.200 --> 33:23.040
We're going to question
every damn one of them.

33:23.120 --> 33:27.360
What we know for sure
is that Olof Palme was shot

33:27.440 --> 33:33.600
with a revolver,
Smith & Wesson, .357 caliber.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.480
It was one of these two models.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.320
The Prime Minister of Sweden

33:49.400 --> 33:54.680
was murdered when he, like any Swede,

33:54.760 --> 33:58.680
was walking freely and safely
along the streets and in the squares.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.400
Hello, Engström.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.760
Hi, Roland. Great.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
Yes, please.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.240
Hang on. What did you say? At 11…

34:15.280 --> 34:16.320
At 11:19 p.m.?

34:17.120 --> 34:20.920
And you're sure about that?
I couldn't have clocked out later?

34:21.800 --> 34:24.960
I left the building at 11:19 p.m.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.560
No, you can't call the police.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.640
They have to hear this from me.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.440
Yes, but thanks. Thanks for the help.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.520
We'll be in touch. Bye.

35:02.320 --> 35:07.960
POLICE SEEK ADDITIONAL TIPS

35:18.080 --> 35:22.320
PALME SHOT DEAD ON THE STREET
THE MURDER COULD HAVE BEEN PLANNED

35:22.400 --> 35:25.640
Information is scarce,
but according to the description,

35:25.720 --> 35:27.920
the man had thin lips and glasses.

36:20.080 --> 36:24.080
OLOF PALME - ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS

36:24.160 --> 36:28.960
THANK YOU, O. PALME, FOR YOUR EFFORTS

36:29.040 --> 36:32.000
YOU WERE A LIGHT
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE THIRD WORLD

36:32.080 --> 36:37.440
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US IN OUR HEARTS
THE IRANIANS

36:55.920 --> 36:58.040
WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH

37:01.440 --> 37:04.360
-What were you thinking?
-I don't know. I…

37:05.360 --> 37:07.840
I wasn't thinking. I just ran after him.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.840
-After the murderer?
-Yes.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.400
Wasn't that dangerous?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.320
Yes, probably.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.040
I guess I was lucky not to catch him.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.600
And that's when people got you mixed up?

37:19.680 --> 37:21.520
Yes, I think so.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.680
So now…
Now I can't wear my favorite hat anymore.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.080
-Stig.
-Yes.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.320
Norska Aftonposten is on the phone.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.280
-Should I tell them you're busy?
-Yes. No! I'll take it, in my office.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.880
The thing that I'll probably never forget
are those final moments.

37:40.760 --> 37:44.240
When we did everything we could
to save his life,

37:45.280 --> 37:50.200
and I felt his pulse
fading against my fingers.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.720
It… That's something
I'll always have to carry with me.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.600
1,000 NEW TIPS A DAY

38:06.240 --> 38:08.120
His cheekbones were…

38:09.320 --> 38:10.280
plump.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.560
His…

38:17.240 --> 38:18.640
upper lip was white.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.040
His-- His upper lip was white?

38:38.080 --> 38:41.400
You said that he had an intense stare.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.880
And thin, narrow lips.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.000
His upper lip was…

38:53.160 --> 38:55.120
light and flat.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.840
His forehead straight.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.640
Straight? His-- His forehead was straight?

39:07.360 --> 39:08.960
Straight eyebrows.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.760
His face was rectangular.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.400
His chin protruded slightly.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.120
And… And he has a prominent cheek.

39:37.640 --> 39:42.200
Yes, I'm sorry.
Yes, I understand that it's important.

39:42.280 --> 39:46.280
We'll call you back, but I can't say when.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.760
What makes you think he was involved?

39:50.040 --> 39:51.480
Threatening how?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.680
What did the men look like?

39:55.280 --> 39:58.080
Yes. And what's your name?

39:59.680 --> 40:00.960
How do you spell "kvist"?

40:02.520 --> 40:05.240
A woman mentioned an Opel. She's credible.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.600
I'm sure she is,
but I can't handle it right now.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.720
Where should I put this?

40:11.400 --> 40:12.440
Put it there.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.000
Yes.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.920
What time was that?

40:17.960 --> 40:20.120
Bigger investigations are like this.

40:20.200 --> 40:25.480
-Eventually we're going to see a pattern.
-Have you been down to the switchboard?

40:25.560 --> 40:30.000
It's a mountain of information
that just keeps growing.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.320
It's going to
take weeks to find something.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.080
Someone has to raise their gaze.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.680
We're the goddamn brain trust.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.360
We have to trust each other.

40:44.160 --> 40:47.600
-Think freely, ask the right questions.
-Such as?

40:48.200 --> 40:51.600
Who had a motive to kill Palme?
Who had the resources?

40:51.680 --> 40:55.440
-Was it a professional or an amateur?
-A professional, obviously.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.440
Why is that so obvious?

40:57.520 --> 41:02.320
He knew that the bodyguards were off-duty.
He knew that Palme was at the movies.

41:03.640 --> 41:08.400
Several witnesses saw people
with walkie-talkies around Sveavägen.

41:08.480 --> 41:13.560
This was extremely well-planned.
They've been watching Palme for weeks.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.440
-Maybe months.
-They?

41:15.520 --> 41:18.920
Why can't it be a nutjob
who just happened to see Palme?

41:19.000 --> 41:22.760
Just as he happened
to have his Magnum in his pocket?

41:24.240 --> 41:25.280
Exactly.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.320
We're dealing with a group.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.080
What are our options?

41:32.160 --> 41:34.960
Everyone from the Palestinians
to the Germans…

41:35.680 --> 41:38.280
The Red Army Faction,
the Red Brigade…

41:38.360 --> 41:40.200
-The Croats, Ustasha.
-Yes.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.080
The Nazis, South Africa. They hate Palme.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.880
What about the Kurds?

41:47.160 --> 41:48.200
PKK?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.640
Yes, as you can see…

41:56.520 --> 41:59.040
-No.
-No, seriously.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.560
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

42:01.640 --> 42:05.160
Me and my friend
have been waiting for three hours.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.680
I don't know how long it's going to take.
As you can see--

42:08.760 --> 42:11.200
She's seen the murderer.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.520
Someone will take
your statement sooner or later.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.640
Then I can tell you that I am
a journalist from Sveriges Radio.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.560
I'll call someone.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.880
Yes, it's Anette from reception.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.600
Where did you see him?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.000
On Smala Gränd.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.480
It's one of the smaller streets
off David Bagares gata.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.360
That's where he ran, right?

42:37.160 --> 42:40.400
-Do you know what time it was?
-About half past eleven.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.360
So just after the murder.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.880
I came out from Alexandra, the night club.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.760
He ran right past me in total panic.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.240
Can you describe him?

42:51.320 --> 42:54.520
Sure. I can draw him if you like.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.920
I work as an illustrator,
so I could draw him.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.240
Good afternoon, friends.

43:20.320 --> 43:24.360
I understand that
some rumors have been circulating

43:24.440 --> 43:26.440
the last couple of days.

43:26.520 --> 43:31.760
Rumors that we have
a picture of the presumed murderer.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.600
I hereby confirm those rumors.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.960
A young woman, a skilled illustrator,

43:40.040 --> 43:46.400
drew a picture of the running man
she encountered right after the murder.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.200
What the hell is he doing?

43:48.280 --> 43:50.080
…experts from Bundespolizei,

43:50.160 --> 43:53.120
we have produced
a so-called "composite sketch."

43:53.200 --> 43:57.720
We have decided
to release this picture to the newspapers.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.280
We've also received permission

44:00.360 --> 44:05.120
to increase the reward
from 200,000 to 500,000 kronor.

44:05.200 --> 44:11.320
This further intensifies
the hunt for Olof Palme's murderer.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.600
I have a question.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.040
Yes, Arne.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.840
What if the picture is wrong?

44:18.480 --> 44:21.240
The young woman
was very sure of what she saw.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.800
Yes, but what if it isn't the murderer?

44:24.400 --> 44:27.240
Then we'll be looking
for the wrong person.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.160
Or it could be
the breakthrough we're waiting for.

44:48.360 --> 44:50.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.760
Have you seen Expressen?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.320
Sorry? Expressen?

44:56.400 --> 44:58.560
There's a picture of the murderer.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.480
Where-- Where is it?

45:05.560 --> 45:06.920
I put it on the table.

45:21.600 --> 45:26.480
THE POLICE SKETCH OF THE MURDERER

45:39.960 --> 45:43.480
READ HOW THEY CAME UP WITH IT

46:07.240 --> 46:10.000
So, the man Mårten Palme saw--

46:10.080 --> 46:14.720
Who has absolutely no resemblance
to the composite sketch.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.000
That's correct.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.880
-Can you explain that to me?
-Explain what?

46:20.960 --> 46:24.680
Why Holmér and his damn brain trust

46:24.760 --> 46:27.160
would publish
a composite sketch which differs

46:27.240 --> 46:30.040
from all the other descriptions
of the murderer.

46:30.680 --> 46:35.240
Well, Holmér is a visionary.
He stands for a visionary leadership.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.320
The switchboard crashed… again!

46:38.400 --> 46:40.200
Every Swede has seen this--

46:40.280 --> 46:42.240
Stop whining, Lennart.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.720
-Go on.
-Yes.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.640
Thank you.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.960
So, let's see. Yes.

46:49.040 --> 46:53.120
Three other witnesses also
saw this man outside the movie theater.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.360
And he was stressed and upset.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.960
Lisbeth and Palme walked along Sveavägen
until they reached this point.

47:02.200 --> 47:08.160
There they decided to cross Sveavägen
because Lisbeth wanted to look at a dress.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.560
Nothing indicates that they were followed.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.360
Then they continued on
and met the witness Fauzzi,

47:14.440 --> 47:18.040
who says that he saw
somebody walking behind them.

47:18.840 --> 47:24.280
The witness Anders Björkman,
who was drunk and stood here,

47:24.360 --> 47:29.480
says that they were talking to the man
who later on shot Palme.

47:32.200 --> 47:37.000
We have another two witnesses,
the taxi driver Hans and Lars Jeppsson…

47:37.080 --> 47:41.680
They say that the shooter
ran towards Tunnelgatan and up the stairs.

47:42.600 --> 47:48.160
Then we have Yvonne and Ahmed,
who ran into him on David Bagares gata.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.520
They noticed that he had a wrist bag.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.760
What was happening
at the crime scene in the meantime?

47:57.920 --> 47:59.200
Well…

47:59.280 --> 48:03.760
two youngsters,
Anna and Stefan, try to save Palme,

48:03.840 --> 48:07.400
but have to fend off Lisbeth,
who is rather upset, very confused.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.600
The first officer
on the scene was Gösta Söderström.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.240
He couldn't get
any information out of Lisbeth.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.080
A few minutes later,
the SWAT team arrives…

48:20.000 --> 48:22.440
and takes up the hunt
for the perpetrator.

48:22.520 --> 48:26.080
-And these witnesses have been questioned?
-You bet.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.280
We haven't forgotten anyone?

48:33.240 --> 48:34.680
Stig Engström.

48:34.760 --> 48:38.320
-Who's that?
-The guy at… at Skandia.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.720
Right.

48:41.800 --> 48:46.680
He's spoken to several newspapers.
He's very eager and hot for attention.

48:49.320 --> 48:53.360
-What's he saying?
-He keeps changing his story.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.680
At first he said he was just there.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.920
Then he said
that he and Anna helped save Palme.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.520
Then he said
that Lisbeth gave him a description,

49:04.600 --> 49:07.760
after which he ran after the policemen…

49:09.400 --> 49:12.520
and got mixed up with the perp
on the way back.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.280
Is he a compulsive liar?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.840
Was he even at the murder scene?

49:18.440 --> 49:19.280
So he says.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.440
Who questioned him?

49:25.440 --> 49:26.560
That's the thing.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.840
No one's questioned him.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.200
No one?

49:32.400 --> 49:33.800
Not that I can see.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.400
For fuck's sake!

49:41.000 --> 49:43.720
Based on the book The Unlikely Murderer
by Thomas Pettersson.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.480
It has not been proved
that Stig Engström murdered Olof Palme,

49:46.560 --> 49:49.000
but the Swedish police
and Prosecution Authority suspect him.
