00:18.200 --> 00:20.079
Where's Pietro's fishy?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.759
Here it is! Here's the ducky!

00:25.480 --> 00:27.879
- Hi, Dad.
- Take the boy out.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.279
Why?

00:32.080 --> 00:34.359
I told you to take him out.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.799
- I'm bathing him.
- Take him out, hurry up.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.559
Come on, sweetie.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.519
Easy...

01:03.440 --> 01:05.239
Let go of me!

01:06.160 --> 01:07.639
No!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.079
Pietro!

01:14.200 --> 01:16.199
Let go of me!

01:16.640 --> 01:19.239
Don't hurt him!

01:19.360 --> 01:22.519
Why him? Why Pietro, Dad?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.519
'Cause you've already decided
whose side you're on.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.879
My baby, no!

01:31.320 --> 01:33.319
Not my baby!

01:37.160 --> 01:38.959
What's happening?

01:54.040 --> 01:56.839
Our son's in your hands now.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.079
My father...

02:01.240 --> 02:04.319
says you have to speak to his friends.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.639
Gennaro...

02:08.280 --> 02:10.758
If anything happens to him...

02:11.840 --> 02:13.999
I'll never forgive you.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.519
Gennaro, what happened?

03:10.160 --> 03:12.159
Call Patrizia.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.839
Are you Gennaro Savastano's
messenger?

04:17.279 --> 04:18.759
Yes.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.199
Lil' Genny's enjoying doing things
without showing his face.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.559
And why did he pick you?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.879
I was his father's messenger.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.439
Unfortunately, Gennaro Savastano

04:34.560 --> 04:37.639
is not a person of substance
like his father.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.839
He mistook Don Avitabile's
kindness for stupidity.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.359
Gennaro's an arsehole,
who doesn't know how to behave.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.279
- He needs to learn.
- You're teachers now!

04:52.040 --> 04:53.999
Do me a favour.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.839
Tell me what you want in exchange
for the kid.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.199
And let's not waste time.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.799
Let's get it over with.
It's better for him and for you.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.559
The Confederates know everything.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.559
We knew this could happen
and we took it into account.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.839
But who knew that shitbag Avitabile
would give my son to the Confederates!

05:35.960 --> 05:39.679
There's nothing we can do.
We gotta give 'em what they want.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.999
I know, but what they want
isn't something I can control.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.319
What do they want?

05:56.320 --> 06:00.439
That you buy from the Confederates,
through the Capaccios at their price.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.239
In exchange, you give them
40% of your earnings.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.479
You keep Forcella,
but you can't deal outside.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.679
So now we have to be under
the Confederates.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.839
Did anyone tell you to speak?
Then keep quiet.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.279
There's no solution.
Gennaro can't sell to us anymore.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.879
And he can't even go to war
along with us.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.559
Do you realise what you're asking?

06:26.680 --> 06:30.519
Enzo's supposed to shake hands
with Carmela's killer?

06:30.640 --> 06:34.039
Does everyone in here have to talk?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.959
If you don't do what I say,
you'll be alone in this war.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.399
And if you're alone,
this is what happens.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.559
I swear on my life...

07:15.080 --> 07:17.319
we'll get revenge for Carmela.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.159
We got a message from Enzo.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.439
When's he getting discharged?

07:42.560 --> 07:43.799
Tomorrow.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.319
- Can they save his eye?
- They don't know yet.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.239
He sent us here
to tell you something straight off.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.879
He says we gotta stop,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.319
and we gotta go under the Confederates.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.159
Why?

07:59.280 --> 08:01.959
Because that's what Ciro Di Marzio
and Gennaro Savastano want.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.159
That's the shit you gotta eat
when you enter the System.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.519
But we're something else.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.439
I'm not from Forcella.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.759
I was born and raised far from here,

08:20.600 --> 08:23.079
and I'm different from you all.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.279
But you picked me to be your friend,

08:30.360 --> 08:33.159
and what does being friends mean?

08:34.760 --> 08:37.159
Following the same path together.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.159
That's what friends do.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.999
We agreed to walk beside Ciro
Di Marzio and Gennaro Savastano

08:46.120 --> 08:48.319
and today they're asking us to stop.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.959
We're friends with them, so we'll stop.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.319
But starting tomorrow
we go our own way.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.999
And if they don't want to follow us,

09:00.920 --> 09:05.119
it means they're not friends with us.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.799
Let's go.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.359
I love you all.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.839
You guys are on the ball.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.479
You guys put your heart into it.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.319
You're guys who go into battle
and play hard.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.279
But if any of you is still thinking
of fucking us over,

11:29.400 --> 11:32.479
he's barking up the wrong tree.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.999
Opportunity makes the thief.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.879
But to avoid giving you the opportunity,
know what we'll do?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.359
We'll go with you.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.759
That way the instructions
will be clear for everybody.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.999
What do you mean you'll go with us?
That wasn't the deal.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.239
Doesn't he speak nice?
He's studied.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.439
He hasn't studied enough
if he asks questions like that.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.719
So, I'll explain it to him.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.599
How do we know that you'll give us 40%
and you won't screw us?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.159
We'll put our people on your tail.

12:23.280 --> 12:27.119
You collect in front of them.
That way we're all cool,

12:27.240 --> 12:29.719
you and us.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.719
What's the word in Secondigliano,
Lady Annalisa?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.799
It caused a big stink.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.319
Touching someone's kids
is like tearing their heart out.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.879
Wealth, power...

12:52.000 --> 12:54.559
It's all about feelings.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.319
That's why Gennaro Savastano
is on his knees.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.119
Let's drink a toast.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.959
Don Edoardo...

13:16.080 --> 13:20.319
The time's come for a woman
to rule in Secondigliano again.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.519
The Charmer told us
you're holding a wild card.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.919
I need to see it.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.079
Not that I don't trust you,
but you understand...

15:05.200 --> 15:07.719
We need to see all the cards
to play this game.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.479
You're right, Don Ruggero,

15:10.600 --> 15:13.599
we need to go see the cards.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.199
My wild card's here.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.399
Wasn't she
Gennaro Savastano's messenger?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.799
Patrizia is a bright girl,

15:33.920 --> 15:36.719
whereas Gennaro's a halfwit,
and he trusts her.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.959
So?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.439
Gennaro's stopped everything.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.919
He did the right thing.
That was the deal.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.519
With all due respect,

15:52.640 --> 15:55.959
this is a card we need to play well.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.879
What do you mean?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.239
Gennaro Savastano needs
to be patient for a while longer.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.639
We lost a lot of money
because of him.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.559
True. Besides, Gennaro never
gives a shit about agreements.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.999
I think that...

16:17.800 --> 16:22.599
compensation for lost income
is fair enough.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.919
They're not happy
with what you've made up to now.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.119
They want another three million.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.959
I knew it!

16:47.080 --> 16:49.239
Those pieces of shit!

16:51.200 --> 16:54.199
I think you should accept.
It's all you can do.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.799
Obviously I've got to accept.
We're talking about my son!

17:20.160 --> 17:22.799
Now I need you to stay
closer than ever.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.159
Keep your eyes open.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.759
I want to know how he is.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.559
Will you tell me how he is?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.559
Has he eaten?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.479
Did he sleep?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.519
Did he cry last night?

18:46.640 --> 18:49.919
Did you give him
his special blanket to sleep with?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.679
Tell me!

19:13.200 --> 19:15.759
If Pietro doesn't come back...

19:16.720 --> 19:18.719
I'll kill you.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.799
Let's start delivering this.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.399
Let's go.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.559
The Confederates' stuff is shit.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.759
We'll lose our whole market in a week.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.719
We just need to hold on a bit longer.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.959
See you later.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.399
What's wrong, Cantonese?
You don't look too sure.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.919
What if someone notices?
Did you hear Crazy?

20:44.040 --> 20:48.199
Who's gonna notice?
We weren't born to be his slaves.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.159
Bro', we're in a storm

20:51.280 --> 20:54.479
and our captain
is letting the boat drift.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.319
But there's only two of us, you and me.
Where do we start?

20:58.400 --> 21:00.399
If you've changed your mind, go home.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.399
I haven't changed my mind.
I'm with you. Let's go.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.039
- Can we trust him?
- The doctor's the best courier.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.599
He's riddled with debt
and he's scared of us. He won't talk.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.799
And he's got fuck-all to do
with what goes on here, don't worry.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.719
Hi there, all good?

21:27.840 --> 21:29.319
All good.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.239
You'll get a new shipment.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.119
Take care, Doc.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.799
Goodbye.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.440
Azzurra?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.159
Gennaro...

22:04.280 --> 22:07.039
What's happening?
Why isn't Pietro back?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.239
I'm doing everything they tell me to.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.279
I know what a father
who plays with his son's life is like.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.039
I know and I'll never forget it.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.079
Bring back my son.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.639
- Hi, Mum, all good?
- Yeah, you?

24:08.520 --> 24:10.319
Go play in there.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.159
All done?

24:53.280 --> 24:56.279
We gotta push it right now.
It's just you and me.

25:20.080 --> 25:24.079
Careful, it's all the money
I've made since I came back.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.279
Don't worry.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.959
They fucked up.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.519
- They didn't keep up their end, huh?
- No.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.239
It went like you said.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.759
Those fucking beards...

26:57.680 --> 27:00.279
I counted it, it's all there.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.479
Well done, Gennaro.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.639
There's a problem though. Right?

27:52.040 --> 27:54.199
What problem is that?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.479
Gennaro's guys didn't stick to the deal.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.279
The kid's not coming back for now.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.199
Tell them to leave.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.999
Leave the room, please.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.479
Where are the other two?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.399
You can talk to me.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.559
You speak for them?

29:03.680 --> 29:05.679
Here I am.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.879
Then I'll kill you first.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.959
The Confederates want
someone to be made an example of

29:17.080 --> 29:18.719
and we gotta do it,

29:18.840 --> 29:22.399
or they'll throw my son
into a meat grinder.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.839
I know you're mad, I would be too.

29:27.720 --> 29:32.359
Ronni and Cantonese made a big
mistake and I apologise for them.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.759
But in this war...

29:41.760 --> 29:43.879
I'm the first to lose flesh and blood.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.599
I can't support you
because they're brothers,

29:49.720 --> 29:53.759
and if I allow you to go ahead,
two rebels will become a hundred.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.679
That's what the Confederates want,

29:57.400 --> 29:59.959
for you to turn on each other.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.799
For you to spit in your friends' faces.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.479
Well, if that's what they want,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.279
that's what we'll give them.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.559
Enough!

31:19.360 --> 31:21.679
You good with that?

31:53.480 --> 31:56.959
Tell the Wizard that my son
needs to go back to his mother.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.759
They killed me for real.

33:16.720 --> 33:20.359
Fuck up again
and you'll have me to answer to.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.759
Hurry up.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.639
The kid won't be touched.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.919
What are you saying, Don Ruggero?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.839
What's right.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.919
Gennaro did what he was supposed to.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.199
The kid can go home.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.439
Don Edoardo says if we keep going,
we'll knock him out for good.

35:15.080 --> 35:21.839
The Charmer's grown tight with Crazy
and the Graduate, and I let him.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.559
For a moment,
I forgot that the Wizard

35:24.680 --> 35:27.679
has always kept his word.

35:28.440 --> 35:32.679
And it's gotta go back
to being like that, now and forever!

36:07.320 --> 36:08.799
Wait.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.359
Oh, my God!

36:21.480 --> 36:23.839
Pietro! Sweetheart!

36:23.960 --> 36:26.439
Hello, my darling!

36:26.560 --> 36:28.479
Hello, Mummy's sweetheart.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.119
My life! Sweetheart!

36:31.240 --> 36:34.039
Hello, my darling.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.919
It won't be long, Mummy's boy.

36:55.040 --> 36:59.439
We're going away. It won't be long.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.559
Are you happy?

38:00.040 --> 38:03.479
- Lady Annalisa.
- Patrizia! It's you!

38:03.600 --> 38:06.999
I've been expecting you.
We need to drink a toast.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.359
Hold on.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.479
Come here.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.119
You did a great job.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.039
You got him to where we need him.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.959
How did you do it?

38:25.080 --> 38:26.639
How did you manage

38:26.760 --> 38:30.239
to take in Gennaro so easily?

38:30.360 --> 38:32.839
I simply told him the truth.

38:50.280 --> 38:54.599
Now the good part's coming.
We end him the way he deserves.

38:54.720 --> 38:58.319
But now you need to be careful, Patrizia.

39:03.520 --> 39:07.519
You gotta play the part
'til the very end.

39:08.040 --> 39:12.679
Gennaro's trust in you
needs to be stoked like a fire

39:12.800 --> 39:14.679
until the moment arrives.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.479
Don't worry, Lady Annalisa,
I know how to wait.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.199
I know.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.959
I know perfectly well.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.239
That's why you need to stay by my side.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.879
Patrizia...

39:40.840 --> 39:42.559
Have you got a boyfriend?

39:44.600 --> 39:46.079
No.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.119
That's how it should be.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.799
You're not cut out
to be somebody's woman.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.919
You need to stay with me forever.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.959
To the new queen of Secondigliano!

40:17.760 --> 40:19.559
Cheers.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.079
COMING UP
