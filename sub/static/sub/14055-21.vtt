WEBVTT

00:00.954 --> 00:02.834
Previously on The O.C.:

00:03.154 --> 00:04.834
How many wines have we tasted?

00:04.834 --> 00:05.874
I stopped taking notes.

00:05.874 --> 00:07.314
A little too much Indian spirit, huh?

00:07.314 --> 00:09.074
Well, drive back in the morning.

00:09.074 --> 00:10.194
I need to go home.

00:10.194 --> 00:11.914
The Nana's not nice.
I love her, but she's not.

00:11.914 --> 00:12.754
It's kind of part of her charm.

00:12.754 --> 00:14.914
I hate this state!
I hate the sunshine!

00:14.914 --> 00:18.034
I hate the ocean!
I hate Schwarzenegger!

00:21.754 --> 00:22.794
I don't believe it, Ryan.

00:22.794 --> 00:24.754
Bright Eyes has two albums in the top ten.

00:24.754 --> 00:25.674
Are you okay with that?

00:25.674 --> 00:28.714
Yeah, I just feel like the rest of the world has finally caught up to me.

00:28.714 --> 00:31.594
- It's a little bit scary.
- Yeah, it's a lot scary.

00:31.594 --> 00:33.194
Tell me I'm still special.

00:37.394 --> 00:38.354
Sethela.

00:38.354 --> 00:40.354
Nanala.
How you feeling?

00:40.354 --> 00:43.194
Oh, if you were all that interested, you would have called me.

00:43.194 --> 00:46.114
And would it kill you to cash that birthday check I sent you?

00:46.114 --> 00:49.554
- I'm finished sending you things.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I forgot.

00:49.554 --> 00:50.954
You make my life very difficult.

00:50.954 --> 00:54.434
No, I'm sure that $20 outstanding has the bank just going crazy.

00:54.434 --> 00:56.314
Yeah, smart ass.
Where's your father?

00:56.314 --> 00:57.594
- I don't know...
- Who is it, Seth?

00:57.594 --> 01:00.514
Actually, my mom just came in if you want to talk to her.

01:00.514 --> 01:02.114
- It's The Nana.
- No.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.394
What do you want me..?

01:03.394 --> 01:05.674
Hello, my dad just showed up.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.114
Awkward family moment avoided for everyone but me.

01:08.114 --> 01:09.994
- Love you.
- Yeah? You coulïve fooled me.

01:09.994 --> 01:11.234
It's The Nana.

01:11.594 --> 01:15.234
Oh. Ma!
Hey! How are you?

01:15.714 --> 01:17.674
Why does he always get so much louder when he talks to her?

01:17.674 --> 01:18.914
They're a family of screamers.

01:18.914 --> 01:20.994
- How's your grandma feeling?
- The Nana. Ryan, please.

01:20.994 --> 01:24.154
"Grandma" invokes homemade cookies and maybe someonewho's actually nice to you.

01:24.154 --> 01:26.514
The Nana, definitely not nice to you, or me.

01:26.514 --> 01:28.394
- But she's doing great.
- Full remission.

01:28.394 --> 01:31.874
Which confirms my suspicion that she is, in fact, immortal.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.554
What? So soon?

01:33.554 --> 01:34.954
Oh, my God, Ma.

01:35.914 --> 01:37.554
Let me call you back.

01:38.034 --> 01:40.434
- What happened?
- Is everything all right?

01:41.714 --> 01:44.714
The Nana...headed for the altar.

01:44.714 --> 01:46.234
She's getting married?

01:46.234 --> 01:48.114
Pack your bags.
We're going to Miami.

01:48.354 --> 01:49.154
All right.

01:49.274 --> 01:51.274
Shuffleboard, mahjongg, dinner at 4:00.

01:51.634 --> 01:53.194
This is gonna be the best spring break ever.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.141
Hey, mon.

02:25.141 --> 02:27.701
Now, I know you think you're excited about Miami,

02:27.701 --> 02:30.981
but I cannot wait for you to meet the guys at Nana's condo.

02:30.981 --> 02:34.381
We got Abe, we got Stu, we got Stanley.

02:34.381 --> 02:36.341
Although I think Stanley may have passed on.

02:36.341 --> 02:38.981
- He had a prostate thing. I hope not...
- I can't go.

02:38.981 --> 02:40.501
What? Why not?

02:40.501 --> 02:41.861
'Cause, you know, everything with me and Marissa.

02:41.861 --> 02:42.821
Is awesome.

02:42.821 --> 02:44.501
Fine, okay, but, you know, there's Trey.

02:44.501 --> 02:46.021
Who's also doing awesome.

02:46.021 --> 02:48.581
Ryan, face it, you've got no excuses.

02:48.581 --> 02:50.741
Everything's great.
You deserve a vacation.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.941
We, actually, deserve a vacation, Ryan.

02:52.941 --> 02:54.421
And it would mean a lot to my dad.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.421
Yeah, yeah, he is kind of worked up.

02:56.421 --> 02:58.381
- He's gonna need some company.
- Well, he's got you.

02:58.381 --> 03:00.381
I can't, man.
My schedule's all booked up.

03:00.381 --> 03:04.261
I got pinochle with the ladies on Saturday, bridge Sunday with the fellas.

03:04.261 --> 03:06.381
I still got to call and see if I can get on that bingo cruise.

03:06.381 --> 03:08.541
That's gonna be freaking awesome.
What about you and Summer?

03:08.541 --> 03:12.221
I'm going to go over there, I'm going to apologize extremely sincerely,

03:12.221 --> 03:15.421
and then I'm gonna get out of town before I can do anything else wrong.

03:15.421 --> 03:19.301
- What do you say?
- Miami. Miami.

03:28.061 --> 03:28.981
Honey?

03:29.301 --> 03:30.661
Do you have my American Advantage number?

03:30.661 --> 03:33.661
I'm on AA.com and I'm trying to use my miles to upgrade.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.821
You know me, I hate sitting in the middle.

03:35.821 --> 03:38.181
It's in my purse.
But what's the rush, sweetie?

03:38.181 --> 03:40.141
It's not like she's getting married tomorrow.

03:40.141 --> 03:43.101
I know, it's just...
I love my mother.

03:43.301 --> 03:45.381
- But who else would?
- That's terrible.

03:45.381 --> 03:47.301
You wouldn't say the same thing about your dad?

03:47.301 --> 03:48.301
You make a good point.

03:48.301 --> 03:50.061
You know, she was just so happy on the phone.

03:50.061 --> 03:52.301
I just want to make sure everything works out for her.

03:52.301 --> 03:55.701
Great. Especially after the year she's had.

03:56.261 --> 03:59.661
- You are a good son.
- Oh, yeah?

03:59.661 --> 04:03.781
- How about husband?
- Definitely top five.

04:05.421 --> 04:08.101
Miami, huh?
Well, have a hell of a time, man.

04:08.101 --> 04:10.261
- Thanks, you'll be all right?
- Don't worry, Mom.

04:10.261 --> 04:11.741
I'll be fine.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.461
Uh, yo, Ry, look, I got to jump.

04:16.461 --> 04:19.541
Probably the landlord complaining about something.

04:21.581 --> 04:23.861
Have fun.
See ya.

04:28.661 --> 04:30.181
Definitely not the landlord.

04:30.501 --> 04:31.901
Hey, you.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.541
So...

04:36.221 --> 04:40.141
I just wanted to come by to say thanks again for not selling me out.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.301
Have you met Don Julio?

04:42.821 --> 04:46.461
Yeah, me and Don go way back.

04:46.461 --> 04:49.021
- Thanks for the gift.
- Oh, that's not the gift.

04:49.461 --> 04:55.501
I figure, a guy's been in prison for 18 months, probably got pretty lonely.

05:00.421 --> 05:02.301
You have no idea.

05:10.581 --> 05:12.261
Hey, Summer.
Busy?

05:12.781 --> 05:14.941
- What do you want, Cohen?
- To...talk.

05:18.141 --> 05:21.181
- Hold my bag.
- Anything for my Million Dollar Baby.

05:22.101 --> 05:23.301
Um...so look...

05:23.301 --> 05:25.301
- I just came to apologize.
- Why?

05:25.301 --> 05:28.301
'Cause I was humiliated in front of all your oh- so- hip,

05:28.301 --> 05:31.061
super- dorked- out, indie- music- loving, comic- book geeks

05:31.061 --> 05:34.621
who looked at me like I was some dimwit Orange County ho?

05:36.061 --> 05:37.861
But that was never my intention. Okay?

05:37.861 --> 05:40.981
I really only wanted you there to be a part of everything with me.

05:40.981 --> 05:44.541
Look, there's no point in your apologizing because you can no longer make me upset.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.381
You're just immune to my charms?

05:46.381 --> 05:47.621
Working on it.

05:47.701 --> 05:49.381
But you know what I could use?

05:49.701 --> 05:51.221
A time- out.

05:54.701 --> 05:58.301
Well, you know, good.
That, actually, 'cause...

05:58.301 --> 06:02.101
that's good timing, 'cause I'm headed to Miami to see The Nana, so...

06:02.101 --> 06:03.501
Well, perfect.

06:03.501 --> 06:06.541
Yeah, go to Miami, get wasted and wind up on Music Video

06:06.541 --> 06:08.781
- Nation's Spring Break Special.
- It's actually nothing like that.

06:08.781 --> 06:10.581
The only thing I'm going to be drinking is Metamucil.

06:10.581 --> 06:12.701
Oh, yeah. Like I'm going to believe that.

06:12.701 --> 06:14.981
Just go.
Go sow your oats.

06:14.981 --> 06:18.541
Get all of your Coheny, Cohenish Cohenisms out of your system.

06:18.541 --> 06:19.821
And when I get back?

06:20.741 --> 06:22.261
We'll see.

06:35.181 --> 06:40.901
So just imagine, a whole weekend of nothing but this.

06:41.861 --> 06:44.261
If you could just hold that thought till, like, next weekend.

06:44.261 --> 06:49.061
- Why, are you going somewhere?
- Uh...yeah, actually, Miami.

06:50.781 --> 06:52.861
South Beach for a little spring break action?

06:52.861 --> 06:53.981
Meet some college girls?

06:53.981 --> 06:56.421
Not quite. I'm going with Seth and Sandy to see The Nana.

06:56.421 --> 06:59.301
Oh, that's really sweet.
That'll be fun.

06:59.301 --> 07:01.141
Yeah, no, it will be.
It's just, I don't know.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.501
I feel kind of weird leaving Trey here by himself.

07:03.821 --> 07:06.301
- I can hang out with him.
- Yeah, really?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.941
Because I was kind of gonna help him find a job.

07:09.941 --> 07:12.141
- I got it covered.
- Thanks, I owe you.

07:12.581 --> 07:15.581
Mm, yes. You do.
You do owe me.

07:15.581 --> 07:19.381
A whole weekend of nothing but this.

07:24.781 --> 07:25.901
That, I can do.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.061
All right, now, you've got all the numbers?

07:28.061 --> 07:30.221
My cell phone? The Fontainebleau? The Nana?

07:30.221 --> 07:31.621
I got the numbers.

07:32.541 --> 07:35.021
You remember how to set the alarm to no delay?

07:35.021 --> 07:36.821
And if the alarm goes off, the code word is..?

07:36.821 --> 07:38.621
"Greased Lightning."
I got it.

07:38.621 --> 07:39.941
Yes. Do you need any cash?

07:39.941 --> 07:41.821
- I have plenty of money.
- I gassed up your car.

07:41.821 --> 07:43.901
- Which I so appreciate.
- Are you going to be fine?

07:43.901 --> 07:47.101
- I'll be fine.
- I love you.

07:48.141 --> 07:50.541
The question is, are you going to be okay?

07:54.381 --> 07:56.141
Fellas, you got everything?

07:56.141 --> 07:58.861
I got my cardigan, my orthopedic shoes and my humidifier.

07:58.861 --> 08:01.141
Now take me to my people.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.501
Is Carter in the office?

08:48.781 --> 08:50.581
In the immortal words of Will Smith--

08:50.861 --> 08:53.541
- Thank you--
- "Welcome to Miami."

08:53.541 --> 08:56.541
There's too many young, tan, healthy people here. I don't like it.

08:56.541 --> 08:58.861
Let's check in anyway.
Hey, who wants some dinner?

08:58.861 --> 09:01.381
Yeah, it is 4:00 p. m. in Orange County.

09:01.381 --> 09:03.261
They put us on the early bird circuit.

09:07.941 --> 09:09.701
I have the weekend to myself.

09:10.181 --> 09:12.861
I thought we could roll up our sleeves, really dig in,

09:12.861 --> 09:14.941
and maybe even get a few issues ahead.

09:14.941 --> 09:17.541
Well, I'd hold onto that thought if I were you.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.221
Turns out, Newport Living,

09:19.221 --> 09:22.301
which I thought would be the last nail in the coffin that is my career,

09:22.301 --> 09:25.101
is actually the thing that saved it.

09:27.061 --> 09:29.461
You got another job offer?

09:29.781 --> 09:33.301
- Well, Carter, that's great.
- Thanks.

09:35.221 --> 09:37.461
Yeah, so I fly out on Monday.

09:37.701 --> 09:40.141
- Fly out where?
- New York.

09:40.141 --> 09:42.981
That's where the job is and they're relocating me.

09:43.301 --> 09:44.821
You're leaving?

09:45.141 --> 09:46.301
I am.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.861
But my publisher is lining up someone to replace me.

09:50.861 --> 09:54.501
You know, someone who is smarter, and better at this than I am.

09:54.501 --> 09:55.941
So...

09:57.581 --> 10:01.301
I hope you don't think I'm jumping ship.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.701
Because you are.

10:05.541 --> 10:08.181
It's really great.

10:18.941 --> 10:21.861
I was thinking we could have a farewell dinner.

10:22.661 --> 10:23.941
You know what?
We should.

10:23.941 --> 10:26.181
Great. I'll make a reservation at Arches.

10:26.181 --> 10:29.381
Or you could come by the house tomorrow.

10:29.381 --> 10:30.461
I'll cook.

10:36.301 --> 10:37.941
Man! I thought Newport was nice.

10:37.941 --> 10:38.821
This is something, huh?

10:38.821 --> 10:41.581
Yeah, if you're a fan of that vibrant night life.

10:41.581 --> 10:43.381
Hey, why can't we go see The Nana tonight?

10:43.381 --> 10:45.021
You know The Nana and her schedule.

10:45.021 --> 10:46.381
Friday night's mahjongg.

10:46.381 --> 10:47.461
- What?
- Yeah.

10:47.461 --> 10:48.701
Since when is Friday night mahjongg?

10:48.701 --> 10:50.461
It totally throws off my schedule.

10:50.461 --> 10:51.741
Breathe it in, boys.

10:51.741 --> 10:54.661
We've got a weekend away with nothing to worry about.

11:03.821 --> 11:06.181
- Sorry.
- Marissa. What's up?

11:06.181 --> 11:07.981
Ryan took off for Miami, huh?

11:07.981 --> 11:12.261
Yeah, so I just wanted you to know that while he's gone, I'm here.

11:13.181 --> 11:14.101
Cool.

11:14.461 --> 11:17.621
Uh...you know, you don't have to, if you don't want to.

11:17.621 --> 11:19.101
No, I want to.

11:19.101 --> 11:22.261
And you know, I thought maybe tomorrow we could go job hunting.

11:22.261 --> 11:24.221
That sounds great.

11:25.021 --> 11:27.421
I thought with Ryan gone, I was going to be all alone in Newport.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.021
No, not on my watch.

11:29.341 --> 11:31.581
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Can't wait.

11:49.101 --> 11:52.301
You and Marissa Cooper?
Yeah, right.

11:55.541 --> 11:57.861
- It's not like that.
- Sure isn't.

11:57.861 --> 12:01.701
Not in this lifetime, or in this town.

12:21.037 --> 12:23.117
- Adios...
- Your move!

12:23.117 --> 12:26.037
- Huh? You're playing with him?
- Yeah, I'm playing with him.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.837
- I thought you were playing with me.
- I'm playing with him.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.797
No, I- I just...I just moved.

12:29.797 --> 12:31.157
Now we're talking.

12:31.157 --> 12:32.797
- You're playing with him?
- All right, so I'll watch.

12:32.797 --> 12:36.597
- Abe, Stu, Stanley.
- Hey, look who's here.

12:36.597 --> 12:38.557
- How are you?
- Terrible.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.037
- Worse. Worse.
- How's your nervous stomach?

12:41.037 --> 12:44.037
- You still got schpilkis?
- Why don't you have a seat?

12:44.477 --> 12:46.277
You need my heating pad?

12:46.277 --> 12:48.757
Back's a little sore.
Back's a little sore.

12:48.757 --> 12:51.397
All right, now I'm officially terrified.

12:51.397 --> 12:53.597
He doesn't have this many friends at school.

12:53.597 --> 12:56.557
So they do fly airplanes from Orange County to Miami.

12:56.557 --> 12:58.757
I wouldn't know.
I see so little of you.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.117
Ma!

13:02.117 --> 13:05.557
- You look better than ever.
- Yeah? I'm getting married.

13:05.957 --> 13:06.837
You remember Ryan.

13:06.837 --> 13:09.317
Of course. Who would forget, with those arms?

13:10.397 --> 13:13.437
You know, if I weren't engaged...ooh...

13:13.957 --> 13:15.957
Ah, there's my grandson.

13:16.197 --> 13:18.677
- Hello, bubeleh.
- Hello, Nana.

13:20.077 --> 13:24.557
I want you to tell me everything that's gone on for you this whole last year.

13:24.557 --> 13:28.677
Oh...I can barely remember what I had for dinner last night.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.877
- Please!
- Welcome to the club, yeah.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.237
- Me, too.
- You know.

13:33.517 --> 13:35.557
- You want to talk?
- Sure, I do.

13:35.957 --> 13:39.037
You keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't die of old age, huh?

13:42.557 --> 13:45.877
Is this...some Mueslix Malted?

13:46.237 --> 13:47.997
Kirsten couldn't make it?

13:48.357 --> 13:50.317
Well...she wanted to.

13:52.277 --> 13:54.517
So how are things with you two?

13:55.037 --> 13:56.317
To be honest?

13:56.717 --> 13:58.157
They've been better.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.437
You two will work it out.

14:04.317 --> 14:06.317
Since when did you become such a romantic?

14:06.317 --> 14:08.397
Falling in love will do that to you.

14:08.397 --> 14:09.317
Speaking of which,

14:09.317 --> 14:15.277
I have photos from the place where we're holding the ceremony in June.

14:15.277 --> 14:17.357
So you should book your tickets now.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.277
Whoa, June? What's the rush?

14:19.277 --> 14:21.397
- Pregnant?
- Eh...very funny.

14:21.397 --> 14:25.397
Listen, you go through a year like I did, you don't want to waste any time.

14:25.397 --> 14:29.117
Besides...I want to move before the summer storms hit.

14:29.117 --> 14:30.637
- You're moving?
- Yeah.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.237
Bobby is 12 years my junior.

14:32.237 --> 14:34.357
This place skews a little old for him.

14:34.357 --> 14:37.157
We're going to move to the condo you bought me in Sarasota.

14:37.157 --> 14:38.797
Well, finally.
It was meant to be lived in.

14:38.797 --> 14:40.197
Bobby flipped when he saw it.

14:40.197 --> 14:42.717
Beach front, unbeatable location, why wouldn't he?

14:44.157 --> 14:45.997
I know what you're thinking, Sanford.

14:46.357 --> 14:48.917
And cynicism is a Cohen family trait.

14:48.917 --> 14:50.677
Yeah, well, I learned from the master.

14:50.677 --> 14:54.357
Yeah, well...nonetheless, he's a good guy.

14:54.357 --> 14:56.157
And he can move his practice anywhere.

14:56.157 --> 14:58.997
Everybody always needs a good chiropractor.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.477
Not another word.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.357
- I can't wait to meet him.
- Very good.

15:07.357 --> 15:09.797
- Eat your lunch.
- Yes, Ma.

15:16.997 --> 15:18.997
Hey, Summer?

15:21.717 --> 15:22.997
Oh, God.

15:22.997 --> 15:25.157
Zach, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

15:25.157 --> 15:26.277
I was in a rage blackout.

15:26.277 --> 15:28.517
My therapist told me that boxing might help me work through it.

15:28.517 --> 15:31.277
I came over to see if, uh, you were okay after the other night.

15:31.277 --> 15:34.917
I'm in gym clothes, and my hair is in French braids, so I'm terrible.

15:35.317 --> 15:38.037
Cohen and I are on a time- out.

15:38.877 --> 15:41.997
He went off to Miami, to, I'm sure, party it up like he always does

15:41.997 --> 15:43.717
this time of year when we're on a time- out.

15:43.717 --> 15:45.797
Well, are you too full of rage to hang out?

15:45.797 --> 15:47.037
Maybe come over for dinner?

15:47.037 --> 15:49.877
No offense, Zach, but hanging with your family couldn't sound worse.

15:49.877 --> 15:52.157
Oh, no. I totally understand.

15:52.157 --> 15:56.397
Um...they're in Aspen for an economics conference.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.157
Come on, I'll cook.
Italian.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.717
Francesca gave me a great recipe.

16:06.037 --> 16:08.197
Choke!
Sit down.

16:09.477 --> 16:11.717
Sorry, it's a figure of speech.
Victory lap.

16:16.837 --> 16:18.397
You cleaned his clock.

16:18.397 --> 16:21.197
Not that he'll pay up, that cheap bastard.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.677
All right, listen up.
What do you say?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.597
Uh, are you ready to roll?
'Cause I'm really hungry.

16:24.597 --> 16:26.677
Hey, I'm famished, too.

16:26.677 --> 16:29.077
It doesn't seem like there's anybody left to beat,

16:29.077 --> 16:30.837
so why don't we go into the dining hall?

16:30.837 --> 16:33.557
We're going to have lunch, my treat.

16:34.597 --> 16:37.157
- Can't beat that.
- Can I get in on the action?

16:39.117 --> 16:41.917
Mary Sue.
Nice to meet you.

16:42.197 --> 16:44.157
This is my grandma, Mary Ellen.

16:45.997 --> 16:47.997
Uh, actually we were going to go eat.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.677
- Right?
- Yeah, well, you like food?

16:50.997 --> 16:52.397
One round?

16:53.517 --> 16:54.557
Sure.

16:55.117 --> 16:57.517
Sure...
It'll just take a second. Okay!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.157
Rack them, sir.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.567
Hey, how'd it go?

17:10.567 --> 17:11.847
My dream's come true.

17:12.127 --> 17:14.047
- I'm cleaning toilets.
- You got it?

17:14.047 --> 17:16.847
- I start tomorrow.
- Oh, that's great!

17:20.047 --> 17:23.087
Uh, so, we, uh...we got to celebrate, tonight, okay?

17:23.087 --> 17:24.727
I will make margaritas.

17:24.727 --> 17:26.686
Um...I'll bring the guacamole.

17:26.686 --> 17:28.727
Sounds like a party.

17:29.087 --> 17:31.887
But, uh, I've got to stay here, fill out some paperwork, so...

17:32.327 --> 17:36.247
I'll see you tonight, uh...
And hey, thanks.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.807
I feel like my life's coming together.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.327
Hey, I'm happy to help.

17:40.607 --> 17:42.287
So, uh, I'll see you later.

17:57.407 --> 17:59.887
I do believe we have a new shuffleboard champion.

18:02.847 --> 18:05.367
- I can't believe she beat me.
- I can. Can we eat now?

18:05.367 --> 18:07.327
Absolutely not.
I won't go down like that.

18:07.327 --> 18:10.127
Look, these people look up to me.
I'm like a god to them.

18:10.607 --> 18:12.687
Do you, uh...want to lose again?

18:12.687 --> 18:13.847
I want to play again.

18:13.847 --> 18:15.687
Only this time, why don't we make it interesting?

18:15.687 --> 18:16.807
A little wager.

18:16.807 --> 18:18.807
You want to do money, you want to do food?

18:19.167 --> 18:21.527
You want me to streak naked through the bingo hall?

18:21.927 --> 18:23.447
Actually, uh...

18:25.847 --> 18:28.407
- I do need a partner.
- A partner?

18:28.807 --> 18:30.287
Uh, what kind of partner?

18:30.287 --> 18:33.767
Well, see, besides being down here to visit my grandma,

18:34.007 --> 18:36.287
I entered into a dance contest.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.007
Dance contest?

18:38.007 --> 18:42.367
For Music Video Nation, for their Big Spring Break Special.

18:42.367 --> 18:47.567
And the winner gets $5, 000, which...would really help with my college loans.

18:49.407 --> 18:51.487
That sounds very reasonable, Mary Sue.

18:53.607 --> 18:56.567
The only move she's getting out of me is a victory dance.

18:59.527 --> 19:01.447
What up, what up, what up?

19:03.127 --> 19:09.087
My name's Swerve, the host of MVN Sp- Sp- Spring Break.

19:09.087 --> 19:13.047
Coming at you live from South Beach.

19:13.887 --> 19:18.647
Hi, I'm Pixie, one of the stars of Sherman Oaks, the Real Valley.

19:19.927 --> 19:20.887
All right, all right.

19:20.887 --> 19:23.047
I hope y'all are pumped up, because this next performance

19:23.047 --> 19:27.407
is gonna be off the chain and totally bananz- oh- bananz- oh- bananas!

19:27.407 --> 19:32.407
Bring 'em out for my dawg, from the dirty South, T. I!

19:32.407 --> 19:35.127
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out

19:35.127 --> 19:38.647
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in ya mouth
Come on, swizzie!

19:38.967 --> 19:42.207
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
Aye, aye, check 'em out, bring 'em out

19:42.207 --> 19:46.207
TIP comin' live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life

19:46.207 --> 19:48.207
When I leave both the Feds and the State

19:48.207 --> 19:50.327
Wanna see my need, the whole city got berserk

19:50.327 --> 19:53.847
He got treat, another rapper got a hit but surely he not me

19:53.847 --> 19:56.327
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed?

19:56.327 --> 19:59.087
Da King back now, y'alls
Don't even know how to act now

19:59.087 --> 20:01.287
Hit the club strippers gettin' naked 'fore I sat down

20:01.287 --> 20:02.647
Still ballin' money, stack taller than Shaq now

20:02.647 --> 20:05.007
I don't know, man. I never played anyone under 85 before.

20:05.007 --> 20:05.767
All right.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.527
Um, I think the registration tent is over there.

20:07.527 --> 20:08.847
We need to sign in.

20:08.847 --> 20:10.967
So what kind of dancing are we talking about here?

20:10.967 --> 20:13.127
A little jazz step, a little soft shoe?

20:13.127 --> 20:15.327
Actually it's not quite a dance contest.

20:15.327 --> 20:16.687
It isn't?

20:18.847 --> 20:20.847
- She's got whipped cream, Seth.
- Yeah, I know.

20:20.847 --> 20:22.127
Maybe she's baking a cake.

20:22.127 --> 20:24.527
See, I'm going to cover myself in whipped cream,

20:24.527 --> 20:26.527
and you're going to lick it all off and eat a cherry

20:26.527 --> 20:29.247
out of my mouth before any of the other contestants.

20:29.367 --> 20:30.487
Did she say "cherry"?

20:30.487 --> 20:33.207
If we win, it would mean so much to my grandma.

20:33.207 --> 20:35.607
Not having to worry about my college loans.

20:35.967 --> 20:38.447
With all the money she spends on medication...

20:40.087 --> 20:42.567
It's...her grandma.

20:42.807 --> 20:44.207
What does she have?

20:44.247 --> 20:45.847
Yeah, well, just hope...

20:45.847 --> 20:47.687
Summer hasn't paid her cable bill.

20:47.687 --> 20:50.087
I got a packed house yellin', bring 'em out, bring 'em out

20:50.087 --> 20:52.447
Aye, all my hot girls yellin' bring 'em out, bring 'em out

20:52.447 --> 20:54.767
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin' bring 'em out, bring 'em out

20:54.767 --> 20:57.727
From the back they yellin bring 'em out, bring 'em out!

21:05.844 --> 21:07.404
Hey, what's going on?

21:07.404 --> 21:10.004
Uh, it's, um, actually kind of a long story.

21:10.004 --> 21:11.284
Can you do me a favor?

21:11.284 --> 21:15.124
If you see Summer, would you, um, keep her away from the television?

21:15.124 --> 21:18.484
Well, actually, I was going over to Trey's to celebrate.

21:18.484 --> 21:21.724
- He got a job.
- Really? That's awesome.

21:22.084 --> 21:27.564
They disqualified me from the wet T- shirt contest, but don't they look real?

21:29.564 --> 21:31.684
Wait, that wasn't The Nana, was it?

21:31.684 --> 21:33.364
Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke.

21:35.844 --> 21:40.204
Actually, I'm, uh...kind of wishing I was back home right now.

21:40.204 --> 21:42.724
Yeah, I'm kind of wishing that, too.

21:44.884 --> 21:47.004
Stay out of trouble, okay?

21:47.004 --> 21:48.044
I got you.

21:52.124 --> 21:54.004
Wow, it's like a regular Olive Garden around here.

21:54.004 --> 21:56.204
Buon giorno, Summer.

21:56.364 --> 21:58.924
So, what is...

21:58.924 --> 22:00.204
gah- nochi?

22:00.204 --> 22:02.924
I don't know, I'm making gnocchi.

22:03.444 --> 22:04.844
You never had gnocchi before?

22:04.844 --> 22:07.604
No, I've never heard of it until, like, five seconds ago.

22:07.604 --> 22:09.684
- How do you say it?
- Gnocchi.

22:10.124 --> 22:12.844
- Gnocchi.
- Bellissimo.

22:13.804 --> 22:17.204
Listen, I'm going to be a while, so I'm going to turn on the TV here.

22:18.164 --> 22:21.084
Ah, MVN Spring Break Special.

22:21.084 --> 22:22.484
Perfecto.

22:23.444 --> 22:26.004
I took the Italian thing a little too far there, didn't I?

22:26.364 --> 22:28.004
You had me at buon giorno.

22:28.684 --> 22:30.204
Thanks for having me over.

22:30.564 --> 22:32.444
And don't worry, I won't talk about Cohen.

22:32.444 --> 22:35.364
Oh, Cohen or no Cohen, I'm just here for the gnocchi.

22:39.444 --> 22:41.124
I really want you to like him, Sandy.

22:41.124 --> 22:43.044
Oh, me, too.
Welcome.

22:43.364 --> 22:45.444
- Me, too.
- There he is.

22:46.044 --> 22:49.164
- Hey, Sandy Cohen. Pleasure.
- Bobby Mills.

22:49.164 --> 22:51.644
Heard a lot about you.
Hey, sweetie.

22:52.724 --> 22:54.084
It's unbelievable.

22:54.084 --> 22:56.804
You look way too young to have a son this old.

22:56.804 --> 22:59.844
- Hey, no offense.
- Why would I be offended?

23:01.564 --> 23:05.324
I have to tinkle, so you two have a lot to talk about.

23:05.404 --> 23:07.244
Mainly, me.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.604
She's a great lady, huh? Your mom.

23:12.604 --> 23:14.004
What a pistol.

23:14.004 --> 23:16.564
I always thought it was more of an AK- 47.

23:17.484 --> 23:20.084
I got to tell you, Bobby, since she's met you, she has mellowed.

23:20.084 --> 23:22.204
My mother in love--
I never thought I'd see the day.

23:22.204 --> 23:26.684
She came into my clinic, I cracked her back, and the rest is history.

23:26.684 --> 23:29.124
Wow. That is so romantic.

23:29.124 --> 23:32.284
I'm just so happy she's met a nice guy, you know?

23:32.284 --> 23:35.404
- An honest guy.
- Oh, thank you, Sandy.

23:35.404 --> 23:36.164
Oh, thank you.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.524
You know, listen, there are a lot of guys out there, they see an older woman,

23:38.524 --> 23:42.484
not in perfect health, with a million dollar condo in her name...

23:43.084 --> 23:45.044
Well, we've all seen 60 Minutes, haven't we?

23:45.044 --> 23:48.564
Well, I'm more a Dateline guy.
I like that Stone Phillips.

23:48.564 --> 23:49.924
Who doesn't?

23:51.284 --> 23:55.844
You know, I was a public defender for many years, and my tendency is to be suspicious.

23:55.844 --> 23:59.364
It's a problem for me, Bobby.
Well, I've got trust issues.

23:59.364 --> 24:02.124
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

24:02.964 --> 24:04.644
But I got a ways to go.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.364
- You can trust me, Sandy.
- Well, that's what I figured.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.084
You know, so I tell my cop friends, my buddies at the FBI,

24:10.084 --> 24:12.684
they say,"Sandy, Sandy, let me run a background check on this guy."

24:12.684 --> 24:14.004
You know what I say?

24:14.484 --> 24:16.044
I say,"Nah."

24:17.044 --> 24:19.084
Sophie Cohen is still pretty sharp.

24:19.084 --> 24:23.124
If she trusts you, I trust you.

24:26.844 --> 24:30.924
Great...great news.
They have fresh crab.

24:30.924 --> 24:33.084
Oh, it can't be better than Joe's.

24:33.404 --> 24:36.244
Bobby...you like Joe's Stone Crab?

24:36.244 --> 24:39.164
Yeah, I love him.

24:40.124 --> 24:43.884
I figured you'd been out of the loop for a while, you'd probably need to catch up on your movies.

24:44.364 --> 24:46.804
Margaritas and movies, sure.

24:46.804 --> 24:48.044
What do you got?

24:48.044 --> 24:52.724
Oh, the best movie of, like, all time.
The Notebook.

24:53.324 --> 24:55.604
You know, I'm kind of more a shoot- em- up type guy.

24:55.604 --> 24:57.164
Where people, like, die.

24:57.804 --> 25:00.324
Well, James Garner doesn't fare so well.

25:00.324 --> 25:03.804
Great.
If it's your favorite movie, I'm in.

25:04.364 --> 25:06.884
A toast, to you.
Thank you.

25:06.884 --> 25:09.284
Ah, to me, I like that toast.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.164
A little early.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.284
It's okay.
I just finished.

25:42.884 --> 25:44.124
You made all this?

25:44.524 --> 25:47.004
It's amazing what I can do when I'm off work.

25:48.044 --> 25:49.284
Who knew?

25:52.524 --> 25:54.484
Would you like some wine?

26:03.484 --> 26:05.524
Um, I've been doing, like, a little bit of thinking,

26:05.524 --> 26:08.364
and, you know, I'm not so sure I'm the guy for this job.

26:08.364 --> 26:11.084
- You're backing out on me?
- No, no, no. It's not that.

26:11.084 --> 26:15.684
It's just, you know, there's whipped cream and I'm a little bit lactose intolerant, so...

26:15.684 --> 26:18.204
If you back out on me I have no chance to win.

26:18.404 --> 26:20.644
And Grandma Mary Ellen won't pay her medical bills

26:20.644 --> 26:22.604
and I'll have to drop out of college.

26:24.404 --> 26:29.844
Well...I'm a fan of Medicaid and education, so...okay.

26:29.844 --> 26:31.404
Thank you.

26:31.404 --> 26:33.164
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

26:34.204 --> 26:38.324
It's almost time to get ready.
Okay, what do we do?

26:49.644 --> 26:51.724
Hey, man, can I get a bottle of water, please?

26:52.364 --> 26:53.444
How you doing?

26:53.844 --> 26:55.684
- I'm all right, you?
- Bad.

26:56.244 --> 26:57.604
I can't find my girlfriend.

26:57.604 --> 26:58.844
Oh, yeah?
Lost her in the crowd?

26:58.844 --> 27:00.124
I lost her last night.

27:00.124 --> 27:02.484
She told me she was coming to Florida to see her grandma,

27:02.484 --> 27:05.724
but her best friend told me she entered some contest down here.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.564
Immodestly revealing her body for money.

27:08.964 --> 27:11.244
Oh, well, spring break, that does happen.

27:11.244 --> 27:13.084
It doesn't happen where we're from.

27:13.604 --> 27:15.524
- Where's that?
- Bob Jones University.

27:15.524 --> 27:18.204
They find out what she's doing here, she'll be expelled.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.484
Which won't matter when she's burning in hell.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.204
- Mm, yeah, that's rough.
- The worst part is,

27:23.204 --> 27:26.044
I think she's cheating on me with whoever her partner in sin is.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.324
That's why I brought my boys with me.

27:28.724 --> 27:31.524
- Oh, yeah? Some frat brothers?
- Bible study buddies.

27:31.524 --> 27:35.004
We get a hold of who's corrupting her, it's going to be Judgment Day for him.

27:35.244 --> 27:36.604
And Mary Sue.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.444
Did you say Mary Sue?

27:54.590 --> 27:55.670
This is scandalous.

27:55.670 --> 27:58.830
I don't think I've ever finished a full bottle of wine before dinner.

27:58.830 --> 28:02.670
Is it a bad sign when you drink so much that you can't open a new bottle?

28:02.670 --> 28:05.390
Yeah, I think it means we should stop drinking.

28:06.790 --> 28:09.110
We're weakening.
Here.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.390
There.

28:22.790 --> 28:24.550
We definitely need to eat.

28:31.150 --> 28:34.150
Well, looks like the Fontainebleau and I seem to be aging nicely.

28:34.150 --> 28:36.310
Yeah, but the Fontainebleau has had a lot of work done.

28:36.310 --> 28:39.710
This au natural thing is why I'm beating them off with a stick.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.990
Speaking of which, where is Bobby?
He should have been here by now.

28:42.990 --> 28:46.310
Didn't he say he was going to be, uh, stopping off at his office?

28:46.310 --> 28:48.230
- How far is that from here?
- Not all that far.

28:48.230 --> 28:49.950
I hope nothing is wrong.

28:52.790 --> 28:55.430
Look at ma with a cell phone.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.390
- I'm very hip.
- I guess so.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.870
- I just can't read the buttons.
- Let me see.

29:02.550 --> 29:05.390
Bobby, where are you?
We're waiting for you.

29:05.990 --> 29:07.270
What?

29:08.350 --> 29:10.270
A malpractice suit?

29:10.270 --> 29:11.750
Sweetheart, that's terrible.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.230
Come over here so we can talk about it.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.430
The airport?
Where are you going?

29:21.190 --> 29:24.470
Well, how long before you think this thing blows over?

29:28.310 --> 29:29.950
I see.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.350
Good- bye.

29:44.590 --> 29:46.750
Bobby won't be joining us.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.270
Just like that, huh?

29:54.230 --> 29:56.190
What did you say to him?

30:13.430 --> 30:16.670
Oh, man, okay, you are way too good at this,

30:16.670 --> 30:19.790
'cause I've lost, like, ten times in a row.

30:19.790 --> 30:22.950
Yeah, well, I was All- Chino in drinking.

30:22.950 --> 30:26.390
Yeah, well, I thought I was All- Newport, but clearly you're in a league of your own,

30:26.390 --> 30:29.870
because I'm...wow.

30:30.750 --> 30:34.070
Maybe we should watch that movie.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.750
You know, maybe we should get some air first,

30:55.750 --> 30:58.750
'cause I don't want to fall asleep during the movie.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.230
It's really good.

31:01.070 --> 31:04.430
Uh, yeah. Sure.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.390
Let's do it.

31:11.390 --> 31:13.870
I definitely need some air.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.430
Hey, you know what?
I will be right there.

31:16.430 --> 31:18.150
I just need to grab my jacket.

31:40.190 --> 31:43.190
A'ight! This next contest is dirty, y'all!

31:43.190 --> 31:48.310
It's off the chain, it's bananz- oh, bananas, oh, bananas, oh, bananas!

31:48.310 --> 31:51.310
- Come on!
- Who likes whipped cream?

31:53.190 --> 31:57.430
Now let's see which of these four guys is truly whipped.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.590
Give it up, you all.

32:07.150 --> 32:10.630
Come on! Whipped cream!
Yeah!

32:10.630 --> 32:12.110
Paint that body!

32:13.070 --> 32:15.190
Paint that body!

32:16.710 --> 32:18.310
There she is.

32:18.790 --> 32:24.270
It's time to bring fire and brimstone down on her and that skinny little sinner.

32:26.590 --> 32:28.230
Whoo! Come on!

32:29.910 --> 32:33.910
Hot teen sundae! Go!
Come on, y'all.

32:34.430 --> 32:35.710
Lick the cream!

32:36.590 --> 32:38.710
Oh, my God, I love gnocchi.

32:38.710 --> 32:40.830
It's like an Italian dumpling.
What a concept.

32:40.830 --> 32:42.750
Did you want more?
I made tons.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.630
Yeah, thanks.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.470
This is that event where you have to eat whipped cream off some girl.

32:53.470 --> 32:56.030
That is so disgusting.
What girl would agree to that?

32:56.390 --> 33:00.870
What guy would be pathetic enough to humiliate himself on national television?

33:02.070 --> 33:04.190
Lick the cream!

33:07.470 --> 33:12.110
I hope this is enough sauce.
Uh...I put a whole bunch, so...

33:16.390 --> 33:18.750
I...I guess you liked the gnocchi.

33:23.110 --> 33:25.230
Somebody done won!

33:35.950 --> 33:37.310
Ryan, we won.

33:37.310 --> 33:38.270
Yeah, I know.
We got to get...

33:38.270 --> 33:40.230
- What?
- Oh, looks like my boyfriend.

33:40.230 --> 33:41.550
Your what?

33:42.390 --> 33:43.510
Hey, who are those guys?

33:43.510 --> 33:45.830
Uh, they're in the same Bible study class.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.470
Oh. Think we can convince them to turn the other cheek?

33:48.470 --> 33:50.830
- Prepare to meet your maker.
- Looks like not.

34:01.950 --> 34:03.350
I'm sorry, Ma.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.590
I was looking out for you.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.550
I know.

34:22.350 --> 34:24.350
I guess part of me knew.

34:25.389 --> 34:28.270
I guess that's why I wanted you to come down here.

34:30.429 --> 34:31.949
I just...

34:32.389 --> 34:37.710
wanted to believe I wasn't going to be spending the rest of my life alone.

34:37.710 --> 34:38.830
I could extend my trip.

34:38.830 --> 34:41.550
- Spend some more time down here.
- Please, sweetheart.

34:41.550 --> 34:46.070
You have someone you love back home.
You should be with her.

34:48.590 --> 34:52.989
But it would be very nice if you visited your old mother a little more often.

34:53.949 --> 34:55.190
All right.

34:56.510 --> 34:59.630
I think that was the best meal I've ever had.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.310
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

35:01.830 --> 35:05.830
- I'll tell the chef.
- I thought I was telling the chef.

35:05.830 --> 35:08.790
- Okay...confession.
- Yeah?

35:10.310 --> 35:12.030
I had the meal catered.

35:12.470 --> 35:14.990
I am the worlïs worst cook.

35:18.750 --> 35:23.510
Well, okay, but, so you went to all this trouble, why blow your cover now?

35:23.510 --> 35:25.790
Oh, maybe it's the wine.

35:26.230 --> 35:29.870
But I think it's because I can't lie to you.

35:32.870 --> 35:34.550
I know the feeling.

35:36.230 --> 35:39.030
So while we're being honest with each other,

35:39.030 --> 35:41.790
you know this incredible job I was just offered?

35:41.790 --> 35:43.430
I almost didn't take it.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.710
Because I didn't want to leave.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.190
That's nice, because in the beginning you hated Newport.

35:51.390 --> 35:54.670
Well, it wasn't Newport I didn't want to leave.

36:18.430 --> 36:21.150
Good luck with your new job, Carter.

36:35.510 --> 36:37.590
So long, Kirsten.

37:45.510 --> 37:48.110
- How you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

37:48.110 --> 37:49.950
Yeah. How could you not?

37:50.190 --> 37:51.710
What a night.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.110
Look at this place.

37:56.310 --> 37:57.710
It's pretty great.

37:58.190 --> 37:59.510
It's amazing.

38:00.270 --> 38:05.710
I got a job, a great place, great friends.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.870
Come on, come on, come on, howl with me.

38:16.350 --> 38:17.230
Come on.

38:19.950 --> 38:21.470
Dude, that was terrible.

38:21.470 --> 38:23.110
What? I'm not one for the howling.

38:23.110 --> 38:24.110
Oh, no?

38:24.110 --> 38:26.190
You just need to be woken up.

38:32.430 --> 38:36.510
Hey, you know, when I'm with you I feel like I can do anything.

38:36.510 --> 38:37.790
And...

38:38.670 --> 38:41.070
I've never felt that way before.

38:43.150 --> 38:44.510
That's sweet.

38:44.510 --> 38:49.670
You know, we're not so different, you and me.

38:49.670 --> 38:52.470
Hey, you know, I think maybe it's time...

38:52.470 --> 38:54.750
Wait, wait, wait.
Where you going?

38:55.270 --> 38:57.190
- Trey, what are you..?
- Come on, come on.

38:57.510 --> 38:59.670
I've seen the way you look at me.

39:00.470 --> 39:03.070
You know, no one's ever been this nice to me.

39:03.070 --> 39:04.670
Yeah, because you're Ryan's brother.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.430
No, it's more than that, and you know it.

39:06.430 --> 39:09.150
And I get it.
You don't want to hurt him.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.110
But he doesn't have to know.

39:11.110 --> 39:13.670
No, Trey.
No. No way. Okay?

39:13.670 --> 39:14.830
Never. What?

39:14.830 --> 39:16.110
What, wait, wait, wait.

39:16.110 --> 39:19.190
- What, I'm not good enough?
- No, look, I don't mean it like that.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.350
- Okay, just let go.
- Come on, come on.

39:20.350 --> 39:23.870
Look, Ryan gets all the good life, huh? Right?

39:25.510 --> 39:26.950
Get off of me.

39:27.670 --> 39:30.510
Come on.
No one needs to know.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.870
Get off me!
Off of me...

39:32.870 --> 39:36.110
Please. Help.

40:01.590 --> 40:04.430
Dude, look what you've done!

40:11.470 --> 40:14.510
I guess those guys really do believe in an eye for an eye.

40:15.550 --> 40:17.590
- Hungry?
- I'll pass.

40:18.270 --> 40:20.190
It's too bad we can't tell anyone what happened.

40:20.190 --> 40:22.430
No one would believe us anyway.

40:22.430 --> 40:25.190
Yeah, it's probably best I don't tell Summer.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.710
Yeah, you know what, man?
I'm going to call Marissa.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.110
Check in, see how she and Trey are doing.

40:29.110 --> 40:29.790
All right.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.390
I'm going to go back to the room and...lick myself clean.

40:32.390 --> 40:34.310
Night.
