WEBVTT

00:02.542 --> 00:05.166
-I'M SO SORRY.

00:05.208 --> 00:07.291
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.333
I CAN CHANGE.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.667
I SWEAR.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.500
PLEASE, TAKE ME BACK.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.792
I LOVE YOU.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.834
-LOOK, I READ THE MEDIA

00:20.083 --> 00:22.834
REPORTS BUT I WANT TO

00:22.875 --> 00:23.834
HEAR IT FROM YOU.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.250
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:25.291 --> 00:28.458
AND START WITH THE BOWL GAME,

00:25.291 --> 00:28.458
AND I WANT THE TRUTH.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.375
-OK.

00:33.583 --> 00:37.291
I THOUGHT WE HAD THE TITLE ON

00:33.583 --> 00:37.291
LOCK, COACH AND WHEN WE LOST,

00:37.333 --> 00:38.875
I WAS SO SAD.

00:38.917 --> 00:41.542
I COULDN'T EVEN TALK TO THE

00:38.917 --> 00:41.542
REPORTERS AT MY LOCKER.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.417
I WANT TO TALK TO EVERY REPORTER

00:41.583 --> 00:44.417
IN THIS LOCKER ROOM.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.959
I HAVE A LOT TO SAY.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.333
THAT GAME WAS BULLSHIT.

00:47.375 --> 00:49.375
THOSE REFS HAD IT OUT FOR

00:47.375 --> 00:49.375
US FROM THE START.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.333
-THAD, TELL ME, IS RADON

00:49.417 --> 00:51.333
GOING TO BE OK?

00:51.375 --> 00:52.709
-RADON MESSED UP HIS

00:51.375 --> 00:52.709
SHOULDER AGAIN.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.083
THAT'S ALL HAVE TO SAY.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.041
-THAD, ONE MORE QUESTION, DO

00:54.125 --> 00:55.041
YOU THINK HE'LL BE BACK?

00:55.083 --> 00:56.458
-IS HE COMING BACK?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.000
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,

00:56.500 --> 00:59.000
A FUTURE TELLER?

00:59.041 --> 01:01.583
AFTER THE GAME I WENT

00:59.041 --> 01:01.583
STRAIGHT BACK TO THE

01:01.625 --> 01:03.125
HOTEL TO GO TO BED.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.667
DRUGS, DRUGS, DRUGS, DRUGS, HEY,

01:03.166 --> 01:05.667
I'M LOOKING TO BUY DRUGS.

01:05.709 --> 01:06.667
YOU GOT ANY DRUGS?

01:06.709 --> 01:08.250
I JUST WANT TO BUY SOME DRUGS.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.834
BUT THEN I GOT SIDETRACKED BY

01:08.291 --> 01:10.834
THESE GIRLS THAT WANTED TO

01:10.875 --> 01:12.667
INVITE ME TO THEIR ROOM

01:10.875 --> 01:12.667
FOR A PIZZA PARTY.

01:12.709 --> 01:15.041
-HEY.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.667
-COCAINE, YEAH, BABY.

01:17.709 --> 01:19.834
THAT'S WHO'S THE KING

01:17.709 --> 01:19.834
OF FOOTBALL NOW.

01:19.875 --> 01:22.291
MARTY DANIELS CAN

01:19.875 --> 01:22.291
SUCK MY BALLS.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.709
HE'S THE REASON WE LOST TODAY.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.667
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE LET ME

01:24.750 --> 01:26.667
TRY THAT 56-YARDER.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.125
I'M GOING TO GO PRO.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.792
I'M GOING TO BE A BILLIONAIRE.

01:29.834 --> 01:31.750
LAST THING I REMEMBER, ONE OF

01:29.834 --> 01:31.750
THE GIRLS ASKED ME IF I WANTED

01:31.792 --> 01:33.458
TO SEE HER DAD'S BOAT.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.917
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

01:33.500 --> 01:34.917
CONVINCED ME.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.000
I HATE BOATS.

01:36.041 --> 01:38.834
-I LOVE BOATS.

01:38.875 --> 01:43.875
THE NEXT MORNING I WOKE UP AND

01:38.875 --> 01:43.875
THE SWEET GIRLS WERE GONE.

01:43.917 --> 01:47.375
-ARE THERE ANY DRUGS

01:43.917 --> 01:47.375
ON THIS BOAT?

01:47.417 --> 01:49.875
-NO.

01:49.917 --> 01:52.750
ONCE THE MEDIA STARTED SPREADING

01:49.917 --> 01:52.750
THEIR LIES, I KNEW

01:52.792 --> 01:55.083
NO NFL TEAM WAS GOING

01:52.792 --> 01:55.083
TO TOUCH ME.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.917
I NEVER DECLARED MYSELF

01:55.125 --> 01:56.917
FOR THE DRAFT.

01:56.959 --> 01:58.500
I AM STILL ELIGIBLE.

01:58.542 --> 02:00.417
PLEASE, I'LL WORK SO HARD

01:58.542 --> 02:00.417
FOR YOU, COACH.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.709

02:07.417 --> 02:09.125

05:36.333 --> 05:38.083
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT

05:36.333 --> 05:38.083

FIVE DECENT QUARTERS OF

05:40.625 --> 05:42.667
FOOTBALL IN THE PAST

05:40.625 --> 05:42.667
TWO YEARS?

05:42.709 --> 05:44.625
-HE'S OUR BEST OPTION

05:44.667 --> 05:47.000
-I DON'T MEAN TO STEP

05:47.041 --> 05:49.625
I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU TOOK A

05:47.041 --> 05:49.625
LOOK AT THE OFFENSE THAT I RAN

05:49.667 --> 05:51.208
AT STANFORD.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.834
IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE COMPLEX

05:51.250 --> 05:52.834
THAN WHAT YOU GUYS ARE USED TO

05:52.875 --> 05:53.834
HERE, BUT--

05:53.875 --> 05:55.875
-YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MORAN.

NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR,

06:08.792 --> 06:10.000

YOU GUYS SHOULD SPEND

06:10.041 --> 06:11.875
TIME TOGETHER, GET

06:11.917 --> 06:13.250

-BECAUSE YOU'RE OUR STARTING

06:14.458 --> 06:16.333
QUARTERBACK.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.375
-ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO TALK TO

06:28.667 --> 06:30.500
-THE KID WANTS TO TAKE

06:28.667 --> 06:30.500
A YEAR OFF, COACH.

06:30.542 --> 06:33.417
I HARDLY THINK THAT MAKES

06:30.542 --> 06:33.417
HIM A LEADER.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.917
-REALLY?

-CAPTAIN?

06:59.667 --> 07:01.667

14:44.375 --> 14:45.542
BECAUSE SOME UNGRATEFUL

14:44.375 --> 14:45.542
PRICKS GAVE YOU A

14:45.583 --> 14:47.291
JOB ON A SILVER PLATTER?

14:47.333 --> 14:49.834
I WAS WINNING CHAMPIONSHIPS

14:47.333 --> 14:49.834
BEFORE YOU DISCOVERED HOW TO

14:49.875 --> 14:50.875
JERK OFF.

14:50.917 --> 14:51.917
-NICE.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.375
-DON'T EVER GO OVER

14:51.959 --> 14:53.375
MY HEAD AGAIN.

14:53.417 --> 14:54.917
-YOU WANT TO WIN SOME GAMES?

14:54.959 --> 14:56.417
THEN WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.083
WE CAN ALL SEE THAT.

14:59.125 --> 15:02.083
BUT YOU DON'T.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.709
MAYBE THAT IS WHY I AM HERE.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.417
-OK, YOU ARE A COACH IN

15:03.750 --> 15:06.417
WAITING, SO JUST WAIT.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.834

15:09.875 --> 15:12.500

15:09.875 --> 15:12.500
REALIZES WHO HE'S DEALING

15:12.542 --> 15:13.500
WITH.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.041
-YEAH, COACH SEEMS PISSED.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.917
-I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT COACH.

15:18.959 --> 15:19.917
-ALEX.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.875
ALEX, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU MAN?

15:22.917 --> 15:25.208
-I DIDN'T COME TO THIS SCHOOL

15:22.917 --> 15:25.208
TO BE A HERO, RIGHT?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.750
I CAME HERE TO HAVE FUN.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.458
AND IF THESE COACHES WANT

15:26.792 --> 15:28.458
TO USE ME, FINE.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.458
LET THEM.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.834
I'M GOING TO USE THEM, TOO.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.917
-I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

15:30.875 --> 15:32.917
THAT MEANS.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.792
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE INDUCTION

15:32.959 --> 15:34.792

15:38.291 --> 15:40.000

15:40.041 --> 15:42.291
MY ROOM AT THE GOAT HOUSE

15:40.041 --> 15:42.291
DEPENDS ON IT.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.333
I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST MASCOT

15:42.333 --> 15:44.333
TO LIVE AT THE GOAT

15:44.375 --> 15:46.542

16:22.208 --> 16:24.709
YOUR LETTER OF INTENT

16:24.750 --> 16:26.208
YOU MADE A COMMITMENT

16:24.750 --> 16:26.208
TO YOUR COACH.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.333
-I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMMITMENT,

16:26.250 --> 16:29.333
AND I KNOW FOR A

16:29.375 --> 16:30.792

16:59.166 --> 17:02.625
BEING THE STARTING QUARTERBACK

17:02.667 --> 17:04.166
OF THE WINNING TEAM.

17:04.208 --> 17:07.417
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME

17:04.208 --> 17:07.417

17:07.458 --> 17:10.375
WOULD BE THAT TIME.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.417
WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.
