GRACI.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.667

00:53.700 --> 00:54.833
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.200

SO REMEMBER OUR...

01:17.633 --> 01:18.733

01:18.767 --> 01:21.367

BEEN CLOSED TO ANYTHING ?

01:21.400 --> 01:22.933
OKAY.

OKAY, NO, NO, YEAH.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.733
AND SOME FRIENDS,
FAMILY THAT KIND OF THING.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.367
OH MY GOSH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID YES TO THAT.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.900
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU JUST,
YOU BUILT IT ALL UP.

01:42.933 --> 01:45.367

HOW I WAS GONNA BRING UP,

01:45.400 --> 01:46.367
BUT THANK YOU.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.600
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE A HUGE FIGHT.

01:47.633 --> 01:48.900
YEAH, YEAH.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.633
WELL, NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
MY 10th ANNIVERSARY PRESENT.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.567
ALRIGHT,
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ?

01:54.600 --> 01:59.100
I BELIEVE MY PRESENT HAS
ALREADY BEEN AGREED UPON.

01:59.133 --> 01:59.833
REALLY ?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.067
YES.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.700
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

02:03.733 --> 02:05.400
WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT THIS ?

02:05.433 --> 02:06.567
RIGHT HERE
AT THIS RESTAURANT.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.700
REALLY ?

02:07.733 --> 02:09.300
10 YEARS AGO RIGHT
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.567
IN THESE SEATS,
SAME SEATS.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.767
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
MARRIED ALREADY.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.433
WE'RE JUST
MAKING IT LEGAL.

02:17.467 --> 02:20.200
IT'S JUST GONNA BE,
YOU KNOW, PERMANENT

02:20.233 --> 02:25.333
AND MY FRIENDS THINK I'M CRAZY,
BUT I DO I JUST...

02:25.367 --> 02:27.633
WELL HOW, THEY THINK
YOU'RE CRAZY, HOW DARE THEY ?

02:27.667 --> 02:29.700
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.233
WHICH FRIENDS
THINK YOU'RE CRAZY ?

02:31.267 --> 02:34.433
I DON'T WANT TO NAME NAMES,
BUT LOOK IT'S WORKING, RIGHT ?

02:34.467 --> 02:35.667
WHO, JULIE ?

02:35.700 --> 02:37.600
SHE THINKS,
SHE THINKS YOU'RE CRAZY ?

02:37.633 --> 02:39.933
I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD
BE A FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.433
WE SHOULD SHARE
THE SAME LAST NAME.

02:41.467 --> 02:42.800
I WANT TO BE
CHERYL DAVID.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.533
DAVID, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO BE A DAVID FOR ?

02:44.567 --> 02:45.967
I WANT TO BE YOUR WIFE...

02:46.067 --> 02:47.433
DAVIDS WANT TO BE
OUT OF BEING DAVID.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.700
I DON'T WANT TO BE A DAVID,
I HAVE TO BE A DAVID.

02:49.733 --> 02:51.667
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A DAVID, WHY BE A DAVID ?

02:51.700 --> 02:54.133
I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO BE A DAVID.

02:54.167 --> 02:58.733
IS IT, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE SEX

02:58.767 --> 03:00.700
WITH SOMEONE ELSE FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ?

03:00.733 --> 03:01.967
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ?

03:02.067 --> 03:03.067
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT ? NO.

03:03.067 --> 03:06.067
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ?

03:06.067 --> 03:09.400
OKAY, OKAY.

03:09.433 --> 03:14.733
HOW ABOUT IF WE GET MARRIED NOW,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW,

03:14.767 --> 03:18.667
FOR OUR 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY YOU
CAN HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE ?

03:18.700 --> 03:21.133
WHAT ?

03:21.167 --> 03:25.900
IF THAT'S YOUR HOLD UP HERE
THEN LET'S JUST DO THAT.

03:25.933 --> 03:29.700
COME ON, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LET ME DO THAT.

03:29.733 --> 03:30.433
WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING THAT FOR ?

03:30.467 --> 03:31.567
I WILL.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.667
JUST SEX ONE TIME,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

03:43.133 --> 03:45.767
OH, RIGHT !

03:45.800 --> 03:51.167
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
REMEMBER THAT SO WELL.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.200
YES, I DID REMEMBER.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.267
YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.833
FOR SOME THINGS.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.067
YEAH.
YEAH, FOR SOME THINGS.

04:00.067 --> 04:05.367
ALRIGHT WELL, I SAID YOU
COULD HAVE SEX WITH SOMEBODY

04:05.400 --> 04:07.567
AND YOU SHOULD DO THAT,
IT'S OUR 10th ANNIVERSARY.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.567
YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.167
I'M JOKING AROUND,
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.533
NO, NO, NO,
NO, YOU SHOULD.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.067
I SAID IT
10 YEARS AGO.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.967
YOU SHOULD GO OUT
AND HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.233
NO, NO,
IT'S NICE, BUT...

04:18.267 --> 04:19.467
NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.833
THANK YOU, THAT'S SWEET THAT
YOU WANT TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

04:21.867 --> 04:22.867
I'M INSISTING ON IT.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.067
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR WORD
AND EVERYTHING.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.633
NO, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
HAVE SEX WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

04:28.667 --> 04:30.467
THEN YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.733
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

04:32.767 --> 04:38.567
OKAY, "LADY, I'M LARRY DAVID
AND MY WIFE SAID

04:38.600 --> 04:40.233
I COULD HAVE SEX
WITH SOMEBODY TONIGHT."

04:40.267 --> 04:42.667
FIRST OF ALL
I'M INSULTED, OKAY.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.900
YOU ARE ?

04:43.933 --> 04:45.933
EVEN IF I WANTED TO, YOU DON'T
THINK I'M CAPABLE OF IT.

04:45.967 --> 04:48.600
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF IT.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.733
I REALLY DON'T.

04:50.767 --> 04:56.367
THAT'S WHY I THINK
YOU, UM...

04:56.400 --> 04:57.333
SO IF I DO THIS OKAY...

04:57.367 --> 04:58.333
MM-HMM.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.067
JUST SO THERE'S NO
MISUNDERSTANDING HERE.

05:00.067 --> 05:00.700
IT'S OKAY WITH YOU ?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.633
MM-HMM.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.900
IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY
AND SAY HEY...

05:04.933 --> 05:06.300
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY CRYING AFTERWARDS.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.200
NO, AND SAY OH, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.733
NO, I WOULD NOT
BE CRYING.

05:10.767 --> 05:12.800
HUH ?

05:12.833 --> 05:15.367
OH BOY, ALRIGHT,
WELL THANK YOU.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.433
THANK YOU FOR MY
10th ANNIVERSARY PRESENT.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.300
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.600
HOW LONG DO I
HAVE TO DO THIS ?

05:18.633 --> 05:23.667
WELL, YOU HAVE UNTIL OUR
ANNIVERSARY AND THAT'S IT.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.667
GOOD LUCK.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.967
I JUST HOPE JEFF IS GONNA
BE AT THAT KARAOKE PARTY

05:32.067 --> 05:34.800
BECAUSE I HAVE GOT A LOT
TO SAY TO THAT YOUNG MAN.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.900
LISTEN, LISTEN MAYBE WE SHOULD
SKIP THE KARAOKE PARTY.

05:37.933 --> 05:39.167
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO SKIP KARAOKE ?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
OH, IT'S HORRIBLE.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.367
HORRIBLE ?

05:41.400 --> 05:44.067

WORTH YOUR WHILE.

BECAUSE I WANT
TO GO TO KARAOKE.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.967
OH MY GOD.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.067

06:01.833 --> 06:07.133

FOUND YOU JUST IN TIME *

06:07.167 --> 06:12.233
* BEFORE YOU CAME
IN TIME *

06:12.267 --> 06:14.533
DO YOU KNOW MARRIED MEN
EVERYWHERE

06:14.567 --> 06:17.600

THEIR WIFE SAYS OH GO AHEAD.

06:17.633 --> 06:18.600
WHAT'S MEL DOING HERE ?

06:18.633 --> 06:20.767

06:20.800 --> 06:22.233
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT ?

06:22.267 --> 06:22.833
OH.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.267
THEY'RE OLD FRIENDS.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.533

ALL WERE CROSSED *

06:27.567 --> 06:29.767

06:32.667 --> 06:33.600
COME ON, MAN.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.700
SHE ACTUALLY
CHALLENGED ME TO DO IT.

06:35.733 --> 06:36.933
WELL, DAMNIT MAN, DO IT !

06:36.967 --> 06:37.833
SHE WAS LAUGHING AT ME.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.300
YOU'VE GOT TO, MAN.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.300
WELL, WHO I AM SUPPOSED
TO DO THIS WITH ?

06:41.333 --> 06:43.067
I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEBODY THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.467
WE'VE ALL--

06:44.500 --> 06:46.433
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I COULD
WALK UP TO THEM AND DO ANYTHING.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.967
I DON'T, YOU KNOW...

06:48.067 --> 06:49.267
BUT NOW YOU'VE
GOT PERMISSION.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.400
THIS IS THE THING THAT I'M THE
WORST AT IN THE WORLD, THIS.

06:51.433 --> 06:52.700
THIS AND DRAWING.

06:52.733 --> 06:55.633
IT'S A BIG THING TO DRAW,
HOW COULD I DO THAT ?

06:55.667 --> 06:56.733
DO YOU THINK
I COULD DO IT ?

06:56.767 --> 07:01.167
YEAH, UH-HUH ?

07:04.533 --> 07:05.567
IT'S A START, GO.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.333
YOU WANT TO SEE HOW
INEPT I REALLY AM, HUH ?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.700
I WANT TO SEE
YOU IN ACTION.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.133
DO YOU, YOU WANT
TO SEE THIS ?

07:12.167 --> 07:13.533
JUST GO, GO, YEAH,

07:16.567 --> 07:18.067
GO AHEAD.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.700
* HEY, WE'RE ALL HERE

07:20.733 --> 07:26.133
* AND NOW I KNOW JUST
WHERE I'M GOING *

07:26.167 --> 07:27.567
DO YOU LIKE KARAOKE ?

07:27.600 --> 07:28.900
YEAH.

07:28.933 --> 07:33.133
IT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING TO DO AT NIGHT.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.067
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO AT NIGHT.

07:34.067 --> 07:34.833
WHAT CAN YOU
DO AT NIGHT ?

07:34.867 --> 07:36.300
BOWLING, MOVIES.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.767
IT'S LIKE A THIRD THING TO DO
AFTER BOWLING AND THE MOVIES.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.833
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BOWL OR NOT,
I DON'T GO THAT OFTEN,

07:40.867 --> 07:43.067
BUT IT'S FUN,
IT'S FUN.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.733
YOU CAN'T FIND A BALL,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.400
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
YOU OWN A BOWLING BALL.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.633
I DON'T OWN
A BOWLING BALL.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.267
MY WHOLE LIFEVERY TIME
I'M IN A BOWLING ALLEY

07:49.300 --> 07:51.133
STICKING MY FINGERS
IN ALL THESE HOLES,
PICKING UP THE BALLS.

07:51.167 --> 07:54.800
YOU GOT TO GET
YOUR OWN BALL.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.767
I DON'T BOWL ENOUGH
TO THINK TO GET MY OWN BALL.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.067
IT TAKES UP A LOT
OF SPACE IN THE HOUSE.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.867
YOU KEEP LOOKING AT IT
IN THE CLOSET GOING

07:59.900 --> 08:01.100
WHAT I AM DOING
WITH A BOWLING BALL ?

08:01.133 --> 08:03.800
I DON'T EVEN BOWL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

08:03.833 --> 08:06.333
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET RID OF THE BALL.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.500
HOW DO YOU GET RID
OF A BOWLING BALL ?

08:08.533 --> 08:09.567
THINK ABOUT THAT.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.167
WHO DO YOU GIVE
A BOWLING BALL TO ?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.800
NOBODY BOWLS.

08:12.833 --> 08:15.333
THE THING, IT ONLY
FITS YOUR FINGERS.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.133
YOU THROW A BOWLING BALL
IN THE GARBAGE CAN,

08:17.167 --> 08:18.800
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
SANITATION MAN'S GONNA DO ?

08:18.833 --> 08:20.400
HE'S GONNA
KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.667
THAT'S HOW UPSET
HE'S GONNA BE.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.700
HE'S GONNA SAY WHO THE FUCK
THREW A BOWLING BALL

08:23.733 --> 08:25.667
IN THE GARBAGE CAN ?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.300
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

08:30.333 --> 08:34.067
I'M AROUND TOWN.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.467
HOW DID IT GO ?

08:40.500 --> 08:44.100
* THAT LUCKY DAY

08:44.133 --> 08:52.733
* HEY, MY LONELY, LONELY LIFE
THAT LUCKY DAY *

08:52.767 --> 08:56.733
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

09:01.067 --> 09:02.067
COME ON, EVERYBODY.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.533
PUT IT TOGETHER,
MEL BROOKS.

09:03.567 --> 09:05.067
HOW ABOUT THAT ?

09:05.067 --> 09:07.333
THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.233
ALRIGHT, NOW WHO
WANTS TO GO NEXT ?

09:09.267 --> 09:10.433
HUH, ANYONE ?

09:10.467 --> 09:11.767
LOOK HEY, LARRY DAVID.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.267
OH, COME ON.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.267

COME UP AND GIVE US A SONG ?

09:15.300 --> 09:16.300
OH COME ON,
STOP IT.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.567
COME ON, LAR.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.467
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

09:19.500 --> 09:22.467
OH, I CAN'T DO IT.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.067
ALRIGHT.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.367
ALRIGHT.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.833
OH, SHUT UP !

09:36.200 --> 09:38.967
* I'VE BEEN AWAY
FROM YOU A LONG TIME *

09:39.067 --> 09:42.367
* I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D MISS YOU SO *

09:42.400 --> 09:46.500
* SOMEHOW I FEEL
YOUR LOVE IS REAL *

09:46.533 --> 09:50.333
* SWANNEE, YOU'RE CALLING ME
YOU CRAZY RIVER *

09:50.367 --> 09:58.400
* SWANNEE HOW I, HOW I LOVE YOU
MY DEAR OLD SWANNEE *

09:58.433 --> 09:59.633
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
MEL BROOKS WANTS ?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.367
I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.467
USUALLY I KNOW.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.233
SO HE JUST CALLED OUT OF
THE CLEAR BLUE SKY ?

10:04.267 --> 10:05.400
OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE SKY.

10:05.433 --> 10:07.167
HE'S ONE OF MY IDOLS,
YOU KNOW.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.333
I KNOW HE IS, THAT'S WHY
I WAS EXCITED FOR YOU.

10:09.367 --> 10:12.600
HEY !

10:12.633 --> 10:13.733
I'LL CALL,
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.433

YOU CUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
YOU'RE TALKING ON A CELLPHONE ?

10:24.767 --> 10:26.333
WHAT, THERE'S A LAW AGAINST
TALKING ON A CELLPHONE ?

10:26.367 --> 10:28.767
NO, YOU CAN'T, NOT WHILE
YOU'RE WHEELING AROUND.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.100
YOU ALMOST HIT MY CAR.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.733
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
MY CAR, YOU FUCKIN'--

10:31.767 --> 10:32.967
OH LEARN HOW
TO DRIVE THAT THING.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.233
PISS OFF,

10:34.267 --> 10:35.267
OH, ASSHOLE.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.267

PISS OFF !

10:40.800 --> 10:44.867
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

10:44.900 --> 10:45.767
YEAH ?

10:45.800 --> 10:49.033
WOW, THERE'S
MONEY IN HERE.

11:01.067 --> 11:04.867
LARRY DAVID,
JEFF GREENE TO SEE MEL.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.433
HE'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A SECOND, HAVE A SEAT.

11:06.467 --> 11:10.767
YOU KNOW WHAT, I FOUND
THIS THING IN THE LOBBY.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.733
OH.

11:11.767 --> 11:14.833
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE DEAL IS.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.833
UH, ACTUALLY THIS
BELONGS TO DENNIS.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.333
HE DOES THE COMPUTERS
IN THE BUILDING.

11:18.367 --> 11:21.067
IT PROBABLY FELL OUT OF HIS
CHAIR THIS MORNING OR SOMETHING.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.300
CHAIR ?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.467
YEAH, HE'S
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.733
I'LL BET THAT'S THE GUY,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

11:26.767 --> 11:29.733
A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR
CUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY CAR

11:29.767 --> 11:30.567
IN THE PARKING LOT.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.100
I ALMOST HIT HIM.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.767
HE WAS TALKING
ON HIS CELLPHONE.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.833
YEAH, WELL, HE'S IN A,
HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.633
YEAH, I KNOW,
IT'S A MOVING VEHICLE.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.967
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND
OF REGULATIONS I WOULD THINK

11:41.067 --> 11:42.933
EVEN FOR PEOPLE
IN ELECTRIC CHAIRS.

11:42.967 --> 11:43.900
MM-HMM.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.167
HE'S MOTORING ALONG.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.067
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
TALKING ON A CELLPHONE.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.800
IT'S DANGEROUS.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.267
MEL WILL BE RIGHT OUT.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.867
NAMES FOR BABIES,
IS THAT YOU ?

11:53.900 --> 11:57.067
YES, ACTUALLY MY PARTNER AND I
ARE ADOPTING A BABY.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.567
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A PARTNER.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.533
I GOT A WIFE.

12:00.567 --> 12:01.733
MM.

12:01.767 --> 12:02.867
NOT EXACTLY A PARTNER.

12:02.900 --> 12:06.667
MORE LIKE A RIVAL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

12:06.700 --> 12:08.533
IT'S A RIVALRY.

12:08.567 --> 12:12.200
I WISH I COULD SAY
THIS IS MY PARTNER.

12:12.233 --> 12:15.533
SO LET ME ASK YOU, YOU GOT ANY,
YOU GOT ANY NAMES PICKED OUT ?

12:15.567 --> 12:16.933
UH, ACTUALLY WE DO.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.600
IS IT, UH, A BOY
OR WHAT ARE YOU...

12:18.633 --> 12:19.867
IT'S A BOY.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.067
UH, AND WE ARE
ADOPTING HIM FROM CHINA.

12:22.067 --> 12:23.867
AH, ADOPTING FROM CHINA.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.933
MM-HMM.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.700
CHINESE NAMES, DO I KNOW
ANY CHINESE NAMES ?

12:26.733 --> 12:28.233
WELL YOU GOT, UH...

12:28.267 --> 12:30.133
YOU GOT WANG
FROM THE GOOD EARTH.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.333
REMEMBER WANG LUNG ?

12:31.367 --> 12:34.833
WANG ISN'T A BAD
FIRST NAME.

12:34.867 --> 12:35.867
WANG ?

12:35.900 --> 12:38.667
THEN YOU GOT
THE WHOLE ANG FAMILY.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.700
FANG, BANG, TANG.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.700
TANG IS NOT ACTUALLY
A BAD NAME

12:44.733 --> 12:47.367
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE CHINA
BUT IT'S, IT'S NOT CHINA.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.300
IT'S A JUICE
IS WHAT IT IS.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.733
TANG.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.300
IS THAT SO BAD NAMING
A KID AFTER A JUICE ?

12:55.333 --> 12:56.667
MAYBE THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.833
BUT IT HAS CHINESE
OVERTONES, TANG.

12:59.867 --> 13:00.700
BUT YET THERE'S A...

13:00.733 --> 13:01.533
TANG.

13:01.567 --> 13:02.667
YOU GOT A LITTLE
JOLT WITH IT.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.067
MM-HMM, YEAH.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.800
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD GO OVER
TOO WELL WITH THE SCHOOL KIDS.

13:05.833 --> 13:09.067
UH, THAT'S GONNA BE
THE LEAST OF HIS PROBLEMS, NO ?

13:09.067 --> 13:12.067
MEL WILL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA
RUN TO THE BATHROOM.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.800
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.700
OH, OH, OOH !

13:24.733 --> 13:26.233
OH MY GOD, WHAT--

13:26.267 --> 13:29.133
LARRY,
LARRY DAVID.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.633
OH MY GOD.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.467
OOH, DID I HURT YOU ?
I'M SO SORRY.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.100
IS IT BAD ?

13:34.133 --> 13:35.300
IS IT BAD ?

13:35.333 --> 13:35.833
NO, NO, IT'LL
BE ALRIGHT.

13:35.867 --> 13:36.900
IS IT BAD ?

13:36.933 --> 13:38.233
NO, I GOT TO GET, UH,
LET ME GET SOME HELP.

13:38.267 --> 13:38.900
IS IT BAD ?

13:38.933 --> 13:41.333
DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE.

13:41.367 --> 13:42.833
HURRY UP.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.067
HI, JEFF GREENE, I'M A PATIENT
OF DR. MORRISON'S.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.067
I CALLED ABOUT
LARRY DAVID.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.367
OH YEAH.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.833
JUST SIGN IN AND THE DOCTOR
WILL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.500
OH.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.233
WELL, DO I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO PUT MY NAME ON THIS THING ?

13:59.267 --> 13:59.867
YES.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.367
YEAH.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.233
I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO PUT MY
NAME ON THESE LISTS, YOU KNOW.

14:04.267 --> 14:05.867
PEOPLE COME IN,
THEY SEE YOUR NAME.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.500
JUST, JUST SIGN IN.

14:07.533 --> 14:08.900
JUST SIGN IN.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.700
I DON'T LIKE HAVING
MY NAME ON THESE LISTS.

14:10.733 --> 14:11.700
THEN SIGN BEN VEREEN.

14:11.733 --> 14:14.067
WHO CARES WHAT
YOU SIGN, COME ON.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.933
YOUR HEAD'S BLEEDING,
JUST SIGN IN !

14:15.967 --> 14:16.867
AH.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.367

14:39.600 --> 14:41.533
( cellphone ringing )

14:41.567 --> 14:43.833
HELLO.

14:43.867 --> 14:44.933
DUDE.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.167
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.567
What ?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.500
WHAT ARE YOU CALLING ME
ON THE DOCTOR'S PHONE FOR ?

14:49.533 --> 14:51.500
I'M BORED
TO DEATH IN HERE.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.533
DON'T USE THE DOCTOR'S PHONE,
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

14:53.567 --> 14:54.967
Why, what's
the big deal ?

14:55.067 --> 14:56.100
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.733
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D GIVE YOU A CALL,

14:57.767 --> 14:59.333
SEE WHAT'S UP,
HOW YOU'RE DOING ?

14:59.367 --> 15:00.267
What are you reading ?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.800
"MEN'S FITNESS."

15:01.833 --> 15:02.900
"Men's Fitness" ?

15:02.933 --> 15:06.400
YEAH, ABOUT AMERICA'S
FATTEST CITIES.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.800
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THERE'S THE DOCTOR.

15:08.833 --> 15:09.933
ALRIGHT, I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.333
I WILL, UH,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.700
THAT WAS JEFF.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.467
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO USE THAT PHONE.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.500
SORRY.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.267
IT WAS A LOCAL CALL.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.067
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO USE THE PHONE.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.433
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT WAS
A LOCAL OR A LONG DISTANCE CALL.

15:29.467 --> 15:32.067
WE JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE
USING THAT PHONE, OKAY.

15:32.067 --> 15:36.933
FINE, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
THOUGH, UH, IF I MAY ASK.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.133
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?

15:38.167 --> 15:39.600
THERE IS NO PROBLEM.

15:39.633 --> 15:43.067
WE JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE
USING THAT PHONE.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.433
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY NOT THOUGH.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.400
WHY COULDN'T
I USE IT ?

15:47.433 --> 15:50.367
WELL, YOU COULD USE IT,
YOU OBVIOUSLY DID.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.833
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO USE IT THOUGH.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.100
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
I JUST DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND THE RULE.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.867
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.633
THE HISTORY OF HOW
WE ARRIVED AT THAT

15:57.667 --> 16:00.133
IS SO COMPLEX THAT I WON'T
EVEN BORE YOU WITH IT.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.900
JUST LET IT BE SAID THAT
WE DON'T ALLOW ANYONE TO USE

16:03.933 --> 16:05.733
THE PHONES IN
THE EXAMINATION ROOMS.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.133
YEAH, I MEAN, I JUST DON'T
SEE HOW IT'S HURTING ANYBODY.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.600
IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT
HURTING ANYBODY.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.700
WE JUST HAVE A RULE HERE, YOU
DON'T USE THE DOCTOR'S PHONE.

16:11.733 --> 16:12.867
IT'S SIMPLE.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.800
YEAH, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE REASON IS.

16:14.833 --> 16:17.067
I MEAN, YOU'RE SAYING NOT TO USE
IT, BUT WHAT'S THE REASON ?

16:17.067 --> 16:19.100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
HAVE TO KNOW THE REASON.

16:19.133 --> 16:21.400
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DECIDED THAT.

16:21.433 --> 16:22.967
IT SEEMS VERY
CAPRICIOUS TO ME.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.533
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD
TO MAKE A RULE

16:25.567 --> 16:27.600
THAT TAKES IN ALL
THE CONTINGENCIES.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.567
SO WE JUST HAVE A RULE
DON'T USE THE PHONE.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.567
OKAY.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.800
UNDERSTOOD.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.533
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND IT.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.067
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU ?

16:36.067 --> 16:37.067
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.600
I GOT HIT BY A DOOR.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.500
WOW, SIT DOWN,
WILL YOU ?

16:40.533 --> 16:43.500
MEL BROOKS IS COMING
OUT OF A BATHROOM AND HE,

16:43.533 --> 16:45.400
A SWINGING DOOR HIT ME.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.067
YEAH, MEL BROOKS, HUH ?

16:47.100 --> 16:48.067
YEAH.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.433
YEAH, IS IT
THE MEL BROOKS ?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.567
THE FUNNY GUY, YEAH.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.067
I LIKE MEL BROOKS,
I'M A BIG FAN OF HIS.

16:52.067 --> 16:52.967
LAY DOWN, WILL YOU ?

16:53.067 --> 16:53.833
YEAH, HE'S GREAT.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.567
PUT YOUR HEAD
ON THE PILLOW.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.733
YEAH, I HAVE TICKETS
FOR HIS PLAY "THE PRODUCERS".

16:57.767 --> 16:58.467
OH REALLY ?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.367
YEAH.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.067
OH YEAH,
I HEAR IT'S GREAT.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.067
SO DO I.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.300
BOY THIS IS, UH,
KIND OF A NASTY CUT.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.700
ALRIGHT, I THINK ALL WE HAVE
TO DO HERE IS CLEAN THIS UP

17:06.733 --> 17:08.333
AND, UH, PUT IN
A FEW STITCHES.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.067
OH REALLY ?

17:09.067 --> 17:09.500
MM-HMM.

17:09.533 --> 17:10.800
OH, OKAY.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.067
AGAIN I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE, UH, THE PHONE STUFF.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.067
OH, IT'S OKAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.100
JUST, UM, IF YOU'RE EVER
IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AGAIN,

17:18.133 --> 17:19.433
DON'T USE THE PHONE.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.300
YEAH, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
AN ODD POLICY TO ME THOUGH.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.067
MM-HMM, IT'S A RULE
THAT IS PRETTY UNIVERSAL

17:25.067 --> 17:26.367
IN EXAMINATION ROOMS,
YOU DON'T USE THE PHONE.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.833
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

17:27.867 --> 17:28.933
IT'S JUST THAT THE RULE DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE, THAT'S ALL.

17:28.967 --> 17:30.633
WELL, IT MAKES
SENSE TO US.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.067
OKAY, FINE.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.700
WE DON'T HAVE MANY RULES HERE,
THAT'S ONE OF THEM.

17:33.733 --> 17:35.467
IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD THOUGH
THAT IF YOU'RE MAKING

17:35.500 --> 17:38.733
A LOCAL CALL THAT ANYBODY
WOULD CARE, BUT WHATEVER.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.667
WELL, IT'S NOT THE EXPENSE OF
THE CALL WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.467
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
EVER HAD STITCHES BEFORE,

17:43.500 --> 17:45.567
BUT THERE IS A SLIGHT
BIT OF PAIN INVOLVED.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.833
NOTHING MORE I WOULD SAY
REALLY THAN A LITTLE PRICK.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.967
MM-HMM.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.700
YEAH, IT IS DEFINITELY
A PRICK INVOLVED.

17:50.733 --> 17:52.567
UH, YES, THERE IS
A PRICK INVOLVED.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.467
YEAH, THERE'S
ONE PRICK INVOLVED.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.733
YEAH, I WOULD SAY THERE
IS ONE PRICK INVOLVED.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.667
I AGREE, I'M NOT A DOCTOR,
BUT I AGREE THERE IS ONE PRICK.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.300
YEP.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.433
AND THE MORE I LOOK AT THIS
I THINK THIS IS PRETTY MINOR.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.933
OH OH,
WHAT THE HELL ?

18:16.967 --> 18:20.867
YOU DROOLED ON ME !

18:29.867 --> 18:33.400
SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYBODY FOR THE
10th ANNIVERSARY PRESENT ?

18:33.433 --> 18:36.967
I HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

18:37.067 --> 18:37.800
AND ?

18:37.833 --> 18:41.933
YOU KNOW,
I GOT THREE MONTHS.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.900
I'M GONNA
TAKE MY TIME

18:44.933 --> 18:47.533
AND WAIT, WAIT FOR
THE RIGHT ONE.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.100
AND YOU, MY FAT FRIEND,
WILL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.833
ALRIGHT, GOOD,
I SHOULD BE.

18:51.867 --> 18:53.700
MY BIG FAT FRIEND.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.333
( laughing )
MM, FATSO.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.633
YEAH, FATSO.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.333
OH, HEY.

19:03.367 --> 19:06.467
DID YOU GET
YOUR WALLET ?

19:06.500 --> 19:09.933
YEAH, HOW DID YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT ?

19:09.967 --> 19:11.300
I FOUND IT.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.300
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE
THE GUY FROM THE CAR.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.333
YEAH.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.933
JOANNE GAVE IT TO ME
IN MEL BROOKS' OFFICE.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.833
YEAH RIGHT, RIGHT,
I GAVE IT TO HER.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.600
THAT'S NOT
WHAT SHE SAID.

19:21.633 --> 19:24.667
WAIT A SECOND, SHE SAID
SHE FOUND THAT WALLET ?

19:24.700 --> 19:25.933
YES.

19:25.967 --> 19:27.767
THAT'S AN EXACT QUOTE,
"I FOUND THIS" ?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.433
SHE SAID SHE FOUND THE WALLET
AND SHE GAVE IT TO ME

19:29.467 --> 19:30.800
AND I GAVE HER
100 BUCKS.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.067
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SERIOUSLY YOU
SHOULD WORRY A LITTLE BIT LESS

19:33.067 --> 19:35.833
ABOUT THE WALLET AND MAYBE
MAINTAIN A LITTLE FOCUS

19:35.867 --> 19:37.567
ON YOUR DRIVING SKILLS, BUDDY.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.067
HELLO.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.967

LARRY DAVID TO SEE MEL.

19:43.067 --> 19:47.367

19:47.400 --> 19:52.533
YOU KNOW, I RAN INTO THE GUY
IN THE WHEELCHAIR DOWNSTAIRS,

19:52.567 --> 19:53.933
YOUR FRIEND, DENNIS.

19:53.967 --> 19:56.567
HE TOLD ME THAT YOU SAID
THAT YOU FOUND THE WALLET ?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.867
AND HE GAVE YOU
$100 REWARD ?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.067
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT ?

20:00.067 --> 20:01.767
HOW DARE YOU

20:07.000 --> 20:09.467
OH, YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH OUR LIFESTYLE

20:09.500 --> 20:10.667
THAT WE WANT
TO ADOPT A BABY ?

20:10.700 --> 20:11.833
NO, NOT AT ALL.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.600
YEAH. YOU NEED A GOOD
FUCKIN' ASS KICKING.

20:13.633 --> 20:14.800
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED !

20:14.833 --> 20:16.400
YOU WANT TO NAME
OUR BABY TANG ?!

20:16.433 --> 20:19.167
YOU THINK IT'S GOOD TO NAME
A KID AFTER A BREAKFAST DRINK ?!

20:19.200 --> 20:20.667
WE DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD NAME !

20:20.700 --> 20:22.100
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?!

20:22.133 --> 20:23.333
I UNDERSTAND.

20:23.367 --> 20:24.967

20:25.000 --> 20:27.033

20:27.067 --> 20:30.067
I'M SORRY,
OKAY, SORRY, SORRY.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.333
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY ?

20:31.367 --> 20:33.000
I GOT A MEETING
WITH MEL BROOKS.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.767
WELL, YOU'RE HERE.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.333
YOU CAME.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.900
YES.

20:41.933 --> 20:46.400
AND I GUESS YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I CALLED YOU.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.300
KIND OF, YEAH.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.100
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE OTHER NIGHT

20:51.133 --> 20:54.700
I SANG AT THE KARAOKE CLUB
AND THEN YOU GOT UP ?

20:54.733 --> 20:55.733
YEAH, HE WAS GREAT.

20:55.767 --> 20:59.033
AND THE AUDIENCE WENT
PRETTY WILD FOR ME.

20:59.067 --> 21:04.100
AND THEN YOU SANG "SWANNEE"
AND THEY WENT CRAZY.

21:04.133 --> 21:08.200
AND WHEN YOU SANG
I WAS ABSOLUTELY FLOORED.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.967
I MEAN, I,
YOU THINK I--

21:11.067 --> 21:11.800
( laughing )
REALLY ?

21:11.833 --> 21:13.267
NO, NO, I COULDN'T
GET OVER IT.

21:13.300 --> 21:18.367
AND BANG, BANG
SOMETHING WENT OFF IN ME.

21:18.400 --> 21:23.067
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
THE GUY PLAYING MAX BIALYSTOCK

21:23.100 --> 21:25.133
WILL BE GOING OUT
ON THE ROAD

21:25.167 --> 21:29.167
LEAVING AN EMPTY SLOT
CALLED MAX BIALYSTOCK,

21:29.200 --> 21:32.300
THE LEADING CHARACTER
IN "THE PRODUCERS".

21:32.333 --> 21:34.967
I WANT YOU, LARRY DAVID,

21:35.067 --> 21:39.300
TO BE THE NEXT
MAX BIALYSTOCK ON BROADWAY.

21:39.333 --> 21:44.567
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PLAY
THE LEAD IN "THE PRODUCERS".

21:44.600 --> 21:47.467
AND WHEN THIS THING GOES OFF
I'M NEVER WRONG.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.400
THE GUY...

21:48.433 --> 21:52.200

21:52.233 --> 21:55.133

21:58.367 --> 21:59.533
BUT NO, I MEAN,

21:59.567 --> 22:02.767
I'M NOT, LIKE
A THEATER ACTOR, UH...

22:02.800 --> 22:05.600
WHEN WE MADE THE MOVIE OF
"THE PRODUCERS", THE GUY THAT

22:05.633 --> 22:09.267
PLAYED CARMEN GIYA WAS THIS
INCREDIBLE TALENTED GREEK ACTOR.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.233
HIS NAME IS ANDREAS,
ANDREAS VOUTSINAS.

22:12.267 --> 22:14.500
AND ANDREAS USED
TO SAY TO ME...

22:14.533 --> 22:17.767
"OR YOU GOT IT
OR YOU AIN'T."

22:17.800 --> 22:20.267
I SAID, ANDREAS, YOU CAN'T
START A SENTENCE WITH "OR".

22:20.300 --> 22:22.067
HE SAID NEVER MIND.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.133
"OR YOU GOT IT
OR YOU AIN'T."

22:24.167 --> 22:25.600
YOU GOT IT, LARRY.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.133
YOU GOT IT, LARRY.

22:27.167 --> 22:28.300
YOU GOT IT, MISTER.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.867
MR. BROOKS IS RIGHT,
MY FRIEND, YOU GOT IT.

22:30.900 --> 22:34.500
OH, BY THE WAY BEN STILLER WILL
BE TAKING OVER AT THE SAME TIME.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.433
SO IT WILL BE LARRY DAVID
AND BEN STILLER.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.100
I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.200
GO TO THE SHOW TONIGHT,
SEE THE SHOW.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.900
LET IT GET INTO YOU PORES,
LET IT GET INTO YOUR SYSTEM.

22:43.933 --> 22:45.767
I'M TELLING YOU
I'M NEVER WRONG.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.700
I AM NEVER WRONG.

22:46.733 --> 22:47.900
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
CRAZY TO YOU.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.100
I KNOW IT SOUNDS INSANE.

22:49.133 --> 22:50.600
IT DOESN'T SOUND
CRAZY TO ME.

22:50.633 --> 22:51.767
YOU WERE BORN
TO DO IT.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.600
YOU KNOW WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE ?

22:52.633 --> 22:53.633
IT SOUNDS
LIKE A JOKE.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.433
IT SOUND LIKE ALLAN FUNT
OR JAMIE KENNEDY'S

22:56.467 --> 22:57.800
GONNA COME WALKING
THROUGH THE DOOR.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.167

GOOD TO MEET YOU.

23:13.833 --> 23:14.967

HIGH SCHOOL, I SWEAR TO GOD.

23:17.633 --> 23:19.533

26:31.800 --> 26:32.600
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.233
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SHAKE HIS HAND ?

26:34.267 --> 26:35.600
HE PUT HIS
HAND OUT FOR YOU.

26:35.633 --> 26:37.467
HE SNEEZED
ALL OVER HIS HAND.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.300
BUT HE JUST
SNEEZED ON IT.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.767
HOW RUDE IS THAT ?

26:39.800 --> 26:42.067
HE DIDN'T
NOTICE ANYTHING.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.833
HE PUT HIS HAND OUT
FOR YOU TO SHAKE IT.

26:44.867 --> 26:47.067
OF COURSE HE NOTICED THAT,
EVERYONE NOTICED THAT.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.333
I'M NOT GOING
TO SHAKE HIS HAND.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.533
ITS GOT SNOT ALL
OVER IT, COME ON.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.733
PARTNERS LEO
ALL THE WAY.

26:52.767 --> 26:56.067
AND NOTHING OR NO ONE
WILL EVER COME BETWEEN US.

26:56.067 --> 26:57.500
NOTHING OR NO ONE, MAX.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.367
( knocking )

26:58.400 --> 26:59.467
COME IN.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.633
( applause )

27:06.167 --> 27:09.867
I'M BACK DOWN
FROM THE PILLS.

27:09.900 --> 27:16.100
OH, ABOUT OUR 10th ANNIVERSARY
PRESENT, IT'S...

27:16.133 --> 27:18.533
ALRIGHT, IT'S FINE IF YOU
WANT TO GET OUT OF IT.

27:18.567 --> 27:19.667
NO.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.567
BELIEVE ME I WILL NOT
THINK ANY LESS OF YOU.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.100
NO, I DON'T WANT TO GET
OUT OF IT, A DEAL'S A DEAL.

27:24.133 --> 27:27.467
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
THERE'S A FEW GROUND RULES

27:27.500 --> 27:30.367
THAT WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT, OKAY.

27:30.400 --> 27:35.067
OKAY, RULE NUMBER ONE IS
IT'S A ONE TIME ONLY.

27:35.067 --> 27:37.700
OKAY, ONE TIME ONLY.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.433
AND THERE'S A DEADLINE.

27:39.467 --> 27:42.700
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY AT MIDNIGHT
AND THEN IT'S OVER.

27:42.733 --> 27:45.267
YEAH, KIND OF LIKE
CINDERELLA.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.067
AND BY THE WAY...

27:47.067 --> 27:48.067
YEAH.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.933
YOU KNOW IF I DO
THIS SHOW ON BROADWAY ?

27:49.967 --> 27:51.167
YEAH.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.733
MY OPENING NIGHT IS THE SAME
NIGHT AS OUR ANNIVERSARY.

27:53.767 --> 27:54.367

27:54.400 --> 27:55.933
THAT WOULD BE FUN.

27:55.967 --> 28:01.300

FLAUNT IT *

28:01.333 --> 28:07.067

28:09.633 --> 28:12.267
* STICK YOUR CHEST OUT,
SHAKE YOUR TUSH *

28:12.300 --> 28:16.067
YOU KNOW MAYBE I WILL.

28:16.967 --> 28:18.967
