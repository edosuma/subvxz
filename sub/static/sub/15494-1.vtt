The honorable Allen D.
and the former Mrs. Eastern.

01:17.856 --> 01:20.723
The honorable
William and Mrs. Breslow.

01:21.940 --> 01:25.620
The honorable Nelson
and Mrs. Winnie Mandela.

01:26.798 --> 01:32.236
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States and Mrs. Bush.

01:35.106 --> 01:39.338
Here's everybody on the list, Barb.
Everybody's here.

01:39.544 --> 01:42.980
Hi, Peter. They let you
out of the office early today.

01:43.181 --> 01:45.672
Jack, glad you could make it.

01:45.917 --> 01:49.512
Hi. Get rid of the beard.
I don't like that, too liberal.

01:49.721 --> 01:52.155
Hi, Frank. Trudy.

01:54.125 --> 01:57.094
Hi, Peter. Glad you could make it.
I like your suit.

01:58.263 --> 02:00.356
Everybody's here.
Commissioner.

02:00.565 --> 02:05.002
Thank you very much. Dr. Meinheimer,
I'm glad you could make it.

02:05.203 --> 02:07.671
I'm looking forward to
hearing your speech.

02:07.872 --> 02:12.775
I'm sure it's a wonderful,
well thought-out piece of work.

02:14.479 --> 02:17.073
Ah, here she is. Dear.

02:18.516 --> 02:21.349
Have you met Dr. Meinheimer formally?

02:23.254 --> 02:25.051
Thank you.

02:25.256 --> 02:28.692
Great Lady down!
Repeat, Great Lady down!

02:28.893 --> 02:32.056
- What happened?
- Easy, watch the table!

02:32.230 --> 02:33.230
Wait.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.827
- How are you, dear?
- I'm OK, I'm fine.

02:40.772 --> 02:44.037
Good. Please be seated.

02:44.242 --> 02:46.210
Welcome. I'm glad you could all come.

02:47.350 --> 02:51.753
I'm pleased that we have so many
distinguished guests tonight.

02:51.955 --> 02:54.389
This week we are celebrating

02:54.591 --> 02:57.788
Law Enforcement Week
all across the country.

02:57.994 --> 03:00.861
So I'd like to turn the proceedings over

03:01.064 --> 03:03.464
to our own
Washington DC Police Commissioner,

03:03.633 --> 03:07.660
Captain Annabelle Brumford.

03:07.871 --> 03:11.329
I would like to introduce
a most distinguished American.

03:11.541 --> 03:17.104
This week he is being honored
for his 1,000th drug dealer killed.

03:17.313 --> 03:22.615
Please welcome Lieutenant
Frank Drebin of Police Squad.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.755
In all honesty,
the last two I backed over with my car.

03:29.025 --> 03:31.550
Luckily, they were drug dealers.

03:31.761 --> 03:34.161
- Good.
- Excellent!

03:36.065 --> 03:38.659
Thank you, Commissioner Brumford.

03:38.868 --> 03:42.770
Now I'd like to call on my Chief of Staff,
Mr. John Sununu,

03:42.972 --> 03:45.304
to introduce some special guests.

03:45.508 --> 03:49.808
Thank you. Mr. President, tonight I'm
extremely proud to welcome

03:50.013 --> 03:53.039
our guests
from the nation's energy suppliers.

03:53.283 --> 03:55.274
First, representing the oil industry,

03:55.518 --> 03:59.921
head of the Society of Petroleum Industry
Leaders, better known as SPIL,

04:00.156 --> 04:01.953
Mr. Terence Baggett.

04:03.226 --> 04:07.492
From the coal industry, Chairman of
the Society for More Coal Energy,

04:07.697 --> 04:10.564
or SMOKE,
Mr. Donald Fenzwick.

04:10.733 --> 04:11.927
Thank you.

04:12.135 --> 04:13.966
From the nuclear industry,

04:14.170 --> 04:18.129
President of the Key Atomic
Benefits Office Of Mankind, KABOOM,

04:19.341 --> 04:21.242
Mr. Arthur Dunwell.

04:21.444 --> 04:23.912
As you know, for the past three years,

04:24.147 --> 04:27.878
this administration has been trying to
formulate a National Energy Policy

04:28.117 --> 04:31.211
that will have a lasting impact
on the way we live

04:31.454 --> 04:33.888
for the next decade and beyond.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.684
To make sure
that we choose the right path,

04:36.893 --> 04:41.956
the President has appointed
as his top advisor in this area,

04:42.165 --> 04:44.633
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

04:49.038 --> 04:53.168
As I'm sure you're aware,
his reputation in this field is without peer,

04:53.376 --> 04:56.641
and Dr. Meinheimer
will present his recommendations

04:56.846 --> 05:00.612
to the Annual National Press Club
Dinner this Tuesday evening.

05:05.021 --> 05:06.454
Mr. President.

05:09.659 --> 05:13.720
I want all of you here
to be the first to know

05:13.930 --> 05:19.368
that I've decided to base my
administration's entire energy policy

05:19.535 --> 05:22.129
on Dr. Meinheimer's recommendations.

05:23.206 --> 05:27.666
This issue is too important to be left to
politicians or special interests to decide.

05:27.877 --> 05:32.576
We need an independent and informed
source on which to base future actions,

05:32.782 --> 05:36.843
and Dr. Meinheimer
is the recognized expert in this field.

05:37.086 --> 05:41.887
Mr. President, if I may say so,

05:42.091 --> 05:46.118
I do hope that Dr. Meinheimer
won't be influenced...

05:47.764 --> 05:51.256
...influenced by any of the so-called
environmental groups.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.267
Well, we're all aware of
Dr. Meinheimer's reputation.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.236
He is best qualified
to explain his research methods.

06:00.310 --> 06:02.608
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Great Lady down again.

07:50.253 --> 07:53.188
This happens every fucking time
when I go shopping!

08:39.135 --> 08:42.332
- Jane...
- Dr. Meinheimer.

08:43.172 --> 08:47.233
- You're back early.
- And you're here late.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.502
Surely, a lovely woman like you

08:49.712 --> 08:53.375
can think of something better to do
on a Saturday night?

08:53.616 --> 08:57.416
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so blunt.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.389
It's all right, Doctor. It's OK.

09:02.558 --> 09:06.654
You're thinking about him again,
aren't you? What was his name?

09:06.863 --> 09:09.457
- Frank?
- Yes.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.862
You just can't forget about him?

09:12.068 --> 09:14.559
- Who?
- Frank.

09:15.404 --> 09:16.598
Oh, yes!

09:16.806 --> 09:20.401
No, I can't. I... I try.

09:20.610 --> 09:25.013
It's just that when you've had
that much man...

09:26.749 --> 09:29.877
But then, you wouldn't understand.

09:32.088 --> 09:36.218
Jane, you mustn't be
so hard on yourself.

09:36.425 --> 09:39.588
You've done a wonderful job
here at the Institute.

09:39.795 --> 09:43.094
You're the finest Director of
Public Relations we've ever had.

09:43.266 --> 09:46.167
Thank you, Doctor, I try my best.

09:46.769 --> 09:50.296
But I see you here
night after night past ten.

09:50.506 --> 09:56.308
You must forget about the past.
Go out, see new people, enjoy yourself.

09:56.512 --> 09:59.003
There is someone I'm seeing,
in fact just yesterday.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.775
I was telling him about the speech...

10:02.018 --> 10:05.283
- Good evening.
- Hello, Norm.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.290
I forgot.
How was the White House dinner?

10:09.525 --> 10:14.292
Extraordinary. The President promised
to implement my recommendations.

10:14.497 --> 10:17.466
Wonderful! Then you're going to deliver
the speech you told me about?

10:18.634 --> 10:21.296
Every word of it.
I would've given it tonight,

10:21.504 --> 10:25.031
but a guest there made such a ruckus
that they wouldn't have heard me.

10:25.675 --> 10:29.509
Hey, Al! Ken!
Look at this.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.340
I found this in the waste-basket.

10:34.483 --> 10:37.884
Hey, that's a pretty nice clock!

10:38.120 --> 10:41.055
I wonder why they threw it out.

10:41.290 --> 10:45.886
It's probably because it's
four minutes too slow. Let me fix it.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.329
There.

10:54.170 --> 10:57.731
<i>My name is Sergeant Frank Drebin,</i>
<i>Detective Lieutenant, Police Squad.</i>

10:57.940 --> 11:02.468
<i>I was getting my car washed when</i>
<i>I heard the call come over the scanner.</i>

11:02.678 --> 11:06.705
<i>There had been a bombing and I was</i>
<i>on my way to advise the DC Police</i>

11:06.949 --> 11:10.715
<i>as part of the President's</i>
<i>"Operation Scum Roundup".</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:13.980
- Ready?
- Yeah, got it.

11:14.223 --> 11:17.715
<i>As far as police work is concerned,</i>
<i>once in a while something comes up</i>

11:17.927 --> 11:20.555
<i>that nothing quite prepares you for.</i>

11:20.763 --> 11:24.665
<i>Somehow, a demented madman,</i>
<i>probably full of self-hate,</i>

11:24.834 --> 11:29.771
<i>and possibly a couple of months</i>
<i>behind in his rent, finally snapped.</i>

11:31.807 --> 11:35.140
- I'm glad you could make it.
- I got here as quickly as I could.

11:35.344 --> 11:38.074
Congratulations, I understand
that Edna's pregnant again.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.908
- Yes, and if I catch the guy who did it...
- Captain.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.950
They've searched the building.
No sign of a break-in, no money missing.

11:45.154 --> 11:47.588
This was one hell of an explosion.

11:47.823 --> 11:50.291
We're still trying to figure out
what they used.

11:50.526 --> 11:53.586
- Any other victims?
- You're standing on one right now.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.060
- Oh, I see...
- Get him out of here.

11:56.232 --> 12:02.034
- This one's a real mess.
- Over here, Frank found another one.

12:02.238 --> 12:05.969
- Any witnesses, Ed?
- Well, there's one. A woman.

12:06.175 --> 12:09.008
She saw a man leaving
just before the explosion.

12:09.211 --> 12:13.011
- We should let Nordberg handle it.
- No, I'd better do it while it's still fresh.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.683
Not now. She fainted dead away.

12:15.885 --> 12:19.252
She took a knock on the head.
She looks pretty bad.

12:19.455 --> 12:21.286
- I'll handle it.
- Sir...

12:21.490 --> 12:25.927
- Miss, I'd like to ask some questions.
- Not that bad.

12:26.128 --> 12:29.359
She's being questioned
by our sketch artist.

12:33.602 --> 12:36.867
<i>I couldn't believe it was her.</i>
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

12:37.073 --> 12:40.804
<i>But there she was,</i>
<i>just like I remembered her.</i>

12:41.010 --> 12:43.911
<i>That delicately beautiful face...</i>

12:44.747 --> 12:49.844
<i>... and a body that could melt a</i>
<i>cheese sandwich from across the room.</i>

12:50.086 --> 12:54.489
<i>And breasts that seem to say,</i>
<i>"Hey, look at these!"</i>

12:58.094 --> 13:00.562
<i>She made you drop to your knees</i>

13:00.763 --> 13:05.200
<i>and thank God</i>
<i>that you were a man. Yeah...</i>

13:05.367 --> 13:10.031
<i>She reminded me of my mother,</i>
<i>all right. No doubt about it.</i>

13:11.273 --> 13:16.040
Snap out of it. You're looking at her
like she was your mother.

13:23.853 --> 13:29.382
- Frank.
- Jane. I didn't know you lived here.

13:29.592 --> 13:32.186
I moved here two years ago.

13:33.629 --> 13:37.065
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any children.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.962
Yes, of course.

13:39.168 --> 13:42.660
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine. As good as new.

13:42.872 --> 13:45.204
In fact, better than ever.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.136
Look, Frank...

13:47.343 --> 13:51.575
I know it's awkward, but you're not still
obsessed with our relationship, are you?

13:51.781 --> 13:54.113
Obsessed? Who's obsessed?

13:54.350 --> 13:57.683
Because you backed out of the wedding
two years ago? I'd forgotten.

13:57.887 --> 14:00.528
Ancient history,
like the Democratic Party.

14:00.762 --> 14:03.757
He was in tears.
In church, crying like a baby.

14:03.959 --> 14:06.484
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I had to return 13 Cuisinarts.

14:06.695 --> 14:09.220
- That's enough.
- I kept the salad shooter, though.

14:09.398 --> 14:12.697
Jane, there you are. Hello, Jane.

14:12.902 --> 14:16.565
Dr. Meinheimer.
Frank, this is Dr. Albert Meinheimer.

14:16.772 --> 14:20.105
- Don't get up. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

14:20.309 --> 14:23.073
I believe we met
at the White House dinner.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.737
He never forgets a face.
He has a photographic memory.

14:26.949 --> 14:31.010
It's a terrible thing that's happened.
I hope you find the people responsible.

14:31.253 --> 14:35.349
I'm sorry I can't be more optimistic,
but we have a long road ahead of us.

14:35.558 --> 14:40.052
It's like sex, a painstaking task
that seems to go on and on forever,

14:40.262 --> 14:43.754
and when you think that things are
going your way, nothing happens.

14:43.933 --> 14:48.370
Jane, about this man
you saw last night... Anything can help.

14:48.571 --> 14:51.631
I gave the sketch artist a description.

14:55.010 --> 14:58.776
Eh... Ed!
That'll be all, McTigue.

15:01.116 --> 15:05.314
We should get that other artist. The one
that never dates and lives with two guys.

15:05.554 --> 15:07.146
Right. Sorenson!

15:07.389 --> 15:11.291
I'd like to see the rest of the Institute,
if you don't mind?

15:11.493 --> 15:14.018
Of course.
We should start with the research area.

15:14.230 --> 15:17.290
That's a good idea. It's right this way.

15:19.101 --> 15:22.161
What can you tell me
about the man you saw last night?

15:22.371 --> 15:24.362
- He's Caucasian.
- Caucasian?

15:24.573 --> 15:28.805
Yeah. You know, white guy.
With a moustache, about 6 foot 3.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.639
An awfully big moustache.
What's this all about?

15:31.847 --> 15:34.179
This is our research laboratory.

15:34.416 --> 15:39.319
Experiments are temperature-controlled
by the machinery below.

15:39.521 --> 15:44.185
Our scientists have spent years on them
and are just now making breakthroughs.

15:44.393 --> 15:46.725
Today, we'll join two compounds...

15:51.333 --> 15:52.766
Oh, my God!

15:52.968 --> 15:56.335
Thank heavens the bomb
didn't damage the research area.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.803
Yes, but I can't understand
who'd do such a thing.

16:00.009 --> 16:02.569
Jane, I think you
ought to know something.

16:02.778 --> 16:05.144
- Jane, darling!
- Quentin!

16:05.347 --> 16:09.340
Jane, are you all right?
I was so worried about you.

16:09.585 --> 16:13.021
I'm really OK, but I'm glad you're here.

16:14.590 --> 16:18.617
I'm sorry! Frank, this is Quentin
Hapsburg of the Hexagon Oil Company.

16:18.827 --> 16:22.319
- Pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Drebin. Frank Drebin.

16:22.531 --> 16:25.728
I believe I've used
some of your restrooms.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.563
I'm... sure you have.

16:28.771 --> 16:32.537
- Are you connected with the Institute?
- Not officially.

16:32.741 --> 16:36.233
But Jane and I have seen
quite a lot of each other lately.

16:36.445 --> 16:38.709
How is my little hell-cat?

16:40.716 --> 16:44.812
Well, that's great. I've been dating, too.
Nice girl, an author.

16:45.054 --> 16:48.285
Wrote the book on male sexual
dysfunction. You've probably read it.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.617
- I beg your pardon?
- Please...

16:50.826 --> 16:53.260
I'm sure we can
handle the situation maturely,

16:53.462 --> 16:55.930
just like the responsible adults
that we are.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.931
Isn't that right, Mr. Poopy Pants?

16:59.134 --> 17:00.829
- That does it!
- Frank!

17:01.036 --> 17:03.869
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us.

17:04.073 --> 17:07.201
Anything you wish, my darling.

17:08.176 --> 17:10.667
Until tonight, then...

17:29.665 --> 17:34.265
<i>I'm feeling blue</i>

17:37.506 --> 17:42.906
<i>Just thinking of you</i>

17:43.712 --> 17:48.031
<i>I get out of bed</i>

17:48.131 --> 17:52.250
<i>Wish I was dead</i>

17:54.289 --> 18:00.089
<i>And I hope you do, too</i>

18:00.796 --> 18:08.134
<i>So I've given up</i>
<i>I've thrown in the towel</i>

18:09.138 --> 18:11.698
<i>I've taken all the pills</i>

18:11.907 --> 18:16.907
<i>The law will allow</i>

18:17.646 --> 18:20.843
<i>And so I'm feeling blue</i>

18:21.083 --> 18:25.986
- Sir?
- Give me the strongest thing you've got.

18:30.459 --> 18:34.327
- On second thoughts, a Black Russian.
- Very well, sir.

18:34.530 --> 18:39.130
<i>I guess I'm just</i>

18:39.868 --> 18:42.668
<i>Screwed</i>

18:45.240 --> 18:47.936
Frank. I thought I'd find you here.

18:48.143 --> 18:51.635
Ed, sit down.
Pull up a memory or two.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.680
You left before I could talk to you.

18:54.917 --> 19:00.446
Is it just my imagination
or is the whole world crazy?

19:00.689 --> 19:04.056
No, it's just a small percentage
of the population, Frank.

19:04.259 --> 19:10.664
I hope you're right. It's just that
I don't know if I fit in any more.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.360
You're still thinking about Jane,
aren't you?

19:14.570 --> 19:18.438
She's part of my life, Ed. Always will be.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.700
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.

19:21.910 --> 19:26.506
When she said, "Get out of my life
forever," I knew it was over.

19:26.715 --> 19:29.650
Sometimes I think about you and Edna,
and I envy you,

19:29.852 --> 19:35.518
because you've had the same person
every day for over 30 years.

19:35.724 --> 19:39.023
You wake up with her,
eat with her, sleep with her...

19:39.228 --> 19:42.095
You make love to the same woman.

19:42.297 --> 19:47.132
You spend every possible
waking moment together,

19:47.302 --> 19:52.433
while I'm out with 20-year-olds who
just want to have fun and cheap sex.

19:52.641 --> 19:55.303
Girls who can't say no,
who can't get enough.

19:55.511 --> 20:00.107
"More, more, more! It's your turn now
to wear the handcuffs."

20:04.720 --> 20:07.621
I just want to love, Ed.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.073
I'm sure you'll find love.

20:10.173 --> 20:13.492
- I already have one.
- It's from the lady.

20:19.368 --> 20:23.270
Go to her, Frank. Go on!

20:24.206 --> 20:26.800
I'll see you in the morning.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.170
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

20:33.749 --> 20:34.943
Sorry.

20:37.286 --> 20:39.652
This isn't easy to say.

20:39.855 --> 20:42.790
I'm lonely, I'm lost.
I need someone to hold, to love.

20:43.025 --> 20:44.225
Frank!

20:46.061 --> 20:47.926
Over here.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.328
Well...

20:55.170 --> 20:58.333
- What are you doing here?
- I called your hotel, got no answer.

20:58.540 --> 21:02.499
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.

21:03.712 --> 21:08.149
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr. Drebin. Jane.

21:08.383 --> 21:11.477
Always nice to see nice people.

21:11.720 --> 21:16.157
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.

21:16.391 --> 21:18.391
Of course.

21:20.896 --> 21:25.731
<i>Ding dong, the witch is dead</i>
<i>Which old witch? The wicked witch...</i>

21:25.901 --> 21:30.770
Sam. That's enough.
Play the other one, please.

21:30.973 --> 21:33.965
You can't let old hurts die, can you?

21:34.176 --> 21:36.610
You walk out of my life,
no explanation...

21:36.812 --> 21:39.872
- Didn't you get the letters?
- Every one of them.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.812
I didn't open them.
I tore them up and threw them in the fire.

21:43.051 --> 21:48.045
So you didn't get the cheque for $75,000
that your uncle left you in his will?

21:48.290 --> 21:50.383
Why are you here?

21:50.592 --> 21:52.406
I remembered something
about the crime.

21:52.706 --> 21:56.198
Outside the window, I saw
a red van parked across the street.

21:56.765 --> 21:59.495
Red van?
Thank you, that'll be very helpful.

21:59.701 --> 22:02.169
You've said your piece,
you can go now, right?

22:02.371 --> 22:04.965
That's not my only reason
for being here.

22:05.173 --> 22:08.301
- I want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends...

22:08.510 --> 22:12.173
I bet if I dusted you for prints,
they'd be your lover Quentin's.

22:12.381 --> 22:13.381
You!

22:14.149 --> 22:17.209
I see a certain kitten
still knows how to scratch.

22:25.227 --> 22:28.287
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

22:31.199 --> 22:34.828
We're no good together.
All you ever lived for was police work.

22:35.037 --> 22:37.733
You were always busy
saving the "end zone" layer.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.534
Ozone layer!
Frank, you never tried to understand.

22:41.743 --> 22:43.870
How can you say that,

22:44.079 --> 22:48.379
when I sank every penny into buying
1,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.505
Then I had it slashed
so we could build our dream house.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.879
Frank! How could you be so insensitive?

22:54.122 --> 22:58.183
Insensitive? You think it's easy
displacing an entire tribe?

22:58.393 --> 23:03.092
- You try it sometime.
- I'd better go. This was a mistake.

23:03.265 --> 23:07.565
I don't know why I came here.
I was hoping that you'd have someone.

23:08.337 --> 23:11.966
I'm single. I love being single!

23:13.308 --> 23:17.745
I haven't had this much sex
since I was a boy scout leader!

23:20.716 --> 23:25.119
I mean, at the time,
I was dating a lot.

23:35.330 --> 23:39.824
- I told you the bombing wouldn't work.
- We had no choice.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.001
Look at this headline.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.731
"President to give Meinheimer
blank cheque at Press Club Dinner."

23:45.941 --> 23:48.068
That speech is in two days.

23:48.276 --> 23:51.109
- Don't you think I know that?
- We all know that.

23:51.313 --> 23:53.679
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

23:55.050 --> 23:58.383
I know that you're all worried,
and I agree.

23:58.587 --> 24:01.283
There's plenty to be worried about.

24:01.490 --> 24:07.326
Like this solar power plant, already
operational outside Los Angeles.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.622
Photovoltaic cells.

24:09.798 --> 24:13.734
They convert sunlight
directly into electricity.

24:13.935 --> 24:17.769
Fluorescents. Last ten times as long
as a conventional light-bulb.

24:17.973 --> 24:20.168
Uses only a quarter of the power.

24:20.375 --> 24:25.142
Superwindows. They insulate
as well as ten sheets of glass.

24:25.347 --> 24:30.284
An electric car,
partially powered by solar panels.

24:30.519 --> 24:33.249
But the truth is, gentlemen,

24:33.455 --> 24:36.891
that I'm not worried about
any of these things.

24:37.125 --> 24:41.494
Because no one is ever
going to know about them.

24:41.696 --> 24:45.723
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- He's going to tell the President.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.803
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?

24:51.840 --> 24:54.638
- That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!

24:54.843 --> 25:00.042
- What about his speech on Tuesday?
- Dr. Meinheimer will deliver his speech.

25:00.248 --> 25:05.914
It is my view that we must rely on
coal, oil and nuclear energy.

25:06.154 --> 25:08.588
<i>Our</i> Dr. Meinheimer.

25:08.824 --> 25:11.372
- Oh, my God!
- That's incredible!

25:11.472 --> 25:15.692
Meet Earl Hacker,
former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.

25:17.999 --> 25:23.835
As I explained to Mr. Hapsburg,
my fee is one million dollars,

25:24.039 --> 25:28.567
and, might I add,
I'm worth every penny of it.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.269
But you gentlemen
don't have any choice.

25:35.584 --> 25:36.984
Do you?

25:45.760 --> 25:50.288
<i>After a good night's sleep,</i>
<i>I headed back to police headquarters.</i>

25:50.465 --> 25:53.127
<i>I figured that if I buried myself</i>
<i>in police work,</i>

25:53.335 --> 25:56.327
<i>I could forget about Jane</i>
<i>and maybe in the process</i>

25:56.538 --> 25:58.938
<i>catch a vicious killer</i>
<i>before he struck again.</i>

25:59.140 --> 26:02.837
<i>So far we had few clues</i>
<i>and no real leads.</i>

26:03.044 --> 26:06.207
<i>I was hoping that the lab boys</i>
<i>had come up with something.</i>

26:06.414 --> 26:07.608
Shut it off!

26:07.849 --> 26:11.080
- Take it easy.
- Say your prayers.

26:12.888 --> 26:14.515
- Nice work.
- What?

26:14.723 --> 26:18.124
Can you show us the results
from the Research Institute?

26:18.326 --> 26:20.294
We weren't able to get
any clean fingerprints,

26:21.496 --> 26:24.624
but we did find footprints
outside the Institute.

26:24.799 --> 26:28.599
We made plaster casts of them.
A size 91/2 D.

26:28.803 --> 26:31.829
We're running a trace on it.
But more interesting...

26:32.040 --> 26:34.907
We also found this dinosaur footprint.

26:35.110 --> 26:39.137
- A major find from the Paleolithic era.
- Anything else?

26:39.347 --> 26:44.683
Yes, 20 feet down we discovered
ancient timbers from Noah's Ark.

26:44.886 --> 26:46.547
About the case...

26:46.788 --> 26:49.916
I'll be leaving for Boston tomorrow
where I'll deliver a major address

26:50.125 --> 26:54.619
to the American Archaeological Society.
And I'm booked on <i>Geraldo</i> next week.

26:54.829 --> 26:57.889
You're going on <i>Geraldo</i>
because of this?

26:58.066 --> 27:00.933
No, my wife is a transsexual
Satan worshipper.

27:01.136 --> 27:04.003
Meanwhile, we'll be continuing
fingerprint analysis,

27:04.205 --> 27:07.697
fiber checks,
DNA breakdown and hair samples.

27:07.909 --> 27:11.174
Then, using the microscopic dirt particles
on this footprint,

27:11.379 --> 27:14.439
we'll get a geological breakdown
of the entire city.

27:14.683 --> 27:18.585
- We may not have that kind of time.
- Then maybe this will help.

27:19.854 --> 27:23.483
We found this wallet
on the curb outside the Institute.

27:23.692 --> 27:28.891
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab.

27:29.064 --> 27:34.696
"Hector Savage". From Detroit.
I remember this pug.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.895
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.

27:38.106 --> 27:41.200
Yeah. He fought
under the name of Kid Minneapolis.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.469
I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once,
in Cincinnati.

27:44.679 --> 27:47.147
No, that's Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.

27:47.349 --> 27:50.512
He was killed in the ring in Houston
by Tex Colorado.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.687
- The Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.

27:53.888 --> 27:55.947
- Was it North or South?
- North.

27:56.191 --> 27:59.058
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.

27:59.194 --> 28:01.287
You sure know your boxing.

28:01.496 --> 28:03.464
All I know is:
never bet on the white guy.

28:04.633 --> 28:08.467
- You've got an address?
- The card says, "Monique De Carlo".

28:08.670 --> 28:11.298
"210 Bleckman Street."

28:11.506 --> 28:16.307
That's the red-light district. I wonder
why Savage is hanging out down there.

28:16.511 --> 28:18.445
Sex, Frank?

28:19.681 --> 28:23.617
No, not right now, Ed.
We've got work to do.

28:25.987 --> 28:31.015
<i>The address we had for De Carlo</i>
<i>was in the city's Little Italy.</i>

28:31.226 --> 28:35.629
<i>We went there, hoping it would</i>
<i>lead us to Hector Savage</i>

28:35.830 --> 28:39.891
<i>and lead us to a clue</i>
<i>that would break the case wide open.</i>

28:42.604 --> 28:45.266
That's the cops.
You've got to get rid of them.

28:45.473 --> 28:49.603
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, hide in the basement.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.405
You'll be safe down there.

28:54.249 --> 28:56.114
- Ed.
- Frank.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.978
- Red van.
- Yes, I know.

28:58.219 --> 29:02.519
Jane said that she saw a red van
outside the Institute before the explosion.

29:02.724 --> 29:05.989
- Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.

29:06.194 --> 29:09.027
- Bug the van. See where it goes.
- Good thinking.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.596
- Nordberg!
- No problem.

29:15.136 --> 29:18.970
Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
This is my Captain, Ed Hocken.

29:19.174 --> 29:23.042
- Is this some kind of bust?
- It's very impressive, yes...

29:23.244 --> 29:26.111
But we need to ask you
a few questions.

29:33.088 --> 29:38.185
Listen. We're looking for
Hector Savage. Where is he?

29:38.393 --> 29:40.486
Why should I tell you?

29:40.695 --> 29:43.630
Because I'm the last line of defense
between sleaze like this

29:43.798 --> 29:46.494
and the decent people in this town.

29:46.701 --> 29:53.106
Hi, Frank. We got that D-83 Swedish
Sure-Grip Suck Machine you ordered.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.009
It's a gift.

30:13.328 --> 30:18.231
Frank, come here. Quick!
It's Savage. He's on the move.

30:22.036 --> 30:24.036
What? Hey!

30:24.506 --> 30:28.306
Hey! Stop, stop! I'm a police officer!

30:29.711 --> 30:33.238
Let's go. But remember,
we can't let him spot us.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.743
Pull over!

30:37.819 --> 30:40.811
Nordberg's bugging device
is right on the money.

30:41.055 --> 30:43.489
I'm not kidding! Stop!

30:45.727 --> 30:46.727
Shit!

30:48.696 --> 30:51.028
He's changing direction. Stop the car.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.200
Oh, no!

30:54.135 --> 30:56.695
- He's getting closer.
- We should see him any minute.

30:56.905 --> 30:58.304
Keep your eyes peeled.

30:58.506 --> 30:59.906
Oh, no!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.210
Look, he's real close now.

31:05.413 --> 31:07.506
Step on it!

31:07.749 --> 31:10.650
Help! Stop, stop!

31:27.602 --> 31:29.934
Frank, stop!

31:30.138 --> 31:34.438
Stop right now! I've had it!
I said stop!

31:44.953 --> 31:45.953
Help!

31:48.556 --> 31:50.717
Drebin, Police Squad.
What do we have?

31:50.925 --> 31:54.520
It's a tense situation.
Savage is holed up in that house.

31:54.729 --> 31:58.495
- Says he's got hostages.
- He could be bluffing. Anything else?

31:58.666 --> 32:04.195
Yeah. That red van is registered
to one Quentin Hapsburg.

32:06.407 --> 32:11.276
Well, it looks like the cows
have come home to roost.

32:11.479 --> 32:13.504
How are you doing, trooper?

32:17.952 --> 32:18.952
Hey, stop firing!

32:20.154 --> 32:22.588
Hold it! Stop firing!

32:25.526 --> 32:30.122
Stop firing! Stop firing!

32:31.165 --> 32:34.532
All right, give me the bullhorn.

32:34.736 --> 32:37.034
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.

32:37.238 --> 32:41.504
Throw down your guns
and come out with your hands up,

32:41.709 --> 32:45.941
or come on out, then throw down
your guns, whichever you want.

32:46.147 --> 32:48.240
Remember the two key elements:

32:48.483 --> 32:52.783
One, guns to be thrown down.
Two, come on out.

32:52.987 --> 32:58.118
You just try and take me, Drebin!
I've got more if you want them, copper!

32:58.326 --> 33:01.784
- Looks like he's holding all the cards.
- Not all the cards.

33:01.996 --> 33:03.327
<i>How about it?</i>

33:03.498 --> 33:06.296
You can't drive that tank!
You're not checked-out on it!

33:06.501 --> 33:09.527
Don't worry, Ed!
Just keep him busy.

33:10.338 --> 33:12.704
All right, what do you want?

33:12.907 --> 33:16.809
I want a car out front.
Something fun. A Porsche.

33:17.011 --> 33:19.863
Then I want a plane ticket to Jamaica.
And I want a nice hotel.

33:19.963 --> 33:22.486
<i>No touristy place.</i>

33:23.193 --> 33:25.871
Something indicative of
the people and their culture.

33:26.042 --> 33:29.598
We can't do that.
We're calling your bluff.

33:29.791 --> 33:32.624
<i>Now put your hands on top of your head</i>
<i>and come out.</i>

33:32.827 --> 33:37.523
<i>We've got you surrounded</i>
<i>front and... hey!</i>

33:37.632 --> 33:42.569
<i>Frank, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Where are you going? Frank!</i>

34:21.676 --> 34:25.476
<i>Frank! Help!</i>

34:44.165 --> 34:46.725
- Your coat, sir?
- Yes, it is.

34:46.934 --> 34:49.835
And I have a receipt to prove it.

34:50.038 --> 34:53.030
- Telephone call, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.241
Excuse me.

34:56.577 --> 34:57.577
Yes?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.680
He did what?

35:01.949 --> 35:05.544
How many animals escaped?
Oh, my God!

35:05.787 --> 35:09.689
Good evening, Commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.

35:09.924 --> 35:14.725
Do you realize that because of you
this city is being overrun by baboons?

35:14.929 --> 35:17.955
Well, isn't that the fault of the voters?

35:18.733 --> 35:20.724
Excuse me.

35:25.640 --> 35:31.203
Thank you all for attending this
event in honor of Dr. Meinheimer,

35:31.412 --> 35:35.109
who tomorrow
will make his historic address.

35:39.687 --> 35:44.386
Along with the President, I pledge
to support his recommendations,

35:44.592 --> 35:47.254
whatever they may be.

35:54.302 --> 35:56.270
And now, please enjoy the evening.

35:57.472 --> 35:59.838
I'll see you later.

36:13.654 --> 36:15.645
May I cut in?

36:15.890 --> 36:18.518
- What are you doing here?
- I enjoy a good party.

36:18.726 --> 36:22.594
- Why are you really here?
- I can sum that up in three words:

36:22.797 --> 36:27.530
"Quentin Hapsburg." I never liked him
from the moment I laid eyes on him.

36:27.702 --> 36:30.432
The man is as dirty
as a coalminer's underwear in January.

36:30.638 --> 36:34.369
What's gotten into you?
He's a kind, gentle, concerned man,

36:34.575 --> 36:39.672
who cares about people and is not
as suspicious as some people I know.

36:39.881 --> 36:43.874
Ask him what his connection is with the
van you saw the night of the explosion.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.173
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.864
Ask him if he's pals with
a two-bit goon named Hector Savage.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.441
Stop it! You're just jealous
because another man can give me

36:54.762 --> 36:57.060
the understanding that you never could.

36:57.231 --> 37:01.930
I just hope Quentin is watching
right now, because he'll be jealous.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.902
And a jealous man
always makes the wrong move.

37:06.107 --> 37:08.337
I'm counting on that!

37:45.379 --> 37:50.544
Mr. Drebin, Mr. Hapsburg
would like you to join him at his table.

37:58.459 --> 38:03.055
- Solitaire is a lonely man's game.
- Lieutenant!

38:04.632 --> 38:08.261
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

38:08.469 --> 38:13.634
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
I sometimes go by my maiden name.

38:14.742 --> 38:18.542
Nice party.
I see a lot of familiar face-lifts.

38:20.815 --> 38:25.548
- Do you gamble, Lieutenant?
- Every time I order out.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.747
<i>Que sera, sera...</i>

38:29.991 --> 38:33.654
- You do speak French, don't you?
- Unfortunately, no.

38:33.861 --> 38:36.921
But I do kiss that way.

38:37.098 --> 38:39.623
Excuse me!
You happen to be standing in my place.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.200
Dr. Meinheimer, you remember Frank?

38:42.403 --> 38:47.306
- Uh... Mister...
- Drebin, from Police Squad.

38:47.508 --> 38:52.605
- You met him at the Institute.
- Yes, of course! Do sit down.

38:52.813 --> 38:55.281
Thank you, I don't intend to stay.

38:55.516 --> 38:58.542
Let's play another game. Who's this?

39:02.356 --> 39:04.551
- I wouldn't know.
- He's been a bad boy.

39:04.759 --> 39:09.025
He blew up a building and
is driving a van registered in your name.

39:09.230 --> 39:13.394
We own lots of vans.
One of them was stolen three days ago.

39:13.567 --> 39:16.127
Look, Lieutenant, I have nothing to hide.

39:16.337 --> 39:18.464
Maybe, but I'm warning you.

39:18.673 --> 39:22.734
If you so much as sneeze,
I'll be there to wipe your nose.

39:28.616 --> 39:33.679
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
the first door prize of the evening:

39:33.921 --> 39:38.688
an all-expense-paid trip
to the Gilligan Islands.

39:39.894 --> 39:45.491
And to draw the first winner,
we would like to ask our guest of honor:

39:45.666 --> 39:48.999
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

39:51.706 --> 39:54.698
- Let me help you.
- That won't be necessary.

39:54.909 --> 39:57.605
I don't understand
what's gotten into Frank.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.906
I'm afraid it's merely
a case of jealousy, my dear.

40:01.115 --> 40:06.018
You're going to wear all my gears down.
We shouldn't push it like this.

40:44.892 --> 40:48.885
- He gets around marvelously.
- He does.

42:02.503 --> 42:03.993
- Frank?
- Jane.

42:04.205 --> 42:08.107
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry
about what happened tonight.

42:08.309 --> 42:12.245
- Oh, Frank.
- I need to talk to you. May I come in?

42:12.446 --> 42:15.415
OK, but the place is kind of a mess.

42:16.650 --> 42:19.585
I was about to make a protein shake.
Do you want some?

42:19.787 --> 42:22.278
No, thank you.

42:22.523 --> 42:25.890
Are you sure?
I'm trying out a new recipe tonight.

42:26.093 --> 42:30.257
Do you know what Dr. Meinheimer
will say at the dinner tomorrow?

42:30.431 --> 42:34.390
Yes, he'll endorse energy efficiency
and renewable energy like solar power.

42:35.603 --> 42:39.403
- Who else knew that?
- Only me. And I told Quentin.

42:39.607 --> 42:44.067
And if the President adopts a policy of
supporting efficiency and solar energy,

42:44.278 --> 42:46.803
who would be the biggest losers?

42:47.014 --> 42:48.014
Coal, oil and nuclear.

42:49.216 --> 42:54.620
- Frank! Frank!
- Just one more question.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.985
You told me that Dr. Meinheimer
had a photographic memory,

42:58.192 --> 43:01.958
yet tonight
he never recalled meeting me.

43:02.162 --> 43:05.529
That's strange, but he has been
under a lot of stress lately.

43:05.699 --> 43:10.033
Does he have any identifying marks?
A scar, a mole, a tattoo,

43:10.237 --> 43:13.104
webbed toes or a third nostril?

43:13.307 --> 43:17.710
He has a birthmark in the shape of
<i>Whistler's Mother</i> on his right buttock.

43:17.912 --> 43:22.940
I see... Have you noticed
anything different about him?

43:23.183 --> 43:28.553
Only that he is a foot taller
and seems to be left-handed now.

43:28.756 --> 43:31.316
Frank! What are you trying to tell me?

43:31.525 --> 43:34.858
That Quentin has found
a double for Dr. Meinheimer

43:35.062 --> 43:37.895
and that he will give
a fraudulent report to the President?

43:38.065 --> 43:42.195
That's brilliant. That's a lot better
than what I had come up with.

43:42.403 --> 43:46.499
Stop it, this is preposterous!
Is there no end to your jealousy?

43:46.707 --> 43:49.107
Jane, you're hurting me.

43:49.310 --> 43:51.835
- What more do you want from me?
- Can I use your phone?

43:52.046 --> 43:54.344
- Local call?
- Yes.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.984
If you'll excuse me,
I have to take my shower.

43:58.218 --> 44:03.053
The phone is in the other room.
You can let yourself out. Goodbye.

44:19.707 --> 44:22.540
Give me Captain Ed Hocken, please.

44:30.818 --> 44:35.414
Ed, I'm onto something big.
I'll need you and Nordberg tomorrow.

44:35.656 --> 44:38.386
What is he doing in Detroit?

44:38.592 --> 44:41.060
Send him the plane fare
and a new pair of pants.

45:31.779 --> 45:36.481
<i>Of the way we were</i>

45:36.581 --> 45:39.283
<i>Memories</i>

45:39.720 --> 45:44.453
<i>Like the colors of my mind</i>

45:44.658 --> 45:48.617
<i>Misty water-colored memories</i>

45:50.898 --> 45:55.484
<i>Of the way we were</i>

45:55.584 --> 45:59.971
<i>Scattered pictures</i>

46:00.071 --> 46:04.970
<i>Of the smiles we left behind</i>

46:05.179 --> 46:11.949
<i>Smiles we gave to one another</i>

46:12.049 --> 46:16.037
<i>Of the way we were</i>

46:16.137 --> 46:20.323
<i>Can it be that it was all so simple then</i>

46:20.527 --> 46:22.927
<i>Or has time rewritten...</i>

46:25.999 --> 46:28.599
<i>Frank!</i>

47:16.617 --> 47:19.552
Just as I suspected.

47:20.487 --> 47:23.285
Come on, on your feet.

47:55.489 --> 47:56.786
Jane...

47:56.990 --> 48:00.084
What happened to the water pressure?

48:00.294 --> 48:01.294
Jane!

48:04.431 --> 48:05.631
Frank!

48:06.967 --> 48:09.401
I was so frightened!

48:10.437 --> 48:13.873
- What happened out there?
- It's nothing to worry about.

48:14.074 --> 48:18.170
But if I were you, I wouldn't leave
until they shampoo the carpets.

48:18.378 --> 48:23.042
- Who would want to kill you?
- Before tonight, only the cable company.

48:23.283 --> 48:28.778
Now I'm afraid it's one of
Hapsburg's goons. He was carrying this.

48:32.192 --> 48:36.185
Oh, Frank! I feel like such a fool.

48:37.097 --> 48:40.726
- I should never have doubted you.
- There, there...

48:40.934 --> 48:45.303
You couldn't know that the man you
were dating was a murdering sociopath.

48:45.505 --> 48:47.473
Oh, Frank!
We have to help Dr. Meinheimer.

48:48.675 --> 48:50.802
- He's in danger.
- Yes.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.639
They'll probably torture him,
then kill him.

48:53.847 --> 48:55.439
It's all my fault!

48:55.649 --> 48:59.881
They'll start by tearing out his toenails
and then move on to the nosehairs.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.554
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

49:02.789 --> 49:06.623
If my hunch is right,
they're holding him hostage here.

49:06.827 --> 49:10.263
- At the Home Club?
- What? No!

49:10.430 --> 49:14.332
At this warehouse.
I've got to get going to rescue him.

49:14.534 --> 49:18.026
- You'll be careful?
- Of course I will.

49:19.907 --> 49:21.707
I will...

49:23.143 --> 49:26.135
I guess I'd better be on my way.

49:26.980 --> 49:30.916
I promised Nordberg
we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.649
I can't fight it any more!

49:37.858 --> 49:44.698
I ran away from you once. I can't do it
again. Will you stay with me? Please?

52:51.450 --> 52:54.385
Frank, we've got
no business doing this.

52:54.620 --> 52:57.111
We've only got a dock pass
and your hunch.

52:57.356 --> 53:03.124
Hapsburg is up to something right up
to his pretty, imported shirt collar.

53:07.266 --> 53:12.690
It's a perfect day. This fog'll keep us
concealed to Hapsburg's warehouse.

53:12.797 --> 53:16.431
That's not fog. The number two
engine's on fire. They're putting it out.

53:16.642 --> 53:19.076
Let's run through this one more time.

53:19.278 --> 53:23.408
At 3:15, Nordberg will cut
the power lines, knocking out the alarms.

53:23.649 --> 53:24.809
Yeah. Right.

53:25.050 --> 53:27.075
- Nordberg.
- Got it.

53:27.319 --> 53:30.345
I'll be in the van waiting for your signal.
Are you wired-up?

53:30.589 --> 53:32.989
Yeah. Right.

53:33.325 --> 53:37.785
When you hear me say,
"I love it", you guys move in.

53:37.963 --> 53:39.954
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?

53:49.275 --> 53:51.266
The water's over there.

53:56.415 --> 53:59.009
<i>Hexagon oil commercial</i>
<i>number one.</i>

54:01.053 --> 54:04.887
<i>Piloting today's giant oil tankers</i>
<i>is a big responsibility.</i>

54:05.090 --> 54:08.491
<i>That's why here at Hexagon's</i>
<i>Tanker Captain Training School,</i>

54:08.727 --> 54:12.322
<i>future captains go through</i>
<i>a rigorous instruction programme.</i>

54:12.498 --> 54:14.659
<i>Through a complicated</i>
<i>elimination process,</i>

54:14.867 --> 54:18.098
<i>we weed out those less qualified</i>
<i>for the day-to-day operation</i>

54:18.304 --> 54:21.239
<i>of a 500,000-tonne</i>
<i>single hull super tanker.</i>

54:21.440 --> 54:23.738
<i>Only the best will take command</i>

54:23.942 --> 54:28.038
<i>of what is essentially</i>
<i>a floating ecological time bomb.</i>

54:39.892 --> 54:41.325
<i>Commercial two.</i>

54:42.795 --> 54:45.593
<i>Just the way I like it!</i>

54:46.565 --> 54:49.159
<i>Some day, way into the future,</i>

54:49.368 --> 54:53.896
<i>the sun may be able to</i>
<i>provide for all our energy needs.</i>

54:54.106 --> 54:56.597
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>it gives us a comfortable feeling</i>

54:56.809 --> 55:00.802
<i>to know that our home</i>
<i>is being supplied by nuclear power.</i>

55:01.013 --> 55:03.641
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>but we're not worried.</i>

55:03.849 --> 55:06.545
<i>We know that nuclear energy is safe.</i>

55:06.785 --> 55:10.949
<i>In fact, we think of it as</i>
<i>our friendly neighbor.</i>

55:11.156 --> 55:14.887
<i>But remember, our friend can't exist</i>
<i>without huge government subsidies.</i>

55:15.094 --> 55:18.359
<i>So tell your congressman</i>
<i>to keep those government dollars</i>

55:18.530 --> 55:20.998
<i>rolling into nuclear power.</i>

55:26.472 --> 55:28.770
I'll have to find another way in, Ed.

55:28.974 --> 55:32.102
<i>They've got killer guard dogs here.</i>
<i>Do you read me?</i>

55:32.311 --> 55:34.973
Loud and clear.
Nordberg, how are we doing?

55:36.281 --> 55:38.943
We're at our destination.

55:42.154 --> 55:44.622
Ed, I'm going to try the roof.

55:49.862 --> 55:51.887
<i>I'm going to try it again.</i>

56:34.239 --> 56:36.366
<i>- Cut the power line.</i>
- Right.

56:39.912 --> 56:40.912
Help!

56:41.647 --> 56:45.674
Come in, Nordberg.
Frank, hold on. We have a problem.

56:57.229 --> 57:00.289
Well... It's Lieutenant Drebin.

57:00.933 --> 57:04.596
You were supposed to
have been killed last night.

57:05.437 --> 57:09.931
But now I think I'm going to
enjoy doing it myself.

57:10.142 --> 57:13.305
It'll be slow and painful.

57:18.183 --> 57:21.675
- What's that smell?
- That would be me.

57:21.920 --> 57:25.822
I have been swimming in raw sewage.
I love it.

57:27.226 --> 57:28.591
I love it!

57:28.794 --> 57:31.627
That's the signal, let's go.

57:34.032 --> 57:36.330
It's stuck. Give me a hand.

57:36.535 --> 57:39.095
Ed, help me! Ed!

57:39.972 --> 57:40.972
Search him.

57:46.211 --> 57:48.211
I love it!

57:52.618 --> 57:54.677
He's wired!

57:56.421 --> 57:58.582
Tie him up!

57:58.790 --> 58:01.816
You'll never get away
with this, Hapsburg.

58:02.027 --> 58:05.861
- Whatever it is...
- All right, I'll show you.

58:06.031 --> 58:10.092
Let me introduce you to some people.

58:10.302 --> 58:16.138
Of course, you know Dr. Meinheimer.
And you've met Earl Hacker.

58:16.341 --> 58:19.333
Why you son of a...

58:19.545 --> 58:21.513
And then I'd like you
to meet the Redmans.

58:23.749 --> 58:26.274
Weekend guests from out of town.

58:27.119 --> 58:30.782
We're going to the Press Club Dinner.
Make sure nothing happens to Drebin

58:30.989 --> 58:31.989
until I come back.

58:33.191 --> 58:38.254
Then I want the pleasure
of killing you myself.

58:38.430 --> 58:40.728
The pleasure is all mine.

58:45.370 --> 58:48.134
See you after the speech, Lieutenant.

01:00:19.965 --> 01:00:22.297
- Freeze!
- That's it. Freeze!

01:00:22.501 --> 01:00:24.093
Don't move!

01:00:26.038 --> 01:00:29.371
Good Lord!
Look at what they did to Dr. Meinheimer.

01:00:30.742 --> 01:00:33.336
Are you OK, Dr. Meinheimer?

01:00:35.514 --> 01:00:38.677
That's OK. Don't try to talk.

01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:44.946
I just can't take this any more.

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:48.216
Garbage like you just makes me sick!

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:49.917
- Ed...
- OK?

01:00:50.095 --> 01:00:55.533
I'm just John Q. Public now.
It's just you and me.

01:00:56.368 --> 01:00:58.131
- Mano a mano.
- Ed...

01:00:58.336 --> 01:01:01.635
I'll teach you to pick on
a helpless invalid!

01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:10.711
All right, he's had enough!

01:01:10.949 --> 01:01:14.646
Somebody help the Captain.
We've got to get to that dinner.

01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:24.461
Any predictions, Mr. Sununu?

01:01:24.629 --> 01:01:28.190
There won't be any surprises
in Dr. Meinheimer's address.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.097
He'll recommend that the President
continues our policy of oil dependency,

01:01:32.337 --> 01:01:36.273
and more dollars for subsidizing nuclear
power, as I've recommended myself.

01:01:36.475 --> 01:01:40.912
We'll have more on the dinner later and
an update on the escaped zoo animals.

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:46.210
This is the most important evening
of my career. We can't afford mistakes.

01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:49.750
If you see Drebin or
any Police Squad near these premises,

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:52.185
I want them arrested on sight.

01:01:54.826 --> 01:01:57.761
I told Jane to meet us
at the hotel's rear entrance.

01:01:57.929 --> 01:02:00.124
- Where's that?
- In the back.

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:02.493
She'll unlock the doors at 7:30.

01:02:02.701 --> 01:02:06.398
- What about Hapsburg?
- Hopefully, she can stay clear of him.

01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:08.405
Let's go.

01:02:24.055 --> 01:02:26.055
Why, Jane!

01:02:26.825 --> 01:02:30.556
What are you doing out here?
The party's inside.

01:02:30.729 --> 01:02:34.688
Quentin! I was just getting
a breath of fresh air.

01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:42.399
I grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.

01:02:42.607 --> 01:02:45.041
Well, I'm quite sure...

01:02:45.243 --> 01:02:50.237
But how fortunate to have found you.
Now you can join me at my table.

01:03:00.892 --> 01:03:04.919
Jane! Something
must have happened to Jane.

01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:07.963
Bernardo, you've got the keys?

01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:13.226
I have a better idea. Follow me!

01:03:13.438 --> 01:03:17.738
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:17.943 --> 01:03:20.707
Thousand points of... light.
Light, a thousand points of light.

01:03:20.912 --> 01:03:25.849
Recession... bad. Recovery... good.
Yeah, I think I've got that.

01:03:26.084 --> 01:03:30.953
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

01:04:03.722 --> 01:04:06.322
<i>BÃ©same</i>

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:11.025
<i>BÃ©same mucho...</i>

01:04:11.396 --> 01:04:17.801
<i>Each time I cling to your kiss</i>
<i>I hear music divine</i>

01:04:19.437 --> 01:04:23.237
<i>BÃ©same mucho</i>

01:04:27.145 --> 01:04:33.448
<i>Hold me, my darling,</i>
<i>and say that you'll always be mine</i>

01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:35.744
We'd better make our move.

01:04:35.987 --> 01:04:40.390
Yeah, I'm thinking about something
more up-tempo, like <i>Guantanamera.</i>

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:44.618
No, I mean Hacker!
He's getting ready to make a speech.

01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:50.234
Right! I'll intercept Hacker. You get
the doctor prepared for his speech.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:09.985
Bravo! Encore!

01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:20.293
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:05:20.498 --> 01:05:23.058
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Yes?

01:05:23.268 --> 01:05:26.601
- Or should I say Hacker?
- Drebin!

01:05:30.175 --> 01:05:33.269
Look what he's doing
to that man in the wheelchair!

01:05:33.478 --> 01:05:37.710
- Can't someone help?
- Come on, guys. Let's get him!

01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:41.350
- Give me a shot at him!
- Beating a guy in a wheelchair, huh?

01:05:41.586 --> 01:05:45.317
- We'd better get this man first aid.
- Sit tight, mister.

01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:48.420
Thank you.

01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:54.155
I'm pleased and honored to be with you
tonight on this historic occasion.

01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:58.063
Tonight, Dr. Meinheimer,
as he looks up to the future,

01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:01.932
no doubt realizes
how our dependence on foreign oil

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.665
has put a stranglehold on the budget.

01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:09.370
A lot of cuts will have to be made
and some people will be hit hard.

01:06:09.581 --> 01:06:12.880
But we'll just keep cutting
until we have an impact.

01:06:13.118 --> 01:06:16.417
That's the only way
we'll be able to move forward.

01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:20.819
Now I present to you
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:39.133
Oh, my God! He can walk!

01:06:39.344 --> 01:06:41.778
He can walk! It's a miracle!

01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:47.207
I can walk!

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.786
Get off me, you moron!

01:06:53.391 --> 01:06:56.519
<i>Hey, come back here!</i>

01:06:56.728 --> 01:07:01.722
Everything seems to be OK now,
so without further ado,

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.927
<i>I present to you, once again,</i>
<i>the man who needs no introduction,</i>

01:07:06.137 --> 01:07:10.733
<i>the esteemed Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.</i>

01:07:23.788 --> 01:07:24.788
Hold it! Hold everything!

01:07:26.724 --> 01:07:29.158
- Don't listen to him. He's a fraud!
- No!

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.295
- I can prove it!
- What are you doing?

01:07:32.464 --> 01:07:34.762
The real doctor has a birthmark

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:36.934
in the shape of <i>Whistler's Mother</i>
right here!

01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:49.143
Obviously a forgery.
We'll see about this!

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:52.743
Drebin!

01:08:09.934 --> 01:08:14.962
Hold it! Frank is right.
There is a fraud in this room,

01:08:15.173 --> 01:08:17.698
but it's this man!

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:23.877
And he's just given us this signed
confession, implicating that man!

01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:29.819
No, no, no...

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:33.188
That man - Quentin Hapsburg.

01:08:35.827 --> 01:08:38.819
- They're gone!
- Let's go!

01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:49.169
- Let me go!
- The roof.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.577
Come on, Frank, hurry!
Come on!

01:09:01.752 --> 01:09:04.278
Tonight, I intend to share with you
my report

01:09:04.522 --> 01:09:06.819
on our need for a national policy

01:09:07.024 --> 01:09:12.520
based on energy efficiency and clean,
renewable energy sources.

01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:19.795
Over there!

01:09:20.004 --> 01:09:21.203
Frank!

01:09:23.774 --> 01:09:25.902
Take cover!

01:10:08.853 --> 01:10:12.721
Nordberg! Cover me, I'm going in!

01:10:40.852 --> 01:10:45.289
All right. Where's Hapsburg?

01:10:46.257 --> 01:10:48.691
- Where are you hit?
- It's not that.

01:10:48.893 --> 01:10:52.090
- You're on my groin.
- Oh, sorry.

01:10:52.263 --> 01:10:54.925
- Where is he?
- You're too late.

01:10:55.767 --> 01:10:58.531
Hapsburg has Plan B in...

01:10:58.736 --> 01:11:01.102
...in... in...

01:11:02.106 --> 01:11:05.269
Where, where? All right.

01:11:05.476 --> 01:11:08.172
Who else is almost dead?

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:12.048
OK, now...

01:11:13.384 --> 01:11:16.012
- Talk!
- You're too late, Drebin.

01:11:16.254 --> 01:11:19.018
- He already said that.
- Where did he leave off?

01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:22.454
"Hapsburg has Plan B in..."

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.596
Oh, yeah. Hapsburg has Plan B in...

01:11:26.764 --> 01:11:29.460
...in...
- Where?

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:33.000
Where? Talk, you low-life scum!

01:11:33.204 --> 01:11:36.662
Gee, if that's your attitude, forget it!

01:11:40.178 --> 01:11:42.806
I'm right here, Drebin.

01:11:45.817 --> 01:11:48.308
Drop your gun, Lieutenant.

01:11:51.689 --> 01:11:55.420
I believe you're inquiring about Plan B.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.596
That's where we detonate
a small nuclear device.

01:11:59.764 --> 01:12:03.200
Your Dr. Meinheimer
can talk all he wants.

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:05.767
No one will be left alive to hear it.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.029
<i>Detonation sequence activated.</i>

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:11.572
I'm the only one
who knows the abort code.

01:12:11.776 --> 01:12:14.973
In ten minutes,
this building and everyone in it

01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:17.670
will be reduced to a pile of rubble.

01:12:17.882 --> 01:12:20.680
I'll be safely on my helicopter.

01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:24.718
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be hunting rhino in Botswana.

01:12:24.922 --> 01:12:27.083
What do you think of that?

01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:31.728
You certainly seem to be
in touch with your anger.

01:12:31.896 --> 01:12:35.297
I don't care what you think.
You won't talk your way out of this.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.095
Go ahead! Threaten me like you have
the American people for so long.

01:12:39.303 --> 01:12:42.238
But it won't work this time.
You're part of a dying breed,

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.139
like people who can name all 50 states.
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

01:12:47.345 --> 01:12:50.906
Maybe not as much as jumping on
a bicycle with the seat missing,

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.446
but it hurts.

01:12:52.683 --> 01:12:56.642
That's as far as you go, Drebin.
Any final requests, Lieutenant?

01:12:57.889 --> 01:13:00.551
Yes. Can I have the gun?

01:13:01.793 --> 01:13:05.456
Oh, no. I'm not going to fall for that one.

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.723
Not so fast!

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.471
<i>Six minutes to detonation.</i>

01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:29.984
- All right, talk! Give me that abort code.
- OK, I'll talk.

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:32.782
- Six numbers - 2, 1, 7...
- I'm coming, Frank!

01:13:37.228 --> 01:13:38.820
Thanks a lot.

01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:57.870
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Are you OK?

01:13:58.082 --> 01:14:02.951
Yes, but unless we can disarm
this computer, the building will blow.

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:05.588
We must warn everyone.

01:14:05.823 --> 01:14:11.455
- Jane, you'd better go.
- No, Frank. I'm staying here with you.

01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:13.062
But Jane...

01:14:13.264 --> 01:14:16.233
If you're going to be blown to bits,
I want to be here with you.

01:14:19.403 --> 01:14:24.397
Jane, I promise you
that if we ever come out of this alive,

01:14:24.609 --> 01:14:28.545
I'll never let my police work
interfere with our love again.

01:14:29.547 --> 01:14:31.845
Frank. Frank!

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.442
The bomb.
Let's go, Nordberg.

01:14:35.686 --> 01:14:38.086
<i>Four minutes to detonation.</i>

01:14:38.756 --> 01:14:42.157
- What are we going to do?
- See what you can find in the manual.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:48.390
Let me see here... "To reset
detonation code, press pound sign."

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.531
<i>Per your command, the speed</i>
<i>of this sequence has been increased.</i>

01:14:53.738 --> 01:14:56.434
<i>Detonation now in two minutes.</i>

01:14:56.641 --> 01:15:02.011
So instead of spending
2.5 billion dollars

01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:06.081
on research
into nuclear waste disposal,

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:10.583
the Federal Government,
for only 500 million dollars,

01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:13.985
or the cost of one B-1 bomber,

01:15:14.191 --> 01:15:19.925
could reduce the price
of solar panels by 90%.

01:15:20.097 --> 01:15:24.295
As Albert Einstein once said...

01:15:24.502 --> 01:15:27.403
Wake up, wake up!

01:15:27.605 --> 01:15:30.233
Wake up, the place is going to blow!

01:15:33.344 --> 01:15:35.608
I'll get the lights.

01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:40.947
To elaborate on point 102...

01:15:41.185 --> 01:15:43.619
Here, read this. It's an emergency.

01:15:46.724 --> 01:15:50.182
"His strong, manly hands

01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:55.559
"probed every crevice
of her silken femininity,

01:15:56.968 --> 01:16:00.995
"their undulating bodies
writhing in a sensual rhythm

01:16:01.205 --> 01:16:04.971
"as he thrust his purple-headed warrior

01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:08.339
"into her quivering mound
of love pudding."

01:16:08.546 --> 01:16:13.279
Listen up, everyone. I want you
to calmly file towards the exits.

01:16:13.517 --> 01:16:18.750
That's it. Nobody run.
Just walk, single file.

01:16:18.956 --> 01:16:22.016
That's it. If we'll just stay calm,

01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:25.992
no one will be harmed by the huge bomb
that's going to explode.

01:16:33.671 --> 01:16:36.606
It's a cookbook, it's a cookbook!

01:16:38.109 --> 01:16:40.907
<i>Twenty seconds to detonation.</i>

01:16:41.646 --> 01:16:44.706
- What are you going to do?
<i>- 15 seconds.</i>

01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:48.180
- It's got my sleeve!
- Oh, no!

01:16:48.419 --> 01:16:49.566
<i>10, 9, 8...</i>

01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:52.851
- I can't get it.
- Jane, my jacket!

01:16:54.058 --> 01:16:57.458
<i>5, 4, 3...</i>

01:16:58.162 --> 01:17:00.062
<i>- ... 2, 1...</i>
- Let's get out!

01:17:04.168 --> 01:17:06.398
Frank, look!

01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:09.671
You did it!

01:17:18.983 --> 01:17:22.783
Thank you,
Mr. President, for those kind words,

01:17:22.987 --> 01:17:25.547
but it's all part of the job.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:29.817
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling
a special post I'm going to create.

01:17:30.027 --> 01:17:33.019
It may mean long hours,
dangerous nights,

01:17:33.197 --> 01:17:37.361
and being surrounded by some of
the scummiest elements in our society.

01:17:37.568 --> 01:17:40.469
You want me to be in your cabinet?

01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:42.471
No... No!

01:17:43.574 --> 01:17:48.705
I want you to head up
a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:55.710
- That's a great honor.
- It's what you've always wanted.

01:17:55.953 --> 01:17:57.113
Congratulations.

01:17:57.354 --> 01:17:59.288
Nice going!

01:18:00.024 --> 01:18:04.358
- Get in here.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

01:18:05.763 --> 01:18:08.664
Thank you. I'm very honored.

01:18:08.866 --> 01:18:16.170
This is something I've always dreamt of,
but I'll have to turn down your offer.

01:18:17.074 --> 01:18:20.532
You see, I've learnt something
this past week

01:18:20.745 --> 01:18:23.664
about the Earth and about love.

01:18:23.764 --> 01:18:26.478
I guess love is like the ozone layer.

01:18:27.718 --> 01:18:30.414
You never miss it until it's gone.

01:18:31.222 --> 01:18:35.158
Blowing away a fleeing suspect
with my.44 Magnum

01:18:35.392 --> 01:18:39.453
used to be everything to me.
I enjoyed it. Who wouldn't?

01:18:41.298 --> 01:18:46.531
But now I want to be known as
"The Environmental Police Lieutenant".

01:18:50.307 --> 01:18:55.472
I want a world where Frank Junior,
and all the Frank Juniors,

01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:57.738
can sit under a shade tree,

01:18:57.948 --> 01:19:01.042
breathe the air, swim in the ocean,

01:19:01.285 --> 01:19:04.550
and go into a 7-Eleven
without an interpreter.

01:19:11.128 --> 01:19:16.122
I want a world where I can eat
a sea otter without getting sick.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:21.771
I want a world where the Democrats
have a candidate worth voting for.

01:19:24.809 --> 01:19:28.677
I may not get there with you,
but most of all,

01:19:28.879 --> 01:19:32.315
I want a world
where I can wake up each morning

01:19:32.516 --> 01:19:35.383
with this woman, whom I love!

01:19:38.589 --> 01:19:39.789
Yikes!

01:19:40.457 --> 01:19:42.516
- Frank!
- Jane!

01:19:44.829 --> 01:19:48.822
- Jane, will you marry me?
- Yes, of course I'll marry you!

01:19:53.971 --> 01:19:57.532
We love Frank! We love Frank!

01:19:57.741 --> 01:20:00.835
One more picture.
Turn around, over here!

01:20:01.045 --> 01:20:02.245
Smile!

01:20:07.184 --> 01:20:09.482
Help, George!

01:24:27.144 --> 01:24:29.760
<i>All right, let's see</i>
<i>if I got this straight, now.</i>

01:24:30.039 --> 01:24:32.845
<i>Energy efficiency... good.</i>

01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:37.819
<i>Drilling in</i>
<i>Arctic national wildlife refuge... bad.</i>

01:24:38.922 --> 01:24:41.618
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>is everything OK in there?</i>

01:24:41.825 --> 01:24:43.898
<i>I'm fine, thanks.</i>

01:24:44.305 --> 01:24:50.187
