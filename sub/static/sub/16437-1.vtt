16:22.582 --> 16:26.284
 WHERE DID THIS TO'KUSTAR COME
 FROM? AND WHY IS IT ATTACKING?

16:26.286 --> 16:29.320
                QUESTIONS LATER!
                IT'S HERO TIME!

16:29.322 --> 16:31.823
       WAY BIG HERO TIME!

16:43.269 --> 16:46.771
      DOESN'T THIS THING
      EVER WORK? OH, WELL.

             UMPH!

16:48.675 --> 16:51.943
 FIRST RULE IN BATTLE--
 CONCENTRATE ON YOUR OPPONENT'S
 WEAK SPOT.

16:51.945 --> 16:56.314
   IN THE CASE OF
   TO'KUSTARS, IT'S THE FRILL
   AT THE TOP OF THE HEAD.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.584
             I'LL KEEP HIM
             DISTRACTED. NOW GO!

     THE STING OF STINKFLY!

17:15.635 --> 17:17.635

17:36.656 --> 17:37.989
THANKS, TETRAX!

17:37.991 --> 17:41.659
        NO, THANK YOU, BEN. YOU
        DESTROYED THE TO'KUSTAR.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.495
     I DID? I MEAN, I DID!

17:44.497 --> 17:48.399
    AWESOME. NOW YOU'RE
    VAPORIZING EVIL ALIENS.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.505

17:54.507 --> 17:57.842

I PACKED THE BAIT AND LUNCH.

17:57.844 --> 18:02.180
     - UM...WHICH IS WHICH?
     - [PHONE RINGS]

18:02.182 --> 18:04.048
            Y'ELLO!

18:04.050 --> 18:06.851
  - DAD, IS BEN WITH YOU?
  -<i> I THOUGHT HE WAS GROUNDED.</i>

18:06.853 --> 18:10.688
HE IS. BUT HE'S GONE. YOU DON'T
THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO
HIM?

18:10.690 --> 18:15.359
DON'T WORRY, SON. WE'LL FIND
BEN. HE CAN'T HAVE GONE TOO FAR.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.096
 [SIGH] HE ALWAYS GOES TOO FAR.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.537
 I FEAR THE TO'KUSTAR MAY HAVE
 HAD SOMETHING TO DO

18:26.539 --> 18:30.741
WITH AZMUTH'S DELAY. I SHOULD
CONTACT YOUR GRANDFATHER.

18:30.743 --> 18:34.045
           NO! I MEAN, WE NEED
           TO SEARCH FOR AZMUTH.

18:34.047 --> 18:37.582
          COVER THE WHOLE GALAXY
          IF WE HAVE TO. HOWEVER
          LONG IT TAKES.

18:37.584 --> 18:42.753
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR
BEING GROUNDED, WOULD IT?

18:42.755 --> 18:45.423
      DID I SAY GROUNDED BEFORE?

18:45.425 --> 18:49.060
    I MEANT GROUNDED IN REALITY.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.496
       LIKE A REAL HERO.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.138
WE NEED TO MAKE THE FINAL
PREPARATIONS.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.073
               MY WATCH IS FINE.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.941
THIS IS FOR YOUR

AHEAD OF US.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.980
      OH YEAH! ROAD TRIP!

19:14.754 --> 19:17.555
I'LL EXPLAIN THE NEW SETTING
ONCE WE'RE IN ORBIT.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.947
   YEAH! SAVING THE UNIVERSE
   ONCE AGAIN!

19:42.949 --> 19:45.650
   THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL!
   NO MORE TEACHERS!

   NO MORE BULLIES!
   NO MORE GETTING GROUNDED!

19:48.121 --> 19:51.455

              OW.

20:28.161 --> 20:32.063
WELL, I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM
IT ALL. NOW WHERE AM I?

20:36.169 --> 20:38.869
     I CAN'T PINPOINT BEN
     WITH A LOCATING SPELL.

     THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
     I PICK UP ANY TRACE
     OF HIS ENERGY.

  LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS SOME KIND
  OF BATTLE HERE. ALIEN BATTLE.

21:04.197 --> 21:05.529
   HOW'D THAT TRUCK GET HERE?

21:05.531 --> 21:08.599
UH, GRANDPA...I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A TRUCK.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.872

21:14.874 --> 21:17.608
        WAIT. I KNOW
        THIS SPACESHIP.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.125
   AND THAT ONE, TOO! THAT'S
   TETRAX'S SHIP!

21:38.564 --> 21:40.698
        WE NEED TO TALK.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.638
FINALLY I CAN GET A RIDE WITHOUT
FREAKING OUT THE DRIVER!

21:50.243 --> 21:52.643
           HUH? HEY!

21:52.645 --> 21:54.812

            NO. JUST RUNNING
            OUT OF TIME!

22:23.109 --> 22:25.843
WHO ARE YOU?
ANOTHER UPGRADE?

  RECOGNIZE A GALVAN PRACTICAL

      MUST HAVE CAUSED MY

           ARE INVOLVED IN THIS?

     THIS ISN'T MY PLANET.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.609
          LET ME GUESS. ANOTHER

27:58.611 --> 28:01.178
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
LOOK AT THE ANGLES.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.681
     THIS IS CLEARLY
     TETRAMAND WORKMANSHIP.

28:05.518 --> 28:08.585

    DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.470
      I'M THE SAME ALIEN.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.540
   ACTUALLY, I CAN TURN INTO
   ALL KINDS OF ALIENS.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.341
    DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

28:31.343 --> 28:32.743
             KINDA.

28:38.217 --> 28:42.386
I WILL GET THE TRUTH IF I HAVE
TO HUNT DOWN EVERY LAST ALIEN ON
THIS PLANET!

29:01.340 --> 29:04.475
      WHY AM I BACK IN
      THIS WRETCHED PLACE?

29:08.247 --> 29:10.748
     YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME,

29:20.392 --> 29:24.094
       BY THE TIME I GAINED
       CONTROL OF MY SHIP,
       THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BEN.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.197
       I WAS BARELY ABLE TO LAND
       BACK HERE IN BELLWOOD.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.233
SO YOU JUST ABDUCTED HIM?

29:29.235 --> 29:34.071
           HE VOLUNTEERED.
           IN FACT, HE SEEMED
           EAGER TO LEAVE EARTH.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.606
        HE WAS GROUNDED!

29:35.608 --> 29:38.709
  AS IN, CONFINED TO QUARTERS?

29:38.711 --> 29:40.444
   WHY? WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

29:40.446 --> 29:44.047
   KNOWING BEN, ANYTHING TO
   GET OUT OF DOING HOMEWORK.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.416
        NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

29:46.418 --> 29:50.053
       HE SAID HE WISHED
       HE'D NEVER COME BACK
       FROM OUR SUMMER VACATION.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.589
         NOW YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE
         ARE WORRIED SICK.

29:52.591 --> 29:57.094
            ALSO, I MAY HAVE
            ALTERED THE OMNITRIX

29:57.096 --> 29:59.096
             TO PREVENT BEN
             FROM TURNING HUMAN.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.764
AND HE LET YOU DO THAT?

30:00.766 --> 30:03.233
                 IT WAS FOR HIS
                 OWN PROTECTION.

30:03.235 --> 30:08.238
SO NOW BEN IS STUCK IN ALIEN
FORM AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE HE IS!

30:08.240 --> 30:11.074
     NO...BUT AZMUTH MIGHT.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.643

30:12.645 --> 30:14.578
   THAT'S HIS SHIP, ISN'T IT?

30:14.580 --> 30:18.749
SO AZMUTH DID MAKE IT TO EARTH.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

30:18.751 --> 30:22.352
        I BET WE'LL FIND
        ANSWERS INSIDE.

  ARE ON THIS PLANET?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.602
   ENOUGH TO KICK YOUR BUTT!

31:54.680 --> 31:57.247
   THEN I'LL JUST
   HAVE TO FREEZE YOUR BUTT!

32:01.921 --> 32:03.921
           [SCREAMS]

32:09.261 --> 32:11.361

UNDIVIDED ATTENTION,

32:11.363 --> 32:14.197
TELL ME WHERE I CAN
FIND YOUR TO'KUSTER BOSS!

ATTACKED THIS PLACE
YOU CALL BELLWOOD!

32:22.608 --> 32:26.743
       OH, YOU MEAN THAT
       EVIL WAY BIG?

32:26.745 --> 32:29.746
       SO YOU DO KNOW
       WHERE HE IS! TALK!

32:29.748 --> 32:33.951
    I DON'T KNOW! I WAS
    FIGHTING HIM AND HE JUST
    SORTA-- DISAPPEARED.

32:35.387 --> 32:39.356
       TO'KUSTARS! DON'T
       JUST DISAPPEAR!

33:16.495 --> 33:18.795
A VANPARTIBLAN
SONIC DISRUPTER,

33:18.797 --> 33:21.631
WHICH COULD EASILY BLAST
A HOLE IN A SPACESHIP
IN SUB-ORBIT.

33:21.633 --> 33:25.435
- YOUR POINT?
- MAYBE YOUR SHIP'S
  "MALFUNCTION" WAS NO ACCIDENT.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.437
     WHY WOULD AZMUTH WANT
     TO SHOOT DOWN MY SHIP?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.439
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER MET THE GUY.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.075

45:51.015 --> 45:54.751
    THIS WAS THE ONLY
    TRANSMISSION I RECEIVED.

46:00.191 --> 46:04.360
        - AND THEN, I KNEW
          I'D LOST HIM FOR GOOD.
        - NO.

46:04.362 --> 46:07.530
  IT BECAME MY DUTY
  TO TRACK DOWN THIS TO'KUSTAR

46:07.532 --> 46:10.433
   AND MAKE HIM PAY
   FOR TAKING AZMUTH'S LIFE.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.237
 <i> I FOLLOWED THE ENERGY SIGNAL</i>
 <i> AZMUTH HAD BEEN TRACKING</i>

46:14.239 --> 46:17.373
  <i> TO THE EARTH TOWN KNOWN AS</i>
  <i> BELLWOOD.</i>

46:17.375 --> 46:20.510
  <i> I TRIED TO STOP THE CULPRIT</i>

BUT YOU SHOT DOWN
MY SHIP BY MISTAKE!

46:33.892 --> 46:38.394
              IT WAS NO MISTAKE!
              MY TRACKER LED ME
              STRAIGHT TO HIM!

46:38.396 --> 46:41.430
NO, IT LED YOU TO
EVIL WAY BIG.

46:41.432 --> 46:43.132
BUT I GOT RID
OF HIM FOR YOU.

46:43.134 --> 46:47.236
            UH, BEN? HOW EXACTLY
            DID YOU GET RID OF
            THIS EVIL WAY BIG?

46:47.238 --> 46:49.572
       OH, YOU KNOW.
       THE USUAL HEROICS.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.074
           THE TRUTH?

46:52.076 --> 46:54.610
          [SIGH] OKAY.

46:54.612 --> 46:58.648
<i>THERE WAS A WEIRD NOISE</i>

46:58.650 --> 47:00.550
   <i> AND IT JUST VAPORIZED HIM.</i>

47:01.653 --> 47:03.252
    YOU'RE WELCOME.

47:03.254 --> 47:05.087
              WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T
              VAPORIZE IT?

47:05.089 --> 47:07.757
            WHAT IF THE OMNITRIX
            JUST DOWNLOADED
            EVIL WAY BIG

47:07.759 --> 47:10.159
               JUST LIKE

48:21.833 --> 48:24.166

   <i> I THINK WHEN IT COMBINED</i>

ANOTHER WAY, BEN.

48:54.933 --> 48:57.533
  IT'S JUST LIKE GRANDPA SAID.

49:13.885 --> 49:15.618

GET OUT OF HERE?

 AZMUTH, PLEASE! IT'S NOT HIS
 FAULT! DON'T MAKE ME HURT HIM!

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:46.241
  HE'S USING YOU AS A WEAPON?

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.610
NOT AS A WEAPON.
AS A TOOL KIT.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:51.146
HE'S TRYING
TO FIX THE OMNITRIX.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.655
          [SCREAMING]

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:07.462
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:10.165
 I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE DID!

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:16.438
          YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUSLY
          RECONSIDERING

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.408
          THE WHOLE LET-YOU-
          KEEP-MY-OMNITRIX PLAN.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.612
            AZMUTH!

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:26.281
        [HAPPY CHUCKLE]

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:27.616
         YOU'RE ALIVE!

01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:29.017
       NO THANKS TO YOU!

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.119
  THIS THING
  WAS SO OVERLOADED WITH MANNA

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:34.122
I COULD PICK UP THE READING
FROM HALFWAY ACROSS THE GALAXY.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:35.624
OVERLOADED WITH WHAT?

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:36.625
   THEY HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET?

01:01:36.627 --> 01:01:39.361
        EH. YOU'LL FIND
        OUT SOON ENOUGH.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.798
SO I SCHLEP MYSELF ALL THE WAY
TO EARTH TO DEFRAG THE OMNITRIX

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.633
   AND WHAT THANKS DO I GET?

01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:47.536
  - YOU TURN ME INTO A RAGING
    TO'KUSTAR!
  - [GIGGLES]

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:49.471
        I SHOULD'VE JUST
        STAYED IN BED.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:52.808
         SON, I--
         I ALMOST VAPORIZED YOU.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.543
           HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
           SO BLINDED BY RAGE?

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:57.212
          I'M A TERRIBLE FATHER.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:01.183
    I HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN
    THE GREATEST SON EITHER,
    DAD.

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:05.020
   I ALWAYS LET MY INVENTIONS
   COME BEFORE FAMILY.

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:08.490
      SPEAKING OF WHICH,
      I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
      WARNED YOU

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:12.227
     TO STAY AWAY FROM
     THAT MECHAMORPH ARMOR.

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:20.869
   YOU MEAN I WAS HUNTED DOWN
   ALL OVER THE WORLD

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.171
      BY A GREY MATTER
      IN AN UPGRADE SUIT?

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:27.008
DUH. HE'S AZMUTH'S DAD.
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.844
ANOTHER WAY BIG?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:31.413
       SO WHY DOES HIS DAD
       LOOK YOUNGER THAN AZMUTH?

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:34.683
  KID, YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN
  ABOUT GALVANS!

01:02:34.685 --> 01:02:37.185
 CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME, SON?

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:40.222
            CAN FORGIVE ME FOR
            SKIPPING OUT ON YOU?

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.758
    OH, SON, I ALREADY HAVE.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:48.029
 THEN WHAT SAY WE CALL IT EVEN?

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:51.700
  LET THAT BE A LESSON-- NEVER
  MESS WITH MECHAMORPH ARMOR.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:54.102
    ALL IT DOES IS PUMP UP
    THE WEARER'S AGGRESSION.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.705
TURNS 'EM INTO A SINGLE-MINDED
WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION.

01:02:56.707 --> 01:02:58.273
       TELL ME ABOUT IT.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:01.443
NOW LET'S GO HOME BEFORE ANYONE
ELSE BREAKS SOMETHING.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:05.781
ABOUT THAT-- COULD YOU DO ME ONE
MORE FAVOR BEFORE YOU GO?

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:10.051
    I SORTA TURNED
    MY PARENTS INTO ALIENS.

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.720
                        OI.

01:03:11.722 --> 01:03:14.222
            [GROWLS]

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.224
            SON! NO!

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:17.793
             WHOA!

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:25.300
         MECHANAE DISCOMBOBULUS!

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:39.748
           - [MOANS]
           - BEN!

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.349
WHERE IN THE WORLD
WERE YOU?

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.253
             WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
             EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.422
          [SIGHS] I--

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.592
   YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
   HERE TO TAKE YOU FISHING.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.761
   YOU MEAN I'M NOT GROUNDED?

01:03:52.763 --> 01:03:56.331
          HMM. I DON'T REMEMBER
          GROUNDING BEN. DO YOU,
          CARL?

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:01.269
             WHEW.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.605
     - WHERE'S THE RV, DAD?
     - OOH, UH--

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.440
 YOU PARK IT AROUND THE CORNER?

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:09.611
UH-HUH. I THINK GOING ALIEN MAY
HAVE SCRAMBLED THEIR MEMORIES A
BIT.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.513
      AT LEAST IT WAS GOOD
      FOR SOMETHING.

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:17.686
   I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID,
   BUT THANKS.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:28.997
MAX TENNYSON, I'VE
HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:30.498
          - AZMUTH?
          - YOU'RE-- ?

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.701
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THE KIDS
 WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:37.038
    I GOT A HOME AND FAMILY
    TO GET BACK TO.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.708
           I'M JUST GLAD TO KNOW
           YOU'RE ALL SAFE.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:43.144
          ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE
          NOBODY'S GOING FISHING
          THIS WEEKEND.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:45.146
  Both: THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.482
     Both: YOUR FAULT?
     HOW IS IT YOUR FAULT?

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.551
MY OMNITRIX TRASHED
THE RUSTBUCKET.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:51.987
                 ONLY BECAUSE OF
                 MY MAGIC SPELL.

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:56.258
            OH FOR THE LOVE OF--
            DO YOU TWO EVER
            STOP ARGUING?

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.582
             LET'S GO HOME, DAD.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:27.222
    HOME. I ALMOST LOST MINE
    FOR GOOD.

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:29.858
NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR
WITH YOUR FOLKS,

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.229
    I SUPPOSE THERE'S STILL
    ROOM IN THE RUSTBUCKET
    FOR A WEEKEND ROAD TRIP.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:38.266
NO, GRANDPA. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
RUN OUT ON MY PARENTS.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.703
NO POINT IN SAVING THE UNIVERSE
IF YOU LOSE YOUR FAMILY.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:43.872
    I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:46.508
YOU'LL FORGET IT AGAIN.
BUT YOU'VE LEARNED IT.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:06:01.623
   Ben: <i> IMAGINE YOU HAVE</i>
   <i> THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL</i>
   <i> TO STRANGE NEW WORLDS...</i>

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:05.560
       <i> AND ENCOUNTER</i>
       <i> ALIEN LIFE FORMS.</i>

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:09.597
   <i> IMAGINE LEAVING THE WORLD</i>
   <i> YOU KNOW, EMBARKING ON</i>
   <i> A DANGEROUS JOURNEY</i>

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.133
       <i> FROM WHICH YOU</i>
       <i> MAY NEVER RETURN.</i>

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.437
  SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION.
  BUT THAT'S WHAT IT MUST
  HAVE BEEN LIKE

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:17.639
 TO BE A CREW MEMBER
 DURING THE AGE OF EXPLORATION.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.574
SO ASK YOURSELVES THIS QUESTION:

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.310
WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO LEAVE HOME,
FAMILY AND FRIENDS

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.579
       <i> IN EXCHANGE FOR</i>
       <i> THE ADVENTURE OF</i>
       <i> A LIFETIME?</i>

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.582
        I KNOW I WOULD.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.584
       <i> BUT ONLY DURING</i>
       <i> SUMMER VACATION.</i>

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:32.821
    <i> AND I'D STILL WANT SOME</i>
    <i> FAMILY BY MY SIDE.</i>

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:48.670
   YOU'RE GOING
   TO WISH YOU'D STAYED HOME
   THIS TIME, TENNYSON!
