GREG: She had this flash
drive, had an algorithm on it.

00:10.653 --> 00:12.788
So, she had the keys
to the whole fucking world.

00:12.789 --> 00:16.258
She could read emails, text
messages, phone calls, anything.

00:16.259 --> 00:18.060
Now, why aren't we out looking for Mia

00:18.061 --> 00:20.229
instead of sitting around
and fucking talking about it?

- All right.

Why did Bershov want her dead?

08:53.542 --> 08:54.362
Why?

08:54.364 --> 08:57.564
Because we were lying
about the company assets.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.715

09:00.716 --> 09:02.684

the whole thing was a scam.

mine than we said on the financials.

16:43.278 --> 16:44.746
No.

16:45.814 --> 16:48.282
Bershov ordered this?

16:48.283 --> 16:50.485
Kelly, not Tilda.

16:51.487 --> 16:54.523
Somehow, he was expecting me.

16:56.425 --> 17:00.761
And that's why your face looks
like a sausage after the grinder?

17:00.762 --> 17:02.297
Da.

17:03.031 --> 17:05.933
Okay. Another problem
for another day.

17:05.934 --> 17:09.369
In the meantime, I am going to find out

17:09.371 --> 17:12.140
if this thing actually works.

17:13.608 --> 17:15.109
Hey.

17:17.311 --> 17:19.047
Do svidanya.

17:19.214 --> 17:20.848
Hello.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.186
I am Marty Stein.

17:26.521 --> 17:28.323
I'm a lawyer.

17:28.624 --> 17:30.292
And I...

17:31.160 --> 17:33.995
I am here to help you.

17:33.996 --> 17:36.397
Oh, shit, right.
You don't know me.

17:36.398 --> 17:37.832
I don't know you.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.333
I've heard you're a very smart lady,

17:39.334 --> 17:41.435
but you know what,
I'll tell you something.

17:41.436 --> 17:46.575
Being a very smart lady and being a very
dead lady doesn't do anyone any good.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.310
I know who you are.

17:49.311 --> 17:52.680
Oh, good. Yay!
Then we're halfway there.

17:52.681 --> 17:56.017
Good. I hate introductions.
I'll tell you what.

17:56.018 --> 17:58.653
You know, half the meetings I go to,

17:58.654 --> 18:02.123
most of the time is spent on who
you know, where you've been,

18:02.124 --> 18:04.692
what fucking prep school you went to,

18:04.693 --> 18:08.196
when we could be getting
right down to business.

18:08.664 --> 18:10.264
Go fuck yourself.

18:10.265 --> 18:14.101
Okay, that was nasty
and really not very smart.

18:14.102 --> 18:18.272
I'm a dead woman, we both know that.
I see no need to be polite.

18:18.273 --> 18:21.676
Ah, you see, this is where an
introduction might have come in handy.

18:21.677 --> 18:23.444
(LOUDLY) I'm Marty Stein.

18:23.445 --> 18:26.981
I fix people's problems.
That's what I do.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.483
Poof, they're gone!
Like magic.

18:29.484 --> 18:30.985
I know you work for Bershov.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.054
I advise Bershov, yes.

18:33.055 --> 18:34.689
Yeah?

18:34.690 --> 18:36.825
Well, sometimes he takes
his own advice.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.328
Ah.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.700
Can I ask you something, Mia?

18:47.336 --> 18:50.504
Why do you think you're still here?

18:50.505 --> 18:53.507
Still breathing?
I'll tell you why.

18:53.508 --> 18:56.510
Because of me.
Marty Stein to the rescue.

18:56.511 --> 18:59.780
- Why would you do that?
- That is a very good question.

18:59.781 --> 19:03.951
You show me how this thing works

19:03.952 --> 19:07.321
and I will get our Russian
friends not to kill you.

19:07.322 --> 19:10.858
I think that's a very fair exchange.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.794
Yeah, the problem is
I don't fucking trust you.

19:13.795 --> 19:15.830
Based on what?

19:15.831 --> 19:17.932
What Ethan Kelly told you?

19:17.933 --> 19:20.668
(CHUCKLES) Really?

19:20.669 --> 19:22.603
Can I tell you something
about Ethan Kelly?

19:22.604 --> 19:25.873
Half of the crap that comes
out of his mouth is just that.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.277
A big pile of stinking,
steaming bullshit!

19:30.679 --> 19:32.380
He didn't try and kill me.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.515
Not yet.

19:34.516 --> 19:38.553
But we all know
about Ethan Kelly, right?

19:38.954 --> 19:40.822
He's an opportunist.

19:41.023 --> 19:42.723
Think about it.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.625
And while you're thinking about that,

19:44.626 --> 19:46.727
think about how our Russian
friends are going to react

19:46.728 --> 19:49.163
when I tell them who you really are,

19:49.164 --> 19:52.634
Mia... Or should I say Anna?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.372
Anna.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.808
Impressed, huh?

20:00.809 --> 20:03.277
Tell you what, you never know what
little tidbits of information

20:03.278 --> 20:07.215
are gonna pop right out of my
mouth at any given moment.

20:10.986 --> 20:13.120
Fine.

20:13.121 --> 20:17.992
Yay! I had a feeling
that you'd see it my way.

20:17.993 --> 20:21.996
Good. Okay, now,
just to make sure

20:21.997 --> 20:25.132
that you are not
completely full of shit,

20:25.133 --> 20:29.537
I would like you to start at the very top
of this list. Mr. Furnell Washington.

There's only three in Chicago. One
Nigel Pulaski is a business professor.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.224
That doesn't sound like our guy.

20:50.225 --> 20:52.093
He's been to Russia
three times this past year.

20:52.094 --> 20:54.195
Twice to Moscow,
once to St. Petersburg.

20:54.196 --> 20:56.097
Where's Renner?

21:01.269 --> 21:03.838
Yeah, I'm fine, Jen.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.906
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

21:05.907 --> 21:07.908

- Not you.
- No, God, no.

Says you can handle yourself.

28:58.146 --> 29:01.648
So you already knew
that I worked with him?

It's called a conversation

to come down to the office.

He wanted to tell me something, yeah.

29:35.884 --> 29:37.784

29:37.785 --> 29:39.820
I guess not.

Did he seem afraid?

29:41.656 --> 29:44.458
- No.
- Panicked?

29:44.459 --> 29:47.094
He sounded like a boss who wanted
someone who worked for him

29:47.095 --> 29:49.529
to come down to the office.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.565

is normal in this business.

at the farmhouse.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.193
They pulled up a pretty fresh body.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.629
- How fresh?
- Two, three days.

30:22.630 --> 30:24.965
- Is it Patrick?
- It's too soon to tell.

31:00.635 --> 31:01.802

it was manual strangulation, right?

41:25.859 --> 41:28.061
in the case of the murder
of Talia Freeman,

41:28.062 --> 41:31.264

rights advocate, Furnell Washington,

41:31.265 --> 41:32.865

was somehow involved in her death.
