03:59.239 --> 04:02.073
Meet me out back, all right?

04:06.830 --> 04:07.820
Hello.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.665
Hi.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.962
Hi. You must be Charley. Lynn.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.209
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.507
You want some breakfast?

04:20.135 --> 04:21.296
Sure. Yeah.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.128
Where'd you get the food?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.213
Well, I made your dad
go to the grocery store

04:26.308 --> 04:29.642
'cause all you had in the fridge
was beer and Cap'n Crunch,

04:29.728 --> 04:31.344
which I'm betting was yours.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.849
So?

04:32.939 --> 04:36.774
Well, you don't need to keep cereal
in the refrigerator, you know?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.978
Oh, well, we got roaches.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.564
One of them
got in the last box I left out.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.320
Determined little fuckers, huh?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.366
Uh, is it okay if I get a glass of water?

04:50.165 --> 04:51.701
Yeah, of course.
It's your house, isn't it?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.284
Charley, you take
my fucking belt again?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.208
No!

04:55.295 --> 04:56.706
Well,
then we must have been robbed...

04:56.797 --> 04:58.288
Never mind...

05:02.886 --> 05:05.048
- You meet Lynn?
- Yeah, we met.

05:07.057 --> 05:07.968
Met her at work.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.141
She's a secretary.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.971
Front office. Hmm?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.096
- Go ahead, have a seat.
- Where's my...

05:15.190 --> 05:16.306
It's almost ready.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.524
How far did you run today, kiddo?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.698
I found a horse track. Just around here.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.485
Have you seen it?

05:29.996 --> 05:30.986
I've driven past it.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.997
- We should go sometime.
- Mm-hmm.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.371
- All right, here you go.
- Oh!

05:36.670 --> 05:37.911
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.588
- Mmm.
- Good?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.257
- Delicious.
- Mm-hmm?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.089
All right, it's that time.
I'm gonna get ready.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.385
Oh...

06:01.528 --> 06:02.644
Is she your new girlfriend?

06:03.822 --> 06:04.733
Is she gonna be?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.780
I don't know. Why? Do you wanna fuck her?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.944
I like her better than Marlene.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.121
Marlene was smart for a stripper.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.322
Marlene was mean.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.491
And she couldn't cook like this either.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.958
- Lynn and I just work together, you know.
- Plus she's married.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.876
Really?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.337
Well, she's separated,
but her husband's a Samoan.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.882
So, he'll probably cut my head off
with a machete.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.766
- What's a Samoan?
- Big motherfuckers, that's what.

06:37.856 --> 06:38.892
They play football.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.265
Is he gonna be mad?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.142
Ah...

06:44.279 --> 06:47.488
She said he moved in
with some other woman, so who knows?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.320
Is he gonna come here?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.493
Hell, Charley, I'm just talking.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.785
Plus, he doesn't know
where we live.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.295
So, don't worry about it, huh?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.083
What did you do last night?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.177
Um, I just watched TV.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.801
Yeah? Watched TV? Anything good on?

07:13.642 --> 07:14.758
No, nothing.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.643
All right, let's get a move on,
we're gonna be late.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.307
See you around, Charley.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.024
Oh, thanks for breakfast.
You're a really good cook.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.099
Anytime.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.648
You gonna be okay on your own today?

07:30.742 --> 07:31.949
Yeah, sure.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.401
Yeah? Here.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.910
Oh, thanks, Dad.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.165
Sorry I can't give you more.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.132
Oh, don't worry about it. This is...
I don't need any more.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.972
Don't wait up, okay?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.559
- <i>Hear that?
- Yeah.</i>

07:59.646 --> 08:01.888
<i>He likes your cooking.
Said you're a good cook.</i>

11:29.314 --> 11:33.649
Ah, you motherfucking,
cocksucking fuck!

11:38.364 --> 11:39.821
Hey, what are you doing?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.357
Me?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.277
Yeah, there's no one else here.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.204
- I was just running.
- All right, you strong?

11:49.751 --> 11:50.912
- I don't know.
- Come here.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.872
You know what time it is?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.208
It's about 7:00.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.551
Right, I got to load two horses
and get to Wenatchee by 1:00,

12:04.641 --> 12:07.509
and I got a fucking flat, all right?

12:07.769 --> 12:09.476
My hand is killing me. How about...

12:10.563 --> 12:12.725
how about you get those lug nuts off,
I'll give you ten bucks?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.099
Come on, ten bucks.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.232
Yeah, keep going, keep going.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.777
Keep going.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.956
- I'm Del, by the way.
- I'm Charley.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.748
- What's in...
- Wenatchee? A race.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.583
- A horse race?
- Well, yeah, a horse race.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.586
What do you think
goes in this trailer? Dogs?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.259
Hey, would you need help?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.589
- Help with what?
- With anything.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.681
- How old are you?
- I'm 16.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.727
You know much about horses?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.096
Not really.

12:57.318 --> 13:01.187
Would your... Would your folks be okay
with you spending the night away?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.614
'Cause I... I can't drive
there and back in a day.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.157
Where would we be staying?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.030
I'm just gonna sleep in the truck.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.865
You can sleep wherever you want,
I don't care.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.196
You got a sleeping bag?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.454
Yeah, would we have time to go and get it?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.035
- Where do you live?
- Delta Park.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.786
Yeah, let's go get it.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.749
Hey, how much would you be paying me?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.297
Twenty-five dollars. Take it or leave it.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.766
- Okay. I'll take it.
- All right. Get in. Come on, let's go.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.638
Gotta get these damn horses loaded.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.400
- Those boots feel okay? They too big?
- No, these are great.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.153
You don't want to lose your fucking toes
with the shoes you were wearing.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.405
How many horses live in here?

13:50.079 --> 13:53.038
Well, when the races start, there's...
could be up to 50 in a row,

13:53.124 --> 13:56.367
and there's about 25 rows,
so it's over 1,000 horses.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.877
How many of them are yours?

13:58.963 --> 14:04.800
Shit, I used to have...
20 or so. Now I got about six.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.298
All right, this is Tumbling Through.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.129
Be careful. He's a biter, all right?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.681
If he goes for you,
just smack him on the nose, he'll quit.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.055
Just take him out there
and wait for me, all right?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.511
- Straight down there?
- Stay down there.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.396
Take him, just go.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.975
Come on, you lazy piece of crap.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.982
Come on. Don't give me
any of your shit today.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.071
Don't let him stop on you.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.741
If he tries to stop,
just give him a quick pull.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.653
If he pulls away from you,
just give him a harder pull.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.368
Never let go of the rope.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.457
If you let go of it,
he'll fucking run on you.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.216
Come on, come on, come on.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.421
No, no, what are you doing?
Don't wrap the rope around your hand.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.381
That's a good fucking way
to lose your hand.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.632
Here, let's switch.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.050
This one's a pussy.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.512
Just wait.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.264
Come on, come on.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.689
- What's this one's name?
- Lean On Pete.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.771
Get in.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.526
How old are the two horses?

15:13.663 --> 15:17.498
Uh, Tumbling Through is two.
He's green, but he can run.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.117
Lean On Pete is five.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.171
He's a piece of shit,
but he's good enough for this.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.090
- You know what a Quarter Horse is?
- No.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.963
Quarter Horse is a breed.

15:29.679 --> 15:33.923
In racing, they're sprinters.
Anything from 100 to 400 yards.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.639
The tracks don't give a shit
about Quarter Horses anymore.

15:38.980 --> 15:44.601
Maybe Los Alamitos, but...
you won't see me again in California.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.144
Why not?

16:06.632 --> 16:07.748
In this one?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.466
Yes, go ahead, come on.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.971
Do you know how to drive?

16:23.691 --> 16:24.681
Uh, yeah.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.275
You sure? I don't want
you messing up my truck.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.528
My dad has a van.
He lets me drive it sometimes.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.651
Yeah, but this one's tricky.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.148
I'll be fine.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.068
All right. Take the truck,
park it around over there.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.949
I want you to clean
the shit out of the trailer.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.281
There's a broom and a shovel
in the bed of the truck.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.408
Then come back here
and find me, all right?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.869
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go race Tumbling Through.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.457
Shut that gate.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.206
You better not fucking lose today.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.958
You know what happens if you do.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.257
Hey, don't run. Walk.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.335
<i>And they're off!</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:43.260
Where's Tumbling Through? Did he win?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.766
He bowed a tendon, so I sold him.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.640
I got enough fucked-up horses as it is.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.058
Who did you sell him to?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.523
He's going to Mexico. Hold that.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.231
Is he in a lot of pain?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.191
- It's not my problem anymore.
- What is that stuff?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.027
Here, stay here. It's just vitamins.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.820
Come here, come here.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.697
Get in there. Good boy.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.623
- Good boy.
- What kind of vitamins?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.502
What did I tell you
about too many questions?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.333
Zip that up and put it in the truck.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.749
You gonna fucking win today, huh?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.584
It's up to you. It's up to you.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.344
All right? Come on.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.299
All right, all right.
Open the gate. Come on.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.721
It's your first race?

18:28.566 --> 18:29.556
Yeah.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.609
Don't blink. It's over in,
like, two seconds.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.944
Come on!

18:42.955 --> 18:46.323
Come on, you... Come on!
Oh, what the fuck?

18:46.417 --> 18:47.373
Come on. Come on!

18:56.302 --> 18:57.543
Did you see how fast he was going?

18:57.803 --> 18:58.793
He ain't fast.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.972
If he hadn't beat that slug,
I would've slit his throat.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.508
Pete ain't fast,
the other horse is just a pig.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.344
Now, listen.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.065
I want you to walk him down that road
and cool him off.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.892
Then we got to get the hell
out of here, all right,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.319
before those fuckers get drunk
and want their money back.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.464
Come on.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.739
All right. There you go.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.614
Uh, this is a 50.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.449
I know. You did good today.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.910
Now let's get Pete
and put him in the paddock.

20:41.532 --> 20:42.522
Hey, Pete.

20:46.912 --> 20:47.902
How you doing?

21:05.723 --> 21:06.713
Where you been?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.762
I left a note. I got a job.

21:10.060 --> 21:10.971
What kind of job?

21:12.021 --> 21:14.308
Uh, working for this guy
named Del at the horse track.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.390
And that's who you went off with?

21:17.860 --> 21:18.850
Yeah.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.311
We went up to this ranch
in Washington for a race and...

21:21.405 --> 21:22.395
Where did you sleep?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.486
On the bed of his truck.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.366
I got $50.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.325
- Fifty bucks?
- Yeah.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.042
And this guy seems all right?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.787
I guess.

21:39.757 --> 21:40.793
I mean, he paid me.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.631
I got more food.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.300
He get you those fancy boots, too?

21:45.179 --> 21:47.262
Oh, these are just
so I don't break my toes.

22:04.365 --> 22:05.697
Well, ain't you a piece of work.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.161
You know, I was a cook for two years
once I dropped out of school.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.705
Yeah, I know.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.079
It's no way to live, though.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.833
Getting up at 4:00 every morning.
Getting hit by grease all day.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.210
People complaining,
orders backing up, it's...

22:23.467 --> 22:24.583
it's no way to live.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.044
Yeah, but you get free food.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.713
Yeah, you get free food.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.675
But let me tell you,
you end up hating food.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.057
But there are waitresses.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.814
- Hmm.
- You like waitresses, don't you?

22:40.568 --> 22:41.558
Yeah, I guess.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.109
The best women

22:43.988 --> 22:45.980
have all been waitresses at some point.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.665
So, what have you learned?

22:58.544 --> 22:59.534
Mmm...

23:02.256 --> 23:03.838
Don't be a cook.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.456
And...

23:07.094 --> 23:07.959
go out with waitresses.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.419
Boom.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.756
Besides being a hotshot athlete
and getting a job,

23:13.350 --> 23:14.340
you're smart, too.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.518
No, not over your neck.
Drape the rope over your shoulder.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.483
Good, all right. Come on.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.860
It's okay. It's okay.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.027
Hey, hey, hey...

23:27.406 --> 23:29.318
- Slow down, slow down.
- You remember what I told you yesterday?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.398
Yep.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.785
Hook him up before you take the rope off.
'Cause he'll run on you.

23:34.955 --> 23:35.945
Good.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.286
See that, Bob? This kid's a natural.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.796
Yeah. He's a good kid.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.464
And he ain't afraid of a hard day's work
like some of these other kids.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.636
Come on, Pete, it's all right.

23:51.722 --> 23:52.963
Just relax your arm.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.516
You're walking.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.432
I know. I know. You're just excited.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.931
- You did real good.
- Come on, Pete.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.851
You got it.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.685
Just happy.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.025
There you go,
keep moving, keep moving.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.026
Stay ahead of him.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.867
Yeah, yeah.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.663
You singing a song?

24:25.798 --> 24:26.629
Oh.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.876
- There you go, hon.
- Thanks.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.501
Put it on my tab, Cindy.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.838
Mmm.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.265
Jeez, you don't have any manners, do you?

24:43.649 --> 24:44.765
What did I do wrong?

24:46.860 --> 24:50.774
You just wolfed down half a sandwich
before I even started.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.569
You don't just shovel food
in your mouth like it's...

24:54.868 --> 24:56.029
You're not a pig, are you?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.276
No.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.826
Then let yourself chew.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.038
I don't know how you get it down
without choking.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.620
You gotta chew your food.
What does your mom say?

25:08.549 --> 25:09.665
I don't know. I don't know her.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.044
Well, does your dad have any manners?

25:16.682 --> 25:18.548
I don't know. I guess
I haven't really noticed.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.806
Did your mom leave you or something?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.222
Yeah.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.643
And she never showed up again?

25:31.113 --> 25:32.024
No.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.735
Huh. That's something
you don't hear about too often.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.692
Mom leaving her kid.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.493
She must've been a real piece.

25:42.583 --> 25:43.699
You don't have a stepmom?

25:44.209 --> 25:45.245
More coffee?

25:45.335 --> 25:46.325
Uh, no.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.744
Thanks.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.704
That's a shame.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.206
A kid needs a mother.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.250
There's my Aunt Margy.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.211
Yeah? Do you see her?

25:58.932 --> 26:00.048
No, not really.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.684
Her and my dad got in a big fight,
and they don't speak anymore.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.887
Fight about what?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.390
Me, I guess.

26:09.985 --> 26:10.975
Yeah, what did you do wrong?

26:11.779 --> 26:12.769
Nothing.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.438
I was just 12 and...

26:16.825 --> 26:18.908
my dad went away for a few days
with some girl,

26:18.994 --> 26:21.407
and Aunt Margy found out,
and she got pretty mad.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.034
She wanted me to live with her instead.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.616
But you didn't?

26:27.878 --> 26:28.868
No.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.460
Look, Charley, look,
if we're gonna be eating together,

26:36.553 --> 26:38.636
you gotta get some manners.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.596
But don't be asking me, okay?

26:40.682 --> 26:43.550
Because I don't have time
to teach you everything, all right?

26:45.604 --> 26:46.594
All right.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.181
I'm gonna go home. That's it for today.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.436
You can take off, too.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.143
There's your pay.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.321
Why is this less than last week?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.662
I just bought you lunch,
didn't I?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.369
And I'm letting you go home early.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.374
Open the fucking door!

27:49.459 --> 27:52.372
Look, calm down, buddy!
I didn't do fucking nothing.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.249
I heard what you two did tonight!

27:54.590 --> 27:55.546
Dad, what's going on?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.373
Charley, get the fuck
back in your room.

27:57.968 --> 27:58.799
Shit.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.468
Come in. Come in.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.262
Calm down. Calm down. Maybe I can help.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.884
You wanna talk about it?
I'll get you a beer.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.183
We should have a beer together.
Just stop. Shh.

28:07.728 --> 28:08.559
Fuck you.

28:08.645 --> 28:09.761
Dad!

28:14.151 --> 28:17.235
Stop it! Get off... Charley!

28:24.870 --> 28:26.987
Oh...

28:43.680 --> 28:45.672
You okay? You okay?

28:47.184 --> 28:49.096
Okay...

28:49.186 --> 28:51.644
Okay, okay, okay...

28:51.897 --> 28:53.229
Call 911!

28:54.191 --> 28:56.057
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.019
Okay, I'm gonna be right back, okay? Okay.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.063
Call 911, please!

29:03.033 --> 29:04.524
My dad is really hurt!

29:06.578 --> 29:08.695
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.365
No, no, no...

29:14.419 --> 29:16.331
- Where are they taking him?
- To Samaritan.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.625
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Why don't we get out of the road?

29:18.715 --> 29:19.956
Can you tell us what happened tonight?

29:20.467 --> 29:21.503
I don't know.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.461
I was just asleep,
and this guy started beating on the door,

29:24.554 --> 29:25.590
and he broke the lock.

29:25.847 --> 29:26.837
Do you know his name?

29:27.391 --> 29:28.347
No.

29:28.433 --> 29:32.347
But my dad was seeing this lady,
and she was married to this Samoan.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.644
And what's her name?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.471
Um, Lynn.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.894
- I don't know her last name.
- How old are you?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.313
I'm 15.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.644
Do you have someone
to look after you tonight?

29:44.700 --> 29:45.861
My aunt's coming.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.733
Are you sure?

29:48.328 --> 29:49.944
Yeah, she's on her way right now.

29:50.747 --> 29:51.954
All right. Wait here a minute.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.447
We'll be right back.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.375
We should call Family Services.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.044
Give me the number, I can call them.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.787
<i>So, your dad
just got out of surgery,</i>

30:32.873 --> 30:34.330
<i>so he's gonna look a little bit messed up.</i>

30:34.875 --> 30:37.583
<i>The glass actually ended up
cutting his bowels,</i>

30:37.669 --> 30:39.877
<i>so it seeped an infection into his gut.</i>

30:40.589 --> 30:42.376
- Is that serious?
- Yes.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.500
It's very serious.
It's like he's been poisoned.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.350
Okay, I'm gonna leave you two alone.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.645
Just try not too much talking...

31:05.739 --> 31:07.401
...your dad needs to rest.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.441
Hey.

31:11.995 --> 31:12.985
Does it hurt?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.196
No.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.957
They got me pretty doped up.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.206
You're gonna be okay?

31:27.886 --> 31:28.876
I hope so.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.097
Do you think he's gonna come back?

31:37.854 --> 31:39.686
No. He won't be back.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.853
Big fucker.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.644
Yeah.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.440
He's the biggest guy I've ever seen.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.989
I'm sorry...

31:56.540 --> 31:59.453
that he threw you
through the door like that.

31:59.876 --> 32:00.866
Hey.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.035
I'm gonna be fine.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.916
- You should go home. Get some sleep.
- Mmm. No, no.

32:08.552 --> 32:09.884
I'm gonna stay right here, okay?

32:12.264 --> 32:15.974
- I'm not gonna be much company.
- I'm gonna stay right here.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.725
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.553
- Okay?
- Yeah.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.103
I'm gonna stay right here.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.360
Okay.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.567
Okay.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.766
Hey, Dad.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.739
Do you think you could give me
the number for Aunt Margy?

33:17.370 --> 33:18.406
Why?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.784
Well, just so I could call her.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.536
I think... maybe she could help right now.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.256
We can take care of ourselves.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.510
You and me.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.099
We don't need anyone's help.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.137
No, I know.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.557
But...

33:49.778 --> 33:51.189
with you being here and...

33:52.405 --> 33:55.944
me being back home, uh...

33:58.870 --> 34:00.782
You know what you need to do?

34:03.166 --> 34:06.000
You need to go home,
get a good night's sleep.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.252
You're the only one working, you know.
We need that money.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.130
I ain't gonna get shit being laid up.

34:17.429 --> 34:18.545
So, it's up to you.

34:25.730 --> 34:26.719
Okay.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.678
Hey, buddy.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.471
Just me.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.808
Hey.

36:37.487 --> 36:40.730
I'm gonna be staying next door
for a little while until Dad gets better.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.652
Promise not to tell Del.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.704
You know he wouldn't like it much.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.418
It's gonna be fun, 'cause I'm gonna...

36:54.963 --> 36:56.545
get to come visit you a lot more.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.550
No, I understand,

37:05.640 --> 37:07.677
but can you tell him
that I'll be away for the night,

37:07.767 --> 37:09.099
but that I'll be back tomorrow?

37:09.185 --> 37:11.723
- <i>Sure, I'll tell him.</i>
- Now you promise you'll tell him that?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.475
<i>Yes, I promise I'll tell him.</i>

37:14.023 --> 37:15.139
<i>He's doing fine.</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:16.269
- Okay.
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

37:17.110 --> 37:18.066
Yeah, thank you very much.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.815
Charley, hurry the fuck up!

37:19.904 --> 37:20.985
All right, you too. Thank you.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.191
There she is.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.280
Move over.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.198
Get in the front.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.371
Hey.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.290
This is Charley.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.926
- Hey, Charley, I'm Bonnie.
- Are you a jockey?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.011
She's too fat
to be a real jockey.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.181
Ugh, I just lost seven pounds.
I'm down to 122.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.432
Yeah?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.134
I swear to God.
Get a fucking scale right now.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.264
Oh yeah, okay.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.398
<i>So, what
do you like to do, Charley?</i>

38:05.492 --> 38:07.734
<i>When Del here isn't making you do
all his dirty work?</i>

38:07.827 --> 38:10.695
- <i>I run. I play football.
- At school?</i>

38:10.789 --> 38:12.496
Yeah. But not yet.

38:12.832 --> 38:15.495
I played in Spokane.
I was on the freshman team.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.785
We won eight games in a row.

38:18.588 --> 38:19.578
What position?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.460
Corner. And sometimes wide receiver.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.710
But... I'm too little
to play anything else.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.923
I'm waiting to lift weights
until I stop growing.

38:32.227 --> 38:36.346
I haven't grown in six months, so...
maybe soon.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.268
Why did you move to Portland?

38:40.777 --> 38:42.393
My dad moved here for work.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.230
- What does he do?
- Can we not talk?

38:47.408 --> 38:48.819
I ain't talking to you.
I'm talking to the kid.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.824
I was tired of talking to you 15 minutes
after I met you 20 years ago.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.241
That's a good one.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.327
Just tell it like I see it.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.854
<i>Is it hard being a girl jockey?</i>

39:27.073 --> 39:28.735
It isn't easy, that's for sure.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.072
I used to work out horses up at the track
for a couple of trainers.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.781
They always promised me rides.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.239
And then when it came time,
never called my name.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.533
So, I just had to wait around
for the horses no one else wanted to ride.

39:40.753 --> 39:41.743
Did you ever get hurt?

39:42.672 --> 39:46.040
Yeah, once at a race in Union,
which is way out in Eastern Oregon,

39:46.134 --> 39:47.124
I was in the gate,

39:47.343 --> 39:49.130
this horse reared up,
flipped over backwards,

39:49.220 --> 39:50.210
and I couldn't get out.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.420
He landed on me.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.636
- What happened?
- Broke my pelvis, punctured a lung.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.133
My mom was there.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.511
She saw me on the ground,
screaming out in pain.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.268
All she said was, "You're not too hurt
to run in the seventh, are you?"

40:03.067 --> 40:04.774
Got a job at Red Lobster after that.

40:05.987 --> 40:06.977
I like that place.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.694
I went to the one in Spokane with my dad
for my 13th birthday.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.992
But then I went back.
And that's what happens.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.204
I started riding for this guy
that made Del look like a good guy.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.077
I mean, a real pervert.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.749
He liked to watch girls taking a piss.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.623
Then there was another horse that spooked.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.418
Threw me into the rail,
and I broke my back.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.916
- Shit.
- It was worse for the horse.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.342
Broke both his forelegs.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.794
Something I'd hardly ever seen before.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.253
Hey, what can I get you?

40:34.098 --> 40:36.135
- Uh, elephant ear.
- All righty.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.263
And then what?

40:38.728 --> 40:40.890
Then I met Del. He lets me ride.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.523
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.061
Sometimes I think I might quit.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.235
There's only so many times
you can fall down, right?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.034
You could go back to Red Lobster.

40:57.830 --> 40:58.741
That I could.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.421
Yeah!

41:14.973 --> 41:15.963
Hey, Bonnie?

41:16.349 --> 41:17.339
What?

41:19.060 --> 41:21.427
I heard someone down by the track

41:21.521 --> 41:24.138
saying that Del runs
his horses into the ground.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.897
You think he'll do that with Pete?

41:26.776 --> 41:30.065
Well, it's true. If Del's broke,
he'll run his horses every two weeks.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.486
Sometimes even once a week.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.189
And is he broke?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.567
He's broke a lot more than he used to be.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.954
We haven't done the fair circuit
in a long while. We're here now, so...

41:42.250 --> 41:43.115
Don't worry about Pete.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.121
He's a Quarter Horse,
so he's got that going for him.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.918
And he's probably been
laid up for a while.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.414
Listen, you can't get attached
to the horse.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.374
Why not?

41:52.760 --> 41:55.548
'Cause you can't think of them as pets.
They're here to race and nothing else.

41:57.473 --> 41:58.964
If they lose too much, they get fired.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.550
Just the way it is.

42:03.730 --> 42:04.937
Come on, let's get going.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.063
<i>This race
is a Quarter Horse event.</i>

42:10.153 --> 42:12.110
<i>Just a 200-yard dash
down the straightaway.</i>

42:12.196 --> 42:13.778
<i>Don't blink or you might miss it.</i>

42:13.865 --> 42:17.074
<i>Here's Bonnie Durand riding
number one, Lean On Pete.</i>

42:18.745 --> 42:19.656
Come on, Pete.

42:19.746 --> 42:21.578
<i>Lean On Pete into gate one
on the inside.</i>

42:45.772 --> 42:48.014
<i>Lean On Pete and Bonnie
broke well down...</i>

42:48.107 --> 42:48.972
Faster, Pete.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.433
- Come on!
- Go, go!

42:53.237 --> 42:55.103
.<i>..but it's all Lean On Pete.</i>

42:56.199 --> 42:58.657
<i>Lean On Pete and Bonnie Durand
hit it with ease.</i>

42:58.743 --> 43:00.609
- We won!
- Yeah.

43:00.703 --> 43:01.693
Did you see?

43:02.246 --> 43:03.236
No.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.824
Holy shit.

43:08.044 --> 43:09.455
- He won, right?
- Yes.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.210
Here.

43:18.638 --> 43:20.049
- Did you get rid of it?
- Yep.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.132
Looks like Rodriguez is gonna
send out a search party.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.342
Don't worry about it.

43:26.354 --> 43:27.890
Is he okay?

43:28.439 --> 43:30.055
Yeah, he just ran faster
than he should have.

43:31.776 --> 43:32.937
What are the tests for?

43:34.403 --> 43:35.814
They test the winner for drugs.

43:36.864 --> 43:37.854
Did Del give him something?

43:38.324 --> 43:40.737
- Is that why he ran fast?
- No. Keep your voice down.

43:44.497 --> 43:45.829
What did you tell him you got rid of?

43:49.669 --> 43:50.659
A buzzer.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.370
- What's that?
- Don't worry, they won't find it.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.545
Yeah, but what is that?

43:54.841 --> 43:56.377
Just gives the horse a little shock.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.416
What kind of shock?

44:00.721 --> 44:01.711
Hi.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.142
We good?

44:16.487 --> 44:17.648
Let's get the fuck out of here.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.527
- See you, Richie.
- All right.

44:24.036 --> 44:27.200
Man, that Rodriguez
is one suspicious son of a bitch.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.781
Huh. I wonder why?

44:41.762 --> 44:42.969
Don't worry, he's fine.

44:50.438 --> 44:51.929
<i>So, what do you think
about all this, Charley?</i>

44:52.356 --> 44:53.346
<i>What do you mean?</i>

44:54.150 --> 44:55.607
<i>You know, working the backside...</i>

44:56.110 --> 44:57.692
surrounded by horse shit.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.063
Being here in the asshole of nowhere.

45:03.492 --> 45:04.858
I like working the horses.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.572
And we need the money, so...

45:09.999 --> 45:14.585
Hey, you should do something else
before there's nothing else you can do.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.046
Shit, I used to like horses,
too, you know.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.626
Now sometimes I feel like
I wanna punch myself in the face

45:22.720 --> 45:24.052
if I ever see a horse again.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.008
Got the good stuff.

45:41.697 --> 45:44.986
I'm okay. I think I'm gonna
make a phone call if that's all right.

45:45.785 --> 45:47.492
Yeah, why don't you go get
something to eat, too?

45:48.204 --> 45:51.038
- I know you must be hungry.
- I just don't have any money.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.200
Well, shit, I could pay you right now.

45:57.213 --> 45:58.203
Are you sure?

45:58.464 --> 46:01.957
Hey, any day I make more than I spend
on these goddamn horses

46:02.051 --> 46:03.337
is a good day in my book.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.588
Bon appÃ©tit.

46:09.934 --> 46:10.924
Thanks.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.009
All right, well...

46:14.146 --> 46:15.136
See you guys later.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.107
- Can you wake him?
<i>- No, he needs his sleep.</i>

46:19.193 --> 46:20.149
All right, but he got my note?

46:20.236 --> 46:21.568
<i>Yes, I told him.</i>

46:21.654 --> 46:23.270
Okay. Yeah, no, as long as he got my...

46:23.364 --> 46:24.275
<i>- Okay, Charley.</i>
- Thank you.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.827
<i>Operator.</i>

46:35.167 --> 46:36.624
Hi, I'm looking for a number.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.668
Um, for Margy Thompson.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.287
<i>Which county?</i>

46:40.673 --> 46:43.131
Yeah, no, she lives
in Rock Springs, Wyoming.

46:45.261 --> 46:46.672
<i>I'm sorry, there's no listing for her.</i>

46:47.179 --> 46:48.169
There's no one at all?

46:48.723 --> 46:49.713
<i>No.</i>

46:50.182 --> 46:51.969
Maybe if you check under Margaret.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.342
<i>Okay.</i>

46:54.937 --> 46:56.053
Can you check that?

46:56.731 --> 46:59.064
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry, nothing's coming up.</i>

46:59.150 --> 47:00.891
Okay. Never mind.

47:06.991 --> 47:09.699
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Oh, I didn't order that.

47:09.785 --> 47:10.946
That's on the house.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.702
Thank you very much.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.654
He don't look that bad yet.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.732
He looks like
he's walking on nails to me.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.072
You don't think
he's navicular, do you?

47:54.372 --> 47:55.362
I don't know.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.155
I don't think so.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.877
We'll see how he goes down at Grants Pass.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.756
You think
he'll be rested enough by then?

48:06.842 --> 48:10.210
He's gonna have to be.
I'm not wasting my good horses down there.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.889
Tell you one thing, if I had a gun,
I'd probably shoot him right now.

48:15.518 --> 48:16.554
But he just won.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.886
And you raced him too hard.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.595
Listen, kid, things are changing.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.524
The race meet starts soon,
and we're gonna have a lot to do,

48:24.610 --> 48:26.397
so we can't fuck around, you got that?

48:28.072 --> 48:29.483
Let's load up and get back.

48:35.121 --> 48:36.737
Like I said, Charley, he's not a pet.

48:37.373 --> 48:38.409
He's just a horse.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.369
Charley!

49:18.456 --> 49:19.822
- Hey, where's my dad?
- Hey.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.199
We tried calling you at the house.
Where you been?

49:22.293 --> 49:24.080
- Has he gone home?
- Listen, come with me.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.912
- Where the hell is he?
- Um...

49:27.673 --> 49:29.790
Why don't you go have a seat
in his room over here?

49:30.926 --> 49:31.916
Okay.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.591
- Is he with you?
- I'm gonna be right back, okay?

49:35.681 --> 49:36.671
Just give me a minute.

49:49.778 --> 49:50.768
Charley.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.814
I'm really sorry, but he didn't make it.

49:54.658 --> 49:55.694
What do you mean, he didn't make it?

49:55.784 --> 49:58.322
Okay, so that cut that was in his bowel,

49:59.121 --> 50:00.953
there was one that didn't
show up on the X-ray,

50:01.040 --> 50:03.783
and so that became septic.
And then his organs...

50:05.127 --> 50:07.665
- I don't understand.
- Okay. I'm really sorry.

50:11.050 --> 50:15.636
Listen, he wasn't in any pain.
He was asleep when it happened.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.890
You said he was okay two days ago.

50:21.310 --> 50:22.926
Okay, I need you to give me a number
of somebody...

50:23.020 --> 50:24.727
I wouldn't have gone if he wasn't okay.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.180
Charley, listen.
Do you have someone I can call...

50:27.274 --> 50:28.515
You said he was asleep.

50:28.859 --> 50:32.523
- Did he get my note, or was he asleep?
- Um... I'm sorry, Charley,

50:32.738 --> 50:34.479
but I need to call someone for you.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.408
- Just give me a number.
- There is nobody.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.151
Okay.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.197
Okay. Um, well, we can figure this out.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.532
I'm gonna go talk to Family Services.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.788
You stay here. I'm gonna get a phone.

51:08.983 --> 51:09.973
Charley!

51:11.235 --> 51:12.225
Charley!

51:12.903 --> 51:15.236
Leave me alone!

52:48.749 --> 52:51.207
...a <i>nd a good start
for Easy Gainer down towards the inside,</i>

52:51.293 --> 52:53.501
<i>Dander showing good speed.
Wide Eyed Willy...</i>

53:00.636 --> 53:04.380
<i>...down to these two... photo finish!
Might have been Easy Gainer.</i>

53:05.057 --> 53:08.471
<i>Well, folks, that does close out the show
for the exhibition day races.</i>

53:08.560 --> 53:11.223
<i>But don't forget, opening day
is coming up tomorrow,</i>

53:11.313 --> 53:13.100
<i>and it's gonna be one heck of a day.</i>

53:13.190 --> 53:16.809
<i>First post time is at 11 o'clock a.m.,
and races going throughout the day.</i>

53:16.902 --> 53:19.736
<i>We can't wait to see you
for opening day at Portland Downs.</i>

53:53.105 --> 53:54.437
Tomorrow's a big day.

53:56.817 --> 53:59.730
I know your foot's been hurting,
and I know you lost at Grants Pass,

54:00.446 --> 54:01.653
but it's gonna be okay.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.570
I'm gonna talk to Bonnie.

54:07.494 --> 54:08.610
I'll get her to ride you.

54:11.457 --> 54:13.289
I know she'll help us.

54:16.545 --> 54:17.535
Here we are.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.872
Here. You want one?

54:23.010 --> 54:24.000
There you go.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.137
You gotta try and win tomorrow.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.473
Okay? You hear me?

54:37.483 --> 54:38.473
You gotta try and win.

54:43.989 --> 54:44.979
Hey, Bonnie.

54:45.908 --> 54:48.116
Hey, Charley. Long time no see.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.573
Del put Pete in the claiming race.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.283
- I saw.
- You need to ride him.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.707
I can't, Charley.
It's already decided. It's printed.

54:57.294 --> 54:58.830
I'm riding Mr. High Pockets
in the same race.

54:58.921 --> 55:00.878
Yeah, but maybe they can swap them.

55:00.964 --> 55:02.956
- Or you can persuade Del.
- Doesn't work like that. No.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.464
Mr. High Pockets is Del's best horse,
I have to ride him. Plus I need a win.

55:07.179 --> 55:10.047
Yeah, but Pete's never gonna win
if you don't ride him.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.466
I hate to say it, but I don't think
there's much chance of him winning,

55:13.560 --> 55:14.550
even if I was riding.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.971
Well, if he doesn't win,
then he's not gonna get claimed.

55:18.065 --> 55:19.272
And if he doesn't get claimed,

55:19.650 --> 55:21.858
then he's gonna go down to Mexico.

55:22.736 --> 55:24.728
- Isn't he?
- Charley...

55:24.822 --> 55:27.235
They don't slaughter horses here,
but I know they do down there.

55:28.617 --> 55:29.698
I'm right, aren't I?

55:29.785 --> 55:31.401
If his feet are fucked,
then they're fucked.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.619
So, they're just gonna kill him?

55:34.081 --> 55:35.538
Just 'cause his feet are fucked?

55:35.624 --> 55:37.832
Like I said before,
if a racehorse isn't fast,

55:37.918 --> 55:39.284
then he's no good as a racehorse.

55:39.962 --> 55:40.998
This is the end of the line.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.670
There's no lower tracks.
It's just the way it is.

55:43.465 --> 55:44.706
Come inside, I'll get you a soda.

55:45.300 --> 55:49.010
I mean, back in the '80s it was, right?
But now people don't give a shit.

55:49.096 --> 55:51.463
They just want to sit in front
of their goddamn computer.

55:51.557 --> 55:54.846
Right. Or else they go to the fucking mall
like that's a big day out.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.060
Jeez. Buy designer jeans or something.

55:58.272 --> 56:01.731
Longacres. That was a real track, right?

56:01.817 --> 56:03.103
- Remember that place, Bonnie?
- Sure.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.651
Longacres. That's where your mom,
rest in peace,

56:05.737 --> 56:07.774
she won her first race.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.615
By the way, your mother
was a decent jock for a woman.

56:12.703 --> 56:15.446
You think you can persuade him
not to race Pete today?

56:15.539 --> 56:18.873
But even in the '90s,
it was still kind of all right.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.124
And you could trust the jocks.

56:21.670 --> 56:22.706
Not like now.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.583
The jocks are all backstabbers.

56:24.673 --> 56:27.461
No offense. I know
your daughter's a jock, too...

56:28.176 --> 56:30.133
- Want a Coke?
- Yeah, sure.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.086
Didn't you used
to go out with Gail Evans?

56:35.434 --> 56:36.424
That was a time.

56:37.644 --> 56:39.306
All right, just do your best today, okay?

56:46.653 --> 56:48.189
<i>And here's number six,
Lean On Pete,</i>

56:48.280 --> 56:50.021
<i>for trainer Del Montgomery.</i>

56:50.115 --> 56:52.152
<i>Pete's a five-year-old,
and he's had a decent year so far</i>

56:52.242 --> 56:53.574
<i>running on the fair circuit.</i>

56:53.660 --> 56:56.869
<i>He won over at Burns,
but came fourth down at Grants Pass.</i>

56:57.080 --> 56:59.572
<i>Tonight he's being ridden
byjockey JosÃ© Alfaro.</i>

57:00.542 --> 57:02.625
<i>In the number five slot
is Mr. High Pockets.</i>

57:02.711 --> 57:04.577
<i>He'll be ridden byjockey Bonnie Durand.</i>

57:04.963 --> 57:07.046
<i>Del Montgomery also trains this runner.</i>

57:07.841 --> 57:10.379
<i>An interesting long shot
could be More Money Honey.</i>

57:10.594 --> 57:12.460
<i>She's 14 to 1 right now.</i>

57:12.554 --> 57:14.045
All right, just win
the fucking race, Bonnie.

57:14.139 --> 57:17.223
<i>As the horses get set
to come onto the track for the next race.</i>

57:20.896 --> 57:23.013
<i>Folks, just a couple
of minutes to post time</i>

57:23.106 --> 57:24.972
<i>as the horses make their way
toward the starting gate.</i>

57:25.567 --> 57:27.809
<i>Heavy favorite right now
is Excessive Jubilation.</i>

57:27.903 --> 57:30.111
<i>Still got a few minutes left
to make your wagers.</i>

57:32.282 --> 57:34.444
<i>More Money Honey will be next.</i>

57:35.327 --> 57:37.740
<i>Mr. High Pockets
and Bonnie Durand in gate five.</i>

57:38.580 --> 57:40.822
<i>And finally, Lean On Pete.</i>

57:41.750 --> 57:42.581
<i>They're in the gate.</i>

57:44.503 --> 57:45.619
- Come on, Bonnie.
<i>- And the race is on.</i>

57:45.712 --> 57:46.953
Get him out front.

57:47.047 --> 57:50.256
<i>A very good start for Mr. High Pockets,
who goes right out to the front.</i>

57:50.342 --> 57:52.254
<i>Mr. Rear Tidal Wave in the second spot.</i>

57:52.344 --> 57:54.210
<i>Here's Excessive Jubilation,
who's away in third.</i>

57:54.304 --> 57:55.715
<i>With a hundred yards to go,</i>

57:55.806 --> 57:58.298
<i>it's all Mr. High Pockets...</i>

58:03.772 --> 58:05.354
<i>Excessive Jubilation finished up third,</i>

58:06.525 --> 58:08.858
<i>Lean On Pete finished last.</i>

58:16.660 --> 58:20.119
<i>So, folks, that does close out the show
for live racing here at Portland Downs.</i>

58:20.664 --> 58:22.200
<i>We thank you forjoining us tonight.</i>

58:22.290 --> 58:23.826
<i>Please drive home safely.</i>

58:24.251 --> 58:25.241
<i>Good night, everyone.</i>

58:34.928 --> 58:35.918
Bonnie.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.639
You see me win?
I won twice. Fucking twice!

58:40.058 --> 58:42.220
I'm gonna buy you a beer, okay?
I want us to buy Pete.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.385
You can ride him,
and I can take care of him.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.012
Yeah, let's do it!

58:46.606 --> 58:47.767
No, I'm being serious.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.265
I'm sure you are.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.726
Charley. Get over here.

58:53.655 --> 58:54.862
I need you to pick up the truck.

58:56.283 --> 58:57.273
Why?

58:57.659 --> 59:00.072
Hook up the small trailer.
We gotta load Pete in tonight.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.361
Where's he going?

59:03.081 --> 59:04.071
I'm selling him.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.162
I'll buy him.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.207
What? With what money?

59:11.298 --> 59:13.164
And where are you gonna keep him?
Not in my stalls.

59:13.592 --> 59:16.084
I don't want him going to Mexico.
He's a good horse.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.252
Oh.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.672
Go get the fucking truck.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.551
What the fuck are you waiting for? Now!

59:31.943 --> 59:33.650
Charley,
you don't want that beer?

59:43.330 --> 59:45.538
Don't worry, it's okay.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.661
Del's selling Pete.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:28.831
He told me to load him up
and park him in the lot.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:29.998
Sign here.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.501
Thanks.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.463
And what can I get for you?

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:06.962
Um...

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.679
I'd like a, uh... 27 regular, please.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:11.930
Sure thing, honey.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.298
Hey, what are you looking for?

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.753
You better not be eating anything.

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:14.214
I mean it.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.162
You need a minute?

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:11.169
Um... I don't think so, uh...

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:17.430
could I get the chicken-fried steak dinner
with baked potato and soup

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:20.303
and a large Coke? And then, um...

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:22.176
could I have two cheeseburgers to go?

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:24.553
You're hungry.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.139
Shit.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.225
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:42.010
Hey.
You forgot to pay for that, huh?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.341
Get off of me.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.018
- I don't have any money.
- You don't have any money?

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.141
What a surprise.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:50.180
<i>Sherriff's office.</i>

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.063
Yeah, put me on to the sheriff.
This is Mitch, down at the Apple Peddler.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.073
Whoa! No. You sit down.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.953
What's your name, huh?

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.122
Yeah, hello? Yeah.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.375
Yeah, we got a dine-and-dash down here.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:12.452
Yeah, I want him down here now.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.039
- Bus just showed up.
- Okay.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.795
- How many?
- Twenty or so.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.421
Driver wants to talk to you.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:20.502
You don't let him leave.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.515
Stealing from a waitress
is pretty low.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:32.225
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:36.227
I was just hungry,
and I spent all my money on gas.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.519
Where are you headed?

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.234
- Wyoming.
- Why?

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.993
My aunt used to live there,
and I'm trying to find her.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.198
Maybe the sheriff can help you find her.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.872
I can't go with the sheriff.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.157
Why?

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.658
Because I can't.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.254
There's 28 of them.
They all want food.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:57.331
I don't know what to do.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.752
Not gonna leave him alone in the office,
but we only got 45 minutes

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:03.462
till those people are on a bus
back to Winnemucca.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:05.171
I shouldn't say this,
but just let him go.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.344
What? Are you kidding me?

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.551
- You saw how much food he ordered?
- Just let him go.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.569
Fuck. Come on.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:30.197
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.546
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.466
Hey.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.637
Don't worry, don't worry.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:30.674
It's gonna be okay.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:32.634
Shh.

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:43.353
Pete, hey.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:47.649
It's okay.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.319
Hey, hey, hey...

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.888
Don't worry, it's okay.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:16.937
It's okay, it's just a car.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:18.768
Don't worry, you're fine.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.475
Hey, hey!

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.276
Hey! Hey! It's okay.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:24.478
Hey! It's okay. Come on.

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:27.030
It's okay. You're okay, Pete. It's okay.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.150
Come on, Pete. It's okay.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.485
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:32.615
Good boy.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:48.669
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:56.848
I was just thinking about, uh...

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:01.064
my friend back in Spokane.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.187
He was called Colin,
and he was a linebacker.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:10.737
He used to invite me over to his house,

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:12.700
which was pretty cool.

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.454
First time I went over there...

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.325
Well, see, he had three sisters,

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:22.001
and we were all sitting
by the kitchen table.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.704
This big kitchen table.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.050
We just ate breakfast,

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.670
and they just laughed and talked and...

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:33.718
they liked each other.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:36.925
He...

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.478
His mother was there, too,
and she had this bathrobe

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:41.476
and she...

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.685
she would make pancakes,
and, Pete, I love pancakes.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.729
It was the nicest place I've ever seen.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:16.215
<i>I thought about calling
Colin and his family</i>

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.267
after what happened...

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:24.936
with Dad, but... I didn't.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.108
I thought about calling a bunch of people
from Spokane, too.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.403
The truth is,

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.826
I don't mind telling you this,

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.697
I didn't wanna beg for anything.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:42.824
And I didn't...

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:46.787
I didn't want them to know
what I was living like.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:56.756
If they ever thought of me,
I'd rather them think of me as being okay.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:01.010
Playing football and hanging out with Dad.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.976
I'd rather them never see me again
than see me like this.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:21.826
<i>Me and Margy,</i>

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.119
<i>we used to go camping all the time</i>

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:27.294
<i>whenever my dad
needed time to himself and...</i>

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.838
<i>there was this one time we just</i>

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.880
sat around a fire,
and there was no one around.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.172
Just the trees and the mountains and...

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.799
we counted the stars,

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.592
and we tried to name them.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.601
And then eventually the...

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:56.357
eventually, the fire,
it started going out.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:00.660
And so we started to lie down
and get ready for bed and...

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:04.160
eventually, we were lying down,
and we were both kind of scared.

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.242
And, um...

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:09.203
And that's when Margy sat up,
and she said,

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.538
"Is it all right if we just left?

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.166
It's getting spooky,
and I'm just kind of scared."

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:18.220
And I was young, so I said, "I am, too."

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.013
And we went back to her house.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:24.977
And we just stayed up
watching TV all night.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.850
And we camped there
the rest of the weekend.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.272
Just watching TV.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.405
I think that...

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.033
I think that she must
have a nice house and...

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.701
if we went, as long as
we behaved ourselves,

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.285
she'd let us stay, too.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.587
I think so.

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:48.384
Yep?

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:52.105
Oh, fuck me.
Are you all right, kid? You look awful.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.307
My truck broke down on the highway.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.359
- How did you get all the way out here?
- I walked.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.607
You should not be walking
in the fucking desert.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.609
My horse needs water.
Do you mind if I get some?

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:04.113
- Who's that?
- It's a kid with a horse.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.911
What kind of horse?

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:08.158
He's a racehorse.

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:09.785
- Like, a "racehorse," racehorse?
- Yeah.

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:11.825
No shit.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:18.332
- What's the horse's name?
- Pete.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.592
That ain't much
of a name for a horse.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.926
There's a phone on the microwave in there

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.506
if you wanna call somebody
about your truck.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:29.551
Dude, that's my controller.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.261
- Oh, yeah.
- Man, I was racing.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:32.721
Oh, I bet you were.
That what you call it?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.977
- I was racing!
- You call it racing?

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:35.898
What do you call it?

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:38.477
I thought you were just twiddling
with your little fiddle over there.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.943
See, this is why
they don't let you drive...

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.613
The line's busy.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.118
Where were you taking
the horse to?

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:52.991
Wyoming.

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.242
Why?

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.002
I'm supposed to drop him off.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.000
You're in a world
of shit then, aren't you?

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.206
Yeah, I guess.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.962
You can use my phone
until you find someone.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.168
I'm Mike, that there is Dallas.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.673
Friendly fire.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:05.594
I'm Charley.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.640
Drink some fucking water, Charley.
I don't need you dying in my kitchen.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.472
All right, man...

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.853
- Hey
- Whoa!

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:22.645
All right!

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.941
Giddup. Giddup.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.538
Stubborn fucker, this guy.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.574
Maybe he just doesn't wanna be ridden.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.580
Course he does, kid. He's a horse.

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:39.500
Hiyah! Come on. Let's go.

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:43.128
Hey, be careful of his foot.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:44.834
Foot's fine, kid.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.054
- Let's go.
- You gonna get on him next?

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.766
- I've never ridden a horse before.
- Really?

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:55.679
Well, Mike will teach you what to do.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.769
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.360
He's just not for riding.
Not by me at least.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.982
Sloppy Joes have arrived!

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.939
Sloppy Joes!

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:08.324
Sloppy Joes are here.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.240
Hey, who is that?

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.446
That's Mr. Kendall.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.664
Oh hey, and Laurie, too.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.249
Come on, Charley!

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.925
So, what's it like being back?

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.169
I'm not sure.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.130
You boys...

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:33.758
you done us a good service over there.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:36.469
Well, we done something all right.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.310
We had a buddy
who lost both his legs and...

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:46.730
got a concussion so bad
he couldn't talk anymore.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:48.277
Another one had to shoot a guy.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.821
Said the head just blew off.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.786
Body just stood there for a while
before it fell to the ground.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.782
Tell him about the girl.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.617
Oh, we saw this truck get blown up.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.452
This girl...

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.296
she just got blown in half.

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:05.790
Like, cut in two.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:07.542
Split right here.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.424
That was seriously fucked up.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.510
Yep.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:21.272
But you gotta do what you gotta do, right?

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.035
Food's ready!

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:44.295
That's us.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.417
Let's eat.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:51.252
<i>What about you, kid?</i>

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.171
<i>What about me?</i>

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.380
<i>Are you gonna...</i>

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.551
join the army like these boys?
Serve your country?

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.850
I guess I hadn't really thought about it.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:02.180
Laurie, get me another beer.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.017
- You boys want another beer?
- I'm good.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.482
Jesus Christ, if that girl
gets any bigger,

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:09.983
she's not gonna get up the stairs.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.982
I had to put a shower in downstairs.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.155
She couldn't get in the fucking tub.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.070
Last week I caught her

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.827
eating a whole goddamn bag
of Snickers in her room.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:23.001
- You know that's not true.
- A whole goddamn bag. It is so true.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.503
You get so ugly when you drink, Grandpa.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:26.579
You wanna see ugly?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.547
You really wanna see ugly?

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:33.799
You're lucky you got someone
looking after you, Mr. Kendall.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.091
Yeah.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:40.973
- You're probably right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:47.309
You want me to help dry?

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:49.769
If you want.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:55.866
I like your belt.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.246
It's my dad's.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.374
I like the pictures.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:06.916
Every time he'd go somewhere
for more than six months,

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.496
he'd get something added to it.

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.958
From the looks of it,
he must have moved around a lot.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.710
Yeah, I guess.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:17.547
Thanks.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.855
Can I ask you a question?

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:32.900
Why do you let him treat you like that?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.366
I don't have anywhere else to go.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:42.280
And...

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:45.291
when you don't have anywhere else to go,

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:47.744
you're kind of stuck.

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.383
You want some ice cream?

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.961
I think Mike's got some in the freezer.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.176
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.090
Yeah, sure.

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.220
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:09.649
Get in the goddamn car.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:11.188
Thank you for dinner.

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.118
You get her number, Charley?

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:32.838
Lost your chance.

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:35.042
<i>Operator.</i>

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:37.752
<i>Hi, could you connect
me to Rock Springs, Wyoming?</i>

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:38.836
<i>It's a bar.</i>

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.763
It's called Scottish Sam's, I think.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.056
<i>One moment, please.</i>

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:43.132
Thank you.

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.051
<i>Please hold.</i>

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:51.478
- Um, hi, I'm looking for Margy Thompson.
<i>- Who?</i>

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:55.528
Yeah, I think she worked there
a few years back and... maybe longer.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.321
<i>Sorry, she doesn't work here.</i>

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:58.898
<i>And I don't know her.</i>

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:01.822
Would anyone else know?

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:03.778
<i>I don't know, Dwaine might know.</i>

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.288
All right. When will Dwaine be in?

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.207
<i>He'll be back in a couple minutes.</i>

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:12.379
- Yeah. Could I get your phone number?
<i>- Yeah, 565...</i>

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.832
Just gotta keep going.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.123
This isn't our home, Pete, come on.

01:24:58.635 --> 01:24:59.625
This isn't our home.

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:04.298
Gotta keep going. Come on.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.301
Come on.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.233
You're okay, you're okay.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.657
I used to have a picture of my mom,

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:12.122
but I threw it away one night
when I was mad.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.044
Her name was Nancy,
and she had real black hair,

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.246
and she was real tall.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:22.884
When I was born,
I stayed with her, but then

01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:26.504
she left me with my dad for a week
and never came back.

01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:31.475
He said he didn't know why she left.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:34.269
But, when I was little,
I'd always ask about it.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:39.275
And he'd never say anything,
but then, one night, when he was drunk,

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:43.814
he told me that she was
the moodiest person he's ever met.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:49.741
He said that she'd walk in the room,
and he'd swear she was a different person.

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:55.329
That she'd be mean one hour,
and then nice the next.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:26:59.996
Sounds a bit like Del,
if you ask me, right?

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:06.836
And then he said to me...

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.965
"Charley, I ain't gonna lie to you.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:15.307
She hasn't called or sent a card,
but I know deep down she loves you.

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:19.816
She's just fucked up in the head
and likes to party too much.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.564
I know it's hard to hear,
but it's a good thing she's gone."

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:30.151
Then he said to me...

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:35.574
he said, "I ain't worth shit,
but I like being here with you."

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:53.132
It's okay.

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.353
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

01:27:58.690 --> 01:27:59.680
I promise.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:30.586
Hey, it's okay.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:33.805
It's okay, don't worry. It's okay.

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:40.434
It's just a car. Oh, it's motorcycles.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:44.729
Hey, you're okay. You're okay. Hey! Hey!

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.153
Shit! Pete! Shit.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.571
Slow down, Pete!

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.531
Come on! Hey!

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.575
Hey! Pete!

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:54.819
Watch out!

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:08.917
Hey, hey, hey...

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.626
you're okay.

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:14.384
You're okay, you're okay.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.550
I'm so sorry.

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:21.517
I'm so sorry.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.598
You're gonna be okay.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.058
You're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:26.642
I promise, I promise.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.240
Where's your family?

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:24.325
My family?

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.911
- What's your name?
- My name is Charley Thompson.

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:29.334
Okay, Charley, where did you used to live?

01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:34.006
Portland. I lived in Spokane before that.
And Green River before that.

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:36.052
- Fine. Where you heading?
- Wyoming.

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:39.341
- What's in Wyoming?
- My Aunt Margy's in Wyoming.

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:41.384
- So, you're a runaway?
- No.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:44.429
Well, okay, Charley,
where are your parents?

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:46.017
I don't have any parents.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.517
All right, listen.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.361
We're gonna take you in,
we're gonna get you cleaned up.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.983
We're gonna fix everything.

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:57.488
But just, please,
tell me whose horse this is.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.401
Officer!

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.446
Charley,
why don't you wait in the truck?

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.539
It's warm in there.

01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:04.317
Help the homeless.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:46.104
What's your name?

01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:49.942
Charley.

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.991
Harley? Harley?

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:54.780
Charley.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.622
When did you get into town?
I haven't seen you here before.

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:00.869
I'm Silver.

01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:07.334
How old are you?

01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:10.425
Can you not talk?

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.464
I'm 18.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.970
I just got into town yesterday.

01:36:15.061 --> 01:36:16.051
Shit.

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:17.469
Newbie.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.437
So, where are you sleeping?

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:21.940
Colfax.

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:23.016
Fuck!

01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:27.480
Hey, that's no good.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.191
There's nothing but junkies around there.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.533
You get fucking raped
and murdered off Colfax.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:41.418
- I can look after myself.
- Yeah?

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:45.797
All right, well that's your choice.

01:36:49.429 --> 01:36:50.670
<i>Utah.</i>

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:51.879
Idaho.

01:36:52.598 --> 01:36:53.588
Uh...

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.390
Montana. We were in Montana

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:58.810
for, like, I don't know,
six weeks. It was great.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:36:59.886
Want to go to Alaska,

01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:01.472
but I don't know
if this thing will make it.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.558
Are you sure she won't mind me staying?

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:05.142
Martha? Nah.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:09.112
She's got a brother she hasn't seen
in a long time about your age.

01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:12.737
No worries.

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:14.325
Hey, we got a guest.

01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:16.612
You can go ahead and put that there.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.288
Come on in, check it out.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.119
Charley, Martha.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.371
- Hey.
- Martha, Charley.

01:37:24.047 --> 01:37:25.037
Go on.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:28.920
Fix this door.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.388
Hey, do you guys think
I could get a job around here?

01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.089
I'd do anything.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.059
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:43.483 --> 01:37:47.568
There's a lot of jobs
around here for homeless kids.

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:50.069
I'm not homeless.

01:37:52.158 --> 01:37:57.825
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but that is exactly what you are.

01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:08.251
Anyway, there's no jobs around here.

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:12.918
Ask the Mexicans.

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:16.801
They're the only ones
that seem to get jobs.

01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:20.384
See, she talks.

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:39.615
Could I borrow your phone?

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.617
Sorry, man.

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:56.261
Hey, would you guys
mind if I borrowed your phone?

01:38:56.931 --> 01:38:58.593
I just need to make a quick phone call.

01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:01.178
All right. There you go.

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:02.385
- Thank you so much.
- Just one call?

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:03.719
Are you gonna stay right here?

01:39:03.813 --> 01:39:06.977
Yeah, I'll just stay right here.
Uh, just one phone call, okay?

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.896
<i>Yeah, this is Scottish Sam's.</i>

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:16.073
Hi, Dwaine? Is this Dwaine?

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:19.947
This is Charley Thompson.
I'm calling for Margy Thompson.

01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:21.619
I heard that you might know who she is.

01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:23.576
<i>Well, sure, I know her.</i>

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:26.284
<i>Well, I knew her. She ain't here though.</i>

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.251
Do you know where she is?

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.334
<i>Yeah, she got married
and, uh, moved to Laramie.</i>

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.208
Do you know who she got married to?

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:38.303
<i>A guy named Steve.
He was a chemical salesman.</i>

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:40.756
<i>Uh, you know, she was working
at the library there in Laramie.</i>

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:43.342
Um, do you know what library she works at?

01:39:44.437 --> 01:39:45.973
<i>I don't know.
There's probablyjust the one.</i>

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:47.888
Okay. Have a good day.

01:39:48.357 --> 01:39:49.347
<i>All right.</i>

01:40:01.412 --> 01:40:02.402
Hi.

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:03.695
What do you want?

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:05.747
I heard you might be hiring.

01:40:06.209 --> 01:40:07.245
From who?

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:10.499
From the Mexicans at the mission.
I'm looking for work.

01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:11.795
You ever paint houses before?

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:15.670
Uh, we moved around a lot,
my dad and I, and we painted...

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.501
- How old are you?
- I'm 16.

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:19.673
- You ever been to jail?
- No.

01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:21.546
What's your name?

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:23.180
Del Montgomery.

01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:55.372
Everything okay?

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:57.507
Yeah. Thanks.

01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.681
Check this out! Hey, Dad!

01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:15.392
Over here!

01:41:43.472 --> 01:41:44.883
You'll get more once you do a full week.

01:41:44.974 --> 01:41:45.964
Thanks.

01:42:19.675 --> 01:42:22.292
- Hey, is he okay?
- No, um...

01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:24.002
No, he's, uh...

01:42:26.515 --> 01:42:29.007
...not good when he's drunk.

01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:32.094
So, if he doesn't pass out,
you should leave.

01:42:32.897 --> 01:42:33.887
Okay?

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:41.899
- Want any help with anything?
- No. Mmm-mmm.

01:42:42.198 --> 01:42:43.109
You sure?

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.156
Yeah.

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:46.949
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:27.490
- You cocksucking little fuck!
- What the fuck, Silver?

01:43:27.576 --> 01:43:29.818
Thieving, good-for-nothing bitch!

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:32.370
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.072
- Get the fuck off me!
- Drinking our water!

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:36.374
- Huh? Eating our food!
- Get off me, man!

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.873
- No!
- I want my fucking money!

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:41.330
- I don't have any fucking money, man!
- Bullshit!

01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:43.507
- I don't have any!
- Bullshit!

01:43:43.592 --> 01:43:46.130
Hey, you got a job! I know you did!

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:49.213
- That means you got fucking money!
- I don't have any fucking money!

01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:50.717
I didn't get paid!

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.347
- Martha, grab his fucking arms!
- Get the fuck off me, man!

01:43:55.438 --> 01:43:58.021
- Where's the money?
- Leave him alone, please!

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:02.605
- Give me your fucking leg.
- Get the fuck off, man!

01:44:02.695 --> 01:44:04.527
I bet you hid it
in your socks, little shit!

01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:06.400
Get the fuck off of me.

01:44:08.617 --> 01:44:10.574
- Leave him alone!
- You little fucking liar!

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:12.072
- What are you gonna do?
- Give me my money!

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:13.950
- Fucker.
- Please stop!

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.994
Get the fuck out of here.

01:44:20.296 --> 01:44:21.707
Give me my money!

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.581
Give me my money!

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.423
Get the hell out of here,
Charley! Just get out!

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.467
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:02.645
Give me my fucking money back!

01:46:02.731 --> 01:46:05.064
Fuck!

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:08.184
Come on!

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:11.530
- Give it back!
- What the fuck?

01:46:11.615 --> 01:46:13.277
No!

01:46:13.826 --> 01:46:15.192
Jesus Christ!

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:18.279
You...

01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:32.717
Get out! Get out!

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:34.544
- This is my fucking money.
- Get the fuck out!

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:36.045
I'm sorry.

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.147
<i>We want
to invite all passengers</i>

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:31.692
<i>to board for Laramie, Wyoming,
from platform two.</i>

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:34.772
<i>That's platform two
for Laramie, Wyoming. Thank you.</i>

01:48:24.289 --> 01:48:25.905
- Want me to take that?
- Thanks.

01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:12.553
Charley?

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:14.597
What...

01:50:17.152 --> 01:50:18.142
Oh...

01:50:36.922 --> 01:50:38.163
Feeling any better?

01:50:40.759 --> 01:50:41.875
Oh. I don't know.

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.519
I felt really... guilty

01:50:53.605 --> 01:50:56.143
not keeping better contact
with you and your dad

01:50:56.233 --> 01:50:59.476
after what happened between him and me.

01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:03.354
I'm sorry.

01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:05.231
I tried once.

01:51:05.659 --> 01:51:06.649
But...

01:51:07.911 --> 01:51:08.901
You tried?

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:11.071
Yeah, of course I tried.

01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:13.998
You're my little Charley.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.450
Course I tried.

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:26.711
Can I ask you a question?

01:51:28.265 --> 01:51:29.255
Sure.

01:51:37.774 --> 01:51:41.142
Would it be all right
to stay here for a little bit, um...

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:43.902
as long as your husband says that's okay.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.656
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

01:51:52.456 --> 01:51:53.788
And there's no more husband.

01:51:55.083 --> 01:51:56.073
Not anymore.

01:51:58.503 --> 01:51:59.710
You stay as long as you want.

01:52:01.256 --> 01:52:02.246
You and me.

01:52:08.597 --> 01:52:09.929
Can you eat some more pancakes?

01:52:10.182 --> 01:52:11.718
You used to have a really good appetite.

01:53:12.577 --> 01:53:13.658
Yeah?

01:53:13.745 --> 01:53:14.986
Is it okay if I come in?

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.867
Yeah, Charley, come in.

01:53:18.292 --> 01:53:19.203
Are you sure?

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:20.329
Yeah, come on in.

01:53:20.877 --> 01:53:21.867
Okay.

01:53:24.256 --> 01:53:25.542
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:30.843
If you wanna kick me out in, like,
a week or so, you can.

01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:33.137
I'm not gonna kick you out.

01:53:34.182 --> 01:53:36.765
No, but if you want to,
I won't feel bad about it.

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:38.968
I'll be okay.

01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:41.595
That's fair.

01:53:45.444 --> 01:53:48.937
But maybe if I do get to stay,
then I can finish up my school here?

01:53:50.198 --> 01:53:51.905
You have to go to school, it's the law.

01:53:54.995 --> 01:53:57.829
Maybe I'd get to play football
if I get back to school.

01:53:57.914 --> 01:53:58.904
Of course.

01:54:03.545 --> 01:54:05.537
And the other thing is,
if I have to go to jail,

01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:07.747
do you think that
I'd get to come back here?

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:09.961
You're not going to jail.

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.043
But if you did, yes.

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:14.587
Okay.

01:54:19.728 --> 01:54:21.014
You need to go to sleep.

01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:24.555
Get some rest.

01:54:31.198 --> 01:54:32.484
I get nightmares.

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:38.778
About my dad.

01:54:42.918 --> 01:54:43.908
About...

01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:46.873
Pete sometimes.

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:54.631
Just that he's drowning,
and that I can't save him.

01:55:02.437 --> 01:55:05.350
I just get really sad sometimes,
I can't save him.

01:55:09.486 --> 01:55:11.273
It's okay, Charley.

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.236
- I'm here now.
- Mm-hmm.

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:19.326
And the nightmares...

01:55:20.705 --> 01:55:22.116
- are gonna get better.
- Yeah?

01:55:22.207 --> 01:55:23.948
They might not go away completely,

01:55:24.334 --> 01:55:25.870
but they're gonna get better.

01:55:27.087 --> 01:55:28.623
The more good times you have.

01:55:30.841 --> 01:55:32.878
And we're gonna have good times, Charley.

01:55:34.803 --> 01:55:35.793
Yeah.

01:55:38.223 --> 01:55:39.213
Promise.

01:55:44.354 --> 01:55:45.970
I just miss him a lot.

01:55:48.984 --> 01:55:51.567
I miss him so much.
