WEBVTT

00:22.756 --> 00:24.592
( paper clatters )

00:46.514 --> 00:50.017
( laughs )
SO WAS THAT SO HARD?

00:50.118 --> 00:51.719
I THINK WE'RE OKAY.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.089
( door opens )

00:55.189 --> 00:57.758
( door closes )

00:59.927 --> 01:02.330
( theme music playing )

01:20.881 --> 01:23.617
- ARE WE GONNA
PLAY ANOTHER GAME?
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO?

01:23.717 --> 01:27.588
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU KNOW, SINCE WE MET
THE LAST TIME

01:27.688 --> 01:29.523
I'VE BEEN READING UP
ON THE RULES OF BLACKJACK.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.792
I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY RIGHT NOW.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.728
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.065
WHY'D YOU LEARN
ABOUT BLACKJACK?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.900
BECAUSE I WANT
TO UNDERSTAND MORE

01:40.000 --> 01:42.936
ABOUT THE THINGS
YOU LIKE TO DO.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.539
- WHY?
- BECAUSE...

01:45.639 --> 01:47.708
I THINK YOU'RE
A VERY INTERESTING PERSON.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.077
- HUH. I'M NOT INTERESTING.
- ( cards shuffling )

01:50.178 --> 01:52.613
WELL, I THINK YOU ARE.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.149
YOU'RE REALLY OBSERVANT,
YOU'RE PERCEPTIVE,

01:55.249 --> 01:56.884
YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR

01:56.984 --> 01:59.320
AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
EXTREMELY SMART.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.455
MY TEACHERS
DON'T THINK I'M SMART.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.525
REALLY? THEY SAY
THINGS LIKE THAT?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.030
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.700
SO WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.736
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TALK TO ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.671
- I KNOW THAT.
- I WON'T TELL MY PARENTS.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.373
- YOU'LL STILL GET PAID.
- ( chuckles )

02:19.473 --> 02:22.310
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
FORCE YOU TO TALK TO ME,

02:22.410 --> 02:24.445
BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING--

02:24.545 --> 02:27.448
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU DO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT,

02:27.548 --> 02:29.850
THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO DO IT.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.421
YOU KNOW WHY I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL?

02:33.521 --> 02:36.056
'CAUSE ALL
MY TEACHERS HATE ME.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.958
THEY HATE YOU?
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.828
I CAN'T SEE ANY REASON
WHY THEY WOULD.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.097
THEY'RE ALL MAD BECAUSE
I FALL ASLEEP IN CLASS.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.267
DOES THAT
HAPPEN A LOT?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.168
PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.037
WELL, THEN YOU MUST BE--

02:50.137 --> 02:51.472
YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.575
NO, SCHOOL IS
JUST BORING.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.812
YOU DON'T LIKE ANY
OF YOUR CLASSES?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.881
NOT REALLY.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.717
THEY'RE NOT
ABOUT REAL THINGS.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.853
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

03:05.953 --> 03:08.489
LIKE, MATH IS ALGEBRA--

03:08.589 --> 03:10.524
IT'S NOT EVEN NUMBERS,
IT'S LETTERS.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.827
- IT'S ALL FAKE.
- AND WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE OTHER CLASSES?

03:13.927 --> 03:15.529
HISTORY,
FOR EXAMPLE.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.298
- DOESN'T THAT
HAVE TO BE REAL?
- ( cards clatter )

03:17.398 --> 03:20.100
WE DON'T HAVE HISTORY--
IT'S CALLED HUMANITIES,

03:20.200 --> 03:24.305
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE
READING THIS LAME BOOK
CALLED "LORD OF THE FLIES."

03:24.405 --> 03:27.475
- HAVE YOU EVER READ IT?
- A LONG TIME AGO.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.410
IN WHAT WAY
DO YOU FIND IT LAME?

03:29.510 --> 03:31.579
THESE KIDS CRASH
ON A DESERTED ISLAND

03:31.679 --> 03:33.314
AND START DOING
MEAN THINGS.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.016
AND YOU DON'T FIND
THAT REALISTIC?

03:36.116 --> 03:39.620
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CRASH ON AN ISLAND
FOR KIDS TO BE MEAN.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.689
MMM, THAT'S TRUE.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.658
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
KIDS BE MEAN LIKE THAT?

03:51.599 --> 03:54.268
- YOU WANNA SEE
SOMETHING?
- SURE.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.370
THEY JUST GAVE
ONE OF THESE TO
EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.444
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S A TURTLE.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.046
- OH, IT'S A TURTLE. OKAY.
- YEAH.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.981
OH, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.451
DO YOU THINK HE'S OKAY
IN THERE? DO YOU WANT
TO LET HIM OUT FOR A BIT?

04:10.551 --> 04:12.453
- WELL, IS THAT OKAY?
- SURE, GO AHEAD.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.489
- OKAY.
- ON THE FLOOR.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
DO YOU HAVE
A NAME FOR HIM?

04:23.431 --> 04:26.900
NO. I HAVE TO
TAKE HIM HOME
AND TAKE CARE OF HIM.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.470
IF HE DIES,
I FAIL.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.340
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

04:32.440 --> 04:35.843
I'M GONNA
FORGET TO FEED HIM
OR LEAVE HIM BEHIND

04:35.943 --> 04:37.678
AND HE'S GONNA DIE.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.382
WELL, HE LOOKS
REALLY HEALTHY TO ME.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.517
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
DOING A GREAT JOB.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.553
I'M GLAD YOU TOOK HIM OUT
OF THAT BACKPACK, THOUGH.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.055
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
A BIT CROWDED IN THERE.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.724
YEAH, I HAVE TO TAKE
ALL MY BOOKS HOME.

04:50.824 --> 04:54.294
REALLY? YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF HOMEWORK?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.697
NO, IT'S JUST SOMETIMES
I'M AT MY DAD'S

04:56.797 --> 04:59.066
AND I FORGET A BOOK
THAT I LEFT AT MY MOM'S,

04:59.166 --> 05:01.635
SO MY DAD GETS ANGRY
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO
BACK TO BROOKLYN.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.772
SO IT'S BEST
THAT I KEEP ALL
MY BOOKS WITH ME.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.476
SO SINCE WE LAST MET,
YOU'VE BEEN STAYING AT
YOUR DAD'S APARTMENT?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.712
NO.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.247
SO YOU STILL FEEL
THE SAME WAY AS
YOU FELT BEFORE,

05:14.348 --> 05:16.350
THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT READY
TO STAY WITH YOUR DAD...

05:16.450 --> 05:18.919
- JUST YET.
- YEAH.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.154
AH. WELL,
I'M A LITTLE BIT--

05:21.254 --> 05:23.090
I'M A LITTLE BIT
CONFUSED.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.727
LAST WEEK YOU SAID THAT
THE REASON THAT YOU COULDN'T
STAY OVER AT YOUR DAD'S

05:26.827 --> 05:29.129
WAS BECAUSE
YOU COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP
BECAUSE OF THE NOISE.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.064
NOW YOU'RE WITH YOUR MOM

05:31.164 --> 05:33.901
AND YOU'RE STILL
SO TIRED YOU'RE
FALLING ASLEEP IN CLASS.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.536
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S WITH THAT?

05:35.636 --> 05:39.339
SCHOOL'S BORING.
I JUST TOLD YOU THAT.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.444
SO...

05:43.544 --> 05:45.979
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY TROUBLE--

05:46.079 --> 05:47.615
IS HE OKAY THERE?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.884
- I GUESS.
- OKAY.

05:50.984 --> 05:54.755
SO YOU NEVER HAVE
ANY TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP
AT YOUR MOM'S HOUSE?

05:56.624 --> 06:00.628
- IT'S JUST HARD
TO FALL ASLEEP.
- WELL, MAYBE THE PROBLEM

06:00.728 --> 06:02.463
ISN'T JUST THE NOISE
AT YOUR DAD'S APARTMENT.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.633
MAYBE IT'S THAT
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING FOR OTHER REASONS.

06:05.733 --> 06:10.003
- LIKE WHAT?
- WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
CAN'T GET TO SLEEP

06:10.103 --> 06:13.206
BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY
STRESSED OUT AT NIGHTTIME.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.308
THEY CAN'T EMPTY
THEIR MINDS.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.578
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S TRUE ABOUT YOU?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.747
MAYBE.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.915
I'M SURE THAT THERE'S
A LOT GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
THAT MUST BE STRESSFUL.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.686
YOU THINK?

06:26.787 --> 06:28.756
HMM?

06:30.658 --> 06:32.860
IS THERE ANYBODY
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE

06:32.960 --> 06:36.730
TALKING WITH
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.801
LIKE WHO?
MY PARENTS?

06:40.901 --> 06:44.472
WELL, THAT'S ONE
POSSIBILITY, YEAH.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.509
WELL, IF I TELL MY MOM,

06:48.609 --> 06:50.644
SHE CALLS MY DAD
AND THEN THEY ARGUE.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.983
AND WHAT KIND OF THINGS
DO THEY ARGUE ABOUT?

06:56.083 --> 07:00.420
EVERYTHING.
TODAY THEY HAD
A FIGHT BECAUSE

07:00.521 --> 07:02.523
MY MOM SAYS I'M NOT
GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP

07:02.623 --> 07:04.592
AND MY DAD SAYS
I'M NOT HEALTHY.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.794
AND WHAT DOES HE MEAN
BY THAT, "NOT HEALTHY"?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.762
FAT.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.734
HAS YOUR DAD
EVER TOLD YOU THAT
HE THINKS YOU'RE FAT?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.603
I KNOW
HE THINKS I'M FAT.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.171
EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M FAT, BECAUSE I'M FAT.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.578
SO, BEING FAT

07:24.678 --> 07:27.715
SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT REALLY BOTHERS YOU.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.688
DO YOU THINK I'M FAT?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.391
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
IS WHAT YOU THINK,

07:38.492 --> 07:41.394
AND I THINK
IT MAKES YOU UPSET

07:41.495 --> 07:43.664
JUST FROM THE WAY
YOU TALK ABOUT IT.

07:43.764 --> 07:47.034
I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S ALL THE KIDS
AT SCHOOL THAT DO.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.337
AND WHAT DO
THEY SAY TO YOU?

07:50.437 --> 07:52.806
WE'RE READING
"LORD OF THE FLIES"

07:52.906 --> 07:54.908
AND WE HAVE TO
WRITE THIS ESSAY

07:55.008 --> 07:57.377
ON THE CHARACTER
THAT WE THINK WE'RE
THE MOST LIKE.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.914
SO EVERYBODY IN THE CLASS
STARTS LAUGHING,

08:01.014 --> 08:03.884
BECAUSE THEY SAY
I SHOULD WRITE ABOUT
THE CHARACTER NAMED PIGGY,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.453
WHICH IS THE FAT CHARACTER
IN THE BOOK.

08:06.554 --> 08:10.824
SO THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL ME NOW-- PIGGY.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.327
THAT'S A PRETTY
CRUEL THING TO DO.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.463
WHATEVER.
AND LAST SATURDAY,

08:16.564 --> 08:18.766
THIS GIRL MAYA HAD
A BAT MITZVAH

08:18.866 --> 08:21.569
AND HER DAD GOT
ALL THIS CHOCOLATE
FOR THE PARTY.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.538
THIS KID ERIC TEXTS
EVERYBODY AND SAYS,

08:24.638 --> 08:26.139
"IF YOU WANT CHOCOLATE,

08:26.239 --> 08:28.041
THEN YOU'D BETTER GET THERE
BEFORE OLIVER DOES."

08:28.141 --> 08:30.510
SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL PRIZE,
THIS ERIC.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.613
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO

08:32.713 --> 08:34.682
TO THE STUPID
PARTY ANYWAY.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.283
DID YOU TELL
YOUR MOM THAT?

08:36.383 --> 08:38.518
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.487
BECAUSE SHE WOULD'VE
CALLED MY DAD

08:40.588 --> 08:42.723
AND THEN THEY WOULD'VE
HAD A FIGHT.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.859
MMM.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.361
SO YOU WENT
TO THE PARTY EVEN THOUGH
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.497
KIND OF.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.933
MY MOM DROPPED ME OFF
AND WHEN I GOT THERE

08:53.033 --> 08:55.502
I KNEW EVERYBODY WAS
UPSTAIRS IN MAYA'S ROOM,

08:55.603 --> 08:57.605
SO I SNUCK OUT
THE BACK DOOR

08:57.705 --> 08:59.773
AND HID BEHIND A BUSH.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.143
YOU HID BEHIND A BUSH
FOR THE WHOLE PARTY?

09:03.243 --> 09:06.814
IT WAS FINE TILL
EVERYBODY CAME OUTSIDE
TO PLAY IN THE SNOW.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.282
DID ANYBODY
SEE YOU OUT THERE?

09:10.684 --> 09:13.220
WELL, ERIC CAME BEHIND
THE BUSH TO TAKE A LEAK.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.488
- AND?
- HE PULLED OUT HIS DICK

09:15.589 --> 09:17.658
AND PISSED
ALL OVER MY SHOES.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.329
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

09:22.429 --> 09:25.498
AND THEN HE WENT
BACK TO HANG OUT
WITH THE OTHER KIDS

09:25.599 --> 09:27.367
AND THEY WENT
BACK INSIDE.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.637
SOUNDS PRETTY AWFUL.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.272
DID YOU TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT THIS?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.644
- NO.
- I KNOW IF
IT HAPPENED TO ME

09:36.744 --> 09:39.647
I'D FIND IT
PRETTY HARD

09:39.747 --> 09:41.982
IF I DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY
TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.854
IF I TELL MY MOM,
THEN SHE CALLS MY DAD,

09:46.954 --> 09:50.891
THEN THEY FIGHT
AND I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE MY FAULT.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.061
WHAT DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE YOUR FAULT?

09:54.161 --> 09:56.163
IF THEY GET A DIVORCE.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
AH.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.670
HAVE YOUR MOM AND DAD
TALKED TO YOU AT ALL

10:02.770 --> 10:05.773
ABOUT THE DIVORCE
SINCE LAST WEEK?

10:12.512 --> 10:14.614
THERE WAS THIS COUPLE
THAT CAME OUT

10:14.715 --> 10:17.851
OF YOUR OFFICE EARLIER.
WERE THEY MARRIED?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.921
DID THEY LOOK
MARRIED TO YOU?

10:21.021 --> 10:23.891
DO I HAVE TO GUESS?
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.059
WELL...
( clears throat )

10:26.159 --> 10:28.896
I DON'T TELL
MY OTHER PATIENTS
ABOUT YOU

10:28.996 --> 10:33.667
AND THAT MEANS
I CAN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT OTHER PATIENTS.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.636
WHY WOULD
HAPPY PEOPLE COME HERE?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.439
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
COME TO THERAPY,

10:39.539 --> 10:40.674
THEY TALK
ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL

10:40.774 --> 10:43.977
AND THEY LEAVE
JUST FEELING BETTER.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.749
CAN YOU MAKE
MY MOM AND DAD HAPPY?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.153
WHAT I CAN DO

10:53.253 --> 10:56.256
IS I CAN MAKE
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

10:56.356 --> 10:58.692
YOUR MOM,
YOUR DAD AND YOU

10:58.792 --> 11:00.894
A LITTLE BETTER...

11:03.496 --> 11:06.266
BUT I CAN'T
MAKE THEM HAPPY.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.441
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I INVITED YOUR MOM
AND DAD INTO THE ROOM?

11:15.308 --> 11:16.476
SURE.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.678
OKAY.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.353
BESS, LUKE.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.966
OH, SWEETIE,
COME OVER HERE.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.638
SO YOU SOLVE
ALL THE PROBLEMS?
ARE WE GOOD NOW?

11:45.739 --> 11:49.542
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE DISCUSSED

11:49.642 --> 11:52.813
WAS THE IMPORTANCE

11:52.913 --> 11:55.783
OF BOTH OF YOU
WORKING TOGETHER

11:55.883 --> 11:59.219
TO MAKE SURE THAT
OLIVER UNDERSTANDS

11:59.319 --> 12:00.720
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.923
WELL, YOU GOT
A PRETTY CLEAR SENSE

12:03.023 --> 12:05.258
OF HOW WELL WE ALL WORK
TOGETHER, DIDN'T YOU?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.897
IS THERE ANYTHING
THE TWO OF YOU

12:09.997 --> 12:12.532
WOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS WITH OLIVER

12:12.632 --> 12:15.168
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.878
( clears throat )

12:24.978 --> 12:26.980
( clears throat )
WELL...

12:28.148 --> 12:31.151
FIRST OF ALL YOU PROBABLY
KNOW THIS ALREADY

12:31.251 --> 12:34.021
BUT JUST IN CASE
IT ISN'T CLEAR,

12:35.355 --> 12:38.058
YOU MOM AND I HAVE DECIDED
THAT IT'S BEST FOR ALL OF US

12:38.158 --> 12:40.493
IF WE DON'T LIVE
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.464
FOR GOOD
OR FOR JUST NOW?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.068
FOR GOOD.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.907
BESS, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY?

12:57.010 --> 13:00.280
YEAH, YOUR DAD'S RIGHT--

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
FOR GOOD.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.989
OLIVER, DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS

13:09.089 --> 13:12.025
ABOUT WHAT YOUR MOM
AND DAD HAVE JUST SAID?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.363
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
JUST LIVE TOGETHER?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.102
Luke:
THERE ARE A LOT
OF REASONS FOR THAT.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.406
FOR ONE THING,
I'M SURE YOU NOTICE
HOW MUCH WE FIGHT.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.978
- BECAUSE OF ME.
- NO, SWEETIE,

13:31.078 --> 13:32.880
YOU CAN'T EVER THINK
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.382
BUT YOU GUYS
DO FIGHT ABOUT ME--

13:35.482 --> 13:38.751
- ALL THE TIME.
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.088
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,
YOU MOM AND ME,

13:41.188 --> 13:45.292
WE JUST CAN'T
GET ALONG ANYMORE.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.361
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO
GET A DIVORCE.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.564
AND WE LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.967
WE DON'T WANT
TO HAVE YOU SEE US

13:54.067 --> 13:56.236
GO AT IT
ALL THE TIME.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.407
SO YOU ARE GETTING
A DIVORCE BECAUSE OF ME.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.110
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
TO DO IT. YOU'RE ONLY
CONFUSING HIM MORE.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.213
WELL, AT LEAST
I'M TRYING OVER HERE.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.950
OLIVER...

14:11.151 --> 14:14.554
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOUR DAD IS SAYING?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.827
THEY'RE GETTING
A DIVORCE

14:20.928 --> 14:22.595
BECAUSE I GET TOO UPSET
WHEN THEY FIGHT.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.066
NO, SWEETIE,
WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT

14:26.166 --> 14:29.769
YOUR DAD AND I,
WE CAN'T STAY TOGETHER,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.604
OKAY?
BUT WE LOVE YOU.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.840
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH

14:33.941 --> 14:36.243
AND WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA
LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT HA--

14:36.343 --> 14:38.178
( crying )

14:38.278 --> 14:40.513
Luke:
THIS IS WHAT
ALWAYS HAPPENS.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.020
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.990
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.660
OLIVER, WHY DON'T YOU

14:53.760 --> 14:55.929
WAIT IN THE OTHER ROOM,

14:56.029 --> 14:57.497
MAYBE DO
SOME HOMEWORK

14:57.597 --> 15:00.133
AND WE'LL CALL YOU
IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.236
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.044
- ( door opens )
- ( sighs )

15:11.144 --> 15:14.614
( door closes )

15:14.714 --> 15:17.317
AND YOU WONDER
WHY THE KID CAN'T
FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.651
WOULD YOU STOP IT?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.788
AT LEAST
I'M LETTING MYSELF
FEEL SAD ABOUT THIS.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.157
- YOU DON'T THINK I'M SAD?
- WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE
PRIDING YOURSELF

15:24.257 --> 15:25.625
ON HOW QUICKLY
YOU CAN JUST MOVE ON.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.895
PRIDE? LOOK, I HATE
THAT ALL THIS IS HAPPENING,

15:28.996 --> 15:30.330
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR TO OUR SON

15:30.430 --> 15:32.232
WHEN YOU START CRYING
IN FRONT OF HIM.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.367
DON'T YOU THINK
I'M RIGHT ABOUT THAT, PAUL?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.370
WELL, WHAT I CAN
TELL YOU IS

15:37.470 --> 15:39.672
THAT I THINK THAT
YOUR SON'S SLEEPLESSNESS

15:39.772 --> 15:41.574
AND HIS OVEREATING

15:41.674 --> 15:43.343
IS PROBABLY CAUSED

15:43.443 --> 15:46.279
BY THE PRESSURE
THAT YOU'RE ALL UNDER.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.316
THAT'S WHAT I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN
TO HER FOR MONTHS NOW.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.654
YOU KNOW HE BELIEVES
THE DIVORCE IS
ALL HIS FAULT,

15:54.754 --> 15:58.325
AND THAT'S
ENTIRELY NATURAL.

15:58.425 --> 16:02.362
HE ALSO BELIEVES
THAT IF HE BEHAVES
IN A PARTICULAR WAY,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.963
IT'LL BRING YOU TWO
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.733
THAT'S ALSO
A NATURAL FANTASY.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.705
BUT BECAUSE THINGS ARE
SO TENSE BETWEEN YOU

16:12.805 --> 16:14.941
AT THE MOMENT,
HE FEELS THAT

16:15.042 --> 16:19.712
HE CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HIS PROBLEMS.

16:19.812 --> 16:24.584
FOR INSTANCE,
THERE'S A BOY AT SCHOOL
WHO'S BEEN PICKING ON HIM.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.123
AND OLIVER FEELS
THAT HE CAN'T SPEAK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS

16:30.223 --> 16:32.759
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.662
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
THAT HE FEELS

16:35.762 --> 16:38.565
COMPLETELY HELPLESS.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.734
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
GET DIVORCED.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.504
NO, THAT'S--

16:44.604 --> 16:47.274
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.476
BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,
ISN'T IT?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.444
I MEAN, HOW SELFISH
AND HOW COWARDLY

16:51.544 --> 16:54.013
IT IS FOR US TO JUST
THROW IN THE TOWEL

16:54.114 --> 16:57.450
AND WRECK OUR SON'S LIFE
OVER SMALL STUFF?

16:57.550 --> 17:01.354
- Luke: SMALL STUFF?
- WE'RE BOTH STUBBORN,
THAT'S ALL.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.157
WE FIGHT ABOUT
STUPID THINGS, LIKE HOW LATE
YOU COULD STAY AT WORK,

17:04.257 --> 17:06.393
HOW MY MOTHER
DRIVES YOU CRAZY.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.461
Luke: HOW MY FRIENDS
ARE A BAD INFLUENCE,
HOW I CURSE TOO MUCH,

17:08.561 --> 17:10.897
HOW EVERYTHING I DO IS
A BAD INFLUENCE ON OUR KID.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.832
AND SO WHAT?
I MEAN, REALLY, SO WHAT?

17:12.932 --> 17:16.303
WHAT, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE JUST PERFECTLY IN LOVE
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES?

17:16.403 --> 17:18.671
( chuckles )
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.973
MAYBE WE'RE
JUST GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH HERE.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.243
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF
WE JUST STAY THE COURSE?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.178
MAYBE WE'LL COME OUT
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.514
WOULDN'T THAT
BE BETTER FOR OLIVER?

17:27.614 --> 17:30.183
ISN'T THERE A WHOLE BOOK
ABOUT HOW PARENTS SHOULD

17:30.283 --> 17:32.385
STAY TOGETHER NOW MATTER
HOW UNHAPPY THEY ARE

17:32.485 --> 17:34.821
AND ULTIMATELY IT'S BETTER
FOR THE CHILDREN?

17:34.921 --> 17:36.923
THAT'S A QUESTION
THAT I THINK

17:37.023 --> 17:40.059
A LOT OF COUPLES
STRUGGLE WITH.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.296
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS

17:43.396 --> 17:46.266
WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE THREE OF YOU.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.040
AS BAD AS IT'S BEEN
BETWEEN US,

17:54.141 --> 17:56.976
IT HASN'T BEEN ANY BETTER
NOW THAT WE'RE BROKEN UP,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.279
NOT FOR ME ANYWAY...

18:00.647 --> 18:02.115
AND ESPECIALLY
NOT FOR OLIVER.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.083
WE OWE IT TO HIM

18:04.184 --> 18:05.652
TO STOP AND THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING

18:05.752 --> 18:08.388
BEFORE WE MOVE
PAST THE POINT
OF NO RETURN HERE.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.657
I'M ALREADY
PAST THAT POINT.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.059
YOU LIKE TO SAY
THINGS LIKE THAT,
BUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.495
COME ON,
ARE YOU REALLY HAPPY

18:15.595 --> 18:18.231
LIVING ALL ALONE SO FAR
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.176
I'M SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.549
BESS. BESS, WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK AND SIT DOWN?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.318
OLIVER, PACK UP YOUR STUFF.
WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.952
Paul:
BESS, CAN YOU PLEASE--

18:40.052 --> 18:41.788
NO, I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING LEFT TO TALK ABOUT.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.423
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MY NIGHT WITH HIM.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.824
NO, HE'S NOT GONNA
GO WITH YOU.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.092
SO YOU GET TO MAKE
THAT DECISION?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.594
PLEASE.
IF YOU'LL BOTH SIT DOWN,

18:47.694 --> 18:49.128
WE CAN MAKE
THE DECISION TOGETHER.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.697
WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA GO STAY WITH HIM

18:50.797 --> 18:52.565
IF YOU'RE HAVING WOMEN
OVER AT YOUR APARTMENT.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.834
DOES OLIVER
KNOW ABOUT YOUR NEW
LITTLE GIRLFRIEND?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.673
Luke:
I GUESS HE DOES NOW.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.511
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO WANTED TO BREAK
THINGS TO HIM GENTLY.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.880
WOULD YOU TELL HIM
THAT IT'S TOO SOON

19:07.980 --> 19:10.082
FOR HIM TO START SEEING
OTHER WOMEN, THAT IT WOULD
BE BAD FOR OLIVER?

19:10.183 --> 19:13.353
BESS, I DON'T THINK WE'RE
EVER GOING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOOD OR BAD FOR OLIVER

19:13.453 --> 19:15.955
IF WHENEVER
EITHER OF YOU GET UPSET,
YOU END THE SESSION.

19:16.055 --> 19:19.392
- SO YOU'RE GONNA SKIP
YOUR CLASS AGAIN TONIGHT?
- Bess: NO, I DROPPED MY CLASS.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.461
AND IT'S A GOOD THING
I DID, BECAUSE ONE
OF US NEEDS TO BE

19:21.561 --> 19:23.062
A RESPONSIBLE PARENT
RIGHT NOW.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.964
NOW SEE?
SHE'S JUST USING
OLIVER AS AN EXCUSE.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.468
SHE'S NEVER
GONNA GET HER DEGREE,
SHE'S NEVER GONNA MOVE ON,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.870
AND SHE'S GONNA KEEP SAYING
IT'S ALL BECAUSE HE NEEDS HER,

19:30.970 --> 19:32.372
AND THAT'S
COMPLETE BULLSHIT.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.507
THE KID NEEDS
TO BE ALLOWED TO GROW UP.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.810
SON-- OLIVER THIS BAG--
IT'S A MESS.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.947
SEE? HOW IS HE EVER
GONNA GROW UP IF YOU KEEP
TREATING HIM LIKE A BABY?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.617
ISN'T IT MY NIGHT
TO GO WITH DAD?

19:47.620 --> 19:51.424
- NOT IF YOU'RE NOT READY.
- Oliver: IT'S FINE.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.526
IT'S MY NIGHT
WITH DAD AND I WANT
TO STAY WITH HIM.

19:53.626 --> 19:57.029
( sighs )
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

19:57.129 --> 19:58.731
HEY, IT'S OUR NIGHT,

19:58.831 --> 20:01.434
HE WANTS TO BE WITH ME.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.475
NO. NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.911
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.317
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH YOUR DAD, OKAY?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.353
- MMM.
- I'LL PICK YOU UP
ON THURSDAY AFTER SCHOOL.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.195
- UH, SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK, PAUL.
- Oliver: BYE, MOM.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.963
BESS.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.836
WHY DON'T YOU WALK US
TO THE TRAIN?

20:48.548 --> 20:49.782
OOF.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.453
YOU'RE GONNA
GET A BAD BACK
CARRYING ALL THIS.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.323
I CAN NEVER FIGURE OUT
WHAT I NEED.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.659
PAUL, SO LONG.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.762
NEXT TIME WE'LL STAY
FOR THE WHOLE SESSION.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.497
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.340
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A MINUTE? THANK YOU.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.547
( jazz music playing )

21:41.067 --> 21:43.336
( sighs )
