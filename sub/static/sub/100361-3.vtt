No!

00:55.805 --> 00:57.766
Suck on that, gravity.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.645
Congratulations.
I, too, am fighting gravity and winning.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.773
That's true, your boobs do look great.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.775
I'm talking about the pulley system.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.526
So, my idea worked.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.569
Like a charm.

01:09.652 --> 01:10.570
Oh.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.365
I just tie a few bath towels together
to make a rope,

01:15.033 --> 01:18.703
swing it over a bronze sculpture
that I drag in from the living room,

01:18.787 --> 01:21.122
hoist my way up to a standing position.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.582
Couldn't be easier.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.794
It could if you'd just tell Nick
you got stuck on the toilet.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.545
Oh, no. God!

01:28.171 --> 01:31.007
That image would be stuck forever
in his brain.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.220
Speaking of Nick, um...

01:35.762 --> 01:38.807
[clicks tongue] I kind of have a...
a big favor to ask you.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.891
How big?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.769
I just fireman-carried you off a commode.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.772
I was hoping you'd go to a charity benefit
with us this weekend.

01:45.855 --> 01:49.776
What are we talking? Full dinner?
Passed apps? Make your own sundae?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.528
-I don't have that information.
-I'm out.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.654
Oh, please.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.949
[exhales] It's our first event
as a couple.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.285
All Nick's friends are gonna be there...
judging me.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.496
So? Judge them right back.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.206
You sure gave me the stink eye

02:03.289 --> 02:06.292
when Sol and I went
to that Bar Association benefit.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.587
It was black tie, and you looked
like a cartoon fortune-teller.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.840
Everyone loved my outfit.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.842
And my palm readings.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.846
Look, it's been a long time since I had
to dazzle on the arm of a husband.

02:17.929 --> 02:23.601
And... let's just say, recent events
have left me feeling less than dazzling.

[Grace exhales]

02:25.770 --> 02:28.356
I need my emotional support witch.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.860
All right. But I will be telling fortunes.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.863
Go for it. Anything to draw attention
away from me.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.614
Hmm. It is short notice,

02:36.698 --> 02:40.785
but I could probably call in a few favors
and borrow a crow.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.913
I don't think you need any props.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.041
This is distraction enough.

You like Dr. Rogers.

-how cute we were...

I made it before we left.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.042
And why?

03:29.125 --> 03:33.755
It's my understanding death row inmates
are given a last meal of their choice.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.382
Aren't we catastrophizing a bit?

03:36.466 --> 03:39.302
I don't know. It's never a good sign

03:39.385 --> 03:42.680
when the nurse taking your blood pressure
says, "Uh-oh!"

We haven't even gotten
the results back yet.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.769
I've already got "uh-oh."

03:48.269 --> 03:50.605
So either I'm dying, or I'm gonna die

03:50.688 --> 03:53.566

03:53.650 --> 03:55.860
Any way you put it, dead man walking.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.447
So your great plan is to stress eat
till the doctor calls?

04:00.073 --> 04:03.701
The chickens have come home to roost.
May as well fry them.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.453
No. No frying.

Is everybody staring?
I... I feel like people are staring.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.186
Only because you look amazing,
which makes them jealous.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.397
Which is, of course,
why I go to charity events.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.858

maybe check out the silent auction?

my first business loan.

he still gave me a job.

is trying to steal my shoes?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, charity, schools.
Who's bidder number 210?

06:45.321 --> 06:47.407
I don't know. It's a silent auction.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.700
Well, can you make out that squiggle?

06:50.451 --> 06:53.996
Yeah. Uh, looks like
a little peace sign in quotes.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.290
Oh, I get it.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.377
'Cause the '60s. Funny.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.422
Is it? Or is an ironic peace sign

07:02.505 --> 07:06.634
an affront to everything
a real Deadhead stands for?

07:07.135 --> 07:11.639
Okay, 210. Here's my bid
and a little doodle for you.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.601
One middle finger. Hold the quotes.

the name of the celebrity.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.239
Sorry, dear.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.657
Blankety-blank.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.368
Died of a ham sandwich.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.371
-Oh, I hate Celebrity.
-That's because you're bad at it.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.498
I can't help it
if my dad knows everyone old

07:37.582 --> 07:39.917
and Brianna gets crazy eyes when we play.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.378
You think it's any easier
being on Bud's team?

07:42.462 --> 07:46.382
I see you're counting down the minutes
till the Hansons win again.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.302
Not this time.
Allison makes me watch Bravo.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.679
I know the names
of all the Real Housewives.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.223
But do you know the name
of every single guest

at Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding?
'Cause I do.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.228

07:59.312 --> 08:00.438
You're still gonna lose.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.689
You're still gonna be Bud.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.901
I saw a dolphin on the beach today.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.196
-Did you?
-Really? Today?

08:08.279 --> 08:11.574
Yes. I definitely saw a dolphin.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.160
When did you see a dolphin?
We've been together all day.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.579
You don't know what my eyes see.

08:16.662 --> 08:20.124
Wait, I feel like you were talking
about dolphins last time we played.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.501
Interesting.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.638
What? There's no code.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.307
-Jesus, Coyote.
-So there is a code.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.018
Well, either Coyote and Bud
are the worst Manchurian Candidates

08:39.101 --> 08:41.395
the world has ever seen,
or you three are cheating.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.064
We are not cheating.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.774
We're kind of cheating.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.277
How could you, Sol? In my final hours.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.988
What we're doing is not a bad thing.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.907
What kind of "thing" is it?

08:52.990 --> 08:58.204
We say "dolphins on the beach"
when we decide to let you guys win.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.705
Wow.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.750
For the record, I never want you to win.
I just... I get outvoted.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.502
[Mallory] This cannot be true.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.463
-Seriously?
-When did you ever let us win?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.508
Uh, let's see... When Brianna
got fired from Dippin' Dots.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.678
I wasn't fired. I was asked
not to return from vacation.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.680
That one time that Mallory froze up

09:15.763 --> 09:18.224
like a deer in the headlights
for the whole round.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.394
Thanks, Coyote. Now my back is sweating.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.980
So why are you letting us win tonight?

09:25.648 --> 09:26.941
Um, it's nothing.

09:27.024 --> 09:30.444
I'm just waiting for some test results.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.446
Oh, God, is everything okay?

09:32.530 --> 09:33.906
-[groans softly]
-What kind of tests?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.908
Everything's fine. It was just a checkup.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.078
But you know how your dad worries.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.832
I thought a game night
might take his mind off it.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.127
A distraction is one thing,
a pity victory is another.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.338
Is it that big of a deal?
We were just being nice.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.007
The Bergsteins believe in charity.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.758
Is that why you got the law firm?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.511
-How'd you get Say Grace, again?
-Enough. No more fighting.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.347
And no more
of this cheating-to-lose nonsense.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.765
The Hansons are gonna win

09:59.849 --> 10:01.392
-fair and square.
-[laughs]

10:01.976 --> 10:04.395
[clears throat]
I-I wouldn't mind a charity win.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.440
Good Lord, Mallory,
get your head in the game!

10:10.443 --> 10:11.777
Evening, ladies.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.614
This is my wife, Chelsea.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.699
-Chelsea, you remember Nick Skolka.
-Hi.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.785
And this is Grace.
She and Nick just got married.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.334
Oh. Nick, you got to meet my new CFO.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.045
He's a genius of tax evasion.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.672
-Ooh. Maybe I'll steal him from you.
-[chuckles]

10:33.132 --> 10:36.552
-You'll be okay, right?
-[scoffs] I can take care of myself.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.561
Hi, I'm Chelsea.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.021
I thought you were Chelsea.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.241
So you're Nick's new wife?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.618
[exhales] That's me.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.703
-I'm the new wife, too.
-Me too.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.746
Oh.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.084
What-- What do you all do?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.627
What do you mean?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.712
-[Grace] Well, for work.
-Oh.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.631
You mean like our charity work?

11:13.714 --> 11:16.759
Well, sure. Or, you know, "work" work.

11:17.218 --> 11:21.013
Well, I am thinking
about maybe starting my own business.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.723
Well, that's exciting.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.309
-Yeah.
-I actually started two businesses.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.353
-Oh.
-What are you thinking of doing?

11:27.436 --> 11:29.980
I want to make candy. For dogs.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.735
-Oh. Is there a market for that?
-[Chelsea] I think so.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.572
People like candy,
and dogs like what people like, so...

11:38.989 --> 11:41.283
-It's so important to have your own thing.
-[Chelsea] Mm-hmm.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.035
-Right?
-Yeah.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.123
Wow, two whole businesses.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.500
I want to be you when I grow up.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.335
[exhales]

11:51.419 --> 11:52.503
-Thank you.
-[Kayla] Yeah.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.047
All my grandma does is play bridge.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.466
-Oh.
-[Kayla and Skye chuckle]

11:57.550 --> 11:59.844
Could I get you ladies together
for a group shot?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.262
Ooh. Fun.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.974
Oh, no, no, Grace, don't get up.
We'll come to you.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.773
Smile, girls.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.110
[camera shutter clicking]

12:16.777 --> 12:18.696
He was the captain of the Slytherin team.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.365
[stammers]
He's zipping around with the scarf.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.201
Come on! Terrible teeth.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.745
-I--
-Time's up!

12:27.163 --> 12:30.249
-I begged you to read <i>Harry Potter.</i>
-Well, it was scary.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.171
That round was pitiful.
Suspiciously pitiful.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.923
I agree. How do we know
you're not still letting us win?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.426
We're not. These two are dead weight.

12:40.509 --> 12:45.473
Excuse me for temporarily blanking
on Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.558
All right. Fine, that was a hard one.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.936
But how do you explain what happened
with "first man on the moon"?

12:51.020 --> 12:54.982
Buzz Lightyear and Stretch Armstrong
are totally legitimate guesses.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.735
I think we need an embarrassing punishment
for the losers,

12:57.818 --> 13:00.070
-just to keep everyone honest.
-Great idea.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.322
How embarrassing?

13:01.405 --> 13:05.743
Something like... the losers have
to do stand-up at an open-mic night.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.371
Bring it. I have a tight five on Faith's
teething that Allison says would kill.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.751
How about the losers
have to stay away from the family?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.212
No brunches, no game nights...

13:16.295 --> 13:18.506
Sol, you're being awfully quiet.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.843
Because this idea is punitive
and shows a deep lack of trust.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.638
Says the Goody Two-shoes cheater.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.808
All right, Robert,
if it will make you happy,

13:28.891 --> 13:32.895
how about the losers
have to dress up like mimes

13:32.978 --> 13:34.855
and perform in front of Starbucks.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.607
Is that awful enough for you?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.360
It's humiliating.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.820
I dig it.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.447
I'm not afraid.
Allison says I'm an amazing mime.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.157
I could use the tip money.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.578
Wait, I'm not in. You all know
I have performance anxiety.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.249
-Then you'll have extra motivation to win.
-[Bud] What's wrong, Mal? Are the...

13:53.332 --> 13:55.543
Oh, ah, ah, ah.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.961
...walls closing in?

13:57.044 --> 14:00.339
That's impressive. Now all you need
is a ventriloquist dummy,

14:00.422 --> 14:02.633
and your virginity will grow back.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.845
[sound of arrow]

14:08.722 --> 14:09.890
-Aha!
-Oh.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.560
If it isn't bidder number 210.

14:12.643 --> 14:16.522
She's been down there for a while,
napping against my leg.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.400
Hi. You must be bidder number 47.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.068
Loved your doodle.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.779
You weren't supposed to love it.
That was a warning shot.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.990
Next doodle, I'm going nuclear.

14:26.073 --> 14:30.077
Uh, I'm just here for the sneakers.
And to support a good cause.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.954
He gets it.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.333
Why do you even want them?
You're clearly not a real Deadhead.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.961
Why not?
Because I can carry off a great suit?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.379
You really can.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.547
[chuckles]

14:41.630 --> 14:43.424
If you're a Deadhead, prove it.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.135
My first show was in 1971.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.469
Fillmore East?

14:47.803 --> 14:49.847
No. The Capitol Theatre.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.850
That was my first tour, too.
Changed my life.

14:52.933 --> 14:57.646
Okay, but how many shows did you see
at the Garden in '91

14:57.730 --> 14:59.982
when Jerry wore the sneakers?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.484
All nine. How many did you see?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.278
-Seven.
-Oh.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.656
But only because I got too high
and fell asleep on a bus.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.991
[chuckles]

15:09.450 --> 15:10.451
Twice.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.287
Well, it's been a pleasure, 47.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.415
And when you lose the auction,
just remember what Jerry said:

15:16.749 --> 15:19.543
"If you plant ice,
you're gonna harvest wind."

15:19.627 --> 15:22.755
You're the one
who's gonna harvest wind, my friend.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.799
'Cause I can keep bidding all night!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.176
So can I.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.305
Wow, what a generous bid.

15:31.388 --> 15:34.391
Oh, don't fall for the bad boys, Don.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.143
And hand me that sheet.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.232
Okay, he showed Janet Jackson's boob
at the Super Bowl.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.526
-Wha--
-He wrote "Cry Me a River" about Britney.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.738
I don't know! I can't think!

15:48.155 --> 15:49.198
Is he a K-pop?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.408
No. Dad, stop saying K-pop.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.244
Mallory, in fifth grade,
you said you wanted to marry him.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.833
-Kenny?
-Oh, my God!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.502
-Kenny?
-[laughing]

16:03.545 --> 16:07.549
[exhales] I need another vodka... martini.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.467
Frankie.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.718
Shh.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.639
My Spidey-senses are tingling.
He's about to bid again.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.182
Who's "he"?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.477
Great suit. Bidding war. Keep up.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.064
Meanwhile, Nick and Sam
are off making some deal,

16:22.147 --> 16:24.358
and I get stuck with the Mean Girls.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.194
Oh, Grace, I'm sorry,
I should have been there.

16:27.277 --> 16:31.407
You're not great with young people.
And teenagers can be so cruel.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.201
They're not literally mean girls.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.370
They're young, vapid trophy wives.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.082
One of them wants to make candy for dogs.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.376
Have you ever heard of anything so stupid?

16:45.963 --> 16:48.382
Uh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean it.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.466
Yes, you did.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.011
You just didn't mean for me to hear it.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.887
[exhales]

16:56.765 --> 17:00.060
Told you. As a younger person myself,

17:00.144 --> 17:03.147
even I have felt uncomfortable
being around you.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.693
[Frankie] Chelsea still looks
really upset,

17:07.776 --> 17:10.154
-but the brunette is giving her cake.
-[exhales]

17:10.738 --> 17:12.906
Sam just told me you insulted his wife.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
-What the hell did you say?
-[Frankie] Mmm.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.661
I think it's time for another bid.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.538
-Good luck.
-You, too.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.040
Well?

17:21.790 --> 17:26.045
She heard me say she was a trophy wife
and that her idea is stupid.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.756
Which, in my defense, it is.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.885
Well, it's traditional to wait
till the car ride home to trash people.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.928
I'm not excusing what I did,

17:35.012 --> 17:36.680
but she insulted me, too.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.015
-What did she say?
-[exhales]

17:38.098 --> 17:40.100
She wants to be me when she grows up.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.894
-And?
-[scoffs]

17:41.977 --> 17:45.189
And they don't think I'm spry enough
to squat for a picture.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.107
Who squats for a picture?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.901
-Young women!
-Oh...

17:48.984 --> 17:52.029
Is this age thing
always gonna be an issue for you?

17:52.112 --> 17:54.239
Clearly, it's an issue for you, too.

17:54.823 --> 17:58.786
I saw you when Sam's mouth
was hanging open like an oven door

17:58.869 --> 18:00.537
after he heard you married me.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.289
What was I supposed to say?

18:02.372 --> 18:04.833
You're supposed to say,
"Shut your oven door mouth.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.668
I'm lucky to have this woman!"

18:09.838 --> 18:10.881
You're right.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.509
It was awkward. I felt for the guy.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.677
I didn't know how to handle it. I...

18:16.595 --> 18:17.638
I'm sorry.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.306
Thank you.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.392
But you were still mean to his wife.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.438
Technically, I was mean near his wife.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.608
Look, I'm sorry they made you feel bad.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.570
But... you're the grown-up here.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.905
Regrettably.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.741
So don't you think
you should be the one to...

18:38.492 --> 18:39.576
to fix this?

18:46.416 --> 18:47.459
Oh...

18:48.544 --> 18:50.587
-Dame Judi Dench!
-[excited cry]

18:50.671 --> 18:52.131
Yes! Yes!

18:52.214 --> 18:53.298
[both grunting]

18:53.590 --> 18:55.551
-[laughs] Okay!
-Good job.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.969
-How many?
-[Bud] Ah...

18:57.052 --> 18:59.638
Thirteen. Way to catch up, Bergsteins.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.890
We can still win this thing.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.394
I don't know. They only need three
to win, and it's Brianna's turn.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.895
Actually, it's mine.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.897
And it's the hard round
with the two-word clues.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.275
Oh, sweet, merciful saints.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.443
[softly] Okay. Just relax.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.405
Why are you brushing me like that?

19:16.488 --> 19:19.366
It's what I do with Spit
when there are fireworks.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.952
-I like it.
-I know you do, girl.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.871
-It's nice. I like it.
-Um, are you ready?

19:23.954 --> 19:25.372
[child-like voice] That's a good girl.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.707
-That's a good girl.
-Okay.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.376
And go!

19:30.043 --> 19:31.086
[Bud chuckles]

19:31.211 --> 19:32.921
Uh... runs Russia.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.007
-Vladimir Putin.
-Good.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.093
-Greatest woman.
-[yells] Oprah!

19:38.177 --> 19:40.262
[squeals] Oh, my God, I'm killing it!

19:40.345 --> 19:41.680
Let's not get cocky.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.017
[exhales]

19:46.560 --> 19:47.394
Uh...

19:47.477 --> 19:48.854
[stifled laughter]

19:49.271 --> 19:50.272
-Shh!
-God.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.483
Okay, okay, okay.
Mallory. Come back to us.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.736
Follow the sound of my voice.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.155
Say something, sweetheart. Anything.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.239
[Coyote laughs]

19:59.323 --> 20:00.490
Got to start talking, Mallory.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.535
Not no.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.038
Not no? Yes?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.289
Yasser Arafat?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.332
[breathing rapidly]

20:08.415 --> 20:09.708
-[laughter]
-[Robert] Shh!

20:09.791 --> 20:11.168
Not no!

20:11.251 --> 20:13.045
Maybe? Baby? Baby Jane?

20:13.128 --> 20:15.214
Uh, B-Bette Davis?

20:15.797 --> 20:18.383
-Not no!
-I bet you guys wish those dolphins

20:18.467 --> 20:20.302
-were on the beach right now.
-Shh.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.137
[inaudible murmurs]

20:22.221 --> 20:24.723
-Not no.
<i>-No Country For Old Men.</i> No...

20:24.806 --> 20:26.975
[overlapping murmurs]

20:27.100 --> 20:28.560
"Yesterday"?

20:28.644 --> 20:29.686
Paul McCartney?

20:30.395 --> 20:31.438
[gasping]

20:35.025 --> 20:37.903
I believe the answer is
Sir Paul McCartney.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.197
-That's right!
-Holy fuck, we won!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.615
Yes!

20:41.698 --> 20:42.699
[Robert laughs]

20:42.783 --> 20:43.700
-[Robert] Yes!
-Dad!

20:43.784 --> 20:46.912
Sol, tell me, please,
that you did not throw this game.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.457
I swear, I was just trying
to figure it out. Ugh.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.292
Why couldn't I keep my mouth shut?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.585
You will soon.

20:53.669 --> 20:57.130
No, but you know what? The game
did take my mind off the doctor.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.799
So thank you for that.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.342
[Brianna chanting] We are the best!

21:00.425 --> 21:01.385
You're welcome.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.762
Of course, now that it's over,
and I have time to think...

21:03.845 --> 21:06.265
-[Brianna]<i> ♪ You're all dumber than us ♪</i>
-[Mallory] We beat you.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.060
I'm gonna go gnaw on a stick of butter.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.271
[Brianna and Mallory cheer]

21:13.480 --> 21:14.481
Don?

21:15.816 --> 21:16.942
Hello?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.860
I have to make a bid.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.154
Too late. Auction's over.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.782
I guess you won.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.451
If-- If it's any consolation,

21:26.535 --> 21:30.122
I wound up donating
a crazy amount of money to thwart you.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.291
That does make me feel better.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.753
I think Jerry would be happy
the money went to a good cause

21:36.837 --> 21:39.506
and the sneakers went to a real Deadhead.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.841
Oh. [chuckles]

21:41.341 --> 21:45.971
Actually, I've been thinking, how about
in the spirit of Jerry, we split them?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.848
-Really?
-[chuckles]

21:48.223 --> 21:49.683
[exhales, sniffs]

21:49.766 --> 21:52.561
Oh, it still smells like weed.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.062
I will treasure it.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.273
Well, see you around, 47.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.191
See you around, 210.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.904
Maybe one of these days, our sneakers
can get together for a date?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.158
Call me. [chuckles]

22:10.078 --> 22:10.996
Hey.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.789
Hey.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.209
Uh, Chelsea, I...

22:17.419 --> 22:19.004
I owe you an apology.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.882
I owe you all one. I...

22:22.299 --> 22:25.761
I shouldn't have dismissed you like that.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.138
I know what it feels like.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.806
Someone called you young and vapid?

22:29.890 --> 22:32.934
Well, not in quite some time, but...

22:36.021 --> 22:40.025
Oh, come on, you all have to admit
that you were a little judgy

22:40.108 --> 22:42.652
when you found out I was Nick's new wife.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.739
Well, I guess I was a little surprised
to see you were in your sixties.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.575
Thank you for being honest.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.285
Why is everyone so hung up on age?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.537
Either you're too young
or you're too old.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.581
Especially if you're a woman.

22:55.624 --> 23:00.504
But like Jerry said,
"We live no particular way but our own."

23:00.587 --> 23:02.506
What's the lady with the sneaker?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.299
This is my friend, Frankie.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.176
Soulmate-slash-guru.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.553
-And business partner.
-Yes.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.265
We actually started a business
to help older women feel empowered.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.351
-I want to feel empowered.
-Me, too.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.311
That's why I want to start a business.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.147
So I can be more
than just Sam Miller's wife.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.946
You know, I kind of started Say Grace
for the same reason.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.908
So I wasn't just Robert Hanson's wife.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.163
If you really want to make dog candy,
I'd like to help you.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.373
We both will.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.958
That would be awesome!

23:38.500 --> 23:41.420
Okay, well, if you... if you have a dog,
I could send you samples.

23:41.503 --> 23:46.133
Oh, great. Just so you know,
Champ has a real healthy appetite,

23:46.216 --> 23:50.929
so feel free to send more candy
than you think a dog could possibly eat.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.141
-How you doing?
-Good.

23:54.975 --> 23:55.809
We're good.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.020
Hey, what's everyone doing after this?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.106
I'm down for whatever.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.065
As if.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.571
Let's go dancing.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.781
Oh, always with the dancing.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.701
Why don't we go home
and watch a war movie?

24:13.201 --> 24:15.537
How are you two with trespassing?

24:16.079 --> 24:19.458
I know this was a lot for you.
I'm happy to go home if you're tired.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.084
No, I want to go out.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.379
I've got a handsome, young trophy husband
to show off.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.798
I've never been arm candy before.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.176
-[chuckles]
-Boy, I bet I'll be great at it.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.387
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.972
Shotgun!

24:34.556 --> 24:35.891
[Nick chuckles]

24:44.107 --> 24:46.651
-Want me to help?
-[grunts] Uh, no, no.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.071
I'm just trying to figure out
the best angle of attack.

24:50.155 --> 24:54.159
God, maybe if I penguin slide in
on my... on my stomach.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.579
I got you.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.457
-[grunts in effort] One, two, three.
-Oh!

25:01.208 --> 25:02.751
[giggles] Yes!

25:03.960 --> 25:06.630

25:09.508 --> 25:10.842
Cool ride, Sam.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.976
Sol, hurry up.
They're waiting at Starbucks.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.275
Aw, don't pout. You look adorable.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.569
But there is one thing missing.

25:31.071 --> 25:35.033
Really? You don't think the makeup
and the jazz pants sell it?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.786
Ah, use your hands, not your words.

25:56.054 --> 25:56.930
Hello?

Speaking.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.185
Oh, hello, Dr. Rogers.
Thank you for calling.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.647
You did? And?

26:07.649 --> 26:09.651
[exhales] It's good news.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.070
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.823
Sure, he's right here.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.202
Yes, hi, I'm here.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.207
All right.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.792
Thank you.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.925
They found something in my blood work.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.596
I have to go back in.
