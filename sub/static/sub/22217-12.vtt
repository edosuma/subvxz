[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.888 --> 00:16.099
Now I realize, it's more than that.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.769
I wanna invest money in our company.
I wanna use it to buy you out.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.188
If you're not okay with that,
buy me out.

00:22.772 --> 00:26.651
-I need to see this through, on my own.
-It feels good walking away from this.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.280
-I wanna make my own way.
-The real world can be unforgiving.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.783
-You don't realize how hard it'll be.
-Maybe it's time for me to move out.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.244
There's no need to make it on
your own. That's what family's for.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.455
[Sammy Jo] That's why
I'm moving in with Steven.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.292
Rise and shine, handsome.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.753
Mm, let's sleep in.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.757
A perk of owning the company,
we can do that.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.178
I would love to,
but we have breakfast in bed.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.306
And you know
how punctual Anders is.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.308
-Good morning, sir.
-Worse than an alarm clock.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.685
-Some might say better.
-No snooze button.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.486
You're cute
with your real newspaper.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.406
God forbid someone choose real
journalism over a Twitter feed.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.534
Bob Channing is a friend and still
publishes a hell of a paper,

01:16.618 --> 01:20.747
which is why I invited him to cover
the fundraiser for Senator Daniels.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.209
The guest list is packed with
brown-nosers and sycophants.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.378
At $10,000 a plate,
the senator should be delighted.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.756
Considering
we're expecting 200 people.

01:30.381 --> 01:34.677
It's a healthy contribution, but the
senator's always been good to CA.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.763
Supporting his campaign
is the least I can do.

01:36.846 --> 01:41.267
The best part about casino night is you
playing the Pussy Galore to my 007.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.229
[Cristal giggles]

01:45.605 --> 01:46.940
-Oh.
-What's wrong?

01:47.023 --> 01:49.818
I'm just not a sweets
for breakfast kind of guy.

01:49.901 --> 01:50.902
Who are you then?

01:54.239 --> 01:57.867
Someone you need
to get to know better, I guess.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.456
Culhane,
the Aston's blocking my--

02:04.124 --> 02:04.958
Oh.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.377
Good morning.

02:09.378 --> 02:13.007
Right. The silent treatment.
Well, at least you're consistent.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.051
You didn't check on me
after I was kidnapped

02:15.135 --> 02:18.179
by Bonnie and Clydito,
or comment on my bangs.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.723
Were those your idea
or your fivehead's?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.393
My version of PTSD
is me realizing

02:23.476 --> 02:27.647
I need to work on my relationships.
So, let me be the grown-up here.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.023
I'm sorry, okay?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.109
-Everything good here?
-Not really.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.737
Come on. We're OG.
We've been friends for over a decade.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.157
-And I have the scars to prove it.
-Look, I broke up with Jeff.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.701
Isn't that what you wanted?
We can go back to the way we were.

02:39.784 --> 02:40.785
Being frenemies?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.246
No. Being the power couple
of besties.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.001
My dad is having a casino party
tomorrow. It'll be fun, like old times.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.255
-Come on. Please. I miss you.
-You miss one-sided friendships

02:52.338 --> 02:56.134
where you download all of your crap
and not have to show empathy.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.343
Aren't you sweet?

02:59.554 --> 03:02.599
-Fallon--
-Don't worry. I'll move the car myself.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.314
Excuse me, Security's asked me
to remove you

03:09.397 --> 03:10.940
for impersonating the COO.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.151
Rick Morales? Oh!

03:13.234 --> 03:16.237
Just in time to save me
from my budget reports.

03:18.072 --> 03:18.990
Wow.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.868
This is an upgrade
from your PR associate days.

03:21.951 --> 03:22.785
Yeah?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.914
We wouldn't have had to sneak
into the break room for privacy.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.374
I actually have windows now.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.419
Oh, thank God.
Your dungeon cubicle

03:31.502 --> 03:35.340
used to reek of Ming's Chinese
takeout from all those late nights.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.134
-Looks like the hard work's paid off.
-Yeah.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
Now I have people bring me sushi.

03:40.803 --> 03:41.638
Take a seat.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.432
So, how's my favorite
cub reporter?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.560
Oh, I think you mean
your favorite senior reporter.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.980
I always knew you'd be
on the fast track to editor-in-chief.

03:51.481 --> 03:55.568
Look, um, Cristal,
I didn't come here just to say hi.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.404
I'm writing a major exposÃ©
on Senator Daniels.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.616
Really? We're hosting a fundraiser
for him tomorrow.

04:01.699 --> 04:05.036
I know. I was assigned to cover
the senatorial race

04:05.119 --> 04:08.414
and heard rumors that when
Daniels was a judge years ago,

04:08.581 --> 04:09.499
he took bribes.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.544
Now, I have dozens of sources,
all on the record.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.257
Thank you for telling me.
I'll talk to Blake about canceling.

04:17.339 --> 04:21.135
The thing is that one of the people
that Daniels took bribes from...

04:21.886 --> 04:23.137
was Blake.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.723
He could go to prison for that.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.310
No. Blake would
never bribe a judge.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.437
My sources are really solid.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.440
You might not know your
husband as well as you think.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.744
-What was that?
-What?

04:47.245 --> 04:50.415
-Were you just checking out my ass?
-Excuse me?

04:50.498 --> 04:53.710
Wow. Unbelievable. You're collecting
material for your spank bank

04:53.793 --> 04:55.545
before finishing your morning coffee.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.881
I was gonna ask how you
enjoyed your bacon this morning.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.634
The fantasy where you're smart, funny,
and appealing to women

05:01.718 --> 05:04.345
-only exists on your laptop.
-I only wanted--

05:04.429 --> 05:08.808
Don't touch me. I'd never have sex
with you, you pasty-faced perv.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.852
I'm not sure how to translate
that into douchebag,

05:10.935 --> 05:14.772
but I know self-defense and I will shove
my Louboutin's so far--

05:14.856 --> 05:18.443
There's a piece of bacon
stuck to the back of your pants.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.535
I will take the stairs.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.919
Everything okay? I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.588
I couldn't even reach your assistant.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.592
I fired Tammy. The woman wore
prairie skirts. I need a replacement.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.469
Especially if you're
gonna keep avoiding me.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.471
That takes
some special scheduling.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.683
I'm giving you your space,
but I'm also not going anywhere.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.978
That's sweet. Thank you for not melting
into a pool of your own emotions

05:54.062 --> 05:56.939
making this awkward,
but we're still broken up.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.609
We need to discuss the buyout,
who's walking away with what.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.694
You haven't responded to my offer.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.073
I got eight companies and two lawyers.
They'll get to it.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.326
Now, we need to work out our lease
with Tim Myers. He'll be here soon.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.746
He owns the property
where 33 percent

06:11.829 --> 06:15.708
of our turbines are situated. If Tim
doesn't agree to renew the lease,

06:15.792 --> 06:18.711
he could shut us down. We'd have
to pay to relocate those turbines.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.172
-I'm talking millions--
-Stop worrying.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.966
You know I can charm
the pants off of anyone.

06:24.884 --> 06:25.718
[scoffs]

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
Tim, welcome. Great to see you.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.308
I'd like you to meet my partner,
Fallon.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.898
[theme music playing]

06:53.371 --> 06:56.249
[Jeff] Most of our properties,
we own the land, but for our leases,

06:56.332 --> 06:58.084
we have a set percentage
we pay per turbine.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.878
Since we're looking to expand
our operation on your land,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.505
we can offer $10 mil a month.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.299
And because we're confident
in our business model,

07:05.383 --> 07:07.176
we're open to signing
a five-year lease.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.470
-You think we got a deal?
-Not quite.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.558
Well, our lawyers
can finesse the fine print.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.727
Don't bother,
unless you can double your offer.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.815
Uh, where is this coming from?
Our offer is more than generous.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.860
-You're not gonna find a better rate.
-And we can't set that precedent,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.320
-nor can we afford to.
-Of course not.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.740
You spent that money
on your Louboutins.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.368
Tim?

07:33.578 --> 07:37.123
Can we talk? We might've
gotten off on the wrong foot.

07:37.206 --> 07:41.335
I'm late for my next appointment.
Call me if you're still interested.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.177
-We need to talk.
-Can it wait? I am late for a--

07:49.260 --> 07:52.847
I heard from a reporter that
Daniels took bribes from people.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.142
And you were
one of those people.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.810
Who's the reporter?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.979
That's your first question?

08:00.188 --> 08:02.398
It's a personal friend,
and I'm not betraying that trust.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.401
Stop deflecting.
Bribing a judge is a felony.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.952
-It was a long time ago.
-Doesn't make it less of a felony.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.789
What do you want me to say?
It happened. I had no choice.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.211
Let me guess, it got Carrington Atlantic
out of a couple of jams or--

08:23.294 --> 08:25.296
It was for Fallon and Steven.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.257
When Alexis left, she wanted
full custody.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.761
I had enough dirt on her to keep that
from happening, but I also knew that

08:31.844 --> 08:33.513
if I revealed that in court,

08:34.054 --> 08:36.224
it would devastate
Fallon and Steven.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.852
If I didn't play my hand
and I was forced to share custody,

08:39.936 --> 08:43.648
I knew that she would take my children
and leave the country.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.025
I couldn't let that happen.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.152
So, I turned to Daniels.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.241
He made sure that Alexis
was deemed a flight risk...

08:54.283 --> 08:55.910
ruled the case in my favor.

08:56.244 --> 09:00.081
I just let Steven and Fallon think
that she had abandoned them.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.292
-Blake, I didn't realize--
-It was only once,

09:03.918 --> 09:05.503
and I did what was best
for my children.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.506
Yes, but why still support a man
who uses other people's money

09:08.589 --> 09:11.133
-to control the justice system?
-That's not who he is anymore.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.553
He's a good man.
And I owe him a lot.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.015
I don't have to tell you, if this
story sees the light of day,

09:18.099 --> 09:20.017
Steven and Fallon
will never forgive me.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.310
I understand.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.233
I'll make sure the story
doesn't run.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.318
Perfect. I'll see you tomorrow.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.489
Third job interview on the books.

09:34.282 --> 09:38.578
I've sent my rÃ©sumÃ© everywhere
and have yet to get one response.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.123
Lunch is here, boys.
Thought I'd stop by for a visit,

09:42.206 --> 09:46.252
but didn't wanna risk being fed
ramen or hot dogs, so I BYOL'ed it.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.254
Bless you.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.553
I miss you so much.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.470
How could you?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.973
This is your tenth visit
in ten days.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.725
Well, whose fault is that?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.312
You've had fun with your
Craigslist-decorated co-op.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.231
-Can you come home?
-Sorry. Bigger picture at stake.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.401
Ugh! You and your ethics.
Can you promise me

10:10.484 --> 10:12.111
you'll come to the casino
fundraiser tomorrow?

10:12.194 --> 10:13.279
You know I'm not a gambler.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.157
-Kevin Rathbun's doing the food.
-We're going.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.992
Why can't my life be as simple
as his?

10:18.075 --> 10:20.494
All his problems are solved with lunch.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.164
Jeff doesn't wanna let me go,
Monica doesn't wanna be my friend,

10:23.247 --> 10:24.749
and I have a huge
business deal hanging--

10:24.832 --> 10:28.586
Fallon, I love you, but I can't
serve as your therapist again.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.920
But I just brought you lunch,

10:30.004 --> 10:32.089
and that glass of Dom
cost more than my shrink.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.008
Maybe that's the job
I should be applying for.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.095
Not your shrink.
You couldn't pay me enough.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.307
I have job interviews
to prepare for.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.729
Thanks for coming.
Let me fix you a drink.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.317
Feels like I should sit down for this.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.818
[sighs]

10:56.947 --> 10:58.824
Off the record, you were right.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.953
Blake admitted to the bribe,
but it was for a good reason.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.622
I'm sure most of them
thought they were

11:04.705 --> 11:08.167
-committing crimes for a good reason.
-Blake's not one of them.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.754
-He needed to get custody.
-There's a better way to do that. -It's called the justice system.
-I wouldn't be asking if I didn't have to,

11:15.716 --> 11:19.428
-but I need you to scrap the story.
-Daniels is crooked. -This kind of piece could end him.
-There will be other stories.

11:23.641 --> 11:27.311
This is why I got into journalism.
To expose jerks like this,

11:27.395 --> 11:30.231
to expose the truth.
You used to care about that.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.736
I--

11:36.362 --> 11:37.196
I'm sorry,

11:38.697 --> 11:42.201
I'm not gonna compromise
my integrity or my career for--

11:42.910 --> 11:43.744
For this.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.457
You're right.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.544
I shouldn't be asking you
to kill the story.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.716
I should be asking your boss,
Bob Channing.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.010
He's a friend of the family.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.890
And I could have him end your
career just as fast as I started it.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.644
It's not just your husband
who's one of them.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.813
It's you, too.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.902
I need a favor, Moni, big one.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.738
-I'm listening.
-Make up with Fallon,

12:20.072 --> 12:21.615
convince her
to give me another chance.

12:21.699 --> 12:25.911
Seriously? Does this girl have some
kind of hypnotic yoni or something?

12:25.995 --> 12:28.247
-Monica, it's--
-No. I'm done with her.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.084
And you should be, too.
Sorry, but I'm not helping you fix

12:32.168 --> 12:34.962
a relationship that never should've
existed in the first place.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.548
Glad we had this talk.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.802
I don't want a relationship
with Fallon.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.637
I need one.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.974
If you reconcile, you can push
her back toward me.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.809
I need that help
if I'm gonna marry her.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.686
Now you wanna marry the bitch?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.438
Have you lost your mind?

12:52.521 --> 12:55.232
It's the only way I'll have
influence over her CA shares.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.569
My first step in taking
the company away from Blake.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.281
The Carringtons are the reason
Dad's in prison, Monica.

13:02.364 --> 13:06.494
Blake framed him with drug charges,
had him locked up this whole time.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.872
-Why would Blake wanna frame Dad?
-Blake was having an affair with Mom

13:09.955 --> 13:12.082
and wanted Dad out of the picture.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.045
That family's the reason
we grew up without a father,

13:16.462 --> 13:18.380
why Mom
nearly took her own life,

13:19.131 --> 13:22.259
and why I'm finally gonna
make them pay for all of it.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.844
This is insane.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.891
How long have you
known about this?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.977
-Why wouldn't you tell me?
-I couldn't.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.021
I'll admit,
she's as flawed as they come,

13:34.104 --> 13:36.815
but making her pay
for her father's mistakes...

13:37.441 --> 13:39.818
that just means that you and
Blake are cut from the same cloth.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.404
-I am nothing like Blake.
-No.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.823
If you go through with this...

13:45.574 --> 13:46.784
you might be worse.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.377
I like to think of my assistant
as a friend that I can scream at

13:56.460 --> 13:59.129
without ever having to apologize.
I like to think of my assistant

13:59.213 --> 14:01.131
as an automatic like
to all my Insta-posts.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.676
I like to think of my assistant
as a smartphone

14:03.759 --> 14:05.427
with a built-in
medical marijuana card.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.763
What's the hottest club in Buckhead?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.808
It says here you're fluent in
German, Korean, and Swahili.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.601
[speaks in foreign languages]

14:12.685 --> 14:14.853
Well, I hope you're fluent
in the most important language,

14:14.937 --> 14:17.022
Fallon Carrington.
What's your biggest weakness?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.315
Not taking enough breaks.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.692
How do you feel
about prairie skirts?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.777
-Oh, I love prairie skirts--
-Next.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.822
What diet would be better,
paleo or macrobiotic?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.992
-With the right chef, I--
-Wrong. Your only concern

14:28.075 --> 14:31.287
should be getting my order right,
body-shamer. Get out.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.706
[Fallon sighs]

14:34.707 --> 14:36.208
[theme music playing]

14:37.167 --> 14:39.169
I'm guessing she's not the winner?

14:39.253 --> 14:42.131
You can't spell
"Assistant" without an "ass."

14:42.214 --> 14:43.173
What's up?

14:43.507 --> 14:45.926
You figure out how
to make things right with Myers?

14:46.010 --> 14:48.220
We still can't afford
the extra 10 million a month

14:48.304 --> 14:50.472
-he wants for that lease.
-I just can't call the man

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
and apologize over the phone.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.642
These things
must be handled in person.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.521
-Good. So when you meeting him?
-Tonight at Daddy's casino party.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.691
After some cyber-stalking,
I got his G7's flight log.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.319
He's in Vegas every
other weekend, so I invited him.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.740
It's perfect. I'll get him tipsy
and he'll be receptive to my charm.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
Okay if I just drop in like this?

15:12.661 --> 15:15.497
I know Fallon does it,
but she's your landlord,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.000
so I didn't know
if the same rules apply.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.501
Always happy to see you.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.759
Mm. I think this might be my favorite
piece of clothing that you own.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.219
Mm. I do have matching pants.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.387
Wanna see?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.897
What's wrong?

15:42.608 --> 15:43.734
I'm sorry, Michael.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.278
I thought
I came here for this but--

15:46.487 --> 15:48.364
Maybe you just need a friend?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.116
I get it.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.329
Must be hard for you and Fallon
to not be talking.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.582
I mean, she's been your girl
for a long time.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.377
I don't know what to do
or who to trust.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.718
I don't want you to be late for work.
Let's hang out tonight.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.970
Netflix and chill?

16:11.470 --> 16:12.429
I can't tonight.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.225
-Oh! I didn't mean to assume.
-Oh, no, no. I want to.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.895
Trust me. I just gotta go to that
Carrington casino thing.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.897
Blake knows I play poker.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.608
He likes me to be there
to loosen up the tighter players.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.151
Right. That's cool.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.571
-I get it.
-I do, however, have a plus one.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.450
The only reason I didn't
tell you is 'cause

16:33.534 --> 16:36.078
Fallon was gonna be there,
and I don't wanna get in between

16:36.161 --> 16:38.539
y'all's thing any more
than I already am.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.834
Thank you.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.627
I think I might.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.176
What do you think? Does this say
"Nouveau Poor" to you?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.762
Says there's nothing
straight in this room.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
That's a little low on the right.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.727
So, let's hear it.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.770
-How did the interview go?
-I got it.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.439
-What?
-Yeah. They offered me

17:03.522 --> 17:06.191
director of their philanthropic arm.
Could be a really steady gig.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.028
I'm qualified,
and I earned it myself.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.448
Okay. So, I only heard
"qualified" and "steady" in there.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.285
You were born into royalty
with a trust fund to match,

17:16.367 --> 17:20.289
and you blow the whole thing off
to reinvent yourself for "steady"?

17:20.580 --> 17:23.250
-This is your reinvention?
-What else am I supposed to do?

17:23.333 --> 17:25.669
If I dream too big,
you dream too small.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.837
All I'm saying is,

17:26.920 --> 17:29.214
if you're gonna go through
all of this trouble to be poor,

17:29.298 --> 17:32.051
the least you can do
is be passionate

17:32.301 --> 17:34.470
about what the hell it is you
wanna be when you grow up. -We can't all be dreamers.
-Why not?

17:36.805 --> 17:38.640
Because it's not realistic.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.644
What I need right now is stability.
And this job is very stable.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.562
Sure.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.482
Do me a favor, lie to yourself...

17:46.982 --> 17:48.150
not to me.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
<i>âª Whenever I'm with you âª</i>

17:50.736 --> 17:52.863
Cristal Carrington
for Mr. Channing.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.200
No, no message.
He's attending an event

17:56.283 --> 17:58.994
at my house.
I'll speak to him then. Thank you.

18:01.455 --> 18:05.209
Cristal, darling, I want
you to meet Senator Daniels...

18:06.001 --> 18:09.129
-and his lovely wife, Melissa.
-How do they say it in Mexico?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.214
[speaks in Spanish]

18:10.297 --> 18:12.966
Very good. They also
say that in Venezuela,

18:13.050 --> 18:16.053
-where I'm actually from.
-Well done, Carrington.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.431
Paul wants to go over his speech.
You two okay?

18:19.515 --> 18:21.767
Perfect. Always perfect.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.940
-Please, come in.
-[Melissa] Thank you.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.650
Can I make you one?

18:29.775 --> 18:30.859
Ha!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.694
My husband is also my boss

18:32.778 --> 18:35.656
and he might not approve
of his COO day drinking.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.617
Well, you two
are just so adorable.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.162
I remember when I used to care
what Paul thought of me.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.749
That's what's nice
about the honeymoon period

18:45.833 --> 18:47.126
you and Blake are in.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.253
Well, we've had our ups and downs,

18:49.336 --> 18:51.296
but I'm making sure
the honeymoon keeps on going.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.633
You seem smart.
I'm gonna give you some advice.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.636
Being married to someone
as powerful as Blake

18:57.719 --> 18:59.429
can wipe out your identity.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.349
It is up to you
to be true to yourself.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.355
With all due respect, you
and I are very different that way.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.358
-Blake married me for who I am.
-Well, of course.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.653
It's just I didn't
notice it at first either.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.989
I just started making
small compromises

19:17.072 --> 19:19.867
and looking the other way
to support my husband.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.619
The next thing you know,
I was in too deep.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.331
But what's integrity when
you can have this bracelet?

19:26.415 --> 19:27.624
[chuckles]

19:27.708 --> 19:30.085
It costs more than
the home I grew up in.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.131
I'm never gonna
be anything like that.

19:34.423 --> 19:38.594
You probably won't feel that way
after my husband's speech tonight.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.679
-Why is that?
-Nobody knows this,

19:40.762 --> 19:44.474
but Paul is taking
a new anti-immigration stance...

19:44.933 --> 19:47.352
build the wall,
SB 1070 kind of stuff.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.023
Surely for someone like you,
that's a hard pill to swallow,

19:51.565 --> 19:53.567
just to support your husband.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.986
Hm.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.834
<i>âª Who's your daddy?</i>
<i>What's his name? âª</i>

20:15.088 --> 20:16.632
<i>âª I like your lipstick âª</i>

20:16.715 --> 20:18.967
Gorgeous and on time as usual.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.096
Before I forget, you killed
your friend's story, right?

20:23.847 --> 20:25.557
Don't worry. I'm handling it.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.310
What I'm not handling is the fact
that we're supporting someone

20:28.393 --> 20:30.479
who would have had
me deported at the border.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.774
You heard about the speech.
It's meant to fire up the base,

20:33.857 --> 20:35.609
not be turned into policy.
Sometimes you have

20:35.692 --> 20:37.527
to compromise
your values for the greater good.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.030
-What's greater than your values?
-Well...

20:40.614 --> 20:42.991
try to put your personal views
aside.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.077
The senator
and his wife are here.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.370
[chattering]

20:47.412 --> 20:48.747
We need to greet them.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.041
I'll let you handle that honor.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.544
You're good enough at compromising
for the both of us.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.679
[Blake] Senator.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.640
You certainly know
how to make an entrance.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.601
-Blake, thanks for doing this.
-Of course. You look radiant.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.229
Why, thank you.
So, where is Cristal?

21:12.312 --> 21:14.523
Did you lock her in the
wine cellar with the other wife?

-Jeff, pleasure to meet you.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.376
You as well.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.794
-Congrats.
-[Bob] Thank you.

21:35.877 --> 21:39.047
Steven, I understand
congratulations are in order.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.883
Your new job?
The Global Housing Works?

21:41.967 --> 21:44.344
-When do you start?
-Wait. How did you--?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.055
I asked you not to get involved.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.350
And I didn't.
Greg Anderson and I go way back.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.769
He called me the second
you walked out of his office.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.104
-Of course he did.
-It's not my fault

21:54.187 --> 21:55.981
if Greg loves the idea
of a Carrington on the masthead,

21:56.064 --> 21:57.691
and it's not yours either.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.109
Take it as a win.

22:02.779 --> 22:06.450
Looks like your dad's more excited
about this job than you are.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.951
What does that tell you?

Thank you, sir.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.756
It's nice to have a high-roller
show up for amateur hour.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.258
I never turn down
a chance to roll the dice.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.554
That's good, 'cause I'm hoping
you'll roll them one more time with us.

22:27.971 --> 22:31.475
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst at the elevator.

22:31.808 --> 22:35.020
I treated you like a Grade A perv
and, needless to say,

22:35.103 --> 22:36.313
it was uncalled for.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.856
I'm truly sorry.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.942
Didn't give it a second thought,
neither should you.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.488
Should we send over
our original contract?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.783
Yeah, you can send it.
But I'm still not gonna sign it.

22:48.366 --> 22:51.161
Look. I didn't hike the price
because of Fallon.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.664
I hiked it because I got
another offer for twice that much.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.125
That's money I can't turn down.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.755

you were thinking again, Crissy.

23:16.645 --> 23:20.357
-I've got a few decisions to make.
-Try not to hurt yourself.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.526
I thought we were past that,
Fallon. Some children never truly mature.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.614
Just because you technically
saved my life doesn't mean

23:27.697 --> 23:30.992
we've had a breakthrough and
I'm gonna start calling you Mommy.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.410
[sighs]

23:32.494 --> 23:35.747
Looking for someone?
You seem a little anxious yourself.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.750
Well, let's just say
I have a dilemma of my own.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.129
Sometimes it helps to run
your problems by someone else.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.463
Well, that is true.

23:44.089 --> 23:48.009
If only there were someone I
respected enough to do that with.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.889
Well, what a surprise
to see you here.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.433
I could say the same.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.436
That's just funny,
considering your past with Blake

23:58.520 --> 24:00.272
and your present with Fallon.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.732
She mentioned that
she broke things off with you.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.819
Yeah, but we're still
in business together.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.739
-She still has some respect for me.
-Boys, that's enough.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.951
-Let's go play at another table.
-No. That's okay.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.369
I was just leaving.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.998
Don't forget
to return that suit by noon.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.959
Those late fees'll
put a hurt in your pockets.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.596
[Melissa] A lovely party, Cristal.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.724
To second wives everywhere.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.311
I hope you and the senator
are enjoying yourselves.

24:39.686 --> 24:44.024
Yes, especially Paul. He's there getting
frisky with one of his regulars.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.611
You know, he bought that tramp
a condo in Brookhaven last year,

24:47.694 --> 24:50.447
but I guess the hotel bills
were just too much.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.784
I'm really sorry, Melissa.
You deserve so much better.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.120
Oh, well,
the marriage died years ago.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.581
But the one thing I really miss

24:59.664 --> 25:02.918
are the trips to Bora Bora
courtesy of Blake Carrington.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.338
That family villa there
is just exquisite.

25:06.922 --> 25:10.258
He takes the tramp now.
That bitch always has a tan.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.968
-Courtesy of Blake?
-Yes.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.388
I mean, paying for trips
is a lot less conspicuous

25:15.472 --> 25:18.475
than writing out checks
with "Bribe" in the memo.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.852
Blake said it only happened once.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.355
You really are adorable.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.273
No.

25:25.690 --> 25:29.444
Their little quid pro bro
has been going on for years.

25:29.527 --> 25:32.322
Why do you think
you're hosting this fundraiser?

25:32.405 --> 25:35.450
Because sometimes
the villa just isn't enough.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.919
Yeah. You were right.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.172
Cash separates
the kids from the grown-ups.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.717
It gets the blood pumping a lot more
than playing for raffle tickets.

25:52.801 --> 25:56.096
Sure, when you're winning.
But since I'm down ten stacks,

25:56.179 --> 25:58.807
it feels more like
getting fed to the sharks.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.684
Do you feel sorry for me?

26:15.949 --> 26:19.577
I'll tell you what, how about we
make things more interesting?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.623
It depends on what we're wagering.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.543
Well, you still want that lease
for $10 million a month, right?

26:26.626 --> 26:30.255
You've piqued my interest.
And if I lose, what do you get?

26:32.215 --> 26:33.049
I get you.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.141
-You like to gamble.
-With money.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.393
I knew you were a perv.
I should've put money on that.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.520
Well, what can I say?
You got a great ass.

26:45.603 --> 26:49.357
-That bacon was just a lucky cover.
-Your luck's running out.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.568
-That mean we have a bet?
-That's a hard no.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.070
What are you doing here?
You said you weren't gonna come.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.114
You're not seriously considering
pimping yourself out

26:56.197 --> 26:57.991
-to this lech, are you?
-Excuse me?

26:58.742 --> 27:02.537
Look, Ben Turner and his brother
will be here any minute.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.165
Ditch this loser
and come hang out with us.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.669
What? All of a sudden
you care about my well-being?

27:09.753 --> 27:11.588
You didn't give a crap
about me yesterday.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.759
-I'm not gonna let you play yourself.
-I don't need your permission.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.177
You're on.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.199
Come on. It's Casino Night.
We didn't come here to sit shiva.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.493
-Let's play.
-I don't really know how.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.788
-I never gambled before.
-You're joking.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.457
-No cards, no craps, no nothing?
-No.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.876
Okay. That changes right now.

27:50.251 --> 27:53.046
I don't exactly have cash
to burn at the moment.

27:53.129 --> 27:56.216
Well, good thing I swiped these

27:56.299 --> 27:58.551
from the drunk guy
with the bad toupee.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.928
That narrows it down.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.181
All right. Come on.
One game won't kill you.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.725
Pick a color.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.395
-Put it all on red.
-Okay.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.437
Yeah.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.106
-All good?
-Yeah. [speaking in Spanish]

28:19.406 --> 28:20.907
See. What did I tell you?

28:21.658 --> 28:24.911
So what? That doesn't mean
it wasn't worth playing.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.205
And that excitement you felt,
while the wheel was spinning,

28:27.288 --> 28:30.291
that's life screaming,
"Everything's possible."

28:30.875 --> 28:33.795
And just because it stops,
doesn't mean it's over.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.588
It just means you...

28:36.423 --> 28:38.758
stand up and spin again.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.970
I'm pretty sure that's the same
voice gambling addicts hear.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.599
All I know is if you bet
on yourself, you can never lose.

28:49.769 --> 28:50.603
Come on, guys.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.907
Hard to entertain guests
sequestered in here.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.995
-I was just--
-Reading my e-mails?

29:08.288 --> 29:12.167
Trying to prove you weren't involving
Carrington Atlantic in anything illegal.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.503
But you're too smart
to leave a digital trail.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.922
Luckily,
I can read between the lines.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.884
You lied about
bribing Daniels only once.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.762
-Why?
-Carrington Atlantic is constantly

29:23.845 --> 29:27.182
being hit with lawsuits that have
to be handled quickly and quietly.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.018
I have to take gambles in order
for this business to thrive.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.187
That does not absolve you, Blake.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.774
How could you do that?

29:35.982 --> 29:39.694
How could you lie to my face?
And now your secrets

29:39.778 --> 29:42.113
could bring down
this company and our family. My secrets?
And what about your secrets?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.243
Where do I start?
Your sex tape with Matthew,

29:47.327 --> 29:49.245
or your crazy sister, or your real name?

29:49.829 --> 29:53.583
I stood by you no matter what
your past brought on this house.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.295
I'd hoped that you
would do the same.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.222
-Oh, Cristal.
-Hi, Bob.

30:07.305 --> 30:11.518
I hear you've been looking for me.
What was it you wanted to ask me?

30:16.022 --> 30:18.149
How do I know you won't
renege on the deal if I win?

30:18.233 --> 30:20.819
You don't.
Yet another reason not to do it.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.446
-Who is she?
-Former friend, current foe.

30:24.030 --> 30:27.617
She has a point. I'm gonna
need your offer in writing. Pen.

30:27.700 --> 30:32.413
-You expect me to call my lawyer?
-No. No need. I was pre-law at Wharton.

30:32.997 --> 30:36.042
I don't know why you're so worried.
Even if you lose, you still win.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.338
-Best night of your life, I promise.
-My mother used to tell me

30:40.421 --> 30:44.509
never make promises you can't keep.
It's rude and impolite.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.852
You expect me to throw in my
box seats for the Falcons, too?

30:53.935 --> 30:57.814
Oh, come on, Tim. Don't tell me
you're all hat and no cattle.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.691
I think it's still a fair bet.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.332
Let's play some poker.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.882
Steven. How are you, son?
I've been looking for you all night.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.384
-Senator.
-I'll take another Scotch. Neat.

31:28.177 --> 31:30.513
Oh, no. He's not a waiter.
He's family.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.057
-This is Cristal's nephew, Sam.
-Oh.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.060
And even if I could vote,
it wouldn't be for you.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.983
That's why I need
your support now more than ever.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.986
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
our politics don't line up.

31:45.778 --> 31:49.073
Listen, Steve,
siding with those bleeding hearts

31:49.157 --> 31:52.410
is sentencing yourself
to a lifetime on the losing team.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.496
They haven't figured out that
people want results.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.541
You can't take
power by playing nice.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.170
You gotta be ruthless and grab it.
Your way doesn't work.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.924
Is that what you really believe?
This is just a game?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.884
[laughs] Well...

32:08.468 --> 32:11.763
If you really think that life
isn't us versus them, well,

32:12.263 --> 32:14.974
you and your generation
don't stand a chance.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.102
Save your scare tactics.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.064
I'm done making bets
in a burning house.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.410
Is this your idea of negotiating?

32:34.744 --> 32:38.581
Just trust me. I'm about to win us
our land lease at a fair price.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.668
-You're gambling with our company?
-Not exactly.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.419
-What?
-Shh.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.931
I'll show you mine,
if you show me yours.

32:55.515 --> 32:56.349
How about...

32:57.183 --> 32:58.977
we up the stakes even further?

33:00.728 --> 33:02.814
-You wanna raise me?
-How about...

33:03.564 --> 33:05.066
instead of $10 million...

33:06.067 --> 33:08.987
you give us the land lease
for one dollar a month?

33:09.070 --> 33:12.240
You want me to put $240 million
on one hand of poker?

33:16.035 --> 33:19.247
-How will you match it?
-You wanted a night with me.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.375
How about a weekend in Vegas?

33:22.959 --> 33:24.836
All the bacon you can eat.

33:33.302 --> 33:34.929
[sighs]

33:36.180 --> 33:38.266
I guess we both lose tonight,
honey.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.520
You can have the lease
for $10 mil.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.397
[people clapping]

33:47.525 --> 33:48.651
Out of curiosity...

33:50.528 --> 33:51.612
what did you have?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.240
More balls than you, Tim.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.743
That's why I'll always win.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.498
Hey.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.586
-Thanks for bailing me out.
-Glad my signal worked.

34:06.669 --> 34:09.422
It's funny. I haven't thought about
Ben Turner since graduation.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.259
-Who is Ben Turner?
-Homecoming king, our freshman year.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.261
He and his twin brother
shared the title.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.263
First and only time that happened.

34:17.346 --> 34:20.725
So, when Monica dropped his
name, I knew Tim had two kings.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.478
That's the only reason I took the
bet. I thought I could beat him.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.731
Guess it pays to have
so much history with one person.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.400
I'm gonna go get another drink.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.112
You're lucky, you know?

34:33.487 --> 34:35.739
That creep could have
drawn something to beat you,

34:35.822 --> 34:37.949
and I thought you were
gonna fold once I tipped you off.

34:38.034 --> 34:41.036
-You must've had one hell of a hand.
-I had nothing.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.789
I knew I could bluff my way through it.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.916
Like any successful negotiation,
all I had to do

34:44.998 --> 34:46.793
was make him believe
that I could beat him,

34:46.876 --> 34:50.129
even if I didn't stand a chance.
Plus, with the legalese

34:50.213 --> 34:52.297
I put in our contract,
he'd win a night in my bed.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.674
Doesn't mean
I have to be in it.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.430
I'm glad
you had a change of heart.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.849
I thought a lot about your apology.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.186
I know those don't come easy
for you, so it meant a lot.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.395
You deserve better.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.524
I've made some
bad decisions of my own.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.318
But I've known you for so long,
it's like you're my sister.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.779
That would mean me
sleeping with Jeff was incest.

35:14.862 --> 35:17.490
Why do you have to ruin
every genuine moment?

35:17.573 --> 35:20.118
Because I'm emotionally scarred,
obviously.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.286
Yet you can't help but love me.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.804
-Thanks for that, Moni.
-That wasn't for you.

35:41.556 --> 35:42.390
That was.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.903
Good morning, Mrs. Carrington.

35:56.112 --> 35:59.240
-Can I pour you a cup of tea?
-Yes. Thank you, Anders.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.876
Rather chilly in here this morning.
Perhaps I should light the fire.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.130
What's this?

36:14.213 --> 36:17.633
Some breaking news I thought
you'd wanna see. Thank you.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.766
"Senator Daniels involved
in a string of extra-marital affairs.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.144
Ends his re-election campaign

36:28.936 --> 36:31.022
to spend more time
with his family."

36:33.316 --> 36:36.444
No need to light a fire, Anders.
It looks like my wife

36:36.777 --> 36:39.405
has that handled.
Would you give us a moment?

36:44.410 --> 36:47.330
-Cristal, I asked--
-You asked me to stand by you,

36:47.413 --> 36:50.249
the way you stood by me.
And that's what I did.

36:50.833 --> 36:54.962
I protected you from the scandal,
but I had to protect my integrity.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.382
That meant ending Daniels'
campaign, one way or another.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.721
I'm sorry you felt
that I wasn't being supportive.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.723
I will always be there for you.

37:06.974 --> 37:10.478
I want that you to be the best version
of Blake that you can be.

37:13.522 --> 37:16.651
Yeah. I know that you
think I'm set in my ways, but...

37:19.946 --> 37:20.947
I agree with you.

37:22.448 --> 37:23.282
Smart move...

37:24.867 --> 37:27.328
feeding your source
one story for another.

37:27.828 --> 37:31.290
-I shouldn't expect anything less.
-No, you shouldn't.

37:34.168 --> 37:35.169
[knocking on door] [Steven groans]

37:37.171 --> 37:39.632
Don't worry.
I'm not here to therapize.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.928
-I'm just dropping this off.
-We have to start locking the doors.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.973
Oh, yeah. Someone might wanna
steal your particle board shelving.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.184
Now that I'm on the other side
of my post-kidnapping-stress,

37:50.268 --> 37:52.186
I just wanted to thank you
for lending an ear.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.314
I brought you
a homemade lunch this time.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.110
Huh. Funny, looks like leftovers
from last night's party.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.446
Well, by homemade,
I mean I curated an assortment

38:02.530 --> 38:04.865
of fine foods at home
and a maid provided the basket.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.158
Just say thank you.

38:06.242 --> 38:09.287
I don't care who made it just as
long as it makes it to my mouth.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.456
Considering I'm without an assistant,
these kind acts aren't easy for me.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.500
-Wait. You need an assistant?
-No.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.086
-As your first step cousin--
-Gross.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.880
I may not have
a fancy business degree

38:19.964 --> 38:23.843
from one of your rich-people schools,
but I know about supply and demand.

38:23.926 --> 38:27.138
Yes. We keep supplying you
with room, board, and bubbly,

38:27.221 --> 38:29.056
-and you keep demanding.
-You demand assistance

38:29.140 --> 38:30.516
from someone
who speaks your language,

38:30.599 --> 38:32.268
and I can provide just that.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.896
For instance, you skillfully
paired the Beluga Caviar

38:35.980 --> 38:37.398
with French champagne,

38:37.481 --> 38:40.526
but you also
packed metal flatware.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.570
Now, if I was your assistant,
I would've made sure

38:42.653 --> 38:43.946
to include
mother-of-pearl spoons

38:44.030 --> 38:46.866
so as to not ruin
the caviar with metal taste.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.369
-He does make a good point.
-Okay, Mister Mother of Pearl,

38:50.453 --> 38:52.705
answer me one question.
Taylor or Katy?

38:52.788 --> 38:56.625
Easy. Fallon. Real bosses
don't insert themselves

38:56.709 --> 38:58.419
into fights
that don't involve them.

38:59.962 --> 39:02.340
-You're hired.
-What just happened?

39:02.423 --> 39:03.424
I just got a job.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.468
Oh, speaking of jobs,

39:05.551 --> 39:08.054
Daddy said you just took one
for Greg Anderson's company?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.848
Actually, I changed
my mind about everything.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.058
-You're coming home?
-We're going home?

39:12.141 --> 39:12.975
No.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.353
After listening to Daniels

39:15.436 --> 39:18.105
spin his web
of discrimination and arrogance,

39:18.189 --> 39:19.273
I got to thinking. I'm done fighting a system

39:21.317 --> 39:23.277
that's just gonna protect
the 1 percent anyway.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.862
I'm ready to change it.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.782
It's time to bet on myself. I'm running for office.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.416
What's all this?

39:37.500 --> 39:40.711
Oh, well, I was told that people
bring food to you now,

39:42.129 --> 39:44.799
-so, consider it a thank you.
-Looks delicious.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.301
But you shouldn't
be thanking me.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.721
I kept you from running
a really great piece.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.641
No. You gave me
a far more salacious story

39:53.724 --> 39:56.143
filled with sex, betrayal.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.898
But Channing loved it
and online views are soaring, so--

40:00.981 --> 40:03.651
Of course they are.
People love a personal scandal

40:03.734 --> 40:05.653
-way more than a political one.
-End of the day,

40:05.736 --> 40:08.989
the story stopped Daniels'
election campaign in its tracks.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.992
So, that's all
that really mattered to me.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.204
Would've been nice
to put him in prison though.

40:16.539 --> 40:19.083
-I just-- I couldn't--
-Destroy your family?

40:19.166 --> 40:20.042
I get it.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.755
-I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner.
-Thank you for understanding.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.299
And I applaud your stellar reporting.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.259
-[scoffs]
-No, really.

40:28.342 --> 40:32.638
I'm not the only one that's come
a long way. I am so proud of you.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.598
[both chuckle]

40:36.600 --> 40:38.519
I'm, uh-- I'm gonna get going.

40:40.187 --> 40:43.107
-You're not gonna stay for lunch?
-No, you know,

40:43.190 --> 40:46.861
I got stories to crack,
bad guys to catch, you know.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.405
The citizens of Atlanta
are counting on you.

40:49.488 --> 40:53.784
Stellar reporter, huh? Guess I'll have
to keep an eye on Carrington Atlantic.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.916
Meditating on another takeover?

41:01.750 --> 41:04.795
Or maybe just envisioning
the ousting of a dictator?

41:05.921 --> 41:10.551
Come to take another crack at me?
What the hell was that? We're family.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.303
Family doesn't keep
secrets from each other.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.388
I thought you'd understand
what I was trying to accomplish.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.140
This whole time
that Dad was in jail,

41:16.223 --> 41:19.143
I was convinced that
he had turned his back on me.

41:19.351 --> 41:20.519
I hated him for it.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.439
When Culhane invited me
to the Carringtons' fundraiser,

41:23.522 --> 41:25.691
I couldn't help
but think about what you said,

41:26.317 --> 41:28.944
how they are the reason that
we were raised without a father,

41:29.028 --> 41:31.238
how all these years they've
taken us under their wing,

41:31.322 --> 41:33.324
pretending to be our friends,

41:33.407 --> 41:36.285
giving us scholarships,
inviting us to parties.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.330
And now you wanna make them
pay for what they've done?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.374
Well, so do I.

41:43.709 --> 41:44.543
What?

41:46.128 --> 41:48.172
After that slap I thought--

41:48.255 --> 41:49.673
Culhane was watching
your every move,

41:50.508 --> 41:53.344
including how you congratulated me
about Fallon.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.263
So, I had to sell a different story.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.432
Damn, Monica.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.268
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me yet.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.687
We're just getting started.
