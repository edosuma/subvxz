WEBVTT

00:04.204 --> 00:06.968
[laughs] Yeah. So he goes,
''You should go out with me.''

00:07.073 --> 00:09.439
So, then she goes,
''Go out with you?''

00:09.542 --> 00:12.033
So, then l go,
''Yeah. You should go.''

00:12.112 --> 00:14.580
And then l go,
''You're an idiot.''

00:15.382 --> 00:17.942
- Come on. We need to use the phone.
- [door opens]

00:18.018 --> 00:19.781
Well, guys,

00:19.886 --> 00:22.446
l just did my first
oil change on the Healey.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.548
Congratulations.
How'd you manage to stay so clean?

00:31.498 --> 00:34.023
She used me for a drop cloth.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.158
And a shop rag.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.861
Now l gotta change.
l had better call Harry.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.373
l was supposed to be there
five minutes ago.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.275
- Take a number.
- No. Brittany's not Heather's friend.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.246
She's Ashley's friend.
Heather hangs out with Courtney

00:48.314 --> 00:51.806
ever since they came to school
wearing the same pair of earrings.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.778
l can't stand this.
When l want the phone,

00:54.854 --> 00:58.221
one of my strapping young boys
is clucking like a hen on the phone.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.985
[clucking]

01:00.060 --> 01:02.585
l think l have a solution.
Brad, get off the phone.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.994
All right, yeah.
l gotta go. Later.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.396
Mark, wait!

01:06.466 --> 01:09.026
None of you is using the phone
until we work out

01:09.102 --> 01:11.969
a system of phone usage for you boys.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.666
- All right, listen up.
- OK, it's very simple.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.710
Each of you will be allotted
45 minutes a day of phone time.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.905
You can't use it continuously
unless nobody else is waiting.

01:20.980 --> 01:24.472
These rules don't apply during
peak times, 9:00 to 5:00 on weekdays,

01:24.551 --> 01:26.712
all day on the weekend,
and when we are home.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.756
Also, keep in mind,
if you fail to use your daily allotment,

01:30.824 --> 01:33.952
you can't apply that
to future phone usage.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.551
Does that sound fair, Tim?

01:35.628 --> 01:38.256
l lost you after
''it's all very simple.''

Delores! You want to get Tim
another beer, please?

02:40.560 --> 02:43.495
l just got off work.
l'm starving to death.

02:43.563 --> 02:47.693
And my feet are swelled up
like a couple of bloated toads.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.395
ls that a ''yes'' or a ''no?''

02:53.606 --> 02:56.097
- Hey, l'll get it.
- Absolutely not.

02:56.676 --> 03:00.442
You're a guest in this house.
You shouldn't have to get your own beer.

03:08.087 --> 03:12.456
But l'm so comfortable as a gosh-darn
guest here, l prefer to get my own beer.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.089
Get me one, too?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.921
[knocking]

03:27.373 --> 03:29.637
Heck! Why don't l get it.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.904
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey, Tim.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.949
- Need a hand?
- l got it. How you doing?

03:37.016 --> 03:39.849
lt's been a long time.
Last time l saw you, you had the...

03:39.919 --> 03:41.284
lt's all healed, yeah.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.447
- Hey, Dad. Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

03:44.524 --> 03:47.288
lf you came by to watch hockey,
it's not much of a game.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.884
The Wings are down by seven goals.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.490
Actually, l came in to hook the
power supply up for the video phone.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.330
- Video phone?
- Yeah. Dennis has one at his place.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.427
He also put one in
at the hardware store.

03:58.504 --> 04:02.031
Yeah. Delores loves it.
l call it ''Must-Nag TV.''

04:04.143 --> 04:07.840
l work for a communications company
that installs high-tech systems.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.213
Good company. Last time we talked,
you were selling real estate.

04:11.284 --> 04:15.220
Yeah, he was. But then he was a
salesman, then he was a bank teller,

04:15.288 --> 04:17.119
and then a waiter...

04:17.190 --> 04:20.716
Oh, and then he went
into his human guinea pig period.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.461
But he's found a career
he really loves, right?

04:24.564 --> 04:28.022
Yeah. lt's awesome. l mean,
the technology's changing every day.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.865
- l read a lot...
- And l'm smack dab in the middle of it!

04:30.970 --> 04:34.599
- Congratulations...
- l get paid for it! lt's a cool job.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.006
Boy, you're perky, Dennis!

04:39.245 --> 04:41.713
Yeah. He takes after his mother.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.810
Shut up, Harry!

04:47.053 --> 04:49.487
Do you install those
automated-home systems?

04:49.555 --> 04:53.924
l install those all the time. l can
automate anything my customers want.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.895
Yeah? What if l wanted
to flush my toilet from the car?

04:59.232 --> 05:02.793
Then you'd be a strange, strange man.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.629
You should have him
automate your house.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.434
Hey! Don't start, Delores!

05:07.507 --> 05:10.032
Tim doesn't like to be pushed
into buying things.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.373
Oh, yes, l do.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.937
l don't think l could talk Jill into
it. We need is a second phone line.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.949
- l could put that in for you.
- [sighs]

05:18.017 --> 05:19.917
l don't know, Tim.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.149
lt's not a good idea having
your kid work for your friends.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.157
- That's what friends are for.
- Think you can do it?

05:26.225 --> 05:29.854
Sure, while l'm there maybe l can
sell you on one of these video phones.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.897
- Does this thing work?
- Check it out.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.935
<i>- l'll speed dial the hardware store.
- Hello. Harry's Hardware. This is Al.</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:44.274
You know, there's just some
things you don't want to see.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.241
Just a second phone line.
That's all, right?

05:48.314 --> 05:51.340
- Yeah. Just a second phone line.
- All right.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.975
- As long as he's here...
- No.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.883
- Can't we just try...
- No.

05:54.954 --> 05:56.512
- Just think...
- No! No!

05:56.622 --> 05:58.522
- Home automated system!
- No!

05:59.726 --> 06:02.627
All right. l'll call and
talk about a second phone line.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.664
- Just a second line.
- But if we could just...

06:05.732 --> 06:07.495
No! Never!

06:12.538 --> 06:14.062
Mark's on the phone.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.904
What? He's been on the phone all day.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.977
l told him an hour ago
no more calls.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.706
[sighs]

06:22.415 --> 06:25.384
Mark, did your mom tell you
an hour ago to get off the phone?

06:25.451 --> 06:28.818
Yeah. Well, stop the girlie chitchat
and get off the phone.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.283
Big news! Katie likes Trevor!

06:37.130 --> 06:40.031
Katie likes Trevor?
l thought Katie liked Justin.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.590
And then Justin likes Chloe.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.532
You gotta let this go.

06:49.809 --> 06:53.267
Dad, don't you ever do that again!
That was a really important call.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.975
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Not my friends, thanks to you!

06:57.417 --> 06:59.647
Mark, l told you 45
minutes was the limit.

06:59.719 --> 07:03.018
- You won't play by the rules?
- lt's a stupid rule!

07:03.089 --> 07:05.956
Stupid rule? How about three days
without phone calls?

07:06.025 --> 07:08.585
- Dad! That's a...
- Argue with me, it'll be a week!

07:08.661 --> 07:11.027
[sighs] This bites!

07:11.097 --> 07:15.431
Oh, yeah? How about three weeks without
a phone call? That'll... that'll ''bite!''

07:18.771 --> 07:20.398
[sighs]

07:20.473 --> 07:23.237
Three weeks? Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

07:23.309 --> 07:26.210
- What would you have done?
- Given him a warning.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.646
You give me warnings all the time.
Does it ever do any good?

07:30.850 --> 07:33.717
No. But l still have
hope for the children.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.524
Whoever did your last wiring job
really didn't know what he was doing.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.595
Well, that guy's not allowed to work
around here anymore.

07:47.667 --> 07:52.036
lt's too bad. Now all l gotta do
is run the fish tape upstairs,

07:52.104 --> 07:54.265
hook it to the new line
and yank it through.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.706
Right. l can give you
a hand if you want.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.870
You said ''that guy'' wasn't
allowed to work here anymore.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.079
<i>- [pager beeps]
- Ooh.</i>

08:03.549 --> 08:05.915
Um... oh, man!

08:05.985 --> 08:09.944
l got a customer that needs me. l want
to get that job done right. l'm sorry.

08:10.022 --> 08:13.185
Think you'll be OK without
a second line for a little while?

08:13.259 --> 08:15.750
- You still got the first line.
- That'd be great.

08:15.828 --> 08:20.322
l haven't actually used the first line
since Katie started dating Justin.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.373
This is ridiculous.
Dennis has been gone for three hours.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.069
And Mom won't get off the phone.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.509
[sighs] Angela's probably
married by now.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.576
By the time l get to use the phone,
my friends'll be in a retirement home.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.619
[pretending to cry]

08:41.453 --> 08:44.890
Mark, quit exaggerating.
You don't have any friends.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.662
Guys, listen up.

08:50.763 --> 08:54.597
l think l can pull that second line down
by myself if you help me upstairs.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.397
l'll hook it on the tape,
wrap it around, send it down.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.961
Use the intercom to talk.
You distract Mom.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.497
Big arms, big gestures. Big hands!
Big hands! Big hands! Big hands!

09:03.576 --> 09:04.702
Gotcha!

[Tim whistles]

09:12.184 --> 09:14.744
Moving, moving...

09:14.854 --> 09:16.822
Get in there.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.184
Uh-oh.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.159
Not a word you want to hear
in this house.

09:29.168 --> 09:33.298
<i>- Brad. lt's hung up on something.
- [Brad] I don't see anything.</i>

09:33.372 --> 09:37.308
All right, l'm gonna pull it back out.
We'll try it one more time.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.812
[whispers] Big arms.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.891
[Jill] The phone went dead.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.892
Oh, my God! What happened?

09:59.198 --> 10:02.463
Well, looks like Dad just yanked away
all our phone privileges.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.504
Tim, why couldn't you
wait till Dennis got here?

10:06.572 --> 10:10.633
l waited three hours! l can only wait
so long having a hole in the wall!

10:10.710 --> 10:12.974
- [doorbell]
- There's Dennis. He'll fix it.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.411
- l'll get some drywall patch.
- [Harry] Hi.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.948
l just came to bring
Dennis his lunch and say...

10:18.017 --> 10:20.986
What the hell happened?

10:21.053 --> 10:23.487
Tim tried to fix the phone.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.415
Where's Dennis?

10:25.491 --> 10:28.358
He was paged. He's been gone
about three hours. So...

10:28.427 --> 10:31.988
- He left in the middle of the job?
- Yeah. But Tim tried to finish it.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.658
-[knocking]
- Hey, guys.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.067
Hey, Dad. Sorry l'm late.
Whoa! What happened?

10:38.904 --> 10:41.202
That guy showed up.

10:43.275 --> 10:47.177
How could you leave my friend
stranded for three hours?

10:47.246 --> 10:50.374
l got paged on another job.
l guess l got a little overbooked.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.748
- He's here now. No big deal.
- lt's a very big deal.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.084
You know you can't leave Tim alone
with a hole in the wall.

10:58.357 --> 11:01.656
- Told you so.
- Listen, l gotta get back to work.

11:01.727 --> 11:05.891
Yes, you do. And l'm gonna stay here
to make sure you do it right this time.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.332
- You're gonna breathe down my neck?
- You're damn right l am!

11:09.402 --> 11:12.963
- Guys, settle down, please?
- Don't have to be so tough on him.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.200
Our walls always look like this.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.373
Dad, would you just trust
me to do this by myself?

11:19.445 --> 11:21.811
l'd trust you to screw it up.

11:21.914 --> 11:25.816
- That's it. l'm out of here.
- Fine. Run away.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.181
No, it's not fine.
Don't run away, Dennis.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.018
l'm sorry. l'll send somebody
out to finish the job.

11:31.123 --> 11:34.092
Make sure that somebody else
knows what they're doing.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.185
Aw, the hell with it.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.035
<i>[Brad] Dad?</i>

11:47.106 --> 11:48.403
What?

11:48.474 --> 11:50.704
<i>[Brad] What should I do?</i>

11:51.343 --> 11:54.039
Take up the lost art
of letter-writing.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.520
[floor creaks]

12:12.064 --> 12:14.157
Don't even think about it!

12:16.535 --> 12:19.629
l can't believe the way
Harry went after Dennis.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.640
He just went after him
because he cares about him.

12:22.708 --> 12:26.371
What do you think he'd be like if
Harry didn't come down so hard on him?

12:26.445 --> 12:28.606
l don't know... happy?

12:28.714 --> 12:33.811
Happy? What would the world be like
if everyone walked around ''happy?''

12:34.720 --> 12:36.585
A happy world?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.216
lt's important for kids
to be responsible.

12:41.293 --> 12:44.057
Dennis was three hours late.
He screwed up.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.132
lt was Harry's job as a parent
to straighten things out.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.758
Like you tried to straighten out Mark?

12:49.835 --> 12:51.860
What does that
have to do with anything?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.770
You were pretty tough
on him about the phone.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.070
Thanks to me,
he's not talking on the phone.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.407
Thanks to you, nobody is.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.844
This isn't just about the phone,
you know.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.383
You heard him come down with that
attitude. l had to say something.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.410
As the kids get older, the problems
and attitudes are just gonna get bigger.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.457
You have to pick your battles
and be more sensitive.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.686
[sighs] You know,
you probably are right, you know?

13:15.761 --> 13:17.922
Next time one of the boys
smarts off to me,

13:18.030 --> 13:21.898
l'm gonna take him out for a nice
little cup of tea.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.836
And while they're
buttering their scones,

13:26.906 --> 13:29.739
l'll ask what punishment
they would prefer.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.907
You won't laugh when you end up with
a relationship like Dennis and Harry.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.413
l have a good relationship
with the boys.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.918
l'm not gonna end up like Harry.
l know what l'm doing around here.

13:50.596 --> 13:53.326
- Hey, Wilson.
- [Wilson] Hidey-ho, neighbor.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.163
- [rattling]
- What are you doing over there?

13:56.268 --> 14:00.432
<i>Tim, are you familiar with
the I Ching?</i>

14:01.006 --> 14:03.975
Sure. The ''l Ching,'' the scratching,
the chafing.

14:06.912 --> 14:10.075
That's why l switched
to boxers, my friend.

14:10.149 --> 14:13.414
[Wilson laughs] Oh, my! No.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.545
<i>Actually, the I Ching is the
ancient book of Chinese wisdom.</i>

14:16.622 --> 14:20.752
You ask a question about your life.
And then you toss these coins.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.151
And you try to divine
the answer from the book.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.430
- l've got a question for those coins.
- Mmm. Shoot.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.434
You think l'm too tough on my kids?

14:30.502 --> 14:33.335
Might l inquire what
brings that issue to the fence?

14:33.405 --> 14:36.033
ln a word? Jill.

14:38.277 --> 14:42.213
She says l should be more sensitive
about how l discipline my kids.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.977
Well, it's true the way
you talk to your children now

14:45.050 --> 14:47.951
can have a profound effect
on your future relationship.

14:48.020 --> 14:51.581
l say some tough things, but not
as tough as Harry says to his kid.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.956
Oh! Dennis tells me
that Harry has quite a lexicon.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.393
Lexicon? No, he drives a Buick.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.926
You know, l ran into Dennis
at the coffee shop today.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.300
And he was so angry at Harry,
he told him that he was leaving town.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.431
What? Just because
of what Harry said to him?

15:08.507 --> 15:11.340
Well, l guess so.
You know, as Longfellow says,

15:11.410 --> 15:16.040
''A torn jacket is soon mended. But hard
words can bruise the heart of a child.''

15:17.750 --> 15:20.241
You think l should have
a talk with Harry?

15:20.319 --> 15:22.617
<i>Well, let's see what
the I Ching says.</i>

15:23.989 --> 15:26.549
- (sighs)
- [coins clattering]

15:26.625 --> 15:30.686
[repeating] Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.824
Yes. lt says ''The situation is a
microcosm juxtaposed against,

15:34.900 --> 15:37.801
and created by, the macrocosm
of the universe.''

15:37.870 --> 15:39.633
[Wilson sniffs]

15:40.472 --> 15:43.168
And there, my neighbor,
you have your answer.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.271
Yup.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.507
Though l've forgotten the question.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.387
Hey, Mark.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.357
Mark, do me a favor.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.658
When Mom comes home, tell her
l went to Harry's for a minute.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.493
Whatever you say.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.400
l know you're angry because
l disciplined you over the phone.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.440
And because you embarrassed me.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.676
You know, l probably
shouldn't have done that.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.645
But it gave you no right
to talk to me the way you did.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.172
Yeah. You're right. l'm sorry.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.981
Feel like playing by the rules now?

16:29.221 --> 16:30.347
Yeah.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.118
You can use the phone
as soon as it gets fixed.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.854
When will that be?

16:36.929 --> 16:40.262
Well, very soon. Provided l
don't get anywhere near it.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.599
[Delores] My little sweetie.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.005
You can dust yourself.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.668
[doorbell]

16:52.745 --> 16:55.077
- Hi, Delores.
- What do you want?

16:55.147 --> 16:57.775
Well, l heard about
Dennis wanting to move away.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.011
And l came over
to talk to Harry about it.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.484
Let me get this straight.

17:01.553 --> 17:04.521
You're taking it upon yourself
to fix our family problems?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.954
Not if you're gonna yell at me.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.087
- Tim, you're a marvelous person.
- No, no...

17:11.163 --> 17:14.929
Would you like a beer? Some cheese
and crackers? Can l glaze you a ham?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.901
- Oh...
- l thought if they talked. lf they...

17:17.970 --> 17:20.200
Tim?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.939
- What are you doing here?
- Certainly not what it looks like.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.013
He came over because
he's a caring, loving human being

17:29.081 --> 17:31.811
who recognizes the importance
of family unity.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.250
Are you drunk?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.514
l'm gonna leave you two alone.

17:36.588 --> 17:40.718
Now, try and open that thick skull of
yours and listen to what he has to say.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.886
He's a lot smarter than he looks.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.593
l want to talk to you about Dennis.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.760
Look, nothing you can say
could possibly change my mind.

17:50.836 --> 17:54.203
Well, how about some
words of wisdom from

17:54.306 --> 17:57.275
Longfellow during his itching period?

17:57.810 --> 18:01.678
He said don't ''jucapose'' anything
in a ''macroscope'' in this universe.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.546
Are you drunk?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.148
What l'm saying is your kid is
about ready to leave your life.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.987
- ls that what you want?
- lt doesn't matter what l want.

18:14.059 --> 18:18.553
lt never mattered what l want. l wanted
him to go to college, he dropped out.

18:18.630 --> 18:22.566
Then l wanted him to learn the hardware
business but he wasn't interested.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.398
Maybe the kid's just
looking for a career of his own.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.338
You know, l think he's
found one that he's good at.

18:28.407 --> 18:29.840
- Good at?
- Yeah.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.876
He walked out in the middle of a job!

18:31.977 --> 18:36.414
l can't even begin to imagine leaving
a customer waiting for three hours.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.643
- How about three weeks?
- What?

18:38.750 --> 18:42.083
When you forgot to order that grinder
for me, l did the job by hand.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.122
[sighs] One mistake.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.555
Well, the kid's allowed
to make one mistake.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.992
His mistake is he's got
too many customers.

18:50.062 --> 18:54.226
Too many customers. That means he
must be doing something right.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.063
Yeah. He was always good with his hands.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.502
Why wouldn't he be?
He takes after his old man.

18:59.571 --> 19:03.439
[grunts] Maybe l should
give him another chance.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.477
You bet you should.
Give the kid a call.

19:05.544 --> 19:09.173
How do l know he's not already
on a plane halfway across the country?

19:09.248 --> 19:12.081
Because l've got him on hold.
Pick up the video phone.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.414
[repeating] No. Tim, no. No, no, no.
l don't want to talk to him.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.954
No, no, no, no...

19:17.022 --> 19:19.354
Hey, hey, Dennis. Hi.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.324
<i>Hi.</i>

19:22.261 --> 19:25.526
Look, l'm sorry l came down
so hard on you.

19:26.899 --> 19:31.427
<i>My screen's a little fuzzy. For a second
there I thought you were my father.</i>

19:31.503 --> 19:35.462
l mean it. Look,
l don't want you moving away.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.340
lt would upset your mother...

19:38.443 --> 19:39.705
...and...

19:39.778 --> 19:42.338
[laughs] ...it would upset me, too.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.348
And it would really upset me...

19:45.884 --> 19:48.011
...because l got that
big hole in my wall.

19:48.820 --> 19:53.655
You know what you need? A responsible
professional to help you out.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.693
And l think l know just the guy.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.421
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

19:58.530 --> 20:00.862
Tool Man, l'm gonna glaze you that ham.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.596
Glaze away, baby.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.438
<i>- Hi.
- Welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:15.070
We're here with home
communication expert, Dennis Turner.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.220
Today we're talking about
the fully automated house.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.915
Heidi, let's show
them our fully automated house.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.517
- Here you are, Tim.
- [trumpets blaring]

20:28.594 --> 20:31.062
- Thank you, Heidi.
- You're welcome.

20:31.129 --> 20:35.065
Actually, this is a mock-up
of an automated house.

20:35.133 --> 20:39.297
Wow, now you tell me! l had half
my stuff moved in there already.

20:39.371 --> 20:43.137
The home is controlled by a touch
screen, hooked into a central computer.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.507
Right. The touch of your finger
can turn on air conditioning,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.546
- your stereo...
- Or your lights.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.384
- Red lights?
- Oops, wrong district.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.781
Well, the great thing
about an automated house

20:58.890 --> 21:01.415
is that you can
customize it to your personality.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.461
This is like an automated doll house.

21:03.562 --> 21:07.020
Of course Al would have
an automated dull house.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.897
What would be so great
about your automated house?

21:10.969 --> 21:12.300
Yeah? l'll show you.

21:12.371 --> 21:15.431
ln my house, let's say l want
my plants to have perfect sun.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.668
Press this plant icon,
and my house rotates

21:17.776 --> 21:21.803
from a northern exposure
to a beautiful sunny western exposure.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.286
Well, l wouldn't want
to be living in a spinning house.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.787
Who invited ya?

21:31.356 --> 21:34.723
Here's a good one. lf your neighbors
put on a two-story addition.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.989
You can't even see
the stockyards anymore. Press this.

21:38.063 --> 21:40.429
And your house
rises to the occasion.

21:42.634 --> 21:46.297
''When you get the paper, honey, watch
that first step. lt's a mean one.''

21:47.306 --> 21:51.265
This feature is also good for keeping
away pesky door-to-door salesmen.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.071
[laughs]

21:55.414 --> 21:57.882
And speaking of keeping
people away from you...

21:57.949 --> 22:02.249
...when the mother-in-law comes, perfect
opportunity to use the automated house.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.482
She's not getting in here. No way.
