WEBVTT

00:00.189 --> 00:02.973
<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

00:03.079 --> 00:05.083
I need you all outside
to do some wipe outs.

00:05.184 --> 00:06.402
Wipe down this!

00:06.541 --> 00:08.378
I heard you broke
new ground today.

00:08.465 --> 00:12.847
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes.
Yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

00:12.980 --> 00:16.015
You worked here four years.
It's a story people would believe.

00:16.197 --> 00:17.536
This is what we buy.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.994
Slow down.
Oh God!

00:26.816 --> 00:29.180
At the first opportunity
Gus will kill us.

00:33.929 --> 00:36.962
So? How does it look?

00:38.630 --> 00:41.864
You mean, in do I see it?

00:41.899 --> 00:43.467
Yes.

00:44.738 --> 00:46.474
Do you see it?

00:49.413 --> 00:51.584
Basically, any lawman
worth his salt's

00:51.618 --> 00:53.118
going to spot that, yeah.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.853
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

00:56.887 --> 00:58.822
Yes.
It's a deal breaker.

01:01.161 --> 01:06.434
Well, if stealth is what
you're aspiring to,

01:06.468 --> 01:10.170
you best go with something
more compact--

01:11.672 --> 01:13.039
.38 Special,

01:13.074 --> 01:14.374
snub nose.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.442
Got a concealed hammer

01:16.476 --> 01:18.977
so it doesn't catch
on your belt when you draw.

01:19.011 --> 01:21.313
Tried and true,
no nonsense about it.

01:24.616 --> 01:26.117
Five shots?
Yep.

01:26.151 --> 01:28.051
Automatic has how many?

01:28.085 --> 01:30.720
Ten in the mag,
one in the chamber.

01:30.754 --> 01:32.388
If you can't get it done
with five,

01:32.422 --> 01:33.956
then you're into spraying prey,

01:33.990 --> 01:36.257
in which case I wouldn't
count on another six

01:36.291 --> 01:38.525
closing the deal.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.129
You load that
with 158 grain hollow points

01:41.163 --> 01:42.831
instead of your standard
wad cutters.

01:42.866 --> 01:44.766
It's got plenty
of stopping power.

01:46.636 --> 01:49.005
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.909
Here.
Um...

01:54.012 --> 01:55.412
Try it on with this.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.587
That snub,
you'll conceal real nice

02:01.621 --> 02:03.655
if you carry it I-W-B.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.757
Little harder to draw from,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.626
but there's really
no substitute

02:06.660 --> 02:09.596
if you're intent of fooling
a vigilant eye.

02:10.632 --> 02:12.433
Comes in polymer, too.

02:12.467 --> 02:15.035
I prefer the feel of leather.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.904
Old school, I guess.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.374
Yeah, um...

02:20.409 --> 02:23.010
You sure it's on
the correct side?

02:23.045 --> 02:24.946
If you're right-handed,
it is.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.647
I don't know, ma--
Are you sure

02:26.681 --> 02:29.516
because maybe it'll feel
better on the left side.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.186
General rule--
You don't want to cross draw,

02:33.221 --> 02:35.555
not unless
you're going to be sitting,

02:35.589 --> 02:39.358
you know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.236
Either way you're going to want
to practice your draw...

02:51.238 --> 02:52.638
a lot...

02:52.672 --> 02:54.906
because if you're all fingers,

02:54.941 --> 02:56.842
well, it might could be him

02:56.876 --> 02:58.209
keeping a piece instead of you.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.544
Catch my drift?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.650
What's this?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.486
That there is why
you're going to pay me

03:07.521 --> 03:09.956
five times what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.928
Serial number
has been filed off.

03:17.332 --> 03:19.566
So...

03:19.601 --> 03:21.101
to state the obvious,

03:21.135 --> 03:23.904
I don't want to be
caught with this on me.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.506
No, sir, to state
the obvious, you don't.

03:27.742 --> 03:29.609
You know, Mister,
I've been providing my services

03:29.643 --> 03:32.211
for the past 30-odd years.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.679
You'd think in that time

03:33.713 --> 03:35.848
I'd learn better than to ask
a man his business,

03:35.882 --> 03:38.250
especially about one
referred by the lawyer,

03:38.284 --> 03:40.619
but I do feel the urge
to ask you,

03:40.653 --> 03:43.288
we strictly talking
defense here?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.727
Yes, absolutely defense.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.097
Why?

03:51.131 --> 03:55.102
Because if it's just
personal protection,

03:55.136 --> 03:58.038
aside from a bucket of money,

03:58.072 --> 04:02.008
you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot

04:02.042 --> 04:04.210
for carrying a weapon
with a defaced serial number

04:04.245 --> 04:06.045
if you'd just buy it legally.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.248
Yeah, but...

04:08.282 --> 04:10.750
if you did have to use it,

04:10.784 --> 04:12.085
wouldn't it still be better

04:12.119 --> 04:13.853
to use one
that couldn't be traced?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.588
This is the west, boss.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.257
New Mexico's
not a retreat jurisdiction.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.726
Man steps to you
bent on doing bodily harm,

04:21.761 --> 04:24.163
you've got every right
to plant your feet

04:24.198 --> 04:25.898
and shoot to kill.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.500
Some call it a moral right,

04:27.534 --> 04:29.702
and I do include myself
within that class.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.705
All this to say

04:32.739 --> 04:35.509
I'm happy to take your money,

04:35.543 --> 04:38.913
but if you're not
a convicted felon,

04:38.947 --> 04:41.048
you might best be advised

04:41.083 --> 04:43.884
to bear your arms within
the confines of the law.

04:50.425 --> 04:51.959
It's for defense.

04:59.101 --> 05:00.434
Defense.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.001
Thanks, Bonnie.

07:46.639 --> 07:47.872
Jesse.

07:47.907 --> 07:49.441
What's up, brother?

07:51.110 --> 07:53.478
Dude, it sounds
like an earthquake out there.

07:53.512 --> 07:55.480
Yeah. New sound system.

07:55.514 --> 07:56.714
Whoa!
Check it out.

07:56.749 --> 07:59.050
Bodacious subwoofers, yo!

07:59.085 --> 08:00.452
Serious cannons.

08:00.486 --> 08:03.355
18-inchers,
six of them.

08:03.389 --> 08:04.422
Aluminum columns

08:04.457 --> 08:05.590
so they're really, really like,

08:05.625 --> 08:07.025
uh, sonically neutral.

08:07.059 --> 08:08.460
Tweeters are killers, too.

08:08.494 --> 08:10.862
Dig all them lines
jumping around.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.063
Psychedelic.

08:15.001 --> 08:18.703
Kind of like just want
to stare at them.

08:18.738 --> 08:21.139
Hmm. Yeah, man.

08:21.174 --> 08:23.574
Totally makes me want
to crank old Savage

08:23.609 --> 08:25.444
and blaze one.

08:25.478 --> 08:28.146
It's got, like,
parametric equalization.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.847
Automatically
adjusts the levels

08:29.882 --> 08:32.217
to changes in, like,
air pressure and whatnot.

08:32.251 --> 08:35.486
It's a totally digital
vacuum tube amp

08:35.520 --> 08:38.456
which is by far the best
anti-distortion-wise.

08:38.490 --> 08:41.124
It's 120 decibels
without breaking a sweat.

08:42.193 --> 08:44.461
Hold on to your hats, bitches.

09:03.912 --> 09:07.047
Hey, man, I saw Andrea
at a meeting yesterday.

09:07.082 --> 09:08.782
She asked about you.

09:25.501 --> 09:27.669
Thanks, man, but, uh...

09:27.703 --> 09:29.438
12 steps and all that.

09:29.472 --> 09:31.906
Seriously?

09:51.159 --> 09:53.827
Maybe just a little bump.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.003
Left 4 Dead, yo,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.471
the way them bitches
get all cranial

10:06.506 --> 10:08.273
when you cap them in the head.

10:08.307 --> 10:09.274
It's like booyah!

10:09.308 --> 10:10.709
No, no, no, man.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.744
Resident Evil 4
takes it by a long shot.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.579
Aw, please, brother,
you're fronting.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.681
No, man, seriously.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.749
That chick, the one
you got to rescue,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.317
she's smokin', bro,

10:19.352 --> 10:22.921
and then you're, like,
the last undead dude on earth,

10:22.955 --> 10:24.756
so how can you not be
dipping into that?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.625
Talk about inspiring a brother
to kick some zombie ass!

10:27.660 --> 10:29.961
They're trying to eat
your brain, bro.

10:29.995 --> 10:31.729
A dude don't need
no more motivation.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.397
That's a fair point, I guess.

10:33.431 --> 10:36.999
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10:37.034 --> 10:39.936
Call of Duty, World at War--
Zombie mode.

10:39.971 --> 10:41.972
Now, that's the bomb, man.

10:42.006 --> 10:43.140
Think on it, bro.

10:43.174 --> 10:44.742
They're not just zombies.

10:44.776 --> 10:46.477
They're Nazi zombies.

10:46.512 --> 10:47.979
Nazi zombies.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.448
Yeah, man. S.S. Waffen
troopers, too,

10:50.483 --> 10:52.851
which are, like,
the baddest ass Nazis

10:52.885 --> 10:54.486
of the whole Nazi family!

10:54.520 --> 10:55.887
Zombies are dead, man.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.055
What difference does it make

10:57.089 --> 10:58.723
what their job was
when they was living?

10:58.758 --> 11:00.859
Dude, you are so
historically retarded.

11:00.893 --> 11:03.428
Nazi zombies
don't want to eat you

11:03.462 --> 11:05.530
just because they're
craving the protein.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.098
They do it because--

11:07.132 --> 11:11.369
They do it because
they hate Americans, man.

11:11.403 --> 11:14.505
Talibans--
They're the Talibans

11:14.539 --> 11:16.173
of the zombie world.

11:16.207 --> 11:17.307
I played the game, bro.

11:17.341 --> 11:18.641
They ain't exactly
fleet of foot.

11:18.676 --> 11:21.244
Ohh! I'm saying where's
the challenge?

11:21.278 --> 11:23.279
At least the zombies
in Left 4 Dead

11:23.314 --> 11:24.547
clock a respectable 40.

11:24.582 --> 11:25.949
You got to lead them and shit.

11:25.983 --> 11:27.417
Dude, that's because
they're not even zombies!

11:27.451 --> 11:28.718
They're just infected.

11:28.753 --> 11:31.387
They got, like,
this rage virus.

11:31.422 --> 11:33.189
Amps them up like they've
been smoking the schwag!

11:33.224 --> 11:35.158
Apples and oranges, bro.

11:35.192 --> 11:37.560
Totally unfair
to compare the two.

11:40.265 --> 11:42.399
Yo, Jesse,

11:42.433 --> 11:44.401
where do you come out
on all this?

11:44.435 --> 11:47.471
Ha ha! Ohh...

11:47.505 --> 11:49.406
Agree, totally.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.088
Did that just happen?

12:05.691 --> 12:07.625
Damn, man.

12:07.659 --> 12:09.393
It's quiet.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.399
You know what this--
This place needs?

13:48.076 --> 13:49.276
Ohh.

14:25.248 --> 14:26.849
You okay?

14:26.884 --> 14:28.751
Fine.

14:28.786 --> 14:31.620
Can't you sleep?

14:31.655 --> 14:33.856
Actually, yes, Marie.
This is me sleeping.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.758
What's it look like?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.360
Looks like you're
looking at a rock

14:38.395 --> 14:42.331
at...2:24 in the morning.

14:42.365 --> 14:44.434
This is not a rock.
This is a mineral,

14:44.468 --> 14:46.303
for, like, the tenth time.

14:47.639 --> 14:50.174
Okay. Got it.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.910
Blue corundum, to be precise.

14:52.945 --> 14:55.247
Blue corundum.
Well, it's very pretty.

14:55.281 --> 14:57.883
It's encrusted
with igneous biotite

14:57.918 --> 14:59.251
in a mica schist.

14:59.286 --> 15:00.653
Would you like
some more detail?

15:00.687 --> 15:02.455
Because I can give it to you.

15:04.224 --> 15:06.993
You keep acting like you
give the first shit,

15:07.027 --> 15:09.229
and I'll--
Hank.

15:09.263 --> 15:12.399
Found in the Central
Cordillera of Irian Jaya.

15:13.568 --> 15:15.702
Blue corundum.

15:17.005 --> 15:22.710
I'm just saying...
it's 2 in the morning.

15:22.744 --> 15:26.313
I'm just...asking if maybe--

15:26.348 --> 15:27.782
You know, when last
I counted, Marie,

15:27.816 --> 15:30.018
there were four bedrooms
in this house.

15:35.425 --> 15:38.494
You know, I mean, if I'm keeping
you awake and all that.

16:19.337 --> 16:20.871
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

16:20.905 --> 16:22.939
<i>At the tone, please
state your name, number,</i>

16:22.973 --> 16:24.207
<i>and the reason for your call.</i>

16:24.241 --> 16:25.675
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:26.977 --> 16:28.978
<i>Walt?</i>

16:29.012 --> 16:31.780
<i>Hello? Walt?</i>

16:31.815 --> 16:34.182
<i>Um, okay, Walt, could you, uh,</i>

16:34.217 --> 16:35.684
<i>could you call me back, please?</i>

16:35.718 --> 16:39.487
<i>Hank's bills are really
starting to pile up here,</i>

16:39.522 --> 16:41.289
<i>and, uh, in the meantime,</i>

16:41.323 --> 16:43.224
<i>I haven't received a check
from you in quite a while,</i>

16:43.258 --> 16:44.292
<i>so there's that.</i>

16:44.326 --> 16:46.560
<i>Uh, second order of business</i>

16:46.595 --> 16:48.729
<i>is, uh, is the car wash.</i>

16:48.764 --> 16:49.797
Ohh!

16:49.831 --> 16:50.831
God!

16:50.866 --> 16:52.133
<i>Take the next step here.</i>

16:52.167 --> 16:53.901
<i>We need to look
into buying this car wash</i>

16:53.936 --> 16:54.903
<i>while we still have--</i>

16:54.937 --> 16:57.539
Skyler.
What are you doing?

16:57.573 --> 16:58.940
What do you mean?

16:58.975 --> 17:03.012
Wait. Are you screening
all my calls?

17:03.046 --> 17:04.981
No. No. No. I just--

17:05.015 --> 17:07.316
What are you thinking,
leaving a message like that

17:07.351 --> 17:08.550
<i>on my machine?</i>

17:08.586 --> 17:10.319
What are you--
What did I say?

17:10.355 --> 17:13.124
You just left recorded proof

17:13.157 --> 17:15.226
of our intention
to buy a car wash.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.493
Now you think that was wise?

17:16.528 --> 17:19.762
Proof of our what?
What are you talking about?

17:19.798 --> 17:23.733
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"

17:23.768 --> 17:25.602
on the phone at all, period.

17:25.637 --> 17:28.772
Walt, it is a car wash,
not a brothel.

17:28.806 --> 17:31.608
<i>I mean, if we can't
even say what it is,</i>

17:31.642 --> 17:33.076
why are we buying it at all?

17:33.110 --> 17:35.144
<i>God, look, Skyler,
please, just--</i>

17:35.178 --> 17:36.679
Hey, Mom.

17:36.713 --> 17:37.947
Hey, hon.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.383
Look, there's some cereal
on the breakfast table.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.187
I'm telling you,

17:44.221 --> 17:45.288
if you're not willing

17:45.323 --> 17:46.590
to pull the trigger on this,

17:46.624 --> 17:48.892
I am more than happy
to call Goodman myself.

17:48.927 --> 17:52.230
No, no, no, no, no.
I will handle it, okay?

18:58.795 --> 19:01.296
I could so use a brain
transplant right now.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.665
Hey, uh, I'm going to work.

19:05.768 --> 19:07.035
Wake up, bitch.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.203
Aah!

19:09.672 --> 19:11.406
Damn!

19:11.440 --> 19:12.607
Ohh.

19:12.641 --> 19:17.178
You're way too sensitive
about your zone, bro.

19:17.212 --> 19:20.815
Ohh. Come on, man.
Clean-up time.

19:20.850 --> 19:23.484
Right on. Least we can do.

19:23.519 --> 19:27.721
Hey. The hell with,
uh, with cleaning up.

19:27.756 --> 19:31.825
Just go out and get
everybody some breakfast.

19:31.859 --> 19:33.693
Stock up on liquor
while you're at it.

19:33.728 --> 19:35.695
Keep this party going.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.831
I mean it, yo.

19:37.865 --> 19:39.699
<i>I want this place kicking
harder than a Sensei</i>

19:39.734 --> 19:41.534
when I get back.

19:41.569 --> 19:42.802
All right.

19:42.837 --> 19:44.438
You got it, bro.

19:53.782 --> 19:55.683
Come on, damn it.

19:55.718 --> 19:57.752
Wake up and party!

21:29.945 --> 21:31.479
Hmm.

21:31.514 --> 21:32.780
Hello.

21:34.183 --> 21:35.651
Yo, you the new guy?

21:35.685 --> 21:36.952
Yeah.

21:36.986 --> 21:38.754
You got something for me?

21:38.788 --> 21:42.458
201.6.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.964
What's the count?

21:48.998 --> 21:51.199
201.6.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.436
Give it a second weigh
if you would, please.

21:54.470 --> 21:56.237
New policy.

21:59.708 --> 22:01.476
What, Walter?

22:03.379 --> 22:04.379
Where's Gus?

22:04.413 --> 22:05.714
Why?

22:05.748 --> 22:09.051
Because I would like
to speak with him.

22:12.055 --> 22:15.325
Because,
the way we left things,

22:15.359 --> 22:18.528
I-- I would like
the chance to clear the air.

22:18.563 --> 22:20.664
Hmm.

22:20.698 --> 22:22.733
What?

22:23.935 --> 22:26.437
Walter, you're never
going to see him again.

22:38.867 --> 22:41.635
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

22:41.670 --> 22:42.936
Are you hungry?

22:42.971 --> 22:45.306
Yeah, that's good.
Drink that up.

22:45.340 --> 22:48.276
Just a little longer,
okay, my sweetie?

22:48.310 --> 22:49.477
Okay?

22:53.517 --> 22:55.084
There you go.

22:55.118 --> 22:57.721
Okay, now...

22:57.755 --> 23:03.160
the Dodge gets a detail,

23:03.194 --> 23:05.229
and...

23:05.263 --> 23:10.701
the Corolla gets a hand wax?

23:10.735 --> 23:13.036
Right? Hand wax.

23:13.070 --> 23:14.371
Okay.

23:14.405 --> 23:17.140
Oh. Hello. Hello.

23:17.174 --> 23:19.708
Just a few more minutes,
and we're on our way home.

23:19.743 --> 23:21.577
Okay, my sweet girl?

23:21.611 --> 23:24.713
Mama's just
doing her work here.

23:24.748 --> 23:27.550
Mama's doing her work.

23:27.584 --> 23:28.718
Let's see.

23:32.756 --> 23:35.025
Way to go, Hank.

23:35.059 --> 23:36.927
Whoa, way to soldier up.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.197
You're doing it!

23:41.232 --> 23:42.733
Come on!

23:43.769 --> 23:45.202
Another few yards.

23:45.236 --> 23:47.071
Damn!

23:49.107 --> 23:50.908
Ahh, Jesus!

23:52.110 --> 23:54.679
Look at you!
Way to go, honey!

23:54.713 --> 23:56.146
Come on.

23:56.180 --> 23:57.848
Come on, Hank!

23:57.883 --> 23:59.683
Keep it going!

24:01.887 --> 24:02.853
Uhh!

24:02.888 --> 24:04.788
Just ten more steps.

24:04.823 --> 24:06.157
9!

24:07.392 --> 24:08.426
8.

24:09.078 --> 24:09.878
7!

24:11.562 --> 24:12.139
6!

24:15.202 --> 24:17.137
You're almost there, Hank.

24:17.171 --> 24:19.105
Uhh!

24:19.140 --> 24:21.742
God!
Ha ha ha ha!

24:21.776 --> 24:24.377
Oh, yeah.
All right, buddy.

24:24.412 --> 24:26.513
That's what I call
kicking some ass.

24:26.547 --> 24:28.481
Oh, it was awesome, babe!

24:28.516 --> 24:29.683
Ohh.

24:29.717 --> 24:31.051
Hell, yeah.

24:31.085 --> 24:32.052
Very nice.

24:32.086 --> 24:33.086
Yeah!

24:33.120 --> 24:35.021
Hey!

24:39.327 --> 24:41.362
You're a good man, Chuck.
Thanks.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.697
It's an honor, my friend.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.032
Same time tomorrow?

24:45.066 --> 24:47.902
Damn straight,
if I'm still alive.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.539
Great session.
Lots of positive energy.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.807
Lots.

24:55.176 --> 24:57.844
It's just it's so great
to see that.

24:57.879 --> 25:01.514
It's just-- Yeah.

25:03.150 --> 25:04.351
One day at a time.

25:04.385 --> 25:06.086
All we can do.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.355
I know. It's just

25:08.389 --> 25:10.357
you've got a real way with him.

25:10.391 --> 25:11.758
It's--

25:13.862 --> 25:15.396
You want to go full-time?

25:15.430 --> 25:17.031
We've got a spare bedroom.

25:17.065 --> 25:18.866
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.642
Wow.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.411
You were so strong today.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.679
Did you work up an appetite?

25:31.714 --> 25:33.247
I'm sure that you did.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.883
Listen, I was thinking
about cooking tonight.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.418
So--
Marie.

25:39.354 --> 25:40.554
Get out.

26:03.381 --> 26:05.282
Oh, yo, about time.

26:05.316 --> 26:06.650
Oh, my God.

26:08.754 --> 26:11.289
Yo, what's up with the pie,
man? It ain't cut.

26:11.323 --> 26:14.159
Yeah. Right.
That's the gimmick.

26:14.193 --> 26:15.560
What gimmick?
This place.

26:15.594 --> 26:16.727
They don't cut their pizza,

26:16.762 --> 26:18.662
and they pass the savings
on to you.

26:18.697 --> 26:20.965
What savings?
How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?

26:20.999 --> 26:23.533
Maybe it's, like,
democratic, bro, you know?

26:23.568 --> 26:26.637
Cut your own Christmas tree.
Cut your own pizza.

26:26.671 --> 26:28.305
Yeah. It's democratic.

26:28.339 --> 26:30.407
What am I supposed
to do with this?

26:30.442 --> 26:31.675
Don't sweat it, yo.

26:31.709 --> 26:34.145
You got some, like, scissors?

26:34.179 --> 26:36.114
I will cut this bitch up good.

26:37.317 --> 26:39.485
Yo, come in!

26:39.519 --> 26:41.354
Hey, would you mind?

26:41.388 --> 26:45.924
I figure you make, like,
10 million pizzas a year.

26:45.959 --> 26:49.694
Each pizza takes,
like, 10 seconds to cut.

26:49.728 --> 26:52.197
In man hours, that's--

26:52.231 --> 26:54.532
I don't know.

26:55.601 --> 26:56.601
A lot?

26:56.636 --> 26:57.669
Hey, Jesse.

26:57.703 --> 26:58.703
Huh.

26:58.737 --> 27:02.007
You got, um, yeah.

27:28.501 --> 27:30.435
So, uh, how you doing?

27:32.071 --> 27:33.406
I'm dealing.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.609
How's Brock?

27:39.031 --> 27:40.333
Good. He's...

27:42.883 --> 27:45.551
Brock, honey,
wait in the car, okay?

27:45.585 --> 27:46.952
Let the grownups speak.

27:46.987 --> 27:49.321
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.

27:55.528 --> 27:57.195
Guess you know
I've been calling.

27:58.998 --> 28:02.901
Yeah, um, I'm really
busy at work and--

28:02.935 --> 28:07.606
Jesse, I'm not here to make
you come up with excuses.

28:07.641 --> 28:09.809
You got other things going on.

28:09.843 --> 28:11.778
I get it.

28:11.812 --> 28:14.515
There's just one thing
you and me got to talk about.

28:15.984 --> 28:17.852
And that's this.

28:19.655 --> 28:20.755
After Tomás was murdered,

28:20.789 --> 28:21.890
two dudes from the block,

28:21.924 --> 28:23.558
a couple bangers
he used to hang with,

28:23.592 --> 28:25.727
get run over,
one of them shot in the head.

28:25.761 --> 28:29.931
Same night,
I get this in my mailbox.

28:36.305 --> 28:37.639
This was you?

28:48.953 --> 28:50.387
You know what?

28:50.421 --> 28:52.990
Whatever it is you had to do
with my brother's killers,

28:53.024 --> 28:54.325
I don't want to know.

28:55.727 --> 28:57.762
But you got to tell me
one thing.

28:57.796 --> 29:00.365
Is someone gonna come
looking for this?

29:03.569 --> 29:04.635
No.

29:10.575 --> 29:13.943
What exactly am I
supposed to do with this?

29:13.978 --> 29:15.879
Use it to get you and Brock

29:15.913 --> 29:19.082
out of that shit hole
of a neighborhood.

29:19.116 --> 29:22.285
Or you can go out
and spend it on glass,

29:22.319 --> 29:24.087
and I'd have no way
of stopping you.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.059
But I got to believe
you won't do that.

32:15.161 --> 32:16.562
<i>Go home, Walter.</i>

32:40.725 --> 32:41.926
How you doing?

32:43.262 --> 32:45.062
Hi.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.564
Ton of bricks?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.167
Rocks.

32:52.205 --> 32:54.105
You, uh, want me
to wheel them inside for you?

32:54.140 --> 32:55.340
Thank you.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.383
Marie, is that my minerals?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.984
Yes, Hank.

33:07.018 --> 33:08.152
How many boxes?

33:08.186 --> 33:09.453
I don't know--

33:09.488 --> 33:12.389
Three, four, a hundred,

33:12.424 --> 33:14.458
a million.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.726
I don't know.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.361
Did you check them for damage?

33:17.395 --> 33:18.962
Oh, my God.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.132
They're rocks, Hank.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.233
No, they're minerals.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.868
Jesus, Marie, I got
some geodes coming

33:24.903 --> 33:27.237
that are very delicate,
all right?

33:27.272 --> 33:29.840
And I will not accept
any boxes that have damage.

33:29.874 --> 33:31.541
Those delivery jackoffs,
I'm telling you--

33:31.576 --> 33:33.844
I'm not getting ass raped
by those bastards, all right?

33:33.878 --> 33:34.878
Just--

33:37.215 --> 33:38.848
Honey, would you check?

33:40.016 --> 33:41.784
Just check, please?

33:53.497 --> 33:56.031
Hey, you, too much wax.

33:56.066 --> 33:57.666
Stop wasting it.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.635
Look, tell your brother

33:59.669 --> 34:01.370
that if he doesn't
show up tomorrow,

34:01.404 --> 34:02.671
I'm going to have to fire him.

34:02.706 --> 34:06.442
So now go back.
And no more excuses.

34:06.476 --> 34:10.078
Mr. Wolynetz,
my name is Skyler White.

34:10.112 --> 34:11.478
How do you do?

34:18.054 --> 34:20.554
You want to buy my car wash.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.958
I do. And I am prepared
to talk numbers right now,

34:23.993 --> 34:25.193
if you'd like.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.895
Do you think
this is an easy job?

34:27.929 --> 34:31.833
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees

34:31.867 --> 34:34.603
and scrub like a house maid

34:34.637 --> 34:38.507
with all the chemicals
eating into your nice skin

34:38.542 --> 34:39.909
and stinging in your eyes?

34:39.943 --> 34:43.714
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.315
Any other advice for me?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.184
Because
I am serious about this.

34:47.217 --> 34:48.553
Good.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.022
I am serious, too.

34:51.056 --> 34:53.389
I have worked 30 years

34:53.425 --> 34:55.326
of building this business
from nothing,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.027
with my own hands

34:57.062 --> 34:58.728
and my own sweat and blood.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.898
I can appreciate that, truly.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.299
So, with that in mind,

35:03.333 --> 35:06.068
is there a figure
you can quote me?

35:06.102 --> 35:07.970
One which you think
would adequately--

35:08.004 --> 35:09.538
$10 million.

35:17.314 --> 35:21.217
Well, let's try 879,000.

35:21.251 --> 35:22.885
Where do you come up
with this number?

35:22.919 --> 35:24.620
You pull it from your behind?

35:28.959 --> 35:30.693
On a typical day,

35:30.727 --> 35:33.328
you manage 19 cars per hour.

35:33.362 --> 35:35.930
Extrapolating,
I added the extra revenues

35:35.965 --> 35:37.565
for hand waxes and detailing,

35:37.599 --> 35:40.367
subtracted your overhead
and salary and maintenance,

35:40.402 --> 35:42.536
operating fees, depreciation,

35:42.570 --> 35:44.705
which I obtained
from comparable businesses

35:44.739 --> 35:46.006
in the Albuquerque area,

35:46.040 --> 35:49.543
giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here,

35:49.577 --> 35:52.913
to which I applied the
industry standard multiplier

35:52.948 --> 35:54.982
and added the market value
of your real estate,

35:55.017 --> 35:59.721
giving me a total estimated
value of $829,000,

35:59.755 --> 36:04.993
on top of which I generously
added an extra $50,000...

36:06.062 --> 36:08.564
so as not to be insulting.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.634
$20 million.

36:13.203 --> 36:15.305
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz,
this--

36:15.340 --> 36:17.907
This is the price
for Walter White.

36:19.276 --> 36:20.944
Ah.
Oh, yes.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.946
You don't think
I know who you are?

36:22.980 --> 36:24.447
I remember.

36:24.482 --> 36:27.417
Well, I have not
pretended to be any--

36:27.451 --> 36:30.753
Your husband, he quit
without giving me notice.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.855
He broke my air fresheners.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.692
He cursed at me
and grabbed himself.

36:35.726 --> 36:38.094
And now he wants to buy
my car wash.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.562
But he's not man enough

36:39.597 --> 36:41.664
to come in here
and face me himself.

36:41.698 --> 36:43.299
Instead, he sends his woman.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.600
Excuse me?

36:44.635 --> 36:46.702
Walter White wants
to buy my car wash.

36:46.736 --> 36:50.939
The price he pays
is $20 million.

36:50.973 --> 36:52.274
Now please leave.

37:06.455 --> 37:08.489
<i>Have you recently
lost a loved one</i>

37:08.523 --> 37:11.258
<i>on an aviation disaster?</i>

37:11.293 --> 37:13.428
<i>Have you suffered injury,</i>

37:13.462 --> 37:15.029
<i>shock to the senses,</i>

37:15.064 --> 37:16.331
<i>or property damage</i>

37:16.366 --> 37:18.334
<i>as a result of airplane debris</i>

37:18.368 --> 37:20.803
<i>or, God forbid,
falling body parts?</i>

37:20.838 --> 37:23.040
<i>Then call me, Saul Goodman.</i>

37:24.075 --> 37:25.275
<i>It goes without saying</i>

37:25.310 --> 37:26.577
<i>that the six-, seven-,</i>

37:26.611 --> 37:28.312
<i>perhaps even eight-figure
cash settlement</i>

37:28.347 --> 37:29.547
<i>that I can win for you</i>

37:29.581 --> 37:31.949
<i>will never fill the hole
in your heart</i>

37:31.983 --> 37:33.717
<i>caused by your tragic loss,</i>

37:33.752 --> 37:36.420
<i>but you deserve justice.</i>

37:36.455 --> 37:38.156
<i>So if you want
to tip the scales</i>

37:38.190 --> 37:39.524
<i>back in your favor,</i>

37:39.559 --> 37:41.093
<i>better call Saul.</i>

37:41.127 --> 37:42.528
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law.</i>

37:42.563 --> 37:45.164
<i>(505)503-4455.
Hmm.</i>

37:45.198 --> 37:48.234
<i>Se habla español.</i>

38:10.860 --> 38:13.361
You might want to learn
how to tail better

38:13.395 --> 38:15.963
if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

38:18.766 --> 38:20.601
May I buy you a drink?

38:22.837 --> 38:24.471
Next round, when you're done.

38:26.374 --> 38:29.609
Why not? You make a hell
of a lot more than I do.

38:35.450 --> 38:37.551
Uh, another round for him,

38:37.585 --> 38:40.054
and I'll have the same.
No ice.

38:47.562 --> 38:53.099
I feel like I need
to explain myself.

38:53.134 --> 38:55.101
There were some actions
that I took

38:55.136 --> 38:57.103
which I want you to understand.

38:58.806 --> 39:02.275
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

39:04.445 --> 39:05.879
Everything I did

39:05.913 --> 39:08.948
I did out of loyalty
to my partner,

39:08.983 --> 39:13.386
and then, later, of course,

39:13.421 --> 39:16.122
it was purely
out of self-defense.

39:16.156 --> 39:19.058
I hope you can
appreciate that...

39:19.093 --> 39:22.529
just like I appreciated
that, uh--

39:26.634 --> 39:30.538
I appreciate that when
you were going to kill me

39:30.572 --> 39:32.740
you were simply
following orders.

39:32.774 --> 39:34.742
I get that completely.

39:35.744 --> 39:37.312
And I harbor no ill will.

39:37.346 --> 39:41.249
Well, there's a load
off my mind.

39:42.585 --> 39:44.185
Mike,
I'm trying to tell you--

39:44.220 --> 39:45.553
I get it.

39:45.588 --> 39:47.189
Fine.

39:47.223 --> 39:49.157
Drink up, Walter.

40:02.838 --> 40:05.173
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

40:08.043 --> 40:11.045
Makes a man wonder
exactly where he stands.

40:15.450 --> 40:16.551
Huh.

40:19.788 --> 40:21.155
I mean, I--

40:21.189 --> 40:24.992
I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

40:26.194 --> 40:28.162
Not after what happened
to Victor.

40:30.999 --> 40:32.933
So...

40:34.436 --> 40:36.804
what's with the piece?

40:36.838 --> 40:39.906
Right hip
inside your waistband.

40:39.941 --> 40:42.676
I noticed it the other
day at the lab.

40:42.710 --> 40:45.213
You wear it if it
makes you feel better,

40:45.247 --> 40:47.615
but if push comes to shove,
it's not going to help.

40:47.649 --> 40:51.219
Mike, do I have to come
right out and say this?

40:52.855 --> 40:56.558
You and I,
we're in the same boat.

40:56.592 --> 40:57.993
Drink your drink.

40:58.027 --> 41:01.229
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

41:01.263 --> 41:03.431
And-- And what the hell
was that anyway?

41:03.466 --> 41:05.901
Hmm? A message?

41:05.935 --> 41:09.871
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

41:09.906 --> 41:11.339
You won, Walter.

41:11.374 --> 41:13.609
You got the job.

41:15.145 --> 41:16.378
Do yourself a favor

41:16.412 --> 41:19.181
and learn to take yes
for an answer.

41:19.215 --> 41:23.385
Yeah, I got the job,
but for how long?

41:26.823 --> 41:31.694
Get me in a room with him.

41:31.728 --> 41:36.065
Mike, just get me in a room,

41:36.099 --> 41:38.634
and I'll do the rest.

41:45.342 --> 41:46.842
You done?

41:51.515 --> 41:53.249
Yeah.

41:58.822 --> 42:00.023
Ohh!

42:03.159 --> 42:04.259
Oof!

42:04.294 --> 42:05.361
Ohh!

42:27.618 --> 42:29.251
Thanks for the drink.

42:32.222 --> 42:33.322
Ahh.

42:43.867 --> 42:46.703
Hey, my man, you know
how to party, brother.

42:46.737 --> 42:49.339
Epic! Epic!

42:49.373 --> 42:52.142
Uh, seriously, where
are you two going?

42:52.176 --> 42:56.480
Jesse, I've been awake for,
like, three straight days.

42:56.514 --> 42:58.549
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

42:58.583 --> 43:02.252
So crash here. It's not
like I ain't got the space.

43:02.287 --> 43:03.721
Yeah, that's cool and all,

43:03.755 --> 43:06.323
but I think I got,
like, this cat.

43:06.358 --> 43:10.494
I think I'm, like,
supposed to feed it.

43:10.528 --> 43:11.728
Whatever, you little bitch.

43:11.763 --> 43:13.964
What about you?
You sticking,

43:13.998 --> 43:15.632
or do I got to flip you over

43:15.667 --> 43:17.301
and check you for a slizz?

43:17.335 --> 43:19.536
Bro, I'm kind of
pushing flowers here, yo.

43:19.570 --> 43:22.505
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

43:22.540 --> 43:26.343
Hell, brother, you know
we got man love for you.

43:26.378 --> 43:27.811
Now that you're
back in the mix,

43:27.846 --> 43:30.848
it's like nothing
but good days ahead.

43:33.051 --> 43:35.653
Plenty of time to pace it
out is all I'm saying.

43:35.687 --> 43:36.754
Yeah.

43:36.788 --> 43:38.189
Yeah, man.

43:39.392 --> 43:40.458
Totally.

43:43.096 --> 43:45.831
I was thinking,
like, next week?

43:45.865 --> 43:48.668
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

43:48.702 --> 43:50.737
Are we cool?

43:50.771 --> 43:52.572
We are cool.
