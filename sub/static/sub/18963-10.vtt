00:36.637 --> 00:38.239
♫ So they all went away ♫

00:38.306 --> 00:39.640
♫ Singing oh,
by gee, by gosh ♫

00:39.707 --> 00:42.110
♫ By gum, by Jove,
By Jingo ♫

00:42.176 --> 00:44.745
♫ By gee, you're
the only girl for me ♫

00:44.812 --> 00:46.314
♫ ...for me ♫

00:46.380 --> 00:48.382
♫ By Jingo had a lover ♫

00:48.449 --> 00:50.584
♫ He was always under covers ♫

00:50.651 --> 00:52.786
♫ La da la Ba da Ba dum... ♫

00:52.853 --> 00:54.855
It's "under cover."

00:54.922 --> 00:55.989
What?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.176
"He was always under cover,"

00:57.225 --> 00:58.826
not "under covers."

00:58.892 --> 01:02.263
She had a lover, and he
was always under covers.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.497
That makes sense.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.233
Right. Well,
I guess you'd know more

01:05.299 --> 01:07.435
about that sort of thing
than I would.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.272
It's just a song, Zelda.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.143
Here, darling.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.778
Why don't you see
if you can find a road

01:17.845 --> 01:19.012
that'll take us to Richmond?

01:19.147 --> 01:23.551
Uh, it says "Jog left
at Vagabond Lane."

01:23.617 --> 01:25.453
What do you think
they mean by jog?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.389
Well, I think that means
to step on the gas

01:28.456 --> 01:31.192
- and then scoot around...
- Slow down, Scott.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.994
I want to get to Montgomery
in one piece.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.563
All right, then.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.764
No jog.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.168
How long are we going
to be in Montgomery for?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.470
I don't know.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.905
Well, it's just that I
promised Max Perkins...

01:44.972 --> 01:47.175
You didn't have to come.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.920
I've been thinking.

01:59.987 --> 02:00.987
Oh?

02:01.021 --> 02:02.256
Maybe I'll go on the wagon

02:02.323 --> 02:03.957
for a little while.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.193
Clear my head.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.760
Really?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.662
You don't think I can?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.702
Hand me that gin bottle
in the back there.

02:20.308 --> 02:24.212
All right, then, uh,
I guess I will, too.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.415
It wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world

02:27.481 --> 02:30.218
for Mama and Daddy to see us
off the bottle for once.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.420
I didn't do it for your father.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.789
The judge has rendered
his verdict.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.791
There will be no retrial.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.861
Can you blame him?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.633
Can't say that I do.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.901
Thank you.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.481
Congratulations!

03:34.648 --> 03:37.518
So now Sarah Bernhardt's
writing novels.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.920
The actress?
She's still alive?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.855
She's 75 years old.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.123
Huh.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.568
"The famous actress
has already dabbled

03:44.592 --> 03:46.193
"in painting and sculpture.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.729
"This is her first
excursion to literature.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.932
"She has said and declared
that if it is successful,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.701
she'll attempt a play."

03:54.802 --> 03:55.869
Well, good for her.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.605
Huh.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.172
What?

03:59.307 --> 04:02.310
Uch. For God's sake,
she's an actress.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.545
At 75 years old,

04:04.612 --> 04:06.580
maybe she doesn't care
as much as you do.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.448
Maybe not.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.383
Maybe that's your problem.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.918
What, that I care?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.185
No. That I don't.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.021
And I'm sick
of talking about it.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
Right or left?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.568
I must have taken a wrong turn.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.235
I told you we should
have turned back

05:02.370 --> 05:03.437
at that service station.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.606
That's not
what Dr. Jones advised.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.711
Well, there's a cabin up there.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.414
Maybe they can tell us how
to get to Fredericksburg.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.816
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.386
Sure it is.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.394
Maybe we should wait
until we get to a real town.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.028
We haven't seen a real
town in miles.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.798
Now come on. There are
dogs out front.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.399
Oh!

05:32.400 --> 05:34.602
Holy Jesus!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.904
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.105
Stop the car.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.981
It's gone. The whole thing
is absolutely gone.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.686
I can see that.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.456
I guess the expensive
doesn't like Virginia.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.091
Why are you laughing?
This is a problem.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.993
You'll have to fix that wheel.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.529
We're gonna have to
find it first.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.497
Them potholes are
real bad on tires.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.666
That's for sure.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.901
Mister,

06:07.968 --> 06:09.269
is this what you're looking for?

06:09.336 --> 06:11.439
Need a hand?

06:11.472 --> 06:15.509
Uh, no. No, it's fine.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.995
Where are you going?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.964
Home.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.832
Where is that?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.267
Alabama.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.470
Is it far?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.706
90 miles from here.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.576
Is it nice?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.012
It's the most beautiful
place on Earth.

06:53.881 --> 06:57.017
The air smells
like, uh, ripe pears.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.720
The nights are warm and soft.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.090
And it's old
and comfortable now.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.595
Everything's old here, too.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.196
I don't like it much.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.668
I'm going to get
to Richmond some day.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
Don't be in too big a hurry.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.176
The world's a big place.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.178
This will help you find it.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.519
Thank you, lady.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.988
How are we doing, fellas?

07:35.055 --> 07:38.859
We're all done.
Thanks for your help.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.961
So which way to Fredericksburg?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.930
About 15 miles on that road.

07:42.996 --> 07:43.997
Can't miss it.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.098
Great.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.803
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.972
You're, uh,

07:52.039 --> 07:54.274
you're gonna let her drive?

07:54.341 --> 07:57.344
Of course. She's my queen.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.546
Hmm.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.895
Well, we're going to have
to be careful now.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.464
You just gave that man
our last $5.00.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.333
We only have about
enough for one more
night on the road.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.837
What? You didn't tell me
we were running out of money.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.640
I wouldn't have bought such
a big breakfast this morning.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.910
I wanted you to have
whatever breakfast
you wanted, darling.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.144
I don't want you to worry.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.212
You still could have
been honest with me

08:33.280 --> 08:34.582
about the money.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.589
That's all right. We'll
be in Montgomery soon.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.190
We can stay in Mama's house.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.992
That house is so big.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.595
Huh. You can even
finish your novel there.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.196
Right.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.805
Whoa. What are you doing?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.042
Wait!
What are you doing?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.511
- Saving money.
- No, no, no, no!

09:07.781 --> 09:10.150
Christ Almighty, Zelda.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.252
You can't break the law!

09:14.154 --> 09:15.055
Whoo hoo hoo!

09:15.122 --> 09:17.791
We don't want the cops after us.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.360
I didn't know I married
a regular land stirrer.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.529
There's a lot
you don't know
about me.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.798
Oh!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.802
What was that?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.745
Uh...

09:44.417 --> 09:46.119
Still alive.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.339
I didn't see it.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.316
What are we going to do?

10:18.518 --> 10:19.787
We can't do anything.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.855
There must be something.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.692
There's nothing.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.227
Get in the car.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.999
Oh.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.935
Zelda, we got to go.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.403
It's just a matter of time

10:36.469 --> 10:38.371
before the toll booth guy
comes looking for us.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.542
We can't just
leave him here, Scott.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.244
What do you want me to do?

10:46.346 --> 10:47.848
I'm not God.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.224
Zelda, let's go.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.070
How could you leave that
animal to suffer like that?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.472
You're the one
that hit it, Zelda.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.940
He came out of nowhere.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.608
No one could have stopped.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.878
I never should have
let you drive.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.780
Let me drive?

11:52.813 --> 11:55.115
You insisted.
I indulged.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.549
Indulged me.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.218
What am I, a child?

11:58.285 --> 12:01.354
Why do you get to decide
what I do and don't do?

12:01.421 --> 12:03.824
We're just talking
about a dying animal

12:03.891 --> 12:05.325
that we couldn't help,
that is all.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.427
Yes, it was distressing,
but we have to move on.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.863
I didn't want to move on.
That deer was suffering.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.300
Look, you didn't know
what you wanted.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.467
You were hysterical.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.603
Now, I had to do what I
thought was right.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.229
I had to make a decision
for both of us.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.940
What you thought was right?

12:20.007 --> 12:22.275
Like letting Eugenia Bankhead
give you the works?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.343
Was that right?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.379
What?

12:27.714 --> 12:28.949
Ah...

12:31.618 --> 12:32.853
I was drunk.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.088
You're always drunk.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.224
Well, I saw you with Townsend.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.260
We were just talking.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.295
You were in each other's arms.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.264
He's been after you
ever since he met you.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.465
You know that.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.200
But we were just talking.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.402
- It didn't mean anything.
- Exactly.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.338
None of it means anything.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.109
Is that the kind of marriage
you want to have?

12:59.646 --> 13:01.048
No.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.051
No, of course not.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.756
I just...

13:09.857 --> 13:11.859
I got drunk.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.995
And I lost myself.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.869
I wish we hadn't
thrown out that gin.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.331
Yeah?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.468
Good evening.
We'd like a room.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.640
Where are you folks from?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.576
New York City.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.346
New York City.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.082
We're on our way to Montgomery.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.485
Oh, I like your bulldog, Mister.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.287
We're sold out tonight.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.353
Sold out?

15:22.990 --> 15:26.326
But there's clearly no one here.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.195
No vacancy.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.497
There aren't any motorcars

15:30.563 --> 15:31.563
parked outside.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.071
We got a dress code here,
and she's breaking it.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.175
Ah.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.344
He doesn't like
my knickerbockers.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.081
Pity a nice girl like you

15:48.148 --> 15:50.517
should be let to wear
them kind of clothes.

15:50.583 --> 15:54.054
And exactly
what kind of clothing

15:54.121 --> 15:55.822
should a nice girl be wearing,

15:55.888 --> 15:58.058
in your opinion, Floyd,

15:58.125 --> 16:00.427
seeing as you're clearly a man

16:00.493 --> 16:02.162
of sartorial flair?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.189
Don't know what you're
trying to say, fancy pants.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.666
What clothing should
my wife be wearing?

16:06.733 --> 16:07.867
Scott, let's just go.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.369
No. I am tired and hungry,

16:09.436 --> 16:10.870
you would like to take a bath,

16:10.937 --> 16:12.439
and we would like to get a room.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.341
Not my problem.
I ain't renting a room

16:14.407 --> 16:16.776
to some Yankee bed bunny.
Now, I...

16:16.843 --> 16:18.145
You calling my wife a...

16:18.211 --> 16:19.746
- Take your hands off...
- Hey, Mister,

16:19.812 --> 16:22.249
you don't want me wearing
these pants in your hotel?

16:22.315 --> 16:25.752
How about now? You going
to rent us a room now?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.724
I'm calling the sheriff.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.693
We'd better scram.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.397
Go on.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.705
Did you see his face?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.575
I was too busy looking
at your legs, darling.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.511
Hurry up.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.679
Uhh.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.913
Ah.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.882
- What's wrong?
- Slide over.

16:55.948 --> 16:56.948
It's dead again.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.151
Damn.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
Release the brake.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.456
Who bought this rolling
piece of junk anyway?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.656
We did!

17:06.826 --> 17:08.661
Hold on!

17:08.728 --> 17:10.196
Come on, come on.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.176
I don't miss New York at all.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.712
Not even the people?

17:59.779 --> 18:02.815
Especially not the people.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.523
I love you, darling.

18:13.393 --> 18:17.830
We can't ever let anything
or anyone come between us.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.170
Sometimes we come between us.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.425
Mama. Daddy?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.298
Hello!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.472
Katie?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.241
It's all locked up.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.212
They're not home.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.748
Well, did they tell you
where they were heading?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.750
They left rather abruptly,
remember?

20:17.817 --> 20:21.488
I assumed they were going
to take the train back home,

20:21.554 --> 20:24.857
but I guess they went
back to Tilde's.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.428
Scott, what am I going to do?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.231
What do you mean?

20:32.299 --> 20:34.133
I need to see them.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.835
Darling, they...

20:35.902 --> 20:37.537
they're not gone forever.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.239
You don't understand.
I need to see them now.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.318
Everything's come undone.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.787
Nothing's come undone.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.955
We're fine.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.457
We're not fine.

20:57.524 --> 21:01.961
We have no money, no car,
no place to stay,

21:02.028 --> 21:03.696
no place for you to write.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.499
Where are we supposed to go?
We don't have a home!

21:06.566 --> 21:08.635
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.340
We can go anywhere
and do anything we want.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.875
If you want to go to Paris,
we'll go to Paris.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.378
If you want to go to Cairo
and ride a camel,

21:18.445 --> 21:21.013
I'll be right there with you.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.517
The world is ours,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.420
and I want to see every
bit of it with you...

21:29.221 --> 21:31.157
as long as we're together,

21:31.223 --> 21:33.860
because no matter where we are,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.462
we're home.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.745
Oh, and I want to be
with you anywhere.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.048
Me, too.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.652
I can write anywhere.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.728
I love you best of all.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.976
I really need a bath and a nap.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.817
Ah, well...

22:31.984 --> 22:33.420
we could break a window.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.923
Oh, if you think
my daddy hates you now...

22:40.026 --> 22:42.194
I know where we can go.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.530
Come on.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.555
They have guest rooms
upstairs for members.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.222
It won't be the Biltmore, but...

23:10.289 --> 23:11.958
- Zelda.
- Zelda Sayre.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.359
Ohh!

23:13.460 --> 23:15.462
John. Ellie.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.896
How are you?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.030
Good.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.466
Oh, Zelda.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.467
When did you get back?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.369
Look at your hair.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.472
Heavens, Zelda,
what are you doing here?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.540
I thought your parents
went up to see you.

23:27.607 --> 23:32.311
They did, but, uh...
oh, it's a long story.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.080
I read your book.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.347
We all have.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.083
It caused quite
a stir around here.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.184
And everywhere.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.953
Oh, good.
That was my intention.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.923
I should, uh, go see
about the room, darling.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.326
Zelda, you're famous.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.494
We've been following you

23:48.495 --> 23:49.529
in all the papers.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.230
And you're married.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.899
Yes, I am.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.100
What's it like?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.503
There's a lot
of drinking involved.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.505
But not now.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.706
We're off it now.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.542
Oh, come on, Zelda, for real.

24:05.144 --> 24:09.515
It feels like I haven't
been back here in ages.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.851
Tell me about you.
And Montgomery.

24:11.918 --> 24:12.785
And Livye.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.921
Oh, Livye's dating
Stuart Ramsey.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.223
Oh, no one knows why.
He's a mailman.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.291
He's nice to her.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.993
Oh, but listen to this.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.929
Buddy Hollingsworth
and Nita McCormick

24:22.995 --> 24:24.673
were caught kissing
at a picture show last...

24:24.697 --> 24:26.074
Zelda, narrating:
It's a funny thing

24:26.098 --> 24:27.399
coming home.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.602
Nothing changes.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.538
Everything looks the same,

24:31.571 --> 24:33.640
feels the same,

24:33.706 --> 24:36.709
even smells the same.

24:36.776 --> 24:40.246
You realize what's changed...

24:40.312 --> 24:42.381
is you.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.350
Zelda, are you
back for the ball?

24:44.416 --> 24:46.285
Oh, uh, I don't know.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.621
We just needed a place to stay.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.791
Actually, uh,
I need to freshen up.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.560
Can you tell Scott
I'll be right back?

24:53.593 --> 24:54.761
Sure, sure.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.131
Excuse me.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.098
Are you sick, honey?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.435
I'm pregnant.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.038
Oh. My goodness.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.140
Well, congratulations.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.944
I had the same thing
with all of my babies.

25:45.011 --> 25:48.114
Ginger tea, plain crackers.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.616
Works every time.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.786
Your mother must be so thrilled.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.817
Nobody has ever measured...

26:27.453 --> 26:29.188
not even poets...

26:30.957 --> 26:33.325
how much the heart can hold.
