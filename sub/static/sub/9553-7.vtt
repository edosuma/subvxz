01:31.510 --> 01:32.510
Ow!

01:32.510 --> 01:35.010
Ow, oh, I got a cramp!

01:35.010 --> 01:36.510
What are you
doing, Ralph?

01:36.510 --> 01:38.010
Oh, my leg, my leg's in a knot!

01:38.010 --> 01:39.520
Will you get
your leg down, Ralph?

01:39.520 --> 01:41.520
Oh, rub it, Rich, will you?

01:41.520 --> 01:44.020
I'm not gonna rub your
leg, it's ridiculous.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.140
Wait till you get a cramp.

01:45.140 --> 01:47.220
I can't handle this
necking in a car.

01:47.220 --> 01:48.220
What are you
gonna do?

01:48.220 --> 01:50.730
I'm gonna sketch
the moonlit lake.

01:50.730 --> 01:51.730
Look, I know you
like to draw,

01:51.730 --> 01:53.230
but do you think this
is the right time?

01:53.230 --> 01:54.730
I'm sorry, Rich,
I'm not in the mood.

01:55.230 --> 01:56.730
I mean, that's
four cramps for Ralph

01:56.730 --> 02:00.740
and two times Potsie
fell out of the car.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.570
Well, they're very
quiet right now.

02:02.570 --> 02:05.660
Oh, Alma,
your skin is so smooth.

02:05.660 --> 02:09.660
Hands off, that's me.

02:09.660 --> 02:10.880
Smooth skin.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.050
POTSIE:
It was.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.630
Hi, Rich.

02:13.630 --> 02:14.630
Ow, Pots!

02:14.630 --> 02:15.640
Oh, sorry, Ralph.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.970
You're always sorry.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.560
Rich, you know,
your half hour is up.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.060
Potsie, get up front.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.560
Okay, I get the next
30 minutes.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.560
Right.
Come on, Alma,
up and over.

02:24.060 --> 02:24.560
Come on.
Come on now.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.060
Let me get
the backseat alone.

02:26.060 --> 02:27.060
No more than
30 minutes now.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.060
We got the back seat alone.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.070
Come on, her foot's, her foot's

02:29.070 --> 02:32.070
in the ashtray,
Rich, come on, move over.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.070
We got the backseat.
This is much better.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.570
Okay.
Better than the wet grass.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.070
Very good.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.860
Hey.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.620
I'm really sorry
about this.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.620
Not as sorry as I am.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.120
Well, look, we'll
come up here

02:49.120 --> 02:50.620
tomorrow night by
ourselves, okay?

02:50.620 --> 02:52.120
I'd rather not, Richie.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.620
Necking's kind of childish.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.120
If you had your own place...

02:55.120 --> 02:56.130
Would that make
a difference?

02:56.130 --> 02:58.130
Sure it would.

02:58.130 --> 02:59.850
Well, you know, sometimes
my parents go...

02:59.850 --> 03:02.430
Oh, blah, you still
live with your parents?

03:02.430 --> 03:06.940
Oh, no, no,
of course not.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.940
I've got my own place.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.440
Go back to
what you were doing!

03:10.440 --> 03:12.940
Certainly.

03:12.940 --> 03:14.940
You've got
your own place?

03:14.940 --> 03:15.950
Yeah, sure.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.570
How could a high school kid
afford his own apartment?

03:18.570 --> 03:20.650
Well, it's not easy
going to school

03:20.650 --> 03:23.150
and running a mail
order business.

03:23.150 --> 03:25.660
If you have your own place,
then what are we doing out here?

03:25.660 --> 03:26.660
It's being
redecorated.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
Sure it is.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.160
You can see it
tomorrow if you want.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.660
Really?
Yeah.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.750
Oh, I can't wait
to see it.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.750
Neither can I.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.250
MARION:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Watch this, Howard, watch{\r}.</font></font></i>

03:41.250 --> 03:43.340
King Kong.

03:43.340 --> 03:47.340
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh,
Tarzan!

03:47.340 --> 03:49.350
Well, what else
could it be?!

03:49.350 --> 03:52.850
It's <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">The Wild Ones
with Marlon Brando{\r}.</font></font></i>

03:52.850 --> 03:55.850
I don't remember any
monkeys in <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">The Wild Ones{\r}.</font></font></i>

03:55.850 --> 03:57.850
Monkeys? This is
a motorcycle, Howard.

03:57.850 --> 04:00.360
How do you get a motorcycle
from that, Marion?!

04:00.360 --> 04:03.280
This is a
motorcycle!

04:04.690 --> 04:06.700
(sighs):
Oh, Howard,

04:06.700 --> 04:09.750
playing charades isn't much fun
with two people.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.340
We're not playing, Marion,
we are practicing charades,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.840
for the championship
of the Leopard Lodge!

04:15.840 --> 04:17.839
And I do not intend
finishing last

04:17.839 --> 04:19.339
for the fourth year in a row.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.839
And do you know why
we always finish last?

04:21.839 --> 04:23.380
No, dear. Why?

04:23.380 --> 04:25.100
I'll tell you why.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.180
Two words.
Mm-hmm.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.680
One, one w---
first word.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.190
Uh, little, little.

04:29.190 --> 04:30.190
Eye!

04:30.190 --> 04:31.690
Uh, second word.

04:31.690 --> 04:33.190
Nose, smell, stink.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.190
I stink!

04:34.190 --> 04:35.690
You got it!

04:39.150 --> 04:42.150
Richard, we're
playing charades.

04:42.150 --> 04:44.150
Now, what is this?
What is this?

04:44.150 --> 04:46.040
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">The Wild Ones{\r}.</font></font></i>

04:46.040 --> 04:49.240
That's my son.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.870
Two of a kind.

04:50.870 --> 04:53.960
Tell your son
he's home late.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
All right, that's it!

04:55.960 --> 04:57.460
I've had it!

04:57.460 --> 05:00.470
I'm 18 years old, and I'm
still treated like a kid.

05:00.470 --> 05:01.970
Guys my age are
in the mail order business

05:01.970 --> 05:03.970
and they have
their own apartments.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.970
Oh, just forget it!

05:05.970 --> 05:07.010
Oh, calm
down, dear.

05:07.010 --> 05:08.590
Well, these are nice pictures.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.090
Oh, look, there's Lake Michigan.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.100
Look at this one,
Potsie's kissing.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.320
What's that behind
Potsie's head?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.820
Ralph's foot.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.320
Look, everybody's
having a great time.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.820
Do you notice where I am?

05:21.820 --> 05:23.820
Yeah, you're right there
next to that rock.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.830
Yeah, that's right,
me and a rock,

05:25.830 --> 05:27.740
not me and a girl,
me and a rock.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.110
I'm tired of being treated
like a kid all the time.

05:30.110 --> 05:32.700
Well, we think of you as
a man, don't we, Howard?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
Well, of course we do.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.950
Now, you see
there, dear?

05:34.950 --> 05:36.540
Now, why don't you
just go on up to bed,

05:36.540 --> 05:38.840
and I'll come up later
with some milk and cookies.

05:44.790 --> 05:45.880
Give me a kiss right here.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.380
That's nice, yeah.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.880
Oh, sorry, Fonz. I forgot
it's cleaning day.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.380
I'll talk to you
after school.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.380
Cunningham, get back in here.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.890
The cleaning crew
was just leaving.

05:53.890 --> 05:55.390
All right, girls.

05:55.390 --> 05:59.060
You earned your kisses
and your car fare.

05:59.060 --> 06:02.150
Boy... you got the life, Fonz.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.230
Are you kidding?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.730
Look at this dust,
look at this dust.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.230
You know,
I had a girl once, Melinda,

06:06.730 --> 06:07.730
now she really liked to clean.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.370
I mean, she knew her lint.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.820
I got something to ask you,
and it's a favor.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.410
But I'm gonna ask you right out,
no beating around the bush,

06:14.410 --> 06:17.410
just head-to-head,
man-to-man.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.380
Shoot.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.460
I lied to a girl, Fonz.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.460
I told her that I had
my own apartment, and I,

06:21.460 --> 06:23.470
I'm gonna be stuck if you don't
let me use your place.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.750
What do you say?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.340
I say that every chick in town

06:26.340 --> 06:27.250
knows I live here.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.840
This girl's new in town, Fonz.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.840
Listen to this,
she's an art student.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
And she used to hang out
in Greenwich Village.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
(chuckles)

06:33.840 --> 06:35.340
Greenwich Village, Fonz.

06:35.340 --> 06:38.060
She's wild about me, she thinks
I got sexy cheekbones.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.150
Well, never
let it be said

06:40.150 --> 06:43.650
that the Fonz stands in
the way of sexy cheekbones.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.660
All right, tiger,
it's yours.

06:46.660 --> 06:47.660
Want a slug?

06:47.660 --> 06:49.490
Oh, no thanks, Fonz.
This is great.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.580
This is gonna be perfect.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.580
See, I'm an adult now,
and I'm getting tired of

06:52.580 --> 06:54.580
six people in a car,
everything's so crowded,

06:54.580 --> 06:56.580
Ralph's foot comes sticking up
in the middle,

06:56.580 --> 06:57.830
somebody honks the horn...
Cunningham,

06:57.830 --> 06:59.420
Cunningham, Cunningham,
I understand.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.420
You're an adult now,
you want an adult evening.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.460
So pick a night.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.840
Really?
Any night.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.920
Tonight.
Forget it.

07:06.930 --> 07:08.380
I-I need my rest.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.460
On Saturday night?

07:09.460 --> 07:11.050
Yeah, I like to stay home

07:11.050 --> 07:12.050
on amateur night.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.300
Fonz, I set the date
for tonight.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.390
Yeah, but I am exhausted.

07:17.390 --> 07:19.610
Yesterday, I fell asleep
on piston rings.

07:19.610 --> 07:22.190
Look, I don't even need
a whole night, Fonz.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.690
I'm just asking for half
a night, just till 12:00, huh?

07:24.690 --> 07:26.200
What do you say
about that?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.700
I say, why am I such
a sweetheart of a guy?

07:28.700 --> 07:30.820
Oh, thanks, Fonz.

07:30.820 --> 07:31.900
That's all right.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
Now, I bet you want me
to help you

07:33.400 --> 07:34.870
once, uh, once the girl
gets in here, right?

07:34.870 --> 07:35.960
I don't know.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.410
I'm pretty good in a car.

07:37.410 --> 07:38.990
(laughing)

07:41.490 --> 07:43.000
Oh, so cute, "in a car."

07:43.000 --> 07:44.500
This is different.
Sit down.

07:46.830 --> 07:47.920
Take this down,
Cunningham.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.250
Yeah, sure.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.340
All right.

07:50.340 --> 07:52.840
The Fonz will now recite

07:52.840 --> 07:55.760
on H.W.W.,
How to Win Women.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.400
Phase one.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.900
Your basic music,
a little poetry,

08:02.900 --> 08:04.180
you share an arepitif with her.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.900
Phase two.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.410
Anything that she likes,
you like.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.530
Anything she hates, hate.

08:12.530 --> 08:15.190
Well, what if she likes
something that's stupid?

08:15.190 --> 08:18.830
Richard, do you want to win
a debate or win a girl?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.920
Win a girl.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.030
All right.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.620
Phase three.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.920
You drop a couple of hints
that you might be willing.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.290
Willing to what?

08:29.590 --> 08:31.010
Phase four.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.630
Oh.

08:32.630 --> 08:34.710
I got to go to work,
Cunningham.

08:34.710 --> 08:35.679
Oh, uh, Fonz?

08:35.679 --> 08:38.720
Uh, how long should it take
to-to get to phase four?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.390
Well, I'd give yourself,
three to five minutes.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.470
Wait a minute.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.280
Hey, you-you do all
this in five minutes?

08:46.280 --> 08:47.860
Oh, no, no,
the first three are for you,

08:47.860 --> 08:49.860
I move right to phase four.
Whoa!

08:57.040 --> 08:58.620
Why don't you
get some sleep?

09:03.130 --> 09:04.130
You all
right, Fonz?

09:04.130 --> 09:06.130
Cunningham, I am not
gonna make it.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.920
These eyes will not
stay open till 12:00.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.500
Oh, sure they can, Fonz.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.080
You're a sweetheart of a guy.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.670
I am a beat sweetheart.

09:14.670 --> 09:17.170
Look, I understand
you want an adult evening.

09:17.170 --> 09:19.180
Pick any other night.

09:19.180 --> 09:21.180
I'll give you the pad,
I'll give you the champagne,

09:21.180 --> 09:23.260
I will supply the adult.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.350
I've got
the adult.

09:25.350 --> 09:28.350
Look, Fonz, all you have to
do is stay awake until 12:00!

09:28.350 --> 09:31.350
Richard, yelling
hurts my feelings.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.360
You're right,
you're right.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.360
I got to stay calm and
just think of a plan.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.860
I got it.
I got it.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.860
I got a
great idea.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.860
JOANIE:
Oh!
Mind your
own business.

09:41.860 --> 09:44.370
Fonz, my parents
are leaving.

09:44.370 --> 09:45.670
You can stay
in my room.

09:45.670 --> 09:46.750
No, I don't think so.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.340
I'm not very comfortable
under a Roy Rogers blanket.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.930
Oh, I got rid of that
a long time ago.

09:52.930 --> 09:54.930
Fonz, we couldn't ask
for a better night.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.930
My parents are going to
the movies with Alfred.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.430
Look, you can
sleep in my room.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.930
We'll switch
in the morning.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.430
I'll come in there
and wake you up.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.720
Nobody will
ever know.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.800
What about Joanie?

10:04.300 --> 10:04.800
Joanie's easy.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.520
(whispering)

10:06.520 --> 10:08.110
(knocking)
Joanie, don't bother
us right now!

10:08.110 --> 10:11.110
Hey, hey, hey, I think
that's the front door.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.450
What would he
do without me?

10:13.450 --> 10:15.530
Oh, come on in,
Alfred.

10:15.530 --> 10:16.530
Hi, Richie.
How are you?

10:16.530 --> 10:18.400
This is Maria.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.900
Oh, pleasant
meeting you, Maria.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.490
She doesn't understand
any English; just smile.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.990
She's from Salerno.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.490
This is Fonzie.

10:26.490 --> 10:27.990
Fonzie, this is Maria.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.500
She doesn't speak
any English; just smile.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.380
And this is...
I know,
I know.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.090
She doesn't speak any
English; I was smiling.

10:36.090 --> 10:38.000
ALFRED:
Oh, don't-
don't-don't,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.590
don't touch, no, no.

10:39.590 --> 10:42.090
That's a Leopard Lodge hat.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.090
See? Look.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.600
Leopard-o Lodge-o.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.820
Leopard...
(growls)

10:49.820 --> 10:51.900
Ah, ah, ah, Alfred.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.900
Take the hat off.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
You're not a Lodge member yet,
you got to earn that.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.410
Oh. You know
how bad I want it.

10:58.410 --> 10:59.910
Oh.
How do you do,
how do you do?

10:59.910 --> 11:01.410
We better hurry up
or we're gonna

11:01.410 --> 11:02.410
miss the beginning
of the movie.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.410
I'm Marion.
Oh, what a lovely suit.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.420
Children, we'll be
back in a minute.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.420
Uh, I got this at
Murray's Department Store.

11:08.420 --> 11:11.670
Maybe we'll go shopping
together sometime.

11:11.670 --> 11:15.420
Marion's talking to a girl who
doesn't understand any English.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.510
Don't worry about it.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.460
She won't find it out
for at least an hour.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.300
Well, I'm really tired.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.850
I think I'm just
gonna go on

11:24.850 --> 11:26.440
up to my room
and go to bed.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
Oh, yeah,
me, too.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.890
Man, I-I hope I make it
up all those steps.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.890
Good night, Shortcake.

11:36.950 --> 11:37.950
I don't believe it.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.950
I lead the most exciting life
around here,

11:39.950 --> 11:41.950
and I'm doing the dishes.

11:44.950 --> 11:45.960
(whispers):
Here's pajamas.
Hey, I don't
wear...

11:46.460 --> 11:47.460
My mother...
I will, Richie.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.410
Right.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.380
Richie, is that you?

11:51.380 --> 11:53.460
Uh...

11:53.460 --> 11:55.460
(imitating Richie):
Oh, golly, oh, gee.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.470
Yeah, it's me.

11:59.470 --> 12:01.800
Good night.
Uh, don't let the bedbugs bite.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.340
I must be getting tired;
he sounds just like <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Howdy Doody{\r}.</font></font></i>

No, no, no--
that's Funzie.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040

Oh.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.050
Listen, why don't
you sit down?

13:17.050 --> 13:18.910
Sit down and relax.
Okay.

13:28.010 --> 13:30.510
Oh, you're so
funny, Richie.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.510
Yeah, fun.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.850

Hello?

13:39.940 --> 13:41.940
He's not here right now.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.440
Well, listen, I'm very
busy right now,

13:44.440 --> 13:45.940
and you're just going to
have to wait your turn

13:45.940 --> 13:48.440
like everybody else.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.950
These people, they
won't leave me alone.

13:50.950 --> 13:52.700

Yeah.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.250
Can I take off your sweater?
Huh?

Oh, I mean, you can
leave it on if you want,

13:58.290 --> 13:59.790
but I thought you
might be a little warm.

13:59.790 --> 14:01.790
Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah.

14:01.790 --> 14:02.790
Hey, Richie.

14:02.790 --> 14:04.790
Yeah?
May I use your bathroom?

14:04.790 --> 14:06.300
Oh sure, I got one
of those, too.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.130
Oh, Richie, I like this place.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.130
I mean, I love
what you've done to it.

14:11.130 --> 14:13.140
I feel comfortable
and relaxed

14:13.140 --> 14:15.140
just like a Greenwich Village
hideaway.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.640
I can just let my hair down

Sure is.

That's why I trust him.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.680
As a matter of fact,
he's been home all evening.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.680
What makes you say that?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.190
I felt the hood of his car.

16:26.190 --> 16:27.190
It wasn't even warm.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.190
I thought you
trusted him.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.190
I do trust him.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.190
I was just checking
up on him, that's all.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.500
You know, Al's girlfriend
is a lovely person.
Mmm...

16:36.500 --> 16:39.280
It took me an hour to realize
she didn't understand English.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.280
(doorbell rings)

16:41.280 --> 16:44.370
She's terrible at charades.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.870
I wonder who it could be
at this late hour.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.010
Mrs. Cunningham?

16:49.010 --> 16:50.090
Yes.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.090
I'm Chief Petty
Officer Kendall,

16:52.090 --> 16:53.100
Cindy's father.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.100
We didn't want to rat
on Richie, he forced us.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.600
He pulled us
right out of Arnold's.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.970
We thought we
were drafted.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.050
How do you do?

17:00.050 --> 17:01.050
I'm Mr. Cunningham.

17:01.050 --> 17:03.560
Uh, would you mind telling me
what's going on here?

17:04.060 --> 17:05.109
Sir.

17:05.109 --> 17:05.970
Chief.
Oh.

17:05.970 --> 17:07.560
Excuse me, ma'am.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.560
Your son is out
with my daughter.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.060
She was supposed
to be home at 2300.

17:12.060 --> 17:15.319
It's now 2400 and I have
to be on duty at 0100.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.900
Why is he talking
in numbers?

17:20.410 --> 17:22.410
Military talk, Marion.

17:22.410 --> 17:23.540
I'll explain it later.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.160
Oh, you were in the service?

17:25.160 --> 17:27.500
I was in the Army.
I was a cook.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.420
Well, cooks always do eat better
than anybody else.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.500
Relax, Howard.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.920
May I take your hat?

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
Okay, I'm bald.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.560
Now, where's my daughter?

17:39.560 --> 17:42.640
Well, she isn't
with Richie.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.650
He's upstairs all rolled up
in a cute little ball.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.980
He's so cute
when he sleeps.

17:47.980 --> 17:50.570
Well, your cute son, Richie,

17:50.570 --> 17:53.610
picked up my daughter tonight
at 1900 hours.

17:53.610 --> 17:56.440
Well, maybe she's out
with a different Richard.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.530
Well, he's a redheaded kid
with freckles,

17:58.530 --> 17:59.530
and he's very polite.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.410
That's him.
That's him.
Aha!

18:01.410 --> 18:02.920
Marion,

18:02.920 --> 18:06.000
you go on upstairs
and check on Richie,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.500
but if he's still
sleeping don't wake him.

18:09.510 --> 18:10.960
Uh, won't you
sit down, Chief?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.510
Well, I hate to bother you
about all of this,

18:13.510 --> 18:15.590
but I just transferred
into this area.

18:15.590 --> 18:16.680
Cindy's a Navy brat.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.680
Now, I know
your son may be okay,

18:18.680 --> 18:21.630
but, well, my daughter
is kind of wild.

18:21.630 --> 18:22.720
"Wild"?

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
Does she have a sister?

18:26.470 --> 18:28.560
All right, that's enough.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.560
You guys, home.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.530
(Ralph and Potsie protest)
Come on, come on...

18:31.530 --> 18:34.060
All right, attention!

18:34.060 --> 18:36.530
Right face!
Forward march.

18:36.530 --> 18:39.070
Hup, two, three,
four, hup!

18:39.070 --> 18:41.570
Howie?
Hup-two,
hup-two, hup-two!

18:48.910 --> 18:52.210
Now, that's the way
to handle those boys.
Thanks.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.750
FONZIE (laughing):
Hey, hey...

18:58.800 --> 18:59.810
What was that?

18:59.810 --> 19:03.260
I am afraid to ask.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.770
That's not the
redheaded kid.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.270
Well, it must have
been some movie.

19:13.270 --> 19:15.270
You brought home
the usher.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.780
Fonzie, will you please

19:22.780 --> 19:24.500
tell me what
you're doing here?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.110
Amnesia?

19:26.110 --> 19:27.700
No.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.670
Sleepwalking?
Unh-uh.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.000
I'm open to suggestions.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.090
Come on, Fonzie!

19:33.090 --> 19:35.010
This is serious.
Now, where's Richie?

19:35.010 --> 19:36.880
I don't know, could be
any number of places.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.840
Aha!
But how did you know

19:38.840 --> 19:41.350
he wouldn't be in his room?

19:41.350 --> 19:42.350
I got lucky.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.350
Uh-huh.
Don't pay any attention to him.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.350
(all talking at once)

19:52.360 --> 19:54.940
Hello.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.950
Hey, listen,
I think I know what you want.

19:56.950 --> 20:00.070
I'll go and find Richie
and Cindy for you.
You know where they are?

20:00.070 --> 20:01.650
No, no, I don't know
where they are.

20:01.650 --> 20:03.650
I have no idea,
but don't worry about it.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.650
I mean, the Fonz
is like a bloodhound.

20:05.650 --> 20:07.160
(sniffs)

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
Maybe they're
at Inspiration Point.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.160
Uh-huh.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.160
Well, Fonzie
is a very nice boy

20:15.160 --> 20:16.670
and if he says
he will find them,

20:16.670 --> 20:18.470
I'm just sure that he will.

20:18.470 --> 20:20.550
So why don't we just
sit down and relax?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.550
Do you have a tattoo?
Marion!

20:24.310 --> 20:26.890
Well, I guess it's
time to take a break.

20:26.890 --> 20:29.900
Yeah. I like it
like that.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.400
Draw a picture,
take a little break.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.930
Draw a picture,
take a little break.

20:35.930 --> 20:39.490
Hey, Cunningham, you're doing
real great on phase four.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.490
Did I ever describe
phase five to you?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.330
What's phase five?
Run for your life.

20:43.330 --> 20:44.580
The chick's father's
coming up the stairs.

20:44.580 --> 20:45.660
My father?
He'll kill me!

20:45.660 --> 20:47.160
All right, all
right, just cool it.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.160
Cool it, cool it, cool it.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.670
Get dressed.
Right.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.670
Where is your coat?
My coat's
right over...

20:51.670 --> 20:53.170
It's in the bed!
That's my boy!

20:53.170 --> 20:54.170
(indistinct chatter)

20:54.170 --> 20:55.670
My father's gonna kill us.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.670
All right, all right,
just take it easy.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.680
Just take it easy,
nice and cool.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.180
Get out of here before
they figure this out.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.260
We figured
it out.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.760
What is...?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.520
But we didn't
figure on this!

21:07.880 --> 21:09.470
What is
going on?

21:09.470 --> 21:10.970
I know what's going on.

21:10.970 --> 21:11.890
I'm a sailor.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.860
Look, Kendall,
they're just children.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.360
I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical explanation for this.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.860
An Army cook is going
to tell me about life?

21:20.860 --> 21:22.360
(Howard mutters)

21:22.360 --> 21:23.370
Joanie, go
to your room!

21:23.370 --> 21:25.370
What are you
yelling at me for?

21:25.370 --> 21:27.790
I was the only one
in the right bed.

21:27.790 --> 21:28.870
(indistinct chatter)

21:28.870 --> 21:30.870
Joanie, will you get out
of here?

21:30.870 --> 21:33.880
(all talking at once)

21:33.880 --> 21:36.880
All right, all right, time out!

21:36.880 --> 21:38.130
Hold it!

21:38.130 --> 21:39.210
(silence)

21:39.210 --> 21:40.720
FONZIE:
Now, listen,

21:40.720 --> 21:43.220
I think you're all
very charming, but the thing is,

21:43.220 --> 21:46.810
this is what you might call
a middle class problem, you see?

21:46.810 --> 21:48.810
And I can't be of any help

21:48.810 --> 21:51.310
since I'm in a class
all by myself.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.810
So why don't you just
take this on down

21:53.810 --> 21:55.480
to your middle class
living room?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.570
He's right. Come on,
let's all go downstairs.

21:57.570 --> 21:58.770
We'll settle it there.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.850
Come on.
Richard?

22:02.850 --> 22:04.360
Oh, uh,

22:04.360 --> 22:05.520
Cunningham?

22:05.520 --> 22:07.160
Good luck.
HOWARD:
Richard,

22:07.160 --> 22:08.240
we're waiting!

22:08.240 --> 22:11.160
Phase six--
explaining to my father.

22:18.290 --> 22:20.290
Hey, Jim, you were here.

22:20.290 --> 22:22.290
Just answer me one question.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.790
How'd he get the coat
in the bed?

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
Well?

22:31.720 --> 22:33.720
Okay, okay, I'll admit

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
these sketches
must have taken a lot of time,

22:35.720 --> 22:37.860
but who knows
what else they did?

22:37.860 --> 22:40.940
Listen, Kendall,
I know my son,
and if he says

22:40.940 --> 22:43.730
all they did was draw
sketches, then I believe him.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.620
KENDALL:
Well,

22:46.620 --> 22:47.700
maybe you're right.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.700
Cindy, let's go home.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.200
We can talk about this
tomorrow at 0600.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.210
That's 6:00 a.m.

22:54.210 --> 22:55.210
Bye, Richie.

22:55.210 --> 22:58.210
I hope I get to sketch
you again sometime.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.210
Yeah, sure, we'll draw a little,
take a little break, yeah.

23:02.210 --> 23:05.300
Okay, wait
in the jeep, sailor.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.800
Uh... Cindy.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.800
Sorry, honey.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.810
You know, I just
don't understand it.

23:10.810 --> 23:14.310
I handle 1,700 raw recruits,
and they tow the line.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.430
With my own daughter,
I got no communication.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.510
She's not
Navy, Kendall.

23:19.510 --> 23:21.020
She's your daughter.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.020
Why don't you try
talking to her?

23:23.020 --> 23:25.100
But I'm a busy man.
I don't have the time.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.190
Well, you found enough
time to have her.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.110
Can't you find some
time to spend with her?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.080
Thanks. I'll try.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.580
You know, I don't know why
she never sketches me.

23:36.580 --> 23:37.580
I mean, I'm easy.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.040
It isn't as if
you have to draw hair.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.540
I have a very simple face.

23:46.510 --> 23:48.510
You know, Dad,
I really appreciate

23:48.510 --> 23:50.430
the way you backed me up.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.300
Oh.
You really
must trust me.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.880
Well, of course I trust you.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.380
Yeah.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.270
Richie, what really
happened, huh?

24:12.820 --> 24:14.400
Well, Dad,
it's-it's getting a little late.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
You're not going
to lecture me tonight, are you?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.410
No, I'm not going to
give you a lecture.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.910
Look, Richie, I know
you're getting older,

24:20.910 --> 24:24.410
and you want to be an adult
and do things that adults do.

24:24.910 --> 24:25.910
Yeah, I sure do.

24:25.910 --> 24:28.420
Well, I'm not going
to stop you.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.420
I couldn't if
I wanted to.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.920
But just remember, if
you ever need my help,

24:32.920 --> 24:34.810
you can always
come to me.

24:34.810 --> 24:38.430
I may yell at you a little
bit, but I'll help you.

24:38.430 --> 24:39.510
Thanks, Dad.
Mm.

24:39.510 --> 24:41.010
Do you think next week

24:41.010 --> 24:43.180
you could help me look
for an apartment?

24:43.180 --> 24:44.850
What?!

24:44.850 --> 24:46.430
Upstairs!
Oh...

24:46.430 --> 24:47.940
Hut, two, three,
four, come on.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.440
All right...
Hut, two,
hut, two.
