14:03.685 --> 14:05.103
- Yes.
- And all true.

14:05.186 --> 14:06.438
Donna... Here, let me get them.

14:08.773 --> 14:12.110
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?

14:14.279 --> 14:17.866
<i>- Bloke in a Boat in Botswana.</i>
- Yes, I am.

14:17.949 --> 14:21.119
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.

14:21.202 --> 14:24.038
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,

14:24.122 --> 14:28.752
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.795
You should try it for real sometime.

14:30.879 --> 14:33.923
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.

14:34.007 --> 14:38.261
- You're a close friend of Donna's?
- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.014
- SAM: Really?
- And then this invite, out of the blue.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.849
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.477
- Going about!
- You got it!

14:45.560 --> 14:50.857
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.487
ROSIE: You should have brought
the iron lung.

14:55.612 --> 14:58.073
Why did I wear stilettos?

14:58.865 --> 15:00.950
- (GASPING) Oxygen.
- Oh, my God!

15:02.577 --> 15:04.871
- Auntie Rosie!
- Hey, hey!

15:04.954 --> 15:09.292
- Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
- I know.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.795
ROSIE: Come here to me.

15:13.296 --> 15:20.220
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.

15:20.303 --> 15:24.307
- I bet you don't remember me.
- Not with all that plastic surgery.

15:25.016 --> 15:28.728
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.147
- I'm so happy for you.
- Look at my baby,

15:31.231 --> 15:33.900
her whole life ahead of her.

15:33.983 --> 15:39.239
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!

15:39.322 --> 15:41.324
- She's feisty. I love that.
- Yeah.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.701
She's a chip off the old block.

15:44.494 --> 15:47.664
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.416
Or married at all.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.670
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.796
ROSIE: Tanya's going home!

15:54.879 --> 15:57.841
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

15:57.924 --> 16:00.885
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

16:00.969 --> 16:03.221
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

16:03.304 --> 16:04.639
making them again.

16:04.723 --> 16:06.349
I know you, Mom.

16:07.559 --> 16:11.479
But I am good at modern...
Tell them about the Internets.

16:11.563 --> 16:13.690
- He's gonna put me on the line.
- SOPHIE: Online.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.150
SKY: I'm designing a website.

16:15.233 --> 16:19.404
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.

16:19.487 --> 16:23.867
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

16:23.950 --> 16:27.871
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.331
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

16:30.415 --> 16:32.917
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

16:33.001 --> 16:35.712
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.715
- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.675
<i>TANYA: Aphrodite's spa?</i>

16:40.759 --> 16:43.261
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

16:43.386 --> 16:45.388
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.892
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

16:50.268 --> 16:54.230
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

16:54.314 --> 16:59.402
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...

17:00.570 --> 17:03.073
Nothing works around here, except for me.

17:03.156 --> 17:07.410
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

17:07.493 --> 17:08.744

- Nope.

No! You keep your hands to yourself,

28:58.329 --> 29:00.957
Harry! It is you!

29:09.716 --> 29:11.342

29:18.016 --> 29:20.351
(STAMMERING) Okay. What is this?

29:20.435 --> 29:24.314
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

share a common thought.

29:27.692 --> 29:28.985
Strangers?

29:29.861 --> 29:33.656
- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

29:33.865 --> 29:36.826
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

29:36.910 --> 29:39.204
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

29:39.287 --> 29:40.830
- BILL: Didn't catch the name.
- Greek lady.

29:40.914 --> 29:42.665
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

29:42.749 --> 29:44.918
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

29:45.001 --> 29:47.003
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

29:47.087 --> 29:49.672
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

29:49.756 --> 29:52.717
I'm closed and I'm full.

29:52.801 --> 29:56.638
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

- I'm spontaneous.

30:03.770 --> 30:05.146
- Spontaneous.
- DONNA: Ah.

30:07.357 --> 30:09.067
What about you?

30:09.150 --> 30:11.361
Just wanted to see the island.

30:11.861 --> 30:14.072
You know what it meant to me.

30:16.241 --> 30:19.452
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

30:19.536 --> 30:23.039

30:23.123 --> 30:25.125
- I have a boat, Donna.
- You have a boat?

Good, get on it,

30:26.626 --> 30:27.836

- I think she went down to the beach.
- What's up?

(CRYING)

31:01.578 --> 31:02.787

Sam the architect,

34:04.677 --> 34:06.262

34:06.346 --> 34:09.641
I'm not sure that it was him,

34:09.724 --> 34:14.312
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

34:15.563 --> 34:18.733
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

34:18.817 --> 34:20.193
Why didn't you tell us?

34:20.275 --> 34:23.862
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

34:23.947 --> 34:27.074
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

34:27.158 --> 34:28.784

34:28.868 --> 34:31.454

Of course I'm sure!

Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

They were all here. Sam Carmichael,

ROSIE: Harry "Head Banger."

DONNA: They must've gone
back to their boat.

35:05.447 --> 35:08.116
I hope they run aground and drown.

35:08.199 --> 35:09.909
What are they doing here?

35:09.993 --> 35:11.661
It's like some hideous trick of fate.

Oh, Donna,

35:36.144 --> 35:38.396
It doesn't matter about me.

35:38.480 --> 35:44.027
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.

35:44.110 --> 35:46.362
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.

I don't know that.

I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.171
And I have brought this all on myself

and you didn't tell me?

And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

01:13:36.466 --> 01:13:39.803
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:42.764
That doesn't come from finding your father,

01:13:43.139 --> 01:13:45.558
that comes from finding yourself.

01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:50.063
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

01:13:51.439 --> 01:13:53.900
I put everything on hold for you.

01:13:56.236 --> 01:13:58.738

and I wanted what you wanted.

You don't know if you love me?

01:14:02.242 --> 01:14:05.328
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.832
Is everything okay?

01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:11.793
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

01:14:11.876 --> 01:14:13.461
Yes, yes, yes, now.

01:14:13.545 --> 01:14:15.630
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

01:14:15.714 --> 01:14:17.799
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

01:14:17.882 --> 01:14:21.052
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

01:14:21.136 --> 01:14:23.972
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

01:14:24.055 --> 01:14:27.767
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:30.645

in the world. And I...
