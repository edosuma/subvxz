00:13.013 --> 00:13.980
Hello.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.418
Hi.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.953
You are Raul Fagnani, right?

00:20.620 --> 00:22.122
Am I famous now?

00:22.789 --> 00:24.357
The lady told me you'd arrived

00:24.424 --> 00:27.060
on a rundown car.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.098
Is it your truck?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.133
Yes.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.403
I need to find Jô, the driver,

00:36.469 --> 00:37.670
and know if he's okay.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.472
What is inside the truck?

00:40.206 --> 00:41.174
Sulfuric acid.

00:41.741 --> 00:42.709
Come.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.449
Follow me.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.223
EPISODE:
JOSLEY

02:24.410 --> 02:25.378
Is that Jô?

02:27.847 --> 02:29.482
No, it looks like a dog.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.551
Dog's teeth.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.786
The acid didn't leave much.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.162
Listen,

02:42.228 --> 02:43.830
I love money.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.565
But I offer my services

02:45.632 --> 02:47.700
only if I know
what I'm dealing with.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.701
Why am I here?

02:49.402 --> 02:51.404
Why haven't you called
the police?

02:53.606 --> 02:57.443
A truck has crashed
and a driver is missing.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.213
It's not an investigation
of a lifetime.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.683
Besides,
they would take too long.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.385
I...

03:05.718 --> 03:07.987
I have lost half a million
in goods

03:08.054 --> 03:09.122
because of this.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.490
If the insurance company
doesn't pay me,

03:10.557 --> 03:12.125
I will be forced to shut down.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.327
I get it.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.729
You're in a hurry.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.432
You have to know
I don't perform miracles.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.668
I sometimes do,
but not too often.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.772
I'll give you 50 percent more
than what you get

03:25.838 --> 03:28.174
for the emergency
of this situation.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.976
-Fifty percent more?
-Yes.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.178
Listen,

03:32.946 --> 03:34.247
if I don't have
an investigation,

03:34.314 --> 03:35.815
the insurance company
won't pay me.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.050
They will want to find
the driver

03:37.116 --> 03:39.485
to talk to him
and figure out what happened.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.887
With no clear answer,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.088
they won't pay me!

03:43.656 --> 03:45.992
How do you know
they will accept my answer?

03:47.193 --> 03:50.263
They suggested I talk to you.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.533
Raul Fagnani!

03:54.467 --> 03:56.135
Hélio told me
you'd take the case,

03:56.202 --> 03:57.503
so I came here immediately.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.339
I admire your work so much.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.408
Celso Fontes,
FAMA Insurance Company.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.845
-How are you?
-I could be better.

04:05.912 --> 04:10.183
I don't mean to brag,
but I do some investigation too.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.485
Hey, did you tell the police?

04:13.152 --> 04:14.487
How did they get here?

04:14.554 --> 04:15.521
Anonymous complaint.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.627
It seems the truck was cut off
and crashed.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.364
Everyone took off.
There's no trace of the driver.

04:26.065 --> 04:30.203
Do you have any reason
to suspect the driver?

04:40.346 --> 04:41.314
Hey!

04:42.048 --> 04:44.217
He's a great man,
a hard-working man.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.155
You never know
what's on somebody's mind.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.826
You know,
I used to be a truck driver.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.662
I have a fleet now,

04:55.728 --> 04:57.096
but I don't forget
where I come from.

04:58.898 --> 05:04.003
Maybe he needs me right now.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.872
These people don't have
anyone to turn to.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.541
Is there any chance
of finding him?

05:09.375 --> 05:10.343
Tai?

05:10.710 --> 05:13.046
Check the security cameras

05:13.112 --> 05:14.747
and the passersby, okay?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.750
There is always a chance.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.786
But I don't work with miracles.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.021
Let's get to work!

05:38.504 --> 05:39.972
CANDY PALACE

05:40.039 --> 05:41.641
I can't believe it!

05:42.608 --> 05:44.544
I'll give you 500, Waldir.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.212
Really?

05:46.713 --> 05:48.614
No, Waldir, of course not!

05:48.681 --> 05:49.649
Are you insane?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.153
Check this out.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.255
This vinyl record

05:57.056 --> 05:58.558
is a relic that my mother
gave to me.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.027
She used to listen to it

06:01.094 --> 06:04.530
sitting on a checkered sofa
drinking a nice Scotch.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.232
Careful!

06:06.299 --> 06:07.900
Every time I use this record,

06:07.967 --> 06:11.104
it's like I could smell
that moment.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.112
Nice!

06:26.419 --> 06:27.787
Shall we dance?

06:28.421 --> 06:29.389
Just a little bit.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.557
Excuse me!

06:31.891 --> 06:33.192
I need more room.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.228
Okay.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.929
Party is over!

06:37.997 --> 06:40.099
-Come on, Raul!
-Let's resume this case.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.634
Okay.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.637
Josley Soares. Known as Jô.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.305
Truck driver.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.808
He worked at our client's
transport company.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.310
He was last seen
leaving the company

06:51.377 --> 06:53.179
with a cargo of sulfuric acid.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.948
The truck crashed,
the cargo spilled out

06:56.015 --> 06:57.116
and Josley disappeared.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.151
This is his phone number.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.419
Wow!

07:00.453 --> 07:02.355
Is it your, Waldir?
I'll give you 200.

07:02.789 --> 07:03.923
-What?
-Do you want 200?

07:04.690 --> 07:05.758
Stop it, Raul!

07:05.825 --> 07:06.959
Josley, you said?

07:07.460 --> 07:09.095
Does he have
family, a girlfriend?

07:09.162 --> 07:12.598
No family. Few friends,
mostly from work.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.635
No girlfriend,
according to his boss.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.670
This number
is out of coverage area.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.704
You try, Tai.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.774
He is on social media,
but he's not active.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.477
He posted two horrible photos
five years ago.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.714
I'll try and look him up
on dating sites.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.683
I loved that!

07:31.384 --> 07:32.652
What are you saying, Edith?

07:32.985 --> 07:35.254
I'm sorry. I'm nostalgic.

07:35.321 --> 07:36.522
Does he have a credit card?

07:36.589 --> 07:39.892
He was a truck driver
with a short-term contract.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.628
Credit card companies
wouldn't give him a credit card.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.066
We know the trucks
from client Hélio's fleet

07:47.733 --> 07:49.235
fill the tanks

07:49.302 --> 07:51.237
at a gas station leaving Osasco

07:52.438 --> 07:54.140
There's a tavern over there.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.077
Truck drivers meet,
have lunch, have dinner.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.746
It's called "Parada dos Irmãos."

08:00.813 --> 08:03.216
I know that place! They play
really good music.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.418
Flour-based food.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.153
What is it called?
"Parada dos Irmãos"?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.521
"Parada dos Irmãos."

08:08.588 --> 08:09.589
I'm on my way.

08:11.958 --> 08:12.925
What about us?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.295
Josley lives at a hostel
here in the downtown area.

08:16.362 --> 08:19.565
Hopefully he went home to sleep

08:19.632 --> 08:21.234
and is waiting for us to come,

08:21.300 --> 08:24.237
so that we can make
the easiest money on earth.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.408
He's a very good mood today!

08:29.475 --> 08:30.543
-Have you noticed?
-Yes.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.190
And?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.424
What did you get?

08:45.892 --> 08:47.894
Crab louse. Lice, maybe.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.398
Do you think this man
tried to steal the cargo?

08:53.165 --> 08:56.369
A man with no family or friends
living in this dirty place

08:56.435 --> 08:58.037
has nothing to lose.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.473
Let's go.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.915
Would you like a table?
I could take your drinks there.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.219
Do you know Jô? Josley?

09:13.819 --> 09:14.754
From the Pantanal?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.355
He's a good man.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.624
He drinks like a camel.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.560
A camel in Pantanal?

09:22.094 --> 09:23.262
I haven't seen him in a while.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.265
A week or two.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.102
-Who is asking?
-Me.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.905
Listen, if you're a cop

09:32.972 --> 09:34.473
and have accounts
to settle with Jô,

09:34.540 --> 09:35.508
do it outside.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.643
This is just
a quiet drinking place.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.778
That's not the case.

09:38.844 --> 09:40.479
I just want information
about him.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.648
That's how truck drives behave.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.617
They vanish
and then they show up.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.085
That's his job. He will show up.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.888
You don't get it.
Jô disappeared.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.490
He crashed the damn truck
and disappeared.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.959
What I want to know

09:53.826 --> 09:56.128
if there's someone
to mourn his death.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.465
He's in love
with a transvestite.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.701
He is?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.536
Silmara, Suellen,
something like that

10:03.603 --> 10:05.304
Okay, tell me more.

10:06.505 --> 10:07.473
She works in the street.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.278
A guy got a photo of her...

10:13.980 --> 10:16.449
and spread it.
Everyone laughed at Jô.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.317
-I see.
-When he found out

10:18.384 --> 10:21.053
it had been him,
he broke him three teeth.

10:21.721 --> 10:22.722
Do you have the photo?

10:23.189 --> 10:24.423
Everyone in the group has it.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.895
Sent it to me.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.234
Raul!

10:35.301 --> 10:36.268
Hi, love!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.738
Long time no see!

10:38.804 --> 10:39.939
How are you?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.974
Fine, and you?

10:42.041 --> 10:44.577
-Fine too.
-You vanished!

10:44.644 --> 10:45.811
What?

10:45.878 --> 10:49.215
If I came too often,
you'd get tired of me.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.519
Of a handsome man like you?

10:54.186 --> 10:55.221
Never!

10:55.287 --> 10:56.989
I was thinking about you
a few days ago.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.593
I was, and look at this.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.669
I've never been to a ballet.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.904
I know. You told me that.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.040
But I have a friend

11:14.106 --> 11:16.676
who works as a security guard
for the group,

11:17.043 --> 11:18.077
so I remembered you.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.913
If you need a dress,

11:20.980 --> 11:23.049
I can talk to Lorena.

11:23.783 --> 11:24.750
Are you back together?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.987
We're trying

11:28.888 --> 11:29.989
to be...

11:30.056 --> 11:31.290
-Friends.
-Right.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.597
-You're a good friend, Raul.
-You too.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.733
Thanks.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.767
-Tell me.
-What?

11:42.201 --> 11:45.705
This is not why you came.
What do you need?

11:45.771 --> 11:47.807
-Tell me.
-If you insist.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.608
Look.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.045
Do you by any chance know her?

11:53.879 --> 11:57.016
Cynara. Amaral Gurgel Street,
República Park.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.517
You know the way, right?

12:03.189 --> 12:04.156
Get us another one!

12:15.668 --> 12:16.635
And?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.039
The steak is taking too long.

12:21.841 --> 12:22.908
Damn it.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.076
Hey, man!

12:24.810 --> 12:26.345
Do you know what I've been told?

12:27.079 --> 12:29.749
That Josley always meets here
with some guys from a company.

12:29.815 --> 12:30.916
Who are they?

12:30.983 --> 12:33.018
-I don't know, man!
-You don't know?

12:33.452 --> 12:35.921
They took the back table.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.056
They spoke in a low voice.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.625
They paid in cash.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.361
I told you,
we don't want trouble.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.530
Is that your problem?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.266
Okay, they shook hands.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.734
I think they made a deal
or something.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.770
-Get out of my sight!
-Okay.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.928
I think that's her.

13:18.831 --> 13:19.799
Cynara?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.600
Come here!

13:23.202 --> 13:24.170
I just want to talk.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.571
Wait!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.283
I just want to talk.

13:37.349 --> 13:39.218
Nobody comes here just to talk.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.986
If you come closer,
I'll cut you.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.054
It's about Josley.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.889
I don't know any Josley.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.092
I was hired
in order to find him.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.828
Look at this.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.131
See?

13:53.799 --> 13:54.867
He's a client.

13:54.934 --> 13:55.968
That's not what we've been told.

13:56.035 --> 13:59.471
Some clients want beating.
Some others want cuddles.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.374
Professional workers
do what they are paid for.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.177
Listen.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.746
You know what?

14:09.248 --> 14:10.382
I like talking.

14:11.717 --> 14:12.685
Shall we talk?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.923
Do you talk
when you're with Josley?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.792
He likes spooning.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.193
Listening to music.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.328
He's a romantic guy.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.662
Does he talk to you
about his job?

14:23.996 --> 14:26.098
Even if he wanted to,
I wouldn't let him.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.801
Did he mention

14:29.635 --> 14:31.971
a deal he was about to make?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.005
No!

14:34.173 --> 14:35.274
So, you don't know anything?

14:40.012 --> 14:40.980
Okay.

15:17.683 --> 15:18.751
Let me in!

15:18.817 --> 15:19.885
Let me in, damn it!

15:20.586 --> 15:21.520
Dama!

15:21.887 --> 15:23.923
Let go of me!

15:24.990 --> 15:27.726
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

15:27.793 --> 15:28.761
Let him go.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.830
-Let me in.
-Forget it.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.265
There are five forensic experts
in there.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.833
-We'll talk later.
-Please!

15:35.234 --> 15:36.969
I feel she was here.

15:37.903 --> 15:38.871
Let me in.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.372
Raul.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.907
Please, Dama.

15:44.543 --> 15:45.811
Let him in. I allow it.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.316
Thanks.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.627
Are you okay, Raul?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.931
This toy belongs to my daughter.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.201
Listen.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.370
There are lots of people
working in here.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.139
As soon as we find something,
I'll let you know.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.610
Have you had any news

17:58.677 --> 18:00.345
of the adoption gang?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.247
I told you,
you need to calm down.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.750
When we have something,
I'll let you know.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.030
Is it possible to know
who owns a car

18:18.097 --> 18:19.264
just with the plate number?

18:19.331 --> 18:21.033
Good morning, Maria Júlia.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.001
How are you?
Have you had breakfast?

18:23.068 --> 18:24.036
Did you sleep well?

18:24.703 --> 18:26.105
Good morning, Tai. I'm sorry.

18:27.739 --> 18:28.907
Okay, tell me the plate number.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.810
"L,

18:32.344 --> 18:33.312
M, N,

18:33.912 --> 18:35.314
two, 5, 0, 1."

18:35.380 --> 18:36.648
TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT

18:36.715 --> 18:39.418
Let's access
the DETRAN database quickly.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.854
I don't think they'd care.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.823
Done.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.292
-Already?
-Yes.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.564
Here it is. The company
is in Morumbi.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.032
Here's the address.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.168
Be careful.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.270
Thank you so much, Tai!

19:01.240 --> 19:02.674
I need this
tested for fingerprints.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.842
Okay. What case?

19:04.176 --> 19:05.210
It's a personal matter.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.313
Okay.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.716
Are you sure you want to pay
for this test?

19:11.316 --> 19:14.086
There's almost zero chance
of finding something.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.188
I don't care, Tai.
I will pay for it.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.456
Have it tested.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.490
Come.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.596
I love your store.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.465
Great location
in the downtown area.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.300
Candies.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.270
I'm thinking about investing
in your business

19:31.336 --> 19:33.071
so that I get to eat candies
every day.

19:33.138 --> 19:36.175
You need to have a lot of sugar
to invest in this.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.209
Do you?

19:37.910 --> 19:39.111
Yes, actually.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.479
I do.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.056
I could spend the day here
eating candies

19:51.123 --> 19:52.891
and talking to Edith.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.829
We've had access
to the police report.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.766
It seems he had a problem
with the brake system.

20:00.832 --> 20:01.800
-The brake system?
-Yes.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.403
It doesn't make sense.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.906
I have the brakes of the trucks
checked every week.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.842
It could have been a sabotage,
to steal the cargo maybe.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.144
We don't know yet.

20:13.679 --> 20:14.646
What about...

20:15.847 --> 20:17.716
Josley? I'm worried about him.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.319
We're working on that.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.622
Do you think
Josley could be involved

20:24.990 --> 20:26.024
in the sabotage?

20:27.626 --> 20:30.495
The gas station buys
may be involved in this.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.365
If we assume
Josley talked to Cynara,

20:34.166 --> 20:36.034
that mean she lied to us.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.402
Why would she lie?

20:37.469 --> 20:40.973
Because she doesn't want to say
she fell in love with a client?

20:41.039 --> 20:43.809
Or because she doesn't trust us?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.278
We can't blame her
for not trusting us.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.613
Who said he is a client?

20:47.679 --> 20:49.615
He could be a partner,
an accomplice.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.518
I see you have
opposing theories.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.954
Why don't you both go
and talk to Cynara?

20:56.021 --> 20:57.289
Find out who's right.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.258
The loser pays for the coffee.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.793
-I'd like a macchiato.
-An espresso for me.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.406
Go away!

21:16.875 --> 21:20.545
Hello. Excuse us.
We're looking for someone.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.214
Her name is Cynara.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.349
Forget about her, my love.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.118
Come with me.
You won't regret it.

21:27.019 --> 21:30.856
Does this handsome man
like chicks?

21:30.922 --> 21:32.090
No, it's not that.

21:32.157 --> 21:35.427
We're actually friends of hers.
We'd like to talk to her.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.664
You look like
you have transvestites friends.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.334
She's not working today.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.737
Maybe you don't realize,
but this is my job.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.206
If you stay here,
nobody's going to come.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.410
Maybe I should talk
to my police friends over there,

21:51.476 --> 21:55.013
ask them to check your bag
for drugs.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.349
You wouldn't lose two hours
of work.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.751
You'd lose at least two days.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.586
Hey, Waldir, calm.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.221
-Calm.
-You're not coppers.

22:03.288 --> 22:05.123
Do you want me to show you?

22:05.190 --> 22:06.625
-I'll go.
-Waldir!

22:06.692 --> 22:09.194
She was here last week,
needed a contact.

22:09.861 --> 22:10.962
I told her about Betão.

22:12.898 --> 22:13.865
Who is Betão?

22:14.499 --> 22:16.568
You need to give me something

22:16.635 --> 22:18.770
if you want me to tell you.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.806
Damn!

22:23.909 --> 22:27.045
Betão is a guy that works
at the mall down the road.

22:27.546 --> 22:28.513
And?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.683
She needed someone
to make her a new ID.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.352
I told her about him,
and she went.

22:35.053 --> 22:37.856
You won't say anything
about me telling you, right?

22:37.923 --> 22:39.524
Of course not.

22:39.591 --> 22:41.760
We didn't even have a talk.
Don't worry.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.629
Thank you.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.335
Copper? How dare she!

22:50.402 --> 22:52.170
Cop, barney, bull, swine.

22:52.738 --> 22:53.705
Do you need more synonyms?

22:54.439 --> 22:56.274
-That's enough, Waldir.
-Okay.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.443
Did you call that police car?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.912
I don't know them, dear.

23:01.346 --> 23:02.414
Maria Júlia, come on.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.316
-I had to pressure her.
-I get it.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.017
You know little
about the underworld.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.053
-But you'll learn.
-Go to hell, Waldir!

23:08.920 --> 23:10.288
What about Betão? Shall we go?

23:10.355 --> 23:11.923
Maybe she got a new ID

23:11.990 --> 23:14.793
because she wants to run away
and travel.

23:14.860 --> 23:17.529
Maybe she is
part of Josley's plan

23:18.597 --> 23:20.932
and is getting ready to run away
after the scam.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.033
Let's go see Betão.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.138
Cargo theft.

23:26.204 --> 23:29.107
I'm after a specialized gang.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.842
Great money movement.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.544
Just that?

23:33.311 --> 23:34.279
It's easy.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.618
What about
the other investigation?

23:40.852 --> 23:42.554
Of the adoption gang?

23:56.768 --> 23:58.937
I've arrested a guy.
Mauricio Costa.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.706
He's one of the agents.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.643
He confessed he's been part
of the group since 2004.

24:04.709 --> 24:05.944
Hold on.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.413
Since 2004? So, he could be...

24:08.480 --> 24:09.448
Yes.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.884
He could be involved
in Sofia's case.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.786
I promise you,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.155
I'll make that bastard talk.

24:19.758 --> 24:20.826
Can I see him?

24:23.361 --> 24:25.430
I need to see
that bastard's face.

24:38.376 --> 24:39.344
It's him.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.028
Satisfied?

25:01.700 --> 25:04.469
Open the door, Raul!
Open the damn door!

25:04.536 --> 25:06.204
You'll destroy me!
Open the door!

25:06.571 --> 25:07.739
Open it!

25:07.806 --> 25:10.108
She was five
when she disappeared.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.777
When she was kidnapped.
Do you remember?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.279
Help us, damn it!

25:14.346 --> 25:16.381
-I don't know. Are you insane?
-Do you remember her?

25:16.448 --> 25:17.616
Open the damn door!

25:19.718 --> 25:20.819
Open it!

25:20.886 --> 25:21.987
Were they sexually assaulted?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.155
Were they beaten? Damn it!

25:24.222 --> 25:25.590
By an employee, sometimes.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.699
You scoundrel!

25:35.634 --> 25:36.668
Stop him!

25:36.735 --> 25:38.737
I'm going to kill you, bastard!

25:38.803 --> 25:40.505
Get him out! Lock him out!

25:41.172 --> 25:42.140
Scoundrel!

25:42.440 --> 25:43.909
She is my daughter!

25:47.178 --> 25:48.146
Good afternoon.

25:52.317 --> 25:55.453
I need... My friend from Arouche

25:55.520 --> 25:56.855
told me that you...

25:57.589 --> 26:00.425
-ID!
-ID and license for 500.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.827
Passports are more expensive.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.030
Pay in cash in advance.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.668
-Do you have a photo?
-No, I don't.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.171
Follow me.

26:13.772 --> 26:14.739
Come on.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.948
This is a nice shop.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.716
Do you like it?

26:25.517 --> 26:26.484
I do.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.955
Relax, I'll take
a great photo of you.

26:30.021 --> 26:30.989
Look.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.562
Damn it! Will you excuse me?

26:39.064 --> 26:40.031
No worries.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.235
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:44.302 --> 26:46.037
Do you make passports here?

26:46.104 --> 26:48.406
I need one for my niece.

26:48.473 --> 26:51.276
She wants to go to Disney
and that.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.111
-See Donald Duck.
-Yes.

26:56.014 --> 26:56.982
Do you do it now?

26:58.149 --> 26:59.117
I do.

27:06.992 --> 27:10.328
Sit down. Still!
You sit down too.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.930
-Hold on.
-Sit down, man!

27:11.997 --> 27:12.964
Calm.

27:14.666 --> 27:15.900
We are going to talk now.

27:16.835 --> 27:20.739
I want to know who you are
and what you're doing here.

27:38.857 --> 27:39.824
Look at you!

27:42.127 --> 27:43.595
Damn it, for all these years,

27:43.662 --> 27:45.096
since you stopped being
a policeman,

27:45.163 --> 27:46.798
I have never said no to a favor.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.267
What you did for me,

27:49.334 --> 27:51.036
I know I will never be able
to make it up to you.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.671
But come on, brother!

27:53.672 --> 27:55.373
How do you expect
my subordinates to respect me

27:55.440 --> 27:56.408
after all this?

27:59.144 --> 28:00.111
I'm sorry, Dama.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.249
I shouldn't have asked you
to see that man.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.918
I should have known

28:06.985 --> 28:08.353
I wouldn't be able
to control myself.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.315
This is everything I got
on specialized cargo theft.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.355
Thank you.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.092
Thank you very much.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.060
Get out of here before I regret.

28:52.697 --> 28:53.665
Thanks.

28:56.835 --> 29:00.438
Hi. Get those men
some drinks, okay?

29:04.776 --> 29:06.211
-Hello, Tai.
-Tell me, Raul.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.279
Get the file on Nelson Chaves,

29:08.346 --> 29:10.515
related to cargo theft
here in São Paulo.

29:11.282 --> 29:13.485
Okay, is he Josley's partner?

29:13.551 --> 29:14.486
He could be.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.921
He may have made a deal
with Josley,

29:17.655 --> 29:20.125
bought fake IDs

29:20.191 --> 29:22.026
and then run away
after the failed theft.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.229
I get it. It makes sense.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.363
It's a hypothesis.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.931
We need to look further
into the matter.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.934
-Keep me posted, okay?
-Okay.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.009
You have reached the voicemail.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.812
Where are you, Waldir?

29:41.479 --> 29:44.048
I've been trying to reach
you and Maria Júlia for an hour.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.250
We need to talk.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.019
-Listen...
-Sit down!

29:48.086 --> 29:49.154
-Calm.
-Are you crazy?

29:49.220 --> 29:50.588
Put your gun down.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.357
If I get stressed out
and call security,

29:52.423 --> 29:53.758
you are both dead.

29:54.425 --> 29:58.296
Do you know the Chinese psycho
who owns this mall?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.532
Is your nickname Betão
because you're called Roberto?

30:00.598 --> 30:02.367
Go to hell, bitch.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.039
What is your gross
monthly income, Betão?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.875
You must pay a high rent
to the Chinese psycho

30:10.942 --> 30:12.210
for this shop.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.647
At best, you get enough money
to pay your bills

30:15.713 --> 30:17.982
and buy those fake shoes
you wear.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.388
Let me tell you something.
I'm not a police office.

30:24.789 --> 30:26.691
He isn't either.

30:27.859 --> 30:29.761
He has that face
because he was in the army.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.196
But that was 30 years ago.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.865
We need some information.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.534
Get me my bag, Waldir.

30:45.076 --> 30:46.044
Here you have 500.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.314
Do you think I'll speak for 500?

30:49.380 --> 30:50.348
Did you hear that?

30:50.615 --> 30:52.150
-Never!
-What about a thousand?

30:52.851 --> 30:55.053
But for that money,
I want to see all the photos.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.424
Who are they?

30:59.757 --> 31:02.093
Josley with a "Y."
Cynara with a "Y."

31:03.361 --> 31:07.432
Yes, are you sure
that is Nelson's address?

31:08.066 --> 31:09.167
That's what the file says.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.402
-There's nothing in there?
-Yes, there is.

31:12.904 --> 31:13.872
We will see.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.142
I'll get straight to the point.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.313
I need to know if a guest
was here last night.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.150
I give you the name,
and you check on your computer.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.786
I leave 50 reals on the counter,

31:28.853 --> 31:30.488
and we never see
each other again.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.064
-What's their name?
-Nelson Chaves.

31:44.102 --> 31:45.937
He was here five weeks ago.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.006
He never came back?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.575
I don't know all the guests.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.277
We don't ask them any questions.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.212
That's the boss's policy.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.348
What about Josley?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.229
With a "Y" or an "I"?

32:11.596 --> 32:12.563
"Y."

32:15.867 --> 32:17.535
Josley Suares.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.939
He was checked in for one night.

32:24.642 --> 32:27.145
Answer the phone, Waldir!
Where are you?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.685
Check the other one. That one.
I'm sorry.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.320
I got a message from Raul.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.093
-Where the hell are you?
-Hi, Raul.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.697
I'm sorry.
Something has come up.

32:46.531 --> 32:47.999
What happened?

32:48.066 --> 32:49.634
Did you get to talk
to the ID man?

32:50.335 --> 32:51.436
Yes, kind of.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.539
-Was Josley there?
-No, neither him nor Cynara.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.207
Where are you?

32:56.741 --> 32:58.676
At a beautiful motel.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.745
You should see it.
Josley was here.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.413
-He was?
-Yes.

33:03.247 --> 33:04.816
I'm trying to find out more.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.718
One more thing.

33:07.585 --> 33:08.886
Maria Júlia

33:09.887 --> 33:11.723
had to do

33:12.290 --> 33:13.758
an investment for "Ausentes."

33:14.125 --> 33:17.895
She spent a thousand reals
for no information at all.

33:18.363 --> 33:19.330
A thousand reals?

33:19.797 --> 33:21.032
Are you insane?

33:21.799 --> 33:22.800
What the hell?

33:25.570 --> 33:27.438
Raul is very happy
for having you

33:27.505 --> 33:28.873
in "Ausentes."

33:30.742 --> 33:33.044
-Let's go.
-Can I check something?

33:33.111 --> 33:34.078
Yes.

33:36.748 --> 33:37.815
It's all yours.

33:37.882 --> 33:40.218
Can we get some coffee at least?

33:40.284 --> 33:41.686
Damn it!

33:41.753 --> 33:44.055
This has been the hardest job
ever in my life.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.189
Damn!

33:45.256 --> 33:47.191
-Was that a yes or a no?
-You are shameless.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.259
You really are.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.130
Wow!

33:53.231 --> 33:55.299
-Isn't that...?
-Sharon.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.202
The lady that sent us here.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.204
Why did she send us here

34:00.271 --> 34:02.073
if she knew
we would find out about her?

34:02.673 --> 34:05.043
I guess she never imagined
Betão would speak.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.844
Or show us the footage.

34:07.445 --> 34:09.447
Trusting Betão
is not a smart thing to do.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.282
It's not, but now we know

34:12.016 --> 34:14.585
that Sharon is somehow
involved in this.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.591
But you've just told me
he was here yesterday.

34:20.658 --> 34:23.194
I didn't say he spent the night.
I said he was checked in.

34:23.261 --> 34:25.863
A transvestite checked him in.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.331
Was it her?

34:28.433 --> 34:30.268
She came and did the check-in,
but she didn't stay.

34:30.334 --> 34:32.503
She left right after that.
A car was waiting for her.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.639
-What car?
-A blue ugly car.

35:29.827 --> 35:30.928
Do you like cars?

35:31.996 --> 35:35.199
Yes, but I was actually
looking for a friend.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.768
Do you know his name?
I know them all.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.370
Waldir.

35:39.904 --> 35:40.872
Waldir?

35:41.205 --> 35:42.173
That's right.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.208
There's no Waldir here.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.711
He must have sent me
the wrong address.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.113
Would you like a cigarette?

36:08.633 --> 36:12.003
Thanks for the cigarette.
I'll try to find him.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.309
The same guy
that was at the apartment

36:18.376 --> 36:19.977
was at the car rental agency.

36:20.044 --> 36:22.713
Let me look into his life.
I'll tell you what I find out.

36:22.780 --> 36:23.848
Okay.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.583
Tai, you are the best.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.490
We need to find out

36:33.191 --> 36:35.893
who created the lie
about fake IDs

36:35.960 --> 36:36.928
and the motel.

36:37.962 --> 36:39.897
Who is trying to deceive us?

36:40.998 --> 36:42.667
The girl in Amaral Gurgel?

36:42.733 --> 36:44.969
No. Nelson wouldn't use
two amateurs.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.471
Josley is an amateur already.

36:48.306 --> 36:50.274
What if it was the guy

36:50.341 --> 36:51.709
that dropped Cynara
at the motel?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.612
He could be behind this big lie.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.547
That could have been Josley.

36:56.614 --> 36:59.483
Josley doesn't have enough money
to buy a car like that.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.653
We've seen the place
where he lives.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.523
What if someone is trying
to make us believe that Josley

37:05.590 --> 37:08.025
bought fake IDs,
stayed at the motel

37:08.526 --> 37:10.194
and ran away after the theft?

37:10.261 --> 37:11.963
Who would do something
like that?

37:14.131 --> 37:17.201
Look for Cynara and Sharon.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.503
Don't come until you find them.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.538
Come on!

37:24.141 --> 37:25.843
Hi, handsome! You're back!

37:26.277 --> 37:27.545
What would you like today?

37:28.913 --> 37:29.880
Get out of here!

37:40.258 --> 37:41.225
Hello, princess!

37:43.728 --> 37:45.730
What's going on?
Are you here to kill me?

37:45.796 --> 37:47.698
No, we just want to talk.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.800
I don't have anything else
to say.

37:49.867 --> 37:50.901
Yes, you do.

37:50.968 --> 37:53.004
Last time, you didn't give us
accurate information.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.505
You lied to us,
didn't you, Sharon?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.675
If you tell us the truth now,
we may understand each other.

37:57.742 --> 37:58.776
I'll go buy some cigarettes.

38:00.044 --> 38:02.246
You wouldn't want to ruin
this true friendship, right?

38:04.348 --> 38:06.951
You're completely lost.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.688
I just hope you find Cynara
before it's too late.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.123
Why do you say that, Sharon?

38:12.623 --> 38:15.026
Before she dies from smoking
too much crack cocaine.

38:15.092 --> 38:18.596
After what happened,
she lost herself again.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.398
Now she is in that rathole.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.602
Working in the street,
we're used to that craziness.

38:24.669 --> 38:28.239
But talking about fake IDs
and escaping.

38:28.572 --> 38:31.075
The worst thing is that the guy
that was going to pay her

38:31.142 --> 38:32.209
disappeared.

38:32.276 --> 38:35.379
Hold on. Who owes her what?

38:35.446 --> 38:38.349
Who is planning something?
Let's clear this up.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.284
Explain it to us, Sharon.

38:57.635 --> 38:58.602
Cynara!

39:00.671 --> 39:01.639
Cynara!

39:04.508 --> 39:07.678
We found out
Josley made a scape plan.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.648
-Did he get to scape?
-I don't know.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.884
My team is in the street
looking further into the matter.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.587
Yes, but did he do it
on his own?

39:16.654 --> 39:17.722
No.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.691
He made a deal

39:20.758 --> 39:24.362
with a specialized cargo theft
gang from São Paulo.

39:24.829 --> 39:25.796
Damn it, Raul.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.533
But the cargo is not missing.
It's all there.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.802
Something must have gone wrong.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.606
Maybe there was a sabotage.
I don't know.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.174
I see.

39:37.908 --> 39:41.679
Please, send your report

39:42.546 --> 39:44.448
to Celso,
the insurance company guy.

39:44.515 --> 39:46.450
He needs it to close the case.

39:46.817 --> 39:50.087
Without it, I won't get
my compensation payout.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.489
Okay. Good.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.259
This is a big place.

39:55.326 --> 39:58.429
You have few employees
for such a big place.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.231
Because of the crisis.
These are hard times.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.932
Such valuable cargo.

40:07.538 --> 40:10.174
845.350 OUNCES OF SULFURIC ACID
COST 300.000 REALS

40:11.475 --> 40:13.677
Is there any parking lot here

40:13.744 --> 40:16.180
where employees park their cars?

40:17.681 --> 40:18.649
Yes.

40:19.483 --> 40:20.451
-At the back.
-Over there?

40:21.285 --> 40:22.253
May I?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.221
-Yes.
-I just want to check.

40:30.394 --> 40:31.862
There are three options.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.332
Josley left you
and ran away with the money.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.470
They killed him
and try to blame him.

40:40.104 --> 40:44.008
Or the lady is an accomplice
and is lying to us.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.877
I don't like my role
in any of those situations.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.679
If you are going to play
tough...

40:48.746 --> 40:50.714
-Calm down, Waldir.
-What is going on?

40:50.781 --> 40:52.116
Calm!

40:53.617 --> 40:54.552
Okay, go on.

40:56.654 --> 40:57.621
Cynara?

40:58.088 --> 40:59.990
You're still under the effects
of crack cocaine.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.827
But the withdrawal
is going to be painful tomorrow.

41:03.427 --> 41:05.963
We'll find a place
for your rehabilitation, okay?

41:06.764 --> 41:09.733
I promise, but you need
to help us now.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.072
I can't be saved.

41:17.608 --> 41:18.576
What I did...

41:20.277 --> 41:22.046
He was the love of my life.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.549
He loved me so much,
I know that!

41:28.786 --> 41:30.020
We were going to run away.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.926
We had it all planned out.
We would buy a house.

41:38.963 --> 41:39.930
But he's dead now.

41:42.266 --> 41:43.400
I know who did it.

41:44.568 --> 41:45.769
That bastard...

41:46.403 --> 41:48.339
was going to pay me to lie.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.241
I didn't have any option.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.211
That man told me,

41:54.845 --> 41:56.914
if I didn't do as he said,
I would end up like Jô.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.986
Tell me! What would you
have done?

42:02.586 --> 42:03.554
Who's the man?

42:05.322 --> 42:06.290
Tell me his name.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.092
Say it.

42:08.158 --> 42:09.960
-His name!
-Say it.

42:10.895 --> 42:11.862
I don't know.

42:15.466 --> 42:16.901
But I remember his car.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.271
It was blue.

42:23.007 --> 42:24.241
Light blue.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.701
One of my men

42:50.768 --> 42:53.404
saw the man and the girl
that work for you

42:53.470 --> 42:55.372
talking to transvestites
in Amaral Gurgel.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.207
-What do we do now?
-What are you doing?

42:57.274 --> 42:59.510
You were supposed
to close the investigation

43:00.010 --> 43:01.345
with Josley gone missing.

43:01.879 --> 43:05.049
You would take your part.
I would take mine.

43:05.115 --> 43:08.385
But you had to play hero!

43:08.452 --> 43:09.987
You sabotaged the brakes, right?

43:11.055 --> 43:12.356
Tell me how terrified you were

43:12.423 --> 43:14.525
when you realized
Josley had died.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.828
Melting your employee
in sulfuric acid?

43:17.895 --> 43:19.563
You can get many years
in prison for that.

43:19.630 --> 43:20.598
Many years!

43:20.998 --> 43:22.466
You gave money
to the transvestites

43:22.533 --> 43:25.069
for them to buy fake IDs
and check in at the motel.

43:25.869 --> 43:28.472
And then you come to me
to get the insurance money?

43:28.539 --> 43:30.107
Did you really think
I would buy all that?

43:34.445 --> 43:35.412
No!

43:35.846 --> 43:39.350
Come here, bastard!
You have to pay my fees first.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.251
Just pray you have
10 thousand here.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.921
You'd better pray
because I don't accept checks!

43:43.988 --> 43:46.724
And I want a thousand more
for insalubrity.

43:46.790 --> 43:49.693
Let's go
and talk to your employees.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.828
Come on.

43:50.894 --> 43:53.597
Hey! You can all go home.

43:54.131 --> 43:57.568
The boss is going to pay you
and close the business, right?

44:00.337 --> 44:01.405
Right?

44:01.472 --> 44:02.539
Yes.

44:02.606 --> 44:03.807
He's going to close
the business.

44:11.582 --> 44:12.549
Unbelievable.

44:13.550 --> 44:15.786
Why are you giving this to me?

44:15.853 --> 44:17.788
I don't like
insurance companies,

44:17.855 --> 44:19.223
but I won't let Hélio

44:19.289 --> 44:20.691
get away with this
and get the money.

44:22.626 --> 44:24.061
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

44:26.563 --> 44:28.232
See you.

44:46.717 --> 44:48.018
The laboratory people said

44:48.085 --> 44:50.120
it's impossible
to find fingerprints

44:50.187 --> 44:51.388
after so long.

44:52.256 --> 44:54.725
They didn't even take
the toy with them.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.609
Look what I brought you.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.451
What's its name?

45:20.517 --> 45:21.885
What are you going to name it?
