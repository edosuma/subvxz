WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:03.080
Previously on Broadchurch.

00:05.208 --> 00:08.718
Cause of death was asphyxiation.
He was strangled.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.535
Forensics from the hut.

00:10.536 --> 00:13.847
Boot print in the mud up the hill
matches one they found inside.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.568
It's a man's size ten.

00:15.864 --> 00:20.471
Danny's life touched many people and
we'll be looking at all those connections.

00:20.472 --> 00:23.852
If you or someone you know
has any information,

00:23.928 --> 00:25.918
has noticed anything unusual,

00:26.088 --> 00:27.778
please come forward now.

00:28.392 --> 00:31.362
I'd urge everyone, don't hide
anything...

00:31.416 --> 00:33.216
because we will find out.

00:34.152 --> 00:37.607
If a member of your family,
or a friend, or a neighbour,

00:37.608 --> 00:41.063
has been behaving differently
in the past days or weeks,

00:41.064 --> 00:43.464
please tell the police immediately.

00:43.656 --> 00:46.823
There will be no hiding place for
Danny's killer.

00:46.824 --> 00:49.034
We will catch whoever did this.

01:35.064 --> 01:35.464
In...

01:36.792 --> 01:37.422
and out.

01:40.104 --> 01:43.559
Office to be cleared by the end of
the day, please.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.719
I think I know who the killer is.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.920
Well, don't walk away from me.

01:50.184 --> 01:50.584
Alec!

02:00.264 --> 02:00.954
Dad, out!

02:01.992 --> 02:03.852
Mate, where's your laptop?

02:04.296 --> 02:04.636
Why?

02:05.448 --> 02:07.898
Mum needs it for the investigation.

02:08.616 --> 02:11.106
It's not here.
Well, where is it?

02:12.216 --> 02:13.366
Um...I lost it.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.490
Well, when did you lose it?

02:17.112 --> 02:18.912
A week back.Maybe longer.

02:21.144 --> 02:22.727
Why didn't you tell us?

02:22.728 --> 02:25.798
Well, you've both had a lot on your
mind.

02:27.336 --> 02:28.946
Don't lie to me, Tom.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.750
Where's the computer?

02:38.136 --> 02:41.506
Oh, my little baby sis, you never
let me down.

02:42.744 --> 02:45.194
You know this will sort everything.

02:47.064 --> 02:49.151
We're running out of time.
My boss is on his way out

02:49.152 --> 02:51.239
and I'm scared another
child will get hurt.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.440
You just tell me what you saw.

02:57.576 --> 03:00.311
The night of Danny's death, I was
up...

03:00.312 --> 03:03.335
I was looking out the window,
down the road,

03:03.336 --> 03:05.766
and I saw a man in the distance -

03:05.928 --> 03:07.208
dark clothes, hat.

03:09.384 --> 03:11.975
He was shoving a bag into someone's
bin.

03:11.976 --> 03:14.423
The bag looked like it had clothes
in it.

03:14.424 --> 03:17.447
Your sister? Why's she just coming
forward with this now?

03:17.448 --> 03:19.958
I think something jogged her memory.

03:20.328 --> 03:23.495
Did you find your boy's computer?
He said it had been stolen.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.006
You believe him?
No.

03:28.248 --> 03:30.263
I called them, asked them to come in.

03:30.264 --> 03:32.711
Today? Without telling me?
I'm telling you now.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.583
How's the surveillance going?

03:34.584 --> 03:37.607
Susan Wright's caravan is completely
empty.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.767
All cleared out. No sign of her or
the dog.

03:39.768 --> 03:41.218
She's just vanished?

03:42.216 --> 03:44.786
Our key witness has just disappeared?

03:46.104 --> 03:46.564
Great.

03:47.976 --> 03:49.776
So where is Nigel Carter?

03:51.288 --> 03:54.788
Surveillance team lost him.
What? So where is he?

03:54.888 --> 03:57.479
They don't know.
He shook them off in a back alley.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.511
Oh, what is the matter with you
people? He's a major suspect.

04:01.512 --> 04:06.012
Get uniform, scour the area, bring
him here now! You understand?

04:07.704 --> 04:08.794
Mum...it's me.

04:12.168 --> 04:16.058
When you get this message,
I don't want you to worry.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.087
People are gonna say things.
I don't want you to listen to them.

04:20.088 --> 04:22.518
I don't want you to believe them.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.590
Things are just a bit mixed up,
that's all.

04:27.576 --> 04:28.956
I'll be home soon.

04:29.304 --> 04:31.224
So you look after yourself.

04:52.488 --> 04:54.878
My computer got nicked, at school.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.140
I left it in a bag and then it was
gone.

04:58.824 --> 05:01.254
Yeah. You mustn't lie to me, Tom.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.383
Paul Coates said you threatened to
accuse him of all sorts of shenanigans

05:15.384 --> 05:17.399
if he was to give this over to us.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.240
You threatened the vicar?
Why'd you smash it up, Tom?

05:24.888 --> 05:27.378
It had my emails with Danny on it.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.500
And are these your emails?

05:32.664 --> 05:36.119
How did you get those?
They were stored on your server.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.703
I haven't seen these before.

05:37.704 --> 05:42.311
Danny was using a different address
to the one on his home computer.

05:42.312 --> 05:45.623
You're the only person he wrote to
from this address.

05:45.624 --> 05:48.524
No, no. I see you and one other
person.

05:50.376 --> 05:52.535
I think he sent them from his phone.

05:52.536 --> 05:54.407
Where'd he get his phone from?

05:54.408 --> 05:57.428
He said he saved up from his paper
round.

05:58.584 --> 06:01.463
Why didn't you mention
that you and Danny fell out?

06:01.464 --> 06:03.384
I thought you already knew.

06:04.344 --> 06:08.534
In these emails, Danny's asking you
to stay away from him.

06:08.952 --> 06:15.112
Says he doesn't want to see you any more
and you're no longer friends. Why was that?

06:15.144 --> 06:17.344
He said he found a new friend.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.580
Someone who understood him better
than me.

06:22.056 --> 06:23.566
You write to Danny...

06:27.096 --> 06:28.776
'I wish you were dead.'

06:31.416 --> 06:34.295
He replies, 'Wishing won't make it
happen.'

06:34.296 --> 06:37.175
You email back, 'I could kill you if
I wanted.'

06:37.176 --> 06:40.343
Oh, for God's sake, it's just kids,
just boys falling out.

06:40.344 --> 06:42.503
Did you kill Danny, Tom?
Come on!

06:42.504 --> 06:45.344
I'm talking to your son, Joe, not
you.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.120
No.

06:50.136 --> 06:53.303
If you're lying to me, Tom, there'll
be very serious consequences.

06:53.304 --> 06:56.039
If you want to tell me you were
involved in Danny's death...

06:56.040 --> 06:57.080
That's enough.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.223
You want to question him like that,
we need a solicitor.

07:01.224 --> 07:03.074
Fine. We're done for now.

07:03.528 --> 07:06.368
We need a DNA sample.
Then you can go.

07:06.408 --> 07:09.258
Oh, Tom... What is your shoe size,
Tom?

07:10.728 --> 07:11.298
A five.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.050
What about you, Joe?

07:14.904 --> 07:15.594
Er...ten.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.390
All right.

07:40.536 --> 07:41.926
What are you doing?

07:43.704 --> 07:46.151
What are we gonna do about the room?

07:46.152 --> 07:47.362
How do you mean?

07:48.312 --> 07:50.052
Baby. The baby's coming.

07:51.336 --> 07:53.886
It means we have to clear the room.

07:54.936 --> 07:57.246
I don't want to clear the room.

08:01.128 --> 08:03.431
Sir, why'd you call me all the way
down here?

08:03.432 --> 08:04.642
What's going on?

08:06.168 --> 08:07.498
I was here before.

08:08.328 --> 08:09.368
On this beach.

08:11.064 --> 08:12.674
I came here as a kid.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.679
With a tent. Some campsite near the
cliff.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.700
I tried looking for it when I first
came.

08:19.848 --> 08:22.298
You came on holiday to Broadchurch?

08:28.056 --> 08:32.951
Didn't remember I was here till the
day I arrived. It freaked me out.

08:32.952 --> 08:35.172
Those bloody cliffs still there.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.500
Still the same.

08:37.559 --> 08:42.039
I used to sit under them
and get away from my parents arguing.

08:42.312 --> 08:45.342
They kept bickering till the day Mum
died.

08:45.912 --> 08:47.639
Last thing she ever said to me -

08:47.640 --> 08:52.391
'God will put you in the right place
even if you don't know it at the time.'

08:52.392 --> 08:55.482
What are you saying that for?

08:58.872 --> 08:59.332
Hello?

09:03.624 --> 09:05.927
Danny's phone is on.
They're tracing the signal.

09:05.928 --> 09:10.247
The killer must have switched it on.
They can track the signal.

09:10.248 --> 09:13.415
Get back and question Nigel Carter.
Get the truth out of him.

09:13.416 --> 09:17.591
This is Hardy. Will you send the tracking
signal coordinates to my phone? Good.

09:17.592 --> 09:17.872
OK.

09:19.464 --> 09:20.614
Go, on. Go. Go.

09:27.816 --> 09:28.456
Miller...

09:33.144 --> 09:36.164
You've done good work on this. Well
done.

09:56.184 --> 09:58.454
Yeah, just... Just pull up here.

10:02.664 --> 10:04.514
Stay here. I'll call you.

13:43.272 --> 13:44.712
I'm sick of hiding.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.399
I know I said tonight was the last time,
but we're not doing anything wrong.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.000
I'm not going to meet you any more.

14:33.576 --> 14:34.846
Oh, come on, Dan.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.470
Try and stop me. I'll tell Dad.

14:37.608 --> 14:39.479
No, no, no. Let's not be silly.

14:39.480 --> 14:39.760
OK?

14:44.088 --> 14:46.588
I mean, what would you say, anyway?

14:47.112 --> 14:49.192
We meet up and hug. So what?

14:49.560 --> 14:52.439
You tell your dad and...he won't
understand.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.183
You tell people what we've been doing,
they won't understand. No-one will.

14:56.184 --> 15:00.114
They'll say it's wrong and it's sick
- and it's not.

15:00.648 --> 15:04.247
It'll ruin everything. The whole of
our world. The whole of our lives.

15:04.248 --> 15:05.798
And it'll be on you.

15:07.272 --> 15:08.892
Is that what you want?

15:10.296 --> 15:10.576
No.

15:13.032 --> 15:13.312
No.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.960
Of course not.

15:20.664 --> 15:21.534
Shit. Danny!

15:22.392 --> 15:22.852
Danny!

15:24.984 --> 15:25.264
Ow!

15:26.424 --> 15:28.864
Danny!
Get away from me! Go away!

15:31.464 --> 15:33.264
Whoa! What are you doing?

15:33.480 --> 15:37.370
We shouldn't have ever done this.
I... I... I'm sorry

15:37.944 --> 15:41.264
All right? I shouldn't have said
those things.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.128
Let's go back together.

15:49.176 --> 15:50.686
All right? All right?

15:51.768 --> 15:52.518
Come here.

15:59.688 --> 16:01.078
What are you doing?

16:01.992 --> 16:04.727
Promise this'll stay between us,
then you can leave.

16:04.728 --> 16:06.708
Or what?
Just promise, Dan!

16:07.608 --> 16:09.748
I know what you want from me.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.943
I don't want anything.You do, and
you're too afraid to ask!

16:13.944 --> 16:15.527
Do not say those things, Dan.

16:15.528 --> 16:18.308
Why don't you do them to Tom
instead?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.380
I am not that man!

16:24.456 --> 16:26.546
Let go.
I never touched you!

16:26.904 --> 16:29.927
I never touched Tom and I never will!
Do you understand?

16:29.928 --> 16:32.598
You do not say those things about me.

16:32.808 --> 16:35.648
I helped you...and you won't spoil
it.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.196
You do not spoil it!

16:48.648 --> 16:48.988
Dan?

16:55.416 --> 16:55.756
Dan.

18:44.136 --> 18:45.836
Shit! Shit.

19:01.560 --> 19:05.110
Here you go, mister. Back to the
real world.Yeah.

19:06.024 --> 19:07.874
Tonight was a lot of fun.

19:07.984 --> 19:10.534
Yeah.
I had more than a good time.

19:11.152 --> 19:11.552
Good.

21:10.920 --> 21:15.010
What was the exact nature
of your relationship with Danny?

21:16.824 --> 21:18.554
I was in love with him.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.450
When did this start?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.730
About nine months ago.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.790
Mark gave Danny a split lip.

21:30.648 --> 21:33.258
Danny came round to ours to see Tom.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.127
Didn't know where else to go.
I fixed him up.

21:37.128 --> 21:37.878
We talked.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.630
And then what happened?

21:41.016 --> 21:43.446
He'd come round to play with Tom.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.495
He'd always come and find me.
We'd have a chat.

21:47.496 --> 21:51.146
He told me he couldn't talk to his
dad like that.

21:53.544 --> 21:55.464
That's...when we started...

21:56.568 --> 21:58.151
meeting, just the two of us.

21:58.152 --> 22:00.062
Did you tell Ellie or Tom?

22:04.056 --> 22:04.686
Why not?

22:05.640 --> 22:07.970
I wanted something that was mine.

22:08.808 --> 22:10.138
Ellie has her job.

22:10.824 --> 22:12.624
Tom...does his own thing.

22:15.144 --> 22:16.014
But Danny...

22:19.464 --> 22:21.314
I felt like he needed me.

22:24.504 --> 22:26.714
Where did Ellie think you were?

22:27.528 --> 22:29.048
Running. Cycling. Pub.

22:30.984 --> 22:33.364
So you lied about where you were?

22:35.304 --> 22:36.984
Did you ever touch him?

22:37.608 --> 22:37.888
No.

22:43.512 --> 22:45.192
All I ever asked for...

22:50.568 --> 22:52.418
..was for him to hold me.

22:52.728 --> 22:54.538
Standing up? Sitting down?

22:55.752 --> 22:56.612
In a chair.

22:57.768 --> 22:58.818
Clothed? Naked?

23:00.648 --> 23:01.228
Clothed.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.610
How long would the hugs last?

23:05.256 --> 23:09.576
Why does it matter?Everything
matters. I need the facts, Joe.

23:10.872 --> 23:12.382
I need to understand.

23:13.608 --> 23:16.628
If I can't understand it, why should
you?

23:19.800 --> 23:21.959
Did you ever give Danny presents?

23:21.960 --> 23:23.420
Mobile phone.

23:25.416 --> 23:28.439
Beginning of the year.
Told him not to show Mark and Beth.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.700
Did you ever give him any cash?

23:30.888 --> 23:31.348
ã500.

23:34.056 --> 23:36.791
It was part of our spending money
for Florida.

23:36.792 --> 23:40.922
Why did you need to give Danny
that amount of money, Joe?

23:42.984 --> 23:44.774
I wanted him to love me.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.903
Two nights ago, why did you call from
the hut?

23:50.904 --> 23:52.754
I couldn't take any more.

23:57.384 --> 23:59.294
I caused Jack's death too.

23:59.832 --> 24:02.032
I knew you'd check the number.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.180
I wanted it just to be you. To
confess.

24:05.304 --> 24:07.044
Then I saw Ellie...so...

24:10.488 --> 24:11.118
..I ran.

24:14.088 --> 24:15.248
Does Ellie know?

24:16.104 --> 24:16.384
No.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.180
Ohh...

24:32.088 --> 24:34.103
I dunno. Why don't you ask her?

24:34.104 --> 24:36.695
Do you mind?
For the sake of the tape, DI Hardy...

24:36.696 --> 24:38.856
Interview terminated at 1:33pm.

24:40.008 --> 24:41.398
Take him.
Come on.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.234
He's my suspect!

24:44.472 --> 24:46.802
Sorry, Miller.
What is going on?

24:52.248 --> 24:53.278
It's not him.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.330
How do you know?

24:56.856 --> 24:59.576
I need to ask you a couple of things.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.400
Where were you the night of Danny's
death?

25:04.488 --> 25:04.888
What?

25:05.928 --> 25:07.655
Just... Please. I'll explain.

25:07.656 --> 25:10.796
But we just... We need to keep this
simple.

25:10.968 --> 25:14.398
So I'll ask questions.
You give me the answers.

25:14.424 --> 25:17.015
What, you think it was me?
Where were you?

25:17.016 --> 25:19.236
Are you serious?
Please, Ellie.

25:20.328 --> 25:21.828
Don't call me Ellie.

25:22.920 --> 25:27.000
Tell me where you were
the night that Danny Latimer died.

25:27.672 --> 25:28.762
I was at home.

25:29.976 --> 25:33.066
We just got back from Florida that
morning.

25:33.288 --> 25:34.448
So that night...

25:36.024 --> 25:37.234
What did you do?

25:38.040 --> 25:40.370
Unpack? Get ready for work? What?

25:41.496 --> 25:42.586
I went to bed.

25:43.800 --> 25:48.839
I get terrible jet lag, so I have these
pills I take and they knock me out.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.920
What time did you go to bed?

25:51.864 --> 25:55.184
Half seven, eight. Why are you
asking me this?

25:57.192 --> 25:59.452
Did you notice Joe come to bed?

26:02.376 --> 26:02.656
No.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.912
OK. Tell me what's going on.

26:11.448 --> 26:15.118
What are you doing?
Why are you coming around here?

26:21.816 --> 26:22.676
It was Joe.

26:27.432 --> 26:29.182
Joe killed Danny Latimer.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.650
No. What the fuck?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.290
No, he didn't.

26:37.224 --> 26:38.024
He didn't.

26:39.384 --> 26:41.064
We have him in custody.

26:53.784 --> 26:54.244
Sorry.

26:55.512 --> 26:56.192
It's OK.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.110
It's all right.

27:03.288 --> 27:03.918
No. S...

27:05.016 --> 27:05.946
Susan Wright.

27:07.176 --> 27:08.759
She saw Nige. My sister...

27:08.760 --> 27:10.380
No, they saw Joe.
No.

27:11.352 --> 27:15.092
Same build, facial similarities,
bald head and a hat.

27:16.248 --> 27:19.448
They thought they saw Nige but they
saw Joe.

27:21.288 --> 27:23.648
No, it's not Joe. It's not Joe.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.206
It's not Joe.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.280
Please.

27:34.392 --> 27:35.372
You're wrong.

27:37.992 --> 27:38.672
I'm not.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.004
I want to see him.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.020
I want to see him.

27:51.816 --> 27:53.196
I want to see him.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.300
Are you sure?

28:05.640 --> 28:08.360
You're not right.
I want to see him.

28:24.216 --> 28:25.716
You don't touch him.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.831
You don't do anything
that might jeopardise a conviction.

28:29.832 --> 28:35.132
What am I gonna do? He's bigger than
me and there are cameras everywhere.

28:39.624 --> 28:40.024
El...

28:41.928 --> 28:42.618
Sit down.

28:47.256 --> 28:48.116
Is it true?

28:49.704 --> 28:51.854
I never touched...Tom or Fred.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.420
I never touched Danny. El...

28:55.176 --> 28:57.666
I've always loved you.
He was 11!

28:59.496 --> 29:00.936
I can't explain it.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.960
Can I see Tom?
No!

29:04.968 --> 29:05.248
No!

29:07.128 --> 29:08.868
You sorry piece of shit!

29:10.728 --> 29:11.648
Get off him!

29:13.752 --> 29:17.242
All right, all right, all right.
Get her out.No!

29:17.352 --> 29:17.632
No!

29:20.520 --> 29:20.800
No!

29:29.298 --> 29:32.897
We booked you a family room
at the hotel on the roundabout.

29:32.898 --> 29:37.937
Pete will meet you there with Tom and Fred.
You can pick some stuff up on the way.

29:37.938 --> 29:40.961
Don't talk to anyone.
Shut the curtains. Lock the door.

29:40.962 --> 29:44.442
Don't answer the phone
to anyone that isn't me.

29:44.562 --> 29:47.873
If you need me to do anything on the
paperwork or stuff I've been following up,

29:47.874 --> 29:49.194
my desk's a mess.

29:50.610 --> 29:52.700
Tell me this isn't happening.

29:54.642 --> 29:56.262
Is this my car?
Yeah.

29:56.802 --> 29:57.672
Thanks, Dom.

30:00.546 --> 30:01.926
I'll see you soon.

31:18.738 --> 31:22.049
I've come to pick up some clothes,
toys for the kids, that sort of stuff.

31:22.050 --> 31:25.793
I'll have to accompany you around
while you pick up your things.

31:25.794 --> 31:27.294
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

32:19.506 --> 32:20.896
We were happy here.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.200
Hello?
It's DI Hardy. Broadchurch.

32:36.918 --> 32:40.949
You, mate, are a bastard. You gave
the Sandbrook story to Olly.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.330
We've got Danny Latimer's killer.

32:43.686 --> 32:46.709
Who is it?I'll be making
a statement in three hours.

32:46.710 --> 32:48.293
No-one else has advance warning.

32:48.294 --> 32:51.029
If you're down here, you'll have
first access.

32:51.030 --> 32:51.550
Thanks.

32:52.902 --> 32:55.452
But why'd you call me?

32:55.926 --> 32:58.066
At 5pm, I'll tell the family.

32:59.238 --> 33:02.608
I'll then make a short statement to
the media.

33:02.694 --> 33:04.997
And then we all need to be on hand

33:04.998 --> 33:09.317
because this information is gonna run
a crack through this community.

33:09.318 --> 33:10.998
You all know DS Miller.

33:11.766 --> 33:14.206
She has been removed from the case

33:14.502 --> 33:16.762
and put on leave with full pay.

33:17.958 --> 33:21.398
There is no suggestion that she knew.
All right?

33:21.558 --> 33:25.238
There is no suggestion
that she covered anything up.

33:27.030 --> 33:31.637
You're her colleagues and her
friends. This is unthinkable for her.

33:31.638 --> 33:33.941
She'll need you. She'll need all of
us.

33:33.942 --> 33:34.922
This is nice.

33:39.126 --> 33:40.636
This is an adventure.

33:42.726 --> 33:45.226
Are you hungry? We could get chips.

33:45.318 --> 33:48.629
We could sit on the bed, watch
telly, eat chips out of the packet.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.430
Tell me what's happening.

34:14.694 --> 34:16.996
Mark, do you have a minute?
Course I do.

34:16.998 --> 34:18.628
Beth? Come in.
Thanks.

34:19.446 --> 34:21.426
Just go through.
Thank you.

34:23.766 --> 34:24.926
Hi, Beth.
Hiya.

34:25.350 --> 34:25.630
Hi.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.484
Um, maybe we could all take a seat.

34:29.670 --> 34:29.949
OK.

34:46.949 --> 34:49.109
We have charged someone
with Danny's murder.

34:49.110 --> 34:51.360
Oh, God. I don't want to know.

34:52.277 --> 34:53.197
That's good.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.914
Is it someone we know?

34:58.470 --> 34:59.680
It's Joe Miller.

35:03.798 --> 35:04.658
Oh, my God.

35:07.542 --> 35:08.802
No, it can't be.

35:10.278 --> 35:12.548
They only live across the field.

35:13.446 --> 35:18.166
He and Danny had been...meeting in
secret for the last few months.

35:19.782 --> 35:21.365
We can't tell you much more,

35:21.366 --> 35:24.856
but we do believe
that we have the right person.

35:25.254 --> 35:26.474
What about Ellie?

35:27.846 --> 35:29.056
She didn't know.

35:33.606 --> 35:34.006
Mark?

35:36.198 --> 35:36.598
Mark?

35:41.958 --> 35:42.938
Are you sure?

35:44.982 --> 35:47.372
We're fairly certain. Yeah.
No...

35:49.446 --> 35:49.726
No.

35:55.062 --> 35:57.972
Tom, there's something you need to
know.

35:58.230 --> 35:59.210
They've um...

36:00.678 --> 36:01.548
They...um...

36:02.982 --> 36:05.362
We've found out who killed Danny.

36:08.454 --> 36:10.434
Sweetheart, it was your dad.

36:11.190 --> 36:11.940
Yes, love.

36:14.070 --> 36:15.510
I can't explain it.

36:17.526 --> 36:19.146
I really wish I could.

36:20.550 --> 36:20.830
OK.

36:24.870 --> 36:26.600
Tom, I have to ask you.

36:27.030 --> 36:30.650
Why did you send those threatening
emails to Danny?

36:31.350 --> 36:34.940
He said he didn't want to be my
friend any more.

36:34.950 --> 36:36.920
Said he found a new friend.

36:39.270 --> 36:40.190
I was angry.

36:42.438 --> 36:44.108
It was Dad, wasn't it?

36:45.750 --> 36:48.190
A 38-year-old man from Broadchurch

36:48.486 --> 36:52.085
has today been charged
with the murder of Daniel Latimer.

36:52.086 --> 36:56.866
Danny's family have been informed
and ask for privacy at this time.

36:58.278 --> 37:00.128
Have you heard who it is?

37:00.294 --> 37:01.914
Yeah. Just got a call.

37:02.166 --> 37:05.765
I would ask all members of the media
not to do anything

37:05.766 --> 37:10.076
that would prejudice the suspect's...
Who is it? Who did it?

37:13.686 --> 37:14.086
Olly.

37:20.022 --> 37:22.757
As the senior investigating officer,
I would ask...

37:22.758 --> 37:25.493
..that the town is now left alone

37:25.494 --> 37:27.797
to come to terms with what took
place here.

37:27.798 --> 37:29.598
No.
Just get your stuff.

37:30.822 --> 37:31.982
Get your things.

37:32.406 --> 37:36.776
We're not looking for anyone else in
relation to the killing.

37:38.166 --> 37:41.506
This has been a delicate, complex
investigation,

37:41.766 --> 37:45.186
and it has left its mark on
a close-knit town.

37:45.798 --> 37:48.821
Now is the time for Broadchurch to be
left...

37:48.822 --> 37:51.269
to grieve and heal,
away from the spotlight.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.320
Thank you.

38:50.454 --> 38:53.534
I never did this. You've got five
minutes.

39:27.318 --> 39:27.778
Hey...

39:30.486 --> 39:33.626
You were our friend.
You were in our house.

39:34.662 --> 39:36.162
I know... I'm sorry.

39:37.254 --> 39:38.284
I'm so sorry.

39:47.766 --> 39:51.077
Not man enough to kill your own boy?
You had to take mine?

39:51.078 --> 39:52.468
It was an accident.

39:54.390 --> 39:58.030
I put him on the beach so you'd know
I didn't...

39:58.422 --> 40:03.252
I could have left him in the sea.
Have you heard yourself, Joe? Hm?

40:03.462 --> 40:07.781
He only came to me in the first place
because you were no sort of father to him,

40:07.782 --> 40:11.732
because you hit him.
Don't use me as a fucking excuse!

40:19.014 --> 40:24.594
It was once, only ever once, and I'll
suffer for that for my whole life now.

40:28.950 --> 40:31.440
You did things to him, didn't you?

40:31.542 --> 40:35.432
I know that they say you didn't,
but...you must have.

40:37.878 --> 40:40.438
I... I swear. Honestly, I never did.

40:43.782 --> 40:47.372
Don't put this on me.
I only ever cared for him.

40:51.558 --> 40:53.358
You have to believe that.

40:55.878 --> 40:57.958
I thought I'd hate you, Joe.

40:59.766 --> 41:01.566
But seeing you in here...

41:01.638 --> 41:03.728
..you're not even worth that.

41:06.966 --> 41:08.176
I just pity you.

41:10.278 --> 41:11.908
Because you're nothing.

41:27.558 --> 41:29.888
All right, mate? All right, mate?

41:32.742 --> 41:33.772
I'm so sorry.

41:37.062 --> 41:37.402
Mag?

41:38.214 --> 41:38.964
Thank you.

41:40.086 --> 41:42.156
I'm going to go for a walk.

41:42.246 --> 41:45.269
Is it the new one?
It is the new one, yeah.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.840
How you doing, Freddy?

41:49.878 --> 41:50.628
DS Miller?

41:54.630 --> 41:57.820
I'm so sorry for what you're going
through.

41:59.382 --> 42:00.942
Don't talk to anyone.

42:40.422 --> 42:42.102
How could you not know?

43:15.270 --> 43:18.293
How could any adult be in love with
an 11-year-old boy?

43:18.294 --> 43:19.684
Is he a paedophile?

43:20.598 --> 43:24.197
The pathologist said there was no
record of abuse on Danny,

43:24.198 --> 43:25.925
either historic or recent.

43:25.926 --> 43:30.245
I asked Tom and he said Joe never
touched him, so what does that make him?

43:30.246 --> 43:32.216
Why do you need a category?

43:32.406 --> 43:33.916
I need to understand.

43:39.462 --> 43:39.982
Well...

43:42.630 --> 43:45.660
Just because he didn't abuse either
boy...

43:46.950 --> 43:50.720
..it doesn't mean that
he wouldn't have gone on to.

43:50.982 --> 43:53.832
Doesn't mean he would have, either.
No.

43:55.302 --> 43:56.802
We'll never be sure.

44:04.518 --> 44:06.248
He said he was in love.

44:07.254 --> 44:10.874
Maybe he was romanticising
to justify what he felt.

44:11.574 --> 44:13.884
Or...or maybe that's as it was.

44:18.198 --> 44:20.168
I don't have these answers.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.878
People are unknowable.

44:23.526 --> 44:23.986
And...

44:27.558 --> 44:32.338
You can never really know what goes
on inside someone else's heart.

44:34.038 --> 44:35.658
I should have seen it.

44:36.198 --> 44:38.288
How?
I'm a bloody detective.

44:39.222 --> 44:43.662
Miller the brilliant copper
who was lying next to the murderer.

44:45.558 --> 44:46.998
I want to kill him.

44:49.878 --> 44:51.388
When did you suspect?

44:51.894 --> 44:56.645
Last day or so. There was an email
account on Danny's missing phone.

44:56.646 --> 44:58.446
He only had two contacts.

44:58.518 --> 45:00.838
It was just Tom...and Joe, so...

45:08.454 --> 45:10.834
Don't trust.

45:12.198 --> 45:14.228
I really wanted to be wrong.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.877
Wessex Police tonight announce
they have made an arrest

45:25.878 --> 45:29.018
in the murder of 11-year-old Danny
Latimer.

46:06.342 --> 46:07.442
The Bible says:

46:10.518 --> 46:13.438
Let all bitterness and wrath and
anger...

46:16.566 --> 46:18.496
..and clamour and slander...

46:23.190 --> 46:24.870
..be put away from you,

46:25.638 --> 46:27.208
along with all malice.

46:28.518 --> 46:30.198
Be kind to one another.

46:30.966 --> 46:32.016
Tender-hearted.

46:34.422 --> 46:35.822
Forgive one another,

46:38.742 --> 46:40.832
as God in Christ forgave you.

46:46.806 --> 46:49.076
After what we've been through...

46:51.414 --> 46:52.564
..I don't know.

46:56.742 --> 46:59.662
But we have a responsibility to
ourselves

47:02.646 --> 47:03.916
and to our God...

47:07.542 --> 47:08.232
..to try.

47:26.262 --> 47:27.412
What'll you do?

47:29.718 --> 47:33.098
Go somewhere else,
give the kids a fresh start.

47:33.462 --> 47:34.792
Your life is here.

47:35.622 --> 47:38.582
How can I walk down the high street
now?

47:39.078 --> 47:40.178
What about you?

47:41.094 --> 47:42.124
Oh, I'm done.

47:44.838 --> 47:46.988
Medicalled out. It's all over.

47:49.446 --> 47:51.896
Look at us. Former detectives club.

48:39.990 --> 48:40.390
Look.

48:45.750 --> 48:46.670
What's that?

48:57.414 --> 48:58.984
How did everyone know?

48:59.430 --> 49:00.410
Was this you?

49:01.590 --> 49:02.920
I passed the word.

49:04.902 --> 49:06.642
Maybe the word was good.

49:07.305 --> 49:13.178
