00:07.572 --> 00:09.706

00:15.422 --> 00:18.255
(Clatter) <i>Yep, he settled
down pretty much everywhere.</i>

00:21.253 --> 00:22.862
So did you hear the buzz on the block?
(Turns on TV)

00:22.966 --> 00:25.207
The new neighbors have finally moved into the Meenahan's house.
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

00:25.322 --> 00:27.451
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. I'm bringing these over

00:27.532 --> 00:28.894
to welcome 'em
to the neighborhood.

00:29.006 --> 00:30.306
You're bringing potato chips?

00:30.406 --> 00:31.675
It doesn't matter
what you bring.

00:31.775 --> 00:33.134
It's that
you brought something.

00:33.247 --> 00:34.357
So you wanna come with me?

00:34.455 --> 00:35.562
Not in any way.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.306
Aw, come on.
It's the neighborly thing to do.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.056
It'll give us a chance
to check out their stuff.

00:41.164 --> 00:42.431
We already know
it's better than ours.

00:42.536 --> 00:43.492
What's the point?

00:43.651 --> 00:44.767
(Sighs and crunches)

00:48.875 --> 00:49.816
Hey, mom.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.678
I was just filling in
my dates for wrestlerettes.

00:51.807 --> 00:53.434
If you thought I was
busy as a mascot,

00:53.568 --> 00:56.500
- I am gonna get even busier
as a wrestlerette. - Mm-hmm.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.191
Seriously. I'm gonna be
like one of those people

00:58.306 --> 01:00.135
who says they're crazy busy.

01:00.253 --> 01:02.359
That's how busy
I'm gonna be. (Laughs)

01:04.992 --> 01:07.073
Come on, Mike.
Last chance to go with me.

01:07.228 --> 01:09.364
It's not like you're doing
anything important.

01:09.485 --> 01:10.753
You know what? Hang on.

01:11.464 --> 01:13.038
<i>(Crowd cheering on TV)</i>

01:15.965 --> 01:16.705
(Exhales)

01:16.858 --> 01:19.450
Thanks, pal.
Tell 'em I said hi.

01:22.438 --> 01:23.471
(Knock on door)

01:24.572 --> 01:25.228
<i>(Sports game</i>
<i>playing indistinctly on TV)</i>

01:25.348 --> 01:27.704
Hi. Frankie Heck.
We just live down the street.

01:27.825 --> 01:29.778
You know, the house with all
the screaming coming out of it?

01:29.906 --> 01:31.113
(Both laugh)

01:31.229 --> 01:32.818
Anyway, it's just
a little something

01:32.949 --> 01:34.198
from our home to yours.

01:34.304 --> 01:34.973
Aw.

01:35.069 --> 01:36.454
That is so sweet.

01:36.553 --> 01:38.640
Colleen Webber. Get on in here.
It's cold out there.

01:38.746 --> 01:41.057
Whoa. Looks like a lot
of the neighbors

01:41.166 --> 01:42.224
have been stopping by.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.930
Well, no.
Just one, actually.

01:44.045 --> 01:45.585
Nancy Donahue.
Do you know her?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.441
Uh, yeah.
I think I do.

01:47.572 --> 01:48.644
(Men shouting) Oh!

01:48.735 --> 01:49.898
- Come on!
- Unbelievable!

01:50.016 --> 01:51.375
That's my husband. He's
watching the game

01:51.481 --> 01:53.073
with a few guys he met at work.

01:53.272 --> 01:55.723
Honey, Jeff!
Come meet the neighbor!

01:56.164 --> 01:58.531
Hey. Sorry about
the noise.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.802
- Hi. I'm Jeff.
- Hi. Jeff. Frankie Heck.

02:00.919 --> 02:03.866
Hi. I'm gonna stare at you
for three seconds,

02:03.990 --> 02:05.733
then I'll never forget
your name.

02:07.417 --> 02:08.967
Locked and loaded.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.559
He's amazing with names.

02:10.686 --> 02:11.900
Thanks...

02:11.997 --> 02:12.933
Rhonda, right?

02:13.046 --> 02:14.352
(Frankie and Jeff laugh)

02:14.443 --> 02:16.023
Hey, did you bring these,
Frankie?

02:16.233 --> 02:19.480
Have to say, hands down,
best welcome gift we've gotten.

02:19.649 --> 02:21.765
(Man) Jeff, we're down by 12.

02:21.882 --> 02:23.050
Okay. I gotta get
back in there.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.622
- All right. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

02:24.732 --> 02:26.137
(Jeff) Lucky chips coming in.
<i>(Crowd cheers)</i>

02:26.244 --> 02:27.110
3-pointer!

02:27.229 --> 02:28.022
Yeah!
(Laughs)

02:28.118 --> 02:30.533
Gotta be the chips!
Thank Frankie!

02:30.645 --> 02:33.290
(Men chanting) Frankie! Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie!

02:33.443 --> 02:35.095
<i>Wow. Jeff was great.</i>

02:35.288 --> 02:36.627
<i>Just so much fun.</i>

02:37.339 --> 02:39.391
<i>And then I went back</i>
<i>to my house.</i>

02:39.602 --> 02:42.628
Ugh. It's so depressing in here.
(Switch clicks)

02:42.769 --> 02:44.950
A little light
wouldn't kill you, Mike.

02:45.129 --> 02:46.851
You're not a bat.
(Curtain rings swoosh)

02:46.983 --> 02:49.233
Hey. What are you doing?
It was fine in here.

02:49.355 --> 02:50.864
No, it was dank.

02:50.986 --> 02:53.135
(Switch clicks) You know,
it was just so much fun

02:53.274 --> 02:55.068
over at
the new neighbors' house.

02:55.181 --> 02:56.652
There were these guys
watching the game,

02:56.768 --> 02:58.670
and they were
all friendly and festive...

02:58.787 --> 03:00.300
You didn't invite 'em over,
did you?

03:00.431 --> 03:02.851
No, Mike. I didn't
invite anybody over.

03:02.957 --> 03:03.860
<i>(Whistle blows)</i> Attagirl.

03:03.978 --> 03:04.911
You know what?
Forget it.

03:05.027 --> 03:06.499
Just sit here alone in the dark

03:06.621 --> 03:08.173
and watch your TV.

03:08.299 --> 03:09.621
(Exhales)

03:11.011 --> 03:12.039
(Amplified voice)
And I can't believe

03:12.189 --> 03:14.381
that I have to say this
for the second consecutive week,

03:14.486 --> 03:16.925
but the bulletin board
outside of the main office

03:17.036 --> 03:19.609
is for approved announcements
only.

03:19.736 --> 03:21.253
Not pictures of your heinies.

03:21.363 --> 03:23.024
(Laughter) All right.

03:23.155 --> 03:26.119
And now a message
from the cheerleaders.

03:26.518 --> 03:28.012
(Girl) - All right, Courtney!
(Girl) - Go, Debbie!

03:28.144 --> 03:29.599
(Girls) Go, Hens!

03:29.733 --> 03:31.862
So the Orson High
wrestling team,

03:31.980 --> 03:33.526
which we never
really knew about,

03:33.695 --> 03:36.399
is expected to do
super well this season,

03:36.527 --> 03:39.305
and we're uber-pumped.
Aren't we, Deb?

03:39.405 --> 03:40.725
We sure are, Court.

03:40.919 --> 03:44.522
And it's sad, 'cause they don't
get the school spirit they need.

03:44.678 --> 03:47.204
So we, the football
and basketball cheerleaders,

03:47.311 --> 03:49.642
have decided to do
triple duty this year

03:49.765 --> 03:51.686
and be the wrestling
cheerleaders, too!

03:51.796 --> 03:53.992
(Debbie and Courtney scream,
students cheer)

03:54.091 --> 03:55.417
(Courtney) Say it with us!

03:55.563 --> 03:58.255
(Both chanting)
Never give up! Never give in!

03:58.407 --> 04:01.340
Thundering Hens
fight for that pin!

04:01.702 --> 04:02.980
Mom!

04:04.145 --> 04:06.376
Axl, get off your girlfriend
and take out the trash

04:06.508 --> 04:08.591
like I already told you to
five times today.

04:08.717 --> 04:10.265
Ugh. Okay.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.078
Don't move a muscle.
(Chuckles)

04:14.357 --> 04:15.619
(Sighs)

04:16.654 --> 04:18.382
It's nice to finally
see your face.

04:18.499 --> 04:20.452
I've really only seen
the back of your head before.

04:20.574 --> 04:22.377
You have a very oblong head.

04:22.923 --> 04:24.116
(Whispers) Oblong.

04:24.227 --> 04:25.841
Hey. You're into
"Planet Nowhere"?

04:25.973 --> 04:27.507
God, I spent so much time
reading those books,

04:27.634 --> 04:29.014
my vision started to blur.

04:29.119 --> 04:30.543
Really? You, too?
(Door closes)

04:30.642 --> 04:31.482
Who's your favorite character?

04:31.599 --> 04:32.501
- Soran!
- Soran!

04:32.659 --> 04:34.102
So many people
prefer the Vernegos...

04:34.224 --> 04:35.067
- Oh.
- but not me.

04:35.172 --> 04:37.306
Brick! Go nerd out
somewhere else.

04:37.504 --> 04:39.051
Silligan. Am I right?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.481
(Laughs)

04:42.671 --> 04:43.866
Silligan.

04:44.009 --> 04:45.031
Ah.

04:46.018 --> 04:47.195
Hey, Frankie!

04:47.319 --> 04:49.197
Told you. Never forget.

04:49.329 --> 04:51.730
Oh. You out getting some exercise?
(Laughs)

04:51.833 --> 04:54.629
No. I was just returning
those casserole dishes

04:54.744 --> 04:55.685
to the Donahues.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.035
You didn't want that
paper plate back, did you?

04:58.152 --> 04:59.776
Oh, no.
That is our gift to you.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.504
(Both laugh)

05:03.549 --> 05:05.511
You know, Jeff,
this might sound weird,

05:05.638 --> 05:07.219
but you're really friendly,

05:07.350 --> 05:10.251
and my husband...
well, he's not always,

05:10.417 --> 05:11.451
and I was just wondering

05:11.589 --> 05:14.868
if maybe you could ask him
to hang out sometime.

05:15.147 --> 05:15.993
Oh. Uh...

05:16.094 --> 05:18.066
I don't want to imply that
he doesn't have any friends.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.845
It's just,
his dad is a recluse,

05:19.974 --> 05:22.076
and Mike definitely
has those tendencies.

05:22.179 --> 05:23.416
Not that he's gonna become one,

05:23.549 --> 05:25.000
but you know,
in the back of my mind,

05:25.127 --> 05:26.224
I worry about it.

05:26.358 --> 05:29.436
Oh, he's also a hoarder.
Mike's dad is, not Mike.

05:29.584 --> 05:30.433
Anyway...

05:30.544 --> 05:32.941
Listen, Frankie
I've got one rule in life--

05:33.056 --> 05:34.368
I'll have a beer with anyone.

05:36.938 --> 05:37.808
(Indistinct conversations)

05:37.973 --> 05:41.161
Courtney. Debbie.
We gotta talk.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.811
Hi. Are you
our new transfer student?

05:43.924 --> 05:45.344
Welcome to Orson High.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.076
I am not a transfer student.

05:47.208 --> 05:51.817
I'm Sue Heck. My brother is Axl?
You've talked to me at my house?

05:51.930 --> 05:53.458
You know what? Doesn't matter.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.369
Look, wrestlerettes
already exist,

05:56.485 --> 05:57.897
and that's <i>our</i> job.

05:58.061 --> 06:00.280
We're the ones who cheer
for the wrestling team,

06:00.422 --> 06:03.685
so your cheering services
will not be needed.

06:03.796 --> 06:04.771
Court, what are wrestlerettes?

06:04.910 --> 06:06.505
I don't know,
but it's a fun name.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.085
- We should use it.
- No!

06:08.222 --> 06:10.596
You can't use it
because I came up with it...

06:10.798 --> 06:13.319
last year,
when I founded wrestlerettes.

06:13.431 --> 06:15.285
Wait, I don't think "founded"
is a word, is it?

06:15.418 --> 06:17.550
Mm, I think people
mostly say "found,"

06:17.686 --> 06:18.873
like "lost and found."

06:19.010 --> 06:21.027
Oh, is that
what you're looking for?

06:21.140 --> 06:22.284
It's in the main office.

06:22.409 --> 06:23.634
And totally feel free

06:23.755 --> 06:25.524
to come watch us cheer
for the wrestlers.

06:25.648 --> 06:27.551
And good luck
at lost and found.

06:43.179 --> 06:44.306
Hello?

06:44.416 --> 06:46.012
Oh, hi!

06:46.196 --> 06:47.052
Yeah, hang on.

06:47.171 --> 06:48.357
Mike, it's for you.

06:48.486 --> 06:50.746
It's never for me.
It's probably some solicitor.

06:50.859 --> 06:53.692
It's not a solicitor.
It's Jeff, our new neighbor.

06:53.824 --> 06:55.616
That's what they tell you
to get you on the phone.

06:55.715 --> 06:56.573
Just hang up.

06:56.714 --> 06:59.385
Mike, I'm pretty sure it's him.

06:59.937 --> 07:01.019
Why is he calling <i>me?</i>

07:01.133 --> 07:02.741
I don't know.
Just take it.

07:02.843 --> 07:03.771
Find out what he wants.

07:03.887 --> 07:05.242
I don't know what he wants.

07:05.351 --> 07:06.611
(Lowered voice)
He can hear you.

07:08.854 --> 07:10.566
Uh... hello?

07:12.247 --> 07:13.634
(Camera shutter clicks) Axl?

07:13.752 --> 07:15.781
Shh. I'm talking
to my lady.

07:16.257 --> 07:17.782
(Clicks) That doesn't
look like talking.

07:17.890 --> 07:19.930
We're snapchatting.
It's for grown-ups.

07:20.045 --> 07:22.133
You'll do it, too, in a few
years when you get a phone.

07:22.257 --> 07:24.209
And then in a hundred years
when you get a girlfriend.

07:24.336 --> 07:25.397
(Laughs) (Click)

07:25.502 --> 07:26.657
Right.

07:26.802 --> 07:28.336
Can I ask you something?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.241
Do you ever worry that Cassidy
might get bored with you

07:31.366 --> 07:33.710
if you don't share the keys
to a lasting relationship,

07:33.842 --> 07:36.785
such as friendship
and intellectual stimulation?

07:36.933 --> 07:38.041
Just thinking out loud.
(Click)

07:38.153 --> 07:40.019
Ugh. Where'd you hear all that junk?
(Click)

07:40.139 --> 07:41.496
At the library
in the dollar bin,

07:41.611 --> 07:44.544
I picked up "Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus."

07:44.664 --> 07:47.154
Not actually a science fiction
book, as it turns out.

07:47.303 --> 07:48.579
(Keypad clicking)
But it did talk a lot

07:48.694 --> 07:50.760
about how a couple needs
to find common ground

07:50.881 --> 07:52.408
to keep
the relationship strong.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.397
Hey, we got plenty in common.

07:54.525 --> 07:55.457
We both think I'm awesome.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.145
Now just shut up. I gotta say
good night to my girlfriend.

07:58.824 --> 07:59.979
(Camera shutter clicks)

08:00.285 --> 08:01.770
See you then.
(Beep)

08:02.134 --> 08:03.313
So?

08:03.993 --> 08:05.125
(Bottles rattle) So?

08:05.239 --> 08:06.465
What was that about?

08:06.584 --> 08:08.052
Uh, he asked me
to watch the game with him.

08:08.162 --> 08:10.278
(Cap fizzes) I said fine.
That was it.

08:10.394 --> 08:11.961
Ooh. Where you gonna go?

08:12.336 --> 08:13.067
I don't know.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.367
Well, is it gonna be
a full dinner,

08:14.509 --> 08:16.575
or is it just drinks
and light snacks?

08:16.734 --> 08:18.178
It's not a wedding, Frankie.

08:18.549 --> 08:20.494
Well, okay.
That sounds super.

08:20.621 --> 08:22.739
Let me know if you need help
picking out an outfit.

08:24.853 --> 08:26.457
- Oh! What a shot.
- Mm.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.689
<i>(Man on TV) 41 to 44!</i>

08:27.817 --> 08:29.111
You must have played
back in the day.

08:29.228 --> 08:31.290
I haven't played in a while.
My knee.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.208
You still have
your original knee?

08:33.438 --> 08:35.181
I'm like 50% titanium.

08:35.296 --> 08:36.591
Sucks gettin' old, doesn't it?

08:36.705 --> 08:37.703
Yeah, I hear you.

08:37.816 --> 08:39.557
Sometimes I have to pee
<i>while</i> I'm peeing. (Laughs)

08:39.683 --> 08:41.240
<i>Good!</i>
<i>(Cheering)</i>

08:41.440 --> 08:42.235
Tied it up.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.182
- Nice shot.
- Yes.

08:44.307 --> 08:45.238
Sorry, pulled
my right shoulder.

08:45.343 --> 08:46.168
I gotta go left.

08:46.262 --> 08:48.532
Oh, that's a no-go for me.
Tweaked my back.

08:48.646 --> 08:50.317
- Ooh. - What do you say we just
sit and drink more beer?

08:50.452 --> 08:52.051
- That sounds good.
- All right.

08:56.784 --> 08:57.710
Hold on a sec.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.121
(Chuckles) I, uh...

08:59.695 --> 09:02.369
(Inhales) thought maybe
we could have a conversation.

09:02.912 --> 09:06.217
Thought maybe we could, uh,
you know, <i>con-verse.</i>

09:06.328 --> 09:07.728
Oh. Okay.

09:07.846 --> 09:09.776
What do you wanna
"con-verse" about?

09:09.994 --> 09:12.388
Well, uh, I thought
you could start,

09:12.512 --> 09:13.401
'cause, you know, I was the one

09:13.512 --> 09:16.211
that came up with the idea
of talking. (Laughs)

09:18.350 --> 09:20.067
(Clicks tongue) Okay.

09:20.174 --> 09:23.172
Uh, I'll start. Hey,
you going to the pep rally?

09:23.286 --> 09:25.180
Uh, no. Why would I?

09:25.296 --> 09:27.544
Come on, Axl.
I had two AP tests today.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.326
I don't feel like talking.
I hope that's cool.

09:30.476 --> 09:33.930
Yeah. Pfft. (Chuckles)
Totally cool, yeah.

09:35.965 --> 09:38.222
<i>Yep, Brick had gotten</i>
<i>into Axl's head,</i>

09:38.386 --> 09:40.673
<i>just like Sue had to do</i>
<i>with her wrestlerettes.</i>

09:40.783 --> 09:43.159
Okay. I know you all saw
the assembly the other day,

09:43.283 --> 09:45.890
and I am sure you had
the same reaction I did.

09:46.023 --> 09:47.377
Yeah, the cheerleaders
were really good.

09:47.564 --> 09:49.610
No. Weren't you listening?

09:49.741 --> 09:52.030
The cheerleaders are
stealing wrestlerettes from us.

09:52.162 --> 09:53.965
You guys, we have to
do something about this.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.323
That sounds like
it could take a while.

09:56.469 --> 09:57.952
This is the night
I usually bury things

09:58.091 --> 09:59.409
I found during the week.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.732
Oh, I could sew together
a spirit quilt

10:01.854 --> 10:02.691
for the cheerleaders,

10:02.813 --> 10:04.395
to bless them
in their endeavors.

10:04.509 --> 10:07.858
No. We're not burying anything,
and we are not blessing anyone.

10:08.027 --> 10:09.666
We built wrestlerettes
from the ground up,

10:09.758 --> 10:12.840
and we gotta fight for it.
Who's with me?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.179
Wait.
We're-- we're gonna fight?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.131
'Cause I got a sock full of
old batteries in my locker.

10:16.253 --> 10:17.250
I call the blonde one.

10:17.361 --> 10:18.640
Becky!

10:22.280 --> 10:24.496
So... my house
for the next one?

10:24.609 --> 10:25.883
You got it.
(Laughs)

10:26.181 --> 10:28.317
(Seat belt latch clicks) All right.
I'll see you around.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.377
Thanks. It was fun.

10:29.478 --> 10:30.709
Don't thank me.
Thank your wife.

10:30.809 --> 10:32.445
She's the one that suggested it.
(Closes door)

10:33.496 --> 10:34.777
Suggested what?

10:35.208 --> 10:36.530
You know, us getting together.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.259
Uh-huh?

10:38.514 --> 10:40.127
Yeah, she said you were shy.

10:40.229 --> 10:42.048
You're not shy.
If anything, you talk too much.

10:42.165 --> 10:43.981
(Laughs) I'm just kiddin'.

10:44.262 --> 10:45.234
Have a good one.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.863
(Shifts gears)
Yeah. Will do.

10:50.397 --> 10:51.529
(Door opens)

10:51.640 --> 10:53.169
Hi. How'd it go?
(Door closes)

10:53.274 --> 10:55.305
Did you ask Jeff
to hang out with me?

10:55.862 --> 10:57.552
What? No.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.887
I mean, I ran into him outside
when I got the mail.

11:00.008 --> 11:02.209
That's a "yes."
That's a Frankie "yes."

11:02.439 --> 11:04.213
(Sighs) What happened?

11:04.335 --> 11:05.936
Did-- did you have a bad time?

11:06.054 --> 11:08.519
- I had a fine time.
- Hey, you had a fine time.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.892
That's great. So you guys
getting together again?

11:11.013 --> 11:12.561
- Nope.
- Well, why not?

11:12.715 --> 11:15.720
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe 'cause I'm shy.

11:15.843 --> 11:16.933
Okay, listen...

11:17.048 --> 11:18.843
You telling guys I'm shy?

11:19.002 --> 11:21.671
First off,
you don't use that word.

11:21.803 --> 11:23.859
And if anything,
it's "stoic."

11:23.972 --> 11:25.799
Mike, it's not like I'm going
around talking about you.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.768
I only said
you were... stoic

11:28.926 --> 11:31.122
as to how it related
to your dad.

11:31.264 --> 11:33.158
W-what are you doing
talking about my dad?

11:33.287 --> 11:35.572
I don't know, just how you
can be sort of like him,

11:35.684 --> 11:37.620
and how he hardly leaves
the house and he's a hoarder,

11:37.778 --> 11:39.779
- and he--
- Are you out of your mind?

11:39.906 --> 11:41.673
Mike, who cares?
If you had a good time,

11:41.801 --> 11:43.591
what does it matter
how you and Jeff got together?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.201
Because I'm a grown man!

11:45.337 --> 11:46.893
Your wife doesn't call
other grown men

11:47.029 --> 11:49.442
and ask them to take you out.
It's weird.

11:49.549 --> 11:50.986
Yeah, but you weren't doing it.

11:51.099 --> 11:52.900
I'm not 5, Frankie.

11:53.024 --> 11:55.024
I don't need you to set up
playdates for me.

11:55.156 --> 11:56.473
I have friends, okay?

11:56.587 --> 11:57.380
And I told him that.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.530
- I totally told him you have friends.
- Aah!

11:59.665 --> 12:02.273
Mike, I'm sorry. I thought
you two would like each other.

12:02.403 --> 12:04.356
Even Nancy Donahue thought
it would be a good idea

12:04.483 --> 12:05.560
to get you guys together.

12:05.686 --> 12:06.916
You talked to Nancy Donahue
about me.

12:07.034 --> 12:08.532
That's it. We're movin'.

12:08.664 --> 12:11.538
Look, it doesn't matter
how you and Jeff met.

12:11.666 --> 12:13.540
The point is, you can't let
pride stand in the way

12:13.657 --> 12:15.248
of what could be
a great friendship.

12:15.369 --> 12:18.278
Frankie, no more talking
about me to anybody.

12:18.401 --> 12:20.237
Period. Got it?

12:20.962 --> 12:22.069
(Door creaks)

12:23.205 --> 12:25.626
(Frankie) Can I at least
tell Nancy it went well?

12:31.534 --> 12:32.686
(Door creaks)

12:33.709 --> 12:36.311
I need you to teach me stuff
so I can talk to people.

12:36.510 --> 12:37.977
It's Cassidy, isn't it?

12:38.101 --> 12:40.075
You're feeling
intellectually inferior.

12:40.216 --> 12:41.412
No.

12:42.951 --> 12:45.933
But if you must know,
I feel she's smarter than me.

12:46.044 --> 12:48.896
Ah.
I knew this day would come--

12:49.026 --> 12:52.305
a day I'd become more to you
than something to Indian burn,

12:52.441 --> 12:55.323
whip a towel at,
or force to smell your farts.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.745
Just shut up and help me.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.002
(Thud)

12:58.316 --> 12:59.922
Now you don't need
to know all of them.

13:00.036 --> 13:01.130
Just pick one.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.575
That way,
if someone talks to you

13:02.659 --> 13:05.092
about a particular artist,
you respond by saying,

13:05.221 --> 13:06.824
"that's interesting
that you like this artist,

13:06.944 --> 13:08.526
but I like... blank."

13:08.640 --> 13:10.209
Hmm. Great. Perfect.

13:10.318 --> 13:11.852
Now just show me
this Blank dude's stuff,

13:11.947 --> 13:14.210
and let's kick art's sorry ass.
Ha ha!

13:14.380 --> 13:16.926
JD Salinger's famous book
on teen angst

13:17.047 --> 13:18.553
is called
"Catcher In The..."

13:18.678 --> 13:19.637
"Rye."

13:19.853 --> 13:21.181
(Crunching)

13:21.273 --> 13:23.349
The character Atticus Finch
is from the book...

13:23.465 --> 13:24.697
"To Kill A Mockingbird."

13:24.805 --> 13:27.047
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
most famous novel

13:27.161 --> 13:29.023
is entitled "The Great..."

13:29.138 --> 13:30.486
- "Escape."
- No.

13:30.598 --> 13:31.506
Ugh. "Train Robbery."

13:31.662 --> 13:32.608
Sorry. (Crunching)

13:32.713 --> 13:33.950
Uh... the "Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown."

13:34.064 --> 13:34.989
Wait. Wait.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.639
"Gatsby."
"Great Gatsby."

13:36.770 --> 13:37.735
(Laughs)

13:37.958 --> 13:40.947
(Resumes crunching)
Whoo! Ha! I win!

13:41.447 --> 13:43.724
<i>Well, Axl might have been</i>
<i>feeling victorious,</i>

13:43.854 --> 13:45.652
<i>but I was feeling a
little guilty.</i> (Beeping)

13:45.747 --> 13:48.305
<i>I'd overstepped my bounds,</i>
<i>and I knew I had to fix things.</i>

13:48.462 --> 13:51.656
Hi, Jeff? It's Frankie,
your new neighbor.

13:51.809 --> 13:54.787
Yeah, hi.
So here's the thing--

13:54.947 --> 13:57.135
Mike had a really good time
the other night,

13:57.260 --> 13:58.971
and I know he would love
to do it again,

13:59.097 --> 14:01.331
but he's not exactly the type
to pick up the phone.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.916
Not that he's socially awkward.
He has friends.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.907
So if I didn't make
that clear before, he does.

14:07.057 --> 14:09.916
But he also has that loner DNA

14:10.042 --> 14:11.611
I mean, you should
meet his brother.

14:11.735 --> 14:13.909
The guy lived in a tent
for a year.

14:14.108 --> 14:17.765
But <i>anyway,</i> if you wanted
to ask him out again,

14:17.895 --> 14:19.183
that would be great.

14:19.334 --> 14:21.503
But he was a little hinky that
I asked you in the first place,

14:21.616 --> 14:23.087
so if you talk to him,

14:23.212 --> 14:26.288
maybe you don't mention
that I call...

14:26.862 --> 14:28.585
Okay. Talk later. Bye.
(Beep)

14:29.791 --> 14:31.411
Have you lost your mind?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.967
(Amplified voice) And that's why
you should always wear socks.

14:37.089 --> 14:38.775
Okay, students, please put
your hands together

14:38.923 --> 14:41.874
for something we've never had
at this school before.

14:41.985 --> 14:44.428
Hmm? Wrestling cheerleaders!

14:44.569 --> 14:47.643
(Cheering)

14:51.210 --> 14:54.380
Not so fast.

15:04.378 --> 15:06.713
Uh, what are you doing here?

15:06.837 --> 15:09.573
What we are doing here
is fighting for wrestlerettes,

15:09.765 --> 15:11.345
which <i>I</i> founded.

15:11.470 --> 15:14.785
Yeah, <i>founded.</i>
It's a word. Look it up.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.878
- I don't get it. Do you get it, Deb?
- No, I don't.

15:18.014 --> 15:19.914
How about we let
the school decide

15:20.028 --> 15:21.683
who gets to cheer
for the wrestlers?

15:21.846 --> 15:25.100
Oh, that's right.
Time to bring it on.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.672
(Both) Oh, my God.
It's a cheer-off!

15:27.820 --> 15:31.241
It's a cheer-off! Whoo!
(Cheering)

15:35.962 --> 15:40.568
(Marching band playing)

15:45.661 --> 15:47.473
(Cheerleaders)
"H"! "E"! "N"! "S"!

15:48.093 --> 15:50.939
(Students cheering)

15:51.744 --> 15:54.862
♪

15:55.785 --> 15:58.471
(Cheering)

15:59.497 --> 16:03.677
(Music continues playing,
students cheering in distance)

16:04.939 --> 16:06.985
Whoa. Axl. What are you doing here?
(Door closes)

16:07.081 --> 16:08.062
Why wouldn't I be here?

16:08.180 --> 16:09.644
'Cause the pep rally
is going on.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.890
And if everybody's
not suitably peppy,

16:13.015 --> 16:15.350
there's no way
we'll take down Roosevelt.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.956
Eh, I don't wanna be there.

16:17.092 --> 16:20.313
I wanna be here,
because art is awesome.

16:20.435 --> 16:23.732
(Laughs)
Ooh. Like what you're doing.

16:23.862 --> 16:26.526
Sort of reminds me of, uh,
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

16:26.640 --> 16:29.654
which he actually painted
from memory during the day.

16:29.798 --> 16:33.146
So... uh, did you know Van Gogh
did his most famous paintings

16:33.273 --> 16:34.690
the last two years of his life?

16:34.799 --> 16:37.335
Also, "To Kill A Mockingbird"
is a significant book.

16:37.459 --> 16:38.541
I could talk about that
for hours.

16:38.659 --> 16:39.989
I can also talk about
"Catcher In The Rye,"

16:40.118 --> 16:41.322
but not for as long.

16:41.776 --> 16:44.037
Okay. What's going on here?

16:44.295 --> 16:45.375
(Sighs)

16:45.905 --> 16:47.221
I don't know.
(Chuckles)

16:47.457 --> 16:49.908
Um, doesn't it bother you

16:50.020 --> 16:52.768
we don't have
deep conversations and stuff?

16:53.845 --> 16:55.185
Not really.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.594
Guess I never thought about it.

16:56.706 --> 16:58.161
Does it bother you?

Well...

17:00.415 --> 17:01.799
yeah. (Chuckles)

17:01.939 --> 17:02.845
Kinda.

17:02.972 --> 17:06.416
I... I know what's
going on in here,

17:06.522 --> 17:07.547
but I don't always say it.

17:07.657 --> 17:09.203
You know, I don't always
express it.

17:09.330 --> 17:11.569
And before,
I never really cared,

17:11.690 --> 17:15.978
but when you start, like...
falling for somebody...

17:17.486 --> 17:19.483
I just want to make sure
that you see

17:19.607 --> 17:21.078
there's more to me than...

17:21.974 --> 17:24.144
you know, everybody else sees.

17:25.152 --> 17:27.247
That's
a pretty deep thought, Axl.

17:27.830 --> 17:28.995
Oh, yeah?

17:29.094 --> 17:31.038
Yeah. I like it.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.111
You like my thought, huh?
My thought turn you on?

17:34.219 --> 17:35.021
Oh, yeah.

17:35.119 --> 17:36.119
How about
I give you another one?

17:36.226 --> 17:37.138
I'd like another one.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.642
I bet you would.

17:53.438 --> 17:55.592
But we can do this.

17:56.065 --> 17:59.088
This is the moment we've been
waiting for our entire lives.

17:59.186 --> 18:00.774

19:42.810 --> 19:44.771
<i>I stepped over the line
with Jeff.</i> (Beeping)

19:44.863 --> 19:47.425
<i>So I did what I should have</i>
<i>done right from the beginning--</i>

19:47.641 --> 19:48.851
<i>I called his wife.</i>

19:48.976 --> 19:50.945
Hi, Colleen,
it's Frankie, your neighbor.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.421
I hope you don't mind me leaving
a message on your cell,

19:53.536 --> 19:56.578
but, well,
I was a bit of a dope,

19:56.703 --> 19:58.742
and I called Jeff
so he would call Mike again,

19:58.866 --> 20:00.036
and Mike found out.

20:00.205 --> 20:02.149
And I promised him
I wouldn't call Jeff again.

20:02.277 --> 20:05.338
So that's why
I'm reaching out to you,

20:05.464 --> 20:07.309
just wife-to-wife.
'Cause it would be silly

20:07.426 --> 20:09.557
if they didn't get together
because of what <i>I</i> did.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.565
So if you could tell your
husband to just call my husband

20:12.689 --> 20:13.675
so they could grab
another beer,

20:13.788 --> 20:15.586
that would be great.
<i>(Voice mail beeps)</i>

20:15.683 --> 20:17.721
Hi. It's Frankie
calling back real quick.

20:17.869 --> 20:19.028
Now that I thought about it,

20:19.169 --> 20:20.886
maybe don't tell Jeff
I called you,

20:21.345 --> 20:22.587
'cause that might be weird.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.151
<i>(Beep)</i>
Hi. Frankie again.

20:24.317 --> 20:25.888
You know how I said
in the last message

20:26.019 --> 20:27.340
not to tell Jeff I called you?

20:27.458 --> 20:30.243
I realized I shouldn't ask you
to lie to your husband.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.208
So however you wanna
handle it amongst yourselves

20:32.322 --> 20:35.212
is your business,
but how 'bout no one tell Mike?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.638
(Laughs) Just let's none of us
tell Mike, okay?

20:37.757 --> 20:38.389
<i>(Beep)</i>

20:38.495 --> 20:39.301
Sorry to call back again,

20:39.400 --> 20:40.603
but I just wanna be
super-duper clear.

20:40.711 --> 20:41.814
'Cause you don't really know me,

20:41.934 --> 20:43.717
and I don't want you to think
I keep secrets from my husband.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.801
'Cause I don't.
We have a very good marriage.

20:45.897 --> 20:47.125
I mean,
everybody has their problems.

20:47.239 --> 20:48.952
But I mean, it's good.
No, it's solid.

20:49.062 --> 20:51.262
<i>(Beep)</i> I feel like I'm
starting to sound crazy.

20:51.385 --> 20:52.565
But someone who knows
they're crazy

20:52.684 --> 20:54.944
isn't really crazy, right?
Like Hitler.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.064
<i>(Beep)</i> Oh, God, I just
realized I mentioned Hitler,

20:57.179 --> 20:58.558
and that's <i>really</i> inappropriate.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.009
I don't even know
if you're Jewish.

21:00.124 --> 21:02.238
Doesn't matter.
Hitler's horrible for everybody.

21:02.390 --> 21:05.392
You know what?
Let's just start over.

21:05.503 --> 21:06.815
You can tell Jeff
whatever you want...

21:06.926 --> 21:08.483
<i>Well, it's no surprise</i>
<i>that we didn't see</i>

21:08.599 --> 21:10.261
<i>our new neighbors much</i>
<i>after that.</i>

21:10.379 --> 21:13.262
<i>Although we did see them</i>
<i>briefly the other day.</i>

21:19.782 --> 21:21.368
<i>I don't know. Maybe it's true--</i>

21:21.493 --> 21:23.127
<i>I can't leave</i>
<i>well enough alone.</i>

21:23.260 --> 21:25.838
<i>But I like to think</i>
<i>I'm striving for excellence</i>

21:25.954 --> 21:27.319
<i>in a family of settlers.</i>

21:27.320 --> 21:30.418
<i>Sometimes you succeeed
and sometimes you don't.</i>

21:30.555 --> 21:32.530
<i>You know, I'm glad we didn't
become friends with them.</i>

21:32.641 --> 21:33.828
<i>They're weird.</i>

21:34.271 --> 21:36.144
<i>Yeah. They're
definitely weird.</i>
