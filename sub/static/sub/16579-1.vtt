00:14.139 --> 00:18.767
This be a tale of the high seas.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.522
A tale of fabulous treasure.

00:23.690 --> 00:29.153
A tale of three pirate brothers
what searched for the treasure.

00:31.239 --> 00:35.242
And a tale of how their plans
was thwarted...

00:35.410 --> 00:36.910
...by a cat...

00:37.078 --> 00:38.746
...and a mouse?

01:24.292 --> 01:28.796
He said, "Pull harder, you dogs,
and get all hands on deck."

02:04.666 --> 02:08.585
"All hands" includes paws, cat.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.915
Cursed.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.211
Cursed.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.672
Cursed is this map...

09:08.839 --> 09:12.759
...the map to the treasure
of the Spanish Mane.

09:12.927 --> 09:18.640
You cannot begin to imagine the horrors
the curse brings.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.976
So do not even try.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.271
But the curse can be avoided...

09:24.438 --> 09:29.943
...if you put the map
back in its bottle before sunset.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.737
Sunset.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.782
Sunset.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.714
Sunset.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.883
Sunset.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.219
Sunset!

09:56.387 --> 10:00.181
Sunset...

10:02.143 --> 10:05.312
Look what you did to me mast,
you stinking sea cat.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.356
What do you have to say for yourself?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.736
No, never mind,
I don't wanna hear your lies.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.945
I ought to...

10:16.240 --> 10:20.785
Well, what have we here?

10:23.914 --> 10:27.626
Shiver me timbers.
A treasure map.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.295
And if I remember the maps
I seen in me youth...

10:30.463 --> 10:33.757
...this one be leading to the lost riches...

10:34.342 --> 10:37.594
...of the Spanish Mane!

10:42.683 --> 10:46.102
Finding that treasure
has been a 40-year competition...

10:46.270 --> 10:48.897
...between me
and me two scurvy siblings...

10:49.065 --> 10:51.650
...Blue Pirate Bob
and Purple Pirate Paul.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.111
What a couple of ugly bilge rats they be.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.075
Now I'm gonna keelhaul you.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.162
I'm sorry.
Walk the plank.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.124
I was gonna make you walk the plank,
but now I be in such a fine mood...

11:08.292 --> 11:10.627
...I'll be holding off on it.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.671
For now.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.137
Nice work, Thomas.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.537
Hi, excuse me.
Hi. Now, he said:

11:45.705 --> 11:47.205
"I be Blue Pirate Bob...

11:47.373 --> 11:50.709
...and I don't take lightly
to no stowaways.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.919
You know what I do to stowaways?"

12:00.886 --> 12:01.928
Sorry.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.890
No, I don't feed them and make them
comfortable and see to their every need.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.768
But you're half right.
There will be some feeding...

12:09.437 --> 12:10.645
...to me mascot.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.066
Sorry, little fella, I'm just translating.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.372
What's that you say?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.458
Wanna bargain for your life, do ye?

12:39.341 --> 12:41.301
A treasure, says ye?

12:41.469 --> 12:45.388
Well, that makes the sweet pot sweeter,
doesn't it?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.557
And where might that be?

12:52.313 --> 12:56.566
Well, if it ain't the ship
of me no-good brother Red Pirate Ron.

12:57.151 --> 13:01.488
So you're saying he found
a treasure map, are ye?

13:06.076 --> 13:10.330
Well then, let's pay him
our traditional family visit, says I?

13:30.976 --> 13:34.312
That should keep the mast
from falling over again.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.829
What in the name of
Davy Jones' locker room?

13:59.588 --> 14:02.340
Me hated brother Blue Pirate Bob.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.552
So you smell me treasure map?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.512
Well, come and get it.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.516
Hi, Stan. What up?
How's the job going?

16:58.684 --> 17:00.977
Hey, Betty.
You know...

17:01.145 --> 17:04.564
...he mutters the same
indecipherable growl...

17:04.732 --> 17:07.191
...I translate it as best I can...

17:07.358 --> 17:10.361
...he gives me the occasional cracker.
You?

17:10.570 --> 17:14.574
Same old, same old.
I tell you, it's not like it used to be?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.910
It's getting so I can hardly
understand a word he's saying.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.579
I hear you.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.218
Break time's over.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.637
- Gotta run.
- See you, Stan.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.806
Avast ye swine.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.141
I'll send you to the bottom of the sea.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.530
This is for all that time you spent
hogging the bathroom, Brother Bob.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.242
Who am I translating for?

20:03.410 --> 20:06.495
Well, no one, I guess.

20:06.663 --> 20:07.914
Just habit.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.327
So...

21:28.495 --> 21:32.498
...thought you could steal
me treasure map, you scurvy dog?

21:40.048 --> 21:43.342
Go get that map, you mangy cat.

21:47.597 --> 21:51.684
There's an extra ration
of kippers in it for you.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.511
Remember...

23:08.678 --> 23:11.931
...you have until sunset
to return the map to the bottle...

23:12.599 --> 23:15.267
...or suffer its...

23:17.604 --> 23:19.105
...curse.

23:42.963 --> 23:47.425
You did good returning the map to me, cat.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.722
Now, let's end this party with a bang.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.984
Brother Ron, you wouldn't sink your own
flesh and blood now, would ye?

24:05.152 --> 24:07.069
Not to mention his beloved parrot.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.739
Aye, that I would.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.994
I found the map to the treasure
of the Spanish Mane.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.081
The Spanish Mane?

24:19.249 --> 24:22.460
Oh, no, that treasure be cursed.

24:22.627 --> 24:26.172
Our brother Purple Paul went lost
trying to find it.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.510
Aye, and so will ye.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.859
So long, Blue Pirate Bob.

24:47.027 --> 24:50.654
Give the fishes me regards.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.824
Sorry about that, Betty.
Talk to you later.

24:56.286 --> 25:01.540
Well, you never did forgive me
for taking the top bunk.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.043
Hey, take it easy, Stan.
Catch you later.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.825
Set sail for Yo Ho...

25:38.537 --> 25:39.745
Yo Ho Island.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.581
Aye, aye, Pirate Ron.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.215
Help yourself to me
own secret kipper store.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.935
Which apparently ain't much of a secret.

26:08.984 --> 26:14.822
Now, let's see, where be the tiny dot
that says, "Ye be here"?

26:30.130 --> 26:34.675
Cursed. You did not return
the map to the bottle by sunset...

26:34.843 --> 26:38.095
...and now you are all cursed.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.275
What's this about
returning the map to a bottle?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.319
This be the first I've heard of it.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.904
But I told you already.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.991
I told him.

27:00.785 --> 27:04.246
Yes, I did.

27:04.623 --> 27:09.793
And now, you are all cursed.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.841
This ship is now hereby
commissioned into the fleet...

27:16.009 --> 27:19.178
...of the Spanish Mane.

27:20.889 --> 27:25.476
Thomas, have ye anything
to say for yourself?

27:43.620 --> 27:45.788
I'll be outside.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.348
Red Pirate Ron, abandon ship.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.772
Start lowering the boat.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.584
Well, Thomas,
since all this be your fault...

29:13.752 --> 29:15.294
...row!

29:23.094 --> 29:26.722
I'll see you real soon.

29:30.059 --> 29:34.188
Having decided their ship
was of no further use to them...

29:34.355 --> 29:39.276
...the pirates set out in their lifeboat
to find the treasure.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.071
Though they faced peril after peril...

29:43.239 --> 29:47.451
...and extremely unpleasant seasickness...

29:48.077 --> 29:52.831
...at long last,
they reached their accursed goal.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.253
Yo Ho Island.

29:58.421 --> 30:03.091
The place on the map
where the treasure be buried.

30:09.891 --> 30:14.186
Rest assured, lad,
the dangers here be many...

30:14.354 --> 30:16.605
...and the rewards be few.

30:20.944 --> 30:25.906
Except for me,
for whom the rewards will be vast.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.159
Now, Thomas, row!

30:39.128 --> 30:43.507
This be going into
your permanent employee record.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.880
Who dares to enter me private sanctuary...

34:10.047 --> 34:14.134
...without me express
written or verbal permission?

34:15.887 --> 34:19.389
Quiet, you.
Can't understand a word you're saying.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.476
Well?
Why don't you answer, cat?

34:23.643 --> 34:25.687
You got your tongue?

34:32.779 --> 34:34.112
A mouse?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.531
I hates vermin.

34:36.866 --> 34:41.078
I'm gonna take the both of you
and have you keelhauled.

34:41.954 --> 34:44.371
And when that's finished...

34:44.540 --> 34:47.167
...in the unlikely event...

34:47.335 --> 34:49.210
...there's anything remaining...

34:49.378 --> 34:51.755
...which there won't be...

34:51.922 --> 34:56.802
...I'll gather up all the itty-bitty pieces
and feed them to the...

34:57.595 --> 35:00.180
Feed them to the...

35:01.057 --> 35:02.307
To the...

35:11.984 --> 35:13.693
Get them, boys!

35:25.206 --> 35:26.915
Get them, ye bumbling primates.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.000
I know what they're after.

35:29.168 --> 35:33.463
They're here for the treasure!

35:37.635 --> 35:39.302
Quiet, you.

38:35.021 --> 38:38.606
Blast ye.
I ain't finished me brunch yet.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.984
Fine.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.863
So you're here seeking the treasure,
are you?

38:46.198 --> 38:51.161
No, don't talk. I knows you are,
so there ain't no use lying.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.787
Now, I ain't gonna hurt you.

38:52.955 --> 38:57.208
All that spooky speechifying earlier
was just to try and scare you off.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.835
But I do wanna warn you.

38:59.295 --> 39:04.883
Do you know why I, Barnacle Paul,
be on this island in the first place?

39:07.595 --> 39:11.056
No, not the coconuts,
though they be mighty tasty.

39:13.726 --> 39:18.146
No, not the bananas either,
though high in potassium they be.

39:20.399 --> 39:22.692
No, it ain't for the monkeys either...

39:22.860 --> 39:25.737
...though they do keep
a tidy jungle clearing.

39:26.530 --> 39:30.325
No, it all started 40 years ago...

39:34.288 --> 39:37.540
...when me and me two brothers,
Ron and Bob...

39:37.708 --> 39:39.876
...had a love of treasure maps.

39:40.044 --> 39:44.672
One day, we found in our collection
the most prized map of them all...

39:44.840 --> 39:47.967
...the treasure of the Spanish Mane.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.470
That's mane as in m-a-n-e...

39:50.638 --> 39:54.182
...the fortune amassed by
Don Diego Clippershears...

39:54.350 --> 39:57.769
...the most famous wigmaker in Spain.

39:57.937 --> 40:02.524
He'd hidden his fabulous wealth
on an offshore island for tax purposes...

40:02.691 --> 40:05.443
...and I aimed to plunder it.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.946
Of course, me brothers had the same idea.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.407
They say the map were cursed...

40:10.574 --> 40:14.035
...so maybe that be why
the sound of our fighting...

40:14.203 --> 40:17.747
...was more than
our sweet mother could bear.

40:31.303 --> 40:35.223
So she dispatched
every last one of our maps.

40:40.187 --> 40:44.649
While Ron and Bob spent the next
40 years trying to find them...

40:45.609 --> 40:49.195
...I was the only one what had
seen enough of the Spanish Mane map...

40:49.363 --> 40:52.157
...to remember where the island be.

40:52.324 --> 40:54.742
Sweet mother of pearl!

40:54.910 --> 40:58.246
I had no idea there be
no working bathrooms on the island...

40:58.414 --> 41:00.665
...and I was horrified.

41:01.333 --> 41:04.669
But I made do,
and after searching 40 years...

41:04.837 --> 41:08.131
...I never found the treasure
of the Spanish Mane.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.551
I'm telling ye this
so you'll turn back now...

41:11.719 --> 41:17.056
...and ye won't have to live through
the same despair I have.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.524
Now, if only I'd had that map.

41:26.692 --> 41:30.695
That would have been
a totally different story.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.744
You're going anyway?

41:37.912 --> 41:39.746
Well, good luck.

41:39.914 --> 41:44.709
No, just because I've failed
for 40 years don't mean ye will.

41:44.877 --> 41:48.213
No, go, have fun.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.674
When the madness sets in...

41:51.842 --> 41:55.553
...be sure to say hi for me.

42:00.726 --> 42:05.522
Well, if it ain't me own
brother Purple Paul.

42:05.689 --> 42:11.569
I told you, I don't wanna be part
of your whole color-scheme-name thing.

42:11.737 --> 42:14.239
I'm Barnacle Paul.

42:15.616 --> 42:16.950
Quiet, you.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.536
Hi, Chuck.

42:21.413 --> 42:26.167
That cat stole me map to the
treasure of the Spanish Mane.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.548
The Spanish Mane?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.342
That be the map to the Spanish Mane?

42:38.347 --> 42:39.889
Get it!

43:13.382 --> 43:14.632
I don't believe it.

43:14.800 --> 43:21.306
After all these years, we are gonna finally
find the treasure of the Spanish Mane.

43:23.892 --> 43:27.270
Sure, "we."

44:30.292 --> 44:33.878
This be where the X on the map
be located.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.798
Blast, I always meant to search here.

44:37.174 --> 44:40.009
Does it count if I meant to search here?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.222
No.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.855
Avast, me brother.
'Tis the animal scalawags.

45:07.329 --> 45:10.832
A split.
That be a difficult shot to make.

45:32.312 --> 45:34.689
Oh, dear.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.983
I'm not repeating that.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.197
Well, that was close...

47:06.365 --> 47:11.494
...but now that we all be back together,
let's try and stay togeth...

47:28.971 --> 47:32.473
X marks the spot.

48:04.298 --> 48:07.174
Greetings, fortune hunters.

48:07.342 --> 48:12.388
I am the spirit of Don
Diego Clippershears.

48:12.556 --> 48:15.600
You survived the curse of my map...

48:15.767 --> 48:21.939
...and have come seeking the burial place
of the treasure of the Spanish Mane.

48:22.900 --> 48:27.528
Unfortunately, that makes you thieves...

48:27.696 --> 48:31.991
...and all thieves must first get by...

48:32.784 --> 48:37.204
...my security system.

48:42.461 --> 48:45.630
You do not get to be
the most famous wigmaker in Spain...

48:45.797 --> 48:48.007
...without knowing a little magic.

48:48.175 --> 48:53.471
How else could someone make all those
old guys want to wear long, curly hair?

48:53.639 --> 48:56.015
It looks ridiculous.

48:57.976 --> 49:04.482
Behold, the guardian
of the treasure of the Spanish Mane!

49:16.995 --> 49:21.332
Well, it was the only thing we had
on the ship to model it after.

49:31.551 --> 49:35.471
You did not think I would just
give you the treasure, did you?

49:38.642 --> 49:41.352
Farewell, fools.

51:58.240 --> 52:02.326
So you defeated my guardian?

52:02.661 --> 52:04.745
Well, good for you.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.373
But I bet you did not bring back...

52:07.541 --> 52:09.291
...the key.

52:16.758 --> 52:19.093
So you have.

52:19.261 --> 52:21.595
Well, congratulations.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.437
This is the lock to the door.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.607
You may only enter
if you can figure out the puzzle...

52:33.775 --> 52:36.569
...of how the key opens it.

52:37.237 --> 52:40.739
And you'll have to be very crafty indeed...

52:40.907 --> 52:43.534
...because it won't be...

52:45.036 --> 52:48.539
Okay, yes, I suppose
that was a little obvious.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.710
You have defeated my guardian
and unlocked the door.

52:53.295 --> 52:56.547
Fabulous riches await you within.

52:57.007 --> 53:01.385
Riches beyond your wildest dreams.

53:17.485 --> 53:21.071
I guess he is in too much
of a hurry to hear about...

53:21.239 --> 53:26.660
...the horrible traps
that protect the treasure inside!

53:27.787 --> 53:32.082
Did I forget to mention those?

53:32.250 --> 53:37.004
Well, I do not have a brain,
so it's tough to remember things.

54:04.532 --> 54:05.866
That is right.

54:06.034 --> 54:08.118
The old "trapped, smashing stair...

54:08.286 --> 54:10.996
...that smashes down on you
from the ceiling" trick.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.166
You may as well turn back...

54:14.334 --> 54:17.378
...because the rest of
the stairs are all trapped...

54:17.545 --> 54:21.715
...and there's no way
anybody could possibly...

54:22.133 --> 54:24.343
Hey, what are you doing?

54:32.310 --> 54:35.771
I am fine.
Thanks for asking.

54:41.528 --> 54:42.736
Whew.

55:03.758 --> 55:08.262
Welcome to the Mind Your Memory game.

55:08.722 --> 55:12.016
I am going to show you
an ancient cryptic rune...

55:12.183 --> 55:15.185
...and you are
going to have to memorize it.

55:15.353 --> 55:17.271
Did you catch that?
I hope so.

55:17.689 --> 55:20.733
Because now you have to find it again...

55:20.900 --> 55:23.193
...amongst all these.

55:23.361 --> 55:27.614
Whichever rune you choose,
a door will open to let you out.

55:27.782 --> 55:30.701
But if you choose the wrong rune...

55:30.869 --> 55:34.913
...that lightning rod up there
will zap you but good.

55:36.291 --> 55:37.541
No pressure.

55:37.709 --> 55:40.294
And go.

55:45.467 --> 55:49.678
We have officially started.
Choose a rune.

55:53.725 --> 55:57.644
Today.
Choose a rune today, please.

56:02.317 --> 56:05.736
Got places to be.
Things to do.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.245
Would you just hurry up and...

56:22.045 --> 56:25.923
Well, I said a door would
open after you chose...

56:26.091 --> 56:28.384
...and technically you did choose.

56:28.551 --> 56:32.304
So I guess I cannot
make a liar out of myself now.

56:58.623 --> 57:01.041
Yes, it is true.

57:01.376 --> 57:05.546
All of my fabulous wealth
is now yours for the taking.

57:07.173 --> 57:09.633
So go ahead, take it.

57:09.968 --> 57:14.930
Go on. What are you waiting for?
Take it. It is yours.

57:16.641 --> 57:20.978
What?
You think there is a catch?

57:21.729 --> 57:24.440
Well, you are right.
There is a catch.

57:33.116 --> 57:34.992
If you can get past this...

57:35.160 --> 57:39.621
...the treasure of the
Spanish Mane is all yours.

57:39.789 --> 57:42.124
Fortunately for me, you will not.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.786
That's it?

58:20.330 --> 58:24.333
That is the big climax
to the fabulous treasure hunt?

58:24.501 --> 58:27.503
That is just great.

58:27.670 --> 58:29.630
Fantastic.

58:52.487 --> 58:57.074
You can take the emergency exit.
What do I care?

58:58.451 --> 59:01.453
I guess I do not need a hoard of cash.

59:01.621 --> 59:03.664
It is not like I go out much.

59:03.831 --> 59:07.084
I am a skull, for crying out loud.

59:10.255 --> 59:14.466
Maybe this is the year I finally
turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.450
The treasure.

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:24.161
For the last time, quiet, you.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:32.002
You're even more beautiful in person.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:45.599
I don't suppose you're wearing
all that just to test it out for me?

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:59.321
Or were you thinking of stealing
the treasure for yourself?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.741
Because that would mean I'd have to...

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.243
Oh, my goodness, you're not serious.

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:14.461
Oh, my. Hope you weren't trying
to steal the treasure for yourself.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:19.049
Oh, boy.
You don't wanna know.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:43.323
You treacherous swine,
get your hands off me treasure.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:47.077
Sorry.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.246
Traitorous boar.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:51.998
What do you mean, your treasure?

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.918
Well, some kind of pig.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.838
I can't understand what
you're saying half the time.

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.800
Be gone, you stupid parrot.
I don't need...

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.470
This is at me.

01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:11.101
Okay, fine.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:14.688
Have it your own way.
I quit.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.941
This treasure be mine.

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.652
I got squatter's rights, I have.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.245
Now see here, brother,
this treasure be mine.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.331
And if Bob were here, he'd agree.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.925
Blast, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to prove that.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.280
Excuse me.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.325
Hey, back away from that treasure,
me scurvy brothers.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.330
Gosh, you got me.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:14.915
I'm not sure what he said.

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:18.919
I thought he... You know, the dialect
is different. In this business...

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.632
What?
Me? Fired?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.675
But... But...
Oh, dear.

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:28.595
What will the gals
in the sewing circle think?

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.847
Brother Bob.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.100
Tell Ron the treasure be mine.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:04:01.044
Oh, boy, it's just like the old days.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.815
What the...?

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:52.989
Stop right there!

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:54.866
They got the treasure!

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:03.541
- They've taken the ship.
- Come back here! Come back here!

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.677
So that be the story...

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.723
...of how a trio of pirate brothers
was thwarted out of their treasure...

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.392
...by a cat...

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.814
...and a mouse.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:10.692
Now there's a pirate I could work for?

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.861
The strong silent type.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:18.450
And for once we won't have any trouble
figuring out what he's trying to say.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.041
But it ain't all bad
on the island for us brothers.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:30.920
No, there be plenty of interesting
things to keep us busy.
