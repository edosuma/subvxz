03:44.309 --> 03:45.810
Your shoulder flaring?

03:45.894 --> 03:46.978
No.

03:47.478 --> 03:48.688
You winced.

03:48.771 --> 03:49.772
I didn't wince.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.441
You grimaced.

03:52.817 --> 03:55.069
My shoulder doesn't hurt, Gus.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.453
How long has it been hurting?

04:07.457 --> 04:09.876
Perry wants me
to start tomorrow.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.962
You got to be kidding.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.089
You're not doing it.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.385
No way. It's the end
of a shitty season.

04:19.469 --> 04:20.720
I'm gonna talk to Perry.

04:20.803 --> 04:24.390
Sit down, sit down. Relax.

04:24.474 --> 04:26.225
Sir, drink?

04:26.309 --> 04:27.560
Thank you.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.813
It's a throwaway, Billy.
It means nothing.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.858
Not to the Red Sox.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.781
If I see you wince
even one time...

04:39.864 --> 04:41.908
Oh, God.

04:44.786 --> 04:47.538
I've got the ugliest wife
in the league.

04:49.624 --> 04:52.543
That hurts.
It hurt my feeling.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.006
Buckle your seat belt.

05:09.686 --> 05:12.647
Are we expecting
Ms. Aubrey this evening?

05:12.730 --> 05:14.023
We are.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.192
What name
am I registered under?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.777
Mike Nelson.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.279
The <i>Sea Hunt</i> fellow,
you know.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.698
All right.

05:21.781 --> 05:26.202
Tell the desk that I don't
want to talk to anybody
except her, all right?

05:26.285 --> 05:31.332
Fitch, tonight,
everything has to be perfect.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.418
Have I ever let you down,
Mr. Chapel?

06:04.365 --> 06:07.243
This is Mr. Chapel.
Have there been any messages?

06:08.244 --> 06:09.287
No?

06:11.414 --> 06:12.665
Thanks.

06:31.851 --> 06:34.395
<i>Hi, this is Jane.
Leave a message</i>

06:34.479 --> 06:37.315
<i>and I'll get back to you.
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:39.817
Jane, it's Billy.
I'm worried now,

06:40.777 --> 06:41.778
so please call.

06:45.281 --> 06:46.783
Are you there?

07:50.471 --> 07:53.307
Jesus. I've been banging
out here forever.

07:56.227 --> 07:58.521
What the hell happened to you?

08:00.398 --> 08:02.316
You weren't at the gym.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.570
Is Jane here?

08:05.653 --> 08:06.946
No.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.243
Jesus.

08:18.124 --> 08:20.710
Chap, a lot of little bottles
makes a big bottle.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.129
Hey. That could be her.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.090
You got to throw today, chief.

08:26.174 --> 08:29.093
Gus, do me a favor,
all right. Get the door.

08:31.971 --> 08:33.597
Throw some water
on your hair.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.265
It might look like
you took a shower.

08:41.898 --> 08:44.734
No, not at all. He's in
the bathroom back there.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.907
Mr. Wheeler.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.910
Good morning, Billy.
Got a minute?

08:53.993 --> 08:55.369
Yeah, sure.

08:57.622 --> 08:59.624
Not easy to get up here.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.792
They treat me right.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.461
They didn't have you
on the register.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.004
I can't remember
all your names.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.088
Price of fame, huh?

09:09.050 --> 09:10.301
Can I get you something?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.178
No.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.763
Let's just sit.

09:18.059 --> 09:20.102
It's been a rough season.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.980
Yeah.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.190
Always next year.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.274
Not for me.

09:27.235 --> 09:30.446
It's one of those secrets
everybody knows.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.698
What you don't know is
it's official.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.577
Billy, I sold the Tigers.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.046
Well, that's great.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.547
Is it?

09:52.969 --> 09:58.724
Billy, you've been the heart
and soul of this team.

09:58.808 --> 10:00.268
Like family.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.980
All the negotiations,

10:04.355 --> 10:05.940
the bastards
never said a word.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.861
Said what?

10:13.614 --> 10:16.242
They want to trade you
to the Giants.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.170
Wow!

10:32.258 --> 10:33.509
Is that why you're here?

10:33.592 --> 10:34.593
No.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.097
I don't know how to say this.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.851
You know, I've been
watching you for 18 years.

10:43.060 --> 10:48.107
Nothing has given me
more pleasure.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.277
You're like the old boys.
They were golden.

10:52.111 --> 10:53.696
They had that special pride.

10:55.031 --> 10:57.033
When they were done,
they were done.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.702
Nobody had to
show them the door.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.960
Are you saying
I should retire?

11:08.044 --> 11:10.212
Why not?

11:10.296 --> 11:11.922
It wouldn't hurt
the negotiations,

11:12.048 --> 11:14.050
and it'd serve
those sons of bitches right.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.559
I don't know what to say.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.479
You can't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

11:26.562 --> 11:30.900
And you've been smart
with money, right? Right?

11:36.405 --> 11:38.741
I've always been a Tiger.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.785
I know, son.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.080
That's why this is killing me.

11:47.917 --> 11:51.754
You know, my dad bought
this team when I was seven.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.048
I grew up watching the Tigers.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.841
I was gonna leave the team
to my kids,

11:55.925 --> 11:57.718
but they don't
even like baseball.

11:58.094 --> 11:59.970
Everything's changed, Billy.

12:00.096 --> 12:04.266
The players, the fans,
TV rights and arbitrations.

12:04.350 --> 12:07.269
It isn't the same.
The game stinks, and I...

12:08.646 --> 12:11.190
...I can't be
a part of it anymore.

12:22.076 --> 12:24.120
Billy, you want me to...

12:25.496 --> 12:26.580
No.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.255
Hello? Jane.

12:34.338 --> 12:38.259
Where are you?
You're downstairs?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.594
No. Just stay there,
all right?

12:40.678 --> 12:43.139
Just stay where you're at.
I'm on my way down.

12:43.848 --> 12:45.391
What do you want me
to tell them, Billy?

12:45.474 --> 12:47.977
Look, I need more time.
All right?

12:57.278 --> 12:59.238
The game doesn't stink,
Mr. Wheeler.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.490
It's a great game.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.788
Billy, what's up?

13:12.168 --> 13:14.295
I tried to get her
in a cab, Mr. Chapel,

13:14.378 --> 13:18.257
but she said she wanted
to just go and walk
across Central Park.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.342
Go easy
on our boys today, Billy.

13:47.328 --> 13:50.331
Jane, why didn't you wait?

13:52.541 --> 13:54.043
Are you crying?

14:02.343 --> 14:03.427
What's the matter?

14:03.511 --> 14:07.306
They didn't have any Kleenex
in the hotel bathroom.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.225
What's going on, Jane?

14:09.308 --> 14:13.270
I've been sitting in the lobby
for the last two hours.

14:13.354 --> 14:14.730
Doing what?

14:16.982 --> 14:19.318
I'm sorry
I didn't call last night.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.403
I could tell that your voice
was worried and I...

14:21.487 --> 14:23.614
If something's wrong,
just say it, Jane.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.990
I mean, we don't...

14:25.908 --> 14:27.910
We never had to fake it.

14:32.081 --> 14:35.834
I'm leaving.
I'm going to London.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.925
London?

14:43.008 --> 14:47.846
There's a job. A good job.
An editor's position.

14:47.930 --> 14:52.101
And I've been trying to figure
out a way to tell you,

14:52.184 --> 14:54.353
but everything sounds so...

14:56.605 --> 15:00.776
What can I say?
Tell me what to say.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.740
I can't tell you, Billy.

15:09.368 --> 15:12.621
It's all right. I knew it.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.208
The day I met you
five years ago.
What?

15:16.292 --> 15:17.334
You knew what?

15:17.418 --> 15:18.711
You don't need me.

15:20.421 --> 15:23.632
You and the ball and
the diamond, you're perfect.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.093
A perfectly beautiful thing.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.138
You can win or lose the game
all by yourself.

15:33.601 --> 15:34.935
I'm sorry.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.147
I'm so sorry.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.901
Have dinner tonight with me,
Jane, after the game.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.155
We'll go to Mario's.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.282
I have a 6:00 plane.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.703
They wanted me there
a week ago when you called,

15:52.786 --> 15:54.204
and I wanted to see you.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.790
I wanted to say goodbye.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.836
Goodbye, Billy.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.787
<i>Welcome to New York
and to Yankee Stadium</i>

16:34.870 --> 16:38.248
<i>on a crisp and glorious
fall afternoon</i>

16:38.332 --> 16:41.085
<i>where the Yankees try
to win the divisional title</i>

16:41.168 --> 16:43.337
<i>against the Detroit Tigers.</i>

16:43.420 --> 16:46.006
Hi, everybody. I'm Vin Scully,
along with Steve Lyons,

16:46.090 --> 16:49.051
and welcome to our final telecast
of the regular season.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.762
<i>You can smell the fall.</i>

16:51.845 --> 16:54.723
<i>The World Series is
just around the corner.</i>

17:01.563 --> 17:02.940
Mr. Chapel?

17:05.983 --> 17:10.906
Hey. Ken Strout. I was
your batboy a long time ago.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.741
My dad was a Tiger.

17:15.661 --> 17:20.833
Joe Strout. I remember.
How's he doing?

17:20.915 --> 17:23.252
Good. He and Ma are living
in Florida.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.128
He doesn't move
around too easy, though.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.382
He's got bad knees.
You know, a little arthritis.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.343
What? You playing today?

17:31.427 --> 17:33.303
Don't think so.
They just called me up.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.014
Good. Well, good luck to you.

17:36.098 --> 17:39.685
Give your dad my best.
He was a great player.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.812
Oh, thanks. I'll tell him.

17:50.738 --> 17:52.740
<i>Live from
Yankee Stadium in New York,</i>

17:52.823 --> 17:54.908
<i>it's New York
Yankees baseball.</i>

17:54.992 --> 17:57.536
<i>Today, on the next
to last day of the year,</i>

17:57.619 --> 17:59.955
<i>the Yankees have a chance
to clinch the pennant.</i>

18:00.038 --> 18:02.833
<i>To do it, they'll have to beat
Billy Chapel...</i>

18:02.916 --> 18:05.085
Excuse me.
<i>...and the Detroit Tigers.</i>

18:05.169 --> 18:08.380
Excuse me. Could you
turn that off, please?

18:08.464 --> 18:09.840
<i>...as the Yankees are set</i>

18:09.923 --> 18:11.383
<i>to clinch the pennant.</i>
No.

18:11.467 --> 18:12.801
<i>But standing in their way</i>

18:12.885 --> 18:15.262
<i>is the great veteran
right-hander of the Tigers,</i>

18:15.345 --> 18:16.805
<i>Billy Chapel.</i>

18:17.848 --> 18:19.558
Does anybody else know?

18:19.641 --> 18:21.018
No.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.897
Nobody knows nothing.
Not even Perry.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.192
If they knew, that's all
they'd be talking about.

18:31.487 --> 18:33.489
Well, what does Jane say?

18:35.491 --> 18:38.076
Jane's moving to London.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.120
Moving to London? What the...

18:40.746 --> 18:42.956
How are you gonna manage that?

18:43.040 --> 18:44.833
We're not.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.129
Billy...

18:50.923 --> 18:52.674
This ain't your day.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.223
What are you gonna do?

19:02.226 --> 19:03.685
I don't know.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.192
That's Wheeler's nephew.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.113
He sent him down
to get your answer.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.617
Guess he's gonna sit through
the whole game if he has to.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.035
Poor kid.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.039
He doesn't even know
what he's doing here.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.329
<i>Just throw the ball
to the glove, son.</i>

20:04.413 --> 20:05.414
<i>Just play catch.</i>

20:15.674 --> 20:17.175
Now since
you're throwing bullets,

20:17.259 --> 20:19.344
I won't mention
you were an hour late

20:19.428 --> 20:22.222
and I've been trying to figure
out who my pitcher would be

20:22.306 --> 20:23.348
if you didn't show up.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.392
Have I ever not showed?

20:27.144 --> 20:30.480
I mean, in 19 years,
have I ever not showed?

20:32.482 --> 20:33.650
Well, that's true of everyone

20:33.734 --> 20:36.111
till the first time
they don't show.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.864
Billy, I had an idea.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.990
I've pretty much made up
my mind,

20:40.073 --> 20:42.200
but I wanted
to run it by you first.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.370
I want Jimmy to catch today.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.665
I know how you feel about Gus,
but he ain't hitting, Billy.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.959
He ain't hit for a while now.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.633
I haven't said anything,

20:57.716 --> 20:58.842
but we need
the left-handed bat.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.010
I want Gus.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.388
I know. And I'd love to take
one of these goddamn games.

21:03.472 --> 21:04.640
We're not laying down.

21:04.723 --> 21:07.643
We're not gonna be a red carpet
to the Series for these guys.

21:08.936 --> 21:11.813
Gus catches or I don't pitch.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.734
Me and Gus. Nobody else.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.030
I hope you hear me.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.865
Billy, you telling me
how to run this team?

21:21.949 --> 21:24.242
No. But today...

21:25.452 --> 21:28.455
It's me and Gus.
I've never asked you
any other time, okay?

21:29.414 --> 21:30.666
Good.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.459
Glad you agree. Can't argue
about this right now.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.127
Got to warm up.

21:38.674 --> 21:41.218
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a delay.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.553
We're correcting a bit
of a maintenance problem.

21:43.637 --> 21:46.098
So we don't have
a bit of a crash?

21:47.015 --> 21:48.850
Is there someplace I can stay?

21:48.934 --> 21:52.062
Yes. The Premier Lounge is
down there on your right.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.563
Thanks.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.357
<i>As the sun goes down,</i>

21:55.440 --> 21:57.693
<i>it'll actually be an easier
time to hit for both teams.</i>

21:57.776 --> 21:59.945
<i>And now talking
about shadows and sunlight</i>

22:00.028 --> 22:02.447
<i>that might very well
sum up Billy Chapel.</i>

22:02.531 --> 22:05.283
<i>Long has he stood
in the brilliant sunshine</i>

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
<i>in his great 19-year career,</i>

22:07.452 --> 22:11.206
<i>but now, battling back from
an 8 and 11 record this year,</i>

22:11.289 --> 22:13.542
<i>trying to find his way
out of the shadows,</i>

22:13.709 --> 22:14.960
<i>back into the sunlight.</i>

22:15.043 --> 22:18.422
<i>He'll be facing Mike Robinson,
followed by Jonathan Warble</i>

22:18.505 --> 22:19.965
and then Sam Tuttle.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.050
Bottom of the first inning,
no score,

22:22.134 --> 22:23.802
and the Yankees coming up.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.158
What's he looking at?

22:48.618 --> 22:52.873
He's looking at the clouds.

22:54.082 --> 22:57.210
You okay, Chap? Chappie!

22:58.587 --> 22:59.880
You okay?

23:07.596 --> 23:12.976
<i>Catching, Number
27. Gus Sinski. Number 27.</i>

23:13.935 --> 23:16.730
<i>At shortstop, Number 7.</i>

23:16.813 --> 23:18.190
Trying to take my hand off?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.775
Sorry.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.401
Just let me set
for that juice.

23:21.485 --> 23:22.861
Warn me or something.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.656
I'm gonna throw a little
harder than usual today.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.575
There's your warning.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.952
Chap, don't throw it away
too early.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.792
Today I'm throwing hard, Gus.

23:38.126 --> 23:40.504
You and me? One more time?

23:43.256 --> 23:44.508
Why not?

23:57.521 --> 24:00.107
We got you, Chapel!
You're done!

24:00.190 --> 24:02.859
We're gonna stick
a fork in you, Chapel!

24:02.943 --> 24:03.944
You're finished!

24:05.112 --> 24:07.739
You are complete.
The Tigers are done!

24:07.823 --> 24:09.616
You're done! You're finished!

24:09.699 --> 24:11.326
Get out of town!

24:12.494 --> 24:14.496
I can always tell
when I'm in New York.

24:16.206 --> 24:19.000
Chapel! Yo, Chapel!

24:19.751 --> 24:21.002
You suck!

24:22.462 --> 24:26.675
You stink on ice!
You couldn't pitch a tent!

24:40.897 --> 24:42.691
<i>Clear the mechanism.</i>

24:54.411 --> 24:55.871
Hello, Mike.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.669
<i>Strike one!</i>

25:06.381 --> 25:08.383
<i>Chapel working
on Robinson.</i>

25:08.466 --> 25:10.844
<i>Bottom of the first inning,
no score.</i>

25:14.055 --> 25:17.142
<i>And there's a little looper
to JosÃ© Garcia. One away.</i>

25:18.393 --> 25:20.854
This is my lucky day.
How are you?

25:20.937 --> 25:22.939
Fine. How you doing?
What'll you have?

25:23.023 --> 25:25.233
The Bud on tap is good.

25:25.734 --> 25:29.404
This is a beautiful day
for the big ballpark
in the Bronx.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.831
<i>Two solid years, and now
a third with the Yankees.</i>

25:39.915 --> 25:41.666
<i>Pretty good breaking ball.
Did get it up...</i>

25:41.750 --> 25:44.544
A lot of guys would be upset
about missing their flight

25:44.628 --> 25:46.213
you know,
delay this and that,

25:46.296 --> 25:48.131
but this works out
beautiful for me.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.968
<i>Chapel trying
to derail the Yankees</i>

25:52.219 --> 25:54.804
<i>and the Yankees trying
to end a season</i>

25:54.888 --> 25:57.724
<i>that has long been finished
by Detroit.</i>

26:06.775 --> 26:09.319
They pushed this guy up
to pitch this game,

26:09.402 --> 26:12.280
so basically we clinch
today and I get to see it.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.365
Beautiful.

26:16.868 --> 26:18.078
Hi. What can I get for you?

26:18.161 --> 26:20.038
Chivas and water.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.706
Okay, here we go.

26:21.790 --> 26:25.043
Everything is...
Look at that. It's early.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.089
You got nuts, chips? Some?

26:29.172 --> 26:30.215
Got those pretzels.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.549
I can make do.

26:31.633 --> 26:32.968
Thank you.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.680
<i>Good fastball
with some movement on it.</i>

26:36.763 --> 26:39.140
<i>Down goes Warble.</i>
He swung at that?

26:39.224 --> 26:40.892
This guy,
he's got nothing now.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.477
It's like, if I was Boston,
I'd be worried.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.064
I'd be like, "What?
Are you throwing the game?"

26:46.147 --> 26:47.983
This guy used to be a monster,
to tell you the truth.

26:48.066 --> 26:52.737
When he first came up,
unhittable. Now he's a junker.

26:53.488 --> 26:56.533
<i>...three years in a row. In
baseball circles, we all know</i>

26:56.616 --> 26:58.493
<i>that there's no love lost
between these two.</i>

26:58.576 --> 26:59.995
<i>They don't like
each other too much.</i>

27:01.288 --> 27:05.500
<i>At third base,
Number 13, Sam Tuttle.</i>

27:07.961 --> 27:09.337
Sam Tuttle.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.883
I can't think of a better
reason not to be a Yankee.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.262
<i>Sam Tuttle hit. 625.</i>

27:17.345 --> 27:20.056
<i>He went 5 for 8
against Chapel this year.</i>

27:20.140 --> 27:21.766
<i>That would make me
not like a guy.</i>

27:21.850 --> 27:23.893
<i>I would think so.</i>

27:43.330 --> 27:46.458
<i>Fastball on the inside
corner. Strike one.</i>

27:46.541 --> 27:48.335
Wasn't that inside?

27:49.210 --> 27:52.297
Never do swing at
the first pitch, do you, Sam?

27:59.721 --> 28:02.515
No. We're
off the page now, Gus.

28:02.599 --> 28:07.062
This is between
me and Ugly. Straight heat.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.064
Attaboy.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.943
Strike two!

28:14.027 --> 28:15.528
That shit's outside.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.989
No wonder nobody
likes you, Tuttle.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.824
Everything's
a goddamn debate.

28:19.908 --> 28:23.328
<i>Fastball, and it runs
right on that outside corner.</i>

28:23.411 --> 28:25.955
<i>So 0 and 2
the count to Sam Tuttle.</i>

28:26.915 --> 28:30.126
I saw that shitty little
Hollywood movie you did.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.134
Ball!

28:38.218 --> 28:40.387
<i>I guess Sinski
wanted that one.</i>

28:40.470 --> 28:43.014
<i>So did Chap. You
see the reaction on his face.</i>

28:43.098 --> 28:45.016
<i>That's a good pitch
on the outside corner.</i>

28:45.100 --> 28:46.976
<i>Tuttle didn't like
the first two calls,</i>

28:47.060 --> 28:49.145
<i>and now he gets a break
on that outside corner.</i>

28:49.229 --> 28:51.481
<i>That's not the kind of pitch
that Chapel's gonna like</i>

28:51.564 --> 28:53.441
<i>being called
a ball all day long.</i>

28:58.780 --> 29:00.573
Don't crowd me, Sam.

29:01.533 --> 29:03.326
I hate being crowded.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.789
No!

29:07.914 --> 29:09.666
<i>One and two the count,</i>

29:09.749 --> 29:11.543
<i>and Tuttle has really
moved up on the plate.</i>

29:11.626 --> 29:14.129
<i>He's all over
the plate right now.</i>

29:19.676 --> 29:21.511
Now you got the idea.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.060
<i>Down goes Tuttle.</i>

29:29.144 --> 29:30.228
<i>What a knockdown pitch
that was.</i>

29:30.311 --> 29:32.313
<i>There's a message
being delivered.</i>

29:32.397 --> 29:34.732
<i>Yankee Stadium is
like a schoolyard</i>

29:34.816 --> 29:38.027
<i>and Bill Murdie looks like
a teacher who sees trouble.</i>

29:39.028 --> 29:42.031
<i>They say in every great
athlete there's a mean streak</i>

29:42.115 --> 29:44.284
<i>and Billy Chapel's
no different.</i>

29:44.367 --> 29:47.120
<i>Bill Murdie goes
from umpire to referee.</i>

29:47.704 --> 29:49.622
<i>Anytime I played
against this guy,</i>

29:49.706 --> 29:51.124
<i>if he felt like
he had good stuff,</i>

29:51.207 --> 29:52.375
<i>he'd flip you like this.</i>

29:53.001 --> 29:54.919
<i>He'd throw a ball
right over your head</i>

29:55.003 --> 29:57.839
<i>just to let you know,
"I can throw the ball
anywhere I want today."</i>

29:57.922 --> 30:00.758
You know, I've been
a Yankee fan since 1958.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.636
I can name a Yankee
for every number.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.805
Oh, God. Please don't.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.224
Number One: Billy Martin,
Bobby Richardson.

30:08.308 --> 30:12.228
Number Two: Frank "The Crow"
Crosetti and Bobby Murcer.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.314
Number Three: The Babe.
Number Four: Gehrig.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.608
Five: DiMaggio. Six...
Excuse me.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.067
...Clete Boyer, Roy White.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.611
Would you mind?

30:21.488 --> 30:22.947
You can't smoke in a bar.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.532
What, now you can't
talk in a bar?

30:25.408 --> 30:26.451
This ain't church, lady.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.912
<i>Oh, what a restore.
Tuttle back up to the plate.</i>

30:28.995 --> 30:30.288
Two and two!

30:30.371 --> 30:32.749
Same shit, different day?

30:32.832 --> 30:34.459
I'd throw it at you again,

30:34.542 --> 30:37.045
but I'm afraid
Murdie'd run me.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.176
Strike three!

30:43.259 --> 30:44.761
<i>Oh, good breaking ball.</i>

30:44.844 --> 30:46.012
<i>Got him looking.</i>

30:46.095 --> 30:48.431
<i>What a great job
setting up the hitter.</i>

30:48.515 --> 30:49.474
<i>Let's take
another look.</i>

30:49.557 --> 30:51.809
<i>Tuttle looks like a deer
caught in the headlights.</i>

30:51.893 --> 30:53.311
<i>Chapel jelly-legged him.</i>

30:53.394 --> 30:54.687
<i>So at the end of one,</i>

30:54.771 --> 30:56.648
<i>Tigers nothing,
Yankees nothing.</i>

30:56.731 --> 30:58.274
All right. Here we go now.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.985
Four, five, six. Let's get
something started.

31:01.069 --> 31:04.614
JosÃ©, atta-baby. It's all
about positioning. All right?

31:05.907 --> 31:07.700
You got to wait on this guy.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.744
Mike, can I have some water?

31:09.827 --> 31:10.995
Sure thing, Billy.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.622
You all right?

31:16.209 --> 31:18.545
You got it going good
out there.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.965
Make sure you save something.

31:27.595 --> 31:30.098
Birch wants
to play golf tomorrow.

31:34.018 --> 31:37.480
You know, I played golf
with Birch the day I met Jane.

31:39.023 --> 31:40.316
You doing all right?

31:42.318 --> 31:43.861
Yeah.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.949
I'm not hearing them
at all out there.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.941
Yeah, that'll fix it.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.514
I don't need any help.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.852
I can see that.
I can see you got your car

32:57.977 --> 33:00.229
kicked completely
into submission.

33:00.313 --> 33:02.315
I mean it. Just go away.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.028
I can always tell
when I'm in New York.

33:10.198 --> 33:12.909
Do you really know
anything about cars?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.293
You want me to have
a look at it?

33:22.377 --> 33:25.922
Okay. It's not mine.
It's just a trashy rental.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.841
Yeah. Mine, too.

33:34.222 --> 33:37.767
Why don't you try the key, see
if we can't get it started.

33:42.188 --> 33:45.233
I should've paid attention
in auto shop. Ouch.

33:59.622 --> 34:02.125
What did you do?
Well, I was...

34:02.208 --> 34:05.253
I have no idea. I don't...

34:05.336 --> 34:07.088
I don't know anything
about cars.

34:07.171 --> 34:10.341
I was just trying
to be manly.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.511
That was great, thank you.
You saved my day.

34:13.594 --> 34:17.098
Of course I did.
I said I would.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.518
Where you headed?

34:20.601 --> 34:22.728
I'm not sure.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.188
Bear Mountain, maybe.

34:24.272 --> 34:26.524
I just threw my stuff
in the car and took off.

34:26.607 --> 34:27.692
Had to get out of the city.

34:27.775 --> 34:28.860
How come?

34:28.943 --> 34:30.945
'Cause summer's over
and I missed it.

34:32.071 --> 34:35.616
I work all the time. It makes
me feel old. I don't know.

34:40.788 --> 34:41.831
Oh!

34:44.000 --> 34:45.793
Well, thanks again.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.049
So, what's the problem?

34:52.132 --> 34:54.427
My problem seems
to be solved.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.012
Oh, no.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.097
Wait a second.
The car's fine.

34:58.181 --> 34:59.390
Yeah, but listen, honey.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.226
I gave up on four calls
hauling my ass out to you.

35:02.310 --> 35:03.853
Okay? That's $100 to me,

35:03.936 --> 35:05.897
so if nothing's wrong
with this car now

35:05.980 --> 35:08.566
there will be when I bring it
down to the city. Okay?

35:08.649 --> 35:09.734
Everything all right?

35:09.817 --> 35:12.195
Everything's
peaches, mac.

35:19.786 --> 35:22.079
You're Billy Chapel.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.706
I can't believe it.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.667
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I can't believe this.

35:27.251 --> 35:28.795
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.674
You know, you're the greatest
freaking ballplayer out there.

35:33.758 --> 35:36.135
I'm sorry.
But you really are.

35:36.219 --> 35:39.680
I'm gonna go get that.
You stay right here, okay?

35:42.350 --> 35:44.143
Billy Chapel.

35:44.227 --> 35:46.646
Nice to meet you.
Jane Aubrey.

35:48.523 --> 35:51.359
You know, I got this problem.

35:51.442 --> 35:54.695
See, I'd like to keep
talking with you,

35:54.779 --> 35:56.781
but I got to go to work.

36:00.493 --> 36:01.953
Just a sec. Hey!

36:04.205 --> 36:06.165
I'll get there
when I get there.

36:06.249 --> 36:08.584
Can you do me a favor?
Anything.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.169
We got a bum deal
on this rental here,

36:10.253 --> 36:11.921
so if you could...

36:12.004 --> 36:14.048
If you could haul this
back to town for us,

36:14.131 --> 36:15.675
I'd really appreciate it.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.385
I can't take that.

36:17.468 --> 36:20.388
Wait a second.
What are you doing?

36:21.472 --> 36:23.307
You like baseball?
What?

36:23.391 --> 36:24.392
Baseball.

36:24.475 --> 36:25.852
No, not really. Hey...

36:25.935 --> 36:27.812
You ever been?

36:27.895 --> 36:29.063
No.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.982
Would you like to go?

36:33.442 --> 36:36.487
Would you like to go
to a baseball game with me?

36:36.571 --> 36:39.365
Billy, if she don't
want to go, I'll go.

36:40.867 --> 36:42.743
Don't let that happen.

37:02.972 --> 37:05.975
Lady, you can't just stand
in the middle like that.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.143
Oh. Sorry.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.186
Let me see your ticket.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.106
You're with the players'
wives. Follow me.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.908
Thanks. Excuse me.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.785
Sorry. Sorry.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.164
Hey there, excuse me.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.999
Who are you here with, honey?

37:30.082 --> 37:31.667
Billy Chapel.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.294
Oh, how nice.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.633
This week's blonde.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.102
No, stay.
You're cool. Trust me.

37:50.186 --> 37:51.938
I've been there, all right?

37:52.021 --> 37:53.731
I'm Kisha Birch.

37:53.814 --> 37:54.815
Hi.
Hi.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.442
Jane Aubrey.
Nice to meet you.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.277
Strike three!

38:08.120 --> 38:09.997
You got a ball?
Yeah.

38:19.256 --> 38:21.759
You don't lose much, do you?

38:21.884 --> 38:23.719
I lose. I've lost.

38:25.346 --> 38:29.392
About 134 times.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.685
Oh!

38:32.353 --> 38:34.772
That's over, like,
15 years, okay?

38:34.855 --> 38:36.357
Oh!

38:36.440 --> 38:38.651
You count them?

38:38.734 --> 38:40.945
We count everything
in baseball. I mean,

38:41.529 --> 38:43.280
God, that's all we do.

38:45.199 --> 38:47.410
All right, quit stalling.

38:47.493 --> 38:48.661
What?

38:48.744 --> 38:52.248
You haven't told me
anything about you. Nothing.

38:52.331 --> 38:55.292
I figured if I kept
my mouth shut,

38:55.376 --> 38:57.920
I could pass
for elegant and mysterious.

38:58.004 --> 39:00.256
You're forgetting
I saw you on the highway,

39:00.965 --> 39:03.384
kicking the hell out
of your car.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.180
Where are you from?

39:08.264 --> 39:09.265
Oh, God.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.062
Three questions.

39:15.146 --> 39:17.356
Syracuse, New York.
That's one.

39:22.278 --> 39:24.613
What are the pads for?

39:24.697 --> 39:28.075
This one is my article on
lip gloss for <i>Elle</i> magazine

39:28.159 --> 39:31.245
this one is on skin peels,
and my grocery list.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.709
Last question.

39:42.798 --> 39:45.051
How do you like to be kissed?

39:50.598 --> 39:53.392
You know, I've always thought

39:53.476 --> 39:56.687
that men and women should
just carry around signs.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.814
You know, if you're poor
and you can't afford it,

39:58.898 --> 40:01.692
you would make yours
out of cardboard and string.

40:01.776 --> 40:04.612
And if you're rich, you could
have it lettered in gold leaf

40:04.695 --> 40:07.615
or pounded out of tin
by Mexican craftsmen,

40:07.698 --> 40:08.866
it doesn't matter.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.327
But you wear them
around your neck. See?

40:11.410 --> 40:15.706
And they say things
like "shallow" or "horny."

40:15.790 --> 40:19.752
It just would be
a hell of a lot easier.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.798
What would yours say?

40:51.492 --> 40:53.953
Billy, isn't this your floor?

40:54.036 --> 40:55.663
I think so.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.998
We've been here twice before.

41:15.349 --> 41:17.059
Good morning.

41:17.143 --> 41:18.602
Good morning.

41:20.062 --> 41:21.438
Got to go.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.150
Sleep as long as you want.

41:24.233 --> 41:26.152
You can take a shower,
anything you want.

41:26.277 --> 41:29.280
Nobody'll bother you
till you take the sign
off the door.

41:29.363 --> 41:30.865
Okay. Thanks.

41:32.283 --> 41:34.285
What's this? A souvenir?

41:35.536 --> 41:37.121
It's my number.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.668
Billy, you don't have
to give me this.

41:42.751 --> 41:47.631
I know I don't have
to do this, but I wanted to.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.806
When will you be back?

41:55.890 --> 41:57.224
I already checked.

41:57.308 --> 42:00.519
Four weeks from Thursday I'll
be back in New York, so...

42:01.979 --> 42:03.564
That Thursday night

42:04.481 --> 42:07.234
meet me in the bar
downstairs at 10:00, okay?

42:08.194 --> 42:10.446
I'll be there waiting for you.

42:12.031 --> 42:13.490
If you don't show up,

42:13.574 --> 42:16.368
if you leave me standing
in that bar, it'll ruin this.

42:16.911 --> 42:19.997
Well, then I guess
I'll just have to show up.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.665
I'm serious.

42:22.750 --> 42:25.252
I'll be there, Jane, okay?

42:26.086 --> 42:27.922
Okay, Billy Chapel.

42:51.570 --> 42:56.992
Birch, baby! Kiss that bitch
goodbye! Take it over!

42:58.744 --> 43:00.496
Clear the mechanism.

43:15.135 --> 43:16.929
You look old, Davis.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.015
Are we that old?

43:27.273 --> 43:29.566
<i>And the fastball
sinks at the knees,</i>

43:29.650 --> 43:31.735
<i>picks up the corner
and the count 0 and 1.</i>

43:31.819 --> 43:34.029
Don't smile at me, Davis.
I hate that.

43:34.113 --> 43:36.240
<i>It was a sad day in Detroit</i>

43:36.323 --> 43:38.575
<i>when Gary Wheeler,
the owner of the Tigers</i>

43:38.659 --> 43:40.911
<i>and a somewhat
beleaguered franchise,</i>

43:40.995 --> 43:44.498
<i>was forced to trade Davis
Birch, who was a free agent.</i>

43:44.581 --> 43:47.418
<i>Detroit could not come up
with his monetary demands.</i>

43:47.501 --> 43:51.255
<i>The Yankees were waiting with
open arms and an open wallet.</i>

43:51.839 --> 43:53.757
It was your team, too.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.845
I mean, how much money
we got to make?

43:57.928 --> 44:00.222
You want to see my team?

44:00.723 --> 44:02.599
Let's go play.
That's my team over there.

44:02.683 --> 44:06.103
You got it. I'll be out
in a second, okay?

44:06.186 --> 44:08.355
Billy, are you gonna just
sit there and mope

44:08.439 --> 44:10.274
or are you gonna help?

44:16.155 --> 44:19.700
I ain't carrying no books.
Where's the pillows?

44:26.540 --> 44:28.625
You're the best, kiddo.

44:29.084 --> 44:31.378
The best around.
The worthy opponent.

44:35.341 --> 44:36.967
<i>The 0-1 pitch,</i>

44:37.051 --> 44:39.428
<i>and the bottom just drops
out of it. Strike two.</i>

44:39.511 --> 44:42.014
<i>Look at Birch staring
out at Chapel saying,</i>

44:42.097 --> 44:43.390
<i>"Where's that curveball
coming from?</i>

44:43.474 --> 44:47.061
<i>"You never had that curveball
when we played together."</i>

44:53.192 --> 44:57.029
It don't happen that often,
but I got you mixed up,
don't I?

44:59.990 --> 45:02.368
You're guessing now,
aren't you?

45:04.203 --> 45:06.663
Well, here's your fastball.

45:06.747 --> 45:09.500
Right down the pipe so
you don't walk away thinking

45:09.917 --> 45:11.752
I was afraid
to give it to you.

45:13.379 --> 45:14.380
Strike!

45:14.463 --> 45:17.049
<i>Fastball runs
on the inside corner.</i>

45:17.132 --> 45:18.842
<i>Strike three called.</i>

45:18.926 --> 45:20.844
Jesus, Birch,
I could've hit that.

45:20.928 --> 45:22.805
<i>So, Billy Chapel
all business,</i>

45:22.888 --> 45:24.848
<i>taking care of Birch
on three pitches.</i>

45:24.932 --> 45:26.934
<i>Lenny Howell will follow.</i>

45:28.894 --> 45:30.562
<i>If you don't show up,</i>

45:30.646 --> 45:33.315
<i>if you leave me standing
in that bar, it'll ruin this.</i>

45:52.000 --> 45:53.627
Cab, Mr. Chapel?

45:58.966 --> 46:00.926
You leaving?

46:01.009 --> 46:04.555
Yeah, I was supposed
to meet someone, but they...

46:04.638 --> 46:07.266
I'm sorry.
I wasn't gonna come.

46:07.349 --> 46:08.934
I actually sat
in my apartment,

46:09.017 --> 46:10.144
counting the hours
to the time

46:10.227 --> 46:14.148
when I was not gonna show up
to meet you and then I just...

46:14.940 --> 46:16.358
Oh, God.

46:18.485 --> 46:20.529
Billy Chapel.

46:20.612 --> 46:23.490
Why do you always use
both my names?

46:23.574 --> 46:25.534
So I know
what I'm up against.

46:25.617 --> 46:28.120
I had a great time with you
last month.

46:28.203 --> 46:30.122
It's not that.
Don't get me wrong.

46:30.205 --> 46:32.249
It's just that...

46:32.332 --> 46:35.627
I don't mean to sound like
anything or anything.

46:35.711 --> 46:39.756
But, but I don't do that.

46:39.882 --> 46:41.508
And I'm not saying
anything about it.
What?

46:41.550 --> 46:44.511
I just don't do it,
not since college.
What don't you do?

46:44.595 --> 46:46.263
I just... You know what?

46:46.346 --> 46:48.432
I think I should go home.
Why?

46:48.515 --> 46:51.226
Because I just don't
screw like that!

46:52.186 --> 46:54.938
And I hate that word.

46:55.022 --> 46:56.440
You want the cab,
Mr. Chapel?

46:56.523 --> 46:57.941
Give it to somebody else.

46:58.025 --> 47:01.987
I don't go to hotel rooms
with men I don't know.

47:02.070 --> 47:03.447
Billy, I can't be a groupie.

47:03.530 --> 47:04.781
You're not a groupie, Jane.

47:04.865 --> 47:07.034
You don't look like one
or act like one.

47:07.117 --> 47:08.368
I didn't treat you like one.

47:13.248 --> 47:14.458
Wasn't I a gentleman?

47:14.541 --> 47:16.043
Yes, I know.

47:16.126 --> 47:18.462
But you pull up
out of nowhere,

47:18.545 --> 47:20.881
you start my car,
you make me laugh

47:20.964 --> 47:22.549
and the next thing I know,

47:22.841 --> 47:25.969
I'm at a baseball game
that you win!

47:26.053 --> 47:28.555
I mean, it's so surreal.

47:28.639 --> 47:32.434
Little boys buy cards
with your picture on them.

47:32.518 --> 47:34.645
They buy those for the gum.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.484
God damn it!

47:40.567 --> 47:41.818
What?

47:42.778 --> 47:44.571
God damn what?

47:45.572 --> 47:46.990
I like you.

47:49.284 --> 47:51.328
So what's the problem?

47:51.411 --> 47:54.873
I'm really not at all
the person you think I am.

47:54.957 --> 47:58.085
And I think it would just be
more fair for both of us

47:58.460 --> 48:00.420
for me to just leave.

48:02.881 --> 48:05.425
Well, forget it.

48:09.930 --> 48:14.768
What's the difference?
I mean... What? No.

48:15.102 --> 48:17.521
Here, give me the thing.

48:17.604 --> 48:20.566
What's the difference
between the real you

48:20.899 --> 48:22.693
and this other you?

48:22.818 --> 48:25.654
The real me is...

48:26.947 --> 48:28.949
The real me is plain,

48:29.032 --> 48:32.327
uninteresting and hates
sexy underwear

48:32.411 --> 48:34.871
because it's really
uncomfortable.

48:39.126 --> 48:41.461
All right.
So, the real you is a bummer.

48:41.545 --> 48:45.090
This can't be what you were
looking for from this evening.

48:45.173 --> 48:47.759
Be totally honest with me.

48:47.843 --> 48:51.555
That day I fixed your car,
Jane, I got lucky.

48:51.638 --> 48:53.890
And maybe you got lucky, too.

48:54.808 --> 48:59.229
I mean, I know we don't
know each other so well,

48:59.313 --> 49:02.774
but that's what I was hoping.

49:02.858 --> 49:07.112
I mean, we don't have to...
We could, like, walk.

49:07.195 --> 49:10.741
I mean, we could walk like...
We can just walk.

49:10.824 --> 49:11.992
Walk?

49:13.952 --> 49:15.454
I could walk.

49:18.540 --> 49:21.418
We don't have to talk
so much either.

49:21.501 --> 49:22.502
Okay.

49:49.112 --> 49:50.739
Border collie.

49:52.783 --> 49:54.993
My dad loved
the Blue Heelers.

49:55.077 --> 49:56.662
Is he still alive?

49:57.204 --> 49:59.039
No, they're both gone.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.918
Him first,
and then her within a year.

50:06.088 --> 50:07.381
He was a good man.

50:08.215 --> 50:11.009
Very tall. Very reserved.

50:11.718 --> 50:14.554
Passionately in love
with two things,

50:15.222 --> 50:18.642
my mother and baseball.

50:18.725 --> 50:20.686
Then he was a lucky man.

50:23.605 --> 50:24.731
Okay.

50:29.069 --> 50:30.153
Okay.

50:34.408 --> 50:39.579
So, how do we do this?
How does this work, Billy?

50:39.663 --> 50:40.747
I told you,

50:40.872 --> 50:43.375
I have to be here next month
for a couple of days.

50:43.458 --> 50:45.252
I want to see you.

50:45.335 --> 50:46.753
Okay.

50:47.379 --> 50:48.505
Okay.

50:52.426 --> 50:55.929
So, when you're away

50:56.012 --> 50:59.474
I'll live my life
and you'll live yours.

50:59.808 --> 51:03.687
And none of this stupid, bullshit,
why-didn't-you-call-me crap.

51:03.770 --> 51:05.689
And what you do
when you're not with me

51:05.772 --> 51:08.358
has nothing to do with me,
and vice versa.

51:08.442 --> 51:13.780
No questions asked.
No worrying. No obsessing.

51:17.367 --> 51:19.202
That sounded perfect.

51:21.455 --> 51:23.123
Good night.
Good night.

51:55.322 --> 51:57.908
My back keeps breaking out.

51:57.991 --> 52:00.577
Candy says it's gross.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.204
Use the loofah.

52:03.413 --> 52:05.457
The what?

52:05.540 --> 52:08.001
The loofah. It exfoliates.

52:09.419 --> 52:11.755
You're losing it
over this girl.

52:17.010 --> 52:20.222
I met this woman in New York.

52:20.305 --> 52:22.682
I'm thinking
of asking her down.

52:23.850 --> 52:25.101
Call her.

52:25.185 --> 52:28.063
No, you know,
it's not... It's casual.

52:29.272 --> 52:31.900
I've seen her a few times
over the winter in New York

52:31.983 --> 52:33.860
when I happened to be there.

52:35.278 --> 52:36.571
Call her.

52:45.372 --> 52:46.790
Hello?

52:46.873 --> 52:50.919
<i>I'm having this problem
with my skin peel.</i>

52:52.212 --> 52:53.505
I was just thinking about you.

52:53.588 --> 52:55.257
<i>Yeah? What were you thinking?</i>

52:55.340 --> 52:58.802
<i>I was wondering when
you play your first series
against the Yankees.</i>

52:58.885 --> 53:00.303
Jane, come down here.

53:00.387 --> 53:01.471
<i>What?</i>

53:01.555 --> 53:02.639
Come see me.

53:02.722 --> 53:04.391
Come spend the weekend.
Meet my friends.

53:04.474 --> 53:06.226
I don't know, Billy.

53:06.309 --> 53:08.687
<i>What do you mean,
you don't know?</i>

53:08.770 --> 53:12.274
I've got a ton of work to do,
and you know,

53:12.399 --> 53:15.110
I can't afford
to be running off...
<i>So I'll pay.</i>

53:15.193 --> 53:16.236
No.

53:17.779 --> 53:19.281
It's not that.

53:20.991 --> 53:22.409
Look, we made the rules.

53:22.492 --> 53:23.743
I think we should
stick to them.

53:23.827 --> 53:26.621
There's no rules about having
fun. I mean, that's bullshit.

53:26.705 --> 53:28.248
<i>Why is it bullshit?</i>

53:28.331 --> 53:31.209
Because if all you wanna do
is have fun, then you would
come here down here

53:31.293 --> 53:33.336
'cause this is fun.

53:33.420 --> 53:35.422
You know who sat
in the bleachers last Sunday?

53:35.505 --> 53:37.465
<i>Who?</i>

53:37.549 --> 53:38.717
Sandy Koufax.

53:39.175 --> 53:41.386
You are such a...
Sandy Koufax.

53:41.469 --> 53:44.347
You are such a guy.
You are like the ultimate guy.

53:44.431 --> 53:45.515
What? You don't like guys?

53:45.599 --> 53:46.975
I need a regular guy,

53:47.058 --> 53:49.060
not the guy on
the Old Spice commercial.

53:49.144 --> 53:50.562
It was Right Guard.

53:50.645 --> 53:51.771
<i>What?</i>

53:52.814 --> 53:55.525
It was Right Guard,
that commercial.

53:55.609 --> 53:58.695
I was being
metaphorical, Billy.

53:58.778 --> 54:01.573
Look, this is crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

54:01.656 --> 54:04.492
I'm supposed to run down
there and meet Sandy Koufax,

54:04.576 --> 54:07.120
get his autograph and sleep
with Mr. Right Guard?

54:07.203 --> 54:09.289
What are you so afraid of?

54:09.372 --> 54:10.749
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

54:12.542 --> 54:15.003
<i>I can't be a groupie.</i>

54:15.086 --> 54:18.757
You know, that's
the second time you used
that word to me, Jane,

54:18.840 --> 54:21.843
<i>and it didn't really go down
that well the first time.</i>

54:21.968 --> 54:23.053
Now you're mad.

54:23.136 --> 54:26.556
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just pissed off.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.641
<i>Billy, that's not fair.</i>

54:27.724 --> 54:30.060
I'm gonna hang up now,
all right?
<i>Let's just start from...</i>

54:30.143 --> 54:31.227
I'll call you another time.

54:31.311 --> 54:34.064
Wait. No.
When will you call me?

54:34.147 --> 54:36.775
<i>Like, when I don't feel
like killing you.</i>

54:42.739 --> 54:44.115
I told her.

54:45.867 --> 54:49.371
So, I haven't seen you
around much lately.

54:50.830 --> 54:52.749
I've been working hard.

54:52.832 --> 54:56.628
Yeah, well.
All work and no play.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.364
All I've got is
my toothbrush

55:24.447 --> 55:26.616
and a bathing suit
I bought at the airport.

55:30.537 --> 55:34.165
You're not smiling.
You're annoyed.
No.

55:34.249 --> 55:35.625
I'm an idiot.

55:35.709 --> 55:37.752
No, I'm an idiot.

55:38.420 --> 55:40.046
Jane, listen to me.

55:40.130 --> 55:43.800
No matter what happens
in the next five minutes,

55:43.883 --> 55:48.263
I want you to know
that when I opened this door

55:48.346 --> 55:51.349
I was so happy to see you
that my heart leapt.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.979
It leapt in my chest. Okay?

55:58.231 --> 55:59.482
Okay.

55:59.566 --> 56:01.943
Hey, Billy,
can I borrow your...

56:02.902 --> 56:04.279
Blow dryer?

56:15.415 --> 56:16.750
Don't go.

56:22.380 --> 56:24.049
It's not your...

56:26.468 --> 56:27.469
Jane!

56:27.552 --> 56:30.513
I have terrible timing.
I've always had it.

56:30.597 --> 56:33.433
You know, that's why
I failed at acting

56:33.600 --> 56:36.144
and skiing and table tennis.

56:36.227 --> 56:39.689
I should have known when
the only flight to Lauderdale

56:39.773 --> 56:41.232
was at 6:10 a.m.

56:41.316 --> 56:43.860
and the only rental car
I could get

56:43.943 --> 56:45.862
was this ridiculous Lincoln.

56:45.945 --> 56:50.033
The car is perfect.
It's perfect.

56:50.116 --> 56:51.701
That girl...

56:51.785 --> 56:55.371
Please. You don't have to do
this. I'm not angry or hurt.

56:55.455 --> 56:57.415
We're not anything.
You're fine.

56:57.499 --> 57:00.001
You can do whatever you want.
I know I can do... I just...

57:00.085 --> 57:01.127
I don't want her.

57:01.211 --> 57:03.421
Then what is she doing here?

57:04.672 --> 57:07.342
Well, I like her.
She's my masseuse.

57:13.807 --> 57:17.352
It's never quite
how you play it in your head.

57:19.521 --> 57:22.232
What about the whole
deal thing?

57:22.315 --> 57:23.441
What deal?

57:23.525 --> 57:26.569
You know, you do what you do,
I do what I do.

57:26.653 --> 57:28.154
You believed that?

57:28.238 --> 57:31.074
I was lying.
I was trying to be the man.

57:31.157 --> 57:33.201
And I was doing
a damn good job of it

57:33.284 --> 57:35.662
until you invited me
down here.

57:38.248 --> 57:39.833
You were right.

57:42.585 --> 57:44.379
I was afraid.

57:44.462 --> 57:46.506
I was afraid you were
gonna break my heart

57:46.589 --> 57:49.092
into 1,000 pieces.

57:50.260 --> 57:52.011
I'm sorry. Jane.

57:59.477 --> 58:02.021
I've been thinking
about you, Jane.

58:03.648 --> 58:06.401
I don't know what I was...
That was a...

58:08.987 --> 58:11.739
All right, tell me what I can
say so you'll believe me.

58:11.823 --> 58:13.366
I believe you.

58:15.451 --> 58:17.078
Then stay.

58:17.162 --> 58:19.372
Please, Jane.
I want you to stay.

58:19.455 --> 58:22.083
This can only end bloody
for me, Billy.

58:23.543 --> 58:26.546
I saved the sign.
You know the "yes" sign?

58:26.629 --> 58:29.883
I pinned it on the wall
in my locker. God damn it!

58:31.426 --> 58:32.927
It was stupid!

58:35.221 --> 58:36.973
<i>Strike three called.</i>

58:37.891 --> 58:39.392
<i>On the corner.</i>

58:41.102 --> 58:43.062
Strike three!
<i>Fastball, got him looking.</i>

58:43.146 --> 58:45.565
<i>That's strikeout number five
for Billy Chapel</i>

58:45.648 --> 58:47.817
<i>and he is really
on a roll now.</i>

58:47.901 --> 58:51.196
<i>Franklin, obviously
annoyed at what he thinks
is a bad call</i>

58:51.279 --> 58:53.948
<i>is muttering as he goes up
the first base line.</i>

58:54.032 --> 58:56.242
<i>Bill Murdie showing
some patience,</i>

58:56.326 --> 58:58.161
<i>but right back at him,
ready to bite.</i>

58:58.244 --> 58:59.662
<i>Here's that pitch again.</i>

58:59.746 --> 59:02.749
<i>It looked like it was in the
heart of the strike zone.</i>

59:02.832 --> 59:05.710
<i>It's a little surprising
that Franklin was so annoyed.</i>

59:05.793 --> 59:07.879
<i>And it looks like
for Bill Murdie,</i>

59:07.962 --> 59:10.590
<i>the pot is
about ready to boil over.</i>

59:11.049 --> 59:13.676
<i>So, a dominant inning
for Billy Chapel,</i>

59:13.760 --> 59:15.220
<i>striking out the side.</i>

59:22.435 --> 59:24.395
You're in the zone.

59:24.479 --> 59:25.855
<i>Number 24.</i>
Feels good.

59:25.939 --> 59:28.274
<i>Now, there's
Mickey Hart, 0 for 1.</i>

59:28.358 --> 59:30.235
<i>No score, fourth inning.</i>

59:30.318 --> 59:31.778
<i>Jack Spellman doing well.</i>

59:31.861 --> 59:34.030
<i>Has allowed only two hits
to the Tigers</i>

59:34.113 --> 59:37.367
<i>and meanwhile, Billy
Chapel in perfect control.</i>

59:38.952 --> 59:41.579
Oh, Mickey'll be gone
next year, too.

59:42.622 --> 59:45.458
Poor guy.
Never could get a break.

59:49.212 --> 59:50.797
Where was that catch
he missed?

59:51.297 --> 59:52.715
The one that hit him?

59:53.508 --> 59:56.052
They still play that on
Diamond Vision all the time.

59:56.135 --> 59:59.472
"There goes another
rubber tree plant."

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:05.937
Fenway.

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:31.796
Everything's all right, man.

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:41.014
Guess that looked pretty funny
out there today, huh?

01:00:43.391 --> 01:00:45.685
Probably end up
on ESPN or something.

01:00:45.768 --> 01:00:49.230
Lot of shit ends up
on ESPN I don't think
is very funny, Mick.

01:00:49.314 --> 01:00:51.232
Phone call, Mr. Chapel.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:53.943
There's a bunch of cameras
out there,

01:00:54.027 --> 01:00:55.695
waiting to make
a joke of this, Mick.

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:57.822
So you can either stop,

01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:00.742
give them the sound bite,
do the dance,

01:01:01.409 --> 01:01:03.077
or you hold your head up
and walk by,

01:01:03.161 --> 01:01:04.704
and the next time
we're in Boston

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:09.584
we'll go out there and we'll
work the wall together.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:12.378
Don't help them make
a joke out of you.

01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:20.303
Old school, baby. He's right.

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:22.889
- Chapel.
<i>- It's Jane.</i>

01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:25.141
<i>I got your number
from the front office.</i>

01:01:25.224 --> 01:01:27.977
<i>I hope that it's okay.</i>
No, that's all right.

01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:30.646
Don't worry about it.
What's wrong?

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.398
<i>Something's happened.</i>

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:34.901
<i>It's my daughter.
She ran away. And...</i>

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:37.487
Your daughter?
<i>I'll tell you.
I don't have time now.</i>

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.323
<i>But she's there in Boston.
Her father lives there.</i>

01:01:40.406 --> 01:01:42.241
<i>Oh, God.
We had a fight and she...</i>
All right.

01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:45.828
Jane, just slow down,
all right? Just slow down.

01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:48.998
<i>She climbed down the fire escape
and went to Penn Station</i>

01:01:49.082 --> 01:01:51.918
<i>got on a train to go to her
father, but he's not there.</i>

01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.669
What's the address?

01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:55.630
<i>8245 Clackton.</i>

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.507
<i>What's her name?</i>

01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:58.674
<i>Freedom.</i>

01:01:58.758 --> 01:01:59.884
<i>Freedom?</i>

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:03.262
<i>Scared you, didn't I?
Heather. It's Heather.</i>

01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:14.774
Heather?

01:02:20.113 --> 01:02:21.656
It's okay.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:25.118
I'm the guy your mom said
was coming to get you.

01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:33.042
Let's get out of here
before we get our asses
kicked twice in one night.

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.672
Heather?

01:02:41.217 --> 01:02:43.511
You're Heather.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:45.847
And you're
the baseball player.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.479
My mom can do nothing normal.

01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:11.456
Shut up.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.383
Do you want something?

01:03:22.467 --> 01:03:24.093
I'll have a V8.

01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:28.806
What is it with single men
and V8 juice?

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:32.310
I mean, my dad's fridge has
nothing but mustard in it,

01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:35.354
but when I come to visit,
it has mustard, fish sticks,

01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:38.357
and this big jug of V8 Juice.

01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:40.651
Like, if he makes me
choke down a glass,

01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:43.196
he's being healthy
and fatherly.

01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:47.575
Well, I like V8.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:50.578
It's nutritious.

01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.422
So, are you
my mom's boyfriend?

01:04:01.506 --> 01:04:03.090
I'm not sure.

01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:07.637
But you've slept with her.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:20.691
V8. It's a refreshing blend
of eight vegetable juices.

01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:35.581
What did you and
your mother fight about?

01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:46.259
I didn't come home from school
when I was supposed to

01:04:46.342 --> 01:04:48.719
because I was
with Mark Elton and...

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:53.224
She freaked out
because he has facial hair

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.434
and his parents
are never home.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:58.271
And I said,
"We didn't do anything."

01:04:58.354 --> 01:04:59.605
And she said,
"You could have."

01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:03.985
And I said,
"Well, I might love him."

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:06.279
And she said,
"You don't know what love is."

01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:08.573
And I said, "Well, I'm gonna
do what I want to do."

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:11.367
And she said,
"Well, not in this house."

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.451
And...

01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:16.163
So I went to my dad's because

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:19.542
he doesn't care what I do

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.920
'cause he's stoned
90 percent of the time.

01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:30.261
She just...

01:05:32.263 --> 01:05:35.558
She doesn't want me

01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:38.769
to make the same
mistakes that she did.

01:05:39.687 --> 01:05:42.189
I mean, she had me
when she was 16.

01:05:44.859 --> 01:05:48.487
I know she never had
a love story.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.994
And now, it's like
she doesn't believe in it.

01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:14.263
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

01:06:14.347 --> 01:06:15.848
I'm so sorry.

01:06:21.187 --> 01:06:22.521
Thank you.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.024
Billy?

01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:27.818
Come up.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:35.618
Don't ever do
that again, okay?
Okay.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:39.163
We can always work it out,
all right? Just talk to me.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.463
Honey, you want
some spaghetti?

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:50.216
No, it's okay. I'm tired.
You sure?

01:06:50.299 --> 01:06:52.677
Yeah. I ate on the plane.
Okay.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.846
How was it?
It was good.
It was really small.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.734
She's already asleep.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.238
Thank you.

01:07:58.033 --> 01:08:00.327
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:01.954
I don't know.

01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:05.499
I protect her, maybe too much.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:07.960
Some guys meet her

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:09.712
and they don't come
around anymore.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.174
She thinks it's her fault.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.261
You want some tea,
or something? I could make...

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.389
You hungry?
No, I'm good.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:27.688
It's nice.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.819
Good home.

01:08:34.487 --> 01:08:35.696
Thanks.

01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:53.839
I like to hold it in my hand

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:58.301
'cause I know somewhere
you're doing the same thing.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.019
I'm glad you called me.

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.526
I'm really glad.

01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:07.121
What are you doing down there?

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:11.125
My foot's been kicking
something down here all night.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:12.543
What is...

01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:21.218
It's not mine.

01:10:21.302 --> 01:10:23.178
Oh, you mean
it doubles as a flashlight?

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:27.725
It's really a flashlight.
No wonder you have
so many batteries

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:30.102
in this room.
Shut up.

01:10:33.606 --> 01:10:35.649
I'm hungry.
I'm starving.

01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:38.527
To the kitchen.

01:10:38.611 --> 01:10:41.697
About 20 hours of labor.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.198
Nicky was so freaked out,

01:10:43.282 --> 01:10:46.118
he didn't even stick
around for my sixth month.

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.537
But there was
this unbelievable nurse

01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.539
who stayed double shift
to be with me

01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:52.708
and feed me ice chips

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:58.464
and tell me when to breathe
and push and scream and...

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:03.677
Then, finally she came out.

01:11:03.761 --> 01:11:05.512
And they laid her
on my stomach,

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.306
and I could feel
her little heartbeat

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:09.850
and I just kept thinking,
over and over,

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:13.938
"You and me.
You and me, little girl."

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:19.109
And then I rigged out
my backpack

01:11:19.193 --> 01:11:21.111
like those baby slings
they have now

01:11:21.195 --> 01:11:25.240
and we walked out of there
two kids together.

01:11:31.622 --> 01:11:33.499
What are you thinking?

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:40.005
That you're heroic,
and I admire you.

01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:45.094
And you care a lot about me,

01:11:45.177 --> 01:11:47.888
but you can't afford
to get involved.

01:11:48.681 --> 01:11:50.474
Is that what's next?

01:11:55.688 --> 01:11:56.730
No.

01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:01.318
I was thinking
about you and Heather.

01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:09.952
And me.

01:12:14.206 --> 01:12:17.292
I was really thinking about

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:20.879
how nice it would be
to spend time together.

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:02.254
Oh, these are great.

01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.132
We'll use them
in Central Park.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:07.593
No, we can use them out here.

01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:15.559
You ever gotten
your heart broken?

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:16.977
Yeah.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:20.606
When we lost
the pennant in '87.

01:13:25.736 --> 01:13:28.947
Would you still love me
if I got burned in a fire?

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:31.658
Yes.

01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:35.496
<i>If I ran into a tree
and got paralyzed?</i>

01:13:40.793 --> 01:13:41.835
Yes.

01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:46.673
What if I were
totally disfigured?

01:13:46.757 --> 01:13:49.218
If my face were
all scraped away,

01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:52.137
I had no arms, no legs,
no brain waves

01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:54.640
and I was being kept alive
on a heart-lung machine,

01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:55.724
would you love me?

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:57.309
No.

01:13:58.811 --> 01:14:01.438
But we could still
be friends, though.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.154
Do you believe in God?

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:13.867
Yes.

01:14:16.245 --> 01:14:19.498
How old do you think
you're gonna be when you die?

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.380
Do you like
white meat or dark?

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:30.300
Dark.

01:14:30.384 --> 01:14:31.677
Dark?

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:34.429
You know,
the dark part's more fatty.

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:36.723
But it's cool.
It's cool to like that part.

01:14:36.807 --> 01:14:40.102
You like it chopped up and...

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:43.272
You know how people dice it
in that salad, the chef salad?

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:47.401
Or you like it torn? 'Cause
I personally like it torn.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:50.404
Not that you have
to like it how I like it.

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:03.876
No questions.

01:15:16.889 --> 01:15:19.474
<i>Why do you
ask me all this stuff?</i>

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.894
<i>Because I want
to know you.</i>

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.609
<i>Breaking ball. A comebacker,
right at Billy Chapel</i>

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.986
<i>to hold on to the line drive.</i>

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:33.113
<i>This is one of those
chuck-and-duck pitches.</i>

01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:35.574
<i>When you throw like that, it
comes back at you that quick</i>

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:37.576
<i>it's almost like
the ball catches you.</i>

01:15:37.659 --> 01:15:40.537
<i>And so far, Chapel
is getting away with it.</i>

01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:42.748
Go Tigers! Go Tigers!

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.655
<i>So, we have one
out here in the top
of the sixth inning. No score.</i>

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:17.866
Spellman has allowed two hits.
Chapel has been perfect.

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:20.869
And the batter is
Gus Sinski, 0 for 1.

01:16:20.953 --> 01:16:23.205
<i>Gus has had a tough
year this year at the plate,</i>

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:26.041
<i>but they really pay him for
what he does behind the plate.</i>

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:28.043
<i>He handles his pitching staff
so well</i>

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.544
<i>and any kind of hit
that he gets</i>

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:31.672
<i>is a bonus for this club.</i>

01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:40.305
<i>Jaime Ruiz is a little
slow in coming up with it.</i>

01:16:40.389 --> 01:16:42.182
Get down! Get down!

01:16:42.849 --> 01:16:44.476
Safe!
Damn it! It was close!

01:16:44.559 --> 01:16:46.228
He beat the play!

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:48.981
Good call.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.159
Well, in a game like this,
that could be a huge play.

01:17:01.243 --> 01:17:03.537
The last leg double Sinski had

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.580
was during
the Reagan administration.

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:08.458
<i>And the Yankees are now on the
phone talking to the bullpen.</i>

01:17:09.084 --> 01:17:11.586
<i>And they get a left-hander up.</i>

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:14.006
<i>Bobby Mack is ticked off
with the Yankees</i>

01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:18.760
<i>and he gives batter JosÃ©
Garcia the intentional walk.</i>

01:17:18.844 --> 01:17:21.471
<i>So, in a moment, there will be
runners at first and second,</i>

01:17:21.555 --> 01:17:22.639
<i>one out in the sixth,</i>

01:17:22.723 --> 01:17:25.600
<i>no score, and a left-hand
hitter coming up.</i>

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:27.686
<i>That would be Brian Whitt.</i>

01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:06.016
Jane!

01:18:07.225 --> 01:18:10.687
I was just looking
for you. Billy?

01:18:13.065 --> 01:18:14.441
Oh, my God.

01:18:18.028 --> 01:18:20.447
I can't feel anything.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.116
Hold this. Close your
fingers around it.

01:18:23.784 --> 01:18:24.785
Hold it up. Hold it up.

01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:35.712
Hold on, Billy.

01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:43.553
Occupation?

01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:46.681
Pitcher. He's hurt his hand.
We need a doctor.

01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:48.433
Are you his wife?
No.

01:18:48.517 --> 01:18:49.726
Are you a relative?
No.

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:52.646
Then I'll have to ask you
to wait outside.

01:18:53.438 --> 01:18:54.564
Jane!

01:18:55.482 --> 01:18:58.402
My friend cut his hand.
It's bleeding very deeply.

01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:01.363
Is there one of you
that can please help?
Ma'am!

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:06.493
Is this not America?

01:19:06.576 --> 01:19:11.373
Is baseball not
America's favorite pastime?

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.835
Can I help you?
Are you a doctor?

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:17.712
Yes.
Thank you, God.

01:19:22.968 --> 01:19:25.512
- Jane.
- I'm right here.

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:28.348
Jane, call Mike Udall.
What?

01:19:28.432 --> 01:19:30.600
The trainer in Detroit.
Call him.

01:19:30.684 --> 01:19:31.977
Tell him what happened.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.395
I'm going with you.

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.856
Sorry. There's not enough room
in the medevac.

01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:38.275
You're gonna need
to stay here.

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.116
Jane!

01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:50.495
Call Mike!

01:19:50.579 --> 01:19:53.081
He's the most important person
for me right now.

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:00.672
You need to clear out.

01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:33.079
<i>There's a little flare
just by Howell's glove
into right field.</i>

01:20:33.163 --> 01:20:36.124
<i>Here comes Sinski. Colborn
waved him to the plate.</i>

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:39.794
<i>The throw. He is in there!</i>
Safe! Safe!

01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:42.380
<i>And the Tigers
take a 1-0 lead.</i>

01:20:42.464 --> 01:20:44.382
<i>But what a great slide
by Sinski,</i>

01:20:44.466 --> 01:20:46.635
<i>sliding away
from the play at the plate.</i>

01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:49.387
<i>Jim Colborn, the third base
coach, didn't even hesitate.</i>

01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:52.140
<i>He had their catcher,
the slowest guy on their team,
coming around third,</i>

01:20:52.224 --> 01:20:54.100
<i>trying to score
in a scoreless ball game</i>

01:20:54.184 --> 01:20:57.354
<i>had no hesitation at all.
Sent him all the way.</i>

01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:03.109
<i>It's all bullshit,
Billy. Don't listen to it.</i>

01:21:03.193 --> 01:21:04.361
<i>You've done it all.</i>

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:06.530
<i>You've won every award
there is to win.</i>

01:21:06.947 --> 01:21:09.533
<i>You've got a room reserved
at Cooperstown, Billy.</i>

01:21:09.616 --> 01:21:12.827
<i>I just don't know how much
more you have to prove.</i>

01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:14.079
<i>And even if you do come back,</i>

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:16.498
<i>you're not gonna be
100 percent.</i>

01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:18.500
<i>Billy, you may not even be 50.</i>

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.669
<i>- What'd you say?
- Nothing.</i>

01:21:20.752 --> 01:21:22.462
Let's knock off for today.
Jane's here.

01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:23.630
What did you say?

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:24.798
I didn't say anything.

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:26.174
You said "if."

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:28.176
I didn't mean "if."
But you said "if."

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.387
Come on, I only meant that...
You think I'm not coming back?

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:31.680
Billy.

01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:33.765
Say it.

01:21:33.848 --> 01:21:35.016
You're tired.
Let's quit for...

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.893
Say it, chickenshit.

01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:40.438
You got a job.

01:21:40.564 --> 01:21:43.942
That's to get me strong,
and get me back. All right?

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:46.987
You get me back.

01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:49.197
I'll figure out how to win.

01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:54.077
You want to work
with me tomorrow,

01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:55.620
you get your mind right.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:59.374
You get it right,
or you don't come around me.

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:02.043
<i>You mad at me or Mike?
Why would I be
mad at Mike?</i>

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:04.546
<i>You practically
tore his head off.</i>

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:07.173
Talk to me.
Talk? You don't want to talk.

01:22:07.257 --> 01:22:10.969
You just want to give me your
version of why I should quit.

01:22:12.679 --> 01:22:14.764
I want this shit out of here.

01:22:14.848 --> 01:22:16.975
What are you trying to do?

01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.479
Are you trying to make me mad?

01:22:21.563 --> 01:22:23.356
You're gonna pack up my things
and make me go

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.734
so you can sit here in the dark
and feel sorry for yourself.

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:27.027
Well, forget it, Billy.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.696
You can't cook.
You can't drive.

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:39.205
I'll hire somebody
to drive me.

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:44.669
Someone who doesn't talk?
Doesn't think bad thoughts?

01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:48.131
Billy, we are gonna
get through this.

01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:49.424
You just have to try.

01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:51.176
We've got to be...
Try! Try! God damn it, Jane.

01:22:51.259 --> 01:22:52.927
I'm the only one
who's trying here.

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:57.265
Now I got nobody in the front
office, nobody in the press,

01:22:57.349 --> 01:23:01.811
and now I got nobody
in this house that thinks
I'm gonna make it back.

01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:05.357
I have been nothing
but supportive of you.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.234
I don't even want you here,
Jane! I mean...

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:11.029
Don't you get it?

01:23:13.782 --> 01:23:17.160
You make me feel distracted.

01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:21.456
You make me feel weak.

01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:46.481
Billy, you taught me
something.

01:23:47.065 --> 01:23:49.275
You taught me
how to believe again.

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:53.238
How good things can happen,
and that they will happen.

01:23:53.321 --> 01:23:54.989
But now you need
to let me teach you

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:56.908
something about what I know.

01:23:56.991 --> 01:24:00.912
About how sometimes life seems
like it's slamming you down,

01:24:00.995 --> 01:24:03.415
but it's really
giving you a gift.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:07.127
I had a baby when I was 16.

01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:11.256
That could have wrecked me,
but it didn't.

01:24:11.339 --> 01:24:15.051
Instead it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:19.973
You mean if life
gives you lemons,

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:21.599
you make lemonade?

01:24:23.852 --> 01:24:25.520
You are such an asshole.

01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:30.233
Yeah. Well, if you're telling
me I'm not ever gonna
hold that ball again...

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:34.779
I can't.

01:24:36.656 --> 01:24:39.909
I mean, haven't you ever loved
anything that much?

01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:46.791
I'll call the airlines.

01:24:47.459 --> 01:24:50.295
See what kind
of flights I can make.

01:24:54.424 --> 01:24:55.842
You do that.

01:25:07.687 --> 01:25:08.730
Strike!

01:25:08.813 --> 01:25:11.316
<i>Uh-oh.
Something happen to Chapel?</i>

01:25:13.276 --> 01:25:15.570
<i>Frank Perry is on
the steps of the dugout</i>

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:18.448
<i>and apparently
he didn't like what he saw.</i>

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:20.158
Give me the ball.

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:24.204
What are you looking...
Give me the ball!

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.956
Stay there.

01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:32.670
<i>There's something wrong
with either his arm,</i>

01:25:32.754 --> 01:25:34.631
<i>his elbow
or his shoulder there.</i>

01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:37.175
<i>He doesn't look
very comfortable.</i>

01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:39.302
Bill, he's hurt.

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:42.013
<i>Now here he comes.
He's going out to visit.</i>

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:46.392
You just do
something there?

01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:47.477
No.

01:25:48.102 --> 01:25:49.729
You hurting?
No.

01:25:51.523 --> 01:25:52.816
How long?

01:25:54.609 --> 01:25:55.944
Ten years.

01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.447
What do you want to do?

01:25:59.531 --> 01:26:00.824
I'd like you to smile at me,

01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:01.950
pat me on the fanny

01:26:02.033 --> 01:26:04.244
and march your butt
to that dugout and sit down.

01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:06.454
That's what I'd like.
I want this goddamn
game, Billy.

01:26:06.538 --> 01:26:08.373
Well, I want it, too.

01:26:18.466 --> 01:26:21.010
If it gets any worse,
I'll sit down.

01:26:23.888 --> 01:26:25.306
Ready to go?

01:26:30.645 --> 01:26:32.230
Where's my pat?

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:38.611
Thank you.

01:26:38.695 --> 01:26:41.072
You let me know.
Yeah. He's all right.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:44.409
He's flexing his hand.

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:45.660
What?

01:26:45.743 --> 01:26:48.121
He does that
when his arm's tingling.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.498
Pretty soon he's not gonna be
able to feel anything and...

01:26:50.582 --> 01:26:52.083
You know him?

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:54.878
Yeah, and I know
Mickey fucking Mantle.

01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:58.423
Hey, watch the language, okay?
There's people in here.

01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:04.429
God, I hate Yankee fans.

01:27:04.512 --> 01:27:07.098
Hey, you leaving?
How can you leave
when your guy's winning?

01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:08.266
He's not gonna win.

01:27:08.349 --> 01:27:09.726
How do you know?

01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:12.312
Because he's hurting
and he won't tell anyone,

01:27:12.395 --> 01:27:14.856
and he won't come out.

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:17.066
I don't know.

01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:18.860
Honey, I hope you're wrong.

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:20.778
<i>As you
mentioned earlier,</i>

01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:24.198
<i>there's no love lost at all
between Tuttle and Chapel</i>

01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:28.286
<i>and Tuttle would just love
to break up this perfecto
right now.</i>

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:29.871
<i>Yes, he would.</i>

01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:38.296
<i>And he bunts up
along third! Down to get it.</i>

01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:42.258
<i>Backhanded by Chapel,
throws to first.</i>

01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:44.802
What are you bunting for,
Tuttle?

01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:46.846
We need a hit,
you pansy!

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:49.182
<i>And for the third time today,</i>

01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:52.226
<i>Sam Tuttle has boiled over,
arguing now</i>

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:55.355
<i>with first base umpire
Richie Garcia.</i>

01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:57.815
<i>Take another look at it.</i>

01:27:57.899 --> 01:27:59.776
<i>The only guy that can
field this ball is Chapel.</i>

01:27:59.859 --> 01:28:01.903
<i>He's like a cat off the mound,
going to the side.</i>

01:28:01.986 --> 01:28:04.072
<i>He slides and picks up
the ball and throws it.</i>

01:28:04.155 --> 01:28:07.825
<i>That enabled him
to get up quicker
than to just bend over.</i>

01:28:33.393 --> 01:28:37.021
<i>What a mix
we have going on
for the last two innings.</i>

01:28:37.105 --> 01:28:40.316
<i>And sitting alone upstairs,
owner Gary Wheeler</i>

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.278
<i>reportedly has already sold
his ball club, the Tigers,</i>

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:47.240
<i>to the corporate group
in the box to his left.</i>

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:51.077
<i>And now an unconfirmed report
beginning to ripple the water</i>

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.289
<i>that the corporate's
first business would be
to trade Billy Chapel</i>

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:56.791
<i>when the season is over.</i>

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:58.960
<i>So, as so often happens
in a ball game,</i>

01:28:59.043 --> 01:29:00.962
<i>there are
so many other undercurrents</i>

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:03.506
<i>so many more things
than meet the eye,</i>

01:29:03.589 --> 01:29:05.174
<i>and here we have it all.</i>

01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:07.969
<i>A beleaguered owner
selling a ball club,</i>

01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:11.806
<i>perhaps the new owner selling
the biggest star on the club</i>

01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:15.101
<i>and all the while,
Billy Chapel perhaps</i>

01:29:15.184 --> 01:29:17.687
<i>trying to make
the decision of his life.</i>

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.647
<i>Does he remain
a big leaguer?</i>

01:29:19.731 --> 01:29:23.026
<i>Or, after 19 years,
will he call it quits?</i>

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:30.408
See that?
Man, it just takes off.

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:31.492
I just don't even
know where...

01:29:31.576 --> 01:29:33.578
Use the seams.
Well, I am using the seams,

01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:36.748
but I can't feel the seams.
Just...

01:30:49.821 --> 01:30:54.075
Tell her about the exhibition
you went to with
the she-male paintings.

01:30:54.158 --> 01:30:57.161
You know, the portraits...
Tell her that one.

01:30:58.663 --> 01:31:00.164
You tell them.
It's your story.

01:31:00.248 --> 01:31:02.458
Please. Will you excuse me?

01:31:02.542 --> 01:31:03.835
Sure.
Thanks.

01:31:03.918 --> 01:31:05.920
But I don't have enough
black on, or what?

01:31:06.003 --> 01:31:07.630
No. It's just that
you're not on the list.

01:31:07.713 --> 01:31:08.756
Oh!

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.925
So, you need
an invitation to get in.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:13.219
Here comes my invitation.

01:31:14.804 --> 01:31:16.347
It's all right.

01:31:20.184 --> 01:31:23.855
I tried to tell him
that baseball's America's
favorite pastime,

01:31:23.938 --> 01:31:25.606
but he wasn't...

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.111
I called your office.
They told me where you were.

01:31:30.194 --> 01:31:32.321
I hope you don't mind.

01:31:34.365 --> 01:31:35.992
How's your hand?

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:40.538
Better?

01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:44.709
You look beautiful.

01:31:47.712 --> 01:31:50.047
Jane.
Excuse me just one moment.

01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:52.008
Jane, what's the ma...

01:31:52.842 --> 01:31:54.552
Billy Chapel?

01:31:56.554 --> 01:31:57.597
Yeah.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.599
So nice to finally
meet you. I'm Ian.

01:32:01.392 --> 01:32:02.935
Ian? The editor?

01:32:03.019 --> 01:32:04.896
Yes, I guess so.

01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:06.772
Jane's told me
so much about you.

01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:08.900
So, you're
in town with the team?

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:11.485
Yeah.

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:14.572
I saw you play against
the Padres in the World Series
back in the '80s

01:32:14.655 --> 01:32:17.658
when I worked in LA.
It was fantastic.

01:32:17.742 --> 01:32:19.202
You like baseball?

01:32:19.285 --> 01:32:21.120
Yeah, sure.

01:32:22.038 --> 01:32:23.206
May I?

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:27.585
So, do you like the paintings?

01:32:33.007 --> 01:32:34.342
No?

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:36.886
Would you excuse us?
We're gonna have a drink.

01:32:36.969 --> 01:32:38.554
Sure. Go ahead.

01:32:46.896 --> 01:32:48.731
You don't smoke.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:50.441
I do sometimes.

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:55.446
Billy, you surprised me here.
I didn't know...

01:32:58.115 --> 01:32:59.367
I have to go.

01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:00.868
Let me walk you.
Let me give you a ride.

01:33:00.952 --> 01:33:02.536
I can't.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.080
Why not?

01:33:04.163 --> 01:33:05.957
Because I came with someone.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.166
What?

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:08.876
I came with Ian.

01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:12.046
Thank you so much for coming.

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:15.925
You mean like a date?

01:33:21.681 --> 01:33:23.891
Are you seeing him?

01:33:24.225 --> 01:33:25.810
Yes.

01:33:28.479 --> 01:33:31.399
I haven't seen you in five
months. You haven't called.

01:33:31.482 --> 01:33:34.610
I called.
Three times in five months.

01:33:34.694 --> 01:33:36.279
You knew what I was doing.

01:33:36.362 --> 01:33:37.571
What about
what I've been doing?

01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:40.700
You have no idea
what I've been doing
for the last five months.

01:33:40.783 --> 01:33:43.286
When you come in here,
you insult my friends,

01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:45.246
you embarrass me...
I didn't insult anybody.

01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:48.708
The prick asked me if I liked
the painting. I said I didn't.

01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.961
And I didn't come in here
to embarrass you.

01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:55.006
I mean, you could have
told me.

01:33:55.089 --> 01:33:56.674
I mean, you could have
said something to me.

01:33:56.799 --> 01:33:58.968
Said what?
God damn it, Jane,
you never just

01:33:59.051 --> 01:34:00.177
lay it out there.

01:34:00.261 --> 01:34:01.846
Lay what out there?

01:34:02.722 --> 01:34:05.516
That you hurt me?
Is that what you want?

01:34:06.559 --> 01:34:09.770
How they...on the plane
ride home

01:34:09.854 --> 01:34:12.773
the flight attendant had
to ask me how I was?

01:34:12.857 --> 01:34:15.067
How in the cab,

01:34:15.151 --> 01:34:18.404
I couldn't tell the cab
driver where I lived?

01:34:18.487 --> 01:34:22.033
Or how I had to beg Heather
to sleep with me?

01:34:22.116 --> 01:34:23.409
Is that what you want?

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:25.828
Is that what you want me
to tell you?
I'll tell you all about it.

01:34:25.911 --> 01:34:26.912
I'm sorry.

01:34:26.996 --> 01:34:30.583
I'm sorry about
what I said to you
that day in the condo.

01:34:31.292 --> 01:34:36.130
It's all right.
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:40.009
I think maybe that
you and I are just

01:34:40.885 --> 01:34:43.346
not the same kind of people.

01:34:49.894 --> 01:34:52.313
Look, I'm pitching tomorrow
night in Yankee Stadium.

01:34:52.396 --> 01:34:53.856
I want you to come.
No.

01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:55.107
You and Heather.
No.

01:34:55.191 --> 01:34:59.111
Please. It's my first game
back. I want you to be there.

01:34:59.195 --> 01:35:01.530
I'll be watching you.

01:35:01.614 --> 01:35:04.241
You know I'll always
be watching you.

01:35:04.617 --> 01:35:06.911
Just not from
the friends' box.

01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:29.952
<i>The Tigers
with a 1-0 lead,</i>

01:36:30.035 --> 01:36:32.580
<i>but the story would be
the inability of the Yankees</i>

01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:34.498
<i>to do anything with Chapel.</i>

01:36:34.582 --> 01:36:36.417
<i>No runs, no hits, no errors,</i>

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:40.504
<i>but more importantly,
no base runners of any kind.</i>

01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:45.676
<i>Billy Chapel is looking
a possible perfect game
right in the eye.</i>

01:36:48.387 --> 01:36:51.682
<i>Billy Chapel all alone,
his teammates staying away.</i>

01:36:51.765 --> 01:36:54.101
<i>They don't want
to intrude upon the zone.</i>

01:36:54.435 --> 01:36:57.438
<i>So Wheeler rooting for a kid
that he signed when...</i>

01:36:57.521 --> 01:37:00.733
You guys, please.
<i>...Billy Chapel was
in high school.</i>

01:37:00.816 --> 01:37:03.527
<i>And Wheeler now seeing
the fruition of the hope</i>

01:37:03.611 --> 01:37:08.908
<i>and the long work in the
19 years, with six outs away.</i>

01:37:52.868 --> 01:37:54.662
How you doing, ace?

01:37:56.705 --> 01:37:58.499
Anybody been on base?

01:38:00.668 --> 01:38:01.877
Nobody.

01:38:03.837 --> 01:38:05.089
Nobody?

01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:09.051
This I ain't seen much of.

01:38:11.136 --> 01:38:12.513
Me neither.

01:38:13.806 --> 01:38:15.057
Chappie!

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:17.476
I never have.

01:38:21.939 --> 01:38:23.607
What's the matter?

01:38:25.818 --> 01:38:28.445
I don't know
if I have anything left.

01:38:29.446 --> 01:38:30.447
Chappie!

01:38:32.324 --> 01:38:35.828
You just throw whatever
you've got. Whatever's left.

01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:37.454
The boys are all here for you.

01:38:37.955 --> 01:38:39.915
We'll back you up.
We'll be there.

01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:41.959
'Cause, Billy,

01:38:43.794 --> 01:38:46.547
we don't stink right now.

01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:51.218
We're the best team
in baseball right now, right
this minute, 'cause of you.

01:38:51.302 --> 01:38:53.721
You're the reason.

01:38:53.804 --> 01:38:55.055
We're not gonna screw that up.

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:57.057
We're gonna be awesome
for you right now.

01:38:57.933 --> 01:38:59.310
Just throw.

01:39:07.359 --> 01:39:09.820
All right? Come on. Come on.

01:39:29.882 --> 01:39:33.427
<i>Billy Chapel has
retired 21 consecutive batters</i>

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:34.970
<i>striking out eight.</i>

01:39:35.054 --> 01:39:36.972
<i>And as the Fates
would have it,</i>

01:39:37.056 --> 01:39:39.725
<i>one of his closest friends
and a former teammate,</i>

01:39:39.808 --> 01:39:43.520
<i>Davis Birch, will try to snatch
the diamond away from him.</i>

01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:46.690
<i>Leading off in the bottom
of the eighth inning.</i>

01:39:52.655 --> 01:39:55.240
<i>Ball one, and now
the question, of course</i>

01:39:55.324 --> 01:39:58.827
<i>how much petrol has
Billy Chapel got in the tank?</i>

01:39:58.911 --> 01:40:01.830
<i>Remember, it was just two
innings ago</i>

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:04.166
<i>that he started to hurt,
the arm tightened up.</i>

01:40:04.249 --> 01:40:06.210
<i>Somehow or other
he got through it,</i>

01:40:06.293 --> 01:40:08.420
<i>but now
he is in the eighth inning,</i>

01:40:08.504 --> 01:40:10.881
<i>facing a most
dangerous hitter.</i>

01:40:13.676 --> 01:40:14.927
<i>Ball two.</i>

01:40:26.063 --> 01:40:28.899
Jim, get Stafford up.

01:40:34.446 --> 01:40:35.531
Frank...

01:40:35.614 --> 01:40:37.616
I can see the scoreboard.

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.244
I know what's going on, okay?
Just in case.

01:41:03.225 --> 01:41:04.435
Retire!

01:41:08.105 --> 01:41:11.650
<i>Billy. Billy,
you can do it.</i>

01:41:11.734 --> 01:41:13.902
Just calm down.

01:41:13.986 --> 01:41:16.947
Throw the ball to the glove.
Just play catch.

01:41:27.458 --> 01:41:31.211
<i>So a moment of truth,
and he's had several,
for Billy Chapel.</i>

01:41:31.295 --> 01:41:32.588
<i>3 and 0.</i>

01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:04.578
Strike one!

01:42:04.661 --> 01:42:06.872
<i>You want to see
a big-time pitch?</i>

01:42:06.955 --> 01:42:10.000
<i>When you consider the noise,
the situation, this stadium,</i>

01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:12.002
<i>that's unbelievable.</i>

01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:23.388
<i>Well, they put
the handcuffs on him, 3 and 0,</i>

01:42:23.472 --> 01:42:24.932
<i>but he's such
an aggressive hitter</i>

01:42:25.015 --> 01:42:28.227
<i>you know they're gonna
green-light him 3 and 1.</i>

01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:33.232
There it goes!

01:42:38.487 --> 01:42:41.114
<i>There's a high drive
into deep right field!</i>

01:42:41.198 --> 01:42:44.535
<i>Back goes Mickey Hart
to the track at the wall</i>

01:42:44.618 --> 01:42:47.037
<i>and leaps up
and one-hands it!</i>

01:42:47.871 --> 01:42:49.832
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:00.717 --> 01:43:02.678
I love you, Mickey Hart!

01:43:05.722 --> 01:43:08.642
<i>He took a home run
away from Davis Birch</i>

01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:10.936
<i>and the perfecto is
still alive!</i>

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.146
<i>What a play
by Mickey Hart right here.</i>

01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:14.648
<i>This is a ball right out
over the middle</i>

01:43:14.731 --> 01:43:15.732
<i>and Birch just hammers it.</i>

01:43:23.365 --> 01:43:26.535
You got lucky again, Chapel!
That's a great play!

01:43:37.838 --> 01:43:40.299
I'll miss you the most,
Scarecrow.

01:43:40.382 --> 01:43:42.551
Ma'am? Are you coming?

01:43:46.138 --> 01:43:48.891
I'm sorry.
You'll have to board now.

01:43:52.895 --> 01:43:54.104
Ma'am?

01:43:55.314 --> 01:43:56.523
Ma'am?

01:43:59.109 --> 01:44:00.611
Ma'am?

01:44:00.694 --> 01:44:03.363
Give my seat to somebody else.

01:44:03.447 --> 01:44:07.492
<i>Twenty-two consecutive
outs retired by Billy Chapel</i>

01:44:07.576 --> 01:44:10.412
<i>and he goes head-to-head
with Lenny Howell.</i>

01:44:14.458 --> 01:44:16.376
<i>Fastball pulled
to the right side.</i>

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:19.463
<i>A sliding stop
by Marcus Ransom to get him.</i>

01:44:19.546 --> 01:44:21.506
<i>That's the second time today</i>

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:26.178
<i>that Ransom has taken
a base hit away
from Lenny Howell.</i>

01:44:26.261 --> 01:44:28.847
<i>And now four outs away.</i>

01:44:31.433 --> 01:44:35.437
<i>We haven't seen Billy
Chapel go this far into a game
for a lot of starts now.</i>

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.898
<i>He looks very, very tired.</i>

01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:41.026
<i>Now the batter
will be Ted Franklin,</i>

01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:43.028
<i>the local boy from New York.</i>

01:44:43.111 --> 01:44:46.114
<i>You know he wants to atone
for two strikeouts.</i>

01:44:49.201 --> 01:44:50.327
Gus!

01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:53.872
<i>High, twisting foul,
off to the right of the plate.</i>

01:44:53.956 --> 01:44:57.084
<i>Sinski coming back,
and makes the play.</i>

01:44:57.167 --> 01:45:02.339
<i>Chapel has done it
for eight, retiring
24 consecutive batters.</i>

01:45:02.422 --> 01:45:07.010
Billy Chapel is certainly
getting more than a little
help from his friends.

01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:24.319
Thanks.

01:45:26.113 --> 01:45:28.031
Billy Chapel, right?
Right.

01:45:28.115 --> 01:45:33.245
I took my kids to see you
play your rookie year
a long time ago.

01:45:33.328 --> 01:45:34.621
You were great.

01:45:34.705 --> 01:45:37.457
Thank you.
I'll be there
in one minute.

01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:40.210
Billy?

01:45:40.293 --> 01:45:41.795
Do you remember me?

01:45:41.878 --> 01:45:43.755
Heather! Sweetheart.

01:45:46.842 --> 01:45:48.760
How are you? I mean...

01:45:48.844 --> 01:45:50.345
What are you doing here?

01:45:50.429 --> 01:45:51.888
I'm going to U.S.C.

01:45:51.972 --> 01:45:53.473
Really?
Yeah.

01:45:54.391 --> 01:45:55.434
That's great.

01:45:55.517 --> 01:45:57.436
Are you playing
the Angels or...

01:45:57.519 --> 01:45:59.438
Yeah, here for the Angels.

01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:01.898
And how's your season going?

01:46:01.982 --> 01:46:03.316
Okay.

01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:09.448
Well, not so good, really,
but it's almost over now.

01:46:11.825 --> 01:46:13.410
How's your mom?

01:46:13.493 --> 01:46:15.662
Heather, hurry up.

01:46:15.746 --> 01:46:17.956
She's good. She's really good.

01:46:18.498 --> 01:46:19.750
Heather!

01:46:23.045 --> 01:46:24.087
Go.

01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:28.508
I miss you.

01:46:30.552 --> 01:46:32.137
I miss you, too.

01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:42.606
You don't have plans, do you?

01:46:42.689 --> 01:46:44.483
<i>No, I don't.</i>

01:46:44.566 --> 01:46:47.611
Well, I'm gonna be there,
and it's been awhile.

01:46:48.487 --> 01:46:50.113
<i>A long time.</i>

01:46:50.197 --> 01:46:53.533
I just thought dinner
at the Waldorf might be nice.

01:46:53.617 --> 01:46:54.993
About 6:00?

01:46:55.077 --> 01:46:57.579
How about 8:00, your room?

01:46:57.662 --> 01:46:59.081
<i>Even better.</i>

01:46:59.164 --> 01:47:01.166
Great. I'll see you then.

01:47:48.588 --> 01:47:49.923
I knew it.

01:47:50.841 --> 01:47:52.843
The day I met you
five years ago.
What?

01:47:54.302 --> 01:47:56.429
You don't need me.

01:47:56.513 --> 01:48:00.600
You and the ball and
the diamond, you're perfect.

01:48:00.684 --> 01:48:02.811
You're a perfectly
beautiful thing.

01:48:02.894 --> 01:48:05.897
You can win or lose the game
all by yourself.

01:49:21.097 --> 01:49:22.098
Mike.

01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.602
You all right, Billy?

01:49:26.478 --> 01:49:27.520
Yeah. You got a pen?

01:49:27.604 --> 01:49:28.605
Oh, yeah.

01:49:32.817 --> 01:49:34.861
Want you to do me a favor.

01:49:35.695 --> 01:49:40.367
I want you to give this
to Wheeler's nephew.

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:42.118
His nephew?

01:49:42.994 --> 01:49:45.205
Yeah, that kid
in the clubhouse.

01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:46.289
Oh.

01:50:07.602 --> 01:50:09.396
Three more! Come on!

01:50:09.646 --> 01:50:11.648
Nothing drops out there!

01:50:17.612 --> 01:50:19.447
Jesus Christ.

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.534
<i>Billy Chapel is
40 years old</i>

01:50:22.617 --> 01:50:25.537
<i>as he sits in the dugout
here at Yankee Stadium.</i>

01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:28.790
<i>40 years old,
arm weary and aching.</i>

01:50:28.873 --> 01:50:34.296
<i>And don't let anybody
tell you or Billy
that life begins at 40.</i>

01:50:34.379 --> 01:50:38.800
<i>4, 100 innings Billy Chapel
has walked to the mound</i>

01:50:38.883 --> 01:50:41.428
<i>in a brilliant 19-year career.</i>

01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:44.180
<i>But never before
in all those years</i>

01:50:44.264 --> 01:50:48.518
<i>and in all those innings
has he ever had
a date with destiny</i>

01:50:48.601 --> 01:50:50.353
<i>as he has right now.</i>

01:50:51.479 --> 01:50:55.400
<i>He will make the fateful walk
to the loneliest spot
in the world,</i>

01:50:55.483 --> 01:50:57.652
<i>the pitching mound
at Yankee Stadium,</i>

01:50:57.736 --> 01:51:01.573
<i>in quest of the pitcher's
dream, the perfect game.</i>

01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:24.929
<i>Billy Chapel,
in quest of the perfect game.</i>

01:51:25.013 --> 01:51:29.684
<i>You also realize he may
very well be at the crossroads
of a brilliant career.</i>

01:51:29.768 --> 01:51:32.312
<i>He's a cinch to wind up
in the Hall of Fame.</i>

01:51:32.395 --> 01:51:36.191
<i>However, after this game he
has to make the big decision.</i>

01:51:36.274 --> 01:51:39.527
<i>A, will he continue
to do what has been his life,</i>

01:51:39.611 --> 01:51:42.072
<i>maybe more important
than life itself, baseball?</i>

01:51:42.155 --> 01:51:44.866
<i>Or will he hang it up,
and would a perfect game</i>

01:51:44.949 --> 01:51:48.286
<i>give him
the logical conclusion
to the great career?</i>

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:13.770
Strout.

01:52:14.687 --> 01:52:17.315
You're hitting for Ruiz.
Grab a bat.

01:52:26.825 --> 01:52:29.786
<i>At 40 years old,
Billy Chapel is flirting</i>

01:52:29.869 --> 01:52:33.039
<i>with perhaps the greatest
accomplishment in baseball.</i>

01:52:33.123 --> 01:52:36.376
<i>And standing in his way
will be Matt Crane</i>

01:52:36.459 --> 01:52:39.796
<i>hitting for Babe Nardini,
then Jesus Cabrillo.</i>

01:52:39.879 --> 01:52:43.258
<i>And Ken Strout has a bat
in his hands in the dugout</i>

01:52:43.341 --> 01:52:46.845
<i>and might very well get the
call to bat for Jaime Ruiz.</i>

01:52:49.514 --> 01:52:52.559
<i>And you know, Steve,
you get the feeling
that Billy Chapel</i>

01:52:52.642 --> 01:52:54.561
<i>isn't pitching
against left-handers,</i>

01:52:54.644 --> 01:52:56.729
<i>isn't pitching
against pinch-hitters,</i>

01:52:56.813 --> 01:52:59.023
<i>he isn't pitching
against the Yankees.</i>

01:52:59.107 --> 01:53:00.900
<i>He's pitching against time.</i>

01:53:00.984 --> 01:53:04.279
<i>He's pitching against
the future, against age,</i>

01:53:04.362 --> 01:53:07.365
<i>and even, when you think about
his career, against ending.</i>

01:53:07.449 --> 01:53:09.576
<i>And tonight,
I think he might be able</i>

01:53:09.659 --> 01:53:12.829
<i>to use that aching
old arm one more time</i>

01:53:12.912 --> 01:53:15.623
<i>to push the sun
back up in the sky</i>

01:53:15.707 --> 01:53:18.501
<i>and give us
one more day of summer.</i>

01:53:26.718 --> 01:53:27.927
Lord,

01:53:29.345 --> 01:53:33.183
I know I always said
I'd never involve you
in a baseball game.

01:53:33.892 --> 01:53:35.810
It always seemed silly.

01:53:36.728 --> 01:53:38.980
I mean, you got enough to do.

01:53:40.982 --> 01:53:45.236
But if there's any way
you could make this pain
in my shoulder go away

01:53:45.445 --> 01:53:47.322
for about 10 minutes.

01:53:58.208 --> 01:53:59.959
Clear the mechanism.

01:54:17.977 --> 01:54:19.729
Clear the mechanism.

01:54:38.623 --> 01:54:41.209
Okay. Okay.

01:54:43.002 --> 01:54:44.379
Three more.

01:54:46.089 --> 01:54:48.216
Like I done a million times.

01:55:03.856 --> 01:55:06.859
<i>It's so tough to come
off the bench, and sit and
watch eight innings of play</i>

01:55:06.943 --> 01:55:09.737
<i>and then go up there cold,
and have to try
to swing the bat.</i>

01:55:09.821 --> 01:55:12.365
<i>But if you don't get your
pitch and hack at it early</i>

01:55:12.448 --> 01:55:14.200
<i>you might not see another one.</i>

01:55:14.284 --> 01:55:16.369
<i>Matt Crane poses
quite a threat,</i>

01:55:16.452 --> 01:55:19.622
<i>especially now when Billy
has to be on the ropes.</i>

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.460
No, Gus. A curve
would hurt too much.

01:55:30.258 --> 01:55:33.344
<i>Ground ball to the right side,
smothered back at third base</i>

01:55:33.428 --> 01:55:36.139
<i>by Lee Giordano
and throws him out.</i>

01:55:36.222 --> 01:55:38.683
<i>That would be
another brilliant play.</i>

01:55:38.766 --> 01:55:41.019
<i>Look at this.
I'm talking about tremendous.</i>

01:55:41.102 --> 01:55:42.687
No! He beat it!

01:55:53.489 --> 01:55:56.451
<i>Two more outs to go,
and here's Jesus Cabrillo,</i>

01:55:56.534 --> 01:55:59.037
<i>who struck out
and flied to center.</i>

01:56:00.538 --> 01:56:04.125
<i>It's been over 40 years
that I sat at Yankee Stadium</i>

01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:07.086
<i>and broadcast the perfect game</i>

01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:09.631
<i>by Don Larsen
in the World Series.</i>

01:56:10.006 --> 01:56:13.051
<i>And now, I never thought I'd
be able to see another one,</i>

01:56:13.134 --> 01:56:15.678
<i>especially from
a 40-year-old pitcher</i>

01:56:15.762 --> 01:56:18.765
<i>who may very well be
at the end of his career.</i>

01:56:19.349 --> 01:56:21.893
Gus, god damn it, Gus,

01:56:21.976 --> 01:56:23.227
just hold it over
the middle of the plate.

01:56:23.311 --> 01:56:25.897
I'm throwing
straight shit right now.

01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:34.113
<i>Big swing.
And the count, 0 and 1.</i>

01:56:34.197 --> 01:56:36.240
What are you swinging at?
It was a ball!

01:56:36.324 --> 01:56:37.825
This guy's a bum!

01:56:51.506 --> 01:56:53.716
<i>There's a drive down the line.</i>

01:56:54.384 --> 01:56:57.136
<i>Foul.
What a scramble up there.</i>

01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.430
<i>What used to be
just a souvenir</i>

01:56:59.514 --> 01:57:03.434
<i>might very well turn out to be
a very valuable baseball.</i>

01:57:06.646 --> 01:57:08.189
Oh, God.

01:57:09.482 --> 01:57:11.609
Yeah, I know, I'm stalling.

01:57:13.569 --> 01:57:15.822
Everybody knows I'm stalling.

01:57:17.865 --> 01:57:20.076
Maybe you'd be stalling, too.

01:57:35.758 --> 01:57:38.678
<i>And there's
a strike three called.</i>

01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:43.141
<i>Billy Chapel striking out
Jesus Cabrillo
for his ninth strikeout.</i>

01:57:43.224 --> 01:57:46.269
<i>And he is one out away
from the perfect game.</i>

01:57:46.936 --> 01:57:48.354
Wreck it.

01:57:48.438 --> 01:57:49.814
All right, skip.

01:57:49.897 --> 01:57:52.567
<i>On deck is young Ken Strout,</i>

01:57:52.650 --> 01:57:55.528
<i>who will take his swings
for Jaime Ruiz.</i>

01:57:56.279 --> 01:57:58.030
<i>Batting for Ruiz.</i>

01:57:58.531 --> 01:58:01.617
<i>Number 60, Ken Strout.</i>

01:58:11.794 --> 01:58:13.129
Why not?

01:58:13.212 --> 01:58:15.673
<i>I think this is
a great move by Bobby Mack,</i>

01:58:15.757 --> 01:58:17.884
<i>the Yankee skipper,
sending a kid up.</i>

01:58:17.967 --> 01:58:20.136
<i>Ken Strout.
His first major league at bat.</i>

01:58:20.219 --> 01:58:22.388
<i>He's just young enough
and cocky enough</i>

01:58:22.472 --> 01:58:26.225
<i>to not realize the magnitude
of the situation that he's in.</i>

01:58:29.854 --> 01:58:32.857
<i>There's a line drive
down the right field line!</i>

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.817
<i>Hooking foul!</i>

01:58:35.151 --> 01:58:38.488
<i>And that was too close
for comfort for the Tigers</i>

01:58:38.571 --> 01:58:40.323
<i>and for Billy Chapel.</i>

01:58:45.161 --> 01:58:47.497
I don't scare you at all,
do I?

01:58:50.166 --> 01:58:52.168
Guess you forgot who I am.

01:58:58.174 --> 01:59:00.718
Think, Billy,
don't just throw.

01:59:00.802 --> 01:59:01.969
Think.

01:59:07.099 --> 01:59:10.353
No, curveball's for shit.
He knows it. I know it.

01:59:14.524 --> 01:59:16.567
He knows it.

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:21.155
This is gonna hurt
a little bit.

01:59:23.699 --> 01:59:24.784
Strike two!

01:59:24.867 --> 01:59:25.868
<i>What's that old line?</i>

01:59:25.952 --> 01:59:29.288
<i>"If you can keep your head
when all about
you are losing theirs,</i>

01:59:29.372 --> 01:59:31.374
<i>"you don't understand
the situation."</i>

01:59:31.457 --> 01:59:34.544
<i>That's Kenny Strout right now
as he takes another strike.</i>

01:59:34.627 --> 01:59:36.546
<i>And the count is 0 and 2.</i>

01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:40.466
<i>But with a weary body and,
no doubt, a sore arm.</i>

01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:43.678
<i>Now this big crowd,
over 56,000,</i>

01:59:43.761 --> 01:59:47.849
<i>rooting for Billy Chapel
to do the near impossible.</i>

01:59:50.893 --> 01:59:53.896
It's either gonna be
your night, kid, or mine.

01:59:55.982 --> 01:59:58.276
<i>Will this be the last
pitch of the game?</i>

01:59:58.359 --> 02:00:01.863
<i>Will this be the last pitch
in Billy Chapel's life?</i>

02:00:01.946 --> 02:00:04.991
<i>Will it be the end of his
brilliant major-league career?</i>

02:00:05.074 --> 02:00:07.618
<i>And, if so, what a high note.</i>

02:00:08.035 --> 02:00:10.913
<i>0 and 2 the count
to Kenny Strout.</i>

02:00:26.262 --> 02:00:27.555
Come on, Billy.

02:00:43.571 --> 02:00:47.074
<i>High bouncer!
Off the glove of Chapel!</i>

02:01:05.927 --> 02:01:06.928
He's out!

02:01:07.011 --> 02:01:08.596
<i>He has done it!</i>

02:01:10.973 --> 02:01:14.226
<i>Billy Chapel has pitched
a perfect game!</i>

02:01:14.477 --> 02:01:19.190
<i>The cathedral that is Yankee
Stadium belongs to a Chapel!</i>

02:01:38.542 --> 02:01:39.961
He was safe!

02:01:42.672 --> 02:01:45.424
Nice job, Chapel.
Got to give it to you.

02:01:45.925 --> 02:01:48.970
Nice job.
Come on, perfect game.

02:02:12.118 --> 02:02:14.912
I told you, Billy!
Didn't I tell you?

02:02:15.538 --> 02:02:16.998
History, man!

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.150
You're the cream
in my coffee.

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.611
That's okay. That's okay.

02:02:47.695 --> 02:02:50.239
You didn't know.
This is good right here.

02:02:50.322 --> 02:02:53.075
I'll just stay right here.
This is a good spot.

02:02:53.159 --> 02:02:55.578
Wait. I got to make
a phone call.

02:02:57.121 --> 02:03:00.166
Where are we? All right.

02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.049
You need anything?

02:03:09.341 --> 02:03:10.801
Some water.

02:03:17.933 --> 02:03:19.685
Thank you, Chappie.

02:03:19.935 --> 02:03:21.353
No problem.

02:03:23.355 --> 02:03:27.026
No, not for the water.

02:03:33.908 --> 02:03:35.117
I know.

02:03:37.119 --> 02:03:38.287
Okay.

02:04:08.359 --> 02:04:11.278
<i>Hello. You've reached
the hotel message center.</i>

02:04:11.445 --> 02:04:13.447
<i>There are no new messages.</i>

02:04:13.572 --> 02:04:17.118
<i>Thank you for using the hotel
message center. Goodbye.</i>

02:07:09.707 --> 02:07:12.584
I thought you had
already gone.

02:07:12.668 --> 02:07:16.088
I missed my plane. I had
to stay at the airport hotel.

02:07:17.381 --> 02:07:19.049
Missed your plane?

02:07:19.633 --> 02:07:21.760
There was this ball game on.

02:07:24.805 --> 02:07:26.181
You saw it?

02:07:26.807 --> 02:07:29.226
With a bunch of Yankee fans.

02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:31.061
Grown men crying.

02:07:31.145 --> 02:07:32.396
It was

02:07:33.897 --> 02:07:35.149
perfect.

02:07:36.275 --> 02:07:39.320
Heather saw it, too.
I called her at school.

02:07:40.988 --> 02:07:43.532
We were both
so proud of you, Billy.

02:07:49.705 --> 02:07:51.665
What are you doing here?

02:07:52.708 --> 02:07:54.043
I was...

02:07:55.419 --> 02:07:57.546
I was on my way to England.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:00.924
Why?

02:08:04.094 --> 02:08:05.929
Because you're there.

02:08:12.686 --> 02:08:14.355
God, I...

02:08:15.064 --> 02:08:16.815
I thought I was gonna have
an ocean to think about

02:08:16.899 --> 02:08:17.983
what I wanted to say to you,

02:08:18.067 --> 02:08:20.444
what I needed to say.

02:08:20.527 --> 02:08:21.612
Billy, you don't need to...

02:08:21.695 --> 02:08:23.155
Yes, I...

02:08:29.078 --> 02:08:32.206
I used to believe.
I mean, I still do

02:08:32.289 --> 02:08:36.168
that if you give something
your all, everything you have

02:08:36.251 --> 02:08:38.587
it doesn't matter
if you win or lose

02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:41.090
as long as you
risked everything,

02:08:41.173 --> 02:08:42.174
put everything out there.

02:08:43.592 --> 02:08:45.344
And I've done that.

02:08:46.845 --> 02:08:50.474
I did it in my life.
I did it with the game.

02:08:52.643 --> 02:08:54.311
But not with you.

02:08:56.063 --> 02:08:57.940
I never gave you that.

02:08:59.149 --> 02:09:00.651
And I'm sorry.

02:09:03.445 --> 02:09:05.030
Okay.

02:09:08.242 --> 02:09:09.701
I have to go.

02:09:14.289 --> 02:09:15.332
Jane.

02:09:15.416 --> 02:09:16.667
I've already missed
my plane once.

02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:17.793
I know. Listen. Listen.

02:09:17.876 --> 02:09:20.879
I know I'm
on really thin ice here,

02:09:21.755 --> 02:09:24.591
but when you said
that I didn't need you.

02:09:26.677 --> 02:09:28.846
Well, last night,

02:09:28.929 --> 02:09:33.100
that should have been
the biggest night of my life.

02:09:35.519 --> 02:09:37.479
It wasn't.

02:09:38.564 --> 02:09:40.315
It wasn't because

02:09:42.276 --> 02:09:44.361
you weren't there.

02:09:45.904 --> 02:09:49.241
So I just wanted to tell you

02:09:50.659 --> 02:09:54.663
not to change your mind
or keep you from going

02:09:54.746 --> 02:09:57.708
just so that you know

02:10:01.295 --> 02:10:02.796
that I know

02:10:08.635 --> 02:10:10.220
that I need you.

02:11:08.737 --> 02:11:10.364
I love you, Jane.

02:11:13.534 --> 02:11:15.285
I never believed it.

02:11:16.787 --> 02:11:18.163
Believe it.
