00:10.949 --> 00:12.143
<i>How did l get here?</i>

00:12.189 --> 00:14.703
<i>l turned around and there you were</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:17.388
<i>l didn't think twice or rationalise</i>

00:17.429 --> 00:20.501
<i>'cause somehow l knew</i>

00:20.549 --> 00:21.664
<i>That there was more...</i>

00:21.709 --> 00:26.829
Man, Miley is so lucky.
Her voice is so pure and natural and...

00:26.869 --> 00:30.464
<i>But l figured it's too good to be...</i>

00:32.069 --> 00:34.060
Okay, l know
l had a chilli dog for lunch,

00:34.109 --> 00:36.907
but there is no way that's me.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.382
Lola...

00:38.429 --> 00:40.067
Sorry! My bad.

00:44.509 --> 00:47.387
<i>You're one in a million</i>

00:47.429 --> 00:50.580
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

00:51.469 --> 00:52.822
<i>How'd that sound, Dad?</i>

00:52.869 --> 00:54.302
<i>Perfect.</i>

00:54.989 --> 00:57.139
That is such a great song!

00:57.189 --> 00:59.100
Have l told you
it's my mom's favourite?

00:59.149 --> 01:02.186
Hey, here's a wacky idea!
Her birthday's coming up.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.221
Maybe you could make
a special kind of personal recording,

01:05.269 --> 01:08.341
and l could give it to her as a present?

01:08.389 --> 01:11.222
You spent all her gift money
on those shoes, didn't you?

01:11.269 --> 01:13.863
They didn't have them in her size.

01:13.909 --> 01:17.618
l hear you. Last Christmas,
l bought Daddy these earrings.

01:18.629 --> 01:21.462
-See? This is why we're friends.
-Exactly.

01:21.509 --> 01:23.181
So, you'll do it? You'll record the song?

01:23.229 --> 01:24.787
Nope, you will.

01:26.829 --> 01:28.660
You're not kidding.

01:28.709 --> 01:33.464
No, kidding is when l tell my dad that
he looks good in that dorky moustache.

01:33.509 --> 01:35.898
<i>Your mike's still on, darling.</i>

01:36.469 --> 01:37.902
Love you!

01:39.349 --> 01:43.945
Lilly, to really make this special,
you're gonna have to record the song.

01:43.989 --> 01:45.627
But l don't have a voice like yours.

01:45.669 --> 01:49.059
You'll be surprised what you can
sound like in a professional studio.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.339
Trust me, you're gonna sound great.

01:51.389 --> 01:52.617
Okay.

01:53.709 --> 01:57.418
<i>One in a million</i>

02:00.949 --> 02:03.543
So, do you think my mom will like it?

02:04.069 --> 02:05.787
<i>Like it?</i>

02:05.829 --> 02:08.866
<i>She's gonna be speechless,
right, Dad?</i>

02:10.749 --> 02:12.421
<i>You see?</i>

02:20.149 --> 02:21.821
<i>come on!</i>

02:21.869 --> 02:25.862
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:25.909 --> 02:29.458
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe
every colour</i>

02:29.509 --> 02:33.138
<i>Yeah, when you're famous
it can be kind of fun</i>

02:33.189 --> 02:38.058
<i>lt's really you
but no one ever discovers</i>

02:38.109 --> 02:41.579
<i>Who would have thought
that a girl like me</i>

02:41.629 --> 02:45.019
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:47.029 --> 02:50.908
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:50.949 --> 02:52.985
<i>chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:53.029 --> 02:54.781
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:54.829 --> 02:58.947
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:58.989 --> 03:00.661
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:00.709 --> 03:03.826
<i>And you know that
it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:08.149 --> 03:11.141
<i>They say that good things take time</i>

03:13.389 --> 03:18.019
<i>But really great things happen
in the blink of an eye</i>

03:18.069 --> 03:22.187
<i>Thought the chances to meet
somebody like you were a million...</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:24.143
l haven't felt this queasy

03:24.189 --> 03:27.101
since my grandpa dragged me
into that shirts and skins b-ball game

03:27.149 --> 03:29.617
at the seniors' centre.

03:29.669 --> 03:32.706
The skin was bouncing
more than the ball.

03:32.749 --> 03:36.628
l could've lived my whole life
without that picture in my head.

03:36.669 --> 03:38.944
You're not actually going
to give this to her, are you?

03:38.989 --> 03:42.106
Of course not.
l'm going to give her this one.

03:43.989 --> 03:49.109
<i>They say that good things take time</i>

03:49.149 --> 03:51.219
<i>But really great things happen...</i>

03:51.269 --> 03:55.547
Wow, a little reverb, some overlay.
Nice.

03:56.709 --> 04:01.066
Daddy called it
''Extreme Mix-over. Lilly Edition.''

04:03.909 --> 04:06.423
Now she'll never know
how unbelievably...

04:06.469 --> 04:09.506
-Hi, hi.
-Completely wonderful she is!

04:09.549 --> 04:11.824
Listen to you, you singer, you!

04:13.829 --> 04:15.103
<i>One in a million...</i>

04:15.149 --> 04:18.937
Oh, my gosh! l'm fantastic!

04:20.469 --> 04:22.664
Almost too good to believe.

04:25.029 --> 04:26.382
But not.

04:27.189 --> 04:29.384
My mom is gonna be so blown away.

04:29.429 --> 04:33.138
l got to tell you, l was a little nervous.
Nobody in my family can really sing.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.022
Yeah, heredity's a powerful thing.

04:38.469 --> 04:40.699
For instance,
my mom's feet always hurt,

04:40.749 --> 04:42.626
and now so do mine.

04:43.309 --> 04:46.346
Hey, why don't you just listen
to the headphones?

04:46.389 --> 04:48.698
You know, get the full effect.

04:50.909 --> 04:53.218
l'm trying to do a nice thing here.

04:53.269 --> 04:55.385
Lilly's happy,
her mom's gonna be happy,

04:55.429 --> 04:56.498
who's it gonna hurt?

04:56.549 --> 04:59.586
<i>You're one in a million...</i>

05:01.589 --> 05:03.659
Any creature with ears.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:19.909 --> 05:21.103
Yeah.

05:22.469 --> 05:25.267
Go ahead and look,
but you can't touch.

05:27.309 --> 05:28.344
Dude, what happened to you?

05:28.389 --> 05:31.904
Did you get lost
on the way to the bullfight?

05:31.949 --> 05:33.064
Go ahead and joke,

05:33.109 --> 05:36.624
but my father won my mother's heart
dressed like this.

05:37.149 --> 05:38.548
Your father's a billionaire.

05:38.589 --> 05:42.059
He could've dressed like a duck
and won her heart.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.781
And what died on your lip?

05:43.829 --> 05:46.024
Stop it! She'll see.

05:47.149 --> 05:49.140
This is all for Sarah?

05:49.189 --> 05:52.943
Come on, Rico,
what'd that poor girl ever do to you?

05:53.309 --> 05:55.265
She stole my heart!

05:56.109 --> 06:00.148
l just wish l had someone
who could find out if she likes me, too.

06:00.189 --> 06:04.944
A friend, a pal,
an easily replaceable employee.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.258
All right, fine. But lose the 'stache,

06:08.309 --> 06:10.504
or the next thing you know,
she inhales it during a kiss,

06:10.549 --> 06:12.187
you become the laughingstock
of the school,

06:12.229 --> 06:15.778
and you're forced to move
from Tennessee to California.

06:16.469 --> 06:18.585
Believe me, it can happen.

06:21.389 --> 06:23.107
Hey, Sarah. Nice pose.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.788
Thanks. lt aligns my chakras.

06:25.829 --> 06:29.583
Well, you're gonna be in for a chakra
when you hear what l have to say.

06:29.629 --> 06:34.259
The President got my letter and agreed
to give Arizona back to the Apaches?

06:34.309 --> 06:36.539
This'll go a lot faster
if you just stop talking.

06:36.589 --> 06:37.624
Okay.

06:37.669 --> 06:40.467
Look, there's this guy
who really likes you,

06:40.509 --> 06:43.307
but he's kind of shy,
and he doesn't want to say anything

06:43.349 --> 06:45.465
until he knows
whether you like him, too.

06:45.509 --> 06:48.945
Oh, my gosh!
Does this guy go to my school?

06:49.669 --> 06:50.704
Yeah.

06:50.749 --> 06:54.025
And is he maybe
not the tallest guy around?

06:54.669 --> 06:55.818
Yeah.

06:55.869 --> 06:58.258
Jackson! l like you, too!

06:59.989 --> 07:01.308
No, l...

07:13.629 --> 07:16.507
Okay, okay, all ninth graders, listen up!

07:17.469 --> 07:21.826
The circus l hired for the freshmen
fundraiser is no longer available.

07:24.469 --> 07:29.827
Last night, the fire-eater had a bad taco
and burped the place to the ground.

07:30.949 --> 07:32.587
But no worries.

07:32.629 --> 07:36.986
One of our very own has come up
with a brilliant, last-minute substitution.

07:37.029 --> 07:42.865
<i>Karaoke night</i>

07:42.909 --> 07:45.582
Night! Karaoke night! They get it.

07:48.309 --> 07:50.504
For admission, you get food, drink,

07:50.549 --> 07:53.188
and the chance to get up there
and be compared to...

07:53.229 --> 07:56.107
<i>Me</i>

07:56.149 --> 07:58.219
You! You. They get it.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.667
Well, now l know not all of us can sing
as well as some people.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.301
Stop pointing.

08:03.909 --> 08:08.619
But l still expect to see everybody here
and singing on Saturday night!

08:09.869 --> 08:13.703
Hey, it's either this or a car wash.

08:13.749 --> 08:18.345
And, trust me, you don't want to see
this business in a wet T-shirt.

08:20.429 --> 08:22.897
Hey, Miley, if you're too gutless to sing,

08:22.949 --> 08:25.702
you can always go up there
and do one of your pig calls.

08:25.749 --> 08:29.503
You mean like this?
''Amber, Ashley, get in here!''

08:31.309 --> 08:33.061
Boo-yah!

08:34.509 --> 08:37.227
That's weird. Her pigs have our names.

08:41.469 --> 08:42.504
Real mature.

08:42.549 --> 08:45.700
Exactly what we'd expect
from the tone-deaf twins!

08:45.749 --> 08:48.104
-ln your face!
-ln your face!

08:49.589 --> 08:53.059
Well, what you don't know is that
l happen to have a really great voice.

08:53.109 --> 08:56.101
What? No! Lilly, you can't sing...

08:57.269 --> 08:59.419
Up there, with Amber!

08:59.469 --> 09:00.538
Why not?

09:00.589 --> 09:02.580
Because l'm coming down
with something,

09:02.629 --> 09:05.189
and l just gave it to you, sorry.

09:06.069 --> 09:09.459
You two are coming down
with something, all right. Chicken pox.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.625
Emphasis on the chicken!

09:11.669 --> 09:14.263
l put the emphasis on the chicken!

09:14.909 --> 09:16.262
What are you so worried about?

09:16.309 --> 09:18.140
You heard that CD, l can take her!

09:18.189 --> 09:21.465
Hey, check this, Twitney Houston,
l'm gonna sing you off that stage.

09:21.509 --> 09:23.386
Oh, it is so on!

09:23.429 --> 09:26.182
l'll see you Saturday night,
Smelly Clarkson!

09:26.229 --> 09:28.459
You heard her, Celine Peon.

09:29.909 --> 09:33.219
You can't ''Celine Peon''
after l ''Smelly Clarkson.''

09:34.069 --> 09:35.263
This is gonna be so great!

09:35.309 --> 09:37.982
When she hears my voice,
she's gonna freak!

09:38.029 --> 09:40.418
She ain't the only one, honey.

09:49.109 --> 09:50.940
Hit me again, Marty.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.017
And this time, leave the carton.

09:57.109 --> 10:00.897
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Sarah stealer,

10:00.949 --> 10:02.348
the babe bandit!

10:02.389 --> 10:05.142
Look, Rico, she came on to me.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.941
Do you really think
l want a 1 4-year-old girlfriend

10:06.989 --> 10:10.504
whose idea of a hot date is
snuggling around a campfire

10:10.549 --> 10:13.143
roasting gluten-free marshmallows?

10:13.869 --> 10:16.099
l don't care what you want.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.698
All l care about is Sarah
and her happiness.

10:20.349 --> 10:24.581
That's why l need you to crush her
and send her crawling back to me.

10:24.629 --> 10:28.338
Look, l am not gonna break her heart.
l'll find another way.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.983
And aren't you lactose intolerant?

10:32.309 --> 10:34.061
What's it to you?

10:34.709 --> 10:38.941
Hey, Jackson! This weekend,
want to go get typhoid shots together?

10:40.269 --> 10:42.499
Why would l want to do that?

10:42.549 --> 10:43.664
So we don't get typhoid

10:43.709 --> 10:48.385
when we go to build alternative
housing in Tanzania, you silly goose.

10:48.429 --> 10:49.623
Bye!

10:51.549 --> 10:55.337
l should be the one risking
infectious disease in Tanzania!

10:56.629 --> 10:58.426
No arguments here.

11:13.589 --> 11:18.379
<i>Try to hit all of the notes</i>

11:18.789 --> 11:22.702
<i>l'm hitting all of the notes</i>

11:25.669 --> 11:30.265
Miley, we've been at this for an hour.
l don't want to damage my voice.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.823
Trust me, that ain't gonna happen.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.667
l don't even know why l need to do
these stupid exercises.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.984
We both know
l'm going to blow Amber off the stage.

11:39.029 --> 11:40.985
This isn't about Amber.

11:41.029 --> 11:43.907
This is about you being
the best you can be.

11:43.949 --> 11:45.541
But l'm already the best l can be.

11:45.589 --> 11:47.147
l hope not.

11:48.389 --> 11:51.745
l mean, there's always room
for improvement, right?

11:52.309 --> 11:53.742
Hey, Lilly.

11:54.349 --> 11:56.260
How'd your mom like
her birthday present?

11:56.309 --> 12:00.461
<i>She loved it</i>

12:02.309 --> 12:04.903
Did you play it for her or sing it?

12:06.349 --> 12:08.817
She played it, her mom loved it,

12:08.869 --> 12:12.623
and now Lilly has challenged Amber
to a sing-off

12:12.669 --> 12:15.342
in front of the whole ninth grade.

12:15.749 --> 12:18.388
<i>Yep. l'm gonna sing l Got Nerve.</i>

12:18.429 --> 12:19.908
You sure do.

12:20.829 --> 12:22.342
Help me.

12:22.389 --> 12:27.144
You know, Lilly, your voice reminds me
of another great singer.

12:27.189 --> 12:29.498
Really? Who? BeyoncÃ©? Shakira?

12:29.549 --> 12:31.505
-Johnny Cash.
-Really?

12:33.069 --> 12:37.426
Yeah, you just got something
really special about your voice,

12:37.469 --> 12:39.300
something honest.

12:40.149 --> 12:42.379
Where're you going with this, cowboy?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.262
Now, you see what Johnny does
is he talks his songs.

12:45.309 --> 12:46.583
Brilliant...

12:47.829 --> 12:48.864
...ly.

12:49.189 --> 12:52.067
He talks his songs brilliantly.

12:52.829 --> 12:55.901
<i>We haven't met
but that's okay</i>

12:55.949 --> 12:59.624
<i>'cause l know you will be asking
for me someday</i>

13:02.469 --> 13:03.743
Chills.

13:04.669 --> 13:07.137
-Okay, what's going on?
-Nothing!

13:08.349 --> 13:11.421
-Got anything else?
-Can she rap?

13:11.469 --> 13:13.903
Hello! Still in the room!

13:15.429 --> 13:18.944
-Daddy, maybe it's time that...
-Leave? lf you insist.

13:20.229 --> 13:22.743
l was gonna say, ''Tell her the truth.''

13:22.789 --> 13:24.268
Coward!

13:25.509 --> 13:26.737
Hello.

13:27.909 --> 13:29.388
What truth?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.108
This...

13:33.709 --> 13:37.145
<i>Help me before l get used to this guy...</i>

13:39.269 --> 13:41.829
What did you do to my voice?

13:41.869 --> 13:44.622
On this CD, nothing.

13:45.949 --> 13:48.941
On the one you gave your mom...a lot.

13:51.269 --> 13:53.260
You re-mixed me?

13:55.229 --> 13:58.699
Technology. Gotta love it, huh?

13:59.549 --> 14:02.017
Oh, man, so this is how
l'm gonna sound

14:02.069 --> 14:04.185
in front of the whole ninth grade?

14:04.229 --> 14:05.787
Thanks a lot.

14:06.189 --> 14:09.818
Lilly! l'm sorry.
l was just trying to do something nice.

14:09.869 --> 14:11.700
Like what, ruin my life?

14:11.749 --> 14:13.626
lf l don't sing,
Amber makes a fool out of me,

14:13.669 --> 14:16.467
and if l do sing, l make a fool out of me.

14:16.509 --> 14:20.582
What do you want from me?
lf l could loan you my voice, l would.

14:25.029 --> 14:26.303
Hit it.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.462
Sorry. l like to go for a big finish.

14:36.469 --> 14:38.903
-You'll take what l give you.
-Yes, ma'am.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.542
Jackson!

14:49.069 --> 14:50.980
Jackson, what're you doing?

14:51.029 --> 14:56.228
Just locking in perfection, baby.
l call it ''shellacsing the Jackson.''

14:57.189 --> 14:59.987
Gorgeous and water-resistant
to 200 metres.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.384
But aerosol sprays
are ruining our ozone.

15:02.429 --> 15:04.545
Aren't you worried
about global warming?

15:04.589 --> 15:08.138
So my grandkids will never see
a polar bear, big whoop.

15:08.629 --> 15:12.747
l never got to see a dinosaur.
You don't see me crying about it.

15:13.349 --> 15:15.260
Oh, man, l'm all out.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.707
You can't just leave those there.

15:18.749 --> 15:22.059
They have to be properly disposed of
in a hazardous waste facility.

15:22.109 --> 15:27.103
l've got a hazardous waste facility.
l call it the Pacific Ocean.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.108
-But that'll pollute our beaches!
-l don't care.

15:31.149 --> 15:33.504
Aren't l horrible?
You should break up with me.

15:33.549 --> 15:36.302
Break up with you?
You need me now more than ever.

15:36.349 --> 15:38.817
-What?
-This is perfect!

15:38.869 --> 15:41.064
l was feeling guilty
about spending time with you

15:41.109 --> 15:42.781
when l could be saving the world,

15:42.829 --> 15:46.947
but now by spending time with you,
l will be saving the world!

15:48.349 --> 15:50.146
Your hair hurts.

15:50.189 --> 15:53.340
All right, look, look,
l don't have a crush on you.

15:53.389 --> 15:54.742
l never had a crush on you.

15:54.789 --> 15:57.349
When l came to talk to you,
l was talking about Rico.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.857
He's the one who likes you.

15:59.909 --> 16:01.740
He doesn't look like he likes me.

16:01.789 --> 16:03.427
Sweet niblets!

16:03.469 --> 16:06.427
Excuse me. What are you doing?

16:06.469 --> 16:09.267
Chilling with my new girl, Rosalita.

16:09.309 --> 16:12.779
But what about Sarah?
You were nuts about her.

16:12.829 --> 16:15.741
l was. Until l met Rosalita.

16:15.789 --> 16:17.666
Sarah!

16:17.709 --> 16:20.303
Rosalita!

16:20.349 --> 16:22.385
Sarah!

16:22.429 --> 16:26.786
Rosalita!

16:26.829 --> 16:28.581
Ain't love grand?

16:30.909 --> 16:32.820
-Look, Sarah, l'm really...
-lt's okay.

16:32.869 --> 16:35.622
lt's obvious
you weren't emotionally ready for me.

16:35.669 --> 16:38.502
Yes! Yes.
Thank you for understanding.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.665
That's why l'll wait.

16:40.709 --> 16:44.782
l waited six years for the California
low-flow toilet initiative,

16:44.829 --> 16:46.899
and l can wait for you.

16:46.949 --> 16:48.098
Bye!

16:49.189 --> 16:52.738
But l'm not worth waiting for!
Ask anybody!

16:52.789 --> 16:54.222
-Yeah.
-Yep.

16:55.469 --> 16:57.699
Okay. She gets it. Thanks.

17:01.029 --> 17:04.578
<i>We all want to believe in love</i>

17:04.628 --> 17:08.463
<i>We all want to believe in something</i>

17:09.549 --> 17:11.858
Oh, man, she sounds good.

17:11.909 --> 17:13.900
Yeah, but you're gonna sound better.

17:13.949 --> 17:17.224
Oliver's got this mike patched into
the same frequency as the stage mike.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.146
So l'll be singing in here,
your mouth moves out there,

17:20.189 --> 17:22.020
and Amber's mouth just does this...

17:23.868 --> 17:27.828
Got it. Remember, l like a big finish.

17:27.868 --> 17:30.429
l remember. Just go and have fun!

17:30.949 --> 17:33.179
Singers. They're all divas.

17:38.149 --> 17:41.425
There ain't nothing itsy-bitsy
about you, big boy.

17:41.829 --> 17:45.219
<i>We all want to believe in love</i>

17:45.269 --> 17:49.865
<i>We all want to believe in something</i>

17:49.909 --> 17:54.585
<i>Bigger than us</i>

17:56.869 --> 17:59.941
<i>Thank you, thank you.
l was good, wasn't l?</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:06.180
<i>That's the always humble
Amber Addison with Bigger Than Us.</i>

18:07.869 --> 18:09.188
<i>All right, who's next?</i>

18:09.229 --> 18:10.947
-No way.
-Not me.

18:11.989 --> 18:17.427
Boy, l sure wouldn't want to go up there
and sing after someone that wonderful!

18:17.469 --> 18:19.937
Who could possibly follow Amber?

18:20.669 --> 18:24.708
<i>l believe the gauntlet
has been thrown down!</i>

18:24.749 --> 18:27.138
<i>Will Lilly Truscott pick it up?</i>

18:28.069 --> 18:29.821
Give me that mike.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.304
-You've got guts, kid.
-That's not all l've got.

18:35.349 --> 18:37.658
l got nerve! Hit it, Oliver!

18:40.109 --> 18:43.340
<i>We haven't met
but that's okay</i>

18:43.389 --> 18:46.665
<i>'cause you will be asking
for Lilly one day</i>

18:46.709 --> 18:48.108
<i>Don't want to wait...</i>

18:48.149 --> 18:49.821
l didn't know she had a voice like that.

18:49.869 --> 18:51.985
-She sounds exactly like...
-Shut up!

18:52.029 --> 18:55.704
But she's amazing! Amazingly bad!

18:59.869 --> 19:02.508
<i>And l think that l can shake you</i>

19:02.549 --> 19:05.063
<i>l know where l stand
l know who l am</i>

19:05.109 --> 19:08.784
<i>l would never run away
when life gets bad, it's</i>

19:08.829 --> 19:11.389
<i>Everything l see
Every part of me</i>

19:11.429 --> 19:15.217
<i>Gonna get what l deserve</i>

19:15.269 --> 19:16.702
<i>l got...</i>

19:16.749 --> 19:18.148
<i>Spider!</i>

19:20.149 --> 19:24.028
<i>Electrified, l'm on a wire</i>

19:24.069 --> 19:28.221
<i>Getting together, we're on fire</i>

19:28.269 --> 19:31.898
<i>What l said you heard</i>

19:31.949 --> 19:34.986
<i>Now l got you spinning</i>

19:35.029 --> 19:38.738
<i>Don't close your mind</i>

19:38.789 --> 19:41.349
<i>The words l use are open...</i>

19:48.749 --> 19:51.980
-Yeah, you got nerve, all right.
-Just no talent!

19:59.909 --> 20:03.265
-Lilly! l am so sorry.
-Come on. Let's just get out of here.

20:03.309 --> 20:06.540
Lilly, hold up.
What're you guys laughing at?

20:06.589 --> 20:08.580
At least she had the guts
to get up there.

20:08.629 --> 20:11.382
Even though
she did completely humiliate herself.

20:11.429 --> 20:13.226
Thank you! Come on.

20:13.269 --> 20:15.339
No, Oliver's right.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.904
She did humiliate herself.

20:19.549 --> 20:23.940
l think they heard it the first time!
What kind of friend are you?

20:24.349 --> 20:27.307
The kind l should've been all along.

20:28.189 --> 20:30.464
Sure, Lilly doesn't have a great voice.

20:30.509 --> 20:34.343
Most of us don't, but does that mean
that we shouldn't sing?

20:34.909 --> 20:36.945
Yeah. Now who wants to hear me?

20:36.989 --> 20:40.345
<i>Amber, let's not interrupt.</i>

20:41.749 --> 20:43.740
<i>carry on, l beg you.</i>

20:44.589 --> 20:46.944
Singing shouldn't be
about showing people up.

20:46.989 --> 20:51.301
lt should be about having a great time
no matter what you sound like.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.019
And l should've known that.

20:57.069 --> 21:00.266
Lilly, l'm sorry.
l should've never messed with that CD.

21:00.309 --> 21:04.587
Your mom would've loved it,
just because it came from you.

21:05.429 --> 21:07.704
Yeah, she is a big mush ball.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.938
<i>So, who wants to come up here
and have a good time?</i>

21:11.989 --> 21:15.743
Go up there.
Show them the real Lilly Truscott.

21:15.789 --> 21:18.542
-l think she's pretty great.
-Thanks.

21:19.429 --> 21:21.420
Mr Corelli, l want a do over.

21:21.469 --> 21:22.902
<i>You got it.</i>

21:23.789 --> 21:26.826
Hey, Lilly! Don't forget your big finish.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.702
<i>With a new attitude
everything can change</i>

21:33.749 --> 21:36.582
<i>Make it how you want it to be</i>

21:36.629 --> 21:39.939
<i>Staying mad, why do that?
Give yourself a break</i>

21:39.989 --> 21:42.822
<i>Laugh about it and you'll see</i>

21:44.349 --> 21:47.386
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

21:47.429 --> 21:49.989
<i>So let's make it rock</i>

21:50.029 --> 21:51.098
<i>Make it rock...</i>

21:51.149 --> 21:53.743
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

21:53.789 --> 21:57.099
<i>So come on, come on, come on
Everybody now...</i>

22:02.029 --> 22:04.065
<i>So let's make it rock!</i>

22:05.869 --> 22:08.463
Congratulations, you're the best singer
in the school.

22:08.509 --> 22:10.386
Too bad nobody cares.

22:11.629 --> 22:12.857
Yeah!

22:17.549 --> 22:18.698
No.

22:19.229 --> 22:21.538
Oh, yeah. We do this...
