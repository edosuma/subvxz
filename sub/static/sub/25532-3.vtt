WEBVTT

00:14.389 --> 00:15.474
Come on! Come on!

01:04.313 --> 01:05.816
Dear...

01:07.276 --> 01:08.986
Oh. No, no, no!

01:31.341 --> 01:34.094
I... O... U...

01:34.177 --> 01:36.221
paper.

01:59.745 --> 02:00.746
Yes!

02:09.211 --> 02:12.257
I am allowing you to go on this trip
against my better judgment.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.052
Marilla, I assure you
that once I return from this adventure,

02:15.135 --> 02:17.012
you'll realize your decision was correct!

02:17.471 --> 02:18.347
Adventure?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.266
Not an adventure... per se.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.769
A... a restrained travel endeavor
for personal edification

02:23.852 --> 02:25.729
and familial socialization.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.815
And Gilbert's letter will be sent
across the sea to lands unknown.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.984
Do not put me in a position
of having to defend

02:31.068 --> 02:33.278
- any disruptive behavior to Mrs. Barry.
- Understood.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.489
The Barrys are traveling there
for important business.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.783
- Double-understood.
- Any foolishness will have consequ...

02:39.576 --> 02:41.912
I will be as calm
as the Lake of Shining Waters

02:41.995 --> 02:44.873
on a sunny day or a moonlit night,

02:44.956 --> 02:47.167
depending on your preference.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.589
Diana!

02:56.593 --> 03:00.806
I suppose it'll be beneficial...
to have some quiet time to think.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.433
About the future, you mean?

03:03.517 --> 03:07.396
The boarders.
And how long they need to stay.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.398
We could...

03:09.481 --> 03:10.524
Hello!

03:10.607 --> 03:12.693
We could go over the books together.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.199
- Mr. Barry.
- It's very kind of you to allow Anne

03:19.282 --> 03:22.119
to accompany you on your trip
to Charlottetown.

03:22.202 --> 03:26.540
Aunt Josephine expressed her enthusiasm
for seeing Anne again rather forcefully.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.333
We couldn't possibly disappoint her.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.336
You're certain about your decision
to forego the testing of the soil

03:31.420 --> 03:34.548
- here at Green Gables?
- Yeah. We're decided.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.301
Shame to miss out on a golden opportunity.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.095
We have enough, Mr. Barry.

03:40.178 --> 03:44.558
That's for... her train fare.
That's both ways.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.644
- You sure? We were... we're happy to...
- Darling, leave well enough alone.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.647
- We'd best be on our way.
- Of course.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.777
Good day, Marilla, Matthew.
We'll take good care of dear Anne.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.654
Thank you. Safe travels.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.579
Bye, Matthew! Bye, Marilla!

04:05.662 --> 04:07.998
- Goodbye.
- Bye now. Safe travels.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
Know anything about this?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.518
- About...?
- Paper.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.229
There something you wanna tell me?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.856
I'm staying here. After the grift.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.069
Uh... you're a laugh riot.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
I'm staying. For good.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.156
What the hell?
You setting me up, Jonesey?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.325
I'm asking you
for a gentleman's agreement.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.078
When Barry gets back,
we split the 1,700 bucks,

05:28.161 --> 05:29.955
shake hands, part ways.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.084
Rat me out and walk away
with the entire kitty? No sale.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.462
When we're done here, we're done.
Deal is:

05:37.546 --> 05:41.216
I get my inheritance
and I don't know a thing.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.886
- How long you been planning this?
- I don't know.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.599
- Since we arrived?
- No. It's just... I belong here.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.852
What makes you think these people
are going to accept you?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.689
Haven't you been paying attention?
They already have.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.191
You're not gonna ruin this for me.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.695
We both get what we want.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.214
Is everything all right?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.219
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.014
I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.295
Oh!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.973
I didn't realize Anne was already off
to Charlottetown.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.433
I was hoping to say goodbye.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.562
I believe this belongs to you.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.692
And I wonder if this is also yours.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.488
Mm, no. I was never much of a drinker.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.824
Perhaps it's Mr. Dunlop's?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.829
The poor man seems to have picked up
some nasty habits

08:15.912 --> 08:18.039
from his days as a soldier.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.041
War can poison a man's mind.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.335
Allow me to rid you of this filth.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.938
I'm bored.
When are we gonna be there?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.858
Mr. Barry, I know it's indecorous
to ask about financial matters,

08:44.941 --> 08:48.069
but I'm so curious
about this gold business!

08:48.153 --> 08:51.448
- Yeah. Well, what would you like to know?
- Where to start?!

08:51.531 --> 08:54.868
Well, I'm bewitched by this notion of how
money moves from country to country.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.871
- It seems like magic.
- I can see how you'd perceive it that way.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.831
Minnie May, please be careful.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.834
So your money travels
from England to Charlottetown?

09:02.917 --> 09:06.379
It's like a telegram,
but with cash instead of words.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.298
You must be receiving a substantial amount

09:08.381 --> 09:11.092
since you're not only testing
your soil for gold, but you're also...

09:11.176 --> 09:13.303
There'll be enough
for many, many Avonlea families

09:13.386 --> 09:14.971
to test the value of their land.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.641
I believe a rising tide
should lift all boats.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.186
Then you'll distribute the money
to those in town

09:21.269 --> 09:23.980
- who want their soil tested as well?
- The money goes to Nathaniel.

09:24.064 --> 09:28.777
He collects it directly in order
to expedite the process for everyone.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.863
Mr. Barry doesn't usually discuss
our finances.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.199
Today's your lucky day, Anne.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.077
- Ow! Stop it!
- Minnie May,

09:37.160 --> 09:39.245
please be respectful
of where everyone is sitting.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.789
Know your place.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.668
Sorry, Mother.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.923
Minnie May,
for heaven's sake!

10:08.441 --> 10:09.609
Hey, kid.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.446
You still learning how to spell?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.827
So?

10:19.369 --> 10:22.914
Y-E-S, or N-O?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.126
Yes.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.585
Hmm.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.841
What, you've never seen booze before?

10:33.508 --> 10:34.592
Aren't you a Frenchy?

10:34.676 --> 10:36.636
Thought they started you early
on this stuff.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.473
We don't keep alcohol in the house.
Um, we're... we're Catholic.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.061
C'mere.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.068
Come... Sit with me.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.906
Sit with me, little froggy!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.293
There we are.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.505
And there you go. Hmm?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.592
Drink up. It'll make
the work go faster.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.343
- No, thank you.
- Hmm?

11:17.427 --> 11:18.761
Have a taste.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.889
What, you scared?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.308
- No.
- Then drink.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.436
Come on, it'll put hair on your chest.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.315
Um, I should get back to work.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.114
Yeah.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.455
Yeah, you're too young to drink.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.066
Minnie May!
This is your final warning!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.957
Jerry.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.084
I'm sorry, Mr. Cuthbert.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.087
What are you... what are you sorry for?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.925
I know I made a hardship for you
in Charlottetown.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.136
Back at Christmastime?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.847
When I lost the...
the money from the horse.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.684
If... if I'd been smarter...

12:47.767 --> 12:50.186
if I'd been more... more careful...

12:52.397 --> 12:55.274
may-maybe I could've run away
from them.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.489
Are you talking about the men
who beat you up?

13:01.572 --> 13:03.533
Why are you thinking about that now?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.785
I... I should've stopped them!

13:07.704 --> 13:08.830
No.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.208
They were... they were grown men.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.210
They're bad men.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.879
Not your fault.

13:16.963 --> 13:21.426
Yes, it is. If I hadn't lost the money,
you wouldn't have to take in the boarders.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.638
You didn't do anything wrong, my son.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.817
Never mind now. Never mind.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.944
Never mind.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.886
Oh!

14:06.346 --> 14:08.681
Oh.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.433
Anything the matter?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.060
I don't know.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.772
Is anything the matter with you?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.068
I dunno.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.824
Jerry, he's, um...

14:27.742 --> 14:29.369
he's troubled about the boarders.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.498
He's not the only one.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.887
Thank you for helping me send this,
Rollings.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.806
Official-looking correspondence.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.017
It was important to me that the form
of the letter match its contents.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.019
This could be life-changing for Gilbert.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.523
Well, Rollings will investigate the boy's
whereabouts, won't you, Rollings?

14:58.606 --> 15:01.651
- I've said I would, yes.
- If he is indeed on a steamship,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.152
it shouldn't be too much trouble

15:03.236 --> 15:05.780
to discover which one
and where it will dock next.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.449
I may need to spread a few coins
in the process.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.661
Yes, yes,
grease whatever palms you need to.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.665
Ah... to think that my words
will be sent across an ocean,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.000
delivering news of gold!

15:19.919 --> 15:21.754
Is that the gold certificate?

15:22.839 --> 15:26.092
Did Nathaniel want me to have it
for my banking transaction? Hmm?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.511
- No...
- It's a letter, sir.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.346
The one we've just discussed.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.474
At length. Moments ago.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.893
- Rollings.
- Well, it looks like it.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.772
Perhaps you're overtired, dear.
Best to set that aside.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.317
It's medicinal.

15:48.114 --> 15:48.948
Ahem.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.367
Time to retire. Come along, dear.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.706
- Come along, Minnie May.
- Night-night.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.380
You ask me,

16:04.464 --> 16:07.300
this gold business is a load of hogwash.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.303
Though it is my fond hope that I'm wrong.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.431
- Why do you say that?
- The tenor of it all reminds me

16:13.514 --> 16:16.267
of another town that had gold fever.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.520
- Here on Prince Edward Island?
- Yes, a town up north.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.105
Cape Wolfe.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.232
About a decade ago, I think.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.111
I don't remember the details,
but I remember the mood.

16:27.195 --> 16:30.114
- What happened?
- Nothing. It was a bust.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.992
- Have you told Father?
- Oh... Ha, ha...

16:33.075 --> 16:35.328
He's never taken kindly to my advice.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.996
About anything.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.916
Oh, uh, as I recall,

16:39.999 --> 16:43.586
it was a story that was covered
in <i>The Island Announcer.</i>

16:43.669 --> 16:48.341
Newspaper articles about the gold,
and then the unfortunate lack of it.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.802
Oh, it ran for weeks. Quite the fiasco.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.556
Father's convinced of it.
He says this is a very exciting prospect.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.643
I'm sure he's done his due diligence.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
Good harvest.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.656
Merciful Lord.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.327
We have a bit of a cushion... now.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.830
Even after... paying back the bank.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.546
No real need for extra income, then.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.799
No real need.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.681
Be nice to have things a bit more...
quiet again.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.892
- And back to normal.
- Yeah.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.770
It would indeed.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.945
I can't stop thinking about
the terrible possibility of "gold fever."

17:51.779 --> 17:54.740
It sounds so... feverish.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.200
Don't get a fever.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.036
Otherwise, you're gonna get smelly onions
on your feet.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.331
It's worrisome.
We need more information.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.959
If only there was a way
to read those old articles.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.170
Diana...

18:09.046 --> 18:12.216
What if tomorrow we E-S-C-A-P-E

18:12.300 --> 18:14.093
so we can V-I-S-I-T...

18:14.176 --> 18:16.637
N-E-W-S-P-A-P-E-R.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.972
No fair!

18:18.055 --> 18:20.641
To I-N-V-E-S-T-I-G-A-T-E!

18:20.725 --> 18:22.351
No fair at all!

18:22.435 --> 18:23.477
Shhh!

18:24.729 --> 18:26.105
Go to sleep.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.651
Horse. Horse. Horse!

18:30.735 --> 18:32.737
Plenty of those
in Charlottetown.

18:33.487 --> 18:37.325
- It's a splendidly busy city.
- Yes. It's all rather exciting.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.745
I love Charlottetown. It's fun.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.556
Really, do you have nothing
more interesting than this?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.268
- What else did you have in mind?
- As I said, something interesting.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.229
Something that doesn't bore me
to tears.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.483
This velvet has absolutely no drape.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.403
What do you have in a higher price range?
Something of quality.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.280
This feels like a cat. Meow.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.074
Oh, Minnie May.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.120
I've seen Mother in this mood before.
When she's angry at Father,

19:23.204 --> 19:25.456
she becomes very passionate
about home decor.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.708
How long do you think
her passion will last?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.460
Long enough.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.588
Ahem.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.392
Not the mustard!

19:47.687 --> 19:48.938
Good afternoon, sir.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.066
We were hoping you'd point us
in the direction of your archives.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.568
- Archives?
- Uh...

19:54.652 --> 19:56.529
where you keep the old copies
of the newspapers?

19:56.612 --> 19:59.115
I'm well-apprised
of the concept of an archive.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.828
What's confusing me is your ignorance
of spatial relationships.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.288
Use your young eyes.

20:06.372 --> 20:10.459
Does it look like we have the room
to keep a functioning newspaper archive?

20:11.419 --> 20:13.045
There's no archive.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.465
We have a veritable Sherlock Holmes
on our hands.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.885
Excellent powers of deduction, young lady.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.345
In that case,

20:21.429 --> 20:24.890
do you happen to remember anything
about the story of gold in Cape Wolfe?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.977
Age and memory do not go hand in hand.

20:28.644 --> 20:33.274
But you might have some luck with, um,
Malcolm Frost.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.277
- He covered the story.
- A bona-fide reporter!

20:36.360 --> 20:40.406
A naturalist. He wrote the pieces
because he was concerned, as I recall.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.992
But you best to talk to him.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.453
He frequents the pub down the block.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.371
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you very much.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.748
Girls?

20:49.457 --> 20:52.334
Tread lightly. He never recovered.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.176
Never recovered from what,
do you suppose? The gold?

21:00.259 --> 21:04.305
- Aunt Jo said it was a fiasco.
- Do you suppose his spirit is broken?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.098
This is it.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.433
Here we go.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.615
That's got to be him.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.619
Dear me.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.541
Uh, excuse me, sir.
We're sorry to intrude.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.297
Uh, are you Mr. Malcolm Frost?

21:39.924 --> 21:41.300
I'll take another.

21:43.052 --> 21:47.306
Mr. Frost, you covered a story about gold
for <i>The Island Announcer</i> 10 years ago?

21:50.226 --> 21:51.519
Thirteen.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.272
But I don't talk about my work anymore.
Good day.

21:55.356 --> 21:58.692
- May I ask why not?
- See, that question sets me up to talk,

21:58.776 --> 22:03.489
which not one second ago
I said I would not do.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.826
I'll talk, then.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.245
- Everyone in our town...
- Avonlea.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.330
...has gold fever.
Apparently everyone in Cape Wolfe

22:11.413 --> 22:14.875
had gold fever too,
but there was no gold.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.628
- Incorrect.
- What part is incorrect?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.755
Hopefully the "no gold" part.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.383
A year of my life...
that I'll never get back.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.968
Barkeep?!

22:25.886 --> 22:27.763
I'm scared, Anne. We should go.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.601
Sir, please.
Is there anything you can tell us?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.564
I'm sorry you're sad.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.569
And I'm also sorry
to disturb you from your sadness.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.364
I know how difficult that can be.

22:48.158 --> 22:52.288
But if you can tell us anything at all
about the gold, we'd be much obliged.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.384
Educate yourselves.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.011
Quietly.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.890
Oh, how beautiful.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.143
Your handwriting is so neat.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.104
You have an organized mind, Mr. Frost.
I admire that.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.483
These sketches remind me a bit
of the book Nate gave me.

23:21.567 --> 23:25.613
Uh, Nate's the geologist who found
the gold in the soil of Avonlea.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.240
He showed me the gold
under his microscope,

23:28.324 --> 23:29.825
but I couldn't see anything.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.621
You didn't see any gold?

23:34.163 --> 23:35.664
Once I learn more about the topic,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.083
I'll be better able to perceive
what's right in front of me.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.211
- Gold is very shiny.
- The particles were very small.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.755
Or not there.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.507
You're aggravating...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.636
but you don't seem dumb, or blind.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.598
If there was gold, you would've seen it.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.516
- No, I...
- See, right... right away!

23:54.600 --> 23:56.352
No one listens to reason. I...

23:56.435 --> 23:58.270
That's why I didn't want
to talk about this.

23:58.354 --> 24:02.733
You came here specifically to talk to me
about this specific topic.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.194
Then I tell you something true,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.988
something I know
because of decades of research,

24:08.072 --> 24:10.449
and you say no.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.619
I'll tell you now. Since you insist
on me telling you something,

24:13.702 --> 24:14.620
I'll bet my last dollar

24:14.703 --> 24:17.998
that your town will do exactly
what everyone in Cape Wolfe did.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.877
Yes, there are trace amounts of gold
in the soil of P.E.I.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.381
No, it is not enough to justify
the cost of digging.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.801
Even if you mined for 900 years,
it wouldn't be enough!

24:35.140 --> 24:37.685
Your foolish town will repeat history.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.817
What company is this...

24:45.901 --> 24:48.153
so-called geologist working for?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.240
I don't... know. He never said.

24:51.657 --> 24:56.495
Did he ever talk numbers? Calculate how
much gold a ton of ore would produce?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.581
- No...
- Why not? I'll tell you why.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.167
A ton of ore anywhere on this island

25:02.251 --> 25:05.337
will only reap 40 to 60 cents of profit.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.007
One ton. Forty cents.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.968
That'll buy you two-dozen eggs.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.303
But we don't buy our eggs.
We have chickens.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.642
<i>I can't talk about it!</i>

25:19.309 --> 25:20.602
Shhh.

25:20.686 --> 25:25.023
Diana... why didn't Nate let me
accompany him on his excavations?

25:25.107 --> 25:28.026
Because... there's no gold.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.154
Why was the gold chapter the only
well-loved chapter

25:30.237 --> 25:31.363
in the whole geology book?

25:31.447 --> 25:34.992
Because he studied it
to fabricate a gold discovery.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.453
Why did your father think
my letter to Gilbert

25:37.536 --> 25:40.080
- was the official gold certificate?
- You got me there.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.292
Because I wrote it on paper
I nicked from Nate's room.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.002
The same paper as the certificate!

25:45.085 --> 25:46.587
<i>And he had an embosser.</i>

25:47.671 --> 25:51.300
From New York. He must've forged it.
Why didn't I put any of this together?!

25:51.383 --> 25:53.927
Let me ask you this.
Who have you been listening to recently?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.637
Everyone around here?

25:56.764 --> 25:59.099
Or that person in here? Hmm?

25:59.767 --> 26:01.477
I'm a child, Mr. Frost.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.189
Poppycock. Children are pure instinct.
You should've trusted yourself.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.775
Seems to me
you've got it all figured out.

26:07.858 --> 26:11.945
<i>You wanna come at me? I've been
carrying your dead weight for 5 years!</i>

26:12.029 --> 26:14.239
Nate and Mr. Dunlop
are working together.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.867
- What?! How's that possible?
- I heard them fight one night.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.745
It was the fight of two people
who've known each other for a long time.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.789
There's one huckster,
there's bound to be another.

26:21.872 --> 26:25.125
They're criminals. They used Green Gables
to bamboozle the whole town!

26:25.209 --> 26:26.877
Grifters. Bottom of the barrel.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.879
Have to let your parents know
before it's too late!

26:28.962 --> 26:30.672
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.220
This one has some clean pages left.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.014
Take notes as you explore your life.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.684
It'll help you make sense of it.
Keep honing those instincts.

26:43.769 --> 26:44.895
They're crucial.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.898
Thank you, Mr. Frost. Truly!

27:07.167 --> 27:09.920
Diana? Diana?!

27:10.003 --> 27:11.338
Whoa.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.507
- ...and I won't tell that part...
- Diana!

27:15.050 --> 27:16.552
- Diana!
- Mother! Oh!

27:16.635 --> 27:19.137
We've discovered something awful
about the gold!

27:19.221 --> 27:21.765
What were you doing
in that... establishment?!

27:21.849 --> 27:23.767
- Please, listen to us!
- ...lying about the gold!

27:23.851 --> 27:26.311
Thank you, Officer.
We'll be on our way.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.482
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.901
Mother, I understand
we caused you a fright,

27:32.985 --> 27:34.987
but I promise we had good intentions.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.990
We went there to talk
to Mr. Malcolm Frost about the gold.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.994
What you learned from a strange man
in a public house is of no consequence.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.288
- But, Mother, I...
- I will hear none of it.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.082
You were improper. You disobeyed me.

27:47.165 --> 27:51.420
You fraternized with a stranger,
a male stranger, unchaperoned!

27:51.503 --> 27:54.882
Mr. Frost knows more about the gold
on the island than any of us!

27:54.965 --> 27:57.009
How could you possibly think
that you have the right

27:57.092 --> 27:59.595
to insert yourself
in this complicated financial matter?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.430
You are a child.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.392
You are not to utter one more word
until we are back in Avonlea.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.685
You're making a mistake!

28:06.768 --> 28:09.229
- A mistake?! How dare you?
- Mrs. Barry, please...

28:09.313 --> 28:11.148
If I hear one more word
from either of you,

28:11.231 --> 28:14.109
your friendship will be over for good!
Now come along.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.056
Sure you don't need any help
with supper?

28:44.139 --> 28:45.474
I do not.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.695
Oh, Matthew.
I'm a bit at sixes and sevens.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.156
I've gotten used to being in the kitchen.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.285
I'm in your way.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.081
Ah. Oh. Uh...

29:09.164 --> 29:11.583
Uh, excuse me. Sorry.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.543
Thank you for the dance.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.757
Seems like I'm in everyone's way.

29:32.396 --> 29:35.357
Guess I should... head up,
make myself presentable.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.365
It's time for them to go.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.575
Now.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.745
We'll tell them at supper.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.978
I have some happy news.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.567
I've found a plot of land nearby
that's perfect for my needs.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.319
Land, eh?

30:20.902 --> 30:23.322
Gonna build a gingerbread
house, Mr. Dunlop?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.491
You know, what's lovely is,

30:26.575 --> 30:30.537
the walk from there to Green Gables
is only a half-hour.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.956
Six months from now,
when my house is finished,

30:33.040 --> 30:36.918
I'll remain close to you
in both geography and spirit.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.049
Matthew and I have decided it's time
for you to find other accommodations.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.345
It's time for Green Gables
to get back to normal.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.644
It may, um...

30:55.687 --> 30:58.482
take me a little while
to find someplace else.

30:58.565 --> 31:03.070
We're happy to give you a day or two...
to get organized.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.240
Not to worry, friend.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.869
We're in this together, hmm?

31:20.962 --> 31:24.800
Mr. Dunlop! Shouldn't you be using
this time to pack?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.677
It's Anne! I'm baking her favorite!

31:27.761 --> 31:30.222
I can't wait to hear
all about her adventure!

31:38.730 --> 31:41.650
And I am not against
a child's right to curiosity...

31:41.733 --> 31:44.277
...but Anne continues to coerce my Diana.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.656
Always a pleasure.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.618
Here it is.
It's all there. I promise.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.140
Anne?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.476
Anne?

32:16.560 --> 32:17.936
Anne!

32:19.521 --> 32:21.481
Please thank your hosts!

32:24.151 --> 32:25.360
Thank you.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.702
Marilla, I need to talk to you
about Nate and Mr. Dunl...

32:34.453 --> 32:37.664
We missed you so much.
There's a lot of catching up to do.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.293
I made this for you special.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.463
You must be tired and hungry.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.964
I'm fine.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.678
Mr. Dunlop,
I kindly ask you to leave my kitchen

32:51.761 --> 32:53.805
so I can attend to supper.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.394
Come and help me, Anne.

33:13.617 --> 33:14.910
Malcolm Frost.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.329
He was the naturalist
who reported on the story.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.625
He said there was never any gold
anywhere on Prince Edward Island!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.212
They know.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.134
Nate and Dunlop
have been working together.

33:31.218 --> 33:34.763
They used Green Gables, Marilla.
They used us. They're grifters!

33:34.846 --> 33:37.891
I believe you, Anne. I believe you.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.560
We believe you too, Anne.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.981
Oh... no.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.958
You worked hard today, Jerry.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.586
So just go home to your family.
Be well.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.255
Thank you,
Mr. Cuthbert.

34:11.675 --> 34:15.094
Uh, so... so's you know, the boarders,

34:15.178 --> 34:17.054
they'll be moving on.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.787
Hey!

35:48.104 --> 35:50.357
- They took the gun.
- Where's Anne?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.152
I looked upstairs. They've gone!

35:55.195 --> 35:56.655
I'll go for help.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.523
Ah!

36:39.447 --> 36:40.990
Where do you think you're going,
froggy?

36:49.791 --> 36:50.834
It was you.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.923
It was you!

37:08.685 --> 37:09.728
Let's go.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.276
I never liked you.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.451
Gimme the money!

37:25.618 --> 37:26.578
Sure thing.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.290
- You get your half...
- All of it.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.002
Jonesey.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.547
- Let's...
- This is all your fault!

37:38.548 --> 37:41.009
H-how is this my fault?
The kid tipped the grift.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.886
You turned them against me.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.346
All I wanted was to stay!

37:46.347 --> 37:47.891
Snap out of it.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.518
This isn't on me.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.771
They knew we were working together.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.899
Down yonder!

37:56.232 --> 37:57.192
Come on, boy!

37:59.486 --> 38:00.904
Come on!

38:07.118 --> 38:08.161
Let's go, boys.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.579
This way!

38:09.662 --> 38:11.498
Hyah!

38:12.081 --> 38:13.750
There's no life there for you.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.293
They liked me.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.296
Everyone... they liked me!

38:18.797 --> 38:20.215
Jonesey, we gotta get going.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.842
Hey. We'll find a whole new grift.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.888
Just you and me, just like old times.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.890
There is no me and you!

38:28.973 --> 38:32.060
I'm taking the money,
I'm gonna buy a house with land!

38:32.143 --> 38:34.687
Somewhere beautiful!

38:37.982 --> 38:40.777
Ah! Ah!! No!

38:47.534 --> 38:50.453
There you go, buddy.
I made your wish come true.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.331
Stay in Avonlea forever.

39:00.922 --> 39:03.550
Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

39:03.633 --> 39:06.302
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.308
Come on. Come on.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.396
Over here!

39:17.856 --> 39:19.399
What is it? What've we got?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.610
Careful now.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.654
There's someone on the ground.

39:24.737 --> 39:25.738
Whoa!

39:26.781 --> 39:28.783
Jerry? Jerry!

39:30.785 --> 39:33.329
Jerry!

39:33.413 --> 39:35.039
- I'm down here!
- Jerry.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.834
- We got someone in the hole!
- Help me out of here!

39:37.917 --> 39:40.211
- Are you all right?
- Who have we got?

39:43.590 --> 39:46.217
Got yourself a nice goose egg there.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.137
At least this time I tried to stop them.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.931
- You're a good lad.
- Get him outta there!

39:52.015 --> 39:53.433
Jerry.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.394
Well done.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.064
They're the ones who robbed me
in Charlottetown.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.025
Then you had a feeling.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.658
- It was Nate. He orchestrated everything.
- Quiet now.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.828
No. I was a victim, too!
Are you forgetting?

40:13.912 --> 40:16.873
I pitched in $150 like everyone else!

40:16.956 --> 40:18.750
Avonlea was to be my home!

40:18.833 --> 40:22.295
That's enough now, Mr. Dunlop,
or whoever you are.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.465
- And what of the money?
- It's gone.

40:27.508 --> 40:31.763
He took it! Nate took it.
I'm telling you, I'm a victim, too!

40:31.846 --> 40:34.390
- All of it?
- I'm sorry, William.

40:34.474 --> 40:37.226
Things'll be a little tight for all of us
for a while.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.355
Time to get you home, Jerry.
Up. Yeah.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.486
Matthew said you tried to stop them.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.906
All this time, I...
I couldn't remember who they were.

41:32.699 --> 41:36.160
And then, all of a sudden, like, I-I did.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.246
It was very brave of you.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.021
I wish you'd be rid of that book.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.024
This is a period best forgotten.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.944
I'm not sure I agree with you, Marilla.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.366
Take this rock as an example.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.954
Nate's book taught me
that it's iron pyrite.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.414
Fool's gold.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.085
If you perceive it in a certain light,
it looks like real gold.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.671
It does if you're foolish enough

42:28.755 --> 42:31.674
to trick yourself into seeing something
that isn't real.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.260
All we can do is our best, Marilla,

42:34.719 --> 42:37.638
regardless of what we know or don't know.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.557
True enough.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.269
I believe there's always a bit of good
in any situation,

42:43.352 --> 42:44.896
even a bad one.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.106
I think it builds character.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.400
Easier said than done.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.780
But I suppose that's a fine way
of looking at things.

42:57.408 --> 43:01.662
Malcolm Frost recommends
I trust my intuition, and I plan to.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.352
Hmm.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.438
Fancy.

43:28.356 --> 43:29.732
So what it say?

43:35.863 --> 43:37.865
There's gold in Avonlea?
