00:01.456 --> 00:04.725
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:07.729 --> 00:09.096
I found your biological father.

00:09.098 --> 00:10.130
- I did not ask you to do this.

00:10.132 --> 00:12.800
I made contact with my
biological dad,

00:12.802 --> 00:15.769
and I'd really like for you to
be there with me

00:17.305 --> 00:18.605
- even though spring break
was gonna be

00:18.607 --> 00:21.008
me stuck in a house in Mexico
with Ally and Sadie,

00:21.010 --> 00:21.875
I was still excited,

00:21.877 --> 00:23.477
because Matty was coming
after all.

00:23.479 --> 00:25.679
The future held lots
of possibilities,

00:25.681 --> 00:27.948
including dying
on the side of the road

00:27.950 --> 00:28.949
with my mother in Mexico.

00:28.951 --> 00:31.552
- Jeez, I wasn't even
going that fast.

00:31.554 --> 00:32.886
- Mom, Mexican police
are corrupt.

00:32.888 --> 00:34.521
People get snatched
off the roads all the time

00:34.523 --> 00:37.424
only to be thrown in jail and
never to be heard from again.

00:37.426 --> 00:41.028
- Not if they know
how to work it.

00:41.030 --> 00:43.530
<i>Hola, señor.</i>

00:43.532 --> 00:44.865
I am so, so sorry.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.835
Was I doing something naughty?

00:47.837 --> 00:50.604
I'm just so excited
because my sister and I

00:50.606 --> 00:54.842
are headed down to Rosarito
for spring break.

00:54.844 --> 00:57.377
- While my "sister"
engaged the police,

00:57.379 --> 00:58.745
I engaged in a little masochism,

00:58.747 --> 01:01.415
A.K.A. Checking my inbox
for admission emails.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.684
Wycoff was the last college
I had applied to,

01:03.686 --> 01:06.820
and the only one
that hadn't rejected me, so far.

01:06.822 --> 01:08.889
- I.D., please.
Passport.

01:08.891 --> 01:11.425
- Oh, come on,
what was I doing?

01:11.427 --> 01:14.862
- Has your sister been drinking?

01:14.864 --> 01:15.596
- Sadly, no.

01:15.598 --> 01:18.532
- The officer is not here
to ruin our vacation.

01:18.534 --> 01:21.735
He is here to help us, right?

01:21.737 --> 01:24.838
- <i>Señora,</i> maybe I can
let you off with a warning.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.342
But you need to make sure
that you are much more--

01:28.344 --> 01:29.409
[women screaming]

01:29.411 --> 01:31.078
[Officer shouting in spanish]

01:31.080 --> 01:31.745
- [Screams]

01:31.747 --> 01:33.547
- Oh, it's okay, officer!

01:33.549 --> 01:35.616
My sister just got into college!

01:35.618 --> 01:36.984
- [Screams]

01:36.986 --> 01:38.952
- Ah!

01:44.826 --> 01:45.792
I'm so excited.

01:45.794 --> 01:50.597
- I thought the beach house
was supposed to be on a... beach.

01:50.599 --> 01:53.500
- Ah, I think smell the ocean.

01:53.502 --> 01:56.904
Or maybe that's just
the alcohol.

01:56.906 --> 01:58.038
- Finally.

01:58.040 --> 01:58.872
Jesus.

01:58.874 --> 02:00.707
Ugh, you brought little bitch?

02:00.709 --> 02:02.776
- She got into college.

02:02.778 --> 02:04.378
Wycoff college.

02:04.380 --> 02:05.612
We are celebrating!

02:05.614 --> 02:07.648
- J, you got into college?

02:07.650 --> 02:08.382
- Yes!

02:08.384 --> 02:10.717
- Oh, I am so happy...

02:10.719 --> 02:11.485
And relieved.

02:11.487 --> 02:12.519
Not that I was losing sleep

02:12.521 --> 02:15.856
or having bouts
of trichotillomania or anything.

02:15.858 --> 02:18.692
So we're on spring break,
peoples!

02:18.694 --> 02:22.629
Let's max this
mother-fondler out.

02:22.631 --> 02:23.630
Yeah.

02:23.632 --> 02:25.098
- <i>Entrada.</i>

02:25.100 --> 02:26.366
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:26.368 --> 02:31.004
Here she is, my college girl.
- Awesome.

02:31.006 --> 02:32.906
- Infinite O.M.G.
Where?

02:32.908 --> 02:34.474
- Wycoff.
I can finally relax

02:34.476 --> 02:35.709
and enjoy the rest of
my senior year.

02:35.711 --> 02:39.413
- Yeah, better soak up some rays
and bask in your complacency

02:39.415 --> 02:42.649
to prepare for a life
of desperate mediocrity.

02:42.651 --> 02:44.651
- Sadita, chill, lady.

02:44.653 --> 02:45.452
- Mmm, ah.

02:45.454 --> 02:47.754
- Oh, I'm so tired
from the drive.

02:47.756 --> 02:50.457
We almost got murdered,
by the way.

02:50.459 --> 02:51.825
I'll tell you
all about it later.

02:51.827 --> 02:54.795
Right now, I just--
I need a nap.

02:54.797 --> 02:56.830
- What?

02:56.832 --> 02:58.565
Pussy.

03:00.501 --> 03:01.635
- Jenna.

03:01.637 --> 03:03.837
- You know I'm sorry, right?

03:03.839 --> 03:05.505
It was lame of me to put
all that stuff

03:05.507 --> 03:07.541
that went down with Gabby
on you.

03:07.543 --> 03:08.742
- Well, yeah.

03:08.744 --> 03:10.143
I'm sorry she's not coming,
though.

03:10.145 --> 03:11.878
- You know, I have been
thinking a lot

03:11.880 --> 03:13.513
about how you went
out of your way

03:13.515 --> 03:16.950
to help get in touch
with my biological dad.

03:16.952 --> 03:17.818
- I was glad to.

03:17.820 --> 03:18.785
- I wanted to do it,

03:18.787 --> 03:20.554
but I guess I needed a push.

03:20.556 --> 03:25.025
I mean, as usual,
you totally get me.

03:25.027 --> 03:26.893
- Well, we get each other.

03:26.895 --> 03:28.462
- Yeah.

03:28.464 --> 03:29.863
- So are you going to see him?

03:29.865 --> 03:30.630
- I think so.

03:30.632 --> 03:31.898
I'm just waiting
to hear back from him.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.967
I'm a little freaked.

03:33.969 --> 03:39.606
But, hey, this is our last
spring break together, right?

03:39.608 --> 03:41.575
So let's really max it out,
okay?

03:41.577 --> 03:45.078
- I wasn't sure if "together"
meant <i>together</i> together

03:45.080 --> 03:46.079
or just together.

03:46.081 --> 03:47.147
But whatever "together" meant,

03:47.149 --> 03:50.684
I was so glad to be together
with Matty again.

03:50.686 --> 03:53.720
- Man, you are ti-ight, Sadita.

03:53.722 --> 03:54.755
- I can't stand seeing

03:54.757 --> 03:56.990
that tragic little
STD dispenser

03:56.992 --> 03:57.958
act like a pig in [Bleep]

03:57.960 --> 03:59.526
Just because she got
into some lame college

03:59.528 --> 04:02.896
when I still haven't heard
from my stank-ass scholarship.

04:02.898 --> 04:04.131
- Don't worry about that now.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.098
- You would be worried too

04:05.100 --> 04:06.733
if your future
were hanging in the balance.

04:06.735 --> 04:08.535
- Babe, I worry about my future
all the time.

04:08.537 --> 04:11.038
I just don't make the whole
world suffer for it, okay?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.539
- You're living your future.

04:12.541 --> 04:13.540
You go to community college.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.243
You'll probably be a cop
like your dad.

04:16.245 --> 04:17.711
- Hey, I never said that.

04:17.713 --> 04:20.080
I'm open to other stuff,
and you should be too.

04:20.082 --> 04:21.581
Everything isn't
so black-and-white.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.617
All I'm saying is,
no matter what happens,

04:23.619 --> 04:27.988
a smart, beautiful girl like you
will do just fine.

04:27.990 --> 04:28.822
- Maybe.

04:28.824 --> 04:32.759
So do you think I'm more smart
or more beautiful?

04:33.094 --> 04:36.163
- Parasailing, zip-lining,
deep sea fishing.

04:36.165 --> 04:37.230
Biggie's done all of this.

04:37.232 --> 04:40.600
What I really want to do
is swim with the dolphins.

04:40.602 --> 04:42.602
They are so cute
and so smart,

04:42.604 --> 04:44.638
and that's exactly
how I like my fish.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.541
Well, that or beer-battered
in a taco

04:47.543 --> 04:49.142
with an ice-cold egg nog.

04:49.144 --> 04:50.977
- Dolphin's aren't fish, Val.

04:50.979 --> 04:51.812
They're mammals.

04:51.814 --> 04:53.814
- Mammals that breathe water?

04:53.816 --> 04:56.817
I guess my cats are fish too,
huh, Jake?

04:56.819 --> 04:59.219
I hope that wasn't
on the S.A.T.s

04:59.221 --> 05:00.220
- Whoa, where are you all going?

05:00.222 --> 05:01.721
- We're going to the beach.
- Why?

05:01.723 --> 05:03.690
You got alcohol, sun,
pool right here.

05:03.692 --> 05:07.794
God, I hate children
who don't know how to party.

05:07.796 --> 05:09.596

05:09.598 --> 05:11.665
[Knocking]

05:15.903 --> 05:18.238
- What are you peg boys
doing here?

05:18.240 --> 05:20.073
- Social anthropology.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.274
Studying the bitch out of water.

05:21.276 --> 05:23.110
- And getting
this party started!

05:23.112 --> 05:25.312
Whoo!
- Sorry, you weren't invited.

05:25.314 --> 05:27.247
But there's plenty of room
on the beach

05:27.249 --> 05:29.149
with the murderers and vagrants.

05:29.151 --> 05:31.818
You're welcome.

05:31.820 --> 05:32.319
- Hold up.

05:32.321 --> 05:35.889
- We brought the best
party favor ever.

05:41.195 --> 05:42.229
- Lissa?

05:42.231 --> 05:43.897
- Lissa, are you okay?

05:43.899 --> 05:45.132
- No, I was in prison.

05:45.134 --> 05:48.235
Mommy kept me in the house
ever since I was suspended.

05:48.237 --> 05:50.570
And I was atoning,
like, 24/7

05:50.572 --> 05:52.072
in my room with the good book,
and then--

05:52.074 --> 05:54.074
- and then we broke her
out of that hell-hole

05:54.076 --> 05:56.176
and brought her
to you kind people.

05:56.178 --> 05:57.844
- Jesus, that is desperate.

05:57.846 --> 05:59.146
- I don't care
about Jesus anymore

05:59.148 --> 06:00.747
if he doesn't want me
to be with Tyler.

06:00.749 --> 06:02.682
Mommy can't make me,
mommy can't make me!

06:02.684 --> 06:06.219
- Now, you kids are
the kind of children I like.

06:06.221 --> 06:07.687
Oh.

06:11.526 --> 06:15.061

some new leaf.

Yo, boys, just got a text

06:25.107 --> 06:26.072
He's on his way.

06:26.074 --> 06:27.040
He's meeting me here,

06:27.042 --> 06:29.709
and we're gonna screw
our brains out.

06:29.711 --> 06:31.678
Would that be okay with you?

06:31.680 --> 06:32.546
- Just put a towel down.

06:32.548 --> 06:35.916
I want my deposit back
on the rental.

06:35.918 --> 06:37.484
- Hey, Jenna.

06:37.486 --> 06:38.752
Jenna, hey.

06:38.754 --> 06:40.187
I just heard back
from my bio dad,

06:40.189 --> 06:42.155
and we're gonna
meet up tomorrow.

06:42.157 --> 06:44.558
I was wondering, maybe--

06:44.560 --> 06:45.592
maybe you want to come with me?

06:45.594 --> 06:48.228
- Yes, of course.
I'd love to.

06:48.230 --> 06:52.799
- It'd be really, really nice
to have you there.

06:52.801 --> 06:55.502

06:55.504 --> 06:58.638
I'm sure you'll be glad
you did it.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.072

are you gonna wait?

07:06.949 --> 07:07.847

08:50.952 --> 08:52.719
in this mess of a country.

08:52.721 --> 08:55.755
- Oh, Jenna,
you're aren't coming to T.J.?

08:55.757 --> 08:57.057
- Uh, Tijuana?

08:57.059 --> 08:58.925
No thanks, we're gonna stay in.

08:58.927 --> 09:00.794
- Yeah, and kick it old-school.

09:00.796 --> 09:02.062
- I didn't want to go out,

09:02.064 --> 09:03.396
because I was perfectly content

09:03.398 --> 09:05.065
looking forward
to my future in college

09:05.067 --> 09:08.635
and to my big day
with Matty tomorrow.

09:09.904 --> 09:11.671
- I'll go get my truck.

09:11.673 --> 09:12.372
- Meet you out front.

09:12.374 --> 09:17.310
I felt content and hopeful
and warm.

09:24.752 --> 09:25.185
- Hey.

09:25.187 --> 09:26.986
- I should have known
that that warm, content,

09:26.988 --> 09:28.788
and hopeful feeling
wouldn't last,

09:28.790 --> 09:32.792
because once again I was going
to be left out in the cold.

09:32.794 --> 09:35.795
- [Mouthing]

09:42.303 --> 09:43.536
- Nothing.

09:43.538 --> 09:44.671
- Please talk to me.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.606
Can't we just have a truce?

09:46.608 --> 09:48.708
You got into a great college.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.210
Life is good again.

09:50.212 --> 09:53.012
- Matty and I were supposed
to drive up to San Diego

09:53.014 --> 09:54.547
to meet his bio dad,

09:54.549 --> 09:56.116
but then Gabby showed up.

09:56.118 --> 10:01.221
- Sweetheart, don't spend the
rest of your time in high school

10:01.223 --> 10:02.055
hung up on Matty.

10:02.057 --> 10:05.625
You need to focus on yourself
and your own needs.

10:05.627 --> 10:07.861
That's how I cope
with your father.

10:07.863 --> 10:09.696
Okay, it's not exactly
the same thing,

10:09.698 --> 10:12.165
but you know what I mean,
right?

10:12.167 --> 10:13.666
- Yeah.

10:13.668 --> 10:14.267
Sadly, I do.

10:14.269 --> 10:17.871
- And don't live
in your head so much.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.038
I can see it,

10:19.040 --> 10:20.974
your wheels always turning.

10:20.976 --> 10:27.213
Just relax and live
in the moment, okay?

10:30.117 --> 10:32.619
- Well, look who it is.

10:32.621 --> 10:34.120
- Hair of the dog, anyone?

10:34.122 --> 10:36.122
- Ooh, another exotic...

10:36.124 --> 10:36.890
Mexican dish?

10:36.892 --> 10:38.825
- You know, some people think
that more alcohol

10:38.827 --> 10:41.327
is actually the best cure
for a hangover.

10:41.329 --> 10:43.062
- You're amateur hour, Val!

10:43.064 --> 10:45.298
- Keep the buzz a-buzzin',
Ms. Marks!

10:45.300 --> 10:46.666
- Buzz-buzz!

10:46.668 --> 10:49.302
- We saw what you call
a donkey show.

10:49.304 --> 10:50.870
Not your typical circus act.

10:50.872 --> 10:53.339
There were no clowns
or children.

10:53.341 --> 10:54.340
I think there were peanuts.

10:54.342 --> 10:57.911
- It was the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen

10:57.913 --> 10:59.212
that I was not a participant in.

10:59.214 --> 11:01.815
- Oh, please, that donkey show
was nothing.

11:01.817 --> 11:04.617
The world is full
of sick and disgusting stuff,

11:04.619 --> 11:05.752
so just get over it.

11:05.754 --> 11:08.087
Live it up, lap it up, bitches!

[Giggles]

11:09.691 --> 11:10.857
Let's go to bed.

11:10.859 --> 11:13.326
I'm hungry.

11:14.061 --> 11:16.296
- I could lay here
in bed all day.

11:16.298 --> 11:18.731
- We don't need
to be anywhere else.

11:19.868 --> 11:24.304
Man, Sadita, you almost
just broke my face.

11:24.306 --> 11:25.104
- I got it.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.273
I won that [Bleep] scholarship.

11:27.275 --> 11:28.708
Good-bye, Palos Hills.

11:28.710 --> 11:29.676
Hello, New York City.

11:29.678 --> 11:33.947
Pretty soon it will all
have just been a bad dream.

11:35.983 --> 11:37.817
- Wow, Ty-Ty.

11:37.819 --> 11:41.721
That's what we've
been waiting to do.

11:41.723 --> 11:43.957
- For so long.

11:43.959 --> 11:46.259
- And now we did it.

11:46.261 --> 11:47.827
Yay.

make a porn?

12:31.839 --> 12:33.773

earth-shattering moments

12:33.775 --> 12:36.409
when I thought my mom
was actually right.

12:36.411 --> 12:39.345
I just needed to breathe,
smell the ocean,

12:39.347 --> 12:41.714
and enjoy the view.

It...

12:57.499 --> 13:00.333
Could be the perfect day.

13:09.276 --> 13:11.945

You an athlete, or what?

13:49.417 --> 13:51.417
I was pretty serious
about football.

13:51.419 --> 13:52.418
Yeah, I was a good receiver,

13:52.420 --> 13:57.123
but I was more into surfing
and smoking out.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.458

13:58.460 --> 14:00.393

Nice, man.

I had gone myself,

it would have helped

talk to a dude

14:19.414 --> 14:20.847
who tried to pick me up
on the beach,

14:20.849 --> 14:24.350
but seeing Matty go off
with Gabby was a wake-up call.

14:24.352 --> 14:25.485
So you're a marine.

14:25.487 --> 14:26.986
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

14:26.988 --> 14:28.321
I'm over at camp Pendleton
right now,

14:28.323 --> 14:31.157
but I ship out for my first
tour of duty in a few days.

14:31.159 --> 14:34.093
- So you've always wanted
to be in the marines?

14:34.095 --> 14:35.128
- Yeah, I have.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.764
And I also wanted
to study marine biology,

14:37.766 --> 14:39.799
and I know the service will
pay for it once I get out,

14:39.801 --> 14:42.969
so I really hope I can get
into Scripps in San Diego.

14:42.971 --> 14:45.471
It's the best program

what he wanted out of his life

14:51.746 --> 14:52.745
and how he was gonna get it.

14:52.747 --> 14:56.182
Talking to him made
all my worries about college,

14:56.184 --> 14:57.450
my mom, Matty,

14:57.452 --> 14:59.052
seem so trivial.

my buddies in town.

15:01.122 --> 15:05.091

15:35.256 --> 15:38.524
Actually, perhaps
I over-estimated my skill set.

of these comments

15:46.501 --> 15:48.568

for wedding rings

16:15.463 --> 16:16.462

you so relentlessly endearing.

your vortex of need and greed.

okay?

16:40.855 --> 16:41.854
Some of us like it here.

We're glad you could make it

16:51.633 --> 16:52.632
I'm really glad too.

16:55.136 --> 16:56.302

16:56.304 --> 17:00.640
We went and saw
my biological father.

17:00.642 --> 17:02.508
- Wow, intense.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.244
You were keeping this a secret?

17:05.246 --> 17:05.645
- Yeah.

17:05.647 --> 17:06.646
- It had been our secret.

17:06.648 --> 17:10.283
- O.M.G., all the familial
factoids, stat.

17:10.285 --> 17:11.083
Did you bond?

17:11.085 --> 17:12.985
Did you hug and laugh and cry?

17:12.987 --> 17:14.487
Was it an emotional mash-up?

17:14.489 --> 17:15.288
Did you video?

17:15.290 --> 17:17.456
- He was a very cool guy,

17:17.458 --> 17:19.625
and he had Matty's smile.

17:19.627 --> 17:20.526
It was just uncanny.

17:20.528 --> 17:23.529
I was so glad
Matty wanted me to come.

17:23.531 --> 17:25.965
- Yeah, still processing.

It was cool.

He's cool.

17:27.502 --> 17:30.436
Looks pretty good for his age,
you know?

17:30.438 --> 17:32.038
- You gonna see him again?

17:32.040 --> 17:33.472
- Probably, yeah.

17:33.474 --> 17:34.607
It was...

17:34.609 --> 17:35.675
Exhausting, actually.

17:35.677 --> 17:39.278
Lot of emotional stuff
coming up.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.179
I'm really wiped,

17:40.181 --> 17:41.647
so I'm just gonna hit the sack.

17:41.649 --> 17:45.251
I'm sorry, just hang out
with everyone, okay?

17:45.253 --> 17:46.419
- Okay.
- Bye.

17:46.421 --> 17:47.687
- I could tell he wanted
to talk to me

17:47.689 --> 17:50.590
but, given the circumstances,
couldn't.

17:50.592 --> 17:52.391
I couldn't help
feeling a little sad,

17:52.393 --> 17:54.527
but I was also thinking
about Brian,

17:54.529 --> 17:57.263
about how big the world
outside of high school

17:57.265 --> 17:58.931
and Palos Hills was,

17:58.933 --> 18:02.935
and how small
this would all soon seem.

18:04.104 --> 18:05.438
- So...

18:05.440 --> 18:08.708
Should we [Bleep] like animals?

18:08.710 --> 18:09.942
- We could.

18:09.944 --> 18:11.010
- If we [Bleep] like animals,

18:11.012 --> 18:12.044
let's do it like bunnies.

18:12.046 --> 18:13.713
They're so cute and Fluffy.

18:13.715 --> 18:15.248
Or we could go get churros.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.149
They're good in Mexico.

18:17.151 --> 18:21.187
We can...Do anything we want.

18:21.189 --> 18:23.623
- Indeed we can.

18:25.425 --> 18:26.959
- It's not as fun like this,
is it?

18:26.961 --> 18:30.096
- Well, the prohibition
added an element of danger.

18:30.098 --> 18:32.665
- I know, and now
it's so boring.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.300
That's not what I meant.

18:34.302 --> 18:36.269
- It's okay, Lissa.

18:36.271 --> 18:38.371
- Should we quit
while we're ahead?

18:38.373 --> 18:39.138
- I think so.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.473
I'm sure our paths
will cross again,

18:40.475 --> 18:44.410
but for now let's part
with a kiss.

18:46.713 --> 18:48.581
- Do you ever listen
to yourself, Sadie?

18:48.583 --> 18:50.049
- Um, all the time, Sergio.

18:50.051 --> 18:51.050
I have a really loud voice.

18:51.052 --> 18:53.119
- Well, you might want to cut
other people a break sometime.

18:53.121 --> 18:55.354
- Don't make me seem
like a heartless bitch

18:55.356 --> 18:56.689
just because I have
higher aspirations

18:56.691 --> 18:58.991
than going to a J.C.
And working on a food truck.

18:58.993 --> 19:02.094
- That's not why you seem
like a heartless bitch, Sadie.

19:02.096 --> 19:04.730
And I think you're smart enough,
miss Columbia U.,

19:04.732 --> 19:07.466
to figure that out.

19:07.468 --> 19:08.467
- Don't go.

19:08.469 --> 19:10.403
And don't call me
miss Columbia U.

19:10.405 --> 19:13.005
It makes me sound
like a pageant whore.

19:13.007 --> 19:17.176
Look, Sergio, I'm sorry.

19:17.178 --> 19:18.577
- Yeah?
Okay.

19:18.579 --> 19:20.346
Why not try a little harder
to be nice

19:20.348 --> 19:22.214
while you got me around, okay?

19:22.216 --> 19:24.650
- Okay, I will.

19:24.652 --> 19:27.053
Jesus, you're a lot of work.

19:27.055 --> 19:28.721
- [Scoffs]

19:31.658 --> 19:34.493
- Whatever and whoever
had come between Matty and I,

19:34.495 --> 19:36.762
I could tell he really needed
to talk to someone

19:36.764 --> 19:40.533
who understood
about his crazy day.

19:44.371 --> 19:46.038
[Knocking]

19:46.040 --> 19:46.772
- Hey.

19:46.774 --> 19:48.107
What are you doing here?

19:48.109 --> 19:49.342
- I'm just checking in on you,

19:49.344 --> 19:53.312
seeing how you're doing
after meeting your bio dad.

19:53.314 --> 19:55.081
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.082
- That's it?

19:56.084 --> 19:58.751
I mean, did you feel
like you guys clicked, or--

19:58.753 --> 20:01.487
- Jen, I'm sorry,
but Gabby's right down the hall.

20:01.489 --> 20:07.193
If she finds us
and we're both, you know...

20:07.195 --> 20:12.798
Can't just always keeping
falling into old habits, right?

20:14.201 --> 20:14.667
Okay.

20:14.669 --> 20:15.634
- All right.
- Oh.

20:15.636 --> 20:18.404
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:19.272 --> 20:21.307
I had helped Matty
find his bio dad

20:21.309 --> 20:23.242
and wanted to share
his journey with him,

20:23.244 --> 20:24.810
but if he didn't want
to share with me,

20:24.812 --> 20:27.079
well, I was surprisingly
okay with it.

20:27.081 --> 20:30.149
If it was so easy for him to
close the door right in my face,

20:30.151 --> 20:33.519
well, I could close the door
on him too.

20:38.225 --> 20:39.658
- I've only known you for a
couple days,

20:39.660 --> 20:42.028
but I see a strong girl
in front of me,

20:42.030 --> 20:43.396
with a big life ahead of her.

20:43.398 --> 20:44.630
- Well, hello, T.

20:44.632 --> 20:45.264
- Hi.

20:45.266 --> 20:46.465
Adam is, like, amaze-arama.

20:46.467 --> 20:49.001
It's like I look at him
and I forget to talk.

20:49.003 --> 20:51.370
- Have you seen Jenna?
- Stop, Matty.

20:51.372 --> 20:54.540
- Excuse me?
- You had your chance.
