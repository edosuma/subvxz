00:56.800 --> 00:57.400
Ooh!

00:57.400 --> 00:59.300
JOE:
Crisis averted.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.300
All eyes under the age
of nine are closed.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.900
And, miracle of miracles,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.600
the children they
belong to are asleep.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.300
What about Ariel?

01:09.600 --> 01:12.000
What about Ariel?
Let's leave Ariel alone.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.300
She's 14. She's in her room
simultaneously doing homework,

01:15.300 --> 01:17.400
listening to music,
texting her friends

01:17.400 --> 01:20.400
and counting the hours
until she's 18.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.900
Let's not unnecessarily
tax her concentration.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.700
How long was I asleep?

01:26.100 --> 01:28.200
I was only gone ten minutes.
You fell asleep?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.100
I had a dream. This girl,

01:30.100 --> 01:32.400
she was in a car.
She hit a deer.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.200
She was trapped inside.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.600
Is there anyone to notify?

01:37.500 --> 01:39.500
Did you catch
the plate number?

01:40.500 --> 01:41.000
You have any idea

01:41.000 --> 01:42.900
where the accident
might have taken place?

01:42.900 --> 01:44.300
No. Nothing.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.500
I didn't even
see the girl's face.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.400
Okay. Well,
I guess there's not much

01:48.400 --> 01:50.200
to do about it right now, then.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
(groaning)
A little help.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.000
Anyway, you were
telling me about this woman.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.000
From Ameritips.
Cynthia Keener.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.100
Why is she paying you?
Why isn't the company that
she works for paying you?

02:02.100 --> 02:03.600
Because I don't work
for that company.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.800
She doesn't want
the company knowing
anything about me.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.600
 <i>You know, in a lot of ways,</i>
 <i>it's kind of like what I used</i>

02:09.600 --> 02:10.800
to do for Devalos.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.900
That was secret.
This is secret.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.200
But why?

02:16.900 --> 02:18.700
I think the job
is all she has.

02:18.700 --> 02:22.100
I think she wants to impress
the people that she works for.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.300
I guess she's hoping
I'll be able

02:23.300 --> 02:25.500
to help her
with some of her cases.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.200
Give her a leg up.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.800
She'll get the glory,
I'll get the 800 bucks a week.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.000
omm.m!

03:53.100 --> 03:55.000
Allison, look.
Whatever you saw...

03:55.000 --> 03:55.900
Our daughter, Joe.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.900
The danger is not imminent,
if it's even real.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.200
What does that mean?

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
Come on. The reality is,
Ariel does not dri.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.100
Yet!

04:05.100 --> 04:06.300
Exactly.

04:06.700 --> 04:07.600
Whatever you saw,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.300
it has nothing to do
with the here and now.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.300
I mean, you know as well as I do

04:12.400 --> 04:14.100
she's a good
two-and-a-half years away

04:14.100 --> 04:15.600
from getting behind the wheel
of a car.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.700
So?

04:16.700 --> 04:18.200
So there's still time

04:18.700 --> 04:20.899
to make sure
that it doesn't happen.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.400
In fact, we can guarantee it.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.800
What do you mean, guarantee it?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.800
What kind of car
did she have
the accident in?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.400
I have no idea.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.900
Okay. Well, hopefully,
sometime in the next

04:30.900 --> 04:32.900
two-and-a-half years,
you'll have this dream again.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.200
And maybe then
you'll make it a point

04:34.200 --> 04:36.300
to notice what make
and model the car is.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.000
Then we'll make it a point
never to buy

04:38.000 --> 04:39.100
that make
or model car.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.700
Well, maybe it's not our car.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.300
Maybe she borrows it
from a friend or a boyfriend.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.400
Okay, fine. Fine. Look. When and
if you know what kind

04:46.400 --> 04:48.200
of car it is, then
we'll both just go

04:48.200 --> 04:50.100
to Ariel and
we'll tell her.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.700
And she'll make it her business
never to get in one,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.100
much less drive one.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.200
See? It's a lock.
It's a guarantee.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.500
Come on. Let's
get some rest.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.000
CYNTHIA KEENER:
She's 16 years old.
Her name's Melanie Daniels.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.200
Apparently, she's
a very good kid.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.400
No history of
trouble or drugs.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.300
She's a junior at
Hilldale High School
across town.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.000
She's been missing
since yesterday morning.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.100
She caught the bus
to go to school

05:24.100 --> 05:26.000
but never showed
up at school.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.700
This happened yesterday?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.400
Why? Is something
the matter?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.700
I guess I'm just surprised

05:33.700 --> 05:36.000
that her parents called you
before the police.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.100
Oh, no, no.
They-They didn't call me.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.300
I called them.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.100
I went over to their home,
actually.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.900
Just as soon as the missing
child report came through

05:45.900 --> 05:48.000
on my e-mail, 
I drove over and talked

05:48.000 --> 05:50.600
to the mother, and explained
that while

05:51.200 --> 05:53.700
there were several hundred cases
the police were tracking,

05:53.700 --> 05:55.800
for me, this would
be the only one.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.800
That's quite a look
on your face, Mrs. Dubois.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.900
I'm not an ambulance chaser,

06:06.300 --> 06:07.900
but this <i>is</i> how I make my money,

06:07.900 --> 06:11.100
and I need to strike
while the iron's hot.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.600
Okay.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.000
Um... forgive me.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm not certain
how this works.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.100
But I've read online
that people like you,

06:25.400 --> 06:26.700
when they
touch something

06:26.800 --> 06:30.100
that belongs to
a missing person or,

06:30.400 --> 06:31.900
for instance,
a dead person,

06:32.300 --> 06:35.800
um, sometimes you...
you might get vibes

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
or signals.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.800
Yes? No?

06:43.700 --> 06:45.400
Sometimes. It depends.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.500
Here's the entire contents
of Melanie's locker.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.900
Her mother gave me
permission to borrow it.

06:53.900 --> 06:54.700
I was wondering

06:54.700 --> 06:58.300
if you could do, uh...
whatever it is that you do,

06:58.300 --> 07:00.500
and give me a call.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.600
Hey, Ariel.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.400
Are the Suns going to
make the playoffs this year?

07:09.500 --> 07:10.400
I don't know.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.800
I don't really follow sports.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.000
Well, maybe you
could ask your mom.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.000
I mean, she knows
the future, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Come on, man.
No, no. no.
Just ask her

07:20.000 --> 07:21.300
if she could check
her crystal ball.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.700
Leave her alone, Jeremy.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.900
Just ask her.

07:28.100 --> 07:28.900
Ariel!

07:28.900 --> 07:30.000
Ariel, wait.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.200
What do you want, Connor?

07:36.400 --> 07:37.500
I don't know.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.800
He's a jerk. And I'm a jerk
for hanging around him.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.900
I'm really sorry.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.200
Okay. I heard you.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.600
So, are you going
to that KHBX thing?

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
What?

07:51.100 --> 07:53.800
KHBX. The radio station.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.400
They have that concert
at the Orpheum every year.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.900
There's, like,
a dozen different groups.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.700
It's on Saturday
during the day.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.900
Did you maybe
want a ticket?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.200
No. That's okay.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.300
I actually don't have the money
for that right now.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.000
No. No. I... I mean,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.600
I would buy it for you.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.100
We'd... we'd
go together.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.900
I'm just warning you.
We're back from school,

08:53.900 --> 08:55.300
and I need your help
with something.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.600
What are you talking about?

08:56.700 --> 08:57.900
Mom? Did Dad tell you?

08:57.900 --> 09:00.700
The most amazing thing happened
to me at school today.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.800
Well, tell me.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.000
This really cute guy-- I think
he's in the 11th grade--

09:04.000 --> 09:06.200
asked me to go to a concert with
him on Saturday

09:06.200 --> 09:07.700
at the Orpheum downtown.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.000
Are parents going
to this concert?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.100
No.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.800
And who is
this boy again?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.100
Connor. He's really nice.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.500
Yeah? But we don't
even know him.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.300
And you want to go downtown
into the city?

09:23.300 --> 09:25.800
It's during the day.
And how are you
going to get there?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.300
I don't know. We haven't
figured that out yet.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.000
Oh, honey, I don't know.
I think that your mommy and I

09:31.000 --> 09:32.200
are going to have
a problem with this.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.200
I'm 14.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.100
And he's 16.

09:34.100 --> 09:34.800
So?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.700
So we don't know him.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.400
He's so nice. Honest.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.400
And you know this how?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.700
Because I know it!
And, besides, it's a concert!

09:42.700 --> 09:45.300
They'll be tons of people.
Nothing is going to happen.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.500
And you know this because
you've been to so many concerts?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.500
You two are crazy!

09:49.700 --> 09:50.900
Crazy? Really?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.700
You know what
I've been doing all day?

09:52.700 --> 09:54.500
I've been trying
to find a missing girl,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.300
a couple of years older
than you.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.500
Gone. Vanished into thin air.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.800
Okay. So? I'm not her!

10:02.500 --> 10:04.400
And how did it happen?
Was she going to a concert?

10:04.400 --> 10:06.200
No. Actually,
she was going to school.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.300
Okay. Fine.
I'll stop going to school.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.600
Hey! You're not gonna get
your way by being a wise guy.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.800
What difference does it make?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.400
I'm not going
to get my way anyways.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Ariel?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Ariel.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.200
You know, no one is saying
you can't ever go to a concert

10:45.200 --> 10:46.800
without an adult.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.800
No one is saying that
you can't ever go out with boys.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.100
Just not this boy.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Just not this Saturday.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.500
Honey, I know
how you feel.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.500
(phone rings in distance)
My mom wouldn't let me go

11:04.500 --> 11:07.000
to a concert alone
until I was 16.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.100
And you know what?

11:08.100 --> 11:09.700
When I finally went,

11:10.600 --> 11:12.300
I realized she was right.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.300
Hey, it's Cynthia Keener.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.100
She wanted to know if
you had anything for her.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.600
She said you'd know
what that meant.
Yeah.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.900
Tell her I'm still
working on it.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.300
Tell her I need to
call her back, please.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.700
Ariel...

12:55.100 --> 12:56.300
Teresa Vennali?

12:56.900 --> 12:57.900
Here.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.200
Regina Watanabe?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.400
Present.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.700
TEACHER:
Steve Zennon?
Yup.

13:09.300 --> 13:12.500
Reaction?
Uh, what do you mean?

13:12.700 --> 13:15.200
Jordan Spence!
Come on, pretty
great, huh?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.900
Well, I don't know. I mean,
what does he look like?

13:17.900 --> 13:19.100
Okay, don't do that.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.100
Don't take a poop all ovover my
good news just to be funny.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.400
I'm sorry.
It's great.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.900
It's better than great.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.900
It happened just
the way I dreamed it.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.800
Right in front
of my locker.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.600
He was even wearing the shirt
I told you he'd be wearing.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.300
I'm really happy for you, Mo...

13:35.400 --> 13:36.600
Ally.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.900
Did you pick up
your yearbook yet?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.000
Did you see
the pictures of us?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.400
There we are.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.700
Al?

14:22.400 --> 14:23.600
You okay?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.100
What's going on?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
It's Ariel.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
It's that damn dream.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.500
She can't reach the phone.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.800
She's trapped in that car,
bleeding to death.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.200
Okay...

14:34.300 --> 14:36.300
No, I didn't see
the kind of car.

14:36.900 --> 14:37.900
I didn't see anything.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.600
Just our daughter suffering.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.000
Wh-Wh-What are
you doing?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.000
Oh! Why do I keep
seeing that dream?

14:46.100 --> 14:47.700
I'm not learning
anything from it.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.000
I'm not seeing anything
that I haven't seen already.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.700
Okay, well,
call me crazy,

14:53.700 --> 14:55.800
but, you know, she's not
speaking to you,you just had a
big fight with your daughter.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.800
so maybe you're bringing that
anxiety back into bed with you.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.800
You know what the irony is?
There is a girl out there

15:02.800 --> 15:05.100
who really needs my help,
who really is in trouble,

15:05.200 --> 15:08.200
and I have nothing for her. I
touch her things, I get nothing.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.500
I touch her hairbrush,
I see her hair.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.600
I touch her contact lens
case, I see her eyes.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.700
I'm not even sure
any of it is real.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.900
I so badly want
to see something.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.100
Did you call
that Keener woman back?
No.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.800
I'm gonna see her tomorrow.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.500
I'm not looking forward to it.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.300
You know, I...
have nothing for her.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.900
CYNTHIA:
 <i>Well, I don't understand.</i>

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
I gave you all those things
that belong to her,

15:31.000 --> 15:32.400
and you come up
with nothing?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.500
It doesn't work that way;
I'm not a Geiger counter.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
You can't just flip a switch
and turn it on.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.200
Sometimes it just...
doesn't happen.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.900
Still, you do
expect to get paid.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.900
I don't work for charity.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.600
Neither do you.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
I mean, how did it work with
the District Attorney?

15:52.300 --> 15:54.900
Surely there must have been
some level of reliability.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.400
He wouldn't have kept you
around all that time
if there weren't.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.800
It was completely different.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.600
He didn't keep me
at home hiding.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.100
I got to go to the crime scenes,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.500
talk to the victims,
to their families.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.400
Well, that would rather seem

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
to defeat the
purpose, wouldn't it?

16:08.700 --> 16:11.200
I mean, this is supposed
to be about me, not you.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.500
Who are you going to see?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.000
You're going to see someone.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.500
It has something to do
with this case.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.600
Take me with you.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.300
Are you playing me?

16:29.700 --> 16:31.100
You've already paid me
for the week.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.500
Why wouldn't you want
to get your money's worth?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.000
All Right

16:42.600 --> 16:49.800
???

16:50.400 --> 16:52.500
The polygraph
seems to back that up.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.300
The police seem to
think she was on her
way to his apartment.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.700
What do you mean?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.700
Oh, come on,
it's not <i>The DaVinci Code.</i>

16:58.800 --> 17:01.500
She told everyone she was going
to school that day,

17:02.300 --> 17:04.099
and, in fact,
she got off the bus,

17:04.300 --> 17:06.200
made her way
towards his apartment.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.700
At least that's
the theory du jour.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.800
I've talked
to Melanie's parents.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.599
I've asked them
to call the boy,

17:14.599 --> 17:16.500
and find out if
I can interview him.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.700
It's not a sure thing;
they haven't said yes.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.599
After all, I haven't given them
a lot for their money so far.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.900
It's going to happen.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.400
You should take me with you.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.300
You're completely playing me.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.500
Fine, if it doesn't happen,
don't take me with you.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.700
I'm just trying to earn my keep.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.500
You said he was 18.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.200
He's not going to know who I am.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.700
You can introduce me
as whoever you want.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.500
I'll think about it.

17:53.900 --> 17:54.900
ARIEL:
 <i>See this picture?</i>

17:54.900 --> 17:57.100
That's my mom.
And the girl next to her, that's

17:57.100 --> 17:58.700
the girl that
I was in my dream.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.500
Okay... but it's
still just a dream.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.100
No, you don't understand.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.400
I saw this picture
in this yearbook,

18:06.400 --> 18:09.200
only that was me
where that girl is now,

18:09.900 --> 18:12.900
in the exact same pose,
in exactly the same clothes.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.200
Well, maybe you've seen
this book before.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.900
Maybe you saw that picture,

18:17.900 --> 18:19.500
and it just got
stuck in your head.

18:19.700 --> 18:23.000
But I haven't; I've never
even heard my mom mention
a girl named Casey before.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.200
Well... maybe you
should tell her.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.800
Maybe you should tell
your mom about your dream,
about this yearbook.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.700
No. No, no...
no way.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.600
I'm so mad at her.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.100
It's weird.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
She was so cool in my dream.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.400
So into the boy who
asked her to the dance.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.200
She would be so disappointed

18:47.200 --> 18:49.100
if she could see
how she turned out.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.600
JOE:
 <i>Okay, here's my strategy.</i>

18:50.600 --> 18:52.000
 <i>I'm paying the mortgage.</i>

18:52.400 --> 18:53.600
Everything else I'm paying,

18:53.600 --> 18:56.800
but I'm paying
with a credit card,
which I'm not paying.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
You listening?

19:00.900 --> 19:02.700
It's important
that you know these details

19:03.100 --> 19:04.900
so that you can testify
in my defense

19:05.200 --> 19:07.000
when they throw me
into debtor's prison.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.800
Well, I look at these things,
I see nothing.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.900
Well, I see things.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.100
(sighing):
You know what?

19:13.100 --> 19:14.900
We'll live without
the 800 bucks.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.000
No, it's not that.
It's this girl.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
Well, I want to help her.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.000
I want to help her parents.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.900
I don't know
what to say, Al.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.200
You know, if you were meant to
be of help, you'd be of help.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.600
You keep telling me what
a jerk this Cynthia woman is.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.500
Huh.
So maybe that's
the news here.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.700
Maybe you're not supposed
to be working with her

19:32.700 --> 19:34.500
on this or
any other case.
(sighs)

19:35.700 --> 19:37.300
(sighs)
Al, it's 11:00.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.000
Would you go in?
I'll be in in a second.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.200
Ariel?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.200
Hey, Ariel, I know
you're not asleep.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.500
I know you're still
mad at me...

20:12.500 --> 20:14.300
I don't know
what to tell you.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.800
You're 14.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.500
There'll be
other concerts.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.300
There'll be other boys.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.400
I just... I can't.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.400
(singing along):
* There is freedom within *

21:02.400 --> 21:04.500
* There is freedom
without *

21:04.500 --> 21:08.400
* Try to catch the deluge
in a paper cup *

21:11.200 --> 21:13.900
* There's a battle ahead *

21:14.200 --> 21:16.200
* Many battles are lost *

21:16.200 --> 21:18.100
Come on, Casey, sing along.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.400
* ...the road while you're
traveling with me *

21:22.300 --> 21:24.200
* Hey now, hey now *

21:24.200 --> 21:25.300
WOMAN:
Allison!

21:25.300 --> 21:27.200
(knock at door)
Okay, I'm shutting it off!

21:27.700 --> 21:29.000
* Hey now *

21:32.400 --> 21:33.800
I hate my mother.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.100
Don't say that.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.500
Why not? You say it all the time
about your parents.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.900
I do?

21:38.900 --> 21:41.600
I hate my parents and
I hate Jordan Spence.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.500
How could he break up with me
just before summer vacation?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.400
I don't know.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.100
How could he break up with you
just before summer vacation?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.400
You know what I was gonna get
him for his birthday?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.400
Know what my big surprise
was gonna be?

21:55.700 --> 21:57.100
Tickets to Crowded House,

21:57.100 --> 21:58.600
his favorite band.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.600
I've never
heard of them.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.700
Really?

22:02.900 --> 22:05.300
Jordan turned me on to them and
now they're like my favorite.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.700
They're coming to
the Orpheum downtown.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.200
I've been saving up money
for months.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.900
You want to go anyway,
you and me?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.400
What are you talking about?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.600
I can't afford that.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.700
I'll lend you the money,
I've got it right here.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.100
Wait a minute, you're not
allowed to go to concerts.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.700
Not until you're 16.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.100
I know.
And neither are you.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.000
What did your father say
the last time

22:29.000 --> 22:30.800
they caught you sneaking
out of the house?

22:30.900 --> 22:32.100
One more time and
they're sending you

22:32.100 --> 22:33.800
to live with
your aunt in Germany.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.200
Well, I'm not waiting a whole
other year to live my life.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.500
I'm not.
The tickets go on sale tomorrow

22:39.500 --> 22:41.600
and I know that they're gonna
sell out in no time.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.500
We should definitely go.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.900
But it's the Orpheum downtown.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.000
And if our mothers
don't take us,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.700
then how are we gonna get there?

22:54.300 --> 22:55.500
This is downtown.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.100
And here's the Orpheum
box office

22:58.100 --> 22:59.600
right on Adams.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.600
Okay.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.900
Well, according to this,

23:02.100 --> 23:04.900
the M-14 bus runs
right up and down Adams.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.800
And what just happens to be at
the other end of Adams?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.900
Why, the Moonlight Roller Rink,
of course.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.100
Okay, but I still don't get it.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.900
Sure you do. I get my mom to
drop us off in the morning,

23:17.100 --> 23:19.100
we hop the bus downtown,
buy the tickets,

23:19.100 --> 23:20.300
then hop on the bus back in time

23:20.300 --> 23:22.400
for your mom to pick us up
at the roller rink.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.500
Oh, my God, I think
that could work.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.100
Of course it'll work.
Why wouldn't it work?

23:27.100 --> 23:29.400
Oh, my God, that could work.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.800
Oh, my God,????

23:40.000 --> 23:41.400
Hey, you see that?
All bad things

23:41.400 --> 23:43.100
don't necessarily
come to an end.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.600
It's Cynthia Keener for you.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.600
I'm taking the girls
to that matinee.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.200
No candy.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.300
No money.

23:49.900 --> 23:50.500
Hello?

23:50.500 --> 23:51.700
Any dreams?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.000
Any breakthroughs?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.700
Afraid not.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.300
Melanie's parents
called the boyfriend.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.000
He's agreed to meet me tonight.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.200
You still interested
in being there?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.000
You still interested
in having me?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.900
Well, like you said,
I already paid you.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.100
I might as well get
my money's worth.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.000
I'll tell him to come around

24:12.000 --> 24:14.200
to that little coffee shop
we meet at.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.600
Can you be there at 7:00?

24:16.600 --> 24:17.700
Oh, wait.

24:18.000 --> 24:18.600
That's about the time

24:18.600 --> 24:21.000
I'm supposed to pick up
my daughter and her friend

24:21.000 --> 24:22.500
from the roller rink.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.900
And my husband just left.

24:24.400 --> 24:24.800
You know what?

24:24.800 --> 24:26.700
I'll just pick them up
a little early.

24:26.700 --> 24:31.100
I can get them both back here
and still be able to get there.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.800
ARIEL:
 <i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

24:32.900 --> 24:35.000
That's the third time
you've thanked me.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.600
Do you think I'm awful?

24:37.700 --> 24:40.800
No. I think you've got a date
with Connor Widomski.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.300
That says it all.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.400
And besides,
your mom lied to you.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.700
I wish you
could've seen her.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.100
She was so cool.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.400
Didn't care when her
parents told her no.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.600
See? You're just doing
what she would've done.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.100
You're just doing
what she <i>did.</i>

25:33.900 --> 25:35.800
I know I'm a little early;
something came up.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.900
Where's Ariel?

25:38.100 --> 25:39.100
Ariel!

25:42.700 --> 25:43.700
Ariel!

25:45.800 --> 25:46.800
I just want
to let you know

25:46.800 --> 25:48.200
I'm probably not going
to be able to make it.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.500
Something came up that's
out of my control.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.400
I am truly sorry.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.700
CYNTHIA:
I don't understand.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.900
Well, to be honest, I don't
really understand myself.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.800
Cynthia, I don't know
what to say.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.900
Well, neither do I.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.800
JOE:
 <i>You lied to us?</i>

26:31.900 --> 26:33.900
Yeah, well, she lied to me.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.000
Excuse me-- lie to you?!

26:38.700 --> 26:41.900
It wasn't me who got on a bus
and went downtown

26:41.900 --> 26:43.400
when they were
told not to.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.400
Yeah, well,
as a matter of fact, it was.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.400
What is she
talking about?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.800
What <i>are</i> you talking about?

26:48.800 --> 26:49.700
You.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.800
You're such a liar.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.300
No concerts until
you were 16?

26:55.200 --> 26:57.700
Yes, I did not go to
a concert by myself

26:57.700 --> 27:00.000
until I was 16--
what is your point?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.600
There it is--
you're doing it again.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.900
You're lying.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.100
I happen to know that
you did go to a concert

27:06.100 --> 27:07.300
with your best friend Casey,

27:07.300 --> 27:09.400
and you did it when
you were in the ninth grade.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.100
Even though
you weren't 16,

27:11.100 --> 27:13.100
even though your parents
said you couldn't.

27:13.200 --> 27:13.900
What?!

27:13.900 --> 27:16.200
And you want to know
how you bought the tickets?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.600
Your told your mom
you were going to go skate,

27:20.100 --> 27:22.000
and you took a bus downtown.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.100
What is going on here?

27:27.700 --> 27:30.200
Is any of this true?
Who told you that?

27:30.500 --> 27:32.300
Nobody told me anything.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.600
I saw it.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.300
I dreamt it.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.000
You had a dream
about me and Casey?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.100
Yeah. Only I was her.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.700
I was Casey.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.400
And you were so cool, Mom.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.700
???

28:05.500 --> 28:06.700
Is she still crying?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.700
No. She's finally asleep.

28:10.700 --> 28:12.600
And you can't sleep
and cry.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.400
She said it had been
the best day of her life

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
and I made it the worst
day of her life.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.000
Want to hear
the funny part?
Mm.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.700
You know that concert
she's talking about--

28:24.700 --> 28:26.300
I never even
made it there.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.300
No?

28:28.700 --> 28:31.600
We got a ride with
this senior who had a car.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.900
He and his buddies were
drinking and smoking
the whole way.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.200
We finally got there,
we were about to go
into the Orpheum,

28:37.200 --> 28:38.900
and there's this cop
at the window.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.900
And when he saw how young
Casey and I were,

28:42.900 --> 28:45.900
he put us in his squad car
and drove us home.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.900
So you really were 16
when you went to your
first concert.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.000
Mm-hmm.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.700
Oh.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.700
So who is this friend--

28:56.800 --> 28:58.300
the one that she's
dreaming about?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.000
Casey Tunstell.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.400
I haven't
spoken to her since, well...

29:03.800 --> 29:07.100
pretty much since the night
of that concert, practically.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.000
We stopped hanging out
after that.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.700
I figure her parents must've
found out it was all my idea.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.300
She just started avoiding me.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.400
I guess they forbade her
to see me.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.100
You know how that goes.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.200
Last chance before
the main event.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
We told you "no."
What's the problem?

29:35.800 --> 29:37.300
Don't you girls know
how to have fun?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.800
Look at her--
she's shaking.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.000
I told you she just doesn't
want to get in trouble.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.300
Her parents are
really strict.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.500
Come on, we're here.
Let's just go inside.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.200
OFFICER:
My goodness.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.800
That's a fragrant aroma
coming from your vehicle.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.300
Can I see your license,
please, sir?

30:12.700 --> 30:14.800
Says here you're 17,
young man.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.100
How about you two
in the back?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.400
You sure look
young to me.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.800
Either of you old enough
to have a license?

30:23.300 --> 30:24.200
OFFICER:
Huh?

30:25.400 --> 30:26.600
I didn't think so.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.700
Your parents know that
you're hanging out with boys,

30:28.700 --> 30:30.000
drinking and smoking?

30:30.100 --> 30:31.500
We didn't drink
or smoke anything.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.200
We just needed a ride.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.700
You two planning on going
to the concert tonight?

30:37.700 --> 30:39.000
Yes, we were, sir.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.800
All right, I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.100
Get out.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.200
What I want you to do

30:45.100 --> 30:48.100
is go in there and sober up.
And I'm gonna be out here

30:48.100 --> 30:49.900
waiting for you
when the concert's over.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.500
And if either one
of you looks

30:51.500 --> 30:53.100
the least bit squirrelly
to me,

30:53.800 --> 30:55.300
not only will you not
be getting behind the wheel

30:55.300 --> 30:58.000
of this car tonight,
but I will see to it

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
 that neither one of you <i>ever</i>
gets behind the wheel

31:01.000 --> 31:02.900
of a motor vehicle ever again.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
You read me?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.200
Yeah. Thank you, Officer.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.100
Okay.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.900
Now, ladies, one more time,

31:09.300 --> 31:10.800
do your parents know
that you're here,

31:10.800 --> 31:11.900
either of you?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.400
Yeah, they know.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.400
Okay, well, give me their phone
numbers, each of you,

31:16.400 --> 31:18.000
and I'll give 'em a call
and confirm that.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.600
I thought so.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.600
Why don't you hop out there?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.900
Get in my car.
I'm taking you ladies home.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.900
Are you gonna
be okay?

31:29.900 --> 31:31.300
Are your parents
gonna be okay?

31:31.300 --> 31:33.200
I remember how they got
that last time.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.900
I'm so sorry, Case.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.200
I can't believe this.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.200
Who knows?
Maybe it's just a dream.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.500
Maybe I'll just wake up.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.800
You poor thing.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.900
Briarwood Place, you said?

31:52.500 --> 31:53.500
Uh-huh.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.100
What I should do right now
is walk up to that door,

32:03.100 --> 32:04.400
knock on it
and tell your folks

32:04.400 --> 32:06.000
where it is I found
you tonight,

32:07.100 --> 32:08.500
but I'm not gonna do that

32:09.100 --> 32:10.300
'cause I suspect
you're smart enough

32:10.300 --> 32:12.000
to know when you've dodged
a bullet.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.000
Now get out of here.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.300
Can my friend come with me?

32:19.700 --> 32:21.700
Her parents, they're
not gonna understand.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.700
Why don't you let me worry
about that?

32:24.800 --> 32:28.200
Or would you rather I escort you
to your door?

32:28.900 --> 32:30.400
No, that's okay.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.400
What'd you say your
name was, young lady?

32:50.400 --> 32:51.700
Casey.

32:52.700 --> 32:56.000
Well, it sounds like your
parents are real strict, huh?

32:57.500 --> 32:58.600
Yeah, that's what I hear.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.800
Yeah. They wouldn't be
too happy if they found out

33:01.800 --> 33:04.000
what you were doing tonight,
would they?

33:04.700 --> 33:07.200
Yeah, but you're not really
gonna tell them.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.300
(sighs)
Well, that depends.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.300
There's my street.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.300
I suppose I could

33:14.300 --> 33:18.000
do you a favor
and not say anything.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.300
You're passing it.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.400
First, you have
to do me a favor.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.100
I'd really like to wake up now.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.100
Pardon me?
Did you say something?

33:32.500 --> 33:33.800
You missed my street.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.600
It's okay.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.900
We're just talking,

33:36.300 --> 33:37.600
getting to know each other.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.900
Okay, I'd really like
to wake up now!

33:40.900 --> 33:42.700
You're a pretty girl,
Casey.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.100
Know that?

33:45.900 --> 33:47.300
A really pretty girl.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
Ariel!

33:55.500 --> 33:56.400
You okay?

33:56.600 --> 33:57.800
What is it?
What is it?!

34:00.700 --> 34:03.200
I couldn't wake up!
I couldn't wake up!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.900
It was so horrible!

34:05.400 --> 34:08.699
???

34:25.300 --> 34:26.800
She's asleep
in our bed.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.400
Well, I'm grateful
that someone is.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.800
Um, I got to ask.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.300
How much of that
actually happened?

34:36.300 --> 34:37.900
Want to hear something scary?

34:38.400 --> 34:41.199
All of it. At least
all of it I was there for.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.699
It happened just like that.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.400
I never heard about
Casey being attacked.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.100
You did say you didn't see

34:47.100 --> 34:49.000
that much of her
after that night.

34:49.199 --> 34:52.600
You know, I don't think
I ever spoke to her after that.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.500
I always assumed
it was her parents.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.800
You know what?
I have to find her.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.800
I have to talk
to her about this.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.500
Tunstell.
T-U-N-S-T-E-L-L.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.000
You know, she could
be married by now.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.700
Her first name,
you know,

35:07.700 --> 35:09.900
could be Cassandra,
for all I know.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.600
I found her, I think.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.500
Well, what
took you so long?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.500
Okay, this is from
the <i>Flagstaff Examiner.</i>

35:17.900 --> 35:20.700
"Pinecrest resident
Casey Tunstell..."

35:21.700 --> 35:23.700
What? What?
Why'd you stop reading?

35:25.700 --> 35:27.300
Ah, she's dead, Al.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Killed in a car accident
almost 12 years ago.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.800
Oh, my God, Casey...

35:36.000 --> 35:37.300
According to this,

35:37.500 --> 35:39.100
she hit a deer.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.400
You know, in all those dreams,
Ariel was Casey.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.400
in the car wreck dreams
that I had

35:47.400 --> 35:50.200
and the high school dreams
that Ariel had.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.600
I just, I can't figure out
the why of it.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.100
I mean, why show us
these things now?

35:57.100 --> 35:58.700
What does it have
to do with anything?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.100
I don't know. It doesn't
make any sense.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.000
A guy attacked her
20 years ago

36:04.000 --> 36:07.100
and she didn't say
anything then when
she was alive.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.300
I mean, why now?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.600
That cop was some judge
of character.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.100
He knew the only way
that Casey could accuse him

36:13.100 --> 36:15.500
of anything would be for her
to tell her parents,

36:15.500 --> 36:18.100
to admit to them
that she snuck out again,

36:18.300 --> 36:20.200
that she disobeyed them again.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.900
And he could sense
she would never do that.

36:24.300 --> 36:27.600
What I don't get
is why I didn't see it.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.100
I was in that car
with him, too.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.700
I let him drive off with her.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.000
Come on, Allison.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.500
You're a teenager.
He's a police officer.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.300
I mean, how do you not
get in that car?

36:38.900 --> 36:40.300
Wait a minute.
Say that again.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.200
When you're that age,
when you're in high school,

36:42.200 --> 36:44.800
I mean, how do you not get
into a police officer's car

36:44.800 --> 36:46.000
when he tells you to?

36:51.300 --> 36:52.000
Good morning.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.400
Good morning. I appreciate you
coming over so quickly.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.000
Oh, that's all right.
I needed to see you anyway.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.200
Now's as good a time as any.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.400
This, uh, obviously isn't
working out.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.100
It's certainly not working out
for me, for my clients.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.200
Melanie's parents
have called in the FBI.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.900
I'll need her books
and things back.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.400
I've been asked to surrender
them to the federal authorities.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.700
As for the money I've paid
you to date, well...

37:22.100 --> 37:24.600
But, uh, going forward,

37:25.700 --> 37:28.400
I don't really believe
there is any going forward.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.800
(sighs) Well, I am sorry
that you feel that way,

37:31.800 --> 37:33.700
especially now that I have
a pretty good idea

37:33.700 --> 37:36.100
how to find her and I was
counting on you for your help,

37:36.200 --> 37:38.200
but let me go get those books.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.600
Um, Allison...

37:42.700 --> 37:44.100
Uh, let me see if I understand
this correctly.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.700
You want a copy of
the I.D. photos

37:45.700 --> 37:49.500
of every officer
working in 1987.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.700
I do.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.400
Wouldn't it just be simpler
to bring whoever

37:54.400 --> 37:56.500
this secret informant is
into the station here

37:56.500 --> 38:01.500
and have him or her
just look over the files?

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
It's not gonna happen,
Detective.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.000
And time is of the essence.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.900
It's our guy.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.900
Can I help you?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.300
Ben Talmadge?

38:50.300 --> 38:52.300
 <i>Officer</i> Ben Talmadge.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.800
What can I do for you,
Detective?

38:55.300 --> 38:57.600
I was wondering
if I might take a look
inside your house.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.000
You have a warrant?

39:00.500 --> 39:02.700
No, but I can
get one.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.900
We can all wait
around till it arrives,

39:05.800 --> 39:07.900
or you can invite me in
to take a look around.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.900
You know, I retire...
a week and a half.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.700
Made a lot of, a lot of plans.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.600
A lot of preparations.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.200
You're not gonna do anything
to screw that up,

39:27.800 --> 39:29.100
are you, Detective?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.900
That'd be up to you, sir.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.300
That'd be up to you.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.400
REPORTER:
 <i>16-year-old Melanie Daniels</i>

39:36.400 --> 39:38.000
was rescued late this evening

39:38.200 --> 39:39.800
after being missing
for four days,

39:39.800 --> 39:42.200
based on information supplied
by Ameritips,

39:42.200 --> 39:45.200
which aided in the investigation
at the parents' request.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.900
Her abductor, a policeman,
is believed to have lured

39:47.900 --> 39:50.200
the 16-year-old
into his patrol car

39:50.300 --> 39:51.100
and kept her prisoner in the
basement of his home...

39:51.100 --> 39:53.900
Come on. Time to
get up, go to bed.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.300
It's 2:00
in the morning.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.600
Wait a second.
I was watching that.
No, you weren't.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.800
That's the 2:00 a.m.
rebroadcast of the
11:00 news.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.100
You've seen it already.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.200
To hear them tell it,

40:06.200 --> 40:08.300
Ameritips did the whole
thing by themselves.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.400
Your friend Cynthia's
gonna be very happy.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.600
No mention of you,
no mention of Ariel.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.100
Well, that's fine
with me.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.300
I'm just happy
that the girl's safe

40:19.700 --> 40:21.900
and I'm still on the payroll.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.200
You go ahead.
I'll be in in a minute.

40:50.300 --> 40:53.200
* There is freedom within *

40:53.200 --> 40:55.400
* There is freedom without *

40:55.400 --> 40:58.400
* Try to catch the deluge
in a paper cup... *

40:58.400 --> 41:01.000
You know, I'm really glad
we're doing this.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.500
You don't hate me?
Come on, Mom.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.600
I wouldn't be
having this dream
if I hated you.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.500
* Many battles are lost, but
you'll never see *

41:08.500 --> 41:11.900
* The end of the road while
you're traveling with me *

41:13.200 --> 41:21.200
* Hey now, hey now,
don't dream it's over... *
