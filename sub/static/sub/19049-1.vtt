WEBVTT

00:01.956 --> 00:04.059
Look, bro, I'm only gonna
be here for about ten minutes.

00:04.126 --> 00:04.893
I got to get my pump on.

00:04.960 --> 00:05.894
I have a very big day.

00:05.961 --> 00:06.895
I'm sorry.

00:06.962 --> 00:07.896
I can't let you in.

00:08.468 --> 00:11.384
I don't understand why you're
insisting on jamming me up here, bro.

00:11.416 --> 00:13.266
I'm not trying to jam you up.

00:13.649 --> 00:14.847
I just don't believe you.

00:15.403 --> 00:16.550
What is not to believe?

00:16.670 --> 00:18.406
I am absolutely Dennis Reynolds.

00:19.622 --> 00:20.957
This picture looks nothing like you.

00:21.202 --> 00:22.338
Well, thank you.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.853
Because I have actually packed
on about 15 or 20 pounds of

00:24.973 --> 00:27.075
solid bulk muscle since that
picture was taken, bro.

00:27.108 --> 00:28.853
It's actually a testament to your gym.

00:28.973 --> 00:31.486
I'm gonna need you to either buy
your own membership, or get out.

00:31.554 --> 00:32.997
Mac?

00:33.117 --> 00:33.841
Yeah.

00:34.183 --> 00:35.748
Hey, tranny.

00:36.085 --> 00:36.782
Carmen.

00:36.817 --> 00:37.865
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

00:37.940 --> 00:38.493
How you doing?

00:38.561 --> 00:39.709
Wow. You look great.

00:39.829 --> 00:41.275
Sweet camel toe.

00:41.496 --> 00:42.533
That's a good tuck job.

00:42.497 --> 00:43.469
You have it taped back there?

00:43.498 --> 00:44.913
No.
It's good.

00:45.033 --> 00:46.003
It's actually gone.

00:46.449 --> 00:47.967
I had the surgery.

00:48.087 --> 00:49.286
Get out.

00:49.406 --> 00:50.773
That's fantastic.

00:50.911 --> 00:52.461
I thought I was gonna get a phone call

00:52.480 --> 00:54.390
after the old snip snip,
'cause we talked about that, but...

00:54.510 --> 00:56.511
Either way, now that your
dick-less, I'm into it.

00:57.623 --> 00:59.020
What are you doing this afternoon?

00:59.140 --> 00:59.781
How's it going?

01:00.386 --> 01:06.294
Uh, it's going good, pal, but,
uh, the lady isn't interested.

01:06.414 --> 01:10.459
Uh, Mac, I would like you
to meet my husband, Nick.

01:11.411 --> 01:12.638
Husband?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.561
You're married.

01:16.161 --> 01:17.665
Great.

01:52.436 --> 01:53.796
Now, what
are you guys saying?

01:53.863 --> 01:54.563
They're good almonds, right?

01:54.631 --> 01:55.564
They are tasty.

01:55.632 --> 01:56.476
These almonds?
Yeah, they're fine.

01:56.596 --> 01:59.214
I found them in, like, in a
little pile in the alleyway.

01:59.334 --> 02:01.904
A squirrel must have piled them
up and then got hit by a car.

02:01.971 --> 02:02.738
Why? Why? Why? Why?

02:02.806 --> 02:04.573
Why did you feed us alley almonds?

02:04.641 --> 02:05.447
Why wouldn't you tell us that?

02:05.567 --> 02:06.660
No. They're perfectly good.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.859
I just... Guys. Guys, guys, I've
got news; I've got huge news.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.584
So I went down to the gym
this morning, right?

02:11.704 --> 02:14.401
I was all amped up, 'cause Charlie
and I found a bunch of nuts.

02:14.521 --> 02:16.366
I was so full of protein, okay?

02:16.486 --> 02:19.597
I went to get my pump on, but
I couldn't get my pump on.

02:19.897 --> 02:20.819
Now I know what you're thinking.

02:20.939 --> 02:22.831
Clearly, I did get my pump on,
but that's 'cause I just did a

02:22.868 --> 02:24.427
bunch of push-ups outside.

02:24.547 --> 02:25.455
Also, why I'm out of breath.

02:25.596 --> 02:27.080
What in God's name are
you talking about?

02:27.108 --> 02:27.831
Is this the big news?

02:28.156 --> 02:30.344
No. I ran into the tranny.

02:31.136 --> 02:34.488
She got her dick cut off,
and she married a dude.

02:34.994 --> 02:36.290
Oh, that's great.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.035
Congratulations to her.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.021
No, that is not great.

02:39.141 --> 02:39.700
No?

02:39.831 --> 02:41.005
That is a gay marriage.

02:41.115 --> 02:42.767
Uh, I got a question for you.

02:43.227 --> 02:44.786
One's a girl... One's a guy...

02:45.022 --> 02:46.449
- Yeah.
- And how is that gay?

02:47.191 --> 02:50.521
Well, for starters, clearly, her
husband is a homosexual, okay?

02:51.085 --> 02:52.859
Why are you making that assumption?

02:52.860 --> 02:54.384
Because he's with a tranny?

02:54.437 --> 02:55.832
You were with the tranny.
What are you saying?

02:56.024 --> 02:59.026
No, Charlie, that is completely
different, and you know it.

02:59.117 --> 02:59.943
Yeah. No. He's right.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.026
That's different, 'cause this
new guy... if I'm hearing correctly...

03:02.069 --> 03:05.402
he waited until she got her
dick cut off before he banged her.

03:05.487 --> 03:06.197
But that means...
No.

03:06.492 --> 03:07.158
Wait.

03:07.224 --> 03:09.940
Look, who gives a shit if gays
want to be miserable like

03:10.060 --> 03:11.225
everybody else and get married?

03:11.272 --> 03:12.164
Let 'em do it.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.699
It's no skin off my ass.

03:13.765 --> 03:15.422
No. Marriage is a
wonderful thing.

03:15.488 --> 03:17.647
It's between two people who
decide they want to spend

03:17.685 --> 03:20.234
the rest of their lives together because
they love each other very much.

03:20.272 --> 03:22.431
I'm all for it, and I think
everyone should be entitled to it.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.357
Oh, oh, everybody up on their high
horse of marriage all of a sudden.

03:25.582 --> 03:27.780
Marriage is about procreation, okay?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.097
This is gay marriage.

03:29.702 --> 03:31.242
That's two dudes banging each other.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.298
What do you get from that?

03:32.406 --> 03:33.730
Nothing. Nothing.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.584
Uh, that is a persuasive argument.

03:35.626 --> 03:39.250
You should take your powerful extension
cord argument straight to the Supreme Court.

03:39.370 --> 03:40.316
Mm-hmm.
They'll love it there.

03:40.369 --> 03:41.697
Run that right up the ladder, right?

03:41.732 --> 03:43.480
No. Run it up the ladder...
Mac, dude, look, I think

03:43.517 --> 03:45.817
you're just getting upset that
the tranny married some guy

03:45.937 --> 03:47.416
that's not you, and that's
what this is about.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.927
No, no, Charlie, this is
about the big man upstairs,

03:49.967 --> 03:51.327
- okay, getting boxed out.
- Oh, geez.

03:51.447 --> 03:55.039
It very clearly says in the bible
that gay marriage is wrong, okay?

03:55.159 --> 03:55.818
And I'm gonna show you.

03:55.847 --> 03:56.385
Where's our bible?

03:56.452 --> 03:57.386
Where's our bible?

03:57.453 --> 03:58.947
Where's our goddamn bible?

03:59.067 --> 04:00.502
- We don't have a bible in here.
- Yeah.

04:00.622 --> 04:01.563
Why don't we have a bible?

04:01.683 --> 04:02.474
We never have.

04:02.594 --> 04:03.516
It's a bar.

04:04.822 --> 04:06.333
Okay, I see what's happening here.

04:06.897 --> 04:08.823
All right, I don't have enough
facts to support my argument.

04:08.943 --> 04:09.522
Clearly.

04:09.642 --> 04:11.878
But I'm gonna find a bible,
and then I'm gonna come back,

04:11.915 --> 04:13.474
and I'm gonna school you
sons of bitches, okay?

04:13.594 --> 04:15.070
Because you guys are
trying to confuse me.

04:15.138 --> 04:17.375
You're trying to confuse me,
because that's what God's work...

04:21.641 --> 04:24.076
Uh... Oh, he's getting
himself all worked up, huh?

04:24.144 --> 04:25.247
Yeah. Very worked up.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.026
Very worked up.

04:26.052 --> 04:27.855
You know, I always thought
I'd be married by now.

04:29.163 --> 04:30.239
- What?
- What?

04:31.736 --> 04:32.497
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

04:32.534 --> 04:34.844
I... All that talk about marriage
and everything... it's got me

04:34.872 --> 04:37.933
thinking about myself and my
situation, and I guess I always

04:37.979 --> 04:39.220
thought I'd be married by now.

04:40.855 --> 04:43.071
What the shit are you talking about?

04:43.324 --> 04:45.573
Frank, I'm talking about
Maureen Ponderosa.

04:45.693 --> 04:48.768
Oh, my God, dude, don't
start in on this.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.462
Maureen Ponderosa was my
girlfriend in tenth grade, and

04:51.582 --> 04:52.973
we were so in love.

04:53.016 --> 04:54.950
You remember Maureen
Ponderosa, right, Charlie?

04:55.005 --> 04:56.884
I remember her dead tooth, dude.

04:57.004 --> 04:58.410
What? Dead tooth?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.851
- She didn't have a dead tooth.
- You guys remember her brother, Bill?

05:00.971 --> 05:02.095
Bill Ponderosa?

05:03.073 --> 05:04.829
Boy, that guy was like a walking clichÃ©.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.451
He was hot, great buns.

05:06.571 --> 05:09.521
Yeah, and I remember, every time you
tried to talk to him, you'd (gags).

05:09.641 --> 05:10.732
I got a little gaggy.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.765
It's only 'cause he made me nervous,
but he was very handsome.

05:13.802 --> 05:16.188
What is it with you two
and the Ponderosas?

05:16.308 --> 05:17.756
I think I might call her up, actually.

05:21.998 --> 05:23.155
Charlie, not in the corner.

05:23.173 --> 05:25.305
Put 'em in the closet,
tuck 'em in the back.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.414
All right, Frank.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.001
Pick it up.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.149
There you go.

05:29.269 --> 05:30.157
Come on...
Oh!

05:30.277 --> 05:31.557
Not on the floor!

05:31.677 --> 05:32.314
Oh! Dude, my back.

05:32.434 --> 05:33.635
Charlie, look at this.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.953
I've been saving these for years.
What?

05:36.073 --> 05:37.814
I think I slipped a disk, man.

05:37.934 --> 05:40.267
Stand straight or something.

05:40.387 --> 05:42.185
Ugh! Frank, I got to go
see a chiropractor again.

05:42.305 --> 05:44.799
Oh, right, I just keep
paying medical bills, right?

05:44.919 --> 05:45.653
Is that it? Come on...
Come on.

05:45.773 --> 05:47.306
- I keep lugging pennies.
- You're in pain?

05:47.426 --> 05:48.954
Here, let me hit you
with a two-by-four.

05:49.074 --> 05:49.823
You won't feel anything.

05:49.943 --> 05:51.489
No. I don't want to
play that game anymore.

05:51.609 --> 05:52.483
All right, crack my back.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.079
All right, can you
crack my back, please?

05:54.199 --> 05:55.004
Crack your back.

05:55.124 --> 05:56.614
All right, come on, turn around.

05:56.734 --> 05:58.132
All right... Give me that.
You ready?

06:01.472 --> 06:03.180
Did you get my back?

06:03.300 --> 06:04.496
Oh, my back. Oh!

06:04.616 --> 06:06.120
I'll get you... Oh...

06:06.240 --> 06:07.219
Oh. Aah!

06:07.339 --> 06:08.787
I need it again.

06:12.044 --> 06:15.391
Oh! Oh!

06:15.511 --> 06:16.525
Charlie, don't touch me.

06:16.791 --> 06:19.025
- Don't touch me.
- All right, all right.

06:19.092 --> 06:20.726
This is gonna sound crazy.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.701
I just got an idea.

06:22.821 --> 06:25.841
If we do that domestic
partnership thing that gay guys

06:25.961 --> 06:29.159
can do, I can totally get
on your health insurance.

06:29.279 --> 06:31.103
You won't even have to pay
for the chiropractor.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.919
You proposing to me?

06:34.106 --> 06:35.221
Come on, man.

06:35.341 --> 06:37.926
No. I'm saying, we're
already friends, right?

06:38.886 --> 06:40.951
Let's be friends with benefits, right?

06:41.071 --> 06:42.039
Oh, yeah.

06:42.159 --> 06:43.762
You get your back fixed.

06:43.882 --> 06:45.151
What's in it for me?

06:45.188 --> 06:47.127
All right, man, there's got
to be a reason why all those

06:47.247 --> 06:48.202
couples want to do it, right?

06:48.322 --> 06:49.308
Uh, perks, right?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.689
We can at least look
into what goes into it?

06:52.193 --> 06:53.707
I really got to see a
chiropractor, man.

06:53.827 --> 06:54.883
All right, all right, look into it.

06:55.003 --> 06:56.767
I mean, you got to hit
me with the two-by-four.

06:56.887 --> 06:57.705
I got too much pain.

06:57.825 --> 06:58.839
- It's bad on me, too.
- It's bad.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.729
All right, I got you.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.015
Hit me good.

07:05.177 --> 07:06.105
Phew!

07:06.173 --> 07:07.106
I feel really nervous, Dee.

07:07.174 --> 07:09.447
I haven't seen Maureen in,
like, close to 15 years.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.274
- I was really in love with that girl, huh?
- Yeah.

07:11.394 --> 07:13.901
No girl has ever really had
this effect on me, so I don't

07:13.923 --> 07:15.440
know how to deal with it.
It's crazy.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.023
Yeah. I know what you mean. I feel a lot
of butterflies myself, you know.

07:18.143 --> 07:21.852
I mean it's like "I'm gonna
see Bill Ponderosa gahh.."

07:22.884 --> 07:23.976
Is that gonna happen? Relax.

07:24.096 --> 07:24.774
Maybe bubbly water.

07:24.894 --> 07:26.300
Maybe if you get me some bubbly water.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.535
Slow down and get...
Here we go.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.981
- Dennis!
- Hey, Maureen! Wow.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.443
Look at you. You look amazing!

07:31.563 --> 07:32.760
You look amazing.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.644
Oh.

07:33.764 --> 07:35.045
Who's this?
Is this your husband?

07:35.165 --> 07:36.729
- Oh. This is Bill.
- Hey, guys.

07:36.849 --> 07:39.879
Bill? No. Wow.

07:41.331 --> 07:42.765
Wow, right?

07:42.885 --> 07:45.090
I would not have guessed that was you.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.584
Yeah, I gained a little weight.

07:46.704 --> 07:47.690
Did you now?

07:47.810 --> 07:51.849
Oh, well, no, it's hardly
noticeable, hardly noticeable.

07:51.969 --> 07:53.146
I do notice the ring, though.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.826
Oh, good for you.
You got married. That's good.

07:54.844 --> 07:55.607
Yeah. Yeah, ten years now.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.833
Yeah, she's amazing.
So are my two kids.

07:57.953 --> 07:58.729
Oh.

07:58.849 --> 08:00.452
Huh? Want to see little...
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

08:00.572 --> 08:01.686
I don't really.

08:01.806 --> 08:03.156
I mean, it's great, but
you know what I mean.

08:03.276 --> 08:05.117
Nobody really wants to see that.

08:05.475 --> 08:08.954
Goddamn, this has been a really
fun walk down memory lane.

08:09.074 --> 08:12.834
Uh, Maureen, great to see you,
and, Bill, take care of yourself

08:12.954 --> 08:15.439
or whatever... people say.

08:15.559 --> 08:16.377
Okay. Excuse me?

08:16.497 --> 08:17.316
All right.

08:18.245 --> 08:21.364
Well, uh, yeah, well, this is
has got to be a little awkward

08:21.484 --> 08:22.120
for you now, Bill, right?

08:22.240 --> 08:26.318
'Cause you're here, and we're
sort of having a... you know,

08:26.375 --> 08:28.135
probably gonna have a little
sit-down breakfast, and now

08:28.319 --> 08:31.213
you're a bit of a third wheel, kind of
wormed your way into our situation.

08:31.332 --> 08:32.102
Yeah. Not really.

08:32.191 --> 08:34.496
You know, I just came
to catch up, so... No.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.154
But I can leave you
guys alone, I guess.

08:37.325 --> 08:38.979
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

08:39.099 --> 08:40.265
Hey, take care of yourself.

08:40.332 --> 08:41.500
It was good to see you.

08:41.568 --> 08:42.847
- Yeah. I got to pick up the kids.
- Sure, pick up the kids, yeah.

08:42.967 --> 08:43.827
Bye, Bill.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.278
- Uh...Hey, you want to sit down?
- Yeah.

08:47.398 --> 08:49.172
Great. Hey, God, man.

08:49.292 --> 08:50.452
Maureen Ponderosa.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.731
I can't even believe those words
are coming out of my mouth.

08:52.851 --> 08:53.711
I know.

08:53.831 --> 08:54.901
God, look at you.

08:55.377 --> 08:56.316
Look at you.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.312
You look great. You're still quite a catch.
You look just like you did in high school.

08:59.432 --> 09:00.292
Oh.

09:00.412 --> 09:01.878
Hey, do you remember all the
good times that we used to have

09:01.998 --> 09:04.174
in the back of your dad's
Datsun behind this place?

09:04.294 --> 09:05.182
Oh, man.

09:05.302 --> 09:07.640
So much romance. Mm.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.194
Hey, how is your dad?

09:09.314 --> 09:10.805
Dad died last year.

09:11.561 --> 09:13.040
- Did he die?
- Yeah.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.972
Oh, that's... that's too bad.

09:15.092 --> 09:16.471
It happens, you know.

09:16.591 --> 09:18.070
He was getting up there, right?

09:18.138 --> 09:20.219
- I mean, it was probably
natural causes, or... - Suicide.

09:20.339 --> 09:22.447
- Sui... Suicide?
- Car exhaust, yeah.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.304
I had to break the window
of the Datsun, so...

09:25.424 --> 09:27.151
Oh, yeah, it was one of those.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.544
- One of those, huh?
- His eyes were so yellow.

09:29.664 --> 09:30.510
Okay.

09:32.106 --> 09:35.316
Maureen Ponderosa...

09:35.436 --> 09:37.331
Yeah.. Yeah...

09:37.332 --> 09:41.332
Dennis Reynolds and Maureen Ponderosa
back together again at last.

09:47.679 --> 09:48.531
Hey, Carmen.

09:49.264 --> 09:51.180
Carmen, hey, I want to
show you something.

09:51.281 --> 09:53.303
Oh. Hey, Mac.

09:53.423 --> 09:54.445
- Yeah.
- What's going on here?

09:54.565 --> 09:57.023
Oh, good. I'm glad you're here, too, okay,
'cause this pertains to both of you guys.

09:57.143 --> 09:59.922
I'm about to do you guys a huge solid.

10:00.230 --> 10:01.443
Ready?

10:01.511 --> 10:06.023
"Men with men committing
indecent acts... " sex in the but",

10:06.143 --> 10:09.100
... will receive the due
penalty for their perversion."

10:10.732 --> 10:11.579
Word of the Lord.

10:11.699 --> 10:13.810
Okay, what is it you're
trying to say, Mac?

10:13.930 --> 10:16.513
I'm saying that in the eyes of
the Lord, your marriage is an

10:16.633 --> 10:19.261
abomination, and if you don't get
a divorce, you're going to hell.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.263
I love people tripping all the time.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.264
Can I see that for a second?

10:22.331 --> 10:24.114
Yeah, but I'm not tripping, okay?
It's all right there.

10:24.234 --> 10:25.164
Oh, no.

10:25.284 --> 10:26.102
Yeah, just... it's gonna take
you a little while to flip

10:26.222 --> 10:27.680
through it, 'cause that
book is long as shit.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.010
Oh, yeah, I like this one.

10:29.130 --> 10:29.794
Yeah.

10:29.914 --> 10:30.956
Exodus 21, verses 20, 21.

10:31.076 --> 10:32.049
Mm.

10:32.169 --> 10:35.400
"When a man strikes his slave
with a rod so hard that the

10:35.421 --> 10:37.468
slave dies, he shall be punished.

10:38.070 --> 10:41.998
If, however, the slave survives
for a day or two, he is not to

10:42.118 --> 10:43.849
be punished, for the
slave is his property."

10:43.969 --> 10:45.753
That's-That's not what I'm
talking about, though.

10:45.873 --> 10:47.477
That's a different...
That's not my thing.

10:47.597 --> 10:50.319
Well, so you're saying you're gonna
whoop my black ass with a rod

10:50.340 --> 10:51.496
as long as you like it,

10:51.616 --> 10:54.113
As long as I get up after
a day or two we are good?

10:54.364 --> 10:55.296
That's what you're telling me?

10:55.416 --> 10:59.744
No, I wouldn't whoop on you with anything,
whether you were my slave or not.

10:59.864 --> 11:04.401
It's just... That doesn't really pertain anyway,
because that section is not from the same time.

11:04.521 --> 11:07.015
Oh, oh, really? Well, what time
is your section from, Mac?

11:07.309 --> 11:09.255
Look, I came here to
help you guys, okay?

11:09.375 --> 11:11.711
And as a gay man, there's certain things
you need to know about the afterlife.

11:11.831 --> 11:13.461
I'm not a gay man.

11:13.581 --> 11:15.002
Yes, you are.

11:15.122 --> 11:16.283
You're banging a dude.

11:16.403 --> 11:19.658
Look, if anything, you're the one
that had sex with me when I was a man.

11:20.876 --> 11:22.714
Oh, that's it... you're gay.

11:22.834 --> 11:25.094
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
He's gay.

11:25.214 --> 11:28.800
If this is about you and
me, then just say that.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.293
I'm never going to admit that, Carmen.

11:31.413 --> 11:34.410
But come on, I mean... him?

11:34.774 --> 11:36.791
What do you see in this guy?

11:36.911 --> 11:39.370
I mean, look at my
body compared to his.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.190
I'm a hard body.
You're a hard body.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.447
We could be hard bodies together.

11:42.495 --> 11:44.042
Not hard body and...

11:44.162 --> 11:47.628
I thought we established that there was
going to be a phone call after the procedure.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.967
And then you had the procedure,
and I never got that call.

11:50.087 --> 11:53.150
Instead you called this soft
body and you gay married him.

11:53.270 --> 11:56.465
And now you're calling me gay,
telling me I'm tripping and

11:56.585 --> 11:59.807
trying to confuse me with
your liberal Biblisisms.

12:00.325 --> 12:03.813
Man, my guess is is you've been
confused for a very long time.

12:10.557 --> 12:11.789
All right, take it easy.

12:11.909 --> 12:13.469
Oh, oh, oh.

12:13.589 --> 12:14.575
Thank you very much.

12:15.191 --> 12:18.690
All right, dude, okay, I admit this is more
paperwork than I expected, all right?

12:18.810 --> 12:20.496
But that's... Frank that's
because this domestic

12:20.616 --> 12:22.756
partnership thing is
really worth doing, dude.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.730
There's a lot of perks in
these bad boys, you know?

12:24.850 --> 12:26.607
There's a lot of jelly in
these doughnuts here, Frank.

12:26.727 --> 12:29.891
But, Charlie, you still haven't told me how
this shit is going to be good for me. Me.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.076
It's all in here.

12:31.535 --> 12:32.998
All right, okay, all right,
think about this for a second.

12:33.118 --> 12:35.182
Now you're definitely going
to have another massive heart attack

12:35.302 --> 12:36.709
or stroke in the
next few years, right?

12:36.829 --> 12:37.475
Definitely.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.897
All right, well, what's going to happen
when you go on life support, dude?

12:40.017 --> 12:42.613
Dennis and Dee are going to pull
the plug on you so fast,

12:42.733 --> 12:43.509
your head is going to spin.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.169
But think about this, Frank, you
know who's not going to do that?

12:46.450 --> 12:48.645
This guy right here.

12:48.765 --> 12:51.726
This thing... this is so much
complicated stuff, Charlie.

12:51.846 --> 12:52.918
Look who it is?

12:53.038 --> 12:54.836
Guys, you remember Maureen
Ponderosa, right?

12:54.956 --> 12:56.153
Charlie!

12:56.273 --> 12:58.834
Hey, Maureen, how are you?

12:58.954 --> 13:00.819
Dead tooth.
Let me see the dead tooth.

13:00.939 --> 13:02.093
What's he talking about?

13:02.213 --> 13:04.558
Oh, he's, uh...
Pipe down, Frank, pipe down.

13:04.678 --> 13:06.250
So listen, guys, we just got married.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.552
- What?
- Yeah.

13:07.672 --> 13:09.806
Yeah, we're married. Maureen
and I got married.

13:09.926 --> 13:11.122
What is wrong with you?

13:11.242 --> 13:13.494
It's not what's wrong with
me, Frank, it's what's right with me,

13:13.532 --> 13:16.557
and that's this little piece of paper
right here that we just signed.

13:16.677 --> 13:19.053
It's our marriage certificate.
Now we're married. Boom.

13:19.093 --> 13:19.810
Hold on a second.

13:19.846 --> 13:21.521
You just had to sign a
little piece of paper.

13:21.641 --> 13:24.433
They gave Frank and I, like, a
million forms for our marriage.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.302
You guys are trying to
get married too, huh?

13:26.422 --> 13:27.352
That's weird.

13:27.472 --> 13:28.598
Uh-huh, yeah.

13:28.718 --> 13:29.733
Well, we're out of here.

13:29.853 --> 13:31.413
So, good luck.

13:31.533 --> 13:34.269
Oh, my God, what is
the matter with him?

13:34.389 --> 13:35.250
Did you smell her breath?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.054
Are you kidding me?

13:36.104 --> 13:38.662
It smelled like she was nibbling
on little pieces of shit.

13:40.874 --> 13:42.092
Wait a second, wait a second.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.091
Dennis, you're married?

13:44.309 --> 13:45.305
Yes, man, I'm married.

13:45.355 --> 13:46.130
I'm a married man.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.262
Yes, she's actually here, dude.

13:47.305 --> 13:48.505
It's awesome.
She's in the bathroom.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.555
She's brushing her teeth.

13:49.675 --> 13:51.922
Yeah, she must have eaten
something a little bit sinister.

13:52.042 --> 13:53.369
Must have been the Funyuns
or something, I don't know.

13:53.489 --> 13:54.363
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

13:54.483 --> 13:57.677
Anyway, the point is, I am having, this
is crazy, but I'm having feelings again.

13:57.797 --> 14:00.058
Like-like some kind of
14-year-old kid or something.

14:00.178 --> 14:01.659
You remember feelings, right?

14:02.485 --> 14:05.076
Yeah. I have feelings every
single day of my life.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.792
Do you? Are you saying
you don't have feelings?

14:08.646 --> 14:10.158
Well, I'm saying I built up a shell.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.582
A shell around myself.

14:11.702 --> 14:14.914
A cold, calculated, heartless
shell that couldn't be broken by

14:15.034 --> 14:16.021
anything but marriage.

14:16.141 --> 14:19.406
And that's what she did, dude... she
broke that shell with marriage.

14:19.910 --> 14:21.955
In a good way, if I'm being unclear.

14:22.504 --> 14:25.192
And that brings me,
actually, to my next point.

14:25.312 --> 14:28.272
I need you to move out...
like now, like right away.

14:28.847 --> 14:29.974
What?!

14:30.094 --> 14:32.129
Why do I have to move out?
It's my apartment, too.

14:32.165 --> 14:33.886
Uh, actually, you know what, Mac?

14:34.006 --> 14:37.584
Turns out it's not your apartment, because
you never signed the lease, if you recall.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.425
'Cause your credit was so bad.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.323
Oh.

14:40.443 --> 14:42.787
Well, what am I going to
do with all my stuff?

14:42.907 --> 14:44.762
You know what, believe it or
not, I've been doing some inventory...

14:44.808 --> 14:48.824
and it turns out you don't actually
own anything in this apartment.

14:48.944 --> 14:51.785
- That can't be true.
- It's shockingly true.

14:51.905 --> 14:54.936
Yeah, yeah, every single
thing in here is mine.

14:55.056 --> 14:57.390
For instance, that shirt that
you're wearing right now.

14:57.510 --> 14:58.608
That was my shirt.

14:58.728 --> 15:00.751
And then I got tired of it, I
threw it in the trash and then

15:00.871 --> 15:03.469
you fished it out of the trash
and you cut the sleeves off it,

15:03.522 --> 15:06.508
as you are want to do, 'cause
that's your thing, but whatever.

15:06.628 --> 15:09.365
Also, listen, I don't want to
rush you on this either, but I

15:09.485 --> 15:12.356
did have to drop you from my
cell phone's family plan.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.849
Oh, and I'm going to need you to
stop using my name at the gym.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.734
Because I'm getting a lot of
phone calls about that and

15:16.768 --> 15:18.145
that's a little embarrassing.

15:18.173 --> 15:19.477
- Can I say something?
- Yeah, totally.

15:25.235 --> 15:26.969
Oh, there we go.

15:27.037 --> 15:28.171
Oh, hey.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.635
Hey, how you doing?

15:29.755 --> 15:30.511
Hey, hey, hey.

15:30.631 --> 15:31.407
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:31.475 --> 15:32.642
- Hey. You got a minute?
- No.

15:32.678 --> 15:34.227
- Got a question. Got a minute?
- Quick question.

15:34.246 --> 15:36.152
Yeah, I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now.

15:36.272 --> 15:37.127
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

15:38.199 --> 15:39.003
That's easy.

15:39.123 --> 15:39.882
Okay, no problem.

15:39.950 --> 15:40.906
That's better.

15:41.026 --> 15:42.849
Why do you people keep
bothering me at the gym?

15:42.918 --> 15:44.458
I'm so sorry.
It's going to be a quick question.

15:44.516 --> 15:45.827
- Charlie... you remember me, right?
- Yeah.

15:45.885 --> 15:48.157
- Frank.
- No, I don't remember you.

15:48.225 --> 15:50.993
Look, my friend and I, we're
trying to get, like, a gay

15:51.061 --> 15:54.030
marriage situation going on and he's
all tripped up about some issue.

15:54.097 --> 15:55.598
And now he's uncomfortable
talking to me.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.856
I figured you're a expert,
so we could talk to you.

15:57.976 --> 15:59.720
All right, fine.
Jut go ahead... what?

15:59.840 --> 16:00.868
Good. Go.

16:00.988 --> 16:03.487
Charlie and I... we're
going to get married.

16:03.607 --> 16:04.481
Mm-hmm.

16:04.601 --> 16:08.686
Who would be the man and who would
be the woman in that situation?

16:09.414 --> 16:10.947
Neither of you would be the woman.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.499
You're both men.

16:13.269 --> 16:14.347
Are you kidding me?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.796
Is this what you've been
upset about the whole time?

16:16.861 --> 16:18.187
Which one of us is
going to be the woman?

16:18.255 --> 16:18.954
Yeah.

16:19.022 --> 16:21.290
I'm not going to get my dick
cut off and sold to China.

16:21.358 --> 16:24.126
Spend the rest of my life on
a treadmill like this guy.

16:24.246 --> 16:26.109
What are you...?
What?!

16:26.229 --> 16:27.745
I don't want to be the woman, Charlie.

16:27.865 --> 16:29.753
And I don't want to
see you be the woman.

16:29.873 --> 16:32.170
Neither of us would
be the woman, dude.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.588
We would both be men.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.578
We'd be two cool straight
dudes married together.

16:37.292 --> 16:40.309
Oh. I never thought
of it that way.

16:40.377 --> 16:43.647
Two dudes getting married...
that doesn't seem very gay.

16:43.767 --> 16:47.301
Yeah, right?
It's not... Yeah, right, yeah, okay.

16:47.421 --> 16:49.785
You know what, let's not argue on
this or think about it too much.

16:49.853 --> 16:50.453
No.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.628
Two cool married... dudes.

16:52.749 --> 16:53.648
Not gay.

16:53.688 --> 16:54.423
I'm down with that.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.074
- All right.
- Excuse me.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.692
- Bump it, bump it, bump it.
- Gay dudes married.

16:56.760 --> 16:57.359
Two gay dudes married.

16:57.427 --> 16:59.328
Is my role in this done now?

16:59.396 --> 17:01.698
Uh, any more questions?

17:01.818 --> 17:03.624
No. I think I got it.

17:03.744 --> 17:05.501
Hey, did they really
sell your dick to China?

17:07.273 --> 17:09.508
No. I can tell by your stare
the answer is no.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.416
I told you, Frank. That's crazy.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.325
Dee, hey, we got to talk.

17:19.651 --> 17:22.297
Wait. You can't just come barging in
here like that. What are you doing?

17:22.352 --> 17:24.744
Okay, look, it takes a big
man to admit defeat,

17:24.865 --> 17:26.929
but you were right, I was wrong.

17:27.173 --> 17:29.281
Everybody should be able to get
married to whoever they want.

17:29.401 --> 17:31.074
Which got me thinking
about you and me.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.996
Oh, no, I'm not going to marry you,
if that's where this is headed.

17:34.064 --> 17:35.064
What?

17:35.785 --> 17:37.600
Dee, I would rather
get shot in the face.

17:37.948 --> 17:39.335
Okay, then what are you doing here?

17:39.402 --> 17:40.269
I'm glad you asked.

17:40.337 --> 17:41.337
I'm moving in.

17:41.404 --> 17:43.594
Also I need to get on your gym
membership,

17:43.714 --> 17:46.375
because I got to get back in there ASAP
before I lose this pump.

17:46.812 --> 17:48.450
What's with the beers?
Are you carbo loading?

17:49.112 --> 17:49.945
No. (gagging)

17:50.013 --> 17:51.531
Oh. What are you doing?

17:51.651 --> 17:52.511
Are you going to throw up?

17:52.631 --> 17:53.949
No...
Then why are you gagging?

17:54.017 --> 17:56.252
Oh, that... Because, Dee,
that triggers my gag reflex

17:56.319 --> 17:58.420
too, and then I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

17:58.488 --> 17:59.255
It's fine.

17:59.322 --> 18:00.890
I had some bad spaghetti.

18:03.026 --> 18:06.762
Dee, look, the point is... the
reason I came over here is

18:06.830 --> 18:09.199
because you were totally right
about this marriage thing, okay?

18:09.319 --> 18:11.710
It is a special bond between
two people in love.

18:12.116 --> 18:13.302
And everybody deserves...

18:13.370 --> 18:14.069
...that right.

18:14.137 --> 18:17.773
Look, I'm thinking that...
I got to throw up. I'm gonna throw up.

18:17.841 --> 18:20.109
No, no, no, no, not in there.

18:20.503 --> 18:25.138
Oh, sorry. Uh...
Wait. I know you.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.617
Bill Ponderosa.

18:35.330 --> 18:37.206
Where are you going?

18:37.861 --> 18:40.896
Hey, Maureen Ponder...
Hey.

18:40.964 --> 18:43.265
I was just going to go
meet up with the guys.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.267
But I thought we were going
to watch a movie tonight.

18:45.335 --> 18:47.009
Watch a movie... yes, we were.

18:47.129 --> 18:50.139
Yeah, you know what... but I feel the
need to reconnect with the guys.

18:50.207 --> 18:52.631
So... But you know what, you
can watch a movie without me.

18:52.751 --> 18:54.157
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:54.277 --> 18:57.246
Dude, we have so many
great, great movies here.

18:57.314 --> 18:59.548
Got a lot of action films
which is very, very exciting.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.689
Got all the Lethal Weapon
movies, which is cool.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.422
Including the one that I made
with the guys... Lethal Weapon 5.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.470
Yes. Amazing film, truly, truly.

19:06.590 --> 19:08.624
Although it gets a little
confusing halfway through

19:08.692 --> 19:10.693
because Mac and I decided
to switch parts.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.828
He wanted to play Murtaugh
for some reason.

19:12.896 --> 19:14.006
Yeah, and I'm not going to lie.

19:14.126 --> 19:15.931
His use of blackface I found
a bit regrettable, but...

19:15.999 --> 19:18.535
Come on, it's our first
night as a married couple.

19:18.787 --> 19:20.469
I want to spend it
with my husband.

19:20.537 --> 19:22.232
Oh, yeah.

19:22.947 --> 19:26.422
I see that you're wearing
another one of those kitty cat

19:26.542 --> 19:28.984
sweatshirts that you seem so fond of.

19:29.104 --> 19:32.347
And you glued some jewels and
some flowers and things to it.

19:32.356 --> 19:33.415
- Uh-huh.
- Interesting.

19:33.483 --> 19:35.251
I like to be comfy and current.

19:35.318 --> 19:37.043
Yeah, yeah.

19:37.163 --> 19:38.731
I did not remember
that about you.

19:38.851 --> 19:41.156
You don't remember a
lot of things, silly.

19:42.021 --> 19:42.867
Yeah.

19:42.987 --> 19:44.848
Now you get yourself
on that couch.

19:44.968 --> 19:46.435
I'm gonna go make
us fish sticks.

19:46.555 --> 19:49.346
Uh, I don't... I don't think
we have any fish sticks.

19:49.466 --> 19:50.866
I bought some.

19:50.934 --> 19:54.103
- Yeah. I don't particularly like
fish sticks, but... - Dennis.

19:54.170 --> 19:57.547
- Hmm?
- Hey, I love you.

20:04.214 --> 20:07.182
Uh, I love you.

20:18.387 --> 20:19.871
Yeah.
