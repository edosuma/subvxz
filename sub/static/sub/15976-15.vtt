You made a 50-year-old jingle

00:24.616 --> 00:26.032
sound like a Gold Record.

00:26.034 --> 00:27.617
I actually have a Gold Record.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.719
- Have two Platinums.
- Grammy.

00:29.721 --> 00:30.953
- Dad?
- Honey...

00:30.955 --> 00:32.354
we just laid down
the track and it was perfect.

00:32.356 --> 00:34.790
All before Doris Jingle-Writer
even got here.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.826
- Yeah, Conrad's not gonna make it.
- It's a bummer, honey,

00:36.828 --> 00:38.294
I'm gonna miss his cheerleading.

00:38.296 --> 00:40.379
"It's not a jingle,
you buffoon, it's a journey,

00:40.381 --> 00:43.215
and your singers are taking us on
a detour through Crapasylvakia."

00:43.217 --> 00:44.333
Dad, he's dead.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.802
He died in his sleep
last night.

00:46.804 --> 00:48.137
Melora's in your office.

00:48.139 --> 00:50.456
- Oh.
- Wow.

00:50.458 --> 00:51.757
He went quick.

00:51.759 --> 00:53.375
It was a blessing, I suppose.

00:53.377 --> 00:55.061
Certainly for all those
who knew him.

00:55.063 --> 00:58.564
Save for me, of course.
I'm wrought.

00:58.566 --> 01:01.901
- How did he go?
- The doctors think it was his heart.

01:01.903 --> 01:04.620
Ironic, considering how
little mileage he put on it.

01:06.957 --> 01:08.374
Are you okay?

01:08.376 --> 01:10.242
Yes. Looking at you now,

01:10.244 --> 01:13.329
I suddenly remembered how much
my father disliked short people.

01:13.331 --> 01:16.048
He had faults.
They were many.

01:16.050 --> 01:17.617
Would you do his eulogy?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.164
- Say what?
- I know, it's a challenge.

01:19.181 --> 01:21.591
People didn't like him
Nor did his pet.

01:21.616 --> 01:24.423
But I knew him better
than anyone in the world, and...

01:24.425 --> 01:26.542
his life deserves
to be celebrated.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.477
By me.
You want me to eulogize,

01:28.479 --> 01:30.146
uh, like, as in...

01:30.148 --> 01:32.298
"Alas, poor Conrad, I..."
Well, no...

01:32.300 --> 01:33.516
What about your mother?

01:33.518 --> 01:35.768
Or your stepmother?
Or any one of your stepmothers.

01:35.770 --> 01:36.886
All tickled he's dead.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.888
- Aha.
- Isn't there any other family?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.139
Just my godfather...

01:40.141 --> 01:41.524
- Perfect.
- ...which is you.

01:41.526 --> 01:44.226
No, no, what, no,
I'm... I'm not... no...

01:44.228 --> 01:46.312
That's for real?
I thought he was joking.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.430
I'd eulogize him myself if I thought
I could hold myself together

01:48.432 --> 01:50.733
but as you can see,
I am a basket case.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.436
Honey, I can assure you
your father would not want me

01:53.438 --> 01:54.537
to speak at his funeral.

01:54.539 --> 01:56.288
The only thing he could
ever say about me was

01:56.290 --> 01:58.541
"Simon Roberts is
an untalented hack."

01:58.543 --> 02:00.543
And he always made
the "hack" noise. It was ugly.

02:00.545 --> 02:02.461
Do you know what he told me
about you, Simon?

02:02.463 --> 02:05.281
He said you get
the song in life.

02:05.283 --> 02:08.084
- He said that about me? - That you
had a way of making people feel

02:08.086 --> 02:09.502
invited to the dance.

02:09.503 --> 02:12.388
- I remember he hated dancing.
- And music. And people.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.639
And feet.

02:13.641 --> 02:16.976
Wait, how could he hate music?
He wrote jingles.

02:16.978 --> 02:19.512
Happy jingles, jingles
that snap, crackled and popped.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.347
I truly think
there was a happy man

02:21.349 --> 02:23.683
deep, deep, <i>deep</i> down there,

02:23.685 --> 02:25.401
looking to get out.

02:25.403 --> 02:26.469
He never did.

02:26.471 --> 02:29.071
- Never. - I want his life
to be celebrated,

02:29.073 --> 02:31.273
at least for one day.
Please, Simon.

02:31.275 --> 02:32.608
- Mm-hmm.
- He was my father.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.026
- No, no, Melora...
- Wait for it.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.411
For what?

02:37.914 --> 02:39.248
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.750
As godfather,

02:40.752 --> 02:43.285
I'll do what I can, Connie.

02:43.287 --> 02:47.006
If he sleeps with the fishes,
I'll make sure he sleeps well.

of softness.

03:08.846 --> 03:10.896
Paws off, pal.

03:10.898 --> 03:12.648
Just one squeeze?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.867
Just enjoy it with your eyes.

03:17.037 --> 03:18.404
Please tell me what you saw.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.623
Tell you what we saw?
Tell me what you saw.

03:20.625 --> 03:24.126
Well, I saw two bears,
very evolved.

03:24.128 --> 03:26.996
I might add most just go in
the woods, and don't use...

03:26.998 --> 03:28.681
Even Yogi, who was smarter
than the average bear...

03:28.683 --> 03:29.832
You. What's your name?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.967
Still Lauren.
What'd you see?

03:31.969 --> 03:34.303
Well, mama bear, papa bear...

03:34.305 --> 03:35.671
Exactly. Yes.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.223
Mama bear, papa bear,
where's the baby bear?

03:37.225 --> 03:39.208
Why no baby bear?
Tell me. You.

03:39.210 --> 03:43.245
Well, uh, maybe baby bear is either
still in Huggies, or... Bad answer.

03:43.247 --> 03:45.281
Did not please me. Bad answer.
Got it.

03:45.283 --> 03:46.766
I want a baby bear.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.685
And I want it... to be pink.
Hm?

03:49.687 --> 03:51.137
A pink baby.
They shouldn't all be blue.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.488
He got the diversity memo.

03:52.490 --> 03:54.406
And I want to do another spot
without any bears at all,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.742
but with people...
real human beings people.

03:56.744 --> 03:58.961
Brilliant.
Should we first test it

03:58.963 --> 03:59.879
with non-human beings people?

03:59.881 --> 04:01.197
Real human beings people.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.565
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.116
Sweet human being
mother of softness

04:04.118 --> 04:07.269
with human being, sexy people.

04:07.271 --> 04:08.704
Like you. Like you.
Not you.

04:10.123 --> 04:11.207
- It's lunacy.
- Why?

04:11.209 --> 04:12.374
It worked for bears,
why shouldn't it

04:12.376 --> 04:14.376
work for people, like
the real human being kind?

04:14.378 --> 04:15.410
It shouldn't have
worked for bears.

04:15.412 --> 04:17.079
Bears go in the woods.
Hey, Simon,

04:17.081 --> 04:18.898
uh, I'm so sorry,
I'm having a little trouble

04:18.899 --> 04:20.332
with the Charmin account.

04:20.334 --> 04:21.966
Really?
Want to trade projects?

04:21.969 --> 04:24.253
Deal. What do I got? A dead
masochistic jingle writer.

04:24.255 --> 04:26.188
You're doing the eulogy. No, no, listen.
Wait, wait, wait.

04:26.190 --> 04:28.541
Toilet paper for Conrad?
Trust me, it's an even swap.

04:28.543 --> 04:31.126
What's an even swap?
Oh, Melora. This is Andrew.

04:31.128 --> 04:33.145
He'll be doing
your dad's eulogy.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.697
He is our go-to
vulnerability guy.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.031
Did he know my father?
Not at all.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.616
Which gives him
a leg up, really.

04:37.618 --> 04:40.152
But I want you to do it. But no one
evokes sympathy more than Andrew.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.321
I mean, look at that face.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.174
He's like a poster child for sad.
I don't want sad.

04:45.176 --> 04:46.575
I want pomp,
I want circumstance.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.777
I want my father
celebrated and rebranded...

04:48.779 --> 04:50.779
- Andrew can do...
- ...as beloved.

04:50.781 --> 04:52.014
I'm sorry, did you say beloved?

04:52.016 --> 04:53.115
Yes, beloved.

04:53.117 --> 04:54.550
Honey, I'm good,
but not that good.

04:54.552 --> 04:56.118
Yes, you are.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.686
This is my father
we're talking about.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.555
He wrote so many
jingles for you.

04:59.557 --> 05:01.090
You knew him.
There was a rumor

05:01.092 --> 05:02.708
you once liked him some.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.059
Wait for it, here it comes.

05:04.061 --> 05:06.011
Melora, look...
Oh, God, oh, God.

05:06.013 --> 05:07.446
Oh, <i>wow.</i>

05:07.448 --> 05:08.480
It's like a lip seizure.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.316
Oh... Ooh, it's
a-ripplating, up and down.

05:10.318 --> 05:12.368
Look at that lip quiver. Just,
tick-a, tick-a, tick-a, tick-a...

05:12.370 --> 05:15.104
Oh, God, oh, God, just...
Stop, stop it.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.406
Okay, okay, I said
I'll do it; I'll do it.

05:17.408 --> 05:18.974
And I want it to be kick-ass.

05:18.976 --> 05:22.077
Pomp, circumstance. It'll be the
most kick-ass funeral ever.

05:22.079 --> 05:24.580
By the time you're finished,
I want him unrecognizable.

05:24.582 --> 05:26.031
I'm gonna give that
miserable son of a bitch

05:26.033 --> 05:27.216
the best damn funeral
he doesn't deserve.

05:27.218 --> 05:28.417
Yay, dead guy!

05:29.252 --> 05:30.819
Okay. Just a little too soon.

05:30.821 --> 05:31.987
Oh, yeah.

05:31.989 --> 05:34.290
- That felt wrong.
- Yeah, a little respect.

05:40.205 --> 05:42.557
Before we even resume...

05:42.559 --> 05:44.609
who's dead?

05:44.611 --> 05:45.710
I'm sorry?

05:45.712 --> 05:47.261
Don't play dumb
with me, scarecrow.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.629
Somebody around here croaked.

05:48.631 --> 05:49.831
It wasn't the Budweiser Frog.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.699
You people are pitching some
big funeral campaign.

05:51.701 --> 05:52.867
We want in on that.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.936
- You want in on a funeral?
- Oh, you betcha.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.854
I am sick of getting
our asses wiped by Kleenex

05:56.856 --> 05:59.157
in the ancillary markets.
There is no reason

05:59.159 --> 06:01.259
people can't be drying
their eyes with Charmin.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.528
Well, first, this figures
to be a tear-free funeral.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.813
I don't care.
And second,

06:05.815 --> 06:07.832
since Kleenex has
respectfully stayed out

06:07.834 --> 06:09.517
of the bottom hygiene market...

06:09.519 --> 06:11.035
I don't like you. since Kleenex
has Now that's official. out

06:11.037 --> 06:12.170
If people are crying

06:12.172 --> 06:13.638
at a Lewis, Roberts & Roberts
sponsored event,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.224
I damn well want to see rolls
of Charmin being passed around.

06:16.226 --> 06:17.675
Do I make myself clear?

06:17.677 --> 06:19.210
Shouldn't we be getting back

06:19.212 --> 06:20.461
to the sweet, yummy...

06:20.463 --> 06:22.430
No.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.599
Right now my focus
is on off-label usage.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.317
I want what Kleenex has.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.052
People need to wipe
their glasses?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.020
Why not Charmin?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.988
Blow your nose?
Why not Charmin?

06:30.990 --> 06:33.224
Remove a little makeup.
Why not Charmin?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.826
Stuff your bra before the prom.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.060
Why not Charmin?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.228
Why not...

06:37.230 --> 06:39.280
Charmin?

06:40.115 --> 06:41.749
I just did a first pass
at the eulogy.

06:41.751 --> 06:44.068
I'll test it with a focus group,
see if it needs any punch-up.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.453
Our social media campaign
is on fire.

06:45.455 --> 06:47.505
His death notice has gotten tons
of "Likes" on the Facebook page.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.173
Yeah, we hired a rocking choir
for the church.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.574
It'll be so fun,
people will say

06:50.576 --> 06:52.026
why couldn't he have
died years ago?

06:52.028 --> 06:53.344
Sounds fantastic.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.679
Totally.
Like with any campaign,

06:54.681 --> 06:55.963
it's very important we get
to know the product first.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.081
In this case...

06:57.083 --> 06:58.850
The man. Yeah, the man.
The man. Who da man?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.268
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Who dat? Who dat?

07:00.270 --> 07:01.519
Oh, this is so much fun.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.254
We'll put the "fun" in
"funeral." Uh, okay.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.289
Let's talk about some of the
things that he did. Mm-hmm.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.191
And who he did them to?
Nice things.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.659
Like, was he involved
in any charities?

07:08.661 --> 07:10.978
He sued the March of Dimes once.
Oh. Excellent.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.497
"Active
in philanthropic community."

07:12.499 --> 07:13.331
What were his loves?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.515
Uh...

07:14.517 --> 07:15.700
Hates?

07:15.702 --> 07:17.368
Flowers, puppies,
birds chirping.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.669
Okay. Maybe we should go
to the box.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.321
Okay. These are
the family photos?

07:20.323 --> 07:22.907
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I picked out
my father's happiest moments.

07:22.909 --> 07:23.908
Oh, wonderful.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.609
Oh. Wow.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.028
He's not smiling
in any of these.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.213
He also hated smiles.
We should add that to the list.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.299
Against smiles... good. Well,
this should be a piece of cake.

07:31.301 --> 07:33.050
And cake. Hated cake.
Sorry.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.837
Syd, we just got a call from
Payson's bosses at Charmin.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.305
Is there a problem?

07:37.307 --> 07:38.890
Well...

07:38.892 --> 07:41.058
Am I right? Am I right?

07:41.060 --> 07:42.376
It looks right.
People get nosebleeds

07:42.378 --> 07:44.228
a lot, especially kids.
They get 'em all the time.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.881
They stuff 'em with cotton.
Well, why... not...

07:46.883 --> 07:48.465
Charmin! Charmin? Andrew, Zach,

07:48.467 --> 07:49.984
may I borrow you guys
for a second?

07:49.986 --> 07:51.669
Sorry, Mitchell.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.104
Of course. Go ahead.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.572
I'm only the client.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.609
So, we just got a call

07:58.611 --> 08:00.978
from Charmin. It seems our exec
has gone a bit rogue.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.980
Mmm. Evidently, his wife
left him yesterday.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.715
Has he been
acting strange at all?

08:04.717 --> 08:06.650
No. Seems fine.
Not at all.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.921
Okay, well, we're told he no
longer speaks for the company,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.973
so you guys are gonna have
to terminate the meeting.

08:11.975 --> 08:14.292
Ooh, who's gonna break that ns?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.459
Um...

08:15.461 --> 08:17.178
Gosh, I'm terrible
at confrontation,

08:17.180 --> 08:19.180
and don't argue with me about it
because I'm gonna lose.

08:19.182 --> 08:20.664
And I'm not good
at telling people things

08:20.666 --> 08:21.682
they don't want to hear.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.618
In fact, I don't
even believe in that.

08:25.053 --> 08:26.604
Fine, ladies.

08:29.491 --> 08:31.526
Mitchell.

08:31.528 --> 08:34.162
Hey... You're outside
on a baking hot day.

08:34.164 --> 08:37.131
You forgot your sunscreen.
Why not Charmin?

08:37.133 --> 08:41.485
Mitchell, I've been notified
by your superiors

08:41.486 --> 08:43.453
to terminate this meeting.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.357
They say that you've been
a bit erratic.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.858
Why did they say that?

08:47.860 --> 08:51.195
I know that your wife left you.
I-I'm sure this is a very

08:51.197 --> 08:53.581
difficult time. I certainly see no
reason to bring my personal life

08:53.583 --> 08:55.466
into this. We are professionals.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.667
Uh, Mitchell...

08:56.669 --> 08:58.002
I would like a moment, please.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.036
Uh, of course.
If there's anything...

08:59.038 --> 09:00.371
I would like a moment.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.123
You got it.

09:04.359 --> 09:06.677
Overall, the test audience
really liked the eulogy.

09:06.679 --> 09:07.595
Oh, good.
Yeah.

09:07.597 --> 09:09.630
But not Conrad.
Ah.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.732
Only 23% of respondents say
they would have dinner with him,

09:11.734 --> 09:13.484
were he... alive.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.602
Well, that's not terrible.

09:14.604 --> 09:15.770
More than he had
when he was alive.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.272
Yeah, but usually,
there's a postmortem swell.

09:18.274 --> 09:19.840
You're forgetting
about the death bounce.

09:19.842 --> 09:20.908
What do I have to do?

09:20.910 --> 09:22.577
Well, get some corroboration,
for starters.

09:22.579 --> 09:24.395
Studies suggest that people
need to hear something

09:24.397 --> 09:26.280
from two separate sources...

09:26.282 --> 09:28.899
or Morgan Freeman... before
it becomes an inherent truth.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.586
- Can we get Morgan Freeman?
- No, but we can get Fred Melamed.

09:31.588 --> 09:33.454
Mr. Voiceover.
He's in the building laying down

09:33.456 --> 09:36.173
a track for La-Z-Boy. Go tell
him to get his lazy boy ass

09:36.175 --> 09:38.125
up here ASPCA. He loves animals.

09:38.127 --> 09:39.794
He'll do it for the beast
known as Conrad.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.078
Call him.
Tell him it's urgent.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.080
If Fred says it, it is so.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.933
Hey, Dad. Little... situation.

09:45.935 --> 09:47.184
What now?

09:52.774 --> 09:53.924
Mitchell.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.726
Simon. Family good?

09:55.728 --> 09:58.112
Can't complain. You're naked.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.730
Fantastic, isn't it?

09:59.732 --> 10:01.499
Really good. Amazing.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.451
I've decided to shed my
clothes, if not my skin.

10:03.453 --> 10:06.320
I have come to the do-over
fork in life's road, Simon.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.122
After you're done
rebranding the dead guy,

10:08.124 --> 10:09.824
I'd like you to remake me. Well,

10:09.826 --> 10:11.409
Mitchell, I...
I want...

10:11.411 --> 10:12.943
I want to be noticed.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.045
I'd say mission accomplished.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.463
The meek do not inherit.
That's a big lie.

10:15.465 --> 10:16.797
You know that, don't you?

10:16.799 --> 10:18.032
I do now.
It's the noisy

10:18.034 --> 10:19.917
who prosper, the ones who draw
attention to themselves.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.419
I don't have to tell you.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.754
You splatter yourself
on the wall,

10:23.756 --> 10:26.240
paint this bigger-than-life
perception and it works,

10:26.242 --> 10:27.541
doesn't it?

10:27.543 --> 10:28.726
There you are.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.627
Maybe we should talk
about this in my office.

10:30.629 --> 10:31.795
Like the Old Spice guy.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.763
I'm on a horse,
you're on a wall.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.298
The elevator, no less.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.567
The ups and downs of life.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.135
Mitchell... Well, it's
my turn, damn it.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.538
I want to be on a horse,
I want to be on a wa.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.075
It is my turn
to be somebody I'm not.

10:45.327 --> 10:48.396
"In
a world..." Fred...

10:48.398 --> 10:49.480
my office.

10:50.815 --> 10:52.750
Deal with this.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.152
Really? I'm such a non-nude kind of guy.
Deal with it.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.672
Hey... Mitchell. Do you want

10:57.674 --> 10:58.789
to head into the...
No.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.957
Okay. How 'bout an extra layer?

10:59.959 --> 11:01.992
No.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.128
I want to be someone I'm not.

11:05.797 --> 11:07.164
Quackenbush.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.432
Know what I'm talking about?

11:08.434 --> 11:10.584
Not a clue.
Exactly. Uh,

11:10.586 --> 11:12.353
if I were to walk up to a
stranger on the street and say

11:12.355 --> 11:14.939
"Quackenbush,"
they'd give me exactly the...

11:14.941 --> 11:16.207
stare I'm seeing now.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.908
But if I were to say "Charmin,"

11:17.910 --> 11:19.643
that shouts something.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.613
It shouts, "World's softest
bathroom tissue,

11:22.615 --> 11:25.149
ultra soft,
ultra strong."

11:25.151 --> 11:26.450
And that is a product

11:26.452 --> 11:28.769
you helped bring
to mankind, Mitchell.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.671
And with it,
its underlying message:

11:30.673 --> 11:32.456
"Enjoy the go."

11:32.458 --> 11:34.625
Think about that.
Finally,

11:34.627 --> 11:37.812
just... enjoying the go.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.300
Are you out
of your dinky little mind?

11:43.302 --> 11:44.201
Come on, you're a voiceover guy.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.469
Anything you say
will sound good.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.420
Yeah. Syphilis.

11:46.422 --> 11:47.505
Ah, it's like music.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.206
Fred, just a few kind words.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.426
Sure, $10,000. To say something nice
about a guy at his own funeral?

11:52.428 --> 11:54.478
Simon, is this not
the height of phonyism?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.763
No, I'm taking it
to a new height.

11:55.765 --> 11:56.831
Well, well, well.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.215
Hello.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.651
Fred, this is
Conrad's daughter Melora.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.803
"In a dark and empty cavern
of despair,

12:02.805 --> 12:04.238
"one man stood alone

12:04.240 --> 12:06.240
"like a mountain,
waiting to be scaled

12:06.242 --> 12:08.843
by the weak and vulnerable."

12:08.845 --> 12:10.244
Does that actually work?

12:10.246 --> 12:11.662
Oh, you have no idea.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.614
So, it'll be cash or check.
I don't take credit cards.

12:13.616 --> 12:14.832
Wear the ascot.
Why?

12:14.834 --> 12:16.167
Why does anyone wear an ascot?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.269
So, how we doing?
Well, as assignments go...

12:18.271 --> 12:20.287
I really don't care
if you just make it up, Simon.

12:20.289 --> 12:21.672
That's fine. Well,
sweetheart, listen,

12:21.674 --> 12:23.124
in advertising,
a hack starts with a lie

12:23.126 --> 12:25.760
and then builds the ad. A good
adman starts with the truth

12:25.762 --> 12:27.911
and then builds to the lie.
So if you dig somewhere

12:27.913 --> 12:29.597
deep down there,
there's still a kernel of truth.

12:29.599 --> 12:31.515
But the deeper I dig
with your dad,

12:31.517 --> 12:34.885
it's just...
No, don't...

12:34.887 --> 12:37.855
You're talking about a
man I loved very much.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.256
I know, but... Just
give me a spectacle,

12:39.258 --> 12:40.757
Simon. That's all I ask.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.310
Whether it's a lie or...
I just want a spectacle.

12:43.312 --> 12:45.146
For once, I want my father

12:45.148 --> 12:47.648
in the same room
as the word "wow."

12:51.453 --> 12:53.988
Wow.

12:58.557 --> 13:00.941
- On a scale of one to ten...
- General Patton.

13:00.943 --> 13:03.494
- Oh, God.
- Over and over.

13:03.496 --> 13:05.963
Remember, no bastard ever won
a war by dying for his country.

13:05.965 --> 13:07.348
He won the war by making

13:07.350 --> 13:09.834
some other poor dumb bastard
die for his country.

13:09.836 --> 13:12.370
Hey, honey. I love the smell
of Patton in the morning.

13:12.372 --> 13:13.671
Dad?

13:13.673 --> 13:14.739
You know I'm just getting
fired up, you know.

13:14.741 --> 13:16.140
Big speech,
got to get in the zone,

13:16.142 --> 13:17.942
be uplifting, inspiring.

13:17.944 --> 13:19.143
Salvation time.

13:19.145 --> 13:21.229
Are you really nervous
about this?

13:21.231 --> 13:23.648
I mean, you're a showman.
What's the big deal?

13:23.650 --> 13:24.965
Um...

13:24.967 --> 13:26.768
You want to talk?

13:26.770 --> 13:28.319
Yeah.

13:28.321 --> 13:30.488
Let's sit down.

13:35.694 --> 13:37.978
You know, when I'm
selling a product,

13:37.980 --> 13:40.998
whether it's Pringles, laxatives
or erectile dysfunction,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.785
you know what I'm
really selling?

13:43.787 --> 13:46.104
Myself. My personality.

13:46.106 --> 13:47.338
All my nonsense and...

13:47.340 --> 13:49.357
Yeah, which you're full of,
so what's the problem?

13:49.359 --> 13:51.726
Well, I always believed
in myself.

13:51.728 --> 13:53.678
Meaning?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.162
Meaning that maybe
there was some naked truth

13:55.164 --> 13:57.098
in what naked Mitchell said.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.500
I am this big artifice
of perception.

13:59.502 --> 14:02.937
They throw a bigger-than-life
image of myself on that wall,

14:02.939 --> 14:04.389
and people end up buying it.

14:04.391 --> 14:05.623
What are they buying really?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.443
Do you really feel this way?

14:08.445 --> 14:09.610
I don't know.
You know,

14:09.612 --> 14:11.446
funerals force a man
to ponder his legacy.

14:11.448 --> 14:13.948
And what's mine, really?

14:13.950 --> 14:15.683
I'm good at selling crap.

14:15.685 --> 14:17.535
Wow. Stop the presses.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.404
Daddy...

14:19.406 --> 14:22.623
You always say that
when you know I need it.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.692
Come on.

14:24.694 --> 14:27.245
You remember the old David
Ogilvy story? Yeah.

14:27.247 --> 14:29.530
Blind man, it's springtime,
and I cannot see?

14:29.532 --> 14:30.848
Yeah, something like that.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.884
Yeah, well, with you,
it's not just

14:32.886 --> 14:34.469
that it's always springtime.

14:34.471 --> 14:37.789
You have a way of making
everyone else see it, too.

14:37.791 --> 14:40.374
You're not really worried
about your legacy, are you?

14:40.376 --> 14:42.026
Smoke and mirrors, baby.

14:42.028 --> 14:43.711
No.

14:43.713 --> 14:45.813
You're awesome.

14:45.815 --> 14:48.215
And you don't need to sell that.

14:48.217 --> 14:49.600
Now, come on!

14:49.602 --> 14:51.602
Right. We have a kick-ass
funeral to throw.

14:51.604 --> 14:53.821
Yeah. Let's do this.

I... I just didn't
want to be alone.

15:26.856 --> 15:31.476
Plus, there's something oddly
affirmative about you people.

17:24.807 --> 17:26.807
What can you say about Conrad?

17:26.809 --> 17:28.541
Conrad.

17:28.544 --> 17:31.479
He was a lot of
things to a few people.

17:31.481 --> 17:34.649
He was a loud man
with strong opinions.

17:34.651 --> 17:36.734
Although I didn't
find him attractive,

17:36.736 --> 17:38.653
many of our wives did.

17:38.655 --> 17:41.639
He was a good Jew...
and even better anti-Semite.

17:41.641 --> 17:43.207
But I never judged,

17:43.209 --> 17:45.693
'cause I thought
he had inside information.

17:45.695 --> 17:48.079
Information... there's
so much of it out there.

17:48.081 --> 17:50.514
Everyone Twittering
and Twerking

17:50.516 --> 17:51.699
and rehashtagging.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.250
How much
of that information is true?

17:53.252 --> 17:55.653
How much of what I'm saying
about Conrad is really true?

17:55.655 --> 17:57.288
None of us really knew him.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.874
Except his daughter.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.576
Melora.

18:02.578 --> 18:05.796
You wanted me
to sell your father as beloved.

18:05.798 --> 18:07.882
Well, he was beloved, honey,
by you.

18:07.884 --> 18:12.086
No matter who Conrad
was, or what he did,

18:12.088 --> 18:13.587
you loved him.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.396

through his daughter's eyes.

18:22.398 --> 18:25.449
That's his legacy.

18:25.451 --> 18:27.284
To be deeply loved,
if not widely.

18:27.286 --> 18:29.954
Truly loved by the one person

18:49.841 --> 18:53.644

to see the face of God.
