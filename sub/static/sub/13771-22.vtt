HAL: Oh, geez...

00:03.699 --> 00:06.441
Oh... hey, can one
of you boys give me a hand?

00:06.528 --> 00:08.704
-What do you need?
-Just hold this steady.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.358
Thanks, Malcolm.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.489
I'm glad it's you.

00:11.576 --> 00:12.838
Whenever Reese helps,

00:12.925 --> 00:14.753
he always seems
to hurt himself.

"Mother's wonderful,
quiet dignity." [laughing]

00:59.581 --> 01:02.540
No, her "sensitive,
quiet dignity."

01:02.627 --> 01:05.065
-[laughter]
-What are you guys doing?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.805
We were at the mall,

01:06.892 --> 01:09.678
and they had these entry forms
for the Mrs. Tri-County contest.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.288
Look at these questions.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.986
"How does your mother
bring joy into your life?"

01:14.074 --> 01:15.379
-[laughing]
-How about the time

01:15.466 --> 01:17.468
she shaved the word "liar"
into my head?

01:17.555 --> 01:22.082
"She always finds time to dote
on our personal appearance."

01:22.169 --> 01:23.648
[roaring laughter]

01:23.735 --> 01:25.476
What's so funny?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.522
Uh...

01:27.609 --> 01:29.263
Reese saw a Japanese guy
on the Internet

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
puke into an electric fan.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.267
They are ahead of us
in so many ways.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.053
[cackling]

01:39.795 --> 01:40.665
HAL: All right...

01:40.752 --> 01:42.189
how bad is it?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.886
Nothing past
second notice so far.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.192
Oh...

01:47.150 --> 01:48.108
What's that?

01:48.195 --> 01:49.457
Apparently I've been entered

01:49.544 --> 01:52.286
into the Mrs. Tri-County
Pageant.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.026
-What?
-The boys entered me

01:54.114 --> 01:55.506
in this pageant.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.510
"...lucky to have her
in our lives."

01:59.597 --> 02:02.165
"Too special to be
kept a secret..."

02:02.252 --> 02:03.949
"She suffers in silence"?

02:04.036 --> 02:05.560
Oh, can you believe this?

02:05.647 --> 02:06.952
I know. They do all
these horrible things

02:07.039 --> 02:08.084
and then they go and do

02:08.170 --> 02:10.042
something like this.

02:11.609 --> 02:15.222
Yes, well,
they're good boys.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.528
God, I think of suffering
through all those pageants,

02:17.615 --> 02:19.487
slaving for my sister
all those years.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.097
Susan was always
the big star,

02:21.184 --> 02:23.099
and I was her
invisible little troll--

02:23.186 --> 02:26.233
carrying her gowns for
Queen of Harvest Festival,

02:26.320 --> 02:28.931
ironing her sash
for Miss Mammogram.

02:29.018 --> 02:32.064
Well, no one ever appreciates
the star maker, Lois.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.805
Once I was hemming her dress
for Dairy Princess,

02:33.892 --> 02:36.721
and a photographer stood on
my back to take her picture.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.289
Bastards wouldn't
know a Dairy Princess

02:39.376 --> 02:41.204
if it came up and
bit them on the ass.

02:42.466 --> 02:45.774
Boy, it would really show her
if I entered this pageant.

02:45.861 --> 02:46.992
[chuckles]

02:47.079 --> 02:48.429
What?

02:48.516 --> 02:49.691
Well, it wouldn't hurt
to go down there and see

02:49.778 --> 02:51.171
what it's all about.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.566
Great. Let's do it.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.742
You little monsters!

02:57.829 --> 02:59.483
You have really
done it this time!

02:59.570 --> 03:00.876
Dad, it was a joke.
I didn't know Reese

03:00.963 --> 03:02.225
was going to mail
the stupid thing.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.618
We were just goofing around.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.446
I can't believe
she took it seriously.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.056
You're right, Dewey.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.014
Your mother actually
believes her sons love her.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.973
What a moron.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.584
I've got it: Why don't you
just blindfold your mother

03:13.671 --> 03:15.151
and throw her down some stairs?!

03:15.238 --> 03:16.587
That'd be fun!

03:16.674 --> 03:18.285
We're sorry.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.547
Yeah.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.939
Well, it's too late
for "sorry."

03:21.026 --> 03:22.680
Here's what's
going to happen:

03:22.767 --> 03:24.943
We are all going down to the
Civic Center as a family,

03:25.030 --> 03:27.207
and you boys are going to
do everything in your power

03:27.294 --> 03:29.600
to make sure this is the
most unhumiliating night

03:29.687 --> 03:30.558
of your mother's life.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.170
LOIS: Wow!

03:34.257 --> 03:36.172
This is a big deal.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.782
I have to be honest,
I'm feeling

03:37.869 --> 03:39.044
-kind of nervous here.
-Aww...

03:39.131 --> 03:40.698
HERKABE:
You don't pay mileage,

03:40.785 --> 03:42.091
I had to park
in the structure,

03:42.178 --> 03:43.701
and you call this
a gift bag?

03:43.788 --> 03:46.138
I saw two judges with
the mini-lipstick set

03:46.226 --> 03:48.010
and the lemon-scented
moisturizer!

03:48.097 --> 03:49.577
Mr. Herkabe,
what are you doing here?

03:49.664 --> 03:51.274
I happen to be
one of the judges.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.580
What, may I ask,
are you doing here?

03:52.667 --> 03:55.365
You know, curiosity.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.888
It's kind of a sociologically
interesting...

03:56.975 --> 03:59.456
My God, your mother's
in the pageant.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.980
Well, technically.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.853
Hmm. And I happen to
have certain powers

04:04.940 --> 04:06.550
that might influence
that outcome.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.552
Isn't that interesting?
What?

04:08.639 --> 04:09.814
No, I just think that's
really interesting.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.294
Don't you find it
interesting?

04:11.381 --> 04:13.209
Yeah, I guess
I'm gonna have to.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.776
I'm sorry, sir. They were
out of the moisturizer,

04:14.863 --> 04:16.517
but I found these.

04:16.603 --> 04:19.084
Fine. I'll take the smoked
almonds, the loofah glove...

04:19.171 --> 04:20.434
Oh, just give me the whole box.

04:21.783 --> 04:22.871
[rattling]

04:22.958 --> 04:24.742
[giggling]

04:24.829 --> 04:26.266
All right, ladies, sign in.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.441
You'll get your schedules,

04:27.528 --> 04:28.833
your parking permits,

04:28.920 --> 04:30.835
and your dressing area
assignment.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.751
Also, make sure that you
get back here by 3:00 sharp

04:33.838 --> 04:36.319
for a group photo with
the state's largest pumpkin.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.626
[indistinct chattering]

04:40.105 --> 04:41.846
Look at all these old broads
trying to look hot.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.935
I mean, don't know they know
we're done with them?

04:44.936 --> 04:47.635
Donna? Donna, is that you?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
Lois!

04:49.376 --> 04:52.292
I haven't seen you since
Miss Teen Gas and Power.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.902
What a memory you have.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.643
Was that the time
when the judges

04:55.730 --> 04:57.558
carried me around
on their shoulders?

04:57.645 --> 04:58.950
[chuckling]

04:59.037 --> 05:00.648
Darlene, Jeanie, Anne.
Look who's here.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.953
ALL: Hi.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.477
Look at all of you.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.869
I can't believe you're
still doing pageants.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.523
Well, I actually quit
a few years back.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.916
It was time to get to know
my kids a little better.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.572
But then September 11th
happened, and...

05:11.659 --> 05:13.965
We just can't
let them win.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.576
So where's your sister?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.360
Uh, Susan isn't here.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.188
I'm entering this myself.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.018
Oh.

05:23.105 --> 05:26.500
-I love stuff like that.
-Don't feel bad.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.545
The rest of us don't
have a chance either.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.852
Donna somehow
got Nina Perucci to coach her.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.028
Nina Perucci!

05:33.115 --> 05:34.551
How did you manage that?

05:34.638 --> 05:37.467
Well, Max got a nice bonus
for Christmas,

05:37.554 --> 05:39.730
and let's just say
I had a yeast infection

05:39.817 --> 05:41.253
until he wrote the check.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.603
[women giggling]

05:43.952 --> 05:45.083
Is that your chin?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.302
-No, Nina.
-Is that your smile?

05:46.389 --> 05:47.738
-No, Nina.
-Is that your bust?

05:47.825 --> 05:48.826
No, Nina.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.088
Ugh!

05:50.175 --> 05:52.482
-Oh, she's...
-She's amazing.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.484
She pioneered the use
of backstage laxatives.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.833
[sighing]

05:55.920 --> 05:57.487
Lois, if we don't
sign up right now,

05:57.574 --> 05:59.620
we're going to get a dressing
area without a hook.

05:59.707 --> 06:00.969
Is that what you want?

06:01.056 --> 06:02.623
-Bye.
-[giggling]

06:02.710 --> 06:06.366
Well, I think we know
who's winning Mrs. Deluded.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.976
-Oh, Donna...
-[giggling]

06:10.892 --> 06:12.415
I didn't think
it was possible,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.461
but the Mrs.
Tri-County Pageant

06:14.548 --> 06:16.158
is about to get
even uglier.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.248
HAL:
I made the appointment

06:19.335 --> 06:20.554
for your facial tomorrow.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.207
I don't want
to pick out jewelry

06:22.294 --> 06:23.513
until after we
choose the gown.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.036
Now, the red one is nice.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.691
It's tasteful. It really
sets off your hair.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
But the blue one
has a nicer drape

06:29.519 --> 06:32.609
and you cannot beat
its "wow" factor.

06:32.696 --> 06:33.654
You know what?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.003
Let me worry about that.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.134
You can concentrate
on your talent.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.527
I don't know, Hal.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.008
I'm not even sure
you can call it a talent.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.139
What are you talking about?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.576
It is going to be great.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.491
That's why I blocked out
the next three hours

06:44.578 --> 06:45.796
for you to work with Dewey.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.407
Dad, I have homework!

06:47.494 --> 06:49.147
Oh, just buy it from the guy
Reese buys his from.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.412
WOMAN:
Okay, ladies, I know

06:52.499 --> 06:54.762
you've all done it
a million times before,

06:54.849 --> 06:56.677
but let's just
walk through it once anyway.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.244
Blue line ladies,
cross over the red mark.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.246
Green line, cross over
the yellow mark.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.031
Blue line,
stop at the orange mark,

07:03.118 --> 07:04.902
step left and cross
to the green line.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.556
Green line,
stop to the black mark.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.863
-Ooh!
-Step right and cross to the...

07:08.950 --> 07:10.342
green line.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.953
Malcolm! I need you
to do a job for me.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.868
It's urgent.
I've been exchanging

07:13.955 --> 07:16.697
some very meaningful glances
with one of the contestants.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.568
You know they're all
married, don't you?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.527
Yes, of course.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.398
And that's why
it would be indecent of me

07:22.485 --> 07:23.399
not to be discreet.

07:23.486 --> 07:24.748
Darlene Fisher.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.489
Green sweat suit.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.056
-WOMAN: Changes...
-[indistinct chattering]

07:28.143 --> 07:29.536
I need you to pass her
this note for me.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.407
You want me to find out
if she likes you?

07:31.494 --> 07:32.452
Forget it.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.931
I respect your stand, Malcolm,

07:34.018 --> 07:35.498
and I want you to know
this will in no way

07:35.585 --> 07:37.631
affect my judging
of your mother.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.067
Or will it?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.158
WOMAN: Good, Marsha.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.031
-[sighs]
-WOMAN: Cross over.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.035
Okay, you're next.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.428
-[sighs]
-Now, no matter what question

07:52.515 --> 07:54.604
they ask you, remember
to use your key phrases:

07:54.691 --> 07:56.911
"empowering women,
the beauty within,

07:56.998 --> 07:58.608
helping those in need."

07:58.695 --> 08:01.742
And don't forget, end with,
"May God bless America."

08:01.829 --> 08:02.830
Right, right, and when
do I say the stuff

08:02.917 --> 08:04.266
about world peace?

08:04.353 --> 08:05.920
No, no, no, no, no,
we got rid of that.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.617
You don't want to come off
like a liberal nut case.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.880
DARLENE:
Yes, I am a mother,

08:09.967 --> 08:13.623
but I also have to
remember that I'm a woman.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.147
A woman who's
not afraid to give

so good.

Okay, Lois...

08:30.684 --> 08:32.207
here's your question,
if you're ready:

08:33.207 --> 08:37.125
"How has motherhood
kept you young?"

08:37.212 --> 08:38.779
WOMAN: Good question.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.476
Wish I'd thought of that.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.433
[indistinct chattering]

08:43.740 --> 08:46.917
I'm sorry, but I have
a problem with the question.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.618
Motherhood definitely
does a lot of things,

08:51.705 --> 08:53.576
but the one thing it
does not do is keep you young.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.448
Oh, my God,
it ages you horribly.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.538
Youth is about having choices,

08:58.625 --> 09:00.714
but once you're a mother,
you have no choices.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.846
You're stuck
loving your children.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.674
You get gray hair loving them.

09:04.761 --> 09:05.893
You lose sleep loving them.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.416
You lose out
on all those other things

09:07.503 --> 09:08.939
that you always
thought you'd do.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.420
But even with all of that,

09:11.507 --> 09:13.291
the amazing thing is,

09:13.378 --> 09:14.510
you're okay with it.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.381
It's like
some wonderful...

Okay, Donna, here we go.

09:44.409 --> 09:48.370
"What aspect of being a woman
do you find most fulfilling?"

you're stupid.

I... the question is...

09:57.858 --> 09:59.033
I mean...

10:00.121 --> 10:01.557
I'm not fulfilled.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.559
It's awful being
a woman, right?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.647
Right?

10:04.734 --> 10:05.953
I'm cursed with children, too.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.085
I never wanted to have kids.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.434
I just wanted to...

I'm really doing okay.

So you gonna keep wasting time
high-fiving yourself,

10:30.368 --> 10:32.109

10:38.812 --> 10:41.684
Okay, honey, that
was pretty good.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.251
Unfortunately,
there are three counties

be going so much better

Unattractive people can become
very threatened by this.

come back in 20 years,
and we'll talk.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.856
Ugh.

17:11.943 --> 17:12.857
No, please!

17:12.944 --> 17:14.381
This can't be how it ends.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.772
I'm supposed to have
three rocky marriages

17:15.859 --> 17:17.601
and die in a hotel fire!

17:17.688 --> 17:18.993
Don't send me home!

17:19.080 --> 17:22.258
I'm too perfect
to live like a person!

17:22.345 --> 17:24.565
Okay, people reacted badly

17:24.652 --> 17:26.696
to the crown thing, so you gotta
nail the talent portion.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.525
Now, I know you think
it isn't a talent,

17:28.612 --> 17:29.918
but if you commit,

17:30.005 --> 17:31.354
we can make
those oversized Barbies

17:31.441 --> 17:33.356
choke on their own batons.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.359
What are you doing?

17:36.446 --> 17:37.665
Where's your top hat
and fishnet thigh-highs?

17:37.752 --> 17:38.840
Just get the car
and the kids, Hal,

17:38.927 --> 17:40.015
and let's slink
out of here.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.756
Wait, you can't just walk away.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.279
Oh, yes, I can.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.064
This whole thing
has been a disaster.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.456
I don't belong here.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.458
And I hate the way
those women make me feel.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.591
Come on, they're
just a bunch of bitter hags.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.072
And I hate the way
you've been making me feel.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.683
We may have
our ups and downs, Hal,

17:55.770 --> 17:56.988
but this is the first
time I ever felt

17:57.076 --> 17:58.773
like I wasn't
good enough for you.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.385
You're right.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.691
I'm sorry.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.824
I mean, I know you're perfect,

18:06.911 --> 18:08.652
and for once, I wanted
the whole world to know it.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.351
Well, that's a nice idea,
but that isn't going to happen.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.482
I don't know
why I ever thought

18:12.569 --> 18:14.180
I could compete
with these women.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.225
Hal, I can't handle them.
I'm out of my league here.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.661
What are you talking about?

18:17.748 --> 18:20.273
Do you know why those
broads pulled that stunt?

18:20.360 --> 18:23.102
They're afraid of you, Lois.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
Right now,
you are surrounded

18:24.929 --> 18:26.757
by a bunch of idiots
who fear you.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.412
You're not
out of your league.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.761
You're at home.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.113
Lois, where
have you been?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.462
Come on, let's go.
You're up.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.028
You've got to go!

18:42.730 --> 18:45.124
Whining isn't going
to make me go any faster.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.082
Yes!

18:47.169 --> 18:49.345
DR. DAVE: And now
our third contestant,

18:49.432 --> 18:51.739
Lois, will be accompanied
by her lovely daughter,

18:51.826 --> 18:53.132
Dewey.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.134
[applause]

18:59.399 --> 19:01.444
[audience murmuring]

19:05.753 --> 19:07.102
[whispers]:
It's Mommy.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.367
[playing dramatic tune]

19:18.113 --> 19:20.724
[whistling romantic melody]

19:24.163 --> 19:25.555
[soft gasping]

19:34.129 --> 19:35.522
[indistinct murmuring]

19:35.609 --> 19:37.176
[whistling continues]

19:58.762 --> 20:01.243
[sobbing]

20:04.899 --> 20:07.510
[whistling intricate tune]

20:17.607 --> 20:19.043
[music and whistling stop]

20:19.130 --> 20:20.915
[thunderous applause]

20:21.002 --> 20:23.570
[cheering]

20:23.657 --> 20:24.788
Whoo!

20:27.051 --> 20:29.402
[sobbing]

20:30.968 --> 20:31.926
MAN: Brilliant!

20:33.449 --> 20:35.973
Would the new Mrs. Tri-County

20:36.060 --> 20:37.714
like another scoop
of fudge ripple?

20:37.801 --> 20:40.326
Well, this sash still has
a couple of inches of slack.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.588
-Keep it coming.
-[Hal chuckles]

20:41.675 --> 20:43.154
LOIS: This is so nice.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.286
Look at this.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.070
A $40 coupon
for new tires,

20:46.157 --> 20:49.944
a box of steaks, a label maker!

20:50.031 --> 20:51.772
Oh, this is nice.

20:51.859 --> 20:54.514
I wish Reese wasn't too busy
sulking to enjoy it with us.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.776
Give him a little time.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.956
[sobbing]

21:20.540 --> 21:25.022
[audience applauding,
victory music playing]

21:25.109 --> 21:27.547
[sobbing]

21:27.634 --> 21:31.420
[cheering]

21:31.507 --> 21:32.639
[sobbing continues]

21:32.726 --> 21:34.641
WOMAN: Reese,
you're the best!

21:37.252 --> 21:39.863
[sobs echoing in auditorium]

21:42.823 --> 21:44.694
[sobbing continues]

22:22.471 --> 22:24.386
