00:00.091 --> 00:02.388
Previously on "Dead of Summer"...

00:02.438 --> 00:04.111
I love this camp.
All my first were here.

00:04.161 --> 00:07.160
First girlfriend,
first kiss. First everything.

00:07.210 --> 00:09.348
If it was so great, why only one summer?

00:09.398 --> 00:11.573
My dad was killed in the
line of duty in '82.

00:11.705 --> 00:12.795
I'm sorry.

00:12.845 --> 00:14.295
Down by the lake, I saw these people.

00:14.345 --> 00:15.611
They were wearing these masks.

00:15.661 --> 00:17.615
Jack Sykes. This belonged to my father.

00:17.665 --> 00:18.858
He was doing the same thing we are.

00:18.957 --> 00:21.766
Carolina Maria Diaz,
if you wish to communicate

00:21.816 --> 00:23.592
with us, please give us a sign.

00:25.334 --> 00:26.501
You should have killed Amy

00:26.551 --> 00:28.035
when you had the chance.

00:28.085 --> 00:29.829
Did you not just see
what happened to Amy?

00:29.879 --> 00:30.950
She was possessed.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.253
What happened to me?

00:32.304 --> 00:33.338
We woke something up.

00:33.707 --> 00:34.783
Something bad.

01:07.828 --> 01:09.592
Time to lose your cherry, pal.

01:13.185 --> 01:14.720
I don't know, man.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.349
We spent all week in detention

01:16.399 --> 01:19.319
because Principal Assface
didn't like our t-shirts.

01:20.969 --> 01:22.795
Let's redecorate his car.

01:23.174 --> 01:24.955
We could get in big trouble.

01:25.005 --> 01:27.092
Come on. He's out for the weekend.

01:27.142 --> 01:28.989
He'll never even know it was us.

01:29.039 --> 01:31.035
You wanted to get back
at him, didn't you?

01:31.085 --> 01:32.364
Here's your chance.

01:33.973 --> 01:37.256
It's time to ask
yourself... How far are you willing to go?

01:54.839 --> 01:56.046
Hang on.

01:58.279 --> 01:59.530
We're not done here.

02:28.438 --> 02:30.595
Damon, get in the car.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.057
Hi, Dad.

02:41.108 --> 02:42.628
Get in the car, Garrett.

02:50.048 --> 02:52.449
He gave us detention for no reason.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.004
I was just getting even.

02:54.054 --> 02:56.452
You're always getting even, Garrett.

02:56.502 --> 02:57.940
And now you're dragging Damon down, too.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.729
He's a good kid.

03:00.726 --> 03:03.329
Only he doesn't have a dad
to bail him out like you.

03:05.888 --> 03:07.282
You think you're hurting me?

03:09.795 --> 03:11.292
You're only hurting yourself.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.636
Sorry we can't all be
perfect like you, Dad.

03:14.686 --> 03:16.760
I'm not asking you to be like me.

03:18.296 --> 03:20.863
I'm just trying of seeing you
work so hard to be the opposite.

03:20.913 --> 03:22.688
What are you gonna do? Ground me?

03:22.738 --> 03:24.799
Threaten military school again?

03:24.849 --> 03:26.559
I had something else in mind.

03:31.996 --> 03:33.894
You can't do this.

03:33.944 --> 03:37.543
Every summer, they kindly offer
me to send you free of charge.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.860
Every summer, you say no way.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.997
Well, this time, there's no choice.

03:45.689 --> 03:48.717
Hey, you're 14 now.

03:49.573 --> 03:52.137
It's time to decide what kind
of man you want to be.

03:53.408 --> 03:56.784
Boyd, I'm telling you, we
can't sit and wait anymore.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.369
At least two people
are dead at that camp,

03:58.419 --> 04:00.061
and if I'm right,
it's not gonna end there.

04:00.111 --> 04:01.547
Where are you getting all this?

04:01.597 --> 04:03.899
This ritual, it's been tried before.

04:04.229 --> 04:06.009
There's five steps, and these creeps

04:06.059 --> 04:07.726
have already done three of them.

04:07.776 --> 04:10.047
The fresh blood we found
in the woods last night,

04:10.097 --> 04:12.207
according to this, that means step four

04:12.257 --> 04:14.023
gets carried out the following sundown.

04:14.073 --> 04:15.085
Meaning tonight.

04:15.135 --> 04:16.737
And the fourth step is?

04:16.786 --> 04:18.555
They think they're gonna raise a demon

04:19.005 --> 04:20.389
by "sacrificing an innocent."

04:20.439 --> 04:22.147
But let's call it what it really is...

04:22.197 --> 04:23.452
Murder.

04:24.183 --> 04:26.794
So you really think this is tied to...

04:27.202 --> 04:28.214
what happened to Jack?

04:28.264 --> 04:29.520
I know it.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.581
My dad researched it, knew
everything there was to know.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.934
And that's what got him killed.

04:36.001 --> 04:37.537
He knew too much.

04:39.248 --> 04:40.501
Okay.

04:41.921 --> 04:43.172
Okay?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.502
Let's get 'em.

04:44.748 --> 04:47.076
We go in, show no mercy.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.500
Now you're talking.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.495
Let's call the state police,
get some real backup.

04:50.545 --> 04:53.252
Okay. What do you think
they're gonna say?

04:53.705 --> 04:56.459
You know, we're townies,
small potatoes, hicks.

04:56.509 --> 04:57.520
They'll laugh at us.

04:57.570 --> 04:59.394
And by the time they get here,

04:59.586 --> 05:02.226
Damon and his pals will be
eight steps ahead of us.

05:02.347 --> 05:03.573
So what?

05:03.872 --> 05:05.465
We sit back and do nothing?

05:06.762 --> 05:08.818
No. We catch 'em in the act.

05:09.012 --> 05:10.262
How?

05:14.146 --> 05:15.546
You want me to be bait?

05:15.596 --> 05:17.214
You're the one they're targeting.

05:17.264 --> 05:18.312
They've had their eyes on you

05:18.362 --> 05:19.702
since the night of the masked ball.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.033
You won't be in any danger, Amy.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.019
Yeah, except for the dozen Satanists
trying to kill her.

05:24.069 --> 05:26.915
I will personally keep my eyes
on Amy the entire time.

05:26.965 --> 05:28.522
We just need to draw them out,

05:28.572 --> 05:30.198
then we'll be done with them for good.

05:30.859 --> 05:32.194
But we need your help.

05:32.589 --> 05:33.460
All of you.

05:33.510 --> 05:37.050
This is an absolutely terrible idea.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.089
You want to bring
violent criminals into a camp

05:40.139 --> 05:41.355
filled with kids?

05:41.405 --> 05:43.056
Today's Color Wars, right?

05:43.334 --> 05:44.571
Bring the kids to the mess hall.

05:44.621 --> 05:47.186
Have them work on signs
or art or whatever.

05:47.236 --> 05:48.408
They'll be out of the line of fire.

05:48.458 --> 05:50.545
The line of fire? Are you...
Are you hearing this?

05:50.595 --> 05:52.532
Ms. Carpenter, this is the best way.

05:52.582 --> 05:55.389
We do this, we get
these guys, camp can continue.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.911
But if we cause panic
or if we don't get them,

05:57.961 --> 06:00.406
then that's it. The camp closes again.

06:00.456 --> 06:02.315
Only this time, it'll be for good.

06:02.365 --> 06:05.050
Now, how much did you
sink into this place?

06:06.101 --> 06:08.531
Why me? What did I do to them?

06:08.581 --> 06:10.833
Nothing. You're innocent in all this.

06:10.883 --> 06:12.588
And that's why they're targeting you.

06:14.690 --> 06:17.640
And if we don't catch them now,
they won't stop with me.

06:18.871 --> 06:23.494
If this is what it takes to
protect us and protect the camp ...

06:23.544 --> 06:25.089
then count me in.

06:27.361 --> 06:28.712
Thanks, Amy.

06:29.092 --> 06:31.614
The second I don't like
how this is going,

06:31.664 --> 06:32.951
I'm calling it off, got it?

06:33.001 --> 06:34.281
Yes. Of course.

06:34.331 --> 06:35.661
You guys just keep watch.

06:35.711 --> 06:37.524
The moment you see something suspicious,

06:37.574 --> 06:38.980
you hit us on the walkie.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.458
Don't do anything stupid.

06:40.508 --> 06:41.842
These guys are dangerous.

06:41.892 --> 06:44.441
You think I'm scared of some douchebag
in a "Slayer" t-shirt?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.351
Blair and I will take patrol.

06:47.027 --> 06:48.567
I'm not afraid of these guys.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.809
Well, you should be.

06:49.859 --> 06:52.062
They killed Dave and Cricket.

06:52.317 --> 06:53.933
Nobody be a hero here.

06:53.983 --> 06:55.346
Take care of each other.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.425
And call us the minute
you have eyes on them.

06:57.475 --> 06:58.768
This ends tonight.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.751
We're all here for the same reason.

07:09.613 --> 07:11.281
Before we met The Teacher,

07:13.272 --> 07:14.625
everything sucked.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.586
We were lost.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.318
Disrespected.

07:22.205 --> 07:23.482
Invisible.

07:25.381 --> 07:27.205
Nobody cared about us.

07:28.718 --> 07:30.320
Nobody noticed us.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.560
Until The Teacher.

07:37.351 --> 07:39.967
He showed us our potential.

07:40.889 --> 07:45.337
So now isn't it time that
we demonstrate our loyalty?

07:48.712 --> 07:51.295
Call the vessel.

07:51.551 --> 07:54.911
Call... to... the vessel.

08:03.601 --> 08:05.128
You want this, don't you?

08:06.342 --> 08:07.970
How far are you willing to go?

08:14.380 --> 08:16.745
Call... to... the...

08:16.795 --> 08:18.392
Amy!

08:18.442 --> 08:20.990
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.651
Amy...

08:28.012 --> 08:30.642
Your sacrifice will be rewarded.

08:57.082 --> 09:00.131
Now, let's go get our girl.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.371
Want a candy apple?

09:14.984 --> 09:17.133
I love 'em, but...
-I'm good.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.755
I'm Jessica.

09:19.805 --> 09:21.328
But everybody calls me Jessie.

09:21.378 --> 09:22.638
What's your name?

09:23.254 --> 09:25.335
Why do you care? We're not friends.

09:25.385 --> 09:27.493
Not yet, but we could be.

09:27.606 --> 09:30.055
We're on the same team, you know?

09:30.105 --> 09:31.460
Team?

09:31.510 --> 09:32.770
Team Red.

09:34.525 --> 09:36.759
Okay, here's the
thing... Color Wars start today.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.131
I've been on Team Red for three years,

09:38.181 --> 09:39.668
and we've never won.

09:39.718 --> 09:42.944
But this year, I think
we can turn it around

09:42.994 --> 09:44.654
if we work together.

09:44.704 --> 09:45.836
What do you say?

09:45.886 --> 09:48.203
All right, get off your butt.
It is tug-of-war time.

09:48.253 --> 09:50.147
We about to kick some Team Blue ass.

09:50.197 --> 09:51.569
You heard Michael.

09:51.619 --> 09:52.700
Come on. Let's go.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.005
Come on.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.897
Come on, hustle.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.263
Hey, Townie, I hear your mom

10:13.313 --> 10:15.380
gives truckers handies at the diner.

10:16.152 --> 10:18.170
Whoa!... Whoa!

10:19.533 --> 10:20.957
- Fight! Fight!
- Hey, hey, hey!

10:21.007 --> 10:22.266
- Fight! Fight!
- Hey!

10:27.044 --> 10:28.236
Keep punching him!

10:28.286 --> 10:29.785
Hey!

10:29.835 --> 10:31.635
- Hey, that's enough!
- Come on, knock it off.

10:31.685 --> 10:32.943
It's over.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.118
Hey. We're supposed to be a team.

10:37.168 --> 10:38.697
I couldn't let that go.

10:38.747 --> 10:40.562
You know, you don't
always have to get even.

10:40.612 --> 10:41.945
You lost the game for everyone.

10:41.995 --> 10:43.372
Who cares?!

10:44.263 --> 10:45.849
Thanks a lot, Townie.

10:45.899 --> 10:47.828
My pleasure, Braces!

10:53.942 --> 10:55.635
You okay with all this, Jessie?

10:55.835 --> 10:57.129
Of course not.

10:57.179 --> 10:58.884
Is Amy gonna be okay?

10:58.934 --> 11:00.118
Of course.

11:00.168 --> 11:02.345
Heelan's watching her right now.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.658
We just have to draw 'em out.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.487
So she's just gonna act like
she's getting Color Wars ready.

11:05.537 --> 11:07.178
The second he sees
anyone try to take her...

11:07.228 --> 11:09.200
Boom... we swoop in.

11:13.408 --> 11:14.669
Amy...

11:30.513 --> 11:32.188
Did you hear that?

11:34.711 --> 11:36.146
Hear what?

12:04.273 --> 12:07.670
Just do me a favor... stay
away from Golden Grove today.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.978
Golden Grove?

12:09.850 --> 12:11.243
According to this map,

12:11.959 --> 12:14.118
that's where the ritual's
gonna take place.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.458
Isn't that where your dad was killed?

12:23.963 --> 12:24.833
I'll come with you.

12:24.883 --> 12:25.893
We can make sure Amy's fine together.

12:25.943 --> 12:27.802
We are not doing anything, Jessie.

12:27.852 --> 12:28.896
We're supposed to be a team, remember?

12:28.946 --> 12:30.677
This is the Color Wars.

12:31.565 --> 12:32.653
Jessie.

12:32.703 --> 12:34.543
Deb want's our help
getting the kids inside.

12:34.891 --> 12:36.134
Don't worry.

12:36.184 --> 12:37.414
We can handle Damon's crew.

12:37.464 --> 12:39.076
What if this Holyoke is behind it?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.703
He's been dead for a century.

12:40.753 --> 12:42.009
Look, I know you believe this stuff...

12:42.059 --> 12:43.017
If you saw what I did...

12:43.067 --> 12:44.701
What we saw... You would, too.

12:44.751 --> 12:47.119
What I see is history repeating itself.

12:47.413 --> 12:48.757
Holyoke isn't behind this.

12:48.807 --> 12:49.850
It's people copying Holyoke.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.930
And those people are the
ones we need to focus on...

12:51.980 --> 12:53.965
The ones we can actually arrest.

12:55.533 --> 12:56.579
Look, I have to go meet the sheriff.

12:56.629 --> 12:58.333
You call me as soon as you see anything.

13:02.356 --> 13:03.955
Joel, Joel. You got to come see this.

13:04.005 --> 13:05.636
Shh. What's wrong?

13:05.686 --> 13:07.561
Anton was drawing again this morning,

13:07.611 --> 13:10.164
and I think he might
still be talking to Holyoke.

13:10.795 --> 13:12.411
Come on. Let's go.

13:27.211 --> 13:28.484
Amy?

13:30.426 --> 13:31.694
Amy?

13:34.085 --> 13:35.337
Boyd.

13:35.802 --> 13:37.407
Boyd, what happened?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.144
Where is she, Boyd?

13:44.373 --> 13:46.054
Sheriff Heelan, this is Deputy Sykes.

13:46.104 --> 13:47.410
I need you to res...

14:03.015 --> 14:04.440
Amy...

14:10.555 --> 14:12.171
Amy...

14:12.993 --> 14:16.484
I heard your call, and I am ready.

14:32.069 --> 14:34.381
Well, it was kind of close.

14:34.431 --> 14:35.642
You know what they say...

14:35.692 --> 14:37.817
Close only counts in
horseshoes and hand grenades.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.922
Looks like you would have
taken out a whole squad.

14:43.897 --> 14:45.236
Yes!

14:49.839 --> 14:52.236
Dad, what are you doing here?
What did I do this time?

14:52.286 --> 14:53.861
Relax, kiddo.

14:55.051 --> 14:56.650
I'm not here for you.

14:58.044 --> 14:59.142
I'm here for Michael.

14:59.192 --> 15:01.549
Bull. You're just here to harass me.

15:01.905 --> 15:04.919
He had a nervous breakdown
at Golden Grove.

15:04.969 --> 15:06.830
Talking to himself, blabbering on about

15:06.880 --> 15:08.599
some vision he had about a cave.

15:09.558 --> 15:10.767
It's no joke, kiddo.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.105
He's messed up.

15:12.155 --> 15:14.299
And you're just here to help him pack?

15:15.147 --> 15:16.740
Just doing my job.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.077
And I thought I would
say hi while I was here.

15:20.686 --> 15:21.979
Okay.

15:22.828 --> 15:24.306
Well, I better get to it.

15:38.498 --> 15:40.545
Amy?

15:40.595 --> 15:41.994
Amy!

15:49.184 --> 15:50.907
Everyone, have you seen Amy?

15:50.957 --> 15:52.068
I've searched everywhere. She's gone.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.843
She's gone?

15:53.893 --> 15:54.971
What do you mean she's gone?

15:55.021 --> 15:58.149
I mean I can't find her or Heelan.

15:58.199 --> 16:02.045
Counselors, I want you back
to the mess hall, now.

16:03.718 --> 16:04.968
Counselors,

16:05.254 --> 16:07.807
I want you back to the mess hall.

16:07.857 --> 16:09.189
Deb?

16:09.239 --> 16:10.691
Hello? Deb?

16:11.036 --> 16:12.397
Damn it.

16:13.185 --> 16:14.427
I think we should go back.

16:14.477 --> 16:16.451
We volunteered as lookout.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.760
I have a really bad feeling about this.

16:20.281 --> 16:23.046
If Damon and his crew
show up, I came prepared.

16:23.777 --> 16:26.004
A knife? Really?

16:26.054 --> 16:27.125
Well, that's gratitude for you.

16:27.175 --> 16:28.726
I'm just trying to protect you.

16:28.776 --> 16:30.463
Or overcompensate.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.988
What's that supposed to mean?

16:33.290 --> 16:34.257
Sorry.

16:34.307 --> 16:36.218
It's just the... the tension.

16:36.268 --> 16:37.566
I... I wasn't thinking.

16:37.616 --> 16:39.272
It was really rude.

16:39.322 --> 16:40.919
Yeah, it was.

16:41.213 --> 16:43.959
Look, it's just hard for me
to understand, Drew, you know?

16:44.009 --> 16:45.810
Well, what's there to understand?

16:45.860 --> 16:47.157
I'm a guy.

16:48.138 --> 16:50.698
You're right. I mean, I'm an idiot.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.717
You know, does it make you feel better

16:52.767 --> 16:54.583
that I'm an insensitive jerk?

16:54.633 --> 16:57.284
I mean, just... just
kill me now, because I...

17:00.274 --> 17:01.859
Oh, my God.

17:01.909 --> 17:02.894
Ah!

17:02.944 --> 17:04.727
Ow!

17:04.777 --> 17:06.067
Ah!

17:06.117 --> 17:07.608
Let me look at it.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.509
How does it look?

17:15.296 --> 17:16.744
Not great.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.529
That way. To the left.

17:27.236 --> 17:28.272
What are you guys doing here?

17:28.323 --> 17:29.839
Show him the picture.

17:29.889 --> 17:33.725
Anton drew Golden Grove
today with Holyoke's help.

17:33.775 --> 17:35.371
I was just there.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.879
There's no sign of Amy.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.614
Plus, Golden Grove doesn't
look anything like this.

17:42.749 --> 17:44.239
Wait...

17:44.289 --> 17:45.837
You said Anton drew this this morning?

17:45.887 --> 17:47.923
Yeah, he did. Why?

17:47.973 --> 17:51.158
Because somebody else drew it in 1982.

17:56.015 --> 17:57.366
M. Goodson.

17:57.932 --> 17:59.193
Michael.

18:00.356 --> 18:01.720
That's my brother.

18:02.750 --> 18:03.840
Michael Goodson's your brother?

18:03.890 --> 18:05.642
He was a counselor here in '82.

18:05.692 --> 18:07.035
Had to leave halfway through the summer.

18:07.085 --> 18:08.782
Did he ever talk to you
about this picture?

18:08.832 --> 18:11.070
He was never the same after that summer.

18:12.129 --> 18:13.472
He took his own life.

18:14.836 --> 18:15.852
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

18:15.902 --> 18:16.946
Oh, my God. That
summer, when he drew this,

18:16.996 --> 18:18.600
was that when he started seeing Holyoke?

18:18.650 --> 18:19.845
Hold on. H-Hold on.

18:19.895 --> 18:21.545
There must be a reasonable
explanation for this.

18:21.595 --> 18:23.103
This is the reasonable explanation.

18:23.153 --> 18:24.728
Holyoke was showing Anton
and Michael the same place.

18:24.778 --> 18:26.722
But I was just there. It doesn't
look anything like this.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.227
Unless there was...

18:28.277 --> 18:29.594
Unless what?

18:30.161 --> 18:31.642
Your brother...

18:31.692 --> 18:34.491
When they found him,
he... He was talking about a cave.

18:34.541 --> 18:36.698
Maybe this is a drawing of Golden Grove,

18:36.748 --> 18:37.960
just underneath it.

18:38.010 --> 18:39.791
- Let's go find out.
- No.

18:39.841 --> 18:41.604
You three go back to camp.

18:42.650 --> 18:45.021
Your dad went there
alone and died there.

18:45.071 --> 18:46.750
If I know my dad, he went there alone

18:46.800 --> 18:48.894
because he didn't want to
put anyone else in danger.

18:49.368 --> 18:50.684
So neither do I.

19:16.914 --> 19:18.893
The Teacher will be here soon,

19:19.280 --> 19:21.204
and then we'll finally be ready.

19:25.349 --> 19:29.519
It is gonna be... amazing.

19:34.747 --> 19:37.909
You have no idea how long we've
waited to bring it back, Amy.

19:39.172 --> 19:40.770
And now we can...

19:42.963 --> 19:44.404
because of you.

19:45.276 --> 19:48.958
It chose you.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.087
Now...

19:59.973 --> 20:02.322
...we're just gonna
need some of your blood.

20:44.214 --> 20:45.862
I don't want to die out here.

20:49.152 --> 20:50.476
You're not going to.

20:51.534 --> 20:53.491
Although, as far as ways to go,

20:53.541 --> 20:55.824
death by Satanist is pretty punk rock.

20:57.121 --> 20:58.631
Come on. Talk to me.

20:58.681 --> 20:59.755
Take your mind off it.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.437
Just, I'm sorry about what I said.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.324
I've just never met anyone
quite like you.

21:06.727 --> 21:08.236
I've heard that before.

21:08.286 --> 21:09.877
From boyfriends?

21:09.927 --> 21:11.927
What boyfriends?

21:11.977 --> 21:13.717
I've never had any either.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.096
A couple of hook-ups, straight guys.

21:16.146 --> 21:18.079
Whenever I'd try to
take it further, they'd bolt.

21:18.129 --> 21:20.289
So I just kind of gave up.

21:21.278 --> 21:22.571
Until you.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.071
And look how that turned out?

21:25.560 --> 21:26.918
It's all right.

21:27.927 --> 21:29.574
I should probably be thanking you.

21:29.624 --> 21:30.986
For what?

21:32.128 --> 21:34.437
The way you looked at me
when I first got here.

21:34.487 --> 21:36.363
It's how I've always
wanted to be looked at.

21:36.413 --> 21:38.345
Like a hot guy?

21:38.732 --> 21:40.042
Like a guy.

21:41.254 --> 21:42.878
But it is what it is.

21:43.633 --> 21:46.576
I'm glad that we can
be the way we are now.

21:47.756 --> 21:49.331
It's cool if we can be friends.

21:49.381 --> 21:52.997
Blair, Drew, if you can hear
me, get back here, now.

21:53.047 --> 21:54.280
Come on.

22:10.235 --> 22:11.851
What do you say there, junior?

22:12.974 --> 22:15.315
My dad got you out running
his errands again, Uncle Boyd?

22:15.365 --> 22:17.660
Ah, well, actually,
he sent me to apologize.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.276
He's not gonna make it today.

22:19.326 --> 22:22.151
Some case he's on got him
working around the clock.

22:23.039 --> 22:24.610
He totally sent you here to spy on me,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.200
just like the last time he was here

22:26.250 --> 22:27.348
pretending to look into

22:27.398 --> 22:29.469
Michael Goodson and his "visions."

22:29.856 --> 22:32.728
Oh, well, that doesn't
sound like your dad.

22:33.803 --> 22:35.753
You're a terrible spy, Uncle Boyd.

22:36.092 --> 22:37.225
Yeah, well, uh, you enjoy

22:37.275 --> 22:39.284
the rest of the summer, you hear?

22:53.084 --> 22:56.286
Isn't tetherball supposed
to be multiplayer?

22:56.914 --> 22:58.131
I'm practicing.

22:58.181 --> 23:00.405
Some of us actually care about winning.

23:00.455 --> 23:02.232
Your parents stand you up?

23:02.282 --> 23:04.828
No, my mom just couldn't get off work.

23:05.322 --> 23:07.239
She's gonna come pick me
up at the end of camp.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.764
Oh, man. That can't come soon enough.

23:09.814 --> 23:11.259
The only thing getting through

23:11.309 --> 23:13.816
is what I'm gonna do to Lance's
bunk the last day.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.476
What's your problem?

23:16.526 --> 23:17.525
All you ever talk about

23:17.575 --> 23:18.590
is who you're gonna get even with

23:18.640 --> 23:20.134
or how much you hate this place.

23:20.184 --> 23:22.082
Because I do hate this place.

23:23.484 --> 23:26.473
I look forward to coming
to Camp Stillwater all year.

23:26.523 --> 23:28.989
And maybe if you actually
tried, you would, too.

23:57.658 --> 23:59.178
She's ready, Teacher.

24:00.097 --> 24:02.100
All of our enemies have been dealt with.

24:04.913 --> 24:06.843
The final step is yours.

24:29.441 --> 24:32.126
Okay, guys. This is what
it's all been leading to.

24:32.176 --> 24:33.761
Team Red hasn't won a single time

24:33.811 --> 24:35.991
since I started coming to Stillwater.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.315
And that's not gonna change this year

24:37.365 --> 24:40.918
unless we work together as a team.

24:41.152 --> 24:42.418
Now, everybody remembers
the plan, right?

24:42.468 --> 24:44.216
Yes.

24:44.266 --> 24:46.608
Now let's go capture the flag!

25:08.788 --> 25:10.749
You know, you're actually a lot dumber

25:10.799 --> 25:12.294
than I thought you were, Townie.

25:14.218 --> 25:16.185
Come on, did you
really think we'd just let you

25:16.235 --> 25:18.271
walk up in here and take it?

25:18.611 --> 25:20.913
You know, even your daddy can't
help you out of this one.

25:20.963 --> 25:23.301
Looks like you're gonna be leaving camp

25:23.351 --> 25:25.025
the same way you came, Townie...

25:25.824 --> 25:27.097
As a loser.

25:30.624 --> 25:32.558
What's so funny?

25:32.608 --> 25:34.187
You.

25:34.237 --> 25:36.722
'Cause now you're the loser.

25:51.498 --> 25:53.045
Come on, man!

25:53.095 --> 25:54.526
They're getting away!

25:55.116 --> 25:58.081
Stop her! ... Stop her!

25:58.131 --> 25:59.481
Somebody!

26:03.209 --> 26:05.028
You did it, Braces! You won!

26:05.078 --> 26:06.348
No, we won!

26:06.398 --> 26:08.247
We make a good team, Townie.

26:13.967 --> 26:15.251
Amy?

27:05.699 --> 27:06.963
Let her go.

27:07.596 --> 27:08.736
Garrett!

27:08.786 --> 27:10.811
Garrett, help me!

27:11.448 --> 27:12.855
Let her go, Damon.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.754
You don't have to do this.

27:20.161 --> 27:21.750
It's already done, pal.

27:22.813 --> 27:24.819
The Teacher gave the final blessing.

27:25.191 --> 27:26.570
The Teacher?

27:27.744 --> 27:29.013
Where is he?

27:29.854 --> 27:31.324
You just missed him.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.800
I'm gonna count to three.

27:40.889 --> 27:42.662
I thought we were
gonna be friends for life,

27:42.712 --> 27:43.744
you know that, Garrett?

27:43.794 --> 27:46.053
One...

27:46.103 --> 27:49.371
That summer after
you came back from camp...

27:49.421 --> 27:51.158
...two...

27:51.208 --> 27:53.372
...you didn't want
anything to do with me.

27:55.038 --> 27:56.038
What do you want?

27:56.088 --> 27:57.414
What I want,

27:58.255 --> 28:00.595
what we all want,
there's only one way to get.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.668
This world will never
accept us for who we are.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.576
It will only spit on us,

28:07.626 --> 28:09.983
make us feel as small
as it thinks we are.

28:12.316 --> 28:17.274
We are tired of being powerless,
and I know you are, too.

28:21.161 --> 28:23.290
Isn't that why we got
back at that principal?

28:25.700 --> 28:28.080
Now we have a chance
to get back at the world.

28:31.134 --> 28:32.018
Remember a long time ago

28:32.068 --> 28:34.265
you asked me how far
I was willing to go?

28:37.335 --> 28:40.210
Well...

28:40.260 --> 28:41.636
here's your answer.

28:42.985 --> 28:46.101
When our blood mixes with hers...

28:46.983 --> 28:49.224
we live forever.

28:51.705 --> 28:53.052
Your blood?

29:17.168 --> 29:18.446
Amy.

29:25.404 --> 29:26.686
Oh, my God.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.557
Almost there.

29:33.607 --> 29:35.472
Where are we going?

29:35.522 --> 29:37.182
It's the last day of camp.

29:38.057 --> 29:39.910
There's something we need to do.

29:51.111 --> 29:52.760
Now we'll always remember.

29:53.874 --> 29:55.464
It's gonna take more than that.

30:03.148 --> 30:05.139
Looks like your ride's here.

30:09.151 --> 30:11.307
Come on. I want you to meet my dad.

30:11.634 --> 30:12.762
Really?

30:16.108 --> 30:17.416
Hey, Mom.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.697
What's wrong?

30:30.180 --> 30:31.463
Where's Dad?

31:54.348 --> 31:55.458
Are you okay?

31:55.616 --> 31:56.660
She's not breathing.

31:56.710 --> 31:57.949
No.

31:58.488 --> 31:59.747
Come on, Amy.

32:05.598 --> 32:06.879
Come on!

32:07.561 --> 32:09.300
- Amy!
- It's okay.

32:09.648 --> 32:10.694
It's okay. I've got you.

32:10.744 --> 32:12.346
I've got you. Come here.

32:14.249 --> 32:16.633
It's okay. I've got you.

32:16.683 --> 32:17.952
It's okay.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.572
It's okay.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.489
Oh, my God.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.436
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

32:29.486 --> 32:31.234
They can't hurt you anymore.

32:32.655 --> 32:33.537
Garrett?

32:33.587 --> 32:35.264
Garrett, are you...

32:37.179 --> 32:38.704
It's okay. It's okay.

32:41.281 --> 32:43.456
Sheriff, you're alive?

32:43.606 --> 32:44.826
I'm okay.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.267
I found your walkie. How are you...

32:48.317 --> 32:50.554
I got back to the car.
It's a long story.

32:50.604 --> 32:52.504
Where are you? Did you find Damon?

32:52.554 --> 32:53.781
They're dead, Sheriff.

32:54.692 --> 32:55.993
They're all dead.

32:56.425 --> 32:58.557
I'm here with Amy. She's okay.

33:00.429 --> 33:01.690
It's over.

33:02.611 --> 33:04.095
It's all over.

33:09.965 --> 33:11.242
Amy.

33:11.292 --> 33:12.568
Oh, my God.

33:13.749 --> 33:15.513
The kids. Are the kids okay?

33:15.563 --> 33:17.746
They're fine. They're in
the cabins with the staff.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.649
You're bleeding.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.253
What happened?

33:25.724 --> 33:28.259
Okay. Okay, let's
get you to the infirmary.

33:28.309 --> 33:29.563
Okay, give me your arm.

33:29.922 --> 33:31.461
Thank you. Thank you, Jessie.

33:31.511 --> 33:33.303
Okay. You're okay.

33:40.912 --> 33:41.870
You okay?

33:41.920 --> 33:44.443
Yeah. Just a sprain.

33:52.753 --> 33:54.010
What are you doing?

33:54.535 --> 33:58.193
Cricket was the only person
I ever allowed myself

33:58.243 --> 33:59.512
to get close to

33:59.930 --> 34:01.218
until you,

34:02.126 --> 34:04.593
and ... I lost her.

34:05.479 --> 34:07.412
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

34:08.370 --> 34:09.755
We talked about this.

34:09.804 --> 34:11.775
I'm cool with us being friends.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.355
Well, I'm not.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.579
What are you saying?

34:21.089 --> 34:22.880
I'm saying that,
when you first came here,

34:22.931 --> 34:25.219
I thought you were the hottest
guy I'd ever seen.

34:27.007 --> 34:30.797
And... I still do.

34:41.812 --> 34:43.072
How is she?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.717
Shaken up.

34:45.261 --> 34:48.215
It's... It's a lot to process.

34:49.061 --> 34:53.530
Yeah. Pretty much the worst
capture the flag game ever.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.939
Thank you

34:58.949 --> 35:00.507
for everything today.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.100
What is it, Joel?

35:11.012 --> 35:13.047
I just can't stop thinking about him.

35:13.715 --> 35:14.973
Who?

35:16.884 --> 35:18.149
Holyoke.

35:20.037 --> 35:21.904
Are you sure you didn't
see him out there?

35:21.954 --> 35:23.850
Strange things happened tonight,

35:24.737 --> 35:25.998
terrible things,

35:27.143 --> 35:28.825
but they were all done by people.

35:29.540 --> 35:33.674
Crazy people with crazy
ideas, but still... people.

35:33.724 --> 35:36.463
So who was behind it then
if it wasn't Holyoke?

35:36.513 --> 35:38.220
Damon mentioned a teacher,

35:38.514 --> 35:39.699
but who knows if that was real.

35:39.749 --> 35:44.451
Are you sure you didn't see anything...

35:45.417 --> 35:48.514
Anything that you can't explain?

35:51.043 --> 35:52.377
I didn't say that.

35:55.902 --> 35:57.691
Maybe there was no teacher.

35:57.985 --> 35:59.980
Maybe. Maybe not.

36:00.547 --> 36:02.857
But it's over.

36:04.601 --> 36:06.141
At least we have that.

36:06.191 --> 36:07.630
There he is.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.351
You did good today.

36:17.152 --> 36:19.008
Your dad would have been proud.

36:22.062 --> 36:24.810
Still can't believe it... Damon Crowley.

36:25.361 --> 36:26.673
Who knew he'd go this far?

36:26.723 --> 36:29.423
I mean, to... To take his own life...

36:31.376 --> 36:34.270
Yeah, who knew?

36:34.681 --> 36:37.019
Okay, you want to tell me
what happened out there?

36:37.329 --> 36:38.771
Why don't I show you?

36:39.174 --> 36:40.439
Yeah.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.873
Lead the way.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.182
Why don't you...

36:57.280 --> 36:58.565
Teacher?

37:00.503 --> 37:02.552
It was you, all of this.

37:02.602 --> 37:04.819
What are you talking about, junior?

37:08.821 --> 37:10.090
Aah!

37:12.405 --> 37:14.653
I never told you
that Damon killed himself.

37:14.703 --> 37:16.428
I just told you he died.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.669
Everything this summer,
it was your fault.

37:23.811 --> 37:25.099
This summer?

37:25.221 --> 37:27.350
Oh, it's much longer than that.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.575
And tonight was the night

37:28.625 --> 37:30.537
everything was supposed to change.

37:30.952 --> 37:34.236
You ruined everything,
just like your father.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.615
You killed him.

37:43.124 --> 37:44.651
You think I wanted to?

37:45.945 --> 37:48.135
Your dad was my best friend!

37:49.842 --> 37:52.934
But after what you
told me, I had no choice.

37:52.984 --> 37:54.159
What I told you?

37:54.209 --> 37:57.296
Parents Day, 1982.

37:57.356 --> 37:58.813
When you told me your old man

37:58.863 --> 38:00.598
was talking to Michael Goodson,

38:00.648 --> 38:02.949
that he'd heard about Michael's visions.

38:03.438 --> 38:05.693
That's when I knew he
was getting too close.

38:06.731 --> 38:08.445
He treated you like a brother.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.979
This place...

38:11.778 --> 38:13.159
it calls to you.

38:14.939 --> 38:18.754
It called to me, and I answered.

38:18.946 --> 38:20.548
I'm one of the chosen.

38:20.874 --> 38:22.340
You're a murderer.

38:23.486 --> 38:28.439
You killed him and Dave and Cricket.

38:28.850 --> 38:32.473
Your father, I had to.

38:33.628 --> 38:34.672
But the others? No.

38:34.722 --> 38:35.985
Stop lying.

38:36.036 --> 38:37.674
We had nothing to do with them.

38:37.724 --> 38:39.024
You're lying to me.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.840
Just like you lied to Damon.

38:42.439 --> 38:43.867
He trusted you.

38:44.016 --> 38:45.598
He died for you.

38:46.203 --> 38:48.161
At least I didn't abandon him.

38:54.785 --> 38:57.090
It doesn't have to end the same for you

38:57.140 --> 38:58.810
as it did for your dad.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.233
I always wanted to bring you in,

39:02.283 --> 39:04.524
but I knew the answer would be no.

39:06.529 --> 39:08.411
There's still a chance for us though.

39:09.733 --> 39:11.033
We're family.

39:13.471 --> 39:14.741
I love you, junior.

39:18.131 --> 39:20.447
There is a... a power here at Stillwater

39:20.497 --> 39:23.820
that's greater than anything
you can possibly imagine.

39:25.426 --> 39:28.816
We can tap into that together.

39:30.672 --> 39:34.029
All you have to do is ... join me.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.353
Put gun down, son.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.451
I will never join you.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.223
You'll never kill me, either.

39:50.549 --> 39:52.086
You're too good.

39:54.972 --> 39:56.647
You're just like Jack.

39:58.893 --> 40:00.397
I'm not my dad.
