WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.071
WALSH:
So this is what it is.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.804
Talking about
communication.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.740
Talking about language.
Not the same thing.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.676
It's about
inspiration,

00:09.710 --> 00:11.512
not the idea,
but the moment

00:11.544 --> 00:14.314
before the idea,
when it's total.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.350
When it blossoms in your mind
and connects to everything.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.219
It's about the thoughts
and experiences

00:19.253 --> 00:21.254
that we don't
have a word for.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.824
A demonstration.

00:23.856 --> 00:25.259
Buffy Summers.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.161
(students murmuring)

00:27.195 --> 00:28.896
Come on down to
the front here.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.670
A typical
college girl,

00:36.704 --> 00:38.171
one assumes.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.073
Lie down on my desk.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.942
What?

00:41.975 --> 00:44.112
Go ahead. You're perfectly safe.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.579
(students murmuring)

00:55.655 --> 00:58.491
Riley, if you could oblige.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.295
A demonstration, right?

01:02.329 --> 01:04.831
Be a good boy.

01:17.144 --> 01:20.548
This feels very strange.

01:20.581 --> 01:25.018
Don't worry. If I kiss you,
it'll make the sun go down.

01:41.668 --> 01:45.872
(whooshing, wind whistling)

01:53.847 --> 01:56.183
See?

01:58.686 --> 02:01.454
Fortune favors the brave.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.891
(little girl humming)

02:06.126 --> 02:08.527
Do you hear that?

02:12.832 --> 02:16.637
* Can't even shout,
can't even cry *

02:16.670 --> 02:20.341
* The gentlemen are coming by

02:20.373 --> 02:23.143
* Looking in windows,
knocking on doors *

02:23.176 --> 02:27.881
* They need to take seven,
and they might take yours *

02:27.914 --> 02:31.551
* Can't call to Mom,
can't say a word *

02:31.585 --> 02:35.889
* You're gonna die screaming,
but you won't be heard... *

02:37.890 --> 02:39.526
WALSH:
So I'll see you
all on Monday

02:39.560 --> 02:41.127
for a final
review session.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.463
WILLOW:
Man, that was an
exciting class.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.800
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Wow.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.802
Uh. And the last 20 minutes--
it was a revelation.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.538
Just laid out
everything we need

02:51.572 --> 02:52.973
to know for the final.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
I'd hate to have missed that.
Just tell me

02:54.707 --> 02:56.043
I didn't snore.

02:56.075 --> 02:59.012
Very discreet.
Minimal drool.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.181
Oh, yay.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.883
So, were you dreaming?

03:03.917 --> 03:07.020
Yeah. And it was
kind of intense.

03:07.054 --> 03:11.658
Intense. Really? 'Cause
you seemed so peaceful.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.193
Of course, it was only
for a moment.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.697
Right. Hey, you guys
headed over toward Judd?

03:16.729 --> 03:19.500
Uh, student center.
Oh, great. So, this dream?

03:19.533 --> 03:23.170
You know, you guys go.
I'm gonna do the thing.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.573
So I'll see you
after Wicca group.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.007
Okay. Bye.

03:27.039 --> 03:29.742
Bye. So tell me about your
dream.

03:29.776 --> 03:34.081
As a psych major,
I'm qualified to go, "Hmm."

03:34.114 --> 03:36.683
I don't really remember it.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.621
Well, did I appear
at all in this dream?

03:40.653 --> 03:42.522
There might've been a cameo.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.091
Is that right?

03:44.123 --> 03:46.225
Maybe more like
a featured role.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.061
RILEY:
Romantic lead?

03:48.094 --> 03:50.062
BUFFY:
I'm not saying a word.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.199
So what have you got
going on tonight?

03:52.231 --> 03:54.768
Oh, patrolling.
Patrolling?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.903
(bells tolling)
Uh, petroleum.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.206
Petroleum?
Uh-huh.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.442
Tonight you have crude oil?

04:01.474 --> 04:04.076
And homework.
Hmm.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.280
What about you?

04:06.313 --> 04:09.049
Oh, you know,
grading papers.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.585
Ah, that'll be fun.

04:11.618 --> 04:15.155
Not petroleum fun,
but it passes the time.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.089
So, I, uh...

04:17.124 --> 04:19.427
Yeah.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.497
I guess I won't see you until...

04:24.531 --> 04:27.266
Yeah.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.572
What papers?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.507
Papers?

04:34.542 --> 04:38.646
Um, grading what papers?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.913
We only have the final.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.317
Oh, yeah. Um... no, I...

04:44.351 --> 04:46.819
Late. Late papers
I got to look at.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.189
Oh, okay.

04:49.221 --> 04:51.091
Neat.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.293
So, uh...

04:53.326 --> 04:54.795
Class.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.295
I'll see you then, huh?

04:56.329 --> 04:58.298
Yeah.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.202
Fortune favors the brave.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.877
(wolf howling)

05:10.911 --> 05:13.180
*

06:01.360 --> 06:03.062
"Can't even shout,
can't even cry.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.064
The gentlemen are coming by."

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
It sounds vaguely familiar.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.370
You sure it's nothing you heard
when you were a child?

06:10.403 --> 06:13.406
All right. Nothing else?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.709
Well, it-it could, um,

06:16.744 --> 06:19.447
definitely be one
of your prophetic dreams,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.415
or it could just be the eternal
mystery that is your brain.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.884
Look, I'll-I'll check it out,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.752
and, um, I'll let you know
if I find something.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.088
All right, bye-bye.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.293
Have you heard of a group
called "The Gentlemen"?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.928
Group of what?
The Gentlemen.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.899
Don't know.
You certain?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.468
No. We're out of Weetabix.

06:41.502 --> 06:45.072
We are out of Weetabix
because you ate it all again.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.040
Get some more.
(sighs)

06:47.074 --> 06:50.778
I thought vampires
were supposed to eat blood.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.612
Yeah, well, sometimes

06:52.646 --> 06:54.915
I like to crumble up
the Weetabix in the blood.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.951
Gives it a little texture.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.819
Since the picture
you just painted

06:59.853 --> 07:03.456
means that I will never
touch food of any kind again,

07:03.490 --> 07:05.425
you'll just have to
pick it up yourself.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.127
Sissy.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.096
I don't get where this
is coming from.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.764
Well, what am I
supposed to think?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.800
Well, how could say
I'm using you?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.802
You don't care
about what I think.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.435
You don't ask about my day.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.305
You really did turn into
a real girl, didn't you?

07:18.338 --> 07:20.273
See? And you make
jokes during my pain.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.442
You don't care
about me at all.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.276
I care about you.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.980
How much?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.682
What do I mean to you?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.783
I...

07:30.817 --> 07:34.254
We, you know, we spend...

07:34.286 --> 07:37.124
We'll talk about it later.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.526
Well, I think we should
talk about it now.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.596
Thank you for
knocking.
If you don't know
how I feel about...

07:42.629 --> 07:45.098
I don't. This isn't
a relationship.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.466
You don't need me.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.536
All you care about
is lots of orgasms.

07:52.471 --> 07:56.810
Okay, remember how we talked
about private conversations?

07:56.843 --> 07:58.978
How they're less private when
they're in front of my friends?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.112
SPIKE:
Oh, we're not
your friends.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.449
Go on.
Please don't.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.651
This is important.
Yes, but why is it here?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.452
Mom said you wanted me
to swing by.

08:06.485 --> 08:09.856
Oh, well, yes.
Well, I meant, uh, after sunset.

08:09.889 --> 08:13.894
Um, I need you to take
Spike for a few days.
What?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.295
What?
What?

08:15.327 --> 08:17.129
I'm not staying with him.
I have

08:17.163 --> 08:19.832
a friend who's coming to town,
and I'd like us to be alone.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.334
Oh, you mean an orgasm friend?

08:22.369 --> 08:24.204
Yes, that's exactly
the most appalling thing

08:24.237 --> 08:26.673
you could've said.
He's not roaming around.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.675
If he stays with me,
he's gonna get tied up again.
What about us,

08:28.709 --> 08:30.076
our romantic evening?
SPIKE:
I'm not having
these two shag

08:30.110 --> 08:31.711
while I'm tied to a
chair three feet away.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.046
XANDER:
That's not exactly
one of my fantasies, either.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.413
ANYA:
So you're blowing off
our evening

08:34.447 --> 08:36.082
because you don't...
Well, you better have cable,

08:36.115 --> 08:37.484
'cause I'm not missing...
I don't want him to come over.

08:37.517 --> 08:41.488
We come together,
daughters of Gaia,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.155
sisters to the moon.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.494
We walk with the darkness,

08:47.527 --> 08:51.163
the wolf at our side,
through the waterfall

08:51.197 --> 08:55.067
of power, to the blackest
heart of eternity.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.838
I think
we should have a bake sale.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.941
I don't know.
You guys like
a bake sale,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.509
right? I mean, we need
money for the dance recital,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.846
and you know
I do an empowering lemon Bundt.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.346
WOMAN:
The most important thing

09:07.379 --> 09:09.048
is the Gaia newsletter.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.519
We need to get the message
of blessing out to the sisters.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.386
Also, who left
their scented candles

09:14.421 --> 09:16.389
dripping all over
my woman-power shrine?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.525
Well, this is... good.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.094
I mean, this is all fun.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.196
You know? But

09:23.230 --> 09:26.466
there's also other stuff that
we might show an interest in

09:26.499 --> 09:28.268
as a Wicca group.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.403
Like what?

09:31.904 --> 09:35.075
Well, there's the wacky notion
of spells.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.309
You know, conjuring,
transmutation.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.879
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.713
Then we could all
get on our broomsticks

09:40.748 --> 09:42.750
and fly around
on our broomsticks.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.884
(laughter)
You know, certain
stereotypes

09:44.918 --> 09:46.653
are not very empowering.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.056
I think that...
WOMAN:
One person's energy can

09:49.088 --> 09:51.892
suck the power
from an entire circle.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.595
No offense.
Well, maybe we could...

09:55.629 --> 09:57.429
Yeah? Tara? Guys,

09:57.463 --> 09:59.932
quiet. Do you have a suggestion?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.408
Okay. Let's talk about
the theme for the Bacchanal.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.144
So not stellar, huh?

10:12.178 --> 10:15.347
Talk. All talk.
Blah, blah, Gaia.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.850
Blah, blah, moon.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.451
Menstrual life
force power thingy.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.187
You know, after
a couple sessions,

10:21.221 --> 10:24.024
I was hoping we would get
into something real, but...

10:24.057 --> 10:26.525
No actual witches
in your witch group?

10:26.558 --> 10:30.029
No. Bunch of
wanna-blessed-bes.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.932
You know,
nowadays, every girl

10:31.965 --> 10:34.267
with a henna tattoo
and a spice rack

10:34.301 --> 10:36.635
thinks she's a sister
of the dark ones.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.370
I'm sorry it was a bust.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.974
I know you were looking to go
further in that department.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.609
I'd just like to
float something bigger

10:42.642 --> 10:44.211
than a pencil some day.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.713
Hey, how's with
you and Riley?

10:46.746 --> 10:50.350
You two seemed pretty
snugly after class.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.452
See above re: talk. All talk.

10:53.485 --> 10:55.889
Do I have to tie
you two together?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.191
We almost, but...

10:58.225 --> 11:01.894
Well, get with it. I need
my vicarious smoochies.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.364
I don't know.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.232
I get nervous,
and I start babbling,

11:06.265 --> 11:09.402
and he starts babbling,
and it's a babble fest.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.504
Plus, every time we talk,
I have to lie.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.475
The slayer thing comes up
one way or another.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.345
I wish I could just come clean.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.181
Well, you can't.
Yeah, I know I can't.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.149
But it bugs me this time.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.384
This is the burden
we bear, brother.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.822
We have a gig that would
inevitably cause any girl living

11:28.855 --> 11:30.590
to think we are
cool upon cool.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.360
Yet, we must Clark Kent our
way through the dating scene,

11:33.393 --> 11:36.596
never to use our
unfair advantage.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.398
Thank God we're pretty.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.900
But it's just, you know,
Buffy's special.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.601
You think she's special?

11:42.634 --> 11:46.239
Wow, first 486 times you
told me, it didn't register,

11:46.273 --> 11:49.076
but now I see that
you think she's special.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.278
See? You're naturally inclined
to talk too much.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.946
I don't have that.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.413
Then get with the kissing.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.615
WOMAN (over P.A.):
...access variable...

11:56.649 --> 11:58.518
Riley Finn.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.955
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Initiative vocal code
match complete.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.456
I don't see why
I have to be tied up.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.125
It's just while I'm sleeping.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.628
Like I'd bite
you, anyway.

12:08.660 --> 12:12.032
Oh, you would.
Not bloody likely.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.967
I happen to be
very biteable, pal.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.804
I'm moist and delicious.
All right.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.740
Yeah, fine.
You're a nummy treat.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.743
And don't you forget it.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.816
(in high-pitched voice):
Xander, don't you care about me?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.250
Shut up.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.220
We never talk.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.455
Shut up!

12:35.488 --> 12:38.225
(sing-songy):
Xan-der.
Shut up!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.827
"They need to take seven."

12:42.495 --> 12:45.498
Take seven what?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.934
(knock on door)

12:51.671 --> 12:53.907
Olivia. Here.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.442
Sorry I'm so late.
The flight was a horror.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.245
Oh, no. Bad weather?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.779
Baseball movie.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.015
Oh. I'm so sorry.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.153
Yeah. That's enough small talk,
don't you think?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.500
(crickets chirping)

13:22.534 --> 13:26.038
(rhythmic clicking)

13:31.211 --> 13:34.713

Vocal code not accepted.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.540
Unauthorized beings
will be considered hostile.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.276
Please commence
vocal identification

17:23.309 --> 17:26.377
in the next 20 seconds
to avoid countermeasures.

17:26.413 --> 17:30.016
(beeping)

17:30.048 --> 17:32.852
Override code incorrect.

17:32.884 --> 17:35.122
(touch tones sounding)

17:37.056 --> 17:39.625
Lethal countermeasures engaged.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.751
(fingers snapping)

19:45.785 --> 19:48.820
MAN (on TV):
We have this breaking news item
from Sunnydale, California.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.589
Apparently, the entire town
has been quarantined

19:50.623 --> 19:52.259
due to an epidemic of--
as strange

19:52.291 --> 19:54.693
as this may sound-- laryngitis.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.330
It seems the town has been
rendered unable to speak.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.199
There's no word yet
what might have caused this

20:00.232 --> 20:02.269
or what other effects might be
seen from this epidemic.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.871
Local authorities have
issued a statement--

20:04.903 --> 20:06.673
a written statement,
I should say--

20:06.705 --> 20:08.575
blaming recent flu vaccinations.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.411
A few skeptics call it
a citywide hoax.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.913
In the meanwhile, Sunnydale
has effectively shut down.

20:13.945 --> 20:17.182
All schools and businesses will
be closed for the time being.

20:17.215 --> 20:20.086
And residents are advised
to stay home and rest up.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.688
The Centers for Disease Control

20:21.721 --> 20:24.022
have ordered the entire town
quarantined.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.892
No one can go in or out

20:25.924 --> 20:29.060
until the syndrome is identified
or the symptoms disappear.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.664
We'll bring you more on that
as it develops.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.640
MALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
 Because there will

20:40.673 --> 20:42.541
be chaos.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.809
You will help keep order.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.077
Dress as civilians.

20:46.112 --> 20:49.080
A military presence
would only increase panic.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.759
We are looking into it.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.095
Go. Help maintain order.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.765
We will find an answer.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.234
(bones crack,
metal clanking)

21:55.748 --> 21:59.050

MAN:
At the research library.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.586
WILLOW:
 You were there looking for me?

40:55.621 --> 40:57.755
I thought maybe
we could do a spell,

40:57.789 --> 41:00.125
make people talk again.

41:00.157 --> 41:02.293
I-I'd seen you
in the-the group,

41:02.327 --> 41:04.695
the W-Wicca group.

41:06.697 --> 41:09.835
You were... you were
different than them.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.670
I mean, they didn't
seem to know...

41:11.702 --> 41:14.905
What they were talking about?

41:16.173 --> 41:19.443
I think if they saw a witch,

41:19.476 --> 41:22.313
(laughing):
they would, um,
run the other way.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.349
How long have you
been practicing?

41:25.382 --> 41:29.788
Always. I mean,
since I, um, was little.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.956
My-my mom used to.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.559
She, um...

41:34.893 --> 41:37.862
She had a lot of power,
like you.

41:37.896 --> 41:42.668
Oh, I'm not... I... I don't have
much in the way of power.

41:42.701 --> 41:48.505
Really. I mean, most
of my potions come out... soup.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.474
Besides, spells going awry,

41:50.507 --> 41:53.077
friends in danger.

41:53.110 --> 41:55.480
I'm definitely nothing special.

41:55.512 --> 41:57.682
No, you are.

42:05.056 --> 42:11.528
So, would you say this was,
um, your best visit ever?

42:11.563 --> 42:14.231
All the time
you used to talk to me

42:14.264 --> 42:16.735
about witchcraft and darkness
and the like--

42:16.768 --> 42:19.670
I just thought
you were being pretentious.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.572
Oh, I was.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.708
I was also right.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.744
So everything
you told me was true?

42:28.914 --> 42:31.016
Well, no, um, I
wasn't actually

42:31.048 --> 42:34.452
one of the original members
of Pink Floyd, but...

42:34.485 --> 42:36.887
about the monster stuff, yes.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.324
Scary.

42:40.557 --> 42:42.427
Too scary?

42:42.460 --> 42:44.829
I don't know.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.902
(indistinct chatter)

42:51.936 --> 42:53.704
(knocking)

42:53.739 --> 42:56.141
Hi.

42:56.173 --> 42:58.844
Hi.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.527
Well...

43:19.530 --> 43:21.833
I guess we have to talk.

43:26.804 --> 43:29.206
I guess we do.

44:24.762 --> 44:27.231
Grr. Argh.
