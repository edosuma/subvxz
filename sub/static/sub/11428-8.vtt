Caribou, that's
a good sign. They're not
always here this time of year.

00:29.033 --> 00:31.467
Sometimes they don't show up
for months from now.

00:31.733 --> 00:35.100

00:36.033 --> 00:38.333
They can be here one day
and gone the next.

if I can intercept some.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.233
This could be my chance today.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.433
Typically, caribou make up
about half the meat
I eat in a year.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.767
They could show up now,

00:50.833 --> 00:52.333
and I might not see another
caribou for months.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.233
Those caribou
are a few miles away.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.400
There might be caribou
down lower in the trees,

00:57.700 --> 00:59.300
easier to get to.

Some of these caribou
look like

01:01.433 --> 01:02.767
they're coming down
into the forest.

01:02.833 --> 01:05.100
I got to get over there and
see if I can intercept them.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.900
Caribou, they're moving
through the area.

01:10.533 --> 01:13.067
They're big migrators,
and they travel long ways.

01:14.233 --> 01:16.233
They can be here one day
and gone the next,

01:16.300 --> 01:19.067

I have to go out,
try to intercept them.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.633
because it's time to cut
an overland trail in,

to bypass a really bad
part of a side river.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.500

I'm surrounded

05:33.567 --> 05:36.133
by the Yukon River
on three sides.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.900
So I have trail that goes
from my house,

05:38.967 --> 05:41.100
over the mountain range,
to the Yukon.

05:41.267 --> 05:43.733
But what I need to do is
I need to put a trail in

05:43.800 --> 05:45.400
that goes over the mountains,

05:45.967 --> 05:47.667
follows the base
of the mountains,

05:47.733 --> 05:50.167
and then ties into one
of these bends in the river.

05:50.233 --> 05:53.533
Because this whole section
from here to here,

05:53.600 --> 05:57.200
which is about three and a
half miles, is really bad ice.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.167
Every one of these bends is
very difficult to get around,

06:01.233 --> 06:02.900
and by putting this trail in,

06:02.967 --> 06:05.400
this is gonna allow me
to travel on safer ice,

06:05.467 --> 06:07.967
and get me into better dog
mushing territory

in one direction,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.333
and four miles
in another direction.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.700

he must be mindful of the type
of caribou he pursues,

in making
the Balm of Gilead...

18:40.400 --> 18:41.600
That's where it's stored.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.467

I take all these little buds,

lots of medicine,

19:18.800 --> 19:19.867
Didn't care for that much.

Got to Alaska,

To buy a similar product
in town, is about 15 bucks.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.000
package it,
get it on an aeroplane,

19:59.067 --> 20:01.067
and then $1,200
to bring it out.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.867
So for around $1,500

20:03.933 --> 20:06.733
I could get a product that
won't work as good
as what I can make.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.700

a price tag on it.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.367
balsam poplar branches

20:17.433 --> 20:18.933
so I have an
opportunity to see

20:19.000 --> 20:20.467

20:20.533 --> 20:22.267

some money and add on.

Stop.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.667
Basically what we're gonna do
is take this tent frame
to Emonakrov and put it on its

20:48.733 --> 20:50.200
post foundation
that we built for it.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.100
Now that the ice
is thick enough,
it's a good time to travel

hundred pounds

the roof behind.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.733
We were trying to be
optimistic and load it up

21:14.800 --> 21:16.967
with as much as we could
for a one-shot go,

21:17.033 --> 21:18.667
but it weighs too much,

21:18.733 --> 21:20.933
so we're gonna leave the
smaller parts behind and
just make a second trip.

but it's what we gotta do.

the beach there wouldn't be
a problem for them to bring.

they get around the roads.

bring a lot more,

21:46.667 --> 21:48.000
but we had to lighten
the load.

21:48.067 --> 21:50.833
We had to be realistic
about our time,
our gas mileage,

21:50.900 --> 21:53.400
and the ability that we have
with these machines
to do that stuff.

from where it was,

22:18.900 --> 22:22.300

to do the whole journey

on that I needed his help.

I'm glad you turned back.

23:00.433 --> 23:01.933
Is that coolant?

23:02.233 --> 23:03.333
Oh, man.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.700
I stopped 'cause I'm always
looking back,

quite a while,

23:06.833 --> 23:07.967

So after you give somebody
about 10 minutes,

if they haven't got it
figured out you kind of
go back for 'em.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.433
I went back here, she's got
coolant all over the ground.

23:14.933 --> 23:18.600
I was just wondering if you
had just doubled up
and kept going, or else...

23:18.667 --> 23:20.133
Um, because we're
almost here.

-Finish the delivery.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.233
We'll go deliver this thing,

with at least one strap,

you home tonight.
-Yeah.

an extra hand here.

I'm gonna be needing
the hand to get back home.

gonna have the time today

23:38.667 --> 23:41.000
to stop and erect everything,
but that's all right.

23:41.067 --> 23:43.833
It adds an extra day to what
we want to be doing,
but we're the kind of people

23:43.900 --> 23:45.767
that can put out
that extra day.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.933
Turned out better
than I thought, actually.

23:59.667 --> 24:01.567
And this got here
in one piece.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.433
Albeit a little shaky,
but we'll reinforce it again.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.533
Just because we're a snow
machine down

24:07.600 --> 24:09.100
don't mean we can't finish
up with what we started.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.533
We finished the job,
now we go back

24:13.600 --> 24:15.600
and go start a new,
unexpected job.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.567
Little bit of mechanic-ing.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.967

long enough.

I'm gonna grab one
of these longer dudes.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.400
There's a lot of
good ones on here.

24:59.167 --> 25:02.167
This is my balsam poplar wood
that I harvested yesterday,

25:02.233 --> 25:05.900
and now the task at hand is
to get all the little buds off

25:05.967 --> 25:07.667
and turn that into medicine.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.000
I've just got to squeeze it,
and look at all that
coming out.

25:15.367 --> 25:18.067
Balm of Gilead has been
around for eons.

25:20.033 --> 25:22.100
The medicinal value of it,

25:22.167 --> 25:24.667
what I need, is to make a balm

25:24.733 --> 25:26.600
so I can put it on my
sore muscles and joints.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.100
I had a tremendous amount
of surgeries and work done,

25:29.167 --> 25:32.300
and I'm in my mid-50s
living in a very
brutally cold climate.

25:32.367 --> 25:36.067
This is, hopefully, gonna
keep me limber enough
to keep my lifestyle going.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.900
Pour it in here.

25:40.967 --> 25:42.667
Then, I'm gonna take oil...

25:44.767 --> 25:47.567
All of the resins
those little clumpings have,

25:47.633 --> 25:49.500
I want to leach it out
into the oil.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.567
I can use it as an
oil treatment,

25:53.933 --> 25:55.867
but I prefer a salve, a cream.

25:56.633 --> 25:58.100
This is my bees' wax.

26:03.033 --> 26:06.133
There we go.
Now you can see that
nice amber colour.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.300
This is the salve
that I'm after.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.000
Right there,
you see the scar line.

26:12.233 --> 26:14.333
You know, it hurts
like hell through here.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.033
But, um...

26:16.200 --> 26:18.433
This is gonna help me sleep
and get me through this.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.733
And get me through it,
with a smile instead
of a tear.

26:26.567 --> 26:29.267
ANDY: I always say that
the best way to learn
something is to screw up.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.933
You'll remember that
lesson really well.

26:45.833 --> 26:48.967
I'm gonna use the machine
as much as I can
to break the trail out.

26:50.367 --> 26:53.567
Snow machines have gotten
bigger, stronger, heavier.

26:53.633 --> 26:55.767
And that allows you to do
a lot more work with them.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.900
You can use it
like a bulldozer

26:58.967 --> 27:02.167
to plough over a bunch
of these smaller spruce trees.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.567
Like that.

Andy must break a new
overland trail through
the rough terrain.

27:19.033 --> 27:21.567
ANDY: When I cut a trail,
I like to cut it wide,

27:22.067 --> 27:23.967
because I don't want it
to grow in.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.467
Whoa!
That one's a little too big.

27:29.967 --> 27:32.333
It saves a lot of time
cutting trees,

27:32.400 --> 27:35.633
but every now and then
you got to take time
to clear 'em out, too.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.800
This is gonna be a big
time-saver once it's in,

27:39.867 --> 27:41.567
and it's gonna pay off
for many years,

27:41.633 --> 27:43.500
and if I do a good job
on this,

27:43.567 --> 27:45.633
then I'm not gonna have
to think about
cutting this trail again

27:45.700 --> 27:47.033
probably for the rest
of my life.

27:49.533 --> 27:50.967
Yeah, I'm starting to
open up here,

27:51.033 --> 27:53.133
so this is good.
I see a really nice,

27:53.200 --> 27:54.933
natural little opening
right here,

27:55.033 --> 27:57.000
so I'm gonna follow that
as long as I can

27:57.067 --> 27:58.433
and take advantage of that.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.733
Yeah, I like this.
This is good.
Good going here.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.567
It's not as dense as I thought
it was gonna be.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.767
(CRASHING)

28:16.867 --> 28:17.867
Whoa!

28:18.933 --> 28:20.800
Yeah, that one's big.

28:22.367 --> 28:25.700
I'm going through,
I see a skinny,
little top like that,

28:25.767 --> 28:28.433
but, I thought
I could bust it out

28:28.500 --> 28:31.200
but it looks like there's
a big stump underneath of it.

28:31.900 --> 28:34.267
So, you know, busting trail,
you're gonna hit things,

28:34.333 --> 28:36.067
you're gonna turn
snow machines over.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.867
(GRUNTS)

28:40.033 --> 28:42.333
And sometimes you just got
to grunt and groan

28:42.400 --> 28:45.767
to get that 650 pounds
right back up where
it's supposed to be.

28:45.833 --> 28:48.967
If you can't turn it back
over, it's a long walk home.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Whew!

28:56.233 --> 28:57.933
So I've come
to the conclusion,

28:58.067 --> 29:01.000
when I get too old
to turn this damn
machine over by myself,

29:01.133 --> 29:03.167
that's when it's time
to slow down a little bit.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.300
(LAUGHS)

29:04.667 --> 29:06.333
It's a labour of love
when you're out here.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.067
It's all a part of
creating the world
that you want to live in.

29:10.133 --> 29:13.167
I don't want to go crashing
through the trees
when I'm 70 years old,

29:13.233 --> 29:16.967
and I don't want to be
dealing with bad ice
when I'm 70 years old.

29:17.067 --> 29:20.267
So I'm putting the time
in right now so that
when I get older,

29:20.400 --> 29:23.400
I'm still gonna enjoy myself
and I'm still gonna
be able to get out.

29:23.633 --> 29:26.267
And this trail's gonna
provide that access to me,

29:26.333 --> 29:29.433
and provide the opportunity
for me to continue
to get out there.

29:29.533 --> 29:33.367
Yee-haw! All right,
now the real work begins.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.867
These trees are way
too big to knock down
with a snow machine,

29:39.933 --> 29:43.533
so it's time to break out
the manual labour tool

29:44.300 --> 29:47.100
and start cutting
trail with this.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.400
Still got another hour
or so of daylight.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.333
(MOTOR WHIRS)

29:52.400 --> 29:53.833
Try and take
full advantage of that.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.467
(CHAINSAW BUZZING)

29:56.767 --> 29:59.033
Everything I do
out here is work.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.000
There's nothing easy
about getting out
in the woods out here.

30:03.700 --> 30:06.133
Cutting trees. Throwing 'em
out of the way.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.400
Handling the chainsaw.
It's all a lot of work.

30:09.533 --> 30:12.267
At the time, sometimes these
jobs feel kind of arduous,

30:12.833 --> 30:15.133
and, like your
never-ending projects.

30:15.233 --> 30:16.567
But when you get it all done,

30:17.100 --> 30:19.900
all you can think about is,
"Man, thank God I did this."

30:20.133 --> 30:22.800
And I'll be saying that for
many years to come now.

30:22.967 --> 30:24.467
Little timber!

30:26.767 --> 30:27.933
(CRASHING)

30:33.633 --> 30:36.833
It's starting to open up.
I can see the mountain
on the other side.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.967
Hooey!

30:42.700 --> 30:45.367
Fire going, warm my
hands up a little bit.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.033
So, I'm gonna get
a little food.

30:50.033 --> 30:54.467
This is just some moose
sausage that I made up
this fall after I got a moose,

30:55.233 --> 30:58.667
and I find it's one
of the better things for
me to bring out here.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.467
It's got a lot of fat in it,
it's a lot of good calories.

31:01.567 --> 31:04.167
Puts the energy
back into you. Mmm.

31:04.967 --> 31:06.733
That's some good
stuff there, boy.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.367
I also like to bring
a thermos full of soup.

31:11.133 --> 31:13.867
Mmm-mmm, this entire meal
came from right here.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.800
The vegetables
came from my garden.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.467
The sausage came from a moose.

31:23.033 --> 31:24.667
The water came from
the Yukon River.

31:28.267 --> 31:32.233
It's all good stuff. Mmm-mmm.

31:34.067 --> 31:36.833
Everything you need
to live out in the country
is out there for you.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.700
You just got to know
what it is and how to use it.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.900
The sun's set below
the mountains.

31:43.967 --> 31:46.367
It's gonna start getting dark
pretty quick here.

31:46.433 --> 31:50.467
I got a lot done.
And I'm feeling really good
about the progress I got.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.500
I can see the light.
It's lightening up
through the forest here,

31:53.567 --> 31:55.133
so I know I'm getting
close to the river.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.800
I think I'll call it day,
and, uh, come back
with the dogs tomorrow.

32:01.100 --> 32:04.467
Whoa! This is a nice trail,
look at this.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.100
Take that! Ah!

32:14.133 --> 32:16.733
CHIP: Hunting, camping,
a lot of action,
a lot of good food,

32:16.800 --> 32:18.367
a lot of good pride
in what you're doing.

32:18.433 --> 32:21.400
Not the rich in money life,
but the healthy life.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.833
Oh, it's getting cold.

32:28.933 --> 32:31.100
Well, you know today's goal,
right now, is uh...

32:31.167 --> 32:34.367
Since we have
the frame for the tent
down at Emonakrov,

32:34.600 --> 32:36.100
we want to get the roof
to it down there.

32:36.167 --> 32:37.933
It takes more than one load
to get this stuff done.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.533
This will be our
third load down.

32:39.633 --> 32:41.467
We'll be doubling up
on my ride today,

32:41.533 --> 32:45.267
'cause hers is busted,
and hopefully we'll get the
roof down to Emonakrov

32:45.333 --> 32:46.933
and onto the tent frame
that's waiting for us.

32:47.067 --> 32:49.133
You know, when you're
doing like almost
a 90-mile round trip,

32:49.367 --> 32:50.967
it can be most of your day.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.567
Now that my wife has
title to the property,
this'll be permanent.

32:53.633 --> 32:56.033
Then we won't have
to come home.
It'll save a lot of gas,

32:56.133 --> 32:59.300
it'll save a lot of our time.
We can wake up down
there in the morning,

32:59.367 --> 33:01.400
and just go fishing
without having to drive
an hour and a half.

33:02.267 --> 33:04.800
I got a lot to look
forward to, now I just
got to get this done.

33:08.967 --> 33:11.467
-Oh.
-That was a bumpy ride eh?

33:11.533 --> 33:13.033
That was a bumpy ride.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.733
Tonight, we'll go home
with nothing on the sled.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.267
To us, this is just
the beginning.

33:16.333 --> 33:18.167
We have the plan
to develop this place.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.267
You know, we're taking it
as we can afford it.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.433
So, this is what
we can afford.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.400
It's gonna be a tent,
it's gonna be a start.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.333
We'll start by getting
that up there after
we have a roof on it. (LAUGHS)

33:30.600 --> 33:33.700
AGNES: Trying to work
as fast as we can,
doing whatever we could

33:33.767 --> 33:35.700
before it gets dark,
we just have a few hours left.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.900
CHIP:
There's lots to be done here.
There's caches to be made.

33:39.967 --> 33:42.233
There's nets to be brought.
This is just the start.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.800
There we go.

33:47.867 --> 33:49.767
What I want to do
is I want to lift this up,

33:49.833 --> 33:52.067
and then we'll just see
if we can get it to
tip forward here.

33:52.167 --> 33:53.633
One, two, three, up!

33:54.733 --> 33:56.533
(GRUNTS)

34:05.033 --> 34:07.133
One, two, three, up!

34:07.533 --> 34:09.167
(GRUNTS)

34:10.567 --> 34:12.300
Okay, stop! Stop! Stop!

34:13.467 --> 34:14.467
Okay, there we go.

34:17.633 --> 34:20.433
(GRUNTS)
Okay.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.500
Wow! And that's our roof.

34:22.733 --> 34:24.600
What we need to do now
is put canvas around it.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.200
-CHIP: Is it looking good?
-It's looking awesome.
Looks like a tent frame.

34:30.267 --> 34:33.200
CHIP: We're gonna get it
up here on the frame
that we built this last fall,

34:33.400 --> 34:34.967
and this'll be the very
beginning of a camp.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.433
And when we drive
out of here tonight,

34:36.500 --> 34:38.100
we can say we have
another camp.

34:38.167 --> 34:40.700
We own other pieces
of property, and on each
piece of property

34:40.767 --> 34:42.533
we like to put a little
something permanent,

34:42.600 --> 34:44.700
because if we have that
piece of property,
there's a reason to be there.

34:45.067 --> 34:47.233
And if there's a reason
to be there, then there's
a reason to stay.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.533
And this'll be the place
where we stay.

34:51.333 --> 34:52.767
AGNES:
You got to go straight.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.500
CHIP:
One, two, three!

34:54.567 --> 34:56.167
Okay, that's great.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.667
This willow's my anchor.
We call him a dead man,

34:58.733 --> 35:00.267
he ain't going
nowhere, hopefully.

35:00.433 --> 35:03.467
And it's basically
what you have
in the ground,

35:03.533 --> 35:07.133
to be able to
lift or move or pull against.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.267
Uphill.

35:11.967 --> 35:13.833
I like your cool tool.

35:14.033 --> 35:18.433
Yeah. This come-along
was the best 45 bucks
I spent last fall.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.600
It's coming up.

35:21.767 --> 35:23.333
(GRUNTS)

35:28.400 --> 35:29.900
It's coming over.

35:33.167 --> 35:34.567
Whoa!

35:34.633 --> 35:35.633
Just tie it off.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.567
There we go.

35:38.633 --> 35:40.367
Now, hold that while
I take care of this.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.467
That's called
averting disaster.

wants to fall off.

AGNES: That was easier
than I thought, though.

36:14.767 --> 36:16.800
Okay! Right there.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.933
That's it. That is it, it, it!

36:20.033 --> 36:21.633
Well, we got it all done.

36:21.733 --> 36:23.467
We wanted to get this done.
This was something
that was on our list

36:23.533 --> 36:24.533
before light winter comes.

36:25.133 --> 36:27.200
AGNES: It's all working
together and I'm so glad

36:27.267 --> 36:30.200
my husband could, you know,
come up with this great idea

36:30.267 --> 36:33.067
of a sled with
a tent frame on it.

36:33.133 --> 36:35.500
I really like it.
You did a real good job.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.833
CHIP: Well, you know,
my wife got the
title to this property.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.200
So, we put in these posts
when the water was still

36:40.267 --> 36:41.567
flowing and we could
use a boat.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.333
Then, while the freeze-up
was going on

36:43.400 --> 36:45.333
and we were all stuck
at home waiting for
the ice to thicken,

36:45.400 --> 36:47.467
I built this frame. And when
the ice was thick enough,

36:47.533 --> 36:49.900
we drug it down here on a
nice, clean, smooth river.

36:49.967 --> 36:52.733
And we were able to
jack it up to the posts here,

36:52.800 --> 36:55.567
and here we are permanently.
It's kind of crazy.

36:55.767 --> 36:58.800
AGNES: Wow! Nice, eh?
CHIP: Nice with the lights on.

36:59.100 --> 37:02.933
The white canvas idea
is a good idea to make
it bright in here.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.633
Yep. It'll make it bright
and this place will hold
heat really well, too.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.067
The thing that we need
to do is put in a stove,

37:07.133 --> 37:09.233
and we'll put in a bed,
and all our other stuff.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.767
But, you know,
having it up here and
secure on the platform

37:11.833 --> 37:13.300
is more important
than anything else.

37:13.367 --> 37:15.800
Because no matter
what happens now,
the whole thing is safe

37:15.867 --> 37:18.567
and the rush is over
and the big part's done.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.367
-The structure is here,
and that's what counts.
-Yep.

37:21.967 --> 37:24.567
-Shall we make
our way out of here?
-We shall.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.033
-CHIP: Man! That day's
go by quick, huh?
-Yeah.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.900
I think we all need a rest.

37:31.533 --> 37:33.933
ANDY:
If you're afraid to work,
you don't belong out here.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.433
If you don't like being tired
at the end of the day,
you don't belong out here.

37:42.433 --> 37:44.333
(DOGS BARKING)

37:53.133 --> 37:54.833
You guys want to go
for a run today?

37:57.867 --> 37:59.533
I need a kiss-kiss.
(MAKES KISSING SOUNDS)

38:00.467 --> 38:04.000
Little more, little more,
you missed.
There you go.

38:05.133 --> 38:08.267
So today, we're gonna go
finish cutting a bypass trail,

38:08.433 --> 38:10.933
and hopefully I can finish
cutting that trail today

38:11.000 --> 38:12.867
and then we can really
take advantage of it.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.167
It's gonna be a lot of hard
work to put this trail in,

38:17.400 --> 38:20.533
but it's gonna pay
dividends to me for the
rest of my life out here.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.433
It's gonna open up
a whole new section
of the country for me.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.733
A lot of work ahead
of us today, Tobe.

38:34.333 --> 38:37.833

excited to go for a run today!

38:40.233 --> 38:43.700

38:43.767 --> 38:47.300
These dogs are my world, and
that's why I'm doing the work
I'm doing here,

38:47.367 --> 38:49.667
is to get better access so
I can get them in shape.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.767
Atta boys!

39:04.533 --> 39:07.433
This is why I'm trying to
put this bypass trail in,

39:07.500 --> 39:11.867
this overland trail in, so I
can avoid the Yukon River
early in the year,

39:11.933 --> 39:14.067
and I can avoid it on years
when it's really rough.

39:15.300 --> 39:18.167
This is a really tough year
because we don't
have much snow,

39:18.233 --> 39:19.900
and we have really rough ice.

39:21.500 --> 39:25.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy!
Guys, watch the cracks.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.033
Easy.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.600
When you're out on
the jumble ice,
it's really intense.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.467
You get pounded really hard.

39:40.433 --> 39:43.633
It's really difficult
for a musher to stay
on the back of a sled

39:43.767 --> 39:45.267
because when you're
dealing with ice,

39:45.367 --> 39:46.700
the longer you stand
in one place,

39:46.933 --> 39:48.900
the more chance
the ice will give out on you.

39:50.233 --> 39:52.100
Probably your best friend
is some speed.

39:56.700 --> 39:59.867
Straight ahead. Up and over.
Up and over.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.333
You guys take a break
here for a while.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.333
It's my turn to work.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.833
Strip down a little bit,
so I don't get too hot.

40:20.033 --> 40:21.467
Here's where I finished
cutting trail.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.767
So we'll just grab
that chainsaw
and start whacking again.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.900
(CHAINSAW BUZZING)

40:28.633 --> 40:32.833
This section down in here,
the snow's pretty darn deep.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.267
So, it's been a bit of work
to get through these
woods here.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.433
So, a lot of calories.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.833
A lot of cutting.
A lot of throwing.

40:41.333 --> 40:44.033
My total trail here is
probably about three miles.

40:45.367 --> 40:48.400
That's cutting off
over six miles of travel,

40:48.467 --> 40:50.400
and four miles
on really bad river.

40:54.733 --> 40:55.767
I'm feeling good.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.733
Tired, but good.

40:58.033 --> 40:59.667
I busted out the trail.

40:59.767 --> 41:01.033
I made my connection.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.667
So, the only thing left to do

41:02.767 --> 41:05.667
is pick up that nice
hard trail and head on home.

41:05.733 --> 41:07.833
I'm feeling really good
about all this.

41:08.167 --> 41:11.633
It's been a lot of work,
but it's gonna pay off
for years to come.

41:11.733 --> 41:14.267
Hup! Up easy. Hup, hup!

41:16.167 --> 41:17.167
Atta boys!

41:26.200 --> 41:28.600
GLENN: You look out
the window, and hey, there's
something to do.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.400
This isn't just routine.

41:30.467 --> 41:32.867
It's always new,
it's always changing,
it's always beautiful, too.

41:40.567 --> 41:41.767
(SIGHS)

41:42.167 --> 41:43.767
Made it back to camp.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.233
(EXHALES)
Long day.

41:50.767 --> 41:52.533
Yeah.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.433
Okay, got my caribou home.

41:55.533 --> 41:56.767
This one's gonna be
good eating.

41:57.033 --> 41:58.433
A nice, young one.

41:58.667 --> 42:01.567
I was able to get it down
off the mountain in one trip.

42:01.733 --> 42:02.933
It's gonna be real tasty.

42:03.033 --> 42:04.167
It was a good, clean kill.

42:04.267 --> 42:06.233
Got the caribou,
got it back to camp.

42:08.367 --> 42:10.233
It's a lot of work
getting a caribou
down off the mountain.

42:10.367 --> 42:11.900
After I get home,
I like to eat some of it.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.700
Re-energise myself.

42:14.133 --> 42:16.733
I'm gonna cook up these
kidneys and a little liver.

42:19.533 --> 42:22.633
Wow, that's looking good.
I'm gonna put a little
rice in it.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.367
That looks delicious.
I love this stuff.

42:32.867 --> 42:34.200
Dinner is served.

42:35.667 --> 42:37.700
This year,
caribou showed up early.

42:37.767 --> 42:40.933
And it took some searching,
but I finally intercepted them
and I got myself a caribou.

42:41.033 --> 42:43.133
First caribou of the season,
that's always a good thing.

42:43.967 --> 42:44.967
Mmm.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.333
That's the first caribou I got
in about seven months.

42:50.633 --> 42:52.333
That's the way it is,
caribou come and go.

42:52.967 --> 42:54.633
They're not here
all year round.

42:55.733 --> 42:57.067
There's nothing like
being able to see

42:57.133 --> 42:59.033
where your food came from.
Right there on that mountain.

43:01.133 --> 43:02.467
This is the best food
in the world.

43:02.567 --> 43:04.600
Just to be able
to live out here
in the mountains like this

43:04.667 --> 43:07.400
and get food like this
up there myself,

43:08.567 --> 43:09.700
there's no other way
I'd rather live.

43:11.633 --> 43:12.667
That's tasty stuff.
