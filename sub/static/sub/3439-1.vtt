01:15.827 --> 01:20.098
Let's just take it from
the top, Mr. McCall.

01:27.005 --> 01:28.815
Mr. McCall?

01:29.841 --> 01:32.819
I told you, I didn't do it.

02:44.374 --> 02:47.143
Good night.

02:47.919 --> 02:49.312
Oh, fun for you.

02:49.379 --> 02:50.671
See you tomorrow.

02:50.672 --> 02:51.773
What?

02:51.881 --> 02:54.859
Good night. We'll clean up.
I love you.

03:53.318 --> 03:56.254
Whoa! Shit! Maverick, stop.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.547
Jesus Christ!

03:57.614 --> 04:00.591
- No, come on. Get off!
- You scared the shit out of me.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.553
Go away. Come on, buddy. Get out.

04:03.995 --> 04:05.763
You're not supposed
to see me tonight.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.156
Come on, that is a dumb tradition.
You don't believe it.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.269
- No, I don't believe it.
- Oh, shit, you do.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.438
Okay, I kind of do.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.005
What are you doing...

04:15.006 --> 04:16.940
- Okay, ready?
- Okay.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.902
Ladies, oop, and gentlemen...

04:19.969 --> 04:22.596
I'd like to present the McCalls.

04:23.681 --> 04:24.949
- Almost.
- Almost.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.643
- Okay, I gotta get dressed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.580
Strike that pose. Right there.

04:30.647 --> 04:33.791
I want to capture our
last night together.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.293
We're not dying.

04:35.777 --> 04:38.195
My dad used to follow us around
with one of these constantly.

04:38.196 --> 04:40.497
My mom gave him so
much shit for it.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.592
I think it's sweet.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.053
I wish I had something like that.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.472
My whole childhood
is kind of a blank.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.318
That's kind of why
I want to do this.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.583
I used to think my dad was so lame,

04:51.584 --> 04:54.437
with all his nostalgia
and all that.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.440
But I kind of get it now.

04:57.507 --> 05:00.651
I kind of want this for us.

05:01.678 --> 05:04.489
I just want a record of all the
important things that happen to us.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.057
And all the random stupid stuff
that we'll forget about.

05:07.058 --> 05:09.702
Mmm, yeah.

05:10.228 --> 05:14.332
Tomorrow, we are officially family.

05:14.399 --> 05:19.504
So, tonight I want to
start our family history.

05:20.697 --> 05:22.799
Family history.

05:23.408 --> 05:24.717
Yeah.

05:24.784 --> 05:26.677
I love that.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.679
Good.

05:42.719 --> 05:44.428
In sickness and in health.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.072
In sickness and in health.

05:46.139 --> 05:48.098
To love and to cherish.

05:48.099 --> 05:49.826
To love and to cherish.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.102
Till death do us part.

05:52.103 --> 05:54.330
Till death do us part.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.940
With this ring, I thee wed.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.835
With this ring, I thee wed.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.278
And pledge myself to thee forever.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.864
And pledge myself to thee forever.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.263
<i>Love me tender</i>

06:10.621 --> 06:13.832
<i>Love me true</i>

06:13.833 --> 06:18.563
<i>All my dreams fulfilled</i>

06:19.505 --> 06:20.922
Whoo!

06:20.923 --> 06:25.695
<i>For, my darling, I love you</i>

06:26.137 --> 06:31.409
I just wanted to say thank
you to Ken and Sally...

06:31.476 --> 06:33.452
for making me feel so at home.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.747
I've never really felt like
I was part of a family before.

06:36.814 --> 06:43.504
So, thank you for being so
welcoming and wonderful.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.073
Dad had the first camera.

06:46.074 --> 06:48.259
He'd carry it on
his shoulder like this.

06:48.326 --> 06:52.471
I wanted you to know that I think
you are a wonderful brother.

06:52.538 --> 06:56.475
I'm being serious! This
is a beautiful event...

06:56.542 --> 07:00.438
and I'm really grateful
that you invited me.

07:00.505 --> 07:03.858
We were in the same foster
home together for a year.

07:03.925 --> 07:07.278
And we were more
than friends. Family.

07:07.345 --> 07:09.780
I hope that you guys
will be happy forever.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.491
So, here's to happily ever after.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.161
Oh, gosh.

07:15.770 --> 07:16.954
Mmm.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.706
- Mmm.
- Are you okay?

07:37.375 --> 07:39.018
Sam...

07:39.418 --> 07:42.021
my beautiful wife.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.400
This was the most perfect day.

07:47.385 --> 07:50.363
I can't believe we're married.

07:53.099 --> 07:56.327
When we watch this
a lot of years from now...

07:56.394 --> 07:59.872
just remember how
good-looking I was.

08:03.401 --> 08:06.379
I love you so much.

08:06.445 --> 08:10.675
I promise I will
always protect you.

08:11.242 --> 08:13.678
Keep you safe.

08:15.955 --> 08:17.515
I love you.

08:17.874 --> 08:20.309
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

08:20.334 --> 08:23.062
<i>I'd like to welcome you
to the Dominican Republic.</i>

08:23.212 --> 08:25.297
This is gonna be awesome.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.289
- Now, the honeymoon begins.
- Ooh.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.749
Oh, wow!

08:45.193 --> 08:47.485
We're gonna do this
swimsuit issue-type thing.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.570
Oh, God!

08:48.571 --> 08:50.881
- No, no. You're gonna go in the water.
- Uh-huh.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.467
And then you're gonna
come out of the water.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.011
Is that how I'm gonna do it?

08:55.077 --> 08:56.679
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.599
Don't worry, I'm right behind you.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.201
- This is gonna go fast.
- No, it's not.

09:03.211 --> 09:04.854
Oh, my God.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.276
Christopher Columbus.

09:10.343 --> 09:11.635
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

09:11.636 --> 09:15.323
This is the first cathedral
in the New World.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.284
"The Cathedral of Santo Domingo."

09:18.643 --> 09:23.956
"It's Gothic style highlighted
with Renaissance details."

09:24.305 --> 09:25.649
Oh, my God.

09:25.650 --> 09:30.963
I have never seen anything so
fucking perfect before in my life.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.616
Look at this sea of white.
Oh, my gosh.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.762
What's that?

09:39.413 --> 09:43.434
That's my husband.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.436
Wake up.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.796
Hey.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.859
<i>Oogum, Oogum, Boogum,
Boogum, Boogum...</i>

09:51.926 --> 09:54.779
<i>Now, baby you're casting
your spell on me</i>

09:54.845 --> 09:58.949
<i>Your high heel boots
In your hip-huggin' suit</i>

09:59.016 --> 10:02.119
<i>You got it right
You're outta sight</i>

10:02.186 --> 10:03.371
What is that?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.021
It's the coolest
wedding present ever.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.333
Mason gave it to us.
It's an adventure cam.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.794
- Oh, good, that's what I always wanted.
- I know.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.962
And now we can go
zip-lining. Come on.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.632
Just get your game face on.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.117
All right.

10:17.118 --> 10:19.136
Hold on. Hold on!

10:28.254 --> 10:29.355
Wow.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.404
Where are we?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.537
Zach, come here.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.334
We're going here.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.588
Whoa. Come on.

10:54.739 --> 10:56.424
Hey, wait up, wait up.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.386
- Welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

11:00.453 --> 11:03.222
- Hi.
- Welcome.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.225
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.686
I will study your palm.

11:08.753 --> 11:10.378
Okay. Which one do you want?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.814
This one.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.090
I don't think it matters.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.277
I don't know. They're different.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.201
You've had some hard times.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.872
But now, you're so happy.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.191
- You're happy now.
- She's good.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.050
No family.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.055
No past.

11:55.007 --> 12:00.112
You were born from death.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.491
What do you mean?

12:04.141 --> 12:06.118
They've been waiting.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.286
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.448
- They've been waiting.
- Whoa.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.124
- They've been waiting.
- All right.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.292
Thank you. That's fine.

12:13.359 --> 12:14.919
- Whoa.
- They've been waiting.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.505
You are the first.
The first of many.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.173
You will bring the end.

12:19.490 --> 12:21.759
You know what? Let's go, let's go.

12:21.826 --> 12:22.867
Can we get out...

12:22.868 --> 12:24.160
- Ow! Ow!
- You were born from death.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.638
- Let go of me, please.
- Ma'am, let go.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.348
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

12:27.415 --> 12:29.517
- Zach, come on.
- Okay.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.604
Hey, are you okay?
What did she say to you?

12:33.671 --> 12:36.548
- Nothing. Fucking nothing. I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:36.549 --> 12:40.319
Hey. Forget her, okay?
She was crazy.

12:40.386 --> 12:41.820
What did she whisper in your ear?

12:41.887 --> 12:44.448
I don't know. It was just
a bunch of gibberish.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.326
She stank of rum anyway. I just
want to get back to the hotel.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.829
I don't remember
this street, do you?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.165
Do you wanna go down this way?

12:54.358 --> 12:56.293
Let's turn around.

12:59.238 --> 13:00.965
Okay.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.262
Jesus!

13:09.165 --> 13:10.766
Let's go.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.423
They don't have any street signs.

13:18.424 --> 13:20.717
Can we head back towards
where the party was?

13:22.052 --> 13:24.154
Do you guys need a taxi?

13:24.763 --> 13:26.323
- Are you are a taxi?
- Yeah.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.826
- That's your family?
<i>- Mi</i> family. Children. Babies.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.329
- Babies?
- Oh, no, not yet.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.323
- No?
- My new wife.

13:37.193 --> 13:39.403
I have lots of babies.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.839
- Yes, lots of babies.
- Someday. One day, yeah.

13:41.906 --> 13:46.050
I take you somewhere fun.
Eh... Fun, authentic.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.470
No, no, no. We're good. Thank you.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.556
We just want to go
back to the hotel.

13:50.623 --> 13:52.582
No, no, no. No worry.

13:52.583 --> 13:57.754
I'll wait for you outside. This place,
eh... Very distinctive. How do you say?

13:57.755 --> 13:58.838
It's special.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.120
- What do you think? One more drink?
- No.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.110
Come on. You're so young.

14:04.056 --> 14:06.198
- Twenty minutes.
- Twenty minutes.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.198
Twenty minutes?

14:08.265 --> 14:11.059
Twenty minutes.
It's our last night.

14:11.060 --> 14:14.120
- Twenty minutes?
- How much does it cost?

14:14.833 --> 14:18.110
Oh, it's free, it's free.
Are you guys with me?

14:18.609 --> 14:20.944
- Deal.
- All right, fine. One drink.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.113
This is it. We here.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.717
- We're here.
- Yeah. This looks...

14:27.326 --> 14:28.451
Great.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.036
Oh. Okay.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.388
Your vacation starts right now.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.557
Okay, gracias.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.518
You're welcome.
Come on. It's this way.

14:36.627 --> 14:39.563
- You don't look happy.
- Well, where are we?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.410
I don't know, but
it's gonna be cool.

14:43.968 --> 14:46.088
- Careful.
- Right. Okay.

14:46.470 --> 14:47.571
Oh!

14:47.805 --> 14:50.165
- Look at this little guy.
- Hi, little guy.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.160
Whoo.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.204
Ooh!

14:55.938 --> 14:57.081
I'm right here.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.565
Shh.

15:00.693 --> 15:01.943
The music.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.380
- You hear music?
- Yeah.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.756
It's musica.

15:05.823 --> 15:07.466
Yeah, I hear it.

15:07.658 --> 15:08.801
Wait, this is...

15:08.867 --> 15:11.744
No, Zach, let's go back. This
is crazy. Let's turn around.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.204
Don't worry. Don't worry.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.099
We'll be all right. I'm
right here, I'm right here.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.101
All right, I'm right here.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.348
- Don't...
- We'll go slow.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.651
I'm sorry, what?

15:33.642 --> 15:35.643
Oh, wow. Okay.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.457
It's fine, I promise.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.919
- See?
- Go on. Go on.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.137
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.503
It's special!

16:04.715 --> 16:06.942
This is insane!

16:09.553 --> 16:13.196
Authentic Santo Domingo. Come on

16:14.600 --> 16:16.326
Oh, see how great. Here we go.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.619
Cheers!

16:19.063 --> 16:21.623
Yes! Beautiful!

16:21.857 --> 16:23.399
- Here we go.
- Ah!

16:23.400 --> 16:24.840
- I'm gonna hold my nose.
- Ah!

16:25.235 --> 16:27.070
That's not how you take
a shot. You sipped it.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.112
No!

16:28.113 --> 16:29.353
You gotta do another. One more.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.884
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

16:31.950 --> 16:33.076
Oh, thank you!

16:33.077 --> 16:35.012
- They just got married, too.
- No way!

16:35.788 --> 16:38.140
Yes!

16:38.248 --> 16:39.349
I'm done.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.518
Oh, yes!

16:41.919 --> 16:43.020
Oh.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.526
These men are staring at me.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.593
What?

16:50.594 --> 16:53.429
I said, "These men
are staring at me."

16:56.141 --> 16:57.868
I guess you'll do.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.245
I can't dance anymore.

17:01.105 --> 17:02.623
Hi!

17:03.107 --> 17:04.875
Hi!

17:05.943 --> 17:08.127
Hey, babe, let's put it away.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.307
<i>- Yes?
- Yes</i>

18:22.770 --> 18:24.621
Come on, wife.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.123
Time to get up.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.541
- Come on.
- No.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.860
Yes. I'm sorry, but
we gotta get up.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.130
Ugh.

18:33.197 --> 18:34.965
I'm so hung over.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.967
Yeah, no kidding.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.679
Mmm, oh, God, get away with that.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.079
Come on, I'll get you some water.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.620
We gotta get up and
catch this plane.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.058
Okay.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.603
Oh.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.921
Yeah, my head is killing me.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.315
Me, too.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.026
Oh, shit. I'm stuck.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.486
Mmm.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.031
How did we get home last night?

18:59.097 --> 19:00.717
I don't know. The guy in the cab?

19:02.726 --> 19:03.827
Stop. Not right now.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.874
See you later, Santo Domingo.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.711
- Well, we're home.
- Mmm.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.838
Home sweet home.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.740
The honeymoon is over.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.593
Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.178
- Hold this.
- Oh.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.971
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.550
- Okay, here we go.
- All right.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.228
Welcome home, Mrs. McCall.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.440
Ugh.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.608
Oh.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.693
- Suzie left the door open.
- Great.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.320
That's great.

19:38.846 --> 19:40.197
Oh.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.074
Yay, home.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.409
Ooh, presents.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.702
Crate and Barrel, Crate and Barrel.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.950
I'll go get the bags.

19:46.979 --> 19:50.248
All right. We got the panini grill.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.251
And that thing from Allison.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.528
And what is this one?

19:55.529 --> 19:56.990
Oh, I don't know. Open it up.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.966
Mav, do you want to open it?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.385
- All right. OK.
- He doesn't care.

20:02.119 --> 20:06.723
This is the juicer that I wanted!

20:06.790 --> 20:11.603
I'm gonna make so much stuff
with flax and probiotics...

20:12.045 --> 20:14.147
and things with kale.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.984
- Kale?
- Mmm.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.052
Kale... kale.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.407
Oh, Mav!

20:23.849 --> 20:25.492
Oh, my God.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.744
- Look at him.
- Oh!

20:28.061 --> 20:31.164
Hey, did you see the "Sold"
sign on the Anderson house?

20:31.231 --> 20:34.292
For real? Maybe someone will
finally fix that place up.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.961
I hope so. It's terrible.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.255
Your husband, he can't
grill for shit.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.239
Sam, come on. You're gonna miss it.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.093
This will be awesome. Ready?
Just like we practiced.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.637
Are you kidding me? Come on,
Maverick. No, no, no.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.264
You're supposed to catch it.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.932
- Zach.
- Yeah?

20:48.999 --> 20:51.268
Come on, ready? Eye on the prize.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.103
Yes, yes, yes!

20:53.170 --> 20:54.604
- Zach.
- What?

20:55.255 --> 20:58.358
Can you turn that
off for one second?

20:59.384 --> 21:00.509
Whoa.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.612
What is that?

21:05.766 --> 21:07.034
Uh...

21:08.769 --> 21:11.621
It doesn't make any sense.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.899
I've taken the pill religiously.
I've never missed one ever.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.376
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

21:18.779 --> 21:20.464
You're pregnant?

21:22.532 --> 21:24.468
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.763
We're having a baby.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.806
Holy shit!

21:31.083 --> 21:33.810
Oh, my God. That's so amazing.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.972
I feel good about this
office. How about you?

21:38.973 --> 21:42.819
I feel good. Except that says three stages
of pregnancy, and there's four pictures.

21:42.886 --> 21:46.698
Okay, so this isn't a math office.
It's a doctor's office.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.825
I hope that doctors can do math.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.286
Well, the doctor didn't
make that sign, clearly.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.353
Do you think the doctor made
the "Dirty Area" sign?

21:54.439 --> 21:55.832
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.668
Mr. and Mrs. McCall.
Hello, how are you?

21:58.735 --> 22:01.004
- I'm Zach.
- I am Dr. Ludka.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.965
Nice to finally meet. Yes.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.967
- Hello, lucky lady.
- Hi.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.910
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.495
Okay. You ready?

22:09.496 --> 22:10.830
Yeah.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.641
Okay, this is gonna
be quick and painless.

22:12.708 --> 22:13.809
Awesome.

22:14.084 --> 22:15.644
- Sorry.
- "Awesome."

22:15.711 --> 22:18.796
You know you get a copy
of the ultrasound, right?

22:18.797 --> 22:20.524
Oh, yeah, I just, um...

22:20.549 --> 22:22.025
This is his thing.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.568
- It's our thing.
- It's our thing.

22:23.635 --> 22:27.697
We just want to film a bunch of this
so he/she, whoever, can see it later.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.658
- It's for the baby.
- Okay, sure.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.868
- Is it okay?
- Oh, yeah, perfect.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.079
Okay. Make sure you
get my good side.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.414
- Done. Right there.
- Both sides.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.834
This is gonna be a little cold.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.629
Mmm-hmm.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.589
- A little gooey, huh?
- Yeah. Oh!

22:45.157 --> 22:48.718
- That's great.
- Okay.

22:49.995 --> 22:51.721
- Ah, there we go.
- Oh.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.600
Can you see? There's your
uterus, right there.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.062
And there's the heartbeat.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.402
Huh, um...

23:05.469 --> 23:06.635
What?

23:06.636 --> 23:09.114
Oh, don't worry, I'm just
gonna make a few adjustments.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.615
Is it okay?

23:11.850 --> 23:13.285
Uh...

23:14.311 --> 23:17.205
Ah, there we go.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.815
- So, you're about seven weeks along.
- Ooh.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.751
And everything looks really good.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.378
Honeymoon baby.

23:24.321 --> 23:29.092
The pill is about 99 percent effective,
but, occasionally, this happens.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.743
Okay.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.328
- She winked at me.
- I saw that.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.347
Because I got good sperm.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.624
- This is what you started.
- What? It's good, strong sperm.

23:36.625 --> 23:40.061
I'm gonna prescribe vitamin B...

23:40.128 --> 23:42.939
- and iron, since you're a vegetarian.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:42.982 --> 23:44.965
Yeah, I've been trying
to break her of that.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.443
- It's for the baby.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:46.510 --> 23:50.405
But, overall, you're pretty healthy. I'm
expecting a pretty smooth ride, here.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.907
- Awesome.
- Great.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.450
- Okay?
- Thank you.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.202
One more thing.

23:56.561 --> 23:57.686
Ooh.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.372
Congratulations.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.625
The due date is March 30th.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.127
- Hey, he looks like you.
- He doesn't!

24:04.194 --> 24:05.712
A little jelly bean.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.466
- Ooh, Will you hold this?
- Oh, sure.

24:09.533 --> 24:14.471
- It's our first family video.
- Oh, sweet.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.973
That's awesome.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.642
Sorry. Thanks.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.796
All right, I expect you
guys back in five weeks.

24:25.336 --> 24:26.799
I think Maverick drank my wine.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.821
Aw, Mav, he's such a lush.

24:31.888 --> 24:36.826
Hey, have your ankles and
toes started swelling up?

24:36.893 --> 24:40.664
Oh, my God, with the ankles.
Yes, they're swelling up.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.625
I read in the baby book, it says
that those things swell sometimes.

24:43.692 --> 24:47.796
They do. My entire thing
is swelling right now.

24:47.863 --> 24:51.240
It looks good. You could use
a little meat on your bones.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.760
Mmm-mmm. I don't like it.

24:54.035 --> 24:58.014
- Hey, ew. I mean, whoa.
- What? Oh, God.

24:58.081 --> 25:01.333
- You haven't noticed that?
- No, what is that?

25:01.334 --> 25:02.418
- Oh.
- Does it hurt?

25:02.419 --> 25:05.838
No, I think my body is being
taken over by hormones.

25:05.839 --> 25:09.526
Ugh, this is not supposed to be
happening yet. Don't look at that.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.361
All these weird things
are gonna happen to you.

25:11.428 --> 25:16.283
You're making a person
inside of your person.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.994
Seriously, that's amazing.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.870
- Sam.
- Mmm?

25:20.937 --> 25:24.708
You're making a baby.
I can't do that.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.042
Yeah.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.617
Mmm.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.888
Oh, she woke you up?

25:39.748 --> 25:43.226
Yeah. So, your mother snores.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.563
Even though she
categorically denies it.

25:46.630 --> 25:50.734
But we now have hard evidence.
So, if she ever denies it again...

25:52.636 --> 25:54.904
Oh, hey. Sam.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.532
Sam, hey.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.410
Jesus, Sam.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.245
Sam.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.539
Hey.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.419
Go to sleep.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.531
What are you doing?

26:14.532 --> 26:15.759
Hello.

26:15.784 --> 26:20.847
They're getting restless.
So, I'll leave it to Sam.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.932
We're having a baby.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.435
Oh, my God!

26:29.839 --> 26:31.358
What?

26:31.424 --> 26:33.735
We get to be grandparents again.

26:35.762 --> 26:36.905
Stop.

26:36.972 --> 26:38.281
Congratulations.

26:38.348 --> 26:41.951
Flip it. Flip that card that
you just had in your hand.

26:42.477 --> 26:45.688
Thank you. Seven,
king, so I get it.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.959
- Tofu?
- What did you think it was?

26:50.026 --> 26:51.920
I wish you wouldn't have
told me it was tofu.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.465
- I mean, did they do a sonogram?
- Oh, yeah.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.467
Did you get a picture?

26:57.534 --> 27:01.096
She wants a picture to show
everybody immediately.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.472
Oh, ultrasound.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.517
If you go with a C-section, your
body just bounces right back.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.893
- Great.
- What?

27:06.960 --> 27:11.773
Natalie, why don't you try to not
micro-manage their entire thing?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.274
I checked under the fridge.
It's not there.

27:13.341 --> 27:16.260
- You lifted the fridge up?
- I looked under it.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.386
We'll find it.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.864
I couldn't find it. When I
do, I'll email it to you.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.307
I hope you find it.

27:21.308 --> 27:22.617
We Will.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.102
I'm just gonna be on
pins and needles to see it.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.123
Oh, my God, Sam, you're bleeding.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.208
- Oh, God.
- Oh, jeez, here.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.960
Sam, here you go. This is clean.

27:32.027 --> 27:33.378
Tilt your head back.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.341
This is where you'll go to school.

27:38.408 --> 27:41.594
I got beat up here a couple times,
but that's not gonna happen to you.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.454
You're gonna be a much cooler kid.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.016
Ah, this is where me and
your mom got married.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.394
Very pretty church.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.897
This is where we walk the dog.

27:54.049 --> 27:57.569
Here's the Anderson house.
It still looks like shit.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.446
Shit, fuck. Maverick!

28:00.096 --> 28:01.739
Maverick, God damn.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.993
Hey, hey. Maverick!

28:05.060 --> 28:07.787
Come here. Hey, no, no.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.688
No, no, we don't live here.
Come on.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.375
All right, come on.

28:13.318 --> 28:14.401
Come on.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.463
This is your house.

28:16.529 --> 28:19.549
That's your room up
there on the left.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.677
Your granddad says
that it's a money pit...

28:23.203 --> 28:26.514
but it's got good bones. Shit.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.057
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.435
Do you think this
looks too mish-mash?

28:30.543 --> 28:31.895
Um...

28:32.212 --> 28:34.189
Do you want the truth?

28:35.170 --> 28:36.907
I'm giving our baby a
tour of the house.

28:36.908 --> 28:40.111
- Yeah? Hey, that's not the house.
- Sorry.

28:40.178 --> 28:43.865
And the grand finale, your room.

28:43.932 --> 28:46.975
Formerly known as
your mother's office.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.852
But now we are converting.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.331
- Thank you for giving up your office.
- Mmm-hmm. Whoa!

28:51.731 --> 28:53.750
- Jeez.
- Watch it, there.

28:54.275 --> 28:58.463
I study on the couch all the time,
anyway, so it's not a big deal.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.905
It's a pretty good room, though.

28:59.906 --> 29:04.093
She really didn't do anything in
it, so I think it's only fair.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.888
It's gonna be kind of cool, though.
You and I are gonna hang in here.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.097
Hey.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.393
- Do you see this guy across the street?
- Huh?

29:12.919 --> 29:15.396
He's just staring up at the house.

29:16.214 --> 29:19.317
- What the fuck?
- Oh, it's creepy.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.361
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.695
- How was class?
- Ow!

29:22.846 --> 29:26.866
Ugh. It was fine. I just had
to leave because I'm starving.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.452
I think there's some
leftover Pad Thai in there.

29:29.519 --> 29:31.287
I know, I don't want that.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.938
Okay.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.999
Um...

29:35.024 --> 29:37.460
I'm just gonna eat a
bunch of cookies.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.755
How are you feeling?

29:41.531 --> 29:43.258
Fine.

29:43.324 --> 29:44.968
I'm just hungry.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.151
All right. Whoo! Get ready.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.570
- Hey, no!
- Oh!

31:27.637 --> 31:29.322
- What?
- Hello?

31:29.389 --> 31:32.760
I told you that this was off-limits
until I told you that it was on-limits.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.268
But it's just Emily,
I want her to see it.

31:34.269 --> 31:35.411
It looks so good.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.274
I don't care about
Emily, I care about you.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.666
- Okay. Thanks.
- Great.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.584
Are you guys gonna
pick a color or...?

31:41.651 --> 31:44.212
- One of these days.
- This looks really good, though.

31:44.279 --> 31:47.382
- Oh, look! Oh, my God.
- Yep.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.092
- That's really nice.
- You made that?

31:49.158 --> 31:50.534
It's gonna look way better.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.661
You're doing a great job.
I'm very proud of you.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.808
- Well, here's the crib.
- Uh-huh.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.792
- Hey!
- Oh, wow.

31:58.793 --> 32:00.269
That looks really good.

32:00.336 --> 32:03.314
Yeah, we got it at the antique place
and then I brought it home...

32:03.381 --> 32:07.902
and sanded it down and refinished
it and stuff. Made it baby-safe.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.655
- I know you're big on baby safety.
- Yeah, it looks great.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.347
Cute sheets.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.449
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:13.474 --> 32:16.285
- I got you. Okay.
- Ah!

32:16.352 --> 32:18.621
I got you. Sit down.

32:19.814 --> 32:20.957
Are you okay?

32:21.024 --> 32:22.625
It happened this morning, too.

32:23.401 --> 32:24.961
- This bad?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.506
- Hey. Just breathe, okay?
- Mmm.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.633
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:30.700 --> 32:31.825
Lie down, maybe?

32:31.826 --> 32:32.969
Are you sure?

32:33.036 --> 32:35.304
I'll just sit here for a sec.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.349
In...

32:39.375 --> 32:41.477
and out.

32:43.546 --> 32:45.481
In...

32:49.177 --> 32:52.613
Do you see what I'm doing for you?
I'm learning how to breathe.

32:56.684 --> 32:59.495
You might actually have to
know some of this stuff.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.438
I know this stuff.
I know how to breathe.

33:01.439 --> 33:05.376
Okay. I know that you know how to
breathe, but there's other stuff.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.170
Okay.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.504
Stop!

33:09.530 --> 33:13.718
You are strong. You are healthy.

33:14.952 --> 33:19.223
Your body is going through
a beautiful transformation.

33:19.749 --> 33:22.018
That's a load of shit.

33:22.085 --> 33:27.190
I want you all to imagine a
place that's calming, quiet.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.818
Make it a specific memory.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.321
Where are you?

33:33.388 --> 33:35.740
On the beach on our honeymoon.

33:36.933 --> 33:39.368
How old are you?

33:41.771 --> 33:43.873
Are you alone?

33:46.150 --> 33:49.045
Breathe into this memory
that brings you joy.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.883
Okay, everyone, please breathe.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.886
If you're gonna sit up,
sit up slowly.

33:57.662 --> 34:00.848
Very slowly. Keep
breathing, everyone.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.725
Please remain calm.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.352
Sam. Are you okay?

34:04.669 --> 34:07.104
- So, this is happening.
- Yep.

34:07.255 --> 34:09.065
We are buying baby stuff.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.609
Baby stuff!

34:13.219 --> 34:15.178
- Let's go crazy.
- Yeah, let's go nuts.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.739
Ooh! Uh...

34:17.139 --> 34:20.784
Do you want to practice a little diapering?
Get a little wrap around this guy?

34:20.851 --> 34:23.496
- I'm good.
- You don't want to do that?

34:23.563 --> 34:25.790
He's not even in a box.
He's clearly dirty.

34:25.857 --> 34:28.835
Yeah, where'd this baby come from?
I don't know you, baby.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.652
You bent him over, looked at his
ass to see where it came from.

34:31.654 --> 34:34.257
I just wanted to know if he
had a name or something.

34:35.283 --> 34:36.366
Ah...

34:36.367 --> 34:37.635
It's a milk pump!

34:37.702 --> 34:39.762
Not at all.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.097
- No?
- No.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.630
- We need one though, right?
- Yeah, we do actually need one.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.185
I never want to see you
do that ever again.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.108
Probably not.

34:52.675 --> 34:55.652
No, I think we got everything. This
is all a baby needs, right here.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.262
Ow!

34:57.263 --> 34:58.948
Are you all right?

34:59.292 --> 35:01.516
I'm gonna go get the car,
all right? Just hold on.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.618
No, I'm fine.

35:02.685 --> 35:05.621
No, seriously, Sam.
Please, just wait there.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.707
I'll be right there.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

35:08.399 --> 35:10.293
Oh, shit! Sam!

35:10.359 --> 35:11.502
Motherfucker!

35:11.778 --> 35:14.672
What are you doing?
Are you fucking crazy?

35:14.739 --> 35:16.419
- Get away from my car!
- Stop, stop!

35:21.037 --> 35:23.139
It's okay. It's okay.

35:24.907 --> 35:27.250
We're gonna get some help.
We're gonna get some help.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.312
It's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.147
What happened? What happened?

35:31.214 --> 35:34.317
Breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe, just breathe.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.652
What is wrong with me?

35:36.719 --> 35:38.779
Something is wrong!

35:41.224 --> 35:42.325
Hey.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.995
You look really pretty
when you're pensive.

35:46.229 --> 35:48.080
I'm serious.

35:48.481 --> 35:49.582
Hey...

35:51.442 --> 35:54.069
Look what I found behind your ear.

35:54.070 --> 35:55.546
Nothing.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.383
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.344
Hi, Samantha. I'm Dr. Dylan.

36:01.410 --> 36:03.346
Where's Dr. Ludka?

36:03.412 --> 36:07.099
Dr. Ludka had to take a leave
of absence. I'm covering for her.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.851
Well...

36:08.918 --> 36:12.063
Excuse me. Is she gonna
be back anytime soon?

36:12.129 --> 36:15.733
She filled me in, and
I've studied your file.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.011
Well, will she be back
by the time we deliver?

36:20.012 --> 36:21.864
Yeah, can we talk to her?

36:21.931 --> 36:26.035
I don't think she's gonna be able to come
back. Let's talk about your symptoms.

36:26.477 --> 36:27.578
Oh.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.373
Okay.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.500
Huh.

36:33.693 --> 36:35.920
The baby looks healthy.

36:36.279 --> 36:38.780
But it's turned around.

36:38.781 --> 36:42.468
We're not gonna be able to find
out if it's a boy or girl today.

36:42.535 --> 36:44.575
- It's gotten so much bigger.
- Mmm.

36:47.123 --> 36:48.724
Sam, are you okay?

37:02.889 --> 37:04.949
She just needs a minute.

37:05.016 --> 37:07.702
Sorry, the nausea hasn't
really gotten better.

37:07.768 --> 37:10.246
It actually seems like
it's gotten kind of worse.

37:10.313 --> 37:13.874
Well, it's not entirely unusual.

37:14.692 --> 37:16.002
Um...

37:16.444 --> 37:19.797
She's been getting nosebleeds,
too. Are those...?

37:19.864 --> 37:22.008
Yeah, it can be.

37:23.993 --> 37:25.845
She just doesn't seem
like herself lately.

37:25.912 --> 37:29.140
Is there a history of mental
illness in her family?

37:29.498 --> 37:31.684
Uh, I don't know.

37:32.084 --> 37:37.231
She took some meds during
college for anxiety.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.942
I don't really know what they were.

37:40.676 --> 37:41.777
Um...

37:42.345 --> 37:45.281
We don't really know
anything about her family.

37:45.348 --> 37:49.326
Her parents were killed in a car crash
and they had to cut Sam out of her womb.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.811
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.248
Hey.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.929
You look beautiful.

37:56.984 --> 37:58.961
I'm really sorry.

37:59.028 --> 38:01.068
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

38:01.739 --> 38:07.386
I'm gonna do an amnio now,
just to rule out any issues.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.723
Especially since you don't know
what may run in your family.

38:10.790 --> 38:11.891
Okay.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.269
- Are you all right?
- Mmm.

38:16.045 --> 38:18.105
Okay. Good.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.940
I'm good, too.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.817
Good. I was worried about you.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.984
I know. I could tell,
because you asked.

38:24.011 --> 38:25.613
Uh, is this gonna hurt?

38:25.680 --> 38:28.991
Oh, it's just a little pressure.
It'll be over before you know it.

38:30.184 --> 38:34.371
I need you to stay very still.
Nurse, watch the monitor, please.

38:34.647 --> 38:36.999
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you ready?

38:37.066 --> 38:39.835
Just relax. Take a deep breath.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.464
Mmm.

38:43.864 --> 38:44.948
Mmm-mmm.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.425
Are you okay?

38:47.326 --> 38:48.844
- No.
- It's okay.

38:48.911 --> 38:51.722
Something's wrong. Can you
get it out? Can you get it out?

38:51.789 --> 38:52.890
- Keep her still.
- Is everything okay?

38:52.957 --> 38:55.392
- No, no. Mmm-mmm.
- Just try to stay still.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.539
- Samantha, we're almost there.
- Can you get it out?

38:57.545 --> 39:00.064
Can you get it out?
Please, get it out!

39:00.131 --> 39:01.941
You're gonna hurt
yourself. Sam, please.

39:02.091 --> 39:03.442
Get it out!

39:03.509 --> 39:05.569
Can you get it out
of her? Thank you.

39:05.636 --> 39:08.697
It's out. It's done, it's done.

39:08.764 --> 39:11.075
Hey, hey. It's done.

39:12.143 --> 39:13.994
It's okay. All right?

39:15.062 --> 39:16.539
It's okay.

39:16.647 --> 39:20.501
I can't do this. I can't do this.

39:21.444 --> 39:22.545
It's all right.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.714
I'm really worried about her.
I don't know what to do.

39:25.781 --> 39:27.925
Do you think she'd ever
actually hurt herself?

39:27.992 --> 39:29.343
What?

39:29.827 --> 39:32.972
No. I don't know, I don't think so.

39:33.789 --> 39:36.767
Just to be safe, we'll be
keeping a close eye on her.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.519
Okay.

40:38.062 --> 40:39.663
I'm gonna fix this door someday.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.540
Yeah, that'll be great.

40:41.607 --> 40:44.043
- Watch your step.
- Okay, thank you.

40:44.110 --> 40:48.172
I'm so glad my sister
bought me that flashlight.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.931
How are you doing?

40:56.997 --> 41:00.875
I feel like a hot air balloon.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.479
- You're going upstairs?
- Mmm-hmm.

41:03.546 --> 41:05.314
- I'm gonna go take a bath.
- Okay.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.690
I'm just gonna check
the score on the game.

41:06.757 --> 41:08.567
All right.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.574
This thing takes
forever to turn on.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.629
We need to get a fucking maid.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.594
Oh, look.

42:18.329 --> 42:19.930
That's beautiful.

42:20.456 --> 42:22.182
Wow. Nice.

42:26.795 --> 42:30.566
Do you want to take off while
we wait for the results?

42:32.468 --> 42:36.697
Go to a spa, or...
Let's just get out of town.

42:40.893 --> 42:43.579
- It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

42:43.646 --> 42:48.625
I'm just thinking, though, you've
already taken so much time off of work.

42:48.692 --> 42:53.797
And I've got finals and we should probably
be close to the doctor right now.

42:56.033 --> 42:59.053
All right. It's just a thought.

42:59.119 --> 43:01.138
It's a good thought.

43:03.707 --> 43:05.851
I'm gonna be all right.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.395
I know.

43:19.807 --> 43:21.533
One second. Okay.

43:22.726 --> 43:24.661
Surprise!

43:30.939 --> 43:33.629
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Wow, thank you.

43:33.696 --> 43:34.922
Great, son. How are you?

43:34.989 --> 43:37.841
I'm very well, thank you. Hi, Ma.

43:38.242 --> 43:41.303
- Happy birthday, Aunt Sam.
- Oh, my gosh.

43:41.954 --> 43:44.139
Happy birthday!

43:44.373 --> 43:46.809
No, I'm fine, I just gotta rest.

43:46.875 --> 43:47.976
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

43:48.043 --> 43:49.127
Why are you guys
hiding in the corner?

43:49.128 --> 43:50.229
Hey.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.088
Looking good!

43:52.089 --> 43:53.565
- Thank you.
- Um...

43:53.666 --> 43:56.009
She's just gonna go upstairs
for a little bit, take a rest.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.694
I gotta lie down. I'll be back.

43:57.730 --> 43:59.554
I'll come up in a little
bit and check on you.

43:59.555 --> 44:01.281
I just need a few minutes.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.702
- I'll clean all this up.
- No, I got it, I got it.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.913
I'm gonna help you, too.
It's fine, I got it.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.791
You guys got everyone here,
I'll clean it all up.

44:10.858 --> 44:12.084
It's no problem. That's
what friends are for.

44:12.151 --> 44:14.253
- Can I have some cake?
- Yeah, here you go.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.754
- Is this too big a bite?
- No.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.424
Oh, that's cute.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.551
- We're the sweetest.
- We're so cute.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.636
How's Sam?

44:22.703 --> 44:26.849
I don't know, I haven't been
up there since she went up.

44:26.915 --> 44:32.054
Honestly, in general,
she has not been herself.

44:32.463 --> 44:36.567
The doctor says that everything is
fine, and we've done all these tests.

44:37.265 --> 44:39.969
But she's just convinced that there's
something wrong with the baby.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.780
- She's adamant about it.
- Wow.

44:44.683 --> 44:46.577
Braedon.

44:46.643 --> 44:49.621
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

44:52.483 --> 44:54.501
Braedon?

44:59.573 --> 45:02.259
Come on, I know you're in here.

45:07.081 --> 45:09.391
Braedon.

45:21.136 --> 45:22.905
Braedon?

45:29.645 --> 45:33.165
Braedon, come out.
It's not funny anymore.

45:49.164 --> 45:50.265
Braedon.

45:54.169 --> 45:55.354
Get out!

46:17.192 --> 46:19.211
I think I just saw you move.

46:19.570 --> 46:23.048
All right, come on. Do it again.

46:23.699 --> 46:26.677
Lift this back so we can see you.

46:26.743 --> 46:29.388
All right, buddy, let's go.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.266
Ah.

46:33.375 --> 46:36.478
You're sleeping like
your lazy mother.

46:38.589 --> 46:40.691
Lazy bones.

46:42.134 --> 46:44.152
It's all right.

46:46.388 --> 46:47.656
Shh.

46:54.938 --> 46:57.332
Mav, hey. Hey.

47:19.254 --> 47:22.399
You know, we talked about
the summer courses.

47:22.466 --> 47:25.986
So, I figured I'd just get a
couple of classes going...

47:26.053 --> 47:29.323
and then go back to the
full load in the fall.

47:29.389 --> 47:31.867
You don't want to just
wait until the fall?

47:33.060 --> 47:36.872
No, I don't want to just
wait until the fall.

47:42.736 --> 47:43.819
Okay, I was just
thinking because...

47:43.820 --> 47:46.882
I know, it's just that
this has come up and I...

47:46.949 --> 47:49.283
No, I know. But the baby
is coming in March.

47:49.284 --> 47:53.555
I know it's not gonna be easy. But I don't
want to put everything on hold just to...

47:53.622 --> 47:56.725
We're not putting everything
on hold indefinitely.

47:56.792 --> 47:59.895
- I gotta keep working.
- But if I stop doing it now...

47:59.962 --> 48:03.273
then I feel like I'm not gonna
be able to start back up again.

48:03.340 --> 48:04.882
I'm gonna be stuck in this house

48:04.883 --> 48:06.693
and I'm gonna become
some housewife.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.403
Then I'm gonna turn
into your sister.

48:08.470 --> 48:10.471
I'm gonna be Natalie, and
I don't want to be her.

48:10.472 --> 48:12.366
Sam, you're not gonna be
Natalie. It's you and me.

48:12.432 --> 48:13.950
That's what it's turning
into. I know that...

48:14.017 --> 48:17.579
but this isn't what I
wanted to begin with, okay?

48:17.646 --> 48:20.582
I didn't want to get
pregnant and now I am.

48:20.649 --> 48:22.959
And I just want life
to go back to normal.

48:23.026 --> 48:27.422
I don't want to talk about it anymore and
my fucking hair is falling out, okay?

48:27.489 --> 48:28.924
Sam! Whoa.

48:32.828 --> 48:34.763
- Hey.
- Hi. Are you excited?

48:34.830 --> 48:36.765
- Yeah!
- Yeah, why?

48:37.666 --> 48:40.936
- Because today's my First Communion.
- Oh, shoot, my bad.

48:46.717 --> 48:47.943
Hi.

48:48.010 --> 48:51.238
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
How are you feeling?

48:51.305 --> 48:53.073
Well, well, well.

48:53.140 --> 48:54.950
Are you ready for your
big day, young lady?

48:55.017 --> 48:57.643
- You've got the whole family here.
- Yeah.

48:59.021 --> 49:00.455
- Hello, Sam.
- Hi.

49:00.522 --> 49:02.690
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing well, how are you?

49:02.691 --> 49:05.168
I'm good, really.

49:05.527 --> 49:07.462
So, when is the little one due?

49:07.738 --> 49:09.631
- One month.
- One more month.

49:09.698 --> 49:11.738
- One month. That's good.
- Are you all right?

49:11.742 --> 49:12.992
Do you want a bottle of water?

49:12.993 --> 49:16.138
No, I'll be fine. One month.
That's the home stretch, right?

49:16.204 --> 49:17.431
Yeah.

49:17.497 --> 49:20.308
I've just got something in
my throat. I'm so sorry.

49:20.375 --> 49:22.644
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

49:49.363 --> 49:52.507
I think that's the nicest
procession I've ever seen.

49:53.450 --> 49:57.637
Boys and girls,
we are so proud of you.

49:57.704 --> 49:59.389
And we are so happy...

49:59.456 --> 50:03.226
to have you here this morning on this
big important day in your lives.

50:03.293 --> 50:08.190
Newest members of our church to gather
round for the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

50:09.716 --> 50:14.521
We are here to celebrate with you
today your first Holy Communion.

50:15.430 --> 50:17.324
Also, the first time...

50:17.391 --> 50:21.912
you receive our Lord Jesus
Christ into your souls.

50:22.479 --> 50:23.580
Uh...

50:30.779 --> 50:32.380
Excuse me.

50:33.949 --> 50:36.218
Uh, this sacrament...

50:44.793 --> 50:47.628
It is a sacrament...

50:58.765 --> 51:01.368
Father Thomas, are you okay?

51:12.779 --> 51:14.256
Where was I?

51:23.248 --> 51:24.432
He needs help!

51:24.499 --> 51:27.018
It's okay, Father. Go call 911.

51:27.085 --> 51:28.520
Thomas, Thomas.

51:29.838 --> 51:31.773
Hey, whoa, Sam.

51:32.340 --> 51:35.110
Hey, hey! Stop, Sam.

51:35.177 --> 51:37.279
Look, it's me.

51:37.345 --> 51:39.865
Hold on. Stop. Stop!

51:39.931 --> 51:41.908
All right. Hey! It's okay.

51:45.353 --> 51:49.374
I don't remember what
happened back there.

51:50.776 --> 51:53.044
With Father Thomas.

51:56.531 --> 51:58.300
Did I...

52:00.494 --> 52:02.637
Did I do that to him?

52:02.704 --> 52:05.140
What? No.

52:06.333 --> 52:07.851
Hey.

52:08.835 --> 52:11.438
What the fuck is wrong with me?

52:11.755 --> 52:14.649
<i>Hey, hey! Stop, Sam.</i>

52:15.091 --> 52:16.818
<i>Look, it's me. It's Zach.</i>

52:16.885 --> 52:19.362
<i>Hold on. Stop. Stop!</i>

52:19.429 --> 52:21.489
<i>All right? Hey! It's okay.</i>

52:22.098 --> 52:25.136
<i>- Zach...
- Let's just go. Let's just go home.</i>

52:25.560 --> 52:28.604
<i>Oh, I am so sorry. Where was I?</i>

52:34.236 --> 52:36.821
<i>Jesus Christ into your soul.</i>

53:14.317 --> 53:16.586
<i>Born from death.</i>

53:17.612 --> 53:19.214
Twenty? Oh, it's free.

53:23.689 --> 53:25.953
<i>- Look at this little guy.
- Hey, little guy.</i>

53:25.954 --> 53:27.931
<i>Yeah, I hear it.</i>

53:28.290 --> 53:29.724
<i>No, Zach, come on.</i>

53:32.377 --> 53:34.145
<i>These men are staring at me.</i>

53:34.421 --> 53:35.462
<i>What?</i>

53:35.463 --> 53:38.316
<i>I said, "These men
are staring at me."</i>

53:39.050 --> 53:42.404
<i>Hey, babe, let's put it away.</i>

53:58.486 --> 53:59.667
- Come on.
- No.

53:59.696 --> 54:02.966
<i>Yes. I'm sorry, but
we gotta get up.</i>

54:04.200 --> 54:05.659
<i>Ugh.</i>

54:05.660 --> 54:07.178
<i>I'm so hung over.</i>

54:07.329 --> 54:09.305
<i>Yeah, no kidding.</i>

54:11.374 --> 54:13.601
Hey, Mason, it's Zach. Um...

54:15.754 --> 54:19.357
Can you come over for a little bit?
I need to talk to you about something.

54:20.008 --> 54:23.403
Thanks. And I'll meet you outside,
in front of the house, okay?

54:23.470 --> 54:25.488
I don't want to bother Sam.

54:26.306 --> 54:28.140
Okay.

54:28.141 --> 54:29.909
<i>Mmm...</i>

54:30.101 --> 54:32.704
<i>How did we get home last night?</i>

54:32.771 --> 54:34.789
<i>I don't know. The guy in the cab?</i>

54:35.732 --> 54:38.001
What the fuck?

54:55.919 --> 54:58.354
He was like our cab driver,
on our honeymoon.

54:58.421 --> 55:01.441
So I came home, looked at all the tapes,
and there's all this mystery fucking...

55:01.508 --> 55:02.591
Look at this.

55:02.592 --> 55:06.362
You sure, man? Maybe it's some weird shit
they do down there to scare tourists.

55:06.429 --> 55:08.156
Whoa, what the fuck?

55:08.515 --> 55:09.991
What the fuck?

55:11.142 --> 55:12.535
It's gone.

55:13.895 --> 55:15.497
What are you talking about?

55:15.939 --> 55:19.667
I was literally just looking at
this shit right before you...

55:19.734 --> 55:23.630
I was looking at this right before
you came in, and now it's gone.

55:23.697 --> 55:27.634
It's empty. It's gone. The
fucking tape is gone now.

55:28.535 --> 55:29.147
Fuck!

55:29.173 --> 55:32.931
- Why don't you just take a breath, man?
- No, I don't need to take a...

55:32.998 --> 55:35.350
Wait, hold on. What the fuck?

55:38.003 --> 55:40.355
We've been monitoring him 24/7.

55:44.634 --> 55:47.070
Uh, do you think I can
talk to him privately?

55:47.971 --> 55:51.074
If he needs anything,
we'll be right outside.

55:54.853 --> 55:58.123
Father Thomas, how are you?

56:00.066 --> 56:02.085
I had a small stroke.

56:02.152 --> 56:03.795
Yeah, we heard.

56:03.945 --> 56:06.089
Are you gonna be all right?

56:08.783 --> 56:10.635
How is Sam?

56:10.952 --> 56:14.639
Um, she's okay. That's
actually why I wanted to...

56:14.706 --> 56:18.059
- I'm glad that she's okay.
- Talk to you. Um...

56:22.088 --> 56:24.607
I saw these weird symbols
on our honeymoon.

56:24.674 --> 56:29.070
And, um, I just don't know
really what they are.

56:29.137 --> 56:31.531
And I thought you might...

56:31.598 --> 56:35.034
because everything I've seen says
they're, uh, religious symbols.

56:35.101 --> 56:38.496
So, uh, there's these ones...

56:38.563 --> 56:42.917
and then there's that.

56:44.402 --> 56:46.671
There's a bunch more.

56:46.738 --> 56:49.007
These are the only ones I've
actually seen in person.

56:49.074 --> 56:52.218
The other ones were all just linked
to it when I started looking.

56:52.285 --> 56:56.222
- John, first John.
- What?

56:57.207 --> 57:00.143
First John, 2:18.

57:00.210 --> 57:05.356
"And children,
this is the last hour."

57:05.423 --> 57:09.319
"You have been told
the antichrist is coming..."

57:09.385 --> 57:13.615
"and so, that there are
many that are coming."

57:14.766 --> 57:18.161
"That is how we know
it is the last hour."

57:18.228 --> 57:20.121
What are you talking about?

57:20.188 --> 57:23.208
These are from early, early religion.
These are...

57:23.983 --> 57:26.920
early religion, there
is a sect, dissident.

57:26.986 --> 57:30.548
They tried to bring the church
down in its early days.

57:30.615 --> 57:34.344
They did rites, and they
used those symbols.

57:35.411 --> 57:38.806
They painted them on the point
of entry and on the nest.

57:38.873 --> 57:41.976
The point of conception
and the point of birth.

57:42.293 --> 57:44.586
- What?
- So that he could get in.

57:44.587 --> 57:46.814
There was ash all around.
There was ash everywhere.

57:47.048 --> 57:49.400
The antichrist is coming.

57:49.467 --> 57:52.528
"So will there be
many antichrists..."

57:52.595 --> 57:56.991
"and that is how we know
it is the last hour."

57:57.058 --> 57:58.368
"They will be coming."

57:58.434 --> 57:59.744
I didn't mean to upset you.

57:59.811 --> 58:01.913
- It's the last hour.
- I'm really sorry.

58:01.980 --> 58:05.708
I don't think you can be here with
that anymore. You have to go now.

58:05.775 --> 58:07.710
- I need you to go now, Zach.
- Yeah.

58:07.777 --> 58:10.171
I'm very, very tired
and I need you to go.

58:10.238 --> 58:12.006
- Put that away.
- It's gone.

58:12.073 --> 58:13.591
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

58:13.658 --> 58:16.344
You've upset me. Just go.

58:16.411 --> 58:17.679
- Go.
- I hope you feel better.

58:17.745 --> 58:19.264
Now! Go!

58:19.747 --> 58:21.527
Okay, all right.

58:22.584 --> 58:24.310
Nurse? Nurse, can you...

58:24.669 --> 58:28.064
Um this one is from you.
This is from Emily.

58:30.925 --> 58:34.112
There's more to come.
That's just a taste.

58:34.971 --> 58:36.281
Whose is this one?

58:36.347 --> 58:38.783
I don't know. It
doesn't have a name.

58:38.850 --> 58:41.369
Does this belong to anybody?

58:41.436 --> 58:42.745
Well, anonymous.

58:42.812 --> 58:44.622
- It's nameless.
- Anon.

58:44.689 --> 58:46.874
You're just getting
gifts from everywhere.

58:48.151 --> 58:50.920
Sorry, whoever this is from.

58:50.987 --> 58:52.297
Brooke!

58:52.614 --> 58:54.757
What a sweetheart, Brooke!

58:54.824 --> 58:57.719
I didn't read the note, so,
I don't know what's happening.

58:57.785 --> 58:59.554
That's nice of you.

59:00.163 --> 59:01.723
Sam, are you okay?

59:11.799 --> 59:14.402
How was the shower?

59:18.223 --> 59:19.681
Fine.

59:22.310 --> 59:24.412
Did you hear that?

59:48.169 --> 59:49.604
Fuck.

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:05.571
Every window in the house,
but a lot of them in these.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:10.041
This is really mostly where I see
it, so I don't know what to do.

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:13.461
You know, I have to admit,
it is, uh, kind of weird.

01:00:15.183 --> 01:00:17.614
Someone was in here, all right?
Someone broke into our house.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.967
- Wait, hold on a second.
- But, look at the porch.

01:00:42.432 --> 01:00:45.493
I can file a report, and call us
if there's any other problems.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.330
That's all I can do for now.
You have a nice night.

01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:39.547
Okay, here we go.

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.365
- Here he goes.
- You're gonna break your neck.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:42.949
Uh, uh, uh!

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:47.096
- Oh, he got it! No way!
- Wow, I'm so impressed.

01:01:47.163 --> 01:01:49.390
- What's up?
- Take this. I gotta take a piss.

01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:50.850
Oh, fuck.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:52.501
I'm out.

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:54.395
Do you want to come?
Will you hold it for me?

01:01:54.462 --> 01:01:57.190
No, she doesn't want to.

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:01.444
Since Jay's gone, do you want to...

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:04.614
Hey, guys! You gotta come see this!

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:07.241
- What is he doing?
- Fucker.

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:09.285
You're fucking me up.

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.412
Look what I caught.

01:02:11.479 --> 01:02:14.373
- What is that?
- Oh, fuck.

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:17.126
- Dinner is served, y'all.
- Jay, stop.

01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:19.253
- That is so gross.
- Oh, what in the fuck?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.256
Please, don't touch it.
Oh, it fucking stinks!

01:02:22.323 --> 01:02:24.759
- Hey, take a photo.
- I'm taking a video, jackass.

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.706
- It smells like shit.
- Touch it, see if it's still warm.

01:02:28.538 --> 01:02:31.456
- You guys, there is something over there.
- You're so fucked up.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.976
Look! Do y'all see that?

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:35.203
- Shut up.
- What?

01:02:43.636 --> 01:02:44.737
Wait.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.783
Yo.

01:02:50.059 --> 01:02:51.244
Hey.

01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:54.830
- What is she doing?
- Ash, stay back.

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:58.834
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:03:00.528 --> 01:03:02.630
What the fuck is she doing?

01:03:08.578 --> 01:03:10.471
Oh, my God.

01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:12.139
Oh, shit!

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:13.623
Ma'am, are you okay...

01:03:14.876 --> 01:03:16.686
What the fuck!

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:17.853
Run!

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:24.986
Come on, man. Get up!

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:28.281
What the fuck! Oh, shit!

01:03:41.736 --> 01:03:43.879
No! No!

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.400
Oh, fuck.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.785
Hey, are you all right?

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:18.831
Yeah, I'm good. Actually,
I feel a little bit better.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.708
Good. Um...

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:24.462
Do you need anything?

01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:26.047
No, I'm good. Thanks.

01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:27.715
Okay.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.237
Sam?

01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:54.492
Sam?

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:03.042
Hey.

01:05:07.989 --> 01:05:09.757
Sam.

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:26.816
What are you doing?

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.905
Sam?

01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:36.450
Hey.

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.745
What's going on?

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:44.250
Are you okay?

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.613
Sam, what the fuck is going on?

01:05:49.614 --> 01:05:51.323
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:05:51.324 --> 01:05:53.509
Don't touch us!

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:57.430
Sam, it's just me. All right?

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.098
It's just me.

01:05:59.165 --> 01:06:01.517
Stop, stop, stop! Sam!

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:05.146
It's okay, I think you're
dreaming. Hey, stop.

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:07.648
It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:09.525
It's me. No, it's me.

01:06:11.302 --> 01:06:13.571
I got you. I got you.

01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:15.489
It's me.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:17.307
It's all right, I'm right here.

01:06:17.308 --> 01:06:21.162
See, see? Look, it's just me. Okay?

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.039
Are you okay?

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.066
It's okay.

01:06:26.067 --> 01:06:28.502
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.839
You just had a dream.

01:06:33.908 --> 01:06:35.009
It's okay.

01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:40.347
It's okay.

01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:42.540
<i>The McCalls. Leave us a message,</i>

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.894
<i>and we'll call you back
as soon as we can.</i>

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:48.355
Hey, Dad, um, it's Zach. Uh...

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:53.569
Look, I think Sam and I need to come
over and stay with you and Mom.

01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:57.364
Sam is really freaking out and
it's gotten me really scared.

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:01.660
It's just not normal, okay? And I
know this sounds really crazy...

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:05.414
but I swear, there have
been people watching us.

01:07:05.481 --> 01:07:07.021
We just don't want
to be alone, okay?

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.919
I think we'd just feel a lot better
if we were with you and Mom.

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.838
So, uh, call me back.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:38.656
Fuck.

01:07:44.729 --> 01:07:45.996
Hey!

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.873
Hey!

01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:06.100
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:09.854
Thanks for coming over. Sam
is upstairs, she's sleeping.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.397
Is she feeling okay?

01:08:11.464 --> 01:08:14.275
Yeah, she's fine. I just need
to take off for a minute.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.652
I didn't want her to wake
up and have no one be here.

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.345
- Okay. Where are you going?
- Just don't answer the door.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.407
Okay, bye.

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:25.618
Weirdo.

01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:45.764
Hmm.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:52.854
Sam?

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.569
Sam?

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:08.203
Hey, Sam?

01:09:17.488 --> 01:09:18.964
Hey.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.680
Sam?

01:09:32.837 --> 01:09:34.854
Samantha?

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.298
Sam?

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.404
Samantha?

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:01.840
Sam, Jesus! What are you doing?

01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:06.762
Sam, hey, hey! Give this to me.
Stop, stop, stop. Sam, stop.

01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:07.930
Give this to me.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.391
Sam!

01:10:10.457 --> 01:10:12.101
Sam, stop!

01:12:27.136 --> 01:12:28.737
Fuck.

01:12:30.848 --> 01:12:31.949
Shit.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:11.965
Fuck.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.018
Fuck!

01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:33.362
Oh, shit!

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:46.208
<i>911, what's your emergency?
I need some help.</i>

01:14:46.275 --> 01:14:48.502
Something is happening to my wife.
Please, send someone over.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:52.029
<i>- What's the address?</i>
- 901 Harrison Street. Please.

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:53.530
<i>Sir, I'm sorry, I can't...</i>

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:58.345
Shit.

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.389
What the fuck?

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:10.941
What do you want?

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:17.197
Leave us the fuck alone!

01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:18.699
Sam?

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.204
Ah!

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.164
Fuck.

01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:49.813
Shit. Fuck.

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:01.158
Sam!

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.961
What the fuck?

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.756
Sam?

01:16:28.252 --> 01:16:30.103
Sam?

01:16:32.047 --> 01:16:33.774
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:34.675 --> 01:16:35.984
What the fuck?

01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:08.975
Sam!

01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:14.523
Shit! Fuck!

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:16.316
Sam!

01:17:21.555 --> 01:17:23.323
Sam!

01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:28.328
Sam?

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:30.896
Sam, what are you doing?

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:37.671
What are you doing?

01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:42.509
Stop, Sam. This isn't you.

01:17:42.576 --> 01:17:45.958
Please. Please, just come with me.
Please, let's go. We gotta get...

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:58.859
Oh, God.

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:05.574
Suzie?

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.701
Suzie? Suzie?

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:10.871
Fuck. No, no.

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:12.706
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:18:13.148 --> 01:18:14.749
Fuck.

01:18:18.362 --> 01:18:19.463
Fuck.

01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:26.386
Fuck.

01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:36.730
Sam.

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:40.233
Please. It's okay.

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:43.987
Come on, please. It's me.

01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:46.406
Come on. Just come with me, please.

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:49.242
I'm sorry.

01:18:49.309 --> 01:18:51.244
It's me, come on.

01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:53.246
No!

01:18:56.858 --> 01:18:58.418
No! Stop!

01:19:00.487 --> 01:19:02.589
Please. Please.

01:19:03.031 --> 01:19:04.841
Sam. Sam!

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:07.093
Sam!

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.970
What are you doing?

01:19:09.037 --> 01:19:10.847
Please, just let me down.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:13.308
Sam! Fuck!

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.644
No! No, Sam!

01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:16.853
Sam, no!

01:19:26.847 --> 01:19:29.282
Stop! Please stop, Sam!

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:49.928
- Zach?
- Sam.

01:19:50.537 --> 01:19:52.305
- Zach.
- I'm here.

01:19:54.666 --> 01:19:58.311
What happened? What happened?

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:01.147
It's okay, it's okay.

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:05.610
- Is the baby okay?
- Yeah. I love you.

01:20:06.344 --> 01:20:08.196
Is the baby okay?

01:20:08.263 --> 01:20:11.116
Yes, it's okay.
Don't worry, it's okay.

01:20:13.018 --> 01:20:14.202
I'm sorry.

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:17.122
No. I love you. I love you.

01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:20.041
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:20:24.112 --> 01:20:27.215
No, no, Sam.

01:20:27.282 --> 01:20:28.383
Sam.

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:36.182
Sam, no.

01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:37.851
Fuck.

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:43.523
Please...

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:58.830
No. No, no!

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.916
Stop. Just stop, please.

01:21:04.319 --> 01:21:06.171
Just leave us alone, please.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.175
No, leave her alone.

01:21:10.242 --> 01:21:11.551
Leave her alone!

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:25.690
No.

01:21:28.635 --> 01:21:30.236
Don't, don't, don't...

01:21:33.974 --> 01:21:35.367
No, no. No!

01:21:52.492 --> 01:21:55.679
So, what did you do with the baby?

01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.266
They took it.

01:22:01.668 --> 01:22:06.473
And this is the same "they" who
killed your wife and your sister?

01:22:12.512 --> 01:22:14.080
You know, we checked.

01:22:15.307 --> 01:22:18.818
The Anderson house.

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:30.422
It's been abandoned for years.
Completely empty.

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:38.805
And there's no Dr. Dylan at Willow Oak
or any other hospital in the area.

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:45.603
Why don't you tell us...

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.981
what really happened?

01:22:52.802 --> 01:22:54.612
Mr. McCall?

01:23:03.521 --> 01:23:05.081
Look at it. Oh, my God!

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.291
I got it, sweetie.

01:23:06.358 --> 01:23:09.127
That's so amazing. It's
like a dream come true.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.797
Okay, last day of the honeymoon!

01:23:15.075 --> 01:23:17.010
<i>Au revoir, Paris.</i>

01:23:17.327 --> 01:23:19.179
All right, let's do one together.

01:23:19.245 --> 01:23:20.847
Can we come back next year, baby?

01:23:59.994 --> 01:24:02.121
<i>Oogum, Oogum, Boogum,
Boogum, Boogum</i>

01:24:02.122 --> 01:24:04.933
<i>Now, baby you're casting
your spell on me</i>

01:24:07.377 --> 01:24:11.231
<i>You got me doing
funny things like a clown</i>

01:24:11.548 --> 01:24:13.900
<i>Just look at me</i>

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:18.137
<i>When you wear
your bell-bottom pants</i>

01:24:18.138 --> 01:24:20.406
<i>I just stand there in a trance</i>

01:24:20.807 --> 01:24:24.518
<i>I can't move
You're in the groove</i>

01:24:24.519 --> 01:24:26.687

01:24:26.688 --> 01:24:29.999
<i>That I am crazy 'bout you</i>

01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:35.129
<i>Now go on with your bad self</i>

01:24:44.414 --> 01:24:47.517
<i>Now mercy, mercy on me</i>

01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:49.835
<i>All right</i>

01:24:49.836 --> 01:24:52.171
<i>When you wear those big earrings</i>

01:24:52.172 --> 01:24:54.357
<i>Long hair and things</i>

01:24:54.841 --> 01:24:58.319
<i>You got style, girl
That sure is wild</i>

01:24:58.428 --> 01:25:00.679
<i>And you wear
that cute trench coat</i>

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.265
<i>And you're standin' and posin'</i>

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:06.852
<i>You got soul
You got too much soul</i>

01:25:06.853 --> 01:25:09.480
<i>I just say who got the blues
Say who got the blues</i>

01:25:09.481 --> 01:25:11.023

01:25:11.024 --> 01:25:13.835
<i>Castin' your spell on me</i>

01:25:23.703 --> 01:25:28.892
<i>Once upon a time
When I was in high school</i>

01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:36.482
<i>I was in love with you, lady
And you treated me so cool</i>

01:25:38.718 --> 01:25:44.282
<i>I was driving a Chevy '72</i>

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:51.331
<i>It had four on the floor,
girl 120 it would do</i>

01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:55.901
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

01:25:55.902 --> 01:26:01.090
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

01:26:08.623 --> 01:26:13.937
<i>And there was a war, baby
Somewhere across the sea</i>

01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:18.757
<i>I don't wanna go and fight, girl</i>

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:21.778
<i>'Cause you were really lovin' me</i>

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.910
<i>I remember Martin Luther King</i>

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:36.376
<i>Lord, he was the man, babe
That gave us all a dream</i>

01:26:36.776 --> 01:26:40.904
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:46.094
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

01:26:47.412 --> 01:26:50.098
<i>Don't play with my love</i>

01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:55.878
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

01:26:55.879 --> 01:27:01.067
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:13.997
<i>They used to have
sweet music in the park</i>

01:27:15.732 --> 01:27:21.379
<i>Lord, up at Monterey straight
down to the Melody Bar</i>

01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:29.220
<i>You used to wear, girl
Them hot pants</i>

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:36.352
<i>When you strolled down the hall
All the boys wanted a chance</i>

01:27:36.794 --> 01:27:40.923
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

01:27:40.924 --> 01:27:46.112
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:50.950
<i>Don't play with my love, oh</i>

01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:56.289
<i>I remember Otis Redding</i>

01:27:58.358 --> 01:28:01.127
<i>Sittin' at the Dock of the Bay</i>

01:28:02.362 --> 01:28:05.965
<i>But then he went away</i>

01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:11.971
<i>And I remember Sam Cooke, y'all</i>

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:16.350
<i>So Bring It on Home to Me</i>

01:28:17.377 --> 01:28:20.104
<i>From your love I can't be free</i>

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:26.486
<i>I remember Elvis Presley</i>

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:31.574
<i>And them Blue Suede Shoes</i>

01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:35.661
<i>Lord, they gave me the blues</i>
