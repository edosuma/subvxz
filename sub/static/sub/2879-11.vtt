WEBVTT

00:01.714 --> 00:04.267
Okay, now holding sides
of hearth in position,

00:04.269 --> 00:06.252
lower mantelpiece assembly

00:06.254 --> 00:09.222
onto top tabs.

00:09.224 --> 00:12.775
Look at that, I built a
fireplace with my own two hands.

00:12.777 --> 00:15.028
You're so butch.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.313
Aw, I got a little paper cut.

00:17.315 --> 00:19.232
Of course you did.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.434
Your hands are
softer than veal.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.154
Oh, before I forget,
Saturday I'm planning a little

00:25.156 --> 00:27.240
Dungeons and Dragons night
with the guys.

00:27.242 --> 00:29.492
Really? That's how you're gonna
spend your Saturday night?

00:29.494 --> 00:31.611
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get
a chance to play anymore.

00:31.613 --> 00:32.879
Oh, you poor thing.

00:32.881 --> 00:34.914
Is having a real-life girlfriend
who has sex with you

00:34.916 --> 00:37.750
getting in the way
of your board games?

00:37.752 --> 00:40.770
Little bit, yeah.

00:42.056 --> 00:45.558
Oh, great! I've always wanted
to play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.959
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry.

00:46.961 --> 00:48.895
I should've mentioned
this earlier.

00:48.897 --> 00:50.096
You're not invited.

00:51.682 --> 00:54.150
Why not?
Amy,

00:54.152 --> 00:57.637
from time to time,
we men need to break free

00:57.639 --> 01:00.907
from the shackles
of civility and get in touch

01:00.909 --> 01:04.277
with our primal
animalistic selves.

01:04.279 --> 01:06.563
By rolling dice
and playing make-believe

01:06.565 --> 01:08.047
with little figurines?

01:08.049 --> 01:10.416
Yeah, like a bunch of savages.

01:11.585 --> 01:13.503
Saturday night?

01:13.505 --> 01:15.038
But I've been working
late all week.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.205
That was gonna be our night.

01:16.207 --> 01:17.507
But I have to go.

01:17.509 --> 01:18.824
We play as a group.

01:18.826 --> 01:21.844
If-if I'm not there,
then everyone will blame you.

01:21.846 --> 01:24.264
They'll be all,
"Bernadette ruined everything.

01:24.266 --> 01:26.049
She's the worst."

01:27.318 --> 01:28.834
So, you see?

01:28.836 --> 01:32.138
I have to play
Dungeons and Dragons...

01:32.140 --> 01:34.307
for the marriage.

01:34.309 --> 01:37.176
You're an idiot.

01:37.178 --> 01:39.212
I'm your idiot.

01:39.214 --> 01:42.415
Forever.

01:42.417 --> 01:46.202
So, listen, I know we talked
about getting a bite to eat

01:46.204 --> 01:48.688
in Silver Lake, and then seeing
the Christmas lights

01:48.690 --> 01:51.457
in Griffith Park,
but Leonard's talking about

01:51.459 --> 01:53.793
a big D and D game at his place.

01:53.795 --> 01:56.496
Saturday night just went
from crazy to epic!

01:56.498 --> 01:57.830
Woo-hoo!

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

02:26.868 --> 02:29.737
All right, Sheldon,
to start our quest,

02:29.739 --> 02:32.323
you need to open this little
Christmas gift I got you.

02:32.325 --> 02:34.141
A Christmas gift?

02:34.143 --> 02:36.494
You know I don't
enjoy Christmas.

02:37.312 --> 02:38.829
What's wrong
with Christmas?

02:38.831 --> 02:40.064
Oh, where to begin?

02:40.066 --> 02:42.316
Trees indoors.

02:42.318 --> 02:45.970
Overuse of the words
"'tis" and "'twas."

02:45.972 --> 02:48.506
And the absurd custom
of one stocking.

02:48.508 --> 02:51.542
Everyone knows socks
belong in pas.

02:51.544 --> 02:53.010
Who uses one sock?

02:53.012 --> 02:55.479
Pirate with a peg leg?

02:55.481 --> 02:58.065
Actually that helps,
thank you.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.217
Would you just look inside?

03:01.988 --> 03:03.887
Oh, a scroll.

03:03.889 --> 03:05.272
I like scrolls.

03:05.274 --> 03:06.390
They're my third

03:06.392 --> 03:07.741
favorite system of transmitting

03:07.743 --> 03:09.243
the written word.

03:09.245 --> 03:12.029
After stone tablets
and skywriting.

03:12.864 --> 03:15.065
"You have all been
summoned to join

03:15.067 --> 03:17.334
"a thrilling Dungeons
and Dragons adventure.

03:17.336 --> 03:18.369
"Your quest begins

03:18.371 --> 03:20.955
"in a secret northern
village of elves

03:20.957 --> 03:22.706
who have all been massacred."

03:22.708 --> 03:24.842
I like
where this is heading.

03:24.844 --> 03:26.126
"Your task

03:26.128 --> 03:29.263
is to rescue their leader
from a dungeon of ogres."

03:29.265 --> 03:31.248
Oh, that's a saucy twist.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.466
"That leader's name:

03:32.468 --> 03:34.084
Santa Claus""

03:34.086 --> 03:36.270
No, no, no!

03:36.272 --> 03:37.938
It's actually, "Ho, ho, ho,"

03:37.940 --> 03:39.857
but you'll get the hang of it.

03:40.775 --> 03:41.942
Thought it'd be fun to make

03:41.944 --> 03:43.110
a quest with a holiday theme.

03:43.112 --> 03:44.278
Fun?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.397
Mixing Dungeons and Dragons
with Christmas is

03:46.399 --> 03:48.649
like making a sandwich
of grape jelly,

03:48.651 --> 03:49.950
the best-tasting jelly,

03:49.952 --> 03:53.571
and petroleum jelly,
the worst-tasting jelly.

03:53.573 --> 03:55.439
Okay, here we go.

03:55.441 --> 03:57.241
"You find yourselves

03:57.243 --> 03:59.443
"in the smoking remains
of Santa's village.

03:59.445 --> 04:02.129
Clearly, a great battle
has taken place."

04:02.131 --> 04:03.664
Oh, man, the first
monster I see,

04:03.666 --> 04:06.000
I'm gonna sneak up behind
him, whip out my wand,

04:06.002 --> 04:09.620
and shoot my magic
all over his ass.

04:11.706 --> 04:14.925
Do you hear yourself
when you say these things?

04:15.727 --> 04:16.860
Okay,

04:16.862 --> 04:18.394
there are ogre
tracks and a trail

04:18.397 --> 04:20.064
of broken candy
canes in the snow.

04:20.065 --> 04:21.098
Sheldon, what do you do?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.984
I signal my contempt
for your cruel plan

04:23.986 --> 04:25.653
to shove Christmas joy
down my throat

04:25.655 --> 04:29.806
by making a gesture that says,
"Get a load of this guy."

04:30.808 --> 04:32.276
Fine. Howard, what do you do?

04:32.278 --> 04:36.530
I follow the ogre tracks,
checking for secret doors

04:36.532 --> 04:38.499
along the way.

04:38.501 --> 04:41.368
And you discover a secret door
leading to a dark corridor.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.537
Okay, guys, let's make a plan:
spell casters in the back,

04:43.539 --> 04:44.788
warriors in the front...

04:44.790 --> 04:46.257
No, screw that noise,
I'm going in.

04:46.259 --> 04:49.826
Hang on, Santa,
I'm coming for you!

04:50.962 --> 04:53.847
Okay, you run into
a room full of weapons,

04:53.849 --> 04:55.449
hit a trip wire...

04:57.002 --> 04:59.770
...a cannon blows your face off,
you die, you're out of the game.

05:01.189 --> 05:03.190
But... a canon?

05:03.192 --> 05:05.175
Am I really out of the game?

05:05.177 --> 05:07.945
Lucky.

05:07.947 --> 05:09.196
Okay, come on, moving on.

05:09.198 --> 05:12.316
Wait, doesn't anyone have
a roof resurrection?

05:12.318 --> 05:16.186
Because if you've got
one, I need it bad.

05:17.855 --> 05:20.524
Get in here with your rod
and give it to me.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.227
Okay, you need
to say these things

05:23.229 --> 05:25.312
in your head before
you say them out loud.

05:26.449 --> 05:28.615
Hey, guys.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.200
I don't mean to interrupt
your little game,

05:30.202 --> 05:32.002
but I thought you'd like to see
what you're missing out on.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.053
So...

05:33.055 --> 05:35.306
Bernadette?

05:40.729 --> 05:43.230
Bernadette's wearing
leopard-print pumps

05:43.232 --> 05:46.383
and a rack-tastic red dress
from Forever 21.

05:52.407 --> 05:53.941
And there's Amy,

05:53.943 --> 05:55.609
showing all kinds of ankle.

05:56.778 --> 06:00.614
In an outfit I'm assuming is
from Forever 63.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.535
And I, myself...

06:06.738 --> 06:08.572
...am wearing a little
number that got me

06:08.574 --> 06:11.041
out of two speeding
tickets and jury duty.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.961
I know they're making
a rhetorical point,

06:13.963 --> 06:16.079
I just don't know what it is.

06:16.081 --> 06:17.931
See you, boys. We
are going drinking.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.683
Uh, wait,
can I come with you?

06:19.685 --> 06:21.985
My character died.

06:21.987 --> 06:24.104
Sorry, Raj,
it's girls' night out.

06:24.106 --> 06:26.223
Maybe another time.

06:28.728 --> 06:30.260
Okay...

06:30.262 --> 06:31.762
Come on.

06:31.764 --> 06:33.096
Ooh!

06:33.098 --> 06:37.100
Girls' night, girls' night!

06:39.254 --> 06:41.905
How does he not hear that?

06:44.209 --> 06:45.376
So, what's the plan?

06:45.378 --> 06:47.044
Are we gonna teach
our fellas a lesson

06:47.046 --> 06:49.413
by getting stinking drunk,
luring strange men

06:49.415 --> 06:51.331
into the bathroom,
and turning the toilet stall

06:51.333 --> 06:53.917
into a temple of the senses?

06:53.919 --> 06:55.386
No!
No!

06:55.388 --> 06:58.505
Geez, who's Forever 63 now?

06:59.891 --> 07:02.459
Can we get another bottle of
champagne for the table?

07:02.461 --> 07:03.460
Don't worry.

07:03.462 --> 07:04.961
It's my treat.

07:04.963 --> 07:06.230
Thanks.
Wow!

07:06.232 --> 07:07.765
You should come
to girls' night more often.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.349
And not just because
if you weren't here,

07:09.351 --> 07:11.635
this would be a can of Pabst.

07:11.637 --> 07:13.320
My pleasure; nothing
makes me happier

07:13.322 --> 07:14.988
than the chance
to spoil a lady.

07:14.990 --> 07:16.356
Just ask my dog.

07:16.358 --> 07:18.642
My vet says if I give her
any more foie gras,

07:18.644 --> 07:20.661
she's going to die of gout.

07:20.663 --> 07:23.864
Hey, let's help Raj
meet a girl tonight.

07:23.866 --> 07:26.316
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Okay, wait, are we talking

07:26.318 --> 07:29.086
one-night stand or do we want
to get him into a relationship?

07:29.088 --> 07:31.288
Let's get him laid!

07:32.207 --> 07:35.042
Stop it.
You're ruining girls' night.

07:36.294 --> 07:37.961
Raj, you're a great guy,

07:37.963 --> 07:40.347
you're in a bar full of
single women; let us help you.

07:40.349 --> 07:41.682
Yeah, you're
a real catch.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.267
I know you're shy,
but that doesn't mean

07:43.269 --> 07:45.052
you shouldn't have someone
wonderful in your life.

07:45.054 --> 07:46.386
That's sweet of you.

07:46.388 --> 07:47.671
But what can you do to help?

07:47.673 --> 07:49.106
We'll nose around,

07:49.108 --> 07:51.725
see if we can find a nice girl,
and then introduce you.

07:51.727 --> 07:53.009
Okay.

07:53.011 --> 07:54.394
Well, a couple of things.

07:54.396 --> 07:56.363
Don't tell them
I come from money.

07:56.365 --> 07:58.949
I want them to love me for me.

08:00.452 --> 08:02.686
They must be insanely hot.

08:04.072 --> 08:06.790
Like, nines or tens.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.575
Nines or tens?

08:08.577 --> 08:10.026
Okay, an eight is acceptable

08:10.028 --> 08:13.297
if she's willing to bring
another eight to the hot tub.

08:13.299 --> 08:14.798
Bottom line:
you'll take

08:14.800 --> 08:15.999
any woman who'll
have you, right?

08:16.001 --> 08:17.584
In a New Delhi minute.

08:19.687 --> 08:22.539
I don't remember you buying
these miniatures in my store.

08:22.541 --> 08:23.974
Oh, uh, yeah.

08:23.976 --> 08:26.059
I got 'em on Amazon.

08:26.061 --> 08:27.544
Sure. I get it.

08:27.546 --> 08:29.346
Why support a friend

08:29.348 --> 08:31.598
when you can support
a multinational conglomerate

08:31.600 --> 08:34.518
that is crushing the life
out of that friend?

08:34.520 --> 08:38.889
I know, but when I shop online,
I can do it on the toilet.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.222
Have you seen my store?

08:40.225 --> 08:41.741
The whole place is a toilet.

08:41.744 --> 08:44.227
C-Can we please move this along?

08:44.229 --> 08:45.262
Yeah, sorry.

08:45.264 --> 08:47.731
Uh, you come to the
end of the tunnel

08:47.733 --> 08:48.916
and find a large chest.

08:48.918 --> 08:49.917
What do you do?

08:49.919 --> 08:51.368
And, Howard, do not say,

08:51.370 --> 08:54.421
"I feel up the large chest."

08:54.423 --> 08:56.790
Excuse me,
I'm a married man now.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.242
I wasn't going to say
anything so juvenile.

08:59.244 --> 09:00.210
Great. What do you do?

09:00.212 --> 09:01.211
I walk up

09:01.213 --> 09:02.579
to the large chest,

09:02.581 --> 09:06.633
bury my face in it
and go.

09:09.537 --> 09:10.938
I open the chest.

09:10.940 --> 09:14.024
It's locked, but suddenly
the door behind you slams shut

09:14.026 --> 09:16.727
and now the walls of the room
start closing in.

09:16.729 --> 09:17.811
That's not good.

09:17.813 --> 09:20.531
My character and I
both have claustrophobia.

09:20.533 --> 09:23.099
Glowing letters appear
on the chest that read,

09:23.101 --> 09:25.602
"If squashed to death
you wish not to be,

09:25.604 --> 09:28.121
sing of Svaty Vaclav
and his victory."

09:28.123 --> 09:30.273
Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
Walls are getting closer.

09:30.275 --> 09:32.492
Oh, boy, happy place,
happy place.

09:32.494 --> 09:36.163
Wait, Svaty Vaclav was
the Duke of Bohemia.

09:36.165 --> 09:37.464
You're ten seconds away
from getting crushed!

09:37.466 --> 09:38.549
Nine, eight...

09:38.551 --> 09:39.550
What are we supposed to do?

09:39.552 --> 09:41.335
...seven, six...
Wait, wait.

09:41.337 --> 09:44.054
Svaty Vaclav is better known
as Good King Wenceslas

09:44.056 --> 09:45.839
from the beloved
Victorian Christmas carol.

09:45.841 --> 09:47.224
Never heard of it.

09:47.226 --> 09:49.593
Must be the one Christmas song
not written by a Jewish guy.

09:49.595 --> 09:51.728
...three, two...

09:51.730 --> 09:53.480
Somebody sing the damn song!

09:53.482 --> 09:54.898
♪ Good King Wenceslas
looked out ♪

09:54.900 --> 09:56.850

The walls stop! You're safe!

10:16.654 --> 10:17.704
That was amazing, Sheldon.

10:17.706 --> 10:19.456
How did you know that?
It was simple.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.842
I combined a well-known,
historical fact

10:21.844 --> 10:23.844
about Bohemia with the memory
of my grandparents,

10:23.846 --> 10:26.430
Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop,
singing Christmas carols

10:26.432 --> 10:29.016
while I sat in front of the fire
and tried to build

10:29.018 --> 10:31.718
a high-energy particle
accelerator out of Legos.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.054
Okay, continuing
our quest.

10:34.056 --> 10:35.155
W-W-Wait.

10:35.157 --> 10:36.440
There's still four more verses.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.191

10:58.095 --> 11:00.061
Looks like he's
doing pretty good.

11:00.063 --> 11:01.179
Of course he is.

11:01.181 --> 11:03.398
Look, that girl just got
dumped by her boyfriend.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.849
She's angry, she's drunk,

11:04.851 --> 11:06.985
and her favorite movie
is <i>Slumdog Millionaire.</i>

11:06.987 --> 11:07.969
I mean...

11:07.971 --> 11:10.471
That is some low-hanging fruit.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.124
Oh, here he comes.

11:13.126 --> 11:14.926
So, how'd it go?
Great.

11:14.928 --> 11:16.428
I bought her a couple
of drinks,

11:16.430 --> 11:18.296
and she gave me
her e-mail address.

11:18.298 --> 11:19.998
Ooh!

11:20.000 --> 11:25.286
"Jennifer@not-even-if-you-were-
the-last-guy-on-earth.loser""

11:26.122 --> 11:27.205
What?

11:27.207 --> 11:28.673
I'm sorry, Raj.

11:28.675 --> 11:31.259
Why can't I find someone?

11:31.261 --> 11:32.877
I'm smart, I've got a cool job,

11:32.879 --> 11:34.963
and my naturally
bronzed complexion

11:34.965 --> 11:36.464
means I can pull off
mustard yellow

11:36.466 --> 11:38.333
in a way most guys can't.

11:39.185 --> 11:41.335
Oh, honey,
it's not you, it's them.

11:41.337 --> 11:42.336
No, it's not.

11:42.338 --> 11:44.773
She was too beautiful for me.

11:44.775 --> 11:47.308
Why would you say that?
It's true.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.728
I'm always attracted
to women I can't have.

11:49.730 --> 11:51.062
I do it all the time.

11:51.064 --> 11:53.347
I did the same thing
with the two of you.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.066
The two of them?

11:55.068 --> 11:57.652
I don't understand.

11:57.654 --> 12:01.189
Well, uh, there was a time
when I had a thing for Penny,

12:01.191 --> 12:02.707
and I thought she
was into me, too,

12:02.709 --> 12:05.293
because she got drunk and naked
and climbed into bed with me.

12:05.295 --> 12:08.580
But apparently
I misread those signals.

12:10.082 --> 12:12.667
And you liked Bernadette also?

12:12.669 --> 12:14.586
That was before Penny.

12:14.588 --> 12:16.387
I make it a rule
to only fall for

12:16.389 --> 12:19.257
one of my friends'
girlfriends at a time.

12:19.259 --> 12:21.876
I'm very old-fashioned that way.

12:21.878 --> 12:24.646
So at, uh, some point,

12:24.648 --> 12:27.849
you probably had
a thing for me, too.

12:29.101 --> 12:31.402
No, not really.

12:33.355 --> 12:37.108
Oh, come on, Raj,
not even a little bit?

12:37.110 --> 12:39.727
Not that I can think of.

12:41.063 --> 12:43.731
Think harder.

12:44.566 --> 12:46.201
Nope.

12:47.236 --> 12:48.787
I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants.

12:48.789 --> 12:49.789
Or in this case, doesn't.

12:49.790 --> 12:52.590
I mean, at all.

12:55.044 --> 12:57.045
What?

12:59.098 --> 13:01.683
♪ Ye who now will
bless the poor ♪

13:01.685 --> 13:04.719
♪ Shall yourselves
find blessing ♪

13:04.721 --> 13:05.970
♪ Ba-da-bum.

13:07.273 --> 13:09.257
Done?

13:09.259 --> 13:12.760
I think the word you're
looking for is "bravo."

13:14.029 --> 13:15.930
Okay, you leave the room
and find yourself

13:15.932 --> 13:18.366
standing before a pool
of melted snowmen.

13:18.368 --> 13:19.617
Melted snowmen?

13:19.619 --> 13:21.786
Are there carrots
and lumps of coal in the water?

13:21.788 --> 13:23.071
I don't know.
What's the difference?

13:23.073 --> 13:25.290
It's a game of
the imagination, Leonard.

13:25.292 --> 13:26.274
Paint a picture.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.325
Fine.

13:27.327 --> 13:28.827
You leave the room
and find yourself

13:28.829 --> 13:30.545
standing before a pool
of melted snowmen.

13:30.547 --> 13:32.446
There are carrots and
lumps of coal in the water.

13:32.448 --> 13:35.300
What happened to the
top hats and the corncob pipes?

13:35.302 --> 13:37.051
You see those, too.

13:37.053 --> 13:39.787
Oh, it's like I'm really there.

13:41.957 --> 13:45.459
I gotta tell you, this-this is
the most holiday fun I've had

13:45.461 --> 13:48.629
since my therapist changed
my anxiety medication

13:48.631 --> 13:51.465
and I stopped caring about
the blood in my stool.

13:53.819 --> 13:55.803
Good story.

13:56.739 --> 13:58.022
What are you drinking there?

13:58.024 --> 13:59.073
Little eggnog?

13:59.075 --> 14:00.325
Yes.

14:00.327 --> 14:01.609
What, is there a problem?

14:01.611 --> 14:04.662
No, it's nice to see you
enjoying a holiday beverage.

14:04.664 --> 14:05.813
Pretty Christmasy.

14:05.815 --> 14:08.249
Since when is eggnog
a Christmas drink?

14:09.651 --> 14:11.286
Eggs are available
all year 'round.

14:11.288 --> 14:14.539
I've been known to
enjoy this poolside.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.624
Come on, Sheldon.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.659
You know all the Christmas
stories, and the carols,

14:18.661 --> 14:20.879
you've got an eggnog
mustache going on there.

14:20.881 --> 14:22.163
Just admit it.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.765
You're getting
a little Yuletide spirit.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.266
Oh, don't be silly.

14:25.268 --> 14:28.186
Christmas is a bunch of baloney
created by the tinsel industry.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.005
Why is this so important to you?

14:31.007 --> 14:33.107
Honestly, because I had enough
crappy Christmases as a kid

14:33.109 --> 14:35.193
and I'm tired of you
sucking the joy out of them now.

14:35.195 --> 14:37.028
What was so bad
about them?

14:37.030 --> 14:39.948
I grew up in a house
full of crazy academics.

14:39.950 --> 14:42.150
Instead of leaving Santa
milk and cookies,

14:42.152 --> 14:44.452
we had to leave him
a research paper.

14:46.155 --> 14:48.356
And in the morning,
you could tell he'd been there

14:48.358 --> 14:50.124
because the paper
would be graded.

14:51.293 --> 14:52.794
No wonder you love Christmas.

14:52.796 --> 14:55.046
That sounds amazing.

14:55.048 --> 14:57.031
It wasn't amazing.

14:57.033 --> 14:59.867
I got a C-minus
four years in a row.

14:59.869 --> 15:01.369
Yeah, I'm familiar
with your work.

15:01.371 --> 15:02.720
C-minus was your gift.

15:05.808 --> 15:08.559
Amy, I'm really sorry.

15:08.561 --> 15:10.311
I didn't mean to upset you.

15:10.313 --> 15:11.646
It's fine.

15:11.648 --> 15:13.881
I'm used to being the girl
who never gets looked at twice.

15:13.883 --> 15:16.901
I didn't have my first kiss
till I was 22,

15:16.903 --> 15:20.054
and the guy only did it so
I'd give him back his insulin.

15:22.241 --> 15:26.444
Sometimes the pancreas wants
what the pancreas wants.

15:27.279 --> 15:28.613
Forget it.

15:28.615 --> 15:30.164
I don't expect
you guys to understand.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.749
I understand.

15:31.751 --> 15:33.751
In seventh grade,
I played Spin the Bottle

15:33.753 --> 15:35.403
and it landed on Alina Shankar.

15:35.405 --> 15:37.038
She said if I came near her,

15:37.040 --> 15:39.657
she would break
the bottle and cut me.

15:39.659 --> 15:41.209
You think that's bad?

15:41.211 --> 15:43.244
In college, I passed out
at a frat party

15:43.246 --> 15:45.680
and woke up with
more clothes on.

15:49.802 --> 15:51.469
Sometimes I get so lonely,

15:51.471 --> 15:53.855
I sit on my left hand
until it goes numb,

15:53.857 --> 15:56.107
then I put it in
my right hand and pretend

15:56.109 --> 15:58.592
I'm holding hands
with another person.

15:58.594 --> 16:01.562
I do that, too.

16:01.564 --> 16:03.764
Sometimes the left hand
tries to cop a feel.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.785
And I let it.

16:09.371 --> 16:12.206
It's kind of nice
to talk to someone

16:12.208 --> 16:14.459
who understands what
it feels like to be alone.

16:14.461 --> 16:16.744
It is, isn't it?

16:16.746 --> 16:18.612
But you're not alone anymore.
Now you've got Sheldon.

16:18.614 --> 16:19.914
I do.

16:19.916 --> 16:22.967
And don't worry, someday
you'll have somebody, too.

16:22.969 --> 16:24.335
Thank you.

16:24.337 --> 16:28.256
I hope she's half as
lovely and amazing as you are.

16:29.124 --> 16:31.676
Thank you, Rajesh.

16:31.678 --> 16:33.594
He wants me, I'm good.
We can go now.

16:35.964 --> 16:36.981
Damn it.

16:36.983 --> 16:38.349
What?

16:38.351 --> 16:40.184
Now that I know
she doesn't like me,

16:40.186 --> 16:42.286
I'm kind of into her.

16:43.472 --> 16:45.556
All right.

16:45.558 --> 16:49.394
I think I cracked the code
to lower the drawbridge.

16:49.396 --> 16:50.811
Great.
Let's do it.

16:57.753 --> 16:59.203
The drawbridge is lowering.

17:05.544 --> 17:07.045
My carpal tunnel's acting up.

17:07.047 --> 17:08.463
Play through
the pain!

17:19.674 --> 17:21.692
You did it!
The drawbridge is down.

17:21.694 --> 17:23.277
You cross the chasm

17:23.279 --> 17:26.114
and find yourself in
a small dungeon room.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.766
And in the corner,
chained to the wall,

17:28.768 --> 17:31.352
you see a bloodied and beaten
Santa Claus.

17:31.354 --> 17:35.022
He says, "Ho, ho, help me."

17:35.024 --> 17:37.542
Yes, we found Santa!

17:37.544 --> 17:39.544
Christmas is saved!

17:39.546 --> 17:42.213
Don't ever tell
my mother I said that.

17:43.298 --> 17:45.199
I take out
my skeleton key

17:45.201 --> 17:46.968
and run to Santa
to unchain him.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.970
But first, I cast
a spell of paralysis

17:48.972 --> 17:51.422
on Stuart and Howard.
Wait, what are you doing?

17:51.424 --> 17:53.741
You can't talk;
you're paralyzed.

17:53.743 --> 17:57.678
I get right up in Santa's
big, fat face and say...

17:57.680 --> 17:59.213
Well, well, well,

17:59.215 --> 18:01.899
jolly old Saint Nick,
we meet again.

18:01.901 --> 18:03.584
Yeah, I believe
the last time we spoke

18:03.586 --> 18:06.654
was in the Baybrook Mall
in Galveston, Texas,

18:06.656 --> 18:08.906
when I was five years old,
isn't that right?

18:08.908 --> 18:11.125
Uh, okay.

18:11.127 --> 18:12.560
My mother
dragged me there

18:12.562 --> 18:14.445
and she plopped me
down on your lap

18:14.447 --> 18:16.747
and you asked me
what I wanted for Christmas.

18:16.749 --> 18:18.699
And I told you "my Pop-Pop,"

18:18.701 --> 18:21.235
because that was the year
my grandfather died.

18:21.237 --> 18:24.071
I missed him
and I wanted him back.

18:24.923 --> 18:27.425
This is weird, right?

18:30.429 --> 18:32.346
Pop-Pop was the only one
in my family

18:32.348 --> 18:34.215
who encouraged me
to pursue science.

18:34.217 --> 18:36.417
But you didn't bring
him back, did you?

18:36.419 --> 18:39.137
Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.

18:39.139 --> 18:43.090
Well, you can build a lot of
neat things out of Lincoln Logs,

18:43.092 --> 18:44.942
but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em.

18:44.944 --> 18:48.262
And now you're here
asking me for something--

18:48.264 --> 18:49.597
to save you.

18:49.599 --> 18:53.934
Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle,
but today's not your day.

18:53.936 --> 18:55.486
I'm leaving you here to rot,

18:55.488 --> 18:58.156
and I hope the ogres
feast on your bones.

18:58.158 --> 19:01.709
I take the skeleton key,
and I toss it into the chasm,

19:01.711 --> 19:03.711
and on the way out, I give Santa

19:03.713 --> 19:06.747
a swift kick in his
bowl full of jelly!

19:08.050 --> 19:10.468
Okay.

19:10.470 --> 19:13.671
So Wolowitz and Stuart
are paralyzed, Santa's dead,

19:13.673 --> 19:17.124
and I picked this over
having sex with my girlfriend.

19:35.283 --> 19:36.583
Santa?

19:36.585 --> 19:41.071
Oh, hello, Sheldon.

19:41.073 --> 19:43.290
You should be asleep.

19:43.292 --> 19:45.408
Well, then, you shouldn't have
jingle bells on your boots.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.660
Oh...

19:47.461 --> 19:50.113
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

19:50.115 --> 19:54.301
I'm sorry I disappointed you
when you were a little boy.

19:55.102 --> 19:58.788
I-I can do a lot
of magical things,

19:58.790 --> 20:03.343
but unfortunately bringing your
Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.

20:04.178 --> 20:06.296
I understand.

20:06.298 --> 20:09.683
But I-I do have
something special for you.

20:10.534 --> 20:12.302
Close your eyes.

20:14.155 --> 20:16.639
Oh, I hope it's a train.

20:16.641 --> 20:19.826
Oh, it's better than a train.

20:19.828 --> 20:23.079
Two trains?

20:23.081 --> 20:24.814
Better.

20:24.816 --> 20:27.000
I'm getting three trains.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.870
Okay, open 'em.

20:34.425 --> 20:36.659
This is for leaving me
in the dungeon

20:36.661 --> 20:39.512
to be eaten alive by ogres!

20:39.514 --> 20:40.964
Wait, uh, uh, hang on.

20:40.966 --> 20:42.048
I-In my defense...

20:42.050 --> 20:44.551
Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork!
