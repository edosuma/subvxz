<i>You got</i> a <i>cloudy Monday ahead today</i>

00:58.740 --> 01:00.265
<i>here in the nation's capital.</i>

01:00.340 --> 01:04.947
<i>Chance of rain showers and a likely
chance of some drizzle that continues...</i>

01:05.060 --> 01:08.428
<i>With President Nixon
facing an uncertain re-election,</i>

01:08.500 --> 01:11.185
<i>candidates for the Democratic Party
are accusing him</i>

01:11.260 --> 01:14.423
<i>of failing to end
American involvement in Vietnam.</i>

01:15.420 --> 01:17.582
<i>Members of the Committee
to re-elect the President</i>

01:17.700 --> 01:21.022
<i>were in Jacksonville today
on their campaign trip through Florida.</i>

01:21.100 --> 01:24.104
<i>And for a report on that,
here's Georgia Wilson.</i>

01:24.180 --> 01:27.229
<i>Wife of the Attorney
General, Mrs. Richard Kleindienst.</i>

01:29.420 --> 01:30.626
<i>This is the final weekend</i>

01:30.700 --> 01:32.623
<i>of our month-long extravaganza sale.</i>

01:33.420 --> 01:35.343
<i>All sizes all on sale!</i>

01:35.420 --> 01:37.946
<i>In Washington,
yet another public demonstration</i>

01:38.020 --> 01:40.785
<i>by some citizens
opposed to the Vietnam War.</i>

01:41.140 --> 01:42.949
<i>Reporter Alan Witten.</i>

01:43.140 --> 01:45.950
<i>It was festive
as the crowd turned to Capitol Hill.</i>

01:46.100 --> 01:49.229
<i>In an hour's time,
several thousand people had joined hands</i>

01:49.300 --> 01:53.589
<i>to form a complete circle of war protest
around the US Capitol.</i>

02:01.940 --> 02:04.540
<i>Clean and Shine
to the rescue! Cleans up stains,</i>

02:04.620 --> 02:08.544
<i>only the shine remains. No rubbing.
No trimming, no foul smells.</i>

02:08.620 --> 02:11.703
<i>A sharp recession
has shaken economic confidence.</i>

02:11.780 --> 02:14.989
<i>As a result, a large field of
Democratic challengers has emerged</i>

02:15.060 --> 02:17.904
<i>and would beat Nixon
if the election were held today.</i>

02:17.980 --> 02:20.267
<i>- Five different flavors!
- Five different meals!</i>

02:20.340 --> 02:22.422
<i>One happy family!</i>

03:41.780 --> 03:45.341
<i>One, two, three, four!
We don't want your fucking war!</i>

03:45.580 --> 03:49.301
<i>One, two, three, four!
We don't want your fucking war!</i>

03:52.660 --> 03:55.061
Mark Fell'.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.705
Gentlemen. Mr. Dean.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.028
Goddamn Russian revolution out there.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.590
Why aren't we arresting anybody?

04:08.820 --> 04:11.221
Because that isn't a crime.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.903
Right now the president
needs your advice.

04:16.980 --> 04:20.427
Yeah, Hoover's run the FBI,
what, 40 years?

04:20.500 --> 04:23.185
- Fifty.
- Fifty goddamn years.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.703
You know, Johnson and Kennedy
wanted to fire him, don't you?

04:27.020 --> 04:28.260
But they didn't have the balls.

04:28.460 --> 04:33.466
If the president were to ask
Mr. Hoover to step aside,

04:34.260 --> 04:36.024
how would you suggest he do it?

04:38.700 --> 04:41.351
We know you to be a friend
to this administration.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.060
We like to see our friends
get what they deserve.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.349
- You're next in line.
- There is no line, Mr. Mitchell.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.663
The president is asking.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.822
Mr. Hoover would want to keep
his bullet-proof car.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.626
You're a real politician, Felt.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.502
Then thanks for popping by.

05:09.820 --> 05:10.981
If I may.

05:13.220 --> 05:17.225
There is one thing Mr. Hoover knows
that's been on all your minds.

05:20.220 --> 05:24.020
Whenever the FBI hears
a piece of gossip or information,

05:24.100 --> 05:29.266
such as "I saw so-and-so out
with another woman, not his wife,"

05:29.860 --> 05:33.069
or a man, not his wife,

05:33.820 --> 05:36.266
we're supposed
to write everything down, and we do.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.229
We write it all down in memos.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.184
These memos come to me,

05:41.300 --> 05:44.861
and I decide what information
Mr. Hoover needs to know,

05:45.140 --> 05:47.302
and send that up to Mr. Hoover.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.148
And Mr. Hoover puts it all away
in his private files,

05:52.260 --> 05:54.069
to be kept safe,

05:54.180 --> 05:57.263
out of the hands of people
without discretion,

05:57.340 --> 06:01.982
people who could do harm should that
information be leaked, for instance,

06:02.100 --> 06:05.309
and put before
the court of public opinion.

06:06.860 --> 06:10.023
And then sometimes Mr. Hoover
will go, for instance,

06:10.100 --> 06:13.786
to the president's closest aides
and say,

06:14.300 --> 06:17.747
Mr. Ehrlichman or Mr. Mitchell,

06:17.820 --> 06:20.346
"I want you to know
that we received that report

06:20.420 --> 06:22.024
"about you and that other woman,

06:22.100 --> 06:26.071
"and I want to tell you
that there is absolutely no reason

06:26.180 --> 06:28.990
"for us to take any further action.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.461
"There is no violation.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.543
"You're safe.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.270
"We, the FBI...

06:37.340 --> 06:41.026
"All your secrets are safe with us."

06:45.540 --> 06:47.668
How long have you been in the FBI, Felt?

06:48.300 --> 06:49.665
Thirty years.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.629
Thirty years.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.949
That's a lot of information,
a lot of files.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.021
Thank you, Mr. Felt.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.991
Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Dean.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.826
Choke on your Manhattan.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.068
Have a little something.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.662
- Hello, darling.
- Hey, sweetie.

07:20.740 --> 07:25.064
I give you the chief dragon slayer
and guardian of the American dream.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.869
Oh, come on, Mark.
Crack a smile, at least!

07:31.060 --> 07:32.186
Eddie, let me go.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.661
Eddie, leave her alone.
She's the best. Come here, you.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.145
- Did you hear that?
- I need a drink.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.460
- I am the best.
- I heard that.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.707
- Hi, hon.
- Hi, sweetie.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.226
- Look what I've done.
- Look what you're doing.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.301
What were you doing?

07:52.220 --> 07:53.506
Yes, sir.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.662
Keep the hips down.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.185
Look at your feet.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.501
Come on, attitude.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.270
Eddie, they're elegant!

09:19.020 --> 09:21.102
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.542
- Is the director in?
- Not yet.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.302
Here's that Weather Underground file.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.590
- How many bombings now?
- Couple dozen.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.583
Precise numbers, Mr. Miller.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.866
Twenty-nine.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.669
Nails and ball bearings.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.987
These kids aren't messing around.

10:01.420 --> 10:03.229
They're embarrassing the FBI.

10:04.420 --> 10:05.990
Get the New York office.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.381
He's dead.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.181
Who?

10:12.220 --> 10:13.710
Mr. Hoover's dead.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.022
His housekeeper found him on the floor.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.949
He wasn't breathing.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.068
It looks like a stroke.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.229
Put everything into motion.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.344
No mistakes, gentlemen. Not one.

11:19.820 --> 11:20.821
Good morning, Felt.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.823
The assistant Attorney General.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.106
Pat Gray.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.269
Complicated morning for all of us.

11:26.340 --> 11:29.947
Indeed. Mr. Miller, here, will be
handling the funeral arrangements.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.705
I have the Attorney General's
instructions on seating and protocol.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.270
The funeral will be handled by the FBI.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.741
The Attorney General
will sit beside the vice president.

11:36.820 --> 11:39.869
Handled by the FBI
in its own way, Mr. Gray.

11:42.340 --> 11:45.264
I also have instructions
on Mr. Hoover's files.

11:45.380 --> 11:48.429
I am to take possession of them
and bring them to the White House.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.583
What files?

11:53.420 --> 11:56.981
Mr. Hoover's secret files.
The Personal and Confidentials.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.463
Official and Confidentials.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.542
There are no secret files.

12:47.420 --> 12:52.631
<i>We thank thee this day
with arms open for J. Edgar Hoover,</i>

12:52.980 --> 12:55.665
for his lifelong trust in thee,

12:55.820 --> 12:58.426
his steadfast devotion to the nation,

12:58.700 --> 13:00.987
his elevated patriotism,

13:01.340 --> 13:04.981
his commitment to justice
and peace in the nation.

13:07.780 --> 13:09.782
We ask that we may be as strong,

13:10.940 --> 13:13.511
- brave as he was brave...
- Excuse me.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.385
- Loyal as he was loyal...
- Pardon me.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.542
Serve as he sewed,

13:18.900 --> 13:22.666
love the nation as he loved it.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.220
Felt!

13:42.020 --> 13:43.624
Jesus. Bill Sullivan.

13:45.980 --> 13:47.789
I'd like a word with you.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.823
Bill Sullivan and Mark Felt,
together again.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.061
Who would have thought it?

13:57.140 --> 13:59.108
I think I was the one
who recommended you to the old man

13:59.180 --> 14:00.261
for your first big promotion.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.310
- You know you were.
- That's right. Mark Felt never forgets.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.265
That's why everyone likes you.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.350
Hell, I even like you.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.865
And I don't like anybody.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.470
What do you want?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.342
I had 30 years in the bureau.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.504
Same as you.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.582
- You were the director's bag man.
- Oh, yeah?

14:19.660 --> 14:22.027
You taped Martin Luther King
with other women

14:22.100 --> 14:24.341
and sent the pictures to his wife.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.023
Do you need me to actually say it?

14:28.140 --> 14:31.189
Those days were gone. You had to go.

14:33.900 --> 14:38.667
You could be you, Mark,
only because I was who I was.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.862
You and I were an ecosystem.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.147
That's how nature works.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.263
Keeps everything in a balance.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.024
Now, the king is dead.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.230
Long live the king.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.544
- Are you the new king?
- You tell me.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.551
You're the president's new best friend.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.751
Mark Felt.

15:05.940 --> 15:09.228
Integrity, bravery, fidelity.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.104
Ladies and gentlemen, the G-man's G-man.

15:11.380 --> 15:14.463
You want to know what everybody
really thinks of you? Do you?

15:15.180 --> 15:19.230
Competent, reliable, loyal.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.382
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.508
If you're a golden retriever.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.061
Hoover's gone.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.270
You're alone now,

15:32.540 --> 15:35.908
holding the end of your own leash.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.660
Attorney General, <i>line</i> one-

16:08.700 --> 16:09.747
Dick.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.140
Yes.

16:14.260 --> 16:17.343
Well, I have enjoyed every day of it.

16:17.420 --> 16:22.187
The FBI has been home to me
and my family for 30 years and...

16:23.340 --> 16:24.387
Yes.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.870
"A new day."

16:36.460 --> 16:39.145
Yes, a fresh start.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.866
It's what I would do.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.302
Who do you have in mind?

16:49.340 --> 16:52.264
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Who?

16:57.300 --> 17:00.349
- Welcome to the FBI.
- A friendly face.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.740
Gentlemen.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.825
Now, Mr. Gray.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.949
I know the bureau
has its closets and skeletons.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.626
You can count on me
to keep those doors shut.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.704
I'll be candid with you.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.862
I was a submarine commander in the navy.

17:13.980 --> 17:17.621
I was father, confessor and friend
to 18-year-olds.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.310
Did you know that?

17:20.020 --> 17:22.182
I'm not a suspicious man by nature.

17:22.260 --> 17:25.025
That probably makes me
a strange choice to run the FBI.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.069
In fact,
when the president called my wife

17:28.180 --> 17:30.148
she begged me to turn him down, but...

17:32.020 --> 17:35.024
But the president wasn't asking,
if you know what I mean.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.344
Now, let me be candid with you,
Mr. Gray.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.387
The FBI is the most respected
institution in the world.

17:44.460 --> 17:47.464
It is one of the two cockpits
that fly America,

17:47.540 --> 17:51.784
and it is what it is because no one
from the outside ever got inside.

17:54.020 --> 17:56.182
Mr. Hoover has been old, a long time.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.183
We all know it's been you
running the FBI, Felt.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.706
- Your reputation is stellar.
- Let me finish.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.505
You have no law enforcement experience.
You're an outsider.

18:04.740 --> 18:08.267
That is your battle to fight,
but I'm going to help you.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.104
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Don't.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.627
It's not an act of generosity.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.830
This is about this building
and what goes on in here

18:15.900 --> 18:17.789
and what it means to the country.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.670
That is all I care about.

18:20.340 --> 18:23.583
As long as you keep the FBI first,

18:23.740 --> 18:25.742
you'll be able to count on me.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.950
This is your office.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.622
I thought the job was yours.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.629
What did I miss?

19:15.180 --> 19:17.308
You and Mr. Hoover.

19:20.580 --> 19:24.710
Don't you remember
why he said he liked you so much?

19:25.140 --> 19:29.509
He always said
you and he had the same enemies.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.704
That's why.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.191
Thirty years.

19:44.860 --> 19:46.544
Thirteen transfers.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.184
Thirteen homes to leave.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.386
Thirteen homes to make.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.664
I left behind every friend I ever made.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.947
And I kept my mouth shut,

20:03.020 --> 20:05.341
like the perfect little FBI wife.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.945
Until one day you wake up

20:09.020 --> 20:10.704
and you're so different
than you used to be

20:10.780 --> 20:14.182
you can't even remember
what the point was in the first place.

20:16.020 --> 20:20.025
Till there's just one thing
left in my head.

20:21.060 --> 20:26.464
The one idea left in my head is,
at least Mark's going to get that job.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.991
- And that will make up for everything.
- Audrey.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.348
They don't deserve you.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.501
They don't deserve us.

20:41.180 --> 20:42.750
You need to resign.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.506
When the bureau is in better hands,

21:12.900 --> 21:14.550
then, I'll go.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.747
- What is <i>it?
- This is getting complicated.</i>

21:34.900 --> 21:36.709
<i>You better get down here.</i>

21:36.940 --> 21:40.023
<i>Five men wearing white gloves
and carrying cameras</i>

21:40.100 --> 21:41.909
<i>were caught early today
in the headquarters</i>

21:41.980 --> 21:44.790
<i>of the Democratic National Committee,
in Washington.</i>

21:44.860 --> 21:46.100
<i>They apparently were unarmed</i>

21:46.180 --> 21:49.423
<i>and nobody knows yet
why they were even there.</i>

22:07.620 --> 22:09.031
Mr. Kunkel.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.069
Straight into the Democrat offices
in the Watergate.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.110
Who's our spy?

22:16.180 --> 22:17.864
Baldwin, Alfred C.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.022
Checked in six weeks ago.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.023
Says he was more than just the lookout.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.180
He says he was supposed
to listen for "girlie stuff."

22:24.300 --> 22:26.701
Guess the Dems are having
a lot of trouble with their wives.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.464
He say where he got his instructions?

22:28.540 --> 22:30.542
Baldwin is one of ours.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.223
EX-FBI.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.505
He worked under Bill Sullivan.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.701
When he was in the bureau,
was he in Mr. Sullivan's group?

22:39.140 --> 22:40.346
We think so.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.343
What about CIA connections?

22:42.420 --> 22:43.751
No idea. Why?

22:44.300 --> 22:47.588
Because 30 minutes ago
four of those burglars told a judge

22:47.660 --> 22:49.662
they are ex-CIA.

22:51.380 --> 22:53.223
What the hell is this?

22:54.580 --> 22:56.981
<i>One of the most fascinating
and exotic stories</i>

22:57.060 --> 22:58.903
<i>ever to come out of Washington, DC,</i>

22:58.980 --> 23:01.062
<i>was the talk of the capital today.</i>

23:01.140 --> 23:03.188
<i>Robert Endicott covered the story.</i>

23:03.300 --> 23:05.826
<i>Democratic officials today
held a series of meetings</i>

23:05.900 --> 23:07.504
<i>to talk about tighter security</i>

23:07.580 --> 23:09.070
<i>at the national headquarters
here in Washington.</i>

23:09.140 --> 23:11.302
<i>The White House
has so far offered no official comment,</i>

23:11.380 --> 23:14.987
<i>but a close adviser to the president,
seen here visiting China last month,</i>

23:15.060 --> 23:17.506
<i>has said the president
is most concerned about the break-in</i>

23:17.580 --> 23:20.709
<i>and will be keeping
a very close eye on the investigation.</i>

23:20.780 --> 23:22.544
<i>Now, turning to other news...</i>

23:24.020 --> 23:25.670
Mr. Lano is running street on this.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.549
2:15, Sunday morning,

23:28.620 --> 23:32.102
Metro finds our perps inside the
Democratic National Committee office.

23:32.420 --> 23:35.549
We ID'd the lead. He's a pro.

23:35.620 --> 23:39.022
Five years in the FBI, 19 in the CIA.

23:39.940 --> 23:43.228
Then he left the CIA to run security
for the Attorney General.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.981
Then he ran security for the White House

23:46.060 --> 23:47.869
for the Committee
to Re-elect the President.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.351
The lead burglar ran security

23:49.420 --> 23:50.706
for the Committee
to Re-elect the President?

23:50.780 --> 23:53.784
- Is that what you said?
- That's what he said. Keep going.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.100
Yeah, it gets weirder.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.700
The lookout in here, three years FBI.

23:57.780 --> 24:01.387
Then the Attorney General recruits him
to be his wife's personal bodyguard.

24:06.260 --> 24:07.500
Just keep going.

24:07.660 --> 24:10.266
The lookout makes
a Howard Hunt the ringleader.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.264
Hunt's also ex-CIA.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.341
But get this,

24:13.540 --> 24:15.304
a year ago we were asked to do
a background check

24:15.380 --> 24:16.541
on Hunt for a government job.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.748
- Did we clear him?
- Yeah.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.948
For a job at the White House

24:21.020 --> 24:24.820
as a "consultant on highly sensitive,
confidential matters."

24:26.460 --> 24:27.586
That's a job title?

24:32.380 --> 24:35.065
White House, Justice and the CIA

24:35.140 --> 24:37.746
are gonna want to know
everything we know.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.666
But we aren't going to tell them.
Anything.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.709
The Attorney General already called.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.823
Nobody talks to the Attorney General.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.744
- We answer to the Attorney General.
- You answer to me.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.949
What about the director?

24:53.220 --> 24:55.427
I'll take care of the director.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.866
<i>There is still no explanation
why the Watergate suspects</i>

24:58.940 --> 25:01.420
<i>might have attempted
to bug Democratic headquarters.</i>

25:01.500 --> 25:03.867
<i>A spokesman for the Attorney General
said yesterday</i>

25:03.940 --> 25:05.863
<i>that the FBI is already investigating.</i>

25:05.940 --> 25:09.342
<i>Their report will be turned over to the
criminal division for appropriate...</i>

25:31.100 --> 25:35.025
John Dean, the president's counsel,
just went into the director's office.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.586
- Let me know when he comes out.
- Yes, Mr. Felt.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.020
Mr. Dean has <i>left.</i>

25:53.180 --> 25:55.182
<i>The director's leaving in a bit
to play golf.</i>

26:01.900 --> 26:04.551
What's John Dean
doing here in this building?

26:08.500 --> 26:12.221
This is a remarkable amount
of information

26:12.580 --> 26:14.105
about the break-in.

26:14.180 --> 26:17.309
We're still gathering string.
This is just the beginning.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.270
Okay.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.026
First of all,
there are no more interviews

26:24.140 --> 26:27.349
with White House or CIA people
without permission.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.865
- What?
- Whose permission?

26:32.140 --> 26:33.665
Give us a minute.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.509
Get out.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.868
The FBI is an independent body.

26:44.980 --> 26:45.981
I'm aware of that.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.865
Are you also aware that means
we don't need permission

26:48.940 --> 26:51.022
to do anything from anybody?

26:51.780 --> 26:55.387
You give that up just one time,
you don't ever get it back. Ever.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.428
Let's not get dramatic.
We don't even know what this is.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.423
That's right. We don't.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.151
But we're going to find out.
That's what we do.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.022
You don't work for them.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.671
You're the director of the FBI now.

27:17.780 --> 27:19.464
Forty-eight hours.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.662
We put the investigation to bed
and get on with the rest of our lives

27:25.060 --> 27:26.710
in two days.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.702
You've got 48 hours.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.751
Thank you.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.664
Nice to see you.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.504
What brings you back?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.025
Two words.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.864
Re... Venge.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.025
Was everything all right, Daniel?

29:10.100 --> 29:11.306
It's great as always.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.661
Your total's going to be $47.70.

29:13.740 --> 29:14.980
Thanks, darlin'.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.950
There you go.
I'll see you next time.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.585
Say hi to your mama.

29:26.820 --> 29:28.629
You look like hell.

29:31.580 --> 29:32.820
Have some food.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.107
- How are you, sir?
- Just coffee, thanks.

29:38.100 --> 29:42.424
So, what does this look like
to you, Sandy,

29:42.500 --> 29:44.229
and your pals at Time magazine?

29:44.300 --> 29:46.029
Oh, the Watergate thing?

29:48.380 --> 29:49.586
Honestly, I...

29:51.220 --> 29:54.144
No one at Time magazine or any newspaper
I know can figure it out.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.870
Ex-spooks get caught planting bugs?

30:04.620 --> 30:06.987
Does have a particular
odor to it though.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.540
I bet your old pal Bill Sullivan
sure misses the FBI.

30:23.420 --> 30:27.505
Because I heard the White House
gave him some bullshit job,

30:27.580 --> 30:28.991
waiting for Hoover to kick off.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.948
Sullivan wants back in.

30:32.100 --> 30:35.422
The president wants him back in
to run the FBI their way.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.542
Nixon and Sullivan.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.910
Those two were made for each other.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.105
Here you go.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.464
Could we have some pie, please?

30:54.820 --> 30:57.266
What kind?
We have apple, blueberry...

30:57.340 --> 30:58.466
You pick.

31:00.460 --> 31:02.462
What are we doing out here, Mark?

31:05.100 --> 31:06.989
I was given 48 hours.

31:08.980 --> 31:10.311
To do what?

31:11.980 --> 31:14.347
Wrap up the Watergate investigation.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.661
BY Who?

31:20.700 --> 31:22.225
Gray?

31:24.700 --> 31:27.749
Pat Gray, the director of the FBI,

31:28.620 --> 31:31.430
ordered the FBI
to stop its own investigation?

31:32.420 --> 31:34.502
There are calls
we are not allowed to make

31:34.580 --> 31:37.470
and phone and bank records
we can't go near.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.550
Thank you.

31:56.500 --> 32:01.108
In all the years I've known you,
you've never given up a single,

32:01.220 --> 32:03.029
real secret.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.149
Nothing but the company line.

32:13.020 --> 32:15.466
These are uncharted waters for you.

32:20.860 --> 32:22.942
So, one more time. What are we doing?

32:24.060 --> 32:26.108
You looking for a little help?

32:27.140 --> 32:28.187
Payback?

32:28.940 --> 32:31.671
I want the FBI left alone to do its job.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.109
That's all I want.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.111
And you want me to light a fire
around the edges

32:40.140 --> 32:41.141
with a story.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.747
Well, I can see why
they didn't give you the job.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.342
They must be terrified of you.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.026
<i>- Come on, come on.
- Washington Post.</i>

34:00.500 --> 34:03.151
I miss you.
I know I'm not supposed to say that.

34:04.660 --> 34:07.027
- It's okay to say that.
- No.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.750
It's too touchy-feely.

34:10.739 --> 34:12.788
I need you too much.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.663
Where were you tonight?

34:16.860 --> 34:19.181
The switchboard said
they didn't know where you were.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.266
Because I didn't tell them.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.183
Well, what about Mrs. Tschudy?

34:24.780 --> 34:26.190
She didn't know either.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.543
But you taught her
to always say that, didn't you?

34:39.139 --> 34:41.541
Have you been making the calls
about Joan?

34:43.020 --> 34:44.670
I've called all her friends.

34:45.100 --> 34:49.071
They haven't heard from her
in nearly a year.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.945
Are you looking for her?

34:57.420 --> 34:59.741
Is the most powerful
law enforcement agency

34:59.820 --> 35:01.549
in the world looking for her?

35:01.620 --> 35:03.110
I can't do that.

35:03.940 --> 35:05.021
Oh.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.829
It's against the rules?

35:12.860 --> 35:15.386
We don't know what they will find.

35:16.980 --> 35:17.981
Do we?

36:21.180 --> 36:23.182
Where the hell did they get that?

36:48.380 --> 36:49.506
Mr. Bates.

36:49.580 --> 36:53.027
This Washington Post story says
we know who the Watergate ringleader is.

36:54.020 --> 36:57.866
Then, this morning,
our Time magazine pal, Sandy Smith,

36:57.940 --> 37:01.501
called the acting director
to say that he is prepping a story

37:01.580 --> 37:04.060
that the FBI is plotting a whitewash.

37:04.140 --> 37:08.828
He said the director has put
a 48-hour cap on the investigation.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.870
- What's your point?
- Ls that true?

37:11.300 --> 37:14.065
Someone in this office
is talking to the press.

37:14.140 --> 37:15.505
The point, Mr. Lano,

37:15.580 --> 37:17.548
is that leaks kill investigations.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.782
- Whoa, whoa. Okay.
- Take it down, Angie.

37:19.860 --> 37:23.103
You want to conduct
a leak investigation, be my guest.

37:23.180 --> 37:26.468
But you got 200 field agents from
here to LA all chasing down leads,

37:26.620 --> 37:28.349
so you're gonna have to
ask them all, too.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.149
Tone, in front of Mr. Felt.

37:30.220 --> 37:33.986
I can guarantee it wasn't me
or any of the guys in this room.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.580
Donald H. Segretti.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.227
You pulled that name
from Howard Hunt's phone records.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.064
He called Hunt a few dozen times, yeah.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.747
This says Segretti used to be a lawyer
in the Treasury Department,

37:44.900 --> 37:47.187
paid out of the account
that funded the Watergate.

37:47.300 --> 37:50.543
An account belonging to
the Committee to Re-elect the President.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.583
- Who is the head of the committee?
- John Mitchell.

37:52.660 --> 37:55.470
Former Attorney General, John Mitchell.

37:55.980 --> 37:58.711
The best we can make out is
Segretti's some kind of prankster.

37:58.860 --> 38:02.626
You know, like he's spying on the Dems,
sending their wives dirty pictures.

38:02.700 --> 38:06.022
- It's all bottom-feeder, frat boy stuff.
- Indictable under election laws.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.909
Forget the plot of the story,
Mr. Kunkel.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.142
What's the theme? What's it saying?
What does it mean?

38:10.220 --> 38:13.064
Like Angie, like Mr. Lano said,
we are still vetting the leads.

38:13.140 --> 38:17.031
All the ugly politics,
all the dirty money, all the sleaze.

38:17.140 --> 38:20.144
It means the goddamn punks
are running the country!

38:28.300 --> 38:29.426
Keep going.

38:30.980 --> 38:33.790
You might want to talk to
the White House about those leaks.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.509
- Why?
- 'Cause whenever I'm lucky enough

38:40.580 --> 38:42.628
to get someone over there
to actually talk to me,

38:43.020 --> 38:44.784
they know what I'm gonna ask
before I ask it.

38:47.740 --> 38:49.708
It's like they already know
what I want to know.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.902
Mr. Felt, I have the White House
on the phone. Mr. John Dean.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.026
Put him through.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.906
Mr. Dean.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.466
<i>The White House is concerned
about these press leaks.</i>

39:31.940 --> 39:33.430
Of course.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.743
<i>We think the source
must be someone in the FBI.</i>

39:42.980 --> 39:44.982
Why FBI?

39:45.180 --> 39:47.387
<i>That's where the information is.</i>

39:48.500 --> 39:51.470
Those stories could have come
from someone in the White House.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.181
We want you to do something
about it, Mr. Felt.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.501
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Now.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.345
Fine.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.945
But I don't understand.

40:04.340 --> 40:07.071
- Which part?
- The part about you calling me.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.629
The White House
has no authority over the FBI.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.989
- We can...
- At all, Mr. Dean.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.425
But we can suggest...

40:22.540 --> 40:26.022
I'm afraid the White House
has nothing to suggest to the FBI.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.903
- Thank you, Mr. <i>Felt.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Dean.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.305
I want you to disappear
our investigation on these two names.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.668
Get them off the interview list.

41:07.740 --> 41:09.344
I don't get it. They're nobody.

41:09.460 --> 41:10.871
Just do it.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.901
Then make sure you say you did it
in Monday's memo for the director.

41:26.020 --> 41:27.226
Thank you.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.387
Your daily Watergate briefing.

41:34.740 --> 41:37.789
Thanks, Charlie. May I call you Charlie?

41:39.540 --> 41:42.862
How much of what we are getting
on Watergate am I actually seeing?

41:45.220 --> 41:47.268
Mr. Felt gives me the headlines.
I type them up.

41:47.340 --> 41:49.911
I give Mr. Felt the original
and bring you a copy.

41:51.460 --> 41:54.031
Mr. Felt doesn't want
to waste your time with details.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.501
Okay.

42:03.900 --> 42:05.311
Okay, Mr. Gray.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.305
Mr. Kunkel!

42:20.820 --> 42:23.380
Director Gray wanted you to know
he understands you and your boys

42:23.420 --> 42:24.865
are doing a hell of a job.

42:25.300 --> 42:28.782
Well, thank Mr. Gray, and not to worry.
We'll gather the whole ball of yarn.

42:28.860 --> 42:30.544
Mr. Gray also wanted you to know

42:30.620 --> 42:34.750
that there was gonna be a small change
in procedure in the information flow.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.903
How and, more precisely, where it flows.

42:39.140 --> 42:42.110
Not just the headlines,
but the story itself.

42:42.420 --> 42:44.582
The details, as it were.

42:46.220 --> 42:48.302
Does Mr. Felt know?

42:49.620 --> 42:51.065
Of course.

43:46.300 --> 43:48.507
Angie Lano called me last night.

43:49.820 --> 43:51.470
He told me
that he called the White House

43:51.580 --> 43:53.548
to set up a round of interviews.

43:53.900 --> 43:56.187
Half hour later
the White House called back

43:56.260 --> 43:59.184
to tell me that we can't talk
to two of the guys

43:59.580 --> 44:02.060
because their names
were taken off the list.

44:02.980 --> 44:04.505
The two names you told me.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.862
How would the White House know?

44:08.820 --> 44:10.868
I guess somebody told them.

44:12.220 --> 44:14.985
The only people who knew
were me and you.

44:16.300 --> 44:17.790
And Mr. Gray.

44:19.580 --> 44:21.025
And Mr. Gray.

44:23.860 --> 44:25.988
We need to find out what Gray has,

44:27.300 --> 44:28.984
and how he's getting it.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.062
Did I do something wrong?

44:35.140 --> 44:36.710
Mr. Bates tells me

44:37.740 --> 44:41.506
you've been giving Mr. Gray everything
we're collecting on Watergate.

44:42.420 --> 44:44.707
All our interviews, all of our files.

44:46.860 --> 44:49.591
Did Mr. Gray tell you to bypass me?

44:49.740 --> 44:51.788
Well, he didn't say
it was a secret or anything.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.062
But he said that you knew.

44:58.940 --> 45:01.864
How often did you give him our files?

45:01.940 --> 45:03.624
- Every day.
- Why?

45:05.180 --> 45:07.182
We know why.

45:11.780 --> 45:15.227
Did you give the Attorney General
any information about our investigation?

45:15.300 --> 45:17.780
- I don't talk to the Attorney General.
- Did you, Mr. Bates?

45:19.140 --> 45:20.630
Mr. Miller?

45:26.060 --> 45:28.062
The Attorney General
called me this morning

45:28.220 --> 45:31.588
about something
he could only have heard from the FBI.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.788
He's putting a box around Watergate.

45:42.660 --> 45:45.584
We can't touch anything
before the break-in.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.550
We have to stay away
from all the White House corruption.

45:49.900 --> 45:53.621
In other words,
the crimes that matter don't matter.

45:54.380 --> 45:57.623
For the first time in its history,
the FBI

45:58.780 --> 46:00.782
has been quarantined.

46:00.860 --> 46:04.831
Crimes that it knows about
will go uninvestigated.

46:09.260 --> 46:11.911
- Mr. Felt...
- Thank you, Mr. Kunkel.

46:25.180 --> 46:28.343
So, with everything we have right now,

46:29.940 --> 46:32.022
if we could get indictments,

46:33.860 --> 46:37.342
in your opinion, who would we get?

46:38.420 --> 46:39.751
How high?

46:42.980 --> 46:44.869
Maybe Attorney General.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.105
What about the president?

46:55.060 --> 46:56.869
What about the president?

46:57.620 --> 46:59.907
If the president's lying...

47:01.860 --> 47:03.510
ls the president lying?

47:03.580 --> 47:05.264
They're all lying.

47:07.900 --> 47:09.186
Then, yes.

47:11.980 --> 47:13.345
Maybe the president.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.348
<i>As the investigations went forward,</i>

47:17.420 --> 47:22.187
<i>I repeatedly asked
those conducting the investigation</i>

47:22.580 --> 47:24.901
<i>whether there was any reason to believe</i>

47:24.980 --> 47:29.065
<i>that members of my administration
were in any way involved.</i>

47:29.900 --> 47:34.224
<i>I received repeated assurances
that there were none.</i>

47:34.540 --> 47:36.781
<i>I discounted the stories in the press.</i>

47:36.980 --> 47:39.665
<i>Who do you think gave
the orders to bug the Watergate?</i>

47:39.900 --> 47:43.143
<i>Well,
the persons who the grand jury indicted</i>

47:43.220 --> 47:44.870
<i>in Washington, DC, last week,</i>

47:45.020 --> 47:46.590
<i>gave the orders to do it.</i>

47:46.660 --> 47:48.150
<i>You don't think
they were following orders, then?</i>

47:48.340 --> 47:50.069
<i>- No, I do not.
- There's nobody higher?</i>

47:50.140 --> 47:52.188
<i>There has been no evidence
presented that anybody did that.</i>

47:52.300 --> 47:54.985
<i>I think the opposition is disappointed</i>

47:55.060 --> 47:57.791
<i>that after such a thorough,
intensive investigation</i>

47:57.860 --> 48:00.340
<i>that just seven persons were indicted.</i>

48:00.420 --> 48:02.946
<i>The Watergate break-in
took a dramatic turn</i>

48:03.020 --> 48:04.226
<i>when one of the defendants,</i>

48:04.300 --> 48:06.587
former White House consultant
E. Howard Hunt,

48:06.660 --> 48:07.946
changed his plea to guilty.

48:08.020 --> 48:10.944
<i>The judge accepted
the guilty pleas of the four Miami men</i>

48:11.020 --> 48:13.261
<i>on the condition
that they answer his questions</i>

48:13.340 --> 48:15.627
<i>on who else was involved in Watergate.</i>

48:15.700 --> 48:19.864
<i>With the crucial questions
of who, and what, were behind it all</i>

48:19.940 --> 48:21.066
<i>still unanswered.</i>

48:22.780 --> 48:24.748
<i>I got a call
from across the river.</i>

48:25.820 --> 48:28.505
<i>- Which river is that?
- The Potomac.</i>

48:28.740 --> 48:30.071
The CIA.

48:31.060 --> 48:33.540
The CIA is telling us
we need to taper off.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.349
Taper off?

48:36.180 --> 48:38.786
- We're getting too close.
- Too close to what?

48:38.860 --> 48:40.021
I can't tell you.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.148
You can't, or you won't?

48:42.220 --> 48:44.222
It's a matter of national security.

48:44.380 --> 48:48.704
<i>We are doing everything that
we can to investigate this incident.</i>

48:48.980 --> 48:52.541
<i>No one on the White House staff,
no one in this administration</i>

48:52.620 --> 48:56.341
<i>was involved in this
very bizarre incident.</i>

48:57.060 --> 48:59.631
<i>The CIA is telling us
we need to taper off.</i>

49:00.380 --> 49:02.462
<i>Disappointed. Disappointed.</i>

49:02.540 --> 49:04.588
<i>No one in this administration...</i>

49:04.660 --> 49:07.982
<i>We're getting too close.
It's a matter of national security.</i>

49:11.580 --> 49:14.345
<i>A bomb exploded
early this morning in the Pentagon</i>

49:14.420 --> 49:16.627
<i>and left-wing terrorists
telephoned newspapers</i>

49:16.740 --> 49:18.105
<i>to say they were responsible.</i>

49:19.900 --> 49:21.425
<i>People calling themselves members
of the Weather Underground...</i>

49:21.500 --> 49:22.911
- Yes?
<i>- Are you watching this?</i>

49:22.980 --> 49:24.220
I see it.

49:24.900 --> 49:27.380
- What about the White House?
- It's at the top of their list.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.104
I told you that three months ago.

49:29.180 --> 49:33.788
- But can they really hit it?
- They just hit the Pentagon.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.189
I want us to open files on every member

49:36.300 --> 49:38.951
of every counterculture organization
in the country.

49:39.020 --> 49:41.546
<i>Hunt them to exhaustion.
No holds barred.</i>

49:42.060 --> 49:44.540
The president is fighting
for the White House.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.390
That's not my job.

49:46.620 --> 49:48.065
The president needs order.

49:48.140 --> 49:50.666
I promised the president
he'd have order.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.425
Which brings me
to my next point, Felt.

49:57.900 --> 50:00.221
I spoke to the Attorney General.

50:01.780 --> 50:04.704
The Attorney General
is going to officially announce

50:04.860 --> 50:08.182
we have found nothing
connecting the president on Watergate.

50:08.260 --> 50:10.740
What? But that's not real.

50:10.820 --> 50:15.701
I know. And the president knows
you are still pursuing it.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.308
<i>You're never going to find
what you're chasing.</i>

50:20.380 --> 50:23.031
<i>I want it to end.
It's time to finish it.</i>

50:23.140 --> 50:24.790
<i>Shut it down.</i>

50:27.300 --> 50:30.224
I hear you and your wife
are registered Democrats, Mark.

50:30.860 --> 50:32.942
I hope you're not going
to let that get in the way.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.260
<i>The Weather Underground,
they're combining.</i>

50:40.340 --> 50:42.104
They're multiplying.

50:42.180 --> 50:43.750
We'll never get warrants. Not now.

50:43.820 --> 50:44.821
Warrants?

50:45.140 --> 50:48.110
We're not talking about the kids
sleeping out there in the parks.

50:48.180 --> 50:52.071
We're talking about people who would
burn your children alive in their beds.

50:52.140 --> 50:54.302
People die because we stick
to the letter of the law,

50:54.420 --> 50:56.582
we lose everything, including the law.

50:57.580 --> 50:58.741
We're taking off the gloves.

50:59.460 --> 51:01.827
Entries, taps, nothing on paper.

51:01.900 --> 51:03.709
No warrants.

51:03.780 --> 51:05.623
Mr. Miller's people
report to Mr. Miller.

51:05.700 --> 51:06.861
Mr. Miller reports to me.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.544
Just like the bad old days.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.783
Where's Bill Sullivan when you need him?

51:10.860 --> 51:12.430
He's over at the White House,

51:12.500 --> 51:16.186
protecting the nation by spying
on senators and their mistresses

51:16.420 --> 51:20.061
while we're here just trying to
keep all this goddamn mess together.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.180
Hey, look.

51:29.780 --> 51:31.430
We're on your side here.

51:31.900 --> 51:34.028
All I'm saying is,
all that was behind us.

51:34.260 --> 51:35.910
Even Hoover knew
the dirty stuff was over.

51:35.980 --> 51:37.391
That's why Bill's gone.

51:38.380 --> 51:41.270
All I'm saying is, everyone is watching.

51:41.540 --> 51:44.146
How many more kids do we have to lose?

51:44.260 --> 51:47.230
How many more
do we let just vanish into eternity?

51:47.940 --> 51:49.829
I am not Bill Sullivan.

51:50.620 --> 51:53.066
This is still the goddamn FBI.

52:15.660 --> 52:17.025
I don't want to intrude.

52:18.420 --> 52:19.546
Then don't.

52:24.180 --> 52:25.261
You heard from her?

52:26.860 --> 52:28.146
Joan.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.661
You think she's involved with all this?

52:34.780 --> 52:36.020
The Underground?

52:37.700 --> 52:39.031
How could she?

52:39.740 --> 52:42.027
She's just like me. Exactly like me.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.340
She worships you.

52:49.780 --> 52:50.827
She's okay.

52:52.980 --> 52:54.220
I can feel it, Mark.

52:57.340 --> 52:59.911
There's a price to pay for what we do,
Mr. Miller.

53:00.020 --> 53:02.261
There's a price to pay
for what we become.

53:04.300 --> 53:06.507
We all pay it, one way or another.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.188
<i>Watergate
was the most intensive,</i>

53:11.260 --> 53:14.662
<i>objective and thorough investigation</i>

53:15.060 --> 53:19.702
<i>in the history of the
US Attorney's office and the FBI.</i>

53:20.740 --> 53:23.823
<i>The Justice Department has now completed</i>

53:24.340 --> 53:26.911
<i>its criminal investigation</i>

53:26.980 --> 53:30.063
<i>without implicating any present official</i>

53:30.660 --> 53:32.264
<i>of either the White House</i>

53:32.780 --> 53:35.829
<i>or the Committee
to Re-elect the President.</i>

53:36.140 --> 53:37.426
- Completed?
- Any questions?

53:37.540 --> 53:38.780
What the hell, man?

53:39.300 --> 53:40.665
Get me Felt on the phone.

53:40.740 --> 53:42.504
<i>- As to the White House?
- Hold on, hold on. Wait a second.</i>

53:42.700 --> 53:47.627
<i>I understand the FBi's Watergate
investigation is in a state of repose</i>

53:47.700 --> 53:49.702
<i>and unlikely to be reopened.</i>

53:49.780 --> 53:51.782
Anybody tell us this was over yet?

53:52.380 --> 53:55.190
Get me Felt on the phone! Or Bates!

53:56.500 --> 53:57.865
God damn it, get me Felt!

53:57.980 --> 53:59.345
- She can't.
- Why the hell not?

53:59.420 --> 54:00.945
'Cause he's right there.

54:01.020 --> 54:04.547
<i>And now, let's return to the press
conference of the US Attorney General.</i>

54:51.380 --> 54:52.586
Maybe she's dead.

54:56.700 --> 54:58.350
Maybe she just gave up.

54:59.340 --> 55:01.104
Didn't think anybody cared.

55:04.180 --> 55:06.467
Maybe she's right out there watching us.

55:07.660 --> 55:09.708
To see what a man like you does

55:09.780 --> 55:12.021
when your daughter
just vanishes one night

55:12.100 --> 55:13.590
for no good reason.

55:13.660 --> 55:15.185
Joan had a reason for everything.

55:16.220 --> 55:17.346
You hated her.

55:23.300 --> 55:25.109
Mothers don't hate their daughters.

55:26.860 --> 55:29.101
It's just not always easy being one.

55:29.700 --> 55:31.668
You dressed her up like a doll,

55:32.540 --> 55:34.861
until she got old enough
to look just like you.

55:34.940 --> 55:35.941
Mark.

55:36.020 --> 55:38.671
You kept telling her to get out
until one day she listened to you.

55:38.740 --> 55:40.185
Listen to me.

55:41.340 --> 55:42.751
I had no mother.

55:42.820 --> 55:44.310
But she did.

55:44.380 --> 55:45.586
Yes.

55:46.460 --> 55:47.541
She did.

55:48.500 --> 55:49.911
My father just left.

55:51.780 --> 55:53.782
So, yes, she gave me up

55:54.860 --> 55:56.544
to foster homes,

55:57.060 --> 55:58.789
then the orphanage.

56:01.380 --> 56:03.428
- But you know all about that, don't you?
- Yeah.

56:10.380 --> 56:12.189
Then I made my own way.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.831
Until you.

56:16.860 --> 56:18.225
My White knight.

56:21.220 --> 56:24.269
Our homes are the only homes
I've ever known.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.583
You were both mine.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.301
<i>How's home, Mark?</i>

56:42.900 --> 56:44.106
Why are you asking?

56:44.820 --> 56:46.584
That daughter of yours, Jill?

56:48.380 --> 56:49.381
Joan.

56:50.420 --> 56:51.910
Well, I hear she's terrific.

56:53.140 --> 56:56.144
Fulbright scholar,
first girl in the country.

56:57.940 --> 56:59.510
A chip off the old block.

57:06.220 --> 57:09.702
I want you to be the first
to hear my statement to the press.

57:15.180 --> 57:16.989
"No pressure has been put on me

57:17.820 --> 57:21.188
"or any of my special agents
in the FBI's investigation

57:21.260 --> 57:24.707
"and that it strains..." I thought
I would just nip this in the bud.

57:25.260 --> 57:27.866
"It strains credulity
that President Nixon

57:27.980 --> 57:30.381
"could have done a con job
on the whole American people."

57:32.980 --> 57:34.391
What do you think?

57:37.220 --> 57:38.745
It's just fine.

57:43.740 --> 57:46.505
<i>The Democrats
have issued a statement this morning.</i>

57:48.220 --> 57:52.111
<i>"The FBI's Watergate investigation
is a whitewash.</i>

57:54.700 --> 57:58.944
"What is involved here is not only
the political life of this nation

57:59.900 --> 58:03.871
"but the very morality of our leaders

58:05.140 --> 58:08.781
"at a time when the United States
desperately needs to revitalize

58:08.860 --> 58:11.067
"its moral standards."

58:13.940 --> 58:17.387
"The FBI's Watergate investigation

58:19.900 --> 58:21.345
"is a whitewash."

58:25.700 --> 58:26.986
That's it.

58:33.300 --> 58:34.984
Well, gentlemen.

58:35.060 --> 58:36.585
Here's what we know.

58:37.820 --> 58:40.346
We know what we've heard
out of the Department of Justice

58:40.420 --> 58:42.309
the past two days is bullshit.

58:44.780 --> 58:47.829
We know the men
who broke into the Watergate

58:47.900 --> 58:49.584
are not the end of this thing,

58:51.260 --> 58:52.705
but the beginning.

58:53.660 --> 58:55.389
We know this is the latest link

58:55.460 --> 59:00.500
in a chain of illegal,
covert intelligence operations

59:00.900 --> 59:02.948
by the president's re-election campaign.

59:04.060 --> 59:07.382
We know we are facing obstruction
from multiple fronts.

59:07.460 --> 59:08.871
From the White House.

59:09.260 --> 59:10.750
From the CIA.

59:11.860 --> 59:14.466
From the Attorney General
of the United States,

59:14.540 --> 59:17.225
who is our boss, by the way.

59:18.420 --> 59:21.867
It is not our job to speculate
on the involvement of the president.

59:24.340 --> 59:26.707
It is our job
to follow the bread crumbs.

59:27.940 --> 59:31.387
But those bread crumbs
appear to be taking us

59:31.460 --> 59:33.986
on a tour of the West Wing
of the White House,

59:35.900 --> 59:38.665
and in the general direction
of the Oval Office.

59:40.380 --> 59:44.988
We also know we've been ordered
to shut down our pursuit of all this

59:45.060 --> 59:46.505
as of today.

59:48.060 --> 59:50.950
And we know that except
for the 30 men in this room,

59:52.620 --> 59:56.067
no one in the entire country
knows any of this

59:56.140 --> 59:58.666
and may never know any of this.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.347
No one can stop the driving force
of an FBI investigation.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.022
Not even the FBI.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.186
Segretti.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.944
I'm going to give you the name of a man

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.421
who was asked to work
for the Nixon administration

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.830
in an unusual way.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.820
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.989
There's only one way to understand
what Watergate really means,

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.266
and this is it.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.387
The name

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.068
is Alex Shipley.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.187
Shipley.-

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.183
He lives in Nashville.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.901
The man who approached him
was a lawyer out of LA

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.470
named Donald Segretti.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.981
Segretti.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.421
Shipley can tell you everything
you need to know.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.391
<i>Will Shipley talk?</i>

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.226
I guess you're going
to have to find that out.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.907
One more thing.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.505
This comes from classified FBI files.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.830
The Department of Justice has it,
the White House has it,

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.625
and, now, you have it.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.901
<i>Let's just get on
with the election and stop this nonsense</i>

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.227
<i>about there having been
a political espionage campaign</i>

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.301
<i>against the Democrats.</i>

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.860
<i>Here's what's making
the news at the top of the hour.</i>

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.070
<i>North Vietnamese military attempts
to break through South Vietnamese lines</i>

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.940
<i>have been met with an intense
bombing attack by a US aircraft.</i>

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.581
<i>General Creighton Abrams,
the United States commander in Vietnam,</i>

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.742
ordered every available B-52

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.663
<i>into the northern sector
of South Vietnam.</i>

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.549
<i>Though baseball season is over,</i>

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.022
<i>the Philadelphia Phils went to
the Ozarks for a new manager today.</i>

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.183
<i>Los Angeles coach Danny Ozark
was the surprise choice</i>

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.985
<i>of Phils' general manager, Paul Owens.</i>

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.303
Ozark <i>has had no big league
managerial experience...</i>

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.820
Mr. Woodward.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.785
The story isn't moving.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.789
Everyone stopped listening to you.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.504
This isn't the same as before.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.191
We're lost in detail.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.304
That's their plan.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.826
They want everyone confused.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.543
Confusion is control.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.784
The truth could ruin the administration.

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.907
How high?

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.351
How high does it go?

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.581
You still don't understand
what I'm giving you.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.790
This is dangerous stuff
you're playing with.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.825
Especially, if it's known
before November 7th.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.189
That's election day.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.150
You put out the right story,
the public will scream.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.747
The Attorney General
will have to let me keep going.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.625
My editors know
that I'm talking to somebody,

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.980
but not who.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.300
They don't ask.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.749
No one understands
how one person knows so much.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.221
No one can possibly know
how much I know.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.430
With all this mystery,

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.907
there's a nickname for you at the paper.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.702
- Deep Throat.
- What?

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.108
They didn't know what else to call you.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.227
That's just...

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.102
They shouldn't have to call me anything.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.307
Take out your notebook. There's more.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.184
<i>"FBI agents have established
Watergate bugging incident,</i>

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.907
"massive campaign
of political spying and sabotage.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.260
<i>"'There is some
very powerful information, '</i>

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.064
<i>"said one federal official,</i>

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:31.505
<i>“especially if it's known

<i>The White House

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.387
<i>a pack of scurrilous lies and innuendo.</i>

He's here, Mark. He has to be.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.989
There's a spy in the FBI.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.422
"FBI agents have established..."

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.423
"One federal investigative
official said..."

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.343
"According to FBI reports..."

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.910
That's us, God damn it.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.868
There is information in here
that the bureau only got 72 hours ago.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.983
Are you goddamn joking?

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.470
Mr. Felt,
you had something you wanted to say.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.707
The last few days,
I've heard various people

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.260
accuse Mr. Lano of leaking to the press.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.830
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Him?

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.067
And that he
and certain newspaper reporters

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.500
- have been seen together.
- I'm going to be sick.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.384
I wanted to say to you, Mr. Lano,
in front of everyone here

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.984
that I know these are
vicious lies by jealous agents.

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.307
You're doing a fine job,
and no matter what,

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.905
the director and I will support you.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.111
Mr. Gray.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.784
I may not be an FBI lifer
like some of you.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.623
I'm certainly no Mark Felt.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.343
Since I arrived here,
I have put up with paranoia,

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.107
insubordination, second-guessing.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.148
Gentlemen, it's come to Jesus time.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.901
Whoever the leaker is,
whoever is the Judas among you,

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:16.587
betraying me,
the other good men in this room,

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.229
his family, God,

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.429
not to mention the bureau
and the legacy of J. Edgar Hoover,

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.546
step forward.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.504
Right here, right now.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:56.265
Charlie, we got an office pool
on who the leak is.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.788
My money's on you.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.620
It's just one big game, Charlie.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.826
We're all just chess pieces.
You gotta remember that.

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.069
What's the body count?

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.790
Eight, so far.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.662
You, me, a few guys on my team.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.751
- Where are they sending you?
- St. Louis.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:46.988
But I don't know
how much more I have left in me.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.741
<i>You'?</i>

01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:52.020
San Francisco.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.471
Well, at least, it's Frisco.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.387
Yeah.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.747
Great.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.862
How many years you put in here, Charlie?

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.147
The whole run.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.945
My kids were born here.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.227
<i>Whatever Watergate was,
whatever it wasn't,</i>

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.304
<i>the American people don't seem
to understand, nor care,</i>

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.384
<i>as Nixon has won in a landslide.</i>

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.027
I appreciate you taking the time,
Mr. Felt.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.869
I always take care of my people,
Mr. Bates.

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.860
In fact, my father always said to me,

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:57.262
"Mark, whatever we do,
we have to make our lives vectors."

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:01.949
Lines with force and direction.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:12.031
You have to destroy anything
that is sick beyond repair

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.149
to rescue it from its agony.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.301
Mark.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.461
And...

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:23.225
And the agony it causes everyone else,
Mr. Bates.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.109
<i>It was thought that he might
have a little bit of difficulty.</i>

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.827
- Mr. Felt.
- What are you doing, Charlie?

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.462
What is it, Mr. Bates?

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.981
Here's to you. Bravo.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.987
Genesis commune.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.869
Ben Lomond, California.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.626
Check it thoroughly.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.464
These leaks
are driving the White House crazy.

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.983
The White House
thinks it knows who it is.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.231
Your name came up.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:15.508
Do you have any idea
what that would mean?

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.385
Treason, for one.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.104
Betrayal of everything
the FBI stands for, for another.

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.944
Everything you stand for.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.464
So, why would I do it?

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.301
I don't know.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.628
I can't imagine their thinking.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.783
Why don't they fire me then?

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.911
You know everything.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.990
To them, the only thing worse
than keeping you is firing you.

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.109
Dean did say something strange.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.384
Apparently, they know everything
going on inside our shop.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.029
- They have a source.
- Inside the FBI?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:01.825
He said they hear everything.

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.141
We just swept your office for bugs,
Mr. Felt.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.631
Do it again!

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.746
The knives are out.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.111
More than you know.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.426
<i>Am I safe?</i>

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.107
No One is.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.349
The White House
is gonna sanitize the entire town.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.107
<i>The director of Central Intelligence
will be gone by morning.</i>

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.306
<i>Why?</i>

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.702
Apparently, he couldn't
smoke you out fast enough.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.386
The source

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.390
of all those stories.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.590
Where does the CIA stand?

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.022
<i>The CIA is building a wall.</i>

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.506
<i>We'll stay out of your way,</i>

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.503
but if we're forced
to protect ourselves,

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:22.981
we will.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.422
<i>The FBI will
never reach the CIA on this.</i>

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.786
And the White House?

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.151
Presidents come and go,

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.750
but the CIA stays.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.745
The FBI stays.

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.470
We are the constants.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.466
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.461
Time magazine's person of the year
is going to be Richard Nixon.

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.906
I thought you'd like to know.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.027
Happy holidays.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.385
The president told me
the unthinkable has happened.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.069
He actually misses Hoover.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.462
"Hoover would have gotten
the dogs off him," he said.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.342
"He'd have everyone scared to death."

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.783
The White House is going
to make me director permanently.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.106
Congratulations.

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.868
Bill Sullivan
will be my number two.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.909
You know what the president
said to me today?

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.866
He said, "The Germans had the right idea
during World War ll.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:32.151
"If they went through a town and one
of their soldiers got hit by a sniper,

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.588
"they'd line up the whole goddamn town
and kill everyone."

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.265
He said,
"It's time to clean out the FBI."

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.748
You know what that will mean for me.

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.424
Remember, they're afraid of you.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.069
Mark, if you did know something,
you could come to me.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.260
We'd be able to work it out together.
We could do something about it.

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.349
I can't protect you anymore.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.065
Just give 'em what they want.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.663
The traitor's head on a platter.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.582
So, the president asked me
what he should do.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:11.381
And, I tell him, get rid of everyone
in the interest of the nation.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.584
I didn't mean me, of course.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.503
You don't have many friends left,
you know.

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.748
A bunch of your FBI pals
told me to cut your nuts off.

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.422
Think they'll let you keep your badge?

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.343
You got a lot of people worried
in Washington.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.540
They think
you're gonna unwrap everything.

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.750
Everything from all the years.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:42.788
Everything we, you and I, know.

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.630
Is that what you want to know, Bill?

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.746
This your last little errand?

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.544
To help the president sleep at night.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.742
I'm just sayin', you open those scabs,

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.865
a lot of things underneath.

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.710
Just remember, no one likes informers.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.583
They only remember you as a rat,

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.222
even if you were their...
Even if you were their rat!

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:19.981
Mr. Felt, Mr. Miller's on the phone.
He needs to speak with you.

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.500
- This is Special Agent Clark.
- I don't want to know his name.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.384
Tell him what you told Mr. Bates and me.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.420
I don't think you have anything
to worry about, Mr. Felt.

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.345
You don't think.

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.501
Specific.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.544
The commune where the subject,
Joan Felt...

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.025
Do not say her name.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.187
Where the target is...

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.023
Definitely some people
of interest in there.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:15.301
- Maybe some with the Underground.
- But the target?

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.025
If you ask me,

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.468
just someone's kid
looking for a way home.

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.062
We never spoke. No paper.

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.301
You don't know anything.

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.149
Do you know your physics, Sandy?

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.945
If you tap repeatedly

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:17.704
on the post of a building,
and the tapping is relentless,

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.460
it creates a rhythm.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.347
If you do that long enough
and steadily enough, it will feed back.

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.548
The frequencies will align,

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.588
the molecules will scramble,

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.541
and the whole thing, the whole building
will come apart from the inside

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.264
and collapse in on itself,

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.428
and all come tumbling down.

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.942
The molecules are beginning to scramble.

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:46.069
The FBI is coming apart.
Do you know where that takes us?

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:49.543
Do you want a country
this big, this angry, this confused

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.224
without a police department?

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.871
Get out your notebook.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.951
May, 1969 and February, 1971.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.706
Mark, are you sure about this?

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.869
Between those dates,
White House employees were wiretapped.

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.784
Many of them aides
to the Secretary of State

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.705
and five reporters,
including The New York Times.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.511
You're kidding.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.551
- This is hard for you.
- What part?

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.664
All this truth.

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.985
The truth is hard for you.

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:46.704
The FBI illegally,
unconstitutionally and reprehensibly

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.226
bugged and taped

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.667
and secretly photographed
and memorialized

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.902
every move that those people made.

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:58.142
Them and their wives and
their mistresses and homosexual lovers.

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.263
- Who did the wiretaps?
- Bill Sullivan.

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.861
It became a rogue FBI operation.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.464
Sullivan drove it. Sullivan and
the White House by themselves.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.786
How 'bout you?

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.980
What do you know?

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.702
About everything else,
I knew every sordid little detail.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.111
But not this.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.620
They knew
they couldn't tell me about this.

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.945
Yeah, they couldn't count on you.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.824
The White House is packing
all its crimes in separate little boxes.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:36.222
Watergate, the spying,
the ugliness, the rot.

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.670
Each thing in a different box,
so that no one can put it together,

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.027
so that no one sees it's all connected.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.900
And no one will care.
But it's all the same big thing.

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.589
And Watergate? Just the gateway.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.271
Can you get the story out
before Gray's confirmation hearing?

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.065
What you're doing

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:08.106
will bring down
the whole house of cards.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:13.226
But then, you already knew that.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.829
<i>Gray is ready to fall now.</i>

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.910
<i>Watch where it leads.</i>

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.903
Any last-minute advice?

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.585
We've gone over everything.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.384
They'll go easy-

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.102
You're the president's man.

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.981
Mr. Gray. What about this?

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.788
I don't know what my position should be.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.064
It was before your time.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.305
Tell the truth.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.190
No one can argue with the truth.

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.784
Mr. Gray, this Time magazine
article by Sandy Smith

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.751
contains information on alleged wiretaps
requested by the White House

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:17.584
installed by the FBI.

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.185
How do you respond to these charges?

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.144
It was before my time, Senator.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.711
What about the assertion in this article

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.183
that a White House aide
slipped Donald Segretti,

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:34.104
a target of the bureau's
Watergate investigation,

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.103
copies of what the FBI had?

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.031
We didn't look into that.

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.421
- Why on Earth not?
- I'll have to look into that.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.430
Did you know that the White
House had your confidential file?

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.064
I did. Yes, Senator.

01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:58.549
Let me tell you
how that might have happened.

01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.826
Please do.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.426
White House counsel
John Dean told me

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.425
the White House wanted everything
the FBI had on Watergate

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.582
to help with its own investigation.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.781
Mr. Dean took all those FBI files.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:14.631
How many Bureau reports
are we talking about?

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.909
How many reports did you give Mr. Dean?

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.464
I believe it was 82.

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.709
As the acting director of the FBI,
why on Earth would you do that?

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:28.101
- Because I was told to.
- By who?

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:29.830
Who would have ordered that?

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.307
The president.

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.063
<i>One of the most difficult
decisions of my presidency,</i>

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.710
<i>I accepted the resignations</i>

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.102
<i>of two of my closest associates
in the White House,</i>

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.831
<i>Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.</i>

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:57.701
<i>The counsel to the president,
John Dean, has also resigned.</i>

01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:00.381
<i>The nation tonight
is in the midst of what may be</i>

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.101
<i>the most critical constitutional crisis
in its history.</i>

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.583
<i>As a result of the president's action,
the Attorney General has resigned.</i>

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:13.142
<i>L. Patrick Gray,
head of the FBI for nearly a year,</i>

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.185
<i>will now never take the chair
occupied by J. Edgar Hoover.</i>

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.228
<i>John Dean told me,
during a conversation,</i>

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:21.428
<i>that the White House
masterminded a cover-up.</i>

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.020
<i>I began by telling the president</i>

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.347
<i>that there was a cancer growing
on the presidency,</i>

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.469
<i>that it was important this cancer
be removed immediately</i>

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.020
<i>because it was growing
more deadly every day.</i>

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:42.031
I found Joan.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.745
Let's go get her.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.711
Oh, my God. It's my parents.

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.788
It's all right. I know.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.745
Mark?

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:37.751
Dad.

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.145
This is your grandson.

01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.269
Come here, sweetheart.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.901
There we go.

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:17.624
I had this feeling when I was little,

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.184
that I couldn't see into his eyes,

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.185
that he didn't approve of me.

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.269
That he was holding me up
to some impossible standard.

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:44.020
That was me.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.864
When you were sick and you were little,

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.068
it was your father
who climbed into bed with you

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.545
in his shoes,

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.230
his holster, his suit.

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:05.145
He'd sit with you for hours
and rock you till you fell back asleep.

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:01.981
Oh!
Look at that big baby.

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.907
Thank you.

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:19.426
- Mr. Director? We're ready.
- Mr. Felt.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.784
- Mark.
- Mr. Ruckelshaus.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.106
Thank you.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.343
Mr. Felt, thank you
for 31 years of service

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.229
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.470
- Thank you.
- Hear, hear!

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.700
Congratulations.

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.582
- Hey, congratulations.
- Good luck, Mark.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:29.906
Well done, Mark.

01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.306
Congratulations, sir.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.701
<i>I have never been</i> a <i>quitter.</i>

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.906
To leave office
before my term is completed

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.711
is abhorrent to
every instinct in my body.

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.345
<i>But as president,</i>

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.829
<i>I must put
the interests of America first.</i>

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:57.747
<i>Therefore,</i>

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:02.507
I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:07.545
<i>Vice President Ford,
will be sworn in as president</i>

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.545
<i>at that hour, in this office.</i>

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.628
Counterespionage expert.

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:23.861
Nazi hunter.

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.066
You, Mr. Felt, are the G-man's G-man,

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.226
a hero and a patriot,

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.183
and we are a grateful nation.

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.469
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the past few weeks

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.470
you've heard through testimony
the sounds of the bombs

01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.942
of the PLO and the Weather Underground
ringing in your ears.

01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.670
People died.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.391
We were a nation at war
at home and abroad.

01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.585
We don't dispute that.

01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:54.350
Now, we ask you to listen
for the sound of the Constitution.

01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.827
You hear that?

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.460
It doesn't make quite as much noise
as a bomb, does it?

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.910
It just sits there, silent,
like our conscience,

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:09.701
just as it's done
for the last 200 years.

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:11.660
Mr. Felt.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.069
On September 8th, 1972,

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.185
did you order 143 FBI agents
across the country

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.785
to break into the homes of relatives

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.828
of alleged members
of the Weather Underground,

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.823
to wiretap their phones
and bug their homes?

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.590
- Yes.
- Who else?

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.947
Who else what?

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:30.068
Who else participated
in giving those orders?

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:36.230
- Assistant Director Edward Miller?
- I gave the order.

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.906
Acting Director
L. Patrick Gray the third?

01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:40.584
<i>I gave the order.</i>

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.061
Charles Bates?

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.224
You're really gonna
sit there and do that?

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.631
You're really gonna take that on
for everybody?

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.071
I gave the order.

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.546
Mr. Felt, you stated that you

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.021
frequently briefed
the Nixon White House on the case.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:06.310
Maybe you could just give us
a quick snapshot on how that all worked.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.863
I was in constant contact
with the White House on many matters.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:17.225
In fact, I was in the
Oval Office so often,

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:21.269
people used to say
I had to be Deep Throat.

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.784
What did you just say?

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:34.469
I said I was with the White House,
Dean and so forth, so often,

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.750
people thought I was The Washington
<i>Post's</i> source for Watergate.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.108
The person they called, "Deep Throat."

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.424
Before the witness is excused,

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.910
are there any questions from the jury?

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.389
Well, were you?

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:05.226
- Was I what?
- Were you Deep Throat?
