05:47.114 --> 05:49.481
I'm keeping you alive,

05:49.483 --> 05:52.551
And watch out
for that rat poison.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.619
Oh, I guess you'd
just call it poison.

he probably just
calls it poison.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.190
No.

Besides,

not to call exterminator,"

09:59.399 --> 10:01.066
You are choosing
the road over... (sighs)

10:01.068 --> 10:03.368
Forget it.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.703
Kids, we're going home.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.441
Get on.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.109
(Cleveland Jr. giggles)

10:11.111 --> 10:13.578
(bell jingles)

10:13.580 --> 10:14.946
MAN: Look, they
must be shooting

10:14.948 --> 10:16.815
a commercial
for black gum.

10:19.752 --> 10:24.122
<i>♪ Round and round,</i>
<i>love will hmm, hmm, hmm</i>

10:24.124 --> 10:25.757
<i>♪ Just hmm, hmm, hmm</i>

10:25.759 --> 10:26.257
DONNA:
Cleveland.
Hmm?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.627
Ooh, what reeks?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.729
Donna! You're home
unannounced.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.265
Well, time to leave,
announced.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.067
Donna leaving!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.603
Cleveland, is someone
in the bedroom?

10:38.605 --> 10:39.904
What? No, that's...

10:39.906 --> 10:41.039
You think I'd...

10:42.108 --> 10:43.241
Oh...

10:43.243 --> 10:45.677
Donna I can't keep
living a lie.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.412
There is someone in there.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.848
Someone I care
about very much.

10:49.850 --> 10:54.352
Oh, man. Oh, God.
Oh, man. Oh, God.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.587
But when you
two meet,

10:55.589 --> 10:58.156
I think you'll
love him, too.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.491
Him?!

10:59.493 --> 11:00.992
I knew it.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.827
Everyone knew it.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.996
Starting at tailback,
wearing number fur,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.866
from Mississqueaky
State-- trust me,

11:07.868 --> 11:10.435
you'll get these
when you see him--

11:10.437 --> 11:12.170
cheese welcome...

11:12.172 --> 11:14.506
Rat Lauer!

11:15.641 --> 11:16.841
(screams)

11:16.843 --> 11:18.476
The rat's on my pillow?

11:18.478 --> 11:21.212
Get that disgusting thing
out of this house.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.381
(gasps) I married
a "ratsist."

11:23.383 --> 11:24.549
(screams)

11:24.551 --> 11:26.017
Like the anchor
of the same name,

11:26.019 --> 11:28.453
he's gonna poop
on your shoulder!

11:32.358 --> 11:36.227
Cleveland, call 911.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.699
Operator,
my pet rat's been assaulted.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.567
Yes, I do know.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.636
It was Donna Tubbs.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.804
And she's got
pot upstairs.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.713
That monster
broke the skin.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.148
Now,
Donna-- and I am in no way

11:57.150 --> 11:59.751
defending Mr. Lauer's
deplorable actions here,

11:59.753 --> 12:03.988
but you were
coming at him with
an extremely negative energy.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.890
I was coming at...

12:05.892 --> 12:07.225
(yells)

12:07.227 --> 12:09.027
Now, you listen here.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.861
You done stepped
in it, now.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.997
You been lying
to Donna Tubbs.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.432
I'm sorry!

12:14.434 --> 12:15.266
Now, drive me
to the hospital

12:15.268 --> 12:15.967
before I drop
dead of rabies.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.238
(whistles)

12:20.240 --> 12:21.639
Rat Lauer,
want to go for a ride?

12:23.275 --> 12:25.910
Maybe we'll find
a loose-skinned frog

12:25.912 --> 12:28.446
and call him Al Croaker.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.750
And, as for the rabies,
we'll find a Katie Cure-ic.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.718
(laughs, sighs)

12:33.720 --> 12:35.787
Don't nobody want to get
their news from a woman.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.091
(quietly):
Nice ones.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.693
I know!

12:41.695 --> 12:43.728
Well, Donna,
the good news is

12:43.730 --> 12:46.197
it's extremely uncommon
for rats to carry rabies.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.099
Oh, thank the Lord.

12:48.101 --> 12:48.967
Let me finish.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.635
But not that
uncommon.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.970
You ready,
big fella?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.973
Once I cut off his head
and remove his brain,

12:54.975 --> 12:56.975
we'll send it to the lab
and have
results within a week.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The hell!

12:59.546 --> 13:01.045
Nobody said nothing
about cutting heads.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.914
(chuckles)

13:02.916 --> 13:05.049
Cleveland,
that's the only
way to find out.

13:05.051 --> 13:08.119
Dr. Fist, may I rip
the rat's head off

13:08.121 --> 13:09.587
with my bare hands and
scoop his brains out

13:09.589 --> 13:11.823
with a press-on nail
while my husband watches?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.291
Sure. Why not?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.559
He is a living being.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.395
Donna, how bad
could the month-long series

13:17.397 --> 13:20.165
of extremely painful
stomach injections be?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.800
I can think
of something else

13:21.802 --> 13:24.068
you thought
would be "too painful"

13:24.070 --> 13:25.670
that I talked you into,
which we immediately stopped

13:25.672 --> 13:27.138
because it
was too painful.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.140
Or, if you drill a
hole in his head,

13:29.142 --> 13:32.177
I'll suck his brains
out with a straw.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.778
Okay, okay, okay.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.146
If we took our chances

13:35.148 --> 13:37.982
and Donna did not
get vaccinated,

13:37.984 --> 13:39.684
but she did have rabies...

13:39.686 --> 13:41.152
Certain death
within days.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.821
(inhales through teeth)

13:42.823 --> 13:45.590
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.325
Like to chew on...

13:47.327 --> 13:49.360
Doctor,
I thank you for your time.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.831
My wife and I want to consider
all options before...

13:52.833 --> 13:53.998
I'll do it.
I'll kill him.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.035
But let me take him
into the woods

13:57.037 --> 14:00.171
so his last breath
isn't this
putrid hospital air.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.207
Please, Donna,
I couldn't have a pet

14:02.209 --> 14:04.342
as a child,
and that justifies

14:04.344 --> 14:06.344
(crying):
everything...

14:08.814 --> 14:11.149
Mmm, mmm.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.050
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.689
(gulps)
Hop in, Rat Lauer.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.491
I don't want you to see
where we're going.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.694
It's a surprise.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.496
A terrible, terrible surprise.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.098
(weeping)

14:29.702 --> 14:32.203
(Cleveland Jr. humming)

14:32.205 --> 14:33.571
Hmm, that's new.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.040
Hey, Dad?

14:36.042 --> 14:36.574
Oh, well.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.977
(humming)

14:47.219 --> 14:49.587
Where could he...? No.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.025
(both screaming)

14:54.027 --> 14:56.694
What's in the briefcase?
Rallo, stop.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.429
What's in the briefcase?
At least let me put
some clothes on.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.765
What's in the briefcase?!
Don't "Borat" me, bro!

15:00.767 --> 15:02.066
(both groaning)

15:04.570 --> 15:06.738
Oh, my God.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.972
The briefcase.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.041
Rallo, no!

15:10.043 --> 15:13.778
Two-for-one
corned beef sandwiches

15:13.780 --> 15:16.681
at the Stubby Pickle Deli?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.249
That's what all
this was about?

15:18.251 --> 15:18.883
Well, I guess
you know now.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.218
So give that back.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.587
Nah-uh. Gonna go get
my corned beef on.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.356
What is corned beef?

15:25.358 --> 15:26.958
Guess I'm gonna find out.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.629
All right, pull over,

15:31.631 --> 15:33.765
and let's whack
this mole, damn it.

15:46.245 --> 15:50.648
Rat Lauer,
I awakened every morning

15:50.650 --> 15:54.652
to your incessant squeaking
on mostly girl issues,

15:54.654 --> 15:58.890
(sobbing): and no one but me
ever took you seriously.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.092
You know I just got
to look this little guy

16:01.094 --> 16:03.328
in the eyes one last time
before I do...

16:03.330 --> 16:05.063
(screaming)

16:05.065 --> 16:06.631
Aah, rabbis!
He's got the rabbis!

16:06.633 --> 16:09.133
Kill the son of a bitch!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.835
(screams)
Ow!

16:10.837 --> 16:12.170
Why would
you do that?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.438
I'm not
thinking clearly.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.073
I have rabies.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.112
(screaming)

16:21.114 --> 16:22.480
Get in the car.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.048
(rat screeching)

16:30.089 --> 16:31.155
(panting and whimpering)

16:34.960 --> 16:38.296
Donna,
get my keys.
No.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.031
Well, I've tried
everything.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.503
I would like
to redeem this coupon.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.172
And, what is the most soup
you can give a person?

16:51.777 --> 16:54.412
(loud buzzing)

16:59.618 --> 17:00.718
Welcome back,
Number 14.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.821
Thank you, Number 53.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.990
You see, Rallo,
I'm an operative

17:05.992 --> 17:07.992
for a faction
of ex-CIA officials

17:07.994 --> 17:11.129
deemed too extreme
by the Agency.

17:11.131 --> 17:11.896
Four years ago,
I was recruited

17:11.898 --> 17:13.898
and trained
for operations.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.433
Thank you, Morgana.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.637
A local idiot
named Cleveland Brown

17:19.639 --> 17:22.106
was selected to unwittingly
play the role of my father.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.376
Of course, his actual son,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.979
the real Cleveland Jr.,
had to be eliminated.

17:27.981 --> 17:31.449
I'm Tiger Woods.
I'm Tiger Woods.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.886
Why? What is
this all about?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.421
There's a group
of people, Rallo,

17:36.423 --> 17:38.222
who want to see the
American way of life toppled.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.858
They're based
in Stoolbend because of

17:40.860 --> 17:43.161
proximity to Washington
and good schools.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.328
It's just
a great place to live.

17:44.330 --> 17:49.033
And I've been taking them down
one by one.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.768
This is my next target.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.036
Tim the Bear?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.838
That's not
his real name.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.839
His real name
is Tim the Terrorist.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.842
He's a killing machine.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.277
And you're going to kill him?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.112
No, Rallo, you are.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.515
This contains
a subdermic explosive

18:04.517 --> 18:06.884
capable of blowing you
to smithereens.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.621
Which I can detonate
by this cell
phone at any time.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.791
No, no! Mama!

18:15.394 --> 18:17.862
If I can ever get
any damn reception.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.901
BOTH:
One, two, three, shoot.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.137
Ah, should've used
stronger scissors.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.106
All right.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.440
(sighs)

18:31.610 --> 18:33.444
Scary! Rat! No bite!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.646
(whimpering)

18:36.782 --> 18:38.282
(sighs)

18:38.284 --> 18:41.385
Ha-ha! No sign
of Mighty Mouse.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.621
(laughs)
You should've seen yourself.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.089
You were all...

18:45.091 --> 18:47.658
(mock whimpering)

18:47.660 --> 18:49.093
(laughing)

18:49.095 --> 18:52.296
(screaming)

18:52.298 --> 18:54.132
He's chewing
through the tires.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.008
Donna, this is
all my fault.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.510
I'm a terrible
husband.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.978
Forgive me.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.913
You mean
for giving me rabies?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.149
I didn't bite you.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.521
Is he gone?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.289
I think so.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.826
Then again, we thought so
a number of times now.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.463
(rattling)

19:25.465 --> 19:27.331
He's crawling through
the exhaust pipe.

19:27.333 --> 19:27.865
He's in the car!

19:27.867 --> 19:29.700
(screeches)

19:29.702 --> 19:31.769
(screaming)

19:32.704 --> 19:35.907
(screaming)

19:41.513 --> 19:43.481
(gunshot)

19:43.483 --> 19:45.216
(gasping)

19:46.685 --> 19:47.985
Hell got a rat problem now.

19:47.987 --> 19:52.323
Mama, you didn't leave.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.891
I couldn't.

19:53.893 --> 19:54.992
Not after
getting to know you.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.394
So I went by the house,

19:56.396 --> 19:58.029
and Roberta told me
where you were

19:58.031 --> 19:59.797
and where you
keep your gun.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.632
That's why I
let them know.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.401
Donna, I was tempted,
but I swear,

20:03.403 --> 20:07.138
I'll never choose
the road over you again.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.840
Especially now that I
ain't got to do jack,

20:09.842 --> 20:11.909
with my ol' whipped
son-in-law around.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.146
Where in
the world is Rat Lauer?
He dead.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.048
(laughing)

20:17.050 --> 20:19.350
Yep, she infected.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.719
(all laughing)

20:21.721 --> 20:23.387
Please tell me we
got it that time,

20:23.389 --> 20:24.555
Lego Martin
Scorsese.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.792
Dang, back to one.
