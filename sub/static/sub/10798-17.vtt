Captain's log, stardate 42779.1 .

00:06.256 --> 00:08.257
We're en route
to the Epsilon lX sector

00:08.425 --> 00:11.844
for an astronomical survey
of a new pulsar cluster.

00:12.053 --> 00:16.807
ln the meantime, Ensign Crusher
will be diverting to Starbase 51 5

00:17.017 --> 00:18.559
for Starfleet exams.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.228
This just came in for you
from Starfleet.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.479
Testing parameters?

00:22.689 --> 00:24.148
Do not be apprehensive, Wes.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.484
l found the Academy examinations
quite elementary.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.570
- You would.
- Your earlier test results

00:29.738 --> 00:31.655
were good enough
to get you credit for your work.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.657
l don't think you have anything
to worry about.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.868
Those Academy cadets
can be extremely competitive.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.953
But you have the practical experience,
Wes.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.872

Commander Riker is correct.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.458
While the information imparted
to cadets at the Academy

00:42.625 --> 00:45.919
is unquestionably vital
for prospective Starfleet officers,

00:46.129 --> 00:48.338
it, nonetheless,
requires a significant period

00:48.548 --> 00:51.800
of supplementary systems training
and situational disciplines.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.343
Didn't l just say that?

00:53.553 --> 00:56.430
Yes, sir.
But not quite as perspicuously.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.852
l will not have you telling me
what course to set.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.313
As chief medical officer,
l am ordering you

01:04.522 --> 01:07.107
to report to Starbase 51 5
immediately.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.359
Oh, please. l feel fine.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.696
The truth is,
you have ignored this far too long.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.241
This ship has a mission to carry out.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.243
An astronomical survey
to be conducted

01:18.411 --> 01:20.579
by the science officers, l believe.

01:20.789 --> 01:21.830
And l was looking forward

01:21.998 --> 01:25.459
to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster
for myself.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.504
Then we'll perform the procedure
right here.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.839
Absolutely not.

01:31.382 --> 01:35.052
My staff and l are fully capable
of giving you the replacement.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.305
That's not the point. lt would be--

01:39.766 --> 01:42.976
lt would be inappropriate for you
to carry out the procedure.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.856
Captain Picard, l had no idea.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.984
You do have an ego, don't you?

01:51.194 --> 01:52.444
Meaning?

01:53.029 --> 01:55.280
You're concerned about your image.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.616
Don't worry.

lf you get yourself down
to Starbase 51 5,

02:00.745 --> 02:03.080

Good. l have business there.

Hardly, Number One.

But you'll miss
the Epsilon Pulsar survey.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.913

to Starbase 51 5 is rather unexpected.

Ensign Crusher and l
will rendezvous with you

03:06.644 --> 03:08.562
on your return
from the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster.

03:08.771 --> 03:12.316
Forgive my saying so, sir,
but you're being rather enigmatic.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.026
Consider it captain's privilege.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.070
As first officer,
l have complete security clearance.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.573
This has nothing to do
with ship's business, Number One.

03:19.782 --> 03:24.661
Suffice it to say,
it is strictly a matter of image.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.457
Relax, Wes,
you'll do fine on your exams.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.626

- lt's Captain Picard.
- Why? He's not taking the exams.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.300
lt's just the two of us
in a shuttlecraft for six hours.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.553
What am l gonna talk
to Captain Picard about for six hours?

03:41.763 --> 03:44.806
Oh, archeology, semantics,

15:15.205 --> 15:17.123
- Come in.
- Yes, commander, go ahead.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.374
Are you all right?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.460
Sure. Why do you ask?

15:20.669 --> 15:22.712
Counselor Troi

15:22.880 --> 15:25.173
about your absence
from the Enterprise.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.676
Ha, ha. l don't think there's anything
to worry about.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.763
Understood.
As soon as you complete the repairs,

15:31.931 --> 15:32.972
l want you back here.

15:33.140 --> 15:37.101
Yes, sir.
I should be done here momentarily.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.149
See? Like that.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.448
Okay.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.369

Well, your guidance is operational,

a little bit longer than l anticipated.

l guess you would have preferred
Commander Riker

16:48.716 --> 16:50.466
as a traveling companion.

What?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.930
lt's okay.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.599
You're not too comfortable with me.

l understand.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.735
Wesley, that's not true.
You're a fine young man.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.404
You don't have to say that, sir.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.740
lt's pretty obvious how you feel.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.242
ls it? How so?

17:16.952 --> 17:19.996
Everyone knows. You don't like kids.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.126
That's too bad.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.587
You might have made a good father.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.763
Thank you.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.731
Didn't you ever wish you had kids

17:51.528 --> 17:54.447
Wishing for a thing
does not make it so.

We send him over there
for one set of repairs,

18:12.049 --> 18:13.257

18:13.467 --> 18:16.344
Apparently, their ship is quite fragile.

This is Riker on the Enterprise.

Almost got it, commander.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.561
We look for things.

back onboard our ship.

All done, commander.

A shield? What kind?

19:20.742 --> 19:22.660
lt appears to be
beyond their technology,

19:22.870 --> 19:24.912

No, thank you, sir.

Thank you, sir.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.429
Never had the time.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.015
Don't you ever get lonely?

21:10.352 --> 21:14.689
For ambitious Starfleet officers,
there are certain costs involved.

21:16.650 --> 21:20.444
We must be cautious
of long-term commitments, Wesley.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.530
No problem.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.950
Where women are concerned,
l am in complete control.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.537
Really? Hmm.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.123
l always rather had to work at that.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.837
Have you always been
so disciplined?

21:39.506 --> 21:41.007
Good Lord, no.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.467
lf l was,
l wouldn't have this problem.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.721
l don't understand.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.308
Well...

21:53.228 --> 21:54.687
l was a young Starfleet officer,

21:54.896 --> 21:57.648
not many years older
than you are now.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.068
Top of my Academy class,

22:01.653 --> 22:03.696
green as hell,

22:04.197 --> 22:06.532
and, oh, so cocky.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.243
Too cocky, as it turned out.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.120
What happened?

22:11.330 --> 22:16.250
Several friends and l were on leave
at Farspace Starbase Earhart.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.379
That was little more
than a galactic outpost in those days.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.757
Was this before the Klingons
joined the Federation?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.092
That's right.

22:25.469 --> 22:31.807
Well, my mates and l were
at the Bonestell Recreation Facility,

22:32.351 --> 22:36.145
which was something of a dead,
rough crossroads at the time

22:36.355 --> 22:42.109
filled with an assorted bunch
of galactic riffraff,

22:42.778 --> 22:47.782
when a trio of Nausicaans came in.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.368
They were clearly spoiling
for a confrontation

22:50.577 --> 22:53.746
with a group
of fresh-faced Starfleet officers

22:53.914 --> 22:55.247
such as ourselves.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.375
Well, everyone in the group
had the good sense

22:57.542 --> 23:01.295
to give these Nausicaans
a wide berth, standoff.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.090
Everyone, that is, except me.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.385
l stood toe-to-toe
with the worst of the three

23:07.594 --> 23:10.638
and l told him what l thought of him,
his pals, his planet,

23:10.847 --> 23:13.057
and l possibly made
some passing reference

23:13.266 --> 23:15.309
to his questionable parentage.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.729
And the next thing l knew
all three of them were on me

23:18.939 --> 23:21.315
and l was fighting for my life.

23:22.150 --> 23:25.403
l was actually doing quite well
for a while too.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.280
You fought them and won?

23:29.449 --> 23:34.870
l had this one Nausicaan down
in this somewhat devious joint lock

23:35.080 --> 23:40.084
when, uh, unbeknownst to me,
one of his chums drew his weapon

23:40.293 --> 23:41.752
and impaled me through the back.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.798
Curious sensation, actually.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.466
Not much pain.

23:47.676 --> 23:53.097
Shock, certainly,
at the sight of, uh, serrated metal

23:53.306 --> 23:54.890
sticking through my chest.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.352
A sudden giddy warmth.

23:58.562 --> 24:03.524
ln fact, l do actually remember
that l laughed out loud.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.902
Well, it pierced my heart, of course.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.073
Well, if we had not been so near
to a medical facility,

24:11.283 --> 24:12.450
l would surely have died.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.410
Really?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.704
Then what happened?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.831
Nothing.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.125
l was no hero, Wesley.

24:22.085 --> 24:26.630
l was an undisciplined, loud-mouthed,
opinionated young man

24:26.840 --> 24:29.300
who was way out of his league.

24:32.053 --> 24:36.640
l learned a very hard
and painful lesson that day.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.851
But l learned it well.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.687
l hope you never have
to learn it the same way.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.152

- Please.

to give you weapons.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.665
You will make more.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.001

25:47.796 --> 25:51.257
Commander, a photon torpedo
may penetrate their shield.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.260
Any hostile move on our part
could jeopardize Geordi.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.721
Agreed.
But what do the Pakleds want?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.598

25:59.808 --> 26:02.601
They have what they want. For now.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.280
We're approaching Starbase 51 5,

26:16.074 --> 26:17.950
At last.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.421
Did you read that book l gave you?

26:32.632 --> 26:34.049
Some of it.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.137
That's reassuring.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.724
l just don't have much time.

26:42.142 --> 26:46.312
There is no greater challenge
than the study of philosophy.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.356
Well, William James
won't be on my Starfleet exams.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.234
Heh.
The important things never will be.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.361
Anyone can be trained

26:54.529 --> 26:58.657
in the mechanics
of piloting a starship.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.243
- ln Starfleet Academy--
- lt takes more.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.580
Open your mind to the past.

27:04.789 --> 27:08.334

27:09.544 --> 27:12.588
And all this may mean something.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.262
lt's all deception.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.849
Nothing the Pakleds have said or done
has been sincere.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.226
lntensified scan
shows their guidance system

27:26.436 --> 27:29.772
to be perfectly intact,
as is their power generator.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.650
Then what was Geordi repairing?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.818
Apparently,
the putative malfunctions

27:35.028 --> 27:37.196
were carefully programmed
into their ship's computer.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.823
l didn't even think the Pakleds
had that kind of technology.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.202
They seem to have made technological
leaps forward, commander.

27:43.411 --> 27:46.038
Why would they go through
this charade of needing our help?

27:46.247 --> 27:47.289
For the sole purpose

27:47.457 --> 27:50.584
of making Lieutenant La Forge
their prisoner.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.638
We have arrived at Starbase 51 5.

I'm still quite uneasy
despite assurances

28:05.475 --> 28:09.269
that this medical procedure
poses little risk.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.231
l hope you won't be late

28:12.440 --> 28:14.692
Oh, l still have some time, sir.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.487
Why do l get the distinct impression

28:18.697 --> 28:21.407
that you're acting
like some kind of escort?

28:23.284 --> 28:27.496
Dr. Pulaski asked me to make sure
that you actually went inside.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.624
That woman.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.292
- She would.
- Sir.

Yes, what is it, ensign?

28:35.964 --> 28:38.215
l enjoyed our trip together, sir.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.552
So did l.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.312
They are initiating visual contact, sir.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.440
Maybe now we'll find out
what they really want.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.609

29:14.544 --> 29:16.670
You think we are not smart.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.633
l think you need

29:22.427 --> 29:24.052
We are smart.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.015
Prove it. Return our man to us.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.892
You want him?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.394
Yes, damn it.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.022
Good.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.692
We want all computer information
from your ship.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.237
Now.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.794
We've got a man held hostage
by alien forces

29:57.003 --> 29:59.087
and all l have are no-option options.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.380
l need some input.

30:00.590 --> 30:01.965

30:02.175 --> 30:04.927
He's already been hit
by multiple phaser stuns.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.012
He could need medical attention.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.932
Security team stands ready
to take the initiative, sir.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.643
- Data.
- Our options have not changed.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.729
We can either respond
to the Pakled demand or not.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.398
We can either use force or not.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.151
Allowing them access to our computer
is a complete breach

30:21.319 --> 30:22.486
of Starfleet security.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.822
Then force it must be.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.169
Don't worry about a thing, captain.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.339
We've done this a hundred times
and we're ready when you are.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.425
Just get on with it, doctor.
l have work to do.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.428
Activate sterile field.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.849
Neural calipers.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.069
This will be
a secondary cardiac procedure

31:04.279 --> 31:08.323
with midline entry
and excision of the early model unit.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.534
l anticipate no complications

31:10.743 --> 31:13.412
as the patient
has had positive primary results

31:13.621 --> 31:16.331
and exhibits
extraordinary physical condition.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.959
We'll all be home in time for dinner.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.336
Tissue mitigator.

31:25.925 --> 31:29.094
There is limited information available
on the Pakled culture.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.096
But the eclectic range
of their equipment

31:31.306 --> 31:33.724
suggests that their technology
was borrowed from others.

31:33.933 --> 31:37.019
- And now they've become militant.
- So it would seem.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.478
Rationale?

31:39.188 --> 31:40.564
They're unwilling to wait

31:40.773 --> 31:44.776
for the timely evolution
of their species' intellectual capacity.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.989
They want instant knowledge,
instant power and gratification.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.949
More they get, the more they want.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.952
And the more aggressive
and dangerous they become.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.787
l think it's time we set some limits.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.164

To what effect, sir?

31:57.373 --> 31:59.875
We are faced
with an impossible conundrum.

32:00.084 --> 32:03.295
Suppose we turn their impatience
and greed against them.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.671
But how?

32:04.881 --> 32:07.007
Perhaps Geordi should give them
something they want,

32:07.216 --> 32:08.467
something important,

32:08.676 --> 32:10.177
then we simply create
the right moment

32:10.345 --> 32:13.305
for him to take it away
and get him the hell out of there.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.141
Would you be suggesting a ruse
of some sort?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.726
l would.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.937
But what if we fail?

32:20.146 --> 32:21.521
What will happen to Geordi then?

32:21.689 --> 32:23.273
We have no other choice.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.983
We have to try.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.742
There's been
some capillary reaction here.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.286
Let's proceed carefully.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.706
We'll need sharper focus
on the thoracic polychromatics

32:39.916 --> 32:44.336
and verification
of myocardial enzyme balance.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.470
Hey.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.223
Let me talk to them.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.600
l'll get you their computer banks.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.185
We wanna be smart.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.813
So open the hailing frequency.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.523
They'll listen to me.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.401
We are smart.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.278
We need their computer things.

33:10.488 --> 33:14.574
Yes.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.787
- Commander Riker.
- Yes, lieutenant, we're here.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.165
The Pakleds seem pretty sincere.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.001
We want what we want.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.128
Our computer banks
are non-negotiable.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.629
GREBNEDLOG:
We want them.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.800
Believe me,
they're nothing if not persistent.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.136
We want to be nothing
if not persistent.

33:34.303 --> 33:38.181
Heh. Nobody ever said
they were great conversationalists.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.600
Where did they get their shields?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.644
Yes, we like shields.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.648
Well, from what l've seen,
half the systems onboard this ship

33:46.858 --> 33:49.693
have been stolen
from the Romulans, Klingon, Jarada,

33:49.902 --> 33:52.738
just about anyone
they've ever come in contact with.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.865
We like to be smart.

33:55.408 --> 33:59.369
Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge,
they steal technology.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.080
But they lack the ability
to use it properly.

34:02.915 --> 34:06.293
You're an excellent chief engineer,
Lieutenant La Forge.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.753
Thank you, sir.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.756
And, of course, your knowledge
of phaser and photon weaponry

34:10.965 --> 34:12.257
is unmatched.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.261
Well, that's nice of you to say, sir,
but it's really Lieutenant Worf that--

34:16.471 --> 34:18.930
Our missions
are always inherently dangerous.

34:19.140 --> 34:22.434
And any of us could be called upon
to make the ultimate sacrifice

34:22.643 --> 34:23.727
at any time.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.771
Well, yes, sir, but--

34:25.980 --> 34:30.692
Speaking of time,
this may be your time.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.944

Uh-huh. Uh...

34:41.579 --> 34:46.041
And l guess you'll just have to arm
your photon torpedoes without me.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.586
As well as our hydrogen collectors.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.296
Fond farewell.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.132
He knows about weapons.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.301
You can make us strong.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.637
Well, it's not something
I really like to talk about.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.348
Any classified weapons knowledge
you share with your captors

35:01.557 --> 35:03.058
will be considered treason.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.060
But l may have no choice.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.729
You will die without honor.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.773
Heh. Thanks a lot, Worf.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.804
the entire crew must know.

43:21.348 --> 43:24.601
You're still the captain. lnvincible.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.271
Huh. Thank you.

43:45.914 --> 43:47.415
l beg your pardon.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.293
Looks like things
are back to normal.

43:51.337 --> 43:54.380
l'm pleased to report that Ensign
Crusher's Starfleet exam results

43:54.590 --> 43:58.051
permit him to continue his studies
onboard the Enterprise.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.638
Furthermore, any rumors
of my brush with death

44:01.805 --> 44:03.139
are greatly exaggerated.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.975
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.

44:06.185 --> 44:12.148
Then, Ensign Crusher, set course
for the Epsilon sector, warp 5.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.067
Engage.
