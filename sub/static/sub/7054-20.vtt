00:01.375 --> 00:03.349
Tell me about
<i>The First People</i>.

00:03.433 --> 00:04.417
Start with why those books

00:04.484 --> 00:05.735
seem to indicate
that you wrote them.

00:05.802 --> 00:08.437
Then move on to what the device
is intended for.

00:08.488 --> 00:10.106
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:10.157 --> 00:12.308
Whatever is happening
between the two universes...

00:12.359 --> 00:13.642
Whatever our fate is,

00:13.693 --> 00:14.927
I'm right at the center of it.

00:14.995 --> 00:17.330
When I touched that device,

00:17.397 --> 00:18.447
it came alive in my hands.

00:18.498 --> 00:20.716
How can you expect me
to ignore that?

00:20.784 --> 00:23.953
I asked you not to work on
that device in my lab.

00:24.004 --> 00:24.954
You're playing with fire.

00:25.005 --> 00:27.623
They're working on it
on the other side.

00:27.674 --> 00:29.675
We need to understand
exactly what it does.

00:31.011 --> 00:33.679
You are the mother
of my grandchild.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.965
Did you get the sample?

00:41.638 --> 00:44.557
So where do we stand?

00:44.641 --> 00:46.025
We've doubled the thickness
of the lead shielding

00:46.109 --> 00:47.393
around the machine.

00:47.477 --> 00:50.012
Good. You let me know as soon as
the Faraday cage is completed.

00:50.063 --> 00:51.731
I'm told they're almost done.

00:51.815 --> 00:53.699
You really think
this is all necessary?

00:53.784 --> 00:55.401
We're standing underneath
a giant lightning rod.

00:55.485 --> 00:57.570
It's unclear what kind of
electrostatic discharge

00:57.654 --> 00:59.322
the device may give off.

00:59.373 --> 01:00.689
Good morning.

01:00.741 --> 01:04.693
If you'll all excuse us,
please.

01:09.383 --> 01:11.867
Based on Olivia Dunham's
DNA profile,

01:11.918 --> 01:14.470
we were able to
identify 23 chromosomes

01:14.537 --> 01:16.555
your grandson
inherited from his mother

01:16.640 --> 01:18.924
and strip them out.

01:19.009 --> 01:21.210
Of course, that leaves us
with only half

01:21.261 --> 01:23.045
of Peter's full
genetic profile.

01:23.096 --> 01:25.714
But hopefully that's enough
to activate the machine.

01:25.766 --> 01:30.886
- How long before we're ready?
- It should be within the hour.

01:30.937 --> 01:34.490
Sir, history may never fully
know what we've done here.

01:34.557 --> 01:38.394
How we've saved our universe.

01:38.445 --> 01:40.162
I'm proud to be a part of it.

01:42.566 --> 01:45.901
Oppenheimer saved us too.

01:45.952 --> 01:49.071
But at what cost?

01:49.122 --> 01:51.507
He couldn't bear
the nightmares--

01:51.574 --> 01:54.960
The screams of all
the innocents he had killed.

01:58.098 --> 02:04.687
"Now, I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

02:04.755 --> 02:08.691
Only in our case,
that really is true.

02:08.758 --> 02:12.161
We destroyed their world
to save ours.

02:17.534 --> 02:19.985
May God have mercy on us.

Hey, Joe, come in.

02:52.069 --> 02:55.004
You know what time it is,
don't you, Rich?

02:55.072 --> 02:55.988
<i>Listen,
you've got to get up here.</i>

02:56.073 --> 02:57.523
6:00 A.M.

02:57.607 --> 02:59.692
That means I'm having
my breakfast right now.

02:59.776 --> 03:02.278
This is serious.
You've gotta get up here.

03:02.329 --> 03:03.362
Something's spooking the sheep.

03:03.447 --> 03:04.480
<i>They're going crazy.</i>

03:04.531 --> 03:09.368
All right.
I'm on my way.

03:34.311 --> 03:35.694
I just hit
a swarm of locusts!

03:35.779 --> 03:39.181
It's like the blessed
apocalypse.

03:39.232 --> 03:41.367
Yeah, well, the sheep
are acting like it is.

03:41.451 --> 03:43.619
I tried to round 'em up,
get 'em back to the barn,

03:43.686 --> 03:44.870
but they won't budge.

03:48.158 --> 03:51.243
Gimme your walkie.

03:51.328 --> 03:52.861
Everybody listen up.

03:52.913 --> 03:53.996
This is Joe.

03:54.047 --> 03:56.582
I need all hands
in the north field.

03:59.586 --> 04:01.703
What is that?

Damn it!

04:30.237 --> 04:33.255
Some days you've got it,
Donnie,

04:33.323 --> 04:34.406
some days you don't.

04:34.457 --> 04:37.459
I'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.203
Good morning, Olivia.

06:45.255 --> 06:46.789
I didn't know you were
spending the night.

06:46.856 --> 06:48.057
What a lovely surprise.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.809
Oh, no,
the surprise is all mine.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.063
I am going to pop another
mushroom frittata into the oven.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.348
I got some
morels from the market

06:56.399 --> 06:57.733
with the biggest caps
you've ever seen.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.219
Sure.

07:01.271 --> 07:03.221
- Olivia.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:03.273 --> 07:05.657
You should get some slippers
for when you stay over here.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.443
This house can get very chilly.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.911
Right. Okay.

07:08.995 --> 07:13.115
♪ Find some magic mushrooms
and they put them in the stew. ♪

07:19.205 --> 07:20.456
What time is it?

07:20.540 --> 07:23.042
It's 6:30 in the morning.
Oh, God.

07:23.093 --> 07:25.577
And, uh, your father

07:25.628 --> 07:28.380
is walking around the house
naked.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.550
Oh, yeah, it's Tuesday.

07:32.936 --> 07:35.220
He always cooks naked
on Tuesdays.

07:35.271 --> 07:36.922
Is that safe?

07:36.973 --> 07:39.641
Uh-uh.
It's not pretty either.

07:39.726 --> 07:43.779
- But you get used to it.
- Hmm.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.905
I could get used to this.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.282
This is
my favorite time of day.

08:04.334 --> 08:07.770
The sunrise,

08:07.837 --> 08:13.725
when the world
is full of promise.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.968
Well, that's not.

08:38.835 --> 08:40.169
Oh, my.

08:40.236 --> 08:41.503
A ranch foreman
and a farmhand

08:41.587 --> 08:42.871
are confirmed missing,

08:42.938 --> 08:44.923
along with
an entire herd of sheep.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.592
Over 500 head gone.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.611
- How is that possible?
- You tell me.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.597
No hurricanes or tornadoes
in the area.

08:51.664 --> 08:52.881
Barometers remained steady.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.716
There's an army base
about twenty miles from here.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.502
I thought that too,
but we ruled out weapons testing.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.054
Whatever happened here,
we didn't cause it.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.773
I wouldn't bet the farm on that.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.726
When did this happen?
Do we have a time on the incident?

09:04.811 --> 09:06.945
6:05 A.M.,
give or take a few minutes

09:07.013 --> 09:08.897
depending on
the individual report.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.899
That man owns
the neighboring property.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.285
He was outside when it happened.
I'd like you to question him.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.687
Sure.

09:15.738 --> 09:19.741
Peter! A hand!
Come quickly!

09:22.128 --> 09:25.831
This granite contains
quartz crystals.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.834
My electrometer.

09:28.885 --> 09:31.887
Quartz crystals only develop
an electrical potential

09:31.971 --> 09:33.222
when they're put
under physical pressure.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.591
Extreme physical pressure

09:35.675 --> 09:38.260
caused by
a major gravitational event.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.813
Highly charged, of course.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.600
And I suppose
you have a theory?

09:44.684 --> 09:49.387
I believe that a vortex
appeared above this field,

09:49.439 --> 09:50.989
consuming everything
in its path.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.725
My worst fear is realized--

09:53.776 --> 09:55.911
Our world
is breaking down around us.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.996
- Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
- I'm not.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.282
Even if that is true,
Walter, why now?

10:00.366 --> 10:02.117
What would trigger a vortex?

10:02.202 --> 10:06.255
That's a good question.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.007
This is clearance Double A.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.876
I want all unnecessary
personnel sent home.

10:10.927 --> 10:12.044
I've issued the bulletin.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.411
All right. How many
on duty when it started?

10:13.463 --> 10:14.680
Four.
It was a skeletal crew.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.465
And we're sure it wasn't
tampered with?

10:16.549 --> 10:18.083
It wasn't.
We reviewed the footage.

10:18.134 --> 10:21.470
With all due respect,
there's no way.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.440
Get me Agent Broyles.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.427
Yes. Hello, Nina.

10:29.479 --> 10:31.463
<i>Phillip, the machine came on.</i>

10:31.531 --> 10:32.764
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

10:32.815 --> 10:33.982
I can hear you. Go on.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.069
<i>The machine came on by itself,
without Peter.</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:38.436
When?

10:38.488 --> 10:40.706
6:02 A.M.
There was no warning.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.041
<i>Is that noise the machine?</i>

10:46.029 --> 10:49.881
Tell Walter it's on.
He needs to know.

11:02.436 --> 11:03.353
What do you mean,
the machine is activated?

11:03.437 --> 11:05.138
Apparently,
it powered up by itself.

11:05.189 --> 11:07.607
It appears
our assumptions were wrong.

11:07.658 --> 11:09.308
What time did this happen?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.827
Just after 6:00
this morning.

11:10.911 --> 11:13.663
Of course.
That's the reason.

11:13.747 --> 11:16.616
The machine activated
just after 6:00,

11:16.667 --> 11:18.535
just minutes before
the vortex opened.

11:18.619 --> 11:21.421
So you think it caused this?

11:21.488 --> 11:27.377
Yes, and if it's
the end of the world...

11:27.461 --> 11:30.013
This is just the beginning.

11:32.299 --> 11:34.717
- Anything?
- This is worthless.

11:34.802 --> 11:35.802
Peter.

11:35.853 --> 11:36.886
Up until now,
we've been operating

11:36.971 --> 11:38.521
under the assumption
that I was somehow

11:38.606 --> 11:39.522
the power source
for this machine,

11:39.607 --> 11:40.874
but clearly that was wrong.

11:40.941 --> 11:42.642
You're the only one that
the machine's responded to.

11:42.693 --> 11:44.027
You've said so yourself.

11:44.111 --> 11:46.496
And yet it turned itself on
while I was 200 miles away.

11:46.564 --> 11:49.232
- So how do we explain that?
- I think I understand.

11:49.316 --> 11:52.652
The machine's magnetic field
is warped in a pattern

11:52.703 --> 11:54.404
I've only seen one other time.

11:54.488 --> 11:56.739
The typewriter that
the other Olivia used

11:56.824 --> 11:58.741
to communicate
with the other side.

11:58.826 --> 12:00.243
What are you suggesting,
Walter?

12:00.327 --> 12:01.794
- Quantum entanglement.
- I'm afraid so.

12:01.862 --> 12:04.247
You think the Walternate turned
the machine on over there?

12:04.331 --> 12:06.833
Which triggered
a sympathetic response

12:06.884 --> 12:08.534
from the one over here.
Yes, it makes sense.

12:08.586 --> 12:10.369
But how? I mean, how could
he do that without Peter?

12:10.421 --> 12:13.506
There's not much we do know for sure.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.425
I just got off
the phone with Broyles.

12:15.509 --> 12:17.477
Three more reported incidents.

12:17.544 --> 12:20.180
Massive colonies of bats

12:20.231 --> 12:22.148
were spotted above
the New Jersey turnpike.

12:22.216 --> 12:23.566
Mini quakes in Florida.

12:23.651 --> 12:27.220
And in Newton, thirty acres of
woodland completely decimated.

12:27.271 --> 12:30.607
All organic life
just dead and desiccated

12:30.691 --> 12:32.358
in a matter of hours.

12:32.409 --> 12:33.726
The blight.

12:37.164 --> 12:41.618
At this point,
I believe that the events

12:41.685 --> 12:46.022
will begin to increase
exponentially.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.924
And there's no way
to stop it.

12:48.008 --> 12:50.627
He's won.

12:50.711 --> 12:53.630
Walternate has won.

13:01.722 --> 13:03.973
Oh! It's chilly!

13:04.058 --> 13:05.925
Well, Dr. Marna
said two weeks,

13:05.976 --> 13:07.927
and he's three weeks old
yesterday.

13:07.978 --> 13:09.145
You worry too much.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.931
Besides, the fresh air's
gonna do him some good.

13:11.982 --> 13:14.651
Look at him, just kind of
sizing up the world.

13:14.735 --> 13:16.119
He's alert, that one.

13:16.203 --> 13:20.290
You know, it is kind of windy.
So will you humor me?

13:20.374 --> 13:24.627
Here.
Oh, nice and warm.

13:27.298 --> 13:28.414
- Oh.
- Let me.

13:28.465 --> 13:31.134
See, it's supposed to be
my day off.

13:31.218 --> 13:32.335
Not the first time
we've heard that.

13:35.506 --> 13:37.957
We'll be okay
if you have to go.

13:39.677 --> 13:44.097
Heh!
You are such a nugget.

13:45.966 --> 13:48.101
Oh, I know. Mwah!

13:48.152 --> 13:51.137
I love you.

13:51.188 --> 13:52.572
All right, I'll call you

13:52.639 --> 13:54.490
when I have some idea of
what time I'm gonna be home.

13:54.575 --> 13:56.276
Okay. Don't worry,
I'll keep him safe.

13:56.327 --> 13:59.829
- You just keep the rest of us safe.
- Okay.

13:59.913 --> 14:03.499
The lookers have detected
a spatial discontinuity.

14:03.584 --> 14:04.650
Okay. How bad?

14:04.702 --> 14:05.918
Power density spikes

14:05.986 --> 14:09.205
reaching over 3,000 milliwatts
per square meter,

14:09.290 --> 14:10.456
and that's 200 meters
away from the focal point.

14:10.507 --> 14:11.841
This is a Class 9 event?

14:11.925 --> 14:13.126
No, it's a 10.

14:13.177 --> 14:15.295
The power spikes are coming
from Liberty Island.

14:15.346 --> 14:16.929
The D.O.D. complex.

14:16.997 --> 14:19.999
Charlie and the evacuation
teams are en route.

14:20.050 --> 14:23.770
Okay, air quality normal.
No need for oxygen. Let's go.

14:23.837 --> 14:26.839
This is Agent Lee.

14:26.890 --> 14:30.610
We're still seeing
dangerously high levels.

14:30.677 --> 14:33.196
Understood, Mr. Secretary.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.200
False alarm!
Let's pack it back up!

14:37.284 --> 14:39.018
Yeah, stand down.
Let's go, come on.

14:39.069 --> 14:40.403
What's going on?

14:40.487 --> 14:42.488
We've been ordered
to stand down.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.657
But what about
the energy surges?

14:44.708 --> 14:46.376
They're still happening.

14:46.460 --> 14:48.461
Well, did they give you
any reasons as to why?

14:48.528 --> 14:53.466
Explanations
are above my pay grade.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.318
I think I know who to ask.

14:55.386 --> 14:59.639
Damn it.

14:59.707 --> 15:02.041
No measurable improvement?

15:02.092 --> 15:04.327
Environmental degradation
levels haven't changed

15:04.395 --> 15:07.814
since the device was activated.

15:07.881 --> 15:09.649
Reversing
this many years of damage

15:09.716 --> 15:11.651
will take longer
than a few hours.

15:14.405 --> 15:17.490
<i>Mr. Secretary,
Olivia Dunham is here to see you.</i>

15:17.557 --> 15:21.160
Send her in.

15:21.228 --> 15:24.530
Let me know
if anything changes.

15:31.088 --> 15:32.505
Olivia.

15:34.675 --> 15:36.793
I'd hoped you brought Henry.

15:36.877 --> 15:37.927
Uh, he's with the nanny.

15:38.011 --> 15:39.545
I'm actually on duty
at the moment, sir.

15:39.596 --> 15:43.383
So this is
a professional visit?

15:43.434 --> 15:46.469
Fringe Division identified
a Class 10 energy surge

15:46.537 --> 15:49.872
emanating from this complex,
which would normally justify

15:49.957 --> 15:52.125
evacuating a ten-mile radius
around the epicenter.

15:52.192 --> 15:54.744
There's no danger
for the general public.

15:54.812 --> 15:56.729
We've taken proper precautions.

15:56.797 --> 15:59.849
Of course.
I wasn't suggesting otherwise.

16:02.319 --> 16:05.704
When I was returning
from over there,

16:05.756 --> 16:08.141
you had me steal
a piece of tech.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.393
Tech that you said
was part of a weapon

16:10.461 --> 16:14.313
that could destroy
the other side.

16:14.381 --> 16:18.017
What exactly are you asking,
Olivia?

16:18.068 --> 16:22.922
Have you activated that weapon?

16:22.990 --> 16:25.324
Is that what's causing
the surge?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.665
That's classified.

16:32.732 --> 16:34.283
What's going to happen
to the people over there?

16:34.351 --> 16:36.769
My concern is for
the people of our world.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.904
But your son is over there.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.011
I'm aware.

16:48.599 --> 16:50.433
Peter chose to leave.

16:50.501 --> 16:54.303
He chose his allegiance.

16:54.388 --> 16:59.158
I chose to give up my son
so that you could keep yours.

17:01.778 --> 17:04.096
Now, if there's nothing further...

17:12.398 --> 17:13.816
So what do we do?

17:13.884 --> 17:15.818
What if we just broke it back
down into its component parts?

17:15.886 --> 17:17.920
With the amount of energy
this machine is generating,

17:17.988 --> 17:19.188
I don't know what would happen.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.656
The machine
is quantum entangled.

17:20.723 --> 17:23.492
It could tear us apart with the energy
from the other side alone.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.993
And is that more dangerous

17:25.060 --> 17:26.863
than vortexes putting
holes in our universe?

17:26.914 --> 17:29.749
Walter, our world is
tearing apart at the seams.

17:29.833 --> 17:32.618
Still, I'm afraid
anything we might do

17:32.703 --> 17:35.588
could have
devastating consequences.

17:35.672 --> 17:37.540
I just spoke to Nina.
I was right.

17:37.591 --> 17:40.259
They picked up
an electromagnetic spike

17:40.327 --> 17:42.445
at 5:47 this morning
in upstate New York.

17:42.513 --> 17:45.014
Fifteen minutes before
the vortex opened.

17:45.082 --> 17:48.301
Is that how they predict
anomalies on the other side?

17:48.385 --> 17:52.855
They also look for odd thermal patterns
and radiation spikes.

17:52.923 --> 17:54.757
I've got Nina
tracking all three.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.926
An early warning system.

17:56.977 --> 17:59.445
Well, at least
we'll be able to warn people.

17:59.530 --> 18:02.882
And maybe save some lives.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.267
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Massive Dynamic

18:05.319 --> 18:08.321
and help Nina
with the protocol.

18:08.405 --> 18:11.123
Olivia.

18:16.463 --> 18:20.883
I'll call you when
I get to New York.

18:20.951 --> 18:23.553
Can you let me know if Walter
comes up with anything?

18:23.620 --> 18:25.471
There's got to be a way
to stop the machine.

18:34.965 --> 18:38.651
Perhaps if we encased
the entire machine in lead,

18:38.735 --> 18:42.655
contained the energy
it's emitting.

18:42.739 --> 18:46.308
Walter.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.363
We both know
there's another way.

18:55.819 --> 18:57.703
It makes sense, Walter.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.873
We all thought that
I could turn the machine on.

19:00.958 --> 19:02.708
Maybe I can turn it off.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.377
Maybe that's what
the drawing means.

19:04.461 --> 19:06.879
We don't know
what the drawing means.

19:06.964 --> 19:09.265
If your theory is accurate,

19:09.332 --> 19:10.800
we're running out of time.

19:18.058 --> 19:21.727
And the way that machine
responded to me

19:21.795 --> 19:23.779
after I touched it,

19:23.847 --> 19:26.181
it's like it's
been calling out to me.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.951
Every piece of data we have
about the machine

19:29.019 --> 19:31.537
points to one conclusion.

19:31.622 --> 19:36.125
Somehow, that machine
was made for me.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.477
Peter, you could die.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.664
And if we do nothing,
we're all gonna die.

19:56.313 --> 19:58.714
"Give him the keys
and save the girl."

19:58.782 --> 20:00.766
What?

20:00.851 --> 20:03.819
This is what he was doing.
He was preparing me.

20:03.887 --> 20:06.972
- Who?
- The observer.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.491
He was preparing me

20:08.558 --> 20:11.827
because he knew I would
have to let you go.

20:11.895 --> 20:15.064
That I would...

20:15.115 --> 20:18.400
That I would have to
sacrifice you

20:18.452 --> 20:22.004
to fix the problems
I'd created.

20:31.247 --> 20:35.184
I think this is
what I'm supposed to do.

20:38.855 --> 20:41.657
But I can't do it
without your help.

21:00.110 --> 21:02.611
<i>Police and fire
departments have been responding</i>

21:02.662 --> 21:03.996
<i>to unexplained
weather phenomena</i>

21:04.081 --> 21:05.414
<i>up and down
the eastern seaboard</i>

21:05.465 --> 21:06.966
<i>for the last 24 hours.</i>

21:07.050 --> 21:09.752
<i>The National Weather Service
has released a storm advisory</i>

21:09.803 --> 21:11.470
<i>for the entire east coast.</i>

21:11.555 --> 21:15.341
What do you mean, he's gone?
He has to be somewhere.

21:15.425 --> 21:17.476
He didn't just disappear.

21:17.561 --> 21:19.228
There's always a trail.
Keep looking.

21:20.296 --> 21:21.313
Yes?

21:21.398 --> 21:22.932
<i>Agent Dunham has arrived.</i>

21:22.983 --> 21:24.800
Oh, good. Send her in.

21:28.989 --> 21:31.574
- Nina.
- We're moving forward as you requested.

21:31.641 --> 21:32.742
I've assembled a team.

21:32.809 --> 21:34.326
I've briefed them on
the protocol you outlined.

21:34.411 --> 21:36.695
Okay, good. So where are we
in terms of coverage?

21:36.780 --> 21:38.197
Well, I've tasked
all of our satellites

21:38.281 --> 21:39.799
to focus on
the northeast states.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.251
So this is where the thermal
detection is up and running?

21:42.318 --> 21:43.919
Yes, but it's far from complete.

21:43.987 --> 21:46.005
It does give us lead time,
however,

21:46.089 --> 21:48.457
if a vortex starts forming
in a densely populated area.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.092
What about the
electromagnetic disturbances?

21:50.160 --> 21:53.012
We've re-calibrated our
entire cell tower network

21:53.096 --> 21:54.263
to warn us if any are detected.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.331
And amber?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.017
All right,
there we've hit a wall.

21:58.101 --> 21:59.969
We have enough amber

22:00.020 --> 22:01.837
to contain eight,
maybe ten events.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.022
But beyond that,

22:03.106 --> 22:04.890
our chemists are having
a great deal of difficulty

22:04.975 --> 22:06.725
finding some of
the more rare elements.

22:06.810 --> 22:11.013
Without the amber,
early detection is irrelevant.

22:15.485 --> 22:17.236
Yes, well...

22:18.955 --> 22:22.041
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

22:22.125 --> 22:25.327
What do you mean,
it wasn't supposed to be this way?

22:25.378 --> 22:26.378
I was told on good authority

22:26.463 --> 22:27.663
that if you and Peter
were together,

22:27.714 --> 22:28.881
it would all work out.

22:28.965 --> 22:33.219
What are you talking about?
On whose authority?

22:33.303 --> 22:35.638
There's a man
that William knew.

22:35.705 --> 22:37.206
I'm not sure where they met.

22:37.257 --> 22:38.891
But he had
great confidence in him.

22:38.975 --> 22:40.392
He trusted him implicitly.

22:40.477 --> 22:41.894
He advised me to do the same.

22:41.978 --> 22:45.181
After William went missing,
when circumstances warranted,

22:45.232 --> 22:46.515
I would consult with him.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.517
This man knows a great deal
about the machine.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.986
And you didn't think it was
worth mentioning until now?

22:51.054 --> 22:52.905
No, he said if I divulged
what he had told me

22:52.989 --> 22:55.191
that I would never see
or hear from him again.

22:55.242 --> 22:57.359
I didn't want to risk
losing that connection.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.529
Nina, our universe
is breaking down.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.915
If this man has any
information about the machine,

23:02.999 --> 23:05.534
then I need to know who he is
and what he told you.

23:05.602 --> 23:07.586
You've already met him.

23:07.671 --> 23:09.421
Sam Weiss.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.792
William told me
he possessed knowledge

23:13.877 --> 23:15.427
beyond anything I could fathom,

23:15.512 --> 23:18.347
but even I never suspected
anything of this magnitude.

23:18.414 --> 23:19.765
So how'd you find out?

23:19.850 --> 23:20.866
The authors. Anagrams.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.384
I figured it out
a few weeks ago.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.469
Even the Hebrew
and Russian ones

23:23.553 --> 23:25.120
are phonetic scramblings
of his name.

23:25.188 --> 23:26.755
We've been through these books
hundreds of times.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.190
So what else does he know?

23:28.258 --> 23:30.192
I think you and I both know
that Sam will reveal

23:30.260 --> 23:31.227
only what he wants to.

23:31.278 --> 23:32.761
Not this time.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.046
If you track him down.

23:34.114 --> 23:35.814
We don't have
an address for him.

23:35.899 --> 23:38.150
He disconnected his phone,
shut down the bowling alley.

23:38.235 --> 23:40.035
Nobody has seen him since.

23:40.103 --> 23:42.238
If there's even a chance that
he can turn this machine off,

23:42.289 --> 23:43.889
then I have to speak to him.

23:43.957 --> 23:46.458
I'll find him.

23:49.546 --> 23:50.629
I need the keys, Jeanie.

23:50.714 --> 23:52.081
Catch me.

23:52.132 --> 23:54.083
- Jeanie.
- Nope.

23:54.134 --> 23:55.417
- Jeanie.
- No.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.802
You're--

24:02.292 --> 24:05.761
- I didn't mean it.
- Yeah?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.597
Then what did you mean?

24:08.648 --> 24:12.268
I meant that you mean
a lot to me.

24:12.319 --> 24:13.836
You're kind of amazing.

24:28.952 --> 24:32.037
- Jack.
- What?

24:32.105 --> 24:34.657
What is that?

24:37.594 --> 24:40.679
I have no idea.

25:07.611 --> 25:11.998
♪ I see the moon,
the moon sees me, ♪

25:12.083 --> 25:19.506
♪ shining through
the old oak tree. ♪

25:19.590 --> 25:27.013
♪ Please let the light
that shines down on me ♪

25:27.098 --> 25:34.604
♪ shine down on the one
that I love. ♪

25:34.655 --> 25:38.808
That's you.

26:06.354 --> 26:07.971
Remember this?

26:08.022 --> 26:09.806
Yeah.

26:09.857 --> 26:11.908
That was my first commendation.

26:11.976 --> 26:15.111
Yeah, for dragging my ass
out of a Class 4 vortex.

26:16.314 --> 26:18.698
Well, you actually
owed me fifty bucks,

26:18.783 --> 26:21.117
so I was going for your wallet.

26:22.987 --> 26:25.021
Seems like a million years ago.

26:33.381 --> 26:36.333
You can't do this alone, Liv.

26:36.384 --> 26:38.752
Let me come with you.

26:38.836 --> 26:41.855
As much as I would love to
have you watching my butt,

26:41.922 --> 26:45.675
I need you here.

26:45.726 --> 26:46.977
Now if I'm not back tomorrow,

26:47.044 --> 26:48.544
you're gonna take Henry
to my mother's, right?

26:48.596 --> 26:50.814
- You're coming back.
- Yeah, but if I don't,

26:50.881 --> 26:53.883
I need to know that he's safe.

26:53.934 --> 26:57.420
You're the only one that I trust.

26:58.823 --> 27:00.974
You really think
Peter Bishop can stop this?

27:01.042 --> 27:05.228
That he can heal both worlds?

27:05.279 --> 27:06.696
I don't know,

27:06.747 --> 27:09.132
but if anyone can change
the Secretary's mind

27:09.200 --> 27:10.617
and get him to turn
that machine off,

27:10.701 --> 27:13.119
then it's his son, right?

27:15.289 --> 27:17.957
I'll see you when you get back.

27:24.181 --> 27:27.117
Okay.

27:32.973 --> 27:35.058
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

27:35.109 --> 27:36.943
<i>here at Ebbets Field,
bottom of the fifth.</i>

27:37.028 --> 27:38.761
<i>The Dodgers are leading
the Expos 2-0.</i>

27:38.813 --> 27:41.197
<i>Just yet to give up a hit.</i>

27:43.100 --> 27:47.737
Agent Dunham,
this is a restricted area.

27:49.673 --> 27:51.207
Ten months ago,

27:51.275 --> 27:54.244
the Secretary brought Peter Bishop
back from the other side.

27:54.311 --> 27:55.311
How?

27:57.114 --> 27:58.615
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:58.682 --> 28:00.250
Maybe if you just
put the gun down.

28:00.317 --> 28:03.453
Lie to me again and
I'll shoot you in the knee.

28:03.504 --> 28:04.721
I read the mission logs.

28:04.788 --> 28:07.040
I know that the Secretary
developed technology

28:07.108 --> 28:11.044
to cross between universes
and bring back Peter Bishop.

28:11.112 --> 28:14.164
Show me where it is.

28:14.231 --> 28:15.648
Now.

28:15.733 --> 28:17.934
The watch
commander patrols this area

28:17.985 --> 28:19.319
every five minutes.

28:19.403 --> 28:21.137
It's every twelve, actually.
Nice try.

28:21.188 --> 28:22.906
You realize this is never
going to work, right?

28:22.973 --> 28:24.324
I did not ask for your opinion.

28:24.408 --> 28:26.993
The technology you want never
made it out of the test phase

28:27.078 --> 28:29.028
because it breaks down
the molecular cohesion

28:29.113 --> 28:30.363
of the person crossing over.

28:30.448 --> 28:32.782
The Secretary took
a huge risk using it once.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.318
In some test subjects,
even that proved lethal.

28:35.369 --> 28:37.921
I appreciate your concern.
Now open the door.

28:45.963 --> 28:47.881
This stuff is not organized.

28:47.965 --> 28:51.667
You've got five seconds.
Four...

28:51.719 --> 28:53.219
Here it is.

29:08.452 --> 29:10.653
One will get you
there and back.

29:10.704 --> 29:12.071
If you make it
to the other side,

29:12.156 --> 29:13.773
just stay there,

29:13.841 --> 29:15.975
because when the Secretary
finds out you're a traitor--

29:16.043 --> 29:17.076
I'll take my chances.

29:28.556 --> 29:29.756
Stop!

29:36.213 --> 29:38.181
There she is!

29:38.232 --> 29:39.766
Put your hands up.

29:39.850 --> 29:41.935
Let's go!

29:47.525 --> 29:49.242
The other side!

29:52.446 --> 29:55.398
Suspect northeast tunnel.

29:57.034 --> 30:00.503
Hold your position!

30:05.192 --> 30:08.811
Show us your hands,
or we will fire on you.

30:08.863 --> 30:11.331
Son of a bitch.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.535
What do you want?

30:20.620 --> 30:22.671
FBI.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.673
Seamus Wiles,
now that you mention it,

30:24.757 --> 30:26.625
never struck me as an Irish.

30:26.676 --> 30:29.261
Sam Weiss, that makes sense.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.962
Well, he went by
a few different names,

30:31.013 --> 30:33.465
but only one of them rented
an apartment in Boston.

30:33.516 --> 30:35.500
You're not gonna
tell me what he did?

30:35.551 --> 30:37.719
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

30:37.804 --> 30:39.521
So long as there's
no dead bodies in there.

30:44.811 --> 30:46.695
What?
Did he move out?

30:46.763 --> 30:49.698
If he did, he didn't tell me.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.616
Last guy who bailed
on the apartment

30:51.684 --> 30:53.118
ended up being a hoarder.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.038
Took me three weeks
to clear out the trash.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.797
Here you go, sir.

31:14.056 --> 31:15.474
Do you really think
this could work?

31:15.541 --> 31:18.343
That Peter can
turn off the machine?

31:18.394 --> 31:21.146
The machine's emitting
an energy signature

31:21.213 --> 31:22.397
almost like
an electric current.

31:22.465 --> 31:25.567
Peter thinks that because of
his relationship with the machine,

31:25.651 --> 31:26.735
that if he goes into it,

31:26.819 --> 31:28.186
the current
will run through him,

31:28.237 --> 31:30.071
creating a kind of
a closed circuit.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.657
And if he can
complete the circuit,

31:32.725 --> 31:34.993
then he can also break it
or turn it off.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.578
What do you think?

31:36.662 --> 31:39.664
- Excuse me?
- Peter's your son.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.317
As a father,
do you think this is a good idea?

31:46.739 --> 31:50.008
It's because of my selfishness,

31:50.075 --> 31:53.411
my inability to let
my son go 26 years ago,

31:53.462 --> 31:56.014
that this is happening.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.583
My opinion as a father
doesn't matter.

31:58.634 --> 32:01.503
Walter, it matters to me.

32:08.144 --> 32:12.230
I honestly don't know
what's gonna happen, Phillip.

32:13.599 --> 32:18.770
And the current of energy
is so powerful.

32:18.821 --> 32:22.624
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen.

32:22.692 --> 32:27.045
And the thought of what
that could do to my son...

32:29.498 --> 32:32.250
I don't want him to suffer.

32:36.556 --> 32:39.724
You're all set, Mr. Bishop.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.627
Are you sure you don't
want me to call Olivia?

32:42.678 --> 32:44.629
If it doesn't work,

32:44.680 --> 32:46.214
she's gonna find out
soon enough.

32:51.487 --> 32:52.687
Just tell her that--

32:52.772 --> 32:57.158
Whatever it is,
you'll tell her yourself.

33:02.865 --> 33:05.000
Can I get you anything, son?

33:05.084 --> 33:07.452
A sedative?
Something to calm you?

33:07.503 --> 33:08.920
- I'm calm.
- You're sure now?

33:08.988 --> 33:10.822
I'm okay, Walter.

33:15.795 --> 33:18.046
The techs said they're ready
when you are, Peter.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.382
Good luck.

33:22.184 --> 33:25.704
If this works
and I save both universes,

33:25.771 --> 33:28.323
I want you to consider me
officially retired.

33:28.391 --> 33:31.175
I'll think about it.

33:40.820 --> 33:42.904
We'll be here waiting for you.

33:45.241 --> 33:48.576
Wait.
Give me your hands.

33:50.746 --> 33:52.330
What is that?

33:52.381 --> 33:55.533
Electro-conductive gel.

33:55.584 --> 33:58.320
If there's an energy current,

33:58.387 --> 33:59.754
it will pass through
the hand holds

33:59.839 --> 34:02.040
and this gel will keep it
from burning your skin.

34:02.091 --> 34:06.261
Walter...

34:06.345 --> 34:08.096
I'm okay.

34:13.985 --> 34:17.121
I was never good
at letting you go.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.858
This time, you have to.

34:27.783 --> 34:30.185
Son...

34:32.170 --> 34:33.672
I know.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.833
Peter!

35:51.917 --> 35:54.502
Male, 32 years of age,

35:54.587 --> 35:57.038
closed head trauma,
possible concussion, non-responsive.

35:57.123 --> 35:59.124
He suffered a massive
surge of electricity.

35:59.175 --> 36:01.209
- Vitals?
- Bp 80 over 50.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.326
Pulse 45, regular.

36:02.378 --> 36:04.212
- Gail, what's open?
- Trauma bay 2.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.930
His blood type is A-positive.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.832
Let's take him to 2.
We'll do an MRI.

36:07.883 --> 36:09.551
And you need to do
an echo-cardiogram as well.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.802
You have to wait here, sir.

36:10.853 --> 36:12.520
No, no, no, no, no.
You listen. No, no.

36:12.605 --> 36:15.173
You listen to me.

36:15.224 --> 36:16.891
This is my son.

36:16.976 --> 36:20.979
I understand, sir.
We'll take good care of him.

36:33.159 --> 36:34.409
Excuse me, Miss.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.327
This area's for staff
and immediate family only.

36:36.378 --> 36:37.796
I'm looking for Peter Bishop.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.047
He was brought in
about an hour ago.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.048
He's a white, 32--

36:40.132 --> 36:41.049
Olivia!
She's with us.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.500
How's Peter?

36:42.551 --> 36:45.587
He's still unconscious,
but his vitals are stable.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.539
They just--
They can't wake him up.

36:47.606 --> 36:48.940
He's with the doctors now.

36:49.008 --> 36:50.541
Oh, God.

36:50.593 --> 36:51.876
They did an MRI.

36:51.927 --> 36:54.378
They said that there is
no apparent brain trauma.

36:54.430 --> 36:56.815
They're just hoping that he's
gonna come out of it soon.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.650
What happened?

37:00.569 --> 37:01.986
Peter tried to go
into the machine.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.689
It wouldn't let him.

37:04.740 --> 37:08.943
It's like it's protecting
itself or something.

37:09.028 --> 37:12.080
- Is Walter here?
- Yeah.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.781
He's taking it pretty hard.

37:33.969 --> 37:37.972
I don't know my way
around here.

37:39.859 --> 37:44.779
Other people, I suppose,

37:44.864 --> 37:48.666
find comfort being in chapels,

37:48.734 --> 37:51.870
speaking to you.

37:59.712 --> 38:03.214
I have no other place to turn.

38:09.471 --> 38:11.956
I asked you for a sign,

38:12.007 --> 38:15.977
and you sent it to me.

38:16.045 --> 38:18.897
A white tulip.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.183
And I was so grateful.

38:22.268 --> 38:24.569
Since then,

38:24.636 --> 38:29.107
in moments of deep despair,

38:29.158 --> 38:35.363
I have found solace in believing
that you had forgiven me.

38:41.971 --> 38:45.924
I was willing to let him go.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.994
I was willing to let Peter die.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.881
I've changed.

38:56.018 --> 38:59.270
That should matter.

39:10.282 --> 39:17.121
God, I know my crimes
are unforgivable.

39:19.291 --> 39:22.377
So punish me.

39:22.461 --> 39:26.347
Do what you want to me.

39:26.415 --> 39:29.550
But I beg you,

39:29.635 --> 39:33.021
spare our world.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.852
Hello, Olivia.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.104
Sam, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.305
The machine is on.

40:24.390 --> 40:26.774
I know. And I need you
to take me to it.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.259
Sam, what is going on?

40:28.310 --> 40:31.696
Olivia, you have
to trust me now, please.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.148
We don't have a lot of time.

41:03.212 --> 41:05.063
I know this is hard for you.

41:11.070 --> 41:13.554
Oh, you don't know
anything about me.

41:13.622 --> 41:16.174
Don't I?

41:16.241 --> 41:17.575
This morning in my office,

41:17.643 --> 41:19.761
you asked how I could
be willing to let my son die

41:19.828 --> 41:21.028
to heal our world.

41:21.096 --> 41:25.616
But you understand sacrifice
better than anyone, Olivia.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.368
You were willing to
leave your son behind,

41:27.453 --> 41:28.619
to risk your life

41:28.670 --> 41:31.639
for what you perceived
to be the greater good.

41:31.707 --> 41:33.291
We're more alike
than you think.

41:33.358 --> 41:36.794
I don't understand how
killing billions of people

41:36.845 --> 41:39.714
could possibly be in the interest
of the greater good.

41:39.798 --> 41:43.134
That's because you still have
the luxury of your ideals.

41:43.185 --> 41:45.253
I have to be pragmatic.

41:48.957 --> 41:51.893
You've put me
in a difficult position.

41:51.977 --> 41:55.012
Anyone else would be rotting
away in a stockade for treason,

41:55.080 --> 41:58.232
but you are the mother
of my grandson.

41:58.317 --> 42:00.868
You'll stay here for your
own good until this is over.
