14:23.361 --> 14:26.819
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

14:26.931 --> 14:27.955
Yeah?

14:28.066 --> 14:29.931
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that... Four Leaf?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.367
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.097
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

14:34.205 --> 14:35.763
So now we in re-writes, right?

14:35.874 --> 14:37.000
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

14:37.108 --> 14:39.269
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

14:39.377 --> 14:41.345
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

14:41.446 --> 14:45.007
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

14:45.116 --> 14:46.708
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

14:46.818 --> 14:48.979
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

14:49.187 --> 14:51.155
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

14:51.256 --> 14:52.416
You're tangling me, God damn it!

14:52.557 --> 14:55.390
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

14:55.493 --> 14:57.290
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

14:57.762 --> 15:00.526
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

15:00.699 --> 15:03.224
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

15:03.334 --> 15:04.858
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

15:04.969 --> 15:05.993
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

15:06.104 --> 15:07.696
Get that fucking food...

15:07.806 --> 15:09.239
Here they come!

15:10.341 --> 15:12.741
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

15:12.844 --> 15:17.747
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

15:17.849 --> 15:20.818
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

15:20.919 --> 15:22.978
Let's go freaking Tet here!

15:23.088 --> 15:25.079
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

15:27.192 --> 15:28.784
That's my shit!

15:34.332 --> 15:37.267
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

15:45.143 --> 15:46.371
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

15:49.180 --> 15:51.444
<i>Bungle in the jungle.</i>

15:51.549 --> 15:54.643
More bad news from the Vietnamese set
of <i>Tropic Thunder,</i>

15:54.753 --> 15:58.484
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

15:58.590 --> 16:00.558
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

16:00.658 --> 16:03.320
<i>Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul</i>

<i>just five days into shooting.</i>
<i>The reason?</i>

16:09.601 --> 16:12.536
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien Cockburn,

16:12.637 --> 16:15.731
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

16:15.840 --> 16:20.539
<i>including flatulent star of the popular</i>
Fatties <i>franchise, Jeff Portnoy.</i>

16:20.645 --> 16:23.170
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>
<i>A lot of people are disrespecting me.</i>

16:23.281 --> 16:27.012
<i>They say that the movie's</i>
<i>just about farts. It's about family,</i>

16:27.118 --> 16:30.212
<i>and... you! You can't do what I do.</i>

16:30.321 --> 16:34.553
<i>Fresh from his most recent arrest</i>
<i>for heroin, glue and crack possession,</i>

16:34.659 --> 16:37.025
<i>Portnoy was almost uninsurable.</i>

16:37.128 --> 16:41.462
<i>Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking</i>
<i>hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.</i>

16:41.566 --> 16:44.057
<i>I'm so excited, you know what I'm</i>
<i>saying, about doing</i> Tropic Thunder.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.330
<i>Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.</i>
<i>Drink Booty Sweat.</i>

16:46.437 --> 16:48.098
<i>But the real heavyweight on the set</i>

16:48.206 --> 16:49.140

16:49.140 --> 16:50.903
<i>Is five-time Academy Award winner</i>
<i>Kirk Lazarus.</i>

16:51.009 --> 16:54.740
<i>The brilliant Australian</i>
<i>known for his bad boy antics off-screen</i>

16:54.846 --> 16:58.441
<i>is famous for his total immersion</i>
<i>into any role he portrays.</i>

16:58.550 --> 16:59.847
<i>Well, being an actor is no different</i>

16:59.951 --> 17:02.146
<i>than being a rugby player</i>
<i>or a construction worker,</i>

17:02.253 --> 17:03.379
<i>save for the fact that my tools</i>

17:03.488 --> 17:05.547
<i>are the mechanisms</i>
<i>that trigger human emotion.</i>

<i>Trying to hold his own onscreen</i>

<i>lately his</i> Scorcher <i>films</i>

<i>Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.</i>

17:28.646 --> 17:30.580
<i>You have no real family.</i>

17:30.682 --> 17:35.119
<i>You're on the wrong side of 40.</i>
<i>You're childless and alone.</i>

<i>Somebody close to you said,</i>

17:37.021 --> 17:39.819
<i>"One more flop and it's over."</i>

17:41.926 --> 17:44.019
<i>Somebody said they were close to me?</i>

17:44.963 --> 17:46.089
<i>It's been a tough year for Tugg.</i>

17:46.197 --> 17:48.961
<i>The disappointing buddy comedy</i>
Chitlin' & the Dude

17:49.067 --> 17:53.731
<i>was followed by an ill-advised venture</i>
<i>into serious dramatic territory.</i>

17:53.838 --> 17:54.930
Simple Jack,

17:55.039 --> 17:58.770
<i>the story of a mentally impaired</i>
<i>farmhand who can talk to animals,</i>

17:58.877 --> 18:00.742
<i>was a box office disaster</i>

18:00.845 --> 18:05.441
<i>that many critics called,</i>
<i>"One of the worst movies of all time."</i>

18:05.550 --> 18:09.179
<i>I ain't got a good brain.</i>

18:10.188 --> 18:13.089
<i>I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.</i>

18:13.191 --> 18:18.356
<i>You make me happy.</i>

18:19.898 --> 18:24.335
<i>But now the question is,</i>
<i>can Speedman make audiences happy</i>

18:24.435 --> 18:26.198
<i>in what's being called</i>
<i>the most expensive</i>

18:26.304 --> 18:28.568

<i>Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:34.609
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

18:34.712 --> 18:35.974
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

18:36.080 --> 18:37.638
guess who I'm staring at right now.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.410
<i>- What?</i>
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

18:39.517 --> 18:41.815
on the back cover
of <i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.354
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

18:44.455 --> 18:47.049
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

18:47.158 --> 18:49.752
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

18:49.861 --> 18:50.885
From Rick.

18:50.995 --> 18:53.088
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

18:53.197 --> 18:55.757
<i>All right,</i>
<i>that is a real satellite phone, bro.</i>

18:55.867 --> 18:57.459
Do not re-gift.

18:57.568 --> 19:00.059
Hey. You see
that <i>Access Hollywood</i> piece?

19:00.171 --> 19:03.106
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

19:03.207 --> 19:07.644
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

19:07.745 --> 19:09.212
But right now,

19:09.314 --> 19:10.872
<i>you're like that kid on the playground,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

19:10.982 --> 19:13.951
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

19:14.052 --> 19:16.043
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

19:16.154 --> 19:18.622
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

19:18.723 --> 19:20.054
What?

19:20.158 --> 19:22.023
How did the crying scene go?

19:22.126 --> 19:23.889
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

19:23.995 --> 19:27.158
<i>Then he starts drooling and dribbling,</i>
<i>and it wasn't even in the script...</i>

19:27.265 --> 19:28.357
Stop right there!

19:28.466 --> 19:30.195
<i>You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.</i>

19:30.301 --> 19:32.997
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

19:33.104 --> 19:36.471
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

19:36.574 --> 19:38.735
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

19:38.843 --> 19:40.208
<i>when you were a kid?</i>
<i>I mean, think of that.</i>

19:40.311 --> 19:44.077
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

19:44.182 --> 19:45.444
Good gosh.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.381
<i>- What?</i>
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

19:47.485 --> 19:49.749
<i>- No. The guy didn't come.</i>
- What?

19:49.854 --> 19:52.448
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

19:52.557 --> 19:54.457
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

19:54.559 --> 19:56.789
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

19:56.894 --> 19:59.021
<i>It is not okay, Tugg!</i>

19:59.130 --> 20:02.258
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

20:02.367 --> 20:06.303
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

20:06.404 --> 20:09.498
<i>I mean, I fought for that in your contract.</i>

20:09.607 --> 20:11.666
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

20:11.776 --> 20:13.801
Not too great.

20:17.048 --> 20:19.744
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

20:21.419 --> 20:23.717
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

20:23.821 --> 20:25.652
I'm stuck with mine.

20:27.558 --> 20:30.083
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

20:30.194 --> 20:33.061
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

20:33.164 --> 20:34.927
<i>Work on those tears, my man.</i>

20:35.033 --> 20:36.125
All right. Yeah.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.792
Say it for me one time.

20:37.902 --> 20:42.168
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

20:42.273 --> 20:43.865
<i>- I love you, buddy.</i>
- All right, bye.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.767
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

20:46.878 --> 20:48.539
I mean, are we in a crisis?

20:48.646 --> 20:50.170
He's the head of the studio.

20:50.281 --> 20:52.647
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

20:52.750 --> 20:53.842
He just wants a little face-time.

20:53.951 --> 20:56.545
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

20:56.654 --> 20:59.054
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

20:59.157 --> 21:03.560
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

21:03.661 --> 21:04.992
These are just words.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.189
Yeah! Yeah!

21:07.298 --> 21:10.597
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into Judi Dench.

21:10.701 --> 21:11.827
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

21:11.936 --> 21:14.404
<i>Look, he may be able to see me,</i>
<i>but I can't see him.</i>

21:14.505 --> 21:19.033
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
<i>- Get your ass out of my...</i>

21:19.143 --> 21:20.576
<i>- Your feet were on my desk.</i>
- Can he see us?

21:20.678 --> 21:22.009
I don't know why we don't have...

21:22.113 --> 21:24.274
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

21:24.382 --> 21:26.873
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

21:26.984 --> 21:28.383
- Hello, Les!
<i>- Okay.</i>

21:28.486 --> 21:30.545
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

21:30.655 --> 21:34.352
<i>I see you. I see you. I see you.</i>

21:34.459 --> 21:37.587
<i>Which one of you fuckfaces</i>
<i>is Damien Cockburn?</i>

21:38.596 --> 21:40.120
That's me, sir.

21:40.231 --> 21:43.758
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

21:43.868 --> 21:47.827
<i>And who here is the key grip?</i>
<i>You? You.</i>

21:49.841 --> 21:53.299
<i>Hit that director in the face,</i>
<i>really fucking hard.</i>

22:00.184 --> 22:01.515
Sorry, man.

22:08.025 --> 22:10.926
<i>This is your fault, you limey fuck!</i>

22:11.028 --> 22:12.893
<i>You shit the money-bed, my friend.</i>

22:12.997 --> 22:15.522
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

22:15.633 --> 22:18.727
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

22:18.836 --> 22:19.928
- What?
<i>- Fuck the jungle.</i>

22:20.037 --> 22:21.368
Exactly!

22:22.073 --> 22:23.540
Come on, man.

22:24.275 --> 22:27.005
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

22:27.111 --> 22:29.102
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas!

22:29.213 --> 22:32.705
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

22:32.817 --> 22:35.217
<i>You know how you handle an actor?</i>
<i>They whine about anything,</i>

22:35.319 --> 22:38.618
<i>you pull down their pants</i>
<i>and you spank their ass.</i>

22:38.723 --> 22:40.918
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

22:41.025 --> 22:44.791
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

22:45.663 --> 22:48.564
Fear makes him a man.

22:49.600 --> 22:54.196
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

22:54.305 --> 22:58.105
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.939
The real deep shit.

23:01.045 --> 23:02.547
You wanna make this movie right?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.639
You wanna make this movie right?

23:03.748 --> 23:07.240
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

23:08.819 --> 23:10.684
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

23:10.788 --> 23:12.688
Les, that's Four Leaf.

23:12.790 --> 23:16.089
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

23:18.296 --> 23:22.357
<i>You're a great American.</i>
<i>This nation owes you a huge debt.</i>

23:22.466 --> 23:25.435
<i>Now shut the fuck up</i>
<i>and let me do my job!</i>

23:26.304 --> 23:27.771
<i>- Look, Cockburn.</i>
- Yes.

23:27.872 --> 23:31.899
<i>From now on, my fist</i>
<i>is gonna be so far up your shithole</i>

23:32.009 --> 23:33.374
<i>that every time you have a thought,</i>

23:33.477 --> 23:36.503
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe</i>
<i>past my wedding ring.</i>

23:36.614 --> 23:40.141
<i>Take control of your actors,</i>
<i>or I will shut you down.</i>

23:40.251 --> 23:41.343
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

23:59.103 --> 24:01.298
One week down, two weeks behind,

24:01.405 --> 24:05.205
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

24:05.309 --> 24:06.708
Let's party!

24:07.645 --> 24:09.545
Man, you better get your shit straight,

24:09.647 --> 24:12.514
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

24:13.384 --> 24:14.351
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.977
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

24:17.355 --> 24:19.687
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. Cockburn.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.655
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

24:21.759 --> 24:23.056
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.354
You actually care, don't you?

24:24.462 --> 24:27.056
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

24:27.164 --> 24:29.132
I've spent the past two years of my life

24:29.233 --> 24:32.930
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

24:33.037 --> 24:34.197
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

24:34.305 --> 24:35.863
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

24:35.973 --> 24:37.634
Hey, hey, Alpa.

24:38.342 --> 24:40.810
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

24:40.911 --> 24:42.139
All right, hold up. Chino?

24:42.246 --> 24:44.009
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

24:44.949 --> 24:46.439
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

24:46.550 --> 24:47.574
No, it's about the film.

24:47.685 --> 24:49.676
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

24:50.054 --> 24:52.181
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

24:52.290 --> 24:55.748
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

24:58.029 --> 25:02.762
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

25:02.867 --> 25:04.459
Oh, right, right. I like you.

25:04.568 --> 25:06.536
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

25:06.637 --> 25:07.934
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.165
I'm really having a good time.

25:09.273 --> 25:10.900
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

25:11.008 --> 25:15.172
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

25:15.646 --> 25:18.046
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

25:19.150 --> 25:20.981
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

25:21.118 --> 25:22.483
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

25:22.586 --> 25:24.713
I'm gonna have V.C. Soldiers
in the video

25:24.822 --> 25:26.119
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

25:26.223 --> 25:30.592
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

25:30.828 --> 25:32.489
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to...

25:32.596 --> 25:35.588
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

25:35.733 --> 25:37.394
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

25:39.570 --> 25:40.730
Alpa!

25:40.838 --> 25:42.271
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

25:42.373 --> 25:43.340
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

25:43.441 --> 25:45.500
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

25:49.046 --> 25:51.378
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>

25:51.482 --> 25:54.349
<i>we see we're kind of the same.</i>

25:55.252 --> 25:58.779
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>
<i>we see</i>

26:00.458 --> 26:02.323
<i>we're kind of the same.</i>

26:03.094 --> 26:04.891
<i>Let's be friends.</i>

26:05.196 --> 26:07.824
<i>I know we can do great things together.</i>

26:09.934 --> 26:13.700
<i>That's a quotation from</i>
<i>a children's book I co-wrote,</i>

26:14.472 --> 26:16.599
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

26:16.707 --> 26:18.436
<i>I think it pertains to the journey...</i>

26:18.542 --> 26:19.873
<i>Simple Jack</i> sucked ass!

26:20.945 --> 26:23.345
<i>All right, who said that? It's not funny.</i>

26:23.447 --> 26:25.210
<i>Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?</i>

26:32.523 --> 26:35.219
When the herd loses its way,

26:35.326 --> 26:39.763
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.864
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

26:46.537 --> 26:48.027
- Sit down.
- Yes.

26:49.440 --> 26:54.537
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

26:59.583 --> 27:04.782
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

27:04.889 --> 27:09.223
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

27:16.033 --> 27:17.364
What?

27:17.601 --> 27:19.193
You're a riddle

27:20.704 --> 27:23.639
with no cheese to maze through.

27:25.543 --> 27:26.510
Don't you get it?

27:26.610 --> 27:30.341
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

27:30.448 --> 27:34.384
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

27:34.485 --> 27:37.921
and you are not going to fail me.

27:38.022 --> 27:41.617
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

27:41.725 --> 27:45.559
You must put those boys in the shit.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.221
What? I don't understand.

27:47.331 --> 27:50.596
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

27:50.701 --> 27:54.193
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

27:54.305 --> 27:57.934
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

27:58.042 --> 28:01.375
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

28:01.479 --> 28:06.348
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

28:06.450 --> 28:08.884
Then we take those boys up there,

28:08.986 --> 28:12.080
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

28:12.189 --> 28:15.124
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

28:15.226 --> 28:17.217
and screaming for their mammies.

28:17.328 --> 28:20.786
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

28:23.634 --> 28:25.158
I could do it.

28:25.936 --> 28:29.372
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

28:29.473 --> 28:32.806
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.002
Put them in the real shit.

28:34.111 --> 28:35.305
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

28:35.412 --> 28:38.472
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

28:38.582 --> 28:40.675
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

28:40.784 --> 28:42.547
Take them off the fucking grid!

29:00.004 --> 29:02.768
You are no longer actors in a movie!

29:03.874 --> 29:06.604
You are five men in a helicopter!

29:08.379 --> 29:10.142
With three other men!

29:15.786 --> 29:17.310
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

29:17.421 --> 29:21.482
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

29:21.592 --> 29:24.152
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

29:36.240 --> 29:37.502
M&M?

29:39.410 --> 29:40.707
M&M?

30:00.497 --> 30:02.633
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

30:02.633 --> 30:03.156
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

30:04.468 --> 30:07.631
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

30:07.738 --> 30:10.036
Get out, you wriggly worms!

30:10.140 --> 30:12.608
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

30:16.080 --> 30:17.809
See you in hell!

30:29.326 --> 30:33.524
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

30:34.798 --> 30:37.528
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

30:39.003 --> 30:41.233
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

30:41.338 --> 30:44.774
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

30:45.776 --> 30:49.371
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.243
Cell phones!

30:51.348 --> 30:52.815
What the hell, Damien?

30:52.916 --> 30:56.613
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

30:56.720 --> 31:00.121
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

31:00.224 --> 31:03.716
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

31:03.861 --> 31:06.159
And the good news.

31:06.263 --> 31:09.164
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

31:09.266 --> 31:13.032
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

31:13.137 --> 31:14.627
and liberate the POW camp,

31:14.738 --> 31:18.003
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

31:18.108 --> 31:19.905
at which point you will rescue him,

31:20.010 --> 31:23.377
at which point
we will chopper you home!

31:24.581 --> 31:25.673
Damn.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.580
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

31:27.685 --> 31:30.085
there's the map, this is the scene list.

31:30.187 --> 31:32.314
Think you can handle it?

31:32.423 --> 31:36.621
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

31:38.095 --> 31:41.724
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

31:41.832 --> 31:45.427
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

31:46.704 --> 31:49.867
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

31:49.973 --> 31:52.498
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

31:52.609 --> 31:54.201
You wanted to be actors.

31:54.311 --> 31:56.905
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

31:57.014 --> 32:00.006
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

32:00.117 --> 32:03.883
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

32:04.922 --> 32:09.621
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

32:09.727 --> 32:14.323
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

32:14.431 --> 32:18.868
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

32:18.969 --> 32:21.665
You are my chosen disciples.

32:21.772 --> 32:24.798
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

32:24.908 --> 32:27.934
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

32:28.045 --> 32:32.744
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

32:32.850 --> 32:35.182
- Yeah!
- All right!

32:53.937 --> 32:54.995
Yeah!

33:00.444 --> 33:01.502
Yeah!

33:14.057 --> 33:15.957
Not bad, Cockburn!

33:17.795 --> 33:18.989
Not bad.

33:20.697 --> 33:22.289
Wherever you are!

33:24.301 --> 33:27.361
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.073
Here we go.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.200
Must be an old French mine.

33:33.310 --> 33:36.768
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

33:38.849 --> 33:42.307
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

33:42.419 --> 33:44.444
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

33:44.555 --> 33:47.115
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

33:47.224 --> 33:50.250
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

33:54.264 --> 33:56.960
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

34:03.173 --> 34:06.074
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

34:06.176 --> 34:10.078
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

34:10.179 --> 34:11.579
And I think I can spot

34:13.684 --> 34:15.208
a prop head when I see one.

34:15.319 --> 34:16.809
Oh, Jesus.

34:18.021 --> 34:21.513
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

34:24.728 --> 34:27.856
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.091
Oh, God.

34:29.733 --> 34:32.860
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

34:32.969 --> 34:34.164
Oldest trick in the book.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.469
He getting down now.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.938
Oh, my God!

34:41.745 --> 34:43.804
Whoa, look at me!

34:43.914 --> 34:45.380
You're going to get the shots,

34:45.482 --> 34:48.474
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.712
I'm from London. I direct plays.

34:50.821 --> 34:53.847
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

35:03.867 --> 35:05.562
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

35:15.212 --> 35:17.612
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

35:17.714 --> 35:19.909
Blow some sense into these young men.

35:20.884 --> 35:23.785
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

35:23.887 --> 35:27.823
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

35:29.192 --> 35:32.684
<i>Tropic Thunder.</i>
Kind of like my <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

35:33.931 --> 35:36.161
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

35:36.266 --> 35:38.700
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

35:40.504 --> 35:42.734
<i>Driving Miss Daisy,</i> first studio gig.

35:43.507 --> 35:44.565
Yeah.

35:45.075 --> 35:47.873
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

35:47.978 --> 35:49.639
I don't know what it's called.

35:50.781 --> 35:55.514
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

35:58.655 --> 35:59.713
Okay.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.518
Damien, we're go for explosion.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.423
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

36:04.528 --> 36:06.257
Damien, we're go for explosion.

36:07.397 --> 36:08.421
<i>Do you copy?</i>

36:08.532 --> 36:11.399
<i>I got an itchy trigger finger here,</i>
<i>and I'm ready to blow some shit up.</i>

36:11.501 --> 36:15.130
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

36:15.238 --> 36:17.866
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

36:19.676 --> 36:20.768
Here. Okay.

36:20.877 --> 36:23.072
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

36:28.618 --> 36:30.552
"Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

36:30.654 --> 36:33.680
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

36:33.790 --> 36:36.350
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

36:37.694 --> 36:39.719
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

36:39.830 --> 36:41.320
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

36:41.431 --> 36:44.298
- I got... Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

36:44.401 --> 36:47.131
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

36:47.237 --> 36:49.068
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

36:49.172 --> 36:51.265
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

37:00.283 --> 37:03.150
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

37:04.488 --> 37:07.889
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

37:07.991 --> 37:09.822
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

37:09.926 --> 37:11.553
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

37:11.661 --> 37:14.357
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

37:14.464 --> 37:17.365
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

37:17.467 --> 37:20.698
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

37:20.804 --> 37:22.203
Zip it, Motown.

37:22.305 --> 37:23.863
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

37:23.974 --> 37:26.033
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.737
Man, I'm thirsty.

37:30.847 --> 37:35.807
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

37:36.686 --> 37:40.178
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

37:40.290 --> 37:42.087
Ain't no <i>Criss Angel Mindfreak,</i>

37:42.192 --> 37:45.525
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

37:45.629 --> 37:49.395
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

37:49.499 --> 37:52.832
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

37:53.804 --> 37:55.567
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:55.672 --> 37:57.469
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

37:57.574 --> 37:59.474
Then why are you still in character?

38:01.044 --> 38:03.012
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

38:04.147 --> 38:05.205
You don't know.

38:05.315 --> 38:08.250
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

38:11.021 --> 38:13.182
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

38:13.290 --> 38:15.019
Get down, fool!

38:16.726 --> 38:19.627
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

38:21.031 --> 38:24.694
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

38:35.312 --> 38:36.472
Yeah!

38:37.747 --> 38:39.112
Yeah!

38:41.718 --> 38:42.980
Eat lead!

38:44.955 --> 38:47.321
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.687
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

38:52.796 --> 38:54.286
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.191
Fuck you, Charlie!

39:01.271 --> 39:02.738
Big-ass titties!

39:08.712 --> 39:10.339
Look at that, huh?

39:15.619 --> 39:16.813
And cut!

39:19.089 --> 39:20.920
That's the trailer right there.

39:21.024 --> 39:22.321
Yeah!

39:22.425 --> 39:24.689
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

39:24.794 --> 39:26.318
North. Man said to head north.

39:26.429 --> 39:29.762
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

39:29.866 --> 39:30.924
I believed it.

39:31.034 --> 39:32.194
D'ang Kwook River.

39:32.836 --> 39:34.235
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

39:34.337 --> 39:37.067
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.940
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

39:41.611 --> 39:43.374
Real, baby, I'm real.

39:44.447 --> 39:47.245
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

39:48.385 --> 39:51.411
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

39:51.521 --> 39:53.352
Don't dawdle now!

40:17.480 --> 40:21.746
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

40:24.387 --> 40:27.686
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.487
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.204
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

40:42.806 --> 40:44.933
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... Nothing, man!

40:45.041 --> 40:48.374
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

40:48.478 --> 40:51.208
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

40:51.314 --> 40:52.406
They're mine.

40:52.515 --> 40:53.675
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

40:53.783 --> 40:55.478
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

40:55.585 --> 40:56.984
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

41:16.906 --> 41:19.602
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

41:19.709 --> 41:23.839
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

41:23.947 --> 41:25.847
It's gonna be tough,

41:25.949 --> 41:28.975
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.249
Just wish I had
a director like this on <i>Jack.</i>

41:32.355 --> 41:34.846
On <i>Jack.</i> What? <i>Jack?</i>
What you talking about?

41:36.059 --> 41:38.027
<i>- Simple Jack.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

41:39.529 --> 41:42.760
<i>Simple Jack,</i> yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

41:42.866 --> 41:45.130
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

41:45.235 --> 41:47.635
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

41:47.737 --> 41:50.638
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

41:51.341 --> 41:53.434
I just did the work.

41:53.543 --> 41:57.343
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

41:58.648 --> 42:00.809
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

42:00.917 --> 42:02.680
Then again,
I always found mere observation

42:02.786 --> 42:05.084
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

42:05.188 --> 42:08.248
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

42:08.358 --> 42:12.692
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.855
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

42:14.964 --> 42:17.694
You know, there were times
when I was doing <i>Jack</i>

42:17.801 --> 42:20.269
that I actually felt retarded,

42:20.370 --> 42:21.735
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

42:21.838 --> 42:24.033
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

42:24.140 --> 42:25.937
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

42:26.042 --> 42:29.273
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

42:29.379 --> 42:32.348
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.007
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

42:34.117 --> 42:36.847
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

42:36.953 --> 42:38.318
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

42:38.421 --> 42:41.288
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

42:41.391 --> 42:42.551
When I was playing the character.

42:42.659 --> 42:45.253
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

42:45.362 --> 42:47.557
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

42:47.664 --> 42:48.926
Trying to come back from that.

42:49.032 --> 42:53.162
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

42:53.269 --> 42:56.238
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

42:56.339 --> 42:58.068
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

42:58.174 --> 43:02.702
"Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

43:02.812 --> 43:04.871
- It's just like... Right?
- Yeah.

43:04.981 --> 43:07.745
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

43:07.851 --> 43:09.716
Yeah.

43:09.819 --> 43:12.117
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

43:12.222 --> 43:13.519
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

43:13.623 --> 43:16.490
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

43:16.593 --> 43:19.084
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

43:19.195 --> 43:20.822
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

43:20.930 --> 43:24.457
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

43:24.567 --> 43:26.592
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

43:26.703 --> 43:28.500
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:28.605 --> 43:29.867
Hats off for going there,

43:29.973 --> 43:32.703
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

43:36.413 --> 43:39.940
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

43:42.152 --> 43:44.177
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

43:45.722 --> 43:47.815
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

43:47.957 --> 43:52.053
Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man,</i> looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

43:52.162 --> 43:56.258
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

43:57.133 --> 43:58.998
Then you got Tom Hanks,
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

43:59.102 --> 44:01.400
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

44:01.504 --> 44:04.405
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

44:04.507 --> 44:05.531
That ain't retarded.

44:05.675 --> 44:09.611
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

44:11.548 --> 44:13.539
You went full retard, man.

44:15.084 --> 44:16.449
Never go full retard.

44:17.454 --> 44:21.015
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, <i>I Am Sam.</i>

44:21.124 --> 44:24.423
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

44:34.270 --> 44:37.467
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

44:38.141 --> 44:40.837
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

44:40.944 --> 44:42.206
No, that's impossible, man.

44:42.312 --> 44:45.179
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

44:45.315 --> 44:46.839
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

44:46.950 --> 44:48.178
Yeah, this isn't me.

44:48.284 --> 44:51.082
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

44:51.187 --> 44:53.883
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

44:53.990 --> 44:56.185
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

44:56.292 --> 44:58.522
- We're in a... We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

44:58.628 --> 45:00.095
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

45:00.196 --> 45:01.857
What happened to,
"No man left behind," okay?

45:01.965 --> 45:04.229
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

45:04.334 --> 45:07.064
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

45:07.170 --> 45:10.469
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on <i>Freaky Friday,</i> okay?

45:10.573 --> 45:11.904
This shit will fucking ruin me!

45:12.008 --> 45:13.908
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

45:14.010 --> 45:16.478
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

45:19.849 --> 45:21.783
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

45:32.161 --> 45:34.857
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

45:34.964 --> 45:37.831
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

45:37.967 --> 45:38.934
This thing's too heavy.

45:39.035 --> 45:40.468
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

45:40.570 --> 45:42.834
Where's the fucking prop guy?

45:47.810 --> 45:50.404
How's it going with that map, chief?

45:50.513 --> 45:53.107
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

45:53.216 --> 45:54.774
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

45:54.884 --> 45:56.374
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

45:56.486 --> 45:58.113
- Yeah.
- Okay.

45:58.221 --> 46:00.746
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

46:00.890 --> 46:01.857
Thank you.

46:01.991 --> 46:03.549
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.218
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

46:05.328 --> 46:07.091
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

46:07.196 --> 46:09.061
Is your character dyslexic?

46:09.165 --> 46:10.894
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.831
I'm tired, I want to go home.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.461
Why, so you can get back and make
<i>Fatties: Fart 20,</i> or some shit?

46:15.572 --> 46:18.507
It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two,</i> there's no... Hey,
you wish you had a <i>Fatties</i> franchise.

46:18.608 --> 46:19.836
- What?
- It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two.</i>

46:19.943 --> 46:21.171
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no <i>Fatties</i> franchise,

46:21.277 --> 46:23.677
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.247
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

46:25.348 --> 46:26.474
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

46:26.583 --> 46:28.414
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

46:28.518 --> 46:30.543
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

46:30.653 --> 46:31.677
...my farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

46:31.788 --> 46:34.348
You still got that shit upside down.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.357
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

46:36.459 --> 46:38.689
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.353
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

46:40.463 --> 46:41.896
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

46:41.998 --> 46:45.161
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

46:45.268 --> 46:47.634
All right. That's enough.

46:49.105 --> 46:52.836
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.934
So take a chow break. Chow break!

46:57.747 --> 46:59.305
But stay alert.

46:59.882 --> 47:03.374
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

47:08.458 --> 47:11.393
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

47:11.494 --> 47:12.859
"Lost in the goddamn jungle."

47:12.962 --> 47:13.929
Captain Simple Jack.

47:14.931 --> 47:15.693
Fuck you.

47:24.841 --> 47:26.399
I fucking hate movies.

47:28.745 --> 47:31.578
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

47:41.424 --> 47:44.188
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

47:44.293 --> 47:48.957
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

47:49.065 --> 47:52.330
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

47:55.772 --> 47:58.707
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

47:59.676 --> 48:01.974
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

48:04.080 --> 48:07.106
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

48:08.518 --> 48:10.748
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

48:10.853 --> 48:12.480
Bait, I need bait.

48:13.623 --> 48:17.320
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

48:17.427 --> 48:18.655
Yeah, I think so.

48:18.761 --> 48:21.457
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

48:21.564 --> 48:25.364
making <i>Planet of the Apes</i> on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

48:25.468 --> 48:27.936
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

48:28.738 --> 48:30.433
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

48:30.540 --> 48:33.703
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

48:34.110 --> 48:36.271
Trying to get home, man.

48:36.379 --> 48:38.040
Got a big job coming up next year.

48:38.147 --> 48:39.580
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

48:39.682 --> 48:42.207
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

48:42.318 --> 48:43.410
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

48:43.519 --> 48:46.010
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

48:46.122 --> 48:47.589
Slap a beard on you.

48:47.690 --> 48:49.715
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

48:49.826 --> 48:51.817
- Kevin Sandusky.
- Yeah.

48:52.495 --> 48:56.056
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

48:56.466 --> 48:59.993
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

49:03.673 --> 49:06.107
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

49:06.209 --> 49:08.734
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

49:09.445 --> 49:12.005
Why are they even out in the daytime?

49:14.217 --> 49:18.654
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

49:24.894 --> 49:28.660
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

49:30.867 --> 49:32.596
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

49:32.702 --> 49:34.533
and I think he's getting cold feet.

49:35.838 --> 49:38.636
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

49:38.741 --> 49:40.368
and rehearsal.

49:41.410 --> 49:43.935
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

49:44.046 --> 49:45.104
Good.

49:46.682 --> 49:49.549
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

49:49.652 --> 49:51.813
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

49:51.921 --> 49:55.152
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

49:55.258 --> 49:58.955
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

49:59.061 --> 50:03.259
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

50:03.366 --> 50:06.995
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

50:12.909 --> 50:15.002
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

50:16.179 --> 50:17.407
You O.D.'d!

50:18.981 --> 50:20.312
Hold up now, Jeff.

50:22.718 --> 50:24.117
Fucking hell!

50:25.755 --> 50:28.815
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

50:28.925 --> 50:31.393
I don't have any more jellybeans.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.797
You land there!

50:54.717 --> 50:57.117
Wow. Look at these ruins.

50:59.288 --> 51:03.725
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

51:03.826 --> 51:06.192
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

51:06.295 --> 51:08.490
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

51:08.598 --> 51:13.695
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

51:13.803 --> 51:16.237
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

51:16.339 --> 51:18.407
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

51:18.574 --> 51:20.166
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

51:20.276 --> 51:22.301
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

51:22.411 --> 51:24.811
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

51:24.914 --> 51:28.782
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

51:28.885 --> 51:31.012
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.678
I don't believe you people.

51:34.423 --> 51:36.118
What do you mean "you people"?

51:38.794 --> 51:41.388
What do you mean, "you people"?

51:41.497 --> 51:43.488
I think what Tugg means is...

51:43.599 --> 51:44.964
No, look at his eyes, man.

51:45.067 --> 51:47.797
...you people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

51:47.904 --> 51:49.428
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

51:49.538 --> 51:51.506
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

51:52.541 --> 51:55.203
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

51:56.712 --> 51:59.909
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.308
- "Viet Cong"!
- What?

52:02.818 --> 52:05.844
It's "Viet Cong." There's no "S."
It's already plural.

52:05.955 --> 52:07.547
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

52:08.925 --> 52:11.359
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

52:11.460 --> 52:14.258
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

52:14.363 --> 52:16.888
Hey, man, you know how in <i>Rambo I,</i>
he was big but a little puffy

52:16.999 --> 52:18.591
and then <i>Rambo II,</i>
he got all shredded up?

52:18.701 --> 52:21.568
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

52:21.671 --> 52:23.229
- Yeah?
- Not <i>Rambo I but II.</i>

52:23.339 --> 52:25.068
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

52:25.174 --> 52:27.540
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

52:27.643 --> 52:30.339
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

52:30.446 --> 52:31.936
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

52:32.048 --> 52:33.413
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

52:33.516 --> 52:36.508
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... It's tough.

52:36.619 --> 52:38.109
- You look good.
- Any tips?

52:38.220 --> 52:39.915
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

52:40.022 --> 52:41.148
There's, like, the pineapple...

52:41.257 --> 52:43.555
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

52:43.659 --> 52:45.251
- Hey!
- All right, now!

52:45.361 --> 52:47.795
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

52:47.897 --> 52:49.888
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

52:50.300 --> 52:52.234
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

52:54.070 --> 52:55.332
We're going the wrong way!

52:55.438 --> 52:56.530
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

52:56.640 --> 53:01.100
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

53:01.211 --> 53:04.112
and instead we did this.

53:04.214 --> 53:07.843
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

53:07.951 --> 53:10.476
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

53:11.421 --> 53:12.820
This is not cool!

53:15.525 --> 53:16.651
Maybe.

53:18.094 --> 53:19.584
This is insane!

53:20.864 --> 53:23.196
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.195
We're supposed to be a unit!

53:26.303 --> 53:27.827
Suck my unit!

53:28.705 --> 53:30.502
All right, fine.

53:30.607 --> 53:35.510
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.603
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

53:37.714 --> 53:39.511
Yes, I do!

53:39.616 --> 53:44.144
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

53:44.254 --> 53:48.714
"Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

53:48.825 --> 53:50.759
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

54:04.341 --> 54:07.333
Come on, men. Let's get home.

54:45.515 --> 54:50.179
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.389
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

54:54.491 --> 54:56.220
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

54:56.326 --> 54:59.727
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

54:59.829 --> 55:00.921
People thought it would come down to

55:01.030 --> 55:03.294
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.200
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

55:07.303 --> 55:09.032
Now, whichever format porno backs

55:09.139 --> 55:12.973
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

55:13.076 --> 55:16.068
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

55:16.179 --> 55:17.908
You talking to me this whole time?

55:18.648 --> 55:19.945
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

55:20.049 --> 55:21.516
Jesus Christ, man!

55:39.936 --> 55:41.995
Booty Sweat.

55:48.044 --> 55:49.443
Oh, God!

55:51.681 --> 55:56.243
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

55:56.352 --> 55:58.547
You want my flak jacket?

55:58.655 --> 56:02.523
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

56:02.625 --> 56:05.458
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

56:05.562 --> 56:07.462
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

56:07.564 --> 56:09.532
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

56:09.632 --> 56:12.760
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.360
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

56:15.472 --> 56:17.770
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.273
You know,
back before the war broked out,

56:19.375 --> 56:22.105
I was a saucier in San Antone.

56:22.212 --> 56:24.840
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

56:24.948 --> 56:29.248
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

56:29.352 --> 56:33.379
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

56:34.724 --> 56:35.986
Hell, yeah!

56:36.092 --> 56:40.290
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

56:40.396 --> 56:45.629
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

56:45.735 --> 56:50.604
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

56:54.844 --> 56:57.244
I get excited about my foods, man.

58:22.865 --> 58:25.299
Die!

58:39.215 --> 58:41.308
No!

58:47.857 --> 58:52.157
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

58:52.261 --> 58:54.661
I have no idea.

58:54.764 --> 58:57.324
I've never been outside the States.

58:57.433 --> 58:59.594
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

58:59.702 --> 59:01.693
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

59:01.804 --> 59:03.169
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

59:03.272 --> 59:05.934
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

59:06.042 --> 59:07.942
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

59:08.044 --> 59:10.740
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

59:10.847 --> 59:14.578
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. Of A.

59:14.684 --> 59:17.346
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

59:17.453 --> 59:19.512
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

59:19.622 --> 59:21.317
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

59:21.424 --> 59:24.689
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

59:24.794 --> 59:26.227
God, and to think I believed in you!

59:26.329 --> 59:28.695
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

59:28.798 --> 59:30.925
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

59:52.243 --> 59:54.074
<i>- Rick?</i>
- Tugg.

59:54.178 --> 59:56.237
I killed one, Rick.

59:57.381 --> 59:59.781
The thing I love most in the world.

59:59.883 --> 01:00:01.714
Vivica, get off the line now!

01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.421
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:08.582
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:09.852
Get your hands on some bleach,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.326
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:13.919
No, a panda.

01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:15.794
<i>I killed a panda.</i>

01:00:15.899 --> 01:00:17.696
Amanda? Come on, dude.

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:19.826
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:21.598
No, a panda!

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.070
A panda?

01:00:23.173 --> 01:00:25.767
A sweet, cuddly,

01:00:25.876 --> 01:00:27.810
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

01:00:27.945 --> 01:00:30.880
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:32.141
It's beautiful here.

01:00:32.249 --> 01:00:33.739
<i>You on the set?</i>

01:00:33.851 --> 01:00:35.113
I am the set.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:38.188
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

01:00:38.289 --> 01:00:39.517
Screw TiVo.

01:00:39.623 --> 01:00:42.091
I'm way beyond TiVo.

01:00:42.192 --> 01:00:44.285
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

01:00:44.395 --> 01:00:47.694
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:49.629
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:53.936
I've moved on.

01:00:54.672 --> 01:00:56.401
Where have you moved on to?

01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:57.997
<i>Another agency?</i>

01:00:59.543 --> 01:01:01.067
Who's with you?

01:01:01.178 --> 01:01:03.339
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

01:01:03.447 --> 01:01:07.543
<i>You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!</i>
<i>I am getting the TiVo!</i>

01:01:07.651 --> 01:01:09.846
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

01:01:09.953 --> 01:01:11.011
<i>Tugg?</i>

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:15.622
Please don't fire me.

01:01:16.493 --> 01:01:17.687
I did it, I did it!

01:01:17.795 --> 01:01:20.127
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:23.097
<i>- Two and a Half Men</i> taping.
- Shit.

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:25.125
Cancel it.

01:01:25.235 --> 01:01:26.896
And get me Tugg's <i>Tropic Thunder</i>
contract.

01:01:27.004 --> 01:01:30.132
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.207
Okay.

01:01:34.812 --> 01:01:37.713
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

01:01:37.848 --> 01:01:39.907
He doesn't look too good.

01:01:40.017 --> 01:01:45.045
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

01:01:45.155 --> 01:01:47.282
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:48.483
No, don't!

01:01:48.592 --> 01:01:51.117
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

01:01:51.228 --> 01:01:53.594
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

01:01:53.697 --> 01:01:55.631
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

01:01:55.733 --> 01:01:57.633
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

01:01:57.735 --> 01:01:59.396
Did you need another revenue stream?

01:01:59.503 --> 01:02:02.301
For your information,
my revenue stream

01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:04.738
currently generates $2 million a year

01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:06.776
in charitable contributions
for my community.

01:02:06.877 --> 01:02:09.209
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:11.645
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

01:02:11.749 --> 01:02:13.546
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.709
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:20.882
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:23.118
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

01:02:23.227 --> 01:02:24.353
That shit ain't funny.

01:02:24.461 --> 01:02:27.157
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

01:02:27.264 --> 01:02:28.822
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

01:02:28.932 --> 01:02:30.661
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

01:02:30.768 --> 01:02:33.236
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

01:02:33.337 --> 01:02:35.999
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:37.164
You know what? Fuck that, man!

01:02:37.274 --> 01:02:39.936
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:46.239
For 400 years,

01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:50.185
that word has kept us down.

01:02:51.255 --> 01:02:52.882
What the fuck?

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:56.756
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.761
Now we up in the big leagues,

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.626
getting our turn at bat.

01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:04.394
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

01:03:05.068 --> 01:03:08.401
That's the theme song for
<i>The Jeffersons.</i> You really need help.

01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:11.633
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

01:03:11.742 --> 01:03:13.676
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

01:03:13.777 --> 01:03:17.213
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

01:03:17.314 --> 01:03:19.908
Guys! Hey, guys!

01:03:20.517 --> 01:03:22.985
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

01:03:25.355 --> 01:03:28.188
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:32.491
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

01:03:33.464 --> 01:03:36.763
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:41.736
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.898
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

01:03:45.275 --> 01:03:46.572
We got ground to cover!

01:04:15.572 --> 01:04:18.837
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

01:04:19.743 --> 01:04:21.472
Bring it on, Cockburn!

01:04:29.553 --> 01:04:31.987
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:33.886
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:36.789
like, <i>Adventures of Ford Fairlane,</i>
you know,

01:04:36.894 --> 01:04:40.523
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

01:04:40.631 --> 01:04:43.065
And <i>Cliffhanger.</i>
<i>Cliffhanger's</i> incredible.

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:46.624
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

01:04:46.737 --> 01:04:48.898
it's absolutely amazing.

01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:50.906
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:55.546 --> 01:04:57.207
Who send you here?

01:04:57.314 --> 01:05:01.944
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

01:05:02.686 --> 01:05:08.090
Serial number 694529987.

01:05:11.895 --> 01:05:14.887
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.761
a little easier.

01:05:20.537 --> 01:05:22.630
My leader's not quite as cordial.

01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:28.976
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:32.606
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, Sergeant,

01:05:32.749 --> 01:05:37.709
United States Army, 694529987.

01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:44.084
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

01:05:49.733 --> 01:05:52.099
Dude, you all right?

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:53.635
Man you totally leaned into that.

01:05:53.737 --> 01:05:56.797
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

01:05:56.907 --> 01:05:59.102
Hey, it was an accident, man.

01:06:01.645 --> 01:06:03.579
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.272
- Let's go.
- Get up.

01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:06.974
I rather rot in your V.C. Jail!

01:06:07.084 --> 01:06:10.952
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.079
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:14.953
let's do the tea part, okay?

01:06:16.493 --> 01:06:17.926
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

01:06:18.261 --> 01:06:20.058
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

01:06:20.163 --> 01:06:23.291
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.300
My belly really hurts, you guys!

01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:27.597
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

01:06:27.704 --> 01:06:29.934
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.701
All right. All right.

01:06:36.279 --> 01:06:38.270
Are you okay, Jeff?

01:06:38.382 --> 01:06:39.747
I'm awesome.

01:06:42.152 --> 01:06:43.619
Holy shit!

01:06:48.158 --> 01:06:50.319
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

01:06:55.032 --> 01:06:56.522
Man. Now I'm tripping.

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:59.261
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

01:07:00.137 --> 01:07:01.832
Speedman was right?

01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:03.303
I don't think so.

01:07:03.407 --> 01:07:05.637
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

01:07:07.244 --> 01:07:09.337
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:11.573
We were in that chopper for hours.

01:07:11.682 --> 01:07:13.946
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:16.485
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

01:07:16.586 --> 01:07:19.350
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:21.014
What the fuck is Laos?

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.284
It's the Golden Triangle.

01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:24.360
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:26.429
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:30.557
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:33.192
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle,
dumbass.

01:07:33.303 --> 01:07:35.669
This is the Golden Triangle.

01:07:35.772 --> 01:07:37.330
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:38.738
How do you know that?

01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:41.572
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.677
Cut!

01:07:44.781 --> 01:07:46.248
Oh, Jesus!

01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:48.840
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

01:07:48.952 --> 01:07:50.317
Damien, cut!

01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:53.681
Hey, Damien, cut!

01:07:54.524 --> 01:07:56.185
They got Speedman.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.193
And it doesn't look good.

01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:32.158
I am Tran.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.291
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.328
You are D.E.A. Scum!

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:44.707
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

01:08:51.014 --> 01:08:52.504
Do you want to die?

01:08:53.283 --> 01:08:54.750
- Do you?
- No!

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:58.981
Please, don't hurt me!

01:09:06.863 --> 01:09:08.057
Say that again.

01:09:09.064 --> 01:09:10.862
Please, don't hurt me.

01:09:10.966 --> 01:09:14.060
No! Like you did before! Say it!

01:09:15.037 --> 01:09:16.027
Say it!

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:20.131
Please, don't hurt me!

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:38.353
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:43.196
You saw <i>Simple Jack?</i>

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.631
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

01:09:47.337 --> 01:09:49.167
We do not have many luxury here.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:51.706
And <i>Simple Jack</i> is the only movie
we possess.

01:09:51.808 --> 01:09:55.642
You got the VHS.

01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:57.804
We've watched it many, many times.

01:09:57.914 --> 01:10:00.382
You should've got Oscar.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.183
Well, you know. It's...

01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:07.718
Just to be nominated...

01:10:07.824 --> 01:10:09.052
You were nominated?

01:10:09.159 --> 01:10:10.683
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:13.957
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

01:10:14.064 --> 01:10:16.430
It's just... It's very political.
You have to take out ads...

01:10:16.533 --> 01:10:19.024
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:21.599
So, are you going to

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.867
let me go, or...

01:10:24.975 --> 01:10:27.102
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:29.007
Much more money now!

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:41.579
He's in a meeting.

01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:44.455
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:47.360
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

01:10:47.464 --> 01:10:50.126
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:51.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:53.703 --> 01:10:55.603
What do you need, Peck?

01:10:55.705 --> 01:10:58.333
No, more like what do you need, Les?

01:10:58.441 --> 01:10:59.635
Glasses?

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:01.768
What?

01:11:01.878 --> 01:11:04.369
So you can read
the <i>Tropic Thunder</i> contract

01:11:04.481 --> 01:11:06.881
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

01:11:06.983 --> 01:11:10.714
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

01:11:11.488 --> 01:11:13.615
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

01:11:15.258 --> 01:11:18.091
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:21.254
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.389
No, not you, Helen.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.197
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

01:11:27.304 --> 01:11:28.828
Perfect.

01:11:28.939 --> 01:11:31.373
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

01:11:31.474 --> 01:11:33.339
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

01:11:33.443 --> 01:11:36.606
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:39.011
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:42.207
We are Flaming Dragon.

01:11:42.319 --> 01:11:44.685
Speedman is with us now.

01:11:44.788 --> 01:11:48.349
<i>For 50 million, you will get him back.</i>

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:50.619
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:53.423
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.430
Simple Jack belong to us now.

01:11:58.168 --> 01:12:00.193
He does, does he?

01:12:00.303 --> 01:12:02.771
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:05.306
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:07.376
But if you think
you can poach my client...

01:12:07.477 --> 01:12:12.005
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

01:12:12.115 --> 01:12:13.605
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

01:12:13.717 --> 01:12:16.015
This is Flaming Dragon!

01:12:16.119 --> 01:12:18.883
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

01:12:18.989 --> 01:12:23.824
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

01:12:25.195 --> 01:12:27.925
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

01:12:28.031 --> 01:12:30.499
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.897
<i>So whatever you're thinking,</i>
<i>you better think again.</i>

01:12:32.002 --> 01:12:33.367
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna</i>
<i>have to head down there,</i>

01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:36.837
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.567
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

01:12:38.675 --> 01:12:42.702
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

01:12:42.812 --> 01:12:45.406
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

01:12:45.515 --> 01:12:47.278
I will massacre you!

01:12:47.384 --> 01:12:49.318
I will fuck you up!

01:12:57.127 --> 01:12:58.856
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:34.297 --> 01:13:37.289
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.129
Okay.

01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:41.897
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

01:13:44.974 --> 01:13:46.601
Put teeth in!

01:13:53.716 --> 01:13:55.581
Now do movie.

01:13:55.685 --> 01:13:57.346
The whole movie?

01:13:57.454 --> 01:13:59.115
I can't. I don't know the whole...

01:13:59.222 --> 01:14:01.713
You perform! You perform or die!

01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:03.949
Monkey swine!

01:14:06.863 --> 01:14:08.262
Pa.

01:14:10.233 --> 01:14:11.598
More stupid!

01:14:13.369 --> 01:14:18.432
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

01:14:20.877 --> 01:14:22.208
You saw what I saw.

01:14:22.312 --> 01:14:24.906
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

01:14:25.014 --> 01:14:27.380
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

01:14:27.484 --> 01:14:28.815
which is in the other direction!

01:14:28.918 --> 01:14:30.510
Ain't right.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.645
What would've happened
in <i>The Great Escape</i>

01:14:32.755 --> 01:14:36.589
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

01:14:36.693 --> 01:14:40.686
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

01:14:40.797 --> 01:14:43.425
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

01:14:43.533 --> 01:14:44.727
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:48.736
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

01:14:48.838 --> 01:14:52.968
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

01:14:56.179 --> 01:14:58.670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:14:58.781 --> 01:15:01.841
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:03.919
Crazy's better than nothing.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.979
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:11.424
<i>- Sex Camp.</i> Remember it?
- Yeah.

01:15:11.528 --> 01:15:15.487
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:18.123
had to break into the rich girl camp.

01:15:18.234 --> 01:15:19.929
So, what we did,

01:15:20.036 --> 01:15:23.028
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

01:15:23.139 --> 01:15:26.700
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

01:15:32.315 --> 01:15:33.680
Look,

01:15:33.783 --> 01:15:35.842
you guys, we already know the plan.

01:15:35.952 --> 01:15:37.920
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:42.390
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:44.892
The book of <i>Tropic Thunder.</i>

01:15:44.994 --> 01:15:47.224
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:51.159
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

01:15:51.935 --> 01:15:55.063
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:56.229
Cool.

01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:00.768
You guys all read the script, right?

01:16:00.877 --> 01:16:02.970
I don't read the script, script reads me.

01:16:04.147 --> 01:16:05.614
What the hell does that even mean?

01:16:05.715 --> 01:16:09.082
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

01:16:12.422 --> 01:16:14.253
All right. The Wet Offensive.

01:16:15.291 --> 01:16:17.727
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

01:16:17.727 --> 01:16:18.193
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

01:16:18.294 --> 01:16:20.626
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:23.130
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:26.059
Yeah!

01:16:27.136 --> 01:16:30.128
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.574
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:37.441
Some of us
might not even make it back.

01:16:37.547 --> 01:16:40.641
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:46.117
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

01:16:46.222 --> 01:16:48.053
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:53.653
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

01:16:55.164 --> 01:16:57.029
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:01.964
Okay.

01:17:03.273 --> 01:17:06.367
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

01:17:06.476 --> 01:17:09.570
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:12.910
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

01:17:13.016 --> 01:17:15.951
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

01:17:16.052 --> 01:17:17.781
Peck! We have it handled.

01:17:17.887 --> 01:17:20.378
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:22.481
I got it. Got it.

01:17:34.604 --> 01:17:36.834
- Les Grossman.
<i>- We not get money yet.</i>

01:17:37.373 --> 01:17:39.500
Price now 100 million!

01:17:39.609 --> 01:17:42.442
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

01:17:42.545 --> 01:17:45.605
Great. Let me get this down.

01:17:45.715 --> 01:17:47.148
100 million.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:49.718
Wait! I got a better idea.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.351
Instead of 100 million,

01:17:52.455 --> 01:17:55.322
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:57.723
<i>Then you kill him! Do your thing!</i>
<i>Skin the fucking bastard!</i>

01:17:57.827 --> 01:18:00.022
Go to town, man! Go to town!

01:18:00.129 --> 01:18:02.290
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

01:18:02.398 --> 01:18:04.059
go fuck yourself!

01:18:05.168 --> 01:18:07.728
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

01:18:09.839 --> 01:18:12.569
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

01:18:12.675 --> 01:18:14.506
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

01:18:14.610 --> 01:18:16.475
They're gonna kill him!

01:18:19.549 --> 01:18:20.607
And?

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:24.078
"And?"

01:18:25.455 --> 01:18:29.482
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:34.991
We'll weep for him, in the press.

01:18:35.131 --> 01:18:37.793
Set up a scholarship in his name.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.836
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

01:18:41.938 --> 01:18:43.428
we file an insurance claim.

01:18:43.539 --> 01:18:46.337
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

01:18:46.442 --> 01:18:50.173
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:54.044
You can't be serious.

01:18:55.284 --> 01:18:56.842
You kick in the door to my house,

01:18:56.953 --> 01:19:02.414
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

01:19:02.525 --> 01:19:07.121
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:09.596
and you're asking if I'm serious?

01:19:13.469 --> 01:19:15.164
Let's face it.

01:19:15.271 --> 01:19:19.298
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:23.702
Speedman is a dying star,

01:19:23.813 --> 01:19:27.044
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.880
That's physics. It's inevitable.

01:19:29.986 --> 01:19:33.319
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

01:19:33.423 --> 01:19:37.257
The universe is talking to us right now.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.918
You just gotta listen.

01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:55.636
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

01:19:55.745 --> 01:19:56.837
Yeah.

01:19:56.946 --> 01:20:00.109
Ask and you shall receive.

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:05.280
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:08.755
I know you want the goodies.

01:20:08.858 --> 01:20:10.849
Welcome to the goody room.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.590
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

01:20:15.698 --> 01:20:16.960
That's how you're gonna roll.

01:20:17.066 --> 01:20:21.025
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

01:20:21.137 --> 01:20:22.434
Yeah!

01:20:22.939 --> 01:20:24.201
Playa.

01:20:25.074 --> 01:20:26.405
Playa!

01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:28.740
Big dick playa.

01:20:28.845 --> 01:20:30.836
Swinging past your knees!

01:20:30.947 --> 01:20:31.971
Big dick, baby.

01:20:32.081 --> 01:20:33.275
Yep.

01:20:36.619 --> 01:20:39.213
Or you can grow a conscience

01:20:39.322 --> 01:20:41.688
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

01:20:46.662 --> 01:20:48.755
Let me get this straight.

01:20:48.865 --> 01:20:52.494
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:53.967
one of my best friends,

01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:58.700
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

01:20:59.842 --> 01:21:00.968
Yes.

01:21:06.048 --> 01:21:08.312
A G5 airplane?

01:21:10.419 --> 01:21:11.477
Yes.

01:21:12.555 --> 01:21:15.251
And lots of money.

01:21:16.626 --> 01:21:18.787
Playa.

01:21:21.697 --> 01:21:22.891
Yeah!

01:21:24.133 --> 01:21:26.727
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

01:21:29.305 --> 01:21:31.967
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

01:21:32.808 --> 01:21:36.539
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

01:21:36.646 --> 01:21:38.170
Sorry, Jack.

01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:40.545
She in heaven now.

01:21:41.317 --> 01:21:44.582
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

01:21:44.687 --> 01:21:47.815
She sleep forever.

01:21:47.924 --> 01:21:51.052
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.755
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

01:21:54.864 --> 01:21:58.664
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

01:21:58.768 --> 01:21:59.894
He'll become a naturalist.

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:01.697
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

01:22:01.804 --> 01:22:03.533
then the...

01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:07.835
Told you I'd tag you back.

01:22:10.513 --> 01:22:12.777
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

01:22:12.882 --> 01:22:15.180
for any offense I might've caused, man?

01:22:15.284 --> 01:22:17.650
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

01:22:17.753 --> 01:22:19.152
I guess so.

01:22:19.255 --> 01:22:21.951
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

01:22:22.058 --> 01:22:23.355
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

01:22:23.459 --> 01:22:25.654
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

01:22:25.761 --> 01:22:27.695
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

01:22:29.298 --> 01:22:31.095
But are we cool?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.531
Not really.

01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:37.931
Hey, man.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.735
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

01:22:39.842 --> 01:22:41.867
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

01:22:41.978 --> 01:22:44.845
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

01:22:44.947 --> 01:22:46.574
Watch the stuff.

01:22:46.682 --> 01:22:48.707
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

01:22:48.818 --> 01:22:50.718
We need you, Jeff.

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.412
What are you talking about?

01:22:52.521 --> 01:22:54.079
Okay, look, man.

01:22:55.324 --> 01:22:57.622
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

01:22:59.862 --> 01:23:02.592
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

01:23:02.698 --> 01:23:05.792
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

01:23:06.702 --> 01:23:09.500
- They were drugs.
- Really?

01:23:09.605 --> 01:23:13.974
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:17.011
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

01:23:20.316 --> 01:23:24.480
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

01:23:25.855 --> 01:23:29.621
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

01:23:29.725 --> 01:23:32.592
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

01:23:32.695 --> 01:23:34.253
until it is out of my system.

01:23:34.363 --> 01:23:35.990
I'm gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:37.656
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

01:23:37.767 --> 01:23:40.964
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:42.401
You got it!

01:23:43.072 --> 01:23:45.131
Goodbye, Mama!

01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:48.369
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

01:23:48.477 --> 01:23:53.437
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:58.979
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:11.261
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:15.933
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

01:24:16.072 --> 01:24:18.939
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:21.236
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

01:24:21.343 --> 01:24:22.742
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

01:24:22.845 --> 01:24:23.869
Hell, yeah.

01:24:23.979 --> 01:24:27.312
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

01:24:27.416 --> 01:24:30.112
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

01:25:02.118 --> 01:25:04.348
It's a little twig man Oscar.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.360
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

01:25:15.064 --> 01:25:17.032
And you can call me

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.397
Papa.

01:25:42.892 --> 01:25:44.621
Wow, look at all those stars.

01:25:46.595 --> 01:25:48.563
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

01:25:50.099 --> 01:25:52.659
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

01:25:53.636 --> 01:25:55.103
Man, that's beauty.

01:25:57.039 --> 01:26:00.099
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

01:26:00.209 --> 01:26:02.507
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

01:26:04.346 --> 01:26:05.472
Don't ignore me!

01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:08.448
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:11.644
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

01:26:11.754 --> 01:26:14.587
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:16.089
'Cause I think she's hot.

01:26:16.192 --> 01:26:19.559
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

01:26:19.662 --> 01:26:23.655
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

01:26:24.733 --> 01:26:26.064
Funny, huh?

01:26:26.168 --> 01:26:29.069
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

01:26:30.306 --> 01:26:33.207
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:37.069
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

01:26:37.179 --> 01:26:39.477
Hey, Radar? Evans?

01:26:39.582 --> 01:26:40.640
No, it's Kevin.

01:26:40.749 --> 01:26:42.478
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

01:26:42.585 --> 01:26:44.815
I didn't tell you, but <i>Fatties: Fart Three</i>
is coming down the pike,

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.412
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

01:26:48.524 --> 01:26:51.084
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

01:26:51.193 --> 01:26:53.161
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

01:26:53.262 --> 01:26:54.593
Jesus, man.

01:26:55.631 --> 01:26:57.098
Hey, man.

01:26:57.199 --> 01:27:00.100
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

01:27:00.202 --> 01:27:03.603
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

01:27:03.706 --> 01:27:05.401
How about you, man?

01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:07.975
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

01:27:08.077 --> 01:27:09.544
Me?

01:27:09.645 --> 01:27:12.409
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

01:27:13.249 --> 01:27:16.912
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

01:27:17.019 --> 01:27:19.419
but that's not gonna happen.

01:27:20.289 --> 01:27:21.756
What about you, Masterblaster?

01:27:21.857 --> 01:27:24.485
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

01:27:24.593 --> 01:27:29.326
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

01:27:29.431 --> 01:27:30.659
No. You missing me, man.

01:27:30.766 --> 01:27:32.563
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

01:27:32.668 --> 01:27:33.862
How about it?

01:27:34.637 --> 01:27:35.763
Yeah.

01:27:37.172 --> 01:27:39.140
Yeah, there is.

01:27:39.241 --> 01:27:42.574
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

01:27:42.678 --> 01:27:44.578
No. I mean...

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.515
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

01:27:49.618 --> 01:27:51.313
It's... It's complicated.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.854
No! It's simple as pie, man.

01:27:53.956 --> 01:27:56.550
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

01:27:56.659 --> 01:28:00.288
"Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

01:28:00.396 --> 01:28:03.092
- What's her name?
- Lance.

01:28:03.198 --> 01:28:04.961
"Listen here, Lance..."

01:28:05.834 --> 01:28:09.634
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

01:28:09.738 --> 01:28:11.467
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

01:28:11.573 --> 01:28:13.507
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

01:28:13.609 --> 01:28:15.770
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

01:28:15.878 --> 01:28:17.402
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

01:28:17.513 --> 01:28:19.174
I love the pussy! All right?

01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:21.181
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

01:28:21.317 --> 01:28:22.648
When you wrote <i>I Love Tha Pussy</i>

01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:26.118
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:28.587
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

01:28:28.691 --> 01:28:31.626
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

01:28:31.727 --> 01:28:32.751
This Hollywood.

01:28:32.861 --> 01:28:33.919
How about we all get back to work?

01:28:34.029 --> 01:28:35.690
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

01:28:35.798 --> 01:28:38.699
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:46.105
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

01:28:46.208 --> 01:28:49.439
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

01:28:50.813 --> 01:28:53.646
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

01:28:53.749 --> 01:28:56.843
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

01:28:56.952 --> 01:28:59.011
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

01:29:05.594 --> 01:29:06.652
Okay, so, what's the plan?

01:29:06.762 --> 01:29:08.161
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

01:29:08.263 --> 01:29:10.026
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

01:29:10.132 --> 01:29:11.827
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

01:29:11.934 --> 01:29:13.492
How the hell do you know Chinese?

01:29:13.602 --> 01:29:17.060
<i>Land of Silk and Money</i> with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

01:29:17.172 --> 01:29:21.131
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

01:29:21.243 --> 01:29:23.177
That might be our ride.

01:29:39.928 --> 01:29:41.156
The straps are too tight!

01:29:41.263 --> 01:29:43.629
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

01:30:11.527 --> 01:30:14.496
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

01:30:14.596 --> 01:30:15.563
Fuck you!

01:30:23.072 --> 01:30:25.973
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

01:31:20.028 --> 01:31:22.724
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

01:31:27.236 --> 01:31:29.500
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

01:31:39.648 --> 01:31:40.842
Okay.

01:31:43.051 --> 01:31:44.609
All right.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.120
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

01:31:47.222 --> 01:31:49.281
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

01:32:07.176 --> 01:32:10.873
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

01:32:10.979 --> 01:32:12.105
Oh, fuck!

01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:29.221
Get over here!

01:32:30.599 --> 01:32:32.157
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

01:32:32.267 --> 01:32:34.667
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:37.261
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

01:32:37.372 --> 01:32:40.569
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

01:32:40.676 --> 01:32:42.234
Sweet. Thank God.

01:32:42.344 --> 01:32:44.539
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:15.302
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:16.672
I can give y'all a diversion.

01:33:16.778 --> 01:33:20.714
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:04.658
Yes, your farm.

01:34:09.031 --> 01:34:11.431
Where is your farm,

01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:14.468
American?

01:34:17.306 --> 01:34:18.568
My farm?

01:34:20.509 --> 01:34:21.771
Oh, shit.

01:34:22.544 --> 01:34:25.741
Here's my motherfucking farm!

01:34:25.847 --> 01:34:27.337
Yeah!

01:34:32.287 --> 01:34:35.279
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:37.485
Kwan-Lo!

01:34:38.994 --> 01:34:40.894
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

01:34:41.396 --> 01:34:42.556
Yeah!

01:34:44.132 --> 01:34:47.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

01:34:47.436 --> 01:34:49.700
Keep your head down on the ground!

01:34:49.805 --> 01:34:51.966
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

01:34:52.074 --> 01:34:55.510
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:58.238
Now show me where the drugs are.

01:34:58.347 --> 01:35:00.144
What the fuck?

01:35:00.248 --> 01:35:01.943
That ain't the plan!

01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:03.745
Don't judge me!

01:35:07.422 --> 01:35:09.185
He's got a real serious problem.

01:35:09.991 --> 01:35:12.255
Hey! Hey, you!

01:35:12.361 --> 01:35:14.556
Take off your clothes!

01:35:14.663 --> 01:35:16.324
Take off your clothes!

01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:17.728
What do we do now?

01:35:17.833 --> 01:35:19.664
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

01:35:19.768 --> 01:35:22.168
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:25.637
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

01:35:25.741 --> 01:35:27.641
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

01:35:27.743 --> 01:35:30.234
- Door!
- One, two, three!

01:35:43.525 --> 01:35:45.356
I go high, you go low.

01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:53.599
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

01:35:53.702 --> 01:35:57.001
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

01:35:58.573 --> 01:36:00.006
Come on, come on!

01:36:00.108 --> 01:36:02.099
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

01:36:02.778 --> 01:36:04.336
Here.

01:36:04.446 --> 01:36:06.548
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

01:36:06.548 --> 01:36:06.843
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

01:36:06.948 --> 01:36:09.542
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

01:36:09.651 --> 01:36:13.178
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

01:36:13.288 --> 01:36:16.155
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

01:36:16.258 --> 01:36:17.987
I can still see you.

01:36:24.132 --> 01:36:25.224
Tugg!

01:36:27.769 --> 01:36:28.929
Tugg?

01:36:31.006 --> 01:36:32.200
Gotcha.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:36.276
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

01:36:36.378 --> 01:36:37.504
Home?

01:36:39.648 --> 01:36:43.482
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

01:36:43.585 --> 01:36:46.145
Don't you get it? I already am home.

01:36:48.457 --> 01:36:51.585
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

01:36:51.693 --> 01:36:53.888
My son gave this to me.

01:36:53.995 --> 01:36:57.487
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

01:36:57.599 --> 01:36:59.430
Does he wanna come with us?

01:37:20.422 --> 01:37:22.549
Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:37:22.657 --> 01:37:27.617
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

01:37:27.729 --> 01:37:30.197
<i>I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah</i>

01:37:30.298 --> 01:37:31.424
They're not your demo, dude.

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.300
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

01:37:34.402 --> 01:37:37.599
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

01:37:37.706 --> 01:37:44.111
Like him in <i>Carlito's Way?</i>

01:37:44.479 --> 01:37:47.141
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

01:37:47.249 --> 01:37:49.183
What're you sayin'? Huh?

01:37:49.284 --> 01:37:53.846
<i>Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

01:37:54.222 --> 01:37:57.055
<i>Cruising. Sea of Love.</i>

01:37:57.158 --> 01:38:00.150
Real Al Pacino.

01:38:00.262 --> 01:38:03.857
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

01:38:03.965 --> 01:38:07.025
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

01:38:07.135 --> 01:38:08.534
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

01:38:08.637 --> 01:38:10.935
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

01:38:15.577 --> 01:38:17.977
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:54.143
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

01:38:54.249 --> 01:38:55.876
a Hanoi high-five.

01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:09.895
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

01:39:10.665 --> 01:39:11.893
Smoke!

01:39:17.739 --> 01:39:19.434
Oh, shit!

01:39:24.279 --> 01:39:25.803
Jeff, don't!

01:39:26.648 --> 01:39:28.639
It doesn't matter what I do.

01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:31.719
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.813
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

01:39:35.924 --> 01:39:38.154
They only laugh at my farts.

01:39:38.259 --> 01:39:40.250
Jeff, we really need to go now!

01:39:40.362 --> 01:39:41.954
This is all I deserve!

01:40:02.117 --> 01:40:04.347
Laugh at that, you bastards!

01:40:04.452 --> 01:40:07.853
Hilarious! Hilarious!

01:40:09.391 --> 01:40:12.224
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:30.102
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:33.146
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

01:40:36.084 --> 01:40:38.951
There. All right, you keep six right here.

01:40:40.889 --> 01:40:43.050
Come on, let's go.

01:40:43.158 --> 01:40:45.092
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

01:40:45.193 --> 01:40:46.854
He's on tilt status.

01:40:46.961 --> 01:40:50.920
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in <i>Moonshot.</i>

01:40:51.032 --> 01:40:53.125
They found me in an alley in Burbank

01:40:53.234 --> 01:40:56.465
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

01:40:57.205 --> 01:40:58.263
What're you talking about?

01:40:58.373 --> 01:41:00.739
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

01:41:00.842 --> 01:41:05.279
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

01:41:11.186 --> 01:41:13.416
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

01:41:13.521 --> 01:41:16.957
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

01:41:18.193 --> 01:41:20.093
All right. Give me your hooks.

01:41:20.195 --> 01:41:21.822
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:24.763
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

01:41:24.866 --> 01:41:27.027
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

01:41:31.973 --> 01:41:34.134
Shit! Enough!

01:41:34.242 --> 01:41:36.142
Fake shit!

01:41:39.247 --> 01:41:40.373
Fuck!

01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:51.252
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

01:41:51.359 --> 01:41:53.452
I'll take care of these yahoos!

01:41:55.497 --> 01:41:57.761
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

01:41:57.866 --> 01:41:59.993
- "It's me, Tugg!"
- It's me, Tugg.

01:42:00.101 --> 01:42:01.568
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:04.467
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

01:42:04.572 --> 01:42:06.267
I know who I am!

01:42:06.374 --> 01:42:10.105
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:11.269
What?

01:42:11.379 --> 01:42:13.472
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

01:42:13.581 --> 01:42:16.277
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

01:42:16.384 --> 01:42:17.646
and claims to know what dude he is...

01:42:17.752 --> 01:42:19.515
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

01:42:19.621 --> 01:42:20.713
...by playing other dudes?

01:42:20.822 --> 01:42:22.016
I know what dude I am!

01:42:22.123 --> 01:42:24.921
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

01:42:25.026 --> 01:42:26.288
Or scared of who?

01:42:26.394 --> 01:42:28.988
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

01:42:29.097 --> 01:42:30.359
Scared of you.

01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:37.602
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

01:42:37.705 --> 01:42:39.229
The dudes are emerging.

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:40.671
He's right, you know.

01:42:42.443 --> 01:42:43.842
I am not

01:42:45.413 --> 01:42:47.108
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

01:42:51.519 --> 01:42:52.986
We gotta roll out.

01:42:53.087 --> 01:42:56.318
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.495
Or Neil Armstrong.

01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:11.231
I think I might be nobody.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.800
Wow!

01:43:13.908 --> 01:43:16.570
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

01:43:17.846 --> 01:43:20.815
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

01:43:20.915 --> 01:43:23.475
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

01:43:23.585 --> 01:43:25.746
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

01:43:25.854 --> 01:43:27.685
I memorized every single monologue

01:43:27.789 --> 01:43:30.383
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:32.516
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

01:43:32.627 --> 01:43:35.061
I saw <i>Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.</i>

01:43:35.163 --> 01:43:38.132
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

01:43:38.233 --> 01:43:41.361
Yeah, man, <i>Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!</i>

01:43:41.469 --> 01:43:45.599
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

01:43:45.707 --> 01:43:48.699
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

01:43:53.047 --> 01:43:55.038
I'm a rooster illusion.

01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:56.343
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

01:43:56.451 --> 01:43:59.614
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

01:44:02.156 --> 01:44:03.953
Come on, come on, come on.

01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:09.663
Bingo! Move out.

01:44:11.599 --> 01:44:12.964
Oh, God.

01:44:14.936 --> 01:44:17.803
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

01:44:22.377 --> 01:44:23.844
Gotta hold on!

01:44:30.018 --> 01:44:31.383
Four Leaf!

01:44:36.124 --> 01:44:37.455
You grew hands?

01:44:46.701 --> 01:44:48.225
RPG, gentlemen!

01:44:51.005 --> 01:44:52.529
Where are you going?

01:44:58.046 --> 01:45:00.571
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

01:45:22.603 --> 01:45:23.934
My ass!

01:45:27.175 --> 01:45:28.506
My ass!

01:45:30.111 --> 01:45:33.376
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

01:45:33.481 --> 01:45:35.711
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

01:45:35.817 --> 01:45:40.117
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

01:45:40.221 --> 01:45:41.688
It's Sandusky.

01:45:43.558 --> 01:45:46.857
- Kevin Sandusky.
- That's my name.

01:45:46.961 --> 01:45:48.553
You remembered my name.

01:45:48.663 --> 01:45:50.688
Alpa, go help Cody.

01:45:50.798 --> 01:45:52.789
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.731
- I got him!
- Let's go!

01:45:56.170 --> 01:45:57.694
Let's get out of here!

01:46:09.584 --> 01:46:11.074
Hey, Leaf!

01:46:11.185 --> 01:46:12.413
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.509
Hit the plunger

01:46:13.621 --> 01:46:14.815
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:22.495
Come on! Get in the chopper!

01:46:22.697 --> 01:46:25.495
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

01:46:30.038 --> 01:46:31.665
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

01:46:31.773 --> 01:46:33.570
Are you the special effects guy?

01:46:33.674 --> 01:46:35.801
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:37.404
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

01:46:37.512 --> 01:46:40.106
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

01:46:40.214 --> 01:46:41.704
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

01:46:41.816 --> 01:46:44.341
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

01:46:44.452 --> 01:46:46.943
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

01:46:47.055 --> 01:46:49.853
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

01:46:49.957 --> 01:46:53.791
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

01:46:53.895 --> 01:46:55.453
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

01:46:55.563 --> 01:46:57.793
He's my son. He's my boy!

01:46:57.899 --> 01:47:00.333
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

01:47:03.471 --> 01:47:05.132
You tell the world what happened here.

01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:07.070
What happened here?

01:47:07.175 --> 01:47:09.405
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

01:47:11.779 --> 01:47:13.610
I got this.

01:47:13.714 --> 01:47:14.874
Tugg!

01:47:15.583 --> 01:47:19.144
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

01:47:20.555 --> 01:47:24.150
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

01:47:24.258 --> 01:47:26.886
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

01:47:26.994 --> 01:47:28.188
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

01:47:28.296 --> 01:47:30.423
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

01:47:31.499 --> 01:47:32.625
- Come on!
- Get in!

01:47:32.733 --> 01:47:34.360
- Come on!
- He's staying?

01:47:34.469 --> 01:47:36.733
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

01:47:41.309 --> 01:47:45.803
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

01:47:51.652 --> 01:47:53.051
I got this.

01:47:53.721 --> 01:47:55.154
Leaf, no!

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.928
It's over! He's gone!

01:48:42.036 --> 01:48:44.095
Cody! We gotta go!

01:48:46.107 --> 01:48:47.301
Look.

01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:11.262
Think he's done.

01:49:11.365 --> 01:49:12.593
Cover me!

01:49:13.668 --> 01:49:16.603
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

01:49:16.704 --> 01:49:18.433
How do we cover him?

01:49:22.677 --> 01:49:26.078
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.774
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

01:49:28.883 --> 01:49:30.874
I can't feel my legs.

01:49:30.985 --> 01:49:33.920
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

01:49:34.021 --> 01:49:35.215
- No worries.
- Good.

01:49:35.323 --> 01:49:36.620
Come on, we gotta split, man.

01:49:36.724 --> 01:49:39.022
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

01:49:39.126 --> 01:49:41.458
Hey! I want you to know something.

01:49:41.562 --> 01:49:42.756
What?

01:49:43.931 --> 01:49:45.728
I know who you are.

01:49:47.835 --> 01:49:49.598
You're my friend.

01:49:51.872 --> 01:49:53.499
You're my brother.

01:49:54.375 --> 01:49:57.208
But like a really cool brother, you know?

01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:58.676
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

01:49:58.779 --> 01:50:01.612
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

01:50:01.716 --> 01:50:02.705
Really?

01:50:02.817 --> 01:50:04.307
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

01:50:04.418 --> 01:50:05.885
Jesus, let's go, man!

01:50:05.987 --> 01:50:07.088
All right?

01:50:07.088 --> 01:50:07.452
All right?

01:50:09.023 --> 01:50:10.456
Upsy-daisy.

01:50:12.226 --> 01:50:15.218
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:50:17.365 --> 01:50:18.662
Get in! Get in!

01:50:18.766 --> 01:50:20.791
Come on! Here we go!

01:50:23.337 --> 01:50:26.135
Tuggernuts! I got it!

01:50:28.509 --> 01:50:30.807
- Tugger!
- Rick!

01:50:33.414 --> 01:50:34.642
What the fuck?

01:50:34.749 --> 01:50:36.376
I got the TiVo!

01:50:37.285 --> 01:50:41.688
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

01:50:46.861 --> 01:50:48.123
Oh, shit!

01:51:24.965 --> 01:51:26.990
<i>And the Oscar goes to...</i>

01:51:29.737 --> 01:51:32.035
<i>Yes! Tugg Speedman.</i>

01:51:33.674 --> 01:51:36.370
"Tropic Blunder,
The True Story Behind the Making

01:51:36.477 --> 01:51:39.002
"of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever."

01:51:40.581 --> 01:51:41.707
Yeah!

01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.320
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

01:52:07.641 --> 01:52:12.010
Eight Oscars, $400 million

01:52:12.113 --> 01:52:15.344
and you saved
Tugg Speedman's career.

01:52:15.449 --> 01:52:18.316
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

01:52:20.354 --> 01:52:21.446
Really?

01:52:21.555 --> 01:52:23.546
No, dickhead, of course I could.

01:52:23.657 --> 01:52:26.319
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

01:52:26.427 --> 01:52:29.328
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:32.126
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

01:52:32.233 --> 01:52:33.598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:35.896
Very... Okay, there he is.

01:52:36.003 --> 01:52:37.493
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

01:52:37.605 --> 01:52:39.129
All right. We're having a...

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.640
Fuck, okay. Thank you, Les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

01:52:41.742 --> 01:52:44.142
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

01:52:44.245 --> 01:52:45.974
Good. Thank you, sir.
