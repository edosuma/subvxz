WEBVTT

00:00.707 --> 00:02.930
(Both moaning)

00:03.117 --> 00:04.817
That is how you have sex, America.

00:04.852 --> 00:06.819
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:06.854 --> 00:08.855
What's happening here is amazing.

00:08.889 --> 00:11.924
Like, I want to film it,
but I don't want to film it

00:11.959 --> 00:13.455
'cause that would be porn.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.780
And that time,
I think I figured out

00:15.815 --> 00:18.558
what that thing
underneath the thing was.

00:18.634 --> 00:20.835
- Yeah, you did.
- And whoa, right?

00:20.869 --> 00:22.203
Yeah, whoa.

00:22.237 --> 00:25.106
Hey, should we take a break
and, like, talk about our childhoods

00:25.140 --> 00:27.374
or something?
You know, get in there,

00:27.409 --> 00:30.277
get into it,
get into each other's heads.

00:30.312 --> 00:33.047
Dreams, thoughts, fears, feelings.

00:33.081 --> 00:34.381
If... Yeah... I mean...

00:34.416 --> 00:36.250
- (Groans)
- No?

00:36.284 --> 00:37.351
I'm gonna throw a curveball.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.386
I'm gonna go banana it

00:39.421 --> 00:41.122
and then I'll be ready for round two.

00:41.156 --> 00:43.424
Define "banana it."

00:43.458 --> 00:44.558
Eat a banana?

00:44.593 --> 00:45.893
(Laughing):
Oh, good.

00:45.927 --> 00:48.496
I was worried for a second.

00:48.530 --> 00:51.365
What are Nick and Jess
doing in there,

00:51.399 --> 00:52.566
and how is it this loud?

00:52.601 --> 00:55.836
Nick's body is so soft,
it should absorb sound.

00:55.871 --> 00:58.572
They're just getting warmed up, Schmidt.
It's a whole new ball game around here.

00:58.607 --> 01:01.475
You, see, you wouldn't know that
'cause you haven't been here in weeks,

01:01.510 --> 01:04.211
but now that you're single,
yeah, you got to deal with this, too.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.013
Dumped by two women in
the same day, Schmidt,

01:06.047 --> 01:07.548
that has got to be a record, man.

01:07.582 --> 01:09.250
I get it, all right?
I lost two perfect women,

01:09.284 --> 01:11.385
but I'm fine with it, all right?
I'm fine.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.987
You could've been perfectly happy
with either one of them,

01:13.021 --> 01:15.823
- but now you're by yourself.
- Winston, I'm fine. Please.

01:15.857 --> 01:17.424
- That really has to hurt.
- This is my home, too.

01:17.459 --> 01:18.993
I shouldn't have to be faced
with their stupid,

01:19.027 --> 01:20.828
happy relationship everywhere I look.

01:20.862 --> 01:24.131
This is going to stop, Winston,

01:24.166 --> 01:26.000
and I'm gonna stop it.

01:26.034 --> 01:28.169
Well, my advice to you is
to stay in your foxhole,

01:28.203 --> 01:31.038
keep your head down and
invest in one of these babies.

01:31.072 --> 01:33.107
Watch your butt, Furguson.

01:33.141 --> 01:35.843
This is my survival kit.
Check this out, man.

01:35.877 --> 01:37.578
Blindfold.

01:37.612 --> 01:40.915
Get this bell wrapped around my neck
so he can hear when I'm coming.

01:40.949 --> 01:42.183
Every couple has a weakness.
Kate and Will,

01:42.217 --> 01:43.817
I could break them up with one e-mail.

01:43.852 --> 01:45.219
Oh, look at that,
look at the royal baby now,

01:45.253 --> 01:47.855
- living with slutty Aunt Pippa.
- I'm telling you, they're bulletproof.

01:47.889 --> 01:50.090
(Laughter)

01:50.125 --> 01:53.894
Um, I have to show Nick
something in the bathroom.

01:53.929 --> 01:55.529
Yeah, it's tiles.

01:55.564 --> 01:57.398
(Giggling)

01:57.432 --> 01:59.266
I'm so bad at lying.

01:59.301 --> 02:01.268
It's for sex.

02:01.303 --> 02:03.137
Oh, go! Go make love
in our communal shower.

02:03.171 --> 02:06.507
Enjoy it now, you little bunnies.

02:06.541 --> 02:08.142
What?

02:08.175 --> 02:10.176
Want to see a magic trick?

02:12.347 --> 02:15.186
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪

02:15.196 --> 02:16.835
♪ Who's that girl? ♪

02:16.852 --> 02:18.552
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪
♪ It's Jess ♪

02:20.422 --> 02:22.489
I like your chewing face.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.292
It's just food.
Yeah, that's all it is, okay, people?

02:25.327 --> 02:27.428
I know it's super annoying
to be around a couple.

02:27.462 --> 02:28.896
Not me at all. It's him.

02:28.930 --> 02:30.598
- Who? Oh.
- (Meowing)

02:30.632 --> 02:32.233
Look at him.

02:32.267 --> 02:36.503
Yeah, we had a tough day today
at the V-E-T.

02:36.538 --> 02:38.105
Yeah, they said he's gonna have to get...

02:38.139 --> 02:39.607
It rhymes with "fleutered."

02:39.641 --> 02:41.475
The word is neutered.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.876
Cats don't speak English.

02:42.911 --> 02:45.887
Furguson's never gonna experience
actual, physical lovemaking.

02:45.889 --> 02:47.688
Do you think you're a little
too into your cat?

02:47.729 --> 02:49.808
He should be out there,
just getting all crazy,

02:49.885 --> 02:51.485
getting his freak on.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.554
(Sighs) I feel bad, man.
I don't know what to do.

02:53.588 --> 02:55.322
Let's try to help.
We got three smart people here.

02:55.357 --> 02:58.859
We all know we got
to get Furguson laid, right?

02:58.893 --> 03:00.160
Cat bachelor party.

03:00.195 --> 03:01.528
- That's right.
- What do you think?

03:01.563 --> 03:03.063
Yeah, get some little cat strippers.

03:03.098 --> 03:04.498
Big booty cats, little booty cats.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.000
(Laughter)
Some tabbies.

03:06.034 --> 03:07.501
- Some black ones, some white ones.
- Yeah.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.672
We'll mix it up. Get us a couple Siamese,
get weird with it.

03:10.707 --> 03:13.140
- Get him laid?
- You know we're kidding?

03:13.174 --> 03:16.110
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Gotcha.

03:16.144 --> 03:18.212
(Whispers):
It's happening.

03:18.246 --> 03:20.347
(Meowing)

03:20.382 --> 03:23.217
Oh, look, it's you and you.

03:23.251 --> 03:25.552
Is that a cake?
Why do you have a sheet cake?

03:25.587 --> 03:27.354
Don't eat the cake, Jess.

03:27.389 --> 03:30.491
What is that?
Like, vanilla and vanilla?

03:30.525 --> 03:33.594
I just wanted to wish you guys
a happy one-month anniversary.

03:33.628 --> 03:35.596
Hip hip.

03:35.630 --> 03:37.064
You said you wanted to break us up.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.966
You said you didn't care
if it took your whole life.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.802
Look, I understand that I'm not exactly
your favorite person right now,

03:41.836 --> 03:43.937
but I didn't want a milestone
in your relationship like this

03:43.972 --> 03:45.806
to-to go uncelebrated.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.940
You're really great together.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.080
I don't trust him.

03:53.114 --> 03:55.482
I know.
It's Schmidt we're talking about.

03:55.517 --> 04:00.387
After he saw the movie Titanic,
he started the Billy Zane fan club.

04:00.422 --> 04:02.389
- What?
- Look it up. They're called the Zaniacs.

04:02.424 --> 04:07.094
Why does that make me angrier
than anything he's ever done?

04:07.128 --> 04:08.762
- I will handle this.
- Okay.

04:08.797 --> 04:13.500
And I'm gonna test this cake
because I'm so mad at Schmidt.

04:16.142 --> 04:18.272
Hey, dummy,
why'd you get us that cake?

04:18.305 --> 04:19.807
Come on, man,
I'm just happy for you.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.408
Looking at a-a month?

04:21.442 --> 04:22.576
A big month, man.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.012
How many relationships have you had
that have lasted more than a month?

04:25.046 --> 04:26.347
I don't know, some.

04:26.381 --> 04:28.148
Probably very few,
probably very, very few, right?

04:28.183 --> 04:30.317
I mean, you think it's less than two?

04:30.352 --> 04:31.418
One, it's Caroline, you know.

04:31.453 --> 04:33.253
One? Are you kidding me, man?

04:33.288 --> 04:34.988
It's insane. That's so few,

04:35.023 --> 04:38.025
but I guess you only need one,
right, the one. Too soon?

04:38.059 --> 04:39.326
- I'm really happy, Schmidt.
- You should be, man.

04:39.361 --> 04:40.594
Look at you.
You're like a different guy.

04:40.628 --> 04:44.264
Usually at this point,
you're overthinking and anxious

04:44.299 --> 04:46.867
and panicky and overthinking
and overthinking

04:46.901 --> 04:50.137
and distant and nervous
and sweaty and overthinking.

04:50.171 --> 04:51.572
You're trying to get in my head,
and it's not gonna work.

04:51.606 --> 04:53.340
Who could, man? Look at you.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.309
You're cool as a cucumber.

04:55.343 --> 04:57.378
You're Obama on the ski slopes.

04:57.412 --> 04:58.979
Now, get out there.

04:59.013 --> 05:00.514
Enjoy that cake
with the woman that you love.

05:00.548 --> 05:02.116
Too soon? Forget about it.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.283
Good talk.

05:03.318 --> 05:04.418
Yeah.

05:07.322 --> 05:08.288
What's wrong?

05:08.323 --> 05:10.858
Nothing.
(Chuckles)

05:18.266 --> 05:20.067
Uh-oh.

05:20.101 --> 05:23.771
Looks like we have
a little Groundhog Day situation.

05:23.805 --> 05:26.273
Please don't call it a
Groundhog's Day situation.

05:26.307 --> 05:28.876
Six more weeks of winter.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.345
Don't worry.

05:31.379 --> 05:33.046
Lie back.

05:33.081 --> 05:34.448
I'm gonna take care of this.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.083
(Chuckles)

05:36.117 --> 05:37.518
This has never happened
in my whole life,

05:37.552 --> 05:38.952
just so you know.

05:38.987 --> 05:40.554
It's cool.
What can I do to help?

05:40.588 --> 05:43.457
I don't know, maybe
think outside of the box?

05:43.491 --> 05:47.895
(In sexy voice):
A little chicken kabob with rice.

05:47.929 --> 05:51.598
Choice of naan or chutney.

05:51.633 --> 05:53.967
(Groans)

05:54.002 --> 05:57.237
- How about we...
- Shh! Oh, I had it.

05:57.272 --> 05:58.505
Reverse psychology.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.074
I'm not attracted to you.
I don't think you're sexy.

06:01.109 --> 06:02.743
- Don't want to have sex with you.
- Okay.

06:02.777 --> 06:05.913
- I think you're a fat, fat, fatty, fat...
- Okay!

06:05.947 --> 06:09.483
(Humming)

06:09.517 --> 06:11.852
("Get Lucky" by Daft Punk plays)

06:11.886 --> 06:13.420
Oh, yeah.

06:13.455 --> 06:16.857
Papa Smurf? Really?

06:16.891 --> 06:18.225
Whole body.

06:18.259 --> 06:19.226
Are you sure?

06:19.260 --> 06:20.427
- Yes, hey.
- Okay.

06:20.462 --> 06:22.229
- This will work, let's do it.
- Okay.

06:22.263 --> 06:24.531
Okay.
(Groans, screams)

06:24.566 --> 06:27.768
Well, at least the sun
managed to get up.

06:27.802 --> 06:29.236
(Groans)

06:29.270 --> 06:30.771
I have to go move my car.

06:30.805 --> 06:31.839
I'm kidding.

06:31.873 --> 06:33.807
But I'm kidding!

06:33.842 --> 06:37.611
Are we not kidding about this?

06:40.965 --> 06:42.833
WINSTON:
Does she have all her shots?

06:42.867 --> 06:44.168
- Yep.
- Okay, cool, cool.

06:44.202 --> 06:45.736
Um, let me ask you this.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.906
Uh, does she strike you as,
um, I don't know, slutty?

06:48.940 --> 06:51.442
Excuse me, I'm here to pick up
Fatty from her grooming.

06:54.279 --> 06:55.846
Oh.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.114
Oh, there you are.

06:57.148 --> 07:00.184
- Who are you here to pick up?
- Well, actually,

07:00.218 --> 07:03.353
uh, my boy cat is
looking for a girl cat.

07:03.388 --> 07:04.888
Oh.
(Chuckles)

07:04.923 --> 07:09.293
Well, I might know a girl cat
who's looking for a boy cat.

07:09.327 --> 07:11.328
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.362 --> 07:13.730
Does the girl cat have all her parts?

07:13.765 --> 07:17.334
- Um, yeah.
- Yes?

07:17.368 --> 07:20.971
Uh, okay. Well, um, I don't know, maybe,
uh, she could come over sometime?

07:21.005 --> 07:23.774
Like, our cats could go on a date?

07:23.808 --> 07:25.309
Yes, you get it.

07:25.343 --> 07:27.311
You know, everyone else
thought I was being weird.

07:27.345 --> 07:30.714
So, um, how often
do you groom your cat?

07:34.953 --> 07:37.254
(Sighs)

07:41.226 --> 07:43.260
So I talked to my mom about it,

07:43.294 --> 07:44.828
- and my dad...
- I've got to go move my car.

07:44.863 --> 07:46.797
Hey, no, it's important
we talk about these things.

07:46.831 --> 07:49.179
- Nick, it's...
- I'm moving my car!

07:49.214 --> 07:50.834
(Door slams)

07:52.837 --> 07:54.838
Hello.

07:54.873 --> 07:57.407
Whew, Nick looks exhausted.

07:57.442 --> 07:59.776
You guys obviously had a good night.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.145
Yeah, um,

08:02.180 --> 08:03.881
I... We didn't sleep much.

08:03.915 --> 08:06.116
Well, of course you didn't,
you mangy little stray.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.818
I really don't want to talk about it,

08:07.852 --> 08:09.753
- especially not with you, Schmidt.
- I know,

08:09.787 --> 08:12.022
and look, I also realize
that it's gonna be a long time

08:12.056 --> 08:13.257
for me to regain your trust.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.858
I just think it's sad

08:14.893 --> 08:16.660
because if you did have a Nick problem,

08:16.694 --> 08:19.129
I probably could help you out.

08:19.163 --> 08:21.865
You know,
my diploma says that I majored

08:21.900 --> 08:27.104
in communications, but my heart says
that I majored in Nicholas studies.

08:28.873 --> 08:30.340
I'm just saying.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.208
I love the morning.

08:32.243 --> 08:33.610
Anything's possible.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.113
The whole day's ahead
of you, you know?

08:36.147 --> 08:38.282
Last night, Nick
struggled with impotence.

08:38.316 --> 08:41.150
Oh, my God, I'm not
talking you about this.

08:41.184 --> 08:42.785
Jess, look, I get it.
You don't want my help,

08:42.820 --> 08:44.154
but just do me a favor please.

08:44.188 --> 08:46.156
Let me know when you're
not mad at me anymore

08:46.190 --> 08:48.592
so I can tell you about how
men crave danger and variety

08:48.626 --> 08:50.093
in their sexual lives.

08:50.128 --> 08:53.697
I just hope it's not too late,
fingers crossed.

08:55.867 --> 08:56.967
What are you talking about?

08:57.001 --> 08:58.635
I mean, I don't care,

08:58.670 --> 09:01.238
but if I did... theoretically.

09:01.272 --> 09:04.074
Theoretically, I would tell you

09:04.108 --> 09:06.944
for-for a man whose midsection
is basically mush,

09:06.978 --> 09:08.645
Nick has had a lot of sex.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.981
He's pushed that mush
all over town.

09:11.015 --> 09:13.550
And you know what,
he's got some very weird taste.

09:13.585 --> 09:14.885
Dark, real fringe stuff.

09:14.919 --> 09:17.588
He likes stuff
that they don't even have porn for.

09:17.622 --> 09:20.123
And you know, a lot of women
wouldn't think to do the Captain

09:20.158 --> 09:23.193
- in-in bed.
- What?

09:23.227 --> 09:24.962
That was a mistake.
I shouldn't have said anything.

09:24.996 --> 09:27.297
I didn't want to talk about the Captain.
It was a thing, and I did and...

09:27.332 --> 09:28.332
Do you want a smoothie?

09:28.366 --> 09:29.266
What's the Captain?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.168
(Sighs)

09:31.202 --> 09:33.136
Well, it starts off with...

09:33.171 --> 09:34.271
(Blender whirring)

09:34.305 --> 09:36.940
(Muffled talking)

09:36.975 --> 09:38.342
(Blender stops)

09:38.376 --> 09:40.110
But you want to clean
yourself up immediately.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.145
I mean immediately.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.947
(Blender whirring)
And then you...

09:45.783 --> 09:48.151
(Blender stops) How comfortable
are you with racial slurs?

09:48.186 --> 09:49.953
(Blender whirring)
Then you...

09:49.988 --> 09:53.957
(Muffled talking)

09:53.992 --> 09:55.892
(Blender stops)
That's basically it.

09:55.927 --> 09:58.195
That's what Nick wants in bed?

09:58.229 --> 09:59.796
Yeah, I know.
Look, you're probably not up for it.

09:59.831 --> 10:01.064
It's my... It's my fault.

10:01.099 --> 10:03.033
It's very degrading,
it's offensive, and you,

10:03.067 --> 10:05.369
you just don't have the time
to learn all those dolphin sounds.

10:05.403 --> 10:06.937
Are you sure you don't
want some of this smoothie?

10:06.971 --> 10:08.005
It's straw-bana.

10:10.008 --> 10:11.742
Okay, Furguson, this is
a big moment in your life.

10:11.776 --> 10:14.011
All right, just be yourself, you dawg.

10:14.045 --> 10:17.114
Winston, I think I found a way to...

10:17.148 --> 10:20.083
You want to try some catnip?

10:20.118 --> 10:21.785
This is a real bummer.

10:27.792 --> 10:28.992
Ahoy, Nicholas.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.830
- (Imitates foghorn)
- Wait, I'm scared!

10:35.000 --> 10:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:43.652 --> 10:45.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:45.087 --> 10:47.021
I'm so glad you could make it.

10:47.055 --> 10:48.656
- Oh, thanks.
- Let's, um,

10:48.690 --> 10:49.991
let's head to my room.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.192
Oh, you're not wasting any time.

10:51.226 --> 10:52.526
You know, it's just that I have

10:52.561 --> 10:54.061
very judgy roommates,
you know, that might get

10:54.096 --> 10:55.763
a little weirded out if
they walked in the room

10:55.797 --> 10:57.031
and saw something
they weren't supposed to see.

10:57.065 --> 10:58.099
Oh.
(Chuckles)

10:58.133 --> 10:59.967
Or it's whatever, whatever Fatty wants.

11:00.002 --> 11:01.102
What do you want, Fatty?

11:01.136 --> 11:02.837
Fatty wants to see your room.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.639
That's awesome. Great news.
You hear that, Furguson?

11:04.673 --> 11:06.240
- Y'all go play.
- Yeah? There you go.

11:06.275 --> 11:07.875
He was nervous.

11:07.910 --> 11:11.479
Well, good thing I brought this.

11:11.513 --> 11:12.914
Yeah, we can't give wine to these cats.

11:12.948 --> 11:16.217
It's been a tough six months,
and this cat needs a drink so...

11:16.251 --> 11:17.618
O-Okay.

11:17.653 --> 11:18.719
I don't think they care.

11:18.754 --> 11:19.887
- They're not listening at all.
- Mm-mm.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.188
- They're too into each other.
- Yeah.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.859
Nick, we have to talk about this, okay?

11:24.893 --> 11:26.494
All right, I'll go first.

11:26.528 --> 11:28.262
(Sighs)
Listen...

11:28.297 --> 11:31.232
I was uncomfortable
with some of the specifics

11:31.266 --> 11:33.067
of what we just did.

11:33.101 --> 11:36.203
For example, when I said,
"You like that, huh?"

11:36.238 --> 11:40.174
I felt like you really,
really didn't like it.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.043
How do you feel?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.611
I just...

11:43.645 --> 11:45.146
(Laughs nervously)

11:45.180 --> 11:47.048
I feel like, you know...

11:47.082 --> 11:49.684
No, it's just kind of like...
be... I mean...

11:51.887 --> 11:54.322
Uh...

11:54.356 --> 11:56.290
It was good, you know.
It's over.

11:56.325 --> 11:59.527
Love sleeping birdsty.

11:59.561 --> 12:00.561
I just want to know
what I did wrong.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.930
How does the Captain normally go?

12:02.965 --> 12:05.766
- The what?
- The Captain. What we just did.

12:05.801 --> 12:08.669
I've never done that in my life.

12:08.704 --> 12:11.038
- We did that because you wanted to, Jess.
- What?!

12:11.073 --> 12:12.640
Why would I want to do that?

12:12.674 --> 12:16.243
That's degrading to not only women
but all of mankind, Nick.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.578
- I know.
- I only did that

12:17.612 --> 12:20.614
'cause Schmidt told me it
was your favorite thing...

12:22.985 --> 12:26.487
Did you say, 'cause Schmidt said?

12:26.521 --> 12:27.989
No, no, no, no.
Did you just...

12:28.023 --> 12:32.059
Did you talk to...
tight pants and eyebrows...

12:32.094 --> 12:33.427
Who was I supposed
to talk to, Nick?

12:33.462 --> 12:34.862
Every time I tried to talk to you

12:34.896 --> 12:36.998
about your penis problems,
you went to move your car.

12:37.032 --> 12:38.532
Those aren't penis problems.

12:38.567 --> 12:41.769
What is... Did you talk to Winston
about my penis problems?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.704
- What about Cece, did she get a call?
- He wasn't around.

12:43.739 --> 12:46.107
Schmidt told me
he had a PhD in Nickology.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.075
He doesn't. There's no such...

12:48.110 --> 12:49.910
We have to talk about our feelings
'cause we're together.

12:49.945 --> 12:51.946
If we needed to talk about feelings,

12:51.980 --> 12:54.782
they would be called "talkings."

12:54.816 --> 12:56.183
No, that is not true. Nick...

12:56.218 --> 12:57.885
- That is 100%...
- This is it...

12:57.919 --> 12:59.854
This is Schmidt getting in our heads.

12:59.888 --> 13:01.956
- I'm going to kill him!
- Jessica, wait.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.090
Schmidt!

13:03.125 --> 13:04.592
I can't run that fast...
The Captain!

13:04.626 --> 13:06.927
I trusted you.
You took advantage of me.

13:06.962 --> 13:08.963
- Something wrong?
- You set us up.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.132
I've done things to Nick
I can't ever undo.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.200
You see, your fatal flaw...
Communication.

13:13.235 --> 13:15.536
You won't shut up about your feelings,
and the only thing

13:15.570 --> 13:18.606
this dummy wants to talk about
is the Chicago Brown Bears.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.522
It's just the Chicago Bears.
There's no brown...

13:20.563 --> 13:22.531
Who cares? I put a pebble
in your path and the two of you

13:22.644 --> 13:24.045
cracked your tiny little skulls on it.

13:24.079 --> 13:26.714
Ooh, by the way,
how was the Captain?

13:26.748 --> 13:28.150
Did you make it all the way
to the spyglass?

13:28.190 --> 13:30.907
Yes, Schmidt!
And my night vision's very good

13:30.942 --> 13:32.553
'cause my eyes are so buggy and big

13:32.587 --> 13:35.289
and I saw everything and I
can't erase it from my memory.

13:35.323 --> 13:36.991
Please, Jess, stop
talking about the Captain.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.193
Why don't we just go back
to being roommates. Okay?

13:39.227 --> 13:40.694
Nick, what do you say?

13:40.729 --> 13:43.164
The floor is yours.
You want to tell us how you feel?

13:43.198 --> 13:45.232
- Me?
- Yeah.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.601
Well... I think it's...

13:47.636 --> 13:49.170
I just...

13:52.941 --> 13:54.675
Beautifully said. Thank you, Nick.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.810
Enjoy your breakup.

13:55.844 --> 13:59.046
If you need me, I'll be in my room
listening to mainstream hip-hop.

13:59.081 --> 14:00.815
Stop!

14:07.805 --> 14:09.852
I have feelings.

14:14.296 --> 14:17.131
I didn't like
when you did the Captain.

14:17.165 --> 14:18.999
It made me feel...

14:20.669 --> 14:22.036
bad.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.872
Okay, I've... I've never seen
this sober before.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.040
Stop, it's my turn.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.209
You talk too much
and it frustrates me.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.245
Sometimes you talk even
after you've fallen asleep.

14:31.279 --> 14:33.747
How do you breathe?
Where do you get the words?

14:33.782 --> 14:36.617
But it doesn't matter, Jess,
because I like you a lot.

14:36.651 --> 14:39.019
But maybe do that less, okay?

14:39.054 --> 14:41.689
Nick, I just feel... Sorry.

14:41.723 --> 14:42.690
I'm so sorry.

14:42.724 --> 14:44.258
Just... keep going.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.293
I don't know. Um...

14:46.328 --> 14:49.730
I really like the instrument
of the cello.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.999
I like the cell a lot, and
I don't talk about it a lot

14:52.033 --> 14:54.668
but I should because I feel
very passionate about it.

14:54.703 --> 14:56.303
It's a beautiful instrument.

14:56.338 --> 14:58.572
It's like a guitar but it stands up.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.610
I once saw a zebra named Gavin
give birth at the zoo,

15:02.644 --> 15:04.578
and I cried hysterically.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.847
And then I bought one of
those stretched out pennies

15:06.882 --> 15:07.948
that you can get to remember it

15:07.983 --> 15:09.216
and then I lost that
and I cried again.

15:09.251 --> 15:10.951
Sometimes when I smell dust

15:10.986 --> 15:13.654
in like an attic or something,
like that mothy, dusty,

15:13.688 --> 15:15.055
I think about my mother.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.258
When I was 14,
I saw my mother change,

15:17.292 --> 15:19.627
and I saw her whole body naked
without underpants on.

15:19.661 --> 15:21.795
I really like when
a rap song uses a choir.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.597
It makes me feel really happy
when all those ladies' voices

15:23.632 --> 15:25.266
come in and then the guy's rapping.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.267
I think it's awesome.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.801
I'm really proud of you, Nick.

15:27.836 --> 15:30.175
- I really like.
- (Softly): I like you, too.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.773
And it's been a month
and I'm not scared.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.775
Unless you're doing the Captain,

15:34.809 --> 15:38.078
and then I experience very real fear
and it's very visceral...

15:38.113 --> 15:40.080
Just kiss me.

15:40.115 --> 15:41.916
No kissing in the living room!

15:41.950 --> 15:43.717
(Moaning)

15:44.819 --> 15:46.954
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

15:46.988 --> 15:48.989
Cease lovemaking!

15:49.024 --> 15:50.658
All lovemaking must cease.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.259
- Get out of here, Schmidt!
- Break up!

15:52.294 --> 15:54.261
- Just break up already, pl...
- Oh, forget it.

15:54.296 --> 15:56.530
- I'm just... I'm-I'm...
- Hey, no, no.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.659
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, he just hit my sack.

15:58.694 --> 16:01.502
Body block! I'm pure core.
I've been training for this.

16:01.536 --> 16:02.937
Yeah, human dental dam.

16:02.971 --> 16:05.206
(Soft music playing)

16:05.240 --> 16:06.907
So...

16:06.942 --> 16:08.042
What do you do for fun?

16:08.076 --> 16:10.010
Huh? Oh, um...

16:10.045 --> 16:11.712
You know, like all good things.

16:11.746 --> 16:12.846
Like what? Tell me one thing.

16:12.881 --> 16:14.048
(Thumping and shouting in other room)

16:14.082 --> 16:15.516
I'm sorry, do you hear noise?

16:15.550 --> 16:16.817
- Oh...
- Do you hear shouting?

16:16.851 --> 16:18.085
- 'Cause I'm just...
- Yeah.

16:18.119 --> 16:19.253
WINSTON:
No. No, no, no, no, no.

16:19.287 --> 16:20.955
(Thumping continues)
(Winston shouts)

16:20.989 --> 16:23.023
Who the hell mess up the mood?!

16:23.058 --> 16:24.658
(Panting)

16:24.693 --> 16:26.860
- Schmidt, Schmidt.
- Hey.

16:26.895 --> 16:27.828
Put down my condoms.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.530
Pull it together, Schmidt.

16:29.564 --> 16:31.232
It's raining celibacy. Hallelujah.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.067
- You're losing it, man.
- If I'm not having sex in this loft,

16:33.101 --> 16:34.835
nobody's having sex in this loft.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.770
Hyah!

16:37.973 --> 16:39.473
Oh, hey, hey.

16:39.507 --> 16:40.474
NICK:
Hey, hey.

16:40.508 --> 16:41.842
Oh, my birth control pills.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.143
NICK: You don't want to do this,
my man.

16:43.178 --> 16:44.378
Yes, I do want to do this.

16:44.412 --> 16:46.981
It's the only way to get this place back
to the way that it was.

16:47.015 --> 16:48.849
- Put them down. Give them to me.
- Give them to Jess.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.551
Come on, buddy, it's not worth it.

16:50.585 --> 16:51.785
No fear!

16:51.820 --> 16:53.921
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
- JESS: Oh, my God.

16:53.955 --> 16:55.289
Why didn't you just throw
them in the sink, you idiot.

16:55.323 --> 16:57.891
You better pray
that was a placebo week.

16:57.926 --> 16:59.827
Is he eating birth control pills?

16:59.861 --> 17:02.563
Friday! Full wheel, bitches!

17:02.597 --> 17:05.098
(Weakly):
I win. I don't feel good.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.667
Guys, come on, our cats
were just about to have sex.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.771
Oh, my God.

17:10.805 --> 17:13.507
Oh, my God, this whole time
I thought...

17:15.076 --> 17:17.711
(Snorts)
What?

17:17.746 --> 17:18.846
Fatty, come on.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.080
We're out of here.

17:23.652 --> 17:25.919
So, what do you guys think,
loft meeting in 20?

17:25.954 --> 17:27.186
Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

17:27.222 --> 17:30.724
Got to stick my head in a paper bag
and scream at the top of my lungs.

17:30.759 --> 17:31.925
(Chuckles)

17:31.960 --> 17:33.894
Oh, yeah, there'll be no snacks.

17:37.207 --> 17:39.608
(Schmidt moans)
Schmidt, I just looked it up.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.143
There's no way estrogen
works that fast.

17:41.177 --> 17:43.712
- You don't know my body.
- Please, stop talking about your body.

17:43.746 --> 17:45.080
Okay, that's a good segue...

17:45.114 --> 17:47.115
to some of the more relevant topics

17:47.150 --> 17:49.484
that I would like to cover
in this meeting.

17:49.519 --> 17:51.186
Like, uh, personal space.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.988
Public space.

17:53.022 --> 17:54.589
Other people's medicines...

17:54.624 --> 17:56.758
Taking them versus not taking them.

17:56.793 --> 17:58.493
I am so aware
of my nipples right now.

17:58.528 --> 17:59.795
Okay, that's a good start.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.931
If someone were to blow on my nipples,
I would positively scream.

18:02.966 --> 18:03.999
Boundaries.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.133
Any takers?

18:05.168 --> 18:06.335
All right, we live here.

18:06.369 --> 18:07.602
Where are we supposed to go?

18:07.637 --> 18:08.837
This is my fault.

18:08.871 --> 18:11.139
'Cause I'm going through
a sexual awakening.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.008
It's like I'm tapping into

18:13.042 --> 18:15.644
this raw sexual energy

18:15.678 --> 18:17.145
that the universe is putting forth.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.148
And it's just both imploding
and exploding at the same time.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.385
And it's kind of like I'm a young nun.

18:23.419 --> 18:26.254
And Nick is my sexy monseigneur.

18:26.289 --> 18:28.089
And I'm a...

18:29.192 --> 18:30.892
I'm just going to shut up.

18:30.927 --> 18:32.127
Both of you need to shut up, okay?

18:32.161 --> 18:33.495
You're having sex, not inventing.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.197
- It can't be that good.
- It's good.

18:35.231 --> 18:37.312
Stop saying, "Squeeze my biscuits."

18:37.347 --> 18:38.762
- I'm serious, Nick.
- Sorry.

18:38.797 --> 18:40.869
And, Schmidt, stop taking it out
on everybody else, man.

18:40.903 --> 18:42.404
Deal with your breakups.

18:42.438 --> 18:45.724
Ain't no way in hell
I got a cat brothel going on in my room

18:45.763 --> 18:48.443
and I'm the only normal person
in this loft.

18:53.016 --> 18:56.018
You did a bad thing.

18:56.804 --> 18:58.704
Deal with it.

19:16.429 --> 19:17.952
(Door opens)

19:19.542 --> 19:20.742
What's that?

19:20.777 --> 19:24.079
Oh, it's just what I needed.

19:25.848 --> 19:29.084
This gum is crap.

19:29.118 --> 19:30.285
(Man chuckles)

19:30.319 --> 19:31.486
(Elevator bell dings)

19:31.521 --> 19:33.822
(Cece speaks indistinctly)

19:33.856 --> 19:35.490
(Cece laughs softly)

19:35.525 --> 19:36.825
NICK:
You ready?

19:36.859 --> 19:38.026
What is it?

19:38.061 --> 19:39.694
- Just keep your eyes closed.
- (Laughs)

19:39.729 --> 19:42.064
- All right, stand right there, okay?
- Okay.

19:42.999 --> 19:45.500
Turn around.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.203
(Laughing)

19:48.237 --> 19:50.005
- I love it.
- Yeah.

19:50.039 --> 19:53.442
I don't... I don't know what it is.

19:53.476 --> 19:55.777
All right, then yell something.
(Yells)

19:55.812 --> 19:57.145
I soundproofed it.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.480
What's wrong? I just heard yelling.

19:58.514 --> 20:00.781
Get out of here, man.

20:02.018 --> 20:04.586
He must... He must've literally
been right by the door.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.622
It is soundproofed...
That's what the egg crates are for, so...

20:07.657 --> 20:09.858
Nick, I just want
to say something. Um...

20:09.892 --> 20:14.862
This last month... has been
the best month of my life.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.700
Me, too.

20:18.734 --> 20:23.738
I've never, you know, felt this way
or had this with anybody.

20:23.773 --> 20:27.576
It's like there's been
this fog around my life,

20:27.610 --> 20:29.811
and with you,
all of a sudden it's gone.

20:29.846 --> 20:31.646
I love that you can express
your feelings now.

20:31.681 --> 20:32.848
Yeah, it's a weird feeling.

20:32.882 --> 20:34.883
It's kind of like gross but also good.

20:34.917 --> 20:37.052
You know? It's like an egg broke.

20:37.086 --> 20:39.187
And then, like,
all the yolk comes out

20:39.222 --> 20:40.755
but it's good.

20:40.790 --> 20:44.126
I'm happy to admit
I like love songs.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.894
I understand them.

20:45.928 --> 20:47.262
They're really sad.

20:47.296 --> 20:50.499
They're mostly about either
the girl or the guy got away.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.701
They're heartbreaking numbers.

20:52.735 --> 20:54.769
The air... Do you feel it?

20:54.804 --> 20:57.639
I guess this is the air you breathe,
but it's nice.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.541
I feel like I'm on
this whole new planet.

20:59.575 --> 21:02.144
(Clears throat)
How about your two...

21:02.178 --> 21:04.146
favorite planets?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.647
Oh, yeah, those are great.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.816
But I also feel like being with you,

21:07.850 --> 21:10.152
I've finally, for the first time,

21:10.186 --> 21:12.854
and I know this sounds crazy,
but I can see the stars.

21:12.889 --> 21:14.589
You know, the other great thing
about talking about our feelings

21:14.624 --> 21:17.526
is we don't need to do it
all the time.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.627
Thank you for expressing that.

21:18.661 --> 21:20.862
- I feel like I can see you...
- Uh-huh.

21:20.897 --> 21:22.797
...in 3-D vision.

21:22.832 --> 21:25.567
- Everyone see in 3-D.
- Hmm.

21:25.601 --> 21:27.602
So, would you like to take
my bra off, or should I?

21:27.637 --> 21:29.538
See, I feel excited
to take your bra off.

21:29.572 --> 21:31.540
- So, do it.
- I love your breasts.

21:31.574 --> 21:33.805
Just mixing it up with those two things.

21:33.846 --> 21:35.857
- I'm not even nervous to do it.
- So, do it.

21:35.892 --> 21:38.213
- I feel excited to... Okay, right now.
- Let's do this.
