¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.072 --> 00:07.372
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.441 --> 00:09.842
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:09.910 --> 00:12.076
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.145 --> 00:14.412
¶ The mate was a mighty
    sailin' man ¶

00:14.481 --> 00:16.782
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.851 --> 00:19.284
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.352 --> 00:21.420
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.489 --> 00:24.523
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.592 --> 00:26.458
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.527 --> 00:28.493
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.562 --> 00:30.896
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.964 --> 00:33.398
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:35.500
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.569 --> 00:38.170
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:39.738
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:39.807 --> 00:42.741
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

00:42.810 --> 00:45.209

01:14.574 --> 01:16.508
Gentlemen, we have listened
  to your excuses long enough.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.443
And we're not gonna
      put up with it.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.813
- May I have the guava jelly?
 - We got to have some privacy.

01:21.881 --> 01:24.682
- Where is the guava jelly?
- You haven't heard a word said.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.319
Sure I did. You want
      more privacy.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.186
Now, may I have
        the guava jelly?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.654
No, you can't.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.857
We're not gonna serve you
       anything else either.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.060
If you don't cooperate with us,
we won't cooperate with you.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.328
Here's the guava jelly, Skipper.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.530
- Oh, no, you don't.
      - Oh, yes, I do.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.465
- Oh, no, you don't.
       - Oh, yes, I do.

01:40.534 --> 01:44.369
Yes, you did.
         Thanks a lot, Gilligan.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.638
By the way, we're not gonna
  do anymore washing either.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.140
Besides, you said you'd
build us a hut last week.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.276
We've had other things
        that are more important.

01:51.344 --> 01:52.777
We'll get to it soon.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.280
Oh, well, there won't
be any lunch today.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.615
We have other things to do
that are more important.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.717
We'll get to it
       as soon as we can.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.921
Oh, I'm...sorry that
we're-we're late for breakfast.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.824
We're used to having breakfast
 in bed served by our butler.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.493
That's after his butler
serves him breakfast.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.829
Ha ha! That's the only way
to live. Here you are, Lovey.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.398
Oh, dear, isn't there
     anything left?

02:13.467 --> 02:16.368
I'm sorry, Mrs. Howell, but Mary
Ann and Ginger are on strike.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.870
On strike? By George,
you get two workers together

02:18.938 --> 02:20.706
they organize every time.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.741
You men keep promising
     to build us a hut.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.175
And you won't keep
       your promises.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.545
Women should have
the same rights as men.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.246
Ha ha. Did you
hear that, Lovey?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.516
Women should have
the same rights as men.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.151
[laughing]

02:33.220 --> 02:35.520
You're not laughing,
Lovey, with these..

02:35.589 --> 02:37.288
Thurston, you've been
     promising me to build a hut

02:37.357 --> 02:38.490
of our own for weeks now.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.425
I'll get to it by and by.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.560
But I'm not asking
         for anything elaborate.

02:42.629 --> 02:46.397
Just a little split-level hut
   or a palm tree penthouse.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.566
I'm afraid, you women will
   have to face the facts.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.169
Historically, it's the man
who decides what should be done.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.171
- Yeah.
      - Hear, hear, hear!

02:53.240 --> 02:54.872
Haven't you ever heard
     of Lysistrata?

02:54.941 --> 02:57.409
Yeah. Isn't that a mouthwash?

02:57.478 --> 03:00.312
Lysistrata was a woman who lived
thousands of years ago.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.382
And she persuaded all the women
 in her town to ignore the men

03:04.451 --> 03:07.485
completely unless
      they got what they wanted.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.821
Well, I think we should
   all act like Lysis-Lysis..

03:09.890 --> 03:12.123
- Lysistrata, dear.
      - Lysistrata.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.292
That's Greek to me.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.761
Hey, Confucius say,
"Women who stand on rights

03:16.830 --> 03:18.564
sometimes get laughed."

03:18.632 --> 03:19.898
[laughing]

03:22.202 --> 03:24.068
Ha ha. Come on, girls.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.871
We'll build our own hut.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.546
I sure wish you girls
           weren't doing this.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.682
- Did you hear a voice?
  - No, I didn't hear a soul.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.718
Please, man,
    I'd rather do it myself.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.853
But it's very heavy.
   You might strain yourself.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.989
These men must learn,
 we can take care of ourselves.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.125
I took care of myself in a farm
in Kansas and that's tough.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.629
And I took care of myself in
Hollywood and that is tougher.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.499
Ah, ho ho!

03:54.568 --> 03:55.934
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.436
- Ow!
 - Mrs. Howell, are you coming?

03:57.504 --> 03:58.970
In a minute, girls!

03:59.038 --> 04:00.772
Lovey, w-we've been married
     for 19 wonderful years.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.908
And during all that time
        I've taken care of you.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.510
I've watched over you.
          I-I've babied you.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.911
No, no. Look, look, please.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.614
You'll be lost without me.
      Lost, I tell you.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.981
Ready, girls!

04:10.050 --> 04:13.885
Lovey darling, just tell me
     one thing. One last thing.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.221
What color pill do I take
       at noon, please, love?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.390
Oh, the redsies.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.160
No, you must let me.
      You can't do this.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.264
Lovey, you're doing a mad,
impulsive thing. I mean, really.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.066
You can't carry those
heavy bags like that. I..

04:28.135 --> 04:29.768
Thank you, girls.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.569
Now, ladies, please,
I wish you'd reconsider

04:31.638 --> 04:33.605
this whole thing
for your own safety.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.640
Yes, there might be
  wild animals on the island.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.476
- Or wild natives.
       - Or wild life.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.809
They're just trying
to scare us.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.578
And we're not going
             to be scared.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.146
I haven't heard a thing.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.150
As far as I'm concerned,
 we're all alone on the island.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.685
Just the three of us.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.754
Besides, we have everything.
We have blankets, clothes, pots.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.922
What about tools?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.191
Er, by the way,
          have we got any tools?

04:53.260 --> 04:55.193
- Tools?
          - Er, here.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.062
- I'll take this.
       - Good.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.634
I bet they'll be back
     before dark.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.569
I-in tears. An hour
without me, she'll break.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.037
She's utterly dependent upon me.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.205
Really?

05:07.273 --> 05:09.007
Yeah. Besides, I have
the credit card.

05:09.075 --> 05:09.841
[laughing]

05:11.544 --> 05:14.246
[Skipper whistling]

05:14.314 --> 05:16.948
[humming]

05:19.252 --> 05:21.820
Ha, Lovey!
Ha ha.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.689
This is the perfect place
to build our hut.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.358
Can we rest a little longer?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.760
No, we have to have a roof
      by night fall.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.062
We'll lay the first stake
right there.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.398
- Come on. Bring the hammer.
  - Oh, it's heavy.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.533
- I guess I better help.
    - Alright, now, come on.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.235
- Alright.
           - Ready?

05:37.304 --> 05:38.936
- Aim!
             - Ah!

05:39.005 --> 05:40.638
- Swing!
            - Oh!

05:40.707 --> 05:42.440
Drive it in a little further.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.374
- Ready?
            - Ready?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.843
- Up!
             - Aim!

05:45.912 --> 05:48.046
- Swing!
            - Ah!

05:48.115 --> 05:49.848
Can we rest now?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.150
We gotta have this
         hut done by night fall.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.651
Now, I guarantee
those men will come

05:53.720 --> 05:55.987
crawling on their knees
to get us back.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.755
They need us.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.557
Hi, little buddy.
               What's cookin'?

05:59.626 --> 06:01.058
Fish stew.
Try it, Skipper.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.361
Doesn't smell like fish stew.
   What's in it?

06:03.430 --> 06:05.830
Pineapples, coconuts,
and wild berries.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.932
Well, what kind
              of fish, Gilligan?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.634
Fish. Oh, yeah.
I knew I forgot something.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.536
Oh, what have we here, Gilligan?

06:11.605 --> 06:14.139
- Fish stew.
   - It looks like low tide.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.174
Let's have a little taste.

06:16.243 --> 06:19.243
Oh, poor Lovey. I don't know how
she's gonna manage without me.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.613
She must be lying somewhere on
the beach curled up and sobbing.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.182
- 'Hm.'
         - It's awful.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.952
- It'll teach her a lesson.
  - No, no, I mean the stew.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.857
It needs something, boy.
It does need something.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.992
- Fish.
    - Oh, good. Never mind.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.827
Mr. Howell, if it's no good,
  how can I fix it?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.029
You really wanna know?
     You really wanna know?

06:38.097 --> 06:41.733
- I really wanna know.
     - Start over. Hah!

06:41.802 --> 06:43.535
Start over.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.610
We appreciate your help,
    Mr. Howell.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.647
Oh, oh. Yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.148
I do miss the woman's
help, you know?

06:57.217 --> 07:00.218
This cleaning and sweeping
is-is so exhausting.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.787
Maybe it wouldn't be exhausting
 if you did a little work.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.922
Well, I-I'm working,
it's not physical work

07:04.991 --> 07:06.824
but mental work
which is even more difficult.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.092
That's right.
              Especially for me.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.695
I have a plan which
might bring them back.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.864
They are afraid of the night
and wild animals, right?

07:12.932 --> 07:14.232
Who isn't?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.467
Mr. Howell, there are no wild
 animals on this island.

07:16.536 --> 07:20.238
No wild animals, yet.

07:20.306 --> 07:23.542
Now, I have a plan. See,
according to the Howell plan..

07:27.347 --> 07:29.014
Swing!

07:30.517 --> 07:32.818
[screaming]

07:35.922 --> 07:37.955
We should've taken
             the smaller hammer.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.892
They knew it all along. That's
 why they gave us this one.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.261
- We can't go and get it now.
 - Why not?

07:43.330 --> 07:46.664
Well, because they want us to
fail. They won't give it to us.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.199
I think they will.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.901
I don't know why, but men
      always do anything for me.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.738
I know why, darling.
      Go and get it.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.613
Oh, that's-that's fine.
    That-that's fine.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.816
It's coming along fine.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.552
I still think
I should be the head.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.955
Gilligan, you are the tail. I'm
 the head because I'm the brain.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.659
Maybe we need a dragon
     with two tails.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.661
- 'I can't wait until dark.'
  - 'Yeah, yeah.'

08:16.730 --> 08:18.963
(Skipper)
 'Wait till we get there. We'll
 scare the dickens off 'em.'

08:19.032 --> 08:22.099
They'll be asking us to save
    them from the monster.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.002
(Thurston)
      'It's good to have
      a little rehearsal.'

08:24.070 --> 08:27.405
Okay, now. Let's go
      together, gentlemen.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.373
Howl!

08:28.441 --> 08:30.675
[roaring]

08:32.578 --> 08:33.777
Cut! Cut! Cut!

08:33.846 --> 08:35.780
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.917
You've gotta make both ends
sound the same. See what I mean?

08:38.986 --> 08:42.020
Alright, now, the front end,
  let's hear it.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.455
[Skipper roars]

08:43.524 --> 08:45.456
Alright, the rear end,
     let's hear it.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.524
[Gilligan roars]

08:46.593 --> 08:48.592
Alright, now, all together!

08:48.661 --> 08:50.595
[both roaring]

08:51.998 --> 08:56.167
Good heavens, I think we've
found an answer to The Beatles.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.135
Well, we certainly know
 how to handle them, don't we?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.871
I think our plan's better
than their plan.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.072
Can't wait till that
            monster comes here.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.708
Come on.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.687
Gilligan, watch
      where you're going.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.956
I'm sorry, but if you stop that
 fast I'll be in front of you.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.627
I can't put my hand out.
So, be more alert.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.329
- Let's give 'em a little roar.
- Yeah.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.431
- A little roar. Softly.
    - Yeah.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.998
On you mark.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.533
Get set.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.568
Go.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.904
[loud roaring]

09:32.973 --> 09:34.772
Gilligan.
           Gilligan!

09:34.841 --> 09:36.774
I said softly.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.977
Oh, sorry, Skipper.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.982
Okay. On your mark.
      Get set. Go.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.984
[roaring]

09:48.021 --> 09:52.891
Listen to the lovely sounds
  of a tropical evening.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.561
Skipper, they think
             we're crickets.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.164
- Let's give them a real show.
 - Yeah.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.603
[roaring]

10:07.373 --> 10:10.942
Skipper, let's hurry, huh?
      I'm suffocating back here.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.411
Alright. Let's get
over a little closer.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.815
When they come out and see us,
they'll really run home.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.988
Did you see something
move out there?

10:23.056 --> 10:23.654
[roaring]

10:23.723 --> 10:25.089
Something m-m-move?

10:25.158 --> 10:28.293
There's nothing there.
     Now, don't be scared.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.727
[roaring]

10:29.796 --> 10:32.630
- Oh, look at that!
     - Oh, it's a monster!

10:32.699 --> 10:36.066
Oh, we must protect ourselves.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.804
Oh, but how?
Look at that wild beast!

10:39.872 --> 10:41.506
(Ginger)
     'Oh, it's just awful.'

10:41.574 --> 10:43.207
We must fight it off.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.943
We must let the men know
   that we're big and strong.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.878
And should have equal rights.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.548
- But what can we do?
     - We'll kill it.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.019
And send its head
       back to the men.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.090
- Did you hear that?
   - Of course, I heard that.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.625
I'm the part with the ears.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.661
- They want to kill us.
  - They gotta catch us first.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.529
- Yeah.
           - Come on.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.332
[roaring continues]

11:20.814 --> 11:23.548
- 'Skipper!'
         - 'Gilligan!'

11:23.616 --> 11:27.018
You tried to frighten us
  to get us back, didn't you?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.653
No, that's not
              it at all, ladies.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.221
There's a better
          explanation than that.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.089
- Yeah, that's right.
- Er, well. Tell 'em, Gilligan.

11:32.158 --> 11:33.691
Don't just sit there.
           Tell 'em.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.259
Huh?
Oh, yeah.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.061
We were on our way
to a masquerade party.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.397
And we're going
right by the hut..

11:40.466 --> 11:43.200
No, no. We were gonna
celebrate the Chinese new year

11:43.269 --> 11:47.171
with this great dragon,
because next week it's the..

11:47.239 --> 11:51.342
Well, to tell you the truth.
I-I'm open for, uh, suggestions.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.397
You know, without the women
washing clothes is kinda fun.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.231
- That's right, Gilligan.
   - And cleaning up the hut.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.400
- That's kind of enjoyable.
  - Right again, little buddy.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.169
And prepare meals,
that's kind of pleasant.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.904
- Exactly.
     - That was a fun game.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.205
What do we play next?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.374
A game called,
"Back to scrubbing the clothes."

12:23.443 --> 12:24.876
Gilligan, help me
             thread this needle.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.211
Oh, sure, Professor.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.112
By the way, thanks
           for doing my laundry.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.181
- That's okay.
      - I missed it again.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.183
You've got to wet the thread.
 Let me show you.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.252
- Let me do it, Skipper.
    - Never mind, Gilligan.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.822
- Here, I almost got it through.
- You got it through my finger!

12:37.891 --> 12:39.223
Sorry, Skipper.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.525
At times like these a woman
  comes in handy.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.461
It's hard to believe
  they've only gone two days.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.162
Seems more like two years.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.931
Believe me, we've thought
  'em a lesson. There you are.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.168
- Thanks, Skipper.
    - Boy, I sure need this.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.506
- Gilligan.
    - It's no use, Skipper.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.176
Either we get stronger clothes
 or softer rocks.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.844
You get back to scrubbing
       those clothes.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.814
But take it easy this time.
 Our clothes won't last forever.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.716
Excuse me, gentlemen. Did you
   want your dinner well done?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.419
- Well, it's fine, Mr. Howell.
 - I mean, very well done?

13:08.488 --> 13:11.422
- It's okay with me.
    - Very, very well done?

13:11.491 --> 13:12.924
We don't care how
well done, Mr. Howell.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.226
- Oh, good.
- What are we having for dinner?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.828
- Ashes.
- You said you were a good cook.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.298
Well, I am, when I have
    a chef working for me.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.266
I'll be glad when
women learn their lesson.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.802
With them here, we had meals,
clothes, things were easier.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.805
We're trying to prove a point.
They can't get along without us.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.273
But we can get along
            without the women.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.176
Yes! And don't you forget it.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.711
By the way, did you
             happen to notice

13:33.779 --> 13:37.115
what color pill Mrs. Howell
     gives me before din-din?

13:39.018 --> 13:40.984
This is the fourth nail
I've broken today.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.054
Since I got here,
               I broke eleven.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.356
- Eleven?
      - I broke one twice.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.826
Ginger, we're proving
     a principle.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.528
Right. We can get along
without the men.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.064
It's just the men
who can't get along without us.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.033
- I hope so.
- There's no question about it.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.101
Let's not give
    the men another thought.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.005
I sure do miss the women.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.441
Oh, Gilligan, let's not
mention the word women.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.344
Right. They've caused us
    enough trouble.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.646
- I sure do miss the ladies.
  - Gilligan.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.047
- Girls?
          - Gilligan!

14:10.116 --> 14:11.882
I miss the boys
                 with long hair.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.919
Just go to sleep.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.523
Well, here we are.
            It's beddy-bye time.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.126
You're more dressed up to go
to bed than I am to be awake.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.930
You're so right.
         Nighty-night, everyone.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.171
Goodnight, Lovey.
       Wherever you are.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.142
Women.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.978
I'll go along with that.
How about you, Gilligan?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.579
I don't know that much
          about women.

14:42.648 --> 14:46.484
Neither do I. But I've been
  married to one for 22 years.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.154
Oh, if women would just act
the way we wanted 'em to.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.222
You can say that again.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.526
If women would just act
   the way we wanted 'em to.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.428
Come here, my wives.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.432
What is your pleasure,
          mighty potentate?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.267
I have an itch.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.069
Where?

15:38.138 --> 15:41.272
It is pleasant
     wherever you scratch.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.300
Do you like that, Mr. Howell?

16:10.369 --> 16:14.471
Oh, I wish I were scalp
all over. That is marvelous.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.540
Give those a high gloss,
will you, my dear?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.775
I'd love to.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.378
Oh, crazy girl, crazy.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.678
Comfy, dear?

16:21.747 --> 16:24.448
Yes. You don't mind
 the two lovely girls, do you?

16:24.516 --> 16:28.286
Of course not, darling.
  Anything to make you happy.

16:36.796 --> 16:41.265
Oh! Those bubbles tickle.
   Must be vintage 1947.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.471
Oh! Hello, tickle
      the little darling.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.081
Easy, girls. Easy.

Wait a minute.
      Take it easy, girls.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.326
There's enough of me
      for everybody.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.094
Every time I see you,
     I get chills!

17:10.163 --> 17:12.362
- I get goose bumps.
     - Oh, I feel so weak.

17:12.431 --> 17:16.200
Dear me, I don't know
  if I'm an actor or a virus.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.867
Oh, you send chills through me.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.603
We have pictures all over
       the wall and ceiling.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.840
- Even on the floor.
  - Yeah, yeah! Wall to wall.

17:23.910 --> 17:28.479
We take off our shoes and we
  walk barefoot through you.

 brought you. Mejican beauties.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.404
Ah!

18:27.473 --> 18:28.973
I've been gored by a rose.

- Oh, let me kiss it.
     - Let me.

18:31.044 --> 18:34.178
No, no, no.
        Let me kiss it.

Oh, hi, Skipper.

- You've been dreaming.
    - Huh?

19:04.110 --> 19:07.912
Only been in bed a half an hour.
I guess none of us can sleep.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.748
Yeah, we might as well get
    dressed. Go outside and sit.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.126
I think we've been getting along
fine without the women.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.461
- Right, Mr. Howell?
      - Oh, yes, yes.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.562
I've even solved
                my pill problem.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.531
I take one
         of each kind every hour

19:27.600 --> 19:30.033
so I won't miss any of them
     and I feel good.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.136
I rattle when I walk though.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.307
You just wait and see. Those
 women will be back pretty soon.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.242

 - Sixty one hours.

Forty two minutes.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.348
To tell the truth, I'm kinda
    missing the ladies myself.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.217
But there must be some way
      to solve this problem.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.885
I thought of a way.
        It's a real simple idea.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.587
All have to do one thing.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.689
- What?
           - Give up.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.192
Tell 'em they were right, we are
wrong, and ask 'em to come back.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.794
- Never.
       - Absolutely not.

Which one of us

Since I'm the only married man,
 I think I should approach

20:09.809 --> 20:12.676

    the least embarrassing.

20:30.362 --> 20:33.130
Lovey, dear? Ha ha.
      They must be asleep.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.832
Uh, Lovey, dear?

20:41.174 --> 20:42.473
Lovey, dear?

20:50.749 --> 20:51.882
The idea!

20:51.951 --> 20:56.387
- Sneaking around like that.
  - Peeping toms.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.888
- Peeping tom..
      - I can't believe..

21:01.126 --> 21:02.559
Oh, the nerve of them.

21:02.628 --> 21:03.827
Well, maybe they didn't
    know it was you.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.162
I bet they didn't.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.731
Well, who else around here
      calls my wife, Lovey?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.635
- Howell, just cool off.
   - Cool off! I'm drenched.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.773
They must be up to something.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.441
Oh, look!

21:17.510 --> 21:20.244
(Lovey)
  'They made another monster!'

21:20.313 --> 21:21.679
They can't think
     we'd be foolish enough

21:21.748 --> 21:23.748
to fall for another monster.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.482
(Mary Ann)
    'This one's even bigger
    than the last.'

21:25.551 --> 21:26.983
(Ginger)
      'I think it's cute.'

21:27.052 --> 21:29.786
Oh, it just shows how silly
  they are. Men, I mean.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.322
It's ridiculous. It must take
four of them to operate it.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.958
I don't believe it.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.325
[giggling]

21:35.394 --> 21:37.528
[indistinct chattering]

21:45.037 --> 21:47.071
[screaming]

21:47.139 --> 21:49.940
Thurston, thank heavens,
    you've come to save us.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.275
Oh, Thurston.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.010
What's going on here?

21:53.079 --> 21:55.446
- There, look!
         - Look!

21:55.515 --> 21:57.114
Gilligan, we'll get
a closer look.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.816
I can see it fine from here.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.052
Professor, you're in charge.
  We'll be right back.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.987
- O-oh, oh!
          - Gilligan.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.437
- Sure is weird looking.
- Skipper, let's get outta here.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.207
We can't. One of us
        gotta keep an eye on it.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.441
What's the other one
have to do?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.942
Go back and report
              to the others.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.579
- I volunteer on that.
     - You'll do as I say.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.714
- Aye, aye, sir.
      - Keep an eye on it.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.717
- Don't let it get away.
    - Which eye?

22:38.424 --> 22:39.623
Don't know what
I'd do without you.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.992
- Where's Gilligan?
    - Gilligan's been eaten.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.594
Gilligan is fine.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.103
Oh, you stupid monster.
    I'll save us.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.972
Wait, Skipper.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.942
That monster suddenly
           looks very familiar.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.543
Familiar?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.745
(Professor)
 'It's a lost weather balloon.'

23:01.814 --> 23:04.348
It's our rescue. We can inflate
it and send it up with messages.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.383
They always have radio
    equipment. We're saved.

23:06.452 --> 23:07.618
[all cheering]

23:08.821 --> 23:11.555
Ready or not, here I come.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.025
[bang]

23:15.094 --> 23:16.527
[whooshing]

23:19.998 --> 23:21.064
Hot wind!

23:21.133 --> 23:23.334
He's trying to breathe
     fire on me.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.569
If St. George can do it,
    Gilligan can.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.511
No brains!

23:34.580 --> 23:38.048
I did it. I did it.
I killed it. I killed it.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.117
A-ah.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.552
That's the brains.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.488
USAF?

23:44.557 --> 23:48.725
United States
Air Force, balloon.

23:48.794 --> 23:49.927
Oh!

24:08.981 --> 24:10.481
[clattering]

24:11.883 --> 24:14.117
Gilligan certainly did
   a thorough job on this radio.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.686
It's absolutely useless.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.587
You know, Skipper,
I've been thinking.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.423
We still got a chance
with that balloon.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.924
What do you mean Professor?

24:20.993 --> 24:24.628
I can sew up the rips. I can use
some tree sap to seal it.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.663
And hot air from
the fire to inflate it.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.432
It'd make a great rescue signal.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.434
Exactly, a plane or a ship
will spot it.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.769
Hi, Skipper. Hi, Professor.

24:31.837 --> 24:34.137
- Hi.
        - Hi, Gilligan.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.272
- What have you got, Gilligan?
 - It's a big secret.

24:36.341 --> 24:39.109
I've been working on it
       for days. Look, material.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.079
For skirts, for dresses,
        for the hut, huh.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.749
And where did you
             get that, Gilligan?

24:45.818 --> 24:48.152
From the balloon.
    I cut up little pieces.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.562
<i> ["The Ballad</i>
     <i> Of Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

25:04.937 --> 25:06.269
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:06.338 --> 25:07.971
¶ They're here
     for a long long time ¶

25:08.040 --> 25:10.306
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:10.375 --> 25:11.975
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:12.044 --> 25:14.011
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:14.080 --> 25:16.146
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:16.214 --> 25:18.415
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:18.484 --> 25:20.684
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:20.753 --> 25:22.719
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor cars ¶

25:22.788 --> 25:25.155
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:25.224 --> 25:27.324
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:27.393 --> 25:29.259
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:29.327 --> 25:31.494
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:31.563 --> 25:33.663
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:33.732 --> 25:36.300
¶ For seven stranded
      castaways ¶

25:36.369 --> 25:38.202
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶
