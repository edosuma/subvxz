the thought of leaving

18:51.840 --> 18:53.001
You'll need it.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.886

18:55.960 --> 18:57.376

18:57.400 --> 18:59.607
<i>I'd like to talk to you
about Harriet Lauler.</i>

18:59.680 --> 19:02.490
"If I want your opinion,
I will give it to you,"

19:02.560 --> 19:04.005
that's what she told me.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.406
So you know Harriet how?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.530
I was her gynecologist.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.363
So how did you become
Harriet's hairdresser?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.011
She walked in the door
and said, "Cut my hair."

19:13.160 --> 19:14.685
Okay...
And I was like,

19:14.760 --> 19:17.969
"I'm actually cutting somebody
else's hair right now."

19:18.600 --> 19:20.443
And she asked
the woman to leave.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.536
ANNE: I'm <i>calling</i>
from the Bristol Gazette.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.722
I'd like to talk to you
about Harriet Lauler.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.211
(DIAL TONE)

19:26.280 --> 19:27.406
Hello?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.169
I learned a long time ago

19:30.240 --> 19:35.406
if you don't have anything
nice to say about someone,

19:36.440 --> 19:37.771
say nothing at all.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.486
She insisted
on examining herself.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.444
Her diagnosis, always correct.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.444
I had to give her
her co-pay back.

19:55.600 --> 20:01.607
Just a, uh,
hateful, hateful woman.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.291
I hated her.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.970
I hated her so much.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.080
So much.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.160
ANNE: <i>What do you
think of Harriet?</i>

20:15.840 --> 20:21.131
I've worked very hard in
therapy not to think of her.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.729
If there's just one thing
you could say

20:23.800 --> 20:24.961
about her that's nice.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.404
One thing nice.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.324
If she were dead, that would be nice.
How's that?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.286
She's like a human black cloud.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.488
Angriest vagina

20:38.680 --> 20:42.162
"Give me the wafer this way."
"Hand me the wine that way."

20:42.240 --> 20:43.321
"That wine is horrible."

20:44.040 --> 20:46.168
Like, nothing?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.481
Zippo.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.490
(GROANS) I don't...

21:14.280 --> 21:15.725
So this is what you wrote.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.801
It's a first draft.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.570
No. This is a
first paragraph.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.966
It's succinct.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.804
It's one paragraph.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.769
It's to the point
and I think that's good.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.365
No, it's the life of a loser.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.601
(SCOFFS) I wouldn't say that.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.856
This is the life of a nobody.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.166
I definitely wouldn't say that.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.450
Then what would you say?

21:31.560 --> 21:33.403
Because you certainly
have not captured

21:33.520 --> 21:35.807
an impressive life,
an important life.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.124
I did my best.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.881
That is really unfortunate
for both of us.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.450
Well, I didn't have
a lot to work with.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.925
No, you had my life
to work with.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.929
And I did the best
that I could with it.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.171
(SIGHS) Huh.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.683
How grossly I overestimated
your talent as a writer.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.441
With all due respect...

21:57.560 --> 22:00.928
Oh, now you respect me.
I was not really sure of that.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.480
The problem
isn't with my writing.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.245
What is the problem?

22:05.320 --> 22:07.482
It's the subject.
You are the problem.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.561
Excuse me?

22:09.040 --> 22:10.883
You are the problem.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.771
What? How dare you?

22:12.840 --> 22:15.764
No, I... I'm sorry.
How dare you?

22:15.840 --> 22:18.525
No one, and I mean nobody,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.171
had one nice thing
to say about you.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.403
No colleagues, no friends.
Certainly no family.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.720
What did you just say?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.082
I said certainly no family.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.361
Hmm.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.291
Get out of my house.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.730
I'm just... I'm just
being honest with you.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.771
You expected these people
to sing your praises?

22:38.840 --> 22:41.411
I mean, you're way off.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.483
Get out of my house!

I do not wish to be

23:59.720 --> 24:00.846
Sit down, please.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.010
We need to talk.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.326
What is this shit?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.004
These are obituaries

24:06.080 --> 24:08.970
from newspapers
all over the country.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.321
I want you to read them

24:13.400 --> 24:15.801
and see what other
obituary writers are doing.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.121
Wow, I'm sorry you
don't like what I wrote,

24:18.200 --> 24:21.363
but that's... That was just
me writing about your life.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.642
But my life is not over. Yet.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.165
Now, I have determined

24:27.240 --> 24:29.129
there are four
essential elements

24:29.200 --> 24:31.282
to a really great obituary.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.046
(SCOFFS) ls that right?
That's right.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.650
One, the deceased should
be loved by their families.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.801
Right.

24:39.880 --> 24:43.726
Two, the deceased should be
admired by their coworkers.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.370
I... I know.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.721
Three, the deceased must have

24:47.840 --> 24:50.571
touched someone's
life unexpectedly.

24:50.840 --> 24:54.242
And if said person was
a minority or a cripple,

24:54.920 --> 24:56.570
so much the better.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.284
(SIGHS)
Okay, and the fourth?

24:59.360 --> 25:02.842
And the fourth,
that's the wild card.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.207
I do not know
what my wild card is.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.046
Wild card?

25:07.120 --> 25:11.284
Yes, a statement of
such breadth and wonder

25:11.360 --> 25:14.682
that it's the opening
line of the obituary.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.764
For example,
"A noted lover of arts,

25:17.840 --> 25:20.320
"Bonnie Lee Johnson

25:45.120 --> 25:47.930
are not exactly beating down
my door to sing my praises.

I don't know any
crippled black kids.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.567
And four, I have no idea
what the wild card would be.

wanted something else,

"Yes, I like to go there."

something really bad,

kind of budding imagination.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.408
Hi, I'm Robin.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.962

45:25.560 --> 45:27.005
I'm not really
looking at the moment.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.886

your sound transmission

45:32.160 --> 45:33.605
(STAMMERING)
That's right. Yeah.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.081
Is that because of the
Teletronix tube that you use?

45:36.480 --> 45:38.403
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely right.
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, we couldn't afford

and we don't want it.

Damn right.

45:45.840 --> 45:46.921
I'm Harriet Lauler,

45:49.400 --> 45:52.051
I am an older woman,
as you might have gathered.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.929
But with age comes
certain attributes,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.482
and one of mine is I'm up
very early every morning.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.971
I would gladly take over

45:59.040 --> 46:02.010

of Dawn Silver.

would you play?

46:12.680 --> 46:14.648
Robin, are you fucking kidding me?
Wait, just...

46:14.720 --> 46:16.643
Now, that is the wrong question.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.326
Is it?
Hmm.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.080
What's the right question?

46:21.200 --> 46:24.010
(CHUCKLES) The right question
would be what would I play

46:24.080 --> 46:26.526
<i>after</i> I <i>play Nina Simone's
Gin House Blues.</i>

46:27.600 --> 46:29.856
What would you play after you played
Nina Simone's Gin House <i>Blues?</i>

46:29.880 --> 46:31.291
Good question.
Thank you very much.

46:31.360 --> 46:34.011
I would play Very Special,
Duke Ellington.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.127
Great.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.965
Then I would play
Van Morrison, Ro Ro <i>Rosey.</i>

46:38.040 --> 46:40.805
Great. And I'd probably end
with something by The Kinks.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.201
You like The Kinks?

46:43.360 --> 46:45.601

I keep saying that.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.641
Don't I always say that?

46:49.720 --> 46:52.724
You see, Robin, anybody
can pick a good song.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.322
But a true disc jockey
is interested in the flow,

46:56.400 --> 46:59.927
in the sequencing,
in the block, if you will.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.131
I am very interested
in the block.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.201
And I'm very wealthy,

47:03.280 --> 47:05.169

to have a salary.

most people are idiots.

47:31.560 --> 47:32.561
Yeah.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.847
So when you're confronted
by an idiot,

47:35.200 --> 47:38.522
rather than make themselves
aware of their idiocy,

47:39.480 --> 47:42.563
it's best just to treat them
like a dumb, stupid child

47:42.680 --> 47:44.728

any better, you know?

47:44.840 --> 47:46.683

learning to compromise.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.041

miserable instead of one.

buys an alpaca farm.

a small fortune

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.649

uncomfortable couch!

I wrote it.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.723
The truth is, I didn't think
that in the matter of

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.320
a couple weeks, a month,

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.483
that I would be standing here

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.040
talking about a woman
that I truly loved.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.171
A woman who made me
want to quit my job.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.241
(LAUGHS)

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.160
And a woman who made me feel
like I was a piece of shit.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.807
Um...

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.764
But she didn't feel
that way about me.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.888
And she didn't feel that way
about any of you.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.606
She was just challenging us to
be the best... Our best selves.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:22.762
Because she saw what we had,

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.445
that we didn't, and that's...

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:31.446
That's the most amazing thing.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.601
Um...

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.047
So...

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.607
(SNIFFLES)

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.045
I think it's a really good thing

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.326
that we knew Harriet Lauler.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.925
I think it sucks that she died.

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.447
But,

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.090
at the end of the day,

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.207
all I really needed to say,

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.611
all I really ever needed to say

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.489
was that she will not
be forgotten.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.528
That's the best that
any of us could hope for.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.523
That we will not be forgotten.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.088
Harriet Lauler lived her life.

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.486
And I'm going to honor her
memory by doing the same.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.650
(MOURNERS APPLAUDING)

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:18.242
(FOLK ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.880
ANNE: <i>This is not
my letter of resignation.</i>

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.684
<i>This is my obituary.</i>

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.369
<i>The young girl who worked for
you for the last seven years</i>

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.208
<i>is dead and buried.</i>

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.244
<i>She leaves behind a lifetime</i>

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.442
<i>of indecision,
hesitation and fear.</i>

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.845
<i>She will not be missed.
She will not be mourned.</i>

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.761
<i>Because she was really
never alive to begin with.</i>

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.206
<i>But she is now.</i>

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.803
<i>And she has her entire life
in front of her.</i>

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.451
<i>An entire life
just waiting to be filled.</i>

01:43:00.305 --> 01:43:06.437
