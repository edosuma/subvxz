WEBVTT

00:05.514 --> 00:08.778
You think
you're better than him.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.737
But someday you'll find
where you meet.

00:10.867 --> 00:12.216
You will see.

00:12.347 --> 00:14.436
My name is Alexander Pope.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.786
Some years ago,
I took a man like you

00:16.917 --> 00:19.572
and made him into a man
like Howard Silk.

00:21.138 --> 00:23.053
That accident... that was Pope?!

00:23.184 --> 00:24.228
That's why
she's in the hospital?!

00:24.359 --> 00:25.882
I miss my wife.

00:26.013 --> 00:28.145
I need to go home.

00:28.276 --> 00:30.713
A few months ago,
I started getting these letters.

00:30.844 --> 00:33.803
Other Howard's wife.
She was my contact.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.022
Three known operatives
have crossed

00:35.152 --> 00:37.372
in the last couple of days.

00:37.503 --> 00:38.808
I think it's time
we talk to your wife.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.419
I'm turning you in.

00:40.549 --> 00:41.942
What about Spencer?

00:42.072 --> 00:43.857
Have you thought it through?

00:43.987 --> 00:45.380
Peter, what are you doing?

00:48.818 --> 00:49.950
There's nothing you can do.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.212
It's all underway.

00:56.783 --> 00:59.438
We can't touch him now.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.137
He's on the border.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:26.470 --> 04:28.255
Do you know
the motive of the shooters?

04:28.385 --> 04:30.126
One shooter, there was just one.

04:30.257 --> 04:32.694
Initial reports said
there were multiple gunmen.

04:32.825 --> 04:35.131
Reports
from last night were inaccurate.

04:35.262 --> 04:37.830
There were not multiple gunmen.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.919
This was not a conspiracy.

04:40.049 --> 04:43.879
This was an isolated,
tragic case

04:44.010 --> 04:45.620
of workplace violence.

04:45.751 --> 04:47.796
Will there be an investigation?

04:47.927 --> 04:50.146
We have no further
comment at this time.

04:50.277 --> 04:51.931
I would like to ask that we all

04:52.061 --> 04:55.804
respect the privacy
of our employees

04:55.935 --> 04:57.806
and their families.

04:57.937 --> 04:59.678
Right.

04:59.808 --> 05:03.377
Doctor wants to see you
one more time before discharge.

05:05.727 --> 05:07.903
How do you feel?

05:08.034 --> 05:10.471
Your wife was worried.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.865
I told her a fractured clavicle
is nothing.

05:12.995 --> 05:16.608
Except you won't be able to
carry your baby for a few weeks.

05:16.738 --> 05:19.262
Jacqueline has a baby girl, too.

05:19.393 --> 05:20.873
16 months old.

05:21.003 --> 05:22.396
Showed me pictures, adorable.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.008
The police were coming.

05:26.139 --> 05:28.445
Because of the alcohol
in your blood.

05:28.576 --> 05:31.318
But someone from your job
called it off.

05:31.448 --> 05:32.928
You're very lucky.

05:52.905 --> 05:54.689
So it was all for this.

05:58.867 --> 06:02.001
Five years of marriage, just...

06:02.131 --> 06:05.352
preparation.

06:05.482 --> 06:07.441
Peter, it hasn't even begun.

06:07.571 --> 06:11.227
The next few hours, days, months

06:11.358 --> 06:13.229
are gonna get very complicated.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.449
You'll see.

06:15.579 --> 06:17.581
The next step is for Diplomacy
to get involved.

06:21.411 --> 06:23.675
That wasn't suicide.

06:23.805 --> 06:26.634
You had your seat belt fastened.

06:28.984 --> 06:31.247
You were trying to give us
an alibi, weren't you?

06:33.206 --> 06:36.296
Because you've chosen
to protect our family

06:36.426 --> 06:37.819
over everything else.

06:40.039 --> 06:43.433
We're going to need each other
if we're gonna get through this.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.701
Go straight to work
when they discharge you.

06:49.831 --> 06:51.311
You should be seen like this.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.750
Where are you going?

06:55.881 --> 06:58.057
To check on the baby.

06:58.187 --> 07:00.537
I'll be waiting for you at home.

07:08.502 --> 07:10.330
I need to talk to you.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.810
What the hell is she doing here?

07:11.940 --> 07:12.854
Bob, you need to listen to her.

07:12.985 --> 07:14.334
Got to go downstairs.

07:14.464 --> 07:16.771
Diplomacy's drafting
a statement of condolence.

07:16.902 --> 07:17.946
We're keeping it sweet.

07:18.077 --> 07:20.166
It is gonna blow up in your face.

07:20.296 --> 07:22.472
There was an attack
on their Office, wasn't there?

07:22.603 --> 07:25.040
Multiple shooters,
identities unknown.

07:30.002 --> 07:31.917
How do you know that?

07:32.047 --> 07:33.745
This office is compromised.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.442
We need to gather
people we can trust

07:35.572 --> 07:37.444
and formulate a response
before it gets even worse.

07:37.574 --> 07:39.446
How the hell do you two
know what's going on here?

07:39.576 --> 07:42.405
Bob, our side was behind this.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.671
What happened over there
started here, in these offices,

07:47.802 --> 07:50.196
planned and executed
by agents from our side.

07:50.326 --> 07:54.417
Right now, our neighbors
are no doubt discovering this.

07:54.548 --> 07:56.028
How do you think
they're gonna respond

07:56.158 --> 07:59.509
to your statements
of sweet condolence?

08:06.473 --> 08:08.736
Then I just go to the church?

08:08.867 --> 08:11.608
3:00. He'll be there.

08:11.739 --> 08:14.002
Okay.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.571
Just so you know...
Pope doesn't make deals.

08:20.661 --> 08:22.794
I don't think
I have any other choice.

08:33.065 --> 08:35.719
If he was in my position,
what would he do?

08:35.850 --> 08:37.634
He would run, too.

09:00.483 --> 09:02.007
Same as the other two.

09:02.137 --> 09:04.357
Left their doubles
for us to find.

09:04.487 --> 09:06.663
They want us to know
it was them.

09:06.794 --> 09:10.058
You're gonna clean this up,
before any police find it.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.060
- What about Quayle and his wife?
- Not now.

09:12.191 --> 09:14.019
I know what you want,
and I want it, too.

09:14.149 --> 09:16.151
But she's a director's daughter.

09:16.282 --> 09:17.849
We need to be careful.

09:20.634 --> 09:22.810
Go to Silk's hospital.

09:24.986 --> 09:27.467
Fuck Silk and fuck his wife.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.469
If he knows who's behind this,
we need him back.

09:32.254 --> 09:34.430
Now go.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.834
Media's been taken care of.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.054
I take it you know
the cover story.

11:16.184 --> 11:18.056
Yeah. No, I-I saw you
on the television.

11:18.186 --> 11:19.971
Lone shooter.

11:20.101 --> 11:22.321
That's the key.

11:22.451 --> 11:24.976
Mental illness...
that'll shut down all questions.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.369
I'd offer you a drink, but...

11:29.241 --> 11:31.156
Clare's fine, by the way.

11:31.286 --> 11:33.593
She's-she's been
discharged already.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.466
Well, I'm glad to hear
that she's fine.

11:40.426 --> 11:44.169
W-We were fighting in the...

11:44.299 --> 11:46.736
There's...
We-we spoke this morning.

11:46.867 --> 11:49.130
We're sorting things out,
and we're...

11:51.263 --> 11:53.178
I'm so sorry.

11:53.308 --> 11:56.050
For everything that's happened.

11:56.181 --> 11:57.878
I bought her a scarf.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.228
Cl-Clare?

12:00.359 --> 12:02.404
Helen, my secretary.

12:04.711 --> 12:08.367
I bought her a scarf.
It was her birthday.

12:08.497 --> 12:13.372
And then this woman,
whoever she was,

12:13.502 --> 12:17.637
she looks me right in the eye,
semi-automatic in her hand...

12:17.767 --> 12:19.813
walks right by me.

12:19.943 --> 12:24.209
Why would she just
walk right by me?

12:24.339 --> 12:26.211
How many shooters were there?

12:26.341 --> 12:28.691
Two dead.

12:28.822 --> 12:33.131
The third managed to crawl
halfway through the Crossing.

12:33.261 --> 12:35.263
Where he remains.

12:35.394 --> 12:38.092
He-he's...
he's-he's still alive?

12:38.223 --> 12:40.312
For now.

12:40.442 --> 12:43.750
That young man, that assassin,
doesn't belong to us.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.447
They need to take
possession of him.

12:45.578 --> 12:48.363
They need to acknowledge
that these murderers

12:48.494 --> 12:50.017
come from their side.

12:51.975 --> 12:53.847
And you knew about it.

12:57.981 --> 13:00.332
That deal we tried to make.

13:00.462 --> 13:02.812
With Lambert, with the Embassy.

13:02.943 --> 13:04.814
The contractor.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.342
You tried to convince me
to hold on to her.

13:12.518 --> 13:14.476
And I didn't listen.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.444
I didn't listen to a word.

13:31.363 --> 13:34.105
Fourth Floor wants to meet.

13:34.235 --> 13:36.063
They're coming down shortly.

13:36.194 --> 13:37.717
Management?

13:37.847 --> 13:40.241
Th-They're coming down here?

13:40.372 --> 13:43.418
I want you with me.

13:43.549 --> 13:45.377
If that's okay with you.

15:37.706 --> 15:40.796
Upstairs would like to thank
everyone for gathering.

15:42.624 --> 15:44.409
This is Management?

15:44.539 --> 15:46.280
It's as close as we get.

15:52.634 --> 15:55.071
Management would like
an explanation.

15:55.202 --> 15:58.423
Uh, I'm going to be handing this
over to Emily Burton.

15:58.553 --> 16:00.338
She's been working this
for Counterintelligence

16:00.468 --> 16:02.470
and has a better sense
of what's going on

16:02.601 --> 16:05.081
than anyone at this table.
So, Emily?

16:06.518 --> 16:08.476
Mr. Quayle,

16:08.607 --> 16:11.436
Upstairs asks
if these conspirators

16:11.566 --> 16:13.264
belong to our neighboring world.

16:21.446 --> 16:23.752
Um, yes.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.016
They-they were citizens of
the other world, hiding in ours.

16:27.147 --> 16:29.280
It was an illegal program,

16:29.410 --> 16:31.456
coded Indigo.

16:31.586 --> 16:34.328
Financed from secret coffers
we haven't been able to trace.

16:34.459 --> 16:37.679
For years,
they have been cultivating

16:37.810 --> 16:40.943
sleeper cells, children

16:41.074 --> 16:44.860
that have been trained in the
art of replacing their others.

16:44.991 --> 16:48.473
They believe the '96 epidemic
was our doing.

16:48.603 --> 16:51.737
And this was
their act of revenge.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.957
We believe Indigo has already
placed agents on the other side.

16:55.088 --> 16:56.742
We don't know
who these agents are,

16:56.872 --> 16:59.005
we don't know how many of them
are in our midst,

16:59.135 --> 17:01.486
but we suspect

17:01.616 --> 17:04.444
that this is just the beginning.

17:04.576 --> 17:07.012
The surviving shooter
has now collapsed

17:07.143 --> 17:09.885
in neutral diplomatic territory.

17:10.016 --> 17:14.586
It is possible that
he has done this on purpose

17:14.715 --> 17:17.545
and that Indigo hopes
that we will claim the body

17:17.675 --> 17:19.416
and thus acknowledge
the assassins

17:19.547 --> 17:21.114
as belonging to our world.

17:21.243 --> 17:25.465
If we deny any part of it,

17:25.597 --> 17:28.817
our neighbors might see this
as an open...

17:28.948 --> 17:31.429
declaration of war.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.957
Strategy recommends
that we go into No Man's Land,

17:38.087 --> 17:39.524
retrieve the shooter
and question him.

17:39.654 --> 17:41.047
I wouldn't be so quick to that.

17:41.177 --> 17:44.616
Diplomacy would like
to hold off,

17:44.746 --> 17:47.532
wait and see what our neighbors
do about the shooter.

17:47.662 --> 17:49.838
He's still alive down there.
We need to get answers.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.014
We need payback.

17:52.145 --> 17:53.581
We're gonna be asking
for reparations.

17:53.712 --> 17:56.192
In order to do that,
it's better to wait

17:56.323 --> 17:57.977
and let the other side
claim the body,

17:58.107 --> 17:59.587
acknowledge their role in this,

17:59.718 --> 18:00.936
and then shove it
down their throats.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.373
This isn't about reparations.

18:02.503 --> 18:04.375
These people just killed
11 of our own...

18:06.855 --> 18:10.598
Management would like for Mr.
Quayle to make a recommendation.

18:10.729 --> 18:13.819
Peter Quayle is
a junior deputy director.

18:13.949 --> 18:15.995
It is the understanding
of Management that he is

18:16.125 --> 18:18.214
the only one in your department
who saw this coming.

18:18.345 --> 18:20.826
Mr. Quayle, please proceed.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.879
I suggest we do nothing.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.012
Don't touch the body.

18:33.142 --> 18:35.014
Let the other side act first.

18:40.672 --> 18:44.676
Upstairs requests
a full investigation

18:44.806 --> 18:48.723
into all of those responsible
for this horrific act.

18:48.854 --> 18:51.900
They ask
that Mr. Dwyer get underway.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.599
Understood. First priority.

18:54.729 --> 18:59.386
As for the conspirator
who remains in the Crossing...

19:01.127 --> 19:03.085
It is the position of Management

19:03.216 --> 19:05.566
that we do not claim him.

19:05.697 --> 19:08.656
Management, with respect,

19:08.787 --> 19:11.529
in the 30 years
since the Crossing has appeared,

19:11.659 --> 19:13.661
there have been spy games,

19:13.792 --> 19:16.229
clandestine
intelligence gathering,

19:16.359 --> 19:19.188
but never have we witnessed
a direct attack

19:19.319 --> 19:21.364
- on our neighbors' sovereignty.
- Emily...

19:21.495 --> 19:24.237
I urge you,
lay the cards on the table.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.545
Claim the body
and admit that this is the work

19:27.675 --> 19:30.199
of a rogue faction,
that we need their help.

19:30.330 --> 19:33.681
If we don't, we'll be playing
into this faction's hands.

19:33.812 --> 19:37.380
It could be the end
of diplomacy between our worlds.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.953
Management has conferred.

19:48.783 --> 19:50.655
The man will remain where he is.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.875
The man stays where he is.

19:54.006 --> 19:56.574
We cannot acknowledge
any part of this.

19:56.704 --> 19:59.315
Furthermore,
Management has requested

19:59.446 --> 20:02.580
that any other infiltrators
be hunted down immediately.

20:02.710 --> 20:04.451
A specialist will be
assigned to work

20:04.582 --> 20:07.933
with Deputy Director Quayle
in this matter.

20:08.063 --> 20:10.370
Mr. Quayle,

20:10.501 --> 20:13.852
Management thanks you
for your excellent work.

20:23.383 --> 20:27.213
On the other side of the door,
I can be a different me.

20:27.343 --> 20:30.651
As smart and as brave,

20:30.782 --> 20:33.872
as funny and as strong

20:34.002 --> 20:36.527
as a person could want to be.

20:36.657 --> 20:40.356
On the other side of the door,

20:40.487 --> 20:43.142
I can be a different me.

20:43.272 --> 20:46.101
As smart and as brave...

21:02.161 --> 21:04.642
- Would you like to tell me?
- What?

21:04.772 --> 21:07.427
One time, before I have to ask.

21:11.257 --> 21:13.694
Who are you?

21:13.825 --> 21:16.044
You know who I am.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.046
Nadia, yes.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.831
I knew that.

21:19.961 --> 21:22.529
But you never told me
your last name.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.705
I should've seen it
all over the fucking news.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.712
That's not me.

21:31.843 --> 21:33.845
I'm calling the police.

21:33.975 --> 21:36.195
- She was a sister. Twin.
- Stop it.

21:36.325 --> 21:37.849
A sister with the same name?

21:37.979 --> 21:39.851
Is that what you expect me
to believe?

21:39.981 --> 21:43.594
No, don't do...

21:45.291 --> 21:47.467
What the hell are you always
hiding in here?

22:02.308 --> 22:04.266
Who are you?

22:06.529 --> 22:09.750
Please, don't make me
keep asking like this.

22:12.492 --> 22:15.974
I-I'm someone who thought
she could be something else.

22:19.934 --> 22:22.023
She's the real Nadia, I'm sorry.

22:24.286 --> 22:26.201
I'm the one who didn't turn out.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.082
Get out.

22:38.561 --> 22:39.650
No.

22:39.780 --> 22:42.522
Get out of here.

22:42.653 --> 22:43.915
- No, please.
- Just get out of here.

22:44.045 --> 22:45.394
- No, no...
- Whatever the fuck you are.

22:45.525 --> 22:46.787
Come on, get out!

24:11.176 --> 24:12.917
What a pleasant surprise.

24:13.047 --> 24:15.310
I need to talk.

24:15.441 --> 24:17.225
By all means.

24:43.338 --> 24:45.079
Oh. My sweet girl.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.038
Oh, my poor, sweet girl.

24:47.168 --> 24:49.127
- Oh. Oh!
- Hi, Mom.

24:49.257 --> 24:50.998
Look at you.
That idiot bastard...

24:51.129 --> 24:52.304
look what he did.

24:52.434 --> 24:55.089
No, it was my fault.
We were arguing.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.526
You should have seen him
when I picked her up. A mess.

24:57.657 --> 25:00.312
I swear,
if I'd smelled it on him...

25:00.442 --> 25:02.009
Have you heard from your father?

25:02.140 --> 25:03.837
No.

25:03.968 --> 25:06.187
He's been there all night.

25:06.318 --> 25:09.974
It's just unthinkable.

25:10.104 --> 25:14.065
Maria, from Friedrich's office...
she's dead.

25:14.195 --> 25:17.590
You think, they just went
to work like any other day.

25:21.463 --> 25:23.639
You know, your father is worried
about you. You should call.

25:30.516 --> 25:33.388
I had this flashback
to Switzerland.

25:33.519 --> 25:35.738
Your accident,
your poor little legs.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.654
A mother never stops worrying.

25:38.785 --> 25:41.005
You wait until your little
monkey's all grown up

25:41.135 --> 25:42.920
and you'll see.

25:45.096 --> 25:47.533
Oh, God.

25:51.015 --> 25:53.365
Is there anything
we should be talking about?

25:53.495 --> 25:55.933
Mom, it's my marriage.

25:58.631 --> 26:00.981
Every marriage has problems.

26:03.897 --> 26:06.726
Your father, I love him,
but he's a stubborn man.

26:08.641 --> 26:10.556
I almost left him once.

26:12.384 --> 26:14.690
It was a long time ago.

26:14.821 --> 26:16.170
People didn't marry for love.

26:16.301 --> 26:18.651
You did it because...

26:18.781 --> 26:20.827
that's what you did.

26:23.221 --> 26:24.700
But I grew to love him.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.750
Did you ever feel like
you were faking it?

26:33.579 --> 26:35.276
All the time.

26:38.671 --> 26:41.282
I don't know what to do.

26:41.413 --> 26:45.547
I have these fantasies about
running away.

26:49.377 --> 26:52.946
Can I give you some advice?

26:53.077 --> 26:56.341
When things seem to be
their most difficult

26:56.471 --> 26:59.474
and you just want
to leave it all,

26:59.605 --> 27:02.303
you put on a smile
and you cook a nice meal,

27:02.434 --> 27:06.090
and you pretend
that everything is fine.

27:06.220 --> 27:09.963
And eventually it is.

28:54.981 --> 28:57.418
The sons of bitches
never touched him.

28:57.549 --> 28:58.637
He's dead?

29:02.597 --> 29:05.296
How do you think
our side's going to respond?

29:11.998 --> 29:13.173
What's going on?

29:13.304 --> 29:14.827
You should see this.

29:32.975 --> 29:34.673
They're closing their doors.

29:48.252 --> 29:51.733
Thus endeth diplomacy.

30:17.455 --> 30:18.847
Yes?

30:18.978 --> 30:21.546
I want you to know
I'm disappearing.

30:21.676 --> 30:24.723
Sorry I couldn't stop
any of this from happening.

30:27.943 --> 30:31.643
I need you to... make sure
that Emily is protected.

30:31.773 --> 30:34.211
You know she's Housekeeping.

30:34.341 --> 30:36.604
She's the one who gave me
all this intel.

30:36.735 --> 30:40.173
She probably knows more about
what's still gonna happen.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.657
So I'm asking you...

30:45.787 --> 30:48.094
to please keep her safe.

30:48.225 --> 30:52.185
I wonder who's gonna
take care of her in the future,

30:52.316 --> 30:54.274
now that your other
is never coming back.

30:54.405 --> 30:57.451
Crossing's been closed.

30:57.582 --> 30:59.497
A response to
what your people did.

30:59.627 --> 31:01.716
I don't think it's gonna be
open for some time.

31:01.847 --> 31:04.110
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- No.

31:04.241 --> 31:07.026
You're not gonna disappear,

31:07.157 --> 31:09.159
now that his life
belongs to you.

31:09.289 --> 31:13.380
I saw how you put on his
clothes, walked in his shoes.

31:13.511 --> 31:15.252
You're not gonna
give up his life.

31:15.382 --> 31:17.689
You want it.

31:17.819 --> 31:19.517
Let me prove that to you.

31:19.647 --> 31:23.738
I'm here with her right now.

31:23.869 --> 31:26.611
I'm pulling my men
out of the hospital.

31:26.741 --> 31:28.613
Our enemies still want her gone.

31:28.743 --> 31:31.964
How long do you think
she'll survive alone?

31:34.140 --> 31:36.055
Your choice.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.806
What is it that finally
brings us together?

31:47.936 --> 31:51.984
Well, since I've...

31:52.114 --> 31:54.291
come to this side...

31:56.815 --> 32:00.558
So many things have-have
come into focus for me.

32:00.688 --> 32:03.909
Until very recently,
I was an Interface man.

32:04.039 --> 32:07.173
And now that I,
that I've seen...

32:09.654 --> 32:13.484
everything that I've seen, uh...

32:13.614 --> 32:18.053
so much of my life
makes sense to me now...

32:19.185 --> 32:21.056
so many things that I,
that I wondered about.

32:21.187 --> 32:25.409
And-and a part of me began
to believe that maybe I could

32:25.539 --> 32:29.630
belong here.

32:29.761 --> 32:32.503
Or-or that something here
could belong to me.

32:32.633 --> 32:36.158
But the longer I stay here,

32:36.289 --> 32:38.509
the more I-I...

32:38.639 --> 32:42.339
I find myself... becoming...

32:44.428 --> 32:46.386
Him.

32:52.523 --> 32:56.004
I know that you control
who comes and goes.

32:56.135 --> 33:00.618
I need you to help me
get back home.

33:00.748 --> 33:04.535
I'm your enemy, Howard.

33:04.665 --> 33:06.711
I'm the one who tried
to kill your wife.

33:06.841 --> 33:08.103
Yes, I know.

33:08.234 --> 33:11.498
And if you help me
get back to her,

33:11.629 --> 33:13.500
I will take her far away.

33:13.631 --> 33:16.547
I-I can talk to her.

33:16.677 --> 33:21.291
And if she even wakes up...

33:24.032 --> 33:26.905
I swear to you,
we will never bother you again.

33:29.995 --> 33:33.215
This is how you wanted
to win me over?

33:35.392 --> 33:38.046
This was your plan?

33:38.177 --> 33:40.745
Amazing...

33:40.875 --> 33:43.487
what the years will do
to break the human spirit.

33:48.753 --> 33:50.058
When your other was young

33:50.189 --> 33:53.323
and found out
who his wife really was,

33:53.453 --> 33:56.587
he cast away this Interface life

33:56.717 --> 33:58.850
and ran to this.

34:03.071 --> 34:05.944
My dear boy.

34:06.074 --> 34:09.208
I'm perfectly able
to give you what you want.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.732
But for that to happen,

34:11.862 --> 34:16.257
this sad, groveling promise
of neutrality...

34:16.389 --> 34:19.523
no, no, that just won't do.

34:26.443 --> 34:30.141
If you want your life back,

34:30.272 --> 34:32.884
I'm going to need more.

34:43.460 --> 34:47.551
I've lost your other's
loyalty recently.

34:47.681 --> 34:52.033
It appears that vile woman has
finally turned him against me.

34:52.164 --> 34:55.559
Which means I'll need
another man across the fence.

34:55.688 --> 34:58.344
You want me to work for you?

35:01.042 --> 35:03.088
I...

35:03.218 --> 35:05.438
She would never forgive me.

35:05.569 --> 35:08.267
Yes, but you don't
actually know her,

35:08.398 --> 35:10.269
do you, Howard?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.011
Come over here.

35:13.141 --> 35:15.535
There's something
I want you to see.

35:17.494 --> 35:21.193
W-Would you bring me my glasses
from the mantelpiece?

35:21.323 --> 35:23.804
Some of my people found this

35:23.935 --> 35:28.374
on Emily Burton's person
the night of her mishap.

35:28.505 --> 35:30.420
Have you ever wondered

35:30.550 --> 35:33.205
why your other came to you
when he did?

35:35.990 --> 35:40.038
"Howard, I trust my last letters
have reached you safely.

35:40.168 --> 35:43.563
"They're onto me now.
You're the only one I can trust.

35:43.694 --> 35:47.828
"I need for you to reach out
to the other Howard.

35:47.959 --> 35:50.875
"He knows nothing
about any of this, or me.

35:51.005 --> 35:54.748
I beg of you that he never learn
who I really was..."

35:54.879 --> 35:56.446
What? What is this?

35:56.576 --> 35:58.622
There's more of them
somewhere, I'm sure.

35:58.752 --> 36:01.320
He carried on the correspondence

36:01.451 --> 36:05.367
with your wife
for quite some time.

36:05.498 --> 36:07.457
Makes you wonder
what he'll do over there,

36:07.587 --> 36:09.763
now that he has her alone.

36:12.897 --> 36:15.856
You sad little man.

36:15.987 --> 36:19.338
Don't you realize
the fight you're in?

36:19.469 --> 36:21.645
It's Darwinian.

36:21.775 --> 36:24.865
There's only room
for one of you.

36:24.996 --> 36:27.520
If you don't become him,
he will become you.

36:27.651 --> 36:29.000
No.

36:29.130 --> 36:32.090
I-I know what
you want me to say.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.962
But I won't.

36:35.093 --> 36:38.879
I am not him.

36:39.010 --> 36:42.709
I will not make the kind
of mistakes he's made.

36:44.929 --> 36:47.453
Yes, I suppose you're right.

36:50.587 --> 36:53.764
In which case,
you're no good to me, Howard.

36:56.070 --> 36:58.986
There's no point in us
even having this conversation.

36:59.117 --> 37:03.077
After all that's passed,
you're so fucking stupid...

37:27.014 --> 37:28.973
Howard?

38:22.635 --> 38:23.941
It's okay.

38:30.861 --> 38:32.166
We don't have much time.

38:32.297 --> 38:33.951
It's a trap.

38:34.081 --> 38:36.301
They're gonna kill us both.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.166
Even if you'd managed
to pull this off,

39:15.296 --> 39:16.907
they'd never stop chasing you.

39:17.037 --> 39:18.604
What do you want?

39:26.394 --> 39:27.874
I want you to take this.

39:32.792 --> 39:35.012
Should be enough in there to
offset what they're paying you.

39:35.142 --> 39:37.231
And I want you to walk away.

39:37.362 --> 39:40.104
Disappear.

39:40.234 --> 39:41.671
Forget about her.

39:44.499 --> 39:47.024
She is not your wife.
She is his.

39:50.462 --> 39:52.943
So this is where you meet.

39:53.073 --> 39:54.945
We have a deal?

40:13.572 --> 40:15.792
There's nobody in the room.

41:11.499 --> 41:13.763
Drop the gun.

41:13.893 --> 41:15.721
Drop it.

41:24.251 --> 41:27.037
You're a little more sentimental
than you think.

41:39.876 --> 41:42.487
This one was for me.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.276
I... I-I didn't have a choice.

42:37.281 --> 42:39.109
Of course you didn't.

42:46.333 --> 42:49.815
I just want to go home.

42:49.946 --> 42:53.819
I... I didn't...
want to come here.

42:53.950 --> 42:56.648
I-I...

42:56.778 --> 42:59.869
I came because I-I thought
I was doing the right thing.

43:02.436 --> 43:07.093
And-and then I saw what he had,
and I just...

43:14.666 --> 43:16.929
I am not him.

43:19.279 --> 43:21.281
I know, Howard.

43:28.332 --> 43:29.507
But here's the thing.

43:32.989 --> 43:34.904
From where I stand...

43:37.863 --> 43:39.691
you two are completely alike.

43:55.315 --> 43:57.927
Take him to ECHO.

43:58.057 --> 44:00.886
Are you sure
you want to do that?

44:04.237 --> 44:08.589
Tell him... I don't ever want
to see this bastard again.

44:31.351 --> 44:32.483
Clare?

44:39.316 --> 44:40.882
Clare?

44:45.104 --> 44:46.888
Clare!

44:58.161 --> 45:00.250
I wanted to clean this up.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.600
I'm sorry you had to see this.

45:06.256 --> 45:08.954
He wanted to...

45:09.085 --> 45:11.739
He was going to kill me.

45:39.593 --> 45:41.291
You okay?

45:44.990 --> 45:46.905
What can I do?

46:00.875 --> 46:02.399
Ian?

46:09.797 --> 46:13.714
Just came back from Pope's.

46:13.845 --> 46:16.021
Quite a mess
your ex made over there.

46:16.152 --> 46:19.198
If we can call him your ex.

46:22.245 --> 46:25.030
- Well, where is he?
- Where is he?

46:26.901 --> 46:28.860
That's the first question
out of your mouth?

46:33.908 --> 46:35.954
Ian, you would never
have understood.

46:45.833 --> 46:47.748
Did you feel something for him?

46:56.366 --> 46:59.108
If I did, it was just a...

46:59.238 --> 47:01.632
phantom limb.

47:13.165 --> 47:15.602
I'll keep your name out of this.

47:43.543 --> 47:44.979
This seat taken?

47:49.462 --> 47:50.985
Scotch.

48:04.999 --> 48:06.784
What the hell happened to you?

48:09.090 --> 48:10.918
Aldrich's looking for you.

48:12.529 --> 48:14.879
Yeah.

48:15.009 --> 48:17.838
Aldrich's not gonna be a problem
for either one of us anymore.

48:25.716 --> 48:27.848
We need to come
to an understanding.

48:30.155 --> 48:33.158
Believe me, I would get
the hell out of here if I could.

48:33.289 --> 48:36.640
But circumstances, it seems,

48:36.770 --> 48:38.555
compel me to stay.

48:41.471 --> 48:45.475
I assume this mole hunt
will continue, escalate...

48:45.605 --> 48:48.652
Yeah.

48:48.782 --> 48:50.915
They've put me in charge of it.

48:51.045 --> 48:52.569
Really?

48:53.874 --> 48:55.528
Yeah.

48:55.659 --> 48:58.705
Yeah.

48:58.836 --> 49:02.187
All right, listen.

49:02.318 --> 49:05.756
We need to call a truce.

49:05.886 --> 49:08.367
There's a woman in the hospital.

49:08.498 --> 49:11.240
Means a great deal to me.

49:11.370 --> 49:13.503
So I give you my word:

49:13.633 --> 49:17.768
Nobody finds out about your wife

49:17.898 --> 49:21.511
as long as
nothing happens to mine.

49:21.641 --> 49:22.947
Your wife?

49:24.862 --> 49:26.342
You know what I mean.

49:37.222 --> 49:39.224
See you at the office, I guess.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.294
Hungry?

50:08.949 --> 50:10.864
Famished.

52:28.349 --> 52:32.005
"You, you only, exist.

52:34.573 --> 52:36.401
"We pass away,

52:36.532 --> 52:41.101
"till at last
our passing is so immense

52:41.232 --> 52:43.800
"that you arise,
beautiful moment...

53:06.300 --> 53:09.608
"...arising in love...

53:14.483 --> 53:19.096
"...or enchanted
in the contraction of work.

53:19.226 --> 53:23.404
"To you I belong.

53:26.538 --> 53:30.281
"However, time may wear me away.

53:32.588 --> 53:36.417
From you to you..."

53:37.305 --> 53:43.172
