(HUMMING)

00:09.857 --> 00:12.025
Good morning, sweetie.

00:12.059 --> 00:14.661
I have two days
off for Christmas

00:14.695 --> 00:17.030
and I'm going to
devote myself to
being a good mom.

00:17.064 --> 00:18.965
Who are you
and what have you done
with my real mom?

00:18.999 --> 00:19.966
Oh, stop.

00:19.967 --> 00:23.836
Here, let me pour you
a bowl of cereal.

00:24.939 --> 00:26.806
Oh!

00:26.840 --> 00:28.340
Mmm, my favorite.
Frosted mini-hints.

00:31.078 --> 00:33.947
Mom, I get it.
You told me 10 times

00:33.981 --> 00:35.682
you want this scarf
for Christmas.

00:35.716 --> 00:38.017
Actually,
it was my birthday.

00:38.052 --> 00:39.953
It's cashmere
and it comes in
four different colors.

00:39.987 --> 00:41.721
But look,
the aqua blue...

00:41.755 --> 00:43.056
Goes well with your eyes.

00:43.057 --> 00:45.725
Mom, this is insulting.

00:45.759 --> 00:48.728
I mean,
it's Christmas Eve.

00:48.762 --> 00:50.964
You don't think I got
your gift already?

00:50.998 --> 00:52.932
Of course you did.

00:52.967 --> 00:57.804
No, honey, I just
really want something
that's from your heart,

00:57.838 --> 00:59.872
that isn't homemade.

00:59.907 --> 01:01.841
Oh, speaking of homemade,

01:01.875 --> 01:03.076
I gotta go pick up
our Christmas dinner
in aox.

01:03.077 --> 01:04.944
Bye!

01:04.979 --> 01:06.746
Love you.
Love you, too.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.280
Bye, Mom!

01:09.683 --> 01:11.183
Ho, ho, ho!

01:11.919 --> 01:13.786
Save it. We've got to
go, go, go to the mall.

01:16.657 --> 01:17.423
I gotta go buy
my mom a scarf.

01:17.424 --> 01:19.726
Last minute
stocking-stuffer?

01:19.760 --> 01:20.860
No. As last minute

01:20.861 --> 01:21.995
"I already told
her I got her something

01:21.996 --> 01:23.630
"and if I show
up empty-handed,

01:23.664 --> 01:25.164
"I'll never live it
down"-stuffer.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.935
So, I'm guessing
you'll be giving me the gift
of friendship this year.

01:28.969 --> 01:31.037
Again.

01:31.972 --> 01:35.975
Okay,
grab your tinsel and
keep your arms and legs

01:36.010 --> 01:38.878

at all times,
because Christmas

01:38.912 --> 01:40.947

01:46.720 --> 01:50.023
Doesn't matter if you've
been good or bad if Santa
doesn't know where you live.

I'll just be sitting

03:40.801 --> 03:42.802
and strangers make
their dreams come true.

03:42.836 --> 03:44.737
And the best part is

03:44.772 --> 03:46.906
all the letters
have been taken.

03:46.940 --> 03:49.876
Except for that one
under the tree.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.744
What? No!
Hold this.

03:52.913 --> 03:54.914

were like you.

04:12.365 --> 04:14.233
Dina? Friend?

04:14.267 --> 04:15.767
Hello?

04:18.370 --> 04:20.105
Well, merry Christmas
to you, too!

04:28.215 --> 04:31.217

I brought you a hot cider.

Oh, thanks, Dina.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.088
Hot! Hot! Hot!

04:36.122 --> 04:39.058
Yeah, sweetie,
that would be the
"hot" part of hot cider.

04:41.027 --> 04:42.328
Who are they?
Oh, those are
some of my cousins.

04:42.329 --> 04:44.129
We're caroling at
the big holiday show

Oh, sorry, Dina, you can't.
It's a family thing.

Oh, I understand, baby.

04:56.176 --> 04:57.343
Good morning, everyone,
I hope the mats are down,

04:57.344 --> 05:01.413
because I'm ready to start
the vocal gymnastics.

the family is he from,

05:06.152 --> 05:10.322
your mom's side,
or the liar-liar side?

For Flynn,
we make an exception.

05:12.259 --> 05:14.159

Dina, I can't just
put you in the group.

05:41.421 --> 05:44.123
There has to be
a family meeting
with a family vote.

They may be your family,

05:47.193 --> 05:50.062
but I am the one
who may or may not be

the mistletoe later.

05:51.398 --> 05:53.265

She'll be joining
us this year.

No. Not Rocky.

with a single mom.

"Dear Santa,
longtime fan,

06:14.220 --> 06:18.324
"I really want the
GS Handheld MegaGame 195.

that many zeroes
since your last report card.

06:54.427 --> 06:56.995
Whoa!

06:57.230 --> 06:59.164
Your mom is
going to love it.

06:59.199 --> 07:01.166
I know.

07:01.201 --> 07:04.303
She's gonna want
to borrow it
all the time.

07:04.337 --> 07:07.106
CeCe, what about
your mom's scarf?

07:07.140 --> 07:10.943

I still have plenty of...

07:10.977 --> 07:12.211

07:12.212 --> 07:15.180
Okay, CeCe, you have
to return this purse.

gives me a sign

that likes foccacia bread.

Okay. You're hired.

07:34.134 --> 07:38.237
You hear, that Sy?
I got another elf.

07:38.271 --> 07:40.272
It's a Christmas miracle!

What? You heard him.
It's a Christmas miracle.

11:29.302 --> 11:30.369
I can't lose
another job.

11:30.370 --> 11:35.040
So what I'm hearing is
I get to play Santa again.

11:35.074 --> 11:36.574
Don't have to
ask me twice.

11:39.979 --> 11:41.146
So, how's the
great toy hunt?

11:41.147 --> 11:43.281
Not good.

11:43.316 --> 11:48.020
You know, at one point, I even
considered going through
the Toys for Tots box.

11:48.054 --> 11:49.988
Oh, who am I kidding?
I did go through it.

11:50.023 --> 11:51.323
Couldn't find it
in there.

11:51.324 --> 11:54.092
Hey, you two!

11:54.127 --> 11:56.161
You look so cute!

11:56.195 --> 12:00.032
What is this?
Is this a <i>Shake It Up,</i>
<i>Chicago!</i> publicity stunt?

12:00.066 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, let's
go with that.

12:02.035 --> 12:05.037
Oh, good, because
I was afraid you
blew all your money

12:05.071 --> 12:06.171
before you bought
my present

12:06.172 --> 12:09.107
and you had to
do this to make
some extra cash.

12:09.142 --> 12:11.910
Don't be ridiculous.

12:11.944 --> 12:14.146
Now, my manager's
going to be back
any second,

12:14.180 --> 12:16.181
so you either have
to be Donner or Blitzen.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.956
Hey, just F-Y-I,
Altman's still has

12:24.991 --> 12:27.292
two of those
beautiful scarves left.

12:27.326 --> 12:28.527
Well, three, really.

12:28.528 --> 12:31.997
There's one
hidden in a Crock-Pot
in the kitchen section.

12:32.031 --> 12:35.133
A Crock-Pot
not being used
to make food?

12:35.168 --> 12:37.035
Sounds just like
the one at home.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.303
Ohthat reminds me.

12:38.304 --> 12:42.040
I still have to pick up
that Christmas
dinner in a box.

12:42.075 --> 12:45.110
Oh, well, if worse
comes to worst,
we'll just get deli.

12:45.144 --> 12:46.644
Bye, girls.

12:49.282 --> 12:50.082
I can't believe it.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.284
There it is!
That's my toy!

12:52.318 --> 12:53.318
That woman
has my toy!

12:53.319 --> 12:54.986
Excuse me!

13:03.015 --> 13:06.985
Deuce, I'm desperate.
I need the GS Handheld
MegaGame 195.

13:07.019 --> 13:10.188
(LAUGHS) Okay.
It's Christmas Eve.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.023
Do you really think
I have the most

13:12.058 --> 13:13.325
impossible-to-get toy
in the country?

13:13.326 --> 13:16.061
Because if you do,

13:17.063 --> 13:18.196
you're absolutely correct!

13:18.197 --> 13:20.932
Oh! Thank you, Deuce,
you're the best!

13:20.967 --> 13:23.068
Wait, not so fast.
It's gonna cost you.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.036
Cost me? Cost me.
Yeah.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.572
Oh, hello.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.208
Listen and listen good.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.010
Do you know what
I've been through
to find that toy?

13:32.044 --> 13:34.079
I have not only lost
the Christmas spirit,

13:34.113 --> 13:37.082
but I am temporarily banned
from the Lakefield Mall.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.986
So, hand it over,
or I'm stuffing you
into a stocking.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.023
Can I gift wrap
that for you?

13:45.057 --> 13:47.292
That won't be
necessary.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.030
Oh. Oh, and, Dina.

13:52.064 --> 13:55.200
Don't think I forgot
about you ditching me
under that tree.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.071
And merry Christmas,
everyone!

14:02.925 --> 14:05.861
Okay. All right,
let's try this again.

14:05.895 --> 14:07.829
This time
I'm gonna move
some of you around

14:07.864 --> 14:10.031
just to balance
out the sound.
All right?

Little further.

14:24.046 --> 14:26.882
Yeah. One more
big step.

14:26.916 --> 14:29.150
Yeah, keep going.
Keep going. Better.

14:32.054 --> 14:35.056
Dude, her voice
is neither joyful
nor triumphant.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.860
You gotta cut Dina
before the mall show.

14:38.895 --> 14:41.863
I can't do that, man.
She's my girlfriend.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.132
Well, you can either
have the voice
of an angel

14:44.166 --> 14:47.035
or the voice of a cat
being thrown
into a blender.

14:49.071 --> 14:50.972
Okay, fine.
I'll tell her.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.975
Look what I found!

14:54.010 --> 14:55.510
Mistletoe!

14:59.148 --> 15:02.851
What? She had mistletoe!

15:02.885 --> 15:04.853
That was parsley,
you jinglehead!
Get it together, man!

15:11.027 --> 15:14.095
Look, I love you
and you love me.

15:16.799 --> 15:19.000
And we would have been
so fabulous together,

15:19.035 --> 15:22.938
but there's someone
who's come between us.

15:22.972 --> 15:24.472
My mom.

15:25.908 --> 15:27.876
Stop looking
at me like that!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.079
It's like they say.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.783
If you love something,
set it free.

15:34.817 --> 15:37.185
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find a scarf
in a Crock-Pot.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.823
But first,
one last fling.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.134
Okay, here she comes.
And make it believable.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.136

16:12.788 --> 16:15.824
(GASPS) Oh, I have
a phone call.

16:15.858 --> 16:17.759
The reason
you didn't hear it ring

16:17.793 --> 16:19.227
is because
it's on vibrate.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.864
I did that so it
wouldn't interrupt us
while we were rehearsing...

16:22.898 --> 16:24.398

16:28.938 --> 16:30.805
What's that?

The fountain
at the mall
overflowed

16:32.008 --> 16:33.908
and the stage
got flooded
and it's underwater?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.113
So there's no show
whatsoever?

16:38.147 --> 16:40.882
Don't even bother
going there, you say?

16:41.984 --> 16:43.985
Well, thanks
for calling.

go door-to-door.

No! No, let's not
do that to people.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.806
