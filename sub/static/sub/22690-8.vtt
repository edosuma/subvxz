01:02.729 --> 01:04.397
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.485
- How is she today?
- Same.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.071
Okay.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.032
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.085
Your therapy lamp arrived.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
That's great.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.257
I told them
you weren't getting enough sunshine.

01:32.175 --> 01:37.347
And I know that you, um...
Well, I know how that upsets you.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.441
Oh, good.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.735
Good. They're cleaning your teeth.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.821
I pay 'em extra for that.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.199
Gotta look after those teeth.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.370
Very important to have a good smile
in your line of business, right?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.164
Keep those customers happy.

02:03.165 --> 02:07.210
Nothing like a nice smile
to let 'em know that you give a shit.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.216
I've had a tough week.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
This...

02:17.554 --> 02:20.056
this old friend of mine is back in town.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.520
A smile is not gonna be good enough
for him.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.731
This guy's been... Well, he's maybe the...

02:29.691 --> 02:33.069
the only real friend that I ever had.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.488
And now I think that...

02:38.408 --> 02:41.578
Well, he thinks that he wants to take away

02:41.661 --> 02:45.415
everything that I've worked so hard for
all these years.

02:51.045 --> 02:57.552
Do you know that you are maybe
the only person in the entire world

02:57.635 --> 03:01.097
that I can be truly honest with?
Do you... Do you know that?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.517
I mean, I gave this guy...

03:05.268 --> 03:08.771
I gave this guy... a choice.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.941
I mean, I gave him a chance
for things to go down differently.

03:12.024 --> 03:13.943
You know? And...

03:14.026 --> 03:15.487
Shit.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.122
Getting a little lively there,
don't you think?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.961
Well, I guess you would have
a strong constitution

03:32.045 --> 03:34.839
when it comes to narcotics.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.846
Would you change anything?

03:42.930 --> 03:43.931
If you could?

03:44.682 --> 03:45.683
Because, you...

03:47.143 --> 03:48.478
you had a choice.

03:49.061 --> 03:52.274
Me, I never did. You saw to that.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.317
And yet...

03:58.154 --> 03:59.155
here I am.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.994
You know, all those years
in those group homes...

04:05.953 --> 04:07.539
gives you a lot of time to think.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.382
And now I'm returning the favor.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.056
Maybe you did me a solid, you know?

04:25.139 --> 04:29.269
I mean, the way I see it,
you want weak kids, give 'em everything.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.814
But if you... If you want 'em strong...

04:40.071 --> 04:41.197
treat 'em hard.

04:46.536 --> 04:51.416
Easy. Easy. Easy.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.591
That's it.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.318
You know, I'd have given you...

05:20.445 --> 05:21.529
the world.

05:24.198 --> 05:28.536
I'd have given you...
anything that you ever wanted...

05:31.414 --> 05:32.707
if you'd just wanted me.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.549
See you next week, Mom.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.465
Uh... hey, Frank?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.800
- Huh?
- You wanna come here?

07:08.177 --> 07:10.179
I've been running the image
from your scope.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.390
- Mmm.
- Found him.

07:13.390 --> 07:14.434
Holy shit.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.814
- Yeah, you did.
- William "Bill" Rawlins III.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
He's the director
of covert operations for the CIA.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.276
Now it's starting to make sense.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.821
This is not some field agent
running rogue.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.949
I mean, it takes a guy like this to pull
it all together and make it stick.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.869
"Injured in the line of duty."
That's from me smashing his eye in.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.513
Son of a bitch used it
to climb the ladder.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.664
No, he didn't.
He was born at the top of the ladder.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.168
The Rawlinses are practically royalty.
They're the power behind the throne.

07:40.251 --> 07:43.838
They're old, old Virginia money.
Plantations, shipping and industry, arms.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.466
I mean, who knows what else
they have their hands in.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.026
Sounds like you got a crush on the guy.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.178
He's the director of covert ops, Frank.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.429
I mean, for all I know...

07:54.807 --> 07:57.059
- Shit.
- What is it?

07:58.144 --> 08:01.063
For all I know, he's been waiting
for somebody to look for him.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.733
And by searching his file,
I've just blown us.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.536
There could be a team
on its way right here.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.819
- Wait.
- Give me a second...

08:06.903 --> 08:07.983
No, you give me a second.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.989
You've been on that CIA site
all day, right?

08:10.072 --> 08:12.617
You seen anything about us?
Any chatter at all?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.785
- What... No.
- Have you?

08:13.868 --> 08:14.952
- No, right?
- No.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.204
You're saying
the guy's got unlimited resources.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.081
You're saying he's the kinda guy,

08:19.165 --> 08:22.168
he farts, the president catches a whiff.
That's what you're telling me?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.003
Uh, yeah, actually.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.214
Okay, David, CIA and the FBI,
they're not coming after us.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.259
You didn't see anything on there
about Kentucky, right?

08:30.342 --> 08:32.260
Nothing about me being on an army base?

08:32.344 --> 08:34.054
Yeah. I mean, the Bulletin ran a piece

08:34.138 --> 08:37.642
about Bennett turning up stabbed to death
in a motel upstate, but that's it.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.269
They killed him. That's good.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.731
Look, the point is
they're not coming after us.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.568
I mean, I took a shot at this guy,
you didn't read anything about it.

08:48.235 --> 08:49.821
You're scared, David, and I get that,

08:49.904 --> 08:51.989
but think about how
this Rawlins prick feels.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.826
I think that you and me,
we are sitting pretty right now.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.081
I'm going to make coffee.
Want me to get you something?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.669
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll have some chamomile. Thanks.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.754
Some chamomile, huh?

09:21.936 --> 09:22.937
Frank!

09:23.020 --> 09:25.397
This guy. What?

09:25.481 --> 09:28.150
Um, the cameras in my house are down.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.737
- What's that?
- I can't...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.948
I can't access the feed
to my house right now.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.613
You need to get over there now
and check on my family.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.641
- Wait a second. David, I just...
- You need to check on my family right now!

09:42.665 --> 09:45.459
All right. All right. All right.
Christ's sake.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.189
What?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.490
What happened there?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.743
Paintball.
It was from a training exercise.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.413
That is what a real battle scar
looks like.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.791
AK-47, through and through.

10:30.587 --> 10:31.588
Thank you.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.677
What about this guy? Hmm?

10:36.761 --> 10:37.970
Appendix, right?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.766
Knifed by an angry lover.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.102
You are so full of shit.
Do you know that?

10:47.814 --> 10:51.358
All those battle scars,
and not one on this pretty face.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.573
What about Big Nasty here?
Can't believe you didn't brag about him.

10:57.990 --> 10:58.990
Let me guess.

10:59.951 --> 11:03.329
Your chute didn't open.
You got dragged behind the plane.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.958
You had to cut free. Fell through a tree,
hitting every branch on the way down.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.501
And sewed yourself up.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.927
There was this good Samaritan
used to volunteer

11:18.010 --> 11:19.929
at the Ray of Hope Group Home.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.245
It's where I was placed at the time.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.895
We used to play stickball,
hoops, whatever.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.459
He'd been going there for years.
We all thought he was so cool.

11:31.190 --> 11:36.028
I guess I must've been...
ten, eleven at the time.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.075
When a grown man tells you
that you're pretty...

11:41.492 --> 11:43.160
you know nothing good is coming.

11:44.078 --> 11:48.207
Let's just say I wasn't interested in...
in the kind of games that he had in mind.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.377
So I went after him
with the stickball bat.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.921
Caught him good a couple times, too.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.716
Then he broke my arm.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.679
Got pissed off, ripped my rotator cuff
in three places, so...

12:05.766 --> 12:07.852
Your face.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.399
I didn't know
you grew up in the system.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.193
Is that not in my file?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.614
Guess I deserve that.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.995
I can see it right now on your face,

12:26.078 --> 12:30.499
that sudden middle-class guilt
for growing up in a place like this.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.961
You know what?
I'm not exactly sure where I was born.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.629
But the way that I see it,

12:35.713 --> 12:39.508
even if your meth head mother safe-havens
you at a fire station in Albany...

12:40.009 --> 12:42.428
you're still born
in the greatest country in the world.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.807
Sorry you had to go through that.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.518
Yeah.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.357
You know, it means something.
You shared this with me.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.859
We gotta be careful.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.196
We're in danger
of having a real conversation.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.157
- It's getting kinda personal here.
- Yeah, wouldn't want that.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.241
No.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.369
Then we would have to admit
that maybe you like me.

13:10.497 --> 13:11.790
Do you ever look for her?

13:12.374 --> 13:13.459
Who? My mother?

13:14.919 --> 13:15.920
Nah.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.465
No such thing
as a fairy-tale ending, Madani.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.426
That shit is for the storybooks.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.290
- Hey.
- Jesus!

13:53.374 --> 13:55.292
I didn't mean to scare you.

13:55.376 --> 14:00.506
I tried the front there.
There was no answer, so I, um... I just...

14:01.090 --> 14:04.510
I don't know. To thank you.
You know, apology, whatever. You could...

14:04.593 --> 14:06.303
You could pick.

14:07.221 --> 14:11.350
- Maybe I could trade?
- Great. Thank you.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.602
All right, that's for you.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.106
- What do I do with these?
- Uh, trash cans are over there.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.946
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.037
Do you, um...
You wanna join me for a drink?

14:32.496 --> 14:35.082
Mmm... Sure, yeah.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.626
- Really?
- Okay.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.130
Uh, okay.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.382
The glasses are
in the cupboard over there.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.466
- Oh.
- Hmm.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.349
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.895
Mmm.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.065
- You a wine guy, Pete?
- A wine guy?

15:00.649 --> 15:04.403
Uh, I drank the Boone's Farm,
you know, Mad Dog till I was 20.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.990
So, yeah...
I'm quite the connoisseur.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.492
Okay, so you...
You're not gonna judge me

15:10.576 --> 15:13.329
for appreciating a little rosé
all year round, huh?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.247
I'll do my best to hold off.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.335
Hmm. It is a rare treat...

15:19.418 --> 15:22.171
...to enjoy a glass of wine
in the middle of the day.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.839
Is that why you unplugged?

15:26.717 --> 15:30.137
- Get a little peace and quiet, huh?
- Yeah, no, not exactly. Um...

15:31.305 --> 15:34.600
I was trying to punish Zach
for acting like such a little shit.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.643
Trying to make a point.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.188
- Did it work?
- It might've...

15:39.771 --> 15:42.984
but I, um...
I let him go out with his friends.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.778
I just... I couldn't bear the prospect
of listening to him bitch

15:46.862 --> 15:49.156
about being unplugged
from the Internet all day.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.660
Does that make me a bad mom?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.291
I think that makes you human.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Hmm.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.296
But now a part of me wishes
that he was here, you know?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.465
I kind of miss the noise.

16:11.595 --> 16:18.060
Have you ever turned your phone off
just so you can stop hoping it'll ring?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.396
Who is it that you wanna talk to?

16:20.896 --> 16:22.814
Anybody with a friendly voice...

16:24.233 --> 16:26.735
that's not a bill collector.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.195
But, hey, you know what?

16:28.695 --> 16:33.409
Guy shows up with a bouquet of flowers...
who am I to complain, huh?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.288
You know, I think I'm gonna, uh...

16:38.372 --> 16:41.625
I'mma get myself some of this.
That is good shit.

16:41.708 --> 16:43.460
It's good.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.645
What's up?

17:02.646 --> 17:03.939
Got a new lead on Castle.

17:04.647 --> 17:06.483
- You're shitting me.
- No.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.861
He reached out to an arms dealer
I had on a watch list.

17:09.944 --> 17:13.574
He's got two priors and wants
to avoid a third, which is a problem

17:13.656 --> 17:17.703
because we just caught him
with 10,000 rounds of military-grade ammo.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.122
Jack DeLeon. Yeah, I heard about it.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.165
Castle is the buyer.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.334
I guess he needs bullets
for all those guns he stole

17:24.417 --> 17:25.417
from the Greeks.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.422
I guess you made DeLeon
an offer he can't refuse?

17:28.505 --> 17:30.049
Horse's head and all.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.885
He'll walk into the meet with Castle,
and we will be right behind him.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.304
So, when do we go?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.265
We wait for Castle to set the meet.

17:38.890 --> 17:42.103
- I might just have to kiss you.
- Don't. You're not my type.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.938
Oh, that's right. You like 'em pretty.

17:45.021 --> 17:47.649
You have no idea how I like them.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.861
That was a joke, until your reaction...

17:50.944 --> 17:54.531
which may have just given you away?

17:55.157 --> 17:57.785
You know, you need me to sit
with His Prettiness...

17:58.034 --> 18:01.247
check to make sure his intentions
are honorable, just let me know.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.498
- Sam?
- Yeah?

18:02.581 --> 18:03.915
Get out of my office.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.433
Hey. Thought I'd save you the job.
I hope you don't mind.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.685
No. Hey, I could, uh...

18:23.769 --> 18:25.604
I could make you a whole list
if you want.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.273
Okay.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.909
God damn it!

18:41.245 --> 18:44.540
I'm gonna go open another bottle.

18:44.623 --> 18:48.210
- Are you gonna make me drink alone?
- More of the, uh, pink stuff, huh?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.007
Thank you.

18:54.090 --> 18:56.635
You know what I miss the most?

18:56.718 --> 19:00.264
David used to, um, grab my keys...

19:01.182 --> 19:03.392
and just disappear for, like, 20 minutes.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.145
Every Sunday night. Wouldn't say a word.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.566
And I knew that he was going
to fill up my car tank.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.694
Because he knew how much
I hated going to the gas station,

19:13.777 --> 19:16.322
and he just took care of it.

19:17.989 --> 19:20.159
You never talk about your wife.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.538
Yeah, she's a...
She was a special woman. Okay?

19:25.872 --> 19:27.249
And she's gone now.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.212
That's... That's not gonna change.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.089
So what do we do? People like us.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.635
I mean, we still have
half of our lives to live, right?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.224
I think... I think about that.
I think about it a lot now.

19:43.307 --> 19:48.270
I mean, I... I see a couple walking
down the street, holding hands,

19:48.354 --> 19:51.232
and I think to myself,
"Will I ever have that again?"

19:51.940 --> 19:54.025
So does that mean that I've moved on?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.405
And if so, does that make me a bad person?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.496
You're a really good listener, Pete.
You know that?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.124
Mostly because you don't say anything.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.089
Look, I just...

20:17.591 --> 20:20.511
I don't know.
I think you're too hard on yourself.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.554
You blame yourself,
and this isn't your fault.

20:22.638 --> 20:26.266
You just... You feel guilty,
and I don't think that that helps you.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.063
You should allow yourself
to feel what you feel.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.070
You want to stay for some food?

20:38.153 --> 20:42.741
I got a refrigerator full of enchiladas
that are delicious.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.453
- Listen, I'd love to, but I...
- Oh, you got things to do.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.079
- Right?
- I do. Yeah.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.166
You know, maybe you could make me
a, uh... a plate to go, huh?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
Okay.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.797
Got... Oh, I got a thing right here.

20:58.214 --> 21:01.343
Well, thank you, um, for coming over.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.305
This really, uh...
This really meant a lot to me.

21:04.388 --> 21:09.142
Um, I enjoyed... this.

21:09.225 --> 21:10.225
Me, too.

21:15.732 --> 21:16.733
Yeah.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.200
Okay. Hey...

21:25.284 --> 21:28.203
- Hey, I just... I just...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:30.246 --> 21:32.165
Whoa, that was... that was weird.

21:32.999 --> 21:34.000
Sarah, look, um...

21:36.086 --> 21:37.421
I'm flattered, you know?

21:37.504 --> 21:40.590
- I am, but I can't...
- Yeah, well... well, you should be. Uh...

21:40.674 --> 21:42.926
Second guy I've kissed in 15 years.

21:43.009 --> 21:46.179
- Oh, boy.
- I'm kidding. I mean, um... Wow.

21:46.263 --> 21:51.393
Uh, can this not be weird?
I think I just... I had a moment.

21:52.018 --> 21:54.813
- It's that damn rosé.
- Yeah. No, that is some strong shit.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.022
- Right?
- Yeah.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.240
- See you around.
- Okay.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.450
Thank you.

22:07.283 --> 22:08.952
Oh, don't forget your enchiladas.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.206
Thank you.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.192
Jesus Christ.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.654
- Hmm.
- I guess you saw that, huh?

22:46.364 --> 22:48.241
Why did you get her flowers?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.577
'Cause I needed an excuse
to be there, right?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.080
Peonies, huh?

22:54.164 --> 22:55.457
- Yeah.
- Huh.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.376
Maria's favorite, so...

22:57.459 --> 23:01.129
Sarah's favorite, too, I guess.
Who knew?

23:04.716 --> 23:09.096
- I brought you these. They're, uh...
- I know what they are. Thanks, Frank.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.766
I really love these things.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.309
You know, I don't, uh...

23:16.394 --> 23:20.231
I don't blame you for kissing her.
She's a beautiful woman.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.818
And, uh...

23:26.154 --> 23:28.990
I don't blame her, either. I don't.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.743
- That's how we're dealing with this, huh?
- Mmm.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.497
This is how
I'm dealing with this.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.977
Look at this.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.437
Industry.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.859
Coal, iron, steel. Real things.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.529
Whole country used to be built on it.
We were self-sufficient.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.322
Now?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.616
Markets rule everything.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.078
This country never needed anything
from anyone else.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.999
- Now, we're beholden.
- Kinda like me and you.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.128
Yes. Like me and you.

24:26.422 --> 24:29.300
- You heard the tape.
- That's why we're here.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.387
We have to go after Castle.
He's the last witness.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.891
And get in the middle
of a government operation? Hell of a risk.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.269
Risky is him being captured
and talking about Kandahar

24:39.352 --> 24:41.563
to save himself from a lifetime in prison.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.567
We both have ambitions to protect, Billy.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.028
We go after him now,
we're exposed on that bug.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.783
- We lose our intelligence on Homeland.
- Everything checks out.

24:52.866 --> 24:56.703
Jack DeLeon is in custody.
They're planning an operation.

24:56.787 --> 24:59.080
As soon as they file the details,
I'll have them.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.667
It's a chance we must take.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.463
We go after him again,
I can't use anybody on my payroll.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.507
I lost nine of my guys
going after Henderson in those woods.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.595
I'mma need outside operators,
and they will not be cheap.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.056
Guess everything comes down
to money, doesn't it?

25:16.139 --> 25:19.434
Easy to say for a guy who never
worried about money a day in his life.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.311
I pay you well.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.021
You think that makes you better
than me?

25:23.104 --> 25:26.024
Who cares what other people think
about us?

25:27.317 --> 25:29.485
Pride is a weakness.

25:30.821 --> 25:31.988
Find your men, Billy.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.741
And the minute Homeland files
a tactical plan,

25:34.825 --> 25:36.534
I'll have it in your hands.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.915
Do you care about Madani?
Is that what this is about?

25:41.998 --> 25:43.917
She's a means to an end.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.420
Good. I thought perhaps you were worried
about going against her.

25:48.463 --> 25:53.218
There is no one on this green earth
that I'm worried about going against.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.722
We clear on that?

26:04.688 --> 26:08.274
I'm expecting our targets
to come in armed and ready to fight.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.612
They believe they are there
to capture a dangerous enemy.

26:11.695 --> 26:16.282
When they find us waiting instead,
I don't expect them to come quietly.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.159
Okay?

26:18.243 --> 26:21.204
Schematics and assignments
are in the folders before you.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.040
Study them and get ready.

26:24.791 --> 26:29.212
There will not, I repeat, not be a copy
of this tactical plan online

26:29.295 --> 26:32.340
or anywhere else
except right in front of you.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.469
They're all set.

26:36.552 --> 26:40.140
We'll get into position early
and see who turns up looking for Castle.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.225
The fake tactical plan is good to go.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.604
Now, you're sure we need to put this
into the system?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.107
If someone has a bug in my office,

26:49.190 --> 26:51.651
we can assume
they're in our computers, too.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.164
You always have a guitar
on deployment.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.374
Sit around, you know...

27:08.459 --> 27:13.006
you got time to, uh, you know,
learn new songs, come up with new shit.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.218
That's how I met my wife.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.930
It was at a...

27:21.264 --> 27:23.641
At a park on a sunny day, you know?

27:24.976 --> 27:28.063
I was there with my guitar.
I'm sitting under the tree like a...

27:28.146 --> 27:29.731
Like a derelict. You know?

27:30.940 --> 27:34.402
Trying to learn this... this new song.

27:34.569 --> 27:39.157
I'm struggling, you know?
Struggling away with it.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.241
I'm even...

27:40.825 --> 27:43.286
I'm singing out loud
like an asshole, you know?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.583
And then I see her.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.169
She smiled at me.

27:52.128 --> 27:57.383
Yeah. Oh, I was done, man.
She... Oh, she...

27:57.467 --> 27:58.634
She had me.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.683
She says to me, "Hey, buddy, you, uh...
You know anything else?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.478
Because we're sick
of hearing you butcher this one."

28:09.520 --> 28:12.523
That's what she said, you know?

28:12.607 --> 28:13.608
I...

28:15.526 --> 28:19.322
I go beet red, you know? And I look up,
and I see this gang of her friends.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.450
And they're all laughing their asses off.

28:22.951 --> 28:27.413
- So you beat the shit out of 'em all.
- No, asshole, I didn't.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.498
I, uh...

28:29.332 --> 28:31.543
I told her
that I didn't do requests, and...

28:32.001 --> 28:33.962
if she wanted one, it was gonna cost her.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.298
That's a good line.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.885
Yeah, thank you.
I was actually pretty proud of myself,

28:39.968 --> 28:42.553
- given the circumstances.
- Mmm.

28:46.682 --> 28:47.976
Shit.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.603
That's really sweet.

28:50.686 --> 28:53.857
Yeah, well... changed my whole life.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.527
Come here. What about you?

28:58.403 --> 29:01.364
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

29:01.447 --> 29:02.615
Junior year.

29:02.698 --> 29:06.161
I'm taking History of the French Novel.
Sarah's in my class.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.831
Now, you gotta remember I'm a bit
of a player at this point in my life.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.750
But for some reason,

29:11.833 --> 29:17.297
Sarah's just... aloof.
For me, no way. Unapproachable.

29:18.799 --> 29:25.096
One night, I find myself at this wild,
like, costume party. I'm a Popsicle.

29:26.264 --> 29:31.519
There's Sarah. Um...
And everybody's wasted. She's trashed.

29:31.602 --> 29:35.731
So, I work up the nerve...

29:35.816 --> 29:37.733
and, uh, I talk to her.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.486
Get her while she's drunk.
That's... That is classy.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.323
No. Yeah. Yeah, but no.

29:43.406 --> 29:47.327
Turns out she was just...
She was just shy.

29:47.911 --> 29:51.372
So we're talkin', go back to her place

29:51.456 --> 29:54.459
and we're both waiting for the other one
to make the move, you know?

29:55.085 --> 29:59.798
And hours go by, and we're just talking
and eating toast, and so much toast.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.800
And finally, like, 5:00 in the morning...

30:04.177 --> 30:05.345
she kisses me.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.933
- We've been together ever since.
- Mmm.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.062
Yeah.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.398
When you know, you know.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.150
Mm-hmm.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.445
When you know, you know.

30:22.528 --> 30:23.571
That's it.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.657
Mmm.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.164
You miss sex?

30:35.625 --> 30:36.626
Hmm?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.087
Do you miss sex?

30:39.170 --> 30:42.340
Uh...
What do you want me to say?

30:42.423 --> 30:45.844
Because for me, I miss sex.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.804
Yeah, that's good to know, buddy.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.224
- You wanna hear something funny?
- What's that?

30:51.307 --> 30:54.185
- I'm hung like a moose.
- Jesus Christ.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.354
Oh, you think I'm kidding?

30:56.437 --> 30:59.858
Frank, I'm weirdly, seriously,
really well-endowed.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.735
Uh... you must be proud.

31:02.818 --> 31:06.281
Kinda spooky.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.074
- All right, you laugh.
- Yeah.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.367
You laugh...

31:10.201 --> 31:12.037
Oh, for Christ's sake. Get out of here.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.597
What's the matter with you?

31:13.621 --> 31:15.206
What are you doing?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.749
I'm just letting you know...

31:16.833 --> 31:18.668
it's not gonna be easy
to steal my wife.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.504
Oh, for Christ's sake.
That's in your head. Go away from me.

31:21.587 --> 31:25.550
You an ass man, Frank? You like,
like, a little... a high and tight one?

31:25.633 --> 31:27.760
Like 'em nice and fat?

31:27.843 --> 31:29.321
- You've lost your mind.
- Juicy?

31:29.345 --> 31:33.266
You like the, uh, heart-shaped?

31:33.349 --> 31:36.311
Don't do that. What are you paintin' me
with the ass brush for?

31:36.394 --> 31:39.480
- You kissed my wife, don't forget.
- Oh, stop. Enough, all right?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.708
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
- That's not what happened.

31:41.732 --> 31:45.736
It's okay. If she wasn't gonna kiss you,
it'd be somebody else.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.449
- Seriously, it's okay. She's a very...
- All right.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.492
Sarah's a very sensual woman.

31:52.743 --> 31:53.912
I'll be right back.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.376
Wait a second.

32:05.506 --> 32:06.757
Wait a second.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.469
Madani.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.389
- Yeah, Madani.
- What do you mean, "Madani"? What?

32:13.473 --> 32:15.742
- That's how we fix...
- Gonna start talking about her ass?

32:15.766 --> 32:17.852
That's how we fix this.
That's how we fix this.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.687
We've been hiding from her
this whole time.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.983
We don't need to hide from her.
She wants the same things that we do.

32:24.150 --> 32:28.404
I have the video. You are the eyewitness.
Don't you see? We give that to her.

32:28.488 --> 32:33.576
Lock and key. Lock and key. We give that
to Madani, she arrests Rawlins...

32:33.659 --> 32:35.703
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I go home. Boom!

32:35.786 --> 32:37.872
- Stop that shit.
- I make sweet love with my wife.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.416
- Stop that shit. Stop that shit.
- What?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.502
Rawlins dies, remember?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.089
Oh, that's right. Everybody dies.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.172
- You're goddamn right.
- Yeah, that is right, huh?

32:48.216 --> 32:49.342
- Yeah.
- Your family's dead.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.636
Anyone that ever looked at you sideways,
they're dead.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.138
And you just keep on going, huh?
You just keep on going.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.098
You're a psychopath.

32:55.181 --> 32:58.601
That's right. Yeah.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.521
You done?

33:05.108 --> 33:07.068
You have nothing but a war inside you.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.363
I'm calling her.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.889
- Put the phone down.
- I'm calling Madani.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.790
Put the goddamn phone down!

33:25.753 --> 33:27.047
Put the phone down.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.784
We not welcome
at the office anymore, Billy?

33:57.743 --> 33:58.953
Somethin' like that.

34:02.957 --> 34:06.127
I thought it best we not be seen together
after the last time.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.963
Well, what went down was bullshit.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.757
We did what you paid us to do.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.052
It's what the State Department
paid you to do.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.263
Which was to protect certain diplomats
from harm.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.099
Still alive, aren't they?

34:19.681 --> 34:22.060
You shot the wrong people
in front of the wrong people.

34:22.851 --> 34:24.770
Ain't a contractor
that'll touch us right now.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.813
I can't get a gig anywhere.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.067
Listen, there's not much
of anything I can do

34:29.150 --> 34:32.904
about a YouTube video of you guys
opening up on a bunch of Iraqi civilians.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.239
And nothing I can do about State coming...

34:35.322 --> 34:36.532
What can you do?

34:43.539 --> 34:44.581
An op.

34:45.916 --> 34:48.543
Blacked out. Search and destroy.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.838
Total deniability.

34:52.547 --> 34:53.841
Right here in the city.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.386
And I'll be leading it myself.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.138
How does that help us with State?

35:00.640 --> 35:03.351
It doesn't.
But the big fat checks you'll be getting

35:03.434 --> 35:05.853
will help get you to a country
with no extradition.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.439
And I'll help arrange safe passage.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.484
How fat are the checks?

35:13.611 --> 35:16.156
Five hundred grand. Each.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.324
Half now, half on completion.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.620
Somebody must really need someone dead.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.290
Somebody always does.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.466
No.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.469
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
My head's gonna explode.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.013
- Oh, my God.
- Eat that.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.395
Frank, can you please forget everything
I said last night?

35:48.646 --> 35:51.023
- With the exception of Madani.
- Hey.

35:52.608 --> 35:56.111
Forget Madani, okay?
We're not going to Madani. Is that clear?

35:57.947 --> 35:59.282
Eat that. It'll help.

36:00.700 --> 36:04.204
It's got fermented rice.
It's full of probiotics.

36:04.870 --> 36:09.375
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- Don't thank me. Thank the Vietnamese.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.047
- Did you hit me?
- Just once.

36:15.130 --> 36:16.174
Ah.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.010
Where'd you get this?

36:20.970 --> 36:23.223
- I made it.
- Mmm.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.726
Wow. This is amazing.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.354
I didn't know you could cook.

36:30.646 --> 36:32.565
There's a lot you don't know about me.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.321
Here.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.740
That'll help, too.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.786
Your wife.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.418
Should I answer that?
Should I answer it or not?

36:53.043 --> 36:54.128
It's your girlfriend.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.426
I'm only gonna say this once, okay?

37:02.428 --> 37:05.765
I was with Maria for three months
when she got pregnant with Lisa.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.017
She said that she was not giving her up.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.268
Didn't wanna raise her alone,

37:09.352 --> 37:11.163
but she understood
if I didn't wanna hang around.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.022
I asked her to marry me that day.

37:13.523 --> 37:17.192
Now I had friends who said I was crazy,
that I'd lost my mind.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.153
But we were together ever since.

37:19.237 --> 37:23.324
Now, sure, we... we had problems,
but I never wanted to be

37:23.408 --> 37:24.568
- with anyone else.
- Right...

37:24.617 --> 37:26.737
Why don't you shut your mouth
and listen for a change?

37:27.119 --> 37:28.496
I don't want your wife.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.122
You got it?

37:32.833 --> 37:33.834
Good.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.634
Hey, Pete, it's Sarah.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.303
Um, I'm really sorry to bother you.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.764
I don't mean to interrupt you if you're
in the middle of something, um...

37:46.847 --> 37:48.974
I'm just really worried. It's Zach.

37:49.934 --> 37:53.187
I think he's planning to hurt someone.
And anyway, um,

37:53.271 --> 37:55.565
if you could call me back,
I would really appreciate it.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.276
Okay. Thanks.

37:59.985 --> 38:01.111
Yeah...

38:05.533 --> 38:07.702
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.704
- Um, thank you for coming.
- Yeah.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.664
You all right?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.374
Come on in.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.836
What's going on?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.423
I want to show you something.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.142
I, uh... I found this in Zach's backpack.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.937
Hmm.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.942
He just... He has not been the same
since David died.

38:41.151 --> 38:42.945
Uh, he... he...

38:43.028 --> 38:46.949
He smacked his sister
not too long ago. He's...

38:49.327 --> 38:54.039
The poor kid is angry all the time.
He's got this crazy temper.

38:54.123 --> 38:59.211
He stole a skateboard from our neighbor.
And now... now this? I just...

39:00.630 --> 39:03.383
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.467
Okay.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.887
Why don't you go get him, huh?

39:08.178 --> 39:10.431
And maybe you... you go take a walk.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:16.270 --> 39:17.522
- Thank you.
- Hey...

39:54.517 --> 39:55.560
Cool shirt.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.607
Never much into hip-hop, but Wu-Tang...

40:02.274 --> 40:03.901
That's that next-level shit.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.625
You don't really care
about what I have to say, do you?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.878
Nah. That's all right.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.464
When I was your age,
I probably wouldn't care

40:25.548 --> 40:26.828
about what I had to say, either.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.969
Yeah, I was a real prick asshole
just like you.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.763
Only child.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.976
My parents were basically senior citizens.
They couldn't control me.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.772
No, all I wanted to do was...
I wanted to hurt people.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.067
And I did. I hurt people.
Is that what you want?

40:48.028 --> 40:49.028
Move.

41:08.090 --> 41:12.928
I gotta tell you,
I do approve of your choice of weapons.

41:13.012 --> 41:17.141
What you picked, that's called a KA-BAR.
It's a Marine's best friend.

41:17.224 --> 41:22.229
You know, up close,
I'd rather have this than any firearm.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.150
You see, with a gun,
the target can get lucky.

41:26.233 --> 41:29.028
A bullet can miss what's important.
But not with this.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.740
You slide it in, you guide it through...

41:33.741 --> 41:36.494
and you rip right into the parts of a man
that make him dead.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.620
There's no luck in that.

41:38.788 --> 41:41.666
From where you're sitting right now,
say you had a gun.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.710
You could be locked and loaded,
and I'd still rather be me.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.129
I could close the distance.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.089
No!

41:49.173 --> 41:52.885
Cut that little head of yours clean off
before you'd ever get a shot.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.845
You feel tough now? Huh?

41:55.930 --> 41:59.099
Do it. Do it.

42:00.809 --> 42:02.728
I wanted the knife because I'm scared.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.480
I don't even have any more friends.

42:06.982 --> 42:09.151
I just wanted...

42:11.403 --> 42:14.239
It feels bad. All the time.

42:15.157 --> 42:16.784
Maybe I wanted them to feel bad.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.578
Just once.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.871
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.497
That's it.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.917
Okay, okay, okay.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.001
I'm sorry.

42:28.921 --> 42:29.922
I'm sorry.

43:20.973 --> 43:23.601
Homeland Security!
Drop your weapons!

43:24.768 --> 43:26.048
Shit.

43:30.357 --> 43:31.609
Behind us!

43:48.000 --> 43:50.753
Drop your weapons
and get down on the ground!

43:59.720 --> 44:01.347
Who the hell are these guys?

44:05.601 --> 44:07.561
What do we do?

44:07.645 --> 44:09.125
- Take 'em down.
- Down!

44:21.325 --> 44:22.868
Move! Move! Move!

44:28.290 --> 44:30.584
Pruitt's down!

44:37.424 --> 44:38.467
Cover me.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.554
They got Bashille!

44:42.637 --> 44:45.349
- Shit.
- You have nowhere to go!

44:54.483 --> 44:57.694
- Stein, flank and get behind them.
- Cover me.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.204
Fall back!

45:18.966 --> 45:22.177
Wait! Come back! No! No!

45:39.569 --> 45:41.321
Stein, we've got a runner
on the east side.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.864
Drop it! I said drop it!

46:25.449 --> 46:28.953
You know what? Don't! I'd love the excuse.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.707
Hands behind your head.

46:34.458 --> 46:35.792
Hands behind your head!

46:36.668 --> 46:37.711
On your knees.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.005
Get on your knees!

46:45.719 --> 46:49.181
Move an inch, asshole, and I will
gladly shoot you in the goddamn face.

46:59.774 --> 47:01.110
Who's pretty now?

47:20.045 --> 47:21.463
Federal agent down.

47:21.546 --> 47:24.133
We need EMT, right now.

47:25.968 --> 47:29.930
Federal agent down.
We need EMT, right now.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.268
Federal agent down. Federal agent down.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.020
Sam?

47:37.187 --> 47:39.273
Sam.

47:39.356 --> 47:44.069
You're gonna be okay.
Stay with me. Please.

47:44.153 --> 47:47.907
Help! Hey, it's okay. Stay with me.

47:47.990 --> 47:49.616
Stay with me, Sam.

47:49.699 --> 47:52.286
Come on. Come on! Help!

47:52.369 --> 47:55.705
Help! Sam...

47:56.290 --> 48:00.169
I need you...
I need you to be strong for me now, okay?

48:00.252 --> 48:03.005
Someone help me!

48:03.088 --> 48:05.049
Please. Please...

48:09.553 --> 48:11.471
No, no...

48:11.555 --> 48:14.433
Oh! No.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.147
Attaboy.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.945
- Sweet spiral.
- My man.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.114
Good throw.

48:31.408 --> 48:32.743
There it is.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.996
- Nice.
- Oh! Oh.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.247
Sorry.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.832
Yeah, don't worry about that.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.505
Why don't you go long, buddy?

48:50.177 --> 48:51.261
You kidding me?

48:51.845 --> 48:54.014
- Are you kidding me?
- He needs me, Frank.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.890
Get the hell outta here.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.101
Hey, listen to me.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.562
You wanna get him killed?
Is that what you wanna do?

49:00.937 --> 49:03.107
He's a little baby. He needs me.

49:03.773 --> 49:05.359
Want me to go to Madani, I'll go.

49:05.442 --> 49:07.277
I'll do whatever it takes.
But you gotta go.

49:09.863 --> 49:10.864
They'll kill him.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.369
David, they will kill him. Go.
Go.

49:19.248 --> 49:20.457
Cover your ass up.

49:25.129 --> 49:28.882
- Who was that?
- Nah. Just some guy.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.969
I told him not to hang out around here.

49:32.386 --> 49:33.803
- Let's play.
- My man.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.308
Hey, what a catch! Attaboy.
