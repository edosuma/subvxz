WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.534
FARGO: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.046
Sheriff Jack Carter,
Tess Fontana.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.207
Tess and I
are old friends.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.671
You're the new head
of Section Five?

00:08.800 --> 00:09.835
Hi.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.345
LEXI: Look, Duncan,
how well do we really
know each other?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.754
You know, our hopes,
our dreams,

00:14.890 --> 00:17.848
our reactions to surprises?

00:19.019 --> 00:21.806
I think I'm gonna have
to think about this.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.393
You and Henry are
working on something.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.892
It's the signal, isn't it?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.894
I think you're gonna
need all the help
that you can get.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.020
Henry, what are you saying?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.533
I'm saying that there's
something out there,

00:33.659 --> 00:35.069
and it's heading
straight for us.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.908
Straight for Eureka.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.825
What's all this?

00:44.962 --> 00:46.793
Oh, we're making
a baby book
for the boys.

00:46.922 --> 00:47.832
Oh.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.375
Smile, Uncle Jack.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.873
Thanks for that.
SARAH, print.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.046
SARAH: I'd be happy
to maintain
a virtual album

00:54.179 --> 00:56.591
with holographic
growth charts
and captured sound.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.712
(BABY CRYING)

00:57.849 --> 01:02.434
Uh, that's okay, SARAH.
Some things are better
the old-fashioned way.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.807
So, any word
from Duncan?

01:04.940 --> 01:07.602
Dad.
What? No,
it's okay, Zoe.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.986
Now, he's probably
halfway across the world,

01:10.112 --> 01:11.397
curing disease
where he belongs,

01:11.530 --> 01:14.522
which is why I didn't
tell him I was pregnant
to begin with.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.444
I'm sorry, Aunt Lex,
I really didn't mean
to pressure you.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.863
| just thought
you guys would
work it out.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.076
No, Zoe,
it's not your fault.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.445
Life is...

01:21.957 --> 01:23.913
lt's messy sometimes.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.582
Is it?
Here we go.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.917
So, everything's my fault?

01:27.045 --> 01:28.876
No, not everything.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.543
Look, Jack,
even when we were kids,
you never took my side.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.256
Lex, cut the guy some slack.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.296
I mean, you lied
to him for months,
then you took off.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.512
He didn't have
the chance to do
the right thing.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.228
Yes. Life is messy.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.644
But this isn't
how you clean it up.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.689
He doesn't want this. I do.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.103
So I'm moving on.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.448
I got to get dressed.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.533
Are you okay?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.072
I'm fine.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.287
Okay.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.469
(SIGHS)

02:20.015 --> 02:21.050
Moving on.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.855
Uh, so what's
this all about?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.727
Just waiting for
the aliens to land.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.853
Seriously?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.491
Mmm-hmm. Actually,
it's our turn to host,

02:38.617 --> 02:39.823
'cause we went
there last year.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.816
Um... There being?

02:41.953 --> 02:44.569
Area 51,
Eureka's arch rivals.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.448
Our annual bowling match
goes back nearly 50 years.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.915
Bowling, that sounds
pretty intense.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.784
You have no idea.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.293
So, Area 51,
that's UFO guys, right?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.916
Wrong. They got
the alien rep after
a surveillance balloon

02:58.053 --> 02:59.884
crashed in 1947,
never lived it down.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.049
Which is why
we love to rub it in.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.547
Totally throws off
their game.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.890
(LAUGHS)

03:05.936 --> 03:07.927
BISMARK: Well, well, well.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.766
Hello, Fargo.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.639
Hello, Bismark.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.232
(SNIFFING)

03:14.361 --> 03:16.067
Mmm, what is that odor?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.816
Ah, the smell of fear.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.281
The only thing scary
about you is your breath.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.071
Ready to lose
for the fifth year running?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.909
Did you bring
your little green men
to help you?

03:25.038 --> 03:25.788
Oh, I'll show you
little green men.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.202
Easy, ladies. Let's try
to keep the competition
friendly, okay?

03:29.334 --> 03:31.165
Well, it's hardly
a competition, Sheriff.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.831
Your little team here
doesn't stand a chance.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.046
You haven't met
our secret weapon.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.916
Hey, Big Ed,
come out and say hi.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.087
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

03:43.724 --> 03:47.012
Big Ed Fowler,
the former PBA champion?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.810
He also happens
to be a very
gifted biochemist.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.854
Bowling's more of a hobby.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.775
Well, there's no way.
This is a complete
violation of the rules.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.898
You can't just
bring in a ringer
from the outside.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.411
Rules state
anybody employed
here can play.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.118
Read 'em and weep.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.247
Still time to beam back
to the mother ship.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.536
Bring it, Fargo.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.876
Oh, it's been brung,
Bismark.
Nice English.

04:15.005 --> 04:15.790
Yeah, nice face.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:15.922 --> 04:17.628
All right, stop.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.083
All right, I got to go,
but both of you, behave.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.139
(GRUNTING)

04:25.932 --> 04:27.672
(JOINTS CRACKING)

04:28.727 --> 04:29.716
(EXHALES)

04:32.814 --> 04:33.849
Hey, Al.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.019
Finally. What, did you
come by pack mule?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.642
Nice to see you, too, Tess.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.270
Sorry, but
time-sensitive issue.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.113
We need your help
collecting all the
Globidium in Eureka.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.743
Uh... All the what?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.279
Globidium, it's
a nuclear element,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.118
artificially created
here at Global.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.953
It's much safer
than plutonium,

04:51.082 --> 04:52.947
with 10 times
the energy output.

04:53.084 --> 04:53.994
Mmm. Then why the recall?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.368
Globidium's been field-tested
in town for years,

04:56.505 --> 04:58.211
but we need to get it back
for a new project.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.830
Not everyone is complying.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.877
And we were hoping
that you could
persuade them

05:02.010 --> 05:04.752
using your inimitable
Andy Griffith charm.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.886
You know what?
You have the
unique ability

05:07.015 --> 05:08.721
to make a compliment
sound insulting.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.930
Who said that was
a compliment?

05:10.060 --> 05:13.097
Okay, stop.
I really need
your help, Carter.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.471
Well, in the meantime,
it's artificial.
Can't you make some more?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.393
Yeah, we could,
if we had six months,
but we don't.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.606
We need to move quickly.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.943
Oh. This has
something to do with
the signal from space.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.107
You told him?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.606
(LAUGHS) No,
but you just did.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.650
Yeah, you think
you're clever.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.867
Uh, yes, lam.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.907
So, when are
the little green men
coming to Eureka?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.826
I'm sorry.
I can't share the details.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.415
But you and I shared
an alternate universe.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.375
Does that not mean
anything to you?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.540
Just get to
that list, Sheriff.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.129
All right.
Okay?

05:42.008 --> 05:42.838
Wait, I'm on this list!

05:42.968 --> 05:46.836
The Smart House reactor
runs on Globidium,
so we'll need yours, too.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.633
Is that a problem?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.721
Uh, no. No. Um...

05:51.309 --> 05:52.810
SARAH might have
an issue with it.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.934
HENRY: Well, you don't
have to worry about SARAH.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.850
I mean, she can be adapted
to alternate fuel sources.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.395
CARTER: Yeah, well,
she doesn't like change,
and neither do I.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.983
lnoﬂced.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.898
Meaning?

06:05.448 --> 06:08.406
Tess Fontana.
I mean, she gets
under your skin.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.275
Yeah, just a bit.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.573
Uh, don't look now,
but I think our
first customer

06:12.706 --> 06:13.946
is trying to make
a fast getaway.

06:14.082 --> 06:14.867
Seth!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.661
HENRY: Clean
Globidium mobile.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.953
l'll return
the power cell tomorrow.

06:18.086 --> 06:18.996
I got a hot date
tonight, okay?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.118
She loves the car.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.588
Well, she's just got
to love you for you.
Pop the hood, Henry.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.420
Come on, Sheriff.
| just had this
cleaned professionally,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.339
inside and out.
You could eat
off that engine.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.133
Uh, it's not here.
The reactor is empty.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.348
All right, Seth,
give it back.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.062
Whoa, I'm the victim here.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.977
Really? Then why
were you trying
to get away?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.270
In a car with
no power cell?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.018
How dumb do
you think I am?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.611
Well...
Hey!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.037
MAN: Yeah!

07:26.947 --> 07:27.982
You mess with
your own balls
all you want,

07:28.114 --> 07:29.979
but you can't
mess with ours.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.732
(EXCLAIMS) Somebody
can't take a joke.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.279
Fargo, l have
one word for you.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.073
Is it "surrender"?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.241
No.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.993
lt's "truce."

07:41.086 --> 07:42.576
We're above this pettiness,

07:42.712 --> 07:43.827
so I'm gonna be
the bigger man here

07:43.964 --> 07:46.296
and propose that
we focus on the game.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.039
No more pranks.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.000
Deal?

07:51.638 --> 07:52.753
Deal.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.932
May the best team win.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.598
As long as they're human.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.429
(CHUCKLING)
Good one.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.769
BISMARK: Good game.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.854
(WHISPERING)
We're really
calling a truce?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.691
No way. I just
want to keep them
off their guard.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.856
That way they'll
never know what
hit them. Huh?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.399
(CHUCKLING) Oh!

08:12.033 --> 08:13.364
Uh...

08:16.413 --> 08:18.119
Oh, what the frak?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.863
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:21.835 --> 08:23.666
Osborne says that
his car was in the
driveway all night,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.786
so anyone could
have taken the
power cell from there.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.753
Yes, but Globidium
is a unique power source,

08:27.882 --> 08:29.622
and without it
our project won't
be ready in time.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.624
Oh, what project is that,
exacﬂy?

08:31.761 --> 08:33.922
The point is,
we need to find it.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.512
Okay. Do we need
to be worried
about health risks?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.757
Well, compared to elements
like plutonium, no,

08:38.893 --> 08:40.224
but if it should
be taken out of
the container,

08:40.353 --> 08:44.562
then we'd be looking
at moderate levels of
(DEVICE CRACKLING)

08:44.691 --> 08:45.931
radioactivity.

08:46.067 --> 08:46.977
Now, that's odd.

08:47.110 --> 08:52.355
I mean, it's picking up
a radioactive source
from somewhere.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.941
Sheriff Carter,
we demand action.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.414
I think they've taken
the little green men
thing a bit far.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.963
Uh, this is no joke.
They're radioactive.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.398
Those guys are crazy.
They're trying to kill us.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.991
Oh, you're gonna
be fine.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.109
They're gonna be fine,
aren't they?

09:40.246 --> 09:41.201
Yeah, they're
gonna be fine.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.411
I mean,
you have elevated levels

09:42.540 --> 09:46.158
of gamma radiation that
mutated the pigmentation
of your skin

09:46.294 --> 09:49.252
(LAUGHS) but it's
the equivalent of a sunburn.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.917
So, we're not gonna
turn into the Hulk?

09:52.050 --> 09:55.338
Only if you get
really, really angry.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.553
No. No, no, no,
don't worry, no.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.467
It'll be out
of your system
in a few days.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.840
Then we need to
get back to practice.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.389
No, no, we need
to get even.
Fargo smash!

10:05.522 --> 10:07.808
(GRUNTING)
No, Fargo will
not smash.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.603
All right? There will
be no getting even.
Understand?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.815
It's actually a pretty color.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.110
So, what could
have caused this?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.529
Could it be a
missing power cell,
courtesy of Area 51?

10:20.662 --> 10:21.651
On its own, no,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.449
but if it was
altered somehow,
it's possible.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.912
Well, I've worked
with these guys before.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.451
They're dorks,
but they're harmless.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.870
Well, we still need
to collect the remaining
power cells.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.834
All right.
You want to go with Jo,
I'll check out Bismark?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.044
Let's go.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.134
Don't be afraid
to use deadly force.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.627
(DOORBELL RINGS)
SARAH: There's a
visitor at the door.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.552
Ooh, maybe it's
the baby's crib.
SARAH, you can open the door.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.179
Duncan?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.147
Hello, Lex.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.232
SARAH: This is the Duncan?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.852
Uh, yeah, this is him.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.562
What is that?

10:57.699 --> 11:00.782
Oh, it's my house.
It's possessed.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.946
SARAH: Possessed of
a singular artificial
intelligence.

11:03.079 --> 11:03.909
SARAH, please.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.118
I thought you left town.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.909
No, I prefer to deal
with my problems.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.418
Hey, we're nobody's problems.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.375
Don't turn this
around on me, okay?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.836
You were the one
who took off without
saying a word.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.876
Well, you're the one
who freaked out
when I told you.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.920
That's 'cause of the way
you sprang it on me.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.510
I mean, kapow!
Looky here, twins,
right out of thin air.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.723
All right, you're right,
so maybe I panicked a little.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.091
A little?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.435
What? So, are you
telling me that you would
have reacted differently

11:29.564 --> 11:30.724
had I told
you in Cape Town?

11:30.857 --> 11:31.972
Yeah.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.020
Maybe. The point is,
I had a right to know.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.145
(SIGHS)

11:39.282 --> 11:40.271
You're right.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.357
You did.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.239
So, what do you
want to do now?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.078
What do you want to do?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.412
I want us to be honest
with each other.

11:52.212 --> 11:57.502
I mean, come on.
We had six crazy,
passionate months together,

11:58.176 --> 12:00.007
but this wasn't
in the cards.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.177
Life looks different
to me now.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.551
I'd give up anything
for these kids,

12:05.683 --> 12:07.548
but I don't expect you to.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.016
Isn't that my choice?

12:10.647 --> 12:11.682
No.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.062
Go back to your life,
Duncan.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.238
Please?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.444
That's what you really want?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.324
Yes.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.403
SARAH: You heard the lady.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.742
(SIGHS)

12:35.838 --> 12:37.374
Yeah!
There you go.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.965
Just picture Fargo's
fat face on the pins,
works every time.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.300
Bismark.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.261
Oh, hello, Sheriff.
How's Fargo?

12:46.474 --> 12:49.181
Green with envy,
orjust plain green?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.221
What did you do,
and how'd you do it?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.680
Camoscope, the future
of camouflage.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.101
lt emits gamma rays
into the skin,

12:56.234 --> 12:58.816
starting a chain reaction
that alters the pigmentation.

12:58.945 --> 13:03.689
Any chance you powered
it with a stolen bit
of... (STAMMERING)

13:03.825 --> 13:06.908
It's a nuclear
power cell thingy.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.288
We don't steal, we win.

13:09.414 --> 13:13.032
Still, you're taking
the prank thing a little far,
don't you think?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.544
As far as turning
a beloved mascot invisible,

13:15.670 --> 13:18.878
or planting a
bioengineered laxative
in a rival's talcum powder?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.338
Why would you do that?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.626
You guys did that,
last year in Area 51.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.717
Oh.

13:25.847 --> 13:30.090
Look, if you really
want to find your nuclear
power cell thingy, Sheriff,

13:30.977 --> 13:32.933
you might want
to talk to your
own team members,

13:33.062 --> 13:35.849
'cause they're the ones
that take things too far.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.027
For you.

13:44.115 --> 13:44.945
You're Lexi's niece,
right?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.234
Yeah. Zoe.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.449
You know,
your aunt can be
unbelievably stubborn.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.695
Yeah, and overprotective.
It runs in the family.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.407
What's with the
Green Man Group?

13:55.543 --> 13:58.751
Oh. My boyfriend's team
got punked by their rivals.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.290
It's probably
gamma radiation.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.914
I saw something similar
near a reactor in Siberia.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.962
The green's a nice touch.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.049
Do you know how to fix it?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.637
Well, lucky for you,
a good epidemiologist
always travels prepared.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.761
Vinspresso ice cream, anyone?

14:12.894 --> 14:15.431
Vincent, we don't
need ice cream,
we need payback!

14:15.563 --> 14:19.476
Oh, my! What are you,
green and deaf?
I said no payback.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.271
Of course, Sheriff.
We'll take the high road.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.392
It's a good idea.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.360
Stop sucking up, Lucas.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.072
Are you guys planning
any pranks involving
a nuclear power cell?

14:28.201 --> 14:31.284
We've dabbled in a little
combustion explosives,
but nothing nuclear.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.154
(WHISPERING) Lucas,
what part of "secret"
don't you understand?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.872
Hey. You almost done
with Tess' list?

14:37.001 --> 14:40.243
Uh, yeah, and Seth Osborne's
not the only one missing
a power cell.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.711
We have three more thefts.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.375
Of course we do.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.715
Can I offer you two
some ice cream
before it all melts?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.004
Uh, no, thank you.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.126
What's the problem?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.676
My freezer died
right after Area 51
showed up.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.720
Coincidence?
I think not.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.592
Well, don't be too sure.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.685
ls Cafe Diem on the list?

14:59.482 --> 15:00.597
Uh...

15:01.192 --> 15:04.104
Yeah. The freezer
runs off Globidium.
Globidium.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.649
And it was working
when Big Ed cleaned it
this morning.

15:07.782 --> 15:11.320
Now, Seth Osborne
said that he had his
car cleaned as well.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.819
Would Big Ed happen
to work in the
auto-detailing business?

15:14.956 --> 15:18.448
Well, sure. Big Ed
can clean anything.
I mean, that's his job.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.165
He's the cleaner.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.497
That's it,
all the Globidium cells
we've managed to collect.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.124
Well, the laser telescope
is gonna need
a lot more power

15:28.261 --> 15:31.924
if we're gonna get
a good look at that,
whatever it is.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.842
Is that what's
sending the signal?

15:33.975 --> 15:35.340
Yeah, it's the
best image we can get.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.888
The new telescope
will give us a much
higher resolution,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.636
but our atmospheric window
closes in 24 hours.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.482
Well, Carter will find
the stolen power cells.
Just give him some time.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.725
Okay.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.905
Is there anything, you know,
going on between you two?

15:52.118 --> 15:56.612
What? Oh, God. No!
I'm pregnant.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.534
Well, you know,
some guys are into that.
More of you to love.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.329
(LAUGHS) Okay, stop.
We're friends.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.248
Just... Just friends.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.005
If you say so.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.926
Okay. Thanks,
Principal Wallace.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.919
We'll let you know
when we find it.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.717
Let me guess.
She had Big Ed
clean something.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.638
A Globidium-powered barbecue
that's now missing
a power cell.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.510
Wow, looks like
the cleaner's dirty.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.263
Yeah, well, maybe
we'll get lucky
and he'll confess.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.061
It's just down here.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.951
Big Ed?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.080
Hello?

16:41.834 --> 16:42.823
I guess he stepped out.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.541
(SIGHS) Yeah.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.833
Or took off.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.588
(EXHALES) The missing
power cells.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.637
Should we be
worried about, you know,
radiation exposure?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.302
Well, I gotta...

17:00.853 --> 17:02.468
I got to say yes.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.764
(GASPS)

17:07.360 --> 17:09.521
JO: (EXCLAIMS lN DlSGUST)
Is that Big Ed?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.075
Not anymore.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.702
No radiation.
It's all good.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.579
Well, tell that to Big Ed.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.751
So, he just melted?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.499
Like a green popsicle
on a sunny day.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.625
Jo.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.548
Well, at least
you found the
missing Globidium.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.922
Well, Globidium couldn't
do this on its own.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.424
Could it react
to the stuff that
turned him green?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.847
Well, ifthe combo
generated the right
amount of radiation,

17:43.980 --> 17:45.891
it could mutate human cells.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.058
We need to talk
to Henry.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.397
All right.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.025
Theoretically,
it's possible.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.144
Uh, except
for one problem.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.647
These containers,
they're empty.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.528
What happened
to the Globidium?

17:58.661 --> 18:01.903
I don't know. I mean,
there's not a single
photon in any of them.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.245
As a matter of fact,

18:03.374 --> 18:06.741
there's a total
absence of radiation
in Big Ed's remains.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.866
Well, that's disturbing.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.711
Well, he is a big
puddle of goo.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.205
No, no, Carter,
I mean, on average

18:12.341 --> 18:15.003
we're all exposed to
0.2 rem of radiation
each year,

18:15.136 --> 18:17.798
which means, to some degree,
we're all radioactive.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.965
Oh, that's comforting.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.180
No, it's normal
and generally safe,

18:21.309 --> 18:23.425
though neither of
those words seem
to apply around here.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.846
Yeah, you get used to that.

18:24.979 --> 18:28.972
Henry, if Big Ed
was turned green
by radiation,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.474
shouldn't his levels
be even higher?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.693
One would expect,

18:33.821 --> 18:35.561
but it's like something
drained it out of him.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.029
Well, what about
the rest of the team?

18:37.158 --> 18:38.648
They've all been tested.
Everyone's fine.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.984
just to be on
the safe side.
Okay.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.866
You threatened my team
and liquefied
our secret weapon!

18:44.999 --> 18:47.615
This is blasphemy!
Okay? Madness!

18:47.752 --> 18:49.458
This is Eureka!

18:49.587 --> 18:50.793
Break it up.
What happened?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.298
Look, I have no idea, okay?
But we didn't do it.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.880
You did turn them green.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.341
I told you.
We fully tested
the camoscope.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.210
The effects are
completely superficial.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.467
any pranks, any other...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.556
When? We've been here
practicing all day.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.891
Ask anyone.
They'll tell you.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.510
Well, you've probably
been using

19:07.647 --> 19:09.558
alien mind control
on everybody here.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.645
Bite me, Kermit.

19:10.775 --> 19:11.935
CARTER: Guys!

19:13.152 --> 19:16.861
A man's dead. Okay?
Now, I need help.
You got it?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.735
Got it.
Got it.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.859
Great. Fargo,
you knew Big Ed.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.235
Any reason that
he'd want to stockpile

19:24.372 --> 19:25.487
a whole bunch
of Globibinum?

19:25.623 --> 19:26.658
Globidium.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.156
Don't push me.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.408
I don't know. Um...

19:30.544 --> 19:32.125
He usually kept to himself.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.496
I know he liked to clean,
and I think he had a pet.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.838
Okay. Bismark,
you want to keep Area 51 here
until further notice.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.507
Fargo, get your guys
to G.D. just in case.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.971
You mean, like,
in case we melt?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.055
Well, as long as
you guys are green,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.264
I'd like someone to
keep an eye on you.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.884
Yeah, I'll watch them.
Come on.
Thanks.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.477
And, remember,
no more pranks. Okay?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.937
(BEEPING)

19:52.733 --> 19:53.848
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

19:53.984 --> 19:55.770
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
MAN: Think you're cool now?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.018
WOMAN: How do you like that?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.735
Last one, I swear.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.197
What's in that stuff?
It reeks.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.412
(GROANS) Tell me about it.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.951
It's an organic
mineral mask

20:10.084 --> 20:12.541
made of herbs,
sea salt and
fruit extractions

20:12.670 --> 20:14.001
from around the world.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.837
It should leech the toxins
out of the skin.

| feel like a girl.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.966
Would you rather
stay green?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.052
Yeah, I didn't think so.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.008
I'll be right back.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.389
Smoothie?
Sure.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.602
VINCENT: Hey, can we
get Lexi's special?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.438
Aunt Lex, what's up?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.809
Oh, ljust came
to get a smoothie
before yoga, with Allison.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.238
What's Duncan
doing here?

20:43.701 --> 20:46.534
He's taking pity
on my green boyfriend.
I hope that's okay.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.827
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

20:48.956 --> 20:50.366
Because
I'm fraternizing
with the enemy

20:50.499 --> 20:51.534
for my own
selfish purposes.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.828
No, Duncan isn't the enemy.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.997
Besides, he's really good
at what he does.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.840
I should probably
go meet Allison.

21:01.969 --> 21:02.958
Here you go.
Thank you.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.837
Oh, and a decaf
Vinspresso ice cream.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.634
It's for Allison.
She's craving it.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.927
Thanks.
VINCENT: Yeah.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.344
Bye, Zo.

21:16.859 --> 21:17.974
Okay.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.983
Let's see what we got.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.072
Well?

21:30.539 --> 21:31.915
(SIGHS) Yay.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.997
Duncan, you're a genius.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.705
Can we fix
the rest of me now?

21:36.837 --> 21:40.079
lt's notjust you.
How much of this stuff
can we make?

21:43.135 --> 21:46.844
So, why would a cleaner
want to steal Globidium?

21:47.348 --> 21:50.306
Big Ed wasn't just a cleaner.
He was the cleaner.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.096
Clean rooms,
contamination control,
waste management.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.062
They're all essential
to the research that
we do here at Global.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.432
I heard a single
dust mite once got
into LEP at CERN,

21:59.568 --> 22:01.604
set them back six months.

22:02.404 --> 22:06.238
Okay. So, if dirty is bad,

22:06.367 --> 22:09.985
then would Ed have stolen
the cells to power, like,

22:10.120 --> 22:11.280
a nuclear vacuum?

22:11.413 --> 22:14.029
(SNICKERS)
l'm... lt...

22:14.166 --> 22:16.578
What Tess means is
that we have moved
well beyond that.

22:16.710 --> 22:20.043
Big Ed specialized
in bio-mediation
and using microorganisms

22:20.172 --> 22:24.131
to restore
a contaminated environment
back to its natural state.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.792
So, kind of like soap?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.217
(SNICKERS)

22:29.014 --> 22:30.129
What?

22:30.850 --> 22:31.839
(STAMMERS)

22:33.018 --> 22:34.804
Each organism
was created

22:34.937 --> 22:36.802
to clean a particular
metal or chemical,

22:36.939 --> 22:40.056
which makes it
perfect for cleaning up
industrial waste,

22:40.192 --> 22:41.898
oil spills and the like.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.019
Well, Big Ed's remains
were cleaned of radiation.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.022
Could he have had
an organism that did that?

22:55.958 --> 22:56.913
All right, everyone,

22:57.042 --> 22:59.203
you need to apply
the treatment
wherever you're green,

22:59.336 --> 23:01.497
so take off your clothes.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.962
Get naked here?

23:05.551 --> 23:08.634
You heard him.
You with me,
boys with Duncan.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.004
Relax, Doug,
nudity is perfectly
natural, all right?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.551
I've lived in places
in Africa

23:13.684 --> 23:15.891
where it's the custom
to go au naturel.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.261
Only for you.
I prefer privacy.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.731
Here it is.
"Big Ed bioengineered
a prototype

23:26.864 --> 23:31.324
"for a microorganism that
ingests gamma radiation
for nuclear waste cleanups."

23:31.452 --> 23:33.534
He even gave it
a nickname, Spot.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.653
As in remover,
I'm guessing.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.122
Yeah, well,
Fargo said that
Big Ed had a pet.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.458
Yeah, but all
| see here are
cleaning supplies.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.827
Yeah, and when
I went by his house,

23:42.963 --> 23:46.000
he didn't have
any food dishes
or litter boxes,

23:47.051 --> 23:50.009
but could this
pet project be his pet?

23:50.137 --> 23:52.219
Well, if it is,
pets need to be fed.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.009
Want to guess what Spot's
favorite food is?

23:54.141 --> 23:56.177
Globidium. No wonder
he's so far over budget.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.392
He used my power cells
as pet food?

23:58.520 --> 23:59.851
Yeah, well,
I mean, with you
collecting it all,

23:59.980 --> 24:01.311
it was either that
or let it starve.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.853
And if he ran out,
Spot might be after other
sources of gamma radiation.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.896
Like a green Big Ed.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.491
Okay, where is
this thing now?

24:14.036 --> 24:15.492
Looking for
its next meal.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.531
ln here?

24:16.664 --> 24:19.155
Well, it's not like
itjust could
open up a door.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.077
No.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.420
But there's
another way out.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.213
(GAGS)

24:39.436 --> 24:41.301
Man, this stuff stinks.

25:38.829 --> 25:39.818
ALLISON: Yes, General.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.037
I understand
your concern
about the signal.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.372
Hey, you ready?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.580
Yeah, one sec.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.122
Yes, sir.
I will schedule a call.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.120
Okay.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.746
(SIGHS)
Hey, partner,

25:50.883 --> 25:53.124
I got you a
little present
from Vincent.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.000
lt's ice cream.
It's a little melted.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.506
Mmm. lam so sorry.
I am going to have
to cancel yoga today.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.927
l have a situation
that l have to deal with.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.097
Okay. Um...

26:05.647 --> 26:07.478
I guess I'll just
see you next time.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.019
Hey, Lexi.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.309
Come on.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.401
(LAUGHS)

26:13.530 --> 26:14.645
You okay?

26:15.115 --> 26:17.356
Yes. No. l...

26:20.204 --> 26:21.944
Duncan's in town.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.537
Yes, I know. I met him.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.951
He's helping un-green
our bowling team.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.916
Yeah, he's good that way.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.081
He's good most ways,
actually.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.750
Mmm.
Too good.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.172
(CHUCKLING) You make that
sound like a bad thing.

26:34.301 --> 26:38.010
Oh, no, ljust...
I don't want him to change
because of me.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.928
Or them.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.593
Oh. Well, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

26:41.725 --> 26:45.388
Children definitely
change things,
but mostly for the better.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.428
You ever have
any regrets?

26:47.564 --> 26:49.850
Oh, about having them? No.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.975
I mean, it's hard
running this place
and being a parent,

26:53.779 --> 26:56.145
but is it worth it?
Absolutely.

26:56.824 --> 27:00.908
My only regret is
that Nathan isn't here
to share it with me.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.993
All right, I closed
the valves in the
main line into town,

27:07.126 --> 27:08.536
so that should
keep it contained
in the building.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.909
But if it went
down the drain,

27:10.045 --> 27:11.546
what's to stop it
from coming back up?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.378
Well, I think
| scared it, actually.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.623
I mean, when I came in,
itjumped off Fargo
in a hurry.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.717
Now, trust me, you're
not that intimidating.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.929
And single-celled
microorganisms
don't get scared.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.673
Well, it wasn't
so micro, actually,
and it was green.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.799
I mean, that can't be
a coincidence.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.597
Well, it might have
reacted with the
gamma radiation

27:27.729 --> 27:28.764
in Big Ed and mutated,

27:28.897 --> 27:32.185
but you know what?
I'm not detecting
any radiation signature.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.228
Well, that makes
it tough to track.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.148
Well, maybe,
instead of going after it

27:37.990 --> 27:39.025
we bring it to us.

27:39.158 --> 27:39.988
With what?

27:40.117 --> 27:41.197
Bait.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.530
Lexi.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.906
Duncan.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.078
Hey, I heard
what you did
for the team.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.452
Always helping people
wherever you go.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.000
Listen, can we talk?

27:56.633 --> 27:58.624
I don't think
there's anything
left to say.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.091
Lexi, why are you
pushing me away?

28:00.220 --> 28:03.804
Because there are
plenty of people out
there for you to save.

28:03.932 --> 28:04.967
I'm not one of them.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.467
I never thought you were.
If anything, you saved me.

28:09.396 --> 28:12.354
I'm sorry.
I'm late for class. Bye.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.612
We can't afford to lose
any more Globidium.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.982
Well, what we can't
afford to lose
is researchers.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.154
Oh, thanks,
way to make me
look selfish.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.994
What we need is a
sample large enough
to lure Spot out

28:28.123 --> 28:29.238
before he finds
another food source.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.035
And when he comes
out to eat...
We capture him.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.123
Done and done.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.708
Famous last words.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.624
What? Do you have
a better idea?

28:36.757 --> 28:37.963
You're pretty
sure of yourself,
aren't you?

28:38.091 --> 28:41.333
Well, yeah,
I mean, part of my
Andy Griffith charm.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.224
Oh, my God.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.017
What happened
to all my Globidium?

28:54.191 --> 28:57.149
God. I'm gonna
go out on a limb
and say that.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.064
I think Spot's
found another
food source.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.312
Come on.

29:05.702 --> 29:06.782
Back!

29:09.665 --> 29:10.745

29:11.124 --> 29:13.740
We're gonna need
a bigger container.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.966
We've got to contain it
to Section Five.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.707
Well, the entire level
is locked down.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.344
Well, that won't help
if it's traveling
through the pipes.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.006
Well, at least
it's trapped
in the building.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.049
No, for the moment,
but you saw what
it did to that door.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.171
It could pop up anywhere.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.889
The bigger it gets,
the more gamma
radiation it needs.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.475
We need to secure
any potential sources.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.014
I'll start to evacuate.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.182
Judging by its size,
it'll eat just about anything.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.103
Did you just look at me
when you said that?

29:42.239 --> 29:43.274
No!

29:44.032 --> 29:45.943
(STAMMERING) No, no!
l was... Ice cream!

29:46.076 --> 29:47.156
l was looking
at the ice cream.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.366
Ice... The cold.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.326
When Fargo was in
the shower, he bumped
into the faucet.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.037
I thought that l scared it,
but maybe it just doesn't
like the cold.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.872
So, what are you proposing?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.958
That we freeze it
in its tracks.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.743
Hmm.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.631
Hey! It's the
miracle worker!

30:03.760 --> 30:04.875
Thanks so much
for taking care of Lucas.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.378
Our prom pictures
would have sucked.

30:08.974 --> 30:09.884
Can I get a large
coffee to go?

30:10.017 --> 30:11.973
I've got a long drive
ahead of me.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.218
Wait. You're leaving?

30:15.731 --> 30:18.188
Well, your aunt's
made it perfectly clear
she doesn't want me here.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.356
So you travel halfway
across the world to see her,

30:20.485 --> 30:22.646
and then you
just give up?

30:22.779 --> 30:24.735
I can't make her talk to me.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.401
Well, you can talk to her.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.899
I've tried, Zoe.
She won't listen.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.367
Well, try again.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.032
Look, Carter women
are complicated

30:33.165 --> 30:36.623
and stubborn
and slightly crazy,

30:37.419 --> 30:39.250
but we're definitely
worth the fight.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.086
She doesn't want me
to fight anymore, Zoe.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.126
So, I'm going home.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.671
Can I have my coffee,
please?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.260
Tell her goodbye for me.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.551
Tell her yourself.

Mmm-hmm.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.773
Arming mechanism.
Yeah.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.612
And I've rigged you
a motion detector

31:07.741 --> 31:08.821
so you can track
Spot's movement.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.939
Thank you.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.942
Are you sure
freezing this thing
is gonna work?

31:12.079 --> 31:13.990
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
it worked in The Blob.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.077
Oh, very reassuring.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.492
Well, it's
a living organism.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.082
The cells shouldn't be able
to stand temperatures
below 200 Kelvin.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.246
Just be careful, Carter.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.121
I should be able
to handle a mindless
eating machine.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.168
You looked at me again.

31:28.178 --> 31:32.763
Oh. No. The...
No, no, lwas... The...

31:32.891 --> 31:33.926
You're pretty.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.469
Oh, nice save!

31:36.103 --> 31:37.183
The Blob.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.973
Must have been drawn
by the emissions
from the power station

31:39.106 --> 31:40.095
at Sublevel 12.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.223
But that emits
alpha radiation,
not gamma.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.941
Which means any source
of radiation could be
on the menu now.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.435
Including us.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.315
Awesome.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.615
I'm in.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.740
CARTER: Now what?

32:00.877 --> 32:02.959
All right, Jack,
watch yourself.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.044
Well, he's not
detecting any
movement down there.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.040
ALLISON: But the station's
alpha emissions are
at 20% and dropping.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.212
Jack, Spot's got
to be there.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.927
The relay station's
on your left
about 50 meters down.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.512
Be careful.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.472
Yeah. Thanks.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.310
Hey, Spot?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.723
Got a nice frozen
treat for you.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.903
(BEEPING)

32:35.996 --> 32:37.827
Uh, something's happening.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.531
Movement detected,
40 meters away.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.953
Movement is minimal,
relatively stationary.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.668
ALLISON: Alpha emissions
now at 10%.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.129
All right, maybe it's
still working on dinner.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.342
It's on the move,
heading right towards him.
Thirty meters and closing.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.559
Alpha emissions depleted.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.724
Talk about
a dine and dash.
Twenty meters.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.683
I don't see it.
Where is it?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.809
Ten meters.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.982
Jack, just look around.
I mean, he's got to be
right in front of you!

33:12.115 --> 33:13.901
You should be
able to see it.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.113
Or not.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.033
(GRUNTING)

33:35.305 --> 33:36.966
(SPOT GROANING)

33:38.642 --> 33:40.598
Jack, what's happening?
You okay?

33:40.727 --> 33:41.933
Jack, come on,
say something!

33:42.062 --> 33:44.428
ALLISON: What's going on?
Carter?

33:45.482 --> 33:47.939
Yeah, how do you
like me now, huh?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.188
(CARTER PANTING)

33:59.287 --> 34:02.905
Wait a second.
It's moving away.
Ten meters, 15 meters...

34:03.041 --> 34:04.906
Jack, what's happening?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.209
I think I made it mad.

34:12.968 --> 34:13.923
It's back in the pipes.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.007
Yeah, but I'm guessing
not for long.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.592
So much for your
Hollywood ending.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.881
Tess.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.390
So I was wrong
about the cold thing,

34:19.516 --> 34:21.882
but Spotjumped off Fargo
for a reason.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.134
Well, maybe,
it didn't like
the way he tasted.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.185
Hmm.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.097
That's not bad.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.565
l have my moments.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.358
Okay.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.069
So, what?
Duncan's beauty cream?

34:35.198 --> 34:36.358
I mean, Fargo had it
all over him.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.992
If it neutralized
the gamma radiation
in the guys,

34:38.118 --> 34:39.073
it might neutralize Spot.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.191
So, what's in it?

34:40.328 --> 34:42.990
Well, he uses a variety
of organic astringents,
antioxidants,

34:43.123 --> 34:44.329
anhydrous desiccants.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.288
(STAMMERING)

34:46.418 --> 34:48.158
Desiccants, it's a
hydroscopic substance

34:48.295 --> 34:50.331
that induces dryness
in its environment.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.999
Like salt!
Yeah.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.918
Or salty things!

34:54.050 --> 34:55.085
Yeah.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.833
Your brain is really
an enigma.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.961
No, but could we use
that to fight Spot?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.429
I mean, salt can kill slugs.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.800
By dehydration.
So, if Spot's physiology
is similar,

35:04.936 --> 35:07.894
then Duncan's compound
would have the same effect.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.638
Great. We get like
a truckload of it

35:09.774 --> 35:11.150
and just flush it
down the drain
and kill it.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.983
Well, I don't know.
Freezing it only affected
the outer shell.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.352
Well, then we need
a better delivery system,

35:15.488 --> 35:18.616
something that” blast
the compound inside-out.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.692
I think I got some guys
who can help us.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.781
Bringing me behind
enemy lines, Deputy?

35:23.913 --> 35:24.948
You must really like me.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.948
Or I'm just
trying to kill you.
Which is it?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.164
Hey, you're not
green anymore.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.706
But you're still stupid.
Go figure.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.454
Stop! You guys
made this mess.
You can help us fix it.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.501
What do you want?

35:35.634 --> 35:37.590
Your camoscope,
hand it over.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.506
No can do, Sheriff.
You don't have
clearance at Area 51.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.049
But I do.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.388
Tess Fontana?

35:43.516 --> 35:44.926
What are you doing
slumming with these losers?

35:45.060 --> 35:47.096
Slumming?
Who do you think
you're fooling, Toby?

35:47.228 --> 35:50.095
You applied to
transfer here three times.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.266
Oh, busted!

35:51.399 --> 35:53.105
Yeah, guys, we don't
have time for this.
Hand it over.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.223
TESS: Come on.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.601
(SIGHS)

35:57.197 --> 35:58.186
Here you go.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.278
You got
Duncan's formula?
Yeah.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.193
Time to put everybody's
toys together. Let's go.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.281
(CLICKS TONGUE)

36:02.410 --> 36:03.946
You first.
Oh, no, after you.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.327
Thanks.
Yeah, I love messing
with those guys.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.999
(RUMBLING)
Oh!

36:16.841 --> 36:18.377
What's going on?

36:19.678 --> 36:22.385
That was Spot breaking
through the shutoff valves
on the main pipeline.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.503
It's gotten out
of the building.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.221
All right, we're gonna
have to figure out
where it's going.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.092
Well, there are radiation
sources all over town,
including the people.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.219
Yeah, but Globidium's
still its favorite
flavor, right?

36:30.355 --> 36:32.391
Yeah, but everybody's
turned it in.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.139
Well, not everybody.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.685
Who's left?

36:36.528 --> 36:37.563
Me.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.944
Zoe, it's me.
Are you at the house?

36:40.073 --> 36:42.064
Mmm. I'm at Cafe Diem.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.566
Good. Is Lexi with you?
SARAH's not picking up.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.944
No, she got takeout
and went home.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.661
Something wrong?

36:48.790 --> 36:52.123
Yeah. I don't think
she'll be dining alone.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.084
(DOORBELL RINGING)

36:55.213 --> 36:57.124
SARAH, can you
get the door?

36:58.258 --> 36:59.464
SARAH?

37:00.468 --> 37:01.719
SARAH?

37:24.284 --> 37:26.946
LEXI: SARAH?
SARAH, what's going on?

37:29.122 --> 37:31.955
Lexi? You make me crazy.
You know that?

37:32.083 --> 37:33.243
Uh, come on in.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.786
You don't get to just
decide everything.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.534
You're not the
supreme decider.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.332
(SCOFFS) Supreme decider?

37:39.132 --> 37:41.464
You may have
nothing else to say,
all right? But I do.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.424
And I'm not leaving
until you hear it.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.793
Okay.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.044
I know we didn't
plan for this.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.967
I know that kids are
gonna change things.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.885
Maybe we won't
travel the world
for a while,

37:50.018 --> 37:53.476
but when we do, at least
we'll see things through
the eyes of our kids.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.062
Honestly, I can't think
of anything better.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.601
Okay, you say that now,

37:57.734 --> 38:00.350
but what about
in six months,
or six years?

38:00.487 --> 38:03.069
This isn't
a temporary assignment
in Tanzania, Duncan.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.938
This is the rest
of our lives.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.689
That doesn't scare me.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.820
I know I freaked out
before, okay,

38:08.953 --> 38:10.818
but you don't have
to doubt me now.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.165
Okay, it's not
that I doubted you.
It's just...

38:15.919 --> 38:17.910
When I was a kid,
I always had the feeling

38:18.046 --> 38:19.502
that my dad
would rather be
somewhere else,

38:19.631 --> 38:22.338
and I would just hate it
if you ever felt that way.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.207
Lexi, I love you.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.053
I want us all
to be together.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.921
I know the timing
isn't perfect and we're
gonna have our problems,

38:29.057 --> 38:31.844
but whatever comes,
we'll handle it.

to reconsider.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.962
No. This is basically
a salt center with a
gamma-radiation shell.

When it loosens, you run.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.583
Yeah.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.095
Does Spot want a treat?

39:13.977 --> 39:16.184
There you go.
There you go.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.141
Here you go. Okay.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.691
Okay. Is it loosening?

as a yes?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.476
Yes. Yes!

40:02.609 --> 40:03.644

live here, do we?

And with Area 51
in the lead,

Eureka needs the spare
in order to win.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.253
The pressure is on.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.716
Come on!
We can do this!

40:33.014 --> 40:34.470
I thought you guys
would already be
on the road.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.055
Oh, don't sound so anxious.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.549
I'm not anxious.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.016
I'm totally gonna
miss you, Aunt Lex.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.056
Oh, I'm totally
gonna miss you, too.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.601
And I'm actually gonna
miss you, as well.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.349
And I'm actually
almost touched.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.776
Don't worry.
We'll come back
and visit.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.065
Oh, you better.

41:59.392 --> 42:01.098
Big of you to say, Bismark.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.342
Doesn't make us
friends, though.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.139
I'll shake on that.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.643
That's an amazing
shot, Fargo.

42:11.779 --> 42:12.814
Thank you, Sheriff.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.687
And thank you
for not playing
any more pranks.

42:14.824 --> 42:15.984
I appreciate that.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.402
Yeah, well, we won.

to rub it in their faces.

42:24.167 --> 42:27.204
But we really wanted to.

No. We can't get
an image.

we'll have no way of
knowing what's coming

on top of us.

how to decipher
the signal, no.

Listen, Tess,

42:53.988 --> 42:55.228
General Mansfield
is concerned

42:55.364 --> 42:57.980
that whatever is
