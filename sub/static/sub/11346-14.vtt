IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.503 --> 00:03.704
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES

00:03.737 --> 00:06.107
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.476
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.509 --> 00:10.311
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.344 --> 00:11.712
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.745 --> 00:14.048
KNOWN AS THE
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.217
THESE ARE
THEIR STORIES.

00:21.189 --> 00:24.158

[groaning]

00:24.192 --> 00:27.061
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE'S BEEN MONEY ALL NIGHT.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.797
GAME IS OVER. I HAVE TO STUDY.
- SIT DOWN.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.265
I BET YOU
THEY COME BACK.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.401
- DAD,
I DON'T WANNA BET.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.804
- I SAID SIT DOWN.
YOU'RE MY LUCKY CHARM.

00:36.837 --> 00:37.805
[doorbell ringing]

00:37.838 --> 00:40.508
JOAN, WILL YOU GET THAT?
THAT'S THE CHINESE.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.178
THERE'S, LIKE...
- TWO MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME.

00:44.212 --> 00:47.181
I KNOW.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.623
- ALL RIGHT,
CHINESE OR ITALIAN?

00:55.656 --> 00:56.624
I'LL LET YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.227
- HEY, GUYS, HOLD OFF
ON YOUR DINNER BREAK.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.095
WE GOT A SHOOTING
IN YORKVILLE.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.396
TWO FATALITIES CONFIRMED.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.698

SVU BECAUSE...

01:04.732 --> 01:07.301
- WELL, THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE

01:07.335 --> 01:10.171
CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE NEW YORK

01:10.204 --> 01:12.406
I'LL HAVE LIV AND FIN
MEET YOU THERE.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.415
- MESSY CRIME SCENE.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

01:21.449 --> 01:22.716
- DELIVERY GUY
FOUND THEM.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.685
NO FORCED ENTRY,
NO SIGN OF ROBBERY.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.454
YOU WALKED IN
PAST THE WIFE, JOAN.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.688
SHE OPENED THE DOOR
ON THE SHOOTER.

01:27.721 --> 01:31.292
NOW HE DOES HER,
THEN BEFORE THEY CAN REACT,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.227
HE MOVES TO THE HUSBAND
AND DAUGHTER ON THE COUCH.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.429
THIS IS THE HUSBAND,
SIDNEY ECKHOUSE.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.597
- WHAT ABOUT
THE DAUGHTER?

01:36.630 --> 01:38.332
- EMMY. 14.

01:38.366 --> 01:41.635
IN SURGERY AT ST. MICHAEL'S.
BULLET IN HER HEAD.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.537
- FOUND THIS
IN THE WALL.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.905
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE OTHERS.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.141
EMS MADE A MESS
OF THE SCENE.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.611
GOOD LUCK TRYING
TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT WENT DOWN.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.913
- FULL METAL JACKET?

01:52.946 --> 01:57.418
IT'S A WINCHESTER 357 SIG.
IT'S ONE WAY TO SEND A MESSAGE.

01:57.451 --> 02:02.856
- I'VE SEEN MY SHARE
OF HATE CRIMES, BUT, UH...

02:02.890 --> 02:04.425
EXECUTION OF
A WHOLE FAMILY?

02:04.458 --> 02:09.163
THAT'S, UH...EXTREME.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.398
- DETECTIVES.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.700
I HEARD THE SIRENS,
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.202
NO ONE WILL TELL ME ANYTHING.
- AND WHO ARE YOU, SON?

02:14.235 --> 02:16.637
I'M ROB, EMMY'S BOYFRIEND.
- I'M ROB'S FATHER.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.838
- MR...
- FISHER.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.307
- WHAT HAPPENED?
IS EMMY ALL RIGHT?

02:19.340 --> 02:22.243
WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE'S AT THE HOSPITAL.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.845
- OH, MY GOD.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.181
YOU HAPPY NOW, DAD?
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.758
[intense music]

02:37.791 --> 02:45.799
*

03:22.035 --> 03:23.337
- EMMY WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME OVER TONIGHT TO STUDY,

03:23.371 --> 03:27.841
BUT MY DAD
MADE ME CANCEL.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.243
IF HE HADN'T
GROUNDED ME,

03:29.277 --> 03:30.411
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SHOT.
I KNOW IT.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.813
- DID SHE COME OVER
A LOT OF NIGHTS?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.415
TO...STUDY?
- ALL THE TIME.

03:34.448 --> 03:38.419
MY DAD THOUGHT EMMY
WAS DISTRACTING ME.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.721
THAT'S MY DAD, ALWAYS TRYING
TO TEACH ME A LESSON.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.756
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN TOGETHER?

03:42.790 --> 03:43.957
- EIGHT MONTHS.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.993
WE CONNECTED
RIGHT AWAY.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.495
- BUT YOUR DAD DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA

03:47.528 --> 03:48.796
FOR YOU TWO TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP?

03:48.829 --> 03:53.334
- I TOLD HIM WE WEREN'T
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.337
EVEN GOT EMMY TO TAKE
THE ABSTINENCE PLEDGE.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.340
HE JUST COULDN'T
LET IT GO.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.008
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW
THE ECKHOUSES?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.943
- I KNEW
SIDNEY BETTER.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.445
I MEAN, JOAN WAS
ALWAYS WORKING.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.480
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS
A REAL CRUSADER,

04:06.514 --> 04:07.915
YOU KNOW,
WITH HER GAY THING.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.484
- WHAT ABOUT THEIR MARRIAGE?
- WHO KNOWS?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.386
I SAW HIM WITH
HIS DAUGHTER MOSTLY.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.788
- HOW DID HE FEEL ABOUT
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SON?

04:14.822 --> 04:17.391
- WE WERE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.360
LOOK, THEY'RE KIDS.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.661
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
TOO INTENSE.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.298
WE'D EMAIL ABOUT CURFEWS,
GROUND RULES.

04:24.332 --> 04:27.335
- WELL, HE SEEMED PRETTY UPSET
BY THOSE RULES.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.537
- THAT'S PART
OF BEING A DAD.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.339
I MEAN, I EVEN HAD
TO LOCK HIM IN TONIGHT

04:31.372 --> 04:32.840
WHEN I WENT
TO WALK THE DOG.

04:32.873 --> 04:33.807
- HOW ABOUT
OTHER NIGHTS?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.909
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE
WATCHING THE HOUSE,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.110
OR A CAR
PARKED OUTSIDE?

04:37.144 --> 04:40.314
- I MEAN, THERE WAS A SQUAD CAR
PARKED OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE

04:40.348 --> 04:42.983
ABOUT A MONTH AGO
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.084
- SIDNEY SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.085
- AW, I DIDN'T ASK.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.356
I MEAN, WHATEVER IT WAS,
IT WASN'T MY BUSINESS.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.428
- JOAN AND I WORKED
ON THE GAY MARRIAGE BILL.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.497
THERE WERE THREATS...

04:56.530 --> 04:57.965
HATE MAIL.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.401
- YOU KEEP RECORD
OF THE THREATS?

05:00.434 --> 05:04.538
- OF COURSE.
I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.773
YOU HAVE TO FIND
THE SONS OF BITCHES

05:05.806 --> 05:07.475
THAT DID THIS TO HER.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.610
YOU KNOW...

05:09.643 --> 05:12.713
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,
SHE WAS REALLY SPOOKED.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.815
- SHE MENTION
ANYTHING SPECIFIC?

05:14.848 --> 05:18.486
- SHE WAS GETTING CALLS
LATE AT NIGHT. HANG-UPS.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
AND A FEW TIMES,
SHE THOUGHT

05:20.854 --> 05:22.423
THERE WAS A CAR
FOLLOWING HER AND EMMY.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.593
- IS THAT WHY THE POLICE
WERE THERE A MONTH AGO?

05:25.626 --> 05:29.830
- JOAN DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT THAT.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.366
SHE WOULD'VE TOLD ME.
- YOU KNOW...

05:32.400 --> 05:35.803
LOOKING AT THESE PHOTOS
AND THE PRESS,

05:35.836 --> 05:36.804
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
THE PUBLIC FACE

05:36.837 --> 05:37.871
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.474
- YEAH, I MEAN, JOAN WAS MORE
BEHIND THE SCENES,

05:40.508 --> 05:41.409
BUT WE WERE A TEAM.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.612
- SO WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY TARGETED HER

05:44.645 --> 05:46.580
INSTEAD OF YOU?

05:46.614 --> 05:51.652
- IT MAY HAVE BEEN
TO GET TO ME.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.722
OH, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS ANYWAY,

05:54.755 --> 05:58.592
BUT JOAN AND I
WERE INVOLVED.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.961
- OKAY.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.664
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN JEALOUS

06:03.697 --> 06:05.599
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

06:05.633 --> 06:08.736
- NO.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.472
SHE WAS MY LIFE.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.842
WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR EMMY
TO GET A LITTLE OLDER.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.946
JOAN WAS GONNA LEAVE SIDNEY
AND WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.052
- TERRIBLE WAY
TO START OFF THE YEAR.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.454
THERE GO MY STATS.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.055
- LET'S JUST
GET THIS DONE.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.524
- I KNOW SVU'S GOT THE LEAD
ON THIS CASE,

06:30.558 --> 06:31.725
BUT WE'LL
HOLD UP OUR END.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.661
- SO WE'D LIKE TO TALK
TO MARTINEZ AND PARKER.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.162
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH THEM?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.163
- THEY RESPONDED
TO A CALL

06:36.196 --> 06:38.466
AT THE ECKHOUSE RESIDENCE
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.601
- LIKE I SAID,
I WANNA HELP,

06:40.634 --> 06:43.070
BUT THOSE TWO GUYS,
THEY'RE NOT ON THE JOB ANYMORE.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.505
- BOTH OF THEM?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.806
- THEY WERE MOONLIGHTING
FOR A BOOKIE.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.875
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.710
THEIR STUFF'S OVER THERE.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.911
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
COME BACK FOR IT.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.081
HELP YOURSELF.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.549
- ANY UPDATE ON
THE GIRL'S CONDITION?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.950
- WELL, THE BULLET
HAS BEEN REMOVED.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.952
SHE'S OUT OF SURGERY,
IN A DRUG-INDUCED COMA,

06:58.986 --> 07:01.522
BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
HOW SHE REALLY IS

07:01.555 --> 07:02.523
UNTIL THE SWELLING
GOES DOWN.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.592
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE BOYFRIEND AND HIS DAD?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.193
HOW BAD WAS THE BLOOD
BETWEEN THESE TWO FAMILIES?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.529
- THESE TWO KIDS WERE
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.897
THE FATHERS THOUGHT
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.798
THE EMAILS CONFIRM.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.500
- OKAY, AND THE COALITION
THREAT LIST?

07:12.533 --> 07:15.469
- UH, ANONYMOUS HATE MAIL,
PHONE CALLS, I MEAN...

07:15.503 --> 07:18.138
- THAT'S A BIG LEAP BETWEEN THAT
AND EXECUTING A FAMILY.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.707
- WELL, JOAN TOLD
HER PARTNER

07:19.740 --> 07:21.575
SHE THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS STALKING HER.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.477
- OKAY, ANY CHANCE
IT COULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
JEALOUS ABOUT
THE AFFAIR?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.780
- NO, THEY WERE
PRETTY DISCREET.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.215
- SO CHECK THIS OUT.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.850
THESE ARE NOTES
FROM THE OFFICER

07:29.883 --> 07:31.652
RESPONDING TO
THE ECKHOUSE RESIDENCE.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.821
SO IT WAS A DOMESTIC
EMPLOYEE INCIDENT,

07:33.854 --> 07:36.524
AND THEIR HOUSEKEEPER,
CARMEN VASQUEZ,

07:36.557 --> 07:38.859
SHE CLAIMED THAT SIDNEY
HAD ASSAULTED HER.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.895
AND HE TOLD THE OFFICER THAT
SHE HAD BEEN STEALING JEWELRY.

07:41.929 --> 07:45.265
- SO THE HOUSEKEEPER
GETS IN A FIGHT WITH SIDNEY,

07:45.298 --> 07:49.102
WAITS A MONTH, COMES BACK,
AND CAPS EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.971
JUST NOT SURE
THAT TRACKS FOR ME.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.506
- WELL, THIS MIGHT HELP.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.207
CARMEN HAS A BROTHER
NAMED JIMMY.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.243
GOT OUT OF GREENHAVEN
SIX MONTHS AGO.

07:56.276 --> 07:59.046
DID FOUR YEARS FOR ARMED
ROBBERY AND ASSAULT.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.950
HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS
IS 111TH STREET.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.986
- ALL RIGHT, FIN, ROLLINS,
GO BACK TO THE ECKHOUSES'.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.021
DO AN INVENTORY
OF THEIR VALUABLES,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.791
THINGS THE MAID COULD'VE TIPPED
HER BROTHER OFF ABOUT.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.495
YOU TWO, SEE WHAT
THE VASQUEZ FAMILY HAS TO SAY.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.034
- HOW IS EMMY?
WE'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR HER.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.570
SHE'S LIKE
A DAUGHTER TO ME.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.237
- HOW LONG DID YOU WORK
FOR THE ECKHOUSES?

08:24.271 --> 08:27.608
- I TOOK CARE OF THAT GIRL
SINCE SHE WAS TWO MONTHS OLD.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.976
WE GOTTA
PULL HER THROUGH.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.078
- AND WHEN DID YOU STOP
WORKING FOR THEM?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.647
- ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.650
SHE HAD
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES,

08:36.684 --> 08:39.119
I NEEDED MORE HOURS.
- YOUR LEAVING...

08:39.152 --> 08:41.054
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE POLICE COMING

08:41.088 --> 08:42.990
TO THE ECKHOUSES' HOME?
[speaks Spanish]

08:43.023 --> 08:45.859
- I NEVER STOLE
ANY JEWELRY.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.994
I WOULD NEVER.

08:47.027 --> 08:47.795
- OKAY...

08:47.828 --> 08:49.830
WELL, NOBODY SAID
THAT YOU DID.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.566
- SIDNEY DID.
BUT HE WAS LYING.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.234
JOAN HAD A BENEFIT.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.903
SHE COULDN'T FIND
HER DIAMOND EARRINGS.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.238
14 YEARS,
I WORK FOR THEM.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.207
HE GETS IN TROUBLE,
AND HE BLAMES ME.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.643
AND THAT COP
TOOK HIS SIDE.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.645
TOLD ME TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.
- SLOW DOWN, CARMEN.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.814
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?

09:06.847 --> 09:12.152
- HE PAWNED
THOSE EARRINGS HIMSELF.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.187
HE WAS A GAMBLER,
HE OWED BIG.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.824
HE HAD ALREADY SOLD OFF
HIS AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS,

09:16.857 --> 09:19.226
HIS WATCH--
- AND JOAN DIDN'T KNOW?

09:19.259 --> 09:22.062
- THEY LIVED TOGETHER,
BUT THEY LIVED APART.

09:22.095 --> 09:27.367
- WELL, I'M SORRY, CARMEN,
BUT WE HAVE TO ASK YOU...

09:27.400 --> 09:28.836
WHERE WERE YOU
ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

09:28.869 --> 09:30.971
- BIBLE STUDY.
- Y TU HERMANO?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.340
JIMMY? WHERE WAS HE?

09:33.373 --> 09:36.209
- HE WAS LEADING
THE SESSION.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.044
I KNOW HE'S AN EX-CON,

09:37.077 --> 09:39.713
BUT HE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.381
JIMMY TURNED HIMSELF
AROUND INSIDE.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.884
FOUND GOD.

09:43.917 --> 09:49.222
- FOR IN MY DARKEST HOUR,
JESUS CAME TO ME.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.092
AND HE SAID,
"MY SON,

09:52.125 --> 09:56.664
I CAN HEAL YOU IF YOU
LET ME LIVE IN YOUR HEART."

09:56.697 --> 10:00.333
IT'S THAT SIMPLE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

10:00.367 --> 10:05.773
AND I FELT A POWER
I'D NEVER FELT BEFORE.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.241
WHY?

10:08.275 --> 10:12.279
BECAUSE I WAS
NO LONGER ALONE.

10:12.312 --> 10:16.917
EMMY'S NOT ALONE EITHER.
JESUS IS WITH HER.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.286
AND IF WE PRAY HARD ENOUGH
AND SINCERELY ENOUGH,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.254
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF OUR HEARTS,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.691
HIS GRACE, HIS GLORY
WILL HEAL HER TOO.

10:23.724 --> 10:29.062
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE.

10:36.904 --> 10:40.407
[clapping,
music playing]

10:40.440 --> 10:42.676
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE HERE,
YOU KNOW, AND UH--

10:42.710 --> 10:44.845
AND I'M GLAD SOMEBODY'S
FIGHTING FOR EMMY.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.414
OKAY, THAT GIRL'S AN ANGEL.
SO ASK ANYTHING.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.183
- HOW ABOUT AN EASY ONE?
WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY NIGHT?

10:50.217 --> 10:53.353
- I WAS RIGHT HERE.
FRIDAY NIGHT BIBLE STUDY.

10:53.386 --> 10:57.224
ISAIAH 42:7:
"TO OPEN BLIND EYES."

10:57.257 --> 10:59.827
"TO RELEASE THE PRISONERS
FROM THE PRISON."

10:59.860 --> 11:02.262
- CAN ANYONE BESIDES YOUR SISTER
CONFIRM YOU WERE HERE?

11:02.295 --> 11:05.933
- ABOUT SIX MEMBERS
OF MY CONGREGATION.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.735
AND, YES, SOME OF THEM
HAVE RECORDS TOO,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.803
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY
ON THE RIGHTEOUS PATH.

11:09.837 --> 11:10.804
- GLAD TO HEAR THAT,

11:10.838 --> 11:12.105
BUT WE'LL NEED NAMES.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.241
- OF COURSE, ANYTHING.
I MEAN, THAT GIRL?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.809
THAT'S MY ANGEL
RIGHT THERE.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.811
- HEY, WHEN DID YOU MEET HER?
- MEET HER?

11:17.845 --> 11:18.979
I'VE KNOWN HER
SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE KID.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.347
I MEAN, I TAUGHT HER HOW
TO RIDE A BIKE.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.882
- SO YOU WERE CLOSE
WITH THE FAMILY

11:21.915 --> 11:22.916
BEFORE YOUR ARREST?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.485
- AND AFTER.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.388
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DESERT YOU
WHEN YOU GO UPSTATE.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.456
BUT EMMY WROTE ME.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.192
SHE EVEN CAME UP WITH CARMEN
ON THE BUS TO VISIT.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.794
- SHE EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT HER HOME LIFE?

11:33.827 --> 11:37.130
- OH, YOU MEAN
HER FATHER?

11:38.832 --> 11:42.870
THAT MAN WASN'T RIGHT.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.006
HE'D EVEN HAVE THAT GIRL
PLACE BOOK FOR HIM.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.341
SHE TOLD ME,
WHEN HE'D GET TOO DRUNK,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.444
HE'D SEND HER DOWN THE STREET
TO THE BAR TO PLACE HIS BETS.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.286
- WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE NYPD?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.354
DID ALL THE
WHITE GUYS RETIRE?

12:01.388 --> 12:06.026
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I'M ALL FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.261
- WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT ONE
OF YOUR FORMER CLIENTS,

12:08.295 --> 12:09.329
SIDNEY ECKHOUSE.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.300
- HERE'S WHAT
I GOT FOR YOU...

12:13.333 --> 12:14.401
[blows raspberry]

12:14.434 --> 12:17.771
- YOU SERIOUS?
I GOT A FOUR-YEAR-OLD

12:17.805 --> 12:18.806
KNOWS BETTER
THAN THAT.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.074
- YOU HAVE ANY MORE
QUESTIONS HERE, GENTLEMEN?

12:21.108 --> 12:24.912
- EMMY ECKHOUSE, BEEN SEEN
REPEATEDLY IN THIS BAR.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.379
WE FIGURE SHE
WAS EITHER PLACING BETS

12:26.413 --> 12:28.048
OR DRINKING UNDERAGE.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.251
NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHICH ONE
YOU ARE GOING DOWN FOR.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.419
WE'LL LET YOU
PICK IT ON THE WAY.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.022
COME ON.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.857
- SEEMS LIKE SERVING MINORS
IN YOUR BAR

12:36.890 --> 12:38.892
IS JUST THE TIP
OF THE ICEBERG.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.362
FELONIOUS ASSAULT, 6/09.
BROKE A MAN'S LEGS AND ARMS

12:42.395 --> 12:44.932
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.
CRACKED HIS SKULL.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.201
APRIL '05, YOU PLACED
A MAN'S OPEN MOUTH

12:48.235 --> 12:50.437
ON THE EDGE OF A CURB
OUTSIDE THE BLARNEY STONE PUB,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.873
THEN STOMPED ON THE BACK
OF HIS HEAD.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.408
THEY NEEDED WIRES AND STEEL RODS
TO PUT HIS FACE BACK TOGETHER.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.479
THAT WAS ATTEMPTED MURDER.
- GOES ON FOR TWO PAGES.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.215
IT'S DANGEROUS
OWING YOU MONEY, HUH?

13:02.249 --> 13:06.253
- THESE ARE VERY
GOOD STORIES.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.354
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS GOOD?

13:07.387 --> 13:10.924
- MM?
- TWILIGHT.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.060
THEY SAY IT'S
JUST FOR TWEENS,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.395
BUT I DO LOVE
THOSE VAMPIRES.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.066
- ANYONE CAN MAKE CHARGES.
MR. MURPHY HAS NO CONVICTIONS.

13:19.099 --> 13:23.270
- TWO PARENTS ARE DEAD,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.906
AND A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.241
SO NOBODY'S GONNA WRIGGLE
OUT OF THIS ONE.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.543
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.512
- IF MY CLIENT
DID HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

13:32.545 --> 13:35.082
WITH THE PRIOR ASSAULTS
YOU MENTIONED,

13:35.115 --> 13:37.951
IT'S WORTH NOTING
THERE WAS NO GUN INVOLVED,

13:37.985 --> 13:40.453
AND EVERY
VICTIM SURVIVED.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.857
THIS WOULD SERVE
AN ALLEGED BOOKIE

13:43.891 --> 13:47.227
NO PURPOSE, AS DEAD MEN
PAY NO DEBTS.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.931
- SIX FOR SIX.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.434
HIS ENTIRE BIBLE STUDY CLASS
SWEARS JIMMY VASQUEZ

13:54.467 --> 13:56.436
WAS HOLDING THEIR HAND
ALL FRIDAY NIGHT.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.005
- WHAT ABOUT
THE MISSING JEWELRY?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.572
- WE TRACED IT ALL
TO A PAWN SHOP

13:59.606 --> 14:01.408
IN THE LOWER
EAST SIDE.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.143
TICKETS WERE
IN SIDNEY'S NAME.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.280
- WELL, LET'S HOPE BENSON
AND AMARO ARE ONTO SOMETHING.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.249
- WHAT ABOUT
THE BOYFRIEND'S DAD?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.118
- NO, I WENT
TO THE DOG PARK.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.086
HE WAS THERE
ON FRIDAY, SO I--

14:16.689 --> 14:19.292
- THAT SMILE,
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.363
- YOU JEALOUS?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.914
OH!

14:40.948 --> 14:43.917
OH! OH!

14:43.951 --> 14:45.418
[gasping]

14:45.452 --> 14:50.123
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS,
THIS IS OFFICER PARKER.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.125
THOUGHT YOU TWO MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.326
- [moaning]

14:53.360 --> 14:56.329
- GET UP.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.364
- [whimpering]

14:59.332 --> 15:01.668
OH, GOD! OH...

15:04.004 --> 15:08.308
- YOU'RE IN DEEP
TO THE WRONG GUYS, SWEETHEART.

15:08.341 --> 15:12.946
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DUMB ENOUGH
TO TALK TO YOUR CAPTAIN.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.415
- IF YOU DO...

15:15.448 --> 15:18.251
YOU WON'T
SEE US COMING.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.353
YOU'LL JUST BE GONE.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.323
UNDERSTAND?

15:23.356 --> 15:26.126
GOOD GIRL.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.404
- [breathing hard]

15:48.548 --> 15:49.549
- HEY.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.552
THANKS FOR COMING
TO MEET ME.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.187
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
WHAT'S UP?

15:59.559 --> 16:00.593
- FIN,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.764
- THAT GUY MURPHY,
RIGHT?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.199
- YEAH.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.536
BACK HOME, I WAS
IN FOOTBALL POOLS,

16:09.569 --> 16:15.475
I BET NCAA TOURNAMENTS,
THE DERBY, BIG STUFF.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.410
I LIKED THE ACTION,
BUT IT WASN'T SERIOUS.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.046
BUT SINCE I GOT
TO NEW YORK...

16:19.079 --> 16:24.284
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.552
- HOW DEEP YOU IN?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.554
- 20 K.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.289
- PLUS THE JUICE
EVERY WEEK?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.657
- YEAH, I WAS DOWN 50
AT ONE POINT.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.460
- DID HE ALWAYS
KNOW YOU WERE A COP?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.461
- NO.

16:34.494 --> 16:39.066
I TOLD HIM
I WAS A BARTENDER.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.234
I CHECKED HIM OUT, I WANTED
TO KNOW WHO I WAS DEALING WITH.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.636
I MADE MY PAY-OFF
AT HIS BAR.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.672
I WAITED, AND I FOLLOWED
MURPHY WHEN HE LEFT.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.806
- WHERE'D HE GO?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.476
- TO A SOCIAL CLUB
IN HELL'S KITCHEN.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.743
- A BOOKIE JOINT.

16:50.777 --> 16:56.816
- AND I DID SOME DIGGING AROUND
ON MURPHY'S KNOWN ASSOCIATES.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.352
HIS BOSS'S NAME
IS MCCOURT.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.455
SCARY GUY.

17:02.489 --> 17:07.794
TONIGHT, MURPHY...

17:07.827 --> 17:09.762
KNOCKED ME AROUND,
HE THREATENED ME.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.832
HE HAD THAT GUY PARKER
WITH HIM FOR BACKUP.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.634
- HE HIT YOU?
- YEAH.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.271
- ARE YOU OKAY?

17:18.305 --> 17:21.774
YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.747
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA KNOW
ABOUT YOUR NEW PARTNER?

17:30.350 --> 17:36.089
- OKAY, THIS IS THE DEAL.
- [sighing]

17:36.123 --> 17:37.590
- WE TAKE THESE CREEPS
OFF THE STREET,

17:37.624 --> 17:42.495
AND LET THEM KNOW EXACTLY
WHO THE HELL WE ARE.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.265
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME CLEAN TO THE CAPTAIN.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.241
- NYPD, HANDS UP.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.342
GRAB SOME WALL.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.544
GRAB SOME WALL.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.547
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP,
LET ME SEE THEM.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.617
ANYONE SCRATCHES HIS NOSE,
I SHOOT.

18:04.651 --> 18:08.555
HEY, PARKER.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.557
- NICK.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.526
OLD TIME'S SAKE?
THE ACADEMY?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.195
- I REMEMBER
TAKING THE OATH.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.863
DO YOU?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.268
- HEY, MURPHY...

18:23.270 --> 18:25.905
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S FOR, RIGHT?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.641
- SURE.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.178
BUT YOU TELL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
SHE'S GOING TO BE SORRY.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.579
- THREATENING A DETECTIVE,
HUH?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.580
WHY DON'T WE JUST ADD THAT

18:33.613 --> 18:35.515
TO THE REST
OF YOUR CHARGES.

18:35.548 --> 18:39.452
- DETECTIVE?
SHE'S A DEGENERATE.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.488
YOU THINK BUSTING ME
IS GOING TO STOP HER?

18:41.521 --> 18:44.257
YOU'RE WRONG.
YOUR GIRL'S SICK.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.659
- NEED TO LEARN
SOME RESPECT.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.428
- HEY, FIN.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.265
MCCOURT?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.533
- BEFORE YOU COMPOUND
YOUR MISTAKE,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.568
OPEN THE SIDE DRAWER
TO MY DESK.

18:55.602 --> 19:00.407
GO AHEAD, OPEN IT.
I WANNA END THIS.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.309
- TRYING TO BRIBE US?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.477
- I GOT ENOUGH DEADBEAT COPS
ON MY PAYROLL.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.179
YOU SEE THAT STACK
OF ENVELOPES?

19:06.213 --> 19:08.615
FIND THE ONE MARKED "CROSBY,"
THAT WAS SIDNEY'S CODE NAME.

19:08.648 --> 19:14.587
LIKE SIDNEY CROSBY,
PITTSBURG PENGUINS.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.323
GET IT?
- YEAH.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.957
- OPEN IT.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.460
THAT'S SIDNEY'S.
NIGHT HE DIED,

19:20.493 --> 19:23.563
HIS TEAM MADE A MIRACLE
COMEBACK IN OVERTIME.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.198
- AND YOU'RE MAD
'CAUSE HE WON.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.533
- NOT REALLY.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.302
IF HE WON, HE WAS JUST
GONNA LOSE IT BACK TO ME AGAIN.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.572
SIDNEY WAS A GIFT
THAT JUST KEPT ON GIVING.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.342
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO KILL HIM?

19:40.480 --> 19:44.751
- SO THESE GUYS
DIDN'T KILL THEM.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.286
WE'RE BACK TO ZERO.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.456
- WELL, IT STILL DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.368
- FIN...

20:02.869 --> 20:07.240
THANKS.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.741
- I'M ON MY WAY.

20:08.775 --> 20:13.313
THAT WAS THE HOSPITAL.
EMMY'S OUT OF THE COMA.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.547
- GIRL PULLED THROUGH
ALL RIGHT?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.383
- SHE'S AWAKE,
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.686
I'M MEETING BENSON
AND AMARO THERE NOW.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.327
- THE BULLET WENT
THROUGH EMMY'S SKULL,

20:27.360 --> 20:28.828
PENETRATED THE RIGHT
FRONTAL LOBE,

20:28.861 --> 20:31.030
BUT MISSED HER INTERIOR
CEREBRAL ARTERY

20:31.063 --> 20:33.300
BY A FEW MILLIMETERS.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.402
ALL BRAIN FUNCTION
SEEMS INTACT,

20:35.435 --> 20:37.304
HER VITALS SIGNS
ARE COMING BACK TO NORMAL.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.005
SHE'S A VERY
LUCKY GIRL.

20:39.038 --> 20:39.839
- HOW'S HER MEMORY?

20:39.872 --> 20:42.742
- SHE CAN SPEAK,
KNOWS WHO SHE IS,

20:42.775 --> 20:44.277
SEEMS AWARE
OF HER SURROUNDINGS.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.579
BEYOND THAT,
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.980
- HAS ANYONE ELSE
BEEN IN TO SEE HER?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.416
- BESIDES THE STAFF, NO.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.917
- WHAT ABOUT
HER BOYFRIEND?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.585
- HE'S BARELY LEFT
THE WAITING ROOM

20:52.619 --> 20:56.923
THE PAST FEW DAYS,
BUT WE HAVEN'T LET HIM IN YET.

20:56.956 --> 21:02.362
READY, DETECTIVES?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.964
- HI, EMMY.
I'M DETECTIVE BENSON,

21:04.997 --> 21:08.067
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE AMARO.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.736
- HI.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.972
- I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.408
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.776
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

21:16.809 --> 21:19.679
- WEIRD.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.813
LIKE--LIKE I WAS
IN A BAD DREAM.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.749
- MM-HMM.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.752
- WHERE'S MY
MOM AND DAD?

21:25.785 --> 21:30.857
- YOU KNOW, FIRST,
I, UH...WANTED TO ASK YOU

21:30.890 --> 21:36.929
IF YOU CAN TELL US WHAT THE LAST
THING IS THAT YOU REMEMBER.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.831
- I-I REMEMBER
FEELING ANGRY.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.101
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO ROB'S HOUSE, BUT...

21:42.134 --> 21:45.037
I COULDN'T.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.639
HIS FATHER SAID NO.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.409
- WHAT ELSE
DO YOU REMEMBER?

21:49.442 --> 21:54.847
- MY DAD AND I WERE WATCHING
BASKETBALL ON TV.

21:54.881 --> 21:59.352
- WHAT ELSE, EMMY?

22:02.722 --> 22:07.594
- I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.696
WHERE ARE MY PARENTS?

22:13.433 --> 22:17.770
ARE THEY DEAD?

22:17.804 --> 22:23.009
- YES.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.110
THEY ARE, EMMY.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.415
I'M SO SORRY.

22:28.448 --> 22:32.118
- OH, MY GOD.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.754
WHO DID THIS?

22:34.787 --> 22:35.888
WHY?

22:35.922 --> 22:38.558
- WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.761
- WHERE'S ROB?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.563
DOES HE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
HE'D BE HERE.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.498
- HE IS HERE.
- I WANNA SEE HIM, PLEASE.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.466
- I'LL GET ROB.
- PLEASE.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.736
I WANT ROB. ROB!

22:49.769 --> 22:53.740
ROB, ROB...

22:53.773 --> 22:55.074
- THIS KID'S
BEEN THOUGH HELL,

22:55.107 --> 22:57.610
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
GET ANY EASIER.

22:57.644 --> 23:00.647
- HEY, DOC,
YOU HAVE A SECOND?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.749
I SAW YOU HAVE HER
ON ANTIVIRALS?

23:02.782 --> 23:04.551
CAN I ASK WHY?

23:04.584 --> 23:07.019
LOOK, THIS MAY BE PERTINENT
TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.189
- THE SURGERY TRIGGERED
A HERPES OUTBREAK.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.158
A NURSE NOTICED IT WHEN THEY
WERE CHANGING HER CATHETER.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.426
- GENITAL HERPES?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.527
- SIMPLEX TWO.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.764
NOT THAT UNUSUAL IN A
SEXUALLY-ACTIVE 14-YEAR-OLD.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.734
I SHOULD GET
BACK IN THERE.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.836
- SO SHE
WAS HAVING SEX.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.572
- EMMY'S BOYFRIEND
TOLD US THAT...

23:25.605 --> 23:29.008
THEY TOOK A VOW
OF CELIBACY.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.713
- NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.482
MY SON AND EMMY
WEREN'T HAVING SEX.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.617
PLUS, I MEAN,
HE DOESN'T HAVE HERPES.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.951
- HAS HE BEEN TESTED?

23:38.985 --> 23:40.687
- WELL, NO, BUT HE JUST
HAD A CHECK-UP.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.623
AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO VOLUNTEER
FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT, BUT...

23:43.656 --> 23:47.159
I MEAN, HE'S 14 YEARS OLD.
HE STILL HAS HIS POKEMON CARDS.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.195
- DO YOU KNOW IF EMMY
HAD ANY OTHER BOYFRIENDS?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.830
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO ASK HER THAT.

23:50.863 --> 23:55.902
SHE TOLD ROB THAT HE WAS
THE FIRST BOY SHE EVER KISSED.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.537
- BUT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

23:57.570 --> 24:03.209
- EMMY CAME ON A LITTLE STRONG
TO MY SON, MOVING TOO FAST.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.111
- AND YOU SAW THIS
FIRST-HAND?

24:05.144 --> 24:08.848
- THERE WAS SOMETHING
VERY NEEDY ABOUT THAT GIRL.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.785
DESPERATE.
THE WAY SHE CLUNG TO MY SON

24:12.819 --> 24:15.655
LIKE A...BARNACLE.

24:15.688 --> 24:21.027
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HER PROBLEM WAS.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.262
- ABSENTEE MOTHER,
ADOLESCENT GIRL LEFT ALONE

24:23.295 --> 24:24.531
IN THE HOUSE
WITH HER FATHER.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.698
- WHO HAS
A DRINKING PROBLEM.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.766
- SAYS SHE'S A VIRGIN,

24:26.799 --> 24:28.868
BUT SOMEHOW CONTRACTED
GENITAL HERPES?

24:28.901 --> 24:34.807
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
WE TESTED A CORPSE FOR STDs.

24:37.844 --> 24:42.281
- CAPTAIN, A WORD?

24:42.314 --> 24:46.953
UM...SO I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME

24:46.986 --> 24:48.888
TO, UH--TO TALK.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.926
- YOUR BOOKIE MURPHY
RATTED YOU OUT.

24:53.960 --> 24:58.531
HE THOUGHT HAVING SOME DIRT
ON A DETECTIVE

24:58.565 --> 25:00.032
MIGHT HELP HIS CASE.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.802
I ALREADY CALLED I.A.B,
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT MURPHY

25:02.835 --> 25:03.903
HAVING ANY
LEVERAGE HERE.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.574
THEY'RE GOING
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

25:07.607 --> 25:11.544
ANYTHING ELSE I NEED
TO KNOW BEFORE THEY DO?

25:11.578 --> 25:12.779
MURPHY EVER ASK YOU
TO RUN A PLATE,

25:12.812 --> 25:14.814
CHECK SOMEBODY OUT?
- I GAMBLED,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.683
AND I--AND I LOST,
THAT'S IT.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.652
- YEAH? WELL, THEN,
YOU'RE LUCKY.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.754
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY,
HE WOULD HAVE,

25:21.788 --> 25:25.792
AND IF YOU WERE
DESPERATE ENOUGH...

25:25.825 --> 25:31.130
YOU UNDERSTAND...

25:31.163 --> 25:35.101
I REALLY SHOULD TAKE YOUR GUN
AND SHIELD RIGHT NOW.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.738
- YEAH...
- BUT I'M GONNA GO TO BAT

25:38.771 --> 25:43.175
FOR YOU WITH I.A.B, IF THIS
REALLY IS THE EXTENT OF IT.

25:43.209 --> 25:49.115
- CAPTAIN, IT IS.
I SWEAR.

25:49.148 --> 25:54.821
- THEN YOU'LL GET
A COMMAND DISCIPLINE,

25:54.854 --> 25:57.624
AND I'M GONNA TAKE
TEN VACATION DAYS,

25:57.657 --> 26:01.894
BUT, UH, FREE TIME
ISN'T REALLY YOUR FRIEND, IS IT?

26:01.928 --> 26:04.697
- I THINK THAT'S
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

26:08.067 --> 26:12.004
- LOOK...

26:12.038 --> 26:14.674
I GET IT.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.943
I BEEN EXACTLY
WHERE YOU ARE,

26:16.976 --> 26:19.912
I KNOW HOW THIS JOB
CAN WEIGH ON YOU.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.180
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:21.213 --> 26:24.016
- I USED TO DRINK.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.285
AND I MEAN DRINK.

26:26.318 --> 26:31.023
SOON AS I GOT OFF DUTY,
I WAS IN THE BAR POUNDING.

26:31.057 --> 26:34.026
AND THEN I STARTED
HAVING A FEW ON THE JOB.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.328
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO GET THROUGH.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.930
I THOUGHT
NOBODY NOTICED.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.835
MY CAPTAIN COULD'VE
CANNED MY ASS.

26:42.869 --> 26:46.673
SHOULD'VE.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.808
BUT HE GOT ME
HELP INSTEAD.

26:51.711 --> 26:56.182
- WOW.

26:56.215 --> 27:00.653
- YOU'RE A GOOD
DETECTIVE, AMANDA.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.888
I DON'T WANNA
END YOUR CAREER.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.291
- I DON'T WANT
THAT EITHER.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.793
- SO I'M GONNA
GET YOU HELP.

27:06.826 --> 27:11.430
BUT YOU SCREW UP AGAIN,
YOU'RE GONE.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.700
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.067
[knocking]
YEAH?

27:17.737 --> 27:19.672
WE GOOD?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.675
- WE CAN COME BACK.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.811
- NO, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

27:24.844 --> 27:28.681
- LAB REPORT ON SIDNEY
ECKHOUSE'S TISSUE SAMPLES

27:28.715 --> 27:30.216
FROM THE AUTOPSY.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.751
FATHER AND DAUGHTER
TESTED POSITIVE

27:31.784 --> 27:33.686
FOR THE SAME STRAIN
OF HERPES.

27:33.720 --> 27:38.357
- EVERY UNHAPPY FAMILY
IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.063
FIND OUT
WHO ELSE KNEW.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.940
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU
ON YOUR FEET.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.307
- I'M FEELING BETTER.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.410
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

27:58.444 --> 28:00.747
DID YOU FIND OUT
WHO KILLED MY PARENTS?

28:00.780 --> 28:02.982
- ACTUALLY, EMMY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

28:05.051 --> 28:08.287
- EXCUSE ME.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.455
- OKAY?

28:13.826 --> 28:17.329
EMMY, WE KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.699
- WHAT?

28:22.902 --> 28:27.774
NO--NO--NO, I MEAN...
NO, HE WASN'T THE BEST DAD

28:27.807 --> 28:30.009
IN THE WORLD, HE--
HE HAD HIS PROBLEMS, BUT--

28:30.042 --> 28:31.443
- EMMY, STOP, STOP.

28:31.477 --> 28:35.748
IT'S OKAY.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.485
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER FOR HIM ANYMORE.

28:39.518 --> 28:44.957
NOW WHATEVER HAPPENED,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.362
WHEN DID IT START?

28:54.333 --> 28:58.337
- LAST FEBRUARY.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.841
WE WENT SKIING
IN VERMONT.

29:01.874 --> 29:07.046
MY MOM HAD
TO LEAVE EARLY.

29:07.079 --> 29:12.384
JUST THE TWO OF US
IN THE CABIN THE FIRST NIGHT.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.054
HE'D BEEN DRINKING.

29:15.087 --> 29:20.026
- IS THAT THE ONLY TIME
THAT IT HAPPENED?

29:20.059 --> 29:24.430
- NO.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.266
NO, IT WASN'T.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.968
HE DRANK A LOT.

29:29.001 --> 29:33.272
LOOK, WHAT DOES
IT MATTER, ANYWAY?

29:33.305 --> 29:35.307
HE'S DEAD.

29:35.341 --> 29:40.479
- EMMY, DID YOU EVER TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON?

29:40.512 --> 29:45.284
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND, ROB,
DOES HE KNOW?

29:45.317 --> 29:50.056
- I HANDLED
IT MYSELF, OKAY?

29:50.089 --> 29:51.290
CAN YOU STOP NOW?

29:51.323 --> 29:56.963
- YOU'RE 14, EMMY.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.398
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.301
THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT YOU CAN TALK TO

30:02.334 --> 30:05.404
THAT WILL HELP YOU.
- YOU WANNA HELP ME?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.273
MAKE SURE ROB
NEVER FINDS OUT.

30:07.306 --> 30:10.542
I DON'T EVER WANT ROB TO KNOW.
HE'D BE DISGUSTED.

30:12.945 --> 30:17.549
PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.518
PLEASE.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.557
- SO SHE SAID
ROB DIDN'T KNOW,

30:25.591 --> 30:27.526
BUT SHE COULD
BE COVERING FOR HIM.

30:27.559 --> 30:31.497
- OKAY, SO HE SHOOTS THE FATHER
TO STOP THE INCEST. OKAY.

30:31.530 --> 30:36.435
BUT WHY SHOOT EMMY?
WE NEED TO RECHECK FORENSICS.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.404
- EMMY'S DAD?

30:38.437 --> 30:39.305
HE WAS TRYING
TO RULE HER WHOLE LIFE.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.909
KIND OF LIKE MY DAD.
- DON'T BE SMART.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.644
LOOK, MY SON HAS TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS, DETECTIVES.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.648
- WHAT ELSE DID
SHE TELL YOU, ROB?

30:49.681 --> 30:54.420
- NOTHING.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.555
HE WAS A JERK, YOU KNOW?
HE DRANK ALL DAY,

30:56.588 --> 30:59.525
WATCHED HIS GAMES.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.493
HIS LIFE WAS
REALLY MESSED UP,

31:01.527 --> 31:03.429
SO HE TOOK IT OUT ON HER.
ON US.

31:03.462 --> 31:08.367
- AND WHAT ABOUT WHEN
THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER,

31:08.400 --> 31:09.335
DID SHE TALK
ABOUT THAT?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.537
- NO, HE WAS DEPRESSING.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.040
- LOOK, YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.474
- KEEP GOING, ROB.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.675
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN "DEPRESSING"?

31:16.708 --> 31:20.980
- UH, AFTER THEY FIRED
THE HOUSEKEEPER CARMEN,

31:21.013 --> 31:22.982
SHE SPENT ALL
OF HER TIME OVER HERE.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.450
- SHE WAS CLOSE
TO CARMEN?

31:24.483 --> 31:25.985
- YEAH, REALLY CLOSE.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.386
I THINK SHE WAS MORE
OF A MOTHER TO HER

31:27.419 --> 31:29.421
THAN HER OWN MOTHER WAS.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.090
SHE'D--SHE'D SNEAK OUT
AND VISIT HER,

31:31.123 --> 31:34.493
BEG HER TO COME BACK
AND WORK FOR THEM.

31:34.526 --> 31:42.401
SHE COULDN'T STAND
BEING ALONE WITH HER FATHER.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.637
- EMMY TOLD US
ABOUT HER FATHER, CARMEN.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.407
- WE KNOW HOW CLOSE
YOU TWO ARE.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.309
AND WE KNOW
THAT SHE TOLD YOU.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.444
- HE WAS A SICK MAN.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.081
HE BROUGHT EVIL
ALL AROUND THE HOUSE,

31:55.114 --> 31:56.448
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF IT.

31:56.482 --> 32:00.652
- CARMEN, YOU LOVE EMMY.
AND IF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING

32:00.686 --> 32:04.390
TO PROTECT HER,
YOU WOULD, WOULDN'T YOU?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.193
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.028
SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
I HAD NOTHING TO DO

32:09.061 --> 32:11.097
WITH HER GETTING SHOT.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.499
- CARMEN TOLD YOU
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

32:13.532 --> 32:16.102
IN THAT HOUSE,
DIDN'T SHE?

32:16.135 --> 32:17.503
- BUT YOU'RE
A MAN OF GOD.

32:17.536 --> 32:22.508
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D KNOW
AND WOULDN'T HELP.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.544
- WHAT YOU BELIEVE
DOESN'T MATTER.

32:25.577 --> 32:31.417
[knocking]

32:36.155 --> 32:37.756
- THE FORENSICS REPORT
CAME IN.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.358
BOTH SIDNEY
AND EMMY'S DNA

32:39.391 --> 32:41.493
WERE ON THE BULLET
REMOVED FROM EMMY'S SKULL.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.529
- WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY SHE SURVIVED.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.097
BY THE TIME THE BULLET
WENT THROUGH SIDNEY

32:45.131 --> 32:47.666
AND HIT HER, IT DIDN'T
HAVE MUCH RESIDUAL ENERGY.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.235
- SO SHE WAS NEVER
THE TARGET.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.375
- THAT'S GOT TO BE WEIGHING
ON OUR PREACHER.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.586
SORRY ABOUT
THAT INTERRUPTION.

33:07.619 --> 33:13.725
THAT WAS OUR CAPTAIN.

33:13.759 --> 33:18.264
HE GAVE US
SOME BAD NEWS, JIMMY.

33:18.297 --> 33:23.602
EMMY DIDN'T MAKE IT.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.438
- WHAT?

33:26.472 --> 33:27.773
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.508
- WELL, SHE HAD
A POST-OP SEIZURE.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.577
SHE'S GONE.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.611
I'M SORRY.

33:32.644 --> 33:38.617
- CAN'T BE.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.287
THAT CAN'T BE PART
OF HIS PLAN.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.493
- DNA RESULTS CAME BACK,
JIMMY.

33:54.333 --> 33:58.537
IT'S GONNA EAT AWAY
AT YOU, JIMMY.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.172
YOU WANNA LIE
TO THE POLICE,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.708
IT'S OKAY.

34:02.741 --> 34:06.678
BUT GOD KNOWS THE TRUTH.
DIOS SE TODO.

34:06.712 --> 34:11.417
AND EMMY'S LOOKING DOWN
ON YOU RIGHT NOW.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.451
SHE KNOWS TOO.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.661
- [praying softly]

34:22.694 --> 34:26.532
- YOU WANT GOD
TO FORGIVE YOU?

34:26.565 --> 34:29.501
THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO FORGIVE YOURSELF FIRST.

34:29.535 --> 34:34.473
LOOK, YOU'RE
A PREACHER, RIGHT?

34:34.506 --> 34:36.142
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

34:36.175 --> 34:40.546
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.514
"IF WE CONFESS
OUR SINS...

34:42.548 --> 34:44.583
"THEN HE WHO
IS FAITHFUL AND JUST...

34:44.616 --> 34:46.352
WILL FORGIVE US
OUR SINS--"

34:46.385 --> 34:49.555
- "AND CLEANSE US
FROM ALL WICKEDNESS."

34:52.524 --> 34:55.594
THAT'S JOHN 1:9.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.629
YOU A BELIEVER?

34:57.663 --> 35:02.668
- [speaks Spanish]

35:07.573 --> 35:11.510
TIENE QUECONFESAR.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.513
RIGHT?

35:14.546 --> 35:18.317
IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA
GET RIGHT WITH THIS.

35:26.592 --> 35:29.428
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
I TRIED.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.598
I WENT TO HER MOTHER.
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.833
SHE THOUGHT I WAS JUST
GETTING BACK AT SIDNEY

35:34.866 --> 35:37.303
FOR FIRING ME.
- SO IS THAT WHEN...

35:37.336 --> 35:39.838
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
DECIDED TO BE HEROES

35:39.871 --> 35:41.773
AND KILL THE ECKHOUSES?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.809
- MY BROTHER?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.444
HE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.813
- NO? THEN WHY'D HE JUST
GIVE HIMSELF UP?

35:47.846 --> 35:51.583
HE SAID HE
PLANNED IT ALL.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.922
- HE'S LYING...

35:56.955 --> 36:02.294
TO PROTECT ME.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.431
IT WAS ALL MY IDEA.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.334
SIDNEY WAS RAPING HER.

36:10.936 --> 36:16.375
EMMY SAID SHE WAS THINKING
OF KILLING HERSELF.

36:16.408 --> 36:19.478
WE HAD TO SAVE HER.

36:19.511 --> 36:23.215
- THERE'S DEVILS.

36:23.249 --> 36:26.252
THERE'S DEVILS OUT THERE.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.220
I KNOW,
'CAUSE I USED TO BE ONE.

36:28.254 --> 36:32.224
MAN WASN'T RIGHT.

36:32.258 --> 36:35.627
I SHOT HIM.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.566
I SAW HER,
I KNEW SHE WAS THERE.

36:40.599 --> 36:45.237
RIGHT BEHIND.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.805
SHE WENT DOWN.

36:46.838 --> 36:52.544
IF I COULD TAKE THAT
BULLET MYSELF, I WOULD.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.480
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.715
SHE WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.884
- SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S, RIGHT?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.886
- I KNOW,
I KNOW...

37:00.919 --> 37:04.423
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.358
CARMEN?

37:06.392 --> 37:08.460
- WHAT? NO.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.662
UM...NO.
- THEN HOW'D YOU KNOW, JIMMY?

37:10.696 --> 37:11.697
- NO.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.044
- LOOK, EMMY COULD'VE
TOLD CARMEN IN PASSING

37:26.077 --> 37:27.446
THAT SHE'D BE
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE

37:27.479 --> 37:28.980
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
LIKE SMALL TALK.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.550
- OR SHE HELPED
SET IT UP.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.585
- WE NEED TO FIND OUT
IF SHE HAD A HAND IN THIS, LIV.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.587
- WELL, EVEN IF SHE DID,
SHE'S A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

37:35.621 --> 37:38.590
WHO WAS THE VICTIM
OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN HER OWN HOME.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.659
- AND THERE WERE OTHER WAYS
SHE COULD'VE HANDLED IT.

37:42.494 --> 37:47.065
LOOK, I HOPE TO GOD
SHE'S NOT INVOLVED,

37:47.098 --> 37:49.368
BUT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW
THROUGH ON THIS.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.879
- HI, EMMY.
- HEY.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.314
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:02.348 --> 38:04.483
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

38:07.653 --> 38:10.856
- EMMY, WE TALKED
TO CARMEN AND JIMMY...

38:10.889 --> 38:11.723
WHO CONFESSED.

38:11.757 --> 38:15.427
SO WE KNOW WHO KILLED
YOUR PARENTS.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.529
- JIMMY AND CARMEN?

38:17.563 --> 38:18.764
WHY--WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.500
- HE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.469
DOES HE?
- WHAT?

38:23.502 --> 38:27.539
WHAT DON'T I KNOW?
- EMMY...

38:27.573 --> 38:29.408
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TELL HIM

38:29.441 --> 38:30.609
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR FATHER.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.545
- NO, THAT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE.
- YOUR FATHER?

38:33.579 --> 38:34.646
EMMY, WHAT ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT?

38:40.886 --> 38:45.724
- I KNOW
THAT THIS IS HARD.

38:45.757 --> 38:51.062
BUT THERE WON'T BE ANY SECRETS
WHEN THIS GOES TO TRIAL.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.132
AND IT WILL
GO TO TRIAL.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.468
SO I THINK WE BOTH
KNOW IT'S BEST

38:56.502 --> 38:57.536
IF HE HEARS IT
FROM YOU.

39:04.610 --> 39:10.582
- MY DAD, HE--

39:10.616 --> 39:13.485
HE FORGOT THAT
I WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.987
- EMMY,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.624
- DON'T MAKE ME
SAY IT.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.027
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.595
- EMMY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME?

39:23.629 --> 39:24.730
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING TO ME?

39:24.763 --> 39:25.731
I COULD'VE HELPED YOU.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.466
- I WANTED TO BE
PURE FOR YOU.

39:27.499 --> 39:31.537
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I WAS DIRTY.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.638
- I WOULD'VE NEVER
THOUGHT THAT.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.039
I LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.509
- YOU KNOW...

39:37.543 --> 39:40.812
THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T GET.

39:40.846 --> 39:44.049
WHEN JIMMY CONFESSED,
HE KEPT SAYING, "I'M SORRY.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.917
I'M SORRY, SHE WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE."

39:45.951 --> 39:49.120
AND YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE,

39:49.154 --> 39:50.656
WERE YOU?
- NO.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.592
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AT MY HOUSE.

39:53.625 --> 39:57.028
- HOW DID HE
KNOW THAT, EMMY?

39:57.062 --> 40:02.133
- IT WASN'T PART
OF THE PLAN.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.105
- WHAT PLAN, EMMY?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.511
- CARMEN AND JIMMY
WERE TRYING TO SAVE ME.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.217
I TOLD THEM
FRIDAY NIGHT

40:19.250 --> 40:23.555
MY PARENTS
WOULD BOTH BE HOME.

40:23.589 --> 40:27.993
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AT ROB'S HOUSE.

40:28.026 --> 40:31.563
I TOLD THEM TO WRITE "QUEERS"
ON THE WALL

40:31.597 --> 40:34.099
SO THE POLICE WOULD THINK
IT WAS A HATE CRIME.

40:34.132 --> 40:38.904
- AND, LOOK,
YOUR FATHER, I GET.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.138
BUT YOUR MOTHER?

40:42.674 --> 40:45.043
- MY FATHER
WAS JUST PATHETIC,

40:45.076 --> 40:49.648
HE COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.
BUT MY MOM?

40:49.681 --> 40:51.617
I HATED HER
MORE THAN HIM.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.486
- SHE KNEW.

40:54.520 --> 40:58.123
- SHE LET IT HAPPEN.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.591
CARMEN TRIED
TO TELL HER.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.594
I TRIED.

41:02.628 --> 41:08.534
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT
SHE'S SOME KIND OF HERO.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.503
BUT SHE WAS MORE WORRIED
ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD

41:11.537 --> 41:14.506
THAN SHE WAS ABOUT SAVING
HER OWN DAUGHTER.

41:18.844 --> 41:22.748
- EMMY--
- NO.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.149
- WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ARREST YOU.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.784
- PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.
- IT'S OKAY.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.085
- PLEASE DON'T
TAKE HER FROM ME.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.622
- IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.692
I'M FREE.
I'M FREE.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.698
I'M FREE NOW.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.851
- YOU'RE HERE.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.520
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP.
