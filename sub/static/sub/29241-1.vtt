01:18.639 --> 01:19.647
I talked to Vivian.

01:19.649 --> 01:21.772
She said Madison made head cheerleader.

01:22.769 --> 01:23.732
Good for Madison.

01:23.989 --> 01:25.432
Could be good for you too.

01:26.569 --> 01:28.419
Maybe she could get you on the squad.

01:28.449 --> 01:29.882
I'm not interested.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.289
Aw, come on, you'd look so cute

01:32.369 --> 01:33.919
in one of those little outfits.

01:34.409 --> 01:35.459
Never gonna happen.

01:36.928 --> 01:39.077
Oh, my God, Jesus.

01:39.079 --> 01:41.047
The car in front of
me just stopped short.

01:41.049 --> 01:42.957
Because there's a stop sign.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.377
You should be more alert.

01:44.379 --> 01:45.987
Well maybe if you were
actually teaching me

01:45.989 --> 01:48.712
how to drive and not
putting on your lipstick.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.982
I think you inherited the
bad driving gene from me.

01:53.019 --> 01:54.597
No, I just need more practice.

01:54.599 --> 01:56.712
You promised we'd go twice a week.

01:56.729 --> 01:59.329
Why don't you get a
boyfriend to drive you around.

01:59.346 --> 02:01.546
Right, right, your
solution to everything.

02:01.753 --> 02:04.630
Well when I was your age, I had several.

02:04.632 --> 02:05.942
What about Evan?

02:06.129 --> 02:07.792
Evan doesn't drive.

02:07.939 --> 02:10.431
Anyway, the person has to be over 25.

02:11.158 --> 02:12.608
Why don't you ask your dad?

02:13.279 --> 02:15.029
You'll mind him, he has a daughter.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.362
God!

02:25.142 --> 02:27.309
Hey, learn how to drive!

02:32.058 --> 02:34.725
Oh, that must be Silvia's son.

02:38.093 --> 02:39.010
Poor thing.

02:48.759 --> 02:50.052
You must be Vince.

02:50.239 --> 02:51.672
Uh, yeah.

02:52.289 --> 02:54.112
So good to finally meet you.

02:54.449 --> 02:56.324
Your mom told me so much about you.

02:56.326 --> 02:57.452
And you are?

02:57.459 --> 02:58.596
- I'm Nancy.
- Oh.

02:58.849 --> 03:01.089
I live next door, and your mom

03:01.609 --> 03:03.162
was a wonderful friend.

03:03.429 --> 03:05.777
Aw, thank you, it's
very nice of you to say.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.429
And this is Sarah, my daughter.

03:07.637 --> 03:08.612
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:09.199 --> 03:10.032
She's shy.

03:10.701 --> 03:11.967
So how long you gonna stay?

03:11.969 --> 03:13.357
Just to get the place ready.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.192
Ready?

03:14.509 --> 03:15.652
We're selling it.

03:17.659 --> 03:18.492
Of course.

03:19.269 --> 03:20.277
Is Elizabeth coming?

03:20.279 --> 03:22.022
No no no, just me for now.

03:23.309 --> 03:26.607
Well, please, if
there's anything you need,

03:26.609 --> 03:28.482
don't hesitate to come by.

03:29.116 --> 03:29.977
Okay, I appreciate that.

03:29.979 --> 03:33.282
Just me and Sarah, don't be a stranger.

03:33.949 --> 03:36.212
All right, it was nice meeting you both.

03:36.340 --> 03:37.173
You too.

03:41.656 --> 03:42.487
What?

03:42.489 --> 03:43.322
He's cute.

03:43.859 --> 03:45.542
He's younger than you.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.673
So?

03:46.829 --> 03:49.512
So, isn't that
like against your rules?

03:50.379 --> 03:51.562
You do have a point.

03:52.549 --> 03:54.749
I don't have time to
waste on a younger man.

03:55.719 --> 03:57.469
Glad you've thought this through.

03:57.699 --> 03:58.692
I'm going in.

04:00.099 --> 04:00.932
Come on.

04:05.483 --> 04:08.809
Curvy, feminine, fun-loving woman

04:09.149 --> 04:11.642
in her mid-40s,

04:12.029 --> 04:13.969
no, in her

04:15.969 --> 04:16.802
prime.

04:17.849 --> 04:19.742
Looking, hey, Sarah!

04:21.209 --> 04:22.041
Sarah!

04:22.259 --> 04:23.090
What?

04:23.092 --> 04:23.923
Will you come here a minute?

04:23.925 --> 04:25.489
I wanna show you something.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.833
For a,

04:28.019 --> 04:30.142
should I, come here, I wanna show you.

04:30.529 --> 04:31.540
Look, come here.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.537
Mom, I really wanna finish this piece.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.127
Oh, you can take a break from your

04:35.129 --> 04:36.827
painting for one second.

04:36.829 --> 04:38.452
Just come here, look.

04:39.509 --> 04:40.340
All right, what do you think that...

04:40.342 --> 04:42.653
Is that, curvy woman in her prime?

04:42.655 --> 04:45.137
All right, look, can you
please take a picture?

04:45.139 --> 04:46.786
Because, I tried to take...

04:47.379 --> 04:48.807
Can you just take a selfie?

04:48.809 --> 04:51.452
I did, look at this, it's terrible.

04:51.829 --> 04:53.602
Yeah, you have to hold it higher.

04:56.139 --> 04:57.602
Up, higher.

04:58.869 --> 04:59.700
Yeah.

04:59.702 --> 05:00.709
Is that how they do that?

05:00.989 --> 05:01.822
See?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.269
Good, okay, have fun.

06:20.122 --> 06:22.705
Hi, Vince, it's Mom.

06:23.879 --> 06:25.762
I just spoke with Margot.

06:26.239 --> 06:28.854
Honey, I hope you're doing all right.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.800
Call me back, sweetheart.

06:40.054 --> 06:41.887
Vince, it's Mom again.

06:42.189 --> 06:44.222
Why aren't you returning my calls?

06:45.059 --> 06:47.037
I hope you're taking care of yourself.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.482
I know how you can get.

06:50.009 --> 06:50.842
Call me.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.003
Love you.

07:51.979 --> 07:52.810
Hey.

07:52.812 --> 07:53.799
I'm outside.

07:54.339 --> 07:55.172
I'm busy.

07:55.249 --> 07:57.012
Come on, open up.

07:57.330 --> 07:58.163
Ohhh.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.817
So I wonder if Sarah will go

08:07.819 --> 08:08.887
to the new Transformers tonight.

08:08.889 --> 08:09.889
Forget it.

08:10.469 --> 08:11.469
Come on it'll fun.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.732
No, I wanna keep working on this.

08:13.999 --> 08:14.832
Can I see it?

08:15.589 --> 08:16.422
No.

08:16.949 --> 08:17.842
Come on.

08:18.839 --> 08:19.912
Show it to me.

08:20.659 --> 08:21.492
Just once.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.402
Dream on.

08:35.539 --> 08:36.373
Oh my God.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.552
Are you okay?

08:43.759 --> 08:45.152
I'm fine, thank you.

08:47.349 --> 08:48.542
Let me help you.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.414
Oh no no no no no no, ow, don't do that.

08:50.416 --> 08:51.247
Oh sorry.

08:51.249 --> 08:52.082
It's okay, it's okay.

08:53.259 --> 08:54.092
Gosh.

08:54.788 --> 08:56.347
Oh, I don't know how
I'm gonna get this place

08:56.349 --> 08:57.207
cleaned up in a month.

08:57.209 --> 08:58.042
A month?

08:58.759 --> 09:00.817
Yeah, actually a little less than that.

09:00.819 --> 09:02.852
Oh my God, you need help.

09:03.759 --> 09:05.082
Hold on, Sarah?

09:06.329 --> 09:07.922
Check out this video,
it's just a little fuzzy.

09:09.263 --> 09:10.596
Sarah?

09:11.739 --> 09:12.572
What?

09:13.249 --> 09:15.257
Can you come
down and join us please?

09:15.259 --> 09:16.257
Evan's here.

09:16.259 --> 09:17.852
It's okay, just for a second.

09:19.599 --> 09:20.432
Fine.

09:21.549 --> 09:22.382
Come on.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.189
I have a great idea.

09:28.099 --> 09:28.932
What's up?

09:29.299 --> 09:32.357
Vince just told me that
he's only got a few days,

09:32.359 --> 09:35.312
well a few weeks, to
clean out his mom's house.

09:35.789 --> 09:36.620
Okay.

09:36.622 --> 09:38.572
And you need driving lessons.

09:38.889 --> 09:41.621
Oh, I doubt that she
wants to spend her summer

09:41.623 --> 09:43.066
cleaning up my mom's, I
don't think that's a...

09:43.068 --> 09:44.257
If she wants to get
her license, she does.

09:44.259 --> 09:45.527
I've been very busy.

09:45.529 --> 09:47.977
Maybe if you didn't
go on all those dates.

09:47.979 --> 09:48.997
Honey, please.

09:48.999 --> 09:50.284
Thank you, but I'll
figure it out, I will.

09:50.286 --> 09:52.572
You really need help, don't you?

09:52.759 --> 09:55.092
And you really want
driving lessons, right?

09:55.449 --> 09:56.902
So now's your chance.

09:58.949 --> 09:59.782
Perfect.

09:59.949 --> 10:02.197
Okay, I gotta go, so
why don't you help Vince

10:02.199 --> 10:03.722
clean up this mess now?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.271
You stink.

10:08.639 --> 10:09.532
I gotta bounce.

10:11.929 --> 10:14.579
You don't have to do this,
you do know that, right?

10:15.919 --> 10:18.832
It's the only way I'll get
my license before I'm 30.

10:21.049 --> 10:22.527
But if I'm in your way, then I...

10:22.529 --> 10:25.237
No no no no, no, I could
actually use the help,

10:25.239 --> 10:26.189
so that'd be great.

10:27.129 --> 10:27.962
Okay.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.167
How about we get started tomorrow?

10:30.169 --> 10:33.372
That'll give me a day to organize things.

10:34.789 --> 10:35.620
Okay?

10:35.622 --> 10:36.453
Sure.

10:36.455 --> 10:37.288
Cool.

10:39.949 --> 10:40.782
See ya.

11:00.469 --> 11:03.346
I need a sexy, this is not a sexy one.

11:28.097 --> 11:29.251
Hey.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.982
Oh, hey, how are you?

11:32.096 --> 11:35.192
At least you organized all this stuff.

11:36.769 --> 11:39.352
Yeah, I didn't quite
get as far as I had hoped.

11:40.819 --> 11:42.122
So where should I start?

11:43.260 --> 11:44.732
Uh, good question.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.039
Let me show you around, and
then we can figure it out, yeah?

11:49.579 --> 11:50.929
Cool, watch your head here.

11:52.259 --> 11:54.667
So we need to go through all these.

11:54.669 --> 11:56.707
I think most of this side and that there

11:56.709 --> 11:58.232
is probably my mom's stuff.

11:59.599 --> 12:01.647
My sister should be coming
sometime in the next week

12:01.649 --> 12:02.867
or two to get her stuff too.

12:02.869 --> 12:04.862
And yeah, so, I guess that's it.

12:05.509 --> 12:06.902
Sorry, so that's,

12:07.839 --> 12:08.670
tight quarters.

12:08.672 --> 12:10.892
That's the tour, I guess.

12:14.919 --> 12:15.752
Ohh.

12:18.449 --> 12:21.052
So, what do you do in the real world?

12:22.659 --> 12:25.012
I'm getting my PhD in philosophy.

12:25.789 --> 12:26.622
Cool.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.529
How long does something like that take?

12:30.889 --> 12:31.979
In my case, like

12:33.709 --> 12:34.542
eight years.

12:35.719 --> 12:38.372
Is it supposed to take that long?

12:38.518 --> 12:40.018
No, not exactly.

12:40.364 --> 12:41.414
So what's it about?

12:42.369 --> 12:43.202
Ethics.

12:44.269 --> 12:45.422
What about ethics?

12:45.829 --> 12:47.379
Acting on the motive of duty.

12:47.459 --> 12:50.209
Basically, arguing that we
can always do what is right.

12:52.391 --> 12:54.322
But what if you don't know what's right?

12:54.469 --> 12:55.977
Well, once you recognize
what you oughta do,

12:55.979 --> 12:57.379
then you can actually do it.

12:58.359 --> 13:00.597
Okay, but what if I
think is right isn't what

13:00.599 --> 13:02.012
other people think is right?

13:02.389 --> 13:04.262
Who decides what's right anyway?

13:05.469 --> 13:07.662
I guess you'll just
have to read my thesis.

13:08.679 --> 13:10.222
Yeah, I'd like that.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.999
No, you probably
wouldn't actually.

13:15.199 --> 13:16.912
So how do you like Findlay?

13:20.029 --> 13:20.862
Whatever.

13:21.769 --> 13:24.262
The teachers are good,
they pretend to care.

13:24.729 --> 13:27.222
I don't know, I'm just
ready for whatever's next.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.367
When I was there, all anyone cared about

13:30.369 --> 13:32.097
was football, or theater.

13:32.099 --> 13:32.979
Or theater?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.022
Then nothing's changed.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.299
So what is next?

13:39.569 --> 13:43.337
Oh, um, I guess I'll
start on one of these boxes.

13:43.339 --> 13:46.362
No no no, you said you're
ready for whatever's next.

13:48.029 --> 13:50.002
I'd like to travel.

13:52.769 --> 13:54.572
Go to Europe, see some art.

13:54.729 --> 13:56.987
Europe's great, I
spent some time in Spain

13:56.989 --> 13:58.989
after undergrad, actually almost stayed.

13:59.219 --> 14:01.282
I'd like to go to Germany and Austria.

14:01.399 --> 14:02.399
What's in Austria?

14:02.559 --> 14:04.359
My favorite painters are Austrian.

14:05.009 --> 14:07.752
Like Egon Schiele, Kokoscha.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.589
No idea, never heard of them.

14:11.659 --> 14:14.022
They've totally shaped my style.

14:14.089 --> 14:15.989
I guess that sounds pretentious but

14:17.258 --> 14:19.067
there's just this intensity to their work,

14:19.069 --> 14:20.482
like it grabs you.

14:21.089 --> 14:22.767
I want people to feel something

14:22.769 --> 14:24.482
when they look at my paintings.

14:27.069 --> 14:28.732
So what do you think about this guy?

14:29.329 --> 14:32.092
Mm, no comment.

14:32.749 --> 14:36.037
What, this beautiful
explosion of primary colors

14:36.039 --> 14:36.962
doesn't move you?

14:37.269 --> 14:38.102
Come on.

14:38.649 --> 14:39.899
So what, donate?

14:42.259 --> 14:43.422
Is it that bad?

14:43.639 --> 14:44.472
Trash?

14:44.599 --> 14:45.599
It's for the best.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.205
You're killing me.

15:05.591 --> 15:08.180
(Nancy laughing

15:08.252 --> 15:10.002
Shh, don't wake up Sarah.

15:10.554 --> 15:11.574
We wouldn't want that.

15:11.576 --> 15:12.642
Nooo.

15:17.061 --> 15:17.894
Stop it.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.457
Hey hey hey hey, hold on, hold on.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.159
I got it, let me get that for you.

16:18.181 --> 16:19.931
- Thanks.
- Of course.

16:20.198 --> 16:21.031
Ahhh.

16:21.829 --> 16:25.082
This trade-off requires no heavy
lifting for you, all right?

16:25.129 --> 16:25.962
Got it.

16:26.649 --> 16:27.492
Who's hungry?

16:30.919 --> 16:33.402
What happened to your girlfriend, Vince?

16:33.509 --> 16:34.847
I mean, your mother made it sound like

16:34.849 --> 16:36.132
it was pretty serious.

16:36.509 --> 16:37.659
Just didn't work out.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.022
Wanna be more specific?

16:40.349 --> 16:41.599
No, not really.

16:43.809 --> 16:45.167
I'll find someone for you.

16:45.169 --> 16:46.000
I'm good.

16:46.002 --> 16:47.549
I mean, if I were 10 years younger,

16:47.809 --> 16:50.316
I woulda found her already if
you know what I mean.

16:51.059 --> 16:52.859
Everyone knows what you mean, Mom.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.112
Mm-hmm.

16:55.089 --> 16:56.939
There is a girl at work, though, that

16:57.209 --> 16:59.259
I really like, she's nice and pretty and,

16:59.869 --> 17:00.919
I think she's single.

17:01.909 --> 17:04.317
I'm good, I'm kinda taking
a break from relationships

17:04.319 --> 17:06.118
right now, but thanks for the offer.

17:06.169 --> 17:07.662
You're almost 40.

17:08.479 --> 17:11.329
You don't have time to take
a break, don't you want kids?

17:11.809 --> 17:14.012
I don't know, I can't
really answer that question.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.267
It's the greatest
pleasure of life, look,

17:16.269 --> 17:18.112
well not that she's a prime example.

17:18.128 --> 17:21.017
Sarah's actually
been a huge help already.

17:21.019 --> 17:22.219
She's been really great.

17:23.039 --> 17:24.489
That's a nice thing to say.

17:25.009 --> 17:27.311
I am really glad this
is working out so well.

17:27.950 --> 17:28.900
Okay, I have to go.

17:28.999 --> 17:29.972
Be good, you two.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.849
Bye, thank you for the food, Nancy.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.182
You're welcome.

17:33.439 --> 17:34.592
Interesting woman.

17:35.919 --> 17:37.792
She certainly has a lot of energy.

17:38.549 --> 17:40.049
That's a nice way to put it.

17:41.896 --> 17:43.207
So what do you say we drive this stuff

17:43.209 --> 17:44.259
to Goodwill tomorrow?

17:44.899 --> 17:45.732
Yeah.

17:46.879 --> 17:49.372
No, I meant, I meant you drive it.

17:49.689 --> 17:50.522
Oh.

17:50.619 --> 17:52.142
Yeah, okay.

17:52.679 --> 17:53.677
I mean, that's the deal, right?

17:53.679 --> 17:54.587
Isn't that we agreed to?

17:54.589 --> 17:55.422
Yeah, mm-hmm.

17:55.609 --> 17:56.442
Cool.

18:00.099 --> 18:01.612
Is she always that chatty?

18:02.569 --> 18:03.402
Yeah.

18:04.069 --> 18:05.219
And full of opinions?

18:05.909 --> 18:06.742
Yup.

18:09.499 --> 18:10.332
Hey.

18:11.077 --> 18:12.352
What the fuck?

18:12.606 --> 18:14.852
The door was open,
didn't you get my text?

18:15.639 --> 18:17.052
No, I was helping Vince.

18:17.549 --> 18:18.382
Who?

18:19.119 --> 18:21.182
Vince, the guy next door.

18:22.129 --> 18:22.962
Oh.

18:26.694 --> 18:27.844
Anyway, this is shit.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.035
Close the door.

19:00.648 --> 19:02.823
Where did that come from?

19:43.428 --> 19:44.261
Ohhh.

19:57.916 --> 19:59.342
It's not raining.

20:00.839 --> 20:02.392
Oops, is that better?

20:02.642 --> 20:04.492
I think that's how they go.

20:05.376 --> 20:10.376
It's all right.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.107
Just focus on the driving.

20:12.109 --> 20:13.709
I'll cover the music, all right?

20:13.879 --> 20:14.712
Okay.

20:16.369 --> 20:17.596
That's better, right?

20:29.419 --> 20:31.022
Let's go to the one in Glendale?

20:31.029 --> 20:31.957
There's one in Riverside.

20:31.959 --> 20:34.357
Yeah, but that'll give
us more time to practice.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.622
Oh, okay.

20:36.683 --> 20:37.514
Is that cool?

20:37.516 --> 20:38.349
Yeah.

20:40.091 --> 20:43.886
You can go faster than three
miles an hour if you want.

21:04.821 --> 21:06.238
Can I have one?

21:22.039 --> 21:24.322
Do not tell your mom, all right?

21:24.739 --> 21:26.677
So you know you shouldn't
give me a cigarette,

21:26.679 --> 21:27.932
but you did anyway.

21:29.889 --> 21:30.957
So now you're gonna give me shit?

21:30.959 --> 21:33.159
You want me to take it back?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.561
I don't know, all that
talk about your thesis.

21:35.829 --> 21:38.232
The right thing to do, what we oughta do.

21:38.516 --> 21:42.349
Now you know why it's
taking me eight years.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.174
Oh, shit.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.312
You scared me.

23:31.352 --> 23:33.557
Your mom said to come get
you, didn't mean to interrupt.

23:33.559 --> 23:34.392
Sorry.

23:36.929 --> 23:38.652
Hey, that's me.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.769
Do you like it?

23:42.119 --> 23:44.132
I mean, I expected you to be good,

23:45.459 --> 23:46.652
but not this good.

23:47.999 --> 23:49.652
I like how thick the paint is.

23:51.324 --> 23:52.724
You almost want to touch it.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.222
Go ahead.

23:56.009 --> 23:58.009
Nah, I wouldn't wanna ruin it.

23:58.659 --> 24:00.482
I can fix it if you do.

24:06.489 --> 24:07.320
Cool.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.202
Ah, so I'm ready whenever you are.

24:10.459 --> 24:13.297
Okay, um, I'll be right over.

24:13.299 --> 24:14.132
Awesome.

24:29.229 --> 24:30.879
You can go a little bit faster.

24:31.254 --> 24:36.254
You don't have to drive so slow.

24:37.629 --> 24:39.327
Watch this intersection.

24:39.329 --> 24:40.999
You're good, you're good.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.168
Who is this?

24:42.238 --> 24:43.988
It's Onramp Lovers.

24:45.076 --> 24:46.076
I like it.

24:46.131 --> 24:47.390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I discovered them

24:47.392 --> 24:48.530
at a music festival a couple years ago.

24:48.532 --> 24:49.762
With your girlfriend?

24:50.479 --> 24:51.310
Left here.

24:51.312 --> 24:52.702
Come on, you're no fun.

24:53.499 --> 24:54.932
Stop, stop, no.

24:55.659 --> 24:56.490
It's green.

24:56.492 --> 24:58.642
Sarah, no, you're
not, I said stop, okay.

25:00.576 --> 25:02.676
Put your hands back on the steering wheel.

25:03.259 --> 25:05.192
Put your hands on the wheel.

25:05.209 --> 25:07.309
Just calm down, is your foot on the brake?

25:07.619 --> 25:08.450
Yes.

25:08.452 --> 25:09.587
All right, now do not do anything

25:09.589 --> 25:11.082
until I tell you to, okay?

25:12.459 --> 25:13.509
Keep your blinker on.

25:14.455 --> 25:15.286
God.

25:15.288 --> 25:16.121
Are you ready?

25:16.269 --> 25:17.332
Okay, now go.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.147
Perfect, perfect.

25:23.149 --> 25:24.122
Are you all right?

25:24.179 --> 25:26.632
No, I don't, no, I
don't wanna drive anymore.

25:26.649 --> 25:27.577
Hey, hey, hey, okay, up here,

25:27.579 --> 25:28.822
just pull in up here.

25:29.079 --> 25:30.229
Just pull in over here.

25:38.619 --> 25:39.469
That was awful.

25:39.479 --> 25:41.079
Hey, hey, these things happen,

25:41.229 --> 25:42.629
that's why we're doing this.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.069
Look at me, look at me.

25:45.639 --> 25:48.087
I'm sorry that I yelled
at you, I didn't mean to.

25:48.089 --> 25:48.922
Okay?

26:07.686 --> 26:08.517
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

26:08.519 --> 26:11.852
Can you please just, Sarah, please.

26:14.086 --> 26:16.169
Just get back in the car.

26:17.027 --> 26:18.613
Get back in the car.

26:48.434 --> 26:50.267
Put your seat belt on.

27:29.532 --> 27:31.449
So this is my attempt to look

27:33.009 --> 27:34.132
sexy for

27:35.979 --> 27:36.832
you know who.

27:38.039 --> 27:40.712
Outfit of the day, as they say.

27:41.759 --> 27:43.279
Hashtag OOTD.

27:47.529 --> 27:48.702
You look nice.

27:50.109 --> 27:50.942
Thanks.

27:51.349 --> 27:52.249
Where you going?

27:53.209 --> 27:54.042
Vince's.

27:54.589 --> 27:55.522
I need a ride.

27:56.839 --> 27:58.312
What is Vince's deal?

27:58.659 --> 27:59.609
What do you mean?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.479
What happened to his girlfriend?

28:01.619 --> 28:02.452
I don't know.

28:03.609 --> 28:05.142
What, don't you guys talk?

28:05.609 --> 28:08.252
Yeah, but not about stuff like that.

28:08.739 --> 28:09.989
What do you talk about?

28:10.649 --> 28:12.062
Like art,

28:12.239 --> 28:13.522
travel,

28:13.839 --> 28:15.489
he said he almost moved to Spain.

28:15.875 --> 28:19.282
Oh, no wonder he's single.

28:20.229 --> 28:21.179
What do you mean?

28:21.239 --> 28:24.012
Well, gallivanting all around Europe,

28:24.179 --> 28:25.792
instead of settling down.

28:26.299 --> 28:28.392
Maybe he's not ready to settle down.

28:29.017 --> 28:30.232
He's almost 40.

28:30.619 --> 28:33.187
So? Not everyone feels the same way

28:33.189 --> 28:35.142
about timelines as you do.

28:35.729 --> 28:37.329
You don't have to protect him.

28:37.529 --> 28:38.852
I'm not judging him.

28:39.499 --> 28:41.342
You judge everyone.

28:41.889 --> 28:43.842
Nancy, the doctor will see you now.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.082
Oh, thank you.

28:45.609 --> 28:46.440
Nice to see you.

28:46.442 --> 28:47.275
You too.

28:58.259 --> 28:59.092
Sarah?

29:01.314 --> 29:02.731
Okay, right here.

29:03.632 --> 29:05.357
I'm so excited,
I can't wait to see...

29:05.359 --> 29:06.882
Hi, sweetie.

29:07.169 --> 29:08.162
I'm Dr. Burke.

29:09.679 --> 29:10.512
Hi.

29:11.579 --> 29:12.602
Are you okay?

29:13.109 --> 29:14.159
Of course, sweetie.

29:14.819 --> 29:17.152
You have a very hip mother.

29:18.689 --> 29:20.737
I finally figured out what to give you

29:20.739 --> 29:22.342
for your graduation gift.

29:22.699 --> 29:24.712
Grad, it's not for a while.

29:24.859 --> 29:25.809
Why wait?

29:27.559 --> 29:29.362
Okay, what is it?

29:30.639 --> 29:31.472
Guess.

29:32.469 --> 29:33.302
A car?

29:33.579 --> 29:34.412
No.

29:36.018 --> 29:37.312
A trip to Europe?

29:37.624 --> 29:38.457
No.

29:39.869 --> 29:41.637
Matching lip injections.

29:41.639 --> 29:44.902
Dr. Burke has a cancellation,
he can do us both now.

29:46.319 --> 29:48.912
I don't want lip injections.

29:49.979 --> 29:51.952
It's virtually a painless procedure.

29:52.259 --> 29:53.622
Just right at the top.

29:54.039 --> 29:56.217
Never mind, I'm gonna go wait outside.

29:56.219 --> 29:57.997
Wait, it'll be years before you

29:57.999 --> 29:59.549
can afford something like this.

30:00.699 --> 30:01.787
It's my treat.

30:01.789 --> 30:02.622
No, Mom.

30:04.432 --> 30:06.052
You never listen.

30:06.459 --> 30:09.002
I don't want it, God, no wonder Dad left.

30:14.343 --> 30:18.593
That's not why he left.

30:22.519 --> 30:23.350
Hey.

30:23.352 --> 30:24.185
Can I come in.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.819
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not funny.

30:30.879 --> 30:31.710
What is wrong with her?

30:31.712 --> 30:33.107
She's fucking crazy.

30:33.109 --> 30:34.402
Hey, hey, easy.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.792
Go easy on her, okay?

30:37.379 --> 30:39.907
Someday, way before you're
ready, she'll be gone

30:39.909 --> 30:41.257
and you'll regret all the shitty things

30:41.259 --> 30:43.882
you said about her, believe me.

30:47.309 --> 30:49.277
Anyway, I'm sure she only
wants the best for you.

30:49.279 --> 30:50.847
What is that supposed to mean?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.382
I don't know, it's just
what people say about parents.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.219
She probably does, though,

30:55.499 --> 30:57.072
just has no idea what that is.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.232
I just, I need to get outta here.

30:59.809 --> 31:01.251
You'll be on your
own before you know it.

31:01.253 --> 31:03.322
No, like I need to get outta here, now.

31:06.149 --> 31:07.617
Sorry about yesterday.

31:07.619 --> 31:08.452
I know.

31:10.162 --> 31:13.346
So we're cool, we're all good, right?

31:13.609 --> 31:14.442
Yeah.

31:14.672 --> 31:15.505
Awesome.

31:24.269 --> 31:26.119
Do you think I need lip injections?

31:26.889 --> 31:28.012
Absolutely not.

31:28.519 --> 31:29.932
No, definitely not.

31:33.342 --> 31:34.175
Uhhh.

31:35.180 --> 31:37.744
I mean, maybe a nose job, but
definitely not lip injections.

31:37.746 --> 31:38.577
What?

31:38.579 --> 31:39.862
I'm kidding.

31:40.309 --> 31:41.140
I was kidding.

31:41.142 --> 31:42.997
- You're an asshole.
- It was a joke.

31:42.999 --> 31:45.717
Just kidding around, come
on, you know you're beautiful.

31:45.719 --> 31:47.502
I mean, you know what I mean.

31:48.162 --> 31:50.662
I'm sure guys your age
find you very pretty.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.045
Thanks.

31:54.999 --> 31:55.832
Of course.

31:58.659 --> 32:01.702
Ah, this should be it right here.

32:04.749 --> 32:05.582
Shit.

32:07.899 --> 32:10.549
I can't believe it, I used
to come here all the time.

32:12.149 --> 32:12.982
Can I drive?

32:14.039 --> 32:15.439
Where, where you wanna go?

32:16.233 --> 32:17.442
It's a surprise.

32:18.888 --> 32:19.888
All right.

32:20.153 --> 32:20.986
Switch.

32:29.371 --> 32:30.204
Careful.

32:55.499 --> 32:58.249
So what are you gonna do
when you finish your thesis?

32:59.949 --> 33:01.502
Teach, I guess.

33:02.611 --> 33:03.444
You guess?

33:05.716 --> 33:06.816
There aren't a lotta

33:07.739 --> 33:09.862
job listings for philosophers these days.

33:11.209 --> 33:13.109
Is that why you went to grad school?

33:15.629 --> 33:17.792
I did it honestly,

33:19.229 --> 33:20.812
because I didn't know what else to do.

33:22.559 --> 33:23.767
Which is why you should take the time now

33:23.769 --> 33:25.369
to figure that out for yourself.

33:26.229 --> 33:27.062
Or,

33:28.809 --> 33:31.392
focus on painting.

33:31.699 --> 33:34.127
My mom thinks I'd be
crazy to try and make

33:34.129 --> 33:35.792
a living as an artist.

33:36.949 --> 33:40.952
She says there's too many
talented people out there,

33:41.318 --> 33:42.518
and who am I to make it?

33:43.974 --> 33:45.324
That portrait that I saw?

33:46.019 --> 33:47.146
It was great.

33:48.398 --> 33:49.231
Really?

33:49.319 --> 33:50.152
Yeah.

33:51.388 --> 33:53.305
You're really talented.

33:53.442 --> 33:55.842
Well you're like the
only person that gets me.

33:58.279 --> 33:59.479
I doubt that.

34:04.099 --> 34:05.099
This place is great.

34:06.151 --> 34:06.984
It's nice.

34:09.119 --> 34:10.237
My dad used to bring me here

34:10.239 --> 34:12.862
whenever he needed to
get away from my mom.

34:14.029 --> 34:15.822
So this was a regular thing?

34:17.039 --> 34:18.688
Yeah, it was pretty much daily.

34:24.469 --> 34:26.192
Now he won't even call me back.

34:29.348 --> 34:30.848
Do you miss him?

34:32.268 --> 34:33.369
I get why he left.

34:36.018 --> 34:36.851
Right.

34:38.416 --> 34:40.083
But do you miss him?

34:42.649 --> 34:43.681
Yeah, I guess.

34:46.139 --> 34:48.092
I don't know, I don't really feel much.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.456
It's none of my business.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.722
But even if he doesn't
wanna be with your mom,

34:58.894 --> 35:00.644
he is still your dad.

35:01.456 --> 35:03.857
So he should be there for you.

35:13.995 --> 35:16.578
You're not supposed to do that.

35:16.985 --> 35:17.818
I know.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.594
You really are beautiful.

36:39.896 --> 36:44.012
You did say guys my age
would find me very pretty.

36:45.892 --> 36:48.676
You know what I meant.

37:33.629 --> 37:35.579
Where the hell have you been?

37:36.109 --> 37:36.942
Out.

37:37.209 --> 37:39.192
Out is not an answer!

37:39.769 --> 37:41.362
What do you want from me?

37:41.709 --> 37:44.047
When I stay in, you complain
that I don't go out enough,

37:44.049 --> 37:45.797
and when I do go out, you give me shit.

37:45.799 --> 37:47.722
It is one o'clock in the morning.

37:48.749 --> 37:50.187
You wouldn't care if you'd gone out,

37:50.189 --> 37:52.142
but since you look like that.

37:55.736 --> 37:57.147
You're not going anywhere until you

37:57.149 --> 37:58.512
tell me where you've been.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.076
To Evan's okay, can I go now?

38:27.137 --> 38:27.970
Please.

38:28.061 --> 38:29.144
Come on, Dad.

38:30.910 --> 38:32.436
Pick up.

38:32.438 --> 38:34.521
Pick up, please, come on.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.102
You've reached Dan.

39:33.695 --> 39:36.278
Can't stop thinking about it.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.824
I can't stop thinking about it.

39:41.933 --> 39:42.766
Hmmm.

39:45.599 --> 39:46.432
Hello?

39:48.028 --> 39:49.262
Vince?

39:50.669 --> 39:51.662
Hello?

39:53.879 --> 39:54.712
Hi.

39:54.880 --> 39:55.713
Hey.

40:03.039 --> 40:03.992
You've been busy.

40:04.139 --> 40:06.489
So Lizzy's coming to
get her stuff this week.

40:06.719 --> 40:08.367
She's gonna kill me if the
place still looks like this.

40:08.369 --> 40:10.567
Can you, can you take those pictures

40:10.569 --> 40:12.147
down over there and put them in a box?

40:12.149 --> 40:13.149
Get started on that?

40:16.569 --> 40:17.402
Sure.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.211
Coming.

40:29.519 --> 40:30.352
Evan.

40:31.209 --> 40:32.802
Sarah's not home right now.

40:32.929 --> 40:34.087
Oh, uh, sorry.

40:34.089 --> 40:36.072
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?

40:36.269 --> 40:37.102
Come on in.

40:37.695 --> 40:38.528
Okay.

40:55.259 --> 40:58.802
So how long have
you and Sarah been an item?

41:00.255 --> 41:01.088
What?

41:01.469 --> 41:03.569
She told me you were very close.

41:06.269 --> 41:08.987
Yeah, she's been acting
kinda weird, to be honest.

41:08.989 --> 41:11.912
Oh, what do you mean?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.347
It's just that sometimes
I think she likes me,

41:14.349 --> 41:17.637
and then, I don't know, sometimes I don't.

41:17.639 --> 41:19.682
She's probably playing hard to get.

41:20.249 --> 41:21.857
She was in a great mood last night

41:21.859 --> 41:23.792
when she came home from your place.

41:25.647 --> 41:26.480
Uh, yeah.

41:28.449 --> 41:30.626
Thanks for the lemonade, but I gotta go.

41:31.309 --> 41:32.967
Come by, come back any time.

41:32.969 --> 41:35.022
- Yeah.
- Bye, Evan.

41:47.829 --> 41:49.532
Do you wanna get some food?

41:49.789 --> 41:51.589
You can order a pizza if you want.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.912
I was thinking maybe
we could drive somewhere.

41:57.529 --> 41:58.679
I gotta keep working.

42:00.969 --> 42:01.802
Okay.

42:03.189 --> 42:04.332
Then I'm gonna go.

42:05.037 --> 42:05.870
Okay.

42:10.249 --> 42:11.082
Bye.

42:11.217 --> 42:12.384
Bye.

42:29.597 --> 42:30.430
Ohhhhh.

42:43.171 --> 42:44.004
Hi.

42:44.769 --> 42:46.719
Jacob is on his way over to pick me up.

42:48.779 --> 42:51.842
Do you think you could
find someplace to go?

42:52.799 --> 42:54.422
Where am I supposed to go?

42:54.649 --> 42:56.232
Um, I don't know.

42:57.067 --> 42:58.567
What about Evan's?

43:00.100 --> 43:02.820
Thank you, honey, you're the best.

43:49.096 --> 43:49.932
You okay?

43:50.519 --> 43:51.352
Sorry.

43:53.149 --> 43:54.049
What's going on?

43:54.239 --> 43:55.072
Nothing.

43:58.820 --> 44:00.420
It's that older guy, isn't it?

44:01.389 --> 44:02.222
What?

44:02.749 --> 44:04.449
I was talking to your mom, and...

44:04.521 --> 44:06.307
What the fuck, why were
you talking to my mom?

44:06.309 --> 44:07.527
Because I went to see you,

44:07.529 --> 44:09.372
and you weren't there, as usual.

44:09.859 --> 44:11.267
And she said that you said you were at

44:11.269 --> 44:12.269
my house last night?

44:12.363 --> 44:14.842
Yeah, she was being a bitch,
and I didn't wanna go home.

44:15.969 --> 44:16.869
Do you like him?

44:17.249 --> 44:19.087
No, why would you even ask me that?

44:19.089 --> 44:20.177
Because you're always with him.

44:20.179 --> 44:22.792
Yeah, because we're just friends, okay?

44:23.409 --> 44:24.702
Look, don't go.

44:25.821 --> 44:27.592
I'm just worried about you.

44:28.009 --> 44:30.546
Don't worry about me,
and don't talk to my mom.

45:05.493 --> 45:06.326
Asshole.

45:14.684 --> 45:16.351
Mind if I come in?

45:16.505 --> 45:18.672
Yeah, of course.

45:38.699 --> 45:40.792
He totally blew me off.

45:41.569 --> 45:42.982
He didn't even call.

45:44.035 --> 45:45.085
Can you believe that?

45:46.579 --> 45:49.029
You deserve better, guy
sounds like an asshole.

45:50.009 --> 45:50.842
Thank you.

45:53.452 --> 45:55.232
What about you, Vincent?

45:56.129 --> 45:56.962
What about me?

45:57.919 --> 46:00.272
You must have girls
lined up around the block.

46:00.889 --> 46:02.772
I can assure you, there is no line.

46:03.946 --> 46:05.479
We're both adults here.

46:05.481 --> 46:07.536
I'm flattered, I am, but...

46:07.717 --> 46:08.548
Are you?

46:08.550 --> 46:09.542
Nancy? Are you listening?

46:14.319 --> 46:15.152
Coming.

46:19.359 --> 46:20.202
Sarah.

46:21.429 --> 46:22.262
Sarah?

46:23.769 --> 46:26.612
Mom? What are you doing here?

46:27.519 --> 46:28.902
Jacob stood me up.

46:28.959 --> 46:31.192
He's such a jerk.

46:31.789 --> 46:32.989
What are you doing here?

46:33.949 --> 46:36.099
You kicked me out of
the house, remember?

46:37.669 --> 46:39.942
What an imagination this one has.

46:40.239 --> 46:41.812
Come and sit with me.

46:42.869 --> 46:46.319
I am so glad that you and Vince are

46:46.856 --> 46:48.942
becoming such good friends.

46:49.319 --> 46:50.769
Why don't you have some wine?

46:51.669 --> 46:53.927
Vince, would you mind getting her a glass?

46:53.929 --> 46:54.762
Really?

46:56.736 --> 46:58.152
Uh, okay.

46:59.099 --> 47:02.112
Don't stay too long, I
think tonight's the night.

47:06.459 --> 47:09.792
Men just want younger women.

47:11.019 --> 47:14.507
It just doesn't matter how many crunches

47:14.509 --> 47:16.282
or down dogs you do.

47:19.573 --> 47:23.137
That's why I'm so glad you
finally have a boyfriend, honey.

47:23.139 --> 47:24.787
I don't have a boyfriend, Mom.

47:24.789 --> 47:25.937
Really, what about Evan?

47:25.939 --> 47:27.722
Evan's not my boyfriend.

47:28.989 --> 47:29.822
Well listen,

47:30.919 --> 47:33.142
you can only play hard to get for so long.

47:33.149 --> 47:34.509
Seriously, because

47:35.750 --> 47:37.652
you have to finally just grab one,

47:38.189 --> 47:40.149
hold on tight, because

47:42.409 --> 47:44.859
if you don't, you just go
through other people's,

47:45.689 --> 47:47.397
you know, leftovers, right?

47:47.399 --> 47:49.082
I'm talking to you too, Vincent.

47:49.369 --> 47:50.827
Let's go home, okay?

47:50.829 --> 47:52.902
I'm conversating with Vincent.

48:02.533 --> 48:04.737
I don't like
Evan, he's not my boyfriend.

48:04.739 --> 48:05.660
It's fine, it's fine,

48:05.662 --> 48:07.190
and you're talking too loudly.

48:07.192 --> 48:10.832
I mean, I only said that
to cover for the other night.

48:10.971 --> 48:11.804
Whisper.

48:11.959 --> 48:13.186
I don't like him.

48:14.169 --> 48:15.086
I like you.

48:18.789 --> 48:21.862
Sarah, I like you too, but it's just...

48:21.943 --> 48:24.032
It's fine, God, she's out cold.

48:25.709 --> 48:27.707
Sarah, Sarah, please, come here.

48:27.709 --> 48:28.542
Stop.

48:29.218 --> 48:31.945
Sarah, please don't.

48:33.599 --> 48:36.766
It's not funny, it's not funny, Sarah.

48:38.268 --> 48:39.706
Will you come back down here please?

48:39.708 --> 48:42.717
Sarah, come on, Sarah.

48:42.719 --> 48:44.222
Sarah, Sarah.

48:44.859 --> 48:45.692
I'm serious.

48:46.749 --> 48:48.022
Sarah, get outta the bed.

48:48.676 --> 48:51.189
This is not, this is not funny.

48:58.417 --> 48:59.584
Oh, my head.

49:06.679 --> 49:08.002
Oh God.

49:09.189 --> 49:10.022
Oh God.

49:23.633 --> 49:26.792
Hello?

49:28.048 --> 49:29.198
Hello, is anybody here?

49:31.286 --> 49:32.119
Oh, God.

49:37.515 --> 49:39.182
Sarah, stop, stop.

49:39.452 --> 49:41.017
She can't hear us.

49:50.390 --> 49:51.223
Hello?

49:54.789 --> 49:58.092
Ohhh, oh my God.

50:01.234 --> 50:04.395
You're talking too loud,
what's wrong with you?

50:04.397 --> 50:07.589
It's not fucking funny, it's not a joke.

50:19.316 --> 50:20.147
That was hot.

50:20.149 --> 50:21.202
Let's do it again.

50:21.791 --> 50:23.624
You have to go home.

50:24.908 --> 50:28.377
You have to go, Sarah,
you have to go home.

50:32.079 --> 50:32.912
Hey.

50:35.639 --> 50:37.992
Here, take these.

50:38.190 --> 50:39.562
Thank you.

50:39.564 --> 50:41.302
They'll make
you feel a lot better.

50:42.479 --> 50:44.229
Thank you, sweetie.

51:04.362 --> 51:07.852
What am I gonna do when
you go off to college?

51:08.919 --> 51:10.440
I haven't even applied yet, Mom.

51:10.442 --> 51:12.222
When you move to Silver Lake.

51:13.249 --> 51:15.049
I'm not gonna move to Silver Lake.

51:15.929 --> 51:17.952
You're gonna do a lot of fun things.

51:19.579 --> 51:21.179
And I'm gonna be here all alone.

51:22.446 --> 51:24.096
Mom, you're not gonna be alone.

51:29.419 --> 51:32.219
I'm really sorry about the
way things have turned out.

51:34.561 --> 51:36.111
Sometimes I think I could have,

51:36.889 --> 51:39.322
we could have tried a little harder.

51:40.175 --> 51:41.957
Mom, you guys fought all the time.

51:41.959 --> 51:42.809
I know.

51:43.019 --> 51:44.347
It's better with him gone.

51:44.349 --> 51:46.322
Yeah, I guess.

51:49.109 --> 51:50.282
We're doing okay, huh?

51:59.439 --> 52:01.942
Hope I didn't embarrass
you too much last night.

52:06.709 --> 52:07.542
It's okay.

52:11.299 --> 52:12.132
Hey.

52:12.169 --> 52:14.052
Hi, how's she doing?

52:15.029 --> 52:17.152
She keeps telling me she has a migraine,

52:17.379 --> 52:19.362
as if I don't know what a hangover is.

52:20.639 --> 52:22.997
She wants to live in a
world where you never grow up.

52:22.999 --> 52:24.242
But I am grown up.

52:30.269 --> 52:32.392
I thought you weren't
coming until tomorrow.

52:33.025 --> 52:35.522
Got tired of play dates, so
I thought I'd just stop by.

52:36.649 --> 52:39.192
I hope I'm not interrupting something.

52:39.679 --> 52:40.932
No, no, of course not.

52:42.439 --> 52:46.062
This is Sarah, she's been
helping clean out the house.

52:47.579 --> 52:50.922
Hi, I'm Elizabeth, I'm his sister.

52:51.379 --> 52:53.852
Sarah is Nancy's daughter.

52:54.579 --> 52:56.279
Nancy, next-door-neighbor Nancy?

52:57.959 --> 53:00.337
Yeah, yeah, she's been a huge help

53:00.339 --> 53:01.439
packing everything up.

53:03.949 --> 53:04.912
I brought lunch.

53:05.609 --> 53:06.559
You should join us.

53:06.949 --> 53:08.352
No, it's okay.

53:11.609 --> 53:12.452
Yeah, yeah.

53:13.189 --> 53:14.762
Of course, stay.

53:29.329 --> 53:31.279
I can't believe Mom held on to these.

53:32.029 --> 53:33.982
She pretty much held on to everything.

53:34.049 --> 53:34.882
I would know.

53:36.539 --> 53:37.992
What's that supposed to mean?

53:40.219 --> 53:41.052
Nothing.

53:43.749 --> 53:46.032
So, Sarah, you got to Findlay?

53:46.189 --> 53:47.022
Yeah.

53:47.389 --> 53:49.282
And you're a junior?

53:49.679 --> 53:51.679
I'm going into my junior high.

53:52.049 --> 53:54.222
So that makes you how old?

53:55.239 --> 53:56.072
16.

53:57.139 --> 53:57.972
16?

54:09.699 --> 54:10.532
Thanks again.

54:11.559 --> 54:12.509
See you tomorrow.

54:18.559 --> 54:19.392
Hey.

54:19.419 --> 54:20.822
What are you doing here?

54:20.869 --> 54:22.487
We're just having some lunch.

54:22.489 --> 54:23.452
What's with you?

54:23.699 --> 54:25.849
Okay, well, I'll just
leave you two then.

54:25.899 --> 54:28.187
Come, stop, join us.

54:28.189 --> 54:29.287
I'm not hungry.

54:29.289 --> 54:31.647
I told you not to talk to my mom.

54:31.649 --> 54:33.132
Well I came to see you.

54:33.689 --> 54:34.862
Stop!

54:36.127 --> 54:38.392
You sure stare at him a
lot for a guy you don't like.

54:38.658 --> 54:39.852
You're just jealous.

54:40.779 --> 54:42.747
What is with you, are
you like in love with him?

54:42.749 --> 54:44.142
Yeah, maybe I am.

54:46.269 --> 54:47.102
Wow.

54:47.749 --> 54:48.987
Yeah, it's even worse than I thought.

54:48.989 --> 54:50.127
I didn't mean it.

54:50.129 --> 54:51.862
He hates me anyway.

54:51.949 --> 54:53.199
Yeah, whatever you say.

54:53.909 --> 54:55.917
What are you even doing here anyway?

54:55.919 --> 54:58.992
Can't you take a hint
that I don't like you?

55:02.563 --> 55:04.763
You know, you've
turned into a real bitch.

55:10.989 --> 55:12.389
Are you sleeping with her?

55:12.429 --> 55:14.732
Jesus Christ, of course I'm not.

55:19.289 --> 55:22.966
Things might have gone two far once or...

55:23.289 --> 55:25.127
Have you completely lost your mind?

55:25.129 --> 55:26.362
It's been tough here,

55:26.989 --> 55:28.894
alone, surrounded by all this shit, okay?

55:28.896 --> 55:29.834
Here we go again.

55:29.836 --> 55:31.378
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Lizzie?

55:31.380 --> 55:33.964
There's always some girl who
adores you, and you love it,

55:33.966 --> 55:36.297
and then eventually they
find out that you're only

55:36.299 --> 55:38.397
with them because you're
terrified of being alone.

55:38.399 --> 55:40.199
It's time you figured your shit out.

55:40.329 --> 55:42.592
I'm sorry, you're one to talk.

55:42.779 --> 55:44.677
Because I've been here
taking care of all this shit

55:44.679 --> 55:46.282
on my own, actually.

55:46.359 --> 55:47.867
I did the funeral.

55:47.869 --> 55:48.917
And I offered to help!

55:48.919 --> 55:51.117
Well, yes, but I had to do it quickly

55:51.119 --> 55:53.819
and I couldn't just wait and
see if you would show up!

56:00.079 --> 56:01.519
I fucked up, I know.

56:04.649 --> 56:05.549
You just need to

56:06.589 --> 56:07.506
talk to...

56:08.149 --> 56:08.982
Sarah.

56:10.029 --> 56:12.809
And tell Sarah that you made a mistake

56:12.839 --> 56:14.802
and that you're sorry.

56:17.689 --> 56:19.839
You're leaving in a
few days anyway, right?

56:24.239 --> 56:25.794
Vince, are you listening to me?

56:25.796 --> 56:27.992
Yes, I heard you, I'm listening.

56:30.040 --> 56:30.873
It has to end.

56:31.699 --> 56:32.532
I know.

56:51.602 --> 56:52.769
Can we talk?

56:52.943 --> 56:53.972
Yes, definitely.

56:54.149 --> 56:56.307
I don't know what's going
on, but you were acting

56:56.309 --> 56:57.917
really weird last night, and then you just

56:57.919 --> 56:59.632
slammed the door in my face.

56:59.692 --> 57:01.109
I know, I know.

57:01.684 --> 57:02.851
And I'm sorry.

57:04.659 --> 57:05.812
I forgive you.

57:08.419 --> 57:10.322
Can we just hang out today?

57:19.420 --> 57:20.420
It's Evan.

57:20.739 --> 57:23.562
Evan, I thought you were upstairs?

57:24.429 --> 57:25.629
I need to talk to you.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.071
Oh my gosh.

57:28.073 --> 57:30.129
Okay, Sarah, just
listen to me one second.

57:30.169 --> 57:31.657
I don't know how to say this, but...

57:31.659 --> 57:32.759
Let's talk tomorrow.

57:37.252 --> 57:39.552
Just one kiss, and then we'll talk.

57:57.039 --> 57:59.039
Fuck, oh my God, fuck.

57:59.589 --> 58:00.422
We,

58:01.699 --> 58:03.712
we, we can't do this anymore.

58:04.789 --> 58:06.192
No one's gonna find out.

58:06.419 --> 58:07.252
That's not it.

58:08.609 --> 58:10.589
I know that you're leaving, but

58:10.979 --> 58:13.757
I can come visit you or you can come back.

58:13.759 --> 58:15.002
No, no, this,

58:15.056 --> 58:17.552
Sarah, this should have
never happened, okay?

58:19.191 --> 58:20.352
You don't mean that.

58:20.489 --> 58:22.017
I do, I do.

58:22.019 --> 58:23.992
Of course I do, I'm 36 years old.

58:24.159 --> 58:25.202
And you're 16.

58:25.402 --> 58:26.233
So?

58:26.235 --> 58:27.066
So?

58:27.068 --> 58:28.667
This is your time to
make mistakes, not mine.

58:28.669 --> 58:30.517
It's my time to get my shit together.

58:30.519 --> 58:32.507
Doesn't feel like a mistake to me.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.347
Sarah, this doesn't make any sense.

58:34.349 --> 58:35.999
This can't ever be anything more.

58:41.070 --> 58:41.903
Oh.

58:43.976 --> 58:46.337
I'm,

58:46.339 --> 58:47.702
I'm sorry, I am.

58:49.739 --> 58:51.089
I never wanted to hurt you.

58:54.279 --> 58:55.112
Hey, hey.

58:56.939 --> 58:59.612
You're an amazing girl, you are.

59:00.636 --> 59:02.336
And you have so much ahead of you.

59:05.901 --> 59:07.412
But I can't be a part of it.

59:09.646 --> 59:10.479
I'm sorry.

59:12.439 --> 59:14.292
Sarah, I'm sorry.

59:16.822 --> 59:17.655
Fuck.

59:26.899 --> 59:28.512
Hold it, right there.

59:29.689 --> 59:32.002
Stop, we need to talk!

59:32.809 --> 59:34.206
We need to talk!

59:35.384 --> 59:36.217
Stop!

59:44.092 --> 59:45.842
Sarah, open the door.

59:50.934 --> 59:53.267
Sarah, open the door please.

01:01:30.496 --> 01:01:31.732
How could you?

01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:33.267
I trusted you.

01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:34.367
I tried to stop it.

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:36.502
Oh come on, she's a child.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.718
I never meant for this to happen.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.111
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:01:44.113 --> 01:01:44.944
Believe me, I am.

01:01:44.946 --> 01:01:45.777
Stop!

01:01:45.779 --> 01:01:46.697
Honey, be quiet, shh.

01:01:46.699 --> 01:01:47.592
Be quiet.

01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.860
Sarah...

01:01:48.862 --> 01:01:49.852
Don't say her name!

01:01:49.869 --> 01:01:52.172
Mom, can I talk to Vince alone?

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:53.335
No that is not gonna happen.

01:01:53.337 --> 01:01:54.168
Please?

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.001
It's not gonna happen.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:55.834
- No, honey, no.
- Please?

01:01:55.836 --> 01:01:57.789
- Go inside now.
- Mom!

01:02:03.609 --> 01:02:05.812
Your mother would be horrified.

01:02:25.229 --> 01:02:26.602
Leave me alone.

01:02:26.749 --> 01:02:30.255
Sarah, honey,
you need to open the door.

01:02:30.257 --> 01:02:32.217
Just leave me alone, please.

01:02:32.219 --> 01:02:33.719
Sarah, please open the door.

01:02:40.783 --> 01:02:41.616
Awww.

01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:50.602
I'm so sorry.

01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:58.452
I know it hurts like hell right now.

01:02:59.657 --> 01:03:01.782
But this will pass.

01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:04.052
How can you say that?

01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:05.347
Mom, I love him.

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:07.177
I know, I know, I know you love him.

01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:09.229
It wouldn't hurt this much if you didn't.

01:03:12.423 --> 01:03:13.623
But you'll get over him.

01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:17.456
No, I'm not as strong as you.

01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:20.812
What are you talking about?

01:03:20.962 --> 01:03:23.022
I can't just bounce back like you do.

01:03:24.439 --> 01:03:26.107
Oh, oh, okay.

01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:28.522
Well, that takes years of training.

01:03:30.939 --> 01:03:32.902
You get better at it as you get older.

01:03:35.129 --> 01:03:36.819
But it does still hurt,

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:38.952
every time.

01:03:40.099 --> 01:03:41.372
I never see it.

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:44.682
Well, I don't want you to see it.

01:03:45.259 --> 01:03:47.162
I don't want you worrying about me.

01:03:50.055 --> 01:03:50.892
I'm sorry.

01:03:52.732 --> 01:03:55.149
You don't need to be sorry.

01:03:57.142 --> 01:03:59.210
You're gonna be all right.

01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:03.801
You're gonna be just fine.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.827
Jesus Christ.

01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:48.996
Sarah, what are you doing?

01:04:49.992 --> 01:04:51.409
You're leaving?

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:55.989
I know this doesn't make
any sense to you right now.

01:04:56.239 --> 01:04:58.922
I do, but that's how it has to be.

01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:02.312
I didn't tell her, I swear.

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:07.362
Sarah, you didn't do anything
wrong, this is my fault.

01:05:25.194 --> 01:05:26.027
Sarah?

01:05:27.231 --> 01:05:28.148
Look at me.

01:05:30.256 --> 01:05:32.256
Stick with the painting.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.044
I mean it, okay?

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:36.083
I will.

01:05:38.539 --> 01:05:40.223
And give your mom a break.

01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:42.308
She really does love you.

01:05:43.046 --> 01:05:43.963
I'll try.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:54.557
I should go.

01:06:18.028 --> 01:06:18.945
Bye, Sarah.

01:08:16.437 --> 01:08:17.937
Gosh, I'm sorry.

01:08:18.312 --> 01:08:19.792
You really need to get
your hearing checked.

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.511
Is that me?

01:08:28.157 --> 01:08:28.990
Yeah.

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:35.260
How wonderful.

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:39.915
Could you make me look a
little more attractive?

01:08:41.398 --> 01:08:42.898
That's my style.

01:08:44.104 --> 01:08:45.437
You know what?

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:48.604
Oh gosh, I just love it.

01:08:50.385 --> 01:08:51.218
Love it.

01:08:58.893 --> 01:08:59.810
Keep it up.
