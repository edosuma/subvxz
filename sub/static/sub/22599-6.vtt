BOTH:
Ugh!

19:33.715 --> 19:36.760
Why haven't you destroyed them?
Traitors.

19:37.386 --> 19:40.430
Ingrates. Freaks, all of you.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.563
We're not freaks, Slug.
We're Outsiders.

19:52.401 --> 19:53.360
Ah!

19:59.825 --> 20:01.618
WILDCAT:
Wait for-- Ah!

20:02.411 --> 20:03.745
Oh, no.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.830
[HEART POUNDING]

20:05.455 --> 20:07.416
Not now. Ugh...

20:09.668 --> 20:11.503
[ROARING]

20:34.735 --> 20:36.361
Ah!

20:44.745 --> 20:46.788
Good riddance.

20:47.748 --> 20:48.874
BATMAN:
Wildcat?

20:49.499 --> 20:51.376
Wildcat.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.714
Batman, what is it?

20:56.465 --> 20:58.550
It's his heart. Be calm.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.595
Okay, listen to me carefully.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.682
You know I hate to repeat myself.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.728
Metamorpho, his lungs need oxygen.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.904
Black Lightning, let's see
if we can't give this jalopy a jumpstart.

21:18.904 --> 21:20.572
Everyone clear.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.827
Again. Clear.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.667
Come on. Wake up, dude.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.629
[COUGHING]

21:36.546 --> 21:38.674
Don't worry, son.

21:39.549 --> 21:42.844
Still got about four lives left.

21:42.844 --> 21:46.807
And who are you calling a jalopy?

21:52.729 --> 21:54.898
That's it, kid. Stick the jab.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.651
Chin down. Good man.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.615
Ha, ha. This is the best milk shake ever.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.617
Yo, Katana, have you tried this?

22:05.617 --> 22:08.662
It's got fish and bananas in it.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.919
BATMAN:
With Wildcat's help, who knows?

22:15.919 --> 22:19.798
Maybe these Outsiders have the makings
of something bigger.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.717
WILDCAT:
Come on. Let me have it.

22:21.717 --> 22:22.843
[THWACK]

22:22.843 --> 22:25.887
Ugh! Good swing, son.
