00:00.001 --> 00:03.702
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All right, let's dive in.</i>
<i>As you know, jane was</i>

00:03.704 --> 00:05.437
<i>Accidentally inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sperm.</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:08.507
But I've never had sex.
<i>This created some ups</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.376
<i>And some downs.</i>
<i>On the bright side...</i>

00:10.378 --> 00:11.744
I'm here.
<i>...Jane felt herself falling</i>

00:11.746 --> 00:14.079
<i>For her baby daddy.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

00:14.081 --> 00:16.548
<i>On the downside...</i>
<i>I mean, we're so different.</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:18.384
We're having a baby.
Let's focus on that.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.719
<i>But rafael wouldn't</i>
<i>take no for an answer.</i>

00:20.721 --> 00:24.089
And I'm gonna fight for you too.
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>rafael's soon-to-be</i>

00:24.091 --> 00:27.459
<i>Ex-wife wasn't going down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>
<i>We're done, petra.</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:30.429
Jane's got to change
her mind. You guys have to
share custody of that baby.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.197
<i>But petra had bigger problems.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.199
<i>See, she was being</i>
<i>blackmailed by ivan,</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:36.435
<i>The man who knew</i>
<i>her secret identity.</i>
<i>Natalia.</i>

00:36.437 --> 00:38.504
<i>And she had accidentally</i>
<i>taken him hostage.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.806
(grunts)
stop it!

00:40.808 --> 00:42.775
<i>Oh, and jane's</i>
<i>ex-fiancÃ©e michael--</i>

00:42.777 --> 00:45.344
<i>He was on the hunt</i>
<i>for the notorious drug dealer</i>

00:45.346 --> 00:46.612
<i>Sin rostro.</i>
<i>I don't like this.</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:49.448
<i>And he was getting closer.</i>
<i>He's gone.</i>

00:49.450 --> 00:51.316
<i>And now, let's start.</i>
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:55.587
<i>They say you never</i>
<i>forget your first...</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:57.589
<i>Short story.</i>

00:57.591 --> 01:00.592
<i>Certainly, young</i>
<i>jane gloriana villanueva</i>

01:00.594 --> 01:04.163
<i>Remembered everything about</i>
<i>the night she wrote hers.</i>

01:04.165 --> 01:06.632
<i>It was as though</i>
<i>something opened inside her.</i>

01:06.634 --> 01:08.700
<i>Suddenly, her world</i>
<i>became magical.</i>

01:08.702 --> 01:10.636
Printer: Keep going.
You're good at this.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.705
Teddy bear: You're awesome,
jane. You're doing great.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.076
Virgin mary: I think
you've found your calling.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.578
Teddy bear: Your mommy's
gonna be so proud of you.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.481
Printer:
Keep going.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.588
Printer:
Show your mom.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.827
Xiomara:
No. Mommy,

01:34.829 --> 01:36.562
This is what I'm good at.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.729
It's my dream.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.541
Xiomara:
It's okay. Don't cry, ma.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.677
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Like I said, jane never forgot</i>

01:51.679 --> 01:55.414
<i>The night she wrote</i>
<i>her first short story.</i>

01:55.416 --> 01:57.249
<i>It was the same night</i>
<i>she learned</i>

01:57.251 --> 01:58.884
<i>Dreams weren't practical.</i>

01:58.886 --> 02:01.587
And so jane kept hers a secret.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.323
But she never stopped dreaming.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.460
<i>See, for years,</i>
<i>jane had been submitting</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:10.262
<i>Stories to online magazines.</i>

02:10.264 --> 02:12.164
<i>And she had the archived</i>
<i>rejection letters to prove it.</i>

02:12.166 --> 02:13.632
(computer dings)

02:13.634 --> 02:15.734
<i>So she assumed she had</i>
<i>just received another one.</i>

02:15.736 --> 02:17.736
<i>But at this</i>
<i>particular moment,</i>

02:17.738 --> 02:21.206
<i>She was wrong,</i>
<i>and thrilled to be so.</i>

02:25.745 --> 02:27.779
Hallelujah!

02:27.781 --> 02:29.748
I told you
you were good at this.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.325
Morning, everyone.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.827
Is it the
pregnancy hormones

02:41.829 --> 02:44.363
Or did something really
good just happen?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.165
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Something really, really</i>
<i>good just happened.</i>

02:46.167 --> 02:48.467
Just excited
about your big meeting

02:48.469 --> 02:50.235
With your record label guy.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.739
I'm not nervous.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.741
He heard my demo
and he liked it,

02:55.743 --> 02:58.343
And so we're meeting.
It's not a big deal.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.212
Just because this is
my lifelong dream

03:00.214 --> 03:02.581
Doesn't mean I'm so
suddenly freaking nervous.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.883
(laughs)
and then excited,
and then back to nervous.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.586
Jane: You'll be great, mom.
You're absolutely sure

03:07.588 --> 03:09.888
You don't need me today
at your sonogram?
I'm sure.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.757
And you can take the car.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.426
I'm going with rafael,
and we're taking the bus.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.727
It's his first time.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.229
Aw.
Cute, right?

03:17.231 --> 03:19.431
<i>Muy</i> cute.
So, so cute.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.333
Uh, so-so where do I...

03:21.335 --> 03:22.634
You just slide it.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.969
Like a credit card.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.772
Oh. Got it,
like a credit card.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.240
Great.

03:29.976 --> 03:33.812
So we can just sit anywhere?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.447
It's nice. Hey,
no, no, no, no.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.716
No, webmd. No...
Oh.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.786
You're right.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.521
But can't I just
look up the nuchal fold

03:42.523 --> 03:44.256
So that I know
what they're looking for?

03:44.258 --> 03:46.825
No, no. It's a wormhole.
It's gonna make you nervous.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.694
We talked about this.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.295
Huh?

03:50.297 --> 03:52.631
You're right.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.766
So, just to be clear,

03:54.768 --> 03:57.002
I know we had a rough
official first date,

03:57.004 --> 04:00.272
But we are
back on, right?

04:00.274 --> 04:02.541
Back on? What are you,
like, 14 years old?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.610
Will you just indulge my
14-year-old self, please?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.578
(giggles)
are we?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
We're taking it slow.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.349
As long as we're
taking it somewhere.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.451
(laughs)

04:12.453 --> 04:14.720
And as long...

04:14.722 --> 04:16.255
As I can kiss you.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.623
What... No.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.992
Less kissing, more talking.

04:19.994 --> 04:22.728
We got to start to get
to know each other, right?

04:22.730 --> 04:25.864
Right. Okay. Tell me something
about you that I don't know.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.800
Well, I've been
submitting short stories

04:28.802 --> 04:30.602
To online magazines for years.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.804
And this morning, I found out
from the <i>cincinnati review</i>

04:32.806 --> 04:34.406
That they want to publish one.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.708
What? Th-that's great.
So when does it go up?

04:36.710 --> 04:39.378
Oh, I'm not gonna let them
publish it, actually.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.780
Why?
The main character
in the story, lucy,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.882
Is a feisty, single mom
that wears booty shorts

04:43.884 --> 04:45.784
And entertains
a revolving door of guys.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.786
â™ª

04:47.788 --> 04:50.656
Ah. Well, I'm
sure your mom's

04:50.658 --> 04:52.491
Got a sense of humor
about herself, right?

04:52.493 --> 04:55.761
There's a line in it that says
she puts the "loose" in lucy.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.030
I-I... I mean...

04:58.032 --> 05:02.934
I took some creative license,
but it is based on her, and...

05:02.936 --> 05:04.803
I shouldn't have sent it in.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.773
It was just my favorite story,
and I wanted to see what it...

05:07.775 --> 05:11.677
Anyway... It's an honor just
to get the recognized, right?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.845
The recognition is nothing.
Only the award matters.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.847
To win my second
consecutive paloma--

05:15.849 --> 05:17.382
It would be unheard of.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.351
I'm gonna live-tweet
the show.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.787
Hashtag: Goro.
Hashtag: Rogeliomybrogelio.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.323
Hashtag: Vivadelavega.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.059
Excuse me.
Rogelio.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.660
Hello.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.896
Esteban. Hello to yourself.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.597
I was just seeing
where I sit...

05:32.599 --> 05:34.800
For when I win.

05:34.802 --> 05:38.770
How funny. I was just seeing
where I sit for when I win.
Well, we can't both win.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.605
No, we can't. Unless we tie.
Which we won't.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.541
I suppose we'll see
who wins then.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.743
Let the biggest star shine.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.913
He's so cocky.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.349
Okay, let's practice
my acceptance speech.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.917
I would like to thank

05:51.919 --> 05:54.853
God, for giving me
all this talent.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.356
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And while rogelio was</i>
<i>thanking his god,</i>

05:57.358 --> 05:59.458
<i>Xiomara was praying to hers.</i>

05:59.460 --> 06:02.127
Please, please, please
let today's meeting go well.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.863
The one and only paulina rubio.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.966
My entire life I've been
hoping for a chance like this.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.768
Today is the day, xo.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.936
You're gonna step into

06:10.938 --> 06:13.105
Your destiny.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.707
In different shoes, of course.

06:17.443 --> 06:20.445
You're sexy,
you're not a stripper.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.684
And pump up the lipstick

06:25.686 --> 06:28.653
A shade. Perfect.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.856
Yes. Go, go, go.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.124
We're screwed.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.626
We are, we're screwed.
We are not screwed.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.829
We lost a serbian
war criminal.
No one even knows he was here.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.464
Yeah, because we didn't
report our lead. But this--

06:39.466 --> 06:41.099
This is crazy.
What is the connection

06:41.101 --> 06:43.034
Between sin rostro
and the serbian?
I don't know.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.803
And where the hell
is the serbian?
I don't know.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.104
Exactly. Which is why
we have to report it.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.739
We don't have to report it,
we have to solve it.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.574
Listen, I have a theory, okay?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.410
Sin rostro went
underground, right?
Mm-hmm.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.812
Around the same time
rafael got cancer.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.547
What?
As soon as rafael's better

06:55.549 --> 06:56.982
And takes over the hotel...

06:56.984 --> 07:00.519
Sin rostro resurfaces
and there are two murders.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.122
That's your theory?
That rafael is sin rostro?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.824
It can't all be a coincidence.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.492
Where's your evidence?

07:07.494 --> 07:09.428
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Well, that was a problem.</i>

07:09.430 --> 07:11.463
<i>As he had none. Yet.</i>

07:11.465 --> 07:13.064
I like you, michael.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.900
But I am not
risking my badge

07:14.902 --> 07:16.768
So you can indulge in
your rafael vendetta.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.905
You got to
let go of jane.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.740
This is not about jane.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.842
Less than 2.5 millimeters.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.645
We want the nuchal fold
to be less than 2.5 millimeters.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.116
I'm confused.
When did you go on webmd?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.918
In the bathroom.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.986
It just needs to be under 2.5.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.089
If it's over, that can signal
genetic abnormality.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.594
Can you just maybe
give me a ballpark?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.929
I'm not allowed to say anything.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.997
Only a doctor can give results.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.133
Right. I'm sorry.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.935
You said that several times.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.169
It's gonna be okay.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.540
(mouthing)

07:57.877 --> 07:59.244
Do you believe in god?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.513
What?

08:01.515 --> 08:03.582
I was just praying,
and I wondered.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.019
Uh...

08:08.021 --> 08:11.723
I-I... I don't know.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.992
I-I've just never been one
for organized religion.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.094
But you were raised

08:16.096 --> 08:18.129
Catholic though, right?

08:18.131 --> 08:21.066
Yes.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.701
Sorry, it...

08:22.703 --> 08:24.736
Just seems like
the kind of thing you talk about

08:24.738 --> 08:26.037
<i>Before</i> a sonogram.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.174
I was accidentally
artificially inseminated.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.776
I'll get the doctor.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.245
Mm.
Thank you.

08:33.247 --> 08:35.046
I just...

08:35.048 --> 08:38.750
Well, I imagined that...

08:38.752 --> 08:42.053
My kids would be baptized

08:42.055 --> 08:44.656
And go to Sunday school.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.092
Sunday school?
Kids hate Sunday school.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.261
Doesn't mean
they shouldn't go.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.630
Okay, compromise.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.965
Prep school with a
religious component.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.101
Private school?
Are you serious?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.736
Are you kidding?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.104
Have you seen the state
of public education today?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.772
It's horrible.
Yeah, sure, there are problems.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.308
But there are great upsides,
like more diversity.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.144
Means less of a chance
of being an entitled snob.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.214
Percentage-wise. Not you.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.719
Okay. Everything looks great.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.821
The fetus is around
three inches long

09:16.823 --> 09:19.024
Right now--
about the size of a peach.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.661
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in that moment, all</i>
<i>their differences faded away,</i>

09:22.663 --> 09:25.864
<i>And jane and rafael were</i>
<i>perfectly and completely happy.</i>

09:25.866 --> 09:28.166
I'm so sorry I'm late.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.569
<i>Come on. Did you think</i>
<i>it would last?</i>

09:30.571 --> 09:32.170
What the hell are
you doing here?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.573
What do you mean?
This is my baby, too.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.574
What?
Oh, no, no.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.908
Excuse me, what's going on?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.310
I'm sorry, my
ex-wife is crazy.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.779
You have zero claim
on this baby.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.181
You sure about that?
Do you remember

09:43.183 --> 09:45.584
After the, uh...
The miscarriage,

09:45.586 --> 09:47.619
When you and I were talking
about maybe using a surrogate?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.154
We drew up a pre-planned
adoption contract,

09:49.156 --> 09:52.190
Which stipulated that you and I
would be the legal parents

09:52.192 --> 09:53.224
Of the surrogate's child.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.161
And jane

09:56.163 --> 09:58.063
Is now serving as a surrogate.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.230
I am not a surrogate.
She's not a surrogate.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.166
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want this baby?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.234
Because there's a pretty clear
record of the fact

10:03.236 --> 10:06.771
That you didn't, starting with
your lawsuit against his sister.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.373
Which I withdrew.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.109
Ah. Not from the public records.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.777
Hey, hey.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.713
So I'm pretty sure this contract
will hold up in court.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.081
Especially since we haven't

10:16.083 --> 10:18.049
Reached a divorce
settlement yet.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.085
Why are you doing this?
For the money?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.654
I'm... Are you suggesting
that I'm not genuinely invested

10:22.656 --> 10:24.222
In the well-being of this baby?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.757
Because that's offensive.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.661
No, I want to be a part
of this child's life.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.731
And I'm willing to fight
for that right.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.271
Jane, are you okay?
Yeah.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.206
Just trying not to stress.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.307
It's important not to stress.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.675
At least, according to webmd.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.976
I e-mailed
my dad's lawyers.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.812
What if she does have a claim
on our kid?

10:47.814 --> 10:48.813
She doesn't.
Believe me,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.148
All petra wants is money.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.083
I'll pay her off if I have to.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.752
Is that really the way to go?
To just give her money?

10:53.754 --> 10:54.753
In this case, yes.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.321
But she doesn't deserve it.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.156
But that might be the only way
to shut this down.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.191
(sighs)

11:04.730 --> 11:07.298
You're probably wondering
why I'm here.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.200
As you may have heard
through social media,

11:09.202 --> 11:11.936
I've been nominated for
my second consecutive paloma.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.672
Congratulations.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.874
Thanks. It's an honor
just to get the recognition.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.242
And I would love to have

11:17.244 --> 11:18.343
All three villanueva women
with me

11:18.345 --> 11:20.745
At the awards ceremony.
(alba yelps)

11:20.747 --> 11:21.780
(laughs)

11:21.782 --> 11:23.415
I'd say that's a yes.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.188
The man is a fraud.
He cannot make a proper

11:30.190 --> 11:32.123
"I'm longing for you
but cannot have you" face.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.425
Watch this.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.293
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should point out</i>

11:35.295 --> 11:37.362
<i>That right at this moment</i>
<i>rogelio is not acting.</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:40.398
<i>He is, in fact,</i>
<i>longing for xiomara.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:44.069
But, alas, these two had agreed
<i>not to date,</i>

11:44.071 --> 11:47.372
<i>So as to not complicate jane's</i>
<i>relationship with her father.</i>

11:47.374 --> 11:49.874
I have to run.
Meeting with a record producer.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.776
Wish me luck.
Come.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.045
A hug from rogelio
is like a rabbit's foot.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.182
Lucky, rare,
and soft to the touch.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.889
(clears throat)

12:05.725 --> 12:06.891
Bye.
Bye.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.426
(chuckles)

12:12.465 --> 12:14.966
Walk tall, xo.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.167
Class.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.368
Confidence.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.737
And shake

12:18.739 --> 12:21.206
That ass just a tiny bit.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.742
The producers
are gonna love you.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.879
(man screams on tv)
petra: What's wrong?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.515
Those stupid pirates, they have
santos tied up in dungeon.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.518
No, I mean... What's wrong
with the way I look?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.220
I need to be downstairs, and...

12:35.222 --> 12:36.888
Something's not right.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.324
More red around your eyes.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.525
Like you've been crying.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.461
Put your hair up.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.898
Makes you look more serious.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.905
Petra:
Okay. Better.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.273
Come on, mother.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.975
I need you
for the sympathy vote.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.517
(gasps)

13:15.294 --> 13:17.162
Seriously, baby? This is
how you thank me for the job,

13:17.164 --> 13:18.496
A gambling ring?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.265
If we have to work
this telenovela after party,

13:20.267 --> 13:21.466
Might as well make it fun.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.334
Best actor, jane's
dad or esteban?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.470
Oh, esteban. He's everything.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.839
And your brother is here.

13:27.841 --> 13:31.176
Well, here we go.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.179
Seriously?
It's like an oscar pool.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.113
You gonna arrest me?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.515
I'm not gonna arrest you.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.518
I need your help.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.353
Look, if you think
rafael solano's a drug dealer,

13:42.355 --> 13:45.123
Arrest him.
That's the thing.
I need some proof.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.525
I got to be sure
before I bring him in.

13:47.527 --> 13:51.362
You know, 'cause he's jane's...

13:51.364 --> 13:53.198
(sighs)

13:53.200 --> 13:54.599
The father of jane's baby.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.067
So you're going rogue.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.303
Dig around.
See what you can find out.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.072
200 bucks.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.440
$350.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.254
It was awful.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.622
I walked in,

14:17.624 --> 14:20.458
And I could literally see
his face fall.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.962
He said he thought from my song
I'd be younger.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.335
(sighs)

14:32.238 --> 14:35.373
I don't know. Maybe it's a sign.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.277
Maybe I should focus on my dance
school, try to really grow it.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.545
There's got to be
lots of studio space

14:40.547 --> 14:42.013
In the city.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.249
Jane got a story published?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.483
Why didn't she
say anything?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.586
Woman:
<i>Pay attention.</i>

14:48.588 --> 14:51.022
(over tv): This is important.
Not only for my client,

14:51.024 --> 14:53.591
Petra solano,

14:53.593 --> 14:57.562
But for all women who enter into
nonbiological birth contracts.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.198
We are pioneering a new frontier

15:00.200 --> 15:01.599
In reproductive rights.
Rafael: Enough.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.370
Okay, so she hired
a big shot lawyer.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.505
That doesn't make her case
more valid.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.276
No, it doesn't. Unfortunately,
it does make the prospect

15:11.278 --> 15:13.344
Of shutting it down
more challenging.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.545
Okay, that's it.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.947
We'll offer
her a payout.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.449
I really think
she'll take it.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.356
Oh.
Hi.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.424
Hi.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.426
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.428
Are you okay?
What's going on?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.398
No, michael, I'm okay.
It's not your responsibility.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.566
I don't care. What-what is it?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.568
Jane, please.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.038
I just... You seem
really upset.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.372
Tell me why.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.575
Please.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.577
It's petra.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.047
She's making a play at custody
for the baby.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.481
What?
I know.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.950
That doesn't make any sense.
I know.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.218
She probably won't win,
but it's just this idea

15:54.220 --> 15:56.287
Of being in a long,
drawn-out court case.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.555
What does she want, money?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.290
It has to be.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.425
She doesn't want a kid.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.961
Okay.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.495
Maybe I can help.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.501
Aren't you nervous?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.403
I mean, putting her on tv?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.405
What if milos sees her?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.408
Please. Milos isn't watching
local miami news.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.478
And it's the only way
to get rafael to settle.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.480
(sniffs)
my god,

16:22.482 --> 16:25.650
It smells like
a kielbasa factory in here.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.221
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ivan realized</i>

16:30.223 --> 16:32.056
<i>The matches were a sign.</i>

16:32.058 --> 16:34.492
<i>He could escape</i>
<i>just like santos.</i>

16:37.396 --> 16:39.497
<i>As soon as he saw</i>
<i>the next episode.</i>

16:39.499 --> 16:42.467
Magda, I am so hungry.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.735
(groans)
could...

16:43.737 --> 16:45.203
I have some more pretzels?

16:45.205 --> 16:47.505
You'd never guess

16:47.507 --> 16:51.309
I was the one in the wheelchair
and you were the hostage.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.482
Rafael: <i>Wait, what are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

16:57.484 --> 16:59.283
Zaz's murder is still unsolved,
and, officially,

16:59.285 --> 17:00.718
Petra is still
a person of interest.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.121
I can work as an informant
and gather information

17:03.123 --> 17:04.756
For the ongoing investigation.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.025
So, what, you're just
gonna wear a wire

17:07.027 --> 17:08.459
When you
talk to her?
Yes.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.294
Official police business.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.063
And michael can...

17:12.765 --> 17:14.465
And you can listen in

17:14.467 --> 17:16.034
And record everything.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.668
If I can get her on tape
admitting that she will

17:17.670 --> 17:20.138
Drop the custody claim
for the right price,

17:20.140 --> 17:22.573
We can get this thrown out
for good.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.575
I just... I don't know
if we should involve michael.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.310
The guy's got it out for me.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.046
He's just trying to help.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.049
It's a... It's a little naive.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.052
I think this is
a legitimate solution.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.820
It could shut it down.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.623
Look, I already worked out
a number with my lawyer.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.292
I'm gonna make her
an offer, okay?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.294
Maybe she'll accept it,
maybe she'll sign the papers,

17:43.296 --> 17:45.596
And then she'll leave us alone.
And what if she says no?

17:45.598 --> 17:48.666
Then we'll go a little higher.
Yeah, and then this will
just drag on. You know it will.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.635
There's no guarantee
that she's gonna say yes.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.236
And, honestly, I just think that
throwing money at the problem

17:52.238 --> 17:53.571
Is not the answer.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.074
Did you just say
"throwing money at it"?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.543
It's a band-aid.
It's not a permanent solution.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.079
Okay, just to be clear,
money is not some evil thing.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.580
All right? It can
be very helpful.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.383
And to say that it's not,
again, is just naive.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.784
Okay, you need to stop
calling me naive.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.553
Because you're the one
that married petra.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.656
That's the reason
why we're in this situation.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.561
All right, I asked around.
If rafael's

18:16.563 --> 18:17.762
In the drug trade,
he's deep, deep underground

18:17.764 --> 18:20.765
Because no one's heard
of him.
(groans)

18:20.767 --> 18:22.133
Damn it.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.468
On the upside,

18:23.470 --> 18:24.869
Here's his wallet.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.771
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't ask you

18:26.773 --> 18:28.673
To steal this.
It's no big deal.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.708
He lost it.
He'll... Find it again tomorrow.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.510
In the meantime,
check it out, huh?

18:32.512 --> 18:35.780
There's a key
sewn in here.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.748
Hmm? You don't sew a key

18:37.750 --> 18:40.318
Into a wallet
unless you're hiding something.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.632
And I'm sending professional
hair and makeup here.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.634
My gift to you.
Ay.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.637
You will likely be on camera
when I win.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.339
You don't look excited.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.807
Why are you not excited?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.776
So how was your meeting
at the record label?

19:08.413 --> 19:10.414
<i>Â¿quÃ©?</i>

19:10.416 --> 19:12.183
That is ridiculous.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.518
I don't know.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.720
Maybe it's time
to get realistic.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.255
Face the fact

19:17.257 --> 19:20.458
That I missed my window.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.462
â™ª libre, como el mismo aire,
vive libre â™ª

19:24.464 --> 19:27.632
â™ª como lo hace el viento,
vuela libre... â™ª

19:27.634 --> 19:29.534
Alba.
Hmm?

19:30.936 --> 19:32.603
Mm-hmm.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.679
Thanks, ma, but I think
it's time to let it go.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.716
Ay, mi amor.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.487
Oh, no.
Did the meeting not go well?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.689
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.457
Easy.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.560
Loose. You know.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.671
You read my story.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.307
I borrowed your
computer, and I saw it.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.543
And I'm sorry for clicking.
I shouldn't have done that.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.681
And I first want to say
that I am really proud of you

20:16.683 --> 20:18.482
That they are publishing it.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.517
Mom...

20:19.519 --> 20:20.551
But wow.
(chuckles)

20:20.553 --> 20:22.987
"she puts the 'loose' in lucy"?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.656
You might as well
have called her xo the ho.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.991
Mom, I...
(sighs)

20:26.993 --> 20:29.427
I exaggerated for comic effect.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.829
But, I mean, is this what
you really think about me?
No.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.532
Mom, just please, listen...
Do you wish that
I was somebody else?

20:34.534 --> 20:36.567
The kind of mom that-that
wears bulky christmas sweaters

20:36.569 --> 20:37.969
And bakes a lot?

20:37.971 --> 20:39.570
No. Of course not.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.340
Lucy's daughter jen
seems to feel differently.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.410
(sighs)

20:48.914 --> 20:52.617
Look... I get the
exaggeration.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.688
But underneath it all,
is that how you feel?

20:58.490 --> 21:02.526
I did sometimes,
growing up.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.595
You were always dating
different guys.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.897
I didn't bring them home.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.899
Doesn't mean
I didn't know about them.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.571
And, you know,
except for anthony,

21:13.573 --> 21:16.007
No one ever really stuck.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.510
(sniffles)

21:19.512 --> 21:21.712
What do you remember
about anthony?

21:23.482 --> 21:25.283
I liked him.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.351
He was funny, he made me laugh.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.587
Yeah, he did.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.657
And after he broke up with me,
you were very sad.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.358
Do you remember that?

21:34.360 --> 21:38.763
I didn't want that to
happen again, so after...

21:38.765 --> 21:40.531
I kept things casual.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.635
To protect me?

21:44.637 --> 21:47.038
Yeah.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.941
That was really nice, mom.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.044
But enough already.

21:53.046 --> 21:55.546
All right, with...
With all the sacrificing.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.815
I'm-I'm a grown-up, okay?

21:57.817 --> 22:02.486
And-and you deserve to have
a happy, long-term relationship.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.722
That's what I want for you.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.326
Thanks, jane.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.594
And don't worry.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.497
I'm not going to sign that
publishing consent form anyway.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.033
Oh. I signed it for you.

22:16.035 --> 22:16.867
What?!

22:16.869 --> 22:18.803
I am not gonna be

22:18.805 --> 22:21.972
The reason that you
miss your window.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.975
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh.</i>

22:24.977 --> 22:26.977
<i>If only all mothers</i>
<i>were this unselfish.</i>

22:26.979 --> 22:28.813
Hand me my red
nail polish.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.415
The blood red.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.955
It is amazing the two of you
can still be so civil

22:37.957 --> 22:40.791
After everything that
happened with milos.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.629
We don't talk about milos.

22:45.631 --> 22:46.797
It is easier for you, no?

22:46.799 --> 22:49.367
You don't have horrible scar.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.001
You can still walk.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.138
Magda:
He's right, petra.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.639
It is not easy

22:55.641 --> 22:56.774
For me.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.976
I'm sorry about milos, mother.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.945
I should have
listened to you.
Yes.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.680
You should have.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.617
(siren wailing)

23:06.619 --> 23:08.886
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, that seems</i>
<i>a little dramatic.</i>

23:08.888 --> 23:10.955
<i>It was only five years ago.</i>

23:17.062 --> 23:20.798
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yup, you guessed it. Milos.</i>

23:25.837 --> 23:28.172
<i>The breakup did not go well,</i>
<i>to say the least.</i>

23:29.775 --> 23:31.409
<i>As luck would have it,</i>
<i>petra saw</i>

23:31.411 --> 23:33.711
<i>A koruna on the street</i>
<i>at that very moment,</i>

23:33.713 --> 23:35.713
<i>And ducked down to pick it up.</i>

23:35.715 --> 23:38.783
<i>Her mother, on the other hand,</i>
<i>was not as lucky.</i>

23:38.785 --> 23:40.418
(gasps)
mother!

23:40.420 --> 23:42.853
(screaming)
(car horn blaring, crash)

23:42.855 --> 23:45.022
Petra: <i>I will never</i>
<i>forgive myself for that.</i>

23:45.024 --> 23:47.658
Never.
I know.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.535
(sighs)

24:03.675 --> 24:06.577
(sighs)

24:06.579 --> 24:08.646
(phone chimes)

24:34.906 --> 24:37.575
(sighs)

25:14.613 --> 25:16.680
(door opens in distance)

25:28.727 --> 25:30.794
Passports, cash,
a burner phone.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.796
I knew it. I knew
something was going on.

25:32.798 --> 25:36.066
Now I just got to find it
all again... With a warrant.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.010
(women laughing)

25:46.012 --> 25:49.947
Can you imagine
if you actually got the baby?

25:53.885 --> 25:55.686
Enough. I've been dealing
with telenovelas all day...

25:55.688 --> 25:57.321
No! No, the show.
I am watching show.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.956
...For the after party.
I need a break.
I am watching this show!

25:58.958 --> 26:00.824
Jane wants to meet.
Please.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.126
Turn tv on.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.962
I need to see santos.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.997
Okay, geez, relax.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.973
(crying, speaking quietly
in spanish)

26:18.610 --> 26:21.211
Petra: I have to go
meet jane, mother.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.653
Thanks for meeting me.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.889
I was thrilled you reached out.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.092
I really think we can solve this
in a civil way.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.226
I do, too.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.928
Do you want to order food,
or...?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.663
Petra: No, thank you.
I'm really not hungry.

26:39.665 --> 26:42.800
Thanks for letting me
listen in.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.635
I just want what's
best for jane.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.837
Me, too.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.706
I can see why
you'd be concerned.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.308
There's a lot of criminal
activity in this hotel.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.844
Jane: Because I want
to facilitate a solution.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.679
I'm just trying
to focus on jane.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.981
Petra:
Fantastic.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.283
A solution
sounds great.
Agreed.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.285
So, what is it
you're looking for?

27:01.287 --> 27:02.987
Uh, in terms of visitation?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.822
No, not in terms of visitation.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.191
Look, I can talk to
rafael, I can convince him

27:07.193 --> 27:08.626
To give you whatever you want.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.995
Well, that's-that's fantastic.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.830
'cause what I really,

27:12.832 --> 27:14.698
Truly want is this baby.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.636
Well, that's not gonna happen,
but I can assure you

27:18.638 --> 27:21.372
That the baby is going to be
just fine... With me.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.108
Are you sure
you can learn to love a child

27:24.110 --> 27:25.943
That you never even wanted?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.978
I am sure.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.813
I love this child-- <i>my</i> child.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.348
But what's wrong
with more people loving it?

27:31.350 --> 27:32.916
More people will love it,
like rafael.

27:32.918 --> 27:36.053
And me. See, I'm already
attached to it.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.889
I don't believe you.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.393
You don't really know
anything about me, do you?

27:42.395 --> 27:44.395
We're actually alike,
you and I.

27:44.397 --> 27:47.698
I really, <i>really</i>
<i>don't think so.</i>

27:49.100 --> 27:51.969
You think I don't know
what it means to struggle?

27:51.971 --> 27:54.238
Just like you, it's always been
me and my mother.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.839
My father was trapped

27:55.841 --> 27:57.808
Behind the iron curtain
during the cold war.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.043
When I was a baby,

27:59.045 --> 28:01.378
He sent me and my mother off
to west germany.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.914
He was meant to follow.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.315
For five years,

28:05.317 --> 28:07.718
We waited for him.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.820
But he couldn't get out.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.289
And he died one week--
<i>one week--</i>

28:12.291 --> 28:14.158
Before the wall fell.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.827
I'll never forget that feeling.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.996
Losing someone,

28:18.998 --> 28:21.265
Never getting the chance
to know them.

28:23.401 --> 28:25.836
(sniffles)

28:25.838 --> 28:28.839
That's why
I'm fighting for this baby.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.949
Nothing. Nothing.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.184
I know. I'm sorry.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.351
Where's rafael?

28:41.353 --> 28:43.387
Uh, he took-took off.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.722
What? Why?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.090
Uh, honestly, I don't know.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.958
He just kind of
stood up and left.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.026
But, um, listen, I-I...

28:49.028 --> 28:50.994
I do want to talk to you
about him.

28:50.996 --> 28:54.064
Something's going on with him,
something shady.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.266
What? What are you
talking about?

28:56.268 --> 28:58.335
I can't say.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.070
(laughs)
but trust me, jane.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.005
I only want
what's best for you.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.942
(sighs) rafael said that
you had it in for him.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.777
I said no.

29:06.779 --> 29:09.446
Well, there you go. You see,
he said that to cover himself

29:09.448 --> 29:11.014
In case I said something.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.449
Michael, stop.
Jane.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.251
Jane, listen.
No, just stop.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.954
Something's off with this guy.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.056
(knocking)
it's-it's open.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.095
What's going on?
Why'd you run off?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.064
When petra was talking
about her father,

29:27.066 --> 29:29.066
Did she seem like she was lying?

29:29.068 --> 29:31.034
No. That was the one moment

29:31.036 --> 29:33.103
I thought she was telling
the truth.
Exactly.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.839
Me, too. So I came up here
to check some facts.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.274
What facts?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.343
The iron curtain divided
europe into two separate areas

29:39.345 --> 29:42.045
From 1945
until the berlin wall fell

29:42.047 --> 29:43.847
In November of 1989.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.516
Why am I getting
a history lesson?

29:45.518 --> 29:47.284
Because petra said
that her father died

29:47.286 --> 29:49.052
One week before
the berlin wall fell,

29:49.054 --> 29:52.322
But according to everything she
ever told me and her passport,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.992
Petra was born in <i>December</i>

29:54.994 --> 29:56.994
Of 1989.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.996
So either she can

29:58.998 --> 30:01.565
Miraculously recall events
from before she was born...

30:01.567 --> 30:05.102
Or she's not
who she says she is.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.976
And we're live
from the red carpet

30:12.978 --> 30:14.178
Of the 14th annual
paloma awards.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.445
For the first time ever,

30:15.447 --> 30:17.281
We're hosting
them in beautiful

30:17.283 --> 30:19.449
Downtown miami.
All your favorite

30:19.451 --> 30:23.220
Telenovela stars are swarming
the red carpet as we speak.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.189
And of course,
one of the fiercest rivalries

30:25.191 --> 30:28.225
Of the night centers around
the best actor category.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.961
I have the two front-runners
here with me tonight--

30:30.963 --> 30:32.462
Rogelio de la vega
and esteban santiago.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.364
How are the two of you
feeling tonight?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.233
Wonderful.
Many may think we are rivals,

30:36.235 --> 30:38.101
But we're actually
very close friends.
Oh, yes?

30:38.103 --> 30:41.071
Yes, in fact, rogelio is
like a father to me.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.540
Which is remarkable, since
we're actually the same age.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.908
(sighs)

30:44.910 --> 30:46.410
I feel for esteban.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.111
He's tremendously overrated.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.280
There's nowhere for
him to go but down.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.484
Sorry I'm late. There's dramatic
stuff going on at the house.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.853
Announcer:
Please make your way inside.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.521
The show is about to begin.

31:01.192 --> 31:05.295
I need you to dig up as much as
you can as quickly as you can.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.132
(woman speaking spanish over tv)

31:11.569 --> 31:13.103
Oh, there...

31:13.105 --> 31:15.539
There, a storm coming.
You see that?

31:15.541 --> 31:18.208
We should probably
go to basement.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.177
You could take
off my cuffs.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.513
I would not run.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.515
Nice try.

31:25.517 --> 31:29.186
And now,
best villain in a telenovela.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.590
Get back to work.
The guests will be here soon.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.893
And now, the award
we've all been waiting for,

31:35.895 --> 31:38.896
Best actor in a dramatic series.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.198
The nominees are:

31:41.200 --> 31:43.667
Mateo alvarado,
<i>the boldness of love.</i>

31:43.669 --> 31:47.271
Enrique maldonado,
<i>beautiful forever.</i>

31:47.273 --> 31:50.974
Esteban santiago,
<i>the glory and the temptation.</i>

31:50.976 --> 31:55.212
And rogelio de la vega,
<i>the passions of santos.</i>

31:57.148 --> 31:58.315
And the winner is...

31:58.317 --> 31:59.650
(drumroll)

32:01.152 --> 32:02.219
Esteban santiago!

32:04.589 --> 32:06.657
(applause)

32:12.430 --> 32:14.598
I meant to do that.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.500
It'll go viral.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.135
One of those memes.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.536
Esteban:
Thank you so much

32:19.538 --> 32:22.039
To god for creating me
in his image.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.107
(phone chirps)

32:28.012 --> 32:30.314
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But though the award show</i>
<i>was over,</i>

32:30.316 --> 32:32.716
<i>The drama was just getting</i>
<i>started at the after party.</i>

32:32.718 --> 32:35.052
What's so important?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.287
I organized this party.
I need to be out there.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.323
We hired a private investigator.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.324
What?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.292
The best one money could buy.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.227
Turns out the real petra,
the one whose passport

32:44.229 --> 32:46.096
You've been carrying around--

32:46.098 --> 32:48.999
Well, she died
in the czech republic in 2008.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.234
So that leaves us
with a big question.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.403
Who the hell are you?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.072
Ivan:
Natalia.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.229
Rafael:
We'll keep digging

33:19.231 --> 33:21.264
Until we uncover
exactly who you are

33:21.266 --> 33:22.733
And what you're hiding,
unless

33:22.735 --> 33:24.468
You sign the divorce papers

33:24.470 --> 33:27.337
And agree
to stay the hell away from us

33:27.339 --> 33:29.673
And our baby.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.448
Okay. Yes.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.386
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

33:42.388 --> 33:45.122
<i>That at this moment--</i>
<i>god or no god--</i>

33:45.124 --> 33:47.324
<i>It felt like a miracle.</i>

33:47.326 --> 33:49.493
<i>Indeed, there was something</i>
<i>in the air that night,</i>

33:49.495 --> 33:51.661
<i>And it was not just</i>
<i>the strong wind</i>

33:51.663 --> 33:54.331
<i>Mixed with the smell</i>
<i>of mushroom croquettes.</i>

33:54.333 --> 33:56.600
<i>It was something more magical.</i>

33:56.602 --> 33:58.468
(gasps)

34:02.440 --> 34:05.142
I'm sorry. I've had
a little too much champagne,

34:05.144 --> 34:09.579
But you look just like
paulina rubio.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.248
I get that a lot.

34:11.250 --> 34:15.685
'cause I am paulina rubio.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.687
Oh, my god.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.523
You're just...

34:19.525 --> 34:21.324
I'm a singer,

34:21.326 --> 34:24.461
And you're just pretty much
god to me, so...

34:24.463 --> 34:26.630
Thank you. Thank you.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.365
What's your name?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.567
Um, xiomara.
Xiomara.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.835
Or you can call me xo.

34:31.837 --> 34:35.539
Or, you know,
whatever you want, really.

34:35.541 --> 34:36.807
What type of music do you sing?

34:36.809 --> 34:38.642
I sing pop, mostly.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.545
Well, no, I-I did. Uh...

34:41.547 --> 34:44.848
Things never really
took off for me.

34:44.850 --> 34:48.485
I actually think it's best I...
I let it go, you know.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.720
I missed my window.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.589
If it's your calling,

34:52.591 --> 34:55.392
If it's what
you're meant to do,

34:55.394 --> 34:56.827
There's no window.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.729
Lots of people tried
to tell me to give up.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.598
What if I'd listened?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.633
(clicks tongue)
no, <i>chica.</i>

35:03.635 --> 35:07.604
If you have it, if you really
want it, you do it.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.806
I got to go.
I have a big

35:09.808 --> 35:13.343
Concert tonight, but... You...

35:13.345 --> 35:15.278
You have something special.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.646
Stick to it, okay?

35:23.354 --> 35:26.523
So, you were right
to go to michael,

35:26.525 --> 35:29.693
And I was right to throw money
at an expensive p.I.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.495
Lesson learned.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.296
Yeah? What is that lesson?

35:33.298 --> 35:34.464
We're better together.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.467
Really? Because
I think the lesson is,

35:37.469 --> 35:40.237
Is that we're very different,
and there are a lot of things

35:40.239 --> 35:41.805
That are gonna come up
because of that.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.841
No. Refer back to my lesson.

35:44.843 --> 35:48.645
We are better... Together.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.882
And we'll
figure it out, jane.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.416
Whatever comes up--
school, religion,

35:53.418 --> 35:55.152
Or the other hundred things

35:55.154 --> 35:58.522
That we haven't thought about
yet-- we will figure it out.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.724
Okay?

36:05.263 --> 36:10.233
Why don't you tell
your 14-year-old self

36:10.235 --> 36:13.570
That we're cleared
for kissing, okay?

36:13.572 --> 36:15.639
Oh, thank you.

36:17.575 --> 36:19.409
(both sigh)

36:19.411 --> 36:21.311
Petra:
<i>I've lost everything.</i>

36:21.313 --> 36:24.648
We need to start over.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.616
Again.

36:26.618 --> 36:31.254
Maybe we should just
stop running, just go home,

36:31.256 --> 36:33.623
And if milos finds us,
then so be it.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.425
Don't say that.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.726
Never say that.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.696
You took care
of me then.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.765
I will take care of you now.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.269
Hey.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.571
Sorry you didn't win.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.439
I don't have
the shelf space, anyway.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.840
I-I didn't win either.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.643
We made this wager at work
about who would win best actor.

36:53.645 --> 36:54.811
I bet on you.

36:54.813 --> 36:58.215
You did?
Of course.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.651
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And for a brief moment,</i>
<i>rogelio felt like he had won.</i>

37:01.653 --> 37:03.720
You're not gonna believe this.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.855
I just met paulina rubio!

37:05.857 --> 37:08.825
Are you serious?
Just now.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.861
Outside.
It was magical.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.997
She told me
not to give up on my dream.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.599
Oh, my god, that's awesome.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.002
(phone chirps)

37:19.004 --> 37:20.870
I'm very happy for you, xiomara.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.973
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.381
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ah.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.416
You didn't tell xiomara
I sent you, right?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.718
Oh, of course not, rogelio.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.553
Don't worry about that.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.755
I mean, this is not you.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.724
Doing something nice
for someone

37:40.726 --> 37:42.859
And not willing
to take the credit?

37:42.861 --> 37:45.328
(speaks spanish)
she is.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.730
Thank you for helping me.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.932
Whatever you want.
You know that, okay?

37:48.934 --> 37:50.934
Really?

37:50.936 --> 37:53.403
Will you do an appearance
on one of my telenovelas?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.938
(chuckles, speaks spanish)

37:54.940 --> 37:56.573
You're so funny.

37:56.575 --> 37:57.907
Yeah. Uh...
I love you. No.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.709
Oh.
That's not gonna
happen ever.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.511
'cause you could be
whatever you want.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.679
You could be a pirate.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.756
Uh, ma, why don't you
have a seat.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.025
Hmm?
Yeah, maybe
we should get you some water.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.793
She's drunk.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.762
She's the best.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.363
(both laugh)

38:20.365 --> 38:21.865
Can I have some water, please?

38:21.867 --> 38:24.434
Hey, uh, what's going on
with you and rogelio?

38:24.436 --> 38:26.536
What do you mean?

38:26.538 --> 38:27.837
Come on.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.439
You guys obviously
like each other.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.408
I saw all the
googly eyes.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.076
Why don't you go for it?

38:33.078 --> 38:35.445
We're over that
commitment-phobia, remember?

38:35.447 --> 38:37.814
Okay, I am not gonna
let go of this,

38:37.816 --> 38:39.616
So you might as well tell me.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.787
The truth is, I've been
staying away from rogelio

38:43.789 --> 38:46.089
So that he can focus
on his relationship with you.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.024
I don't want it
to get complicated

38:48.026 --> 38:50.093
If things don't work out
with us romantically.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.930
Again, super sweet, mom, but
enough with the sacrifices.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.901
Not that I buy that it was
completely about me, anyway.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.369
What do you mean?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.938
Maybe sometimes
you use me as an excuse.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.740
Because one thing I do remember

39:03.742 --> 39:06.843
About your breakup with anthony
was how sad you were.

39:08.112 --> 39:11.781
Yeah, well, getting hurt sucks.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.384
I know.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.353
But that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't take a shot

39:16.355 --> 39:18.988
At doing something that
might make you really happy.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.827
What is this about?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.929
Nadine:
Mr. Solano, we have

39:25.931 --> 39:28.098
A warrant to search a safe
in this office.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.567
A warrant? Based on what?

39:30.569 --> 39:32.469
Based on a statement
from a hotel employee

39:32.471 --> 39:33.870
Who said the safe contains
criminal material.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.972
Billy: <i>I was passing by,</i>
<i>and I saw</i>

39:35.974 --> 39:37.707
What looked like
a stack of passports.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.142
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And just like that,</i>

39:39.144 --> 39:42.779
<i>Billy's $350 became $500.</i>

39:48.686 --> 39:49.886
No.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.721
(laughs) no.

39:51.723 --> 39:52.922
No. No way.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.894
I'm gonna go now.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.501
(door closes)

40:04.503 --> 40:05.969
(shouts):
No!

40:07.738 --> 40:09.506
Nadine:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40:09.508 --> 40:11.141
A man vanishes from the room,

40:11.143 --> 40:12.742
Things are disappearing
from safes.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.810
Michael, calm down.

40:13.812 --> 40:14.978
How am I so far behind?

40:14.980 --> 40:16.179
Hey, hey, hey!
What am I missing?

40:16.181 --> 40:17.947
Hey, stop!
What am I...

40:21.152 --> 40:22.819
What is going on?

40:22.821 --> 40:26.856
I don't know, but
you need a break.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.099
Nadine...

40:46.177 --> 40:47.977
(mechanical whirring)

40:57.788 --> 41:01.191
What the hell?

41:01.193 --> 41:02.892
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

41:02.894 --> 41:04.861
<i>An unexpected twist.</i>

41:04.863 --> 41:07.797
<i>Meanwhile, a tipsy alba</i>
<i>had decided</i>

41:07.799 --> 41:10.767
<i>To give petra</i>
<i>a piece of her mind after all.</i>

41:17.875 --> 41:19.976
Get out!
Ivan:
Please!

41:19.978 --> 41:21.845
Please call the police!
I need help! I'm tied up!

41:21.847 --> 41:23.012
Get out! Get out!

41:23.014 --> 41:24.614
Go get help!

41:34.892 --> 41:36.893
(door creaks)

41:36.895 --> 41:38.962
(panting)

41:40.064 --> 41:42.065
(gasps)

41:56.614 --> 42:00.016
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I told you the drama</i>
<i>was just getting started.</i>
