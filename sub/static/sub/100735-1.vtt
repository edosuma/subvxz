WEBVTT

01:37.681 --> 01:39.975
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin,

01:40.058 --> 01:45.647
it is my duty to remind you that
a grand jury proceeding is not a trial.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.609
As you can see, there is no judge
in the room here with us,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.444
no defense attorneys.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.740
This is an investigatory process,
at the end of which

01:54.823 --> 01:57.284
you will be asked to decide
whether or not I have provided you

01:57.367 --> 02:01.747
with sufficient evidence
to grant a true bill of indictment.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.751
If so,
I may take the case to superior court.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.588
If not, if you return a decision
of "no bill,"

02:09.670 --> 02:12.799
then this case ends here, today.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.762
Could you state your name
for the record, please?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.267
You were asked to state your name.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.103
Andrew Stephen Barber.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.315
Little louder, if you don't mind.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.073
Andrew Stephen Barber.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.575
Can you state your occupation, please?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.328
I was an assistant district attorney
in this building for ten years.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.579
"Was"?

02:43.330 --> 02:46.041
So you're no longer employed
as a prosecutor

02:46.124 --> 02:48.252
for Middlesex County, is that correct?

02:48.335 --> 02:49.795
Yes. That's right.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.381
Mr. Barber...

02:54.258 --> 02:55.259
Andy.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.013
I assume you're familiar
with your Fifth Amendment rights?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.098
I would hope so.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.225
And you've waived them, correct?

03:03.308 --> 03:04.643
I'm here, aren't I?

03:04.726 --> 03:09.189
Would you agree that it's a little
unusual, given the circumstances?

03:09.273 --> 03:12.359
I don't have any tricks up my sleeve,
if that's what you're getting at.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.780
-No one was implying that.
-Yes, you were. So would I.

03:17.781 --> 03:22.327
I'm here 'cause I believe in the system
and just want the truth to come out.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.248
Well, let's get started on the truth then.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.003
I'd like to begin by reading a quote
from The Boston Globe

03:31.086 --> 03:32.671
that ran a few weeks ago.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.512
"They became national news,

03:40.596 --> 03:45.559
an object of fascination for both
the NPR set and the TMZ crowd,

03:45.642 --> 03:47.519
the subject of a popular podcast,

03:47.603 --> 03:50.439
hundreds of editorials
and countless articles.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.566
So it's easy to forget
that less than a year ago

03:52.649 --> 03:55.986
their lives were as mundane and uneventful
as our own.

03:56.486 --> 04:00.616
Is there such a thing
as the perfect family? Of course not.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.994
But the Barber family was a happy family,

04:04.578 --> 04:09.041
and if there was anything truly special
about them, it was this."

04:14.379 --> 04:16.214
I wonder if you'd agree.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.510
Is that an accurate description
of your family

04:19.593 --> 04:22.304
on the morning that Ben Rifkin
was murdered?

04:22.387 --> 04:23.722
"Happy"?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.269
Yes.

04:34.024 --> 04:37.277
Hey. Come on. Time to get up.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.405
Let's go. Rise and shine.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.536
Jake? Gotta see those eyes.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.456
All right. You leave me no choice.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.297
Last chance.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.436
-I'm up. I'm up.
-There he is!

05:11.520 --> 05:12.646
Morning, buddy.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.800
Can you quiz me on vocab?
I have a test today.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.511
-Oh. Good morning to you too.
-Morning, Mom.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.763
You need a ride today, or are you walking?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.516
No, I'll walk. Did you get new waffles?

05:49.600 --> 05:53.020
I did if you put them on my list.
"Perspicacious."

05:53.103 --> 05:55.689
"Having a keen understanding."
They're not in here.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.524
-Did you put them on my list?
-Yes.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.943
Then they're in there. "Cursory."

06:00.027 --> 06:02.154
"Brief and lacking depth."
I don't see them.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.032
Second shelf next to the peas. "Myopic."

06:05.115 --> 06:06.450
I'm telling you, they're not--

06:07.159 --> 06:09.828
-"Myopic."
-"Possessing a narrow view."

06:10.913 --> 06:12.122
How was the run?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.791
-"Recalcitrant."
-Yikes.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.001
Vocab test.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.669
Hey, would you throw one of those in there
for me, buddy?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.922
"Recalcitrant." I don't know.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.508
-"Defying authority."
-Are you sure? Let me see.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.510
-That's what it says.
-Where'd you run?

06:24.593 --> 06:27.846
Along Boylston. I got lost
in that history podcast I told you about.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.598
I think you'd really like it.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.767
-I'll check it out.
-No, you won't.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.229
Oh, Claudia Hoffman e-mailed me again.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.313
Who?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.815
Lizzy's sister. The travel agent?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.817
-Oh, right, right. Mexico.
-Yeah.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.902
What about Mexico?

06:41.985 --> 06:45.113
We're thinking about going there for
Christmas. Three of us. What do you think?

06:45.197 --> 06:46.198
Cool.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.701
-You might be a little more excited.
-I am.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.161
Well, tell your face.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.412
You love that line.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.122
You really do.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.916
Look, we need to make a decision.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.417
Should we go?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.253
I mean, Jake is obviously ecstatic.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.546
No, he's beside himself.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.005
I wouldn't wanna break his heart.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.423
What kind of parents would we be?

07:03.882 --> 07:04.883
Hilarious.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.803
-So are we going?
-I say yes. Yes to Mexico.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.388
Great. I'll call her.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.473
All right, I've got an early meeting,
so I'm jumping in the shower.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.432
Okay.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.226
-Will you finish quizzing him?
-Yeah.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.478
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.650
"Phlegmatic."

08:11.575 --> 08:13.243
I'll see you later, okay?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.895
Your Honor,
I need a couple minutes to explain.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.774
You'll have that opportunity in pretrial,
Mr. Molloy.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.901
The charge is distribution
of a class A substance.

08:45.984 --> 08:46.860
Such bullshit.

08:46.944 --> 08:50.864
Bail is set at $1,000 cash
or 10,000 personal recognizance.

08:50.948 --> 08:51.990
Come on. Are you kidding me?

08:52.074 --> 08:54.451
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-What the hell are you thanking her for?

08:54.535 --> 08:57.246
Pretrial conference is scheduled
for May 24th.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.330
Next.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.165
Please.

09:00.791 --> 09:06.129
Indictment number 17-2832,
Commonwealth versus William J. Moore.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.382
Charge is one count of aggravated assault.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.259
Is Mr. Moore's attorney present?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.343
Good morning, Your Honor.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.803
Commonwealth?

09:22.437 --> 09:25.274
Your Honor, I'm afraid
we have to insist on a continuance

09:25.357 --> 09:29.069
on the grounds that we've been unable
to interview a necessary witness.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.030
This court already granted you
a continuance four months ago.

09:32.114 --> 09:35.617
Yes, Your Honor, but this witness
has been very difficult to locate.

09:35.701 --> 09:39.830
Without getting into detail,
it has to do with her choice of lifestyle.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.164
She's an escort, Your Honor,

09:41.248 --> 09:44.042
like her friend,
who the defendant is accused of battering.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.920
Since this was an issue last time,
I had a state trooper track her down.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.213
It only took a day.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.466
She corroborated her friend's account
of the assault.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.136
She also said the defense
had already questioned her.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.971
Maybe he forgot to take notes.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.224
-Your Honor, if I may just elaborate--
-No, you may not.

09:59.558 --> 10:03.228
Continuance is denied.
Trial is set for three weeks from today.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.313
Next.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.648
All right, you're due back in
for a session in 15 minutes,

10:06.732 --> 10:08.609
then meeting with Lynn, her office.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.652
I think she wants an update
on the Willis case.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.030
Oh. That makes two of us.
Bobby, you guys out of peach?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.907
Could be. Let me check the back.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.366
Thanks. How's the hip?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.869
You know, worse than yesterday,
better than tomorrow.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.788
You wanted a conference
with Judge French in chambers.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.458
His clerk says he has a 2:30,
if you want that.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
Thank you.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.920
Hey.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.841
Oh, Jesus. Okay. Where?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.931
Okay. Yeah, I'll meet you over there.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.350
Something wrong?

10:42.184 --> 10:44.770
You're a lucky man, Mr. B.
Only got one left.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.522
-Thanks.
-What is it?

10:47.439 --> 10:48.941
We gotta clear the rest of my day.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.905
It's looking very good. No. Doing good.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.283
Be careful taking that out.
We don't wanna make a mess.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.701
That's what she said.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.455
What are we doing here?
What are you dipping? That is--

11:04.540 --> 11:08.168
Attention. Archer is now on lockdown,
effective immediately.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.128
All students are to remain
in their classrooms...

11:10.212 --> 11:12.130
All right. Okay.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.342
Guys, I can't hear the announcement.

11:21.014 --> 11:25.352
Over here, against the wall, please.
Sit down. Stay quiet.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.027
Repeat. We are now on lockdown.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.293
News didn't take long.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.129
-Yeah. It's gonna be a real shitstorm.
-Yeah.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.676
Let's go.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.520
She's the one who found the body?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.939
And the kid's backpack,
which is how they managed to ID him.

12:11.023 --> 12:14.818
Name's Benjamin Rifkin, 14 years old,
stabbed three times in the chest.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.613
Oh, fuck.

12:17.696 --> 12:21.575
He's Jacob's year at Archer.
Jesus Christ. His poor parents.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.327
I take it you know them.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.913
No, not that well.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.874
Anyway, keep going.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.044
ME thinks he was dead
less than an hour before he was found.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.421
Stabbing probably took place
on or near the jogging trail.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.381
-There's a lot of cast-off on the grounds.
-Hey, hey, hey.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.675
It's okay.
Detective Duffy is with our office.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.220
Let 'em through.
The fuck's wrong with you?

12:41.762 --> 12:44.556
Sorry, Duff. It's been a shit morning.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.394
There's nothing worse than a kid.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.442
Our thinking is,
the attack took place over there,

12:55.859 --> 12:58.237
then the body fell
or was pushed down the hill.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.532
Doesn't look like any effort was made
to conceal it.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.370
This way. Watch your step.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.418
The lady who found him
said he was facedown.

13:13.502 --> 13:16.171
She thought maybe he was sick,
so she rolled him over,

13:16.630 --> 13:18.507
took one good look at him and freaked.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.427
Crabbed away on her palms and knees,
then got up and ran.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.389
Basically fucked the whole scene.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.518
Excuse me. I have to take this.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.688
Jacob. You okay?

13:32.771 --> 13:35.649
Yeah. The school's on lockdown,
but nobody knows why.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.192
I know, it's...

13:41.905 --> 13:43.824
Look, I can't talk about it right now,
okay, buddy?

13:43.907 --> 13:46.159
Just listen to your teachers,
do exactly what they say.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.872
Yeah, but you do know why.
I mean, is there some psycho shooter?

13:49.955 --> 13:53.292
No, it's nothing like that.
You're safe. I promise.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.342
Jake?

14:03.802 --> 14:04.803
Okay.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.055
Dad?

14:07.598 --> 14:08.599
Yeah.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.645
What is it, buddy?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.150
Nothing.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.943
You sure?

14:21.653 --> 14:22.654
Yeah.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.578
Okay, I gotta go. I'll see you
back at home though, okay?

14:30.329 --> 14:31.747
I love you very much.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.168
-All right. I love you too.
-Bye.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.385
So no one in the park heard anything,
saw anything?

14:45.469 --> 14:46.678
We're still asking around.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.805
If we find his cell phone,
we can probably track his movements.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.850
-His phone's missing?
-Wasn't in his backpack or on his person.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.519
We're thinking the perp
might have taken it.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.645
What about a weapon?

14:54.728 --> 14:57.648
Nothing yet.
The park's a good 65 acres though.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.028
That's gonna be a haystack.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.785
"Children are the living messages we send
to a time we will not see."

15:10.577 --> 15:12.329
That quote from John F. Kennedy

15:12.412 --> 15:15.249
speaks directly to our work
here at Children's Cottage,

15:15.332 --> 15:19.044
where our mission has always been
to nurture those who need it most:

15:19.127 --> 15:23.590
abused, neglected and traumatized youth
in the greater Boston area.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.343
A residential campus provides not just
stability and safety...

15:26.426 --> 15:28.345
-Please pause it a sec?
-...but support.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.222
Don't you think I sound stiff?

15:30.305 --> 15:31.515
You sound great.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.851
You're just self-conscious.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.854
I sound like I'm reading a traffic report.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.273
Sorry, guys, my phone is going crazy.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.525
I just feel if we're going to start
the gala with this video,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.402
then it really needs to grab people.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.529
Newton schools are on lockdown.

15:47.823 --> 15:49.032
Turn on the news.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.621
We're reporting live
from Cold Spring Park,

15:54.705 --> 15:58.834
where earlier today the body
of a 14-year-old boy was found.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.794
-The park will remain closed...
-Oh, my God.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.921
...until further notice, as detectives
continue their investigation.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.132
Honey, it's Mom. Are you okay?

16:05.215 --> 16:06.592
The police are going door-to-door

16:06.675 --> 16:08.969
in the neighborhoods
adjacent to Cold Spring Park,

16:09.052 --> 16:11.972
hoping to find anyone
who was in the park this morning

16:12.055 --> 16:16.435
and may have seen the victim talking to
or having contact with someone else.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.312
A source inside the investigation
has confirmed

16:18.395 --> 16:20.939
that two witnesses
have come forward so far,

16:21.023 --> 16:23.192
but a suspect has yet to be named.

16:23.275 --> 16:27.237
Newton Police have set up an anonymous
hotline for anyone who frequents the park,

16:27.321 --> 16:29.781
in case they have seen
any suspicious behavior

16:29.865 --> 16:32.576
or have any information
about this tragedy.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.038
In the meantime, this tight-knit community
is on edge tonight,

16:36.121 --> 16:38.457
knowing a murderer walks among them.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.971
Can't go this way, buddy.
You gotta turn around.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.040
He came home with Derek, so we didn't--

17:22.084 --> 17:23.085
Right.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.753
How's Jennifer doing?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.634
Oh, God. These poor kids.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.387
I did.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.432
Toby said Robin's organizing food
for the shiva, so I'm going to call her.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.478
Listen, Andy just got home.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.647
You too. Bye.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.362
-Was that Karen?
-Yeah.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.072
Where's Jake?

17:52.155 --> 17:56.243
Upstairs. Derek's over.
They're playing video games in his room.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.662
You get a chance to talk to him
about it yet?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.664
Not really, with Derek here.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.457
Figure we could talk to him later.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.340
Just came from the Rifkins.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.717
Oh, my God.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.011
I can't even imagine.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.096
It was...

18:17.097 --> 18:18.223
That bad, huh?

18:20.350 --> 18:21.518
Worse.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.230
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

18:25.314 --> 18:26.315
Not yet.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.984
You said there was a fingerprint.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.154
Yeah, partial. No matches so far.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.657
I mean, how could this even happen?

18:36.241 --> 18:39.745
I can't even get my head around it.
That park is two blocks away.

18:41.038 --> 18:44.291
I'll tell you one thing, Jacob is never
walking to school that way again.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.503
I need some help here!

18:48.086 --> 18:49.588
What are you waiting for?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.381
They're gonna kill me.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.841
You said you got him.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.593
-I do. I see him.
-Right there! That guy on the left.

18:54.676 --> 18:55.719
Derek, your dad's here.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.803
Oh, okay.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.764
Get out of here!

19:00.015 --> 19:01.308
Go, go, go!

19:02.351 --> 19:04.102
-Later, Jake.
-See you.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.147
Thanks for having me,
Mrs. Barber, Mr. Barber.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.232
Anytime.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.484
-You all right?
-I guess. Yeah.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.277
Give our best to your parents, okay?

19:12.903 --> 19:13.904
Yeah.

19:15.906 --> 19:19.159
Hey, pal.
We wanted to talk to you for a second.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.036
Sure.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.957
We just want to see how you're doing,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.501
how you're feeling
about what happened to Ben.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.671
I'm fine. I mean, yeah, it's weird.

19:30.754 --> 19:34.049
But it's not like we were close friends
or anything.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.386
Well, still, it must be scary,
knowing someone that got murdered.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.971
Someone your age.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.807
I guess. I mean, yeah, a little bit.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.976
You guys were in a class together, right?

19:44.059 --> 19:45.060
Yeah, math.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.646
Was he a nice kid?

19:48.438 --> 19:51.108
Ben? He was all right.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.235
Just all right?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.947
Well, I don't wanna be mean or anything,

19:57.030 --> 19:59.700
but he was kind of full of himself,
you know?

19:59.783 --> 20:01.618
Like, he thought he was really cool.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.495
Was he?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.582
To some people, yeah. Girls were into him.

20:09.293 --> 20:12.379
Well, we just want you to know
we're here for you, okay?

20:12.963 --> 20:14.923
Whatever you're feeling, you can tell us.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.925
Kinda just did.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.221
Like I said,
I didn't really know him that well.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.557
I'm good though. Really.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.184
Okay.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.979
-We love you.
-Love you too.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.900
If you change your mind
and you want to talk to us...

20:32.983 --> 20:34.735
I know. Thank you.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.612
-Dinner in 30 minutes. Okay, pal?
-Okay.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.285
Can I admit something horrible?

20:45.871 --> 20:48.498
The whole time tonight
I kept thinking, "Thank God."

20:49.208 --> 20:51.460
"Thank God it was their kid and not mine."

20:53.629 --> 20:55.380
Believe me, everybody thought that.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.718
I just don't think
I could survive the loss. I really don't.

21:07.976 --> 21:12.105
Do you remember when Jacob was little,
your bedtime routine?

21:13.649 --> 21:16.401
You'd always ask,
"How much does Daddy love Jacob?"

21:16.485 --> 21:19.655
-And he'd say, "Too much."
-"Too much."

21:22.324 --> 21:24.493
In four years,
he'll be going off to college.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.161
-Oh, my God.
-Isn't that crazy?

21:27.538 --> 21:29.289
I can't even think about it.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.341
Do you ever wish you'd known your father?

21:42.302 --> 21:43.470
Not really.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.973
When I was younger, sometimes.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.895
From what little my mom told me,
sounds like I wasn't missing much.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.608
We should get some sleep.

21:57.609 --> 21:58.777
I know.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.738
I like talking to you.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.535
I love you.

22:07.870 --> 22:09.204
I love you too.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.182
Look at me!

23:03.592 --> 23:04.843
Thanks, Mom.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.553
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

23:07.679 --> 23:08.764
Love you.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.357
I'll meet you in class.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.814
Have a seat.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.233
I thought that press conference
went well enough.

24:01.316 --> 24:04.903
They want answers, Andy.
So do the boy's parents.

24:04.987 --> 24:07.281
Yeah, so do I. You know as well as I--

24:07.739 --> 24:09.825
-I asked Neal to join us.
-Andy.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.410
This isn't an ambush.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.580
I'm just not sure you handling this case
is still the best idea.

24:14.663 --> 24:17.749
You're friendly with the parents,
your son goes to the same school--

24:17.833 --> 24:19.042
We barely know the parents.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.128
Let me guess,
Rasputin here offered to take over?

24:21.211 --> 24:24.131
Neal has legitimate concerns
about the appearance of conflict.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.550
And frankly, so do I.
Appearances matter.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.427
-Yeah, to voters.
-Oh, come on now.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.679
-Sorry.
-It's a question of objectivity.

24:30.762 --> 24:31.638
Shut up, Neal.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.223
Are you taking me off the case?
Yes or no.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.809
Right now I'm merely asking
what you think.

24:35.893 --> 24:37.144
I think I should stay on.

24:37.227 --> 24:39.855
If I were more concerned about
my reputation, maybe I'd feel differently.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.608
But unlike Mr. Logiudice here,
I'm not gunning for your job.

24:42.691 --> 24:43.901
Fuck off, Andy. Okay?

24:43.984 --> 24:47.404
Hey, I get it. High-profile case,
big splashy win... Be a game changer.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.822
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

24:48.906 --> 24:50.699
-Gentlemen.
-You're dragging your feet on this case.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.868
The case is going slow
'cause that's how the case is going.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.786
I'm not going to indict someone
just to make it look good.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.705
You always told me
to push every case as hard as I could.

24:56.788 --> 24:57.915
I am pushing it as hard as I can.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.583
Then why haven't you interviewed
any of the kids?

24:59.666 --> 25:02.169
Because it isn't Dorchester High, Neal.
It's Newton.

25:02.252 --> 25:06.048
Every single detail has to be negotiated.
Half the parents there are lawyers.

25:07.591 --> 25:11.178
Look, we got interviews lined up all day.
You wanna send Neal? Be my guest.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.013
I have concerns, I voiced them.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.182
-If you say there's no conflict--
-There isn't.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.434
I don't know how you can be the one
to make that call.

25:17.518 --> 25:21.230
Because that's the way it works, Neal.
I make the calls.

25:23.482 --> 25:27.152
And if I'm wrong, I'll be the one to stand
in front of the jury and take the hit.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.364
Okay.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.993
-Thank you.
-Of course, Andy.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.037
-I'll keep you updated.
-Please do.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.707
We've gotten consent
to fingerprint most of the kids.

25:40.791 --> 25:42.751
I think we start
with high-priority witnesses.

25:42.835 --> 25:46.421
Ben's close friends, kids known to
walk to school through Cold Spring Park.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.049
I'm Lieutenant Duffy.
I'm with the state police.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.133
And this is Mr. Barber.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.761
He's the assistant district attorney
in charge of the case.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.389
You're Jacob's dad, aren't you?

25:55.472 --> 25:56.849
That's right.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.059
So how well did you know Ben?
Was he a friend?

25:59.142 --> 26:00.352
Yeah, I guess.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.020
Tell us about him.

26:02.104 --> 26:03.063
He was okay.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.274
Can you be a little more specific?

26:05.858 --> 26:06.900
He was nice.

26:07.568 --> 26:08.610
Anything else?

26:09.027 --> 26:10.612
I don't know. No, not really.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.532
Can you think of anyone that would've
had a reason to wanna hurt Ben?

26:13.615 --> 26:14.992
I don't think so. No.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.702
What about people Ben didn't like?

26:16.785 --> 26:19.746
I don't know.
I mean, nobody likes everybody, right?

26:21.582 --> 26:23.917
Wait, are you Jacob Barber's dad?

26:26.378 --> 26:28.964
Can you think of anyone
who might have a reason to wanna hurt Ben?

26:29.423 --> 26:30.465
-No.
-No.

26:31.008 --> 26:32.092
No.

26:32.176 --> 26:35.012
Did Ben say anything to you that made you
think he might be in trouble?

26:35.095 --> 26:36.054
In trouble?

26:36.138 --> 26:37.639
In trouble? How?

26:37.723 --> 26:40.934
Did Ben ever say anything to you
to make you think he might be in trouble?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.102
No.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.562
-No.
-No.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.813
No.

26:47.524 --> 26:50.277
Was Ben acting differently at all
the week that this happened?

26:50.360 --> 26:52.196
-I don't know.
-I don't think so.

26:52.279 --> 26:55.449
Never said anything about anyone
following him, anyone bothering him?

26:56.575 --> 26:59.286
-No.
-Wait, are you Jacob Barber's dad?

27:02.664 --> 27:04.708
Is there anything else
you think we should know?

27:04.791 --> 27:06.502
-No.
-Not really. No.

27:06.585 --> 27:08.295
-About Ben?
-About anything.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.049
No.

27:13.759 --> 27:16.637
Well, thanks for talking with us.
This is my card.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.223
It has all my information
if you need to get in touch.

27:19.598 --> 27:20.766
-Okay.
-Okay.

27:20.849 --> 27:23.727
If anything else occurs to you,
even if you think it's nothing...

27:25.229 --> 27:26.563
Like if I heard something?

27:26.647 --> 27:28.690
Exactly. Wait, did you hear something?

27:29.399 --> 27:30.651
No.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.778
Just, you know.

27:32.861 --> 27:33.987
No, we don't.

27:34.780 --> 27:35.781
Can I go now?

27:35.864 --> 27:37.824
-Can I go now?
-Can I go now?

27:44.414 --> 27:45.832
Let me know what I miss.

27:47.042 --> 27:49.545
So is there anything else
you want to tell me about Ben?

27:50.003 --> 27:51.129
Yeah, send it over.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.673
Okay.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.800
Well, you have both our cards.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.427
If you think of anything else,
please feel free to call anytime.

27:59.596 --> 28:02.224
The cop who came to our class
said there was a tip line.

28:02.641 --> 28:05.894
Just in case we wanted
to say something anonymously or whatever.

28:06.645 --> 28:07.896
That's right.

28:08.772 --> 28:11.775
-Is there something you want to tell us?
-No, I was just wondering.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.033
I know your son, Jacob.

28:20.993 --> 28:23.203
Oh, yeah? You guys friends?

28:23.287 --> 28:27.541
I guess so. Well, not exactly.
But, I mean, we know each other.

28:36.508 --> 28:38.719
Have you talked to Jacob about this?

28:38.802 --> 28:39.887
About Ben?

28:43.265 --> 28:44.349
Why do you ask?

28:48.187 --> 28:49.229
Sarah.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.233
Must have been some reason you asked that.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.069
I was just asking. Really.

28:58.739 --> 29:00.490
Well, if you think of anything else...

29:27.768 --> 29:30.312
What the hell? Were you following me?

29:30.395 --> 29:31.396
What did you tell them?

29:31.480 --> 29:34.107
None of your business. I'm late for class.

29:42.491 --> 29:44.326
We're no better off
than we were yesterday.

29:44.409 --> 29:46.286
These kids are like mafiosos.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.414
-What's this?
-Just came in.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.502
Leonard Patz.
Indecent A&B on a minor,

29:53.585 --> 29:55.879
lewd and lascivious,
indecent A&B on a minor pending.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.172
He's 36 years old,

29:57.256 --> 29:59.675
lives near the park in that condo,
the Windsor, or whatever they call it.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.301
Why didn't we know about him before?

30:01.385 --> 30:03.136
He moved to Newton in the last year.
Never registered.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.097
One of the ADAs in the child abuse unit
flagged him.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.099
-That's the "pending."
-What did he do?

30:07.182 --> 30:09.518
Grabbed a kid's package
at the public library.

30:09.601 --> 30:11.979
Kid was 15.
Only a year older than Ben Rifkin.

30:12.062 --> 30:14.356
He groped a kid and got out on a personal?

30:14.439 --> 30:17.067
Apparently there was some question
about the kid's testimony.

30:18.402 --> 30:19.778
We should bring him in.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.990
Keep in mind, the Rifkin kid
had no signs of sexual assault.

30:23.073 --> 30:25.534
If we bring this guy in
without something tying him to the case--

30:25.617 --> 30:26.451
Right.

30:27.661 --> 30:28.912
He'll lawyer up.

30:29.454 --> 30:32.124
I know you're under a lot of pressure,
but if you play this wrong,

30:32.207 --> 30:34.293
you could lose
your one chance to talk to him.

30:38.714 --> 30:39.923
Let me sleep on it.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.846
So you're saying
there's been little to no progress?

30:45.929 --> 30:47.306
That's not at all what I'm saying.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.766
Look, everyone in this community
deserves answers.

30:49.850 --> 30:53.729
And Assistant District Attorney Andrew
Barber is pursuing a number of leads.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.857
And I can assure you,
a suspect will be apprehended soon.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.818
That was Middlesex County
District Attorney Lynn--

31:21.590 --> 31:23.008
Isn't that Andy Barber?

31:30.974 --> 31:32.392
The district attorney...

31:34.061 --> 31:35.521
I wonder if he has news.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.318
-Andy.
-Ian, hi.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.153
Man, how fucked up is this?

31:43.237 --> 31:44.154
Very.

31:44.238 --> 31:47.282
So, how's it going with the case?
What do we know so far?

31:49.701 --> 31:52.037
Would you excuse me for one second?
I just have to find my wife.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.873
-Do we have a suspect?
-Sorry. Just--

32:01.713 --> 32:02.714
Toby.

32:06.677 --> 32:09.596
She's over there. Mothering the mothers.

32:12.224 --> 32:14.601
Dylan said they set up
an online community thing.

32:15.185 --> 32:16.603
-Hi, Andy.
-Hi.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.480
Do you know who did this yet?

32:18.564 --> 32:19.815
Any news about the case?

32:19.898 --> 32:21.692
How did the interviews at Archer go?

32:21.775 --> 32:23.485
Sorry, I'm just gonna steal Laurie
for one minute.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.487
-Excuse us, just a second.
-Sure.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.406
What are you doing?

32:27.823 --> 32:29.116
Do you have your car here?

32:29.199 --> 32:32.619
No, I came with Toby.
I figured you'd drive Jacob and me home.

32:32.703 --> 32:34.705
-Jacob's here too?
-Yeah, somewhere.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.957
Okay. Listen, I think I'm gonna go.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.793
-What? You just got here.
-No, I shouldn't have come to begin with.

32:39.877 --> 32:41.545
It was a mistake. Trust me.

32:42.171 --> 32:45.424
Okay. But I think
I need to stay a little longer.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.467
Toby can drive me back.
You can take Jacob with you.

32:47.551 --> 32:48.802
Okay.

32:48.886 --> 32:50.429
-I'll see ya in a while.
-All right.

32:52.431 --> 32:54.183
My mom made me dress up.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.101
Yeah.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.020
Your hair looks so pretty.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.771
Thank you. I wish I had my phone
to take a picture...

32:59.855 --> 33:01.773
Hey. Ready to go?

33:02.232 --> 33:04.401
-Yeah. Sure.
-Did you bring your coat?

33:04.484 --> 33:07.154
Mom put it upstairs with hers.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.656
Okay. I'll find it.
Meet me at the front door.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.005
Andy?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.135
Thought that was you.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.638
Forgive me. I've been hiding out up here.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.056
No, no, it's--

33:35.057 --> 33:36.183
I don't want to intrude. I'm sorry.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.185
No, no, no. Please. Come in. Sit.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.521
Sit.

33:51.865 --> 33:55.202
Any news? Since yesterday, I mean?

33:55.285 --> 33:57.955
We should know more soon.
Everyone's working around the clock.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.710
I always loved his room.

34:05.337 --> 34:09.507
Joan can't bring herself to come in here,
but I can't help it.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.052
I'm in here all the time.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.684
Where you from, Andy?

34:19.101 --> 34:20.435
Me? East Hartford.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.187
-Connecticut, right?
-Yeah.

34:22.980 --> 34:24.438
It's a rough area, isn't it?

34:25.274 --> 34:26.233
Can be.

34:28.318 --> 34:31.864
Joan and I grew up
in a suburb of Baltimore.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.282
High school sweethearts.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.784
It was a town a lot like this one,
to be honest.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.080
Maybe that's why we moved here.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.081
Felt familiar.

34:44.293 --> 34:45.377
Safe.

34:47.337 --> 34:50.174
Boring but safe.

34:57.931 --> 34:59.141
Listen, Dan--

35:05.689 --> 35:07.524
I'm so sorry. I'm...

35:08.525 --> 35:10.152
I'm fuckin' untethered here, man.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.154
Hey. You have every right to be.

35:16.158 --> 35:17.826
The thing I can't get past...

35:19.328 --> 35:21.121
is why did this guy do it?

35:22.998 --> 35:25.918
-Dan, I don't think it's a good idea--
-No. Just, please, please.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.296
Ben was good.

35:32.508 --> 35:33.800
He was so good.

35:34.885 --> 35:36.887
Who could feel that kind of rage
against him?

35:38.805 --> 35:41.808
I mean,
tell me what separates these people?

35:42.935 --> 35:44.061
I wish I knew.

35:52.152 --> 35:54.905
Your son, Jacob--
I've seen him around town.

35:56.573 --> 35:59.952
Seems like a nice boy.
You and Laurie must be really proud.

36:00.661 --> 36:01.662
We are.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.711
There's nothing you wouldn't do for him,
nothing in the world, right?

36:15.592 --> 36:17.094
Yeah. Right.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.779
Hey, come on. We agreed,
no phone when I'm driving.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.281
Makes me feel like a chauffeur.

36:39.116 --> 36:40.117
Sorry.

36:42.035 --> 36:43.245
So you got all your homework done?

36:43.328 --> 36:46.206
Yeah.
Mom made me finish Catcher in the Rye.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.375
Even though it's not due
till, like, next week.

36:48.834 --> 36:49.918
What'd you think?

36:50.836 --> 36:52.796
It was pretty good, I guess.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.800
-You know the deal with his name?
-Who? J.D. Salinger?

36:56.884 --> 36:59.803
No, Holden Caulfield.
The kid from the book.

36:59.887 --> 37:02.097
Ms. Sprung says it's symbolic.

37:02.181 --> 37:06.226
So, like, the name "Holden"
is supposed to be like, "hold in."

37:06.810 --> 37:09.396
And "caul" is another name for a womb.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.816
And "field" is like the field of rye
from the poem.

37:12.900 --> 37:15.652
Huh. Never thought about that.

37:19.239 --> 37:21.116
I don't know.
It's kind of annoying actually.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.036
I feel like all the books she gives us,

37:24.119 --> 37:27.998
they always have these, like,
metaphors and similes and symbols

37:28.081 --> 37:31.502
that you're supposed to figure out,
but it's just, like, who cares?

37:31.585 --> 37:35.088
Just tell the freaking story. Why do you
need all these layers to decode?

37:36.298 --> 37:38.842
Just say what you mean.

37:42.471 --> 37:43.805
You got a point.

37:43.889 --> 37:47.100
Right? I don't know.
It just bugs me.

37:49.061 --> 37:53.106
The book is right about one thing though.
How phony most people are.

37:54.608 --> 37:55.984
I remember that about it.

37:56.693 --> 37:58.445
It's like even tonight.

38:00.447 --> 38:02.491
You thought people
were being phony tonight?

38:02.574 --> 38:04.117
Some. Yeah.

38:04.701 --> 38:05.994
Kids especially.

38:07.829 --> 38:09.289
I'm not saying they're not upset,

38:09.373 --> 38:12.501
but it's like they're acting the way
they think they're supposed to act.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.628
Like they've seen in movies or whatever.

38:14.711 --> 38:16.004
You know what I mean?

38:18.465 --> 38:20.050
Yeah. I do, actually.

38:20.509 --> 38:23.679
And nobody's gonna call them out on it,
'cause then you look like a jerk.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.064
Did you get to eat anything back there?

38:35.607 --> 38:36.692
Just a little.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.989
So the doctor gives him one of those...

38:44.449 --> 38:47.160
It's like a plastic cup with a lid on it.

38:48.036 --> 38:49.913
-Like a canister?
-Yeah.

38:49.997 --> 38:53.208
All right.
So the doctor gives him a canister,

38:53.292 --> 38:55.586
says, "Come back tomorrow
with a semen sample."

38:56.086 --> 39:00.090
-Buddy.
-So the old man, he goes home,

39:00.174 --> 39:02.134
comes back the next day
with an empty canister.

39:02.217 --> 39:04.553
The old man says, "Listen, Doc,

39:04.636 --> 39:07.139
first I tried with my right hand,
and it didn't work.

39:07.222 --> 39:09.641
Then I tried with my left hand,
and it still didn't work.

39:09.725 --> 39:11.685
Then my wife tried it with her right hand,
and it didn't work."

39:11.768 --> 39:12.728
Seriously?

39:12.811 --> 39:14.062
"She tried with her left hand,
didn't work.

39:14.146 --> 39:16.940
So then she called over the neighbor,
the neighbor tried with her right hand,

39:17.024 --> 39:18.442
still didn't work.

39:18.525 --> 39:19.902
Then she tried with her left hand,

39:19.985 --> 39:23.447
but no matter what,
we could not get this damn cap off."

39:28.869 --> 39:29.870
-All right.
-There you go.

39:29.953 --> 39:30.954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39:31.038 --> 39:32.706
-That was good.
-Enjoy.

39:32.789 --> 39:35.709
That was good.
That got me. I didn't see that coming.

40:13.539 --> 40:15.541
I'm exhausted. I'm going up.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.042
-Okay.
-You?

40:17.918 --> 40:18.919
Yeah, a couple minutes.

40:23.507 --> 40:24.716
-Night, honey.
-Night.

40:44.278 --> 40:45.696
Hey, I wake you?

40:47.739 --> 40:49.199
Yeah, pretty much.

40:51.702 --> 40:53.662
Yeah. Yeah, I wanna bring him in.

40:55.455 --> 40:59.209
I am. Okay. Thanks, Duff.
