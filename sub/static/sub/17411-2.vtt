    YOU MAY NOT WANT TO USE
  "PASSWORD" AS YOUR PASSWORD.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.048
   IT'S A LITTLE SIMPLISTIC.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.708
   - THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN
           AROUND ME.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.909
   THE KID HAS NO BOUNDARIES.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.477
   HE LITERALLY CAME THROUGH

03:32.479 --> 03:33.912
     THE WALLS OF MY HOUSE,
             ANDY.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.881
  HOW DOES HE THINK IT'S OKAY
      FOR HIM TO DO THAT?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.883
      - KIDS ARE ANNOYING.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.420
     - THE POINT IS, I NEED
 TO ESTABLISH SOME BOUNDARIES.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.889
   I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING IF
 HE COMES AROUND AND I'M AROUND

03:43.891 --> 03:45.757
      AND HE JUST SHOWS UP
          OR WHATEVER.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.659
           IT'S COOL.
BUT I NEED TO PROTECT WILL TIME.

      I'M GONNA TELL THEM
  THAT I HAVE FOOD POISONING.

    THAT I FORGOT THE TIME.

    WHO JUST MOVED TO TOWN.

     - YOU'LL GET AN ASIAGO
         NEXT THURSDAY.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.285
           YOU KNOW,
    UNTIL LATIN COMES BACK.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.353
        - UM, JUST HAVE
       A FEW SUGGESTIONS

04:48.355 --> 04:50.489
    FOR WHEN YOU AND MARCUS
         ARE TOGETHER.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.058
           UH, IF YOU
    COULD STAY OFF SCREENS,

04:53.060 --> 04:54.359
      THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

04:54.361 --> 04:58.430
   TV, COMPUTER, VIDEO GAMES.

04:58.432 --> 05:02.801
OH, ALSO, IF YOU COULD MAKE SURE
      THAT HE DOESN'T EAT

05:02.803 --> 05:05.937
       MEAT, FISH, FOWL,
    GLUTEN, SUGAR, OR DAIRY.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.706
         - OKAY, WHAT--
        WHAT CAN HE EAT?

05:07.708 --> 05:08.907
    - WELL, EVERYTHING ELSE.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.543
  OF COURSE, IF HE EATS A NUT,
           HE'S DEAD.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.844
            - DEAD?
           <i> DEAD</i> DEAD?

05:12.846 --> 05:14.046
        - CLOSE ENOUGH.
        - CLOSE ENOUGH.

      THE NOMADIC YEARS"?

05:25.025 --> 05:26.425

      A PERIOD OF MY LIFE

05:26.427 --> 05:27.626
         WHEN I DIDN'T
    TAKE A TRADITIONAL JOB.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.628
   I WAS JUST EXPLORING LIFE.
          DO YOU MIND?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.330
    - EXPLORING LIFE. YEAH.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.398
       YOU CAN'T PUT THAT
          ON A RESUME.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.334
   - WHY NOT? I LIVE MY LIFE
     WITH COMPLETE HONESTY.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.802
    I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
        - YOU REALLY DO.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.337
     - IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE
           MY RESUME,

05:38.339 --> 05:40.339
  WHY WOULD THEY HAVE ASKED ME
       FOR AN INTERVIEW?

05:40.341 --> 05:45.077
 CLOSER TO THE WORLD THAT WE'RE
  ALL LIVING IN AND JUST LIE.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.878
         - I DON'T LIE.
        - EVERYONE LIES.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.647
            - NOT I.
   - OKAY, GEORGE WASHINGTON.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.416

06:45.406 --> 06:46.772
           - [laughs]
       - OKAY, 60 BUCKS.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.673

 - YOU KNOW, WILL, I WAS REALLY
    LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS,

07:05.793 --> 07:07.959
 BUT YOU'VE BEEN A GRUMPY PUSS
        THE WHOLE TIME.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.695
   WHY IS HANGING OUT WITH ME
       ANY LESS EXCITING

07:10.697 --> 07:12.964
     THAN HANGING OUT WITH
 THOSE WOMEN WITH BATHING SUITS

07:12.966 --> 07:14.199
    THAT ARE WAY TOO SMALL?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.634
           - ONE DAY,
       YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.802
          - IF YOU'RE
      GONNA BE LIKE THIS,

07:16.804 --> 07:18.670
          WHY DON'T WE
     JUST GO TO THE PARTY?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.005
       - BECAUSE YOUR MOM
         WOULD KILL ME.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.540
            - MY MOM
     DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.142
    - WHAT, SO YOU'RE SAYING
     YOU'D LIE TO YOUR MOM?

07:24.144 --> 07:27.212
  - I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE,
 BUT I'LL DO IT FOR YOU, WILL.

07:27.214 --> 07:31.883
   - I MEAN, IT IS A CHARITY
      AT A SWIMMING POOL.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.552
        FOR ALL WE KNOW,
    THERE'LL BE KIDS THERE.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.488

   OF LITTLE 11-YEAR-OLD KIDS

07:36.490 --> 07:38.457

        AND THE FACT IS,

07:38.459 --> 07:41.059
         WE CAN'T JUST
    SIT IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY

07:41.061 --> 07:42.627

    - YEAH, UH, DALLAS YMCA.
          THAT'S COOL.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.167

             A LOT.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.750
        - WAIT, YOU TWO
        KNOW EACH OTHER?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.452

      WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

12:00.454 --> 12:04.856
 YEAH, SEE, I SAW HIM EARLIER,
  AND AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN,

   UNDER MY WING, RIGHT, BUD?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.493
             - WOW.
    THAT IS SO KIND OF YOU.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.729
      - WELL, TECHNICALLY,
        WE'RE NEIGHBORS,

12:10.731 --> 12:12.731
       BUT I'D SAY WE'RE
 A WHOLE LOT CLOSER THAN THAT.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.933
  WILL AND MY MOM FIGHT A LOT,
    BUT I THINK THAT MAY BE

12:14.935 --> 12:17.936
  BECAUSE OF SOME DEEP-SEATED
       ANIMAL ATTRACTION.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.805
            - WAIT,
     YOU <i> BROUGHT</i> HIM HERE?

     ALWAYS TAKES ME AROUND

12:29.783 --> 12:31.216
       TO CHECK ON WHICH
   HORS D'OEUVRES HAVE NUTS.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.383
  - YOU'RE 11 YEARS OLD, OKAY?

12:32.385 --> 12:33.518
       YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
    TO CHECK YOUR OWN NUTS.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.055
          AND BESIDES,
       I AM TALKING TO...

          YOU GOT IT?
         IT'S BRO CODE.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.506
  WHAT ABOUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
  TO MEET ME AT THE MAIN CAGE

12:54.508 --> 12:56.007
        20 MINUTES AGO?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.509
  ISN'T THAT IN THE BRO CODE?

12:57.511 --> 12:59.844
    I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
 TO THIS PARTY TOGETHER, WILL.

20:15.381 --> 20:19.450
        LIKE EVERY OTHER
     GOOD AMERICAN CITIZEN.

20:22.554 --> 20:27.592
     - IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
         I HAVE A CALL.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.427
          I'M SO SORRY
        ABOUT THE DELAY.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.330
      I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
   OF AN INTENSE NEGOTIATION.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.432
   SORRY. YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR
       ABOUT FIONA BOWA.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.902
       I DON'T EVEN KNOW
        WHERE TO BEGIN.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.971
     BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

20:39.973 --> 20:43.641
        SHE WAS THE WIND
       BENEATH MY WINGS.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.842
      THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.778
    THE AIR RIGHT UNDERNEATH
          THOSE WINGS.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.281
           SHE'S ODD,
        THAT'S FOR SURE.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.452
           - REALLY?
       MY GOD, THANK YOU.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.787
          I GOT A JOB!
          I GOT A JOB!

20:56.789 --> 20:58.456
           I DID IT!
      I DID IT! I DID IT!

20:58.458 --> 20:59.757
         - OH, MY GOD,
        THAT'S AWESOME!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.892
           - I KNOW!
     WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE!

21:01.894 --> 21:05.663
   both: ¶ OPEN UP YOUR MIND
       AND SEE LIKE ME ¶

21:05.665 --> 21:08.432
      ¶ OPEN UP YOUR PLANS
     AND THEN YOU'RE FREE ¶

21:08.434 --> 21:14.038
   ¶ LOOK INTO YOUR HEART AND
 YOU'LL FIND LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ¶

21:14.040 --> 21:15.906
         [drill whirs]

21:15.908 --> 21:20.411
 ¶ WE'RE JUST ONE BIG FAMILY ¶
   [drill continues whirring]

21:22.381 --> 21:24.415
          [dog barks]
