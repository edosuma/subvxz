00:01.201 --> 00:03.681
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.804 --> 00:06.045
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.106 --> 00:08.780
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.583
These are their stories.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.455
Sorry I'm late.

00:15.549 --> 00:19.793
I wanted to find that wine you like, and
I had to go all the way to the bowery.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.396
Al, honey?

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.731 --> 00:31.835
What?

00:32.732 --> 00:33.939
No way.

00:34.801 --> 00:35.802
No way.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.174
(PHONE RINGING)
Pick up. Pick up.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.412
(ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPING)

00:41.475 --> 00:42.613
It's me.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.716
I thought things were really great,

00:46.079 --> 00:49.185
and now I find this typed
letter not even signed?

00:50.317 --> 00:51.625
You have to talk to me, AI.

00:51.685 --> 00:55.827
If this has anything to do with my
parents coming, it's really not okay.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.101
I'm not mad,

00:59.826 --> 01:01.362
I just wanna talk.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.375
Maybe he's just scared of committing.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.969
The way you talk about your dad.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.844
It's not my dad. It's him.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.875
He's got somebody else.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.685
I could just kill him.
If you could find him.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.118
Oh, I'll find him.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.116
Watch this.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.458
Al, this is Leslie again.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.526
You don't call me in the next 12
hours, you're in big trouble.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.931
(SIGHING)
I know what's been going on at school.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.297
Like that ever works.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.268
I gotta go to the gym, see you.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.968
Please, honey,

01:36.663 --> 01:37.903
just call me.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.937
Please.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.755
If you don't have enough money why
don't you put back the vermouth?

01:50.811 --> 01:54.020
You can't make a martini
without vermouth, okay?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.059
How much you need?

01:56.383 --> 01:58.226
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.231
COUNTERMAN: She needs 80 cents.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.859
Here.

02:02.155 --> 02:05.136
If you give me your address,
I'll send you the money.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.804
Forget it.

02:16.436 --> 02:17.847
NEAL: Thanks for letting us in.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.077
I don't know why she didn't
meet us at the airport.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.414
NANCY: Leslie?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.348
Yoo hoo? It's Mom, we're here.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.056
What's this?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.365
NEAL: Leslie?

02:36.890 --> 02:39.803
Her purse and her wallet
and her keys are here.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.230
Please call the police.

02:41.294 --> 02:44.275
Maybe she's visiting somebody in the...
Just call them now. And use your cell.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.072
And don't touch anything.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.419
Missing woman is Leslie Dornan.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.985
Neighbors haven't seen her since yesterday.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.553
She have a boyfriend, girlfriend?

03:39.619 --> 03:41.963
Not according to her folks.
Her father's a cop?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.558
Pittsburgh PD, retired.

03:43.623 --> 03:46.001
Guess he knew which strings to
pull to get Major Case here.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.199
This turns into anything, we'll
put you in on the collar.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.374
Go ahead, impress me.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.477
It's Aramaic.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.415
GOREN: It's the language
that Christ spoke in.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.978
Parts of the Old Testament
were written in it.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.955
But don't ask me what it means.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.825
GOREN: This is Aramaic too.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.266
Mr. and Mrs. Dornan?

04:22.829 --> 04:25.002
Is that your daughter's handwriting?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.709
I don't know. I can't tell.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.347
This wall-hanging here?

04:32.139 --> 04:35.586
My mother brought that back
from Turkey. It's the Lord's Prayer.

04:35.642 --> 04:40.352
But I don't think that
Leslie knew that language.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.560
EAMES: The last time you talked
to her, how did she sound?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.153
NEAL: She sounded fine.

04:45.218 --> 04:49.462
Leslie wouldn't hurt herself.
She loves life, she's a fighter.

04:49.756 --> 04:53.033
The detective said you didn't think
Leslie was involved with anybody.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.231
NANCY: No, she wasn't.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.002
Well, she definitely had a regular visitor.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.673
This is hair gel.

05:06.006 --> 05:10.216
He liked to sit here and watch TV.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.048
He'd rest his head against the wall.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.228
Those are scuff marks.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.703
He liked to put his feet on the table.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.696
Well, he's tall.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.435
Six, 6'4"...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.511
If she had a boyfriend...

05:35.769 --> 05:37.749
Why didn't she tell you?

05:39.439 --> 05:41.612
EAMES: How about you tell us
about her boyfriend?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.178
Al? They broke up last Tuesday.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.520
Leslie came home, his stuff was gone.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.986
She was furious.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.119
She kept leaving messages on his phone,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.992
how she was gonna make trouble for him.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.931
Let's start with Al's full name. Alan what?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.862
It's not Alan. It's Ali Al-Javad.
He's Moroccan.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.870
He's a grad student at Hunter.

06:01.461 --> 06:05.409
Is that why she didn't tell her parents
about him? Because he's Moroccan?

06:06.032 --> 06:08.034
Her dad could be pretty intense.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.039
She must have really liked him.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.014
He made her feel so special.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.150
He bought her expensive gifts, antiques.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.416
I noticed the coffee table.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.854
That was a gift?

06:18.945 --> 06:22.654
Yes. He had me buy that for
her in Amsterdam last summer.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.054
He just gave you a bunch of money

06:27.120 --> 06:28.622
and told you to buy what you want?

06:28.688 --> 06:30.895
No. He gave me the name of the antique store.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.300
They took care of the shipping.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.703
Who picked up the coffee table on this end?

06:34.761 --> 06:36.365
JANEY: We all did.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.042
We took my brother's van to
the customs broker in Jersey.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.611
Just the table. Nothing else?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.376
Yes.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.479
If you're trying to freak
me out, it's working.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.786
(sighing)

06:50.043 --> 06:51.852
How did Al and Leslie meet?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.455
You're embarrassed. Did
he pick her up in a bar

06:57.684 --> 06:59.220
or maybe a chat room?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.759
It's not sleazy.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.296
It's the Singular Singles website.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.064
You can see their video,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.163
hear what they have to say.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.336
It's not like a total pick-up.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.845
I love dancing salsa and singing karaoke.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.644
EAMES: This is the boyfriend, Ali Al-Javad.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.117
My dream girl is a full-figured American lady

07:21.174 --> 07:22.653
who loves to laugh.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.414
Give me some mail.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.683
No, he's not Moroccan.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.747
When Moroccans speak English,
they sound French.

07:27.814 --> 07:29.919
I'd put this guy further east.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.621
How about we put him in this seat?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.028
You talk to his college?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.656
Well, he registered two years ago.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.758
Took a full load the first semester and then

07:36.823 --> 07:38.894
one class each semester after that.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.736
Just enough to satisfy the
requirements of his student visa.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.368
And then he found a girlfriend.
Someone vulnerable,

07:45.432 --> 07:47.105
grateful for the attention.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.477
Somebody who'd be afraid
to ask too many questions.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.174
He moved in with her,

07:51.738 --> 07:52.842
everything's in her name.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.544
He stays off the radar.

07:54.841 --> 07:55.945
He's a sleeper.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.352
(scoffing)

07:57.410 --> 07:59.754
Maybe, just maybe, this
guy doesn't like school.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.349
Maybe he's just here for a good time.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.757
We still have a missing woman.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.093
A 33-year-old single woman who'd
been drinking, who'd been dumped.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.859
I mean... Someone

08:08.989 --> 08:12.129
is trying very hard to convince
us she committed suicide.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.239
This is the translation off the wall
writing. It's from the Old Testament.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.706
The Song of Songs.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.370
"Night after night on my bed,
I have sought my true love.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.709
"I have sought him but not found him.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.806
"I have called him but he has not answered."

08:28.475 --> 08:31.217
They wanted to write a suicide note,

08:31.745 --> 08:34.054
but they couldn't fake her handwriting,

08:34.547 --> 08:36.583
so they wrote it in Aramaic.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.089
Ali took a flight out of Newark
to Germany Tuesday night.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.100
The day before Leslie disappeared.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.864
One of his buddies must
have taken care of her.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.802
He left the country
the same day he left her?

08:48.862 --> 08:51.365
Well, whatever job he had
to do here, it was over.

08:51.431 --> 08:55.345
Look at this itinerary. He had
to connect through Atlanta and Paris.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.645
No. He could have flown direct
from JFK for half the price.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.810
Maybe he was hooking up
with somebody in those cities.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.421
Or maybe it was about leaving out of Newark.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.151
He had something to do in New Jersey
before getting on that plane.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.419
The table.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.291
The table he had Leslie's
friend buy in Amsterdam,

09:11.818 --> 09:14.560
it was shipped to a customs broker in Jersey.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.892
An antique that he could have
bought in SoHo for less money.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.129
It was a dry run.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.263
He was testing the customs inspection.

09:21.327 --> 09:22.635
He brought something else in.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.198
He had to take delivery of it or
maybe hand it off to somebody

09:25.265 --> 09:27.074
before leaving the country.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.175
AUDREY: Tuesday, yes,

09:32.505 --> 09:36.317
Mr. Al-Javad picked up a crate of
household goods from the Netherlands.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.821
Did Customs inspect it?

09:37.877 --> 09:39.117
Inspect?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.453
Oh, the crate?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.484
You're kidding, right?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.591
I guess we are.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.425
How large a crate was it?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.991
Three foot by three foot.
Weight, 80 pounds.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.526
The container the crate was shipped
in, where would that be now?

09:54.594 --> 09:58.337
Ali's crate was loaded in first.
That would put it somewhere in the back.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.811
You know, we get about six million
containers a year coming in,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.546
(DOG BARKING)
and we only check about 2% of them.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.641
The more I know the less I sleep.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.883
This corner here is positive for explosives.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.752
Do you have any idea how much?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.054
Judging by the way Homer's
bouncing around, I'd say a lot.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.594
So much for sleep.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.777
The lab tests from the container
came back positive for Titadine.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.752
It's a high-yield, high-grade
form of dynamite.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.381
Titadine.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.558
There was an advisory
on that stuff last year.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.652
8 tons of it were stolen
from a factory in France.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.155
Most of it's unaccounted for.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.391
Until this morning.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.900
The Feds and the Joint Task Force
are gonna be all over this.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.993
You're not suggesting we bow out.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.372
Hell, no. We've got a
suspected homicide to clear.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.573
Where are we with
Mr. Al-Javad's accomplices?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.804
We found a number of prints
from the rental van.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.709
I like this guy. Jorge Galvez.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.271
His prints were on the inside
of the cargo area of the van.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.375
He's got a juvenile record
in Baltimore. It's gang related.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.852
Then he served three years
here for assaulting a motorist

11:16.910 --> 11:18.253
over a fender bender.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.585
A rageaholic.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.658
Since he was paroled two
years ago, he's been clean.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.859
Not even a parking ticket.

11:25.485 --> 11:29.160
His last year in prison he worked
in the library, he got his GED.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.229
Something put him back
on the straight and narrow.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.034
A religious conversion?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.634
He wouldn't be the first person
to find God behind bars.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.172
Some people find Allah.
Some people find Jesus.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.544
There are a lot of teams in the league.

11:44.637 --> 11:49.552
Galvez finished his parole, but maybe
his PO is still in touch with him.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.583
ABE: Jorge hasn't worked here
since a year ago last spring.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.786
What happened to him?

11:56.849 --> 11:58.954
He went to the hospital. His appendix burst.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.429
After that he disappeared.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.797
His last paycheck I mailed to
his apartment, it got returned.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.335
EAMES: You meet any of his friends?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.235
Just the people from the
prison outreach program.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.139
GOREN: What about his religious friends?

12:12.031 --> 12:16.309
His parole officer told us that he
converted to Islam when he was in prison.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.379
And I can see that you sell halal chicken,

12:21.441 --> 12:24.513
meaning it's slaughtered
according to Muslim tradition.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.825
I know that your community
has had a rough year

12:33.886 --> 12:36.696
and we are not looking
to make things any worse.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.628
There's a missing girl.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.532
Jorge might be involved. We need to find him.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.708
I took him to our mosque, helped him with
his Arabic so he could read the Koran.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.006
Jorge had this big chip on his shoulder.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.516
He'd talk a lot of trash about
America, how oppressed he was.

12:53.573 --> 12:57.180
I told him, you stop breaking the
law, you won't feel so oppressed.

12:57.677 --> 13:01.284
When Jorge went to the
emergency for his appendix,

13:01.848 --> 13:03.828
who took care of him? A girlfriend?

13:03.883 --> 13:06.523
A nurse. He was at Mount Sinai
for over a week.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.623
A week? I like your health coverage.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.792
(scoffing)

13:10.056 --> 13:13.936
Our health coverage is my wife's chicken
soup. We don't cover hospitals.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.998
Somebody had to guarantee that hospital bill.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.646
I just signed the hospital papers.
The prison outreach program

13:22.702 --> 13:25.512
that I was working with at the time,
they had a fund for that sort of thing.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.482
Have you seen Jorge since?

13:27.540 --> 13:30.953
No. Once his parole was up,
we didn't keep in touch.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.787
Excuse me.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.388
(INAUDIBLE)

13:36.449 --> 13:37.894
That's a smart question, Randy.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.395
That's your name, right?

13:39.452 --> 13:42.922
Randy asked why the Greek Bible
is called the Septuagint.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.297
Septua means 70

13:45.858 --> 13:50.500
and the story is that it took 70 scholars
to translate the Hebrew Bible into Greek.

13:51.864 --> 13:56.404
At the great library at Alexandria
in Egypt, right, Mr. Edwards?

13:57.804 --> 13:58.976
Right.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.545
The library and its 700,000
books were destroyed by fire

14:02.608 --> 14:04.281
over 1,300 years ago.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.754
My mother was a librarian.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.790
They just built a new library
on the site of the original.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.593
This time with state of
the art smoke detectors.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.532
You've been?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.701
I've read about it.

14:18.758 --> 14:22.365
I'm one of five people who actually
reads the Smithsonian magazine.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.100
Six.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.900
Yeah, one of six.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.844
I should get back to class.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.381
Substitute teacher.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.245
You must like punishment.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.351
I like making a contribution.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.852
I wish you could make one to our case.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.220
He had an uncle in Baltimore. A dry cleaner.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.921
He was talking about hitting him up for work.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.398
I hope that helps.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.495
Jorge's uncle, the dry cleaner,
died three years ago.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.596
So either Jorge lied to Edwards
or Edwards lied to us.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.163
What's this?

15:30.229 --> 15:33.676
It's the Smithsonian article on
the new library in Alexandria.

15:34.467 --> 15:38.347
When Edwards mentioned smoke
detectors, it didn't ring a bell.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.782
You actually read this when it came out?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.780
The magazine's the perfect
size for my treadmill.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.756
There's nothing in here
about smoke detectors.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.823
And since there's no reason Edwards
would mention a detail like that...

15:49.882 --> 15:52.055
He's been to Egypt in the last year.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.487
The State Department would know.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.799
The Egyptian consulate in
Munich issued a tourist visa

15:58.858 --> 16:01.134
to Ethan Edwards a year ago last June.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.435
A week later, they issued
another one to Jorge Galvez.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.476
They both got passports in April last year.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.568
They both left the country in the same week,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.408
and they both got back two months ago.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.210
Sounds like they had a meeting of the minds.

16:11.270 --> 16:15.150
Edwards' co-workers, at the outreach
program, they knew he was a Muslim,

16:15.675 --> 16:18.588
but he didn't become political
until he met Jorge Galvez.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.351
The school board have an address on Edwards?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.983
Just a PO box.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.255
I'll get Carver working on a
subpoena for the postal records.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.160
You two call the task force.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.762
- Bedroom clear!
- Bathroom clear!

16:33.259 --> 16:34.897
MAN: Living room clear!

16:38.264 --> 16:39.937
(SIREN WAILING)

16:55.848 --> 16:57.418
This is not good.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.189
It's rat poison.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.599
Rat poison's an anticoagulant.

17:05.625 --> 17:10.074
Suicide bombers in Israel, they
use it to mix with the shrapnel

17:10.195 --> 17:11.607
when making bombs.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.410
The idea is

17:14.599 --> 17:18.173
when their victims are wounded,
they bleed to death.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.848
A suicide bomber.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.377
When the hell did this kid decide

17:23.442 --> 17:25.944
that's what he wanted to be when he grows up?

17:26.012 --> 17:28.515
Doesn't look like he's planning to grow up.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.294
EAMES: This is the crate
they shipped from overseas.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.491
The K-9 unit came up positive for explosives.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.832
Once we get all this weighed, we'll know
how much Titadine we have to worry about.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.962
Edwards lived here alone
until a couple of weeks ago,

17:41.027 --> 17:43.940
another man described as male, Hispanic.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.200
Galvez.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.743
EAMES: We couldn't get a positive ID.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.336
At this point, we're not sure which
one's the actual suicide bomber.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.881
It could be a suicide bomber,

17:50.937 --> 17:52.974
or they might try and use
a remote-controlled device.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.383
Well, I'm going with a suicide bomber.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.478
You see here, here and here.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.825
Something was taped to the wall.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.385
The paint was ripped off
when it was taken down.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.423
And duct tape residue.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.731
The sheet was used as a backdrop.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.434
And...

18:19.365 --> 18:21.538
These three marks.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.114
Probably a tripod.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.607
I think they made a

18:28.240 --> 18:29.617
video tape.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.548
A suicide note.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.720
The Bureau feels releasing any information
to the public is counterproductive.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.822
It might even provoke these people
to step up their operation.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.094
They already know we got their scent.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.668
We weighed that crate, they
have 50 pounds of Titadine,

18:47.927 --> 18:49.702
they made a vest, they're good to go.

18:49.762 --> 18:53.369
Agent O'Dell, it's established
practice to let the eyes and ears

18:53.432 --> 18:56.743
of the American public help us
deal with terrorist threats.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.382
For once we have more to offer
them than a color scheme.

18:59.438 --> 19:02.385
We have the actual photos of the terrorists

19:03.042 --> 19:07.684
which the District Attorney will
recommend be released to the media.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.761
I'll let my people know that.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.401
We're still tracking down Galvez's
associates and relatives here

19:17.456 --> 19:18.560
and in Baltimore.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.399
We got some background on Edwards,

19:20.459 --> 19:22.336
he might have family up in Westchester.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.534
Which one is the designated martyr?

19:25.064 --> 19:28.841
Galvez took electronics courses in prison.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.910
He probably assembled the bomb.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.417
Which leaves Edwards the job of carrying it.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.817
What are his qualifications?

19:37.276 --> 19:40.348
Theology major at Manhattan
University with a minor in languages.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.884
He speaks Spanish, Arabic, working
knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.226
Everything you'd need to study
the Bible in the original text.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.289
He volunteers in soup kitchens.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.303
He mentored kids in inner city schools.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.703
How can a man with that background
murder innocent people?

19:57.463 --> 20:00.774
Well, that's probably why he
made a tape. To explain himself.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.744
We can always ask his parents.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.549
JOE: it's because of his religious beliefs,

20:08.607 --> 20:09.779
that's why you singled him out.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.981
Mr. Edwards, will you please
just answer my question?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.285
He called last July. He was in Phoenix.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.587
He'd just gotten back from
traveling around Europe.

20:16.649 --> 20:20.062
And Egypt. He got a visa for Egypt last year.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.857
Yes, he visited Egypt.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.195
Why aren't you telling us
anything? Is Ethan hurt?

20:25.257 --> 20:27.294
We spoke to Ethan three days ago.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.898
GOREN: He's working as a
substitute teacher in Queens.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.039
Did you know that's what he was doing?

20:33.099 --> 20:36.842
No. If Ethan wanted us to know he
was here, he would've told us.

20:39.271 --> 20:42.844
Mr. Edwards, I need you to
unlock the door to the garage.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.113
(DOG BARKING)

20:49.882 --> 20:51.486
This woman is missing.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.062
Leslie Dornan.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.497
Maybe Ethan

20:57.256 --> 20:59.133
knows what happened to her.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.394
Is she his girlfriend?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.461
No.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.804
It's complicated.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.001
Ethan would never hurt anyone.
He's a very ethical person.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.640
Well, he's certainly familiar
with the Ten Commandments.

21:11.871 --> 21:15.683
He's got the Torah, the Koran, the Bible

21:15.941 --> 21:18.046
with notes written in the margins.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.386
He followed a path of study.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.021
He probably would've been a minister
if it weren't for his father.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.325
Your husband doesn't like religion?

21:30.523 --> 21:33.003
Joe's a chemist. He likes tangible things.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.501
And Ethan embraced the intangible.

21:41.567 --> 21:45.037
Have you ever talked to him
about his conversion to Islam?

21:47.606 --> 21:49.882
He said it made him feel

21:49.942 --> 21:52.855
centered and connected
to something bigger than him.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.691
When was this picture taken?

21:59.718 --> 22:02.995
That's the summer I took Ethan to
do volunteer work in Appalachia.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.432
He was just ten.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.035
Did your husband take that picture?

22:07.092 --> 22:09.368
No. Joe didn't go with us.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.773
It wasn't a good time in your marriage?

22:20.206 --> 22:22.982
Maybe it brought you and Ethan closer.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.616
When Ethan was traveling,

22:25.678 --> 22:28.750
maybe he contacted you
more than your husband.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.124
He sent me e-mails. He called me once,

22:31.750 --> 22:33.286
after the attacks.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.059
I wasn't sure where he was.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.236
Did he talk about the attacks?

22:42.228 --> 22:45.072
He wanted to know if anyone
we knew had been hurt.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.705
He sounded very shaky.
He wanted to come home,

22:48.767 --> 22:51.714
but he said he had things he had to do first.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.821
You're probably the one person
that he's afraid to disappoint.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.488
Oh, he knows that couldn't happen.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.491
You said that Ethan was

23:01.547 --> 23:04.721
looking for a connection to
something bigger than himself.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.361
Now, if he found people
that offered that connection,

23:10.489 --> 23:12.730
he might be persuaded to do things

23:13.058 --> 23:15.402
that he found morally repugnant.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.972
What things?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.706
A suicide bombing.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.369
Oh, my God, no.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.641
Oh, Ethan.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.876
You can help us bring him in.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.381
As we reported earlier, Vera Edwards,

23:34.446 --> 23:37.950
the mother of fugitive terrorist
suspect Ethan Edwards,

23:38.050 --> 23:39.893
Suffered a massive heart attack

23:39.952 --> 23:44.025
after being informed that her son might
be a member of a terrorist cell.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.729
A spokesperson for St. Peters hospital

23:46.792 --> 23:50.865
says that Mrs. Edwards remains
in very critical condition.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.170
In fact...

23:52.564 --> 23:56.102
We're monitoring the hospital, the
parents' house, phones, e-mails.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.375
In the hopes he'll reach out
to his dying mother?

23:58.437 --> 24:02.010
CARVER: Detective Goren feels that
she's a role model for Edwards.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.145
They've got something.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.917
You raised me

24:06.845 --> 24:10.520
to believe you can't take
without giving back.

24:11.417 --> 24:14.398
So really, this is a path
I was always meant to walk.

24:16.021 --> 24:19.230
Tell everyone that there's a message coming,

24:21.126 --> 24:23.299
and America better read it carefully

24:24.396 --> 24:27.639
because it's being written
in a language it understands.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.868
(BEEPS)

24:28.934 --> 24:30.413
It was e-mailed to his parents.

24:30.469 --> 24:34.007
It's clean, nothing embedded, no
way to trace where it came from.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.448
This is a streaming video, right?

24:38.644 --> 24:41.887
Like the videos on Singular Singles?

24:43.615 --> 24:47.654
The software to process
and send a streaming video,

24:48.420 --> 24:49.694
are they all the same?

24:49.755 --> 24:51.701
No. There are different kinds.

24:55.060 --> 24:59.975
And each one would have
a signature on the video?

25:00.799 --> 25:02.210
Sure. Why?

25:05.738 --> 25:07.308
Hello, I'm Khalid.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.210
I'm a stock analyst with an MBA
from Wharton School of Business.

25:11.276 --> 25:12.721
I enjoy sports...

25:12.778 --> 25:14.689
This is the only video
I found on Singular Singles

25:14.747 --> 25:17.956
that uses the same software
as the Edwards video.

25:20.085 --> 25:23.692
I like romantic dinners and long
walks in the city at night.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.134
Let's give him his long walk.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.035
Get his phone number and
address from the website.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.866
I got pizza.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.448
(DOOR RATTLING)

25:44.610 --> 25:45.953
Police!

25:49.715 --> 25:51.524
Get him down, get him down!

25:54.620 --> 25:56.395
He was gonna kill Edwards.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.259
GOREN: Keep Edwards from talking.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.767
Talk about what? We got the bomb.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.006
One of the bombs.

26:10.469 --> 26:14.281
This vest weighs about 40 pounds

26:14.506 --> 26:16.315
and minus the shrapnel.

26:16.575 --> 26:20.022
We've only got about 20,
25 pounds of explosives here.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.961
There's another vest out there.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.691
EAMES: Our search of Khalid's
place didn't turn up any leads

26:31.757 --> 26:34.135
to Jorge or to what their target might be.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.366
These items were in Ethan's knapsack.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.907
We're not sure what this is.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.170
"1/55@31 ."

26:40.532 --> 26:42.705
It doesn't correspond to any address.

26:42.768 --> 26:46.341
The Bureau is assuming Galvez and Edwards
were planning a coordinated attack.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.009
The first man detonates in a crowd.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.178
The second man waits for
rescue personnel to arrive

26:50.242 --> 26:52.552
or targets the crowd
fleeing the first explosion.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.386
All we need is when and where.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.689
Well, they'd pick a confined space
to maximize the concussive power

26:57.749 --> 26:59.660
of the shock waves bouncing off the walls.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.994
If we assume Galvez sticks to the plan.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.226
DEAKINS: Do we have a choice?

27:03.288 --> 27:05.666
The task force turned up
an e-ticket in Khalid's name

27:05.724 --> 27:08.102
for a flight out of JFK
to Madrid tomorrow night.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.198
If this follows the MO, it means his
part of the job would be over by then.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.869
Which puts the target date for the
operation within days from now.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.411
Step into him fast.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.481
You're an American citizen,
Ethan. Born and raised.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.021
Free to worship in
a religion of your choice.

27:27.446 --> 27:31.258
How can you sit there and let
Jorge kill innocent Americans?

27:34.019 --> 27:37.228
Well, maybe what they say is true,

27:39.124 --> 27:40.626
you're a traitor.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.035
The worst kind of scum.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.005
No, I'm not a traitor.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.439
One nation under God.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.713
My allegiance is to God, to Allah.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.908
Killing in the name of God is good?

27:53.772 --> 27:56.082
It's better to kill in the name of oil?

27:56.241 --> 27:58.118
I don't get it, Ethan.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.056
Your family told us you were upset by 9/11.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.487
It was a mistake.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.126
It was too much.

28:06.084 --> 28:09.691
But then America sent gun ships and
killed hundreds of innocent people,

28:09.755 --> 28:11.393
women, children.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.533
9/11 was a terrible lesson
that no one learned.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.331
So we need what? A refresher course?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.569
Look, I'm sure that he has it all worked out.

28:20.632 --> 28:24.978
Anyway, this is all,
you know, big-picture stuff.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.719
My partner and I, we're here
for the little picture.

28:29.775 --> 28:31.686
For Leslie Dornan.

28:31.743 --> 28:34.053
Her parents just wanna bury her.

28:37.816 --> 28:41.059
You know, it just occurred to me that
you haven't asked about your mom.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.099
You don't wanna know how she is?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.066
How is she?

28:46.124 --> 28:48.195
EAMES: We're working on the
barter system here, Ethan.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.900
You give us something, we give you something.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.577
You're afraid.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.514
No, you're afraid that
you're gonna fail this test.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.521
That those other guys were right.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.955
Who?

29:08.013 --> 29:09.686
What are you talking about?

29:09.748 --> 29:13.321
Well, the reason why
Khalid tried to kill you.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.127
To protect the operation. I accept that.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.958
He knew it.

29:19.024 --> 29:22.870
And the other guys at the
training camp, they knew it, too.

29:26.131 --> 29:30.841
Ethan, when it comes right down to
it, this is really not your fight.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.646
I mean, you don't have centuries of injustice

29:35.907 --> 29:39.047
and colonial oppression
to harden your resolve.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.252
I'm a Muslim.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.750
It's my fight, too.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.792
You know,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.958
I read the Koran a long time ago.

29:52.257 --> 29:55.295
When I was in the army,
I was stationed in Germany.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.240
And there was this girl who lived
near the base, she was Turkish.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.835
She was Muslim. I wanted to impress her.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.972
And you know, it's really
not what you'd expect.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.343
For example,

30:10.375 --> 30:14.517
they recognize the right for women to
vote, to own and inherit property.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.993
To divorce their husbands.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.764
And this was written what?
Like 1,300 years ago.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.299
It's the true word of God.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.768
Well, you would know. You've
been looking for the true word.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.466
You've been searching for God.

30:34.633 --> 30:39.082
But there's one thing
that I couldn't find in here.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.682
And that's the part where

30:41.807 --> 30:44.617
Allah, you know, tells
everybody to just go ahead

30:44.676 --> 30:47.418
and indiscriminately kill innocent people.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.426
I mean, that part, that's not in here.
I mean, where is that?

30:50.482 --> 30:52.792
Must be in some secret chapter.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.924
But it isn't because I didn't
miss it, did I, Ethan?

30:59.825 --> 31:01.998
I mean, it's exactly what
my Muslim friends told me

31:02.060 --> 31:04.336
is that it's not in the Koran.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.539
That there's no sanction for
what you were planning to do

31:10.268 --> 31:13.181
and what Jorge still plans to do.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.115
No, we weren't...

31:18.677 --> 31:20.987
You weren't what?

31:28.453 --> 31:30.558
Let me show you something.

31:36.495 --> 31:40.307
This x-ray is of a suicide
bomb victim in Israel.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.607
This victim has no external
injuries, no shrapnel wounds.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.008
Just this white mass.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.588
Emergency room doctors
call this the white butterfly.

31:53.645 --> 31:57.787
It's what the heart and lungs
and other internal organs

31:59.751 --> 32:03.028
look like after they've been turned into soup

32:03.388 --> 32:05.664
by the concussion from the bomb.

32:10.462 --> 32:14.069
Ethan, what I want to know is
you went searching for God,

32:14.499 --> 32:17.173
how did you end up looking for targets?

32:21.373 --> 32:23.319
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:26.244 --> 32:28.815
That's probably news about your mother.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.621
Oh, by the way,

32:32.984 --> 32:35.260
this x-ray is of a five-year-old girl.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.673
I was sent by God.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.137
So are we.

32:52.504 --> 32:53.676
(door shuts)

32:53.872 --> 32:55.977
We have to consider another option.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.543
Sodium Amytal.

32:57.609 --> 32:58.644
Truth serum?

32:58.710 --> 33:01.748
I've seen it used on Soviet
defectors, and it didn't work.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.987
If we inject him, we'll lose his
trust, and it'll waste time.

33:05.050 --> 33:08.361
Ethan is a difficult subject, and we
have nothing to leverage him with.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.263
We have his sense of morality.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.633
His sense of morality is what
got us here in the first place.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.633
The FBI has access to it, doesn't it?

33:16.895 --> 33:20.035
I'm not getting squat without
authorization from Justice.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.270
The new FBI.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.922
Well, isn't that what the President said?

33:34.112 --> 33:36.524
You're either with us or against us?

33:37.182 --> 33:41.289
He sees the world in high
contrast. It's black and white.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.967
Our way or the highway.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.669
ETHAN: He has no idea what we sound
like to the rest of the world.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.002
Washington's still making up its mind.

33:51.496 --> 33:52.634
Progress?

33:54.132 --> 33:56.237
So, you gonna lead us out of our ignorance?

33:56.301 --> 33:57.780
I just want America

33:58.003 --> 34:00.779
and the West to stop trying
to control the destiny

34:00.839 --> 34:03.319
of my Muslim brothers and sisters.

34:03.675 --> 34:04.915
Surgery?

34:09.313 --> 34:11.123
So, you think by blowing yourself up

34:11.181 --> 34:13.219
is a step in the right direction?

34:13.284 --> 34:16.891
Martyrdom has a lot of symbolic value.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.568
Buddhist monks set themselves on fire

34:19.623 --> 34:21.934
to protest their religious persecution.

34:22.594 --> 34:26.268
A man did it at the Pentagon in the
'60s to protest the Vietnam war.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.637
And they were understood loud and clear

34:28.699 --> 34:30.839
because they didn't muddy it
up by killing other people.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.815
You ever think about that
instead of a suicide bomb?

34:39.311 --> 34:43.282
Well, I'm sure things made a
lot more sense six months ago.

34:43.514 --> 34:44.960
You know, they were much clearer...

34:45.016 --> 34:46.290
I'm just tired.

34:47.552 --> 34:49.293
GOREN: No, no, no, no, no.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.466
You had doubts

34:53.091 --> 34:55.331
long before you ran into us.

34:56.761 --> 35:01.176
About how all this killing squares
up with the will of a merciful God.

35:01.232 --> 35:02.973
Of course I had doubts.

35:03.401 --> 35:04.937
I'm not a psychopath.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.084
Well, you had more than doubts.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.088
You knew you were lost.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.759
GOREN: "Night after night on my bed,

35:22.120 --> 35:23.724
"I sought my true love.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.597
"I sought him but not found him.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.306
"I call him but he does not answer."

35:36.968 --> 35:39.744
In the trade we call this a tell, Ethan.

35:40.171 --> 35:44.347
You didn't write the verse
on Leslie's wall by mistake.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.948
You wrote it 'cause you were
calling out to God,

35:49.014 --> 35:51.153
and he's not answering.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.563
And you haven't felt this lost

35:55.854 --> 36:00.064
since that summer you went to
Appalachia when your parents separated.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.164
And that is your personal struggle,

36:05.230 --> 36:06.800
your jihad,

36:07.232 --> 36:11.408
to find connection to something
bigger than yourself.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.783
And nothing's bigger than God.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.386
And the moment you realized
you lost connection with him

36:22.013 --> 36:25.517
was when you were watching
Jorge kill Leslie.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.796
It wasn't supposed to happen.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.530
He was just gonna talk to her.

36:47.439 --> 36:51.910
So if Leslie had to die
to protect your mission

36:53.311 --> 36:56.383
then maybe there was something
wrong with your mission.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.159
Something unjust.

37:04.589 --> 37:07.126
And that's what was going through your head.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.131
I wouldn't kill innocent civilians.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.971
EAMES: Well, Leslie's dead.

37:13.498 --> 37:17.412
And more innocent people will
die if Jorge sets off his bomb.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.283
There's only one way back to God.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.422
There's only one way to make
your parents understand

37:28.480 --> 37:31.552
that you're not about this or this.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.330
If I tell you where she is, what do I get?

37:47.599 --> 37:49.977
We'll tell you how your mother's doing.

37:54.672 --> 37:56.845
I'll write down the address.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.981
If you tell us where Jorge is,

38:05.683 --> 38:07.685
how we can stop him,

38:08.419 --> 38:11.059
we might let you know where your mother is.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.033
Whatever happens is God's will.

38:30.909 --> 38:34.379
EAMES: I hope this doesn't turn
out to be the consolation prize.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.790
GOREN: These hairs
under Leslie's fingernails.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.063
- Yeah.
- Blond hairs,

38:43.121 --> 38:45.601
short, razor cut, black roots.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.897
Jorge's gone blond.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.869
I have shoe prints here.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.739
Boots.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.437
Anyone do boots?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.714
(CAMERA CLICKING)

39:01.072 --> 39:02.813
What do you think, military issue?

39:02.874 --> 39:05.081
Regular army, mid '90s. Brand new.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.248
Probably came from a surplus store.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.081
He's got a crew cut.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.159
He may be wearing military...

39:13.218 --> 39:14.561
Clothing.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.630
Ethan said they wouldn't kill civilians.

39:18.756 --> 39:20.201
Civilians.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.067
Tomorrow's Veteran's Day.

39:24.696 --> 39:29.202
The Veteran's Day parade down Fifth Avenue.
That's a two mile long target.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.847
The note we found from Ethan's backpack,

39:33.905 --> 39:37.853
1/55, first of the 55th.
That's the mechanized infantry battalion.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.585
And 31

39:40.645 --> 39:44.388
could be 31st street, their
muster point for the parade.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.718
Why that battalion?

39:48.586 --> 39:51.999
First of the 55th were deployed to the Gulf.

39:55.426 --> 39:58.669
These are Desert Storm veterans.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.703
Authorities are still seeking
information on the whereabouts

40:04.769 --> 40:08.774
of suspected terrorists Ethan
Edwards and Jorge Galvez.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.375
Police are investigating reports

40:10.441 --> 40:12.751
that Galvez was spotted
in his native Baltimore.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.518
Other sources tell us authorities now believe

40:15.580 --> 40:18.390
the suspects may have fled the country.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.826
In other news...

40:36.167 --> 40:38.147
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

41:16.808 --> 41:20.483
We have a possible ID. East of
Madison, south side of the street.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.691
Hey. Desert Storm, right?

41:28.753 --> 41:30.562
I can tell by your uniform.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.834
I was 171st Armor.

41:32.890 --> 41:36.667
You were with the 55th mechanized division.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.010
GOREN: You got your ID?

41:42.066 --> 41:44.637
You know, they're checking IDs.

41:48.806 --> 41:50.149
You wanna smoke?

41:51.642 --> 41:55.055
You know, I quit seven years ago,
but being back in the uniform

41:55.413 --> 41:58.087
really plays a trip on my head.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.036
You got a light?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.816
EAMES: Police! Clear! Out of the way!

42:31.949 --> 42:33.656
(GOREN SCREAMING)

42:42.760 --> 42:44.296
(gun firing)

42:57.141 --> 42:59.849
MAN: Get those people back.
Mark the perimeter.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.295
God's will.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.155
Let's hope so.
