00:57.864 --> 01:00.465
Come on, Buddy!
Let the girl go!

01:06.706 --> 01:10.008
You got nowhere to go.
Come on.

01:27.827 --> 01:29.128
This all of it?

01:29.129 --> 01:33.198
Yep. It didn't come.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.601
- It smells good.
- I hope it's not burned.

01:35.602 --> 01:39.037
- This tastes like shit, mom.
- Really, Joel?

01:39.039 --> 01:40.106
Nice hair, by the way.

01:40.107 --> 01:41.507
You like it?

01:41.508 --> 01:43.309
- Not really.
- I like it.

01:43.310 --> 01:45.777
Thank you.

01:45.779 --> 01:47.046
Yeah.

01:47.047 --> 01:49.114
That looks nice.

01:50.916 --> 01:52.651
That looks nice.

01:52.652 --> 01:54.620
All right. I got to go.

01:54.621 --> 01:57.522
I'll see you guys later.
Come on.

01:57.524 --> 01:58.958
Remember tomorrow.

01:58.959 --> 02:00.559
I already told you.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.560
We got band practice.

02:03.463 --> 02:05.097
He just sat down.

02:05.098 --> 02:07.298
You think they're doing it?

02:07.300 --> 02:08.366
Dad!

02:08.368 --> 02:09.602
I'm sorry.

02:09.603 --> 02:13.404
You didn't come from a stork.

02:13.406 --> 02:14.740
Carol called.

02:14.741 --> 02:16.741
Yeah?

02:17.310 --> 02:18.644
Did you send her the check?

02:18.645 --> 02:20.546
Not yet.

02:20.547 --> 02:22.947
Well, she's just gonna
keep calling.

02:22.949 --> 02:26.050
I know.

02:27.286 --> 02:29.188
Don't worry about Carol.
I'll send the check, okay?

02:29.189 --> 02:30.656
Okay.

02:30.657 --> 02:32.158
I will take care of her.

02:32.159 --> 02:36.427
All right.

02:36.429 --> 02:42.033
About sunday, Sue and
I have this thing planned.

02:42.035 --> 02:44.103
I'd like a little
bit more warning.

02:44.104 --> 02:49.040
Mom would really
like to see you.

02:49.042 --> 02:51.042
I can't cancel.

02:51.044 --> 02:53.044
Sorry.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.948
Great.

02:56.950 --> 02:59.617
Well, guess what.

02:59.619 --> 03:02.620
I guess it's just me
and you and grandma

03:02.622 --> 03:05.456
and her famous pumpkin pie.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.393
- Yummy.
- Come on.

03:07.394 --> 03:08.794
You know you love that.

03:08.795 --> 03:12.297
You can show her your Snowflake.

03:12.299 --> 03:16.601
In fact, you want to show
me your Snowflake?

03:16.603 --> 03:18.470
Snowflake.

03:18.471 --> 03:19.805
Come on. Snowflake!

03:19.806 --> 03:21.640
Come on! Just show us.

03:21.641 --> 03:22.741
She's been really
good with her Snowflake.

03:22.742 --> 03:24.276
Come on.

03:24.277 --> 03:26.778
Okay, fine.

03:44.164 --> 03:45.631
It's cute!

03:45.632 --> 03:46.632
Come here.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.200
Isn't that cute?

03:48.201 --> 03:49.401
That was great.

03:49.402 --> 03:52.804
You're gonna miss Snowflake.

03:56.308 --> 04:00.612
This is...

04:00.614 --> 04:03.581
46 times 9.

04:05.518 --> 04:06.819
That's 414.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.454
Don't try to confuse me.

04:08.455 --> 04:09.722
Jesus.

04:09.723 --> 04:11.290
I didn't take anything.

04:11.291 --> 04:12.191
Then why's my drawer short?

04:12.192 --> 04:15.226
I don't know. It's
not my problem.

04:15.228 --> 04:16.661
You're unbelievable.

04:16.663 --> 04:17.997
You know what?

04:17.998 --> 04:19.498
I can't work for you
anymore, all right?

04:19.499 --> 04:21.499
Can I just have my money?

04:29.575 --> 04:30.809
40 bucks?

04:30.810 --> 04:34.112
Are you serious?

04:34.114 --> 04:37.148
You're an asshole.

04:39.051 --> 04:40.252
That went well.

04:40.253 --> 04:44.389
Yeah, well, have sticky
fingers, get underpaid.

04:44.391 --> 04:46.858
We made a cool $121 today.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.527
Fall's always slow.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.930
I don't want you to come
out of pocket or anything,

04:51.931 --> 04:54.365
but I can't work for free, man.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.367
It's gonna pick up.

04:55.368 --> 04:56.568
Okay?

04:56.569 --> 04:57.770
After the new year,
it will pick up.

04:57.771 --> 04:59.138
All right.

04:59.139 --> 05:04.008
Hey. I'm here for a pick-up.

05:10.115 --> 05:13.584
Can I help you?

05:13.586 --> 05:15.387
Troy?

05:15.388 --> 05:17.622
Hey, Buddy.

05:17.624 --> 05:20.258
This is, my brother Troy.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.393
Troy, Ryan.

05:21.394 --> 05:22.628
Hey.

05:22.629 --> 05:25.663
I was actually on my way out.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.268
Wow.

05:29.269 --> 05:31.269
I got your message.

05:31.271 --> 05:32.871
Which one?

05:32.872 --> 05:35.239
That's real funny.

05:35.241 --> 05:38.276
You know things are
crazy at the agency.

05:39.412 --> 05:40.412
Busy's good.

05:40.413 --> 05:41.513
Busy is good.

05:41.514 --> 05:42.614
You look good.

05:42.615 --> 05:44.249
You look good, Buddy.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.250
How long has it been?

05:48.187 --> 05:50.254
Seven months.

05:50.256 --> 05:51.457
I'm proud of you.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.891
Well, don't be.

05:53.893 --> 05:56.461
Everything's gone to shit.

05:56.463 --> 05:57.863
Well, this is a piece
of shit business.

05:57.864 --> 06:01.866
What do you expect?

06:01.868 --> 06:06.003
We all can't work in fashion.

06:06.005 --> 06:07.906
I should have
never quit the band.

06:07.907 --> 06:11.075
I know. Are you still playing?

06:11.077 --> 06:12.244
Not really.

06:12.245 --> 06:13.946
I'm waiting on Duncan.

06:13.947 --> 06:16.781
Well, that'd be good.

06:16.783 --> 06:18.783
How's Billy?

06:18.785 --> 06:19.985
Billy's good.

06:19.986 --> 06:22.286
Except for his name's Bobby.

06:22.288 --> 06:24.288
How are the rugrats?

06:25.125 --> 06:27.458
Joel's a punk.

06:27.460 --> 06:29.560
Molly's still an angel.

06:29.562 --> 06:33.231
What's up?

06:38.303 --> 06:39.271
I don't know.

06:39.272 --> 06:41.306
I didn't want to
ask you this, man.

06:41.307 --> 06:43.307
But...

06:44.277 --> 06:49.614
I'm broke and...

06:49.616 --> 06:51.616
How much you need?

06:52.285 --> 06:54.720
I didn't want to go to the
bank 'cause I have a loan

06:54.721 --> 06:56.954
and the mortgage.

06:56.956 --> 06:58.657
And I didn't want to...

06:58.658 --> 07:00.992
How much do you need?

07:03.029 --> 07:04.363
$12,000.

07:04.364 --> 07:06.397
$12,000.

07:16.275 --> 07:19.677
Don't slip.

07:19.679 --> 07:20.979
I won't.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.848
As soon as I can pay
you back, I will.

07:22.849 --> 07:24.783
I know you will, but
you don't have to.

07:24.784 --> 07:25.884
I'm serious.

07:25.885 --> 07:27.853
I'm serious, too.

07:27.854 --> 07:30.022
Don't you go down
that road again, Buddy.

07:30.023 --> 07:32.824
Do you understand me?

07:32.826 --> 07:35.293
I won't.

07:38.965 --> 07:42.834
I haven't seen you in a while.

07:42.836 --> 07:43.902
I'm gonna play
some pool tonight.

07:43.903 --> 07:47.305
You want to come with me?

07:47.307 --> 07:51.108
Nah, I got to work.

07:51.110 --> 07:54.879
Mom's having a dinner tomorrow.

07:54.881 --> 07:56.715
It'd be nice to see you.

07:56.716 --> 07:58.650
Is she really, now?

07:58.651 --> 08:00.819
You should come by, bring
your boyfriend, Bobby.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.387
That would be
great, wouldn't it?

08:02.388 --> 08:03.589
I bring my new boyfriend.

08:03.590 --> 08:07.091
Boy, mom would just
love that, wouldn't she?

08:07.093 --> 08:09.193
She would like to see you.

08:09.195 --> 08:11.096
Buddy, do you know
how long it's been

08:11.097 --> 08:12.531
since she and I have talked?

08:12.532 --> 08:15.433
Just come by.

08:15.435 --> 08:19.637
Just come.

08:20.739 --> 08:21.773
Okay.

08:21.774 --> 08:25.209
I'll come by tomorrow night.

08:35.354 --> 08:37.788
Buddy, you can complain
all you want,

08:37.789 --> 08:39.291
but there's no worse headache

08:39.292 --> 08:42.326
than trying to teach
french to fourth graders.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.430
Yeah, well, trust
me. One's enough.

08:45.431 --> 08:47.599
Yeah, but Molly's such
a sweetheart, you know?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.202
I mean, she's not like
those other shithead kids.

08:50.203 --> 08:53.971
Yeah.

08:53.973 --> 08:56.908
Is everything all
right with you?

08:58.378 --> 09:01.012
No.

09:01.014 --> 09:03.981
My cleaners is failing.

09:03.983 --> 09:05.817
I owe that bitch money.

09:05.818 --> 09:08.553
I told you that was a mistake.

09:09.789 --> 09:10.789
I know.

09:10.790 --> 09:12.790
She's calling Eve now.

09:12.926 --> 09:14.593
Is she calling you about money?

09:14.594 --> 09:16.594
- Yep.
- Yeah.

09:16.596 --> 09:18.063
So, are you guys okay?

09:18.064 --> 09:19.531
Are you guys good?

09:19.532 --> 09:21.433
Sometimes I think we are,

09:21.434 --> 09:25.870
and other times I think we're
just in other countries.

09:25.872 --> 09:27.872
Did she say anything to you?

09:29.142 --> 09:31.009
The only thing she said to me

09:31.010 --> 09:34.445
was that you forgot
to notice her new hair.

09:34.447 --> 09:36.281
Really?

09:36.282 --> 09:38.316
Great.

09:45.959 --> 09:47.125
You want me to
help you with that?

09:47.126 --> 09:48.327
No, no. I got it.

09:48.328 --> 09:49.194
All right.

09:49.195 --> 09:51.596
So, is he still with that man?

09:51.598 --> 09:53.598
I believe so.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.568
I don't get it.

09:56.569 --> 09:57.769
Well, he's gay, mom.

09:57.770 --> 09:59.004
He likes men.

09:59.005 --> 10:00.739
Are you sure that
they're coming?

10:00.740 --> 10:02.740
That's what he said.

10:03.242 --> 10:06.811
He's always so busy with
whatever it is he does.

10:06.813 --> 10:09.648
Speaking of busy, I mean,
when are you gonna stop all this

10:09.649 --> 10:10.916
with your sewing, your cooking?

10:10.917 --> 10:12.818
I mean, I'm worried about you.

10:12.819 --> 10:13.919
Well, I'm fine.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.487
You still on your medicine?

10:15.488 --> 10:18.022
Enough with the questions.

10:18.024 --> 10:19.091
What about you?

10:19.092 --> 10:21.592
What's her face's excuse?

10:21.594 --> 10:23.395
You know her name.

10:23.396 --> 10:25.396
Trouble.

10:25.832 --> 10:27.165
Hey! Troy's here!

10:27.166 --> 10:28.800
Hey. How you doing?

10:28.801 --> 10:30.769
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.771
- Thank you for coming.
- You remember Bobby, right?

10:32.772 --> 10:33.872
- Hello.
- Hey, Bud.

10:33.873 --> 10:34.873
How are you, man?
Good to see you.

10:34.874 --> 10:35.874
- Hello.
- Hi, Bobby.

10:35.875 --> 10:36.942
Hi, mom. How are you?

10:36.943 --> 10:38.943
Hi.

10:40.612 --> 10:42.547
So, mom, how's your
sewing business?

10:42.548 --> 10:44.449
Well, if somebody
visited more...

10:44.450 --> 10:47.985
It's just fine. Thanks
for asking, Troy.

10:47.987 --> 10:49.221
See, what I'm doing here,

10:49.222 --> 10:50.489
you see that I'm expressing

10:50.490 --> 10:51.723
a little bit of concern
for mother.

10:51.724 --> 10:53.225
Do you see that?

10:53.226 --> 10:56.328
I'm so glad you could squeeze
me in your schedule.

10:56.329 --> 10:58.163
Well, I'm here. Aren't I?

10:58.164 --> 10:59.531
I like seeing you.

10:59.532 --> 11:00.832
I know you do.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.268
That's why Bobby and I
drove three and a half hours

11:03.269 --> 11:04.002
to get here.

11:04.003 --> 11:06.003
Okay.

11:08.241 --> 11:10.608
Well, let's keep
this party going.

11:10.610 --> 11:12.611
I'm ready to drink a little
bit. How about you, Buddy?

11:12.612 --> 11:14.579
You want a little? A little nip?

11:14.580 --> 11:16.214
I'm good without.

11:16.215 --> 11:18.549
I'm just messing with you.

11:23.956 --> 11:25.357
Well, how about the band?

11:25.358 --> 11:27.159
You were mentioning
something the other day

11:27.160 --> 11:29.528
that you were gonna be
back in the band again.

11:29.529 --> 11:31.496
I don't know.

11:31.497 --> 11:34.965
I mean, Duncan said his
guitarist is in rehab

11:34.967 --> 11:37.168
and, there's a slight chance

11:37.170 --> 11:39.570
that he's gonna
be out for awhile.

11:39.572 --> 11:42.707
And there's a possibility
I could sit in.

11:42.709 --> 11:43.742
That's good.

11:43.743 --> 11:45.743
Why don't you play for us?

11:46.779 --> 11:48.846
With what?

11:48.848 --> 11:50.248
With your guitar.

11:50.249 --> 11:52.884
I saw one right over
there when we walked in.

11:52.885 --> 11:54.052
Yes.

11:54.053 --> 11:55.320
It's beat up.

11:55.321 --> 11:56.588
- It's fine.
- Come on.

11:56.589 --> 11:58.256
Come on. I told Bobby
how good you are.

11:58.257 --> 12:00.826
He was really talking about
you the whole way over here.

12:00.827 --> 12:03.994
Come on.

12:03.996 --> 12:07.998
- Come on.
- Come on.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.735
- All right.
- All right.

12:10.737 --> 12:12.537
All right. Yeah.

12:12.538 --> 12:14.538
Yeah.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.110
Yeah.

12:18.111 --> 12:20.778
Man, this thing is...

12:20.780 --> 12:24.342
Hurry up, Buddy, before I drink
the whole bottle of wine.

13:06.692 --> 13:08.226
God damn, Buddy.

13:08.227 --> 13:09.961
You still got it.

13:09.962 --> 13:12.329
That was really good, Buddy.

13:12.331 --> 13:14.865
I got to tell you something.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.568
I'm not the only performer here.

13:17.570 --> 13:19.538
Really?

13:19.539 --> 13:21.939
Is there somebody else?

13:23.042 --> 13:26.043
Somebody has a play coming up!

13:26.045 --> 13:27.546
That's so exciting, honey.

13:27.547 --> 13:28.747
Come on.

13:28.748 --> 13:30.615
- Sing something for us, Molly.
- Show grandma.

13:30.616 --> 13:32.551
You want to show mom
your Snowflake?

13:32.552 --> 13:35.019
Yeah, come on.
Show grandma.

13:35.021 --> 13:37.121
Show grandma your Snowflake.

13:49.869 --> 13:52.136
That was fantastic!

13:52.138 --> 13:54.005
That was good.

13:54.006 --> 13:56.006
That's it?

14:03.515 --> 14:05.515
Yeah.

14:11.256 --> 14:14.758
Don't worry, honey.
You were great.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.228
You were great.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.800
Honey, why
don't you go inside?

14:21.801 --> 14:24.468
I want to talk to
Uncle Troy, okay?

14:24.470 --> 14:25.804
- Honey.
- What?

14:25.805 --> 14:28.906
Why don't you go inside?

14:37.049 --> 14:39.250
You know, Bobby, he's kind of...

14:39.252 --> 14:41.952
Immature? Rude?

14:41.954 --> 14:43.688
Yeah, pretty much.

14:43.689 --> 14:47.258
Little fucking... little bitch.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.593
I'm telling you, man.

14:48.594 --> 14:50.996
In the sack, that boy's
ass is so tight.

14:50.997 --> 14:55.099
You stick a quarter up there,
he'll grind it down to a dime.

14:55.101 --> 14:57.534
I don't want to hear that shit.

14:57.536 --> 14:58.904
Okay?

14:58.905 --> 15:01.740
You have sex with who you
have sex with. That's fine.

15:01.741 --> 15:06.243
But I don't need to know the
inside of their anal track.

15:06.245 --> 15:07.879
I'm worried about mom.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.481
Mom's mom.

15:09.482 --> 15:13.083
No, mom's 72, and
she's still working.

15:13.085 --> 15:14.786
She doesn't
take a dime from me.

15:14.787 --> 15:16.021
You ever try?

15:16.022 --> 15:17.989
I have. I've tried.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.224
Bullshit.

15:19.225 --> 15:20.825
She doesn't take
anything from me.

15:20.826 --> 15:21.626
When have you tried?

15:21.627 --> 15:24.662
You know how
she was with dad.

15:27.866 --> 15:29.867
How's that fucker?

15:29.869 --> 15:30.969
Son of a bitch.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.604
I don't know.

15:33.606 --> 15:37.207
I haven't seen him
in like three years.

15:37.209 --> 15:38.643
Three years.

15:38.644 --> 15:40.045
Fuck.

15:40.046 --> 15:41.479
I'd give my left testicle

15:41.480 --> 15:43.281
to have had a conversation
with him in three years.

15:43.282 --> 15:44.849
He hasn't talked
to me in nine years.

15:44.850 --> 15:46.618
I know we don't see
each other that much.

15:46.619 --> 15:48.153
We don't kind of
really get along.

15:48.154 --> 15:52.423
But, it's nice
that you came out.

15:52.425 --> 15:55.092
Mom's happy to see you.

15:55.094 --> 15:58.562
You ain't exactly living on
fucking welfare, you know?

15:58.564 --> 16:01.231
So maybe you could
toss her a few bucks.

16:01.233 --> 16:04.301
I'll consider it.

16:04.303 --> 16:07.338
Thanks.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.377
You playing a
game on that thing?

16:13.379 --> 16:15.946
Nope.

16:15.948 --> 16:18.148
What are you doing?

16:18.150 --> 16:20.150
Texting Beth.

16:21.153 --> 16:22.721
What's she up to?

16:22.722 --> 16:25.022
Mommy was helping her.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.226
Mommy's at Beth's?

16:29.228 --> 16:31.428
Yep.

16:41.106 --> 16:43.440
How's Sue?

16:43.442 --> 16:46.110
She's good.

16:46.112 --> 16:48.013
What'd you guys do?

16:48.014 --> 16:49.748
Just girl stuff.

16:49.749 --> 16:51.349
That's it?

16:51.350 --> 16:53.884
Yep, that's it.

17:02.060 --> 17:05.929
I love you.

17:05.931 --> 17:09.433
I love you, too.

17:14.406 --> 17:17.473
Saturday, me and
Troy are going to,

17:17.476 --> 17:19.510
catch up and shoot some pool.

17:19.512 --> 17:23.213
That's cool.

17:23.214 --> 17:27.885
So, if you wanted to have
a girls' night or whatever...

17:27.887 --> 17:31.488
Yeah. Maybe.

17:45.070 --> 17:47.605
Dude, why are you
smoking that girly shit?

17:47.606 --> 17:51.675
I mean, I'm supposed to, you
know, like, quit one vice.

17:51.677 --> 17:53.311
An electric cigarette?

17:53.312 --> 17:54.546
- Yeah.
- Really?

17:54.547 --> 17:56.081
Dude, I need something
with a kick.

17:56.082 --> 17:58.083
Can you imagine listening
to your frickin' daughter

17:58.084 --> 18:00.285
screeching this fucking music
all day long for this musical

18:00.286 --> 18:04.221
<i>and trying to combat it
with an electric cigarette?</i>

18:04.223 --> 18:05.757
No way.

18:05.758 --> 18:08.826
I need something
with more of a kick.

18:08.828 --> 18:10.828
Electric weed.

18:11.097 --> 18:12.864
That's what I'm talking about.

18:12.865 --> 18:14.932
That's not part of the program.

18:14.934 --> 18:16.801
Electric cocaine.
Electric cocaine.

18:16.802 --> 18:18.670
That's definitely not
part of the program.

18:18.671 --> 18:20.038
Fuck the program!

18:20.039 --> 18:21.039
Wh... Shit.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.006
Here come your kids.

18:22.007 --> 18:23.708
- Yo, later. Bye.
- See you, bro.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.510
Hey!

18:25.511 --> 18:27.412
There's my little Beyoncé.

18:27.413 --> 18:28.680
Hi, Beth.

18:28.681 --> 18:29.781
Hey, Mr. Hutchins.

18:29.782 --> 18:31.516
- How are you?
- Good.

18:31.517 --> 18:33.517
- How was rehearsal?
- Good.

18:37.155 --> 18:39.023
Hey, Don.

18:39.024 --> 18:40.024
Hey, Buddy.

18:40.025 --> 18:41.226
What you been up to?

18:41.227 --> 18:42.227
You know, man.

18:42.228 --> 18:44.428
Just busy working.

18:44.430 --> 18:47.764
You working?

18:47.766 --> 18:50.067
Put in some overtime?

18:50.069 --> 18:52.069
Yeah. Yeah.

18:53.005 --> 18:55.506
What do you mean, man?

18:59.011 --> 19:01.745
See you around.

19:01.747 --> 19:04.181
Yeah.

19:04.183 --> 19:05.817
So, let's head home, all right?

19:05.818 --> 19:07.818
Okay.

19:15.561 --> 19:17.561
When's Troy coming down?

19:17.563 --> 19:19.264
I'm going up there.

19:19.265 --> 19:20.365
Really?

19:20.366 --> 19:22.366
Yep.

19:24.169 --> 19:25.703
See you tomorrow.

19:25.704 --> 19:27.605
Tell him I said hi.

19:27.606 --> 19:29.606
I will.

20:08.446 --> 20:10.447
I'll see you soon, okay?

20:10.449 --> 20:11.983
- Okay.
- Promise?

20:11.984 --> 20:13.885
You fucking bitch.
You motherfucker.

20:13.886 --> 20:15.353
You're fucking me wife?

20:15.354 --> 20:16.421
- Buddy.
- Shut up!

20:16.422 --> 20:17.855
- Hey!
- Shut the fuck up!

20:17.856 --> 20:18.656
Stop it.

20:18.657 --> 20:19.924
Shut the fuck up.

20:19.925 --> 20:22.226
- Fuck... Fuck...
- Buddy, stop it!

20:22.228 --> 20:23.228
Fuck you, you hooker.

20:23.229 --> 20:24.329
I'm out of here.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.430
You know what?
I've had enough.

20:25.431 --> 20:26.564
You're out of here?

20:26.565 --> 20:27.765
Yeah, why don't you fucking go?

20:27.766 --> 20:30.078
- Stop it!
- Why don't you fucking go?

20:31.337 --> 20:33.304
He threw the first punch.
I mean, he's crazy.

20:33.305 --> 20:34.606
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:34.607 --> 20:36.541
And what's you're
relationship to him?

20:36.542 --> 20:37.809
That's my husband.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.077
He's the father of my kids.

20:39.078 --> 20:40.612
- Okay.
- He's been drinking.

20:40.613 --> 20:41.779
And the other guy is...?

20:41.780 --> 20:43.248
The guy I'm seeing.

20:43.249 --> 20:44.249
Okay.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.283
Evelyn.

20:45.284 --> 20:47.284
Did he touch you?

20:48.454 --> 20:49.754
You shouldn't get up so fast.

20:49.755 --> 20:51.256
How could you do this to me?

20:51.257 --> 20:53.624
How could you do this to me?

20:53.626 --> 20:54.759
Things haven't been the same.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.893
Where is that fucking midget?

20:56.895 --> 20:59.130
- How long has this been going on?
- Excuse me, Mr. Hutchins...

20:59.131 --> 21:00.632
- How long?!
- Buddy, calm down.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.033
- You fucking slut!
- Hey, Mr. Hutchins.

21:02.034 --> 21:03.601
- See, I told you.
- Relax, okay?

21:03.602 --> 21:05.103
You told him what?
What did you tell him?

21:05.104 --> 21:06.838
Look, aybe it's best
you stay somewhere else

21:06.839 --> 21:08.339
- for the night.
- This is my house.

21:08.340 --> 21:09.974
Okay, but you need to
take some time to cool off.

21:09.975 --> 21:11.175
- I am cool.
- I don't think so.

21:11.176 --> 21:12.043
Where's my child?

21:12.044 --> 21:13.311
- Where's my baby?
- Buddy, stop it.

21:13.312 --> 21:14.712
- We're gonna go.
- Get off me!

21:14.713 --> 21:16.047
Let's go. You have the
right to remain silent.

21:16.048 --> 21:18.082
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

21:18.083 --> 21:19.117
in a court of law.

21:19.118 --> 21:20.351
You have the right
to an attorney.

21:20.352 --> 21:21.786
If you can't afford one,

21:21.787 --> 21:24.599
one will be appointed
to you, free of charge.

21:26.759 --> 21:29.693
Come on. You got
to be kidding me.

21:29.695 --> 21:31.229
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shut up.

21:31.230 --> 21:35.565
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.567
Come on.

21:40.372 --> 21:43.140
Mom?

21:43.142 --> 21:44.609
Mom, what are you doing?

21:44.610 --> 21:46.077
Evelyn called me.

21:46.078 --> 21:47.011
God, ma.

21:47.012 --> 21:49.413
Ma, you don't have any money.

21:49.415 --> 21:51.082
But I love you.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.250
God.

21:52.251 --> 21:54.652
You should have just
let me stay in there.

21:54.653 --> 21:56.621
- I need my fucking dress.
- Lady, calm down.

21:56.622 --> 21:57.855
This is illegal!

21:57.856 --> 22:00.158
You can't just prevent
me from getting it.

22:00.159 --> 22:02.060
Lady, listen to me. Calm down!

22:02.061 --> 22:04.128
I'll sue. I'll call the
better business bureau.

22:04.129 --> 22:07.064
Listen come on. Come on.

22:07.066 --> 22:08.666
You'll get your fucking dress.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.001
Yeah, I better get
my fucking dress.

22:10.002 --> 22:11.102
Dude, where were you, man?

22:11.103 --> 22:12.337
- Long story.
- Jesus Christ!

22:12.338 --> 22:13.338
Open the fucking door.

22:13.339 --> 22:15.405
Let's fucking go.

22:15.407 --> 22:19.142
Just calm down. Jesus Christ.

22:19.144 --> 22:20.611
Give me my dress.

22:20.612 --> 22:21.813
Here. Sorry!

22:21.814 --> 22:23.814
It's about time.

22:24.683 --> 22:28.318
Jesus Christ, you
look like shit.

22:29.521 --> 22:30.521
Rough night.

22:30.522 --> 22:31.656
I can see.

22:31.657 --> 22:33.157
I'm fine.

22:33.158 --> 22:34.959
Look, I'm not even gonna
ask you about all this, man.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.862
But, dude, if you can't
pay me, I can't work here.

22:37.863 --> 22:39.330
What do you expect me to do?

22:39.331 --> 22:42.432
Okay, after the holidays,
we're gonna pick up.

22:42.434 --> 22:44.068
We'll be right on track, okay?

22:44.069 --> 22:45.703
Dude, I took another job.

22:45.704 --> 22:46.904
What?

22:46.905 --> 22:48.539
Dude, this business
is failing, man.

22:48.540 --> 22:51.809
And, matter of fact, you just
need to cut your loses, man.

22:51.810 --> 22:55.979
This business is all I have.

22:58.316 --> 23:01.184
Dude, you owe me $700.

23:01.186 --> 23:04.187
You're gonna get your
money. I promise.

23:05.391 --> 23:07.824
Yeah.

23:07.826 --> 23:09.826
I'll see you around, dude.

23:11.195 --> 23:14.364
Come on.

23:24.876 --> 23:26.744
Buddy, what are
you doing here?

23:26.745 --> 23:28.646
I came to get a few things.

23:28.647 --> 23:29.881
What do you need?

23:29.882 --> 23:31.616
What, you're not
gonna let me in?

23:31.617 --> 23:33.384
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

23:33.385 --> 23:34.385
Shut up. Let me in.

23:34.386 --> 23:37.020
No, I can't.

23:37.022 --> 23:38.623
What is wrong with you?

23:38.624 --> 23:42.559
I tried to make us a happy
family for us, for Molly.

23:42.561 --> 23:43.761
You have two children, Buddy.

23:43.762 --> 23:45.296
Yeah, well, Joel hates me.

23:45.297 --> 23:47.265
Yeah, that's because you
became a fucking monster.

23:47.266 --> 23:50.834
I became sober. Now
let me in, please.

23:50.836 --> 23:53.170
I'm gonna bring
your stuff out here.

23:55.406 --> 23:57.341
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:57.342 --> 23:59.476
No.

23:59.478 --> 24:01.012
Okay.

24:01.013 --> 24:05.282
Then I want my guitar and
I want my clothes right now.

24:05.284 --> 24:06.617
Wait right here.

24:06.618 --> 24:08.919
Don't move.

24:13.291 --> 24:14.659
- Molly, go to your...
- Molly!

24:14.660 --> 24:16.660
Hi, honey.

24:19.564 --> 24:23.200
What a fucking bitch.

24:35.746 --> 24:38.982
It's from my attorney.

24:51.562 --> 24:52.697
No.

24:52.698 --> 24:54.265
No, no, no.

24:54.266 --> 24:55.366
Molly is mine.

24:55.367 --> 24:57.835
You can have Joel, but
Molly stays with me.

24:57.836 --> 24:59.003
I'm sorry, Buddy.

24:59.004 --> 25:00.505
What? The house?

25:00.506 --> 25:01.706
You want the fuck...

25:01.707 --> 25:03.907
This is my fucking house!

25:03.909 --> 25:06.443
I guess I'll see you in court.

25:06.445 --> 25:09.346
Yeah, you better fucking
believe you will.

25:19.123 --> 25:20.625
No. She didn't.

25:20.626 --> 25:21.826
No, no, no.

25:21.827 --> 25:23.828
Yo, Buddy.
Where the hell you been?

25:23.829 --> 25:25.029
It's Matty D.

25:25.030 --> 25:26.898
I tried your phone.

25:26.899 --> 25:28.899
Get back to me.

25:30.302 --> 25:31.769
No.

25:31.770 --> 25:33.237
No.

25:33.238 --> 25:34.305
No.

25:34.306 --> 25:35.773
My...

25:35.774 --> 25:39.309
What is wrong with you?!

25:39.311 --> 25:41.311
Fuck!

25:51.289 --> 25:52.423
Ma.

25:52.424 --> 25:53.558
What's wrong?

25:53.559 --> 25:55.226
- Everything.
- What?

25:55.227 --> 25:58.528
She wants everything...
the kids, the house, all of it.

25:58.530 --> 26:00.398
Well, you know my
feelings about her.

26:00.399 --> 26:01.799
Mom, please.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.267
Well, what are you gonna do?

26:03.268 --> 26:04.936
I'm not gonna let her take
Molly. That's for sure.

26:04.937 --> 26:07.070
And this. Look at this.

26:07.072 --> 26:10.073
She hid this from
me for two weeks.

26:10.075 --> 26:12.709
It makes me sick.

26:12.711 --> 26:14.978
Well, why don't you call now?

26:14.980 --> 26:17.247
I called three times already.

26:17.249 --> 26:20.450
I can't mom, it's
been two weeks.

26:20.452 --> 26:22.452
It can't hurt.

26:30.528 --> 26:31.796
It's voicemail.

26:31.797 --> 26:33.797
Leave a message.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.900
Come on, mom.

26:38.604 --> 26:40.004
Come on.

26:40.005 --> 26:41.005
Hey, Dunky.

26:41.006 --> 26:42.673
Hey, it's me, Buddy.

26:42.674 --> 26:43.808
Listen,

26:43.809 --> 26:45.309
I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you.

26:45.310 --> 26:47.011
I had a little,
couple crazy weeks.

26:47.012 --> 26:48.679
But, I'd really like
to hear from you

26:48.680 --> 26:50.615
and I'd love to rock out
with you guys again.

26:50.616 --> 26:52.783
So, please, call me back
when you get a chance.

26:52.784 --> 26:54.752
Okay, thanks.

26:54.753 --> 26:56.920
Well, you never know.

27:01.759 --> 27:04.494
$10,000?

27:04.496 --> 27:05.696
$10,000?!

27:05.697 --> 27:08.132
Well, I wasn't gonna
let you rot in there.

27:08.133 --> 27:09.700
How are we gonna pay this?

27:09.701 --> 27:10.835
Don't worry.

27:10.836 --> 27:12.236
But we don't have any money!

27:12.237 --> 27:13.504
Buddy, don't worry.

27:13.505 --> 27:15.006
My God. I'll sell the cleaners.

27:15.007 --> 27:16.240
Buddy. Buddy!

27:16.241 --> 27:18.708
It's the only
thing we have left.

27:26.218 --> 27:28.652
We convene today
to mediate the case

27:28.654 --> 27:31.988
of the state of California
versus Buddy Hutchins.

27:31.990 --> 27:33.391
Evelyn, can you please describe

27:33.392 --> 27:35.326
your martial status
with Mr. Hutchins?

27:35.327 --> 27:37.927
Well, Buddy's never been around.

27:37.929 --> 27:40.363
He's not been
there for the kids.

27:40.365 --> 27:43.400
He's also had a
drinking problem.

27:43.402 --> 27:45.302
So, you feel that
you can sustain

27:45.303 --> 27:48.005
sole responsibility for
both of your children, then?

27:48.006 --> 27:49.774
Yes. Absolutely.

27:49.775 --> 27:51.208
With my job as a teacher,

27:51.209 --> 27:54.078
I feel like I can support
both of my children.

27:54.079 --> 27:58.515
Buddy's cleaners is failing.

27:58.517 --> 28:02.118
Yes. I'm confident I
can support my children.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.621
She cheated on me.

28:03.622 --> 28:05.923
The marriage failed
because she was unfaithful.

28:05.924 --> 28:08.993
Your allegations of infidelity
are unsubstantiated.

28:08.994 --> 28:11.095
Moreover, they're
not the issue here.

28:11.096 --> 28:13.663
She cheated!

28:13.665 --> 28:15.832
Mr. Hutchins, please.

28:15.834 --> 28:19.136
For the record, tell the court
about your last marriage.

28:19.137 --> 28:21.439
Was that
dissolution also not your fault?

28:21.440 --> 28:24.474
Carol's crazy.
She's an alcoholic.

28:24.476 --> 28:26.010
Yes, well.

28:26.011 --> 28:28.079
I'm sorry, but the court
did not see it your way.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.714
Well, sometimes
courts can rule poorly.

28:30.716 --> 28:34.284
Now, speaking of poorly,
how much do you pay ostensibly

28:34.286 --> 28:36.853
this crazy woman
alimony per month?

28:36.855 --> 28:38.855
$200.

28:39.791 --> 28:41.225
And for the court's record,

28:41.226 --> 28:44.101
have you paid last month's
or are you overdue?

28:47.199 --> 28:48.799
I love my dad.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.268
Have you ever noticed any strange,
disturbing behavior?

28:52.270 --> 28:56.072
I don't understand.

28:56.074 --> 28:57.475
I'll rephrase.

28:57.476 --> 29:01.745
Has your dad, in your
opinion, ever acted odd?

29:01.747 --> 29:04.080
Odd as in strangely abnormal.

29:04.082 --> 29:06.783
No.

29:06.785 --> 29:10.353
Joel, tell me about your father
this time last year.

29:10.355 --> 29:13.123
He's gotten a lot
better since then.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.426
Please define
"better" for the court.

29:15.427 --> 29:19.496
Well, every night, he would come
home from work and drink.

29:19.498 --> 29:22.032
And what would happen
when he was intoxicated?

29:22.033 --> 29:24.734
He would yell at
me, yell at mom,

29:24.736 --> 29:27.004
pass out in front
of the TV with a beer

29:27.005 --> 29:29.380
and usually spill
it all over himself.

29:30.508 --> 29:32.942
Thank you.

29:32.944 --> 29:36.412
Buddy's the most loving
father in the world.

29:36.414 --> 29:39.315
All he ever talks
about are his kids.

29:39.317 --> 29:43.186
Mrs. Hutchins, was your husband
not an alcoholic himself?

29:43.188 --> 29:45.388
He had his problems.

29:45.390 --> 29:48.424
Would you call your son
an alcoholic, then?

29:48.426 --> 29:51.461
He hasn't a drink
in almost a year.

29:51.463 --> 29:55.465
Would you call someone
sent by the court order

29:55.467 --> 30:00.069
to A.A. Twice and convicted
of four D.U.I.S an alcoholic?

30:00.071 --> 30:03.207
Mr. Styles, this question
calls for subjective opinion.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.675
It's already on record

30:04.676 --> 30:08.211
that Mr. Hutchins has four
misdemeanor convictions

30:08.213 --> 30:09.914
for drug and alcohol abuse.

30:09.915 --> 30:12.082
Let me rephrase broadly,
then, your honor.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.819
When Mr. Hutchins was driving
drunk almost a year ago

30:14.820 --> 30:18.521
on may 6th with his wife
and children in the car,

30:18.523 --> 30:20.224
three times over
the legal limit,

30:20.225 --> 30:21.725
and smashed into
a concrete wall,

30:21.726 --> 30:23.761
would anyone contest
that he was unfit to care

30:23.762 --> 30:28.998
for a 7 year old
child then or now?

30:30.535 --> 30:33.136
I hereby award
Ms. Evelyn Hutchins

30:33.138 --> 30:35.505
full custody to
the subject minors.

30:35.507 --> 30:38.608
As for financial responsibilities,
Mr. Hutchins,

30:38.610 --> 30:43.146
I hereby order you to pay
$300 a month in child support.

30:43.148 --> 30:45.148
Case closed.

30:52.523 --> 30:54.725
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

30:54.726 --> 30:56.926
- My God.
- Are you open, bro?

30:56.928 --> 30:57.928
What?

30:57.929 --> 31:00.663
I got to pick up a tux.

31:00.665 --> 31:02.233
Useless.

31:02.234 --> 31:03.734
Buddy?

31:03.735 --> 31:04.768
Jesus Christ.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.370
Buddy.

31:06.371 --> 31:07.738
You look like shit.

31:07.739 --> 31:09.173
Well, it's nice to
see you, too, Carol.

31:09.174 --> 31:10.741
Well, I call and I call.

31:10.742 --> 31:12.743
Can't you see that
things aren't well?

31:12.744 --> 31:14.044
Sorry to hear that.

31:14.045 --> 31:15.613
Sup?

31:15.614 --> 31:17.414
This your pimp?

31:17.415 --> 31:18.415
This is Ricky.

31:18.416 --> 31:20.050
He's taking care of me now.

31:20.051 --> 31:21.252
Meaning?

31:21.253 --> 31:23.053
You know why I'm here.

31:23.054 --> 31:24.455
I know.

31:24.456 --> 31:26.290
Well, it's been two months.

31:26.291 --> 31:27.658
One month, Carol.

31:27.659 --> 31:30.260
Two months today.
You owe me $400, Buddy.

31:30.262 --> 31:31.962
You'll get your damn
money, all right?

31:31.963 --> 31:33.797
Watch your mouth, white boy.

31:33.798 --> 31:34.598
Excuse me?

31:34.599 --> 31:36.233
Watch your fucking mouth.

31:36.234 --> 31:37.301
What's his problem?

31:37.302 --> 31:38.869
He's got a lot of problems.

31:38.870 --> 31:40.371
Are you fucking retarded?

31:40.372 --> 31:42.606
Do you not see there's a
big red lock on the door?

31:42.607 --> 31:44.475
My God. What's your problem?

31:44.476 --> 31:46.176
You don't need to get all huffy.

31:46.177 --> 31:47.745
I heard about Evelyn.

31:47.746 --> 31:49.280
Yeah. So what?

31:49.281 --> 31:51.015
Do you have anything for me?

31:51.016 --> 31:52.283
You want something?

31:52.284 --> 31:53.284
Here, Carol.

31:53.285 --> 31:54.285
Here you go.

31:54.286 --> 31:55.753
Take it. Take it.

31:55.754 --> 31:57.154
This isn't enough.

31:57.155 --> 31:59.089
I will get you more soon.

31:59.090 --> 32:00.391
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

32:00.392 --> 32:01.926
You being real disrespectful
right now.

32:01.927 --> 32:03.961
And I'm gonna need
you to pay my girl.

32:03.962 --> 32:07.730
I need till friday.

32:07.732 --> 32:08.532
Fine.

32:08.533 --> 32:10.401
We'll give you till friday.

32:10.402 --> 32:12.002
But I'm gonna see you.

32:12.003 --> 32:13.203
Come on, baby.

32:13.204 --> 32:15.305
- Bye, Buddy.
- I'm gonna see you.

32:15.307 --> 32:16.941
I'm Ricky rich, bitch.

32:16.942 --> 32:18.942
Let's go.

32:42.067 --> 32:44.600
You got one day.

33:09.493 --> 33:11.061
I'm sorry about the cleaners.

33:11.062 --> 33:12.329
Yeah.

33:12.330 --> 33:15.398
I'll be back in
a couple of hours.

33:18.502 --> 33:22.572
So, I heard they locked
you out of the cleaners.

33:22.574 --> 33:26.409
Yeah, that's just temporary.

33:26.411 --> 33:29.479
Mom's been seeing Don.

33:29.481 --> 33:32.015
Good for her.

33:32.017 --> 33:34.717
You don't look too good.

33:35.753 --> 33:38.322
Well, things haven't
really been peachy, now,

33:38.323 --> 33:39.823
have they, Joel?

33:39.824 --> 33:43.026
Well, that's what you get
for being an alcoholic.

33:43.028 --> 33:44.561
Joel.

33:44.562 --> 33:47.597
I'm not an alcoholic.

33:47.599 --> 33:48.866
Really?

33:48.867 --> 33:52.402
That's why your wife is
fucking your best friend?

33:52.404 --> 33:53.537
What did you just say to me?

33:53.538 --> 33:55.838
- Shut up, Joel!
- You shut up!

33:55.840 --> 33:57.474
Look what you did
to this family.

33:57.475 --> 33:59.243
- This is all your fault.
- Joel, please.

33:59.244 --> 34:01.244
You're the worst dad ever.

34:01.246 --> 34:03.780
Joel, stop being so mean to dad!

34:03.782 --> 34:05.649
You ruined this whole family.

34:05.650 --> 34:07.117
And now you want to
have dinner with me?

34:07.118 --> 34:09.618
No. This is bullshit.
Come on. Let's go.

34:10.821 --> 34:14.290
For what it's worth,
I'm really, really sorry.

34:14.292 --> 34:17.060
You still coming to my show?

34:17.062 --> 34:18.896
Yes, I wouldn't miss
it for the world, baby.

34:18.897 --> 34:19.996
I wouldn't.

34:19.998 --> 34:23.199
Are you ever coming back?
I miss you.

34:23.201 --> 34:24.935
I miss you, too, sweetie.

34:24.936 --> 34:27.603
I do. I miss you very much.

35:05.944 --> 35:07.944
Fuck, man.

35:11.449 --> 35:15.017
Why did you have
to fucking leave?

35:15.019 --> 35:18.254
Where'd you go?

35:37.909 --> 35:39.109
Goddamn it.

35:39.110 --> 35:41.110
It's Buddy again.

35:42.614 --> 35:44.248
What do you want?

35:44.249 --> 35:46.649
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

35:46.651 --> 35:48.485
Get the fuck out of my house.

35:48.486 --> 35:50.154
What do you want, Buddy?

35:50.155 --> 35:51.488
Put Molly on the phone.

35:51.489 --> 35:52.723
It's 11:00.

35:52.724 --> 35:55.024
I want to talk to her!

35:55.026 --> 35:56.193
She's got a big play.

35:56.194 --> 35:58.095
I want to fucking
help her with her lines.

35:58.096 --> 35:59.630
You're fucking wasted.

35:59.631 --> 36:01.265
I want to see her.

36:01.266 --> 36:02.599
If you come over here,
I'm calling the police.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.101
You fucking cunt!

36:04.102 --> 36:06.369
Fuck.

36:14.878 --> 36:17.113
Evelyn!

36:18.482 --> 36:19.650
Fuck.

36:19.651 --> 36:21.485
Fuck you! Goddamn it!

36:21.486 --> 36:25.221
Let me in!

36:25.223 --> 36:26.290
Go away.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.457
No, I want to talk to you.

36:27.458 --> 36:28.725
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

36:28.726 --> 36:29.927
Don't touch me!

36:29.928 --> 36:31.094
Fucking...

36:31.095 --> 36:32.529
Let go of me!

36:32.530 --> 36:35.092
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Get off her!

36:35.632 --> 36:37.201
You drunk asshole!

36:37.202 --> 36:38.435
Who hits their own son?

36:38.436 --> 36:39.469
He hit me first.

36:39.470 --> 36:41.470
Are you okay?

36:41.773 --> 36:43.473
Shit. You called the cops.

36:43.474 --> 36:45.175
Yeah, I called the cops.

36:45.176 --> 36:47.044
Fuck. Why? What are you doing?

36:47.045 --> 36:48.946
- You're crazy!
- How can you do this to me?

36:48.947 --> 36:50.781
Hutchins, what the
hell are you doing?

36:50.782 --> 36:52.115
I want to see my
fucking daughter.

36:52.116 --> 36:53.684
Yeah? Well, you're
waking the neighborhood.

36:53.685 --> 36:55.219
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

36:55.220 --> 36:57.521
You want to shoot me?
Fucking shoot me.

36:57.522 --> 36:59.709
Do you want to
walk away from this?

36:59.857 --> 37:02.491
You don't want to
get arrested again.

37:02.493 --> 37:04.894
Come on. I know how you feel.

37:05.896 --> 37:07.364
You don't know how I feel.

37:07.365 --> 37:08.865
No.

37:08.866 --> 37:13.236
But I know you won't get
arrested if you walk away now.

37:17.107 --> 37:18.175
Get him out of here.

37:18.176 --> 37:19.243
Copy that.

37:19.244 --> 37:20.811
Come on. Let's go, pal.

37:20.812 --> 37:22.679
Take him someplace to dry out.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.248
Bye, honey.

37:54.378 --> 37:56.846
Hello, ma'am.

37:56.848 --> 37:58.881
Is there a Buddy Hutchins here?

37:58.883 --> 38:00.584
Yes. He's my son.
Can I help you?

38:00.585 --> 38:03.320
We've been trying to get
ahold of him for some time now.

38:03.321 --> 38:06.522
You guys owe us 10 grand,
and we need the money.

38:06.524 --> 38:09.992
Well, he's not in right now.

38:09.994 --> 38:14.630
Well, in that case,
here's a warning.

38:16.667 --> 38:19.769
Next time, I'm gonna
come in and take him.

38:21.338 --> 38:23.673
Yes. Thank you.

38:23.675 --> 38:26.542
One more thing.

38:26.544 --> 38:30.046
We'll find him.

38:30.048 --> 38:32.248
Goodbye.

38:46.230 --> 38:49.365
The bondsman was here.

38:49.367 --> 38:50.767
Did you pay him?

38:50.768 --> 38:53.303
I don't have any money.
This is serious, Buddy.

38:53.304 --> 38:55.404
Tell him I'm at space camp.

38:55.406 --> 38:57.741
Buddy, we're gonna
have to pay these people

38:57.742 --> 38:59.609
or they will come
and take you away.

38:59.610 --> 39:01.478
That's all right.

39:01.479 --> 39:03.046
It's not all right.

39:03.047 --> 39:05.414
What do you want me to do?

39:05.416 --> 39:07.416
Clean yourself up!

39:07.418 --> 39:08.719
Get up!

39:08.720 --> 39:11.654
You're not helping
your situation here.

39:11.656 --> 39:14.523
I'm broke.

39:14.525 --> 39:18.060
Your father has some
stuff down in the basement,

39:18.062 --> 39:19.763
some old jewelry
and other things,

39:19.764 --> 39:21.598
and maybe, maybe
it's worth something.

39:21.599 --> 39:23.066
Yeah?

39:23.067 --> 39:26.068
Buddy.

39:28.139 --> 39:29.873
I'm trying!

39:29.874 --> 39:32.442
I don't want you to end
up like your father!

39:32.443 --> 39:33.810
Come here, mom.

39:33.811 --> 39:35.212
I don't want you to end
up like him. Please!

39:35.213 --> 39:36.480
Mom, mom.

39:36.481 --> 39:37.814
I want you to be okay!

39:37.815 --> 39:39.815
All right.

39:40.451 --> 39:41.651
God!

39:41.652 --> 39:43.986
Don't be scared, all right?

39:43.988 --> 39:45.255
I'm gonna figure it out.

39:45.256 --> 39:47.456
Mom, I'm gonna
figure it out, okay?

39:47.458 --> 39:48.959
I don't want to make you upset.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.460
I'll figure it out.

39:50.461 --> 39:52.461
I'll figure it out, all right?

39:52.463 --> 39:53.730
Okay.

39:53.731 --> 39:55.565
I'll figure it out, okay?

39:55.566 --> 39:57.933
Don't cry. I'll figure it out.

40:07.778 --> 40:10.079
Mr. Hutchins, I'm sorry,

40:10.081 --> 40:11.982
but you can't
take out a second loan.

40:11.983 --> 40:13.983
I want to help you.

40:13.985 --> 40:16.619
I do. I really do.
But...

40:20.857 --> 40:24.393
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

40:44.115 --> 40:46.482
Hello?

40:46.484 --> 40:48.285
Bro.

40:48.286 --> 40:49.619
Buddy?

40:49.620 --> 40:50.854
Yeah, bro.

40:50.855 --> 40:52.656
You're wasted.

40:52.657 --> 40:54.291
No, I'm not.

40:54.292 --> 40:55.525
Don't bullshit me.

40:55.526 --> 40:57.494
I'm not bullshitting you, man.

40:57.495 --> 40:59.762
All right.

40:59.764 --> 41:02.832
I'm calling because
I need your help.

41:02.834 --> 41:04.301
You know something, Buddy?

41:04.302 --> 41:06.803
Things always come up
when you've been drinking.

41:06.804 --> 41:09.438
No. I know.
Okay?

41:09.440 --> 41:12.374
I know. I'm the fuck-up.

41:12.376 --> 41:15.578
You're the
perfect brother, okay?

41:15.580 --> 41:17.981
Can you just fucking
stop lecturing me, please?

41:17.982 --> 41:20.983
Damn it, Buddy.
You are so drunk.

41:20.985 --> 41:24.320
Fucking help me, man.

41:24.322 --> 41:27.923
God, I forgot what a
fucking asshole you are.

41:27.925 --> 41:30.426
What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:30.428 --> 41:31.661
We're brothers!

41:31.662 --> 41:34.230
Buddy, goddamn it.

41:34.232 --> 41:36.266
I don't know why
I fucking called you.

41:36.267 --> 41:38.267
Buddy, listen.

41:39.337 --> 41:40.704
Buddy?

41:40.705 --> 41:42.938
Buddy?

41:56.354 --> 41:58.421
Hey, bro. I've been looking
all over for you, man.

41:58.422 --> 41:59.856
I don't have your money.

41:59.857 --> 42:03.559
I'm staying at my mom's.

42:03.561 --> 42:04.995
No wonder I couldn't find you.

42:04.996 --> 42:07.429
I got to be honest with you.

42:07.431 --> 42:09.999
What's up?

42:13.904 --> 42:16.005
What a bitch, bro.

42:16.007 --> 42:18.941
I seem to attract them all.

42:18.943 --> 42:22.711
Some friend?

42:22.713 --> 42:24.847
Yeah, well...

42:24.849 --> 42:27.316
You should kill him.

42:27.318 --> 42:29.451
I mean, he fucked
you over, right?

42:29.453 --> 42:32.221
Nah, I just don't understand

42:32.223 --> 42:34.658
why your brother won't
help you out, man.

42:34.659 --> 42:36.459
I mean, the dude is super paid.

42:36.460 --> 42:40.329
Let me tell you something
about human beings.

42:40.331 --> 42:47.069
99.9% of all of them
are pieces of shit.

42:47.071 --> 42:50.606
Tell me about it.

42:56.212 --> 42:59.248
Listen. I'm sorry
about your money.

42:59.250 --> 43:03.285
I'm gonna get things right.
I'm gonna pay you back.

43:03.287 --> 43:05.789
I know you're good
for it, man. Honestly.

43:05.790 --> 43:07.357
I know you're good for it.

43:07.358 --> 43:09.425
I'm just upset

43:09.427 --> 43:12.495
the way that everything kind
of went down, you know?

43:12.496 --> 43:13.897
But listen.

43:13.898 --> 43:15.832
I got your back, Buddy.

43:15.833 --> 43:17.233
Well, thank you.

43:17.234 --> 43:19.902
That's what friends are for.

43:19.904 --> 43:21.904
Whatever you need.

43:23.407 --> 43:25.407
Appreciate that.

43:47.865 --> 43:50.599
Mom!

43:50.601 --> 43:52.402
Mom!

43:52.403 --> 43:54.903
Mom!

43:54.905 --> 43:57.940
Hey. Well?

43:57.942 --> 43:59.376
She had a heart attack.

43:59.377 --> 44:00.410
And?

44:00.411 --> 44:02.379
Well, we need to
run a few more tests

44:02.380 --> 44:04.014
to see if there's any blockage.

44:04.015 --> 44:05.415
Well, how long will that take?

44:05.416 --> 44:06.950
To be honest, we're pretty
backed up here.

44:06.951 --> 44:08.151
It might not be for
a couple of days.

44:08.152 --> 44:09.753
A couple of days?!

44:09.754 --> 44:13.288
And I should also tell you,
if there is any blockage,

44:13.290 --> 44:14.658
we're not equipped here

44:14.659 --> 44:17.226
to perform the
surgery she would need.

44:17.228 --> 44:18.962
St. Mary's would
be a better place.

44:18.963 --> 44:20.230
Well, can you take her there?

44:20.231 --> 44:22.531
She doesn't have any insurance.

44:22.533 --> 44:25.668
So? Can you do anything?

44:25.670 --> 44:28.270
I'm sorry.

44:32.543 --> 44:35.044
I'm sorry, mom.

44:37.114 --> 44:40.349
I'm sorry.

44:45.055 --> 44:47.589
I'm sorry.

45:01.538 --> 45:05.307
Mom?

45:24.428 --> 45:25.762
Hello?

45:25.763 --> 45:27.130
Yeah, Billy. It's Buddy.

45:27.131 --> 45:28.665
I need to speak to Troy.

45:28.666 --> 45:30.799
My name is Bobby.

45:30.801 --> 45:33.035
Get me Troy, please.

45:33.037 --> 45:35.171
Troy is asleep right now, Buddy.
What can I do for you?

45:35.172 --> 45:37.773
It's important.

45:37.775 --> 45:40.042
Hold on.

45:40.044 --> 45:41.678
Hey.

45:41.679 --> 45:43.746
it's your brother.

45:43.748 --> 45:44.948
What?

45:44.949 --> 45:46.982
It's your brother.

45:46.984 --> 45:49.518
My God.

45:51.922 --> 45:53.790
Yeah?

45:53.791 --> 45:55.191
Troy, mom's sick.

45:55.192 --> 45:56.993
She's in the hospital.

45:56.994 --> 45:58.962
What happened?

45:58.963 --> 46:01.797
She had a heart attack.

46:01.799 --> 46:03.733
Really?

46:03.734 --> 46:05.034
Yeah.

46:05.035 --> 46:06.936
They're gonna run a
bunch of tests on her

46:06.937 --> 46:09.672
and see what happens,
but they can't do it here.

46:09.673 --> 46:11.407
They got to take
her to St. Mary's.

46:11.408 --> 46:12.475
Okay.

46:12.476 --> 46:15.611
She doesn't have any insurance.

46:17.615 --> 46:19.883
Well, let's just run
the tests in the morning,

46:19.884 --> 46:21.251
see what happens.

46:21.252 --> 46:23.919
She needs to go
to St. Mary's now.

46:23.921 --> 46:25.188
I don't think so.

46:25.189 --> 46:26.689
I think she's tough.

46:26.690 --> 46:28.458
I think she'll make it.
She'll be fine. All right?

46:28.459 --> 46:32.828
Come on. Come on,
man. Come on, man.

46:32.830 --> 46:34.264
Come on, man.

46:34.265 --> 46:36.733
What? It's the middle
of the night, Buddy.

46:36.734 --> 46:38.034
Don't do this.

46:38.035 --> 46:39.502
Don't do what?

46:39.503 --> 46:41.371
Don't take out
your anger towards her

46:41.372 --> 46:43.506
because she doesn't
approve of your lifestyle.

46:43.507 --> 46:45.775
Buddy, this has nothing
to do with that, all right?

46:45.776 --> 46:48.610
That's bullshit. Come on.

46:48.612 --> 46:51.114
I got to get up early
tomorrow, all right?

46:51.115 --> 46:52.816
Good night. Bye.

46:52.817 --> 46:54.250
Troy

46:54.251 --> 46:56.351
fuck.

47:02.058 --> 47:04.293
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

47:04.295 --> 47:05.795
Are you with Mrs. Hutchins?

47:05.796 --> 47:07.030
I am.

47:07.031 --> 47:09.631
This is for you.

47:09.633 --> 47:10.967
What is this?

47:10.968 --> 47:12.535
It's the bill.

47:12.536 --> 47:14.536
For what?

47:16.739 --> 47:19.908
Jesus Christ.

48:28.244 --> 48:29.712
Her condition is worsening.

48:29.713 --> 48:31.648
- She needs to rest right now.
- I need to see her.

48:31.649 --> 48:33.682
- This is not... right now.
- Move!

48:33.684 --> 48:35.451
- Sir, this is not
- security!

48:35.452 --> 48:39.021
Mom. Mom.
Mom, wake up.

48:39.023 --> 48:40.456
Mom, where's dad?

48:40.457 --> 48:43.392
Did dad kill his brother?

48:47.363 --> 48:50.465
Did he kill his brother?

48:50.467 --> 48:53.969
I didn't think you'd
ever see that.

48:53.971 --> 48:55.672
Mom.

48:55.673 --> 48:58.106
Did he do it?

48:59.877 --> 49:03.845
He had his dark side.

49:05.916 --> 49:07.916
No, mom.

49:09.787 --> 49:12.821
Mom.
Mom, you okay?

49:12.823 --> 49:15.190
I'm not well.

49:15.192 --> 49:17.126
Mom.

49:17.127 --> 49:19.661
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.

49:19.663 --> 49:21.597
Mom!

49:21.598 --> 49:24.099
I need you tell me where he is.

49:24.101 --> 49:26.335
- Buddy!
- Mom, tell me, please.

49:26.337 --> 49:28.004
I need to know.

49:28.005 --> 49:29.839
- Should...
- Mom, tell me.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.940
Not like this.

49:30.941 --> 49:33.208
Mom, tell me please!
I need to know.

49:33.210 --> 49:36.345
He's on his brother's...

49:38.148 --> 49:39.983
What?

49:39.984 --> 49:41.884
Mom.

49:41.885 --> 49:43.486
Mom!

49:43.487 --> 49:45.021
Help!

49:45.022 --> 49:47.456
Mom!

49:56.100 --> 49:58.233
Dad.

49:58.235 --> 50:00.435
Who's that?

50:00.437 --> 50:02.437
Who's that?

50:05.041 --> 50:07.909
It's me.

50:12.849 --> 50:15.517
Shit.

50:15.519 --> 50:18.920
How did you find me?

50:18.922 --> 50:21.256
Mom told me.

50:21.258 --> 50:25.060
Right before she died.

50:28.498 --> 50:30.066
Are you alone?

50:30.067 --> 50:32.067
Yes.

50:39.742 --> 50:41.977
Nice place.

50:43.780 --> 50:47.649
Look at you.

50:47.651 --> 50:52.521
You're like a crazy
old piece of shit.

50:52.523 --> 50:56.124
What'd you come here for, Bud?

50:56.126 --> 50:59.361
You left me.

50:59.363 --> 51:02.497
Yeah.

51:02.499 --> 51:04.434
I'm sorry about that.

51:04.435 --> 51:06.402
Yeah?

51:06.403 --> 51:09.771
You don't give a shit.

51:09.773 --> 51:11.973
I know.

51:11.975 --> 51:14.142
Guess what else.

51:15.912 --> 51:17.847
I found a little
bit of information

51:17.848 --> 51:20.382
I think you might
find interesting.

51:20.384 --> 51:22.517
Yeah?

51:22.519 --> 51:25.587
What would that be,
Buddy? What would that be?

51:25.589 --> 51:28.323
Tell me something.

51:28.325 --> 51:31.693
How'd your brother die?

51:34.130 --> 51:36.364
Where you going with this, Bud?

51:36.366 --> 51:38.433
Where's this taking us?

51:40.269 --> 51:43.405
The truth.

51:43.407 --> 51:46.441
Did you kill him?

51:48.010 --> 51:50.412
I think...

51:50.414 --> 51:52.481
I think it's time you left, Bud.

51:52.483 --> 51:54.050
Right now.

51:54.051 --> 51:56.084
Right now.

51:56.086 --> 51:58.687
What are you gonna do?

51:58.689 --> 52:01.556
You gonna shoot me?

52:01.558 --> 52:04.292
Did you kill him?

52:04.294 --> 52:06.294
I had to.

52:06.296 --> 52:08.497
You son of a bitch!

52:10.434 --> 52:13.101
Shit!

52:13.103 --> 52:14.303
Shit.

52:14.304 --> 52:15.905
Christ.

52:15.906 --> 52:17.106
Fuck.

52:17.107 --> 52:19.541
Holy shit.

52:25.449 --> 52:27.949
She was a whore.

52:29.051 --> 52:30.319
What?

52:30.320 --> 52:32.387
She was whore.

52:32.389 --> 52:35.257
And I'm not your father.

52:37.528 --> 52:40.829
What?

52:40.831 --> 52:45.800
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

52:45.802 --> 52:50.405
She was, she was just a slut.

52:50.407 --> 52:53.508
So, you killed him?

52:58.681 --> 53:04.719
My brother, my brother
was your father.

53:06.756 --> 53:10.158
When I found out...

53:10.160 --> 53:11.561
I killed him.

53:11.562 --> 53:13.562
I'm sorry.

53:14.631 --> 53:17.566
I just ran.

53:17.568 --> 53:20.602
And here I am.

53:27.043 --> 53:30.579
I'm so sorry.

53:30.581 --> 53:33.181
I'll tell you one thing.

53:36.453 --> 53:39.521
If I...

53:39.523 --> 53:44.659
If I had the chance all over...

53:44.661 --> 53:49.531
If I could do it all over,

53:49.533 --> 53:52.734
I'd do it all again.

53:52.736 --> 53:55.403
I wouldn't change.

53:55.405 --> 53:57.939
I wouldn't change a damn thing.

53:57.941 --> 54:03.144
Not one... not one fucking...

54:52.729 --> 54:55.730
Fucking bitch thinks I won't go.

55:08.278 --> 55:10.278
I'll fucking go.

55:11.481 --> 55:14.356
I don't have a wallet.
I don't have any money.

55:21.558 --> 55:22.792
Fuck.

55:22.793 --> 55:24.826
What's up, white boy?

55:24.828 --> 55:27.395
You again?

55:27.397 --> 55:29.231
Carol couldn't come herself?

55:29.232 --> 55:30.966
Don't worry about her.

55:30.967 --> 55:32.368
She okay.

55:32.369 --> 55:33.969
This isn't a good time.

55:33.970 --> 55:36.037
Just pay up and I'll leave.

55:36.039 --> 55:38.840
I don't have any fucking money.

55:39.775 --> 55:42.277
Show me, motherfucker.

55:42.279 --> 55:45.914
Jesus Christ.

55:45.916 --> 55:47.916
You ain't got no money?

55:47.918 --> 55:49.819
Tell Carol she'll
get her fucking money!

55:49.820 --> 55:51.354
You're not dealing with Carol.

55:51.355 --> 55:53.856
You're dealing with me
right now. Ricky rich, bitch.

55:53.857 --> 55:56.424
Suck a rich nigger's dick.

55:57.793 --> 56:00.228
There's some money
in this bitch.

56:02.798 --> 56:06.668
You could have got
$50 for this, man.

56:06.670 --> 56:08.037
But now it's too late.

56:08.038 --> 56:09.605
Let me see that
watch right there.

56:09.606 --> 56:11.374
- Fucking watch.
- It's not worth anything.

56:11.375 --> 56:12.575
Let me see the fucking watch.

56:12.576 --> 56:13.976
- It's not
- it's not worth anything!

56:13.977 --> 56:15.845
I didn't ask you.
Give me the fucking watch!

56:15.846 --> 56:17.947
I have to go to
my daughter's play.

56:17.948 --> 56:19.648
I don't give a fuck
about the play.

56:19.649 --> 56:21.050
I'm not fucking
playing with you.

56:21.051 --> 56:22.952
This is not no fucking game, yo.

56:22.953 --> 56:25.121
You could have got
have got a few bucks

56:25.122 --> 56:26.822
for this shit right here, man.

56:26.823 --> 56:28.424
Fuck is wrong with you, man?

56:28.425 --> 56:29.625
What's this?

56:29.626 --> 56:30.926
Don't touch that.

56:30.927 --> 56:33.095
- You play? You play?
- Don't touch it.

56:33.096 --> 56:35.230
- This is a nice
- looking guitar?

56:35.232 --> 56:37.499
I play, too.

56:37.501 --> 56:38.934
You want to hear something?

56:38.935 --> 56:40.302
No, man.
Just please don't.

56:40.303 --> 56:42.338
You play. You want
to hear some shit?

56:42.339 --> 56:44.406
You want to hear something?

56:44.408 --> 56:46.408
Fuck you, boy.

56:48.145 --> 56:51.312
You shouldn't have done that.

56:52.815 --> 56:55.583
I don't have any fucking money!

57:00.723 --> 57:03.858
Fuck!

57:05.429 --> 57:06.729
What did you do?!

57:06.730 --> 57:08.330
Shut the fuck up!

57:08.331 --> 57:10.598
Fucking dumb...

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
Fuck up!

57:12.602 --> 57:14.570
Shit.

57:14.571 --> 57:16.571
Shit!

57:33.355 --> 57:35.324
Hey.

57:35.325 --> 57:37.759
Is everything all right?

57:37.761 --> 57:39.762
Yeah, just, doing
some gardening.

57:39.763 --> 57:41.130
In a suit?

57:41.131 --> 57:42.865
Yeah, that place
really needs it.

57:42.866 --> 57:44.233
There's a lot of weeds.

57:44.234 --> 57:47.068
You mind if we go
inside for a sec?

57:47.070 --> 57:49.605
Actually, I'm on my
way out, if that's okay.

57:49.606 --> 57:50.806
Is there a problem?

57:50.807 --> 57:52.675
I'm sorry about the cleaners.

57:52.676 --> 57:54.310
I'm sorry about your mom.

57:54.311 --> 57:57.846
She was a nice lady.

57:57.848 --> 58:02.217
How you doing in regards to
your other, domestic situation?

58:02.219 --> 58:05.887
Coping.

58:05.889 --> 58:06.989
Buddy!

58:06.990 --> 58:09.290
- Is someone in there?
- No.

58:09.292 --> 58:11.292
I... no.

58:20.437 --> 58:22.004
All right.

58:22.005 --> 58:24.806
Don't.

58:24.808 --> 58:26.609
Shut up!

58:26.610 --> 58:28.277
Okay, whatever's going on,

58:28.278 --> 58:30.512
you do not want to shoot a cop.

58:30.514 --> 58:32.114
Fuck.

58:32.115 --> 58:34.215
Why does this keep happening?

58:34.217 --> 58:35.651
Don't.

58:35.652 --> 58:37.152
Don't!

58:37.153 --> 58:39.153
Don't!

58:41.558 --> 58:43.558
Shit.

59:04.748 --> 59:07.415
You want to fucking
act like a pig?

59:07.417 --> 59:10.418
I'm gonna treat you
like a fucking pig.

59:15.959 --> 59:18.993
I'll give you
your fucking money.

59:39.682 --> 59:41.682
Daddy!

59:43.320 --> 59:45.787
Buddy, what are you doing here?

59:45.789 --> 59:49.490
What? You think I'd miss
my little babies play? No.

59:50.393 --> 59:53.127
- You're hurting her.
- Shut up!

59:53.129 --> 59:55.129
I would never hurt her.

59:55.131 --> 59:57.165
I would never hurt you.

59:57.167 --> 59:59.867
- You know that, honey?
- I know, daddy.

59:59.869 --> 01:00:01.971
Jesus, Buddy.
Have you been drinking?

01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:05.006
You know what?
I'm gonna check on the car.

01:00:05.008 --> 01:00:07.175
Just go, Don.

01:00:07.177 --> 01:00:10.111
Yeah. Just go, Don.

01:00:10.113 --> 01:00:13.414
Just go, Don.

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:15.250
Shoo, Don.

01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:18.820
Thanks for looking
after my wife, Don.

01:00:18.822 --> 01:00:21.055
Yeah. You know what, man?

01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:23.758
- You're a mess.
- Yeah.

01:00:25.028 --> 01:00:28.329
Call me when you reach 5'10".

01:00:28.331 --> 01:00:30.065
You're unbelievable, Buddy.

01:00:30.066 --> 01:00:34.168
And you're a cum dumpster
full of semen.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.071
What are you looking at?

01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:38.940
Guys, easy.

01:00:38.942 --> 01:00:41.310
All right, come on.
Go to the car, okay?

01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:42.111
No!

01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:44.979
Come here, honey.
Come here.

01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:46.248
Daddy loves you.

01:00:46.249 --> 01:00:49.083
Daddy's gonna see
you soon, okay?

01:00:53.857 --> 01:00:55.990
Bye, daddy.

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:57.259
Bye.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.061
I'm sorry about Bertha.

01:01:00.063 --> 01:01:02.196
You never liked her.

01:01:02.198 --> 01:01:04.600
I'm not getting into this
with you right now.

01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:06.535
What happened to us?

01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:08.671
I'm not talking to you
about this right now.

01:01:08.672 --> 01:01:11.406
I fucking hate you!

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:15.544
I hope you get well.

01:01:15.545 --> 01:01:18.279
I really do.

01:01:18.281 --> 01:01:21.082
You did this to me!

01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:23.818
You ruined my fucking life!

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.320
Cunt bag!

01:01:25.321 --> 01:01:28.056
Come on, man.
There's kids around here.

01:01:28.058 --> 01:01:32.593
Fuck you, Bart.

01:01:45.775 --> 01:01:48.443
Shit.

01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:50.912
Hey, Buddy.

01:01:50.914 --> 01:01:52.914
Detective.

01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:56.318
What happened to you?

01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:59.053
I was... I was gardening.

01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:02.056
- In a suit?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.493 --> 01:02:06.928
How much you have
to drink tonight?

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.996
A couple.

01:02:08.998 --> 01:02:11.733
Limmy stop by earlier?

01:02:11.735 --> 01:02:13.801
No. I didn't see him.

01:02:16.473 --> 01:02:18.440
Is that it?

01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:21.242
One more thing.

01:02:21.244 --> 01:02:23.878
I understand you
want to see your kid,

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.116
but don't go down there
screaming your head off, okay?

01:02:27.117 --> 01:02:29.884
You got it.
Won't happen again.

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:31.787
Help!

01:02:31.788 --> 01:02:33.722
You hear that?

01:02:33.723 --> 01:02:36.724
- No. I don't
- I don't...

01:02:36.726 --> 01:02:38.726
I don't hear nothing.

01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:43.431
I'll see you real soon.

01:02:57.846 --> 01:03:00.681
Buddy, please don't do this.

01:03:00.683 --> 01:03:02.817
I love you, baby.

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:04.720
I'm so sorry.

01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:06.121
Please.

01:03:06.122 --> 01:03:10.258
Remember... remember all the
good times we had together.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.560
Shut the fuck up!

01:03:18.567 --> 01:03:23.471
You picked the wrong day
to pay me a little visit.

01:03:24.307 --> 01:03:27.775
I'm so sorry! Please!

01:03:27.777 --> 01:03:29.811
I just found out that

01:03:29.813 --> 01:03:35.283
the man who I thought was
my real father was my Uncle.

01:03:35.285 --> 01:03:43.285
And my Uncle killed the
man who was my real dad.

01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:46.694
They were both fucking my mom,

01:03:46.696 --> 01:03:49.163
who just died,

01:03:49.165 --> 01:03:51.833
who I loved very much.

01:03:51.835 --> 01:03:54.335
My son won't talk to me.

01:03:54.337 --> 01:03:59.240
My wife is banging a
substitute French teacher.

01:03:59.242 --> 01:04:03.311
I just killed your
black boyfriend.

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:06.214
And on top of all that,

01:04:06.216 --> 01:04:09.817
my dry cleaning business
has gone in the shitter.

01:04:11.386 --> 01:04:19.093
Now, do you think I want to
hear anything... from you?

01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:39.747
Shit.

01:04:43.286 --> 01:04:45.319
- Hello?
- They just called me.

01:04:45.321 --> 01:04:46.989
Yeah?

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:48.357
I can't believe it happened.

01:04:48.358 --> 01:04:49.892
What did you think
was gonna happen?

01:04:49.893 --> 01:04:51.260
Goddamn it, Buddy.

01:04:51.261 --> 01:04:52.928
I didn't think it
would happen this quick.

01:04:52.929 --> 01:04:53.996
Yeah?

01:04:53.997 --> 01:04:56.030
Well, you could have saved her.

01:04:56.032 --> 01:04:57.633
Buddy, don't start on me.

01:04:57.634 --> 01:04:59.800
Man, you could have saved her.

01:04:59.802 --> 01:05:01.103
Buddy!

01:05:01.104 --> 01:05:02.938
I told you she shouldn't
have been in there, man.

01:05:02.939 --> 01:05:05.340
I told you she should have
been in St. Mary's.

01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:06.742
What the fuck?!

01:05:06.743 --> 01:05:08.877
I know you told me that,
but goddamn it, Buddy.

01:05:08.878 --> 01:05:11.512
- She was old.
- And you let her die.

01:05:11.514 --> 01:05:14.382
Buddy, my mother just died.

01:05:14.384 --> 01:05:16.717
I don't need to
hear it from you.

01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:18.786
My God!

01:05:18.788 --> 01:05:20.222
Don't give me that shit!

01:05:20.223 --> 01:05:24.158
Fucking everybody's
fucking nuts.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.861
Go make yourself a drink

01:05:25.862 --> 01:05:29.764
and stir it with your flaccid,
little, effectual whiskey dick.

01:05:29.766 --> 01:05:31.766
Fuck you!

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:35.670
You know what?

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.273
Time to make myself a drink.

01:05:45.348 --> 01:05:47.848
Hope you got ice, bro.

01:05:58.861 --> 01:06:01.096
Yeah, I did want to
order the chicken because

01:06:01.097 --> 01:06:02.764
- it's, like, low carbs, right?
- Yeah, well...

01:06:02.765 --> 01:06:05.640
That's why I told him,
"get the scampi." Yeah.

01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:11.297
So, anyway, so, I'm gonna
order the chicken, right?

01:06:11.298 --> 01:06:13.551
So I don't say scampi
with a gay "s," right?

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:14.109
Scampi.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.711
You know what I'm
saying? So gay.

01:06:15.712 --> 01:06:17.045
That's funny.

01:06:17.046 --> 01:06:19.546
Hey, hold on. What's
going on out there?

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:23.017
Can you see what it is?

01:06:26.455 --> 01:06:28.789
I'm here for my drink.

01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:34.329
I see you got a chainsaw.

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.897
Did you come here
to cut my trees?

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.752
- I prefer Riesling.
- I'm calling the police.

01:06:51.714 --> 01:06:53.081
God!

01:06:53.082 --> 01:06:56.217
My God! My arm!

01:06:56.219 --> 01:06:57.719
You sick fuck!

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.287
Buddy, are you fucking insane?!

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:01.556
No.

01:07:01.557 --> 01:07:04.158
- You're crazy!
- I'm just angry!

01:07:05.862 --> 01:07:10.698
That's for talking
shit to Molly.

01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:14.268
I found pops.

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.937
What?

01:07:15.938 --> 01:07:18.039
I killed him, too.

01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:19.574
What are you talking about?

01:07:19.575 --> 01:07:27.081
Pops... killed... my dad.

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:32.420
<i>Uncle fucking Marshall
was my real dad.</i>

01:07:32.422 --> 01:07:35.256
What in the hell are
you talking about?

01:07:35.258 --> 01:07:38.025
I'm a goddamn bastard.

01:07:38.027 --> 01:07:40.494
Well, I'm goddamn not.

01:07:40.496 --> 01:07:43.330
Does that mean
you're gonna kill me?

01:07:43.332 --> 01:07:45.800
You want to die?

01:07:45.802 --> 01:07:49.437
I've got cameras all
over this property, Buddy.

01:07:51.506 --> 01:07:53.475
Are they on?

01:07:53.476 --> 01:07:55.410
You're goddamn
right, they're on.

01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:58.446
Well, let 'em watch.

01:08:13.196 --> 01:08:14.629
That's for mom.

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:18.299
Hello?

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:20.301
Hello?

01:08:23.406 --> 01:08:26.207
Holy shit.

01:08:28.344 --> 01:08:30.743
- 911, emergency.
- Yeah, police?

01:08:32.814 --> 01:08:36.716
<i>Local man Robert Hutchins
was found dead this morning.</i>

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:39.121
<i>Authorities were relieved
to find Mr. Hutchins,</i>

01:08:39.122 --> 01:08:41.456
<i>but they didn't expect
to find him murdered.</i>

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:45.126
<i>The cause of death was a
point-blank gunshot wound.</i>

01:08:45.127 --> 01:08:47.560
<i>No suspects have yet been named.</i>

01:08:47.563 --> 01:08:51.564
<i>Robert Hutchins is
survived by two sons,</i>

01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:55.102
<i>Troy and Buddy Hutchins.</i>

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:10.184
Buddy?

01:09:10.185 --> 01:09:14.587
Dude, what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.191
I just heard your
name on the radio.

01:09:17.193 --> 01:09:19.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:19.662 --> 01:09:22.229
They found your father.

01:09:22.231 --> 01:09:25.499
No shit.

01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:28.602
Yeah, he was killed.

01:09:28.604 --> 01:09:32.238
<i>He wasn't my father.</i>

01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:33.608
Dude, you...

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:37.478
You're fucking
covered in blood, man.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.513
I cut myself.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:43.050
Buddy, is everything cool, man?

01:09:43.051 --> 01:09:45.786
Yeah.

01:09:45.787 --> 01:09:48.589
Just came by to
say hi to my pal.

01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:50.957
Can't I do that?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.329
Right. Sure.

01:10:16.485 --> 01:10:19.620
I used to be able
to chug a whole one.

01:10:25.227 --> 01:10:27.261
Is that your daughter?

01:10:27.263 --> 01:10:28.330
Come on, Buddy, man.

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:31.198
This is my girlfriend, Mandy.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.300
Hi.

01:10:33.302 --> 01:10:36.503
What's up?

01:10:36.505 --> 01:10:37.939
You're dirty.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.976
That's an astute observation.

01:10:41.978 --> 01:10:47.281
Baby, why don't you
go inside the house

01:10:47.283 --> 01:10:49.583
and let Buddy and I talk, okay?

01:10:49.585 --> 01:10:51.885
Okay?

01:10:57.425 --> 01:11:00.261
You mind?

01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:02.730
Go ahead, bro. Sure.

01:11:20.483 --> 01:11:22.950
So, what's up?

01:11:43.872 --> 01:11:46.640
Are you my friend?

01:11:46.642 --> 01:11:48.209
Yeah, Buddy.

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.311
I'm your friend, man.

01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:58.285
There you go.

01:12:00.056 --> 01:12:01.356
We cool?

01:12:01.357 --> 01:12:05.125
Bro, this is like two g's, man.

01:12:05.127 --> 01:12:06.361
I can't take this.

01:12:06.362 --> 01:12:10.230
Buy your little
spinner something nice.

01:12:10.232 --> 01:12:12.033
Nah, man.

01:12:12.034 --> 01:12:15.669
I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:12:15.671 --> 01:12:19.206
I'm not gonna need it.

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:24.511
Buddy, man...

01:12:24.513 --> 01:12:30.584
Everything all right?

01:12:30.586 --> 01:12:33.687
Yeah.

01:12:33.689 --> 01:12:37.491
Everything's cool.

01:12:37.493 --> 01:12:41.395
See you around, amigo.

01:12:41.397 --> 01:12:43.397
Yeah.

01:12:43.399 --> 01:12:46.233
If some weird shit goes down,

01:12:46.235 --> 01:12:49.303
I just need you to
bring Molly to me, okay?

01:12:49.305 --> 01:12:52.339
I'll be with a guy
named Duncan moldavan.

01:12:52.341 --> 01:12:55.442
Look him up.

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.689
That's Buddy.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:09.690
Yeah

01:13:21.569 --> 01:13:25.472
we found Limmy out back.

01:13:25.474 --> 01:13:27.941
Roger that.

01:14:10.352 --> 01:14:12.153
Hello, Mr. Hutchins.

01:14:12.154 --> 01:14:14.055
I'm here to surprise Molly.

01:14:14.056 --> 01:14:16.324
- We're playing dress-up.
- Okay. Great.

01:14:16.325 --> 01:14:19.960
All right, well, I need
you to do me a favor.

01:14:19.962 --> 01:14:23.397
Can you hide so it's me
that just surprises her?

01:14:23.399 --> 01:14:24.532
Yeah.

01:14:24.533 --> 01:14:26.901
Okay, do you have a
favorite place to hide?

01:14:26.902 --> 01:14:28.503
That place over there.

01:14:28.504 --> 01:14:30.771
Perfect. Okay, good.

01:14:30.773 --> 01:14:33.107
Okay. Now go hide there and
I'll come get you later, okay?

01:14:33.108 --> 01:14:34.676
But remember, you
got to be quiet.

01:14:34.677 --> 01:14:35.743
- Got it.
- Okay, awesome.

01:14:35.744 --> 01:14:37.078
This is gonna be so much fun.

01:14:37.079 --> 01:14:38.513
I'm gonna buy both
of you guys ice cream.

01:14:38.514 --> 01:14:39.514
Yay!

01:14:39.515 --> 01:14:42.282
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:52.459
So this is what
you've been up to?

01:14:52.461 --> 01:14:54.062
Taking over my family.

01:14:54.063 --> 01:14:57.764
- Daddy!
- Hi, honey.

01:14:57.766 --> 01:14:59.601
Everything okay?

01:14:59.602 --> 01:15:01.135
You stink.

01:15:01.136 --> 01:15:04.137
I was taking out the trash.

01:15:04.139 --> 01:15:07.241
Unfortunately, there's a lot.

01:15:07.243 --> 01:15:09.310
- Where's, mommy?
- She's with Joel.

01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:11.546
Okay, good. Well, here's
what I need you to do.

01:15:11.547 --> 01:15:12.881
I'm gonna need you to go outside

01:15:12.882 --> 01:15:15.149
and wait for me in
the car, okay, honey?

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:18.318
We have to have an
adult talk now, okay?

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.155
Okay, I'm just gonna get Mr. elephant.

01:15:22.157 --> 01:15:24.259
No, no, no, no, no, honey.
I'll bring him to you, okay?

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.628
Just go in the car
and wait for me, okay?

01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:28.729
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye, honey.

01:15:28.731 --> 01:15:31.665
Bye.

01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:33.268
Okay, honey!

01:15:33.269 --> 01:15:35.136
Just wait for me.

01:15:35.137 --> 01:15:37.137
Okay?

01:15:37.139 --> 01:15:39.907
Hey, Don.

01:15:39.909 --> 01:15:43.744
What you been doing?

01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:47.381
I got a question for you, Don.

01:15:47.383 --> 01:15:52.753
How long have you been
fucking my wife?

01:15:54.089 --> 01:15:56.456
Two years.

01:15:58.494 --> 01:16:00.794
Wow, I thought it
was like a month.

01:16:00.796 --> 01:16:06.433
Is she good in the sack?

01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:11.738
Tell me something, Don.

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:15.008
How do you fuck her?

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:19.179
She get on top, spin around?

01:16:19.181 --> 01:16:21.915
Do you get behind her?

01:16:22.985 --> 01:16:27.588
Pound her into the pillow?

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:29.023
You ever fuck her ass?

01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:31.258
- Jesus.
- Right.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.595
You ever take that little,
puckered starfish

01:16:34.597 --> 01:16:37.331
and just fuck it?

01:16:39.001 --> 01:16:40.735
What's wrong with you, man?

01:16:40.736 --> 01:16:42.736
Push her shit in.

01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:46.740
Not to be nosy or anything,
but how'd it start?

01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:48.242
I'd like to know, Don.

01:16:48.243 --> 01:16:51.579
Did it start in, like, a
teacher's lounge or something?

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.381
Or one day you started
a little chitchat?

01:16:54.383 --> 01:16:57.685
You started talking a little
French to her, didn't you?

01:16:57.686 --> 01:17:01.254
You started saying a little,
"parlez-vous français,"

01:17:01.256 --> 01:17:04.057
"oui, blah, blah,

01:17:04.059 --> 01:17:06.860
I'd like to touch your pussy,"

01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:08.962
no, it wasn't like that, man.

01:17:08.964 --> 01:17:11.665
It wasn't?

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:14.001
How was it?

01:17:14.003 --> 01:17:18.572
Did you fuck her in
the cafeteria, Don?

01:17:18.574 --> 01:17:22.142
You fuck her against
a chalkboard?

01:17:22.144 --> 01:17:23.578
What do you want to know, man?

01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:25.480
What do I want to know?!

01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:29.016
I would like to know
the fucking truth.

01:17:29.018 --> 01:17:31.485
Do you fucking love my wife?

01:17:31.487 --> 01:17:34.688
Do you love her?

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:35.690
Listen, man.

01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:37.525
You break into my fucking house,

01:17:37.526 --> 01:17:40.293
you talk to me like
this in my own place,

01:17:40.295 --> 01:17:42.930
- I don't fucking like it, Buddy.
- You don't like it?

01:17:42.931 --> 01:17:45.132
Don. Look.

01:17:45.134 --> 01:17:46.334
Cry me a river.

01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:49.903
World's smallest
fucking violin, Don.

01:17:49.905 --> 01:17:51.938
Fuck you, Don.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.275
What the fuck are
you gonna do about it?

01:17:54.276 --> 01:17:57.811
What are you gonna do?

01:17:57.813 --> 01:17:59.580
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

01:17:59.581 --> 01:18:00.882
Where's Beth?

01:18:00.883 --> 01:18:02.383
- Beth?
- Yeah.

01:18:02.384 --> 01:18:04.152
She's fine.

01:18:04.153 --> 01:18:06.486
I took care of Beth.

01:18:06.488 --> 01:18:08.656
You wouldn't fucking
do anything to Beth,

01:18:08.657 --> 01:18:10.024
would you, man?

01:18:10.025 --> 01:18:12.859
You think I would
fucking kill Beth?

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.551
Shit!

01:18:36.552 --> 01:18:38.552
Shit!

01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:18.258
Look at you.

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.961
You fucked up!

01:19:19.962 --> 01:19:22.295
Don't shoot me, Buddy.

01:19:22.297 --> 01:19:24.765
It's too late for that, Don.

01:19:24.767 --> 01:19:26.767
You fucked up.

01:19:28.637 --> 01:19:33.573
You fucked my
wife in study hall.

01:19:45.087 --> 01:19:46.821
Beth, you may want
to kill me one day

01:19:46.822 --> 01:19:49.357
'cause I killed your dad,
and I understand that.

01:19:49.358 --> 01:19:50.625
I don't blame you.

01:19:50.626 --> 01:19:52.393
But he was having
sex with my wife,

01:19:52.394 --> 01:19:54.128
and that's a big no-no.

01:19:54.129 --> 01:19:57.198
If you ever get married one day
and you find yourself cheating,

01:19:57.199 --> 01:20:01.168
remember, it affects people.

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:06.540
You'll understand
when you're older.

01:20:14.983 --> 01:20:16.983
Shit.

01:20:23.358 --> 01:20:25.358
Hold on. Hold on!

01:20:37.706 --> 01:20:38.840
Attention all units,

01:20:38.841 --> 01:20:41.403
officer Bradley in
pursuit of a blue van.

01:20:52.454 --> 01:20:54.454
Fuck!

01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:03.997
<i>Local resident Donald Wilson
was gunned down earlier today.</i>

01:21:06.201 --> 01:21:08.135
Joel, get in the car, quick!

01:21:08.136 --> 01:21:09.270
What?

01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:11.838
Get in the car!

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.940
What's going on?

01:21:13.942 --> 01:21:15.942
Something happened with Don.

01:21:39.434 --> 01:21:40.735
Don't worry, honey.

01:21:40.736 --> 01:21:42.937
Daddy's gonna take
care of you, okay?

01:21:42.938 --> 01:21:44.705
Why are they following you?

01:21:44.706 --> 01:21:47.474
Daddy did some things
he shouldn't have.

01:21:47.476 --> 01:21:49.243
Where are we going?

01:21:49.244 --> 01:21:51.645
We're gonna go see mommy, okay?

01:21:51.647 --> 01:21:54.147
Aah! Slow down!

01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:56.683
- Slow down!
- Hang in here, baby, okay?

01:22:04.927 --> 01:22:05.927
Shit.

01:22:05.928 --> 01:22:08.161
Come on, honey. Give me the bag.

01:22:08.163 --> 01:22:10.163
Give me the bag.

01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:12.667
Shit.

01:22:12.668 --> 01:22:14.668
Okay. All right.

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:18.205
Just remember, whatever happens,
I will never hurt you, okay?

01:22:18.206 --> 01:22:21.041
- Okay.
- Okay? Stay with me, okay?

01:22:21.043 --> 01:22:23.043
All right? Okay?

01:22:23.946 --> 01:22:25.546
- Look down. Look down.
- What the fuck?

01:22:25.547 --> 01:22:28.215
You looking for me?
Shut up. Open the door.

01:22:28.216 --> 01:22:30.051
Open the fucking door.

01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:32.919
Let's go. The yellow key.

01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:35.922
Let go of the girl,
or we'll open fire.

01:22:35.924 --> 01:22:39.426
Look down, honey.

01:22:39.428 --> 01:22:43.296
Get in there.

01:22:43.298 --> 01:22:46.266
So he finally snapped.

01:22:46.268 --> 01:22:49.169
Yeah, he did.

01:22:52.774 --> 01:22:54.742
Go over there and
hide, honey, okay?

01:22:54.743 --> 01:22:57.544
Give me this bag.

01:23:00.449 --> 01:23:03.116
Shots fired! Shots fired!

01:23:04.686 --> 01:23:08.254
- They got a million cops out...
-Shut up, okay?!

01:23:08.256 --> 01:23:09.690
You don't need me.
Just let me go.

01:23:09.691 --> 01:23:12.425
Let me go.
Let me think, okay?

01:23:12.427 --> 01:23:13.494
Just shut up.

01:23:13.495 --> 01:23:15.528
Look, you're scaring her.

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:17.665
Don't you fucking talk
about my daughter, okay?

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:19.666
Don't fucking say anything.

01:23:23.939 --> 01:23:25.373
Fuck.

01:23:25.374 --> 01:23:29.542
I'm hearing multiple shots
coming from inside the house.

01:23:37.152 --> 01:23:38.586
Yeah?

01:23:38.587 --> 01:23:40.321
Hey, Buddy, is everything
all right in there?

01:23:40.322 --> 01:23:42.355
Everything's fine.

01:23:42.357 --> 01:23:44.592
Listen, I'm willing to
make a deal with you.

01:23:44.593 --> 01:23:46.260
I know everything
about your wife.

01:23:46.261 --> 01:23:47.728
But if you let
the little girl go

01:23:47.729 --> 01:23:49.497
and you come out
with your hands up,

01:23:49.498 --> 01:23:51.032
this will end good for everyone.

01:23:51.033 --> 01:23:52.666
I don't trust you.

01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:55.269
I know about your brother,
and I know about your father.

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:58.738
I know about Limmy and the kid.

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.875
Look, you could possibly
plead temporary insanity.

01:24:00.876 --> 01:24:03.009
People have a
soft spot for that.

01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:04.445
But you got to work with me.

01:24:04.446 --> 01:24:05.946
I'm in too deep.

01:24:05.947 --> 01:24:08.281
You're not listen, Buddy.

01:24:08.283 --> 01:24:09.817
You got nowhere to go.

01:24:09.818 --> 01:24:12.118
Do it for Molly.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.220
Do it for her.

01:24:14.222 --> 01:24:16.489
I'll call you back.

01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:42.616
<i>Yo, Buddy, Matty D. Here
from Straight Jackitt, man.</i>

01:24:42.617 --> 01:24:43.951
<i>Sorry I haven't got back to you.</i>

01:24:43.952 --> 01:24:45.886
<i>We just got back from tour, man.</i>

01:24:45.887 --> 01:24:47.688
<i>Listen, I'm really glad to
hear from you because, like,</i>

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:49.423
<i>as of next thursday, we
got a gig in Manchester.</i>

01:24:49.424 --> 01:24:50.825
<i>If you're still interested,</i>

01:24:50.826 --> 01:24:52.193
<i>give me a call
on my cellie, bro.</i>

01:24:52.194 --> 01:24:54.194
That's great timing, Duncan.

01:24:59.034 --> 01:25:01.167
I got to tinkle.

01:25:01.169 --> 01:25:04.204
Go ahead, honey.

01:25:09.211 --> 01:25:11.244
Come on, Buddy! Let the girl go!

01:25:11.246 --> 01:25:13.246
We can work something out!

01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:48.149
Molly...

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:50.850
If you're seeing this,

01:25:50.852 --> 01:25:53.086
I'm either dead
or I'm a fugitive.

01:25:53.088 --> 01:25:55.922
<i>Remember Ryan from the cleaners?</i>

01:25:55.924 --> 01:25:58.424
<i>I need you to go
to him, find him.</i>

01:25:58.426 --> 01:26:00.760
<i>He will take you to me.</i>

01:26:00.762 --> 01:26:05.198
Don't tell anybody.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.534
I love you more than anyone.

01:26:18.179 --> 01:26:20.380
Honey, here. Take this, okay?

01:26:20.382 --> 01:26:22.516
I put something in there for
you, okay? It's just for you.

01:26:22.517 --> 01:26:24.784
- Do not show anyone.
- Okay.

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.821
Buddy, please!

01:26:27.822 --> 01:26:30.990
Now, I need you to go
outside now, okay, honey?

01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:32.760
No. No way.
I don't want to leave you.

01:26:32.761 --> 01:26:34.295
Honey, please. I need you to go.

01:26:34.296 --> 01:26:37.897
I'm sorry!
We can work things out, Buddy!

01:26:37.899 --> 01:26:39.899
Please!

01:26:40.702 --> 01:26:42.702
I don't want them to hurt you.

01:26:42.704 --> 01:26:45.171
Honey, they won't hurt me, okay?

01:26:45.173 --> 01:26:46.340
- Go now. Go.
- No.

01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:48.341
Come on, baby. Go.

01:26:49.244 --> 01:26:51.244
Okay.

01:26:57.319 --> 01:26:59.319
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

01:26:59.321 --> 01:27:01.321
What's going on?

01:27:03.191 --> 01:27:04.391
Go.

01:27:04.392 --> 01:27:05.993
We got the girl.
We got the girl.

01:27:05.994 --> 01:27:08.795
My God!

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.640
We can work something out!

01:27:54.643 --> 01:27:55.943
Now, now, now!

01:27:55.944 --> 01:27:58.678
- Out of the way!
- Go, go, go!

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.814
Shots have been fired.
Shots have been fired.

01:28:00.815 --> 01:28:05.785
Clear the area.

01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:24.271
I didn't think he was
gonna do this far.

01:28:24.272 --> 01:28:27.340
I did. He was always crazy.

01:28:27.342 --> 01:28:30.510
He's not crazy.

01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:33.179
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:51.999
Buddy?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.334
- Duncan!
- Jesus Christ.

01:28:54.336 --> 01:28:55.769
What the hell?

01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:58.071
- Yeah.
- Where you been, man?

01:29:01.275 --> 01:29:03.309
Hey, Buddy.

01:29:03.311 --> 01:29:07.447
There's someone here to see you.

01:29:07.449 --> 01:29:10.016
- Daddy!
- My God.

01:29:10.018 --> 01:29:12.585
- My God.
- Daddy!

01:29:12.587 --> 01:29:14.021
My God.

01:29:14.022 --> 01:29:16.622
Did you do what I said?

01:29:16.624 --> 01:29:19.192
- I didn't tell anybody.
- My God.

01:29:22.297 --> 01:29:24.297
Good to see you, brother.

01:29:24.299 --> 01:29:27.767
Good to see you.

01:29:48.523 --> 01:29:50.491
I can't believe he shot me.

01:29:50.492 --> 01:29:51.959
And the house blowing up?

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.727
What about Molly running off?

01:29:55.429 --> 01:29:56.997
Hey.

01:29:56.998 --> 01:29:59.532
Hey! Watch it, asshole.

01:29:59.534 --> 01:30:01.934
My God.

01:30:01.936 --> 01:30:04.771
- Shit.
- Buddy?

01:30:14.983 --> 01:30:17.350
I don't think he's a fit parent.

01:30:17.352 --> 01:30:19.520
I've known him for
quite a few years,

01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:22.489
and, honestly, I don't think
that he's done very well

01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:27.160
as far as recuperating
from his, alcoholism.

01:30:27.162 --> 01:30:29.162
He was no Buddy to anybody.

01:30:29.164 --> 01:30:32.198
He's actually just a
piece of human slime

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.135
that couldn't get over himself,
couldn't get over anything.

01:30:35.136 --> 01:30:37.737
I don't he doesn't
have responsibilities,

01:30:37.739 --> 01:30:39.673
shouldn't have
custody of anything,

01:30:39.674 --> 01:30:41.642
let alone a Facebook page.

01:30:41.643 --> 01:30:44.076
He's a worthless worm

01:30:44.078 --> 01:30:46.480
who should slither on
the ground by himself

01:30:46.481 --> 01:30:48.048
for all eternity.

01:30:48.049 --> 01:30:50.918
You know, he came to one
of my rock band's shows,

01:30:50.919 --> 01:30:54.821
and, he bought me a
shot after the show.

01:30:54.823 --> 01:30:57.990
Actually, he bought
me more than one shot.

01:30:57.992 --> 01:31:01.727
And we got pretty drunk.

01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:04.430
And, he brought his daughter.

01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:05.933
It was kind of weird.

01:31:05.934 --> 01:31:09.035
I've, responded
to several calls.

01:31:09.037 --> 01:31:11.204
Every time I went there,

01:31:11.206 --> 01:31:13.339
he was just out of control.

01:31:13.341 --> 01:31:15.476
The neighbors were
always complaining.

01:31:15.477 --> 01:31:18.044
He was always
yelling and screaming.

01:31:18.046 --> 01:31:21.214
Seems like a very
violent man and I just...

01:31:21.216 --> 01:31:23.750
I think it's good that we get
him out of the neighborhood.

01:31:23.751 --> 01:31:26.419
He lost my shoe.
It's unbelievable.

01:31:26.421 --> 01:31:27.721
I came in,

01:31:27.722 --> 01:31:31.024
dropped off a pair of Manolos
for him to fix a button.

01:31:31.025 --> 01:31:32.693
How simple is that?

01:31:32.694 --> 01:31:34.161
Fixing a button.

01:31:34.162 --> 01:31:37.363
And, so, after weeks of
not hearing from the guy,

01:31:37.365 --> 01:31:40.132
I go and I call him up,
and he tells me,

01:31:40.134 --> 01:31:42.969
"I misplaced your shoe."

01:31:42.971 --> 01:31:45.371
Misplaced my shoe?
Excuse me?

01:31:45.373 --> 01:31:46.907
I think he's great.

01:31:46.908 --> 01:31:48.442
I mean, he's always
so nice to me.

01:31:48.443 --> 01:31:50.410
And whenever I see him
in the neighborhood,

01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:51.979
he's just hanging
out with his daughter

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.380
and having a great time.

01:31:53.381 --> 01:31:56.131
I'm actually shocked
about this whole thing.

01:33:58.705 --> 01:34:00.705
I won't be hypnotized
