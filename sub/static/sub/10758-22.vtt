WEBVTT

00:08.186 --> 00:10.063
- Good show today, Roz.
- Yeah.

00:10.230 --> 00:14.151
- Say, why all the catalogues?
- I need to buy a present.

00:14.317 --> 00:18.196
Tiffany, Cartier, Neiman Marcus...

00:18.363 --> 00:20.907
- Anything look good to you here?
- Well, let's see.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.369
Who could we be shopping for?

00:24.536 --> 00:27.122
Perhaps a honey-voiced
radio therapist

00:27.289 --> 00:30.041
whose birthday's
just around the corner?

00:30.208 --> 00:32.460
No, this present is not for you.
It's for your brother.

00:32.668 --> 00:34.671
Oh, all right, Roz, listen,
don't be coy.

00:34.838 --> 00:37.215
I think it's very smart,
your fishing for hints like this.

00:37.382 --> 00:39.718
You want to avoid a misstep
like you made last year.

00:39.884 --> 00:42.178
<i>What misstep?
You said you loved Pagliacci.</i>

00:42.387 --> 00:46.308
Yes, the opera, not the little
porcelain crying clown figurine.

00:46.683 --> 00:48.184
Look, Niles pulled some strings

00:48.351 --> 00:50.437
and got Alice on a list
for a really good preschool

00:50.645 --> 00:52.439
so I thought I'd get him
a thank-you gift.

00:52.647 --> 00:55.358
That's why I was asking for your
stupid opinion in the first place.

00:55.525 --> 00:56.943
- But forget it.
- All right, fine.

00:57.110 --> 00:59.612
- I'll figure it out for myself.
- Have it your own way. Fine.

00:59.779 --> 01:02.949
But I tell you what, don't get him
a porcelain Pagliacci.

01:03.116 --> 01:05.577
He already has one.

01:11.708 --> 01:13.084
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

01:13.251 --> 01:14.627
You'll never guess who I just saw.

01:14.794 --> 01:16.588
I went over for a cup of coffee
with Hank.

01:16.754 --> 01:17.797
You remember Hank?

01:17.964 --> 01:20.550
He's the security guard who works
at Weston's Jewellery Store.

01:20.717 --> 01:22.427
Anyway, we were in his booth,

01:22.593 --> 01:25.430
just shooting the breeze and looking
at the surveillance monitors,

01:25.596 --> 01:28.933
and who do I see buying
an engagement ring but Donny.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.185
As in Daphne and Donny.

01:31.394 --> 01:32.437
Donny?

01:32.603 --> 01:34.147
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:34.355 --> 01:38.985
Engagement rings is Tina's counter.
We use the zoom lens on her.

01:39.193 --> 01:41.612
- Dad, I'm shocked.
- Oh, no, it's just innocent fun.

01:41.779 --> 01:45.283
She only dresses that way because
she knows we're looking at her.

01:45.491 --> 01:48.369
I mean about Daphne and Donny.
I didn't realize they were this serious.

01:48.536 --> 01:51.414
- They spend all that time together.
- This is gonna crush Niles.

01:51.581 --> 01:54.041
- Yeah, I know.
- Do you think we should tell him?

01:54.250 --> 01:56.335
No, it's none of our business.
We do not tell Niles

01:56.502 --> 01:58.879
and we definitely do not tell Daphne.

01:59.088 --> 02:01.340
- Tell Daphne what?
- Nothing.

02:01.549 --> 02:03.676
- It's bad news, isn't it?
- No, it's not bad news.

02:03.884 --> 02:06.470
Is it about my mum? Did they find
something during her physical?

02:06.637 --> 02:08.305
They did, didn't they?
I have to call her.

02:08.472 --> 02:11.517
No, Daphne, no, no, no.
There is absolutely no news.

02:11.684 --> 02:14.687
And even if there were,
it's not up to us to tell you about it.

02:14.895 --> 02:15.938
Who should tell me, then?

02:16.105 --> 02:17.439
Head surgeon?
Our family minister?

02:17.648 --> 02:18.691
- No!
- No!

02:18.858 --> 02:21.485
The mortician? God, I've gotta pack.
I hope I'm not too late.

02:21.652 --> 02:24.405
I just saw Donny
buying you an engagement ring.

02:24.613 --> 02:26.115
That is the news.

02:26.448 --> 02:27.575
Really?

02:28.284 --> 02:29.910
I don't believe it.

02:30.077 --> 02:32.788
I'm gonna get married.
God, I'm so excited.

02:32.997 --> 02:35.666
I'm gonna be a missus.
Mrs. Donny Douglas.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.211
Mrs. Donald Ronald Douglas.
Oh, God!

02:40.337 --> 02:43.340
Yes, well, I guess we're
gonna have to prepare Niles now.

02:43.507 --> 02:46.552
- He's on his way over here.
- Yeah, well, don't tell him here.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.179
I don't want him going to pieces
in front of Daphne.

02:49.346 --> 02:51.181
Yes, I guess I can tell him
at the restaurant.

02:51.348 --> 02:54.226
Well, just don't take him
to one of those fancy wine bistros

02:54.393 --> 02:55.561
that you guys love.

02:55.769 --> 02:59.606
News like this calls for
hard liquor in big glasses.

03:01.316 --> 03:03.986
Wherever it is, I just think
it's best that Niles hear it from me

03:04.194 --> 03:07.030
- and not from Daphne.
- Hear what from Daphne?

03:09.449 --> 03:10.909
I'll tell you at the restaurant.

03:11.118 --> 03:13.120
No, I don't wanna wait
till we get to the bistro.

03:13.287 --> 03:17.040
- You're just gonna have to wait.
- And you're not going to any bistro.

03:19.418 --> 03:22.129
Well, fine. If you won't tell me,
then I'll just ask Daphne myself.

03:22.295 --> 03:25.006
Niles, wait. The truth is...

03:26.716 --> 03:29.719
- Daphne's...
- Mother is dying.

03:32.556 --> 03:34.850
- Dear God.
- Yes, tragic, isn't it?

03:35.016 --> 03:36.142
Yes.

03:36.351 --> 03:38.562
She's gonna need all the support
that we can give her.

03:38.979 --> 03:40.021
Evening, Dr. Crane.

03:40.188 --> 03:42.065
Come on, Niles,
we don't wanna lose our table.

03:42.774 --> 03:46.778
- Did you hear the news?
- I just did. What can I say?

03:49.698 --> 03:52.450
I've thought about this day
ever since I was a little girl.

03:52.659 --> 03:53.702
I'm sure you have.

03:53.868 --> 03:56.996
It's even better
than I thought it would be.

03:58.289 --> 04:00.375
I can already picture the big day.

04:00.542 --> 04:03.670
Beautiful flowers everywhere,

04:03.878 --> 04:05.922
a sea of smiling faces.

04:06.423 --> 04:08.675
I suppose everyone
will want to have their picture taken

04:08.842 --> 04:11.094
with the lady of the hour.

04:13.763 --> 04:17.517
You know, maybe Daphne
could use a little quiet time.

04:17.725 --> 04:22.563
No, who could be quiet? I'm so happy.
Donny's gonna ask me to marry him.

04:23.439 --> 04:25.275
- What?
- Now, come the big day,

04:25.441 --> 04:27.277
you'll all sit right up front
with my family

04:27.443 --> 04:29.696
because that's
what you are to me. Family.

04:29.904 --> 04:31.990
Well, that's what you are
to us too, Daph.

04:32.156 --> 04:34.951
Oh, I am so thrilled for you.

04:35.159 --> 04:38.746
Oh, thank you. Thank you, all.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.835
I'm sorry, son.

04:46.045 --> 04:47.213
- You wanna talk?
- No.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.924
Frasier, if you wouldn't mind,
I'm gonna cancel dinner.

04:50.091 --> 04:53.386
- I need to be alone.
- Of course, Niles.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.679
Look, if you need me, call.

04:58.057 --> 04:59.267
Poor kid.

05:00.184 --> 05:01.227
He'll be all right, Dad.

05:01.394 --> 05:05.856
You know, Niles is a lot stronger
than we give him credit for.

05:08.901 --> 05:10.403
Hello?

05:10.778 --> 05:13.280
Hold the elevator. I'll be right there.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.161
Hang in there, son, he's on his way.

05:26.377 --> 05:27.419
Yes?

05:28.295 --> 05:32.883
This came while you were in session.
It's from a Roz Doyle.

05:33.092 --> 05:35.427
She wanted to thank you
for a favour that you did.

05:36.053 --> 05:39.848
- I'll be off now.
- All right. Good night, Mrs. Woodson.

05:44.228 --> 05:45.729
Come in, Mrs. Woodson.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.440
I'm afraid it's me, Dr. Crane.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.026
Daphne. What are you doing here?

05:51.193 --> 05:54.321
I know I should've called first,
but I need to talk to you.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.616
It's sort of a private matter
and I hoped we could talk here.

05:58.117 --> 06:01.620
Well, it's not really appropriate for me
to act as your therapist,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.914
but if it's just advice
from a friend that you need,

06:04.081 --> 06:07.626
I'm happy to lend an ear.
What's on your mind?

06:07.793 --> 06:09.503
Well...

06:10.295 --> 06:13.090
I don't think I can marry Donny.

06:13.257 --> 06:15.592
I think there's someone else
I'm meant to be with.

06:16.635 --> 06:17.719
Who is it?

06:17.928 --> 06:20.973
- It's Mrs...
- Oh, for God's sake, go home!

06:25.018 --> 06:26.311
Sorry for that interruption.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.982
Anyway, this man
you're meant to be with, who is he?

06:31.441 --> 06:33.485
I'm afraid I can't say.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.654
Yes, you can.
We're the only ones here.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.823
Are you sure you won't laugh at me?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.783
How could you think
I would laugh at you?

06:39.950 --> 06:41.284
Most people would if I told them

06:41.451 --> 06:43.620
I'd seen the love of my life
in a psychic vision.

06:43.828 --> 06:46.915
Well, most people are... What?

06:47.457 --> 06:50.794
You know how I have these
psychic flashes from time to time.

06:50.961 --> 06:53.213
Well, I had one last night.

06:53.421 --> 06:55.840
You had a vision about

06:56.007 --> 06:58.885
the love of your life. Okay.

06:59.094 --> 07:02.055
Well, tell me about it. Here.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.349
And, Daphne,

07:04.516 --> 07:06.726
omit nothing.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.395
All right.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.981
I was straightening up the living room
when I had a sudden flash

07:12.148 --> 07:14.734
of a wedding ceremony
for Donny and me.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.069
Oh, it was lovely.

07:16.277 --> 07:18.696
The church was packed
to the rafters.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.574
Me mum was there
in a peach silk looking very smart,

07:21.741 --> 07:23.243
me brothers in their suits...

07:23.409 --> 07:25.078
I may have led you
in the wrong direction

07:25.245 --> 07:27.789
with the omit-nothing business.
Feel free to skip ahead.

07:27.956 --> 07:29.165
Right.

07:29.374 --> 07:32.502
Well, my father had just
walked me up to the altar

07:32.669 --> 07:34.921
and I was standing there
facing Donny.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.174
He looked quite natty.
Black tuxedo, tails, very slender.

07:38.383 --> 07:40.093
We're skipping.

07:42.637 --> 07:45.348
Well, then the vicar
began the ceremony.

07:45.932 --> 07:49.018
He asked if anyone had a reason
why we shouldn't wed

07:49.185 --> 07:51.270
and that's when this...

07:51.896 --> 07:54.482
Well, this person stood up
and said that he did.

07:56.025 --> 07:58.194
He said that
he was the true love of my life,

07:58.361 --> 08:01.697
though he'd never had the courage
to say so.

08:01.864 --> 08:03.783
I feel so awkward telling you all this.

08:03.991 --> 08:06.869
Don't. I think I know
who this person is.

08:07.078 --> 08:08.371
- You do?
- Yes.

08:08.537 --> 08:12.375
Well, I don't see how you could.
I couldn't tell myself.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.920
He was standing in the shadows
and I couldn't see his face.

08:16.128 --> 08:20.508
All I could make out was that
he was wearing a red bow tie.

08:21.509 --> 08:23.385
I don't have

08:24.762 --> 08:27.431
a clue why anyone would wear
such a thing to a wedding.

08:28.557 --> 08:32.937
Heavens, I can't believe I'm talking
about my visions to a psychiatrist.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.647
Your brother would think I was daft.

08:34.813 --> 08:39.693
Well, Frasier's never really shared
my mystical, spiritual bent.

08:41.904 --> 08:45.950
This does mean I'm gonna have
to turn down Donny's proposal.

08:46.575 --> 08:49.953
- You don't think that would be crazy?
- Not at all.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.498
Then you really believe
in psychic visions too?

08:52.665 --> 08:54.249
I do.

08:54.416 --> 08:57.878
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
That means a lot to me.

08:58.587 --> 09:03.383
Of course, if I can't marry Donny,
I can't very well go on dating him.

09:03.550 --> 09:07.721
- That would just be leading him on.
- That's very true.

09:07.930 --> 09:10.474
I don't know how
I'm gonna break it off with him.

09:10.641 --> 09:15.979
Well, do you wanna write a letter?
I have stationery and a fax machine.

09:16.855 --> 09:20.609
No. I have to tell him to his face.

09:21.485 --> 09:23.654
I do hate to let him go, though.

09:23.862 --> 09:26.490
I know it's hard,
but it's the only ethical thing to do.

09:27.824 --> 09:29.409
You're right.

09:31.703 --> 09:34.373
Now I see why people come to you.

09:34.581 --> 09:37.459
You always point them
in the right direction.

09:37.626 --> 09:42.297
Well, I'd be a poor excuse
for a psychiatrist if I didn't.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:52.641 --> 09:55.644
- Hello, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

10:01.524 --> 10:02.734
What's Eddie doing?

10:02.942 --> 10:04.444
Every time this cooking show
comes on,

10:04.611 --> 10:07.530
he rolls over and watches it
upside-down.

10:07.697 --> 10:09.282
He likes all the pouring they do.

10:09.449 --> 10:13.078
He thinks it's funny the way
the food goes up instead of down.

10:16.915 --> 10:19.000
- Evening.
- Hey, Daph.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.795
Donny called,
said he'd be here about 8.

10:21.961 --> 10:23.880
Do you think he'll pop
the question tonight?

10:24.088 --> 10:25.340
I hope not.

10:26.299 --> 10:27.342
What's the matter?

10:27.842 --> 10:29.719
I've decided to break up
with him tonight.

10:29.886 --> 10:32.472
What? You wanted
to marry him yesterday.

10:32.972 --> 10:36.017
Well, you know how I have
these visions from time to time.

10:36.184 --> 10:39.771
- And don't tell Dr. Crane. Well...
- Don't tell me what?

10:40.772 --> 10:42.690
- Nothing.
- It's my car again, isn't it?

10:42.899 --> 10:44.650
It's not your bloody car.

10:44.859 --> 10:46.944
She's breaking up with Donny
because of some vision.

10:47.111 --> 10:49.072
I asked you not to mention that.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.406
What vision?

10:51.074 --> 10:52.492
I know you'll make fun of me.

10:52.658 --> 10:55.328
But I had a vision that
I'm meant to be with another man.

10:55.536 --> 10:57.497
- Who?
- I couldn't see his face.

10:57.663 --> 11:01.584
I don't know anything about him.
He was just wearing a red bow tie.

11:02.126 --> 11:05.046
You're seriously gonna dump Donny
because of some psychic vision?

11:05.213 --> 11:07.590
Don't you think that's a little unwise?

11:07.798 --> 11:09.759
Well, your brother didn't think so.

11:11.802 --> 11:14.138
- Niles knows about this?
- Yes.

11:14.305 --> 11:17.725
He helped me to see that ending
things with Donny was my only choice.

11:17.892 --> 11:20.186
Unlike you,
he believes in my visions.

11:20.394 --> 11:22.813
He knows I have a gift.

11:23.647 --> 11:27.568
Yes. He's been trying to unwrap it
for six years.

11:34.241 --> 11:35.284
That'll be Donny.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.828
What do you think
about all this vision stuff?

11:38.037 --> 11:41.332
There's some psychological reason
that she's having second thoughts.

11:41.498 --> 11:45.044
It's got nothing to do
with an apparition in a red bow tie.

11:51.884 --> 11:54.178
Niles, you jackass,
will you take that thing off?

11:58.766 --> 12:01.477
I admit it's a departure for me,
but I'm feeling a bit kicky today.

12:01.643 --> 12:03.270
Yes, I know.

12:03.479 --> 12:06.732
Daphne told us you encouraged her to
follow her vision and to dump Donny.

12:06.940 --> 12:11.195
I'm astonished at your lack of integrity.
Now, will you take that damn thing off?

12:11.403 --> 12:13.071
What did you hope
to accomplish with that?

12:13.238 --> 12:15.657
I was simply trying to nudge Daphne
into the realisation

12:15.824 --> 12:17.159
that I am the man in her vision.

12:17.326 --> 12:18.368
Niles.

12:18.577 --> 12:21.288
All right. But why else
would she come to me?

12:21.496 --> 12:24.499
Surely, you of all people realise
that there is some psychological basis

12:24.666 --> 12:26.418
for these visions of hers.

12:26.710 --> 12:29.504
It represents a fear of some kind.

12:29.713 --> 12:31.923
A fear of intimacy,
a fear of commitment,

12:32.090 --> 12:35.302
a fear of the Windsor knot.
Who knows?

12:37.095 --> 12:40.849
- Wasn't that Donny at the door?
- No, no, just Niles, Daphne.

12:41.016 --> 12:44.770
You know, we were just discussing
these visions of yours.

12:44.978 --> 12:46.938
Look, I'm in no mood to be mocked.

12:47.606 --> 12:49.900
I'm not mocking you, Daphne.

12:50.066 --> 12:52.861
And I'm not trying to influence you
in any way either.

12:53.028 --> 12:55.989
It's just that I was wondering...

12:56.198 --> 12:59.409
Have these psychic warnings
ever come to you before?

12:59.576 --> 13:03.204
Say, at a critical juncture
in a relationship.

13:03.413 --> 13:04.956
No.

13:05.749 --> 13:07.375
Well, actually, yes.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.544
Once when my first boyfriend
proposed,

13:09.711 --> 13:12.088
I had a vision telling me
there was someone better waiting,

13:12.255 --> 13:13.840
which there was, Clyde.

13:14.049 --> 13:15.175
But you dumped Clyde.

13:15.383 --> 13:18.595
Look, I don't have time
for this right now.

13:19.387 --> 13:22.474
Oh, yes,
no fear of commitment there.

13:22.682 --> 13:26.060
Well, it's just as possible that she
knew those men were wrong for her.

13:26.227 --> 13:28.146
- Isn't that right, Dad?
- Leave me out of this.

13:28.313 --> 13:31.608
<i>- I'm just looking for my TV Guide.
- Well, I could use a little support here.</i>

13:31.816 --> 13:34.110
Well, maybe that's why I said
to leave me out of it.

13:34.611 --> 13:36.696
I'm sorry, Niles.
I want you to be happy,

13:36.863 --> 13:39.824
but I'm with your brother on this.

13:40.033 --> 13:44.203
Niles, the fact is, you don't know
what causes these visions.

13:44.412 --> 13:46.372
And yet you still advised her
to walk away

13:46.539 --> 13:48.833
from a wonderful relationship.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.461
It doesn't make you
much of a psychiatrist.

13:51.878 --> 13:53.046
That's your opinion.

13:53.212 --> 13:55.715
Yes, well, here's a second opinion.

13:55.882 --> 13:58.176
It doesn't make you
much of a friend.

14:03.306 --> 14:05.558
You sure you didn't throw it away
with the recycling?

14:05.725 --> 14:07.894
<i>Are you actually looking
for your TV Guide?</i>

14:08.102 --> 14:10.479
Well, I have to plan my weekend.

14:11.772 --> 14:15.693
You really do have the world
on a string, don't you, Dad?

14:16.569 --> 14:19.780
Look, Daphne, I have been thinking
about our talk this afternoon.

14:19.989 --> 14:23.117
I'm not sure I gave you
the best advice I could have.

14:23.326 --> 14:25.536
Perhaps what you call a vision

14:25.745 --> 14:28.914
is really a fear,
a fear of commitment, say.

14:29.081 --> 14:30.833
That would explain
why these visions

14:31.584 --> 14:34.295
come to you
when your relationships turn serious.

14:34.795 --> 14:40.217
Mind you, I can't tell you that I think
Donny is the right person for you,

14:40.426 --> 14:46.307
but I wouldn't want you to end things
with him for the wrong reasons.

14:47.766 --> 14:50.728
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

14:51.061 --> 14:53.355
You're just like your brother after all.

14:53.522 --> 14:55.899
This afternoon you were just
humouring me, weren't you?

14:56.066 --> 14:58.444
- No, Daphne.
- Look at the idiot from Manchester.

14:58.652 --> 14:59.737
She thinks she has visions.

14:59.903 --> 15:02.865
No, no. I'm saying that I think
there are psychological issues here

15:03.073 --> 15:04.867
that you just don't entirely appreciate.

15:05.075 --> 15:08.454
Well, how could I?
I'm just some nut who believes in fate.

15:08.620 --> 15:13.292
Well, I've always followed my vision
and your pity's not gonna change that.

15:13.876 --> 15:16.336
That'll be Donny.
Could one of you get the door?

15:18.213 --> 15:19.798
Well, you've seen me do it
enough times.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.800
You just turn the handle and pull.

15:27.848 --> 15:29.725
- Hello, Donny.
- Hi, Frasier.

15:29.933 --> 15:31.727
- Hey.
- Is Daphne ready?

15:31.893 --> 15:35.063
- She'll be out in a minute.
- That's good. Great.

15:35.230 --> 15:37.190
- What's that you're drinking there?
- Sherry.

15:37.357 --> 15:39.860
Yeah, I'll have one.

15:40.027 --> 15:42.029
So how's business?

15:42.195 --> 15:43.947
Well, actually,
I've cut down on my caseload

15:44.114 --> 15:45.991
because I wanna spend more time
with Daphne.

15:46.199 --> 15:50.078
Don't tell her this, but I've book us
on an Alaskan vacation next month.

15:50.245 --> 15:54.249
I hear it's one of the few places left
where you can feel completely alone.

15:54.749 --> 15:57.210
You like that feeling, huh?

16:02.382 --> 16:05.510
- Donny.
- Oh, hi, honey.

16:08.763 --> 16:11.391
- You look really great.
- You too.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.767
Shall we be on our way, then?

16:12.934 --> 16:15.520
Well, actually,
I've got something on my mind

16:15.687 --> 16:18.064
that I'd kind of like to talk about first.

16:18.273 --> 16:20.734
- Oh, well, we'll just get out of here.
- No, no, no, it's...

16:20.900 --> 16:22.736
I'd like you to stay here for this.

16:22.944 --> 16:26.030
If it wasn't for all of you,
then I never would have met Daphne.

16:26.239 --> 16:28.992
- Donny, I think it'd be best if...
- It's okay. Sit.

16:33.621 --> 16:37.250
Maybe I'll just have
a little bit of this sherry.

16:40.169 --> 16:42.422
You know, I thought
that being a divorce attorney

16:42.589 --> 16:44.340
would've just soured me
on relationships,

16:44.507 --> 16:47.093
and then I met you.

16:47.302 --> 16:48.595
And now I find myself

16:48.803 --> 16:50.930
telling my clients to reconcile,

16:51.097 --> 16:54.392
because I think that if they could find
even just a tiny little bit

16:54.559 --> 16:57.270
of the happiness
that I've found with you,

16:57.437 --> 16:58.813
they could make it.

16:59.856 --> 17:01.399
I've been thinking about that time

17:01.607 --> 17:03.860
we went to the little bed-
and-breakfast in the country,

17:04.026 --> 17:06.779
and we sat in that porch swing
all night

17:07.530 --> 17:09.281
and looked at the sky.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.867
You told me that your dad and you
used to sit on your stoop

17:12.034 --> 17:13.703
and do the same thing
when you were a kid.

17:13.869 --> 17:18.207
He said that the only man
good enough for you

17:18.374 --> 17:22.377
would scoop the stars
out of the sky with his hat

17:23.170 --> 17:25.298
and lay them at your feet.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.217
Well...

17:30.052 --> 17:31.804
I've...

17:33.264 --> 17:36.183
I've only caught this one so far,

17:36.642 --> 17:38.436
but if you'll accept it,

17:38.602 --> 17:42.148
I'll spend my life chasing down
the rest of them for you.

17:43.607 --> 17:45.276
I know it's very soon,

17:45.818 --> 17:48.154
so just think about it.

17:49.780 --> 17:52.741
I don't have to think about it.

17:53.117 --> 17:56.495
Yes. Oh, God, it's beautiful.

17:57.162 --> 17:59.498
Oh, Donny. Oh, God.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.960
Thank you.

18:03.168 --> 18:05.504
Boys, give me a break.
You look more surprised than I do.

18:05.713 --> 18:07.131
No, no.

18:07.297 --> 18:08.716
No.

18:08.882 --> 18:10.718
We're just so happy for you.

18:10.926 --> 18:14.096
- Congratulations.
- Yes, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.

18:14.304 --> 18:15.931
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:16.098 --> 18:20.686
- If you'll excuse me, I need to...
- Yes, champagne. Let me help you.

18:23.147 --> 18:24.815
Oh, Niles.

18:24.982 --> 18:27.234
I'm so sorry.

18:30.904 --> 18:35.492
Frasier, why don't you take
the champagne in there?

18:35.826 --> 18:37.452
We're gonna stay out here
for a second.

18:37.619 --> 18:39.413
All right.

18:42.457 --> 18:44.668
I'd do anything to fix this for you.

18:44.876 --> 18:46.753
I know.

18:47.879 --> 18:49.464
It's my own fault.

18:49.631 --> 18:52.175
I had chance after chance
to tell her how I feel,

18:52.342 --> 18:55.470
and I always kept my mouth shut.

18:55.637 --> 18:58.723
Until tonight,
when I probably should have.

18:58.932 --> 19:02.769
Well, you can't regret what you said.
It was the right thing to do.

19:02.936 --> 19:06.398
And that's something
I can always count on from you.

19:07.983 --> 19:09.734
Thanks, Dad.

19:12.112 --> 19:13.780
I'm gonna get you
some of that champagne.

19:13.947 --> 19:17.242
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Oh, just a second, Dr. Crane.

19:18.910 --> 19:21.538
I'm sorry I got cross with you.

19:22.038 --> 19:25.375
Once I thought about what you said,
it really made sense.

19:25.542 --> 19:30.380
And then when Donny did ask me,
it was fear I felt, just like you told me.

19:30.547 --> 19:35.510
I figured the best way to overcome it
was to just jump in with both feet.

19:35.969 --> 19:37.011
Thank you for your help.

19:41.766 --> 19:45.061
- I wish you the very best, Daphne.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't squeeze so hard.

19:45.228 --> 19:47.272
That's a precious commodity
right there.

19:47.438 --> 19:51.109
My number one client here,
you know.

19:55.863 --> 20:00.660
<i>- Still looking for that TV Guide?
- Yeah, it's the damnedest thing.</i>

20:00.952 --> 20:02.912
What are you still doing up?
Where's Donny?

20:03.079 --> 20:05.623
He's on the phone with my folks.

20:05.832 --> 20:07.792
He really is wonderful, Mr. Crane.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.711
I'm very happy for you, Daph.

20:14.257 --> 20:15.550
Oh, my God.

20:16.509 --> 20:18.469
I just had that vision again.

20:18.678 --> 20:20.471
Only this time...

20:20.638 --> 20:22.640
Oh, that's a bit scary.

20:22.807 --> 20:25.977
My mystery man is standing
with some sort of dragon.

20:26.602 --> 20:28.479
- A dragon?
- Yes.

20:28.688 --> 20:31.983
That makes no sense.
It must be just what Dr. Crane said.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.986
- These visions are about my fears.
- I guess.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.321
Imagine spending the rest of my life

20:37.488 --> 20:40.783
looking for some poor bloke
with a dragon.

20:45.621 --> 20:48.332
- That's weird.
- What?

20:48.499 --> 20:50.501
I just had a vision myself.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.044
What is it?

20:52.253 --> 20:54.588
There's a mystery woman.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.258
She's standing in the kitchen.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.511
She's making me
a Monte Cristo sandwich.

21:02.221 --> 21:05.808
- Oh, brother.
- No, no, it's just a grilled cheese.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.977
Make it yourself, you lazy old goat.

21:25.244 --> 21:27.955
Oh, Roz.
