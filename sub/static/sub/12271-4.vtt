00:11.960 --> 00:14.895
Dr. Grummons, uh, I was hoping
to get some answers from you.

00:14.980 --> 00:18.199
Your name was on a list of
expert witnesses my father used.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.201
I am an authority in the field

00:20.235 --> 00:23.037
of social psychology.
Well...

00:23.071 --> 00:26.323
one of his cases involved
The Flock of the Grey Shepherd.

00:26.408 --> 00:28.209
Well, I-I was up all night
going through his files,

00:28.243 --> 00:31.495
and-and the only connection I
have to the case is with you.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.749
And-and this photo.

00:39.838 --> 00:42.089
Ryan, psychology joke--
check it out.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.975
Who am I?

00:45.060 --> 00:46.927
Does that look familiar?

00:47.012 --> 00:48.562
What's your dog's name?

00:48.597 --> 00:50.064
Wilfred.

00:50.098 --> 00:52.433
Come on, Ryan, guess.

00:52.517 --> 00:55.603
Uh, if you have any information
at all about the case...

00:58.907 --> 01:01.942
Your dog looks like
he could use some water.

01:04.613 --> 01:06.530
A special needs kid
who likes bells?

01:06.615 --> 01:09.617
You didn't even try.

01:09.701 --> 01:12.703
Notice how he kept
avoiding my questions?

01:12.788 --> 01:15.673
He's hiding something.
Like what?

01:15.757 --> 01:17.458
Maybe he's connected
to the cult somehow.

01:17.509 --> 01:19.627
Maybe he's covering up for them.

01:19.678 --> 01:21.178
Ryan, you're jumping
to conclusions.

01:21.263 --> 01:22.880
Well, he's got
to know something.

01:22.964 --> 01:25.084
I searched through every box
in my dad's storage unit.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.180
Except for this witness list,
there was nothing there

01:27.219 --> 01:29.687
but old tax forms and
a disturbing amount

01:29.771 --> 01:30.971
of interracial porn.

01:31.056 --> 01:33.774
Such an alert

01:33.809 --> 01:35.192
and intelligent dog.

01:37.112 --> 01:38.779
You know?

01:38.814 --> 01:41.398
My institute is running

01:41.483 --> 01:45.286
a research project
involving dogs.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.654
That's interesting.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.906
So, Dr. Grummons,

01:48.990 --> 01:50.908
The Flock of the Grey Shepherd?

01:50.992 --> 01:53.377
Yes. Now that you mention it,
it does ring a bell.

01:56.965 --> 01:58.582
That was weird.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.551
This is a statue of

02:00.635 --> 02:03.003
the dog god Mataman.

02:03.054 --> 02:04.672
Yes, that's right.

02:04.756 --> 02:07.675
Well, I'm happy to tell you
everything I know, but...

02:07.759 --> 02:09.727
first I need you
and your fascinating dog

02:09.811 --> 02:11.061
to do something for me.

02:13.515 --> 02:15.182
No way!

02:15.233 --> 02:16.984
I'm not gonna be part of
any research project.

02:17.018 --> 02:18.652
Why not?

02:18.687 --> 02:21.021
Because I'm against
animal experimentation.

02:21.106 --> 02:22.573
Wilfred, this is for science.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.325
They're studying
animal behavior.

02:24.359 --> 02:25.359
Come on, this could be
my only chance

02:25.443 --> 02:27.027
to find out about the cult.

02:27.112 --> 02:28.495
I am not a lab rat.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.080
I'm not even a lab.

02:30.165 --> 02:31.749
Just forget about it.

02:31.833 --> 02:34.034
You don't want me
to find answers, do you?

02:34.119 --> 02:36.203
Oh, here we go.
Why are you trying

02:36.254 --> 02:38.088
to keep me from
learning the truth?

02:38.173 --> 02:39.423
Uh, obviously because

02:39.507 --> 02:41.425
I'm out to ruin your life.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.961
Jesus, why are you so paranoid?

02:44.045 --> 02:46.547
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because time and again

02:46.631 --> 02:48.265
you've proven
that I can't trust you.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.551
Or maybe because my own father
hired my roommate

02:50.635 --> 02:54.104
to spy on me and put cameras
in my house and had me followed?

02:54.189 --> 02:55.439
He had you followed?

02:55.523 --> 02:56.891
Well, how else
could he have known

02:56.975 --> 02:59.526
I was hanging out
with you the night he died?

02:59.561 --> 03:02.730
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

03:02.781 --> 03:04.949
All right, look, you've got
a point about your dad,

03:05.033 --> 03:07.701
and I want answers, too,
it's just there's something

03:07.736 --> 03:10.287
off about this whole experiment.

03:10.372 --> 03:13.741
I mean, come on, you show up
in his office with a dog,

03:13.792 --> 03:16.160
and he, coincidentally,
needs dogs for a study

03:16.244 --> 03:17.411
he just happens to be doing?

03:17.462 --> 03:18.746
It's a little too perfect.

03:18.797 --> 03:21.215
Oh. Now who's being paranoid?

03:21.249 --> 03:23.000
Dr. Grummons
wants to study you

03:23.084 --> 03:24.134
because he thinks you're smart.

03:24.219 --> 03:25.586
He's a brilliant psychologist.

03:25.670 --> 03:26.630
You should be flattered.

03:28.473 --> 03:30.724
He thinks I'm smart
and attractive, huh?

03:30.759 --> 03:32.927
Sure.

03:32.978 --> 03:36.647
I... I haven't had
a chance to read all this.

03:36.731 --> 03:38.933
They're just
standard release forms.

03:38.984 --> 03:41.352
I changed my mind, Ryan.
I don't want to do this anymore.

03:41.436 --> 03:42.987
I've got to get out of here.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.491
Wilfred! Stop that!

03:47.575 --> 03:50.077
He's a little agitated today.

03:50.111 --> 03:52.279
Maybe we could just
talk about the cult,

03:52.330 --> 03:54.114
and I could bring
him back next week?

03:54.199 --> 03:55.950
Today is just fine.

04:01.122 --> 04:02.506
Calm down.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.625
I have a bad feeling
about this, Ryan.

04:04.676 --> 04:07.127
I won't let them hurt you.
Just relax.

04:07.212 --> 04:09.546
Ryan, do you have that

04:09.631 --> 04:12.433
intake questionnaire
I sent you home with yesterday?

04:12.467 --> 04:14.468
I e-mailed it to you last night.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.019
I don't have it.
Can you resend it?

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.399 --> 04:29.316
Hell, yeah!

04:29.367 --> 04:32.736
The boys are back, baby!

04:32.821 --> 04:34.321
I saw you in the car
with the dog.

04:34.372 --> 04:35.706
You know I saw you.

04:37.659 --> 04:40.627
This is one more
signature I need.

04:40.662 --> 04:43.580
It acknowledges that in this

04:43.665 --> 04:46.917
experiment we use
negative stimulus.

04:47.002 --> 04:48.252
"Negative stimulus"?

04:48.336 --> 04:50.971
It can be uncomfortable
for Wilfred.

04:51.006 --> 04:52.673
And maybe even painful.

04:58.263 --> 05:00.514
No problem.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.101
We need to talk.
No. It's okay, Ryan.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.553
Just knowing you're here
makes me feel safe.

05:12.638 --> 05:14.555
I mean, friends look out
for friends, right?

05:16.392 --> 05:18.443
Right.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.529
Unbelievable.

05:23.565 --> 05:27.068
I think you'll find this
most interesting.

05:32.574 --> 05:35.209
Ah. The test begins.

05:35.244 --> 05:37.578
I know, I know this one.

05:37.663 --> 05:39.747
Uh, that's food.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.754
Um, I don't really know
what to do.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.307
This seems kind of simple.
I mean, I-I don't know,

05:49.391 --> 05:51.759
I just sort of thought there'd
be a maze or something.

05:54.430 --> 05:56.931
Uh, okay, um...

05:56.982 --> 05:59.016
just give them
what they paying for.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.770
Where's the food?

06:04.273 --> 06:05.490
Where's the food?

06:05.574 --> 06:08.659
There it is.

06:08.744 --> 06:09.861
Ow!

06:09.945 --> 06:12.363
Oh! What the hell?

06:12.448 --> 06:14.615
Um, I think there's something
wrong with this bowl.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.702
Uh, that looked like it hurt.

06:17.786 --> 06:20.755
It's a small electric shock.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.794
Ow!

06:33.852 --> 06:37.271
Ryan, are you feeling this?

06:37.306 --> 06:39.690
Um, m-maybe we should
turn it down a little.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.809
Would you like us to stop?

06:46.482 --> 06:48.950
No.

06:48.984 --> 06:51.536
No, this is good.

06:51.620 --> 06:55.239
Ow! Ryan! Oh!

06:55.324 --> 06:57.124
The hell with this!

06:57.159 --> 06:59.460
I'm not taking another bite!

07:02.798 --> 07:04.549
Why does this keep happening?!

07:08.804 --> 07:11.422
Uh, m-maybe that's enough.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.724
Hints of salmon!

07:15.511 --> 07:17.011
So good!

07:17.095 --> 07:19.146
Dr. Grummons!

07:19.181 --> 07:20.765
Stop!

07:20.849 --> 07:23.017
I think we're ready
for phase two.

07:26.522 --> 07:28.739
Are you all right, Ryan?

07:28.824 --> 07:30.074
Fine.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.243
Just a little head rush.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.828
Have a seat.

07:33.862 --> 07:36.330
I will confer
with my colleagues.

07:45.707 --> 07:48.009
What the hell, Ryan?!

07:48.043 --> 07:50.261
You lied to me!

07:50.345 --> 07:52.129
I lied to you?

07:52.214 --> 07:53.347
You said you wouldn't

07:53.382 --> 07:55.266
let them hurt me!
No, you

07:55.350 --> 07:56.684
said you were my friend!

07:56.718 --> 07:58.219
I know what you did, Wilfred.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.021
I know about...

08:00.055 --> 08:02.974
What? Wh-What is it?

08:03.058 --> 08:05.560
Those shocks...

08:05.644 --> 08:07.728
they were pretty painful, right?

08:07.813 --> 08:10.281
You're goddamn right they were.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.200
That's strange...

08:13.235 --> 08:16.621
considering the machine
was never even plugged in!

08:18.540 --> 08:20.374
What are you talking about?

08:20.409 --> 08:22.577
Of course, it was.
That shit hurt!

08:22.661 --> 08:24.245
Well, how do you explain this?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.047
Somebody must've unplugged it.

08:26.081 --> 08:27.832
Nobody was ever near the plug.

08:27.916 --> 08:29.717
You've been faking it
the whole time.

08:29.751 --> 08:31.502
And why would I do that?

08:31.587 --> 08:32.669
Because you're up to something.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.589
You're plotting against me.

08:34.673 --> 08:36.557
Do you hear yourself?
Do you hear how crazy you sound?

08:36.592 --> 08:38.392
What's your game?

08:38.427 --> 08:41.145
I've just been tortured
by doctors.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.063
I don't need this.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.917
How did you do that?
Get your hands off me!

09:02.951 --> 09:04.752
How did you open that door?
It was unlatched.

09:04.786 --> 09:06.954
I just pushed it.
No, you opened it.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.706
With your paw.
You can't do that!

09:08.790 --> 09:10.424
What the hell is going on?

09:10.459 --> 09:12.460
All right, all right,
let's just calm down, okay?

09:12.511 --> 09:15.379
Can we, can we please?
Wilfred?

09:15.464 --> 09:17.682
Something very weird
is going on here.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.684
I feel like I'm being watched.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.602
Like I'm the one
who's being studied.

09:21.637 --> 09:22.970
Ryan, I-I'm worried about you.

09:23.055 --> 09:24.722
I-I think your obsession
with this cult

09:24.806 --> 09:26.807
is starting to affect
your judgment.

09:26.892 --> 09:28.976
I-I just need to know
I can trust you.

09:29.061 --> 09:30.361
Of course you can, mate.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.363
I only want what's best for you.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.533
I'm doing this experiment
for you.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.068
Make him
think you really care.

09:37.152 --> 09:38.786
I'd do anything for you.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.658
Thanks, Wilfred.

09:43.742 --> 09:47.161
How could I ever doubt you.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.630
I'd never want
to do anything to hurt you.

09:49.665 --> 09:52.049
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.214
Too much. You're overselling it.

09:57.089 --> 10:00.341
I'm really glad we got
to have this talk, Ryan.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.843
I think they're probably
ready for me now.

10:02.928 --> 10:05.146
We just need to do a quick
evaluation on Wilfred.

10:05.180 --> 10:07.064
If you'd like to come with me,
I've just got

10:07.149 --> 10:08.649
a few more release
forms for you to sign.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.184
More forms? But...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.019
I don't make up the
rules, Mr. Newman.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.991
Sure.

10:17.025 --> 10:19.076
Uh, do you mind if I use
the restroom first?

10:19.161 --> 10:21.362
Of course.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.785
Uh... I, I-think

10:27.869 --> 10:29.954
I can handle this myself.

10:30.038 --> 10:31.338
Right.

10:31.373 --> 10:32.540
I'll wait here.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.147
Ryan!

10:56.231 --> 10:57.982
What are you doing here?

10:58.066 --> 10:59.567
That's how you greet
your emergency contact?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.318
I'm missing Pilates
for this shit.

11:01.403 --> 11:03.738
I-I don't remember listing
an emergency contact.

11:03.789 --> 11:04.789
W-When did
they call you?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.574
They said you were lightheaded.

11:06.658 --> 11:08.325
You do look a little tired.
Come on, let's go home.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.327
Well, I'm not leaving
until I get some answers.

11:10.412 --> 11:12.329
If you're worried about Wilfred,
I talked to Dr. Grummons

11:12.414 --> 11:13.748
and they said they can arrange for
his return when they're done.

11:13.832 --> 11:15.082
Now let's go.
No!

11:20.422 --> 11:21.922
You had to make this hard!

11:22.007 --> 11:23.140
You always have
to make everything

11:23.225 --> 11:24.258
so goddamn hard!

11:24.342 --> 11:26.260
Wait, what-what are you doing!?

11:26.344 --> 11:28.763
Don't worry. You're not gonna
remember any of this.

11:30.682 --> 11:31.899
No!

11:31.933 --> 11:33.067
Oh, God...

11:33.101 --> 11:35.069
You little shit...

11:37.105 --> 11:38.105
What...?

12:56.120 --> 12:57.069
...be so stupid?

12:57.154 --> 12:58.488
Hey, none of this

12:58.539 --> 12:59.860
would have happened
if they hadn't

12:59.907 --> 13:01.124
left that goddamn
machine unplugged.

13:01.158 --> 13:02.542
Don't try to deflect.

13:02.626 --> 13:04.386
This is your screw-up
and everybody knows it.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.159
Give me a break.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.660
You only have to spend, like,

13:07.745 --> 13:08.912
five minutes a day
with that asshole.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.297
I'm around him all the time.

13:11.299 --> 13:12.549
It's a miracle I haven't
slipped up until now.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.083
Well, your little
slip-up could ruin

13:14.168 --> 13:15.251
everything we've worked for.
I'll fix it.

13:15.302 --> 13:16.753
You better.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.574
You know what's at stake here.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.609
You fat piece of shit.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.944
It's over.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.732
Shit!

14:21.118 --> 14:22.201
Code gray!

14:23.454 --> 14:24.487
Code gray!

14:38.969 --> 14:40.169
He went this way!

14:51.015 --> 14:52.482
We have a security breach!

14:52.516 --> 14:53.566
Lock the doors!

14:58.939 --> 15:00.023
You don't see him?

15:04.161 --> 15:05.495
Lock down the facility.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.163
Lock down the facility.

16:06.473 --> 16:07.807
Ryan!

16:07.891 --> 16:10.093
Ryan, can you hear me?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.096
Lock down the facility...

16:13.180 --> 16:15.431
Listen very carefully, Ryan.

16:15.482 --> 16:16.682
Who are you?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.267
You were right.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.653
I'm not the real subject
of this experiment.

16:20.738 --> 16:22.238
You are.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.608
They put a drug
in that water you drank.

16:25.659 --> 16:28.911
It causes paranoia
and hallucinations.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.696
You're just saying that
to keep me from the real truth.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.749
That's the paranoia part.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.063
Why is there a mouth
on your paw?

16:34.084 --> 16:36.919
That's the hallucinations part.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.371
None of this is real.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.923
Turn the alarm off.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.208
How?

16:42.292 --> 16:44.927
Just... turn it off.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.768
I'm gonna get you
through this, mate.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.220
But I need you to trust me.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.555
Trust you?

16:55.639 --> 16:56.839
You sent that photo to my dad.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.141
You know about that?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.942
You ruined my
relationship with him.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.644
You baited him and
covered your tracks.

17:01.695 --> 17:04.363
You lined everything up that day so he'd die!
Ryan,

17:04.448 --> 17:05.982
how could I have known...

17:06.066 --> 17:07.316
any of that was gonna happen?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.117
The car? The accident?

17:09.153 --> 17:11.871
What, so you just messed
with my life for no reason?

17:11.954 --> 17:14.656
I sent it because I was afraid.

17:14.708 --> 17:18.544
Of what?
Of you abandoning me.

17:18.628 --> 17:19.829
When your father
was in your life,

17:19.913 --> 17:20.997
you treated me like

17:21.048 --> 17:22.832
I was the neighbor's stupid dog.

17:22.883 --> 17:24.584
I thought, if he threatens
to commit you again,

17:24.667 --> 17:27.837
you and I would run away
together, like we'd planned.

17:27.887 --> 17:30.006
I'm your friend, Ryan.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.341
I only wanted us to be together.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.509
<i>Ryan?</i>

17:33.594 --> 17:34.644
<i>Ryan...</i>

17:34.678 --> 17:36.179
Ryan. Hey.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.516
I'm gonna sue the
shit out of you.

17:40.567 --> 17:42.852
You signed a release.

17:42.903 --> 17:44.270
Why did you do this to me?

17:44.354 --> 17:45.688
We're developing

17:45.739 --> 17:49.408
this drug for
enhanced interrogation.

17:49.493 --> 17:50.660
Big money in that.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.161
But why me?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.446
Our...

17:53.530 --> 17:55.915
protocol requires us to use

17:55.999 --> 17:59.035
subjects who are under stress,

17:59.119 --> 18:01.170
which you clearly were,

18:01.205 --> 18:03.789
especially when
we shocked your dog.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.758
It all seemed so real.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.543
The idea was to make

18:07.594 --> 18:09.595
your worst fears come true.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.048
Got that idea
from a Batman movie.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.217
Try and get some sleep.

18:14.268 --> 18:16.636
The drug will wear off
in a few hours,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.855
and as soon as you recover,

18:18.889 --> 18:20.940
I will tell you
everything I know

18:21.024 --> 18:24.527
about The Flock
of the Grey Shepherd.

18:29.950 --> 18:33.069
Why do I always assume
the worst about you?

18:33.153 --> 18:36.622
That's a question
for another day.

18:36.707 --> 18:39.742
But you're never gonna find
the answers you're looking for

18:39.826 --> 18:42.828
by racing to
the worst-case scenario.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.213
Isn't that right?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.419
Yeah, yeah, he's right.

18:50.938 --> 18:53.283
Your father defended
the cult leader,

18:53.403 --> 18:56.906
Charles Smith,
on tax fraud charges.

18:56.990 --> 19:00.910
I provided expert testimony
on cult psychology.

19:00.961 --> 19:02.244
Well, why can't I find anything

19:02.329 --> 19:03.609
about the group on the Internet?

19:03.630 --> 19:05.548
The Flock of the Grey Shepherd

19:05.582 --> 19:07.383
was only around for a few years.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.584
Why?

19:08.668 --> 19:10.836
Because it was stupid.

19:10.921 --> 19:13.389
Its central belief was that

19:13.423 --> 19:16.258
a talking dog god

19:16.309 --> 19:19.011
would lead a Chosen One
to happiness.

19:19.096 --> 19:22.231
Absolute rubbish.

19:22.265 --> 19:24.934
And I'm afraid that's all
the information I have.

19:28.271 --> 19:29.238
Just a moment.

19:29.272 --> 19:30.773
Do you remember

19:30.857 --> 19:32.575
the photo we looked
at the other day?

19:33.944 --> 19:36.412
I said that statue was Mataman.

19:36.446 --> 19:38.330
But it could also be Krungel.

19:38.415 --> 19:40.116
Krungel?

19:40.200 --> 19:42.618
That's the other deity
they believed in.

19:42.669 --> 19:44.727
A trickster god.

19:46.790 --> 19:50.593
<i>The Flock believed</i>
<i>in the idea of duality.</i>

19:50.627 --> 19:52.344
<i>Joy and pain.</i>

19:52.429 --> 19:54.263
<i>Good and evil.</i>

19:54.297 --> 19:56.632
<i>Krungel was the opposite</i>
<i>of Mataman.</i>

19:56.683 --> 19:58.884
<i>He was a demon, really.</i>

19:58.969 --> 20:00.219
<i>His goal was to lead people</i>

20:00.303 --> 20:02.471
<i>to complete and utter ruin.</i>

20:02.556 --> 20:05.775
<i>Quite simply, he was out</i>
<i>to destroy their lives.</i>

20:05.809 --> 20:09.945
<i>And he looked exactly...</i>

20:09.980 --> 20:11.530
<i>like Mataman.</i>

20:11.615 --> 20:13.365
<i>How can you tell them apart?</i>

20:13.450 --> 20:14.650
<i>Well, that's just it.</i>

20:14.651 --> 20:17.787
<i>You can't.</i>

20:17.821 --> 20:20.322
<i>Until it's too late.</i>

20:20.373 --> 20:22.541
Done already?

20:22.626 --> 20:24.687
What did you learn?

20:25.629 --> 20:27.496
Nothing we didn't already know.
