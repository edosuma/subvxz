03:11.624 --> 03:13.285
Jane Doe.

03:13.359 --> 03:21.858
Found last night entombed in a tenement wall
by an agent following an anonymous tip.

03:21.968 --> 03:28.373
Time of death, approximately 2100 hours,
from three stab wounds to the abdomen.

03:28.474 --> 03:33.377
Dirt and clay were found
under the nails of her right hand.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.312
What are those lacerations
on her arms and feet?

03:36.382 --> 03:39.545
Predation from rats.

03:39.652 --> 03:44.919
The agent was led to her body
by the sound of their feeding.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.484
Anyone?

03:47.560 --> 03:52.896
She was killed someplace else. She clawed
at the dirt before succumbing to her injuries.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.594
That's possible.

03:55.702 --> 04:00.537
What else would help us lD this victim,
find the killer?

04:03.209 --> 04:06.235
- lt's obvious, isn't it?
- What is?

04:07.847 --> 04:10.441
The chipped nail polish.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.913
The drugstore hair rinse.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.716
This is a single woman, unemployed.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.224
That's why no one's lD'd her.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.591
You found blood alcohol?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.424
Point zero four.

04:24.530 --> 04:28.796
She hooked up with the wrong man in a bar.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.203
He killed her.

04:35.375 --> 04:39.243
- This man has killed before.
- And you know that because...?

04:39.312 --> 04:44.409
That bruise beneath her ribs,
it's from the hilt of a knife.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.946
The killer intended a single blow -

04:49.055 --> 04:55.927
the blade thrusting upward at a 45-degree
angle into the heart, causing death instantly -

04:55.995 --> 04:58.930
but she struggled, so he missed.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.466
Then he got mad.

05:03.936 --> 05:07.463
Like l said - obvious.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.204
Agent Scully?

05:49.015 --> 05:51.108
Great. Thank you.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.043
- You got something?
- Quite a lot.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.179
We've identified your Jane Doe
as Ellen Persich.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.953
- 28, from Redland, Maryland.
- How'd you make the lD so fast?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.861
The bar she was at last night
is half a mile from where another woman,

06:04.964 --> 06:09.731
Rita Shaw, was murdered two weeks ago,
apparently by the same killer.

06:09.836 --> 06:12.327
The body John found was the second victim?

06:12.405 --> 06:17.001
This says that Rita Shaw was found
in a ditch, dead from a single knife wound.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.807
The woman l found was plastered
behind a wall and stabbed three times.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.212
l didn't make the connection at first,

06:23.316 --> 06:27.150
but the lab confirms that it
was the same knife in both killings.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.882
- How did you make the connection?
- l didn't.

06:29.989 --> 06:35.222
But one of my students realized that the killer
only meant to stab Doggett's victim once.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.991
The other wounds were
out of anger because he missed.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.228
- That's a pretty astute observation.
- Amazingly so.

06:42.335 --> 06:46.431
- Does this cadet have any other answers?
- Like what?

06:46.539 --> 06:51.567
l wanna know why someone tipped me off
to this case, cos this isn't an X-File.

06:51.677 --> 06:57.547
l don't know, Agent Doggett, but now that
you've got this case, l'd say run with it.

07:10.563 --> 07:14.090
Cadet Hayes. Rudolph Hayes.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.035
l'm Agent Doggett.
This is Agent Reyes.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.809
ls that part of the training here, Cadet?
Smelling body parts?

07:32.285 --> 07:35.584
This man's flesh smells of creosote,

07:35.655 --> 07:39.887
but his skin is soft, untanned.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.123
He worked indoors,
a hardware store, probably.

07:44.931 --> 07:48.264
The tear marks at his elbow
go from left to right.

07:48.334 --> 07:51.770
He was broadsided in a car accident.

07:51.838 --> 07:56.298
His hands gripped the wheel so hard,
his thumb bone snapped on impact.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.976
You determined all that
just by looking at that arm?

08:05.918 --> 08:09.149
l see things.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.450
We came to thank you.

08:11.524 --> 08:16.427
Because of your analysis, we were able
to work up a profile to catch the murderer.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.990
- What's the profile?
- White male, 25 to 35, ex-military.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.662
Employed near the bars where he met...
Why are you shaking your head?

08:25.771 --> 08:28.467
The profile's wrong.

08:29.775 --> 08:35.543
Your killer is in his forties,
a felon recently arrived from out of state.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.947
His parole officer thinks
he's looking for ajob.

08:39.018 --> 08:43.182
He already has one,
working for organized crime.

08:45.992 --> 08:49.359
He's killed many people.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.196
He's gonna keep on killing.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.566
Kind of annoying, isn't he?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.656
John.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.919
Nicholas Rigali?

10:53.986 --> 10:57.786
l'm Agent Reyes.
This is Agent Doggett.

10:57.857 --> 11:02.021
Don't put 'em away so fast, Agents.
l wanna read 'em.

11:05.097 --> 11:09.033
John J Doggett.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.004
Monica Reyes.

11:14.106 --> 11:18.668
Mr. Rigali, you're in town in violation of
the terms of your parole back in New York.

11:18.778 --> 11:24.341
Call my parole officer.
She'll tell you l'm here looking for work.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.978
You come here often, Mr. Rigali?

11:28.554 --> 11:34.686
Like last night, when Ellen Persich
got murdered in the parking lot out back?

11:34.794 --> 11:40.232
- Last night? l don't remember.
- Maybe you remember being at the Bent Oak.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.563
Bartender says
he saw you there two weeks ago.

11:43.669 --> 11:47.799
Same night a woman named Rita Shaw
got stabbed in the heart.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.639
What do you have to say about that,
Mr. Rigali?

11:54.847 --> 11:59.011
You folks don't know
what you're dealing with.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.922
You don't wanna play this game, flatfoot.
Not with me.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.517
You like to kill women, Mr. Rigali?

12:08.594 --> 12:12.223
You may think you can get away with it
but that's not gonna happen.

12:12.331 --> 12:16.734
Like l said, you really don't know
what you're dealing with.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.231
l think we do.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.606
Agent Doggett,

12:26.712 --> 12:28.771
Agent Reyes.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.379
- How long you been standing there?
- Not long.

14:16.155 --> 14:21.183
l'm glad you dropped by. l wanted
to tell you we hit pay dirt with your profile.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.126
No arrest yet but we're building our case.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.625
There's something else.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.708
There's another case
l'd like you to take a look at.

14:39.812 --> 14:44.806
A seven-year-old boy
rides his bike around the block.

14:44.884 --> 14:49.048
His mom's on the porch counting his laps.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.681
He waves to her every time he goes by,

14:53.759 --> 14:58.560
and after six laps
he doesn't come back around.

15:00.366 --> 15:03.062
She goes looking for him.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.902
She finds his bike lying on the sidewalk.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.578
There's no witnesses.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.718
No ransom demands.

15:20.786 --> 15:25.120
No clue as to who took him or why.

15:25.224 --> 15:29.524
The cops search door to door,
block to block for two days.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.564
Nothing, no news at all.

15:32.631 --> 15:38.194
And after three days, they find him in a field.

15:58.791 --> 16:05.788
lt's all in here.
The particulars about my son.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.660
l've been over this
l don't know how many times.

16:12.438 --> 16:16.602
But after nine years,
there's not a lot to go on.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.803
You were such a big help yesterday.

16:20.913 --> 16:24.576
lf there's anything you see here...

16:24.650 --> 16:29.747
Agent Doggett,
that case l helped you with yesterday?

16:31.857 --> 16:34.587
That is your son's.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.479
What is this?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.643
Unsolved murders.

17:02.388 --> 17:06.790
l started collecting them
before l came to the FBl.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.953
l couldn't tell you why.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.164
What do you do with these?

17:15.233 --> 17:25.371
lf l sit with them for a long time,
very quietly, they tell me things.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.345
That's how l see what l see.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.352
You've been following my son's case.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.918
For a long time.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.889
He calls to me.

17:52.371 --> 17:58.708
Cadet, you should know
there's a real good chance you're nuts.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.240
Do you recognize that man?

18:02.347 --> 18:06.841
lt's Bob Harvey.
lt's the closest we ever had to a suspect.

18:07.386 --> 18:11.789
He died, killed in a car crash
last year in New Orleans.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.923
This man killed my son?

18:16.028 --> 18:19.930
He took him.
He didn't kill him.

18:20.933 --> 18:26.064
Are you saying the same man
that killed those women killed my son?

18:26.705 --> 18:29.071
This guy Rigali?

18:35.147 --> 18:38.947
Assistant Director?
Can l have a minute?

18:39.051 --> 18:42.714
lt's not a good time.
l'm off to a meeting with the director.

18:42.788 --> 18:47.088
- This can't wait.
- And the director can?

18:51.897 --> 18:54.127
OK. You've got one minute.

18:56.635 --> 19:01.595
When you were in New York,
you worked the organized crime task force.

19:01.673 --> 19:05.165
Did you ever hear of
a guy named Nicholas Rigali?

19:05.277 --> 19:11.341
Yeah. He was a collector, a low-level thug.
Why are you asking, Agent Doggett?

19:11.850 --> 19:17.584
When the New York office was investigating
my son's death, his name never came up.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.091
Why would it?

19:22.794 --> 19:26.753
- You believe he was involved?
- l've got no evidence,

19:26.832 --> 19:32.327
but somebody's telling me he's mixed up with
the suspect in my son's case, Bob Harvey.

19:33.338 --> 19:37.172
l never heard that.
And l'm sure l'd remember.

19:47.452 --> 19:51.047
You want me to ask around
and pull some files?

19:56.161 --> 19:58.823
l'll see what l can find.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.865
l'd appreciate it.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.206
John?

20:12.744 --> 20:15.372
- Where you been?
- Chasing down leads.

20:15.480 --> 20:22.215
We were supposed to meet in the office this
morning, to go over what we have on Rigali.

20:30.596 --> 20:34.054
l think this guy Rigali may have been
involved in Luke's death.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.862
What? Since when?

20:36.935 --> 20:40.098
Since l've been talking to Cadet Hayes.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.368
He says Rigali knew Harvey,
they were in on it together.

20:43.442 --> 20:47.776
- How could he possibly know that?
- How does he know half the stuff he knows?

20:47.879 --> 20:49.779
l did some digging.

20:49.881 --> 20:55.217
l found out that Bob Harvey and Rigali
both did time at Wallkill in 1988.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.222
That doesn't mean they knew each other.

20:58.290 --> 21:02.021
l tracked Rigali's credit-card use, Monica.

21:02.094 --> 21:06.963
The day Luke disappeared he gassed
his car up two miles from my house.

21:07.065 --> 21:12.469
Rigali is a New Yorker.
A lot of New Yorkers visit Long lsland.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.900
This is not evidence. Not even close.

21:21.313 --> 21:25.215
l will never know how badly
it hurt you to lose your son,

21:25.284 --> 21:28.583
or how much pain you still carry.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.987
l understand how much
you wanna find his killer.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.726
But l don't wanna see you disappointed.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.888
Not again.

21:39.831 --> 21:44.131
lt's not gonna happen. Not this time.

22:06.358 --> 22:09.327
Hi, Barbara. How you doing?

22:21.206 --> 22:23.333
When'd you get the new furniture?

22:23.442 --> 22:27.503
Last year. Just wanted to make a change.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.473
lt looks great.

22:31.316 --> 22:35.719
- You look great.
- You need to call first, John.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.813
Kinda throws me
when you just show up here.

22:38.890 --> 22:42.348
l'm sorry. lt won't happen again.

22:44.162 --> 22:48.622
- l need to talk to you, Barb.
- lt's about Luke.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.998
- l got a suspect.
- Oh, God, John.

22:51.069 --> 22:54.664
l know, l know.
But this time it's different.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.471
ls it? ''He could be.''
''He might be.''

22:59.978 --> 23:04.847
l wanna find out who did this
just as badly as you do,

23:04.916 --> 23:11.185
but l don't want you coming over here again,
bringing all this up, unless you know.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.218
Unless you absolutely know.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.559
That's what l thought.

23:22.601 --> 23:26.833
This guy may have been cruising
the neighborhood. You could have seen him.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.102
Did you hear anything l said?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.569
Agent Scully?

24:42.647 --> 24:45.013
l'm Barbara. John's ex-wife.

24:45.116 --> 24:49.951
- Hi. l'm Dana. Nice to meet you.
- They said you'd be coming by.

24:50.021 --> 24:55.459
- You couldn't make the identification?
- l didn't expect to.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.262
You know he doesn't think clearly about this.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.666
He can't.

25:04.769 --> 25:09.206
- He blames himself.
- He thinks he failed Luke.

25:09.307 --> 25:14.836
ln his mind, he can never do enough,
never suffer enough for what happened.

25:14.946 --> 25:21.181
l think if you could help him find the man
who did this, maybe he could move on.

25:27.893 --> 25:32.830
He and Monica could have something
together. He just won't let her in.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.134
They're letting him go.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.868
For now.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.837
l'll be at my mom's till tomorrow.

25:53.985 --> 25:56.249
Tell me you got something.

25:56.354 --> 26:02.850
As you asked, l compared the wounds on
your son with the wounds on these women.

26:02.928 --> 26:04.020
And?

26:04.095 --> 26:07.826
There are similarities between
the trajectory of the wounds

26:07.899 --> 26:10.834
and the force with which they were delivered.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.767
Meaning Rigali's the guy.

26:12.871 --> 26:19.276
Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic
deduction on Cadet Hayes's part,

26:19.377 --> 26:21.868
but that's all it is.

26:21.947 --> 26:24.211
The killer used different weapons.

26:24.282 --> 26:29.242
He demonstrated no consistent MO
and no clear victimology.

26:29.354 --> 26:32.721
None of it will hold up in court.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.521
Something out there will.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.803
- Something's not right.
- What do you mean?

28:01.680 --> 28:05.810
This guy's name comes up in connection
with racketeering, prostitution,

28:05.884 --> 28:10.651
drugs, even murder, yet all he's got
are nickel-and-dime convictions.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.657
Always gets off with just a slap on the wrist.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.353
You know Mob cases are hard to build.

28:16.461 --> 28:20.488
What l'm saying is,
l don't think anyone's even trying.

28:20.565 --> 28:24.194
l think this guy Rigali's greasing somebody.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.065
As in bribery?

28:28.173 --> 28:31.199
What else could it be?

28:34.212 --> 28:36.976
What? What is it?

28:43.922 --> 28:46.652
Agents. l was just coming to see you.

28:46.725 --> 28:51.753
We need to talk to you, Assistant Director.
About New York.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.589
Didn't you get the case files?

28:54.699 --> 28:59.898
l mean when we were working in
the New York office. You and me.

29:00.004 --> 29:02.666
l'm not following.

29:05.543 --> 29:10.071
l used to get takeout from a place
on 11th Street, a little hole in the wall.

29:10.181 --> 29:13.912
Maybe you remember it - Carlo's.

29:19.390 --> 29:25.761
ls it me, or is this
becoming an odd conversation?

29:26.197 --> 29:30.395
One night three years ago,
l'm waiting for my order.

29:30.468 --> 29:33.403
l wandered toward the kitchen.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.273
- And l saw you.
- Me?

29:38.376 --> 29:42.073
Talking to a man, a Mob guy.

29:43.882 --> 29:47.909
l saw you take money from him, Brad.
A stack of it.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.146
Three years ago?

29:54.058 --> 29:59.428
So instead of asking me to explain it,
or even reporting me to the Bureau,

29:59.497 --> 30:02.933
you broke off our relationship
and moved away?

30:03.001 --> 30:06.402
l cared about you, Brad.
l'm not defending my actions.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.635
And now you've come here
because you think l'm on the take?

30:12.143 --> 30:15.408
Maybe l was on the take when
Doggett's son was murdered.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.974
Somebody gave Rigali inside help,
covered his role in my son's death.

30:25.790 --> 30:31.456
The man you saw me with was a confidential
informant. l was giving him the money.

30:31.529 --> 30:35.522
- That's not what happened.
- We were buying him to infiltrate a family.

30:35.633 --> 30:38.830
lt's all documented, the entire operation.

30:40.538 --> 30:45.339
Now, l can prove what l'm saying.
Can you?

30:53.685 --> 30:56.518
You should have come to me, Monica.

30:57.989 --> 31:01.117
Especially given what l know now.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.566
What do you know?

31:11.669 --> 31:16.538
When you raised concerns about Rigali,
l looked into the source of these allegations.

31:16.641 --> 31:20.668
- A cadet, right?
- Rudolph Hayes. He's been very helpful.

31:21.179 --> 31:26.674
Rudolph Hayes died in 1978 in a car accident.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.878
What? Let me see that.

31:30.388 --> 31:35.189
Cadet Hayes's real name is Stuart Mimms,
of Mendota, Minnesota.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.492
Last known residence,
the Dakota County psychiatric facility.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.429
He was a mental patient?

31:41.532 --> 31:46.526
Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
Voluntarily institutionalized in 1990.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.937
ln 1992 he checked himself out
and disappeared.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.004
There's another thing.

31:57.081 --> 32:02.951
We can also place him
in New York City in 1993,

32:03.755 --> 32:06.417
the year your son was murdered.

33:33.478 --> 33:36.003
Nice car.

33:36.114 --> 33:42.212
l remember when they had you
banging around in a ten-year-old lmpala.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.380
Now look at ya.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.822
Mr. Assistant Director.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.120
You got lucky.

33:52.397 --> 33:57.994
- He has another suspect.
- You came down here to tell me that?

33:58.803 --> 34:01.897
There's something l need to know.

34:03.574 --> 34:09.012
Were you in any way involved in
the death of John Doggett's son?

34:10.081 --> 34:13.312
Since when do you ask me questions?

34:13.384 --> 34:16.045
Were you involved?

34:18.989 --> 34:22.016
Of course not.

34:22.092 --> 34:25.927
What kind of guy do you think l am?

34:32.235 --> 34:34.726
That's it. l'm done, Rigali.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.567
Done?

34:36.674 --> 34:39.609
With you, this. With this whole thing.

34:40.178 --> 34:43.773
And if l say no, what are you gonna do?

34:46.117 --> 34:49.518
You know, if l'm you, right now l'm thinking:

34:49.587 --> 34:54.114
''l could pop this guy right here and
who's gonna know it's not self-defense?''

34:56.893 --> 35:02.924
Let me remind you, anything happens to me,
a videotape lands at The Washington Post,

35:03.034 --> 35:07.903
showing a young Brad Follmer
taking cash from yours truly

35:07.972 --> 35:10.907
to make an indictment go away.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.208
You're done when l say you're done.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.843
lt's all in there.

36:29.954 --> 36:35.688
How you defrauded the FBl with a false
identity in order to enter the Academy.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.227
We know who you really are.

36:38.329 --> 36:41.025
We know about
your history with schizophrenia.

36:41.132 --> 36:46.866
We know that you orchestrated this entire
thing in order to get close to Agent Doggett.

36:46.971 --> 36:51.533
l've been recognized
by Agent Doggett's ex-wife,

36:53.077 --> 36:57.173
who failed to identify Nicholas Rigali
in that same room yesterday.

36:57.248 --> 37:01.878
Because Nicholas Rigali did not kill
Agent Doggett's son. You did.

37:02.853 --> 37:06.880
- That's one explanation.
- lt's the explanation.

37:06.991 --> 37:10.722
- No.
- What is? What is?

37:11.362 --> 37:16.493
l told you before, Agent Doggett.
l studied the photos of your son's death.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.197
They called to me.

37:21.272 --> 37:26.209
l don't know why,
but it was a message and l listened.

37:27.044 --> 37:30.036
And then you killed Agent Doggett's son.

37:30.114 --> 37:33.049
l studied his case obsessively.

37:34.552 --> 37:39.114
l'm a schizophrenic.
That's what schizophrenics do - obsess.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.688
l watched Agent Doggett.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.923
l watched his ex-wife too.

37:47.031 --> 37:51.263
She can't tell you how she recognizes me.
Just that she does.

37:51.736 --> 37:55.069
You're a liar.
You lied to the FBl. You're lying now.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.265
Would you have listened to me otherwise?

37:58.376 --> 38:02.540
A mental patient with insight
into your son's death?

38:02.613 --> 38:05.411
l wanted to get close to you, Agent Doggett.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.752
To help you.

38:08.819 --> 38:11.947
You gave me that tip,

38:12.056 --> 38:15.492
to find the woman's body in the wall.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.926
Rigali associated with the man
who abducted your son.

38:20.631 --> 38:24.123
l called you so that you could catch him.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.071
l've received another message.

38:34.945 --> 38:39.109
l'd like to go back home now,
to the institution.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.450
John? John.

38:53.364 --> 38:54.763
Well?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.933
He told us a story.
Whether it's true...

39:00.004 --> 39:03.303
ln other words, we're nowhere. Again.

39:31.068 --> 39:34.196
Well, well, it's the FBl agent.

39:41.645 --> 39:46.014
l'm not here as an FBl agent.
l'm here as a father.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.645
What could that mean?

39:48.719 --> 39:54.419
- l wanna know what happened to my son.
- l don't know who killed your son.

39:56.026 --> 40:00.360
But l like you, FBl. l really do.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.264
l'll tell you how it could have happened,
hypothetically.

40:08.672 --> 40:12.267
Say there was this guy, businessman.

40:13.043 --> 40:18.071
And say this businessman in the course of
doing business has to associate with thugs,

40:18.182 --> 40:20.514
sickos, perverts.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.846
Like Bob Harvey, for example.

40:27.024 --> 40:30.516
Say this Bob Harvey, he likes little boys.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.389
Yeah.

40:33.464 --> 40:35.364
Disgusting.

40:36.867 --> 40:42.203
Say one day Bob Harvey sees a little boy
riding a bike and he can't stand it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.434
He grabs the boy.

40:45.409 --> 40:50.711
So Harvey takes the boy to his place, only he
doesn't tell the businessman what he's doing.

40:51.215 --> 40:55.049
So the businessman walks in on him.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.917
You see what l'm saying, FBl?

40:57.988 --> 41:04.257
The boy sees the businessman's face - the
businessman who did nothing to this boy.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.294
That's a problem.

41:11.101 --> 41:16.471
Well, every problem has got a solution, right?

41:54.478 --> 41:58.812
Oh, my God. He shot him.
He just took out his gun and shot him.
