WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.509
MELISSA & JOEY IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.641
1500 BUCKS FOR A STORAGE LOCKER?

00:11.642 --> 00:13.313
WHY ARE THEY BIDDING SO MUCH?

00:13.314 --> 00:14.784
WELL, 'CAUSE HE'S JUST TRYING
TO SCREW THE OTHER GUY OVER.

00:14.785 --> 00:16.546
SEE, IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE STORAGE.

00:16.547 --> 00:18.318
IT'S ABOUT THE WAR.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.619
ALL BOYS OUT

00:19.620 --> 00:20.720
'CAUSE I GOT A
FRIEND COMING OVER.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.192
WHERE'RE YOUR
TELEVISION MANNERS?

00:22.193 --> 00:23.693
I'M OUT.

00:23.694 --> 00:24.794
LEAVE MY BEER.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.427
YEAH, I WAS JUST CLEARING.

00:27.398 --> 00:30.600
SO LET ME GUESS.

00:30.601 --> 00:32.031
10 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
COOKIE DOUGH...

00:32.032 --> 00:33.433
ONE OF YOUR GAL PALS
JUST GOT DUMPED

00:33.434 --> 00:34.734
AND YOU'RE THE FRIEND
THAT'S ON CALL.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.035
YEAH, YOU GOT A
PROBLEM WITH THAT?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.307
WOMEN ARE SUPPORTIVE
OF THEIR FRIENDS

00:37.308 --> 00:38.808
NO MATTER THE HOUR.

00:38.809 --> 00:40.710
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE
BEING DEFENSIVE.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.442
IT'S ANITA, ISN'T IT?

00:42.443 --> 00:44.344
SO WHAT IF IT IS? SHE'S
ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.745
YEAH, SURE. ONE OF
YOUR OLDEST FRIENDS

00:45.746 --> 00:47.377
THAT RUINED YOUR
20th BIRTHDAY PARTY

00:47.378 --> 00:48.778
WHEN SHE WAS MAKING OUT
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.320
OH, AND RUINED YOUR
25th BIRTHDAY PARTY

00:50.321 --> 00:51.721
WHEN SHE PUT ECSTASY
IN YOUR PUNCH.

00:51.722 --> 00:52.782
AND RUINED YOUR
30th BIRTHDAY PARTY

00:52.783 --> 00:54.424
WHEN SHE INVITED
THAT STRIPPER OVER

00:54.425 --> 00:56.786
WHO WAS DRESSED UP AS A COP
AND THEN HE ROBBED EVERYBODY.

00:56.787 --> 00:59.359
OH, YOU DO LISTEN TO MY STORIES.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.531
WELL, YEAH, SURE. THE
ANITA ONE'S STICK

01:01.532 --> 01:02.832
BECAUSE OF ALL THE CRAZY GLUE.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.764
MEL, THIS GIRL IS
NO GOOD FOR YOU.

01:04.765 --> 01:05.795
YOU'VE OUTGROWN HER.

01:05.796 --> 01:07.137
SHE NEEDS ME.

01:07.138 --> 01:08.698
SHE GIVES ME THESE
PUPPY-DOG EYES.

01:08.699 --> 01:11.201
- AND I CAN'T SAY NO.
- ( doorbell rings )

01:11.202 --> 01:12.742
DON'T DO IT. DON'T
OPEN THAT DOOR, MEL,

01:12.743 --> 01:14.144
AND BECOME THAT BLONDE
THAT GETS KILLED

01:14.145 --> 01:15.745
IN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES
OF A HORROR MOVIE.

01:15.746 --> 01:18.478
I AM CAPABLE OF BOUNDARIES.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.450
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE ONE HOUR,

01:20.451 --> 01:21.751
SOME COOKIE DOUGH,
A CLEANSING CRY,

01:21.752 --> 01:22.782
AND IT'S GOOD NIGHT, ANITA.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.154
YEAH, OKAY. THAT COULD WORK...

01:24.155 --> 01:25.816
IF YOU DRIVE A STAKE
THROUGH HER HEART.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.759
- MELLY.
- ANITA.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.621
- AWW.
- HI.

01:31.622 --> 01:33.123
OH, LOOK AT ME.

01:33.124 --> 01:34.794
I AM A RAW OPEN WOUND

01:34.795 --> 01:36.766
AND YOU'RE THE BEAUTIFUL
NURSE I NEED.

01:36.767 --> 01:37.867
OH, THAT I AM.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.629
OKAY, WELL,

01:39.630 --> 01:41.531
LET'S GET YOU HOOKED UP
TO A COOKIE DOUGH I.V.

01:41.532 --> 01:43.633
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT A
JERK THAT HENRY IS.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.805
FOR ONLY AN HOUR...

01:45.806 --> 01:48.438
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL THE
TIME HE DESERVES.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.740
ACTUALLY, THE MEDICINE I
NEED TO GET OVER HENRY

01:50.741 --> 01:52.782
IS A FEW MARTINIS AND
A CUTE BARTENDER.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.444
I KNOW ABOUT A PARTY DOWNTOWN.
WE GOT TO GO.

01:54.445 --> 01:55.685
NO, NO, NO.

01:55.686 --> 01:56.816
THIS GIRL'S NOT GOING
ANYWHERE TONIGHT.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.788
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE I CAN COUNT ON.

01:58.789 --> 02:00.650
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE,

02:00.651 --> 02:02.522
NURSE?

02:02.523 --> 02:03.693
I'M REALLY SORRY, ANITA,

02:03.694 --> 02:05.455
BUT I HAVE A REALLY BIG
MEETING WITH THE MAYOR

02:05.456 --> 02:06.526
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.829
OH, BUT MEL...

02:09.830 --> 02:11.231
DON'T GIVE ME THE
PUPPY-DOG EYES.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.802
OKAY, I'M NOT PUTTING ON
MY LITTLE BLACK DRESS

02:12.803 --> 02:15.134
AND MY PLATFORM HEELS
AND GOING OUT TONIGHT.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.637
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.340
( groans )

02:20.371 --> 02:22.212
I NEED ASPIRIN.

02:22.213 --> 02:23.314
HORSE ASPIRIN.

02:24.515 --> 02:26.516
THERE'S A GUY IN MY
HEAD WITH A HAMMER

02:26.517 --> 02:29.219
AND ONE OF US MUST DIE.

02:29.220 --> 02:30.680
UH, YOU'RE JUST GETTING HOME?

02:30.681 --> 02:33.152
WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE
HOUR AND BYE-BYE, ANITA?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.387
UH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE
POWER OF THE PUPPY-DOG EYES.

02:40.791 --> 02:46.767
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:48.369 --> 02:50.540
I REALIZE THIS MEETING'S
BEEN SET FOR THREE WEEKS

02:50.541 --> 02:52.542
AND I'M SO SORRY I MISSED
IT, BUT I WAS REALLY HOPING

02:52.543 --> 02:53.903
THAT THE MAYOR MIGHT
BE ABLE TO RESCHEDULE

02:53.904 --> 02:55.675
FOR SOME TIME LATER TODAY.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.408
- PLEASE DON'T LAUGH.
- ( dial tone )

02:58.409 --> 02:59.709
HELLO.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.211
ANITA MADE YOU MISS YOUR
MEETING WITH THE MAYOR?

03:01.212 --> 03:02.752
( scoffs ) LOOK AT THAT.
SHE'S RUINING YOUR LIFE

03:02.753 --> 03:04.384
AND IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR BIRTHDAY.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.855
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA CALL BACK

03:05.856 --> 03:07.557
AND SAY MY GREAT-AUNT
AGNES DIED.

03:07.558 --> 03:09.659
YEAH, AND IT'S NOT A LIE
BECAUSE SHE DID DIE

03:09.660 --> 03:11.291
LIKE EIGHT YEARS AGO.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.224
LOOK AT WHAT HOLLY'S DONE TO ME.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.725
HOLLY? I THOUGHT
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND

03:15.726 --> 03:17.867
WAS DONE DOING THINGS TO YOU.

03:17.868 --> 03:19.899
NO, LOOK, LAST WEEK
SHE UNFRIENDED ME

03:19.900 --> 03:22.201
AND EVERYONE'S FOLLOWED
HER LIKE SHEEP.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.774
I USED TO HAVE 683.

03:24.775 --> 03:26.476
NOW I'M DOWN TO THE 400s.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.207
I HAVE LESS THAN GRANDMA.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.680
WELL, YOUR GRANDMA ROCKS A
LITTLE HARDER THAN YOU DO.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.542
IT'S ERODING MY SELF-ESTEEM.

03:32.543 --> 03:33.713
YEAH?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.345
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR YOUR SELF-ESTEEM?

03:35.346 --> 03:36.916
TO IMPRESS YOUR
TEACHER, WHICH IS ME.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.917
YOU STILL OWE ME THAT
THOUSAND WORD ESSAY

03:37.918 --> 03:38.918
ON A SHAKESPEARE PLAY.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.920
FRIGGIN' SHAKESPEARE.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.922
( mockingly ) OOH,
I WROTE 500 PLAYS.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.825
I KISSED GWYNETH PALTROW.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.559
WELL, ON HER DEATH BED,
MY AUNT AGNES SAID

03:49.560 --> 03:52.802
"HONEY, DO WELL WITH THAT
MEETING WITH THE MAYOR."

03:52.803 --> 03:55.335
- ( dial tone )
- HELLO?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.367
HELLO?

03:57.368 --> 03:58.708
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU JUST DIDN'T

03:58.709 --> 03:59.839
DITCH ANITA LAST
NIGHT AND COME HOME.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.841
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WERE
HANDCUFFED TO HER.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.743
ACTUALLY, I WAS
HANDCUFFED TO HER.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.377
ANITA DRAGGED ME TO A
VERY STRANGE PARTY.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.479
NO, NOT THAT KIND OF PARTY.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.782
THERE WAS A MAGICIAN AND
NOT A VERY GOOD ONE.

04:12.783 --> 04:15.355
YEAH, HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
TO FIND A 24-HOUR LOCKSMITH

04:15.356 --> 04:17.827
WITH A PASSED-OUT WOMAN
ATTACHED TO YOU?

04:17.828 --> 04:20.490
NO COMMENT.

04:20.491 --> 04:21.931
WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO HAPPEN

04:21.932 --> 04:23.262
BEFORE YOU DUMP THIS WOMAN, HUH?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.664
WHAT, DOES SHE NEED
TO SET YOU ON FIRE?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.666
OH, SHE ALREADY DID THAT.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.498
SPRING BREAK JUNIOR YEAR,

04:28.499 --> 04:30.870
SHE TALKED ME INTO DOING
FLAMING BODY SHOTS.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.271
THE GOOD NEWS, I
DIDN'T HAVE TO GET

04:32.272 --> 04:33.943
A BIKINI WAX FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

04:33.944 --> 04:36.476
LOOK, YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THIS
FRIEND AND YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.808
I KNOW, BUT HOW DO YOU
END IT WITH A FRIEND?

04:38.809 --> 04:40.650
THE SAME WAY YOU END
IT WITH AN EMPLOYEE.

04:40.651 --> 04:42.652
LOOK, IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE,
BEFORE THIS KITCHEN,

04:42.653 --> 04:44.614
I FIRED A LOT OF PEOPLE
AND I FIRED THEM WELL.

04:44.615 --> 04:45.785
LOOK, LET ME SHOW
YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.816
OKAY, YOU BE ANITA
AND I'LL BE YOU.

04:46.817 --> 04:48.418
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

04:48.419 --> 04:49.789
ANITA, HEY, LISTEN.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.321
EFFECTIVE TODAY, I'M TERMINATING

04:51.322 --> 04:52.692
THIS FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.923
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
CONVERSATION TO HAVE,

04:53.924 --> 04:55.725
BUT NEITHER ARE WE
MUTUALLY BENEFITING

04:55.726 --> 04:56.966
FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.729
BUT I AM SURE THAT WITH
YOUR WINNING ATTITUDE

04:59.730 --> 05:00.900
AND YOUR POSITIVE PERSONALITY,

05:00.901 --> 05:02.532
THAT YOU WILL FIND A
NEW FRIEND IN NO TIME.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.874
THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD LUCK.

05:05.636 --> 05:07.076
I DIDN'T GET TO SAY ANYTHING.

05:07.077 --> 05:09.008
YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU'VE JUST BEEN FIRED...

05:09.009 --> 05:10.510
BY THE BEST.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.081
( door locks )

05:12.082 --> 05:13.683
( door rattles )

05:13.684 --> 05:14.914
HEY, HEY! ( knocking )

05:14.915 --> 05:17.488
DON'T MAKE ME CALL SECURITY.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.991
OH MAN, I NEED TO SEE WHAT TIME I'M
SUPPOSED TO PICK UP MY LITTLE SISTER,

05:21.992 --> 05:23.693
BUT MY PHONES DEAD.
CAN I BORROW YOURS?

05:23.694 --> 05:25.355
OH, YEAH, SURE.

05:25.356 --> 05:27.597
MY PASSCODE IS 2742,

05:27.598 --> 05:29.629
OH MY GOD.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.732
I JUST GAVE YOU MY PASSCODE.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.863
WOW, THAT'S TRUE. YOU DID.

05:33.864 --> 05:37.407
I NEVER DID THAT
BEFORE WITH A BOY.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.539
I'M YOUR FIRST?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.070
YOU ARE.

05:41.071 --> 05:42.772
MINE'S 8432.

05:42.773 --> 05:44.974
UH, I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

05:44.975 --> 05:47.076
WAIT, WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

05:47.077 --> 05:49.048
- 8432.
- RIGHT.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.750
- YEAH.
- SPEAKING OF NUMBERS,

05:50.751 --> 05:53.883
I WAS WONDERING, DID YOU
EVER GET YOUR S.A.T. SCORES?

05:53.884 --> 05:55.686
NO.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.388
NAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

05:58.389 --> 05:59.759
IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.090
THEY SENT IT TO THE
WRONG EMAIL, I GUESS.

06:01.091 --> 06:03.834
MAYBE S.A.T. STANDS FOR
"SORRY ABOUT THAT."

06:06.767 --> 06:09.839
HEY, GUYS. YOU TWO ARE SO CUTE.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.970
WHEN I USED TO TELL MY MOM

06:10.971 --> 06:12.602
THAT I WAS AT MY
BOYFRIEND'S STUDYING,

06:12.603 --> 06:15.505
WE WERE ACTUALLY...

06:15.506 --> 06:17.076
STUDYING, JUST STUDYING.
CARRY ON.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.779
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS, THOUGH?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.751
I MEAN IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

06:21.752 --> 06:24.584
NO, THE COLLEGES SEE THE S.A.T.
SCORES

06:24.585 --> 06:26.486
SO I DON'T NEED TO SEE MINE.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.757
NOT LIKE IT'S GONNA
CHANGE MY LIFE.

06:27.758 --> 06:29.760
UH, YOU ARE SO EVOLVED.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.826
HE IS SO LYING!
WHY IS HE LYING?!

06:36.827 --> 06:39.068
I SHOWED HIM MINE AND
HE WON'T SHOW ME HIS.

06:39.069 --> 06:40.530
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR,

06:40.531 --> 06:42.932
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT S.A.T.
SCORES HERE?

06:42.933 --> 06:44.133
WHAT'S HE HIDING?

06:44.134 --> 06:45.775
WE JUST SWAPPED PHONE PASSCODES

06:45.776 --> 06:47.477
AND NOW HE'S KEEPING SECRETS?

06:47.478 --> 06:50.079
MEN ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THEIR SCORES.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.083
OH, SO YOU THINK HE
DIDN'T DO SO HOT.

06:54.084 --> 06:55.945
LENNOX, YOU DID EXTREMELY WELL.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.146
I'M SURE HE'S EMBARRASSED

06:57.147 --> 06:58.518
AND AFRAID YOU WON'T
WANT TO DATE HIM

06:58.519 --> 07:00.520
WHEN YOU FIND OUT
HIS SCORES ARE...

07:00.521 --> 07:02.722
WELL, TECHNICALLY, ( squeaks ).

07:02.723 --> 07:05.895
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE
HIM FOR HIS SCORE.

07:05.896 --> 07:07.927
I MEAN, IF I DID
BETTER, I DID BETTER.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.599
HONEY, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

07:09.600 --> 07:10.900
WITH GUYS AND THEIR EGOS.

07:10.901 --> 07:12.131
MEN ARE FRAGILE CREATURES.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.733
TREAD LIGHTLY.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.806
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU DON'T
THINK S.A.T. SCORES ARE IMPORTANT.

07:16.807 --> 07:19.038
SO JUST SAY SOMETHING
THAT MAKES HIM FEEL GOOD?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.771
YEAH, EVERYONE LIKES TO
HAVE THEIR EGOS STROKED.

07:21.772 --> 07:23.743
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE
A LITTLE INSECURE.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.114
THANKS, AUNT MEL.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.076
YOU ALWAYS KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY

07:27.077 --> 07:28.748
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.952
AND YOU'RE SO WISE
AND SO PRETTY.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.755
THANKS, HONEY.

07:36.226 --> 07:38.659
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:40.531 --> 07:41.791
- HELLO, JOE.
- HEY.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.734
WOW, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

07:44.735 --> 07:46.866
LIKE YOU JUST LOST 120 POUNDS...

07:46.867 --> 07:48.698
OF UNWANTED FRIEND.

07:48.699 --> 07:50.700
I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU
TOLD ME TO WITH ANITA.

07:50.701 --> 07:51.901
I PUT MY ARM AROUND
HER SHOULDER.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.042
AND I GAVE HER THE
HEAVE-HO SPEECH.

07:53.043 --> 07:54.805
AND I HEAVED THAT HOE.

07:56.507 --> 07:57.807
YEAH, AND WE HAD A GOOD-BYE HUG

07:57.808 --> 07:59.078
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN
A CALL OR TEXT SINCE.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.711
ANYWAY, ANITA IS NOW
IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR

08:01.712 --> 08:03.252
AND FADING FAST.

08:03.253 --> 08:04.984
GO ON, ADMIT IT. IT
FELT GOOD, DIDN'T IT?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.786
YEAH, IT KINDA DID.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.918
YEAH, THAT'S THE
ASSASSIN'S RUSH.

08:08.919 --> 08:11.722
GOD, I MISS THAT.

08:14.865 --> 08:15.995
ALL RIGHT, A QUARTER
POUND OF BURATTA,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.727
MY LOAF OF FOCACCIA,
MY TRUFFLE OIL.

08:17.728 --> 08:20.099
WHERE'S MY SOPPRESSATA?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.732
SOLD THE LAST QUARTER POUND
TO THE LADY OVER THERE.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.073
ALDO, THAT'S MY STANDING ORDER.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.905
I GET THAT ORDER
EVERY SINGLE WEEK.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.877
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST GAVE MY
SOPPRESSATA TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

08:27.878 --> 08:29.880
SHE'S GOT BETTER LEGS THAN YOU.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.615
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.846
I'M SORRY, I THINK
YOU HAVE MY...

08:36.847 --> 08:38.788
- ANITA.
- JOE?

08:38.789 --> 08:40.149
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU SHOP HERE.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.751
THIS IS MY SPOT.

08:41.752 --> 08:43.222
WELL, I DON'T COME HERE OFTEN,

08:43.223 --> 08:45.925
BUT I WAS PICKING UP THINGS FOR
A FRIEND'S GALLERY OPENING.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.797
AND I JUST KNEW THIS
WOULD BE THE PLACE TO...

08:47.798 --> 08:48.928
STEAL MY SOPPRESSATA?

08:48.929 --> 08:52.001
WELL, I AM NOT GIVING IT BACK.

08:52.002 --> 08:54.964
NOT THAT I COULD STOP YOU
WITH THOSE ARMS OF YOURS.

08:54.965 --> 08:56.806
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH THEM.

08:56.807 --> 08:57.907
I KNOW.

08:57.908 --> 09:01.070
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
ASK PERMISSION.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.112
YOU KNOW, FIRST TASTE IS FREE.

09:03.113 --> 09:05.575
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.146
I'LL GIVE YOU THE SOPPRESSATA...

09:07.147 --> 09:08.177
OH THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.749
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE

09:09.750 --> 09:11.681
TO COME TO THE GALLERY
TONIGHT WITH ME.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.853
OH JEEZE. UH...

09:13.854 --> 09:16.055
NO, I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD DO THAT.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.727
I MEAN, WITH EVERYTHING GOING
ON BETWEEN YOU AND MEL,

09:17.728 --> 09:19.188
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.662
OH, BUT JOE...

09:23.834 --> 09:26.796
WHEW, SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

09:26.797 --> 09:28.297
THAT GALLERY SHOW
WAS PRETTY GOOD.

09:28.298 --> 09:30.640
BUT IT'S A SHAME THEY COULDN'T
FRAME WHAT WE JUST DID

09:30.641 --> 09:33.342
BECAUSE THAT WAS A WORK OF ART.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.075
( both giggle )

09:40.150 --> 09:41.852
( whistling )

09:42.853 --> 09:44.183
MEL, HEY.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.855
IT'S ALMOST 9 O'CLOCK.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

09:45.856 --> 09:46.956
WELL, I COULDN'T DECIDE

09:46.957 --> 09:48.818
IF I WANTED TO WEAR
MY HAIR UP OR DOWN

09:48.819 --> 09:50.019
OR HALF-UP HALF-DOWN.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.061
IT'S ON YOUR HEAD.
IT LOOKS GREAT.

09:52.062 --> 09:53.923
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
NOW LET'S GET YOU OFF TO WORK.

09:53.924 --> 09:55.164
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD MY COFFEE YET.

09:55.165 --> 09:56.926
GRAB IT ON THE WAY.
GRAB IT ON THE WAY.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.898
GO TO ONE OF THOSE LITTLE MOM AND POP
PLACES. IT WILL HELP THE ECONOMY.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.069
- COME ON.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

10:00.070 --> 10:01.300
ALL RIGHT, SO GO TO A BIG CHAIN.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.702
IT ALL JUST TRICKLES
DOWN ANYWAY.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.803
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

10:03.804 --> 10:05.074
IS NOTHING DELAYS YOU
FROM LEAVING THIS HOUSE.

10:05.075 --> 10:06.976
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU SO JUMPY ABOUT?

10:06.977 --> 10:08.978
OH.

10:08.979 --> 10:11.010
YOU HAD A SLEEPOVER PARTY.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.012
HELLO, MEL.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.314
WITH ANITA?!

10:15.946 --> 10:18.648
OH, MEL, I'M SO SORRY. JOE
SAID YOU WERE GONNA BE GONE.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.890
I DIDN'T WANT THERE TO
BE ANY AWKWARDNESS.

10:20.891 --> 10:23.052
LUCKILY WE DODGED THAT BULLET.

10:23.053 --> 10:24.954
I DIDN'T PLAN THIS, BUT
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,

10:24.955 --> 10:26.996
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT
LIGHTEN THE MOOD?

10:26.997 --> 10:29.228
IF I MIX US UP A
BATCH OF MIMOSAS.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.131
I COULD ALWAYS TOSS
IN A LITTLE ECSTASY.

10:32.963 --> 10:35.404
JUST JOKING.

10:35.405 --> 10:36.737
IT'S NOT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.069
- THAT WAS FUNNY.
- OKAY NO ALCOHOL FOR ME,

10:40.070 --> 10:42.041
THANKS. I LIKE TO KEEP
MY WITS ABOUT ME,

10:42.042 --> 10:44.373
AND MY JOB, AND MY BLOUSE...
IS THAT MINE?!

10:44.374 --> 10:46.145
WHAT THIS? NO.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.316
( scoffs ) NO.

10:47.317 --> 10:49.679
YOU THINK I SNUCK INTO YOUR ROOM

10:49.680 --> 10:51.380
AND PULLED IT OUT
OF YOUR CLOSET?

10:51.381 --> 10:53.022
( laughs )

10:53.023 --> 10:54.224
SILLY.

10:55.726 --> 10:57.757
THAT REALLY IS SILLY, MEL.
THAT'S SO SILLY.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.029
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

11:00.030 --> 11:02.261
- CALL ME LATER.
- OKAY.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.694
ALL RIGHT.

11:05.035 --> 11:07.666
HOW COULD YOU HAVE HER OVER HERE

11:07.667 --> 11:09.368
WHEN I WORKED SO HARD
TO GET RID OF HER?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.842
SHE IS CRAZY AND
MANIPULATIVE AND SELFISH.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.844
AND THAT WAS
DEFINITELY MY BLOUSE.

11:14.845 --> 11:16.906
I GOT TO TELL YOU, BURKE.
A LITTLE CRAZY

11:16.907 --> 11:19.008
IS KINDA FUN SOMETIMES.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.449
AND SHE IS NOT SELFISH.
BELIEVE ME.

11:20.450 --> 11:23.813
OKAY, SO ALL THAT MATTERS
TO YOU IS THE LONGO BONGO.

11:23.814 --> 11:25.154
NO. NO, LOOK.

11:25.155 --> 11:26.685
SHE GAVE ME HER SOPPRESSATA

11:26.686 --> 11:28.057
RIGHT OUT OF THE
BOTTOM OF HER BASKET.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.289
IS THAT SOME SORT OF
ITALIAN SEX CODE?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.420
NO, DON'T EVEN TELL ME!

11:31.421 --> 11:33.763
IT'S ITALIAN COLD CUTS.

11:33.764 --> 11:36.165
I RAN INTO HER AT
ALDO'S AND SPARKS FLEW.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.929
SO SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE AT ALDO'S,

11:39.930 --> 11:42.001
THE GOURMET STORE YOU
GO TO EVERY MONDAY?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.033
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:44.034 --> 11:46.135
SHE STALKED YOU. ( gasped )

11:46.136 --> 11:47.476
SHE GAVE YOU THE PUPPY-DOG
EYES, DIDN'T SHE?

11:47.477 --> 11:49.809
NO! ( scoffs )

11:49.810 --> 11:52.311
I DON'T KNOW.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.443
SHE MIGHT HAVE.

11:54.444 --> 11:55.985
THIS IS HER PLAN.

11:55.986 --> 11:57.316
ANITA IS SLEEPING WITH YOU

11:57.317 --> 11:59.088
SO SHE CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH ME AGAIN.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.020
SEE, YOU ARE SIMPLY
THE ROAD BACK TO ME.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.022
HEY, HEY. I AM NOT
THE ROAD BACK.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.025
OKAY, I AM THE DESTINATION.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.897
I AM THE POT OF GOLD.

12:07.898 --> 12:09.829
- ROAD BACK.
- POT OF GOLD.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.100
- ROAD BACK.
- POT OF GOLD.

12:11.101 --> 12:12.361
OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT? I
REFUSE TO CONTINUE

12:12.362 --> 12:14.034
THIS JUVENILE EXCHANGE.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.737
ROAD BACK!

12:18.939 --> 12:20.069
I JUST FEEL REALLY BAD

12:20.070 --> 12:21.911
'CAUSE WE HAD A
WONDERFUL AFTERNOON

12:21.912 --> 12:25.044
WHERE WE SWAPPED PASSCODES
AND THEN I KIND OF RUINED IT

12:25.045 --> 12:26.916
BY ASKING YOU ABOUT
YOUR S.A.T's,

12:26.917 --> 12:30.049
WHICH WAS WRONG BECAUSE GRADES
AND NUMBERS DON'T MATTER.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.921
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

12:31.922 --> 12:33.452
I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
ANY SECRETS BETWEEN US.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.856
THE TRUTH IS I DID GET MY S.A.T.
RESULTS BACK.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.887
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU.

12:37.888 --> 12:39.228
AWW, SWEETIE, THAT'S OKAY.

12:39.229 --> 12:41.060
YOU KNOW SCORES
AREN'T IMPORTANT.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.361
I GOT A 2300.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.894
YOU BEAT ME BY 200 POINTS?!

12:44.895 --> 12:46.366
NO FREAKING WAY!

12:48.038 --> 12:49.398
IT'S 250.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.070
WHAT, ARE YOU
SAYING I CAN'T ADD?

12:51.071 --> 12:52.371
TECHNICALLY YOU CAN'T SUBRACT.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.404
BUT HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?

12:55.405 --> 12:57.146
I MEAN YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

12:57.147 --> 12:59.979
WAIT, SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARTISTS AREN'T SMART?

12:59.980 --> 13:04.013
WELL, YEAH, THEY HAVE LIKE
SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE.

13:04.014 --> 13:06.115
SEE, THIS IS WHY I
DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU.

13:06.116 --> 13:09.919
OH, WHAT? YOU THOUGHT
I'D OVERREACT?!

13:09.920 --> 13:12.091
LET'S JUST NOT TALK ABOUT S.A.T.
SCORES ANYMORE.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.063
WHY DON'T I HELP YOU
WITH YOUR CHEM MIDTERM?

13:14.064 --> 13:15.965
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.927
I WILL DO JUST FINE ON MY OWN.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.999
IN FACT, I WILL BURY YOU.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.031
MY OWN SISTER UNFRIENDED ME.

13:22.032 --> 13:24.073
WE ONCE SHARED A BATHTUB.

13:24.074 --> 13:27.406
WELL, YEAH, THE LAST THING I
WANT TO DO IS ALIENATE HOLLY.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.378
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HURTING
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S FEELINGS?

13:29.379 --> 13:32.111
'CAUSE TRUST ME SHE
HAS NO FEELINGS.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.084
SHE'S LIKE SCARY POWERFUL.
SHE HAS OVER 2,000 FRIENDS.

13:35.085 --> 13:36.246
YOU DON'T MESS WITH A
CONNECTOR LIKE THAT.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.152
ZANDER, BUDDY.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.024
HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.325
BAD.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.057
LENNOX IS FREAKING OUT

13:48.058 --> 13:49.398
BECAUSE I OUTSCORED
HER ON THE S.A.T's.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.430
( laughs ) YOU TOLD
HER WHAT YOU GOT?

13:51.431 --> 13:54.463
THE S.A.T's DO NOT MEASURE
COMMON SENSE APPARENTLY.

13:54.464 --> 13:56.305
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
A LOT ABOUT GIRLS,

13:56.306 --> 13:58.407
BUT I DO KNOW A
LOT ABOUT LENNOX.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.109
LET HER WIN

14:00.110 --> 14:02.112
UNLESS YOU WANT A BATTLESHIP
SHOVED UP YOUR NOSE.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.216
WOW, IT SMELLS AMAZING IN HERE.
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

14:07.217 --> 14:09.018
OH, WE'RE GONNA START OFF
WITH A LITTLE BRUSCHETTA,

14:09.019 --> 14:10.049
THEN GO TO MUSSELS
WITH WHITE WINE.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.350
AND FOR THE FINALE,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.352
HANDMADE LOBSTER-STUFFED
RAVIOLI.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.324
WOW, WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE ALL THIS?

14:15.325 --> 14:17.856
NOT A DAMN THING.
IT'S FOR ANITA.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.988
WHAT DO I GET?

14:18.989 --> 14:20.189
EGG SALAD SANDWICH.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.562
I THINK THOSE DARK SPOTS
IN THERE ARE BACON BITS.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.395
FUNNY HOW ALL OF YOUR
DATES WITH ANITA

14:26.396 --> 14:29.298
SEEM TO TAKE PLACE AT
MY HOUSE WHERE I AM.

14:29.299 --> 14:31.600
WRONG. TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA
BE EATING THIS AT HER PLACE.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.272
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE NICE FOR US TO DINE

14:33.273 --> 14:36.075
WHERE THE AMBIANCE
IS A LITTLE LESS...

14:36.076 --> 14:37.306
YOU.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.008
OH, I SEE.

14:39.009 --> 14:41.350
I SUGGESTED HER PLACE AND
SHE SAID "YEAH, GREAT."

14:41.351 --> 14:43.382
WELL, THEN I GUESS,
GOOD FOR YOU.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.884
( Joe's phone rings )

14:45.885 --> 14:48.057
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S ANITA.

14:48.058 --> 14:50.159
- ( beeps )
- HEY.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.561
YEAH, I'M JUST PACKING UP.
I'LL BE OVER IN A FEW.

14:52.562 --> 14:54.924
YOU HAD A WHAT?

14:54.925 --> 14:57.097
A GAS LEAK? ARE YOU OKAY?

14:59.229 --> 15:01.570
UM, YEAH, NO. THAT'S FINE.

15:01.571 --> 15:03.302
WE COULD...

15:03.303 --> 15:04.673
WE COULD JUST EAT OVER HERE.

15:04.674 --> 15:07.036
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY.

15:07.037 --> 15:08.207
BYE-BYE.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.509
HMM.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.411
GAS LEAK, THAT'S CONVENIENT.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.284
YOU CAN'T SEE IT AND THERE'S
NO LINGERING EVIDENCE.

15:15.285 --> 15:17.446
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- "DUH" IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.148
THIS MEAL WAS NEVER
GONNA TAKE PLACE

15:19.149 --> 15:20.149
AT HER HOUSE, JOE.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.021
SHE'S AFTER ME.

15:21.022 --> 15:23.052
UH-UH. NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:23.053 --> 15:24.093
SHE'S INTO ME, OKAY.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.924
AND I CAN PROVE IT TO
YOU SCIENTIFICALLY.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.127
SO CLEARLY AS A MATTER OF
FACT THAT EVEN YOU WITH YOUR

15:28.128 --> 15:30.029
BLONDE HELMET OF DENIAL
WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.060
ALL RIGHT?

15:31.061 --> 15:32.361
LOOK, I GOT A PLAN.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.033
I'M JUST GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.335
YEAH, SURE. YOU KNOW I'LL
DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO

15:36.336 --> 15:38.167
TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.568
JUST EAT YOUR CRAPPY SANDWICH.

15:39.569 --> 15:41.371
JOKES ON YOU. IT'S DELICIOUS.

15:46.116 --> 15:47.617
( doorbell rings )

15:50.320 --> 15:53.682
YEOW, I GOT MY TEST BACK.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.684
THAT CHEM MIDTERM BEAT ME
UP AND TOOK MY LUNCH MONEY.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.386
OH, I'M SORRY.

15:57.387 --> 15:59.528
NOT THAT GRADES ARE
IMPORTANT, BUT HOW BAD?

15:59.529 --> 16:01.630
- A "C" MINUS.
- I GOT AN "A" MINUS, HA!

16:01.631 --> 16:05.594
WHY DID I SAY THAT?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

16:05.595 --> 16:07.036
IT'S OKAY, BABE. WE SHARE.

16:07.037 --> 16:08.667
YOU WERE JUST SHARING LOUDLY.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.739
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
A COMPETITION.

16:10.740 --> 16:14.573
BUT TO ME IT IS. OH MY GOD.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.376
I'M COMPETITIVE...
TOO COMPETITIVE.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.707
IT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.579
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
WHO I WANT TO BE.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.481
YOU KNOW I NEED TO
BECOME A BETTER PERSON.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.286
MAYBE EVEN THE BEST PERSON...
OH MY GOD, I'M DOING IT AGAIN!

16:27.717 --> 16:30.019
HOW CAN YOU STAND HAVING
ME AS A GIRLFRIEND?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.690
'CAUSE YOU'RE AN
AMAZING GIRLFRIEND.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.692
THE BEST GIRLFRIEND EVER.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.694
AND THAT'S A COMPETITION
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WIN.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.397
AWW.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.070
YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER
COMPETITION YOU WIN?

16:41.231 --> 16:44.303
BEST SISTER.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.634
I'M NOT REFRIENDING YOU.

16:45.635 --> 16:48.107
NOT IN REAL LIFE,
JUST ON FACEBOOK.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.379
I'M DOWN TO NINE FRIENDS.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.311
AND SOON YOU'LL BE DOWN TO ZERO.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.713
JUST LET GO.

16:55.085 --> 16:57.586
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU DID
SO POORLY ON YOUR TEST,

16:57.587 --> 16:59.188
BUT I KNOW WHAT'LL FIX THIS.

16:59.189 --> 17:01.390
WE GOT A HIDDEN STASH OF RYDER'S
PORK RINDS IN THE GARAGE.

17:01.391 --> 17:04.353
HEY, THOSE ARE FOR FRIENDS ONLY.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.396
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO
MUCH OF IT OUT THERE.

17:07.197 --> 17:09.528
A "C" MINUS, HUH?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.331
SO YOU LISTENED TO
YOUR UNCLE RYDER,

17:12.332 --> 17:14.803
TANKED THE TEST ON PURPOSE,
LET HER WIN, GOOD MAN.

17:14.804 --> 17:16.435
ACTUALLY, I WOULD
NEVER TANK A TEST.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.566
THAT'S MY BUDDY DAN'S TEST.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.809
AND LUCKILY HE SMOKES
A LOT OF WEED.

17:21.611 --> 17:24.513
YEAH, I JUST WHITED OUT
HIS NAME AND PUT IN MINE.

17:24.514 --> 17:26.645
WOW, NICE TWIST. I DID
NOT SEE THAT COMING.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.278
YOU KNOW WE COULD LEARN
A LOT FROM EACH OTHER.

17:29.279 --> 17:31.180
HOW ABOUT I FRIEND YOU?

17:31.181 --> 17:33.182
I DON'T THINK LENNOX WOULD
LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

17:33.183 --> 17:34.453
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WOULDN'T LIKE?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.684
FINDING OUT THAT YOU LIED TO HER

17:35.685 --> 17:37.227
ABOUT THE WHOLE TEST THING.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.259
OKAY, FRIEND REQUEST ACCEPTED.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.163
YES! BACK TO DOUBLE DIGITS.

17:43.633 --> 17:46.095
- TO US.
- YES.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.336
TO US.

17:47.337 --> 17:48.697
ANITA, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

17:48.698 --> 17:50.639
DO YOU THINK IT'S
A LITTLE STRANGE

17:50.640 --> 17:52.741
THAT YOU AND I ARE
ALWAYS HAVING OUR MEALS

17:52.742 --> 17:53.842
HERE IN MEL'S DINING ROOM?

17:53.843 --> 17:55.344
I DON'T MIND.

17:55.345 --> 17:57.646
ANYWHERE YOU ARE IS THE
PLACE I WANT TO BE.

17:57.647 --> 18:00.078
THAT'S SO NICE TO HEAR.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.681
AND YET NOT SURPRISING.

18:03.513 --> 18:05.414
HEY, I HOPE YOU LIKE THE WINE.

18:05.415 --> 18:08.418
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL BOTTLE.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.722
( loudly ) IT'S A
VERY SPECIAL BOTTLE!

18:14.824 --> 18:17.326
MEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:17.327 --> 18:18.568
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WORKING LATE TONIGHT.

18:19.569 --> 18:20.729
WELL, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.371
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, JOE LONGO?

18:22.372 --> 18:24.833
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE

18:24.834 --> 18:26.535
A ROMANTIC DINNER
HERE WITH ANITA.

18:26.536 --> 18:27.637
WELL, THIS DATE IS OVER.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.679
MY HOUSE, MY RULES.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.241
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU CAN GET OUT!

18:32.242 --> 18:34.613
YOU... YOU KNOW WHAT? UM...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.645
( awkwardly ) MAYBE I WILL.

18:36.646 --> 18:39.388
OKAY? BECAUSE THIS HAS
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING

18:39.389 --> 18:41.690
AND THAT SMALL FINAL ACT
HAS BEEN THE TIPPING POINT

18:41.691 --> 18:43.592
THAT HAS FINALLY...

18:43.593 --> 18:44.753
TIPPED ME.

18:44.754 --> 18:47.296
I QUIT.

18:47.297 --> 18:48.297
WAIT, WHAT?

18:48.298 --> 18:49.628
OH, WELL, REAL QUICK.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.129
BEFORE YOU QUIT, YOU'RE FIRED!

18:51.130 --> 18:54.263
NO, YOU GUYS CAN STILL
WORK THINGS OUT.

18:54.264 --> 18:55.564
NO, I DON'T WANT TO
WORK THINGS OUT.

18:55.565 --> 18:57.706
COME ON, ANITA. WE WILL
BE SO MUCH HAPPIER,

18:57.707 --> 18:58.737
THE FURTHER WE ARE
AWAY FROM HER.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.539
BUT... BUT BREAKING THINGS OFF

19:00.540 --> 19:02.211
IS SUCH A DRASTIC STEP.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.443
I MEAN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S
SOMEONE AS GREAT AS MEL.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.345
NO, BUT I WANT TO. COME
ON, LETS GET OUT OF HERE.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.377
WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO
SEE HER EVER AGAIN.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.450
BUT I WAS SO CLOSE
TO GETTING HER BACK!

19:12.522 --> 19:14.353
WHAT WAS THAT, ANITA? I
DON'T THINK JOE HEARD YOU.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.655
ONE OF HIS BRAINS IS DEAF.

19:16.656 --> 19:21.360
LOOK, I WANT YOU BACK
IN MY LIFE, MELLY.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.432
AND I WAS WILLING TO
TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES

19:23.433 --> 19:24.564
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

19:26.596 --> 19:28.897
I'M DESPERATE MEASURES?

19:28.898 --> 19:31.640
I'M THE POT OF GOLD.

19:31.641 --> 19:34.673
THAT SOUNDED BAD.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.575
YOU THINK?

19:36.576 --> 19:37.706
YOU'RE SWEET, JOE.

19:37.707 --> 19:40.649
BUT YOU WERE A
MEANS TO AN END...

19:40.650 --> 19:46.315
A FUN AND VERY BOUNCY
MEANS TO AN END.

19:46.316 --> 19:48.787
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.220
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

19:51.461 --> 19:53.592
ANITA, I THINK IT'S
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.194
OH, BUT MEL...

19:56.195 --> 19:58.797
HEY, SHE'S DOING THE EYES.
LOOK AWAY. LOOK AWAY.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.629
BUT, MEL, DON'T YOU WANT
ALL YOUR BLOUSES BACK?

20:00.630 --> 20:03.332
ALL?! HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?

20:03.333 --> 20:04.373
WRITE THEM OFF,
BURKE, ALL RIGHT.

20:04.374 --> 20:05.434
IT'S THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.705
ANITA, LISTEN. LISTEN.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.277
I'M SO SORRY.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.479
THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK
OUT, BUT I'M SURE

20:10.480 --> 20:12.841
WITH YOUR WINNING ATTITUDE

20:12.842 --> 20:14.513
AND YOUR VERY DANGEROUS
PERSONALITY,

20:14.514 --> 20:15.784
THAT YOU'LL HAVE NO
PROBLEM SCAMMING YOUR WAY

20:15.785 --> 20:17.616
INTO ANOTHER
FRIENDSHIP VERY SOON.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.289
SO THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.754
WHY ARE THE HOT ONES
ALWAYS SO DAMN CRAZY?

20:25.755 --> 20:27.596
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
WAS HARD FOR YOU.

20:27.597 --> 20:29.428
IF IT'S TOO PAINFUL, WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.500
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M A BIG BOY.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

20:31.501 --> 20:34.633
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

20:34.634 --> 20:37.536
♪ I WAS RIGHT. I WAS RIGHT ♪

20:37.537 --> 20:38.767
♪ I WAS RIGHT... ♪

20:38.768 --> 20:40.008
- BOOM.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW...

20:40.009 --> 20:43.812
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE
CAN BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.

20:43.813 --> 20:46.645
I MEAN I DON'T... I DON'T...

20:46.646 --> 20:48.677
I DON'T SEE THE APPEAL.
I REALLY...

20:48.678 --> 20:51.281
I'M STILL NOT SEEING IT.

20:58.488 --> 20:59.828
I'M BACK. I'M BACK BIG-TIME.

20:59.829 --> 21:00.859
LOOK AT THIS.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.031
800 NEW FRIENDS IN
THE PAST TWO HOURS.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.633
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

21:04.634 --> 21:05.894
I ACCEPTED A FRIEND REQUEST

21:05.895 --> 21:06.895
FROM AUNT MEL'S FRIEND ANITA.

21:06.896 --> 21:08.297
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

21:08.298 --> 21:09.638
YEAH, AND SHE STARTED POSTING

21:09.639 --> 21:11.770
ALL THESE PICTURES OF HERSELF
SUNBATHING IN COSTA RICA

21:11.771 --> 21:12.842
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I BLEW UP.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.475
TAKE THAT, HOLLY. IN YOUR FACE.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.547
OH, WOW.

21:18.548 --> 21:20.849
ANITA WANTS TO STOP BY A LITTLE LATER.
SAY, HI.

21:20.850 --> 21:22.981
- MAN, SHE IS THE COOLEST.
- NO!

21:22.982 --> 21:23.983
LOCK THE DOORS. LOCK THE DOORS.
