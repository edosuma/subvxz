WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:01.789
[crows cawing]

00:04.956 --> 00:06.414
There it is.

00:06.497 --> 00:08.539
The temple of
forgotten math books.

00:08.622 --> 00:11.330
You mean, "School where you happen
to always forget your math book"?

00:11.414 --> 00:14.248
It does start looking
creepier as the sun goes down.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.706
I hope Miss Camilichec's
room isn't locked.

00:16.789 --> 00:19.330
We might need the Great Key
Keeper to get in the classroom.

00:19.414 --> 00:20.998
-Who?
-Fred the janitor.

00:21.081 --> 00:24.081
Also known as "The Key Keeper."

00:24.164 --> 00:25.580
Because he has a lot of keys.

00:25.664 --> 00:27.872
He's a wise and mysterious force

00:27.956 --> 00:30.789
who guides us on quests
toward enlightenment.

00:30.872 --> 00:34.914
The janitor at my old school just
yelled at us and called us slobs.

00:40.414 --> 00:42.248
Oh, out of batteries.

00:45.123 --> 00:46.747
Hello?

00:46.831 --> 00:48.414
-Hello?
-Hello?

00:50.956 --> 00:53.123
-Hello, children.
-[all] Principal Milder!

00:53.206 --> 00:54.914
You kids are here a little late.

00:54.998 --> 00:57.414
I forgot a book that I
need for my homework.

00:57.497 --> 00:59.914
Again?
Melissa, I'm so disappointed.

01:00.123 --> 01:02.039
It's just in Ms. Camilichec's room.

01:02.123 --> 01:03.497
Oh, she locked up early.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.330
Er, can we turn
the hall lights on?

01:05.414 --> 01:09.081
No. We need to save money after
the school board bought that yacht.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.330
Step into my office,
we'll get that key.

01:15.123 --> 01:17.248
I'm giving you my only copy.

01:17.330 --> 01:18.914
And I'm saying thank you.

01:18.998 --> 01:21.497
Why are they describing
what they're doing?

01:21.580 --> 01:24.248
I once knew a kid who borrowed
one of my classroom keys

01:24.330 --> 01:25.497
and didn't return it.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.248
And do you know what
happened to that kid?

01:27.330 --> 01:29.414
-No.
-Okay, well, if you find out,

01:29.497 --> 01:31.956
tell them I would
like my keys back.

01:32.039 --> 01:35.747
Someday three children I know
will be sitting around saying,

01:35.831 --> 01:38.998
"Old Principal Milder,
she really taught us something."

01:39.081 --> 01:40.081
You mean us?

01:40.164 --> 01:42.039
Oh, no. Three other kids.

01:44.039 --> 01:47.414
[Zack] I could show you some techniques
to help you not forget stuff.

01:47.497 --> 01:49.081
Ooh, "Techniques"?

01:49.164 --> 01:51.414
You could make a list of
things you need to take home.

01:51.497 --> 01:53.747
-Oh, I made a list.
-And where is it now?

01:53.831 --> 01:56.123
I needed something to hold
the page in my math book.

01:56.206 --> 01:58.123
Here it is.
And here's the list I made.

01:58.206 --> 02:00.539
See? "Bring home math book."

02:00.622 --> 02:02.206
Lists don't work. Boom!

02:02.289 --> 02:05.455
Well, not if you leave them in the
thing, you were trying to remember.

02:08.455 --> 02:10.664
Zack, the key?
We need to lock the door.

02:10.747 --> 02:12.872
Oh, I saw it on
the desk in there.

02:14.497 --> 02:17.123
The good news is,
we have already locked the door.

02:17.206 --> 02:20.123
The bad news is,
we have already locked the door.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.956
No! I have to get her key back!

02:23.039 --> 02:26.580
I'm going to be the star of one
of her I-knew-a-kid-stories.

02:26.664 --> 02:30.123
Don't worry, no one ever knows what kid
she's talking about when she tells them.

02:30.206 --> 02:33.414
Looks like we're going to need
the Great Key Keeper after all.

02:33.497 --> 02:34.831
You're right.

02:34.914 --> 02:37.414
He can get us back in.
But he's impossible to find.

02:37.497 --> 02:40.164
Some say, he doesn't even exist.

02:40.248 --> 02:42.123
But you said he's the janitor.

02:42.206 --> 02:44.998
Some say,
I said he's the janitor.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.497
-It a quest!
-Yeah, a quest.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.789
Looking for the
janitor is a "quest?"

02:49.872 --> 02:51.497
Okay, do you want a quest or not?

02:51.580 --> 02:54.039
Because if not, there's a chair
right there with your name on it.

02:54.123 --> 02:55.664
Literally, in a heart.

02:57.248 --> 02:59.206
By the way,
I think that girl Crystal likes you.

02:59.289 --> 03:00.164
Wait. Which one is Crystal?

03:00.248 --> 03:01.831
The one that likes
you, apparently.

03:01.914 --> 03:04.455
Wait a minute! On the back
of this blank piece of paper.

03:04.539 --> 03:05.998
It's a map of the school!

03:06.081 --> 03:08.330
No, that blank piece of paper
is just the back of a map.

03:08.414 --> 03:09.831
What are the odds that
we would find this

03:09.914 --> 03:11.622
on the very evening
of our quest?

03:11.706 --> 03:14.039
Pretty high, since they
hand those out to everybody.

03:14.123 --> 03:16.081
Shh! The quest.

03:17.081 --> 03:18.164
Fred?

03:18.248 --> 03:20.914
Weird. The great key keeper
doesn't lock his own door.

03:20.998 --> 03:24.081
The Pyramids. Stonehenge.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.081
Well. Nothing lasts forever.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.081
There's gotta be a clue
around here somewhere.

03:32.164 --> 03:33.998
-[all gasps]
-[all] Mr. Drako?

03:34.081 --> 03:37.622
Oh, children. I stepped inside to
get a mop and I got locked inside.

03:37.706 --> 03:39.539
I've done that so many times.

03:39.622 --> 03:41.206
Hey! There's a note.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.414
"Children, follow the path
where your feet may squeak,

03:44.497 --> 03:47.206
only then will you receive
the object you seek."

03:47.289 --> 03:49.081
Ooh, cryptic!

03:49.164 --> 03:50.664
Why? Because it rhymes?

03:50.747 --> 03:53.330
Feet squeak on clean floors.

03:53.414 --> 03:55.039
He's cleaning the hallway!

03:55.123 --> 03:56.123
[all] The quest!

03:56.206 --> 03:58.081
[Zack] Also called just
"Looking for the janitor."

03:58.164 --> 03:59.164
[Melissa] Zack!

04:02.455 --> 04:03.664
[all clamoring]

04:06.455 --> 04:08.372
Man,
he gets these floors so clean.

04:08.455 --> 04:09.872
We're actually accelerating!

04:09.956 --> 04:11.539
[Melissa] Look out for the
Jefferson G. County statue!

04:11.622 --> 04:12.706
[all grunt]

04:12.789 --> 04:14.164
It's falling! [grunts]

04:16.789 --> 04:19.248
Is knocking over that
statue part of the "quest"?

04:19.330 --> 04:20.914
You don't have to
use air quotes.

04:20.998 --> 04:23.164
-I can't help it.
-Could be the quest.

04:23.248 --> 04:24.706
It could also be Murphy's Law, you know.

04:24.789 --> 04:26.580
Something that can go
wrong, going wrong.

04:26.664 --> 04:28.289
That's what makes it questy.

04:28.372 --> 04:30.248
-Stop making up words.
-[chuckles]

04:30.330 --> 04:32.123
The wet floors stop here.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.580
As if he vanished.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.123
Either that or he
did this area first,

04:36.206 --> 04:37.580
and it just had time to dry.

04:37.664 --> 04:39.289
-[pounding]
-Beat them. Knock them clean.

04:39.372 --> 04:40.455
[all coughs]

04:40.539 --> 04:42.248
The hall monitors are
cleaning the erasers! [coughs]

04:42.330 --> 04:44.123
Quick, put on these
dust-filtering masks.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.372
[Zack] And they have animal
faces on them because?

04:46.455 --> 04:49.372
[Milo] They serve a
variety of purposes.

04:49.455 --> 04:53.164
Beat them. Knock them clean.
Beat them like a tambourine.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.789
[Zack] It's jammed!

04:59.330 --> 05:01.289
It's like my dad always says,

05:01.372 --> 05:05.289
"The only way out is through
a creepy dark corridor."

05:13.414 --> 05:14.664
[quietly] Milo.

05:16.039 --> 05:18.330
Oh, that's just the school
Halloween decorations.

05:18.414 --> 05:20.289
[Zack] So,
these are just decorations too?

05:20.372 --> 05:22.206
-Oh, no, yours are real.
-[both scream]

05:22.289 --> 05:24.123
-Get them off!
-Get them off!

05:27.872 --> 05:29.039
Uh-oh.

05:29.123 --> 05:30.414
We're going to grow old in here,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.747
and they'll find us
when we're like, 24.

05:32.831 --> 05:36.580
And Principal Milder will still be
talking about how irresponsible I am!

05:36.664 --> 05:38.289
Hang on!

05:38.372 --> 05:41.289
I think I have something
that can get us out!

05:41.372 --> 05:43.289
So that's what our
student ID's are for.

05:44.580 --> 05:47.164
So this is the library.

05:47.248 --> 05:50.330
It's like the
Internet, but on paper.

05:51.747 --> 05:52.747
Hey, wait.

05:54.414 --> 05:56.039
One red book...

05:56.123 --> 05:57.330
[Zack] So how are
we going to get out?

05:57.414 --> 05:59.081
I think that was
our only way in.

05:59.580 --> 06:00.580
[screams]

06:01.580 --> 06:03.330
What were you doing?

06:03.414 --> 06:05.372
I was tilting a book to see if
there was a secret passageway.

06:05.455 --> 06:07.330
[crumbles]

06:07.414 --> 06:10.747
Wow... I was absolutely
sure that would not work.

06:17.414 --> 06:19.330
It's so dark in here.
I can't see anything.

06:19.414 --> 06:21.330
I got that covered.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.455
How's this going to work?

06:22.539 --> 06:24.455
I got a generator
in my backpack.

06:24.539 --> 06:26.248
You know, this reminds
me of the time my family

06:26.330 --> 06:29.039
and I fell into an undiscovered
Aztec temple and we had to...

06:29.123 --> 06:31.330
-[generator running]
-[inaudible]

06:44.747 --> 06:46.414
-[generator goes down]
-...the museum.

06:46.497 --> 06:48.206
Oh,
the generator ran out of gas.

06:48.289 --> 06:50.206
So the Mona Lisa that's
hanging in the Louvre

06:50.289 --> 06:52.372
right now isn't
even the real one?

06:52.455 --> 06:54.248
Nope. That was painted
by my cousin Reggie.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.872
Though to be fair,
Reggie is an above-average artist.

06:56.956 --> 06:59.580
Hey look, guys,
the Great Key Keeper left us a sign!

06:59.664 --> 07:01.747
Yes! I knew he
wouldn't let us down.

07:01.831 --> 07:04.497
-A mop bucket?
-No, not a mop bucket.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.664
A sign on the...

07:06.747 --> 07:09.164
-[sarcastically] Quest.
-Guys, up here!

07:16.789 --> 07:18.248
I've seen this before.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.455
Me too. Maybe in a dream.

07:22.789 --> 07:24.330
Or during second period.

07:25.206 --> 07:26.414
Goggles everyone!

07:26.497 --> 07:28.289
In case of a chemical splatter

07:28.372 --> 07:30.414
or Bunsen burner incident or...

07:30.497 --> 07:32.455
-[smashes]
-Ferret attack!

07:33.872 --> 07:36.580
[gasps] I'd just gotten
them down for the night.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.497
Sam, Betty, Jackie, Skylar!

07:40.497 --> 07:41.497
[Melissa] A clue!

07:42.497 --> 07:43.872
See. Goggles.

07:44.872 --> 07:46.414
You brought the ball back!

07:46.497 --> 07:49.123
[chuckles] Today
must be my lucky day.

07:49.206 --> 07:52.497
The janitor caught a pop fly up
on the roof only minutes ago.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.914
[all] Hey. It's like I've got a
whole new crop of outfielders.

07:55.998 --> 07:57.039
[groans]

07:57.123 --> 07:58.789
Please, please let that happen.

07:58.872 --> 08:00.330
Did you say the janitor
was on the roof?

08:00.414 --> 08:02.330
Well,
I assumed it was the janitor.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.372
I mean, I... I've never
really met the guy, you know.

08:04.455 --> 08:08.372
Although sometimes I swear he's
guiding me with little messages.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.747
-Is... Is that stupid?
-[both] No!

08:10.831 --> 08:12.455
Yeah,
I'm going to reserve comment.

08:13.831 --> 08:15.664
Well, no janitor. What now?

08:15.747 --> 08:17.580
I don't know,
I guess we go back to...

08:17.664 --> 08:19.497
Oh...

08:19.580 --> 08:22.455
I think this whole day was a lesson
about automatically locking doors.

08:22.539 --> 08:25.747
Hey! We're right over
Ms. Camilichec's classroom.

08:25.831 --> 08:26.914
Do you think...

08:26.998 --> 08:29.622
My dad always says
"When one door closes,

08:29.706 --> 08:32.956
there's usually access
through a vent in the roof."

08:33.039 --> 08:36.330
Oh, hey, my art pad,
I need that too.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.998
I forgot I even forgot that.

08:38.081 --> 08:39.081
Got it!

08:42.330 --> 08:43.330
[gasps]

08:45.497 --> 08:46.789
[Milo] Oh, it's the drama club.

08:46.872 --> 08:48.664
What's with the scary masks?

08:48.747 --> 08:50.789
We're doing commedia dell'arte.

08:50.872 --> 08:55.497
I'm Pantalone, the greedy
Venetian merchant. [snickering]

08:55.580 --> 08:56.414
Come back here!

08:57.414 --> 08:58.539
[wailing]

08:59.455 --> 09:00.622
[alarm ringing]

09:00.706 --> 09:03.330
Quiet everyone,
this is not a drill!

09:03.414 --> 09:05.330
Principal Milder,
it's not a fire.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.497
[Milo] Sorry, we...

09:06.580 --> 09:07.831
[Principal Milder] You know,
I once knew three children

09:07.914 --> 09:09.622
who didn't enact their
fire drill lessons

09:09.706 --> 09:11.039
and one day, those three...

09:14.664 --> 09:16.123
I said to them,

09:16.206 --> 09:17.831
"You think you're going to have it
better than this out in the wild,

09:17.914 --> 09:20.123
go ahead, run
free, fly the nest.

09:20.206 --> 09:22.580
But under my roof,
you'll obey my rules."

09:22.664 --> 09:24.872
-[ferrets sqeaking]
-And it was like, something clicked.

09:24.956 --> 09:29.206
Or maybe it's just that cheesy
cracker you got stuck to your foot.

09:29.289 --> 09:30.872
By the way,
while we were up on the roof,

09:30.956 --> 09:32.539
I put on a new coat of sealant.

09:32.622 --> 09:33.998
You know, I once knew a child

09:34.081 --> 09:36.539
who was always up on
roof tops sealing vents.

09:36.622 --> 09:37.664
Do you know what
happened to him?

09:37.747 --> 09:39.580
He's a successful contractor?

09:39.664 --> 09:42.372
Hmm... Interesting theory.

09:42.455 --> 09:43.998
Did you have fun on the "quest"?

09:44.081 --> 09:45.998
You mean the quest, no quotes.

09:46.081 --> 09:47.372
Yes, I did.

09:47.455 --> 09:49.123
But it's too bad,
we never meet the key keeper.

09:49.206 --> 09:52.539
Oh, come back!
I have more cheese crackers!

09:54.831 --> 09:57.039
It's you! The Great Key Keeper!

09:57.123 --> 09:58.747
-Fred the Janitor!
-Yes, hello.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.414
We really appreciate your help.

10:00.497 --> 10:02.580
My math book would thank
you if it could speak.

10:02.664 --> 10:04.580
I hereby bestow these treasures

10:04.664 --> 10:07.455
upon you and your trusty allies.

10:07.539 --> 10:09.330
We will treasure these always.

10:09.414 --> 10:10.497
That's fine.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.622
But first,
go help clean up the hallway.

10:12.706 --> 10:13.706
Okay, but hang on.

10:13.789 --> 10:14.956
-Zack! Over here!
-Zack! Zack!

10:15.039 --> 10:16.289
It's the Key Keeper, come here!

10:16.372 --> 10:17.622
The Great Key Keeper!

10:17.706 --> 10:18.539
He's gone.

10:19.664 --> 10:20.956
But he left us another sign.

10:21.039 --> 10:22.747
