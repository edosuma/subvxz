00:54.621 --> 00:57.657
I'm begging yo
let me out of here, please!

00:59.726 --> 01:03.029
Let me out of her
Let me go.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.567
Why are you doing this to me?

03:11.925 --> 03:14.394
When they come for you...

03:17.263 --> 03:19.065
kill yourselves!

03:22.101 --> 03:24.003
Or you'll end up like them.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.017
The girl...

03:41.454 --> 03:43.289
what will they do to her?

03:44.424 --> 03:46.526
She's the key to everything.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.933
They searched for her all ove
until they found her.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.603
What the he
is he talking about?

03:57.537 --> 04:00.273
Something's going
under the ground.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.355
No, no, no!

04:15.421 --> 04:16.356
Rojas?

04:17.290 --> 04:18.324
Rojas!

04:19.359 --> 04:20.627
Rojas...

04:26.633 --> 04:27.700
Rojas!

04:39.712 --> 04:40.647
Rojas!

11:17.610 --> 11:19.545
Don't wear yourself out.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.621
Save your energy.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.036
They're going to sho
all this bullshit,

11:44.103 --> 11:47.640
all this stupid fucking circu
right up your ass.

11:49.909 --> 11:53.212
They'll come for yo
they'll haul you away,

11:53.279 --> 11:56.382
and you'll rot in ja
for the rest of your life,

11:56.449 --> 11:59.151
yet, still jerking o
to the memories

11:59.218 --> 12:01.620
of these people bowing to you,

12:01.687 --> 12:04.123
of these poor bastar
kneeling before you.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.031
Who are "the poor" ones?

12:13.432 --> 12:14.500
These guys?

12:16.535 --> 12:17.603
No!

12:18.537 --> 12:20.439
I'm the one bowing to them.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.310
I'm the one working for them!

12:27.046 --> 12:29.615
Those who'd rather d
than give up...

12:30.449 --> 12:33.519
will come out on t
in this war.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.791
Winning battl
is not the thing here.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.393
You'll find no general
no leaders,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.763
no strategic moveme
of any sort here.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.868
Endurance, determinatio
that's what you'll see.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.605
Flesh... versus... steel.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.210
Throwing flesh at the minc
seems cruel to most.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.981
Yet, all changes in this wor
have just been attained...

13:03.749 --> 13:05.651
by pitting flesh against steel.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.154
There's no other way.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.658
Only fle
will make steel bend.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.430
What are you doing here?

13:21.066 --> 13:23.135
What brought y
all this way out here?

13:29.875 --> 13:32.111
I'm here to kill you
you crazy bastard.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.764
You think you're fighti
the bad guy?

13:53.032 --> 13:55.935
You think you're up again
the criminal, the monsters?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.075
Each new celebration,

14:04.276 --> 14:05.978
each new medal,

14:07.813 --> 14:10.049
makes you fe
like more of a hero?

14:11.817 --> 14:13.752
What a load of crap!

14:15.020 --> 14:18.490
You're nothing but a knif
cutting off rotting flesh.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.794
You kill to suppress...

14:22.428 --> 14:25.397
to hush up those memori
of death that haunt you...

14:26.899 --> 14:29.702
to gag the ghos
crying at you.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.105
You're an empty shell of a man.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.276
You can feel that rage in y
that won't go away...

14:38.777 --> 14:41.413
that hatred, which builds u
the flame guiding you.

15:18.717 --> 15:23.055
And even if you try to que
that howling with excuses...

15:26.825 --> 15:29.795
or you sit and wa
for that rage to lift away...

15:34.333 --> 15:35.434
the beast...

15:36.068 --> 15:37.136
will still be...

15:39.605 --> 15:40.873
in here!

15:50.316 --> 15:52.217
Us, killers, we're all the same.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.504
It's coming!

16:34.960 --> 16:35.894
No.

16:37.796 --> 16:38.731
No!

16:54.413 --> 16:56.648
No!

17:06.392 --> 17:07.626
No, no, no!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.161
No, no.

17:09.628 --> 17:10.629
No, no.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.831
No!

17:23.242 --> 17:25.310
Easy, Pardita, easy.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.333
They won't be coming.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.584
Please, forgive me.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.557
I'm truly sorr
but I can't take you with me.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.727
Forgive me, Pardita.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.459
No!

18:47.926 --> 18:49.328
No!

19:47.486 --> 19:48.887
Eh?

20:12.177 --> 20:13.212
Hey?

23:17.162 --> 23:18.196
Rojas!

23:20.966 --> 23:21.900
Rojas?

23:23.335 --> 23:24.469
Rojas!

23:28.106 --> 23:29.174
Rojas!

23:30.842 --> 23:32.077
Rojas!

23:40.952 --> 23:42.187
Rojas!

23:44.890 --> 23:46.358
You bastards!

30:21.252 --> 30:22.821
I'll get you out of here.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.694
Hey...

34:28.332 --> 34:29.400
Hey?

34:31.269 --> 34:32.437
Hey...

34:34.238 --> 34:35.473
Rojas...

35:09.107 --> 35:11.676
It's so great to see you, bro.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.359
Please, forgive me.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.264
Where's Flor?

35:35.633 --> 35:37.034
Where is she?

35:38.269 --> 35:39.470
I don't know.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.377
-When did I get her
-Two days ago.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.847
I was all by myself?

35:57.922 --> 36:00.992
Rojas, where are the others?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.535
Castillo was still ali
when I last saw him.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.706
But Doc and Par
stayed back in the swamp.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.710
That's all I kno
What about you? What happened?

36:22.413 --> 36:23.414
I...

36:25.316 --> 36:27.718
I lost my w
in the middle of the jungle.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.721
I kept moving Wes
trying to hit the border,

36:30.788 --> 36:32.123
but I never made it.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.826
It was like going rou
in circles,

36:35.893 --> 36:38.462
always winding
at the same starting point.

36:39.063 --> 36:40.998
I was exhauste
I collapsed.

36:41.065 --> 36:42.733
Next mornin
I woke up in here.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.838
They get the si
out of the jungle.

36:50.975 --> 36:52.009
Who?

36:52.944 --> 36:54.045
The nuns.

36:56.414 --> 36:57.648
Take a look around.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.052
These guys are all sick as hell.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.756
Their eyes are all re
just like Pardo's.

37:07.758 --> 37:08.993
So, how are you doing?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.965
Any vomiting, any dizzy spells?

37:17.668 --> 37:18.936
Are you sure?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.739
Are you absolutely sure, Rojas?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.108
Look at me, come on!

37:29.547 --> 37:31.349
Come with me, Rojas.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.120
-N
-Come on! Come on!

37:38.723 --> 37:40.024
You'd better lie down.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.360
-Cool i
-No!

37:43.894 --> 37:48.466
Calm down. Breath
Rojas, breathe, bro, breathe.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.335
-Calm down! Eas
-It hurts!

37:51.669 --> 37:53.738
Easy, easy, easy!

37:55.539 --> 37:56.641
Calm down!

38:09.320 --> 38:11.255
There. It's okay. It's okay.

38:15.693 --> 38:18.829
No, don't! Calm dow
It's me, DÃ­az!

38:19.196 --> 38:21.432
Calm down, Roja
Calm down!
