00:08.876 --> 00:12.746
( "Everybody Wants to Rule
the World" plays )

00:19.620 --> 00:23.824
* Welcome to your life

00:23.857 --> 00:28.829
* There's no turning back

00:28.862 --> 00:32.833
* Even while we sleep

00:32.866 --> 00:35.636
* We will find you

00:35.669 --> 00:38.239
* Acting on your best...

00:38.272 --> 00:40.508
You coming in?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.210
I think I'm going
to stay in the car.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.680
Charlie, you'll
get them next time.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.689
Hey, how're you
doing, Mr. Eppes?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.425
Oh, good, Victor.
And you?

00:57.458 --> 00:58.726
Great. How's
your boys?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.828
Uh, actually,
Charlie's in the car.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.296
What, he doesn't
want to come in?

01:02.330 --> 01:04.432
He hit into a double-play today.

01:04.465 --> 01:08.102
You tell Charlie it's his brains
that got him where he is today.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.171
-Not baseball.
-Right.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.806
Um, I'll take, uh...
a dozen franks

01:12.840 --> 01:15.709
and, um, I don't know,
a couple of rib-eye.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.710
MAN:
Give me the money.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.511
( woman gasps )

01:17.545 --> 01:18.846
-Come on, hurry up!
-Okay, okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.317
-I said, hurry up!
-Okay. Okay.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.885
-What do you want?
-Nothing. Just take it easy.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.687
Come on, all of it.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.755
Theresa.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.722
Daddy!

01:28.756 --> 01:30.458
Stay where you are!

01:30.491 --> 01:31.492
Stay there or I'll kill her.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.594
I swear to God.

01:33.627 --> 01:34.562
Charlie!

01:34.595 --> 01:35.563
Dad!

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
Charlie, get out of here!

01:36.597 --> 01:37.665
( gunshot )

01:38.799 --> 01:40.334
Dad!

01:40.368 --> 01:42.703
Dad!

01:42.736 --> 01:44.638
-Dad!
-( groans )

01:44.672 --> 01:46.707
Dad!

01:46.740 --> 01:49.343
-Dad!
-( groans ): I'm all right.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.678
I'm fine,
I just have to catch my breath.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.448
Call an ambulance!

01:54.482 --> 01:55.816
Where is your mother?

01:55.849 --> 01:57.685
I-I need your mother...

01:57.718 --> 01:59.687
Dad...

01:59.720 --> 02:01.355
Charlie...?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.692
Charlie...

02:04.725 --> 02:06.494
WOMAN:
Charlie.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.196
Charlie.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.164
Charlie, come on, wake up.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.904
You're gonna be
late for class.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.251
Mom?

02:30.284 --> 02:31.752
Oh, there you are.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.421
Hurry up,
everything's getting cold.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.756
Is it really you?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.858
Of course it's me, silly.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.864
-You made pancakes.
-Sit.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.866
We don't have a lot of time.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.774
-Here you go.
-Mom, what are you doing here?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.545
I made you breakfast.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.749
But I meant here... here.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.885
You know I can't tell you that,
Charlie.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.854
Well, where have you been?

03:08.956 --> 03:12.793
I just thought it
was time, that's all.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.295
Time for what?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.697
You needed to see me.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.232
I did?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.301
Mm-hmm.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.803
There's a question that you've
been wanting to ask me.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.673
A question?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.675
Better hurry, sweets.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.809
I have to go soon.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.379
Wait.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.314
I'll just put this
in the fridge.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.549
What question?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.551
It'll come to you.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.520
What question?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.961
Did you figure
it out yet, Charlie?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.997
Charlie?

03:50.030 --> 03:51.632
Charlie.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.501
Charlie, get up.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.802
Come on, you said you'd
drop me at the metro.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.770
I've got to be
downtown in 45 minutes.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.739
Let's go, come
on, chop-chop.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.591
( indistinct background
radio communication )

04:26.700 --> 04:28.736
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.371
COLBY:
This is Carla Daniels.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.406
This is her house,
she lives here alone.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.007
No sign of a struggle.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.344
Her keys were still
in the ignition.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.678
Yeah, who found her?

04:37.711 --> 04:38.946
Her mailman.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.014
Woman, whatever you
want to call her.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.950
How about postal
carrier, Granger?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.585
What do you say, Megan?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.853
She was found
the same way

04:45.886 --> 04:47.955
the other girl was
six weeks ago.

04:47.988 --> 04:48.956
You guys talk
to the neighbors?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.691
The guy across the street.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.326
He says the car's
been here all morning.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.861
With her in it?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.963
DAVID:
Can't remember.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.865
Just another sunny day in L.A.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.899
All right. Well, start
canvassing the area.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.801
We need permits here,
so run parking tickets.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.504
They probably didn't walk away,
right?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.105
Could be, she did it to herself?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.840
See how pretty she looks,
Granger?

05:08.576 --> 05:10.077
She didn't dress
for a suicide.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.045
She dressed for a somebody.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.551
CHARLIE:
I'll tell you, it was weird.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.753
It's been four years.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.921
I forgot what
she looks like.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.956
Listen,
I completely understand.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.825
My own mother
passed years ago.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.496
Now all I can recall
is this warm smile of hers

05:28.529 --> 05:31.599
and a set
of oddly tweezed eyebrows.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.834
-It was nice seeing her, though.
-Yeah.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.036
And you said
that she told you

05:36.069 --> 05:39.072
there was some question
that you had for her?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.509
Yeah, what do you
think that's about?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.044
All depends on what school
of dreams you ascribe to.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.679
School of dreams...

05:45.713 --> 05:48.849
Whether it's due to some random
neuro-synaptic firings,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.518
In other words,
they have no meaning.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.853
Or, you know,
maybe they're revelations

05:52.886 --> 05:55.456
of some hidden
subconscious conflict.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.559
Residue of unprocessed emotions.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.060
What side of that fence
do you sit on?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.962
Oh, I rarely dream.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.164
I mean, every once in a while,
I have this recurring dream

06:04.197 --> 06:07.701
in which my Aunt Louise is
attempting to consume my flesh,

06:07.735 --> 06:10.671
but as a general
rule, no.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.939
I like to think it's because
I live in the moment,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.541
but of course it
could be due to some

06:13.574 --> 06:15.909
greater neuro-chemical
imbalance.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.513
That certainly might
explain some things.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.915
But we're exploring your journey
here, Charles, not mine.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.551
Exactly.

06:23.584 --> 06:31.592
But... what is it?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.661
( phone rings )

06:33.694 --> 06:35.629
COLBY:
Granger.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.701
I will call you
right back.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.071
Anything?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.506
You make your bed
in the morning?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.040
Not usually.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.610
Tells you a lot about a person.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.945
I have somebody who comes in.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.982
She read the Bible.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.049
So she says
her prayers

06:56.083 --> 06:58.519
and makes her bed;
you ready to name her killer?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.523
She was organized and tidy.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.757
Neither of those traits

07:03.791 --> 07:05.659
are really consistent
with a risk-taker.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.095
So?

07:08.128 --> 07:11.131
So I think whoever did this,
she trusted him.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.966
How about an ex-boyfriend?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.068
That's what I was thinking.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.236
That was David.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.771
Neighbor said she broke it off

07:17.805 --> 07:18.972
a few weeks ago.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.174
Sounds like motive to me, but it
was fun watching you work.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.877
( laughs )

07:23.911 --> 07:25.813
And, really, call me

07:25.846 --> 07:27.147
as soon as you know
anything, all right?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.683
-Don.
-Hey, what's up?

07:29.717 --> 07:32.085
Um, I have something
I want to talk to you about.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.621
-You busy?
-No, I mean,

07:33.654 --> 07:35.255
we just got handed this
homicide from these locals

07:35.288 --> 07:36.990
who think it's connected
to a prior murder.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.726
Here, you want
to take a look?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.928
-Yeah, sure.
-What's up?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.931
Um... I had a, uh...

07:43.964 --> 07:45.766
-I had a dream.
-Oh, yeah?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.167
A dream?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.802
I know it sounds...

07:48.836 --> 07:50.804
These are our two victims
right here.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.273
CHARLIE:
Wow.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.775
They're pretty young.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.810
Yeah, 23, 24.
Both found in their cars

07:56.844 --> 07:58.679
in their driveways,
both OD'd on hot shots

07:58.712 --> 08:00.781
of diazepam and morphine.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.550
The coroner ruled
the first girl an accident

08:02.583 --> 08:03.917
until the second girl showed up.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.118
Do we know of any connection
between them?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.688
Well, I mean, it doesn't seem
like they knew each other.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.256
This girl, Lisa Clark,
I think she was a salesgirl,

08:09.289 --> 08:10.524
and Carla Daniels,
a real estate broker.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.160
And somewhere their killer must
have come in contact with them.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.629
Yep.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.798
Okay, you know, uh,
there's something called

08:17.831 --> 08:20.200
-a Direct Network Flow problem.
-Uh-huh.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.869
Is this good or bad for me?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.003
Oh, it's good

08:23.036 --> 08:24.838
because these women
had daily routines.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.708
So the repetition
of those routines

08:27.741 --> 08:29.743
would have narrowed
the opportunity

08:29.777 --> 08:31.579
for a killer to come
into contact with them.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.946
It's like being in the kitchen.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.047
Every day, you're in that room

08:34.081 --> 08:35.282
traveling from the table

08:35.315 --> 08:37.751
to the sink, to the fridge,

08:37.785 --> 08:40.053
back to the sink,
back to the table and so on.

08:40.087 --> 08:44.324
In these routine movements,
there are unconscious patterns.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.994
Paths you take dictated
by convenience

08:47.027 --> 08:48.896
or by a specific task.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.331
If you were to record
these movements,

08:51.364 --> 08:52.766
you would see those patterns.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.168
So, if you can get
me any information

08:55.202 --> 08:56.904
about these women's
daily lives,

08:56.937 --> 09:00.073
then I can analyze their
more traveled routes,

09:00.107 --> 09:02.876
and find a location where
they and their killer

09:02.910 --> 09:04.344
were most likely
to intersect.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.779
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.015
So, uh, tell me
about your dream.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.752
Uh... Dad got shot.

09:13.020 --> 09:13.987
During a holdup

09:14.021 --> 09:16.089
in a grocery store.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.325
It was pretty upsetting.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.827
Yeah, I'm sure.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.964
Then Mom made pancakes.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.199
Pancakes.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.804
I don't even dream normal.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.041
It's hard to believe
she's dead.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.143
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

09:36.176 --> 09:39.112
Oh, about...

09:39.146 --> 09:40.714
three weeks ago.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.016
Is that when
she broke up with you?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.184
Carla didn't break up with me.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.819
It was a mutual agreement.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.688
Uh-huh.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.922
How long did
you know her?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.158
About a year.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.894
Do you read the Bible, Mr. Gill?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.729
Is that a problem?

09:55.763 --> 09:56.964
No, it's not a problem.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.366
It's just, Carla Daniels had
an identical copy at her house.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.669
I gave it to her.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.236
What else did you give her?

10:03.270 --> 10:06.039
What's that supposed to mean?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.375
It means, what was the exact
nature of your friendship?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.679
We were Christians.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.080
And?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.347
And we didn't believe
in pre-marital sex,

10:14.381 --> 10:15.783
if that's where this is going.

10:15.816 --> 10:16.784
COLBY:
Sex? No.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.318
Nobody said anything about sex.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.987
You just asked me...

10:20.020 --> 10:21.221
See, you're trying
to twist my words.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.990
Take it easy,
Mr. Gill.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.291
No. I know
what you're doing, okay?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.325
You're trying to make it seem

10:25.358 --> 10:27.094
like I had something to do
with Carla's murder.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.329
Did you have something to do
with Carla's murder?

10:29.362 --> 10:33.033
I want you to leave,
both of you.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.367
Now.

10:34.401 --> 10:39.039
That's not a very
Christian attitude, Mr. Gill.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.176
MEGAN:
The autopsy suggests

10:43.210 --> 10:44.978
the diazepam was given orally,

10:45.012 --> 10:47.014
and then they were
injected with morphine.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.149
He calmed them,
and then he killed them.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.317
So what do we got,
serial killer?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.886
Well, it's a little
early to tell.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.388
But driving them both back
to their homes in their cars

10:55.422 --> 10:58.358
suggests postmortem staging.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.860
Colby likes
the boyfriend for it.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.394
Yeah? And why's that?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.031
Guy claims him and Carla Daniels
agreed not to have sex.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.265
And in
Granger's mind,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.100
that immediately
makes him a suspect.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.036
Yep. That and this.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.038
Turns out Mr. Gill
called Carla Daniels

11:11.071 --> 11:12.339
the night she was killed.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.841
DAVID:
Told us he hadn't

11:13.874 --> 11:14.875
spoken to her in weeks.

11:14.908 --> 11:15.809
And he's got a client that works

11:15.843 --> 11:17.745
less than two blocks away
from the store

11:17.778 --> 11:19.012
where the first victim worked.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.047
And, yeah,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.449
no guy agrees not to have sex.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.723
Thomas Gill, FBI!

11:29.757 --> 11:30.724
Open up.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.725
Who is it?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.961
FBI.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.799
We have a warrant to
search your apartment.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.067
GILL:
Wait, what is this?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.068
DAVID:
I'll take the back.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.069
I have the computer.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.070
GILL:
What'd I do?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.304
You lied, Thomas.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.106
We happen to know
you called Carla

11:46.139 --> 11:49.309
the night she disappeared.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.182
DAVID:
Guys.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.416
Take a look.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.736
Oh, ye of little faith.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.548
I didn't remember
making the call.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.550
45-minute conversation.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.020
Look, I would never hurt Carla.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.823
So all this and you two never...

12:35.856 --> 12:38.025
No, listen,
I told you.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.459
It had nothing
to do with her.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.394
Well, it was your stuff, Thomas.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.034
I mean, all those nights

12:47.067 --> 12:48.501
that she sent you home...

12:51.872 --> 12:53.206
It wasn't fair.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.975
I'm sure.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.877
I loved her.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.578
But she said "no."

12:58.611 --> 13:01.448
Told me I wasn't the one.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.050
Yeah?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.217
I just

13:04.251 --> 13:06.019
wanted her to understand.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.389
That's why I screamed at her.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.293
God, I'm so sorry.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.595
Hey, look, you got a chance
to make it right.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.431
Right?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.867
What are you talking about?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.101
You screamed, and then what?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.102
What happened?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.004
Nothing. Nothing.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.039
Nothing happened.
This was on the phone.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.074
I screamed at her
on the telephone.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.242
Right. Then you went there
and you killed her.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.045
No! I swear to God, I didn't!

13:35.548 --> 13:37.918
I didn't remember
making the call.

13:42.089 --> 13:49.162
* She's got the suntan,
the presence of the earth *

13:49.196 --> 13:52.365
* She's a cold, cold television
set and she's my best friend *

13:54.902 --> 13:59.206
* I've got my great brain,
I start changing mine *

13:59.239 --> 14:02.943
* I got the left side talking
to the right *

14:02.976 --> 14:05.045
* On the other line.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.384
Hi.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.520
"Mom.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.587
"Dad.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.488
"Robbery.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.157
Pancakes"?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.391
Charlie, what is this?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.493
I'm analyzing
a dream I had.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.663
You're applying math
to your dream?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.598
Activation Synthesis Theory.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.400
When we sleep,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.169
our brain continues
to receive signals,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.570
but because we're unconscious,

14:30.603 --> 14:34.041
it tries to structure
our thoughts

14:34.074 --> 14:36.009
into some sort of association.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.111
Why is this dream so important?

14:38.145 --> 14:41.048
It's the first dream I've had
about my Mom since she died.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.423
You know they did a study
at Harvard

14:50.457 --> 14:53.994
about people who weren't very
good at unscrambling anagrams

14:54.027 --> 14:56.930
who were wakened
during REM sleep

14:56.964 --> 15:00.033
and were actually able
to do a much better job.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.136
Maybe in a dream
you just let go.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.106
Harvard, huh?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.343
You call about that job yet?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.112
No.

15:12.145 --> 15:12.779
It's not easy

15:12.812 --> 15:14.081
figuring things out, is it?

15:18.151 --> 15:20.988
Speaking of figuring things out,
how's Don's case?

15:21.021 --> 15:23.256
I don't have enough information.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.124
These women lived alone

15:24.157 --> 15:26.126
and their families lived
out of state.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.061
What about where they worked?

15:28.095 --> 15:30.563
I mean,

15:30.597 --> 15:31.764
if they're anything like us,

15:31.798 --> 15:34.501
those are probably the people
who knew them best, right?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.743
Turns out Gil
was telling the truth.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.112
He's got a solid alibi

15:45.145 --> 15:47.514
for the night
Lisa Clark was murdered.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.982
So he's not our guy?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.984
Doesn't look like it.

15:51.018 --> 15:54.487
Lisa Clark, who's 23 years old.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.056
She'd just graduated college.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.226
She left work to meet some
friends and never made it.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.395
Bet she never thought something
like this could happen to her.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.131
Well, unfortunately,
there are people out there

16:04.164 --> 16:07.034
who don't give a damn whether
your thought about it or not.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.037
And Carla Daniels...

16:10.070 --> 16:11.404
told her boss
she wasn't feeling well.

16:11.438 --> 16:15.208
Went home, put on a sexy little
T-shirt and skirt.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.777
Well, obviously she was feeling
better.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.080
I called her sisters
in Missouri.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.581
She talked to them
every day...

16:21.614 --> 16:22.682
except this day.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.652
So whoever this was, she was
keeping him a secret.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.359
What's up?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.360
( computer trills )

16:33.393 --> 16:35.195
See this area?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.164
Yeah. Her shoes?

16:40.567 --> 16:43.270
They're on the
wrong feet.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.338
We've already checked
for DNA.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.175
MEGAN:
I'm not looking for DNA.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.677
Want to tell us exactly what it
is you are looking for?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.045
Her makeup was perfect,

16:52.079 --> 16:53.813
but her shoes were on
the wrong feet.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.781
I'm not buying it.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.218
This guy made a mistake.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.821
See that?

17:01.854 --> 17:03.623
Yeah. What is it?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.258
It's makeup.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.427
Only she wouldn't have
put it on

17:07.460 --> 17:09.096
before putting
her T-shirt on.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.631
Right, 'cause when
she pulled it over her head...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.300
You'd get makeup
on the inside collar.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.335
So this guy dressed her.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.137
When she was already dead.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.438
COLBY:
I don't get it.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.208
What kind of guy
puts makeup on a dead girl?

17:21.241 --> 17:22.809
He's creating an image
for himself.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.377
DON:
All right, so elaborate on that.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.180
Well, you take a dead girl and
you dump her in a ditch,

17:27.214 --> 17:29.082
you're saying, "Look
at what a bad-ass I am."

17:29.116 --> 17:30.683
You dress one up,
you take her home,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.819
you're saying, "Look at
what a nice person I am."

17:32.852 --> 17:35.222
It's almost like he's on a date.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.490
Remind me not to set you up
with any of my friends.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.858
There's no struggle.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.792
There's no bruises,
there's no marks,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.528
so either he has a weapon
he didn't use...

17:41.561 --> 17:43.196
-...or he already knows them.
-Right.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.731
That's what Gil
wouldn't tell you--

17:44.764 --> 17:46.566
that Carla Daniels was
seeing someone else.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.201
All right.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.170
Don, LAPD just found
another girl.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.607
Mr. and Mrs. Brewer, they're the
couple that live here.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.209
This isn't her home?

17:56.243 --> 17:59.446
Never seen her before.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.114
What do you think
of a copycat, maybe?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.315
What do you mean?

18:02.349 --> 18:03.883
We weren't giving out
any details.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.253
So it's got
to be our guy.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.255
Why would he
bring her here?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.490
'Cause that's what he does,
he brings them home.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
Yeah, but this isn't her home.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.660
Check out
that makeup job.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.295
It's nowhere near
as good, right?

18:19.932 --> 18:23.603
All right, so best guess,
he's just going on instinct.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.405
The other two murders,
they were weeks apart

18:25.438 --> 18:26.839
they were well planned out.

18:26.873 --> 18:27.974
He could've

18:28.007 --> 18:30.277
just picked her up off
the street and took his chances.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.681
Which means he won't stop
until we stop him.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.790
Okay, now this is interesting.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.657
What, did you find
something?

18:44.691 --> 18:47.260
Yeah, three-bedroom
in West Covina.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.763
That small a yard and this
thing is seven figures?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.399
Larry, let's just please
try to focus.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.902
Charles, we have, we have
examined every aspect

18:55.935 --> 18:57.204
of this woman's life.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.771
So, what?
You're giving up?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.240
No, I'm just not sure

19:00.273 --> 19:02.842
that more data is all
that's required here.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.544
-Hi, all.
-Hi.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.278
Hey.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.313
Find anything?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.780
Yeah, apparently,

19:07.814 --> 19:08.848
she had a really annoying chair.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.617
Also, she gets a lot
of phone calls.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.453
She had 22 messages
in voice mail.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.654
14 of which I've returned.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.723
We're returning phone calls?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.391
Well, yeah. Don said
that'd be okay.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.493
Well, Charlie wanted
to hear their voices.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.861
Inflections,

19:21.894 --> 19:23.430
to determine
the level of intimacy.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.497
The greater the familiarity,

19:24.531 --> 19:26.699
the higher the value in my
Directed Network Flow.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.601
I was trying to explain
to Charles

19:28.635 --> 19:30.737
the basic flaw
in his methodology.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.405
CHARLIE:
Flaw in

19:32.439 --> 19:33.840
in my methodology?

19:33.873 --> 19:34.574
LARRY:
Charles, we've been exploring

19:34.607 --> 19:36.409
the universe
of this woman's life

19:36.443 --> 19:38.345
with no notion
of significance.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.447
AMITA:
Larry's right, Charlie.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.614
In the hunt for a supernova,

19:41.648 --> 19:44.451
even astrophysicists apply
some limit on their search.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.818
RIght. I mean,
case in point.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.288
The Katzman Automatic Imaging
Telescope takes

19:48.321 --> 19:50.323
no more than 100 photographs
an hour.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.991
And if I was hunting
supernoavae,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.527
then, yes, a time limitation
would make sense,

19:54.561 --> 19:56.229
but in this case,

19:56.263 --> 19:58.398
we have no idea when
this woman met her attacker.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.332
No, actually, we do.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.601
Her ex told Don
she had just met someone.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.970
Someone she didn't tell anyone
about.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.438
Okay, so we limit

20:05.472 --> 20:06.539
the assignment of edge
capacities,

20:06.573 --> 20:11.378
the times that she could
have moved along these paths

20:11.411 --> 20:12.412
to the last three weeks.

20:12.445 --> 20:16.483
Isn't that a
little haphazard?

20:16.516 --> 20:19.386
Yeah, well, haphazard may be
exactly what we're looking for.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.787
MEGAN:
How so?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.622
That vacuum.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.425
That vacuum works
on cyclonic technology.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.461
Constant suction is maintained
by mini tornados

20:28.495 --> 20:31.531
in a series of tubes
that separate the dirt from air

20:31.564 --> 20:32.932
using centrifugal force.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.702
But if you wanted to determine
the path of an actual tornado,

20:35.735 --> 20:37.370
you would focus on
the landscape

20:37.404 --> 20:38.638
and lower atmosphere.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.508
Its path is determined by
a variety of factors:

20:41.541 --> 20:45.545
weather conditions, elevation
and presence of any structures

20:45.578 --> 20:46.946
or bodies of water.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.350
It's called Kernel Density
Estimation.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.820
And what you do is you divide
the landscape

20:53.853 --> 20:56.823
and lower atmosphere
into squares or bins.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.326
And the more you learn
about each one,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.328
the more accurate
your prediction's going to be.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.030
So when the tornado veers
off its path,

21:04.063 --> 21:05.532
you know something's missing.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.567
Right. So we don't need
to know

21:07.600 --> 21:10.303
every detail
of this woman's life.

21:10.337 --> 21:14.674
We just need to find that spot
where the flow changed course.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.644
So Charlie was right.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.679
There was a change
in Carla's routine.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.481
She hurt herself snowboarding
a month ago.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.782
Stopped going to her
regular gym

21:22.815 --> 21:23.850
and started going
to Pilates.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.817
To rehab.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.020
Yeah, and there was
a message at her office

21:28.054 --> 21:29.021
the day she disappeared.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.558
There was a cancellation
at the Pilates studio.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.493
Which is why she
left work early.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.095
Yeah, and where her life
veered off course.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.965
I had a cancellation, so I had
the office try Carla.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.700
She'd been trying
to see me all week.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.502
She was definitely
here then?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.003
45-minute
reformer session.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.805
Which means she left
about an hour later?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.374
She say where
she was going?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.376
Actually, she didn't
leave right away.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.577
What do you mean?

21:50.610 --> 21:52.579
Well, I was with
my next client

21:52.612 --> 21:54.547
and Carla got
into a conversation.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.615
With your client?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.749
With her son.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.718
He usually hangs out
till she's through.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.119
She had a hip replacement
awhile back.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.554
What's the son's name?

22:01.588 --> 22:03.390
I'm not sure.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.757
But my client's name
is Charlotte Yates.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.494
Thank you.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.628
Yates...

22:08.661 --> 22:10.397
What's up?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.532
Those parking tickets we ran
down on the second victim.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.667
Yeah, the ones without
the residential sticker.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.403
Yeah, Charlotte Yates--

22:16.436 --> 22:19.038
one of the names on
the vehicle registration.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.551
You let Charlie
buy the house, huh?

22:33.420 --> 22:35.422
Margaret?

22:35.455 --> 22:37.390
Relax. You're
just having a dream.

22:37.424 --> 22:41.628
I see you restored
the shelving.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.663
Oh, yes.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.364
Um...

22:48.568 --> 22:50.437
And for the record,

22:50.470 --> 22:52.171
I didn't realize Charlie
was the one

22:52.204 --> 22:54.073
who bought the house from me.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.576
You really think that's best--
living in this house?

22:56.609 --> 22:57.644
Charlie's a grown man.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.846
I have no control over
where he decides to live.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.948
I meant you.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.552
Oh, uh...

23:05.585 --> 23:06.553
Well, it's, um...

23:06.586 --> 23:09.155
Comfortable?

23:09.188 --> 23:11.724
I worry about you

23:11.758 --> 23:13.560
not moving on, you know.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.528
Taking changes again.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.930
I'm doing all right.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.600
The caterer?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.602
It's not serious.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.673
Charlie says you told him

23:26.706 --> 23:28.708
he has a question
he wants to ask you?

23:28.741 --> 23:32.078
Well, we always knew
it was coming.

23:32.111 --> 23:36.483
We did the best we could
with them.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.684
Right?

23:37.717 --> 23:40.553
They are both
very fine men.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.522
Yeah.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.091
Yeah, they are.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.695
You give Don my love.

23:48.728 --> 23:49.929
Yes, always.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.665
I just want you all
to be happy.

23:52.699 --> 23:56.603
Then you shouldn't have died.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.647
She seemed like
a very sweet girl.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.949
You knew her then?

24:09.982 --> 24:13.019
On occasion,
our appointments overlapped.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.488
Is this your son,
Mrs. Yates?

24:15.522 --> 24:18.057
Yes.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.627
He's a handsome boy.

24:20.660 --> 24:24.664
Chandler is almost
40 years old.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.767
Is he here?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.802
No. Chandler does not
live at home.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.103
Oh? Where does he live?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.739
At the beach house.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.439
Why?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.075
Do you own a Lexus, Mrs. Yates?

24:36.108 --> 24:37.810
It's registered
in my name,

24:37.844 --> 24:39.512
but that's
Chandler's car.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.580
By any chance

24:40.613 --> 24:42.248
did you ever give Carla
a ride home?

24:42.281 --> 24:43.516
Ride home?

24:43.550 --> 24:45.184
I barely know her.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.919
Plus, I don't drive.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.788
You've lived in Los Angeles
all your life

24:48.821 --> 24:49.889
and you don't drive?

24:49.922 --> 24:52.058
My husband drove
me around.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.227
Now Chandler takes me
wherever I need to go.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.829
Besides,

24:56.863 --> 24:58.898
I'm on medication.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.633
Oh, yeah?

25:00.667 --> 25:01.868
Since my hip surgery,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.903
I find it difficult
to get comfortable.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.237
I even take a little Valium

25:05.271 --> 25:06.238
to go to sleep.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.574
Diazepam.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.176
Morphine was knocking me
for a loop.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.180
Is this you,

25:14.213 --> 25:15.715
Mrs. Yates?

25:15.748 --> 25:19.552
I did a little modeling
when I was younger.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.120
MEGAN: Do you know where
your son is now?

25:21.153 --> 25:22.054
No.

25:22.088 --> 25:26.092
We don't see that much
of each other anymore.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.563
I'm afraid that we had a...
a falling out.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.131
And what was that about?

25:32.164 --> 25:34.300
Chandler's trust fund--
what else.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.803
A certain amount
was to be transferred

25:36.836 --> 25:38.004
to him on his birthday.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.338
I didn't feel
he was ready.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.208
All that gallivanting
around.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.242
Naturally, he was upset.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.177
I told him the same thing
I told his father--

25:45.211 --> 25:48.114
the spigot doesn't stay
turned on forever.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.716
When was that exactly?

25:49.749 --> 25:52.785
Six weeks ago.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.277
Come out here.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.613
-What the...?
-Where's Chandler?

26:20.647 --> 26:21.347
He's not here.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.082
When's the last time
you saw him?

26:23.115 --> 26:24.250
This morning.
What's going on?

26:24.283 --> 26:25.985
-You live here?
-With Chandler. Why?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.119
Where's he at?

26:27.153 --> 26:28.387
He... he went surfing.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.156
-When's he supposed to be back?
-I don't know.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.858
He might have
stopped off for a drink.

26:31.891 --> 26:32.892
Yeah? Where would
that be?

26:32.925 --> 26:35.161
John's-- it's on Treemont.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.395
I'll call them.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.164
All right,
stay with her.

26:49.776 --> 26:50.877
David, how you doing?
You clear?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.211
No sign of him, Don.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.646
All right, come on out front.
We're clear here.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.047
Hold on, we just found
something back here

26:55.081 --> 26:56.749
I think you should
take a look at.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.017
All right, I'm on my way.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.086
What's in there?

27:00.119 --> 27:01.320
I can't really see,

27:01.353 --> 27:02.288
but something seems weird.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.126
I mean, there could be
girls in there, right?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.316
Lights, camera, action.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.758
* ...in the air

27:38.791 --> 27:41.794
* And music fills my heart...

27:41.828 --> 27:44.697
Shh. She's fast asleep.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.735
Girl's not sleeping.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.070
She's unconscious.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.238
Yeah, drugged, huh?

27:55.007 --> 27:58.177
Now she's ready to do
anything I say,

27:58.210 --> 28:00.079
anything I want.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.317
How many women
you think he did this to?

28:05.351 --> 28:11.123
* Here we are,
together again... *

28:11.157 --> 28:12.759
Want to see?

28:16.462 --> 28:19.131
What I want to see
is you fry.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.300
Is this a fairly
typical crowd?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.936
Yeah, mostly
college kids.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.905
This guy's not in college.
He's in his 40's.

28:25.938 --> 28:26.939
Oh, Chandler.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.140
Yeah, I've seen him.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.108
Oh, yeah?
When was that?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.109
A couple hours ago.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.110
Uh-huh.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.746
-Oh, you should talk to Lyndsey.
-Who's Lyndsey?

28:33.780 --> 28:34.847
Lyndsey Fuller,
she's a waitress.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.148
She's pretty friendly
with him.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.917
Uh, thanks.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.094
Hey,

28:48.127 --> 28:49.896
-you Lyndsey?
-Yeah.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.197
How you doing?
I'm Don Eppes, FBI.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.965
Apparently,

28:52.999 --> 28:54.033
you know Chandler Yates?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.868
Yeah. So?

28:55.902 --> 28:57.003
So, we're trying
to locate him.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.437
Why? What's he done?

28:58.470 --> 28:59.438
DON:
He was just here?

28:59.471 --> 29:02.074
A while ago.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.409
What's this all about?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.511
Some women have made
some allegations against him.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.513
Allegations against Chandler?

29:07.546 --> 29:09.081
That's ridiculous.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.250
We didn't even tell you
what they are, Lyndsey.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.085
Look, all I'm saying is
Chandler's a nice guy.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.486
So whatever these girls
are saying,

29:14.520 --> 29:16.856
there's more to it.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.090
You have any idea
where he is?

29:18.124 --> 29:19.391
No.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.860
No?

29:20.893 --> 29:23.029
Look, I got to get
back to work, okay?

29:32.004 --> 29:33.172
CHANDLER:
Oh, yeah...

29:33.205 --> 29:36.976
Shh.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.478
This is so sweet.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.313
It's 2:00 a.m.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.349
and I got a little present
just waiting for me.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.157
Wendy doesn't like me
to do certain things.

29:51.190 --> 29:57.029
But what Wendy doesn't know,
won't hurt her.

29:57.063 --> 30:01.033
And this is Chandler's
girlfriend from the beach house?

30:01.067 --> 30:03.335
Yeah. Seems like he's done this

30:03.369 --> 30:05.004
to about a dozen
different women.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.540
None of these DVDs have
any of our victims on them.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.542
I think this is
something different.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.911
Really? What do you mean?

30:11.944 --> 30:13.379
I don't think he killed
any of these girls.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.915
In fact, I don't think they know
anything happened to them.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.217
What makes you think that?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.285
I think the killing started

30:19.318 --> 30:21.253
with our first victim--
Lisa Clark.

30:21.287 --> 30:25.324
She disappeared ten days
after the mother cut him off.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.293
You think that triggered him?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.528
Well, Yates needed the money
to lure young women.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.164
Money he gets from giving
him mom sponge baths,

30:32.198 --> 30:33.399
until she pulls the plug.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.067
And that drives him to kill.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.102
But without
Mom's money,

30:36.135 --> 30:38.204
his access to the women
is gone.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.338
Right, so
in other words,

30:39.371 --> 30:40.172
Mom cut it off.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.115
( knocking )

30:52.518 --> 30:54.220
Dr. Fleinhardt.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.056
How goes it with
Don's storm-chasing?

30:57.089 --> 30:58.057
I was right.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.659
There was a change
in Carla Daniel's routine.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.895
A snowboarding injury.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.133
What, are you examining
parabolic arcs

31:07.166 --> 31:08.600
and classic projectile
motion?

31:08.634 --> 31:11.070
Actually...

31:11.103 --> 31:14.273
just practicing for the
Physics Department food fight.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.575
You know, in any event, Charles,
I've rarely known

31:16.608 --> 31:18.911
your instincts to be wrong
about such matters.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.146
Yeah, well...

31:20.179 --> 31:23.582
figuring out other people's
problems doesn't seem difficult.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.651
Are you referring
to your dream?

31:25.684 --> 31:27.519
Math isn't working.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.621
And without it,
you're lost.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.291
Have you ever stopped
to ask yourself

31:32.324 --> 31:35.294
how do you feel
about your dream?

31:35.327 --> 31:37.296
Mathematics aside.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.630
Besides math?

31:38.664 --> 31:42.168
Um... I guess,
in the moment

31:42.201 --> 31:44.370
that my dad was shot,

31:44.403 --> 31:45.604
all I remember feeling

31:45.637 --> 31:48.007
is alone.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.708
What about with your mother?

31:49.741 --> 31:53.712
It's funny, I kept wondering
why she made pancakes.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.315
I thought you mentioned
she always used to make them.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.383
Yeah, except I never
liked pancakes.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.318
You never told her?

31:59.351 --> 32:00.552
Don liked them.

32:00.586 --> 32:04.556
I just kept pretending
to like them, too.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.461
You know, numbers may be
abstract, Charles,

32:09.495 --> 32:11.463
but nevertheless,
they are

32:11.497 --> 32:14.700
objective descriptions
of the world around us.

32:14.733 --> 32:20.439
But dreams... dreams can only
be discernable to the dreamer.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.680
Hey. So, the bartender said
he was just there.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.616
Yeah, the girlfriend
tipped him off.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.318
So, we freeze his bank accounts
and credit cards.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.420
-I mean, how far can he get?
-You know, we do that,

32:34.453 --> 32:36.322
and we're gonna paint this guy
into a corner.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.556
How do you mean?

32:37.589 --> 32:40.426
If we're not careful, we can
turn him into a spree killer.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.128
A spree killer?

32:42.161 --> 32:44.130
Yeah, a serial killer hopes to
get away with it.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.097
A spree killer doesn't care.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.066
All right, look, where's
the guy go for help?

32:47.099 --> 32:48.300
His mother.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.669
Okay, so you two go see her; you
get a warrant on her phone.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.538
I'm gonna keep an eye on the
bar; maybe he'll show up there.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.073
Right? And we'll talk later.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.110
I told you, we are
not speaking.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.212
You do understand that your
son's little killing spree

33:00.246 --> 33:01.513
is gonna cost you, right?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.449
What are you talking about?

33:03.482 --> 33:08.154
His victims, Mrs. Yates,
and their bereaved families.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.189
They're all going to want to
hold someone accountable.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.392
For whatever Chandler has done,
I'm obviously very sorry.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.095
But how is it any
of my responsibility?

33:16.128 --> 33:17.363
MEGAN:
It's not yet.

33:17.396 --> 33:21.233
But we know he called you, and
if another woman is harmed...

33:24.503 --> 33:27.506
He's not going to ruin me.
Not like his father did.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.142
Man never worked a day
in his life, either.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.046
He needs money.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.447
And how are you gonna
get it to him?

33:35.481 --> 33:37.049
He knows you're
looking for him.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.450
How?

33:42.421 --> 33:47.126
I'm supposed to meet him in the
park in a little while.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.161
I'm supposed to come alone.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.562
David, you all set?

34:23.595 --> 34:26.165
He comes this way, l got him.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.700
Colby?

34:28.734 --> 34:31.270
Yeah, I'm all set.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.409
All right, he's 20 minutes late.

34:37.443 --> 34:40.379
Wait, hold on a second. I see
somebody walking towards her.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.254
I got him.
David, you see him?

34:48.287 --> 34:49.755
Yeah, I got him.

34:51.790 --> 34:55.861
Okay, he's talking to Mom.
He's trying to get the money.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.873
Three-six-nine-five
to Control.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.342
WOMAN:
Three-six-nine-five, go.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.378
Yeah, patch me through to my
team, would you?

35:12.411 --> 35:15.113
Three-six-nine-five, stand by.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.619
Three-six-nine-five, your team

35:20.652 --> 35:23.589
is in active pursuit
and is unable to respond.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.890
All right. Copy that.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.693
Look, show me
a 355 Parker Street.

35:27.726 --> 35:31.497
Roger that?

35:31.530 --> 35:34.633
I'm showing that as the
residence of Lyndsey Fuller.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.402
Copy that.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.850
-DAVID: He just took the money.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.253
-All right,
let him exit the park.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.787
Get him away from
all the people.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.260
I'm on him.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.911
He's moving
towards the parking lot.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.582
He's headed for the Lexus.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.217
Okay, all positions move in.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.185
Grab him before
he gets to the car.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.361
Yates! FBI! Stop!

36:37.863 --> 36:40.599
Yates! Stop right there,
or I will shoot.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.702
( tires squealing )

36:43.735 --> 36:46.372
DAVID:
Back out of the car,

36:46.405 --> 36:48.640
and turn around very slowly.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.744
Put your hands
in the air.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.564
Three-six-nine-five to Control.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.367
WOMAN:
Three-six-nine-five, go.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.903
Request back-up.
Assault in progress.

37:17.936 --> 37:21.773
I want my team and LAPD rolling,
Code 3. ASAP now.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.491
Shh!

37:40.759 --> 37:42.761
Shh, I'm with the FBI.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.797
He's here.

37:45.831 --> 37:46.832
He's in the house.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.034
Yates!
Yates!

37:49.067 --> 37:50.702
Yates!

37:55.574 --> 37:56.642
Yates!

38:01.580 --> 38:03.715
Yates, this is the FBI here.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.331
( door opening )

38:26.004 --> 38:27.606
Yates!

38:37.416 --> 38:39.785
( grunting and groaning )

38:39.818 --> 38:41.820
( pained yell )

38:56.468 --> 38:59.004
( distant sirens blaring )

38:59.037 --> 39:00.772
Agent... down...

39:00.806 --> 39:02.941
( distorted ):
We need a medic.

39:02.974 --> 39:06.578
( dispatcher speaking
indistinctly over radio )

39:18.023 --> 39:20.392
I used to come out here
to think.

39:20.426 --> 39:23.862
I can see you do the same thing.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.598
The house gets cluttered.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.834
Dad says there's no room.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.436
( chuckles ):
Your father's one to talk.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.837
He used to fill that dining room

39:31.870 --> 39:34.139
with his blueprints.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.642
You are a lot like him,
you know that?

39:36.675 --> 39:39.878
Am I?

39:39.911 --> 39:42.981
You were both so certain
about yourselves,

39:43.014 --> 39:47.653
about what you expected
from your lives.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.788
But not you and Don.

39:51.790 --> 39:55.761
Your brother and I were just
never as sure about ourselves.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.965
I know what I want to ask you.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.802
What is it, Charlie?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.142
Do you regret it?

40:11.176 --> 40:14.880
Regret what, sweetie?

40:14.913 --> 40:17.616
Having to take care of me.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.086
Spending those
years at Princeton,

40:21.119 --> 40:23.188
away from Dad...

40:23.221 --> 40:25.824
away from Don...

40:25.857 --> 40:27.659
Your father and I tried to give

40:27.693 --> 40:29.695
you and your brother
what you both needed.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.863
At the time,
you needed your mother.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.099
How could I regret that choice?

40:34.132 --> 40:37.102
But Don needed you, too.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.606
Don is a wonderful man, Charlie.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.874
Whatever mistakes
I've made,

40:42.908 --> 40:45.811
he's grown stronger for them.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.787
And he's done it with your help.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.659
I miss you.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.811
Hey.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.212
I didn't even
know you were here.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.214
Yeah, guess I dozed off
back there.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.850
Boy, you got
the good life, huh?

41:24.883 --> 41:26.217
What are you up to?

41:26.251 --> 41:27.953
Oh, it's just my statement.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.821
You're gonna be
okay, though, right?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.859
Yeah. What's up?

41:33.892 --> 41:36.027
I, uh...

41:36.061 --> 41:40.866
I don't want you to think
that... that you're alone.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.934
What?

41:42.968 --> 41:45.236
Seems like you've always been
left to take care of yourself.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.974
Oh, Charlie...

41:49.007 --> 41:50.876
Maybe that's why you are
the way you are.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.711
Yeah, how's that?

41:52.744 --> 41:55.781
Never allowed to be afraid.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.149
Look, believe me, I get afraid
all the time.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.919
You never show it.

42:00.952 --> 42:04.856
Well, doesn't mean
it doesn't exist, you know?

42:04.890 --> 42:07.158
I mean, I got a lot of
people counting on me.

42:07.192 --> 42:11.997
I just want you to know this is
your home, here with me and Dad.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.666
What? You don't think I come
around enough?

42:14.700 --> 42:16.267
What's going on?

42:16.301 --> 42:18.937
What are you boys doing?

42:18.970 --> 42:21.940
Uh, it's just my statement
for the shooting.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.810
Oh. Shooting, huh?

42:24.843 --> 42:28.113
Is there a... is there
a problem about it?

42:28.146 --> 42:30.348
I did shoot a man.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.983
Yeah, because
you had no choice.

42:32.017 --> 42:35.787
You always have a choice.

42:35.821 --> 42:36.955
Well, then, the trick is
to learn

42:36.988 --> 42:38.690
how to live
with the ones you make.

42:38.724 --> 42:42.027
That would be the trick.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.262
Want me to take a look?

42:44.295 --> 42:48.299
Your old man still has a few
good ideas left. Charlie...

42:48.333 --> 42:50.235
You know, I... you
know, I can...

42:50.268 --> 42:52.738
I can compute
bullet trajectories

42:52.771 --> 42:54.205
based on the layout
of the house.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.007
All right.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.944
-Where's the ballistics report?
-Over here.

42:58.977 --> 43:02.047
* "I'll give you shelter
from the storm" *

43:02.080 --> 43:05.250
Okay, let's see
what you got here...

43:10.155 --> 43:14.259
* And if I pass this way again,
you can rest assured *

43:14.292 --> 43:18.997
* I'll always do my best for
her, on that I give my word *

43:19.030 --> 43:20.832
* In a world
of steel-eyed death *

43:20.866 --> 43:23.134
* And men who are fighting
to be warm *

43:23.168 --> 43:24.703
* "Come in," she said

43:24.736 --> 43:28.173
* "I'll give you shelter
from the storm"... *
