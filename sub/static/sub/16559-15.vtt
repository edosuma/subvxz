WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.120
It's me.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.120
I've done
awful things to her.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.330
Like...?

00:18.330 --> 00:20.960
Wes.
Leave.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.540
Lahey here.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.710
Gibbins walked out on us.
You know anything about that?

00:35.710 --> 00:37.420
Why would I?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.710
I don't know where he is.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.880
This goes against
my better judgment.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.580
Then trust mine.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.580
The cops are gonna come here.
Don't answer the door.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.210
Come on.

01:15.210 --> 01:16.710
This is Annalise Keating.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.750
Leave a message.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.920
Annalise. It's Wes.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.210
I just got to the house.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.960
Please, come home.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.040
His name is Connor Walsh.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.830
The D.A. brought him
to the station yesterday.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.210
No offender with that name
in our system.
No, he's not an offender.

01:43.210 --> 01:46.380
He's been kidnapped, and he's
being held against his will!

01:46.380 --> 01:48.080
Have you been ingesting
illegal substances?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.500
My client here is
understandably upset

01:49.500 --> 01:51.040
about his boyfriend
being missing.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.620
While your lack of urgency
in this matter

01:52.620 --> 01:54.170
could be construed
as insensitive at best

01:54.170 --> 01:56.040
but homophobic at worst,
we'll ignore that

01:56.040 --> 01:58.710
if you at least let us file
a missing-persons report.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.880
When did you say
he went missing?
Last night around 7:00 p.m.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.290
Seriously?
Not even a full 24 hours?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.750
No, but --
You sure he's not just trying
to get away from the two of you?

02:06.750 --> 02:09.960
Because I can relate.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.750
You need an appointment to meet
with the District Attorney.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.580
I know, but Mr. Denver is in
his office right there, correct?

02:14.580 --> 02:16.380
D.A. Denver -- You don't get
to know where he is.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.670
Well, what if I told you
that I had

02:17.670 --> 02:20.120
super-juicy information
about a case he's working on?

02:20.120 --> 02:22.210
Carl, I need security
up here.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.710
No, no, Janice, Janice,
no, no, hang up the phone.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.830
Yeah, another entitled
law student.

02:25.830 --> 02:27.580
Hey!

02:33.750 --> 02:35.960
There he is.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.750
Hey, hey, hey!
There he is!

02:53.460 --> 02:56.420
You know "pissing contest"
is just a metaphor, right?

02:56.420 --> 02:58.460
Just tell me
where you're holding him.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.330
Who are you talking about?

03:00.330 --> 03:02.120
Connor Walsh.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.670
What? You lost him?

03:03.670 --> 03:05.670
You lost him
after he discovered

03:05.670 --> 03:07.960
the burner phone you used
to frame my client.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.920
That's a good story.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.460
Be careful who catches you
in here.

03:20.670 --> 03:21.920
You find him?

03:21.920 --> 03:24.380
Denver, yes, not Connor.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.580
What'd he say?

03:25.580 --> 03:28.750
He's playing dumb,
but he's scared.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.960
Are you almost there?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.580
I'll call you after.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.120
Canada's only
a few hours away.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.920
You want to make
a run for it?

03:47.880 --> 03:50.210
I've been running
for 10 years.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
Ms. Keating?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.420
-Yes.
-Right this way.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.330
Annalise.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.670
We could pull the fire
alarm at the police station,

04:39.670 --> 04:41.580
find Connor that way.
-Oh, so you can get arrested

04:41.580 --> 04:43.620
for real this time?
-He probably already signed

04:43.620 --> 04:45.250
an immunity deal.
-How many times do I have

04:45.250 --> 04:46.830
to tell you he would never do
anything like that?

04:46.830 --> 04:48.620
Until you finally get
that you're wrong!

04:48.620 --> 04:50.380
I need you guys
to sit down.
What is that supposed
to mean?

04:50.380 --> 04:52.170
I'm sorry.
I raided your fridge.
Think about
the amount of times

04:52.170 --> 04:53.790
that he's lied to you --
when he cheated on you,

04:53.790 --> 04:55.620
when he chopped up
Sam's body into little pieces.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.420
Okay, can we please
just be nice to each other?
You guys.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.880
He's been kidnapped,
Laurel!

04:59.880 --> 05:01.540
Maybe you coped fine
in that situation,

05:01.540 --> 05:03.290
but Connor didn't grow up
in a drug cartel.

05:03.290 --> 05:05.290
He's not properly prepared
to be a hostage.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.710
You guys.
My dad owns
a telecommunications company,

05:07.710 --> 05:09.330
so way to go
with the stereotypes.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.960
I need you all to shut up
so I can tell you something!

05:11.960 --> 05:13.750
What? Is it --
Is it about Connor?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.960
No.
It's Annalise.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.880
Something happen to her?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.210
She's meeting
with Sylvia Mahoney.

05:24.170 --> 05:26.710
Would you like to start with
a cocktail or a glass of wine?

05:30.170 --> 05:32.420
Sparkling water is fine.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.120
Feel free.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.670
The same for me.
Thank you, Clara.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.420
So...
you called me.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.170
I don't know what you think
I've done to you.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.460
I just know
I want it to stop.

05:52.460 --> 05:55.880
So I'm here to say let's
just put the horrors behind us,

05:55.880 --> 05:59.330
move on, keep the people
we love safe.

05:59.330 --> 06:02.080
A truce?

06:02.080 --> 06:04.750
You don't think
that's a bit naive?

06:04.750 --> 06:06.580
Practical is
what I think it is.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.620
It's delusional.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.830
In what world
do I not get answers

06:10.830 --> 06:12.210
for what you've done
to my family?

06:12.210 --> 06:13.920
-What I've done?
-Do you want me to sit here

06:13.920 --> 06:15.830
in the middle of this restaurant
and list them off?

06:15.830 --> 06:17.080
I lived through the terror

06:17.080 --> 06:19.290
you and your husband
enacted on me once already.

06:19.290 --> 06:20.670
I'm not here
to do it again.

06:20.670 --> 06:25.170
-That we enacted on you?
-You took my son from me.

06:25.170 --> 06:28.790
That was a car accident,
Annalise.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.750
Here we are.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.790
We have
several specials today

06:32.790 --> 06:34.120
if I can take
just a minute of your time.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.710
Not now, Clara.

06:40.380 --> 06:42.670
How dare you whine to me

06:42.670 --> 06:44.960
about how your life's
been ruined,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.920
what you've lost?

06:46.920 --> 06:49.330
My husband was gunned down
in the middle of the street,

06:49.330 --> 06:51.750
my own son framed.
-I had nothing to do with that.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.460
There is no peace
to be had

06:53.460 --> 06:55.580
if you keep lying
to me, Annalise.
I have no reason to lie.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.080
You have every reason
in the world.
You need to shut up
and listen!

07:07.790 --> 07:10.540
You're wrong.

07:10.540 --> 07:14.000
I swear on my son
and your husband's graves,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
it wasn't me.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.040
You offered me a deal --

07:20.040 --> 07:21.540
seven years
if I squeal on Annalise --

07:21.540 --> 07:22.750
and now I'm saying
I'll take it.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.920
And I'm saying
it's too late.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.080
Why? You got someone else
to turn on her?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.290
Yep.

07:29.290 --> 07:31.170
Because I'm a moron,

07:31.170 --> 07:33.040
and I'm going to reveal
my entire case to you.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.460
You don't know enough
about Connor Walsh.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.880
Whatever he testifies to in
court is gonna get thrown out.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.670
What's all the fuss
about Connor Walsh

07:39.670 --> 07:41.500
with you people, huh?

07:41.500 --> 07:45.080
Goodbye, Frank.

07:51.330 --> 07:52.670
You hungry?

07:57.500 --> 08:00.120
Bacon, egg,
and cheese.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.170
So, I turn on Annalise,
and I get a sandwich?

08:03.170 --> 08:07.170
You get...
blanket immunity

08:07.170 --> 08:09.080
and a sandwich.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.920
But if you're not ready
to do that...

08:15.460 --> 08:18.920
I'm gay, so not eating
for 48 hours

08:18.920 --> 08:21.040
is only gonna up
my shirtless-selfie game.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.920
You're right.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.830
We only have 48 hours
to hold you

08:25.830 --> 08:28.380
from the time
your intake paperwork is filed.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.000
If it's filed.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.420
This is so illegal.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.040
So is killing
your professor's husband.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.500
I'll give you
some time to think.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.830
I don't know
how you expect me

08:43.830 --> 08:45.290
to believe
anything you say.

08:45.290 --> 08:48.620
Then the both of us are
just wasting our time.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.920
That boy, who stood next
to Wallace when he was shot

08:51.920 --> 08:54.790
then pointed the finger
at my son, worked for you.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.580
"That boy" --
Is that what you call him?

08:56.580 --> 08:58.960
Well, I'd say that's
nice considering what
he did to my family.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.540
Well, what about
what you did to him?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.580
And don't deny it.
You ran a DNA test.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.290
I didn't need that test
to tell me who he was.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.960
Your husband took
what he thought he deserved,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.120
raped that woman,
and a life came of it,

09:08.120 --> 09:10.460
a black boy that he
and you could never love.
What?

09:10.460 --> 09:12.210
But he's dead now,
and that was you.
No.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.670
You got rid
of your family's shame

09:13.670 --> 09:15.460
because that's
what your family does.
You're wrong!

09:15.460 --> 09:18.170
It makes car accidents happen.
It burns down houses...
You're confused!

09:18.170 --> 09:21.120
...and pays off D.A.s to put me
in jail, whatever it takes --
Christophe wasn't
Wallace's son.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.920
He was Charles'.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
He was my grandson.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.380
I'm really looking forward
to this.
Me too.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.290
And thank you.
Oh.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.290
Rose!

09:44.380 --> 09:46.040
Is this your boy?

09:46.040 --> 09:49.620
My babysitter didn't show.
I don't usually bring him.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.120
Oh, you're not in any trouble.
Don't worry.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.080
What's your name?

09:55.080 --> 09:56.920
Christophe.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.670
Nice to meet you, Christophe.
This is my son, Charles.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.920
Hi.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.000
Hey.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.380
Okay, ti chou, let them
get to their party.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.080
Nice to see you.
-You too.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.170
Do you see now
how wrong you've been?

10:24.170 --> 10:26.420
He was my flesh and blood.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.210
Charles is
your flesh and blood, too,

10:31.210 --> 10:33.960
and Wes was the one person
who could send him to jail.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.920
I had nothing to do
with what happened to him.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.040
You had everything
to do with it.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.960
You left him
to grow up alone and poor

10:39.960 --> 10:43.000
all while supporting
your son, the rapist.
That's not what happened.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.170
How are you
still defending him?
I'm his mother.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.880
That's my job.
No, it's your job
to raise a good son.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.420
Oh, how would you know?

10:49.420 --> 10:51.120
I'm the only real mother
at this table.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.380
I was a mother.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.540
He just came
out of my body dead.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.290
Okay, that's enough.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.290
I held him against me.

11:00.290 --> 11:03.000
I felt his skin go cold
in my hands.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.250
You took everything away
from me -- his life and mine.

11:10.460 --> 11:15.170
You are wrong
about so much.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.420
-She's lying!
-I don't think so.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.250
-Why?
-It's just a feeling.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.290
A feeling is a weird way
to evaluate the situation.

11:37.290 --> 11:40.170
Can I say something?
You think Denver
did this alone?
I didn't say that.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.120
-Then who is he working with?
-I don't know. We'll find out.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.790
Excuse me! Please.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.250
We all want to find out
who killed Wes,

11:46.250 --> 11:49.670
but shouldn't Connor be
the more pressing issue here?
Oh, my God.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.880
Oliver, I told you --
Nate's on it.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.540
Okay, but if he doesn't
find him, I have another idea.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.080
Uh, kiddie porn.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.330
I read that the Russians put it
on their enemies' computers.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.330
So maybe we could
just do that to Denver.

12:04.330 --> 12:05.920
Say we'll expose
his predilection --

12:05.920 --> 12:08.790
that we planted --
if he doesn't release Connor.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.580
That means we'd have to
get kiddie porn.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.290
-No.
-Okay, then, how are we gonna

12:15.290 --> 12:17.170
get Connor back?
-I'm doing everything I can.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.330
I don't know that!

12:19.330 --> 12:21.080
Or I don't know
if I believe that.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.710
Because the way
you all talk about him,

12:23.710 --> 12:25.960
it's like you think
he's some horrible person.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.500
But I know him,
and I love him,

12:28.500 --> 12:33.170
and I don't think it's okay that
we're just sitting around here

12:33.170 --> 12:36.000
waiting for him to get hurt.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.330
Do you want one?

12:46.380 --> 12:48.330
What happened?
-You don't shove stinky food

12:48.330 --> 12:49.710
in a pregnant lady's face.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.830
I thought they only got sick
in the morning.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.750
They get sick all the time.
And why are you always eating?

12:53.750 --> 12:55.460
-I'm stressed.
-Yeah, join the club.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.330
Okay, you all need to leave.

12:57.330 --> 12:58.620
-What about Connor?
-We don't have a plan.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.960
Because I'm eating
your food?

12:59.960 --> 13:01.750
This is my house, so I get
to decide when you leave.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.290
We'll call you as soon
as we know anything.

13:06.290 --> 13:07.420
I promise.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.500
You have it, or are we going
to keep playing games?

13:23.500 --> 13:24.920
Games are a hell
of a lot more fun

13:24.920 --> 13:27.540
than whatever it is
we're doing.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.880
Just give it to me.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.920
Get out.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.460
Lovely seeing you, too.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.170
What's that?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.210
Wes Gibbins' phone.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.000
You had it
this whole time?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.420
Or we found it in your car when
we brought you into custody,

14:03.420 --> 14:05.080
proving that you killed Wes.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.960
Why are you doing this?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.120
Do the Mahoneys have
something on you?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.420
Or are they paying you?
Do you --

14:10.420 --> 14:12.170
Do you have lame
political aspirations

14:12.170 --> 14:13.670
and they're funding
your campaign?

14:13.670 --> 14:17.170
'Cause this is corrupt
and illegal and stupid.

14:17.170 --> 14:21.580
Sign the deal, or we arrest you
by the end of the night.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.500
Are they right?

14:43.080 --> 14:45.210
Did Sylvia play me?

14:51.580 --> 14:53.290
I take that as a yes.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.790
If she cared so much
about her grandson,

15:01.790 --> 15:05.620
then why was it you
who protected him and not her?

15:05.620 --> 15:07.830
And she's hurt people
before --

15:07.830 --> 15:10.750
you, the baby.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.210
That was Wallace.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.040
Are you sure?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.500
Where are you going?

15:23.500 --> 15:26.330
To get drunk.

15:26.330 --> 15:30.580

As you know, this year has been
the most awful of my life.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.670
And thinking about
what Laurel's going through

18:07.670 --> 18:09.710

18:09.710 --> 18:12.830

we should tell each other things

19:39.670 --> 19:40.920
I said I don't know.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.710

how does anyone know?

19:43.710 --> 19:45.880

with Aiden?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.120

19:48.120 --> 19:49.380
that he was my Barack.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.540
Don't judge me.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.040
I'm not.

19:59.210 --> 20:02.290
I had a bad childhood.

20:02.290 --> 20:06.540
I never learned the proper way

20:06.540 --> 20:08.380
It's not my fault.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.580

21:54.580 --> 21:56.120
Where's Connor Walsh?

to Annalise --

21:59.210 --> 22:00.670
Well, I just don't get it.

22:00.670 --> 22:04.290
Your M.E., Atwood,
whatever other people

22:04.290 --> 22:06.750
in this station you've got
doing dirty work for you,

22:06.750 --> 22:09.040
there's gonna be a trail.
-Is it the sex?

22:09.040 --> 22:11.290
Do you get off by being used
by women above your pay grade?

22:11.290 --> 22:12.880
You're sounding like
a guilty man right now.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.290
You're her trained dog.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.120
I've been working
in your office for months,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.330
gathering what I need
to take you down.
There's nothing there.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.580
Then how come I got a file
full of evidence

22:20.580 --> 22:23.750
proving corruption, conspiracy,
civil-rights violations?

22:23.750 --> 22:25.500
I'm putting you in jail
with that bitch!

22:25.500 --> 22:27.790
And that is the only place
you're going!

22:31.960 --> 22:35.290
You're fired --
just in case that wasn't clear.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.580
- On your feet.
- What's going on?

22:39.580 --> 22:40.880
Connor Walsh,
you're under arrest

22:40.880 --> 22:42.580
for the murder
of Wes Gibbins.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.790
You have the right
to remain silent.
No, this is a set-up.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.250
Anything you say can
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.670
Wait, wait, I'll --
I'll give you what you want.
Your immunity deal is
off the table.

22:49.670 --> 22:52.080
What if I know something
that could put her away?

22:54.290 --> 22:55.670
And what is that?

22:55.670 --> 22:57.380
Philly P.D.
Open up.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.290
We have a warrant
to search the premises.
Stay where I can see you.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.330
-Oh, my God.
-What?

23:08.330 --> 23:10.620
They know there's a copy
of Annalise's phone.
How?

23:10.620 --> 23:13.460
-How do you think?
-Got it.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.580
Annalise.

23:16.580 --> 23:17.920
Annalise.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.750
What's wrong?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.750
The police found
a copy of your phone

23:24.750 --> 23:26.170
in Oliver's apartment.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.920
Connor.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.000
Oliver said
there was nothing on it.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.620
Nothing he found.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.880
Wes left a voicemail
that night.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.620
Annalise, it's Wes.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.790
I just got to the house.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.750
I was at the police station.

23:53.580 --> 23:57.120
They found Rebecca's body.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.290
They're saying you did it...

23:59.290 --> 24:01.290
all of it...

24:01.290 --> 24:03.620
even Sam.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.120
You can't go down
for what I did.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.880
There's no way I could live
with myself, so just...

24:13.250 --> 24:16.120
...please, come home.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.960
He was scared...

24:32.960 --> 24:36.580
as was I.

24:36.580 --> 24:39.080
And I didn't want the police
to hear him confessing.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.210
Or you didn't want them to hear
how it incriminated you.

24:42.210 --> 24:44.670
It incriminated
all of us.

24:44.670 --> 24:46.170
But Oli didn't find
any voicemail,

24:46.170 --> 24:47.250
which means it's gone.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.040
That's not true.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.790
Deleted messages go
into the un-allocated data fold.

24:51.790 --> 24:52.830
I might have missed it.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.500
So the police
could still find it?

24:54.500 --> 24:56.500
Now can we blame Connor?

24:56.500 --> 24:57.920
No, I'd told him
there was nothing on it.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.580
He probably thought
it was harmless.

24:59.580 --> 25:03.080
Or he took a deal.
This isn't Connor's fault.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.920
Now, I have a way to fix this,
get Connor back,

25:09.920 --> 25:12.120
but we have to give Denver
another suspect.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.830
Frank --
He already confessed.

25:14.830 --> 25:17.880
Annalise's case is tied
to Frank's.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.290
The Mahoneys --
We know that they did this.
It's not the Mahoneys.

25:29.290 --> 25:30.710
No.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.330
"No" what?

25:32.330 --> 25:34.540
It's the only way,
Laurel.

25:34.540 --> 25:35.620
Who is it?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.210
Wes.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.540
No, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.580
Honestly, Denver's
never gonna buy that.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.880
Maybe we should just go
with Oliver's kiddie-porn idea.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.170
You pretended you love him,
and now you're gonna

25:51.170 --> 25:53.670
sell him out
to save yourself.
To save us all.

25:53.670 --> 25:56.120
God, he was good.
He was the only one of us --

25:56.120 --> 25:57.750
He would want us to do this,
and you know that.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.080
Now you're turning him
into a murderer.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.670
He was a murderer.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.080
And you?

26:06.080 --> 26:08.250
I assumed it was Frank,
but maybe Rebecca was you.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.580
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.790
You need to calm down.

26:11.790 --> 26:13.080
Or maybe it was
the both of you?

26:13.080 --> 26:14.960
Maybe we all just need
to take a deep breath.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.380
How convenient --
Now Wes is gonna go down

26:16.380 --> 26:18.290
for Sam and Rebecca,
and the two of you get off.

26:18.290 --> 26:20.460
Well, you know what?
You need to grow the hell up!

26:22.170 --> 26:24.290
I'm doing this for you --
each of you --

26:24.290 --> 26:25.540
so you don't
have to go to prison

26:25.540 --> 26:27.420
and get naked
in group showers

26:27.420 --> 26:30.170
and crap in front of people
that might rape you.

26:30.170 --> 26:32.580
It's death in there.

26:32.580 --> 26:35.830
And this horrible thing
that we must do...

26:35.830 --> 26:37.120
it's life.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.040
He would want us
to do this.

26:50.330 --> 26:53.670
You never knew him.

26:53.670 --> 26:56.170
You don't know
what he would want.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.830
Are you mad at me?

27:14.830 --> 27:17.000
No. Why would I be mad
at you?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Please stop.

27:20.750 --> 27:23.540
I'm doing these
for your benefit.

27:23.540 --> 27:27.170
Maybe you'll actually love me
if I have abs.

27:27.170 --> 27:30.620
Oh, God, just...
let me explain, please.

27:37.250 --> 27:40.830
"I don't know"
is the truth.

27:40.830 --> 27:43.420
I really, really wish
I did know

27:43.420 --> 27:45.750
so that I could honestly
say it or not say it,

27:45.750 --> 27:47.500
but what
I don't think is fair is

27:47.500 --> 27:49.960
for me to say it
just because you want me to

27:49.960 --> 27:52.790
or because
you said it first.

27:52.790 --> 27:55.290
Yeah, I only want you
to say it if you mean it.

27:55.290 --> 27:56.460
Exactly.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.620
I felt better
before this conversation.

28:09.120 --> 28:12.330
I need a favor,
and you both need to say yes.

28:12.330 --> 28:14.540
That's not really a fair way
to ask for a favor.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.790
I don't think
Annalise's plan is gonna work.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.500
I think that Denver is gonna
see right through it,

28:17.500 --> 28:18.750
and Connor may be
already cracked.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.670
Either way, we go to jail,
and the one thing

28:20.670 --> 28:23.000
that I can't handle
about that is not knowing
what happened to Wes.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.500
That's not right.
It's not okay.

28:26.670 --> 28:29.250
So I just need
your support on this.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.540
What's "this"?

28:31.540 --> 28:33.120
Just say yes,
and then I'll tell you.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.710
Why hasn't
she called yet?

28:43.960 --> 28:45.580
She'll call.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.620
We're both losing right now.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.120
And we're going to keep losing
as long as we stay

28:49.120 --> 28:51.000
at each other's throats.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.620
It's just gonna get
bloodier.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.380
We could fight
to the death,

28:55.380 --> 28:57.290
or we can put
all this behind us.

28:57.290 --> 28:58.710
How?

29:00.620 --> 29:02.920
I'm gonna tell you what
you're gonna find on my phone.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.830
They found Rebecca's body.

29:06.830 --> 29:09.170
They're saying you did it...

29:09.170 --> 29:11.210
all of it...

29:11.210 --> 29:13.330
even Sam.

29:16.420 --> 29:19.000
You can't go down
for what I did.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.960
There's no way I could live
with myself, so just...

29:24.960 --> 29:27.580
please, come home.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.420
Wes killed my husband.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.790
He confessed to it on the
voicemail he left that night.

29:46.670 --> 29:49.540
And that he killed
his girlfriend, Rebecca Sutter.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.880
Help!

30:04.880 --> 30:07.960
Your detectives called him
to the station that day,

30:07.960 --> 30:10.710
confronted him
about what he'd done.

30:10.710 --> 30:13.460
He had the chance to sign
the deal and pin it all on me.

30:15.330 --> 30:16.830
Help!

30:16.830 --> 30:18.790
Please!

30:18.790 --> 30:20.380
Why didn't he?

30:20.380 --> 30:23.540
Well, because no one knew
the Wes Gibbins I did.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.290
Help!

30:25.290 --> 30:26.920
The boy who showed signs
of aggression and violence

30:26.920 --> 30:28.000
at an early age...

30:28.000 --> 30:29.620
Help!

30:29.620 --> 30:32.170
...who was suspected of stabbing
his mother, Rose Edmond...

30:32.170 --> 30:34.120
Please!

30:34.120 --> 30:35.460
...a law student
who was confined....
Help!

30:35.460 --> 30:36.920
to psychiatric care
for threatening

30:36.920 --> 30:38.710
to take his own life.

30:40.460 --> 30:45.420
But in the end,
there was always the monster.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.330
Why are you doing this?

30:58.330 --> 30:59.920
Hey.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.000
So he killed himself.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.080
Better to die
than go to jail.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.000
A suicide by fire?

31:33.000 --> 31:36.790
Well, it's your job
to sell that.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.000
All I know is I've given you
what you need

31:42.000 --> 31:43.210
to drop my charges.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.790
No.

31:50.790 --> 31:53.210
Connor Walsh found
the burner phone you used

31:53.210 --> 31:55.290
to frame me
in your possession.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.000
He'll testify
to that in court.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.250
You think
anyone will believe him?
You want me to come after you

31:59.250 --> 32:00.920
the way you came after me?
You mean kill me?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.580
You're the only killer
in this room.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.420
Oh, please.
That boy's blood is
on your hands.

32:04.420 --> 32:05.580
Maybe you didn't
do it yourself,

32:05.580 --> 32:07.880
but you're behind it,
and both of us know that.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.670
He was burned
like a piece of trash,

32:09.670 --> 32:13.210
and you deserve
to feel the same pain.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.790
But you know what?
I'm gonna let you win.

32:18.790 --> 32:21.620
So take the gift.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.330
Take it,
or I'll come for you.

32:24.330 --> 32:26.620
I'll find every cop
you've paid off,

32:26.620 --> 32:29.250
every defendant you've framed,
and I'll keep coming at you

32:29.250 --> 32:30.670
until I have
your head on a stick

32:30.670 --> 32:32.000
in front
of the courthouse.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.540
Give me my deal.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.500
Where is he?

32:44.500 --> 32:46.830
Did it --
Did it not work?

32:48.920 --> 32:51.420
Oh, my God.

32:51.420 --> 32:54.620
I was so worried about you.
-I know.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.750
I thought something awful
happened to you.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.960
It didn't. I'm --
I'm okay. I'm okay.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.670
Where is everyone?

33:10.620 --> 33:12.330
You got this.

33:25.790 --> 33:27.920
Excuse me.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.330
Would you recommend
this place for dinner?

33:29.330 --> 33:30.580
I'm from out of town,

33:30.580 --> 33:32.500
and I didn't come to New York
for terrible food.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.670
The food's okay.
Drinks are better.

33:35.670 --> 33:37.790
Mm.

33:37.790 --> 33:40.420
Buy me a drink,
and I'll see if I agree.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.710
You could at least tell me
your name.

33:42.710 --> 33:45.920
Buy me that drink,
and I'll tell you everything.

33:54.710 --> 33:56.330
I know Kate was
our scheduled speaker,

33:56.330 --> 33:57.960
but she's running
a little late.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.710
So, would anyone
like to start?

34:03.580 --> 34:06.460
I'll go.

34:06.460 --> 34:07.790
Great.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.330
My name is Annalise,
and I'm an alcoholic.

34:14.330 --> 34:16.080
Hello, Annalise.

34:19.080 --> 34:23.000
I lost someone.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.290
He was a student of mine.

34:25.290 --> 34:27.710
They found Rebecca's body.

34:27.710 --> 34:30.080
They're saying you did it...

34:30.080 --> 34:31.460
all of it...

34:31.460 --> 34:33.120
even Sam.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.710
You can't go down
for what I did.

34:34.710 --> 34:38.120
There's no way I could live
with myself so just...

34:38.120 --> 34:40.380
please, come home.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.460
Obviously, this points
to Gibbins being behind

34:42.460 --> 34:45.250
both the Sam Keating
and Rebecca Sutter murders,

34:45.250 --> 34:48.000
thereby casting doubt
on our entire case.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.960
That depends on how it's
interpreted by a jury.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.710
I no longer want
to bring

34:52.710 --> 34:54.960
Ms. Keating's case
before a jury.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.460
Excuse me?

34:56.460 --> 34:59.670
I can't in good conscience
continue to prosecute her

34:59.670 --> 35:02.170
now that Mr. Lahey has
brought me this voicemail.

35:02.170 --> 35:04.040
Since the night of the crime,
he's been adamant

35:04.040 --> 35:05.620
our office has had
the wrong suspects.

35:05.620 --> 35:08.580
I had no hard evidence
till I found the voicemail.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.790
You're going to get
destroyed in the press.

35:10.790 --> 35:13.380
The Attorney General --
I have no other choice,
Your Honor.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.460
I got this one wrong.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.750
I'm a professor.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.580
I knew him before that --

35:23.580 --> 35:27.750
since he was a boy.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.830
His mother died
and left him alone.

35:29.830 --> 35:33.580
I...tried to look after him.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.250
I just kept picturing you
in some well,

35:36.250 --> 35:37.540
putting the lotion
in the basket.

35:37.540 --> 35:39.380
-It wasn't that bad.
-I know.

35:39.380 --> 35:40.880
Just -- You're the
most important thing in my life,

35:40.880 --> 35:42.210
so whatever you want,
I'm here.

35:42.210 --> 35:43.920
We can move to California.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
We can make a million babies
if you want.
Good, let's get started, then.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.120
-Connor, I'm serious.
-I know.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.250
No, Connor,
no, I'm really serious.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.960
Marry me.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.750
I mean it.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.380
Marry me.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.790
I didn't do it because
I was trying to be some saint.

36:08.790 --> 36:12.460
I did it out of guilt.

36:12.460 --> 36:15.670
I hurt him in ways
that I couldn't even admit

36:15.670 --> 36:17.920
in this room.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.880
Look, you miss Wes.
I get that. I do.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.080
I...

36:22.080 --> 36:27.040
I miss my dad...
every day...

36:27.040 --> 36:28.420
so much,
and he was a giant ass,

36:28.420 --> 36:30.330
but...

36:30.330 --> 36:33.580
this is not
a good idea, Laurel.

36:33.580 --> 36:34.620
What's happening?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.250
I just couldn't
leave him alone.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.460
And I know why.

36:55.330 --> 37:01.500
I lost a baby
in a car accident, but...

37:01.500 --> 37:03.830
...it was much worse than that.

37:32.170 --> 37:34.580
It should've been me.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.500
I know that, so...

37:39.420 --> 37:42.830
I'll do whatever
you want.

37:42.830 --> 37:45.000
Go after the people
who did this, find them.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.750
I'm here for you.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.880
I just couldn't
keep him out of my head.

38:03.880 --> 38:08.170
I mean, I would just...

38:08.170 --> 38:09.920
worry if he did his homework

38:09.920 --> 38:12.750
or if he had any friends.

38:12.750 --> 38:16.580
And on Christmas,
it would just make me sick

38:16.580 --> 38:19.500
worrying if he even had
any presents. I --

38:21.960 --> 38:24.750
I told myself to stay away.

38:24.750 --> 38:26.500
What was broken in me
was broken.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.790
No one could fix it.

38:28.790 --> 38:30.460
And then I did the opposite.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.040
What happened?

38:34.040 --> 38:35.420
He invited me
back to his place.

38:35.420 --> 38:36.750
He's getting
a cab right now.

38:36.750 --> 38:38.330
Then go.
We'll follow you.
No, we won't!

38:38.330 --> 38:40.000
It's better.
We're gonna confront him there.
No, I can't.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.380
-This is for Wes.
-No, it's for you,

38:41.380 --> 38:42.620
and I'm sorry,
but you're not the only one

38:42.620 --> 38:44.420
who knows what love is here.

38:44.420 --> 38:45.420
I think I love you, too.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.330
-Oh, my God. Stop.
-Are you sure?

38:47.330 --> 38:49.040
Hey, the guy
who killed Wes is outside,

38:49.040 --> 38:50.880
and we have a chance
to finally confront him!

38:50.880 --> 38:52.920
No, because that would make us
insane, stupid people.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.710
How do you suddenly know?
We are not doing this
right now!

38:55.710 --> 38:57.250
Okay, I'm leaving.
Laurel! Laurel!

38:57.250 --> 38:59.000
He's a rapist
and probably a killer.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.250
I know. It's fine.
I have this.

39:01.250 --> 39:04.120
What is that?!
Are you --
Are you insane?!

39:05.790 --> 39:10.500
I took him into my life,
into my home.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.250
He needed someone
to look after him,

39:12.250 --> 39:15.120
someone to love him,
and I wanted to be that person.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.830
I wanted to protect him.

39:18.830 --> 39:22.500
I tried so hard.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.540
Stop that girl!

39:30.670 --> 39:32.750
All I did was ruin him.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.290
I mean, if I had
just left him alone,

39:34.290 --> 39:36.540
he would've been fine,
but I just --

39:36.540 --> 39:39.710
I just wanted to --
I wanted to love him.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.920
I wanted to hold him tight.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.830
I wanted to keep him safe...

39:49.080 --> 39:53.790
...this boy, my student,

39:53.790 --> 39:55.290
who was really
just a stranger to me.

39:55.290 --> 39:57.290
Laurel?

39:58.290 --> 39:59.750
Dominick?

39:59.750 --> 40:01.210
Hey. Give me a hug.

40:01.210 --> 40:03.580
- Hi.

40:07.670 --> 40:09.250
It's me.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.920
We have
a little problem.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.670
iGuapísima!

40:15.670 --> 40:17.080
"Smart" might also be
a compliment your
daughter likes to hear.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.710
You're a member
of this family,

40:18.710 --> 40:20.330
and you reap
the benefits, m'ija.

40:20.330 --> 40:23.750
Don't ever disappear
on me like that again.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.040
At least tell me
he's dead.

40:26.040 --> 40:28.620
Yeah.
But it got kind of messy.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.670
What are you doing here?
I'm in town for work.

40:35.670 --> 40:37.290
You?

40:37.290 --> 40:38.620
Laurel!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.420
Who is this?

40:44.420 --> 40:47.420
This is Dominick.
He's a -- He's a family friend.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.540
That's a lie.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.580
He wasn't just a stranger.

41:02.540 --> 41:05.250
He was, um...

41:11.790 --> 41:15.250
He felt...

41:20.710 --> 41:22.670
He -- He felt...

41:26.620 --> 41:28.920
He felt like my son.

41:39.040 --> 41:43.120
He felt like my son...

41:43.120 --> 41:44.290
because he was.

41:44.290 --> 41:46.000
He was my son.

41:49.210 --> 41:52.000
He was my son.
He was my son.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.790
And he's gone.
