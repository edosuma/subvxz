[harmonica plays]

00:08.409 --> 00:10.444
Roseanne, I have a problem.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.180
The carpet in the corner
of my living room is loose,

00:12.213 --> 00:14.048
and I need Dan to fix it.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.816
Jackie, remember
when I was 10 years old

00:15.849 --> 00:17.685
and I told you that
you could come to me

00:17.718 --> 00:20.388
anytime that you had a problem?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.423
Well, I was ten.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.292
Well, he did build the place.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.260
You know, he's supposed
to fix that stuff.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.962
What's bugging you?

00:28.996 --> 00:33.367
Look what I found in David's
room when I was cleaning today.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.703
Oh man, that looks like pot.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.109
Yep, that's pot, all right.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.281
Mary Jane, stick, weed, dope.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.152
Call it what you
like, it's trouble.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.323
You know,
sometimes, Jackie, you

00:55.356 --> 00:58.526
must strike yourself as weird.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.728
Did ya tell Dan about it yet?

01:00.761 --> 01:03.564
No, he's in such a
bad mood from work,

01:03.597 --> 01:07.301
I'm afraid of what
he would do to David.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.902
Well, you just get him
in a really good mood,

01:08.936 --> 01:10.238
and then you tell him.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.541
Jackie, I hardly have the
time to get Dan all liquored up,

01:13.574 --> 01:14.942
have sex with him,
and make s'mores.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.750
I will just wait for
the perfect moment.

01:22.783 --> 01:27.188
DAN: DJ, get off the roof, now!

01:27.221 --> 01:28.389
He bolted.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.692
[footsteps on ceiling]

01:35.696 --> 01:39.567
How many times have I told
you to stay off the roof?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.834
I wasn't on the roof!

01:43.871 --> 01:44.738
Get in your room.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.573
You're grounded.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.643
What?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.745
Dan, I was the one that told
him he could play on the roof.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.316
I figured it was
safer than the park.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.050
I get enough grief
at work, Roseanne.

01:57.084 --> 02:00.321
I don't need it
when I come home.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.989
So, you gonna tell
him about the pot?

02:02.022 --> 02:06.093
Huh, I don't know yet.

02:06.126 --> 02:10.598
Uh, Dan, um, Jackie's
carpet came untacked,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.466
and she wants you to
fix it immediately.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.204
DAN: Jackie can go to hell!

02:16.237 --> 02:18.172
No, not the right moment.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.609
[theme music]

03:00.180 --> 03:02.149
[laughs]

03:02.182 --> 03:05.586
[music playing]

03:07.187 --> 03:08.188
This is a waste of time.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.091
Getting drunk Isn't
gonna cheer me up.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.496
True, but you won't
irritate me as much.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.731
Guys at work are
really ticking me off.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.932
Can't get them to listen to me.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.968
Can't get them to
take me seriously.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.471
Oh, so they're
just like the kids.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.039
I can't afford to screw
this job up, Roseanne.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.508
I mean, it's OK to
fail when you're 25.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.143
But if you fail when you're
42, you're a serious loser.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.945
Now, that's not
really true, honey.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.315
I just told you that
when you were 25 to make

03:34.348 --> 03:36.750
you feel better.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.719
Great, the pressure's off.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.654
Ah, forget it.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.190
You owe me another beer.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's Pete doing here?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.529
He took the afternoon
off because he

03:48.562 --> 03:50.163
was supposed to be sick.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.399
Well, maybe he is.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.701
He ain't walking too steady.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.337
That guy there is
my biggest headache.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.237
He comes in late.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.506
He does lousy work.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.907
Twice last week he
had somebody else

03:59.940 --> 04:02.242
punch his time card for him.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.577
You hate him, Dan?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.878
I hate him.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.946
You want to kill him, Dan?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.348
I want to kill him.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.849
You go kill him.

04:08.882 --> 04:09.717
Bring me back some pretzels.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.657
Feeling better?

04:16.690 --> 04:17.891
Oh, Dan.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.927
Hey, uh, I didn't
expect to see you.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.928
I bet you didn't.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.430
Um, Dan, do you
know my wife, Marissa.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.331
No, hey.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.099
Hello.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.835
What'd the doctor say?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.037
Oh, he, uh, said I
should stay off my feet

04:30.070 --> 04:33.607
and drink plenty of fluids.

04:33.641 --> 04:37.378
Look, Pete, I don't like
it when my people lie to me.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.514
Your people?
What are you, Moses?

04:40.548 --> 04:41.415
No, come on.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.916
I'm serious, Pete.
- I'm sorry.

04:42.950 --> 04:43.584
I'm sorry.
You're right.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.852
I'm busted.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.919
Let me make it up to ya.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.389
Let me buy you and
your wife a beer, huh?

04:48.422 --> 04:53.394
All right, uh, I don't want
to see you hung over tomorrow.

04:53.427 --> 04:57.898
Don't worry, if I'm
hung over I won't come in.

04:57.931 --> 04:58.899
He'll be on time.

04:58.932 --> 04:59.733
He won't get drunk.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.740
So, what the hell was that?

05:06.774 --> 05:07.908
You went over there
to yell at him.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.109
You didn't do a damn thing.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.812
And where's my pretzels?

05:11.845 --> 05:14.014
Well, he's buying us a beer.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.248
I'm handling it.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.784
No, you're not.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.619
You're just going to
bottle all your anger up

05:18.652 --> 05:20.120
and then you're gonna
take it home, and take

05:20.153 --> 05:21.689
it out on somebody there.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.023
I got my anger out.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.224
I told him I was upset.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.659
He won't do it again.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.027
Yeah, he will.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.930
Pretty soon his lunch breaks
are going to start being longer.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.100
And then his diseases
will be more exotic.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.870
Then his relatives will
start dropping like flies.

05:36.904 --> 05:37.771
You're wrong.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.672
I can handle him.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.708
I know him, Roseanne.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.877
I am him, Dan.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.179
Now, you gotta
start getting tough.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.548
You are gonna have
to start cracking

05:47.581 --> 05:50.050
down on all these people
that give you a hard time.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.819
Fine, you're fired!

05:51.852 --> 05:54.287
Wish you would have told
me this 20 years ago.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.558
[music playing]

05:59.092 --> 06:00.060
DAN: Just drop it, Roseanne.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.895
You're really
starting to annoy me.

06:01.929 --> 06:02.996
Starting?

06:03.030 --> 06:05.666
What, have you been
ignoring me all night?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.435
Look, you don't
understand, Roseanne.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.871
When I came into this job, I had
30 guys under me who were all

06:10.904 --> 06:12.606
mad they weren't made foreman.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.075
Now, I can't fix every
truck in the city by myself.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.444
So I gotta get these
guys to like me,

06:16.477 --> 06:17.678
so they'll work for me.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
That isn't how it works, Dan.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.248
People don't work for you
because they like you.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.117
They work for you
because they fear you.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.553
That's the way
you work, Roseanne.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.421
That's not the way I work.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.190
Every boss I've ever had has
been a total hard-ass jerk,

06:30.223 --> 06:31.825
and I always swore I
wouldn't be that way.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.128
Now, if I become one of those
guys, I'll be a hypocrite.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.864
Well look, I'm gonna deal
with this thing my way.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.298
If you don't like
it, that's tough.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.767
Dan, don't freak out.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.135
David's not the first kid
to bring pot in the house.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.781
What?

06:53.814 --> 06:58.285
Jackie, this is going to
be your shortest visit ever!

06:58.318 --> 07:00.454
Well, you people argue
so much, I get so confused.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.628
David was smoking
pot in the house?

07:07.661 --> 07:12.866
What is this new obsession
with David all about?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.334
David!

07:14.367 --> 07:18.005
I want to talk with you
in the kitchen, now!

07:18.038 --> 07:19.072
You want to see me get tough?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.140
No, Dan.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.510
Not when you're so
damn upset about Pete.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.777
That isn't fair to David.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.912
I will handle it, OK?

07:24.945 --> 07:28.616
David should be killed
for the right reasons.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.485
Don't forget, now, it
can lead to other drugs.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.686
And theft.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.755
And why do you think
they call it dope.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.093
Something wrong?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.862
David, sit down.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.669
David, do you smoke pot?

07:48.702 --> 07:49.570
Me?

07:49.603 --> 07:50.571
No, of course not.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.404
I would never.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.474
Twice.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.316
Well, I found this
in your room today.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.151
Is that yours?

08:08.221 --> 08:10.190
Yes.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.860
Well, David, I guess I
really don't need to tell you

08:12.893 --> 08:14.862
that drugs can ruin your life.

08:14.895 --> 08:18.431
Leaving you a physical,
emotional, and spiritual wreck.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.900
And I don't suppose
that I have to tell

08:19.933 --> 08:22.670
you that you can receive up
to five years in prison--

08:22.703 --> 08:25.973
according to the latest
federal sentencing guidelines.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.742
And I know, because I read
that in Outlaw Biker magazine.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.848
But I can tell you that there is
a 12-year-old boy living here.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.484
And if you ever bring drugs
in my house again, you're out.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.386
You got it?

08:39.419 --> 08:41.088
Think so.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.790
Do you have
anything to add, Dan?

08:42.823 --> 08:45.926
You know, you really should
get down on your knees, David,

08:45.959 --> 08:49.863
and thank us because a lot of
people would not be this cool.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.032
I know.

08:52.065 --> 08:52.866
Well?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.445
Thank you for being so cool.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.852
See how low drugs
have made you sink?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.394
This is your brain.

09:24.197 --> 09:24.998
Dan, a pan.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.504
And this, is your
brain on drugs.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.179
Got it.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.914
Go to your room,
David, while Mr. Conner

09:40.948 --> 09:43.016
and I decide your punishment.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.593
You really showed
me, Roseanne.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.528
Well, I hope you
took notes, Dan.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.563
Yup, you were tough.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.898
You were firm.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.533
And now that David fears you,
he'll never do that again.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.637
And he respects me, Dan.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.073
Only one thing wrong.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.141
This is your pot, Roseanne.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.044
[guitar plays]

10:11.078 --> 10:13.046
What do you mean
that's my pot?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.448
See how low drugs
have made you sink?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.293
Well, Dan, I think
I would remember

10:26.326 --> 10:28.061
hiding pot in the house.

10:28.095 --> 10:31.832
Not if you were
stoned at the time.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.533
I hid it.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.835
Well, that's just great, Dan.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.870
A very fine example you're
setting for the kids.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.271
Stealing their mothers stash.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.142
Honey, I didn't steal it.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.778
I put it away 20 years
ago when we quit.

10:44.812 --> 10:45.679
We quit?

10:45.713 --> 10:46.780
I just thought we were out.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.486
Don't you remember?

10:53.520 --> 10:57.024
You were pregnant with Becky and
you told me to get rid of it.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.792
Then why the hell didn't you?

10:58.826 --> 11:01.194
I tried to flush it.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.464
But as I watched it
float helplessly,

11:04.497 --> 11:06.734
I thought to myself, am I
really ready for this part

11:06.767 --> 11:08.635
of my life to be over with?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.403
Next thing you know, I was
down on my hands and knees

11:10.437 --> 11:12.205
with an aquarium net
and your hair dryer.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.710
Oh god, Dan.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.945
I feel terrible.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.914
I blamed David for
pot that was mine.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.515
Well, he said it was his.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.585
So he probably has some, and
now he's gonna get rid of it.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.954
I mean, we may be on
to something here.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.288
You could yell at him
for something else

11:28.321 --> 11:31.691
and see what he confesses to.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.127
Have you guys decided
on my punishment yet?

11:34.161 --> 11:34.962
Not yet, young man.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.399
I hope you realize
that you have put us

11:39.432 --> 11:41.101
into a very awkward position.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.405
I'm really sorry.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.707
Not half as sorry
as I am, mister.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.447
Felt good to apologize.

DAVID (ON PHONE): Hey, Darlene.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.123
David?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.024
Where are you?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.592
I can barely hear you.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.726
I'm at a phone booth.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.864
The guy who lives here
is letting me use it.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.866
Well, why don't you
just call from home?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.935
I was just wondering if
you might have left something

12:14.968 --> 12:16.003
behind in your bedroom.

12:16.036 --> 12:21.408
Your socks, your
hairbrush, your marijuana?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.442
What are you talking about?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.643
I don't smoke pot.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.477
Dulls my hatred.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.283
I know you've
tried it, Darlene.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.885
Well, I've tried
sex with you, too.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.122
Doesn't mean I'm addicted.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.057
Well, if the pot's
not yours and it's

12:37.090 --> 12:40.093
not mine, then whose is it?

12:40.127 --> 12:43.030
All right, Becky.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.431
DAVID (ON PHONE): Becky?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.833
So then I'm off the hook.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.068
I'll just tell your mom that I
just took the blame because I

12:48.101 --> 12:49.369
thought the pot was yours.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.839
And she'll say, well, if
you thought it was Darlene's

12:51.872 --> 12:53.941
that must mean she smokes pot.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.443
Well, no, not
necessarily, Mrs. Conner.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.511
Oh, so she just sells it?

12:58.545 --> 12:59.980
No, of course not.
But--

13:00.013 --> 13:01.781
But nothing.
Darlene is dead.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.784
When I see her, she's gonna
need drugs to kill the pain.

13:04.818 --> 13:08.255
OK, OK, it's mine.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.957

Feeling nostalgic?

No, I just hauled up the rest
of my stuff from the basement.

13:30.643 --> 13:35.548
I wanted to make sure there
was nothing incriminating left.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.617
I thought you threw
this stuff out years ago.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.485
No, that was your stuff.

Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

be such a long, bad day.

about this David thing?

Yeah, well, make
room for Daddy.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.406
Today I was a real man.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.108
I took the bull by the horns.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.110
I fired Pete.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.677
What did you do that for?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.746
Because you told me to.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.816
Well, Dan, you should always
check with me before you do

14:09.849 --> 14:12.119
anything that I told you to do.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.154
I did the right thing.

I handled it exactly correctly.

Man, I feel terrible.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.594
When did it happen, Roseanne?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.364
When did we go from
doing stuff, to yelling

14:24.397 --> 14:26.499
at people for doing stuff?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.334
When did we get old?

14:30.203 --> 14:35.308
Well, for me, I
guess it was, uh,

14:35.342 --> 14:38.111
the first time I ever
discussed the corns on my feet

14:38.145 --> 14:38.946

sleep here tonight?

No, he's rude.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.056
And I don't like his parents.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.491
Well, then can I
sleep over there?

I'll roll it.
