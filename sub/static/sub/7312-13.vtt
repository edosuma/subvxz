00:03.434 --> 00:05.739
[camera shutter clicks]You are one hot dog-walker.

00:05.782 --> 00:07.347
Do that again,
and I'll kill you.

00:07.391 --> 00:08.826
You love it and you know it.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.826
Seriously, it shows up
on Facebook, we're done.

00:10.869 --> 00:12.565
Ooh,

00:12.608 --> 00:14.130
so serious.

00:14.173 --> 00:16.826
[dogs barking]

00:16.869 --> 00:19.217
See, even they're annoyed.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.478
Yeah, well,
your dog-walking job's

00:21.521 --> 00:22.695
cutting into
my breakfast time.

00:22.739 --> 00:24.000
Oh, yeah, well,
hold on one second.

00:24.043 --> 00:25.130
I just need to get Odie first.

00:25.173 --> 00:27.173
[dog barking]

00:27.217 --> 00:28.826
Odie?

00:28.869 --> 00:30.608
Hey. Hold this.

00:30.652 --> 00:32.652
Stay.

00:32.695 --> 00:33.652
Hey, boy.

00:33.695 --> 00:34.826
How'd you get out?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.043
Kyle, look.

00:37.086 --> 00:38.565
That's blood.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.217
Maybe he's hurt.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.434
Hey, you okay?

00:42.478 --> 00:44.043
What happened?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.304
[barking]

00:45.347 --> 00:46.173
Come on,
let's follow him.

00:47.956 --> 00:49.391
Odie?
Where is
he going?

00:49.434 --> 00:50.391
Come here, boy.[barking]

00:53.086 --> 00:54.217
[barking]

00:56.086 --> 00:57.434
Odie, what is it?

00:57.478 --> 00:58.652
[whimpers]

00:58.695 --> 01:00.130
Kyle, what's he doing?

01:00.173 --> 01:02.347
I don't know.

01:05.043 --> 01:07.304
[whining]

01:09.304 --> 01:11.521
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wooten?

01:46.086 --> 01:48.260
[elevator bell dings]It's rude, Tony.

01:48.304 --> 01:50.391
I called you
four times.

01:50.434 --> 01:52.043
Well, there's two things
wrong with that statement.

01:52.086 --> 01:53.521
One, we're not dating,

01:53.565 --> 01:55.478
and two, you know I don't
take calls from anyone,

01:55.521 --> 01:57.260
especially you,
after 7:00 p.m.

01:57.304 --> 02:00.086
You forget I have a life.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.652
What's your point?
My point,
McGee-Party-of-One, is that

02:02.695 --> 02:04.434
you were leaving me
messages, evidently,

02:04.478 --> 02:05.739
about some kind
of case file.

02:05.782 --> 02:07.869
Yeah, one in which I
needed you to sign.

02:07.913 --> 02:10.347
Which you could have waited
until this morning for.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.521
Give it to me.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.521
See that?

02:12.565 --> 02:14.347
Now all I have to do is sign it.

02:14.391 --> 02:15.608
Look at that.

02:15.652 --> 02:18.304
Signing John Hancock--
just kidding--

02:18.347 --> 02:22.043
Anthony DiNozzo.

02:22.086 --> 02:23.652
I do not like
seeing you two fight.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.304
It's not my fault
he's sensitive today.

02:28.434 --> 02:29.956
Hmm.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.173
"Mariposa Luxuries."

02:32.217 --> 02:34.347
I didn't order
anything.

02:34.391 --> 02:36.652
Maybe somebody else did.

02:36.695 --> 02:38.260
Timmy's got a
secret admirer?

02:38.304 --> 02:39.434
Hmm.

02:50.434 --> 02:51.608
Um...

02:53.608 --> 02:55.956
It's real funny, Tony.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.391
[laughing]:
You think I did this?

02:58.434 --> 02:59.565
I would not put it past you.

02:59.608 --> 03:01.434
Guys, come on,

03:01.478 --> 03:02.956
a little credit, please.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.304
I have grown past this
kind of sophomoric thing.

03:06.347 --> 03:11.173
I mean, who would do
something so... genius?

03:11.217 --> 03:12.434
McGee with a plastic girlfriend.

03:12.478 --> 03:14.043
Congratulations, Tim.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.913
She's very sweet.The receipt's got

03:15.956 --> 03:17.521
my credit card
information on it.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.217
There must be some mistake.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.913
I would cancel your credit card.

03:20.956 --> 03:22.782
Right now all I need to do is
figure out how to

03:22.826 --> 03:24.217
deflate this thing.Oh, that's easy.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.260
There's always a
button right here

03:25.304 --> 03:26.478
on the back
of the neck.

03:27.739 --> 03:29.608
There's no reason
I should know that.

03:31.434 --> 03:32.913
Morning, boss.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.782
This isn't
what it looks like, boss.

03:40.173 --> 03:42.130
Then what is it, Tim?

03:42.173 --> 03:44.869
Um, a joke, I think,

03:44.913 --> 03:45.956
a really bad

03:46.000 --> 03:47.304
practical joke.

03:47.347 --> 03:48.347
I'm not laughing.

03:49.826 --> 03:50.869
Lose your gal pal.

03:52.260 --> 03:53.304
Grab your gear.

03:53.347 --> 03:55.826
Got a dead marine
in Springfield.

03:57.217 --> 03:58.956
This is really awkward.

04:00.521 --> 04:03.000
[plastic squeaking,
McGee grunts]

04:05.304 --> 04:07.739
All right.

04:07.782 --> 04:10.652
TONY:
We're looking at Marine
Sergeant Travis Wooten,

04:10.695 --> 04:12.739
35 years old,
active reservist.

04:12.782 --> 04:13.782
Family?

04:13.826 --> 04:16.000
Married with a six-year-old son.

04:16.043 --> 04:18.695
Wife's a marine-- Gunnery
Sergeant Georgia Wooten.

04:18.739 --> 04:20.434
She's 32.

04:20.478 --> 04:22.391
Boss, according
to the dog-walker,

04:22.434 --> 04:25.913
our victim was home with his
wife and child last night.

04:25.956 --> 04:27.565
She spoke to the wife
just before 11:00 p.m.

04:27.608 --> 04:28.869
to confirm picking up the dog.

04:28.913 --> 04:29.869
Does she know
where they are now?

04:29.913 --> 04:31.043
Nope.

04:31.086 --> 04:32.695
Greetings, everyone.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.608
Oh, isn't this a terrible sight?

04:34.652 --> 04:36.000
GIBBS:
Victim's a marine
sergeant, Duck.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.913
Pity about
the evergreen.

04:37.956 --> 04:40.652
I doubt that it will survive
such a drubbing.

04:40.695 --> 04:43.608
I guess I'm not the only one
who kills plants. Yeah,

04:43.652 --> 04:45.347
back in college, my friends used
to call me Black Thumb.

04:45.391 --> 04:47.173
They still do,
actually,

04:47.217 --> 04:49.130
but now it's 'cause I...
I work with dead people.

04:51.739 --> 04:53.956
So not important.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.130
Ah...

04:55.173 --> 04:57.217
There is definite evidence of

04:57.260 --> 04:58.478
blunt force trauma.

04:58.521 --> 05:00.043
Some kind of heavy object

05:00.086 --> 05:01.652
to the back and sides
of the skull.

05:05.391 --> 05:07.043
You got time of death?Uh...

05:07.086 --> 05:09.347
around 1:00 a.m.

05:09.391 --> 05:11.260
He went with a struggle.

05:12.086 --> 05:13.347
There are wounds

05:13.391 --> 05:15.217
on the back and front
of his hands.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.217
Oh. Here's something, Doctor.

05:18.869 --> 05:21.304
Looks like part of a twig.DUCKY: Yeah.

05:23.652 --> 05:24.608
That could be...

05:24.652 --> 05:26.217
any of several species

05:26.260 --> 05:27.434
in this garden.

05:27.478 --> 05:28.956
[sighs]
Gibbs, I found

05:29.000 --> 05:30.478
three plates of food
still on the table,

05:30.521 --> 05:32.000
and a bathtub full of water.

05:32.043 --> 05:33.652
Wife and child left in a hurry.

05:33.695 --> 05:34.652
Or they were forced to leave.

05:36.173 --> 05:37.130
I also found blood.

05:37.173 --> 05:38.391
Where?

05:38.434 --> 05:39.956
In the master bedroom.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.565
Put out a BOLO.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.826
He might not be our only victim.

05:50.043 --> 05:53.043
Boss, police are canvassing the
National Capitol region, but...

05:53.086 --> 05:54.347
so far nothing.

05:54.391 --> 05:56.130
The family contacted?Nobody's seen them.

05:56.173 --> 05:58.173
I also talked to

05:58.217 --> 05:59.347
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's C.O.

05:59.391 --> 06:01.391
He stated she did
not request leave

06:01.434 --> 06:02.739
or liberty.
GIBBS:
Background?

06:02.782 --> 06:05.391
Well, I guess true love's
not dead after all.

06:05.434 --> 06:07.217
Travis and Georgia Wooten,

06:07.260 --> 06:08.347
they were high school
sweethearts.

06:08.391 --> 06:09.652
They joined the
Marines in 2000

06:09.695 --> 06:11.000
and got married
two years later.

06:11.043 --> 06:12.826
ZIVA:
Sergeant Wooten served
in Afghanistan,

06:12.869 --> 06:15.739
stationed at Camp Leatherneck
in Helmand Province.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.043
Disciplinary action?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.043
Nothing-- his service
was without incident.

06:19.086 --> 06:20.043
In more ways than one.

06:20.086 --> 06:21.956
The C.O.s called him

06:22.000 --> 06:24.130
"proficient yet unremarkable."

06:24.173 --> 06:26.913
Maybe that's why he stayed a
sergeant and she's a gunny.

06:26.956 --> 06:28.956
Well, apparently, the gunny's
a real shooting star.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.521
Georgia Wooten...

06:30.565 --> 06:32.652
She was promoted
to gunnery sergeant

06:32.695 --> 06:34.173
after only eight years.

06:34.217 --> 06:36.913
Qualified for the Marine
Enlisted Commissioning Program.

06:36.956 --> 06:39.000
Did several tours
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

06:39.043 --> 06:41.739
Awarded both the Navy
and Marine Corps Commendation

06:41.782 --> 06:44.347
and Achievement Medals
for exemplary service.

06:44.391 --> 06:45.521
TONY:
That's enough to make

06:45.565 --> 06:47.956
any man feel like...
less than a man.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.043
Marriage problems?

06:49.086 --> 06:50.608
Not that we know of.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.260
But the sergeant may have had
some problems of his own.

06:52.304 --> 06:53.565
We're still running, uh,

06:53.608 --> 06:54.695
credits cards,
cell phones, e-mails,

06:54.739 --> 06:56.043
but we do know
he recently lost his job

06:56.086 --> 06:57.782
at a Virginia auto parts plant,

06:57.826 --> 07:00.260
and been boozing it up at, uh,
Feeney's Billiards ever since.

07:00.304 --> 07:01.695
McGee's got the bank records.

07:01.739 --> 07:04.173
Found multiple charges.

07:04.217 --> 07:05.391
One as recently as last night.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.608
That's an hour before his death.

07:10.043 --> 07:12.130
I'll look for the owner.

07:12.173 --> 07:15.043
[sighs]
I love the smell of fresh
felt in the morning.

07:15.086 --> 07:18.913
Do not know what that means,
and I do not think I want to.

07:18.956 --> 07:21.652
Uh, it's a little Duvall-
Apocalypse Nowreference,

07:21.695 --> 07:23.869
but, never mind,
I'm talking about pool tables.

07:23.913 --> 07:25.478
Traditionally, they're green.

07:25.521 --> 07:27.347
For some reason,
these are red.

07:27.391 --> 07:30.043
I did not know you were
a pool dolphin, Tony?

07:30.086 --> 07:31.043
Pool shark.

07:31.086 --> 07:32.217
And yes, I was.

07:32.260 --> 07:33.304
In fact,
I was the champion

07:33.347 --> 07:34.478
of my Baltimore
precinct

07:34.521 --> 07:37.173
in the late '90s.
"Late '90s"?

07:37.217 --> 07:40.217
[laughs]
That makes you...

07:40.260 --> 07:42.652
sound so...
What, old?

07:42.695 --> 07:43.652
Don't say old.

07:43.695 --> 07:45.608
I didn't say it. You did.

07:47.043 --> 07:49.913
Well, I bet Renaissance Ray

07:49.956 --> 07:52.869
wouldn't even know his way
around a pool table.

07:52.913 --> 07:54.826
You know, Tony, you do not
wear jealousy very well.

07:54.869 --> 07:56.608
Makes your face look all pinchy.

07:56.652 --> 07:58.869
Pinched.MAN [laughs]:
Oh, I know

07:58.913 --> 08:00.695
a bickering couple
when I hear one.

08:00.739 --> 08:02.739
Len Feeney,
owner and operator.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.739
NCIS Special Agent
Tony DiNozzo.

08:05.782 --> 08:06.913
This is Probationary Agent

08:06.956 --> 08:08.130
Ziva David.

08:08.173 --> 08:09.913
And we are not...

08:09.956 --> 08:11.043
a couple.

08:11.086 --> 08:12.956
Could've fooled me.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.695
We need to ask you
some questions.

08:14.739 --> 08:15.956
Oh, sure.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.086
Here.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.826
It's regarding
one of your, um...

08:18.869 --> 08:20.260
customers...

08:20.304 --> 08:22.478
Sergeant
Travis Wooten.

08:22.521 --> 08:24.304
Sure, I know Travis.
One of my regulars.

08:24.347 --> 08:26.000
Is everything all right?

08:26.043 --> 08:27.695
Not exactly. He's dead.

08:28.869 --> 08:30.130
Oh.

08:30.173 --> 08:32.086
Well, I just saw him last night.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.565
Did anything happen
out of the ordinary?

08:34.608 --> 08:36.043
Well, he came in
at his usual time,

08:36.086 --> 08:37.347
sat in his
usual spot...

08:37.391 --> 08:40.043
Practically his second home,
huh?

08:40.086 --> 08:41.565
Well, it is for a lot
of service people.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.217
That's the way
I want it.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.478
Place to feel
comfortable.

08:46.347 --> 08:48.304
I, uh, served

08:48.347 --> 08:49.695
in the first Iraq War.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.434
I know the challenges

08:51.478 --> 08:53.434
our men and women face
when they come home,

08:53.478 --> 08:54.956
and Travis was
no different.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.260
Challenges were getting to him?

08:56.304 --> 08:57.652
Well, he never let it show.

08:57.695 --> 08:59.521
He was always laughing,
cracking jokes ...

08:59.565 --> 09:00.565
had a lot of friends
around here.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.173
Did any of
these friends

09:02.217 --> 09:04.043
have issues
with Sergeant Wooten?

09:04.086 --> 09:07.347
No, Travis' only issue
was his lady.

09:07.391 --> 09:10.043
His lady?
You mean his wife?

09:10.086 --> 09:11.869
Well, as far as I know,
he was divorced.

09:11.913 --> 09:13.043
He had a girlfriend, though.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.173
She was a real
piece of work.

09:15.217 --> 09:16.434
Loved to make a scene.

09:16.478 --> 09:17.826
Always yelling at him.

09:17.869 --> 09:19.652
And she was here last night.

09:19.695 --> 09:21.347
Clung to him like a wet rag.

09:21.391 --> 09:22.956
Yeah. "Wet rag" have a name?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.695
Oh, yeah, Jancey Gilroy.

09:32.304 --> 09:35.043
Yeah, me and Travis
were at the club together.

09:35.086 --> 09:36.347
Until what time?

09:36.391 --> 09:39.000
I don't know;
about 12:30 or so.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.434
Then I went home
and went to bed.

09:41.478 --> 09:42.478
You have anyone
that can verify that?

09:42.521 --> 09:43.782
I don't understand.

09:43.826 --> 09:46.304
He kissed me good night,
and told me he loved me.

09:46.347 --> 09:48.260
Said he'd see me later.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.000
He was fine.
Everything was fine.

09:50.043 --> 09:51.217
Not according to
the club owner.

09:51.260 --> 09:53.304
Said you were
volatile together.

09:55.478 --> 09:57.695
So what?

09:57.739 --> 09:59.043
You think I had something
to do with this?

10:00.217 --> 10:01.869
I loved Travis.

10:01.913 --> 10:03.217
We were going to get married.

10:03.260 --> 10:05.173
Except he already was.

10:07.347 --> 10:09.086
No, you're-you're wrong.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.043
He got a divorce.

10:11.086 --> 10:12.086
I helped him through it.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.043
This is Georgia Wooten,

10:15.086 --> 10:16.652
and their six-year-old
son, Jacob.

10:16.695 --> 10:19.086
They may be in danger now, too.

10:19.130 --> 10:22.043
I don't know anything
about them.

10:22.086 --> 10:24.695
I don't know anything
about any of this.

10:26.086 --> 10:28.043
Looks painful.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.869
Yeah, well, you try
cutting nails all day long

10:29.913 --> 10:30.739
and see what happens.

10:34.086 --> 10:35.173
To think

10:35.217 --> 10:37.695
William Penn was a pacifist.

10:37.739 --> 10:39.043
I believe the
victim's name

10:39.086 --> 10:40.434
was Travis Wooten, Doctor.

10:40.478 --> 10:41.739
Not him;

10:41.782 --> 10:42.782
those.

10:42.826 --> 10:44.521
Gladwynensis Berberis,

10:44.565 --> 10:46.826
otherwise known as
William Penn barberry.

10:46.869 --> 10:49.217
Penn, of course,
was also a devout Quaker.

10:49.260 --> 10:50.782
Penn as in Pennsylvania Penn?

10:50.826 --> 10:52.565
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Penn

10:52.608 --> 10:54.130
settled that great land...

10:54.173 --> 10:56.043
founded a government,

10:56.086 --> 10:58.173
and some of his statutes
later became the basis

10:58.217 --> 10:59.913
of the American Constitution.

10:59.956 --> 11:03.652
"I wrote the Constitution, and
all I got was this lousy plant."

11:03.695 --> 11:04.913
[chuckling]

11:04.956 --> 11:07.130
This lousy plant,

11:07.173 --> 11:09.956
as you call it,
sometimes emits a natural oil

11:10.000 --> 11:11.956
that wipes away
everything around it.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.478
Lucky break
for the killer.

11:13.521 --> 11:14.869
Not so lucky for us.

11:14.913 --> 11:17.347
Ah, Jethro, this,

11:17.391 --> 11:19.391
by the way,
may take some time.

11:19.434 --> 11:21.608
What I've found so
far is troubling.

11:21.652 --> 11:24.304
I counted 11 blows
to the head,

11:24.347 --> 11:26.304
many more to the back and chest.

11:26.347 --> 11:28.217
Vicious attack.And determined.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.869
I mean, with that many,

11:29.913 --> 11:32.739
the attack must have taken
several minutes.

11:32.782 --> 11:34.782
Enough for him to land
a few punches himself, Duck?

11:34.826 --> 11:37.347
And get a hand on the weapon.
Mr. Palmer?

11:37.391 --> 11:40.260
The wood taken
from Sergeant Wooten's palm

11:40.304 --> 11:42.347
was snapped at
a downward angle.

11:42.391 --> 11:44.739
In a struggle, a splinter
this size could have

11:44.782 --> 11:46.043
broken off as the
weapon was yanked away.

11:46.086 --> 11:47.217
Did you get prints?

11:47.260 --> 11:48.434
Not yet.

11:48.478 --> 11:50.869
There is another unique marking.

11:50.913 --> 11:52.869
[sighs]

11:57.043 --> 11:58.956
Maybe from a second weapon?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.391
Possibly. It's a
peculiar design.

12:01.434 --> 12:03.652
Abby is working on it.

12:03.695 --> 12:06.478
And then, there are these.

12:08.695 --> 12:09.869
That from the fight?

12:09.913 --> 12:11.608
No. The wounds
are partially scabbed,

12:11.652 --> 12:13.739
and the color
of the bruises tells me

12:13.782 --> 12:15.869
that they're days,
if not weeks, old.

12:15.913 --> 12:18.000
You know, Jethro, the
nature of this attack

12:18.043 --> 12:19.521
suggests someone
who's not afraid

12:19.565 --> 12:21.304
to get close to their victim,

12:21.347 --> 12:23.521
and will stop at nothing
to finish him off.

12:23.565 --> 12:26.173
Someone he knew.

12:26.217 --> 12:28.869
Intimately.

12:28.913 --> 12:32.000
TONY:
State police found
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

12:32.043 --> 12:33.478
and her son
near the Maryland border.

12:33.521 --> 12:34.391
They're bringing them in now.

12:34.434 --> 12:36.652
McGee, contact
Family Services.

12:36.695 --> 12:38.521
Request a grief

12:38.565 --> 12:40.000
[elevator bell dings]

12:40.043 --> 12:42.043
TONY:
You might want
to call them back.

12:42.086 --> 12:43.217
Now.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.608
Hey, sweetie, I need to talk
to these people for a moment,

12:47.652 --> 12:49.608
so I'm gonna leave you
with these two guys, and I'll be

12:49.652 --> 12:51.347
right back, okay? Okay.
Okay.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.478
[sighs]

12:57.913 --> 13:00.391
You must be Agent Gibbs?

13:00.434 --> 13:02.521
Gunny Wooten.

13:02.565 --> 13:05.391
We've got a counselor
standing by if you need one.

13:05.434 --> 13:07.391
I don't need a counselor.

13:07.434 --> 13:08.956
I need to see my husband.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.260
I'm asking you
to take me to him.

13:13.304 --> 13:14.521
I want to see him
for myself.

13:26.086 --> 13:28.173
One heck of a grieving widow.

13:28.217 --> 13:30.739
McGEE:
I'll call Ducky.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.652
[elevator bell dings]

13:47.260 --> 13:49.130
Remove the sheet.

13:51.217 --> 13:52.652
Please?

14:12.173 --> 14:13.565
Take him.

14:15.782 --> 14:17.739
Gunny?

14:17.782 --> 14:20.043
I can't pay for a funeral
right now.

14:34.521 --> 14:36.043
Is this going to take long?

14:36.086 --> 14:38.521
I need to get back to my son.

14:39.521 --> 14:41.130
He's in good hands.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.086
I'd rather stand. Thank you.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.391
[sighs]

14:47.434 --> 14:49.130
You had a lot of people worried.

14:49.173 --> 14:50.608
I promised Jacob

14:50.652 --> 14:53.565
we'd go to Kingsland Fun Park
for his birthday.

14:53.608 --> 14:55.391
Mm. What time did you leave?

14:55.434 --> 14:56.782
Just before 11:00.

14:56.826 --> 14:59.521
Fun park open that late?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.869
We wanted to be first in line.

15:01.913 --> 15:03.869
Ah.

15:03.913 --> 15:05.217
Get a hotel room?

15:05.260 --> 15:06.521
Yes.

15:06.565 --> 15:08.043
You tell anybody?

15:08.086 --> 15:10.217
I told my husband.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.130
Told my C.O.

15:12.173 --> 15:14.478
Your C.O. says you didn't
request leave or liberty.

15:14.521 --> 15:16.000
He's wrong.

15:17.478 --> 15:18.782
I thought you brought me in here

15:18.826 --> 15:20.000
to ask questions
about my husband.

15:20.043 --> 15:21.086
Yeah, I did.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.000
Then fire away, Agent Gibbs.

15:30.608 --> 15:33.173
Sergeant Wooten
have any enemies?

15:33.217 --> 15:35.043
Besides the ones we're fighting
over in Afghanistan?

15:35.086 --> 15:36.956
No.

15:39.434 --> 15:41.347
How about Jancey Gilroy?

15:42.521 --> 15:44.478
His girlfriend?

15:45.913 --> 15:47.869
Travis told me that was over.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.521
Yeah, well,
he didn't tell her that.

15:51.695 --> 15:54.217
You having
marriage problems?

15:56.391 --> 15:58.434
Well, Travis, uh, lost his job,

15:58.478 --> 16:00.608
so... money was tight.

16:00.652 --> 16:02.217
We were... working through it.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.565
We were...

16:07.173 --> 16:09.000
I can't believe he's gone.

16:11.391 --> 16:13.217
I can't believe
I get to raise my son alone.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.695
"Get to"?

16:14.739 --> 16:16.565
Hmm?

16:16.608 --> 16:18.304
You "get to"?

16:19.913 --> 16:22.391
My mind's a little scrambled
right now.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.130
You look pretty
steady to me.

16:26.173 --> 16:28.565
I'm a United States Marine,
Agent Gibbs.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.304
Steady is how I'm built.

16:30.347 --> 16:33.217
Steady is what
my son needs right now.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.521
Steady...

16:34.565 --> 16:36.043
is all I've got.

16:36.086 --> 16:37.434
You're a marine.

16:37.478 --> 16:38.695
You should
understand that.

16:42.086 --> 16:43.913
Come on, baby.

16:53.086 --> 16:54.565

17:11.043 --> 17:12.739
Since when did banks
become so evil?

Since about the 12th century.

they can do.

17:17.173 --> 17:18.391
What happened?

17:18.434 --> 17:19.652
Well, somebody
has accessed

17:19.695 --> 17:21.782
my accounts, my credit cards;

17:21.826 --> 17:23.391
they even have
my social security number.

17:23.434 --> 17:24.739
And they have been
racking up payments

Hi, Gibbs!

17:59.826 --> 18:01.695
I've a lot to tell you.
Well, n-not a lot, but

18:01.739 --> 18:03.434
enough, for now.
Um, meet Steve,

18:03.478 --> 18:05.652
and Bill, and... Rupert;

18:05.695 --> 18:06.739
at least, that's what
I like to call them.

18:06.782 --> 18:08.739
They're replicas of
Sergeant Wooten;

18:08.782 --> 18:10.086
specifically, his head.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.652
You know, I thought it
might be kind of creepy

18:11.695 --> 18:13.304
to name a fake
head after a real

18:13.347 --> 18:15.391
dead guy, and I thought
this would be more respectful.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.565
Abbs, what's the point?

18:16.608 --> 18:17.913
Okay.

18:17.956 --> 18:19.652
I re-created each blow

18:19.695 --> 18:21.391
using three different weapons,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.565
all made from a material
similar in composition

18:23.608 --> 18:25.652
to the wood that was found
in Sergeant Wooten's hand,

18:25.695 --> 18:26.956
and all heavy enough

18:27.000 --> 18:28.652
to inflict
the same sort of damage.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.130
My goal was to see which one

18:30.173 --> 18:31.826
best matched up
with the head wounds.

18:31.869 --> 18:32.869
And?
And...

18:32.913 --> 18:34.434
it's none of them.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.000
Look...

18:36.043 --> 18:38.304
By measuring the
depressions in the skull,

18:38.347 --> 18:39.826
I deduced that the one
that came the closest

18:39.869 --> 18:41.043
was the broom handle.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.217
But here's the kicker:

18:42.260 --> 18:44.173
it's not close enough.

18:44.217 --> 18:46.695
The markings
aren't as deep.

18:46.739 --> 18:48.130
Which makes me think
that the weapon

18:48.173 --> 18:49.304
is-is smaller,

18:49.347 --> 18:52.304
so... voilÃ !

18:52.347 --> 18:53.478
It's a perfect match.

18:53.521 --> 18:54.956
I know.
So here...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.304
is the weapon of choice.

[computer keys clicking]

19:00.086 --> 19:01.173

very close to it.

covered in some sort of stain

19:05.173 --> 19:07.086
or varnish, or something;
and it's very rare.

19:07.130 --> 19:08.304
I haven't been able
to find a single

19:08.347 --> 19:10.000
U.S. manufacturer.
I'm still looking.

19:10.043 --> 19:11.434
What about
the neck wound?

19:11.478 --> 19:13.000
Oh...

19:13.043 --> 19:14.434
I'm not sure about
that yet, either.

19:14.478 --> 19:18.260
My best guess is
some sort of metal chain.

19:18.304 --> 19:20.173
I can't believe
the amount of force used.

19:20.217 --> 19:21.826
Our killer had
a lot of rage, Abb.

19:24.608 --> 19:27.043
Gibbs, we confirmed
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

19:27.086 --> 19:29.347
did, in fact,
lie about requesting leave.

19:29.391 --> 19:30.739
C.O. filed
the U.A. paperwork today.

19:30.782 --> 19:32.652
McGee, e-mails?Well, nothing unusual

19:32.695 --> 19:34.739
in her Navy correspondence.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.913
Still tracking down all her
personal e-mail accounts.

19:36.956 --> 19:39.695
But... I do have this.

19:39.739 --> 19:41.478
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

19:41.521 --> 19:43.782
has led dozens of

19:43.826 --> 19:47.000
Marine Corps Martial Arts
training programs in Quantico.

19:47.043 --> 19:48.826
TONY:
Somebody needs a safe word.

19:48.869 --> 19:50.434
When was this shot?

19:50.478 --> 19:51.913
Two months ago.

19:51.956 --> 19:54.043
After she got back from
her last tour in Afghanistan.

19:54.086 --> 19:55.217
A lot of anger there.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.869
She's a strong, powerful woman,

19:56.913 --> 19:58.565
in a world dominated by men.

19:58.608 --> 19:59.956
That's not anger:

20:00.000 --> 20:01.782
that is determination.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.391
McGee, zoom in.

20:05.565 --> 20:07.434
McGEE:
Looks like she got banged up.

20:07.478 --> 20:09.869
Poor little rookie
never had a chance.

20:09.913 --> 20:12.000
Find out why.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.695
MAN:
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

20:15.739 --> 20:17.913
became overly aggressive
with a candidate.

20:17.956 --> 20:19.869
Her conduct
was noted and addressed.

20:19.913 --> 20:21.782
That's where
the bruises came from?

20:21.826 --> 20:24.043
They were consistent
with the incident on that day

20:24.086 --> 20:25.434
and prior
training sessions, yes.

20:25.478 --> 20:26.782
She get overly aggressive
a lot?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.347
No. First time.

20:28.391 --> 20:30.260
Having any problems
with this particular candidate?

20:30.304 --> 20:31.565
Not to my knowledge.

20:31.608 --> 20:33.130
Think the issue went
deeper than that.

20:33.173 --> 20:35.043
How deep?

20:35.086 --> 20:36.956
Gunnery
Sergeant Wooten

20:37.000 --> 20:38.043
is an exceptional
marine.

20:38.086 --> 20:40.304
Served as my liaison

20:40.347 --> 20:42.043
with Afghan women
and children.

20:42.086 --> 20:43.608
Has great focus
and skill.

20:43.652 --> 20:45.652
But after her last tour
of Afghanistan,

20:45.695 --> 20:48.086
that focus has been lacking.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.956
Signs of post-traumatic
stress?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.521
Marines are debriefed
upon returning from duty.

20:52.565 --> 20:55.217
Physical and psychological
evaluations

20:55.260 --> 20:57.043
are available to those
who need counseling.

20:57.086 --> 20:59.130
McGEE:
The gunnery sergeant
need counseling?

20:59.173 --> 21:01.391
Her debriefing showed no need.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.086
You believed that?

21:03.130 --> 21:06.173
I agreed with
the evaluations.

21:07.826 --> 21:09.130
Well, I'm not asking

21:09.173 --> 21:10.826
for your professional
opinion, Major.

21:15.217 --> 21:17.826
Georgia's an incredible woman...

21:17.869 --> 21:21.043
great marine and loving mother.

21:21.086 --> 21:24.043
But lately, something's
got her all torn up inside,

21:24.086 --> 21:25.869
and it has nothing to do
with her work here.

21:29.869 --> 21:32.826
ZIVA:
These were taken
of Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

21:32.869 --> 21:35.130
by an emergency room doctor

21:35.173 --> 21:38.304
to document what he called
"suspected domestic abuse."

21:38.347 --> 21:39.956
Any other E.R. visits?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.086
ZIVA:
Five in six years.

21:41.130 --> 21:43.695
All different
hospitals.

21:43.739 --> 21:45.130
Were the police contacted?

21:45.173 --> 21:46.652
She refused to
press charges.

21:46.695 --> 21:48.304
GIBBS:
Was her C.O. notified?

21:48.347 --> 21:51.826
Marine counselors questioned
her, but she insisted

21:51.869 --> 21:53.086
that her injuries
were the result

21:53.130 --> 21:57.043
of boxing training
at an off-base gym.

21:57.086 --> 21:59.173
She refused the military's help.

21:59.217 --> 22:00.565
Yes.

22:02.043 --> 22:04.217
The only reason
she'd lie about that

22:04.260 --> 22:06.043
is because Georgia Wooten
was an abused woman.

22:06.086 --> 22:08.043
And the guy
who was abusing her

22:08.086 --> 22:09.652
turns out to be
our murder victim?

22:22.956 --> 22:25.000
These bruises
and lacerations

22:25.043 --> 22:26.217
could be consistent

22:26.260 --> 22:29.478
with somebody hitting
a target repeatedly.

22:29.521 --> 22:30.695
Target was the wife, Duck.

22:32.913 --> 22:34.826
I wouldn't blame her
if she did this.

22:34.869 --> 22:36.434
Nobody would,

22:36.478 --> 22:38.565
but that doesn't make
it any less of a crime.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.391
She never reported it.

22:40.434 --> 22:42.347
Well, I'm not
surprised.

22:42.391 --> 22:46.086
The last thing a woman like
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten wants

22:46.130 --> 22:47.826
is to be seen as a victim.

22:47.869 --> 22:49.695
No, she's too proud.
Too weak

22:49.739 --> 22:51.391
is more like it.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.086
She's a classic case of
emotional transference--

22:54.130 --> 22:56.869
strong and powerful
on the job

22:56.913 --> 22:58.869
because she is completely
without power at home.

22:58.913 --> 23:01.304
She was a prisoner.

23:01.347 --> 23:05.652
And perhaps killing her husband
is her one chance at freedom.

23:07.826 --> 23:10.130
I got to get her
to open up.

23:10.173 --> 23:11.956
Yeah, I agree,
but I'm not sure

23:12.000 --> 23:13.347
that you're the
one for the job.

23:15.434 --> 23:17.391
Agent David has
been through things

23:17.434 --> 23:19.739
that you and I
can't even imagine,

23:19.782 --> 23:22.260
and she knows what it's like
to be controlled.

23:22.304 --> 23:26.000
I'm not sure I want
to open up those wounds, Duck.

23:26.043 --> 23:30.086
Yes, but she may be the only
one who can connect with her.

23:30.130 --> 23:33.000
GEORGIA: I told Agent Gibbs all I know.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.608
You did not tell him everything.

23:34.652 --> 23:36.304
I know what happened
to you.

23:36.347 --> 23:37.565
You have no right,

23:37.608 --> 23:38.739
none at all.

23:38.782 --> 23:40.608
I did not come here
to challenge you.

23:40.652 --> 23:41.695
And you think this
is helping me?

23:41.739 --> 23:42.913
Look, I'm not
the enemy.

23:42.956 --> 23:44.434
I only want to find out
the truth.

23:44.478 --> 23:45.565
Truth according to who-- you?

23:45.608 --> 23:48.086
JACOB:
Mom,

23:48.130 --> 23:49.130
I'm hungry.

23:49.173 --> 23:50.782
Okay, baby, I'll
be in in a second

23:50.826 --> 23:51.652
and we'll fix
you something.

23:54.086 --> 23:56.086
You need to leave now.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.000
Wait.

24:00.521 --> 24:03.000
I know what it's like to be
under the control of a man,

24:03.043 --> 24:06.391
to feel like
you have no power

24:06.434 --> 24:10.043
and the only way to get
that power back is to shut down.

24:10.086 --> 24:13.521
You tell yourself
you must shut down.

24:13.565 --> 24:15.043
You tell yourself

24:15.086 --> 24:17.739
to never show
any emotion to anybody.

24:17.782 --> 24:20.000
I know what that's like.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.521
It's the only way
you can survive.

24:25.913 --> 24:29.130
I also know what it's like to...
want to seek revenge.

24:32.782 --> 24:36.086
I did not kill my husband,
Agent David.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.782
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my son.

24:41.173 --> 24:42.913
ZIVA:
There is no getting
through to her.

24:42.956 --> 24:44.347
She's closed off.

24:44.391 --> 24:46.086
Even with family and friends,
apparently.

24:46.130 --> 24:47.478
I spoke to several of them,

24:47.521 --> 24:49.695
and they had no idea
the abuse was going on.

24:51.086 --> 24:52.956
Blood from the
bedroom matches

24:53.000 --> 24:54.086
Gunnery Sergeant
Wooten's, boss.

24:56.869 --> 24:59.739
He beat her one last time
and then she snapped.

24:59.782 --> 25:01.956
She claims she was at a hotel
that night.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.695
Uh, credit card records show
no hotel or motel charges,

25:04.739 --> 25:06.565
but it looks like she made
more than a few calls, boss.

25:06.608 --> 25:07.956
To who?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.434
One to her husband,
one to voice mail,

25:10.478 --> 25:11.565
and one to...

25:11.608 --> 25:12.826
[typing]

25:12.869 --> 25:14.521
...him.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.043
Oh.

25:18.086 --> 25:20.391
Well, hello there, Mr. Smooth.

25:20.434 --> 25:21.652
Got calls here dating back
several weeks, boss.

25:21.695 --> 25:23.434
Len Feeney told us

25:23.478 --> 25:25.304
he didn't even know
Georgia Wooten.
[Gibbs laughs]

25:25.347 --> 25:27.826
Imagine that.

25:27.869 --> 25:30.043
He lied.

25:30.086 --> 25:32.304
I didn't tell you 'cause
it's none of your business.

25:32.347 --> 25:35.130
Not our business to know
you were friends

25:35.173 --> 25:36.782
with the dead man's wife?

25:36.826 --> 25:39.391
Look, Georgia called me
a few months ago,

25:39.434 --> 25:40.391
looking for Travis.

25:40.434 --> 25:42.782
I'd met her
once or twice.

25:42.826 --> 25:43.782
You know,
she'd pick him up

25:43.826 --> 25:44.913
when he was
too drunk to drive.

25:44.956 --> 25:46.652
This time her voice was shaking.

25:46.695 --> 25:48.043
Something was wrong.

25:48.086 --> 25:50.565
I told her to stay
where she was,

25:50.608 --> 25:52.043
be with her boy.

25:52.086 --> 25:53.434
I'd calm Travis down
before he went home.

25:53.478 --> 25:55.782
So you knew
about the abuse?

25:55.826 --> 25:57.782
We'd talk,
I'd check in with her.

25:57.826 --> 26:00.000
I mean, I would have reported it
myself, but she told me not to.

26:00.043 --> 26:01.913
Said it would just
make things worse.

26:01.956 --> 26:04.695
But maybe she had other plans.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.434
She ever talk
about wanting her husband dead?

26:08.478 --> 26:09.782
Oh, no.

26:09.826 --> 26:13.304
Said she would never kill
the father of her child,

26:13.347 --> 26:14.304
and honestly

26:14.347 --> 26:15.782
I didn't understand it.

26:15.826 --> 26:17.434
Somebody as strong as her?

26:17.478 --> 26:19.086
Well, I believe
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

26:19.130 --> 26:21.434
was too afraid
to confront him.

26:21.478 --> 26:22.782
[chuckles]

26:22.826 --> 26:25.652
His girlfriend
sure wasn't.

26:25.695 --> 26:27.000
Jancey Gilroy?

26:27.043 --> 26:27.913
Mm-hmm.

26:27.956 --> 26:30.652
Travis Wooten attacked her, too?

26:30.695 --> 26:32.217
More like she attacked him.

26:32.260 --> 26:34.217
Happened
that night.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.130
Got so bad I almost had
to call the cops.

26:40.086 --> 26:42.043
Thanks, Jen.

26:42.086 --> 26:43.608
All right, boss,
we got a history of drug

26:43.652 --> 26:45.043
and alcohol abuse.

26:45.086 --> 26:46.478
Girl's in and
out of rehab.

26:46.521 --> 26:47.695
Got a criminal record?

26:47.739 --> 26:49.434
[chuckles]
And does she.

26:49.478 --> 26:51.869
DUI, possession,
assault.

26:51.913 --> 26:53.130
She got kicked
out of high school

26:53.173 --> 26:55.043
for putting another
girl in the hospital.

26:55.086 --> 26:57.782
A real Girl Gone Wild
kind of girl..

26:57.826 --> 26:59.260
ZIVA:
We'll check it out.[hangs up phone]

26:59.304 --> 27:01.086
Gibbs, Ducky found a small chip

27:01.130 --> 27:04.086
of fingernail polish embedded
deep in Travis Wooten's arm.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.826
Traced it
to Ms. Gilroy's beauty salon.

27:06.869 --> 27:08.130
McGee, got a location?

27:08.173 --> 27:10.086
Boss, she hasn't shown up
for work in two days,

27:10.130 --> 27:11.391
and her bank just confirmed

27:11.434 --> 27:12.956
she cashed out
all her accounts this morning.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.043
You got someone looking
for the car?

27:14.086 --> 27:15.086
State police.

27:16.521 --> 27:18.043
Find her.

27:24.304 --> 27:26.652
[engine accelerating,
tires screeching]

27:26.695 --> 27:28.260
[car doors open]

27:28.304 --> 27:29.956
Let me see your hands.

27:38.434 --> 27:40.869
Going somewhere, Ms. Gilroy?

27:40.913 --> 27:42.782
[handcuffs clicking]

27:42.826 --> 27:43.782
I didn't kill Travis.

27:43.826 --> 27:46.217
I loved him.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.130
Love do that?

27:48.565 --> 27:50.913
We were passionate.

27:50.956 --> 27:52.173
Sometimes we got physical.

27:52.217 --> 27:53.173
So what?

27:53.217 --> 27:54.217
A lot of couples do.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.304
It's no big deal.

27:55.347 --> 27:58.043
It is if one of
them ends up dead.

28:02.478 --> 28:04.521
So what happened?

28:04.565 --> 28:05.565
Find out he
was married?

28:05.608 --> 28:06.565
You snap?

28:06.608 --> 28:07.956
No.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.043
ZIVA:
If the sergeant
was married,

28:09.086 --> 28:10.782
what do you think
that makes you?

28:13.173 --> 28:15.347
We had something special,
all right?

28:15.391 --> 28:17.347
He tell you that?

28:17.391 --> 28:20.173
N... I-I just knew.

28:20.217 --> 28:21.869
Or maybe it is
what you wanted to believe.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.956
I thought Travis was different
than the other guys.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.565
I thought he really
wanted to be with me.

28:28.608 --> 28:29.652
He used you.

28:29.695 --> 28:31.521
He threw me away
like a piece of trash.

28:31.565 --> 28:32.565
I got things to offer.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.000
I'm not trash, you know.

28:34.043 --> 28:35.478
Made you angry.

28:35.521 --> 28:38.347
I wanted to hurt him like
he hurt me, make him suffer.

28:38.391 --> 28:39.434
So you finished the job?

28:41.608 --> 28:43.391
I'm pregnant.

28:45.086 --> 28:47.043
As mad as I was,
I would never kill him.

28:47.086 --> 28:48.652
Sergeant Wooten know that?

28:48.695 --> 28:51.869
I told him that night.

28:51.913 --> 28:53.434
And that is why you fought?

28:53.478 --> 28:54.826
He lost it.

28:54.869 --> 28:56.652
Started telling me
he already had a wife and a kid

28:56.695 --> 29:00.000
and calling me
all kinds of names.

29:00.043 --> 29:03.434
I ran out of the club, I got
a cab, and I never looked back.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.826
Well, a D.C. cab service
confirms Gilroy took

29:12.869 --> 29:14.652
one of their cabs that night.

29:14.695 --> 29:17.043
I don't know whether it was
before or after the murder.

29:17.086 --> 29:18.695
Still in communications
with them.

29:18.739 --> 29:21.173
I need times.
ABBY:
I've got a time
for you, Gibbs.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.956
Well, not atime
but something that keeps time--

29:24.000 --> 29:26.173
although I've never really
understood that expression
because it's not

29:26.217 --> 29:27.173
like you can
get it back--

29:27.217 --> 29:28.260
you know, time, I mean.

29:28.304 --> 29:29.565
Abby.

29:29.608 --> 29:32.391
Um, okay, so you know
that little weird mark

29:32.434 --> 29:34.217
that was on the back
of Sergeant Wooten's neck?

29:34.260 --> 29:36.652
Not from a chain at all.

29:41.217 --> 29:42.260
A watch band?

29:42.304 --> 29:44.478
A vintage Belle and Sloane

29:44.521 --> 29:46.043
1959 special edition

29:46.086 --> 29:48.043
14-karat gold-
plated watch band,

29:48.086 --> 29:49.347
to be exact.

29:49.391 --> 29:51.260
There was only 700 sold
in the United States,

29:51.304 --> 29:54.478
and our killer
is wearing one.

29:54.521 --> 29:56.695
Well, then Jancey Gilroy
is not our killer.

29:56.739 --> 29:59.869
Cab service just sent over
footage from inside the taxi.

29:59.913 --> 30:01.260
Look at this.

30:01.304 --> 30:03.869
Meter begins
at 12:37 a.m.

30:03.913 --> 30:06.826
at Feeney's
Billiard Club--

30:06.869 --> 30:10.782
note no watch--
and the ride ends at 12:55

30:10.826 --> 30:12.913
at 6301
Kentwood Circle.

30:12.956 --> 30:16.739
That's Gilroy's address-- 20
miles from Travis Wooten's home.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.695
What now, boss?

30:48.086 --> 30:49.956
[phone rings]

30:51.869 --> 30:54.043
McGee.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.130
GIBBS:
McGee, I'm in autopsy.

30:56.173 --> 30:58.652
Put up Georgia Wooten's
training video.

30:58.695 --> 31:01.000
Right, on it.[typing]

31:04.521 --> 31:05.782
Fast-forward.

31:08.695 --> 31:09.652
Stop it.

31:09.695 --> 31:11.565
There, zoom in.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.391
Well, it looks
like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten

31:21.434 --> 31:23.217
fought back after all.

31:23.260 --> 31:25.086
Yeah, and this time she killed.

31:34.695 --> 31:35.652
Nice and tight.

31:35.695 --> 31:38.130
Tuck the chin,
drive it through.

31:38.173 --> 31:40.521
Okay.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.391
Gunny, tell your people
to stand by.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.956
Sergeant,
you've got it?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.869
Corporal McNeil,
front and center.

31:48.913 --> 31:51.043
You need to come with us.

31:51.086 --> 31:52.695
I don't understand.

31:52.739 --> 31:54.695
Do not make this
more difficult for yourself.

31:54.739 --> 31:57.173
[Sergeant speaking indistinctly]

31:59.913 --> 32:02.391
No handcuffs, please,
not in front of them.

32:11.173 --> 32:13.565
You're in pain.

32:13.608 --> 32:15.217
You don't know
anything about me.

32:18.217 --> 32:19.565
I know more than you think.

32:22.391 --> 32:23.826
July 27, 2005.

32:23.869 --> 32:28.130
Admitted to Bethlehem Emergency
for a fractured jaw.

32:28.173 --> 32:30.043
September 4, 2008.

32:30.086 --> 32:31.521
Different hospital.

32:31.565 --> 32:32.913
Lacerations
to the legs and arms.

32:32.956 --> 32:34.782
March 17, 2010.

32:34.826 --> 32:36.043
Bruised rib,
broken clavicle.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.652
Enough.

32:47.739 --> 32:49.695
I am not a victim.

32:49.739 --> 32:51.173
No.

32:51.217 --> 32:52.130
No, you're not.

32:52.173 --> 32:53.391
You're a survivor.

33:06.695 --> 33:09.043
[sighs, sniffing]

33:09.086 --> 33:12.347
You know, I, uh...

33:12.391 --> 33:14.086
I could take the beatings.

33:14.130 --> 33:16.260
I mean, they'd happened
for so long,

33:16.304 --> 33:17.869
I didn't even feel
the pain anymore.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.304
[sniffles]

33:19.347 --> 33:21.217
Even when he, uh...

33:24.782 --> 33:27.173
...when he made sure
to hit me in places that...

33:27.217 --> 33:30.130
no one would see.

33:30.173 --> 33:32.869
But Travis knew

33:32.913 --> 33:34.000
I was getting numb...

33:34.043 --> 33:35.826
[sniffles]

33:35.869 --> 33:38.217
...so,

33:38.260 --> 33:40.217
he started looking

33:40.260 --> 33:41.782
for new ways to hurt me.

33:41.826 --> 33:44.217
You know, to control me.

33:48.739 --> 33:51.000
He was looking
for my breaking point.

33:51.043 --> 33:52.608
[sniffles]

33:54.434 --> 33:56.304
That night, he found it.

33:57.478 --> 33:59.478
[sniffles]

33:59.521 --> 34:01.478
He found the...

34:01.521 --> 34:03.478
the one thing

34:03.521 --> 34:05.695
that could make me... break.

34:08.086 --> 34:10.000
[softly]:
Your child.

34:10.043 --> 34:12.043
[sniffles]

34:12.086 --> 34:14.043
He...

34:14.086 --> 34:15.913
He threatened
to take Jacob.

34:15.956 --> 34:17.913
[crying]

34:17.956 --> 34:21.304
You know, he'd tell the courts
that I was unfit,

34:21.347 --> 34:24.130
that I been written up
for fighting on the job,

34:24.173 --> 34:26.782
that I was away on duty
more than I was home.

34:31.608 --> 34:33.956
He said,
by the time he was done,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.391
I would never see Jacob again.

34:36.434 --> 34:39.608
You can hurt me
all you want,

34:39.652 --> 34:41.086
but you don't touch my child.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.869
I'd die for him.

34:45.913 --> 34:47.739
Would you kill?

34:51.260 --> 34:54.130
I grabbed Jacob, and I ran.

34:54.173 --> 34:56.260
I mean, I'd run before.

34:56.304 --> 35:00.043
I just always came back,
but this time...

35:00.086 --> 35:02.434
I knew we had
to disappear.

35:02.478 --> 35:05.652
I knew how to run
from my husband.

35:05.695 --> 35:07.695
I didn't know how to kill him.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.695
It wasn't me, Agent Gibbs.

35:16.304 --> 35:18.260
Tony, this is huge.

35:18.304 --> 35:20.652
You realize the FBI says

35:20.695 --> 35:23.478
that I might be involved in this
Russian identity theft ring?

35:23.521 --> 35:25.347
Calm down, McSpiracy.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.869
Before you go all global,

35:26.913 --> 35:29.608
let's take a look at this
list of charges again.

35:29.652 --> 35:31.565
Come on.
I don't have time
for this.

35:31.608 --> 35:33.260
Back in my Baltimore
Homicide days,

35:33.304 --> 35:34.478
I'd do 20 of these a week.

35:34.521 --> 35:36.565
You never did cyber crime.

35:36.608 --> 35:39.826
No, but I did take a Saturday
seminar once, and I excelled.

35:39.869 --> 35:41.739
Hit me.

35:48.086 --> 35:50.434
Hmm.

35:50.478 --> 35:52.434
Meltdown Comics,

35:52.478 --> 35:54.739
Lola's Pleasure
Chest, GameStop

35:54.782 --> 35:57.695
and Relax the Back.

35:59.956 --> 36:01.391
I've got it.

36:01.434 --> 36:03.521
Your identity thief
is a 14-year-old

36:03.565 --> 36:05.304
pimpled-faced
comic book fanatic

36:05.347 --> 36:07.217
with severe
osteoporosis.

36:08.739 --> 36:10.739
Thank you so much
for your help, Tony.

36:10.782 --> 36:12.521
You know I'm here for you.

36:14.043 --> 36:15.521
Talk to me, Abbs.

36:15.565 --> 36:17.391
Oh, I'm not the one
who's talking, Gibbs.

36:17.434 --> 36:18.608
That is.

36:18.652 --> 36:20.260
And it happens
to have a really

36:20.304 --> 36:21.869
thick Irish brogue.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.652
Sorry. You lost me.

36:24.695 --> 36:28.043
Okay, you remember the varnish
chips that I could not trace?

36:28.086 --> 36:30.521
Well, there was
a reason for that.

36:30.565 --> 36:34.000
And it comes all the way
from the rolling hills of--

36:34.043 --> 36:36.652
wait for it,
wait for it...

36:38.521 --> 36:40.869
...County Donegal, Ireland.

36:40.913 --> 36:43.304
The company's called
McClendon's Fine Finishes.

36:43.347 --> 36:44.782
They specialize
in high-end varnishes

36:44.826 --> 36:47.608
that are used for one thing
and one thing only.

36:47.652 --> 36:49.304
You want to guess what that is?

36:51.434 --> 36:53.434
Okay. I'll show you.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.347
[keyboard keys clacking]

36:59.304 --> 37:01.043
Break a pool cue in half,

37:01.086 --> 37:02.434
and you've got one
killer weapon.

37:02.478 --> 37:04.086
So to speak.

37:11.956 --> 37:13.695
You need to start calling
first, Agent DiNozzo.

37:13.739 --> 37:14.913
I'm in a meeting.

37:14.956 --> 37:16.043
It can wait.

37:16.086 --> 37:18.826
Excuse us?

37:18.869 --> 37:20.173
Well,

37:20.217 --> 37:22.304
at least let me offer you
a drink first.

37:22.347 --> 37:25.043
Just got a nice imported
single malt in, hmm?

37:25.086 --> 37:28.086
That's not the only thing
you've got imported.

37:28.130 --> 37:32.000
It's a 1999 Scarpello
limited edition.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.608
African blackwood.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.956
Made a chess set
out of this once.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.739
It's incredibly dense.

37:38.782 --> 37:40.565
Top of the line.

37:40.608 --> 37:43.347
Like things how I like 'em.

37:43.391 --> 37:47.347
People ever mess with the things
you like, Mr. Feeney?

37:47.391 --> 37:49.739
Oh, they're wise not to.

37:49.782 --> 37:52.347
So, uh, Sergeant Wooten--

37:52.391 --> 37:55.043
guess he wasn't
too wise, huh?

37:55.086 --> 37:56.434
[laughs]

37:56.478 --> 37:57.782
That's insane.

37:57.826 --> 37:59.000
You think I'd risk all of this

37:59.043 --> 38:00.391
for Wooten?

38:00.434 --> 38:03.391
No, not for him, but I think
you would for his wife.

38:23.565 --> 38:26.565
Georgia.

38:29.391 --> 38:32.521
Hearing your voice that night,
how scared you were, I...

38:32.565 --> 38:35.043
I had to
confront Travis.

38:35.086 --> 38:36.956
I-I had to
stop him.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.391
He came at me,

38:39.434 --> 38:41.391
and once I hit him,
I couldn't stop.

38:41.434 --> 38:45.347
I kept pounding and pounding
on him over and over again

38:45.391 --> 38:47.608
until I couldn't
anymore.

38:51.608 --> 38:54.000
I'd do anything for you.

38:59.608 --> 39:01.478
Take me home.

39:04.565 --> 39:05.521
Please?

39:15.130 --> 39:19.086
[handcuffs clicking]

39:19.130 --> 39:21.521
Tell me, you wouldn't have done
the same thing?

39:25.521 --> 39:28.391
TONY: So you haven't seen The
Hunt for Red October?
BOY:
Nope.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.695
Yeah, it's when Alec Baldwin
was skinny.

39:32.086 --> 39:34.130
This your new best
friend, Tony?Oh, he's not here

39:34.173 --> 39:35.826
to see me.
Tim McGee?

39:37.086 --> 39:38.652
Meet Tim McGee.

39:39.826 --> 39:40.913
'Sup, dude?

39:40.956 --> 39:42.217
Hello.

39:42.260 --> 39:44.695
I don't get it.

39:44.739 --> 39:48.347
Well, Tim, there are two kinds
of identity thieves.

39:48.391 --> 39:50.000
There's the kind
you never know,

39:50.043 --> 39:52.434
and there's the kind
that knows you so well,

39:52.478 --> 39:53.521
that they're aware
you're not home

39:53.565 --> 39:55.391
from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.043
You're Mrs. Miller's kid, right?

39:58.086 --> 39:59.869
Nick?Who is Mrs. Miller?

39:59.913 --> 40:01.217
It's McGee's landlady,

40:01.260 --> 40:03.391
the holder
of the keys.
Oh.

40:03.434 --> 40:04.695
She also has a bad back.
[squeaks]

40:07.043 --> 40:08.695
It was you?!

40:09.869 --> 40:11.608
You stole my identity?

40:11.652 --> 40:13.565
You sent me an
inflatable girlfriend?

40:13.608 --> 40:15.434
You know, I'm out
almost ten grand.

40:15.478 --> 40:17.260
Dude, it's fraud,

40:17.304 --> 40:19.695
and you're only liable
for, like, 50 bucks.

40:19.739 --> 40:21.695
Yeah, dude.

40:21.739 --> 40:24.608
Why? Why did you
do this to me?

40:24.652 --> 40:26.739
You're always doing
the same thing.

40:26.782 --> 40:29.478
Go to work, come home,
go to work again.

40:29.521 --> 40:31.304
You even order
the same take-out food

40:31.347 --> 40:32.521
every single night.

40:32.565 --> 40:34.521
Not every night.
Dude, yes.

40:34.565 --> 40:37.956
You got to start living.
You're too young to act so old.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.130
[Tony laughs]

40:39.173 --> 40:41.217
You're welcome.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.086
[sighs]
Can we go to GameStop now?

40:43.130 --> 40:44.521
TONY:
Yeah, man.
My little dude.

40:44.565 --> 40:45.739
You want to come?

40:45.782 --> 40:47.347
Tony, I got all
this paperwork.

40:47.391 --> 40:48.565
I got to...[Tony clears his throat]

40:52.434 --> 40:53.826
All right, you know what?

40:53.869 --> 40:55.565
Let's go. I'd love to.

40:55.608 --> 40:56.434
Excellent.

40:56.478 --> 40:58.347
Smokin' hot chick.

40:58.391 --> 41:00.130
Can she come, too?

41:03.217 --> 41:04.521
Cool it, Nick.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.391
[laughs]

41:07.434 --> 41:09.434
You know you're still
gonna owe me that 50 bucks.

41:09.478 --> 41:13.478
Talk to my mom, bro.
