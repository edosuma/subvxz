I was just wonderin'
why that compass is... is doin' that.

Must be a magnetic disturbance.
Ah.

We, uh... We hit an air pocket?

Why is it we don't hit air pockets

06:36.295 --> 06:38.286
Just lucky, I guess.

That was... That was because
we hit an air pocket.

Oh, nothing.

Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh...
just stomach cramps.

- Stewardess? That's gettin' awful formal,

<i>You heard the lady, Eddie.</i>
<i>Another mai tai.</i>

08:25.571 --> 08:27.562
Okay.

08:31.010 --> 08:36.607
Pilots. Ask them to do anything
except fly you from point "A" to point "B,"
and they act like they're doin' you a favor.

08:36.682 --> 08:41.119
Oh, right now, I just want them
to get to point "B."
That's all I want them to do.

Mrs. Cutter, you are still thinking

Hey, take it easy.

Oh, look at this plane.

<i>My gosh.</i>
<i>Do you know that in World War II...</i>

<i>the Grumman Goose was used</i>
<i>to chase down German U-boats?</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:15.707
Maybe he is, but I'm not.
In case you don't remember,
I don't drive these things.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.148
Well, you did great as a...
as a rocket test pilot.
I crashed.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.085
Not before you broke
Mach 3 first.
Among other things.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.622
Come on. It's easy. It's like...
It's like ridin' a bike.

10:24.690 --> 10:28.217
Yeah. Only,
when you fall off of a plane,
you crash and burn.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.319
Uh, it's called "buying the farm."

10:30.396 --> 10:32.626
Well, whatever it's called, you're dead.

To Bermuda.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.315
I know that.
Yes, it's nice.
Yeah. Only you never get there.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.821
We crash?
No. Calm down.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.255
We crash?
No. You don't crash.
You turn around,

10:59.325 --> 11:02.886
and you go back
to Norwich, Virginia,
which is where you took off from.

11:02.962 --> 11:06.022
Why? W-We have some kind of
engine trouble or somethin'.
Is that it?

11:06.098 --> 11:11.161
Well, I would imagine there's some
kind of a problem, mechanical, or else
why... why would you go back?

11:11.237 --> 11:14.331
Ex-Except...
Except... Except what?

11:14.407 --> 11:19.902
Well, uh, it's only an hour
to Bermuda, and it's four hours
back to Norwich, Virginia,

11:19.979 --> 11:22.948
so why, you know...
if you got a problem...
go all the way back?

11:23.015 --> 11:27.111
Why... don't we ask Ziggy?
Huh?

11:27.186 --> 11:28.847
Ziggy.
Oh! Ask... Ask Ziggy.

11:28.921 --> 11:32.357
Well, okay. I'll ask Ziggy, but I'm having
a lot of problems with it today.
[Squealing]

11:32.425 --> 11:35.656

What's wrong with it?
Uh, Ziggy says... I don't know.

11:59.285 --> 12:03.449
If we're only an hour away from Bermuda,
why don't we just go there,
to the nearest hospital?

12:03.522 --> 12:07.754
Well, that's probably
what you're here to do.
Well, l...

Why are we turning?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.903
Our compass is out; our gyro's tumbled.

12:28.981 --> 12:32.883
<i>And I can't reach Bermuda on the bird dog.</i>
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

12:32.952 --> 12:38.788
Flyin' west, we can't miss the mainland,
but flyin' east, we sure as hell
can miss Bermuda.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.759
The compass seems to be settling down.

12:41.827 --> 12:45.820
That's because
we're flyin' back out of it.
Out of what?

12:45.898 --> 12:47.832
The Bermuda Triangle.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.481
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>We're flying in the Bermuda Triangle?</i>

13:03.549 --> 13:08.851
Ooh, not for long.
We're flyin' due west,
so we should be out of it soon.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.358
Then we'll get our compass and radio back
and be able to set course for Norwich.

13:13.425 --> 13:17.486
If the wind hasn't changed,
we should set down in, uh,
three and a half hours.

13:17.563 --> 13:21.226
Yeah, but we're just an hour
from Bermuda.
We can't find Bermuda.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.500
You gotta be able to see
hundreds of miles... at this altitude.

13:27.573 --> 13:31.566
I mean, I would think if we just turned
around and headed back east, we'd...
we're bound to spot Bermuda.

13:31.644 --> 13:36.138
It's gotta be right there with... We'd see it.
We don't know how far
the autopilot's taken us off course.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.514
Now Bermuda could be
over the horizon, north of us.

13:39.585 --> 13:43.487
I got a feeling that... the autopilot
wasn't that far off.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.049
Eddie, you haven't been flyin'
long enough to have gut feelings.
<i>[Switch Clicks]</i>

13:48.127 --> 13:51.187
Now what is the rush to get to Bermuda?
Now we'll... we'll return to Norwich.

13:51.263 --> 13:55.757
We'll get the autopilot fixed
and takeJunior and his bride
to Bermuda tomorrow.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.827
She may not have a tomorrow.
What do you mean?

13:58.904 --> 14:02.840
She's got stomach pains.
I think it's appendicitis.
Oh, damn.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.877
That's why we gotta get her
to the nearest hospital,
and that's in Bermuda.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.642
[Sighs]
Well, not if we can't find it.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.411
Look. Go back.
Check on her again. Uh,

14:12.484 --> 14:16.011
tellJunior we're returnin' to Norwich
due to, uh, mechanical problems.

14:16.088 --> 14:20.024
Look, Coop. I don't think...
Look. That's an order, kid.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.475
[Squealing]

14:37.543 --> 14:39.477
Al, Al, what's wrong?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.378
What are you doing?
[Grunts]
This thing has gone blooey on me.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.042
I can't get anything on it.

14:45.117 --> 14:48.609
It's because we're in the...
Bermuda Triangle.

14:48.687 --> 14:51.713
It's because the hand-link
always goes blooey.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.724
Not <i>this</i> blooey.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.251
You're not gonna tell me that you
believe all the myths, are you?

14:57.329 --> 15:00.958
Sam, a lot of freaky things
have happened out here.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.831
There are ships that disappear,
planes vanish,

15:03.903 --> 15:08.670
even on clear days... like this one.

15:08.741 --> 15:13.974
Disasters at sea are not that uncommon,
even on clear days like this one.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.980
There's theories that say...

15:16.048 --> 15:20.712
that it's either
electromagnetic vortices, or else it's...

15:20.786 --> 15:22.777
Or sea monsters.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.789
How did you know?
Right. I remember.

15:24.857 --> 15:28.691
Giant prehistoric lizard fish
have been seen by sailors...

15:28.761 --> 15:31.696
[Stifling Laugh]
In the Ber... What's so funny?
What are you laughin' about?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.961
I'm just joking, okay?
This is no joke, Sam.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.800
If I wasn't a hologram,
I wouldn't be caught dead out here.
[Ziggy Squeals, Beeps]

15:38.871 --> 15:43.069
[Sighs]
Oh. It's back.

15:44.410 --> 15:49.438
And we've flown...
out of the Triangle.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.449
How do you explain that?

15:53.385 --> 15:57.617
Could be that U.F.O.
That's been circling us.
Oh, you... What U.F. O?

15:57.690 --> 16:01.023
You... What U.F. O? Where's the...
I don't see a U. F...

16:02.094 --> 16:06.224
Oh, boy.
The Triangle swallowed him up.
Sam...

16:06.298 --> 16:09.665
<i>[Ziggy Beeping]</i>
Sam, where the hell did he go?
Al...

16:09.735 --> 16:11.669
S...
[Yelps]
Oh, no. Come on.

16:11.737 --> 16:15.070
[Sighs] That's not funny, Sam.
Oh, Al, what's wrong with you?
Now come on.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.438
God!
Give me a heart attack.

16:17.509 --> 16:22.970
Now that Ziggy is back, could you
at least tell me what happened
to Michelle? Can't believe you.

16:24.049 --> 16:29.385
Uh, well, back when this
happened originally...
Yeah? What?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.389
Oh.
What?

16:31.457 --> 16:35.723
Her... Her appendix burst,
and she died.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.958
She died on board?
Yeah, an hour before
they landed in Norwich.

16:40.032 --> 16:45.197
She must have gone hypotensive.
Hyp... Yeah, uh, h-hypotensive.

16:45.270 --> 16:49.673
Al, we gotta get her to Bermuda...
to the hospital there.
How you gonna find it?

16:49.742 --> 16:52.506
Well, I can't, but you can.
Have Ziggy get us a heading.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.479
- <i>[Curtain Slides]</i>
- Eddie, you better
take a look at this kid.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.345
She's startin' to scare me.

16:58.417 --> 17:02.820
I thought she'd feel better after she threw up
and we got her a change of clothes, but...

17:02.888 --> 17:05.721
She's really hurting.
Hey.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.021
Can I take a look?
I'm a married woman.
[Laughs]

17:09.094 --> 17:12.290
That's okay, honey.
Eddie's a married man.
L...

17:13.866 --> 17:17.926
- Yeah. L... See, I am, so...
- Okay. See.

17:19.003 --> 17:24.101
Ooh.
Look. Um, you tell me if you feel
any pain, okay, and where it is?

17:24.175 --> 17:26.609
[Michelle Breathing Heavily]

17:26.678 --> 17:29.647
<i>No! I can't...</i>
Yeah, there's a little swelling
right there.

17:29.715 --> 17:34.652
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'm gonna check the medical kit and
see if I can find something to relieve the pain.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.745
- She gonna be all right?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.052
It's just a little upset stomach.

17:39.124 --> 17:43.458
- Well, actually, it's a little... upset appendix.
- Appendix?

17:43.529 --> 17:45.997
- Yeah.
- You sure?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.898
Eddie went to med school for a year
before becoming a pilot.

17:48.967 --> 17:53.904
- Yeah, well, that doesn't make him a doctor.
- Yeah, well, maybe not, but I've...
seen these symptoms before.

17:53.972 --> 17:57.169
Got a fever, swelling, tenderness.
Odds are it's her appendix.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.405
- Well, what should we do?
- Get her to a hospital.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.505
Mmm, it's all my fault. I'm sorry.
No. It's not.

18:03.582 --> 18:08.076
Yes, it is. I knew there was pain
before we boarded, and I just
thought it would go away.

18:08.153 --> 18:12.214
I didn't want to ruin
our honeymoon. I'm sorry.
You're not ruining anything.

18:12.291 --> 18:16.022
- And I bought this nice lace negligee.
- Wear it in the hospital.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.828
Yeah, sure. You can shake up
all those stuffy British nurses.
[Laughing]

18:20.899 --> 18:25.131
Oh, we're not gonna go to...
Uh, that... That would shake 'em up,
all right, if she wore a... a negligee.

18:25.204 --> 18:29.698
You keep her quiet, all right, Grant?
And, uh, I'll send Wendy back in a second
with something for the pain.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.766
- Thank you, Mr. Brackett.
- Eddie. Call me Eddie.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.575
[Moaning]
L...

18:35.647 --> 18:39.811
How am I gonna
keep you quiet?
Mmm.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.084
<i>We're flying back to Norwich.</i>

18:49.161 --> 18:52.790
She's not gonna make it back to Norwich.
Excuse me.
She's that bad?

18:52.865 --> 18:55.197
Yeah. She's that bad.
What are you looking for?

18:55.267 --> 18:57.997
Uh, we have a medical kit
or something like that?
Here.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.638
There's gotta be some aspirin
in here or something.
Here.

19:01.707 --> 19:05.609
Okay. Give her three aspirin...
uh, that should help with the pain...
and a hot water bottle, okay?

19:05.677 --> 19:07.611
There's not one on board.
Well...

19:07.679 --> 19:10.147
All right. Heat up some towels
in the microwave.

19:10.215 --> 19:14.242
Microwave?
Take some towels, put 'em in hot water,
and use 'em on her, okay?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.253
Okay.
I'll go talk to Cooper.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.448
They're back.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.019
Who's back?

19:25.097 --> 19:27.088
Compass and gyro.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.703
I told you.

19:33.772 --> 19:37.469
Then we can fly
to Bermuda, right?
Don't start, Eddie.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.138
You know what, Sam?
This guy has got the right stuff.

19:42.214 --> 19:46.878
You just have to convince him
that the girl is gonna die
unless he gets to Bermuda.

19:46.952 --> 19:51.013
Look. Michelle's appendix is gonna rupture,
and when it does, she'll die.

19:52.090 --> 19:55.548
[Sighs]
You know, the docs took
my appendix out when I was 16.

19:55.627 --> 19:58.687
Turned out all I really had was
a gastritis attack.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.256
But since they had me open,
they took it out anyway.
[Chuckles]

20:02.334 --> 20:06.293
Now what if... what if all Michelle
is sufferin' from is gastritis?
This is not gastritis.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.068
This is an attack of acute appendicitis.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.305
I'm not gonna risk her life
and everyone else's on
your medical judgment, Eddie.

20:13.378 --> 20:18.315
<i>Oh, Sam, I've got our location.</i>
<i>We're a hundred and thirty-seven miles</i>
<i>southwest of Bermuda.</i>

20:18.383 --> 20:22.979
And you just take a heading of 077...
It'll take us right into Hamilton Harbor.

20:23.055 --> 20:28.994
Look, Cooper, l...
I've been doing a little figuring,
and I think I know where we are.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.394
If we take a heading of 0...

20:32.464 --> 20:38.130
- 77.
- 77, that heading will run us
smack dab right into Bermuda.

20:38.203 --> 20:42.264
[Laughs]
You've been doin' some figuring.
Yeah.

20:42.341 --> 20:45.105
Well, I've been flyin' for 20 years,
and I don't know where the hell we are.

<i>In 1944, Cooper located and sunk</i>
<i>seven U-boats in the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

This guy has spent more time in the Triangle
than half the ships that disappeared.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.669
Well, then why is he so reluctant
to fly back into it?

21:50.742 --> 21:54.803
Well, maybe because he respects it,
or he knows how lethal...

21:54.880 --> 21:57.576

It can... it can be.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.776
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh?

21:59.851 --> 22:05.448
Uh-oh. In November of that year,
Cooper and the three aircraft
he was leading...

22:07.025 --> 22:09.585
disappeared without a trace.

22:09.661 --> 22:13.392
Disappeared without...
Al, the guy's right here.
He's flyin' the plane.

22:13.465 --> 22:16.491
Yeah, yeah. Well, eight days later,
he was picked up,

22:16.568 --> 22:20.060
still wearing his Mae West,
by a passing tanker.
[Sighs]

22:20.138 --> 22:26.077
It was a miracle. But no one knows
what happened to the rest of his flight...
not even him.

Yeah. Geez, even in the '50s,
there weren't very many of those left.

That's how she died, Al.

31:37.629 --> 31:42.965
But if I can get this saline solution into her,
it'll elevate her blood pressure
until we reach Bermuda.

- Will this work?
- Oh, boy.

<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

41:06.964 --> 41:08.955
Lift.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.297
Come on, baby.
Just a few more feet.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.510
<i>Attagirl. Come on.</i>

41:21.579 --> 41:23.843
Come on.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.849
- <i>[Engine Roaring]</i>
- That-a-girl. Come on.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.852
<i>[Engine Continues Roaring]</i>

41:29.920 --> 41:32.548
That-a-girl. Come on.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.635
[Sam]
We threw out everything
that wasn't tied down.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.638
[Wendy]
Yeah, and a few things that were.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.368
Well, it bought us 300 feet.
We're livin'.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.014
Look!

42:05.956 --> 42:10.757
Is that Bermuda?
What the hell else could it be
in the middle of the Atlantic?

42:10.828 --> 42:12.762
[Laughs]
Whoo!

42:12.830 --> 42:16.288
I guess it wasn't our day to die.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.358
[Sam, Wendy Laughing]

42:23.841 --> 42:26.173
Coop is radioing for an ambulance.

42:26.243 --> 42:29.770
I'm sorry I caused so much trouble.
[Wendy Laughs]

42:29.847 --> 42:35.786
I know you're Mrs. Grant CutterJr,
but I didn't know you could cause a storm.
[Laughs]

42:37.121 --> 42:41.990
[Man On Speaker]
A doctor and an ambulance are on the way.
Will you need assistance docking? Over.

42:42.059 --> 42:46.553
Assistance would be appreciated.
Five-five-niner out.

42:48.465 --> 42:50.399
I don't figure this.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.833
I mean, your radio's workin' now.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.167
<i>The instruments are all working.</i>

42:55.239 --> 42:58.402
Everything is back to normal.
Well, I guess
we're out of the Triangle.

42:58.475 --> 43:00.636
<i>Technically, he's right, Sam.</i>

43:00.711 --> 43:05.341
- See, Bermuda is on
the northernmost point of the Triangle.
- Where have you been?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.941
What?

43:08.018 --> 43:12.751
I was just thinking, you know,
that's what the Custom guys
are gonna say to us when they see us.

43:12.823 --> 43:15.621
"Where have you been, you guys?"
Caught in the Bermuda Triangle.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.594
<i>Yeah, uh, that's why</i>
<i>you and I disappeared, Sam.</i>

43:18.662 --> 43:22.496
Although Ziggy says
there was a power failure,
and that's why we lost connec... but, l...

43:22.566 --> 43:25.034
It was the damn Triangle that did it.

43:26.203 --> 43:28.501
You really believe in
the Bermuda Triangle, don't you?

43:28.572 --> 43:31.063
- Yes.
- I don't know.

43:31.141 --> 43:34.633
I swear my boys were out there
flyin'just off our wing.

43:34.712 --> 43:36.703
And could that've all
have been my imagination?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.680
- No.
- Yes.

43:38.749 --> 43:43.152
I mean, the instruments,
the Liberty ship and
everything happening again?

43:43.220 --> 43:46.155
Coincidence
or scientifically explainable.

43:46.223 --> 43:49.192
Aw, Sam.
<i>Look. It's obvious that...</i>

43:49.259 --> 43:54.253
there's some sort of
an electromagnetic force
operating in this area,

43:54.331 --> 43:56.993
but that doesn't make it supernatural.

43:57.067 --> 44:01.197
<i>I mean, isn't the North Pole</i>
<i>an electromagnetic disturbance?</i>

44:01.271 --> 44:05.173
- But we don't say that it's caused by ghosts.
- What about the Liberty ship?

44:05.242 --> 44:11.044
In 1956, there had to be
a few Liberty ships still in use, right?

44:11.115 --> 44:15.381
And the music... was the music
the exact same music that you heard
on your first mission?

44:15.452 --> 44:17.818
[Chuckles]
Maybe not. L...

44:17.888 --> 44:21.756
- What side are you on?
- And the lightning. I mean,
we're flyin' a plane in a thunderstorm.

44:21.825 --> 44:25.852
<i>Planes get hit by lightning</i>
<i>all the time.</i>
Sam, I don't believe you.

44:25.929 --> 44:30.525
And most importantly,
everything didn't happen again.

44:30.601 --> 44:35.470
You didn't crash,
and you weren't in the ocean
for eight days in a Mae West.

44:35.539 --> 44:40.567
<i>Although, uh, I wasn't in the water</i>
<i>those eight days in '44.</i>

44:40.644 --> 44:43.579
I was picked up by the U.S. <i>S. Cyclops</i>
the day I went in.

44:43.647 --> 44:47.549
Seven days later, she was torpedoed.
Went down with everyone but me.
[Beeping]

44:47.618 --> 44:50.781
A freighter, the <i>Michael Z.,</i>
picked me up the next day.

44:50.854 --> 44:54.119
Now twice, in eight days,
I was the only survivor.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.388
Well, that is quite... a coincidence.

44:57.461 --> 44:59.554
Yeah. I guess so.

44:59.630 --> 45:04.829
Uh, Sam, the U.S. <i>S. Cyclops...</i>

45:04.902 --> 45:10.033
disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle
in 1918...

45:11.108 --> 45:15.204
<i>26 years before Cooper was picked up.</i>

45:26.090 --> 45:31.289
[Cheering]
[No Audible Dialogue]

45:31.361 --> 45:33.659
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey! Hey, wait a minute!</i>
What about the First Amendment?

45:33.731 --> 45:36.256
Yeah!
"Congress shall make no act...

45:36.333 --> 45:38.927
"respecting an establishment
of religion...
[Feedback]

45:39.002 --> 45:41.527
And prohibiting
the free exercise thereof'!

45:41.605 --> 45:45.132
Hey! That doesn't include animal
sacrifices and you know it!
<i>[Crowd Affirming]</i>

45:45.209 --> 45:46.972
That's...
Hey! Tell him!

45:47.044 --> 45:48.909
Oh, come on. You know
what I'm talking about!
No. Tell him!

45:48.979 --> 45:52.574
You push me, pal.
You push me...
<i>[Crowd Clamoring]</i>

45:53.650 --> 45:56.619
Hey, hey, hey. All right.
J-Just leave it, all right?
[Grunts]

45:56.687 --> 45:59.588
- <i>[Clamoring Continues]</i>
- [Martial Arts Yell]

45:59.656 --> 46:02.853
Ohhh, boy.
<i>[Man] We got lawyers!</i>

46:02.926 --> 46:05.224
<i>We've got lawyers and we're gonna sue!</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Freedom!</i>

46:05.295 --> 46:08.287
<i>[Man #3]</i>
<i>Freedom! We do as we please!</i>
<i>Fight for freedom!</i>
