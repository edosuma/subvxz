ANNOUNCER:
<i>Previously on</i> American Dad...

00:05.025 --> 00:06.558
Good evening, Tearjerker.

00:06.593 --> 00:08.894
Smith, Stan Smith.

00:08.929 --> 00:11.246
Didn't really ask
who you were, but okay.

00:13.365 --> 00:15.684
Hello again, Mr. Smith.

00:15.719 --> 00:17.753
Will you marry me?

00:17.787 --> 00:19.121
<i>Face it, Tearjerker.</i>

00:19.155 --> 00:21.190
You've jerked your last tear.

00:21.224 --> 00:23.309
I'll be back, Mr. Smith.

00:27.113 --> 00:28.631

00:37.040 --> 00:41.794
Oh, Stan, this vacation cottage
is wonderful!

00:41.828 --> 00:44.763
Only the best for my former
whore of a new bride.

00:44.798 --> 00:45.881
(cell phone ringing)

00:45.899 --> 00:47.066
Yello?

00:47.100 --> 00:49.551
Agent Smith, the world
needs your help again.

00:49.586 --> 00:51.153
There's a new villain who...

00:51.187 --> 00:52.988
Sir, I'm on my honeymoon.

00:53.023 --> 00:54.023
But, Stan...

00:55.742 --> 00:58.010
Want me to go downtown?

00:58.044 --> 00:59.945
All the way downtown,

00:59.980 --> 01:02.114
to the worst neighborhood
on my body.

01:02.148 --> 01:04.166
(moaning)

01:07.220 --> 01:10.723
I could suck your toes all day.

01:10.757 --> 01:12.891
I love you, Stan Smith.

01:12.926 --> 01:15.661
I love you, Sexpun Tocome Smith.

01:15.695 --> 01:18.998
You've made me the happiest man
in the world.

01:19.032 --> 01:20.099
(gun cocks)

01:20.133 --> 01:22.134
Hello, Stan Smith.

01:22.168 --> 01:23.135
Who are you?!

01:23.169 --> 01:24.136
Black Villain.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.371
I've never heard of you.

01:25.405 --> 01:27.740
Uh, because I'm up-and-coming.

01:27.774 --> 01:30.359
But I'm gonna make a name
for myself by killing you!

01:30.393 --> 01:31.393
(grunts)

01:39.235 --> 01:40.402
(groans)

01:54.434 --> 01:55.901
Oh, damn.

01:55.935 --> 01:57.953
You killed my wife!

02:04.611 --> 02:07.713
You look ridiculous.

â™ª

02:53.476 --> 02:55.561
(Irish accent):
You wouldn't be using my hammer,

02:55.595 --> 02:56.845
would you, Murphy?

02:56.863 --> 02:59.148
(Irish accent): Oh, and what if
I was, brother Cillian?

02:59.182 --> 03:01.166
I suppose I'd have to do
something 'bout it.

03:01.201 --> 03:04.369
Oh, and pray tell,
what would that be?

03:04.404 --> 03:06.321
(both yelling)

03:06.355 --> 03:08.107
Come on, guys, break it up.

03:08.141 --> 03:09.591
Shut up, apprentice!

03:09.626 --> 03:11.460
Me hammer!

03:11.494 --> 03:13.345
(grunts)

03:13.379 --> 03:14.980
There you are, Smith.

03:15.014 --> 03:16.965
We've been looking for you.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.451
Did you ever think
that I didn't want to be found?

03:19.486 --> 03:20.903
We need you back, Smith.

03:20.937 --> 03:22.871
Something big and bad
is about to happen,

03:22.889 --> 03:25.207
and I want my best man on it.

03:25.241 --> 03:26.975
I'm out of
the spy business, sir.

03:27.010 --> 03:29.144
That all died when Sexpun did.

03:29.179 --> 03:31.847
What if I told you that
you could catch the man

03:31.881 --> 03:33.232
who killed your wife?

03:33.266 --> 03:34.683
(gasps) Black Villain?

03:34.717 --> 03:35.717
That's right.

03:35.735 --> 03:37.002
He's resurfaced.

03:41.274 --> 03:42.374
(Sexpun screams)

03:47.814 --> 03:49.948
The memories are
so fresh and clear.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.283
It was after that

03:51.317 --> 03:53.685
that I started working
with those Irish roofers.

03:58.558 --> 04:00.526
And then you came here
and asked me

04:00.560 --> 04:02.294
if I wanted to catch
Black Villain.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.581
And then I said yes.

04:05.615 --> 04:07.199
Wait, wait--
did you say yes?

04:07.233 --> 04:09.868
Is this now or is
this you remembering?

04:09.903 --> 04:11.920
How do I know <i>I'm</i>
not a memory?!

04:11.955 --> 04:14.022
I need to know what's real!

04:14.057 --> 04:16.190
Relax, sir. I'm in.

04:16.226 --> 04:17.776
All the way in.

04:17.810 --> 04:20.478
Or as much of me
as you can handle.

04:22.549 --> 04:24.483
Sassy.

04:31.908 --> 04:34.877
Peacenickel, how am I to know
if my strikes are effective

04:34.911 --> 04:36.612
if you keep blocking them?

04:36.646 --> 04:37.613
Hah!

04:37.647 --> 04:39.147
(choking)

04:39.182 --> 04:40.499
Ah, Smith, welcome.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.134
That'll be all, Peacenickel.

04:42.168 --> 04:43.635
(choking)

04:43.670 --> 04:44.636
(kick lands)

04:44.671 --> 04:46.004
Dude.

04:46.039 --> 04:49.758
Here's the intel we have
so far on Black Villain.

04:49.792 --> 04:52.261
He's as evil as he is frugal.

04:52.295 --> 04:54.263
He would've conquered
the world long ago

04:54.297 --> 04:57.499
if he could've figured out how
to do it at a reasonable cost.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.568
Now it appears
he's found a way.

04:59.602 --> 05:01.904
We have reason to believe
that he's planning

05:01.938 --> 05:04.273
a massive attack on
the Eastern seaboard.

05:04.307 --> 05:05.941
Nukes?
We're not sure.

05:05.975 --> 05:07.976
What we do know is
that he's stolen

05:08.011 --> 05:09.544
millions of pounds of sand.

05:09.579 --> 05:13.282
He's also acquired a
crap-load of hair dryers.

05:13.316 --> 05:14.866
Hair dryers?
Yes.

05:14.901 --> 05:18.253
The cheap bastard issued a
fake recall to every salon

05:18.288 --> 05:22.024
in the U.S., saying hair dryers
would make you heterosexual.

05:22.058 --> 05:23.592
They came flooding in.

05:23.626 --> 05:25.294
What is that monster up to?

05:25.328 --> 05:27.729
That's what you need
to find out.

05:27.764 --> 05:29.898
Which is why you'll be
partnered with someone

05:29.933 --> 05:32.668
who also wants revenge
on Black Villain:

05:32.702 --> 05:33.702
Tearjerker.

05:33.736 --> 05:34.703
(gasps)

05:34.737 --> 05:36.438
Tearjerker?! But he's dead!

05:36.472 --> 05:38.106
Why would you think that?

05:38.141 --> 05:39.908
Because he fell in a volcano.

05:39.943 --> 05:41.910
As long as you fall
the right way,

05:41.945 --> 05:43.445
a volcano can never hurt you.

05:43.479 --> 05:45.213
Everyone knows
that, even babies.

05:45.248 --> 05:46.581
Right?

05:47.684 --> 05:51.386
(adult voice):
I... I didn't know that.

05:51.421 --> 05:55.207
(computers beeping,
machines whirring)

05:55.241 --> 05:57.709
After Tearjerker
escaped the volcano,

05:57.744 --> 05:59.461
he partnered up
with Black Villain,

05:59.495 --> 06:02.464
only to have Black Villain
immediately double-cross him.

06:02.498 --> 06:04.199
That's how Tearjerker ended up

06:04.233 --> 06:06.468
in a maximum-security
prison on Easter Island.

06:06.502 --> 06:08.370
So you'll have
to break him out.

06:08.404 --> 06:10.389
How? That prison
is impenetrable.

06:10.423 --> 06:11.540
We'll get you in,

06:11.574 --> 06:13.475
but you'll need this
sandwich to get him out.

06:13.509 --> 06:15.193
What am I supposed
to do with that?

06:15.228 --> 06:17.846
Just get Tearjerker to
eat it. I'll do the rest.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.348
All right, Smith, off you go.

06:19.382 --> 06:21.383
Make sure you check in
as soon as you...

06:21.417 --> 06:23.168
(screams)

06:23.202 --> 06:25.287
Capital thrust, Peacenickel.

06:25.321 --> 06:27.622
That went clean
through my abdomen.

06:27.657 --> 06:30.075
Smith, take our picture.

06:30.109 --> 06:32.661
Quickly now,
before I lose my erection.

06:32.695 --> 06:34.529
(camera clicks)

06:34.564 --> 06:36.548
(mouse clicking,
computer beeping)

06:39.585 --> 06:41.586
(seagulls chirping)

06:51.547 --> 06:53.548
(water dripping)

07:07.630 --> 07:09.630
MAN (over intercom):
You got a visitor, Tearjerker.

07:09.632 --> 07:11.166
Are they hot or not?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.334
Hot!

07:12.368 --> 07:13.869
Phillip, you think
everyone's hot.

07:13.903 --> 07:16.571
Name one person
you don't think is hot.

07:16.606 --> 07:18.840
Ha! See?
You can't do it!

07:18.875 --> 07:20.475
Hello, Tearjerker.

07:20.510 --> 07:22.344
Stan Smith.

07:22.378 --> 07:25.080
You got some set of marbles
coming to see me.

07:25.114 --> 07:26.281
I need your help.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.749
<i>You</i> need <i>my</i> help?

07:27.783 --> 07:29.768
(laughing)

07:33.539 --> 07:37.342
(forced laughing)

07:37.377 --> 07:38.810
I'll never help you.

07:38.845 --> 07:40.178
I'm going after Black Villain.

07:40.213 --> 07:41.613
I will help you.
Okay, then.

07:41.647 --> 07:43.782
First thing we need to do
is get you out of here.

07:43.816 --> 07:46.051
Good luck. This place
is locked down tighter than

07:46.085 --> 07:48.987
a friendship bracelet around
your mom's fat-ass wrist.

07:49.021 --> 07:50.989
Ha, just kidding,
your mom has no friends!

07:51.023 --> 07:53.625
(laughs):
Ho-ho!

07:53.659 --> 07:54.626
Now eat this.

07:54.660 --> 07:55.643
Why?

07:55.661 --> 07:57.662
Just do it.

08:00.566 --> 08:03.568
You haven't said a thing
about my paintings.

08:09.409 --> 08:13.228
Aside from the Havarti cheese,
this sandwich was a total bust.

08:13.262 --> 08:16.264
(screaming)

08:20.853 --> 08:22.521
(electricity crackles)

08:22.555 --> 08:25.273
(shark roaring)

08:27.176 --> 08:29.177
I guess that was
a magnet sandwich.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.482
Looks like we're partners now.

08:33.515 --> 08:36.501
Yeah, you and me, we're gonna
take Black Villain down!

08:38.855 --> 08:40.155
Ow! What are
you doing?!

08:40.188 --> 08:41.506
We're on the same side now!

08:41.541 --> 08:42.823
Oh, right. Partners.

08:42.859 --> 08:43.892
Yes, right.

08:43.926 --> 08:46.411
That... that will take
some getting used to.

08:51.285 --> 08:52.606
If we want to catch
Black Villain,

08:52.694 --> 08:55.407
we have to find his top
henchman, Tchochke Schmear.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.470
He has a booth here
every other Sunday.

08:57.505 --> 08:58.772
Wait, I thought Tchochke
was <i>your</i> henchman.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.773
He was.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.007
But then I went to jail,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.876
and I guess he didn't
want to wait for me.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.445
Some henchmen just can't do
the "alone" thing.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.880
I get it. Whatever.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.782
I mean, it hurts
and it makes no sense to me

09:08.816 --> 09:10.183
and it never will, but I get it.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.752
Just one of those things
I'll never get, you know.

09:12.787 --> 09:14.354
Yeah.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.655
Ooh! Should I buy this?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.223
This old picture of this guy?

09:17.258 --> 09:18.458
Wh-Why would I buy this?

09:18.492 --> 09:20.443
Talk me out of buying this.
I'm buying this.

09:20.478 --> 09:21.661
You know, you never said

09:21.695 --> 09:23.196
how Black Villain
double-crossed you.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.465
You know how Tommy Bahama's
is the best store?

09:25.499 --> 09:27.300
Well, we were gonna open
a competing place

09:27.334 --> 09:28.535
called Johnny Cabo.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.037
But instead, Black Villain
shot me in the face

09:31.071 --> 09:33.840
and turned me in for molesting
my high school gym teacher.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.308
That's right.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.544
I flipped it on him.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.279
Every ceramic frog is $80.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.314
How about this one?

09:43.300 --> 09:45.368
Tchochke Schmear.

09:45.402 --> 09:48.138
Well, well,
if it isn't Tearjerker.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.173
With Stan Smith.

09:50.207 --> 09:52.242
So, you two
are working together?

09:52.276 --> 09:53.443
What's next?

09:53.477 --> 09:56.546
Janeane Garofalo hanging out
with commercial success?

09:56.580 --> 09:58.898
That was a '90s slam!

09:58.933 --> 10:01.367
Tell us where Black Villain is!

10:01.402 --> 10:03.570
I'm not telling you anything!

10:03.604 --> 10:05.288
I'll save you, Tchochke!

10:05.322 --> 10:06.289
Tearjerker! Same side!
(coughing)

10:06.323 --> 10:08.074
Right, right.
Damn it.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.209
Sorry.

10:09.243 --> 10:10.393
All right, all right,
I'll tell you.

10:10.427 --> 10:12.128
The thing you don't know

10:12.163 --> 10:14.464
about Black Villain's
whereabouts that I do is...

10:14.498 --> 10:15.498
(gunshot)

10:19.787 --> 10:22.038
(tires screeching)

10:27.394 --> 10:29.395
Looks like
we're going to Detroit.

10:36.287 --> 10:39.289
(laughter)

10:41.075 --> 10:42.425
It's been two hours.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.794
Why don't we just ask them about
the woman who shot Tchochke?

10:44.828 --> 10:46.788
Because you don't just
walk into a place like this

10:46.814 --> 10:47.895
and start asking questions.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.299
You got to play it cool.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.667
Oh, yeah, no, I knew that.

10:50.701 --> 10:52.335
Look, you didn't know it
and it's fine.

10:52.369 --> 10:54.220
Just let them talk
and eventually they'll tell us

10:54.255 --> 10:55.338
what we need to know.

10:55.372 --> 10:57.340
I hope you told
Craig to shut up.

10:57.374 --> 10:58.341
You know I did.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.509
And I'm done with him.

10:59.543 --> 11:00.843
And he better not show up

11:00.878 --> 11:02.412
at Black Villain's
house party tonight.

11:02.446 --> 11:03.780
Mm-hmm.

11:05.649 --> 11:08.718
We get to that house party,
we get to Black Villain.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.587
Then what're we
waitin' for, fools?

11:10.621 --> 11:12.255
Let's get to that party!

11:12.289 --> 11:13.489
Craig, what are you doing here?

11:13.524 --> 11:15.491
Yeah. Shonteeva doesn't
want to see you, man.

11:15.526 --> 11:16.793
She hates your ass.

11:16.827 --> 11:19.162
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.
Guys, guys, come on, now.

11:19.196 --> 11:20.830
Y'all don't know
my side of the story.

11:20.864 --> 11:21.985
Let's hear your side, Craig.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.199
Oh, I cheated on her.

11:23.234 --> 11:25.034
But you haven't heard why.

11:25.069 --> 11:26.135
Why, Craig?

11:26.170 --> 11:27.303
'Cause I felt like it.

11:28.839 --> 11:31.140
â™ª

11:34.861 --> 11:36.028
Let's split up.

11:36.046 --> 11:37.830
Any sign of Black Villain,
you come find me.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.983
You got it, partner.

11:40.017 --> 11:41.668
No! No!
Aah!

11:41.702 --> 11:44.504
No stab!
Aah! Detroit tap water!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.759
That's the woman
who shot Tchochke.

11:51.862 --> 11:53.496
Out of all the girls here...

11:53.530 --> 11:55.698
I "pick" you.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.684
I know you didn't
just touch my hair.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.868
Sexpun!

11:58.902 --> 11:59.936
You're alive!

11:59.970 --> 12:01.187
Except you're...

12:04.858 --> 12:07.627
Damn, Black Villain,

12:07.661 --> 12:09.395
why'd you have to
park so far away?

12:09.413 --> 12:11.114
It's all meters around here.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.399
I'm not paying for that
when there's free parking

12:13.417 --> 12:15.118
at the library
three miles away.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.453
Sexpun...
is that really you?

12:17.504 --> 12:20.006
No, that's a clone
I made of Sexpun.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.375
I call her Sexpunequa.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.544
She's just like the original,
but better.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.095
I blacked her up.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.514
Blacked her up good.

12:28.549 --> 12:30.216
Sexpun, it's me, Stan.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.768
I missed you so much.

12:31.802 --> 12:33.019
Did you miss me?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.188
Fool, I just told you
that's not Sexpun.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.190
She does not know you.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.309
Do you even know what a clone is?
Yeah, I know.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.943
Look, you don't know
and it's fine.

12:40.978 --> 12:41.978
Mind the curb.

12:46.383 --> 12:48.451
You know, for a
big-time super spy,

12:48.485 --> 12:49.919
you sure get knocked out easy.

12:49.953 --> 12:51.020
That's not true!

12:51.055 --> 12:52.422
Take it back!
Take it back, I said.

12:56.527 --> 12:57.827
Where am I?

12:57.861 --> 12:58.861
What's going on?

12:58.896 --> 13:00.229
You're gonna die.

13:00.264 --> 13:02.665
But first, you want to do
that thing where the bad guy

13:02.700 --> 13:04.667
tells the good guy his plan
before he kills him?

13:04.702 --> 13:06.019
Sure.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.087
BLACK VILLAIN:
I got all these hair dryers

13:08.122 --> 13:09.956
on a polar ice cap
in the Arctic Ocean.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.392
I got extension cords leading
from the hair dryers

13:12.426 --> 13:13.609
to my house in Detroit.

13:13.644 --> 13:16.546
Once I plug them in,
the cap's gonna melt,

13:16.580 --> 13:20.099
causing a tidal wave
to head right for the U.S.

13:20.134 --> 13:22.535
You're insane.
Yeah.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.737
The tidal wave should come
all the way to Detroit.

13:24.772 --> 13:26.239
That's what the sand's for.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.141
I'm gonna dump all
of it on my street

13:28.175 --> 13:29.575
and let the water
come right up to it.

13:29.610 --> 13:30.560
Bam!

13:30.594 --> 13:32.745
Beachfront property, y'all.

13:32.780 --> 13:34.330
Millions of people
will be killed.

13:34.365 --> 13:35.765
And I will weep
for those people

13:35.799 --> 13:37.834
as I drink my beer
that's in a paper bag

13:37.868 --> 13:40.303
because there won't be
open containers on my beach.

13:40.337 --> 13:42.939
Can't change all the laws.

13:42.973 --> 13:44.257
You'll never get
away with this.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.325
My partner's gonna come get me.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.794
And there he is.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.829
On cue!

13:49.863 --> 13:50.997
Tearjerker.
Same side!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.065
No, not this time.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.066
This time, it's
a double-cross.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.101
(laughing)

13:57.538 --> 13:59.238
I love old factories.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.424
You get the sense that
so much work was done here.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.009
We don't work
like that anymore.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.710
"Let the Asians do
the work," we say.

14:11.670 --> 14:12.618
What are you going to do to me?

14:12.738 --> 14:14.349
Well, first, I'm gonna do this.

14:14.589 --> 14:15.556
(belches loudly)

14:15.607 --> 14:16.359
Ugh!

14:16.479 --> 14:17.336
Yeah, Havarti.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.443
You got me back into it.
That's on you.

14:19.477 --> 14:22.012
Second, we're gonna
run you through this.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.817
Get me off this crazy thing!

14:26.851 --> 14:28.068
Where's Black Villain?

14:28.119 --> 14:29.536
You can't stop Black Villain.

14:29.571 --> 14:31.288
He's a criminal mastermind,

14:31.323 --> 14:33.824
who will carry out
his plan at any cost.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.478
Yeah, I just bought this
eight-dollar surge protector

14:37.512 --> 14:39.546
and I want to exchange it
for the six-dollar one.

14:39.581 --> 14:42.683
The six-dollar protector
is for preferred customers only.

14:42.717 --> 14:44.318
I am a preferred customer.

14:44.352 --> 14:46.253
You got a preferred
customer card?

14:46.288 --> 14:47.788
It's at home.

14:47.822 --> 14:50.391
I need it to get you
the preferred customer price.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.026
Can I use your customer card?

14:52.060 --> 14:54.762
I'm not very
comfortable with that.

14:54.796 --> 14:57.164
Come on, you still get
the purchaser points, man.

14:57.198 --> 14:59.817
I just want the discount.

14:59.851 --> 15:01.935
Oh, it's like that, huh?

15:05.407 --> 15:07.474
I hope they take
purchaser points...

15:07.509 --> 15:09.326
in hell!

15:18.219 --> 15:19.687
How could you do this to me?

15:19.721 --> 15:21.255
You used to be my wife!

15:21.289 --> 15:23.457
I don't even know who
the hell you are.

15:23.508 --> 15:26.126
Sexpun, I know you're
in there somewhere.

15:26.177 --> 15:27.744
Come on, don't you remember?

15:27.762 --> 15:29.413
We had a life together.

15:29.431 --> 15:31.048
That's insane.

15:31.082 --> 15:32.582
No, I'll prove it.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.052
Reach under my shirt and
look in my gentleman's locket.

15:39.424 --> 15:42.142
So I look like
some dead white girl.

15:42.193 --> 15:44.311
So does Madonna.
Who cares?

15:51.069 --> 15:54.738
I hope the ocean is as blue
as it is in my dreams.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.382
I don't see any fish.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.234
That's because you
talk too much!

16:10.588 --> 16:14.591
I can't believe I've come all
this way just to be defeated.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.427
Defeated.

16:16.461 --> 16:17.728
My feet!

16:18.980 --> 16:20.931
Suck on my feet.

16:20.965 --> 16:23.934
Not you, Tearjerker!

16:23.968 --> 16:25.269
Hell, no!

16:25.303 --> 16:27.571
I'm not sucking those
nasty-ass feet.

16:27.605 --> 16:29.823
Come on, you never
could resist these.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.742
You're out of your damn mind.

16:31.776 --> 16:33.410
Am I out of my mind...

16:33.445 --> 16:35.145
or out of my socks?

16:36.581 --> 16:38.132
Oh, yeah, that's better.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.167
â™ª

16:42.270 --> 16:43.971
You better...

16:44.005 --> 16:45.756
put those back.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.424
Well...

16:47.459 --> 16:49.426
you are about to die.

16:49.461 --> 16:50.794
That's right.

16:50.828 --> 16:53.430
This is your last chance to get
a taste of these piggies.

17:07.945 --> 17:09.946
Oh, my God.

17:09.981 --> 17:11.448
I remember it all.

17:11.483 --> 17:13.700
We had a life together!

17:13.734 --> 17:15.035
What? No.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.920
You're just repeating
what he said ten minutes ago.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.238
No, he's right.

17:18.272 --> 17:20.207
I'm Sexpun.

17:20.241 --> 17:23.327
I'm his wife.
We were in love.

17:23.361 --> 17:26.029
We are in love.

17:27.699 --> 17:29.433
That's not how cloning works.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.068
You're a completely
different person.

17:31.102 --> 17:32.402
You are so dumb!

17:32.437 --> 17:33.587
Yeah?

17:33.638 --> 17:35.839
Would a dumb person do this?

17:35.873 --> 17:36.857
Yes!

17:36.891 --> 17:39.193
I'm totally telling on you.

17:46.334 --> 17:48.402
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

17:48.436 --> 17:52.322
I'm here to pull the plug on
your plan, Black Villain.

17:52.357 --> 17:53.607
(whistles)

17:57.295 --> 18:00.230
You had to know I was gonna
use the cloning thing

18:00.265 --> 18:02.833
for something besides
turning a white girl black.

18:05.436 --> 18:06.770
Can you watch
where you're going?

18:06.804 --> 18:08.205
Can you go (bleep) yourself?

18:11.793 --> 18:13.810
(grunting)

18:33.031 --> 18:35.699
(gunshots, grunting)

18:40.638 --> 18:42.706
(laughing)

18:49.297 --> 18:51.698
Yes! It worked!

18:51.733 --> 18:53.750
I can't believe he did it.

18:54.686 --> 18:56.453
Good-bye, Stan Smith.

18:56.487 --> 18:58.956
Sexpunequa, you're so fine,

18:58.990 --> 19:00.757
I'm gonna give you
another chance.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.378
I'd rather die with him
than be with you.

19:04.412 --> 19:05.829
Doesn't matter.

19:05.863 --> 19:08.098
I've got like 40 more of you
in my daddy's garage.

19:08.132 --> 19:10.367
And they do way more
dirty stuff than you do.

19:10.401 --> 19:11.535
Oh, yeah.

19:11.569 --> 19:12.690
(helicopter blades whirring)

19:13.621 --> 19:15.639
Grab Tearjerker now!

19:27.552 --> 19:28.852
Turn it on, S!

19:37.495 --> 19:39.296
Oh, damn.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.365
No!

19:52.510 --> 19:55.145
Wait, why are we saving you?

19:55.179 --> 19:57.781
You betrayed us.
Aah!

19:57.815 --> 19:59.950
Ha!
I survived a volcano.

19:59.984 --> 20:02.152
You don't think
I can survive this?

20:05.089 --> 20:07.090
(waves crashing)

20:11.329 --> 20:12.646
Mmm...

20:12.680 --> 20:16.149
Smith, congratulations
on taking down Black Villain.

20:16.184 --> 20:18.719
Well, it was probably
my toughest assignment yet.

20:18.753 --> 20:20.370
I trust the president will be

20:20.388 --> 20:22.005
presenting me
with a medal of some sort.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.074
Actually, the president is dead,

20:24.108 --> 20:25.842
half the U.S. is underwater

20:25.877 --> 20:27.311
and millions have perished.

20:27.345 --> 20:31.898
So, maybe just enjoy that
beachfront cabin in Iowa, yes?

20:31.933 --> 20:34.534
Smith? Smith?
