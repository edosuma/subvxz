WEBVTT

00:06.060 --> 00:08.193
Ten months after getting out of prison,

00:08.195 --> 00:11.663
I'm still learning about all
the things I missed out on.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.056
I wish I'd had my kids
back in the good ol' days

00:16.081 --> 00:18.615
when being a dad was easier.

00:18.617 --> 00:20.919
You didn't have to go
to no birthday parties...

00:20.944 --> 00:22.877
you didn't have to do no hair...

00:22.902 --> 00:24.419
didn't have to help with no homework.

00:25.476 --> 00:27.396
Back then, all you had
to do was teach your son

00:27.426 --> 00:29.626
how to tie a tie for
the eventual funerals...

00:29.628 --> 00:32.762
and, your daughter, how
to keep her legs closed.

00:33.565 --> 00:36.365
Now I have to learn all
this social-media stuff

00:36.367 --> 00:38.435
just to communicate with my kids.

00:38.437 --> 00:41.771
The real reason is back then,
the expectations were lower.

00:41.773 --> 00:44.774
There was a lot less for
dads to do, which means...

00:44.776 --> 00:47.914
there was a lot less
for dads to miss out on.

00:49.906 --> 00:51.839
Okay, okay, I get it.

00:51.841 --> 00:53.240
You see a black man sitting here,

00:53.242 --> 00:55.310
so I must be selling
or stealing something.

00:55.312 --> 00:57.912
Well, you got the wrong dude,
Officer! 'Cause that ain't me!

00:57.914 --> 00:59.947
Actually, I see a grown man on a bench

00:59.972 --> 01:02.950
with a coat folded in his lap
taking pictures of little kids.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.775
Ho, ho. Okay.

01:05.077 --> 01:07.712
I see your point, and it's valid.

01:14.722 --> 01:17.112
Yo, Felony, I did not know you was

01:17.137 --> 01:20.404
in the medical profession
in addition to being a thief.

01:20.406 --> 01:23.207
I'm wearing scrubs 'cause I
was my girlfriend's labor coach.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.876
Oh. Did you cut the cord? It's so cool.

01:24.878 --> 01:26.344
I cut the cord on both of my kids.

01:26.346 --> 01:28.480
I did, and we delayed
clamping, of course.

01:28.482 --> 01:31.149
- Of course.
- What the hell is going on?!

01:31.151 --> 01:32.550
Ain't like the old days, Tray.

01:32.552 --> 01:34.886
These fathers go through
the whole process now. Ugh!

01:34.888 --> 01:36.389
I'll just add that to the list of things

01:36.413 --> 01:38.022
I missed out on with my kids.

01:38.024 --> 01:39.386
Man, I went from pre-natal care

01:39.411 --> 01:40.892
right up until the baby came out.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.752
I think you mean, "Until
the placenta came out."

01:42.776 --> 01:45.206
Alejandro, you gotta
be here at least a month

01:45.231 --> 01:47.646
before you earn the
right to drop knowledge.

01:47.671 --> 01:49.501
But I thought I was waiting a
month to use the bathroom already.

01:49.503 --> 01:51.503
- I don't make the rules, okay?
- Yeah, you did.

01:51.505 --> 01:53.705
Right before Alejandro
moved in, you said,

01:53.707 --> 01:55.239
"Let's break this fool."

01:55.241 --> 01:56.451
And it worked, man.

01:56.476 --> 01:59.074
What's goin' on, my
rehabilitated refugees?

01:59.099 --> 02:01.813
Cuzzo. I'm outside
mad-long. What's goin' on?

02:01.838 --> 02:04.706
Sorry, Bobby. My man Felony
just had a baby yesterday.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.575
- Congratulations! Natural birth?
- Yeah.

02:07.577 --> 02:10.089
Oh, that's a perfect round
head for the vaginal delivery.

02:10.114 --> 02:12.580
- That is excellent.
- You know how to deliver babies?

02:12.582 --> 02:15.143
You remember, uh, Koko,
my sister's best friend?

02:15.168 --> 02:16.518
- She had the uneven titties?
- Mm-hmm.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.873
Anyways, I wake up one
morning. I go to the kitchen.

02:18.898 --> 02:21.500
She in the middle of
labor, on the table, 'kay?

02:21.525 --> 02:23.992
You know what I'm saying? My
sister's gone. Mom's is at work.

02:23.994 --> 02:26.482
She used to work at, uh,
D'Agostino's off of Third.

02:26.507 --> 02:28.330
You know what I'm saying? You
know, that's not even there no more.

02:28.332 --> 02:29.931
It's an architectural firm.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.721
- It's, like, uh, "Logan and Burns Designs," 'kay?
- Bobby!

02:32.746 --> 02:33.802
Cut to the chase!

02:33.804 --> 02:35.384
Okay, okay. So, I get a cab, right?

02:35.409 --> 02:37.139
So, we're on the way to
Manhattan to see the doctor.

02:37.141 --> 02:40.587
Her contractions is goin'
crazy, and they 20 seconds apart.

02:40.612 --> 02:41.946
So I'm like, "Pull the cab over."

02:42.146 --> 02:44.812
And right there in the
back of the Yellow Cab,

02:44.814 --> 02:47.481
the baby was born on the side
of the Brooklyn Bridge, B.

02:47.483 --> 02:49.771
- So you delivered that baby?
- You know what? No, no.

02:49.796 --> 02:52.286
Luckily, the cabbie was an
obstetrician in, uh, BanGladesh.

02:52.288 --> 02:54.222
Check this out. This is
when I started filming

02:54.224 --> 02:55.714
when Julie was at 10 centimeters.

02:55.739 --> 02:57.127
Wow!

02:58.494 --> 02:59.960
Baby, I think it's wrong.

02:59.985 --> 03:01.738
The picture shows that
the holes are on top.

03:01.763 --> 03:03.083
Yeah, why are we even doing this?

03:04.079 --> 03:05.545
Have you not seen the house?

03:05.570 --> 03:07.637
There is nowhere to put any of our crap.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.172
All of our stuff is on the dining table.

03:10.174 --> 03:14.042
You got books, you got iPads,
you got, uh, cellphones.

03:14.044 --> 03:15.777
And we always gotta clear the table off

03:15.779 --> 03:17.155
before we can even eat a meal.

03:17.180 --> 03:20.782
And if I have take off
one more electronic gadget

03:20.917 --> 03:24.052
or if I trip over another cord,
you're gonna end up havin' to

03:24.054 --> 03:25.576
take me out of here in a straitjacket!

03:25.789 --> 03:30.192
I meant, why didn't we just
pay somebody to assemble it?

03:30.194 --> 03:32.460
- Oh. Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.176
- I-It's been a long week.
- Yeah, I know.

03:35.201 --> 03:39.071
Should be in bed binge-watching
some TV or just relaxing.

03:39.096 --> 03:41.229
You tryin' to have some afternoon sex?

03:41.838 --> 03:44.187
- Yes. Yeah.
- Oh, well, you should've just said that

03:44.219 --> 03:46.060
from the get-go, you know.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.001
- Ugh. Hold on.
- Really?

03:48.377 --> 03:50.791
Wait a minute. You stay right
there, 'cause I'm getting that.

03:51.346 --> 03:53.327
Shay.

03:54.218 --> 03:56.484
Please tell me you filmed
the kids being born.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.608
Josh, do those instructions
say, "Answer random-ass question

03:59.633 --> 04:01.623
from dude that doesn't
call before comin' over"?

04:01.625 --> 04:04.492
Uh, it's mostly just pictures. Uh...

04:04.494 --> 04:07.381
Josh, were you in the delivery room

04:07.406 --> 04:08.896
when the twins were being born?

04:08.898 --> 04:11.365
You know I didn't meet
the kids until they were 4.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.541
- What's up, Tray?
- The guys at the halfway house

04:13.566 --> 04:15.503
all got to see their kids being born.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.208
You know, they coached, they cut cords.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.500
Even Bobby coached a birth!

04:20.644 --> 04:22.893
Anyway, please tell me filmed it.

04:22.918 --> 04:24.521
I would love to see my kids being born,

04:24.546 --> 04:25.914
even if it's videotape.

04:25.939 --> 04:27.711
Yeah, I mean, one of my girlfriends

04:27.736 --> 04:29.117
was in the delivery room with a camera,

04:29.119 --> 04:30.639
but I don't know where the tape is at.

04:30.987 --> 04:33.255
Now, look here. We was in
the middle of something.

04:33.257 --> 04:35.457
- Can this wait?
- I waited 15 years.

04:35.459 --> 04:37.388
And I don't know what
that day is about...

04:37.992 --> 04:40.674
how much they weighed,
where they were born at,

04:40.699 --> 04:42.000
if it was caesarean.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.668
I don't even know which one of my kids

04:44.693 --> 04:47.335
pushed their way into
this crazy-ass world first!

04:47.337 --> 04:49.604
- Amira came out first.
- Of course she did.

04:49.606 --> 04:51.244
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Shay, please.

04:51.269 --> 04:52.807
No, man, I lost all of that.

04:54.410 --> 04:58.214
First birthday, first
holiday, first steps,

04:59.107 --> 05:00.258
first words...

05:02.729 --> 05:04.227
... first breath.

05:07.757 --> 05:09.835
Look, I can look down in the basement

05:09.860 --> 05:12.560
and see if it's in one
of those boxes down there.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.562
- Maybe the tape's in there.
- Wait.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.831
You got a videotape of the
kids' birth in the basement?

05:16.833 --> 05:18.432
I wanna see that. I've never seen that.

05:18.434 --> 05:21.152
I was howling like I was
transforming into a werewolf.

05:22.506 --> 05:24.473
It wasn't an easy time for me then.

05:27.777 --> 05:30.378
James told me not to bring
the kids this weekend.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.780
I was like, "What do you
think? I'm made of money?"

05:32.782 --> 05:34.516
My mother can't babysit them anymore,

05:34.518 --> 05:37.251
especially since he got just
locked up for the third time.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.387
Well, I brought extra
food in case the kids get hungry,

05:39.389 --> 05:41.589
and I got a whole sock full of
quarters for the vending machine.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.839
I remembered my quarters this week.

05:43.864 --> 05:45.798
And my pictures of the new baby.

05:45.823 --> 05:48.557
Made Gary some
peanut-butter cookies, too.

05:48.732 --> 05:51.933
If that asshole guard let
me bring 'em in this time.

05:55.339 --> 05:58.807
- First time on the bus?
- It's that obvious?

05:58.809 --> 06:01.343
- You goin' to visit family members?
- My boyfriend.

06:01.345 --> 06:04.012
He's in for attempted murder,
but he didn't do it, though.

06:04.014 --> 06:06.815
We got ourselves a good lawyer
this time, so he's appealing it.

06:06.817 --> 06:09.283
I just hope he's out in
time for Christmas this year.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.019
My boyfriend won't be.

06:11.021 --> 06:14.246
Listen, I'm-a tell you something
that I wish someone had told me

06:14.271 --> 06:15.757
the first time that
Caesar got locked up.

06:15.759 --> 06:18.026
Okay, you gonna have to
be on the phone a lot.

06:18.028 --> 06:20.829
You can buy him these phone
cards so he can call you collect.

06:20.831 --> 06:23.631
And then if he waits till after
midnight, it's a little cheaper.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.434
Also, me and Caesar, we write
to each other all the time.

06:26.436 --> 06:27.769
That's why I always carry this around.

06:27.771 --> 06:29.437
You see how the stamp is upside down?

06:29.439 --> 06:31.706
- Mm-hmm.
- That means "I love you."

06:31.708 --> 06:33.831
Can't he just say that in the letter?

06:33.856 --> 06:36.442
- What you mean?
- Never mind.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

06:49.956 --> 06:52.036
Is your dad on a time-out, too?

06:52.061 --> 06:53.131
What's that?

06:53.466 --> 06:56.861
Is your dad here 'cause he's
on a time-out like my daddy?

06:57.626 --> 07:00.427
Yeah. Time-out. That's right.

07:02.872 --> 07:04.206
Get your ID's out!

07:12.616 --> 07:14.283
What are you doing, crazy man?

07:14.285 --> 07:16.551
Tryin' to get this
good baby smell on me.

07:17.077 --> 07:20.278
Boy, that has been in a
box for the last 14 years.

07:20.303 --> 07:22.359
If anything, it smells like mothballs.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.961
I wonder who wore this
one. Amira or Shahzad?

07:26.525 --> 07:27.763
They both did.

07:27.765 --> 07:29.698
I was so overwhelmed
when they were little.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.495
It didn't matter to me. Boy or girl.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.000
As long as they were clean,
I was puttin' their clothes on 'em.

07:35.608 --> 07:37.984
This was the last box.

07:38.009 --> 07:40.075
You know, I moved around a lot, Tray.

07:40.077 --> 07:42.210
I'm sorry. It must've
got lost in the shuffle.

07:45.616 --> 07:47.278
Shay, where'd you get that elephant?!

07:47.693 --> 07:48.897
From the box. Why?

07:50.488 --> 07:52.357
I had the same exact one!

07:52.373 --> 07:55.617
Shahzad used to carry this around
with him everywhere. It was his.

07:55.841 --> 07:57.825
I used to carry mine's
around all the time, too.

07:57.850 --> 07:59.198
Yo, listen. When I was a kid,

07:59.739 --> 08:01.387
elephants was my jam.

08:01.736 --> 08:03.958
Especially after I learned
that they'll stomp their owners

08:03.982 --> 08:05.273
to death if they're mean to them.

08:05.297 --> 08:07.799
They don't forget.
And they got big dicks.

08:07.824 --> 08:12.035
Hmm, well, Shahzad like
"Dumbo," the Disney movie.

08:12.037 --> 08:14.371
I wonder what the twins
got in common with me.

08:14.373 --> 08:16.573
Ha. Way too much.

08:16.575 --> 08:18.709
Shahzad chewed just like you.

08:18.711 --> 08:21.768
Amira make that same face that
you make when you concentrate.

08:22.848 --> 08:24.998
- I'm concentrating.
- Mm-hmm.

08:25.023 --> 08:26.649
They used to drive me crazy.

08:26.651 --> 08:29.895
Oh, and they both loved
to grab at my boobs.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.055
And we know that's genetic.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.745
Well, that's 'cause we recognize
top-shelf boobs when we see them.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.660
- Shay.
- Hmm?

08:38.663 --> 08:40.304
It's all right. Thanks for trying.

08:42.934 --> 08:46.359
You know what? We got a
storage unit up in Queens.

08:46.384 --> 08:47.671
Maybe the tape's there.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.409
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Queens.

08:52.411 --> 08:54.803
It's a long subway ride,
and I'm going upstairs first

08:54.828 --> 08:57.147
to get some of them energy
bars you and Josh got.

08:57.149 --> 08:58.625
You know I got a car, right?

08:59.982 --> 09:02.619
Well, I'm-a still have the
energy bars. You coming?

09:02.621 --> 09:06.489
Today, we are going to the farm.

09:06.491 --> 09:08.691
Boy, it is nice to have some help.

09:08.693 --> 09:11.294
I don't know when the last time it was

09:11.296 --> 09:13.564
I sat down here and just relaxed.

09:13.566 --> 09:16.521
This whole VCR setup you got going

09:16.546 --> 09:19.102
is the life-saver, girl... not me.

09:19.104 --> 09:22.092
And lookit. You have baby videos.

09:22.117 --> 09:23.306
Are you crazy?

09:23.308 --> 09:25.422
Before you got here, I used
to have to take the twins

09:25.447 --> 09:27.446
with me to the bathroom
when I got ready for work.

09:27.471 --> 09:29.081
They seen me naked so times,

09:29.106 --> 09:31.114
I don't even think they
recognize me with clothes on.

09:31.116 --> 09:34.018
- Hey. I'm gonna go warm up their food... 
- Mom.

09:34.043 --> 09:36.319
... while they... What?

09:36.321 --> 09:37.940
I am so proud of you.

09:38.657 --> 09:42.926
Six months clean. You are doing so good.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.461
Thank you, baby.

09:44.463 --> 09:48.999
I'm just sorry I wasn't here
for you when they were born.

09:49.001 --> 09:50.401
Well, you're here now.

09:50.403 --> 09:52.968
And like I keep telling
you, I got a birth video

09:52.993 --> 09:55.447
we can sit down and watch together
so you can see what we missed.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.826
And I keep telling you,
"Hell naw." Mnh-mnh.

09:58.851 --> 10:01.308
Look. I haven't even
watched it by myself.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.813
I feel like it's weird.

10:02.815 --> 10:05.189
And watching it with
your mama feels right?

10:05.214 --> 10:06.801
- Yeah.
- Girl, I don't wanna see stuff

10:06.826 --> 10:08.293
coming out of your coochie!

10:08.393 --> 10:10.325
Don't get your hopes up.

10:10.327 --> 10:13.396
Just check anything that has "2002."

10:16.601 --> 10:19.793
Damn. These all the
letters I wrote you from prison?

10:19.818 --> 10:20.959
Yeah.

10:22.006 --> 10:23.538
They're still sealed.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.340
I wrote you dozens of
letters from prison,

10:25.342 --> 10:26.627
and you didn't read one?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.145
I was afraid, Tray.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.415
Afraid of what?

10:32.417 --> 10:36.423
I mean, you wouldn't
even tuck your chain in

10:36.448 --> 10:38.487
while we was ridin' the R train.

10:38.489 --> 10:40.755
But you were scared
to read them letters.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.757
I knew whatever you
wrote would piss me off

10:42.759 --> 10:45.428
or make me wanna try
to work things with you.

10:45.430 --> 10:48.670
And I couldn't afford
either one. I'm sorry.

10:49.434 --> 10:52.435
I had to be indifferent,
or I wouldn't have made it.

10:52.437 --> 10:54.103
Hmm. I get it.

10:54.105 --> 10:57.576
But damn. I poured my
heart out in those letters.

10:58.354 --> 11:01.131
Well, if it'll make you feel any better,
I can read one right now.

11:02.113 --> 11:03.354
It would.

11:04.690 --> 11:05.924
Okay.

11:08.052 --> 11:09.153
Let's see.

11:11.777 --> 11:12.922
N-No.

11:13.524 --> 11:16.858
I wrote this one asking you
to put some money on my books.

11:18.996 --> 11:20.992
No. No. Not this one.

11:21.017 --> 11:22.999
I wrote this one asking you to send me

11:23.024 --> 11:24.599
some nasty pictures of yourself.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.515
No.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.127
I wrote this one 'cause I was mad at you

11:29.151 --> 11:31.175
for not sending nasty
pictures of yourself.

11:32.810 --> 11:36.279
Oh, hell, no! This was
nasty pictures of me.

11:36.281 --> 11:38.681
- Who took those?
- Don't worry about it!

11:40.751 --> 11:42.417
No, no, no, no. Let's find one.

11:42.419 --> 11:44.820
Let me see if I can find
one in here that's good.

11:44.822 --> 11:46.258
This is a good one right here.

11:48.616 --> 11:49.882
This is a letter...

11:49.907 --> 11:51.976
the happiest day of my life in prison.

11:54.098 --> 11:55.898
The day I got my G.E.D.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.367
I didn't know you got
your high-school diploma.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.957
And look at you, Tray.

12:00.268 --> 12:01.879
I don't know what I
was so damn excited for.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.839
I had eleven more years to go, man.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.834
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.239
What, I was gonna ask for
a raise at my kitchen job?

12:09.271 --> 12:12.515
You know, enroll in college
and defer it for 12 more years?

12:12.517 --> 12:14.944
Well, maybe it was good
to break up the monotony.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.484
Hm. I didn't do it
for that, though, Shay.

12:18.333 --> 12:21.765
I was planning on gettin'
out and taking care of you.

12:22.459 --> 12:23.614
Now the kids are here.

12:24.274 --> 12:26.605
I'm even more motivated
to get myself together.

12:26.630 --> 12:30.173
And when I do that, baby,
that's when I'll be proud.

12:33.471 --> 12:36.316
- Ah! There it is! I found it!
- Whoa!

12:36.341 --> 12:39.141
I was gonna make you
reenact the delivery for me.

12:39.143 --> 12:41.158
But now all we got to do is get a VCR,

12:41.183 --> 12:42.866
go to your house, and
watch this with Josh.

12:43.302 --> 12:44.747
I don't have a VCR.

12:44.749 --> 12:48.551
You mean to tell me you got a pinstripe
polka-dot pantsuit from 1982,

12:48.553 --> 12:50.605
but you threw out the
machine that plays this?

12:51.088 --> 12:52.651
No. I didn't throw it out.

12:53.016 --> 12:54.823
- _
- SHAY: Mama, tell me the truth.

12:54.825 --> 12:57.960
You sold my goddamn TV
so you could buy drugs!

12:57.962 --> 13:02.164
Don't you cuss around me.
I can still slap your...

13:02.166 --> 13:06.262
You are high on crack, and
you stole your daughter's TV!

13:07.008 --> 13:08.488
And you're talkin' about me cussin'?!

13:09.075 --> 13:10.963
You need to get help.

13:11.642 --> 13:12.654
Hmm.

13:14.384 --> 13:15.432
Fuck.

13:15.457 --> 13:17.060
Wait a... Wait a minute.

13:18.489 --> 13:19.949
Where's the money that was in here?

13:19.974 --> 13:21.504
Ohh! How should I know?

13:22.053 --> 13:24.526
There was $200 in here yesterday, Mama.

13:25.656 --> 13:28.123
How dare you accuse me!

13:28.125 --> 13:29.629
That was my grocery money.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.220
How am I supposed to feed my kids?!

13:33.064 --> 13:35.264
Get out. Get out of my house!

13:35.266 --> 13:37.466
What you mean, get out of your house?

13:37.468 --> 13:39.434
- Yep.
- Girl, you ain't shit!

13:39.815 --> 13:42.405
- You gonna put me out?!
- Get out of my house!

13:42.407 --> 13:45.140
Oh, please. I ain't thinkin' 'bout you!

13:45.142 --> 13:46.809
Get the fuck out!

14:08.299 --> 14:12.034
Ohh. My babies. My babies.

14:15.572 --> 14:18.707
Yeah. Yeah.

14:24.048 --> 14:26.515
Shh. Shhh.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.828
We come too far, and I got to
watch this video tape tonight!

14:31.853 --> 14:33.368
But we don't have a VCR.

14:33.772 --> 14:36.631
Hmm. I think I know somebody who might.

14:36.656 --> 14:39.705
Seriously? What kind of cheapskate
hoarder would still have a VCR?

14:39.730 --> 14:41.642
The kind that runs a halfway house.

14:44.001 --> 14:46.535
I thought you was
exaggerating when you said

14:46.537 --> 14:48.537
this Mullins character was cheap.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.406
This looks like a high-school
production of "Good Times."

14:51.408 --> 14:55.327
Shh. Keep it down. I'm supposed
to get permission ahead of time

14:55.352 --> 14:58.017
before I bring anybody in
here of the female persuasion.

14:58.042 --> 15:00.442
- You mean women?
- Ain't nobody said nothin' about no woman.

15:02.179 --> 15:05.108
I said "female."

15:05.965 --> 15:07.133
When I first got here,

15:07.158 --> 15:10.132
he confiscated a bearded
dragon from Big Country

15:10.157 --> 15:11.694
when he found out it was a she.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.838
- Mm-hmm.
- Took it down to his private quarters

15:13.863 --> 15:17.066
in the basement, none
of us ever saw it again.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.235
God damn it. I would hate to think

15:19.260 --> 15:20.903
of what happened to little Tatiana.

15:20.905 --> 15:22.705
I liked that bearded dragon.

15:22.707 --> 15:24.419
I bet you she killed herself,

15:24.808 --> 15:26.568
'cause I would hate to live here.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.125
I hate everything about
here, to be honest.

15:28.149 --> 15:30.696
Well, you try living
here. Check it out, yo.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.321
There you go. There you go right there.

15:36.988 --> 15:39.522
This is the second childbirth
video I've seen today.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.791
Huh?

15:43.528 --> 15:47.596
Come on, girl! Come on.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.598
Who's that talking? Who filmed this?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.600
My old friend Lisa Johnson.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.602
Ratchet-ass Lisa Johnson?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.057
Turtle from the projects?

15:55.082 --> 15:58.407
- Lisa is not ratchet.
- Pop it out like a ping-pong ball!

15:58.409 --> 15:59.742
Pop it, pop it, pop, enh!

15:59.767 --> 16:01.612
Okay, maybe you should
mute it right here.

16:01.637 --> 16:04.146
- Yup.
- It's not... Nothing happenin' for a minute.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.431
You still keep in contact with Turtle?

16:08.056 --> 16:09.376
Are you serious?

16:09.820 --> 16:12.146
I lost all my friends
after the kids were born.

16:12.646 --> 16:14.249
Single moms just have to survive.

16:14.759 --> 16:17.193
No time for fun or socializing.

16:17.672 --> 16:21.407
I mean, for years, my idea
of fun was taking a bath

16:21.432 --> 16:23.917
or going to the laundromat alone.

16:25.102 --> 16:26.625
Can I ask you something else, Shay?

16:27.905 --> 16:30.109
Why'd you save my letters if
you wasn't gonna read them?

16:33.310 --> 16:34.396
I don't know.

16:38.783 --> 16:41.480
I am so sorry for missing
the interview earlier.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.718
Thank you so much for
squeezing me in, Ms. Koch.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.921
Not a problem. Please call me Julie.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.857
Okay. Well, clothing is my passion.

16:48.859 --> 16:50.593
This is my favorite store.

16:50.595 --> 16:52.692
It would be a dream come
true to be able to work...

16:52.717 --> 16:56.065
C-Can you excuse me just
one moment? Just a second.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.066
My babysitter said she was sick again.

16:58.068 --> 17:00.001
Might be time for me to get a new one.

17:00.026 --> 17:01.032
Here you go.

17:01.057 --> 17:03.438
- Single mom?
- Yeah.

17:04.409 --> 17:05.472
Me too.

17:06.710 --> 17:09.144
You look amazing for
having two toddlers.

17:09.146 --> 17:10.945
I was such a wreck
when mine were that age.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.942
- Thank you so much for saying that, Julie.
- Mm-hmm.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.817
I actually made this dress myself.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.824
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kidding.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.242
Here. Try this with that printed blouse.

17:20.268 --> 17:21.505
And it's a great length for you, too.

17:21.529 --> 17:23.025
Ooh, this is perfect.

17:23.027 --> 17:25.961
I usually don't like what
salespeople pick out for me,

17:25.963 --> 17:27.630
but you have a great eye.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.298
You should go into fashion.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.354
You know, I've thought about
that, but I'm a single mom,

17:31.378 --> 17:33.168
and those fashion programs
are so expensive...

17:33.170 --> 17:35.838
Yeah, I'm still paying
off student loans.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.313
Hmm. If I had parents

17:37.338 --> 17:39.250
that could help out,
maybe I would, but...

17:39.275 --> 17:40.843
Oh, your parents not around?

17:40.845 --> 17:43.446
Well, my mom is, but she's an addict.

17:43.448 --> 17:45.314
Crack. It's horrible.

17:45.316 --> 17:48.083
And then the father of my
children, he's in prison,

17:48.108 --> 17:49.918
and that's because he was selling crack.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.253
And then you... You know what?

17:51.255 --> 17:53.377
Um, how 'bout I go ahead and just set up

17:53.402 --> 17:56.187
a fitting room for you,
and you can try this on?

17:56.212 --> 17:57.402
It's gonna look great on you.

17:59.730 --> 18:05.067
I forgot how disgusting
and primal childbirth is.

18:05.069 --> 18:08.471
This is some serious
"Wild Kingdom" type shit.

18:08.473 --> 18:10.505
It's like me right there

18:11.052 --> 18:13.942
is the same thing as a female gazelle.

18:13.944 --> 18:16.153
I was gonna say a Tasmanian devil.

18:16.814 --> 18:18.174
But I'll tell you what.

18:18.621 --> 18:20.881
Your stretched-out va-jay-jay
look way better than

18:20.906 --> 18:22.885
Felony's girl's
stretched-out va-jay-jay.

18:22.887 --> 18:25.105
Worst compliment I've ever gotten.

18:27.091 --> 18:28.727
That's my daughter's head right there.

18:28.752 --> 18:32.961
Yeah, she's crowning. Oh, no. Mnh-mnh.

18:32.963 --> 18:35.030
- Is that a piece of... 
- Yeah.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.172
I pooped on the table right there.

18:37.370 --> 18:39.234
Are you sure you wanna
continue to watch this?

18:39.259 --> 18:41.103
Hell yeah! That's my daughter's head.

18:41.105 --> 18:43.372
I wanna watch every second of this!

18:43.374 --> 18:45.430
Mnh-mnh-mnh. Un-mute it.
I wanna hear this part.

18:46.177 --> 18:48.711
Okay. Had a little accident.

18:49.049 --> 18:50.787
We're just gonna wait
till they clean that up.

18:50.811 --> 18:53.648
But don't worry. Twin Number
One will be making his debut.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.651
Aaah! My pussy's tearing!

18:56.676 --> 18:58.587
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.923
Look. That's baby Amira.

19:00.925 --> 19:03.532
That's my daughter. My princess.

19:03.557 --> 19:05.175
Aw, don't get me to crying, Tray.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.863
Don't cry. You're gonna make me cry now.

19:07.865 --> 19:09.755
Shay, that's our baby right there.

19:10.541 --> 19:11.571
I know.

19:12.229 --> 19:14.738
I can't believe you did
all that by yourself, Shay.

19:16.006 --> 19:17.272
You're so strong.

19:17.608 --> 19:19.151
A goddamn queen, my dear.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.244
I'm sorry that I put you in a position

19:22.278 --> 19:23.636
where you had to be so strong.

19:24.549 --> 19:26.840
I owe Josh. He stepped in.

19:27.435 --> 19:31.220
He protected you... and the kids.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.390
I could never repay him for that.

19:34.804 --> 19:35.898
No, I can't.

19:36.627 --> 19:37.708
Thank you, Tray.

19:38.295 --> 19:40.255
Aw, Shay, come on. Of course.

19:40.631 --> 19:41.755
Now, be honest.

19:42.233 --> 19:45.634
Did it turn you off when
you saw me poop on the table?

19:47.379 --> 19:49.641
Let's say the poop didn't help, okay?

19:50.666 --> 19:52.867
Oh. That's Shahzad.

19:53.044 --> 19:55.177
Well, they're twins. Yeah.

19:55.179 --> 19:57.235
If you would've told me
you had him a week later,

19:57.260 --> 19:58.381
I would've believed you.

19:58.383 --> 19:59.983
I don't know nothin' about this stuff.

20:00.457 --> 20:02.150
You're a damn idiot.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.642
- He's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

20:05.404 --> 20:06.771
