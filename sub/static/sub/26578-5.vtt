<i>Bike helmets hadn't been

00:12.941 --> 00:14.908
<i>And my mom was busy running the house.</i>

<i>She had a lot on her plate
and no time for tomfoolery...</i>

00:18.213 --> 00:19.212

00:19.314 --> 00:20.614
<i>There were eight of us boys,</i>

<i>including my oldest brother,
just home from college.</i>

00:23.352 --> 00:25.919

00:49.344 --> 00:52.145

Good show, Bobby.

Eat me, Understudy.

00:54.683 --> 00:57.384
- Good show, Bobby.
- You're never playing my part!

00:57.452 --> 01:00.253
Good show, Bobby.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.760
Only a few more performances.

01:06.828 --> 01:08.395
You think Dad will come see my show?

01:08.497 --> 01:09.663
We're doing a special thing this weekend

01:09.731 --> 01:10.764
where you get to meet the cast.

01:10.866 --> 01:12.899
Don't be silly.
Your father is far too busy.

01:15.604 --> 01:18.071
Doing what, keeping the couch
from floating away?

01:18.173 --> 01:20.874
Relax. Like I want your hair
in my potatoes.

01:22.177 --> 01:24.310
Hey, I went to your show,
which counts for both of us...

01:24.413 --> 01:25.845
just like parent-teacher conferences,

01:25.947 --> 01:27.247
or when the baby was born.

01:27.315 --> 01:28.982
He's not missing much.
You only have one line.

01:29.051 --> 01:30.850
<i>Actually, I had zero lines.</i>

01:30.919 --> 01:32.352
<i>But the night my mom came,</i>

01:32.421 --> 01:34.220
<i>I improvised something
just to get on stage.</i>

01:34.322 --> 01:35.622
It's not a giant!

01:35.724 --> 01:37.424
It's a windmill!

01:37.492 --> 01:39.392
<i>It kind of ruined a plot point.</i>

01:39.461 --> 01:41.027
<i>It wasn't just about the play.</i>

01:41.096 --> 01:43.163
<i>I-I wanted some acknowledgement
from the old man.</i>

01:43.265 --> 01:44.764
Is this your card?

01:45.901 --> 01:48.334
They're all my cards. I bought them.

01:48.437 --> 01:50.070
<i>We were such different people.</i>

01:50.138 --> 01:52.338
<i>He was confused
by my showbiz aspirations,</i>

01:52.407 --> 01:54.974
<i>but to be fair, I didn't
much get his life, either.</i>

01:55.043 --> 01:57.777
<i>He had no hobbies,
other than turning off lights.</i>

01:57.846 --> 02:00.246
Someone around here
must own stock in the DWP.

02:01.583 --> 02:04.884
And I am not air conditioning
the whole neighborhood!

02:06.054 --> 02:07.454
We don't have air conditioning.

02:07.556 --> 02:09.823
Then I'm right.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.357
<i>As far as I could tell, his only friend</i>

02:11.426 --> 02:12.959
<i>was our parish priest,
who he was helping</i>

02:13.028 --> 02:14.594
<i>run the annual boxing tournament...</i>

02:14.696 --> 02:17.263
<i>to "keep kids off the street
and safe from violence."</i>

02:17.332 --> 02:18.732
Oh!

02:18.800 --> 02:22.102
Matarucci looks tough,
but he's got a glass jaw.

02:22.204 --> 02:24.904
<i>In 1972, it was considered
wholesome exercise</i>

02:25.006 --> 02:26.806
<i>for children to beat the crap

02:32.147 --> 02:33.580
I have an announcement.

02:33.682 --> 02:34.681
Why would anyone care?

02:34.783 --> 02:35.882
Joey brings up a good point.

02:35.984 --> 02:37.183
Guys, let him talk.

02:37.285 --> 02:39.319
Maybe he finally realized
he has a weird face.

02:40.422 --> 02:41.988
I found a hair in my potatoes!

02:42.090 --> 02:43.556
It's your brother's fault
for mouthing off.

02:43.658 --> 02:45.492
I decided I'm competing this year

02:45.594 --> 02:47.660
in the church boxing tournament.

02:47.763 --> 02:49.229
Well, well.

02:49.331 --> 02:50.663
Sounds like all that brawling with Eddie

02:50.766 --> 02:51.931
may have finally taught you something.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.933
Yeah. How to bleed.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.869
Here, you can have Eddie's pork chop.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.403
You need the extra protein.

02:57.506 --> 02:59.539
<i>Frank's sudden interest in boxing</i>

02:59.641 --> 03:01.641
<i>was such an obvious and pathetic play</i>

03:01.743 --> 03:02.976
<i>for Dad's affections.</i>

03:03.078 --> 03:04.521
<i>Why didn't I think of it?</i>

03:04.568 --> 03:06.368
Go ahead.

03:06.470 --> 03:07.469
Give it your best.

03:10.674 --> 03:13.775
I'd say the decision
goes to the sleeping bag.

03:13.877 --> 03:15.844
Plant your feet. Try it again.

03:17.729 --> 03:20.735
Buddy, I get you.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.727
The world isn't up to your standards.

03:22.805 --> 03:24.886
You walk around like a clenched fist.

03:24.918 --> 03:26.918
Here's your chance to let all that out.

03:26.972 --> 03:29.569
You see Roy Rogers here?

03:29.671 --> 03:31.204
Make Trigger a widow.

03:32.607 --> 03:34.140
Yeah, much better!

03:34.239 --> 03:35.141
Again.

03:35.243 --> 03:36.276
Better!

03:36.378 --> 03:38.311
Okay! All right,
let's try a combination.

03:38.413 --> 03:40.513
Indian, cowboy, horse.

03:40.615 --> 03:42.916
Indian, cowboy, horse!

03:43.018 --> 03:44.150
Indian, cowboy, horse.

03:44.252 --> 03:45.285
Okay, easy.

03:45.387 --> 03:47.520
See how Dad's holding that bag
for Frank?

03:47.622 --> 03:50.156
That's the closest he'll ever
get to hugging one of us.

03:50.258 --> 03:52.125
Well, Dad's not super affectionate.

03:52.227 --> 03:53.192
But he'll spend time with you

03:53.295 --> 03:55.895
if you're willing to risk brain damage.

03:55.997 --> 03:57.697
I don't need to be smart.

03:57.799 --> 03:59.265
I want to be an actor.

04:07.108 --> 04:08.641
You out with Wendi again tonight?

04:08.743 --> 04:09.809
Shh.

04:09.911 --> 04:11.277
Quiet.

04:11.379 --> 04:12.946
I don't need another lecture from Mom.

04:13.048 --> 04:15.515
She already leaves VD pamphlets
in my underwear drawer.

04:15.617 --> 04:17.317
Because penicillin is expensive!

04:17.418 --> 04:18.785
Get to bed!

04:20.988 --> 04:22.255
You never learn, bro.

04:22.357 --> 04:23.556
If you're trying to sneak in,

04:23.658 --> 04:25.692
don't use the front door
by their bedroom.

04:25.794 --> 04:27.193
Go in the back door or a window.

04:27.295 --> 04:28.828
I normally go around back.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.297
But that angry possum
has been hanging around.

04:31.399 --> 04:32.599
Hey, what'd you and Wendi do tonight?

04:32.701 --> 04:35.068
I am not one to kiss and tell.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.769
Or more specifically,

04:36.871 --> 04:38.504
second base under the shirt and tell.

04:38.607 --> 04:39.439
Classy.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.673
Uh, I meant before that.

04:40.775 --> 04:42.108
The... The dinner or whatever.

04:42.210 --> 04:44.043
Dinner isn't the part
I usually brag about

04:44.145 --> 04:45.678
with my buddies.

04:45.780 --> 04:46.713
What's up?

04:46.781 --> 04:47.947
You want some pointers?

04:48.049 --> 04:49.248
From you?

04:49.351 --> 04:50.383
Doubt it.

04:50.452 --> 04:51.851
I've got all of this to work with.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.620
Well, if you're gonna work
with it again tonight,

04:53.688 --> 04:55.688
please wait till I'm asleep.

04:57.192 --> 04:58.391
What's poppin', gents?

04:58.493 --> 05:00.259
See? Joey knows to use the window.

05:00.362 --> 05:02.061
Where are you coming from?

05:02.163 --> 05:04.197
I think you'll want deniability on that.

05:04.265 --> 05:06.432
As you were.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.334
What's up with all
the dating questions, anyway?

05:08.403 --> 05:09.802
You've never had trouble with girls.

05:09.871 --> 05:12.438
After two years in the seminary,
I might be a little rusty.

05:12.507 --> 05:14.107
Plus, you obviously know a few tricks

05:14.175 --> 05:16.876
since you have somehow managed
to keep Wendi interested.

05:16.945 --> 05:18.244
Do you want my help or not?

05:18.346 --> 05:20.346
Okay, I'm seeing someone on Saturday,

05:20.448 --> 05:21.814
and with this girl...

05:21.883 --> 05:23.383
I just want it to go perfect.

05:23.451 --> 05:25.451
I got to two words for you...

05:25.520 --> 05:26.819
"Dry run."

05:26.888 --> 05:28.021
I'll sometimes take a buddy

05:28.123 --> 05:29.756
and do a dry run of a whole date,

05:29.858 --> 05:31.324
earlier the same day.

05:31.426 --> 05:33.526
Yeah, maybe I'll get some advice
from Joey.

05:33.595 --> 05:35.561
I'm telling you, it works.

05:35.630 --> 05:38.031
I go to the same movie,
the same restaurant,

05:38.099 --> 05:40.700
figure out what to order,
funny stuff to say...

05:40.802 --> 05:43.436
carefully planning out
all the spontaneity.

05:43.505 --> 05:45.672
So you think maybe
the two of us could, you know,

05:45.740 --> 05:47.006
do this thing on Saturday?

05:47.075 --> 05:48.107
"Do this thing"? Really?

05:48.209 --> 05:50.610
That's how you ask a person out?

05:50.712 --> 05:52.845
I see we've got our work cut out for us.

05:52.914 --> 05:54.547
The Lord likes a good, clean fight,

05:54.616 --> 05:56.182
but not a boring one.

05:56.251 --> 05:57.250
Mix it up!

05:58.853 --> 06:00.420
Okay. Come on!

06:00.522 --> 06:01.954
Indian, cowboy, horse...

06:02.057 --> 06:03.756
Indian, cowboy, horse...

06:03.858 --> 06:05.458
Why is he here?

06:05.527 --> 06:07.660
And why is he wearing
my maternity underwear?

06:07.729 --> 06:09.495
I don't even ask with that kid anymore.

06:09.597 --> 06:11.230
Oh, hey!

06:11.299 --> 06:12.799
I didn't expect to see you guys here.

06:12.901 --> 06:14.634
Don't horn in on Frank's thing.

06:14.736 --> 06:16.135
This is his way
of trying to be interesting.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.336
He needs it more than you.

06:22.911 --> 06:24.210
Ouch!

06:25.680 --> 06:27.280
Ah! In the face? Seriously?

06:27.382 --> 06:29.482
Come on, come on! Use your reach!

06:30.819 --> 06:32.552
If he gets his nose bashed in,
we're not fixing it.

06:32.654 --> 06:34.353
I need a new hot water heater.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.725
Dad, Dad, throw in my towel!

06:38.827 --> 06:39.992
Aah!

06:40.095 --> 06:41.194
Dad, throw in my towel!

06:41.296 --> 06:42.829
If you're serious about wanting
to do this,

06:42.931 --> 06:44.764
- I'll train you.
- Yes, I am!

06:46.134 --> 06:48.501
Oh, right in the cowboy.

06:48.603 --> 06:50.269
<i>And just like that...</i>

06:50.371 --> 06:52.071
Tonight, Timmy gets your pork chop.

06:52.173 --> 06:54.798
<i>...Frank's defeat became my victory.</i>

06:55.361 --> 06:57.525
All right, let's see what you got.

06:59.882 --> 07:01.515
Okay, stop. Stop!

07:01.617 --> 07:02.804
You look like your Aunt Marge

07:02.859 --> 07:04.759
waving flies away from a casserole.

07:04.828 --> 07:06.094
You want to be a little more
like Aunt Marge

07:06.162 --> 07:07.695
when she's beating the crap
out of Uncle Walter.

07:07.764 --> 07:08.830
Okay?

07:11.167 --> 07:12.233
Wow.

07:12.302 --> 07:13.902
Yeah. Come on.

07:16.873 --> 07:18.606
All right, now bounce
on the balls of your feet.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.074
Come on. Balls of your feet, light.

07:22.545 --> 07:24.245
Yeah, that's better.

07:25.548 --> 07:26.714
You're a natural.

07:26.783 --> 07:28.383
I'm a pretty quick study
with choreography.

07:28.485 --> 07:31.552
Don't. It's called "footwork." Okay?

07:31.621 --> 07:34.188
<i>To me, boxing was as much
Gene Kelly as Gene Tunney.</i>

07:34.257 --> 07:36.491
<i>In fact, I quickly realized...</i>

07:36.559 --> 07:39.193
<i>that boxing is just another
form of show business.</i>

07:40.430 --> 07:43.097
<i>A stage, a crowd, a spotlight...</i>

07:43.166 --> 07:44.766
<i>and a star!</i>

<i>It wasn't just musical theater
helping me in the ring.</i>

08:06.990 --> 08:10.091
<i>My large, loving family had
taught me to take a punch.</i>

08:12.395 --> 08:13.494
<i>Yep, even my mom.</i>

08:13.563 --> 08:14.696
<i>Remember, this was the '70s,</i>

08:14.764 --> 08:15.897
<i>so don't feel weird about any of this.</i>

08:18.101 --> 08:19.934
Come on.

08:20.003 --> 08:20.969
Oh!

08:21.037 --> 08:22.203
Yes!

08:22.305 --> 08:24.272
<i>And while I felt bad for my opponents...</i>

08:25.942 --> 08:28.576
<i>my dad was excited about me,</i>

08:28.645 --> 08:32.046
<i>about something I was doing
for the first time ever.</i>

08:32.115 --> 08:34.782
<i>Who says violence never solved anything?</i>

08:34.884 --> 08:37.150
I'm not saying I didn't like the movie,

08:37.253 --> 08:38.686
- it's just...
- You just didn't understand it.

08:38.788 --> 08:39.721
You didn't understand it, either.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.788
The whole thing was in Swedish.

08:40.857 --> 08:42.190
Nobody wants to read a movie.

08:42.292 --> 08:43.924
That's why they turn books into them.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.927
You should take her to see
"The Poseidon Adventure."

08:46.029 --> 08:47.729
Yeah, but I already
worked out jokes for this movie

08:47.797 --> 08:48.896
to whisper during lulls.

08:48.965 --> 08:49.998
The whole thing was lulls.

08:50.066 --> 08:52.433
When the minister lays dying,
I'm gonna say,

08:52.535 --> 08:55.470
"Good thing the Swedes
have socialized medicine."

08:55.538 --> 08:57.872
That joke will be just as funny
at "The Poseidon Adventure."

08:57.941 --> 08:59.974
And much more fun. No heavy message.

09:00.043 --> 09:01.175
No message?

09:01.277 --> 09:02.210
An upside-down ocean liner

09:02.278 --> 09:03.745
with everyone stripped of social class,

09:03.847 --> 09:04.879
and the wealthy have to work

09:04.948 --> 09:07.315
their way through steerage
to find salvation?

09:07.384 --> 09:08.416
I must have missed that part

09:08.518 --> 09:10.118
while I was making out with Wendi.

09:10.186 --> 09:12.387
Also, I don't think this is the
best place to take her after.

09:12.455 --> 09:14.322
It's a 1950s theme. The good old days.

09:14.424 --> 09:15.556
Oh, the good old days, when black people

09:15.625 --> 09:16.591
had separate water fountains

09:16.659 --> 09:18.092
and women were second-class citizens?

09:18.161 --> 09:19.761
I don't think that's
what they're going for.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.063
Oh, Samantha.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.132
Can I ask you something
as an Afro-American?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.333
Is it about the specials?

09:25.402 --> 09:27.602
Because otherwise,
I have four tables working.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.137
Well, she wouldn't have
felt comfortable doing that

09:29.239 --> 09:31.472
in the real 1950s.

09:31.574 --> 09:32.840
Right on, Samantha.

09:36.679 --> 09:38.346
That was good. You get any stronger,

09:38.448 --> 09:39.580
your brothers will be scared of you.

09:39.649 --> 09:40.548
Maybe your mom.

09:40.617 --> 09:41.382
Really?

09:41.484 --> 09:42.717
Nope!

09:42.819 --> 09:44.552
Your mom is terrifying.

09:44.621 --> 09:46.821
When the doctor told her
that Andy was gonna be

09:46.923 --> 09:50.291
two weeks late,
she stared him down so hard,

09:50.360 --> 09:52.894
he said, "Or whenever's good for you."

09:54.030 --> 09:56.030
She gave birth on the spot.

09:56.132 --> 09:57.432
You know, when I was your age...

09:58.468 --> 10:00.068
I was kind of a scrawny kid.

10:00.136 --> 10:01.669
Smaller than you,
smaller than Pat, even.

10:01.771 --> 10:02.970
That can't be true.

10:03.039 --> 10:06.140
Okay, not Pat... that's a medical thing.

10:06.209 --> 10:09.410
But I was kind of a small kid
and a bit of a scaredy cat.

10:09.479 --> 10:10.978
That definitely can't be true.

10:11.081 --> 10:11.879
I swear.

10:11.948 --> 10:13.281
That's what got me into boxing.

10:13.349 --> 10:15.349
And learning how
to handle myself in the ring

10:15.418 --> 10:18.352
made me feel less afraid.

10:18.421 --> 10:19.587
Big part of what got me through the war.

10:22.725 --> 10:23.724
Anyone need anything?

10:23.827 --> 10:25.526
Water, Kool-Aid, sandwiches?

10:25.628 --> 10:26.794
We're good.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.698
Then Dad turned to me
and shook his head like,

10:30.767 --> 10:32.934
"Guys like Frank will never understand

10:33.002 --> 10:34.969
men like you and me, Timmy."

10:35.038 --> 10:36.471
It was awesome!

10:36.539 --> 10:38.139
That's great, man. Cheers.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.274
This new relationship with Dad
has me so happy,

10:40.376 --> 10:41.876
it's like I won a Tony!

10:41.978 --> 10:44.412
Personally, I like to keep
the man at arm's length.

10:44.481 --> 10:46.414
He does his thing, I do mine.

10:46.516 --> 10:48.082
That way, no tears
when things get bumpy.

10:48.151 --> 10:49.784
You're missing out.

10:49.886 --> 10:51.819
Dad can be pretty cool.

10:51.921 --> 10:53.688
Oh, this is great.

10:53.790 --> 10:55.256
Feels good on my shoulder.

10:55.325 --> 10:56.891
You'll have to thank
the Munchiks for me.

10:56.993 --> 10:58.626
The Munchiks are currently enjoying

10:58.728 --> 11:00.461
the scenic beauty of Yellowstone.

11:00.530 --> 11:03.397
As far as they know, no one's
been using their hot tub.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.900
Or driving their GTO.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.103
Ohhh, I got a jet hammering
one of my sweet spots.

11:09.205 --> 11:12.006
"Good night, John Boy!"

11:12.075 --> 11:15.676
My advice... just try and keep
the conversation light.

11:15.745 --> 11:18.479
Everything shouldn't be
about capitalism and oppression.

11:18.548 --> 11:20.381
I dream of that utopia, too, brother,

11:20.450 --> 11:22.049
but we're only gonna get there
by talking about it.

11:22.118 --> 11:24.986
Boring. It's like going on a
date with Huntley and Brinkley.

11:25.054 --> 11:27.421
You know, women don't mind
substantive conversation,

11:27.490 --> 11:29.357
but I understand if it's not your thing.

11:29.459 --> 11:30.658
And there it is again.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.226
- What?
- "What?"

11:32.328 --> 11:34.362
You talking down to me
like you always do.

11:34.430 --> 11:35.763
You just called me boring.

11:35.832 --> 11:37.665
You've been laying
this condescension trip on me

11:37.767 --> 11:39.066
all day, and all my life,

11:39.169 --> 11:41.102
like you're so insightful
and I'm so dumb.

11:41.204 --> 11:42.303
I would never say you're dumb.

11:42.405 --> 11:43.938
You're just not that into being smart.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.540
You're the one who came crawling to me.

11:45.608 --> 11:47.275
I'm not a little kid anymore, Lawrence.

11:47.343 --> 11:49.210
I'm 18, I have a girlfriend,

11:49.312 --> 11:50.778
and my buddy Dino used my advice

11:50.847 --> 11:52.880
and got to third base with
the night manager at Shakey's.

11:52.982 --> 11:54.415
And she gave us free pizza.

11:54.484 --> 11:57.418
So someone is doing something right.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.886
I'll find my own way home.

12:01.691 --> 12:03.658
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

12:03.760 --> 12:06.127
but I feel certain the two of you

12:06.229 --> 12:08.729
can work out your problems.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.064
Thanks, ma'am.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.733
And a bit of advice...

12:12.802 --> 12:16.404
A pretty girl like you should
never wear pants on a date.

12:18.374 --> 12:19.807
Keep digging with those little fingers.

12:19.876 --> 12:21.842
I need 35 cents more
to pay the paper boy.

12:21.911 --> 12:24.478
Well, I have a dime and a quarter.

12:24.581 --> 12:25.613
And a candy!

12:25.715 --> 12:27.181
- Is the candy wrapped?
- No.

12:27.283 --> 12:28.516
Then you can keep it as your reward.

12:28.618 --> 12:30.885
Yay!

12:30.954 --> 12:32.386
Nice try, buddy,

12:32.455 --> 12:33.955
but they won't let you wear that
in the ring.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.323
What?

12:35.391 --> 12:37.158
You got your big bout tonight
with "Homicide" Hurley.

12:37.227 --> 12:38.826
I've got a show tonight.

12:38.928 --> 12:40.928
You don't fight tonight,
you're out of the tournament.

12:41.030 --> 12:42.063
You win this one,

12:42.165 --> 12:43.731
you get your shot at "Killer" Monaghan.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.533
Killer's mom says he's just
getting over the mumps,

12:45.635 --> 12:47.134
so aim for his neck.

12:49.138 --> 12:50.972
Dad, it's the theater.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.006
It's my life.

12:52.108 --> 12:53.474
The show must go on.

12:53.576 --> 12:55.643
And it does every night,

12:55.745 --> 12:57.534
with you just standing there
watching it.

13:03.119 --> 13:05.620
Never mind, just...

13:05.722 --> 13:06.520
do your show.

13:06.623 --> 13:07.855
I got to go meet Father Dunne.

13:23.306 --> 13:24.572
Don't worry.

13:24.674 --> 13:27.108
You know no matter what happens,
he'll always be your dad.

13:28.344 --> 13:29.877
There's nothing he can do about that.

13:29.979 --> 13:32.413
Thanks, Mom.

13:32.515 --> 13:34.482
And if you're wondering
if he'll care any less about you

13:34.584 --> 13:35.783
after this,

13:35.885 --> 13:37.718
I can promise you...

13:37.820 --> 13:39.587
it's hard to say.

13:43.584 --> 13:47.238
He just surprised me by getting
all prickly all of a sudden.

13:48.387 --> 13:50.554
Maybe I have been rude to him
all these years.

13:50.656 --> 13:52.923
Oh, the male ego.

13:52.991 --> 13:56.307
God forbid we ever let on
that we know more than they do.

13:56.347 --> 13:58.143
I just... I hate to think I hurt him.

13:58.198 --> 14:00.649
It only hurt because he cares.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.841
Don't let some silly fight
come between you.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.529
No, that would be terrible.

14:05.597 --> 14:06.730
I really care about him.

14:06.765 --> 14:09.499
Then go after that man, for God's sake!

14:09.601 --> 14:11.835
Or you'll wake up in 50 years,

14:11.904 --> 14:15.439
stuck in a loveless marriage
like me and this lump.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.507
I hate you.

14:17.576 --> 14:20.277
And I'm hoarding money to leave.

14:20.345 --> 14:24.381
$70 more and I'll be on a Greyhound bus.

14:24.483 --> 14:27.017
You used to get more noodles.

14:29.798 --> 14:31.898
<i>I was torn.</i>

14:31.967 --> 14:34.468
<i>Doing the show might cost me
my new connection with my dad,</i>

14:34.536 --> 14:36.803
<i>who I love. A word, by the way,</i>

14:36.872 --> 14:37.771
<i>neither of us would say to each other,</i>

14:37.840 --> 14:39.439
<i>not for another 40 years,</i>

14:39.508 --> 14:40.540
<i>and then, only at the urging</i>

14:40.609 --> 14:42.576
<i>of a very judgmental hospice worker.</i>

14:45.748 --> 14:47.581
Dad! I'm here!

14:47.616 --> 14:48.515
I'm ready to box!

14:48.584 --> 14:49.616
You changed your mind?

14:49.718 --> 14:51.084
The nuns will be pleased.

14:51.153 --> 14:52.419
They got heavy money on Hurley.

14:54.189 --> 14:55.222
You sure this is what you want?

14:55.291 --> 14:56.723
Hello?

14:56.792 --> 14:57.991
It's Peggy.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.092
She says nobody's dead,

14:59.194 --> 15:01.194
but, uh, she still wants to talk to you.

15:01.297 --> 15:03.530
Hi.

15:03.632 --> 15:05.666
No, but he's about to.

15:05.768 --> 15:07.634
All right.

15:07.736 --> 15:09.002
I'll tell him.

15:09.104 --> 15:11.071
Bye.

15:11.173 --> 15:12.105
Theater just called.

15:12.174 --> 15:14.007
I guess some kid named Bobby got sick?

15:14.076 --> 15:15.309
They want you to go on tonight.

15:15.411 --> 15:16.243
Really?

15:16.312 --> 15:17.577
As Don Quixote?!

15:17.646 --> 15:19.746
They didn't say which donkey.

15:19.848 --> 15:20.947
Dad, I'm sorry,

15:21.016 --> 15:22.549
but I really have to do the show.

15:23.752 --> 15:24.618
No.

15:27.189 --> 15:29.323
I'll drive you.

15:29.425 --> 15:30.457
You sure?

15:30.559 --> 15:32.092
Yeah.

15:32.161 --> 15:35.062
We can swing by the house,
pick up your donkey costume.

15:35.164 --> 15:36.897
He's always so superior.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.166
We couldn't order popcorn
on our practice date

15:39.201 --> 15:41.268
because he said salt is bad for you.

15:41.337 --> 15:43.537
At this point,
he's just making stuff up.

15:43.605 --> 15:45.739
Wait, what's a practice date?

15:45.841 --> 15:47.774
Nothing.

15:47.843 --> 15:50.177
Not really the meat of the story.

15:56.251 --> 15:57.417
Lawrence?

15:57.519 --> 15:59.319
Hey, uh, I'm looking for Eddie.

15:59.421 --> 16:00.787
Does he happen to be up there?

16:00.889 --> 16:02.222
Say I'm not here.

16:02.324 --> 16:03.156
He'll be right down.

16:03.258 --> 16:04.458
What did you do that for?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.559
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:05.594 --> 16:07.027
Maybe if I practiced for tonight,

16:07.096 --> 16:08.862
I might have handled it better.

16:16.238 --> 16:18.071
Hey, man.

16:18.173 --> 16:19.740
Hi.

16:19.808 --> 16:23.176
Just wanted to talk about tonight.

16:23.245 --> 16:24.745
About us.

16:24.813 --> 16:26.813
I can see you two need to be alone.

16:35.691 --> 16:37.524
Look, I know you'd rather be
inside with Wendi...

16:37.626 --> 16:38.492
Is that an option?

16:38.560 --> 16:39.493
No! Talk!

16:39.561 --> 16:42.295
He's your brother and you love him!

16:42.364 --> 16:43.497
Okay!

16:43.599 --> 16:44.898
Geez.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.600
So...

16:46.668 --> 16:48.034
about earlier.

16:48.103 --> 16:50.270
Um...

16:50.305 --> 16:53.306
So, being the oldest,
I guess I always felt pressure

16:53.375 --> 16:55.375
because I realized
you guys all looked up to me.

16:55.477 --> 16:56.610
Eh.

16:56.712 --> 17:00.447
And then I went to the seminary
and became a "big deal."

17:00.549 --> 17:02.649
Now that I've quit...

17:02.718 --> 17:04.751
I'm not so exalted anymore.

17:04.853 --> 17:06.752
I'm just the guy that disappointed Dad.

17:06.821 --> 17:08.888
And God. Don't forget God.

17:12.361 --> 17:13.492
I-I'll see you later, kid.

17:13.561 --> 17:15.295
Uh, you got change for the bus, right?

17:15.364 --> 17:17.864
Yeah.

17:22.704 --> 17:24.738
Bobby?

17:24.839 --> 17:25.906
You're sick.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.240
It would seem not.

17:27.342 --> 17:28.842
But Jenny called my mom.

17:28.944 --> 17:30.310
That wasn't Jenny, Understudy.

17:30.412 --> 17:31.378
That was me!

17:31.447 --> 17:33.814
A little thing I like to call acting.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.449
Why?

17:35.517 --> 17:37.417
W-what do you get out of being so mean?

17:37.486 --> 17:40.053
Just a little taste of the power
that Gregg has over me.

17:40.122 --> 17:41.154
Who's Gregg?

17:41.223 --> 17:42.756
He's not my dad, I'll tell you that!

17:42.858 --> 17:44.791
You raced all the way over here
for nothing,

17:44.893 --> 17:47.093
which is all you'll ever be, Understudy.

17:47.162 --> 17:48.128
Nothing!

17:51.567 --> 17:53.667
<i>Just as my dancing
had informed my boxing,</i>

17:53.769 --> 17:55.569
<i>that night, my boxing elbowed its way</i>

17:55.671 --> 17:57.170
<i>into my performing career.</i>

17:57.239 --> 17:58.905
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:59.007 --> 18:00.707
That's enough, Slugger.

18:00.809 --> 18:02.776
Miss Jenny, Timmy hit me!

18:02.878 --> 18:04.211
I want him out of the show!

18:04.313 --> 18:05.779
I can hardly understand a word
you're saying.

18:05.881 --> 18:07.147
Because he struck me!

18:07.216 --> 18:08.682
Well, somebody was bound to.

18:08.784 --> 18:09.883
And you certainly can't go on like that.

18:09.952 --> 18:11.918
Timmy, go get in costume.
It's your big night.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.787
- What?!
- You hear that, Dad?

18:13.889 --> 18:15.021
I'm going on after all!

18:15.090 --> 18:16.022
That's great.

18:16.158 --> 18:17.791
No, this is absurd!

18:17.893 --> 18:20.794
You don't reward the understudy
for injuring the star!

18:20.896 --> 18:22.762
It sets a terrible precedent.

18:22.831 --> 18:26.132
You'll turn Broadway
into a charnel house!

18:26.235 --> 18:28.602
You sure you can't stick around

18:28.670 --> 18:30.103
to watch me do this tonight?

18:30.205 --> 18:33.440
Well, I did find a broken parking meter.

18:33.509 --> 18:34.774
Seems a shame to waste that.

18:36.478 --> 18:38.578
Listen, kid, I'll never understand

18:38.680 --> 18:41.147
this thing you like, this...

18:41.183 --> 18:45.185
jumping around like a chimp
in front of people.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.954
But I recognize passion when I see it.

18:48.056 --> 18:50.524
I think "Homicide" Hurley
got off easy tonight.

18:50.626 --> 18:51.825
Now go.

18:51.927 --> 18:53.326
Break your legs.

18:59.535 --> 19:01.234
To be honest, man, I...

19:01.303 --> 19:03.103
I don't really know who I am anymore.

19:03.171 --> 19:05.005
You're still, like,
the smartest person I know.

19:05.073 --> 19:07.609
Yeah, but most of the people you know

19:07.680 --> 19:09.175
live in our house.

19:09.244 --> 19:10.777
And when it comes to the real
world, this dating stuff,

19:10.879 --> 19:12.345
you're like
a million times smarter than me.

19:12.414 --> 19:14.281
You can do this, man!

19:14.349 --> 19:15.982
Just be fun.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.218
Less talk about socialized medicine

19:18.287 --> 19:21.922
and more, "Hey, look at
the upside-down boat."

19:22.024 --> 19:23.123
I get it, you know?

19:23.191 --> 19:25.125
Less smarty-pants...

19:25.227 --> 19:26.726
more Eddie-pants.

19:26.828 --> 19:28.929
- I got to get going, man.
- You know what?

19:29.031 --> 19:31.965
I never thought you got insecure
about anything.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.434
But it turns out
you're as screwed up as I am.

19:34.536 --> 19:38.038
Hey, they're my parents, too.

19:40.509 --> 19:41.708
Where are you going?

19:41.777 --> 19:43.710
The Fergusons are in Dallas
for a funeral.

19:43.779 --> 19:46.346
They've got a home gym and a doggy door.

19:47.816 --> 19:52.185
♪ The world will be better for this ♪

19:52.287 --> 19:57.624
♪ That one man,
scorned and covered with scars ♪

19:57.726 --> 20:00.327
<i>I was hitting every note,
landing every line,</i>

20:00.429 --> 20:02.696
<i>and playing it all
to the back of the crowd,</i>

20:02.798 --> 20:04.965
<i>which, that night, was row seven.</i>

20:05.067 --> 20:06.466
<i>But that didn't matter,</i>

20:06.568 --> 20:08.621
<i>because my family was there.</i>

20:16.695 --> 20:18.528
Did I miss the donkey?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.854
You were really very good in the show.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.659
So loud. I could hear all your words.

20:28.778 --> 20:31.209
It was a very special night.

20:31.289 --> 20:32.522
I know.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.647
- Even Dad stayed.
- Mm.

20:34.717 --> 20:36.679
I'm gonna remember it forever.

20:36.749 --> 20:38.148
You should.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.610
Because it's never gonna happen again.

20:43.882 --> 20:45.081
Good night, dear.

20:45.184 --> 20:47.284
Will you tuck us in, too, Mom?

20:47.352 --> 20:48.919
Did you have
a theatrical triumph tonight?

20:49.021 --> 20:50.520
No.

20:50.622 --> 20:52.189
Night, boys.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.890
Night, Joey.
