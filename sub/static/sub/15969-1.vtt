00:43.460 --> 00:46.509
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's great.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.557
Hey.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.435
- What's that?
- What?

00:52.594 --> 00:55.268
- Check it out.
- Hey.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.149
Okay.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.151
- Hey, there's a note in it.
- Get out of here.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.206
Yes, there is. It says:

01:13.365 --> 01:14.992
- "Will you mar... "
- Stephanie?

01:18.287 --> 01:21.382
It's no secret
we've been on a journey together.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.125
An adventure.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.930
And I've done a lot of soul searching
and I know...

01:28.672 --> 01:30.549
This is just right.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.347
So will you marry me?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.978
That's so sweet. No.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.314
Sorry?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.192
I can't.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.697
Really?

01:45.856 --> 01:49.986
I really didn't wanna do this right now
but you're kind of forcing my hand.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.781
I'm thinking we've reached
the end of the line.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.451
Really?

01:57.659 --> 02:02.381
Look, Griffin, I know it shouldn't bother
me that you're a zookeeper...

02:02.539 --> 02:04.007
But it kind of does.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.960
And when we first started dating,
I just assumed...

02:07.127 --> 02:10.676
That you would turn into the guy
that I'd always dreamed of being with.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.591
- But... 
- Not your dream guy, I got it.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.101
You had to see this coming.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.224
I bought a ring and rented a horse.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.557
Well, that's not my fault!
Don't yell at me on the beach!

02:21.058 --> 02:22.401
- I love... 
- Stop it!

02:22.559 --> 02:25.187
Do not make this harder
than it has to be. God!

02:25.395 --> 02:28.399
You totally set me up.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.783
Little heads up.
I may have hired a mariachi band.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.499
Oh, there they are.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.709
Just ignore them.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.138
Ignore it.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.490
Thank you, sir. There you go.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.506
Good morning, Barry.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.851
Come on, Donald,
let's move you out of the sun. Come on.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.063
There you go, buddy.
Nice and shady.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.739
- Cherry.
- Thanks, Franky.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.612
See you at the party tonight.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.577
Come on, Shane.
What are you doing?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.162
We talked about this.

04:01.324 --> 04:06.205
His food should always be fresh and
placed inside the door out of the sun.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.341
You go down there.
I am not getting jacked up by him again.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.511
It's been 10 years. Bernie's cool.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.180
Why do you bring
this stuff around here?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.466
You trying to make the rest of us
look bad?

04:18.048 --> 04:20.017
What? No, no.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.928
I feel for him. He's all alone.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.855
Oh, he's all alone.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.767
Look, it all starts with trust.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.273
Sure.

04:29.436 --> 04:33.111
You won't be so cocky when he's
beating you to death with your own arm.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.921
Hey, bern.
Got a little something for you.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.395
Looks like things
just got fun around here, huh?

05:03.553 --> 05:04.850
What is this, anyway?

05:05.013 --> 05:08.483
Is this an old tire
or a gateway to adventure?

05:14.231 --> 05:16.233
It's... it's adventure.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.365
It's an adventure.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.165
Hey, Tony.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.576
Go.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.501
Hey.
How did it go with the tire swing?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.425
Oh, that good, huh?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.923
- Don't know if he's gonna come around.
- Don't get discouraged.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.010
Bernie feels what you're trying to do.
All the animals do.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.058
- You're like the hippo whisperer.
- I don't know.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.261
Hey, is that the new release cage?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.561
Yep.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.270
- The eagle enclosure's almost done.
- I gotta tell you, it is amazing.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.150
- Great job.
- Thank you.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.856
It's getting a lot of attention.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.239
In fact, I may be sitting on an offer
to work my magic...

05:56.398 --> 05:59.493
At the Nairobi zoo in Africa.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.366
Oh, man.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.414
Wow, that's awesome.
Congratulations.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.787
I'm thinking about it, but ....

06:06.950 --> 06:09.624
It's great to be wanted.
You know how that feels.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.171
Oh, I've been in play.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.674
There was a zoo in New Hampshire
that was coming after me pretty hard.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.336
It wasn't so much a zoo.
It was more an animal farm.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.091
But the animals were nice. Cool.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.348
Not big like here.
We didn't have the... 

06:21.506 --> 06:23.759
they had a couple badgers.
A badger and a... 

06:23.967 --> 06:26.516
they had a sick raccoon. Sick.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.147
His name was Peter and he was big.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.188
- Hang in there, girl.
- What happened?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.853
- She's having trouble breathing.
- What's happening?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.988
She's stable and she's sedated.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.657
- I'm gonna get a trach tube.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.570
- What do we do, Kate?
- Don't panic, Griffin.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.455
- Not breathing.
- Support her neck.

06:45.864 --> 06:49.835
On my count. One, two, and ....

06:50.035 --> 06:52.288
She's a big girl. She's a big girl.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.881
- Griffin, you okay?
- Yeah.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.386
There's something blocking her airway.
I need a laryngoscope.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.515
- I don't know what a laryngo... 
- It's in the drawer.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.386
Okay, I got post-its,
cinnamon tic tacs... 

07:07.552 --> 07:10.772
- it's silver, curved and has a light on it.
- Got it.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.525
Come on. There's definitely something
in her throat.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.727
Hold her jaw open.
I'm putting my hand in.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.441
- It's stuck.
- No, come on.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.319
Oh, God. Okay.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.115
- I guess I'm up.
- I can't... 

07:21.274 --> 07:22.696
- Come on.
- Okay, I'll hold.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.658
- Hold the jaw.
- Come on, you can do it.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.206
That's a feeling
I never wanna get used to.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.788
Hurry, hurry.
You can do it, you can do it.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.749
I got it.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.834
She's breathing.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.046
Good luck getting the deposit back
on that one.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.923
You did it.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.633
No, we did it.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.181
We did it.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.264
She's okay.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.270
Oh, God. You're okay.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.154
This place looks amazing, Griffin.
No.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.783
Grif, mom and dad
would have loved this. Thank you.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.697
- Kate.
- Hi, Dave.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.784
That's... Kate heads up
our eagle program. That's Robin.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.920
- This is Venom, he is our reptile guy.
- Hey.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.873
- How are you?
- Oh, you gotta bring it in with him.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.424
Now onto the fiancÃ©e.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.298
Okay, Venom, reel it in.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.474
- Okay, that feels good.
- Yeah.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.014
Hey, come on.
No, you're not married yet.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.648
Congrats on your big day.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.227
I don't know where you kids are going
for your honeymoon, but Omaha...

08:39.394 --> 08:41.943
Stupid with underground fight clubs.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.109
Okay.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.036
- We're gonna circulate.
- Yeah.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.367
All right. Congrats on being hot.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.000
I gots to gets my flows on.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.415
All right, folks.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.372
I'd like to bring up the guy
who is responsible...

08:59.539 --> 09:04.045
For putting together
this little party-slash-field trip.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.554
Dave's brother, Griffin.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.884
Griffin.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.099
- Are you going with Floyd?
- Oh, yeah.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.226
- Go get them.
- I'm getting them.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.728
Let's hear it for him.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.395
Love.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.573
We're all here tonight
to celebrate one thing...

09:24.773 --> 09:26.696
And that's love.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.494
You know, finding the perfect mate...

09:29.861 --> 09:32.740
Is the most important thing
in the world.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.575
No matter what package
they come in.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.128
I mean, you take Floyd here.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.415
Now, porcupines, they... 
they get a bad rap, you know?

09:41.915 --> 09:46.671
And I'm sure you see the sharp quills
and the tough exterior.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.051
But you know what I see?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.350
Just a great guy looking for love.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.976
And that's what Robin sees
in my brother Dave.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.228
- To the couple.
- Yeah.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.528
To you guys.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.026
Congratulations.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.609
All right.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.449
Hi.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.247
God, what was I... ?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.539
Sorry, I just lost my train of... 

10:22.705 --> 10:24.423
I got a train of... train.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.426
What I'm basically saying is... 
I mean, I'm not... 

10:27.627 --> 10:30.301
may not be an expert on love,
you know...

10:30.463 --> 10:31.510
Per se.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.052
But I do know a lot about animals.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.230
He's an indigenous... 
he's a woodland creature.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.731
Did I cover burrowing?

10:39.889 --> 10:44.269
Did I go over burrow
because I don't know if I got... 

10:44.477 --> 10:48.198
I had a whole thing on burrow.
Did it get hotter, 10 degrees hotter?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.279
Where did that breeze go?
It is hot.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.739
My elbows are sweating.
That's weird.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.697
I don't know
why I'm telling you this now. Oh, boy.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.868
I had so many beautiful things... 
I'm just gonna sum up.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.333
I think sum it up,
what I wanted to say.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.050
Dave, Robert, good luck.
That's really what it comes down to.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.054
And anybody who wants to learn more
about porcupines...

11:11.212 --> 11:13.590
I'll be off to the side over here.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.974
Yeah. Food for thought,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.562
- You invited Stephanie?
- Sorry to jump you like that.

11:26.728 --> 11:30.858
I didn't even know Robin
was gonna invite her. I'm an idiot.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.986
You still got a thing for her,
don't you?

11:36.905 --> 11:41.035
So, Stephanie, I saw the way
that you were looking at Griffin.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.710
Is something going on?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.588
I don't know.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.209
I guess I feel bad about
the way things ended between us.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.261
- I might've been a little rough on him.
- A little?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.218
Okay, Robin, a lot. I'll own it.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.385
Seeing him tonight
and up there in his little uniform and ....

11:58.551 --> 11:59.928
So cute.

12:01.512 --> 12:06.689
I don't know, it just reminds me
that he has so much potential.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.446
You deserve a great girl in your life.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.823
But you gotta understand
how the world works.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.115
- What's wrong with being a zookeeper?
- Nothing, you're the best, okay?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.494
It's just ....

12:17.654 --> 12:19.076
Look.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.333
Offer's still on the table
to work at the dealership.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.995
Okay? Because here's you, the grass,
mine's greener.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.796
- Dave.
- No, I'm serious.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.840
You could make
your annual salary in a month.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.636
That is how you get a girl
like Stephanie.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.340
Come on, this could be
a whole new life for you.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.810
Think about it.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.228
Yeah.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.641
Floyd, right?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.227
I hope my being here
doesn't make you uncomfortable.

12:49.394 --> 12:53.319
I'm not uncomfortable.
So comfortable.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.366
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.619
No, it's fine, it's fine. I got it.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.654
Oh, God, it's barbed.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.495
Okay, so, hey, how you doing?
Still in design school?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.952
- No, no, I've been out for a while.
- Okay.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.496
- I'm a buyer for saks now.
- Oh, that's good.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.040
I see you've been busy.
Lead zookeeper.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.876
Yes, yeah.
You know, I got the bump last year.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.511
They don't usually until
you've been here 10 years.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.887
I'm only been here eight.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.391
It's basically like getting a black belt
after only a month of karate.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.848
Or mastering a ....

13:23.469 --> 13:25.187
Let's see ....

13:26.597 --> 13:28.395
That's all I can think of right now.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.401
- Just karate, go with that.
- Yeah.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.603
So it's good.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.564
Yeah.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.404
That's good.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.743
Oh, Griffin, you're bleeding.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.991
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, you are.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.781
Come here.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.417
Let me get it, come... 
I'm not gonna bite.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.874
There.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.545
There you go. Now you're all better.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.426
Anyway, Robin was talking about...

13:59.589 --> 14:04.095
Wanting to see
the animals tomorrow...

14:05.470 --> 14:08.724
And were wondering what are the
odds of getting a private tour?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.267
Not good. Not good at all.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.028
There's a sign-up sheet,
a pretty elaborate waiver.

14:14.187 --> 14:18.033
And you'd have to go through the main
office, which is closed. They close at 4.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.661
- Yeah, doesn't sound good.
- It's not.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.613
Okay, so we're on our own.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.368
- Well, it was really nice to see you.
- Okay.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.001
You know?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.333
Bye, Floyd.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.256
Bye, Griffin.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.511
Dave's right.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.801
I gotta get out of this zoo.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.185
- Closing up shop again, Grif?
- Yeah, just had to clean up.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.895
Meeting.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.026
Let's do this. Come on.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.262
What? Oh, nothing.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.098
I wasn't cleaning my basement.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.776
Okay. Here we go.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.787
If this is another eating intervention,
I'm not hearing it.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
This is my ideal weight. Ask the vet.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.954
Come on. Pop the latch.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.869
Yeah, let's go. We want a good seat.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.037
- What do you think this is?
- Am I psychic?

15:55.204 --> 15:58.458
- We got the call the same time.
- Take it down a peg, just asking.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.883
Bernie.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.883
Hey, we having a meeting.
You wanna come?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.968
You don't.
Don't know why I asked.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.221
Come on.
We're gonna have a meeting.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.431
I'm excited about this.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.766
- I wonder.
- What's going on?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.444
All right. I got a very busy schedule.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.855
This better be good.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.865
You sleep 20 hours a day, Joe.
I think you'll live.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.449
Okay, things I didn't want the group
to know.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.995
Look, we got a problem.

16:28.196 --> 16:32.076
Remember that chick that broke
Griffin's heart? Well, she is back.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.002
- What?
- What, Stephanie's back?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.708
This is not good.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.750
Griffin's thinking of quitting.
We can't let that happen.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.460
He can't leave.
He's the best zookeeper we ever had.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.468
He keeps my hay fresh and he rubs
lotion on me when I get dry skin.

16:46.672 --> 16:51.929
He makes papier-machÃ© antelopes
for me to attack. And inside? Muffins.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.356
Oh, I like muffins.
Can I get a "hey now"?

16:55.556 --> 16:58.810
Plus, he's the only human
who recognizes me as an equal.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.065
In your dreams.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.856
Thumbs, baby.
It's all about the thumbs.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.112
- What do you call this?
- That's a paw.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.367
You can't grab a coffee mug
with that.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.195
You can't wear mittens. It's useless.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.656
I'm so blessed.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.038
Sorry. One more look.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.836
Griffin saved my life.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.040
Right, I made my decision.
We're not helping Griffin.

17:20.248 --> 17:24.048
Really? Because I remember a time
when you needed help with females.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.425
Namely me.
Remember, you were shy.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.932
You sent your buddy over
to test the waters to make sure.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.310
And then you would, like,
follow me around.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.891
I'd look at you,
you'd look away embarrassed.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.601
Okay. We're helping Griffin.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.314
- Now, how do you propose we do it?
- Animals are experts on mating.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.320
- We tell him how to get her back.
- No.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.273
Nobody's talking to Griffin.

17:45.439 --> 17:49.239
You know the code.
We don't ever talk to humans.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.195
You don't break the code, idiot.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.456
Besides,
Griffin's got no shot at this girl.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.993
That is why you're single, Bruce.
You have no sense of romance.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.206
Herbivore.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.415
Maybe it's possible to help Griffin
without talking to him.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.671
The girl's gonna be here tomorrow
and she's interested.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.252
And how do you know that?

18:06.419 --> 18:11.391
She said, and I quote,
"Griffin has potential." Potential.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.595
All we have to do is make him
look like a hero in front of her.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.765
Then zip-zang,
Griffin gets the girl, stays at the zoo...

18:18.973 --> 18:20.225
Everybody wins.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.151
Awesome. We got a plan.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.523
Hey, what's this now?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.359
Wait. You're not a zoo animal.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.900
Excuse me. Am I standing in the zoo?
Then I'm a zoo animal.

18:29.108 --> 18:33.659
Don't get mad at us because no kid
says, "mommy, I wanna see a crow."

18:33.863 --> 18:35.957
Okay, that's the captivity talking.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.331
Enough. You've all made your point,
we'll help Griffin.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.121
But no one breaks the code.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.332
- Understood?
- No breaking the code.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.884
Okay, we're helping a human.
This is big.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.711
You started your diet today.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.006
- He's not even chewing.
- Take a breath.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.142
What, I'm stress-eating.
Stop looking at me!

18:54.342 --> 18:57.095
Much better than the tire we had.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.605
Sorry about that, by the way.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.687
You're gonna enjoy this a lot more.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.944
I don't know. I made it,
I drilled it and put a ball in there.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.776
Get that baby spinning,
have it land in a circle.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.566
What?
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.368
I think you'll like it.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.869
There. There you go.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.622
I'm not sure, kind of like a disco ball.
Look at that.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.749
Party at Bernie's. It's fun.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.501
It's gonna be good.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.086
It sucks being alone here, buddy.
I know.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.084
All right.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.342
Okay.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.466
See you tomorrow, bern.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.472
I don't know.
She just intimidates me, you know?

19:37.635 --> 19:39.888
But you know me.
I don't like to talk about it.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.689
Hey, Griffin.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.483
- Hey, Grif.
- Hey.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.482
We were gonna go see the rhinos...

19:46.644 --> 19:49.488
And we were wondering
if you could show us the way.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.033
You know what? I can't right now.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.660
I'm feeding the giraffe.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.071
She's eating carrots.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.327
Okay.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.755
Here they come.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.341
- See the thumb?
- Yeah, yeah, I see it.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.302
Time to make Griffin
look like a hero.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.843
Here we go. Get it together.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.431
All right, here you go.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.188
Anybody looking? No.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.868
- Oh, my God.
- Joe.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.243
Joe, over here.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.114
Please. This way.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.909
- Get them out of there, I'll distract him.
- Got it.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.745
Joe.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.175
Oh, crap.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.760
Get in.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.269
Oh, God.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.153
Joe.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.980
Joe? Joe.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.866
Joe.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.036
Joe.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.874
Joe.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.254
Joe.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.206
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.668
Oh, I mean:

21:38.088 --> 21:40.056
Wait a sec.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.931
Griffin, I know this is weird.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.765
- Griffin.
- Lion secure, going home.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.326
Haven 't you learned anything
from being under my tutelage?

22:12.164 --> 22:16.761
No. No.

22:32.977 --> 22:36.072
Mommy, look, it's going to eat.
Come on.

22:37.773 --> 22:41.277
- Yeah, it's on, but, like, on reverse.
- Yeah, you should definitely go.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.827
He... ?

22:42.987 --> 22:45.240
He didn't... ?
Wasn't saying anything, did he?

22:47.658 --> 22:49.501
What's going on?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.962
- He's a good one, yeah.
- How much do they weigh?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.678
What's up?

23:03.048 --> 23:06.268
- Good night, Griffin.
- Good night, Manny. Heading home?

23:06.427 --> 23:08.771
If by "home"
you mean Uncle bosoms...

23:08.929 --> 23:11.523
I'll be there in the back,
purple couch.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.021
Okay.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.272
All right.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.857
I know you had your dinner...

23:16.020 --> 23:21.868
But this is just a little reward
for what I like to call a winning attitude.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.404
You care to comment on that?

23:24.945 --> 23:27.243
Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.204
Have a good one.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.626
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

23:49.136 --> 23:54.734
You remember nothing.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.439
I totally think this is working.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.070
Relax. Calm down, calm down.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.325
Breathe. Breathe.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.244
Take it easy. Take it easy.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.823
He's freaking out.
Look at him, look at him.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.083
What do you think I'm looking at?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.411
- You can talk.
- Yeah, we can talk.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.045
I can sing pretty good.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.748
I can teach you
how to give yourself a bath.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.340
- How'd you get out of your enclosures?
- You don't wanna know.

24:21.502 --> 24:25.632
- Actually, I do.
- Okay, but I don't wanna tell you.

24:26.215 --> 24:31.642
- How long have you been able to talk?
- Let's see. Today's Tuesday, so always.

24:31.845 --> 24:32.892
Always.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.399
- Then why haven't you?
- Humans can't handle it.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.901
Any time we talk to humans,
it always ends badly.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.064
Except for parrots.
Somehow they get away with it.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.732
"I be parrot.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.992
Happy Birthday."

24:45.192 --> 24:46.444
Why did you talk to me?

24:46.610 --> 24:49.830
You saved my mate. We tried
to help you connect with yours.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.161
But you blew it.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.038
I appreciate it,
but you know what?

24:53.200 --> 24:56.295
I had a really bad experience
and I don't like to talk about it.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.296
"Don't like to talk about it."

25:00.457 --> 25:02.425
That's crazy.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.800
We've been hearing about
that breakup on the beach every day...

25:05.963 --> 25:07.431
For the last five years.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.139
Okay, I might have mentioned it before
I knew you could understand me.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.521
Come on, man, we heard her talking.
She wants you.

25:14.722 --> 25:19.319
So what if you don't have my great
complexion or my thick, wavy hair?

25:19.476 --> 25:23.026
I would tell you this.
You have nice calves.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.324
Great calves.
Of course I don't have calves.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.826
I basically have columns with toenails.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.371
So you think I should
maybe ask her out?

25:31.363 --> 25:34.537
Okay.
All right, now, slow it down, hot shot.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.211
You ask Stephanie out,
it's gonna end the same way.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.963
You haven't changed,
you don't trust your instincts.

25:40.122 --> 25:43.626
You listen to us
and we turn you into an Alpha male.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.086
I don't know.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.046
I don't think he's got the size.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.216
Size has nothing to do with it.
We both know who the Alpha is.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.387
You're giving me attitude.
That's why I do stuff to your water bowl.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.056
That was you?
You said it was vitamin drops.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.766
- Surprise.
- Oh, that's it.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.102
- Bring it, come on.
- It's been brought.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.653
Oh, boy, here we go again.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.481
It's like watching a fight
between two beanbag chairs.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.532
- I am tired. I'm back in.
- Me too.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.740
You're a good man, Griffin.
You just need a little help.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.997
Yeah.
Who better than us to help you?

26:13.197 --> 26:15.291
- Come on, you honeypot.
- Bring it, big boy.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.621
What have I got to lose?

26:18.660 --> 26:21.038
- That's not instilling confidence.
- Sorry.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.374
Two more licks.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.879
Is it on, is it on, is it on? Yeah.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.148
Hey.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.476
Thought we'd mix things up
a little today.

26:42.643 --> 26:46.398
Got some organic jambalaya.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.287
You know... 

26:53.695 --> 26:55.242
if you ever ....

26:55.823 --> 26:57.951
You want anything, I... 

26:59.326 --> 27:01.579
you could always ask me.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.039
Hey, how's the...?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.129
How's that ball working out for you?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.669
Lot of fun with the... 

27:08.877 --> 27:10.879
any disco...

27:11.213 --> 27:13.841
Parties'?

27:16.426 --> 27:17.894
All right.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.777
Just leave it by the door.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.667
Come on.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.792
Move. Come on, stupid bears.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.748
Do something.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.003
What is he doing?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.964
Hey. Don't do that.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.387
No, no, no. Hey.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.394
Can we get that?

28:06.435 --> 28:08.779
Okay. Now, no sudden movements.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.653
I want you to get to your feet.
Slowly walk to the door.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.198
Come on.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.283
They're not gonna hurt you. Good.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.919
Okay, we're fine, here.
Here we go.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.872
- He backed you down.
- I didn't see you do anything.

28:31.877 --> 28:32.969
Hey, thanks, guys.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.218
I appreciate you showing
some restraint.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.303
Any other day,
that would've been lunch.

28:37.466 --> 28:41.096
But you showed confidence,
what you're not doing with the girl.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.935
See, when I take down a female, I... 

28:44.097 --> 28:46.725
- take down a female, you?
- Don't know me my whole life.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.815
I did three years in Vancouver.

28:49.019 --> 28:52.023
- You got a chick in Canada?
- Yeah, I was dating a kodiak model.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.237
- Kodiak model?
- She's technically a model.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.777
She was on a tobacco can,
born with an extra claw.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.070
She knew how to use it.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.160
Canadian bears are wild.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.456
Very wild.

29:01.615 --> 29:04.368
She's wild in your dreams.
You don't know squat, Jerome.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.624
Were you there, huh?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.164
I didn't think so.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.374
And what's with the "Jerome"?

29:10.540 --> 29:13.464
Anyway, you need to unlock
your inner bear.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.218
The only way that's gonna happen
is to do as we say.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.594
- And that's how you get your girl.
- We get it.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.304
Let's start with your walk.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.888
- My... come on, my walk is fine.
- Fine? It's a hot, stinking pile.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.848
This time he's got a point. Come on.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.104
- Show us your stuff.
- Yup.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.519
My... this is stupid.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.029
- My walk?
- Wipe that goofy look off your face.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.780
You're a predator. Act like it.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.317
Get those paws up.
That's what we do.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.281
What was that?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.411
No, no, no.
This guy's untrainable.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.787
We're wasting our time.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.245
Give me one more shot.
Come on, get your paw up.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.122
Yeah, up. Come on, reach.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.538
- This is ridiculous.
- We know what we're doing.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.047
- Trust it.
- Get your paws up.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.378
There you go.
That's what we're talking about.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.633
Let's see movement.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.087
Swing your paws
like you're swatting salmon.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.755
- Good.
- I don't know, man.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.965
Give us a snort.
Good old bear snort.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.977
Not with your nose, with your mouth.
Get your lips into it.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.931
- There you go.
- Yeah.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.767
- Now lead with your pudding cup.
- My pudding cup?

30:09.933 --> 30:13.403
Yeah, your pudding cup, man.
Get it out front. Remove the mystery.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.943
That's good like that.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.025
Who... '? How would this ever help me?

30:18.233 --> 30:20.861
- Show them the goods.
- This just feels weird.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.076
That's it, looks good. Come on.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.740
Add a roar.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.284
The roar.

30:28.452 --> 30:29.704
Put some oomph into it.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.958
Roar.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.464
- Fine.
- Bend those knees.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.756
- Get low.
- Yeah.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.543
- Shake that money-maker.
- Swing those arms.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.303
- Here's a predator.
- Dig a hole.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.430
- Dig a big old bear hole.
- Dig it.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.011
- Get dirty.
- Stop digging.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.017
- No, keep digging.
- Keep digging.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.265
- What, are you too good to dig?
- That's it.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.101
- Through the wickets.
- That's good.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.933
Kick up those woodchips.
Look at him, a natural.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.147
Scratch your back.
Scratch it on the tree.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.733
- Yeah, he's a bear.
- Yeah, he's a bear, baby.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.524
- You're the bear.
- You're a big bear.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.362
Stop it.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.751
Hi, kids.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.584
Carry them all?

31:13.789 --> 31:16.383
We'll look at the giraffe now.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.095
I appreciate the grub.

31:24.257 --> 31:28.558
No problem.
I popped it myself so enjoy.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.849
I would have left it in longer.
I like mine burnt a bit.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.393
But I wasn't sure
how you weighed in on that.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.104
This is fine.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.490
Hey, Shane.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.829
I was supposed to tell you
there's a meeting tomorrow at 10.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.498
Okay, cool. Thanks.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.497
Who are you talking to?

31:52.285 --> 31:54.708
No, you know what it is?

31:54.871 --> 31:56.373
I'm in a one-act play...

31:56.540 --> 31:57.837
And I was rehearsing.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.466
I know both parts because
I'm understudying the other guy.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.050
And something.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.638
What's the play about?

32:07.467 --> 32:09.390
Steam ships.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.853
I wouldn't do it around him.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.735
That's when they get you, you see?

32:17.894 --> 32:20.113
When you're not focused.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.953
I didn't do it, you know.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.244
- I'm sorry?
- I didn't attack him.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.414
Oh, yeah, he says you did though.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.541
He's a liar, okay?

32:35.745 --> 32:38.669
He never treats us with any respect.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.335
To get us to move,
he prods us with a long stick...

32:41.501 --> 32:43.048
With a nail in the end of it.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.636
One day, I guess I wasn't
walking fast as he wanted me to...

32:46.798 --> 32:51.679
So he swung the stick at me,
but I caught it, and he slipped and fell.

32:51.845 --> 32:55.600
He told everyone I attacked him.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.062
Wow, I never knew any of that.

33:00.270 --> 33:06.073
And my only mistake
was assuming he would tell the truth.

33:06.234 --> 33:09.408
I guess that's what humans do.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.578
They lie.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.585
Not all humans, Bernie.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.379
Look, now,
maybe you got a raw deal...

33:18.580 --> 33:21.254
But sometimes we need
to put the past behind us...

33:21.416 --> 33:24.761
And look towards the future,
you know?

33:27.172 --> 33:31.393
I guess sometimes
we all get stuck living in the past.

33:33.887 --> 33:34.934
Yeah.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.315
Look, is there anything else
I can do for you?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.314
Can you get me my view back?

33:41.937 --> 33:44.031
You know, it's not my call.

33:44.231 --> 33:47.735
I miss it, you know?
Seeing the world.

33:47.901 --> 33:50.279
I used to be able
to climb high enough...

33:50.487 --> 33:53.787
That I could just catch a glimpse
of a few buildings.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.957
Now all I see is cement.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.874
I wish I could help you, Bernie, but... 
I mean, that enclosure's gone.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.132
It's a... 

34:03.291 --> 34:05.134
it's where the snack bar is now.

34:07.879 --> 34:08.926
All right.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.926
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

34:12.132 --> 34:13.179
Anything.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.764
Is t.G.L. Friday's
as incredible as it looks?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.725
It's pretty good.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.777
Your girl's gonna be at the party.
Here's how we get her.

34:22.936 --> 34:27.237
First, answer me this, what do you
think attracts a female to a male?

34:27.399 --> 34:28.821
Looks, success... 

34:29.025 --> 34:30.572
I'm gonna stop you right there.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.829
- It's pee-pee.
- Sorry?

34:32.987 --> 34:38.085
Pee-pee. Smell, scent,
chemistry, pheromones.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.962
Which is why you have to learn
to protect your territory.

34:41.161 --> 34:44.291
- Turn everything into a home game.
- There's gotta be another way.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.172
There's not.
Now, don't be stingy with the magic.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.087
Watch and learn.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.759
Notice the full extension
of my lift leg.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.805
- The proud, soaring arc of my stream.
- Yeah.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.311
See how I raised the bar
from the last pee mark.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.942
And voilÃ©.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.269
You're up, sunshine.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.321
You know,
I really don't feel like doing this.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.450
The zoo is closed. You're fine.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.573
All right.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.075
Not there. That's my spot.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.078
Hey, don't give me attitude.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.209
This will help you
at the dinner tonight.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.870
Right here. Fine.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.711
All right, unzip and make it rain.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.592
Okay, you gotta look away.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.511
Such a delicate flower.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.808
Shut it down. Shut it down.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.347
- Kate's coming.
- What?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.890
- I can't_
- Snap it.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.270
Be a man. Snap it.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.654
- Hey, Griffin, Rebecca and I are going... 
- Hey.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.239
Hey.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.025
It's gonna be hard to unsee that.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.821
I'm sorry about that, I... 
you know what happened... 

35:55.987 --> 35:58.490
the wolf got stung
by one of Venom's scorpions.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.251
And I was taking him
to the infirmary...

36:01.451 --> 36:06.673
And then he started limping bad.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.927
Oh, and the urine
will neutralize the poison.

36:11.086 --> 36:15.136
Exactly, exactly, yes, yes.
And that's why I did it.

36:15.340 --> 36:19.186
I was just peeing on him,
for his health.

36:19.886 --> 36:23.607
Okay, when you finish, I'll give him
an antihistamine just to be safe.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.684
- Sounds good.
- All right, go ahead.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.650
Go ahead. Soak it.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.818
Make sure you get the whole area.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.031
Sorry.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.705
I have to.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.794
Lather, rinse, repeat.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.340
Excuse me, sir.

36:53.545 --> 36:57.391
You do know that we have a functioning
restroom not 20 feet from here.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.598
Oh, you do, good, that sounds good.
Yeah, that's nice.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.387
- Have a good evening.
- You too.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.689
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.193
I've set up my territory, I'm about
to show Stephanie my pudding cup.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.398
What?

37:11.062 --> 37:14.191
- Yeah, thank you.
- Pretty great party, huh?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.117
Yeah, Dave goes all out.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.660
He really does.

37:17.819 --> 37:21.540
Listen, Stephanie, I was thinking...

37:21.698 --> 37:24.451
Weddings can be weird
if you're alone and you... 

37:24.659 --> 37:25.831
oh, God.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.539
No, no, don't. No, it's not you.

37:29.706 --> 37:30.753
Lt's, it's... 

37:30.915 --> 37:34.636
oh, it's my ex, I broke up with him,
but he showed up here anyway.

37:34.836 --> 37:37.009
Sweetness. Funny story.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.971
So I go to the fridge
to replenish the old electrolytes...

37:40.133 --> 37:42.761
After some cross-training,
and there...

37:42.927 --> 37:46.397
Taped to the door, next to the picture
of that kayak I'm getting...

37:46.598 --> 37:50.774
Was the invitation to this wedding
that you wanted me to go to.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.279
So here I be.

37:54.647 --> 37:58.572
No, no, no.
Gale, this is an old friend of mine.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.909
Griffin.
Actually, my ex-boyfriend, Griffin.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.324
Griffin, this is my ex-boyfriend, Gale.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.001
What's up?

38:07.202 --> 38:08.419
Everything.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.415
So listen.

38:11.581 --> 38:16.257
I know we had some stuff,
but I'm making changes.

38:16.461 --> 38:20.136
I sat down with my life coach
and I cleared out everything...

38:20.340 --> 38:22.092
Except for you.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.308
So suddenly I'm more important
than learning the banjo?

38:28.681 --> 38:32.276
Griffin, you wanted
to ask me something. Remember?

38:32.435 --> 38:35.154
- It's very nice meeting you.
- That's what people tell me.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.157
What was I supposed to do?
Her ex-boyfriend showed up.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.995
Nothing, fleeing was the right call.
Fleeing is the new fighting.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.500
I know we flee...

38:47.659 --> 38:50.162
But humans are
at the top of the food chain...

38:50.328 --> 38:51.705
So we should ask Joe.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.837
Why are you concerned
with what the stupid lion would do?

38:55.041 --> 38:59.171
Do you realize that if monkeys'
canine teeth were a little bigger...

38:59.379 --> 39:01.598
We'd hold the title,
king of the jungle?

39:01.756 --> 39:05.135
Let me ask you something,
can the king of the jungle do this?

39:07.887 --> 39:10.640
He's behind me. I saw him mid-flip.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.232
Cut her from the herd.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.066
Cut her from the herd.
That's a good call, Joe.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.653
As long as this other guy's
in the picture, you ain't got a chance.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.076
Next time you see her, get her alone.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.324
That's how you'll get your girl.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.363
That's how you gonna get your girl

39:25.530 --> 39:27.532
that's how you gonna get your girl
yeah, yeah

39:27.699 --> 39:31.203
that's how you get a girl
that's how you get a, get a girl

39:33.121 --> 39:34.794
just focus on the lyrics.

39:34.998 --> 39:38.377
You know what?
It's worth a shot, I'll try it tomorrow.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.796
I basically had
the same advice Joe did...

39:40.962 --> 39:42.964
But he kind of stole my thunder.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.509
- Coming, Barry?
- Okay, you're not listening.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.724
I gotta be honest,
my legs fell asleep when we sat down.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.389
I think I'm here overnight.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.359
Hey. Hey, look, my bus was late.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.023
I need a bike.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.609
Sorry, but that wedding party
just cleaned me out.

40:02.817 --> 40:06.287
Yeah, that's my group.
Please, you got to have something.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.883
That's right.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.352
Cut her from the herd.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.262
How weak.

40:31.930 --> 40:32.977
Hey, Stephanie.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.435
- That's how you're playing it?
- Stay away from her.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.604
- Share the road.
- I'm not good at sharing.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.119
This is not right.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.658
Stop it, this is... 
very dangerous out here.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.585
- Oh, my gosh.
- Get off the road!

41:24.399 --> 41:25.571
Move it. Coming through.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.084
- Taste the heel.
- Hey, easy.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.331
- Taste it.
- Stop it.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.496
I will not get the deposit
if you do that.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.759
Oh, sweet nanny, that is painful.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.968
Oh, Jesus. That is fiberglas. Stop it.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.303
Oh, Jesus.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.438
- Hey.
- Oh, Grif.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.487
You're like a daredevil.

42:07.483 --> 42:11.113
So listen, I've been thinking... 

42:11.279 --> 42:13.577
I was thinking about... 
hold on a second.

42:15.074 --> 42:18.578
Everything just turned light blue.
My body's starting to shut down.

42:18.745 --> 42:22.170
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.459
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.294
I was thinking about the wedding.

42:26.461 --> 42:29.806
I was wondering if maybe you needed
someone to go with you, that I... 

42:30.006 --> 42:32.350
oh, look, Griffin,
I need to tell you something.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.218
Yeah?

42:34.427 --> 42:38.102
I'm gonna go to the wedding
with Gale.

42:38.264 --> 42:41.143
He was supposed to come with me
before we broke up...

42:41.309 --> 42:45.689
And we had this long talk
and I'm really confused right now.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.357
I hope you understand.

42:50.610 --> 42:54.365
And I hope you understand that
that is fantastic. It's better this way.

42:54.530 --> 42:58.285
- Really?
- Yes, yeah. Yes, yeah.

42:58.493 --> 42:59.540
- Okay.
- All right.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.921
All right. Bye.

43:04.832 --> 43:08.507
Get ready to experience
the hail of Gale.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.717
Cherokee style.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.319
You said to cut her from the herd,
I did.

43:24.477 --> 43:27.572
You see this is what happens.
I should've never listened to you.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.903
We didn't tell you to back down.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.318
Stick to your cozy life...

43:31.484 --> 43:35.705
Because take it from me,
you would never make it in the wild.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.664
What did you just say?

43:37.824 --> 43:42.045
In the wild, I would never let a rival
dictate the outcome of a situation.

43:42.245 --> 43:45.465
"In the wild"?
You were born in captivity, Joe.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.547
In this very zoo. I bottle-fed you.

43:48.709 --> 43:51.804
"In the wild." You've never been
in the wild a day in your life.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.473
I could walk 25 yards
and buy a balloon on a stick.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.384
- "Wild."
- You're missing the point.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.395
Whether you're taking out a rival
or taking down prey...

43:59.554 --> 44:02.899
It's not just the attack,
it's about everything leading up to it.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.978
The females in the pride,
they do the hunting.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.028
- We do.
- Thank you.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.231
And the fighting.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.862
Okay, you know what?
Are you giving the advice?

44:13.067 --> 44:17.493
If you are, I don't need to be here.
Yeah, you heard me, I will walk.

44:17.697 --> 44:18.823
Relax, Joe.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.163
The best way for a male
to attract a female...

44:21.325 --> 44:23.123
Is to be seen with another female.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.500
If he's going to the wedding,
he needs a date.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.461
That's it. Good night.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.760
Find a date, sweetie.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.221
I'll do that.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.268
So basically you're using me.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.685
Not basically, I am.

44:40.887 --> 44:43.185
This is very junior high,
you do realize that.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.600
It is, I admit it, I am not proud.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.902
I don't think you should go
through this.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.062
- No, I do, I definitely do.
- I don't know.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.277
You can't remember the last date.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.783
This isn't a real date.

44:53.941 --> 44:57.241
If I'm gonna go on a fake date,
I was hoping I'd fake date a doctor.

44:57.403 --> 44:59.076
Or somebody French.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.907
Please.

45:01.532 --> 45:06.459
If you do this for me, I will give you
half my lunch for the next three years.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.460
You know what?

45:08.623 --> 45:10.091
And this, to sweeten it.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.461
That's a signing bonus, if you do.
Take it, look at that.

45:13.669 --> 45:14.716
All right, I'll go.

45:14.879 --> 45:19.510
But I'm calling you Francois Dubois,
cardiologist.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.470
You can call me Betty,
as long as you're going.

45:31.187 --> 45:32.234
Hey, buddy.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.535
Got a little something for you.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.204
Happy Birthday... 

45:41.948 --> 45:44.952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

45:45.159 --> 45:48.038
It's out. It's out. I'm sorry.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.415
I was just messing with you.

45:51.624 --> 45:52.796
Oh, my God.

45:52.959 --> 45:55.007
Yeah, I mean, don't do that to me.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.672
It's a gelatine cake.
Kate made it for you.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.804
- She's a good lady.
- Oh, my heart's racing, man.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.851
Was that on a plate?

46:11.394 --> 46:14.898
- No, you're good.
- Thank Kate for me.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.402
That's it?
You're all birthday-ed out?

46:18.609 --> 46:21.738
I'm sure you got things to do.

46:22.697 --> 46:25.496
Actually, we do.

46:30.413 --> 46:32.461
How are we gonna pull this off?

46:32.665 --> 46:36.386
- I don't exactly blend in.
- It's simple.

46:36.585 --> 46:39.338
We just tell people
we're going to a costume party.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.266
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Maybe not at first.

46:42.425 --> 46:47.602
But when you put on this shirt
and talk, they will.

46:47.805 --> 46:53.687
Griffin, I'd hug you,
but it's fifty-fifty I'd crush your spine.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.773
You know what? Fist bump works.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.112
- My wrist.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

46:59.317 --> 47:02.196
Payback, baby. Come on.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.872
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.084
- Can I drive?
- No, you cannot.

47:12.288 --> 47:13.380
Please?

47:13.914 --> 47:15.336
Sorry, bern, not happening.

47:33.267 --> 47:34.735
Look at that up there.

47:42.735 --> 47:45.158
I'm so alive.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.307
Take it easy, man. No problem.

48:09.512 --> 48:10.889
Here it comes, you ready?

48:30.408 --> 48:33.412
Shut up.

48:42.211 --> 48:46.432
Hi, y'all, welcome to Friday's.
Can I interest you in... ?

48:47.216 --> 48:50.516
Yeah, we were just
at a costume party.

48:50.719 --> 48:53.939
- Zookeeper.
- Gorilla.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.691
Preppy gorilla.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.395
We noticed there was already
a gorilla so we were like:

48:59.603 --> 49:04.450
"You know what? Let's put wings on
this loser train, get our Friday's on."

49:07.236 --> 49:09.910
- You look so freaking real.
- He does, yeah.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.661
Can I try on your head?

49:11.866 --> 49:13.493
Yeah, no, l... you know... 

49:13.701 --> 49:16.295
it's all hooked on
with wires and whatnot.

49:16.495 --> 49:19.749
And stink.
This thing hasn't been washed in years.

49:19.957 --> 49:23.257
I think the last guy who wore it
might have thrown up.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.508
Yeah.

49:24.712 --> 49:25.884
Can I get your order?

49:26.046 --> 49:29.300
I'm just gonna go with the baby backs
and some fries.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.514
And for you?

49:32.136 --> 49:33.558
Thirty oranges.

49:43.772 --> 49:45.774
No, Bernie, that's ice. That's cold.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.615
Should've warned you.
It's called a brain freeze.

49:50.112 --> 49:53.036
Gonna get worse before it gets better.
Ride it. Ride it.

49:53.240 --> 49:57.040
Gonna subside in 10 seconds.
Yeah, that's ice, but it's deadly. Deadly.

50:05.711 --> 50:10.091
We'd like to send that table of
secretaries a basket of zucchini fries.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.429
You got it.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.107
Yeah.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.243
My eyes.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.543
Yeah.

50:54.176 --> 50:57.100
I'm so glad I met you.

51:11.527 --> 51:14.280
Penny for your thoughts?

51:14.446 --> 51:17.700
Just hanging out,
enjoying your company.

51:18.409 --> 51:21.504
So there's talk
you might leave the zoo.

51:22.204 --> 51:27.051
I was just upset. Thought that's what
I needed to do to get Stephanie back.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.095
No, Bernie,
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

51:30.296 --> 51:32.139
I wanna thank you.

51:32.298 --> 51:36.269
Tonight you gave me
more than I could ever ask for.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.721
You're very welcome, Bernie.

51:39.346 --> 51:40.768
You're a good friend.

51:41.557 --> 51:45.152
Hell, you're my best friend.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.276
I just made this weird, didn't I?

51:53.527 --> 51:55.120
No, no, not at all.

51:55.321 --> 51:57.164
Okay, good.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.327
Can I try on your watch?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.120
Now it's getting weird.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.515
What are you doing out?
Someone can see you.

52:14.673 --> 52:17.347
- No, no one's around.
- We were worried about you.

52:17.551 --> 52:20.179
Tell me you're not wearing that
to the wedding.

52:20.346 --> 52:23.350
- No, no, I got an outfit.
- All set with the other female?

52:23.515 --> 52:25.563
Got it covered,
Kate's coming with me.

52:25.768 --> 52:27.395
- Oh, good choice.
- Thanks.

52:27.603 --> 52:30.698
- Joe, anything else for Griffin?
- What would I know?

52:30.856 --> 52:34.281
- You're the expert on everything.
- God, your mother ruined you.

52:34.443 --> 52:36.821
She did not. Your mother ruined you.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.082
Has anyone got a game plan
for the ex-boyfriend?

52:40.282 --> 52:41.659
We forgot about him.

52:41.867 --> 52:44.416
Look. I couldn't help overhearing.

52:44.578 --> 52:47.422
You wanna intimidate a rival?
You gotta do this.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.587
And if that doesn't work,
assume attack position.

52:52.753 --> 52:55.757
Okay, if I was in a pond
that would be my go-to move.

52:55.964 --> 52:58.592
- I respect that.
- You better take me with you.

52:58.801 --> 53:01.020
- Bernardo.
- Oh, my God, it's Bernie.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.430
Hey, that's great.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.974
- Bernie, you made it.
- All right, all right.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.438
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.020
Here's what I'm thinking.

53:09.186 --> 53:12.736
Take me along, you know,
just in case you need some backup.

53:12.940 --> 53:16.319
- Bern, I gotta do this on my own.
- I'll sit at another table.

53:16.485 --> 53:22.117
You won't even know I'm there.
I've got unbelievable mingling skills.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.660
Bernie, you're a gorilla.

53:27.788 --> 53:30.507
I can't believe you just went there.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.009
All right, fine.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.304
But if you get in a jam, call us.

53:35.504 --> 53:38.508
- Will do, all right?
- We're gonna need your cell phone.

53:38.674 --> 53:40.802
- What?
- Hand it over.

53:41.468 --> 53:44.267
Fine. Here you go.
Thanks. Thanks, guys.

53:44.471 --> 53:48.066
All right, everybody back to
your enclosures before the zoo opens.

53:48.767 --> 53:53.113
- Where did you get the watch?
- Don't you worry about it.

53:55.691 --> 53:56.817
Venom?

53:57.025 --> 53:58.572
I got you. I've got you covered.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.864
Sure this is gonna help
with the ladies?

54:01.029 --> 54:04.499
Hey, Venom,
I need to ask you a favor...

54:05.242 --> 54:06.289
Franky.

54:07.661 --> 54:11.416
- Venom, I need to borrow your car.
- Absolutely.

54:14.209 --> 54:17.509
- Gonna need your keys.
- Oh, yeah, they're in my pocket.

54:18.464 --> 54:21.013
Oh, I had a little dust-up
with the copperhead.

54:21.175 --> 54:24.429
Yeah, I won't be able to move the arm
for another six hours.

54:24.636 --> 54:27.139
Go get yourself some keys, brother.

54:37.357 --> 54:38.404
Other pocket.

54:43.572 --> 54:45.119
Thanks.

55:19.942 --> 55:21.819
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

55:22.027 --> 55:23.779
You look amazing.

55:24.363 --> 55:25.910
- Thank you.
- No.

55:26.073 --> 55:29.202
No, you overdid it. Don't you see?

55:29.451 --> 55:32.955
You look too good for me.
People are gonna know it's a setup.

55:33.121 --> 55:36.216
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.010
What did you want me to do?
Come in my work clothes?

55:41.380 --> 55:43.883
No, no, we don't have time now.
Thank you.

55:48.053 --> 55:50.147
Yeah, you would know.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.182
Here, come here.

55:54.726 --> 55:58.447
She didn't notice us at the church,
now she's gone. She's just gone.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.316
We tussle a little bit ....

56:00.524 --> 56:01.571
There she is.

56:01.733 --> 56:05.829
Then the sea lion lets me go.
Thirty seconds later, I resurface.

56:07.406 --> 56:10.501
- And he's killing over there.
- What's the game plan here?

56:10.659 --> 56:13.412
This whole depressed energy
is not getting the job done.

56:13.620 --> 56:16.464
- I can't compete with him, all right?
- I don't care.

56:16.623 --> 56:21.800
And to this day, you can't say
my name around Jose Canseco.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.260
I know.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.763
Give me your hand.

56:28.343 --> 56:29.390
What?

56:30.345 --> 56:31.972
Come on.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.526
She's looking.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.987
- You positive she saw us?
- Yes.

56:45.986 --> 56:49.035
- She just looked over here.
- Laugh.

56:49.239 --> 56:52.664
- What?
- Laugh like we're really having fun.

57:02.169 --> 57:04.092
Okay, take it down.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.801
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

57:08.967 --> 57:12.642
Just keep... don't look... turn away... 

57:12.846 --> 57:16.567
- oh, God, I just sucked in a fuzz.
- Are you okay?

57:17.601 --> 57:21.105
Okay, everybody,
I know tonight isn't about me...

57:21.271 --> 57:24.275
But my beautiful girlfriend,
Stephanie, and I...

57:24.441 --> 57:27.069
Recently won
a ballroom dancing competition.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.996
I hardly had any lessons,
but I'm wicked athletic...

57:30.155 --> 57:31.532
And like I said, we won.

57:31.740 --> 57:35.586
In honor of the bride and groom,
we'd like to perform our dance.

57:36.578 --> 57:37.625
Get up.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.928
This is our song.
This is my song with Stephanie.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.220
No, it couldn't be.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.223
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

57:52.386 --> 57:53.854
No. No.

57:54.012 --> 57:57.312
Okay, this is definitely the song,
then.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.943
Maybe it's a coincidence.
It's a very popular song.

58:00.102 --> 58:01.775
Maybe she is thinking about you.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.405
I'll wait.

58:10.696 --> 58:13.575
I don't believe this.
This is a clear statement.

58:13.782 --> 58:17.252
It's premeditated, very definitive.
She knew exactly what she was doing.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.709
This is definitely on purpose.
We are... 

58:19.913 --> 58:20.960
okay, okay.

58:27.045 --> 58:28.888
Can you do any of that?

58:29.172 --> 58:30.344
No.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.387
Okay, you're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.

58:34.553 --> 58:37.147
We're gonna do it.
Oh, man, they're good.

58:38.765 --> 58:40.608
He's lifting her.

58:40.767 --> 58:44.567
How did they... ? Wait.
They practiced, I have a dress on.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.402
Wait. I can do this one.
Hold me, grab me.

58:50.569 --> 58:52.788
- Have you got me?
- You know what? I have you.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.448
No one's looking. Get off.

58:58.535 --> 58:59.582
Thank you, thank you.

58:59.745 --> 59:01.622
All right, freestyle.

59:02.247 --> 59:04.796
Us too, over here.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.807
He did a push-up. He did a push-up.

59:19.264 --> 59:23.895
- Well, that was really great.
- They're, like, the perfect couple.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.570
Hold on a sec.

59:36.198 --> 59:38.371
This is our song.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.664
Come on. Come on.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.629
Did you know...

59:49.711 --> 59:51.588
That the female eagle...

59:54.257 --> 59:58.888
Is attracted to the male...

59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.107
That can fly the highest?

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.405
Soar with me.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.233
Oh, my gosh.

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.448
Yeah.

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.693
You know what?
I'm gonna go get some air. Okay.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:36.906
Thanks.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:41.282
- Madame, please, don't touch that.
- Sorry.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.580
Okay. All right.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.716
Come back here. Get down.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.386
This is prohibited.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.988
What's he doing?

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.202
Griffin.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.300
I'm so sorry and I'm gonna
reimburse you for everything.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:40.306
Don't sweat it. The ice sculpture
was her mother's idea.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.430
- How is Robin's leg?
- Oh, she's fine.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.687
- It was more of a pull than a tear.
- I hit her so flush.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.185
- She just went with the fall.
- The legs were:

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.108
- Agile.
- Yeah, she's bendy.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.810
Don't worry about it. Relax.

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.770
All right. Thanks, bro.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.701
Listen.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.988
I don't know what you're trying
to prove with all your ribbons...

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.327
And your fancy moves...

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.118
But what do you say
you just back the hell off?

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:19.220
And what do you say we drop the
moves and we settle this like men?

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.550
Okay. Come on, let's go.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.885
I haven't beaten anybody
since my birthday.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:30.857
What's up? We gonna do this?

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:36.776
What are you doing?

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.992
- What are you doing?
- It's attack position.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:44.036
Man, it's gotta suck to be you.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.740
Attack.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.910
Griffin's phone. Go for Bernie.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.871
- I split my pants.
- I'm putting you on speaker.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.130
So how's it going?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:57.509
What part of "split my pantsâ
don't you get? My butt's hanging out.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.762
I took out an ice sculpture,
Gale got in my face, it's a mess.

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:03.511
Griffin,
if you wanna give up, I get you.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.137
- He's not giving up.
- Okay.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.768
Don't back down from that guy.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:09.475
You get in his face,
make him back down.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.228
As far as the girl goes,
you keep her off balance.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.025
You insult her. That's right.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.733
You make her feel bad.
Then you compliment her.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:21.366
You knock her down, you bring her up.
When she seems interested, walk away.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.943
Throw poop at her.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.154
That's how I met Karen.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.785
You can do this.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.333
- Go.
- Close the deal, Griffin.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:31.994
Throw the poop.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.917
I'm doing this.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:43.092
- What's up, puppy-breath?
- What?

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.345
Just saying looking good,
freckle-chest, yeah.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.301
Man, I am hungry.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.183
Target sighted.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.438
Griffin, what's going on?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.696
Four words:

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:07.908
I need dessert, go.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.659
God, you're beautiful.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.463
- I am?
- Yeah, but you're still here.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:18.089
Oh, dessert, go... 

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.047
okay, I'm going.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.596
Thanks, boss.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.761
Whoa, guy, back for more?

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:35.690
Does she talk about me?

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.518
Sorry?

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:41.696
Does she mention me?

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.904
Does the thought
of what Steph and I had haunt you?

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.943
You know, keep you up at night?

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.953
You mean the way you flamed down?

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:52.283
Do we laugh every time we see
a couple riding a horse on a beach?

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.167
- Oh, yeah.
- Not that specifically.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.419
Every time we see
an engagement ring...

01:05:56.578 --> 01:06:03.052
A whisky bottle with a note in it,
a mariachi band, horse stables or sand.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.303
We laugh until we can't breathe.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.259
And then we make out...

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.432
Hard.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.934
- Your name's Gale.
- What?

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.599
- You have a woman's name.
- No.

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:20.314
No, Gale like Gale sayers,
the football player.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.650
You wish. Perfume and Teddy bears.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.565
Daddy must have wanted a girl
so he named you Gale.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:29.118
- Watch it.
- Oh, sorry, Gale, you're a female.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:33.748
- Hey, man, you better back off.
- Want me to back off, crystal Gayle?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.919
- You got problems, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.123
Hey.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.049
Not in the mood, hammer thumbs.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.802
Griffin, gone.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.645
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.688
So tell me everything.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.021
- What was with the robot moves?
- I don't know, I panicked.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:03.812
I also ripped my pants
and cried a little. It's a blur.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.567
That was so fun.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.656
Can we please do this
every weekend?

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:14.368
Just show up at weddings and trash
the place? Because we are good.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:18.206
You know, forget good, we're great.
And we're bigger than weddings.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.915
- We should rob banks.
- I'm in.

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:23.378
If you say, "let us knock off
a gas station," I'd do it right now.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:27.006
Give me your hand, feel this.
Feel my heartbeat, it's like a rabbit.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.632
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.055
Actually, that's not good.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:34.009
- Yeah, no, I gotta get that checked.
- Yeah.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:37.938
And Kate, you were incredible.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.855
Thank you.

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.899
I'm really glad that you asked me
to come out tonight.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.524
Francois.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:54.780
I heard what happened.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:58.792
I'm so sorry.
Gale can be such an idiot.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.999
Hey, I know you.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:05.756
- You're that little zoo girl, right?
- Kate, yeah.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:10.463
Okay, thank you so much
for saving us from that lion.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.973
Oh, my God, I almost passed out.
I was so scared.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:20.814
Grif, do you think maybe we could go
somewhere and talk?

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.269
- Can we just have a sec?
- Sure.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.243
It worked. Can you believe it?

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:37.451
Yeah.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.082
That's... that's amazing.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.912
- That's what we came here for, right?
- It is, I... 

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.622
- you need to do this.
- Yeah?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.381
- Yes, yes.
- You helped so much, thank you.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.636
No, I'm just gonna take a taxi,
or a shuttle or something.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.636
- Go, go.
- Are you sure?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.345
I can't believe it, thank you.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.344
Hey, Stephanie.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:03.310
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.274
Okay, let's review your order.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:12.532
That'll be 64 meat lover's pizzas,
32 Caesar salads.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:16.032
And can I interest you
in our new fudge roll?

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.497
Yes.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:24.627
All right, let's see,
that's a total of $1636 74.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.170
Will that be cash or credit?

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.048
Hang it up, hang it up.

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:30.716
So close.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.840
I am so happy right now.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.546
You know that, ever feel that?
All the time, like... 

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.761
you happy now?
Because right now I'm happy.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:41.895
And it's, like, all of a sudden it just
hits you, like, bam, I'm happy now.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:45.353
Gosh, you know, I have a fashion show
tomorrow, I want you to come.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:49.310
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to work.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.231
Sad face.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.567
- How about instead... 
- What?

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:58.532
You come to the zoo.
I give you a private tour.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.535
That's a terrible idea.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.788
I really thought you were different.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.708
But the same old zoo stuff.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:13.301
You know what?
Let someone else zoo-keep tomorrow.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.213
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.058
I don't remember this Griffin.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:24.058
Yeah, well, you get used to it
because now it's all about you.

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.391
- Okay.
- You know what else?

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.602
You got a bat in the cave.
Yeah, she got a booger.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.270
- No, don't say that.
- Gross.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.565
No, other side, nostril.
Take care of that.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.904
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- You better.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.068
- Don't go anywhere.
- Not going anywhere.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.489
- Throw out the napkin.
- Okay, I'm so sorry.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:46.042
- Dead empty when you get back.
- Okay.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:57.553
Jurgen. Jurgen.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.840
- Stephanie.
- Hi.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.765
Kiss, kiss.

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.807
This is Jurgen Milraux.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.682
Who is this chaotic pile of man?

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:13.771
He's ruining the vibes here.
He is a waste of space.

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:15.605
I'm sorry, what?

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:21.695
You scream, "help me,
I'm worthless and funny-looking."

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.910
Can l...?

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:27.416
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:30.503
- Hey, siegfried, where's Roy?
- What?

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.799
How's the chocolate factory,
Willy Wonka?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.379
I'm sorry, but you walked
right into that one, grandma hair.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:40.679
Grandma hair?

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:44.263
He got the grandma hair,
he got the grandma hair.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:46.018
I don't understand one word.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:51.354
Here's what you have to understand,
your face is a poem.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.979
I feel...

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:58.739
...pleasure.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.288
Whoa, let's put the donkey
back in the barn.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.159
Gonna mingle.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:22.635
You were awesome in there.
Oh, my God, my friends love you.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:28.016
You were so great. I gotta say,
you are really getting there.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:35.231
Look, I hope you don't mind
but I talked to your brother...

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:38.062
And you have a job at the dealership
if you want it.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:42.241
Is that pushy?
Hey, you know what? Fine, I'm pushy.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.777
It's just... 

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:48.494
I think that that zoo
is really holding you back.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.793
You deserve better.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.460
We deserve better.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.880
We?

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:20.859
Good call, Glenn.
An animal like you on this bad boy?

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.571
It's top of the food chain. Follow.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:30.119
Shana, wanna grab us
an espresso and a Montblanc?

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:32.704
- We're having a signing party.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:34.706
Enjoy the hunt.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:41.883
Dancing.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.481
- Back off, Nimer.
- You back off.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.740
- Oh, not cool.
- Yeah.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.031
What's up?

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.118
- Welcome to the dream.
- Help!

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.955
I don't like this thing!
Make it stop, make it stop!

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.680
- That looks difficult.
- You know what's not difficult?

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.515
Giving a supermodel the bad news...

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:37.057
That I can't date you because
I'm already dating a supermodel.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:43.900
Yeah.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.951
- I gotta say, this is incredible.
- Where have you been?

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.410
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, I... 

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:57.792
it's time.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:00.955
Oh, God, he's calling,
letting her know he's here.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.916
Watch this, look, look, look.

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:08.216
- Aren't they amazing?
- Yeah, no...

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:11.553
They're great.
They're fast and sincere.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:15.562
- Did you know they mate for life?
- I do now.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:18.890
Listen, Kate, I wanted you
to be the first to know...

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:22.606
That I took a job working
for my brother at his dealership.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:29.367
- Shut up.
- I'm serious, I figured I'd... 

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:33.280
I'd done everything I set out to do
in the zoo game and it was ....

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:37.041
The zoo game? What the hell
are you talking about, Griffin?

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.294
You love working here, you're great
at it. The animals love you.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:45.425
Yeah, but maybe that's not enough.
It's time I start thinking about myself.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.127
Okay, is this coming
from you or Stephanie?

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:52.549
No, it's my decision" I mean, she
thinks it's a good idea, but I do too.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.598
Not buying it.
You can't see what's happening?

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:58.308
Yeah, I am changing me.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:01.812
No, she's changing you
into something that you're not.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.314
Well, maybe what I was before
wasn't what I was.

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:08.903
And it is now, maybe, that it is
if it is the way it is.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:12.280
- You're not making any sense.
- Makes enough sense that you get it.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:15.659
Okay, look...

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:19.667
If you wanna quit,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.998
But I want you to look me in the eye,
and tell me this is what you really want.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.847
It is.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:38.101
There you have it.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:05.663
Hey, bern...

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:08.795
Got your favorite.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:16.803
- Hey, listen, I just wanted to... 
- Save it.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:18.429
I already heard.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:23.894
You know, you almost had me
convinced things could be different.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.276
That I could actually trust
someone again.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:31.314
You can.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.361
Oh, I gotta take this. One sec.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.201
Yo, go for Grif.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:42.537
No, mohegan blue.
Chrome wheel package, buddy.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:46.955
Papers are all ready for you,
make it happen, slam it.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.373
All right, gotta go.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.756
Oh, sorry, bern.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:55.009
All people lie
and I was an idiot to believe you.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.863
Hey, Shane.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.408
I'm gonna let you in
on a little something.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:27.249
Ten years ago,
you and Bernie had an incident.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:31.333
I know what you did.
I also know you lied about it.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.090
So?

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:39.302
So if you ever do
anything like that again...

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:44.562
I will go to your house and I will beat
you in front of your mother.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.694
I'm telling you, vern, this baby does
zero to 60 in under four seconds.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:00.995
Yeah, I don't know, I... 

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:03.656
- I got grandkids.
- That's even better.

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:07.209
You stick them back here.
You tell them it's a secret cave.

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:28.347
I can't take it. I miss Griffin.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:31.229
I know you can't see it
but my lip won't stop quivering.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.607
- He wouldn't be gone if you'd listened.
- You talked to him first.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.819
- Yeah, he's right, you know?
- I can't take it.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.493
- You're killing us with the crying.
- You were sobbing all night.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:44.451
- I wasn't, I have sleep apnea.
- Sounded like baby-crying.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.828
- Baby-crying.
- What did you say, thumbs?

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:50.837
- Come down and say it to my face.
- I leave this tree, I'm slapping you silly.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.123
You come down
and I'll use you as a loofah.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.298
- How? You have no thumbs.
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.173
Let's do this. I'll start from my back.
Bring it.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:02.007
- That's it, I'm quitting my diet.
- Can't quit something you never started.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:05.514
- You know what I think we should do?
- Not a zoo animal!

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.015
Hey, Kate.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:14.776
Hey, Venom.
Oh, what are they doing out?

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.903
Grieving. They miss Griffin.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:20.483
- Oh, I know how they feel.
- Yeah.

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:26.789
Look, Venom, I'm sorry,
but I'm leaving the zoo tomorrow.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.918
- You too?
- Yeah.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:36.921
The eagle enclosure is up and running
so I'm taking a job in Nairobi.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.876
Why?

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.306
I was gonna pass because I started
having feelings for someone here...

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:47.810
But he's with somebody else, so....

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:50.312
You know?

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.890
I do.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:20:59.359
What are you doing?

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.821
Oh, what are you doing?
Don't you play possum.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.447
- What?
- You know?

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.528
You started having feelings.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.949
Come on, "someone here."

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.331
I was talking about Griffin.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.379
Tragic misread of situation.

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:24.639
Feel as though
you're breathing through your eyes.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:27.846
Hey, babe, how was your day?
Did you sell a lot of cars?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:32.013
Three, but you know what? One
guy, he didn't feel like he needed it.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.234
- Do you love it?
- Trying to complete the pose ....

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.192
- Is that a chair?
- Yes, it's a Chintoko.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:43.654
- Really?
- There's only five in the entire world.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.234
Sit, sit, sit.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.362
- Yeah, okay.
- I love it.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.914
- Isn't it comfy, cozy?
- Yeah.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:55.123
Totally amazing. I just think
this whole place looks so great.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.297
It's really just... it's coming together.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:21:59.919
I'm so happy.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:03.799
Really gives this whole room
a nice zhuzh. You know what I mean?

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:07.597
Hey, you know what? I ordered in
dinner tonight from Le Chereaux.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.050
Oh, you know what else?

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:14.017
That just reminds me, we have an
absinthe tasting on Mathieu's sailboat.

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.223
- Yeah, Mathieu.
- Do you remember him?

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.360
He's disgustingly rich.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.233
Okay, I gotta get my yoga.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:24.862
Hey, you think it's bad feng shui
that we have a tv in the living room?

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.491
I feel if I do yoga in here...

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.870
It will counterbalance
the whole bad juju, you know?

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.780
Bad juju of the tv.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:36.790
Wait till I show you
this new dress I bought.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:54.679
What's wrong?

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.641
Hoping for someone else?

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.529
Hungry?

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.290
Guys, see that lady there?

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:18.791
I just sold her an extended warranty
we don't even have.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.875
Nice, guy, nice.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:24.212
We've got a high roller checking out
the Mercedes McLaren.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:36.262
Knock yourself out, Nimer.

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.853
Oh, you got a good eye.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.987
Griffin Constantine Keyes.

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:46.863
The changes I've seen in you...

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:51.118
These past few weeks
have been nothing short of remarkable.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.288
And I've been doing
a little soul-searching.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:58.413
And I made a mistake five years ago
on that beach.

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:03.589
- And I wanna correct it. So will you... ?
- Yeah, not gonna happen.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.302
What?

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:11.429
Come on,
you had to see this coming.

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:14.888
Look, when we first started dating
you assumed I was gonna turn into...

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.724
The type of guy
you always dreamed about.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.729
But you know what?

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.856
I don't like that guy.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.814
I don't like this job.
I don't, bro, I'm sorry.

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:28.272
It's not... yeah, this I love.
But we'll always have this, you know?

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.107
I love you, right? Okay, good.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:33.068
I don't like this suit.
I don't like our chintaki chairs.

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.075
- Chintoko.
- Either, I don't like them.

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:39.250
I don't like that I can't understand
90 percent of the stuff you talk about.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:44.797
But most of all,
I hate who I've become.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:55.424
I'll ignore them.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.435
Shut up.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:05.977
Shut up, he didn't say yes.
I'm not gonna pay you.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:20.498
Come back for your watch?

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:25.288
No, I came back to see if you were
interested in happy hour at Friday's.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.499
Look, if you're here just to yank
my chain... 

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:31.339
I'm not.
I wanna tell you I'm sorry.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.841
And I know I let you down.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:37.516
And that you... you're my best friend.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:47.192
And, oh, yeah, I... 
I dumped Stephanie.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:51.238
- Nicely done.
- Yeah.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:55.993
- Hey, what happened to your eye?
- It's good to have you back, Grif.

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.904
Hey, Griffin, you're back.

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:00.785
Oh, everyone's gonna be so happy.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:04.622
- Right now I gotta go talk to Kate, okay?
- Griffin, Kate's gone.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.579
- She's leaving for Africa tonight.
- What?

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:10.044
She's on a 9:15 flight.

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:13.127
Oh, man, it's my fault.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.341
- I blew it.
- It's my fault.

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:19.675
- I told you to be someone you're not.
- No, you know what? It's my fault.

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:23.012
I was worried you were gonna leave,
I wasn't thinking about you.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.144
It's not my fault.
I said throw poop at her, always works.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:29.685
Who cares whose fault it is?

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.105
There's still time. Let's get Kate.

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:38.240
Follow me, everyone.
Nothing can stand in our way.

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:42.156
Wow, he is really hauling.

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:43.869
Oh, he stopped.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:47.411
- He's eating a pretzel.
- Barry is right, I'm going to get her.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:50.873
Wait, it's bumper to bumper
to the airport. Whoa, almost took off.

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:53.960
My gosh, you're right.
It's rush hour, I'll never make it.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:56.795
I can get you there.
I'm the fastest animal in the zoo.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:59.010
Plus, I fit in the bike Lane. Hop on.

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.760
Hop off, hop off.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.481
New plan. Follow me.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:11.689
Griffin, I got your back, baby.

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:17.278
Wait, where you going?

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:21.157
Hey, Griffin, you nut.
What are you doing back there?

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:25.537
- Nothing, everything is fine.
- Can't be in that area, it's unauthorized.

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:28.039
A guy inside said it's okay.
They will allow it.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.587
Listen, having a party Saturday,
a blowout.

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.919
Sounds good, I'm there.
I love blowouts.

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.000
- It's gonna be wild.
- I'll see you.

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:37.256
- Where you going, Griffin?
- Hey, get out.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:40.431
- I can do this.
- Wait, don't leave.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.683
- Okay.
- Can't you hear what I'm saying?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.185
Hey, Griffin! I'm saying... 

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:10.831
hey.

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.840
Hang on a second.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:26.097
Where are you going?
Can't leave me here.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.929
I'm out of the zoo without my izod.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.019
Griffin, what a surprise.

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:33.650
Hi, Mrs. d.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:40.364
Hey.

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:46.621
Ma!

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.037
- Take a cookie, sweetie.
- Oh, thanks, Mrs. d.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.497
Ma!

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:05.887
- Come on, the road's blocked.
- Yeah, oh... 

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.685
how about this?
I'll go around the back.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:26.157
Come on. What do we do?

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:32.371
Oh, you... 

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.707
you know what?
A heads up would be nice.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.872
Go, I'll meet you there.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:48.387
Kate!

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.937
Wait, stop!

01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:55.599
Kate!

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:58.401
Oh, God, she's gone.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.779
- It's over.
- It's not over.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.367
Get in.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.254
- Stay in sync.
- I'm trying.

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:19.502
Your arms are twice as long as mine.

01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:23.677
Hurry, we gotta out her off at the bridge
or she's gone.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.008
Row, gorilla, row.

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:29.801
Come on, use those big arms, baby.
Now we're doing it.

01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:32.685
Row, row, row.

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:41.812
Bernie.

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:48.819
I was kind of hoping
we'd see some steps.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.737
- Get on.
- What?

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:53.202
- Get on my back.
- Okay.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:03.508
You know what?

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:06.420
I don't think I can do this.
I'm afraid of heights.

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.133
- Oh, no.
- Don't look down.

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:12.471
- That's not helping.
- Don't look up.

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:17.022
Bernie, I'm looking down.
This is not good, give me your hand.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:39.540
There she is.

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:48.882
Hurry, she's on the move.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:52.348
What are you stopping for?

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:56.432
Just be yourself, Griffin.
That's all you need to do.

01:31:56.594 --> 01:31:59.848
- Now go get your girl.
- How?

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:08.906
- Griffin?
- Kate, hey.

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:11.443
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:14.203
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was cartwheeling.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.830
What? _i__

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:17.036
oh, you said... 

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:19.951
- you said eagles, they mate for life.
- Yes.

01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:23.839
Well, when an eagle finds
it's perfect mate, they cartwheel, right?

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:28.844
That's what they do. They lock their
talons together and spin out of control.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:32.844
And just before they hit the ground,
they break apart.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.810
The only difference
between me and an eagle is...

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:39.308
I will hit the ground
as you've just seen.

01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:45.606
You said you were done
with the zoo game.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.939
I thought I had to change
who I was to be happy...

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:50.482
But I was wrong.

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:56.663
Kate, it took me five years to get over
someone I wasn't even in love with.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:00.166
I can't imagine how long it would take
to get over you.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:05.710
And on a side note, I may have
crushed an ostrich getting here.

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:10.427
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:27.902
- He's fine, he's... 
- No, no.

01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:30.063
Yeah, we should get him back,
we should.

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:04.189
Wait a sec.
What the heck is benihana?

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.650
You still got your izod?

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:49.893
Get it.

01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:54.735
I can't get it off.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.109
I don't know what that was.

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:03.415
Share the road. You all right?

01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:11.043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:54.962
What is he doing?

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:56.918
That's a crazy stance right there.

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:01.051
You don't stay- you... 

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.592
I mean, you just stay,
don't go anywhere.

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.539
Yeah, baby.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.371
Okay, that... 

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:33.876
whoa, man, I feel like I went
through a car wash right then.

01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:38.380
All right, all right, be careful.
