WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:11.970
(in French accent):
Someday soon,
France will rule the globe.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.930
(speaking French)

00:14.013 --> 00:19.978
Finally...
the entire world will
have access to good bread.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.397
Really good bread.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.067
(speaking French)

00:27.694 --> 00:30.280
(ominous music playing)

00:30.363 --> 00:31.072
Black Pete:
But it was too late.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.785
(shouts):
Blackbeard!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.704
(all shouting)

00:37.787 --> 00:41.082
Blackbeard was upon 'em.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.042
-Whoa!
-Black Pete:
History's greatest pirate...

00:44.586 --> 00:45.712
and my former boss.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.090
(intense choral music plays)

00:54.387 --> 00:55.388
No, no, no, no.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.894
(gravelly voice):
Look into the eyes
of Blackbeard.

01:00.977 --> 01:05.982
Wait, wait, so you're
saying Blackbeard's head...
is made of smoke?

01:06.065 --> 01:07.650
When he needs it to be.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.652
-(pirates groan)
-Wow.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.404
And his eyes glow?

01:12.238 --> 01:12.822
Yes.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.116
But do his eyes also float?

01:15.200 --> 01:18.703
-'Cause his head is smoke.
-I never said that they floated.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.832
-And how big are they?
-Uh, they're just
regular eyes, but, uh...

01:22.916 --> 01:24.209
You guys getting this?

01:24.292 --> 01:27.128
-Pirates: Mmm.
-Wow.

01:27.212 --> 01:27.420
Anyway...

01:27.504 --> 01:29.631
(grunts)

01:29.714 --> 01:32.133
that's when
I leapt into action.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.635
(grunting)

01:37.013 --> 01:38.431
(yelling)

01:39.766 --> 01:41.100
-Ahh!
-(splash)

01:41.184 --> 01:44.187
Black Pete: And then,
Blackbeard was like...

01:44.270 --> 01:47.649
You saved my hide, Pete.
I am forever in your debt.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.777
Just happy to be
on the team, Blackbeard.

01:50.860 --> 01:55.198
From this day onward,
you'll be known as
the Dread Black Pete,

01:55.281 --> 01:57.534
my right-hand man.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.578
Oh, wow, imagine that.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.746
(pirates groan, laugh)

02:01.830 --> 02:04.833
I was with him
until the flip.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.835
We're not calling you
the Dread Black Pete.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.796
Wait... who's
steering the ship?

02:09.879 --> 02:14.342
-(loud creaking)
-(all shouting)

02:16.135 --> 02:19.347
(intense classical music plays)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.145
(grunting)

02:27.981 --> 02:30.066
-Did it move?
-No, Cap'n.

02:30.149 --> 02:32.694
Ugh, really?
Not even a little?

02:32.777 --> 02:35.405
We may need to start
eatin' some of the crew.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.906
I recommend
we start with Lucius.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.783
He's young
and succulent, huh?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.702
What?! Buttons...

02:40.785 --> 02:43.580
we've just run aground.
Happens to everyone.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.790
We don't need to start
eating each other.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.209
Aye, no, no,
of course not.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.753
Not until...
absolutely necessary.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.755
It won't be necessary.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.550
-Won't be necessary.
-No.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.385
Until it's
absolutely necessary.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.094
-Which it won't be.
-No.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.264
Please,
assemble the crew.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.098
We'll figure it out.

03:02.181 --> 03:02.223
All right, Cap'n.

03:07.103 --> 03:07.145
(grunting)

03:09.022 --> 03:12.442
Ooh...
Please move.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.529
Bolloxed this one up well
and good, eh, Baby Bonnet?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.365
You're dead,
and I'm not listening.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.992
(mocking):
Little Baby Bonnet broke

03:21.075 --> 03:23.119
his little baby boat
on the big bad beach.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.913
-Fat-ass.
-What?!

03:24.996 --> 03:25.830
-I'm not even fat.
-(restrained laugh)

03:25.914 --> 03:28.791
Fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat

03:28.875 --> 03:32.545
with your stupid, fat face,
and your oily, fat head.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.923
(inhales)
Well, at least I'm alive.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.468
You're a child with a toy.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.303
Who's now a murderer.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.347
-Murdering little--
-(yells): Enough!

03:45.683 --> 03:47.518
As many of you have noticed,

03:47.602 --> 03:50.271
we have run aground...
a little bit.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.982
-Are we gonna have
to eat each other?
-Most likely, aye.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.817
No, no, we have plenty of food.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.862
-For now.
-For weeks.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.741
We can eat for weeks,
so there's no need
to eat each other.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.743
I'd like to view this
as a holiday of sorts.

04:03.826 --> 04:07.497
(puzzled chatter)

04:07.580 --> 04:08.873
You know, a vacation.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.125
What the hell's
a vacation?

04:11.209 --> 04:14.754
Oh, well, it's a,
it's a period of leisure.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.007
Your time is yours
to do with as you please.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.010
Perhaps, there's
a hobby you enjoy.

04:21.094 --> 04:21.970
Or maybe you
do nothing at all.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.348
The point is
to rest our bodies...

04:28.601 --> 04:30.019
as well as our minds.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.105
What is
the punishment
if we don't?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.982
No, there's no punish--

04:34.065 --> 04:36.859
Look, there's literally
no way to mess this up.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.988
Just hit the beach,
rest, and have fun.

04:41.406 --> 04:41.447
Okay.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.911
Can my vacation be
torturing the hostages?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.872
I was thinking
more along the lines
of relaxing activities.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.709
Oh, I do find torturing
hostages relaxing.
Particularly this lot.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.711
(hostages muttering)

04:54.794 --> 04:57.255
I'll just take them
to the brink of death.
I won't go all the way.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.467
Let's say no to torture.
I think. For now.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.553
I think perhaps
take them for a walk?

05:03.636 --> 05:07.098
Air them out.
They are smelling a bit.
Not your fault.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.643
Why not...
uh, bake 'em a pie,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.353
and, and give 'em
back rubs?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.856
-Oh, is that what
Blackbeard would do?
-No!

05:14.939 --> 05:17.108
He'd stick hot pokers
up their assholes!

05:17.191 --> 05:18.359
-Ooh!
-Ooh, yeah, yeah.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.069
Right, just the walk.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.322
Thank you, though.
Have fun!

05:23.364 --> 05:24.532
Roach: Yeah, go!

05:24.615 --> 05:27.702
Oh, Oluwande, Jim.
Can I have a word?

05:29.537 --> 05:32.290
I'm having a bit of a hard time
adjusting to being a mur--

05:35.084 --> 05:37.837
-a mur--
-Spit it out,
you stuttering imbecile.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.090
Mur-der-er.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.718
-A murderer.
-Oluwande: Eh?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.595
You're not really
a murderer though,
are you?

05:45.678 --> 05:49.432
I mean, you was,
you was sort of...
around when he died.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.810
No, no, you're right
to protect me.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.148
But I callously and wantonly
took a man's life.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.068
And now I have
to live with it.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.654
But how does one...
move past such a thing?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.788
What's he saying?

06:11.871 --> 06:17.085
He says you don't.--
You know, when you kill,
y-you die as well.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.089
-(clinks)
-(grunts)

06:21.172 --> 06:22.381
(grunting)

06:22.465 --> 06:23.966
Good one.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.261
Hey, guys!
What on Earth
are you doing?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.181
-We're doing vacations.
-We're unwinding.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.476
That is not what
I was talking about!

06:33.559 --> 06:34.602
(chuckles)

06:36.062 --> 06:38.773
Right.
What are we doin' then?

06:38.856 --> 06:40.149
Should we hit the beach?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.318
Eh, I have a wax nose
and a fake beard,

06:42.401 --> 06:46.197
-so, uh, that'll kinda
be like torture.
-Yeah.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.491
(clears throat)
I'd absolutely murder
someone for a bath.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.409
I am starting to smell
like the rest of you.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.996
Oh, Captain has a tub.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.455
If you want,
I can, I can watch.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.416
Um, keep watch

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
-like by the door.
-No, I, yeah, I, I know.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.169
-So no one comes in.
-Jim: I know what you meant.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.131
-I, I, I, yeah. Mm-hm.
-Yeah.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.093
Um...

07:07.176 --> 07:08.636
-maybe we do our
own things today?
-Yep.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.138
-Yep, cool. Sweet.
-Let's do that.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.015
Um, um, yeah.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.020
Fuck off.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.273
Okay, come on.
Let's try a more
calm activity.

07:20.356 --> 07:24.193
Like lying flat
on the beach in the sun.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.863
Or, maybe I'll go
and check the gunpowder?

07:26.946 --> 07:30.324
Or, Wee John, you can
just leave the gunpowder
alone for today.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.451
Eh, I'm gonna go check it.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.537
-Captain!
-Roach.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.038
Need some
clarification:

07:36.122 --> 07:38.708
Are the hostages
also on vacation?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.668
They wish! No.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.712
Prisoners don't
get vacation.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.965
-So, they can't do
whatever they want then?
-Captain Stede: No, no, no, no.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.092
Roach: Ah.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.265
Roach... where are
the hostages right now?

07:54.348 --> 07:57.226
They requested to take
a pee, in private.

07:59.562 --> 07:59.854
Captain Badminton:
Pathetic.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.733
(laughing)

08:03.816 --> 08:04.901
(retching blood)

08:08.070 --> 08:09.697
I'm forming
a small search party

08:09.780 --> 08:13.409
to retrieve the hostages
from their pee.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.870
Oluwande has
agreed to join me.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.455
And I need
one more volunteer.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.584
Black Pete?

08:21.667 --> 08:26.214
Having Blackbeard's former
right-hand man along would
be a tremendous asset.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.798
Yeah, right.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.510
Can't argue with that.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.514
All right.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.141
This way.

08:37.225 --> 08:41.395
Captain Stede:
Blackbeard's murdered quite
a few individuals, hasn't he?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.772
Damn right.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.440
How does he process that?
Did he ever say?

08:44.524 --> 08:48.903
When Blackbeard kills
man, woman, or child

08:48.986 --> 08:50.738
he just gets
on with it.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.114
It's like
breathing for him.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.282
Wait,
he kills children?

08:53.366 --> 08:57.995
Well, it has to be
a really bad kid.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.123
-He's not a bloody monster.
-Oh, leave it.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.292
You know you're
the only one that believes
he's worked for Blackbeard?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.127
-No, really?
-All right.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.546
I've had about all
I'm gonna take of that.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.132
-Yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?
-Okay.

09:10.216 --> 09:10.967
-I'll show you what
I'm gonna do about it.
-We're losing focus.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.426
-Babyface.
-Let's just keep walking.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.803
-Hey! Don't!
-Don't fucking call me babyface.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.929
-He's callin' me babyface.
-Babyface, babyface.

09:15.012 --> 09:15.930
Well, Olu,
don't take the bait.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.306
(screaming)

09:17.390 --> 09:20.726
-Captain Stede: Ah! No, no!
-Oh my god!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.478
-Help!
-Stop shouting.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.938
Help!

09:25.648 --> 09:27.692
(cheering and laughing)

09:29.235 --> 09:30.486
What are you whittling?

09:30.569 --> 09:33.531
This... will eventually
be a harpsichord.

09:35.032 --> 09:35.992
Really?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.285
(loud boom)

09:37.368 --> 09:39.578
I love vacation!

09:39.662 --> 09:42.873
No, it kinda resembles
a sharp carrot.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.918
Wanna wager I can name
a thousand different
sea creatures?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.503
-Um, I'm not--
-Starfish!

09:48.337 --> 09:49.380
Sea bass.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.758
-Wild Alaskan salmon.
-(loud explosion)

09:52.842 --> 09:54.468
-Pufferfish. Spiny fish.
-Fuck the beach!

09:54.552 --> 09:58.931
Pomatomus saltatrix
which is Latin for bluefish.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.726
You got your tigerfish, dogfish.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.355
Other kinds of jellyfish.
Don't wanna get stang
by one of them.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.106
Send you into
a tunnel of despair...

10:07.189 --> 10:10.109
(tense music playing)

10:12.445 --> 10:15.823
What kind of fuckin' idiot
runs his ship aground?

10:18.784 --> 10:22.997
And this lot managed to take
English officers hostage.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.415
Word is, yeah.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.541
Fang:
Spotted 'em on deck

10:25.625 --> 10:26.876
before they
ran aground.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.794
Those hostages will
fetch a pretty penny.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.632
Let's take a closer look.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.639
(Bonifacia speaking)

10:58.407 --> 11:01.243
(Spanish guitar playing)

11:12.880 --> 11:13.673
Fuck it.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.471
(Spanish guitar continues)

11:38.572 --> 11:40.699
Dugongs, noodlefish,

were deserted.

It is, mostly.

We're merely
humble wanderers

in your party?

fill us in on what's
happening here, please?

-Anyone?
-You're in a cage.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.495
-Oh, you speak English.
Wonderful.
-Mm.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.622
Look, there's been
a misunderstanding.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.833
We're actually
looking for our hostages.

you'd eaten them.

Fucking racist.

-Mm-mm, you're too kind.
I'm good. Thank you.

-They made you a drink?

13:06.535 --> 13:09.538
Yeah, it's like a rum,
pineapple, coconut thing.
