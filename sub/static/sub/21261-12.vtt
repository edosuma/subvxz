WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.337
Previously on Salvation...

00:03.371 --> 00:05.173
Atlas is a weapons program.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
TANZ:
Except the weapon

00:06.440 --> 00:07.741
was an asteroid.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.177
President Mackenzie prepared

00:09.210 --> 00:10.411
an address to the nation.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.679
I'm gonna find out

00:11.712 --> 00:12.746
what she never got to say.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.582
If Atlas was
the story of the year,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.350
Samson's the story
of the century.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.785
TANZ:
The gravity tractor,

00:17.818 --> 00:19.053
it'll be one of
the greatest triumphs

00:19.087 --> 00:20.754
in scientific history.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.822
The savior of mankind.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.824
Now we can celebrate.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.360
LIAM: Your gravity tractor
doesn't respond to commands.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.662
Well, the question is,
is this a glitch...

00:28.696 --> 00:30.064
or a hack?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.799
I think whatever
circles your son's

00:31.832 --> 00:34.268
been trafficking in,
he's brought Zoe into the fold.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.704
Do you have any idea who
the hell you're dealing with?

00:36.737 --> 00:37.838
My father.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.207
HARRIS:
I'm not here to lecture you,

00:39.240 --> 00:40.408
I'm here to warn you.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.276
(beeping)
They're coming for you.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.679
What I'm about to tell you all

00:45.713 --> 00:47.615
will cause some concern.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.783
I can assure you that...

00:49.817 --> 00:51.085
HARRIS:
Get the medic.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.320
Turn those cameras off, now!

00:52.353 --> 00:53.721
Harris, open your eyes,
you've been played.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.722
BENNETT:
I, Monroe Bennett,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.457
do solemnly swear

00:56.490 --> 00:57.725
that I will faithfully
execute the office,

00:57.758 --> 00:59.860
so help me God.
HARRIS:
Grace,

00:59.893 --> 01:02.163
something's rotten
at the highest levels.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.831
So what are you gonna do?

01:03.864 --> 01:05.866
Whatever I have to.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.801
Whatever it takes.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.369
(computer buzzing)

01:41.402 --> 01:42.770
Whoa, take a
look at this.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.438
What the hell is that?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.447
(cell phone vibrating)

02:06.827 --> 02:08.329
JILLIAN:
Liam, what are you doing?

02:08.362 --> 02:09.663
I got a ping.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.266
JILLIAN:
A ping?

02:12.300 --> 02:14.702
What does it mean?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.304
I don't know yet.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.739
I need to find Darius now.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.846
Tess, you're certain,
Faraday One was the last

02:25.879 --> 02:27.881
of our sat-array systems
to have contact

02:27.915 --> 02:29.217
with the gravity tractor?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.818
TESS:
Yes, Darius.

02:30.851 --> 02:31.952
Okay.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.854
(blows air through cheeks)

02:33.887 --> 02:36.224
Replay the sequence.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.934
There must be a way
to regain control

02:46.967 --> 02:48.236
of the gravity tractor.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.803
Think, Darius, think.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.339
A firewall to breach,
some way in.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.207
I'm sorry, Darius.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.877
We've exhausted all options
at this time.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.712
Tess, bring up the 160.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.814
Current status.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.651
Candidates for the Salvation,
loading.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.821
Narrow the field
to... my personal selects.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.290
Loading.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.123
(footfalls approaching)

03:11.925 --> 03:13.193
LIAM: Darius, you
need to see this.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.797
(typing)

03:16.830 --> 03:19.633
(door opens)

03:19.667 --> 03:21.669
(door closes)

03:22.703 --> 03:24.938
(floorboards creak)

03:37.285 --> 03:39.019
(door opens)

03:39.052 --> 03:41.021
Mom!
(gasps)

03:41.054 --> 03:43.791
Oh, my God, Zoe. Zoe.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.926
Oh, I was so worried.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.629
Where have you been?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.698
RASMUSSEN: It is with
great regret and sorrow

03:50.731 --> 03:52.666
I must inform you all
that President Mackenzie

03:52.700 --> 03:54.001
had a hemorrhagic stroke,

03:54.034 --> 03:55.769
which unfortunately
proved fatal.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.905
As her personal physician
for the last decade,

03:57.938 --> 03:59.440
it is with great sadness

03:59.473 --> 04:01.909
that I must confirm her passing.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.378
(reporters clamoring)

04:08.382 --> 04:09.717
That I must confirm her passing.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.553
(reporters clamoring)

04:14.555 --> 04:15.789
(cell phone vibrates)

04:21.995 --> 04:24.465
LIAM:
Right, that's Samson.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.535
ETA to Earth impact
less than 129 days,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.069
but look at this.
This speck right here.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.406
It collided with Samson
47 minutes ago.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.907
Space debris hits
our asteroid.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.942
Wh-What are the odds?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.744
.0001 percent.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.045
I probably left out a few zeros.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.547
So, what happened?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.881
That's just it, nothing.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.916
No, no, based
on composition,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.985
rotation speed,

04:45.018 --> 04:46.954
and point of impact,
it should have done something.
I know.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.622
I know, which means...

04:48.656 --> 04:52.626
Our basic suppositions
about Samson have been faulty.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.964
I'll be back.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.766
Where are you going
at 4:00 a.m.?

04:58.799 --> 05:02.736
This may be the answer
to everything.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.982
Dylan protected me, kept me
out of what he was doing.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.586
But he stayed loyal
to his cause.

05:18.619 --> 05:22.089
He said some things
were worth dying for.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.924
That was the last time we spoke.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.394
He didn't make it, sir.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.997
(exhales)

05:30.030 --> 05:32.933
Thank you.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.704
Thank you for letting
me know how he was...

05:36.737 --> 05:38.005
at the very end.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.043
(whispering):
Harris, there's more.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.446
(sniffles)

05:45.479 --> 05:48.015
RE/SYST...

05:48.048 --> 05:49.950
they're planning something.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.118
Dylan said that?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.753
No.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.056
But I overheard him and Naomi
talking to someone.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.091
They were
really deferential

05:58.125 --> 05:59.893
like it was their boss.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.829
They called him Nero.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.966
(knock at door)

06:07.968 --> 06:11.472
Are you expecting someone else
at 4:30 in the morning?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.373
Zoe, go upstairs now.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.781
Grace.
Don't tell me to put
the gun down, Harris,

06:20.814 --> 06:21.815
or to give it to you.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.518
This is my house and
no one's coming in ever again

06:24.552 --> 06:25.553
unless I say so.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.488
Okay.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.662
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.531
Sorry, I tried calling. Uh...

06:37.565 --> 06:39.633
(exhales)

06:39.667 --> 06:43.537
I hope I'm not interrupting.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.206
HARRIS:
No.
No.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.642
Ironically, I was gonna
ask you to talk to him.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.478
Saves me the extra step.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.645
I have new information.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.846
It can't wait.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.648
Initially, we thought

06:54.682 --> 06:56.850
Samson was made of silicates,
porous rock,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.652
but the collision
this evening suggests

06:58.686 --> 06:59.853
it has an iron core.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.888
It's much denser

07:00.921 --> 07:02.155
than what we thought.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.124
Significance to the lay people?

07:04.157 --> 07:08.228
Space debris twice the size
and mass of the gravity tractor

07:08.261 --> 07:09.830
hit Samson head-on.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.732
The debris
vaporized on impact.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.966
The asteroid
didn't even blink.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.735
GRACE:
So, the government's plan

07:14.768 --> 07:17.237
to smash the asteroid into
pieces with a gravity tractor

07:17.270 --> 07:18.506
won't do a damn thing.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.107
Except destroy
the gravity tractor,

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
the one and only thing
that can save us.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.110
Harris, you need

07:23.143 --> 07:25.112
to get me a meeting
with the president now.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.747
I can't do that, Darius.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.116
Fine, then give me back control

07:29.149 --> 07:31.685
of the GT, which you
so ungraciously hijacked,

07:31.719 --> 07:32.753
no hard feelings--

07:32.786 --> 07:34.121
well, maybe a little--

07:34.154 --> 07:36.123
and I can go back to the
business of saving the world

07:36.156 --> 07:37.525
instead of destroying it.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.493
It wasn't me
who hijacked it.
Damn it, Harris.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.261
Haven't we played enough games?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.596
Darius, this is no game.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.831
This is a coup,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.766
orchestrated at
the highest levels,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.134
which I am trying to stop.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.509
You think President Mackenzie...

07:55.543 --> 07:57.177
was murdered?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.679
HARRIS:
Darius, the only way

07:58.712 --> 08:00.548
to regain control
of the gravity tractor

08:00.581 --> 08:03.016
is to regain control
of the country.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.886
How-how-how do you propose
we do that?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.190
By any means necessary.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.625
Are you in?

08:16.564 --> 08:19.232
Well, let's take
these bastards down.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.939
*

08:38.919 --> 08:40.888
Now, while I appreciate

08:40.921 --> 08:42.590
Mr. Tanz's conjecture,

08:42.623 --> 08:44.191
Dr. Strauss in Interplanetary
Defense thinks

08:44.224 --> 08:46.994
that the iron core theory
is speculative at best.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.930
And Tanz's remedy is to
conveniently restore

08:49.963 --> 08:51.264
the gravity tractor
to his control.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.901
And divert the asteroid,
saving everyone.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.636
Isn't that what we want?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.304
Harris, we all know

08:57.337 --> 08:58.939
Chelyabinsk
was a necessity.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.711
Yes, we knocked out
Russia's space warfare

09:03.744 --> 09:04.978
R & D facility.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.179
Jointly funded by the Chinese.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.581
CLAIRE: They were
only months away

09:07.615 --> 09:08.916
from having
next-gen satellite

09:08.949 --> 09:10.818
jammers and high-powered
microwave guns,

09:10.851 --> 09:13.821
designed to take out
our defense systems.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.188
If we hadn't made
that bold move,

09:15.222 --> 09:16.924
Russia and China
would have already destroyed

09:16.957 --> 09:18.992
our entire infrastructure.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.695
The future of democracy depends
on whoever wins the space race,

09:21.729 --> 09:25.232
and right now, finally,
we can ensure that victory.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.668
With Samson knocking out
our enemies.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.871
We are either the duck
or the hunter.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.773
It's either us or them.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.042
Can I assume that
we're all in agreement here?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.010
Stay the course.
Yes, sir.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.211
But...

09:38.245 --> 09:39.947
we all know
Darius Tanz won't stop

09:39.980 --> 09:41.348
until he gets what he wants.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.351
Can we be certain the gravity
tractor signal is secure?

09:44.384 --> 09:47.020
Dr. Strauss is managing things
from a high security,

09:47.054 --> 09:48.355
off-site location.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.389
Which is where, exactly?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.624
BENNETT:
You defend the country.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.160
He'll defend the planet.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.067
Strauss's terminal.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.069
Tell Darius it's got direct
links to U.S. battleships

10:02.102 --> 10:03.203
and destroyers
off the East Coast.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.740
It's the only place he could be
controlling the GT from.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.342
You're gonna need to
restore my A4 clearance.
Grace.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.045
This requires a mass hack
of the Pentagon.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.047
Your fingerprints
can't be anywhere near it.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.749
No, yours can't.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.784
(sighs)

10:16.817 --> 10:19.086
I said whatever it takes,
Harris. I meant it.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.296
Liam.
I'm working on it, sorry.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.297
Yes, wha... uh...

10:32.332 --> 10:34.301
(sighing):
What time is it?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.303
Time to stop drooling.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.271
I need you to take care
of something for me.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.372
Where are we with the 160?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.440
Uh...

10:40.473 --> 10:42.175
Jillian's curating all the data.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.144
She had 147 cleared candidates.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.378
She's almost ready.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.415
This envelope contains
additional names.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.317
My personal selections.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.452
I want them put through
all the genetic testing

10:52.485 --> 10:54.421
and psych profile analysis.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.323
Today.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.303
Claire.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.708
A moment of your time?

11:14.742 --> 11:17.911
I've been thinking
about you,

11:17.945 --> 11:19.847
since the other night.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.751
When... can I see you again?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
How about tonight?

11:27.755 --> 11:31.358
I'd like that, Mr. Secretary.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.126
(inhales, exhales)

11:33.160 --> 11:37.798
Bennett's approach
may seem extreme,

11:37.831 --> 11:41.334
but he's the only one with the
strength to get us through this.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.370
This is about survival.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.739
We have to do whatever it takes.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.247
And I will.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.824
Sorry, I got to run out.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.060
Where are you off to?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.096
Doctor's appointment.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.332
(door closes)

12:13.533 --> 12:17.337
At first I thought this was
a simple substitution code,

12:17.370 --> 12:19.372
like a Caesar cipher
or a rail cipher.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.809
But...?

12:21.842 --> 12:24.211
Looks more like a book cipher.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.014
Each number would correspond
to a word in a book.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.415
For example,
if I'm right,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.050
nine, eight, two
would correspond to page nine,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.819
line eight, second word.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.222
So in order to break the code,
I need to know which book.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.324
Which is why it's important
to know who wrote the code,

12:37.357 --> 12:38.491
and what books
they'd have access to.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.030
So...

12:43.063 --> 12:45.899
who wrote it?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.467
Todd, you work for the NSA.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.269
You're the last person
I'm sharing secrets with.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.779
(door opens)

13:02.615 --> 13:04.251
Mr. Secretary?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.452
Dr. Rasmussen.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.920
I went to your office.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.256
They told me
you were taking some time off.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.159
The president's death has taken
a toll on me to say the least.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.961
To be expected.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.595
You were her longtime physician,
from before she was president.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.031
Yes.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.968
You reported the official cause
of death was hemorrhagic stroke,

13:21.001 --> 13:23.971
but she was buried
without an autopsy.

13:24.004 --> 13:27.607
President McKenzie's maternal
family were observant Jews.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.510
Jewish law forbids anything
that desecrates a corpse.

13:30.543 --> 13:34.147
Did you notice signs of
impairment prior to the stroke?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.583
We ran blood panels, did
a cerebral angiogram.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.319
Nothing unusual turned up,
we chalked it up to fatigue,

13:39.352 --> 13:40.520
but she wouldn't slow down.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.389
And where are those
blood samples now?

13:42.422 --> 13:45.525
I gave them everything
I had, Mr. Secretary.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.460
Gave to whom?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.462
President Bennett's
secret service.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.464
They took it all,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.066
along with my files.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.902
Well, there's no record
of those tests,

13:54.935 --> 13:56.970
or blood samples, anywhere.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.138
Well, that's a matter
you'll have to take up

13:58.171 --> 13:59.206
with President Bennett.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.908
Now, if you don't mind,

14:00.941 --> 14:03.543
I was just on my way to pick up
my son from soccer practice.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.045
Is it possible
President's Mackenzie's health

14:05.078 --> 14:06.446
could've been compromised?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.847
I said what you all
wanted me to say.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.953
So please leave me
and my family alone.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.387
Dr. Rasmussen,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.289
if you know something...
I know nothing.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.557
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:17.590 --> 14:19.459
I really can't be late
for my son.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.596
(engine starts)

14:25.933 --> 14:28.301
JILLIAN (over video):
What skills would you contribute

14:28.335 --> 14:29.937
on a mission to Mars?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.172
As a botanist
who's dealt with drought

14:32.205 --> 14:35.308
in the Sub-Saharan desert,
I feel my skills...

14:35.342 --> 14:37.344
As a trauma surgeon
uniquely prepare me

14:37.377 --> 14:39.579
to deal with anything
and everything...

14:39.612 --> 14:40.948
That's required
to teach children

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
the history of our planet.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.617
So we don't repeat the mistakes
we've made here.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.923
Hey.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.925
How goes it?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.594
I'm just trying to fill
those last 13 slots.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.330
Darius wants to see
the group as a whole.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.333
I'm not gonna lie,
it's been hard.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.536
Well, this might help
fill out those last few seats.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.173
Darius's personal selects.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.408
He says he wants you and me
to vet them immediately.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.581
Jillian.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.363
(beeps)

15:30.397 --> 15:31.698
What is that?

15:31.731 --> 15:34.701
An NFC implantation device
of my own creation.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.569
Sorry, I don't speak tech.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.737
(laughs softly)

15:37.770 --> 15:38.705
Near-field communication.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.607
Think of it like a sponge.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.642
If it comes
within 30 centimeters

15:42.675 --> 15:44.477
of another device,
I can hack into it,

15:44.511 --> 15:47.447
and soak up some
very pertinent information.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.083
So this is how you'll infiltrate
the Pentagon servers.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.318
How you will.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.520
With no fingerprints.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.956
(exhales)

16:01.428 --> 16:03.330
I'm glad your daughter's okay.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.732
Me, too.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.501
Except she still wants
to go to Kenya.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.005
Don't you think it's time
to tell her?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.206
Yeah.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.676
I just don't know how.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.512
Love makes things complicated.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.649
It does.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.217
You're gonna
feel a slight...

16:24.251 --> 16:25.618
Ow.
...pinch.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.620
Sorry, I just implanted
a chip under your skin.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.024
Like the one you gave me
so I could find Salvation?

16:31.058 --> 16:33.226
Similar but upgraded.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.661
So I'm supposed
to hack

16:34.694 --> 16:37.364
into their mainframe
with my hand.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.767
Sometimes necessity
is the mother of deception.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.635
Just get to
the terminal

16:42.669 --> 16:45.405
Harris identified
and Tess will do the rest.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.575
Speaking of Tess.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.445
How did all that go?

16:52.479 --> 16:54.747
It went.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.317
(elevator doors open)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.687
Hey.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.155
What'd the doctor say?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.823
No autopsy.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.759
And Bennett's secret service
agents confiscated everything.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.095
Not a trace
of evidence to prove

17:08.128 --> 17:09.796
she was poisoned.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.598
President Mackenzie
took it all to the grave.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.801
So there's evidence; we
just need to dig it up.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.305
Zachary Taylor, 12th president.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.340
His remains were exhumed
a hundred years after he died

17:20.373 --> 17:21.741
to determine
whether he'd been poisoned.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.743
So it's not like
you're breaking new ground here.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.345
Pun intended.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.114
You're proposing
we dig up

17:27.147 --> 17:30.117
the dead body of the president
of the United States?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.751
You said whatever it takes.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.787
We're going to need a team.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.093
(Grace sighs)

17:40.793 --> 17:42.829
I know a guy.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.871
So, you're digging up
the president

17:51.904 --> 17:53.840
and hacking the Pentagon.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.510
Just wanted to make sure
we're all on the same page.

17:57.544 --> 18:01.281
Ooh. The good stuff.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.749
Ah. The best.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.317
All right.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.652
So you're gonna need
a team that knows

18:05.685 --> 18:07.620
how to get in and get out
of a casket, fast.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.290
That I can
help you with.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.458
In terms of access,
Arlington Cemetery,

18:11.491 --> 18:13.360
you're the secretary of defense,

18:13.393 --> 18:14.461
I think you have
that covered.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.428
How soon?

18:15.462 --> 18:17.364
Tonight.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.299
Rush job. Got it.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.768
I know some talented guys
who, uh, owe me a few favors.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.172
The sort who
understand discretion.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.307
Good.
You don't want to know
what all this is about?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.409
Too much information
can be dangerous.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.311
If you tell me you
need me, Gracie,

18:31.344 --> 18:32.512
that's all I need to know.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.481
Thanks, Dad.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.355
I'll be in touch.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.359
So that's your dad.

18:46.393 --> 18:50.297
What exactly did he do
for the CIA?

18:51.498 --> 18:55.368
I'm guessing everything.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.505
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention, all personnel...

18:58.538 --> 18:59.506
JILLIAN:
You know,

18:59.539 --> 19:01.374
I never really thought
about it.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.443
Whether or not
I wanted to go.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.379
I guess I've just been
in denial.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.449
Yeah, me, too.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.520
I just can't imagine
getting on the Ark

19:13.553 --> 19:15.355
without my dad.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.724
Or...

19:17.757 --> 19:19.459
What?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.393
No...

19:20.427 --> 19:22.562
What if only one of us can go?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.264
What are you talking about?

19:24.297 --> 19:28.601
I have no idea
who my biological parents are.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.802
I might be carrying
some genetic disease

19:29.836 --> 19:30.903
that I don't
even know about

19:30.937 --> 19:33.440
that would disqualify me.

19:33.473 --> 19:37.477
Well, whatever happens,
we're in this together.

19:37.510 --> 19:42.449
If it comes down to it,
we either both go or both stay.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.557
All for one.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.460
And one for all.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.404
Moby-Dick, not a match.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.472
Damn it.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.541
Any luck
with Mackenzie's speech?

20:08.575 --> 20:10.543
No. I'm working on it.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.844
Man, for all you know, it could
be a copy of Goodnight Moon

20:11.878 --> 20:13.246
she kept in the Lincoln Bedroom.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.515
No. Her speechwriter told me

20:15.548 --> 20:18.518
she was locked away in the
Oval Office for hours writing.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.019
It's got to be one
of these books.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.488
I just don't get it.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.989
Why does the president encode
her own speech?

20:23.022 --> 20:26.393
To keep whatever's
on this page secret.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.694
Until she was ready
to reveal it.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.430
(inhales, exhales)

20:36.436 --> 20:37.870
Listen to this:

20:37.904 --> 20:40.573
"Little known is that
the president keeps

20:40.607 --> 20:42.809
"Lincoln's copy
of the King James Bible

20:42.842 --> 20:45.011
in a desk drawer
in the Oval Office."

20:47.714 --> 20:50.016
Who's got a copy of the Bible?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.518
The King James Bible.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.752
(elevator bell chimes)

20:56.656 --> 20:58.591
(whispering):
Darius, are you with me?

20:58.625 --> 21:02.028
TANZ: Thanks to those contact
lenses, every step of the way.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.063
I'm with you.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.732
GRACE:
What about the eye scan?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
Those contacts

21:07.600 --> 21:09.602
shouldn't interfere.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.338
Shouldn't or won't?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.972
Shouldn't. Hopefully.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.674
Terrific.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.612
(beeps, door opens)

21:19.646 --> 21:20.613
(sighs)

21:20.647 --> 21:22.682
TANZ:
Ye of little faith.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.088
There.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.957
Strauss's workstation.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.393
Grace, you need
to distract Dexter.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.862
He'll be able to see
our connection on his monitor.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.497
Dexter?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.399
Secretary Edwards asked me
to put together

21:39.432 --> 21:41.668
an updated situation report.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.935
There was some minor activity
with Samson this morning,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.537
but it ended up
being insignificant.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.406
I'm still gonna need
the data for my report.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.507
Can you print that out, please?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.576
Sure.
Thank you.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.845
It's working, Grace.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.714
You're a master spinmeister.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.604
At ease, soldier.

22:17.637 --> 22:18.971
What's your current status?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.641
Standard security rotation,
Mr. Secretary, sir.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.742
Graveyard shift
till 0600.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.678
You have new orders.
Sir?

22:27.146 --> 22:28.748
The MP will see you and your men

22:28.781 --> 22:30.450
get to your new post
immediately.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.684
You're all relieved.

22:31.718 --> 22:32.619
Sir, yes, sir.

22:49.669 --> 22:53.005
Gentlemen, we've got
60 minutes, no more.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.956
(whispering):
Darius, how much time?

23:10.957 --> 23:11.991
TANZ:
Two minutes.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.760
Here's everything.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.161
Now, if you don't mind...

23:15.194 --> 23:18.698
(alarm buzzing)

23:18.731 --> 23:19.599
Grace, what's happening?

23:19.632 --> 23:21.668
Russian subs on the move.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.770
China, too.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.472
TECH:
The president's on his way.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.606
Grace, get out of there now.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.474
Not until we get what we need.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.175
Don't be stupid.
Bennett's too dangerous

23:29.208 --> 23:30.176
to play around with.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.778
How much to go?

23:31.811 --> 23:34.447
We have it all.
I don't believe you.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.783
Damn, it, Grace,
get out of there now.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.586
TECH: The President
of the United States.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.554
There's no time for protocol.
As you were.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.889
General Higgins and I need
a full report

23:42.922 --> 23:44.056
on all enemy positioning.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.025
As well as our allies
in the Pacific

23:46.058 --> 23:47.226
and Baltic regions.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.029
We can't afford
to get this wrong.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.631
Ms. Barrows.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.601
I thought your A4 security
clearance was revoked.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.803
The secretary reinstated it

23:56.836 --> 23:58.170
after our success with Russia.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.874
(beeps)
Grace, 100%.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.677
We've got what we need.

24:04.711 --> 24:05.912
BENNETT:
Ms. Barrows.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.584
Mr. President.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.057
I'm gonna need you to organize
a press conference right away.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.125
We have to make a statement.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.727
I'll get right on it, sir.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.994
BENNETT:
Claire, get our NATO friends

24:22.028 --> 24:23.129
on the phone immediately.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.832
And, Harris...

24:25.865 --> 24:27.534
Where's Harris, Edwards?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.902
Where the hell is
my secretary of defense?!

24:29.936 --> 24:32.772
Grace, get out of there now.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.845
(indistinct chatter)

24:54.193 --> 24:56.529
*

25:20.019 --> 25:21.854
Wormwood.

25:22.889 --> 25:23.756
Wormwood.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.958
What the hell is Wormwood?

25:25.992 --> 25:30.029
"Revelation 8: 10-11.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.799
"And the third angel sounded,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.034
"and there fell
a great star from the heaven.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.336
"burning as it were a lamp.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.173
And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

25:55.254 --> 25:58.891
"It is with great sadness
that I must reveal to you

25:58.925 --> 26:02.194
"a secret known only
to a few up until now.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.965
"Wormwood will collide with
Earth in 137 days,

26:05.998 --> 26:08.801
with the potential
to wipe out all life."

26:17.944 --> 26:19.946
(coughing, retching)

26:21.781 --> 26:23.683
(machine rumbling)

26:24.951 --> 26:26.953
How long do you need to
obtain a tissue sample?

26:26.986 --> 26:29.121
Once the casket's open,
two minutes tops.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.392
Mr. Secretary, I know she's
only been gone a few days,

26:33.425 --> 26:35.895
but it can be disturbing.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.804
More than you know.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.210
Well, that is disturbing.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.054
If the body's not here,
then where the hell is it?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.356
Where isn't as important
as the how and the why.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.258
Who stands to gain
from stealing

27:06.292 --> 27:07.660
a dead president's body?

27:07.694 --> 27:09.796
Someone trying to hide
how she died.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.130
One thing's for certain--

27:11.163 --> 27:12.431
whoever pulled this off

27:12.464 --> 27:14.667
must have had the help
of her secret service.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.405
Something I should know?
HARRIS: Not yet.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.309
I know the former head
of Mackenzie's detail.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.977
Someone we can trust?

27:25.011 --> 27:27.246
I thought so.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.016
Harris, remember,

27:30.049 --> 27:31.650
they have eyes everywhere.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.689
(phone vibrates)

27:41.460 --> 27:43.963
Thank you all for gathering
on such short notice,

27:43.996 --> 27:46.332
but events are
unfolding rapidly.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.435
(reporters clamoring)
Rather than answer
the same questions twice,

27:49.468 --> 27:51.871
I give you the President
of the United States.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.875
(camera shutters clicking)

27:55.908 --> 27:57.710
(all clamoring)

27:57.744 --> 27:59.178
I'll take your questions
after I've made a statement.

27:59.211 --> 28:02.181
Now, since this is only the
second week of my presidency,

28:02.214 --> 28:03.716
our adversaries might
be tempted to think

28:03.750 --> 28:06.285
that this is a good time
to test this nation.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.055
If they believe that
we are in disarray or weak,

28:09.088 --> 28:12.424
let me be absolutely clear
that they are sorely mistaken.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.127
(cell phone vibrates)
Now, our goal has
always been peace,

28:15.161 --> 28:17.063
but our patience
with the Russian regime is over.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.097
Threats and provocations

28:18.130 --> 28:20.199
will be met with
the strongest

28:20.232 --> 28:22.468
possible response.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.436
The policy of the United
States has always been

28:24.470 --> 28:25.872
and will continue to be...

28:25.905 --> 28:27.273
(phone vibrates)

28:30.777 --> 28:32.745
I'll take your questions.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.480
(reporters clamoring)

28:39.251 --> 28:41.287
(car door opens)

28:46.192 --> 28:48.427
(sighs)

28:48.460 --> 28:49.962
I'm not sure what
you think you know.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.330
I know everything, Grace.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.498
(scoffs)

28:52.531 --> 28:55.134
I know about the asteroid.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.236
We're facing an
extinction-level event.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.338
I cannot confirm that story.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.342
My God, Grace, you
can't just sit on this.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.078
I can't just sit on this.
People need to know.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.847
They have a right to know.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.081
Think through the consequences

29:09.115 --> 29:10.516
of publishing this story,
Amanda.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.818
There would be global panic,

29:11.851 --> 29:13.786
a complete breakdown
of law and order.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.854
Is that what you want?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.789
What I want is the truth.

29:16.823 --> 29:20.059
As a public servant,
you owe me that.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.261
Or did you forget you
worked for the public,

29:22.294 --> 29:24.263
Press Secretary Barrows?

29:24.296 --> 29:27.566
Look... off the record,

29:27.599 --> 29:28.835
there are plans.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.102
Either we'll solve
this problem

29:30.136 --> 29:31.938
and get on with our lives
in a few months,

29:31.971 --> 29:33.339
or we won't.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.440
But now is not the time
to unleash

29:34.473 --> 29:35.307
this secret on the world.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.343
The geopolitics are
extremely volatile.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.546
You have a moral
responsibility beyond career.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.316
This is not about career.
This is about...

29:46.552 --> 29:48.888
...the end of the world.

29:50.990 --> 29:55.227
Amanda... look at me.

29:55.261 --> 29:58.898
Once you get over
the shock, and you will,

29:58.931 --> 30:01.834
you'll realize this story
will cause more harm

30:01.868 --> 30:03.602
than good right now.

30:03.635 --> 30:07.306
President Mackenzie
didn't think so.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.909
She was about to tell
the world the truth

30:09.942 --> 30:11.143
before she died.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.313
How do you know that?

30:14.346 --> 30:16.448
Because I have
her speech.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.920
(sighs)

30:20.953 --> 30:23.990
I urge you to do
the sane thing.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.092
Once this genie is
out of the bottle,

30:26.125 --> 30:28.494
the entire world order
goes upside down.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.864
Please, think about that

30:31.898 --> 30:33.465
before you hit "send."

30:37.303 --> 30:40.439
Amanda, I was wrong
about you.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.975
You're a damn good reporter.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.957
I'm afraid the cat's
out of the bag

30:57.990 --> 30:59.625
with our reporter friend.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.094
You want us to deliver
another message?

31:02.128 --> 31:03.662
CLAIRE (over phone):
Take the necessary action.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.598
And this time, go the way
of our friend Carnahan.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.200
MAN:
Understood.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.912
(winces)

31:19.946 --> 31:21.647
Sorry.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.019
They're moving
submarines, Darius.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.120
(sighs)

31:28.154 --> 31:30.689
The Russians must have spotted
our GT when that debris

31:30.722 --> 31:32.258
made noise last night
in space.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.960
They know what
we're doing, so

31:33.993 --> 31:35.527
they're lining up allies.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.930
Amanda Neel's
got the story.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.399
It's only a matter of time
before she releases it.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.971
(sighs)

31:45.004 --> 31:46.105
I got to go home.

31:46.138 --> 31:49.041
I have to tell Zoe.

31:49.075 --> 31:52.945
I just hope it's not too late
for her to forgive me.

31:52.979 --> 31:57.483
It's never too late to be honest
with the people you love.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.104
You go first.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.040
No.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.941
No, no, no, we-we
do this together.
(sighs)

32:31.717 --> 32:33.319
(sighs)

32:33.352 --> 32:34.987
(both chuckle)

32:35.021 --> 32:36.522
(both sigh)

32:39.091 --> 32:40.559
(Jillian moans softly)

32:40.592 --> 32:43.029
(both sigh)

32:43.062 --> 32:44.396
(exhales sharply)

32:44.430 --> 32:45.664
All right.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.066
What about the others?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.654
Liam, what's the matter?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.529
(phone chimes)

33:28.074 --> 33:29.308
(inhales sharply)

33:32.144 --> 33:35.814
Zoe, I've kept
too many secrets from you.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.817
And I can't do it anymore.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.620
I need to tell you
what's happening

33:41.653 --> 33:44.523
so you can make
decisions for yourself.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.758
An asteroid was due
to hit the Earth...

33:46.792 --> 33:48.794
(continues speaking
indistinctly)

34:04.310 --> 34:05.577
Grant.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.546
Harris, what the hell?
Real slow.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.781
Sidearm, where I can see it.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.555
Have you gone crazy?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.290
Put that Beretta down.

34:18.324 --> 34:22.661
I need to know, where exactly is
the body of President Mackenzie?

34:22.694 --> 34:24.830
Because she seems to have
walked away from her casket.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.701
From your reaction,
it's clear you're not surprised.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.239
You were lead
on her detail.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.141
So either you're
derelict in your duty--

34:35.174 --> 34:36.608
and knowing you,
that's not likely--

34:36.642 --> 34:39.311
or you know exactly
what went down.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.280
So, where's
the president's body?

34:41.313 --> 34:42.614
I can't.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.483
(gun cocks)
Can't or won't?

34:44.516 --> 34:45.751
Harris,

34:45.784 --> 34:49.155
I need to know what you know.

34:51.823 --> 34:54.293
Mackenzie died of something
other than natural causes.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.162
And you must have
aided and abetted.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.297
You got it all wrong, man.
I loved that woman.

34:58.330 --> 35:02.201
Then help me expose
whoever did this to her.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.804
You want to see the body?

35:08.907 --> 35:12.411
Put that gun away
and I'll take you there.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.913
TANZ: Tess, sift through
every outgoing signal

35:14.946 --> 35:16.715
recorded on this chip.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.219
Find the one that matches
our original EmDrive frequency

35:20.252 --> 35:22.221
and let me know
where that signal

35:22.254 --> 35:23.455
is being transmitted from.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.291
TESS:
Searching now.

35:25.324 --> 35:28.860
So, did you run the tests
I asked you to

35:28.894 --> 35:31.197
for the 160?

35:31.230 --> 35:34.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.767
And?

35:35.801 --> 35:37.636
Darius, the gravity tractor

35:37.669 --> 35:40.239
is being controlled
by the USS Pike,

35:40.272 --> 35:42.374
an aircraft carrier
currently located 200 miles

35:42.408 --> 35:44.610
off the Florida c-coast.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.245
(distorted):
N-not-- error.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.879
Tanz. Tess. Treehouse.

35:47.913 --> 35:48.814
Tess?

35:48.847 --> 35:50.782
MALE VOICE: Administration.
TESS: Data.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.818
(distorted): Protocol. Ark.
Sal-Salvation.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.786
Whoa, is Tess
having a stroke?

35:54.820 --> 35:58.324
Tess, force quit
all current processes.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.392
Tess, emergency reboot.
(Tess stutters)

36:00.426 --> 36:03.262
Authorization code:
Echo, bravo, one, one.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.963
Tess?
TESS (distorted):
Error, admin...

36:04.996 --> 36:07.399
What is this place?

36:07.433 --> 36:09.235
It's a nuclear
fallout shelter.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.570
Government built dozens of
them around D.C. in the '60s.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.206
All defunded decades ago
and forgotten about,

36:14.240 --> 36:17.309
but otherwise
completely intact.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.385
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

36:37.863 --> 36:42.200
(weakly):
Welcome, Mr. Secretary.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.447
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.616
I didn't know
who I could trust.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.987
Madame President,

37:02.020 --> 37:03.789
it's good to see you alive.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.592
Barely.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.794
The stroke.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.629
Was induced.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.431
By poison.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.665
RASMUSSEN:
Mercury.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.434
Someone added it
to her asthma inhaler.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.669
The more she used it,
the more she needed it.

37:17.703 --> 37:22.541
That's what was causing
my memory lapses.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.909
She's still not
out of the woods.

37:23.942 --> 37:24.876
I'll say.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.813
We're administering
chelation therapy

37:27.846 --> 37:29.648
to remove the toxins
from her bloodstream.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.450
We call ourselves...

37:32.751 --> 37:34.620
"the loyalists."

37:34.653 --> 37:35.754
MACKENZIE:
Thank you

37:35.787 --> 37:37.856
for saving my life.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.730
We diverted her at the hospital.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.401
The family declined autopsy
on religious grounds,

37:49.435 --> 37:52.738
and then you did a closed-casket
funeral to cover the tracks.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.442
We have to tell the world
she's alive

37:56.475 --> 37:58.610
and depose
this illegitimate regime.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.846
And if she was well enough
to address the nation,

38:00.879 --> 38:03.715
Bennett and his people
will do anything to stop her.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.651
They're not just gonna
walk away from this.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.586
If we don't reinstall her
in the next 24 hours,

38:07.619 --> 38:10.356
there may not be a world
to get her back to.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.562
You have to find out
who did this.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.829
Then prove it.

38:19.731 --> 38:20.932
CLAIRE: Madame President,
do you need to...?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.768
No, no, no.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.605
Trust me.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.808
I will.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.013
(electrical buzzing, sparking)

38:35.046 --> 38:36.582
I'm completely locked out.

38:36.615 --> 38:37.649
Has this ever
happened before?

38:37.683 --> 38:39.651
No.

38:39.685 --> 38:40.552
Programs fail
all the time.

38:40.586 --> 38:43.355
Tess hasn't failed,
she's being attacked.

38:43.389 --> 38:47.693
There's always a way in, but
this time I opened the gates.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.060
This is RE/SYST.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.562
It can't be anyone else.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.832
When they helped us create
that blackout in Russia,

38:53.865 --> 38:55.501
they must've slipped in
a ghost key.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.668
Which means they've
been in our system

38:56.702 --> 38:58.704
since we launched
the gravity tractor,

38:58.737 --> 38:59.971
monitoring our every move.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.707
(sighs)

39:01.740 --> 39:03.975
Waiting for an opportunity
to attack.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.678
Oh, Darius, they must...

39:06.712 --> 39:07.746
they must know...

39:07.779 --> 39:09.748
Everything.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.121
Once shut down,

39:16.154 --> 39:18.624
there's no telling
the damage that will be done.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.125
She might
never recover.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.662
But right now...

39:24.863 --> 39:26.565
...this is the only move
we have.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.505
I'm sorry, Daddy,
I had to tell her.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.140
And you.

39:36.842 --> 39:40.078
And Zoe's sure
this is what she wants?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.913
Yeah.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.415
What about you, Gracie?

39:44.883 --> 39:45.884
What do you want?

39:47.686 --> 39:50.789
You never mentioned
you were in love.

39:50.822 --> 39:54.526
No, Harris and I... we're over.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.695
That's not who
I'm talking about.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.697
(footfalls approaching)

39:58.730 --> 40:01.833
Glad that I could see
my granddaughter off.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.202
Her first trip to Africa. Mm.
(chuckles)

40:04.235 --> 40:06.705
Please let me take you
to the airport.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.640
No, it's too much.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.808
Grandpa's taking me.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.710
I'll grab your stuff.
Thanks.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.848
(softly):
Hey.

40:18.684 --> 40:19.885
Sure about this?
(door closes)

40:19.918 --> 40:22.854
Maybe it seems pointless

40:22.888 --> 40:25.156
to try and bring a little love
and compassion into this world

40:25.190 --> 40:26.592
if it's all about to end...

40:26.625 --> 40:28.494
It's not pointless.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.895
It's the most important thing.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.869
You go do some good, okay?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.972
So will I.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.241
I love you, Mom.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.010
(crying):
To the moon.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.912
(laughs, sniffles)

40:59.758 --> 41:00.826
To the moon.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.963
And back.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.572
(door closes)

41:21.880 --> 41:24.482
*

41:29.154 --> 41:30.956
(sighs deeply)

41:30.989 --> 41:33.158
(typing)

41:35.226 --> 41:36.795
ED:
Hey.
(gasps)

41:37.829 --> 41:39.030
Geez, don't scare me like that.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.566
Sorry. I'm heading out
for the night

41:40.599 --> 41:41.867
and I'm just checking.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.735
You or your NSA friend
ever figure out

41:43.769 --> 41:45.303
how to decode
Mackenzie's speech?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.738
Uh...

41:48.574 --> 41:49.608
(alarm blaring)

41:49.641 --> 41:51.109
Crap.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.278
All right, people, quickly
move towards the stairs.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.813
Come on.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.548
Uh, I'll-I'll be right there.
Amanda.

41:56.582 --> 41:59.651
We have a false alarm
every other week.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.754
Let me back this up
just in case.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.292
(alarm continues blaring)

42:14.900 --> 42:16.935
(gasps)
Are you security guard?

42:17.903 --> 42:19.137
Yeah.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.842
Amanda?
What the hell is...?

42:24.142 --> 42:25.611
(grunts)
