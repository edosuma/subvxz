Hey, John, you know,
actually about Jesus,

00:07.925 --> 00:10.093
say hi to him for me, will you?

00:11.553 --> 00:12.638
It's him.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.890
- Did you see him?
- Who?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.184
- The guy in the viewing room.
- No.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.310
It was Dad.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
- Where's your girl?
- She'll be at my place in about an hour.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.732
Pretty soon, we're gonna call in our favor.

01:59.453 --> 02:03.123
But when she was 12, she got cancer,
so we had to put her down.

02:03.206 --> 02:07.377
And you'd think it would be this
big, dramatic event, but,

02:08.252 --> 02:10.547
it was very peaceful.

- Then we're ready.
- Almost.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.092
I know which pipes we need to take
beneath Psych Ward now.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.845
Which means our way to the Infirmary
is clear.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.974
With our new route, we're gonna come
up on the far end of that building.

No sweat. That's all we gotta do is
run a bump and grab on a CO

grab the keys, make a copy.

That depends.

You know, it's gonna take us forever

- Exactly.

So I figured, you know, I'd swipe it.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.783
I could get some party cash, you know?

15:10.493 --> 15:12.495
And there was one card in there.

15:14.831 --> 15:18.042
A 1910 Honus Wagner.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.928
This card, it was worth $300,000.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.683
So they slapped me with grand larceny.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.021

It's not as simple as that, trust me.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.827
I worked for them.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.789
You worked for them?
You're an alcoholic...

17:19.872 --> 17:23.041
Is that what you remember
or is that what you were told?

17:25.336 --> 17:27.128
Why'd you leave?

to appoint, what wars to fight.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.396
Thing is, if you wanted to rise in the ranks
like I did,

17:43.479 --> 17:46.399
you had to commit to leaving
everything you know behind.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.610
Because then you start to get access
to the real information.

17:49.694 --> 17:53.864

a lot of things to get their hands on,

18:02.123 --> 18:03.457
Why didn't you call us?

but I didn't have a choice.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.006
Lincoln, the day I left The Company,

18:11.382 --> 18:16.012
I took all that information with me.
That's why they're doing this to you.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.889
All of it, to stop me.

Look, I don't know what's going on.
I don't know why you're in there,

18:53.633 --> 18:57.261
but if there's one thing those guys
that brought me here taught me,

18:57.345 --> 19:02.016
is that if you fight, if you struggle,
you only make things worse.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.602
Stop fighting, Michael.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.352
in the middle of nowhere with a
population of 42.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.188
Blackfoot, Montana.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.410
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

20:06.330 --> 20:08.791
I thought you understood, Terrence.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.712
If you wanna talk, we set up a meeting,
at home, in person.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.090
I saw the latest tracking.
Your polls are headed south.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.634
<i>Maybe the Burrows thing is finally starting</i>

20:18.718 --> 20:22.596
to gain some traction with the swings.
It could hurt.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.057
- Goodbye, Terrence.
- You said it was almost over.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.475
It is.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.353
Are we talking about Lincoln Burrows

20:30.646 --> 20:32.022
or your candidacy?

20:32.106 --> 20:35.651
The only reason that you are still alive

20:35.735 --> 20:39.655
<i>-is because I won't let them kill you.
- Yeah.</i>

20:40.656 --> 20:45.286
I'm pretty clear on that.
But the thing I can't quite figure is,

20:45.369 --> 20:48.414
with the crap storm this thing's become,

20:49.999 --> 20:51.792
why they haven't killed you.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.315
(SIGHING)

21:37.671 --> 21:41.217
Figure out how you're gonna
get the key to the Infirmary yet?

21:42.468 --> 21:43.636
Not quite.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.597
You working a game on her, or what?

21:50.559 --> 21:51.894
I don't know.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.899
Hey man! Get out of my way!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.488
I've had time to think.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.492
Not that you tried to kill me,

22:06.575 --> 22:09.954
but about how Jesus saved me.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.170
I didn't come here, Theodore,
to inflict any more pain.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.507
Take my hand

22:22.258 --> 22:26.095
so we can put this behind us. Please.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.522
Show me the palm of your other hand.

22:38.399 --> 22:42.570
Don't insult me. After all that you've done,

22:44.071 --> 22:48.576
the least I ask is that you don't insult me.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.392
Does not a warm hand

23:14.310 --> 23:17.313
feel better than a cold shank?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.987
You got a point there, John. Yeah.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.491
Truce?

23:30.326 --> 23:32.912
You got it. Truce.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.014
Son of a bitch.
It's been two and a half hours

23:52.097 --> 23:54.099
and you're telling me that
sheriff has got nothing?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.851
I'm telling you the roads are blocked off.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.812
That Mustang's got to be somewhere
within those 10 square miles.

23:58.896 --> 24:02.524
All right, listen,
you got two hours to find him.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.944
After that, I have got to talk to the press.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.488
Hey, but there's an escaped killer
outside our walls

24:07.571 --> 24:10.032
and there are some things
that are more important than career.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.450
Now you find him!

24:14.995 --> 24:16.330
STOLTE: Hey, Captain.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.624
I don't have time.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.877
He says he really needs to talk.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.963
You have something for me
or do you need something?

24:24.046 --> 24:26.173
'Cause if it's the latter,
you just wasted my time.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.717
That cellie you stuck me with, Avocado...

24:28.801 --> 24:32.137
Do you have something or do you need
something? Last time I'm gonna ask.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.432
I'm asking you
to just, please, get me out of that cell.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.270
Boss, please. Boss!

24:40.771 --> 24:41.981
Let's go.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.405
(BED CREAKING)

24:54.076 --> 24:57.538
You need to start relaxing.
It'll hurt a lot less.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.417
- Can we go on your bunk?
- Sure, squirt.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.338
Let me make it
a wee bit more comfortable.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.266
Now we're talking.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.270
(BIRDS CAWING)

25:31.321 --> 25:34.825
- Are you the doctor from the prison?
- Yeah. Can, I...

25:34.908 --> 25:37.536
Do you know a prisoner
named Michael Scofield?

25:38.454 --> 25:39.538
I do.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.127
- You're his wife, right?
- I need to talk to you.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.796
I think Michael has got himself
in some trouble.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.800
And I think he's planning on doing
something dangerous to get out of it.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.685
Thanks.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.731
- So what is it that you...
- Michael has a deep need to help people.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.649
So I've come to understand.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.152
That's actually how we met.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.031
There were these men
that brought me here.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.952
Told me I'd have good job,
but that was just a lie.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.288
They were going to sell me.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.916
And until they did, I...

26:26.085 --> 26:28.670
Michael paid them off for my freedom.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.841
And not to keep me for himself,
like I've heard from other girls,

26:32.925 --> 26:35.052
but to give me an opportunity.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.473
He's a good man.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.517
Yes, he is.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.939
Nika, I wanna do
whatever I can to help Michael.

26:47.356 --> 26:51.235
To do that, I need you to tell me
what it is you think he's mixed up in.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.739
- I think this is a mistake.
- No, no, it's not at all.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.575
- If you can just tell me what it is...
- Please, just keep an eye on him.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.703
God, I'm sorry. Thanks.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.998
Listen, could I just have a contact number
for you in case I see something wrong.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.292
I don't think that's a good idea.
Please don't tell him that we met.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.377
L... I.-

27:17.594 --> 27:19.179
Something I don't get.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.557
How could killing me stop you?

27:23.267 --> 27:26.478
'Cause I'm the one who leaked
the information about Ecofield.

27:26.562 --> 27:30.232
They could've covered up the scandal
a thousand different ways,

27:30.315 --> 27:33.068
but they chose to fake
Terrence Steadman's death.

27:34.069 --> 27:38.532
And they chose you
'cause they knew it would flush me out.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.911
They knew that any man with a son
on death row who was innocent

27:43.245 --> 27:45.080
would have to come forward.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.332
But you didn't.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.336
We had a cause, Linc.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.381
We have a cause.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.801
Their wars can be averted

27:59.261 --> 28:01.263
and millions of lives can be saved.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.141
So you were willing to sacrifice one.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.436
Yeah.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.732
At least I thought.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.321
But I couldn't watch you die.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.490
You know what you've done?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.702
The mother of my child is dead.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.246
- I know.
- Do you?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.918
Then I'm guessing you know
Michael's in Fox River

28:31.001 --> 28:34.129
-and LJ's rotting in some jail.
- I know all of it.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.758
- If you think for a second...
- You don't have a choice right now.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.220
This is all on you. All of it.

28:43.138 --> 28:46.642
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

28:47.476 --> 28:50.437
'Cause there's still a chance
we can make it right.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.722
That man in there
is our transportation out of here,

29:25.806 --> 29:29.142
which means that, you go after him,

29:30.018 --> 29:32.145
and that messes with my chances
of me seeing my family.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.314
So I ain't gonna let that happen.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.611
So why don't you just hand me
that shank you're holding, huh?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.867
Good.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.052
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, Rick.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.722
You all right?

30:07.180 --> 30:09.474
Yeah. I can't find my keys.
Would you let me in?

30:09.558 --> 30:10.642
Oh, sure.

30:17.441 --> 30:21.111
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- That makes both of us.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.072
Look.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.619
You were right and I'm sorry.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.039
I should never have gotten you
involved in this.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.082
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.418
If anyone knew what I asked...

30:40.964 --> 30:42.966
I'm not even sure why I did it.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.178
Thank you.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.263
Now we're even.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.351
- You didn't owe me anything.
- Yes, I did.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.605
I owed you everything,
but that's over now.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.484
Good bye.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.532
The lady doctor, she cares for you.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.506
Bellick. It's the sheriff.
I think he's got something.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.757
Go, for Bellick.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.676
We just got a call from Steve
Schimek up at the junkyard.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.679
<i>- Our Mustang is on the premises.
- BELLICK: He seen Burrows?</i>

31:29.763 --> 31:32.682
<i>Yep, I got a couple of units
five, 10 minutes away, tops.</i>

31:32.766 --> 31:34.559
Good, I'm right behind you.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.648
Here. You ready to travel?

31:40.774 --> 31:43.068
Place is gonna be crawling with cops.
You know that, right?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.028
There's an unimproved road
down by the river.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.906
There's a chance
they haven't blocked it off yet.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.785
We got trouble.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.332
Come on. Through here.

33:11.698 --> 33:12.908
Come on.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.075
Hey!

33:23.793 --> 33:25.170
Get out of here.

33:25.754 --> 33:26.880
Go.

33:28.757 --> 33:29.925
Turn around.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.435
Bellick!

33:43.438 --> 33:45.941
Bellick, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

33:56.451 --> 33:58.787
- All right on your knees!
- Right there! Right there!

33:59.788 --> 34:01.456
On your knees! Hands up! Let's see them!

34:01.540 --> 34:02.499
Take him down!

34:02.582 --> 34:04.626
Get down! Get down!

34:08.547 --> 34:11.174
You thought you'd go
for a little stroll, did you?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.362
SUCRE: Did you hear about Avocado?

34:33.655 --> 34:35.991
<i>Got 'ms salchicha sf iced.</i>

34:36.908 --> 34:39.159
- How?
- Tweener.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.036
But Avocado's saying
it got caught on the frame

34:41.121 --> 34:43.665
while he was hopping
down off his bunk, yeah.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.208
Why did he lie?

34:45.292 --> 34:49.295
He doesn't want Tweener to go to
the SHU 'cause he can't get him in there.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.800
All I have to say is, as soon as
Avocado gets out of the infirmary,

34:53.882 --> 34:55.427
Tweener is a dead man.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.305
How's that key coming?

34:59.973 --> 35:01.683
What about your car?
You know, sometimes...

35:01.808 --> 35:02.809
ljustchecked.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.437
Your apartment?

35:07.480 --> 35:09.608
No, 'cause I had them this morning.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.944
Well, then, they gotta be here.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.780
Just retrace your steps.
When did you first notice they were gone?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.782
When I came back from lunch...

35:37.927 --> 35:41.014
Hey, Kev, I need to take a look
at that visitation log.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.112
Thanks.

35:58.615 --> 35:59.908
Michael?

36:01.451 --> 36:03.536
I need to know where he is.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.999
- Who?
- Fibonacci.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.920
You see, my conversion requires
that I not only seek forgiveness,

36:12.003 --> 36:15.924
but provide forgiveness,
even to my greatest transgressors.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.219
Don't look at me like that,

36:19.302 --> 36:23.098
like I'm the same old man I used to be.
I'm not.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.850
Trust me,

36:25.934 --> 36:30.063
I need to reach out to
Fibonacci, so we can heal.

36:32.232 --> 36:35.485
That's a good story, but the answer is no.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.821
I understand.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.741
I'll be patient.

Hey.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.221
You still want me to swipe the thing
you were asking about?

37:45.764 --> 37:48.433
'Cause I'm having
a going-out-of-business sale.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.769
Why don't you get yourself to Ad Seg?

37:52.604 --> 37:55.857
For that to happen, I'd have to admit
what I did to Avocado.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.526
That'd get me what, 20 years?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.488

Yeah, in a body bag.

- Hi.

- How are you?
- I'm fine. You?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.327
Fine.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.665
Can I have your hand, please?

39:03.883 --> 39:06.302
- Here they are.
- Here what are?

39:06.678 --> 39:09.931

they were right over there by your inbox.

waiting outside here,

says you wanted him to change the locks.
Want me to call him off?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.778
No, send him in.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.869
Is it okay if l...

39:33.037 --> 39:35.206
Yeah. We're about done here.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.049
Is there something wrong?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.136
No.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.642
Unless you want to talk about
what happened this morning.

39:54.726 --> 39:58.563
I think I have a pretty good idea.
We're done here.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.507
(MAN CHATTERING ON PA)

40:37.560 --> 40:39.854
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

40:40.521 --> 40:44.567
- He doesn't sneeze without my knowing it.
- What the hell for? What did I do?

40:46.819 --> 40:48.529
Someone tried to kill me.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.368
Finding you in a junkyard eight miles
from here makes me think different.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.245
Who was your accomplice?

40:57.080 --> 41:01.042
- What accomplice?
-24-hour surveillance.

41:27.402 --> 41:28.736
(HUMMING)

41:35.535 --> 41:36.577
Boss.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.332
I heard Avocado
cut his hose on your bunk.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.918
Must have been some serious gymnastics
going on.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.753
I got something for you this time, Boss,

41:45.837 --> 41:48.423
but I want guaranteed protection
from Avocado,

41:48.506 --> 41:51.259
-and I want time cut off my bid.
- Anything else?

41:51.342 --> 41:55.096
Couple of big-canned whores
available to you 24/7?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.515
Believe me, what I got is worth it.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.727
So, are you gonna step up or what?

42:04.105 --> 42:06.107
This is your last chance, Tweener.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.569
You blow smoke again, they'll be
scraping you off the heel of my boot.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.612
Scofield and his whole Pl crew,

42:14.449 --> 42:15.825
they're escaping.
