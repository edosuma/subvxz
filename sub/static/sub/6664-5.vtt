00:00.166 --> 00:01.767
Adult adam:
<i> Halloween in the '80s,</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:03.836
<i> The one day a year</i>
<i> you could wear what you want,</i>

00:03.838 --> 00:05.671
<i> Go where you want,</i>
<i> eat what you want,</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:09.775
<i> And nothing could stop me</i>
<i> in my voltron costume.</i>

00:10.243 --> 00:12.211
<i> Except my "smother."</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:14.213
Oh! Come on.
That's my Halloween candy.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.647
Let me just
eat it already.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.850
Not until we take it
to the hospital

00:17.852 --> 00:18.984
And have it x-rayed.

00:18.986 --> 00:23.756
Ellen shorstein's son found
a handful of aquarium gravel

00:23.758 --> 00:25.791
In an almond cluster.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.059
Tore his braces
right off.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.795
Adult adam:
<i> That was one of the many</i>
<i> urban legends back then.</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:31.463
<i> There was no google</i>
<i> or wikipedia,</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:34.600
<i> So you believed</i>
<i> every stupid rumor you heard,</i>

00:34.602 --> 00:36.502
<i> Like bigfoot lived</i>
<i> in upstate new york</i>

00:36.504 --> 00:39.271
<i> Or mr. Rogers was</i>
<i> the world's most deadly sniper</i>

00:39.273 --> 00:44.009
<i> Or there was a ghost</i>
<i> in</i> three men and a baby.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.411
<i> We actually believed</i>
<i> if you played</i>

00:45.413 --> 00:47.846
<i> Led zeppelin, beatles,</i>
<i> or the stones backwards,</i>

00:47.848 --> 00:50.983
<i> You could hear</i>
<i> hidden satanic messages.</i>

00:50.985 --> 00:53.052
(garbled speech)

00:53.054 --> 00:55.521
Did you hear that?
He said he loves satan!

00:55.523 --> 00:57.923
You know what I love?
Silence!

00:57.925 --> 00:59.458
Stop screwing
with my record player!

00:59.460 --> 01:01.860
Adult adam:
<i> But the most epic</i>
<i> urban legend of them all</i>

01:01.862 --> 01:04.463
<i> Was that cola</i>
<i> became a lethal poison</i>

01:04.465 --> 01:08.200
<i> When mixed with</i>
<i> a particular exploding candy.</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:09.435
Oh!
Aah!

01:09.437 --> 01:10.769
Stupid barry! Why?

01:10.771 --> 01:11.370
Oh, my god.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.672
You were seconds from death,
and I saved you!

01:13.674 --> 01:15.374
What are you talking about?

01:15.376 --> 01:16.508
Hello!

01:16.510 --> 01:17.876
When the bubbles
in the soda

01:17.878 --> 01:19.311
Mix with the explosives
in the pop rocks,

01:19.313 --> 01:22.481
It triggers a chain reaction
that melts your insides!

01:22.483 --> 01:23.315
Shut up.
It does not.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.918
Well, tell that
to mikey.
Who's mikey?

01:25.920 --> 01:27.219
Both: Who's mikey?

01:27.221 --> 01:28.620
Barry:
God, you know nothing.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.890
Mikey, the spokesboy
for life cereal.

01:31.892 --> 01:35.227
You know, he likes it.
Mikey likes it.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.197
Well, he did until
he mixed pop rocks and soda,

01:38.199 --> 01:39.431
Then he exploded.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.033
Oh, please.
He did not.
Wait!

01:41.035 --> 01:43.268
I just
saved your life.
What?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.736
According to the way
of the samurai,

01:44.738 --> 01:47.372
You're my servant
until the debt is repaid.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.073
That's not a thing.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.175
Oh, it is.
It's the bushido code.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.977
Well, that sounds like
complete bull-shido.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.246
It's ancient history
written in stone!

01:54.248 --> 01:55.614
You have no choice!

01:55.616 --> 01:59.451
I'm not anyone's slave.
You didn't save my life.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.819
And it's not real.

02:00.821 --> 02:01.620
All right, then.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.858
If you're so certain
it's not real, then do it.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.493
Do it!

02:08.161 --> 02:10.162
Aah!
What the hell?

02:10.164 --> 02:10.963
What are you,
nuts?

02:10.965 --> 02:15.968
Mikey gave his life
so that that would
never happen again!

02:16.169 --> 02:17.269
Ugh!

02:17.271 --> 02:18.437
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:18.439 --> 02:22.875
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:24.611 --> 02:25.711
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:25.713 --> 02:29.414
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:29.416 --> 02:32.718
Adult adam:
<i> It was October 31,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:35.387
<i> The year my grandfather,</i>
<i> a.K.A. Burt reynolds,</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:37.322
<i> Threw the most epic</i>
<i> Halloween bash</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:39.024
<i> His condo building</i>
<i> had ever seen.</i>

02:39.026 --> 02:42.394
All right, let's get
this party started!

02:42.396 --> 02:45.998
Who wants
flaming pumpkin shots?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.299
(cheering)

02:47.301 --> 02:50.969
Ah!
Trick or treat, baby.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.605
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, pops almost</i>
<i> burned the place down,</i>

02:53.607 --> 02:55.908
<i> But he only cared about</i>
<i> one thing.</i>

02:55.910 --> 02:57.643
Fun party.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.344
Okay.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.213
I smoothed everything over.

03:01.215 --> 03:01.780
So I can stay?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.616
Oh, god, no. Your landlord's
kicking you out.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.318
But you're not going to jail.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.187
Don't worry.
You can move in with us.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.522
Roomies!
We can finally be roomies!

03:10.524 --> 03:12.524
Kiddo, I don't want
to cramp your style.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.493
What if you bring a girl
back to the room?

03:14.495 --> 03:16.662
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.930
Let's go get
a bag packed.

03:17.932 --> 03:18.797
Beverly: Finally!

03:18.799 --> 03:22.568
All my boys under one roof!
It's happening!

03:22.570 --> 03:24.603
No. I know
that look in your eye.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.940
You want your dad
to live with us forever.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.875
Murray, that's a great idea!

03:29.877 --> 03:31.376
Stop making me feel good!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.077
He's not staying!

03:32.079 --> 03:35.547
Bevy, it's time we discussed
other options.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.348
Stop it right there.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.916
I have said this
a thousand times.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.452
We're not moving my dad
into a home.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.421
Shady willows
is not a home.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.625
It's a leisure community
for active seniors.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.594
I don't trust shady willows.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.329
"shady" is in the name.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.164
That's because
old people love shade.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.266
They have trees.
They have umbrellas.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.500
You name it, they got it.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.237
Taco tuesdays, fajita fridays!

03:58.239 --> 03:58.971
It's all there!

03:58.973 --> 04:00.706
That is way too much
mexican food for him.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.242
You're not to mention this
to him. Do you understand?

04:03.244 --> 04:06.445
Family takes care of family.
End of story.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.279
Damn it!

04:07.281 --> 04:07.980
I'm working my ass off

04:07.982 --> 04:10.582
Trying to get people
to move out of our house.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.451
Stop trying to move people in!

04:12.453 --> 04:13.819
Let's compromise, okay?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.854
Until we figure something out,

04:15.856 --> 04:16.822
Dad can crash in the attic.

04:16.824 --> 04:20.359
Ha ha! Good luck
getting him to move up there.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.927
It's hot, it's dusty,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.529
And it's covered
with bat doody.

04:24.631 --> 04:25.964
Son of a bitch.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.399
You got that right.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.468
How'd you pull this off
in two days?

04:29.470 --> 04:30.435
Beverly:
Oh, it was nothing.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.105
I just dusted,
moved some boxes, drywalled,

04:33.107 --> 04:35.907
Did a little electrical work,
added a bay window.

04:35.909 --> 04:36.808
You know,
mother's touch.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.244
Adult adam:
<i> As my mom was busy</i>
<i> moving in pops,</i>

04:39.246 --> 04:43.548
<i> Barry was moving in on lainey</i>
<i> in the hopes to get busy.</i>

04:43.550 --> 04:47.419
88, 89, 100.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.322
Man, exercise
does this body good.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.557
Time for a cool-down.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.459
What are you drinking?

04:54.461 --> 04:54.893
Pepto.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.728
Set the abba-zaba record
at lunch today.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.965
My boys bet me 10 bucks
I couldn't eat 8.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.732
Took down 12.

05:00.734 --> 05:04.403
Are you trying to impress me
by eating Halloween candy?

05:04.405 --> 05:07.039
Not trying.
If it happens, so be it.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.507
Goodbye.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.441
(door opens)

05:09.443 --> 05:11.009
Later, lainey!
(door closes)

05:11.011 --> 05:13.045
Wow. You are the worst.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.513
That's not
what lainey thinks.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.581
She kissed me,
remember?

05:16.583 --> 05:19.718
And now there's so much
electricity between us,

05:19.720 --> 05:22.287
All hot and crackling.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.122
Kind of like pop rocks.

05:24.124 --> 05:24.823
Speaking of which,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.925
Remember how
I saved your life?
No.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.728
According to the bushido code,
you must repay me.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.198
Last night,
I figured out what I want.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.399
Get me the girl.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.934
No!
Just one date!

05:35.936 --> 05:38.103
Talk to her!
Bushido code!

05:38.105 --> 05:38.970
Talking won't help.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.572
Lainey doesn't like
anything about you.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.607
Bushido code!
You must do this!

05:42.609 --> 05:43.275
Oh, my god.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.577
If I do this, will you stop
saying "bushido code"?

05:45.579 --> 05:46.978
According to bushido code,
yes.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.148
Fine. I'll tell her to go
have some pizza with you.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.384
Yes!
First step, pizza.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.253
Second step, we express
our love physically.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.822
Third step.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.923
Ow.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.324
That is not the way
of the samurai!

05:59.326 --> 06:02.861
Adult adam:
<i> As barry was laying down</i>
<i> the laws of the bushido code,</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:05.697
<i> My dad was laying down</i>
<i> some laws of his own.</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:09.234
Okay, now that she's moved in
your giant speakers

06:09.236 --> 06:11.169
And your
king-size waterbed,

06:11.171 --> 06:14.606
It's time to go over
the rules of the house.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.441
These are more
like suggestions,

06:16.443 --> 06:17.275
Nothing hard and fast.

06:17.277 --> 06:22.013
Rule number 1,
do not touch the thermostat.

06:22.015 --> 06:22.647
Touch it?

06:22.649 --> 06:25.650
You've already taped it off
like a crazy person.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.887
Rule number 2,
what's ours is yours.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.124
Rule number 3,
ignore rule number 2.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.092
What's mine is mine.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.627
Rule 4,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.462
No coming in after 10:00.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.664
10:00 in the morning
or 10:00 in the evening?

06:39.666 --> 06:42.100
Why would anyone come in
at 10:00 in the morning?

06:42.102 --> 06:45.670
Why would anyone come in
at 10:00 in the evening?

06:45.672 --> 06:46.471
Rule number 5,

06:46.473 --> 06:50.275
Mandatory hugs every time
you walk through the door.

06:50.277 --> 06:54.179
Rule 6,
no loud music, no parties.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.747
Are these written down
somewhere?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.682
I... I'm kind of
losing track.

06:57.684 --> 07:01.520
Okay, rule 6 1/2,
we love you.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.921
That's not even a rule!

07:02.923 --> 07:04.689
Everyone, just relax.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.858
You've opened
your home to me,

07:06.860 --> 07:09.461
And I'm gonna
respect your wishes.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.364
You see, honey?
This is gonna be great.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.331
Adult adam:
<i> And with that,</i>

07:13.333 --> 07:15.167
<i> We had a new family member</i>
<i> under our roof.</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:17.736
<i> Fortunately, this one was</i>
<i> a responsible adult</i>

07:17.738 --> 07:21.473
<i> Who would never disobey</i>
<i> my dad's insane rules.</i>

07:21.741 --> 07:23.308
<i> Or not.</i>

07:23.976 --> 07:25.277
Max!

07:25.279 --> 07:26.144
It's on max!

07:26.146 --> 07:28.246
(jazz music playing loudly)
he touched it!

07:28.248 --> 07:29.014
He touched
the thermostat!

07:29.016 --> 07:32.083
God only knows how much
money we burned in cold air!

07:32.085 --> 07:34.753
I'll bake him some cookies
and talk to him about it.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.489
No cookies!
Do you hear that loud music?

07:37.491 --> 07:39.291
He's breaking
all of my rules!

07:39.293 --> 07:40.659
Here.
This will take the edge off.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.829
Why are you bringing me
a delicious martini right now?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.331
Pops is schooling me
in the art of mixology

07:46.333 --> 07:48.400
So I can bartend
his parties.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.100
Unacceptable!

07:49.102 --> 07:51.002
All of this
is unacceptable!

07:51.004 --> 07:51.636
Get rid of this.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.104
He's just testing
our boundaries.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.140
If we push him too hard,
he'll rebel more.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.076
You're talking about him like
he's one of our dumb kids,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.145
But he's not!
He's worse!

08:00.147 --> 08:00.946
I can't ground him!

08:00.948 --> 08:03.482
Adult adam:
<i> My dad had reached</i>
<i> his boiling point.</i>

08:03.484 --> 08:06.351
<i> Unfortunately, he didn't know</i>
<i> pops was on a hot date.</i>

08:06.353 --> 08:08.653
Albert! Turn it off!
(woman screams)

08:08.655 --> 08:10.956
Oh, my god!
(thud)

08:13.926 --> 08:14.826
This is not my fault.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.462
I had a necktie
hanging on the door.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.064
When a necktie's
on the door,

08:19.066 --> 08:20.932
The pants
are on the floor.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.400
Everyone knows that.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.569
I can't unsee
what I just saw.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.804
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.406
It was like
a couple of hairless cats

08:28.408 --> 08:30.609
Fighting in a pile
of pizza dough.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.477
It was a very bad
low angle.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.614
That's it, bevy.
He's going to shady willows.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.649
Wait. Shady willows
is on the table?

08:37.651 --> 08:39.017
Bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.052
Murray, we agreed
not to mention that place.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.121
Why not?
I love it there.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.257
No! Family takes care
of family,

08:45.259 --> 08:50.128
And I am not gonna
let a few tiny mishaps
change that.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.230
Aah!

08:52.298 --> 08:56.101
It appears I have popped
another waterbed

08:56.103 --> 08:59.304
While entertaining
a female friend.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.539
You should go.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.040
I should go.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.542
All right.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.510
That's the last of it.

09:06.345 --> 09:06.811
(sighs)

09:06.813 --> 09:08.413
Let's get you
to shady willows.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.282
And step on it
so I don't miss salsa class.

09:10.284 --> 09:14.519
(engine turns over)
that place is crawling
with hot widows.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.453
No!

09:15.455 --> 09:16.054
(sighs)

09:16.056 --> 09:18.590
He's not leaving!
You'll have to run me over!

09:18.592 --> 09:20.659
Just nudge her a bit.
She'll move.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.061
I'm not gonna hit her
with the car, al.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.729
Not hit. Nudge.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.764
Beverly:
Shame on you.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.566
Family takes care
of family.

09:27.568 --> 09:31.836
You keep saying that,
but that's what we're doing.

09:31.838 --> 09:35.073
We're taking your dad
to a place he wants to be.

09:35.075 --> 09:35.574
And then what?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.209
We teach our kids
it's okay to abandon us,

09:38.211 --> 09:39.945
To just
pack up our bags

09:39.947 --> 09:41.546
And throw us out
on an ice floe

09:41.548 --> 09:43.315
And let us drift off
into nothingness?

09:43.317 --> 09:44.683
This sounds like
you're more concerned

09:44.685 --> 09:45.884
With what this means
for you.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.186
No, this has nothing to do
with my greatest fear

09:48.188 --> 09:49.688
Of being alone
when I'm old.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.890
This is about family.

09:51.892 --> 09:52.524
Oh!

09:52.526 --> 09:54.726
So that's why
you're against this.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.495
You're afraid
that our stupid children

09:57.497 --> 09:59.164
Will put you
into a home.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.399
Don't spin this around
on me.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.201
This is about my father,

10:03.203 --> 10:04.402
About my mantra...

10:04.404 --> 10:06.204
Family takes care
of beverly.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.739
I mean family.
You know what?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.674
That was a bad slip,
and I admit that.

10:09.676 --> 10:13.144
Put your seat belt on.
I'm gonna nudge her.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.346
Good for you.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.981
(tires screech)

10:16.415 --> 10:17.415
Don't you nudge me.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.117
Oh, I'm nudging you!

10:19.119 --> 10:20.652
Don't you nudge me!

10:20.654 --> 10:23.154
Murray:
You've been nudged!
This isn't over,

10:23.156 --> 10:24.956
Not by a long shot, mister!

10:24.958 --> 10:29.728
I will (bleep) (bleep)
(bleep).

10:31.664 --> 10:32.864
So!

10:32.866 --> 10:35.400
Saw you talking
to lainey this morning.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.135
We all set?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.370
What are you wearing?

10:38.372 --> 10:40.739
It's my fanciest
flavor flav clock.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.575
Or should I go digital?
Show her I'm a modern man.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.310
Put your clock back
on your nightstand.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.178
I talked to lainey
about this weekend.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.213
It's a no-go.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.514
Oh, it's a scheduling issue?

10:49.516 --> 10:51.650
Tell her I'm available
Monday through Friday

10:51.652 --> 10:54.452
And every other weekend ever
plus all other weekdays.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.988
Yeah, no,
that's not the issue.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.356
She thinks you're...

10:58.358 --> 11:01.059
How do I put this gently?
Gross.

11:01.061 --> 11:01.493
What?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.228
Did you tell her
I can bench 200?
Yep.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.631
Did you tell her I can pop,
like, three wheelies in a row?
I did.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.833
Did you tell her
I'm a self-taught dancer?

11:08.835 --> 11:09.634
She was not impressed.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.169
Did you tell her
that I give no excuses

11:11.171 --> 11:12.437
And take no prisoners?
No dice.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.039
Did you tell her
I'm silky smooth

11:14.041 --> 11:14.973
But cut from steel?
Totally.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.242
Did you tell her
I can kick as high
as my head

11:17.244 --> 11:18.843
And I used to own
a python?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.546
I told her everything.
No go.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.348
I thought...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.316
I actually had a shot.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.018
Aw...

11:27.353 --> 11:28.019
You don't.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.554
I'm never gonna
find a girl.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.790
Seriously, I'm gonna
be alone forever.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.024
It's not fair!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.726
Stop being so dramatic.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.860
Bushido code.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.829
I've been rejected
and shamed.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.165
Let these pop rocks
and soda be the sword

11:40.167 --> 11:42.200
That brings me
an honorable samurai death.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.069
I talked to
the science teacher.

11:44.071 --> 11:44.636
It's not real.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.237
Well, tell that
to the chemical reaction

11:46.239 --> 11:48.239
Happening in my mouth
right now.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.040
This is science.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.742
Adult adam:
<i> While barry had given up</i>
<i> on his future,</i>

11:50.744 --> 11:54.412
<i> My mom was trying</i>
<i> to secure hers.</i>

11:54.513 --> 11:55.480
Hey, snuggle bear.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.984
Came to cheer you up.
I know how upset you must be.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.387
About what?

12:02.888 --> 12:03.988
Well, I don't
want you to think

12:03.990 --> 12:07.258
In this family
we abandon our parents.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.526
Pops should be living here,

12:08.528 --> 12:11.329
Just like how I'm
gonna be living with you.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.664
Wait. What?

12:12.666 --> 12:14.666
Since when are you
living with me?

12:14.668 --> 12:15.366
What about erica?

12:15.368 --> 12:18.136
Lovely girl, but deal with
those mood swings?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.304
No, thank you.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.005
Well, then
go live with barry.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.640
Oh, sweetie,
it's more than likely

12:22.642 --> 12:23.575
We'll be taking care
of him.

12:23.577 --> 12:27.545
What? So now I'm taking care
of you and barry?

12:27.547 --> 12:28.213
Just me.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.914
We'll find
a place for barry.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.483
Maybe the merchant marine
or a commune.

12:31.485 --> 12:35.086
Why does barry get
to live on a commune
while I'm stuck with you?

12:35.088 --> 12:35.920
Hon, not just me.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.255
You'll have
your lovely wife

12:37.257 --> 12:39.457
And four beautiful boys
for support.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.427
No way. I won't have
room for you, too.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.628
Well, we'll convert
the garage

12:43.630 --> 12:45.830
Into a cozy,
little in-law suite.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.499
The garage
is my space!

12:47.501 --> 12:48.399
That's where
I watch movies

12:48.401 --> 12:50.068
And display
my collectible figurines.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.203
Oh, you can move all that
down to the basement.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.773
So now I'm getting banished
down to the basement?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.609
I work my ass off,
and this is all I get?

12:57.611 --> 12:58.576
Fine.
Take the garage.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.613
I'll just live down in the
basement like a mole person.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.514
Is that what you want?

13:02.516 --> 13:03.948
Why can't you just
stay in a hotel

13:03.950 --> 13:05.650
And visit
every once in a while?

13:05.652 --> 13:06.284
A hotel?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.552
Where the maid
can steal my jewelry

13:07.554 --> 13:10.522
And someone can break in
and clonk me on the head?

13:10.524 --> 13:12.090
Fine!
Don't visit, then!

13:12.092 --> 13:15.326
Oh, I know
where this is coming from.

13:15.328 --> 13:15.894
Your wife.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.162
You said
she was lovely!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.897
When it's convenient
for her.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.166
Why are we even
talking about this?

13:21.168 --> 13:21.933
I'm just a little boy!

13:21.935 --> 13:23.768
Where are you going,
young man?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.203
To stay with pops!
You're crazy.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.106
Adult adam: <i> While I headed</i>
<i> down to shady willows,</i>

13:28.108 --> 13:30.308
<i> My mom headed up</i>
<i> to my treehouse</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:32.877
<i> To contemplate her future.</i>

13:35.247 --> 13:38.316
What are you
doing up here?

13:38.717 --> 13:39.884
I needed
to eat my feelings,

13:39.886 --> 13:43.488
And this is where adam hid
his Halloween candy from you.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.289
Anything good left?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.291
Just these awful
circus peanuts.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.560
Yeah,
nobody wants those.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.696
Just like me.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.566
I'm the circus peanut
of mothers.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.533
What are you talking about?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.135
Adam won't let me
live with him when I'm old.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.903
God knows
erica won't take me in.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.574
So looks like this is
where I'm gonna spend
my golden years,

14:02.576 --> 14:04.809
Right up here
in this treehouse.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.543
Well, what about barry?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.545
Oh, well,
you've solved that problem.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.348
Please reserve me
the master suite

14:10.350 --> 14:13.218
In his rap mansion
in the clouds.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.152
Trust me, bevy.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.655
Our kids will
never abandon you.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.389
How do you know?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.558
Look at how well
you treat your own dad.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.693
You think
they don't notice that?

14:21.695 --> 14:25.430
Well, I guess I am
pretty blatant with my love.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.564
Of course you are.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.799
And it's like
you always say.

14:27.801 --> 14:31.736
Family takes care
of family.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.004
And speaking of which,

14:33.006 --> 14:35.940
I could use some help
getting down from here.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.775
(chuckles)

14:37.777 --> 14:38.376
No.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.611
Adult adam: <i> My mom</i>
<i> may have been kidding,</i>

14:39.613 --> 14:42.580
<i> But barry's love for lainey</i>
<i> was no joke.</i>

14:42.582 --> 14:43.781
(gasps) lainey!

14:43.783 --> 14:44.983
Okay.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.286
Before you say anything,
just hear me out.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.688
I know erica gave you
the big sell on me,

14:50.690 --> 14:54.092
But I can't just give up on us
without a fight.

14:54.094 --> 14:54.959
What's happening?

14:54.961 --> 14:56.661
I'm-a tell you
what's happening.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.162
Jtp, drop the beat.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.364
(beatboxing)

14:59.366 --> 15:03.234
<i> ¶ I'd do anything</i>
<i> for a girl named lainey</i>

15:03.236 --> 15:03.801
Yeah!

15:03.803 --> 15:05.503
<i> ¶ I'll punch a tiger,</i>
<i> swim the allegheny</i>

15:05.505 --> 15:07.739
<i> ¶ I know it's creepy 'cause</i>
<i> I'm her best friend's brother</i>

15:07.741 --> 15:10.708
<i> ¶ but I love her,</i>
<i> and we should be together</i>

15:10.710 --> 15:13.745
<i> ¶ like joanie loves chachi,</i>
<i> tango loves cash</i>

15:13.747 --> 15:14.746
<i> ¶ she the turner to my hooch</i>

15:14.748 --> 15:16.080
<i> ¶ I'll be the bangers</i>
<i> in your mash</i>

15:16.082 --> 15:17.548
Oh, my god! Stop!
(beatboxing stops)

15:17.550 --> 15:19.250
Don't stop!
(beatboxing resumes)

15:19.252 --> 15:20.852
<i> ¶ "l" to the "y"</i>
<i> to the "n" to the "e"</i>

15:20.854 --> 15:24.689
<i> ¶ that spells lainey,</i>
<i> that's a rap from big tasty</i>

15:24.691 --> 15:26.958
First of all, you spelled
my name horribly wrong.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.994
And secondly, erica never
talked to me about you.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.562
What? But...

15:31.564 --> 15:33.164
She said that...

15:33.166 --> 15:34.832
Erica swore to me!

15:34.834 --> 15:35.533
We had an agreement!

15:35.535 --> 15:37.502
She talked me up,
but you said no.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.770
Yeah,
that didn't happen.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.637
Adult adam:
<i> In that moment,</i>

15:39.639 --> 15:43.374
<i> Barry knew the next thing</i>
<i> he said had to be perfect.</i>

15:48.981 --> 15:49.714
Lies.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.983
You have no honor
whatsoever!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.451
I'm okay with that.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.154
Don't you walk away
from me.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.922
I saved your life.

15:57.924 --> 15:58.589
Ow.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.124
And this is
how you repay me?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.159
You should be
thanking me.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.627
I was just trying to
spare your feelings.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.363
I didn't expect you to do
some love rap to lainey

16:05.365 --> 16:06.064
About turner
and hooch.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.865
They weren't even
a couple, dude.

16:07.867 --> 16:08.599
One is a dog.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.036
That dog took a bullet
for tom hanks!

16:12.038 --> 16:13.738
That's love!

16:13.906 --> 16:14.772
Aah!

16:14.774 --> 16:15.673
I'm in so much pain!

16:15.675 --> 16:17.275
Yeah, yeah.
Your heart is broken.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.644
Just stop
with the dramatics.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.044
No!

16:20.046 --> 16:22.613
There's something wrong
with my insides! Aah!

16:22.615 --> 16:25.583
Oh, no.
Oh, god, it's happening!

16:25.585 --> 16:28.219
Pop rocks and cola!
I'm mikey!

16:28.221 --> 16:29.420
It's not real!

16:29.422 --> 16:30.188
Oh, this is real.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.889
It just took longer
to take me down

16:31.891 --> 16:33.725
'cause my body's
in peak condition.

16:33.727 --> 16:34.425
Oh, yeah.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.160
You did this to me.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.729
This is on you!

16:37.731 --> 16:39.364
Barry.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.965
Get up!

16:41.500 --> 16:41.866
Barry?

16:41.868 --> 16:44.035
Adult adam: <i> As barry</i>
<i> was rushed over to the e.R.,</i>

16:44.037 --> 16:45.336
<i> My mom rushed to fetch me</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:48.906
<i> From pops' new luxurious</i>
<i> retirement community.</i>

16:48.908 --> 16:51.376
Hi, daddy.
Can I come in?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.411
There's no tie on the door.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.279
You're good to go.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.916
Beverly: Wow.
You did all this?

16:58.918 --> 17:02.020
Hey, you get it
from somewhere.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.455
Are you sure
you'll be okay here?

17:04.457 --> 17:07.325
Bev,
this is where I belong.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.260
Good food,
good people.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.629
And you wouldn't believe
how far a full head of hair

17:11.631 --> 17:14.866
Will get you in here
with the ladies.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.036
Well,
I'm happy for you.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.505
And, uh, thanks
for looking after adam.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.172
Ah.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.575
A little time away
was the best thing for him.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.643
Adam: Ahh!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.712
Just took
a good schvitz.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.713
Oh, and I
ran into irma.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.948
She invited us over
to play some gin rummy.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.084
Uh, sweetie, I think
it's time to come home.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.019
No.
I'm never coming home.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.487
This place has a sauna,

17:36.489 --> 17:38.456
An early-bird
dinner at 4:30,

17:38.458 --> 17:40.091
And a seat
in every shower.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.994
All my life,
I have been washing my body

17:42.996 --> 17:45.163
Standing up like a yutz.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.498
He's only been here
for two hours.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.669
Well, the kid knows
a good thing when he sees it.

17:52.204 --> 17:52.737
(snaps fingers)

17:52.739 --> 17:54.972
(modern english's
<i> I melt with you</i> playing)

17:54.974 --> 17:57.909
Wow.
An obstructed bowel.

17:57.911 --> 17:58.643
Didn't see that coming.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.812
Who knew eating
12 full-sized taffy bars

18:00.814 --> 18:03.581
And drinking
all that pink goop
would block me up.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.149
Most people.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.684
So, after all of that,

18:06.686 --> 18:08.786
You saved
my life for real.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.654
I did, didn't I?

18:09.656 --> 18:10.688
Stupid bushido code.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.522
Now I'm forever
in your debt.

18:11.524 --> 18:15.660
Actually, I thought
today I'd be the one
to do you a favor.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.828
Adult adam:
<i> In the end, for erica,</i>

18:16.830 --> 18:18.296
<i> It wasn't about</i>
<i> the bushido code.</i>

18:18.298 --> 18:21.732
<i> It was about being</i>
<i> a good big sister.</i>

18:21.734 --> 18:26.304
<i> ¶ I'll stop the world</i>
<i> and melt with you</i>

18:27.940 --> 18:28.906
<i> ¶ you've seen the difference</i>

18:28.908 --> 18:31.209
<i> ¶ and it's getting better</i>
<i> all the time</i>

18:31.211 --> 18:32.210
Hey.
Hi.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.078
I've got to make
a phone call.

18:34.080 --> 18:39.517
<i> ¶ dream of better lives,</i>
<i> the kind which never hate</i>

18:39.519 --> 18:41.119
So, how's your butt?

18:41.121 --> 18:41.552
Horrible.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.421
But it's not even
the worst part of my week.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.723
Yeah.
About that love rap...

18:45.725 --> 18:47.592
Let's just forget
it ever happened.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.527
Know what? No.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.829
I said it,
and I stand by it.

18:51.831 --> 18:56.801
Oh. Well, your persistence
is misguided and annoying,

18:57.269 --> 18:58.636
But kind of cute.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.872
<i> ¶ I'll stop the world</i>
<i> and melt with you</i>

19:00.874 --> 19:02.807
So, I heard this place
has really good pizza.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.841
You want to grab a slice?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.576
I can't eat
for another 24 hours...

19:05.578 --> 19:07.378
<i> ¶ you've seen the difference</i>

19:07.380 --> 19:08.146
...But I can
sit with you.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.816
<i> ¶ and it's getting better</i>
<i> all the time</i>

19:11.818 --> 19:12.717
Hey.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.118
Kind of early
for bedtime.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.889
Well, eating dinner at 4:30
kind of threw me off.

19:17.891 --> 19:18.756
Oh.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.691
Um, you want some tucks?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.493
I'm too old for tucks.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.495
Listen.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.397
I'm sorry
I freaked you out.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.166
It's not your job
to take care of me.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.067
It's my job
to take care of you.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.503
But what's gonna happen
when I grow up?

19:32.505 --> 19:36.040
Well, we have a long time
to figure that out, shmoopie.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.075
A long time.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.745
Sure you don't want
a tuck?

19:41.180 --> 19:41.779
Maybe a little one.

19:41.781 --> 19:46.117
<i> ¶ there's nothing</i>
<i> you and I won't do</i>

19:47.953 --> 19:50.454
<i> ¶ I'll stop the world... ¶</i>
hey, mom?

19:50.456 --> 19:51.889
I'm sure
when the time comes,

19:51.891 --> 19:54.625
I'll find some space
for you in my house.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.359
Really?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.895
Yeah. I'll always
make room for you.

19:57.897 --> 19:58.296
(sighs)

19:58.298 --> 20:00.031
Adult adam: <i> Sure,</i>
<i> we had our differences,</i>
<i> but my mom was right.</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:04.101
<i> Family takes care of family,</i>
<i> and that's no urban legend.</i>

20:04.103 --> 20:05.269
Got to admit,

20:05.271 --> 20:07.305
This is my first date
in a hospital.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.207
Wait.
This is a date?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.075
Well, pity date.

20:11.077 --> 20:11.709
I'll take it.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.978
Adult adam:
<i> And without family,</i>
<i> barry's worst day</i>

20:13.980 --> 20:16.380
<i> Wouldn't have become</i>
<i> his best day.</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:18.449
(door opens)
beverly: There you are!

20:18.451 --> 20:19.917
Adult adam:
<i> And then his worst day.</i>

20:19.919 --> 20:20.851
My delicious little baby,

20:20.853 --> 20:23.988
I am so sorry I wasn't home
when they called.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.389
Mom, please!

20:25.391 --> 20:28.125
Your poor,
clogged bottom.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.461
Nurse! Nurse!

20:32.030 --> 20:34.198
Man: Say something
for the camera.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.802
I love him.
I love him. Mwah!

20:44.009 --> 20:45.943
(coughs)

20:46.178 --> 20:47.945
Don't worry.
Mama's got this.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.180
Arms up. Arms up.

20:49.182 --> 20:49.914
(coughs)

20:49.916 --> 20:53.751
Dude! You just, like,
saved my life!

20:53.753 --> 20:54.252
Thank you.

20:54.254 --> 20:58.022
You don't have to thank me.
It's my job.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.325
But according to bushido code,

21:01.327 --> 21:02.927
You will have to repay me.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.129
You know about bushido code?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.497
Oh, I watched <i> shogun.</i>

21:06.499 --> 21:07.198
(inhales deeply)

21:07.200 --> 21:10.001
That richard chamberlain,
meow.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.302
Fine. What do you want?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.170
I want snuggies.
Aw, come on!

21:13.172 --> 21:16.274
I want huggies and cuddlies
and smoochies.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.675
No!
I want them.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.676
No!
I want them.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.344
I choose a warrior's death
instead!

21:20.346 --> 21:22.313
Put the taco
back in my mouth!

21:22.315 --> 21:25.216
Bushido code!
You have no honor!

21:25.218 --> 21:26.917
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
