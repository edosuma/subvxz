00:23.502 --> 00:26.385
<i>In the year 1855,</i>

00:26.386 --> 00:30.467
<i>England and France were at
war with Russia in the Crimea.</i>

00:30.468 --> 00:33.721
<i>The English troops
were paid in gold.</i>

00:34.305 --> 00:39.935
<i>Once a month Â£25,000 in gold
was loaded into strongboxes...</i>

00:39.936 --> 00:43.730
<i>inside the London bank of
Huddleston and Bradford...</i>

00:43.731 --> 00:48.110
<i>and taken by trusted armed
guards to the railway station.</i>

00:48.402 --> 00:52.532
<i>The convoy followed no
fixed route or timetable.</i>

00:52.741 --> 00:58.412
<i>At the station the gold was loaded into
the luggage van of the Folkestone train...</i>

00:58.413 --> 01:02.375
<i>for shipment to the coast
and from there to the Crimea.</i>

01:02.376 --> 01:06.796
<i>The strongboxes were placed in
two specially built Chubb safes...</i>

01:06.797 --> 01:10.759
<i>constructed of three-quarter-
inch tempered steel.</i>

01:10.760 --> 01:14.555
<i>Each safe weighed 550 pounds.</i>

01:14.680 --> 01:19.351
<i>Each safe was fitted with two
locks requiring two keys,...</i>

01:19.560 --> 01:22.563
<i>or four keys altogether.</i>

01:24.190 --> 01:28.610
<i>For security, each key was
individually protected.</i>

01:28.611 --> 01:34.408
<i>Two keys were entrusted to the railway
dispatcher, who kept them in his office.</i>

01:34.409 --> 01:38.037
<i>A third was in the custody
of Mr Edgar Trent,...</i>

01:38.038 --> 01:41.332
<i>president of the
Huddleston and Bradford.</i>

01:41.333 --> 01:44.752
<i>And the fourth key was
given to Mr Henry Fowler,...</i>

01:44.753 --> 01:47.963
<i>manager of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank.</i>

01:47.964 --> 01:51.259
<i>The presence of so much
gold in one place...</i>

01:51.260 --> 01:55.263
<i>naturally aroused the interests of
the English criminal elements,...</i>

01:55.264 --> 02:02.479
<i>but in 1855 there had never been a
robbery from a moving railway train.</i>

04:29.090 --> 04:31.426
Is he dead?

04:31.427 --> 04:34.012
Mm.

04:41.896 --> 04:46.524
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that...
one poor fellow working alone.

04:46.525 --> 04:48.777
He had no chance of success.

04:48.778 --> 04:51.947
Indeed, speaking on
behalf of the bank,...

04:51.948 --> 04:58.120
I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

04:58.121 --> 05:01.040
I think I may say that without
fear of contradiction.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.917
The villain expired?

05:02.918 --> 05:06.462
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

05:06.463 --> 05:08.756
He died instantly. Poor devil.

05:08.757 --> 05:12.469
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

05:12.470 --> 05:17.265
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

05:17.266 --> 05:20.060
He was obviously after
the Crimean gold.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.146
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war...

05:23.147 --> 05:26.399
- will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.154
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

05:30.155 --> 05:33.824
What do you expect when one
man in seven has the vote?

05:33.825 --> 05:36.785
We have shopkeepers voting now!

05:36.786 --> 05:40.289
And women next. If
they get their way.

05:40.457 --> 05:43.667
Women voting! Really!

05:43.668 --> 05:47.838
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

05:47.839 --> 05:52.594
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy!

05:52.595 --> 05:57.724
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

05:57.725 --> 06:01.186
Edward's got the proper
view by not marrying at all.

06:01.187 --> 06:02.812
Someone will catch him.

06:02.813 --> 06:06.483
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

06:06.484 --> 06:10.488
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married!

06:10.489 --> 06:14.992
This thief on the train, Henry. Was
there a risk of him stealing the gold?

06:14.993 --> 06:19.371
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

06:19.372 --> 06:26.378
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. Impossible.

06:26.379 --> 06:30.258
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

06:30.259 --> 06:34.804
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

06:34.805 --> 06:39.976
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

06:39.977 --> 06:43.980
I don't know where Mr Trent keeps
his key but I know of the fourth,...

06:43.981 --> 06:48.193
for I am myself entrusted
with guarding it.

06:48.194 --> 06:52.489
Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden your key?

06:52.490 --> 06:56.619
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.370
Even when bathing?

06:58.371 --> 07:01.874
Even while bathing. It
never leaves my person.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.460
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

07:04.461 --> 07:08.756
So you see, to get all four
keys... quite impossible.

07:08.757 --> 07:13.970
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

07:13.971 --> 07:16.097
Thank God for that.

07:16.098 --> 07:19.518
You may count on it,
Edward. Count on it.

07:20.436 --> 07:25.982
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

07:25.983 --> 07:30.237
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

07:30.238 --> 07:32.824
It does among that group.

07:33.742 --> 07:36.327
And what's your business?

07:36.828 --> 07:42.041
It's not really clear. I've made a great
deal of money in coal, in the north.

07:42.042 --> 07:46.086
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

07:46.087 --> 07:47.421
Are you?

07:47.422 --> 07:52.802
I think so. I've... made
something of myself.

07:52.803 --> 07:55.389
Do they believe all that?

07:56.974 --> 08:02.020
Among sharp businessmen one
doesn't ask too many questions.

08:03.022 --> 08:05.982
Do they know of your
interest in the theatre?

08:05.983 --> 08:08.693
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

08:08.694 --> 08:13.157
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

08:14.492 --> 08:17.078
Did they mention the train?

08:17.203 --> 08:19.621
Mm-hm.

08:19.622 --> 08:22.583
What did they say?

08:22.584 --> 08:26.003
They all agreed that
it was impossible.

08:26.463 --> 08:29.047
Simply impossible.

08:29.048 --> 08:31.635
You like that?

08:44.607 --> 08:48.902
- I can tell it excites you.
- Mm-hm.

10:23.376 --> 10:26.087
Oh! Are you all right?

10:42.980 --> 10:45.565
Nice pull.

10:49.987 --> 10:52.990
Not bad, if I do say so
myself. You look well.

10:52.991 --> 10:55.117
Yes. How was the touch?

10:55.118 --> 10:57.202
You saw it, didn't you?

10:57.203 --> 11:00.289
Or was I so fast you
couldn't see it?

11:02.750 --> 11:04.084
I saw.

11:04.085 --> 11:07.296
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

11:07.297 --> 11:10.049
Hummingbirds.

11:13.012 --> 11:17.849
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

11:21.228 --> 11:25.231
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

11:25.232 --> 11:26.524
They could.

11:26.525 --> 11:29.527
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

11:29.528 --> 11:32.240
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

11:32.615 --> 11:35.701
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

11:36.369 --> 11:39.246
You didn't do the Berkeley
Hills job, did you?

11:39.247 --> 11:41.874
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

11:41.875 --> 11:46.336
A shit job? Well, they're clean
with 2,000 guineas gone.

11:46.337 --> 11:49.757
No. I was thinking
of something bigger.

11:52.386 --> 11:56.097
- This wax. On the fly?
- Mm-hm.

11:56.098 --> 11:57.640
Then I'm your man.

11:57.641 --> 12:01.352
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

12:01.353 --> 12:05.690
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

12:07.568 --> 12:09.026
Good night.

12:09.027 --> 12:11.280
Mr Edgar Trent,...

12:11.281 --> 12:14.950
president of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank,...

12:14.951 --> 12:17.619
follows an inflexible routine,...

12:17.620 --> 12:22.500
departing the bank at the end
of each day promptly at 7 pm.

12:39.184 --> 12:43.604
Mr Trent resides at number
seven Belgrave Square.

12:43.605 --> 12:48.568
It's a mansion of 23 rooms,
not including servants' quarters.

12:48.569 --> 12:52.739
His second wife, Emily,
is 30 years his junior...

12:52.740 --> 12:59.830
and with her unmarried stepdaughter
she runs the household very strictly.

13:03.084 --> 13:05.794
There are ten servants employed.

13:05.795 --> 13:11.342
Coachman, butler, gardener,
doorman, cook and two maids.

13:11.343 --> 13:14.846
All the servants are content
and can't be bribed.

13:15.639 --> 13:19.684
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

13:19.685 --> 13:23.021
Seven in the morning
and 8.15 at night.

13:23.647 --> 13:25.690
- Children?
- Five.

13:25.691 --> 13:29.902
Three at home. The youngest
is a boy who sleepwalks.

13:29.903 --> 13:32.615
Which creates a commotion.

13:43.710 --> 13:48.880
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

13:48.881 --> 13:53.011
The person who knows where
that key is is Mr Trent.

13:54.221 --> 13:56.890
Really?

13:59.226 --> 14:04.481
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink... Women?

14:04.940 --> 14:07.525
Well, hello!

14:13.449 --> 14:16.035
No, no, no.

14:17.245 --> 14:19.538
No!

14:23.501 --> 14:27.755
No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.

14:59.622 --> 15:04.210
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

15:13.345 --> 15:18.308
Thank you, gentlemen, please!
Mind your back there, sir!

15:18.392 --> 15:20.560
Thank you! Excuse me, sir!

15:20.561 --> 15:24.022
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

15:24.314 --> 15:29.527
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

15:29.528 --> 15:33.949
Who wants to try a rat? Come on,
gents. Who wants to try a rat?

15:33.950 --> 15:37.077
15 of your best for my fancy.

15:37.078 --> 15:42.500
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

15:42.959 --> 15:47.504
Let Mr T's fancy dog
through. There you are.

15:48.172 --> 15:53.511
- 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.806
And he's called for
a try at 15 rats.

15:57.266 --> 16:00.310
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

16:00.561 --> 16:05.482
Three minutes it is. You
may wager as you feel fit.

16:06.608 --> 16:09.277
Get him his 15, Tom.

16:11.281 --> 16:14.784
You win some, you lose some.

16:28.619 --> 16:32.165
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

16:34.376 --> 16:36.961
And... go!

17:18.858 --> 17:22.320
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes!

17:22.405 --> 17:26.950
Get the dog out. Get the dog out.
Thank you, gentlemen.

17:26.951 --> 17:29.035
Pay your debts. Who's next?

17:29.036 --> 17:32.331
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

17:32.332 --> 17:36.252
A sporting chap. You win one
or two, you lose one or two.

17:36.503 --> 17:42.842
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

17:48.890 --> 17:51.477
May I join you?

17:51.644 --> 17:54.354
If you like.

18:04.490 --> 18:10.538
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked
bustle. But he came up well enough.

18:10.539 --> 18:13.958
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

18:13.959 --> 18:17.086
And I shall wager upon
him again when he does.

18:17.087 --> 18:20.798
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

18:21.091 --> 18:23.676
Ten guineas!

18:24.219 --> 18:27.597
Well, I'm pleased you
take it so lightly.

18:28.014 --> 18:31.977
I admire a man who may
keep a fancy and sport him.

18:32.228 --> 18:36.690
I should do so myself were I not
so often abroad on business.

18:36.691 --> 18:41.028
Whenever I'm gone, my wife
looks after the animals.

18:41.404 --> 18:46.450
I fear I've been too devoted to
business these past few years.

18:47.284 --> 18:49.870
I've never married.

18:50.872 --> 18:54.834
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

18:56.378 --> 19:00.381
It's so hard to
meet a suitable girl.

19:10.434 --> 19:16.356
- What are you constructing?
- A water wheel. Delightful.

19:16.357 --> 19:22.112
Especially with the rusted curve of the
water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

19:22.113 --> 19:26.199
We are building the rusted
wheel at considerable expense.

19:26.200 --> 19:31.997
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

19:31.998 --> 19:37.795
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

19:37.796 --> 19:40.589
Oh, I'm sure it'll
be a handsome ruin.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.591
Where is Elizabeth?

19:42.592 --> 19:45.553
I have passed many
pleasant hours here...

19:45.554 --> 19:50.601
watching the workmen fit each
piece into its precise slot.

19:51.018 --> 19:53.604
Such skill.

19:54.063 --> 19:55.939
They screw it together?

19:55.940 --> 20:00.735
No, bolt it, actually, with
long bolts. Fitted tightly.

20:00.736 --> 20:05.324
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

20:05.866 --> 20:11.872
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

20:11.873 --> 20:15.125
It is exciting to see
things come together.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.546
So long as the quality
does not suffer.

20:18.839 --> 20:22.216
Tight-fitting joints.
That's the secret.

20:22.884 --> 20:26.345
It is so rare these days.

20:27.514 --> 20:31.351
It depends on the skill of
the workman, of course.

20:31.352 --> 20:34.479
And he must have the proper tools.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.274
Ah, my darling daughter!

20:37.650 --> 20:42.737
Now may I present Mr Edward
Pierce? My daughter Elizabeth.

20:42.738 --> 20:46.866
Miss Trent, you've taken
me completely by surprise.

20:46.867 --> 20:49.536
I cannot tell if that's
to my advantage.

20:49.537 --> 20:52.164
I can assure you it is, wholly.

20:52.165 --> 20:56.836
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

20:57.337 --> 20:58.379
Er...

20:58.380 --> 21:01.715
We are just discussing
the ruins, Elizabeth.

21:01.716 --> 21:06.679
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

21:07.514 --> 21:10.015
They've taken away so many flowers.

21:10.016 --> 21:11.601
You're fond of flowers?

21:11.602 --> 21:13.603
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

21:13.604 --> 21:17.941
Yes, I supervise the planting of
all the flowers in the garden.

21:17.942 --> 21:19.859
What there is left of it.

21:19.860 --> 21:22.695
I'm especially fond
of the primroses.

21:22.696 --> 21:24.114
Ah, yes!

21:24.115 --> 21:26.908
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

21:27.034 --> 21:28.868
I'd be delighted!

21:28.869 --> 21:31.456
Will you excuse us?

21:31.581 --> 21:35.125
It's quite rare for a man to
take an interest in flowers.

21:35.126 --> 21:38.880
The best of them are just
over here. Let me show you.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.882
I don't know that he's
suitable for her.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.761
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

21:45.762 --> 21:50.015
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

21:50.016 --> 21:55.438
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

21:55.439 --> 21:58.108
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

22:05.991 --> 22:08.577
He has his charm.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.956
You don't care who
she marries, do you?

22:13.542 --> 22:16.127
Is she really plain?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.921
That she is.

22:19.089 --> 22:23.468
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.306
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.518
Really, I never noticed.

22:33.521 --> 22:35.522
You're in a hurry.

22:35.523 --> 22:37.774
I am a relentless suitor.

22:37.775 --> 22:41.737
Besides, she still hasn't
told me what I need to know.

22:42.780 --> 22:45.323
Where did you learn to ride?

22:45.324 --> 22:49.494
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

22:49.495 --> 22:51.497
France.

22:51.498 --> 22:53.791
On an estate in France.

22:53.792 --> 22:56.210
Not in America?

22:56.211 --> 23:00.006
No, I've never been to America.

23:01.966 --> 23:04.552
When were you in France?

23:04.803 --> 23:07.597
It's been some time now.

23:09.057 --> 23:12.060
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

23:12.061 --> 23:14.646
The truth?

23:15.022 --> 23:17.608
The truth?

23:18.359 --> 23:20.944
No.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.162
I worry about him so.

24:10.497 --> 24:14.500
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

24:14.501 --> 24:18.587
Father's always nervous when
he sends the gold to Crimea.

24:18.588 --> 24:20.964
He's a different man on those days.

24:20.965 --> 24:23.759
He bears a heavy responsibility.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.512
He acts so strangely!

24:28.264 --> 24:34.312
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

24:34.313 --> 24:40.944
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

24:40.945 --> 24:45.406
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

24:45.407 --> 24:50.704
With no servants to hold the
lanterns. He insists on going alone.

24:50.705 --> 24:53.332
Perhaps he's just
checking the contents.

24:53.333 --> 24:58.838
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

24:58.963 --> 25:03.801
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

25:04.135 --> 25:07.262
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

25:07.263 --> 25:09.849
Mine? I have none at all.

25:10.016 --> 25:12.602
Well, one.

25:12.937 --> 25:17.607
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

25:17.608 --> 25:19.609
Sir!

25:19.610 --> 25:22.779
You're a bold rogue
to be so forward.

25:23.864 --> 25:29.411
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

25:29.787 --> 25:32.248
Never, my darling.

25:32.457 --> 25:34.666
Oh, dear Edward.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.253
I'm so happy.

25:37.712 --> 25:40.298
And I am happy too.

25:41.007 --> 25:45.344
He keeps the key in
the bloody wine cellar.

26:38.067 --> 26:40.777
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

26:40.778 --> 26:45.782
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

27:29.536 --> 27:32.123
Thank you, my good man.

28:29.015 --> 28:32.686
- Shh!
- It's only the wind.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.377
Where do you think it could be?

28:59.839 --> 29:02.508
Shut up!

29:03.343 --> 29:05.928
Sorry.

29:13.228 --> 29:15.647
Shh!

29:39.923 --> 29:43.050
John, would you check
the cellar, please?

29:43.051 --> 29:45.636
Yes, madam.

29:59.276 --> 30:00.943
John?

30:00.944 --> 30:04.739
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

30:04.740 --> 30:09.702
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

30:09.703 --> 30:12.581
Madam always feels
she's heard a noise.

30:12.582 --> 30:16.168
Come along now. I need
you to find my best pipe.

30:16.169 --> 30:20.506
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

30:20.923 --> 30:23.675
That was a close one.

30:23.676 --> 30:26.928
Didn't do my heart any
good, I'll say that.

30:26.929 --> 30:29.431
Mind the light!

30:29.432 --> 30:31.267
Here.

30:31.268 --> 30:36.606
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

30:36.607 --> 30:40.860
It's odd, though. I've never seen the
likes of that before, small as it is.

30:40.861 --> 30:45.615
Very delicate. It could be a lady's
twirl for some feminine trifle.

30:45.616 --> 30:48.201
Watch the light!

30:48.952 --> 30:54.250
It's not my fault you're having
trouble. It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

30:55.084 --> 30:57.919
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.798
Let's see how fast you can wax.

31:01.215 --> 31:03.508
Mind the light.

31:03.509 --> 31:06.095
Bastard.

31:18.901 --> 31:20.776
Beautiful, isn't it?

31:20.777 --> 31:23.363
Brilliant.

32:06.950 --> 32:08.826
What does this clause mean?

32:08.827 --> 32:11.788
Never mind that. What about
that one over there?

32:11.789 --> 32:13.498
In pink?

32:13.499 --> 32:17.419
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

32:17.420 --> 32:21.089
If she didn't provoke
a hasty withdrawal.

32:21.090 --> 32:23.550
Not on my account, I fancy.

32:23.551 --> 32:29.681
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's
minx and accustomed to hasty withdrawals!

32:29.682 --> 32:33.395
Quite without principle,
don't you think?

32:36.023 --> 32:38.608
But here now... I say!

32:43.155 --> 32:45.323
Monsieur, avez... Excuse-moi.

32:45.324 --> 32:47.658
Have you got my deposit account?

32:47.659 --> 32:53.040
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all!

32:53.041 --> 32:56.543
She gives good value,
long term or short.

32:56.544 --> 32:57.878
Eh?

32:57.879 --> 32:59.713
- You know her?
- Mm.

32:59.714 --> 33:04.051
Where have you been keeping
her, Edward, you rogue?

33:04.552 --> 33:09.723
She's a vision. Not at all
bad for a foreign woman.

33:11.351 --> 33:13.769
I don't think she's your type.

33:13.770 --> 33:17.106
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

33:17.107 --> 33:19.692
- Fowler.
- Trent.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.780
Will you make an introduction?

33:24.489 --> 33:28.034
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

33:28.035 --> 33:31.330
Well, I had arranged to
go to the theatre...

33:31.331 --> 33:35.292
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

33:38.296 --> 33:40.839
More than that, Henry.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.425
Much more.

33:55.355 --> 33:58.942
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

34:00.319 --> 34:02.904
That's all you have to say?

34:03.071 --> 34:05.448
It's the job, innit?

34:05.449 --> 34:09.952
I suppose you expect me to dab
it up with that fat, repulsive...

34:09.953 --> 34:13.540
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it!

34:13.541 --> 34:16.126
It's up to you, innit?

34:16.418 --> 34:19.004
Bloody hell!

34:46.533 --> 34:49.118
Shall we go, darling?

35:10.267 --> 35:12.018
Very nice.

35:12.019 --> 35:15.271
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

35:15.272 --> 35:17.106
Evening, gentlemen.

35:17.107 --> 35:20.943
How can I be of service to you?

35:20.944 --> 35:25.031
My friend would like to
see Madame Lucienne.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.951
Madame Lucienne?

35:28.952 --> 35:31.079
Madame Lucienne.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.958
She holds a very rigid standard.

35:34.750 --> 35:38.044
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

35:38.045 --> 35:40.631
Come this way.

35:53.729 --> 35:59.650
You go up the stairs, sir... and
through the first door on your right.

35:59.651 --> 36:02.236
Madame Lucienne will
be with you presently.

36:02.237 --> 36:04.822
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

36:33.854 --> 36:37.064
- Monsieur...?
- Er... Jones.

36:37.065 --> 36:38.691
Jones.

36:38.692 --> 36:42.487
I am very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

36:43.029 --> 36:44.822
I as well.

36:44.823 --> 36:46.282
You are nervous?

36:46.283 --> 36:50.370
No, I just thought we might
become... better acquainted.

36:50.371 --> 36:54.166
Oh, mon chÃ©ri, you are nervous.
There is no need to be.

36:54.167 --> 36:59.338
I will take care of
every little thing.

36:59.922 --> 37:03.675
And every big thing.

37:09.056 --> 37:11.267
Oh...

37:11.268 --> 37:14.938
Such a strong man!

37:15.439 --> 37:19.692
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

37:19.693 --> 37:22.320
Oh, but you are still young.

37:22.863 --> 37:24.989
And very strong.

37:24.990 --> 37:28.742
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

37:28.743 --> 37:32.790
The touch of flesh to flesh.

37:32.999 --> 37:35.584
The warmth of the body.

37:36.127 --> 37:39.671
- This is the French way, is it?
- Oui, mon cher.

37:40.256 --> 37:43.341
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

37:43.342 --> 37:47.470
Oh, there must be nothing...
nothing between us.

37:47.471 --> 37:50.057
Oh, yes.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.774
Now if you will sit on the lit.

37:58.775 --> 38:03.029
- The what?
- The lit... the bed, the bed, the bed.

38:06.908 --> 38:11.330
Oh, it is so exciting!

38:11.372 --> 38:14.875
You... How do you say...

38:15.626 --> 38:18.212
You inflame me.

38:19.088 --> 38:23.217
But, madame, do you not
remove your own clothing?

38:24.176 --> 38:26.928
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.431
In just a moment.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.937
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.523
Yes, yes, I will.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.706
Oh, my God, the police!

38:52.707 --> 38:55.084
Quel mess!

39:09.682 --> 39:12.059
Come on, Henry, for God's sake!

39:12.060 --> 39:14.646
I'm coming!

39:15.689 --> 39:18.440
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

39:18.441 --> 39:20.693
- But I could be ruined!
- Quite!

39:20.694 --> 39:23.279
I know the back way.

40:19.755 --> 40:22.882
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

40:22.883 --> 40:25.468
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

40:25.469 --> 40:30.934
But that's the devil's own crib. I've
watched it three days. Look there.

40:31.143 --> 40:35.563
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

40:35.564 --> 40:38.232
Then into that crib.
Anybody can see you.

40:38.233 --> 40:42.028
Bloody silly. Invitation
to prison, that place is.

40:42.404 --> 40:44.446
What's your pogue up there?

40:44.447 --> 40:47.784
Two Chubb keys in
that green cupboard.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.790
What might they be, them keys?

40:54.417 --> 40:57.920
Two keys that I happen to want.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.383
We're partners, aren't we?

41:03.384 --> 41:07.387
If you're trying to say that you
don't trust me completely...

41:07.388 --> 41:09.973
I don't trust you at all.

41:10.267 --> 41:12.476
Good.

41:12.477 --> 41:17.189
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

41:17.190 --> 41:20.443
What's in a station?
Trains is in a...

41:21.069 --> 41:24.071
Mother of God! You're
after the Crimean g...

41:24.072 --> 41:27.449
Trying to rob a moving
train... it can't be done.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.993
Why not?

41:28.994 --> 41:31.663
- It hasn't been done, has it?
- No.

41:31.664 --> 41:34.457
Crimean gold. Mother of God!

41:34.458 --> 41:39.170
That's Â£25,000, isn't it? A big
shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

41:39.171 --> 41:41.464
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

41:41.465 --> 41:43.341
Am I... Yes.

41:43.342 --> 41:45.760
Where's the chavy?

41:45.761 --> 41:48.347
There.

41:49.890 --> 41:52.101
He's your son.

41:52.102 --> 41:54.144
I don't have no son.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.105
Louisa says he's your son.

41:56.106 --> 41:58.107
Hmph! Louisa!

41:58.108 --> 42:00.484
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

42:00.485 --> 42:04.697
He's not my son. He's
too ugly to be my son!

42:06.324 --> 42:08.242
So what's the sweetener?

42:08.243 --> 42:10.829
A guinea.

42:10.955 --> 42:14.291
Well, if he is my son,
he'll be worth it.

42:21.632 --> 42:24.968
- Are we ready?
- Mm!

42:38.942 --> 42:43.779
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed!
- Stop thief! Stop that boy!

42:44.489 --> 42:47.074
Somebody stop him!

42:47.909 --> 42:50.494
Police! Stop that boy!

42:50.996 --> 42:53.582
Police! Stop that boy!

42:54.542 --> 42:56.960
Stop thief! Stop that boy!

42:56.961 --> 42:59.546
I've got him!

43:09.223 --> 43:13.102
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

43:14.104 --> 43:16.689
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:17.816 --> 43:20.234
Take that!

43:26.908 --> 43:29.493
Are you all right?

43:34.250 --> 43:36.835
Under! After him.

43:38.921 --> 43:40.922
Get off!

43:41.632 --> 43:45.302
Oh, my dear chap. Awfully
sorry. Are you all right?

43:51.685 --> 43:53.645
Gotcha!

44:03.655 --> 44:07.741
Well done. And thank
you, gentlemen.

44:07.742 --> 44:11.079
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

44:19.547 --> 44:23.299
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

44:23.300 --> 44:25.677
Never crack that crib.

44:25.678 --> 44:29.264
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

44:29.265 --> 44:32.143
- What about night?
- Night!

44:34.270 --> 44:37.106
I've marked this crib
for three nights.

44:37.107 --> 44:41.527
There's a jack at the top
of the stairs all night long.

44:46.950 --> 44:52.873
He talks to the constable making his
rounds... but he doesn't leave his post.

44:56.669 --> 45:00.797
Then at two o'clock he
takes his tightener.

45:23.113 --> 45:28.117
And right at 2.30 he goes off to
relieve himself from his bottle of beer.

45:28.118 --> 45:30.704
And that's when I time him.

45:32.706 --> 45:37.044
I time him from when he goes
off to when he comes back.

45:49.348 --> 45:54.520
And it's been the same... three nights
running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.

46:05.824 --> 46:08.409
75 seconds.

46:08.701 --> 46:10.745
It's a coopered ken.

46:10.746 --> 46:16.376
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

46:16.377 --> 46:22.174
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

46:22.508 --> 46:26.302
What if a snakesman comes over the
roof and cracks it from the inside?

46:26.303 --> 46:30.599
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.351
The best is Clean
Willy and he's in.

46:32.352 --> 46:34.728
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

46:34.729 --> 46:37.440
And there's no escaping that.

46:42.111 --> 46:44.905
Only Willy can climb that.

46:45.365 --> 46:47.742
Shame he's in Newgate.

47:39.004 --> 47:42.507
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

47:54.062 --> 47:57.481
Hello, dearie. Comin'
in for a good time?

47:57.482 --> 48:00.067
You won't be sorry.

48:26.386 --> 48:28.972
What's it to be, guv?

48:29.264 --> 48:31.266
Bit of a tickle for you?

48:31.267 --> 48:34.394
You dab it up with Clean
Willy the snakesman, right?

48:34.395 --> 48:36.980
I did. He's in Newgate now.

48:36.981 --> 48:38.607
You visit?

48:38.608 --> 48:40.609
I do now and again.

48:40.610 --> 48:43.820
I visits as his sister, see?

48:43.821 --> 48:47.407
There's another of those if
you can downy him a message.

48:47.408 --> 48:49.701
What's it to be?

48:49.702 --> 48:54.707
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate!

48:54.708 --> 48:58.461
Tell him he breaks at the next
topping or he's not Clean Willy.

48:58.462 --> 49:02.256
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

49:02.257 --> 49:04.634
John Simms.

49:07.971 --> 49:10.557
Are you John Simms?

49:35.918 --> 49:39.962
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

49:39.963 --> 49:44.175
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

49:44.218 --> 49:48.346
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

49:49.181 --> 49:51.767
Fine day for a hanging.

49:52.268 --> 49:55.646
Do you really think he'll make it?

49:56.147 --> 49:58.732
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

49:58.733 --> 50:00.817
- Medicine?
- Everything.

50:00.818 --> 50:03.153
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

50:03.154 --> 50:07.366
Willy's the best snakesman there is...
but he can't get out of there.

50:07.575 --> 50:10.912
Dearly beloved, wonder
not if the world hate you.

50:10.913 --> 50:15.666
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

50:15.667 --> 50:18.544
He that loveth not
abideth in death.

50:18.545 --> 50:21.380
Whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer.

50:21.381 --> 50:26.427
And you know that no murderer hath
eternal life abiding in himself.

50:26.428 --> 50:30.265
In this we have known
the charity of God.

51:06.595 --> 51:09.180
And in God's house...

51:14.854 --> 51:19.816
Goodness and mercy all my
life shall surely follow me...

51:19.817 --> 51:23.070
and in God's house forevermore...

51:24.030 --> 51:27.908
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

51:32.164 --> 51:35.041
They say Willy can
climb a wall of glass.

51:35.042 --> 51:38.295
If anyone can do it,
Clean Willy can.

52:32.852 --> 52:37.356
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

52:45.364 --> 52:47.950
Where is he?

54:17.336 --> 54:20.588
Good heavens! He's
in a right bad state.

54:20.589 --> 54:22.632
Here, come over here.

54:22.633 --> 54:25.468
Sit down.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.770
Cabinet open...

54:34.771 --> 54:37.564
- Cabinet shut.
- Cabinet shut.

54:37.732 --> 54:39.816
Door.

54:39.817 --> 54:42.403
Steps.

54:44.697 --> 54:46.364
Done!

54:46.365 --> 54:48.074
Time?

54:48.075 --> 54:50.076
81.

54:50.077 --> 54:53.164
Well... better than last time.

54:53.165 --> 54:54.498
Two seconds better.

54:54.499 --> 54:57.168
But you still haven't
broken the 75 seconds.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.587
Well, it is better.

54:59.588 --> 55:02.173
But not good enough.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.676
We'll try again later.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.263
Where are you going?

55:08.305 --> 55:10.807
But you're so tired.

55:10.808 --> 55:13.394
I'm not tired.

55:24.405 --> 55:26.531
Go!

55:26.532 --> 55:29.118
Steps.

55:30.203 --> 55:31.579
Door.

55:31.580 --> 55:34.624
- Cabinet open.
- Fastest bloody screwsman!

55:34.625 --> 55:36.959
Shut up. Time?

55:36.960 --> 55:37.793
31.

55:37.794 --> 55:40.046
Cabinet shut.

55:40.047 --> 55:42.048
Door.

55:42.049 --> 55:44.634
Steps.

55:45.594 --> 55:47.762
Time?

55:47.763 --> 55:50.348
74.

55:52.935 --> 55:54.895
74?

55:54.896 --> 55:57.147
74.

56:01.903 --> 56:04.488
I always knew I could do it.

59:30.620 --> 59:32.329
Psst!

59:32.330 --> 59:34.916
Psst!

59:44.092 --> 59:46.010
Shit!

59:55.938 --> 59:58.148
Jed? Jed?

59:58.149 --> 01:00:00.066
- Yes.
- All right?

01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:02.110
Oh, I'm well enough.

01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:04.195
You been at the fight?

01:00:04.196 --> 01:00:09.534
Hmph! Fancy Dan and Stunning
Bill. Wasn't my fight, was it?

01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:12.121
Put a sovereign on Bill.

01:00:14.374 --> 01:00:18.127
Well, he won! I've a
quid to show for it.

01:00:29.889 --> 01:00:33.352
I'll take another walk round.
See you later.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.305
75 seconds, remember?

01:01:20.359 --> 01:01:22.527
Now!

01:01:34.749 --> 01:01:36.375
13...

01:01:36.376 --> 01:01:38.586
14...

01:01:38.587 --> 01:01:40.588
15...

01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:42.756
16...

01:01:42.757 --> 01:01:44.842
17...

01:01:44.843 --> 01:01:46.719
18...

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.344
19...

01:01:47.345 --> 01:01:50.097
- Where are the bloody keys?
- 20.

01:01:50.098 --> 01:01:52.392
21...

01:01:52.393 --> 01:01:54.352
No Chubb keys.

01:01:54.353 --> 01:01:56.312
23...

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.356
24...

01:01:58.357 --> 01:02:00.233
- 25...
- Damn it!

01:02:00.234 --> 01:02:02.277
26...

01:02:02.278 --> 01:02:03.987
27...

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:05.613
28...

01:02:05.614 --> 01:02:07.574
29...

01:02:07.575 --> 01:02:09.033
30.

01:02:09.034 --> 01:02:11.120
31...

01:02:11.204 --> 01:02:13.289
32...

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.166
33...

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.335
34...

01:02:17.586 --> 01:02:19.545
35...

01:02:19.713 --> 01:02:21.672
36...

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.841
37...

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.927
38...

01:02:26.094 --> 01:02:28.095
39...

01:02:28.596 --> 01:02:30.348
40.

01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:32.308
41...

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:34.394
42...

01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:36.646
43...

01:02:36.647 --> 01:02:38.773
44...

01:02:38.774 --> 01:02:40.901
45...

01:02:41.068 --> 01:02:43.070
46...

01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:45.238
47...

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.198
48...

01:02:47.199 --> 01:02:49.159
49...

01:02:49.326 --> 01:02:51.036
50.

01:02:51.037 --> 01:02:53.205
51...

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.208
52...

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:57.251
53...

01:02:57.252 --> 01:02:59.169
54...

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.255
55...

01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:03.340
56...

01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:05.051
57...

01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:07.220
58...

01:03:07.345 --> 01:03:09.180
59...

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:11.391
60!

01:03:11.392 --> 01:03:13.393
61...

01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:15.437
62...

01:03:15.438 --> 01:03:17.272
63...

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.107
64...

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:21.026
65...

01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:23.194
66...

01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:25.154
67...

01:03:25.155 --> 01:03:27.031
68...

01:03:27.032 --> 01:03:29.033
69...

01:03:29.034 --> 01:03:30.494
70.

01:03:30.495 --> 01:03:32.079
71...

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.956
72...

01:03:33.957 --> 01:03:35.833
73...

01:03:35.834 --> 01:03:37.751
74...

01:03:37.752 --> 01:03:40.171
75!

01:03:53.853 --> 01:03:56.480
I remember when we first met.

01:03:56.856 --> 01:04:01.026
I gave the most awful performance
in Way of The World.

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:06.739
I went to my dressing room and there were
the beautiful flowers you'd sent me.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.326
And then you walked in.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:10.953
- Flowers?
- Mm.

01:04:10.954 --> 01:04:13.956
Dozens of them.
They were wonderful.

01:04:13.957 --> 01:04:17.251
I didn't send any. Must
have been someone else.

01:04:17.252 --> 01:04:19.962
I walked in and you thanked me.

01:04:20.296 --> 01:04:22.506
You're teasing me.

01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:25.760
Bloody waste of good
money, flowers.

01:04:27.345 --> 01:04:29.931
- You didn't?
- No.

01:04:35.062 --> 01:04:37.647
Really?

01:04:41.402 --> 01:04:43.987
Really?

01:04:44.238 --> 01:04:47.866
I had them at a good price.
I robbed a grave.

01:04:51.663 --> 01:04:54.665
All you ever think about is money.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.586
All anyone ever thinks
about is money.

01:05:22.611 --> 01:05:24.445
Don't turn.

01:05:24.446 --> 01:05:26.572
- Mr Simms, is it?
- That's right.

01:05:26.573 --> 01:05:29.909
- You came alone?
- Yes, as you instructed.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:33.288
- Everything the same on the railway line?
- All the same.

01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:34.832
Then it'll be tomorrow.

01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:39.002
- What'll be tomorrow?
- Never you mind. Here's 100 quid for you.

01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:41.588
Look the other way
and shut your mouth.

01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:44.258
- Right?
- Right, sir.

01:05:44.259 --> 01:05:47.345
Now, off you go and
don't look back.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.401
Get a bowl of water in there.

01:06:02.695 --> 01:06:04.988
Put it in the corner, over there.

01:06:04.989 --> 01:06:07.281
As far away from me as you can.

01:06:07.282 --> 01:06:11.037
- He's pretty heavy, ain't he?
- Pretty hungry too.

01:06:14.249 --> 01:06:17.084
Sorry, sir. No one's
allowed to ride in the van.

01:06:17.085 --> 01:06:21.005
I've got to accompany the
animal. It's very valuable.

01:06:24.467 --> 01:06:27.177
He gets upset if I'm not with him.

01:06:27.178 --> 01:06:29.764
Yeah, very well.

01:06:41.068 --> 01:06:43.653
Doesn't care for travel.

01:06:49.952 --> 01:06:53.080
- You mean it's to be you?
- Aye.

01:06:55.959 --> 01:07:00.337
Where'd you make them impressions?
They keep all them keys separate.

01:07:00.338 --> 01:07:02.923
- Do they?
- Aye, they do.

01:07:03.007 --> 01:07:05.593
How'd you pull 'em?

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.346
With incredible skill.

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:39.336
The next gold shipment is in
a week. This time we take it.

01:07:39.337 --> 01:07:43.048
Agar will replace the gold
with these lead bars...

01:07:43.049 --> 01:07:45.884
and throw the bags from
the train at Romney,...

01:07:45.885 --> 01:07:50.223
where Barlow will collect them
and then drive to Folkestone.

01:07:50.224 --> 01:07:51.766
Where will we be?

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:56.187
In a first-class compartment
enjoying the journey.

01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:58.356
What happens afterward?

01:07:58.357 --> 01:08:00.858
We divide the gold as agreed.

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:03.277
After that.

01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:07.157
- After that?
- Yes, after that!

01:08:12.247 --> 01:08:14.832
You and I will go to Paris.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:29.638
You have it all worked out. We ride
on the train and they do the work.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:33.309
They have to earn their
share, don't they?

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.895
It's all very smooth.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.691
Unless something goes wrong.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.026
What could go wrong?

01:08:42.027 --> 01:08:44.404
My dear Mr Simms.

01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:47.032
As your humble servant,...

01:08:47.448 --> 01:08:51.328
I would be greatly
obliged and indebted...

01:08:51.955 --> 01:08:57.167
if you could contrive to meet with
me at the Palace, Sydenham...

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:00.046
for the purpose...

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.716
For the purpose...

01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:07.928
For the purpose of discussing
some matters of...

01:09:07.929 --> 01:09:10.013
mutual interest.

01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:12.600
Most respectfully,...

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.312
William Williams, Esquire.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.607
That should do it.

01:09:19.983 --> 01:09:22.569
Well now, Willy...

01:09:22.653 --> 01:09:25.113
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

01:09:25.113 --> 01:09:27.448
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:31.662
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:34.247
I don't want to go
back to prison, sir.

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:36.834
Well, then. Better tell us.

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:39.545
I don't know, sir. I told you.

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:43.924
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

01:09:43.925 --> 01:09:46.510
The letter will put you on to him.

01:09:51.767 --> 01:09:53.935
We'll see.

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:56.521
They'll kill me, they will.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.609
Then see you aren't
running off again, eh?

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:06.614
We'll have a look at this
mysterious Mr Simms.

01:10:49.368 --> 01:10:51.829
Don't turn round, Willy.

01:10:57.085 --> 01:11:01.088
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

01:11:02.006 --> 01:11:06.218
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

01:11:06.886 --> 01:11:10.973
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

01:11:10.974 --> 01:11:14.394
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:23.027
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:27.657
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:31.912
There's a finny in your pocket.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.998
You're sweating.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:38.835
If you've turned nose on
me, I'll see you in lavender.

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:41.255
Not me, sir. I swear!

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:49.638
Three crushers.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:11.954
Edward! Edward Pierce!

01:12:12.664 --> 01:12:16.500
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:19.086
I got married.

01:12:19.295 --> 01:12:21.881
Must dash.

01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:29.721
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:34.477
Very rough man. Not
a good sort at all.

01:16:03.487 --> 01:16:07.364
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

01:16:07.365 --> 01:16:11.620
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:14.456
And we don't know who
he is or what he intends?

01:16:14.457 --> 01:16:17.709
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:23.548
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

01:16:23.549 --> 01:16:27.218
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

01:16:27.219 --> 01:16:31.223
Quite. But we do know Simms is a
safecracker. He must be after safes.

01:16:31.224 --> 01:16:36.228
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:38.647
Hmm.

01:16:38.648 --> 01:16:43.903
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:46.698
Steal from a moving railway train?

01:16:47.282 --> 01:16:49.533
Who could imagine such a thing?

01:16:49.534 --> 01:16:51.912
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

01:16:51.913 --> 01:16:55.832
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:59.169
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:03.590
I will ride the train to Folkestone
tonight. I shall be there tomorrow...

01:17:03.591 --> 01:17:06.843
in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:10.639
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:14.393
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

01:17:14.394 --> 01:17:15.978
New lock.

01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:21.567
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

01:17:21.568 --> 01:17:23.861
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

01:17:23.862 --> 01:17:27.448
I must commend you on your
attention in this matter.

01:17:27.449 --> 01:17:31.328
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

01:17:46.844 --> 01:17:51.307
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

01:17:51.308 --> 01:17:55.686
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

01:17:55.687 --> 01:17:58.522
And they've got a new
jack on the platform...

01:17:58.523 --> 01:18:01.609
who opens all parcels large
enough for a man to hide in.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:07.198
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a lock on the luggage van door.

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:13.455
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:17.584
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

01:18:18.044 --> 01:18:21.296
Bloody outside lock! It can't
be worked from within.

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:24.549
Even if I was to be able
to get inside the van...

01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:28.511
I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

01:18:28.512 --> 01:18:34.143
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

01:18:34.227 --> 01:18:36.479
Two plainclothes
jacks were there...

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.983
saying as how a Mr Simms was
planning to rob the Crimean gold.

01:18:40.984 --> 01:18:45.654
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

01:18:45.655 --> 01:18:50.911
And they've put crushers on every
station on the line and at Folkestone.

01:18:50.912 --> 01:18:53.664
So. Here we are.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:19:00.545
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

01:19:00.546 --> 01:19:06.092
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold
out as the door's locked from the outside.

01:19:06.093 --> 01:19:09.054
So what's it to have
four keys, I ask you?

01:19:09.055 --> 01:19:13.225
Four keys or 40 keys... it don't
make no bloody difference!

01:19:13.226 --> 01:19:17.313
It's a waste, the whole thing!
And nothing to be done about it.

01:19:17.314 --> 01:19:21.275
All on account of they found you
out, Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

01:19:21.276 --> 01:19:26.364
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

01:19:31.579 --> 01:19:34.164
Find me a dead cat.

01:20:05.864 --> 01:20:08.240
Now then, missy, now then.

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:11.119
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.039
The man is a
heartless beast, he is.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.292
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

01:20:17.293 --> 01:20:21.213
He will not let me set my
dear brother on the train.

01:20:22.006 --> 01:20:24.758
He says it must be...

01:20:24.759 --> 01:20:26.384
opened!

01:20:26.385 --> 01:20:29.637
Why... the cruel rogue.

01:20:29.638 --> 01:20:32.558
We'll have your
brother on the train.

01:20:34.936 --> 01:20:36.562
There's, um...

01:20:36.563 --> 01:20:39.148
no need to open it.

01:20:43.236 --> 01:20:47.031
I, um... I see you have
a Bateson's belfry here.

01:20:47.032 --> 01:20:49.199
Oh, yes, sir.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:55.666
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of
being buried alive, so here's the safety.

01:20:56.667 --> 01:21:01.755
Very thoughtful, I'm sure. Just
you dry your eyes. All will be well.

01:21:02.506 --> 01:21:04.883
Thank you, sir.

01:21:04.884 --> 01:21:08.220
I'll just... get this
business finished.

01:21:12.642 --> 01:21:16.604
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:20.817
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

01:21:21.067 --> 01:21:26.030
Do you smell it? I think in this
case we can make an exception.

01:21:26.031 --> 01:21:27.323
Whatever you say.

01:21:27.324 --> 01:21:29.199
- Nephew!
- Uncle.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.785
Nephew,...

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:35.665
mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception. No exception.

01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:37.627
Yes, Uncle.

01:21:38.878 --> 01:21:42.714
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The, er...

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:50.013
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

01:21:51.933 --> 01:21:55.478
- See that you open it.
- But, er... Uncle...

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:59.565
No stomach for it, eh?

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:02.777
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

01:22:03.194 --> 01:22:05.404
All right, I'll do it myself.

01:22:05.405 --> 01:22:07.990
For opened it must be.

01:22:10.453 --> 01:22:12.328
Oh! Oh!

01:22:12.329 --> 01:22:16.082
My dear brother! Oh,
Richard. Richard, he lives!

01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:18.460
He lives! Oh, he's alive!

01:22:18.461 --> 01:22:22.255
Oh, make haste. He's alive!
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

01:22:22.256 --> 01:22:23.965
Oh, he's alive!

01:22:23.966 --> 01:22:26.384
Hurry! Hurry! Lest we are too late.

01:22:26.385 --> 01:22:28.803
I knew it was not cholera!

01:22:28.804 --> 01:22:30.347
Cholera?

01:22:30.348 --> 01:22:33.893
He was a quack to say it.
I knew it! Hurry. Hurry.

01:22:33.894 --> 01:22:39.190
- Five days I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five days?

01:22:39.733 --> 01:22:42.318
Richard! Richard!

01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:45.196
Ohh!

01:22:45.905 --> 01:22:48.491
Oh, no!

01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:01.588
Oh...

01:23:01.589 --> 01:23:05.342
How can it be? I heard the bell.

01:23:05.718 --> 01:23:08.178
Did you not?

01:23:08.179 --> 01:23:10.765
I heard it plain.

01:23:10.974 --> 01:23:12.766
The bell rang.

01:23:12.767 --> 01:23:16.896
No, missy. A gust of wind
or a tremor on the ground.

01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:19.273
I'm sorry.

01:23:19.274 --> 01:23:21.483
But I heard it.

01:23:21.484 --> 01:23:24.486
Load this on. Sharp now!

01:23:24.487 --> 01:23:26.739
Come along.

01:23:26.948 --> 01:23:29.534
Steady. Steady now.

01:23:29.743 --> 01:23:32.329
Stand aside there.

01:23:32.538 --> 01:23:34.664
Careful.

01:23:34.665 --> 01:23:36.958
That's right.

01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:40.920
Over here. A little to
your right. Set it down.

01:23:40.921 --> 01:23:46.175
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

01:23:46.176 --> 01:23:48.177
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

01:23:48.178 --> 01:23:53.059
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate!

01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:58.314
Oh, the stench!

01:24:49.909 --> 01:24:53.079
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.165
It's a long way back there.

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:59.669
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:01.170
I'll manage.

01:25:01.171 --> 01:25:05.383
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

01:25:05.676 --> 01:25:07.010
Edward!

01:25:07.011 --> 01:25:11.181
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler!

01:25:11.182 --> 01:25:13.726
He cannot travel in
our compartment.

01:25:13.727 --> 01:25:16.061
Henry, what a surprise!

01:25:16.062 --> 01:25:19.440
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

01:25:19.441 --> 01:25:21.734
As a matter of fact, so am I.

01:25:23.611 --> 01:25:28.908
Oh, forgive me. Miss Bridget
Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.037
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother but...

01:25:33.038 --> 01:25:37.542
due to the new regulations she's
not permitted in the guard's van.

01:25:37.543 --> 01:25:41.046
Therefore she is
seeking a compartment.

01:25:42.339 --> 01:25:44.716
Well, mine is available.

01:25:46.468 --> 01:25:49.513
Henry, you're so kind.

01:25:51.266 --> 01:25:53.726
You won't join us, will you?

01:25:54.144 --> 01:25:58.272
As a matter of fact, I've...
made other arrangements.

01:26:00.066 --> 01:26:02.651
Oh, I see!

01:26:02.652 --> 01:26:06.280
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

01:26:06.281 --> 01:26:08.866
You carry on, Henry.

01:26:13.747 --> 01:26:15.373
Miss Lawson!

01:26:15.374 --> 01:26:18.668
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:21.671
Not at all.

01:27:15.562 --> 01:27:18.522
Open up! Open up!

01:27:18.523 --> 01:27:21.108
Open up, damn you!

01:27:22.402 --> 01:27:24.194
Are you alive, then?

01:27:24.195 --> 01:27:26.697
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

01:27:26.698 --> 01:27:30.911
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick!

01:27:33.914 --> 01:27:36.207
Lift up!

01:27:36.208 --> 01:27:38.794
Oh, mother of God!

01:27:39.128 --> 01:27:41.713
Oh, the smell!

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:45.133
The things I must do!

01:27:48.971 --> 01:27:52.808
Do you have, er...
many gentlemen friends?

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:58.438
Oh, why sure enough. Gents are
ever so friendly to me, they are.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:01.775
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:07.781
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.200
Many a caller.

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:13.246
And always with some little token.

01:28:13.247 --> 01:28:16.708
Me mum says a man loves
you, he shows you proper.

01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:20.253
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:25.759
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a "token" myself.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:31.640
- Cor, you're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:35.018
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:38.772
Have you not heard of the
50-mile-an-hour club?

01:28:38.773 --> 01:28:42.651
I'm told it's beneficial
to the circulation.

01:28:56.959 --> 01:29:00.128
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

01:29:00.129 --> 01:29:02.839
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.009
My friend will come over the top of the
train between Redhill and Ashford.

01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:10.263
That's the fastest part of the run!

01:29:10.264 --> 01:29:12.850
I suppose it is.

01:29:12.934 --> 01:29:17.188
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

01:34:59.586 --> 01:35:02.380
- What's going on?
- Take the rope.

01:35:06.009 --> 01:35:08.386
- Is he up there now?
- He is.

01:35:08.387 --> 01:35:10.680
He's lucky to be alive.

01:35:10.681 --> 01:35:14.602
- Hold on.
- All right.

01:35:22.068 --> 01:35:24.653
Now let it go easy.

01:35:24.695 --> 01:35:27.281
Go on.

01:36:01.859 --> 01:36:04.653
I can't get over the feeling...

01:36:05.112 --> 01:36:07.197
You look very familiar.

01:36:07.198 --> 01:36:11.619
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

01:36:13.664 --> 01:36:15.873
What does your mum do?

01:36:15.874 --> 01:36:18.668
Me mum? Er...

01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:21.254
She's a seamstress.

01:36:22.172 --> 01:36:24.757
An honourable trade.

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:30.722
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

01:36:32.892 --> 01:36:35.853
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

01:36:36.646 --> 01:36:38.981
Oh.

01:37:14.268 --> 01:37:16.353
- All done?
- Done.

01:37:16.354 --> 01:37:20.149
Good. We've got less than a minute.

01:37:29.492 --> 01:37:32.161
Bloody hell, you look a sight!

01:37:32.162 --> 01:37:34.205
I look a sight?

01:37:34.206 --> 01:37:37.292
No, but you're all covered in soot.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.962
It's the smoke.

01:37:41.963 --> 01:37:45.633
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant.

01:37:45.634 --> 01:37:50.388
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:53.725
Oh, no!

01:37:53.726 --> 01:37:56.102
Oh, no!

01:37:56.103 --> 01:38:02.025
Bloody hell! You paint me green, make
me lie in a coffin with a dead cat...

01:38:02.026 --> 01:38:04.486
and now you strip
me bollock-naked. No!

01:38:04.487 --> 01:38:06.488
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

01:38:06.489 --> 01:38:08.740
Let's go!

01:38:27.427 --> 01:38:31.765
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

01:38:40.691 --> 01:38:46.405
Take hold of the rope. We'll be
through Ashford soon. Pull it.

01:38:49.992 --> 01:38:52.579
We'll pass Ashford soon.

01:41:05.634 --> 01:41:08.219
Best lock me up.

01:41:08.428 --> 01:41:12.808
- Sweet dreams.
- Not bloody likely.

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:35.748
Me mum told me the best gents were the
ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

01:41:35.957 --> 01:41:43.214
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

01:41:43.423 --> 01:41:45.257
- Whips?
- Mm!

01:41:45.258 --> 01:41:47.426
Can you imagine!

01:41:47.427 --> 01:41:49.261
Mmm.

01:41:49.262 --> 01:41:53.934
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

01:41:54.393 --> 01:41:55.643
Oh!

01:41:55.644 --> 01:41:58.230
What a man you are!

01:41:59.482 --> 01:42:01.399
What do you take me for?

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.860
Aagh!

01:42:05.821 --> 01:42:08.407
Ohh!

01:43:04.215 --> 01:43:07.260
Impossible woman!

01:43:26.572 --> 01:43:27.488
Ha!

01:43:27.489 --> 01:43:31.160
Robbery indeed! The very idea!

01:44:53.163 --> 01:44:55.748
Arrest that man!

01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:29.365
The court thanks you for providing
us with so clear an explanation...

01:45:29.366 --> 01:45:32.036
of your manner in
committing the crime.

01:45:32.037 --> 01:45:35.831
I'm glad to be of help. The
police seemed to be confused.

01:45:35.832 --> 01:45:39.626
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

01:45:39.627 --> 01:45:43.005
Your presence here attests
to their efficiency.

01:45:43.006 --> 01:45:45.966
You know, you are a
very unusual man.

01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:49.095
Mr Pierce, I put it
to you directly.

01:45:49.304 --> 01:45:53.224
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,...

01:45:53.225 --> 01:45:55.894
some recognition of misconduct,...

01:45:55.895 --> 01:46:01.774
some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings...

01:46:01.775 --> 01:46:06.154
in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

01:46:06.155 --> 01:46:10.617
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

01:46:10.702 --> 01:46:14.663
Sir, it is a recognised
truth of jurisprudence...

01:46:14.664 --> 01:46:17.416
that laws are created by men...

01:46:17.417 --> 01:46:21.462
and that civilised men, in a tradition
of more than two millennia,...

01:46:21.463 --> 01:46:26.758
agree to abide by these laws for
the common good of all society.

01:46:26.759 --> 01:46:28.760
For it is only by
the rule of law...

01:46:28.761 --> 01:46:35.560
that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

01:46:35.561 --> 01:46:39.105
Now, on the matter
of motive, we ask you:

01:46:39.106 --> 01:46:43.450
why did you conceive,
plan and execute...

01:46:43.451 --> 01:46:47.347
this dastardly and
scandalous crime?

01:46:52.454 --> 01:46:55.039
I wanted the money.

01:47:05.216 --> 01:47:07.802
He'll get 20 years for that.

01:47:55.311 --> 01:47:58.104
What the hell are you waiting for?
