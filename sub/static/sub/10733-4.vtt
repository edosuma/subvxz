00:18.881 --> 00:21.126
Still not working right, Blukic!

00:21.162 --> 00:23.441
Set it on "stun," we get "blast!"

00:23.476 --> 00:26.548
Set it on "blast," we get a
low-battery warning!

00:26.618 --> 00:29.625
The knob is on upside down, Driba.

00:29.660 --> 00:32.962
And who's job was that?!
- Um, yours.

00:32.997 --> 00:35.101
Was not.
- Was too.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.802
<i>- Was not!
- Was too.</i>

00:39.337 --> 00:43.344
Ah, come on, guys.
Are we done here?

00:43.379 --> 00:44.913
I thought Galvans were supposed

00:44.949 --> 00:47.917
to be the smartest beings in
the universe ... "smart," as in

00:47.952 --> 00:52.126
"figure stuff out quickly so that
Ben Tennyson can go home" smart.

00:52.195 --> 00:55.028
Har, har, Ben Tennyson.
We may not look it...

00:55.064 --> 00:58.199
But we're still smarter than any human!
[blaster powers up]

00:58.268 --> 01:00.670
I have yet to see any
indication of that.

01:02.442 --> 01:05.209
Why did we hire you guys again?

01:05.278 --> 01:08.047
You called control-unit
fabrication.

01:08.115 --> 01:12.185
I call it, but you did it!
- You did it!

01:13.021 --> 01:15.890

this. I need to see him now.</i>

01:54.667 --> 01:56.900
<i>I'm going in.
[rumbling]</i>

01:58.070 --> 02:02.840
Azmuth, I can't take it anymore.
You've got to do something about Ben.

02:02.908 --> 02:05.844
As you can see,
I'm exceedingly busy.

02:05.913 --> 02:07.847
Albedo, modify power cycles.

02:07.916 --> 02:10.917
I made an appointment.
I made 10.

02:10.985 --> 02:14.354
Ooh!
You keep postponing!

02:14.389 --> 02:18.025
First-thinker Azmuth has told
you he's busy, human.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.828
Accept it.
- Accept this!

02:20.896 --> 02:24.899
One of you is helping me with
the Ben situation now!

02:24.934 --> 02:28.569
Low priority.
Come back in two years.

02:28.638 --> 02:31.206
Whoa! Cool!
What's this?!

02:31.274 --> 02:32.941
What's that do?!

02:33.777 --> 02:35.110
Whoa. That's heavy!

02:35.179 --> 02:36.312
What's that?! Neat!

02:36.380 --> 02:39.682
I told you kids to wait
in the Skipper.

02:39.717 --> 02:40.649
I tried!

02:40.684 --> 02:43.919
But Ben was all, "I got to see
the lab! I got to see the lab!"

02:43.955 --> 02:45.487
This place is awesome!

02:45.556 --> 02:49.324
Did you see that hula-hoop thing?!
It makes lightning!

02:49.360 --> 02:52.294
This is what I've been
dealing with.

02:52.329 --> 02:54.129
The Omnitrix is malfunctioning.

02:54.198 --> 02:57.232
Ben's been trapped as
a different alien every week.

02:57.301 --> 03:02.104
Not my concern.
- I haven't slept in a month.

03:02.139 --> 03:03.939
Hey!
- Whoops!

03:03.974 --> 03:05.674
[laughs nervously]
Sorry!

03:05.710 --> 03:08.844
Not so funny when he's
messing with your stuff, is it?

03:10.147 --> 03:12.114
Very well.

03:16.986 --> 03:19.788
Aw, man!
Fun's over!

03:19.824 --> 03:21.690
Thank goodness.

03:21.759 --> 03:25.761
It's been so long I almost
forgot what you look like, doofus!

03:25.797 --> 03:27.296
Ma-a-a-a-h!

03:27.331 --> 03:30.867
Oh!
Now I recognize you.

03:31.102 --> 03:35.071
Sit quietly. I need
to have a word with Azmuth.

03:35.106 --> 03:36.439
Gwen, watch him.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.174
I'm in charge?
Score!

03:41.887 --> 03:43.714
Doofus!
Doofus!

03:43.782 --> 03:45.882
Knock, knock!
Who's there?

03:45.918 --> 03:47.885
Ben's a doofus!

04:00.498 --> 04:03.900
You, Galvanic Mechamorph
subspecies, you are forbidden

04:03.936 --> 04:07.638
from entering the city.
You're to stay on Galvan B until ...

04:07.706 --> 04:10.073
Ohh!
Ohh!

04:11.309 --> 04:15.612
I am not a subspecies!

04:19.616 --> 04:24.720
Alert! Galvanic Mechamorph
subspecies approaching city.

04:34.162 --> 04:36.631
Whoa!
What's going on out there?

04:36.666 --> 04:40.735
Don't even think about it.
You heard what Grandpa Max said.

04:40.770 --> 04:43.338
Probably just alien Mardi Gras
or something.

04:43.373 --> 04:49.177
You think? Like a carnival?
Or a parade?

04:49.212 --> 04:52.647
Anything's got to be
more fun than just sitting here.

04:52.716 --> 04:54.716
I am totally telling Grandpa.

04:54.751 --> 04:58.353
Then this better be worth it.

05:12.232 --> 05:17.035
Come on, kids.
Let's go home.

05:17.071 --> 05:21.907
Gwen, where's your cousin?
- I told him not to go.

05:26.946 --> 05:31.750
Azmuth, I am coming for you!

05:31.785 --> 05:34.185
You are so not.

05:43.262 --> 05:46.965
The Omnitrix.
I want it!

05:47.033 --> 05:50.835
You and everybody
else, dude. Take a number.

05:58.377 --> 06:01.480
I'll take that energy, thank you.

06:01.515 --> 06:04.415
I don't call this guy "Feedback"
for nothing.

06:18.263 --> 06:23.500
Okay? I was hoping
for Diamondhead, but this will do.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.433
Ben!

06:55.502 --> 06:59.437
I can... take him.
Just need to rest for a second.

07:03.676 --> 07:05.643
Azmuth?!

07:09.048 --> 07:10.882
Malware, this is not the way.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.284
You promised me an upgrade!

07:13.320 --> 07:15.721
You said you'd make me like the others!

07:15.756 --> 07:17.423
Your condition is complex.

07:17.458 --> 07:20.192
It has taken more time than I
anticipated to ...

07:20.227 --> 07:23.195
No!
No more time!

07:23.264 --> 07:25.564
I've had enough of your lies!

07:25.633 --> 07:28.201
How dare you speak
to Azmuth that way.

07:28.269 --> 07:31.037
He has been working tirelessly to create

07:31.038 --> 07:33.806
a secondary Helix
specifically to treat you.

07:33.842 --> 07:36.742
Give it to me...
now!

07:38.279 --> 07:41.747
A creature of your low intellect
could never understand its

07:41.816 --> 07:44.016
workings well enough to operate it.

07:47.055 --> 07:49.255
The second Helix is not finished.

07:49.291 --> 07:54.094
To use it in its uncompleted form
could cause untold destruction.

07:54.129 --> 07:56.463
I need more time to help you.

07:56.532 --> 08:01.302
No!
Your time is up!

08:03.774 --> 08:05.106
Stop!

08:11.614 --> 08:14.517
So, friend of yours?

08:22.306 --> 08:23.840
This is hopeless!

08:23.909 --> 08:26.843
Malware flew off the planet!
He could be anywhere!

08:26.912 --> 08:30.680
Not necessarily.
He doesn't have FTL capability.

08:30.749 --> 08:33.783
Awesome!
Uh... what's FTL again?

08:33.852 --> 08:36.785
"Faster than light."
Duh!

08:36.854 --> 08:39.221
Oh!
And that's good because...

08:39.256 --> 08:43.659
Because he can't have
left the Galvan system... yet.

08:43.693 --> 08:47.028
Which means we can track
him... if we're lucky.

08:47.064 --> 08:50.665
We don't need luck. He's
headed for the moon Galvan B.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.236
And you know this how?
- That's a long story.

08:54.271 --> 08:58.873
Tell it on the way.
Get in. You too, Ben.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.519
<i>Galactic infant restraint engaged.</i>

09:10.789 --> 09:12.221
Not you, Gwen.

09:12.257 --> 09:14.057
What?!
Why not?!

09:14.126 --> 09:16.226
Oh! Oh!
I know! I know!

09:16.262 --> 09:19.430
'Cause you're a nerd?
'Cause you're a girl?

09:19.465 --> 09:21.432
That's enough, Ben!

09:21.501 --> 09:24.168
Sorry, Gwen.
The Skipper only holds three.

09:24.203 --> 09:26.537
Azmuth doesn't even
take up a whole seat.

09:26.606 --> 09:28.405
But you know who does?

09:28.441 --> 09:32.076
That's right.
Yours truly.

09:33.112 --> 09:36.997
<i>Galvan B was once much like
Earth's moon ...</i>

09:36.998 --> 09:41.584
<i>miles of dead rock, no
atmosphere, no day or night.</i>

09:41.619 --> 09:44.254
Sounds like a boring place.

09:44.322 --> 09:47.790
<i>It was the perfect
environment to conduct</i>

09:47.826 --> 09:53.863
<i>a planet-wide experiment ...
a place upon which life would thrive.</i>

10:14.819 --> 10:18.021
<i>The results were beyond anything
I could have hoped for.</i>

10:18.090 --> 10:20.623
<i>Not only was Galvan B
inhabitable, but ...</i>

10:20.659 --> 10:23.360
<i>Ugh, there's always a
"but" with you.</i>

10:23.428 --> 10:25.428
<i>You sure you're as smart as you think?</i>

10:25.464 --> 10:30.900
<i>Smarter. But there was
an unforeseen consequence.</i>

10:34.072 --> 10:37.641
<i>My experiment had inadvertently
prompted the creation of</i>

10:37.710 --> 10:42.546
<i>a brand-new technorganic species
... the Galvanic Mechamorphs.</i>

10:47.452 --> 10:51.121
<i>We Galvan had no right to
colonize their world.</i>

10:51.190 --> 10:54.291
<i>Instead, we gave it to them.</i>

10:54.326 --> 10:59.096
<i>With our help, they built an
entire civilization in mere days.</i>

10:59.131 --> 11:02.132
<i>They were peaceful new neighbors.</i>

11:02.200 --> 11:05.936
<i>My Helix experiment was a
success beyond my wildest</i>

11:06.004 --> 11:11.408
<i>dreams and a failure beyond my
wildest nightmares.</i>

11:29.561 --> 11:34.031
<i>Malware ... an incomplete
Mechamorph ... its life code</i>

11:34.066 --> 11:39.303
<i>interrupted, corrupted during creation.
Unlike all the others of his kind,</i>

11:39.338 --> 11:43.039
<i>Malware had the ability to
not just mimic tech.</i>

11:43.108 --> 11:48.211
<i>It became him, but at a terrible price.</i>

11:52.182 --> 11:56.319
<i>I've tried many times to help
him, to make him like the others.</i>

11:56.354 --> 12:00.123
Malware's condition is
intriguingly complex,

12:00.124 --> 12:03.893
and his volatile nature
is... challenging.

12:03.929 --> 12:07.163
So a dangerous tech
vampire has been begging you to

12:07.199 --> 12:10.400
fix him for years, and you told
him you'd get around to it?

12:10.435 --> 12:14.170
You have no idea of the
responsibilities I carry, Ben Tennyson.

12:14.239 --> 12:18.708
Blah, blah, blah. You goofed
up, and now you need me to fix it.

12:18.744 --> 12:21.611
I don't know if it's
that simple, Ben.

12:21.647 --> 12:23.079
<i>There you are!</i>

12:24.015 --> 12:25.448
Gwen?
How'd you do that?

12:25.517 --> 12:28.250
<i>Just borrowing some of
Azmuth's equipment.</i>

12:28.286 --> 12:31.154
I'm a nerd, remember?
- You got that right.

12:31.223 --> 12:34.725
[groans]
Kids, we need to focus.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.628
We've got a potential disaster
on our hands here.

12:37.696 --> 12:40.164
Indeed.
I believe Malware is going to

12:40.199 --> 12:45.970
link the old Helix with the new one he
stole to try to rewrite his life code.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.073
Isn't that what you were
trying to do?

12:48.108 --> 12:50.442
Yes, but not this way.

12:50.511 --> 12:52.811
<i>They use different
kinds of energy.</i>

12:52.879 --> 12:56.915
<i>And if anything goes wrong, there's
gonna be a really big "boom."</i>

12:56.984 --> 13:00.251
That's amazing!
Gwen found a way to make herself

13:00.287 --> 13:02.821
even more annoying and geeky!

13:02.856 --> 13:06.157
Blah!

13:13.299 --> 13:15.366
Are they... dead?

13:15.435 --> 13:18.102
Not yet.
They've been corroded and

13:18.138 --> 13:21.006
withered nearly to the point of
nonexistence.

13:22.576 --> 13:24.109
Can you help them?

13:24.178 --> 13:28.080
Only if I act immediately. I
need to use your ship's power supply.

13:28.115 --> 13:30.916
If I am to save these
Mechamorphs, I'm afraid you'll

13:30.952 --> 13:33.185
have to face Malware without me.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.466
We'll have to hit him
hard and fast.

13:46.501 --> 13:47.767
<i>What can I do, Grandpa?</i>

13:47.802 --> 13:50.570
You can run the
Skipper's systems remotely.

13:50.605 --> 13:53.039
Help Azmuth.
Ben and I will... Ben?!

13:53.108 --> 13:58.110
<i>He ditched you, didn't he?</i>

13:58.145 --> 13:59.844
Stop where you are, son.

13:59.913 --> 14:03.314
You can't run in half-cocked.
We need a plan.

14:03.350 --> 14:07.385
Oh, I've got a plan.
It's called "hero time"!

14:12.190 --> 14:16.493
Oh, yeah!
Get ready to roast, Malware!

14:19.497 --> 14:23.500
Do it!
I want my upgrade now!

14:23.569 --> 14:27.771
Finish the Helix!
Rewrite my life code!

14:27.806 --> 14:31.208
It would help if you'd stop
smashing everything in sight.

14:31.243 --> 14:35.044
Bringing me along was
pretty smart...for you.

14:35.113 --> 14:39.415
Aside from Azmuth, himseli, I am the only
Galvan with sufficient intelligence to ...

14:39.484 --> 14:43.753
If you mention how smart
you are once more, I will end you.

14:43.788 --> 14:47.022
Got to say I'm
with you on that one.

14:47.058 --> 14:50.793
Do not interfere!
This upgrade is my right!

14:50.861 --> 14:55.965
But Azmuth says ...

14:56.034 --> 15:00.337
Azmuth says lots of
things, but where is he now?

15:00.405 --> 15:04.808
Right outside, trying to save
the Mechamorphs that you ...

15:05.844 --> 15:10.881
Of course he is!
They are his perfect creations!

15:10.950 --> 15:15.152
They deserve to be destroyed!

15:15.187 --> 15:19.589
I think you got that backwards, man!

15:19.625 --> 15:21.959
Pathetic.

15:21.994 --> 15:25.428
I'm just warming up.
Get it?

15:25.464 --> 15:31.801
Heatblast?
Warm?

15:31.836 --> 15:35.539
Keep away from my grandson!

15:43.949 --> 15:47.518
Stop fiddling with that thing.
We're getting out! Now!

15:47.553 --> 15:50.188
It's too late.
If I don't complete the link

15:50.223 --> 15:53.458
with the primary Helix, the
secondary Helix will cycle out

15:53.493 --> 15:57.194
of control and destroy
the moon with us on it.

16:06.338 --> 16:11.275
Even Azmuth couldn't have solved
that ... not under these conditions.

16:11.343 --> 16:13.911
At last, I will be cured!

16:24.021 --> 16:26.557
Yes!
It's working!

16:26.592 --> 16:30.294
I can feel my life code changing!

16:30.329 --> 16:33.463
Uh, am I crazy, or did he just win?

16:33.498 --> 16:35.365
Wait for it.

16:47.944 --> 16:50.478
We rule!
We totally rule!

16:50.514 --> 16:52.047
We got lucky.

16:52.082 --> 16:55.650
What luck?
Me plus Omnitrix times crazy

16:55.686 --> 16:58.286
supervillain equals total
smack down!

16:59.556 --> 17:02.590
Actually, I was the one who
defeated him.

17:02.659 --> 17:06.094
By managing the power cycles of
the two Helixes, I caused an

17:06.130 --> 17:09.396
overload just as the Mechamorph
touched the control rods.

17:09.465 --> 17:12.767
Top that, Omnitrix boy.

17:12.801 --> 17:15.036
You're really getting on
my nerves, guy.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.512
Upgrade complete.

17:29.142 --> 17:33.246
I am complete!

17:33.314 --> 17:34.780
You have what you wanted.

17:34.849 --> 17:37.317
Now you're like the
rest of the Mechamorphs.

17:40.489 --> 17:44.924
What I am now
is so much more than they!

17:44.960 --> 17:47.126
I am superior!

17:47.162 --> 17:50.497
Oh, boy.
Evil speech of evil time.

17:50.565 --> 17:53.400
Evil? No.

17:53.435 --> 17:54.801
Visionary!

17:54.870 --> 17:57.570
I feel power building inside me!

17:57.606 --> 18:01.074
I see the world that only I can
create!

18:01.143 --> 18:04.144
It was Azmuth who thought me
flawed.

18:04.213 --> 18:08.982
He gave me the name Malware.

18:09.018 --> 18:11.251
But I am not the flawed one.

18:11.287 --> 18:13.854
It is all the rest that are inferior.

18:13.889 --> 18:17.124
They bend and stretch, mimic and

18:17.159 --> 18:20.761
manipulate only what other have
created.

18:20.796 --> 18:23.798
I do not upgrade others' creations.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.133
They upgrade me!

18:26.169 --> 18:31.973
And I will upgrade myself with
Azmuth's greatest creation.

18:32.008 --> 18:34.643
Dude, I can't
even begin to tell you

18:34.644 --> 18:37.278
how much none of that is gonna happen.

18:43.452 --> 18:47.188
Accept the inevitable.

18:56.498 --> 18:57.465
Ohh!

18:57.500 --> 19:00.968
Ben, break off! This
whole place is gonna come down!

19:01.004 --> 19:02.537
Don't worry.

19:02.572 --> 19:04.338
I have a plan.
I can do this.

19:04.374 --> 19:07.408
Can he?
- He always surprises me.

19:21.224 --> 19:23.792
Why do you struggle?

19:23.861 --> 19:28.864
In a moment, I will access all the
codes, and the device will be mine.

19:28.899 --> 19:30.198
You know how many

19:30.234 --> 19:34.403
guys have said that to me?
All of them!

19:36.974 --> 19:40.342
Guess who's still got it!

19:40.411 --> 19:43.779
I've had enough!

19:43.847 --> 19:46.782
Ha!
Now it's mine!

19:50.987 --> 19:54.623
Don't you ever get tired of being wrong?

20:06.670 --> 20:10.372
Give up, Malware! Only one of
us is walking away from this!

20:10.441 --> 20:12.742
You are right about that!

20:12.810 --> 20:14.844
Oh, man.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.083
Say goodbye, little human.

20:20.118 --> 20:23.219
You can't get through crystal, can you?

20:23.288 --> 20:25.855
Too bad, so sad.

20:25.924 --> 20:29.926
No!
Stop! You can't!

20:32.230 --> 20:36.566
You haven't won.
I will be free again.

20:36.635 --> 20:43.139
And when I am, all the Galvan
system ... all of the universe ...

20:44.742 --> 20:48.777
Will thank me for
shutting you up.

20:48.846 --> 20:51.313
Good work, son.
Top-notch.

20:51.382 --> 20:54.850
Told you my plan would work.
My plans always work.

20:54.885 --> 20:57.052
It's always the same plan.

20:57.121 --> 21:00.689
Hey, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.

21:03.226 --> 21:09.232
Goodbye, Tennysons. Thank you
for not destroying everything.

21:09.301 --> 21:12.769
<i>I totally just saved two
whole planets by myself.</i>

21:12.804 --> 21:15.772
<i>- One planet and a moon.
- Details.</i>

21:15.841 --> 21:20.410
<i>So? I totally helped Azmuth
save all those other Mechamorphs.</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:23.780
<i>Grandpa, can we leave
Gwen behind again?</i>

21:25.883 --> 21:30.419
Hmm.
This has been... illuminating.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.390
Copy Helix files.
Copy all files.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.393
Designate... Ben Tennyson.

21:37.428 --> 21:39.862
<i>I am so done being your lab rat!</i>

21:39.898 --> 21:42.865
<i>Blukic is the one who crossed
the polarities!</i>

21:42.900 --> 21:45.668
<i>You set his pants on fire.
Liar, liar.</i>

21:46.637 --> 21:49.972
Seriously, you guys are
worse than Azmuth.

21:50.041 --> 21:54.443
<i>- Of course we are. Everyone is.
- That Galvan's a genius!</i>

21:56.213 --> 21:59.415
We have everything we need
now, boy.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.684
No secrets are safe.
