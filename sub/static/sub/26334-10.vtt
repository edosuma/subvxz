Not again.

Hey, Ronnie? It's Carl.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.419
Damn thing
broke down again.

00:28.463 --> 00:31.509
I thought you said
they fixed this thing.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.524
Hey, hey, truck.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.048
Yo, just
grab and go.

All I'm seeing are a bunch of
people stealing from a truck.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.071
That was left on a certain
block at a certain time

01:11.114 --> 01:13.334
for a certain reason.GORMLEY: If you
want to catch

01:13.377 --> 01:15.292
a fish, you got
to bait a hook.That kind of down-home

01:15.336 --> 01:16.946
wisdom isn't how it's playing.

GARRETT:
I would love nothing more,

01:20.384 --> 01:21.951
but that's how
it's being taken.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.996
All across the spectrum.GORMLEY: Well, I'm
not buying that.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.781
Well, I'm not selling it.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.218
GORMLEY: How many people
you think, all added up,

01:28.262 --> 01:29.828
have watched Cops
at some point?

01:29.872 --> 01:32.004
Watched which cops? Cops,the TV show.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.267
:
I don't know.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.964
Millions, tens of millions.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.313
And they'll look at that
and they'll say,

01:36.357 --> 01:38.837
"Smart, that is
smart police work there.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.143
Good for the NYPD."

01:40.187 --> 01:41.927
Well, your Copsfans
don't seem to have

01:41.971 --> 01:43.451
the news outlets
or op-ed pages.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.844
GORMLEY: And merely affording
a person and opportunity

01:45.888 --> 01:50.022
to commit a crime does
not make it entrapment.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.503
But steering people
toward one does.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.983
You see the logo
on that truck?

01:54.026 --> 01:56.812
And the driver acting
like it broke down...
Enough.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.559
First of all, you're not
actually saying that

02:04.602 --> 02:07.736
the people stealing shoes
are the victims here?

02:07.779 --> 02:09.999
It's not me saying.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.305
This is being
widely condemned

02:11.348 --> 02:13.524
as a violation
of community trust.

02:14.569 --> 02:18.355
Second... who was in charge?

02:18.399 --> 02:21.010
The supervisor was Jon Harvey,

02:21.053 --> 02:23.534
he's a Special Operations
Lieutenant out of the 2-1.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.276
Bring him in.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.017
You want me to release
a statement that he's

02:28.060 --> 02:29.845
under review?No. We're not doing anything

02:29.888 --> 02:31.238
till we have context.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.500
What do you mean?

02:32.543 --> 02:34.589
That footage came from
our cameras,

02:34.632 --> 02:37.505
which means one of our own
leaked it,

02:37.548 --> 02:40.247
which means the kids
lifting sneakers

02:40.290 --> 02:43.337
aren't the only ones
who got snookered.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.382
We did.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.342
Hey, you got
a minute, Sarge?

02:48.385 --> 02:49.517
Hey, how's it going, Tony?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.345
Not good; they just
told me you got me

02:51.388 --> 02:53.999
working a set of
midnights next week.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.175
Just the one set, yeah.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.741
Bradley's out DIF.
So I need you to cover.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.526
Can't someone else do
it? I did last week.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.441
You're up.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.443
Why do I feel like you're
giving me special treatment

03:02.486 --> 03:04.619
and not the good kind?

03:04.662 --> 03:06.838
No one's getting special
treatment; good or bad.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.232
Okay, great, then I want
next Friday off.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.538
Why?
Because I want

03:10.581 --> 03:12.017
to take my son
to the Rangers game.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.410
I'm sorry, I can't give
you that one.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.629
But you gave it to
Bradley and Chris, so...?

03:14.672 --> 03:16.326
Which is why I can't
give it to you;

03:16.370 --> 03:17.632
we're down at minimum
manning numbers here.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.634
No special treatment, huh?

03:21.157 --> 03:22.506
Whatever you say, Sarge.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.299
What do we got?

03:32.342 --> 03:34.518
No weapon, no witnesses,
no video.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
We got next to nothing so far.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.826
Not even a name?Charlotte Huntington.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.307
Management says she's been
renting here the past two years.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.265
Hmm.
No one saw or
heard anything?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.962
Not till the neighbor
found her this morning.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.616
Great.
Whoa.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.140
Charlotte sure did seem
to love her hip-hop.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.404
White girl in her 30's;
wouldn't peg her as the type.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.840
Hey, look at that;
she's even got

03:51.883 --> 03:54.321
an autographed copy
of Playa Boy Shine's album.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.844
Wouldn't peg you
as the type, either.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.281
Look at all these covers
of Tone Beastmagazine.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.849
Remind me again how you know
about all this?

04:00.892 --> 04:03.373
Two teenage boys, they've
schooled me on everything rap.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.375
Including the headaches
in the car,

04:05.419 --> 04:06.985
you know, from playing
the music so loud.

04:07.029 --> 04:09.292
Seems Charlotte has some,
uh, credibility

04:09.336 --> 04:10.728
in the hip-hop community.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.643
She's got her own
Wikipedia page.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.515
She seems to have
an in with all the, uh,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.256
major players
in the hip-hop scene, too.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.301
Maybe she wrote a piece
about one of them,

04:18.345 --> 04:20.651
they didn't like it and...
bada-boom.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.132
But I thought all these rappers
were all talk.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.655
Well, a lot of them are.

04:24.699 --> 04:27.789
But some of them are real,
like, uh, this guy right here.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.443
Cameron Gooding. He's real.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.966
That his real name
or his rap name?

04:31.009 --> 04:33.403
That's his real name.
His rap name is Thin Majesty,

04:33.447 --> 04:35.013
but he changed it back
to Cameron Gooding

04:35.057 --> 04:36.754
when he got rich enough
to be respectable.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.234
Huh. You like him?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.975
I love him! He's good.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.586
He's got great rhymes;
he's got swag.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.109
I meant do you like him
for the murder?

04:44.153 --> 04:46.416
Oh, well,
I don't know about that.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.549
But this'll be a good excuse
to meet him.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.117
Officer Bradley.Here.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.163
Officer Janko.Present.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.686
Officer Thomas.Here.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.168
Officer Wallace.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.300
Something funny?

05:01.736 --> 05:03.085
JANKO:
Sarge.

05:03.128 --> 05:03.912
Your shield.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.217
It's upside-down, sir.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.525
Uh-huh.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.222
Oh, come on, Sarge,
you're styling.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.920
That's very funny. Thank you.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.139
Everyone, let's get to work.
Fall out.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.577
Hey, I'll meet
up with you.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.537
So, that's the second prank
in as many weeks.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.234
Y-You got to give him a rip.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.497
I have no proof
it was him.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.889
But you know it was.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.804
He needs to learn
some respect.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.373
I will earn everyone's
respect in due time

05:30.417 --> 05:32.157
and in my own way.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.769
How? By letting Tuna
walk all over you?

05:34.812 --> 05:36.901
No, by leading
by example.

05:36.945 --> 05:40.383
Jamie, you've got
to be the boss here.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.993
I am the boss.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.212
And right now,
you're late

05:43.255 --> 05:45.519
for your patrol
post, Officer Janko.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.179
And your Honor, in conclusion,

05:54.223 --> 05:56.878
we're only here
because of an illegal stop.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.401
Based on the total fabrication

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
that my client's
taillight was out.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.405
Since the predicate for
the stop was illegal,

06:02.449 --> 06:04.320
this court must suppress
the guns the police recovered

06:04.364 --> 06:05.713
from my client's car.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.238
Good luck with that.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.457
Don't count your chickens.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.850
The last two cases
we had on Russell Heatly,

06:12.894 --> 06:15.418
he walked after
a suppression hearing.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.203
ADA Richardson, does
the prosecution have a response?

06:20.249 --> 06:22.425
I sure wish that was you
up there instead of Richardson.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.513
He's ready.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.341
He's nervous;
look at him.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.256
I was, too, for my
first big case.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.431
RICHARDSON:
Your Honor,

06:28.475 --> 06:29.693
as you saw earlier in the video

06:29.737 --> 06:31.434
from the building's
surveillance camera,

06:31.478 --> 06:34.481
I do not believe
it definitively shows

06:34.524 --> 06:36.308
Mr. Heatly's
taillight was out.

06:36.352 --> 06:39.311
That sounds like you agree
with the defense.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.878
The video was blurry,

06:40.922 --> 06:43.359
Your Honor.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.621
The defense's argument
is inconclusive.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.276
JUDGE: Anyone you wish
to call to the stand?

06:47.319 --> 06:49.452
Perhaps the officers
who pulled Mr. Heatly over?

06:49.496 --> 06:52.455
No. Your Honor.

06:52.499 --> 06:55.371
Do you have the officers
in the courtroom?

06:56.720 --> 06:58.113
No, your Honor, I do not.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.905
An illegal search?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.211
What the hell
happened, Martin?

07:09.254 --> 07:10.604
Ask the judge.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.909
Can't believe she let him
out of jail.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.389
Well, I can;
you didn't even call

07:13.433 --> 07:15.217
the police officers
as witnesses.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.871
I shouldn't have needed to.We went over this.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.786
We couldn't afford
any risks with this guy.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.006
I gave it my best shot, Erin.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.008
Did you?
Yes. You got a beef?

07:24.052 --> 07:25.445
Tell it to the judge.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.589
♪

07:59.783 --> 08:00.828
♪

08:00.871 --> 08:02.133
So I should just
keep my mouth shut,

08:02.177 --> 08:04.179
is that what
you're saying?I didn't say that.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.963
But feel free to keep
your mouth shut.I just want straight questions

08:06.007 --> 08:06.964
and straight answers,

08:07.008 --> 08:08.183
not slanted questions

08:20.195 --> 08:21.544
Lieutenant Harvey.Commissioner Moore.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.938
Lieutenant Gormley.Sit down, Lieutenant.

08:27.594 --> 08:31.554
Hear you got reporters for
garden gnomes since yesterday.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.600
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say
there ought to be a law,

08:33.643 --> 08:36.385
but I checked.
The law's in their favor.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.824
This whole thing has been
blown out of proportion.

08:40.868 --> 08:41.956
In your opinion.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.435
HARVEY:
Yes.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.176
In my opinion.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.571
You're not the only one.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.747
Why do you think
that, Lieutenant?

08:50.791 --> 08:53.489
This was a specifically
targeted operation

08:53.533 --> 08:55.491
to lure gang members
out of hiding.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.449
We've got a number
of warehouse blocks in the 2-1,

08:57.493 --> 08:58.842
and we've had a growing problem
with break-ins

08:58.886 --> 09:00.148
and hijacked
shipments.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.367
So it wasn't entrapment,

09:02.411 --> 09:05.109
just a sitting duck
you could control and harvest.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.502
Yes, sir.
And with those controls,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.460
with the video records,
we were able to identify

09:08.504 --> 09:11.594
and arrest several high-level
members of the Ace Double Treys.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.857
What about the other civilians
arrested at the scene?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.293
HARVEY: Anyone without
an outstanding warrant

09:15.337 --> 09:17.208
was issued a desk
appearance ticket

09:17.252 --> 09:18.514
and released.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.560
Sure, they were inconvenienced,

09:20.603 --> 09:22.953
but it's not like they had
the purest intentions, either.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.608
No, they did not.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.089
HARVEY: I'm sorry
for the fallout, sir.

09:28.132 --> 09:32.528
But my tactics were effective,
and the results were valuable.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.312
And that's all that matters.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.575
Not allthat matters.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.620
It is also not the least
of the problems

09:37.664 --> 09:39.970
that comes from this operation.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.451
Sir?

09:42.494 --> 09:46.455
Why do you think the footage
was leaked, Lieutenant?

09:46.498 --> 09:49.501
I've been asking myself that.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.721
Well, I'masking you.

09:51.765 --> 09:55.595
Straight up? I don't know.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.336
Someone got a beef with you?

09:58.380 --> 09:59.860
No, not that I know of.

09:59.903 --> 10:03.167
Well, I'm gonna find out.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.606
You sure you don't want
to save me some time?

10:08.651 --> 10:11.001
If I had a name,
I'd give it to you.

10:13.961 --> 10:17.704
Okay. Thank you. That's all.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.749
Thank you.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.195
It was a harmless prank, Eddie,

10:31.239 --> 10:33.633
and it was kind of funny.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.505
Maybe the first time.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.943
But he's been coming after
Sergeant Reagan since day one.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.815
Then let Sarge deal with it.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.686
I guess.
Look,

10:43.730 --> 10:44.818
Look, I know you guys
used to be partners,

10:44.861 --> 10:46.646
but he's the boss now.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.778
Maybe he has had
some of this coming.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.388
How so?

10:50.432 --> 10:52.216
Come on.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.306
Nah, stripes are
something you sew on.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.004
Respect is something you earn.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.658
Puts the stripes first,
if you ask me.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
I thought you came
around on him.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.966
I did, just not
all the way around.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.406
We've been through all this.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.538
There's nothing
that's gonna get us

11:09.581 --> 11:11.279
more evidence against Heatly.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.410
Yeah, but maybe
we missed something,

11:12.454 --> 11:14.325
a technicality or...No, Erin.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.588
That traffic stop
was our lucky break,

11:16.632 --> 11:17.589
and we lost it.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.679
You never should
have given this

11:19.722 --> 11:21.506
to someone as green
as Richardson.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.508
The way he handled it
didn't make any sense.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.162
There's got to be more to this.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.862
Every time you make a mistake,
there's got to be more to it.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.515
Can you just stay?
Humor me.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.086
You wanted to see me?

11:36.130 --> 11:38.698
Yes. Come on in
and close the door.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.963
You're a good lawyer, Martin.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.747
I've been watching you
for the past few months.

11:44.791 --> 11:48.533
You're diligent, thorough,
uncompromising.
Thank you.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.187
Which makes me wonder
how you conducted

11:50.231 --> 11:52.668
the most ineffective suppression
hearing I've ever seen.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.888
I already told you,
the judge...

11:54.931 --> 11:56.716
Tell me something true.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.457
Heatly got to you,
didn't he?

12:02.634 --> 12:04.636
No, he didn't.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.813
Don't lie to me.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.729
He got to my mom and sister.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.687
Sent some of his goons
to threaten them.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.388
So you tanked it for him.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.347
No. I got them out of town.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.088
Look, did it rattle me?

12:21.131 --> 12:22.698
Maybe. Did I tank?
Hell no.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.091
I did my job, Erin.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.745
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got some work to do.

12:31.228 --> 12:34.754
You know, my old man
went from being

12:34.797 --> 12:37.669
an apprentice framer to having
his own contracting company.

12:37.713 --> 12:38.627
You know what he always said?

12:38.670 --> 12:41.064
No, I don't, Anthony.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.676
"You're not really a boss
until you've fired someone."

12:52.249 --> 12:53.903
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.687
We need to speak
with Cameron Gooding.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.733
Is this about
Charlotte Huntington?

12:59.691 --> 13:04.131
Marty, uh, these detectives
are here to talk to Mr. Gooding.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.829
Oh. Marty Ellis.
Cam's partner.

13:06.873 --> 13:07.917
I'm afraid I know
what this is about.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.223
Mm.
We loved her.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.007
We adored her.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
Such a tragedy.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.750
Charlotte, you're talking about?Yeah.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.012
Loved her.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.622
We want to talk to
your partner about her.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.450
He's pretty broken up.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.452
Well, we're just gathering
information here.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.846
Honestly, it's nothing
to be worked up about.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.848
Okay. Follow me.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.595
Nice to meet you.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.819
You know, I'm a big fan
of yours, by the way.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.385
I don't think I've ever
heard a cop say that before.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.996
Well, I got cool kids.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.694
What can you tell us about the
murder of Charlotte Huntington?

13:45.737 --> 13:47.565
Sad.

13:47.609 --> 13:48.653
That's it?

13:48.697 --> 13:50.612
That's it.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.832
The last few stories she wrote
about you were pretty harsh.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.791
Well, she still had access.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.836
That should tell you a lot.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.837
BAEZ:
All it tells us

13:57.880 --> 13:58.838
is that you're still trying

13:58.881 --> 13:59.708
to seem relevant,

13:59.751 --> 14:00.883
like you're worth the ink.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.711
GOODING:
So your theory is that

14:02.754 --> 14:05.583
I killed her over a little
disrespect in a rag?

14:05.627 --> 14:07.237
You know,
not for nothing, but, uh,

14:07.281 --> 14:10.153
people have been killed
over stupid beefs

14:10.197 --> 14:12.068
in the rap game before,
just saying.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.549
No matter how high you climb,

14:14.592 --> 14:16.072
they still come around here
harassing you.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.161
They got their
little job to do.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.554
DANNY: Yeah, 'cause
the murder of a woman

14:19.597 --> 14:22.774
is a littlething now, right?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.516
You got nothing on me.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.953
Did you know that Charlotte
was writing a book

14:26.996 --> 14:29.390
about the rise of
Dead Dove Records?

14:31.044 --> 14:34.308
Mm-hmm. I knew.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
And she received
a very sizable advance,

14:36.440 --> 14:39.530
which means she was probably
promising the goods.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.837
And we were fully cooperating.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.927
Look, she was hard on
a hundred other artists.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.276
Why don't you go
waste their time?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.799
We plan on it, after we find out

14:47.843 --> 14:49.540
where you were two nights ago,

14:49.584 --> 14:51.803
starting at around,
I don't know, 7:00 p.m.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.718
In the studio, as usual.

14:53.762 --> 14:54.806
Do you have proof?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.808
You got a warrant?

14:56.852 --> 14:59.899
'Cause if not,
this conversation is over.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.955
Is there a problem?

15:12.999 --> 15:15.784
A problem? You know
damn well there's a problem.

15:15.827 --> 15:19.092
My cuffs, they were
double-locked.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.268
I collared a perp today,
and he almost got away

15:21.311 --> 15:22.399
because I couldn't cuff him.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.487
Someone double

15:23.531 --> 15:24.967
Don't play dumb with me, Sarge.

15:25.011 --> 15:25.968
Watch your tone, Tuna.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.230
You're lucky I'm no snitch,

15:27.274 --> 15:29.841
or I'd report you to IAB.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.720
Officer Janko,
may I have a word with you?

15:40.548 --> 15:43.333
He had it coming.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.467
He's been disrespecting you
since you got here.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.512
And that's gonna help?It might.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.645
It won't.
It'll just escalate the chaos,

15:50.688 --> 15:52.125
not to mention
undermine my authority.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.909
I was just trying
to have your back.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.258
Having my back doesn't mean
going tit for tat

15:55.302 --> 15:56.868
with a bully
in a prank war, Eddie.

15:56.912 --> 16:01.003
Okay. Jamie, this is not
that big of a deal.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.657
It-it is.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.093
Another officer could've been
put in danger.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.966
You know I would never
do anything to hurt someone.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.971
I know, but I got
to give you a rip.

16:16.366 --> 16:19.761
The suspect then entered the
Danby's Donuts on 49th Street.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.806
The officers followed him in.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.244
He was apprehended
without incident.

16:24.287 --> 16:28.770
Well, except for the damage to
the supply of chocolate glazed.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.032
Lieutenant, what about

16:30.076 --> 16:31.860
the entrapment
in the 2

16:31.903 --> 16:33.862
If you're referring
to the operation...

16:33.905 --> 16:36.212
Okay, "sting."

16:36.256 --> 16:37.997
It netted a number
of violent offenders

16:38.040 --> 16:40.216
with outstanding warrants
against them.As well as

16:40.260 --> 16:42.827
a dozen citizens
with no record at all.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.221
Surely you know that
the community is up in arms.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.962
Surely some of the community
are grateful

16:47.006 --> 16:48.833
for the proactive police work.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.401
Has any disciplinary action been
taken toward Lieutenant Harvey

16:51.445 --> 16:53.360
and the officers
under his command?

16:53.403 --> 16:54.970
No. Now, if there's...

16:55.014 --> 16:57.842
Is the NYPD doing anything
to deal with Harvey's actions?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.627
How about you guys get
the full story

16:59.670 --> 17:00.932
before you hang him out to dry?

17:00.976 --> 17:02.760
You don't think Harvey
crossed a line?

17:02.804 --> 17:05.241
It was an operation to address
a specific condition

17:05.285 --> 17:07.939
perpetrated by gang members
in the area.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.551
So everyone arrested
on that video was a gang member?

17:10.594 --> 17:12.988
No.MAN:
Then the NYPD

17:13.032 --> 17:14.381
is condoning entrapment.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.122
It wasn't entrapment.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.819
It was a sting.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.952
A beautiful sting that
some lowlifes walked into!

17:20.996 --> 17:22.476
End of story!

17:31.659 --> 17:33.574
It wasn't entrapment.
It was a sting.

17:33.617 --> 17:37.534
A beautiful sting
that some lowlifes walked into!

17:37.578 --> 17:39.493
End of story!

17:49.329 --> 17:51.113
Little piece of advice.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.462
No, thanks.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
When you yell
"end of story"

17:54.290 --> 17:56.118
at a group of reporters,
you're telling them

17:56.162 --> 17:58.642
right then and there
that there's more to the story.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.776
What the hell were you thinking?

18:01.819 --> 18:04.126
That I was speaking for the NYPD

18:04.170 --> 18:06.563
and defending Lieutenant Harvey.Your briefings

18:06.607 --> 18:09.784
are the Metro section,
not the op-ed page.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.002
Who's gonna speak for him?

18:11.046 --> 18:12.221
No one has to.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.701
What do you think this is,
the U.N.?

18:13.744 --> 18:15.442
The guy's got reporters
all over his front yard.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.226
I can't care.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.838
This is an internal affair.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.102
We keep our own counsel,
we speak as one,

18:23.145 --> 18:26.496
and only after we'vedecided
where we landed.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.368
You got that, Lieutenant?

18:28.411 --> 18:31.458
Loud and clear. We let
Harvey swing in the wind.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.722
Watch it, Sid.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.463
Easy.I thought I was

18:36.506 --> 18:38.117
just telling the truth.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.119
Truth is, Harvey
should've weighed his actions

18:40.162 --> 18:41.598
not just against
his CompStat grades

18:41.642 --> 18:44.123
but against the image

18:44.166 --> 18:46.168
of this department as a whole.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.387
What?

18:47.430 --> 18:48.953
TARU just got back to us.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.868
The proprietary
footage was leaked

18:50.912 --> 18:52.827
by a Detective
Justin Powl.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.308
He went to some lengths to
try and remain anonymous.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.138
♪

19:07.320 --> 19:09.844
Thank you in advance.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.413
For being a traitor?No.

19:13.456 --> 19:16.155
For helping with a
police investigation.

19:16.198 --> 19:20.420
You seemed pretty certain I'd
come down here immediately. Why?

19:20.463 --> 19:22.987
Charlotte spent a lot
of time at the studio.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.250
For her book?

19:24.293 --> 19:25.555
Partly.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.818
Was there something
else going on?

19:32.127 --> 19:34.216
They were sleeping together.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.392
I'd book their
hotels and taxis.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.960
It was my job to
keep it discreet.

19:39.003 --> 19:42.181
So what happened,
they have a fight, break up?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.747
Not exactly.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.750
Well, why was she writing
these hit pieces in magazines

19:46.794 --> 19:49.753
and contracted to write a book
to take him down?

19:49.797 --> 19:51.668
He didn't know
about the book.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.236
So he knew
about the hit pieces?

19:54.280 --> 19:56.847
Well, he helped her write
the magazine pieces.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.894
They were designed to
make him look hard.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.591
He was worried
that people thought

20:01.635 --> 20:05.073
all the money had made him look
soft, like he'd lost his cred.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.293
Okay, I'm a little bit confused

20:07.336 --> 20:09.599
as to why you
asked me down here.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.385
She started
talking to me...

20:12.428 --> 20:15.039
without him controlling
the conversation.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.302
About?

20:16.345 --> 20:19.130
About stuff he wouldn't
want in a book.

20:19.174 --> 20:23.570
About checks delivered to
young women in other cities.

20:23.613 --> 20:28.270
About the NDAs he made even
the liquor delivery guy sign.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.924
About stuff I knew.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.405
Did he know she was talking
to you about this stuff?

20:32.448 --> 20:34.624
I don't know for sure.

20:34.668 --> 20:38.237
But he probably suspected she
wasn't just taking dictation?

20:39.673 --> 20:44.068
Those office walls aren't
soundproofed like the studio's.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.462
You could hear
them fighting.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.300
It's very festive, Pop.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.780
Yeah, thanks.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.435
But I don't deserve all
the credit; Nicky helped.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.479
Oh, really?

21:03.523 --> 21:05.264
NICKY: Class was
cancelled on Friday,

21:05.307 --> 21:07.178
so I came over and we
spent the day together.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.615
Yeah.ERIN: That's funny.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.965
I still couldn't get
a return phone call.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.314
NICKY:
I was revisiting

21:12.358 --> 21:14.360
my childhood.
It didn't have a cell phone.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.278
But a tad early for decorations,
don't you think?

21:19.321 --> 21:20.757
HENRY:
Nah.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.455
Never too early for Christmas.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.631
To quote the guys
who own the big-box stores.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.807
Nah, I just tune all that
stuff out. I'm with Pop.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.112
How do you tune it out?

21:28.156 --> 21:29.853
The malls start blasting
"Jingle Bells"

21:29.897 --> 21:31.551
literally the day
after Halloween.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.335
Who made you
the resident Grinch?

21:33.379 --> 21:34.510
Like father,
like son?

21:34.554 --> 21:36.338
What does that mean?Dad, you spoiled Santa

21:36.382 --> 21:38.514
for us way before Mom
wanted that one to happen.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.603
Well, it was time.
You needed to be...

21:40.647 --> 21:42.344
ERIN: He was the
same way as a kid,

21:42.388 --> 21:45.042
if it's any consolation.
He used to steal

21:45.086 --> 21:46.130
all the Christmas
presents.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.480
All right, I didn't
steal anything.

21:47.523 --> 21:48.916
Okay, hid them.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.310
I was preparing you
for a life of detective work.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.485
Oh, please.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.051
He did the
same to us.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.227
You spilled the beans about
Santa too early to us, too.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.881
I've never really
forgiven you for that.

21:57.925 --> 22:00.144
It was good.
You needed to grow up.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.537
I was five.

22:02.669 --> 22:03.931
I was five.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.237
Mom wasn't having any of it.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.414
She kept signing all the
gift tags "from Santa" anyway.

22:08.457 --> 22:09.458
Aw.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.981
Still probably
be doing it today.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.461
HENRY:
Yeah.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.159
Mm-hmm.
Who tried to tell you
there wasn't a Santa?

22:15.203 --> 22:17.466
Kids at school.
I ran with an older crowd.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.381
Oh.When you were how old?

22:19.425 --> 22:23.211
I was third grade and they
were fifth and sixth.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.344
But didn't your parents
still try to convince you?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.910
I guess so.

22:26.954 --> 22:30.000
When my dad was being sentenced
for fraud and embezzlement,

22:30.044 --> 22:32.525
he used to say, "Where do you
think all that stuff came from?

22:32.568 --> 22:34.396
Santa Claus?"

22:34.440 --> 22:35.528
Whoa, whoa.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.967
I didn't mean it
to come out like that,

22:40.010 --> 22:41.534
but I do
like Christmas,

22:41.577 --> 22:44.580
I just don't have
any personal experience

22:44.624 --> 22:47.496
with the whole happy family
Christmas memories.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.889
We'll have to
get you started.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.238
Yeah.

22:50.281 --> 22:51.500
But you can't force it.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.590
If you force it,
it won't do any good anyway.

22:54.634 --> 22:57.201
Isn't it just
stressful?

22:57.245 --> 22:59.421
It is for a lot of people.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.902
Well, then you just shift
your weight for those two weeks.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.817
You just emphasize your thanks

23:03.860 --> 23:06.907
for being part
of the family of man.

23:06.950 --> 23:11.738
Where my bar is set
is Christmas morning in 1914,

23:11.781 --> 23:15.394
when British and French soldiers
laid down their arms,

23:15.437 --> 23:16.960
climbed out of the trenches

23:17.004 --> 23:20.355
and spent the day playing soccer
with their German enemies.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.748
I heard that
was a myth.

23:21.791 --> 23:24.403
Well, nobody knows where
it began or how it spread,

23:24.446 --> 23:26.274
but it did happen, Jack.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.884
HENRY:
Over 100,000 men,

23:27.928 --> 23:30.539
up and down the Western Front.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.845
FRANK:
How old was I,

23:31.888 --> 23:33.499
when you first told me
about that?

23:33.542 --> 23:35.544
Just old enough
to understand it.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.373
So now, after every
Christmas dinner,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.637
we put down our weapons,
go out back, and play soccer.

23:43.944 --> 23:46.468
Little true.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.839
Think you're real
funny, don't you?

24:09.883 --> 24:11.101
Morning to you,
too, boss.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.581
Open it, now.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.235
Open what?
My locker.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.237
You clipped the lock
and replaced it, am I wrong?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.195
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.632
I'm not gonna ask you again.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.590
What are you gonna do,
count to ten?

24:21.634 --> 24:25.202
Okay. Then you're riding with me
until the pranks stop.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.987
Whoa! No, Sarge.
Hey, I'm serious.

24:27.030 --> 24:30.947
So am I. Suit up.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.038
The officers were surprised

24:35.082 --> 24:36.562
they were not notified
about the hearing.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.738
I told you, I thought
I presented enough evidence.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.697
You also told me that Heatly
threatened your family,

24:41.741 --> 24:44.047
clearly in an effort to get you
to tank the case

24:44.091 --> 24:45.614
against him,
and I believe

24:45.658 --> 24:47.311
you acted for that result.

24:50.619 --> 24:51.968
What are you saying?

24:52.012 --> 24:56.538
You've given me no choice
but to terminate you.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.322
I'm sorry.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.071
And the Bar Association?
You notifying them?

25:08.115 --> 25:09.377
That will be up to the DA.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.640
I'm not gonna make a scene.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.120
Your work here is done.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.342
Of course I have a permit.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.653
I can't believe
that he gave me a rip

25:24.697 --> 25:25.915
and let Tuna
off the hook.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.309
Well, Tuna's not
off the hook.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.267
Didn't you hear?
He's riding with Reagan.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.965
Better than
getting a rip.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.662
Uh, speak
for yourself.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.360
I'm speaking
from experience.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.538
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on him?

25:39.581 --> 25:42.410
So how long
has it been?

25:42.453 --> 25:43.585
How long has what been?

25:43.629 --> 25:46.196
You and him.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.894
How long have you been
sleeping together?

25:47.937 --> 25:50.592
You know, for a cop,
you make a lousy detective.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.246
Come on.

25:52.289 --> 25:55.118
I'll take that apology now.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.817
Okay, okay.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.470
DISPATCH:
Units in the confines

25:59.514 --> 26:01.429
of the 2-9 precinct,
we have a 10-30,

26:01.472 --> 26:02.822
robbery in progress
at the pawn shop

26:02.865 --> 26:05.694
located 295 East 19th Street.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.653
JAMIE :
Show 2-9 Sergeant responding.

26:07.696 --> 26:11.613
2-9 Charlie, show us
responding as well.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.148
TUNA: There they are.JAMIE: I see 'em.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.552
Go up the stairs.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.597
Take the side street,
cut them off.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.859
Are you sure?Yeah, just do it.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.208
All right.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.513
JAMIE:
Police! Stop!

26:59.705 --> 27:00.880
Come on!

27:04.666 --> 27:05.754
Gun!

27:10.106 --> 27:11.107
Get down.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.681
You okay?Yeah.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.337
Police! Drop your gun!

27:23.380 --> 27:24.555
Do it now!

27:28.429 --> 27:30.561
Jimmy, give me cover.Got it.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.539
JAMIE:
Come out! Get down!

27:51.582 --> 27:53.193
And drop the gun!
Drop it right now!

27:55.325 --> 27:57.414
Get down on the ground!

27:57.458 --> 27:59.721
Down on your face!

27:59.765 --> 28:00.853
Police. Don't move.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.161
Tuna, up front, the gun.Got it, got it.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.598
Don't move.

28:07.642 --> 28:08.991
You got any other
weapons on you?

28:09.035 --> 28:10.776
No.You all right?

28:10.819 --> 28:14.257
Yeah, man. But I think I need to
put in for a new pair of pants.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.824
I'll see what I can do.

28:15.868 --> 28:19.480
Hey, Sarge, that was
some good shooting.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.787
Nice work.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.571
Thanks.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.007
Come on, on your feet.

28:25.051 --> 28:28.010
Come on.
Let's go.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.233
Sergeant Reagan?
You okay?

28:33.276 --> 28:34.451
We're all right.
We're all right.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.583
We heard gunshots.Hey, sit him in an RMP.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.280
He's waiting on a bus.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.542
Yes, Sergeant.

28:38.586 --> 28:39.761
I got one
here for you...

28:39.805 --> 28:41.023
That bad, huh?

28:41.067 --> 28:42.546
I'm okay.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.552
JAMIE: We got shots fired.
We got two under, one wounded.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.946
So nobody gets in
here, all right?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.253
GORMLEY: Top tenth
in your class at the academy.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.037
Awarded the Combat Cross

28:55.081 --> 28:57.779
before you joined the Technical
Assistance Response Unit.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.650
High marks from
your boss there.

28:59.694 --> 29:02.175
So what made you
blow yourself up?

29:02.218 --> 29:06.570
I think Lieutenant Harvey's
a good cop.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.964
But some of his tactics
go directly against

29:09.008 --> 29:11.793
any understanding
of community policing.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.666
Except that he's effective.

29:16.711 --> 29:17.973
I go fishing

29:18.017 --> 29:20.759
and I drop a depth charge
in the lake.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.804
I'm gonna haul a lot of bass.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.154
Is that good fishing?

29:26.199 --> 29:27.809
And you know this how?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.680
You don't work out of his house.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.726
I live in the 2-1.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.946
My kids go to school
in the 2-1.

29:33.989 --> 29:36.862
My wife works
at a dental practice there.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.430
There is a very clear pipeline

29:40.474 --> 29:42.781
for bringing complaints
to this office,

29:42.824 --> 29:45.740
from the community
and from our officers.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.828
Not for me.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.177
What makes you so special?

29:50.179 --> 29:53.052
Lieutenant Harvey's
my brother-in-law.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.097
Okay.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.972
I-It's not a racial thing,
obviously.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.888
It's... it's a kids thing.

30:05.238 --> 30:08.458
Jon thinks, you're in your teens
or 20s in the 2-1,

30:08.502 --> 30:11.722
you're either a felon
or you're about to become one.

30:11.766 --> 30:16.858
So he goes fishing with
a depth charge and a big net.

30:16.902 --> 30:20.340
Keeps everyone scared
or suspicious of our cops.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.606
And you thought
this was the only way

30:25.649 --> 30:27.782
to bring it to our attention?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.567
I hoped it would be anonymous.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.267
Your new-school tactics,

30:34.310 --> 30:36.486
building trust,

30:36.530 --> 30:40.577
he puts a torch to it,
the way he operates sometimes.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.623
And you put a torch

30:42.666 --> 30:45.931
to the trust our cops have
to have with each other.

30:45.974 --> 30:49.935
Trust that is the bedrock
of the NYPD.

30:52.372 --> 30:55.941
You are suspended,
effective immediately.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.987
Lieutenant Gormley will take
your gun and shield.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.649
Cameron Gooding.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.653
Detectives.
You have a warrant?

31:12.696 --> 31:13.784
Nope, no warrant.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.656
Then you can go back
the way you came in.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.049
'Cause I got work to do.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.920
We know you were sleeping
with Charlotte Huntington.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.488
Doesn't mean anything.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.795
Well, does it mean anything
that she was betraying you?

31:24.839 --> 31:26.449
Wrong again.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.669
Now, why don't you get out of
here before I call my lawyers?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.976
Three past abuse allegations,
drug charges,

31:31.019 --> 31:33.239
illegal possession of firearms.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.893
What are you talking about?Well, those are some
of the highlights

31:34.936 --> 31:37.591
from the research Charlotte
was doing for her book.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.158
You know, the book
you said you knew about,

31:39.201 --> 31:40.463
but you really
didn't know about?

31:40.507 --> 31:42.726
Look, most of that stuff
is public record.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.033
No, it isn't. Not the
juicy stuff, anyway.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.861
That was all settled
out of court

31:46.905 --> 31:49.255
with big fat checks
and non-disclosure agreements.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.475
Let me see that file.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.696
Read it and weep.

31:58.568 --> 32:02.398
This-- this can't be real.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.052
Except it is.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.793
You guys made this up
to get to me or something.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.796
People close to Charlotte
verified the details.

32:08.839 --> 32:09.971
But she wouldn't do that.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.277
We were serious.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.497
I loved her, and she loved me.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.499
And she was using you.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.985
The whole time?

32:24.029 --> 32:26.509
The whole time.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.688
You did what you had to do.

32:31.732 --> 32:32.907
ERIN:
I know.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.126
Uh, it it what it is.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.301
I know.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.042
Heavy lies the head
that wears the crown.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.608
Okay, enough.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.350
You know Martin carries a gun?

32:41.394 --> 32:42.873
So? You do, too.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.136
He just didn't seem the type.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.572
Well, he just
doesn't seem the type

32:45.615 --> 32:48.053
to throw a case
for a gangster, either.

32:48.096 --> 32:51.056
You can't judge a book by
its cover. Live and learn.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.667
I'm gonna treat you to some
new clichés for Christmas.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.977
Yeah, Jake.

33:01.066 --> 33:05.722
W-We'll come down.
Keep an eye out.

33:05.766 --> 33:06.985
Come where where?

33:07.028 --> 33:09.378
I kept a guy sitting
on Heatly's block.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.685
There's another guy sitting
on Heatly's block

33:11.728 --> 33:14.949
in a Honda with plates
registered to Martin Richardson.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.561
Who carries a gun.

33:30.138 --> 33:32.140
♪

33:44.631 --> 33:45.980
What are you doing here?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.199
Right back at you, buddy.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.374
I need to talk to him.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.767
Hey! I got a permit for that.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.682
You'll get it back
when you calm down.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.207
I lost my job,
I lost my career 'cause of him.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.338
You want to lose your life
'cause of him?

33:56.382 --> 33:57.861
I was just gonna talk to him.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.254
From behind a gun?

33:59.298 --> 34:00.342
If I had to.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.865
Those conversations
never end well.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.303
You got to think, Martin.
Try to remember.

34:04.346 --> 34:05.217
Remember what?

34:05.260 --> 34:06.609
Remember when you were smart.

34:06.653 --> 34:07.915
What that felt like.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.786
See if you can get
that feeling back.

34:15.531 --> 34:16.619
You lost?

34:16.663 --> 34:18.404
No.
You look lost.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.058
Nothing for you
to see here, pal!

34:20.101 --> 34:21.668
Keep moving.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.104
Calling my lawyer.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.932
This is harassment.
If nothing else is,

34:24.975 --> 34:27.630
this is harassment.

34:27.674 --> 34:31.199
I want you back in the car
and I want you to drive home.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.375
You've already caused
enough problems with this case.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.116
He owes me.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.292
You owe me.
Now get in your car and drive.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.516
Give me my weapon.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.258
Come by my office and get it.
Tomorrow.

35:10.412 --> 35:11.544
Gooding.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.980
Drink?

35:13.023 --> 35:14.590
Why do I get the feeling
I'm a couple behind already?

35:14.634 --> 35:16.679
Because you are.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.379
Hell of a week, huh?

35:20.422 --> 35:22.859
Yeah. You doing all right?

35:22.903 --> 35:25.427
Yeah. I feel good, actually.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.516
Strange those two detectives
came by.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.431
Not really.

35:29.475 --> 35:30.432
What do you mean?

35:30.476 --> 35:32.304
I mean, Charlotte and I

35:32.347 --> 35:34.001
did have
a complicated relationship.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.222
It's not like you'd hurt her.
Would you?

35:37.265 --> 35:38.614
Hypothetically?

35:38.658 --> 35:41.182
Of course.Suppose she was, um,

35:41.226 --> 35:43.793
using me.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.447
Taking advantage
of my attraction to her.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.449
I don't follow.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.277
Trying to expose my past,

35:49.321 --> 35:52.193
trying to bring down everything
that we've built, you and me.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.281
Then you'd hurt her?

35:53.325 --> 35:56.154
Maybe.

35:59.461 --> 36:02.072
You're my best friend, Marty.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.379
I'd do anything for you.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.426
You'd do anything for me?

36:07.469 --> 36:09.515
I would.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.518
I'd kill for you.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.912
I'd kill for you, too.
You know that.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.571
Did you?

36:23.877 --> 36:25.226
Kill her?

36:25.270 --> 36:26.662
I thought we were talking
figure of speech here.

36:27.924 --> 36:31.493
Are you that good
of a friend, Marty?

36:31.537 --> 36:34.801
Yeah, I am.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.546
Was I gonna let some twist
take down a lifetime's work?

36:40.589 --> 36:43.157
No. I took care
of business.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.551
Our business.

36:49.990 --> 36:53.559
Yeah. You're a good friend.

♪

37:02.742 --> 37:05.527
Thank you.

37:05.571 --> 37:06.485
Bring it in.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.620
Did I ask you to do that?
I did not!

37:11.664 --> 37:13.492
All right! That's enough.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.797
You always have to ask!Hey!

37:14.841 --> 37:16.582
Back it up.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.502
Get what you need?

37:23.545 --> 37:24.503
Yeah, we got what we need.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.853
Good. At least somebody did.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.072
Get him on his feet.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.514
TUNA: And then Reagan goes,
"Cover me,"

37:35.557 --> 37:37.429
and then he jumps
behind a dumpster,

37:37.472 --> 37:39.518
then behind a car and
then he shoots a guy

37:39.561 --> 37:41.259
in the shoulder like
we were in Bad Boys.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.305
I think that beer might be
going to your head, Tuna.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.176
Yeah, no, it definitely is.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.483
Hey. Cheers, Sarge.

Cheers.

Mm.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.276
I'll get us another round.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.277
I'll come with you.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.582
Thanks.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.193
So Tuna, where does
that nickname come from?

38:03.237 --> 38:06.719
Oh, I had a summer job at
the MTA when I was younger,

38:06.762 --> 38:09.983
and my boss was a real piece
of work, so right before I quit,

38:10.026 --> 38:13.291
I hid an order of tuna sushi
in his office.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.857
It stunk up the
place real bad.

38:14.901 --> 38:17.120
They didn't find it
for, like, a week.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.644
So you've always been
a prankster.

38:18.687 --> 38:19.819
Look, I know
you don't believe me,

38:19.862 --> 38:21.124
but I'm telling you the truth.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.561
It wasn't me doing
those pranks.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.084
Seriously, Tuna,
as long as they've stopped,

38:24.127 --> 38:26.129
all is forgiven. All right?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.921
Well, he came and went.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.966
Who?Richardson.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.359
To get his gun?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.143
Yeah.So that's it?

38:40.187 --> 38:42.232
And said good-bye and thanks.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.017
Said to you but not to me.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.802
Well, you fired him, I didn't.
What's he gonna thank you for?

38:46.846 --> 38:48.369
Right.But he did pay you

38:48.413 --> 38:50.153
what he owed you.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.416
Surveillance shots
from a traffic camera

38:51.459 --> 38:54.114
right before Heatly was stopped
by our cops.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.682
Time stamped and
crystal clear, showing

38:56.725 --> 38:58.640
that his left taillight was out.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.034
Richardson was sitting on this.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.862
Well, not anymore.
I had one

39:02.905 --> 39:04.994
of your ADAs notify the judge
and the defense attorneys.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.954
We're due in chambers
in 20 minutes.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.348
With a lot of explaining to do.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.262
That's why they pay you
the big, big bucks.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.274
Justin?

39:24.318 --> 39:27.277
:
Hey, Jonny.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.106
What brings you in here?

39:30.150 --> 39:32.065
Oh. I'm supposed to meet the PC.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.023
Me, too.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.070
You, uh, you got
the day off?

39:39.028 --> 39:41.379
I got suspended.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.470
It was you.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.908
Leaked the footage?

39:48.951 --> 39:50.475
Yeah.

39:50.518 --> 39:53.478
Wow. Why?

39:53.521 --> 39:55.871
Like I told you
a million times...

39:55.915 --> 39:56.872
What the...

39:56.916 --> 39:58.700
Y-You realize your nephew,

39:58.744 --> 40:00.441
your godson,

40:00.485 --> 40:02.835
was one of the kids rounded up?

40:02.878 --> 40:05.968
He was a block from that truck.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.276
He got caught in the net, Jon.
Your net.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.060
Then you come to me.

40:11.104 --> 40:13.149
You don't just throw me
to the wolves, man.Oh...

40:14.586 --> 40:17.240
Here he is.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.429
As you were.

40:39.567 --> 40:42.962
Everybody know everything?

40:43.005 --> 40:44.398
Yes, sir.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.182
Yes, sir.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.839
I come from a cop family.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.276
'Cause of the change
in the demographics here,

40:53.320 --> 40:58.281
it's a, uh, dwindling tradition,
which makes each one left

40:58.325 --> 41:02.024
that much more valuable.

41:02.068 --> 41:05.027
A cop family

41:05.071 --> 41:07.203
that has black and white cops,

41:07.247 --> 41:10.772
one living
in the other's precinct,

41:10.816 --> 41:14.167
is pretty much unheard of.

41:14.210 --> 41:17.605
And about as valuable
as it gets.

41:17.649 --> 41:21.304
Potentially, anyway.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.916
Right.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.180
I hear you.

41:27.223 --> 41:30.009
I took another look
at your stats.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.446
Got a lot of question marks.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.318
Next round, I better not.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.755
Yes, sir.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.628
From now on,

41:40.672 --> 41:45.328
you better have his back
like you owe him your life.

41:45.372 --> 41:48.375
Your life
in this department, anyway.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.377
Yes, sir.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.554
You two have a good day.
