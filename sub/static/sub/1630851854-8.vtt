00:05.089 --> 00:07.591
WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.675 --> 00:11.345
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.974
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:41.792 --> 00:45.796
I have to remind you that
you can only answer yes or no.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.800
Is your name Cristiana Sinagra?

00:49.884 --> 00:50.801
Yes.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.653
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

01:56.033 --> 02:01.038
NAPLES, ITALY.

03:33.088 --> 03:33.964
Coming!

03:42.598 --> 03:44.099
What are you doing here?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.269
You invited me to dinner. Wasn't it today?

03:47.436 --> 03:50.147
What are you wearing? What did you bring?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.775
I'm not letting you in.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.526
Then I'm leaving.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.362
Come on in.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.875
-What a beautiful house.
-Thanks.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.086
Take that jacket off.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.357
Is your father very jealous?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.442
Maybe we should hide his scissors.

04:35.526 --> 04:39.571
My dad works as a hairdresser, he can
give you a haircut with those scissors.

04:39.655 --> 04:43.534
Anyways, I am going to take a shower.
You can finish here.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.245
-Me?
-Why, are you not able to?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.956
What do you think? I come from nothing.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.750
I was born in a neighborhood
poorer than this one.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.254
My mother would fake having a tummy ache
so we could eat.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.881
Sure, sure. Come on now, Maradó.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.552
Maradó, Maradó, these folks are crazy.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.637
They think I can't mop a floor.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.315
Try it.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.028
Is it tasty?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.580
I think we should find a good pizzeria...

05:30.039 --> 05:33.792
Baby, I prepare a dreamy ragou.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.005
I'm kidding. It's amazing.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.475
And you're a good kisser too.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.188
What about your engagement?

05:56.148 --> 05:58.400
It's a long, long story,

05:58.484 --> 06:02.154
but I am in love like the first day.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.201
I know that
there is no other woman like her,

06:09.078 --> 06:12.456
nobody whom I'll love more.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.708
But... Wasn't it over?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.836
It will never be over.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.089
What do you mean?

06:21.173 --> 06:24.301
Because... I won't leave Tota.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.553
-Your mother!
-Yes, my mom.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.853
Your dad is giving me a mean look.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.273
Sorry, Dad.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.245
You're tense.

06:52.913 --> 06:53.831
I'm scared.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.374
Scared of what?

06:57.292 --> 07:00.671
They say you are a womanizer.
That you take drugs.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.715
And that you are involved in the Camorra.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.094
What do you think?

07:09.304 --> 07:14.059
Do I seem like a mobster,
drug addict, womanizer?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.495
<i>San Paolo Stadium in Naples.</i>

07:33.579 --> 07:37.875
<i>Playing today Salvatore Bagni,</i>
<i>Moreno Ferrario, Alessandro Renica,</i>

07:37.958 --> 07:42.212
<i>Eraldo Pecci, Bruno Giordano,</i>
<i>Luigi Capparelli, Costanzo Celestini</i>

07:42.296 --> 07:45.591
<i>and, of course, the captain</i>
<i>Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

07:45.674 --> 07:50.220
<i>Maradona is struggling,</i>
<i>he is touching his knee.</i>

07:50.304 --> 07:53.223
<i>We see him in pain</i>
<i>in the middle of the field.</i>

08:01.899 --> 08:04.151
We don't think he can play,

08:04.318 --> 08:08.363
but doctor Oliva wants
to go ahead with the infiltrations.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.992
Dr. Oliva, we won't allow him
to play anesthetized.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.494
Excuse me,
I don't think Diego needs surgery.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.788
It's the muscle, not the bone.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.666
That's how they break permanently.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.667
I disagree.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.420
Thank you, but the club has the final say.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.715
What about me? Only Maradona decides
about Maradona's body.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.717
Wrong. Your contract with Napoli...

08:28.800 --> 08:31.678
Contract? I wipe my ass
with your contract, Ferlaino!

08:31.762 --> 08:33.555
Dr. Oliva is an eminence,

08:33.639 --> 08:35.933
he can teach the job to every one of you.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.574
<i>Napoli starts playing.</i>

08:53.283 --> 08:56.411
<i>We see Diego Maradona</i>
<i>with the ball between his feet.</i>

08:56.745 --> 08:59.248
<i>We see him hurt. And...</i>

08:59.373 --> 09:05.295
Foul on Diego Maradona.
They get him out in a stretcher.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.970
I broke it, it cracked.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.473
Don't worry, it's what I told you,
it's detached now.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.559
Let's do another shot.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.315
Come. Cover me, I'll give him a shot.

09:33.156 --> 09:37.202
Move it for a few minutes,
even if it hurts, and go out on the field.

09:37.828 --> 09:42.291
Diego! Diego!

09:42.874 --> 09:44.376
Trust me, you'll be fine.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.470
<i>Even with his injury,</i>
<i>he dodges the other players.</i>

09:56.388 --> 09:59.266
<i>He gets the ball, closes in on the goal,</i>
<i>left and...</i>

09:59.349 --> 10:03.061
<i>Goal, goal!</i>
<i>Goal from the Napoli captain!</i>

10:03.186 --> 10:05.272
<i>The public rejoices.</i>

10:05.355 --> 10:09.067
<i>The team members</i>
<i>want to hug their captain.</i>

10:09.693 --> 10:13.488
So where are the people who wanted
to send me for surgery now?

10:40.057 --> 10:43.352
That's enough, boys.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.772
<i>Oh, Mom, Mom, Mom</i>

10:46.855 --> 10:49.983
<i>You know why my heart beats?</i>

10:50.108 --> 10:53.904
<i>Because I saw Maradona, I saw Maradona</i>

10:54.029 --> 10:56.073
<i>Hey, Mom</i>

10:56.156 --> 10:58.575
Very nice, very nice.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.328
We'll meet some other time.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.373
He needs to sleep now,
he has practice in the morning.

11:04.456 --> 11:08.627
Some<i> ragazzas</i> are waiting for us
in the car. They're twins.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.962
-Party.
-Where did you find them?

11:11.046 --> 11:14.758
They were waiting in line
for an autograph.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.842
Hi.

11:15.967 --> 11:20.514
I approached them,
did my magic and left them...

11:21.681 --> 11:23.058
Ready for love.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.560
-Get it?
-Yes.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.604
-Yes.
-Did Rengo do this for you?

11:27.687 --> 11:28.563
No, he didn't.

11:29.147 --> 11:33.068
Besides, I got some good stuff
that gets you hard.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.444
-No way.
-It's true!

11:34.820 --> 11:35.904
I'd like to see that.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.447
Girls.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.243
Diego Armando Maradona.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.619
Hi, boy.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.872
-Alegra.
-How are you?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.165
-What's up?
-Love you.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.417
And I love you.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.919
-Yes.
-They are so beautiful.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.296
-Are you sure we won't go to jail?
-No.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.216
They'll be legal this year,
or the next one.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.802
All good, all legal, Diego.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.817
-It's wrong...
-It's ringing.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.819
Right.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.280
It's a cordless phone.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.867
To talk in the streets.
"Hello?" in the streets.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.578
Hello wherever you want. It's cordless.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.537
Yes.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.540
I'm still not used to it. Sorry.

12:29.040 --> 12:29.958
Hello?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.461
What's up? How are you?

12:32.544 --> 12:34.254
Worried about your knee.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.923
I almost died when you fell.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.719
I was scared too, but now I feel great.
It's okay now.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.763
What are you doing now?
Did you leave the stadium?

12:45.932 --> 12:50.645
I'm leaving with Guillermo.
We'll eat something and then home. You?

12:50.729 --> 12:51.771
I'm alone.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.358
Why don't you come here?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.068
I miss you.

12:57.944 --> 13:02.699
I miss you too,
but I have already made plans with him.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.201
<i>No problem, sweetheart.</i>

13:05.368 --> 13:06.453
See you tomorrow?

13:06.536 --> 13:07.704
<i>I can't tomorrow.</i>

13:07.829 --> 13:10.290
I'm going to Rome.
I'll be back on Saturday.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.501
<i>A week without seeing you?</i>

13:14.794 --> 13:16.213
I'm coming over now.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.589
Really?

13:18.089 --> 13:20.884
What about Guillermo?
Are you bringing him too?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.137
Don't worry,
he'll find himself something to do.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.766
Okay, I'll wait for you, my love. Bye.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.900
What's the matter, love? Are you sad?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.362
Everyone in Naples is sad.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.909
It was on the news today
that he's out of danger.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.494
Yeah, I know.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.498
There's people standing
outside the hospital for days.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.168
They write him letters,
pray for him, support him.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.171
I could write him a letter too.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.966
Of course you can write to him.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.220
Maybe now that he's almost dead,
he can read it.

14:06.096 --> 14:06.930
<i>Yes.</i>

14:07.764 --> 14:09.641
He might even answer this time.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.977
This time I'm sure he'll reply to you.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.650
<i>Diego is mine. Take Pelé.</i>

14:19.568 --> 14:21.987
<i>Who cares? Pelé is better than Maradona!</i>

14:22.404 --> 14:24.114
<i>Shut up! That's not true!</i>

14:24.239 --> 14:25.282
Diego, enough.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.868
Keep your voice down.
I have an important call to make.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.758
Sinagra.

14:44.009 --> 14:47.262
-She must want to know how Diego is.
-I'll get rid of her.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.055
Strange she didn't call earlier.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.224
Hi, Cristiana.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.728
-Hi, Claudia, how are you?
<i>-Trying not to give up.</i>

14:55.812 --> 14:58.106
<i>Is there a problem</i>
<i>with your son's allowance?</i>

14:58.481 --> 15:01.109
I had to delegate
everything to an accountant.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.778
I'm a little busy, as you can imagine.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.489
Of course,
I just want to know how Diego is.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.450
Better. Still under observation.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.787
Not sure if there'll be after-effects,
but the worst part is over.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.039
<i>Thank God.</i>

15:14.998 --> 15:17.709
How are you? How are the girls?

15:17.792 --> 15:18.960
Scared, obviously.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.796
Claudia, I don't want to impose.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.426
My son is very concerned
about his father's health.

15:26.635 --> 15:30.221
It would comfort him to hear his voice.
Even if just once.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.600
Cristiana, I swear I understand you.

15:34.517 --> 15:38.021
Diego never wanted to talk to your son,
and that won't change.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.441
Claudia, please.
From one mother to another.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.486
<i>It's hard to see a child in pain.</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:47.530
Diego rejects you, Cristiana,
what should I do?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.949
Why am I to blame for your relationship?

15:50.909 --> 15:54.788
Okay, Claudia. I'm sorry.
You're absolutely right.

15:57.540 --> 16:01.211
I'm sorry, I'm a little overwhelmed.
Forgive me.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.465
<i>Could my son write a letter to Diego?</i>

16:05.548 --> 16:08.677
If I send it to your email,
could you show it to him?

16:09.427 --> 16:12.681
Okay, I will try to get him to read it.
But no promises.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.600
<i>Okay, Claudia. Thanks.</i>

16:27.570 --> 16:30.323
She wants the boy
to write a letter to Diego.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.619
As if Diego cared about anyone.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.916
His only concern is himself.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.334
-No, Claudia, stop.
-What?

16:41.418 --> 16:43.628
-He cares about his daughters.
-Sure, yes.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.588
Dalma and Giannina, sure.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.676
He always talks about them,
and then he does this.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.639
-He overdoses. He's there, in a bed.
-He can't control it.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.641
And if he kills himself?

16:57.934 --> 17:01.020
How many kids
does Diego have in the world?

17:01.521 --> 17:05.817
He has slept with every woman he met.
He doesn't like to wear condoms.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.403
That's his whim, he doesn't wear them.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.114
-People talk, but...
-Are you defending him?

17:11.448 --> 17:12.490
Will you deny it?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.326
You know I'm right.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.123
<i>My name is Diego Armando, like you,</i>

17:20.206 --> 17:25.253
<i>and like many other Neapolitan boys</i>
<i>who were born while you were playing here.</i>

17:25.712 --> 17:28.465
<i>But, among all of those Diego Armandos,</i>

17:28.840 --> 17:32.343
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>whose surname is Maradona.</i>

17:32.677 --> 17:37.098
<i>My family tells me I rooted for Argentina</i>
<i>in the 1990 World Cup</i>

17:37.182 --> 17:39.184
<i>when I was only four,</i>

17:39.267 --> 17:42.145
<i>without knowing you were my dad.</i>

17:42.228 --> 17:45.690
<i>So it seems</i>
<i>I carry a piece of your heart in mine.</i>

17:45.815 --> 17:47.901
<i>The only thing is,</i>

17:47.984 --> 17:51.029
<i>please don't get mad,</i>
<i>but my favorite Argentinian team</i>

17:51.112 --> 17:52.655
<i>is River, your main rival.</i>

17:56.117 --> 17:57.744
<i>I wasn't able to meet you,</i>

17:57.827 --> 18:01.039
<i>but being your son makes me very proud,</i>

18:01.122 --> 18:03.833
<i>even if, at times,</i>
<i>people don't believe it.</i>

18:05.043 --> 18:06.669
<i>The rest of the time,</i>

18:06.753 --> 18:09.005
<i>people know me</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:11.633
<i>and look at me</i>
<i>to see if I am left-footed too.</i>

18:12.008 --> 18:15.220
<i>They are disappointed</i>
<i>when they find out that I am not.</i>

18:16.054 --> 18:19.140
<i>Anyway, they say I am a good player.</i>

18:19.224 --> 18:23.019
<i>Not as good as my dad, of course.</i>
<i>I am only human.</i>

18:23.102 --> 18:25.355
<i>You are considered a god.</i>

18:26.606 --> 18:28.858
<i>I hope you can answer my letter.</i>

18:29.150 --> 18:32.237
<i>I'd love to know something about you</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:34.447
<i>that doesn't come from newspapers or TV.</i>

18:34.531 --> 18:38.076
<i>Hugs. Hoping to be able</i>
<i>to get to know you soon.</i>

19:02.016 --> 19:03.726
How do I get to the World Cup?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.895
You have the best physical trainer.

19:06.896 --> 19:11.067
Listen, Diego.
There's an Italian cyclist called Moser

19:11.568 --> 19:13.653
who has just broken a record in Mexico.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.573
Something unreal
for an athlete used to cool climates.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.534
-Let's find out how he did it.
-I already did.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.496
The doctor who trained him
has a training center in Rome.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.164
-Shall I call him?
-Yes.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.126
But tell the guy not to say anything.

19:28.751 --> 19:32.046
If those stupid journalists find out,
and you know them,

19:32.630 --> 19:36.342
they'll say Maradona's mind is
on the World Cup, not on Napoli.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.719
Don't worry, Diego.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.347
Napoli is not playing for anything, right?

19:41.431 --> 19:45.894
That's why I don't care.
My mind set on the World Cup.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.397
You know how this works,
you have to save face.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.690
Okay, go, continue.

19:51.816 --> 19:52.734
Under.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.493
-Goal!
-Goal!

20:52.293 --> 20:54.671
<i>Napoli have now</i>
<i>gone four games without a win.</i>

20:54.754 --> 20:58.424
People say you are only
thinking about the World Cup.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.509
What people?

20:59.592 --> 21:03.054
Your neighbor, your sister, your mother?

21:03.137 --> 21:06.849
Losing and winning
are both part of the game.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.269
And besides,
Napoli is more than just Diego Maradona.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.982
But what is more important to you,
the World Cup or Napoli?

21:14.482 --> 21:17.944
The two things are connected.

21:18.027 --> 21:23.074
To do good there,
I need to give it all here, in Napoli.

21:23.366 --> 21:27.578
And I want to ask the Argentines
to stop attacking Bilardo,

21:27.829 --> 21:29.706
and the national team players.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.418
They believe all the bullshit they hear,
and those are lies

21:33.668 --> 21:37.380
to create conflict,
and we players are all on the same boat.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.425
So your relationship
with Passarella isn't worse?

21:41.217 --> 21:44.554
Please, I really admire Passarella.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.182
He's a world champion,
he gave us the qualification for Mexico.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.102
Come on, guys. Please, be serious.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.984
She arrives, spectacular as always.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.446
-And I recognize her from TV.
-Yes.

22:02.071 --> 22:05.950
So, I approach the owner of the club,
a friend of mine,

22:06.743 --> 22:10.246
and ask him, I sometimes have,
if she has a boyfriend.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.041
-I was single.
-And what does he say?

22:14.125 --> 22:19.297
-That Yayita had asked about me too.
-That's a lie! I didn't!

22:19.672 --> 22:22.175
Let me be a playboy!

22:22.300 --> 22:25.136
-Okay, say whatever you want.
-Just once!

22:25.219 --> 22:29.599
Well, I approach her, we go to the bar,
have a drink, loosen up,

22:29.766 --> 22:34.187
we start making out, and I,
the anxious one,

22:34.312 --> 22:38.316
start thinking which is
the best motel near the club.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.069
-Guille.
-Listen.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.657
Right at that moment, they call me
to tell me my best friend's dad died.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.910
I swear it happened.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.661
-I swear.
-It's true.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.413
I swear.

22:52.622 --> 22:56.459
I tell Yayita, "Look, I want you to know
something from here on out."

22:56.584 --> 23:00.004
-Yes.
-"To me, friends are everything."

23:01.297 --> 23:02.924
He did. I loved it.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.967
"You should know that.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.470
So, I have to go to a wake."

23:07.553 --> 23:09.889
-And what did she say?
-"I'll go with you."

23:10.098 --> 23:14.060
-What could I say?
-Since she was wearing a golden miniskirt.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.853
You remember the color, baby!

23:16.020 --> 23:19.190
-I took her home to change.
-Nothing happened there!

23:19.273 --> 23:22.360
-We went to the wake.
-I was very respectful, right?

23:22.485 --> 23:24.946
-I was wearing black.
-You were serene.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.531
You were serene.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.866
I asked everybody,

23:29.242 --> 23:31.452
"What do you want? What do you need?"

23:31.577 --> 23:33.955
I was there for support.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.375
-Yes, but it was long.
-We were there for like eight hours.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.711
-It was long.
-And you know what happened next?

23:42.130 --> 23:43.297
After the wake,

23:45.091 --> 23:46.217
there was a burial.

23:47.969 --> 23:51.806
No, that's not true!
No! Don't believe him!

23:51.931 --> 23:53.516
It wasn't like that!

23:54.308 --> 23:55.309
Baby!

23:56.561 --> 23:57.562
Mom, look.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.356
They make a cute couple.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.865
Are you crazy? They'll put us in jail.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.700
Didn't you want a special night?

24:52.783 --> 24:55.369
Tell me, what could be
more special than this?

25:25.942 --> 25:27.109
It's beautiful.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.697
Take in the smell of the grass.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.242
It's one of a kind.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.915
Imagine if we stayed the night here

25:42.583 --> 25:47.046
and tomorrow
we opened our eyes to a full stadium.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.177
I feel like I'm dreaming.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.851
I have a surprise for you.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.104
-Really?
-Yes.

26:04.814 --> 26:09.110
I also have a surprise.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.698
You go first.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.541
I can't take you to the moon,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.169
but I can bring the moon down to my feet.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.532
Come on, boss! What are you doing?
I told you, when I kick!

26:57.074 --> 26:58.326
Go to hell.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.795
I never thought you were this sweet.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.718
I saw you on TV, and you seemed arrogant.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.971
Like all Argentines.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.307
What's this?

27:22.141 --> 27:26.354
A magical night,
or a night to criticize me?

27:36.447 --> 27:37.365
Diego.

27:38.783 --> 27:39.658
What?

27:46.332 --> 27:47.416
I'm pregnant.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.216
Doesn't that make you happy?

27:56.759 --> 27:57.760
Sure it does.

27:59.470 --> 28:00.513
It's just that...

28:02.014 --> 28:04.016
It's not the best time, because...

28:05.184 --> 28:07.436
I'm leaving to play in the World Cup.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.565
But if that's what God wanted...

28:12.983 --> 28:15.027
-I'm happy.
-I love you.

28:19.865 --> 28:20.908
Me too.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.663
But I have to go.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.270
Diego.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.150
I'll miss you.

29:36.567 --> 29:37.401
It's me.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.460
Hi, honey.

29:57.004 --> 30:01.008
We have a doctor's phone number,
in case you want to have an abortion.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.052
Girl, don't be an idiot.

30:03.302 --> 30:07.306
-Wasn't I supposed to tell him?
-Not like this, you'll scare him.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.560
This is tearing me apart.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.230
She's so excited.

30:14.313 --> 30:19.318
Yes, dear. Nothing would make me happier
than you giving me grandchildren.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.238
But it's like you say,

30:23.030 --> 30:24.740
it's not the right time.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.119
The World Cup is coming,
you'll be far away.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.122
Will the girl stay here alone, pregnant?

30:34.208 --> 30:35.084
No.

30:36.961 --> 30:37.920
Besides...

30:40.381 --> 30:42.424
You know the mayhem that's coming.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.926
What's so funny?

30:46.220 --> 30:48.222
-Tell me, so we can all laugh.
-Yes.

30:48.806 --> 30:53.435
No, it's just that I thought of Claudia's
face when she learns Diego will be a dad.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.229
Diego won't be anybody's dad.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.439
Aren't you paying attention?

31:10.661 --> 31:11.537
Cristiana.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.915
This baby thing cannot go on.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.503
What are you saying, Diego?

31:21.422 --> 31:22.923
You have to terminate it.

31:25.801 --> 31:26.635
Never.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.140
It's not forever. It's just this year.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.809
I have to be focused on the World Cup.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.061
What the fuck
are you talking about, Diego?

31:36.145 --> 31:38.772
Next year we can, really,
I give you my word.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.275
Your word isn't worth shit.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.953
Tomorrow, Maria will fetch you
and take you to the doctor.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.246
Do you understand?

31:56.957 --> 31:58.250
Is that an order?

31:59.752 --> 32:00.836
Do as you please.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.757
-Wait.
-Touch my child and I'll kill you. Got it?

32:20.564 --> 32:21.940
It did seem weird.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.401
It was too good to be true.

32:34.662 --> 32:39.416
If you didn't get a good sleep,
you can have breakfast and sleep all day.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.669
The advantages of being hospitalized.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.128
I want to get out.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.468
-I want to get out.
-So grumpy today, Maradona.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.553
What woke you up? Tell me.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.847
I'm not myself here.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.435
Thank goodness.
By being yourself, you ended up here.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.230
You'll have to change your habits
when you leave.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.273
I don't want to change.

33:03.357 --> 33:04.817
Okay, Diego.

33:04.942 --> 33:08.195
-Get this shit off me.
-Calm down, Diego. Calm down.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.030
-And Claudia?
-She's not here yet.

33:10.114 --> 33:11.657
-Where is she?
-Not here yet.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.367
She didn't come yet.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.119
-And Guillermo?
-Calm down.

33:15.285 --> 33:17.413
-Calm down!
-Fuck you!

33:17.496 --> 33:19.248
-Calm down.
-Get me a phone.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.042
-I can't! Sergio! Sergio!
-Get me a phone, bitch!

33:22.126 --> 33:24.586
-Sergio!
-Get me a phone, motherfucker!

33:25.129 --> 33:26.171
Bitch!

33:29.758 --> 33:31.427
Motherfucker!

33:32.261 --> 33:33.470
Motherfuckers.

33:58.746 --> 34:01.457
Look at what this Ferro Viera said.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.834
"The marriage no longer exists,

34:04.543 --> 34:09.256
Claudia and Diego have been separated
for a couple of years.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.967
She keeps up appearances

34:12.676 --> 34:16.430
because they have
a business relationship.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.768
The truth is that the only thing
that matters to Claudia

34:21.727 --> 34:24.480
is the 'Maradona' brand.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.441
She is a very greedy woman.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.820
It's impressive how much
she accumulates while Diego

34:33.238 --> 34:35.449
walks around without a penny.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.202
She keeps on amassing money
at his expense

34:38.285 --> 34:40.788
and manages the business with Guillermo.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.998
Everything goes through her.

34:43.332 --> 34:46.251
The contracts, Diego's management,

34:46.877 --> 34:49.671
the properties and assets they have".

34:55.677 --> 34:56.762
Is that true?

34:57.596 --> 35:01.099
No, Mom, it's all lies.
That Ferro guy is sick.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.935
But he's Diego's friend.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.019
Well.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.437
Who's sick?

35:06.355 --> 35:10.692
Mind your own business. Why are you here,
listening to adult conversations?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.110
Go play, go on.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.535
I think Dad is sick.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.121
Is he going to die?

35:33.632 --> 35:35.843
Juana told me
they've been outside all night.

35:37.386 --> 35:40.722
-Who tipped them off?
-Must've been Cristiana.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.641
Or someone from her family.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.520
-I'm canceling training.
-No way.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.023
They're expecting us in Rome,
and we're going.

35:50.107 --> 35:53.402
I won't change my plans
because of these idiots.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.613
We can't go out, Diego.
They're blocking the entrance.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.449
There's a TV van there.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.077
I talked to Morsa, he'll handle it.

36:02.578 --> 36:06.081
Man, I thought these things
only happened in Argentina,

36:06.164 --> 36:07.916
but they're all the same.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.502
These motherfuckers smell blood

36:10.586 --> 36:14.089
and they're all over you.
They're vampires, not journalists.

36:39.156 --> 36:41.450
Come on, man! Come on!

36:50.876 --> 36:53.670
Go, go!

36:54.880 --> 36:57.090
Come on! Come on, Diego!

37:07.976 --> 37:10.312
Diego, slow down, we'll kill ourselves.

37:12.064 --> 37:15.442
Diego, we lost them. Slow down. Calm down.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.819
Motherfuckers, they don't let me live.

37:18.445 --> 37:21.531
But killing yourself
won't get you anywhere. Stop it.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.003
Maradona!

37:35.087 --> 37:37.714
Maradó, I love you! Diego, I love you!

37:41.051 --> 37:44.638
<i>While Maradona and the rest</i>
<i>of the national team players</i>

37:44.721 --> 37:47.975
<i>playing in Europe are preparing</i>
<i>for the World Cup</i>

37:48.058 --> 37:51.228
<i>in top-level training centers</i>

37:51.311 --> 37:54.773
<i>and under the tutelage</i>
<i>of the best professionals in the world,</i>

37:54.940 --> 37:58.568
<i>their coach, Carlos Salvador Bilardo,</i>

37:58.652 --> 38:01.905
<i>continues to make</i>
<i>incomprehensible decisions.</i>

38:03.949 --> 38:05.701
<i>To the trees.</i>

38:06.243 --> 38:10.455
<i>This time, he traveled</i>
<i>1,400 kilometers with his players</i>

38:10.580 --> 38:15.627
<i>to stay in Tilcara, a town lost</i>
<i>in the highlands of Jujuy.</i>

38:16.169 --> 38:20.716
<i>According to Bilardo, it is to adapt</i>
<i>to the altitude they may face in Mexico.</i>

38:21.008 --> 38:25.679
<i>It would be worth asking him</i>
<i>if they will also visit a seismic zone</i>

38:25.762 --> 38:27.222
<i>to adapt to earthquakes.</i>

38:28.682 --> 38:32.352
<i>The fact is that today,</i>
<i>top-level international players</i>

38:32.811 --> 38:35.063
<i>train in these conditions,</i>

38:35.647 --> 38:38.525
<i>which are more typical of an amateur team</i>

38:39.735 --> 38:41.903
<i>than of a national team of a country</i>

38:41.987 --> 38:45.490
<i>that only eight years ago</i>
<i>was crowned world champion.</i>

39:00.422 --> 39:02.883
-Is it okay? Should I lower it?
-I'm good.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.636
When is the pizza coming?

39:13.727 --> 39:14.561
Juana?

39:19.399 --> 39:20.442
Juana?

39:27.115 --> 39:28.492
The flight was perfect.

39:29.076 --> 39:33.330
But there was a strike,
it took them two hours to get my suitcase.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.626
Don't worry, I'll tell him
that you sent the magazines.

39:38.585 --> 39:42.214
Yes. Okay. And the dulce de leche too.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.550
I have to go. Bye.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.181
-What are you doing here, Claudia?
-Hello.

39:54.518 --> 39:55.727
I like your beard.

39:59.523 --> 40:03.443
In Buenos Aires they say you're depressed,
that's why you grew it.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.278
Don't play dumb. Why are you here?

40:06.488 --> 40:09.366
Your siblings told me
you're going through a bad time.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.743
And I wanted to come and join you.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.287
I won't impose, though.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.498
I can go to a hotel.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.376
And Juana?

40:19.459 --> 40:22.003
I told her to leave,
so we could talk alone.

40:26.716 --> 40:29.219
I love you. I love you.

40:48.697 --> 40:49.739
Are you okay?

40:51.324 --> 40:52.242
Diego.

41:07.507 --> 41:11.261
Excuse me, do you know
if they took Diego for tests?

41:11.344 --> 41:12.345
No. Why?

41:13.263 --> 41:15.390
-Because he's not in his room.
-What?

41:16.558 --> 41:19.269
-What's wrong?
-I think your friend escaped.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.229
He escaped?

41:27.819 --> 41:28.737
Maradona.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.948
Can I play?

41:35.202 --> 41:36.119
No.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.206
We're six against six.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.584
What a snitch, man.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.379
Are you really going to miss
playing with the number ten?

41:48.381 --> 41:50.967
You don't look like Maradona.
You look different.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.135
Different how?

41:52.969 --> 41:55.764
-I don't know.
-Fatter. Like bloated.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.390
Older.

41:58.475 --> 42:03.271
Fat, old, and bloated,
I can still beat you.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.357
Stupid Uruguayans.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.026
Who did you ever beat, bitches?

42:08.944 --> 42:10.779
Fucking kids. Bitches.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.448
Fucking kids.

42:16.326 --> 42:17.661
Fucking kids.

42:18.370 --> 42:21.164
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

42:21.248 --> 42:24.793
I'm sick of being locked in that clinic
like a prisoner, Claudia.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.544
You came here by yourself.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.547
That's why I am discharging myself today.

42:29.714 --> 42:30.632
Let's calm down.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.009
-Let's calm down.
-Guille.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.638
Do you want me to calm down?
Bring Ferrito or Morsa.

42:36.888 --> 42:40.058
That's what you need, drugs!
That's why you're like this!

42:40.392 --> 42:43.812
I behaved well. I was like a duke,
Claudia, what are you saying?

42:44.437 --> 42:47.274
-What?
-You got here almost dead!

42:48.441 --> 42:50.986
Do you want to die?

42:51.069 --> 42:54.698
That's what you want? Then die already!
And leave us alone!

42:54.823 --> 42:57.117
-I won't give you the pleasure, bitch!
-Okay.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.704
I won't give you the pleasure, bitch!
You ruined my life!

43:00.829 --> 43:03.915
-You ruined my life.
-Okay, let's go for a walk.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.667
-And we'll go back.
-Guille.

43:05.834 --> 43:08.086
Only two lines, and I'll calm down.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.172
-No.
-Doctors don't understand, you know?

43:11.965 --> 43:15.176
A guy like me can't change overnight.

43:15.385 --> 43:17.804
-I don't know what happened.
-I can't change.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.849
-Why does she hate me?
-Hate you?

43:21.182 --> 43:22.100
Claudia loves you.

43:22.309 --> 43:25.979
You should have seen her,
always by your side, Diego.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.148
Come here, listen to me.

43:28.356 --> 43:29.983
Let's go. Trust me.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.861
Your ass is hanging out.
You exhibitionist. Come.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.573
Are you Sinagra?

43:38.450 --> 43:39.659
Sorry?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.372
So you are the Sinagra whore!

43:46.708 --> 43:48.668
What the fuck were you thinking?

43:49.210 --> 43:51.296
Remember that Maradona is immortal.

43:52.589 --> 43:53.840
Maradona never dies.

43:57.177 --> 43:59.721
Aren't you ashamed?
In front of your daughter?

43:59.804 --> 44:02.557
My daughter has to know
that you are a parasite.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.060
Sorry, excuse me.

44:05.393 --> 44:08.980
Have you seen her? She's a parasite.

44:09.064 --> 44:10.732
A bloodsucker.

44:10.815 --> 44:15.320
You need to get settled with the house
you are stealing from Maradona.

44:15.779 --> 44:18.198
-Sinagra.
-You know, right? Did you get it?

44:18.281 --> 44:22.827
<i>-Oh, Mom, Mom, Mom.</i>
<i>-</i>Leave alone.

44:23.036 --> 44:26.373
<i>-You know why my heart beats?</i>
-Let me through!

44:26.456 --> 44:29.793
Let me go! Asshole!
What do you know about my life?

44:31.378 --> 44:33.171
This fucking psycho.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.256
Fuck you, asshole.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.301
Come here, darling.

44:41.638 --> 44:43.807
<i>Tonight, the lie detector machine</i>

44:43.973 --> 44:48.895
<i>will demonstrate that electronics can</i>
<i>defeat the intimate desire to lie.</i>

44:48.978 --> 44:52.941
<i>Nowadays technology is able to say</i>
<i>whether someone lies or is sincere.</i>

44:53.733 --> 44:57.028
<i>Tonight, voice of the story,</i>
<i>you'll have understood by now,</i>

44:57.195 --> 45:00.156
<i>is the story from</i>
<i>Cristiana Sinagra and her son.</i>

45:00.281 --> 45:02.992
<i>It's a common story, if you will,</i>
<i>that of a paternity</i>

45:03.076 --> 45:06.704
<i>which was asked, affirmed, claimed, </i>
<i>that of Diego Armando Maradona,</i>

45:06.871 --> 45:08.540
<i>who always denied it.</i>

45:10.417 --> 45:12.669
<i>Is your name Cristiana Sinagra?</i>

45:12.752 --> 45:13.628
<i>Yes.</i>

45:19.634 --> 45:21.928
<i>-Do you live in Italy?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

45:29.519 --> 45:33.231
<i>Did you warn Diego that you were ovulating</i>

45:33.314 --> 45:35.942
<i>-when the child was conceived?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

45:40.238 --> 45:43.199
<i>Is Diego Armando Maradona</i>
<i>the father of your child?</i>

45:43.283 --> 45:44.117
Yes.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.999
<i>The test is over,</i>
<i>she will stay there for now.</i>

45:55.670 --> 45:59.174
<i>Is Diego Armando Maradona</i>
<i>the father of her child? Your conclusion?</i>

45:59.257 --> 46:01.259
<i>What answers did she give?</i>

46:02.719 --> 46:06.014
<i>She answered this question "yes."</i>

46:07.432 --> 46:09.350
<i>And she was telling the truth.</i>

46:10.059 --> 46:11.853
<i>And she was telling the truth.</i>

46:17.859 --> 46:19.277
Fucking witch.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.739
-Are you talking to me?
-No.

46:24.365 --> 46:26.910
-You talk to yourself now?
-Don't fuck with me.

46:31.831 --> 46:32.832
What are you doing?

46:34.167 --> 46:35.877
-What?
-Are you mocking me?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.129
Why are you sniffing?

46:38.213 --> 46:40.340
-Why?
-You're so paranoid.

46:40.924 --> 46:42.175
I have allergies.

46:45.762 --> 46:49.599
<i>I was lost before I heard the word</i>
<i>of Pastor Villalba.</i>

46:51.059 --> 46:53.353
<i>I was a drug addict,</i>
<i>I couldn't stop using.</i>

46:54.354 --> 46:57.941
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that made sense to me was drugs.</i>

46:58.024 --> 47:00.276
<i>I was roasting in the slow fire of hell.</i>

47:00.777 --> 47:04.531
<i>Satan was next to me,</i>
<i>but Pastor Villalba took me by the hand.</i>

47:05.323 --> 47:08.618
<i>He took me and my wife in</i>
<i>and saved us both.</i>

47:10.870 --> 47:12.830
<i>I was a man living on drugs.</i>

47:13.414 --> 47:14.707
<i>Now I am healed.</i>

47:17.752 --> 47:20.588
<i>I met Jesus. Jesus.</i>

47:22.423 --> 47:26.761
I think I might have
to go see Pastor Villalba.

47:26.928 --> 47:28.054
Yeah.

47:29.222 --> 47:31.683
-Do you need anything before I leave?
-No.

47:35.937 --> 47:37.981
-Here.
-What is it?

47:39.399 --> 47:40.483
It's from Sinagra.

47:42.986 --> 47:44.237
From your son.

48:04.299 --> 48:06.092
I have two daughters.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.970
Dalma and Giannina.

48:14.350 --> 48:18.479
<i>Welcome to the last day</i>
<i>of the championship. We are in Naples.</i>

48:19.314 --> 48:23.568
<i>The San Paolo Stadium in Naples, where</i>
<i>Napoli will face off against Sampdoria.</i>

48:23.651 --> 48:29.115
<i>Here we see, Maradona on the left,</i>
<i>dominating the ball with his legs,</i>

48:29.198 --> 48:30.992
<i>but his play is blocked.</i>

48:31.117 --> 48:34.537
<i>Now we see Napoli pushing, pushing hard.</i>

48:34.621 --> 48:37.665
<i>We go forward, the player Giordano.</i>
<i>Giordano. Goal!</i>

48:37.790 --> 48:41.002
<i>One to zero for Napoli on Sampdoria.</i>

48:41.127 --> 48:43.254
<i>The whole stadium celebrates the team.</i>

48:43.338 --> 48:45.715
<i>Here comes Maradona, an assist,</i>

48:45.798 --> 48:49.385
<i>Giordano's second goal,</i>
<i>he runs under the curve.</i>

48:49.469 --> 48:52.513
<i>All the San Paolo Stadium</i>
<i>in Naples unleashes.</i>

49:53.658 --> 49:54.701
Angelito.

49:55.284 --> 49:56.411
Come here, Diego.

49:58.204 --> 50:02.417
I promised you the shirt for
your grandson, but they took it from me.

50:02.583 --> 50:03.751
It doesn't matter.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.921
I'll buy him a random jersey
and tell him it's yours.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.882
-How are you?
-Same as always.

50:11.634 --> 50:13.720
I'm praying to God Almighty, Diego.

50:14.303 --> 50:18.391
I light a candle to San Gennaro
to have Argentina win the World Cup.

50:18.891 --> 50:20.685
If they hear you, they'll kill you.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.229
Why? I only support friends.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.357
Go Argentina.

50:26.941 --> 50:30.319
Go Argentina!

50:30.611 --> 50:33.239
See? Nothing happened.

50:35.408 --> 50:36.451
What about you?

50:37.827 --> 50:39.579
Good. Good.

50:41.581 --> 50:42.707
I don't know,

50:43.040 --> 50:44.333
I see you are sad.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.798
You didn't insult the referee today.

50:51.507 --> 50:53.468
You didn't stick your tongue out.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.095
You didn't fight
with any of the opposition.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.932
And that means I'm sad?

51:00.808 --> 51:01.726
Yes.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.061
You have to be okay, Diego.

51:06.063 --> 51:10.693
Hey. The last thing you need is
to fall apart just before your World Cup.

51:12.945 --> 51:15.239
-My World Cup?
-Yes, Diego.

51:15.907 --> 51:17.617
This will be your world cup.

51:17.700 --> 51:21.412
Otherwise, what was the point of
having them in Mexico, so high up.

51:21.496 --> 51:23.122
To make you shine,

51:23.206 --> 51:25.458
so that the defense cannot get to you.

51:25.541 --> 51:26.793
Listen to me,

51:26.876 --> 51:30.338
this will be a world cup
without man-to-man marking.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.839
Remember these words.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.134
So now you need to be happy.

51:36.427 --> 51:39.180
-What is being happy?
-What?

51:40.056 --> 51:42.308
You don't know what happiness is?

51:43.601 --> 51:45.228
Diego, what are you saying?

51:46.771 --> 51:47.980
Don't make me laugh.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.193
What about the night you snuck in here
with that girl?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.028
You think I was sleeping?

51:54.111 --> 51:57.865
What is that, if not happiness?

51:59.826 --> 52:01.202
The golden boy.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.956
Maradona is better than Pelé.

52:06.958 --> 52:09.210
And you don't know what happiness is.

52:10.837 --> 52:12.672
Maradona is better than Pelé.

53:11.439 --> 53:12.481
Are you ready?

53:13.524 --> 53:15.568
-Yes.
-I'll miss you a lot.

53:18.613 --> 53:21.073
Don't worry,
they say I'll be back first round.

53:21.157 --> 53:22.450
I hope not.

53:23.784 --> 53:27.288
I'd rather miss you, but you stay
until the last day of the Cup.

53:29.498 --> 53:30.750
-I love you.
-Me too.

53:32.710 --> 53:33.878
Change that face.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.881
-Should I carry this one?
-Okay.

54:12.667 --> 54:16.420
We'll talk every day.
If anything comes up,

54:16.587 --> 54:18.464
let me know, I'll solve it.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.551
Great.

54:28.474 --> 54:31.227
Stefano, take a right,
I have to go somewhere.

55:02.216 --> 55:05.011
-Don't you have to be in Mexico?
-I'm on my way.

55:06.679 --> 55:08.305
So what are you doing here?

55:09.974 --> 55:11.851
I treated you badly last time.

55:12.435 --> 55:13.811
I am sorry about that.

55:14.979 --> 55:17.940
I've been thinking a lot
about the three of us.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.652
Did you think of something new?

55:23.112 --> 55:24.238
No, the same.

55:25.281 --> 55:27.992
Leave then.
I haven't changed my mind either.

55:32.413 --> 55:34.331
Cristiana, go in the other room.

55:35.624 --> 55:36.959
Why did you come here?

55:38.669 --> 55:40.087
Why did you come here?

55:42.423 --> 55:43.799
We are humble people,

55:45.176 --> 55:46.969
but we have our dignity.

55:47.762 --> 55:48.721
Goodbye.

56:01.525 --> 56:05.988
RAI's special program "The truth about
Cristiana Sinagra's Pregnancy"

56:06.072 --> 56:10.493
was not broadcast at the time,
due to a request from Diego Maradona.

56:10.618 --> 56:14.080
The ban was carried out by
his influential Italian friends.

56:14.914 --> 56:18.417
Diego Junior, like his father,
played soccer professionally.

56:18.501 --> 56:22.088
He played in Napoli's youth teams
and the U-17 national team.

56:22.171 --> 56:25.758
Maradona publicly recognized him
as his son in 2016 at age 29.

56:26.425 --> 56:28.094
Since his time in Cebollitas,

56:28.177 --> 56:31.972
Maradona required regular injections
to be able to continue to play.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.475
In 2019, a prosthesis
was placed in his knee.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.471
<i>I don't have cops, I have...</i>

57:12.555 --> 57:17.226
<i>I have two men, two cops</i>
<i>that make room for me to go to trainings.</i>

57:17.309 --> 57:20.437
But they don't use any weapons.

57:20.521 --> 57:22.523
They don't hurt people.

58:57.743 --> 58:58.869
Stop!
