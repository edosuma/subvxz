36:23.615 --> 36:24.878
across the street?

36:24.920 --> 36:26.313
XANDER:
And when did they

36:26.358 --> 36:27.880
make it night over there?

36:34.844 --> 36:37.411
Whose nightmare is this?

36:37.456 --> 36:39.719
GILES:
It's mine.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.775
I failed...

36:54.559 --> 36:56.605
...in my duty to protect you.

36:59.565 --> 37:03.177
I should've been more...
cautious,

37:03.221 --> 37:05.614
taken more time to train you.

37:07.398 --> 37:09.400
But you were so gifted.

37:12.751 --> 37:14.797
And the evil was so great.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.672
I'm sorry.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.244
Ah!

37:27.288 --> 37:27.853
[screams]

37:27.896 --> 37:30.248
Aah! Ah!

37:34.425 --> 37:35.688
Buffy?

37:38.125 --> 37:39.996
Thought I was dead.

37:40.039 --> 37:41.476
Buffy, your face.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.135
Oh, God.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.880
Buffy...

37:54.923 --> 37:56.056
Don't look at me.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.367
You never told me

38:02.409 --> 38:05.413
you dreamt of
becoming a vampire.

38:05.456 --> 38:07.632
This isn't a dream.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.896
No. No, it's not.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.900
But there's a chance
we can make it go away.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.076
This all comes
from Billy.

38:16.119 --> 38:18.512
Now, if we can
only wake him up,

38:18.556 --> 38:19.992
I believe that the
nightmares will stop

38:20.036 --> 38:21.342
and reality will shift
back into place.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.126
But we must do it now.

38:24.518 --> 38:25.737
I need you
to hold together

38:25.780 --> 38:27.217
long enough to help us.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.914
Can you do that?

38:36.139 --> 38:37.793
Yeah.

38:37.836 --> 38:39.664
I-I think I can.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.275
Thank you.

38:45.192 --> 38:47.324
Well, we better hurry...

38:47.367 --> 38:49.369
'Cause I'm getting hungry.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.458
That is a...

38:51.503 --> 38:53.331
joke, right?

38:53.373 --> 38:55.985
Are you sure everything will
go back once he's awake?

38:56.028 --> 38:57.639
Oh, uh, positive.

38:57.682 --> 38:59.074
Well, how do we
wake Billy up?

38:59.119 --> 39:00.467
What if we can't?

39:00.512 --> 39:03.644
Willow, do shut up.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.911
[clamoring]

39:08.954 --> 39:11.958
Doctor, is the boy Billy
still here?

39:12.001 --> 39:13.219
My hands.

39:13.262 --> 39:15.264
Ohh, ohh...

39:20.313 --> 39:21.489
What now?

39:21.532 --> 39:22.969
Um...

39:23.012 --> 39:24.273
Billy!

39:26.364 --> 39:27.581
Billy!

39:27.626 --> 39:28.713
BILLY:
That won't work.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.195
Billy.

39:33.239 --> 39:34.501
Uh, Billy,

39:34.545 --> 39:35.590
you have to
wake up.

39:35.634 --> 39:36.938
BILLY:
No, I told her.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.114
I have to hide.GILES:
Why?

39:39.159 --> 39:41.422
From what?
From him.

39:41.465 --> 39:43.163
[growling]

39:45.686 --> 39:46.862
XANDER:
Oh, man, what do we do?

39:46.905 --> 39:48.907
I think I know.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.086
[buzzing]

39:54.130 --> 39:56.262
Whatever it is,
it better be soon.

39:57.219 --> 39:59.440
Glad you showed up.

39:59.483 --> 40:02.268
You see, I'm having
a really bad day.

40:02.311 --> 40:04.313
Lucky 19.

40:04.358 --> 40:05.619
Scary.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.360
I'll tell you something, though.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.362
There are a lot scarier things
than you.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.152
And I'm one of them.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.634
[roars]

40:29.077 --> 40:31.079
[snarling]

40:33.126 --> 40:35.257
[grunting]

40:44.572 --> 40:45.791
Ahh!

40:45.833 --> 40:47.182
Argh!

40:56.889 --> 40:58.456
I-Is he dead?

41:00.065 --> 41:01.719
Come here, Billy.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.202
But I-I don't...

41:06.246 --> 41:08.335
You have to do the rest.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.998
What are they doing?

41:20.041 --> 41:22.740
I get it.

41:26.961 --> 41:28.528
No more hiding.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.498
[squishing sound]

41:42.847 --> 41:44.893
WOMAN [over P.A. system]:
Dr. Board,

41:44.936 --> 41:48.809
your meeting room
has been switched

41:48.853 --> 41:50.550
to room 1300.

41:54.293 --> 41:56.295
Hey, he's waking up.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.913
I had the strangest dream.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.871
And you were in it...

42:06.914 --> 42:09.222
And you...

42:09.264 --> 42:11.440
Who are you people?

42:12.617 --> 42:14.443
Let's get a doctor.

42:14.487 --> 42:17.273
Oh, Billy's got company.

42:17.317 --> 42:19.840
Uh, I'm his
Kiddie League coach.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.974
I come by here
every day,

42:22.016 --> 42:23.757
just hoping against hope

42:23.802 --> 42:26.065
that he's gonna wake up soon.

42:26.108 --> 42:30.025
He's, uh, my lucky 19.

42:30.068 --> 42:31.418
So, um,

42:31.460 --> 42:33.550
how is he?

42:37.076 --> 42:38.730
He's awake.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.559
What?

42:43.909 --> 42:46.041
You blamed him
for losing the game.

42:46.085 --> 42:49.175
So you caught up with him
afterwards, didn't you?

42:49.217 --> 42:50.349
What are you
talking about?

42:50.393 --> 42:51.612
BILLY:
You said it was my fault

42:51.655 --> 42:53.222
that we lost.

42:56.965 --> 42:58.445
It wasn't my fault.

42:58.487 --> 43:00.534
There's eight other players
on the team.

43:00.577 --> 43:02.449
You know that.

43:07.976 --> 43:10.326
Nice going.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.985
I just can't believe
a Kiddie League coach

43:17.028 --> 43:18.682
would do something like that.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.422
Well, you obviously
haven't played Kiddie League.

43:20.467 --> 43:22.164
I'm surprised it wasn't
one of the parents.

43:22.208 --> 43:25.907
I'm just glad he's behind bars
where he belongs.

43:25.951 --> 43:28.300
But that was
kind of heroic, Xander,

43:28.344 --> 43:29.867
grabbing him and all.

43:29.911 --> 43:31.695
Well, I just did what
anybody else would have...

43:31.739 --> 43:33.349
I mean, if you want
to label it heroic...

43:33.393 --> 43:34.612
[horn honks]
HANK:
Hi!

43:38.137 --> 43:40.181
Have a killer
weekend, guys.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.664
Hi, sweetheart.

43:44.708 --> 43:47.059
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

43:47.101 --> 43:48.364
How was your day?

43:48.407 --> 43:50.148
Oh, you know, the usual.

43:50.192 --> 43:52.193
Personal question?

43:52.237 --> 43:53.456
Yeah, shoot.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.719
When Buffy was a vampire,

43:55.762 --> 43:59.505
you weren't still, like,
attracted to her, were you?

43:59.548 --> 44:01.376
Willow, how can you...

44:01.420 --> 44:02.639
I mean, that's really bent.

44:02.682 --> 44:04.032
She was...

44:04.076 --> 44:06.077
grotesque.

44:06.121 --> 44:08.471
Still dug her, huh?

44:08.514 --> 44:10.909
I'm sick.
I need help.

44:10.952 --> 44:13.346
Don't I know it.

44:49.773 --> 44:52.253
Grr. Argh.
