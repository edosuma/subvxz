WEBVTT

00:03.021 --> 00:04.465
Okay, hold still, honey.

00:04.467 --> 00:06.522
I'm afraid you're going
to hit me again.

00:06.524 --> 00:08.312
Don't worry.
I'm just putting this time.

00:08.314 --> 00:09.799
I'm not the strongest golfer,

00:09.800 --> 00:11.976
and I think it's holding me
back in business.

00:12.226 --> 00:14.410
Too bad deals aren't closed
in a trampoline park.

00:14.411 --> 00:16.192
I'd just lazy-back
into a Rudolph

00:16.193 --> 00:19.003
into a quadriffus right up
the corporate ladder.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.376
Hey, dad, you coming
to my play tonight?

00:23.376 --> 00:25.300
"Your" play?
You only painted the sets.

00:25.302 --> 00:29.050
Yeah, and Michelangelo "only"
painted the sixteenth chapel.

00:29.201 --> 00:31.503
Maybe don't keep your face
so close to the paint cans.

00:31.504 --> 00:32.913
Sorry, buddy,
I'm getting a golf lesson

00:32.914 --> 00:33.977
and then I'm playing with a client,

00:33.977 --> 00:35.880
but I'll try to make
your next performance.

00:37.136 --> 00:38.528
- Phil!
- Little busy.

00:38.528 --> 00:39.519
Oh, you always do this.

00:39.521 --> 00:42.141
You cram stuff in the freezer
without thinking about it.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.909
I opened the door, and a frozen
turkey almost fell on my foot.

00:44.909 --> 00:46.000
I keep pulling it to the left.

00:46.001 --> 00:47.345
Are we sure the house is level?

00:47.347 --> 00:48.989
Are you not the least bit sorry?

00:48.991 --> 00:50.290
I could have broken a toe.

00:50.292 --> 00:52.167
Honey, I'm sorry
for dozens of things

00:52.168 --> 00:53.753
every day that actually happen.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.774
If I start apologizing
for things that don't happen,

00:55.775 --> 00:57.896
how productive
of a person would I be?

00:57.902 --> 00:59.821
Hey, your golf pro's here!

01:00.312 --> 01:02.463
- Hola, hola.
- Hello, everybody!

01:02.463 --> 01:03.521
Hey!

01:03.523 --> 01:05.736
Thanks so much
for the quick lesson, Jay.

01:06.136 --> 01:07.757
Just think of me as a blob of Clay,

01:07.758 --> 01:09.641
waiting for your experienced hands

01:09.643 --> 01:11.335
to caress and coax me--

01:11.335 --> 01:13.248
First rule of golf--
Shh.

01:13.248 --> 01:14.511
- Okay.
- Good.

01:14.513 --> 01:16.432
If you're going to be
a grump all day,

01:16.432 --> 01:18.263
why did you even say that
you were going to teach him?

01:18.263 --> 01:20.206
Because he's how
my grandkids get food.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.774
There he is.

01:21.775 --> 01:24.647
- Ay, thank you so much for
taking care of the baby. - Mm-hmm.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.572
Cam has me running all
kinds of errands for the play.

01:27.572 --> 01:29.806
Yeah, well, you gotta keep
your eye on the caller I.D.

01:29.807 --> 01:32.154
I have to go to the dry cleaners
to pick up the costumes...

01:32.155 --> 01:32.745
Mm-hmm.

01:32.745 --> 01:35.074
Then I have to go get
the dry ice for the fog machine.

01:35.074 --> 01:35.693
Mm-hmm.

01:35.693 --> 01:37.402
And maybe I'll go
get Cam some flowers.

01:37.404 --> 01:39.178
Oh, Alex can help you with all that.

01:39.179 --> 01:40.640
Oh, perfect.
Okay, let's go.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.892
We can't be late, or there
won't be any dry ice in the house.

01:44.385 --> 01:45.533
- Good one.
- What?

01:45.535 --> 01:47.920
You guys have fun. Go on.
Nothing to worry about.

01:47.922 --> 01:48.738
I got it handled here.

01:48.739 --> 01:49.675
Be careful.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.464
Don't worry,
just keep your mouth open.

01:53.272 --> 01:55.354
We're fine. It's fine.

02:04.219 --> 02:07.719
Synced by YYeTs, corrected by gloriabg
www.addic7ed.com

02:08.821 --> 02:11.538
Okay, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

02:11.540 --> 02:13.389
Reuben?
Hit me with a spot.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.719
That's a little harsh.
Throw a pink gel on that.

02:16.064 --> 02:17.058
That's great. Perfect.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.095
All right, I will be recording
today's rehearsal,

02:20.177 --> 02:22.356
but don't let that
make you self-conscious.

02:22.516 --> 02:24.743
I'm only using it
to pinpoint your mistakes.

02:24.868 --> 02:28.697
Secondly, I have granted full
set access to Maureen Schick,

02:28.698 --> 02:30.746
who will be reviewing
your show tonight.

02:30.748 --> 02:32.125
Oh-oh, she's vicious.

02:32.126 --> 02:34.445
Our last music teacher,
Mr. Namagachi,

02:34.447 --> 02:36.971
never recovered from her article,
"anything blows."

02:36.972 --> 02:38.720
But in fairness,
I saw that production,

02:38.720 --> 02:41.907
and the lead soprano
was an absolute disaster.

02:42.045 --> 02:43.155
No offense, Sophie.

02:43.157 --> 02:45.201
You've blossomed since then,
sweetie, okay?

02:45.201 --> 02:46.941
No batteries in her mic, okay?
Great.

02:46.943 --> 02:48.838
And lastly, Marcus Talbot.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.205
Guys, he's feeling
a little under the weather.

02:51.206 --> 02:53.530
Fear not.
He's home resting his instrument,

02:53.532 --> 02:55.539
and he will be ready
for the show tonight.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.274
But I will need a phantom
for this rehearsal.

02:57.276 --> 02:58.511
So, anyone...

02:58.511 --> 02:59.887
I guess I could help.

03:00.437 --> 03:02.296
I don't know how Marcus
ever got the lead.

03:02.396 --> 03:05.152
But I know how he got sick--
from chewing all that scenery.

03:05.599 --> 03:07.101
This was my chance to earn it back

03:07.103 --> 03:08.494
from that insincere phony.

03:08.558 --> 03:12.051
But first, a silent prayer
for our fallen Captain Marcus.

03:12.052 --> 03:14.672
Godspeed, old friend.

03:15.218 --> 03:17.567
This is boring.
Is he dead?

03:17.568 --> 03:19.843
No, he's not dead.
He's just sleeping.

03:19.980 --> 03:20.902
Babies need to sleep a lot

03:20.902 --> 03:23.485
so they grow bigger
and stronger and smarter.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.443
- Hey, Mrs. D.
- Hey, Lucy.

03:25.444 --> 03:27.687
- Every time.
- Mm.

03:27.687 --> 03:29.009
Well, that's a nice shirt.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.734
Thanks. I designed it myself.

03:30.735 --> 03:32.015
It's my best seller.

03:32.016 --> 03:34.372
I'm so jealous you know what
you want to do with your life.

03:34.373 --> 03:36.370
I wish I was inspired like you.

03:36.459 --> 03:39.021
Or, you know, aim higher.

03:39.234 --> 03:40.799
Open yourself up
to some new experiences

03:40.800 --> 03:41.852
and find out what--

03:42.270 --> 03:43.858
- Oh, my g--
- Are you okay?

03:43.859 --> 03:46.897
Fine. Just... slipped on one of
your father's stupid golf balls.

03:46.899 --> 03:48.656
Good, you woke him up.

03:48.657 --> 03:50.223
Maybe he's hungry.
I just fed him,

03:50.224 --> 03:52.330
but I don't think bottles
can live up to the real thing.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.120
Maybe I can calm him down.

03:54.121 --> 03:56.626
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
but he's super fussy today.

03:56.626 --> 03:58.652
And when babies are fussy,
they--they...

03:59.691 --> 04:02.686
- Wow.
- Yeah, I'm good with babies.

04:02.686 --> 04:05.355
You should see him play
peek-a-boo. He's amazing.

04:05.357 --> 04:06.787
No. I'm good.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.786
I know a guy in Chicago--
he's amazing.

04:12.519 --> 04:13.835
Dang it!

04:13.835 --> 04:16.744
Are you kiddin' me? That divot
flew out of there like a rocket.

04:17.327 --> 04:19.476
I decided to go gentle with Phil,

04:19.500 --> 04:20.606
which didn't come easy to me,

04:20.606 --> 04:22.216
because I've always been
a bit of a drill sergeant

04:22.216 --> 04:23.647
when it comes to sports.

04:24.379 --> 04:25.276
And with the new baby,

04:25.276 --> 04:26.904
Gloria's been buggin' me
to have more patience.

04:26.904 --> 04:28.622
But come on.
He's been alive a month.

04:28.719 --> 04:30.839
How hard is it to support
your own head?

04:32.442 --> 04:33.951
What the hell?

04:34.844 --> 04:35.956
Hello, boys.

04:35.957 --> 04:37.762
What a sweet ride, Pepper.

04:37.764 --> 04:38.971
What are you guys doing here?

04:38.973 --> 04:41.076
I've been golfing for a few weeks.

04:41.076 --> 04:42.343
Pepper's been teaching me.

04:42.442 --> 04:44.393
I grew up golfing with my father,

04:44.393 --> 04:46.681
the great Chaim Saltzman.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.354
Or as he was known
around the clubhouse,

04:48.355 --> 04:49.389
Chad Treadwell.

04:49.391 --> 04:51.442
Well, we should play together
as a foursome.

04:51.444 --> 04:53.561
First time that word's
creeped me out, but okay.

04:53.562 --> 04:54.692
Care to make it interesting?

04:54.694 --> 04:56.008
I think your pants
have already done that.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.292
How 'bout a hundred bucks?

04:57.292 --> 04:58.682
Me and Phil will play you and Mitch.

04:58.684 --> 05:00.420
- Fun.
- Mitchell, care to go first?

05:00.420 --> 05:01.554
Oh, I...

05:01.650 --> 05:03.577
Okay. Yeah.
I'll-- I'll give it a whirl.

05:03.577 --> 05:06.041
Running into my dad was no accident.

05:06.043 --> 05:08.012
I wasn't the best athlete
growing up,

05:08.012 --> 05:09.909
and my dad never missed
an opportunity

05:09.911 --> 05:11.147
to point that out.

05:11.197 --> 05:12.810
"Nice throw, Nancy!"

05:14.459 --> 05:15.298
Nancy was our neighbor.

05:15.299 --> 05:16.947
I could never throw
as well as she could.

05:17.188 --> 05:19.685
I'd pretty much given up
on beating my dad at anything

05:19.685 --> 05:22.010
until Pepper dragged me
to a golf course one day.

05:22.010 --> 05:24.774
Turns out I wasn't half bad.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.426
Six months' practice later,

05:26.426 --> 05:28.374
I was ready to kick my dad's ass.

05:28.374 --> 05:30.341
I knew just how
I was gonna do it, too.

05:30.759 --> 05:33.420
I'd walk up to the tee all nervous,

05:33.422 --> 05:35.821
do a few clumsy practice swings,

05:36.076 --> 05:38.254
and then I'd hit
that ball dead center,

05:38.254 --> 05:40.857
watch it arc through the sky,
land on the green,

05:40.951 --> 05:42.845
and totally wow my dad.

05:47.382 --> 05:48.427
Wow.

Luke. I was just about to ask him.

07:05.916 --> 07:08.846
- Luke? - He knows the show,
he sings like a nightingale,

07:08.848 --> 07:11.171
and he has a certain theatrical
madness in his eyes

07:11.173 --> 07:12.079
you cannot teach.

Are you trying to spook him?

07:15.904 --> 07:16.878
What are you talking about?

07:16.880 --> 07:18.260
He's already intimidated by you

07:18.260 --> 07:19.644
after you criticized his sets.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.452
Oh, please.
I could not be the only person

07:21.454 --> 07:23.060

07:31.698 --> 07:32.809
Yeah. Just do it.

07:33.605 --> 07:36.391
Hey there, Luke.
Or should I say, phantom?

07:36.513 --> 07:37.302
You wanna get to the point?

07:37.302 --> 07:38.876
'Cause I'm kind of on a schedule,

07:38.877 --> 07:40.744

08:24.891 --> 08:26.889
that somebody could be so oblivious

08:26.889 --> 08:29.257
to a situation that
is clearly dangerous.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.009
Look at us.
We're like a little family.

08:32.009 --> 08:33.269
I know.

08:33.326 --> 08:35.640
- We're the parents.
- I know!

08:35.642 --> 08:38.015
I know what his
response would be--

08:38.017 --> 08:40.461
"but you're fine.
Why you getting all bent out of shape?"

08:40.461 --> 08:42.081
But what if I wasn't fine?

08:42.326 --> 08:43.215
What if he walked through the door,

08:43.216 --> 08:46.325
and he thought he had
created a horrible accident?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.056
Oh, this is so fun.

08:48.869 --> 08:50.310
Good. She's gone.

08:50.311 --> 08:51.327
Grab your camera.

08:51.329 --> 08:53.551
I'm gonna make his little hand
flip us off again.

08:55.325 --> 08:56.551
No, it's not just me.

08:56.552 --> 08:58.007
Three mothers are giving the party,

08:58.008 --> 09:00.009
and we need all
our names in the card--

09:00.010 --> 09:03.808
Gloria Pritchett,
Sara Leonard, Dee Cho...

09:04.028 --> 09:05.344
What do you mean that
there's no more room?

09:05.344 --> 09:06.866
Dee Cho must go on.

09:06.983 --> 09:08.881
Okay, come on.
That one had to be on purpose.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.790
Okay, we'll be there then.

09:11.482 --> 09:14.180
They won't be ready
until one more hour.

09:14.459 --> 09:16.536
You maybe wanna take
a shift carrying this dry ice?

09:16.536 --> 09:17.992
No, I just had a baby.

09:17.993 --> 09:20.003
I've watched you carry
Manny to bed.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.730
I know what we can do to kill time.

09:21.732 --> 09:23.828
My psychic is around the corner.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.809
Please tell me
you just said "sidekick."

09:26.103 --> 09:28.967
I used to think that
I knew everything, too.

09:29.008 --> 09:30.053
We're going for a reading.

09:30.054 --> 09:31.731
I'll let her know that we're coming.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.017
Um...

09:34.019 --> 09:35.835
You have got to be kidding me.

09:36.064 --> 09:38.466
I'm trying to remember
the telephone number.

09:40.237 --> 09:41.799
What is happening to me?

09:42.083 --> 09:43.972
All right, what are we,
3 strokes down now?

09:44.607 --> 09:46.745
I think someone needs a Pepper talk.

09:47.692 --> 09:49.256
Aah! Ow!

09:49.617 --> 09:50.963
How is that a pepper talk?

09:50.963 --> 09:53.045
You need to get angry.
Play aggressive.

09:53.073 --> 09:55.548
That man's been Mitch-slapping
you your entire life.

09:55.549 --> 09:58.631
I know, but...
he's being so nice to Phil,

09:58.632 --> 10:00.881
and Phil is way worse
than I ever was.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.313
I don't know.

10:02.771 --> 10:05.250
Maybe he's not the
unsympathetic jerk he used to be.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.866
Okay, so you got off
to a rough start.

10:08.127 --> 10:09.178
Let's simplify.

10:09.179 --> 10:12.121
On this shot, I want you
to just concentrate

10:12.122 --> 10:13.822
on bending your knees.

10:13.823 --> 10:16.362
- You got it?
- Bend my knees.

10:16.446 --> 10:17.168
Bend my--

10:17.169 --> 10:18.831
Dang it!
Straighten my knees.

10:18.831 --> 10:20.817
Son of a bitch,
you're a hopeless embarrassment.

10:20.818 --> 10:23.615
You're kickin' up more sand
than a sea turtle layin' eggs.

10:26.344 --> 10:27.783
Did you see that?!

10:27.870 --> 10:29.279
Yeah, that wasn't half bad.

10:30.201 --> 10:31.532
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I yelled.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.647
No, no, no.
That's what I needed.

10:32.648 --> 10:33.730
My old tumbling master in college

10:33.731 --> 10:36.025
used to yell at me all the time.
It just made me better.

10:36.027 --> 10:36.906
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

10:36.907 --> 10:38.659
He'd say terrible things
about my manhood,

10:38.660 --> 10:40.038
he'd throw the chalk bag at me,

10:40.038 --> 10:42.249
he'd call me and taunt me over
the summer to keep me sharp.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.594
So bring it, Jay!

10:44.046 --> 10:45.130
You stink, Phil.

10:45.132 --> 10:46.633
You're the worst thing
to happen to golf

10:46.633 --> 10:48.239
since they let people wear shorts.

10:49.372 --> 10:50.242
You just told me to--

10:50.243 --> 10:51.734
No, that's part of it.

10:53.314 --> 10:54.643
Did you hear that?

10:54.657 --> 10:56.119
And he wasn't just talking to Phil.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.442
He was talking to 10-year-old you

10:57.444 --> 10:58.955
and 12-year-old you and...

10:59.340 --> 11:01.502
Suck it, Nancy!

11:02.051 --> 11:03.960
I was just trying to help.

11:04.378 --> 11:06.881
Just listen with an open mind.

11:07.451 --> 11:09.222
She doesn't believe in psychics.

11:09.223 --> 11:10.488
It's not just psychics.

11:10.489 --> 11:12.624
It's all unquantifiable phenomena.

11:12.847 --> 11:14.410
I'm going to save you some time.

11:14.422 --> 11:16.323
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

11:16.324 --> 11:17.938
Maybe not now, but soon.

11:18.546 --> 11:19.142
You see?

11:19.143 --> 11:20.430
- That means--
- Shh. Go on.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.015
You are going to meet
someone special.

11:23.496 --> 11:25.892
I see a handsome man on a horse,

11:25.892 --> 11:27.622
like a knight.

11:27.622 --> 11:30.399
Well, I am going to
a renaissance fair this weekend.

11:30.492 --> 11:31.708
Yes, I know.

11:31.827 --> 11:33.121
There's no renaissance fair.

11:33.122 --> 11:34.942
Even if there was, I wouldn't go.

11:34.943 --> 11:37.860
I'd be the laughingstock
of the young astronomer's club.

11:38.237 --> 11:41.269
But I couldn't tell Gloria
her fortune-teller was a fake...

11:41.612 --> 11:43.171
Not until I had a little more fun.

11:43.432 --> 11:46.717
I see that you're smiling.
You're enjoying yourself.

11:46.861 --> 11:47.794
I know it sounds crazy,

11:47.795 --> 11:49.045
but could you please
tell me what happened to

11:49.046 --> 11:51.391
my bunny buttons,
who ran away when I was 5?

11:51.455 --> 11:53.701
Never had a bunny.
Hate bunnies.

11:53.702 --> 11:55.443
- I see a farm...
- Mm-hmm?

11:55.444 --> 11:56.769
With a red barn.

11:56.770 --> 11:57.783
I know who's in the barn!

11:58.004 --> 11:59.746
It's like Scrabble with Haley.

11:59.823 --> 12:02.741
After a while, you're just
playing against yourself.

12:03.179 --> 12:04.990
Okay, everyone,
look sharp, please!

12:04.991 --> 12:06.097
The press is here!

12:06.145 --> 12:08.401
As I was saying, Maureen,
I was really at an advantage

12:08.403 --> 12:09.776
having seen the Broadway production.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.875
I was able to learn
from their mistakes.

12:11.876 --> 12:13.145
For example, in my production,

12:13.146 --> 12:14.697
the phantom appears
in the first scene,

12:14.697 --> 12:16.119
because after all,
it's not called

12:16.120 --> 12:17.761
"Christine and Raoul
of the opera."

12:17.763 --> 12:18.943
I have two sources telling me

12:18.945 --> 12:20.239
your lead is home with chicken pox.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.981
- Uh, mono.
- Make that three sources.

12:21.983 --> 12:22.978
Oh, damn, you're good.

12:22.979 --> 12:25.480
Um, permission to speak...
off the record?

12:25.480 --> 12:26.281
Denied.

12:26.282 --> 12:27.816
Okay, fine.
Well, then...

12:28.456 --> 12:29.635
See for yourself in just a moment.

12:29.637 --> 12:30.882
Tonight a star will be born.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.014
- Cam? - Not now, Manny.
I'm birthing something.

12:33.647 --> 12:34.701
Sometimes in the theater,

12:34.702 --> 12:37.471
the real drama happens
before the curtain rises.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.779
Observe.

12:40.620 --> 12:41.759
Luke Dunphy,

12:42.078 --> 12:43.744
how would you like
to play the starring role

12:43.745 --> 12:46.141
in Cameron Tucker's
Andrew Lloyd Webber's

12:46.142 --> 12:47.725
"Phantom of the opera"?

12:47.791 --> 12:48.779
Nope.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.791
Luke Dunphy,
is it true you passed

12:50.791 --> 12:53.345
because of creative differences
with an overbearing director?

12:53.346 --> 12:54.831
Say nothing to that jackal!

12:54.987 --> 12:55.987
Manny, what happened?

12:55.988 --> 12:56.966
I tried my best.

12:56.968 --> 12:59.312
He started hyperventilating
just thinking about it.

12:59.314 --> 13:01.836
I guess some people just aren't
comfortable taking center stage.

13:01.838 --> 13:03.561
Okay. Well, maybe
we can pump Marcus

13:03.561 --> 13:05.559
full of whatever they
gave those bike riders.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.041
He's too sick. But don't worry, Cam,
you'll think of something.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.193
It's always darkest
right before the...

13:10.194 --> 13:12.229
Reuben, could you keep
that thing still?!

13:12.231 --> 13:13.795
Okay, well, I guess
we only have one option.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.108
- I'll do it.
- Hmm?

13:16.186 --> 13:18.147
I was gonna say
play the role myself,

13:18.149 --> 13:21.087
but, you know, I guess
it really should be about the kids.

13:21.439 --> 13:24.805
Now if I had tripped
on your father's golf ball,

13:24.805 --> 13:26.474
say... top of the stairs,

13:26.476 --> 13:28.526
probably would have-- oh, no!

13:28.526 --> 13:29.713
Taken out some pictures.

13:29.713 --> 13:30.967
Look what you've done, Phil!

13:30.967 --> 13:31.971
Mom!

13:31.972 --> 13:34.030
It's okay. It's finally sleeping.

13:34.031 --> 13:36.313
Hey, we should take
a picture of all of us.

13:36.314 --> 13:39.107
Then once you get going,
you know, you just can't stop.

13:39.108 --> 13:41.098
You're taking
everything down with you.

13:41.498 --> 13:42.523
Oh!

13:42.875 --> 13:44.770
And then, to make it perfectly clear

13:44.771 --> 13:46.299
to your father what happened,

13:46.401 --> 13:47.453
I'll put the golf ball right here,

13:47.454 --> 13:49.062
because some people
can't see the danger

13:49.063 --> 13:50.877
unless it's right
under their nose.

13:52.334 --> 13:54.069
Having kids is fun.

13:54.256 --> 13:55.655
And easy.

13:55.692 --> 13:57.981
Maybe this is what
I should do with my life.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.149
Oh.

14:03.239 --> 14:06.484
Oh, he's such a little angel.
I want one.

14:06.485 --> 14:09.380
Shh. Haley, little dude
needs his sleep.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.986
I wanted to tell Haley
about the dangers

14:10.986 --> 14:12.872
of starting a family too early,

14:12.919 --> 14:14.472
but what could I say

14:14.474 --> 14:17.961
that couldn't be said better
by a screaming baby?

14:19.245 --> 14:20.283
Mom!

14:20.284 --> 14:21.638
Oh, sorry.

14:21.638 --> 14:24.380
I don't know what's wrong
with me today.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.353
- Mom!
- Still good.

14:26.354 --> 14:28.339
- Sorry.
- Would you just get out of here?

14:28.340 --> 14:30.244
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Totally sorry.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.294
It's my--

14:31.773 --> 14:32.755
Sorry.

14:34.219 --> 14:36.930
When he wakes up,
we should all go out for ice cream.

14:37.115 --> 14:39.050
I was thinking the same thing.

14:42.004 --> 14:43.164
What are you doing?

14:43.166 --> 14:44.920
Minding my own business.

14:45.013 --> 14:48.045
Wait. Ice cream
might ruin Lily's dinner.

14:48.136 --> 14:49.197
So?

14:49.258 --> 14:51.397
So I spent all afternoon cooking.

14:51.397 --> 14:52.895
I thought ice cream would be fun.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.377
All you've done today is have fun
while I did all the work.

14:55.378 --> 14:57.564
I'm just trying to make
the most of it with these kids.

14:57.565 --> 14:59.777
I don't have as much time
with them as you do.

14:59.778 --> 15:01.604
What, by spoiling them?

15:02.352 --> 15:04.181
Who's that? Who's texting you?

15:04.181 --> 15:05.365
It's just about work.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.633
Typical. Even when you're here,
you're not here.

15:07.752 --> 15:10.232
Why are you this upset
about ice cream?

15:10.233 --> 15:11.351
If that's what you think
this is about,

15:11.352 --> 15:13.188
then you haven't heard
a word I've said!

15:13.189 --> 15:15.715
I-I'm confused.
Why do we even have these kids?

15:15.717 --> 15:16.776
I don't know!

15:17.448 --> 15:18.435
I'm going home!

15:18.436 --> 15:19.457
Good!

15:23.674 --> 15:26.123
Oh, fantastic.

15:27.222 --> 15:29.304
One stroke down on the final hole.

15:29.305 --> 15:32.548
It's such a big putt.
Such a big, big putt.

15:32.813 --> 15:35.252
I like big putts,
and I cannot lie.

15:35.254 --> 15:36.230
Money.

15:36.231 --> 15:38.813
You know what'll be sad?
You doing all that practicing

15:38.814 --> 15:40.857
to finally be able
to beat your old man,

15:40.857 --> 15:42.280
and coming up just short.

15:42.353 --> 15:43.613
I almost...

15:44.007 --> 15:45.169
can't watch.

15:45.625 --> 15:46.784
Yeah!

15:47.534 --> 15:48.826
You're up, ace.

15:51.256 --> 15:52.221
Ohh!

15:52.350 --> 15:54.324
I was the same way with my father.

15:54.448 --> 15:55.889
It's always complicated.

15:55.994 --> 15:57.803
Not for mine.
My dad was just supportive.

15:57.803 --> 16:00.346
Never missed a tumbling meet
or a break-dance brawl.

16:00.399 --> 16:02.836
Heck, I'd set up the sound system
for our school assembly,

16:02.836 --> 16:04.606
he'd be the loudest
voice in the crowd.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.112
"Hey, everybody!
Check out my son's equipment!"

16:08.169 --> 16:09.479
- Aw.
- Yeah.

16:09.561 --> 16:10.955
Hey, seriously, good luck.

16:11.022 --> 16:12.498
You played good.
I'm proud of you.

16:12.499 --> 16:15.120
- Really?
- We should do this again sometime.

16:15.121 --> 16:17.299
Don't listen to him.
He's "Cat's in the cradling" you.

16:17.301 --> 16:20.172
- What? - He's playing on your
emotions so you lose your edge.

16:20.172 --> 16:21.815
I do it to my son all the time.

16:21.816 --> 16:22.745
Did he say "son"?

16:22.747 --> 16:24.729
Yes. He's a Navy S.E.A.L.

16:25.105 --> 16:26.620
Oh, I've said too much.

16:26.622 --> 16:27.798
What's "Cats in the cradle"?

16:27.800 --> 16:29.259
You know, that song
about the dad who misses

16:29.260 --> 16:30.995
all the important moments
in his kid's life?

16:30.997 --> 16:32.258
Stay strong,

16:32.312 --> 16:34.093
just like Kyle did in Yemen.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.656
Oh, my God, I'm a sieve.

16:36.697 --> 16:38.827
All right, Mitch. Showtime.

16:38.951 --> 16:40.301
Five. Six.

16:40.302 --> 16:42.326
A-five, six, seven, eight.

16:43.055 --> 16:45.369
- Ah ha ha!
- Yes!

16:45.371 --> 16:46.969
A hundred bucks!

16:46.969 --> 16:48.181
Oh, we did it!

16:48.182 --> 16:51.483
Now I can afford the shirt
that matches these pants.

16:52.071 --> 16:53.578
So... drinks in the clubhouse?

16:53.579 --> 16:55.037
Can't. My kid's in a play.

16:55.038 --> 16:57.022
Yeah, I'm meeting a client
for another round of golf.

16:57.023 --> 16:59.465
Hey, if you see Luke,
will you give him a hug for me?

16:59.467 --> 17:00.847
Will do.
Hey, I was serious

17:00.848 --> 17:02.086
about we should
play again sometime.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.464
It's a crazy thing

17:03.465 --> 17:05.573
that if I'd been less of a hard head
when you were a kid,

17:05.574 --> 17:07.169
we could have had 20 years
in this dumb game.

17:07.170 --> 17:08.625
No, it was half my fault.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.891
I mean, I-I used to be
pretty sensitive.

17:11.659 --> 17:12.751
So y-you really weren't

17:12.752 --> 17:14.113
"Cat's in the cradling"
me back there?

17:14.114 --> 17:14.959
Of course not.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.185
How have I not heard of this song
you keep talking about?

17:17.186 --> 17:19.278
- You have. It's the worst.
- It's the schmaltziest.

17:19.279 --> 17:19.958
Unbearable.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.801
I'll play it on the way back.
I have it on my iPod phone.

17:39.698 --> 17:41.594
I should have golfed
with you sooner, dad.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.119
I never made the time.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.555
Luke!

17:45.082 --> 17:46.784
I need to call my son.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.928
What time is it in Damascus?

17:49.061 --> 17:52.081
Ugh. Why don't I just
draw them a map?

17:52.127 --> 17:53.118
Ready to play, Phil?

17:53.119 --> 17:55.676
I can't, Carl!
My boy's sets are in a play!

17:57.964 --> 18:00.341
I get the feeling
that something wonderful

18:00.342 --> 18:01.824
has happened to someone you know.

18:01.825 --> 18:03.226
Yes, it's Manny.

18:03.226 --> 18:05.627
He got the lead role
in the school play.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.337
Yes, that's it.

18:07.429 --> 18:09.574
Okay, I think you might have met
her halfway on that one.

18:09.645 --> 18:11.398
Do you feel that?

18:11.447 --> 18:13.733
A presence has just
entered the room.

18:13.734 --> 18:15.023
Or the A.C. kicked in.

18:15.024 --> 18:16.809
Gloria, I have to say something.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.210
It's your abuela.

18:19.124 --> 18:20.039
Which one?

18:20.102 --> 18:22.557
Is she smoking a pipe,
or is she smoking a cigar?

18:22.558 --> 18:23.500
A cigar.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.889
- My mother's mother.
- Mm.

18:25.890 --> 18:27.317
I miss her so much.

18:27.318 --> 18:29.093
She says she misses you, too.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.313
I wish that she was here
now to see Fulgencio Joe.

18:32.369 --> 18:33.855
She has seen him,

18:34.126 --> 18:36.654
and she says he is beautiful.

18:36.655 --> 18:38.334
He is, isn't he?

18:38.396 --> 18:40.747
Ay. Tell her that I love her.

18:40.748 --> 18:42.136
She knows.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.682
- Thank you so much for that.
- Mm.

18:46.153 --> 18:47.602

18:59.042 --> 19:00.302
or just choose to ignore them?

19:00.303 --> 19:01.223
Where are you going with that?

19:01.224 --> 19:02.412
We need an extra one up front.

19:02.413 --> 19:03.829
Mr. Namagachi decided to come.

19:03.829 --> 19:05.520
Oh, you mean the disgraced
teacher I replaced

19:05.521 --> 19:07.270
suddenly has an interest
in this production?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.657
He's parking his Peugeot right now.

19:08.658 --> 19:11.101
Wow, the vultures
are officially circling.

19:11.103 --> 19:13.127
Okay, Manny, it's no secret

19:13.128 --> 19:14.856
that you were not
my first choice for this,

19:14.857 --> 19:15.934
or my second.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.711
But it's not too late for you

19:17.712 --> 19:19.174

19:33.469 --> 19:35.202
But my quarrel wasn't with Luke.

19:35.639 --> 19:36.794
It was with God.

19:38.279 --> 19:39.877
Save a seat for your sister.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.821
Excuse me.
I think that's my seat.

19:46.186 --> 19:46.820

I'm gonna be straight
with you, Carl.

20:50.474 --> 20:51.970
You got a ton of inventory to move,
