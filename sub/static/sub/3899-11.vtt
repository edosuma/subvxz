[Fig moaning]

01:10.451 --> 01:11.702
Ah!

01:11.785 --> 01:12.912
Say it.

01:12.995 --> 01:14.288
Say it!

01:14.371 --> 01:17.249
You're the man.
Oh, you're the man!

01:17.333 --> 01:18.584
[grunting]

01:19.877 --> 01:22.296
[Caputo moaning] Oh, my God.

[both moan]

01:25.883 --> 01:27.176
[sighs]

01:31.973 --> 01:33.765
- Ew.
- Gross.

01:40.940 --> 01:43.025
Your place depresses me.

01:44.318 --> 01:47.989
The walls are sticky with loneliness.

01:48.072 --> 01:49.115
[sighs]

01:49.198 --> 01:53.285
I'm disgusted with myself... every time.

01:54.578 --> 01:56.247
Why am I fucking you?

01:56.330 --> 02:00.209
You fancy yourself a nice guy, Joe...

02:00.292 --> 02:02.211
but you're not.

02:02.294 --> 02:05.089
You're a deeply angry and resentful man...

02:06.423 --> 02:10.636
because the world hasn't appreciated you
the way you think you deserve.

02:10.719 --> 02:14.640
And right now, there's no one
you resent more than me.

02:14.723 --> 02:16.433
So in fucking me,

02:16.517 --> 02:20.229
you get a small leak in that
overinflated resentment balloon...

02:21.230 --> 02:22.481
and it gives you some relief.

02:23.649 --> 02:25.192
I've given this some thought.

02:28.029 --> 02:29.696
Feels good, doesn't it?

02:31.032 --> 02:33.492
See you next Tuesday.

02:33.575 --> 02:35.411
See you next Tuesday.

02:38.205 --> 02:39.706
I see what you did there.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.503
The NFFE said they can't help us
now that we're private.

02:44.586 --> 02:47.173
And a lot of the big unions
won't rep security workers.

02:47.256 --> 02:49.091
So what's our option?

02:49.175 --> 02:50.759
- We form our own.
- Just us?

02:50.842 --> 02:53.179
That's the lamest union ever.
We'll have no power.

02:53.262 --> 02:54.513
Got no power now.

02:54.596 --> 02:55.973
This one time in middle school,

02:56.057 --> 02:58.434
I staged a walkout, all right,
to get more pizza days.

02:58.517 --> 03:00.644
Got suspended for two days.

03:00.727 --> 03:03.397
The squeaky mouse is cat food, all right?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.024
- [door opening]
- Just saying.

03:09.611 --> 03:11.155
What the fuck is going on here?

03:11.238 --> 03:13.407
We're unionizing.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.659
That's the boss, dummy.

03:15.742 --> 03:17.369
It's Caputo.
He's one of us.

03:17.995 --> 03:21.415
Our new private overlords
nixed our union memberships.

03:21.498 --> 03:24.543
Fine print in the startup paperwork.
Sneaky bastards.

03:24.626 --> 03:28.464
Same size as the rest of the print.
Clearly stated.

03:28.547 --> 03:29.548
You knew about this?

03:29.631 --> 03:32.218
Yeah...
because unlike the rest of you,

03:32.301 --> 03:34.929
I actually read something
before I sign it.

03:35.012 --> 03:38.182
How about you count your blessings
that you all got rehired?

03:38.265 --> 03:41.727
Could be bagging groceries
down at the Stop and Shop.

03:41.810 --> 03:44.813
I am bagging groceries
at the Stop and Shop.

03:44.896 --> 03:46.523
Every weekend.

03:46.607 --> 03:48.775
Yeah, I work security at Riverside Mall.

03:48.859 --> 03:52.279
This troll manager at Best Buy
says I'm lacking people skills.

03:52.363 --> 03:54.781
But really, I think he's just
threatened by my height.

03:54.865 --> 03:55.992
Okay...

03:56.908 --> 03:57.952
I get it.

03:58.035 --> 04:00.246
I get that this is a financial strain.

04:00.329 --> 04:03.207
Listen, guys, we're six weeks in.

04:03.290 --> 04:08.295
You gotta prove that you're valuable
before you can start demanding shit.

04:08.379 --> 04:09.463
They've turned you.

04:09.546 --> 04:12.049
- Corporate wonk.
- Pod person.

04:13.134 --> 04:15.177
Okay, Norma Rae, out of my way.

04:15.261 --> 04:17.178
I need a goddamn cup of coffee.

04:19.055 --> 04:21.017
These are work hours.

04:21.100 --> 04:24.311
Rabble-rouse on your own time.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.855
Let's go!
Come on!

04:32.403 --> 04:33.945
[crowd cheering]

04:35.906 --> 04:41.745
[announcer] And the 175-pound weight class
goes to the Richmond Wolverines!

04:41.828 --> 04:44.040
[man] Yeah, Wolverines!

04:45.582 --> 04:49.711
A hero is not just a guy
who runs into burning buildings.

04:49.795 --> 04:51.463
It's also a person who shows us

04:51.547 --> 04:54.216
what it means to be
a decent human being.

04:54.300 --> 04:57.011
Now, none of yous agreed to wrestle
that kid from Central today.

04:57.094 --> 05:00.847
Kendall, uh... something.
I get it.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.267
It's embarrassing to grapple with...

05:04.726 --> 05:08.314
The coach tells me
his one dream in life is to wrestle.

05:08.397 --> 05:09.898
And who stepped up?

05:09.981 --> 05:12.943
Our number-one seed,
Joey Caputo.

05:13.027 --> 05:16.822
He didn't have to.
Joey's got nothing to prove.

05:16.905 --> 05:18.615
But he still volunteered.

05:18.699 --> 05:20.742
Now that is a hero.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.789
Look at that kid.

05:27.541 --> 05:28.917
Look how happy he is.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.712
Hey, special kids got feelings too, right?

05:31.795 --> 05:34.465
I'm gonna let him feel like
he's really doing it.

05:36.175 --> 05:37.509
You're a good man, Joey.

05:37.593 --> 05:40.596
[announcer] And next up,
we have an exhibition match

05:40.679 --> 05:43.599
between two very special wrestlers.

05:43.682 --> 05:46.893
Joseph Salvatore Caputo
and Kendall Barnes.

05:46.977 --> 05:48.520
Let's give a big round of applause!

05:48.604 --> 05:51.732
- I'm a champion! I'm a champion!
- [all cheering]

05:53.066 --> 05:54.276
Yeah, Joey!

05:56.237 --> 05:57.363
You're amazing.

05:57.446 --> 05:59.198
No, he is.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.039
All right, go easy on me, buddy.

06:08.124 --> 06:09.125
No way.

06:13.129 --> 06:15.714
- [man] Show 'em what you got, Kendall!
- [whistle blowing]

06:16.173 --> 06:17.383
Huh?

06:17.883 --> 06:19.135
- [grunts]
- [crowd gasps]

06:19.218 --> 06:21.178
- [groaning]
- [whistle blowing]

06:21.262 --> 06:22.638
I'm a champion!
I'm a champion!

06:22.721 --> 06:25.849
Fuck.
There goes States.

06:29.145 --> 06:31.355
Here you go.
It's for all of us.

06:31.438 --> 06:32.814
Great, thanks.

06:53.210 --> 06:56.838
[woman on PA] You must stand
at count under Code 320.

06:56.922 --> 06:58.632
Hey, Space Admiral.

07:03.053 --> 07:04.638
Double shocker.

07:05.806 --> 07:07.098
Back in your bunks.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.518
[inmates snickering]

07:10.602 --> 07:12.396
- Rice?
- Yeah?

07:12.479 --> 07:14.064
Sara Rice?

07:14.148 --> 07:16.650
I got your pack-out clothes
and your release paperwork.

07:18.109 --> 07:20.654
What are you waiting for?
You want out or not? Get moving.

07:23.657 --> 07:25.075
[Leanne] Who do they think you are?

07:25.159 --> 07:26.868
Someone with my same last name.

07:26.952 --> 07:29.120
See, it's her name with my ID number.

07:29.205 --> 07:31.332
That new guard don't know anybody.
She thinks it's me.

07:31.415 --> 07:33.750
[laughing] Holy shit, this is a miracle!

07:33.834 --> 07:35.169
Praise Norma!

07:35.252 --> 07:36.712
Is she maxing out?

07:36.795 --> 07:39.089
Yup, Sara Rice is outta here.
No strings.

07:39.173 --> 07:40.632
Free Rice.

07:40.716 --> 07:42.426
I'm starting to feel bad.

07:42.509 --> 07:43.927
Fuck that bitch.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.180
You really think they'll let me out?

07:47.598 --> 07:50.392
There's only one way to know.
You gotta try.

07:52.060 --> 07:56.232
If they let me go,
then I'm gone.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.951
[both laughing]

08:08.827 --> 08:10.078
Hmm.

08:11.372 --> 08:12.956
Oh, Lordy.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.292
What's that?

08:15.376 --> 08:17.294
Nothing.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.214
You know, I never thought about it,

08:20.297 --> 08:23.384
but you and the Admiral
share some definite similarities.

08:23.467 --> 08:27.471
What's this whole Admiral thing?
Why does everyone keep calling me that?

08:27.554 --> 08:28.764
Give me that.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.643
- Give me that.
- Don't lose my place... all right?

08:32.726 --> 08:34.436
This is fucking crazy.

08:38.399 --> 08:39.732
Oh, God, not again!

08:39.816 --> 08:41.067
I'm not gonna hurt you.

08:41.150 --> 08:44.154
You just stay right there.

08:44.238 --> 08:47.073
Okay, I'm not moving.
Listen...

08:47.157 --> 08:48.534
[sighs]

08:48.617 --> 08:51.995
I just...
I just wanna say that I'm sorry.

08:53.163 --> 08:57.167
Okay? I feel bad.
I did not mean to hit you.

08:57.251 --> 08:59.253
Oh, it kind of felt like you did.

09:02.213 --> 09:03.632
Are you gonna dime on me?

09:04.841 --> 09:07.344
I mean, I know you don't
have a whole lot of reason not to.

09:07.428 --> 09:11.973
But... I was hoping that you could see
that my apology is sincere.

09:12.808 --> 09:16.645
Let me make it up to you personally
and not end up in Seg or down the hill.

09:16.728 --> 09:20.399
Is this some kind of enhanced
interrogation technique?

09:21.567 --> 09:22.734
Who sent you?

09:26.154 --> 09:27.406
[sighs]

09:28.574 --> 09:29.825
Okay.

09:37.082 --> 09:38.750
I'm gonna come clean.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.213
I'm not NSA.

09:43.297 --> 09:44.381
I'm CIA.

09:44.465 --> 09:46.633
- Oh, you expect me to believe that?
- [shushing]

09:46.717 --> 09:48.510
It's complicated.

09:48.594 --> 09:49.678
May I?

09:51.763 --> 09:53.181
What they don't know is...

09:53.264 --> 09:56.059
And by "they,"
I mean, you know, "they,"

09:56.142 --> 09:58.228
like, the real "they..."

09:58.312 --> 10:00.314
is that I'm actually a double agent.

10:00.397 --> 10:01.440
And they don't know?

10:01.523 --> 10:05.569
That is why I had to beat you up,
to throw them off-track.

10:05.652 --> 10:08.447
If they find out we're working together,
they'll take me out.

10:08.530 --> 10:13.034
Oh, and if they get to you,
they can redouble you.

10:13.118 --> 10:14.411
Turn you back.

10:15.371 --> 10:16.955
- Exactly.
- Oh!

10:18.081 --> 10:21.209
That is why we can't
call attention to our little incident.

10:22.252 --> 10:23.837
There's a lot at stake here.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.549
I need your silence
so that we can continue the work.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.259
- Yeah, man.
- [footsteps approaching]

10:29.343 --> 10:32.638
[loudly] And thank you
for getting me that Vagisil.

10:33.514 --> 10:35.641
'Cause this was just so itchy.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.393
Thank you.

10:37.476 --> 10:38.560
Hey...

10:38.644 --> 10:40.771
[whispering] now you gotta really
get me the Vagisil.

10:40.854 --> 10:44.691
You know, like, so we can...
You know, just to cover up, 'cause...

10:44.775 --> 10:46.151
On it.

10:46.777 --> 10:49.446
Yo, where are my donuts?

10:51.239 --> 10:52.908
- Not today.
- [scoffs]

10:52.991 --> 10:56.912
Girl, did I not tell you to suck a dick
and get me some goodies?

10:56.995 --> 10:58.955
Chop-chop, little lady.

11:00.331 --> 11:02.333
Hey...

11:02.418 --> 11:04.210
what's the matter with you?

11:04.294 --> 11:05.837
Nothing, my stomach just hurts today.

11:05.921 --> 11:08.339
I don't feel like talking
about snack foods.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.093
Besides, I'm getting
real presents from him now.

11:12.177 --> 11:14.137
Oh...

11:15.013 --> 11:16.515
[Pennsatucky] Isn't that pretty?

11:16.598 --> 11:20.644
You know, like on the commercial
where the husband surprises the wife?

11:20.727 --> 11:22.896
[chuckles]
"Every kiss begins with Kay"?

11:22.979 --> 11:26.567
[chuckles]
Yeah, um, no offense,

11:26.650 --> 11:29.360
but that looks like some 99-cent bin shit.

11:29.445 --> 11:32.614
And it's gonna turn your wrist green.
Look, it already has, see?

11:33.949 --> 11:36.159
What the fuck?

11:41.873 --> 11:44.751
- What happened?
- Nothing.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.795
You're just jealous...

11:46.878 --> 11:49.130
'cause it's gold-plated with real gold.

11:49.214 --> 11:50.841
- Did he hurt you?
- No!

11:50.924 --> 11:53.218
You know, sometimes
when men get around boobies,

11:53.301 --> 11:54.427
they don't know how to act.

11:54.511 --> 11:56.387
- Okay? It's called hormones and stuff.
- [sighs]

11:56.472 --> 11:59.224
But I don't know if you know about that
'cause you're a muff muncher.

11:59.307 --> 12:00.809
Did he force you?

12:02.686 --> 12:04.980
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

12:05.063 --> 12:07.816
I mean, I could've used
a bit of a warm-up. [chuckles]

12:07.899 --> 12:10.652
Doesn't feel really good
when you're not ready.

12:10.736 --> 12:13.238
You know there's a word for that, right?

12:13.321 --> 12:14.405
No.

12:15.657 --> 12:18.619
Nah, it's not his fault.
Mmm-mmm. I was the one.

12:18.702 --> 12:21.246
I was flirting too much,
I was smiling,

12:21.329 --> 12:23.957
and I was really confusing.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.710
Take that shit off your wrist right now.

12:28.211 --> 12:32.007
He made a special trip to the mall for me.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.010
It's not his fault!

12:37.596 --> 12:38.930
Fuck.

12:41.474 --> 12:42.475
[Alex sighs]

12:44.561 --> 12:47.564
I just convinced Lolly
that I was a CIA operative

12:47.648 --> 12:51.359
so that she wouldn't rat on me
for attempting to choke her to death.

12:56.573 --> 12:58.784
Pipes, I'm losing it.

12:58.867 --> 13:01.077
I am totally spinning out.

13:01.161 --> 13:02.954
Well...

13:03.038 --> 13:05.123
like the Kinks say...

13:05.206 --> 13:07.042
"Paranoia, the destroya."

13:07.125 --> 13:10.003
Well, there is a red under my bed...

13:10.086 --> 13:11.755
and a little yellow man in my head.

13:11.838 --> 13:13.298
- Mmm-hmm.
- [chuckles]

13:15.091 --> 13:17.468
Sounds like it's...
it's getting pretty bad.

13:19.345 --> 13:22.098
I beat the shit out of
a crazy person. [scoffs]

13:23.559 --> 13:26.978
I imagine my death-by-shanking
every waking minute and...

13:28.730 --> 13:30.440
I completely convinced myself

13:30.523 --> 13:32.734
that you were hooking up
with that Stella chick.

13:33.819 --> 13:35.737
She has a Ninja Turtle tattoo.

13:35.821 --> 13:37.698
- I know!
- [Piper scoffs]

13:37.781 --> 13:40.158
And that annoying dingo-fucker accent.

13:40.241 --> 13:41.743
[both laugh]

13:43.829 --> 13:46.039
Please tell me
I have nothing to worry about.

13:49.585 --> 13:52.796
You have nothing to worry about.

13:57.342 --> 13:59.678
I'm sorry I've been so crazy.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.473
Forgive me?

14:04.850 --> 14:06.602
I forgive you.

14:13.524 --> 14:14.943
[Alex sighs]

14:20.406 --> 14:23.619
- What happened to you?
- None of your business.

14:23.702 --> 14:26.121
It was that fucking tranny's
what happened.

14:26.204 --> 14:27.205
[speaking Spanish]

14:27.288 --> 14:28.414
[speaking English]
People should know.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.041
You didn't get locked up
with a bunch of women

14:30.125 --> 14:32.335
so you could get beat on by a man.

14:32.418 --> 14:35.631
I don't know what's going on
with that dude, but he's raging out.

14:35.714 --> 14:36.965
Who? Sophia?

14:37.048 --> 14:39.384
Sophia? She don't cause no problems.

14:39.467 --> 14:40.636
[Aleida] Uh-uh.

14:40.719 --> 14:43.471
There's something wrong
with that he-she whatever.

14:43.554 --> 14:45.473
Maybe his hormones are off.

14:45.556 --> 14:50.020
He attacked Gloria.
This is a dangerous fucking situation.

14:50.103 --> 14:52.355
None of us are safe.

15:01.990 --> 15:03.659
Oops.

15:03.742 --> 15:05.535
Better watch where you're going.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.960
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

15:26.389 --> 15:29.643
Ladies, I was missing a panty drop
in my bunk this morning.

15:30.435 --> 15:32.896
Sorry, kiddo.
Talk to our rep.

15:32.979 --> 15:34.314
What are you talking about?

15:35.106 --> 15:38.652
We're exercising
our collective bargaining rights.

15:38.735 --> 15:41.822
You wanna renegotiate our contract,
she's right over there.

15:42.698 --> 15:44.615
[indistinct chatter]

15:50.413 --> 15:51.497
What's going on?

15:53.834 --> 15:56.211
We don't work for ramen no more.

15:56.294 --> 15:58.880
Fair pay for skanky pants.

16:00.548 --> 16:02.300
Yeah, what she said.

16:05.428 --> 16:09.099
Come back to me with
a better deal, and we'll talk.

16:12.477 --> 16:16.106
- 2-3-7-9.
- [computer beeps]

16:17.148 --> 16:19.776
Okay, you have $40
left in your commissary.

16:19.860 --> 16:23.196
Here's a check for the remainder.
Sign the back and we'll give you cash.

16:26.199 --> 16:27.993
There is a voucher
for your bus ticket.

16:30.370 --> 16:31.997
Fingerprints, please.

16:47.178 --> 16:48.346
Sign here.

16:55.812 --> 16:57.563
Hey, stranger.

16:57.647 --> 16:59.607
Are you avoiding me?

16:59.690 --> 17:02.485
- Yes.
- Care to elaborate?

17:03.486 --> 17:04.945
I...

17:05.864 --> 17:07.365
don't know what to say.
I have a, um...

17:07.448 --> 17:10.117
- An Alex?
- Yes, I have...

17:10.201 --> 17:12.287
[sighs] an Alex.

17:12.369 --> 17:16.958
Right, well, I'm crossing
the picket line here, but...

17:19.710 --> 17:23.131
I've outdone myself. Really.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.215
Let me know when you want more.

17:28.804 --> 17:29.805
[sighs]

17:33.266 --> 17:35.601
Uh, I've been waiting
in my bunk all morning

17:35.685 --> 17:37.103
for someone to come get me.

17:37.187 --> 17:39.647
- What time do I get to leave?
- What are you talking about?

17:39.730 --> 17:43.651
I'm supposed to be released today.
I gave away all my shit and everything.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.906
You know anything about
the inmates processing out today?

17:47.989 --> 17:49.407
Yeah, they left after count.

17:49.490 --> 17:50.826
What about Sara Rice?

17:50.909 --> 17:52.743
Yup, they took her, too.

17:52.828 --> 17:55.831
Then why is she standing in front of me?

17:56.790 --> 17:59.625
- [quietly] I don't...
- [sighs]

17:59.709 --> 18:01.294
I don't... I don't know.

18:01.377 --> 18:03.463
It's a miracle.

18:03.546 --> 18:05.631
She got out?
Out the blue?

18:05.715 --> 18:06.883
'Cause she believed.

18:06.967 --> 18:09.760
Yo, Norma!
You gotta hook a sister up.

18:09.845 --> 18:12.388
She can do it for all of us.

18:12.472 --> 18:14.182
I have faith, don't you?

18:14.265 --> 18:17.853
[all] Praise Norma!
Praise Norma!

18:20.897 --> 18:23.024
Here, I brought you these.

18:23.942 --> 18:29.405
[stammers] Um, here's a pencil
and a can of mackerel.

18:31.032 --> 18:32.075
[Brook] Norma?

18:32.158 --> 18:35.036
I'm being bullied by your group.
I thought you should know that.

18:36.121 --> 18:39.833
Oh, look, everyone,
it's God's gift to Litchfield.

18:39.916 --> 18:42.668
Shut up, Leanne.
I'm talking to Norma.

18:42.752 --> 18:44.170
[Leanne] Look at her...

18:44.254 --> 18:47.048
with her perfect teeth,
and her shiny skin,

18:47.132 --> 18:50.218
and her Pocahontas hair,
thinking she's better than us.

18:50.301 --> 18:51.970
I can't help it if I have Pocahontas hair,

18:52.053 --> 18:54.055
and it's not my fault
you chose meth over teeth!

18:54.139 --> 18:55.515
- Get the fuck out of here...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:55.598 --> 18:57.600
- You stuck-up bitch!
- [Brook] Oh, my God!

18:57.683 --> 18:59.310
How could you let this happen?

18:59.394 --> 19:01.729
I thought you were supposed
to be about kindness.

19:01.812 --> 19:04.983
You made me think that you care,
but you don't!

19:05.066 --> 19:07.443
And you let a bunch of crazies
speak for you.

19:07.527 --> 19:09.279
Shut the fuck up, Soso!

19:09.362 --> 19:11.614
And you're all just a bunch of
chicken-shit followers!

19:11.697 --> 19:14.117
What? Now I can't help you.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.244
Get out of here, seriously.

19:16.327 --> 19:18.704
Nice group you got here.

19:18.788 --> 19:20.081
Congrats on nothing.

19:26.171 --> 19:27.964
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

19:42.103 --> 19:44.814
- Which one are you?
- I'm Space Admiral Rodcocker.

19:44.898 --> 19:47.901
It was originally Donaldschlong.

19:47.984 --> 19:50.611
I think I might've made a mistake
by changing it.

19:51.529 --> 19:53.448
I see why you were disturbed.

19:53.531 --> 19:56.367
Yeah, and I don't know how
she knew about my birthmark.

20:01.497 --> 20:03.416
This is some sick stuff, Warren.

20:03.499 --> 20:06.127
A writer does not search out a muse.

20:06.211 --> 20:08.088
A muse appears.

20:08.171 --> 20:10.798
And when that muse
wears uniform pants

20:10.881 --> 20:12.883
that fit in all the right places,

20:12.968 --> 20:15.303
- it writes its...
- Okay, that's fine!

20:15.386 --> 20:18.098
How did you come up with
all this pornography stuff anyway?

20:19.015 --> 20:20.766
I wrote it for Berdie's class.

20:22.310 --> 20:25.021
Counselor Berdie Rogers,
she told you to write this?

20:25.105 --> 20:28.649
It was an exercise.
She wanted us to use our imaginations.

20:29.609 --> 20:32.237
Oh, this is the kind of stuff
you do in drama class?

20:33.113 --> 20:35.865
Well, not really.

20:35.949 --> 20:38.034
Berdie is more supportive

20:38.118 --> 20:41.454
of the murder stuff
than she is the sex stuff.

20:41.537 --> 20:43.248
Oh!

20:45.041 --> 20:46.292
Jesus...

20:48.461 --> 20:51.506
I knew there was something
wrong with that woman.

20:58.179 --> 21:00.265
Hey, so you're getting out, huh?

21:00.348 --> 21:01.682
Lucky.

21:01.766 --> 21:04.144
But I thought you had
a butt-load more time.

21:04.227 --> 21:05.770
- Nope.
- No?

21:05.853 --> 21:08.564
Doggett here don't wanna get out
'cause she'd miss me too much.

21:08.648 --> 21:09.774
Ain't that right, Doggett?

21:12.485 --> 21:13.944
Hey, can you pull in here?

21:17.157 --> 21:19.325
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

21:30.545 --> 21:32.213
So just like that?
I can go?

21:32.297 --> 21:34.257
That's how it works.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.801
Okay, then.

21:36.884 --> 21:38.428
Peace out, Penn.

21:39.762 --> 21:42.640
I'm sorry about all that shit with Leanne.
I always liked you anyway.

21:42.723 --> 21:43.933
Thanks, Ang.

21:45.726 --> 21:48.104
Hey, ain't your name Sara?

21:48.188 --> 21:49.897
Yeah.

21:52.733 --> 21:56.237
I call her "Ang" 'cause she
reminds me of Angelina Jolie.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.908
Don't you think?

22:01.784 --> 22:03.786
- I don't see it.
- I do.

22:03.869 --> 22:05.746
Whatever. Bye, Sara.

22:06.497 --> 22:08.958
Bye, Penn.
Good luck.

22:11.752 --> 22:14.505
Call the van,
tell 'em to turn around.

22:15.715 --> 22:18.634
What do you mean
they're not answering?

22:18.718 --> 22:20.386
Who is it? Coates?

22:21.929 --> 22:24.849
No, don't call the station.
I'll handle that.

22:24.932 --> 22:27.935
Get a message to Pearson,
tell him I need to see him immediately.

22:28.018 --> 22:29.437
Thank you.

22:31.147 --> 22:34.317
"Sara Rice" has been
dropped at the bus.

22:35.776 --> 22:38.904
Fuck! Fuck!

22:40.072 --> 22:41.491
How does this happen?

22:41.574 --> 22:44.535
The computer assigned her name
to Angie's ID number.

22:44.619 --> 22:48.456
This is MCC's fancy new system.
We gotta call their IT guy.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.958
- Why didn't anyone catch this?
- New COs.

22:51.041 --> 22:55.130
They don't know the inmates,
or, apparently, how to check a photo ID.

22:55.213 --> 22:56.714
It's a huge fuck-up.

22:56.797 --> 22:59.509
This wouldn't have happened
with senior staff.

22:59.592 --> 23:03.888
Christ, I can tell you how many
times a day Flores takes a dump.

23:03.971 --> 23:08.393
I know when Warren is just excited
versus having an episode.

23:08.476 --> 23:11.271
These newbies,
they don't even bother to learn names.

23:14.565 --> 23:16.192
Should we contact the marshals?

23:16.276 --> 23:17.860
No.

23:17.943 --> 23:19.612
Give me a minute.

23:21.071 --> 23:23.908
Maxwell, not a word of this.

23:23.991 --> 23:26.118
You know everybody here.

23:26.202 --> 23:28.746
- Who's in for organized crime?
- Me.

23:28.829 --> 23:31.374
Nah, I need to pick the brain
of a real criminal.

23:31.457 --> 23:34.001
Somebody who's...
more hardcore.

23:34.084 --> 23:36.921
"Hardcore"?
[chuckles]

23:37.004 --> 23:41.551
I worked with the Russian mafia.
We make the Italians look like guppies.

23:42.718 --> 23:45.513
This about your little panty business?

23:45.596 --> 23:48.516
- How do you know about that?
- You recruited my whole family.

23:48.599 --> 23:51.186
They're all running the track
in pink bikinis.

23:51.269 --> 23:53.103
First, you don't ask me to wear them,

23:53.188 --> 23:55.481
and now you undervalue
my criminal mastermind.

23:55.565 --> 23:58.318
You know what?
You really need to go fuck yourself.

23:59.735 --> 24:00.820
I need your advice.

24:00.903 --> 24:03.656
- I want 10% off the top.
- What?

24:05.491 --> 24:07.535
Your girls are rebelling.

24:07.618 --> 24:11.872
You're paying them in sodium and MSG,
and they want real money.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.458
You haven't a clue how to do that.

24:13.541 --> 24:16.961
And as for your one real resource,
your partner,

24:17.044 --> 24:19.797
well, you're fucking around on her.

24:20.881 --> 24:24.885
So it's only a matter of time
before that blows up in your face.

24:24.969 --> 24:27.763
Don't fuck where you eat,
or shit where you fuck.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.682
It's bad business.

24:33.811 --> 24:34.937
Eight percent.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.653
You need to get money
into their commissaries.

24:42.737 --> 24:45.030
And pay your girls a fair wage, huh?

24:45.114 --> 24:46.366
Mmm-hmm.

24:47.408 --> 24:49.744
You know what
Green Dot MoneyPak cards are?

24:49.827 --> 24:52.079
- No.
- No, of course you don't.

24:52.162 --> 24:55.416
They're cash top-up cards.
You're gonna need a cell phone.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.503
- Where am I gonna get a cell phone?
- Oh, the place is crawling with them.

24:58.586 --> 25:00.212
I found one in the bathroom once.

25:00.296 --> 25:01.881
Cell phones are like roaches.

25:01.964 --> 25:03.758
You see one, you'll know
there's another 100

25:03.841 --> 25:05.426
hidden in the walls.
[clicks tongue]

25:06.302 --> 25:07.637
Okay.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.973
Five other inmates in there
with the wrong numbers.

25:11.056 --> 25:13.851
This is the same operating system
we use at all of our prisons.

25:13.934 --> 25:15.853
Yeah, well,
you're lucky you caught it now

25:15.936 --> 25:19.231
- because, clearly, it blows.
- Yeah, this is bad.

25:19.315 --> 25:22.568
This is really bad.
I can't protect you on this one, Joe.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.406
- Me?
- Yeah.

25:26.489 --> 25:30.868
You're in charge of camp.
Shows a big lack of oversight.

25:31.744 --> 25:35.623
[exhales] Yeah... it does.

25:36.999 --> 25:41.379
'Cause the fish
stinks from the head.

25:41.462 --> 25:42.880
And I am not the head.

25:42.963 --> 25:47.092
I am actually
down by the gills somewhere.

25:48.303 --> 25:52.139
So, once I call the police
and the U.S. Marshals,

25:52.222 --> 25:55.184
and the DOC investigators
start sniffing around,

25:55.267 --> 25:57.144
it's going to look a lot worse

25:57.227 --> 26:01.023
for the Director of Human Activity
here at Litchfield.

26:01.106 --> 26:02.858
- Whoa, whoa.
- [mockingly] Whoo, whoa, whoa.

26:02.942 --> 26:04.527
- Yeah, whoa. Slow down.
- Yeah.

26:04.610 --> 26:06.987
Why do we have to involve
all those people in this?

26:07.071 --> 26:09.615
We have an escaped convict!

26:12.034 --> 26:14.203
- Let's just go get her back.
- Who?

26:14.286 --> 26:15.913
You and me.

26:15.996 --> 26:18.999
- Where did they take her?
- The bus station in Utica.

26:19.917 --> 26:23.295
Let's just get in a car.
We'll go get her. Bring her back.

26:23.379 --> 26:25.590
You know, nobody has to know.

26:25.673 --> 26:30.010
So you're saying the two of us should go
and apprehend an escaped convict?

26:31.471 --> 26:34.390
This is not the fucking
Bloodhound Gang, okay?

26:35.558 --> 26:37.393
Well, I don't know what to do.

26:37.477 --> 26:40.062
I honestly don't know
what the fuck to do!

26:40.145 --> 26:41.606
Do you know how I got this job?

26:41.689 --> 26:44.817
My dad is one of the SVPs at MCC.

26:45.526 --> 26:47.194
[scoffs]

26:47.277 --> 26:48.488
Yeah.

26:49.614 --> 26:53.368
This is gonna be worse than
when I got kicked out of Ohio University.

26:54.326 --> 26:57.162
I have no idea what I'm doing.

27:04.462 --> 27:05.671
Fine!

27:07.548 --> 27:09.675
I'll go.
On my own.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.176
Yeah?

27:11.844 --> 27:14.972
Someone needs to stay here
and keep a lid on things.

27:15.055 --> 27:16.306
- Great.
- Fuck it.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.519
If I can get her back,
no one needs to know, all the better.

27:21.353 --> 27:23.188
You're saving my ass, Joe.

27:24.607 --> 27:27.234
Nah... I'm saving my ass.

27:28.235 --> 27:30.738
[men cheering]

27:33.282 --> 27:38.454
Here's to the new opening act
for the East Coast tour of Glass Tiger.

27:38.538 --> 27:40.080
- [Jeff] Hell, yeah!
- All right!

27:40.164 --> 27:41.457
Soon to be the headliners!

27:41.541 --> 27:43.083
- The Jeff Spurber Band!
- Right on.

27:43.167 --> 27:45.335
- We need a new name.
- I like our name.

27:45.420 --> 27:48.130
Of course you like our name,
you're Jeff Spurber.

27:48.213 --> 27:49.757
But you're the tambourine player, dude.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.592
I'm the lead singer.

27:51.676 --> 27:53.678
If we're gonna be named for someone,
it should be me.

27:53.761 --> 27:55.638
- It's my garage.
- [Caputo] Hey!

27:55.721 --> 27:58.766
If Hank and I can get along
after the shit he pulled,

27:58.849 --> 28:00.976
you guys can work it out.

28:02.311 --> 28:05.940
We're looking at ten months
on the road. Let's enjoy it.

28:06.023 --> 28:08.192
Come on,
this is a huge fucking deal for us.

28:08.275 --> 28:10.653
Come on. Come on.

28:12.362 --> 28:14.449
- Lis.
- Hank.

28:18.118 --> 28:20.788
Joey, you got a second?

28:20.871 --> 28:23.207
- Could we talk outside?
- Yeah, babe.

28:23.290 --> 28:25.418
[stammers] Are you sure?

28:27.086 --> 28:28.463
Four months.

28:28.546 --> 28:29.672
So it's...

28:30.840 --> 28:33.092
- it's a real thing...
- [chuckles]

28:33.175 --> 28:34.677
Floating around in there?

28:36.887 --> 28:37.972
How big is it?

28:39.139 --> 28:40.641
Like an avocado.

28:40.725 --> 28:42.435
- Jesus!
- [laughs]

28:42.518 --> 28:43.603
An avocado?

28:44.645 --> 28:47.440
[laughing]

28:47.523 --> 28:48.941
[laughs nervously]

28:49.024 --> 28:51.694
It's great!
It's great.

28:51.777 --> 28:53.488
Lisa, we're gonna have a baby!

28:53.571 --> 28:56.198
- Joey, do the math.
- What?

28:56.281 --> 28:59.660
Four months ago, we were broken up.
I was with Hank.

28:59.744 --> 29:01.704
Four months ago was July.
What are you...

29:07.126 --> 29:09.169
What are you sayin'?

29:12.131 --> 29:13.132
It's his?

29:14.174 --> 29:15.676
Yeah.

29:15.760 --> 29:16.927
Does he know?

29:18.178 --> 29:20.681
I wanted to tell you first.

29:20.765 --> 29:23.851
I've been so guilty about
everything I put you through, and...

29:23.934 --> 29:26.311
now that we're back together, I...

29:27.271 --> 29:29.148
This is so fucked up.

29:30.315 --> 29:31.984
You have every right to hate me.

29:32.067 --> 29:33.986
I love you.

29:34.069 --> 29:36.989
I just thought you should know
because you guys are going on tour and...

29:37.072 --> 29:39.617
I won't go.
I'll stay here.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.702
You have to go!
This is your big break!

29:41.786 --> 29:43.078
That's not why I told you.

29:43.162 --> 29:45.455
Fuck it, they can do it without me.
Fuck it.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.833
Joey, you can't do that.
We'll be fine.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.168
I'm gonna move back in
with my parents.

29:49.251 --> 29:51.003
I already asked for
more shifts at Paddy's.

29:51.086 --> 29:52.630
I'm staying here.

29:53.589 --> 29:56.717
I'm gonna take care of you
and this baby.

29:58.719 --> 30:00.262
I'll tell them right now.

30:00.345 --> 30:02.472
You stay and Hank goes?

30:02.557 --> 30:05.225
Joey, why would you do that?
It makes no sense.

30:05.309 --> 30:06.852
I love you.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.855
I wanna marry you.

30:11.065 --> 30:13.776
I wanna have a family with you.

30:13.859 --> 30:15.444
Hey!

30:15.528 --> 30:16.987
Me and you...

30:18.238 --> 30:19.323
and Avocado.

30:19.406 --> 30:20.741
[laughs]

31:34.982 --> 31:36.233
[sighs]

31:36.316 --> 31:38.402
Aleida's full of shit sometimes,
but I believe her.

31:38.485 --> 31:40.821
I do, too. They said
she tried to chop it off herself.

31:40.905 --> 31:42.239
[Blanca] Hmm.

31:42.322 --> 31:45.034
Oh, I heard she's off her meds
and her penis is growing back.

31:45.117 --> 31:47.828
I heard she was an ultimate fighter
before she turned into a chick.

31:47.912 --> 31:49.454
Well, you heard wrong.

31:49.538 --> 31:54.001
But I will happily go all UFC on your ass
if you keep spreadin' that shit.

31:57.587 --> 31:59.131
Taystee.

32:00.257 --> 32:02.217
Where'd you get that weave, girl?

32:02.301 --> 32:04.679
Don't tell me you went to Danita.

32:04.762 --> 32:07.848
I thought I'd switch it up.
She ain't bad.

32:07.932 --> 32:11.268
Ain't bad? I can see those tracks
from down the hallway.

32:12.645 --> 32:14.730
Look, other people
gotta make a living, too.

32:14.814 --> 32:16.816
My salon has been empty all day.

32:16.899 --> 32:19.652
You think I don't know those Spanish girls
been spreading shit about me?

32:19.735 --> 32:21.195
I don't wanna get involved.

32:22.237 --> 32:24.281
What's wrong with you?

32:24.364 --> 32:25.783
What's wrong with all of you?

32:25.866 --> 32:30.120
Acting like a bunch of stupid,
transphobic bitches!

32:31.496 --> 32:34.208
You know what the worst part of
becoming a woman is?

32:34.291 --> 32:38.170
Having to participate
in this catty, backstabby bullshit!

32:38.253 --> 32:41.841
You don't wanna get your hair done?
You wanna whisper behind my back?

32:41.924 --> 32:45.845
Then fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

32:53.518 --> 32:56.021
- [laughing]
- [sing song] We're in business.

32:56.105 --> 32:58.941
- No way. Whose?
- Mmm-hmm. I've no idea.

32:59.024 --> 33:02.236
There's probably 50 of 'em in here.
This place is crawling with contraband.

33:02.319 --> 33:04.196
You know, I found a blunt,
a lighter,

33:04.279 --> 33:06.741
and a shank made
out of Jolly Ranchers.

33:06.824 --> 33:08.658
Why do you need a phone?

33:10.035 --> 33:11.245
To transfer money.

33:11.328 --> 33:15.332
Each girl is gonna get
a prepaid card on the outside,

33:15.415 --> 33:17.167
give me a 14-digit code,

33:17.251 --> 33:20.838
and then I can wire money
directly into her account

33:20.921 --> 33:23.382
with the touch of a button.

33:23.465 --> 33:24.674
It's called MoneyPak.

33:24.759 --> 33:27.552
Yeah, I know what it's called.
I'm a drug dealer.

33:29.388 --> 33:31.223
Pipes, this is what prison gangs do.

33:31.306 --> 33:34.143
- I know! It's brilliant, right?
- No.

33:34.226 --> 33:35.685
This was a silly distraction,

33:35.770 --> 33:39.148
so we could have some fun
and make a few bucks.

33:39.231 --> 33:43.027
What you're talking about now
is a crime network, okay?

33:43.110 --> 33:45.154
This is the kind of shit
that landed me in here.

33:45.237 --> 33:46.822
So you'll be extra good at it.

33:46.906 --> 33:48.240
Uh-uh.

33:49.241 --> 33:52.702
I'm serious, Pipes. I'm not up for
taking this thing next level.

33:52.787 --> 33:56.706
What happened to that scary, professional
felon I fell in love with, huh?

33:56.791 --> 33:58.667
She was so hot.

33:58.751 --> 34:00.961
Seriously, grow up.

34:04.882 --> 34:08.969
Put one between your knees
and one under your belly. Here.

34:13.014 --> 34:14.433
Why you being so nice?

34:15.684 --> 34:17.018
'Cause I know where you're at.

34:17.101 --> 34:19.063
And, listen...

34:19.146 --> 34:20.981
when your real contractions start...

34:21.065 --> 34:22.858
- Okay.
- You gotta just surrender.

34:22.942 --> 34:26.735
'Cause the more you fight that shit,
the worse it gets.

34:26.821 --> 34:29.072
And it also helps if you moan.

34:29.156 --> 34:31.199
Low, low, like a cow, like...

34:31.283 --> 34:33.118
[moaning deeply]

34:37.081 --> 34:39.208
I don't know why, but something
about opening your throat

34:39.291 --> 34:41.293
makes everything else open up, too.

34:41.376 --> 34:44.670
And pushing feels like shitting,
like you're taking a giant shit.

34:44.754 --> 34:47.800
Ew! That's so gross!

34:47.882 --> 34:49.426
And when they tell you
that they can see the head,

34:49.509 --> 34:51.678
- you got to back off...
- [softly] The head?

34:51.761 --> 34:54.264
And you gotta go slow

34:54.348 --> 34:56.350
so that you don't
tear your shit up, you know?

34:56.433 --> 34:58.685
Stop it, stop it.
I don't even wanna think about that.

34:58.768 --> 35:00.354
I'm just glad everything's
gonna be over soon.

35:00.437 --> 35:01.480
Not really.

35:01.563 --> 35:04.900
You're gonna have a baby
for the rest of your life.

35:08.237 --> 35:10.739
No, I'm giving it away.

35:13.075 --> 35:14.201
What?

35:17.162 --> 35:21.291
- To who?
- To this lady that's been visiting me.

35:21.375 --> 35:24.419
She's really nice,
has a lot of money, and...

35:24.503 --> 35:26.546
my mom thinks I should do it, so...

35:26.630 --> 35:27.714
Aleida?

35:29.799 --> 35:31.385
What are you, fucking crazy?

35:31.468 --> 35:34.304
It ain't right for me to keep a baby
if I'm not gonna be around.

35:34.388 --> 35:35.680
[gasps softly]

35:37.933 --> 35:39.894
So you're saying
I did the wrong thing, huh?

35:41.436 --> 35:43.647
You don't even
get to see her anymore.

35:43.730 --> 35:47.317
Yeah, but at least I know
that she's with her family.

35:47.401 --> 35:50.779
I would give anything to
see my baby for five minutes,

35:50.863 --> 35:54.533
and you're gonna give yours away?
To a stranger?

35:54.616 --> 35:55.825
[scoffs]

35:55.910 --> 35:58.954
You know,
I may be a fucked-up mom,

35:59.038 --> 36:02.332
but at least I didn't sell mine
to the highest bidder.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.335
Yo, give me my fucking pillow back.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.463
I hope she rips you wide open.

36:11.508 --> 36:15.595
What happens if they fire us before
we get officially approved as a union?

36:15.679 --> 36:18.473
Or so they don't get sued,
they start enforcing weird rules.

36:18.557 --> 36:20.517
You know, pin it on that.
These guys are wily.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.727
This is how corporations
been intimidating people

36:22.811 --> 36:24.146
since the beginning of time.

36:24.229 --> 36:26.606
You know, people died
for the eight-hour work day, man.

36:26.690 --> 36:29.068
"Not being heard
is no reason for silence."

36:30.652 --> 36:31.736
That's deep.

36:32.779 --> 36:35.157
It's from Les Mis.
We watched it last night.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.658
Poor Russell Crowe.

36:36.741 --> 36:39.703
The guy sings like a dead carp
getting a blowjob.

36:39.786 --> 36:41.205
- [laughing]
- What about a blowjob?

36:41.288 --> 36:42.414
We're having a union meeting.

36:42.497 --> 36:45.125
Oh, that sounds like a lot less fun.

36:45.209 --> 36:47.127
If you knew what was good for you,
you'd join us.

36:47.211 --> 36:48.420
Don't see any need to rock the boat.

36:48.503 --> 36:50.672
No, no, come to a meeting, at least.

36:50.755 --> 36:52.007
No, thanks.

36:53.342 --> 36:54.509
It's at Freddy's Bar.

36:54.593 --> 36:57.762
$2 shots if you use
the code word "union."

36:58.680 --> 37:01.225
Well, in that case...

37:02.309 --> 37:03.978
[chanting]
What do we want? JÃ¤ger.

37:04.061 --> 37:06.063
When do we want it? Now.

37:06.146 --> 37:07.397
- [grunts]
- [laughing]

37:08.565 --> 37:10.859
- This is insane.
- [Pearson] It's not insane, Joe.

37:10.943 --> 37:12.902
It's, uh... it's plucky.

37:12.987 --> 37:15.405
- Right.
- And don't worry about camp.

37:15.489 --> 37:17.657
I'm handling shit over here.

37:17.741 --> 37:20.827
There's a new sheriff in town.
I'm cracking heads, taking names.

37:20.910 --> 37:23.247
I thought you were just
holding down the fort.

37:23.330 --> 37:24.498
Well, yeah.

37:24.581 --> 37:27.960
Apparently, the fort has been
corrupted by one Berdie Rogers.

37:28.043 --> 37:29.836
This is surprising to me.

37:29.919 --> 37:33.090
Well, the stuff she's encouraging
in her class, I mean...

37:33.173 --> 37:35.050
After the sexual-harassment training,

37:35.134 --> 37:37.136
we just can't tolerate this.

37:37.219 --> 37:39.846
Please hold off.
We need to review.

37:39.929 --> 37:42.432
Already taken care of, buddy.

37:42.516 --> 37:44.518
- You're a good man, Joe Caputo.
- [sighs]

37:45.560 --> 37:48.397
Probably, uh... probably too good
for the job you're doing.

37:50.649 --> 37:53.485
The Olympics have been on here 24/7.

37:53.568 --> 37:55.612
I'm partial to the diving, myself.

37:55.695 --> 37:58.448
You seen that 13-year-old
Chinese kid win the high dive?

37:58.532 --> 38:01.493
Fu something?
Amazing shit.

38:01.576 --> 38:05.247
Boy, it's the parents that kill me
when I watch the coverage.

38:05.330 --> 38:08.250
- You got kids?
- Uh, I've got one on the way.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.169
- Ah, congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.

38:10.252 --> 38:12.129
That's why I took the job,
for the benefits.

38:12.212 --> 38:13.672
Well, you get decent coverage.

38:13.755 --> 38:17.301
Vision and dental's a little spotty,
but it's better than nothing,

38:17.384 --> 38:19.636
especially if you got
a little one coming.

38:19.719 --> 38:22.722
[groans] Sorry about the smell.
It's the pipes.

38:22.806 --> 38:25.059
They don't fix shit around here.

38:25.142 --> 38:26.810
Come on, this is the TV room.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.397
There's lots of fighting
over the channel,

38:30.480 --> 38:32.191
so each group gets their time.

38:33.358 --> 38:35.319
Rosa here knows the drill.

38:37.404 --> 38:40.490
The whites got the mornings till 10:00.

38:40.574 --> 38:44.994
Then the blacks and the Spanish
take over at lunch.

38:45.079 --> 38:47.497
Keeps rotating like that.

38:47.581 --> 38:49.208
But me?

38:49.291 --> 38:52.711
I watch what I want,
when I want to.

38:54.629 --> 38:55.672
You like wrestling?

38:57.466 --> 39:00.719
Oh, yeah, uh...
I used to compete.

39:00.802 --> 39:04.223
I dislocated my shoulder,
and that ended that.

39:04.306 --> 39:06.725
Huh, so that could've been you.

39:06.808 --> 39:09.728
I guess. [chuckles]
In a parallel universe.

39:09.811 --> 39:12.814
Ha! "Parallel universe."
That's good.

39:12.897 --> 39:15.317
Come on,
let me show you the dorm.

39:19.738 --> 39:22.407
All right, ladies,
I've heard your complaints,

39:22.491 --> 39:26.703
and I have made arrangements
for everybody to get paid, cash money.

39:26.786 --> 39:29.873
Someone on the outside
will pick up a cash card.

39:29.956 --> 39:31.625
Get me the number,

39:31.708 --> 39:34.378
and then we'll start depositing funds
into your accounts.

39:34.461 --> 39:38.006
I'm offering you eight bucks a pair,

39:38.090 --> 39:39.633
and I'm holding you all
to quality control.

39:39.716 --> 39:41.593
There is no cutting corners.

39:41.676 --> 39:44.012
What about benefits, huh?

39:44.096 --> 39:45.347
- Benefits?
- Yeah.

39:45.430 --> 39:47.516
Yeah, what about all
the, uh, flavor packets?

39:47.599 --> 39:49.684
- We are full-time employees.
- Mmm.

39:50.602 --> 39:53.147
All right, everybody gets one chicken
and one beef a week until I'm out.

39:53.230 --> 39:56.108
I don't wanna wear the bikinis anymore.

39:56.191 --> 39:57.942
- They ride up my butt.
- [inmates laughing]

39:58.026 --> 40:00.612
And Jones will only
be wearing boy shorts.

40:00.695 --> 40:01.863
I want a thong.

40:01.946 --> 40:03.907
Jesus Christ. Anybody else?

40:05.409 --> 40:07.244
Good. Congratulations.

40:07.327 --> 40:09.913
You are all now official employees.

40:09.996 --> 40:11.123
[Big Boo] Oh, pussy pennies!

40:11.206 --> 40:13.792
We're in the money! Ka-ching!

40:13.875 --> 40:16.295
You can all thank me for that.

40:16.378 --> 40:17.837
Oh, and Flaca...

40:17.921 --> 40:19.005
you're fired.

40:19.088 --> 40:21.425
- What?
- Oh, shit.

40:21.508 --> 40:22.676
You can't do that.

40:22.759 --> 40:24.928
I can do whatever I want.

40:25.011 --> 40:26.180
Get out.

40:27.264 --> 40:29.933
And remember, you will be costing
each one of your closest friends

40:30.016 --> 40:33.478
hundreds of dollars a month
if you so much as open your mouth.

40:34.396 --> 40:36.898
So I suggest that you leave quietly.

40:38.150 --> 40:39.609
You're fucked up.

40:45.449 --> 40:46.700
Bye-bye.

40:52.247 --> 40:54.040
Heard you got busted.
[chuckles]

40:54.123 --> 40:57.711
[exclaims]
Healy was mad.

40:57.794 --> 40:59.546
He confiscate it?

40:59.629 --> 41:00.672
[sighs]

41:01.840 --> 41:04.384
Yo, fuck him, man.
Start over.

41:04.468 --> 41:08.054
Or write a sequel.
Make it a three-parter like Hunger Games.

41:08.137 --> 41:11.266
No. I feel lighter.

41:11.350 --> 41:14.186
And all those fans with their ideas...

41:14.269 --> 41:16.062
My head was gonna explode.
[chuckles]

41:16.855 --> 41:18.607
So, you quitting?

41:20.442 --> 41:21.693
[sighs]

41:23.027 --> 41:24.279
Whatever then.

41:35.123 --> 41:39.378
I don't think the people even like me.
They just like my story.

41:39.461 --> 41:40.712
You don't like me.

41:40.795 --> 41:43.298
Yeah, true, but that ain't my fault.

41:43.382 --> 41:47.051
I mean, you beat the shit out of me,
cracked one of my ribs.

41:47.135 --> 41:50.764
- I got a right to hold a grudge.
- No, I was protecting Vee.

41:50.847 --> 41:52.599
Vee didn't need protection.

41:52.682 --> 41:55.519
Vee was a thug.
She preyed on you.

41:55.602 --> 41:58.980
- You think I'm stupid.
- I think you're vulnerable.

41:59.063 --> 42:01.024
Yeah, well...

42:02.025 --> 42:04.236
Vee treated me like a person.

42:05.904 --> 42:08.240
Everybody else thinks I'm a joke.

42:09.616 --> 42:11.200
She loved me.

42:13.495 --> 42:15.830
People need love.

42:18.124 --> 42:19.334
I know.

42:23.588 --> 42:25.590
I'm sorry I hurt you.

42:42.941 --> 42:43.942
[sniffs]

42:45.985 --> 42:48.029
[sighs]

42:48.780 --> 42:50.615
Heard you're in a bit of hot water.

42:50.699 --> 42:55.454
Temporary leave while MCC
does an independent investigation.

42:55.537 --> 42:58.332
I had nothing to do with that erotica.

42:58.415 --> 43:00.584
She wrote it for your class.

43:00.667 --> 43:03.545
No, she thinks
she wrote it for my class,

43:03.628 --> 43:05.547
because that's the way children think.

43:05.630 --> 43:07.466
I've worked with a lot of kids
in the foster system.

43:07.549 --> 43:10.469
She's functioning like a six-year-old.

43:10.552 --> 43:14.639
A perverted six-year-old,
but a six-year-old.

43:15.139 --> 43:19.060
You know, it takes a long time
to find the boundaries with these girls.

43:20.604 --> 43:22.647
And it's not for everyone.

43:23.982 --> 43:25.692
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

43:25.775 --> 43:28.236
You've had it in for me
since I started here.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.823
I merely passed along information
that was brought to me.

43:34.868 --> 43:37.078
What exactly is your real issue?

43:37.746 --> 43:42.959
See... I can't quite pin down
whether you're a misogynist,

43:43.042 --> 43:44.878
or a racist,

43:44.961 --> 43:48.423
or a winning combination of the two.

43:48.507 --> 43:51.300
You foster inappropriate relationships,

43:51.385 --> 43:53.470
you walk around here
like you own the place.

43:53.553 --> 43:56.515
You come in here every week
with a different hairstyle,

43:56.598 --> 43:59.893
and your class is a festering
incubator of deviance!

44:00.977 --> 44:03.813
You're a vengeful little man,
aren't you?

44:05.231 --> 44:07.859
But I'll be back.

44:07.942 --> 44:11.655
Because I am good at what I do.

44:29.172 --> 44:30.882
[sighs] Shit!

44:31.925 --> 44:33.468
Let's go, Rice.

44:33.552 --> 44:35.011
Can I finish my soda?

44:36.680 --> 44:39.265
Come on, man.
You're about to take me back to prison.

44:46.105 --> 44:48.858
What the fuck are you still doing here?

44:50.860 --> 44:53.279
I didn't know where to go.

44:53.362 --> 44:57.325
I only got a voucher to Jersey,
and I don't know anyone there.

44:57.408 --> 44:59.828
I guess I should've walked
to the Amtrak station,

44:59.911 --> 45:02.371
but I only got 40 bucks.

45:02.456 --> 45:05.208
Did it not occur to you
that we'd come after you?

45:06.042 --> 45:07.961
I don't know.

45:08.044 --> 45:10.254
I kept a pet frog
in the laundry for eight months,

45:10.338 --> 45:12.381
and no one ever noticed.

45:12.466 --> 45:14.509
Things are always crazy over there.

45:16.385 --> 45:18.555
But freedom feels weird.

45:20.515 --> 45:23.852
I guess I'm not very good
at this whole escaping thing.

45:25.311 --> 45:26.938
I can run.

45:27.021 --> 45:30.149
You don't got a gun or nothing.
You didn't bring any cops?

45:30.233 --> 45:32.193
Yeah, well...

45:32.276 --> 45:35.279
you can come with me now
without an argument

45:35.363 --> 45:37.949
and spend a few nights in Seg...

45:38.032 --> 45:41.745
or I can call the cops
and take you back forcibly,

45:41.828 --> 45:45.999
in which case you leave me no choice
but to charge you with attempted escape...

45:46.082 --> 45:48.334
- and extend your sentence.
- [sighs]

45:48.417 --> 45:50.086
I'm doing you a solid here.

45:51.546 --> 45:54.716
- I ain't gonna say thank you.
- Well, you should.

45:55.675 --> 45:58.637
So you wanna look like a big shot, huh?

45:58.720 --> 46:00.555
Get all the glory yourself?

46:00.639 --> 46:02.098
[scoffs]

46:06.185 --> 46:08.312
[chuckles] Come on.

46:08.396 --> 46:09.898
Let's go.
Up and at 'em.

46:09.981 --> 46:12.609
You tell me one person would've
turned down the opportunity I got.

46:12.692 --> 46:14.027
One person.

46:14.986 --> 46:16.237
I do see your point.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.281
What if I suck your dick?

46:19.448 --> 46:22.076
You're still going back.
Come on, let's go.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.996
So, is that a yes or a no?

46:25.955 --> 46:28.708
No, thank you.
Let's go.

46:35.549 --> 46:36.675
[Caputo] A frog?

46:36.758 --> 46:40.178
[Angie] We named him Benny.
But then he suffocated and he died.

46:40.261 --> 46:41.596
[Caputo] That's what happens in prison.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.972
[snoring]

47:10.541 --> 47:11.793
[gasps]

47:13.002 --> 47:14.713
[whimpers] Oh, my God.

47:21.845 --> 47:23.597
[whimpering]

47:32.105 --> 47:35.066
Hey, here's the man of the hour!

47:35.149 --> 47:38.111
Encyclopedia Brown
and the Case of the Missing Meth Addict.

47:38.194 --> 47:41.114
- Sorry.
- Yeah, well, she's in the SHU.

47:42.115 --> 47:46.160
Poor kid...
you can't blame her.

47:46.244 --> 47:49.956
We got lucky this time.
It could've been a lot worse.

47:50.039 --> 47:53.167
Uh, I don't know what
I can do to thank you.

47:53.251 --> 47:55.544
I want my guys back full time.

47:55.629 --> 47:59.007
I want their old hours back.
And they need medical.

47:59.090 --> 48:01.843
I've heard rumblings about union stuff.
Are you in on that?

48:01.926 --> 48:04.428
It's not a matter of
being in on it or not.

48:04.512 --> 48:07.598
You want employees
to show up and do a good job, you...

48:07.682 --> 48:10.977
- you gotta take care of them.
- I get it.

48:11.060 --> 48:12.812
I mean, everybody
has a right to organize,

48:12.896 --> 48:15.148
but if MCC has to
start covering benefits,

48:15.231 --> 48:17.025
the whole venture's gonna fold.
I mean...

48:17.108 --> 48:19.903
it's shortsighted, you know?
We're all gonna be out of work.

48:19.986 --> 48:24.365
Are you being straight with me?
Or is that just union-busting jargon?

48:24.448 --> 48:27.618
I don't know about you,
but I like having a job, Joe.

48:27.702 --> 48:31.122
I respect that you look out
for the underdog.

48:31.205 --> 48:34.668
It seems like you're the kind of guy
who does that a lot, but...

48:34.751 --> 48:36.460
how's that working out for you?

48:38.379 --> 48:39.839
I don't know.

48:43.176 --> 48:45.303
Have you seen my car?

48:45.386 --> 48:47.596
Maybe it's time you stopped
worrying about everybody else

48:47.681 --> 48:49.140
and did something for you.

48:50.391 --> 48:52.601
That's what everybody else
in America does.

49:04.113 --> 49:05.364
[sighs]

49:17.794 --> 49:19.003
[chuckles]

49:19.087 --> 49:23.007
It took me an hour to get her down.
She's stubborn as fuck.

49:24.467 --> 49:25.551
What's this?

49:26.803 --> 49:28.346
You going somewhere?

49:29.555 --> 49:32.851
Hank's back in town.
They came home to record a new album.

49:32.934 --> 49:35.186
Did you know
they sold out their last tour?

49:35.269 --> 49:37.188
Yeah.

49:37.271 --> 49:39.398
They're crushing it.

49:40.817 --> 49:43.402
He came by yesterday.

49:43.486 --> 49:44.653
He wanted to see her.

49:44.738 --> 49:47.991
- Now he wants to see her?
- Joey, he's her father.

49:48.074 --> 49:49.993
I'm her father.

49:50.076 --> 49:51.619
I'm the one who stuck around.

49:51.702 --> 49:53.412
He's her real father.

49:54.413 --> 49:57.708
He has a right to have
a relationship with her.

50:05.925 --> 50:07.176
You're leaving me for Hank.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.095
He's doing really well for himself.

50:09.178 --> 50:11.806
They made a big chunk of change
on that Warner's deal.

50:13.057 --> 50:15.434
- He has ambition.
- And I don't?

50:17.854 --> 50:19.605
I love him.

50:21.607 --> 50:23.109
I always have.

50:23.192 --> 50:24.819
You know that.

50:24.903 --> 50:27.446
I wanna see if we could be a family.

50:28.322 --> 50:31.325
You have a family.
I'm your family.

50:31.409 --> 50:35.204
Joey, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us,

50:35.288 --> 50:37.581
and I couldn't have done it without you.

50:37.665 --> 50:41.127
And I love you, too, but...

50:41.210 --> 50:43.087
it's different.

50:44.380 --> 50:45.673
I started that band.

50:45.756 --> 50:49.677
Those guys wouldn't have even
known each other if it wasn't for me.

50:52.096 --> 50:53.639
I gave up everything.

50:54.974 --> 50:59.187
I took a job in a prison,
for fuck's sake.

50:59.270 --> 51:01.189
Didn't know you were running a tab.

51:01.272 --> 51:03.441
You know how depressing my life is?

51:03.524 --> 51:07.987
You think I wanna work
a security job for 20,000 a year?

51:08.071 --> 51:09.447
I did this for you!

51:09.530 --> 51:11.240
No one asked you to!

51:11.324 --> 51:13.409
- I was clear all along!
- I saved you!

51:13.492 --> 51:14.869
I didn't need saving!

51:14.953 --> 51:17.496
You'd still be slutting it up
down at Paddy's if it wasn't for me.

51:19.916 --> 51:21.500
That was ugly, Joe.

51:23.377 --> 51:26.714
Take some responsibility
for your choices.

51:27.882 --> 51:31.177
Nobody got you here but you.

51:31.260 --> 51:34.055
You can't spend your whole life
holding the door open for people

51:34.138 --> 51:37.016
and then being angry
when they don't thank you.

51:38.351 --> 51:40.895
Nobody asked you
to hold the fucking door!

51:40.979 --> 51:42.563
[baby crying]

51:43.481 --> 51:45.900
Great... you woke up the baby.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.123
There you go.

52:00.206 --> 52:02.750
- What's all that for?
- Well, I, uh...

52:03.877 --> 52:05.044
I want you to go down on me.

52:05.128 --> 52:06.670
What?

52:06.754 --> 52:08.464
Hell, no.
That's disgusting.

52:08.547 --> 52:11.885
Yeah, but I'm feeling horny,
so I'm buying you.

52:11.968 --> 52:14.220
Look, there's some M&M'S in there.

52:14.303 --> 52:16.472
So let's go.
Get me off.

52:16.555 --> 52:18.557
- That's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

52:19.350 --> 52:22.520
You're for sale,
so I'm purchasing your services.

52:22.603 --> 52:25.314
Just, you know, check out,
go to your happy place.

52:25.398 --> 52:26.815
I'll be quick.

52:28.817 --> 52:30.028
[softly] Stop that.

52:30.111 --> 52:31.905
And maybe I'll sodomize you
while I'm at it.

52:31.988 --> 52:33.864
You know, stick a hairbrush up your ass.

52:33.948 --> 52:36.367
Hold you down, pull your hair,
maybe bite your neck.

52:36.450 --> 52:38.912
Wouldn't that be fun?
You might like that.

52:38.995 --> 52:41.039
Why don't you try it, huh?
Why don't you try that?

52:41.122 --> 52:43.457
Just let me have
my fucking way with you.

52:43.541 --> 52:44.583
Hey, I could tie you up.

52:44.667 --> 52:46.794
We could maybe use
your fucking T-shirt as a gag, huh?

52:46.877 --> 52:48.087
[loudly] Would you stop it?

52:48.171 --> 52:49.672
I'm gonna do whatever
I fucking want to you,

52:49.755 --> 52:51.215
and you're gonna lie down
and you're gonna take it,

52:51.299 --> 52:53.051
because that's the way this works,
isn't it?

52:53.134 --> 52:54.510
Isn't that it?

52:55.929 --> 52:57.596
[crying] Stop that.

53:00.724 --> 53:02.101
Stop it.

53:04.770 --> 53:07.065
I wanted to stop.

53:07.148 --> 53:11.777
I wanted to stop so bad.
I wanted him to stop.

53:13.112 --> 53:16.324
- Good.
- [sobbing]

53:16.407 --> 53:18.492
'Cause we're gonna
get that motherfucker.

53:20.286 --> 53:22.913
Come on.
It's okay.

53:25.874 --> 53:28.377
You should've seen her face.

53:28.461 --> 53:31.505
I mean, I got them. They were all
practically drooling over the money.

53:31.589 --> 53:34.383
And then I turned to her
in front of everybody, and I'm all...

53:35.384 --> 53:36.677
"Oh...

53:36.760 --> 53:38.012
and, by the way...

53:39.097 --> 53:41.265
Flaca, you're fired."

53:43.226 --> 53:46.479
That'll teach the little bitch
not to instigate!

53:46.562 --> 53:48.982
- That's gross.
- No, it was badass.

53:50.858 --> 53:54.153
- I'm out.
- What?

53:54.237 --> 53:56.072
I don't wanna be involved.

53:58.657 --> 53:59.908
With what, the business?

53:59.993 --> 54:02.411
With any of it.

54:02.495 --> 54:04.705
What you did to Flaca was weird, Piper.

54:04.788 --> 54:08.042
She's poor.
A lot of these girls, they're poor.

54:08.126 --> 54:10.544
Of course they were excited about money.

54:10.628 --> 54:12.796
They're excited about
a dollar-an-hour job.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.092
- Okay.
- I don't like this version of you.

54:16.175 --> 54:18.469
Well, maybe I don't like
this version of you.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.514
[scoffs] What version is that?

54:21.597 --> 54:25.309
The paranoid, needy version.
The judge-y version.

54:26.269 --> 54:29.230
I mean, fuck, Alex,
what is your problem?

54:30.356 --> 54:33.484
You have no idea what you're getting into.

54:33.567 --> 54:36.904
You don't know who these people are,
you don't know who they're connected to,

54:36.987 --> 54:39.115
and you're on
some weird little power trip.

54:39.198 --> 54:44.453
I am doing exactly what you did,
and you cannot handle it

54:44.537 --> 54:47.123
because you're afraid
I might be better at it than you are.

54:47.206 --> 54:48.457
[scoffs]

54:51.669 --> 54:52.961
[inhales deeply]

54:53.046 --> 54:55.173
You probably are better at it now.

54:56.715 --> 54:58.634
You're a natural.

55:00.553 --> 55:02.012
I'm out, Pipes.

55:03.013 --> 55:06.392
I'm out of that and...

55:06.475 --> 55:08.061
I'm out of this.

55:12.690 --> 55:17.611
So, who's gonna rep us?
We need to elect a leader.

55:17.695 --> 55:19.655
Well, I'd do it, but somebody
needs to explain to me

55:19.738 --> 55:21.824
how the whole thing works.

55:23.451 --> 55:26.454
Holy shit, he's come around.

55:26.537 --> 55:29.123
Dude!
Now it's official.

55:29.832 --> 55:31.125
[sighs]

55:32.793 --> 55:34.128
What are you guys doing?

55:36.004 --> 55:39.175
Do you really wanna make
an enemy out of MCC?

55:40.176 --> 55:42.761
You guys got yourself all riled up

55:42.845 --> 55:46.182
without really considering
what it is you're doing.

55:46.265 --> 55:47.891
We're re-unionizing.

55:47.975 --> 55:49.977
- And it feels so good.
- [Ford] Mmm-hmm.

55:50.060 --> 55:51.104
Right.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.939
What are your exact grievances?

55:54.648 --> 55:56.275
Hmm?

55:56.359 --> 55:59.903
Have you rallied at least
30% support from the employee base?

56:02.198 --> 56:04.825
Have you gotten them all
to sign authorization cards?

56:05.951 --> 56:08.662
How do you guys expect
to be taken seriously?

56:08.746 --> 56:12.291
Shit... you do know
what you're talking about.

56:13.126 --> 56:14.335
You should lead us.

56:14.418 --> 56:16.587
- That's a conflict of interest.
- Uh-uh.

56:16.670 --> 56:18.922
These corporate types
are a different breed.

56:19.006 --> 56:22.426
They're hurting us.
They're hurting our families.

56:22.510 --> 56:23.802
We need a leader.

56:25.221 --> 56:26.514
We need you, man.

56:26.597 --> 56:29.308
We do.
We need you.

56:36.607 --> 56:39.360
Well, for starters,
stop meeting in the break room.

56:39.443 --> 56:42.321
Don't give them
a reason to squash you.

56:42.405 --> 56:44.282
These guys are pros.

56:45.533 --> 56:47.160
They will call a meeting.

56:47.243 --> 56:49.495
It will seem optional,
but it won't be.

56:49.578 --> 56:51.580
And once they have you captive,

56:51.664 --> 56:53.707
they are going to feed you
a bunch of BS

56:53.791 --> 56:56.043
about it being a friendly workplace.

56:56.126 --> 57:00.047
And then they are
going to use scare tactics

57:00.130 --> 57:04.885
to try and convince you
that you're all gonna lose your jobs.

57:05.761 --> 57:07.430
Don't fucking listen to 'em.

57:07.513 --> 57:10.098
They need you
more than you need them.

57:13.977 --> 57:15.146
So, you in?

57:22.653 --> 57:23.696
I could be your guy.

57:23.779 --> 57:25.531
[all cheering]

57:28.617 --> 57:30.161
I don't know about y'all,

57:30.244 --> 57:32.538
but I feel a "Hip, hip, hooray"
coming on right about now.

57:32.621 --> 57:34.290
- Please don't. Please don't.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

57:34.373 --> 57:35.458
- No, it's coming.
- Oh, yeah!

57:35.541 --> 57:37.293
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

57:37.376 --> 57:39.002
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

57:39.086 --> 57:41.464
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

57:41.547 --> 57:42.715
