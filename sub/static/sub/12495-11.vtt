00:16.475 --> 00:17.768
What do you think

00:16.475 --> 00:17.768
of my outfit?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.145
Did your mom tell you

00:18.727 --> 00:20.145
it looked good?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.104
Yeah.

00:21.146 --> 00:21.939
She lied.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.608
She lied haaard.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.943
No.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.862
Tonight, me and Henry

00:25.985 --> 00:27.862
are going to Glow-n-Bowl.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.530
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.698
For bowling in the dark.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.533
Can I go now?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.327
No, you got to see

00:33.116 --> 00:35.327
what my outfit does.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.245
Hey, Spot, kill the lights!

Oh, hey man.

Uuhhh...

Why would you wear

01:03.271 --> 01:05.024
that in public?

01:05.858 --> 01:08.610
It's my glow-in-the-dark

bowling outfit for tonight.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.863
Ohhh, okay.

What's up?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.134
Can I ask Chloe out

01:31.550 --> 01:33.134
on a date?

01:34.093 --> 01:36.430
Ooh, here we gooo.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.475
You want to

01:38.432 --> 01:40.475
ask out Chloe?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.476
Well, yeah.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.895
I mean, come on,

01:42.937 --> 01:43.896
you haven't hung out

01:42.937 --> 01:43.896
with her in months.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.647
She's not your property.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.026
Did I say Chloe

01:47.274 --> 01:49.026
was my property?

01:49.526 --> 01:51.194
You say it with your eyes.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.321
Whatever.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.823
Yeah, sure.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.199
(chuckles)

01:54.865 --> 01:56.199
Go ahead, ask her out.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.158
I don't care.

01:57.200 --> 01:57.993
Awesome!

02:05.793 --> 02:06.794
Why are you

02:05.793 --> 02:06.794
shooting video?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.170
I thought you and Sidney

02:07.252 --> 02:09.170
were gonna fight.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.883
Maybe... you and me

02:10.589 --> 02:12.883
are gonna fight.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.344
Teacheeer!

02:16.678 --> 02:18.013
(whimpering)

02:41.286 --> 02:43.538
What?! No way!

02:41.286 --> 02:43.538
Got to go!

02:46.625 --> 02:47.793
Oh, hey, Chloe.

02:49.294 --> 02:49.920
Henry.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.339
I...

02:53.507 --> 02:54.758
Brought you

02:53.507 --> 02:54.758
this coffee mug.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.596
It says

02:57.845 --> 02:59.596
"World's Greatest Mom."

03:02.933 --> 03:05.769
No, it says

03:02.933 --> 03:05.769
"World's Greatest...

03:06.645 --> 03:07.938
Wooow."

03:11.190 --> 03:13.944
Thanks, but I don't

03:11.190 --> 03:13.944
really drink coffee.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.031
Okay...

03:18.615 --> 03:19.992
I really just wanted

03:18.615 --> 03:19.992
to talk to you.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.785
Well, there's a twist.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.995
What?

03:23.037 --> 03:24.872
You've been too busy

03:23.037 --> 03:24.872
to talk to me ever since

03:24.913 --> 03:27.415
you got a part-time job

03:24.913 --> 03:27.415
at that garbage store.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.710
It's not a garbage store.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.961
Oh, sorry. Junk.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.797
N-stuff.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.717
Come on.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.052
I'm not busy now.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.260
No, Henry.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.762
I'm not going to fall for it.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.681
Fall for what?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.475
Your "Wow" mug...

03:45.517 --> 03:46.810
The cute little smile.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.729
Aw, come ooon.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.276
Okay.

Do you want to

03:55.527 --> 03:56.695
have dinner tonight?

03:57.029 --> 03:57.696
Tonight?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.574
Uh, tonight me and Jasper

04:00.615 --> 04:01.909
Yeah, I knew it.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.162
Wait! Wait.

Ooh, lasagnaaa!

04:16.423 --> 04:17.507
I'll meet you there

04:16.423 --> 04:17.507

Yeah, you will.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.894
It all just

04:27.559 --> 04:28.894
kind of happened.

My dad was

04:28.936 --> 04:31.063
an irresponsible scientist.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
I wanted

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
an afterschool job.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.191
(Captain Man)

04:33.023 --> 04:34.191
And by accident...

04:34.524 --> 04:36.110
he made me

04:34.524 --> 04:36.110
indestructible.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.318
Ahhh!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
(Henry)

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
I went to

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
this crazy store

04:39.738 --> 04:41.364
and met

04:39.738 --> 04:41.364
a pretty interesting guy.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
I'm going to

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
blow your mind.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.786
(Captain Man)

04:43.075 --> 04:45.786
Now I protect the good

04:43.075 --> 04:45.786
citizens of Swellview.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.703
Who call me...

04:46.745 --> 04:47.788
(Henry)

04:46.745 --> 04:47.788
He turned out to be...

04:47.829 --> 04:48.956
(Captain Man)

04:47.829 --> 04:48.956
You know the name.

04:48.997 --> 04:49.873
Captain Man!

04:49.915 --> 04:51.166
That's right, Henry.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.877
In time, I realized that

04:51.208 --> 04:53.877
being a superhero

04:53.919 --> 04:55.336
is a lot to handle alone.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.588
He wanted some help.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.547
(Captain Man)

04:56.630 --> 04:57.547
I needed a sidekick.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.382
I, Henry Hart...

04:59.424 --> 05:00.801
(Captain Man)

04:59.424 --> 05:00.801
Pledge to never ever

04:59.424 --> 05:00.801
ever tell anyone...

05:00.842 --> 05:02.094
That I'm Captain Man's

05:00.842 --> 05:02.094
secret sidekick.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.178
(Captain Man)

05:02.136 --> 05:03.178
It is done.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.387
(Henry)

05:03.220 --> 05:04.387
Now we blow bubbles.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.847

And fight crime.

we have to organize

the stupid storage room?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.468
Shouldn't Ray be doing this?

05:43.718 --> 05:45.012
I don't know.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.513
Just tell me what that is

05:45.053 --> 05:46.513
so I can write it down.

05:47.139 --> 05:47.806
Uh...

Ray said not to mess

with this stuff.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.494
I wasn't messing with it.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.704
I just leaned on it--

06:11.246 --> 06:11.913
You're wrong.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.706
I told you that--

06:12.747 --> 06:13.957
- Give it up, Schwoz!

It's not, there's an--

Well, I told you wrong.

06:18.045 --> 06:18.920
(Schwoz)

06:18.045 --> 06:18.920
The answer is soup.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.297
Well, I disagree.

06:20.839 --> 06:21.965
Okay, let's ask them.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.050
Ask us what?

I know, but...

It's not a date.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.641
Ooh, Sotto Voce.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.019
(laughs) How can you afford

07:13.683 --> 07:16.019
a place like that?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.146
Because I took 100 bucks

07:16.061 --> 07:18.146
out of your wallet.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.190
What?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.066
Up the tube!

07:26.821 --> 07:27.614
Hey.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.907
What is this machine?

07:28.949 --> 07:29.866
Did I make this?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.827
No, my father made that.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.827
Long time ago.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.246
What this do?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.249
Well, it was supposed

07:34.829 --> 07:37.249
to make me stronger,

07:37.291 --> 07:38.499
more powerful,

07:37.291 --> 07:38.499
you know,

07:38.750 --> 07:39.459
manlier.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.420
So it didn't work.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.714
It was never tested on me.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.217
We tested it

07:45.382 --> 07:47.217
on my nerdy cousin.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.676
So, did it make him manly?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
It made him too manly.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.638
Ooh.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.473
The effects started

07:52.347 --> 07:53.473
off slowly but...

07:54.141 --> 07:56.017
(sighs)

07:54.141 --> 07:56.017
a few days later

07:54.141 --> 07:56.017
he was...

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
less of a man.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.228
Oh?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.063
More of a beast.

08:00.105 --> 08:00.730
Oh!

08:04.109 --> 08:07.362
(grunting)

08:09.030 --> 08:10.240
(Henry)

08:09.030 --> 08:10.240
Hey. Hey!

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
Did I say you could

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
come in my room?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.035
Did I ask?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.122
I just need a pair of scissors

08:14.869 --> 08:17.122
to open my new phone case.

08:17.164 --> 08:17.998
Here, just give it.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.336
Gross, don't use your teeth.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.338
(grunts)

08:30.551 --> 08:31.761
Here's your phone case.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.974
Well, now your hand is

08:33.638 --> 08:35.974
bleeding.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.435
Oh. Yeah.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.814
Tastes good.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.650
Gross.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.650
What's up with you?

08:45.692 --> 08:46.693
Nothing.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.111
Now, get out of my room.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.988
I got to finish

08:48.528 --> 08:49.988
my workout.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.199
I got plans tonight.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.742
(grunts)

08:55.702 --> 08:56.328
Whoa!

08:57.329 --> 08:59.498
When did you grow

08:57.329 --> 08:59.498
those furballs under your arms?

09:00.499 --> 09:01.249
Huh?

09:02.083 --> 09:02.834
Oh.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.294
I don't know.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.920
But I like them.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.923
(grunting)

09:18.350 --> 09:20.101
(Charlotte screaming)

09:21.061 --> 09:22.187
(elevator dings)

09:29.486 --> 09:30.404
Here's your coffee.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.781
Thank you?

09:39.829 --> 09:40.830
(Schwoz)

09:39.829 --> 09:40.830
So...

09:41.415 --> 09:43.124
What we gonna do

09:41.415 --> 09:43.124
with this manly machine?

09:44.834 --> 09:45.585
Oh, yeah.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.295
That thing is

09:46.211 --> 09:47.295
majorly dangerous.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.338
We better destroy it.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.965
Or I guess we could

09:48.880 --> 09:50.965
donate it to a school.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.468
Hey...

09:53.510 --> 09:54.928
What do you mean

09:53.510 --> 09:54.928
that thing is dangerous?

09:54.969 --> 09:57.722
Well, it was designed

09:54.969 --> 09:57.722
to make people stronger,

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
more powerful,

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
and manlier but

09:59.849 --> 10:00.934
it goes too far.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.144
Take a look at what it did

10:01.184 --> 10:03.144
to my cousin Elliot.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.523
Ew.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.316
No, that's a

10:07.315 --> 10:08.316
before picture.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.402
Oh.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.486
Here's what Elliot looked

10:10.444 --> 10:11.486
like a week after my dad

10:11.528 --> 10:12.946
tested this machine

10:11.528 --> 10:12.946
on him.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.532
Yah!

10:15.574 --> 10:16.491
Yep.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.452
He turned into

10:16.533 --> 10:18.452
a man-beast.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.703
He looks like

10:19.369 --> 10:20.703
my sister.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.790
Ha!

10:21.996 --> 10:23.790
Your sister wishes.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.584
She is an animal.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.626
(laughing)

10:27.001 --> 10:28.878
She smells

10:27.001 --> 10:28.878
like a horse.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.505
Guys!

10:31.298 --> 10:32.549
You guys!

10:32.591 --> 10:33.758
What?

10:32.591 --> 10:33.758
Yeah?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
Henry accidentally touched

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
that machine.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.430
He... He turned it on?

10:38.472 --> 10:39.722
He didn't mean to.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.558
His hand just hit

10:39.764 --> 10:41.558
one of those buttons

10:41.600 --> 10:44.561
and it went all...

10:41.600 --> 10:44.561
Bzz... Bzz.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.272
Uh-oh.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
Did you see Henry start

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
to show any signs of...

10:50.275 --> 10:51.610
exaggerated manliness?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.236
I'm...

10:52.068 --> 10:53.236
I'm not sure.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.195
Well, where is he?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.281
He's having dinner

10:54.904 --> 10:56.281
with a girl at Sotto Voce.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.407
Oh, right.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.658
I hear they have

10:57.449 --> 10:58.658
good paninis.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.867
Oh, shut up, Schwoz.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.329
I got to go get Henry

11:00.827 --> 11:02.329
before the symptoms

11:02.370 --> 11:03.955
advance too far

11:02.370 --> 11:03.955
and they become permanent.

11:03.997 --> 11:04.998
Come with me.

11:05.039 --> 11:05.665
Okay.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.127
(electronic beeping)

11:10.337 --> 11:11.212
Bye!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.172
Up the tube!

11:12.213 --> 11:13.006
Buh-bye.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.219
I really should

11:16.426 --> 11:18.219
call my sister...

11:18.553 --> 11:20.263
A horse.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.764
(laughs)

11:25.977 --> 11:28.813
(jazzy tune playing)

11:32.442 --> 11:33.360
Oh, excuse me.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.986
Ohh, no!

11:35.320 --> 11:36.904
I will not excuse you.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.449
I'm sorry, I didn't mean

11:38.072 --> 11:39.449
to bump into you,

11:39.491 --> 11:40.241
I was just passing--

11:40.283 --> 11:41.117
What?!

11:41.660 --> 11:42.910
You want to swing at me?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.037
Come on!

11:44.078 --> 11:44.787
Let's go, Mark.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.873
Yeah... go Mark.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.708
Enjoy your salad.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.005
Hey Henry.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.674
Ohh, hey,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.674
what's up, dude?

11:57.634 --> 11:58.885
Uh... Is that...

11:59.760 --> 12:01.596
Are you growing a beard?

12:02.263 --> 12:02.930
Huh?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.641
Huh. Nah.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.892
I think

12:04.683 --> 12:05.892
I just need a shave.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.061
Wow.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.061
When did you start shaving?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.979
I guess

12:08.102 --> 12:09.979
tomorrow morning, ha!

12:10.397 --> 12:11.189
Hey!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.065
(hits counter)

12:12.106 --> 12:13.233
Let's get us a table!

12:13.274 --> 12:15.443
We hungryyy!

12:16.319 --> 12:18.737
Young man,

12:16.319 --> 12:18.737
this is Sotto Voce,

12:18.779 --> 12:20.490
would you please

12:18.779 --> 12:20.490
lower your voice?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.617
Yeah, I'll lower my voice.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.495
We hungryyyy!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.456
(laughing)

12:29.207 --> 12:29.916
Yeah!

12:30.333 --> 12:33.086
We going to get fooood!

12:39.217 --> 12:40.009
(door knock)

12:40.677 --> 12:41.928
Hey, Piper.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.179
Ugh, I'll call you back.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.600
What do you think of my cool

12:44.514 --> 12:46.600
bowling outfit?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.726
It glows in the dark.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.645
You know, just because

12:48.643 --> 12:50.645
you're friends with my brother,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.647
that doesn't mean

12:50.937 --> 12:52.647
we have to talk.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.649
Okay.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.150
Then just tell Henry

12:55.233 --> 12:56.150
I'm here.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.569
Henry's gone.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.987
He can't be gone.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.987
We have plans.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.364
Well, he got better plans.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.575
With who?

13:03.866 --> 13:04.743
I don't know, some chick.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.078
He took her

13:05.159 --> 13:07.078
to dinner at Sotto Voce.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.455
Sotto Voce...

13:09.372 --> 13:10.081
Yep.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.459
Okay, well...

13:13.543 --> 13:14.877
I guess I'll just

13:13.543 --> 13:14.877
go home then.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.922
What?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.048
You had plans with Henry

13:19.382 --> 13:21.259
and he blew you off,

13:19.382 --> 13:21.259
and you're just going to be all,

13:21.509 --> 13:24.053
"oh, I guess

13:21.509 --> 13:24.053
I'll just go home then"?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.598
What should I do?

13:26.889 --> 13:29.100
I don't know,

13:26.889 --> 13:29.100
be a man?

13:29.601 --> 13:30.935
But--

13:30.977 --> 13:32.186
If I were you,

13:30.977 --> 13:32.186
I'd ride my bike

13:32.228 --> 13:33.730
right over to Sotto Voce,

13:33.772 --> 13:36.316
march in there, tell Henry

13:33.772 --> 13:36.316
that he's rude,

13:36.357 --> 13:39.068
and then I'd shove his face down

13:36.357 --> 13:39.068
right into his food.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.279
Yeah.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.740
I should teach him

13:42.196 --> 13:43.740
a lesson.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.991
Yeah, you should.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.160
Now, get out of here,

13:45.241 --> 13:47.160
you make me sick.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.081
I should be a life coach.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.922
And lasagna

13:58.004 --> 13:59.922
for the young lady.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.966
Oh my god,

14:00.340 --> 14:01.966
it smells so good.

14:02.008 --> 14:02.841
(sniffing)

14:02.883 --> 14:05.052
Yeah! Smell that!

14:06.721 --> 14:09.724
And, um, are you sure

14:06.721 --> 14:09.724
you want your steak raw?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.185
Yeah, man,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.185
just set it down, yeah.

14:12.811 --> 14:13.687
Thanks.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.021
I don't need this.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.105
Okay.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.190
Enjoy.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.860
(sniffing)

14:20.901 --> 14:22.529
Oh, yeah, smell that.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.503
Hey, Henry!

14:38.753 --> 14:40.213
Remember this guy?

14:40.714 --> 14:41.840
Bye, Jasper.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.635
(Piper's voice)

14:43.132 --> 14:45.635
"If I were you,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.635
I'd tell Henry that he's rude,

14:45.677 --> 14:48.346
and then I'd shove his face down

14:45.677 --> 14:48.346
right into his food."

14:50.097 --> 14:51.098
What are you

14:50.097 --> 14:51.098
thinking about?

14:51.932 --> 14:52.726
Your sister.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.934
What?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.103
Now I'm going

14:54.561 --> 14:56.103
to teach you a lesson.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.693
(both grunting)

15:03.528 --> 15:05.279
Are you trying

15:03.528 --> 15:05.279
to push his head down?

15:05.321 --> 15:06.280
Yeah, what are you doing?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.214
You just

15:21.421 --> 15:23.214
beef-slapped me.

15:23.882 --> 15:24.674
You want some more?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.300
Henry!

15:26.342 --> 15:27.635
You're...

15:26.342 --> 15:27.635
You're acting weird!

15:29.970 --> 15:31.305
Bye, Jasper!

15:31.598 --> 15:32.557
(Jasper in the distance)

15:31.598 --> 15:32.557
Byeee!

15:33.391 --> 15:34.100
Woo!

15:34.350 --> 15:36.269
Is it hot in here?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.744
Whoa,

15:50.784 --> 15:52.744
look at Henry's beard.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.622
I knew it.

15:56.539 --> 15:57.791
It's the effects

15:56.539 --> 15:57.791
of that device.

15:58.124 --> 15:58.999
Henr's changing.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.710
If we don't do something

15:59.333 --> 16:00.710
quickly,

16:00.960 --> 16:03.546
in a few more days

16:00.960 --> 16:03.546
he could be a full-on man-beast.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.633
Why can't we ever have

16:04.756 --> 16:06.633
normal problems?

16:07.425 --> 16:08.217
Go get Henry.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.010
Make up some reason

16:08.843 --> 16:10.010
why he's got to leave with you.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.345
(laughs)

16:13.807 --> 16:14.808
Go get him.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.808
What's the problem?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.267
I feel bad.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.478
Henry really likes Chloe

16:16.309 --> 16:18.478
and she's already mad at him.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.395
Why?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.605
Because he keeps

16:19.437 --> 16:20.605
flaking on her

16:20.647 --> 16:23.065
because he's always busy

16:20.647 --> 16:23.065
working for you.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.525
Okay.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.694
All right.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.947
I know how to get Henry

16:27.445 --> 16:28.947
out of here

16:28.988 --> 16:30.531
without Chloe

16:28.988 --> 16:30.531
thinking it's his fault.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.574
What are you going to do?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.004
Wait here.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.216
Well, I'm taking these mints.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.273
(screaming)

17:05.608 --> 17:06.985
Fire!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.736
Quick, everyone,

17:07.026 --> 17:08.736
exit the restaurant!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.029
Captain Man?

17:10.070 --> 17:10.905
Wow.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.073
Sir, you are

17:11.447 --> 17:13.073
at sotto voce.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.659
Please lower your voice.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.827
Sorry. Sorry.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.037
(whispering) Fire.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.037
Please keep your voices down

17:18.078 --> 17:19.163
and exit the restaurant.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.123
Fire.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.249
Please keep your voices down

17:21.165 --> 17:22.249
and exit the restaurant.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.668
Fire.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.004
Please keep your voices down

17:23.710 --> 17:26.004
and exit the restaurant.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.296
Fire don't scare me.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.173
Well, fire do scare me.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.926
(Chloe)

17:30.591 --> 17:31.926
Thanks for coming.

17:31.968 --> 17:32.635
We're out of mints.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.220
Appreciate your business.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.429
Get out...

17:37.891 --> 17:39.350
(grunting)

17:41.143 --> 17:42.520
Nuh-uh, dude.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.023
You're going to have to zap me

17:43.062 --> 17:45.023
harder than that.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.068
Come on, kid,

17:47.817 --> 17:49.068
I'm trying to help you.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.069
Just drop.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.445
Sorry.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.865
Three little laser shots

17:52.071 --> 17:53.865
can't hurt me.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.037
Ohhh, that did it.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.210
Ooh, panini.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.467
(growling)

18:13.927 --> 18:14.635
Let me go!

18:17.263 --> 18:19.015
Can we please hurry up

18:17.263 --> 18:19.015
and get this done?

18:19.057 --> 18:21.100
It is ready.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.100
Pick up the meat-beef.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.562
(growling)

18:25.730 --> 18:27.899
(growls loudly)

18:27.941 --> 18:29.191
Throw the meat-beef!

18:35.782 --> 18:36.657
What happens now?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.576
What that machine

18:37.033 --> 18:38.576
did to Henry,

18:38.826 --> 18:40.327
this machine do the opposite.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.287
(Henry growling)

18:41.328 --> 18:42.038
Hurry!

18:42.371 --> 18:43.289
I go speedy.

18:44.248 --> 18:48.502
(Henry growling

18:44.248 --> 18:48.502
and breathing heavily)

18:50.546 --> 18:53.091
(Henry snarling loudly)

19:02.850 --> 19:04.685
(whirring)

19:08.314 --> 19:09.107
Open.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.075
What happened?

19:19.117 --> 19:20.118
I feel so...

19:21.619 --> 19:22.662
Different.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.338
I need to make

19:30.628 --> 19:32.338
some adjustments.

19:39.887 --> 19:40.972
(knocking)

19:45.143 --> 19:45.977
Hey.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.478
Why did you want me

19:46.226 --> 19:47.478
to come over?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.604
Because...

19:49.271 --> 19:51.774
I feel bad about how our dinner

19:49.271 --> 19:51.774
went at Sotto Voce.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.233
Aw, why would you

19:51.816 --> 19:53.233
feel bad?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.819
Just because you acted

19:53.275 --> 19:54.819
like an animal

19:55.402 --> 19:58.447
and then ditched me after

19:55.402 --> 19:58.447
the restaurant caught on fire?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.701
Will you please just come in

19:59.866 --> 20:01.701
and let me talk to you?

20:03.828 --> 20:04.871
Here, I got you.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.621
I don't need help.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.580
Just come here.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.707
Okay.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.707
Yeah, I got it.

20:07.748 --> 20:08.666
Just, just

20:07.748 --> 20:08.666
sit right here.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.667
All right.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.667
I know where to sit.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.088
Okay. Talk to me.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.257
I, uh...

20:18.843 --> 20:20.761
The reason I acted all crazy

20:18.843 --> 20:20.761
at the restaurant...

20:21.470 --> 20:22.096
Yeah?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.766
See...

20:22.722 --> 20:25.766
I had a weird reaction

20:26.266 --> 20:27.685
to this special medicine,

20:28.853 --> 20:30.771
these pills

20:28.853 --> 20:30.771
I take for my...

20:32.106 --> 20:33.024
My feet.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.569
Why do you take pills

20:34.859 --> 20:36.569
for your feet?

20:37.028 --> 20:38.571
Because I have...

20:39.780 --> 20:42.366
Feetal Fungal Syndrome.

20:44.994 --> 20:45.828
FFS.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.371
FFS?

20:48.956 --> 20:49.999
That's,

20:48.956 --> 20:49.999
that's really a thing?

20:50.041 --> 20:51.625
Yeah,

20:50.041 --> 20:51.625
but don't look it up.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.130
Okay. So, now?

20:56.797 --> 20:57.757
Oh, I'm fine now

20:58.174 --> 20:59.926
because I went to see

21:00.968 --> 21:02.428
Dr. Schwozberg.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.014
See?

21:05.056 --> 21:05.890
Feel my face.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.142
No hair.

21:09.852 --> 21:10.770
And look.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.313
Smooooth.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.358
(imitating Henry's voice)

21:14.565 --> 21:16.358
Looks gooood.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.195
Hey.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.573
I'm really sorry

21:19.946 --> 21:22.573
that I wrecked our dinner.

21:24.992 --> 21:25.785
Anyway...

21:26.160 --> 21:27.161
To make it up to you...

21:29.205 --> 21:31.290
♪ Sorry that I let you down ♪♪

21:35.419 --> 21:36.712
You want to have dinner

21:35.419 --> 21:36.712
with me?

21:38.714 --> 21:39.548
Yeah, okay.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.219
It's meee!

21:43.261 --> 21:44.220
(Henry)

21:43.261 --> 21:44.220
Jasper?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.013
What are you doing here?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.056
Guess where I've been?

21:47.473 --> 21:48.474
The supermarket.

21:48.975 --> 21:49.934
Guess what I bought?

21:51.393 --> 21:52.228
This meat.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.688
Look,

21:53.104 --> 21:54.688
I'm really sorry that--

22:01.028 --> 22:02.947
You just got

22:01.028 --> 22:02.947
beef-slapped.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.324
Haaard.

22:33.311 --> 22:33.978
(oven bell dings)

22:34.020 --> 22:34.854
(Man)

22:34.020 --> 22:34.854
Mmm...
