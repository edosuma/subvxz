00:07.640 --> 00:11.280
Do you think any of this actually raises
awareness or creates change?

00:11.400 --> 00:12.960
It won't even make the 10:00 news.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.960
Shouldn't we be doing stuff
that will make the news, then?

00:16.080 --> 00:19.840
What if I said we could switch every
traffic light to red simultaneously

00:19.960 --> 00:22.080
within a two-mile radius of Temple?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
Can we?

00:23.320 --> 00:25.480
Basically involves
just pulling out a few wires.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.840
This is the foremost equestrian
medical center in the country.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.240
Dermot?

00:31.480 --> 00:33.360
See you later, Daniel Milton.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.080
We're through.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.240
Look, you're not getting out of there.
It's bombproof.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.200
Gubby, I need a favour.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.560
What if this guy wants a favour back?
Why put yourself in that position?

00:49.360 --> 00:51.520
For you. It was for you.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.280
Dad, I'm at the police station.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.440
I think they're going
to charge me with murder.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.200
Get some sleep.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.800
Get off the road.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.600
You were the last known person
to see Sergeant Moloney alive, Eve.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.800
You're on camera stuffing a bin full
of his possessions and bloody towels.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.880
Why?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.800
Who are you protecting?

02:05.160 --> 02:08.000
Hopes are fading
for the 20-foot bottlenose whale

02:08.120 --> 02:09.680
trapped in the River Thames.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.920
Out of its depth, disorientated,
and battling against the tides,

02:13.040 --> 02:14.960
it's chances
of survival are slim.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.600
Daniel James Milton.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.760
- Daniel James Milton.
- Yes, that's me.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
Can I see her?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.360
Just had a note from them to say she's
still in processing,

02:25.480 --> 02:27.600
so we'll be in touch as and when.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.400
Eve. Eve, I'm gonna sort this out.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.760
- Dad, please.
- I'm going to fix it. I promise you.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.880
- Who are you?
- I'm her father.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.280
Well, in that case, do you mind waiting?
We might have some questions for you.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.200
I'll be back in a minute.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.560
I come with respect to appeal
to your better nature.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.160
And to give you fair warning
that I'm about to do something

04:54.280 --> 04:59.560
which may have a degree
of blowback in your direction.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.320
I need to hand myself into the police.
Over...

05:07.640 --> 05:08.760
Over the...

05:09.920 --> 05:12.640
dead body that you
kindly picked up for me.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.960
Do not mention dead bodies
in front of my son.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.840
He's at a very impressionable age.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.640
They've arrested my daughter.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.360
I need to get in front of this
by going to the police myself.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.520
So what are you gonna do
when they ask to see the body?

05:47.880 --> 05:50.960
That's the thing. That's why I'm here.
I need the body back.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.360
Well, now I do feel misled.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.640
Whatever happened to
coming here out of respect?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.920
Wait here, please.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.080
Leave.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.160
Let's imagine, even for a minute,
that I said yes.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.160
Why do you think that puts
your daughter in the clear?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.320
Because they could run ballistics
from the head wound

06:28.440 --> 06:31.920
and they could work out where the gun
that caused it was fired from,

06:32.040 --> 06:33.840
which would get my daughter
off the hook.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.680
Well, that's optimistic.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.480
With respect, it would be the proof
of what actually happened.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.240
Sit down.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.360
If it's entered my organisation,

06:54.520 --> 06:57.160
it exposes my organisation to risk,

06:57.640 --> 06:59.200
which I cannot have.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.360
Meaning you can't have the body.

07:04.520 --> 07:08.080
I can't blame you for trying.
I'm a father myself, after all.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.720
It's a good job, you're useful,
Mr. Milton.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.840
Well, how'd you get on?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.080
We're gonna need to steal the body back.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.400
- We?
- Yeah.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.880
We, Daniel?

07:37.840 --> 07:41.720
Right. A, that's a shit idea, and B, I
have somewhere else I need to be today.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.640
Somewhere else to be?
Look at the situation.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.600
I can see the situation, Daniel.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.800
Look, sorry I'm not around
to play bloody Igor today,

07:50.920 --> 07:53.600
but I have somewhere
I told someone I'd be.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.440
But I need you here.
This is about, Eve.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.600
I have somewhere else I need to be.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.920
I can't do it without help.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.840
Please, Lee.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.840
An hour.
Right, you have one hour.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.760
- All right, where are we going?
- Drive. I'll figure it out on the way.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.480
I mean, how many horse hospitals
can there be?

08:42.440 --> 08:44.160
Doors open.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.240
- Hi
- Hello, again.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.120
Lovely to have you back.
And so soon.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.360
Not too soon for comfort, I hope.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.240
Not at all. I'm excited to hear
you wanted to discuss.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.680
I've had a breakthrough.
On the testing with Lancasters.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.320
How?

09:03.360 --> 09:04.600
How positive?

09:05.400 --> 09:07.640
Quite. Very, in fact.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.720
Come with me, please.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.000
I think you two should talk.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.120
- Go hide.
- Shit.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.720
Go, go, go.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.960
What are you doing here?

10:26.040 --> 10:28.080
Well, I'm looking for you.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.560
So who told you I was here?

10:31.080 --> 10:34.120
- I've spoken to Gubby.
- Yeah, I heard that.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.520
Tell you what, we'll have
a wee tete-a-tete across there.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.640
It's a bit Ascot Chain Saw Massacre
in there.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.200
I know you're responsible
for finishing the treatment.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.640
But what you did
was only part of it.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.920
The main body of it was my work.
Years of my work.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.880
I worked pretty hard, too.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.280
Yeah, I know.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.720
And I know what you did
saved my life.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.680
In spite of what you think now,
I am incredibly grateful.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.560
And so, when it comes
to the research,

11:41.280 --> 11:43.800
I could live with sharing it.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.080
We could work on it together.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.600
- What about Daniel?
- Daniel and me are over.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.120
That was finished a long time ago.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.440
So?

12:01.360 --> 12:02.840
What do you think?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.640
Not a chance.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.240
But you're not saying
the body isn't here.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.800
I mean, it isn't, but whether it is
or not, it's not the point.

12:14.880 --> 12:19.320
The heart of the matter is
Gubby told you no.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.480
Just tell me.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.920
- Have you burnt it?
- I would like to help you, Daniel.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.360
But it'll be my balls,
I'm not being clever about it, either.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.960
Look, Gubby and I get on all right,
and he trusts me.

12:33.720 --> 12:39.520
But it would be my actual balls
fed through a mangle, like a wet gym kit.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.360
Yes.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.960
Now, it's not like I like
saying no to you.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.080
But see it from
my position, will you?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.560
FOUD BODY

13:15.280 --> 13:19.760
Sure. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to come
down here and lay this on you.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.880
Yeah, it's all right.
Desperate times and all that.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.880
Shall we say no more about it?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.280
- Especially to himself.
- Right.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.440
Listen, the least I can do
is give you a proper drink.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.680
- You look like you could do with one.
- No, no. Not for me, thanks.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.880
Don't play the Boy Scout.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.560
Got a lovely drop of Irish whiskey
in there. Come on.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.440
Can we delay?
Like, for an hour or so?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.000
No.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.520
Ash, please, listen. I just need...

14:03.640 --> 14:07.200
I don't know what's gotten into you,
but there is no chance of a delay, Lee.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.600
We're here. We're in place.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.560
Please, Ash.
Look, I can't go into it now.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.480
But we might have to delay
until I can get under...

14:17.600 --> 14:19.040
...ground.

14:19.320 --> 14:23.520
I would normally join you,
but I'm under orders.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.760
You know, doctor's.
And Gubby's. Have to cut back.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.400
Dermot, I can't see that
helping anything.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.880
Although
I'm sure a drop wouldn't hurt.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.120
Oh, yeah, that's more like it.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.920
Could I get some water in there?

14:46.440 --> 14:50.600
And here's me thinking these English
boys weren't sophisticated, huh?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.880
There you go.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.920
Don't just stare at it.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.720
Could I...
Could I use your bathroom?

15:32.920 --> 15:36.600
- Yes, sure. It's second on your right.
- Thanks.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.840
Fuck you, Dermot!

16:08.480 --> 16:09.600
Daniel?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.240
Get the van.
Let's get the hell out of here.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.800
- What? What is it?
- It's the whole body.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.120
Oi!

16:22.320 --> 16:23.840
What the fuck's this?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.040
What do you think
you're taking me for?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.360
What's wrong with him?
What's he doing?

16:37.880 --> 16:38.960
Don't worry about it.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.520
First glance, how was I supposed to
know it didn't match the description?

16:42.640 --> 16:45.440
- I shouldn't even fucking be here.
- Excuse me?

16:46.240 --> 16:50.880
Have you any idea
whose toes you're dancing on?

16:52.760 --> 16:54.880
'Cause let me
tell you something.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.520
You're fucked.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.600
We've called you a duty solicitor.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.680
If you feel more comfortable
once they've arrived,

17:09.840 --> 17:13.520
I'd love to hear something
more meaningful from you, Eve.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.920
Cup of tea, Len?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.240
Oh, lovely, yeah.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.880
Make us both a cup
while you're up there, would ya?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.600
Rob was onto something.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.960
Something going on
under Temple Station.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.240
Lo and behold,
you work for the fucking tunnels,

17:48.680 --> 17:51.000
so I know that you know something.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.400
Tell me.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.760
Things I know about you, Eve.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.120
Got a folder full of you here.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.080
Attacked another girl
at uni last semester, right?

18:09.200 --> 18:10.920
Now, I bet I can get the judge
to take that into account.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.080
You don't know anything
about me.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.560
I've got nothing to say to you.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.840
Well, top marks for spirit,
but we're in here all alone.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.360
And I'm getting it out of you
one way or the other.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.960
Is that a threat?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.360
You're going to prison.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.440
A woman twice your age and twice your
size is going to own every inch of you

18:37.560 --> 18:40.320
and it's going to be freaking horrible.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.720
How long would you like me
to send you there for?

18:47.120 --> 18:49.280
Just where is the freaking body?

18:49.400 --> 18:54.800
You're struggling. Do you want me
to push you in a warmer direction?

18:56.760 --> 18:57.960
I swear I can't

18:58.080 --> 19:03.920
because you've hit me up
with enough ketamine buckle a yak.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.960
Use your words, then, Dermot!

19:07.320 --> 19:09.800
He's not just gonna
come for you, you know.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.880
Lee?

19:23.240 --> 19:25.720
All right, talk me through
your plan again.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.400
I hand myself in to the police,
they run tests on the body

19:28.520 --> 19:30.360
and conclude Eve didn't kill him.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.520
So first we go to the bunker.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.080
"Bunker"? What do you mean
by "bunker"?

19:37.600 --> 19:41.080
They'll have to run ballistics, won't
they? From where the shot was fired.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.520
All right, so, hang on, are you...

19:44.840 --> 19:48.880
Are you seriously saying you might
have to give up the freaking bunker?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.480
What's that mean for me?

19:56.040 --> 19:57.600
What are you doing?
Come on, we need to keep moving.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.000
Not that, Daniel.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.520
- What would that mean for me?
- What do you expect?

20:02.640 --> 20:06.520
There's no cunning plan here. We just
have to give them what they want.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
We?

20:08.160 --> 20:10.520
-Lee, please.
-You begged me.

20:11.240 --> 20:15.280
Yeah? I didn't realize that meant helping
you dig my own fucking grave.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.360
Do you realize what they'll throw at me
for the stuff we've done in there?

20:18.480 --> 20:21.800
Have you given that
even a bloody second?

20:22.720 --> 20:27.200
One word from you and here I am.
Yes, sir, no, sir, like some bloody mug.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.520
- I'm taking the van.
- No.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.280
So best of luck to you, mate.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.680
- You're gonna need it.
- No, you can't leave me like this.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.800
Where are you going?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.440
I told you I had somewhere else
I had to be.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.960
Jesus Christ!
I must have told you a hundred times!

20:47.880 --> 20:51.440
But you don't hear it
because you basically don't care.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.880
You're happy if it gets me killed
if it suits your end,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.120
so when am I gonna learn that lesson?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.520
Lee, this isn't important.
This is about Eve.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
It's not, though, is it, about Eve?

21:03.240 --> 21:04.400
It's you.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.080
It's always you,
you selfish fucking prick!

21:35.240 --> 21:37.880
When Gubby cottons on
to what you're up to,

21:38.360 --> 21:41.280
he's gonna come at you
with everything he's got.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
Yes?

21:59.320 --> 22:03.400
- Gubby, It's me. I'm taking the body.
- Is that right?

22:04.200 --> 22:07.720
I'm going ahead with that thing I told you
I was going ahead with.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.640
You've left me no choice.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.240
You've got some balls on you.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.720
You're dead.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.120
- Ok, let's discuss the matter at hand.
- There's nothing to discuss.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.000
Why don't we go over
your options first, Daniel?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.360
What options?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.040
Oh, God.

23:08.880 --> 23:09.880
Hello.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.640
Promise me
you're not gonna freak out, okay?

23:12.760 --> 23:14.360
What's the matter?
Is everything okay?

23:14.480 --> 23:17.040
- Yeah, no. I'm gonna work with Beth.
- What?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.360
She asked me to join her team.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.040
Now, look, I know it's weird because
of us, but I really feel that...

23:25.320 --> 23:26.840
It's everything you want.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.840
Well, it's almost
everything I want.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.880
How was your day? Like, did everything
go okay with... You know?

23:37.920 --> 23:40.160
-  Daniel?
- I love you, Anna.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.320
I love you, too.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.200
Can you just come and see me tonight?
It doesn't matter what time it is.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.120
I just really wanna see you.

23:49.240 --> 23:53.360
My cab's here, sorry.I'll talk to
you later, okay?Bye, bye, bye.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.200
The bottlenose whale
that was trapped in the Thames

24:16.320 --> 24:17.800
seems to have disappeared.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.040
Marine experts fear the whale may have
drowned in the tidal estuary,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.600
a valiant fight that makes
its final surrender

24:24.720 --> 24:28.120
to the murky undercurrents
of London all the more...

24:34.920 --> 24:36.280
Hey, Siri.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.000
Call Beth.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.960
So have you spoken to her?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.040
- I... I haven't had a chance.
- Oh, God!

25:07.280 --> 25:09.760
How? How, Daniel?
How are you gonna fix this?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.320
I need you to go
to the police station now.

25:13.560 --> 25:17.000
In what world do you think you still get
to ask me for anything?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.760
Tell her to lead them
to me in the bunker.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.680
I'll meet them.
I'll put things right from there.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.880
No, you're playing games again.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.680
No games.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.840
Well, then, walk in there
right now and confess.

25:31.040 --> 25:36.000
I can't. I... I need to clear things up
first before they get...

25:36.120 --> 25:39.680
Oh, Jesus! You're unbelievable.
And whose freaking car is this?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.480
Oh, Jesus!
Beth, I'm trying to do the right thing.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.800
What, a dead fucking policeman?

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
I don't care.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.760
I don't care to hear anything
you have to say in your own interest.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.280
From now on, what happens to you
is no concern of mine.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.960
One of us has to look after
our daughter.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.400
So will you do it, please?

26:07.360 --> 26:08.760
For Eve.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.360
Oh, God, I can't believe
I wasted 25 years on you.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.320
Look, you need to call this, Ash.
Are we doing it?

26:30.440 --> 26:31.800
Well, we aren't.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.080
I can't believe
that he's bloody done this to us.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
Why isn't he down there?

27:42.880 --> 27:44.240
Oh, come on.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.240
Red, blue...

28:14.040 --> 28:15.600
Red.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.680
I think we have to call it
for what it is, guys.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.960
Get the drone.
Get the freaking drone.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.520
Look at me, Eve.
Look at me.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.320
You need to think about yourself here,
no one else, do you understand me?

29:43.440 --> 29:46.160
Eve, it's time to come clean
about your father.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.400
You have to show them
to the bunker.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.840
Let's go, let's go. Come on.
On your checks.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.920
We bring you breaking news.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.760
We just received
this drone footage

32:22.880 --> 32:25.200
sent to usby a climate change
activist group

32:25.320 --> 32:28.280
who have brought inner London
to a grinding standstill

32:28.400 --> 32:32.240
by changing traffic lights to red,
causing total disruption.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.600
This radical action

32:33.720 --> 32:36.720
is the latest in a series of
coordinated events across London...

32:36.920 --> 32:39.800
Lee?
What the hell are you doing here?

32:56.800 --> 32:58.120
Clear.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.000
In here!

33:15.880 --> 33:17.960
London Police.
Don't move.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.360
Hands in the air.
Let me see your hands.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.280
Keep 'em steady.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.480
Dr. Milton.

33:32.120 --> 33:36.080
- Eve has nothing to do with any of this.
- Where's Sergeant Moloney?

33:36.920 --> 33:40.400
- First, I want to hear you acknowledge...
- This isn't a freaking dialogue, sir.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.520
Where's Rob?

33:44.560 --> 33:46.200
He's through there.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.440
You two, over there.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.240
I'll show you.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.560
I don't know how he found this place.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.680
After he got in, I locked him in here,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.040
but he tried to shoot his way out
through the door

34:53.160 --> 34:55.840
and the ricochet caught him in the head.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.000
Move.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.040
I know this sounds crazy, but I...

35:11.640 --> 35:15.480
I set all of this up
to try and save my wife.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.120
He's telling the truth.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.840
I had Lancasters.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.440
This whole place
served as the clinic.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.320
In order to pay for the cost
of her treatment, I...

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
I operated on people down here.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.400
- What people?
- Well, criminals. Mainly criminals.

35:39.880 --> 35:43.720
But ordinary people as well.
People suffering from Lancasters.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.120
So, who helped you?

35:48.120 --> 35:49.520
What do you mean?

35:49.640 --> 35:55.840
What I mean is, why don't you talk to me
about Lee Simmons and Jamie Harris.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.720
Lee Simmons
was a patient of mine.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.360
He seemed to know a lot
about underground London.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.640
He told me about spaces like this.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.480
That's as far as my contact
ever went with him.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.760
I don't know what he's doing now.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.960
Jamie Harris was my first
unofficial patient.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.960
He'd been shot.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.080
Should we take him up
to the van now, ma'am?

36:26.920 --> 36:29.320
Yeah, take him.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.160
Get him out of my sight.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.200
Move it.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.440
How far does this tunnel extend
each direction?

37:05.680 --> 37:07.160
Pretty far.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.760
I'll maybe take a recce that way
for any surprises.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.240
That's quite a show
you put on.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.120
You think you can just
go around shooting police?

37:22.480 --> 37:23.880
He was my friend.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.560
And you killed him.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.280
- I didn't kill him.
- Bullshit!

37:32.800 --> 37:34.320
I'm telling the truth.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.080
I wouldn't want to be you.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.840
You are gonna have a really hard time
where you...

37:42.960 --> 37:44.720
He's got a gun!

37:45.760 --> 37:48.320
- Come on!
- Shots fired! Shots fired!

38:12.000 --> 38:14.760
- What the fuck happened?
- He was going for a gun.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.320
I had to take him down,
I had no choice.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.880
Get in there and find his body.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.920
It's okay.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.440
Finally!

39:12.080 --> 39:14.400
We did it, Lee.
We did it!

39:14.760 --> 39:16.920
- We were all over the news!
- Ash...

39:23.680 --> 39:25.600
Daniel's dead.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.320
Who?

39:32.120 --> 39:34.280
Lee.
Jesus, what happened?

39:37.280 --> 39:38.800
They've killed him!

39:41.240 --> 39:43.720
- Wait, what? Who?
- Daniel.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.160
Can you get a message
to my daughter?

40:59.280 --> 41:01.160
Absolutely not!

41:34.680 --> 41:36.200
You don't exist.

41:38.400 --> 41:43.000
You don't complain. No games.
No complications.

41:45.400 --> 41:50.000
From here on in,
all you do is work for me.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.640
I thought this was a partnership.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.440
Well, that's a nice thought.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.400
Try and look at it
in the positive, Daniel.

42:04.640 --> 42:09.920
Your life just went from very complicated
to nice and simple.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.400
Oh, cheer up, then, shall I?

42:20.480 --> 42:22.160
Come along, Officer.
