WEBVTT

00:02.401 --> 00:04.402
What's the first thing
we need to do? Al?

00:04.403 --> 00:05.804
Find a stud, tim.

00:05.805 --> 00:08.306
And I think we've come to
the right place, haven't we?

00:08.307 --> 00:11.476
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Al, do you recognize this?

00:11.477 --> 00:13.778
Your razor, tim?

00:13.779 --> 00:16.648
No. Actually,
it's your razor, al.
I picked it up backstage.

00:16.649 --> 00:19.517
Electric razor can double
as a stud finder.

00:19.518 --> 00:20.551
<i>(razor runs)</i>

00:25.124 --> 00:26.925
No stud there.

00:26.926 --> 00:30.128
Actually, al's electric razor
can be a stud finder.

00:30.129 --> 00:33.131
If you listen,
the sound of it changes
the closer you get to a stud.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.301
<i>(finds stud)</i>

00:39.872 --> 00:43.274
My mother gave me
that razor, tim.

00:43.275 --> 00:46.678
Why? Did she
go back to blades?

00:46.679 --> 00:50.015
This razor can not only keep
al's mother whisker-free,

00:50.016 --> 00:52.751
It's a handy way to find
studs around the house.

00:52.752 --> 00:55.319
Well, tim, I also have
a helpful household hint.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.488
I'm going to show
the audience

00:57.489 --> 00:59.590
Something you don't
ordinarily do with a potato.

00:59.591 --> 01:01.893
You might wanna keep the kids
away from the tv set.
Tim.

01:04.163 --> 01:07.565
Here's a safe way to take
a broken bulb from its socket.

01:07.566 --> 01:11.402
You simply
take a cut potato, jam it
into the socket, twist...

01:11.403 --> 01:14.139
And in minutes, you have
thousands of curly fries...

01:14.140 --> 01:16.374
Tim, tim, tim...

01:16.375 --> 01:19.377
I doubted the razor,
but I gave it a chance.

01:19.378 --> 01:21.212
Please do not mock
my potato.

01:22.848 --> 01:26.751
You say potato,
I say stupid. Ha-ha-ha.

01:26.752 --> 01:28.119
Tim, this'll work.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.755
You twist
and pull the broken bulb
right out of the socket.

01:30.756 --> 01:32.290
But first, you must...

01:32.291 --> 01:33.591
Jam it in the light.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.567
Unplug the lamp.

02:51.670 --> 02:55.406
What do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

02:58.878 --> 03:02.580
Congratulations. You're
now the ping-pong champion
in the taylor house.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.182
You let me win.

03:04.183 --> 03:07.118
I didn't let you win. You got
that delicate, high, slow lob.

03:07.119 --> 03:10.255
I lose concentration
before it hits the table.
That's brilliant.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.956
Where are all the mugs?

03:11.957 --> 03:14.192
In the sink
with the dirty dishes.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.895
Aw, shucks. I wanted
a cup of coffee.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.363
Why don't you just wash one?

03:19.364 --> 03:22.133
Mark, a man never
loads a dishwasher

03:22.134 --> 03:24.803
Till the sink
is completely filled.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.805
And besides, I just
want some coffee,

03:26.806 --> 03:29.140
And all I need there
is something with a handle,

03:29.141 --> 03:31.475
And I think
the moo-cow creamer
is gonna work.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.180
Mmm.

03:36.748 --> 03:39.083
That's good. That's good.

03:39.084 --> 03:41.519
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, honey.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.789
Great news. Mr. Preston,
the features editor,

03:44.790 --> 03:47.692
Loved the research that I did
on the weekend getaway story.

03:47.693 --> 03:49.828
That's great.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.030
He's gonna let me research
next month's cover story.

03:52.031 --> 03:55.233
I get to work
for a whole 'nother week.
I am so excited.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.236
That's great. The cover?
You been working a month,
you're doing the cover?

03:58.237 --> 03:59.871
Yes.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.040
What are you gonna do,
tiger stadium moving?
The new riverfront project?

04:02.041 --> 04:03.574
Compost.

04:05.211 --> 04:08.412
You're not bringing
your work home, are ya?

04:08.413 --> 04:12.116
No. It's industrial compost.
Hi, sweetie.

04:12.117 --> 04:14.819
Could be the answer
to the big garbage problem.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.521
Did you not notice
the dirty dishes
in the sink?

04:17.522 --> 04:18.890
I didn't notice
those there.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.491
But, dad, you said...

04:20.492 --> 04:21.524
Eat a grape.

04:21.526 --> 04:24.628
I'm going downstairs.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.630
What are you doing?

04:29.168 --> 04:31.502
Moo!

04:34.139 --> 04:36.040
Enjoying a cup of coffee.

04:36.041 --> 04:40.411
You are sucking coffee
out of a cow.

04:40.412 --> 04:43.214
That way, I don't
have to add milk.

04:43.215 --> 04:46.217
Hmm. You are so pathetic.

04:46.218 --> 04:50.021
Listen, I got to get
this compost research story
done by Friday,

04:50.022 --> 04:52.056
So I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

04:52.057 --> 04:53.858
You need to run
this house.

04:53.859 --> 04:56.460
Moo!

04:58.130 --> 05:00.064
Not a problem.

05:00.065 --> 05:02.300
I would feel a lot better
if you would say,

05:02.301 --> 05:04.335
"I'll do the best I can."

05:04.336 --> 05:08.139
You want to say
I'll do the best I can?
Not a problem.

05:08.140 --> 05:11.976
This is
a list of all the things
you have to do tomorrow.

05:11.977 --> 05:14.578
See, this is
the dry-cleaning slip.
You gotta pick that up.

05:14.579 --> 05:17.548
Then go to the grocery store.
Here's the list for that.

05:17.549 --> 05:19.918
Oh, you gotta make
the boys' lunches.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.921
Can you put in
some celery sticks
or carrot sticks?

05:22.922 --> 05:25.423
Jill, they don't
eat that stuff.

05:25.424 --> 05:28.526
They just turn into
vegetable missiles
in a food fight.

05:28.527 --> 05:31.662
Honey, I'll be able to relax
and work a lot better

05:31.663 --> 05:35.533
If I know that you're back here
doing everything the right way.

05:35.534 --> 05:37.101
You mean your way?

05:37.102 --> 05:39.637
That's what I said,
the right way.

05:39.638 --> 05:42.506
Mom, we need our pants
for football practice.

05:42.507 --> 05:45.310
Oh, no, I meant
to wash those this morning.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.412
It's ok. I'll take care of it.
I'm running things now.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.780
Guys, let's go
wash those pants.

05:49.781 --> 05:51.782
Tim, you know, this is really
a complicated deal here.

05:51.783 --> 05:54.953
There's two loads.
There's a dark load.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.156
That needs cold water
and this darker-blue bleach.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.791
And the white load needs
hot water and the white bleach.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.061
And you can't forget to add
the fabric softener.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.395
What time is practice?

06:04.396 --> 06:05.529
15 minutes.

06:09.668 --> 06:11.235
That load's done.

06:11.236 --> 06:12.303
Thanks, dad.

06:12.304 --> 06:14.038
Thanks, dad.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.178
Tim, where are
the boys' lunches?

06:20.179 --> 06:21.980
I only have two hands, ok?

06:21.981 --> 06:24.248
I'll load the dishwasher,
then I'll make their lunches.

06:24.249 --> 06:27.318
No, no. Honey,
you have to make the lunches
and then load the dishwasher.

06:27.319 --> 06:29.354
What is the difference?
<i>(bus horn honks)</i>

06:29.355 --> 06:31.356
There's the bus.
That's the difference.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.690
Oh, no.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.525
Now they don't have
any lunch.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.861
Hold on, guys.
I got this covered.

06:36.862 --> 06:38.629
I'm buying lunch today.
Here's two bucks.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.198
Buy something nutritious.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.565
Yeah, right.

06:41.566 --> 06:43.401
Yeah, go get some carrots

06:43.402 --> 06:45.236
Out of that vending machine
they have.

06:45.237 --> 06:49.107
Dad, can I have $2 for mark?
He's outside waiting for us.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.909
Make sure he gets it.
He will.

06:53.312 --> 06:57.181
At least mark
won't spend the money
on junk food.

06:57.182 --> 07:00.084
Dad, can I have
a peanut butter sandwich
in my lunch today?

07:00.085 --> 07:02.120
What are you doing here?
I gave your brothers
your lunch money.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.355
At least they didn't
beat him up for it.

07:04.356 --> 07:06.257
You're gonna miss the bus.

07:06.258 --> 07:08.359
It's ok.
Don't worry about it.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.063
I will
just give you a ride to school
on my way to the compost heap.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.465
Try not to
confuse those two, hon.

07:14.466 --> 07:16.901
Are we gonna make
the gingerbread house tonight?

07:16.902 --> 07:20.438
Oh, right,
the pta bake sale.

07:20.439 --> 07:25.343
Um, honey, I think
we may have to buy that
at the bakery this year.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.479
But you said you were gonna
make one with me.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.450
I know I did.
I'm really sorry.
I'm so busy this week.

07:32.451 --> 07:35.019
Hey, I'll make you
a gingerbread house.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.820
Really?

07:36.821 --> 07:38.889
Yeah, and not some
dinky little house.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.558
We'll get a gingerbread

07:40.559 --> 07:42.560
Full-service
truck and auto service center.

07:42.561 --> 07:43.961
Wow.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.829
Darn right wow. Oh!

07:45.830 --> 07:48.232
Go get your coat.

07:48.233 --> 07:52.036
Tim, honey, don't use
the blue sponge on the counter.

07:52.037 --> 07:53.071
Huh?

07:53.072 --> 07:54.939
The blue sponge
is for the dishes.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.308
The green sponge
is for the counter.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.210
What's the difference?

07:59.211 --> 08:01.979
You're not supposed to use
the same sponge on the counter
as the dishes.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.148
So the blue sponge
is just for the sink?

08:04.149 --> 08:05.216
No, not always.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.685
When the blue sponge
gets dirty,

08:07.686 --> 08:09.753
It gets demoted
from the dishes
to the counter.

08:09.754 --> 08:12.590
The green sponge gets demoted
from the counter to the floor.

08:12.591 --> 08:16.461
Then I pull a new out
from here. It might be blue,
it might be yellow.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.296
Oh! Oh! Oh!

08:20.466 --> 08:23.134
Tim, are you gonna
be able to handle...

08:23.135 --> 08:25.336
I'll be able to handle it.
...'cause if you can't,
I could just...

08:25.337 --> 08:28.005
Let me do this my way, ok?

08:28.006 --> 08:30.007
You know, jill... I think
it's just about time

08:30.008 --> 08:32.610
You saw how effective
my way can be.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.611
Mark, shall we show her
what's in the garage?

08:34.613 --> 08:36.313
Why?

08:36.315 --> 08:37.582
Dad fixed the washer.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.116
Aw, no!

08:42.386 --> 08:46.524
What did you do
to my washing machine?!

08:46.525 --> 08:48.759
Why is it
on life support?

08:51.430 --> 08:52.863
I improved it.

08:52.864 --> 08:54.865
Unimprove it.
Come on, honey.

08:54.866 --> 08:56.033
It has lights.

08:56.034 --> 08:57.868
Just for effect, ok?

08:57.869 --> 09:02.006
I have revolutionized
the laundry-care system.

09:02.007 --> 09:03.841
Now stay with me
on this, ok?

09:03.842 --> 09:06.444
You're watching tv.
You're watching a little
football game...

09:06.445 --> 09:08.446
I don't like football.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.081
All right, you're watching
the op... Era,

09:11.082 --> 09:13.984
And it's third and goal,
and you hear the buzzer,
baap!

09:13.985 --> 09:17.221
Time to add
the fabric softener, you go,
"oh, you don't wanna leave."

09:17.222 --> 09:20.424
You'll miss that fat broad with
the horns doing the high notes,
spiking the ball, all right?

09:20.425 --> 09:21.925
You see what I've got here?

09:21.926 --> 09:24.362
Bleach, detergent,
fabric softener
on timers and tubes.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.664
This adds it by itself
on a timed cycle.

09:26.665 --> 09:28.699
It's about ready to go
right about...

09:28.700 --> 09:30.968
<i>(timer goes off)</i>

09:40.312 --> 09:44.549
I can't believe it. It worked.
It actually worked.

09:44.550 --> 09:50.221
As you see, honey,
I've got things under control,
so have a nice day.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.723
It actually worked.
Have a nice day, hon.

09:52.724 --> 09:57.161
And don't sound so shocked.
Mark, mark. <i>(whistles)</i>

09:57.162 --> 09:59.397
This morning,
I improved the washer.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.633
This afternoon,
I improve the dryer.

10:02.634 --> 10:03.834
How?

10:03.835 --> 10:06.537
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

10:06.538 --> 10:11.609
See this? Binford's 20-amp,
high-density electric motor.

10:11.610 --> 10:15.646
Once I attach that to the dryer,
that'll spin so fast...

10:15.647 --> 10:18.816
You know those cowboys
on your pjs?

10:18.817 --> 10:21.118
They'll be throwing up
in their saddlebags.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.054
Wow.

10:24.055 --> 10:26.290
Arr-arr-arr-arr!

10:30.862 --> 10:33.764
I just think we have done
sheet rock to death.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.666
"sheet rock to death."

10:35.667 --> 10:39.403
Doesn't sound like you talking.
That sounds like
maureen binford.

10:39.404 --> 10:41.872
Well, she is the producer.

10:41.873 --> 10:44.442
And I don't think she wants
to do a show on sheet rock.

10:44.443 --> 10:48.178
I don't give a sheet rock
what she wants to do.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.748
People, people,
let's gather.

10:50.749 --> 10:52.883
Maureen, there's only
two of us out here.

10:52.884 --> 10:54.285
I think we're gathered.

10:54.286 --> 10:57.855
Good. Ok. Let's confab
about tomorrow's show.

10:57.856 --> 11:00.424
All set. Tomorrow, we're gonna
do sheet rock installation.

11:00.425 --> 11:03.327
Oh, tim, we've done
sheet rock to death.

11:03.328 --> 11:04.662
I was just telling tim....

11:04.663 --> 11:06.664
Shut up, al.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.500
You want to electrocute me
in a lamp again with a potato?

11:09.501 --> 11:11.435
No, silly.
We already did that.

11:11.436 --> 11:14.972
But I do think we should
devote the show to more
clever household hints.

11:14.973 --> 11:20.043
I'm thinking...
The bachelor corner with al.

11:20.044 --> 11:21.545
Al?

11:21.546 --> 11:26.016
Yeah, you know, how to get
spots out with club soda.

11:26.017 --> 11:29.453
Or using vinegar and water
to clean windows.

11:29.454 --> 11:31.989
That's a good one.
Or how to iron
with wax paper.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.258
Maureen,
this is a man's show.

11:34.259 --> 11:36.294
We give man advice.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.928
How to pull a nail
out of your foot.

11:37.929 --> 11:42.667
What... What to do
with a severed finger.

11:42.668 --> 11:45.536
Men don't wanna know
about ironing.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.471
Well, tim, a lot of men
are single.

11:47.472 --> 11:50.974
Yes, they are. And
wax paper between the folds
when you're ironing

11:50.975 --> 11:55.078
Really does give you
a nice pleat.

11:55.079 --> 11:57.047
Thank you, al.

11:57.048 --> 12:00.050
I'll remember that next time
we do cross-dressing day.

12:00.051 --> 12:05.055
Ok, well, I get
the feeling we're simpatico.
Yes, no, maybe?

12:05.056 --> 12:07.325
We'll do the sheet rock
installation.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.428
No, we won't, tim.
Need I remind you...

12:10.429 --> 12:13.731
Producer! <i>(laughs)</i>

12:13.732 --> 12:16.334
<i>(mocking her)</i> annoying!

12:16.335 --> 12:17.968
He is such a card.

12:17.969 --> 12:20.771
Yes, he is,
and he needs to be
dealt with.

12:26.044 --> 12:28.379
Are you two through?

12:28.380 --> 12:30.581
Oh, I almost forgot.
Jill called.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.717
She needs you
to pick up randy.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.586
She said something about
being up to her ears
in compost.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.521
Toodles.
Oh, I never see that.

12:40.425 --> 12:44.094
I gotta pick up randy. Jill
was supposed to pick up randy.

12:44.095 --> 12:47.998
I'm doing a lot more than
my share around the house
these days.

12:47.999 --> 12:52.770
Well, tim, marriage
is all about compromise,

12:52.771 --> 12:54.104
Give and take,

12:54.105 --> 12:56.774
Understanding each other
and sharing.

12:56.775 --> 12:59.309
That was beautiful, al.

12:59.310 --> 13:02.480
Wanna hold hands
and sing "feelings"?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.117
I was just trying to help.

13:07.118 --> 13:09.152
I don't need help
on my marriage

13:09.153 --> 13:11.154
From a guy
who hasn't been married.

13:11.155 --> 13:13.056
You think I don't know

13:13.057 --> 13:15.158
What it feels like
to be married to you?

13:15.159 --> 13:16.460
Huh?

13:16.461 --> 13:18.763
Sharing a workbench
for three long years

13:18.764 --> 13:22.933
And never having you
once put the cap
back on the epoxy.

13:22.934 --> 13:25.369
And don't think that
I haven't noticed

13:25.370 --> 13:29.072
That you squeeze
the tube from the middle
instead of the end.

13:29.073 --> 13:32.075
These are some of things

13:32.076 --> 13:34.845
I have to take home
with me every night.

13:34.846 --> 13:36.914
I don't think
we should call your segment
"bachelor corner."

13:36.915 --> 13:40.317
We should call it "the alone
and desperate corner."

13:43.054 --> 13:44.922
I really appreciate this,
wilson.

13:44.923 --> 13:47.224
My pleasure,
good neighbor.

13:47.225 --> 13:52.362
Always happy to help out
with a molasses emergency.

13:52.363 --> 13:55.566
Jill's working extra hours,
so I didn't have a chance
to get to the store.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.735
Mm, so you're running
the house tonight?

13:57.736 --> 14:00.304
I'm trying to, but she's not
making it any easier.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.773
Mm-hmm, mm-mm-mm.

14:02.774 --> 14:04.442
She just can't stand

14:04.443 --> 14:06.844
To let me do things
the way I want to do them,

14:06.845 --> 14:09.413
Because she just won't
deal with the fact

14:09.414 --> 14:12.316
That my ways may be different,
but they get the job done.

14:12.317 --> 14:16.286
Well, tim, sometimes
it's hard for people
to accept new ideas.

14:16.287 --> 14:18.489
Not me. Thank you.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.290
Well, you're
a very special man,

14:20.291 --> 14:21.992
Quite like galileo.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.261
Yeah. Had his wine.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.832
No, no, no. Tim...

14:27.833 --> 14:31.134
I'm talking about
the 17th-century
italian astronomer.

14:31.135 --> 14:32.636
He was ridiculed

14:32.637 --> 14:35.806
For teaching that the earth
revolves around the sun.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.375
And he believed that?

14:38.376 --> 14:41.645
Tim, the earth does
revolve around the sun.

14:41.646 --> 14:45.282
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure,
yeah, it does.

14:45.283 --> 14:47.351
It's just we're spinning,
so we don't notice it.

14:47.352 --> 14:49.720
There you go, good neighbor.
What happened to him?

14:49.721 --> 14:53.323
Well, he was threatened
with torture and forced to
confess that he was wrong.

14:53.324 --> 14:55.493
That's what jill
would like to do to me,

14:55.494 --> 14:57.327
But I'm not confessing anything,

14:57.328 --> 14:59.162
'cause I'm not doing
anything wrong.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.164
Tim, that's not
the point of the story.

15:01.165 --> 15:04.301
I don't care. I'm gonna
keep doing things my way because
we're getting things done.

15:04.302 --> 15:05.402
Thanks a lot, wilson.

15:05.403 --> 15:08.939
Tim? Tim? Can we
talk about compromise?

15:10.942 --> 15:12.175
Thanks.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.177
What is the paint pan for?

15:14.178 --> 15:16.647
I wanna make sure
the walls of the truck
and auto service center

15:16.648 --> 15:20.350
Are big enough
to handle the big rigs.

15:20.351 --> 15:22.686
Mom never uses
paint pans.

15:22.687 --> 15:24.755
Do I look like mom?

15:24.756 --> 15:26.524
On occasion.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.395
Is the paint pan clean?

15:31.396 --> 15:33.964
Of course. I scrubbed it out
with turpentine.

15:35.266 --> 15:38.135
Dad, that's never gonna
fit in the oven.

15:38.136 --> 15:41.238
It'll fit right in the oven.
I already...

15:41.239 --> 15:45.075
Just tip it a little bit,
goes right in there.

15:45.076 --> 15:47.845
Mom's gonna freak when she sees
the mess you're making.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.915
Don't worry about it.
This is a self-cleaning oven.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.517
Dad, these walls
won't stay up.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.653
Would you guys
work with me on this?

15:55.654 --> 15:58.689
That's why I got
the caulking compound
over here.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.825
You can't use caulk.
You have to be able
to eat it.

16:01.826 --> 16:03.861
We don't have to worry
about that.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.597
We're just selling it.
Somebody else is eating it.

16:06.598 --> 16:10.467
Wait, wait. Maybe caulk
would be a last resort.

16:10.468 --> 16:13.604
Let's try to make
the icing work.

16:13.605 --> 16:18.275
Go out to the garage, get me
some "c" clamps and duct tape.

16:18.276 --> 16:20.644
You wrecked it,
you wrecked it!

16:20.645 --> 16:22.646
Way to go. Fiddling around
with the thing now!

16:22.647 --> 16:23.747
It was an accident.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.148
You did it on purpose.

16:25.149 --> 16:26.817
Get off me,
you little flea!

16:26.818 --> 16:27.952
Come on, let him up.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.954
Dad, I can't find
the "c" clamps.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.622
Whoa, something's burning.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.090
No!

16:35.259 --> 16:36.994
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.796
You ok?

16:38.797 --> 16:40.297
Yeah. "c" clamps...

16:40.298 --> 16:41.331
Help!

16:41.332 --> 16:43.500
What's going on here?

16:43.501 --> 16:46.136
Hey, hey, hey!
Get off of him right now!

16:46.137 --> 16:49.539
He started it.
He wrecked
my gingerbread house!

16:49.540 --> 16:51.976
Boys, just go upstairs. Now!

16:51.977 --> 16:53.844
Boy, you're home early.

16:56.414 --> 16:58.548
What is happening here?

16:58.549 --> 17:01.551
I spilled a little batter.
The oven was too hot, I think,
when I put it in there.

17:01.552 --> 17:02.920
You used a paint pan?

17:02.921 --> 17:05.387
Yeah, trying to make those walls
big enough for the big rig...

17:05.388 --> 17:09.559
Don't explain. We'll just
scrape it out. Maybe we can
save some of the batter.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.560
Good. That's it...
Where's my old spatula?

17:11.561 --> 17:12.963
It's right over here.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.464
It doesn't go over here.
It goes over here.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.500
Not when I'm doing the cooking.
That's where it goes.

17:16.501 --> 17:19.169
When you're home
doing the cooking, you put it
where you want it.

17:19.170 --> 17:23.140
When I'm home? Is that
what all this is about?

17:23.141 --> 17:24.942
What?

17:24.943 --> 17:28.411
So finally it comes out.
You don't want me to work.

17:28.412 --> 17:30.114
Because I moved a spatula?

17:30.115 --> 17:33.316
You resent the fact
that I am working.

17:33.317 --> 17:35.252
I do not!

17:35.253 --> 17:37.821
Then why don't you do one thing
the way I ask you to do it?

17:37.822 --> 17:40.190
One? I've done everything

17:40.191 --> 17:42.192
On your stupid little list
over here.

17:42.193 --> 17:44.995
You screwed up everything
on my stupid little list
over there!

17:44.996 --> 17:46.596
I haven't screwed up
everything.

17:46.597 --> 17:48.532
Name one thing
you didn't screw up.
Um...

17:51.870 --> 17:53.303
Well?

17:53.304 --> 17:55.039
Laundry?

17:55.040 --> 17:58.075
Dad, the dryer's
going crazy!

17:58.076 --> 18:01.078
Hold on. I'll handle this.
You just...

18:01.079 --> 18:03.380
Wow, this is great.

18:03.381 --> 18:05.115
Come on, get off
of there, randy.

18:05.116 --> 18:06.884
Get him off.
Unplug it over there.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.886
Aah! You do it.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.554
Honey, it's just 220.

18:10.555 --> 18:12.723
Be careful. Aah!

18:12.724 --> 18:14.892
Here, just stop
the thing. Stop it.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.626
All right, I got it.

18:16.627 --> 18:18.996
Look, I got
this rubber glove.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.231
All right, I got...
Honey, honey.

18:21.232 --> 18:24.001
All right. Aah!
I got it!

18:25.070 --> 18:26.636
Hey!

18:26.637 --> 18:29.173
Wow. Cool.

18:29.174 --> 18:33.143
I have friends
who'd pay good money
to ride this.

18:33.144 --> 18:35.012
Out.

18:35.013 --> 18:38.215
Oh, man, everybody
gets to make money
except for me.

18:38.216 --> 18:42.552
Look at there.
Everything's all dry.

18:42.553 --> 18:45.288
Maybe this is just a sign

18:45.289 --> 18:48.325
That I'm not
supposed to be working.

18:48.326 --> 18:50.560
What do you mean by that?

18:50.561 --> 18:54.397
We're fighting about spatulas,
you're riding the dryer.

18:54.398 --> 18:56.433
I don't know that it's worth it.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.602
But you wanna work.

18:58.603 --> 19:01.071
I wanna work, tim,
but I also don't want
the house to fall apart.

19:01.072 --> 19:03.640
I see. It's always like that.

19:03.641 --> 19:07.945
I ride one appliance
in the garage...

19:07.946 --> 19:09.980
And you get all
bent out of shape.

19:12.083 --> 19:16.186
The house isn't gonna
fall apart if you're not here,
and I'm here!

19:16.187 --> 19:18.655
And don't take this wrong,
but you don't have to work.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.224
I want to work.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.425
We got three kids
we gotta get through college.

19:22.426 --> 19:24.294
Or a good trade school.

19:24.295 --> 19:28.198
I like working. You know,
and I'm good at it.

19:28.199 --> 19:31.101
I think that I could move up.
I might even be an editor.

19:31.102 --> 19:33.837
But the whole time I'm working,
I worry about what's going on
at the house,

19:33.838 --> 19:36.506
And when I'm at the house,
I worry about work. I just
wish there were two of me.

19:36.507 --> 19:38.441
Could I sleep in the middle?

19:39.510 --> 19:42.345
Morning, jill.
Hello there, jill.

19:42.346 --> 19:43.280
Hey.

19:45.716 --> 19:50.453
Fine. If you don't wanna
talk about it, I'm gonna
figure it out by myself.

19:50.454 --> 19:53.056
And that, my dear,
is the problem.

19:53.057 --> 19:55.125
You wanna do everything
by yourself.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.961
There are two people.
The other person here is me.

19:57.962 --> 20:01.364
You got to learn how
to let me do some of the stuff
the way I wanna do it.

20:01.365 --> 20:03.667
Like giving the boys
lunch money?

20:03.668 --> 20:05.368
Burning down the kitchen,

20:05.369 --> 20:07.070
Riding the thing
around the garage?

20:07.071 --> 20:08.906
Hold on, back the truck up.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.041
Some of the things
went well today, you know.

20:11.042 --> 20:13.043
Tim, look around you.

20:13.044 --> 20:14.912
You practically
wrecked the house.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.246
I'll have you know

20:16.247 --> 20:18.816
I wrecked this house
long before you ever got a job.

20:18.817 --> 20:22.219
And I'll be wrecking this house
long after you got a job.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.455
The kids were dressed,
they had their breakfast,
they got to school,

20:25.456 --> 20:28.458
They had their lunch,
and they came home,
and they were safe.

20:28.459 --> 20:31.528
So maybe my way
wasn't that dangerous
after all,

20:31.529 --> 20:34.431
And some of the things
did work, didn't they?

20:34.432 --> 20:35.966
Well, that
washing machine...

20:35.967 --> 20:37.500
What about
the washing machine?

20:37.501 --> 20:38.936
That was pretty cool.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.671
<i>(grunts)</i> you like that?
Oh-oh-oh.

20:41.672 --> 20:42.772
Yeah.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.241
<i>(makes monkey noises)</i>

20:47.712 --> 20:49.779
So if this is gonna work,

20:49.780 --> 20:53.817
Then I'm gonna have to
let go of some things

20:53.818 --> 20:57.520
And make sure that
the smoke detector is working.

20:58.589 --> 21:00.790
You got to put a battery
in that thing.

21:00.791 --> 21:02.525
I think so.

21:02.526 --> 21:05.095
And if you're
gonna come home early,

21:05.096 --> 21:07.130
Gimme a phone call first.

21:07.131 --> 21:08.966
Yeah, right.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.968
All right, well, as long as
we're both here together,

21:10.969 --> 21:12.970
Why don't you
help me clean up?

21:12.971 --> 21:15.005
Honey, I think
this is the first time

21:15.006 --> 21:18.141
That I'm going
to let go of something.

21:21.846 --> 21:24.814
Whoa! That icing
is really bad.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.017
That's 'cause it's not icing.

21:27.018 --> 21:28.352
Huh?

21:28.353 --> 21:31.755
It's polyvinyl acetate
caulking compound.

21:33.057 --> 21:36.793
You've just weather-proofed
your tongue, honey.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.334
I'll sue!

21:45.770 --> 21:49.072
<i>(makes engine sounds)</i>

21:49.073 --> 21:51.909
Don't run, run, run. We got
a piece of artwork here.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.343
It's crooked.

21:53.344 --> 21:54.878
I designed it this way.

21:54.879 --> 21:57.580
This is a gingerbread
truck and auto service center

21:57.581 --> 22:00.817
After a major earthquake.

22:00.818 --> 22:03.787
Do you actually think
anybody's gonna buy this?

22:03.788 --> 22:06.189
Yes, I actually
think somebody's
going to buy this.

22:06.190 --> 22:09.226
Tim, you can't charge $156.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.795
Why? That's what it cost.

22:11.796 --> 22:15.232
Boys, put on your coats
and mittens and stuff.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.833
Mark, are you ready?!

22:16.834 --> 22:19.303
Has anybody seen
my good blue sweater?

22:19.304 --> 22:22.005
Uh, I did. It's in the...

22:22.006 --> 22:23.307
What?

22:23.308 --> 22:24.374
I don't know.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.475
Brad?

22:25.476 --> 22:27.110
Gee, I don't know.

22:27.111 --> 22:28.345
I'm ready.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.280
Mark, have you seen
my good blue sweater?

22:30.281 --> 22:31.381
It's in the dryer.

22:31.382 --> 22:33.750
Thanks, big mouth.

22:33.751 --> 22:36.019
Oh...

22:36.020 --> 22:38.088
H-h-honey, you ok?

22:42.026 --> 22:44.428
What is this?

22:49.167 --> 22:52.702
Boys, put on your coats
and mittens and stuff.

22:52.703 --> 22:55.638
Randy... What is your name?

22:57.641 --> 23:00.277
Yeah, it's randy, mom.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.347
Well, you are
a very special man,

23:03.348 --> 23:05.315
Quite like galileo.

23:05.316 --> 23:08.018
Yeah, I love his wine.

23:09.487 --> 23:11.088
No, no, no, tim. No, no, no.

23:11.089 --> 23:14.257
I'm talking about
the 17th-century
italian astronomer.

23:14.258 --> 23:18.362
He was... A very fat man.
