<i># Your heart
is always almost beating</i>

00:54.040 --> 01:01.754
<i># Along with windy frozen tunes</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:05.670
<i># But you say you've laughed enough</i>

01:05.800 --> 01:12.273
<i># Your closet's stuffed
with last year's blues</i>

01:14.160 --> 01:17.994
<i># But you know by summertime</i>

01:18.120 --> 01:25.674
<i># Your suicide's just last year's news</i>

01:33.120 --> 01:35.395
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.317
- Good to go?
- Hm-hmm.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.795
Mandy Lane.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.640
- Hi.
- Someone got fucking hot this summer!

01:56.760 --> 01:59.752
- Thank you.
- Shut up, faggot.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.075
Hey, Mandy.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.472
- Hey, why don't you come with us?
- Jake, there's no room.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.160
There's plenty of room.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.400
<i>- Where are you guys going?
- My place.</i>

02:13.520 --> 02:15.636
Little pool party.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.829
Sure, we'll go.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.439
Who's "we"?

02:20.560 --> 02:24.030
- Yeah, who's "we"?
- You and me.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.039
Sweet.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.758
<i># What will we find
inside of your room?</i>

02:33.880 --> 02:36.952
<i># Notes in the margins</i>

02:37.080 --> 02:40.516
<i># Records always spinning</i>

02:40.640 --> 02:46.192
<i># Clues you know you want all to know</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:50.632
<i># Your little soul grew old too soon</i>

02:53.920 --> 02:57.674
<i># And surprises lost their thrill</i>

02:57.800 --> 02:59.279
<i># The cut and pills and...</i>

02:59.400 --> 03:01.709
<i>Open up, man!</i>

03:27.080 --> 03:30.789
What, no bathing suit? That sucks.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.717
No big deal.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.152
Just go in your underwear.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.152
You have no idea how hot you are,
do you?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.950
No. This is cute.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.878
- I like this. What is this?
- Stop!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.956
Come on, don't be shy about it.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.274
Strip right here.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.748
Let everyone see what colour
those panties are.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.078
What the fuck?

04:04.320 --> 04:06.231
Fucking dick!

04:08.280 --> 04:09.679
Dude!

04:09.800 --> 04:11.552
Laugh now, you fucking dick!

04:12.560 --> 04:13.788
Dylan, stop.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.952
Mandy, I was just playing around
with this kid.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.475
Mandy, no... He saved my life, man.
This guy, he's amazing.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.353
He's a winner.
You're fucking amazing, you know that?

04:29.480 --> 04:32.278
<i>- So you're OK?
- I'm fine.</i>

04:32.400 --> 04:33.515
Fine.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.558
<i>Hey.</i>

04:45.680 --> 04:47.238
Easy, easy.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.510
I come in peace.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.358
What, she won't talk to you now?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.591
- That figures.
- Look...

05:00.080 --> 05:03.868
Let's just play nice and be friends
and get the fuck off my roof.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.793
OK?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.551
So how are you gonna do it?

05:28.160 --> 05:29.559
Do what?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.752
Seal the deal.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.752
I mean, look. Look down there.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.193
Every stupid fucking idiot
has the exact same goal.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.231
What makes you any different?

05:41.360 --> 05:43.555
I don't need to be different.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.556
Jesus, are you fucking listening to me?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.159
I know her.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.398
She's not gonna fall for some jock
who tried to drown her best friend.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.909
Face it, man, you're boring.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.112
You're a fucking marshmallow,
like an American Idol...

05:59.240 --> 06:02.038
Get off my fucking roof, Emmet.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.628
- This went well.
- What are you doing?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.318
Whoa, whoa!

06:13.320 --> 06:14.673
- Careful, man.
- Look.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.476
She's looking at us right now.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.194
Waiting to see what you do.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.188
Well?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.432
It's not that far.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.552
You've fucking done this before, right?

06:35.240 --> 06:36.434
She'll love it.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.028
She... I promise.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.233
Whoa! You know what?
Fuck it, you're too drunk.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.078
Don't!

06:50.200 --> 06:54.113
Don't tell me I'm too fucking drunk
in my own fucking house.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.039
I'll do it with you, then.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.915
Come on!

07:02.560 --> 07:04.630
Let's jump for Mandy.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.716
See if she can catch us.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.910
<i>Dylan, get down from there.</i>

07:09.040 --> 07:11.031
You, too, you fucking loser.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.114
Ready?

07:15.960 --> 07:16.949
One.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.119
Two.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.919
Three.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.871
<i>- Mandy Lane!
- # Today</i>

07:31.000 --> 07:34.470
<i># It's gonna be</i>

07:34.600 --> 07:37.273
<i># Such a good day</i>

07:37.400 --> 07:39.436
<i># Such a good day</i>

07:40.880 --> 07:44.509
<i># Today is gonna be</i>

07:44.640 --> 07:48.076
<i>Somebody get help!</i>

07:48.200 --> 07:50.873
<i># Such a good day</i>

07:52.000 --> 07:55.515
<i># To say goodbye</i>

07:57.720 --> 08:05.149
<i># Today is gonna be such a good day</i>

08:05.280 --> 08:06.679
<i>Oh, no!</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:12.878
Hey, you stupid fuck!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.355
Look what you made him do!

08:17.160 --> 08:19.116
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

08:24.440 --> 08:25.395
<i># Eagles, Eagles, we're the best!</i>

08:26.040 --> 08:27.792
<i>Better than all the rest!</i>

08:27.920 --> 08:31.549
<i># Eagles, Eagles, we're number one!
So let's go have some fun!</i>

08:31.680 --> 08:35.070
<i># Eagles, Eagles, we're the best!
Better than all the rest!</i>

08:35.200 --> 08:38.192
<i># Eagles, Eagles, we're number one!
So let's go have some fun!</i>

08:47.680 --> 08:49.432
<i>There she is, boys.</i>

08:49.560 --> 08:51.039
Mandy Lane.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.109
Untouched.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.195
Pure.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.072
Since the dawn of junior year,
men have tried to possess her,

08:59.200 --> 09:02.476
and to date, all have failed.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.795
Some have even died
in their reckless pursuit of this angel.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.757
I've invited her out to my ranch
this weekend.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.279
My kingdom.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.517
So I ask you, gentlemen,
am I the shit?

09:17.720 --> 09:20.678
To which I reply, yes, I am.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.633
But will she come?

09:30.400 --> 09:31.913
Hey!

09:32.040 --> 09:33.029
Hi.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.319
Chloe! Chloe, listen.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.351
- Fuck off, Red.
- Is she in?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.516
I'm working on it.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.835
<i>Let's water up!</i>

09:57.920 --> 09:59.148
What's up, man?

09:59.280 --> 10:02.192
<i>She better come, dude.</i>

10:03.120 --> 10:04.633
<i>She'll be there.</i>

10:04.760 --> 10:06.273
And I got first dibs.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.317
Yeah, we'll see about that.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.192
I can see your nipples.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.835
Obviously.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.595
- How do you get 'em that hard?
- It's a secret.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.797
<i>You go, Mandy Lane!</i>

10:22.920 --> 10:25.753
<i># Talking about us, telling lies</i>

10:25.880 --> 10:28.235
<i># Well, that's a surprise</i>

10:28.360 --> 10:30.999
<i># Can you see them?
See right through them?</i>

10:31.960 --> 10:35.873
<i># They have no shield,
nothing must be revealed</i>

10:36.000 --> 10:38.958
<i># It doesn't matter what they say</i>

10:39.080 --> 10:42.629
<i># In the jealous games people play</i>

10:44.480 --> 10:45.879
<i># Our lips are sealed</i>

10:46.000 --> 10:47.672
<i>Mandy!</i>

10:49.360 --> 10:50.952
Finished it.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.353
Not now, Emmet.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.792
Um, Mandy's, like, busy.
She doesn't have time for love poems.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.917
Creepy boy.
Can't he take a fucking hint?

11:02.040 --> 11:04.952
Not friend any more.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.029
<i>Go jump off a roof, Emmet.</i>

11:16.440 --> 11:18.908
Check out what I just got.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.439
Is it contagious?

11:20.560 --> 11:23.313
Does it explain that thing
on your face?

11:25.240 --> 11:29.677
<i>Whatever,
smarty-cunt. Seriously, check it out.</i>

11:29.800 --> 11:31.597
Tasty, huh?

11:31.720 --> 11:34.473
Marlin, don't get me wrong,
but you're all pudge.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.830
That thing's gonna get lost
in the folds.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.632
I'm not fat.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.594
OK.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.472
I think it's nice, Marlin.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.477
Hey! You're coming this weekend,
right?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.194
- Right.
- You OKed it with your aunt?

11:53.320 --> 11:55.550
- I will.
- Well, you'd better.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.955
You only finish junior year once.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.908
<i>Shit, dude!</i>

12:05.040 --> 12:06.917
She's coming.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.434
She's coming to my ranch, dude!

12:11.360 --> 12:14.113
Hey, Jake? Hmm?

12:15.640 --> 12:17.312
I got first dibs though.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.752
No, you don't!
Say it again, man. Say it again.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.350
I don't need to say it again.
I only say things once.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.311
Emmet's not going, is he?

12:32.440 --> 12:34.317
No.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.839
Bird's going.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.799
Hold on! How many boys are going?

12:39.920 --> 12:42.115
Aunt Jo, I can take care of myself.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.151
- I know.
- These people invited me.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.114
New friends. Don't you think
I should make new friends?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.276
Wouldn't that be, like, good for me?

12:50.400 --> 12:53.437
It is good to see you playing
with this new crowd.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.472
- They seem very mature.
- They are.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.956
And... And responsible and normal.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.915
Just give her permission, Mother.
It seems to be going in that direction.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.156
My parents would let me go.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.796
- OK.
- Thanks.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.313
But be careful.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.273
I will, I will. Thank you, Aunt Jo.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.958
Would you like to hit this? Would you?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.991
<i>What's with all these marks?</i>

14:28.120 --> 14:30.998
Jake's hooked up with a girl
from each of those states.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.395
There's, like, 40 states in California.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.511
42.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.632
And the fucker's parents
are taking him to Alaska in August.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.596
So who gets it this weekend?

14:41.720 --> 14:43.199
Chloe.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.833
And Mandy.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.632
Yeah, right.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.557
At the same time.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.637
Has Jake said anything about
getting back together with me?

14:52.760 --> 14:54.910
Not that I can think of.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.713
Would you even tell me if he did?

14:57.840 --> 14:58.829
No, ma'am.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.632
<i>Damn it!</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:02.955
I am trying to fuck your best friend
here.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.196
- Give me a little cooperation.
- Alright.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.391
<i># Well, I keep on thinking 'bout you</i>

15:15.520 --> 15:20.913
<i># Sister golden hair surprise</i>

15:21.040 --> 15:24.919
<i># And I just can't live without you</i>

15:25.040 --> 15:29.830
<i># Can't you see it in my eyes?</i>

15:29.960 --> 15:34.670
<i># I've been one poor correspondent</i>

15:34.800 --> 15:39.157
<i># I've been too, too hard to find</i>

15:39.280 --> 15:46.436
<i># But it doesn't mean
you ain't been on my mind</i>

15:48.880 --> 15:53.317
<i># Will you meet me in the middle?</i>

15:53.440 --> 15:57.956
<i># Will you meet me in the air?</i>

15:58.080 --> 16:02.710
<i># Will you love me just a little?</i>

16:02.840 --> 16:06.833
<i># Just enough to show you care?</i>

16:06.960 --> 16:10.714
<i># Well, I tried to fake it</i>

16:10.840 --> 16:12.990
<i># I don't mind saying</i>

16:13.120 --> 16:15.315
<i># I just can't make it</i>

16:16.760 --> 16:19.752
Hey, man, Check this out.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.310
- Oh, shit!
- Whiteout on three?

16:23.440 --> 16:26.637
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, fucking blue 42 and shit.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.638
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

16:33.720 --> 16:35.950
Excuse me?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.559
- Sir?
- Yeah?

16:37.680 --> 16:41.389
Can I get some directions? You know
your way around here pretty good?

16:41.520 --> 16:44.080
Is this a map? I know some things.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.395
We're looking for the 305.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.030
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.998
Thank God for little brothers with ADD.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.553
How's that working out?

17:03.680 --> 17:06.592
- Has his behaviour improved?
- Whatever.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.508
Dude, you gotta trim that thing!

17:20.319 --> 17:21.912
Fucking Sherwood Forest!

17:27.000 --> 17:29.833
- Well, here's 71.
- Hm-hmm.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.791
I don't know the 305.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.831
- Never heard of it?
- No.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.394
<i>This is where we are, right here.</i>

17:36.520 --> 17:37.669
Alright.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.031
But I don't see it on here, son.
I just don't see it.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.152
Well, thanks for trying, man.
We'll, uh...

17:44.280 --> 17:46.236
- Good luck to you, man.
- Thanks a lot.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.873
Whoa!

17:49.640 --> 17:55.954
Now, those are some mighty
fine-looking ladies. Yeah, they are!

17:56.080 --> 17:57.991
<i>Alright, man.</i>

17:58.120 --> 17:59.997
Thanks, asshole.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.269
Hey!

18:04.440 --> 18:06.271
- Hey!
- Shit!

18:14.120 --> 18:16.315
Man, did y'all see Lane?

18:16.440 --> 18:19.876
She was, like, a pro
with the getaway vehicle.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.309
Let's rob a bank, huh?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.476
You totally corrupted her, Jake.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.471
What the hell's going on back there?

19:23.600 --> 19:27.275
There is no fucking way
I am taking my car in there.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.119
My dad will kill me if I scratch it.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.755
<i>It's cool.
There's room in here. Sit on laps.</i>

19:33.880 --> 19:36.075
Uh, I'd like to walk.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.078
You guys are not walking.
It's another mile to the ranch.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.269
Are you kidding?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.630
Fuck that. I am not walking.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.274
OK.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.389
I'm game.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.796
I'll send the ranch hand
back down for y'all.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.635
And there won't be much time
for walking,

19:54.760 --> 19:58.435
or, uh... anything else, Bird.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.953
I guess they'll be talking
when we get back.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.308
Talking?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.033
About us.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.469
You know we're all trying
to get you, right?

20:29.440 --> 20:30.919
Get me?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.559
Get with you.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.671
Look, here's the deal.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.035
I'm not like the other guys.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.513
I mean, I love 'em.

20:42.640 --> 20:47.316
They're my boys an' all,
but... I'm just not like them.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.431
I have respect for the woman.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.837
I can see that.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.116
Can I hold your hand?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.552
Can I kiss you?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.919
It's just a kiss.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.075
Hey. Don't mean to disturb y'all,

21:39.200 --> 21:42.476
but Red asked me to circle round
and bring you up to the house.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.718
I'm Garth.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.595
Mandy Lane.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.630
And I think we should get going.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.273
Alright, hop in.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.148
Hold on.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.635
Pull!

22:14.960 --> 22:16.439
Oh, yeah!

22:26.040 --> 22:27.393
Thanks.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.437
Welcome to paradise, dudes! Yeah!

22:37.720 --> 22:39.517
<i>Hi, Mandy.</i>

22:50.960 --> 22:52.279
<i>Don't worry.</i>

22:52.400 --> 22:54.630
I'm not planning on sleeping in here.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.716
- You're not?
- Please!

22:56.840 --> 23:00.310
I'm gonna sleep in a room
with a boy in it, thank you.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.637
Maybe go visit Garth,
the cowboy babe.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.034
The ranch hand?

23:05.160 --> 23:08.311
<i>Like you didn't notice.</i>

23:08.440 --> 23:10.431
This useless piece of shit!

23:10.560 --> 23:14.189
Let's go.
It's time to get you ladies wet.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.951
Meet us at the lake.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.155
<i>- Sure you don't want company?
- Like you could keep up.</i>

24:01.680 --> 24:02.795
You bitch!

24:15.080 --> 24:17.150
<i>- Nice, nice, nice!
- Mandy!</i>

24:17.280 --> 24:19.999
Come on in, the water's good.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.394
Get in!

24:28.120 --> 24:29.189
Shit!

24:52.200 --> 24:53.519
Jesus.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.188
Damn!

25:07.360 --> 25:09.590
Oh, my! I'm gonna say it, man!

25:09.720 --> 25:12.075
Mandy, I love you!
I love everything about you.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.078
<i>Your aunt and your cousin Jen.</i>

25:16.800 --> 25:18.153
<i>Come here, baby.</i>

25:18.960 --> 25:20.951
- Come here, baby.
- I love it.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.399
Jake!

25:24.760 --> 25:26.113
<i>He got it!</i>

25:26.240 --> 25:27.514
Hey!

25:27.640 --> 25:29.756
<i>- Give 'em to me!
- And she's naked.</i>

25:30.800 --> 25:33.109
Jake! Damn it!

25:35.240 --> 25:37.435
Jake! Jake! No!

25:54.480 --> 25:56.152
Shit!

25:56.280 --> 25:57.554
Nice shot, man.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.795
Jesus!

25:58.920 --> 26:03.198
Throw a few rocks before you go
swimming. Give the snakes fair warning.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.517
Good Lord, Garth! Goddamn!

26:09.760 --> 26:11.193
Thanks, dude.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.349
Thank you.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.113
<i>Now I could really use a drink.</i>

26:27.560 --> 26:28.709
Thank you.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.635
We got an ace.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.988
<i>Waterfall!</i>

26:59.400 --> 27:01.038
It's your turn, Red.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.354
Thank you.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.797
Truth or dare?

27:07.120 --> 27:08.314
Truth or dare?

27:08.440 --> 27:09.668
Dare.

27:09.800 --> 27:14.430
Go out to the barn
and, uh... suck off the horse.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.070
You are such a sick little fuck.

27:18.200 --> 27:22.557
We agreed an R rating, remember?
That's triple X. That's creepy.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.874
<i>You're drunk!</i>

27:24.000 --> 27:25.956
<i>I get to go.</i>

27:26.080 --> 27:27.752
Truth or dare?

27:27.880 --> 27:30.599
<i>Mandy?</i>

27:31.920 --> 27:33.478
Mandy?

27:34.480 --> 27:35.879
Truth or dare?

27:36.760 --> 27:38.751
<i>- Dare.
- Yeah!</i>

27:38.880 --> 27:41.474
Go outside and invite Garth
to join us.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.670
<i>- What? No. Don't.
- Why?</i>

27:43.800 --> 27:45.074
Do!

27:45.200 --> 27:46.633
OK.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.308
<i>What? No, stop that!
He could...</i>

27:50.440 --> 27:54.319
Seriously, don't sneak up on him
or anything. He might shoot you.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.351
I think I'll be OK.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.073
Garth?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.428
Hey, Garth?

28:35.440 --> 28:36.475
Garth?

28:36.600 --> 28:38.238
You in there?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.196
- You looking for me?
- No.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.710
Yeah. Um...

28:49.080 --> 28:51.548
I was just... getting some air.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.235
Wondering if you, you know...

28:57.080 --> 28:58.559
...wanted some.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.238
Air?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.989
Uh... company.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.473
Actually...

29:06.640 --> 29:10.428
...they kind of dared me to come out here
and invite you in for a drink.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.432
Uh...

29:17.760 --> 29:19.273
So you wanna come?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.678
I do, but... I can't.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.637
I don't think Red's father
would approve.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.954
Yeah.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.389
It's silly that we're all inside.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.796
Well, they all seem to be
doing alright in there.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.074
Well...

29:49.200 --> 29:51.714
- Sure you don't wanna come in?
- Pretty sure.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.799
Well, um... OK.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.875
Bye.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.276
<i>Red, who told you it was cool
to wear shorts and cowboy boots?</i>

30:04.400 --> 30:07.836
<i>Marlin, have you ever had
a lesbian experience?</i>

30:07.960 --> 30:10.679
<i>When was the last time
you jerked off?</i>

30:10.800 --> 30:13.519
<i>Have you ever seen
your dad's wiener?</i>

30:13.640 --> 30:15.790
Is it true what they
say about black guys?

30:15.920 --> 30:17.319
I don't know. Is it?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.237
Your dad's gay, right?

30:20.120 --> 30:22.315
When are you gonna give up
that cherry?

30:22.440 --> 30:25.637
<i>- When are you gonna give up yours?
- Ooh!</i>

30:25.760 --> 30:26.795
Spit or swallow?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.150
Who has the smallest pecker
in the room?

30:34.280 --> 30:37.397
<i>Who does have the smallest package
in the room?</i>

30:41.160 --> 30:42.912
<i>What?</i>

30:45.240 --> 30:46.229
Sorry, Jake.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.956
<i>Sorry!</i>

30:50.080 --> 30:53.152
<i>- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- It's just a joke.</i>

30:53.280 --> 30:56.352
Come on, man, take it easy.
Have another drink.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.234
- Why don't we take a break, guys?
- No! We're just getting started.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.397
Not a big deal, dude.
Not a big deal. Chill.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.988
Really, it's... not a big deal.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.750
Know what? Fuck you guys.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.917
- Jake...
- Let him go. What do you care?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.519
You don't know when to quit.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.073
Blow me, chubs.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.555
Fuck you!

31:20.680 --> 31:24.229
What the fuck? You whore!

31:26.120 --> 31:28.031
What the fuck does she care?

31:32.280 --> 31:33.872
Oh, my God.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.673
She's totally in love with Jake.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.874
Jake?

31:51.320 --> 31:52.958
Come on, Jake.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.871
I didn't mean it was small.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.958
I just meant
it was the smallest one at the table.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.153
Jake?

32:32.440 --> 32:35.637
C'mon, Jake. It was just a joke.

32:37.640 --> 32:38.709
Hey.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.155
- There you are. You OK?
- That was bullshit.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.989
- Poor baby...
- No, don't "poor baby" me.

32:48.280 --> 32:49.998
Let me see if I can help.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.680
You've helped enough. Stop it, Marlin!

33:15.120 --> 33:18.874
See? It gets big when it gets hard.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.719
They all get big when they get hard.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.389
Assholes!

33:59.960 --> 34:00.915
Shit!

34:08.360 --> 34:10.590
- Better?
- Oh, yeah.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.549
My turn.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.476
Let's go finish the game.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.353
Wait. Jake,
you're gonna go down on me, right?

34:18.480 --> 34:20.869
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

34:21.000 --> 34:23.275
Why don't you go get Red to do you?

34:25.360 --> 34:28.556
I am sick and tired
of you fucking little boys.

34:30.120 --> 34:34.159
I'm gonna go fuck the cowboy, Jake!
You fucking little prick!

34:35.320 --> 34:39.871
Come on, Jake. It's dark in here.
I can't see.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.438
Jake, come on.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.949
Jake?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.750
Come on, it's not funny any more.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.879
Nobody say shit about his cock.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.191
Where's Marlin?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.914
She mentioned something
about fucking the maid.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.508
Ranch hand, dude.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.755
Whatever.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.234
Will y'all get me a beer?

37:05.360 --> 37:06.793
- No.
- No.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.033
Fine. Anybody else want a beer?

37:18.160 --> 37:20.515
- No, thanks.
- Alright.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.952
Ah, shit!

37:33.960 --> 37:35.029
Perfect.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.517
Yep.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.709
Perfect.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.719
Jake, go get Garth
to start the genny, OK?

37:45.840 --> 37:46.875
Hell, no.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.275
I just got you a beer.

37:50.200 --> 37:54.478
<i>- Probably busy boning Marlin anyway.
- Somebody help me!</i>

37:55.400 --> 37:57.994
- Dude, go help Chloe.
- No way, bro.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.073
Someone should go outside
and sort the generator.

38:09.960 --> 38:13.350
<i>- Fuck it, I'll do it.
- I'm serious!</i>

38:14.400 --> 38:16.470
I'll go help Chloe.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.709
Um, I should go get the candles.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.473
<i>Hey!</i>

39:19.760 --> 39:20.715
Hey.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.352
So where is everyone?

39:27.680 --> 39:29.352
They're all fucking.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.073
Really?

39:32.200 --> 39:34.430
<i>And just where are you, Mandy Lane?</i>

39:35.480 --> 39:37.516
Right here.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.639
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40:10.760 --> 40:13.911
Oh, uh, trying to get the power
back on.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.473
Right.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.352
Red check the fuse box?

40:20.480 --> 40:22.550
I think I can get it started.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.796
Don't you have a girlfriend in there?

40:26.920 --> 40:29.480
Yeah, I think I might.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.830
Well, I'd run back in there
before I lose her.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.791
What the hell are you talking about?

40:33.920 --> 40:38.789
We're on the grid here. Power ain't
got nothing to do with the generator.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.392
Those little fuckers.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.350
Hope they get the power
turned back on.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.674
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.798
Yeah, I thought we could use
some alone time.

41:02.920 --> 41:03.989
Jake.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.269
What?

41:10.640 --> 41:12.710
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

41:16.960 --> 41:19.190
You know what?

41:19.320 --> 41:22.517
You walk around this place
like you think you're better than us.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.155
- I do not think I'm better...
- And you know what? You're not.

41:26.280 --> 41:30.273
Shit! I think we're pretty much
on the same page here, don't you?

41:30.400 --> 41:34.598
In fact, Lane,
I think we're a lot alike.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.119
You want what I want.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.592
Turn the power back on, Jake.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.316
Why the fuck did you come here anyway?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.559
Good question.

41:54.040 --> 41:58.431
Hey, look, I understand you.
I really do.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.235
- Don't forget that shit.
- I don't have a problem with Marlin.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.477
But if that fat bitch
has a better chance at Jake than I do,

42:06.600 --> 42:09.637
then why is it my fault
that she has body-image issues?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.910
Like, that's her problem, you know?

42:12.040 --> 42:17.353
She makes a choice to be fat,
so it's totally all on her, you know?

42:18.400 --> 42:21.153
It's like... what does that
have to do with me?

42:21.280 --> 42:24.272
What does that have to do with Jake,
you know?

42:24.400 --> 42:25.549
It's like...

42:27.200 --> 42:28.838
You know what I mean?

42:30.080 --> 42:32.355
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.669
You OK?

42:42.800 --> 42:45.837
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.712
Yeah, she's fine.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.558
And I'm bored.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.636
Messing with the fuse box wasn't fun?

42:51.760 --> 42:55.639
Oh, no. No, that was fun.
It was fun, wasn't it, Mandy?

42:57.360 --> 42:59.237
Thanks for starting up the genny.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.237
Fuck you!

43:01.360 --> 43:05.239
Come on, Bird. We were just playing
with you, man. We cool?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.478
OK.

43:08.600 --> 43:12.354
Hey, Chloe, how about a swim?
Skinny-dip.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.358
Just you, me
and the beautiful creature again.

43:16.800 --> 43:20.918
I'm sorry, um... didn't you,
like, fuck Marlin tonight?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.315
I did, actually. Lane?

43:25.680 --> 43:27.796
Last chance to get a piece.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.870
Well, back to the well, then.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.752
No. No, no, no, no. No keys.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.711
Jake, you can't drive.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.831
- Jake, please!
- Don't wait up, ladies!

43:37.960 --> 43:42.829
Hilarious! Give me the fucking keys!
Jake, give me the fucking gun, dude!

43:51.160 --> 43:52.513
Marlin!

43:55.520 --> 43:57.988
Where you at, you crazy bitch?

44:07.040 --> 44:08.075
Marlin!

44:22.960 --> 44:25.679
<i># Well, I keep on thinking
'bout you</i>

44:25.800 --> 44:29.270
<i># Sister golden hair surprise</i>

44:29.400 --> 44:31.630
<i># And I just can't live without you</i>

44:31.760 --> 44:35.355
<i># Can't you see it in my eyes?</i>

44:35.480 --> 44:38.358
<i># And I've been one poor correspondent</i>

44:38.480 --> 44:43.076
<i># I've been too, too hard to find</i>

44:44.720 --> 44:48.838
<i># But it doesn't mean
you ain't been on my mind</i>

44:53.080 --> 44:55.753
<i># Won't you meet me in the middle?</i>

44:55.880 --> 44:58.519
<i>- # Won't you meet me in the air?
- Marlin?</i>

44:58.640 --> 45:01.234
<i># Won't you love me just a little?</i>

45:09.880 --> 45:12.440
What the fuck?

45:23.960 --> 45:25.359
Marlin?

45:26.640 --> 45:28.710
That you, babe?

45:34.200 --> 45:36.919
Hey! What are you doing?

45:42.800 --> 45:44.791
Are you crying or puking?

45:48.520 --> 45:50.954
Not that it makes much difference
to me, but...

45:52.080 --> 45:54.196
Nah, I'm just playing with you.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.435
Here,

45:55.560 --> 45:57.357
have a drink.

45:57.480 --> 46:00.074
Don't give me the silent treatment.
Have a drink.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.918
It'll make you feel better.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.439
C'mon, baby, have a drink.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.675
Come on, have a drink.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.189
Oh, shit!

46:11.800 --> 46:12.835
Hey!

46:15.440 --> 46:17.237
<i>Who the fuck?</i>

47:07.880 --> 47:10.633
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you guys hear that?

47:10.760 --> 47:12.398
It's just Jake messing around.

47:12.520 --> 47:16.559
No, no, no. He's drunk
and he's in a truck and he's got a gun.

47:16.680 --> 47:18.079
OK, that's bad.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.997
<i>Shit!</i>

47:20.120 --> 47:21.838
- Bird, go get him.
- Fuck that.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.679
I'm not doing it.
He's been an asshole all night.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.393
Don't look at me!
I'm not going out there to get shot.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.397
Yeah, just let him cool off.

47:32.360 --> 47:36.273
Oh, my God! OK, fine.
I will go get him myself.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.753
Damn it!

47:48.200 --> 47:53.479
<i>I heard a gunshot.
What the hell's going on here, Red?</i>

48:02.640 --> 48:06.315
<i># Eagles, Eagles, we're the best!</i>

48:06.440 --> 48:09.591
<i># Better than all the rest!</i>

48:11.720 --> 48:13.597
<i># We're number one!</i>

48:13.720 --> 48:15.312
<i># E-A-G-L-E-S!</i>

48:15.440 --> 48:17.670
<i># Let's have some fucking fun!</i>

48:20.720 --> 48:23.632
<i># Go... Eagles!</i>

48:24.560 --> 48:27.597
<i>Look, I don't care
what you do. I really don't.</i>

48:27.720 --> 48:32.157
But if you're drinking and whatever,
I don't wanna know, right?

48:32.280 --> 48:33.952
I don't need to know.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.753
<i>- It's not us.
- But no guns.</i>

48:36.880 --> 48:38.711
You're the one with the gun.

48:40.600 --> 48:44.036
You've been drinking a lot and doing
a lot of whatever you're doing,

48:44.160 --> 48:46.958
so I'd suggest
you call it a night, alright?

48:47.800 --> 48:50.633
- Take it, man. We're done.
- I'm not gonna take it, Red.

48:50.760 --> 48:55.117
Just sit tight and wait till
the morning. We'll have a big time then.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.232
I would feel much safer
if you were here.

48:58.360 --> 49:01.079
Well, I'm leaving, darling.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.276
Oh, and, uh...
if I hear one more gunshot,

49:05.400 --> 49:07.356
I'm calling your dad.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.953
<i>Lane? Lane?</i>

49:57.240 --> 49:59.196
Is he single?

50:00.400 --> 50:02.834
Why the sudden interest
in the ranch hand?

50:02.960 --> 50:06.509
<i>Just curious, that's all.</i>

50:06.640 --> 50:08.153
Hmm.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.874
So, well, is he?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.036
Well...

50:13.160 --> 50:17.517
Well, he was married and then
his... his wife died tragically.

50:17.640 --> 50:21.189
Oh, my God. That poor thing.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.118
<i>He's poor alright.</i>

50:24.240 --> 50:26.800
<i>I bet your mom likes him.</i>

50:26.920 --> 50:30.037
Yeah. Both my parents like him.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.628
They love having a marine
around the house.

50:32.760 --> 50:35.069
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

50:35.200 --> 50:39.273
<i>A cowboy and a soldier?
I just got wet.</i>

50:39.400 --> 50:42.233
You know, Ned Willis
was trying to recruit me.

50:43.280 --> 50:47.398
I think he got traumatised by the
Gulf War. He saw a lot of people die.

50:47.520 --> 50:50.830
- He doesn't seem traumatised.
- Nah, he's just like that.

50:50.960 --> 50:54.111
The guy's seriously traumatised.
Classic shell shock.

50:54.240 --> 50:56.913
Oh, my God. Can I just go hug him?

50:57.040 --> 51:00.350
That is so sad. So sad.

51:19.560 --> 51:24.429
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just saw somebody covered in blood!

51:24.560 --> 51:28.030
You put so much shit up your nose,
I don't believe a word you say.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.151
No, I mean it. I just saw somebody!

51:30.280 --> 51:33.955
- Hey, Chloe, it's been a long night.
- I swear to God, I saw someone.

51:34.080 --> 51:37.072
There's nobody out there.
There's nobody for miles.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.553
Look, I'll prove it.

51:38.680 --> 51:41.148
- No! Red!
- I'm gonna prove it to you.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.909
There's nobody.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.439
No, uh...

51:59.560 --> 52:01.949
Fuck! Get down, get down, get down!

52:03.200 --> 52:05.555
There's no one out there.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.752
<i>Chloe? Chloe, are you OK?</i>

52:13.680 --> 52:16.672
- Yeah.
- I think we're all just real tired.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.717
I'm fine.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.831
Whoa! Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:23.960 --> 52:26.315
<i>You OK?</i>

52:26.440 --> 52:28.795
- I'm fucked.
- Sit down.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.750
I have to go to the bathroom.

52:39.480 --> 52:41.630
I don't want to go by myself.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.109
OK. OK, let's go. Yeah?

52:46.240 --> 52:48.196
OK, I got you.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.353
OK.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.116
<i>Where's the light?</i>

53:32.520 --> 53:35.592
OK, girl. Yeah? You're safe?

53:35.720 --> 53:36.835
Hm-hmm.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.474
- You'll be fine. You're calm.
- Hmm.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.068
- Right?
- Hm-hmm.

53:42.200 --> 53:46.239
<i>- Like a monk.
- Yeah, right.</i>

53:47.120 --> 53:49.076
Oh.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.316
Thank God.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.678
Yeah? See?

54:09.800 --> 54:11.711
You're gonna be fine.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.398
Thanks.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.034
Your hands are shaking. Are you OK?

54:26.160 --> 54:28.116
Yeah. I'm fine.

54:31.200 --> 54:33.839
Jake and Bird both tried to kiss me.

54:34.960 --> 54:36.916
They did?

54:41.160 --> 54:45.995
- You're so much prettier than me.
- Chloe...

54:46.120 --> 54:48.395
No.

54:48.520 --> 54:50.636
You are. It's fine.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.673
This will make you calm.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.438
- Hmm?
- Open up.

55:00.560 --> 55:01.993
- No, no.
- Yeah.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.836
Now swallow.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.436
Swallow.

55:26.360 --> 55:30.478
Hi. We got a little impatient. Sorry.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.916
That's nice.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.718
- You good?
- I'm fading.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.832
We should all crash,
at least for a couple of hours.

55:50.960 --> 55:53.520
Yeah. Jake and Marlin
can find their way home.

55:53.640 --> 55:58.111
Yeah. Probably asleep already,
cuddled up under some juniper bush.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.516
Y'all want to go inside?

56:03.800 --> 56:06.712
There's plenty of beds.
We can all, uh...

56:06.840 --> 56:10.753
I'm not gonna make suggestions.
It'd be weird to make suggestions.

56:10.880 --> 56:13.075
<i>We'll figure something out.</i>

56:13.200 --> 56:14.679
OK.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.792
<i>Here he is.</i>

56:18.960 --> 56:21.952
<i>OK. He's gonna want attention.
Just ignore him.</i>

56:22.080 --> 56:23.672
Don't fucking indulge him.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.998
Hey, jackass!

56:29.040 --> 56:30.393
Oh!

56:31.040 --> 56:33.998
Oh! Fuck you, man! What's going on?

56:38.360 --> 56:40.316
Fuck this shit.

56:41.280 --> 56:45.831
<i>- Bird! Bird, come back here!
- You fucking bastard!</i>

56:49.040 --> 56:50.996
Bird!

56:53.360 --> 56:55.635
Garth, listen, I'll straighten this out.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.910
Man, Garth. Please, dude.
Dude, please.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.110
OK, now I am begging you. I implore you.

57:00.240 --> 57:03.391
Please do not pick up the phone.
Don't call my dad. Do not...

57:03.520 --> 57:08.719
Please, I take full responsibility.
Nothing burned. We're OK, we're fine.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.115
Garth... Please.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.431
You rock. Thank God.

57:18.560 --> 57:21.757
Dude, you can... go back to sleep.

57:21.880 --> 57:23.836
I'm not going anywhere, buddy.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.192
OK, dude, but, you know...

57:28.760 --> 57:30.716
Hey, Jake!

57:33.680 --> 57:35.636
Jake, man, you need to chill.

57:36.880 --> 57:39.030
Hey, Bird. Hop in.

57:39.160 --> 57:42.835
Emmet? Now, what the fuck
are you doing here?

57:42.960 --> 57:46.430
<i>Get in the truck.</i>

57:47.640 --> 57:49.949
What, you gonna shoot me?

57:59.800 --> 58:03.270
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- She having fun in there?

58:03.400 --> 58:05.960
- What's going on in there? Is it fun?
- Answer me!

58:06.080 --> 58:08.719
I saw you try and kiss her today,
out on the road.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.513
- What are you talking about?
- What did she taste like?

58:19.400 --> 58:23.552
- Where the fuck is Jake and Marlin?
- Doesn't matter.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.955
I'm not even here right now.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.116
I'll be dead in the morning.

58:29.240 --> 58:32.357
And you, you won't even
fucking make it that far.

58:32.480 --> 58:34.198
You're just like all the rest.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.914
Rest of who, man? Who's dead?

58:37.040 --> 58:39.474
You're not listening!

58:39.600 --> 58:41.318
Everyone.

58:46.880 --> 58:51.112
Over here. What's the matter, Bird?
Where you going, buddy?

58:54.840 --> 58:57.593
Oh, Birdy, Birdy, Birdy, Birdy.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.516
<i>Where am I?</i>

59:05.440 --> 59:07.396
I'm over here.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.477
Can't you see?

59:22.280 --> 59:24.236
I'm sorry, Bird.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.076
No, I'm not.

59:34.120 --> 59:37.590
About 40 head.
Most of them had real bad lesions

59:37.720 --> 59:39.915
and a lot were dropping calves.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.508
What happened to them?

59:42.640 --> 59:45.234
My dad had to sell 'em
to the neighbour.

59:49.160 --> 59:53.995
Your dad didn't sell the herd, Red.
You can't sell 'em when they're sick.

59:54.120 --> 59:56.350
So what did you do to 'em?

59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.393
Well, it's the only thing
that you can do. I put 'em down.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.356
- Well, my dad said...
- He said to take care of 'em and I did.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.234
Single-handedly.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.351
Leave it alone, Red.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.516
You shot them.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.031
Yeah. I shot 'em.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.800
Well, I just admire you, so...

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.558
Hm-hmm.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.477
Will you protect us from the bandits?

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.351
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.836
- How about teenage boys?
- Yeah, them, too.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.632
<i># Maybe I'm the one
who's already gone</i>

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.111
<i># Cold in the ground or fast asleep</i>

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.196
<i># Tonight</i>

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.111
<i># Some days I don't know
if I've grown too cold</i>

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:11.190
<i># Grown too old
and left without saying goodbye</i>

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.436
<i># Goodbye</i>

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.878
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.997
Chloe gave me this... pill.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.356
Made me really tired.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.472
God, I can't sleep.
Don't let me fall asleep.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.556
Coffee will help.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.470
It's an odd group of friends.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.556
Yeah.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.468
You seem... I don't know. Different.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.229
It's cos I am.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.755
My parents died when I was little.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.951
Sorry to hear that.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.468
Somebody did a good job raising you.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.068
My aunt.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.758
She took me in.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.275
Wouldn't have a sister, say,
about ten years older, would you?

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.594
Cousin Jen.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.950
She's 21.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.910
She'd do a number
on a nice man like you.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.359
Oh, yeah?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.830
I don't think they're coming back.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.275
<i>Hi.
You've reached Robert, Nora, Emmet...</i>

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.709
<i>They killed. They started to kill.</i>

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.628
<i>Now, what's going to happen here
in a matter of few minutes is that...</i>

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.789
<i>... being so bewildered with
many, many pressures on my brain,</i>

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.879
<i>seeing all these people behave
so treasonous. It was too much for me.</i>

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.188
You OK?

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.748
<i>Mandy?</i>

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.835
I think we need to get out of here.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.117
Hey. We need to get up, OK?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.470
What's going on?
You guys are scaring me.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.551
Garth, Garth!

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.239
<i>- Where did you get hit?
- I got hit here.</i>

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.634
<i>It's OK.</i>

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.354
Chloe, we're gonna get out of this, OK?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.393
<i>- We're so fucked.
- It's dead.</i>

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.551
Somebody's out there!

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.159
<i>- Who?
- I don't know.</i>

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.193
- I need to get you all to a car.
- I'm not leaving you alone.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.356
I'll go.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.835
Look, I brought us here.
I'll get us out.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.316
Do you think they're OK?
Jake and Bird?

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.953
And Marlin?

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.355
Go. Out the back. Go.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.271
<i>Go.</i>

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.475
Wait! I'll go with you.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.156
Let me see this.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.268
<i>- Come on.
- Go on. I can't!</i>

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.676
Come on. Let's go. Stick together.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.075
I can't breathe any more.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.836
Oh, God!

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.269
- Listen to me. Let's go!
- Just leave me here!

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.152
Chloe! Listen, we'll walk.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.430
But they're waiting!

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.235
<i>Thank God!</i>

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.316
It's totally OK.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.678
No!

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.270
<i>Get up!</i>

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.755
Oh! Get up!

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.916
Please get up. Get up!

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.591
<i>Please.</i>

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.116
In my cabin, the keys to the Jeep. Go.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.876
Oh, God!

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.597
<i>Look at you go, Chloe!
You got nowhere to fucking go!</i>

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.280
Fucking freak! Fucking whore!

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.596
Huh, bitch? Whoo-hoo!

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.678
Oh, God!

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.757
Mandy!

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.030
Mandy!

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.149
Chloe!

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.235
Come here, Chloe! Chloe!

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.752
Come here!

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.868
- I'm here, I'm here. Shh.
- They're all dead.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.669
<i>They're all dead.</i>

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.995
Hush. It'll be OK, it'll be OK.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.113
What took you so long?

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.913
- Look how bloody you are.
- Yeah. It just keeps gushing.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.194
<i>You OK?</i>

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.039
Yeah. OK.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.236
Brought presents.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.876
No, no. You keep it.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.678
<i>It's good?</i>

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.234
Um...

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.671
I put everything in here, you know,
for the copycats and the cops.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.516
I think they'll appreciate it.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.548
- Will you sign it for me?
- Don't make fun of it.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.512
Mandy, it's the only way
any of them will understand.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.596
Alright.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.276
I never read it, anyway.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.473
Can I keep this, too?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.192
All yours.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.676
<i>So what now?</i>

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.433
I guess we do it.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.675
Um... I know we said
that we'd both take pills,

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.998
but I think you should take the pills
and then shoot me in the heart.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.073
But do it a bunch of times

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.873
cos they don't always die
the first time, like Jake.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.395
Oh, um, and just don't shoot my face
cos my mom would want an open casket.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.317
Emmet...

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.877
Here. Give me your hand.
I have to watch you do it.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.713
I mean, I trust you, but, you know...

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.994
<i>It's OK.</i>

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.680
Don't be scared.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.916
It's just us now.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.996
I'm not scared.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.158
Are you?

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.236
Take them.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.638
OK?

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.154
That's why you did all of this, right?

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.557
Is that what you wanted?

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.636
I'm doing it for you.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.319
You should never do anything for me.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.274
Mandy, don't.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.756
Hey, we had a plan.
We're gonna die now.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.950
One of us will.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.594
Help! Garth!

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.039
Help!

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.792
<i>Garth!</i>

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.390
No, no!

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.756
No!

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.511
Mandy!

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.238
Mandy!

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.352
- No!
- Stop it!

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.668
- Not so fast.
- Faster than you.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.119
Why are you fucking with me?

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.879
We did everything we wanted!
We're the only ones left!

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.397
I love you.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.080
You fucking knew that!

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.997
Let's just be friends.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.677
<i>We're different.</i>

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.791
You said so!

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.876
I did everything right!

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.509
You fucking die with me. Die with me!

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.874
<i>Die with me.</i>

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.913
<i>- Mandy, fucking die with me!
- Fuck you!</i>

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.114
Die with me!

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.358
I think I'll finish high school first.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.636
Garth.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:04.272
<i># Though we gotta say goodbye
for the summer</i>

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.993

<i># I'll send you all my love</i>
