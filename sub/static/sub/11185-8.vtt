(narrator)
This briefing is from File
A56-7W.

01:05.888 --> 01:07.321
Classified.: top secret.

01:07.389 --> 01:10.722
Subject is Airwolf, a
Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

01:10.793 --> 01:13.284
with the most advanced weapons
system in the air today.

01:13.362 --> 01:16.058
It has been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

01:16.132 --> 01:17.724
by its test pilot,
Stringfellow Hawke.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.768
Hawke has promised
to return Airwolf only

01:19.835 --> 01:22.827
if we can find his brother
St. John, an MIA in Vietnam.

01:22.905 --> 01:24.304
We suspect that Archangel,

01:24.373 --> 01:26.841
deputy director of the agency
that built Airwolf,

01:26.909 --> 01:29.275
is secretly helping Hawke
in return for Hawke's

01:29.345 --> 01:31.711
flying Airwolf on missions
of national concern.

01:31.780 --> 01:34.681
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

01:34.750 --> 01:36.911
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

01:36.986 --> 01:38.715
His only friend is
Dominic Santini,

01:38.787 --> 01:41.255
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

01:41.323 --> 01:43.188
With Hawke and Santini
flying as a team

01:43.259 --> 01:45.090
at speeds
rivaling the fastest jets

01:45.161 --> 01:46.753
backed by unmatched firepower,

01:46.829 --> 01:49.491
Airwolf is too dangerous to be
left in unenlightened hands.

01:49.565 --> 01:51.556
Finding it
is your first priority.

02:49.525 --> 02:52.392
[man speaking Spanish
on radio]

03:06.408 --> 03:08.433
[speaking in Spanish]

03:17.286 --> 03:18.981
[seagulls crying]

03:25.995 --> 03:27.656
[helicopter whirring]

03:29.298 --> 03:30.788
[speaking in Spanish]

03:45.614 --> 03:48.174
Uh-uh! It's show
and tell time, buddy.

03:48.784 --> 03:50.149
You go first.

03:50.252 --> 03:52.015
[speaking in Spanish]

03:56.258 --> 03:58.089
[men chattering]

04:32.895 --> 04:34.123
Welcome to Cuba.

04:34.196 --> 04:35.288
Yeah.

04:35.564 --> 04:38.624
To tell you the truth, l'll be
happy when l leave here.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.565
[speaking in Spanish]

04:40.669 --> 04:42.034
Can l talk to them?

04:42.104 --> 04:43.264
ln a minute.

04:43.739 --> 04:45.263
Can you untie their hands

04:45.341 --> 04:47.809
and then--then take those guns
out of their faces?

04:47.876 --> 04:49.002
ls it all here?

04:49.078 --> 04:50.978
Yeah, it's all there.
All $2 million of it.

04:51.046 --> 04:52.638
Go ahead and count it
if you want.

04:52.715 --> 04:54.080
l intend to.

04:54.149 --> 04:56.049
Those men could be
in better shape.

04:56.185 --> 04:58.085
They are no longer young.

04:58.787 --> 05:01.312
Besides, we don't
baby our criminals here.

05:01.523 --> 05:03.787
Senor Santini,
perhaps you don't...

05:05.127 --> 05:06.492
[guns firing]

05:09.264 --> 05:10.891
[speaking in Spanish]

05:39.795 --> 05:42.491
Did you think you could
get away with this?

05:42.598 --> 05:43.929
What do you mean?

05:43.999 --> 05:46.058
l had nothing to do
with that chopper.

05:46.135 --> 05:47.693
l delivered my end.

05:47.770 --> 05:50.466
Delivered what?
Bullet holes in the sand?

05:50.539 --> 05:52.370
You delivered nothing.

05:52.441 --> 05:54.306
Look, l came
to take those prisoners,

05:54.376 --> 05:56.276
and l'm gonna
take them back with me.

05:56.345 --> 05:59.872
l have executed men for less
than what you have just done.

06:00.749 --> 06:03.582
Those prisoners
cost you $2 million before.

06:04.486 --> 06:06.647
Now they cost $3 million.

06:07.956 --> 06:10.686
Take that message back
to United States.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.418
And what if l tell you
to go to hell?

06:13.796 --> 06:15.821
Then you will die. Here, now.

06:16.598 --> 06:19.567
And l will find another way
to deliver my message.

06:19.902 --> 06:21.995
Do you want to die
for nothing?

06:25.374 --> 06:26.864
Of course not.

06:28.644 --> 06:30.509
Get out of my country.

07:10.419 --> 07:12.046
Come on up, sweetheart.

07:21.463 --> 07:24.364
(Hawke)
Well, just what do you mean,
Santini is down?

07:24.433 --> 07:26.833
One of our listening posts
in southern Florida

07:26.902 --> 07:29.871
picked up a distress call
yesterday at 1900 hours.

07:29.938 --> 07:31.599
He heard the words
''Santini Air''

07:31.673 --> 07:32.867
and called it in.

07:33.075 --> 07:34.235
To the Coast Guard?

07:34.309 --> 07:35.435
No, to me.

07:36.178 --> 07:38.772
Does that mean no search
pattern has been started?

07:38.847 --> 07:41.839
He was, uh, over land
when he radioed in.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.581
We have a rough position.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.880
You know, anything can go
wrong in a forced landing.

07:47.956 --> 07:50.049
Why the hell haven't you
called out the troops?

07:50.125 --> 07:52.559
Because his course
triangulates back to Cuba.

07:52.628 --> 07:54.289
He filed no flight plan

07:54.363 --> 07:56.558
and reported his altitude
as 100 feet.

07:56.632 --> 07:58.497
lf the authorities
get to him first,

07:58.567 --> 08:01.559
the first thing they'll do to
him is hand him his Miranda.

08:01.637 --> 08:03.502
''You have the right
to remain silent.

08:03.572 --> 08:06.200
Anything you say can
and will be held against you.''

08:06.275 --> 08:08.743
What the hell
is Santini doing in Cuba?

08:09.611 --> 08:11.044
Why don't you ask him?

08:11.113 --> 08:12.102
l will.

08:12.180 --> 08:14.375
He's a man who knows
the location of Airwolf,

08:14.449 --> 08:15.438
and when he starts
junketing off

08:15.484 --> 08:18.009
to the land of rum
and fine cigars,

08:18.086 --> 08:19.883
l get a little concerned
about him.

08:19.955 --> 08:23.049
l'm goin' after him.
l'll tell him how you care.

08:23.158 --> 08:24.455
Do that.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.224
There is another
serious factor

08:26.261 --> 08:28.752
which might shorten your time.

08:29.531 --> 08:31.624
Who created this
serious factor?

08:32.833 --> 08:34.927
Only God
can create a hurricane.

08:35.003 --> 08:36.868
[thunder clapping]

09:00.128 --> 09:01.823
[electronic buzzing]

09:03.031 --> 09:05.329
Get it said, Michael.
I'm a busy man.

09:08.604 --> 09:10.162
What's your position, Hawke?

09:10.238 --> 09:11.865
Where are you sitting it out?

09:11.940 --> 09:13.669
(Hawke)
At 500 feet.

09:14.176 --> 09:15.734
Are you out of your mind?

09:19.147 --> 09:21.741
(Hawke)
Well, Airwolf's holding
up fine, but I think

09:21.817 --> 09:24.513
there's better designs
for chasing hurricanes.

09:24.586 --> 09:27.680
(Michael)
Set down immediately.
That's an order, do you hear?

09:27.756 --> 09:29.280
(Hawke)
You gotta be kiddin'.

09:29.358 --> 09:31.349
All right, it's not an order,
it's a request.

09:31.426 --> 09:33.291
Make it a plea for sanity.

09:33.362 --> 09:34.989
(Hawke)
No to all three.

09:35.063 --> 09:38.032
(Michael)
Hawke, the storm will be over
in a couple of hours.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.625
Don't let that angel title
go to your head.

09:40.702 --> 09:42.966
(Hawke)
Only God can make the weather.

09:50.445 --> 09:51.673
[sighing]

09:57.419 --> 09:59.319
[whooshing]

11:09.191 --> 11:10.624
[dog barking]

11:19.201 --> 11:21.328
(Dominic)
Larry, let me have another.

11:35.350 --> 11:37.147
Hey, String,
how'd you find me?

11:37.219 --> 11:38.948
Dom, you all right?
You're not hurt?

11:39.020 --> 11:40.715
Oh, l'm fine. l'm fine.

11:41.423 --> 11:43.653
l was just too down
to want to see anybody,

11:43.725 --> 11:45.215
but you're the exception.

11:45.293 --> 11:48.126
Sit down. Sit down. Hey,
give him a drink, will you?

11:48.263 --> 11:50.458
Aren't you gonna drink those?

11:50.532 --> 11:53.296
Well, no. You know l don't
like the taste of booze.

11:53.368 --> 11:55.962
[chuckling]
Well, then
why'd you order them?

11:56.738 --> 11:58.330
'Cause in the movies

11:58.406 --> 12:00.431
when the, uh--
When the world crashes in,

12:00.509 --> 12:02.977
the hero goes down to
the bar and orders drinks.

12:03.044 --> 12:04.705
l respect tradition.

12:04.780 --> 12:05.906
Does it work?

12:05.981 --> 12:07.107
Not yet.

12:08.316 --> 12:10.648
Give him another drink.
Have another drink?

12:10.719 --> 12:13.244
Oh, sure, l don't
like the stuff, either.

12:14.022 --> 12:16.149
How was the weather in Cuba?

12:16.591 --> 12:18.718
But how-- How did you know?

12:20.428 --> 12:23.022
Oh! Archangel.

12:24.065 --> 12:27.091
Yeah, one of his listening
posts picked up your mayday.

12:30.071 --> 12:32.005
String, in the last 24 hours,

12:32.073 --> 12:34.769
l've been shot at,
ripped off, forced down,

12:34.843 --> 12:36.902
and stuck in
the middle of a hurricane.

12:36.978 --> 12:40.004
Uh, let me have another drink,
will you? Him, too.

12:40.749 --> 12:43.684
See, back in 1960,
l was a member of a unit

12:44.186 --> 12:46.313
that was sent down
to Central America

12:46.388 --> 12:48.879
to train Cuban nationals
for the invasion.

12:48.957 --> 12:50.948
Oh, yeah, that set up
for the Bay of Pigs.

12:51.026 --> 12:52.550
You told me about that once.

12:52.627 --> 12:53.889
Yeah.

12:54.563 --> 12:59.000
String, those Cuban people
were the greatest.

13:00.936 --> 13:04.372
l mean, they weren't
mercenaries or killers.

13:04.806 --> 13:06.967
These were the best teachers,

13:07.042 --> 13:10.409
doctors, lawyers,
even priests.

13:13.882 --> 13:15.440
They were patriots.

13:15.650 --> 13:18.778
A bunch of anti-Castro
patriots got together,

13:18.854 --> 13:22.153
raised enough money
to buy a couple of old-timers

13:22.224 --> 13:24.089
from a corrupt colonel.

13:25.427 --> 13:27.156
You know that some of them

13:27.229 --> 13:29.493
have been down there
for over 20 years?

13:30.899 --> 13:35.427
String, l knew those men,
and l almost had them out.

13:37.138 --> 13:39.072
Almost is not good enough,

13:40.408 --> 13:41.670
Mr. Santini.

13:59.094 --> 14:01.289
You must tell me
where the money is.

14:01.363 --> 14:03.957
l told you.
We were ripped off.

14:04.032 --> 14:06.364
Don't you understand?
We were robbed.

14:06.434 --> 14:09.494
So that Col. Fernandez
wouldn't turn the men loose.

14:09.838 --> 14:12.432
l don't believe it.
You stole it.

14:12.607 --> 14:14.666
$2 million can take someone
a long way.

14:14.743 --> 14:16.870
Then why did l come back
at all?

14:17.178 --> 14:19.612
This money is the very soul
of this community.

14:19.681 --> 14:22.115
Widows and children
sent nickels and dimes

14:22.183 --> 14:23.673
to free those people.

14:23.919 --> 14:27.320
This house has more mortgages
then roof tiles.

14:28.223 --> 14:30.054
Dominic didn't
steal your money.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.888
One lies for the other.

14:33.628 --> 14:36.358
l suggest we lower our voices.

14:36.564 --> 14:39.727
Uh, volume is not going
to bring any truth into this.

14:39.801 --> 14:40.893
[sighing]

14:40.969 --> 14:42.630
Dom,
why don't you take a walk?

14:42.704 --> 14:44.695
Let me try and talk
to these people.

14:44.773 --> 14:45.967
Yeah, l'd better

14:46.041 --> 14:48.908
before l knock somebody
on her $2 million fanny.

14:51.179 --> 14:54.012
ln the old days, we didn't
argue amongst ourselves.

14:56.584 --> 14:57.812
Come on.

15:01.022 --> 15:03.388
Why'd you choose Dom
in the first place?

15:03.992 --> 15:06.222
These are the men
he was after.

15:07.896 --> 15:10.660
Father Gomez,
who spoke against Castro

15:10.732 --> 15:13.064
on the steps of the cathedral
in Havana.

15:13.168 --> 15:16.331
Ramon Collarzo,
publisher, writer,

15:17.172 --> 15:18.867
and my father.

15:20.542 --> 15:22.271
Dominic trained these men.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.403
When he called them friends,
he meant it.

15:24.479 --> 15:28.415
We chose Mr. Santini because
he could recognize them,

15:29.217 --> 15:31.947
regardless
of their physical condition.

15:32.787 --> 15:35.017
lf Mr. Santini
stole the money,

15:35.523 --> 15:38.151
he has condemned my son
to die in Cuba.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.260
Look, that collection
was no secret.

15:40.328 --> 15:41.989
The money was headed for Cuba.

15:42.063 --> 15:44.327
All a thief would have to know
is when and where.

15:44.399 --> 15:47.163
lmpossible.
Our people would never do it.

15:47.869 --> 15:50.565
Your people are so pure
there's none you worry about?

15:50.638 --> 15:51.866
Not even the Marielitos?

15:51.940 --> 15:53.100
They are not our people.

15:53.174 --> 15:54.436
They're Cubans.

15:54.509 --> 15:56.500
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:56.578 --> 15:58.603
The Marielitos are too busy

15:58.680 --> 16:01.979
fighting among themselves
to plan or organize.

16:05.787 --> 16:08.278
Sanchez is organized.

16:09.024 --> 16:10.924
What are you saying,
Grandfather?

16:10.992 --> 16:13.927
Something l should have
told you, but didn't.

16:14.529 --> 16:15.689
Come here.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.035
You must know the truth.

16:21.703 --> 16:25.195
We needed $2 million
to save these people.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.032
And we raised it.

16:28.376 --> 16:29.900
We raised $1 million.

16:29.978 --> 16:31.946
$1 million l borrowed
from Sanchez.

16:32.013 --> 16:33.173
What?

16:34.315 --> 16:36.180
How could you do this?

16:36.584 --> 16:38.677
Do you know what
you've made us?

16:45.994 --> 16:50.397
My granddaughter
burns with a bright flame.

16:51.499 --> 16:53.660
There's a generation of Cubans

16:53.735 --> 16:56.465
who have never known Cuba,
Mr. Hawke.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.705
For them,
it is the old country.

17:02.077 --> 17:06.241
But now, with our heroes back
from Castro's jails,

17:06.548 --> 17:10.848
our cause could grow
young again, and flourish.

17:11.752 --> 17:15.086
We could easily raise
and pay back $1 million.

17:15.924 --> 17:17.391
This was my plan.

17:19.493 --> 17:21.826
You know,
politics is a hard game.

17:22.130 --> 17:24.121
A game for old men...

17:27.535 --> 17:29.503
not bright flames.

17:45.019 --> 17:47.249
He has no idea what he's done.

17:47.555 --> 17:49.022
l think he does.

17:49.924 --> 17:52.188
l have a great deal of respect
for the man.

17:52.260 --> 17:55.627
But to deal with Sanchez,
a ruthless killer,

17:55.697 --> 17:58.131
drug smuggler,
God knows what else.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.831
There isn't a man
that works for him

18:00.902 --> 18:02.836
that doesn't have marks.

18:02.937 --> 18:04.029
Marks?

18:04.105 --> 18:07.563
Tattoos. lnside the lip,
near the thumb.

18:09.310 --> 18:11.744
lt's a code
from the Cuban prisons.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.211
Three dots is a robber,
four is a killer.

18:17.685 --> 18:19.016
And what is one dot?

18:19.087 --> 18:20.611
A political prisoner.

18:20.755 --> 18:24.122
l put it there in sympathy.
lt's what my father wears.

18:25.293 --> 18:26.419
[sighing]

18:26.561 --> 18:28.961
Where would one
find this Sanchez?

18:29.998 --> 18:32.592
He has a camp on an island
in the Keys.

18:32.667 --> 18:36.068
He has his own private army,
arms, and training.

18:36.538 --> 18:39.166
Things that we would love
to have, but can't afford.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.400
Helicopters?

18:40.475 --> 18:41.965
Yes, probably.

18:43.745 --> 18:46.976
But why would Sanchez
rob Mr. Santini?

18:48.616 --> 18:50.140
Half the money was his.

18:50.218 --> 18:51.480
Half wasn't.

18:52.287 --> 18:55.484
You'll do anything to save
your friend, won't you?

18:58.660 --> 18:59.854
l'm still not sure

18:59.928 --> 19:02.021
Santini didn't make up
this whole story.

19:02.096 --> 19:04.690
lf you knew him like l do,
you'd believe him.

19:04.832 --> 19:07.699
lt gets harder and harder
to believe in anything,

19:08.436 --> 19:12.099
except someday,
my father will be set free.

19:12.407 --> 19:14.272
You just have to keep trying.

19:18.379 --> 19:21.473
The only thing l can offer is
that l understand.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.581
l really do.

19:31.659 --> 19:33.149
[sighing]

19:41.703 --> 19:44.536
Stella told me the approximate
location of the camp,

19:44.606 --> 19:47.404
but l still think some pointed
questions are in order.

19:47.475 --> 19:49.568
You would go there unarmed?

19:50.545 --> 19:54.311
Well, not exactly.
And not alone, either.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.244
l need Mr. Santini.

19:57.318 --> 19:58.342
No.

19:58.686 --> 20:00.278
Stella, please.

20:01.456 --> 20:03.549
Mr. Santini
has been involved in my life

20:03.625 --> 20:05.616
for almost as long as you.

20:09.530 --> 20:11.521
l'm not convinced
he's a thief.

20:18.606 --> 20:20.574
(Hawke)
Do you see anything yet?

20:20.642 --> 20:23.975
Oh, yeah. Mansions,
swimming pools, Jacuzzis.

20:24.279 --> 20:26.372
No unpopulated islands yet.

20:26.914 --> 20:29.280
(Hawke)
I'm gonna cover
the east quadrant.

20:29.350 --> 20:32.217
Then I'll swing around
for a north-south scan.

20:32.287 --> 20:35.085
I'll sure miss the view
of expensive real estate.

20:43.264 --> 20:45.664
There's one ahead of us.
You see anything yet?

20:45.733 --> 20:48.258
Sand and coral.
No, hold it, String.

20:48.403 --> 20:51.099
[electronic whooshing]

20:53.708 --> 20:55.733
(Dominic)
We have a couple of blips.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.835
(Hawke)
You sure
it's not a heated pool?

20:57.912 --> 20:59.539
I'm sure because the lifeguard

20:59.614 --> 21:02.276
is carrying a .50 caliber
on his dune buggy.

21:02.350 --> 21:03.874
Let's go take a look.

21:07.588 --> 21:09.988
[speaking in Spanish]

21:15.496 --> 21:16.986
l am showing you the newest

21:17.065 --> 21:19.431
of hand-launched,
heat-seeking missiles,

21:19.500 --> 21:22.492
and you want to know
can it blow a bank vault?

21:24.138 --> 21:25.127
Estupido.

21:26.641 --> 21:28.666
[speaking in Spanish]

21:37.752 --> 21:39.720
[helicopter whirring]

21:40.121 --> 21:42.248
[men speaking in Spanish]

21:44.292 --> 21:47.557
[Hawke speaking Spanish]

21:52.934 --> 21:54.663
[men chattering]

21:57.805 --> 22:00.000
That's U.S. equipment
they're playing with.

22:00.074 --> 22:02.133
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

22:21.129 --> 22:22.687
[missiles firing]

22:27.935 --> 22:29.630
[shouting in Spanish]

23:36.971 --> 23:38.563
[men shouting]

24:10.838 --> 24:12.305
[speaking in Spanish]

24:20.948 --> 24:23.075
Didn't l say l came to talk?

24:23.651 --> 24:25.278
What do you want?

24:25.753 --> 24:28.551
lvan Rivera and l
would like some answers.

24:30.625 --> 24:32.684
From the looks
of your equipment,

24:32.760 --> 24:35.024
l can see
where $2 million would go.

24:36.197 --> 24:38.631
That's not how
l paid for these weapons.

24:38.733 --> 24:41.031
lt is,
till you prove different.

24:42.036 --> 24:44.061
Can l call that jeep here?

24:45.373 --> 24:48.206
Yeah, just tell him
to keep it in low gear.

24:48.442 --> 24:50.307
[speaking in Spanish]

24:59.120 --> 25:01.111
lf you don't know
how to use one,

25:01.188 --> 25:03.179
l'll be glad to show you.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.657
[sighing]

25:09.363 --> 25:11.024
[beeping]

25:12.033 --> 25:13.159
Archangel.

25:13.334 --> 25:14.426
Hawke?

25:15.503 --> 25:17.528
What are you doing
on this channel?

25:30.418 --> 25:33.046
We spend months
establishing Camp Freedom,

25:33.120 --> 25:35.816
and you and Airwolf
waste it in 10 minutes.

25:35.890 --> 25:37.653
[Hawke chuckling]
Camp Freedom.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.919
You really are amazing,
Michael.

25:39.994 --> 25:42.394
You give a bunch of criminals
sophisticated weaponry

25:42.463 --> 25:44.294
and you call it Camp Freedom?

25:44.365 --> 25:47.198
Hawke, you've got to
tune into the bigger picture.

25:47.602 --> 25:50.765
These men were being trained
to combat communist insurgents

25:50.838 --> 25:52.533
in Central American
trouble spots.

25:52.607 --> 25:54.632
Well, l guess l'm just not
sophisticated enough

25:54.709 --> 25:57.109
to judge the morality
of using a bunch of pirates

25:57.178 --> 25:59.373
to fight Uncle Sam's battles.

25:59.447 --> 26:02.075
l'm sure the newspapers
will give you a better shake.

26:02.149 --> 26:03.514
You're not serious?

26:03.918 --> 26:05.146
And the White House

26:05.219 --> 26:07.312
doesn't know anything
about this, l'll bet.

26:07.388 --> 26:08.980
They shouldn't hold a grudge
against the Firm

26:09.023 --> 26:11.821
for more than
a couple of budget years.

26:11.892 --> 26:14.087
You're talking about
blackmail.

26:14.161 --> 26:15.924
Not until l ask for something.

26:15.997 --> 26:17.624
What are you asking for?

26:17.698 --> 26:19.996
$3 million, cash.

26:20.067 --> 26:21.159
[scoffing]

26:21.235 --> 26:22.668
You're insane.

26:22.737 --> 26:25.729
Anybody got the number
of The Washington Post?

26:32.113 --> 26:33.239
[sighing]

26:33.414 --> 26:35.041
Okay, you got it.

26:38.653 --> 26:40.518
lt is still blackmail.

26:41.288 --> 26:44.257
But Marella, you're just not
seeing the bigger picture.

26:44.325 --> 26:45.622
[laughing]

26:47.428 --> 26:50.795
Red Star?
Red Star, this is Venus.

26:50.965 --> 26:52.227
Come in.

26:52.433 --> 26:53.764
Red Star?

26:54.268 --> 26:56.498
This is Venus.
Come in, please.

26:57.471 --> 26:59.996
Red Star, this is Venus.
Come in.

27:02.009 --> 27:03.499
They're not answering.

27:04.045 --> 27:05.512
Try it again.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.611
Red Star, this is Venus.
Come in.

27:12.787 --> 27:15.051
(Fernandez)
This is Red Star. Go ahead.

27:15.189 --> 27:18.124
Arrangements have been
completed on this end.

27:18.325 --> 27:20.850
We are waiting
for your instructions.

27:21.562 --> 27:24.690
We will be expecting shipment
at 1 200 hours.

27:27.735 --> 27:29.134
Message confirmed.

27:29.203 --> 27:30.693
This is your last chance.

27:32.873 --> 27:34.636
Confirmed. Out.

27:37.378 --> 27:38.675
[sighing]

27:39.046 --> 27:40.274
[laughing]

27:45.986 --> 27:47.214
What's that for?

27:47.288 --> 27:50.348
For making it possible
to bring my father home.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.820
He's not home, yet.

27:54.495 --> 27:56.861
l'll get Dom
and we'll make the transfer.

28:01.535 --> 28:03.628
You won't be
making the delivery.

28:04.805 --> 28:06.295
That's a joke, right?

28:06.373 --> 28:07.601
lt is no joke.

28:08.042 --> 28:11.500
We want to make sure that
nothing goes wrong this time.

28:11.846 --> 28:13.780
Meaning Dominic?
You can't do that.

28:13.848 --> 28:16.043
You have no right
to take the moment from him.

28:16.117 --> 28:17.880
We have every right.

28:18.786 --> 28:21.755
We want this to be
an all-Cuban operation.

28:22.823 --> 28:24.552
This has nothing to do
with you.

28:24.625 --> 28:25.990
Yes, it does.

28:26.494 --> 28:28.359
We can't take the chance.

28:28.529 --> 28:31.020
What are you gonna trade
for your father, an lOU?

28:31.098 --> 28:32.963
You'd withhold the money?

28:33.033 --> 28:36.799
No, l simply trade for trust.

28:55.322 --> 28:57.085
My apologies, Mr. Hawke,

28:57.158 --> 28:59.388
but the committee's decision
is final.

28:59.727 --> 29:01.354
We hired a pilot.

29:01.996 --> 29:05.124
Now, if you will just
deliver the money.

29:05.466 --> 29:06.831
l don't think so.

29:08.536 --> 29:10.629
You are forcing our hand.

29:13.607 --> 29:15.370
To do what? Shoot me?

29:16.977 --> 29:18.171
lf that's the case,

29:18.245 --> 29:20.941
you'd better add three dots
to your lower lip

29:21.015 --> 29:22.778
and go to work for Sanchez.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.347
lf l've got to
gamble on people,

29:26.420 --> 29:28.547
l'd just as soon it was you.

29:30.724 --> 29:32.817
You're not killing anybody.

29:36.397 --> 29:37.864
You win, Mr. Hawke.

29:37.932 --> 29:40.765
No, you win, Mr. Rivera.

29:43.170 --> 29:45.730
Would you at least
take one of us along

29:46.140 --> 29:48.005
to satisfy our people?

29:49.677 --> 29:51.201
[exhaling]

29:55.149 --> 29:56.810
[men chattering]

29:58.819 --> 29:59.979
[choking]

30:00.154 --> 30:01.314
[exclaiming]

30:01.755 --> 30:03.518
Best bottle of wine
in the house.

30:03.591 --> 30:06.253
You'd think with $3 million
on the seat between us,

30:06.327 --> 30:08.693
a vintage Bordeaux
would be more appropriate.

30:08.896 --> 30:10.921
With $3 million
on the seat between us,

30:10.998 --> 30:13.694
not advertising it
would be appropriate.

30:14.101 --> 30:16.399
Well, they don't look
too dangerous to me.

30:16.470 --> 30:18.961
Only to some species
of marine life.

30:19.139 --> 30:21.437
l suppose it would be
pointless of me to ask

30:21.508 --> 30:24.909
to what end this exorbitant
outlay of cash is intended.

30:24.979 --> 30:26.640
That's right. Pointless.

30:26.714 --> 30:27.942
l figured.

30:28.015 --> 30:29.607
All set, String.

30:31.385 --> 30:34.377
Ah! All we need now
is the money.

30:35.322 --> 30:37.051
Here, let me help you.

30:38.959 --> 30:41.655
This is one kind of baggage
l enjoy handling.

30:42.529 --> 30:44.963
Stringfellow,
who are these people?

30:45.099 --> 30:46.794
Why are they being
so generous?

30:46.867 --> 30:48.129
Good question.

30:48.202 --> 30:50.727
They, uh, represent a firm
that makes covers

30:50.804 --> 30:52.738
to keep things under wraps.

30:52.973 --> 30:54.964
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

30:55.042 --> 30:57.033
Uh, we'll be back
in about three hours.

30:57.111 --> 30:59.875
l think you'll enjoy
what your money brings back.

31:00.281 --> 31:01.441
[chuckling]

31:01.548 --> 31:03.106
You ready? Come on.

31:04.351 --> 31:06.319
Listen, you take it easy.

31:06.387 --> 31:07.376
Hey.

31:07.621 --> 31:09.680
No kick the tires,
lighting fires stuff.

31:09.757 --> 31:10.746
Milk run.

31:10.824 --> 31:11.950
Okay.

31:18.966 --> 31:22.163
He's on his way back across
the straits to Cuba, isn't he?

31:22.236 --> 31:24.101
You know, l think the next
bottle of wine we buy

31:24.138 --> 31:27.130
better be a cheap one.
l'm broke.

31:30.978 --> 31:32.343
[sighing]

31:33.414 --> 31:36.713
(Dominic)
We're on our way back.
You still think I'm a thief?

31:37.751 --> 31:39.912
We've got about
100 miles to go,

31:39.987 --> 31:42.717
and l'm watching the compass
all the way.

31:48.529 --> 31:50.019
How much longer?

31:50.431 --> 31:54.367
Michael, they just took off.
Give them a little time.

31:54.501 --> 31:56.093
lt's been 30 minutes.

31:56.170 --> 31:59.264
You could've been to Havana
and back in Airwolf.

31:59.406 --> 32:01.931
Santini's not flying Airwolf,
is he?

32:02.009 --> 32:03.909
Of course not, Michael.

32:06.413 --> 32:07.573
Thanks.

32:08.682 --> 32:11.014
Listen, will you excuse
me just a moment?

32:30.904 --> 32:33.372
[dog barking]

32:34.141 --> 32:35.540
[car engine starting]

32:46.420 --> 32:48.081
[tires screeching]

33:41.809 --> 33:43.902
Should we try and find him?

33:45.245 --> 33:46.337
No.

33:50.484 --> 33:52.975
lf he wants to play this
without our help,

33:53.053 --> 33:54.782
we'll just let him.

34:01.361 --> 34:02.692
[exhaling]

34:04.498 --> 34:06.625
Why don't you say something?

34:07.101 --> 34:08.568
What's the matter with you?

34:08.635 --> 34:10.933
There is nothing
the matter with them.

34:11.371 --> 34:14.101
They are loyal to me,
and l do the talking.

34:14.808 --> 34:16.435
l hope we'll be able to talk

34:16.510 --> 34:18.478
as one military man
to another.

34:18.545 --> 34:20.536
We do work for the same firm,
after all.

34:20.614 --> 34:21.945
l work for myself.

34:22.014 --> 34:24.483
And you built that combat
helicopter all by yourself

34:24.551 --> 34:26.485
out of, uh, old tractor parts?

34:28.155 --> 34:30.589
l would like such a tractor
myself.

34:30.824 --> 34:32.518
Sorry, l'm fresh out.

34:32.793 --> 34:35.353
Then will you lend me
the one you drive?

34:35.429 --> 34:36.953
Just for a few years?

34:37.030 --> 34:38.121
Long enough for you to

34:38.165 --> 34:41.190
overthrow the small country
of your choice, huh?

34:41.368 --> 34:42.891
We think alike.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.434
No chance.

34:44.838 --> 34:46.829
Your friend
and, uh, the Rivera girl

34:46.907 --> 34:49.170
will soon be entering
Cuban air space.

34:50.110 --> 34:52.135
l could let my colleague
in Cuba

34:52.212 --> 34:54.043
go through
with his original plan,

34:54.114 --> 34:55.945
and you will never
see them again.

34:56.016 --> 34:59.076
Or, they can come home
with the prisoners.

34:59.620 --> 35:02.088
What hold have you got
over that Cuban colonel?

35:02.156 --> 35:03.555
He needs me.

35:03.624 --> 35:05.592
What he is doing
is against Cuban law.

35:05.692 --> 35:07.853
He needs my support,
my helicopters.

35:08.495 --> 35:11.089
[scoffing]
And to think at one time
he was my jailer.

35:11.198 --> 35:13.462
Now we both work
on the same side,

35:13.534 --> 35:14.967
as you and l will.

35:15.035 --> 35:16.559
l'm afraid not.

35:18.305 --> 35:21.672
Then your friend will spend
20 years in a Cuban prison,

35:21.742 --> 35:24.575
and l assure you,
it will be hell on earth.

35:33.987 --> 35:36.683
(Dominic)
We'll be in Cuba
in 10 minutes.

35:38.492 --> 35:40.153
l hope you're convinced now

35:40.227 --> 35:42.718
that l didn't steal
your $2 million.

35:42.996 --> 35:44.327
l guess so.

35:45.365 --> 35:47.595
Did you really know my father?

35:47.968 --> 35:50.937
l did, and a braver man
l never knew.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.065
l have met some daughters
just as brave, though.

35:56.143 --> 35:58.737
[man on radio
speaking Spanish]

36:06.720 --> 36:09.120
[speaking in Spanish]

36:10.591 --> 36:12.855
[speaking in Spanish]

36:30.744 --> 36:32.041
[speaking in Spanish]

36:43.890 --> 36:46.791
Now open the hatch
if you please, Mr. Hawke.

36:49.463 --> 36:51.454
We are waiting, Mr. Hawke.

36:51.632 --> 36:53.395
The cabin's pressurized.

36:53.734 --> 36:55.725
You have to back up a little.

37:06.413 --> 37:08.404
[men shouting in Spanish]

37:25.899 --> 37:27.526
Yeah, yeah, okay, Colonel,

37:27.601 --> 37:29.296
we've been through this
before.

37:29.369 --> 37:30.802
Now show us the men.

37:31.438 --> 37:33.065
[speaking in Spanish]

37:34.141 --> 37:35.574
[speaking in Spanish]

38:24.124 --> 38:26.388
So good to see you again,
senor Santini.

38:26.460 --> 38:28.485
Likewise, l'm sure.

38:29.496 --> 38:31.464
There. Go ahead, count it.

38:32.132 --> 38:33.064
l see you have brought

38:33.100 --> 38:36.001
a beautiful senorita with you
this time.

38:36.069 --> 38:38.264
l'm sorry
l cannot do the same.

38:38.338 --> 38:39.669
All l have are...

38:39.740 --> 38:41.469
[speaking in Spanish]

38:49.082 --> 38:51.642
You're a slimy,
lying piece of garbage!

38:51.718 --> 38:53.117
[laughing]

38:59.092 --> 39:00.457
[exclaiming]

39:03.697 --> 39:05.062
[men shouting]

39:06.933 --> 39:09.026
[shouting in Spanish]

40:58.078 --> 40:59.340
Let's go home.

41:16.630 --> 41:18.222
[speaking in Spanish]

41:28.475 --> 41:29.806
Ataque.

41:50.063 --> 41:52.190
(Hawke)
Come on,
move that donkey cart.

41:52.265 --> 41:53.994
Going to be a long 90 miles.

41:54.067 --> 41:57.059
You just cool your tail rotor
there, hotshot.

41:57.304 --> 41:59.534
Besides,
without me and that ship

41:59.606 --> 42:01.096
to keep you out of trouble,

42:01.174 --> 42:03.165
it's you I'm worried about.

42:04.544 --> 42:06.375
(Dominic)
I take it back, String.

42:06.446 --> 42:08.471
It's me I'm worried about.

42:09.282 --> 42:11.011
[speaking in Spanish]

42:12.619 --> 42:14.610
(Hawke)
He popped a Sidewinder.

42:14.688 --> 42:16.588
Radar guidance or infrared?

42:16.690 --> 42:19.250
I don't know.
I can't see it from here.

42:37.577 --> 42:39.010
[explosion]

43:18.184 --> 43:19.583
[speaking in Spanish]

43:31.398 --> 43:34.424
(Dominic)
String, get this thing
off my tail, will you?

43:41.241 --> 43:43.573
(Hawke)
Hang on, Dom.
I'll be your decoy.

44:13.740 --> 44:16.538
[laughing]
Not bad, String.

44:16.843 --> 44:18.811
You wrote your own
flight manual, there.

44:19.145 --> 44:20.510
[laughing]

44:32.459 --> 44:34.017
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:34.094 --> 44:36.722
the captain has put on
the ''no smoking'' sign.

44:36.963 --> 44:40.763
Please fasten your seat belts
as we prepare for our landing

44:41.034 --> 44:44.367
in los Estados Unidos,
in Norteamerica.

44:44.437 --> 44:45.734
[laughing]

44:45.805 --> 44:48.296
[speaking in Spanish]

45:14.868 --> 45:16.529
No, not at all, Mr. Rivera.

45:16.603 --> 45:19.299
We at the Firm have always
considered your organization

45:19.372 --> 45:22.341
to be a vital link
in our Latin American effort.

45:22.408 --> 45:25.138
Then why did you arm Sanchez
and not us?

45:25.211 --> 45:26.542
[stuttering]

45:27.547 --> 45:30.243
Of course,
now that our heroes are home,

45:30.316 --> 45:31.840
things have changed.

45:31.918 --> 45:34.216
Absolutely, and we would
like to work with you

45:34.287 --> 45:35.754
a lot more closely.

45:35.822 --> 45:38.416
Perhaps.
Let us examine your proposal.

45:38.491 --> 45:40.220
[laughing]

45:42.529 --> 45:45.225
Say, String,
did l ever thank you

45:45.298 --> 45:47.596
for bucking that hurricane
to find me?

45:47.667 --> 45:48.691
Nope.

45:48.768 --> 45:50.292
Did l ever thank you

45:50.370 --> 45:51.962
for bailing me out
with the Riveras,

45:52.038 --> 45:53.699
not to mention the MiG?

45:53.773 --> 45:55.070
No.

45:55.441 --> 45:58.604
Well, hell, then l owe you
about three more drinks.

45:58.678 --> 46:00.805
Larry, three more rounds.

46:01.314 --> 46:02.747
Attaboy.

46:02.949 --> 46:06.510
Well, these beers are going to
end up costing us $30 each.

46:07.654 --> 46:09.315
Easy come, easy go.

46:09.389 --> 46:10.481
[laughing]

46:43.957 --> 46:45.288

47:30.303 --> 47:31.634
