01:26.400 --> 01:32.158
<i>This story begins in a secret place</i>
<i>hidden deep in a forest.</i>

01:37.120 --> 01:38.873
<i>That is a Smurf.</i>

01:38.960 --> 01:40.758
<i>We call him Clumsy.</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:43.876
<i>And this is our village,</i>

01:43.960 --> 01:47.397
<i>where there's a Smurf</i>
<i>for just about everything.</i>

01:47.480 --> 01:48.914
<i>Like Jokey.</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:50.514
Hey, here's a present for you.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.958
Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.952
Actually, I meant to give you this one.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.190
Thanks!

02:00.240 --> 02:03.870
- 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
- <i>Here's Hefty.</i>

02:05.240 --> 02:06.356
<i>And over here is...</i>

02:06.440 --> 02:07.954
Now, for the one-fingered pushup.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.633
One, two, three...

02:09.720 --> 02:11.473
<i>Meet Nerdy Smurf.</i>

02:11.560 --> 02:14.519
- Excuse me?
- <i>Sorry, Brainy. Just kidding.</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:15.875
<i>Nosey.</i>

02:15.960 --> 02:18.429
Well, what's going on over there?

02:19.720 --> 02:21.074
<i>Paranoid Smurf.</i>

02:21.200 --> 02:22.520
<i>Winner.</i>

02:23.520 --> 02:24.556
<i>Loser.</i>

02:24.640 --> 02:25.869
<i>Karate Smurf.</i>

02:27.440 --> 02:30.000
<i>Handy. Vanity. Farmer. Painter. Baker.</i>

02:30.080 --> 02:32.311
<i>Magician. Scuba. Policeman. Therapist.</i>

02:32.400 --> 02:33.800
Sometimes I just feel blue.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.877
<i>There's even Table-Eating Smurf.</i>

02:35.960 --> 02:37.030
Hi.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.999
<i>Yeah, we're not too sure about him, either.</i>

02:40.080 --> 02:42.515
<i>And then there's me, Papa Smurf.</i>

02:42.640 --> 02:44.359
<i>I sort of run this place.</i>

02:44.440 --> 02:46.750
<i>But this isn't a story about me.</i>

02:48.760 --> 02:49.910
<i>Or Clumsy.</i>

02:50.000 --> 02:52.151
<i>Or any of them.</i>

02:52.240 --> 02:55.074
<i>It's about the only girl in our village.</i>

02:55.920 --> 02:57.479
<i>Smurfette.</i>

02:57.560 --> 02:58.755
Hi, Laundry Smurf.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.718
- Howdy-do, Smurfette.
- Hey, guys.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.157
<i>But that's not the only thing</i>
<i>that's different about Smurfette.</i>

03:05.040 --> 03:09.990
<i>She was created by the evil wizard, Gargamel.</i>

03:10.080 --> 03:11.639
<i>Using dark magic,</i>

03:13.480 --> 03:15.597
<i>he made her from a lump of clay.</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:20.038
Now, go and find Smurf Village.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.752
<i>Luckily, I knew a little magic of my own.</i>

03:34.120 --> 03:36.032
<i>But there was still one problem.</i>

03:36.120 --> 03:39.352
<i>Smurfette's name doesn't</i>
<i>tell us anything about her.</i>

03:39.440 --> 03:40.715
Okay, the physics are...

03:42.240 --> 03:43.560
<i>It doesn't tell us who she is.</i>

03:44.360 --> 03:46.317
- High heels.
- <i>Or what she does.</i>

03:46.960 --> 03:51.000
<i>So, what exactly is a Smurfette?</i>

03:51.640 --> 03:54.917
Well, let me be frank. She's a rubbish baker.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.912
Let's see. Smurfette.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.071
Smurfette, Smurfette, Smurfette.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.594
It's not here.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.356
Well, Smurfette is a combination
of a Smurf and an Ette.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.033
But what's an Ette?

04:08.760 --> 04:12.151
Yeah. Smurfette, well, she's...

04:12.240 --> 04:13.833
She's the greatest.

04:16.079 --> 04:20.313
The most wondrous creature on Earth.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.357
Yes, you are.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.920
Smurfette...

04:27.080 --> 04:28.196
I got it.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.593
This is one of those eternal questions
that we'll never, ever know the answer to.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.159
Wait, she is?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.515
Do you think she heard me?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.798
<i>So, what is a Smurfette?</i>

04:41.880 --> 04:46.159
<i>No one wanted that answer</i>
<i>more than Smurfette herself.</i>

04:58.280 --> 04:59.680
What are you doing?

05:00.920 --> 05:02.559
Hey, Grouchy, I was just...

05:02.640 --> 05:03.710
Leaving?

05:05.360 --> 05:06.953
This is my bench.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.475
I come here same time every day, and I...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.791
Let me guess. "And grouch."

05:11.880 --> 05:13.314
Exactly.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.315
I can do that. I can grouch.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.594
Hi, Grouchy. Hi, Smurfette. Nice day, huh?

05:20.680 --> 05:21.875
No, it's not.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.872
It's gonna rain!

05:26.560 --> 05:28.677
Which actually helps the plants grow.

05:28.760 --> 05:34.631
But also means it's gonna be cloudy,
so, chew on that.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.837
Then again, there might be a rainbow.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.037
But rainbows are dumb.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.079
Just kidding. I love rainbows.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.712
You're not very good at this, are ya?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.230
No, I'm not.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.915
In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.876
Yup.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.353
But you're also bad at it.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.760
That's a lie.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.672
You're really, really good at it.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.669
Hi, Brainy.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.553
Smurfette. Thank goodness you're here.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.960
I was...

06:09.880 --> 06:11.872
We're running trials on my new invention.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.475
The Smurfy Thing Finder.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.557
Test subject, Hefty Smurf.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.040
Hey, Smurfette!

06:18.120 --> 06:19.713
I mean...

06:19.800 --> 06:22.634
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Hey.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.994
That thing's safe, right?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.879
Is it safe? Of course.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.679
I'd get back here if I were you.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.990
Snappy Bug.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.190
Take this down.
Smurfy Thing Finder trial 1.03.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.556
- Ready, Hefty?
- Roger that.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.676
It works!

06:53.200 --> 06:54.919
This thing really gets me.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.071
It's able to hone in
on Hefty's dominant trait.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.560
Super strength.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.075
Which I distill into this.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.198
I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.078
Here, you can try it first.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.272
All clear!

07:09.360 --> 07:13.274
Yeah, you see, when you say things
like "all clear," it makes me not want to...

07:13.360 --> 07:14.510
Hey, guys.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.390
Hi, Clumsy.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.440
You're just in time
to witness scientific history.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.795
What's going on in here?

07:25.920 --> 07:28.196
None of your business, Nosey.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.032
Well, all right.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.960
Hey! If that vegetable hat
can tell us that Hefty is strong,

07:36.040 --> 07:38.760
maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.035
Power it up, Brainy.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.749
Fascinating.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.718
What happened?

08:14.800 --> 08:18.396
Somehow, instead of sending energy out,
you absorbed it.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.598
Probably something to do
with the fact that you're not a real...

08:22.320 --> 08:25.950
A real Smurf? Go ahead, you can say it.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.759
No, no, I just meant that

08:27.840 --> 08:33.154
this machine wasn't built
for a Smurf of your, well, origins.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.749
Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.996
Brainy.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.352
Hey, you know what?
Let's all go have some fun.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.794
Yeah!

08:43.880 --> 08:45.837
- Pizza!
- Smurfboarding!

08:45.960 --> 08:47.189
Smurfboarding!

08:53.120 --> 08:55.954
It's almost ready, Azrael.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.956
A pinch of newt poo.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.193
A gram of calcified fungus
from between the toes of a yak.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.239
And a piece of cheese
I left in my underpants last week.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.150
That ought to do it.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.236
Presto!

09:18.320 --> 09:21.870
Twelve spherical petrification modules.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.317
Or, as I like to call 'em, freeze balls.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.956
You're welcome, Azrael. Dinner is served.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.399
Ingrate.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.871
Besides, these freeze balls
aren't for catching mice.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.954
They're for capturing those elusive Smurfs.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.360
My holy grail.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.909
The gold at the end of my rainbow.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.596
The most potent magical ingredient
in the world.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.909
Next slide.

09:51.440 --> 09:55.150
Imagine the power in 100 of them combined.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.279
How I've searched high and low,
under every rock, it seems,

10:01.360 --> 10:03.113
with no sign of them anywhere.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.272
Not now, Azrael.
I'm in the middle of a lecture.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.873
My plan is simple.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.119
Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs,
drain them of their magic

10:13.200 --> 10:18.832
and, finally, use that magic to become
the most powerful wizard in the world!

10:22.120 --> 10:23.600
Look at me with hair.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.629
What?

10:25.720 --> 10:28.189
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

10:28.880 --> 10:32.556
Blue blazes!
I've spotted Smurfs in the forest!

10:34.040 --> 10:36.077
Well, it's my telescope. Monty!

10:37.800 --> 10:39.996
Come, my majestic eagle.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.279
Your talons are digging into my shoulders.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.230
That's better.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.312
Now, fly.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.154
Go capture me some Smurfs.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.799
No, no!

10:58.880 --> 11:01.395
No, you're going the wrong way!

11:18.440 --> 11:19.510
Yeah!

11:27.680 --> 11:28.750
Oh, no.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.114
My turn!

11:32.200 --> 11:33.839
Safety third.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.235
Oh, boy.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.310
Yeah!

11:54.320 --> 11:56.516
Really takes your breath away, doesn't she?

11:57.280 --> 11:59.317
This is incredible!

12:02.240 --> 12:06.393
Oh, no! She's getting way too close
to the Forbidden Forest.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.392
She can't go over that wall. Come on.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.592
No, no, no, wait. Don't go.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.679
Wait. Wait, who are you? Don't be afraid.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.234
Hey, you can't go in there.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.639
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

12:39.720 --> 12:42.110
- Smurfette, you okay?
- What happened? What happened?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.079
I saw a Smurf.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.395
- What?
- Who was it?

12:46.480 --> 12:49.154
I don't know, but he was wearing this.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.712
Smurfette! Code blue!

12:52.800 --> 12:53.836
Guys, come on.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.639
We've gotta get her.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.951
I have a bad feeling about this.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.190
Do you?

13:02.280 --> 13:06.354
Does it have to do with the giant vulture
carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.630
Monty, my regal raptor.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.598
You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.830
Give me a kiss.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.474
Finally, you bring me
what I've been asking for.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.155
A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless... You!

13:29.240 --> 13:33.120
Let me out of here,
you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.797
Is that any way to talk to the man
who brought you into this world?

13:37.880 --> 13:42.079
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."

13:43.880 --> 13:46.634
- I would never call you that.
- Your loss.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.551
What's this? What are you hiding?

13:51.240 --> 13:54.836
Hand it over, you pseudo-Smurf.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.594
Thank you, Azrael.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.110
What do we have here?

14:04.600 --> 14:08.310
A different design?
Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.073
Slightly before you did, in fact.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.398
- Where did you get it?
- I'm not telling you anything.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.392
- Tell me.
- No.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.675
- Tell me!
- No!

14:17.760 --> 14:19.160
- You better tell me.
- No!

14:19.240 --> 14:22.199
- Fine. Don't tell me.
- I won't.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.594
Stupid reverse psychology never works.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.752
Who cares?
You've already given me what I need.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.513
Come along, Azrael.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.431
Where on earth did I put those ingredients?

14:39.960 --> 14:44.716
I know this. Go left, then right,
back handspring, stick the landing.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.712
Is it a person, book or movie?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.634
No one ever understands
your hand signals, Hefty.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.314
Never mind. Just follow me and stay close.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.114
Wort of worm and hair of cat.

15:03.800 --> 15:09.319
Show me the home of this Smurf hat.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.676
<i>Long have you searched</i>
<i>for these creatures of blue.</i>

15:22.760 --> 15:25.912
<i>But this hat comes from somewhere new.</i>

15:26.000 --> 15:28.071
Yes. Where? Where does it come from?

15:28.160 --> 15:32.279
<i>A village of Smurfs, where enchantment grows.</i>

15:32.360 --> 15:35.592
An entire village. Good. Go on. Go on.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.194
<i>The location of which...</i>

15:37.280 --> 15:39.670
- Yes?
- <i>...nobody knows.</i>

15:39.760 --> 15:44.232
No! Just start with that.
Start with "I don't know."

15:44.320 --> 15:45.800
Lousy cheap-o cauldron.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.472
<i>But here is a clue.</i>

15:51.640 --> 15:55.429
Fascinating. But what is it?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.549
Trees?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.989
Must be a symbol for something, or a code.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.790
Trees, trees, breeze, knees.
Babies crawl on their knees.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.553
Check all the nurseries in the area!

16:10.360 --> 16:12.397
We're going to need to
disguise ourselves as babies.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.314
Now, where can I get a giant diaper?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.359
Azrael, it's not your map.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.911
You want your own map,
we'll get you your own map, but this is my...

16:22.040 --> 16:24.794
Wait a minute. Look what I found.

16:24.920 --> 16:30.314
Three tall trees, in the Forbidden Forest.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.118
We've never searched there before.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.799
I'm a genius.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.199
Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.198
Prepare my trail mix.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.115
Smurfette, congratulations.

16:47.200 --> 16:52.594
You've just led me
to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.750
They have no idea we even exist.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.991
I'll be like...

16:58.080 --> 16:59.799
They'll be all like, "Oh, no!"

16:59.880 --> 17:01.360
And I'll be like...

17:01.440 --> 17:04.512
And they'll be like...
"Run! No! Run, run, run!"

17:05.280 --> 17:08.159
You evil little genius.

17:08.240 --> 17:12.119
The rotten apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree after all.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.680
Does it?

17:15.480 --> 17:19.520
Get your fur and feathers in gear, boys.
We leave at first light.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.077
Right after breakfast, say 8:00, 8:30.
9:00 at the latest.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.959
- Wait, Brainy, the map.
- I'm on it.

17:27.599 --> 17:31.116
Fine, maybe 9:30.
Absolutely no later than 10:00, though.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.351
- What the... It's a jailbreak!
- Go, go, go!

17:33.440 --> 17:36.319
They know my plans. They'll ruin everything!

17:36.840 --> 17:38.320
Is this safe?

17:38.400 --> 17:41.837
Well, it's a giant crossbow,
so I'm gonna go with "no."

17:41.920 --> 17:43.639
Don't let them escape.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.232
- Where are the seat belts?
- Get them! Get those Smurfs!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.639
Fire in the hole!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.153
Get those Smurfs!

18:05.560 --> 18:07.040
Azrael's gaining on us.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.793
Incoming bird!

18:17.640 --> 18:20.235
- This might hurt.
- No!

18:34.360 --> 18:36.272
Come on. Smurf this way.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.240
Run faster! Run faster!

19:05.320 --> 19:07.471
Why are our legs so short?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.631
Why are our feet so big?

19:09.720 --> 19:13.157
- Why are my muscles so big?
- Really, man?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.640
Guys! Guys! A little help here.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.309
It's coming.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.830
- Yes!
- All right!

19:41.960 --> 19:46.512
Well, I know four Smurfs
who have some explaining to do.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.432
- Oh, boy.
- Hi.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.433
- Oh, my gosh. Papa, you will not believe it.
- We ran into the Forbidden Forest.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.273
One at a time. One at a time.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.955
Please. Please.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.919
- Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.
- We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.749
I've told you time and again,
the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.

20:03.840 --> 20:08.039
And now you're talking about maps
and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.713
None of this makes any sense,

20:09.800 --> 20:12.872
and I really don't understand
why you can't follow simple rules.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.270
You snuck out and it put you all in danger.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.040
Seems to me the only way
I can keep you safe is if...

20:19.040 --> 20:20.554
You're grounded.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.756
- Grounded? No, not grounded!
- What? No way!

20:21.840 --> 20:23.399
- But, Papa, but...
- Come on!

20:23.480 --> 20:24.550
No "buts."

20:24.640 --> 20:26.359
None of you are to take one step
out of your mushrooms

20:26.440 --> 20:28.318
without telling me where you're going.
Do you understand that?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.278
- You're right, Papa.
- What?

20:30.360 --> 20:33.398
You're right.
I don't know what we were thinking.

20:34.760 --> 20:40.074
Good. Because, as I was saying,
you behaved completely irresponsibly.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.551
Yes. Right. Exactly.
I couldn't agree more. Right, guys?

20:43.640 --> 20:45.154
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.799
- What are you talking about, Smurfette?
- Okay.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.951
Yes, so... And furthermore...

20:49.040 --> 20:51.635
In fact, I think we should all
go to our rooms right now

20:51.720 --> 20:53.074
and think about what we've done.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.197
- Well, I think that's...
- Tough, but fair.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.430
- Come on, guys.
- Okay, okay.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.715
- Okay, I'm moving.
- What's your endgame here?

20:57.800 --> 20:59.075
Did you get pecked on the noggin, Smurfette?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.072
- Actually, Smurfette...
- Don't worry, Papa.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.039
We are certainly going to do
some thinking about what we did.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.270
And so forth.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.431
But we will definitely not be
leaving our rooms

21:07.520 --> 21:09.273
until we've thought this whole thing out.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.114
And then, just for good measure,
we'll think about it some more.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.634
Yes, but...

21:13.720 --> 21:14.915
Great talk, Papa.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.400
I have no idea what I'm doing.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.952
Hefty, I know that's you.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.315
'Sup, Smurfette?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.595
Brainy.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.955
How did you do that?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.872
And, I assume, Clumsy.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.877
- All good.
- What are you guys doing out here?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.872
We knew you were up to something.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.872
This is all my fault, Hefty.

23:04.960 --> 23:09.034
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?
It's too dangerous.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.874
I have to at least warn that lost village.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.873
Well, we're Team Smurf,
and we stick together.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.077
So, we're coming with you.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.560
I can't ask you to do that.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.200
- You didn't ask.
- We volunteered.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.240
- Thanks, guys.
- First things first.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.396
Bug technology. Cool.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.437
According to my map, we should be standing

23:38.560 --> 23:41.951
right in front of this
very large, tall stone wall.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.320
Check.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.356
One small step for four small Smurfs...

24:09.440 --> 24:11.591
Okay. Let us proceed.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.480
- Smurfette!
- You okay, Smurfette?

24:45.640 --> 24:49.475
Nice flowers. Nice flowers.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.711
Not nice flowers!

25:28.960 --> 25:29.996
Where's Clumsy?

25:35.760 --> 25:38.912
Hey! We just met! I'm not that kind of Smurf.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.114
Watch out for the steep embankment.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.517
Clumsy, you okay?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.390
I'm seeing stars.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.873
Good work, Clumsy.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.998
You may have discovered
a new subspecies of flying insectoid.

26:46.560 --> 26:50.270
Amazing! A winged, fire-breathing Anisoptera.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.000
Let's see. How should we classify this?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.558
Maybe. I mean, seems like an easy choice,
but I'm just not sure.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.639
Yea, okay, let's go with "dragonfly."
Hopefully more "fly" than "dragon."

27:04.440 --> 27:06.909
Nope! Less "fly!" Less "fly!"

27:09.320 --> 27:10.356
Guys!

27:16.960 --> 27:18.110
I'm okay.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.439
A little help here.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.757
Monty, get off of me.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.914
I hate nature.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.480
How gaudy.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.760
Azrael, do something!

27:59.760 --> 28:01.319
It's quite painful.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.518
Stop laughing. This is not funny.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.436
Watch it!

28:11.760 --> 28:13.956
Let me go!

28:21.640 --> 28:24.599
These nests are made of some material
I've never seen before.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.990
You know, I think I've had enough
of these flying Antipastos for one day.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.076
Hey! What are you doing here?

28:42.160 --> 28:44.436
Well, I was thinking of getting
a little place out here.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.637
Just a quiet place in the forest.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.077
It's a little breezy up on the hill.
What do you think I'm doing out here?

28:50.160 --> 28:53.392
You are never going to find
that village, Gargamel.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.393
Smurfette, if it wasn't for you,

28:56.480 --> 28:58.631
I wouldn't even know
about those other Smurfs.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.478
- Get 'em, boys.
- Smurfintine formation! Go!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.396
- Hey!
- Smurfintine!

29:05.480 --> 29:07.073
- Get 'em, Azrael!
- Smurfintine!

29:07.160 --> 29:09.072
- Smurfintine!
- Smurfintine!

29:15.840 --> 29:16.990
Smurfintine!

29:17.080 --> 29:19.436
Hey, you. You're the clumsy one, right?

29:19.520 --> 29:20.590
Think fast.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.909
I caught it!

29:26.560 --> 29:27.755
This isn't good.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.829
- Clumsy, give 'em back their egg!
- Okay.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.994
Oh, come on!

29:36.080 --> 29:38.390
- Clumsy!
- I'm trying!

29:48.360 --> 29:50.920
I'm really, really sorry, guys!

29:51.760 --> 29:52.876
Over there!

30:00.960 --> 30:02.952
I didn't mean to poach your egg.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.351
Well, they're toast.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.954
It doesn't matter.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.713
What's a few worthless pennies

30:12.800 --> 30:16.271
when there's a pot of gold
at the end of my rainbow?

30:17.760 --> 30:20.036
Trust me, they're goners.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.272
I'm telling you,
they've been fried to a blue crisp.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.874
They're Smurf kabobs.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.189
Smurfberry flambe.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.839
Marshmallows.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.832
Can it, fuzzball. They're dead.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.718
Dead, I say!

30:47.280 --> 30:48.555
Hello?

30:50.280 --> 30:51.839
Smurfette?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.158
Echo!

31:04.600 --> 31:10.358
Darkness. I don't do well in the darkness.
I have enough trouble in the daylight.

31:10.440 --> 31:14.070
Hold on, everyone.
We need to find a way out of here.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.279
That is good thinking, "Brainy."

31:18.360 --> 31:20.192
- Guys?
- Darkness!

31:20.280 --> 31:24.911
Don't be scared. Just...
Just think happy thoughts.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.560
It's not really happy times right now!

31:27.640 --> 31:30.758
- Just stay in the light, Clumsy.
- Too late.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.433
I'm walking into the darkness!

31:32.520 --> 31:34.113
What are you... Why?

31:34.200 --> 31:37.352
I'm really freaking out, you guys!

31:37.440 --> 31:39.397
Stop, everyone.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.997
Okay, go into your backpacks,
get out your emergency tunnel survival kit,

31:44.080 --> 31:49.030
find the small glass vial marked "light,"
and shake it really hard.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.797
Clumsy? How you doing?

31:57.880 --> 31:59.394
Okay, I guess.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.079
Just hang tight, Clumsy.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.836
I'm not sure how long this will take
or how long we'll be down here,

32:04.920 --> 32:09.597
so, everybody, whatever you do,
don't eat all your rations.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.876
I just ate all my rations!

32:11.960 --> 32:14.520
- Clumsy!
- I'm stress-eating!

32:14.600 --> 32:16.000
I'm coming, Clumsy.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.510
Follow the sound of my voice.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.751
Wait! These tunnels are like a maze.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.480
- We'll just get more lost.
- We gotta do something.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.029
I'm with her. Time for some action.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.112
We're doing this all wrong.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.236
Smurfette!

32:29.320 --> 32:31.437
I'm close, Clumsy. Almost there.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.194
That's just the echo playing tricks on us.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.237
- Anybody?
- I'm here.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.835
I'm here right around this corner.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.434
Hey, everybody?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.992
My light is going out.

32:47.080 --> 32:50.710
That is it! I'm punching us out of here.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.195
It's collapsing.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.830
Hefty! Put those fists away
before you get us killed!

32:57.920 --> 32:59.991
At least I'm trying something.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.555
- I'm gonna blow us out of here!
- No!

33:02.640 --> 33:04.199
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't!

33:04.280 --> 33:05.430
Too late!

33:16.360 --> 33:18.352
Clumsy?

33:39.080 --> 33:40.673
- Hey, Smurfette.
- Clumsy!

33:48.120 --> 33:50.112
Hang on. I'm coming, Clumsy bro.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.795
I got you, little buddy.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.755
Yeah!

34:10.560 --> 34:11.880
Stampede!

34:12.520 --> 34:15.752
I think my rations are coming up.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.239
What? What's so funny?

34:36.320 --> 34:38.630
Now, that's what I call
"talking out of your butt."

34:40.040 --> 34:41.156
Oh, boys.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.916
Would anyone be interested in knowing
that we're in sight of three tall trees?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.070
- All right.
- Yeah, we are.

34:46.159 --> 34:49.152
And Bucky is gonna get us there extra fast.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.436
- Bucky?
- Seems like a Bucky to me.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.349
Hit it, Bucky!

35:02.840 --> 35:03.990
Smurfette?

35:05.240 --> 35:07.550
Before you say anything, just listen.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.276
Now, I know yesterday I might have been
a bit tough on you and the boys,

35:13.360 --> 35:16.194
and I know there are times
I'm a little overprotective.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.358
Okay, a lot overprotective.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.274
But you have to understand, you snuck out.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.113
You have to be more careful.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.752
Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize,

35:35.840 --> 35:38.912
and I may not say it enough, but you are...

35:42.120 --> 35:43.554
You shine.

35:46.400 --> 35:50.713
So, anyway, we're smurfy?

35:51.760 --> 35:54.912
I think you and the boys
have been grounded long enough.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.915
Smurfette?

36:00.880 --> 36:03.520
Okay. I'm opening the door.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.275
And I'm walking in to talk more.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.750
You there?

36:11.080 --> 36:12.400
Smurfette.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.276
Hefty!

36:24.280 --> 36:25.430
Brainy!

36:28.760 --> 36:32.515
Clumsy! That's not even convincing.

36:32.600 --> 36:37.834
When I find those Smurfs, I will ground them
for a month of blue moons.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.071
What's going on in here?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.712
Well, all right.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.351
Have you ever seen something so beautiful?

36:54.480 --> 36:57.393
Every day, Smurfette. Every day.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.631
- Don't be weird.
- You don't be weird.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.714
We can camp here for the night.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.029
I'll start us a fire.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.755
Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?

37:12.840 --> 37:14.877
A "please" would be nice.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.071
Yes, it would, but I haven't
earned my manners badge,

37:17.160 --> 37:18.560
so get me some firewood.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.518
Clumsy? You okay?

37:20.600 --> 37:23.069
Yeah, sure. It's been fun.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.358
Well, not tons of fun,
but it's had its moments.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.874
Kind of.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.714
You know what I'm trying to say.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.792
It hasn't been that much fun.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.152
Well done, Hefty. Well done.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.395
All right, step one,

37:40.480 --> 37:43.632
the wood should be stacked
into a tepee-like structure.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.677
Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...

37:57.920 --> 38:01.197
You're not even blowing on it.
You're spitting on it.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.392
That's odd. Perhaps the wood
you collected was damp, Hefty.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.517
According to my manual,
it should spark right up.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.429
Hey, I've got an idea.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.879
No, no, no. No, no!
No! No, no, no. No, no, no!

38:16.960 --> 38:20.954
You know, you're right, Brain Man.
Your little book does come in handy.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.636
Shame. Shame on you.
We'd be lost without this book.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.792
My name is Brainy. I'm super smart.
I'm the smart Smurf.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.519
But I can't start a fire.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.312
Okay, the damage is minimal.
The binding's still intact.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.232
It smells good.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.074
Just think, guys.

38:43.240 --> 38:44.720
After all this time,

38:44.840 --> 38:47.833
while we've been going about
our smurfy business back home,

38:47.920 --> 38:51.038
there's been other Smurfs out there,
just like us.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.238
Or they could be nothing like us.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.996
He's right.
We should be prepared for whatever we find.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.152
Those other Smurfs might not even be blue.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.197
Maybe they'll be orange.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.519
I like orange.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.876
What if they all wear glasses?

39:07.960 --> 39:10.031
Or have big, bushy mustaches.

39:10.120 --> 39:14.000
What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth?

39:14.120 --> 39:17.477
And giant claws. And big, beady eyes.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.473
What if they have hands?

39:21.720 --> 39:22.949
Good one, bro.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.151
Listen, it doesn't matter
what they look like.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.754
We still have to warn them.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.113
Gargamel's wrong about me.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.032
It's not my purpose to help him.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.715
I'm meant to save those Smurfs.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.994
And we're gonna help you.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.198
We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.555
And by "together," I mean me and you.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.155
And those guys. But mostly me and you.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.835
Okay, everyone. Smurfy selfie time.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.119
- Say, "Blue cheese."
- Blue cheese!

40:13.120 --> 40:16.158
According to the map,
we should be arriving at a river.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.116
Check.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.515
It's like a workout for my eyeballs.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.513
Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.360
Come on, boy.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.355
You can do it.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.310
What's a little water?

40:38.480 --> 40:39.550
Hey.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.356
What's that, Bucky?

40:47.440 --> 40:50.877
The river's unsafe and full
of dangerous surprises at every bend?

40:52.080 --> 40:53.753
No. I didn't get any of that.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.478
Perhaps Glowbunnies don't swim.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.950
That's too bad.
We'd get there so much faster.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.430
Fear not, my intrepid Team Smurf.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.600
I didn't earn this raft-building merit badge
for nothing.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.079
- Nailed it.
- Impressive, Brainy.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.674
Here.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.512
Stylish and practical.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.473
Now, let's launch this bad boy.

41:30.560 --> 41:34.554
Wait. Remember, this strange river
may hold untold surprises.

41:34.640 --> 41:37.155
- We must be cautious.
- Cautious. Good point.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.833
- And heave...
- Wait.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.719
The currents can be unpredictable.
We must be alert and vigilant.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.712
Vigilance? Good call.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.996
- Now, on three, two...
- Wait!

41:46.080 --> 41:47.434
We must make sure we always...

41:49.280 --> 41:50.396
Pay attention to the...

41:51.200 --> 41:52.316
Rate of speed of the...

41:54.600 --> 41:56.876
Okay, and we are off.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.519
Heave-ho!

42:06.120 --> 42:07.634
- Bye, Bucky.
- Thanks for your help.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.598
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- Bye, little Bucky bro.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.433
- <i>Hasta la</i> bunny.
- See you on the way back!

42:20.240 --> 42:23.199
Hey. What is this thing?

42:23.280 --> 42:25.033
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.317
Now all I want to do is touch it.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.553
At this pace,
Gargamel doesn't stand a chance.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.156
Look. If we follow this river,
we'll be right on course.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.800
Right on course. To the end of our rainbow.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.191
Smurfs? I thought I left you for dead.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.839
Hang on, Smurf Crew.

42:55.840 --> 42:56.830
Gun it!

43:03.880 --> 43:04.870
What the...

43:05.840 --> 43:07.069
No.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.674
Stop ruining things.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.831
Ruining things is my thing.

43:13.840 --> 43:14.910
What?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.673
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.200
Oh, dear.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.399
Clumsy, pull the lever!

43:23.480 --> 43:26.154
Seriously? But you said not to.
Is this a trick?

43:26.240 --> 43:27.515
Pull it now!

43:40.640 --> 43:41.710
Oh, no.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.190
What's this?

43:52.680 --> 43:55.639
Azrael! Do something. It's never gonna stop.

43:55.720 --> 43:59.191
Make the log stop spinning.
This river is killing me.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.315
Look out!

44:09.400 --> 44:10.629
I love you two.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.194
- Yes! We did it!
- We did it!

44:14.280 --> 44:16.636
- See, I always believed we would do it.
- Take that!

44:16.720 --> 44:18.996
Help! Help!

44:19.080 --> 44:21.436
All right. We're still on course.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.749
Double-time it, Hefty.

44:22.840 --> 44:28.154
Help! I'm sinking!
Please. I'm afraid of turtles!

44:28.240 --> 44:31.199
Guys, what's he up to now?

44:31.280 --> 44:32.999
- Help!
- Forget that guy.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.719
My cat can't swim.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.359
We gotta help him.

44:40.440 --> 44:44.275
- Are you crazy? Why?
- Because it's what I do.

44:44.360 --> 44:47.319
- Listen to him!
- But he's our sworn enemy.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.119
He is literally a villain.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.634
I can change!

44:50.720 --> 44:53.838
And I literally wear my heart
on my sleeve, okay?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.475
- That's your shoulder, not a sleeve.
- I like your tattoo!

44:56.560 --> 44:59.439
- We're doing this.
- Smurfette, talk some sense into him.

45:01.080 --> 45:05.154
Brainy, I hate Gargamel more than anyone,
but we're Smurfs.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.800
- We do the right thing.
- Thank goodness for it!

45:07.880 --> 45:09.200
And we have to save him.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.079
I just want to go on record
that I'm decisively against this.

45:12.160 --> 45:15.232
- Whatever. We're doing it.
- Sounds awesome!

45:17.000 --> 45:19.117
- Use this.
- Grab on!

45:23.320 --> 45:25.039
I don't know about this.

45:25.120 --> 45:27.032
You won't regret it.

45:27.160 --> 45:30.551
Thank you. Thank you. Such a kind Smurf.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.836
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

45:32.920 --> 45:36.709
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.
Thanks for asking, but...

45:36.800 --> 45:38.154
I'm still evil, so...

45:40.440 --> 45:41.920
Enjoy drowning.

45:43.160 --> 45:47.552
Hope you're better swimmers
than you are judges of wizards' character.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.996
Brainy. Hefty?

46:17.040 --> 46:18.110
You okay?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.594
Define "okay."

46:20.680 --> 46:22.034
- Where's Clumsy?
- Clumsy!

46:22.120 --> 46:23.679
- Clumsy! Clumsy!
- Clumsy! Clumsy!

46:28.400 --> 46:29.959
I'm good.

46:30.040 --> 46:33.875
- Run away! Run away!
- Hey. I think.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.155
My pack! My manual!
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

46:40.240 --> 46:42.550
My Scout manual!

46:46.440 --> 46:49.114
This is all your fault!

46:49.240 --> 46:51.630
- What?
- Brainy, cut it out.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.315
I'm sorry. Correction.
This is your fault, too.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.436
Leave her out of this.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.432
Hefty, I don't need you
to fight my fights for me.

46:57.520 --> 46:59.318
Wait, now you're mad at me, too?

46:59.400 --> 47:03.314
Smurfette, you're the one that got us
into this whole mess in the first place.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.790
Hey, I was ready to do this on my own.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.270
Great. So much for Team Smurf.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.353
- I want to yell about something!
- Stay out of this, Clumsy.

47:11.440 --> 47:14.239
That's it, Brain Man.
It's time for you to earn your manners badge.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.470
Stop it!

47:17.920 --> 47:19.036
Take cover!

48:03.200 --> 48:04.953
Who are you? What do you want?

48:06.040 --> 48:07.076
Her.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.393
- Move.
- Smurfette!

48:13.480 --> 48:16.040
- What should we do with her?
- Look at that hair.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.389
- Where's she from?
- And that dress.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.230
It's you.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.993
You're a girl.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.835
She's a girl.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.112
This is her.
This is the Smurf I was telling you about.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.675
The one from the wall?

48:54.760 --> 48:56.672
She's real?

48:57.640 --> 48:58.915
I'm Smurflily.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.118
Hi. I'm Smurfette.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.760
Oh, my geez-to-petes! I'm Smurfblossom.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.752
Nice to meet you. We don't have a Smurfette.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.111
But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,

49:10.200 --> 49:11.759
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy,
Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...

49:11.840 --> 49:12.956
Hey.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.838
Everyone can just introduce themselves later.

49:14.920 --> 49:17.435
Look at you. You're so different.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.113
I mean, sorry, but it's true.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.590
Do you know how to start a fire
with just rope and a stick?

49:21.680 --> 49:24.798
I do. I can show you.
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.395
She's the best at that kind of thing.
Right, Stormy?

49:31.880 --> 49:32.996
That means "yes."

49:33.080 --> 49:35.470
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
What about a double rainbow?

49:35.560 --> 49:38.473
What about an upside down rainbow?

49:38.560 --> 49:39.630
So, is your favorite song...

49:39.720 --> 49:43.191
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

49:43.280 --> 49:45.715
'Cause mine is. Your dress is so pretty.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.793
Smurfblossom, remember,
work on that filter, okay?

49:48.920 --> 49:51.515
- Right. Filter, filter.
- What's your deal anyway?

49:52.640 --> 49:55.474
Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.880
- Garga?
- Garga?

49:56.960 --> 49:57.996
Garga-what?

49:58.080 --> 50:00.595
He's a dangerous wizard
who wants to capture all Smurfs

50:00.680 --> 50:02.592
and use them for his evil magic.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.672
And he knows about your lost village.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.194
"Lost village"?

50:07.600 --> 50:09.751
You're the ones who are lost, not us.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.595
We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.957
What do we do with these blue blobs?

50:20.080 --> 50:21.150
Bring them along.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.550
Come on, Smurfette.
I'm gonna show you my room.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.518
You can tell me all about Gargasmell.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.239
But first, do you want to hear
my favorite song again?

50:27.320 --> 50:29.710
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

50:29.800 --> 50:31.200
All right, move.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.552
- Girl Smurfs mean business.
- You got that right.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.793
Open the gate!

50:53.640 --> 50:55.120
The girls are back!

51:17.080 --> 51:19.390
Where did they find them?

51:21.680 --> 51:23.399
Is there something wrong with them?

51:23.480 --> 51:25.676
- Are they sick?
- Are they food?

51:25.760 --> 51:28.070
No, no, no. They're Smurfs, just like us.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.800
Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.

51:30.880 --> 51:35.591
"Boy." That's a funny word.
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.434
Look at me. I'm a boy Smurf.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.990
- I like 'em.
- Where do they come from?

51:42.080 --> 51:43.434
- What is that?
- Look at their hair.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.715
- You can see their tails.
- Look.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.314
- Hey, watch it!
- Brainy's log, day two.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.800
We've encountered a rare new life-form.

51:47.880 --> 51:48.996
Are there more like you?

51:49.080 --> 51:50.639
They are at times very intimidating.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.235
- Are you gonna stay here?
- And they smell nice.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.959
- Hello, boy.
- More on that later.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.394
- I want one!
- Boundaries!

51:56.480 --> 51:58.995
Okay, that... That's enough of that!

51:59.080 --> 52:02.039
They're my friends.
That's Hefty, Brainy and Clumsy.

52:02.120 --> 52:04.874
- Hey, there!
- Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy. Got it.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.155
We should do name tags.

52:06.240 --> 52:08.471
Wait, where are your boys?

52:08.600 --> 52:10.876
You won't find any boys here.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.798
I am Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.436
This is called an introduction.
So, now, you go.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.510
- I...
- Don't get too close, Willow.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.319
Something's not right here.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.869
I promise we're only here to help.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.879
We came to warn you
about the evil wizard, Gargamel.

52:58.960 --> 53:02.397
He has a map with a landmark
leading him to three tall trees.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.676
- Show 'em, Brainy.
- Snappy.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.557
Don't try any funny stuff, bug.

53:20.120 --> 53:23.477
I hate to break it to you,
but those aren't trees.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.953
They're waterfalls.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.872
Gargamel's going the wrong way.

53:36.960 --> 53:42.638
And if he went there,
then that means the Swamp of No Return.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.951
There's no way he could survive.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.593
Help me! Help me!

53:48.960 --> 53:50.713
There's no way I'll survive!

53:52.160 --> 53:55.153
With all due respect,
you don't know Gargamel.

53:56.320 --> 54:00.280
Yeah, well, with no due respect,
you don't know us.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.238
Trust us, he's a goner.

54:02.320 --> 54:06.109
Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?
Check things out.

54:06.200 --> 54:10.479
And leave you here with these four?
No way. Look at that one.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.120
He can't be normal.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.237
I think we'll be just fine here.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.630
Spitfire!

54:30.480 --> 54:33.200
Okay. So, what does this Gargamel look like?

54:33.280 --> 54:36.114
You know, he's your typical wizard.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.591
Long black robe,
lives alone with his cat and his bird.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.194
It's sad, really.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.351
You're coming with me. You can point him out.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.830
Hey. There's no way he's getting on a...

54:47.040 --> 54:50.670
I feel the need to remind you,
my name is Clumsy.

54:52.520 --> 54:53.874
Clumsy!

54:53.960 --> 54:56.236
Don't worry. Clumsy's in good hands.

54:56.320 --> 54:59.597
Stormy is the sweetest, in her own way.

54:59.680 --> 55:03.276
All right, girls, in the meantime,
our guests have had a long journey,

55:03.400 --> 55:08.156
so let's show them some hospitality,
Smurfy Grove style.

55:23.520 --> 55:24.556
Come on.

55:27.080 --> 55:28.150
Go.

55:39.520 --> 55:41.432
Hey, Smurfette, check this out.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.590
Come on!

57:05.640 --> 57:08.075
Flap, Monty. Flap vigorously.

57:08.160 --> 57:12.154
Use your mighty condor wings
to carry your master to safety.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.870
Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!

57:21.760 --> 57:22.876
Devil fish!

57:24.000 --> 57:28.199
Where is my lost Smurf village?

57:31.880 --> 57:34.349
What? Smurfs!

57:35.400 --> 57:37.710
Why won't they just die?

57:37.800 --> 57:40.110
Monty, retrieve them!

57:40.200 --> 57:44.319
He exists, all right.
He and his stinky cat and his dodo bird.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.120
They've been terrorizing us
the entire journey.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.919
He didn't like us from the start.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.798
He never could find our village.

57:50.880 --> 57:53.475
So then he made a plan to capture us all,

57:53.560 --> 57:55.950
and that's when Gargamel created Smurfette.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.394
- Anyways...
- Hold up.

57:57.480 --> 58:00.393
Smurfette was created by this Gargamel?

58:00.480 --> 58:03.518
Yeah. From a lump of clay.
Really cool story, actually.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.398
I knew I didn't trust her.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.358
You'd like her if you get to know her.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.911
She's just like you, but nice.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.912
Hold on. We got a bogey coming in.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.759
That's no bogey.
That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!

58:18.080 --> 58:19.309
Here, you fly.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.791
That's not a great idea.
Flying's not really my thing.

58:22.880 --> 58:24.360
Have you ever flown before?

58:24.440 --> 58:25.920
Well, no.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.071
Well, then how do you know
it's not your thing?

58:29.680 --> 58:30.875
He's coming back.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.679
- What do I...
- Hurry!

58:33.760 --> 58:34.876
What do I do now?

58:36.120 --> 58:37.156
Good move!

58:37.280 --> 58:40.079
- Now, do it again!
- Okay.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.429
Thanks.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.840
Yes. Wait a minute.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.955
I don't recognize that other Smurf.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.269
They found my lost Smurf village.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.275
Hey, I've got an idea.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.875
Spitfire, spit fire!

59:21.160 --> 59:22.958
I like the way you think.

59:23.040 --> 59:26.272
I guess I'm pretty good
with dragonflies after all.

59:37.160 --> 59:38.389
Monty!

59:38.480 --> 59:41.359
What have they done to you,
my glorious bird of prey?

59:44.480 --> 59:48.520
Smurfs!

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.558
Shiatsu or Swedish?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.510
Probably Swedish.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.113
So, about all that stuff
I said back at the beach...

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.760
I guess I kind of overreacted.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.752
Yeah. Me, too.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.911
So, we good?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.231
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, guys.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.592
Isn't this place awesome?

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.480
Doesn't she look great?

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.472
It's like she's one of us now.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.677
She should stay with us forever.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.517
One, she always looks great.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.037
And two, this is getting
a little out of hand, don't you think?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.589
Sorry. I can't take you seriously
with that mask on your face.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.959
Hey, Smurfette, we did
what we came here to do.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.679
These Smurfs know about Gargamel.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.673
So, come on, let's start
thinking about heading home.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.750
Home?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.150
But I...

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.475
It's time to go.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.669
Smurfette?

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.513
Incoming!

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.675
Turns out I do do well with dragonflies.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.959
They were right. This Gargamel character,
he's real, and he's headed this way.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.872
Oh, no. See? I told you...

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.679
Put a cork in it, Smurfette.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.071
The way I see it, you and your little
boyfriends led him straight to us.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.629
But, of course,
that was your plan all along, wasn't it?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.315
Smurfstorm, easy.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.234
Little Miss Yellow Hair
isn't even a real Smurf.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.190
She was created by Gargamel.
The Clumsy blob told me so himself.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.470
What?

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.120
Smurfette, is that true?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.357
It's not like that.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.716
She was made to help him find Smurfs.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.554
Smurfette came here to help you. We all did.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.599
It's okay, Hefty. This is all my fault.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.719
Girls, protection mode.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.880
Come on, bro, let's help.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.314
Isn't this exciting?

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.916
Hold.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.510
Hold.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.350
Now!

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.034
Surrender, wizard.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.713
What? Wizard?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.360
He's so old.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.033
- Is he wearing a disguise?
- Look at his face.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.600
This is impossible.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.273
He doesn't seem so tough.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.671
Yeah, Gargamel! That's what you get
when you attack Smurfy Grove.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.390
- Gargamel? What are you talking about?
- No, no, no, wait. This is a mistake.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.630
- What?
- Smurfette?

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.040
That's Papa.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.952
- Papa?
- Papa?

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.633
There's another funny word.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.519
Papa. Papa. Papa!

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.239
Smurfblossom, no.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.994
Breathe deep
and step away from the Papa-thing.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.675
Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.994
Hey.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.072
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Smurfjade.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.834
Where are the boys?

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.640
- 'Sup, Papa?
- Hello there.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.995
I rode a dragonfly!

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.790
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.712
How did you find us?

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.190
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.674
Yeah, that's clear.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.310
Look, you four are coming home with me. Now.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.880
Not so fast, Papa-thing.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.032
"Papa-thing"? Are you the one in charge here?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.431
That's right.
I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.239
I'm afraid that's quite impossible,

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.073
because I happen to be
the leader of the Smurfs.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.958
Whatever you say, Papa-thing.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.316
Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.437
Well, if the thing fits...

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.274
By the way, where'd you learn those moves?

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.714
Self-taught, actually.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.029
Impressive.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.110
Thank you.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.192
You're quite welcome.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.715
Okay, not really sure what's happening here,

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.757
but what about Gargamel?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.480
What? What is all this talk about Garga...

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.276
Gargamel!

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.670
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.036
- No!
- I hope so.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.719
- Everybody run!
- Arm yourselves!

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.315
Prepare for Garmageddon!

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.316
This way!

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.553
Spears, now!

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.677
Gargamel says freeze!

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.915
That's right. Smurf-tested,
Gargamel-approved,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.391
grade-A, first-class,
high-octane freeze balls.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.115
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.270
Look out!

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.472
Well, I assume they'll still work
if I don't shout "freeze ball,"

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.279
but we'll never know.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.397
- Freeze ball!
- Smurfette!

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.149
- Hefty.
- It's over, Smurfette.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.193
Monty, bag o' Smurfs.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.955
It's time for you to run.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.952
- No!
- Three more for pickup.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.800
Smurfette. My little creation.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.952
You finally did what you were made for.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.271
No. It's not true.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.550
Of course it is.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.472
Why do you think you led me here?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.792
Why do you think you saved me on the river?

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.714
It was all part of the plan.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.396
No matter how hard you try,
you can't escape your destiny.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.916
And now, you're really
of no use to me anymore.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.480
Freeze ball!

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.670
Yes, these freeze balls
only work on real Smurfs.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.753
And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.913
Thank you for everything.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.517
Smurfette? How could you do this to us?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.910
Because it was her purpose.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.033
<i>Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs.</i>

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.399
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.870
No, Snappy.
I've done too much damage already.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.874
<i>We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.</i>

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.156
<i>We're Smurfs. We do the right thing.</i>

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.037
I'm not even a real Smurf.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.879
I'm not a real Smurf.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.549
We need more power!

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.557
Faster, Monty. Faster.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.868
Yes.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.553
The jiggler's jiggling.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.393
The spinny thing is spinning.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:23.709
The smoke is going up.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.473
The bubblers are bubbling.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.750
Perfect!

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.957
It's almost there.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.151
Just keep running, old bird.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.113
Here's what we're going to do.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.510
- I pick this lock.
- Yeah?

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.956
- We swing to that shelf.
- Yeah?

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.032
- Pick up something heavy.
- Yeah?

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.395
And use it to kill the bird!

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.755
- Yeah! What?
- Yeah! Wait.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.718
You want us to kill the bird?

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.951
Fine. We'll just knock him unconscious.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.479
- Genius!
- All right, then.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.710
Let's do this.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.793
They have an escape plan,
but they're going to need our help.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.513
It's time to rock the cage.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.034
Don't be weird.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.910
Yes!

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.154
Okay. Now!

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.800
Stop that, Azrael.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.839
I can't calibrate my machine
with all your incessant yammering.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.634
Yes, Azrael, listen to it.
It purrs like a kitten.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:40.155
Look at that. Everything is in sync.
Yes, yes. Good.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.911
Sweet mercy! It's another jailbreak!

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.311
- No, Gargamel. No.
- Quiet down.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.238
You'll all get your turn.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.515
In you go!

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.156
No!

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.116
Yes, that's the stuff.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.880
<i>It's working, it's working, it's working</i>

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.279
I can feel it. I can feel the power.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.509
Check out my wizard mane.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.034
Really, man?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.915
When I'm through with these Smurfs,
I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.476
Almost all the power.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.910
Smurfette.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.038
Smurfette, what a lovely surprise.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.430
Are you done crying in the woods?

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.400
I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.470
What's this?

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.473
I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.077
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you,
my true Papa.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.515
- Impossible.
- She can't be serious.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.193
No, no, no, she would never.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.478
Even if I did believe you, which I don't,

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.553
what could you possibly offer me
that I don't already have?

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.678
A tiny little massage that I can't even feel?

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.753
How about the rest of the Smurfs?

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.991
Yeah, right. Wait, what?

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:31.600
Just think of all the power you'll have
once I reveal the location of Smurf Village.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.079
Let's see now.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.311
One hundred more Smurfs,
that's ten times the power...

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.676
No. If you carry the one...

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.672
Whatever. It's a lot more power.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.719
Now, why are you doing this?

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.514
I'm so tired of being good.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.435
Use your power to transform me
back to my evil self.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.191
Your loyalty has returned to you.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.272
So, do we have a deal?

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.874
Smurfette, no!

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.600
Quiet, you vile blue rats. I'm thinking.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.756
Okay, I'm done. Let's do it.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.356
One evil Smurfette coming right up!

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.632
Wait. Of course!

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.390
What? What's happening?

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.631
No! No!

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.035
What are you doing?

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.917
Yeah! Go, Smurfette!

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.313
Azrael, help! More power!

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.913
What are we going to do?

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.156
Bingo. We Smurfboard.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.195
Team Smurf!

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.794
Payback time.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.000
No!

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.316
Smurfintine! Smurfintine!

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.513
I'm okay. Yeah!

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.640
I thought we were goners.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.393
All right. Everybody. Thank goodness.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.073
- All right!
- I'm okay!

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.834
She did it! She did it!

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.240
Where's Smurfette?

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.150
Hey.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.430
Smurfette?

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.915
What happened?

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.672
This is what she once was.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.160
No. No, no, no.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.312
There's gotta be something I can do.
There's gotta be a spell.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.880
There's gotta be something. I know there is.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.873
Where is it? What page? Must be here.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.112
"Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold."
No, that's not it.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.192
- Papa.
- Which spell? Which spell?

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.839
Papa.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.391
We won't find the answer to this in a book.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.799
Let's take her home.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.155
She never thought she was a real Smurf.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.914
But she was the truest Smurf of all.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.317
Why is everyone crying?

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.232
It's Smurfette.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.277
She's a lump of clay.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.671
No, Clumsy, it's me. I'm right here.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.120
Smurfette?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.520
It's Smurfette. It's Smurfette!

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.320
- Quiet, Clumsy.
- Let him be, Brainy.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.596
We all grieve in our own way.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.435
- She's here!
- Poor little bro. I know how he feels.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.079
Yeah!

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.310
Smurfette!

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.392
Hefty, not you, too.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.959
You're all right!

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.152
Don't ever do that to me again.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.516
I won't. I promise.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.914
Yes, yes, yes!

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.394
You never cease to amaze me.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.313
<i>So, as for that burning question...</i>

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.119
What's a Smurfette?

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.272
Well, I don't need a book
to tell you she's...

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.919
Right.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.232
Smurfette can't be defined by just one word.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.834
She's many things.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.799
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's my new best friend.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.190
Smurfette is a bunny wrangler.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.794
She's tough.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.554
Not as tough as me, but tough enough.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:06.319
Smurfette can be anything she wants to be.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.916
- What's going on in there?
- Goodbye!

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.233
Say, "Blue cheese!"

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.515
Blue cheese!

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:13.600
<i>I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs,</i>
<i>and you ruined everything.</i>

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.990
<i>I knew I should have gotten a dog</i>
<i>from the shelter.</i>

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.597
<i>I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?</i>
<i>I'm saying it to be constructive.</i>

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.712
<i>You're a useless feline.</i>

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.710
<i>That's just mean. That's mean.</i>
<i>There was a line, and you crossed it.</i>

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.189
<i>I was just jib-jabbing,</i>
<i>and you crossed that line, and that stung.</i>

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.634
<i>I demand an apology.</i>

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.510
<i>You were going to learn this</i>
<i>one way or another,</i>

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.638
<i>but I am not your real father.</i>

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.714
<i>But that doesn't matter now.</i>
<i>What matters is destroying the Smurfs.</i>

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.951
<i>Any thoughts? I mean, I have thoughts.</i>

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.072
<i>But I always like to spitball</i>
<i>off of your thoughts.</i>

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.235
<i>Azrael, I'm not going to sugarcoat this.</i>
<i>Your ideas are terrible.</i>

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.271
<i>I can't think with this music.</i>

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.159
<i>Can someone please shut off the music?</i>

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:10.473
<i>And what's with all these words</i>
<i>scrolling in front of me?</i>

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.672
<i>Did the Smurfs do this</i>
<i>so that I would be distracted</i>

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.195
<i>and not be able to destroy them as easily?</i>

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.633
<i>"Matte painters"?</i>
<i>I don't even know what that means.</i>

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.200
<i>Someone just made that up, right?</i>

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.880
<i>I feel sorry for whoever "Matte" is.</i>

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.759
<i>"Look development artists"?</i>

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.196
<i>Yes, of course, let's develop some looks.</i>

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.036
<i>Like maybe a really angry look,</i>
<i>because you two totally ruined my plans.</i>

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.193
<i>Am I going mad, Azrael?</i>

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.318
<i>For the last time,</i>
<i>get them to shut off this music!</i>
