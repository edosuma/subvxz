00:05.840 --> 00:07.806
Ladies and gentlemen
of the hallway,

00:07.808 --> 00:09.641
It's yearbook time!

00:11.846 --> 00:13.245
Hi, page 42.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.314
Hi, pages 27, 34, and 58.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.815
You're doing too much.
You should calm down.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.353
Yearbooks!
Find out who we are

00:21.355 --> 00:22.855
And what we really
think about each other.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.656
You wanna know
what i think about you?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.291
-No, i do not.
-But i wanna tell you.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.260
-I don't think you need to.
-I'm gonna do it anyway.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.294
-Don't do it.
-It's been a while.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.113
I'm asking you
not to do it.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.931
I'm gonna do it.
You wanna run, or you want it
straight in the face?

00:32.933 --> 00:35.234
Well, i wanna run,
but how would that look?

00:35.970 --> 00:38.937
(humming scales)

00:41.776 --> 00:43.609
You guys wouldn't judge me
if i run, right?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.811
(humming scales)

00:47.314 --> 00:49.214
Come on, man.
There's always
another option.

00:50.351 --> 00:54.219
(screams)

00:56.290 --> 00:57.289
You okay now?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.690
Hmm. That was good.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.427
You know else is good?
Yearbooks.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.529
All of our classmates
say what they think of us.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.497
Yearbook, find out
how we'll be remembered.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.434
Guess what. You took
another nice picture,
you freak.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.302
Thanks, farkle.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.336
How will you be remembered?

01:11.338 --> 01:12.671
Did they do it to you again?

01:12.673 --> 01:15.307
"most likely to be farkle..."

01:15.309 --> 01:16.909
Farkle.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.510
I didn't think
i'd win it again this year,
but i did.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.412
What does that
mean exactly, farkle?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.815
How should i know?
They turned being me
into a category.

01:22.817 --> 01:25.651
Hey, riley won most likely
to smile herself to death.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.253
Aw. Well, who wouldn't
wanna go that way?

01:28.255 --> 01:31.824
I mean, when the time comes,
why you gotta be a gloomy gus?

01:31.826 --> 01:34.660
(scoffs) riles, i don't think
they meant this as a good thing.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.662
They're making fun of me,
and they're making fun
of you too.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.897
-What?
-Would you stop smiling?

01:38.899 --> 01:41.433
I'm not smiling, maya.
This is my upset face.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.669
This is smiling.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.777
You know what?
I don't care what they say.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.612
Neither do i.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.446
-I don't care
what they say at all.
-Neither do i at all.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.415
(growls)

01:57.818 --> 01:59.918
How did this stuff
even get in here?
We're the editors.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.020
Wow, we must have
very poor quality control.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.807
What did you get, huckleberry?

02:04.808 --> 02:06.625
I got most likely to be okay
with anything that ever happens.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.010
How do you feel about that?

02:08.011 --> 02:09.394
Well, actually,
i'm okay with that.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.662
Oh!

02:12.399 --> 02:15.334
I'm not
all sunshine and rainbows.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.503
I have a dark side.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.471
Let me see your dark-side face.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.908
-Aw.
-Aw.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.578
Look, guys, we're not gonna make
a huge deal out of this, are we?

02:26.580 --> 02:29.448
-Yeah. Who cares?
-It's only what
everybody thinks of us.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.016
What's more important
to you?

02:31.017 --> 02:32.583
What you think of yourself
or what other people
think of you?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.820
-What i think of myself.
-Yeah.

02:34.822 --> 02:38.790
And what i think of myself
is that it really bothers me
what other people think of me.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.926
-Yeah.
-Well, forget about it.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.495
It's not like you can just
turn around and be someone new.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.663
Yeah.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.704
This is me now.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.507
-Farkle?
-Nope, farkle is gone.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.475
You will never see him again.

Okay, what have we got here?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.259
I'm donnie barnes.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.644
Really, farkle, of all the names
in the world you could pick
for another personality,

04:06.647 --> 04:08.080
You pick donnie barnes?

04:08.082 --> 04:09.481
You don't get it, do you?

04:09.483 --> 04:11.049
I'm donnie barnes, regular guy.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.485
I'd see that movie.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.089
Donnie barnes is the real me.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.691
Farkle minkus is my goofy
other personality.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.493
No, you're farkle.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.195
Look, i'll prove it to you.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.864
See?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.702
How did you possibly do that?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.505
I don't wanna be
most likely to be farkle.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.674
Face it, cowboy.
There's a new
pretty boy in town.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.476
Thank you. I am...

04:39.446 --> 04:41.046
Donnie barnes.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.637
Are you gonna do something?

04:43.638 --> 04:45.093
Because this is where
you do something, right?

04:45.094 --> 04:46.549
Are you gonna do something?
Is there a lesson?

04:46.553 --> 04:47.986
You got a lesson?
Is there a lesson?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.589
-Iceland.
-Iceland!

04:50.591 --> 04:51.690
You all fixed?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.092
No? I don't think
he's all fixed.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.495
If that was riley,
you know you'd fix her.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.064
-Sit down, lucas.
-Oh, you know i'm right.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.835
Iceland and greenland.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.638
What do you think about them,
mr. Barnes?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.774
When i look like this,
i don't have to think,
right, lucas?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.076
Dude, i won
the scholar athlete award.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.711
Ooh, nerd alert!

05:14.615 --> 05:17.616
Iceland and greenland, anybody?

05:17.618 --> 05:20.252
-Iceland is a land of ice.
-Wrong.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.888
-Then greenland
is a land of green.
-Wrong.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.757
Then who cares?
Stupid countries
don't even know who they are.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.160
(muttering) stupid countries.

05:28.162 --> 05:31.029
The vikings discovered
this beautiful green country.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.798
-I come from vikings.
-You do?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.066
You don't know me.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.669
Okay.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.271
So, the vikings,
they didn't want anyone else
taking their new country,

05:39.273 --> 05:42.240
So they decided
to name it iceland.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.509
Everyone figures
it must be cold.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.179
Nobody wants to go there.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.848
So they made everybody
think of it in that way
even though it wasn't true?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.700
That's right.

05:51.701 --> 05:53.551
Then another viking comes along,
erik the red,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.254
And he discovers
a land of snow and ice.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.223
And he wants everyone
to go there instead,

05:58.225 --> 06:00.258
So he names that greenland,

06:00.260 --> 06:02.027
And everyone goes there.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.662
The jerks!

06:04.965 --> 06:08.700
So you're saying
the perception of a thing
doesn't make it so?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.002
I'm saying people
are always gonna say stuff.

06:11.004 --> 06:15.006
How you react to what they say
is what makes you
the person you are.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.642
-So don't react.
-That's right.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.678
Just keep on smiling.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.246
Would you, please?

06:21.248 --> 06:24.032
Lesson over.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.817
And nothing anybody else says
is ever going to make me feel
any different.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.854
Hey, maya, lucas,

06:28.856 --> 06:30.722
Congratulations on winning
favorite couple.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.761
I feel different.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.731
How is that possible?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.699
How could anybody ever see
me and lucas as a couple?

06:40.701 --> 06:41.900
Everybody does.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.635
But we're so much alike.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.204
And they're so different.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.340
But we're like a summer rain.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.742
And they're like fire.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.314
Daddy, remember
when you told me
not to react?

06:56.316 --> 06:57.716
Yes.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.117
I'm gonna react.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.697
You open this bay window
right now.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.599
I wish to be alone.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.135
Ring power!

07:17.137 --> 07:18.737
Curses!

07:20.707 --> 07:21.873
Hey, riley, funny question.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.742
Have you seen
everything black i own?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.877
Oh, hey, look at you.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.746
There is no more riley.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.115
My name is morotia m. Black.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.185
What does the m. Stand for?

07:33.187 --> 07:34.619
Morotia.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.789
Poor, dark thing, you.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.691
Yeah, she's very depressed.

07:39.693 --> 07:44.329
Oh? Well, that's too bad.

07:44.331 --> 07:48.800
You know,
the neighbor's golden retriever
just gave birth to six puppies.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.902
Must fight cute!

07:50.904 --> 07:54.239
Oh, but have they met
the other neighbor's
bunnies yet?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.708
-(gasps)
-they just did.

07:56.710 --> 08:02.147
There is a bunny and a puppy
nibbling at opposite ends
of the same carrot.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.215
Gah!

08:05.886 --> 08:07.819
They're gonna kiss.
This is fantastic.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.921
-That's exactly
what the pony said.
-No!

08:09.923 --> 08:11.923
Cut it out!

08:11.925 --> 08:14.025
-You snap out of it.
-And do what?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.694
Smile myself to death?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.396
Riley is gone.
Everybody else is right.

08:18.398 --> 08:23.668
I'm wasting my life,
and i'm tired of being
chip-chip-chipper.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.005
You are being ridiculous.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.807
Is there anybody
more ridiculous than you?

08:28.809 --> 08:30.342
Knock, knock.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.679
-Who's there?
-I'm donnie barnes!

08:34.681 --> 08:37.949
I can't believe i'm saying this,
but i really miss, "ladies."

08:37.951 --> 08:39.985
That's a catchphrase,

08:39.986 --> 08:42.020
And donnie barnes don't need
no stinking catchphrase.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.322
You know why?
I'm donnie barnes.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.824
Shplidow!

08:47.961 --> 08:49.361
Okay, i'm out.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.830
Riley, i came over
to check on you.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.832
Because, well,
i kind of expected this.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.267
Donnie barnes, regular guy.

08:55.269 --> 08:58.270
Morotia m. Black.
Shplidead inside.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.541
I feel you.
What's say you and i
play by our own rules?

09:03.744 --> 09:07.879
Shall we sit and ponder
on the ridiculous futility
of caring?

09:07.881 --> 09:08.947
Let's do it.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.087
You get me.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.888
Stop. Riley, is this about
the me and lucas best couple
thing?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.356
That doesn't affect me at all.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.994
We need riley back.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.164
There is no value
to the existence of riley.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.733
Well, we need riley back
to get farkle back.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.137
There is no value to
the existence of farkle, dude.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.377
Guys, listen, okay,
i know you're hurt.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.479
I know what people say
can be upsetting,

09:41.481 --> 09:44.215
But i have no interest
living in a world
without riley or farkle.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.918
And i'm not going anywhere
until you two come back.
You hear me?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.853
Maya, the people you knew
aren't here anymore.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.356
Then can you please tell me
where i can find them?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.758
They're in the yearbook.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.861
Keep in touch
and have an awesome summer.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.365
Knowing you is so hard.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.914
Pay no attention
to the bunny night-light.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.285
I'm donnie barnes.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.227
Mom, i need your help.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.029
Oh, i don't think i've ever
heard more beautiful words
come out of that little face.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.165
You're a great
actress/waitress, right?

10:34.167 --> 10:37.836
Well, some have said
my crowd person number three

10:37.838 --> 10:41.373
In <i> hey, mister,</i>
<i>watch out for that car</i>
was life-changing. Yes.

10:41.375 --> 10:45.543
(in cockney accent)
hey, mister, you should have
watched out for that car, yeah!

10:49.182 --> 10:50.548
I need you
to turn me into riley.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.051
-Does riley need to say,
"hey, mister..."
-no.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.219
No?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.421
Well, is she willing to?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.523
I don't know how to do
what she does, all right?

10:58.525 --> 11:02.060
She fixes things.
I break things.
We need someone to be her.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.429
You wanna be riley matthews,

11:04.431 --> 11:06.464
You gotta get inside her soul.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.034
My soul motel has no vacancy.

11:09.036 --> 11:14.873
It is fully occupied
by scary jack-o-lanterns
and candy corns.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.276
Aw, dark riley

11:18.277 --> 11:20.544
Is really scraping the bottom
of the halloween barrel,
now isn't she?

11:21.548 --> 11:24.215
You didn't teach me
enough bad things.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.051
I'm so sorry, honey.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.253
Riley, we need you back
to fix farkle.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.589
It's what you do.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.924
What if we are fixed?
What if this is
who we're supposed to be?

11:34.127 --> 11:37.228
Ma, you gotta help me out here.
If she's not gonna be her,
i will. Show me how.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.964
All right, but before
you become another person,

11:39.966 --> 11:44.002
Understand that
you may learn things about them
you didn't know before.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.872
You may learn a secret
even they don't know
about themselves.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.609
Riley, this is your last chance,
or else, i become you,
and know all of your secrets.

11:51.611 --> 11:55.580
Nonsense. It's impossible
to become somebody else.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.026
(imitating riley)
i love today.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.995
Today is even better
than yesterday,

12:10.997 --> 12:15.200
And yesterday was
the best day ever!

12:15.202 --> 12:20.472
I'd think about tomorrow,
but i am afraid i'd burst
into sparkles.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.140
Oh, there it is. There it is.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.611
If you were better,
perhaps i'd gasp.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.249
-Stop it.
-Stop it.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.085
Gasp.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.495
Please be back to normal.
Please be back to normal.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.196
I'm donnie barnes.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.498
(sighs)

12:51.638 --> 12:52.937
What the...

12:54.107 --> 12:58.042
Life is what we do
between nothings.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.080
Is this a new york thing,
or what is this?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.669
Maya?

13:07.670 --> 13:09.654
Lollipops, and circuses,
and things that rhyme with that.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.092
No! This is your solution, maya?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.960
(shyly) hi.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.096
Hey.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.365
Hi.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.633
No!

13:23.970 --> 13:26.971
Please be back to normal.
Please be back to normal.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.473
What's up, hambone?

13:29.976 --> 13:32.610
Don't worry, daddy.
I'm going to fix
everybody right up.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.145
(screams)

13:35.081 --> 13:37.982
All right, you know what?
It's lucas time.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.051
You're the best farkle we got,
and everyone knows it.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.289
And you are a complete
ray of sunshine.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.456
And you are not.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.159
And that's who we are.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.661
I don't know what this is.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.729
But i do know that if you let
someone say who you are,

13:51.731 --> 13:54.382
Then you really won't be
who you are,

13:54.383 --> 13:57.034
And you certainly won't end up
being who you were meant to be.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.304
If you end this
with iceland or greenland,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.573
I'll give you an a
on the report right now.

14:02.576 --> 14:05.176
Because you are the only one
in here i recognize.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.349
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna stay riley.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.351
I know how much everybody
would miss me if i did.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.019
No, no, stay riley.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.521
Yeah, you're a good riley.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.058
Wait. You like us all like this?

14:20.060 --> 14:22.427
We like riley.
We don't care who plays her.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.495
What about maya?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.098
Nothing we do matters.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.068
Maya, you're the most secure
person in this room.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.669
You have a great life.
Why would you change?

14:31.671 --> 14:33.354
I mean, okay, not great life.

14:33.355 --> 14:35.038
I mean, your family life
could be, you know, better.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.042
But at least
at school, you're, uh...
You're here a lot.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.711
Right?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.079
Little help, please.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.798
Donnie barnes?

14:43.799 --> 14:45.549
I think people should be
the best person they can be.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.552
I agree.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.455
Riley matthews is
the best person i can be.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.058
Maya is gone,
and you're never gonna
see her again.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.796
<i>♪ la la la</i>
<i>la la la ♪</i>

14:58.798 --> 15:01.599
World peace.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.735
And bunnies!

15:11.111 --> 15:14.612
Okay, do cory.
He has to choose
between me and shawn. Go.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.713
Shawn.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.386
I wonder how maya is doing
as riley.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.421
Oh, i hope everything
is going okay.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.424
Coming to terms
with your identity can
be so difficult at their age.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.825
Well, i went through it.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.193
I'm sure you and cory
went through it.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.263
Yeah, i was weird.
Cory was celery.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.866
Something will change
because of this.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.268
When you become someone else,
even though you're just acting,

15:37.270 --> 15:40.271
It's impossible not to discover
something you didn't know
before.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.873
Hmm. Do you ever do maya?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.574
Ooh, i can't.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.177
When you have
strong emotions for someone,

15:46.179 --> 15:48.179
It's like you're too close
to see straight.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.281
Hmm. Do shawn.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.752
Hey, i'm shawn.

15:54.754 --> 15:55.887
That wasn't good.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.256
You having
some issues there, katy?

15:59.859 --> 16:01.192
You set me up.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.361
Huh.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.205
All right, you all say
i'm most likely
to be okay with anything.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.307
Well, i'm not okay
with any of this.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.142
I'm not okay
with all you guys not realizing

16:18.144 --> 16:20.278
That what you say
about people matters.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.248
And i'm not okay with you guys
thinking what people say
about you matters.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.254
You know what happened after
everybody went to greenland
because someone told them to?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.290
-Donnie?
-Riley?

16:32.292 --> 16:33.291
Black swan?

16:33.293 --> 16:35.593
They all died.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.762
Yep.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.932
-What? Really?
-Really.

16:42.268 --> 16:46.738
They came to an inhospitable,
uninhabited ice ball
named greenland

16:46.740 --> 16:48.873
Because someone said
it was pretty,

16:48.875 --> 16:52.377
And the first thing they did
was die.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.632
The jerks!

16:57.633 --> 16:59.550
So please remember,
you shouldn't pay attention
to what everybody says.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.552
Because if you listen
to everybody else,

17:01.554 --> 17:04.288
You just might end up
crashing your little ships
onto the rocks.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.657
But you should listen to
the people who care about you.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.560
Because they have
your best interest at heart.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.862
Right, buddy?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.531
You're much more
than just a regular guy.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.235
Aw, lucas,
you're a very sweet guy.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.338
That's why i always liked you
since i fell into your lap
on the subway.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.806
It's why we should have been
favorite couple,

17:21.808 --> 17:24.559
Because we're so much alike.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.311
You know, it's like
we're two sunshine-y people
from the same sunshine-y family.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.546
That's why i like you so much.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.781
It's like you're my brother.

17:29.783 --> 17:30.848
Oh.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.852
-It's like he's your...
-What?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.320
Whoa.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.722
What just happened?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.691
Uh, nothing.
Nothing happened.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.793
I don't wanna be riley anymore.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.494
Only you're riley. I'm maya.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.997
We don't care what you say.
We're not crashing our ships.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.765
Come back. Come back right now.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.304
(bell ringing)

18:01.381 --> 18:04.248
Wow. There is a lot of light
in this world.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.018
If you let it in, yeah.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.387
You know who taught me that?

18:10.623 --> 18:11.789
Me.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.624
The real you, yeah.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.761
We need you back, riley.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.465
If you wanna listen
to what people say,
listen to the right people.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.733
Listen to me. I'm maya.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.527
-Maya.
-Yeah, sunshine.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.413
Your mom told you
that you might find out
a secret about me.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.015
Did you find anything out
about me that maybe
you should tell me?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.520
No.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.457
Did the bunny and the puppy
really kiss?

18:47.393 --> 18:48.893
Absolutely, riley, they did.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.962
But i know that the pony
didn't actually talk.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.698
I can't keep anything from you.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.300
That's because
i'm a smarty-pants.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.902
Yes, you are.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.540
Can you please
fix everything now?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.343
There it is.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.487
Yeah, we know who we are.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.755
And you know who you are.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.959
You're farkle,
and it's a state of being.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.427
There's only one,

19:23.429 --> 19:25.863
And everybody
who cares about you knows that.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.366
You are in
your own category, farkle.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.868
I'm glad you guys
are back to normal.
I love you both any way you are.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.938
So you're gonna come back too?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.474
-No.
-Why not?

19:36.476 --> 19:39.710
Because people change, lucas.
I think you know that
better than anyone.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.412
And i think
it could be a good thing.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.064
What?

19:43.065 --> 19:44.715
You don't have
to call me donnie barnes.

19:44.717 --> 19:48.052
I made that up.
My name is farkle minkus.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.587
I'm growing up.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.756
And i don't know
what's gonna happen next.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.393
But you guys
are my best friends,
so deal with it.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.440
Okay, farkle,
who are you?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.608
I wanna know
the new rules.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.376
I'm finding out who i am.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.811
You know who you are.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.513
You have your own category
named after you.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.600
What's a farkle anyway?

20:18.601 --> 20:21.686
A farkle is a loyal, loving,
best possible friend
that there could be.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.721
I think everyone
should have one.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.591
But they don't, and i do.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.925
And i never want him to go away.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.395
A farkle is a nerdy, little
scientist genius.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.663
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.065
-Is it?
-No.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.550
Not to me.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.034
And not to the people
who truly care about you.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.837
-So it's okay if i stay
the scientist that i am?
-Yes.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.639
And you'll allow me
to run some tests?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.674
What kind?

20:45.445 --> 20:48.613
In order for
a living organism to thrive,

20:48.615 --> 20:50.481
It needs to be allowed to grow.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.850
I hear you.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.652
I may not wear
my turtlenecks every day.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.887
I'll miss them.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.923
You still wanna
take over the world?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.925
I wanna take over myself first.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.760
But then, yeah, the world.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.696
Well, i'm right here
next to you.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.932
Thanks. I never want that
to change.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.036
-Sign my yearbook?
-Of course.
