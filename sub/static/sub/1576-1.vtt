WEBVTT

00:04.137 --> 00:05.504
Alan.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.705
Hurry up.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.173
The girls are almost here,
and I'm a...

00:08.175 --> 00:11.443
â™ª hunka hunka rotting love.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.512
Alan: Sorry, just
finishing up my costume.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.887
Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.889
You never saw <i>pretty in pink?</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:26.658
Oh, right!
You're molly ringwald.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.293
Ha-ha. I-I'm duckie.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.130
You know, the-the best friend,
the-the scene stealer?

00:31.132 --> 00:34.333
Some would say
the true star of the film.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.101
Who played him, boy george?
(chuckles)

00:37.904 --> 00:40.706
Hey, what do you think
about zombie elvis, baby?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.808
And don't be cruel.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.243
It's great.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.378
You look like both
the impersonator at my wedding

00:46.380 --> 00:47.780
And my ex-wife.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.582
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:50.584 --> 00:54.253
What decays in vegas
stays in vegas.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.355
Oh, hey, uh, did your
friend stacy say anything

00:56.357 --> 00:57.656
About the girl she's
bringing for me?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.324
Uh, just that she's supposed
to be really cute,

00:59.326 --> 01:01.260
And she just moved out here
after a tough breakup.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.395
Ooh, hot, lonely
and damaged.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.097
Duckie's getting lucky.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.233
You know, if duckie
really wants to get lucky,

01:08.235 --> 01:10.736
He'll tell the girls that he's
someone that people remember.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.337
Like ferris bueller.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.875
Fine, you win again, broderick.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.044
God, you know what
I love about Halloween?

01:19.046 --> 01:21.213
You can put "slutty"
in front of any job position,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.215
And it becomes a costume.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.051
Slutty nurse, slutty librarian,
slutty lunch lady.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.719
(groans)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.588
Hey, you didn't know
mrs. Goobadeck

01:29.590 --> 01:32.224
From mark twain elementary.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.693
She rocked that hairnet.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.428
(groaning):
My chest.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.796
Seriously?
W-what's going on?

01:37.798 --> 01:39.631
I don't know, I can't breathe,
my chest is tight.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.632
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.867
Here, here. Sit down.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.236
Um... Oh. Uh, well,
uh, don't worry.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.438
I-I'm sure this is
nothing, but, uh...

01:46.440 --> 01:50.309
I'm going to call an ambulance,
just in case.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.543
Just, uh, just stay calm.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.878
You're gonna be fine.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.581
(whispering):
Help! My friend is dying!

01:55.583 --> 01:57.916
I can't settle down, I think
he's having a heart attack.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.485
Oh, my god, I'm having
a heart attack.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.120
Oh. No, no.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.055
I-I'm just saying that
to get them to hurry.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.256
I'm not just saying that.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.390
I think he's headed
toward the light.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.158
(door bell rings)

02:06.160 --> 02:07.593
I can't feel my left arm.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.228
Um, uh, you're gonna be okay.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.296
It's probably just gas.
Try to fart!

02:12.966 --> 02:13.966
Trick...

02:13.968 --> 02:15.334
Or treat.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.903
Oh, ladies. I'm sorry, you just
got here during a bit of a...

02:17.905 --> 02:19.271
Ooh, I can see
your nipples, officer.

02:19.273 --> 02:23.375
Anything you see will
be held against you.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.078
And I'm harry potter.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.013
But I'm not so hairy.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.214
She's mine.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.416
(groans)

02:31.418 --> 02:32.751
(farts)

02:34.420 --> 02:36.989
Didn't work!

02:47.467 --> 02:49.368
(siren wailing)

02:49.370 --> 02:51.637
Don't worry, we're
almost to the hospital.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.472
Sir, are you taking
any medications?

02:53.474 --> 02:55.774
Well, I take a generic lipitor
and a women's multi-vitamin.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.877
I mean, just so you know,
I take the women's

02:58.879 --> 02:59.945
'cause it has more iron.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.614
Same price, more iron.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.682
Yes, please.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.451
Is he gonna be okay?

03:06.453 --> 03:07.519
We're doing
all we can, sir.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
I can't believe this is
happening, you know?

03:09.356 --> 03:10.355
He's so young!

03:10.357 --> 03:12.224
He leads such
a healthy lifestyle...

03:12.226 --> 03:13.592
Well, except for all the pot.

03:15.495 --> 03:16.828
You know, the-the weed.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.096
The... The ganja.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.733
The ol' mexican spinach.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.537
Alan, if I live,
I'm going to kill you.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.739
Stop it. You are gonna live.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.174
(chuckles)

03:29.176 --> 03:30.409
Is he gonna live?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.477
We're en route
with a 35-year-old male.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.380
Bp is 160/94, pulse is 108.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.749
And he's dressed
as zombie elvis, over!

03:39.018 --> 03:41.420
I-I don't know if you guys
need to know that.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.254
They don't.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.325
By the way, uh,
I'm dressed as...

03:46.327 --> 03:47.526
Ferris bueller?

03:47.528 --> 03:49.528
(laughs)

03:49.530 --> 03:52.097
Hey, hey, at least I took
a chance with my costume.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.166
I mean, elvis and zombies.

03:54.168 --> 03:55.234
It's real original.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.336
Next year, it's vampire obama.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.871
(transylvanian accent):
"yes, we can!"

03:59.873 --> 04:03.108
Excuse me, do you have
anything for the pain?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.510
In my ass?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.079
I know, I know.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.381
I'm just... I'm freaking out
because I'm worried.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.849
I mean, you are my best friend.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.417
And if something were
to happen to you,

04:12.419 --> 04:13.952
I don't know what I would do.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.420
I mean, I-I've already
lost a brother.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.923
I can't lose
you, too!

04:17.925 --> 04:19.458
A-and you're more
of a brother than he was.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.460
And now jake's in the army,
and I'm all alone.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.761
And I don't do well
when I'm alone...

04:22.763 --> 04:23.829
Here, breathe.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.634
Thank you.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.205
Am I crazy, or is, uh,
something happening here?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.844
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:43.950 --> 04:45.584
Oh, good, uh, you made it.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.419
Uh... Oh, I-I'm sorry I pulled
you out of your Halloween party,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.387
I just figured you'd want to...

04:48.389 --> 04:50.622
I wasn't at a Halloween party.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.625
I-I just assumed,
since you're dressed...

04:53.627 --> 04:55.060
So what happened?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.561
I don't know.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.829
We were about to go out,

04:57.831 --> 05:00.265
And he got chest pains
and suddenly collapsed.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.000
Oh, wow.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.835
He's so young.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.270
So fit.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.072
So not you.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.743
Hope he's okay.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.480
I never thought I'd have a boss
better than your brother,

05:15.482 --> 05:17.482
But walden is good people.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.618
He's the best.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.487
The guy has the biggest heart
of anyone I have ever met.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.456
Yep, a heart of gold.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.426
Clogged with arterial plaque.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.361
You've been a good
friend to walden.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.462
He's lucky
to have you.

05:30.464 --> 05:34.466
He's lucky to have you,
too, sister berta.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.468
And, listen, um...

05:36.470 --> 05:40.205
If, god forbid,
the worst happens,

05:40.207 --> 05:42.374
I-I just want you
to know that, uh...

05:42.376 --> 05:45.143
You'll always have
a job at the house.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.146
I mean, we'd have to talk
reduced salaries, but, uh...

05:48.148 --> 05:50.549
What makes you think
he'd leave you the house?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.117
I'm his best friend.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.618
There's nobody closer
to him than me.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.220
I clean his underwear.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.521
I <i>wear</i> his underwear.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.323
(laughs)

05:58.325 --> 05:59.991
Alan harper?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.793
Oh, oh, that's me.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.662
I'm dr. Prajneep.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.464
Your friend had a
mild heart attack.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.299
We put in a stent to
clear the blockage.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.066
Is that bad?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.634
In general,

06:09.636 --> 06:11.036
A heart attack is bad.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.205
But, uh, he should
make a full recovery.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.573
Oh, thank god.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.741
Oh, that is
a huge relief.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.642
Um, is there anything
we should do at home?

06:17.644 --> 06:20.479
I just want to make sure
he has all the care he needs.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.581
Uh, any special diet,
exercises, medications?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.982
If it'd help,

06:23.984 --> 06:26.551
I'd chew up his food and
feed him like a baby bird.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.888
How could that
possibly help?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.157
I'll tell you what
doesn't help-- that tone.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.925
Can we see him?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.360
Soon as he's
in recovery.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.728
Any other questions?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.363
Uh, no, we're just happy
that he's gonna be okay.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.364
Thank you.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.599
My pleasure.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.667
By the way, <i>ferris bueller</i>
<i>is my favorite movie.</i>

06:45.371 --> 06:47.572
Wait, b-berta.
W-where are you going?

06:47.574 --> 06:48.707
We're not supposed
to go back there yet.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.542
I'm a nun at a hospital.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.911
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.653
I'm dead.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.859
And I'm in hell.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.762
Relax.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.063
You're in the hospital.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.433
You had a mild heart attack,
but you're gonna be fine.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.201
I don't feel very good.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.437
That's because they put
a stent in your heart.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.772
But also I feel really good.

07:20.774 --> 07:25.043
That's because they put morphine
in your veins.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.746
We should start keeping morphine
in the house.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.582
I know a guy.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.985
Berta, you're so funny.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.222
I would've missed you so much
if I would've died.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.291
Oh, oh, but you don't
have to worry about that.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.392
Y-you're not going anywhere.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.960
I love you guys.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.261
We love you, too.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.597
You know, when I think about it,

07:45.599 --> 07:48.166
You guys are
my only real family.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.235
Oh, walden, that's so...

07:50.237 --> 07:52.604
Horrible.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.972
Okay.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.475
Saved your life, but whatever.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.610
My life is pathetic.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.680
I mean, thank you guys so much
for being here.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.516
But you're not good enough!

08:04.518 --> 08:07.252
Okay, now it sounds
like my family.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.020
Um...

08:09.022 --> 08:10.021
Maybe you should rest.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.590
You know, just go
to your happy place.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.991
I know a shortcut.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.992
Say when.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.460
Whe...

08:15.462 --> 08:17.863
(squeals)

08:17.865 --> 08:21.099
Dressed as a nun,
giving some guy morphine--

08:21.101 --> 08:23.735
Boy, does this take me
back to high school.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.344
Hey, how you feeling?

08:32.346 --> 08:33.445
I'm all right.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.313
Well, uh, I know

08:35.315 --> 08:37.616
Something that'll
make you feel better.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.784
I made some of my famous
three bean salad.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.220
The secret--

08:42.222 --> 08:44.256
(whispers):
I use four beans.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.126
Garbanzo.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.694
Shh.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.163
You ever look out at the ocean

08:52.165 --> 08:54.466
And think about how small
and insignificant you are?

08:54.468 --> 08:57.836
I don't need the ocean;
I can just call my mother.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.471
I almost died, alan.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.072
But the important thing is
you didn't.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.174
So, now you just have
to listen to your doctors,

09:03.176 --> 09:04.543
Don't stress about anything
and relax.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.978
(shrill laughing)
(screams)

09:06.980 --> 09:09.147
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.818
Sorry.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.887
That was supposed to scare the
life out of trick-or-treaters,

09:15.889 --> 09:16.988
Not you.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.089
This sucks!

09:18.091 --> 09:20.425
How am I the one
with a stent in my heart?

09:20.427 --> 09:22.260
I'm healthy, I-I'm fit.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.095
You sit in front
of the tv every night,

09:24.097 --> 09:26.097
Shoveling a pint of ice cream
down your throat.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.699
Hey, I eat my feelings,

09:27.701 --> 09:29.935
And you are sending me
right back to the freezer.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.503
You know, it just goes to show,

09:31.505 --> 09:33.271
Your life can end
in the blink of an eye.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.106
One day you're here,
the next day you're gone.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.775
That's why I live
by the philosophy

09:36.777 --> 09:39.411
"one day I'm here,
the next day I'm still here."

09:39.413 --> 09:43.682
You know, if-if I would have
died, who would have missed me?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.384
What are you talking about?
I would, berta would.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.920
A-and you just got an e-mail
from netflix the other day

09:48.922 --> 09:50.989
That literally said,
"we miss you."

09:52.858 --> 09:56.461
You know, other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.029
At least you got jake.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.231
Well, that's true.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.400
I'll always have
my little guy.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.269
Although, in his last e-mail,

10:04.271 --> 10:07.472
He, uh, asked me when the
fourth of July was this year.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.410
But, yes, I'm very lucky.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.947
Do you know how much
I would give to have a kid

10:15.949 --> 10:18.550
Who didn't understand
the concept of a calendar?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.053
All I have is money.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.655
Yeah.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.524
'cause I wouldn't give up jake
for a billion dollars.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.329
I got to make some changes.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.564
Changes are good.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.165
Uh, you know,
I remember when I switched

10:34.167 --> 10:36.034
From <i>american idol</i> to <i>the voice.</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:38.470
My life turned around

10:38.472 --> 10:40.972
Like blake shelton's chair.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.641
You know what?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.776
I want to have a kid of my own.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.578
What?

10:46.580 --> 10:48.947
Yeah, I want something
to give my life meaning.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.650
I want somebody
I can love unconditionally.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.952
Someone I can teach,
someone I can nurture,

10:53.954 --> 10:55.987
Someone I can leave
all this to.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.155
Well...

10:57.157 --> 11:00.792
I mean, I don't know
what to say, except...

11:00.794 --> 11:02.627
Papa?

11:02.629 --> 11:04.429
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:10.603 --> 11:11.803
Have you thought
this through?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.104
Having a kid
is a lot of work.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.374
Having you is
a lot of work.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.677
You know, having a child
would give my life meaning.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.211
Otherwise, all this
has been for nothing,

11:20.213 --> 11:21.713
And that's difficult
to accept.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.947
You know
what's difficult?

11:22.949 --> 11:25.684
Removing a marble
your kid shoved up his nose.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.818
I did something like that.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.286
I jammed a penny up there.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.955
I was trying to get a gumball
to fall out of my butt.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.891
But a kid
is permanent.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.359
It's not like you're dating.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.661
You can't just stop calling
or change your number

11:36.663 --> 11:38.797
Or fake your own death
because they annoy you.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.131
You do that to women?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.433
No, they do it to me.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.037
Look, I-I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm being negative,

11:46.039 --> 11:48.306
Because the truth is,
you know, kids are amazing.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.575
But you just had
this big health scare,

11:50.577 --> 11:52.510
And you're probably not
in the best frame of mind

11:52.512 --> 11:53.912
To make life decisions.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.848
I mean, this morning,
you cried at a beer commercial.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.385
Yeah, but the horse and
the puppy were best friends!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.053
Look,

12:02.055 --> 12:03.922
Having a heart attack
didn't make me realize

12:03.924 --> 12:06.491
I want to have a kid,
it made me realize

12:06.493 --> 12:08.059
I don't want to live
another day without one.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.028
It was like a wake-up call.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.362
All right.

12:11.364 --> 12:15.500
If you really want to do this,
I will be here to support you.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.901
From my room.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.238
Which, fyi, is way too drafty
to use as a nursery.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.507
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.908
Sweet! Let's get that kid!

12:24.744 --> 12:25.944
So, uh, who's the lucky lady

12:25.946 --> 12:27.879
Who's gonna receive your seed?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.215
See, you just put
your creepy little finger

12:30.217 --> 12:31.483
Right on the problem.

12:32.952 --> 12:35.253
I haven't exactly been
successful in love.

12:35.255 --> 12:39.290
It's like I'm running javascript
and women are running html5.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.428
Talking like that is part
of the problem, isn't it?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.696
Yeah.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.698
And it's weird, because
your package is perfect.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.703
And... And by "package,"
I don't mean your package,

12:51.705 --> 12:55.507
I mean your...
Package.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.244
Although, that is also
a showstopper.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.113
Okay, I can't believe that
this is not the first time

13:02.115 --> 13:05.016
I've said this, but stop
looking at my penis.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.587
Well, now that
you've mentioned it,

13:09.589 --> 13:12.590
I can't stop looking.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.659
It's like the elephant's trunk
in the room.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.630
Don't worry,
you'll-you'll find somebody.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.598
And, you know,
it goes without saying

13:20.600 --> 13:23.468
That if I could, I would
happily bear you a child.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.806
Okay, I wish all of this
had gone without saying.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.574
You doing okay?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.075
Yeah, I'm good.

13:31.077 --> 13:34.145
He wants to have a kid.
Now all he needs is a woman.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.214
Would you consider
a pregnant stripper?

13:36.949 --> 13:39.017
Uh, no.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.586
Well, that rules out
both my granddaughters.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.961
Morning. Did you
take your pills?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.529
Yep.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.865
Are you lying to me
or are you lying to yourself?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.200
(rattling)

13:56.302 --> 13:59.070
They're too big.
It's hard to swallow.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.539
If you say
"that's what she said,"

14:01.541 --> 14:03.141
I will kill you.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.475
You know what she said?

14:04.477 --> 14:06.778
"take your pills.
I care about you."

14:06.780 --> 14:08.179
Fine.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.448
Do you know how long
it takes to get a baby?

14:10.450 --> 14:13.685
Well, I know it takes, uh,
five months of mood swings

14:13.687 --> 14:16.821
And four months of not
wanting to be touched.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.791
And who knows what my ex-wife
was going through.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.059
I was just
researching surrogacy,

14:21.061 --> 14:23.127
And they say that once
you choose a great candidate,

14:23.129 --> 14:24.462
It can take
up to three years

14:24.464 --> 14:26.364
Before you have
a baby in your arm.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.999
I can't wait that long.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.235
I mean, who knows if I'll even
still want a kid by then?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.970
Tell me about it.

14:31.972 --> 14:35.173
Six months into jake's life,
I was like, "check, please!"

14:35.175 --> 14:37.075
I was kidding.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.910
As was I.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.647
Okay.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.916
I've narrowed down my options
to either adoption

14:44.918 --> 14:46.317
Or seeing if
brad and angelina

14:46.319 --> 14:48.486
Have an extra one
they could throw me.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.488
Uh, you know, if you really
want to adopt...

14:50.490 --> 14:53.591
For the last time, alan,
I am not adopting you!

14:53.593 --> 14:55.326
But, papa...

14:55.328 --> 14:57.495
Ah! All right.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.234
I already reached out
to a lawyer

15:03.236 --> 15:05.069
Who specializes in adoption.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.105
Well, you're a perfect
candidate to adopt.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.540
I mean, you're highly educated,
you're likeable,

15:09.542 --> 15:11.342
Uh, you have a stable
home environment...

15:11.344 --> 15:15.680
Financially secure,
no criminal record, handsome.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.384
I-I don't... I don't think
handsome really comes into play.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.020
Doesn't it, alan?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.955
No, I don't think so.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.592
Doesn't it?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.394
You're being ridiculous.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.929
Am I?

15:32.898 --> 15:35.300
I will steal you a baby.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.903
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

15:38.905 --> 15:41.239
So, as you can see,
finances are not an issue.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.807
I have a lot of
extra free time,

15:42.809 --> 15:45.977
And I know I can provide
a loving, nurturing home.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.713
You okay?

15:48.715 --> 15:51.649
Are you?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.685
Seriously, do I need
to call someone?

15:54.653 --> 15:55.920
Never mind.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.221
What's important is that

15:57.223 --> 15:58.890
I will coach the hell
out of the braves.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.258
Excuse me?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.226
It'll be the name of
my son's tee-ball team.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.895
Pretty pink ponies,
if it's a girl.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.964
You know what,
if my son wants to play

16:05.966 --> 16:08.132
For the pretty pink ponies,
then so be it.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.001
Tolerant.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.103
Well, mr. Schmidt,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.405
You are obviously
more than qualified.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.306
Thank you.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.474
That said, I'd start looking

16:16.476 --> 16:17.976
At golden retriever puppies,

16:17.978 --> 16:19.143
'cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.245
Well, I don't understand.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.814
You just said that
I'm more than qualified.

16:22.816 --> 16:23.815
And you are.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.283
But you're a single guy,

16:25.285 --> 16:27.352
And the system is really geared
towards married couples.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.153
That's racist.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.656
Uh, no, it's not.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.157
Then it's sexist.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.659
Nope.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.295
Well, it's some kind of "sist."

16:37.297 --> 16:39.297
Look, I'm not saying
it's impossible, okay?

16:39.299 --> 16:40.932
Just that it's difficult.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.534
You're in line behind families
that already have children,

16:43.536 --> 16:45.303
Married couples, single women...

16:45.305 --> 16:46.304
Anyone else?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.939
What, sweat shops? Circuses?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.307
The vienna boys' choir?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.542
Look, I wish
I had better news, okay?

16:51.544 --> 16:53.978
If you were married,
this would be a slam dunk.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.680
Okay, you don't get it.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.282
Marriage is not
an option for me.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.451
Okay, I understand
you're frustrated...

17:00.453 --> 17:02.487
No, what's frustrating
is that every woman I meet

17:02.489 --> 17:03.888
Runs screaming from me!

17:03.890 --> 17:04.889
I was married before
and she left me

17:04.891 --> 17:06.357
And I tried to commit suicide.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.859
Don't write that down.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.327
Why are you
writing that down?!

17:09.329 --> 17:10.328
No, no...

17:10.330 --> 17:11.796
Then I proposed
to two other women,

17:11.798 --> 17:13.164
And they both shot me down.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.532
I am incapable of maintaining

17:14.534 --> 17:16.367
A long-term relationship
with anybody.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.236
Now, give me a frickin' baby!

17:18.238 --> 17:19.504
Okay.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.671
I think we're done here.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.206
No, we are
not done here!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.342
I almost died wearing
a bedazzled jumpsuit

17:24.344 --> 17:25.710
And my life
needs meaning.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.412
Stop writing
things down!

17:33.919 --> 17:35.086
Mmm.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.754
Hey, how'd it go?
What kind of world...

17:36.756 --> 17:37.588
Uh-oh.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.190
...Are we living in

17:39.192 --> 17:41.993
Where any two high school kids
with a broken condom

17:41.995 --> 17:44.228
Can screw behind
an applebee's dumpster,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.064
Have a baby,
give it up for adoption,

17:46.066 --> 17:50.001
But not have it go to
an adult who is upstanding,

17:50.003 --> 17:53.237
Responsible,
and, might I add, handsome...

17:54.706 --> 17:56.674
...Simply because
every woman I meet

17:56.676 --> 17:58.242
Eventually grows to loathe me?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.944
And because of that,
the pretty pink ponies

17:59.946 --> 18:02.413
Will not have a tee-ball coach!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.115
So it didn't go well?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.616
(mocking):
No, it did not go well.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.686
All right, well, uh,
first things first.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.688
Uh, how about we get
you a little zin

18:10.690 --> 18:12.123
To calm your nerves?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.291
It's just not fair.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.392
I know, I know.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.893
Uh, thank you.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.229
Just because I'm single,
I'm not a fit parent?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.497
Did they say that to you?

18:20.466 --> 18:23.367
That's how I felt.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.435
Apparently, the whole system

18:24.437 --> 18:26.537
Is geared towards
married couples.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.106
And-and single guys
are not welcome.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.874
Like a studio city
swingers party.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.276
Exactly.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.278
Wait, what?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.380
Nothing. So, uh, did you
tell her everything?

18:36.382 --> 18:38.816
I mean, how you're successful,
you're warm, you're caring...

18:38.818 --> 18:40.485
I told her everything.
Did you give her the smile?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.286
Of course I gave
her the smile.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.122
She thought I was
having a stroke.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.424
So nothing worked?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.493
No. Even if I hadn't been
escorted out by security,

18:48.495 --> 18:50.795
I still don't think
they were giving me a kid.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.930
Wow, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.298
You know, it's ridiculous.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.268
Why-why are married people
automatically better parents?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.804
My mom was married six
times; didn't help her.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.440
See, and I would've been
a great dad.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.908
I would've played
catch with him,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.143
I would've read to him,

19:05.145 --> 19:06.777
I would've waited
till he went to sleep

19:06.779 --> 19:08.913
Before I smoked pot.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.449
Already got my mom beat.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.817
But-but you shouldn't give up.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.485
I mean, you might
still find somebody.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.820
No, I don't want
to marry somebody

19:15.822 --> 19:17.421
Just to marry somebody.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.956
It's got to be the right person.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.491
Ooh, or mila kunis.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.161
I get it.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.462
That's hard to find.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.097
(timer dings)
oh, that's my banana bread.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.632
I love your banana bread.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.633
I know.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.334
I made it hoping
we could celebrate,

19:30.336 --> 19:33.004
But it works on
a sad tummy, too.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.040
Oh, what would I do without you?

19:36.042 --> 19:38.409
I hope you never have
to find out. (chuckles)

19:40.512 --> 19:42.446
What?

19:42.448 --> 19:46.050
You are... Always there for me.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.785
Yeah, and-and you're always
there for me.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.220
We're best friends.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.625
What if we were
more than friends?

19:55.627 --> 19:59.063
Like...

19:59.065 --> 20:01.132
Super friends?

20:06.138 --> 20:07.505
Alan harper,

20:07.507 --> 20:09.106
Will you marry me?

20:13.345 --> 20:15.379
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:19.518 --> 20:23.421
Are you seriously
asking me to marry you?

20:26.592 --> 20:28.659
I can't believe
this is happening.

20:31.096 --> 20:35.166
And I always thought alan
would be the one on his knees.
