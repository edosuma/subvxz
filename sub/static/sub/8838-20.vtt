01:40.435 --> 01:43.730
PA! PA!

01:43.897 --> 01:46.691
PA! LOOK WHAT I FOUND!

01:46.858 --> 01:48.234
HEY, WHAT YOU GOT
THERE, DARLING?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.361
EGGS.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.197
OH, NO, HONEY.
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

01:52.363 --> 01:54.240
WILD BIRDS AREN'T
LIKE CHICKENS.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.075
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

01:56.242 --> 01:59.037
I'LL PUT THEM BACK.

01:59.204 --> 02:00.830
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO HATCH.

02:00.997 --> 02:02.499
THEY'LL BE TOO COLD
WITHOUT THEIR MAMA.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.584
ALL BECAUSE OF ME?

02:04.751 --> 02:06.002
HEY, DON'T FEEL
SO BAD.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.796
IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.882
I KNOW!
<i>I'LL</i> BE THEIR MAMA!

02:11.049 --> 02:12.550
WHAT?

02:12.717 --> 02:14.844
I CAN KEEP THEM WARM
UNDER MY PILLOW.

02:15.011 --> 02:16.179
THEN THEY'LL COME OUT.

02:16.346 --> 02:18.097
I'M AFRAID
THAT WON'T WORK.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.641
IT'LL WORK, PA.

02:19.808 --> 02:21.267
THEY NEVER SAW
THEIR REAL MAMA.

02:21.434 --> 02:22.936
I'M GOING TO GO
PUT THEM

02:23.102 --> 02:24.771
UNDER MY PILLOW
RIGHT NOW.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.282
SOMETIMES I THINK
I'M DREAMING.

02:36.449 --> 02:37.742
I MEAN,
JUST WHEN YOU THINK

02:37.909 --> 02:39.953
YOUR LIFE IS
TOTALLY PLANNED OUT,
SOMETHING HAPPENS,

02:40.119 --> 02:42.622
AND YOU FIND
YOURSELF COMPLETELY
UNPREPARED.

02:42.789 --> 02:45.041
I MEAN, I NEVER
EVEN EXPECTED
TO BE MARRIED.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.126
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.128
AS FAR AS CHILDREN
ARE CONCERNED,

02:49.295 --> 02:51.089
YOU HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE
THAN ANY OF US.

02:51.256 --> 02:53.508
OH, CAROLINE,
BY THE TIME
THEY COME TO ME,

02:53.675 --> 02:55.885
THEY'RE 5 YEARS OLD.
THEIR LIVES ARE
ALREADY FORMED.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.972
EVEN LUKE
WAS PRACTICALLY
A YOUNG MAN

02:59.138 --> 03:00.890
WHEN I MARRIED
HIS FATHER.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.976
HE WASN'T EXACTLY
IN NEED OF DIAPERS.

03:03.142 --> 03:06.813
SO, NOW YOU'RE
STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.189
OH, YEAH.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.859
DON'T WORRY.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.737
EVERYBODY'S SCARED
THEIR FIRST TIME.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.156
I KNOW I WAS.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.784
OH, CAROLINE,
WERE YOU REALLY?

03:19.951 --> 03:21.703
TERRIFIED...

03:21.870 --> 03:24.247
UNTIL THE MOMENT
ARRIVED.

03:24.414 --> 03:30.670
THEN IT WAS...
BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL.

03:30.837 --> 03:33.715
IN SOME WAYS,
I ENVY YOU,

03:33.882 --> 03:35.550
JUST STARTING OUT.

03:35.717 --> 03:37.886
OH, CAROLINE,
WE'RE PRACTICALLY
THE SAME AGE.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.804
OH, I KNOW,

03:39.971 --> 03:44.017
BUT MARY'S...
A YOUNG WOMAN, AND--

03:44.183 --> 03:45.768
IT'S LUCKY FOR ME
SHE IS.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.979
I'D LIKE TO WORK
RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE LAST MINUTE,

03:48.146 --> 03:49.689
BUT, WELL, IT'S NICE
TO KNOW I HAVE HER
TO RELY ON

03:49.856 --> 03:51.274
IN CASE I HAVE TO
STOP SOONER.

03:51.441 --> 03:53.484
I THINK
SHE'S MORE EXCITED
ABOUT TAKING OVER

03:53.651 --> 03:55.904
THAN YOU ARE ABOUT
THAT BABY OF YOURS.

03:56.988 --> 03:58.156
I WOULDN'T DOUBT IT.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.532
I THINK SHE'S
A LOT LESS NERVOUS

03:59.699 --> 04:00.658
ABOUT TEACHING
SCHOOL

04:00.825 --> 04:03.328
THAN I AM ABOUT
HAVING THIS BABY.

04:09.584 --> 04:10.418
CARRIE, LEAVE
THAT ALONE.

04:10.585 --> 04:11.502
I JUST FINISHED
THOSE.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.879
[CHUCKLES]

04:13.046 --> 04:14.422
MARY, HOW MANY
OF THESE PROBLEMS AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:14.589 --> 04:16.549
JUST THE FIRST 10.
MA, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THIS?

04:16.716 --> 04:18.051
Caroline:
SURE. WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

04:18.217 --> 04:19.886
Mary: PIN IT UP,
THE WAY YOU HAVE YOURS.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.221
IF I'M GONNA TEACH,
I SHOULD LOOK LESS LIKE
ONE OF THE STUDENTS.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.057
YOU'RE ALREADY
GROWING UP SO FAST,

04:24.223 --> 04:25.934
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF YOU.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.728
SHE REMINDS ME
OF A LOVELY YOUNG
GIRL I KNEW ONCE,

04:28.895 --> 04:30.897

CAROLINE QUINER.

04:31.064 --> 04:32.899
I WONDER WHAT EVER
DID HAPPEN TO HER.

04:33.066 --> 04:34.233
OH, DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

04:34.400 --> 04:35.902
SHE MARRIED
A HANDSOME YOUNG
PRINCE

04:36.069 --> 04:37.987
AND LIVED HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.

04:38.154 --> 04:40.406
HMM.

04:40.573 --> 04:43.034
CARRIE!

04:43.201 --> 04:44.619
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,
IF I'M A PRINCE,

THEN THIS MUST BE
ONE OF THE PRINCESSES

JUST ABOUT NOW.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.054
AFTER 5:00.

05:45.221 --> 05:46.639
WHY DIDN'T YOU
WAKE ME?

05:46.806 --> 05:48.057
BECAUSE YOU LOOKED
SO PRETTY

05:48.224 --> 05:50.018
ALL CURLED UP
LIKE A BABY.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.811
I BETTER
GET YOUR BREAKFAST.

05:51.978 --> 05:53.062
OH!

05:53.229 --> 05:54.647
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:54.814 --> 05:56.983
IT'S NOTHING.
JUST A DIZZY SPELL.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.528
DO YOU THINK
YOU OUGHT TO SEE
DR. BAKER?

06:00.695 --> 06:03.990
OH, CHARLES, IF I SAW
THE DOCTOR EVERY TIME
I HAD A TWINGE,

06:04.157 --> 06:06.117
THE POOR MAN WOULD
NEVER GET ANY SLEEP.

06:06.284 --> 06:07.577
YOU'RE SURE?

06:07.744 --> 06:09.704
YES,
AND YOU'D NEVER GET
ANY BREAKFAST, EITHER.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.039
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.708
YEP. A COUPLE EGGS
WILL DO FINE.

WRONG WITH ME.

JUST LET THE DOCTOR
DECIDE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

ISN'T IT?

09:13.012 --> 09:15.306
I'M GOING THROUGH
THE CHANGE.

RATHER YOUNG FOR THAT?

09:18.184 --> 09:19.936

09:20.102 --> 09:22.438
SO THAT'S
YOUR DIAGNOSIS, IS IT?

09:22.605 --> 09:23.981
YES.

09:24.148 --> 09:28.694
I GOT A LOT OF PATIENTS
WHO THINK THEY KNOW
MORE THAN I DO.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.322
NOW, I GUESS THEY COULD
SAVE A LOT OF MONEY

09:31.489 --> 09:34.408
BY FIGURING OUT
THEIR OWN AILMENTS.

45:24.515 --> 45:27.810
SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HER MA.

45:32.731 --> 45:34.274
HOW YOU FEELING?

45:34.441 --> 45:36.610
OHH.

45:36.777 --> 45:40.531
I FEEL WONDERFUL.

45:50.582 --> 45:52.376
CAROLINE INGALLS.

45:52.543 --> 45:56.004
HMM? WHAT?

45:57.381 --> 46:02.219
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT?
WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE,
YOU KNOW.

46:04.388 --> 46:07.224
HOW COULD WE
HAVE A PROBLEM?

46:07.391 --> 46:11.728
CHARLES,
JUST LOOK AT HER.

46:13.605 --> 46:15.065
BECAUSE
WE HAVE TO NAME HER,

46:15.232 --> 46:20.195
AND THE ONLY NAMES
YOU CHOSE WERE
GRAHAM AND NATHANIEL.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.752
AND I LOVE YOU.

46:39.423 --> 46:41.758
I LOVE YOU.

47:01.278 --> 47:03.405
Laura, voice-over:
WE DIDN'T LEARN
UNTIL YEARS LATER

47:03.572 --> 47:05.407
ABOUT ALL THE WORRY
MA WENT THROUGH,

47:05.574 --> 47:07.451
BUT IT WASN'T IMPORTANT,
SHE SAID,

47:07.618 --> 47:09.453
BECAUSE
WE WERE ALL BLESSED

47:09.620 --> 47:12.039
BY THE COMING
OF BABY GRACE.
