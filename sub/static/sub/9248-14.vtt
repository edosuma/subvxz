WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:05.179
James, it's so great
to finally meet you.

00:05.266 --> 00:06.789
You're all Victoria's been
talking about for weeks.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.878
Can you blame me?
He's just the sweetest thing.

00:08.965 --> 00:12.186
Allergic to green beans,
and ate 'em all up anyway.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.665
[chuckles]
I'll-I'll be fine.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.276
I think it's gonna
be more of a rash

00:15.363 --> 00:16.755
than a
throat-closing.

00:16.842 --> 00:20.324
Aw. We-we got plenty more
if you want seconds.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.805
How come he gets prime rib
and green beans?

00:22.892 --> 00:26.200
My first meal here was
cooked by Chef Boyardee.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.072
'Cause he's a lawyer
and you're a cop.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.378
So?

00:30.465 --> 00:32.162
So he's on
the right side of the law.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.077
The money side.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.123
VINCE:
A lawyer, huh?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.429
You good? Would I have
seen your face on
the side of a bus?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.910
I-I'm not really
that kind of lawyer.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.520
Keep at it.
You'll get there.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.523
Don't you go anywhere.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.569
You are right where
you need to be.
[chuckles]

00:47.656 --> 00:49.658
And so is my hand.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.094
So, uh, where'd
you find this guy?

00:51.181 --> 00:52.965
Oh, you're gonna
love this.
It's the old

00:53.053 --> 00:56.360
"boy meets girl, boy
convinces judge that girl

00:56.447 --> 00:59.537
was just holding pot
for someone else" story.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.975
Well, there's one
for the grandkids.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.499
Who knew that those words--

01:04.586 --> 01:05.761
"you have the right
to an attorney"--

01:05.848 --> 01:08.329
would change my life?

01:08.416 --> 01:09.547
Attorney.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.158
That's my
favorite part.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.594
Finally, somebody who'll help

01:12.681 --> 01:14.117
get us out of a ticket
for a change.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.859
You blocked in an ambulance.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.731
I saw the stiff
they were loading in.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.647
Me parking somewhere else
wasn't gonna bring him back.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.345
Hey, big guy,
why don't you see

01:24.432 --> 01:26.347
what's taking your wife
so long with that coffee?

01:26.434 --> 01:28.784
Well, I'm sure she's
brewing a fresh pot.

01:28.871 --> 01:32.918
Unlike the Styrofoam
cup of instant I got.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.312
This guy. The way your mom's
fawning all over him,

01:35.399 --> 01:37.140
you'd think he farts
Glen Campbell songs.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.490
Is the coffee
almost ready?

01:39.577 --> 01:40.970
Almost.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.015
Lawyer, successful,
charity work.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.496
Just 'cause he's
better than everybody else

01:45.583 --> 01:47.107
does not mean
he's better than everybody else.

01:47.194 --> 01:50.240
All right, don't get
yourself all worked up.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.720
He's gonna be gone and forgotten

01:51.807 --> 01:53.374
before you even
learn his last name.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
I don't know.
He seems pretty perfect.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.594
Yeah, and that's
his fatal flaw.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.596
What do you mean?Every couple of years,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.468
Victoria brings home
a great guy, nice,

02:00.555 --> 02:02.426
treats her right,
then she dumps him.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.124
The key is not to get attached.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.604
I don't know, she seems
to really like this one.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.128
Yeah, she also liked the fireman
that saved turtles and the

02:08.215 --> 02:11.305
pharmacist that
played the cello,

02:11.392 --> 02:12.654
who I thought
was perfect for her.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.569
Plus, he gave my mom
free Vicodin

02:14.656 --> 02:16.440
and I got free opera tickets.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.225
And the next thing you know,
she just cuts him loose.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.270
Right before La Bohème.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.098
Just remember,

02:22.185 --> 02:23.882
protect yourself.
Don't get too invested.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.971
You'll just end up getting hurt.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.409
So, are we still
serving him coffee?Yeah, sure. Just 'cause he's

02:28.496 --> 02:30.454
dead to us doesn't mean
we can't be polite.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.807
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:35.894 --> 02:38.723
♪ La,

02:38.810 --> 02:41.161

02:59.744 --> 03:02.791
So, Mike, how was dinner with
the new boyfriend last night?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.749
Is Victoria still
off the market?

03:04.836 --> 03:08.405
What do you care? You can't
afford to shop at that market.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.930
She don't take food stamps.[chuckles]

03:12.017 --> 03:14.716
Or your Visa.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.371
You're everywhere
she doesn't want to be.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.763
[both laugh]

03:18.850 --> 03:20.635
Uh, I don't...

03:20.722 --> 03:22.898
I don't think this fella stands
much of a chance, either.

03:22.985 --> 03:26.075
Apparently, she doesn't like
nice guys who treat her right.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.816
Well, that's to be expected.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.339
You know, you can't break
a wild palomino like Victoria

03:29.426 --> 03:31.167
with please
and thank-yous. Mm-mm.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.996
You got to use
the whips, spurs.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.303
Bring out the nasty stuff.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.740
Hey, that's my sister-in-law.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.872
I'm just saying:
good guys finish last.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.570
I mean, why do you think
I'm still single?

03:42.657 --> 03:45.050
Because women have caller ID?

03:45.137 --> 03:48.228
I'm sorry, is your pocket
full of numbers?

03:48.315 --> 03:49.272
Yeah, um...

03:49.359 --> 03:50.491
Better to have been blocked

03:50.578 --> 03:53.058
than never to have
called at all.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.973
See, I don't get what these
women see in these bad boys.Mm.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.063
I mean, every tattooed creep
we arrest has at least

03:58.150 --> 04:00.327
a couple of gals
writing to 'em in jail.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.111
How about that?
Guys doing 25 to life

04:02.198 --> 04:04.896
getting more tail than we do.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.637
Be careful
what you wish for.

04:06.724 --> 04:09.074
Some of that prison tail
may not be the kind we want.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.999
Try Googling "James,
lawyer, Victoria,

04:21.086 --> 04:24.655
boyfriend, allergic,
green beans."

04:27.223 --> 04:30.095
Mm. Still nothing.I don't know why you
guys are doing this.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.663
You're just setting yourself up
for disappointment.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.187
Try "James, Chicago,
lawyer, Victoria,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.973
boyfriend, allergic,
green beans."

04:38.060 --> 04:41.193
Parrish. His last
name is Parrish.Oh. James...

04:41.281 --> 04:43.413
Parrish. Here it is.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.067
Graduated Northwestern,
first in his class.

04:45.154 --> 04:48.331
Spends his summers
building houses in Guatemala.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.160
Yeah, yeah, good for him.
Does his family have money?

04:51.247 --> 04:52.857
Oh, says here

04:52.944 --> 04:55.077
his great-grandfather invented
the dustless vacuum bag.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.949
Hot dog, we're rich.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.866
Wh-What's a Rhodes scholar?

05:01.953 --> 05:04.086
He studied at Oxford?

05:04.173 --> 05:05.043
No, I don't want to...
I don't want to know.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.089
I don't want to care.

05:07.176 --> 05:10.614
Dead... to... me.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.529
Morning.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.183
JOYCE:
Hey, where were you?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.098
Out for a jog. Gonna run
a 10K with James next month.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.143
We're raising money for Ms.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.843
M.S.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.455
Molly, I know how it's spelled.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.111
Wow. First you quit pot,
now you're jogging.

05:29.198 --> 05:32.506
Wait, hold on. You quit pot?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.029
Cold turkey.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.641
I can't wait to finally
pet a police dog.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.556
Victoria, that's great.
I'm so proud of you.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.123
Thanks.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.212
Hardest part was breaking
the news to my dealer.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.910
He cried, threw things,
talked about having to downsize.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.956
It got real ugly.

05:48.043 --> 05:51.394
Can you believe this?
I've never seen her so happy.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.135
Okay, pooh-pooh
James all you want,

05:53.222 --> 05:56.399
but that man
is a good influence on her.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.575
Based on these
Facebook pictures,

05:58.662 --> 06:00.447
there might be
a bigger influence.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.013
Looks like he's got
a Pringles can

06:02.100 --> 06:03.232
in his bike shorts.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.539
Oh.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.935
Welcome to the family.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.810
VICTORIA:
Mol, can you come help me
with this dress?

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
Oh.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.640
Usually my zippers
are in the front

06:19.727 --> 06:21.032
and they don't go up so high.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.991
Very conservative.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.385
You gonna knock on doors
and spread the word?

06:25.472 --> 06:26.647
[giggles]No.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.649
I'm meeting James'
parents tonight

06:28.736 --> 06:31.565
and want to make
a good impression.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.741
You're meeting his parents?
You never meet parents.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.264
I know. But it's important
to James and...

06:35.351 --> 06:37.266
James is important to me.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.791
Wow. Really?

06:40.878 --> 06:42.489
Yeah.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.230
I've never really felt this way
about a guy before.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.408
[whispers]: Oh, God,
please don't toy with me.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.844
Mol, I'm not.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.062
All right.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.716
Okay, sit down.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.109
Look at me in the eye.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.198
Do you really
like this guy?

06:58.505 --> 06:59.680
I think I do.

06:59.767 --> 07:03.248
[gasping]: Oh-ho.
Oh, my God.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.641
I'm so happy.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.469
Oh, my God.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.776
You finally get a good one
and you actually like him.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.256
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this day?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.911
Since I brought home that
bass player when I was 15?

07:13.998 --> 07:15.913
Yes. Yes.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.655
Okay, now don't... Don't
scare him off. You know, don't

07:18.742 --> 07:21.179
rush into anything.Don't worry.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.094
My roll is slow.[laughs]

07:23.181 --> 07:24.661
I mean, but,

07:24.748 --> 07:26.707
you know, Mike and I,
we knew right away.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.013
Six months: engaged.
One year: married.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.798
[gasps] Can you imagine

07:30.885 --> 07:33.365
if this time next year
you're married? Oh![laughs]

07:33.453 --> 07:35.498
Not really.Oh.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.500
Think about all the
fun we can have.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.371
You know, like two old married
couples sitting around

07:39.459 --> 07:41.765
playing four-hand
rummy and, oh,

07:41.852 --> 07:43.201
camping trips,
oh, vacations.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.377
Oh! We can go to
wine tastings.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.032
And James and I can, you know,
talk about the wine and...

07:48.119 --> 07:50.644
and you and Mike can just guzzle
it down like French peasants.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.341
You need to slow yourroll.[laughs]

07:52.428 --> 07:54.343
[doorbell rings]Oh.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.040
Bet that's James. Okay,

07:56.127 --> 07:58.173
you continue getting
pretty, I'm gonna just...

07:58.260 --> 08:00.044
go keep him company.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.742
Not to jump ahead, but if you
get pregnant before me,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.352
just know that Mike
and I have got dibs on Chloe

08:03.439 --> 08:05.180
if it's a girl.
[laughs]

08:05.267 --> 08:05.354
Oh, this is exciting.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.187
James, this
basket, it...

08:12.274 --> 08:13.971
it's so considerate.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.233
It's just a little thank-you
for dinner the other night.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.629
Nice. Class move.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.718
Well, it's just about
the nicest thing

08:21.805 --> 08:23.372
anybody's ever
done for me.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.156
It's a fruit basket.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.594
I've been bringing fruit
into this house for two years.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.944
Big bag of apples every Sunday,
nobody says boo.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.730
[mouthing words]

08:33.817 --> 08:35.558
Two dollars' worth
of Granny Smiths.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.039
There's fruits in here
I don't even know how to open.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.649
Hey, James,

08:39.736 --> 08:40.476
you mind if I ask you
a legal question?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.434
Oh, here we go.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
Sure.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.612
See this scar?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.570
Now, I didn't fall
till I got home,

08:47.657 --> 08:48.963
but I was carrying
groceries

08:49.050 --> 08:50.617
from a big
chain store.

08:50.704 --> 08:51.922
You think
I got a case?Uh,

08:52.009 --> 08:53.750
well, I don't
have all the facts,

08:53.837 --> 08:56.100
but if anyone's liable,
it's the homeowner.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.406
Is that right?

09:00.365 --> 09:02.367
We'll talk later.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.850
If he's bothering you,
