00:17.949 --> 00:20.918
What rhymes with majority?
Nothing.

00:20.919 --> 00:23.987
Come on, you still working on that
funny song about the new Speaker?

00:23.988 --> 00:26.355
- Give it a break.
- Oh, priority.

00:26.356 --> 00:28.724
And authority.
Sorority.

00:28.725 --> 00:30.958
Oh, my God, there's a million
words that rhyme with it.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.260
Oh, no.
No, no, no! Gah!

00:33.261 --> 00:34.861
Look where Jonah's coming from.

00:34.862 --> 00:37.429
Oh, that grin, the keys.
Oh, God.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.064
He's been given
West Exec parking.

00:39.065 --> 00:41.666
Yeah, the holy grail
of parking.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.837
Good morning, gentlemen.
What a delightful day.

00:44.838 --> 00:47.373
I was gonna walk
to work, but then...

00:47.374 --> 00:50.444
- You got West Exec?
- It's just a parking spot, Dan.

00:50.445 --> 00:54.348
To be jealous of that, you'd
have to be a shallow kind of...

00:54.349 --> 00:57.385
I don't know, dick, I guess.

00:59.723 --> 01:01.924
( Sirens blaring )

01:01.925 --> 01:04.961
This is the situation room, ma'am,
during the hostage mission.

01:04.962 --> 01:07.598
- We need to approve a photo for release.
- Okay.

01:07.599 --> 01:09.967
Let's see.

01:09.968 --> 01:12.404
Oh, my God.
Look at Ben.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.306
Look at the size
of his coffee mug.

01:14.307 --> 01:17.510
Jeez, you could hide
a baby in that thing.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.212
Ooh, I look nice, though, huh?

01:19.213 --> 01:20.813
<i>Gary:
Yeah, you do.</i>

01:20.814 --> 01:22.615
You look concerned, but steely.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.818
- Yeah.
- Like a lady soldier.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.555
Oh, there are not
gonna be any veterans

01:27.556 --> 01:30.091
at this teen prayer breakfast
thing tomorrow, are there?

01:30.092 --> 01:31.893
No, ma'am.
No missing legs.

01:31.894 --> 01:34.096
Okay, here's all the details
of the youth leaders

01:34.097 --> 01:36.598
- that you're gonna be meeting.
- Oh, man.

01:36.599 --> 01:39.502
Who the hell is religious
as a teenager?

01:39.503 --> 01:41.504
I was.

01:41.505 --> 01:44.540
I mean, smoke some weed,
for Christ's sake, right?

01:44.541 --> 01:46.309
Oh, God, look at the president.

01:46.310 --> 01:48.712
- Jeez, he looks so...
- He looks jowly.

01:48.713 --> 01:50.714
Ah, look at those cheeks.

01:50.715 --> 01:54.118
It's like two little clutch
bags attached to his face.

01:54.119 --> 01:56.787
Oh, my God, with the bags.
It's always bags with you.

01:56.788 --> 01:58.522
Got to get out of the bag zone.

01:58.523 --> 02:00.825
Come on, Gary.

02:00.826 --> 02:02.827
- Sir.
- Gentlemen.

02:02.828 --> 02:05.129
Very excited about this new
demographics study you're planning.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.964
You should be.
Dream Metric will reveal

02:06.965 --> 02:08.499
the electoral battleground
as it truly is.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.866
It's comparable to the
invention of the microscope.

02:10.868 --> 02:13.337
Would it be okay if I showed you some
ideas I have regarding strategy?

02:13.338 --> 02:14.636
No time, Mr. Egan.

02:14.637 --> 02:16.470
They're mostly Flash based,
but I put them on YouTube.

02:16.471 --> 02:18.342
I just said I had no time.

02:18.343 --> 02:20.210
We're all being hit
by deadlines, right, Mike?

02:20.211 --> 02:22.712
Yes, sir. They can swing around
and smack you like a boom.

02:24.715 --> 02:26.517
You sail, Mike?
Have a boat?

02:26.518 --> 02:30.188
- Uh, yes, sir. An '87 Gulfstar 50.
- Great cruiser.

02:30.189 --> 02:32.023
Nothing fancy,
but she gets the job done.

02:32.024 --> 02:34.359
You know, like a cast-iron
skillet or Kevin Bacon.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.761
( Laughs )
I've got a Lagoon 380.

02:36.762 --> 02:37.896
<i>- Mike: Catamaran?
- Yeah.</i>

02:37.897 --> 02:39.531
That's real man's sailing.

02:39.532 --> 02:42.200
Leaning out in the tack, your big
man balls dipping in the salty sea.

02:42.201 --> 02:43.935
You're right there,
my friend, yeah.

02:43.936 --> 02:46.671
I have no children
and I wish for none,

02:46.672 --> 02:48.941
but she's my family.

02:48.942 --> 02:52.211
You know, I once went
powerboating on Lake Erie.

02:52.212 --> 02:53.912
Amazing rush.

02:53.913 --> 02:56.348
I need to go.

02:59.051 --> 03:02.186
You don't talk powerboating
to us sailors, Dan.

03:02.187 --> 03:03.788
What's the fucking difference?

03:06.125 --> 03:08.526
Hey. Veep in?

03:08.527 --> 03:11.864
<i>- No.
- Dan: You have time to just sit there?</i>

03:11.865 --> 03:14.900
You've already bugged the shit out
of everyone else in the building?

03:14.901 --> 03:17.369
I'm sorry, what?
Say that again.

03:17.370 --> 03:20.839
Jonah, out. Or else I'll see
if my pepper spray works.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.376
- Morning, guys.
- Morning.

03:24.478 --> 03:27.113
13,000.
No, 14,500.

03:27.114 --> 03:30.716
Is this the amount of times you've
admired yourself in the mirror today?

03:30.717 --> 03:32.551
No, I'm guessing that's
the difference in salary

03:32.552 --> 03:34.753
between this job and the one
that you just interviewed for.

03:34.754 --> 03:36.288
You think I had
a job interview?

03:36.289 --> 03:37.823
<i>I know you had a job interview.</i>

03:37.824 --> 03:40.492
- How, Sherlock?
- Simple makeup, higher neckline.

03:40.493 --> 03:43.195
Flats don't go with that dress, which means
you probably have heels in your bag.

03:43.196 --> 03:45.131
Coffee from corner bakery
implying you were at

03:45.132 --> 03:47.366
<i>one of the lobbying
shops on 18th.</i>

03:47.367 --> 03:48.434
I love this stuff.

03:48.435 --> 03:50.036
That and somebody
called your extension

03:50.037 --> 03:51.337
to make sure you had
the right address.

03:51.338 --> 03:53.506
- ( Scoffs )
- ( Phones ringing )

03:53.507 --> 03:56.309
Hey, is Danny Chung gonna be performing
tonight?

03:56.310 --> 03:57.944
Really?
What's he gonna be doing?

03:57.945 --> 04:00.113
I think he'll be pulling Bon
Jovi out of a burning tank

04:00.114 --> 04:02.082
in case we all forgot what
a fucking war hero he is.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.851
- Yeah.
- No, we have no official comment.

04:04.852 --> 04:06.420
No, that is not
a non-comment.

04:06.421 --> 04:08.155
- We're just not commenting.
- What?

04:08.156 --> 04:10.357
- How did this photo get out there?
- What?

04:10.358 --> 04:12.059
Can we delete it
off the Internet, then?

04:12.060 --> 04:14.161
No, I don't know
what I'm talking about.

04:14.162 --> 04:15.596
What?
What's going on here?

04:15.597 --> 04:17.964
Ma'am, the White House
released this picture.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.369
What? No, no.
This isn't...

04:21.370 --> 04:24.339
Amy, this isn't the photo
that we approved.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.141
- No.
- Look at this.

04:26.142 --> 04:29.078
It looks like I'm tweeting
when a guy loses his leg.

04:29.079 --> 04:30.846
Yeah, it does, ma'am.

04:30.847 --> 04:32.982
This is Kent's doing.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.485
He's trying to screw me.
I'm gonna go stab him.

04:35.486 --> 04:38.021
I'm stabbing him.

04:38.022 --> 04:40.857
- Yeah, from this point. It's unprec...
- All right, get out.

04:40.858 --> 04:42.993
Get out.
You, too, Amy.

04:42.994 --> 04:44.961
I don't want any witnesses in here.
I'm not kidding.

04:44.962 --> 04:47.530
- I'll start running the acid bath.
- Yeah.

04:47.531 --> 04:48.965
This is the photograph?

04:48.966 --> 04:51.534
No, just wondering if you think
this sweater goes with the dress.

04:51.535 --> 04:55.972
Look, the other photos
caught POTUS at a bad angle.

04:55.973 --> 04:59.008
- Vis-Ã -vis jowls.
- What?

04:59.009 --> 05:02.612
- It's a bad look.
- That's how he looks. That's his face.

05:02.613 --> 05:06.015
Why didn't you just take the
good one of me, Photoshop it in?

05:06.016 --> 05:09.452
I can't airbrush history, ma'am.
I'm not Joseph Stalin.

05:09.453 --> 05:10.686
No, that's true.
You're not.

05:10.687 --> 05:13.122
You don't have
a tenth of his charm.

05:13.123 --> 05:14.523
( Sighs )

05:14.524 --> 05:17.459
Okay, I'm just gonna go work
on my Jim Marwood song.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.596
Uh, we're in budget talks,
reaching across the aisle.

05:20.597 --> 05:22.732
POTUS does not want
the Speaker mocked.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.734
Oh, so now I have
to have Dan and Mike,

05:25.735 --> 05:28.704
Rodgers and Hammershit, come up
with a new song in an afternoon?

05:28.705 --> 05:30.205
We can laugh at ourselves.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.641
Maybe you should do a funny
bit about the photograph.

05:32.642 --> 05:35.744
- Own the situation.
- Own this.

05:35.745 --> 05:37.679
- She was multitasking.
- You need to get off the phone.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.916
It's a thing women can do, like
smelling nice and wrapping gifts.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.251
- Okay.
- Bye, Tom.

05:43.252 --> 05:45.186
Were you on top
of this or what?

05:45.187 --> 05:47.722
We were busy writing
youth culture references

05:47.723 --> 05:49.357
in a funny song
about the Speaker.

05:49.358 --> 05:52.225
( Mocking gibberish )

05:52.226 --> 05:54.094
I don't even know
what you just said.

05:54.095 --> 05:57.064
What are you laughing about,
Jolly Green Jizzface?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.532
- I was... sorry, ma'am.
- God damn, why are you even here?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.367
Oh, I came here to tell you
that you're a meme, ma'am.

06:01.368 --> 06:03.569
I'm a meme ma'am? What are you talking about?
Speak English, boy.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.705
A meme, an Internet phenomenon.

06:05.706 --> 06:10.277
Okay, yes. There are
Photoshopped versions of this

06:10.278 --> 06:12.079
springing up all over Twitter.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.047
- You at the Declaration of Independence...
- Oh, my God.

06:14.048 --> 06:16.550
With Mary Magdalene
at the crucifixion,

06:16.551 --> 06:18.686
the 2004 tsunami.

06:18.687 --> 06:20.922
If there was a tsunami, you'd be
genuinely looking at your phone

06:20.923 --> 06:22.156
'cause you'd be checking
the weather.

06:22.157 --> 06:24.625
You know what?
I don't need you to talk.

06:24.626 --> 06:26.494
How do we stop
this meme ma'am shit?

06:26.495 --> 06:28.796
No, it's just a meme, ma'am.
Not a meme ma'am.

06:28.797 --> 06:31.432
And usually they flame out
after about 48 hours,

06:31.433 --> 06:33.234
but sometimes they blow up
and become a super meme

06:33.235 --> 06:35.202
like Downfall or Gangnam.

06:35.203 --> 06:36.770
<i>- Gary: I love Gangnam.
- What did I just say?</i>

06:36.771 --> 06:39.139
Jonah: If it gets on Reddit
or Tumblr, that can happen.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.708
Yeah, okay.
You've got to get out of here, okay?

06:41.709 --> 06:44.211
Take all these meaningless syllables
with you and just get out.

06:44.212 --> 06:48.015
Yes, absolutely, ma'am.
Oh, and I will see you at the dinner tonight.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.717
Oh, my God, yeah.

06:49.718 --> 06:52.920
Okay, yeah, that's a cherry
on top of this whole turd cake.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.589
Ooh, your leg.
Could you put...?

06:54.590 --> 06:56.291
Fix your leg so I can
see your whole leg.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.660
Fix it. Yeah.
Okay.

06:58.661 --> 07:01.564
POTUS said that we can't do
the song about the Speaker

07:01.565 --> 07:03.166
at the Vic Allen dinner.
We can't do it.

07:03.167 --> 07:04.533
- The Speaker song is cut?
- Yeah.

07:04.534 --> 07:06.902
- It was hilarious.
- It was not that hilarious.

07:06.903 --> 07:10.139
You're out of your head, dude. That would
have made people piss in their pants.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.508
Hey, hey, hey!

07:12.509 --> 07:14.576
Let's do a new song about Kent.

07:14.577 --> 07:16.979
<i>- Kent?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:16.980 --> 07:20.016
- You think?
- Make fun of ourselves, that's what he said.

07:20.017 --> 07:22.084
I kind of like that.
( Laughs )

07:22.085 --> 07:23.987
I do, I kind of like that.

07:23.988 --> 07:26.122
All right, we'll do it.
I have no problem with that. Let's go.

07:26.123 --> 07:28.358
That's what we're gonna do.
Let's go.

07:29.427 --> 07:31.762
Just stop
the filibuster, buster.

07:31.763 --> 07:34.132
<i>- That's good.
- That's not a rhyme.</i>

07:34.133 --> 07:37.035
You're just matching a word
with the same word.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.037
Just write it down, Dan.
I'm in a zone.

07:39.038 --> 07:42.040
Comedy songs are the mark
of a douchebag.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.008
You're wrong.
You know why?

07:44.009 --> 07:46.611
Three words...
Weird Al Yankovic.

07:46.612 --> 07:48.846
Shit Al Yankoshit.

07:48.847 --> 07:50.481
You shut your mouth, okay?

07:50.482 --> 07:54.052
Just... protect the endangered
goose, Bruce.

07:54.053 --> 07:56.921
These are all great. A parody song
of "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."

07:56.922 --> 07:58.156
- Great idea.
- Really?

07:58.157 --> 07:59.623
- Yeah.
- If the first one bombs,

07:59.624 --> 08:01.225
people are gonna be
sitting out there thinking,

08:01.226 --> 08:03.460
"Shit the bed, we got
49 more of these to go."

08:03.461 --> 08:06.163
<i>Help the oil lobby, Bobby.
That's a good one.</i>

08:06.164 --> 08:08.198
Let's follow Jonah.

08:08.199 --> 08:10.734
That is so childish.

08:11.802 --> 08:13.736
Mike:
Why are we doing this?

08:13.737 --> 08:16.739
Because it's pointless, like
everything else that we do.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.275
You still pissed
you can't get in with Kent?

08:19.276 --> 08:21.477
Nobody can.
He's half robot, half robot.

08:21.478 --> 08:23.845
- He's a robot.
- Yeah, that's the challenge, Mike.

08:23.846 --> 08:25.714
See, in college
all the girls liked me.

08:25.715 --> 08:28.683
There was this one girl, smart,
who had no interest in me.

08:30.653 --> 08:32.486
She wasn't gay either.
I checked.

08:32.488 --> 08:34.489
So it became my mission
to sleep with her.

08:34.490 --> 08:36.191
And did you?

08:37.693 --> 08:39.427
No.

08:39.428 --> 08:42.496
And that failure has haunted
me to this very day.

08:42.498 --> 08:45.133
I have a similar story,
but the other way around.

08:45.134 --> 08:49.271
In college there was only one
girl that was interested in me.

08:49.272 --> 08:52.607
And it turns out
she was actually a lesbian.

08:57.112 --> 08:59.379
<i>Amy:
Everyone is a little off.</i>

08:59.380 --> 09:02.115
Dan is bored.
Sue is looking for another job.

09:02.116 --> 09:03.416
What? Really?

09:03.417 --> 09:06.853
Mmm, and the stuff
you're saying to Gary...

09:06.854 --> 09:09.790
What?
Gary's not happy with me?

09:09.791 --> 09:11.758
What?

09:11.759 --> 09:14.461
Because he'd be happy
if I shot him in the face.

09:14.462 --> 09:17.030
He would be.
I've actually thought about it.

09:17.031 --> 09:19.733
He feels since he got
that girlfriend Dana,

09:19.734 --> 09:21.067
<i>you've been weird with him.</i>

09:21.068 --> 09:23.070
Okay, can you please...
can you please not...

09:23.071 --> 09:25.272
See? That is another thing.
The leg.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.708
Well, he did lose a whole leg.

09:27.709 --> 09:30.644
That's like half of what
he should have, right?

09:30.645 --> 09:34.114
I'm fine. Look, I can
handle this whole thing.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.216
I can.
Sue.

09:36.217 --> 09:38.652
You are incredibly valued
here and I was wondering

09:38.653 --> 09:41.220
if there's anything we could do
to make you want to stay with us.

09:41.221 --> 09:43.289
- More money, ma'am.
- I'm on it. Welcome back.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.025
Honored to serve.

09:45.026 --> 09:47.428
Just bought Sue for a dollar.
Who's next?

09:47.429 --> 09:49.897
- Gary.
- I'll talk to Gary.

09:49.898 --> 09:52.533
How about doing that
outside of the office?

09:52.534 --> 09:54.136
Invite him to dinner maybe.

09:54.137 --> 09:58.140
Wow. I've never eaten
with Gary before.

09:58.141 --> 10:00.777
I've eaten next to him, but...

10:02.713 --> 10:04.414
Okay, yeah.
I can do that.

10:04.415 --> 10:07.317
- Good morning, Jonad.
- You're pathetic.

10:07.318 --> 10:08.581
Jonuts!

10:08.582 --> 10:10.944
Yeah, come at me when you guys
get an office, huh?

10:10.945 --> 10:13.557
- Everyone hates him.
- Yeah, but we hated him first.

10:13.558 --> 10:16.860
Oh, yeah, we hated him long before
it was even fashionable to hate him.

10:19.297 --> 10:21.165
Mike: This is like a
wildlife documentary.

10:21.166 --> 10:24.368
Jonah in his natural habitat.
He might defecate in a bush.

10:28.440 --> 10:31.141
- What is this?
- I don't know.

10:31.142 --> 10:32.576
- Jonah.
- Hey.

10:32.577 --> 10:33.944
- Busy?
- No.

10:33.945 --> 10:36.981
I just had to get
some of these binder clips.

10:36.982 --> 10:39.517
- Oh.
- From another building, huh?

10:39.518 --> 10:41.218
Yeah, we ran out
at the White House.

10:41.219 --> 10:43.154
Isn't there a guy, though,
that can get that for you?

10:43.155 --> 10:44.889
Yeah, you'd think
there would be.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.390
Yeah, but he's...
he's off sick.

10:46.391 --> 10:48.526
- Who is?
- Steve.

10:48.527 --> 10:50.227
What's poor old Steve
come down with?

10:50.228 --> 10:53.063
- He has diabetes.
- Oh, wow. That's a big one.

10:53.064 --> 10:55.366
- What type?
- Two.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.668
Yeah. What are the
symptoms of two again?

10:57.669 --> 11:00.037
Oh, he's just feeling bad.

11:00.038 --> 11:02.840
He's... you know,
he's sugary.

11:02.841 --> 11:05.209
- Yeah.
- Or he's not sugary enough.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.710
- Right.
- Yeah.

11:06.711 --> 11:09.013
Are there any other symptoms?

11:09.014 --> 11:11.916
Yeah, he's got fat wrists.
You know?

11:11.917 --> 11:15.019
Yeah. You getting
freezed out by Kent?

11:15.020 --> 11:16.854
We've been watching you, Jonah.

11:16.855 --> 11:18.389
You're obsolete.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.190
You're like an old VCR,
but with a bigger mouth.

11:20.191 --> 11:21.892
- You guys have been following me?
- Yeah.

11:21.893 --> 11:25.862
You've been following me like Nancy
Drew and his butt-sniffing dog

11:25.863 --> 11:27.964
and I'm the one
that has nothing to do?

11:27.965 --> 11:30.066
Cool the honey, bro.
We're very busy.

11:30.067 --> 11:33.403
- We're writing a comical song.
- Shut up, Mike.

11:33.404 --> 11:36.272
Well, I might have
nothing to do, gentlemen,

11:36.273 --> 11:38.841
but at least
when I'm crying about it,

11:38.842 --> 11:41.777
I am crying about it in my car

11:41.778 --> 11:44.747

that doesn't make sense.

13:05.531 --> 13:08.566
No, it certainly does not.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.035
You know Amy Brookheimer,
my chief of staff.

13:11.036 --> 13:12.603
Mr. Speaker.
It's nice to see you again.

13:12.604 --> 13:16.140
Amy. Now, am I getting older
or are you getting younger?

13:16.141 --> 13:18.576
We're both getting older.

13:18.577 --> 13:22.380
That's the third option, of course.
That's great stuff.

13:22.381 --> 13:25.683
I understand there's gonna be
a bit of a joke truce tonight.

13:25.684 --> 13:27.885
A cessation of hostilities.

13:27.886 --> 13:31.089
Absolutely.
There will be no jokes from me.

13:31.090 --> 13:34.359
I'm not going to mention
the photograph.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.495
Were you Internet shopping?

13:36.496 --> 13:38.264
( Laughs )
I'm joking.

13:38.265 --> 13:40.933
Or rather, I'm not.
There we are.

13:40.934 --> 13:42.201
Okay.

13:44.604 --> 13:46.772
You know, I was at
that same prayer breakfast

13:46.773 --> 13:48.707
- about a month or so ago.
- Oh, were you?

13:48.708 --> 13:50.409
- Aren't they great kids?
- They're great.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.811
And they seemed excited
as young voters

13:52.812 --> 13:55.980
about the possibility of
a veteran becoming president.

13:55.981 --> 13:58.750
- Not necessarily me.
- Okay.

13:58.751 --> 14:02.220
Well, they seemed very excited about the
possibility of a woman becoming president.

14:02.221 --> 14:05.322
Not necessarily you.
( Laughs )

14:05.323 --> 14:09.426
Well, my enhanced foreign
policy role will serve me well.

14:09.427 --> 14:11.662
Hey, it is good to be on top
of international relations.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.030
- Sure.
- So there are fewer opportunities

14:14.031 --> 14:16.066
for guys like me
to risk our lives.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.834
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely, yeah.

14:17.835 --> 14:20.703
- And limbs.
- Uh-huh.

14:20.704 --> 14:23.906
Are you not finishing this?
I'm gonna take it. Okay.

14:23.907 --> 14:27.443
Amy, you should
stop eating so much.

14:27.444 --> 14:30.212
What the fuck
are you talking about?

14:30.213 --> 14:32.314
You're stress eating.

14:32.315 --> 14:34.349
I'm not.
I'm having dessert.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.985
I think you're letting the pressures
of the office get to you.

14:36.986 --> 14:39.387
You barely have a life outside.
You don't go to the gym.

14:39.388 --> 14:41.256
You don't go to the movies.
You're barely at home.

14:41.257 --> 14:43.025
That's true.

14:43.026 --> 14:44.893
I mean, I hope
I don't have a cat

14:44.894 --> 14:47.062
because, believe me,
that poor fucker's dead.

14:47.063 --> 14:49.498
- ( Chuckles )
- You need to date, Amy.

14:49.499 --> 14:52.034
Find yourself a political
nerd who also showers.

14:52.035 --> 14:53.869
I'm just saying
I'm looking out for you.

14:53.870 --> 14:56.605
I wouldn't want you to become
a fat, neurotic freak.

14:56.606 --> 14:58.240
Speaking as a friend.

15:01.344 --> 15:04.012

15:08.117 --> 15:09.951
You saved four guys
from captivity.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.187
Yeah, and they weren't
burnt, by the way.

15:12.188 --> 15:14.389
Chung's guy had a face
like a Christmas ham.

- Thank you.

15:19.529 --> 15:22.197
All right, thank you.

15:22.198 --> 15:25.668
You know, this administration
has faced many challenges.

15:25.669 --> 15:29.772
But until now,
nobody's thrown down

15:29.773 --> 15:32.374
a beatbox challenge.

was it money or sex?"

15:57.703 --> 16:00.271
And he said,
"No, the guy from Fox News

16:00.272 --> 16:02.574
is the only one who stopped
and asked for directions."

16:02.575 --> 16:05.009

16:05.010 --> 16:06.444

16:06.445 --> 16:09.414
To be serious
for just a moment,

16:09.415 --> 16:13.118
I think we need to give
a big round of applause

16:13.119 --> 16:17.155
to the vice president
for the part that she played

16:17.156 --> 16:18.924
in setting free
those young guys

16:18.925 --> 16:22.093
who had been held against
their will for so long.

16:22.094 --> 16:23.862

thank you.

was unlock her bedroom door,

16:30.601 --> 16:33.069
- but thanks anyway.
- ( Laughter )

16:33.070 --> 16:35.338

look down her nose at 'em.

You know, when they're
looking for the thing.

16:37.475 --> 16:40.043
You know, but thank you.
Okay. Okay.

16:40.044 --> 16:41.911

for listening to me.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.281
<i>- Oh, can you imagine?
- Amy: You killed it.</i>

18:52.282 --> 18:53.849
You killed better
than Chung killed

18:53.850 --> 18:55.383
and he's actually killed.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.085
I had to pretend
not to like it to Kent

18:57.086 --> 18:59.287
while pretending to like it like
he was pretending to like it,

18:59.288 --> 19:02.891
but he didn't actually like it
and I actually really liked it.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.893
Oh, hello, sir.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.095
Ma'am, your song last
night made my lips curl.

19:08.096 --> 19:09.697
- Uh... ( laughs )
- Upwards.

19:09.698 --> 19:11.932
I have a small favor to ask.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.934
Okay, sure.
What can I do you for?

19:13.935 --> 19:16.937
Well, my Dream Metric demographic
program is about to launch

19:16.938 --> 19:20.206
and I would like to borrow a
member of your team for two weeks.

19:20.207 --> 19:21.941
Oh, you want Dan?

19:21.942 --> 19:23.409
No, I want Mike.

19:23.410 --> 19:26.412
Uh, no, you don't want me, sir.
You do want Dan.

19:26.413 --> 19:28.047
- He's great.
- I've got a big bounce coming on.

19:28.048 --> 19:29.515
I can feel it.
I'm like you.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.184
<i>Selina: No, uh-uh, you
can't take Mike.</i>

19:31.185 --> 19:33.085
He's my director
of communications.

19:33.086 --> 19:35.254
Are you kidding me?
You can't have him.

19:35.255 --> 19:39.391
POTUS's European visit,
the Helsinki agreement...

19:39.392 --> 19:41.961
- Yeah?
- He can no longer make it.

19:41.962 --> 19:45.131
Debt ceiling talks
are on the verge of collapse,

19:45.132 --> 19:47.066
so he needs someone
to go in his place.

19:47.067 --> 19:50.169
Now either that's
the Secretary of State or...

19:55.041 --> 19:58.110
Mike, on second thought,

19:58.111 --> 20:01.547
I think that
this whole Dream...

20:01.548 --> 20:02.948
- Metric.
- Metric.

20:02.949 --> 20:06.785
Dream Metric thing
sounds kind of fantastic.

20:06.786 --> 20:09.621
- Don't you think?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:09.622 --> 20:11.056
Comes from POTUS, so...

20:11.057 --> 20:13.024
I'll see you down the hallway
in 15 minutes, Mike.

20:13.025 --> 20:14.659
I'll pipe you aboard.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.795
Ma'am, enjoy your trip
to Europe.

20:16.796 --> 20:18.396
Thank you.

20:18.397 --> 20:21.032
Jonah will be making
the trip as well.

20:21.033 --> 20:24.002
Uh, wait.
What are you talking about?

20:24.003 --> 20:26.805
You're taking my director
of communications

20:26.806 --> 20:28.607
<i>and you're giving me Jonah?</i>

20:28.608 --> 20:30.675
This comes from POTUS.

20:32.278 --> 20:34.813
Ma'am. Ma'am, please
don't let him take me.

20:34.814 --> 20:36.348
I don't want to go
to numbers camp.

20:36.349 --> 20:38.450
- I can't help you. Just let go.
- Please. Please.

20:38.451 --> 20:40.151
Let go of me, all right?

20:40.152 --> 20:42.521
Obviously you made
an impression on Kent.

20:42.522 --> 20:44.122
I don't make
impressions, ma'am.

20:44.123 --> 20:47.025
I've literally lived with people
who insist I was never there.

20:47.026 --> 20:48.493
You give no press briefings.
Understood?

20:48.494 --> 20:51.129
I become Mike,
you become an ugly me.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.998
Cool.
I'll handle new media.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.901
Ma'am, I'm gonna get you
major online traction.

20:55.902 --> 20:57.503
Reddit, Tumblr, boom.

20:57.504 --> 21:00.740
Whatever. Just don't use my
bathroom on Air Force Two.

21:00.741 --> 21:02.641
<i>- There's another bathroom?
- Europe!</i>

21:02.642 --> 21:05.210
<i>- Oh, mon dieu.
- Yeah, I know. It's gonna be fun.</i>

21:05.211 --> 21:07.279
- Really, really fun.
- It'll be really fun.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.383
Now, I'm so sorry, but I don't think we're
gonna be able to do the dinner with Dana.

21:10.384 --> 21:13.853
Oh, we can bring it forward to lunch.
Let's do that.

21:13.854 --> 21:15.755
- Oh. Uh...
- Yeah? Yeah?

21:15.756 --> 21:18.691
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

21:21.929 --> 21:26.299
So cut to I'd set up a business
importing pecorino cheese.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.068
<i>Are you familiar
with that brand of cheese?</i>

21:28.069 --> 21:30.937
- Uh, I think...
- It's like parmesan, but it's different.

21:30.938 --> 21:34.341
- They're very different.
- What's the word that you use to describe...

21:34.342 --> 21:37.844
- A duskiness.
- A duskiness.

21:37.845 --> 21:41.380
Isn't that great?
Would you ever describe a cheese as dusky?

21:41.381 --> 21:44.316
Not in a million years, no.
I wouldn't do that.

21:44.317 --> 21:48.620
But so... so you import
parmesan?

21:48.621 --> 21:50.489
- Pecorino.
- I'm sorry, the pecorino.

21:50.490 --> 21:51.824
They're direct from Tuscany,

21:51.825 --> 21:54.192
so that means it comes in
through Florence.

21:54.193 --> 21:57.629
If I were to use a Sicilian
supplier, which I wouldn't,

21:57.630 --> 21:58.997
my overheads would double.

21:58.998 --> 22:00.766
And they would have
made her an offer

22:00.767 --> 22:02.534
that she couldn't refuse.

22:02.535 --> 22:05.236
Actually, the mafia involvement
in the dairy industry is minimal.

22:05.237 --> 22:07.038
You're right. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to be flippant.

22:07.039 --> 22:09.341
Think about it.
In "The Godfather," no cheese.

22:09.342 --> 22:12.077
- Yeah, you're right.
- You know I'm right.

22:12.078 --> 22:14.278
- Boom!
- That's her catchphrase.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.714
She got you.
You got to be so careful.

22:16.715 --> 22:18.849
Okay.

22:18.850 --> 22:21.318
- So, Gary.
- Yeah?

22:21.319 --> 22:25.422
This lunch is about me
saying that I value you.

22:25.423 --> 22:28.959
I cannot tell you, we are so
happy to hear you say that...

22:28.960 --> 22:31.528
- If you could just...
- Ahem.

22:31.529 --> 22:34.697
And I want to say thank you

22:34.698 --> 22:38.033
for all that you do for me.

22:38.034 --> 22:40.035
Aw, that's so nice.

22:40.036 --> 22:43.071
And I got you a little gift.

22:43.072 --> 22:45.340
- No!
- Yes, I did.

22:45.341 --> 22:47.509
Oh, that's so nice.

22:47.510 --> 22:51.179
Look at this.
A new Leviathan.

22:51.180 --> 22:55.416
A Lev...
a new Leviathan!

22:55.417 --> 22:56.985
Isn't that great?

22:56.986 --> 22:58.519
Does it have
the same layout, honey?

22:58.520 --> 23:00.554
<i>Because it took you so long
to learn the other one.</i>

23:00.555 --> 23:02.690
No, it's fine.
I can learn a new layout. It's fine.

23:02.691 --> 23:04.693
Do you wish that I had
gotten you a different kind?

23:04.694 --> 23:07.129
No, no, no, no.
I love it.

23:07.130 --> 23:11.968
♪ I love my new bag! ♪

23:11.969 --> 23:15.238
I can just sew some new pockets in.
That's okay.

23:15.239 --> 23:17.507
- 'Cause it's a symbol.
- Yeah.

23:17.508 --> 23:18.875
- It's for you.
- Mm-hmm.

23:18.876 --> 23:20.744
<i>- ( Phone vibrating )
- Is that for me?</i>

23:20.745 --> 23:23.046
Oh, yeah. That's for you.
It's Amy.

23:23.047 --> 23:24.414
Hey, what's up?

23:24.415 --> 23:27.417
The Kent song has suddenly
gotten some negative traction.

23:27.418 --> 23:29.552
- "References to Europe"...
- I'm putting you on speaker.

23:29.553 --> 23:32.322
"References to Europe
in an ill-conceived song

23:32.323 --> 23:35.157
performed by VP Selina Meyer
have sparked outrage

23:35.158 --> 23:37.126
- in parts of the continent."
- What's the problem?

23:37.127 --> 23:39.328
The lyrics
"don't be European, Ian,"

23:39.329 --> 23:41.463
"say screw France, Lance"...
that whole bit.

23:41.464 --> 23:43.498
I'm sending the alert links
to your iPad.

23:43.499 --> 23:46.768
Excuse me, Gary.
Can I have my iPad?

23:46.769 --> 23:48.270
- Do you have that?
- Oh, right here.

23:48.271 --> 23:50.171
- Here you go. Sorry.
- Thanks.

23:50.172 --> 23:53.142
You know, while you're getting
to know your own mind,

23:53.143 --> 23:55.044
I'm getting to know
the rest of you.

23:55.045 --> 23:57.012
- ( Laughs )
- And Mama likes.

23:57.013 --> 23:58.480
- Excuse me.
- Mama like it.

23:58.481 --> 24:00.616
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me, Gary, just for a second.

24:00.617 --> 24:03.119
I don't know what my password is.
Do you know what it...?

24:03.120 --> 24:06.022
- It's 4G. You don't need a Wi-Fi, ma'am.
- But the signals are all here.

24:06.023 --> 24:08.191
You know what you got to do
is shut the Wi-Fi off.

24:08.192 --> 24:10.360
That forces it into 4G.
You know I'm right.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.262
- Okay, let's not do that.
- I'm not sure how to do that.

24:12.263 --> 24:14.831
- No, no, no. That's confidential.
- I won't touch anything.

24:14.832 --> 24:17.767
I won't touch anything.
Oops, I just started a war with Iran.

24:17.768 --> 24:19.969
- Joke.
- That's not even remotely funny.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.538
That's just one
of my classic jokes.

24:22.539 --> 24:25.675
- Calamari and zucchini?
- Oh, that would be for Gary here.

24:25.676 --> 24:28.011
- Okay, here you go.
- And maybe some olives?

24:28.012 --> 24:30.747
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- Get out!

24:30.748 --> 24:32.415
Oh, God.

24:32.416 --> 24:34.251
Well, our European visit

24:34.252 --> 24:36.720
just got turned into a one-way
trip to hell and back.

24:36.721 --> 24:38.889
- That's actually a return.
- You know what?

24:38.890 --> 24:41.892
Could you just shut it
just for like two seconds?

24:41.893 --> 24:44.628
- Why don't we go?
- Yeah, we've got to cut this lunch short.

24:44.629 --> 24:47.832
But, you know, you're gonna have
your bag forever, so what the fuck?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.702
<i>Kent:
Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

24:51.703 --> 24:54.304
Dream Metric begins
at this second.

24:54.305 --> 24:56.406
Today is ground zero.
Mike.

24:56.407 --> 24:59.175
Right.

24:59.176 --> 25:01.745
This is the index to America.

25:01.746 --> 25:04.014
It will let us know
how people will vote

25:04.015 --> 25:06.249
before they even
know themselves.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.919
This program revolutionizes
the way we think

25:08.920 --> 25:10.654
about the way we think.
Mike.

25:10.655 --> 25:12.923
It's exciting.

25:16.227 --> 25:18.361
"Within the last hour,
the German chancellor

25:18.362 --> 25:21.364
expressed his disappointment
at the remarks."

25:21.365 --> 25:23.567
Who the hell
does he think he is?

25:23.568 --> 25:26.269
"'George Dennis' of 'Le Monde'

25:26.270 --> 25:29.205
called the vice president
a typical American hick."

25:29.206 --> 25:30.507
I think it's pronounced
Georges Denis.

25:30.508 --> 25:33.743
I'm not a hick.
Screw you, Depardieu.

25:33.744 --> 25:35.378
I think it just got
on Reddit and Tumblr

25:35.379 --> 25:37.213
and just exploded from there.

25:38.649 --> 25:42.586
Uh, those words
sound mighty familiar.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.091
Jonah?

25:48.794 --> 25:50.428
I just liked the song so much.

25:50.429 --> 25:52.230
And I thought
you wanted it out there,

25:52.231 --> 25:55.066
so I just put it out there.

25:57.169 --> 25:59.503
Get off the plane.

25:59.504 --> 26:01.239
What?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.908
- Get off of the plane.
- Ma'am, we're taxiing.

26:03.909 --> 26:06.544
I don't give a shit.
Get the fuck off my plane.

26:06.545 --> 26:09.246
Yeah, get the fuck
off of my plane.

26:09.247 --> 26:13.084
I cannot believe that you
put that out on Tumble.

26:13.085 --> 26:14.919
- No, Tumblr.
- Okay.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.123
- Stop the engines!
- Can we get Jonah off the plane, please?

26:18.124 --> 26:19.858
Get up.

26:19.859 --> 26:21.560
All of your privileges
are gonna be removed.

26:21.561 --> 26:23.862
- Okay, but not the parking.
- Yeah, the parking.

26:23.863 --> 26:26.264
- Wait, what? You have parking?
- Not anymore.

26:26.265 --> 26:28.800
- Yeah, not anymore.
- But I didn't even own a car.

26:28.801 --> 26:31.036
I just had to sign a two-year
lease for the Nissan Cube.

26:31.037 --> 26:33.806
- Get him off.
- Okay, guys, my bag is in the hold.

26:33.807 --> 26:36.043
- Does he have a big bag?
- Gary.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.479
- Okay.
- Better?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.381
- It's all good.
- It's all good.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.450
- I'm fine.
- Totally fine.

26:43.451 --> 26:45.185
Great.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.161
How long is this flight?

26:59.334 --> 27:01.335
Numbers, they never
end, do they?

27:01.336 --> 27:02.936
But that's what's
good about them...

27:02.937 --> 27:05.405
they keep going.

27:08.142 --> 27:09.676

27:09.677 --> 27:12.411

Yeah, make sure
he goes through with it.
