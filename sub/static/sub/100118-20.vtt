WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:04.395
Previously onDynasty...Mia? Of all the bars in Atlanta,

00:04.439 --> 00:05.962
you walk into mine.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.616
I like secretlydating a doctor.

00:07.659 --> 00:08.617
My company's in trouble.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.140
Our marriage is in trouble.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
Carrington Atlantic oil tankers

00:11.881 --> 00:13.970
are being held up
in Moldavian shipping lanes.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.015
We're actually flying
to Moldavia

00:15.058 --> 00:16.973
to try and rescue
Blake and Anders

00:17.017 --> 00:18.801
from kidnappers without
getting ourselves killed.

00:18.844 --> 00:21.195
You were right.
I just rescued Blake

00:21.238 --> 00:22.979
and Liam from prison.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
What did he just say?

00:27.027 --> 00:30.639
So, I asked Liam, if his
father was in mortal danger

00:30.682 --> 00:32.728
and in a Moldavian prison,
wouldn't he want to know?

00:32.771 --> 00:35.252
And then he reminded me that
his father is dead and also had

00:35.296 --> 00:37.254
an affair and a child
with his son's girlfriend,

00:37.298 --> 00:39.430
so probably not, which
really wasn't the point.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.041
No, the point is that neitherof our fathers died,

00:41.084 --> 00:42.607
so I don't knowwhy you're upset.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.522
I'm upset because Liam kept
this kidnapping from me

00:44.566 --> 00:46.133
because he said I
would've gone overboard

00:46.176 --> 00:47.656
and made everything
worse, which means

00:47.699 --> 00:50.398
he doesn't trust me to be
an adult or responsible.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.661
Well, I'm glad no one told me,because I would've been a wreck.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.402
Yes, you would have folded
like a cheap accordion
under pressure.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.925
Luckily, I've been dealing
with things like this

00:55.968 --> 00:57.187
since I was wearing
monogrammed onesies.

00:57.231 --> 01:00.103
Still, the guys saved themat the end of the day.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.757
Why are you still defending him?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.759
Do they not have girl code
in Australia?

01:03.802 --> 01:05.935
Luckily, I've got
it all figured out.

01:05.978 --> 01:09.112
My lawyers have been working
on a little prenup.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.114
You know, rules
for our marriage.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.160
Mostly for Liam.
Like, to be true partners

01:13.203 --> 01:16.946
and to not keep secrets and totreat me as a responsible adult

01:16.989 --> 01:18.730
in all matters of importance.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.124
Right, so it's a contract?
That should go down well.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.126
You know what, Kirby?
I am starting to feel

01:23.170 --> 01:24.388
a little bit attacked right now,

01:24.432 --> 01:26.303
so I am gonna ban
any more Liam talk

01:26.347 --> 01:28.131
until after
our retail therapy day.

01:28.175 --> 01:31.787
Right, um, hang on,
I forgot my sunglasses.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.267
I'll meet you outside.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.184
No!DISTORTED VOICE:
Don't say a word.

01:37.227 --> 01:40.752
Yes, I saw the flowers.
They're beautiful, thank you.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.232
Well, when I get back,
I can show you

01:42.276 --> 01:44.147
some even steamier moves.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.977
What did I miss duringmy two days in Moldavia?

01:48.020 --> 01:50.153
Has anyone ever told you you'refreakishly good at lurking?

01:50.197 --> 01:52.329
So you're seeing someone now?

01:52.373 --> 01:54.070
Yes, but please don't pressure
me into talking about it.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.680
It's still early.

01:55.724 --> 01:59.119
Of course. You'll tell me
when you're ready.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.077
There comes a stage
in every father's life

02:01.121 --> 02:03.166
where he has to learn
to trust and respect

02:03.210 --> 02:05.299
his daughter's decisions
about her love life.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.129
Well,

02:09.172 --> 02:11.566
good chat, but I have
a flight to catch.What?

02:11.609 --> 02:14.351
Where are you going?Trust and respect. Remember?

02:16.397 --> 02:19.530
Carrington Atlantic
was right in my hands,

02:19.574 --> 02:22.185
and somehow Blake managed
to snatch it away.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.926
I probably should'veleft him in Moldavia.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.189
The rescue confirmedwhat I knew all along about him.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
He is a cruel,
heartless monster.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.585
That's exactly how I described
him in my divorce filings.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.282
Well, you were right,as usual,

02:32.326 --> 02:35.285
which is why I am prepared
to continue this battle.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.113
As thrilling as your loyalty is,

02:37.157 --> 02:39.550
I'm not sure we have
any moves left in this war.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.899
:Uh-uh-uh.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.727
I do have some good news.

02:42.771 --> 02:45.426
Guess who Blake just named
as second-in-command at C.A.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.516
Yeah. This guy.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.735
You really buried the lede.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.477
Now, I don't think we can
take C.A. away from him.

02:53.521 --> 02:57.220
Though with my very
clever son on the inside,

02:57.264 --> 03:01.355
maybe we can destroy it and
crush Blake in the process.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.791
You still have connections

03:02.834 --> 03:04.227
at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
right?

03:06.186 --> 03:09.624
You're not getting away
with this. I will kill you.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.016
Oh, come on.It's the perfect way

03:11.060 --> 03:12.322
to start a bachelorette party.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.368
It gets yourheart rate pumping.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.978
Hi, Fallon.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.589
What is my assistant doing here,or am I still hallucinating

03:18.633 --> 03:21.070
from the polyester bag
that was over my face?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.854
I invited Allison
as a babysitter.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.204
I prefer "chaperone."

03:24.247 --> 03:25.379
SAM:Someone needsto make sure we don't,

03:25.422 --> 03:27.294
you know, shave our heads.What is this?

03:27.337 --> 03:29.252
Is there anyone
you didn't invite?

03:29.296 --> 03:31.036
I mean, are Liam's exes
about to show up?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.256
Okay, I ran into
Cristal at the hotel,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.432
and she was eating
there all by herself,

03:35.476 --> 03:38.435
and, well, I've never
seen anyone chew so sadly.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.655
But she lied to me
just as much as Liam did.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.179
Don't worry,
I will stay out of your way.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.269
I just need a getaway
from my life and to let loose.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.749
FALLON:
Oh, wow.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.054
This is off to a great start.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.142
BLAKE:
It's my third marriage.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.361
I get it.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.971
Cristal just needs
some peaceful time away

03:53.015 --> 03:55.365
to realize that she doesn't
really want to leave.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.541
Until then, I can focus
on Carrington Atlantic.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.977
As long as you're okay.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.283
I'm great.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.243
The tankers are en route
to our refinery,

04:03.286 --> 04:06.028
and I'm kick-starting the new
C.A. with a press conference

04:06.071 --> 04:08.030
announcing that Blake Carrington

04:08.073 --> 04:09.510
is CEO again.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.207
I think you should be
right there by my side.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.600
I would love nothing more.

04:12.643 --> 04:13.818
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.298
I'm sure it's bad,

04:15.342 --> 04:16.821
since you never interrupt
with good news.

04:16.865 --> 04:19.259
Well, good news can wait.Bad news needs to be dealt with.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.738
Mm-hmm.In this case,

04:20.782 --> 04:23.437
the press got wind that
you've stolen oil

04:23.480 --> 04:25.308
from the small nationof Moldavia.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.745
Now the Department of Energyhas launched an investigation

04:27.789 --> 04:30.531
into C.A. for possiblemisconduct.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.402
This is ridiculous.
I didn't steal anything.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.404
It's not my fault
that Laura Van Kirk set me up.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.406
Yeah, just because the king
decided to nationalize oil

04:36.450 --> 04:39.104
doesn't mean they can take whatour company's already paid for.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.368
Well, unfortunately,
until the Energy Department

04:41.411 --> 04:44.588
officially agrees with yourassessment, all C.A. operations

04:44.632 --> 04:47.025
have been frozen.

04:47.069 --> 04:50.028
How the hell did the press
even find out about this?

04:50.072 --> 04:52.379
Perhaps we should cancelthe press conference.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.250
No. No, we can't look
like we're panicking.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.426
So what are we doing?Panicking.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.820
Turning to friends in
high places who can help kill

04:58.863 --> 05:01.344
this investigation.

05:01.388 --> 05:05.217
SAM:
Welcome to Fallon's
bachelorette HQ.

05:05.261 --> 05:08.743
We have views,
24-hour butler service,

05:08.786 --> 05:10.266
an on-call masseuse

05:10.310 --> 05:13.356
and, for a true New Orleans
experience,

05:13.400 --> 05:15.663
Mistress Delphine,

05:15.706 --> 05:17.665
maker of magic,
creator of potions.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.536
Oh, so she's a bartender.Mm-hmm.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.321
All right, well, that's
good, because I still have

05:21.364 --> 05:23.497
a giant, Liam-sized
headache to erase.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.455
I'll have whatever she's having.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.978
If I'm gonna go crazy,
I'm gonna need

05:27.022 --> 05:28.371
a little more
than my usual Chardonnay.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.982
Okay, well, make
mine extra strong,

05:31.026 --> 05:32.419
'cause I'm feeling myself
after saving lives

05:32.462 --> 05:34.769
and Sammy Ho
is going out tonight.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.379
Uh, can you make mine a triple?

05:36.423 --> 05:37.772
I'll take one of those, too.SAM: What?

05:37.815 --> 05:39.382
No. You're chaperoning.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.470
♪ Yeah

05:40.514 --> 05:41.515
Thank you.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.386
Oh, oh, before
we drink,

05:43.430 --> 05:45.170
a couple ground rules, okay?

05:45.214 --> 05:47.390
No tacky strip clubs,no tacky blow-up dolls,

05:47.434 --> 05:49.523
no ugly bachelorette sashes--oh, and no photos,

05:49.566 --> 05:51.525
in case they turn outtacky and ugly.

05:51.568 --> 05:56.051
Other than that, here is to
an untacky night to remember.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.413
Snake on the floor!
Snake on the floo...

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
What the hell?

06:15.853 --> 06:16.985
What happened to your face?

06:22.512 --> 06:24.340
And whose clothes are these?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.516
Where did you get
that diamond necklace?

06:33.218 --> 06:34.437
WOMAN :
Hello?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
Hello?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.354
Okay, who stole
my engagement ring?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.095
What the hell
happened last night?

06:43.011 --> 06:44.491
Oh.

06:44.534 --> 06:48.756
Well, apparently, I got married.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.975
And I'm assuming
it wasn't to Liam.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.394
What the hell are we gonna do?
This is not good.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.180
No. No, um,
it's actually pretty bad.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.748
At least Britney Spears knew
who she was marrying in Vegas.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.403
Remind me not to invite you
to my next bachelorette party.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.189
I feel like there's a heart
beating inside of my head,

07:31.233 --> 07:34.758
and your screaming
is giving it a heart attack.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.065
Oh, your head hurts?Yeah.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.545
My screaming's making it worse?

07:38.588 --> 07:39.807
You want to take a nap? No!

07:39.850 --> 07:41.069
Ow!

07:41.112 --> 07:43.593
We can piece this
together, okay?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.682
What was the first thing
we were supposed to do?

07:45.726 --> 07:47.902
I think we had reservations
for Antoine's.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.904
I don't even remember eating
last night.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.775
Me, neither.

07:51.819 --> 07:55.083
Everything is a blurafter those drinks we had here.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.650
I just need to get my phone.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.434
I have the whole itinerary
on there.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.480
Can someone call it?
And-and please,

08:00.523 --> 08:02.569
can you stop breathing so loud?

08:05.397 --> 08:07.487
I don't know where mine is.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.445
None of us have our phones.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.231
I can't find my purse.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.450
Or my wallet.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.539
Okay, this is the part

08:16.583 --> 08:19.107
where you guys tell me this
is all some kind of, you know,

08:19.150 --> 08:22.458
sick psychological joke to seehow I react under pressure.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.547
Tell me there's a safe word.
There's a safe word, right?

08:24.591 --> 08:25.896
Wait, I think I found something.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.158
Oh, my God.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.551
I told you, no sashes.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.380
Yeah, but this one has the name
of a bar on it.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.556
Maybe we went there?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385
Oh, Mr. Colby's back.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.169
Wonderful. I have something
important to tell him.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.476
Wait, Mrs. Colby, I thinkhe's in the middle of something.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.782
Jeff, I...

08:43.653 --> 08:46.047
Not even a sock on the door
as a warning?

08:46.090 --> 08:48.615
Alexis, just give usa minute, all right?

08:55.796 --> 08:57.014
I'm meeting her tonight.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.581
Hopefully this bringsa swift end

08:58.625 --> 09:00.757
to the investigationand we can get back to business.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.716
In the meantime,
I need a profile of Adam,

09:02.759 --> 09:04.456
for the press conference.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.633
You know, stories that show
he's a good leader

09:06.676 --> 09:07.764
while still humanizing him.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.897
I'm talking gold medalin trout fishing,

09:09.940 --> 09:12.943
captain of the bison team,whatever kids do in Montana.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.554
Well, I'm sure
that's exactly what they do,

09:14.597 --> 09:16.599
but I'll double-check.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.559
I've been thinking about yourplan to kill the investigation,

09:19.602 --> 09:21.082
and as your
right-hand man,

09:21.125 --> 09:22.474
I have concerns.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.824
Do you even know
what the plan is?

09:23.867 --> 09:27.088
I assume it involves
blackmail and/or bribery.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.611
Carrington 101.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.091
Well, now,
that's Carrington 102.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.702
Carrington 101 is getting
important people

09:32.746 --> 09:34.617
to owe you favors, specificallyfor times like these.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401
Now it's timeto call one in.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.881
Right, but what if you're caught

09:37.925 --> 09:39.230
meeting with this person?

09:39.274 --> 09:41.232
Or what if it's a trap? I'd...

09:41.276 --> 09:43.844
I'd just feel more comfortable
if someone else went, like me.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.847
Well, I appreciate the offer,but this calls for the big dog.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.892
She trusts me.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.851
We're meeting in an abandoned
office building later.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.417
It's gonna be fine.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.810
I've known her for years.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.683
Okay. Let's have a nip
of whiskey then

09:56.726 --> 09:57.988
to celebrate
our impending success.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.468
Now, there's a good idea.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.513
Mm-hmm.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.524
Cheers.Cheers.

10:12.568 --> 10:16.833
The point is, all we have
to go on is this hideous sash.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.618
Apologies if your sister
designed it.

10:18.661 --> 10:21.446
But I was hoping you couldtell us anything you remember

10:21.490 --> 10:23.231
from last night?Wait, you're serious?

10:23.274 --> 10:25.189
Like, you don't remember
the mechanical bull riding?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.931
Oh. Is that why my thighs
are killing me?

10:27.975 --> 10:29.933
Gotta say,
I'm a little relieved.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.543
The last thingany of us remember

10:31.587 --> 10:32.980
is having drinksat our suite.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.722
Yes, yes.
Made by this freaky...

10:35.765 --> 10:38.550
like, hipster voodoo woman
wearing a Halloween costume,

10:38.594 --> 10:40.074
Mistress something?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.858
Mistress Delphine. Hmm.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.861
Yeah, she's, uh, she's famous
for her secret herbal blends.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.428
Which basically act

10:46.471 --> 10:47.908
like roofies.Wow.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.518
Nice background check.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.868
Okay. At least we know who has
our phones and our wallets.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.217
Actually, I...

10:53.261 --> 10:55.089
have one of your phones.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.307
That's mine!

10:56.351 --> 10:57.744
Wait, why do you have
yourphone?

10:57.787 --> 10:59.571
'Cause this thing's
practically glued to my hand.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.357
Even Mistress Delphine's
magic couldn't touch it.But you left it here.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.751
Well, no phones allowed
while riding Sophie.Okay,

11:04.794 --> 11:06.578
there's no photos
because of your rules,

11:06.622 --> 11:08.015
but it looks like
we took a Lyft

11:08.058 --> 11:10.365
to a place called
Monsieur Reynaud's.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.889
I didn't mean for you to
find out about Mia like that.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.892
But since the cat's
out of the bag, um...

11:15.936 --> 11:17.720
I want a divorce.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.243
Wow.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.245
Thanks for being so delicate.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.944
I'm sorry, but we need to
face the facts, Alexis.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.162
Our revenge failed.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.729
We lost C.A.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.775
Game over.That's what I cameto tell you.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.255
There is still a way to getwhat we each want.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.648
I have a new plan.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.997
Don't you ever
run out of plans?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.172
No.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.480
Look, when I first
saw you in Europe

11:38.523 --> 11:40.482
and we reconnected,
I thought I was dying.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.093
So focusing on
revenge made sense.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.705
But I have a new liver
and a new lease on life.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.229
I just want to move on,
you know?

11:48.272 --> 11:50.492
Maybe settle down and...

11:50.535 --> 11:52.668
I really like Mia.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.756
Mm-hmm.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.236
We had a deal.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.239
One year of wedded bliss
in exchange for my testimony

11:58.282 --> 12:01.938
against Blake.Yeah, testimony that turned outto be worthless.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.157
Look, I promise,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.725
I will give you
a very generous settlement

12:05.768 --> 12:07.770
for terminating our deal early.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.859
Okay?
FALLON:
What possessed us

12:09.903 --> 12:12.688
to come into this dump
in the middle of the night?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.124
Oh, hi.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.735
I'm sor...
Fallon Carrington.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.040
I love
your store.
Mm.

12:17.084 --> 12:20.174
Do you happen to remember
us from last night?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.871
You're a hard group to forget.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.004
Except, where's the fourth one?

12:24.047 --> 12:27.050
She's... she's outside
trying not to hurl.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.791
Speaking of
last night,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.054
when we came in here,
was there a man with us?

12:31.098 --> 12:34.101
Um, probably very handsome.
Husband material.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.885
No, but you talked
about a wedding

12:35.929 --> 12:37.626
to someone named Scorpio.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.150
Scorpio?

12:40.194 --> 12:43.110
I married a man with anastrological sign for a name.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.981
Let me show you
the surveillance footage.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.591
Maybe that'll help.Yes!
Yes!

12:46.635 --> 12:47.984
Oh, God.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.203
Who keeps calling me?

12:50.378 --> 12:51.640
"Unknown number."

12:51.683 --> 12:52.989
Decline.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.734
SAM :
Oh, my God!

12:58.778 --> 13:00.518
So...Fallon.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.825
I love it!
Oh.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.392
Well, that shirt is...

13:04.435 --> 13:06.481
Can we delete this
after we're done?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.224
How much did I spend?

13:10.267 --> 13:11.399
SAM:Wait, I don't know if I want...

13:11.442 --> 13:13.140
Do you have your wallet?No.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.055
Sir, can we pay for it tomorrow?Can we come back tomorrow?

13:15.098 --> 13:16.665
No, no, no.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.493
Hey!

13:18.536 --> 13:19.929
Hey!

13:21.801 --> 13:22.889
Um...

13:22.932 --> 13:24.064
did we...

13:24.107 --> 13:26.022
Rob my store last night?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.241
Yeah.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.416
Well, was a baseball bat

13:28.459 --> 13:29.852
really necessary?FALLON:
Listen,

13:29.896 --> 13:31.854
we will pay for all of this
once we get our wallets.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
REYNAUD:
I hit the silent alarm

13:33.682 --> 13:36.032
as soon as I saw you return.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.425
I'll take thatback now.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.209
And don't forget the womanwho's throwing up outside.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.951
Hey, Fallon, I have
a new name for you:

13:41.995 --> 13:43.866
Felon Carrington.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.477
Ugly!

13:51.308 --> 13:53.267
Uh, sir?Yeah? Make it quick.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.530
I can't be late.My investigator's

13:55.573 --> 13:58.446
been looking into
Adam's childhood in Montana

13:58.489 --> 14:00.491
for that profile
you were talking about.Mm-hmm.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.320
And while they found
an adorable moment or two,

14:03.364 --> 14:06.541
they also found
sealed juvenile court records.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.543
Yeah, well, who doesn't have
sealed court records, huh?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.153
Boys'll be boys.Sir.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.548
I paid a premium to have
those records unsealed,

14:13.591 --> 14:15.158
and discovered that young Adam

14:15.202 --> 14:17.160
had a history
of violent outbursts,

14:17.204 --> 14:19.162
particularly
towards his adopted mother.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.947
Well, that's not exactlya news flash, is it?

14:20.990 --> 14:24.167
We know Adam's got a temper--he burned down my vineyard.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.996
He's a good son.He basically saved our lives.

14:28.693 --> 14:29.999
Forget the profile.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.175
We don't need it.I'll have my men return home.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.831
I think they're
required

14:35.875 --> 14:37.224
to give us food soon.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.400
What?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.184
I'm trying to look
at the bright side.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.882
I don't think you

14:42.925 --> 14:45.275
should be in chargeof the entertainment anymore.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.887
You told me you wanted the
party to be extra crazy,

14:47.930 --> 14:50.802
'cause you were mad at Liam for
not trusting you, okay? So...

14:50.846 --> 14:53.893
I didn't ask you to have usdrugged and thrown in jail.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.851
Oh, no, he's right, though.This whole thing started

14:55.895 --> 14:57.200
because youwere angry at Liam

14:57.244 --> 14:58.941
when all he didwas save your dad.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
Stop taking his side.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.944
I'm not taking his side.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.728
I'm actually taking Adam's side,because...

15:03.772 --> 15:05.687
Don't even say it.It's not the
time, Kirby.

15:05.730 --> 15:06.818
We're seeing each other.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.342
Ugh! Wow.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.387
Well, good luck with that. Youshould have invited Adam, too.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.172
I mean, Cristal's here.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.609
I'm here because I thoughtit'd be a nice way of showing

15:14.652 --> 15:17.133
that no matterwhat happens with Blake,we could still be friends.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.743
No, you said you were here

15:18.787 --> 15:20.397
so you could drink Blake
into oblivion.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.138
I could do that anywhere.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.706
Now I'm starting to understandLiam's point of view.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.403
How canhe trust you?

15:26.447 --> 15:28.579
You do go overboard
on everything.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.539
You're mad at Liam,
you marry someone else.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.628
You're mad at me,you ice me out.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.022
You probably gave methis black eye!

15:36.065 --> 15:37.371
Well, if I did, believe me,

15:37.414 --> 15:40.156
it is the one thing
I wish I could remember.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.810
Oh, my God, you
are themost...

15:41.853 --> 15:44.030
ungrateful,
spiteful...

15:44.073 --> 15:45.161
Shut up!

15:45.205 --> 15:46.858
MICHAEL:
Hello?

15:48.425 --> 15:49.949
Ah, thank God.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.385
Mmm, mmm!

15:51.428 --> 15:52.864
Mmm.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.649
Thank you for meeting

15:54.692 --> 15:57.565
and giving me a chance
to apologize for earlier.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.002
I assure youI was merely surprised.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.613
I would have been startled, too.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.441
That is kind of you
to understand.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.226
Jeff said you were sweet.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.314
He did?

16:07.357 --> 16:09.185
He is head over heels for you.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.101
And I'm just so happy
he's finally found someone

16:12.145 --> 16:14.190
he's thinking about
more seriously.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.977
He can be a difficult man
to pin down, that one.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.241
He was always kind of a player.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.285
Mm.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.461
But you two are platonic, right?

16:24.505 --> 16:26.681
Like, I'm not stepping
on anything?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.248
You have nothing to worry about.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.292
Oh!

16:29.336 --> 16:30.467
Oh!

16:30.511 --> 16:33.557
Alexis, ugh, you are so clumsy.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.168
Oh.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.735
A little soda water, and
it'll come right out.

16:37.779 --> 16:41.261
Oh, I think it's...gonna take more than that, dear.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.523
You know what?

16:42.566 --> 16:45.004
Why don't you take mine?

16:45.047 --> 16:47.136
No. That's fine.
It's-it's okay.No, no,

16:47.180 --> 16:48.964
no, I insist.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.358
You can't run around town
with Jeff Colby,

16:51.401 --> 16:54.796
carrying a purse that looks likeit was stolen from an aquarium.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.843
Consider it
a "get to know you" gift.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.803
Thank you.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.370
Thank you, that means a lot.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.460
So, how did you know
we were here?

17:06.503 --> 17:08.070
Well, Kirby called.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.594
Because apparently,
you won't contact Liam.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.814
Don't tell me you're still
mad about the Moldavia thing?

17:12.857 --> 17:15.164
He made a life-or-death decisionon my behalf

17:15.208 --> 17:17.253
because of the way
he assumed I would react.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.082
I mean, is that how
our marriage is gonna be?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.215
I'm sure he thought he was
doing what was best for you.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.868
Well, I didn't ask him to--
which is why

17:23.912 --> 17:25.261
it is all going
into the prenup.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.090
I am going to force him
to think of me as an equal

17:28.134 --> 17:30.397
and not some unreasonable childthat he has to rein in.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.008
Fallon, I'm sure he
doesn't think that.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.488
And if he does,

17:34.531 --> 17:37.230
then that's something
you two need to work out.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.233
I liked it better
when you hated him.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.451
Still not a big fan.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.887
All right, I've
got to head back

17:42.931 --> 17:44.454
and give the team
back their plane.Okay.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.239
We're good to go.Thanks for this.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.067
Of course. What's the point
of having your own plane

17:48.110 --> 17:50.112
if you can't use it on
the spur of the moment?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.593
I take it you all can
make it home on your own.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.421
But why don't I have
to bail out Allison?

17:54.464 --> 17:57.293
She didn't
end up coming?Allison?

17:57.337 --> 17:59.426
We forgot
about Allison.What if she's lost?

17:59.469 --> 18:00.688
Or lying in a ditch somewhere,

18:00.731 --> 18:02.907
and she's trying to call us
over and over,

18:02.951 --> 18:04.387
and her voiceis getting weaker,

18:04.431 --> 18:06.520
and she's reachingfor her phone...Shh, shh, shh.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.043
Give me your phone.What?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.350
I think she was trying
to call us over and over.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.483
What?The unknown number,
that must have been her.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.050
Allison?

18:16.269 --> 18:17.661
Okay. Where are you?

18:17.705 --> 18:20.316
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Fine, we'll be right there.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.622
How did you know it was her?

18:21.665 --> 18:23.319
Well, listening
to your horror story just now

18:23.363 --> 18:25.060
made me think back
to this morning in the room

18:25.104 --> 18:26.757
when the phone kept ringing,
and then I realized

18:26.801 --> 18:28.411
the only person annoying enoughto call every hour

18:28.455 --> 18:31.022
is Allison.So where is she?

18:31.066 --> 18:32.850
She's in the hospital.
I'm just prayingWhat?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.591
she remembers something
about my wedding.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.333
And that she's okay.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.379
Of course.Thank you.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.556
I need a quick and
favorable ruling.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.384
Which should be simple, since
your department is handling

18:44.427 --> 18:46.777
the probe into C.A.I know I owe you, Blake,

18:46.821 --> 18:47.909
but you're asking a lot.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.824
This is
a high-profile case for us.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.608
All right, think of it this way.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.002
The more powerful I am,
the more influence I'll have

18:54.045 --> 18:57.310
to help you get that Secretary
of Energy spot one day.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.921
That doesn't happen if
you don't fix this for me.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.662
You do make a very good point.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.273
BLAKE:
What the...?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.059
This way.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.454
What the hell was that?

19:24.772 --> 19:25.773
Are you okay?

19:25.816 --> 19:27.209
Not really.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.820
You clearly have Moldavian
terrorists after you.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.735
I don't need my life in danger.

19:31.779 --> 19:32.867
It's just a smoke canister.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.390
I think it's pretty clear
they're here

19:34.434 --> 19:35.826
and they are angry.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.002
And I haven't even done
anything for you yet.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.309
Who knows how far they'll go
if I actually help?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.876
You can't do this, Olivia.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.617
I need you to end
this investigation.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.793
It's too hot right now,
and I'm not gonna do anything

19:45.836 --> 19:47.925
to jeopardize
my career or my family.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.666
I'm sorry.
We need to wait

19:49.710 --> 19:51.712
until everything
cools down.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.976
So, any big planstomorrow?

19:55.019 --> 19:57.283
Mm... going to work,

19:57.326 --> 20:00.111
yoga, meal prepfor the week.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.723
Nothing tooinsane, huh?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.551
I think I've outgrown
the insane in my life.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.117
Oh, wait.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.945
Some days I skip the gym.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.164
That's crazy, right?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.949
Wild.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.429
MIA:Mm.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.039
Those martinis
are strong.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.303
Now I need to go visit
the ladies' room.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.139
Mia, huh?

20:28.183 --> 20:29.837
I've been on a few
dates with her, too.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.143
You used the
Sugar4Hire app, right?

20:32.187 --> 20:34.102
Sugar4Hire?

20:34.145 --> 20:35.973
We both know who she is.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.932
Mia only dates wealthy guys.

20:37.975 --> 20:41.240
Expensive tastes, but...
worth every penny.

20:42.763 --> 20:43.981
Hey.

20:44.025 --> 20:44.895
Have fun, man.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.593
I sure did.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.354
It's all right, Tony,
I found it.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.182
Only my daughter would use
a priceless work of art

21:11.226 --> 21:13.663
to house common weeds. Hmm.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.205
Yes. Ignore my previous
phone call.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.904
Uh, keep investigating
Adam Carrington.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.646
Go as deep as necessary.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.431
Report back only to me.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.912
JEFF:
You ever hear of Sugar4Hire?

21:44.955 --> 21:47.523
Is it food delivery? Because
this crudité isn't cutting it.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
It's a service
that matches younger women

21:49.177 --> 21:50.831
with rich men to date.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.528
I'm not that desperate, Jeff.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.139
I found Mia's profile on there.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.663
Turns outshe's a gold digger.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.055
Only after me for my money.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.970
I am so sorry.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.885
You can't tell
about some people.

22:01.929 --> 22:05.715
Oh, and you should've seen this$20,000 bag she was carrying.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.804
And when I mentioned it,
she made up this crazy story

22:07.848 --> 22:09.066
that you gave it to her.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.416
What?

22:10.459 --> 22:12.113
I mean, we met for drinks,

22:12.156 --> 22:14.637
but I wouldn't even
give Fallon that bag.

22:14.681 --> 22:17.858
No, she must've gotten it from
one of those sugar daddies.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.077
That harlot.
She doesn't deserve you.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.516
Okay, you can drop the act.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.082
What act?

22:25.126 --> 22:27.084
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

22:27.128 --> 22:29.086
I'm a tech billionaire, Alexis.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.828
I did a background check on Miabefore we even went out.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.004
That sugar baby profilenever popped up.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.441
So then I hacked
into your credit card account.

22:35.484 --> 22:36.964
That's a violation
of my privacy.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.008
Are you gonna call the police?

22:38.052 --> 22:39.358
Huh? Anyway,

22:39.401 --> 22:41.621
I saw you bought that bag
this morning.

22:41.664 --> 22:44.014
Why the hell are you trying
to ruin my relationship?

22:44.058 --> 22:45.146
Because...

22:47.235 --> 22:48.584
...I'm your wife.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.107
By arrangement.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.632
There's no reason for us
to stay married anymore.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.722
I like being Mrs. Colby, okay?

22:57.114 --> 22:59.987
It gives me
a certain cachet in society

23:00.030 --> 23:02.468
and name recognition
for my podcast.

23:02.511 --> 23:05.471
You know what?
I've had enough of this.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.734
I'm filing for divorce
in the morning.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.656
Thought I'd bring your favorite.I trust the meeting went well?

23:16.699 --> 23:18.266
Actually, it didn't.

23:18.309 --> 23:21.356
The Moldavian government
sent someone to attack us.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.271
What? A-Are you okay?

23:23.314 --> 23:25.969
Yeah, I'm fine. It was more
of a warning, really.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.972
Nobody was hurt.
My eyes got a little red.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.672
So, your contact, are they
still gonna help, or...?

23:32.715 --> 23:34.978
No, she was, she was shaken.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.067
Really upset.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.157
But your old man was able
to turn things around.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.594
You were?

23:41.637 --> 23:45.815
Yeah. Well, the attack
gave me a great idea.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.078
You know, it's just
a short leap from caving

23:48.122 --> 23:50.167
to terroriststo working with them.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.474
So I asked Walker what her bosswould think if she was

23:52.518 --> 23:54.171
in business with the Moldavians.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.347
It'd be so easy to make it looklike she was getting kickbacks

23:56.391 --> 23:58.045
from them to screw over

23:58.088 --> 24:01.962
an upstanding American citizensuch as myself.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.009
This time tomorrow,C.A. will be back online,

24:06.053 --> 24:08.098
those tankers will beat our refinery,

24:08.142 --> 24:10.231
just in time
for the press conference.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.754
That's how we do it.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.195
Drop the pudding.
We need to talk.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.502
What do you rememberabout last night?

24:20.546 --> 24:21.851
And most importantly,do you remember

24:21.895 --> 24:23.418
who I married?You married someone?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.202
Oh, my God. You were supposed
to be the responsible one.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.856
I'm so sorry.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.250
The nurse told me I fell off
a mechanical bull.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.034
Guess none of you noticed,
because a stranger

24:31.078 --> 24:32.514
brought me here
with a concussion.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.168
We just left you there?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.952
Yeah, but don't feel bad.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.041
I broke out of my comfort zone
and had a great time.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.303
I assume.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.827
Well, now I do feel bad.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.220
Not because of you,so much,

24:43.264 --> 24:45.266
but because we'releaving tomorrow,

24:45.309 --> 24:47.094
and I haveto tell Liam,

24:47.137 --> 24:52.273
my fiancé, that I marriedsomeone else because I got mad.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.404
Which just proveshis point.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.885
I am a child.
Why should I be trusted?

24:55.929 --> 24:57.147
I do go overboard.

24:57.191 --> 25:00.281
Well, I mean,we all went overboard.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.804
It's not just on you.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.806
Yeah.

25:03.850 --> 25:07.244
Look, guys, I'm sorry
that I yelled at you

25:07.288 --> 25:09.290
when you were just tryingto do what I wanted you to do

25:09.333 --> 25:11.205
and be a good bride tribe.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.467
And good friends.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.425
You know what?

25:14.469 --> 25:16.340
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

25:16.384 --> 25:20.606
What matters is that we've
dodged jail, ridden bulls.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.043
Stolen jewelry.Wrestled anacondas.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.218
JENNINGS:
So we can definitely
figure out

25:24.261 --> 25:27.613
this Scorpio situation,
together.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.005
KIRBY:
Or...

25:29.049 --> 25:31.268
we just make sure
that Liam never,

25:31.312 --> 25:33.227
ever finds
out about it.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.271
Girl code, right?

25:34.315 --> 25:35.621
I can help as soon as I change.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.231
Can someone undo this thing?

25:37.274 --> 25:39.320
No. Not my job.Ah, come here.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.497
Oh.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.021
What is it? Is it bad?

25:48.372 --> 25:49.199
FALLON:"Scorpio"?

25:49.243 --> 25:51.767
"The Anaconda Club"?

25:51.811 --> 25:54.117
Why does that sound familiar?It's a strip club.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.206
Oh, come on.
I married a stripper?

26:03.953 --> 26:05.476
The staff told me you were here.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.087
It's nice Blakeoccasionally lets you

26:07.130 --> 26:08.610
out of the house for some air.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.481
Now, to whatdo I owe this headache,

26:10.525 --> 26:12.266
because I am reallynot in the mood.

26:12.309 --> 26:16.749
I've just discovered thatmy daughter is dating your son.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.707
Really?

26:18.751 --> 26:22.929
Well, good taste has never beenone of Adam's strong suits.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.194
I could say the
same about Kirby.

26:27.237 --> 26:29.239
But I've been looking
into Adam's past,

26:29.283 --> 26:30.763
and I'm a bit worried.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.374
He's left quite a trail
of violence behind him.

26:33.417 --> 26:36.333
Now, I know you two
have always been close,

26:36.377 --> 26:38.031
but has he ever hurt you?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.949
Adam is a mama's boy
through and through.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.559
He would never hurt me.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.343
He actually saved my
life when I tripped

26:46.387 --> 26:48.563
into the fireplace
and burned my face.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.304
You know, I've always wondered,

26:50.347 --> 26:53.350
how does one trip
into a fireplace?

26:53.394 --> 26:57.572
And lie there long enoughfor their face to melt off?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.835
Well, you'd thinkyour reflexes would kick in.

26:59.879 --> 27:04.100
Well, my reflexes were
slowed from too much wine.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.363
I'm fortunate my son
arrived when he did,

27:06.407 --> 27:10.280
and that's all there is
to that story, I'm afraid.

27:10.324 --> 27:14.110
Yeah, well, I'm probably justbeing an overprotective father.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.113
I'll show myself out.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.423
♪ Hey, you don't want
no ... problem ♪

27:22.466 --> 27:24.294
♪ You know, uh-uh...

27:24.338 --> 27:26.079
I told you no strip clubs.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.863
Well, I was under the influence.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.039
But how great is this place?

27:31.388 --> 27:32.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.391
I don't think so. Okay? Out.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.524
Out.Whoa. What do you mean, out?

27:36.567 --> 27:38.091
We just got here.No, no, no.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.570
You were banned
from the club last night.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.224
What? Why?

27:41.268 --> 27:42.573
She jumped onstage

27:42.617 --> 27:44.227
for a lap dance,but her face got in the way

27:44.271 --> 27:45.707
of a stripper's elbow.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.535
We had to kick you all out
for rowdiness.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.406
I'm sorry I accused
you of punching me.Mm-hmm.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.279
Then you all snuck back in,
and you ran off with Andy.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.455
I would never run off
with an Andy.

27:54.498 --> 27:55.586
Okay?

27:55.630 --> 27:58.459
Wait, is Andy an anaconda?

27:58.502 --> 28:01.636
You know what? Just getout of here, all right?Before I call the cops.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.030
No-- Okay, come on. We don'tneed to go to jail again.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.858
FALLON:We can't just give up.We need a New Orleans miracle.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.383
What?

28:12.255 --> 28:14.257
SAM: Yeah, baby!

28:14.301 --> 28:15.911
Allison...Hey! My walkie!

28:15.955 --> 28:17.565
KIRBY: Go, Allison!FALLON: Let's go.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.436
You need to givethat girl a raise.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.742
FALLON:
Hurry!

28:20.786 --> 28:22.744
The smoke bomb did scare
her, but somehow Blake

28:22.788 --> 28:24.920
still managed to
talk her into it.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.967
It was a good plan,
but your father always manages

28:28.010 --> 28:29.533
to weasel his way
out of trouble.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.753
All right, so we
figure out another way.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.494
An un-weaselable way.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.932
Between this plan failing

28:36.976 --> 28:39.195
and Jeff wanting a divorce...

28:39.239 --> 28:41.502
maybe it's time to move on.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.681
Do you want to talk about it?

28:48.465 --> 28:50.293
I'm not in the mood yet.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.774
Great, neither am I,
but here's the thing.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.255
You're the one who taught me
never to give up.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.605
Blake would've left me
to rot in a dungeon

28:57.648 --> 28:59.955
just to save C.A.; he would've
kept you from your children.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.957
That's why we
continue to fight

29:02.001 --> 29:04.525
for whatever we want.

29:04.568 --> 29:08.268
This is the first time you've
ever given me a pep talk.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.530
Look at my boy.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.401
All grown up.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.969
Well, your boy has a new plan.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.667
And all I need is your trust.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.322
And a little money.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.980
Is thatall there is?

29:25.024 --> 29:27.156
Yes, it's her
entire medical file

fell into the fire.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.876

their names written

29:50.919 --> 29:52.616
on their tiny
little underwear.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.359

Hi. Finally.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.077
Fallon Carrington.Yeah, I know.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.687
I was wondering when
you guys were coming back.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.819
Oh. You mean,
when we were gonna come back,

31:48.863 --> 31:50.604
or when you could score
some more

31:50.647 --> 31:51.866
free bling?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.868
Apparently, I'm your wife.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.913
My wife?

31:54.956 --> 31:57.959
No, uh, I didn't marry you.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.395
I married him.

♪ Something
in the air tonight... ♪

32:00.831 --> 32:02.007
What?

32:10.319 --> 32:12.321
What now?

32:12.365 --> 32:15.324
I'm not ready to give
up on our marriage.

32:15.368 --> 32:18.023
Even if that means having
to tell you the truth

32:18.066 --> 32:21.461
about my feelings and
letting you see the real me.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.680
Well, this iskind of the third real you,

32:23.724 --> 32:25.117
but I get it.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.470
I didn't like seeing
you with that girl.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.081
I think there's
something between us,

32:33.125 --> 32:35.692
and you know it, too.

32:35.736 --> 32:39.218
You were the first person to
visit me after my accident.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.872
You tried to protect
me from Adam,

32:41.916 --> 32:43.962
and you came to see me

32:44.005 --> 32:45.876
when you thought
you were dying.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.792
If all of that means nothing,

32:48.836 --> 32:51.491
I'll give you your divorce.

32:51.534 --> 32:55.756
Maybe there is a seedof something between us.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.498
But if we went there,it-it'd get messy.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.848
You are a lot, Alexis.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.589
Look at the stuntyou pulled with Mia.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.330
That's not whatI need right now.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.548
What you don't need

33:05.592 --> 33:09.465
is simple, uncomplicated Mia.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.467
She will make you dull.

33:11.511 --> 33:14.209
And one day, she will do
something even worse.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.559
She will bore you.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.474
Sometimes,a man just wants to take

33:18.518 --> 33:20.868
the easy, well-paved road.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.610
Not Jeff Colby.

33:23.653 --> 33:26.917
Yeah, I pulled that stunt.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.789
I keep you
on your toes.

33:28.832 --> 33:31.444
And if you have
a new lease on life,

33:31.487 --> 33:36.057
why not choose
the more interesting life?

33:57.557 --> 33:58.906
So, the first time we came in...

33:58.949 --> 34:00.864
Everyone was pretty wasted.Especially you.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.605
I heard.

34:02.649 --> 34:05.086
But I'm-I'm notlike that, really.

34:05.130 --> 34:05.956
Well, normally.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.828
I-I have a lot going on.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.786
Anyway, uh, in all the chaos,

34:09.830 --> 34:11.788
you left your phonesand wallets here, so...

34:11.832 --> 34:13.312
FALLON:
Oh, thank you.Yeah, of course.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.923
So, um, when exactly
did I propose?

34:15.966 --> 34:18.534
I mean, I assume that I was
the one who proposed, right?

34:18.578 --> 34:20.710
Yeah, you did.Uh, apparently,

34:20.754 --> 34:23.191
you went to the barand were moved

34:23.235 --> 34:25.976
by some story that Fallonwas telling everyone

34:26.020 --> 34:28.936
about marrying a total strangerand falling in love.

34:28.979 --> 34:30.024
Oh, yes! Yes!Yeah?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.939
Me and Liam. Aw.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.332
What a sweet story.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.116
You see? Sometimes,
going overboard pays off.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.858
So, what else did he say I said?Not your turn.

34:37.901 --> 34:40.034
So, then we must have
gone to that store

34:40.078 --> 34:41.644
to buy wedding
clothes, right?

34:41.688 --> 34:42.993
Or steal them.

34:43.037 --> 34:44.908
Well, you came backall decked out

34:44.952 --> 34:47.433
and got down on a kneewith Fallon's ring.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.349
Wow. I cannot believe
I let you borrow my ring

34:50.392 --> 34:51.654
to propose to a stripper.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.352
Well, you asked for mineas collateral.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.397
Well, at least my business sense

34:55.441 --> 34:57.791
still remained intact
when I was blackout drunk.

34:57.834 --> 35:00.141
Uh, so, that would explain
this gumball machine ring

35:00.185 --> 35:01.534
I'm wearing.SCORPIO: Yeah.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.666
We got marriedat an all-night chapel.

35:03.710 --> 35:07.409
Wow. Blackout me is leaving
sober me speechless.

35:07.453 --> 35:10.151
Well, as useful
as you have been,

35:10.195 --> 35:12.284
Scorpio, I would, uh,

35:12.327 --> 35:13.894
like my ring back.Oh, yeah.

35:13.937 --> 35:16.201
There you go.
Oh, man. I got to tell you,

35:16.244 --> 35:18.899
I am really happy
we're not married,

35:18.942 --> 35:21.249
'cause thatwould have been bad. Yeah.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.077
Bye. Thanks so much.SCORPIO: Bye.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.687
Thank you.KIRBY:It was really nice to meet you.

35:24.731 --> 35:25.993
SCORPIO:Yeah. Bye.Bye.

35:27.342 --> 35:30.084
So, we can get an
easy annulment,

35:30.128 --> 35:31.216
right?Yeah.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.522
Of course.But, hey, can I...

35:33.566 --> 35:36.046
Can I call you
if I'm in Atlanta?

35:36.090 --> 35:39.528
Last night was, uh,
actually pretty fun.

35:39.572 --> 35:42.488
You know, maybe we could start
with a-a date.

35:42.531 --> 35:45.969
Um, look, you seem really cool,

35:46.013 --> 35:49.234
but, um, I'm actually trying
to keep it cas.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.236
You know, not really
looking to settle down.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.151
Right.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.110
Well,

35:56.154 --> 35:59.679
just in case you changeyour mind, there it is.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.116
Ryan?Mm-hmm.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.074
Thank God
your name's not Scorpio.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.301
I can't tell youhow proud and thrilled I am

36:13.345 --> 36:15.738
to have the company
back in the family

36:15.782 --> 36:18.045
and to be CEO once again,

36:18.088 --> 36:20.700
this time with my sonas my number two.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.137
Now, you all know
that Carrington Atlantic

36:23.181 --> 36:24.617

profitable company,

36:24.660 --> 36:26.488

36:30.275 --> 36:32.233
about the refinery explosion?

36:32.277 --> 36:34.627
How will the loss
of $500 million in oil

36:34.670 --> 36:36.063
affect C.A.?That...

36:39.109 --> 36:40.546
What the hell is that?

36:40.589 --> 36:42.287
Is that one of ours?It was.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.724
Apparently, the Moldavian
oil was tainted.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.248
Caused an explosion at therefinery. There's no casualties,

36:47.292 --> 36:50.120
but it's gonna be a nightmare
financially and PR-wise.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.426
They're gonna be
out for blood.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.863
Yeah, I know that.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.517
NEWSWOMAN:Mr. Carrington?

36:55.561 --> 36:57.998

37:01.044 --> 37:03.003
Mr. Carrington!Mr. Carrington, wait!

37:03.046 --> 37:05.266
You were right.The prenup was a bad idea.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.225
You know, and even thoughI didn't marry Magic Mike,

37:07.268 --> 37:10.184
I am capableof going a little crazy.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.012
So you're saying Liam was right?

37:12.055 --> 37:13.448
No, no, no. I'm not
saying he was right.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.755
I'm saying I understand
why he made that decision.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.539
And Culhane may have talked

37:17.583 --> 37:19.106
a little sense into me.Oh.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.761
I guess I can't have all the
control in a partnership.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.893
You giving up control?

37:23.937 --> 37:25.330
Ha!SAM:Guys?

37:25.373 --> 37:26.461

37:27.636 --> 37:28.811
What?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.422
I want to see.And yes, I broke

37:30.465 --> 37:32.467
your "no pictures" rule,but what did you expect?

37:32.511 --> 37:33.816
Some of these were sent

37:51.181 --> 37:52.574
I hopewe can stay friends,

37:52.618 --> 37:55.142
no matter what happenswith me and your dad.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.491
Don't worry.

37:56.535 --> 37:59.146
You'll always be my
second evil stepmother.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.235
Cute.

38:03.063 --> 38:06.240
Oh, again with the lurking.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.329
I know you're dating Adam.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.331
You need to stay
away from him.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.160
What happened to trusting mewith my own love life?

38:13.203 --> 38:15.989
I would
if I didn't care about you.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.469
What are you even on about?

38:17.512 --> 38:19.166
Adam's dangerous.

38:19.209 --> 38:21.255
He has a history
of hurting people.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.387
I-In fact,

38:22.430 --> 38:24.737
Alexis didn't fall
into the fireplace.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.347
He shoved her into it.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.741
He burned her.
He's deranged.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.308
And you believethat lying bitch? She claimed

38:30.351 --> 38:32.310
that I burned the manor downso you'd send me away.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.050
Yeah, again, I'm
sorry about that.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.314
But I verified this with
the hospital records.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.838
Alexis claimed she was drunk.
That's why she tripped.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.144
But her tox report
came back clean.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.711
She had bruising on
her back and her neck,

38:42.755 --> 38:44.365
like someone had been
holding her down.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.194
Hello? You're the onethat sounds deranged.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.022
It's obvious you don't likethat I'm dating Adam,

38:49.065 --> 38:50.284
and you're using liesto break us up.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.590
If you'll just listen to me...

38:51.633 --> 38:53.331
Oh, I'm done listening.

38:58.858 --> 39:02.644
So, I assumeour deal is back on

39:02.688 --> 39:06.169
and we're gonna stay marriedthe rest of the year?

39:06.213 --> 39:09.259
Can we just take
it day by day?

39:09.303 --> 39:10.870
Mmm. I can do that.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.394
But I think you're gonna wantto extend our contract

39:13.438 --> 39:15.440
after you see this.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.443
Adam bribed the ship's captain

39:18.486 --> 39:21.141
to poison the oil tanker
with a toxic solution,

39:21.184 --> 39:22.969
and once it reached
the refinery...

39:24.362 --> 39:27.103
Blake losthalf a billion dollars,

39:27.147 --> 39:29.584
and this isjust the beginning.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.284
I admire your
resilience, Alexis.

39:34.328 --> 39:38.332
And I'll support you if that's
what you want to focus on.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.116
But I meant what I said.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.555
Life is too short to waste
it avenging the past.

39:43.598 --> 39:47.341
Right now, I just
want to enjoy myself.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.345
I can help with that, too.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.392
Hey, Cristal. Um...

39:54.435 --> 39:56.350
Yeah, I know
I haven't called you.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.919
Uh, but I just wanted
to give you some space.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.879
And, um...

40:03.923 --> 40:06.926
It's been a really bad day.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.886
Yeah, I've only been CEO a week,

40:10.930 --> 40:13.846
and the company's already
on the brink financially.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.418
It's really hard
to trust anyone

40:20.461 --> 40:21.810
when you're a Carrington.

40:23.812 --> 40:27.729
And it's even harder to let yourself love sometimes.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.602
But you pushed past
all my defenses.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.169
You're the only one
that I want to talk to

40:33.213 --> 40:35.955
and be with
when the going gets tough.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.957
So...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.742
Would you please come back?

40:40.786 --> 40:43.310
What's wrong?

40:43.353 --> 40:46.052
My dad doesn't like
me seeing you.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.141
Really? Um...

40:48.184 --> 40:49.447
He told me you were dangerous,

40:49.490 --> 40:52.362
and he went on and on
with this insane story

40:52.406 --> 40:54.539
about how you shoved Alexis
into a fireplace?

40:54.582 --> 40:56.541
What?

40:56.584 --> 40:58.586
Did my mother tell him that?

40:58.630 --> 41:00.675
No clue.

41:00.719 --> 41:02.285
All I know is it's ridiculous.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.331
I don't know why
I brought it up.I-It is.

41:04.374 --> 41:06.725
It's completely
ridiculous. Don't...

41:06.768 --> 41:08.770
Don't even think about it.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.513
Whatever.
It's been a crazy 48 hours

41:12.557 --> 41:15.037
since I last saw you,
and I did promise you

41:15.081 --> 41:17.083
some steamy new moves.Mm-hmm.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.741
Cream or sugar?

41:22.784 --> 41:24.830
I'm good. Thank you.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.658
So, what are you going
to be doing up north?

41:26.701 --> 41:28.094
Some fly-fishing?

41:28.137 --> 41:31.489
More like hunting.Hmm.
