00:05.900 --> 00:08.167
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:08.200 --> 00:10.767
strange weather spreads
across the Arctic,

00:10.800 --> 00:13.533
putting Alaska on thin ice.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.667
CHIP: Two inches ice.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.900
AGNES: Whoa! Fuck that!

00:16.933 --> 00:19.833
NARRATOR: Arctic predators
come knocking at Sue's door.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.900
The bears,
their main food source

00:21.933 --> 00:24.900
is anything they can
get their paws on.

00:24.933 --> 00:28.133
NARRATOR: The search is on
for an elusive Arctic fur.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.300
Got a wolf right there.

00:30.667 --> 00:34.000
And a novice
to life in the bush
makes a rookie mistake.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.200
Anything can happen out there.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.500
Whoa!

00:37.933 --> 00:39.800
-(WIND BLOWING)
-(ICE CRACKLING)

00:56.567 --> 00:58.467
CHIP: This freeze-up
is basically a month late.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.100
We should've been
already almost
done fishing by now,

01:01.133 --> 01:03.600
and now it's warming
back up again after it froze.

01:03.633 --> 01:06.467
So, I'm worried about the ice
still staying thin,

01:06.500 --> 01:11.433
the weather warming up
like it has, and falling
through the ice.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.433
That's my concern.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.967
And it's only got
a couple inches of ice,
which isn't very safe.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.600
It's safe to walk over,
but not to put a load on,

01:19.633 --> 01:22.667
and if we have adults working,

01:22.700 --> 01:24.033
and we're piling up a net

01:24.067 --> 01:25.833
which weighs
hundreds of pounds,

01:25.867 --> 01:28.667
and on top of that
piles of fish,

01:28.700 --> 01:30.800
we're really looking
to just kill ourselves.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.300
Let's go down
to the ice hole, I guess.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.067
The weather rules everything,

01:35.100 --> 01:36.600
and I'm not saying
the weather's messing with me,

01:36.633 --> 01:38.000
but I'm trying to
roll with the weather,

01:38.033 --> 01:40.367
and it's not doing
what I want it to do.
(CHUCKLES)

01:40.400 --> 01:45.400
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
ice fishing is a vital
yet dangerous way of life.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.467
Until the ice
is safe to fish on,

01:47.500 --> 01:50.467
the family will be
without a key winter currency.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.300
CHIP: We got a lot of fish
from this summer.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.667
We got a lot of caribou.
What we don't have is extra.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.667
And when it comes
to making money
or making good trade

01:57.700 --> 02:00.633
-this would be, kind of,
a financial loss to us.
-(DOG BARKS)

02:00.667 --> 02:02.000
You know, we're halfway
through our lives.

02:02.033 --> 02:03.300
We're middle-aged. We know it.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.667
Every little instance
that we have to watch out for,

02:05.700 --> 02:08.067
we know every little instance
that we have to make up for,

02:08.100 --> 02:10.733
and we know what
our monthly goals are
for income,

02:10.767 --> 02:13.000
and not only
maintaining our life,
but improving our life.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.333
So, we'll see what happens.

02:21.033 --> 02:24.500
AGNES: This is
the Kobuk River.
It's deep. It's wide.

02:24.533 --> 02:28.000
We've been just watching
the conditions for the
last couple few days

02:28.033 --> 02:30.000
and watching
the ice conditions here.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.733
(CRACKING)

02:35.600 --> 02:37.767
Whoa!

02:37.800 --> 02:40.667
I don't like
that crackling sound.
It's just fuckin'...

02:42.033 --> 02:43.633
CHIP: Here's how thick it is.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.000
AGNES: Right there.

02:47.533 --> 02:51.900
-There's a rule about
working on ice that thin.
-(CLANGING)

02:51.933 --> 02:53.633
I wouldn't want to put
the weight of the fish,

02:53.667 --> 02:55.167
and the weight of the net
on this.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.367
That's just not gonna work.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.433
Ice is between an inch
and two inches thick,

02:59.467 --> 03:01.700
and we have a two-inch rule
for walking over.

03:01.733 --> 03:04.733
We have four-inch rule
for doing any kind
of work whatsoever.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.167
And I want six inches,

03:06.200 --> 03:08.433
because I definitely
wanna be able
to put a pile of fish

03:08.467 --> 03:11.200
and do my work
without worrying about
the whole thing collapsing in,

03:11.233 --> 03:12.667
people dying.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.967
Yeah. See?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.233
You can see
how the different layers...
It's like shale.

03:18.267 --> 03:19.800
So when you're dealing
with that kind of ice

03:19.833 --> 03:21.833
you're not dealing
with ice that has integrity.

03:24.367 --> 03:27.833
Every sign we see
is just danger.

03:27.867 --> 03:31.133
So, we just have to
keep waiting and play it safe.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.300
There's no money
worth dying for.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.833
There's no trade
worth dying for, so...

03:35.867 --> 03:38.533
I ain't having
no part of this.

03:38.567 --> 03:41.167
CHIP: So ends
this day of fishing.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.533
We will return when the ice
is happy and thick.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.233
AGNES: One more day
should be good, huh?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.767
CHIP: Yeah, one more day.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.900
(STARTS ENGINE)

03:55.633 --> 03:58.033
SUE: Looking at
the signs of nature,
looking at the animals,

03:58.067 --> 04:00.600
looking at things,

04:00.633 --> 04:05.000
I predict this is gonna be
one hell of a bad winter.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.267
SUE: Time to do
a little maintenance.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.133
Time for me
to change my oil
on my generator.

04:23.533 --> 04:27.267
This year, winter came in
with a roar.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.767
The caribou, everything
migrated out a month,
month and a half early,

04:30.800 --> 04:33.500
and then all of a sudden
up comes the South-Pacific air

04:33.533 --> 04:36.733
in what's called
the Pineapple Express,
and I warmed right back up.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.667
With the warm weather
that's happening,
I'm having to run my generator

04:39.700 --> 04:43.600
to keep all my frozen food
frozen far longer than normal.

04:43.633 --> 04:46.133
It's not the 20, or 30,
or 40 below it should be.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.900
I don't want to waste food,

04:49.933 --> 04:54.000
but I can't afford to keep
this generator running solely
to keep food frozen.

04:54.033 --> 04:57.267
NARRATOR: Warmer temperatures
are not only wreaking
havoc on Sue,

04:57.300 --> 05:00.933
but could also be
upsetting the behaviour
of local predators.

05:00.967 --> 05:06.867
Animals need it to be
well below zero
so they can hibernate.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.533
Without it being cold enough,

05:08.567 --> 05:12.433
they're using up
precious resources
that they need.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.567
They need to be asleep.
They need to hibernate.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.833
As crazy as it sounds,
we depend on it getting cold.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.067
Only being 15-20 miles,

05:23.100 --> 05:27.267
you know, up to 30 miles
away from the Arctic Ocean,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.400
I've got polar bears
that hang out at the coast.

05:30.433 --> 05:33.900
I now could very well
be in the sights
of those polar bears.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.633
-(GRUNTS) Piece of...
-(STARTS MOTOR)

05:48.100 --> 05:54.133
Usually this time of year
I'm 20-30 below zero or more.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.800
Garbage, frozen stuff
isn't gonna give off a smell,

05:58.833 --> 06:01.067
but this year, you know,
it's 40Â°.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.000
Now I'm 70Â° above
where I normally am.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.700
It's a fluke.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.167
So, the garbage is gonna
give off a smell.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.300
That's like becoming
a bait station.

06:12.333 --> 06:16.500
So, another way
of arming yourself with safety
is get it burnt.

06:20.967 --> 06:23.167
It's something
you, kind of, want to layer.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.367
(CLATTERING)

06:26.533 --> 06:30.033
The bears,
their main food source,

06:30.067 --> 06:33.600
which is caribou, long gone.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.467
So, what are they eating?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.167
Anything they can
get their paws on.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.767
Bears smell
from ten miles away.

06:39.800 --> 06:46.200
Fifteen miles or so away
I've got usually
quite a few polar bears.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.767
The sea ice,
the pack ice isn't in.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.500
So, the polar bears
are starting to get
a little bit upset about that.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.067
They want their food.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.700
I need to burn this stuff,
and I need to use
enough accelerant

06:56.733 --> 07:02.033
that it's not sitting there
smelling like leftover salmon
or leftover food

07:02.067 --> 07:04.200
that they might be
interested in.

07:04.233 --> 07:07.800
I don't think a person
is a polar bear's
natural diet,

07:07.833 --> 07:12.133
but they can't get out
and get their natural diet
right now.

07:12.167 --> 07:15.867
So, I don't want to
leave myself open for some
unprecedented attention.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.900
(CLATTERING)

07:26.967 --> 07:31.267
ANDY: You gotta be
a proactive person
to live this lifestyle.

07:32.167 --> 07:33.467
If you're submissive,

07:33.500 --> 07:36.767
if you're waiting for
other people to do it for you,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
you ain't gonna get it.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.667
ANDY: What do you think, Berg?

07:44.700 --> 07:46.533
-Wanna go to a new spot today?
-(BERG BARKS)

07:46.567 --> 07:48.200
KATE: So, you're loosening up
the doghouses.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.267
You think we can move
those doghouses today?

07:50.300 --> 07:52.367
-Yeah. It's time.
-I've got a list
of where to put 'em.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.800
Yeah.

07:53.833 --> 07:54.833
Winter lot.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.567
-Hey, Cody!
-CODY: Yeah?

07:57.600 --> 08:00.333
-Wanna move some dog houses?
-CODY: Yes, ma'am!

08:00.367 --> 08:02.733
Today's a big day.
We're gonna move
our dog houses

08:02.767 --> 08:05.067
with the help of Cody,
our new student.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.867
He's here to learn
about dog mushing,

08:06.900 --> 08:09.033
subsistence living,
bush skills.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.400
For 20 or 30 years,
I've been dog mushing,

08:11.433 --> 08:14.667
but what goes along with that
is not just sitting
in the sled.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.800
It's learning how to
take care of dogs.

08:17.833 --> 08:21.200
You want to go to
the winter dog lot, Iceberg?

08:21.233 --> 08:23.167
NARRATOR:
In Eagle, a lack of snowfall

08:23.200 --> 08:26.500
has delayed the start
of dog mushing season.

08:26.533 --> 08:29.533
-ANDY: It's really late. We're
already into mid-November.
-(DOG SQUEAKING)

08:29.567 --> 08:33.400
We're about
two to three weeks behind
where I normally would be.

08:33.433 --> 08:37.300
Climate change
is really screwing with us
up here in the north.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.933
If there's one thing
you can count on,

08:38.967 --> 08:41.600
it's that you can't ever
count on the weather.

08:41.633 --> 08:44.167
-So, it's time to start
getting these dogs in shape.
-(DOG SQUEAKING)

08:44.200 --> 08:47.033
I have someone young here.
He's never done it.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.567
It's gonna be fun for me
to teach him how to do it.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.033
At the same time,
it's gonna benefit me
by getting more dogs out.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.533
-The dogs are excited.
They know what's going on.
-(BARKING)

08:55.567 --> 08:59.433
They know it's time to start
getting serious
about dog mushing.

08:59.467 --> 09:03.033
What we usually do, Cody,
is in the summertime,
sled dogs love to dig.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.100
CODY: Yeah.

09:04.133 --> 09:07.633
We want our winter lot
to be hole-free.

09:07.667 --> 09:11.900
Because when they dig holes
like this you slip and fall
with a bucket of food,

09:11.933 --> 09:14.167
or twist your ankle, whatever.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.133
It's just an accident
waiting to happen.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.000
CODY: My intentions
coming out here, mainly,

09:18.033 --> 09:20.500
is to just try and learn
as much as I can
from Andy and Kate,

09:20.533 --> 09:22.400
and a lot of that,
I don't know what
I'm going to be learning.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.300
I just know
I want to live out here,

09:24.333 --> 09:26.667
and I want to know
what it takes
to live out here.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.733
-So, anyway, let's get moving.
-KATE: Burning daylight, guys.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.500
ANDY: Kate's got the list.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.833
So, you guys can just go ahead
and start moving those.

09:32.867 --> 09:34.733
I'll, kind of, work these
towards the front.

09:36.533 --> 09:41.467
KATE: Okay, Stoli's going
next to Vixen,
front row, second last.

have them spaced out

09:51.367 --> 09:52.567
and placed in certain areas?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.167
Well, there's certain ones
that are really good friends,

09:55.200 --> 09:59.367

never be living together.

is coming apart.

-(EXHALING) Okay.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.800
CODY: As far as
what's going on right now,

10:27.833 --> 10:30.133
it, kind of, seems
like a preschool.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.000
Whole bunch of rowdy kids on

10:32.033 --> 10:35.067
just about
a 15-minute recess,
and got to go play,

10:35.100 --> 10:38.067
and now we gotta rile them up
to all get back into class.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.267
It's really fun though.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.433
These seem like
the happiest animals
I've ever met.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.033
Come here, Rupe.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.433
CODY: These dogs are
pretty much people here.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.500
I mean, they're just
really hard working people.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.667
They probably work harder
than we do half the time.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.267
I think first thing
tomorrow morning

10:52.300 --> 10:55.067
-I want to start teaching you
how to mush.
-Okay.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.200
Get a good night's
sleep tonight,

10:57.233 --> 10:59.167
and then we'll start
bright and early as soon

10:59.200 --> 11:01.667
as the sun's up tomorrow,
and spend the day dog mushing,

11:01.700 --> 11:03.800
and picking you up
out of the snow.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.900
(BOTH LAUGHING)

11:05.933 --> 11:07.567
ANDY: Everybody's in
their new house!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.000
Oh, boy! New spots.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.367
ERIK: I don't have a boss,
so there's nobody to tell me

11:12.400 --> 11:14.433
I need to do anything
on a given day.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.767
It's all just
being self-motivated

11:17.800 --> 11:19.733
and getting done
whatever needs to get done.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.633
The Brooks Range in Wiseman,
where I live is uh...

11:26.667 --> 11:30.033
The climate is very different
and the terrain
is a lot different.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.633
Trapping is something
that I do commercially,

11:36.667 --> 11:39.500
you know, in the winter
after the guiding season
is over.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.000
I'm ready to spend
a little bit of time
in the woods on my own.

11:43.633 --> 11:46.233
Seen some wolf sign around
and I'm just hoping,

11:46.267 --> 11:48.867
just hoping that I'll be able
to call in a wolf.

11:48.900 --> 11:52.133
NARRATOR: Cooler temperatures
herald the start
of fur-trapping season,

11:52.167 --> 11:54.200
an important source
of income for Erik.

11:54.233 --> 11:56.500
As one of Alaska's
apex predators,

11:56.533 --> 12:00.467
the coat of a wolf
could be worth up to $1500
on the open market.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.333
ERIK: I've got my AR.
I've got my predator call.

12:03.367 --> 12:06.100
I'm gonna head out and see
if I can sneak up into a spot

12:06.133 --> 12:09.200
and set up
and make a good calling set.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.900
So, we'll see what happens.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.233
(ENGINE REVVS UP)

12:24.867 --> 12:26.933
You know, a lot
of people sit in front
of a TV all winter

12:26.967 --> 12:29.733
and, kind of, get fat.
(CHUCKLES)

12:29.767 --> 12:34.600
Hunting fur and calling fur,
it's, kind of, my
little winter obsession

12:34.633 --> 12:38.267
that I beat the blues
of the dark and the cold with.

12:46.033 --> 12:49.167
Wolves are the alpha predators
in the area, except for man,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.400
and they're really
intelligent animals,

12:51.433 --> 12:53.567
and they realise
that men have firearms.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.467
And if I make
any kind of noise
when I make my set,

12:56.500 --> 12:58.133
I won't have any luck.

12:58.167 --> 13:03.133
So, I gotta park the sled,
walk a good distance,
wait awhile, and hopefully,

13:03.167 --> 13:05.300
just hopefully I can get
some wolves in the area.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.333
What the...

13:11.733 --> 13:15.733
NARRATOR: Erik has spotted
a pack of wolves
1,000 yards away.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.267
Each wolf coat
is worth up to $1,500.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.667
If he can make the shot,

13:20.700 --> 13:23.167
this could be his
most rewarding
haul of the season.

13:33.533 --> 13:34.700
(GUNSHOT FIRING)

13:37.067 --> 13:38.233
(GUNSHOT FIRING)

13:43.200 --> 13:44.200
(GUNSHOT FIRING)

13:58.800 --> 14:00.600
One thousand yards, man.

14:02.167 --> 14:05.367
Not having a whole lot of luck
with the wolves, this year.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.900
Seem to hit everything else
just fine.

14:07.933 --> 14:13.267
Wolves zero for,
I'd rather not say.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.200
I'm gonna hop
back on the Snow-Go
and keep on rolling.

14:23.033 --> 14:26.633
CHIP: Where I live and
how I live, the weather
rules everything.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.600
Knowing your weather
and how to work
around your weather

14:28.633 --> 14:32.567
is really important here,
and it's one of the skills
me and my wife both have.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.733
CHIP: This is frozen
beyond belief.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.467
AGNES: I'm just gonna try
to see if we could
untangle it a little bit.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.033
Where's the end? Right here?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.033
Oh, man!

14:55.067 --> 14:58.233
The bottom is frozen!
Look like ice-hard.

14:58.267 --> 15:00.367
CHIP: This is iced-up
from being rained on.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.067
NARRATOR: A late freeze
has delayed the Hailstones'
ice-fishing harvest.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.500
In the hope the river
is safe enough
to fish tomorrow,

15:06.533 --> 15:09.533
thawing the 150-foot net
is top priority.

15:11.167 --> 15:14.800
If we take it,
put it in a shed,
close the outside door,

15:14.833 --> 15:17.500
build a big fire,
and thaw out the bottom,

15:17.533 --> 15:19.700
it'll just feed right out
real easy.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.767
-You know what I mean?
-AGNES: Yeah.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.400
Well, you know,
when we put these things away

15:23.433 --> 15:25.367
we put them away
in a fairly organised manner,

15:25.400 --> 15:28.200
and we roll the tarps up
and protect them
as best as we can,

15:28.233 --> 15:31.133
but when we went to get it,
we come to find out

15:31.167 --> 15:33.900
that the continuous rains
that happened until freeze-up

15:33.933 --> 15:37.567
had leaked enough in here
that there's couple of inches
of ice on the bottom.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.733
And it has
all the webbing
froze together.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.800
So, there's no way
we can stretch this thing out
without damaging it.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.300
So, we're gonna thaw it,

15:44.333 --> 15:46.300
and then we'll be able to
stretch it out
and do our thing.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.833
You ready to work, son?

15:48.933 --> 15:51.133
AGNES: All together.
One, two, three, go!

15:54.267 --> 15:57.200
One, two, three, go!

15:57.233 --> 15:59.400
(CHUCKLING) Wait,
we're not pulling together.

15:59.433 --> 16:01.967
CHIP: Probably, weighs
about 800-900 pounds.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.133
Feels like we're trying
to lift a snow machine.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.800
AGNES: One, two, three.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.067
One, two, three, roll!
(GRUNTING)

16:09.100 --> 16:11.133
It always helps
to have a big family.

16:11.167 --> 16:14.200
Cousins, sons,
daughters, wives.

16:14.967 --> 16:16.067
(SQUEAKING)

16:16.100 --> 16:17.567
MAN: (GRUNTING)
I got it. I got it.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.167
If I needed to I could call
on my neighbours around here.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.567
They'd help me
as soon as I'd help them.
No problem.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.200
-AGNES: Go help
with your dad, Jon.
-I got it, I'm doing good.

16:25.233 --> 16:26.267
Okay.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.100
You guys just try
lifting this way.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.900
-(GRUNTING) Okay.
-There we go.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.833
One, two, three, go!

16:31.867 --> 16:33.967
-Oh, yeah.
-Keep going. Keep going.

16:35.033 --> 16:36.267
(PANTING)

16:36.300 --> 16:38.700
-Up, up, up, up.
-I'm lifting. Lifting.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.267
There you go.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.533
-Here it comes.
-(SQUEALING)

16:43.733 --> 16:45.333
Come on in, my blob.

16:45.367 --> 16:46.367
-(PANTING)
-(AGNES CHUCKLING)

16:47.767 --> 16:49.900
-Oh, thank goodness.
-CHIP: Is it in?

16:49.933 --> 16:51.300
AGNES: Not enough
to close the door.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.667
CHIP: Just put
an old sleeping bag up.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.600
-(HAMMERING)
-AGNES: On this side.

16:56.967 --> 16:59.267
This work we're doing
takes a lot of energy.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.933
So, we like to eat
real good food.

17:01.967 --> 17:04.467
So, the real good food
right now is under the ice,

17:04.500 --> 17:06.767
and hopefully by morning
it will be thawed out,

17:06.800 --> 17:08.633
and we'll go
throw it out there.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.533
And by then the ice
should be thick enough,

17:10.567 --> 17:15.467
and then I'll get
a sled-load of fish,
couple hundred fish hopefully,

17:15.500 --> 17:22.633
and be set
for the real extreme cold
with fish 'til springtime.

17:22.667 --> 17:27.067
ANDY: It takes imagination,
determination,
and follow through.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.967
Those three things
usually will get you by
out here.

17:36.867 --> 17:40.467
Okay, Cody, so today
we're gonna do
your first dog mushing lesson.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.433
-You ready for it?
-I think so. I hope so.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.833
-No, I know so! There you go.
-I know so. I know so.

17:45.867 --> 17:48.000
I'm gonna give you
the basics today.

17:48.033 --> 17:51.267
For a lot of people,
the first time you do this
it's pretty intimidating.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.467
They don't realise
how much power and speed
the dogs have.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
It takes about
one hundred miles of mushing

17:56.533 --> 17:59.367
to really get a good feel
of what you're doing.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.267
The most important thing
to remember is just
try and be relaxed.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.800
Especially this year
with no snow,
the sled's gonna move a lot.

18:05.833 --> 18:09.200
It's gonna bounce
this way and that way,
and you need to let it do it.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.867
Don't go with it completely.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.400
If it happens, it happens.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.700
-The important thing
is you don't get hurt, right?
-Okay.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.033
Well, here's
to not falling off.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.833
Well, if you've never
fallen off a dog sled,

18:18.867 --> 18:20.333
you've never driven
a dog sled.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.600
We're gonna go out
and run around,

18:22.633 --> 18:26.100
go through some woods trails,
go out onto the lake,
run around the lake.

18:26.133 --> 18:29.267
Just give you
your first introduction to it.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.833
You're gonna have
a four-dog team,

18:30.867 --> 18:34.900
so you're only gonna
have a sled, two wheel dogs,
a swing dog.

18:34.933 --> 18:38.267
-Okay.
-And then your lead dog
in front of you.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.667
-Okay.
-This is Tia. (CHUCKLES)

18:40.700 --> 18:43.567
She's a pretty good lead dog.
She's pretty steady.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.133
It's gonna take her
a little bit
to get to know you.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.533
So, we're gonna take Topaz
as your swing dog.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.767
Come here, Tope. Come, yeah.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.600
Yeah, you can see
she's really...
She's really not very shy.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.900
So, then let's go get
your wheel dogs here.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.367
Gilligan is
extremely excitable.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.367
He'll tune into you
pretty quick I think.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.233
He's kind of a soft head,
but he's a really nice dog.

19:05.267 --> 19:10.567
And then we'll take Alt,
and Alt is this big fat boy
over here.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.300
Attaboy.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.267
He's, kind of, what I call
the no-nonsense dog.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.067
Yeah, seems like
everybody else
is all riled up,

19:18.100 --> 19:19.800
-and he was just
chilling in his house.
-Yeah.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.867
This'll be a really nice
beginner team for you,

19:22.900 --> 19:25.800
and then as you get
better and better
we'll just add some more dogs

19:25.833 --> 19:28.733
or maybe go
to some little bit
higher-powered dogs.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.867
-Okay?
-Okay.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.067
I'll take care of you
if you take care of me.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.667
(DOGS BARKING AND HOWLING)

19:38.700 --> 19:40.500
Go ahead
and take the coat off first.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.267
Undo the chain.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.200
And then that has to come up
through the neck part.

19:49.233 --> 19:53.000
-So, on the backside
or the front?
-No, the front, so it's free.

19:53.033 --> 19:56.467
There you go.
I've given Cody a hell of
a lot of information.

19:56.500 --> 20:01.167
I think he'll do well.
I expect to see him lose it
a couple of times.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.333
If he doesn't, all the better,

20:03.367 --> 20:08.100
but most people
do the first couple of days
that they mush.

20:08.767 --> 20:09.867
That's upside down.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.633
Just right off the bat
it's a lot to take in
all at once,

20:14.667 --> 20:17.300
and when he starts, kind of,
talking about
what I have to do

20:17.333 --> 20:19.233
if I get
knocked off a sled, or...

20:19.267 --> 20:20.800
I mean, I'm, kind of, nervous.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.267
Just because,
I mean, these are
Andy and Kate's babies,

20:23.300 --> 20:26.167
and they're trusting me
to go out with them.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.733
And there's a lot
that could go wrong,

20:28.767 --> 20:31.133
but it seems, like,
with everything Andy told me,

20:31.167 --> 20:34.600
as long as I can, kind of,
keep it somewhat in order,
I'll be okay out there.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.800
There you go. Just go
and just walk her over there.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.167
Or maybe she'll walk you
over there.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.533
Thank you
for being so cooperative.

20:45.567 --> 20:48.700
All your brothers and sisters
are a pain-in-the-butt.
You know that?

20:50.467 --> 20:52.567
It's a mad house!

20:52.600 --> 20:54.700
Okay, let's go.
Up, up. Let's go.

20:55.933 --> 20:58.433
It's my first time ever
on a dog sled.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.933
First time, you know,
on a sled in general.

21:00.967 --> 21:03.900
I don't know
how's it's gonna go,
but let's see what happens.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.233
Easy.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
Whoop.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.800
Straight ahead.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.300
This is my first time ever
on a dog sled.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.433
Something new to me.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.333
Any time you're moving
over 10 mph,

21:21.367 --> 21:23.467
and you got trees
all around you,

21:23.500 --> 21:24.700
you keep it in
the back of your head

21:24.733 --> 21:26.667
that you could run
into one of those very easy,

21:26.700 --> 21:31.000
and without hospitals around
small injuries
can become big things.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.833
Whoa, whoa.

21:33.867 --> 21:35.467
-Easy, easy.
-ANDY: Come on!

21:35.500 --> 21:36.900
I got a tangle.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.033

-Topaz decided
to take a poop halfway.
-ANDY: Yeah.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.633
And then Gilligan decided
to tangle his arm
over the yellow line.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.867
ANDY: Yeah. I know.
Topaz is famous for that.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.067
(CHUCKLES)

21:52.100 --> 21:54.367
-ANDY: We need about
a foot of snow.
-Yeah.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.200
That'd probably
make everything
a little bit softer.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.900
It gets real good
if you get some snow on it.
This is pretty rough.

21:59.933 --> 22:02.333
You gotta let the sled
just move underneath of you.

22:02.367 --> 22:05.067
If you go with the sled
it just throws you right off.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.000
CODY: Okay, why don't you
get on your sled,

22:08.033 --> 22:11.533
and we'll pull on out there
and get back on the track.
Chi-chi.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.433
CODY: Life begins at the end
of your comfort zone,

22:24.467 --> 22:26.833
and if you're sitting
comfortable somewhere

22:26.867 --> 22:29.633
you just get complacent,
bored, lazy.

22:29.667 --> 22:32.300
But when you get out
to something like this,

22:32.333 --> 22:36.300
if you're pushing yourself
every day to survive
and keep yourself going,

22:36.333 --> 22:39.033
and to me it's amazing.

22:39.533 --> 22:40.533
ANDY: Good G.

22:41.533 --> 22:42.533
Good boy.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.367
Ooh!

22:46.167 --> 22:48.500
All right, good boys.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.900
Let's see how Cody does.

22:52.733 --> 22:56.800
(LAUGHS) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Good spot.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.833
Go give them all
a pat on the head.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.033
-(CHUCKLES)
-(HOWLING)

23:03.567 --> 23:05.000
All right.

23:05.033 --> 23:07.267
We did our first run today
with Cody.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.300
Everything went
pretty darn good actually.

23:09.333 --> 23:12.167
He was picking it up
pretty quick.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.833
All in all, a first good run,
but you know, dog mushing,

23:15.867 --> 23:17.600
it's one thing
when you're following someone

23:17.633 --> 23:19.600
and the dogs are just
going down the trail.

23:19.633 --> 23:22.300
It's a totally different
ball game when you're
out on your own.

23:22.333 --> 23:27.767
So, I think probably
the next thing for him to do
is to take a little team out,

23:27.800 --> 23:30.267
and, kind of, do the same run
that we did today,

23:30.300 --> 23:33.600
and just see
how he does on his own.

23:34.867 --> 23:37.067
-Yeah. I'm gonna put you up.
-(BARKS)

23:37.867 --> 23:39.567
SUE: There are challenges here

23:39.600 --> 23:43.967
that there are no longer
in the rest of the
contiguous United States.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.200
If you want to test yourself,
no matter what
your personality,

23:47.233 --> 23:48.867
there's an area of Alaska
that will do it.

24:01.067 --> 24:03.033
BOB (OVER RADIO):
Nine, five, delta, go for Sue.

24:04.967 --> 24:06.200
Hey, Bob!

24:06.233 --> 24:08.400
(SPEAKING OVER RADIO)

24:08.433 --> 24:10.867
All right, I'll see you
in a minute.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.000
BOB: (OVER RADIO) Okay.

24:12.433 --> 24:15.233
(REVERBERATING)

24:15.267 --> 24:17.367
SUE: That's an
awesome surprise.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.767
I get a mail delivery
once every few months,

24:19.800 --> 24:21.567
and this time of year
I don't expect it 'til June.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.500
So, this is pretty cool.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.433
(WHIRRING)

24:34.167 --> 24:36.100
-Hey, hi there!
-BOB: Sue! Hey!

24:36.133 --> 24:38.467
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. How are you?

24:38.500 --> 24:40.200
How's life at Kavik?

24:40.233 --> 24:41.800
It's okay, getting cool again.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.767
I mean, it's nowhere near
as what it should be.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.367
It's been one hell
of a warm winter.
Weird winter so far.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.667
It's nice and cold today.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.367
-It's getting there.
-Arctic Coastal Plane.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.500
-I got you a bunch of stuff.
-Cool!

24:51.533 --> 24:54.167
SUE: I wasn't
expecting Bob today.
So, that's pretty cool.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.367
It's cleared up.
It's pretty nice.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.933
And while he's here
I'm gonna ask him to see

24:58.967 --> 25:00.500
if he can't get me
up in the air

25:00.533 --> 25:03.400
for doing a perimeter check
on my predators.

25:05.267 --> 25:06.967
NARRATOR: The unusual
weather could be affecting

25:07.000 --> 25:09.667
the migration patterns
of predators in the area.

25:11.567 --> 25:15.633
But the clear skies afford
her the opportunity to scout
dangers from above.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.733
SUE: I'm pretty interested.
It's been unseasonably warm.

25:20.767 --> 25:22.200
It's getting cooler today,

25:22.233 --> 25:25.233
but it'll be interesting
just to get a bird's eye view

25:25.267 --> 25:27.667
of what's going on
in my neck of the tundra.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.433
(SUE TALKING)

25:43.233 --> 25:44.900

(BOB TALKING)

(SUE TALKING)

26:10.867 --> 26:11.933
Oh, wow.

26:11.967 --> 26:13.567
Bob, look down there.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.733
What do you got?

26:14.767 --> 26:17.100
I got, it looks
like polar bears.

26:17.133 --> 26:18.200
(BOB TALKING)

26:18.233 --> 26:20.067
(SUE TALKING)

27:38.200 --> 27:43.100
SUE: So, yeah, I'll have to
definitely stay aware
for a little while longer.

27:43.133 --> 27:44.733
I mean, to see
the polar bears that close,

27:44.767 --> 27:46.867
I mean, that's not
even thirty miles away.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.667
I mean, hell, they can
swim sixty miles a day.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.400
That's definitely
a real threat to my area.

27:56.567 --> 28:01.233
ERIK: As somebody who's
dedicated their whole life
to hunting and guiding,

28:01.267 --> 28:03.600
there really is no more
exhilarating moment

28:03.633 --> 28:06.733
than when you're reflecting
on the hunt you just completed

28:06.767 --> 28:10.267
and you have another
just irreplaceable experience

28:10.300 --> 28:12.033
that you just lived
in the outdoors.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.633
NARRATOR: At fifteen
hundred dollars apiece,

28:17.667 --> 28:20.767
wolf fur is a crucial
source of income for Erik.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.733
While he's come up
empty thus far,

28:22.767 --> 28:24.533
his luck takes
a fortunate turn

28:24.567 --> 28:27.233
when he spots a lone
wolf just off his trail.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.833
There's a wolf right there.

28:29.867 --> 28:31.267
Sitting down on
the ice right there.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.633
I knew I heard a wolf
howl down there.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.300
It's about 700-800 yards away,

28:35.333 --> 28:37.367
but I think
I can cut the distance,

28:37.400 --> 28:38.900
put that berm
in between me and him

28:38.933 --> 28:40.733
and get a 400-500 yard shot.

28:41.967 --> 28:44.300
Looks like a big male.
Nice, grey wolf.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.400
I'm gonna go for it.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.633
I've snuck up here as
close as I dare go
without spooking him.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.733
It's about a 450-yard shot.

29:04.767 --> 29:07.467
He's kinda obscured
behind a little knob here.

29:07.500 --> 29:10.533
So, all I need him to do
is move just a few feet
in either direction,

29:10.567 --> 29:12.433
come out from behind
that little river bank,

29:12.467 --> 29:14.900
and then he'll be
exposed for a shot.

29:14.933 --> 29:16.433
I'm hoping
I can pull this off.

29:18.167 --> 29:19.833
Here he goes.
He's moving right now.

29:25.767 --> 29:27.067
(FIRES GUN)

29:30.500 --> 29:31.633
(FIRES GUN)

29:35.867 --> 29:37.067
(FIRES GUN)

29:43.800 --> 29:44.967
He's down.

29:47.767 --> 29:51.567
ERIK: Definitely some hard
earned, uh, satisfaction here.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.200
Really gratifying
to, uh, to get a wolf down

29:55.233 --> 29:57.333
and feel like I really
got something done.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.667
What we have
here is basically
the symbol of wilderness.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.233
Even though I believe very
strongly in predator control,

30:08.267 --> 30:11.500
it's always a mixed emotion
for me whenever
I kill a wolf like this.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.200
I mean, they're beautiful.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.233
The first shot, I caught
him a little far back
and slowed him up.

30:17.267 --> 30:20.667
Second shot, I hit him
right here in the neck
and killed him instantly.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.433
I'm gonna load
this wolf up in my sled,
and head back home,

30:25.467 --> 30:26.633
and get him skinned out.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.933
This is the sixth wolf
that I've seen since
trapping season opened,

30:31.967 --> 30:33.433
and the first one
I've harvested.

30:33.467 --> 30:36.867
So, after a lot of heartbreak
over the last few days,

30:36.900 --> 30:38.800
finally came right
with this big male.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.700
Of all the thousands
of days in my life
that I spend in the outdoors,

30:45.733 --> 30:47.833
it's the days that
I just get to see wolves,

30:47.867 --> 30:49.600
let alone be fortunate
enough to harvest one,

30:49.633 --> 30:52.267
that I think I'll remember
up in my later years.

30:56.867 --> 30:58.900
CODY: Everything
cycles in life

30:58.933 --> 31:00.867
and in generation
to generation.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.600
And I'm hoping we can get back
to a cycle where people try

31:03.633 --> 31:05.500
and become
a little more self-sufficient.

31:12.733 --> 31:13.967
All right.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.067
There's Tia.

31:18.300 --> 31:19.500
There's Topaz.

31:19.533 --> 31:23.167
Ah, today's a big day
for me. (SNIFFLES)

31:23.200 --> 31:27.900
I'm, uh, taking a team
out by myself.

31:27.933 --> 31:29.533
Andy's, kinda, wanting me
to build the confidence

31:29.567 --> 31:30.800
a little bit more
with the dogs,

31:30.833 --> 31:33.433
and get a little bit better
relationship with them.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.667
And, kinda, see how I do
out there on my own.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.267
With how cold it is out today
compared to the last time,

31:38.300 --> 31:40.733
I gotta kinda be on
my game a little bit.

31:40.767 --> 31:44.167
Some of the coldest
temps it's been
since I've been out here.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.900
I'm excited and scared
at the same time. (LAUGHS)

31:46.933 --> 31:49.167
I just want to go
get this started
and see how it goes.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.333
This is why you're a lead dog,

brothers and sisters
going crazy out there.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.367

31:59.400 --> 32:01.667
Hey! You're already
back over here?

32:01.700 --> 32:02.967

32:03.000 --> 32:04.733
Tighten up. Go. Tighten up.

Stay. Stay.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.500
Tia, stay.

32:11.533 --> 32:13.700
You're gonna make this
difficult on me, aren't you?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.500
I'll be back.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.767
Okay.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.967
You are gonna stay
calm and not drag me
across the whole yard.

they're going crazy.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.000
The last time
I went dog mushing

33:16.033 --> 33:18.700
it was one of
the greatest things
I've ever done in my life,

33:18.733 --> 33:21.533
but it was also
really comforting to have
Andy out there with me.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.700
Whoa, shit.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.067
I'm really worried.
I don't want
anything to go wrong.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.600
Like, you know,
I don't want to
get lost out there.

33:28.633 --> 33:30.500
And I don't want
the dogs, you know,

33:30.533 --> 33:32.767
getting scared or
something just happening.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
I mean, anything can
happen out there.

Come on, guys! Mush! Mush!

33:46.667 --> 33:48.800
Oh! Good dogs.

33:48.833 --> 33:51.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.467
Everybody okay?

33:57.533 --> 33:59.667
First run coming
out to the lake,

33:59.700 --> 34:01.000
I had a little bit of an issue

34:01.033 --> 34:04.833
where I think I just
had the wrong lean
coming up over a hill,

34:04.867 --> 34:06.967
and felt everything
going over.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.367
And instead of
trying to save it
I kinda just ditched off

34:10.400 --> 34:12.733
into the soft snow hoping
everything would be okay.

34:12.767 --> 34:14.567
And jumped right back up

34:14.600 --> 34:17.633
and the dogs actually
kind of stopped
and waited for me.

34:17.667 --> 34:21.633
I was kinda surprised by that.
I thought they were gonna
be gone when I looked up.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.400
Today's quite a bit colder
than last time we were out.

34:24.433 --> 34:27.167
I can definitely feel it
on my face when we're going.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.267
But there's no wind out.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.067
It's just mainly that
negative frostbite feeling.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.100
Yeah, all you want
to do is play.

34:36.133 --> 34:39.667
Hopefully, I can figure out
where I got in here.

34:39.700 --> 34:43.033
I mean, there's plenty
of snow so I can probably
just track my trail back.

34:43.067 --> 34:45.333
So, we're gonna try
and get around the lake

34:45.367 --> 34:48.467
and get these guys
some exercise.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.800
Yeah, we'll go from there.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.967

up here a little bit,

35:01.767 --> 35:04.100
and I don't know if I'll be
able to get them undone

without unhooking
one or two here.

freak me out here.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.400
Let's go! Come on, Tia!

35:21.833 --> 35:23.600
Little haw! Little haw!

35:23.633 --> 35:25.567
Little haw, Tia! Let's go!

35:25.600 --> 35:26.667
Let's go!

35:26.700 --> 35:28.233
Come on, Tia! Let's go!

35:28.267 --> 35:30.600
You got it, Tia!
Come on, good girl!

35:31.733 --> 35:34.200
Tighten up, Tia! Gee, gee!

35:34.233 --> 35:36.267
Little gee!
Little gee! Little gee!

35:36.300 --> 35:37.667
Where you go?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.667
Mush! Mush!

35:41.667 --> 35:43.033
Come on! Let's go!

35:44.867 --> 35:46.700
Let's go! Let's go!

35:49.933 --> 35:51.633
Almost home! Almost home!

35:51.667 --> 35:52.967
Let's go!

35:53.000 --> 35:54.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:57.533 --> 36:01.867
Well, first trip out
there by myself,

36:01.900 --> 36:06.200
and it's definitely
a lot different
being out by myself,

36:06.233 --> 36:07.567
without Andy out there.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.433
These dogs are not machines.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.567
They don't just
respond to any command

36:11.600 --> 36:13.133
or any button push
that you give them.

36:13.167 --> 36:15.667
They each got their own
individual personalities

36:15.700 --> 36:18.133
and it's definitely gonna
take some more time
getting to know them

36:18.167 --> 36:20.633
and getting to know them
out on the trail a bit more

36:20.667 --> 36:23.933
before we all, kinda,
get settled in together.

36:23.967 --> 36:27.433
That was just about
the hardest freaking day
I've had out here so far.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.733
(SIGHS)

36:28.767 --> 36:31.100
It's all part of the life.

36:31.133 --> 36:36.567
But for sure I'm glad
to be back safe
and sound with them.

36:39.133 --> 36:40.467
There you go.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.800
CHIP: Subsistence living to
me is my ability to go out

36:44.833 --> 36:49.367
and get the materials
I need to feed, eat, clothe,
and make money from.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.600
And these folks around here
know how to do things
to make a good living.

36:52.633 --> 36:54.667
It's not survival,
it's living.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.100
Honda's warmed up.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.067
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

37:02.100 --> 37:04.700
Warmed up and in
first gear! (LAUGHS)

37:04.733 --> 37:07.200
We're gonna go
check out the ice
and see if it's safe enough

37:07.233 --> 37:08.467
to get out and put a net on.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.300
I know it'll bear our weight,
I know we can walk out on it.

37:11.333 --> 37:13.333
But that doesn't mean we can
make a pile of fish on it

37:13.367 --> 37:15.633
or take 700 or 800
pounds of net on it.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.700
And if that ain't happening,
then we certainly ain't
bringing our kids out on it.

37:18.733 --> 37:21.833
So, we're just gonna make sure
it's safe the way we know how.

37:21.867 --> 37:25.533
NARRATOR: Ice fishing is
crucial to the Hailstone's
winter trade stock.

37:25.567 --> 37:27.500
But a late freeze
of the Kobuk River

37:27.533 --> 37:30.133
has so far prevented
the family from cashing in.

37:30.167 --> 37:33.300
If you don't do things right,
you're gonna end up dying.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.333
If we don't know
how to check the ice

37:35.367 --> 37:36.733
and we don't know
what the thickness is,

37:36.767 --> 37:39.467
and the dangers are,
we could get killed.

37:39.500 --> 37:42.200
If you don't do it correctly,
you just get removed
from the gene pool.

37:43.533 --> 37:45.267
CHIP: Even if we have to
wait an extra day,

37:45.300 --> 37:47.033
instead of running
just a 50-foot net

37:47.067 --> 37:49.567
and getting a potential
of 10 or 20 fish
for ourselves,

37:49.600 --> 37:52.533
we're trying to run
at least 100, 150 foot net.

37:52.567 --> 37:56.333
And we're gonna try
to get enough, enough fish
that we're secure.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.767
Then we'll be able to
trade fish all winter.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.933
So, it's gonna be
more than just
a personal fishery,

38:00.967 --> 38:03.300
it's gonna have a lot to do
with being able to trade.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.633
It's gonna have a lot
to be able to do
with giving away.

38:05.667 --> 38:07.133
And it's gonna have
a lot to do with us eating.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.533
AGNES: What it look like?
Four inches?

38:12.567 --> 38:14.667
This stuff's okay,
but over here is worse.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.067
Thinner, thinner, thinner.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.567
I'm going all the
way through, Agnes.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.533
Two inches of ice.

38:20.567 --> 38:21.767
Whoa! Fuck that.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.300
Oh, fuck. Same deal.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.767
The snow cover
that we had here

38:26.800 --> 38:28.833
didn't allow this ice
to thicken so well.

38:28.867 --> 38:30.000
See, it's just water.

38:30.033 --> 38:31.500
The thing is
it just gets thinner

38:31.533 --> 38:33.567
as we head out
towards the centre
of the river.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.867
This is thin ice, Agnes.

38:39.667 --> 38:41.567
Whoa! Fuck that!

38:43.533 --> 38:45.067
AGNES: I don't really
like going on the ice,

38:45.100 --> 38:46.800
but it's something
I have to do.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.733
And it's been 21
years and three weeks

38:49.767 --> 38:52.533
since my mother went out
fishing her last time.

38:52.567 --> 38:53.700
We ran two nets.

38:53.733 --> 38:55.800
We had one here
and we had one further up.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.633
And me, my dad,
and my younger sister,

38:57.667 --> 39:00.233
we were just like five miles
away from each other.

39:00.267 --> 39:01.667
And they were
on their way back

39:01.700 --> 39:04.300
from the fishing hole
and this old man,

39:04.333 --> 39:06.600
he comes cruising along
the edge and he's like,

39:06.633 --> 39:10.600
"Some people
fell through the ice,
and I don't know who it is."

39:10.633 --> 39:12.667
And then I was like,
"What the hell?"

39:12.700 --> 39:14.733
And then I thought
for a minute,
and I turned around,

39:14.767 --> 39:17.467
and I went back up
to the house and I
say, "Where's my mom?

39:17.500 --> 39:19.833
"Where's my brother?
Did they get back yet?"

39:19.867 --> 39:22.700
And they were like,
"No, they never came back,
they're still out fishing."

39:22.733 --> 39:24.700
And right there
I fucking knew it.

39:25.900 --> 39:29.033
And my brother
was right under my mom

39:29.067 --> 39:32.467
and we never did find
my brother's girlfriend.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.233
My mom taught me to be tough.
My mom taught me to be strong.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.767
Try not to show my fear
to my younger girls,

39:38.800 --> 39:41.333
but I caution them and
I tell them to always know

39:41.367 --> 39:44.400
the safety in their
surrounding areas where
they're working at.

39:44.433 --> 39:48.067
And always be safe
because even though
you think it's safe,

39:48.100 --> 39:51.833
and you go over it yesterday,
and the day before,
and the day before,

39:51.867 --> 39:53.667
it's still not safe.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.867
So it's just
a scary fucking thing.

39:56.900 --> 39:59.100
I don't fuck around
when it comes to ice.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.767
Yesterday, we didn't
even go out this far.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.267
We were just along the edge.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.433
CHIP: It's safe to walk on.

40:08.467 --> 40:10.833
It's not safe to
take a lot of weight.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.567
If we're gonna have
several people here,

40:12.600 --> 40:14.533
we're gonna have
a net that weighs
several hundred pounds,

40:14.567 --> 40:16.700
and we're gonna bring out
several hundred pounds of fish

40:16.733 --> 40:18.933
along with the net
all into the same place

40:18.967 --> 40:21.767
where we're all
working together,
this is gonna be a disaster.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.233
So we're not gonna
put a net in.

40:23.267 --> 40:26.033
Nothing we want
to do today.
That's for sure.

40:26.067 --> 40:27.667
Sometimes, this is what
nature does to you.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.833
Sometimes these things happen.
You don't get a choice.

40:29.867 --> 40:30.933
You just roll with it.

40:30.967 --> 40:32.067
I think we're just
gonna have to wait

40:32.100 --> 40:33.800
and hope that the good
weather comes back.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.500
It's just, kinda, like
going to the store

40:35.533 --> 40:38.467
and not being able
to find lettuce when
you really crave a salad.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.967
Ice fishing this year
just isn't a happening deal.

40:42.767 --> 40:43.900
Water!

40:46.067 --> 40:48.667
ANDY: If you spend one year
in the bush up here,

40:48.700 --> 40:51.000
you will learn
more about yourself
in that one year

40:51.033 --> 40:54.700
than you will
in a lifetime of living
where there's distractions,

40:54.733 --> 40:57.467
and compromises,
and all these
other things in life.

41:02.533 --> 41:05.267
CODY: Okay, something smells
kinda fishy over here.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.500
KATE: You think
it could be fish?

41:07.533 --> 41:09.267
You can take one
and I'll take another.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.767
All right. Ten fish.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.333
I remember holding up
six one time and holy cow.

41:13.367 --> 41:15.533
-Is it heavy?
-Yeah, a little bit.

41:15.567 --> 41:18.400
Of course, you're gonna
take that one and make me
look like a wuss, aren't you?

41:18.433 --> 41:19.667
(KATE LAUGHS)

41:22.633 --> 41:25.367
So, how are you connecting
with the dogs do you feel?

41:25.400 --> 41:28.267
That's one thing
I really have to say is
like when I was falling off

41:28.300 --> 41:30.267
I wasn't even trying
to "Whoa" the dogs.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.233
I was just, like,
"Whoa, whoa, I'm falling!"

41:32.267 --> 41:34.033
And I was up in a heartbeat
thinking I was gonna be

41:34.067 --> 41:38.767
chasing dogs for miles
down the lake, but no,
she stopped right away.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.000
That's one thing
I noticed with Tia.

41:40.033 --> 41:41.567
She's always
looking back at me.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.467
Like, it always, kind of,
calms me a little bit.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.800
It's like,
as much as I feel like

41:44.833 --> 41:46.100
I'm taking care
of them out there,

41:46.133 --> 41:48.733
they were really making
sure to take care of me.

41:48.767 --> 41:51.133
We've had a lot
of clients come and go,

41:51.167 --> 41:53.633
and there's not
a lot of people
that you would trust

41:53.667 --> 41:57.233
to actually take your
dogs and go alone.

41:57.267 --> 42:01.067
Cody's been one of those
that you, you know...

42:01.100 --> 42:05.600
I got a deep down feeling
in my gut that that boy's
got what it takes.

42:06.467 --> 42:08.500
Okay, guys! Who wants fish?

42:10.767 --> 42:11.800
Sit!

42:11.833 --> 42:14.167
Hey, good job today,
buddy. Good job.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.000
You earned that.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.400
Who gets one?
Who's still hungry?

42:18.433 --> 42:21.333
People refer to a dog
as man's best friend
all the time

42:21.367 --> 42:23.767
and I don't think
they truly know
what that means.

42:23.800 --> 42:28.633
I mean, these aren't just
sled dogs they're a family,

42:28.667 --> 42:33.667
and I kinda look at
them more and more
as people every day.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.200
Okay. I want you to be
very quiet now, Cody.

42:46.633 --> 42:49.100
That's the sound
of a lot of happy dogs.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.933
Right now, I don't know
if words can really
express how I feel.

42:55.767 --> 42:58.233
I mean, I'm 26 years old.

42:58.267 --> 43:01.433
I spent a good portion
of the last ten years,

43:01.467 --> 43:06.800
kinda trying to figure out
(SNIFFLING) who I am,
what I'm supposed to do.

43:06.833 --> 43:08.367
Coming out here,
I thought it was just gonna be

43:08.400 --> 43:11.167
a really hard
substinence lifestyle,

43:11.200 --> 43:16.367
but I'm coming to find out
it's something I feel
like I was born to do.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.700
I love this.

43:18.733 --> 43:22.867
I mean, there is absolutely
nothing else I'd rather
be doing right now.

43:25.300 --> 43:28.733
I don't think I'm ever
going to be able to
call anywhere else home.
