<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:11.400 --> 00:14.051
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:17.446
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

00:17.600 --> 00:19.568
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

00:19.760 --> 00:22.161
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

00:22.400 --> 00:23.401
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

00:23.600 --> 00:26.604
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

00:26.800 --> 00:29.485

CISCO: Previously on The Flash...

00:33.920 --> 00:35.809
The Philosopher's Stone has been
the key to everything.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.083
So we destroy the stone
and Savitar is gone for good.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.760
There's only one thing we can do with it.
Throw it into the Speed Force.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.007
I have to do what I can to help.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.527
I'm the guy
who avoided his dying mother for weeks.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.125
I have a whole lot to make up for.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.288
I like you, Julian,
but I'm also afraid of my powers

00:49.520 --> 00:51.921
<i>and what they could do to anyone
who gets close to me.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:55.681
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.809
I think we should be terrified together.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.161
Sure, together it is.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.522
It's crazy how fast I've gotten
in such a short time.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.921
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.447
<i>I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar,
you are.</i>

through the ringer today.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.404
"Barry"? Excuse me?

01:36.640 --> 01:40.201
Yeah, I suppose it could be Barry,
or it could be his genius coach

01:40.400 --> 01:43.244
whose sole purpose on this Earth
is milking epic greatness

01:43.480 --> 01:44.641
from those around him.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.365
Thank you very much.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.371
- It could also be Jesse.
-What?

01:49.560 --> 01:51.483
Come on, Wally doesn't wanna get beat
by his girlfriend.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.649
Also, please, just refrain from using
"milk" as a verb from now on, please.

KID FLASH: (OVER COMMUNICATOR)
I'm <i>getting kind</i> of dizzy.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.090
You're supposed to get dizzy, Wallace!

02:03.320 --> 02:05.561
<i>You're supposed to get exhausted
on this route.</i>

02:05.760 --> 02:08.205
It's supposed to simulate the stress
that you're going to feel

02:08.440 --> 02:11.603
when you finally confront Savitar,
so my suggestion to you is,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.205
suck it up, buttercup!

02:13.440 --> 02:14.885
Milking epic greatness.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.161
Yeah. No kidding.

Why don't you take it down
a little, Tiger Mom?

02:18.680 --> 02:19.886
Barry and Jesse are at the final mark.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.247
Get ready.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.921
.21 seconds.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.008
.21. Just fast enough to save Iris
from Savitar.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.801
You did it!

02:51.080 --> 02:52.081
(LAUGHS)

02:52.520 --> 02:53.931
- You did it!
-We did it.

- You did.
-You did it.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.122
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm just happy.

We all are, Wally. We all are.

- Julian! Hi!
-Ah, Caitlin!

03:19.880 --> 03:21.041
- How are you?
-How are you?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.883
Did you come straight from the airport?

03:24.200 --> 03:28.728
Uh, yes, yes. Barry said he had something
to tell me. Is he here?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.803
He'll be here any minute, I'm sure.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.166
- Shall we?
-Yes, we shall.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.646
We shall. (CHUCKLES)

-Juhan.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.648
It's good to see you. Good to see you all.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.007
Jesse, I thought you were
heading back to Earth-2.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.687
I actually decided to stick around
for a little while.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.360
Does anybody know what's going on?

03:52.560 --> 03:54.688
I mean, I've got a mountain of paperwork
back at the office.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.161
No, not the foggiest. I was gonna ask you.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.322
Ah! Welcome home, James.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.531
Can I brew you a proper cup of tea
or a robust pick-me-up for you, mate?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.728
No need. We hit Jitters on the way.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.161
Got everybody something. You guys are...
You're in there somewhere.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.566
I thought you were on a deadline.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.561
I am.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.328
(EXHALES) You ready?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.250
- Foryou.
-Thanks

04:18.360 --> 04:21.682
Okay, what is going on with you two?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.886
- Do you want to?
-Mmm-mmm.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.003
This is all you.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.884
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, man. (LAUGHS)

04:41.560 --> 04:46.885
You did it. This is fantastic.
Well done, Joe. Congratulations.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.443
Dad, say something, please.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.611
My baby girl.

05:03.880 --> 05:09.808

You're marrying the best man I know.

Okay, this cuteness right here,
lcannotn

05:20.080 --> 05:21.605
- Congrats!
-Thanks, man. Thank you.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.128
And speaking of best man--

05:25.840 --> 05:29.083
I'll do it, of course.
When Barry and I first met--

05:29.240 --> 05:32.084
- H.R.
-You mean him. Okay, good.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.921
L...

05:34.120 --> 05:38.250
I'd be honored. Really.
I mean, as long as I can get that plus-one

05:38.480 --> 05:40.005
'cause, you know, me and Gypsy,

05:40.240 --> 05:41.844
we about to tear up
the dance floor for you guys.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.447
- Barr, can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, yeah.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.282
Yeah, I wanted to be sure that you heard
what I said in there.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.925
I couldn't be happier.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.281
Okay, all right.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.128
So why didn't you ask my permission?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.166
I mean, I told you the story

05:59.360 --> 06:03.445
of me asking Francine's dad's permission,
like, 100 times.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.807
At least, yeah. And that's a great story.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.042
But you missed the point?

06:08.280 --> 06:10.442
Yeah. I don't...

06:10.680 --> 06:14.685
it was spontaneous. I knew you'd say yes,
and I wanted to surprise you.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.724
Yo, there's a three-alarm fire
in the Raab building.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.564
Fire department's evacuating it now.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.371
Jesse is a little preoccupied
with the ring, so it's just you and me.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.686
- Okay.
-What are you two waiting for? Go.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.041
Yeah.

-Where is he?

07:24.520 --> 07:27.808
So now Savitar is mind-punking you?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.288
Oh, boy! This never stops never stopping.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.881
- How long has this been going on, Wally?
-Like a week.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.081
A week.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.850
Wally, why didn't you say anything before?

07:37.120 --> 07:40.044
Because I didn't know what this was.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.969
I thought that this was just
maybe in my head, you know?

07:42.160 --> 07:44.128
I wasn't looking at it
like I was keeping it to myself--

07:44.320 --> 07:45.810
That's exactly what you did though, Wally.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.890
You did keep it to yourself, and with
Savitar, that's not something we can do.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.560
- This is Iris' life we're talking about.
-Yes, I know that.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.489
- Do you though, Wally?
-Yes!

07:53.680 --> 07:55.967
- Okay.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

07:56.280 --> 07:58.726
Until now, you only saw him, right?

07:58.920 --> 08:01.161
Yeah, this was the first time
it was physical.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.806
He wasn't there, okay?
You weren't fighting him.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.327
He was messing with your head.
He was all in your mind.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.602
I've been there, done that.
It's miserable.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.968
Okay, why don't I run a brain scan
on Wally,

08:11.160 --> 08:13.561
see if he was similarly affected
to when Julian was possessed.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.883
Yeah, that's fine. Why don't we do that?
Wally shouldn't be in here anyway.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.761
- What?
-Barry, he knows he messed up.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.724
That's not what this is about, okay?
Look, it's...

08:22.920 --> 08:25.321
If Savitar is using Wally the same way
he used Julian,

08:25.560 --> 08:27.005
how do we know he's not spying on us

08:27.200 --> 08:28.201
-through Wally right now?
-(SCOFFS)

08:28.440 --> 08:29.965

08:30.160 --> 08:32.561
How do we know he can't see
and hear everything we're doing?

08:33.559 --> 08:35.528
- Look, you're out.
-I'm out?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.404

-Yeah, you don't sound real sorry.

- What?
-You don't have that movie on this Earth?

08:44.840 --> 08:46.808
- I'll go talk to him.
-Yeah, talk some sense into him.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.690
- All right.
-So what now?

08:48.920 --> 08:53.289
Mmm. Well, we know from the future
that Savitar gets out of wherever he is,

08:53.480 --> 08:55.562
but for now, he's still trapped, so...

08:56.360 --> 08:57.566
I need to talk to him again.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.246
No. I knew you were thinking this,
all right, and I won't do it.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.920
I'm not gonna be
your personal walkie-talkie to him.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.566
Guys, we can't. We don't have the Stone.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.446
Actually, we can.
We still have Savitar's spatial frequency

09:09.640 --> 09:13.406
from when we plugged in Linda Blair here,
so I think we can work without the Stone.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.284
Julian, I'm sorry, man.
We don't really have a choice.

09:15.480 --> 09:20.486
We do have a choice. I have a choice,
and I choose to decline. Sorry.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.366
- We're starting to fray.
-Well, we can't, all right?

09:24.560 --> 09:28.167
Everybody just needs to trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.326
(SIGHS) Come to talk me into it, then?

09:35.520 --> 09:36.567
No.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.322
Barry's lost his bloody mind
if he thinks I'm gonna volunteer to be

09:40.720 --> 09:41.926
abused again.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.690
He's just trying to protect Iris.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.646
We all are! But not like that.

09:49.720 --> 09:54.282
Is the reason you don't wanna do this
because you don't want me to see it?

09:59.280 --> 10:03.001
I just think,
hearing his voice coming out of me,

10:03.240 --> 10:06.449
it just makes it impossible for you
to see me as a normal--

10:06.640 --> 10:07.641
Hey-

10:08.240 --> 10:10.641
I've had somebody else's voice
coming out of my mouth,

10:10.880 --> 10:13.247
and you were still able
to see the real me.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.522
How about trusting
that I can do the same thing?

10:25.600 --> 10:30.970
Sorry. I just wanted to do that
in case you changed your mind later.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.126
Quite all right.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.164
Julian, you're gonna be okay.
You know the drill.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.691
Just let your mind go blank.

- We'll take care of the rest, okay?
-(SIGHS)

10:44.560 --> 10:48.963

once more. Brilliant.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.889
From my perspective, you're the Big Bad.

Stupid.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.286
Still here, pretender?
Still trying to find your place?

11:28.800 --> 11:32.930
I found my place. It's standing here
with these people, against you.

You know, the sad thing is that you live.
You survive my wrath.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.723
The coward. Irony.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.367
Where are you? You said that I trapped you
in the future. Where?

11:44.720 --> 11:49.089
The only place that you could think of,
the only place that could hold me.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.248
How long have you been imprisoned?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.324
Long enough to lose my mind
several times over.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.121
It's only my will that keeps me
on this side of sanity.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.408
You know, it's funny,
when I think of sanity,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.841
I don't necessarily think of Savitar.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.691
Well, that's because you're small, Cisco.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.769
<i>You've always been small.</i>

12:08.280 --> 12:10.647
Reverb told you
that you could've been a god,

12:10.840 --> 12:14.765
but instead you'd rather work
as tech support.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.128
You wanna tell me why we're enemies?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.881
Because we had to be.
Only one of us could live.

12:21.640 --> 12:26.123
You thought that Thawne and Zoom
were your biggest foes, but...

12:26.960 --> 12:28.041
But it's me.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.808
It's always been me, Barry.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.809
Man, what did we ever do to you?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.321
You took everything from me!

12:37.680 --> 12:39.170
I never asked for any of this, Joe.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.689
I am only this way because of you.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.761
All of you.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.281
When do we meet?

12:47.480 --> 12:50.643
Not long now.
You're there when I become who I am.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.283
You're saying I caused you
to get your speed? I created you?

12:54.520 --> 12:58.206
Oh, no, I created myself, Barry.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.521
Only I can bring out my greatness.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.520
Your greatness! Well, you're
still trapped, wherever you are,

13:06.240 --> 13:08.208
and I don't know how you're gonna escape.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.482
I mean, we got rid
of the Philosopher's Stone.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.646
Did we?

13:16.760 --> 13:20.810
I am closer to my freedom
than I have ever been.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.767
Every step, every move that you make,
it only brings me nearer to it.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.164
I only need one more thing.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.050
Man, do you love to hear yourself talk!

I'm sorry that you have to die,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.291
but it's you or me.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.927
And despite your feeble efforts
to change the future, you can't

13:50.120 --> 13:51.929
because I am the future, Flash.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.722
Barry, you've had to suffer
worse than anyone.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.241
I don't know if I can take another one
of those seances.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.171
Anyone else with me?
I almost filled my drawers.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.371
Okay, so other than Savitar taking

14:31.560 --> 14:33.164
"scaring the bejeezus out of us"
to a whole new level,

14:33.360 --> 14:36.091
-did we actually learn anything?
-Please say yes.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.328
Maybe. When I mentioned the Stone,

14:38.560 --> 14:40.562
he questioned whether or not
we'd really gotten rid of it.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.321
We did! We threw it into the Speed Force.
That's like throwing it into outer space.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.488
Maybe we didn't.
I mean, maybe there's more to it.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.761
A second Stone?

14:47.960 --> 14:50.088
Or maybe the Stone that we had
was part of a larger piece.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.800
How about the Acolytes?
Maybe they know something we don't.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.889
- What about that one guy?
-Craig?

14:55.120 --> 14:58.249
Yes, the Acolyte that you dropped in on
when you went all cold?

14:58.440 --> 15:03.571
His car's GPS has him located
somewhere near Mount Buccelato.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.883
Buccelato? That's miles away.
Well, what would they be doing up there?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.366
There's one way to find out.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.891
Talk to us. What do you see?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.681

Yeah, but you said the explosion sent you
to the future.

you know?

16:18.800 --> 16:21.565
(SIGHS) I hate to say it, Barry,

16:21.760 --> 16:23.603
but, after all my years of research,
I've never heard

16:23.800 --> 16:26.804
or come across another box or Stone.
I think this is it.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.486
If that's true, we need to consider
the possibility

16:29.680 --> 16:31.091

21:49.640 --> 21:51.244
Yeah, I understand.

21:51.960 --> 21:56.090
I keep coming back to the thought
that I could be the cause of all this.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.961
What do you mean?

21:58.280 --> 21:59.930

-It's not you.
-it's impossible to tell.

None of us, not even me.

But this time we know who it is.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.281
How?

22:22.240 --> 22:25.801
Because I'm the one who betrayed everyone.

Ever since you threw the box
into the Speed Force.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.006
It's such a small piece.
I didn't think it would really matter.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.846
Why would you even risk it?

22:47.480 --> 22:51.451
Because I thought I could use it
to get rid of my powers.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.682
And? Can you?

22:55.440 --> 22:58.091
I don't know. I haven't been able
to figure out how to use it yet.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.805
Okay, well, look, gang,
I think we can all agree

23:00.000 --> 23:04.005
that this is a simple case of the other
side, the Killer Frost side of Caitlin,

23:04.240 --> 23:05.651
clouding her betterjudgment, so...

23:05.840 --> 23:09.083
No, H.R., this wasn't her. It was me.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.606
I'm really sorry, guys.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.488
Right now, we just need to figure out
where Savitar is.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.765
Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.
How are we gonna do that?

Julian, I mean, we've got to end this,
for everybody's sake.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.881
(SIGHS)

23:46.640 --> 23:48.642
- I'll see you downstairs.
-Oh!

23:49.000 --> 23:50.365
Okay, well, you guys can count me out,
all right?

23:50.560 --> 23:52.722
'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply
of boxers to this planet.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.848
Julian, please.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.841
I should have told you.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.921
I can't believe
you would keep part of that Stone.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.563
Do you not remember
what Savitar had me do with that?

24:06.880 --> 24:09.247
- Yes, I do.
-But you're not concerned, are you?

24:09.680 --> 24:12.081
You just want
your own personal meta-human specialist

24:12.320 --> 24:13.526
to try and find you a cure.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.524
Julian, I don't want these powers.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.728
I can%spend
the rest of my life wondering

24:17.880 --> 24:22.204
if or when I'm gonna lose this battle
and become Killer Frost.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.923
I thought you, more than anyone,
would understand that.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.208
You know what I understand?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.926
I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.446
That's not the only reason.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.723
Yeah, I wish I could believe that.

24:50.360 --> 24:54.410
I heard what happened.
Thought you might need a pick-me-up.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.449

-Smaller problems.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.447
Yeah.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.651
So...

25:12.800 --> 25:15.087
- Do you wanna talk about it?
-I don't know what I want, Dad.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.446
Iris.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.331
Whatever you may be feeling right now
about Barry,

25:19.560 --> 25:21.483
that man does love you.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.005
That kind of love is rare.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.329
Dad, I wish it were that simple.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.443
(CHUCKLES) "Simple".

25:30.760 --> 25:32.250
Look,

25:32.480 --> 25:35.609
only you know what's good for you,

25:35.840 --> 25:40.846
but with the kind of lives
that you two have,

25:41.480 --> 25:43.960
that love between the two of you,

25:44.160 --> 25:49.007
that is the one thing
that should stay simple.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.127
We just wanted to let you know
that we're gonna defeat you.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.367
Unlikely.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.490
You told us that you're trapped,
imprisoned for all eternity.

26:14.680 --> 26:17.684

my future-self locked you up.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.369
All will be revealed soon, Flash.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.326
You will face my wrath.
You will beg for mercy.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.289
And you will get none.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.405
- Did it work?
-(IN NORMAL VOICE) Did it work?

26:38.640 --> 26:44.010
Yeah, we got a hit. It's just that
that hit is all of Central City.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.561
- That's not a hit. The whole city?
-CISCO: Yeah.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.007
God.
Well, can we get a little more specific,

26:49.200 --> 26:51.043
pinpoint a location at least, something?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.850
I think maybe we can get
a little bit more precise,

26:53.040 --> 26:54.530
but I'm gonna have
to give it the old meta-human try.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.207
Okay. It's Iris.
All right, I'll be right back,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.402
but just let me know
if you get anything, all right?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.767
All right.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.441
Hey-

27:20.920 --> 27:22.604
You going somewhere?

27:22.840 --> 27:25.571
Yeah, I just wanna get back
to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.525
Seeing as how you exploded on Barry
in front of everyone,

27:29.720 --> 27:31.245
might wanna wait on it.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.442
Well, the truth had to come out, so...

27:34.240 --> 27:38.086
Yeah, it did, just maybe not that way.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.880
I mean, we all have to help each other,
not point fingers.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.046
You're right. I...

27:47.120 --> 27:50.806
I'll make it up to them. It's just,
this whole thing is messing with my head.

<i>- Don't let it.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.091
When you got your powers,
you were walking down the street.

27:57.320 --> 28:02.451
Me? I touched the Philosopher's Stone.
I got trapped in some cocoon.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.444
I just feel, because of all of that, I...

28:05.760 --> 28:07.410
There's something wrong with me.

28:07.600 --> 28:12.162
I feel like Savitar has
some kind of hold on me.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.001
Look, I know, okay,
but you're strong, Wally.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.605
You can fight this.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.969
You know,
all I ever wanted was to have powers.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.169
To do some good. But now?

28:27.400 --> 28:30.927
Now, I'm the one responsible
for saving Iris' life.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.811
I don't know if I'm gonna be fast enough
to save her, so--

28:35.960 --> 28:37.962
Hey, Wally, you're not alone.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.361
Okay.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.846
FRANCINEI She's right, Wally.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.641
You're not alone.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.121

- I've <i>missed you, too.</i>

Wally?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.889
(WALLY SOBBING)

29:12.000 --> 29:16.403
I'm so proud of you,
of what you're trying to become.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.530
That's all I want.
I just want you to be proud of me.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.050
Wally, you're really freaking me out.

29:22.960 --> 29:27.887
I am, son. I'm so very, very proud,
but you have to stop.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.084
What? Why?

29:31.320 --> 29:33.049
You're working so hard.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.687
You don't see how dangerous it is.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.490
Son, you're not fast enough.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.686
You never will be.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.921
But I can't stop.
I have to save Iris. I have to.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.406
Wally.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.324
You're in my head again.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.446
You were always so smart.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.210
Weren't you, Wallace?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.684
But not smart enough.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.770
I have what I need
to escape my hell, Wallace.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.242
No, not everything,
we still have a piece of that Stone.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.410
Not for long. And once I have it,

30:16.560 --> 30:20.246
you and everyone you love will perish.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.765
- Wally!
-I have to go. I can't let him get out.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.286
- What are you talking about?
-it's Savitar.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.050
You need to tell Barry, okay?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.447
No, I can do this by myself.
Jesse, please, just wait here.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.050
_H€Y-
_H€Y-

30:49.880 --> 30:51.086
I got your message.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.285
Come, sit down.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.646
Iris. Uh...

31:01.120 --> 31:02.451
I know you're mad, but--

31:02.600 --> 31:03.726
No, Barry, that's not it.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.928
I just want you to listen, okay?

31:08.960 --> 31:13.010
I need you to let me say
what I need to say.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.327
Okay.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.487
I'm not angry at you.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.122
I understand that you...

31:22.280 --> 31:26.126
You wanna keep me safe, and us
getting engaged could change the future.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.845
I get all of that.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.450
Barry, when you proposed to me,

31:35.800 --> 31:37.643
I said yes because

31:40.320 --> 31:44.530
I love you more than anything,
and I wanna be your wife.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.887
But I thought that you were asking me
purely out of love, not fear.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.490
And, Barry, whether you realize it or not,

31:53.680 --> 31:56.286
now there's always gonna be a part of us
that's tainted.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.809
Iris, I'm trying to save your life.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.684
I know, and that's the problem.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.561
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

32:06.800 --> 32:11.522
I don't wanna be someone that you're
trying to save for the rest of eternity.

even working?

- What are you doing?
-What are you seeing?

32:36.360 --> 32:37.885
I'm seeing these white flashes.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.570
-It's like--
-Flashes?

32:39.760 --> 32:42.047
Yeah, it's like Savitar's
speeding through, like, a storm.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.329
No, it's not a storm.
It's the Speed Force.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.201
(SIGHS)

32:47.680 --> 32:51.446
He's in the Speed Force. That's why
only speedsters were able to see him.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.405
Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?

32:54.600 --> 32:56.250
He's not hiding.

32:56.400 --> 32:59.131
- That's where the future you trapped him.
-That's right.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.767
And that's why Savitar only appears
for a few moments at a time

33:02.040 --> 33:04.771
because the Speed Force just sucks him
back in. That makes sense.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.964
But we threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.248
And we gave him the very thing
he needed to escape.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.409
Except he said he still needed one thing.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.366
I don't think he can come out
because he doesn't have the whole Stone.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.211
Guys, Wally went after Savitar.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.401
- What?
-What?

33:23.600 --> 33:24.601
He started hallucinating.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.569
He thought he was talking to his mom.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.411
- No, that's not her. That's Savitar.
-Where'd he go?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.329
I don't know. Okay, he was freaking out.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.803
He said he needed to stop Savitar
from getting out. Then he sped off.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.161
The Stone.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.441
W8 gone?

33:43.640 --> 33:45.483
- It's gone.
-Barr, we have to find Wally.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.609
Yeah.
If Savitar gets a hold of the Stone--

33:47.800 --> 33:50.326
- He'll escape for sure.
-I can't find him.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.971
He turned off the suit's telemetry.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.770
Oh, come on!

34:00.480 --> 34:03.962
Poor Wallace. Can't even open a portal.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.603
You can't get rid of that Stone, Wallace.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.123
Like you can't get rid of me.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.329
Shut up, shut up.

34:13.639 --> 34:14.971
You know it's true.

34:15.120 --> 34:19.330
You're not fast enough to throw it
into the Speed Force by yourself!

34:19.520 --> 34:20.601
Shut, up!

34:20.920 --> 34:22.649
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)

34:22.840 --> 34:25.127
I'm gonna get out of here, Wallace,

34:25.320 --> 34:29.768
and then I'm gonna come for you
and Barry and your sister,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.525
and I'll kill everyone you love.

No, you're not real!
You're just in my head, just--

34:36.000 --> 34:41.166
Oh, I am real,
and I know the limits of your speed.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.483
After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.

And that,

with the means for my return.

Wally.

37:43.160 --> 37:47.688
If you had the strength to end my life,
you would have done it in the future,

37:47.880 --> 37:51.646
but Barry Allen doesn't kill.
He's the good guy,

37:51.840 --> 37:55.526
the boy Joe raised, the man Iris loves.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.651
You have everything
and deserve none of it.

38:03.480 --> 38:07.041
I'm going to destroy this city
like I did in the future

38:07.240 --> 38:09.208
so you can see the truth, Barry,

38:09.400 --> 38:13.405
and then you'll treat me like a god.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.080
You're not a god!

38:22.000 --> 38:25.925
- Who are you?
-I am the future, Flash.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.445
Show your face!

38:40.720 --> 38:44.611
I want so badly to kill you, and I will,

38:44.880 --> 38:47.247
but you have to live
a little while longer,

38:47.400 --> 38:50.131
long enough to see Iris die.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.561
(GRUNTS)

38:52.080 --> 38:53.081
(SNARLS)

38:54.200 --> 38:55.201

38:56.960 --> 38:57.961
(GROANING)

38:58.920 --> 39:00.649
-(MACHINES BEEPING)
-The blade didn't hit your organs,

39:00.880 --> 39:02.086
but it did shatter your clavicle.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.281
Hang in there, man. Hang in there.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.562
- CAITLIN: We have to take it out.
-Do it.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.444
Any medicine I give you,
your metabolism would burn through.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.768
- All right. Just do it, okay? Just do it.
-Hold him down.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.922
Okay, okay. You're gonna be okay, mate.
You're gonna be okay.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.286
Bite down on this.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.127
I'm so sorry.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.084
Three, two, one.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.960
(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

39:25.440 --> 39:26.441
(EXHALES)

39:31.280 --> 39:32.281
(SIGHS)

39:33.120 --> 39:35.122
- How long was I out?
-Not long.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.241
Are you in much pain?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.210
I might be able to do something with this.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.487
Joe, I'm sorry.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.646
I'm sorry.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.170
Not your fault.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.006
Where is he?

40:06.640 --> 40:08.165
I mean, is he in pain? Is he...

40:08.360 --> 40:09.361
(SOBBING)

40:14.840 --> 40:17.047
"One will suffer a fate worse than death."

40:17.320 --> 40:19.322
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

40:27.360 --> 40:28.486
Jesse.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.521
L...

40:31.480 --> 40:34.927
I'm not like your dad. I don't really know
what the right words are--

40:40.320 --> 40:41.446
What are we gonna do?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.204
We have to bring him back.
We have to save him.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.369
I can't lose Wally, Barry.

40:54.840 --> 40:55.887
I'm sorry.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.209
I'm gonna work on this.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.561
Yeah.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.561
I'll see you soon.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.243
I'm sorry. I should've never...

41:30.400 --> 41:32.164
- I was afraid.
- BARRY: <i>I</i> know.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.640
Believe me, I know.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.081
Fear makes us do a lot of things
that we shouldn't.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.003
My fear's the reason for all of this.
