WEBVTT

00:05.704 --> 00:07.404
Gunshot?

00:07.406 --> 00:08.739
That's no
gunshot wound.

00:08.741 --> 00:09.940
Looks like he
was stabbed.

00:09.942 --> 00:10.974
You get an I.D.?

00:10.976 --> 00:12.743
No, no wallet.

00:12.745 --> 00:14.144
Robbery?

00:14.847 --> 00:15.812
It's a good bet.

00:15.814 --> 00:18.015
His watch is missing.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.783
This isn't exactly
a high traffic area.

00:20.785 --> 00:22.718
Don't think we're gonna
get many eyewitnesses

00:22.720 --> 00:24.020
coming out of
the woodwork.

00:24.022 --> 00:26.889
No, and anything that was
left behind's washed away--

00:26.891 --> 00:29.526
fibers, hairs,
footprints.

00:29.528 --> 00:32.494
If a tree falls in the forest
and no one's around to hear it,

00:32.497 --> 00:34.230
does it make a sound?

00:36.468 --> 00:39.368
It doesn't matter if there's
a camera in the forest.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.276
I gave you ten dollars!

00:47.278 --> 00:48.744
You give me five,
I give you two.

00:48.746 --> 00:49.779
Hot dog is three.

00:49.781 --> 00:50.980
I gave you ten!

00:50.982 --> 00:52.715
You gave me five,
now get lost

00:52.717 --> 00:54.716
before I call the police!

00:56.019 --> 00:57.819
That's enough. Calm down.

00:57.821 --> 00:59.788
That's enough. That's enough.
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.056
- Hey, hey.
- That's enough. Calm down.

01:01.058 --> 01:02.924
O-Okay. Okay, okay!

01:02.926 --> 01:04.593
Look, look, look,
I got, I got...

01:04.595 --> 01:06.962
I got something in my pocket
that will get me out of this.

01:06.964 --> 01:07.929
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:07.931 --> 01:09.764
Just check my wallet.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.234
As usual, you missed the point.

01:13.236 --> 01:14.636
You asked my opinion,
I gave it.

01:14.638 --> 01:16.204
And it was wrong.
It's my opinion.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.572
It can be neither
right nor wrong.

01:17.574 --> 01:19.307
It can be wrong and it was.

01:19.309 --> 01:20.675
And you were right, right?

01:20.677 --> 01:22.611
Right.
Where's Baker?

01:22.613 --> 01:23.812
In labor.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.814
Careful, Sid, he hasn't
had his coffee yet.

01:25.816 --> 01:27.482
What is it?

01:27.484 --> 01:28.949
Uh, an individual was
arrested this morning

01:28.951 --> 01:30.784
after he assaulted a hot
dog vendor on the street.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.254
Okay.

01:33.256 --> 01:35.556
In the 12th, Officer
Reagan's precinct.

01:35.558 --> 01:37.091
This going somewhere?

01:37.093 --> 01:39.193
Officer Reagan asked me to
bring it to your attention

01:39.195 --> 01:42.062
that the perp had on him
an NYPD courtesy card.

01:42.064 --> 01:43.530
An old one of mine.

01:43.532 --> 01:46.166
No, an old one
of your son's, Joe.

Anthony ABETEMARCO!

02:01.750 --> 02:03.583
Hey! Jimmy boy!

02:03.585 --> 02:05.018
How the hell
are you, pal?

02:05.020 --> 02:06.353
How you doing, huh?

02:06.355 --> 02:08.255
Eh, can't complain.

02:08.257 --> 02:09.622
What's new?
What's new?

02:09.625 --> 02:10.889
Yeah.
I'm still fat.

02:10.892 --> 02:12.259
That's the only news I got to report.

02:12.261 --> 02:14.594
Nah, you look good, man.
You look good.

02:14.596 --> 02:16.195
What about you?
Staying out of trouble?

02:16.197 --> 02:17.697
Yeah, nah, you know,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:17.699 --> 02:19.132
You still
chasing the action.

02:19.134 --> 02:21.801
Yeah, ooh, well,
you know, big shock, huh?

02:21.803 --> 02:24.303
You up or down?

02:24.305 --> 02:26.673
Ah, I'm down and out, Ant.

02:27.742 --> 02:29.208
How deep are you
in the hole?

02:31.445 --> 02:33.445
Ah, Jimmy, to who?

02:33.447 --> 02:37.616
To this group out
in, uh, Bay Ridge. Russians.

02:37.618 --> 02:39.451
We're not bumping into
each other on accident

02:39.453 --> 02:40.852
out here, are we?

02:40.854 --> 02:42.388
You know, I, uh, heard
you worked around here.

02:42.390 --> 02:44.122
I thought I could
hit you up for a favor.

02:44.124 --> 02:45.591
You want me to sit down
with these guys?

02:45.593 --> 02:47.759
Just flash the badge around,
let 'em know I'm a good guy,

02:47.761 --> 02:48.927
and I'm good for it.

02:48.929 --> 02:50.862
How you gonna be
good for it, Jimmy?

02:50.864 --> 02:52.463
I got it all worked out,
it's all good.

02:52.465 --> 02:54.232
I just... I need more time,
you know?

02:55.069 --> 02:57.069
Let me think about it, okay?

02:57.071 --> 02:58.303
No promises.

02:58.305 --> 03:00.572
Yeah, do what you
got to do, I mean...

03:00.574 --> 03:02.107
It's good to see you.

03:02.109 --> 03:03.341
You, too, buddy.

03:25.131 --> 03:26.130
Hey!

03:26.132 --> 03:29.433
Hey, I got something.

03:29.435 --> 03:30.567
What do you got?

03:30.569 --> 03:32.569
Miracle of all miracles,
the surveillance camera

03:32.571 --> 03:35.572
at the crime scene was
actually in working condition.

03:35.574 --> 03:36.841
Well, let's take a look.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.745
This poor guy has
no idea what's coming.

03:41.747 --> 03:42.779
Here we go.

03:42.781 --> 03:44.715
Your money
or your life.

04:07.472 --> 04:08.772
Now, what the hell
was that?

04:08.774 --> 04:10.907
It's not a straight-out
robbery, that's for sure.

04:10.909 --> 04:13.776
No, it looks more like a hit
made to look like a robbery.

05:02.158 --> 05:03.889
without distorting
the image.

05:03.890 --> 05:05.823
Can you move in on his wrist?

05:05.825 --> 05:08.126
Maybe he's got on a watch
that can tell us something,

05:08.128 --> 05:09.527
or a tattoo?

05:13.367 --> 05:14.866
Nothing.

05:14.868 --> 05:17.302
What about his shoes?
Anything specific about them?

05:21.808 --> 05:23.707
Uh, plain black boot.

05:23.709 --> 05:27.145
There's not a single thing you
can tell me about this person

05:27.147 --> 05:28.246
that's unique?

05:28.248 --> 05:29.781
I got something I could
tell you about him.

05:29.783 --> 05:31.749
Whoever he is, he knew
what he was doing.

05:31.751 --> 05:33.651
We got nothing.
Seems so.

05:33.653 --> 05:34.886
What is this?

05:34.888 --> 05:36.953
<i>Who</i> is this?
It's our Vic.

05:36.955 --> 05:38.989
His prints popped
in the system?

05:38.991 --> 05:39.956
Yeah, he got
collared

05:39.958 --> 05:41.792
for a DWI
three years ago.

05:41.794 --> 05:43.727
Lee Bukowski.

05:43.729 --> 05:45.329
Let's go see what we
can learn about him.

05:48.768 --> 05:50.401
Name's Jesse Collins.

05:50.403 --> 05:52.068
Used to be a cop
out in Suffolk.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.136
Oh.

05:53.138 --> 05:55.272
He shot and killed
a man when he came up

05:55.274 --> 05:56.406
on a robbery
in progress.

05:56.408 --> 05:58.842
It was ruled
a good shooting, but...

05:58.844 --> 06:01.411
he never quite
recovered from it.

06:01.413 --> 06:03.613
He briefly worked on the
same task force with Joe.

06:03.615 --> 06:05.348
They exchanged cards,
cop to cop.

06:05.350 --> 06:07.284
And the outcome of the arrest?

06:07.286 --> 06:08.918
It was his first
collar anywhere,

06:08.920 --> 06:10.653
so we gave him a desk
appearance ticket.

06:10.655 --> 06:11.621
Sounds about right.

06:11.623 --> 06:14.256
Yeah.

06:14.258 --> 06:17.960
Actually, I was hoping there was
something we could do for him.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.729
He got off on a DAT.

06:19.731 --> 06:20.697
Yeah, but...

06:20.699 --> 06:22.765
I sat down with him.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.266
He's a... he's a good guy.

06:24.268 --> 06:25.534
He could use a hand.

06:25.536 --> 06:26.969
Well, it sounds like
you already gave him one.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.338
I was hoping maybe you could
call the archbishop,

06:29.340 --> 06:31.340
connect him with
Catholic Charities.

06:31.342 --> 06:32.641
Maybe get him
some counseling...

06:32.643 --> 06:35.244
A request like that usually
goes through channels,

06:35.246 --> 06:37.980
from the precinct delegate,
to the union president

06:37.982 --> 06:39.882
and then to this office.
Right.

06:39.884 --> 06:43.785
I just thought, since he knew
Joe and he used to be a cop...

06:43.787 --> 06:45.654
Your brother knew a lot
of people, and he gave out

06:45.656 --> 06:47.689
a lot of these, as most cops do.

06:47.691 --> 06:49.858
And you know they're
only good for a year anyway.

06:49.860 --> 06:52.293
Yeah, but a courtesy card
given out by any cop

06:52.295 --> 06:53.962
killed in the line of duty
usually jumps

06:53.964 --> 06:55.564
to the top of the pile.
Come on.

06:55.566 --> 06:58.299
I have always tried not
to give special treatment

06:58.301 --> 06:59.667
to my sons,
that would include Joe.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.902
Yeah, I know
that, Dad,

07:00.904 --> 07:03.338
but, after I talked
to his C.O. out in Suffolk,

07:03.340 --> 07:05.406
that's when I found out that
he'd been having trouble

07:05.408 --> 07:07.041
since leaving the job.
Great.

07:07.043 --> 07:10.511
And you brought that forward,
now you can get back to work.

07:14.884 --> 07:15.949
Right.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.866
Excuse me.

07:32.868 --> 07:34.935
Ms. Bukowski?

07:34.937 --> 07:37.204
Detective Reagan. This is
my partner Detective Baez.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.538
Yeah?

07:38.540 --> 07:41.474
Uh, like to ask you a few
questions about your husband.

07:41.476 --> 07:42.609
Ex.

07:42.611 --> 07:44.511
And you don't have to bother,
I already heard.

07:44.513 --> 07:45.779
May he rest in peace.

07:45.781 --> 07:47.414
So, not a fan?

07:47.416 --> 07:49.916
If I was, he wouldn't
be my ex, now would he?

07:49.918 --> 07:51.851
Not an
amicable split?

07:51.853 --> 07:53.219
I'll put it to you this way,

07:53.221 --> 07:55.221
I still celebrate
our anniversary...

07:55.223 --> 07:56.456
of our divorce.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.892
Can you tell us where you
were Monday, Ms. Bukowski?

07:58.894 --> 08:00.827
That's a good one.

08:00.829 --> 08:02.128
You think I killed him?

08:02.130 --> 08:04.096
Did you?
I wish.

08:04.098 --> 08:06.565
If I had the balls to do that,
I would've done it

08:06.567 --> 08:08.968
the first time he smacked me
around 20 years ago.

08:08.970 --> 08:09.955
Sorry.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.171
We both are, but
could you tell us...

08:11.172 --> 08:13.705
I work nights.

08:13.707 --> 08:15.474
I was at Downtown Hospital
working a double.

08:15.476 --> 08:18.177
Have at it.

08:23.784 --> 08:26.051
Yeah, my mother told me.

08:26.053 --> 08:27.953
Really? You as
broken up about it

08:27.955 --> 08:29.220
as she is?

08:29.222 --> 08:31.156
Hey, cut her some slack,
all right?

08:31.158 --> 08:32.758
He was a real prick to everyone,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.960
but he really perfected
his game when it came to her.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.260
What about you?

08:36.263 --> 08:37.562
Me?

08:37.563 --> 08:39.264
I was his son, so he had
a special warm spot

08:39.265 --> 08:40.465
in his heart for me.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.000
I'll never forget the time

08:42.001 --> 08:43.734
he gave me my first beer.

08:43.736 --> 08:45.937
I was nine.

08:45.939 --> 08:46.938
Nine?

08:46.940 --> 08:48.873
Yeah. That was his
parting gift to me.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.776
Never laid eyes on him again.

08:51.778 --> 08:52.810
Okay.

08:52.812 --> 08:54.244
Where were you on Monday night?

08:54.246 --> 08:55.980
I was working here.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.748
You can ask my manager.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.884
We will.

08:59.886 --> 09:01.552
How do you work
for 20 years in a place

09:01.554 --> 09:03.621
and not make a single friend?

09:03.623 --> 09:05.356
Anyone have an Axe to
grind with the guy?

09:05.358 --> 09:06.691
About what?

09:06.693 --> 09:09.059
Taking someone's lunch
out of the break room fridge?

09:09.061 --> 09:11.295
Look, he kept to himself.

09:11.297 --> 09:14.198
Nobody here would bother
to waste a word on the guy,

09:14.200 --> 09:15.565
let alone a bullet.

09:15.567 --> 09:16.967
It was a knife.

09:16.969 --> 09:19.536
Whatever.

09:27.813 --> 09:29.813
You asked to see me,
Your Majesty?

09:29.815 --> 09:31.848
I most certainly did.

09:31.850 --> 09:34.518
Please take a seat,
Detective ABETEMARCO.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.185
“Detective Abetemarco”?

09:36.187 --> 09:38.955
Wow, I must've really screwed
the pooch this time.

09:39.958 --> 09:40.891
What?

09:40.893 --> 09:42.659
What'd I do?

09:45.263 --> 09:46.762
Do you know this guy?

09:46.764 --> 09:47.830
Yeah, that's Jimmy.

09:47.832 --> 09:49.132
Jimmy Pearson
from the old neighborhood.

09:49.134 --> 09:50.500
You two friends?

09:50.502 --> 09:52.468
Whoa.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.070
Where'd you get
these pictures?

09:54.072 --> 09:56.105
Are you friends, Anthony?

09:56.107 --> 09:57.073
Friends?

09:57.075 --> 09:58.074
Sure, I guess.

09:58.076 --> 09:59.608
I mean, I know
him my whole life.

09:59.610 --> 10:01.610
It's not like we
pal around together.

10:01.612 --> 10:03.012
You look pretty chummy to me.

10:03.981 --> 10:05.748
Like I said, he's from
the old neighborhood.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.449
Well,
he's also the subject

10:07.451 --> 10:09.184
of an NYPD investigation.

10:09.186 --> 10:10.452
For what?

10:10.454 --> 10:11.720
Do you know
where your he works?

10:11.722 --> 10:13.756
Yeah, the
phone company.

10:13.758 --> 10:15.925
He's a lifer, his
old man worked there.

10:15.927 --> 10:17.759
Do you know what he does
for the phone company?

10:17.761 --> 10:19.461
Answers the phone?

10:19.463 --> 10:21.029
This isn't funny, Anthony.

10:21.031 --> 10:22.730
He works
in compliance,

10:22.732 --> 10:24.799
which means he has access
to all the customers

10:24.801 --> 10:26.201
personal
information--

10:26.203 --> 10:27.702
their addresses,
phone numbers,

10:27.704 --> 10:30.105
people they call, people who've
called them, et cetera.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.273
Oh, no.

10:31.275 --> 10:33.140
What the hell did Jimmy do?

10:33.142 --> 10:35.009
He's been feeding information

10:35.011 --> 10:37.511
to a group of Russian bookies
for months now.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.614
'Cause he's in the hole to them.

10:39.616 --> 10:41.382
Well,
they're blackmailing him now.

10:42.218 --> 10:46.220
Okay, look, here's the deal.

10:46.222 --> 10:47.956
He sought me out to try
to get me to help him

10:47.958 --> 10:49.123
with the Russians.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.857
But he didn't say nothing
to me about...

10:50.859 --> 10:52.960
what he's been doing
with the phone company.

10:52.962 --> 10:53.994
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

10:53.996 --> 10:55.028
A-And from now on,

10:55.030 --> 10:56.163
I'll have nothing
to do with him.

10:56.165 --> 10:59.166
Well, I was thinking
the opposite, actually.

10:59.168 --> 11:00.734
What are you talking about?

11:00.736 --> 11:02.936
He trusts you.

11:02.938 --> 11:05.573
Looks like he'd tell you
just about anything.

11:05.575 --> 11:07.340
You want me to wear a wire?

11:07.342 --> 11:10.477
I want you
to bring a bad guy to justice.

11:11.346 --> 11:12.746
He's a friend, Erin.

11:12.748 --> 11:14.815
And I ain't no rat.

11:25.793 --> 11:27.193
You know, between the two of us,

11:27.195 --> 11:30.296
we're holding about a dozen
open cases on top of this one.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.364
Huh?

11:31.366 --> 11:33.733
We're behind about
a dozen cases.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.934
What's your point?

11:34.936 --> 11:37.370
This dog has fleas.

11:37.372 --> 11:39.839
No leads, no
eyewitnesses,

11:39.841 --> 11:41.841
no usable
surveillance.

11:41.843 --> 11:43.375
And frankly, a guy
so miserable,

11:43.377 --> 11:45.745
I wouldn't be surprised if his
own mother wanted him dead.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.379
I hear you.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.081
But?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.884
I don't know, I mean,
this could be something,

11:51.886 --> 11:53.218
it could be nothing.

11:53.220 --> 11:55.054
What do you got?
What are you watching?

11:55.056 --> 11:56.388
Well, we have nothing,

11:56.390 --> 11:58.223
but I did a little
digging around

11:58.225 --> 12:00.292
and I might have found
something.

12:00.294 --> 12:03.028
Take a look.

12:03.030 --> 12:05.397
What we witnessed today
in that courtroom was a victory,

12:05.399 --> 12:07.098
not just for my client,
but for justice.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.433
Seems there's
a little bit more

12:08.435 --> 12:10.035
to our Vic's DWI
than we knew.

12:10.037 --> 12:12.170
He killed a mother
and her son?

12:12.172 --> 12:13.404
Head-on collision.

12:13.406 --> 12:14.472
And he got off.

12:14.474 --> 12:16.708
Yeah, well,
it was a first offense

12:16.710 --> 12:18.143
and he lawyered up
with Glen Knapp,

12:18.145 --> 12:19.477
who kicked ass
on the case

12:19.479 --> 12:21.179
so the DA
couldn't make a case,

12:21.181 --> 12:23.181
and Bukowski walked.

12:23.183 --> 12:25.150
Okay, I'll
ask you again,

12:25.152 --> 12:27.218
what are you
looking at?

12:27.220 --> 12:28.686
I think
I might be looking at

12:28.688 --> 12:30.288
a man who is out
for revenge.

12:30.290 --> 12:33.191
I didn't just lose my wife
and my son on that day.

12:33.193 --> 12:34.492
I lost my life.

12:34.494 --> 12:37.161
What happened today

12:37.163 --> 12:38.462
should never happen.

12:38.464 --> 12:40.064
Nothing can bring
my family back

12:40.066 --> 12:42.700
and now, there's no justice.

12:43.603 --> 12:46.403
That man should die.

12:46.405 --> 12:49.073
That man should die!

12:49.075 --> 12:51.308
There's no justice
until Lee Bukowski...

12:51.310 --> 12:53.010
is dead and buried.

12:56.115 --> 12:59.349
Does that sound like a threat
to you?

13:12.202 --> 13:13.667
Detectives?

13:13.669 --> 13:15.803
Mr. Holt?
Yeah, Detective Reagan,

13:15.805 --> 13:17.538
this is my partner,
Detective Baez.

13:17.540 --> 13:18.872
Pleased to meet you.

13:18.874 --> 13:20.174
Let's, uh...

13:20.176 --> 13:21.775
Is this gonna
take a long time?

13:21.777 --> 13:23.511
I have a long list
of patients today.

13:23.513 --> 13:24.745
You're a doctor?

13:24.747 --> 13:26.947
Yeah, a physician's
assistant.

13:26.949 --> 13:28.949
Is this about one
of my patients?

13:28.951 --> 13:30.818
Afraid not.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.786
Do you know this man?

13:37.059 --> 13:39.326
Seems like you do.

13:39.328 --> 13:41.862
Why are you here?

13:41.864 --> 13:45.132
Lee Bukowski was found dead
a few nights ago.

13:45.134 --> 13:48.301
Well, maybe there
is a God, after all.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.438
He was murdered.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.207
Who works in
mysterious ways.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.676
Let me save you a lot
of time and trouble.

13:56.678 --> 13:58.178
Lee Bukowski

13:58.180 --> 14:01.413
was...

14:01.415 --> 14:03.315
less than human.

14:03.317 --> 14:05.618
He was a savage

14:05.620 --> 14:07.620
who took the lives
of the most important people

14:07.622 --> 14:09.355
in my life,
with reckless abandon

14:09.357 --> 14:13.292
and never showed an
ounce of remorse.

14:14.162 --> 14:16.928
I'm not sorry he's dead.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.632
But I'm not happy, either.

14:19.634 --> 14:22.000
More importantly,

14:22.002 --> 14:23.935
I didn't kill him.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.105
Not sure anyone would
blame you if you did.

14:27.107 --> 14:29.408
I didn't.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.544
Mr. Holt,
we have to ask:

14:31.546 --> 14:33.578
where were you
Monday night at 9:00?

14:33.580 --> 14:35.714
In my bed, sleeping.

14:35.716 --> 14:37.315
Alone?

14:38.118 --> 14:41.386
My wife was the
center of my life.

14:41.388 --> 14:44.856
My son was the reason
for my being.

14:44.858 --> 14:47.893
Without them...

14:47.895 --> 14:50.061
I'm always alone.

14:52.965 --> 14:55.132
I really do have to
get back to work.

14:55.968 --> 14:57.402
Okay.

14:58.838 --> 15:00.871
Thanks for your time.

15:05.845 --> 15:07.377
Knock, knock.

15:07.379 --> 15:08.913
Nobody's home.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.750
I got these for you.

15:15.521 --> 15:17.554
Beware of Reagans
bearing gifts.

15:18.357 --> 15:19.990
We need to talk.

15:20.827 --> 15:22.626
Nothing to talk about.

15:22.628 --> 15:24.060
I ain't doing it.

15:24.062 --> 15:26.230
I understand how you feel
and I respect that.

15:26.232 --> 15:28.699
If you did, you
wouldn't be here.

15:28.701 --> 15:30.967
I can make you do it,
you know.

15:30.969 --> 15:33.370
Not that I would,
I'm just making a point.

15:35.274 --> 15:36.740
I need you to look at this.

15:46.118 --> 15:47.650
Who are they?

15:47.652 --> 15:49.418
People who have been hurt

15:49.420 --> 15:51.654
as a result of the information
your friend gave

15:51.656 --> 15:53.389
to the Russians.

15:53.391 --> 15:55.191
This guy
had his knees smashed

15:55.193 --> 15:58.327
with a sledgehammer
over a $10,000 debt.

15:58.329 --> 16:01.163
Now, I know your friend
isn't the one swinging it,

16:01.165 --> 16:02.798
but he sure as hell is the one

16:02.800 --> 16:05.067
putting it
in their hands.

16:24.721 --> 16:26.054
Is it him?

16:26.056 --> 16:28.056
It's impossible to tell.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.324
Well,
what do you feel?

16:29.326 --> 16:31.393
I feel like
if it was my wife and kid

16:31.395 --> 16:32.860
who was killed by Bukowski,

16:32.862 --> 16:34.763
it would definitely be me
under that umbrella.

16:34.765 --> 16:36.097
So you think
it's Holt?

16:36.099 --> 16:38.633
Well, I think everyone is
innocent until proven guilty.

16:38.635 --> 16:39.967
What do you think?

16:39.969 --> 16:41.803
I think I wish
I hadn't dug deeper

16:41.805 --> 16:43.271
into Mr. Holt's
background.

16:43.273 --> 16:44.606
What'd you find?

16:44.608 --> 16:46.908
Before he worked
as a physician's assistant,

16:46.910 --> 16:48.876
he worked in the
medical examiner's office.

16:48.878 --> 16:51.012
And who better to know
how to kill somebody

16:51.014 --> 16:52.546
and then clean up
the crime scene,

16:52.548 --> 16:53.815
not leaving evidence,

16:53.817 --> 16:55.950
than somebody who works
in the M.E.'s office?

16:55.952 --> 16:58.152
Yeah, I don't think
the rain was an accident.

16:58.154 --> 16:59.586
But Holt said he
was home sleeping

16:59.588 --> 17:01.322
at the time of the
murder, right?

17:01.324 --> 17:03.724
Which you and I both
know is highly unlikely.

17:03.726 --> 17:05.992
So we're gonna have to get
a subpoena to find out

17:05.993 --> 17:08.494
which cell tower his phone was
pinging off of at the time.

17:08.497 --> 17:09.561
Do you really want
the answer to that?

17:09.586 --> 17:10.665
Do I want to know?

17:10.665 --> 17:13.634
I'm not sure, but
it's our job to know.

17:13.636 --> 17:14.867
Who you calling?

17:14.869 --> 17:16.770
My sister.

17:22.377 --> 17:24.109
Do you want to start?

17:24.112 --> 17:25.744
No.

17:29.551 --> 17:31.751
Do you want to give me
a little heads-up?

17:31.753 --> 17:33.653
No.

17:35.557 --> 17:37.223
Here I am.

17:38.460 --> 17:41.694
Good. Please.

17:45.933 --> 17:49.502
Okay, I want complete honesty,

17:49.504 --> 17:52.338
full disclosure,
no holds barred.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.839
Agreed?

17:54.675 --> 17:57.009
Uh, first, about?

17:57.011 --> 17:58.677
My son.

17:58.679 --> 18:00.412
Agreed.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.447
Detective Reagan's
a piece of work...

18:02.449 --> 18:05.484
Officer Reagan. Jamie.

18:05.486 --> 18:07.219
Oh.

18:07.221 --> 18:09.120
Jamie.
That's right.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.289
How you think
he is perceived out there,

18:11.291 --> 18:14.359
what the other cops and bosses
think of him?

18:15.429 --> 18:18.497
You actually want us
to talk about one of your kids?

18:18.499 --> 18:20.031
He's hardly a kid.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.232
Son, then.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.668
That's kind of the third rail
around here.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.803
Well, now it's not.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.506
So, please?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.641
Talk to me.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.344
Jamie's an excellent cop.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.214
Other cops like him 'cause
he's reliable and loyal.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.850
Bosses like him because he
excels at everything he does.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.186
If anything, he is
an underused asset.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.689
So you're the good cop?

18:45.691 --> 18:47.124
Boss?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.092
Makes you the bad cop.

18:49.094 --> 18:52.530
Uh, I second everything
Sid just said.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.431
But?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.165
No buts.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.667
But? However?

18:57.669 --> 19:00.370
Okay, there's a question
that floats around here.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.107
Why is Jamie Reagan
still a beat cop?

19:04.109 --> 19:07.077
And the answer to the question
that floats around here?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.679
The stock answer would be:

19:09.681 --> 19:11.348
uh, he's biding his time.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.416
But?

19:12.418 --> 19:14.951
But...

19:14.953 --> 19:16.820
I think it's something else.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.928
I think you're holding him back.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.830
Me?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.565
Could be.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.133
People know you go overboard

19:31.135 --> 19:33.936
making sure that there's no
special treatment for your kids.

19:33.938 --> 19:37.340
Jamie's successes and failures
should be purely his own,

19:37.342 --> 19:38.841
like every other cop.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.509
But he's not like
every other cop.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.644
And pretending he is
doesn't make it so.

19:42.646 --> 19:45.581
So I should just move him
up the ranks as I please?

19:45.583 --> 19:47.716
No, but however
well-intentioned you are,

19:47.718 --> 19:50.051
in not artificially
helping him along,

19:50.053 --> 19:52.788
it actually does the opposite.

19:52.790 --> 19:56.024
It artificially
holds him back.

19:56.026 --> 19:57.726
How?

19:57.728 --> 20:00.328
There are bosses on this job

20:00.330 --> 20:01.897
who are very interested
in Jamie.

20:01.899 --> 20:03.831
And who wouldn't be?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.933
They want to tap him
for special assignments,

20:05.935 --> 20:07.502
even promotions,

20:07.504 --> 20:10.238
but they're afraid in doing so,
it will ruffle your feathers.

20:14.511 --> 20:16.344
You second this?

20:18.015 --> 20:19.447
Yes, boss.

20:32.529 --> 20:34.762
Should I have a lawyer here?

20:34.764 --> 20:37.197
Only if you think
you need one.

20:37.199 --> 20:40.067
I...
What do you want?

20:40.069 --> 20:42.302
Well, we checked
your phone records, Mr. Holt.

20:42.304 --> 20:44.271
Your cell phone pinged
off of the tower

20:44.273 --> 20:45.939
closest to the murder scene.

20:45.941 --> 20:47.908
Actually, to clarify,

20:47.910 --> 20:50.010
it didn't ping
the night of the murder,

20:50.012 --> 20:52.346
but as you can see
from these records,

20:52.348 --> 20:54.480
your cell phone was
in that area

20:54.482 --> 20:57.050
many times over
the past few weeks.

20:57.052 --> 20:58.518
Which tells us

20:58.520 --> 21:01.220
that you were casing
the scene,

21:01.222 --> 21:03.789
tracking Mr. Bukowski,

21:03.791 --> 21:05.525
getting to know
his routine.

21:05.527 --> 21:08.027
No.

21:08.029 --> 21:09.562
No? Okay, then why else

21:09.564 --> 21:11.397
would you be
in the same place

21:11.399 --> 21:13.732
where the man you hate
most in life was killed?

21:13.734 --> 21:15.333
Here, here,

21:15.335 --> 21:18.403
here, here, here,
here, and here.

21:18.405 --> 21:19.705
Hmm?

21:19.707 --> 21:24.142
There's a restaurant in that
neighborhood that I like.

21:24.144 --> 21:26.211
How convenient.

21:26.213 --> 21:28.146
Well, you can check

21:28.148 --> 21:30.182
my credit card bill
if you'd like to.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.920
Why don't you do that?

21:43.564 --> 21:45.863
Hey.

21:45.865 --> 21:47.899
You want to tell me
what's going on?

21:47.901 --> 21:48.476
With?

21:48.500 --> 21:50.002
Interfering with
the witness

21:50.003 --> 21:51.302
while I'm
interrogating him.

21:51.304 --> 21:52.470
I didn't interfere.

21:52.472 --> 21:54.338
You realize there's a
reason I left out the fact

21:54.340 --> 21:56.040
that we didn't have his
cell phone in the area

21:56.042 --> 21:57.274
at the time of the
murder, right?

21:57.276 --> 21:59.176
Yeah, I know, you were
trying to trip him up.

21:59.178 --> 22:01.079
Yeah, trip him up,
which I couldn't do

22:01.081 --> 22:02.413
because you gave it up.

22:02.415 --> 22:04.115
He's a smart guy,
Danny.

22:04.117 --> 22:05.749
The reason he left
his cell phone at home

22:05.751 --> 22:07.585
is so his movements
couldn't be tracked.

22:07.587 --> 22:08.552
That's not the point.

22:08.554 --> 22:10.354
He was confused,
he was rattled.

22:10.356 --> 22:11.688
Well, I was trying
to build some trust.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.592
That is a rationalization,
and you know it.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.959
Look, if you're asking me
if I want

22:15.961 --> 22:17.060
to nail this guy
to the wall,

22:17.062 --> 22:19.429
the answer is
a big fat no.

22:19.431 --> 22:20.998
Well, neither do I, okay?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.166
But that doesn't mean
we don't do our jobs.

22:23.168 --> 22:25.869
I know, but there's
doing our job,

22:25.871 --> 22:27.137
and there's doing our job.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.231
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

22:28.255 --> 22:29.240
It means...

22:29.241 --> 22:31.266
do we have to
do our job so well?

22:31.290 --> 22:33.111
Go on.

22:33.112 --> 22:35.012
This monster killed
this man's

22:35.014 --> 22:36.979
wife and only child.
Uh-huh.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.448
I know what you would do.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.682
I know what I would do.

22:39.684 --> 22:41.217
So how do we judge him?

22:41.219 --> 22:42.385
Well, that's just
the thing.

22:42.387 --> 22:44.854
We're not the judge,
we're only the cops.

22:44.856 --> 22:46.523
Okay, and for better
or worse,

22:46.525 --> 22:47.657
we do what we gotta do.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.692
Now, let's find those
credit card receipts,

22:49.694 --> 22:52.394
and find out about
this restaurant.

23:02.373 --> 23:04.173
Thanks for seeing me
again, man.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.775
You're a good friend.

23:05.777 --> 23:07.843
I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.978
I know, but just that
you considered it at all

23:09.980 --> 23:12.214
means a lot to me.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.550
You know, if we're
gonna do this,

23:14.552 --> 23:15.872
I got to know
the lay of the land.

23:15.896 --> 23:16.686
Yeah.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.720
You got it.
Anything you need.

23:18.722 --> 23:19.655
You can't hold back on me.

23:19.657 --> 23:21.190
You gotta tell me
everything.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.092
'Cause if I go in there and
I haven't got the real score,

23:24.094 --> 23:25.493
we could both get hurt.

23:25.495 --> 23:26.995
I understand.
You got it, man.

23:26.997 --> 23:28.362
I'll tell you
everything.

23:28.364 --> 23:29.530
Anything you need.

23:29.532 --> 23:31.833
Please say you'll
do this for me, 'cause

23:31.835 --> 23:35.970
I don't know what's gonna
happen to me... if you don't.

23:47.183 --> 23:49.283
What's going on?
I can't hear 'em.

23:51.487 --> 23:54.054
He unplugged.
He... he what?

23:54.056 --> 23:56.691
Anthony, you plug in
right now.

23:56.693 --> 23:59.292
He can't hear you.
He ca...

23:59.294 --> 24:01.461
Are you kidding me?

24:01.463 --> 24:03.797
I'm gonna kill him.

24:06.202 --> 24:08.268
I'm gonna kill him.

24:17.774 --> 24:19.274
Anthony?!

24:21.932 --> 24:23.499
You are in big trouble.

24:23.501 --> 24:25.368
- Hang on a second.
- No, you hang on.

24:25.370 --> 24:27.703
You cannot do that.
You cannot

24:27.705 --> 24:29.605
unilaterally abort
an operation

24:29.607 --> 24:30.572
in the middle of a meet.

24:30.574 --> 24:32.440
I didn't.
You did!

24:32.442 --> 24:33.942
You unplugged
just as the target

24:33.944 --> 24:35.343
was about to
give up everything.

24:35.345 --> 24:36.945
Yeah, but...
No buts!

24:36.947 --> 24:38.881
You put your relationship
with this guy

24:38.883 --> 24:40.181
ahead of your
responsibility

24:40.183 --> 24:42.117
as a representative
of this office.

24:42.119 --> 24:44.152
No, I didn't.
You did!

24:44.154 --> 24:47.155
Can I say something now?
What?

24:47.157 --> 24:48.623
Yes, I should have
discussed it with you first.

24:48.625 --> 24:49.724
Should have!
It's your job.

24:49.726 --> 24:52.127
Can I finish?

24:52.129 --> 24:55.263
I didn't abort.
I just called an audible.

24:55.265 --> 24:57.865
- What?
- In football, the quarterback...

24:57.867 --> 24:59.600
I know what it means, Anthony.

24:59.602 --> 25:01.736
He was about to
tell me everything,

25:01.738 --> 25:04.505
and then something you said
gave me a better idea.

25:04.507 --> 25:06.807
Why are we going after
Jimmy the small fish

25:06.809 --> 25:09.276
when we can use him as bait
to harpoon the Russians?

25:09.278 --> 25:12.613
Because that wasn't
the objective, Anthony.

25:12.615 --> 25:14.381
I know, but why not?

25:14.383 --> 25:16.950
Because it...
it just wasn't.

25:16.952 --> 25:18.919
Jimmy's back is
up against the wall.

25:18.921 --> 25:21.288
He spills everything
on the Russians,

25:21.290 --> 25:23.290
and we make
a much bigger case.

25:23.292 --> 25:26.793
Besides, I know how
to talk to him.

25:33.301 --> 25:37.270
It's not a completely
terrible idea.

25:37.272 --> 25:42.642
Your flattery humbles
me, Your Grace.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.147
<i>The guy doesn't have</i>
<i>any family, never married.</i>

25:48.149 --> 25:49.115
His parents have passed.

25:49.117 --> 25:50.416
So I took him down
to the facility,

25:50.418 --> 25:52.192
checked him in--
all off-duty, of course.

25:52.216 --> 25:53.320
Good for you.

25:53.321 --> 25:55.888
To me, part of my job.

25:55.890 --> 25:59.358
So thanks for coming out.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.926
Been on my mind--

26:00.928 --> 26:04.263
do you ever think of us
as a family business?

26:04.265 --> 26:06.331
Sure, as does
half New York.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.601
Okay, let's switch
the particulars

26:08.603 --> 26:09.935
for sake of discussion.

26:09.937 --> 26:12.204
Say our family business
was barstools.

26:12.206 --> 26:14.873
Barstools?
Or whatever.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.875
No barstools is good.
Okay.

26:16.877 --> 26:19.778
So Pop founded it,
I took over for him.

26:19.780 --> 26:22.380
Erin keeps the books
and handles distribution,

26:22.382 --> 26:24.182
and Danny goes all over
the five boroughs

26:24.184 --> 26:25.484
looking for business.

26:25.486 --> 26:26.985
Sounds about right.

26:26.987 --> 26:29.287
Where are you?

26:32.259 --> 26:33.891
On the shop floor.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.461
Is that where
you want to be?

26:39.232 --> 26:40.632
Not sure I follow.

26:40.634 --> 26:43.200
Well, you've got
the education,

26:43.202 --> 26:44.702
you certainly have
the talent.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.705
You've got the drive to go
above and beyond, and...

26:47.707 --> 26:50.441
I'm still on the shop floor
making barstools.

26:50.443 --> 26:53.477
Yeah. You see
what I'm getting at?

26:53.479 --> 26:56.213
I do.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.381
Let me ask you something?

26:57.383 --> 26:59.416
Sure.
You're in a family business,

26:59.418 --> 27:01.185
Whether it's making
barstools

27:01.187 --> 27:02.819
or keeping these streets safe.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.821
Shouldn't somebody
in the family

27:04.823 --> 27:06.123
be on the shop floor

27:06.125 --> 27:08.091
with their hands
on the product every day?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.766
Your metaphor.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.100
I'm thinking.

27:20.104 --> 27:23.205
I'm late.
Thanks for breakfast, Dad.

27:23.207 --> 27:25.741
And I don't know who else
is a part of this discussion,

27:25.743 --> 27:27.977
but you can tell them for me...

27:27.979 --> 27:29.779
real happy where I'm at.

27:37.854 --> 27:40.722
Boom, boom,
boom, and boom.

27:40.724 --> 27:42.090
And these booms are...

27:42.092 --> 27:44.193
He was at the restaurant,
just like he said he was.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.161
Wow, good work.
I, uh, found her.

27:46.163 --> 27:47.563
He was telling the truth.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.931
Yeah, I'm sure.
Thanks.

27:49.933 --> 27:52.200
What, you still
don't believe him?

27:52.202 --> 27:54.268
No, I believe
he was in the restaurant

27:54.270 --> 27:56.304
every single time
he said he was.

27:56.306 --> 27:58.472
You think it's a cover.
No.

27:58.474 --> 28:01.342
I think he's a smart guy,
like you said he was.

28:01.344 --> 28:04.045
Which means he wanted us to
check his credit card receipts,

28:04.047 --> 28:06.647
'cause that was him
building his alibi.

28:06.649 --> 28:09.049
Wow, you really want
to get this guy.

28:09.051 --> 28:12.286
No, I just...
I'm doing my job.

28:12.288 --> 28:14.388
You know, we can stick
this case in a drawer

28:14.390 --> 28:17.024
right now, and no one
would ever be the wiser.

28:17.026 --> 28:19.260
No, we couldn't.

28:19.262 --> 28:20.595
What is that?

28:20.597 --> 28:23.330
This is the exterior
of Lee Bukowski's apartment.

28:23.332 --> 28:25.933
This is Lee Bukowski
leaving his apartment.

28:25.935 --> 28:28.168
And that is William Holt

28:28.170 --> 28:32.206
following Lee Bukowski
leaving his apartment.

28:38.714 --> 28:40.780
Could be a coincidence.

28:40.782 --> 28:44.284
Not nine times it couldn't.

28:47.088 --> 28:48.655
What do you mean you're
not gonna sit down with them?

28:48.657 --> 28:50.423
I thought that's
what we worked out.

28:50.425 --> 28:52.392
It's not gonna happen.

28:52.394 --> 28:53.860
Why not?

28:53.862 --> 28:55.695
'Cause you're jammed up
pretty good, Jimmy.

28:55.697 --> 28:57.930
And not just with
the Russians, either.

28:57.932 --> 28:59.832
Jammed up how?

28:59.834 --> 29:02.034
NYPD knows you've been
feeding sensitive

29:02.036 --> 29:03.803
proprietary information

29:03.805 --> 29:05.304
to the bookmakers
that you're into.

29:05.306 --> 29:06.438
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.775
He's talking about this.

29:08.777 --> 29:11.110
Who are you?
Who's this?

29:11.112 --> 29:13.445
I'm Erin Reagan,
Assistant District Attorney.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.980
You set me up.
Take it easy.

29:14.982 --> 29:17.215
Nobody set up anybody.

29:17.217 --> 29:18.317
This is an ambush.
You walked me into

29:18.319 --> 29:19.285
a friggin' ambush!

29:19.287 --> 29:20.819
That is not what this is.

29:20.821 --> 29:22.888
My ass it isn't.
Am I getting collared here?

29:22.890 --> 29:25.724
Is that what this is?
How could you?

29:25.726 --> 29:27.459
You want to be upset
at him, be my guest.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.494
But you should know
he's the only reason why

29:29.496 --> 29:31.362
you're not already
behind bars.

29:31.364 --> 29:33.765
NYPD had been
watching you for weeks.

29:33.767 --> 29:37.068
We had you on a wire, ready
to put you away for years,

29:37.070 --> 29:38.770
but your friend here
saw a better way.

29:38.772 --> 29:39.470
What way?

29:39.494 --> 29:41.619
You need to give up
the Russians, Jimmy.

29:41.708 --> 29:42.874
Get the hell out of here.

29:42.876 --> 29:45.143
If you don't, you're gonna
end up in this folder.

29:45.145 --> 29:48.212
If I do, I'm gonna end up
at the bottom of the Gowanus.

29:48.214 --> 29:51.316
Not if your testimony puts every
last one of them behind bars.

29:51.318 --> 29:53.017
Listen to her, Jimmy.

29:53.019 --> 29:55.353
She knows what
she's talking about.

29:56.155 --> 29:58.756
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

29:58.758 --> 30:00.692
Jimmy, wait.
Forget me.

30:00.694 --> 30:03.560
Forget my face.
Forget my name.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.551
No! I'm getting the money!

30:27.553 --> 30:28.585
I'm getting it! No!

30:28.587 --> 30:30.687
Drop it now!
Did I stutter?

30:38.864 --> 30:40.063
You okay, pal?

30:40.065 --> 30:43.299
Huh? Huh?

30:43.301 --> 30:46.069
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.

30:46.071 --> 30:48.204
It's gonna be okay.

30:54.011 --> 30:55.711
Okay, that's our Vic.

30:55.713 --> 30:57.980
This guy coming
around the corner,

30:57.982 --> 31:00.048
with the newspaper,
he's appeared like that

31:00.050 --> 31:03.486
nine times in the
last month. Nine.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.954
Yeah, it's good.
I think you're probably right.

31:05.956 --> 31:07.055
He's your guy.
Yup.

31:07.057 --> 31:08.257
You don't have enough.

31:09.126 --> 31:11.994
Oh. Okay.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.856
“Okay”?

31:13.857 --> 31:14.393
Yeah, what?

31:14.417 --> 31:15.999
You're not gonna
fight with me?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.532
You always fight with me.
I do?

31:17.534 --> 31:19.234
You huff and puff
all over the place,

31:19.236 --> 31:20.903
and I wave my finger around,

31:20.905 --> 31:21.904
and preach about
the proper procedure

31:21.906 --> 31:23.138
in a criminal
justice system.

31:23.140 --> 31:26.107
That's what we do.
That's... that's our thing.

31:26.109 --> 31:27.542
Well, I'm maturing.

31:27.544 --> 31:28.710
Yeah, right.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.678
What's going on?

31:33.283 --> 31:36.418
Okay, I'm kind of hoping
that I...

31:36.420 --> 31:37.385
don't make the case.

31:37.387 --> 31:38.953
I'm trying hard
and doing my job,

31:38.955 --> 31:42.423
but... I'm kind of hoping
this one craps out.

31:42.425 --> 31:45.293
Well, let me be the one
to let you off the hook a bit.

31:45.295 --> 31:48.429
You can't place him at the
scene, you don't have enough.

31:48.431 --> 31:49.630
Right.

31:49.632 --> 31:51.966
I guess I don't have enough.

31:51.968 --> 31:53.767
You check his car?

31:53.769 --> 31:54.768
See if he got
a summons that day?

31:54.770 --> 31:55.769
I mean, stranger things
have happened.

31:55.771 --> 31:57.871
Remember Son of Sam?

31:57.873 --> 32:00.474
Actually, he doesn't drive.

32:00.476 --> 32:02.609
Then you're off the hook.

32:02.611 --> 32:04.745
Yes, I am.

32:12.721 --> 32:14.554
What?

32:14.556 --> 32:16.957
He doesn't drive.

32:17.759 --> 32:19.725
Yeah, you said that.

32:20.562 --> 32:23.430
But he does take the subway.

32:24.967 --> 32:27.968
Have you pulled the surveillance
from the nearby subway station?

32:29.637 --> 32:33.439
No, I did not... but I will.

32:47.312 --> 32:50.178
So, we got a deal? Jimmy's
gonna wear a wire for us?

32:50.180 --> 32:52.515
I don't think so.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.682
Are you kidding me?
You saved his life.

32:54.684 --> 32:56.017
I was surprised myself.

32:56.019 --> 32:58.085
Surprised? How about pissed?

32:58.087 --> 33:01.022
Okay, that, too.
Look, he's an annoying guy.

33:01.024 --> 33:02.289
He's been like that
since we were kids.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.759
Well, he's not gonna
get away with this.

33:04.761 --> 33:07.161
I still have enough on him
to make his life miserable.

33:07.163 --> 33:08.763
I don't think you're
gonna want to do that.

33:08.765 --> 33:10.631
Why not?

33:10.633 --> 33:12.066
'Cause it might undermine
the credibility

33:12.068 --> 33:14.701
of your star witness.

33:14.703 --> 33:18.072
What are you talking about?

33:18.074 --> 33:19.340
He's not gonna wear a wire

33:19.342 --> 33:20.574
because there's no need to.

33:20.576 --> 33:21.975
He's already got them
all on tape.

33:21.977 --> 33:25.913
The worm that he is,
he recorded every phone call

33:25.915 --> 33:27.213
where he exchanged information

33:27.215 --> 33:28.448
with the Russians.

33:28.450 --> 33:29.983
There's hundreds on there,

33:29.985 --> 33:32.619
and each one
of them match up

33:32.621 --> 33:34.788
with one of these.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.626
I love you, Anthony.

33:39.628 --> 33:42.262
See, now I can die a happy man.

33:42.264 --> 33:43.696
I'm gonna kill you,

33:43.698 --> 33:45.365
but I love you.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.674
Hey, Mr. Holt.

33:54.676 --> 33:56.443
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

33:56.445 --> 33:58.578
Right this way.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.881
Come on in.

34:01.883 --> 34:03.082
Hi, William.

34:05.286 --> 34:06.719
What is he doing here?

34:06.721 --> 34:10.255
You remember me. Glen Knapp.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.623
What is he doing here?

34:11.626 --> 34:13.693
Well, he's your
attorney, Mr. Holt.

34:13.695 --> 34:15.728
Like hell he is.
This is the guy who got

34:15.730 --> 34:16.962
that monster off.

34:16.964 --> 34:18.929
Yes, because I'm good
at what I do.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.599
Listen, I don't know what's

34:20.601 --> 34:22.934
going on in here,
but I'm leaving.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.270
You're not going anywhere.
Get over there.

34:25.272 --> 34:28.574
I'm here as a courtesy.
I'm not under arrest.

34:28.576 --> 34:30.675
Actually, you are.
What?

34:30.677 --> 34:32.777
Please, don't say any more,
Mr. Holt.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.646
Why don't you take a
look at this, Mr. Holt?

34:36.116 --> 34:37.748
This is you, Mr. Holt.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.393
That's not me.

34:49.395 --> 34:51.629
It is, and...

34:52.797 --> 34:54.632
...so is this.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.308
That's not me.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.044
Would you take out your
MetroCard please, Mr. Holt?

35:07.046 --> 35:08.345
Do not do that.

35:08.347 --> 35:11.882
Doesn't actually matter
anyway because we traced

35:11.884 --> 35:13.416
the MetroCard you used
at the turnstile

35:13.418 --> 35:14.952
back to your personal
credit card.

35:14.954 --> 35:17.521
Which is more than enough
to impanel a grand jury.

35:17.523 --> 35:18.656
And to get an indictment.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.290
But not a conviction.

35:22.028 --> 35:24.961
Not so long as
I'm representing you.

35:27.299 --> 35:28.698
Wait a minute.

35:28.700 --> 35:33.136
The two of you... have already
convinced him to take my case?

35:33.138 --> 35:35.539
You're under arrest, Mr. Holt.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.607
Don't worry.

35:37.609 --> 35:40.109
You'll be out on bail
in less than 24 hours.

35:40.111 --> 35:41.243
I don't know what to say.

35:41.245 --> 35:42.211
Please...

35:42.213 --> 35:44.113
don't say anything.

35:44.115 --> 35:46.983
I'd listen to him.
He's pretty smart.

35:49.253 --> 35:51.154
Thank you.

35:52.857 --> 35:55.724
Thank you both.

35:59.630 --> 36:01.564
Come on in.

36:05.703 --> 36:08.237
Sorry to call last minute.

36:08.239 --> 36:09.738
Oh, not a problem.

36:09.740 --> 36:10.906
You okay with it?

36:13.643 --> 36:16.578
You should be the one
to have it.

36:21.085 --> 36:23.752
Thanks for this.

36:23.754 --> 36:26.021
Coffee or something?

36:26.023 --> 36:29.591
The other day,
I didn't mean to suggest

36:29.593 --> 36:31.892
that you weren't living up
to your potential.

36:31.894 --> 36:33.528
Didn't take it that way.

36:33.530 --> 36:36.163
It was the impression I got.

36:38.368 --> 36:40.935
To each his own.
Let's leave it at that, huh?

36:40.937 --> 36:43.504
My point was
you're a hell of a good cop,

36:43.506 --> 36:46.941
and there's lots of places
you can benefit this department.

36:48.477 --> 36:51.912
I don't think I got another cop
with a Harvard law degree.

36:55.251 --> 36:56.617
And I know
I've always been a hard-ass

36:56.619 --> 36:59.053
about keeping my distance
from you and your brothers

36:59.055 --> 37:00.988
where the job's concerned.

37:00.990 --> 37:02.723
Wouldn't have it any other way.

37:02.725 --> 37:06.727
I'd hate to think
I was holding you back.

37:06.729 --> 37:10.230
You haven't... ever.

37:14.637 --> 37:19.472
Thing is, Dad, I'm...
damn proud of my bar stools.

37:21.542 --> 37:24.210
Any given day, I can stop
a robbery, prevent a murder...

37:24.212 --> 37:27.747
take a gun off the
street, save a life...

37:27.749 --> 37:29.382
steer a kid straight,

37:29.384 --> 37:32.752
and, you know, help out
a neighbor I don't know.

37:32.754 --> 37:36.389
Hell, I even get to...
deliver a baby once and a while.

37:36.391 --> 37:40.259
It's funny how all cops
love that one.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.128
I'm excited every single shift.

37:43.130 --> 37:44.730
How many people can say that?

37:44.732 --> 37:47.065
A lucky few.

37:48.169 --> 37:50.403
Can you?

37:52.173 --> 37:55.307
Well... I remember the feeling.

37:55.309 --> 37:56.608
Why'd you give it up?

37:56.610 --> 37:59.577
In my day, you moved up
through the ranks.

37:59.579 --> 38:02.781
That's just what you did.

38:02.783 --> 38:05.383
I never thought to question it.

38:07.121 --> 38:09.987
And if you had it
to do all over again?

38:13.493 --> 38:16.928
I'd be right where you are.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.506
Okay, look,
I don't know about

38:29.508 --> 38:30.641
the rest of you,
but I'm starving

38:30.643 --> 38:32.009
- No, no.
- Yes, yes.

38:32.011 --> 38:33.244
No, no, no.

38:33.246 --> 38:35.346
The rule is we don't start
till everybody's here.

38:35.348 --> 38:37.614
- Has anybody checked their phones?
- We've been waiting forever.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.616
- Sorry.
- Ah, finally.

38:39.618 --> 38:40.684
Ah.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.853
We got caught up.

38:42.855 --> 38:44.621
Doing what, pray tell?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.056
Making bar stools.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.691
- Huh?
- Long story.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.560
Can we just sit down and eat?

38:49.562 --> 38:50.627
The food's getting cold.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.662
Okay, okay.

38:51.664 --> 38:52.796
Whose turn is it?

38:52.798 --> 38:54.164
Danny's.
Mom's.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.265
- Nicky's.
- Sean.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.100
Jack or Sean,
say grace now, okay?

38:57.102 --> 38:59.035
Sean, just say it.
Just, yeah.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.271
Why do I have to do everything
no one else wants to do?

39:01.273 --> 39:02.906
Because you're low man
on the totem pole, that's why.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.074
Now let's go, come on.

39:04.076 --> 39:05.508
I cannot wait
until you get married

39:05.510 --> 39:07.077
- and have a kid.
- Whoa!

39:07.079 --> 39:08.311
Do you know something
I don't know?

39:08.313 --> 39:10.914
That you're insane?
Please, somebody just do it.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.949
Seriously, why is it
that no one at this table

39:12.951 --> 39:14.617
ever wants to say grace?
Linda's turn.

39:14.619 --> 39:15.951
- Linda's turn.
- Happily.

39:15.953 --> 39:17.487
Just say it, Mom.
In the name of the Father...

39:17.489 --> 39:20.189
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'd like to say something.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.157
Oh, my God, you
got to be kidding me.

39:22.159 --> 39:26.696
Used to be another
chair at this table.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.364
Right down there next to Pop.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.668
I met a friend
of Joe's this week.

39:33.670 --> 39:36.805
Truth is they didn't know
each other that well.

39:36.807 --> 39:41.176
And even though Joe's
been gone for years...

39:41.178 --> 39:44.446
it didn't stop him from helping
his friend out of a jam.

39:44.448 --> 39:46.848
So, it got me to thinking,

39:46.850 --> 39:48.917
that's who Joe
was in our family,

39:48.919 --> 39:51.352
the shop steward...

39:55.559 --> 39:58.259
...the guy who looked out
for all the other guys.

40:01.598 --> 40:06.267
Anyway, instead of grace,
how about a toast?

40:09.406 --> 40:11.406
To our shop steward.
