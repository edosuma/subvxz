02:17.562 --> 02:18.463
Hey, friend.

02:19.798 --> 02:23.568
My associates and I would like
to charter an afternoon flight.

02:25.838 --> 02:26.906
What's he doing?

02:31.911 --> 02:32.811
Where are you going?

02:32.845 --> 02:34.013
Shut up.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.548
[man] There's not enough
fuel in the tank.

02:36.581 --> 02:37.850

[man]
<i>Omelet, Swiss, green peppers,</i>

05:57.116 --> 06:01.253

[waitress]
You got it, easy rider.

06:12.764 --> 06:16.001
[man] Ah, you can't be
fucking serious.

06:16.035 --> 06:17.836
[woman]
Jack, keep your voice down.

06:18.537 --> 06:20.272
[Jack] I don't fucking care
who hears me.

06:20.306 --> 06:22.707
I am not canceling last
minute like this.

06:23.242 --> 06:26.378
Besides, I know what kind of guy
this Suzie goes with

06:26.412 --> 06:28.813
and I don't want you
anywhere near those scumbags.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.616
[woman] Jack.

06:30.649 --> 06:34.186
[Jack] I know what you girls get up to and I've
already taken time off. I... I can't undo that.

06:34.987 --> 06:36.422
[woman] Jack, I can't miss this.

06:36.455 --> 06:39.724
[Jack] Oh, yeah. Yeah, you sure
fucking can.

06:40.459 --> 06:44.296
Why do you always got to do this to me?
It's fucking horseshit.

06:51.470 --> 06:54.139
How about not talking
to the lady that way?

06:56.275 --> 06:57.243
Excuse me?

06:57.276 --> 07:00.112
How about not talking
to the lady that way?

07:02.548 --> 07:06.452
I will talk however the fuck
I want to talk, asshole.

07:06.485 --> 07:11.423
I'm sure you always do, but all of us
out here with manners who hear you,

07:11.457 --> 07:14.960
we talked it over and
we all think you're an idiot.

08:21.994 --> 08:23.429
You ready for the
check, easy rider?

08:23.462 --> 08:26.498
In a way, yes. I was running
third on this omelet here

08:26.532 --> 08:30.502
and here, take a peek
under these eggs.

08:30.536 --> 08:33.272
Jesus! It turns my stomach.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.075
Honey, I am so sorry. I gotta go
yell at someone in the back.

08:36.107 --> 08:38.309
The check, of course, is on us.

09:22.688 --> 09:26.658
Again, I am so sorry. How about
a piece of pie for the road?

09:27.593 --> 09:30.062
There's a question you don't
have to ask me twice.

09:38.437 --> 09:42.040
[music playing on the radio]

09:49.615 --> 09:50.482
[Jack] Hey!

09:52.284 --> 09:54.219
You wanna finish
what you started?

09:54.253 --> 09:58.257
Friend, if it means talking to you
any further, I'll have to pass.

10:00.459 --> 10:04.296
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Who the fuck you think you are?

10:04.329 --> 10:07.366
Spiderman, but you caught
me on my day off.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.034
Nice backpack, faggot!

10:09.067 --> 10:13.639
Look, man, how about letting me take my
pie and be on my way. How does that sound?

10:13.672 --> 10:16.708
I don't like how that sounds.
You shouldn't have messed with me, man.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.444
Oh, yeah, why is that?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.584
[man coughing]

10:28.787 --> 10:30.656
[woman screaming] Help!

10:31.390 --> 10:32.291
Really?

10:33.659 --> 10:35.327
[car starting up]

10:35.360 --> 10:36.695
[woman] Are you okay?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.446
[car honking]

10:54.480 --> 10:56.482
[driver] Sidewalk, asshole!

11:21.507 --> 11:25.010
[man running by]

11:38.156 --> 11:40.259

[truck starting up]

12:49.896 --> 12:53.098
[opening and closing truck door]

13:10.782 --> 13:12.018
Hear about the fire?

13:12.051 --> 13:15.253
Yeah, we already got our cows
off that pasture yesterday, so.

13:15.287 --> 13:16.488
- Okay. Good.
- So, we're clean.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.323
We're hoping it's just
smoke and little fire.

13:18.357 --> 13:19.791
[man] With our luck it
will be nothing.

13:19.826 --> 13:21.193
[woman] Diehard, this one.

13:22.361 --> 13:23.462
I'm in it for the adventure.

13:23.495 --> 13:26.398
Of course, Sherriff. I got a new
adventure ahead of me.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.935
Got a shitload of barbed wire
in there.

13:28.968 --> 13:30.369
[man] Four-hour drive.

13:30.402 --> 13:33.505
[woman] Alrighty then, gentlemen.
You got to go see a barbed fence.

13:33.538 --> 13:34.907
[man] See you.

13:37.476 --> 13:38.377
[closing truck door]

13:40.245 --> 13:44.249

[opening truck door]

15:37.997 --> 15:38.931
Good girl.

15:44.503 --> 15:46.705
Yeah. I knew that's what
you needed.

15:50.442 --> 15:52.344
Come now.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.381
Come on now.

17:35.114 --> 17:37.016
Oh, my God.

18:11.516 --> 18:14.819
[whistling]

18:16.821 --> 18:17.857
Might as well.

18:45.117 --> 18:47.752
[trying to start up the truck]

18:52.524 --> 18:53.458
Come on.

19:25.191 --> 19:27.492
Beatrice, we're a team.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.059
Great job.
Step on out there, partner.

21:46.065 --> 21:47.399
All right, come on over here.

21:49.368 --> 21:51.837
Are you... do you have keys?

22:02.714 --> 22:04.216
Worst part's over, fellas.

22:05.184 --> 22:07.353
Not saying it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out,

22:07.386 --> 22:12.324
but I'd say rattle around some little
cracker box half mile off the ground

22:12.358 --> 22:13.725
is the worst part of any day.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.361
Hold on.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.063
Eungard and I
are gonna head out.

22:18.097 --> 22:21.699
You stay here with, uh,
what's your name, captain?

22:21.733 --> 22:22.767
Me?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.236
You're the one flying the plane.

22:24.270 --> 22:27.239
Uh, Gary. Gary.

22:27.873 --> 22:32.211
Gary Gary. All right, you stay here
with Gary Gary and the dead weight.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.480
Eungard and I are gonna
check out the homestead.

22:34.513 --> 22:38.984
LeDuc, these bullet holes are...
are fucking filthy. He... he needs water.

22:39.018 --> 22:42.154
And I need him not to have
gotten shot in the fucking face.

22:42.188 --> 22:47.259
And I need you to have driven us to safety like
what a getaway driver supposed to fucking do.

22:49.495 --> 22:51.096
Eungard, let's go!

22:55.767 --> 22:56.902
Oh shit!

23:02.942 --> 23:05.477
I can't, can't.

23:06.946 --> 23:10.382
Listen, I know you got a problem
with the way I handled this.

23:10.416 --> 23:13.519
I am too old for this shit,
LeDuc. This is on you, mate.

23:13.552 --> 23:14.954
Oh, come on, man.

23:15.454 --> 23:17.122
I got us here alive, didn't I?

23:21.093 --> 23:21.961
All right.

23:23.195 --> 23:26.365
Okay, stay put, but, listen,
cell phones for shit out here.

23:27.166 --> 23:30.970
I'm gonna scope it out and as soon as I see
a landline, I'm calling Reicher in Denver.

23:31.537 --> 23:34.406
Pretty sure he's gonna want to hear
about a case full of first editions

23:34.440 --> 23:37.876
and I'm fucking positive that
he's got the capital.

23:39.044 --> 23:42.348
And if he's not interested,
I'm calling Bentley or Slick Mick,

23:42.381 --> 23:44.116
but we got options, baby.

23:44.149 --> 23:45.517
I'm not worried about the money.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.820
Don't call Reicher first.

23:50.289 --> 23:52.291
Call Slick Mick, mate.

24:00.032 --> 24:02.301
[LeDuc] All right, let's go.

24:05.604 --> 24:07.172
[Gary] You guys have keys?

24:22.154 --> 24:24.490
[woman] Don't know whether to
shoot you or thank you.

24:25.858 --> 24:28.394
On a count of three, you're
gonna drop to your knees

24:28.427 --> 24:31.297
and put them hands on that
bumper right in front of you.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.265
Right where I can see them.

24:34.066 --> 24:37.503
One, two, three.

24:42.341 --> 24:43.808
All right.

24:44.343 --> 24:47.579
Now, I want you to turn around,
stay on your knees,

24:47.613 --> 24:51.550
and all the while I want you to
keep them hands up palms out.

25:03.495 --> 25:04.930
Afternoon.

25:08.367 --> 25:09.568
I'm a stowaway.

25:11.136 --> 25:15.307
I hopped in back your pickup truck
outside the supply store at Sierra Vista.

25:16.175 --> 25:19.445
I mean you no harm. I was only
running from a little trouble.

25:20.679 --> 25:21.547
And...

25:23.148 --> 25:24.583
And...

25:24.616 --> 25:25.918
Why didn't you just
ask for a ride?

25:25.951 --> 25:29.054
Trouble was right behind me, Ma'am.
I didn't have time to ask.

25:29.488 --> 25:31.256
Now, I'm just trying to get
back on the road.

25:31.290 --> 25:34.026
I did not mean to come all the
way out here to your home, Ma'am.

25:34.059 --> 25:36.428
So that's why you're looking
to steal my rig?

25:36.462 --> 25:39.998
I'm not looking to steal it. I
just need a ride back to town.

25:40.599 --> 25:43.035
I'm happy to be on my way,
Ma'am. Honest.

25:43.068 --> 25:47.072
All you got to do is point me in
the right direction and I am gone.

25:47.106 --> 25:50.275
Really, I can disappear
like that.

25:50.309 --> 25:54.146
I've been doing it all my life.
I'm kind of an expert at it.

25:56.482 --> 25:59.618
All right, cool hand. Go ahead
and stand up.

26:03.956 --> 26:04.757
Okay.

26:06.492 --> 26:08.560
You're a
good guy in a bad situation.

26:09.395 --> 26:10.929
Let's say I buy it.

26:10.963 --> 26:13.198
How do we get you back to where
you belong?

26:13.232 --> 26:15.601
You let me give 30 minutes TLC
to your truck here,

26:15.634 --> 26:19.004
and you could take me back to
town by sundown.

26:19.037 --> 26:21.440
You can even stand there and watch
me the whole time if you want.

26:22.107 --> 26:25.010
Just, uh, don't shoot me.

26:25.444 --> 26:28.480
Don't worry, this gun can't
hurt you.

26:29.548 --> 26:31.183
You can put your hands down.

26:32.551 --> 26:36.488
We can head back to Tucson once you
fix her up, but I ain't driving.

26:37.189 --> 26:40.092
I ain't sticking around
to watch you fix her neither.

26:40.125 --> 26:44.563
I've seen this plane fly over,
it's over goddamn bullet.

26:45.197 --> 26:48.400
Must have touched down pretty
close, less than a mile I'd say.

26:48.434 --> 26:50.736
That means it landed
on my property

26:50.769 --> 26:53.105
and that means I got to
do the right thing

26:53.138 --> 26:56.275
and make sure everybody's safe
and all is well.

26:57.276 --> 27:00.379
Still, gotta be careful.

27:03.615 --> 27:04.650
Hey, girl.

27:06.685 --> 27:09.354
Guess I'm running my
keep around here after all.

27:11.023 --> 27:12.090
Yes, Sir.

27:12.124 --> 27:14.326
She sure seems like a good
old gal.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.503
Now this gun can hurt you.

27:24.536 --> 27:29.074
Tell you what, if I can't fix your truck, you
can shoot me. How's that for a guarantee?

27:30.709 --> 27:32.578
I get a feeling about people.

27:33.612 --> 27:36.415
Could usually get a pretty accurate
reading, five, ten minutes.

27:36.448 --> 27:39.418
Well, if I can't fix her at least
she's got some pretty solid tires.

27:41.787 --> 27:43.155
Don't prove me wrong.

28:44.249 --> 28:45.551
[knocking on door]

29:22.321 --> 29:23.355
[LeDuc] Stay put.

29:32.331 --> 29:34.433
[knocking on door]

29:39.805 --> 29:41.540
[man] Get you off the
ground. Come on.

29:55.922 --> 30:00.258
When LeDuc comes back out, you
kill him. You kill him.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.728
No. Tommy, I can't.

30:02.761 --> 30:05.464
I can't take care of you by
myself. I need him.

30:05.497 --> 30:08.767
He's going to kill us both.
You have to kill him.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.535
Tommy, just breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

30:23.382 --> 30:25.517
[opening and closing truck door]

30:25.550 --> 30:28.553
[truck starting up]

30:31.958 --> 30:33.558
[LeDuc] Goddamn it!

30:35.862 --> 30:38.563
Fuck! Damn it.

30:38.597 --> 30:41.667
Fuck! Get over here will you?

30:41.700 --> 30:42.567
[man] What?

30:43.435 --> 30:44.803
[LeDuc]
You know anything about cars?

30:44.837 --> 30:46.204
[man] Just how to drive them.

30:46.238 --> 30:47.706
[LeDuc] Oh, yeah. You're
sure about that?

30:48.941 --> 30:52.377
Oh, yeah? Well, what the fuck
happened, LeDuc, huh?

30:52.411 --> 30:53.779
Nothing can go wrong.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.515
We're gonna be in and out,
drinking tequila at sunset in Phoenix.

30:56.548 --> 30:58.283
Does that ring any bells?

30:58.316 --> 31:02.721
Hundred grand each by
sunset. What the fuck happened?

31:02.754 --> 31:05.357
[LeDuc] They got to Harry,
must've.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.725
[man] And how do you know that?

31:06.758 --> 31:10.395
[LeDuc] If there were police
involved, they got to him, trust me.

31:10.429 --> 31:13.632
I don't trust you, that's
the thing, okay?

31:14.332 --> 31:15.701
[LeDuc] Well, good for you.

31:20.372 --> 31:22.474
[man] So, so what? So what?

31:22.507 --> 31:24.276
You're just gonna make some
phone calls

31:24.309 --> 31:25.978
and you're gonna get us
out of here, is that it?

31:26.012 --> 31:26.879
Yes.

31:28.480 --> 31:32.018
This sort of thing may not be in your
wheelhouse McBride, but it is what I do.

31:32.051 --> 31:33.719
You think Harry's the only one
in the business?

31:33.752 --> 31:39.791
And let's be clear, we each got a hundred
grand sitting in that plane in a brown case.

31:39.826 --> 31:41.393
And I'll tell you something
else,

31:41.426 --> 31:44.796
we'd each have a hundred and thirty-three
grand if it was for that sack of shit.

31:44.831 --> 31:47.867
I'm not just gonna let him
fucking die here, okay?

31:47.900 --> 31:49.634
Oh, come on, man.

31:50.702 --> 31:52.337
He's not gonna make it.

31:52.370 --> 31:53.705
Look at his face.

31:56.808 --> 31:59.478
And what the hell are we gonna
do about it all the way out here?

32:17.596 --> 32:19.765
<i>Fiesta en mi casa</i>.

32:20.499 --> 32:21.366
Fuck.

32:22.869 --> 32:26.939
Ah, shit. Fuck.

32:36.883 --> 32:38.483
Office time.

32:42.121 --> 32:44.489
Here. Here.

32:46.525 --> 32:49.829
[whistling]

32:54.867 --> 32:56.102
[music playing]

32:56.135 --> 32:58.670
[man on radio] <i>And the next
thing I knew, I met Marla...</i>

33:00.605 --> 33:03.675
- [changing stations]
- [man] <i>To attempt the brazen daylight plane jacking.</i>

33:03.708 --> 33:07.479
<i>The aircraft was last seen heading south
though the current whereabouts remain unknown.</i>

33:07.512 --> 33:09.849
<i>It is believed that this
hijacking is directly connected</i>

33:09.882 --> 33:13.052
<i>to the theft of nearly a dozen rare
books from a private collection</i>

33:13.085 --> 33:14.854
<i>valued at
over four million dollars.</i>

33:14.887 --> 33:17.056
<i>Five servicemen were killed in
the robbery</i>

33:17.089 --> 33:20.592
<i>which occurred at approximately 11:10 AM
near the scene of the roll-over crash.</i>

33:20.625 --> 33:23.562
<i>Chief of Police Kenneth Prescott held
a press conference this afternoon</i>

33:23.595 --> 33:25.164
<i>outlining the
department's next steps.</i>

33:25.198 --> 33:28.767
<i>The FBI will be joining the hunt as
Mr. Gary Mueller's possible kidnapping</i>

33:28.800 --> 33:30.669
<i>makes this a federal issue.</i>

33:38.510 --> 33:41.013
[LeDuc] <i>Yeah, well Harry can
go fuck himself.</i>

33:41.047 --> 33:42.982
I know it's a tall order,

33:43.015 --> 33:47.452
but look... look what you
stand to gain, you see?

33:48.855 --> 33:51.456
Yeah, I don't know, somewhere in
Arizona.

33:54.927 --> 34:00.432
Well, listen. We'll be
in Mexico by sundown 100%.

34:04.469 --> 34:06.105
Look, the table's set, man.

34:06.138 --> 34:07.672
You want in on this or not?

34:07.706 --> 34:09.909
I can make a
call to Bentley tomorrow.

34:20.819 --> 34:23.455
We're
back in business, big time.

34:24.456 --> 34:25.958
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

34:25.992 --> 34:28.726
We got our money and then some.

34:29.661 --> 34:33.665
Y'all just need to have a little faith
in old LeDuc. He'll take care of you.

34:33.697 --> 34:37.168
Yeah, well I need to take care of him right
now. I don't give a shit about the money.

34:38.570 --> 34:39.571
Aw!

34:49.781 --> 34:51.516
[shooting]

34:56.521 --> 34:58.090
Get the fuck down!

35:02.094 --> 35:02.962
Fuck.

35:05.664 --> 35:07.900
[woman] Listen real good boys,

35:07.934 --> 35:12.905
I've got a scope rifle and I can get off
three shots in less than two seconds.

35:12.939 --> 35:14.273
I'm going to count to three

35:14.307 --> 35:18.244
and you're going to toss them as
far as you can out into the yard.

35:18.277 --> 35:22.148
One, two, three.

35:32.757 --> 35:33.826
Shit!

35:33.859 --> 35:35.962
What with all this
activity today,

35:35.995 --> 35:39.631
you think I'd taken out a full-page
color in the <i>Desert Herald</i>

35:39.664 --> 35:43.568
advertising this place as
a goddamn bed-and-breakfast.

35:43.601 --> 35:46.205
Does this look like a
bed-and-breakfast to you fellas?

35:48.207 --> 35:49.208
No, Ma'am.

35:49.241 --> 35:51.043
[woman] No, Ma'am, indeed.

35:51.844 --> 35:55.014
Hope you don't mind my not
offering to bring out the iced tea.

35:55.047 --> 35:59.818
I mean requesting your story,
the shortest, plainest, truest version

35:59.852 --> 36:03.956
of how you came to be here armed
and trespassing on my land.

36:03.990 --> 36:06.225
[LeDuc]
Ma'am, my name is Raymond Fuchs

36:06.258 --> 36:10.795
and I want to offer a sincere apology
for inconvenience to you like this.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.933
You see my... my friend Peter and I we...
we chartered a flight

36:13.966 --> 36:18.004
to do some hunting, quail and
pheasant, mostly,

36:18.037 --> 36:21.307
and wouldn't you know it, en route our
plane suffered some major engine trouble

36:21.340 --> 36:24.176
and we had to do an emergency
landing right over the horizon there.

36:24.210 --> 36:27.113
And on our way down we
saw your house.

36:27.146 --> 36:31.017
We thought maybe there was a phone
line, or some assistance to be had.

36:31.683 --> 36:36.821
Hunting pheasant and quail? Those weapons
are pretty tactical for pheasant and quail.

36:38.157 --> 36:39.291
You don't say.

36:40.126 --> 36:44.196
Well, we're sort of new this
thing, I mean.

36:44.930 --> 36:45.998
So, how about it, Ma'am?

36:46.032 --> 36:48.901
We laid down our arms,
maybe you could do the same?

36:49.634 --> 36:53.172
I mean, the quicker we can get a hold of someone,
the quicker we can be out of your hair?

36:57.209 --> 36:58.810
All right, don't shoot her.

37:01.013 --> 37:05.951
Well, the truck's fucked, but good
news, you're right about Slick Mick.

37:05.985 --> 37:10.156
Put it down, lady. Just
real, real slow.

37:22.767 --> 37:24.170
Good to have you back, man.

37:25.071 --> 37:28.573
Oh, I got tired of
waiting. Good, heh?

37:29.774 --> 37:33.212
All right, Little House on the Prairie,
what time is your husband due back?

37:34.113 --> 37:35.347
Okay, your boyfriend.

37:37.149 --> 37:41.353
Oh, I see. You're one of those
liberated ladies, aren't you?

37:41.387 --> 37:44.156
Homesteading out
here all by your lonesome.

37:44.190 --> 37:47.359
You don't need no man to get the
job done, right?

37:47.393 --> 37:48.760
[Eungard] Up you go, big fella.

37:57.970 --> 38:00.605
Inside, inside.

38:45.951 --> 38:47.052
[Peter] Where the hell are we?

38:47.086 --> 38:50.256
[woman] Cochise County. If it
means anything to you.

38:50.289 --> 38:51.957
How close to Mexico?

38:51.991 --> 38:52.925
[woman] About 20 miles.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.960
[LeDuc] What's the word
on that truck outside?

38:54.994 --> 38:57.695
[woman] If that's plan A,
you might want to consider a plan B.

38:58.931 --> 39:00.099
Look, you don't understand.

39:00.132 --> 39:02.301
I'm gonna take
care of your friend there.

39:02.334 --> 39:05.271
- I'm a registered nurse.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a nurse. We get that.

39:05.304 --> 39:08.974
The only problem with your logic is
he is most definitely not our friend.

39:09.008 --> 39:11.210
Now, is there anyone else that
lives around here?

39:11.243 --> 39:13.412
- [woman] No.
- [LeDuc] Oh yeah?

39:17.082 --> 39:21.187
What about that big old
house over there?

39:23.189 --> 39:25.891
That's where I used to live when
I had a family.

39:27.259 --> 39:28.726
Now, I live here.

39:29.761 --> 39:30.728
You through?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.168
Now, listen up.

39:36.202 --> 39:39.305
Get the rubbing alcohol and
whiskey from under the sink.

39:39.338 --> 39:41.840
He's got a bunch of glass deep
in his face.

39:42.374 --> 39:46.445
You, make him drink
more water, give him Ibuprofen.

39:46.478 --> 39:50.282
And somebody boil
some goddamn water.

39:50.950 --> 39:51.951
Boy scouts.

39:54.987 --> 39:57.489
[LeDuc] Let's go outside and do
a perimeter check.

39:57.523 --> 40:01.260
Let's not trust the old fucking
bitch. Hmm, come on.

40:04.796 --> 40:07.099
Look man, I think she's telling
the truth.

40:07.132 --> 40:08.800
When me and that
McBride asshole came up,

40:08.834 --> 40:10.970
we didn't see anyone over that
way or anywhere.

40:11.003 --> 40:12.338
[Eungard] All right, so listen.

40:12.371 --> 40:15.341
We're not getting out of doing
a bloody perimeter check, mate.

40:15.374 --> 40:16.242
We got a problem.

40:17.409 --> 40:19.311
If they're looking south,
they're coming right at us.

40:19.345 --> 40:22.147
And we got a 36-foot get away
plane, in plain fucking sight.

40:22.181 --> 40:24.782
The South is a big place, okay?

40:25.317 --> 40:26.885
They're not gonna know exactly
where we're at.

40:26.919 --> 40:30.856
- It's fucking close enough.
- Okay, well that's what I'm trying to tell you.

40:30.889 --> 40:33.092
- I got a fucking solution.
- [Eungard] Yeah?

40:33.125 --> 40:34.827
[LeDuc] Del Rio, Texas.

40:34.860 --> 40:38.364
- What?
- It's a border crossing built right on a goddamn dam.

40:38.397 --> 40:40.099
The Rio Grande River.

40:40.132 --> 40:42.134
Slick Mick was
telling me all about it.

40:42.167 --> 40:45.237
Anytime he needed something brought
into the U.S. that's where it went down.

40:46.005 --> 40:47.606
[Eungard] I'm not buying that.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.876
Well, neither do I man but it's a plan,
you know, something to hang our head on.

40:51.343 --> 40:55.514
All we need to do is get our asses
the last 20 miles to Mexico, tonight.

40:56.482 --> 40:57.516
[woman] <i>What's your name?</i>

40:58.183 --> 40:59.084
Aaron.

40:59.118 --> 41:02.021
Aaron, I need you to
go wash your hands.

41:18.904 --> 41:20.205
[Aaron] What's wrong with him?

41:20.239 --> 41:22.041
There we go. Just a lot of pain.

41:22.074 --> 41:24.343
Okay. I've got a job for you.

41:25.144 --> 41:29.915
I need you to take this, tie the sleeves
together to make a sling for his arm.

41:30.449 --> 41:31.450
What's his name?

41:31.483 --> 41:32.885
[Aaron] Tommy.

41:32.918 --> 41:37.356
[woman] Tommy, listen up,
your brother's making a sling for your arm.

41:37.389 --> 41:40.592
I gotta clean out the wounds on your
face now, it's gonna really hurt.

41:47.933 --> 41:49.234
What about the lady?

41:49.268 --> 41:52.104
[Tommy moaning]

41:54.039 --> 41:57.910
We just tie her up and leave her
some food.

41:58.977 --> 42:00.512
I guess
we don't need to kill her.

42:02.948 --> 42:04.483
We just need a head start, mate.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.626
Gary, Gary, you're up next.

42:15.494 --> 42:16.562
He dead yet?

42:18.964 --> 42:21.633
Oh shit. You're good
at it, Gary Gary.

42:22.634 --> 42:23.535
You did it.

42:23.569 --> 42:24.770
This is not a good idea.

42:24.803 --> 42:28.574
Regular unleaded gasoline is
too low octane for aviation.

42:28.607 --> 42:31.276
The chances of vapor lock are
too high.

42:31.310 --> 42:32.978
What does vapor lock mean?

42:33.011 --> 42:35.381
What the fuck do I know.
It'll get us in the air.

43:00.072 --> 43:03.041
[man on radio] <i>Hey, partner
where'd you get those boots?</i>

43:26.231 --> 43:27.466
[Aaron] They don't believe you.

43:29.001 --> 43:30.602
That's what they're talking
about right now.

43:33.005 --> 43:34.373
[woman]
They don't believe me what?

43:36.175 --> 43:39.711
None of it. Not that you don't live alone, not
that no one else is coming along, nothing.

43:42.080 --> 43:46.151
[woman] Suppose y'all didn't believe me either
when I said I could fix up your brother here.

43:50.689 --> 43:52.724
You... do you think he's...
he's gonna die?

43:54.193 --> 43:55.093
[woman] Maybe.

43:56.495 --> 43:59.064
We'll buy him some time
once I'm through here.

44:00.466 --> 44:03.235
As long as we get all this glass
and buckshot out,

44:04.236 --> 44:07.172
he's gonna be just fine.

44:10.209 --> 44:11.543
You're in my light again.

44:13.745 --> 44:15.481
Those other fellas,
you know them?

44:15.514 --> 44:16.381
What?

44:17.516 --> 44:21.053
Those other fellas you came here
with, the older ones.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.754
You know them well?

44:23.755 --> 44:25.390
What's it... what's it to you?

44:25.424 --> 44:26.758
Nothing, I suppose.

44:27.426 --> 44:29.294
I'm just
trying to make conversation.

44:30.496 --> 44:33.599
Been a while since I had to
practice my bedside manner.

44:33.632 --> 44:34.533
Your what?

44:35.801 --> 44:40.572
Look, I don't know what you boys
did or what you're running from,

44:40.606 --> 44:45.244
but if y'all ain't on the same page now,
the immediate future don't look too bright.

44:47.579 --> 44:49.314
You think they're
gonna kill him?

44:50.850 --> 44:52.351
They're bad men.

44:52.384 --> 44:54.419
[phone ringing]

44:55.754 --> 44:58.757
I don't think they have your
brother's best interests in mind.

45:02.628 --> 45:04.096
You want me to get that?

45:08.868 --> 45:09.735
[Aaron] All right.

45:11.737 --> 45:14.106
Stand up. Sit in the chair.

45:14.139 --> 45:16.174
- [woman] Seriously?
- [Aaron] Sit in the chair.

45:16.208 --> 45:17.977
[woman]
<i>Please record your message.</i>

45:18.011 --> 45:22.714
[man] <i>Hello there little lady. This is Sam
here and Billy, you know, your partner,</i>

45:22.748 --> 45:24.216
<i>the one in the car with you.</i>

45:24.249 --> 45:27.586
<i>And that goddamn forest fire was
ain't nothing more than a blaze.</i>

45:27.619 --> 45:29.187
<i>You could have just peed on it.</i>

45:29.221 --> 45:33.091
<i>Anyway, we were thinking about stopping
by on our way past your spread,</i>

45:33.125 --> 45:34.827
<i>maybe help you out with that
wire fencing,</i>

45:34.861 --> 45:36.662
<i>maybe take some of your money
and cards,</i>

45:36.695 --> 45:39.097
<i>or maybe just knock back a
couple of beers.</i>

45:39.131 --> 45:42.100
<i>We're 18. See
you soon. Love you.</i>

45:42.134 --> 45:43.068
[beeping]

45:43.101 --> 45:45.337
[LeDuc] All right, El Capitan
upsie-daisy.

45:48.373 --> 45:50.877
Oh shit! Fuck me.

45:50.910 --> 45:53.145
Déjà vu, huh, Gary Gary.

45:53.178 --> 45:55.647
Feels like it's been 10 years we've
been through so much together.

45:59.852 --> 46:02.688
In the hole Gary Gary,
in the hole.

46:25.277 --> 46:26.445
Oh shit,

46:27.346 --> 46:28.447
"Oh shit" what?

46:29.648 --> 46:31.483
- [LeDuc] Don't know where the keys are?
- [Gary] No.

46:31.516 --> 46:33.352
- [LeDuc] Yeah.
- [Gary] Let me figure it out.

46:33.385 --> 46:36.154
- [LeDuc] Gary Gary...
- [Gary] Give me a second.

46:36.188 --> 46:37.857
- [Gary] Where are the keys?
- [LeDuc] Come out.

46:37.890 --> 46:40.827
[LeDuc] Hey, come here.
Keys, motherfucker!

47:03.883 --> 47:05.283
[LeDuc] Got another one on deck.

47:05.317 --> 47:07.819
I must have dropped it on the way here.
I swear I don't have them.

47:07.854 --> 47:09.521
[Aaron]
What happened? Are we leaving?

47:09.554 --> 47:14.426
This piece of shit sabotaged
us. He hid the goddamn keys.

47:14.459 --> 47:16.595
I didn't take the keys!

47:16.628 --> 47:18.430
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

47:18.463 --> 47:20.165
[LeDuc] <i>You took the keys.</i>

47:20.198 --> 47:22.567
[Gary] <i>I didn't take them. How many
times do I have to tell you? I didn't...</i>

47:22.601 --> 47:24.636
- [Gary] <i>I'm serious.</i>
- [LeDuc] <i>Where are the keys?</i>

47:24.670 --> 47:26.705
[Gary] <i>I want to get out
of here as well.</i>

47:26.738 --> 47:28.875
[LeDuc] <i>Where are they? Did you
throw them in the field?</i>

47:28.908 --> 47:31.677
[Eungard] <i>Go find them in the
trunk or find them in...</i>

47:31.710 --> 47:33.345
[Gary] <i>I don't know
where the keys are!</i>

47:33.378 --> 47:35.180
[LeDuc] <i>Maybe they're in
his fucking ass.</i>

47:36.314 --> 47:37.649
<i>I think we should check
your ass, Gary.</i>

47:37.683 --> 47:40.352
- [Gary] <i>What are you talking about?</i>
- [LeDuc] <i>There's no end.</i>

47:40.385 --> 47:42.354
[Gary] <i>I put the keys in
my ass, what a great idea.</i>

47:42.387 --> 47:44.589
[Aaron] <i>Wait, can't we just
hot wire the fucking plane?</i>

47:44.623 --> 47:47.225
[LeDuc] <i>Oh, Jesus! You don't
think I asked him that?</i>

47:48.293 --> 47:49.528
[Aaron] <i>Just an idea.</i>

47:49.561 --> 47:51.931
[LeDuc] <i>And what's with all this</i>
Grey's Anatomy <i>shit?</i>

47:51.964 --> 47:54.901
<i>If you could do her job, why is
she still breathing?</i>

47:54.934 --> 47:56.268
[woman] <i>I'm telling you fellas,</i>

47:56.301 --> 48:00.238
if I don't clean his face and
change the bandages on the regular,

48:00.272 --> 48:03.241
he's gonna get infected. Not
much I can do at that point.

48:03.275 --> 48:07.345
Yeah, well none of that matters.
We got the FBI after us.

48:07.379 --> 48:09.281
We can't hide the plane.

48:09.314 --> 48:12.317
He's shot in the fucking face
and we got no way out of here.

48:12.350 --> 48:13.318
What does that leave us?

48:13.351 --> 48:16.923
[Eungard] We got two hostages,
two witnesses.

48:16.956 --> 48:19.491
Somebody called
while you guys were gone.

48:19.524 --> 48:22.260
They... they're like
Park Rangers or something.

48:22.294 --> 48:24.396
They said that they're gonna
come in and pay her a visit.

48:28.467 --> 48:29.668
[LeDuc] What's he talking about?

48:31.137 --> 48:34.339
[woman] Got a couple of BLM Ranger
friends stop by from time to time.

48:34.372 --> 48:35.440
[LeDuc] When are they coming?

48:35.474 --> 48:38.243
Didn't say. It's pretty casual
around here, mister.

48:38.978 --> 48:40.779
Let me ask you a question.

48:40.812 --> 48:43.381
If you had a full tank of gas,
where'd you be heading?

48:43.415 --> 48:44.316
Mexico?

48:44.349 --> 48:46.384
I can get you
there through the canyon.

48:46.418 --> 48:48.553
I'm real familiar with the
country around here.

48:48.587 --> 48:49.821
[LeDuc] Oh, yeah?

48:49.856 --> 48:52.024
You got some magical
flying carpet?

48:52.691 --> 48:56.294
Or are we each gonna take turns dragging
his ass across the fucking desert?

48:56.328 --> 48:59.498
Sounds good to me. Staying here's no good.
You already know that.

48:59.531 --> 49:00.766
All right, everybody outside.

49:00.799 --> 49:04.269
- He's not done. He needs more bandages.
- He's fine. Get out.

49:07.006 --> 49:09.341
- [Eungard] Excuse me.
- [LeDuc] Shut up.

49:09.374 --> 49:10.977
Wakey-wakey, Quasimodo.

49:13.345 --> 49:14.279
See this?

49:15.680 --> 49:18.383
- Keep an eye on two of them, all right? All right?
- [Tommy] Yes.

49:22.021 --> 49:25.091
[Aaron] So, what are we gonna do? Are we...
we can... carry him through the canyon?

49:25.124 --> 49:26.893
[LeDuc]
No, no. You're gonna carry him.

49:26.926 --> 49:29.028
[Aaron] If you wait till he
gets better, he can walk.

49:29.061 --> 49:32.430
[LeDuc] We don't have time to
wait. We got to hoof it, now.

49:32.464 --> 49:34.566
He's the
reason we're in this shit.

49:35.467 --> 49:37.469
[Aaron]
Well, he's still alive, LeDuc.

49:37.502 --> 49:40.705
[LeDuc] Yeah, I get that but not for
very long. Have you seen his face lately?

49:40.739 --> 49:43.308
It's a long fucking road.
I don't want to carry this fucking...

49:43.976 --> 49:46.444
- What else are we gonna do?
- [Aaron] Fix the fucking truck.

49:46.478 --> 49:48.014
[LeDuc]
Do you know how to fix a truck?

49:48.047 --> 49:49.849
[Aaron]
We're gonna walk into Mexico?

49:51.583 --> 49:54.519
- [LeDuc] Why is he trying to...
- [Aaron] What if she just walks us to the border patrol?

49:54.553 --> 49:56.989
[Aaron muttering]

49:57.023 --> 49:59.457
[LeDuc] Exactly. Okay.

49:59.959 --> 50:02.028
[LeDuc muttering]

50:02.061 --> 50:03.830
[Aaron] Camped in the desert.

50:03.863 --> 50:08.667
[muttering]

50:08.700 --> 50:11.871
[LeDuc] We just need to get through the
fucking canyon and get to Mexico, no problem.

50:11.904 --> 50:14.372
- [LeDuc] What's wrong with the truck?
- [Aaron] Don't know.

50:14.406 --> 50:15.908
- [LeDuc] Hey, listen...
- Psst.

50:15.942 --> 50:17.877
[muttering]

50:17.910 --> 50:19.245
Who the fuck is that?

50:19.278 --> 50:21.981
- [LeDuc] Are you trying to get us somewhere?
- [Aaron] Let's do it.

50:23.015 --> 50:24.416
[LeDuc] What the fuck?

50:25.784 --> 50:29.521
All right, here's the news.
We're taking the old lady's advice.

50:29.554 --> 50:31.090
We're gonna hoof it
through the canyon.

50:31.123 --> 50:33.960
[Tommy] What's your name, Ma'am?

50:34.927 --> 50:35.828
Eden.

50:36.761 --> 50:39.832
[Tommy] Do you know the way
to Mexico, Eden?

50:40.665 --> 50:42.001
[Eden] Indeed, I do.

50:42.634 --> 50:45.804
[Tommy] Correct me
if I'm wrong, Eden,

50:46.638 --> 50:50.408
but I thought I heard some
cattle roaming on your property.

50:50.442 --> 50:51.376
[Eden] That's right.

50:52.377 --> 50:54.981
[Tommy] And where there's cows,
there's horses.

50:55.948 --> 50:58.483
[Eden] That's right,
four of them.

51:00.685 --> 51:02.021
Horses.

51:02.054 --> 51:03.155
Four of them.

51:03.189 --> 51:06.125
[LeDuc] Okay, hold on. We're
seriously discussing this.

51:06.758 --> 51:09.962
I'm sorry, mate. But do you
think that's such a bad idea?

51:12.999 --> 51:13.866
Yes.

51:14.666 --> 51:16.635
Okay, well
what do you suggest we do?

51:16.668 --> 51:18.536
Hijack another fucking plane?

51:18.570 --> 51:21.140
That is the best plan
I've heard all day.

51:21.173 --> 51:23.775
Says who?
Says the soon-to-be corpse?

51:23.808 --> 51:26.112
[Tommy] It's so crazy, it
might just work.

51:26.145 --> 51:27.545
He's so crazy, he
might be right.

51:27.579 --> 51:29.614
Yeah, okay no. I give
the orders here.

51:29.648 --> 51:33.920
Your fucking orders, mate, got
us here. All right?

51:34.686 --> 51:37.455
She can get us out.

51:39.624 --> 51:41.060
Four horses, right?

51:41.093 --> 51:43.095
- [Eden] That's right.
- [Eungard] Yeah.

51:43.129 --> 51:48.633
The McBride boys here can have one
and there's one for each of us, right?

51:49.235 --> 51:51.736
You got keys to the
house over the way?

51:53.172 --> 51:54.040
I do.

51:55.207 --> 51:56.175
Horses.

51:57.076 --> 51:58.576
[LeDuc] <i>Who do I ride with?</i>

51:58.610 --> 52:00.179
[Eungard] <i>Shut up.</i>

52:00.212 --> 52:03.916
<i>Listen, mate. Snap out of it, a way out
of here is just what we fucking need.</i>

52:03.950 --> 52:06.551
<i>Now which of you
idiots tied these fucking ropes?</i>

52:06.584 --> 52:07.853
[LeDuc] <i>Take one guess.</i>

52:07.887 --> 52:10.156
[Aaron] <i>I was trying to make
sure that she didn't escape.</i>

52:10.189 --> 52:13.092
[LeDuc] <i>Oh, is that right? It's
a fucking mess, Boy Scout.</i>

52:13.125 --> 52:14.894
[Tommy] <i>Excuse me guys, who am
I gonna ride with?</i>

52:14.927 --> 52:18.530
[LeDuc] <i>We're gonna hog-tie your cheeseburger
ass and drag you all the way there.</i>

52:18.563 --> 52:19.497
<i>How does that sound?</i>

52:19.531 --> 52:21.599
[Eungard]
<i>Okay, all right? You, get up.</i>

52:22.101 --> 52:25.071
<i>You come to McBride and make sure
she doesn't fuck with the horses.</i>

52:27.672 --> 52:29.041
[Eden] Not much to it, fellas.

52:29.075 --> 52:31.844
I'm just gonna throw some saddles on
them, and we'll be together.

52:32.744 --> 52:34.512
It's smart to take a look at
the shoes though.

52:34.546 --> 52:36.715
Lady, you just don't get it, do
you? We're in a hurry.

52:36.748 --> 52:38.516
Do the least amount you got to
fucking do.

52:38.550 --> 52:39.218
Fine.

52:39.885 --> 52:41.053
How long are we talking?

52:41.087 --> 52:42.254
20, 30 minutes.

52:42.288 --> 52:44.056
No, to Mexico.

52:44.090 --> 52:46.491
That it will be this
time tomorrow.

52:46.993 --> 52:49.527
So, sundown tomorrow,

52:49.561 --> 52:54.599
we'll be drinking tequila just like I said,
McBride, only Mexico, instead of Phoenix.

52:55.267 --> 52:56.135
Hell,

52:57.370 --> 53:01.606
tequila with a dirty side of
Mexican snatch, crabs be damned.

53:03.142 --> 53:06.678
Hey, Eden, where can a guy get
some rubbers on the way?

53:07.880 --> 53:10.216
Is there a 7/11 around here?

53:10.249 --> 53:11.816
I can't help you with that.

53:11.851 --> 53:13.886
Fuck, knock it off. Give
us the keys, toots.

53:14.652 --> 53:17.923
Nothing in there. Just a house I
used to live out with my daughter.

53:17.957 --> 53:19.458
Oh, fuck.

53:19.492 --> 53:23.695
Lady I'm really sorry to, you know,
walk all over your nostalgia trip here,

53:23.728 --> 53:26.232
but if you don't play Paul,
I'll knock the fucking door down,

53:26.265 --> 53:28.633
so give me the
fucking keys, now!

53:33.039 --> 53:34.073
That's better.

53:35.607 --> 53:36.741
Fucking bitch.

53:38.878 --> 53:42.882
Twenty minutes, Dr. Quinn, and
I'm holding you to that.

53:45.251 --> 53:46.152
This way.

54:09.341 --> 54:11.343
Looks like you got yourselves a
plan then?

54:12.178 --> 54:14.847
Riding out on
horseback into the sunset

54:16.148 --> 54:19.852
but that's something you never thought you'd
actually be doing for real now, it is?

54:20.286 --> 54:21.287
[Aaron] I guess not.

54:22.687 --> 54:24.090
[Eden] You ever ride before?

54:24.924 --> 54:25.790
[Aaron] No.

54:26.826 --> 54:30.196
Well, not much to it.

54:31.430 --> 54:34.066
I'll teach you everything you
need to know in no time.

54:34.100 --> 54:37.369
Come on now, scoot
on over. There you go.

54:38.304 --> 54:39.972
Give it a rest will ya?

54:40.005 --> 54:43.409
Horses, carriages.
Who gives a shit how we get there?

54:43.442 --> 54:46.879
That giant turd can't run the show like that,
man. He's going to start giving us orders.

54:46.912 --> 54:49.115
He's not giving us orders, mate.

54:49.148 --> 54:52.650
He just made a suggestion which
is a pretty fucking good one.

54:52.684 --> 54:56.989
Yeah, well in my experience, you let a guy like
that call a shot, he's gonna call another.

54:59.824 --> 55:01.293
Look,
all I know is when we get there,

55:01.327 --> 55:05.730
we're doing what I say, when I say,
and nobody fucks with that. All right?

55:06.731 --> 55:07.399
Right.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.206
And you think we're gonna
make it by tonight?

55:15.141 --> 55:16.308
Of course, we will.

55:17.009 --> 55:19.078
A 20-mile ride ain't shit.

55:19.811 --> 55:22.848
Hell, I've been camping on the
range 20 days stretch before.

55:23.781 --> 55:25.683
It's once we
make it what concerns me.

55:27.052 --> 55:28.854
What's your plans for after?

55:30.456 --> 55:31.857
Between you and me,

55:31.891 --> 55:35.361
I don't think those other fellas
know much more about it than you.

55:35.394 --> 55:37.897
We'll just
take it day by day.

55:38.864 --> 55:42.767
Hour by hour,
more like. Small goals.

55:45.838 --> 55:47.840
You think Tommy's gonna make
it through the night?

55:49.241 --> 55:50.376
[Eden] Of course, he will.

55:51.809 --> 55:55.080
As far as head injuries go, it really
ain't that bad believe it or not.

55:55.114 --> 55:59.051
Once we clean his face again before
nightfall, he'll be sitting pretty.

56:05.324 --> 56:09.061
Take it easy, mate. You're talking
like we're already in Mexico.

56:10.095 --> 56:12.298
Yeah, well, there's a lot
to do when we get there.

56:12.331 --> 56:17.937
Yeah, but let's get to Mexico first. There's
still a lot to do here, too, you know.

56:18.437 --> 56:20.039
What? Are you talking
about Gary Gary?

56:24.977 --> 56:26.845
I'm talking about every
fucking thing.

56:26.879 --> 56:29.882
The McBride idiot with the
fucking shit in his face,

56:29.915 --> 56:33.852
the nurse woman riding a horse
through a desert.

56:33.886 --> 56:36.021
You ever done that? Hmm?

56:43.062 --> 56:47.399
All I'm saying is we got a lot to
think about before Del Rio and the dam.

56:48.033 --> 56:52.137
And, yes, that
includes the fucking pilot.

56:57.943 --> 56:59.211
[Tommy] Ah!

56:59.945 --> 57:00.812
Fuck.

57:01.447 --> 57:02.481
Shit.

57:13.158 --> 57:14.759
What the fuck was that?

57:23.302 --> 57:24.270
Tommy.

57:24.303 --> 57:26.238
- [Tommy] Yeah, I missed. Argh!
- [LeDuc] Shit.

57:43.589 --> 57:44.923
[LeDuc] Goddamn it!

57:44.957 --> 57:46.191
Argh!

57:48.093 --> 57:48.994
Fuck.

57:49.028 --> 57:50.863
Keep your eye on that
bitch in the barn!

58:30.169 --> 58:31.236
Fuck!

58:36.508 --> 58:37.543
Gary.

58:43.549 --> 58:45.084
I see you.

59:26.392 --> 59:27.459
Ooh!

59:28.494 --> 59:30.295
Ooh. Gary.

59:31.296 --> 59:32.498
Ey!

59:38.404 --> 59:39.304
Okay.

59:40.372 --> 59:42.107
Ah!

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.694
Found you.

01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:09.334
Don't even try it. I'll shred you with
this before you turn around in there.

01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:12.104
Now, come on. Move. Let's go.

01:00:20.779 --> 01:00:23.482
Gary, what is this?

01:00:24.116 --> 01:00:25.451
Game of charades?

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:29.555
Ah? You, the cow, huh?

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:35.360
Gary, I want you to moo for me.

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:38.464
Hmm, moo!

01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:39.598
Gary,

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:44.770
if you don't moo for me,
I'm gonna brand you.

01:00:44.803 --> 01:00:48.440
There's someone else here.
It's not just Eden and me.

01:00:48.474 --> 01:00:50.476
What you talking about,
Gary Gary?

01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:56.014
He's hiding in the trailer. In the kitchen
closet. You don't believe me, ask her.

01:00:56.748 --> 01:00:59.251
That's who took the
keys from the plane.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.291
I'm through fucking around.

01:01:06.325 --> 01:01:08.193
Get your fucking ass out
of there now!

01:01:09.761 --> 01:01:11.230
Goddamn it. Gary, get your...

01:01:38.858 --> 01:01:40.626
[LeDuc] You say there's
someone out there.

01:01:40.659 --> 01:01:42.227
Well, we're gonna find out.

01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:47.366
Hey Eungard, bring that
woman out here.

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:48.267
Now.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.436
Eungard, you hear me?

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.672
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.642
I'm tired of this shit.

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:05.384
What the hell is this?

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:07.452
Wait till you hear what this
piece of shit just told me.

01:02:08.587 --> 01:02:09.488
Tell him.

01:02:10.656 --> 01:02:12.424
There's somebody
here besides her.

01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:14.293
What was that?

01:02:14.326 --> 01:02:17.763
There's somebody else here, a
ranch hand or somebody.

01:02:18.497 --> 01:02:21.400
- He's hiding in the kitchen.
- What's he talking about?

01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:22.301
I don't know,

01:02:24.169 --> 01:02:25.404
but we're gonna find out.

01:02:26.672 --> 01:02:27.773
Hey, hey, we need her.

01:02:27.806 --> 01:02:31.677
For what? To patch up McBride
piss-head number one?

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:35.614
Please, if there's someone here,
he's with her not with Gary Gary.

01:02:35.647 --> 01:02:37.616
He doesn't give a shit
about Gary Gary.

01:02:37.649 --> 01:02:39.685
We need her to lead us
out of here, mate.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:41.687
We go 20 miles that way.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.722
We don't need an atlas to get
there.

01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:45.357
All right,

01:02:46.358 --> 01:02:49.227
who's ever out
there, who's ever watching us,

01:02:50.462 --> 01:02:51.797
I'm calling your bluff.

01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:55.200
If you
don't show yourself right now,

01:02:55.835 --> 01:03:01.106
I'm gonna put a bullet where the
spine meets skull.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.544
Eungard, put
10 seconds on the clock, please.

01:03:08.513 --> 01:03:09.381
Ten,

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:12.284
nine,

01:03:13.619 --> 01:03:14.753
eight,

01:03:16.488 --> 01:03:17.656
seven,

01:03:18.624 --> 01:03:19.826
six,

01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:22.461
five...

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:23.795
[LeDuc] Five seconds left.

01:03:24.663 --> 01:03:26.598
You better be
right about this, Gary Gary,

01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:29.836
or she's gonna die
for no good reason.

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:33.372
Five,

01:03:34.706 --> 01:03:35.574
four,

01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:38.276
three,

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:41.313
two,

01:03:43.983 --> 01:03:44.851
one.

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:52.524
You fucking maniac!

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.327
You ask
before you shoot someone!

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.728
Oh, yeah?

01:03:58.131 --> 01:04:01.533
[Tommy] We don't have time for this,
friend, there's company coming.

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:08.273
Yeah, I got eyes too, lunatic.

01:04:09.608 --> 01:04:11.176
Who is that?

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:14.914
I think it's Billy and Sam coming to
play some gin rummy like I said earlier.

01:04:14.947 --> 01:04:17.683
- [Eungard] What are you doing?
- [LeDuc] Let's dump her in the rig.

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:20.452
Listen, you get
behind the tower,

01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:23.221
I'll hide in the barn and when
they get out, we'll gun them down.

01:04:23.255 --> 01:04:25.791
Don't kill my friends, please.

01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:27.459
I'll get rid of them.

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:30.897
Just let us play some cards
and drink a little bit.

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:32.031
And then I'll get rid of them.

01:04:32.065 --> 01:04:34.967
We can get on the horses and be
out of here in an hour.

01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:37.402
Fuck the horses, there's a
truck coming down the driveway.

01:04:37.436 --> 01:04:38.871
No, no. We're not changing
our minds.

01:04:38.905 --> 01:04:40.505
You wanted horses,
you got them.

01:04:40.539 --> 01:04:42.774
You do that again,
I'll shoot you myself.

01:04:45.777 --> 01:04:47.579
Do what you gotta do,
play your little game,

01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:49.448
drink your fucking drinks,
then they're gone.

01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:51.783
And put them in the house,
it looks like Omaha Beach in there.

01:04:52.818 --> 01:04:53.886
And we'll be watching you.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.422
You say anything about anything,
we'll gun them down.

01:04:57.456 --> 01:04:59.992
And that's on you. Come on.

01:05:19.745 --> 01:05:21.780
I'm with the kid, LeDuc, we
should take the truck.

01:05:21.813 --> 01:05:23.850
Of course we're taking
the truck, 100%.

01:05:23.883 --> 01:05:26.651
I told her what she wanted to hear
which is what you tell a woman.

01:05:26.685 --> 01:05:28.888
Hey that's my spot.
Get behind the couch.

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:47.572
Hey, little lady, looks like you
got our message in any case.

01:05:47.606 --> 01:05:51.878
Howdy boys, not many folks I'd want
to see two times as many hours.

01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:55.047
You know this guy hit every
pothole on the way in here.

01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:56.581
Get rolling, baby.

01:05:57.783 --> 01:05:58.885
You shut up.

01:05:58.918 --> 01:06:01.486
- Exactly.
- I've been driving since I was twelve.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.389
Yeah, you could have fooled me.
Hey, look what we brought.

01:06:04.422 --> 01:06:08.493
Ah, I can always count on you boys.
Follow me and we shall have beer.

01:06:08.527 --> 01:06:09.962
All right.

01:06:09.996 --> 01:06:10.863
Oh!

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:13.966
Now,
I didn't mention this earlier,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.637
but I have been having a serious cockroach
problem in that trailer over there.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.572
I smoked them out with some
poison gas

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:23.408
and I've been shacked up in
the old house since yesterday.

01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:25.878
- Backing up, huh?
- Hope you fellas don't mind.

01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:28.613
Sure, Eden. We don't mind.

01:06:28.647 --> 01:06:30.549
- Aw!
- As long as you're ready to lose.

01:06:30.582 --> 01:06:32.084
Yeah back at you.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:35.487
Want to do some strip poker?
Loosen up those buttons, baby.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.723
Okay, Billy, you mind yourself.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.770
[Eden] Of course, I'm always gladder
and shit to see you scoundrels,

01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:55.607
but we shouldn't be playing more
than three-four hands right now.

01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:59.344
Figured that'll give us enough
time to drain these bottles.

01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:04.884
Ain't no problem, little lady, if half hour's
what you got, half hour's what we'll take.

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:07.153
You needing to fix up a
fence. Is that about it?

01:07:07.186 --> 01:07:11.023
That's it truly. Having a hell
of a time finishing the job.

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:14.160
All sorts of distractions.

01:07:14.193 --> 01:07:16.595
Just ain't never enough time.

01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:17.696
[Eden] Never enough.

01:07:19.564 --> 01:07:22.567
Well, that's it for me boys, how about you?
What's the news?

01:07:23.102 --> 01:07:27.405
We were fit to fight a fire today,
but we're sorely disappointed.

01:07:27.439 --> 01:07:28.975
What does that even mean?

01:07:29.008 --> 01:07:31.177
You wanted
out of control inferno.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:36.448
Only good forest fire, ain't no forest
fire at all and that's just what we got.

01:07:36.481 --> 01:07:40.819
There ain't no real danger
around here. No real threat.

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:45.824
Oh, yeah? Why don't you tell Eden all
about the Haskells? There's some action.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:47.093
[Eden]
Oh-oh. Hank and Maggie?

01:07:48.727 --> 01:07:49.829
[Billy] You tell her.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:53.632
On our way back, figured we'd
stop off by Turkey Creek

01:07:53.665 --> 01:07:55.835
given that the campsites a
little once-over.

01:07:55.868 --> 01:08:01.140
Sure enough, Haskells are there,
big-ass RV taking up all that space.

01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:05.644
So, I was saying to Hank, you can't
be here longer than 14-day stretch.

01:08:05.677 --> 01:08:08.981
He and Maggie they just up and
leave. No problem.

01:08:09.015 --> 01:08:11.750
That's it? That's your story?

01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:13.286
Hell no.

01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:16.688
No sooner they leave we realize they
have been dumping their black water

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.590
not ten feet
from the creek bed.

01:08:18.622 --> 01:08:21.060
I guess they never got them
valves fixed.

01:08:21.093 --> 01:08:24.095
Can you believe that? Dumping
their greasy goddamn shit tank,

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.997
basically, right where the
fresh water is.

01:08:26.032 --> 01:08:29.868
Forest fire don't sound so bad
after something foul as all that.

01:08:47.886 --> 01:08:51.723
Tell you what, forget about that
fence, let's hit up Millie's.

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.827
Sing some of the Boss at
karaoke.

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:57.562
All you've got to do is
hop in your truck now.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:00.799
I'd love to, Sam, but that
bucket's been giving me hell again.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.868
It was good enough today.

01:09:02.902 --> 01:09:06.272
[Billy] Oh, you know, I know engines.
All you have to do is ask.

01:09:06.305 --> 01:09:09.841
Boys, I appreciate the help,
but I know how to handle myself.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:12.144
[Billy] That's nonsense.
We're here right now.

01:09:12.178 --> 01:09:14.546
Are you gonna wait for a
mechanic to come all the way?

01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:15.413
Sam.

01:09:15.448 --> 01:09:17.615
[Eden]
It ain't necessary. Come on now.

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:20.152
Pick up your card and let's
keep playing and drinking.

01:09:20.185 --> 01:09:21.921
Come on. You can't expect
me to just sit here

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:23.889
when there's work to be done.

01:09:23.923 --> 01:09:26.125
- [Eden] You're afraid of losing.
- Your tools in the truck?

01:09:26.158 --> 01:09:28.727
Have another drink.
Come on, now.

01:09:31.162 --> 01:09:32.999
[Eden] No!

01:09:33.032 --> 01:09:34.100
Oh, shit!

01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:48.546
[Billy]
Eden, you okay? Wait, wait!

01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:03.528
[Aaron] Tom, I'm scared.

01:10:04.296 --> 01:10:07.732
Oh the fuck,
I'm losing a lot of blood.

01:10:08.267 --> 01:10:10.936
I can... I can make it.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.904
I can make it.

01:10:11.937 --> 01:10:15.274
Just put me in the back
seat. I can make it.

01:10:16.308 --> 01:10:20.179
Just go get a blanket and...

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.282
Help me soak up
the blood and I just...

01:10:23.315 --> 01:10:25.084
I can make it to the hospital.

01:10:30.256 --> 01:10:31.756
[Tommy] Well, there it is.

01:10:52.777 --> 01:10:55.214
[LeDuc gasping]

01:10:55.247 --> 01:10:57.649
[Tommy] Who's the
deadweight now, LeDuc?

01:11:23.175 --> 01:11:24.877
It's just you and me now, Eden.

01:11:38.756 --> 01:11:40.159
Holy crap!

01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.245
Hmm.

01:12:37.883 --> 01:12:39.985
Follow the yellow brick road.

01:12:52.998 --> 01:12:53.999
Where is he?

01:12:55.935 --> 01:12:57.836
Don't know what you're asking.

01:13:09.215 --> 01:13:11.250
We're a package deal now, Eden.

01:13:13.219 --> 01:13:17.122
Like Hansel and Gretel following
the breadcrumbs.

01:13:23.262 --> 01:13:25.164
You lead the way, Gretel.

01:13:35.107 --> 01:13:35.975
Tough.

01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:28.827
[Tommy] Industrious.

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:54.553
You know there's only 22 known
copies of this in the whole world.

01:14:57.356 --> 01:15:01.093
Whoever gets their hands on it will
get up to three million dollars for it.

01:15:05.331 --> 01:15:08.100
Just don't seem fair what with
us doing all the work and all.

01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:12.037
[opera music playing]

01:15:58.584 --> 01:15:59.985
[Tommy] I don't like that.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.021
Who's going in first?

01:16:04.656 --> 01:16:06.892
I'll rock, paper,
scissors you for it.

01:16:07.493 --> 01:16:09.561
Hmm, I win.

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:15.267
Cold shoulder, after you.

01:16:20.339 --> 01:16:21.306
Go on.

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.779
Think of it like this, Eden.

01:16:26.812 --> 01:16:32.351
You're the King's servant, and you're tasting
the food to make sure it's not poisoned.

01:16:33.652 --> 01:16:35.521
I'm the king in that scenario.

01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:42.528
You're
doing a noble service, Eden.

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:44.296
Don't let anybody tell you
otherwise.

01:16:47.232 --> 01:16:48.100
Hold up.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.406
Doggone I'm forgetting my own
rules.

01:16:57.409 --> 01:17:02.314
We're a package deal Eden,
but you are going in first.

01:17:03.282 --> 01:17:07.252
[opera music still playing]

01:17:12.624 --> 01:17:13.659
[Tommy] Take that light.

01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:31.176
Classics.

01:17:40.085 --> 01:17:41.253
Turn that shit off.

01:17:48.093 --> 01:17:51.497
I had a feeling you were more of
a Bob Seger kind of guy.

01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:56.435
With all due respect, Sir,
kindly put your weapon down on the ground.

01:17:57.302 --> 01:18:03.108
Hmm, well, you've got me between
a rock and a hard place, Sir.

01:18:04.076 --> 01:18:05.143
That's the idea.

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:10.315
Hmm, sounds like we have a draw.

01:18:24.196 --> 01:18:27.032
Got you, you piece of shit!

01:18:33.205 --> 01:18:37.042
[Eden] Okay, stranger,
first things first.

01:18:39.211 --> 01:18:40.712
Ah!

01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:02.534
[Tommy whimpering]

01:19:10.843 --> 01:19:12.611
Who the hell are you?

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:26.761
