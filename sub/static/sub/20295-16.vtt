"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.133 --> 00:36.200
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.767
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.800 --> 00:42.000
in a court of law.

00:42.033 --> 00:44.833
-I was born and raised on
the island of Oahu.

00:44.867 --> 00:46.067
Grew up in Pearl City.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.067
I moved to Washington
about 12 years ago.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.167
Got hired on with the Pierce
County Sheriff's Department.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.967
I've been on graveyard for
the last eight years.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.733
I like being proactive at night.

00:53.767 --> 00:57.133
Good night for me is, you know,
trying to catch a bad guy,

00:57.167 --> 00:58.900
then going home to my
wife and kids.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.800
-(on radio)
Six-foot, thin build,
black do-rag, black jacket.

01:01.833 --> 01:05.067
With him was a black female,
long striped dress.

01:05.067 --> 01:07.900
-So we're going to a disturbance
with a knife.

01:07.933 --> 01:09.967
And the guy's supposed to be
running westbound right now,

01:10.067 --> 01:11.433
so we'll see if we
can find him.

01:11.467 --> 01:12.967
Black male, black female.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.767
We're heading east right now,
they should be coming
towards us.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.633
So they should be right
around here somewhere.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.933
What's your name?
-Niki.

01:22.967 --> 01:24.300
-Niki?
-Niki or Kiki, yeah.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.700
-You have your ID?
-No, sir.

01:25.733 --> 01:27.067
-You don't have any ID?

01:27.067 --> 01:29.067
-No, you can check everything,
I don't.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.967
-I got a--
-You got a warrant, yeah?

01:31.067 --> 01:32.100
-Hmm?
-You got warrants?

01:32.133 --> 01:33.833
-I'm not sure.
I just served time in jail.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.467
-What's your legal first name?
-Chrissy.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.600
-Take your backpack off.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.267
-Why am I in trouble?

01:38.300 --> 01:41.967
-Because you guys are being
not too friendly to some
people up the street.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.933
Take this off.
-I don't...

01:43.967 --> 01:46.533
I've been for the last two
and half weeks taking care
of this--

01:46.567 --> 01:48.300
I got-- This is
the proof I need.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.733
-Okay. That's fine.
-Just let him have it.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.500
-I take care of that man,
and for the last two weeks,

01:51.533 --> 01:53.167
I've been trying to find
him mental help,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.667
and I've been cleaning
his house for him.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.767
-Calm down.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.067
-And that lady keeps--

01:57.067 --> 01:59.333
-The victim was knocked out.
Somebody else called 911.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.067
So, tell me what happened then.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.133
-He started talking something
about, "You don't (bleep)
belong here."

02:03.167 --> 02:06.767
Talking about Uni, which is
the tall guy that they're
looking for.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.333
He said that
"You don't (bleep) belong here,"

02:09.367 --> 02:11.333
and when he said that,

02:11.367 --> 02:13.767
the guy was like...
He was like--

02:13.800 --> 02:15.667
No, Uni walks up to him
and says "You don't--"

02:15.700 --> 02:17.867
He's like, "Calm down, sir.
I don't wanna start
problems with you."

02:17.900 --> 02:19.500
And that's when the dude,
like, chest bumped him.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.233
He's like, "Well, you--"
I don't know what he said,

02:21.267 --> 02:23.567
but like, I was trying to break
it up. At that point I was like,

02:23.600 --> 02:25.333
"You guys, like,
come on, you guys."

02:25.367 --> 02:27.800
Like, it's on-- I got it
on recording, like, literally
on my phone right now.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.700
-Okay. So, who is Uni?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.900
-He's... my dude.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.800
-He's your dude?
-Yeah, his name's Calvin.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.967
-Okay. Now, did he just
break north

02:37.067 --> 02:39.133
when I came up behind you?
-He went that way.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.700
-To the right.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.733
-Like, I don't know this
vicinity. I don't know exactly
which way.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
-He go up that street, or what?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.067
-He hit the dark, and as soon
as I looked up, he was gone.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.200
That's the only reason I know.
-Okay.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.100
Got a probable cause
for assault.

02:50.133 --> 02:52.400
Suspect apparently knocked out
the guy he was arguing with,

02:52.433 --> 02:55.300
so right now we're using the K9
to track the suspect

02:55.333 --> 02:57.133
because he fled on foot.

02:57.167 --> 03:00.800
Apparently there was a knife
mentioned in the original--
why we were dispatched here.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.933
-(dog barking)
-That's gonna be him.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.333
-There we go.

03:08.667 --> 03:09.867
-Did he hit on that bag?

03:09.900 --> 03:11.267
-Yeah, he hit the bag.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.267
-Okay. On side, in here?

03:13.300 --> 03:14.967
-Past this mailbox.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.633
-Yup.
-(barking continues)

03:16.667 --> 03:18.100
-Just going nuts.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.667
-He's very interested here.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.167
He kept looking up and
jumping on the trailer.
I saw that too, yeah.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.333
(knocking)

03:23.367 --> 03:25.167
-We got that
permission to go inside.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.800
-So, nobody's supposed
to be in here?
-Nope.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.567
-Apparently there was a knife
involved. See if we can
find anything.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.533
-This is the police!
We have a police dog.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.867
Anybody inside this trailer
needs to come out
or you're gonna get bit.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.900
-(dog barks)
-(knocking)

03:36.933 --> 03:39.667
-Last chance. Come out
or you're gonna get bit.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.833
Take that guy!
Let me see your hands!

03:46.867 --> 03:48.467
-Let me see your hands!

03:48.500 --> 03:50.200
-(man shrieking)
-Let me see your hands!

03:50.233 --> 03:51.800
-Get on the ground!

03:51.833 --> 03:53.833
-Stop fighting!
Get on the ground!

03:53.867 --> 03:57.133
(shouting and yelling)

03:57.167 --> 03:58.600
-Get on the ground!

03:58.633 --> 04:00.167
-Stop fighting!
-Atta boy!

04:00.200 --> 04:01.267
-There you go.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.133
-Give me your hands!
-Got it!

04:03.167 --> 04:06.333
-(barking)
-Get on your stomach!

04:06.367 --> 04:08.400
Get on your stomach!
Give me your hands!

04:11.867 --> 04:13.133
-Relax.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.800
-One, two, three, up!

04:14.833 --> 04:16.267
Come up.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.300
-You keep fighting like that--
-I'm not fighting
anything, sir.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.600
-When we tell you to come out,
you need to come out, man.

04:20.633 --> 04:22.433
-I was trying to,
but the dog was biting me!

04:22.467 --> 04:23.700
-You need to come out.

04:23.733 --> 04:26.133
-You wanna grab his bag.
-I'll get his stuff, yeah.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.867
Good job, man.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.300
He was hitting it
on the outside.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.733
-Yeah.
-Exactly the spot.

04:30.767 --> 04:34.367
-Just enough of a crack for
the scent to filter out.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.300
Good job, boy.
-Good job. Good boy.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.567
So, tell me what happened.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.133
-All I did was go over
there and I helped him.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.467
I helped him clean.
I helped my woman clean
the house and everything.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
-Okay.
-And then the neighbors,

04:44.533 --> 04:46.167
they always harass over there.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.200
-Okay.
-Now he's a mentally ill person.

04:49.233 --> 04:52.067
So the only thing I ever did
was just check on him.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.100
You know what I'm saying?
And come over there
and check on him.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.200
Well, today, the guy
in the back part,

04:56.233 --> 04:59.067
he was being a bit aggressive,
saying "(bleep) you,"
this and this and that.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.867
"Get off the property
or we're calling the police."

05:00.900 --> 05:03.267
Well, you can call the police,
but I'm not doing anything
but helping.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.600
-Right.
-And he's like,

05:04.633 --> 05:06.633
"What, trying to be hard?"
And his shoulder pumped me

05:06.667 --> 05:08.500
and he hit me in my chin,
so I hit him back.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.167
So basically all it was
was self-defense.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.333
I didn't do nothing wrong.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.167
-So when he shoulder bumped you,

05:13.200 --> 05:14.833
where'd he hit you when
he shoulder bumped you?

05:14.867 --> 05:16.667
-It was on my neck
and my face area right here.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.933
-Your left side,
or right side?

05:17.967 --> 05:19.267
-Like this.
-Okay. Okay.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.600
-I'm sorry, I apologize.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.300
-Okay, and after he did that,
that's when you hit him?

05:22.333 --> 05:23.633
You knocked him out?
-I hit him back.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.233
-Knocking him unconscious
from what I hear.

05:25.267 --> 05:26.800
-He got-- He didn't even
really fall.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.100
He fell against the car
and he got back up and he was
looking at us.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.567
-Okay. So, after that--

05:30.600 --> 05:31.933
-I didn't hit him hard at all.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.867
-So, obviously after that you
and your girlfriend left, right?

05:33.900 --> 05:36.233
-I didn't even hit him back
like that, though. It's called
self-defense.

05:36.267 --> 05:37.733
-Okay. So why'd you run?
-I don't know.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.333
-But you breaking
into this trailer,

05:39.367 --> 05:40.433
that's actually
burglary, right?

05:40.467 --> 05:41.967
-But I didn't break in, though.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.067
The door was open.
-You entered a dwelling
that's not yours, though.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.067
-It was open. I was doing it
to just get away, man.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.333
-Hey, you know what, we'll let
the prosecutor figure this out.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.700
-But I'm saying,
but really though,

05:51.733 --> 05:53.400
I just did it to get away.
-Fair enough, man.

05:53.433 --> 05:55.167
-Give me a second.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.367
So right now we're looking
through the bag, see if we can
locate some other stuff.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.167
Just paraphernalia.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.067
Couple pipes they use for drugs.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.833
Probably meth, crack.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.467
Whatever the drug
of their choice is.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.667
Was this knife on him
or was it in the bag?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.467
I think this was on him.

06:09.500 --> 06:14.967
And then just a lot of
deodorants and coloring stuff
and tools and...

06:15.067 --> 06:16.967
Heard that he has five warrants.

06:17.067 --> 06:20.233
So, looks like he's
a career criminal, man.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.633
Hey, Calvin,
why didn't you come out?

06:22.667 --> 06:24.233
-What's there to come
back out for?

06:24.267 --> 06:25.433
Why would I come
back out for?

06:25.467 --> 06:27.167
-Well, you know we were
running around.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.767
-I said I'm not doing anything,
I'm not gonna resist

06:29.800 --> 06:31.267
or anything, and y'all
sent the dog in at me.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.633
I was saying that to you guys.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.700
-If you're saying you did
nothing wrong, right?

06:35.733 --> 06:37.433
-Self-defense.
-It was self-defense, okay.

06:37.467 --> 06:40.067
-He shoved me in my face.
-Can I finish talking?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.733
-Y'all talking to me
like I'm bad or something.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.133
-I'm not saying you're bad.
I'm just trying to figure
stuff out here.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.867
-I'm not no drug addict.
I don't even look like one.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.633
-What I'm saying is,
if you didn't do anything wrong,

06:47.667 --> 06:49.167
and you're
claiming self-defense,

06:49.200 --> 06:50.967
and you see us out here
with the dog,

06:51.067 --> 06:53.633
why not come out and say,
"Hey, you're probably looking
for me."

06:53.667 --> 06:56.333
Boom, give up. Tell us
your side of the story.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.133
-I understand that.
-You know, and then
go from there.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.767
-Thing is, my daughter's
birthday is tomorrow.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.100
-Yeah.
-And I wasn't trying
to be caught by you guys

07:02.133 --> 07:03.467
with the warrant that I have.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.733
-Okay. So you're getting
charged with Assault II,

07:05.767 --> 07:07.400
the drug paraphernalia,
the pipes,

07:07.433 --> 07:09.667
and then you're getting charged
with burglary for going into
the trailer.

07:10.933 --> 07:13.200
-I picked, you know, working
for the city of Hazelton

07:13.233 --> 07:15.267
because for a mid-size city
in Pennsylvania,

07:15.300 --> 07:17.433
we can be busy and you handle
a lot of incidents.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.900
As a result, you know, you gotta
wear a lot of different hats.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.267
Because, you know, you're
the first responder, you're it.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.367
And as a result, I've gotten
a lot of great experience
working here,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.333
and if you want to be passionate
about doing police work,

07:27.367 --> 07:29.600
this is the place to do it.

07:29.633 --> 07:33.233
We got a report of an individual
barricaded inside an apartment.

07:33.267 --> 07:35.733
He threatened to shoot
the caller,

07:35.767 --> 07:39.767
and he also threatened to shoot
anybody who goes inside
the apartment.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.133
10-4, I'm in the area.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.933
-(on radio)
21-23, be advised,

07:46.967 --> 07:50.433
your caller is gonna be in
the parking lot in the back
of that location.

07:50.467 --> 07:52.100
-Did you call?
-I called.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.533
I'm the father.
-What's going on?

07:53.567 --> 07:54.967
-He's fighting with
his girlfriend.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.900
He said "Come up here." I said,
"Listen, it's your father.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.600
"Hold on, give me a second.
Let me talk to the girl,
see what's going on."

07:59.633 --> 08:02.400
And he locked himself in and say
"Anybody come up here--"

08:02.433 --> 08:04.133
Knock on the front door,
he don't wanna open.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.567
He say, "I got your gun."
I gotta gun under my pillow.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.200
I got two more
guns in the closet.

08:08.233 --> 08:09.467
-You do, so now he has
access to them.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.967
What about the other gun?

08:11.067 --> 08:13.067
-The other one under
my pillow is loaded.
-Okay.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.867
-It don't have no safety.
-What kind of gun is that?

08:14.900 --> 08:16.333
-Uh, a .40.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.500
-Okay, so he said if you come in
the house, he's gonna shoot you?

08:18.533 --> 08:20.300
-He said he's gonna shoot
anybody that comes--

08:20.333 --> 08:21.600
that tries to come
through the house.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.833
He just be talking to me
right here through the window.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.667
And the operator
from the police told me

08:26.700 --> 08:28.167
do not go inside the house.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.933
-Through this window here?
-Yeah, this is my room.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.433
-Where's the super
for the building?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.067
-Right there,
but nobody got a key.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.867
-Jason!

08:34.900 --> 08:37.333
-That's not gonna work.

08:37.367 --> 08:41.067
-How about we put that in there
and wedge it to make it
big enough to--

08:41.100 --> 08:43.067
-Yeah, that's-- There we go.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.500
-Putty knife.

08:45.833 --> 08:46.833
-There we go.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.100
-Okay, get ready. Get ready.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.600
-Jason!
-Let's open it up.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.400
-The city police,
we're coming in!

08:52.433 --> 08:54.400
-Got a chair at the door.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.067
Hang on, give me a second.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.233
-Put your hand in
and then push it.

08:58.267 --> 09:01.133
-Jason, let me see your hands!

09:01.167 --> 09:02.400
-Where you at?

09:02.433 --> 09:03.900
Hazelton Police, Jason!

09:03.933 --> 09:05.567
Just come out
with your hands up!

09:05.600 --> 09:06.633
-Where is he?

09:06.667 --> 09:08.367
-Jason!

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
This room's clear.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.500
Jason!

09:14.933 --> 09:17.667
-He got-- maybe he
bailed out the window.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.067
-Clear?

09:21.067 --> 09:22.233
-So far.

09:22.267 --> 09:24.567
-Coming out! Open it up!

09:24.600 --> 09:25.967
-Nope.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.433
Yup, left the scene.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.133
-Okay, why don't you
have this one.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.500
-What's up?
-One of my guns here.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.433
-All right. Let me take
a look at that. Thanks.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.700
This is the one,
where's the safe?

09:36.733 --> 09:39.067
I saw a long gun
in there, I'm pretty sure.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.233
-Get out!
-Let me see your hands!

09:41.267 --> 09:43.467
-Let me see your hands!
-Get out!

09:43.500 --> 09:45.600
-Get out!
-I'll get out,
just don't hurt me, please.

09:45.633 --> 09:46.933
-Get out, now!

09:46.967 --> 09:48.733
-You got two seconds, get out
or I'm dragging you.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.467
-Get up!
-Please, stop.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.433
-Stop dragging me!
-Get on your stomach!

09:52.467 --> 09:54.100
-Get on the ground!
-Stop!

09:54.133 --> 09:55.500
-Get on the ground!
-Stop!

09:55.533 --> 09:57.100
Get on the ground!
-(shouting)

09:57.133 --> 09:59.400
-Get on your stomach
or we're gonna tase you!

09:59.433 --> 10:01.433
-I got his hand,
get the other hand!

10:01.467 --> 10:02.933
-I was gonna come out, guys!

10:02.967 --> 10:04.400
-Oh, right, right, right.
-No, I was!

10:04.433 --> 10:06.633
-While we're looking for you.
-I was just scared.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.233
I was just scared, that's all.

10:08.267 --> 10:09.833
-What are you scared
of the police for, man?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.433
-Because...
-All you had to do is
come out with your hands up.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.833
...locking myself in!

10:13.867 --> 10:16.433
I'm asking you guys nicely,
stop throwing me, I'll get up.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.000
Please, just help me up.
Just help me up.

10:18.033 --> 10:20.033
Just help me up.
Help me up, please.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.567
(grunting)

10:21.600 --> 10:24.900
-Woman: So, Jason,
why the hell did you go off--
-One in the chamber.

10:24.933 --> 10:27.100
-Because if he would have just
talked to me when he had
the chance,

10:27.133 --> 10:28.533
none of this
would have happened.

10:28.567 --> 10:31.400
-I'm sorry about
getting you guys--
-I was calling you--

10:31.433 --> 10:32.900
-I'm not gonna be
disrespectful to you guys--

10:32.933 --> 10:34.267
-All right, all right,
you gotta get out!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.567
Just go outside for now
till we straighten this out.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.700
-Can I just tell you guys
sorry, please, face-to-face?

10:39.733 --> 10:41.133
No, I'm talking
about to the cops.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.567
-Okay, we're gonna take you
out front and square this out.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.300
-I wanna talk to
you cops out front.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.767
-Lieutenant, we're going out
the front door.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.100
-Okay!
-That was a first.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.333
-Underneath the sink.

10:49.367 --> 10:52.233
I popped the door open,
he was in there.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.400
-Whew.
-Dang.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.967
-How many guns are in here?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.600
-I saw a long gun
in the closet.

10:57.633 --> 10:58.900
-Here's his glasses.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.700
-What do you got?

11:01.733 --> 11:05.067
-I got an M&P Shield.
Looks like a .40.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.133
1-7-9, County.
I have a 10-80 to run.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.233
It's gonna be
a Smith & Wesson .40 cal.

11:19.433 --> 11:20.600
-(on radio)
Copy, stand by.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.900
-Perfect.

11:25.233 --> 11:27.100
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on, all right?

11:27.133 --> 11:28.467
You had everybody scared.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.700
-I just wanted my dad to come
upstairs alone and talk with me.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.500
-So you-- So why--
-That's all I wanted.

11:32.533 --> 11:36.067
-But did you or did you not tell
him that you were gonna shoot
anybody who came inside?

11:36.100 --> 11:37.500
-No, I didn't!

11:37.533 --> 11:38.833
-You sure?
-Where's the proof?

11:38.867 --> 11:40.167
-I just want to know
what happened.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.867
-I just got into a little fight.
Got into a little letback.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.067
Again, they cut me off of
my mental medications

11:45.067 --> 11:46.433
for almost three months now

11:46.467 --> 11:48.367
because I got stopped--
-What are you diagnosed with?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.100
-I have schizophrenia,
and bipolar I, and psychosis.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.267
-We wouldn't be here if your
dad didn't care about you.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.733
-I know, I know.
I understand that.
-Okay.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.633
-And I love him,
and I understand
what he's doing for me.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.300
Please tell him
that I love him.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.067
Please tell him that
I appreciate him, all right?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.733
I didn't mean any of this--
-We'll figure it out.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.067
I just want you to sit down.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.567
I want you to take
a few deep breaths.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.233
-Can I please get
a drink of water or something?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.400
I'm thirsty.
-In a little bit, okay?
We'll get that.

12:08.433 --> 12:10.533
-But honestly, Officers,
all of you guys...

12:10.567 --> 12:12.567
-You want to talk
to a counselor?
-I want to apologize

12:12.600 --> 12:14.067
to all of you
personally, all right?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.533
-You want to go up and
talk to a counselor?

12:15.567 --> 12:17.633
-What I really want is
just something to drink,

12:17.667 --> 12:19.433
something to eat, and a bed.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.700
That's all I really want.
-I can get you all that
at the hospital.

12:21.733 --> 12:22.967
-You can? Please.
-Yeah.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.233
-I'll appreciate it.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.900
You want to go up
and talk to a counselor?
-Yes.

12:25.933 --> 12:28.100
I'll do it. Just, if you guys--

12:28.133 --> 12:29.967
If I'll get your guys' respect,

12:30.067 --> 12:32.133
in the future, if you ever see
me in the street,

12:32.167 --> 12:33.733
if I can just wave
hi at you--

12:33.767 --> 12:35.767
-The way to get my respect is
when I'm knocking on that door,

12:35.800 --> 12:37.967
you say "Hey, I'm coming out."
-Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.367
I'm very sorry.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.933
I should have said
I was coming out.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.467
But I got scared, all right?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.533
It was just
a natural instinct.
-And that's all you had to say,

12:44.567 --> 12:46.200
"I'm scared,
I'm opening the door."

12:46.233 --> 12:47.933
-I wanted to.
I really wanted to,

12:47.967 --> 12:50.167
but I got really scared.
All right? I'm sorry.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.067
-Just sit tight, we'll get you
up to the hospital.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.067
-Sorry. Does my dad want
to talk to me real quickly?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.433
-Hey, you want to talk
to him real quick?

12:55.467 --> 12:56.800
-Here. These are
his cell phones.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.333
I'm gonna give them
to you, okay?

12:58.367 --> 13:00.767
Okay? That's what
you said. Give your dad
the cell phones, right?

13:00.800 --> 13:03.233
-Yup, exactly what I said.
Give him the cell phones.
-He's got 'em.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.433
You're gonna meet him
at the hospital, right?
-Again, listen to me!

13:05.467 --> 13:06.633
I apologize.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.100
I'm sorry. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.867
I know I'm gonna go back
to First House where I know
I need the help.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.200
Thank you, guys.
Everyone here, thank you.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.833
But, honestly, please, don't
look at me any different

13:16.867 --> 13:18.900
when I come out of the hospital
when you see me in the street.

13:18.933 --> 13:20.500
Please don't look at me
any different.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.533
-Okay.
-'Cause I'm thanking you guys
all right now for helping me.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.700
-All right, well, let's get you
to the hospital, okay?
-All right.

13:24.733 --> 13:25.867
-Let's get going here.
-Let's go.

13:25.900 --> 13:26.967
-All right.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.600
-I used to be in sales,

13:31.633 --> 13:33.800
and I just got to a point where
I wasn't enjoying it.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.633
I wanted something
more exciting,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.867
something that was
different every day.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.100
A lot of the aspects of police
work I really enjoy,

13:41.133 --> 13:42.833
really piqued my interest in it,

13:42.867 --> 13:46.367
and decided to pursue it,
and here I am.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.567
Okay, I was behind
this vehicle and turned,

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
and failed to use
his turn signal.

13:50.633 --> 13:53.333
So we're gonna pull it over
and see what's going on.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.867
(siren blares)

14:10.300 --> 14:11.433
How's it going?

14:11.467 --> 14:12.633
-All right. How you doing?
-Good.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.400
Let me see your hands. Okay.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.767
I'm Officer Clark,
Lubbock Police Department.
Reason you're being stopped is

14:16.800 --> 14:19.067
when you turned back there
off of, I believe it's
First Street...

14:19.067 --> 14:20.633
-Yes, sir.
-...you failed to use
your turn signal.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.633
-Oh, okay.
-Any reason for the violation?

14:22.667 --> 14:24.567
-Uh, no, sir.
I was just leaving the store.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.233
-Okay. You have your license
and insurance on you?

14:26.267 --> 14:27.833
-Uh...

14:35.267 --> 14:36.800
-Is this just an ID card?
-Yes, sir.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.367
-You don't have
a driver's license?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.567
-No, sir.
-Oh, okay.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.067
You been smoking
something in here?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.600
-No.
-Do you smoke synthetic?

14:42.633 --> 14:43.767
-No, hell no.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.433
-That's what it smells like.
-No, hell no.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.667
I don't smoke that
crazy (bleep).

14:46.700 --> 14:48.067
-That stuff is crazy.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.133
-Nah, hell no.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.867
-What am I
catching a whiff of?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.367
Do you smoke tobacco?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.733
-Uh, cigarettes.
-Cigarettes.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.833
-Nah, I don't smoke...

14:54.867 --> 14:56.367
-You don't smoke
anything else?
-No, sir.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.067
-All right. Do me a favor
and just step out.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.100
Put your hands right up here.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.367
You got anything on you?
-Huh?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.500
-Got anything on you?
-No, sir.

15:04.533 --> 15:06.167
-Can I check your pockets?
-Oh, yeah.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.067
-Just your cash.
-Yeah.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.167
-How much cash you got here?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.233
-Little bit over $300.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.833
-Where do you work?
-(indistinct)

15:13.867 --> 15:16.167
-All right, do me a favor and
just walk right back over here.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.867
Just right here. Right here.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.200
Just...

15:21.433 --> 15:24.700
Um... anything in the car?

15:24.733 --> 15:25.933
-Huh?
-Anything in the car?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.067
Illegal?
-No, sir.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.100
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.400
-Okay. You mind
if I search it?

15:29.433 --> 15:31.333
-Uh, I would like for you
to have a search warrant.

15:31.367 --> 15:32.733
-A search warrant.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.500
Okay, you're not giving me
consent to search it?
-No, sir.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.633
-Okay.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.067
But there's nothing in
the vehicle, right?

15:39.067 --> 15:40.300
-No, sir.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.100
-So what's the problem
with me searching it?

15:42.133 --> 15:45.333
-I just-- It's my wife's,
know what I mean.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.067
-Okay.

15:49.167 --> 15:50.567
Are you West Texas?

15:50.600 --> 15:51.733
-Huh?
-A gang member?

15:51.767 --> 15:53.133
-Uh, I was.
-You were.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.867
-Yeah. No, years ago.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.700
I mean, I went
to prison in '06.

15:56.733 --> 15:59.400
-Okay.
21-22, is K9 available?

15:59.433 --> 16:01.533
-(on radio) 10-4.
-Don't do nothing
since you got out?

16:01.567 --> 16:02.900
-No, I'm a family man.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.800
-Okay. How many kids you got?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.300
-Six.
-Six kids?!

16:06.333 --> 16:08.067
-(chuckles) Yeah.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.300
-Man.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.533
So you're a pretty busy guy.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.467
Wow.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.133
Okay, this is
a K9 officer, okay?

16:16.167 --> 16:17.933
He's gonna run
his dog around it.

16:17.967 --> 16:20.433
If he hits on anything, it's
gonna give us probable cause
to search the vehicle.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.500
Is there anything
in that vehicle?

16:22.533 --> 16:23.767
-Not that I know of.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.333
-Not that you know of.
-Yeah.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.400
-So if there is
something in there,
you just weren't aware of it.

16:27.433 --> 16:28.500
-Right.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.933
-Okay, who all
uses this vehicle?

16:30.967 --> 16:35.067
-Uh, me, my-- Really just
me, my wife, and my cousins.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.233
-Okay. Does your
wife use drugs?

16:37.267 --> 16:38.467
-No.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.767
-Uh, and your cousins?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.567
Use the vehicle?
-Well, weed.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.300
-They smoke weed?
-Yeah.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.867
-So there may be
some weed in the car?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.233
-No. No, there ain't
no weed in the car.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.900
-There ain't no weed
in the car.
-No. No weed.

16:48.933 --> 16:51.633
-Okay. Do you have insurance
papers on this vehicle?

16:51.667 --> 16:54.067
-No. It had insurance,
but we took it off.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.233
-Okay.

16:55.267 --> 16:56.933
-(dog whining)

16:56.967 --> 16:58.333
-Positive alert.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.767
We're good. We can
search the whole car.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.433
-So, I guess the dog hit.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.167
Come over here for me.
You're not under arrest
at this moment, okay?

17:04.200 --> 17:07.400
Just gonna be detained further.
So just have a seat.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.400
Gonna search this vehicle,
see if there's anything in it.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.533
-Ah, pistol.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.067
-Pistol.

17:18.067 --> 17:20.633
-And guess what--
guess what he is.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.067
Registered gang member.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.333
-Fantastic.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.433
Is it loaded?

17:25.467 --> 17:26.833
One in the clip,
one in the chamber?

17:26.867 --> 17:28.333
-Nope.
-No. Okay.

17:28.367 --> 17:29.967
-That's a nice gun.
-Where was that?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.500
-It was right in between here.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.867
-Right in there.
-Ah, here we go.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.467
Right here.
Looked like a meth pipe.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.567
Yup. See if we got anything
else, but...

17:36.600 --> 17:39.067
you for sure got him for that.
Oh, here's your grinder.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.400
-That's a fancy-looking grinder.

17:40.433 --> 17:41.967
-Looks like it got some
weed residue in it.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.233
-Some paraphernalia.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.833
Let me see
that firearm, Dalton.

17:45.867 --> 17:48.933
It is a SIG Sauer P229.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.867
21-22, I need
to check a firearm.

17:51.900 --> 17:56.233
Serial number: Lima, 3-7-8-8.

17:56.267 --> 17:57.733
He's a registered gang member,

17:57.767 --> 18:01.800
so he is not allowed to be
in possession of a firearm.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.233
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

18:04.267 --> 18:06.900
-Oh, fantastic!

18:06.933 --> 18:08.333
Good job, Mark.

18:08.367 --> 18:09.400
-Where'd you find that?

18:09.433 --> 18:11.700
-This was right here.

18:11.733 --> 18:12.933
-Atta boy.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.567
Now we know why he
didn't want you to search.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.133
-That-- it looks
like methamphetamines.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.733
-Dang, that's a lot.

18:18.767 --> 18:20.433
-(on radio)
5-2-6, 5-22-66.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.200
-Oh, his gun's gonna be stolen.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.900
-That was a productive stop.

18:23.933 --> 18:26.933
-So he's gonna be in possession
of a stolen firearm
and methamphetamines.

18:28.700 --> 18:32.300
All right. Um, since we
located that stuff in the car,

18:32.333 --> 18:34.067
we are gonna seize the car,

18:34.100 --> 18:36.233
and we're gonna seize
that cash, okay?

18:36.267 --> 18:39.067
Um, so again,

18:39.067 --> 18:40.900
we found a stolen gun in there,

18:40.933 --> 18:44.833
and then we also found
a large bag of methamphetamines.

18:44.867 --> 18:47.367
I heard you say
that we found it.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
So you knew it was
in the car, right?
-Yeah.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.933
-Okay. Are you selling?

18:50.967 --> 18:52.933
-No. That's just me.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.167
-So that was all
for personal use?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.533
-Yeah.
-Really?

18:56.567 --> 18:58.367
Um, did you know
the gun was stolen?

18:58.400 --> 18:59.500
-Nah, man, I didn't know.

18:59.533 --> 19:01.167
-Where'd you get
that gun from?

19:01.200 --> 19:04.567
-Just-- I got it off
one of my friends, but...

19:04.600 --> 19:05.800
I didn't know it was stolen.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.067
-Did you just
buy it from him?
-Yeah.

19:07.067 --> 19:08.200
-How much did you pay for it?

19:08.233 --> 19:09.767
Couple hundred bucks?
-Yeah.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.567
-Okay, you know what that gun
probably retails for?

19:12.600 --> 19:15.733
That's a $1,000 gun, at least.
1,200 bucks.

19:15.767 --> 19:18.400
And if you're buying a gun like
that for a couple hundred bucks,

19:18.433 --> 19:19.867
there's a reason why
that gun's cheap.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.500
Because it's stolen.

19:21.533 --> 19:24.200
If it's a deal that
sounds too good to be true,
it probably is, right?

19:24.233 --> 19:25.400
-Right.
-Okay.

19:25.433 --> 19:28.700
How much did you spend
on all that meth?

19:30.267 --> 19:31.533
-About 600.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.067
-600?

19:33.067 --> 19:35.400
Is this maybe gonna
change from here on out?

19:35.433 --> 19:37.433
Think your kids could have
used that $600?

19:37.467 --> 19:38.933
-Yeah.
-All right, man.

19:38.967 --> 19:41.533
So, you're gonna
be charged with possession
of the stolen firearm,

19:41.567 --> 19:43.100
possession of
the controlled substance,

19:43.133 --> 19:45.100
and then UCW, unlawful
carrying of a weapon,

19:45.133 --> 19:48.300
for being a registered gang
member in possession
of a firearm.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.767
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.733
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.767 --> 19:54.900
Cover is code three.

19:54.933 --> 19:57.900
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.533 --> 20:05.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:05.533 --> 20:06.700
-(theme music playing)
