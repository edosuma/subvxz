00:20.440 --> 00:22.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.640
- How you doin'?
- Good.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.840
- Did you get your hair cut?
- Yeah. Why?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.920
No reason.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.360
- Can I see your scar?
- No.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.840
Fraiser says it'll be about a week
before you get outta here.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.040
It's funny, after all we've been through
these past few years,...

00:47.200 --> 00:50.440
..and of all things
it's my appendix that lays me out.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.360
But it's not gonna be a week.
I mean, I'm practically... I feel fine now.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.200
Wanna go fishin'?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.720
Actually, I wouldn't, uh...

01:02.840 --> 01:04.760
Well, maybe...

01:04.920 --> 01:09.400
You know, I think maybe I will
just stay here for two or three days.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.120
Bye.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.680
Carter!

01:25.480 --> 01:27.240
Sir. Hi.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.080
- How's Daniel?
- Oh, he's gonna be fine.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.000
What are you doin'?

01:34.160 --> 01:38.880
I'm getting ready to analyse the decay
rate of naqahdah within the reactor.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.120
It's really amazing.
Unlike plutonium, naqahdah has...

01:42.280 --> 01:44.040
Agh!

01:44.880 --> 01:47.760
- I'm on vacation.
- Yes, sir.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.840
- So are you.
- I know.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.480
It's not that I'm happy that
Daniel's in excruciating pain,...

01:55.640 --> 01:59.320
..but I've been looking forward to
an opportunity like this for some time.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.240
Maybe it's just me, but I always thought
when one got some leave,...

02:03.400 --> 02:05.320
..one actually left.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.560
Daniel's recuping,
Teal'c's off visiting his kids somewhere.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Personally I have a date with a lake in
Minnesota where the bass grow that big.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.400
Really?

02:20.560 --> 02:22.480
Oh, yes!

02:23.400 --> 02:27.560
What I am describing here, Carter,
involves a very special element.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.760
This is fun to me, sir.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.360
Well, if playing with your reactor
sounds better than exploring the lakes...

02:38.520 --> 02:43.440
..and natural beauty of northern
Minnesota, there's not much I can do.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.880
Was that an invitation, sir?

02:46.040 --> 02:49.840
Nothing wrong with that,
is there? Couple of co-workers,...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.320
..friends, if you will, fishing.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.320
It'd be fun.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.120
Wow. I appreciate the offer, sir, really.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.200
It... sounds great.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.520
- But I should...
- No sweat.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.440
See you in a week. And by all means,...

03:09.840 --> 03:11.760
..have fun.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.480
Colonel.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.040
Uh...

03:28.760 --> 03:30.720
Have a good time.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.600
Land of sky-blue waters, loofahs,...

03:33.760 --> 03:36.680
..yah sure,
you betcha, snookums. Mosquitoes...

03:39.720 --> 03:40.440
(alarm)

03:43.840 --> 03:45.760
Home of the loon...

04:03.320 --> 04:05.240
Thor?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.280
Hello?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.560
(whirring)

04:35.040 --> 04:36.960
What the hell...?

04:42.280 --> 04:43.800
Damn.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.480
I'm pretty sure it was
the Asgard transportation technology.

06:24.640 --> 06:29.600
- For Jack's sake, let's hope you're right.
- Depends what they want this time, sir.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.680
True.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.040
Send a message
through the Stargate to Teal'c.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.760
This is General Hammond.
Get me Major Davis at the Pentagon.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.880
- Thor?
- Greetings, O'Neill.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.960
Turn right, then enter the door
at the end ofthe corridor.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.160
- O'Neill.
- Thor!

07:33.080 --> 07:35.880
- You all right?
- I am dying.

07:37.120 --> 07:42.920
- What happened?
- It is, as you humans say, a long story.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.200
This have anything to do
with those... bugs in the hall?

07:47.480 --> 07:50.840
I could not transport you
directly into this room.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.200
The... bugs, as you call them,...

07:55.360 --> 07:59.360
..are attracted to
the high-energy output of the transporter.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.720
- What are they?
- They are the enemy of the Asgard.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.360
This would be the enemy worse
than the Goa'uld you told me about?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.680
I am weak.

08:10.840 --> 08:16.480
The information you will need
is contained within the stones.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.640
- Forgive me.
- For what?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.400
Thor?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.360
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.720
I have made these recordings
for you in the event that I am dead...

08:59.880 --> 09:03.320
..or unable to pass on
the necessary information.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.600
Under my command,
the Biliskner was called into battle...

09:07.760 --> 09:11.120
..against an enemy
we have named "replicators".

09:12.040 --> 09:16.680
During the battle, this ship
became infested by the technology.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.040
The replicators accessed the computer,...

09:21.240 --> 09:26.240
..which contained information about
your planet, and plotted a course here.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.000
The crew was transported offthe ship.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.760
I destroyed the outbound
transporter technology...

09:31.920 --> 09:35.040
..to prevent the replicators
from escaping...

09:35.200 --> 09:39.920
..and remained, in the hopes ofstopping
the Biliskner from reaching Earth.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.760
If you are watching this recording,
then I have failed...

09:44.920 --> 09:49.120
..and I have also likely
doomed you to certain death.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.840
Teal'c, thank you for returning.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.160
For what matter of urgency have
I been summoned, General Hammond?

10:03.320 --> 10:08.640
I think I witnessed Colonel O'Neill being
transported out of the base by the Asgard.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.120
- For what purpose?
- We're not sure yet.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.600
Hello? Testing, testing.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.680
Testing! ls this thing on?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.520
- Colonel?
- Carter?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.400
- Sir, what's going on?
- Well...

10:23.560 --> 10:28.040
I need a SPAS-12,
a BF-8, ten pounds ofPBX and a USAS...

10:28.200 --> 10:32.120
..at the base ofthe Stargate in,
oh... five minutes?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.680
- That's a lot of explosive, sir.
- May I ask why?

10:35.840 --> 10:41.240
Yeah, basically Thor's ship has been
overrun by a bunch ofnasty technobugs.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.320
- Were the Asgard unable to defeat them?
- I guess not.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.120
Are you saying
these bugs are technological?

10:47.280 --> 10:51.440
Yeah. Apparently they plan to
land the ship and infest Earth.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.880
Thor says this would not be a good thing.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.280
What are you goin' to do?

10:56.440 --> 10:58.240
Destroy the ship.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.520
- Where's Thor?
- Oh, he's here.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.000
He's just not feeling
too well at the moment.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.520
We'll be ready in ten minutes, sir.
Thor can transport us up to help.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.160
Thank you, Carter,
but that's not gonna happen.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.440
Thor's out cold.
The bugs got him pretty good.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.600
But he did leave instructions
on how to run the toys up here.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.480
- So can you transport us up?
- I could.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.400
But I'm not going to.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.640
What is your reasoning, O'Neill?

11:26.800 --> 11:29.360
Anybody who comes up
is not gettin' down.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.200
- Well, sir, if you can't get off the ship...
- Yeah. I know.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.720
Look, my time's almost up here.
Have the stuffready in ten minutes.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.360
Wish me luck.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.560
- Colonel...
- Major, it's an order and it's final.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.200
Good luck, Jack.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.280
Thank you, sir.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.680
Teal'c, see that the ordnance is in place.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.320
Major, to your knowledge,
if Colonel O'Neill is unsuccessful,...

12:17.480 --> 12:21.200
..can the Asgard ship be destroyed
by a surface-to-air strike?

12:21.360 --> 12:24.360
Sir, the Asgard ships have
sophisticated cloaking devices.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.120
We've been looking for it since
the colonel disappeared. Still nothing.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.640
So if we can't see it, we can't target it.

12:35.440 --> 12:40.280
The molecular transportation device has
been preprogrammed to target the area...

12:40.440 --> 12:44.400
- ..directly in front ofyour Earth Stargate.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.520
(O'Neill fast-forwards)

12:46.680 --> 12:48.600
O'Neill.

12:48.760 --> 12:53.120
Enter these symbols
on the control console in front ofyou.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.880
30 seconds after entering the code,...

12:59.040 --> 13:04.200
..the targeted material will be
transported to the indicated cargo hold.

13:05.720 --> 13:11.400
Remember, the transportation
technology emits an energy pulse...

13:11.560 --> 13:15.360
..strong enough to attract the replicators.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.440
Dammit, I gave you people a direct order!

13:42.600 --> 13:45.720
General Hammond overruled you, sir.
We have a way off the ship.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.560
(bang)

13:47.720 --> 13:50.480
(whirring and scuttling)

13:53.600 --> 13:55.920
Grab what you can. Let's go.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.080
Let's move!

14:54.120 --> 14:56.520
Hey, buddy. How you feelin'?

14:57.800 --> 15:00.120
You remember Carter, Teal'c?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.880
Why did you bring them?

15:04.240 --> 15:07.080
- Anyone?
- We believe we could be of assistance.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.200
Now you will all die.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.400
Actually, we don't think so. Sir, there's
a shuttle prepping on the launch pad.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.440
If we can transmit the coordinates to
NASA, they can be here within hours.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.000
We also brought spacesuits
in case EVA is required.

15:20.160 --> 15:26.080
This pod can generate an antigravity
field, making it easy to move.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.920
- Does this ship have an airlock?
- Yes.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
So we just plant some PBX,
jump ship and blow it.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.520
What is... PBX?

15:37.840 --> 15:41.520
- An explosive.
- Just tell us the best places to plant it.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.560
All Asgard ships are equipped
with internal dampening fields...

15:46.720 --> 15:49.840
..that activate in the event of an explosion.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.720
Well, how exactly did you
expect us to destroy the ship?

15:55.880 --> 15:59.000
If I knew a fast, simple method,...

15:59.680 --> 16:04.280
..l would have destroyed the ship myself
before endangering your lives.

16:05.440 --> 16:10.200
- Of course you would have.
- The technical specifications of the ship...

16:10.360 --> 16:14.360
..were contained within
the recordings I made for you.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.680
Oh, um...

16:16.840 --> 16:19.320
I haven't had time to watch all the stones.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.280
What?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.760
Stick those... on there.

16:30.480 --> 16:36.240
The Biliskner is powered by
four neutrino ion generators.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.400
In Earth units ofmeasurement, each
engine outputs a maximum ofa billion...

16:41.560 --> 16:44.480
Yeah, my eyes glossed over
right about there.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.080
I'd better go through all these recordings.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.600
..is achieved by two rear thrusters.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.880
Welcome back.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.400
I wish it wasn't always
under such unusual circumstances.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.720
- Any further word on the situation?
- No.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.800
We've been unable to make
radio contact with SG-1 .

17:08.960 --> 17:12.839
It's possible the Asgard cloaking device
is also blocking radio signals.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.800
- I see you've done your homework.
- All I do all day long...

17:15.960 --> 17:17.880
..is read up on the Stargate programme.

17:19.480 --> 17:25.280
They were discovered on an isolated
planet in our home galaxy some time ago.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.560
The creators were not present.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.320
Most likely destroyed
by their own creation.

17:31.480 --> 17:37.320
The replicators were brought
aboard an Asgard ship for study...

17:37.480 --> 17:40.320
..before the danger
could be fully comprehended.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.360
We do that all the time.
Kind of expected more from you guys.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.480
Overconfidence in our technology
has been our undoing.

17:49.880 --> 17:54.240
The entities learned from the very means
that were employed to stop them.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.800
They have become
a plague on our galaxy...

17:57.960 --> 18:01.600
..that is annihilating everything in its path.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.000
Why haven't these little
buggers landed the ship?

18:05.160 --> 18:10.600
Their odds of survival in a new
environment depend on numbers.

18:11.600 --> 18:16.040
They are currently feeding off
the ship and replicating.

18:16.200 --> 18:21.160
- Are you saying they're eating the ship?
- Ingesting the alloys, yes.

18:21.320 --> 18:26.440
They will continue until they risk
compromising the integrity of the hull.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.600
Then they will land,
in search of more raw materials.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.680
- How intelligent are they?
- Their capacity for learning is very high.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.320
Each entity is capable
of individual behaviour,...

18:43.160 --> 18:47.960
..yet they all act with a common purpose.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.000
- What's that?
- Self-replication.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.560
- And it appears we cannot stop them.
- Hang on. Thor...

18:55.720 --> 18:59.200
You said they wouldn't risk
compromising the integrity of the hull.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.160
Correct.

19:00.320 --> 19:03.680
Can this ship withstand
an uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry?

19:03.840 --> 19:08.960
No. The heat from the friction
would cause the ship to burn up.

19:09.320 --> 19:14.000
Wait. Are you telling me that with all
this advanced intergalactic technology,...

19:14.160 --> 19:16.320
..this ship can't withstand a little heat?

19:16.480 --> 19:20.200
In order to reflect the subspace
field of the phase generator...

19:20.360 --> 19:22.440
So... no.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.600
Yes.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.400
Then we can just crash the ship
into the atmosphere.

19:28.720 --> 19:34.080
You will have to regain control
of the navigational computer.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.480
Sounds like a plan.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.000
That can only be done from the bridge.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.160
There was a map in the recordings.
Can we direct them from here as they go?

19:46.320 --> 19:48.480
Yes.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.800
OK.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.840
(whirring and scuttling)

20:04.720 --> 20:06.640
(clunk)

20:07.200 --> 20:09.120
Hear that?

20:09.720 --> 20:12.040
They are in the walls, O'Neill.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.280
(Carter) Colonel, can you hear me?

20:15.440 --> 20:17.360
We hear ya.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.760
You wanna go down that hall.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.960
Why are some areas flashing?

20:28.120 --> 20:33.680
They indicate the quadrants of the ship
that the replicators have disabled.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.600
- How do I zoom in?
- Top left symbol.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.760
You wanna go through
that door on your left.

21:33.800 --> 21:38.160
- Why can't I see any bugs on the screen?
- The first thing the replicators do...

21:38.320 --> 21:40.880
..once aboard an Asgard ship...

21:41.000 --> 21:44.640
..is disable the sensors
capable of detecting them.

21:44.800 --> 21:50.160
- But I can still see the colonel and Teal'c.
- They are detected by thermal sensors,...

21:50.320 --> 21:52.600
..which cannot see the replicators.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.320
(gasps)

21:58.120 --> 22:00.040
Are you OK?

22:00.200 --> 22:04.080
I cannot use the ship's
automated medical system.

22:04.240 --> 22:09.000
If the replicators have
tampered with it, it could kill me.

22:09.640 --> 22:13.320
We brought medical supplies
and I have medical field training.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.600
You cannot help me.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.680
(O'Neill) Are we there yet?

22:28.760 --> 22:31.480
The door up ahead on your left
leads to the bridge.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.240
(whirring and scampering)

22:38.800 --> 22:41.920
It sounds as if there are replicators inside.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.760
Watch yourself.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.480
Forget that!

23:14.480 --> 23:16.400
OK, new plan.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.120
- Nothing's been damaged.
- Good.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.200
Sir.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.280
Thor's not doing well.

23:32.440 --> 23:37.200
He says that pod could put him into
a deep stasis that would preserve his life.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.840
- So do it.
- He won't let me.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.360
Hey.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.920
I understand you're not being
a particularly cooperative patient.

23:52.320 --> 23:57.920
As long as I am conscious,
I still may be of some assistance.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.720
Yeah. However, if you're dead...

24:00.880 --> 24:06.640
As I have said,
if you do succeed in destroying the ship,...

24:06.800 --> 24:09.160
..we will all die.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.880
And as Carter has said,
we might have a way off this ship.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.720
Wait a minute. That's it!

24:17.840 --> 24:21.920
You said there are dampening fields
inside the ship that prevent explosions.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.880
- What about outside the ship?
- There are shields around the ship,...

24:26.040 --> 24:31.200
..but they would not protect against
a weapon already inside the force field.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.840
OK, now there was a specific engine
in the information recordings.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.560
- It controls re-entry.
- The deceleration drive. Yes.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.840
Would an explosive enhanced
with elementary naqahdah...

24:43.120 --> 24:45.400
..be enough to destroy
the deceleration drive?

24:45.560 --> 24:47.920
This plan could work.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.360
Plan?

24:51.640 --> 24:52.920
What plan?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.680
The bugs will land the ship
themselves eventually.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.120
The BF-8 might be enough firepower
to blow the deceleration drive.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.440
Might.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.240
If we blow it at the right time,
we alter the entry path.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.480
The ship would accelerate
and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.600
What needs to be done, then, is to place
this explosive outside of this vessel.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.680
Someone's gonna have to go out there.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.760
Of course they are.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.800
What are you doing
down here, Dr Jackson?

25:29.960 --> 25:33.440
I've just been informed, sir.
Is there anything I can do to help?

25:33.600 --> 25:38.320
General, we're going to DEFCON Three.
The Russians have also gone on alert.

25:38.480 --> 25:43.000
If the Asgard ship lands, the president will
tell the rest of the world what we know.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.600
- And then?
- We hit it with everything we've got.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.280
SG-1 is on that ship.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.920
I have as much confidence in SG-1
as you, but they left over an hour ago.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.000
We've had no communication since.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.720
We have no idea what kind
of time frame we're dealing with.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.800
Let's give them
a reasonable chance, Major.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.800
Yes, sir. I'll try to define
"reasonable" to the Pentagon.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.480
(alarm)

26:26.440 --> 26:29.240
The bugs haven't overrun the airlock yet.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.480
- Let's do it.
- Each tank has six hours of oxygen.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.320
Whoever goes should have plenty of time.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.400
I will go.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.000
- I was gonna do it.
- There is a radiation concern, sir.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.960
My symbiote protects me from exposure
to radiation for a long period of time.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.760
OK. You go.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.600
(Carter)
The top button opens the inner door,...

27:07.720 --> 27:12.040
..the middle one depressurises the airlock
and the bottom one opens the outer door.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.120
Yeah, roger that.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.680
Can you hear me?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.640
Indeed.

27:30.800 --> 27:35.760
You might wanna think about...
hanging on tight out there.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.840
Let's do it.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.760
- Say something.
- One small step for Jaffa...

28:11.120 --> 28:12.840
Very nice.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.360
(hissing)

29:41.280 --> 29:43.200
(whirring and clunking)

29:46.000 --> 29:47.920
Oh, crap.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.360
Teal'c, how's it goin'?

29:51.520 --> 29:53.440
I am returning.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.080
I don't suppose you could step on it,
could ya?

29:57.240 --> 29:59.560
I am moving
as quickly as possible, O'Neill.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.880
- Carter?
- Yes, sir. I'm working on it.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.560
- The door will not open.
- Yeah, hang on.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.520
Oh, God.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.840
His tank just blew!

30:51.920 --> 30:53.840
O'Neill!

30:54.520 --> 30:56.840
- Carter!
- I'm trying to use the transporter...

30:57.000 --> 30:58.920
..to beam him in, but it's not working.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.760
The transporter array on that side
must have been knocked out by the bugs.

31:02.920 --> 31:07.000
We can still do this.
But Teal'c's gonna have to push off.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.320
- What?
- The other transporters can pick him up.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.520
But only if he's
far enough away from the ship.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.480
Teal'c, we're gonna try
to beam you aboard.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.560
But you have to push off from
the ship first. Do you read? Push off.

31:41.960 --> 31:46.960
He's taking too long. Isn't there some
way to re-aim the transporter array?

31:47.120 --> 31:49.440
- (gasps)
- (alarm)

31:50.720 --> 31:52.160
Damn!

32:09.120 --> 32:11.400
- Carter!
- I'm trying.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.480
Got it!

32:22.600 --> 32:25.160
Teal'c! Teal'c!

32:30.760 --> 32:32.680
(alarm)

32:37.960 --> 32:39.880
(flatline beep)

32:45.200 --> 32:47.040
Come on, come on. Breathe!

32:51.400 --> 32:53.320
Oh, yeah.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.920
That's followin' orders.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.160
- Can you move?
- I can, O'Neill.

33:03.800 --> 33:09.120
- Still no communication of any kind?
- No, sir. And still no sign of the alien ship.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.400
- Dr Jackson, are you OK?
- I'll be fine.

33:15.600 --> 33:21.120
Why don't you go back to the infirmary? I
promise to notify you if there's any news.

33:21.280 --> 33:25.280
Sir, I know there's no reason
for me to be here, but I just...

33:25.440 --> 33:27.760
I feel like I should be here.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.600
That's not totally true. I feel like
actually I should be up there with them.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.480
Now you know how I feel
most of the time.

33:42.640 --> 33:46.400
According to the schematic, that was
the only one untouched by the bugs.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.920
- Are you gonna be OK?
- I will be fine.

33:49.400 --> 33:53.120
- What happened?
- He was dying. I put him into stasis.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.600
- So...?
- So we wait...

33:55.760 --> 33:58.320
..and blow the bomb at the right time.

33:58.480 --> 34:02.160
- Which is... when?
- When we start to enter the atmosphere.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.080
Too early and theoretically
the entry could be aborted by the bugs.

34:06.240 --> 34:11.159
If we wait too long into the descent, the
bomb could burn off before we detonate.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.840
Think you can fix that beam-down thing?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.120
Not without Thor's help, sir.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.679
Better contact Hammond,
let him know what to expect.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.960
- All right, this thing's not workin'.
- (scuttling)

34:41.880 --> 34:45.280
Thor was correct. We are going to die.

34:45.440 --> 34:49.080
Come on, Teal'c, lighten up.
We've been in these situations before.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.360
No, sir, we haven't.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.280
We haven't?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.920
The vessel is beginning its descent.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.920
I have an idea.

35:16.800 --> 35:21.800
NORAD has spotted an unidentified object
entering the atmosphere over the Pacific.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.720
- There's no cloaking device.
- It's on a controlled entry.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.160
Heading for the west coast
of the United States.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.640
Of course, this could also be a sign
they've already lost the battle.

35:35.560 --> 35:39.720
This is General Hammond. At this time
I recommend going to DEFCON Two.

35:39.880 --> 35:43.240
Deploy all available assets
to intercept the alien ship.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.320
General...

35:46.200 --> 35:50.280
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson. If that ship
makes it through the atmosphere intact,...

35:50.440 --> 35:52.800
..we have no choice
but to assume SG-1 failed.

35:53.080 --> 35:56.280
We must destroy it
by whatever means necessary.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.280
(alarm)

36:09.880 --> 36:12.000
All right, Carter. Let's do it.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.760
Here we go.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.480
The Russians have spotted it
and are inquiring.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.720
The Joint Chiefs will respond.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.920
I'll have to call you back.

36:46.760 --> 36:50.760
- They're gonna use it to escape.
- Like you did from the mother ship.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.280
- It could work.
- It will.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.360
They'll gate to another planet, then home.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.760
- You had a DHD. They don't.
- Even disconnected,...

36:56.920 --> 37:00.040
..there should be enough
power to dial out once.

37:04.880 --> 37:09.680
This is Hammond. I want the beta gate
unpacked from storage immediately.

37:09.840 --> 37:14.400
Yes, you heard me. I want it unsealed
and ready as soon as humanly possible.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.280
- Where are we goin'?
- P3X-234.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.360
I hear it's nice there this time of year.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.320
(scuttling)

37:43.120 --> 37:45.240
We got bugs.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.720
O'Neill!

38:23.720 --> 38:27.720
Bandit is still on controlled entry.
Present heading 196.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.800
Get down!

38:43.000 --> 38:44.920
Let's go, Carter!

38:52.880 --> 38:54.800
Can we blow this thing yet?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.880
Not yet!

39:04.360 --> 39:07.000
- Carter!
- Not yet!

39:30.680 --> 39:31.920
Carter!

39:39.240 --> 39:41.160
Now!

40:00.000 --> 40:03.920
I understand that, Captain.
What I need to know is: what do you see?

40:04.080 --> 40:05.960
Do you have a visual?

40:06.120 --> 40:08.040
Ten squadrons on intercept course.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.080
Target's changed heading. It's dropped
out of controlled entry. Breaking up.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.040
Visual confirmation. A fireball,...

40:14.200 --> 40:18.720
..headed for the Pacific Ocean,
400 miles off the coast of California.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.240
Naval recovery teams are moving in
to deal with any wreckage.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.760
I'm sure you were right. Commandeering
the Stargate had to be an escape.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.360
I just hope they made it out in time.
