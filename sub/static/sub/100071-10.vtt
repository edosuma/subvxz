Oh, a visitor. Coming.

Ahoy! Are there any lonely
lighthouse keepers abaft here?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.475
(sighing): Oh, hello, Cassandra.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.254
Surprise! I made you muffins.

01:37.255 --> 01:38.881
You want to know a secret?

01:38.882 --> 01:41.067

Nope. No secrets.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.926
So, have you ever
thought about children?

02:10.413 --> 02:13.082
Missed me! Missed me!
Now you gotta kiss me!

02:13.083 --> 02:14.308

02:16.461 --> 02:18.462
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

a good whale oiling.

- Oh,

02:22.334 --> 02:24.185
you might get
some other visitors.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.095
I mentioned you in town today.

02:26.096 --> 02:29.640
You told people about me?
What did you tell them?! What?!

02:29.641 --> 02:32.267
That you had kind eyes,
a beautiful voice,

02:32.268 --> 02:34.478
and no wedding ring.

02:34.479 --> 02:37.031
- There he is!
- (gasps)

02:37.032 --> 02:39.292
I was a fool to let
my guard down with a woman

02:39.293 --> 02:41.961
who runs a seaward-aiming
Fresnel lens!

02:41.962 --> 02:46.040
From hell's heart
I stab at thee!

02:46.041 --> 02:48.968
Oh, my God. Just listen to that
mellifluous baritone.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.619
He's perfect for the role.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.546
Role? Role?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.548
You're offering me
an acting job?

02:54.549 --> 02:58.219
Yes! It's to play Santa Claus
at a small amusement park.

02:58.220 --> 03:03.023

It is the lead. I'm in!

03:54.559 --> 03:57.278
Another crafts project
gone out of hand?

03:57.279 --> 04:00.039
- Yes.
- If you're not tied up tomorrow,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.024
I took the day off from work.

04:02.025 --> 04:05.861
I was thinking we could watch
an R-rated movie.

04:05.862 --> 04:10.124
Finally, the sexy story
of Tony Roma's ribs.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.243
But tomorrow I promised the kids
I'd take them out of school.

Yawn.

We'll go to Santa's Village.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.726
Oh, I hate that place.
It's so crowded at Christmas.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.895
And the giant candy canes
are not real.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.897
But they are electrified!

04:24.898 --> 04:27.315
Well, we're going
and taking the kids.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.485
Why couldn't that be me?

Why do the low-budget parks
we go to

05:16.307 --> 05:19.268
have so many white trash idiots?

05:19.269 --> 05:20.978
Oh! Boy, that's good.

a fat lazy drunk-o?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.828
I came to this park
to get <i> away</i> from one.

is packed.

boring kiddie ride.

Bart, you cut the bullies.

In this situation,

Hello-ho-ho, Bart.

Sideshow Bob!

Merry Christmas.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.917
He's in a good mood.

07:48.918 --> 07:51.178
Yes. This is the year
I get the monkey.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.271
I keep telling you,

07:52.272 --> 07:55.349
a monkey is a huge
responsibility.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.735
I'm raising a kid.
I think I can raise a monkey.

08:09.272 --> 08:12.107

After all these years,

I get to watch the life drain

08:15.704 --> 08:18.965
I can't kill you!

08:18.966 --> 08:21.658
- Want to know why?
- Mm, nah.

08:21.659 --> 08:24.286
I am a trained method actor.

08:24.287 --> 08:25.972
I inhabit my roles.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.215
Like Daniel Day-Lewis
in <i> Phantom Thread.</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:30.217
Or Mike Myers

08:30.218 --> 08:32.294
Why should I trust you?

08:32.294 --> 08:35.222
Because I am utterly incapable
of stepping out of character.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.674
I <i> am</i> Santa Claus.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.579

- Well?

08:58.580 --> 09:01.007
I am a card-carrying

09:04.011 --> 09:06.086
Hey, I was a mall Santa, too.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.330
I still wear the belt.

09:08.331 --> 09:10.683
Uh, if you're gonna spend
this much time with our Santa,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.167
you have to pose for a photo.

09:12.168 --> 09:14.336
Photos with Santa, $40.

09:14.337 --> 09:16.338
Marge, just take one
with your phone!

09:16.339 --> 09:17.439
- Got it.
- Run!

09:18.933 --> 09:21.051
This will stop the jerks
who've been stealing packages

09:21.052 --> 09:24.721
off my porch: a decoy with
an exploding dye marker inside.

09:24.722 --> 09:27.349
You don't think you packed in
a little too much gunpowder?

09:27.350 --> 09:30.201
Relax. I learned how to do this
from my Uncle Two Fingers.

09:32.396 --> 09:34.789
Oh, my God.
<i>You're</i> the package thief?

09:36.192 --> 09:37.067

09:38.620 --> 09:40.954
Lenny. Who did this to you?
Can you say it?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.623
- Eh.
- Can you whisper it?

09:42.624 --> 09:45.292
- Eh.
- Can you write it
with your blood?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.551
Ooh.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.210
I'm a little worried
our Christmas packages

09:55.211 --> 09:56.637
haven't arrived.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.398
Marge, relax.
There's plenty of time.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.259
It's 8:00 p.m. Christmas Eve!

10:02.260 --> 10:07.073

Our only clue is these initials
next to the corpse.

10:27.118 --> 10:29.261
He's not a corpse.
He's breathing.

10:29.262 --> 10:33.173
- I say he's a corpse.
- (blows) And I say I'm not.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.267
Uh... (scoffs)
you don't get a vote.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.131

10:41.132 --> 10:44.301
A fellow Santa
could not steal Christmas.

10:44.302 --> 10:47.779
I know who this mysterious
"S.B." is.

10:49.599 --> 10:52.934
Welcome to jail, Selma Bouvier.

10:52.935 --> 10:54.769
Uh, tell Scott Bakula,
Steve Ballmer

10:54.770 --> 10:56.956
and Sandra Bullock
they're off the hook.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.149
I should've been back
at <i> NCIS: New Orleans</i>

<i>Quantum Leap</i> there?

Why don't you learn
how to be a cop, fatso?

11:05.990 --> 11:08.325
I loved it!
Mistaken identity!

11:08.326 --> 11:12.805
I sold ten, ten season tickets
to the guys in my cell.

11:33.142 --> 11:34.326
What do you want
to go there for?

11:34.327 --> 11:36.162
(scoffs) I'm saving Christmas.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.165
Every kid thinks they're
doing that this time of year.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.500
And as for you, Santa's Village
is closed, I'm afraid.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.003
If I wanted your life story,
I would've taken an Uber.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.413
Well, that shuts me up.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.489
I'm not gonna leave

11:47.490 --> 11:49.175
till I find out
what Bob's up to.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.159
If you don't hear from me
in one hour, call the police.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.370
<i>I have my own problems, Bart.</i>

11:53.371 --> 11:56.089
<i>My mom just locked my dad out</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

11:56.090 --> 11:58.208
<i>He keeps tapping at my window.</i>

11:58.209 --> 12:01.094
<i>She said if I open it,</i>
<i>no presents.</i>

12:01.095 --> 12:03.229
- Useless.
<i>- Don't hang up.</i>

12:08.695 --> 12:11.988
(laughs)
Classic evil villain mistake.

12:13.683 --> 12:15.108
Life goals?!

12:15.109 --> 12:16.777
Don't pooh-pooh.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.145
Now for God's sake,
how can I convince you

12:19.146 --> 12:21.040
that I am not
going to kill you?!

12:21.041 --> 12:24.877
Find the person
who stole the presents.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.362
Very well. I shall begin
by clearing my initials,

12:27.363 --> 12:31.383
catching the true "S.B."
and, if I must,

12:31.384 --> 12:34.202
save Christmas for everyone.

12:34.203 --> 12:36.222
Now let me drive you home.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.466
You want me
to ride with you? Fine.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.558
Shotgun!

12:42.062 --> 12:43.395
Let's roll.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.729
Shotgun means you pay the tolls.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.071
So I'm here to save Christmas,
and here's my plan.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.323
First, I conceal myself
within this box.

12:58.269 --> 12:59.319
(all gasp)

12:59.320 --> 13:01.650
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

13:01.652 --> 13:04.154
When you ride cross-country
in a clown car, you learn a lot.

13:04.155 --> 13:07.874
(shuddering laugh)

13:07.875 --> 13:09.876
- (applause, cheering)
- HOMER: Who knew?

13:09.877 --> 13:11.336
- Brava!
- Who knew?

13:11.337 --> 13:12.546
SIDESHOW BOB:
Thank you.

13:12.547 --> 13:14.715
Now, Homer,
gently place me on the porch,

13:14.716 --> 13:17.142
and when they steal me,
follow them to their lair.

13:17.143 --> 13:18.960
Will do.

13:18.961 --> 13:20.269
(both grunting)

13:22.465 --> 13:23.690
(grunting continues)

13:25.893 --> 13:27.135
Ah!

13:27.136 --> 13:28.970
- And... (grunts)
- Ah!

13:28.971 --> 13:31.323
Godspeed.

13:31.324 --> 13:33.492
They'll be here any minute.

Smithers and Burns!

14:34.537 --> 14:36.463
Since when does Smithers
go first?

14:36.464 --> 14:37.556
The jig is up!

14:37.557 --> 14:39.874
Also, leg cramp.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.085
Ow.

14:42.086 --> 14:43.970
The police are on their way.

14:43.971 --> 14:47.090
Who will they believe?
You or the billionaire

14:47.091 --> 14:50.051
who just sent them
a Montgomery Ward's cheese log?

14:50.052 --> 14:52.979
Mr. Burns, why did you do this?

14:52.980 --> 14:54.981
Ooh, general Scroogeyness.

14:54.982 --> 14:57.984
No, it's deeper.
It's much deeper than that.

14:57.985 --> 15:00.913
(gasps)
I think Mr. Burns is depressed.

15:00.914 --> 15:03.824
Ooh, you're a very
perceptive girl.

15:03.825 --> 15:05.900
(melancholy piano music plays)

15:05.901 --> 15:07.110
- That's close enough.
- (music stops)

15:07.111 --> 15:08.903
I just wanted everyone
to experience

15:08.904 --> 15:12.257
the same Christmas heartbreak
that I once did.

Well, I don't know.

15:37.141 --> 15:40.143
Well, what's on your wish list,
little boy?

15:40.144 --> 15:42.937
A Rockford sock monkey,
Studebaker pedal car,

15:42.938 --> 15:45.940
or the most popular gift
this year, an orange.

15:45.941 --> 15:48.484
All I want is a hug
from my mommy

15:48.485 --> 15:50.370
and a smile from my daddy.

15:50.371 --> 15:53.540
Oh, well I'm sure
there's a hug and a smile

15:53.541 --> 15:56.993

Ho, ho, ho.

15:56.994 --> 15:58.661
Next.

15:58.662 --> 16:00.496
What do you want for Christmas?

16:00.497 --> 16:03.124
I want you to marry my mom
