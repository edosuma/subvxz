WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.252
Storm's coming.

00:03.420 --> 00:07.256
And you boys and your daddy,
you are smack in the middle of it.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.557
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Now, Dean.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.853
He wants us to pick up
where he left off...

00:21.021 --> 00:24.231
...saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.656
Our whole lives we been
searching for this demon.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.492
Samuel Colt made a gun.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.870
They say this gun can kill anything.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.622
We finally know
where this demon's gonna be.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.958
And now, we know how to kill it.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.670
More and more demons
are walking among us.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.344
- You're not my dad.
- What's going on?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.929
I think he's possessed.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.349
I have plans for you, Sammy.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.478
You and all the children like you.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.110
It's inside me. I can feel it.
Hey, shoot me.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.488
I can't hold on to it much longer.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.078
- Why didn't you kill it?
- We got the Colt.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.704
We still have one bullet left.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.869
Get back...

02:01.037 --> 02:03.163
...or I'll kill you, I swear to God.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.540
You won't.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.793
You're saving that bullet
for someone else.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.422
You wanna bet?

02:34.237 --> 02:35.946
Oh, my God.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.490
- Dad?
Did I do this?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.242
Dad?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.204
Dean?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.958
Dean!

02:58.094 --> 03:01.388
Significant passenger space intrusion.
Unresponsive.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.557
BP, 180 over 50. Heart rate-

03:03.725 --> 03:06.643
BP, 100 over 50. Heart rate, 99, 95-

03:06.811 --> 03:09.271
- Tell me if they're okay.
- You have to stay still.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.731
Are they even alive?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.301
Sam?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.809
Dad?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.188
Anybody?

03:56.861 --> 03:58.362
Shiloh County, Nurses' Station.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.614
How can I transfer your call?

04:01.574 --> 04:04.034
Of course, I'll transfer your call.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.915
Excuse me.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.048
Hi.

04:18.882 --> 04:21.426
I think I was in a car accident...

04:21.803 --> 04:24.471
...with my dad and my brother.
I just need to find them.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.019
Hello?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.239
Sammy.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.575
You look good...

05:26.743 --> 05:28.577
...considering...

05:29.996 --> 05:32.039
Oh, no.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.463
Man, tell me you can hear me.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.301
How's Dad?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.470
Is he okay?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.431
Come on, you're the psychic.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.476
Give me some ghost whispering
or something.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.062
Your father's awake.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.898
You can go see him, if you like.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.441
Oh, thank God.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.653
Doc, what about my brother?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.197
He sustained serious injury.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.783
Blood loss, contusions
to his liver and kidney.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.787
It's the head trauma I'm worried about.
There's early signs of cerebral edema.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.789
Well, what can we do?

06:13.956 --> 06:16.375
We won't know his full condition
until he wakes up.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.919
If...

06:19.087 --> 06:21.755
- ...he wakes up.
- If?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.465
- To be honest...
- I'm waking up.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.676
...most people with his injury
wouldn't have survived this long.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.387
He's fighting very hard.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.807
But you need to have realistic
expectations, son.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.017
Come on, Sam.
Go find some Hoodoo priest...

06:34.185 --> 06:35.894
...to lay some mojo on me.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.854
I'll be fine.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.775
Sam.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.113
All right. Here.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.823
Give them my insurance.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.451
"Elroy McGillicuddy"?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.454
And his two loving sons.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.583
So...

06:59.836 --> 07:02.045
What else did the doctor say
about Dean?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.089
Nothing.

07:05.716 --> 07:10.220
Look, if the doctors won't do anything,
then we'll have to. That's all.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.889
I don't know. I'll find some...

07:13.057 --> 07:16.435
...Hoodoo priest
and lay some mojo on him and...

07:17.353 --> 07:18.937
We'll look for someone.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.522
Yeah.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.482
But, Sam...

07:22.984 --> 07:24.776
...I don't know if we'll find anyone.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.403
Why not?

07:26.571 --> 07:30.240
- I found that faith healer before.
- All right, that was one in a million.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.160
What, then we just sit here
with our thumbs up our ass?

07:33.327 --> 07:34.744
No, I said we'd look.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.415
I'll check under every stone.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.671
Where's the Colt?

07:47.216 --> 07:50.010
Your son is dying,
and you're worried about the Colt?

07:50.178 --> 07:54.139
We are hunting this demon
and maybe it's hunting us too.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.683
That gun may be our only card.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.853
It's in the trunk.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.314
They dragged the car
to a yard off I-83.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.067
You gotta clean out that trunk before
some junk man sees what's inside.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.612
I already called Bobby.
He's like an hour out.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.989
He's gonna tow the Impala back
to his place.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.658
All right. You go meet up
with Bobby.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.535
You get that Colt and bring it back.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.164
- And you watch out for hospital security.
- I think I got it covered.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.922
Hey.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.300
Here.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.929
I made a list of things I need.
Have Bobby pick them up.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.933
Acacia? Oil of Abramelin?

08:39.101 --> 08:41.895
- What's this stuff for?
- Protection.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.776
Hey, Dad.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.402
You know the demon?

08:49.570 --> 08:52.739
He said he had plans for me
and children like me.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.450
You have any idea
what he meant by that?

08:55.618 --> 08:57.410
No, I don't.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.924
Well, you sure know something.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.720
Oh, man.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.265
Dean is gonna be pissed.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.189
Look, Sam, it's-

09:26.357 --> 09:28.984
This just ain't worth a tow.

09:33.072 --> 09:37.033
I say we empty the trunk
and sell the rest for scrap.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.287
No.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.457
Dean would kill me if we did that.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.294
When he gets better,
he's gonna wanna fix this.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.672
There's nothing to fix.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.883
Frame's a pretzel. The engine's ruined.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.177
There's barely any parts
worth salvaging.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.887
Listen to me, Bobby.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.933
If there's only one working part,
that's enough.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.686
We're not just gonna give up on...

10:08.232 --> 10:09.691
Okay.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.067
You got it.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.613
Here.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.990
Dad asked if you could get
this stuff for him.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.952
What John want with this?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.538
Protection from the demon.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.668
What?

10:28.836 --> 10:31.963
- Oh, nothing. It's just-
- Bobby.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.592
What's going on?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.485
Come on, Dad.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.779
You gotta help me.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.158
I gotta get better.
I gotta get back in there.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.957
I mean, you haven't called
a soul for help.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.168
You haven't even tried.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.379
Aren't you gonna do anything?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.255
Aren't you even gonna say anything?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.929
I've done everything
you have ever asked me.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.305
Everything.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.266
I have given everything I've ever had.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.187
Are you're just gonna sit there
and you're gonna watch me die?

11:31.440 --> 11:34.067
What the hell kind of father are you?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.284
What is that?

11:49.333 --> 11:51.501
I take it you didn't see that.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.115
Help. Help. Help.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.827
Hey, I need some help in here!

12:27.538 --> 12:28.913
I can't...

12:29.081 --> 12:30.498
...breathe.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.387
Sammy, tell me
you can freaking hear me.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.224
There's something in the hospital.
Bring me back. We gotta hunt this thing.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.601
Sam.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.852
You're quiet.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.110
- Think I wouldn't find out?
- What are you talking about?

12:59.278 --> 13:02.822
That stuff. You don't use it to ward off
a demon. You use it to summon one.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.534
You plan on bringing the demon here.
Having some stupid, macho showdown.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.454
- I have a plan, Sam.
- That's exactly my point.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.373
Dean is dying and you have a plan.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.459
You care more about
killing this demon...

13:14.627 --> 13:16.753
- ...than saving your own son.
Don't do this.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.588
Do not tell me how I feel.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.216
- I'm doing this for Dean.
How?

13:21.383 --> 13:22.842
How is revenge gonna help him?

13:23.010 --> 13:25.178
You're not thinking about anybody
but yourself.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.097
- It's the same selfish obsession.
Don't do this.

13:28.265 --> 13:32.227
I thought this was your obsession too.
This demon killed your mother.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.855
Killed your girlfriend. You begged me
to be part of this hunt.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.734
If you killed it when you had the chance,
none of this would've happened.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.944
It was possessing you.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.571
- I would've killed you.
- Your brother would be awake.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.740
- Shut up. Both of you.
- Go to hell.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.493
I should've never taken you along
in the first place.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.370
- It was a mistake.
- I said shut up!

13:58.796 --> 14:00.839
Dude, I full-on Swayze'd that mother.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.352
What the-? What is-?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.021
Something's going on out there.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.068
All clear.
Clear.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.697
- Still no pulse.
- No.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.658
- Still no pulse.
- Okay, let's go again, 360.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.451
Charging.
All clear?

14:30.619 --> 14:32.787
Clear.
Clear.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.080
Come on. Come on.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.832
No pulse.
Baseline, 36.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.166
- Ready.
Charged.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.877
Clear.
Standing by.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.673
Still nothing. No pulse.
Okay, let's go again.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.259
Charging.
All clear?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.303
Clear.
- You get the hell away from me.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.054
Stay back.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.766
No change. Starting CPR.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.768
I said, get back!

14:55.936 --> 14:58.730
Three, two, one.

14:59.773 --> 15:03.818
- Three, two, one.
Still nothing.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.870
We have a pulse.
We're back into sinus rhythm.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.139
Don't worry, Sammy.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.183
I'm not going anywhere.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.894
I'm getting that thing
before it gets me.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.023
It's some kind of spirit...

15:42.191 --> 15:43.983
...but I could grab it.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.735
And if I can grab it...

15:45.903 --> 15:47.695
...I can kill it.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.172
Can't you see me?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.884
Why won't you look at me?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.220
Now what?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.724
Somebody talk to me.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.768
Say something, please.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.645
Can you see me?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.522
Yeah.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.859
Hi, just calm down.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.904
- What's your name?
- Tessa.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.739
Okay, good, Tessa. I'm Dean.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.825
What's happening to me?

16:34.576 --> 16:35.618
Am I-?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.161
Am I dead?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.080
That sort of depends.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.009
I don't understand.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.387
I just came in for an appendectomy.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.766
I hate to bear bad news...

16:58.934 --> 17:01.269
...but I think there were
some complications.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.773
It's just a dream. That's all.
This is just...

17:07.151 --> 17:08.776
...a very weird...

17:08.944 --> 17:10.944
...unbelievably vivid dream.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.571
Tessa...

17:12.740 --> 17:13.906
...it's not a dream.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.366
Then what else could it be?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.413
You ever heard of an out-of-body
experience?

17:21.205 --> 17:22.957
What are you, some New Age-y guy?

17:23.291 --> 17:26.294
You see me messing with crystals
or listening to Yanni?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.297
It's actually a very old idea.

17:29.965 --> 17:33.760
It's got a lot of different names.
Bilocation...

17:33.927 --> 17:35.762
...crisis apparitions, fetches.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.889
I think it's happening to us.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.183
And if it is...

17:41.060 --> 17:43.394
...it means that we're spirits...

17:43.562 --> 17:45.480
...of people close to death.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.609
So we're gonna die?

17:49.777 --> 17:50.902
No.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.570
Not if we hold on.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.240
Our bodies can get better.
You can snap back in there and wake up.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.621
What do you mean,
you "felt something"?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.498
I mean, it felt like-

18:03.665 --> 18:05.249
Like Dean.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.919
Like he was there,
just out of eyeshot or something.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.588
I don't know if it's my psychic thing
or what.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.008
But do you think it's even possible?
You think his spirit could be around?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.427
Anything's possible.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.430
Well, there's one way to find out.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.849
Where you going?

18:22.017 --> 18:24.602
- I gotta pick something up. I'll be back.
- Wait, Sam.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.523
I promise, I won't hunt this demon.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.525
Not until we know Dean's okay.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.824
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.700
- With what?
- You.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.203
Most people in your spot
would be Jell-O by now...

18:42.371 --> 18:45.706
...but you're taking this pretty well.
Maybe a little better than me.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.291
Don't get me wrong.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.877
I was pretty freaked at first.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.796
But now, I don't know. I'm dealing.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.256
So you're okay with dying?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.509
No, of course not.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.470
I just think, whatever's gonna happen
is gonna happen.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.222
It's out of my control.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.558
It's just fate.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.478
Now, that's crap.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.857
You always have a choice.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.692
Roll over and die or keep fighting.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.070
Dr. Kripke
to Room 237. Code blue. Dr. Kripke...

19:16.280 --> 19:17.905
Where you going?
- Just wait here.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.872
Start bagging.
Ready to go.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.915
Give me another amp of epi, please.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.926
Get away from her.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.557
Come on.
Negative.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.186
- Still nothing.
- All right. Let's call it.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.815
Time of death, 5:11 p.m.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.360
At least she's not suffering anymore.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.087
Hey.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.508
I think maybe you're around.
And if you are...

20:20.093 --> 20:22.303
...you'll make fun of me for this.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.641
But there's one way we can talk.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.023
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.915
Dean?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.047
Dean, are you here?

21:02.219 --> 21:05.221
God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.267
All right, Sam.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.353
This isn't gonna work.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.664
I'll be damned.

21:32.708 --> 21:37.253
Oh, it's good to hear from you, man.
It hasn't been the same without you.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.547
Damn straight.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.092
All right, all right.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.513
Dean, what?

21:49.433 --> 21:50.975
H...

21:51.977 --> 21:53.436
...U...

21:59.401 --> 22:00.609
"Hunt"?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.111
What, hunting or-?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.238
Are you hunting?

22:07.409 --> 22:10.745
Dean, it's in the hospital,
what you're hunting.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.039
Do you know what it is?

22:13.915 --> 22:15.333
One question at a time, dude.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.419
What is it?

22:22.674 --> 22:24.800
I don't think it's killing people.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.969
I think it's taking them.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.055
You know, when...

22:29.973 --> 22:31.515
When their time is just up.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.478
A reaper?

22:36.271 --> 22:38.022
Dean...

22:38.273 --> 22:39.774
...is it after you?

22:50.118 --> 22:52.286
If it's here naturally...

22:53.121 --> 22:54.455
...there's no way to stop it.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.500
Yeah, you can't kill death.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.627
Man, you're-

22:59.795 --> 23:01.962
I'm screwed, Sam.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.802
No. No, no, no.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.970
There's gotta be a way.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.014
Oh, there's gotta be a way.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.308
Dad will know what to do.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.652
Dad.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.624
- Hey, so Dad wasn't in his room.
- Where is he?

24:20.792 --> 24:25.588
But I got Dad's journal, so who knows?
Maybe there's something in here.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.224
Thanks for not giving up on me,
Sammy.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.245
Son of a bitch.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.962
Hi, Dean.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.799
You know, you read the most
interesting things.

25:10.967 --> 25:15.930
For example, did you know that reapers
can alter human perception?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.099
I sure didn't.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.270
Basically, they can make themselves
appear however they want.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.148
Like, say...

25:26.566 --> 25:28.442
...a pretty girl.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.946
You are prettier
than the last reaper I met.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.323
I was wondering
when you'd figure it out.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.618
I should've known.

25:38.119 --> 25:42.623
That whole "accepting fate" rap of yours
is far too laid-back for a dead chick.

25:43.124 --> 25:46.126
The mother and the body,
I'm still trying to figure that out.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.004
It's my sandbox.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.881
I can make you see whatever I want.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.842
What is this, like, a turn-on for you?
Toying with me?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.803
You didn't give me much choice.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.014
You saw my true form
and you flipped out.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.308
Kind of hurts a girl's feelings.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.021
This was the only way
I could get you to talk to me.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.815
Okay, fine...

26:07.983 --> 26:11.026
...we're talking.
The hell do you wanna talk about?

26:13.154 --> 26:15.322
How death is nothing to fear.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.659
It's your time to go, Dean.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.662
You're living
on borrowed time already.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.264
What are you doing down here?

27:22.432 --> 27:23.641
- I can explain.
- Yeah?

27:23.808 --> 27:25.517
You're gonna explain to Security.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.853
Come on, you follow me.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.605
Hey.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.275
How stupid do you think I am?

27:35.820 --> 27:38.447
You really want
an honest answer to that?

27:49.626 --> 27:52.836
You conjuring me, John. I'm surprised.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.214
I took you for a lot of things...

27:55.382 --> 27:59.301
...but suicidally reckless
wasn't one of them.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.887
I could always shoot you.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.264
You could always miss.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.893
And you only got one try, don't you?

28:10.814 --> 28:14.274
Did you really think
you could trap me?

28:15.402 --> 28:17.778
Oh, I don't wanna trap you.

28:21.741 --> 28:24.076
I wanna make a deal.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.293
Dean, are you here?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.591
I couldn't find anything in the book.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.762
I don't know how to help you.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.684
But I'll keep trying, all right?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.437
As long as you keep fighting.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.567
I mean, come on, you can't-

28:56.735 --> 29:00.863
You can't leave me alone with Dad.
We'll kill each other. You know that.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.914
Dean, you gotta hold on.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.794
You can't go, man. Not now.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.466
We were just starting
to be brothers again.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.846
Can you hear me?

29:27.390 --> 29:30.309
Look, I'm sure you've heard this before.

29:30.977 --> 29:34.563
But you gotta make an exception.
You gotta cut me a break.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.983
Stage 3, bargaining.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.029
I'm serious.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.324
My family's in danger.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.494
See, we're kind of
in the middle of this...

29:48.912 --> 29:50.454
...war.

29:50.747 --> 29:51.955
And they need me.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.373
The fight's over.

29:53.541 --> 29:56.084
- No, it isn't.
- It is for you.

29:57.045 --> 30:01.965
Dean, you're not the first soldier
I've plucked from the field.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.384
They all feel the same.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.928
They can't leave.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.722
Victory hangs in the balance.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.516
But they're wrong.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.643
The battle goes on without them.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.479
My brother. He could die without me.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.731
Maybe he will.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.858
Maybe he won't.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.778
Nothing you can do about it.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.369
It's an honorable death.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.830
A warrior's death.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.542
I think I'll pass
on the 72 virgins, thanks.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.669
I'm not that into prude chicks,
anyway.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.462
That's funny.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.714
You're very cute.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.969
There's no such thing
as an honorable death.

30:47.136 --> 30:50.180
My corpse is gonna rot in the ground.
My family is gonna die.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.394
No.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.940
I'm not going with you.
I don't care what you do.

31:02.902 --> 31:06.321
Well, like you said...

31:06.781 --> 31:08.031
...there's always a choice.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.451
I can't make you come with me...

31:13.454 --> 31:15.956
...but you're not getting back
in your body.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.041
And that's just facts.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.378
So, yes, you can stay.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.964
You'll stay here for years...

31:24.132 --> 31:26.592
...disembodied, scared.

31:26.801 --> 31:30.220
And over the decades,
it'll probably drive you mad.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.056
Maybe you'll even get violent.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.433
What are you saying?

31:35.643 --> 31:36.852
Dean...

31:37.937 --> 31:40.314
...how do you think
angry spirits are born?

31:41.649 --> 31:44.943
They can't let go,
and they can't move on.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.654
And you're about to become one.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.198
The same thing you hunt.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.662
It's very unseemly.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.331
Making deals with devils.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.169
How do I know this isn't
just another trick?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.546
It's no trick.

32:05.173 --> 32:09.259
I will give you the Colt
and the bullet...

32:09.427 --> 32:10.761
...but you gotta help Dean.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.265
You gotta bring him back.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.268
Why, John, you're a sentimentalist.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.691
If only your boys knew
how much their daddy loved them.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.151
It's a good trade.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.155
You care a hell of a lot more
about this gun...

32:30.323 --> 32:33.033
- ...than you do Dean.
- Don't be so sure.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.369
He killed some people
very special to me.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.374
But still, you're right.
He isn't much of a threat.

32:40.541 --> 32:44.544
And neither is your other son,
of course.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.717
You know the truth, right?

32:52.845 --> 32:54.221
About Sammy...

32:54.389 --> 32:55.764
...and the other children?

32:56.265 --> 32:57.599
Yeah.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.267
I've known for a while.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.019
But Sam doesn't, does he?

33:01.187 --> 33:03.397
You've been playing dumb.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.233
Can you bring Dean back?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.318
Yes or no?

33:08.486 --> 33:09.987
No.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.864
But I know someone who can.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.200
It's not a problem.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.077
Good.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.621
And before I give you the gun...

33:19.789 --> 33:23.417
...I'm gonna wanna make sure
that Dean's okay, with my own eyes.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.837
Oh, John, I'm offended.
Don't you trust me?

33:32.093 --> 33:33.301
Fine.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.762
So we have a deal.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.889
No, John, not yet.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.726
You still need to sweeten the pot.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.436
With what?

33:44.772 --> 33:46.231
There's something else...

33:46.399 --> 33:50.027
...I want as much as that gun.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.320
Maybe more.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.451
It's time to put the pain behind you.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.621
And go where?

34:02.415 --> 34:04.124
Sorry.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.294
I can't give away the big punch line.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.801
Moment of truth.

34:15.969 --> 34:18.554
No changing your mind later.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.268
So, what's it going to be?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.498
What are you doing that for?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.208
I'm not doing it.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.378
What the hell?

34:50.588 --> 34:51.838
You can't do this.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.799
Get away!

34:53.966 --> 34:55.801
What's happening?

35:05.853 --> 35:07.979
Today's your lucky day, kid.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.901
Dean.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.029
Help! I need help!

35:20.535 --> 35:21.701
I can't explain it.

35:21.869 --> 35:25.539
The edema's vanished,
the internal contusions are healed.

35:25.706 --> 35:27.874
Your vitals are good.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.794
You've got some kind of angel
watching over you.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.671
Thanks, doc.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.760
- You said a reaper was after me?
- Yeah.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.513
- How'd I ditch it?
- You got me.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.516
Dean, you really
don't remember anything?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.518
No.

35:46.686 --> 35:50.105
Except this pit in my stomach.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.524
Sam, something's wrong.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.320
How you feeling, dude?

35:58.072 --> 35:59.865
Fine, I guess.

36:00.032 --> 36:03.285
- I'm alive.
- That's what matters.

36:03.452 --> 36:04.744
Where were you last night?

36:07.415 --> 36:08.915
I had some things to take care of.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.667
Well, that's specific.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.503
Come on, Sam.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.505
Did you go after the demon?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.427
- No.
- Why don't I believe you right now?

36:27.602 --> 36:28.977
Can we not fight?

36:31.063 --> 36:33.732
Half the time I don't know
what we're fighting about.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.151
We're just butting heads.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.945
Sammy, I've-

36:39.322 --> 36:41.489
I've made some mistakes.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.534
?But I've always done the best I could.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.290
I just don't wanna
fight anymore, okay?

36:51.334 --> 36:52.834
Dad, are you all right?

36:55.796 --> 36:57.339
Yeah.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.673
I'm just a little tired.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.261
Hey, Sam, would you mind...?

37:03.429 --> 37:05.347
Do you mind getting me
a cup of caffeine?

37:05.973 --> 37:08.600
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.830
What is it?

37:33.084 --> 37:37.128
You know, when you were a kid...

37:38.756 --> 37:41.007
...I'd come home from a hunt.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.386
And after what I'd seen...

37:45.930 --> 37:47.138
...I'd be wrecked.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.392
And you...

37:50.935 --> 37:52.269
You'd come up to me...

37:52.687 --> 37:56.731
...you'd put your hand on my shoulder,
and you'd look me in the eye.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.363
You'd say, "It's okay, Dad."

38:09.328 --> 38:10.745
Dean.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.998
I'm sorry.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.042
Why?

38:18.713 --> 38:22.507
You shouldn't have to say that to me.
I should've been saying that to you.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.177
You know, I put-

38:27.013 --> 38:31.558
I put too much on your shoulders.
I made you grow up too fast.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.770
You took care of Sam,
and you took care of me.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.857
You did that.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.318
And you didn't complain, not once.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.950
I just want you to know...

38:49.994 --> 38:52.704
...that I am so proud of you.

38:55.624 --> 38:58.293
- This really you talking?
- Yeah.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.587
Yeah, it's really me.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.507
Why are you saying this stuff?

39:12.600 --> 39:16.019
I want you to watch out
for Sammy, okay?

39:16.479 --> 39:18.855
Yeah, Dad, you know I will.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.483
You're scaring me.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.903
Don't be scared, Dean.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.711
Okay.

40:36.183 --> 40:37.642
Dad.

40:57.746 --> 41:00.123
You'll have to wait outside.
- No, it's our dad.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.000
Five hundred cc's ready to go.

41:02.168 --> 41:05.211
- Let's try again. An amp of atropine.
- Come on.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.046
Pushing atropine.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.842
In.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.053
Okay, stop compression.

41:14.221 --> 41:15.513
Stopped.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.557
Last breath.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.480
- Come on, come on.
Still no pulse.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.400
Okay, that's it, everybody. I'll call it.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.321
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.

41:32.305 --> 41:38.660
