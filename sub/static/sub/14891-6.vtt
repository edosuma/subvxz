Well, according to this article,
the first year of marriage

01:24.685 --> 01:26.720
is the toughest
and the key to survival

01:26.753 --> 01:29.556
is keeping the lines
of communication open.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.692
We communicate, don’t we, Larry?

01:37.230 --> 01:39.299
Larry?

01:39.332 --> 01:41.301
I’m sorry.
Did you say something?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.738
‐Larry!
‐Kidding. Kidding.

01:44.771 --> 01:45.772
Just kidding.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.145
Everyone, big news!

01:52.178 --> 01:54.815
Listen, I was just over at
the Finleys looking at the city

01:54.848 --> 01:57.250
that Mr. Finley made
out of popsicle sticks.

01:57.283 --> 02:00.320
It’s Pittsburgh even though
my first guess was St. Louis.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.255
But then I saw that
it didn’t have a big arch.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.423
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.625
Mr. Finley told me
the most amazing news.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.560
Come on, we gotta go over there.
You gotta come and see this.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.762
‐Mary Anne!
‐’Aah!’

02:08.794 --> 02:10.663
Oh, put on some clothes and
come on over to the Finleys.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.866
Come on. Everyone, come on.
You gotta see this. Come on.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.839
What’s going on?

02:18.872 --> 02:22.408
Uh, something about the Finleys’
popsicle stick city.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.377
Oh, I’ve seen it.
It’s Pittsburgh.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.786
Am I speaking
a foreign language?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.858
Balki, we are not going
to the Finleys’.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.193
If we go to the Finleys’,
he’ll talk about fishing

02:40.226 --> 02:43.730
and she’ll show us the sweater
she knitted for her dog.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.432
Cousin, Mr. Finley told me
the most amazing thing.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.434
We’re not the only ones
living in this house.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.571
We have a ghost! Oh!

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
Here’s the topper!

02:54.708 --> 02:56.743
They tell me
that the ghost living

02:56.777 --> 02:58.612
in the room
at the top of the stairs.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.246
You know who’s room that is?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.915
That’s my room! Oh!

03:03.550 --> 03:06.486
A ghost. That would explain
so many things.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.623
Like why the garage door opens
and closes by itself.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.961
Mary Anne, we have
a remote control.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.398
So what’s your point?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.968
I’m telling you,
do you realize how lucky we are?

03:22.002 --> 03:25.405
I mean, on Mypos, it’s a huge
honor to live in a haunted hut.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.774
I mean, it‐it‐it brings
good luck to the occupants

03:27.808 --> 03:30.777
and it wards off evil
and then, of course

03:30.811 --> 03:33.680
there’s someone to pick up the
mail when you’re on vacation.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.550
Balki, there is no ghost.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.520
The Finleys sold you
a bunch of hogwash.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.487
I didn’t even know
they had hogs.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.792
I mean there are
no such things as ghosts.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.896
[laughs]
There, there are no such things
as ghosts?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.998
What do they teach you people
in school?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.537
Balki, the whole idea
of a ghost is a little silly.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.806
No, no, it is not silly.
It is an honor.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.542
You know,
ghosts are very particular

04:01.575 --> 04:02.976
about who they move in with.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.979
We should be grateful that
Chester decided to live with us.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.549
Who is Chester?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.551
Chester Bainbridge?
He’s our ghost.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.719
Haven’t you been listening?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.556
You know, I’m gonna call mama

04:15.589 --> 04:17.591
and‐and share my good news
with her.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.825
She’s gonna be so jealous.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.962
She’s been on a ghost waiting
list for over five years.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.437
Alright, Jennifer,
if there is no ghost

04:31.471 --> 04:33.373
how do you explain
the sound of water running

04:33.406 --> 04:34.641
in the middle of the night?

04:34.675 --> 04:36.843
Easy, Larry gets thirsty
right after we...

04:40.747 --> 04:42.683
Believe me, it’s not a ghost.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.552
Cousin, just take a look
at the book.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.720
Take a look
at any part of the book.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.388
Just a sentence,
just one sentence.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.556
Just look at one word!

04:49.590 --> 04:51.992
Get the book out of my face.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.660
Hey, cousin, if I could
just direct your attention

04:53.694 --> 04:56.096
to this one little page.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.100
Balki, for the last time,
I don’t care what the book says.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.868
We do not have a ghost.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.738
Oh, and I suppose
the oven just cleans itself.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.546
Mary Anne, it’s nice
to know there’s one person

05:12.579 --> 05:14.748
who, who believes
what I’m talking about.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.751
Oh, Balki, I always believe
what you’re talking about

05:17.784 --> 05:20.053
even when I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.890
Alright, how about a movie
after dinner?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.425
Sounds good.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.893
Cousin, cousin, cousin,
if‐if you just

05:26.927 --> 05:28.929
if you just take a look,
take a look right there.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.032
Cousin, this book is written
by a college professor

05:32.065 --> 05:33.867
Michael Williams Fudd.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.903
‐Michael Williams Fudd?
‐Michael Williams Fudd.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.573
Michael Williams, PhD.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.913
And I still say
there’s no ghost

05:46.947 --> 05:49.082
and I’m gonna go get
the movie section.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.984
[chuckles]

05:53.520 --> 05:55.488
But, but there’s,
there’s a whole chapter

05:55.522 --> 05:56.923
on‐on Chester Bainbridge.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.926
There’s even a picture
of my room. Look.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.663
You see that fuzzy spot?
That’s Chester.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.699
Michael Williams
photographed Chester himself.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.834
Michael Williams,
I saw him on "Nightline."

06:07.868 --> 06:09.069
W‐what does he say
about Chester?

06:09.102 --> 06:13.807
He said that Chester was a
really devoted Chicago Cubs fan

06:13.840 --> 06:16.442
and a, a compulsive gambler

06:16.476 --> 06:18.845
and he bet a fortune
that the Chicago Cubs

06:18.879 --> 06:22.082
will win
the 1929 World Series.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.817
The ’29 Series.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.553
The Cubs lost in five games
to Philadelphia.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.122
Jimmie Foxx hit 350
during that series.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.729
Some things just stick
in my head for no reason.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.601
Other things
go right through it.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.578
Anyway, uh, um...

06:51.612 --> 06:53.514
Uh, Chester couldn’t
pay off his bet

06:53.547 --> 06:56.750
and so they found him
stuffed into a trunk

06:56.783 --> 06:58.752
in the closet in my room.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.021
Balki, show me the, the picture
of Chester in this book.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.024
Now, look, see?
Right there. That’s him.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.695
You‐you, i‐if you,
if you squint...

07:10.496 --> 07:15.201
...just right, it looks like
he’s got a Chicago Cubs hat.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.908
You‐you got to, you‐you
gotta tilt your head

07:21.942 --> 07:23.910
to‐to the left.

07:26.046 --> 07:30.150
‐Oh, yeah, yeah.
‐Yeah, right in there, huh?

07:30.183 --> 07:33.920
Oh, Larry, Larry,
there’s an actual photograph

07:33.954 --> 07:36.489
of our ghost in Balki’s room.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.593
I left the room for two minutes,
suddenly you’re seeing ghosts?

07:39.626 --> 07:42.696
Well, Larry, Michael Williams
is a leading parapsychologist.

07:42.729 --> 07:46.667
If he says Chester is upstairs,
maybe he is.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.570
‐Cousin, look at the picture.
‐Squint.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.805
Tilt your head to the left
and close one eye.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.214
Alright, alright, there will
be no more talk of ghosts

08:01.247 --> 08:03.584
in this house, is that clear?

08:03.617 --> 08:05.051
Alright, there is no ghost

08:05.085 --> 08:07.754
and there is no way
you can prove there is.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.223
That’s where you’re wrong,
Mr. Pouting Thomas.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.862
According to Professor Williams,
Chester Bainbridge appears

08:15.896 --> 08:19.132
at sundown every year
on the anniversary of his death

08:19.165 --> 08:21.935
which happens to be tonight.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.738
So if you would be so kind
as to come up to my room

08:24.771 --> 08:27.073
I’ll be happy to introduce you.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.142
Well, I tell you
what we’re gonna do.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.011
It’s almost sundown now,
we’re all gonna go up

08:31.044 --> 08:32.813
to Balki’s room
and wait for the ghost.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.081
When he doesn’t appear,
you’ll see I was right

08:35.115 --> 08:37.082
and then Jennifer and I
are going to the movies, okay?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.818
Cousin, that sounds
like a great idea.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.220
Now before we go up there

08:40.253 --> 08:42.155
we’ve got to go
over some ghost etiquette.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.090
‐Ah.
‐Cousin, now.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.960
Listen, when the ghost appears,
whatever you do

08:46.993 --> 08:49.763
don’t say who you’re gonna call?
They really hate that.

08:57.971 --> 08:58.972
Chester?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.075
Hello?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.078
We’re here.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.783
Well, I guess
we are a little early.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.918
Come on in. Come on.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.862
Balki, when did you find time
to do all this decorating?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.765
What decorating?
I just unpacked.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.202
I wish I had done more now that
I know I’m not in here alone.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.137
You’re not?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.574
Well, just who’s in here
with you, mister?

09:35.375 --> 09:38.779
‐Chester the ghost.
‐Oh, right.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.047
[screams]

09:41.081 --> 09:42.916
‐W‐w‐what is it, Jen?
‐It’s Wayne Newton.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.051
His eyes are following me.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.024
Oh, my Lord.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.028
Well‐well, you’re right. They...

09:55.061 --> 09:57.898
They do seem to be moving.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.267
Well, of course, they are.
Don’t be ridiculous.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.037
I paid extra for the poster
with the movable eyes

10:04.070 --> 10:06.039
and the scratch‐and‐sniff
cologne.

10:08.341 --> 10:12.613
It’s Wayne’s own fragrance.
It’s called Wayne Drops.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.883
I haven’t decided yet
where to put the poster.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.251
Now here’s my dilemma.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.054
I would love it to be
the first thing you see

10:21.087 --> 10:22.322
when you walk into the room.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.058
But on the other hand,
Wayne looks his best

10:25.091 --> 10:26.960
over here in the morning sun.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.229
What to do, what to do?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.298
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.434
There is no ghost.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.671
Chester Bainbridge was just
some guy who was dumb enough

10:37.704 --> 10:40.340
to hide from the mob
in his own room.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.249
What did you do that for?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.217
‐Do what?
‐You shoved me.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.419
‐No, I didn’t shove you.
‐Well, somebody shoved me.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.822
[gasps]
It’s Chester!

10:55.856 --> 10:59.359
Hey, Chester!
Chester, hi! How are you?

11:00.727 --> 11:03.329
Balki, you are talking
to the air.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.966
Now‐now‐now there is no ghost!

11:06.900 --> 11:09.736
But just take that.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.271
Cousin.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.942
Don’t ever be rude
to a ghost.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.880
You see, they’re a lot
like alligators.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.782
They’re fun to have
around the house

11:21.815 --> 11:24.117
just as long as
they’re in a good mood.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.455
Okay, okay, alright.

11:29.489 --> 11:33.359
Chester, if you’re here,
show me!

11:33.393 --> 11:35.028
Come on.

11:35.061 --> 11:38.699
Do‐do that voodoo
that you do so well.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.237
There, you see? Nothing.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.207
I was right.
There is no ghost.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.309
Now come on, Jennifer.
Let’s go to the movies.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.716
Oh, my Lord.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.199
Larry, you wanted proof
of a ghost.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.469
I think we have it.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.541
Alright, come on now, let’s,
let’s not jump to conclusions.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.077
Th‐there’s gotta be a‐a logical
explanation for this.

12:24.110 --> 12:28.214
Cousin, give it up.
We’re in mid‐air.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.450
Okay, okay, how about this?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.787
The furnace malfunctioned
creating a backdraft

12:33.820 --> 12:35.455
w‐which came up
through the vents

12:35.488 --> 12:39.125
uh, which created a‐a thermal
vacuum causing things to rise.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.327
Kind of like
what keeps airplanes up.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.330
Really? Well, what keeps
interest rates up?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.437
Thanks for the ride, Chester.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.406
What about Cousin Larry?

12:56.242 --> 13:00.346
Okay, we’re all safely back
on the ground, no harm done.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.284
I admit something strange
just happened.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.090
I have no idea what, but it has
nothing to do with a ghost.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.292
Larry, I don’t know what kind
of sign you’re looking for

13:12.325 --> 13:14.961
but this house
is obviously haunted.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.930
I’m going to a hotel.
Are you coming?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.900
No! No! I refuse to be
driven from my home

13:19.933 --> 13:22.168
by something
that doesn’t exist.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.303
Well, if you wanna
stay here, fine

13:23.336 --> 13:25.371
but I’ll be
at the Kingsley Court.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.507
Come on, Mary Anne.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.242
You know, having a ghost
would explain why every time

13:29.275 --> 13:31.444
we open the refrigerator,
the light goes on.

13:34.515 --> 13:36.550
No, Mary Anne,
the light goes on because...

13:38.451 --> 13:40.554
Yes, having the ghost
would explain that.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.060
Nice work, Balki.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.328
I’m sleeping alone tonight.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.564
Thanks to you
and your idiot ghost.

13:50.597 --> 13:54.167
Cousin, cousin, cousin,
don’t call Chester an idiot.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.436
Ghosts resent having
their intelligence belittled.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.406
They think because they’ve seen
the whole universe

14:00.440 --> 14:02.375
they know everything.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.911
Okay, he’s not an idiot.
He’s a jerk!

14:04.945 --> 14:07.280
Cousin!

14:07.313 --> 14:09.883
Now do you think
Chester would be upset

14:09.916 --> 14:11.618
if I went down to the basement
and checked the furnace?

14:15.088 --> 14:16.523
He might be.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.526
It was just a breeze.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.094
[thud]

14:21.127 --> 14:22.362
The foundation’s settling.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.330
[eerie music]

14:28.401 --> 14:30.336
Okay, this is
a little bit harder.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.411
[ghost moans]

14:43.216 --> 14:45.185
What the hell was that?

14:47.954 --> 14:51.057
(Chester)
’That was my terrifying
ghost moan imitation.’

14:51.091 --> 14:53.059
’I’ve been working on it.
How do you like it?’

14:53.093 --> 14:55.495
Like it? We love it!

14:56.663 --> 14:58.098
Can you do Elvis?

14:59.700 --> 15:02.969
(Chester)
’Do him? I played cards
with Elvis last night.’

15:03.003 --> 15:04.638
So he is dead.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.544
What is it
with you people and Elvis?

15:12.078 --> 15:15.582
Cousin, cousin, look.
It’s, it’s Chester.

15:15.616 --> 15:17.183
Hi, Chester.

15:23.724 --> 15:28.228
Balki, we have a ghost.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.631
No.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.969
The little guy catches on quick.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.239
Chester, I‐I didn’t mean to
call you an idiot or‐or a jerk.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.208
[chuckles nervously]
Are we square? Uh‐uh, shake?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.250
Ah, you’re too late.
You blew it.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.219
You think you’re so smart
just because you’re alive.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.688
Well, I can fix that.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.123
No more Mr. Nice Ghost!

16:02.195 --> 16:03.730
Nice going, cousin.

16:03.764 --> 16:06.299
Now we have an angry ghost
on our hands.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.669
We’re gonna have to figure out
a way to get rid of him.

16:08.702 --> 16:09.736
Oh, it’s okay.
Everything will be fine.

16:09.770 --> 16:11.505
I’ll‐I’ll just apologize.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.339
No, no, cousin,
it’s too late for that.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.041
Apologizing won’t work.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.543
Sure. it’ll work.
It always works.

16:16.577 --> 16:18.645
I do something to you,
you get mad.

16:18.679 --> 16:20.747
I apologize, you forgive me.

16:20.781 --> 16:22.549
Same thing
happens with Jennifer.

16:22.583 --> 16:25.151
It’s a beautiful system.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.153
‐Cousin, I don’t think that‐‐
‐Don’t think. Don’t think.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.555
‐Cousin, just let me finish.
‐Just don’t think‐‐

16:28.589 --> 16:29.656
‐Did you grow up in a hut‐‐
‐When I explain‐‐

16:29.690 --> 16:31.491
‐I did‐‐
‐Just listen to me‐‐

16:31.525 --> 16:35.061
‐No, no, no, I know about‐‐
‐Let me try it‐‐

16:35.095 --> 16:36.597
‐Alright, fine. fine.
‐Thank you. Thank you.

16:36.630 --> 16:38.732
Have it your way.

16:40.534 --> 16:44.204
Chester,
I am really, really sorry.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.239
I, you know, I‐I don’t
know what came over me.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.709
Just, you know, sometimes
I, I get in these moods.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.577
Ah, well, you know,
I’ve been going through

16:50.611 --> 16:51.678
a lot of changes lately.

16:51.712 --> 16:54.615
Uh, new wife, new home
and, uh, a lot of things...

16:54.648 --> 16:56.683
[Chester moans]

16:56.717 --> 16:58.652
Did you see that?

17:00.086 --> 17:03.189
If that had hit me,
it would have killed me!

17:03.824 --> 17:05.458
Now he is trying to hurt me.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.760
Just, just please do something.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.493
Cousin, you can’t just
make a ghost go away.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.630
You have to drive him away.

17:09.663 --> 17:11.464
Alright, drive him away.
Drive him away!

17:11.497 --> 17:12.397
Go ahead! How do we do that?

17:12.432 --> 17:15.167
Well, the only way
to drive a ghost away

17:15.201 --> 17:17.337
is you’ve got
to, to make him angry

17:17.369 --> 17:20.073
and then, and then
if you make him angry enough

17:20.106 --> 17:24.243
he’ll use up all his energy
by having a ghostly tantrum.

17:24.277 --> 17:28.181
And you know, cousin,
why don’t you try it?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.316
You’re good
at making people angry.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.722
Chester, when you died...

17:37.223 --> 17:39.392
...you were so ugly,
they buried you face down.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.800
Didn’t work.
Nothing’s happening.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.336
‐Cousin, you know, I‐I...
‐What‐what‐what’re you doing?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.574
I think that something,
something is kind of happening.

17:53.607 --> 17:54.641
What’s going on there?

17:54.675 --> 17:55.809
I’m‐I’m not quite sure

17:55.842 --> 17:58.478
but I think
something big is happening

17:58.512 --> 18:02.849
and I have a feeling that
Chester has control of my hand.

18:02.883 --> 18:04.184
Oh!

18:05.318 --> 18:07.253
‐What did you do that for?
‐I don’t know, cousin!

18:07.287 --> 18:08.789
‐I can’t control it!
‐What? What?

18:08.822 --> 18:12.192
I still think Chester
has control of my hand!

18:13.560 --> 18:15.261
‐Stop it!
‐Oh, cousin!

18:15.696 --> 18:17.297
I’m sorry!

18:17.330 --> 18:18.599
[grunting]

18:18.632 --> 18:21.167
I’m sorry!
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

18:21.201 --> 18:22.569
[groaning]

18:22.603 --> 18:24.905
Oo‐ooh‐oo!

18:24.938 --> 18:27.273
[gagging]

18:27.307 --> 18:30.544
Okay, okay, I think
we’ve got him on the run

18:30.577 --> 18:32.312
because‐because
he let go of me.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.180
Maybe, maybe I should
have a go at it.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.616
Alright, go for it. Go for it!
Get him! Get him!

18:35.649 --> 18:37.784
Okay, okay, um, uh, uh

18:37.818 --> 18:42.322
Chester you have the spleen
of a cowardly goat!

18:45.425 --> 18:46.760
Oh, you’re getting him.
You’re getting him!

18:46.793 --> 18:48.529
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Finish him off! Finish him off!

18:48.562 --> 18:50.564
Okay, okay, uh, uh

18:50.597 --> 18:54.167
may, may you fall on your face

18:54.200 --> 18:56.269
with your hands
in your pockets.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.238
[laughing]

18:59.740 --> 19:01.608
‐Balki?
‐Yeah?

19:01.642 --> 19:03.443
‐I think you did it.
‐I do, too!

19:04.477 --> 19:06.412
I think he’s gone!

19:07.748 --> 19:10.450
I think you drove
that ghost from this house!

19:10.483 --> 19:11.952
So do I. I think he’s‐‐

19:11.985 --> 19:15.556
I think he’s gone
from the premises.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.457
Yes.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.861
I don’t hear him.
I don’t hear him anywhere.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.462
Amazing! We did it!

19:22.495 --> 19:26.332
We did it! We drove the ghost
from the house!

19:26.366 --> 19:28.835
[screams]

19:28.869 --> 19:31.605
Oh, no! Oh no!

19:31.638 --> 19:33.273
Balki! Balki!

19:36.242 --> 19:37.477
[panting]

19:38.444 --> 19:39.479
[screams]

19:39.513 --> 19:40.747
Oh, no!

19:40.781 --> 19:42.448
[grunting]

19:42.482 --> 19:43.483
Whoa!

19:45.552 --> 19:47.521
[blabbering]

19:48.922 --> 19:51.792
Just, just‐just hang on, cousin.

19:51.825 --> 19:54.460
I think, I think
Chester is on the run.

19:54.494 --> 19:58.565
I think he’s, I think
he’s, he’s slowing down.

19:58.599 --> 20:01.234
‐He’s slowing down, cousin.
‐Ow!

20:03.804 --> 20:05.572
[both screaming]

20:16.282 --> 20:18.251
[panting]

20:20.787 --> 20:22.255
Alright, alright,
Balki, Balki

20:22.288 --> 20:25.025
I‐I think I’ve reassessed
my previous stand.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.393
Chester, you can have the house.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.896
Just please‐please
don’t kill us.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.798
Please don’t kill us.

20:31.832 --> 20:34.267
We were, we were just joking.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.436
(Chester)
’I hate jokes!’

20:37.704 --> 20:39.405
He hates jokes.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.676
[thunder rumbling]

20:42.709 --> 20:43.877
[both screaming]

20:43.910 --> 20:46.012
[Chester moaning]

21:01.895 --> 21:04.364
Larry, Balki, are you alright?

21:04.397 --> 21:06.567
Oh, Jennifer.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.436
Jennifer, you’re back.
Sweetheart, oh, oh.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.773
Oh, I missed you.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.676
Oh, Balki,
I’m so glad you’re safe.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.944
Larry, what happened?
Did you get rid of Chester?

21:17.978 --> 21:22.315
Did we get rid of Chester?
Did we get rid of Chester?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.284
Balki, did we get rid
of Chester?

21:26.352 --> 21:29.856
‐Yes, cousin, we did.
‐Yeah, we got rid of Chester.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.092
Oh, yeah, he was no match
for the two of us.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.695
Oh, he tried
his wily ghost tricks

21:34.728 --> 21:37.397
but nothing I couldn’t handle.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.867
Chester bounced us off the walls
like two rag dolls

21:40.901 --> 21:43.036
until he got bored
and then he left.

21:46.039 --> 21:48.675
Larry, it was very brave of you
to stay here.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.945
Well, it’s a man’s job
to protect his home.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.980
Besides,
Chester locked the door.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.385
Come on.
Let’s get some breakfast.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.822
[screams]

22:01.855 --> 22:03.123
‐What? Jennifer, what‐‐
‐The ghost is here.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.091
I just felt something cold
and clammy on my back.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.427
That’s my hand, look.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.731
Oh.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.533
That ghost is gone for good.

22:18.972 --> 22:21.675
Mary Anne, bad news.

22:23.043 --> 22:24.545
Elvis is dead.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.422
[theme music]
