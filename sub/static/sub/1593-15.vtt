(snarling )

00:49.425 --> 00:52.041
( rock music playing )

01:26.921 --> 01:31.381
J‘ So impressed
with all you do J‘

01:31.550 --> 01:36.510
J‘ Tried so hard
to be like you J‘

01:36.681 --> 01:41.516
J‘ Flew too high
and burnt the wing J‘

01:41.686 --> 01:44.268
J‘ Lost my faith
in everything... J‘

01:44.438 --> 01:46.099
( knocks )

01:52.280 --> 01:54.646
( breathing heavily )

01:56.492 --> 02:01.077
J‘ Lick around divine debris J‘

02:01.247 --> 02:05.866
J‘ Taste the wealth
of hate in me J‘

02:06.043 --> 02:11.037
J‘ Shedding skin
succumb defeat J‘

02:11.215 --> 02:15.504
J‘ This machine is obsolete... J‘

02:18.681 --> 02:21.047
(whimpering)

02:24.061 --> 02:26.313
(snarling )

02:40.286 --> 02:43.278
J‘ Made the choice
to go away... J‘

02:43.456 --> 02:45.447
Turn it off.

02:45.624 --> 02:50.243
J‘ Drink the fountain
of decay J‘

02:50.421 --> 02:52.127
J‘ Tear a hole-- J‘

02:56.469 --> 02:58.551
( knocks )

02:59.889 --> 03:02.801
(snarling )

04:04.703 --> 04:06.955
(snarling )

04:15.756 --> 04:17.462
(gunshot)

04:20.302 --> 04:22.293
(snarling )

04:26.225 --> 04:28.090
( crossbow twangs )

04:37.528 --> 04:40.019
There's more of them around here
than there used to be.

04:41.991 --> 04:44.482
- Don't know if any people are--
- Shh.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.651
Someone is.

05:00.176 --> 05:03.043
(theme music playing )

05:37.213 --> 05:37.247
(audio rewinding)

05:37.254 --> 05:40.212
(audio rewinding)

05:45.387 --> 05:50.381
Aiden was trying to save us

05:50.559 --> 05:52.971
from a roamer,

05:53.145 --> 05:55.227
shooting at it.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.476
Then Glenn distracted him.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.940
I saw the grenades.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.819
I tried to stop him.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.738
They wanted to just go,
I didn't.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.452
He was gonna run.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.912
Nicholas:
I wasn't gonna leave him.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.418
Deanna:
What about Tara?

06:19.588 --> 06:21.169
I wasn't gonna leave her.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.797
But we made him stay.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.594
Couldn't get Aiden
out of there without help.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.427
Then when we got
into the lobby...

06:32.601 --> 06:34.341
All he had to do
was hold the door.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.851
Nicholas:
...he was hitting on the glass,

06:36.021 --> 06:38.137
pushing my door open.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.851
They were gonna kill me.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.936
But he panicked.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.568
Or they were trying to.
Or they just didn't care.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.024
Noah-- I had him.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.940
I had his hand.

06:50.119 --> 06:55.489
And if I didn't push back,
I'd be dead, too.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.993
I tried.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.625
I watched him die.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.303
Nicholas:
They did this.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.433
It was them.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.641
Deanna: But you all
came back together.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.396
How did that happen?

07:22.985 --> 07:24.941
Spencen
Mom, what are you doing?

07:25.112 --> 07:28.320
Deanna: I need it for later.
We have to do this now.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.120
No guns.
No going outside the walls.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.998
Same goes for Glenn
until I finish looking into this.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.375
Nicholas: What do you need
to look into?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.786
|-- I'm telling you
how it went down.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.579
These people have to go.

07:45.758 --> 07:48.124
They are not like us.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.167
I know you see it, too.

07:50.346 --> 07:53.509
Deanna: You don't know
what I see, Nicholas.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.968
And | see a great deal.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.814
I almost left him out there.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.524
Could have told a story.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.193
What, you think I should have?

08:16.372 --> 08:18.203
They don't know
what they're doing.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.205
- Any of them.
- We'll show them.

08:20.376 --> 08:23.368
I don't know
if they can see it.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.922
How things really are.
I don't know if they can yet.

08:26.090 --> 08:29.457
- They haven't caught up.
- We have to be here.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.502
- We have to.
- Yeah, we do.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.047
But their rules,
we don't answer to them.

08:36.225 --> 08:39.467
We are them, Rick.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.510
We are now.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.232
Noah, he believed
in this place.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.187
I'm telling you,
we gotta make this work.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.110
I sent a casserole
to Deanna's family.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.272
We want her to see that.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.322
Thought about Pete?

09:39.496 --> 09:41.111
About what I said?

09:42.374 --> 09:43.989
Yeah.

09:45.461 --> 09:48.043
Talked to Sam some more.

09:49.965 --> 09:54.299
He said his mom put a bolt
on the inside of his closet.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.631
Tells him to lock
himself in sometimes

09:56.805 --> 09:58.796
and not come out
till morning.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.100
He said he can hear
his dad yelling,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.602
things breaking,
his mom crying.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.143
Last month it got quiet
right in the middle of it

10:09.318 --> 10:11.650
and he went out
and found her on the floor...

10:13.614 --> 10:16.321
unconscious, bleeding.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.777
Pete was just sitting
on the porch.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.832
Why do you care
what happens to Jessie?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.667
You know why.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.672
And I know why you do.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.544
Why?

10:40.933 --> 10:43.390
I've seen you talk to her.

10:49.525 --> 10:52.517
Carol:
If walkers hadn't gotten Ed,

10:52.694 --> 10:56.232
I wouldn't be standing here
right now.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.775
Yeah, you would.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.660
Hey, Rick.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.324
Rick.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.968
You okay, man?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.564
Keep walking.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.936
What?
What are you--

12:52.648 --> 12:54.639
(sighs)

13:35.399 --> 13:37.981
(sighs)

13:40.112 --> 13:41.602
( knocks )

13:41.780 --> 13:43.395
Come in.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.069
Hey.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.700
- How is she?
- Stable.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.612
Hanging on.
I'm gonna go back there later.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.500
I think Sasha might have spent
the night in the tower.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.035
Is she still up there?

13:58.213 --> 14:00.295
Abraham's on watch now,
but she hasn't been back

14:00.465 --> 14:02.205
and nobody's seen her.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.555
Rosita:
It's up ahead.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.061
Michonne:
She told you about it?

14:16.231 --> 14:18.347
Rosita: I saw her going out
one day with her rifle.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.890
I knew somebody
was already in the tower.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.524
| asked.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.435
( running footsteps )

14:42.299 --> 14:45.416
It's the first time I've been out
since we've been here.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.425
Me, too.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.345
It already feels different.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.301
That's good.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.467
I don't know.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.105
After Eugene,

15:01.276 --> 15:03.608
after finding out he lied,

15:03.779 --> 15:08.318
l was screwed up
because I lost something.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.072
You seem screwed up
because we found something.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.661
Noah's dead.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.700
And lthink--

15:24.925 --> 15:27.462
ljust feel like
I was asleep in there.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.628
You were trying to forget
so you could try.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.172
- I don't want to forget.
- So don't.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.433
But that doesn't mean
you have to give up.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.685
You didn't bring
your sword with you.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.896
That's not nothing.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.160
I'm sorry for what happened.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.625
How are you holding up?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.208
I'm not.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.677
We have a problem with Pete.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.392
I hoped it'd get better.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.687
You knew?

16:29.698 --> 16:31.609
It hasn't gotten better.
It won't.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.569
Pete's a surgeon.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.702
He's saved lives.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.238
He might be saving Tara's life.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.702
He's beating his wife.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.710
- We have to stop it.
- How?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.165
We separate them.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.875
We tell him that's how it'll be
from now on.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.335
What happens when he doesn't
want to do that?

16:55.932 --> 16:58.014
It's not his choice.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.970
So what happens?

17:05.609 --> 17:07.565
I kill him.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.601
We kill him.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.986
We don't kill people.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.440
This is civilization, Rick.

17:15.619 --> 17:19.407
Warning someone to stop or die,
that is civilized nowadays.

17:19.581 --> 17:20.821
- Oh.
- So what?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.864
So we just let him hit her?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.374
We let him kill her?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.411
No, we exile him
if it comes to that.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.955
We do that, we don't know
when he comes back

17:30.133 --> 17:31.714
and what he does to them.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.922
Letting him go
makes this place vulnerable.

17:35.096 --> 17:38.088
You really want to wait till someone
in that tower has to take care of it?

17:38.266 --> 17:44.102
- And that's if we're lucky.
- We are not... executing anyone.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.139
Don't ever suggest it again.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.268
That sort of thinking
doesn't belong in here.

17:51.446 --> 17:54.859
People die now, Deanna.
They do.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.615
There's times like this
you can decide who and when.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.950
Or it can be decided for you.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.332
It already was.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.962
lwouldn't kill you.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.757
I'd just send you away.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.477
Michonne:
Got it in the back of the head.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.185
Had to be her.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.493
Back of the head.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.246
She's hunting them.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.479
( twigs snap )

19:13.653 --> 19:16.030
Enid:
Carl.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.859
I know you're following me.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.865
Again.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.493
And you're going
the wrong way.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.699
You knew?

19:25.874 --> 19:28.536
- Enid: You're very loud.
- ( twigs snap )

19:30.879 --> 19:33.165
Can you go back?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.251
To be honest,
you scare me.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.258
You shouldn't sneak out
by yourself.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.135
Two people just died.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.762
Oh, come on.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.471
People always die.
You know that.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.064
We should go back.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.892
Why?

19:53.818 --> 19:56.230
What do you do
out here anyways?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.230
Same thing as you.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.677
(snarling )

20:36.986 --> 20:39.272
(clicking, ticking )

20:47.288 --> 20:49.620
(alarm ringing)

21:13.857 --> 21:17.020
Nicholas, don't talk,
just listen.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.314
Those four people
you lost on that run,

21:20.488 --> 21:21.989
that's on you.

21:22.157 --> 21:25.695
And Noah,
that's on you, too.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.821
Those five lives,
you have to carry that.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.791
People like you
are supposed to be dead,

21:35.962 --> 21:40.205
but these walls went up
just in time, so you're not.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.627
You don't go outside
those walls anymore.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.343
Not by yourself,
not with anyone else.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.016
And that's how
you're gonna survive.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.599
Who the hell
do you think you are?

21:54.772 --> 21:58.185
l'm someone who knows
who you are.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.692
I know what you did.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.608
And it's not gonna
happen again.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.774
I've been protecting this place,
helping provide for it.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.692
You just got here.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.530
Don't forget what I said.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.040
Are you threatening me?

22:16.211 --> 22:19.499
( chuckles )
No.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.503
I'm saving you.

22:36.606 --> 22:39.598
( panting )

22:43.738 --> 22:46.070
We're supposed
to be out here.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.782
We're supposed
to feel like this.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.578
I don't want to forget.

22:58.419 --> 23:02.162
And running
makes me feel better.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.378
I can't forget.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.760
I dream about it.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.422
Being in the forest with them.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.136
I do, too.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.479
Ron's a good guy.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.603
He is.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.199
Does he know
you come out here?

23:31.369 --> 23:34.953
No, l--
he wouldn't understand.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.830
Why do | scare you?

23:42.880 --> 23:45.007
I don't know.
You just do.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.631
Cool knife.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.301
It was my mom's.

23:57.645 --> 24:01.979
What happened to you
before you got there?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.861
Does it matter?

24:06.029 --> 24:08.987
It does.
I know.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.569
Something bad
has happened to me, too.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.283
(walkers snarling )

24:20.043 --> 24:21.874
We need to go.
Sounds like a lot.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.555
It's their world.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.970
We'rejust living in it.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.997
Cool.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.211
You're afraid of me, too.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.925
(silenced gunshots)

26:15.324 --> 26:18.282
(snarling )

26:27.462 --> 26:29.248
(silenced gunshot)

26:29.422 --> 26:31.663
- Michonne: Sasha.
- ( sighs)

26:33.050 --> 26:34.506
- ( walkers snarling )
- Go back.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.292
What are you doing?

26:36.471 --> 26:38.837
I'm sick of playing defense.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.222
So you'rejust gonna
take on all of them?

26:41.392 --> 26:42.973
Yeah.

26:57.825 --> 26:58.905
Rosita:
We've got to get out of here.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.488
Oh, you do, I don't.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.182
- I don't need your help.
- This isn't for you.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.747
(gun clicks)

28:08.729 --> 28:11.971
( panting )
I had it.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.559
Don't need your help.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.950
I told you to go.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.585
You...

28:34.755 --> 28:36.586
you can't do anything.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.885
It worked out for you.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.838
Don't you see that?

28:44.265 --> 28:46.472
You can't help me.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.932
Nobodyn

29:00.907 --> 29:02.898
Noah.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.152
ltold him
he wouldn't make it.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.515
Whoever did this
took what was left with them.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.566
This just happened.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.406
(flies buzzing )

31:14.915 --> 31:16.906
She's tied up.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.913
And they fed on her.

31:21.964 --> 31:24.205
Tore her apart.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.717
This just happened?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.421
Yeah.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.177
How the hell did this happen?

31:45.654 --> 31:48.441
(snarling )

32:01.420 --> 32:03.627
Jessie.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.584
Hey.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.091
I don't want Ron and Sam
to know about those.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.174
Well, your secret's safe.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.811
Noah was a sweet kid.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.482
(sighs)

32:25.277 --> 32:28.895
But Tara, she's--
she's in good hands with Pete.

32:29.073 --> 32:31.029
He's hitting you.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.110
He's hurting you.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.989
It has to stop.

32:46.674 --> 32:48.665
- It will.
- How?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.088
There are things
in his life that happened.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.219
I don't care.

32:56.559 --> 33:00.177
Look, it was like this before
and he got help.

33:00.354 --> 33:04.097
I helped him
and things were good.

33:06.819 --> 33:08.184
I can fix it.

33:08.362 --> 33:11.445
No, you can't.
But I can.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.861
No, what--
what can you do?

33:15.035 --> 33:17.071
What are you gonna do?
You gonna put him in jail?

33:19.748 --> 33:21.409
You're only gonna
make things worse.

33:21.584 --> 33:26.044
If it's gotten worse,
it means he's killed you.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.544
That's what's next.

33:27.715 --> 33:30.548
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.384
Why do you care?

33:44.899 --> 33:47.060
Why is this
so important to you?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.230
Now?
You've made it.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.987
You have a home
for your kids.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.567
Rick, what are you doing?

33:57.745 --> 33:58.985
I'm trying to help.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.994
I don't know that.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.579
I'm married.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.423
Okay?
I can take care of myself.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.256
We have to take care
of ourselves.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.398
What are you doing?

35:21.078 --> 35:23.865
You know Sam asked for a gun?

35:24.039 --> 35:25.745
To protect you.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.455
You shouldn't be here.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.543
Jessie, in here, you can't see it,
but it's the same.

35:35.718 --> 35:37.504
It's the same as out there.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.760
We have food
and roofs over our heads,

35:39.930 --> 35:42.512
but you don't get to just live.

35:42.683 --> 35:46.267
You don't get to put it off
or wish it away, Jessie.

35:46.437 --> 35:50.055
If you don't fight,
you die.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.775
And...

35:57.031 --> 35:59.773
and I don't want you to die.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.361
lcan-- I can help you.

36:05.539 --> 36:09.282
I can keep you
and your boys safe.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.541
I can.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.217
All you have to do is say yes.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.641
Would you do this
for someone else?

36:35.652 --> 36:38.109
Would you do this
foranyone?

36:48.207 --> 36:50.493
No. No.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.255
Yes.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.594
Rick.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.339
What are you doing here?

37:10.104 --> 37:11.560
Pete.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.638
What are you doing here?

37:17.277 --> 37:18.357
Listen to me.

37:18.529 --> 37:21.145
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave, Rick.

37:24.535 --> 37:25.945
No.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.497
Excuse me?

37:36.797 --> 37:38.333
You need to leave.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.545
What are you talking about?

37:43.971 --> 37:45.461
Just go, Pete.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.136
What have you been
saying to each other?

37:50.310 --> 37:52.050
Huh?

37:53.355 --> 37:54.811
What have you been doing?!

37:54.982 --> 37:57.223
Pete, you and me
are gonna leave now.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.016
You come into my house...

37:59.194 --> 38:01.150
Pete, you and me
are leaving.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.152
Pete:
You're leaving right now.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.484
You think you're the law?

38:05.659 --> 38:08.492
You actually think you have a say
in anything here?

38:08.662 --> 38:10.823
- Step back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

38:10.998 --> 38:12.829
Someone who's trying
not to kill you.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.206
No!

38:15.210 --> 38:17.417
- You wanna stop now!
- ( shouts)

38:19.423 --> 38:21.163
Come into my house?!

38:21.341 --> 38:23.252
- Pete, stop it!
- It's my house!

38:23.427 --> 38:24.883
Pete, stop it!

38:25.053 --> 38:27.044
(shouts)

38:27.222 --> 38:28.553
( glass breaks )

38:28.724 --> 38:30.760
- ( fight continues)
- Jessie: No! Stop it!

38:30.934 --> 38:32.799
(shouting )

38:36.523 --> 38:38.809
(snarling )

38:41.445 --> 38:43.310
( distant glass breaks )

38:52.789 --> 38:54.871
( screams )

38:56.877 --> 38:58.208
(grunting)

38:58.378 --> 38:59.879
Deanna!

39:25.572 --> 39:26.903
Ah!

39:36.500 --> 39:38.491
Dad, get off!

39:56.603 --> 39:58.218
Deanna:
Stop it!

39:58.397 --> 40:00.513
Stop it right now.

40:02.818 --> 40:04.934
You touch them again
and I'll kill you.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.524
Damn it, Rick!
I said stop.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.110
Or what?

40:12.786 --> 40:15.118
You gonna kick me out?

40:16.290 --> 40:18.121
Put that gun down, Rick.

40:18.292 --> 40:20.499
( panting )

40:25.757 --> 40:27.964
You still don't get it.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.631
None of you do!

40:31.805 --> 40:34.797
(snarling )

40:37.227 --> 40:40.014
Rick: We know what needs
to be done and we do it.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.725
(silenced gunshot)

40:42.899 --> 40:44.810
Rick:
We're the ones who live.

40:50.115 --> 40:55.075
You, you just sit
and plan and hesitate.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.158
You pretend like you know
when you don't.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.913
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( silenced gunshots)

41:04.087 --> 41:07.375
Rick: You wish things
weren't what they are.

41:07.549 --> 41:09.335
Well, you want to live?

41:10.677 --> 41:13.168
You want this place
to stay standing?

41:13.347 --> 41:15.008
(silenced gunshot)

41:15.182 --> 41:17.218
Your way of doing things is done.

41:19.061 --> 41:22.599
Things don't get better
because you-- you want them to.

41:23.732 --> 41:29.068
Starting right now,
we have to live in the real world.

41:30.072 --> 41:33.906
We have to control
who lives here.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.694
That's never been more clear to me
than it is right now.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.033
Me? Me? You--

41:41.208 --> 41:43.699
( laughs )
You mean-- you mean me?

41:46.713 --> 41:50.001
Your way is gonna
destroy this place.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.381
It's gonna get people killed.

41:51.551 --> 41:54.293
It's already gotten
people killed.

41:54.471 --> 41:58.214
And I'm not gonna stand by
and just let it happen.

41:58.392 --> 42:01.225
If you don't fight, you die.

42:01.395 --> 42:03.101
I'm not gonna stand by and--

42:03.271 --> 42:05.307
(grunts)

42:07.901 --> 42:09.937
( panting )

42:21.915 --> 42:21.994
(theme music playing )

42:21.998 --> 42:24.910
(theme music playing )
