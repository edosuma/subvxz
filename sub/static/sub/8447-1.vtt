When I'm old and gray,
I probably won't remember my past.

02:09:33.808 --> 02:09:36.184
You've got to be young when you do it.

02:09:36.978 --> 02:09:39.187
It's really nice, you know?
To look back...

02:09:39.397 --> 02:09:42.649
and see the arc of your life.
It's all connected.

02:09:42.859 --> 02:09:45.360
How you got from there to here.

02:09:46.028 --> 02:09:48.029
- See the line, you know?
- Mm-hm.

02:09:49.907 --> 02:09:52.409
It really has been an adventure.

02:09:52.744 --> 02:09:54.578
I'm gonna start teaching again.

02:09:54.787 --> 02:09:56.997
I'm gonna take up hang-gliding.

02:10:07.133 --> 02:10:10.385
This is what you had in mind all along.

02:10:12.597 --> 02:10:14.264
And I bet...

02:10:14.474 --> 02:10:17.434
I know what we can do later on.

02:10:17.894 --> 02:10:21.146
We'll go look at the kids
when they're asleep.

02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:25.066
Helen Holm.

02:10:36.078 --> 02:10:38.163
[BLOWS WHISTLE] Go!

02:10:38.498 --> 02:10:40.791
[YELLS]

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.709
Go, Martin. Come on!

02:10:43.211 --> 02:10:45.378
Take him down!

02:10:46.255 --> 02:10:48.465
That's it. Good move.

02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:50.425
Ten seconds!

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.304
Come on, Martin. Ride him! Ride!

02:10:55.264 --> 02:10:57.182
Come on, Elmer.

02:10:58.017 --> 02:11:00.101
Same man, the bottom.

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:05.941
Get off your back, Virgil.

02:11:06.150 --> 02:11:08.568
Tie him up underneath.
That's it, that's it.

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:10.695
Ten seconds!

02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:13.865
Behind him, Marcus.

02:11:14.075 --> 02:11:16.201
Five seconds! Behind him.

02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:18.370
Bring him down.

02:11:18.579 --> 02:11:20.372
That's it.

02:11:20.581 --> 02:11:22.457
Pooh.

02:11:25.253 --> 02:11:26.628
[GRUNTING]

02:11:34.929 --> 02:11:37.681
Get someone! Quickly!

02:11:37.890 --> 02:11:41.601
Get a doctor! Get an ambulance!

02:11:42.186 --> 02:11:44.020
Oh, God, please!

02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.276
HELEN: We're taking you
to a hospital in Boston.

02:12:31.485 --> 02:12:34.279
Everything will be fine.

02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:36.573
Helen?

02:12:42.330 --> 02:12:43.788
Remember.

02:12:44.415 --> 02:12:46.374
What, my love?

02:12:47.251 --> 02:12:49.044
Everything, Helen.

02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:52.714
Yes, my love.

02:12:58.095 --> 02:13:00.138
I'm flying, Helen.

02:13:04.518 --> 02:13:06.728
Yes, my love.

02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:10.815
I'm flying.

02:13:11.025 --> 02:13:13.109
