00:39.084 --> 00:40.753
I got him.

01:07.988 --> 01:09.657
Hey, Wiley.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.075
Hi.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.910
You, uh, feel like skipping class?

01:14.454 --> 01:17.415
Unlike you, Mr.
I'm-accepted-to-MIT-early,

01:17.498 --> 01:19.584
some of us actually have to
attend school to graduate.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.002
Plus I already know I'm
gonna be missing classes.

01:22.086 --> 01:24.339
Yeah, I guess.

01:24.422 --> 01:26.507
Breakfast of champions?

01:26.591 --> 01:30.302
Uh, yeah. No use fighting a
metabolism on steroids, I figure.

01:31.637 --> 01:33.764
Of course, I'll probably
regret the collateral damage of

01:33.848 --> 01:36.934
stomach flaps, stretch marks
and ass sag after the break out.

01:37.017 --> 01:40.521
But for now, unlike you, I'm
embracing the current situation.

01:42.315 --> 01:45.360
I know this may sound like a broken record,

01:45.443 --> 01:47.277
but care to reveal your plans post-birth?

01:47.862 --> 01:51.491
I'm just gonna continue my career
as the Minister's fallen daughter.

01:52.157 --> 01:54.243
You worried?

01:54.869 --> 01:55.995
No. Uh...

01:57.079 --> 02:00.040
No, no, this is...
Really, this is my dream.

02:00.124 --> 02:02.377
Ever since I was a little girl, I was like,

02:02.460 --> 02:04.379
"I'm gonna have a baby in my teens.

02:04.462 --> 02:06.296
We're gonna be close to the same age,

02:06.381 --> 02:09.758
so we'll still, you know,
be able to party together."

02:11.135 --> 02:13.137
I'm glad to see you've
thought this all through.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.180
Yeah, I did.

02:15.264 --> 02:17.683
Safe to assume you're still not
gonna let me know who the father is?

02:17.767 --> 02:21.437
Ah, letting that
out of the bag would make me

02:21.521 --> 02:23.523
considerably less
mysterious, don't you think?

02:23.606 --> 02:24.857
Yeah.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.150
I guess I'll see you around.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.902
Sure, square.

02:41.874 --> 02:45.002
- Would you hurry up, man?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

02:45.085 --> 02:47.171
Well, feel like you're
purposely trying to make me late.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.465
Since when do you care about
being on time for school anyway?

02:49.549 --> 02:53.594
Big party this weekend, man.
People need their supplies.

02:53.678 --> 02:56.806
You got any other ambitions than
to be a small-time drug dealer?

02:56.889 --> 03:00.476
My goal is to one day be
a big-time drug dealer.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.062
Wow, Ronnie.

03:04.063 --> 03:05.397
You're the pride of the family.

03:05.481 --> 03:09.694
Yeah, well, money's better
than being a plumber's apprentice.

03:18.327 --> 03:19.537
Come on!

03:23.248 --> 03:24.584
Shit!  Watch out!

03:28.796 --> 03:30.005
You dick!

03:50.818 --> 03:53.153
You may think you're tough,
but I'll break you in a week.

03:53.237 --> 03:54.864
That I promise.

03:55.698 --> 03:57.658
- Try it.
- Hey!

03:58.826 --> 04:00.077
Everything okay here?

04:02.079 --> 04:04.081
This guy needs to watch where he's going.

04:04.164 --> 04:05.750
Ran right into me.

04:14.258 --> 04:15.926
I said everything okay here?

04:18.721 --> 04:20.139
Couldn't be better.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.184
Sure. Great.

04:33.486 --> 04:34.987
Just so you know, I
really do appreciate this

04:35.070 --> 04:36.531
and it's an honor.

04:38.407 --> 04:41.035
I can't believe you signed up for the army.

04:41.118 --> 04:42.995
Are you doing this to piss off Dad?

04:43.078 --> 04:45.289
Dad's spent his whole
life being pissed off.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.042
This isn't gonna change anything.
It's only for a few years.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.044
Sure, followed by a lifetime of

04:50.127 --> 04:53.297
failed relationships,
heavy drinking and PTSD.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.300
I've read what happens to soldiers
when they come back from combat.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.385
Chances are I won't even see any action.

04:58.468 --> 05:01.013
That's what all the amputees say.

05:07.061 --> 05:10.856
Adam, I heard about MIT. Congratulations.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.860
- Your parents must be proud.
- Uh, yeah, my mother is.

05:14.944 --> 05:18.155
I can't wait to go. Should
be different than here.

05:18.238 --> 05:20.157
Pretty Lake's not so bad.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.993
Still having a hard time getting
used to living in a small town.

05:25.037 --> 05:26.831
Here. Got you something.

05:28.332 --> 05:30.459
- What's this for?
- You're a smart guy.

05:30.542 --> 05:32.044
Thought you might wanna
expand your horizons

05:32.127 --> 05:34.714
when you get bored of
the regular curriculum.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.716
I started my master's
on it. It's pretty good.

05:37.592 --> 05:38.843
- Master's?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:38.926 --> 05:40.010
How old are you?

05:40.803 --> 05:42.805
Since you started your master's, I mean...

05:42.888 --> 05:44.599
Some kids say you're only 22.

05:44.682 --> 05:46.225
Actually, I'm still 21.

05:48.227 --> 05:49.812
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

05:49.895 --> 05:51.188
Thanks for the book.

05:52.189 --> 05:54.358
You're welcome.

06:06.536 --> 06:07.830
Dinner's ready.

06:08.706 --> 06:10.207
I already ate.

06:11.541 --> 06:13.585
No, you haven't. Just come.

06:19.049 --> 06:22.219
I can't. Everyone's going to Kyle's.

06:22.302 --> 06:24.972
You do realize your water's
about to break, right?

06:26.265 --> 06:29.476
It's a pool party. I got my
preggo thong. I'm covered.

06:31.436 --> 06:33.480
Is everything a joke to you, Wiley?

06:34.106 --> 06:35.691
Did you know that your
face gets kind of weird

06:35.775 --> 06:37.484
when you try to channel your inner mom?

06:39.737 --> 06:41.155
You're an idiot.

06:41.238 --> 06:44.449
Um, can you just finish cleaning
up the flowers before you go?

06:44.533 --> 06:46.201
There's two more funerals tomorrow.

06:51.290 --> 06:52.750
What are you looking at?

06:52.833 --> 06:54.835
Dad!

07:27.827 --> 07:29.870
That's funny.

07:31.580 --> 07:32.622
Hello?

07:32.707 --> 07:34.959
Is that your son's car out front?

07:37.169 --> 07:38.671
Who's asking?

07:39.338 --> 07:42.132
He almost hit my brother and
me the other day on Highway 23.

07:42.216 --> 07:44.634
He shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car.

07:46.679 --> 07:49.598
Oh, is this the person
you were talking about?

07:49.682 --> 07:51.684
Yeah, that's him.

07:52.685 --> 07:54.186
Let's make one thing clear.

07:55.104 --> 07:58.941
Chuck has two witnesses
that say you clipped his car

07:59.024 --> 08:01.193
and then drove away.

08:01.276 --> 08:03.362
We expect full payment for the damages.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.031
Then your son is a liar.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.209
I'm going to give you ten
seconds to get off my property.

08:17.292 --> 08:19.461
After that, I call the cops.

08:25.259 --> 08:26.927
- Mom!
- Dottie!

08:27.011 --> 08:29.013
Mom?

08:40.732 --> 08:44.193
Good girl. Good girl.

08:53.203 --> 08:54.663
Should I call the vet?

08:54.747 --> 08:57.875
No, Granddad. He's just gonna charge
us for doing the same thing I'm doing.

08:57.958 --> 09:01.378
Your father's not that close to
the bone that he can't afford it.

09:02.046 --> 09:03.255
Yeah, he is.

09:06.050 --> 09:09.261
- Need a hand?
- Nope. I'm good, thanks.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.388
Granddad?

09:13.348 --> 09:14.767
Granddad?

09:16.226 --> 09:17.519
Granddad!

09:23.525 --> 09:26.570
There's troubling
news coming in from Pretty Lake.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.073
In a population of just over 8,000,

09:29.156 --> 09:31.909
there have been 36 confirmed
deaths since Monday.

09:31.992 --> 09:34.453
Though health officials have
yet to determine a cause,

09:34.536 --> 09:37.790
they have ruled out that it is contagious.

09:37.873 --> 09:39.374
Minister Miller's office
has released a statement

09:39.458 --> 09:41.460
thanking the residents for their calm

09:41.543 --> 09:45.422
and giving every assurance that they
are monitoring the situation closely.

09:57.017 --> 09:58.643
It's all there, man.

10:02.064 --> 10:04.817
Let's just keep this between us, okay?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.151
All right.

10:06.235 --> 10:08.195
I appreciate that, man.

10:11.198 --> 10:12.950
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

10:30.550 --> 10:32.887
Adam, you shouldn't be in here.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.347
Got any theories yet, Uncle Dave?

10:35.430 --> 10:38.350
I'm punching way over my
weight class on this one.

10:39.684 --> 10:42.771
Your dad would have been
right in his element.

10:42.855 --> 10:46.275
Even as a geneticist he was
always drawn to the morbid.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.779
Did you learn anything
from the Ministry today?

10:52.822 --> 10:54.116
How'd you know about that?

10:54.199 --> 10:57.995
I've been monitoring your e-mails and
phone calls since this thing started.

10:59.538 --> 11:01.165
My nephew, the genius.

11:02.291 --> 11:05.669
Now, they say they're close
to figuring this thing out.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.587
What do you think?

11:07.671 --> 11:12.051
I think you're here for
the same reason I am.

11:12.134 --> 11:14.594
None of this makes any sense.

11:15.554 --> 11:16.638
Not really.

11:18.848 --> 11:20.767
Okay.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.519
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:22.602 --> 11:23.645
Wait.

11:30.027 --> 11:31.403
Adam...

11:32.779 --> 11:35.032
You have to leave before it's too late.

11:39.744 --> 11:40.787
What are you doing?

11:40.870 --> 11:43.540
Mom, start packing. We've
got to get out of here.

11:43.623 --> 11:46.710
Something is wrong. People are dying.
The government isn't telling anyone.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.753
You and your conspiracy theories.

11:48.837 --> 11:50.505
They said the same thing
about SARS, you know.

11:50.589 --> 11:53.800
If I'm being my usual
paranoid self, you win.

11:53.883 --> 11:56.428
Anywhere has to be better than
here, and if I'm wrong, we can...

11:56.511 --> 11:57.846
You're overreacting.

11:57.929 --> 12:02.559
Mom, people are dying.
Please, now. We have to go.

12:03.768 --> 12:06.021
What's so funny?

12:06.105 --> 12:07.814
You remind me of your father.

12:09.024 --> 12:11.860
Don't say that. We are nothing alike.

12:11.943 --> 12:13.028
You do.

12:16.115 --> 12:18.533
Mom, what's wrong with you?

12:20.535 --> 12:21.536
Mom...

12:23.830 --> 12:24.831
Mom!

12:26.583 --> 12:28.543
Mom!

12:31.005 --> 12:32.881
Mom?

12:38.678 --> 12:41.765
It's been confirmed that
the disease is accelerating in Pretty Lake

12:41.848 --> 12:44.601
as the death toll mounts to over 300.

12:44.684 --> 12:47.436
There has been a frustrating
lack of new information.

12:47.521 --> 12:48.897
The Department of Public Health

12:48.980 --> 12:51.650
has not issued any
updates in the past week,

12:51.733 --> 12:53.067
though rumors have been swirling

12:53.151 --> 12:56.571
that a vaccine might be
ready in the next few days.

12:56.655 --> 12:59.323
Eternal God, God
of our mothers and our fathers,

12:59.407 --> 13:01.951
our God, we come before you today

13:02.035 --> 13:04.871
not in sadness or despair,
but in joy and in confirmation.

13:04.954 --> 13:06.039
We come affirming...

13:06.122 --> 13:07.373
Stop it!

13:07.916 --> 13:08.958
We need to pray.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.752
No, we don't, Melissa.

13:10.835 --> 13:12.336
Please, Wiley.

13:13.713 --> 13:16.132
Pray with me before it's too late.

13:17.759 --> 13:19.385
Too late for what?

13:20.511 --> 13:22.055
For your salvation.

13:23.514 --> 13:26.810
Surely you must understand
the danger you're in

13:26.893 --> 13:28.519
if you don't ask for forgiveness.

13:28.603 --> 13:31.522
Eternal
damnation is a possibility.

13:33.024 --> 13:35.443
I don't want forgiveness from you or God.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.669
Citizens of Pretty Lake,

13:52.752 --> 13:57.882
as you know, the situation
is increasingly grave.

13:57.966 --> 14:02.303
We are still no closer to
finding a cause for these deaths.

14:03.722 --> 14:07.225
Given the escalating death
toll, starting immediately,

14:07.308 --> 14:10.979
we are putting Pretty
Lake under full quarantine.

14:11.062 --> 14:14.608
Know this is not a decision
that was taken lightly.

14:14.691 --> 14:17.777
A fence is in the process of being erected.

14:17.861 --> 14:21.530
In the meantime, our military
will use whatever force necessary

14:21.615 --> 14:25.076
on anyone trying to
enter or leave the area.

14:25.159 --> 14:27.495
This is for everyone's safety.

14:27.579 --> 14:32.083
Full details will be posted
on our government's websites.

14:32.166 --> 14:35.461
We have called in experts
from around the world

14:35.544 --> 14:39.758
and we are doing everything we
can to figure this thing out.

14:39.841 --> 14:41.259
Make no mistake,

14:41.342 --> 14:46.389
this was an extraordinarily
difficult decision,

14:46.472 --> 14:51.519
but know our thoughts and
our prayers are with you.

14:51.603 --> 14:54.563
What are you doing about
this?  You can't do this!

14:54.648 --> 14:56.608
How long have you known about this, Mayor?

14:57.776 --> 14:59.903
I was briefed 30 minutes
before the broadcast.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.404
That's the first I heard of it.

15:01.487 --> 15:04.448
How are we supposed to run
our businesses? Live our lives?

15:04.532 --> 15:08.036
It's like they've just given up on us.
Like they're just expecting us to die.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.954
It's a human rights violation!

15:11.205 --> 15:12.749
People, please! Please!

15:16.670 --> 15:20.173
Initialize biohazard
protocol two-dash-three bravo.

15:20.256 --> 15:24.510
Deny access into Pretty Lake. I
repeat, deny access into Pretty Lake.

15:27.513 --> 15:28.640
Attention.

15:28.723 --> 15:30.684
- You are entering a militarized zone.
- Shit!

15:30.767 --> 15:34.896
Be prepared to stop your
vehicle. Do not turn around.

15:45.239 --> 15:48.034
Is there a problem? I'm just
trying to get home to Pretty Lake.

15:48.117 --> 15:50.995
- You're a resident of Pretty Lake?
- What's going on?

15:51.079 --> 15:52.872
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

16:03.591 --> 16:05.134
Let me see some ID.

16:06.761 --> 16:08.554
Okay, I'll get it. It's
just in my knapsack.

16:08.637 --> 16:11.182
- Do not move! Stay where you are!
- What's going on?

16:11.265 --> 16:14.853
This is a bio-medical control
point. Check it. Check the bag.

16:17.814 --> 16:19.273
Can't just take my stuff.

16:19.357 --> 16:20.734
Shut up!

16:25.279 --> 16:26.823
We got something.

16:26.906 --> 16:29.075
- Put your hands on your head.
- Take him! Against the truck.

16:40.294 --> 16:41.880
What are you doing in
here without protection?

16:42.797 --> 16:45.674
I've been around the bodies so much
that if there's something to get,

16:45.759 --> 16:46.968
I've already got it.

16:47.051 --> 16:50.138
Well, from what we're looking at,
I wouldn't be quite so relaxed.

16:53.892 --> 16:57.311
You can do this? You
think it's that serious?

16:57.395 --> 16:58.897
Yes, we do.

16:58.980 --> 17:01.274
We'll take the bodies for further analysis.

17:01.357 --> 17:05.194
- You find anything yet?
- No, not even a cause of death.

17:05.278 --> 17:07.280
That bile there is the only anomaly.

17:07.363 --> 17:10.491
- Any theories about that?
- Well, viral tests are inconclusive.

17:10.574 --> 17:14.119
If it is a virus, it's
one we haven't seen before.

17:14.203 --> 17:17.330
No. Viruses come with symptoms.

17:19.208 --> 17:23.003
There were no indicators that these
people were sick until they were dead.

17:23.087 --> 17:25.131
Nah, it's gotta be something we're missing.

17:27.550 --> 17:32.263
Listen, I'm not here to judge,
but are you sure you wanna do this?

17:32.346 --> 17:34.015
There's no going back.

17:44.859 --> 17:47.028
Don't you wanna read the contracts first?

17:47.946 --> 17:51.449
No. I'm sure you've covered your ass.

17:54.410 --> 17:57.997
You understand the ramifications if
you tell anyone who the father is?

17:59.165 --> 18:02.001
Yeah, you've made that pretty clear.

18:24.648 --> 18:26.067
You're not gonna count it?

18:27.110 --> 18:28.652
I know where to find you.

18:28.736 --> 18:30.654
My client will make the final payment

18:30.738 --> 18:32.824
after the family receives
possession of the baby.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.742
Yeah, you mentioned that already.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.202
Your dad was a good man.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.955
I'm sorry he's gone.

18:39.038 --> 18:42.208
To be honest, I'm surprised
you showed up today,

18:42.291 --> 18:43.918
with everything going on.

18:45.628 --> 18:47.130
Thought you weren't here to judge.

18:51.425 --> 18:53.802
In spite of
mounting pressure from inside

18:53.887 --> 18:55.638
and outside the quarantine zone,

18:55.721 --> 18:59.225
the government is remaining surprisingly
tight-lipped about the disease.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.561
What's up?

19:03.855 --> 19:05.606
Stay out of my way.

19:07.816 --> 19:08.985
Excuse me?

19:09.903 --> 19:13.406
Let this play out. It's
gonna happen eventually.

19:13.489 --> 19:15.658
At least we're on hand
to keep it controlled.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.161
You heard me.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.747
Stay out of my way... amigo.

19:24.167 --> 19:27.253
Amigo? I ain't your amigo.

19:29.838 --> 19:32.383
Who's next? You? You?

19:32.466 --> 19:34.052
One more move and I'll shoot.

19:50.193 --> 19:52.153
You're wasting your time.

19:53.404 --> 19:57.491
I've worked too hard not
to protect what's mine.

19:57.575 --> 19:59.618
Dad, who cares?

19:59.702 --> 20:02.538
Come on, we're all gonna
be dead soon enough anyway.

20:02.621 --> 20:06.918
Relax, Lana. I've been talking to some
high level officials on the outside.

20:07.001 --> 20:10.964
They're gonna lift this quarantine
soon. We will survive this.

20:11.047 --> 20:12.715
Just like Mom?

20:14.217 --> 20:17.136
People are dying, Dad.
You can't ignore that.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.721
Are we going to die?

20:18.804 --> 20:20.223
Lana...

20:20.306 --> 20:22.976
She doesn't need this. Not right now.

20:23.059 --> 20:26.562
Amanda, we're gonna be okay. I promise.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.397
Yeah, right. Right.

20:28.481 --> 20:30.316
Where do you think you're going?

20:32.110 --> 20:33.945
Anywhere but here.

20:39.624 --> 20:41.501
It just doesn't seem real.

20:41.584 --> 20:43.879
No, hopefully they'll
lift the quarantine soon.

20:46.631 --> 20:47.632
Hey, about Ronnie, yeah?

20:47.715 --> 20:50.510
We'll keep you in the loop if
we hear anything on this side.

20:53.055 --> 20:54.890
Okay.

20:56.599 --> 20:59.895
No one's heard anything about
Ronnie. It's like he's disappeared.

21:01.021 --> 21:02.815
I'll go looking for him again tomorrow.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.942
You're probably wasting your time.

21:07.610 --> 21:12.365
He went to the city, so he's most likely
outside of the quarantine area by now.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.743
He's probably not coming back.

21:16.995 --> 21:19.122
It's just weird that we
haven't heard from him.

21:27.798 --> 21:28.966
How you doin'?

21:32.302 --> 21:33.595
I'm scared.

21:36.056 --> 21:38.683
We're
all gonna die, aren't we?

21:41.603 --> 21:43.563
Sure feels like it.

22:11.799 --> 22:13.051
Franny?

22:14.386 --> 22:16.054
Dad's dead.

22:37.742 --> 22:38.952
Forty-nine.

22:40.162 --> 22:41.454
Forty-four.

22:42.580 --> 22:43.581
Thirty.

22:44.707 --> 22:46.001
Eighty-one.

22:46.084 --> 22:47.794
Twenty-two.

22:58.596 --> 23:00.933
No one under 22.

23:30.862 --> 23:32.029
Uncle Dave?

23:39.496 --> 23:41.498
Uncle Dave?

24:16.032 --> 24:18.075
You're free to leave.

24:18.159 --> 24:19.452
What's going on here?

24:19.536 --> 24:23.247
Stay away from the border, because
you're not gonna get a second chance.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.124
That's it? I mean, that's
all you're gonna tell me?

24:25.875 --> 24:27.919
Here, you'll need these.

24:29.128 --> 24:32.674
Congratulations, you're an official
citizen of the quarantine zone.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.469
So you guys aren't gonna
charge me or anything?

24:36.553 --> 24:38.680
No. You want my guess?

24:38.763 --> 24:41.933
They're leaving you people to die
before you infect the rest of us.

25:13.923 --> 25:16.759
- How you doing?
- Fine.

25:18.761 --> 25:20.930
In here you can't survive without friends.

25:21.013 --> 25:24.016
Seems like we've got bigger
problems to deal with.

25:25.852 --> 25:28.771
When are they gonna transfer
us? What are they waiting for?

25:28.855 --> 25:31.774
We've been told to keep everyone
who's still alive locked up.

25:32.817 --> 25:34.861
Just following orders.

25:34.944 --> 25:36.237
Heil Hitler.

25:38.072 --> 25:39.699
You're as stupid as you look.

25:50.376 --> 25:53.505
You know the weird thing
about whatever this thing is?

25:55.297 --> 25:57.091
From what I can see,

25:57.174 --> 25:59.927
no one under 22 years old has died.

26:02.722 --> 26:04.348
Don't you think it's only a matter of time?

26:04.431 --> 26:08.060
No, actually I don't.

26:08.853 --> 26:11.564
I've been deep inside
the government computers.

26:12.732 --> 26:16.110
They're talking about keeping us
quarantined for as long as it takes.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.154
Years if necessary.

26:19.614 --> 26:20.948
They wouldn't do that.

26:21.032 --> 26:23.075
Haven't you seen the news?

26:24.744 --> 26:27.664
The fence doesn't seem
like a temporary solution.

26:28.414 --> 26:32.418
Wiley, we have to leave Pretty Lake.

26:34.170 --> 26:36.548
Yeah, right. What are we gonna do?

26:36.631 --> 26:39.717
Just walk out the front gate?

26:39.801 --> 26:43.930
When they change shifts, there's
one section that's left unguarded.

26:44.013 --> 26:46.849
We can cut through it before
anyone knows what happened.

26:48.601 --> 26:51.896
Come with me. Please.

26:58.485 --> 27:00.237
I'm a beached whale.

27:01.322 --> 27:04.241
I don't wanna slow you
down. You'll be safer alone.

27:04.325 --> 27:06.077
I can get us both through.

27:10.497 --> 27:11.874
When?

27:11.958 --> 27:13.668
Tonight.

27:19.716 --> 27:21.550
Okay.

27:26.397 --> 27:29.525
- Where the hell have you been?
- It's a long story.

27:29.608 --> 27:33.070
- You could've at least called us.
- No, I couldn't.

27:33.154 --> 27:35.447
- Let's go.
- Where?

27:35.531 --> 27:37.616
There's a fence around the
town. You know what that means?

27:37.699 --> 27:40.161
Yeah, that we're stuck
here. It's a quarantine.

27:40.244 --> 27:43.039
No, it also means no
one else can come inside.

27:43.122 --> 27:46.292
We have free rein. Let's
go have ourselves some fun.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.336
People are dying and you wanna have fun?

27:49.420 --> 27:51.713
Yeah, I do.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.799
Especially if we're next.

27:55.134 --> 27:56.302
Yeah, you're right.

27:57.386 --> 27:58.554
What'd you have in mind?

27:58.637 --> 28:03.267
I was thinking that there has never
been a better time to go shopping.

28:06.145 --> 28:07.313
All right.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.982
So, where were you?

28:10.066 --> 28:11.943
I'll tell you on the way.

30:11.562 --> 30:12.729
You ready?

30:13.814 --> 30:16.733
Been waiting a long time
for a taste of the good life.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.999
There's no answer at the police station.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.711
And so we're screwed.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.005
I have trackers on all the cars.

30:39.089 --> 30:42.676
If there's any advantage
to being under quarantine...

30:42.759 --> 30:45.470
when someone steals your merchandise...

30:45.554 --> 30:48.181
there's only so many places they could go.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.541
It's quiet around here.

31:15.626 --> 31:18.920
Well, most of the staff has
already left or they're dead.

31:19.004 --> 31:22.465
What about us? Are they
just gonna leave us here?

31:23.091 --> 31:24.635
Seems that way.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.390
I quit.

31:31.474 --> 31:32.726
You know where he is.

32:01.046 --> 32:03.173
I can't believe we did this.
I cannot believe we did it.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.257
More, more, more!

32:09.095 --> 32:10.722
They're heading down Reeves Road.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.809
Quick, turn right here.
We can get ahead of them.

32:13.892 --> 32:15.310
Perfect.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.650
- Wiley?
- In here.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.530
It's happening. I'm in labor.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.115
Okay.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.992
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't.

32:31.076 --> 32:34.079
Yeah. Before Mom died, I promised
I'd have everything organized.

32:34.162 --> 32:35.872
We both knew you wouldn't
have anything planned, so...

32:35.956 --> 32:37.123
Thanks!

32:46.091 --> 32:47.801
No, no. Yo, yo, slow down. Slow down.

32:47.884 --> 32:49.094
Oh.

32:49.803 --> 32:52.764
- What is this?
- Looks like an accident or something.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.774
We should check it out.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.234
- For real?
- Yeah.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.964
Seems like we have a problem.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.299
Hands in the air.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.893
You know who I am?

33:38.935 --> 33:40.854
Mr. Lotts.

33:41.604 --> 33:45.441
So you know I own the dealership
you just stole that truck from.

33:48.361 --> 33:50.196
I know you, don't I?

33:51.197 --> 33:54.617
Listen, we figured with everything that
was going on here, no one would care.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.703
You figured wrong.

33:57.788 --> 34:00.749
So you two are gonna be
a lesson to anyone else

34:00.832 --> 34:04.627
who thinks they have a free
pass to steal my merchandise.

34:05.921 --> 34:07.713
Take off your clothes.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.636
Uh... excuse me?

34:23.772 --> 34:27.108
Do I look like the kind
of man that asks twice?

34:32.280 --> 34:35.283
Dad, you think this is a good idea?

34:35.366 --> 34:38.203
Idiots like this need to
be taught a lesson, son.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.745
Yeah, but Dad, come on. I think...

34:39.830 --> 34:43.248
Son, we're gonna handle this my way.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.339
- What are you doing?
- You need to relax.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.507
Do not tell me to relax!

34:53.009 --> 34:54.635
I feel like I'm dying!

34:54.719 --> 34:55.761
You're not gonna die, okay.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.222
Plenty of people have
given childbirth at home.

34:57.305 --> 34:59.640
When someone was around who
actually knew what they were doing.

35:02.735 --> 35:04.695
Bring that bucket over here, Chuck.

35:04.779 --> 35:06.071
What the hell is that?

35:09.742 --> 35:11.452
Lie on the ground, boys.

35:12.787 --> 35:15.998
Come on, you can't be serious. You're
gonna cover us in driveway sealer?

35:16.081 --> 35:20.545
I'd feather you too, if
I had any. On the ground.

35:20.628 --> 35:21.879
Shoot me first.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.715
It would be my pleasure.

35:24.799 --> 35:27.051
No, no, no. He'll do it.
Ronnie, get on the ground.

35:27.135 --> 35:28.553
Stop!

35:28.636 --> 35:30.054
Stay right where you are.

35:30.888 --> 35:33.558
Sir, put the gun down now.

35:33.641 --> 35:35.268
The law's on my side.

35:35.351 --> 35:37.853
Last time I checked,
you're just a rich guy.

35:39.439 --> 35:41.274
Not the law.

35:52.660 --> 35:55.413
I'm just trying to keep
the place civilized.

35:56.414 --> 35:59.875
Punks like this don't deserve due process.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.752
By making an example of them,

36:01.836 --> 36:05.798
maybe the next idiot that thinks
it's his right to take what's not his

36:06.424 --> 36:08.301
will think twice.

36:10.470 --> 36:11.929
What's your solution?

36:12.888 --> 36:14.599
Get in your vehicle, go home.

36:17.768 --> 36:21.522
Okay, we're leaving.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.568
But be warned,

36:26.569 --> 36:30.155
you have no idea what pile
you've just stepped into.

36:31.741 --> 36:33.451
I live on a farm.

36:33.534 --> 36:35.620
I got plenty experience in that department.

36:45.796 --> 36:49.759
Mel, please, seriously,
you need to get help.

36:49.842 --> 36:53.053
No, I can't leave you
alone. I promised Mom.

36:53.137 --> 36:56.140
Something's wrong. I'm positive.

36:58.976 --> 37:01.979
Please, go get someone.

37:02.062 --> 37:04.565
If you don't, I will die.

37:11.406 --> 37:13.198
Can't we at least talk about this, Gord?

37:13.283 --> 37:16.994
What's to talk about? You stole a
truck. We'll let the cops handle this.

37:17.077 --> 37:20.164
Come on, Gord. The world's gone to
shit. We were just having some fun.

37:20.790 --> 37:23.251
Besides, I assumed Lotts was dead anyway.

37:23.334 --> 37:25.420
Well, obviously, you have a
perfectly reasonable defense.

37:25.503 --> 37:27.380
I'm sure the cops will think so.

37:27.463 --> 37:28.631
What's the point of turning us in?

37:28.714 --> 37:30.800
How do you even know there's
cops still alive in there?

37:30.883 --> 37:34.720
Besides, you might find yourself
on the wrong end of things.

37:36.389 --> 37:37.432
How do you figure?

37:37.515 --> 37:40.685
You pulled a gun on one of the
most powerful men in Pretty Lake.

37:40.768 --> 37:41.894
Gord!

37:43.688 --> 37:46.274
Gord, Wiley's in labor. Something's wrong.

37:46.357 --> 37:48.108
I need your help.

37:50.069 --> 37:52.112
Your lucky day. Get in.

37:53.281 --> 37:55.950
You boys can find your way home.

38:28.816 --> 38:29.942
Hello?

38:33.571 --> 38:34.822
Hello?

38:49.420 --> 38:52.673
Trust me, there's nowhere for you to go.

38:57.428 --> 38:59.639
Hey, Wiley. How you feelin'?

39:01.766 --> 39:03.058
I'm gonna die.

39:03.142 --> 39:04.644
No, you're not.

39:04.727 --> 39:08.147
Okay. It's okay.

39:12.568 --> 39:16.364
Okay, there's things I can do,
but you're gonna have to be tough.

39:17.573 --> 39:19.074
I can't do this.

39:20.159 --> 39:22.495
The baby's just gonna be dead anyway.

39:23.413 --> 39:25.080
No, it won't.

39:30.795 --> 39:31.962
Get out.

39:33.297 --> 39:34.382
Get out!

39:45.267 --> 39:46.936
Kneel down.

39:47.019 --> 39:48.604
You don't need to do this.

39:51.691 --> 39:54.276
Not so tough now, are you, amigo?

39:59.239 --> 40:02.284
Anything you wanna say
before I blow your brains out?

40:03.368 --> 40:05.705
I shoulda killed you when I had the chance.

40:07.998 --> 40:09.083
Drop the gun.

40:11.126 --> 40:12.503
I said drop the gun.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.679
Put it on the ground.

40:27.351 --> 40:28.894
Kick it towards me.

40:52.543 --> 40:53.919
Get in the cell.

40:55.004 --> 40:56.005
What?

40:57.297 --> 40:59.008
I said, get in the cell.

41:08.275 --> 41:10.277
You're almost there. Come
on, one more big push.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.238
- I can't.
- You have to.

41:13.322 --> 41:14.573
You try doing this, you dick!

41:14.656 --> 41:16.575
- She doesn't mean that.
- Yes, I do!

41:16.658 --> 41:19.119
That's all right. I've been called
worse. Come on. Push, damn it, push!

41:19.203 --> 41:21.538
- Come on! Come on, Wiley, push!
- No!

41:21.621 --> 41:23.791
- I can't. I can't!
- Harder! Push!

41:23.874 --> 41:25.334
Yes, you can. Push!

41:25.417 --> 41:26.585
Push!

41:49.566 --> 41:51.735
Is it... is it alive?

41:51.819 --> 41:52.820
It's a boy.

41:54.404 --> 41:56.656
And it's alive and kicking.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.917
But for how long?

42:24.852 --> 42:27.312
- Fire!
- Take him down!
