WEBVTT

00:01.465 --> 00:04.034
(Nola) Where the hell is he?!
Ah!

00:04.067 --> 00:07.537
(Jeremy) Oh!
(Gasps)

00:07.571 --> 00:09.739
(Grunts) Nick.

00:09.773 --> 00:12.275
What the hell
is going on here?

00:12.309 --> 00:14.578
It's under control,
Nick.

00:16.813 --> 00:19.116
(Groans)

00:19.149 --> 00:21.451
Nola...
Put the knife down.

00:21.485 --> 00:23.587
It's--
it's a letter opener.
Jeremy.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.623
Not until he tells me
where my brother is.

00:26.656 --> 00:29.459
Your brother?
Yeah,
Simon's holding him hostage.

00:29.493 --> 00:31.761
(Breathes erratically)

00:31.795 --> 00:35.565
Nola...
Listen to me.

00:35.599 --> 00:37.434
Just step back--
you step back, Nick.

00:37.467 --> 00:40.270
Jeremy, stay out of this.
You were never here.

00:40.303 --> 00:44.407
Look, nola, I am gonna
have to call the police.
No, no police,

00:44.441 --> 00:46.743
no hospitals.
Oh, all right.

00:46.776 --> 00:49.346
So we'll just stand here
until he bleeds to death

00:49.379 --> 00:51.114
and you're arrested
for murder.

00:51.148 --> 00:53.283
Tell me where he is!

00:53.316 --> 00:55.318
All right, look...

00:55.352 --> 00:57.454
We all want something here--

00:57.487 --> 01:00.357
she wants her brother,
and you want to live--

01:00.390 --> 01:03.560
so tell her
where her brother is.
I will cut your throat.

01:03.593 --> 01:05.795
Now.
Go to hell.

01:05.829 --> 01:09.299
All right. Fine.

01:09.332 --> 01:11.701
We'll just stand here...

01:11.735 --> 01:13.637
And watch you die.

01:17.507 --> 01:20.510
(Whispers)
Tell me where he is.

01:20.544 --> 01:22.212
Lausanne.

01:22.245 --> 01:25.315
Lausanne, Switzerland.

01:25.348 --> 01:28.752
The address is taped to the top
of the safe. It's open.

01:28.785 --> 01:31.388
(Grunts and breathes heavily)

01:31.421 --> 01:34.324
Just... untie me.
I said
we all want something here,

01:34.357 --> 01:36.026
and that includes me.

01:36.059 --> 01:38.094
I'm listening.

01:38.128 --> 01:40.397
Here's the deal--
I'll get you medical attention,

01:40.430 --> 01:43.466
I'll save your life
if you stay out of Karen's.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.069
Karen's?

01:46.102 --> 01:47.571
She's carrying my baby.

01:47.604 --> 01:49.573
Yeah, I know,
and I'm asking you

01:49.606 --> 01:52.342
to stay away from
both of them, you understand?

01:52.375 --> 01:55.078
I am not the bad guy here.
If you just untie me--

01:55.111 --> 01:59.082
say you understand, and I will
listen to your story later.

01:59.115 --> 02:02.085
(Nola)
The address. I got it.

02:07.757 --> 02:09.726
I understand.

02:09.758 --> 02:12.195
I'll stay away.
All right.

02:12.229 --> 02:14.464
I'll stay aw--

02:18.134 --> 02:20.103
(sighs)

02:20.136 --> 02:23.607
(Tripp) You did the right thing,
bringing him here.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.776
We have so many questions
to be answered.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.778
Like how it just so happens
your biggest rival,

02:28.812 --> 02:30.714
the man
who used your daughter

02:30.747 --> 02:33.416
to force his way
into the company,

02:33.450 --> 02:35.385
is in league with nola lyons,

02:35.418 --> 02:37.554
the woman who prosecuted
your wife for murder?

02:37.587 --> 02:40.190
And now serves as my son's
chief of staff.

02:40.223 --> 02:41.424
Exactly.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.126
Good evening,
gentlemen.

02:43.159 --> 02:44.427
Good evening.

02:44.461 --> 02:46.763
If you two would be
so kind as to excuse me,

02:46.796 --> 02:49.532
I need to change the dressing
on Mr. elder's wound.
Certainly.

02:49.566 --> 02:51.034
Yes, of course.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.535
Let's go have a chat

02:52.569 --> 02:54.571
with our little troublemaker,
shall we?

02:57.140 --> 03:00.510
You can't keep me here
against my will.
(Nick) No, we can't.

03:00.543 --> 03:03.146
But I can
call the air marshals

03:03.179 --> 03:05.682
and let them know
you're fleeing to Switzerland

03:05.715 --> 03:07.550
just hours after
an attempted murder

03:07.584 --> 03:09.653
and have you sent away
for 10 to 20.

03:09.686 --> 03:13.089
What have you and Mr. elder
been up to, Ms. lyons?
Ask him, inspector.

03:13.123 --> 03:15.625
Nola.
I didn't have a choice.

03:15.659 --> 03:18.028
I stopped having a choice
the day Simon took my brother.

03:18.061 --> 03:20.764
So this is
all Simon's idea,

03:20.797 --> 03:23.466
your becoming Patrick's
chief of staff?
Yes.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.303
And your prosecution
of my wife?
My entire involvement

03:26.336 --> 03:29.039
with this lunatic family
was Simon elder's idea.

03:29.072 --> 03:32.175
I told you.
You need to talk to him.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.145
Ms. lyons,
if you've misled us,

03:35.178 --> 03:37.147
if you've misrepresented
yourself in any way,

03:37.180 --> 03:40.283
you'll pay
a very steep price.
I told you everything
that I know.

03:40.317 --> 03:42.552
Let me go see my brother,
please.

03:45.555 --> 03:47.023
(Jeremy) How'd
the inquisition go?

03:47.057 --> 03:48.525
As expected.

03:48.558 --> 03:51.528
Thankfully they let me go
before rolling out the rack.

03:51.561 --> 03:53.530
And where are you
motoring off to?

03:53.563 --> 03:56.533
Well, um, I've gotta go
pick up my brother now

03:56.566 --> 03:59.536
and then--
maximum. Maria packed me.
I'm all set.

03:59.569 --> 04:03.073
We can take the jet.
Jeremy, you're not
coming with me.

04:03.106 --> 04:05.408
I have to do this
on my own.

04:05.442 --> 04:07.410
Okay,
but when you come back,

04:07.444 --> 04:10.347
you and me are going on
a Simon-free,

04:10.380 --> 04:14.417
murder-free,
amnesia-free vacation.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.122
I'm not coming back.

04:19.154 --> 04:21.257
I'm taking Justin home
to Shanghai

04:21.291 --> 04:23.126
and I'm staying there.

04:25.795 --> 04:28.565
You can't just leave.

04:28.598 --> 04:30.734
I can and I am.

04:30.767 --> 04:34.304
I'm sorry.

04:48.685 --> 04:50.720
Good-bye.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.769
(Sighs) Any change?

05:05.802 --> 05:09.139
Vitals are weak
but steady.

05:09.172 --> 05:11.107
Apparently the letter opener
almost pierced his lung.

05:11.141 --> 05:14.110
The doctor said he could
come to at any time.

05:14.144 --> 05:17.046
Everywhere we turn,

05:17.080 --> 05:20.350
there are wolves
at the doors.

05:20.383 --> 05:23.086
We have yet another
pressing matter.

05:23.119 --> 05:25.555
Yeah, what's that?

05:25.588 --> 05:28.758
I got a call from Richard Gorda
over at random house.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.760
He said that
Smith and Shepard

05:30.794 --> 05:32.796
have signed a contract

05:32.829 --> 05:34.631
commissioning
an unauthorized book

05:34.664 --> 05:36.466
on the Darling family.

05:36.499 --> 05:39.235
Well, it's likely
just gossip, Tripp.

05:39.269 --> 05:40.737
Shouldn't be a problem.

05:40.770 --> 05:43.072
I'm afraid this is
probably not just gossip.

05:43.106 --> 05:47.110
Richard described it
as a tell-all book.

05:47.143 --> 05:49.813
And the author
in this instance...

05:49.846 --> 05:53.082
May well be the first person
actually equipped

05:53.116 --> 05:56.219
to do just that.

05:56.252 --> 05:58.421
Who's the author?

05:58.455 --> 06:02.192
Your soon-to-be
ex-wife Lisa.

06:06.229 --> 06:11.634
♪♪

06:21.444 --> 06:23.413
This is the third
in the series.

06:23.446 --> 06:26.416
The first two went to
Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed.

06:26.449 --> 06:29.152
So this is yours
if you want it.

06:29.185 --> 06:30.687
Lisa.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.189
I'll be with you
in just a moment, okay?

06:33.223 --> 06:35.058
Nick, I was wondering

06:35.091 --> 06:37.494
how long it would take you
to show up.
What are you doing, Lisa?

06:37.527 --> 06:40.029
I'm working.
What are you doing?

06:40.063 --> 06:43.399
Let's not play any games.
I know about the book.

06:43.433 --> 06:47.103
So what did you tell the editors
to get them to sign on?

06:47.136 --> 06:49.772
It must have been juicy.
Just the truth.
How sad is that?

06:49.806 --> 06:52.041
(Sighs)

06:54.577 --> 06:57.547
If this is about money--
why, you planning on bribing me
out of writing the book?

06:57.580 --> 06:59.916
Is there anything you think
the Darlings' money won't buy?

06:59.949 --> 07:03.586
You want to get back at me for
whatever you think I've done--
I'm not trying
to get back at anybody.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.389
I am taking care of myself.
The standard of living

07:06.422 --> 07:08.758
for most women after divorce
goes down considerably,

07:08.791 --> 07:10.760
and I won't
let that happen to me.

07:10.793 --> 07:12.762
I won't let it happen
to Kiki.

07:12.795 --> 07:14.764
D-do you realize
what you're becoming?

07:14.797 --> 07:16.633
I'm just curious.

07:16.666 --> 07:19.402
You know what? Unless you
want to buy a painting,

07:19.435 --> 07:21.404
I think you should go.

07:21.437 --> 07:24.207
(Sighs)

07:24.240 --> 07:26.276

07:26.309 --> 07:28.311
Ah! Ah!

07:28.344 --> 07:31.781
Oh, my.
You are something else.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.316
Mm.

07:33.349 --> 07:35.285
That was one hell
of a lunch meeting.

07:35.318 --> 07:36.185
(Laughs)

07:36.219 --> 07:39.389
Well, I told you
I could make you happy...

07:39.422 --> 07:42.091
Over and over again.
(Laughs)

07:42.125 --> 07:45.094
Oh, you've... made me
more than happy.

07:45.128 --> 07:47.597
You've reminded me
that happiness

07:47.630 --> 07:51.200
is something
that I can still feel.

07:51.234 --> 07:53.069
Thank you.

07:53.102 --> 07:57.273
Well, hold on
to that feeling.

07:57.307 --> 08:00.310
Where... do you think
you're going?

08:00.343 --> 08:01.811
Well, I'm sorry.

08:01.844 --> 08:04.347
I have
a parent-teacher conference

08:04.380 --> 08:06.549
at my kid's school.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.717
Okay.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.052
(Laughs)

08:09.085 --> 08:11.120
Can I see you later?

08:11.154 --> 08:12.422
Patrick...

08:12.455 --> 08:14.457
This is just sex, remember?

08:14.490 --> 08:16.459
I mean, I have to go home.

08:16.492 --> 08:19.095
I'm... not talking
about sex.

08:19.128 --> 08:21.497
I want us to...

08:21.531 --> 08:23.600
Have a date.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.101
A date?

08:25.134 --> 08:27.103
Yes. We can hang out
and talk,

08:27.136 --> 08:30.106
and after we're done
if you want to go home,

08:30.139 --> 08:32.041
you go home.

08:32.075 --> 08:35.178
I just...
Want to spend time with you.

08:37.813 --> 08:40.316
Well, there's an exhibit
at the Logan gallery

08:40.350 --> 08:41.784
I want to see.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.285
I love the Logan.

08:43.318 --> 08:44.621
(Laughs)

08:44.654 --> 08:46.456
Let's do it.

08:46.489 --> 08:50.126
Okay. Then it's a date.

08:51.594 --> 08:53.696
Mm.

08:55.798 --> 08:57.767
(Charles) How'd it go
with my wife?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.803
You two have a good time?

09:00.837 --> 09:02.639
When?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.707
Last night?

09:04.741 --> 09:06.709
(Laughs) I know
she had a good time.

09:06.743 --> 09:08.211
She was still gushing

09:08.244 --> 09:10.780
when I saw her
at breakfast this morning.

09:10.813 --> 09:13.383
Yeah, she, uh,
she had some fun.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.118
Oh, what's the matter,
senator?

09:15.151 --> 09:17.687
You think just because
my shoes match my belt

09:17.720 --> 09:21.524
that I can't appreciate
my own wife as a woman?

09:21.557 --> 09:24.027
Come on. You can say it.

09:24.060 --> 09:27.430
Say, "congressman, your wife
was a fine piece"--
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:27.463 --> 09:31.167
Is it all right if we don't
talk about this right here?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.169
However you want to play it.

09:33.202 --> 09:35.171
(Breathing heavily)

09:35.204 --> 09:37.507
Look... I gotta go.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.143
Sorry to cut this short.
I'm running late.

09:40.176 --> 09:42.178
No worries but, you know,
we never did

09:42.211 --> 09:44.180
talk all the details
of your bio-fuel project.

09:44.213 --> 09:46.182
What do you say
we have dinner tonight?

09:46.215 --> 09:49.085
Sorry, uh, can't. Booked.
Some other time.

09:49.118 --> 09:52.021
Some other time soon,
senator.

09:52.055 --> 09:54.123
Definitely.

11:03.526 --> 11:06.129
(Groans)

11:06.162 --> 11:08.464
How am I gonna
stick this out?

11:08.498 --> 11:10.600
I mean, one week is fine,

11:10.633 --> 11:14.704
but after that, it just becomes
a five-star sty.

11:14.737 --> 11:17.173
Oh.

11:17.206 --> 11:19.041
Well...

11:19.075 --> 11:21.477
We could
spruce it up a bit.

11:21.511 --> 11:24.147
I have some ideas.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.650
(Groans)

11:27.683 --> 11:30.753
(Doorbell rings)

11:36.058 --> 11:38.361
I have something
to give you.

11:40.496 --> 11:42.265
What are you doing?

11:42.298 --> 11:45.635
Nola lyons...
Don't say
those next four words.

11:45.668 --> 11:47.436
Will you marry me?

11:51.774 --> 11:55.178
I love you.

11:55.211 --> 11:57.513
Come on. Let's do it...

11:57.547 --> 11:59.515
All of it--

11:59.549 --> 12:01.017
the white picket fence,

12:01.050 --> 12:02.518
the mixed-breed spawn.

12:02.552 --> 12:05.788
I don't know how to barbecue,
but I could learn.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.623
(Laughs)

12:10.660 --> 12:13.696
Jeremy, I have spent
the last five years

12:13.729 --> 12:15.698
trying to reunite my family.

12:15.731 --> 12:19.468
I can be a part
of your family, too.

12:19.502 --> 12:21.704
Bring me along to the reunion.
I'll pay.

12:21.737 --> 12:25.107
No.

12:25.141 --> 12:29.045
I love you. I do.

12:29.078 --> 12:30.713
But I have to leave.

12:30.746 --> 12:32.748
This--this life isn't real.

12:32.782 --> 12:35.017
But I'm real. We're real.

12:35.051 --> 12:38.087
Okay, granted,
we started out a little fake,

12:38.120 --> 12:40.356
but we turned the corner
somewhere along the way.

12:40.389 --> 12:42.258
We got real.

12:49.832 --> 12:53.603
Just let me go.

12:53.636 --> 12:55.471
Please.

13:05.414 --> 13:07.416
(Ring box closes)

13:14.657 --> 13:17.059
(Karen) He looks
so peaceful, doesn't he?

13:17.093 --> 13:19.061
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:19.095 --> 13:21.564
Maybe he's dead.

13:21.597 --> 13:24.166
A girl can dream,
can't she?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.770
Hey, way to go.

13:27.803 --> 13:29.572
Karen.
You said you would

13:29.605 --> 13:31.574
keep Simon away
from me and the baby,

13:31.607 --> 13:33.576
and now he lives here.

13:33.609 --> 13:35.745
Come on, Karen. I agreed
to bring him here--

13:35.778 --> 13:38.547
saved his life essentially--
to get a promise from him

13:38.581 --> 13:41.651
to leave you
and the baby alone.
And you believed him?

13:41.684 --> 13:43.619
This is one time
that Simon elder

13:43.653 --> 13:46.756
is gonna live up to his word,
I promise.

13:46.789 --> 13:48.457
Look, Karen, eventually,

13:48.491 --> 13:50.760
the guy is gonna want to have
contact with his child,

13:50.793 --> 13:53.296
but as of right now,
he is out of the picture.

13:53.329 --> 13:55.298
I promise.

13:55.331 --> 13:58.167
Okay.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.369
Good,
because this baby...

14:00.403 --> 14:02.038
Yeah?

14:02.071 --> 14:03.339
(Sighs)

14:03.372 --> 14:05.107
I kinda love it.

14:05.141 --> 14:07.610
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:07.643 --> 14:09.211
(Footsteps approach)

14:09.245 --> 14:12.148
Mr. George,
Mr. elder's awake.

14:12.181 --> 14:13.649
Thank you.

14:13.683 --> 14:16.152
Everything is gonna be okay.

14:16.185 --> 14:18.487
I promise.

14:22.558 --> 14:24.794
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:24.827 --> 14:26.762
Where am I?

14:26.796 --> 14:28.631
You're at the imperial.

14:28.664 --> 14:31.133
(Sighs) Nicely played.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.768
Mm.

14:32.802 --> 14:35.271
How long have I been out?

14:35.304 --> 14:39.408
Long enough for me
to do a little research.

14:39.442 --> 14:43.079
Jeremy told me how you were
gonna fake your own death.

14:43.112 --> 14:45.147
Said you were planning
a getaway. Why?

14:45.181 --> 14:47.450
Why what, precisely?

14:47.483 --> 14:50.586
Why the need to disappear?
Why nola? Why her brother?

14:50.619 --> 14:53.756
Why the Darlings?
You can start wherever you like.

14:53.789 --> 14:56.292
Look, you don't want
to tell me,

14:56.325 --> 14:59.595
I'm sure the police
will listen.
Nick, I did--I told you,

14:59.628 --> 15:01.330
I'm not the bad guy here.

15:01.364 --> 15:04.333
Yeah, you keep
saying that, Simon.

15:04.367 --> 15:07.069
But you're not
telling me who is.

15:07.103 --> 15:09.538
All right.

15:09.572 --> 15:11.741
I'll tell you.

15:13.743 --> 15:15.211
(Man) Simon.

15:15.244 --> 15:17.780
Now what is
this new invention?

15:17.813 --> 15:20.082
It is a fuel.

15:20.116 --> 15:22.251
Just a seed of an idea
at this point,

15:22.284 --> 15:24.086
a prototype.
Ah.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.789
I am still seeking
economical means of production.

15:26.822 --> 15:29.492
But in the meantime,
here it is.

15:29.525 --> 15:31.060
(Child babbles)

15:31.093 --> 15:33.562
It is completely organic.

15:33.596 --> 15:36.599
Watch. Nontoxic.

15:36.632 --> 15:41.504
And it works in any traditional
internal combustion engine

15:41.537 --> 15:44.573
with a little
minor alteration.

15:46.242 --> 15:47.810
That is amazing.

15:47.843 --> 15:50.446
Yeah. Huh?
(Speaks foreign language)

15:50.479 --> 15:54.750
There she is--
my little girl.

15:54.784 --> 15:56.218
(Speaks foreign language)

15:56.252 --> 15:57.720
(Speaks foreign language)

15:57.753 --> 15:59.588
(Laughs)

16:01.490 --> 16:03.759
Hey, Justin.
What do you have there?

16:03.793 --> 16:06.395
Wow.

16:06.429 --> 16:09.265
Ni hao.
Ni hao.

16:09.298 --> 16:11.167
Nola, this is Simon,

16:11.200 --> 16:14.236
one of my old students
from moscow.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.472
Nola is an attorney
in New York.

16:16.505 --> 16:18.774
Just like you, Simon, she's
going straight to the top.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.776
Well, we'll see about that.
(Laughs)

16:20.810 --> 16:23.779
It's a shame your mother
did not live to see this day.

16:23.813 --> 16:27.316
Um, well, I've heard
a lot about you, Mr. elder.

16:27.349 --> 16:29.418
You're my father's star pupil.

16:29.452 --> 16:32.254
Oh, well, whatever he says,
don't believe him.

16:32.288 --> 16:34.457
This man is not
to be trusted. (Laughs)
(Laughs)

16:34.490 --> 16:37.259
(Laughs)
Um, excuse me.

16:38.494 --> 16:40.763
(Gasping)

16:40.796 --> 16:43.399
(Monitor beeping erratically)
(Nick) What's happening?

16:43.432 --> 16:45.401
(Strained voice)
I-I don't know.
Simon?

16:45.434 --> 16:47.336
Nick, get the doctor.
(Gasps) Please.
SIM--uh...

16:47.369 --> 16:49.038
What's going on?

16:49.071 --> 16:51.040
Uh, uh, he was fine,
he was talking,

16:51.073 --> 16:53.342
and then all of a sudden...
Get a syringe
and an oxygen bag.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.245
Doctor, what's going on?
His lung's collapsed.

16:56.278 --> 16:59.248
Well, how--how serious
is that?
Look, I need you to leave
and let me do my job

16:59.281 --> 17:02.118
or this man is gonna die.
(Gasping)

17:02.151 --> 17:06.088
(Monitor beeping erratically)

17:12.627 --> 17:14.597
(Jeremy) Look at you.

17:14.630 --> 17:16.098
Creepwad.

17:16.132 --> 17:20.102
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:20.136 --> 17:25.241
She should've killed you
when she had the chance.

17:25.273 --> 17:27.742
I wish she had.

17:27.776 --> 17:30.513
You could kill him
right now if you want.
What?

17:30.546 --> 17:33.082
He almost crashed
three hours ago.

17:33.115 --> 17:35.784
The doctor had to come in
and stabilize him.

17:35.818 --> 17:38.787
If he flatlined now...
No one would think twice.

17:38.821 --> 17:41.490
This is the morphine drip.

17:41.524 --> 17:43.058
All you do is this.

17:43.092 --> 17:45.060
What the hell are you doing?

17:45.094 --> 17:47.696
Give him five minutes,

17:47.730 --> 17:50.032
and he'll sink
like the "Titanic."

17:50.065 --> 17:53.035
Just stop it.
Stop that right now.
You said you hated him.

17:53.068 --> 17:55.671
Put that back.
All right. All right.
Are you happy?

17:55.704 --> 17:59.074
I can't believe
you just did that.
Look, it's okay.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.644
It's not morphine.
It's saline. It's harmless.

18:01.677 --> 18:05.114
I was joking. I'm sorry.
You seemed sad.

18:05.147 --> 18:10.019
You looked like you could
use a little entertainment.

18:10.052 --> 18:12.087
Well, um...

18:12.121 --> 18:14.056
Thanks.

18:14.089 --> 18:16.625
You're welcome.

18:16.659 --> 18:20.629
And... if you want
some more entertainment later,

18:20.663 --> 18:22.998
my shift ends at 10:00.

18:30.406 --> 18:32.374
(Patrick)
I like his more mature works,

18:32.408 --> 18:34.076
when you get the feeling

18:34.109 --> 18:36.078
he wasn't trying
to impress anybody anymore.

18:36.111 --> 18:38.080
He was just doing it
for himself.

18:38.113 --> 18:40.082
You really know
your stuff, pat.

18:40.115 --> 18:41.383
I know what I like.

18:41.417 --> 18:44.053
The nice thing about
growing up with money

18:44.086 --> 18:46.055
is you get to
spend your life

18:46.088 --> 18:48.591
around a lot
of beautiful things.

18:48.624 --> 18:51.093
Thanks for coming out
like this.

18:51.126 --> 18:54.163
I'm glad I did.

18:58.801 --> 19:00.803
(Tripp) It's not good.

19:00.836 --> 19:02.805
Someone from the publishers

19:02.838 --> 19:06.075
of Lisa's upcoming exposé

19:06.108 --> 19:07.776
has leaked a bit

19:07.810 --> 19:10.279
of her quote/unquote
"insider" content.

19:10.312 --> 19:12.147
Which includes what
exactly?

19:12.181 --> 19:14.283
Details
of Patrick's marriage,

19:14.316 --> 19:16.151
his affair,

19:16.185 --> 19:18.120
Letitia's trial,

19:18.153 --> 19:20.356
her payment of money
to your mother,

19:20.389 --> 19:22.424
Karen and Simon.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.093
I know.

19:24.126 --> 19:26.462
It's... very disappointing,

19:26.495 --> 19:28.597
but I'd like you
to get hold

19:28.631 --> 19:30.599
of the family's
public relations person,

19:30.633 --> 19:32.668
Rebecca colfax--

19:32.701 --> 19:35.104
no, Tripp.
I'll handle it.
No, Nick.

19:35.137 --> 19:38.107
This is not press releases
and newspaper interviews.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.109
We're gonna need people
on television.

19:40.142 --> 19:42.111
Even so, I think
it's best if I handle it.

19:42.144 --> 19:45.114
I want that book neutralized,
but I don't want Lisa attacked.

19:45.147 --> 19:47.116
So I'll do it.

19:48.817 --> 19:50.252
Okay.

19:50.286 --> 19:52.254
(Cell phone rings)

19:52.288 --> 19:53.255
(Beep)

19:53.289 --> 19:55.024
Nick George.

19:55.057 --> 19:57.226
I'll be right there.

19:57.259 --> 19:58.560
(Beep)

19:58.594 --> 20:01.030
He's awake.

20:02.798 --> 20:05.167
You okay now?

20:05.200 --> 20:08.604
Aww. Nick George cares.

20:08.637 --> 20:10.706
(Chuckles)
The only reason I care

20:10.739 --> 20:13.509
is because you have
a story to finish.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.778
Nola's father had just
shown you his prototype

20:15.811 --> 20:18.681
for the bio-fuel
you claim to have invented.
Right.

20:18.714 --> 20:21.183
So how did you wind up
taking the credit

20:21.216 --> 20:22.651
and the money for that?

20:22.685 --> 20:26.088
Well... Shien's luck

20:26.121 --> 20:29.425
took a bad turn.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.061
(Chuckles)
You must be very proud.

20:32.094 --> 20:34.363
I am,
but even more so, Simon,

20:34.396 --> 20:37.666
I think with your prominence
in the world marketplace

20:37.700 --> 20:39.535
and my invention...

20:39.568 --> 20:41.770
What are you saying?

20:41.804 --> 20:45.140
If you are ready to sign,

20:45.174 --> 20:50.012
I am ready to share
this with you... 50-50.

20:53.148 --> 20:55.517
That sounds like
a risk worth taking.

20:55.551 --> 20:57.753
(Laughs)

20:57.786 --> 21:00.155
(Speaking foreign language)

21:00.189 --> 21:03.092
(Speaking foreign language)
What's going on here?

21:10.632 --> 21:13.235
Simon, I don't know
what this is about,

21:13.268 --> 21:16.105
but you have to help me.
No, I'm sure this is
a misunderstanding.

21:16.138 --> 21:18.374
We'll figure it out.
(Speaks foreign language)

21:18.407 --> 21:22.144
Go to my son, please.
See if he's okay, please.
I will. Don't worry.

21:22.177 --> 21:24.613
I'll take care
of everything.
(Speaks foreign language)

21:24.646 --> 21:28.050
(Men shouting
in foreign language)

21:30.786 --> 21:32.621
(Door closes)

21:34.623 --> 21:38.026
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)
(Nick) So you set him up

21:38.060 --> 21:40.062
and conveniently forgot
to mention him ever again.

21:40.095 --> 21:43.065
Look, Nick, if I had to
do it all over again,

21:43.098 --> 21:45.567
I would've left those vials
on the table

21:45.601 --> 21:47.035
and never looked back.

21:47.069 --> 21:50.072
That is where
all my trouble began.

21:50.105 --> 21:52.708
What does that mean?

21:52.741 --> 21:55.711
(Woman) So you could give him
his last dose of antibiotics

21:55.744 --> 21:58.046
in 40 minutes.
Okay.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.450
Excuse us. We need to
give Mr. elder his bath.

22:01.483 --> 22:03.152
We'll finish this later.

22:03.185 --> 22:06.088
(Laughs) Hey.
You know where to find me.

22:18.834 --> 22:22.471
(Footsteps approach)

22:22.504 --> 22:25.174
Alcohol is a depressant,
chief.

22:25.207 --> 22:27.176
Step away from the bottle.

22:27.209 --> 22:30.179
(Scoffs) Is that
your professional opinion?

22:30.212 --> 22:32.414
Nope. It's personal...

22:32.448 --> 22:35.717
Empirical and anecdotal...

22:35.751 --> 22:39.021
Gathered from my many years
of hard living.

22:39.054 --> 22:41.223
You need
a change of scenery.

22:41.256 --> 22:43.325
(Scoffs) I wouldn't know
where to go.

22:45.394 --> 22:49.498
I used to, back when I was
Jeremy Darling.

22:49.531 --> 22:51.500
But then my mother
got arrested for murder,

22:51.533 --> 22:53.802
and everything went to hell.

22:53.836 --> 22:55.671
I fell in love...

22:55.704 --> 22:59.408
Hit my head,
faked amnesia...

22:59.441 --> 23:01.510
Here I am.

23:01.543 --> 23:04.079
Drinking your way back
to amnesia.

23:04.112 --> 23:06.281
I'll call you
when I get there.

23:11.153 --> 23:13.088

Okay, get in. That's--

You and me, together.

Yes. It's just, when I--

24:17.052 --> 24:19.521
when I think about
all the surprises we've gotten

24:19.555 --> 24:21.757
from all the people
we thought we knew...
Like your ex?

24:21.790 --> 24:25.093
And yours.
Oh. We can pick 'em,
can't we?

24:25.127 --> 24:27.796
Yeah, we sure can.

24:27.829 --> 24:31.266

about each other...
Oh.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.136
The good, the bad, the ugly.

And I'm not just okay...
With who you are,

24:39.775 --> 24:42.411
I love who you are.

24:42.444 --> 24:45.747
It's just, from the first day
that I saw you...

24:47.382 --> 24:50.085
In your little orange,
one-piece bathing suit

24:50.118 --> 24:53.221
and your bucket of frogs
and your shovel...

24:53.255 --> 24:55.791
(Sighs) Oh, man.

24:55.824 --> 24:58.760
I just knew
you were the girl for me.

24:58.794 --> 25:02.030
Mm. I loved
that one-piece bathing suit.

25:02.064 --> 25:03.031
Yeah.

25:03.065 --> 25:04.032
Yeah.

25:04.066 --> 25:05.033
Yeah.

25:05.067 --> 25:06.168
Hmm.

25:06.201 --> 25:08.503
So...

25:08.537 --> 25:11.073
You and me, what--
what do you think?

25:11.106 --> 25:13.809
Oh. I think it's about time.

25:25.153 --> 25:28.123
(Drill whirring)

25:28.156 --> 25:31.126

25:34.229 --> 25:35.197
Brian!

25:35.230 --> 25:37.132
(Brian) I'm in the bathroom!

25:37.165 --> 25:38.634
(Pounding continues)

25:38.667 --> 25:41.637
Or--or what... has, uh,
historically been

25:41.670 --> 25:45.040
the bathroom.

25:45.073 --> 25:47.643
What is it now?

25:47.676 --> 25:50.512
It's gonna be a sauna.
A sauna?

25:50.545 --> 25:53.148
Yeah, the kitchen's
gonna become the bathroom,

25:53.181 --> 25:58.053
and, uh, Kiki's room's
gonna become the kitchen.

25:58.086 --> 26:01.023
Are you insane?

26:01.056 --> 26:03.358
No, no. Uh, Kiki's gonna sleep
in this little loft

26:03.392 --> 26:05.360
that we're gonna build
above the wine locker.

26:05.394 --> 26:08.530
Who said you could do this?
No, look--listen.

26:08.563 --> 26:11.099
Look...

26:11.133 --> 26:13.101
If the landlord's
got a problem with it,

26:13.135 --> 26:14.536
we just buy the building.

26:14.569 --> 26:16.538
No, I'm the one with
the problem, Brian, me.

26:16.571 --> 26:18.173
Yeah, obviously.

26:18.206 --> 26:19.708
Hey. (Exhales deeply)

26:19.741 --> 26:21.810
You're my guest.

26:21.843 --> 26:24.513
So why don't you just be
a gracious host

26:24.546 --> 26:26.081
and make way?

26:26.114 --> 26:28.784
I mean, come on,
we're both miserable here.

26:28.817 --> 26:32.320
I'm just trying
to do something about it.
Put it all back.

26:32.354 --> 26:35.590
(Pounding)

26:35.624 --> 26:36.725
Now.

26:36.758 --> 26:39.027
(Door closes)

26:45.233 --> 26:47.536
A moment of your time,
senator?

26:47.569 --> 26:50.072
What can I do for you,
congressman?

26:50.105 --> 26:52.774
This has gotta stop...
Right now.

26:52.808 --> 26:54.776
Your little affair
with my wife.

26:54.810 --> 26:57.112
Do you understand me,
senator?

26:57.145 --> 26:59.681
I'm still trying
to get over the fact

26:59.715 --> 27:01.717
that you followed us
to the gallery.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.086
How did you know?

27:04.119 --> 27:07.222
Called your office.
Told 'em it was urgent.

27:10.425 --> 27:13.228
Am I, uh,
missing something here?

27:13.261 --> 27:15.230
We had a deal.
The deal was simple.

27:15.263 --> 27:18.200
You're supposed to have sex
with my wife and only sex.

27:18.233 --> 27:20.635
But from what I saw,
the two of you

27:20.669 --> 27:23.105
seem to have feelings
for one another--both of you.

27:23.138 --> 27:25.107
And I'll not stand for that.

27:25.140 --> 27:28.110
Well, you may
very well have to,

27:28.143 --> 27:29.411
because I like her,

27:29.444 --> 27:31.079
and you, my friend,

27:31.113 --> 27:33.248
are... gay.

27:33.281 --> 27:34.716
(Chuckles)

27:34.750 --> 27:37.552
I mean, it's not like
you can call this a marriage.

27:37.586 --> 27:40.589
No, stop it. Stop it
right now. Don't go there.

27:40.622 --> 27:44.025
Instead, why don't you
take a look at that?

27:45.427 --> 27:47.129
Go on.

27:56.238 --> 28:00.108
Dana and... me
at the hotel.

28:00.142 --> 28:02.110
It's a little
insurance policy, senator.

28:02.144 --> 28:05.113
You see, whenever my wife
gets together with someone

28:05.147 --> 28:06.782
to have her needs met,

28:06.815 --> 28:08.784
I take a couple of pictures,

28:08.817 --> 28:11.520
make sure things
don't get out of hand,

28:11.553 --> 28:15.023
because men have a tendency,
a nasty, nasty tendency,

28:15.056 --> 28:16.324
to fall for her.

28:16.358 --> 28:19.427
(Sighs) What do you...
What do you want, Charles?

28:19.461 --> 28:23.064
I want you to stay away
from my wife.

28:23.098 --> 28:25.200
I offered you friendship,
Patrick,

28:25.233 --> 28:27.202
I offered you--
how can I put this--

28:27.235 --> 28:29.037
unprecedented access,

28:29.070 --> 28:34.142
but you... (Chuckles)
You got hungry.

28:34.176 --> 28:38.046
And you forgot your manners.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.550
It's over, senator.

Please welcome
Mr. Nick George,

28:52.694 --> 28:55.230
personal legal counsel
to the Darling family.

28:55.263 --> 28:58.400
Nice to have you with us,
Mr. George.
Thanks for having me.

28:58.433 --> 29:01.603
First, tell us,
do the leaks coming out

29:01.636 --> 29:04.105
about the, uh, Darling tell-all
contain any truth?

29:04.139 --> 29:06.208
I mean, are the Darlings
as out of control

29:06.241 --> 29:08.376
as we've heard?
No, no. Of course not.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.645
They--it may be
hard to believe,

29:10.679 --> 29:13.248
but they're really a family
like any other,

29:13.281 --> 29:16.184
using the resources they have
to try to enjoy life,

29:16.218 --> 29:20.021
make the world
a better place.
So the author's claims that,
uh, there is trouble in--

29:20.055 --> 29:22.424
well, before we grace
the author's claims

29:22.457 --> 29:24.426
with any attention,
let's consider that

29:24.459 --> 29:26.061
the author's motivation
included

29:26.094 --> 29:28.630
a 6-figure cash advance
to peddle this trash.

29:28.663 --> 29:32.033
All right, now the author--
you mean your ex-wife.
Yes, that's--
that's correct, Bob.

29:32.067 --> 29:34.035
But I'm not really interested
in pursuing

29:34.069 --> 29:36.805
that particular thread
of the story.
Well, you might not be,

29:36.838 --> 29:39.808
but the people of New York
are very interested in the way

29:39.841 --> 29:43.078
that your family drama
has turned into tabloid fodder,

29:43.111 --> 29:45.447
which is why we have
a surprise guest today...

29:45.480 --> 29:48.383
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute--
someone who is ready to share

29:48.416 --> 29:51.286

30:16.177 --> 30:18.146
Now before we went to break,

30:18.179 --> 30:21.082
there was a point you wanted
to clear up, Mr. George.

30:21.116 --> 30:23.084
Yes, I just wanted
to remind your audience that

30:23.118 --> 30:26.688
despite Lisa's accusations,
the Darlings, as a family,

30:26.721 --> 30:29.291
have done an enormous amount
of good for this country.

30:29.324 --> 30:32.794
They're not perfect. They're
human, just like you and me.

30:32.827 --> 30:35.063
Not exactly like you and me.

30:35.096 --> 30:37.632
I mean, most people don't find
ourselves so entitled as to

30:37.666 --> 30:41.069
run for public office while
blatantly cheating on our wives

30:41.102 --> 30:43.538
or throwing parties that
close down the Brooklyn bridge.

30:43.571 --> 30:46.241
Well, that was a charity event,
for your information,

30:46.274 --> 30:48.643
the proceeds of which
exceeded over $2 million.

30:48.677 --> 30:51.479
Charity event?
It was a birthday party.

30:51.513 --> 30:53.381
And I'm sure
that the commuters

30:53.415 --> 30:56.084
trying to get home
to their families that night

30:56.117 --> 30:58.253
were very impressed.
Yeah, you know, isn't this
a little hypocritical,

30:58.286 --> 31:00.488
seeing as how you have
a business relationship

31:00.522 --> 31:02.590
with one of the Darlings?

31:02.624 --> 31:04.759
Jeremy Darling is an investor
in her art gallery.

31:04.793 --> 31:07.529
I bought him out
when I got my advance,

31:07.562 --> 31:09.531
but while we're on the subject
of credibility...
Yes.

31:09.564 --> 31:11.800
Don't you think
it's a little difficult

31:11.833 --> 31:14.302
to trust a man defending
the Darlings when he's in fact

31:14.336 --> 31:16.204
in love with one of them?

31:16.237 --> 31:19.374
I forgot to mention that Nick
is currently in a relationship

31:19.407 --> 31:22.477
with Karen Darling.
Really? What a tangled web.

I know!
Don't worry, I won't give out
the sordid details now,

31:25.246 --> 31:28.683
but it will all
be in the book.
All right.
Hold it right there.

31:28.717 --> 31:31.052

So... you stole the bio-fuel
from Nola’s father,

32:57.105 --> 32:59.441
and then what?

32:59.474 --> 33:01.042
He was arrested?

33:01.076 --> 33:02.710
Arrested for what?

33:02.744 --> 33:04.679
Your father's being charged
with sedition--

33:04.712 --> 33:06.748
some editorial he wrote

33:06.781 --> 33:08.750
in which he denounced
the Chinese government

33:08.783 --> 33:11.719
or appeared to do so.
I never heard a thing
about that.

33:11.753 --> 33:14.022
Yeah, well, I don't have
all the details right now,

33:14.055 --> 33:16.758
and they're unimportant
at this point.
Where is my brother?

33:16.791 --> 33:19.494
I have him.
What do you mean,
you have him?

33:19.527 --> 33:22.797
I took him to a safe place.
Where?

33:22.831 --> 33:25.100
Listen, you're gonna
have to trust me.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.736
From now on, I will be
the gateway for all contact

33:28.770 --> 33:31.039
between you and your brother.

33:31.072 --> 33:33.508
And in exchange for--
for his safety,

33:33.541 --> 33:36.811
I'll get your help,
your cooperation.

33:36.845 --> 33:40.582
You're holding him hostage.

33:40.615 --> 33:43.017
Since you've become
assistant D. A.,

33:43.051 --> 33:46.087
you're in a unique position
to help me in ways...

33:46.121 --> 33:47.388
I can't help myself.

33:47.422 --> 33:50.425
Now by the way, if you
tell anyone about this,

33:50.458 --> 33:52.494
you'll never see him again.

33:52.527 --> 33:55.630
That means no police, no private
investigators, nothing.

33:55.663 --> 33:59.134
Do you understand that?
But if you cooperate...

33:59.167 --> 34:01.503
I'll get your father
released from prison.

34:01.536 --> 34:03.338
And in time...

34:03.371 --> 34:04.806
You'll see your brother.

34:04.839 --> 34:07.308
So that's how you forced nola

34:07.342 --> 34:10.311
to prosecute Letitia Darling
for a crime she didn't commit?

34:10.344 --> 34:12.547
Essentially.
Why?

34:12.580 --> 34:14.081
(Knock on door)

34:14.114 --> 34:15.250
Come.

34:15.283 --> 34:16.751
Hi.

34:16.784 --> 34:19.219
Nick, can we talk
for a minute, please?

34:19.254 --> 34:21.755
Please go ahead.

34:21.789 --> 34:25.126
We're not done here.
I'm well aware.

34:32.567 --> 34:35.503
Lisa, what are you doing here?
Is Kiki all right?

34:35.536 --> 34:38.540
Kiki's fine. It's about us.
Well, I don't want
to talk about us.

34:38.572 --> 34:41.074
There's no us anymore
to talk about.
Nick,
please just listen to me.

34:41.109 --> 34:43.478
I couldn't believe
what that turned into

34:43.511 --> 34:45.179
today at the studio.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.549
Well, Lisa,
you made that happen.

34:47.581 --> 34:51.052
You made the book deal. You
agreed to appear on the show.

34:51.085 --> 34:53.621
It's--don't get dainty
this late in the game.
You know me.

34:53.655 --> 34:55.790
That's not who I was
when we met.

34:55.822 --> 34:57.792
It's not who I want to be.

34:57.825 --> 34:59.494
Well, then stop being it.

34:59.527 --> 35:01.563
Start taking
some responsibility

35:01.596 --> 35:03.398
for what happened between us.

35:03.431 --> 35:05.266
I am.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.601
Lisa--

35:06.634 --> 35:08.570
I am going to.

35:08.603 --> 35:11.105
Nick... we can do this.

35:11.139 --> 35:13.741
We can start over.
We can do this together.
Lisa--

35:13.775 --> 35:15.743
don't you think
it's worth a try,

35:15.777 --> 35:18.580
for Kiki if nothing else?

35:18.613 --> 35:20.381
Lisa...

35:22.250 --> 35:24.118
It's too late.

35:24.152 --> 35:25.753
Don't say that.

35:25.787 --> 35:27.522
It is, Lisa. I'm sorry.

35:27.555 --> 35:31.125
Just... think about it.

35:31.159 --> 35:34.562
(Voice breaking)
Think about what we had

35:34.596 --> 35:36.231
before the Darlings.

35:36.264 --> 35:40.468
We had such a good thing.

35:40.501 --> 35:42.770
I know.

35:42.804 --> 35:46.140
Just... go back there.

35:46.174 --> 35:49.310
For one minute, go back.

35:49.344 --> 35:51.112
Lise. Lise--

35:51.145 --> 35:52.146
oh!

35:52.180 --> 35:53.715
Oh. Oh!
Karen.

35:53.748 --> 35:56.050
No, no, no. I--you're--
Karen, wait a minute.

35:56.084 --> 35:58.086
You're obviously
in the middle

35:58.119 --> 36:00.188
of something
very complicated right now,

36:00.221 --> 36:02.357
and so--
it's not complicated.
Karen, you don't understand.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.459
I don't need to understand,
Nick. That's the fun part.

36:04.492 --> 36:07.428
I just don't need
to understand.
Karen!

36:11.165 --> 36:12.800
Karen. Karen.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.802
Karen. Somebody get a doctor!

36:21.542 --> 36:23.111
(Siren wails)

36:23.144 --> 36:26.147
(Woman speaking indistinctly
over P. A.)

36:28.816 --> 36:30.118
Hey.

36:30.151 --> 36:33.021
Hey.

36:33.054 --> 36:35.023
How you feelin'?

36:35.056 --> 36:36.758
A little empty.

36:36.791 --> 36:39.260
But aside from that, I'm...

36:39.294 --> 36:40.795
Right as rain.

36:40.828 --> 36:42.764
I'm sorry.

36:42.797 --> 36:45.133
It's not your fault.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.801
I should've looked
where I was going,

36:46.834 --> 36:49.170
you know, in general.

36:49.203 --> 36:50.772
Well, just so you know,

36:50.805 --> 36:54.142
the doctor said
you can try again soon...

36:54.175 --> 36:56.144
To get pregnant,
if you want to.

36:56.177 --> 36:58.146
If I want to?

36:58.179 --> 37:01.516
I will--I guess I'll have to
see how I feel about that.

37:01.549 --> 37:03.084
I'd be willing to try.

37:03.117 --> 37:05.353
With Lisa?

37:05.386 --> 37:08.690
No, with you
when you're ready.

37:08.723 --> 37:11.125
And how does Lisa feel
about that?

37:11.159 --> 37:14.195
It doesn't matter.

37:14.228 --> 37:17.231
Look, Karen, she's always
gonna be Kiki's mom,

37:17.265 --> 37:21.035
she's always gonna be
in my life, but...

37:21.069 --> 37:23.104
I want to be with you.

37:23.137 --> 37:25.139
For keeps?
For keeps.

37:25.173 --> 37:27.041
Mm.

37:27.075 --> 37:28.710
Wow.

37:30.078 --> 37:33.114
Our long national nightmare
is over.

37:43.424 --> 37:45.660
Why did you call?

37:45.693 --> 37:48.096
I thought you already
spoke with Charles.

37:49.731 --> 37:51.366
Do you love him, Dana?

37:51.399 --> 37:53.334
(Chuckles)

37:53.368 --> 37:55.536
Just tell me, Dana,
do you love him?

37:55.570 --> 37:58.106
He's my husband.
We have an arrangement.

37:58.139 --> 38:01.175
It's been working.
But when I asked you
to come here behind his back,

38:01.209 --> 38:03.311
you said yes,
so what's the truth?

38:03.344 --> 38:04.445
Patrick...

38:04.479 --> 38:06.447
Look, I need to know
if you think

38:06.481 --> 38:10.485
that there's a chance...
That you and I could...

38:10.518 --> 38:12.353
Ever have something real.

38:15.490 --> 38:17.091
More than just sex?

38:19.260 --> 38:22.430
More than just sex.

38:22.463 --> 38:25.666
(Sighs) Yes.

38:25.700 --> 38:28.102
That's all I need to know.

38:28.136 --> 38:30.104
Uh, Patrick, what are you
going to do?

38:30.138 --> 38:32.774
You know,
Charles can be dangerous.

38:32.807 --> 38:36.144
Don't underestimate him.
Don't underestimate me.

38:36.177 --> 38:39.313
You deserve to be with a man
who wants you...

38:39.347 --> 38:40.815
All of you.

38:40.848 --> 38:43.217
This little arrangement
the two of you had

38:43.251 --> 38:45.219
might have worked for a while,

38:45.253 --> 38:48.222
but I'm gonna make sure that
he understands one thing--

38:48.256 --> 38:51.125
that there's gonna be
a new arrangement.

38:58.366 --> 39:00.735
Jeremy!

39:00.768 --> 39:03.037
Nola. What are you
doing here?

39:03.070 --> 39:04.038
Hi.

39:04.071 --> 39:05.540
Mm.

39:05.573 --> 39:07.542
I found my brother
in lausanne,

39:07.575 --> 39:09.777
and then my father took him
back to Shanghai with him,

39:09.811 --> 39:12.380
and I just...
Yeah?

39:12.413 --> 39:15.583
I love you, and I don't
want to be without you.

39:15.616 --> 39:17.051
I can't.

39:17.084 --> 39:18.553
Mm. Mm. Okay.

39:18.586 --> 39:20.755
Um, this is, uh,

39:20.788 --> 39:23.024
this is--this is interesting.

39:23.057 --> 39:26.160
Listen...
I want to marry you.

39:26.194 --> 39:29.497
I am ready to become...

39:29.530 --> 39:31.399
Mrs. Jeremy Darling.

39:31.432 --> 39:32.400
(Laughs)

39:32.433 --> 39:35.670
Mm. Mm.

39:35.703 --> 39:40.141
Um, there--there's just
one... small...

39:40.174 --> 39:41.609
Very, very small problem.

39:41.642 --> 39:42.777
Mm-hmm.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.145
Yeah?

39:44.178 --> 39:46.080
I kinda already got married.

39:46.113 --> 39:48.783
He's a great catch,
isn't he?

39:53.087 --> 39:56.757
Are you serious?

40:02.730 --> 40:05.566
Hey. Welcome home.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.702
Hey.

40:07.735 --> 40:10.404
Well, I see everything
is back to normal.

40:10.438 --> 40:13.207
Before you get your boxers
in a twist,

40:13.241 --> 40:16.043
just give it a second.

40:16.077 --> 40:19.313
That's a rug.
People walk on it.

40:19.347 --> 40:20.648
Really?

40:24.051 --> 40:25.786
What's all that?

40:25.820 --> 40:28.523
It's gold leaf.

40:32.126 --> 40:33.761
It's nice.

40:33.794 --> 40:37.698
Did you have a rough day?

40:37.732 --> 40:40.067
You have no idea.

40:40.101 --> 40:42.136
Well, then...

40:42.169 --> 40:45.072
What the hell
is that thing?

40:45.106 --> 40:47.742
It's an Italian
wine dispensing system

40:47.775 --> 40:49.810
for drunks.

40:49.844 --> 40:52.113
Fancy.

40:54.415 --> 40:56.584
A little change is good,
huh?

40:56.617 --> 40:59.387
It's not entirely bad.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.290
Thanks.

41:02.323 --> 41:03.791
(Glasses clink)

41:03.824 --> 41:06.093
Don't thank me.

41:06.127 --> 41:07.595
Thank Letitia.

41:07.628 --> 41:09.297
Letitia?

41:09.330 --> 41:12.400
Yeah, this was all her idea.

41:12.433 --> 41:15.670
Letitia.

41:17.071 --> 41:19.574
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

41:19.607 --> 41:23.144
Wake up.

41:23.177 --> 41:24.645
What's going on?

41:24.679 --> 41:28.149
There's still one question
you haven't answered.

41:28.182 --> 41:30.117
(Scoffs) What?

41:30.151 --> 41:33.120
Of all the things that you
forced nola to do,

41:33.154 --> 41:36.023
why did you have her
prosecute Letitia?

41:36.057 --> 41:38.426
If you wanted to take down
the Darlings,

41:38.459 --> 41:40.728
Tripp would've been
a much more effective target.

41:40.761 --> 41:42.730
Yeah, that's exactly
what I thought.

41:42.763 --> 41:44.732
(Sighs) Nick,
I keep telling you,

41:44.765 --> 41:46.801
I'm not the bad guy.

41:46.834 --> 41:49.804
You've confessed to kidnapping,
extortion, conspiracy to murder.

41:49.837 --> 41:52.540
How are you not the bad guy?

41:52.573 --> 41:55.643
(Sighs)

41:55.676 --> 41:58.312
Your father...

41:58.346 --> 42:00.781
Digging up dirt on me
for Tripp,

42:00.815 --> 42:04.352
found out I stole
the bio-fuel...

42:04.385 --> 42:06.354
Among other things.

42:06.387 --> 42:10.725
He never stopped holding that
over my head.

42:10.758 --> 42:15.663
He was the one who wanted me
to punish Letitia.

42:15.696 --> 42:18.265
But why?

42:18.299 --> 42:21.268
By the time Letitia
had been arrested, he was--

42:21.302 --> 42:23.604
dead?

42:23.638 --> 42:26.107
Afraid not.

42:26.140 --> 42:28.376
What are you saying?

42:30.444 --> 42:32.279
That my father is alive?

42:32.313 --> 42:33.781
Alive...

42:33.814 --> 42:37.585
And well...

42:37.618 --> 42:39.758
And still one hell
of a bastard.
