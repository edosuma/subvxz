I'll see you later.

Now we're hosed!

Not yet! I've got a plan!

10:07.232 --> 10:08.525
Can you stall 'em, Fyootch?

Sorry I got upset
that you wanted to stay here.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.216
I should have gone
with you, man.

to be totally boring.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.387

that the bosses shot down

11:51.920 --> 11:52.963
my latest pitch.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.340
I thought people who play
solitaire might be lonely,

11:55.424 --> 11:57.217
so they could use
a solitaire-playing robot

-That's genius!

But the bosses thought
"Soli-Terry"

12:02.598 --> 12:04.892
was a "soli-terry-ible" idea.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.395
You oughta throw some

12:08.478 --> 12:09.521
Then it'll sell itself.

No way. Fine, let's ask
everybody we know!

19:08.982 --> 19:11.568
Well, if I'm right, you gotta
kiss a real pig on the lips.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.028
Oh, yeah!

19:13.111 --> 19:14.947
And If I'm right,
you have to kiss a fish.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.114
On the butt!

19:16.198 --> 19:17.366
Deal.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.975
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Fish, fish, fish!

19:44.601 --> 19:46.770
(FUTURE-WORM WHISTLES)
Hey, everybody, it's pig time!

19:46.937 --> 19:50.023
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Pig, pig, pig!

19:50.107 --> 19:52.317
Fish, pig, fish, pig!

19:52.484 --> 19:57.114
Okay. 377 to 377.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.657
A tie? What now?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.701
There's only one
way to settle this.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.995
Go so far into the future
we reach the end of time

20:03.078 --> 20:05.414
where all information has
collapsed into a singularity?

20:05.497 --> 20:06.540
You know it.

20:11.211 --> 20:15.215
O wise and all-knowing
End of Time, reveal thyself!

20:15.299 --> 20:17.259
We come seeking your wisdom.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.600
We have a question.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.103
Sure. You guys wanna
chill here a while?

20:28.187 --> 20:30.564
I was about to make
a vegan grilled cheese sandie.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.941
You want one?
They're delicious.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.652
Mmm-mmm.
You don't even miss the dairy.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.487
These are truly the pinnacle
of yumminess,

20:37.571 --> 20:38.697
O great End of Time.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.866
So, back to our question.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.659
Yeah, dude.
Is this is a fish or a pig?

20:42.743 --> 20:44.536
Hey, man,
it's an optical illusion.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.830
Like, ambiguity
is the whole point.

20:46.914 --> 20:49.374
It's what you wanna see, man.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.627
Mmm, I want to see
more of these sandwiches.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.504
What? But it can't be both!

20:53.587 --> 20:55.047
(GROANS)

20:56.340 --> 20:58.258
(SQUEALING)

20:58.342 --> 21:01.094
Uh, okay,
Your Majesty, or whatever.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.554
You gotta pick
one or the other.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.932
Whatever, man.
This is stupid anyway.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.227
Fine, it's a...
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)

21:08.310 --> 21:09.436
It's a pig.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.313
-Aw, man.
-Boo-ya!

21:11.396 --> 21:13.315
Straight from the End of Time!

21:13.398 --> 21:16.026
Hey, End of Time.
Conjure up a pig, please.

21:16.944 --> 21:19.071
-(SNORTS)
-Pucker up.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.698
(GROANING)

21:23.784 --> 21:24.868
(CHUCKLES) Nice.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.208
Oh, snap, y'all.

21:31.625 --> 21:34.002
Now that I look at it,
it's a fish.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.255
-What? But you said...
-Too late!
