Come here.

You can see the Water

the back fence.

01:19.546 --> 01:22.081

Oh, well.
I mean, sure.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.932
He was playing Superman.

Four hours.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.249
What is four hours?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.251
Look, they gotta scrub up,

02:32.252 --> 02:33.752
that takes a couple
of hours right there.

02:33.753 --> 02:36.255
And then this thing
is exploratory,

02:36.256 --> 02:37.689
and exploratory takes more time

02:37.690 --> 02:40.626
because they don't have a real
destination they're going for,

to the other, but...

10:40.139 --> 10:41.139
the leader of a great nation,

10:41.140 --> 10:42.641
to be standing in the shower,

10:42.642 --> 10:47.078
and there at my feet,
it looks like a hamster drowned.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.580
I tell you, I hate that
more than anything.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.082
That, and communism.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.586
El, you are so handsome
when you're like this.

10:58.591 --> 11:04.095
You look...
very nice tonight.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.096
So do you.

11:05.097 --> 11:08.099
You know, I really
have to get to bed.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.100
Excuse me.
Goodnight.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.503
Please, don't go.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.938
Well, I have to leave.

11:13.939 --> 11:14.939
I feel...

11:14.940 --> 11:15.940
I feel funny.

11:15.941 --> 11:18.943
El, what do you mean?

11:18.944 --> 11:20.945
You know, it's like

11:20.946 --> 11:23.948
somebody is pouring seltzer
into my shorts.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.450
Good night.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.420
Don't you want
to kiss me good night?

11:28.421 --> 11:32.590
Oh, yes, Jess.

11:32.591 --> 11:36.361
I would love
to kiss you goodnight.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.364
And then I would like
to kiss you good morning,

11:39.365 --> 11:41.766
and good night again.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.068
As a matter of fact,
one long kiss,

11:43.069 --> 11:46.905
thirteen hours...
That would be nice.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.909
Well, then, why don't you.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.911
No, no, no...

11:53.412 --> 11:54.913
Kissing leads to necking,

11:54.914 --> 11:56.414
and necking leads
to more necking,

11:56.415 --> 11:58.917
and more necking leads to
screaming and rolling around...

11:58.918 --> 12:00.919
No, no, no, no.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.922
Don't you find me attractive?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.323
Are you kidding?

12:05.324 --> 12:09.327
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

12:09.328 --> 12:10.829
It's my principles.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.331
You have principles.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.835
I gave them the night off.

12:16.836 --> 12:20.839
No, Saunders would look at me
funny in the morning.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.241
I gave him the night off too.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.778
You see, in my country,
Malaguay, we always had...

12:26.779 --> 12:30.782
How you say in English?
<i>Chaperones.</i>

12:30.783 --> 12:32.784
So, if anyone started to feel
a little peppy,

12:32.785 --> 12:34.285
you know, the chaperon
would come in

12:34.286 --> 12:35.787
and give a stern warning,

12:35.788 --> 12:37.288
maybe break a few fingers and...

12:37.289 --> 12:40.291
Oh, El, this is worse
than high school.

12:40.292 --> 12:44.295
You know, in high school,
we did everything but.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.797
Now we're not doing anything,

12:45.798 --> 12:46.798
and I feel worse than if we were

12:46.799 --> 12:50.301
doing everything
but "but."

12:50.302 --> 12:53.304
However, if we skipped
"everything"

12:53.305 --> 12:55.807
and went straight to "but,"

12:55.808 --> 12:58.309
then, you see, we could go back

12:58.310 --> 13:01.312
and do everything
leading up to "but."

13:01.313 --> 13:03.815
Which, of course, would also
give us something to do later,

13:03.816 --> 13:06.752
since neither of us smoke.

13:11.123 --> 13:15.627
But we are not married, you see.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.629
Jessica, I promise you,
after we are married...

13:17.630 --> 13:21.032
El, I'm not sure
I want to be married again.

13:21.033 --> 13:25.036
I'm still trying
to get used to being single.

13:25.037 --> 13:27.472
Do you understand?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.440
Jess, I love you.

13:29.441 --> 13:32.877
And I love you.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.779
And I also want you.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.282
So?

13:37.283 --> 13:42.787
So you won't think me a swine
if I ask you one favor?

13:42.788 --> 13:45.757
Ask away.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.260
Will you close your eyes
for me, please?

13:54.767 --> 13:56.268

You okay?

Am I okay?

14:26.432 --> 14:29.334
Of course I am, thanks to you.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.137
Now, you're not supposed
to talk a lot.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.640
Are they treating you okay?

14:35.641 --> 14:38.476
Never mind, don't answer.

14:38.477 --> 14:41.679
Is there anything
you'd like me to bring you?

14:41.680 --> 14:44.549
No, don't answer.
I'll think of something.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.719
I'm sorry
I got you into all this.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.287
Oh, yeah.

14:49.288 --> 14:53.725
You got a lot to apologize for,
like saving my life.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.194
That'd be enough
to make me fall in love with you

14:56.195 --> 14:58.329
if I wasn't
in love with you already.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.131
You love me?

15:00.132 --> 15:03.635
I've loved you all along,
I think.

15:03.636 --> 15:07.071
See, it's easy for me
to tell you all this now,

15:07.072 --> 15:10.508

you're too doped up to remember.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.517

Oh, shh.

Hi.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.525
Pfft! No, don't...
No talking here.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.026
You're not allowed
to talk in here.

There's no talking,
no dancing here.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.030
None of that.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.498
Burt,

16:07.499 --> 16:09.400
what happened?

16:09.401 --> 16:12.203
All I remember
is a lot of guns going off.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.204
It was nothing.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.706
It was just various people

16:14.707 --> 16:18.176
shooting at other
various people.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.144
Forget about it.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.145

16:21.146 --> 16:25.450
No, no, no.
Everybody's fine.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.884
Only one of us got hit.

16:26.885 --> 16:30.254
Yeah, who?

16:30.255 --> 16:34.359
You, Danny.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.862
Oh.

16:39.798 --> 16:44.469
So, what happened at the party
after I got shot?

16:50.275 --> 16:53.745
We decided to call it a night.

16:53.746 --> 16:58.683
Burt... am I gonna be
all right?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.152
What, are you kidding?

17:01.153 --> 17:05.523
[CHUCKLES]

17:06.925 --> 17:09.426
I'm gonna kill him, Danny.

the last thing I ever do.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.232
Nobody hurts my boy
like this, nobody.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.034
I'm gonna get him,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.469
and he's never gonna hurt
anybody ever again.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.905
Burt, I don't want you to.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.342
Don't worry about it.
I just want you to know, Dan.

Tibbs doesn't have a prayer.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.247
You're a good man, Danny,
and you're kind,

17:29.248 --> 17:30.681

and you're gentle,

he made his big mistake:

when he hurt you.

I'm gonna come back.

Come on, Gwen, that's not true.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.964

because of me.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.871
I mean, that's the thing he's
most proud of in his life.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.873
He was just doing his job
in protecting you.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.374
But he loved me.

and think or something.

one to many.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.381
Of course he's gonna make it.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.283
Doc, tell them that
he's gonna make it.

both kidneys.

We'll put him on a life support
machine for now, but...

19:20.926 --> 19:21.993
He needs another kidney,

19:21.994 --> 19:22.994

19:26.999 --> 19:28.499
He already has my heart,
my soul.

He could have my kidneys,
my lungs.

I want Danny to have my kidney.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.814
Well, Burt it can't be
just anyone's kidney.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.816
It's not
"just anyone's kidney."

19:45.817 --> 19:47.818
It's my kidney,
and it's a great kidney.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.320
I'm telling you,
I take good care of them.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.323
I'd give him a kidney,
but I've only got one.

19:52.324 --> 19:57.295
Okay, all right.
I'll give the kidney.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.863

give anybody an organ.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.866
Especially a kidney.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.802
I know.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.371
All right, I admit it.

I'm an alcoholic, okay?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.377
There, it's out.
I said it.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.880
I'm so ashamed of myself.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.381
If I just didn't drink,

20:17.382 --> 20:21.385
I could save poor old Danny,

Doc, Doc, what do you mean,

20:22.387 --> 20:24.388
it can't be
just anyone's kidney?

20:24.389 --> 20:27.391
Danny has a very singular
tissue type, Burt.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.360
We need to have
an identical match.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.329
So what you're saying here
is I don't match.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.331
We can keep him on
a dialysis machine

20:33.332 --> 20:34.832
for a while,

20:34.833 --> 20:36.334
but eventually we have
to have a donor

20:36.335 --> 20:38.536
with his exact blood
and tissue type.

20:38.537 --> 20:39.604
Doc, what you mean is that

20:39.605 --> 20:41.105
the donor has to be
a blood relative?

20:41.106 --> 20:42.106
Yes.

20:42.107 --> 20:43.608
That's me, I'll do it.

20:43.609 --> 20:44.609
No, Ma, I'll give him
one of mine.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.110
No, Jodie, I'll do it.

20:46.111 --> 20:48.112
You can start
the procedures any time.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.113
Well, Mary, you know,

20:49.114 --> 20:51.115
Jodie's kidneys
would really be...

20:51.116 --> 20:52.550
Danny is my son.
I'll do it.

I'm his brother.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.353
Mare, we all wanna contribute...

Why is everybody
ganging up on me?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.856
Mare, please.
Nobody is ganging up.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.358
I'll do it, and that's that.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.860
Mary, let me say something here.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.363
Look, I've been your doctor
for a long time.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.699
Your kidneys are fine for you.
They'll last you all your life,

21:08.700 --> 21:10.101
but you need both of them.

21:10.102 --> 21:14.038
And even if you could
function with only one,

21:14.039 --> 21:17.008
it wouldn't be strong enough
to support Danny.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.343
Medically, you're
an unsuitable donor.

21:19.344 --> 21:20.812
I'm sorry.

21:22.381 --> 21:23.881
Jodie, if you're agreeable,

21:23.882 --> 21:25.383
we'll start running
some tests now, huh?

21:25.384 --> 21:27.118
Excuse me.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.121
Would you all please leave me
alone with Jodie for a moment?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.024
Of course.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.026
I'll be in my office,
Jodie. Okay.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.028
I'll be in the coffee shop.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.031
Maybe I can put some
black coffee down Bob.
