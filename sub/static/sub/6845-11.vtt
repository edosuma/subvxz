08:39.087 --> 08:40.267
But my name is Steve,

08:40.291 --> 08:41.669
so that might be a little
confusing for everyone.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.498
So maybe pick another name.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.803
Okay, sure. Sorry.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.385
I'm just a little nervous.
You're doing great.

08:46.409 --> 08:47.611
All right. Um, hi.

08:48.021 --> 08:50.349
My name's... Steve.

08:50.588 --> 08:51.590
All right.

08:51.826 --> 08:53.306
I'm gonna be the Steve
in this scene, right?

08:53.330 --> 08:54.744
- So...
- All right, all right.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.770
You're Steve.

08:56.171 --> 08:57.173
Okay.

08:57.409 --> 08:59.156
- Sorry, misunderstanding.
- You're doing great.

08:59.180 --> 09:00.250
- Okay.
- All right.

09:00.619 --> 09:01.833
Hello there, Steve.

09:01.857 --> 09:02.859
My name's...

09:07.206 --> 09:08.208
Steve.

09:08.543 --> 09:09.622
Literally, you know what?

09:09.646 --> 09:12.184
Any other name in the entire universe?

09:18.239 --> 09:19.241
Steve.

09:20.111 --> 09:21.190
Okay, you know what?

09:21.215 --> 09:22.829
Let's give Glenn a round of applause.

09:22.853 --> 09:23.855
You did great.

09:24.123 --> 09:26.711
No worries. All right.

09:26.811 --> 09:28.359
Maybe a different volunteer.

09:28.383 --> 09:30.332
How about you with the purple polo?

09:30.356 --> 09:32.026
Thank you for that, Dina.

09:32.094 --> 09:34.043
Dina's gonna be our union organizer,

09:34.067 --> 09:36.450
and she's gonna try to get
me to sign this union card.

09:36.474 --> 09:39.347
Let's see if Dina is
up for the challenge.

09:40.921 --> 09:43.103
Okay. Hey, how'd you
like to join a union?

09:43.127 --> 09:44.942
No, thanks. I don't need to.

09:44.966 --> 09:47.571
Cloud 9 already listens to my concerns.

09:47.942 --> 09:49.121
I really think it'd
be in your best interests

09:49.145 --> 09:50.124
to sign this card.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.595
Please don't bully me.

09:51.619 --> 09:54.504
I do not need to pay
someone to speak for me.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.932
See? I shut her down.

09:56.235 --> 09:57.581
Those are two examples.

09:57.605 --> 09:58.952
Stop interrupting me.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.024
You will sign this card or I
will choke the life out of you.

10:01.048 --> 10:02.050
Whoa. Wow.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.524
And the Oscar goes to Dina. Right?

10:04.827 --> 10:06.274
See, she was playing a
character there that was...

10:06.298 --> 10:07.644
Oh, I'm not playing a character.

10:07.669 --> 10:10.788
This is me, Dina, talking
to you, union buster Steve.

10:10.812 --> 10:12.024
I'm in a dark place right now,

10:12.048 --> 10:14.198
and quite frankly, I
have nothing left to lose.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.869
So you will sign this [bleep] card,

10:15.893 --> 10:17.340
or I will be waiting for
you in the parking lot

10:17.364 --> 10:18.912
at the end of the night,
where I will wrap my hands

10:18.936 --> 10:20.450
around that tiny chicken neck of yours

10:20.474 --> 10:23.729
and stare deep into your eyes
while I watch the lights go out.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.569
Let's take a break.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.996
[coffee pot sputters]

10:30.471 --> 10:31.941
You want some of mine?

10:36.757 --> 10:38.313
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

10:38.362 --> 10:42.288
Just want to let you know,
I know names besides Steve.

10:42.374 --> 10:43.509
Of course you do.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.782
There's Glenn, and there's, um...

10:48.318 --> 10:49.320
[mouthing]

10:50.497 --> 10:51.863
Steve.

10:54.177 --> 10:55.579
Thanks for your time.

10:56.685 --> 10:58.221
Now you have the facts.

10:58.423 --> 11:01.095
How you choose to use them is up to you.

11:01.666 --> 11:04.003
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you, God.

11:04.574 --> 11:05.576
I know, right?

11:05.778 --> 11:06.913
Excuse me, sorry.

11:07.015 --> 11:09.866
Sorry, guys, but you had
said earlier that maybe we

11:09.890 --> 11:11.873
could voice some concerns
at the end of the meeting?

11:11.897 --> 11:13.032
Thank you, Jonah.

11:13.234 --> 11:14.347
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Absolutely.

11:14.371 --> 11:16.787
Cloud 9 has an open door policy. Great.

11:16.811 --> 11:19.697
So a couple of us were
talking about the possibility

11:19.721 --> 11:22.238
of paid maternity
leave for the employees?

11:22.262 --> 11:24.946
You know, Cloud 9 is devoted
to supporting the welfare

11:24.970 --> 11:26.517
and values of all of its workers.

11:26.541 --> 11:27.543
Okay? Thanks.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.618
Could you be a little more specific?

11:30.988 --> 11:32.302
- I love this.
- Great.

11:32.326 --> 11:35.199
We love this kind of
passion and integrity

11:35.234 --> 11:37.150
that adds to all the
colors of the cloud.

11:37.174 --> 11:40.125
Great, but you're not
actually saying anything.

11:40.149 --> 11:42.486
That's because I'm truly listening.

11:42.657 --> 11:43.903
You know what I just realized?

11:43.927 --> 11:46.077
We have enough doughnut
holes for all of you

11:46.102 --> 11:47.248
to have one more each!

11:47.272 --> 11:48.875
Right? Dig in, everyone.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.864
Guys, they've been there for hours.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.797
That meeting was such a joke.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.848
They're not going to do
anything for Cheyenne.

12:03.872 --> 12:04.918
They don't care.

12:04.942 --> 12:06.389
You're just realizing that now.

12:06.413 --> 12:08.863
This company, that wouldn't
even spring for full doughnuts,

12:08.887 --> 12:10.134
just doughnut holes?

12:10.158 --> 12:12.096
It's not just about Cheyenne.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.578
It's about all of us.

12:13.603 --> 12:15.985
We're the people that
make this company run.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.393
They need to start treating us better.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.067
Like Mateo... what was it you
were complaining about yesterday?

12:21.092 --> 12:22.036
- Oh.
- Remember?

12:22.060 --> 12:23.062
Yeah.

12:23.231 --> 12:25.313
- Why are our customers so ugly?
- Mm, yeah.

12:25.337 --> 12:28.926
No, how they keep us under 40 hours

12:28.989 --> 12:30.503
so they don't have to give us benefits?

12:30.527 --> 12:32.665
Oh, right, yeah. That sucks too.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.849
I haven't had a raise in five years.

12:34.873 --> 12:37.190
- There you go.
- I mean, not to complain.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.360
Sorry, I'm babbling.

12:38.384 --> 12:39.655
- Sorry.
- No, no.

12:39.823 --> 12:41.771
We should be speaking up about this.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.267
It's like we don't have any leverage.

12:44.403 --> 12:47.008
You know, maybe we should form a union.

12:47.245 --> 12:48.314
Okay, calm down.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.400
Dude, you can't get everybody
here to agree to join a union.

12:51.424 --> 12:54.051
We couldn't even agree on a
theme for our summer barbecue.

12:54.051 --> 12:56.234
Ended up being "1980s Arabian Nights

12:56.258 --> 12:57.705
Under The Sea Harry Potter."

12:57.729 --> 13:00.513
So you just want everything
to stay exactly the same?

13:00.537 --> 13:01.516
That's ridiculous!

13:01.540 --> 13:02.943
What if Rosa Parks...

13:03.079 --> 13:04.058
- Whoa.
- Got it.

13:04.082 --> 13:05.151
Amped up, sorry.

13:06.421 --> 13:08.897
Look at him. Mister big pants.

13:09.531 --> 13:12.751
Just waiting for us to slip up
so he can bring the hammer down.

13:12.775 --> 13:15.047
I think he's just having a coffee.

13:15.149 --> 13:16.151
Oh, come on.

13:16.987 --> 13:18.123
Mister big pants.

13:19.027 --> 13:21.833
Just swinging that
big old wiener around.

13:22.137 --> 13:23.807
And we're back to wiener.

13:26.516 --> 13:27.518
Here.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.535
I was told to hand you these to read,

13:29.559 --> 13:31.206
'cause that's my job now.

13:31.230 --> 13:33.034
I drop off pieces of paper.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.142
Look at that.

13:35.444 --> 13:36.446
Nailed it.

13:36.981 --> 13:39.909
- Hey, you want to read one?
- Me?

13:39.957 --> 13:41.839
I mean, it's not exactly
like being the boss,

13:41.863 --> 13:44.413
but it has sort of a voice
of God quality about it.

13:44.437 --> 13:46.441
Everyone has to listen to you.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.658
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers.

13:51.793 --> 13:53.675
We are offering a 10% discount

13:53.699 --> 13:55.948
on all wrapping paper and gift bags.

13:55.972 --> 13:58.244
Come check out this heavenly deal.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.922
- Oh.
- Feels powerful, right?

14:02.159 --> 14:04.174
No, I just never realized my voice

14:04.198 --> 14:06.603
had just such a weak, tinny quality.

14:06.839 --> 14:08.710
No, you've got a nice voice.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.362
No, you've succeeded in humiliating me.

14:11.386 --> 14:13.168
[mocking] "You've succeeded
in humiliating me."

14:13.192 --> 14:14.672
That's me. That's what I sound like.

14:14.696 --> 14:15.675
You don't sound anything like...

14:15.699 --> 14:16.745
Stop making me talk.

14:16.769 --> 14:18.105
This is a nightmare.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.990
- "Intent to unionize."
- Yep.

14:21.015 --> 14:23.799
"International Brotherhood
of Sanitation Workers."

14:23.823 --> 14:24.969
I printed it off the web.

14:24.993 --> 14:26.307
I'm gonna cross that
out and write "Cloud 9."

14:26.331 --> 14:28.413
I'm sorry, were you
not at that extremely long

14:28.437 --> 14:29.651
and early meeting this morning?

14:29.675 --> 14:32.092
Yeah, I was, and all it did was confirm

14:32.116 --> 14:35.001
that nothing is gonna change
around here unless we change it.

14:35.025 --> 14:37.609
If you want to help Cheyenne,
this is the way to do it.

14:37.633 --> 14:38.902
No, this is stupid.

14:39.037 --> 14:40.239
It's worth a shot.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.857
No. That's what you said
about calling corporate

14:42.881 --> 14:44.151
in the first place.

14:44.319 --> 14:46.636
- Not everything is worth a shot.
- I'm sorry.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.511
I'm not the kind of person who
just stands by doing nothing

14:49.535 --> 14:51.349
while people around me need help.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.976
Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it.

14:54.077 --> 14:57.631
You have an image of your head
of leading all the workers out

14:57.655 --> 15:00.126
in some dramatic walkout,

15:00.197 --> 15:01.911
and you're gonna bring down the man.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.684
But let me tell you something.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.590
Real people's jobs are at stake.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.084
I am so sick and tired

15:07.252 --> 15:09.857
of being painted as the stupid idealist

15:09.926 --> 15:11.674
while you get to be the
smart, pragmatic one.

15:11.698 --> 15:13.146
I'm not saying you're stupid.

15:13.170 --> 15:15.352
I'm saying you don't know
how the real world works.

15:15.376 --> 15:17.726
There's a difference between
not knowing how the real world

15:17.750 --> 15:20.635
works and not having the
guts to do something about it.

15:20.659 --> 15:22.507
- Oh, okay.
- Is she having her baby?

15:22.531 --> 15:23.534
[cries out]

15:24.170 --> 15:26.286
- Yeah, I think so.
- We should...

15:26.310 --> 15:27.312
Yeah.

15:32.756 --> 15:35.156
Oh, Cheyenne, she's awesome.

15:35.642 --> 15:37.156
Harmonica.

15:38.182 --> 15:40.454
Oh, could you not baptize my baby?

15:40.591 --> 15:41.593
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:42.029 --> 15:43.031
Force of habit.

15:43.733 --> 15:44.980
Glenn, if it's okay,

15:45.004 --> 15:47.153
I might just be, like, ten
minutes late tomorrow.

15:47.177 --> 15:50.029
Cheyenne, you are not
coming to work tomorrow.

15:50.053 --> 15:51.189
I need the money,

15:51.424 --> 15:54.109
and they said I would mostly
be done bleeding by then.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.850
But you should be
with the baby, though.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.012
It's okay. My mom can watch her.

15:59.148 --> 16:01.029
I'm gonna leave her
with some of my clothes,

16:01.053 --> 16:03.390
so she can start to learn my smell.

16:06.602 --> 16:08.619
Cheyenne, this is unacceptable.

16:08.643 --> 16:10.725
You've distracted us from our work.

16:10.749 --> 16:13.232
You've left your insides
all over the floor,

16:13.256 --> 16:15.305
and now you've brought
your child to work.

16:15.329 --> 16:16.643
- Glenn, what are you...
- No, no, no.

16:16.667 --> 16:17.669
I mean it.

16:17.703 --> 16:18.839
You're suspended.

16:19.175 --> 16:20.177
For four weeks.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.615
With pay.

16:23.588 --> 16:24.790
- But I...
- But?

16:25.093 --> 16:26.874
You want to make it six weeks?

16:26.898 --> 16:28.702
Okay, fine. Bam. Six weeks.

16:29.005 --> 16:30.051
Paid suspension.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.079
You want to keep going, Missy?

16:32.917 --> 16:33.919
No, I'm good.

16:34.822 --> 16:35.824
Good.

16:35.993 --> 16:37.328
I'm ready to go now.

16:37.932 --> 16:39.011
- [mouths] Thank you.
- Bye, Harmonica.

16:39.035 --> 16:40.037
All: Bye.

16:40.071 --> 16:41.140
Congratulations.

16:43.346 --> 16:44.950
- [knock on door]
- Yeah.

16:45.990 --> 16:46.992
Hey, Glenn.

16:48.096 --> 16:51.148
I just wanted to say that what
you did back there was awesome.

16:51.172 --> 16:52.174
Thank you.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.695
Don't worry. You won't
even notice Cheyenne is gone.

16:55.719 --> 16:56.788
I'm not worried.

16:56.889 --> 16:58.760
It's not my problem anymore.

16:59.998 --> 17:01.378
What are you... what
are you talking about?

17:01.403 --> 17:03.111
Yeah, they let me go.

17:03.443 --> 17:04.512
- What?
- Yeah.

17:04.679 --> 17:05.892
They can't just fire you.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.431
You've given your whole
life to this place.

17:07.454 --> 17:10.707
Don't worry, I'll still
be in the store all the time.

17:10.731 --> 17:12.001
Just as a customer.

17:12.536 --> 17:14.819
I'll say stuff like,
"Hey, can you tell me

17:14.844 --> 17:16.626
where the dental floss is?"

I already know where it is.

Unless you decide to move it.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.715
What? What are you talking about?

17:24.740 --> 17:26.221
They asked me if I wanted to make

17:26.244 --> 17:28.027
a suggestion for my replacement,

17:28.050 --> 17:31.057
and nobody knows this
store better than you.

17:31.227 --> 17:33.796
Um, no. I'm not doing it.

17:33.867 --> 17:35.248
Then they'll just get someone else.

17:35.272 --> 17:37.722
I don't care, Glenn.
I'm not taking your job.

17:37.746 --> 17:38.748
Amy, wait!

17:39.452 --> 17:42.592
Someone is going to be
in that chair tomorrow.

17:42.997 --> 17:47.005
And that person has to take
care of everyone in this store.

17:47.443 --> 17:51.188
I'd rather that person
be you than some stranger.

17:55.065 --> 17:57.014
Amy, you're a leader,

17:57.339 --> 18:00.028
and the people here need a leader.

18:01.317 --> 18:02.387
Can you do that?

18:06.533 --> 18:07.535
Yeah.

18:08.340 --> 18:09.342
I can do it.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.133
- Jonah.
- Ah, ah, ah.

18:14.157 --> 18:15.337
You think I'm doing it wrong,

18:15.362 --> 18:17.309

18:17.333 --> 18:19.405
they're less prone to toppling.

18:21.112 --> 18:23.517
- What's wrong?
- They fired Glenn.

18:23.719 --> 18:25.456
- What?
- Yeah, so, um...

18:26.395 --> 18:27.664
