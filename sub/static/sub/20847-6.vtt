WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.507
Count Paris of Mantua never left Verona.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.382
He was nursed back from
the brink of death

00:06.416 --> 00:09.412
by a servant girl
that he and Lady Capulet

00:09.445 --> 00:11.012
plan to use in some way.

00:11.046 --> 00:12.228
Fair Livia.

00:12.261 --> 00:14.148
You lift my spirits so.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.812
Have you managed to bed her yet?

00:15.846 --> 00:18.212
She's proven to be more
of a challenge than I thought.

00:19.430 --> 00:20.261
Aah!

00:20.788 --> 00:23.378
How do you fare after your swordfight?

00:23.411 --> 00:24.977
I'll live.

00:25.011 --> 00:26.641
But I can't say the same for Benvolio.

00:26.675 --> 00:28.050
Send me to Venice.

00:28.084 --> 00:29.362
I want to meet with the Doge.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.270
Capulet owes a large sum of money.

00:31.317 --> 00:32.115
It's why they stopped their work

00:32.149 --> 00:33.810
with only a month left of construction.

00:33.844 --> 00:35.730
If your Grace would allow me,

00:35.764 --> 00:38.579
I'd be happy
to finish the cathedral myself.

00:38.612 --> 00:39.730
I won't let them kill you.

00:39.764 --> 00:41.138
What will you say in my defense?

00:41.172 --> 00:43.286
If you're caught, you'll hang.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.246
But if I go out there

00:44.280 --> 00:46.321
it will buy you the time
you need to get away.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.591
I'm Rosaline Capulet,

00:49.625 --> 00:52.438
and the man you seek left me
here just minutes ago.

00:52.463 --> 00:53.806
I must see the Prince.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.405
Please take me to him.

01:00.598 --> 01:02.037
I don't understand.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.111
Prince Escalus is here?

01:04.757 --> 01:07.572
Your Grace. We found Lady Rosaline.

01:07.866 --> 01:08.696
Your Grace.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.160
Leave us.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.804
Where is Prince Escalus?

01:14.837 --> 01:16.019
He's on his throne, of course.

01:16.053 --> 01:17.779
He left the search for you in my hands.

01:17.813 --> 01:19.731
I'm Count Paris, my lady.

01:19.766 --> 01:20.911
I don't believe we've met.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.878
Now, tell me...

01:24.946 --> 01:27.024
how did you escape your kidnapper?

01:27.058 --> 01:28.272
My kidnapper?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.555
Benvolio Montague.

01:30.589 --> 01:33.034
My Lord, there's been some mistake.

01:33.317 --> 01:35.114
The Montague did not kidnap me.

01:36.510 --> 01:37.308
What?

01:37.341 --> 01:39.393
I left the city with him willingly.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.974
Now, if you would bring me
to the Prince,

01:42.009 --> 01:42.871
I could explain all this.

01:42.905 --> 01:44.253
You're upset.
You're not thinking clearly.

01:44.288 --> 01:46.517
I've never been more clear
about anything in my life.

01:50.008 --> 01:52.150
Let me take you to your tent
and get you something to eat.

01:52.610 --> 01:53.959
We can talk more about this,

01:54.902 --> 01:55.924
just you and me.

Somebody stop them!

02:25.613 --> 02:26.220
Please!

02:26.253 --> 02:28.171
My Lady, what's happened?

02:29.613 --> 02:31.244
Where is Rosaline?

02:31.278 --> 02:32.907
She's been kidnapped...

02:32.941 --> 02:34.554
by that Montague.

02:37.965 --> 02:41.579
Help! Help! Somebody help!

02:47.483 --> 02:49.113
Kidnapped?

02:49.147 --> 02:49.913
By that murderer?

02:49.947 --> 02:53.240
My wife saw him ride off with her.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.841
She... The girl was struggling,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.761
and the scoundrel just held her tight.

02:56.795 --> 02:58.745
She screamed, but of course,
he didn't stop.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.992
But why?

03:00.027 --> 03:01.112
Why take her?

03:01.147 --> 03:03.513
So that he has something of value.

03:03.547 --> 03:05.272
To bargain with.

03:05.306 --> 03:08.344
So, Benvolio was still in the city.

03:08.738 --> 03:10.528
Lying in wait for a moment

03:10.561 --> 03:12.480
when my niece would be unattended.

03:12.513 --> 03:16.864
I... rue the day when I agreed
to marry my flesh and blood

03:16.898 --> 03:18.560
to the villainy of your House.

03:18.593 --> 03:21.819
I would remind you, your Grace,
of my generous offer...

03:21.844 --> 03:22.738
Your offer to what?

03:22.772 --> 03:24.370
To honor our commitment.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.058
To marry your niece
in lieu of my nephew.

03:27.092 --> 03:28.435
Over my dead body!

03:28.468 --> 03:29.522
Then perhaps you'd like to return

03:29.556 --> 03:31.090
the bride price I gave you!

03:31.124 --> 03:32.690
On what grounds?

03:32.724 --> 03:33.714
The girl has been ruined.

03:33.749 --> 03:35.955
No one will believe she could
keep her honor intact

03:35.988 --> 03:39.921
in face of a... a monster
like your nephew.

03:40.443 --> 03:42.296
Who on earth would have her after this?

03:42.330 --> 03:46.296
Let there be no more talk
of honor and bride prices!

03:46.331 --> 03:48.888
Our only goal should be
to return Lady Rosaline

03:48.922 --> 03:50.169
safe and sound.

03:54.362 --> 03:56.440
Double the guards at the city gates.

03:56.474 --> 03:58.681
And tell them they're not
looking for just a fugitive,

03:58.714 --> 04:00.087
but also his victim.

04:00.122 --> 04:01.528
Yes, your Grace.

04:01.562 --> 04:03.064
Wherever she is,

04:03.098 --> 04:05.145
we will find her,

04:06.138 --> 04:08.315
and we will bring her home safe.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.959
Paris?

04:12.402 --> 04:15.788
What is this? What are you wearing?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.661
Lady Capulet was kind enough
to bring me some clothes.

04:18.696 --> 04:21.382
Sweet Livia, we both know I'm well,

04:21.416 --> 04:23.494
thanks in no small part
to the wonderful care

04:23.528 --> 04:25.094
you have taken of me.

04:25.128 --> 04:27.174
But I fear I've stayed here
as long as I can.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.191
Must you go?

04:29.224 --> 04:30.235
Now?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.058
It's my father.

04:31.092 --> 04:33.042
He thinks I'm dead.

04:33.075 --> 04:34.705
I must get back to Mantua.

04:34.739 --> 04:35.922
I should've told you earlier,

04:35.955 --> 04:38.098
but I couldn't bear to see you upset.

04:38.131 --> 04:42.082
I know you're better
and have been for some time,

04:42.123 --> 04:44.072
but it's just...

04:44.107 --> 04:45.449
my sister.

04:45.483 --> 04:47.081
Rosaline? What of her?

04:47.114 --> 04:48.553
She's been kidnapped.

04:48.587 --> 04:49.961
What? When?

04:49.994 --> 04:52.841
An hour ago by the Montague.

04:52.874 --> 04:56.780
Did you... not hear Lady Capulet's cries?

05:00.938 --> 05:03.432
Tell me how I can help.

05:03.467 --> 05:07.332
You can stay until they find her.

05:09.963 --> 05:12.009
- Or until I find her.
- What?

05:12.043 --> 05:13.385
I'm no help to you down here.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.553
But outside these walls,
I have horses, men, money...

05:16.586 --> 05:19.657
all of which I can use
to bring your sister home.

05:19.691 --> 05:21.609
You would do that?

05:21.643 --> 05:23.017
For me?

05:23.050 --> 05:25.289
For you...

05:25.323 --> 05:28.233
Livia.

05:28.267 --> 05:30.856
For you, I would do anything.

05:56.339 --> 05:58.321
Am I never to get a moment's peace?

05:58.356 --> 05:59.249
My Lord...

05:59.283 --> 06:01.511
Yes, Pietro.

06:03.059 --> 06:04.209
Out with it.

06:04.242 --> 06:06.481
I passed by the cathedral just now.

06:06.515 --> 06:08.685
There are workers inside.

06:09.523 --> 06:12.881
That's impossible.
We've stopped construction.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.186
I told them all to go home.

06:15.219 --> 06:17.444
They're not your workers, my Lord.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.589
They're Montague's.

06:29.051 --> 06:31.001
Montague!

06:31.035 --> 06:32.058
Get out of the way!

06:35.201 --> 06:36.063
Oh!

06:41.082 --> 06:43.353
Montague!

06:43.387 --> 06:45.180
Where is he?

06:50.075 --> 06:51.992
Montague!

06:52.801 --> 06:55.584
Lord Capulet, welcome.

06:55.617 --> 06:57.632
Not sure you've ever
been inside my walls.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.168
Is there anything I can get for you?

06:59.202 --> 07:00.768
Food, drink?

07:00.802 --> 07:03.295
What are you doing
in my family's cathedral?

07:03.330 --> 07:04.544
Didn't anyone tell you?

07:04.578 --> 07:09.471
It's our family's cathedral now
by his Grace's royal decree.

07:10.369 --> 07:13.760
Capulets have been building
that church for generations.

07:13.794 --> 07:15.627
And now Montagues will finish it.

07:16.641 --> 07:18.847
I have done nothing
but act in good faith

07:18.882 --> 07:21.472
to stop the war between our Houses...

07:21.506 --> 07:24.845
offering my niece's hand
in marriage to a family

07:24.870 --> 07:27.940
that has caused us
nothing but heartbreak.

07:27.973 --> 07:30.468
Let's not talk about who's done what.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.996
My grievances go back generations.

07:33.029 --> 07:36.611
I am so very pleased
with your visit, my Lord.

07:36.645 --> 07:38.659
But it's not a good time.

07:38.693 --> 07:40.772
If you'll excuse me,

07:40.806 --> 07:43.300
I have some blueprints to review.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.423
My grandfather started work
on that cathedral

08:02.458 --> 08:04.426
before I was born.

08:04.953 --> 08:08.680
He said he was building it
for all the Capulets to come.

08:09.082 --> 08:12.100
I never cared a whit
for all the Capulets.

08:13.351 --> 08:16.354
When it was my turn to keep building...

08:18.164 --> 08:20.018
I only built it for one.

08:22.771 --> 08:24.529
For you, my love.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.353
So that one day,
you would be married there

08:30.388 --> 08:34.448
and baptize your own children there.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.852
And see your own daughter wed

08:36.878 --> 08:38.059
within those walls.

08:46.253 --> 08:48.747
That's why you came to me, isn't it?

08:48.781 --> 08:52.844
To warn me that it would be s...

08:52.877 --> 08:54.684
stolen.

08:55.977 --> 08:58.923
But fear not, sweet daughter.

08:58.958 --> 09:04.277
I promise... I will get it back again.

09:12.881 --> 09:14.192
Paris.

09:14.225 --> 09:15.805
Count Paris.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.168
What are you doing here?

09:19.455 --> 09:20.793
I thought you
were looking for Rosaline...

09:20.818 --> 09:21.833
In due time.

09:21.899 --> 09:22.837
Trust me.

09:25.443 --> 09:26.433
Count Paris.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.546
I have to say I'm rather disappointed

09:34.579 --> 09:37.104
that you didn't come
to Juliet's funeral.

09:37.138 --> 09:38.481
I wanted to, my Lord.

09:38.515 --> 09:39.896
I was just...

09:40.371 --> 09:42.232
too overcome with emotion.

09:43.378 --> 09:45.361
But to not even call upon us?

09:45.394 --> 09:48.113
Well, we all grieve in different ways,

09:48.147 --> 09:50.225
don't we, my love?

09:50.259 --> 09:51.825
I meant no disrespect.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.576
I do hope you can accept my apology.

09:54.611 --> 09:56.016
We've all been through so much.

09:56.050 --> 09:59.376
Juliet, and now Rosaline...

09:59.724 --> 10:00.714
I plan to speak with the Prince...

10:00.747 --> 10:03.817
offer to help in the search
for your beloved niece.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.048
Count Paris, I didn't realize
how much I missed you.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.521
I just wish there was some way

10:12.554 --> 10:14.792
you could still be part of our family.

10:14.827 --> 10:15.817
As do I.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.224
I never expected you
to come back here...

10:25.258 --> 10:27.688
We'll need a story about
how we first met.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.884
When I ask Lord Capulet
for your hand in marriage,

10:30.918 --> 10:32.965
I can't very well tell him
the first time I saw you.

10:32.998 --> 10:35.525
You were pouring hot oil on me
in his basement.

10:56.683 --> 10:57.481
Whoa.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.464
Bianchi!

10:59.499 --> 11:00.713
My Lord.

11:00.747 --> 11:01.897
Come.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.939
I believe I owe you back wages.

11:07.973 --> 11:09.155
Aye, my Lord.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.864
Will that do?

11:13.797 --> 11:15.363
Oh.

11:15.396 --> 11:18.787
You're... most generous.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.073
I have a side job for you.

11:29.618 --> 11:32.783
And he didn't seem to blame us
for Benvolio's treachery?

11:32.818 --> 11:35.024
The Prince knows how supportive
we were of Benvolio

11:35.057 --> 11:37.648
and the Capulet girl's marriage.

11:38.077 --> 11:39.899
I never wished for any of this.

11:39.934 --> 11:43.356
And yet, you've been left
to clean up the mess.

11:43.390 --> 11:46.300
Put your feelings for
our nephew aside, brother...

11:46.334 --> 11:48.251
the Crown may not blame
the Montagues publicly,

11:48.285 --> 11:52.805
but mark my words, this is
a stain upon our family name.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.877
If it is, it will be wiped away

11:54.910 --> 11:57.309
as soon as the dome on
the cathedral is finished.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.997
The House of Montague
will be known far and wide

12:00.031 --> 12:02.750
as the city's greatest patron.

12:02.783 --> 12:04.732
My Lord.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.692
Yes, what is it?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.234
I'm sorry to interrupt...

12:20.908 --> 12:24.936
And what of our name now, brother?

12:30.654 --> 12:33.147
Where are all the workers?

12:33.182 --> 12:34.555
I-It is the curse, my Lord.

12:34.590 --> 12:37.499
There is no curse.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.443
Then how do you explain the
architect falling to his death?

12:40.477 --> 12:44.122
Or the men who died when
that scaffolding collapsed?

12:44.156 --> 12:47.584
Can you not see this is the work
of House Capulet?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.963
I command you to stay.

12:54.027 --> 12:55.466
I'm sorry, my Lord...

12:56.300 --> 13:00.201
...but no amount of coin
is worth my life.

13:03.819 --> 13:05.426
I am sorry, my Lord,

13:05.451 --> 13:07.657
but Prince Escalus is otherwise occup...

13:07.690 --> 13:09.033
This cannot wait...

13:09.067 --> 13:11.113
work on the cathedral
is at a standstill.

13:11.147 --> 13:13.484
Oh, how terrible for you.

13:14.539 --> 13:16.808
The cathedral is
a daunting project, Montague.

13:16.842 --> 13:19.656
Perhaps you've bitten off
more than you can chew?

13:19.690 --> 13:20.648
Capulet.

13:20.682 --> 13:22.825
Do you think I don't know what
you've been up to?

13:22.859 --> 13:24.808
Step aside so I can ask the Prince

13:24.843 --> 13:27.017
if he's any closer
to capturing your nephew.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.617
- My Lord...
- You murdered your architect.

13:28.650 --> 13:29.864
You toppled the scaffolding.

13:29.899 --> 13:32.264
You spread a lie about some "curse."

13:32.298 --> 13:34.088
The only lies I hear
are from your mouth.

13:34.123 --> 13:37.004
You are nothing but a coward
who hides behind his name.

13:37.029 --> 13:38.083
What did you say?

13:39.589 --> 13:42.435
You may be Lord of House Capulet,

13:42.469 --> 13:44.291
but you lost your church

13:44.325 --> 13:46.756
just like your lost your family's money.

13:46.789 --> 13:49.762
And no matter how hard you try
to turn back the tides of fate,

13:49.796 --> 13:54.051
it will be a Montague cathedral
because I will finish it!

13:54.085 --> 13:55.642
- Stay back...
- Get your hands off me.

13:55.677 --> 13:57.923
- I said stay back...
- And I said get your hands off me!

13:57.950 --> 13:59.068
Stand back!

14:02.590 --> 14:04.060
Get me Prince Escalus.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.436
Now!

14:09.021 --> 14:10.908
Lady Rosaline is still missing.

14:10.941 --> 14:13.948
Your Grace, the city's
temperature is rising.

14:14.362 --> 14:15.948
Danger stalks our streets,

14:16.022 --> 14:17.299
and the Montagues and Capulets

14:17.334 --> 14:18.804
are back at each other's throats.

14:18.838 --> 14:22.772
Your leadership, your presence,
is needed here.

14:24.662 --> 14:26.547
What is the meaning of this?

14:26.582 --> 14:28.083
- Explain yourselves!
- Your Grace...

14:28.117 --> 14:30.387
My Prince, I must be heard first.

14:30.422 --> 14:32.468
Capulet's man nearly murdered
one of my own.

14:32.501 --> 14:33.843
Your man was on the attack!

14:33.877 --> 14:35.348
Because your man lunged at me!

14:35.381 --> 14:36.883
Enough!

14:36.917 --> 14:39.237
I'm sick to death of your bickering.

14:42.031 --> 14:43.859
Lord Capulet,

14:44.383 --> 14:46.846
your man will be put in
the stocks for a fortnight.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.670
For doing his job?

14:48.703 --> 14:49.918
You should grateful I'm not putting

14:49.952 --> 14:51.389
the two of you in the stocks, as well,

14:51.423 --> 14:55.293
for bringing your senseless
violence to my doorstep.

14:55.852 --> 14:58.603
Now then, may I return to my duties?

15:04.492 --> 15:05.194
What?

15:05.229 --> 15:06.639
Just...

15:07.116 --> 15:09.726
Lady Rosaline? Any word?

15:10.508 --> 15:11.722
No.

15:22.475 --> 15:27.562
Someday soon, the cathedral
will be ours once more.

15:27.595 --> 15:29.961
I heeded your words,

15:29.996 --> 15:33.737
and I kept my promise, little mouse.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.448
Without your warning,
I would have been lost.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.923
And for that I thank you, my sweet girl.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.401
Beware.

15:53.554 --> 15:56.800
I sent word of my arrival
with no expectation of an audience.

15:57.227 --> 15:59.567
Is there something I can do
for your Grace?

16:00.049 --> 16:02.831
Have you given any thought to
what awaits you on the throne

16:02.866 --> 16:05.072
when you succeed your father?

16:05.106 --> 16:08.034
From time to time. Didn't you?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.120
All too often.

16:14.296 --> 16:15.989
There's been another attack.

16:16.022 --> 16:17.525
He's kidnapped a Capulet.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.227
I need to send more of my men
to the countryside.

16:20.275 --> 16:22.220
- I'm sorry to hear it.
- As am I.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.949
If I had my way,
I'd be riding the hills myself,

16:24.983 --> 16:27.014
hunting Benvolio Montague down.

16:27.048 --> 16:29.126
But a ruler cannot abandon his people.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.845
How many times did I think
my father was a coward

16:31.879 --> 16:33.286
for sitting on the throne
while other men

16:33.319 --> 16:36.166
fought his battles and won his wars?

16:36.199 --> 16:38.278
But now that I'm here,

16:38.311 --> 16:40.421
how can I risk the safety
of all my subjects

16:40.455 --> 16:42.068
for the sake of just one?

16:52.518 --> 16:54.085
What news from the Palace?

16:54.119 --> 16:56.161
Escalus refused my offer of help.

16:56.575 --> 16:59.101
He believes he can handle the
search for Rosaline on his own.

16:59.134 --> 17:00.732
Well, you'll have to change his mind.

17:03.614 --> 17:05.925
How much blood would you have me shed?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.845
To become the Prince of all Verona?

17:09.244 --> 17:11.163
To double your House's lands?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.593
To rule your own city

17:12.627 --> 17:14.941
while your father still sits
upon his throne?

17:15.473 --> 17:18.320
And with my family protected
in the coming war,

17:18.354 --> 17:21.968
my niece at your side,
a Capulet heir in your cradle...

17:22.002 --> 17:24.569
both our Houses will reap their rewards.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.847
You yourself admit Escalus is weak.

17:28.882 --> 17:29.840
Aye.

17:32.178 --> 17:35.184
Then no price should be too high
to take his place.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.029
Were there no guards
posted anywhere near here?

18:01.062 --> 18:03.045
No one who could have stopped this?

18:03.078 --> 18:04.901
There were guards across the square,

18:04.935 --> 18:08.004
but we pulled them
to search for Benvolio Montague.

18:09.607 --> 18:11.141
On your command.

18:14.633 --> 18:17.286
I will get word to my father in Mantua.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.398
It'll take a day for my men to arrive.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.455
Thank you.

18:20.489 --> 18:22.534
And I will find Lady Rosaline

18:22.568 --> 18:25.349
and bring her back
to the Capulets alive.

18:25.683 --> 18:27.536
Bring them both back alive.

18:27.589 --> 18:30.276
Benvolio Montague will face justice.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.179
And I will cut off his head myself.

18:33.606 --> 18:35.012
As you wish.

18:40.044 --> 18:41.865
I know it's not easy.

18:41.899 --> 18:43.662
It weighs on me, as well.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.149
But we've started down
this path, my Lord.

18:46.413 --> 18:48.492
Let us not have come this far in vain.

18:53.664 --> 18:56.213
I wanted to wish you
safe travels, Count Paris.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.667
Livia, your blessings warm my heart.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.869
And fear not...

19:01.902 --> 19:04.397
I will not return without your sister.

19:10.222 --> 19:12.108
My Lady.

19:12.142 --> 19:15.116
Livia, would you leave us, please?

19:15.151 --> 19:16.806
Yes, my Lady.

19:17.710 --> 19:18.988
Safe travels, my Lord.

19:23.854 --> 19:25.964
She's a sweet girl.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.107
And you're going to make her a Princess.

19:28.142 --> 19:29.694
She'll thank you, in time.

19:30.478 --> 19:33.451
When you find Rosaline and Benvolio,

19:33.484 --> 19:35.074
kill him first.

19:35.661 --> 19:37.548
Then find out what she knows
about our plans

19:37.581 --> 19:38.891
and kill her, too.

19:38.925 --> 19:40.780
Even if she knows nothing?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.891
She's still Livia's sister, my Lady.

19:42.925 --> 19:46.669
She should never have let
my Juliet marry that Montague.

19:53.137 --> 19:54.832
You wished to see me, my Lord?

19:56.684 --> 19:58.507
How it is that we have no men posted

19:58.541 --> 20:00.994
on the east or west walls, Pietro?

20:01.095 --> 20:03.301
Does that sound like
a well-guarded estate to you?

20:03.335 --> 20:06.147
My Lord, this is the first
I've heard of your concerns.

20:07.558 --> 20:09.893
The Montague stole my niece
from beneath this very roof.

20:09.926 --> 20:12.005
Who knows what else
they could be plotting?

20:12.647 --> 20:13.925
We should beware.

20:14.258 --> 20:15.248
Always!

20:20.962 --> 20:23.008
What the hell are these doing here?

20:23.041 --> 20:25.440
Lord Capulet had them
commissioned, my Lord.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.904
They were delivered just this morning.

20:29.135 --> 20:32.097
My man lies dying from Capulet wounds.

20:32.130 --> 20:36.960
His artists will have no statues
in my cathedral.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.468
Destroy them.

20:38.502 --> 20:39.588
Yes, my Lord.

20:43.878 --> 20:45.508
I need workers.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.076
But the curse...

20:47.101 --> 20:49.019
There is no curse!

20:49.249 --> 20:51.071
Be that as it may,

20:51.105 --> 20:53.631
it would take a miracle
to get anyone to work here.

21:04.955 --> 21:06.968
God helps those who help themselves.

21:07.299 --> 21:11.713
On second thought, Virgil,
let's keep the statues.

21:16.450 --> 21:17.825
What are you doing here?

21:17.859 --> 21:19.424
How dare you break into these chambers?

21:19.458 --> 21:20.896
How dare you come to this house?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.881
I need the money I was promised

21:22.915 --> 21:24.353
for the business at the chapel.

21:39.485 --> 21:43.519
Do you not believe Paris
should be Prince of Verona?

21:43.554 --> 21:47.873
That his rule would bring our
city back to what it once was?

21:48.930 --> 21:52.032
I... do.

21:52.417 --> 21:54.112
But I have debts, my Lady.

21:54.145 --> 21:55.967
And they must be paid.

21:56.390 --> 21:57.763
So I need that money, or...

21:57.796 --> 21:59.260
Or what?

22:00.772 --> 22:03.222
Did you come here to blackmail me?

22:04.229 --> 22:05.762
I only want what I'm owed.

22:05.796 --> 22:09.112
Do you not know what a generous ruler

22:09.152 --> 22:11.102
our new Prince will be?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.952
I do. I know.

22:13.986 --> 22:17.792
Do you not long for your
children to be Lords and Ladies

22:17.826 --> 22:23.200
instead of peasants
just hoping to survive?

22:23.672 --> 22:27.246
Because this is what
the new Prince offers.

22:28.664 --> 22:32.036
Mantua is the salvation that all
of us have been waiting for.

22:32.503 --> 22:35.125
Do not fear.
You will get what you're owed.

22:35.159 --> 22:38.507
Your family will get its title.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.597
Because the new Prince is coming.

22:56.123 --> 22:57.433
Is there news?

22:57.467 --> 22:58.777
Has Paris found Rosaline?

22:58.810 --> 23:00.863
Not that I've heard.

23:01.883 --> 23:06.137
But Count Paris and I weren't
as close as the two of you.

23:06.171 --> 23:08.217
I... suppose not.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.915
You were quite close.

23:12.891 --> 23:13.816
I have a secret.

23:15.099 --> 23:16.665
All these years,

23:16.698 --> 23:20.345
I thought I'd have to leave
House Capulet to find my love,

23:20.378 --> 23:22.168
and then my love found me.

23:22.202 --> 23:23.545
Your love?

23:23.579 --> 23:25.369
Paris has proposed.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.632
Someday, I'll be his Princess.

23:28.877 --> 23:31.562
Livia, does Lady Capulet
know of your plans?

23:31.702 --> 23:32.949
Not yet.

23:32.982 --> 23:34.677
Paris wants to ask Uncle for my hand

23:34.711 --> 23:36.340
when he returns from finding Rosaline.

23:36.374 --> 23:38.068
You must keep it a secret until then.

23:38.103 --> 23:41.044
There are too many secrets
in this house.

23:43.350 --> 23:45.204
Very well.

23:58.195 --> 23:59.090
Bring this to the Palace.

23:59.123 --> 24:01.202
Don't say who it's from
or how it came to be

24:01.236 --> 24:02.194
in your possession. Understood?

24:02.228 --> 24:04.657
Lord Capulet says no one's
to leave the house.

24:04.691 --> 24:05.841
He says it's too dangerous.

24:05.875 --> 24:06.935
The family isn't to leave.

24:06.969 --> 24:08.753
Servants can come and go all day long.

24:08.788 --> 24:10.896
Go, Carolina. Now.

24:16.468 --> 24:18.961
Move aside! Out of the way!

24:26.162 --> 24:27.729
We've got him!

24:28.155 --> 24:30.233
Get word to the Prince.

24:30.415 --> 24:31.981
We've caught our killer.

24:47.784 --> 24:51.558
Orlino Ruspoli,
the cloak and mask of this...

24:51.592 --> 24:54.150
this Fiend were found in your home.

24:54.184 --> 24:56.583
Do you deny they belong to you?

24:56.616 --> 24:58.406
The clothes are mine.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.670
The clothes are ours.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.328
You make no sense.

25:03.362 --> 25:05.152
Neither do you.

25:05.186 --> 25:06.911
That one so weak
should hold so much power

25:06.946 --> 25:09.887
- over the lives of men...
- You will show your sovereign respect.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.136
That man is not my sovereign!

25:11.169 --> 25:12.448
How is it a peasant

25:12.481 --> 25:14.975
can have rained
so much terror upon our city?

25:15.008 --> 25:17.471
I am one of many...

25:17.506 --> 25:20.128
an army, born high and low.

25:20.161 --> 25:22.847
But when the New Prince comes
to sit upon the throne,

25:23.214 --> 25:25.770
it's the peasants
who'll laugh the hardest

25:25.899 --> 25:28.232
as your head rolls through the streets.

25:28.267 --> 25:31.055
And who is this "New Prince"?

25:31.457 --> 25:33.439
The Fiend is an army.

25:33.674 --> 25:35.912
The Fiend is everywhere.

25:35.947 --> 25:37.704
Enough of this nonsense.

25:37.738 --> 25:40.264
Why do you sow chaos within my walls?

25:40.298 --> 25:42.472
The Fiend is an army,

25:42.506 --> 25:44.232
and the New Prince is coming.

25:44.266 --> 25:45.986
I am the Prince.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.022
You are nothing.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.964
Have him executed for treason.

26:07.998 --> 26:09.597
The New Prince is coming.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.452
The New Prince is coming!

26:11.486 --> 26:13.085
The New Prince is coming!

26:21.286 --> 26:23.332
What are they doing in our church?

26:23.366 --> 26:25.669
- They got word.
- Of what?

26:25.703 --> 26:27.556
The holy miracle.

26:47.019 --> 26:49.130
Please, your Grace, I beg of you.

26:49.163 --> 26:50.792
Do not abandon the city.

26:50.827 --> 26:53.225
Your job is strategy, Defense Minister.

26:53.258 --> 26:54.793
So tell me this...

26:54.826 --> 26:58.708
if Capulet's niece is slain by
Montague's heir, at this moment,

26:58.769 --> 27:00.815
when blood has been spilled
on the Palace steps,

27:00.849 --> 27:04.814
while the rule of law is being
threatened by an army of masked men,

27:04.848 --> 27:06.958
while some unknown enemy
calls himself the New Prince

27:06.992 --> 27:09.486
and plots to take over my throne...

27:10.608 --> 27:13.302
is that not the final straw?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.614
The match that brings the flames of war

27:15.649 --> 27:18.287
to our fair city and burns it
to the ground?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.383
She must be found.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.902
And I cannot sit by
when it is my job to find her.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.081
I'm the one and only Prince.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.069
You hollow out the statue's head,

28:18.102 --> 28:19.564
fill it with colored oil,

28:19.678 --> 28:21.773
poke a tiny hole in the eye, and voilà.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.366
The men are back at work.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.067
Seems the Virgin's sadness
inspired them to return.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.730
Suppose you're found out?

28:27.764 --> 28:30.079
Do you really wish
to be burned for heresy?

28:30.104 --> 28:32.855
Since when you do you care
about anyone but yourself?

28:32.888 --> 28:35.062
I'm just looking out
for our family name.

28:36.728 --> 28:38.581
As I always do.

28:38.616 --> 28:39.605
Where are you off to?

28:39.639 --> 28:40.469
Palace.

28:40.503 --> 28:42.006
- Tessa...
- Don't worry...

28:42.039 --> 28:44.982
I'll be sure to tell them all
of God's great gift.

28:49.485 --> 28:51.244
We lost his trail at the riverbed.

28:51.277 --> 28:52.427
I'll tell Count Paris.

28:52.461 --> 28:53.579
But he won't be happy.

29:04.845 --> 29:07.371
You must be famished after
all those days on the road.

29:07.405 --> 29:08.491
Have some.

29:08.525 --> 29:10.762
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

29:10.796 --> 29:12.842
Suit yourself.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.506
Now tell me...

29:14.540 --> 29:16.586
Why are you so intent on
speaking to the Prince?

29:16.620 --> 29:20.139
Is it wrong for a subject to
want to speak to her sovereign?

29:20.576 --> 29:22.615
He trusted me with the search for you.

29:22.942 --> 29:24.747
Don't you trust me as well?

29:25.389 --> 29:26.699
Of course.

29:26.733 --> 29:27.803
Splendid.

29:27.838 --> 29:30.919
After all, we're going to be family.

29:31.789 --> 29:33.297
What?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.179
I suppose I shouldn't be
the one to tell you,

29:35.212 --> 29:38.219
but your sister Livia
and I have fallen in love.

29:38.253 --> 29:40.245
You stay away from her!

29:40.326 --> 29:41.812
Have I done something wrong?

29:43.620 --> 29:45.092
I'd like to go now.

29:45.126 --> 29:46.340
Please.

29:50.469 --> 29:51.940
Let me go.

29:51.973 --> 29:53.507
Lady Rosaline.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.907
You're not going anywhere.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.548
Count Paris has bewitched Livia,

30:02.581 --> 30:06.132
told her he loves her,
that he plans to wed her.

30:08.213 --> 30:10.324
You knew of this?

30:10.357 --> 30:12.787
It is an advantageous match.

30:12.821 --> 30:14.354
I thought so for Juliet.

30:15.062 --> 30:16.467
I am delighted for Livia.

30:18.452 --> 30:21.139
You know who Count Paris is,

30:21.745 --> 30:23.119
what he is,

30:23.363 --> 30:26.177
no matter who they've got
locked up in that tower.

30:26.211 --> 30:27.586
I know when Paris rules Verona,

30:27.619 --> 30:29.185
the Montagues will be wiped off
this earth.

30:29.219 --> 30:31.905
And only then will I have
justice for my precious Juliet.

30:31.939 --> 30:33.665
Justice...

30:33.700 --> 30:34.817
or revenge?

30:36.739 --> 30:38.654
Go now, Nurse.

30:39.234 --> 30:42.699
Perhaps Lord Capulet would take
an interest in these matters.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.625
Breathe a word of this
to my husband or anyone else

30:46.659 --> 30:48.320
and you'll find yourself
begging on the streets.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.160
You ask to leave my camp.

31:06.194 --> 31:07.888
You won't touch my food.

31:07.922 --> 31:10.321
You don't ask me
how I got to know your sister,

31:10.354 --> 31:12.646
let alone fell in love with her.

31:13.905 --> 31:15.792
I think it's fair to say...

31:15.825 --> 31:18.961
you know some things about me,
Lady Rosaline, am I right?

31:18.994 --> 31:20.656
I'm not afraid of you.

31:20.690 --> 31:22.160
You can't kill me...

31:22.572 --> 31:24.496
the Prince would have your head.

31:24.783 --> 31:28.687
I wouldn't kill you. Benvolio would...

31:29.204 --> 31:32.316
in a fit of rage,
before I could stop him.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.991
Your only chance of surviving this

31:35.025 --> 31:38.031
is to answer my questions.

31:38.065 --> 31:42.863
Now, what exactly do you know
and who told you?

31:48.965 --> 31:51.043
I wish you were more like Livia.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.434
I can get her to tell me anything.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.051
How can you be so cruel?

31:58.085 --> 31:59.586
I'm not the cruel one.

31:59.621 --> 32:01.506
Escalus is.

32:01.737 --> 32:03.811
You should know that better than anyone.

32:03.845 --> 32:05.315
He forced you into a betrothal

32:05.348 --> 32:08.702
with a man whose family
murdered your own father.

32:09.369 --> 32:12.080
How could you be
his loyal subject after that?

32:15.305 --> 32:16.551
My Lord!

32:18.866 --> 32:19.855
What is it?

32:19.889 --> 32:20.944
The horses have gotten free.

32:23.633 --> 32:25.167
Tie up the Capulet.

32:36.533 --> 32:39.058
- The murderer is caught.
- So I've heard.

32:39.093 --> 32:41.006
So then, why are there still
guards all over our House?

32:41.042 --> 32:42.019
For our safety.

32:42.053 --> 32:44.144
Who knows what Montague will do next.

32:44.178 --> 32:46.096
I won't live in a prison, Silvestro.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.200
It is my sacred duty
to protect this House

32:49.234 --> 32:50.736
and everything in it.

32:50.771 --> 32:51.760
Exactly.

32:51.794 --> 32:52.656
I'm sorry?

32:52.690 --> 32:55.216
The chest of gold,
the statues, the horses,

32:55.250 --> 32:56.624
every bauble, every book...

32:56.658 --> 32:58.768
- Yes.
- I am no thing!

32:58.802 --> 33:00.335
Despite your attempts to make me

33:00.370 --> 33:02.928
into some kind of object you can own!

33:02.962 --> 33:05.675
And why should you be
any more to me than that?

33:06.510 --> 33:08.204
You loved my brother.

33:08.238 --> 33:10.252
The whole world knows it.

33:10.835 --> 33:13.196
And I was nothing more to you
than a title...

33:13.229 --> 33:15.027
a means to an end,

33:15.061 --> 33:18.351
a path to you being
the Lady of House Capulet,

33:18.376 --> 33:19.470
which you are.

33:21.884 --> 33:25.818
So don't complain about
being treated as such.

33:25.851 --> 33:28.409
So you lock me in this House
to punish me.

33:28.444 --> 33:29.402
I do not.

33:29.435 --> 33:30.826
You lock me in this House

33:30.861 --> 33:33.000
- to teach me some kind of sick lesson.
- I do not!

33:33.034 --> 33:34.713
You lock me in this House to hurt me.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.610
Guards are here because we must beware.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.234
Of what?

33:39.268 --> 33:41.122
Of... I know not what.

33:41.156 --> 33:42.755
Of s-something that's coming

33:42.789 --> 33:45.131
that I need to stop.

33:46.139 --> 33:47.289
What?

33:58.313 --> 34:00.231
I've s...

34:02.366 --> 34:03.836
I've seen Juliet.

34:09.083 --> 34:13.147
She comes to me, or I to her.

34:13.179 --> 34:18.373
In the crypt, she appears and says...

34:20.766 --> 34:22.558
..."Beware."

34:23.935 --> 34:25.463
You see her?

34:26.303 --> 34:27.708
Yes.

34:42.245 --> 34:44.833
Then, my Lord, you have lost your mind.

34:44.868 --> 34:46.819
No, it's her. I-I know it.

34:46.853 --> 34:48.291
You've lost your mind,

34:48.324 --> 34:51.183
and you'll lose your legacy
to the Montagues,

34:51.217 --> 34:54.411
hiding in this room
like a frightened child

34:54.437 --> 34:57.954
too afraid to fight the war
that's already at your doorstep!

34:58.403 --> 34:59.715
Keep going, Silvestro,

34:59.750 --> 35:01.954
and you'll lose every
precious thing you own.

35:17.535 --> 35:18.808
Stop right there.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.702
Your Grace.

35:25.976 --> 35:27.765
Benvolio Montague.

35:30.341 --> 35:31.522
Drop the dagger.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.949
I'm innocent of everything

35:32.983 --> 35:34.134
I've been accused of, your Grace.

35:34.167 --> 35:37.301
As if your word means anything.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.933
What have you done with Lady Rosaline?

35:39.967 --> 35:41.998
Nothing. Paris has her.

35:42.590 --> 35:44.125
Indeed I do.

35:45.374 --> 35:47.965
She's safe and resting
comfortably, your Grace.

35:48.245 --> 35:49.811
Thank you, Count Paris.

35:49.836 --> 35:51.401
He's lying. She's not safe.

35:51.435 --> 35:52.809
He's the man you're looking for.

35:52.842 --> 35:55.401
Desperate words from a desperate man.

35:55.436 --> 35:56.972
Take him away.

35:57.964 --> 36:00.308
No. No, my Prince, hear me out!

36:04.555 --> 36:06.473
If your Grace will wait here,

36:07.002 --> 36:08.919
I'll bring Lady Rosaline from her tent.

36:19.704 --> 36:21.335
My Lord, I must warn you.

36:21.369 --> 36:22.903
Montague will seek his revenge,

36:22.937 --> 36:24.624
and there will be war.

36:25.369 --> 36:27.702
Then let it be war.

36:40.635 --> 36:43.033
It seems your Prince
is here to save you.

36:54.651 --> 36:56.280
Escalus is here?

36:56.314 --> 36:59.320
In my tent, waiting to make sure
you're safe and sound.

37:00.955 --> 37:04.720
But you were kidnapped, my Lady,

37:04.907 --> 37:07.689
and I rescued you.

37:07.723 --> 37:10.250
No one will believe that.

37:10.283 --> 37:12.380
I left a note for Livia.

37:13.098 --> 37:16.649
This one?

37:16.682 --> 37:18.344
I don't think she got it.

37:20.203 --> 37:22.532
I won't lie for you.

37:23.816 --> 37:26.182
And if I scream now,
the Prince will hear me.

37:26.207 --> 37:29.340
He will. But the Prince
of Verona is alone, my Lady,

37:29.374 --> 37:31.613
surrounded by my men in my camp.

37:31.646 --> 37:37.052
And I can kill him and you
and Benvolio Montague like that.

37:37.086 --> 37:40.253
So I suggest you do exactly as I say

37:40.286 --> 37:42.844
if you ever want a chance
of getting home alive.

37:45.085 --> 37:46.780
And when we're back in Verona,
remember...

37:46.814 --> 37:49.500
I have spies everywhere,
even at the Palace.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.707
If you breathe a word...

37:51.742 --> 37:54.108
...of me... any word at all...

37:54.142 --> 37:56.252
Livia will be the one to pay,

37:56.286 --> 37:58.843
as much as it hurts me to hurt her.

38:02.060 --> 38:04.554
So I suggest you don't scream.

38:04.588 --> 38:06.442
Not now. Not ever.

38:09.159 --> 38:10.245
Shall we?

38:23.389 --> 38:24.443
Juliet?

38:35.068 --> 38:36.250
Juliet?

38:42.108 --> 38:44.154
It's me.

38:48.807 --> 38:50.852
If you love me...

38:52.902 --> 38:56.901
If you love me, reveal yourself.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.291
Lady Rosaline, are you all right?

39:11.747 --> 39:13.408
I am, your Grace.

39:13.442 --> 39:16.588
This... animal didn't hurt you?

39:25.525 --> 39:26.771
He did not.

39:26.805 --> 39:28.435
Thank God.

39:28.469 --> 39:31.477
What happened? Where did he take you?

39:40.003 --> 39:41.747
Juliet...

39:42.672 --> 39:44.590
do you love me?

39:48.593 --> 39:53.103
He... took me from my room
at House Capulet.

39:53.136 --> 39:56.047
We headed towards Padua,

39:56.080 --> 39:58.004
and from there...

39:59.152 --> 40:00.749
I know not.

40:00.783 --> 40:03.789
Until she escaped,
and my men and I found her.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.965
A miracle.

40:09.414 --> 40:12.069
He calls himself
the New Prince of Verona.

40:14.067 --> 40:15.344
Is this true?

40:18.375 --> 40:19.696
Is it?

40:39.820 --> 40:40.905
Yes.
