01:46.852 --> 01:49.320
So, February 1, 2005.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.608
0800 hours.

01:50.676 --> 01:52.711
This begins the inquiry

01:52.778 --> 01:54.379
into the mission herein
referred to

01:54.447 --> 01:56.948
as "Operation
Provide Support."

01:57.016 --> 01:59.851
Commander Axe, do you have
anything to say before we begin?

01:59.919 --> 02:01.186
Uh, well, sir,
it's actually

02:01.253 --> 02:02.721
more of a question
than a statement.

02:02.788 --> 02:04.055
Can I have a beer?

02:06.025 --> 02:07.359
You may not have a beer.

02:07.426 --> 02:09.928
But you may stand up
and raise your right hand.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.432
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.368
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

02:16.435 --> 02:17.736
Yeah.

02:17.803 --> 02:19.237
Uh, sir,
am I on trial here?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.106
'Cause I got the word about
wearing the dress whites,

02:21.173 --> 02:22.774
and now we're doing
the whole oath thing.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.976
For now, this is not
an official legal proceeding.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.712
Think of it
as an informal conversation

02:27.780 --> 02:30.682
to sort out exactly
what happened here.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.317
We've got
over a dozen casualties,

02:32.385 --> 02:36.021
some structures destroyed,
a few vehicles destroyed.

02:36.088 --> 02:40.025
This little disaster is gonna
take some serious sorting out.

02:40.092 --> 02:40.992
I mean, that's why
I suggested the beer.

02:42.294 --> 02:44.929
I'll ask you not to waste
my time, Commander Axe.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.032
Now, can we begin?
You're the boss, sir.

02:47.099 --> 02:49.667
Let's start with how
you first became involved

02:49.735 --> 02:51.069
in this operation.

02:51.137 --> 02:54.506
Ah.
Uh, that kind of depends.

02:54.573 --> 02:56.775
There's kind of
the "official" beginning,

02:56.842 --> 02:58.576
and then the "unofficial"
beginning.

02:58.644 --> 03:00.345
You know what I mean?

03:01.947 --> 03:03.882
Right, well, uh, okay.

03:03.949 --> 03:06.551
This whole thing began...

03:06.619 --> 03:07.719
in bed.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.387
<i>A couple weeks back,</i>

03:09.455 --> 03:11.556
<i>I had just started seeing
a lady by the name of Donna.</i>

03:11.624 --> 03:13.091
<i>Great gal.</i>

03:13.159 --> 03:14.993
<i>Thing is, we were still
getting to know each other,</i>

03:15.061 --> 03:16.494
<i>and it turned out, uh...</i>

03:16.562 --> 03:17.629
<i>I didn't know her
as well as I thought.</i>

03:17.696 --> 03:19.397
Pretty good.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.499
You should come by and teach
the teams a few moves.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.235
You should teach my husband
a few moves.

03:24.303 --> 03:27.172
Wait a second. Your husband?
You're married?

03:27.239 --> 03:29.407
Oh, don't be that way.
It's fine.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.209
Uh, well, no,
actually, uh...

03:31.277 --> 03:32.377
It's not fine.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.545
I kind of have a thing
about that.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.113
He barely looks at me now.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.649
It's like he's not even
my husband anymore. He's just --

03:37.716 --> 03:40.552
oh, my God. He's here.

03:40.619 --> 03:42.454
What?!

03:42.521 --> 03:44.289
I don't understand!
He should still be in D.C.!

03:45.324 --> 03:46.791
That's your husband?

03:46.859 --> 03:48.626
You're married
to Admiral Maitland?

03:48.694 --> 03:51.062
Just -- just go, okay?

03:51.130 --> 03:52.997
No, no, not that way!
He'll see you!

03:53.065 --> 03:54.466
No! The bathroom!

03:58.737 --> 04:03.508
Well, it's been great.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.177
<i>Now, as a S.E.A.L.,</i>

04:06.245 --> 04:08.913
<i>I've been involved in evasive
maneuvers, but this...</i>

04:10.749 --> 04:12.517
<i>...Was an unusual
tactical situation.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:14.419
Hey, Donna?!

04:14.487 --> 04:16.788
What's the matter with Buster?
He's going crazy out here.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.356
I don't know.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.259
<i>Still, same principles apply
in any hostile encounter</i>

04:21.327 --> 04:23.461
<i>when you need to get out clean
without engaging the enemy --</i>

04:23.529 --> 04:25.763
<i>identify an escape route...</i>

04:25.831 --> 04:27.966
<i>Ooh!
...And blend seamlessly
into the surroundings.</i>

04:28.033 --> 04:31.169
Wait, wait --
how exactly does this relate

04:31.237 --> 04:32.637
to the mission
in question?

04:32.705 --> 04:33.838
Uh,
I'm getting there, sir.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.340
This -- this is important,
I promise.

04:35.407 --> 04:37.208
I just don't want to hear any
more of your romantic escapades.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.610
Is there a point?

04:38.677 --> 04:40.011
<i>Okay, so, that night...
...I headed out.</i>

04:40.079 --> 04:41.713
<i>Now, with this type of problem,</i>

04:41.780 --> 04:45.383
<i>some men will duck and cover,
others will turn to booze.</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:49.454
<i>Me? Let's just say I have
my own secret weapon.</i>

04:49.522 --> 04:51.723
I swear, every time I see you,
you look different.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.959
Comes with the job, Sam.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.262
Hey, nice tan, Mikey.
Where you been?

04:57.329 --> 04:58.897
Someplace sunny.

04:58.964 --> 05:00.798
Well, it agrees with you --
I remember how pasty you got

05:00.866 --> 05:03.201
when we were stuck
back in Poland in '92.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.302
Hey, how long you in town?

05:04.370 --> 05:05.737
A few days of debriefing
at least.

05:05.804 --> 05:07.372
We'll see.

05:07.439 --> 05:10.074
So, not to impose, but you feel
like advising an old buddy

05:10.142 --> 05:11.209
with a sticky situation?

05:12.611 --> 05:14.712
How sticky?

05:14.780 --> 05:16.848
Sticky like, let's get a table
and a few more rounds.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.350
Sam.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.954
An admiral?

05:23.022 --> 05:25.390
It had to be
an admiral's wife?

05:25.457 --> 05:26.758
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:26.825 --> 05:28.493
So, look, what do you think
I should do here?

05:28.561 --> 05:30.028
Go to Maitland
and explain.

05:30.095 --> 05:31.529
Tell him you didn't know
who she was

05:31.597 --> 05:33.898
until things had already
gotten out of hand.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.333
In fact,
call him right now.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.735
Mike,
that's not what I --

05:37.803 --> 05:39.804
look, I was more looking
for that super-spy advice

05:39.872 --> 05:41.906
on how to keep this quiet.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.274
You remember that thing in Kiev
with Misha?

05:43.342 --> 05:45.510
When he sold out the wetwork
team on their way to Paris?

05:45.578 --> 05:46.778
Hell, yeah.
What about that?

05:46.845 --> 05:49.013
That's the kind of secret
that stays secret.

05:49.081 --> 05:51.816
Because if it comes out,
people get sent to Siberia.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.518
This will come out
as soon as Maitland

05:53.586 --> 05:55.086
looks sideways
at his wife.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.155
Seriously, Mike, you know,
I know you're a smart guy,

05:57.223 --> 05:58.590
but you've dated,
like, one lady,

05:58.657 --> 05:59.791
and she was
a frickin' psycho.

05:59.858 --> 06:01.492
I'm just saying...

06:01.560 --> 06:04.596
You may not be the expert
on this whole boy-girl thing.

06:04.663 --> 06:06.698
My job is to know what people
are gonna do before they do it.

06:06.765 --> 06:09.133
Which is how I know you're
not gonna take my advice

06:09.201 --> 06:10.802
and this is gonna blow up
in your face, Sam.

06:10.869 --> 06:12.270
I don't know.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.239
I mean, how smart
can spies be, right?

06:14.306 --> 06:16.441
You're always fighting
on the side with no guns.

06:16.508 --> 06:17.675
There are certain rewards

06:17.743 --> 06:19.344
to fighting on the side
with no guns.

06:21.113 --> 06:22.981
Tell you what, one day,

06:23.048 --> 06:25.116
you're gonna give me
some spy lessons, deal?

06:25.184 --> 06:27.252
Deal.

06:27.319 --> 06:29.988
Mm. I got to go.

06:30.055 --> 06:31.823
You gonna be all right?

06:31.890 --> 06:32.957
Yeah, I'll be fine.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.292
Thanks for the beer.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.627
Oh, and, Sam...

06:36.762 --> 06:37.862
...Be careful.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.871
<i>So, I have a few more drinks
and head home,</i>

06:46.939 --> 06:48.539
<i>figuring that maybe it's best</i>

06:48.607 --> 06:50.074
<i>not to get relationship advice
from a spy.</i>

06:52.344 --> 06:54.012
<i>Thing is,
turned out the spy was right.</i>

06:54.079 --> 06:56.714
Commander Axe?
You need to come with us.

06:56.782 --> 06:59.550
Says who?!

06:59.618 --> 07:01.586
You were in my house...

07:01.654 --> 07:03.621
In bed with my wife!

07:03.689 --> 07:05.857
And don't even try to deny it,
'cause I found your belt.

07:05.924 --> 07:07.225
Does that look familiar?

07:07.293 --> 07:09.227
I talked to Donna,
and she told me everything.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.229
Admiral,
I was unaware, sir,

07:11.297 --> 07:12.163
that she was your
significant other.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.998
You were unaware?

07:14.066 --> 07:15.967
You're a Navy S.E.A.L.!

07:16.035 --> 07:17.302
You're trained
in battlefield awareness,

07:17.369 --> 07:20.004
and you didn't see my name
on the mailbox?!

07:20.072 --> 07:22.173
Well, sir, I wasn't exactly
in that frame of mind, sir.

07:22.241 --> 07:24.208
A-as you can imagine,
I was otherwise occupied, sir.

07:24.276 --> 07:26.978
I'll stop talking now,
sir.

07:28.847 --> 07:31.182
So, I checked my docket
for an assignment

07:31.250 --> 07:32.417
that would get you
out of my sight

07:32.484 --> 07:33.851
for the foreseeable future.

07:33.919 --> 07:35.520
And I think I found
just the thing.

07:35.587 --> 07:39.490
<i>Oh, not Siberia.
Please not Siberia.</i>

07:39.558 --> 07:42.460
You're going to Colombia.
Tonight.

07:42.528 --> 07:43.795
Oh, sir,
with all due respect,

07:43.862 --> 07:45.596
I'd need to pack, sir,
and, well, uh --

07:45.664 --> 07:46.998
Are you refusing orders?
No, sir. No, sir.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.366
Of course not.
It's just that I --

07:48.434 --> 07:49.701
well,
it's been a while, sir.

07:49.768 --> 07:51.669
And, of course,
for a mission in South America,

07:51.737 --> 07:53.471
I should really brush up
on my Spanish.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.574
Well, you got a 12-hour
plane ride, so...

07:58.143 --> 07:59.844
...Brush up, amigo.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.879
"Amigo."
That's "friend," right, sir?

08:01.947 --> 08:03.281
Get the hell
out of my office!

08:12.024 --> 08:14.826
<i>So, like a good soldier,</i>

08:14.893 --> 08:16.694
<i>the next morning
I was up bright and early</i>

08:16.762 --> 08:20.098
<i>enjoying a first-class
plane ride down to Colombia.</i>

08:26.271 --> 08:28.106
Hey!

08:29.908 --> 08:32.110
What the hell
are you wearing, brother?

08:32.177 --> 08:33.845
I got issued these.

08:33.912 --> 08:36.179
You do know most of Colombia
is green, right?

08:36.248 --> 08:37.582
Yeah, I don't think
the guy who issued them

08:37.649 --> 08:38.850
wanted me to blend in.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.217
Can you turn that crap off?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.154
You know, I was
supposed to be takin'

08:43.222 --> 08:45.423
some Green Beret named Donohue
down on this mission.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.059
Heard he got drunk
and set a tank on fire.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.794
Guess you screwed up
even worse, huh?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.562
Yeah, it would seem so.

08:51.630 --> 08:52.764
What did you do?

08:52.831 --> 08:54.365
Must have been
something crazy, man!

08:54.433 --> 08:56.167
Look, I don't
want to get into it, okay?

08:56.235 --> 08:57.402
Suit yourself.

08:57.469 --> 08:59.370
Good luck, big guy!

08:59.438 --> 09:00.438
Yeah, thanks.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.644
<i>I read over the mission.</i>

09:06.712 --> 09:08.079
<i>Essentially I was going down</i>

09:08.147 --> 09:10.281
<i>to check on reports
of unrest in the region.</i>

09:10.349 --> 09:12.150
<i>Basically,
a local Colombian official</i>

09:12.217 --> 09:14.685
<i>with connections in the states
called in a few favors.</i>

09:14.753 --> 09:17.155
<i>He needed someone to observe
and report on a situation</i>

09:17.222 --> 09:19.357
<i>so he could scare up
some U.S. military aid.</i>

09:19.425 --> 09:21.526
<i>And I was the lucky guy</i>

09:21.593 --> 09:23.828
<i>who got to do the observing
and reporting.</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:26.030
So, I read the file, but I was
hoping you could fill me in

09:26.098 --> 09:27.365
on the basics
of the situation.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.001
I was dropped into this
a little...suddenly.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.969
This group, the so-called
"Espada Ardiente,"

09:32.037 --> 09:35.306
has been staging serious attacks
all over this countryside.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.476
And the situation is getting
only worse and worse.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.211
We need help.
Espada Ardiente.

09:40.279 --> 09:43.047
Is that some kind of homegrown
insurgent group?

09:43.115 --> 09:45.183
Yes. Actually,
we don't know much about them.

09:45.250 --> 09:48.219
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.987
Will you follow me,
please?

09:50.055 --> 09:51.355
Commandante Veracruz!

09:51.423 --> 09:53.758
Let me introduce
Commander Axe.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.060
It is a pleasure,
Commander Axe.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.696
Commandante Veracruz
has worked before with American soldiers.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.131
He is at your disposal.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.966
I believe we have
mutual acquaintances.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.302
I trained at the school
of the Americas in '92.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.204
Well, hell,
if you trained there in '92,

10:06.271 --> 10:07.738
I knew every last
son of a bitch

10:07.806 --> 10:09.340
that made you do push-ups
in the mud.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.609
Vick Rayburn.
No, no, no. You mean...

10:11.677 --> 10:12.543
"The terror."
That's the guy.
..."The terror." Of course.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.212
So, what's the plan?

10:15.647 --> 10:18.349
We have intelligence
that Espada Ardiente

10:18.417 --> 10:21.018
is planning to attack
an international clinic

10:21.086 --> 10:23.221
run by a group
called "Doctors For All."

10:24.389 --> 10:27.325
A hospital. Seriously?
Unfortunately, yes.

10:27.392 --> 10:29.560
Until now, they have stayed
clear of civilian targets.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.596
The clinic sits in a strategic
pass in the mountains.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.731
We believe the terrorists
want to use it

10:33.799 --> 10:35.433
to take control
of that region.

10:35.501 --> 10:38.135
Our plan is for you
and Commandante Veracruz

10:38.203 --> 10:40.338
to get there
before that can happen.

10:40.405 --> 10:42.073
I trust we are
in good hands?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.508
Of course.
Thank you, sir.

10:43.575 --> 10:44.775
Goodbye.

10:44.843 --> 10:46.010
Let's meet the guys.
Fantastic. Please.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.044
Hello, señor.

10:47.112 --> 10:48.946
Whoa, oh!

10:49.014 --> 10:51.849
<i>So it was the standard drill.
I met Veracruz's team.</i>

10:51.917 --> 10:53.918
<i>And we headed out up the
mountains toward the territory</i>

10:53.986 --> 10:58.356
<i>that this Espada Ardiente group
was occupying.</i>

11:02.361 --> 11:03.761
<i>Spent a couple days
driving up and down mountains</i>

11:03.829 --> 11:06.230
<i>and getting carsick.</i>

11:06.298 --> 11:08.966
<i>Not much to report, at least
until we got further north</i>

11:09.034 --> 11:10.234
<i>and started seeing
some of the places</i>

11:10.302 --> 11:12.103
<i>these guys had attacked.</i>

11:12.170 --> 11:13.571
<i>It was mostly little stuff --</i>

11:13.639 --> 11:15.439
<i>blown-up vehicles,
burned campsites --</i>

11:15.507 --> 11:17.241
<i>but it was enough
to make me think</i>

11:17.309 --> 11:18.809
<i>we needed to get
to this clinic asap,</i>

11:18.877 --> 11:20.244
<i>make sure nothing happened.</i>

11:20.312 --> 11:22.680
<i>The clinic
was conveniently located</i>

11:22.748 --> 11:23.881
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

11:23.949 --> 11:25.383
<i>After our long trek there,</i>

11:25.450 --> 11:27.552
<i>I figured they'd offer us
a beer for our trouble.</i>

11:27.619 --> 11:29.854
<i>But they weren't exactly happy
to see us.</i>

11:29.922 --> 11:31.455
Okay, this is --
this is just crazy.

11:31.523 --> 11:34.025
Why would anyone attack the clinic?
I'm sorry, doctor.

11:34.092 --> 11:36.561
But our intelligence indicates
there may be an attack.

11:36.628 --> 11:38.062
And so what are we
supposed to do, hmm?

11:38.130 --> 11:40.197
Uh, evacuate?
That would be best.

11:40.265 --> 11:41.832
We can give you
until tomorrow to --
to -- to --

11:41.900 --> 11:43.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tomorr--

11:43.268 --> 11:44.969
listen, I've got people in there
too sick to move.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.704
Now, how am I supposed to
evacuate by t--

11:46.772 --> 11:48.506
Okay. Hey, guys. Hey.
You know, let me handle this.

11:48.574 --> 11:49.674
American to American.

11:49.741 --> 11:51.742
I'm Canadian.

11:51.810 --> 11:55.046
Uh, North American
to North American?

11:55.113 --> 11:57.381
Look, you know, we're not trying
to bust your chops here,

11:57.449 --> 11:59.517
but you're not gonna help your
patients if you guys get shot.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.018
Listen, sir,
we don't have any problems

12:01.086 --> 12:03.254
with the Espada Ardiente,
okay?

12:03.322 --> 12:05.523
<i>Un segundo, un segundo.
Okay, please.</i>

12:05.591 --> 12:08.292
So -- so just tell me,
how am I supposed to

12:08.360 --> 12:10.027
evacuate my clinic by tomorrow?
Hey, Ben.

12:10.095 --> 12:11.329
Hi.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.864
Why don't you go
and take care of the patient?

12:13.932 --> 12:16.167
And I've got this.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.535
Yeah?

12:17.603 --> 12:19.036
This way, soldier.

12:19.104 --> 12:21.105
It's, uh, "Commander,"
actually.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.107
Sorry about that.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.342
Yeah,
what's his problem?

12:24.409 --> 12:26.711
He's a doctor.
It's his job to cure people.

12:26.778 --> 12:29.280
You're a soldier.
It's your job to kill them.

12:29.348 --> 12:31.749
Take a wild guess what his
problem might be, bright eyes.

12:31.817 --> 12:32.950
And you are?

12:33.018 --> 12:34.185
Amanda Maples.

12:34.252 --> 12:35.786
I'm with the local
food relief program.

12:35.854 --> 12:37.254
We work out of the clinic.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.390
Nice threads, by the way.
Really subtle.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.691
Yeah. It's a long story.
Ah.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.760
So, you want to talk
to your buddy in there?

12:42.828 --> 12:43.694
'Cause you guys
could be in danger.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.062
Yeah, I'll do my best.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.764
For now, though,
we'd all really appreciate it

12:46.832 --> 12:48.432
if you'd get lost.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.301
'Cause if we weren't
a target before,

12:50.369 --> 12:52.436
we definitely will be
if you guys don't leave.

12:52.504 --> 12:54.338
As a soldier,
I can't just leave.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.041
Sure you can. You just --
you get in the truck.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.709
And you turn the key,

12:58.777 --> 13:00.177
you put your foot on the
pedal -- it's on the floor --

13:00.245 --> 13:01.278
and you go.

13:16.628 --> 13:19.397
What's going on?
Who's the kid?

13:19.464 --> 13:21.198
She may be with one
of the terrorists.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.300
We caught her sneaking
into one of the trucks.

13:23.368 --> 13:24.535
Aah!
Hey, hey.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.469
Everybody
just calm down here.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.972
Geez. Okay.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.306
So, kid...

13:36.081 --> 13:37.481
Okay, guys, come on.

13:37.549 --> 13:40.384
She's just looking for something
to eat. Let's not go crazy.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.953
It's not our mission to rough up
hungry teenagers, right?

13:43.021 --> 13:45.523
No. Of course.
Of course. Of course.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.026
Here you go, kid.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.733
So, look,
I talked to the doctor

13:55.801 --> 13:57.001
and the lady
from the food-aid program,

13:57.069 --> 13:59.303
but they don't know anything
about an attack.

13:59.371 --> 14:03.074
All I got out of them was a
polite invitation to screw off.

14:03.141 --> 14:04.675
We will make camp nearby.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.511
If there is an attack,
we will be ready.

14:17.255 --> 14:19.223
<i>Veracruz's camp
was pretty remote.</i>

14:19.291 --> 14:22.727
<i>But let me tell you, his guys
were seriously well-armed.</i>

14:22.794 --> 14:25.863
<i>I didn't know exactly
who we were up against yet,</i>

14:25.931 --> 14:28.499
<i>but they had enough firepower
to wipe them off the map.</i>

14:28.567 --> 14:31.669
<i>So I decided I'd just keep
my head down, do my job,</i>

14:31.737 --> 14:34.071
<i>and make my reports to H.Q.
Like a good boy.</i>

14:37.042 --> 14:41.112
Commander Axe
for Admiral Maitland, please.

14:41.179 --> 14:44.115
Yes, sir, uh, no contact
with any terrorists yet, sir.

14:44.182 --> 14:45.616
We're a couple of miles
from the clinic.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.152
Good. Carry on
as long as it takes.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.423
Sir, what exactly does
"as long as it takes" mean?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.825
It means "next time,

14:54.893 --> 14:57.495
stay away from the wives
of ranking officers."

14:57.562 --> 14:59.029
Uh...

14:59.097 --> 15:01.132
See you in a few months.
Roger that.

15:01.199 --> 15:03.167
Hey. Just calling to command
to let them know what's up.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.237
Fantastic. Perhaps you would
like to relax, eat some supper?

15:06.304 --> 15:07.671
My men and I are
going to scout the area.

15:07.739 --> 15:09.473
Oh, good. Well, I'll go with
you. My gear's right in there.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.809
Actually, señor, it is better
if you stay here.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.043
Whoa. Stay here?

15:13.111 --> 15:14.712
I mean, I can't exactly
observe and report

15:14.780 --> 15:16.147
from the inside of my tent,
can I?

15:16.214 --> 15:18.048
Come on, I can handle
a little night scouting, huh?

15:18.116 --> 15:19.517
I'm sure you can,
Commander Axe.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.952
But I am responsible
for your safety.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.954
If we make contact
with the terrorists,

15:24.022 --> 15:25.823
we will come for you
immediately.

15:30.162 --> 15:35.065
This is where things
kind of started to go sideways.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.801
You might want to mark that down
in your notes.

15:36.868 --> 15:38.569
"Things went sideways."

15:38.637 --> 15:39.904
So, what did you do?

15:39.971 --> 15:44.041
I guess you could say
I modified my orders.

15:52.818 --> 15:53.984
Well, señor...

15:58.890 --> 16:00.658
<i>Buenos noches.</i>

16:12.170 --> 16:14.104
<i>So I decided to conduct
a scout of my own.</i>

16:27.118 --> 16:29.520
<i>I did a basic perimeter check.</i>

16:29.588 --> 16:31.522
<i>Searched for tire tracks,
signs of activity.</i>

16:31.590 --> 16:33.691
<i>The only hostile forces I found</i>

16:33.758 --> 16:36.026
<i>was a nest of spiders
as big as quarters.</i>

16:36.094 --> 16:38.562
<i>And in the middle of fighting
those little bastards off,</i>

16:38.630 --> 16:39.997
<i>I hear voices.</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:47.738
<i>I go in, check it out,</i>

16:47.806 --> 16:49.240
<i>thinking maybe it was
the Espada Ardiente guys.</i>

16:49.307 --> 16:51.675
<i>But what do I find instead?</i>

16:51.743 --> 16:53.377
<i>Veracruz,
unloading a bunch of weapons</i>

16:53.445 --> 16:55.479
<i>from a hidey-hole
in the mountain.</i>

16:55.547 --> 16:57.214
<i>I listen in
on their conversation,</i>

16:57.282 --> 16:59.049
<i>and guess what I hear --</i>

16:59.117 --> 17:01.852
<i>they're planning on attacking
the clinic themselves</i>

17:01.920 --> 17:03.754
<i>and making it look
like the rebels did it.</i>

17:03.822 --> 17:05.489
<i>And after I make my report...</i>

17:05.557 --> 17:08.192
We destroy the clinic then shoot
the American in the head.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.929
Son of a bitch.

17:14.717 --> 17:16.765
<i>I bet lots of stuff
go bad in an operations.</i>

17:16.785 --> 17:18.252
<i>But finding out
I was supposed to get killed</i>

17:18.319 --> 17:20.688
<i>as part of a plot
to get U.S. military aid?</i>

17:20.756 --> 17:21.856
<i>That was a new one.</i>

17:21.924 --> 17:23.523
<i>So I just stayed calm</i>

17:23.592 --> 17:25.560
<i>and made my way back to camp
as efficiently as possible.</i>

17:25.627 --> 17:27.362
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

17:27.429 --> 17:30.098
L-l-let's go back, here.
I'm confused.

17:30.165 --> 17:31.766
Y-you're saying
you did not make contact

17:31.834 --> 17:34.135
with Espada Ardiente
at this point?

17:34.203 --> 17:36.337
- Because our reports indicate --
- Well, where did you get the reports?

17:36.405 --> 17:38.239
From Veracruz's
paramilitaries?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.108
And, what, you think
they were gonna announce

17:40.175 --> 17:41.442
that they were
officially planning

17:41.510 --> 17:42.844
on putting two in the back
of my head?

17:42.911 --> 17:44.078
What I really
want to hear about

17:44.146 --> 17:47.115
is how you were kidnapped
by terrorist forces.

17:48.517 --> 17:51.919
Oh. Yeah, well,
that's not entirely accurate.

17:54.223 --> 17:56.557
<i>See, I couldn't let Veracruz
know that I was onto him.</i>

17:58.260 --> 17:59.560
<i>So I put together</i>

17:59.628 --> 18:01.162
<i>a little kidnapping scene
for them to find</i>

18:01.230 --> 18:02.997
<i>and double-timed it
back to the clinic.</i>

18:11.740 --> 18:13.207
Man, what -- what the hell
are you doing down here, man?

18:13.275 --> 18:15.076
It's 5:00 a.m.

18:15.144 --> 18:17.178
You and me need to talk.
Now.

18:19.648 --> 18:21.949
Okay, so,
I-I-I'm confused here.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.218
Why would anybody
want to attack us?

18:24.286 --> 18:25.553
Because it's a ploy.

18:25.621 --> 18:26.954
If they can make
this terrorist group

18:27.022 --> 18:29.524
look like they massacred
a clinic and killed yours truly,

18:29.591 --> 18:31.259
Veracruz can do
anything he wants down here

18:31.327 --> 18:32.727
and get a blank check to do it.

18:32.795 --> 18:36.864
Right, but here's the thing --
we're not political. Okay?

18:36.932 --> 18:38.499
I've never even heard
of the es-- w-what is it?

18:38.567 --> 18:39.701
Espada Ardiente.
Yeah.

18:39.768 --> 18:41.269
Yeah.
It happens all the time.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.770
I saw it when I worked
in Africa.

18:42.838 --> 18:44.739
Some military group
needs aid,

18:44.807 --> 18:46.407
so they do something
really terrible

18:46.475 --> 18:47.709
and blame it
on their enemies.

18:50.312 --> 18:53.748
The point is, you guys
got to move fast, okay?

18:53.816 --> 18:55.516
So, in the meantime,
I need your sat phone.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.687
Yeah, okay.
Good luck there.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.256
When we need to make a call, we have
to go all the way to Santa Marta.

19:02.324 --> 19:04.058
Seriously?
You got nothing?

19:04.126 --> 19:06.294
Hey, we're not
the Mayo Clinic.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.562
And quick question --

19:07.563 --> 19:09.063
how do you propose that
we get out of here?

19:09.064 --> 19:10.765
On our --
on our Medevac helicopter?

19:10.833 --> 19:12.066
Or our fleet of ambulances?

19:12.134 --> 19:13.835
We are a tiny clinic
in the mountains.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.037
I'm not the one
you're fighting here.

19:16.105 --> 19:17.538
I'm just trying to
lay it out for you.

19:17.606 --> 19:19.107
And we appreciate it.

19:19.174 --> 19:22.210
But this Veracruz of yours
is looking for you,

19:22.277 --> 19:23.678
and we can't have him
finding you here.

19:23.746 --> 19:27.615
So...just go.
We can take care of ourselves.

19:41.263 --> 19:45.400
He must have
been kidnapped.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.168
Did you hear anything else?
No, nothing.

19:47.236 --> 19:49.270
Sorry, Commander.
It's okay.

19:49.338 --> 19:51.506
You still have an important role to this
mission, señor Garcia.

19:51.573 --> 19:53.307
When I tell the Americans
what happened,

19:53.375 --> 19:54.409
I will say
you bravely tried

19:54.476 --> 19:56.177
to fight off
the Espada Ardiente.

19:56.245 --> 19:57.445
But sadly...

19:58.881 --> 19:59.814
You were killed.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.187
Throw his body
in the ravine

20:06.255 --> 20:07.722
and take pictures
for the report.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.990
And the clinic?

20:09.057 --> 20:10.892
With the American gone,
there's no use waiting.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.361
We will destroy the clinic
ourselves and make the report.

20:13.429 --> 20:16.297
<i>So the bad news was Veracruz
was making his move early --</i>

20:16.365 --> 20:19.000
<i>a fact I learned
when I ran into a familiar face</i>

20:19.067 --> 20:20.401
<i>on the road.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:21.469
Oh. Jesus, what --

20:23.138 --> 20:25.039
You're the kid from earlier,
right? The food thief?

20:25.107 --> 20:26.407
What the hell
are you doing back here?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.942
I'm trying to get people
out of the clinic.

20:28.010 --> 20:29.877
Okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:29.945 --> 20:31.813
Slow down a second.
Since when do you speak English?

20:31.880 --> 20:33.314
I used to watch
"Full House."

20:33.382 --> 20:35.917
You know, Veracruz is coming!
We have to go!

20:35.984 --> 20:37.218
Veracruz?
How do you know he's coming?

20:37.286 --> 20:38.619
I was watching his camp.

20:38.687 --> 20:39.887
<i>You were spying
on his camp.</i>

20:39.955 --> 20:42.156
I wasn't spying.
I was trying to steal food.

20:42.224 --> 20:43.324
And they caught me,
and then I tried again.

20:43.392 --> 20:44.692
What do you care?!

20:44.760 --> 20:47.028
Veracruz shot one of his men
for letting you escape!

20:47.095 --> 20:50.698
He's on his way here now!
He's on his way here now!

20:52.668 --> 20:55.703
Hey. Whoa. Oh.

20:55.771 --> 20:56.804
No, no.
Not you again.

20:56.872 --> 20:58.039
I thought
I told you to go --

20:58.106 --> 21:00.174
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
I got a new plan.

21:00.242 --> 21:01.609
We're gonna get everybody
out of here. Now.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.944
Uh, c-commander,
could you maybe --

21:03.011 --> 21:04.412
can you slow down
and then explain?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.080
Yeah.
This is not the time to slow down.

21:06.148 --> 21:08.049
Veracruz and his men are
on their way here right now.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.851
And with these roads,
we got about 30 minutes.

21:09.918 --> 21:11.786
Hey, can you be a sweetheart?
Grab these oxygen tanks.

21:11.854 --> 21:12.920
Wait,
I thought you said

21:12.988 --> 21:14.755
that Veracruz wasn't coming
until later.

21:14.823 --> 21:16.557
Yeah, he changed his mind.
Funny how that happens.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.259
Okay, what are y'all doing
with my stuff?

21:18.327 --> 21:20.728
Let me ask you -- do you have
a secret cache of weapons

21:20.796 --> 21:22.730
around here
that I don't know about?

21:22.798 --> 21:24.432
No, I don't have
a secret cache of weapons.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.533
Right.
I didn't think so.

21:25.601 --> 21:27.301
Here you go, kiddo.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.304
So, between, uh, these tanks
and the fuel out back,

21:30.372 --> 21:32.373
we should have just enough
to blow the place.

21:32.441 --> 21:33.808
What?! No! Whoa!
No, no, no!

21:33.876 --> 21:36.177
You're not going to
destroy the clinic!

21:36.245 --> 21:38.446
Isn't Veracruz coming
to do the same exact thing?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.181
No, Veracruz wants to
destroy the clinic

21:40.249 --> 21:41.482
with the people inside.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.117
I want to destroy the clinic

21:43.185 --> 21:44.485
to create a distraction
to save the people.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.753
Little bit
of a difference.

21:45.821 --> 21:47.655
Okay, this is insane.
No, you can't do this.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.257
Look, guys,
you can't really believe

21:49.324 --> 21:51.025
that Veracruz's guys
are not gonna see

21:51.093 --> 21:53.628
everybody leaving?
We got to cover our tracks.

21:53.695 --> 21:55.263
He's right, guys.
It's the best way.

21:55.330 --> 21:57.632
See? The teenage thief girl
agrees with me.

21:57.699 --> 22:00.268
Now, boys and girls,
this is happening.

22:00.335 --> 22:02.870
You stay here, you die.
You come with me...

22:02.938 --> 22:04.038
We live?

22:04.106 --> 22:05.806
Well, the odds
are a little better.

22:05.874 --> 22:07.141
So, look,
let's do this.

22:07.209 --> 22:08.843
Get the patients outside,
load them in the trucks,

22:08.911 --> 22:11.512
and let me know
if you see any bad guys.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.282
I can't believe
we're doing this.

22:14.349 --> 22:15.516
What about me?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.151
You and me are gonna build a bomb.
Oh.

22:17.219 --> 22:18.352
We're gonna
build a bomb.

22:20.022 --> 22:23.190
Okay, we got diesel, oxygen,
propane out back...

22:23.258 --> 22:24.559
The whatchamacallit

22:24.626 --> 22:26.227
that's my defibrillator.
Right.

22:26.295 --> 22:28.462
You wouldn't happen to have
any nitrous oxide, would you?

22:28.530 --> 22:31.632
No. We are a bush hospital.
Not a suburban dentist's office.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.067
Look, what am I supposed to
be doing here?

22:33.135 --> 22:35.002
Hold on. Okay, great.

22:35.070 --> 22:37.038
Take that.
This is your detonator.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.839
Yeah. That's gonna go --
okay.

22:38.907 --> 22:41.108
Tape that right on top of that valve.
Okay.

22:41.176 --> 22:44.679
Real quick -- the warning label
says "keep away --"

22:44.746 --> 22:46.547
Yeah. That's right.
We're building a bomb, okay?

22:46.615 --> 22:48.449
So you do the opposite of what
the warning label says.

23:02.030 --> 23:03.197
Hey, how we doing
out here?

23:03.265 --> 23:05.099
My God. She ran off,
and she won't stop crying.

23:07.569 --> 23:09.370
Hey, hey, sister.
Easy, now.

23:09.438 --> 23:10.705
Now, I'm not an expert here,
but I don't think

23:10.772 --> 23:11.906
that's how you get a kid
to stop crying.

23:25.554 --> 23:26.821
Sí. Blech!

23:34.262 --> 23:36.664
<i>Rápido, por favor.</i>

23:36.732 --> 23:37.665
Easy-peasy.

23:47.609 --> 23:49.677
Let's get the hell out of here.

23:49.745 --> 23:51.579
You set up everything
like I told you?

23:51.647 --> 23:53.114
Yes, yes, yes, I did --
I set my tank

23:53.181 --> 23:55.383
by the support beam at the front
just like you said.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.284
Are you sure you got it right?
We can only push this button once.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.819
No, I'm not sure
if I got it right.

23:58.887 --> 24:00.588
How am I supposed to
know if I got it right?

24:02.424 --> 24:05.793
Okay, people,
the second I hit this,

24:05.861 --> 24:07.294
that thing goes,
we got to be on the move.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.096
It's the smoke and the fire
that's gonna cover our escape.

24:13.402 --> 24:15.136
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.443
I didn't mean it that way.
New plan.

24:22.511 --> 24:24.512
A new plan? I got to trigger it manually.
What do you mean?

24:24.579 --> 24:26.313
Manually?
No, no, no, no, no!

24:26.381 --> 24:27.248
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Stay in the truck!

24:27.315 --> 24:29.483
No. Maybe I can fix it.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.484
Maybe I can --

24:47.536 --> 24:49.036
I guess you fixed it.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.179
What the hell did you do?
I maximized the pressure.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.814
Because you told me -- you told
me to maximize the pressure!

24:59.881 --> 25:01.215
Yeah, I know. I just didn't know
you were gonna do it so well.

25:01.283 --> 25:02.983
You got talent.

25:03.051 --> 25:04.752
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.020
We're safe, then.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.989
Oh, no.
We're a long way from safe.

25:16.811 --> 25:18.159
Uh, sorry to keep
you guys waiting.

25:19.245 --> 25:21.980
Uh, sir, do you know that they
locked me in my room last night?

25:22.048 --> 25:23.882
So I got to say, this is
starting to feel less and less

25:23.950 --> 25:25.417
like an "informal conversation."

25:25.484 --> 25:27.118
Still just an inquiry,
Commander.

25:27.186 --> 25:29.020
Although after
yesterday's testimony,

25:29.088 --> 25:30.722
I wouldn't make
any travel plans.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.425
Thanks for the heads-up.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.061
Now, amidst all the tales
of your heroics,

25:36.128 --> 25:39.164
we seem to have lost sight
of your initial mission,

25:39.232 --> 25:40.765
which is gathering intel

25:40.833 --> 25:43.168
on a terrorist organization
known as "Espada Ardiente."

25:43.236 --> 25:46.338
Right. I was just getting
to that, actually.

25:46.405 --> 25:50.976
So, after the unfortunate
sacrifice of the clinic,

25:51.043 --> 25:53.678
we all regrouped
a few miles up the road.

25:53.746 --> 25:55.513
Well, they're not after us
just yet.

25:55.581 --> 25:57.849
I'm guessing that by the time
they sort things out,

25:57.917 --> 26:00.085
we're gonna have
about an hour head start.

26:00.152 --> 26:03.421
An hour? All of that back there
bought us an hour?

26:03.489 --> 26:04.923
Is that supposed to
be good news?

26:04.991 --> 26:06.491
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

26:06.559 --> 26:08.393
It's better than a minute,
worse than a day.

26:08.461 --> 26:10.762
So in the meantime, we got to get
those folks someplace we can hide.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.265
The closest town
is Santa Rosa.

26:13.332 --> 26:15.734
Yes, yes. .
There's a clinic there.

26:15.801 --> 26:18.103
Yeah, unfortunately, we can't go
to the nearest town that has a clinic.

26:18.170 --> 26:20.372
It's the first place they're gonna be
looking for a bunch of sick people.

26:20.439 --> 26:22.040
They need medical
attention, okay?

26:22.108 --> 26:23.675
- Why don't we just drop them off?
- Well, you might as well

26:23.743 --> 26:25.310
hand them over to Veracruz
and save on gas.

26:25.378 --> 26:26.411
Now,
where else can we go?

26:26.479 --> 26:28.013
No place else.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.147
All the other
so-called villages

26:29.215 --> 26:31.383
are just a bunch of houses
and a church.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.952
I know a place.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.921
A camp, nearby.

26:35.988 --> 26:37.923
A camp? Whose camp?

26:37.990 --> 26:40.492
Espada Ardiente.

26:40.559 --> 26:42.627
Oh. Okay.

26:42.695 --> 26:44.529
Do you remember back when you
were just a hungry teenager

26:44.597 --> 26:46.064
who couldn't speak English?

26:46.132 --> 26:48.633
You said you'd never even heard
of the Espada Ardiente.

26:48.701 --> 26:50.135
I lied.

26:50.202 --> 26:52.737
They can help us.
They can hide the sick ones.

26:52.805 --> 26:54.606
You know what?

26:54.674 --> 26:57.242
I don't think
we have any other choice.

26:59.345 --> 27:01.746
Looks like we're going with
little miss terrorist here.

27:02.982 --> 27:05.550
Just to clarify,
Commander --

27:05.618 --> 27:06.985
you decided to join the group

27:07.053 --> 27:08.954
that you were sent to Colombia
to investigate?

27:09.021 --> 27:11.323
Well, "join" is kind of
a strong word, sir.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.091
I mean, uh,
we were in trouble,

27:13.159 --> 27:15.560
and there were not a lot
of options in the area.

27:15.628 --> 27:16.995
All right.

27:17.063 --> 27:19.564
And this Beatriz you mention.
I have no record of her.

27:19.632 --> 27:21.700
Well, that's not surprising.
She's a kid.

27:21.767 --> 27:24.135
She's a kid who led you
to a suspected terrorist camp.

27:24.203 --> 27:25.570
What do you want me to say?

27:25.638 --> 27:27.739
I mean, she was
a mystery to me, too.

27:27.807 --> 27:30.342
This kid --

27:30.409 --> 27:31.910
well, sir, you would understand
if you met her.

27:33.679 --> 27:36.648
Okay, so, um...

27:36.716 --> 27:39.217
Why am I the only one
wearing a blindfold?

27:39.285 --> 27:40.652
'Cause
I don't trust you.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.389
- You're a soldier.
- Oh, that's why.

27:44.457 --> 27:45.824
Do your parents know

27:45.891 --> 27:47.625
that you hang out
with the Espada Ardiente?

27:47.693 --> 27:49.861
- Don't talk about my parents!
- Okay. Hey. Easy.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.630
You know, what I'm
trying to say is this --

27:52.698 --> 27:54.199
most girls your age

27:54.266 --> 27:56.835
are into, you know,
makeup and stuff, malls.

27:56.902 --> 27:58.703
Do you see any shopping malls
around here?

27:58.771 --> 28:00.572
Uh, no.
You blindfolded me, remember?

28:00.639 --> 28:02.874
There are none.
So no more questions.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.876
Okay, look,
I'm not trying to pry.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.512
I'm just curious how you
hooked up with these guys.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.648
They're my friends.

28:10.716 --> 28:12.584
Okay.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.252
So, how much longer
till we get to your friends?

28:14.320 --> 28:15.487
I got to get my hands

28:15.554 --> 28:17.389
on their communications
equipment and call in.

28:19.025 --> 28:22.427
Uncover your eyes.
We're here.

28:31.203 --> 28:33.405
You got to be kidding.

28:37.076 --> 28:38.443
This?

28:38.511 --> 28:40.612
This is
the Espada Ardiente?

28:40.679 --> 28:42.147
Yes.
Is there a problem?

28:42.214 --> 28:43.615
What -- well, this is,
like, 12 guys.

28:43.682 --> 28:45.050
I was hoping
for some kind of army

28:45.117 --> 28:47.619
or something to keep us
from getting massacred.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.054
Look, Espada Ardiente is --
and what does that mean, anyway?

28:49.121 --> 28:50.522
"Flaming"
something or other.

28:50.589 --> 28:52.023
"Sword"!
You don't understand!

28:52.091 --> 28:55.026
"Ardiente" means
fearless, passionate.

28:55.094 --> 28:56.528
We burn to defeat
our enemies.

28:56.595 --> 28:58.530
Right, okay. I got it.
The "flaming sword."

28:58.597 --> 29:00.098
So what if they're small?

29:00.166 --> 29:01.733
We can fight
just as hard as anyone!

29:01.801 --> 29:03.902
Look, I hate to cut
your speech short, sweetheart.

29:03.969 --> 29:07.405
But you know what?
The size of your army matters.

29:07.473 --> 29:09.274
Okay?
It matters a lot.

29:09.341 --> 29:13.011
I mean, you're not gonna win
a war with a flock of sheep.

29:13.079 --> 29:14.345
Look, it's all
about firepower.

29:14.413 --> 29:15.814
Do these guys
have any equipment?

29:15.881 --> 29:17.582
Most of our men
have hunting rifles.

29:17.650 --> 29:18.850
Ammunition is low,
but --

29:18.918 --> 29:20.452
You're not making me feel
any better, here, kid.

29:20.519 --> 29:21.686
Or how about experience?

29:21.754 --> 29:23.188
Some of them
were in the army.

29:23.255 --> 29:25.824
And our best fighter
is Luis.

29:25.891 --> 29:26.791
Oh,
the big guy there?

29:28.461 --> 29:30.128
No.
The one next to him.

29:32.798 --> 29:34.399
Wonderful.

29:36.001 --> 29:39.037
These guys took out a truck
full of paramilitary troops?

29:39.105 --> 29:41.039
How do you figure that?

29:41.107 --> 29:43.174
Luis shot the tires out of their truck,
and it went down the hill.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.576
They killed his goats!

29:44.643 --> 29:47.745
His -- his goats?
You're serious?

29:47.813 --> 29:49.447
Your best fighter
is a goat herder?!

29:49.515 --> 29:52.150
Goat herders? Really?

30:03.729 --> 30:06.498
<i>Ihola! Ihola!</i>

30:18.244 --> 30:20.311
Ben.

30:20.379 --> 30:23.047
Oh, no. Is her cough back?
Let me see.

30:23.115 --> 30:25.783
Okay, so,
I did a little recon,

30:25.851 --> 30:28.019
gathered a little intel.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.320
First thing --

30:29.388 --> 30:30.855
you really shouldn't call them
filthy goat herders.

30:30.923 --> 30:32.290
I didn't call them filthy.

30:32.358 --> 30:34.325
And the only reason I called
the one guy a goat herder

30:34.393 --> 30:37.762
is 'cause he has goats
and he herds them.

30:37.830 --> 30:40.365
Yeah. They're farmers.

30:40.432 --> 30:42.834
Anyway, seems their land
is valuable

30:42.902 --> 30:45.537
as some sort of drug transport
to the coast.

30:45.604 --> 30:48.373
So someone paid off Veracruz
to force them out.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.708
They fought back,
got lucky a few times --

30:50.776 --> 30:52.343
and Veracruz thought they were
bigger than they actually were.

30:52.411 --> 30:53.645
Pretty much.

30:53.712 --> 30:58.183
Okay, listen.
Guys, she's got malaria.

30:58.250 --> 31:01.719
Okay, and without the right
medicine, she could die soon.

31:01.787 --> 31:03.621
Look, I'm tap-dancing
as fast as I can here.

31:03.689 --> 31:05.490
I'm just trying to keep
everybody breathing.

31:05.558 --> 31:08.526
Me too, man.
Me too.

31:18.204 --> 31:20.071
The man wants to know
why your pants are blue.

31:20.139 --> 31:23.174
The jungle is green.

31:23.242 --> 31:25.376
Please tell the man that
I don't want to talk about it.

31:30.716 --> 31:32.517
So,
what's with Beatriz?

31:32.585 --> 31:35.520
She seems to have,
uh, anger issues.

31:35.588 --> 31:37.155
It's, uh, kind of par
for the course

31:37.223 --> 31:39.157
when you see your father shot
in front of you.

31:39.225 --> 31:42.460
And she wandered
into the Espada Ardiente camp

31:42.528 --> 31:44.696
the next day,
and they took her in.

31:44.763 --> 31:47.799
So she's, what,
the mascot?

31:47.866 --> 31:49.834
Yeah.
Something like that.

31:49.902 --> 31:51.970
Oh, uh, one more thing.
You have a new name in camp.

31:52.037 --> 31:54.872
"La barbilla."

31:54.940 --> 31:56.007
"Barbilla."
What's that again?

31:56.075 --> 31:58.209
Um, "barbarian"
or something?

31:58.277 --> 32:01.112
No. "The chin."

32:05.050 --> 32:09.120
The chin.
Doesn't make any sense.

32:23.736 --> 32:25.403
They train every morning.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.272
It's the same thing
they do in the army.

32:29.174 --> 32:31.376
I'm pretty sure in the army
they fire their guns.

32:31.443 --> 32:32.810
You think that's funny?
Are you laughing at them?

32:32.878 --> 32:34.646
No, I don't think
it's funny, kid.

32:34.713 --> 32:36.447
I think
it's anything but.

32:36.515 --> 32:38.249
But is is not an army.
They got no training.

32:38.317 --> 32:40.418
Luis there
is about 100 years old.

32:40.486 --> 32:42.487
Don't even get me started
on the big guy there.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.924
They need weapons!
And I know you can help them!

32:46.992 --> 32:48.926
I saw you back at the clinic,
and you made those explosives.

32:48.994 --> 32:51.462
They need more than weapons.
Trust me -- in a real fight,

32:51.530 --> 32:53.031
these chumps
would get slaughtered.

32:53.098 --> 32:55.533
Aah!

32:55.601 --> 32:59.470
Hey. Just having
a conversation here.

32:59.538 --> 33:00.938
Nothing to look at.

33:01.006 --> 33:02.140
Everything's cool.

33:02.207 --> 33:04.142
Now, look, I'm sorry
about your dad, okay?

33:04.209 --> 33:06.311
And I'm sure that your flaming
sword buddies are very brave.

33:06.378 --> 33:11.449
But believe me -- brave guys
bleed just like everybody else.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.591
What do you think?

33:20.659 --> 33:23.094
Uh, the truth?
They need help more than we do.

33:23.162 --> 33:25.897
A-and so what does that mean?
Are we -- are we stuck here?

33:25.964 --> 33:28.266
No, it means I got to figure out
a way to call back to my C.O.,

33:28.334 --> 33:29.834
get him
to shut Veracruz down.

33:29.902 --> 33:31.169
All right.
We've been over this.

33:31.236 --> 33:33.738
There isn't a phone
for 200 miles from here.

33:33.806 --> 33:35.106
Veracruz
has a sat phone.

33:35.174 --> 33:37.475
Yeah, but, wait.
You can't go back to Veracruz.

33:37.543 --> 33:39.077
Well, why not?
I mean, right now he thinks

33:39.144 --> 33:40.945
I've been kidnapped
by our new friends there.

33:41.013 --> 33:42.880
I'll just go back and tell him I escaped.
Oh, yeah.

33:42.948 --> 33:45.249
And he's gonna be like, "oh, my
God, it's so good to see you,"

33:45.317 --> 33:47.485
and hug you
and shoot you in the head.

33:47.553 --> 33:49.354
No, I doubt it. He needs me
to help him sell the story

33:49.421 --> 33:50.788
about the flaming sword.

33:50.856 --> 33:53.191
Should be enough
to call out.

33:53.258 --> 33:54.359
Hey.

33:55.828 --> 33:56.994
What if you're wrong?

33:57.062 --> 33:58.763
Well, then, I get shot,

33:58.831 --> 34:01.232
and you try your luck
with the goat herders.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.603
Try it!

34:16.306 --> 34:18.607
Okay, uh, better get going.

34:18.675 --> 34:20.943
I want to get to Veracruz
before he makes camp.

34:21.010 --> 34:22.411
Before you go,
I want to ask you something.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.714
Are you really
gonna do this?

34:25.782 --> 34:27.882
Are you really gonna
go for help?

34:27.951 --> 34:30.385
Yeah,
it's like I told you.

34:30.453 --> 34:32.821
- I'm gonna go back, make a call --
- People say a lot of things.

34:34.690 --> 34:36.992
Now, I just got everybody out
of the clinic safe, didn't I?

34:37.060 --> 34:38.560
I mean, what does a guy
have to do

34:38.628 --> 34:40.094
to get some credibility
around here?

34:40.163 --> 34:41.929
I've been in hot spots
all over the globe.

34:41.998 --> 34:45.434
And when things first get rough,
everyone's a hero.

34:45.501 --> 34:49.571
And then reality sets in,
and promises are broken.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.909
And if you let these people
down, I want you to know

34:54.978 --> 34:57.846
that I will personally find you
and kick your teeth in.

35:00.683 --> 35:04.052
Amanda, I'm not gonna
let anybody down.

35:05.722 --> 35:07.756
I may get my ass shot off,
but...

35:07.824 --> 35:09.024
My teeth are safe.

35:09.092 --> 35:10.225
Before we move on,

35:10.293 --> 35:11.460
Espada Ardiente's leadership

35:11.527 --> 35:14.162
consisted of this man,
Louis Mendez,

35:14.230 --> 35:16.265
of the Colombian
armed forces.

35:16.332 --> 35:17.866
His name was Luis.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.635
And, yeah,
that looks like him...

35:19.702 --> 35:20.903
About 100 years ago.

35:20.970 --> 35:22.204
He looks good
in uniform.

35:23.973 --> 35:28.043
Did you gather any more intel
on their command structure?

35:28.111 --> 35:29.511
They were farmers.

35:29.579 --> 35:31.046
They didn't have command
structures. They had sheep.

35:31.114 --> 35:32.447
Why do you think I was going
to get some help?

35:32.515 --> 35:35.250
Okay. Fine.

35:35.318 --> 35:38.020
We'll come back to that.

35:38.087 --> 35:39.488
What happened
after you left?

35:39.555 --> 35:42.624
Well, I drove back
toward Veracruz.

35:42.692 --> 35:44.059
I mean, I knew
his team's drill well enough

35:44.127 --> 35:45.494
to find a scout or two.

35:47.096 --> 35:51.867
<i>Once I got to the neighborhood,
I ditched the truck,</i>

35:51.935 --> 35:55.704
<i>put on a little
kidnapping makeup...</i>

36:00.977 --> 36:02.978
<i>...And hoofed it
until I ran into a couple</i>

36:03.046 --> 36:05.714
<i>of Veracruz's scouts.</i>

36:28.271 --> 36:32.240
Oh, man. It was horrible.

36:32.308 --> 36:35.477
They were working me over,
asking all kinds of things.

36:35.545 --> 36:36.945
How did you escape?

36:37.013 --> 36:38.380
I was lucky.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.649
<i>They only sent a couple guys
with me to el baño,</i>

36:40.717 --> 36:42.351
and I managed to run off.

36:42.418 --> 36:43.819
We searched for you
everywhere.

36:43.886 --> 36:45.754
When the terrorists blew up
the clinic, we feared the worst.

36:45.822 --> 36:47.589
It wasn't "the worst," but
it was still pretty damn bad.

36:47.657 --> 36:48.790
You know
they were setting up

36:48.858 --> 36:50.092
to give me the
car-battery treatment?

36:50.159 --> 36:51.526
These guys
are frickin' monsters!

36:51.594 --> 36:52.894
Yes, they are.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.730
Now you see why we need your
help fighting this menace.

36:54.797 --> 36:58.500
100%. I say we track them down
and light these bastards up.

36:58.568 --> 37:01.803
Excellent. Good to have you
back, Commander Axe.

37:09.912 --> 37:12.881
We need help. Okay?
Asap!

37:12.949 --> 37:15.484
Okay, Commander.
I understand.

37:15.551 --> 37:17.552
But let me ask you this --

37:17.620 --> 37:19.688
how the hell
did this happen?!

37:19.756 --> 37:21.623
You're supposed to be down there
observing and reporting,

37:21.691 --> 37:22.824
not starting
some guerilla war!

37:22.892 --> 37:24.459
Well, I observed
the sons of bitches

37:24.527 --> 37:26.294
trying to kill me
and massacre hospital,

37:26.362 --> 37:27.763
and I'm reporting it.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.431
All right, look,
I'll make some calls.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.066
But, Axe, if this
is some cheap ploy

37:31.134 --> 37:32.634
to get yourself
pulled out of there...

37:32.702 --> 37:33.935
It's not about me.

37:34.003 --> 37:36.171
Now, you help these people,
I will gladly let you

37:36.239 --> 37:38.707
kick my butt at a time
and place of your choosing.

37:38.775 --> 37:41.009
But, please, for the love
of God -- I got to go.

37:42.445 --> 37:45.547
Axe.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.717
The men are ready.
We should start looking

37:48.785 --> 37:51.086
for the terrorists before
they have time to move.

37:51.154 --> 37:54.056
Yes, we should. Time for a
little payback, am I right?

37:56.292 --> 37:58.894
<i>So, at this point, I was just
trying to run out the clock.</i>

37:58.961 --> 38:01.430
<i>I had to give the guys
from the flaming sword</i>

38:01.497 --> 38:02.931
<i>enough time to get their truck</i>

38:02.999 --> 38:04.433
<i>off the road
and back to their camp.</i>

38:06.102 --> 38:08.804
<i>And I needed
to keep Veracruz's men busy</i>

38:08.871 --> 38:10.372
<i>long enough for help to arrive.</i>

38:10.440 --> 38:13.108
Yep. Pretty sure
we're going this way.

38:13.176 --> 38:14.609
But, no.

38:14.677 --> 38:17.245
That's not --
that's not it.

38:44.774 --> 38:47.576
<i>Iperfecto! Iexactamente!</i>

39:02.525 --> 39:04.359
Ah.

39:07.263 --> 39:08.997
What is the delay?

39:09.065 --> 39:10.832
Uh, well, I was just
talking to your boys here.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.033
I was telling them
that the --

39:12.101 --> 39:13.268
the camp
is pretty much up there.

39:13.336 --> 39:16.304
See the tire tracks here?

39:16.372 --> 39:17.572
This is the same tread as
their vehicles that they use.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.341
Yes, I can see.

39:19.408 --> 39:21.810
You are
an excellent tracker.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.313
You are also
an excellent liar.

39:28.117 --> 39:29.651
What the hell
are you doing?

39:29.719 --> 39:31.620
I just spoke with
Department Governor Perez.

39:31.687 --> 39:34.656
His men intercepted your call
an hour ago.

39:34.724 --> 39:36.858
Ay.

39:36.926 --> 39:39.194
I am hurt you think
so little of me.

39:39.262 --> 39:41.997
You honestly thought I would
take no precautions?

39:42.064 --> 39:44.633
Hey, come on.

39:44.700 --> 39:48.003
This is just a misunderstanding.
No.

39:48.638 --> 39:52.841
No, I don't think
it is a misunderstanding.

39:52.909 --> 39:56.077
I think I understand
very well.

39:57.513 --> 39:59.748
Now...

39:59.815 --> 40:01.850
Show me where they are
on the map.

40:06.289 --> 40:08.256
You know, why should I?
You're gonna kill me anyway.

40:08.324 --> 40:09.524
I might.

40:11.394 --> 40:14.429
And...I might not.

40:14.497 --> 40:16.398
The question is whether
you want to die here,

40:16.465 --> 40:18.900
or keep breathing
a bit longer

40:18.968 --> 40:21.203
and hope you prove useful enough
to save.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.040
Show me
where their camp is.

40:25.107 --> 40:26.641
If you are wrong...

40:26.709 --> 40:29.644
I'll put a bullet
in your brain,

40:29.712 --> 40:30.946
and maybe that
will help you remember.

40:33.549 --> 40:35.383
Uh, well,
come to think of it,

40:35.451 --> 40:39.654
that -- that mountain range
does look familiar.

41:21.998 --> 41:25.800
So, how does it feel to be saved
by filthy goat herders?

41:25.868 --> 41:28.236
Well, I owe you one, kid.
Let's go.

41:28.304 --> 41:30.839
No, no, no, no. Not until you
promise not to insult them again.

41:34.410 --> 41:36.044
Say what?

41:36.112 --> 41:38.079
- Promise.
- Oh, for God's sake. Okay, I promise.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.382
They're the greatest
part-time farmer army ever!

41:40.449 --> 41:41.383
Can we go?!

41:41.450 --> 41:42.517
Geez!

41:48.391 --> 41:52.093
Aah!

42:05.472 --> 42:06.927
So, Veracruz saw
through your plan?

42:06.931 --> 42:08.198
Oh, and it gets better.

42:08.265 --> 42:09.866
Veracruz is looking around,
and he's close.

42:09.934 --> 42:11.968
He's gonna find us
within 24 hours, tops.

42:12.036 --> 42:15.505
Ok-- okay.
So what am I supposed to do?

42:15.573 --> 42:17.407
Because I got an old house
full of sick people --

42:17.475 --> 42:19.398
there's a CIA outpost
about 50 miles away.

42:19.399 --> 42:20.401
50?

42:20.426 --> 42:22.728
The pilot who brought me down
here told me about it.

42:22.852 --> 42:24.987
I think
it's our best bet.

42:25.074 --> 42:26.341
50 miles.
Are you on drugs?

42:26.409 --> 42:29.477
Do they do testing
for soldiers?

42:29.545 --> 42:32.647
<i>Because we can't get all
of these people 50 yards.</i>

42:32.715 --> 42:34.182
I understand that.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.918
Kid, can I talk to you
for a second?

42:36.986 --> 42:38.219
What?

42:40.389 --> 42:42.357
I want to
ask you something.

42:42.425 --> 42:44.559
How did you end up
with these guys,

42:44.627 --> 42:46.695
speaking English
like you do?

42:46.762 --> 42:48.096
What do you care?

42:48.164 --> 42:50.131
Well, because
we're in a tough spot,

42:50.199 --> 42:53.001
and I'd like to know
who I'm dealing with.

42:55.004 --> 42:57.138
My father
was a journalist.

42:57.206 --> 43:00.308
<i>From El Espectador
in Bogotá.</i>

43:00.376 --> 43:01.743
He was in this area,

43:01.811 --> 43:03.611
reporting on the situation
with the farmers.

43:03.679 --> 43:05.647
That's what
got him shot?

43:05.715 --> 43:07.549
Yes.

43:07.616 --> 43:10.785
I knew Luis from the interviews
my father did.

43:13.255 --> 43:17.559
I didn't know where else to go
a-after my father died.

43:17.626 --> 43:22.464
So Luis brought me to the camp,
and he let me stay.

43:22.531 --> 43:26.301
I'm glad he did.

43:26.368 --> 43:28.069
I need your help.

43:28.137 --> 43:29.938
I got to put this little army
together.

43:30.005 --> 43:32.340
But there's a problem --
those guys hate me,

43:32.408 --> 43:34.042
and I speak Spanish
like a third grader.

43:34.110 --> 43:37.479
But they like you, and you speak
English like a champ.

43:37.546 --> 43:39.681
<i>So...
Por favor?</i>

43:42.651 --> 43:44.986
Talk to them.

43:45.054 --> 43:47.489
And if I like what you have
to say, I will translate it.

43:47.556 --> 43:49.924
Esteemed gentlemen
of the flaming sword...

43:49.992 --> 43:52.494
It's not "flaming" sword!

43:52.561 --> 43:55.663
Oh, God, forget it.
Just talk. Just talk.

43:55.731 --> 43:58.733
I know we didn't get off
to a great start.

44:01.137 --> 44:02.403
I made some mistakes.

44:04.140 --> 44:05.240
You made some mistakes.

44:06.709 --> 44:10.578
Then there was
the whole goat-herd business.

44:10.646 --> 44:13.748
It's not like
it didn't happen.

44:13.816 --> 44:16.718
But that's behind us.

44:16.786 --> 44:18.753
Now, I'm a soldier.

44:18.821 --> 44:20.288
And I've got
all the training

44:20.356 --> 44:21.523
and a fistful
of combat ribbons.

44:23.959 --> 44:25.794
But today -- what?

44:25.861 --> 44:27.762
Stick with me.
Okay.

44:27.830 --> 44:31.533
But today I damn near
got my brains blown out.

44:33.702 --> 44:36.471
And the only reason why
I'm still breathing is because of you.

44:44.213 --> 44:46.014
And that made me
realize something.

44:48.417 --> 44:50.018
If we're gonna
save ourselves...

44:51.253 --> 44:52.387
...And give Veracruz

44:52.454 --> 44:55.123
the ass-whipping
he so richly deserves...

45:00.095 --> 45:03.131
Was that what I said?

45:03.199 --> 45:06.034
The point is that
we need to do it together.

45:07.770 --> 45:10.405
So I'm standing here
before you today

45:10.472 --> 45:11.739
to ask for your help.

45:14.009 --> 45:16.878
Now, I've got a plan,

45:16.946 --> 45:19.147
but it is not gonna fly
without you.

45:20.749 --> 45:22.417
So I need to know
right now...

45:24.053 --> 45:25.220
...Are you with me?!

45:38.234 --> 45:40.735
Espada Ardiente.

45:40.803 --> 45:42.770
Espada Ardiente!

45:44.573 --> 45:47.675
Okay,
now let's get training,

45:47.743 --> 45:48.877
'cause, man,
we got to get organized.

45:48.944 --> 45:50.478
Wait right there. Stop.

45:50.546 --> 45:53.081
You're saying that you were
training the terrorist group?

45:53.148 --> 45:55.683
Did you train them?
Yes or no?

45:55.751 --> 45:58.620
Did you work with this man,
Louis Mendez?

45:58.687 --> 46:00.655
Yeah, look, Luis was one
of the guys. He was on --

46:00.723 --> 46:02.056
He was the senior operative

46:02.124 --> 46:04.225
in the Colombian military
in the 1980s

46:04.293 --> 46:06.527
until he disappeared,
presumably, to start this group!

46:06.595 --> 46:10.398
And now you're giving this man
military secrets and training?

46:10.466 --> 46:12.500
All I can say, sir, is the only
secrets I gave away

46:12.568 --> 46:14.135
were the secrets
of the Analee High School

46:14.203 --> 46:16.104
J.V. football squad.

46:16.171 --> 46:18.740
Okay, guys.
Listen up and listen good.

46:18.807 --> 46:20.008
These are the plans
for battle.

46:21.777 --> 46:24.646
This first one here
is called the nickel defense.

46:26.515 --> 46:29.717
If things get rough...

46:29.785 --> 46:31.219
...The scouts fall back.

46:33.188 --> 46:37.325
This last one is called
the prevent defense.

46:39.361 --> 46:42.230
Why is that?

46:42.298 --> 46:44.399
They've all fallen back.

46:48.037 --> 46:50.471
What the hell's
their problem?

46:50.539 --> 46:52.407
All of these plans
are for retreating!

46:52.474 --> 46:54.242
The men want to know what's
the plan for an attack!

46:54.310 --> 46:55.777
No, they don't
need to know that one.

46:55.844 --> 46:58.313
See, we're just trying to
keep them in the game. Mondo.

46:59.214 --> 47:01.215
You're killing me.

47:01.283 --> 47:03.284
Okay, I have a plan
for attack.

47:04.887 --> 47:06.521
It's called
the "zone blitz."

47:08.290 --> 47:10.525
And it's all about disguise.
Let's hear you say it.

47:10.592 --> 47:12.794
All together.
"Zone blitz!"

47:12.861 --> 47:14.762
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!

47:14.830 --> 47:15.830
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!

47:15.898 --> 47:17.031
Now let's just hope to God

47:17.099 --> 47:18.766
you never have to
say those words again.

47:18.834 --> 47:21.102
<i>Next day, we moved out
with the patients in one truck,</i>

47:21.170 --> 47:23.204
<i>and the flaming sword guys
packed in the others.</i>

47:23.272 --> 47:25.573
<i>It was only 50 miles, but when
the whole country is a mountain,</i>

47:25.641 --> 47:27.008
<i>miles are kind of
like dog years --</i>

47:27.076 --> 47:28.943
<i>every one more like seven.</i>

47:29.011 --> 47:30.812
<i>And, of course,
there's the worst part</i>

47:30.879 --> 47:34.415
<i>of driving to a CIA outpost --
it's not gonna be on the map.</i>

47:34.483 --> 47:37.051
Quick update --
I didn't run away.

47:37.119 --> 47:38.486
I went to get help,
just like I said.

47:38.554 --> 47:40.621
Yes, and you almost
got yourself killed.

47:40.689 --> 47:42.290
That should
count double, then.

47:42.358 --> 47:43.758
Uh, why would it
count double?

47:43.826 --> 47:44.993
It only counts double

47:45.060 --> 47:46.961
if you actually come back
with some help.

47:47.029 --> 47:48.763
If you nearly die
a senseless death,

47:48.831 --> 47:49.931
that counts as,
like, half.

47:49.999 --> 47:51.165
Okay. Half.
Thank you.

47:51.233 --> 47:52.934
You're welcome.

47:53.002 --> 47:55.737
Okay, so,
tell me something.

47:55.804 --> 47:59.841
Do-gooder...
Food-aid worker...

47:59.908 --> 48:02.076
I mean, why so cynical?

48:02.144 --> 48:04.212
If you're asking that,
you probably haven't spent

48:04.279 --> 48:05.847
a whole lot of time
around aid workers.

48:05.914 --> 48:07.949
Okay.

48:09.752 --> 48:11.319
Well, I mean,
you get into this

48:11.387 --> 48:13.788
because you want to make
the world a better place,

48:13.856 --> 48:16.057
and it turns out
that there's a lot of people

48:16.125 --> 48:17.792
who want to make it
a worse place.

48:17.860 --> 48:20.728
And we're outnumbered.
By a lot.

48:20.796 --> 48:22.296
By soldiers, you mean?

48:22.364 --> 48:24.499
Not just soldiers.

48:24.566 --> 48:26.834
But usually, when there are
people are going hungry,

48:26.902 --> 48:29.103
there's some guy with a gun
making it happen.

48:31.940 --> 48:33.608
Speaking of hunger,
you haven't been eating.

48:33.675 --> 48:34.876
Why is that?

48:34.943 --> 48:36.744
These guys need it more than me.
Believe me.

48:36.812 --> 48:39.247
I figure it this way --
if we make it,

48:39.314 --> 48:41.082
I got a head start on
the 10 pounds I want to lose,

48:41.150 --> 48:45.053
and if we don't, well,
dead guys don't get hungry.

48:49.258 --> 48:51.125
You're not like
the other soldiers I've met,

48:51.193 --> 48:52.293
Commander Axe.

48:52.361 --> 48:53.361
I'll give you that.

48:53.429 --> 48:56.030
Call me Sam.

48:56.098 --> 48:58.433
Sam it is.

49:00.302 --> 49:01.669
I know that you want me
to kiss you right now.

49:01.737 --> 49:03.438
- And, believe me, I would love to.
- What?

49:03.505 --> 49:05.239
But I'm just saying,
it's a bad time, is all.

49:05.307 --> 49:06.808
- No, no.
- Any other time, I'd be all over it.

49:06.875 --> 49:08.476
<i>Oh. No comprende.
Seriously.</i>

49:08.544 --> 49:10.545
I was just making
conversation here.

49:10.612 --> 49:13.414
That's what that was.

49:14.983 --> 49:18.219
Yeah, just drive.

49:18.287 --> 49:21.956
<i>For the record,
she wanted me to kiss her.</i>

49:22.024 --> 49:23.658
<i>So, anyway, we keep going.</i>

49:31.400 --> 49:32.900
<i>So, as we're getting
to the main roads</i>

49:32.968 --> 49:35.536
<i>out of the mountains,
I'm getting that itchy feeling,</i>

49:35.604 --> 49:37.171
<i>an itchy feeling
that just keeps getting worse.</i>

49:45.414 --> 49:47.181
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.

49:50.285 --> 49:51.285
Hey.

49:51.353 --> 49:52.687
Uh, okay.
This is not good.

49:52.754 --> 49:54.122
No, no.
This is just rain.

49:54.189 --> 49:55.923
Okay? It doesn't take much
to start a rock slide.

49:55.991 --> 49:58.426
You always see fallen rocks
and trees in the road.

49:58.494 --> 50:00.061
Yeah, well, I don't see
a lot of trees or rocks.

50:00.129 --> 50:03.364
I just see this tree here

50:03.432 --> 50:06.100
right in the middle of
a hard-to-defend position.

50:06.168 --> 50:08.002
- A hard-to-def--
- Yeah.

50:08.070 --> 50:09.370
What do you propose we do?

50:09.438 --> 50:10.972
Back those trucks up
and proceed with caution.

50:11.039 --> 50:12.673
Oscar can clear it.

50:12.741 --> 50:13.875
Hold on a second, okay?

50:13.942 --> 50:16.043
I don't think that thing
fell by itself.

50:16.111 --> 50:17.845
The sooner we cut the tree,
the sooner we can go.

50:19.581 --> 50:21.115
It's fine. It's fine.

50:27.656 --> 50:30.725
<i>So, while they're clearing
this tree from the road,</i>

50:30.792 --> 50:32.727
<i>I'm getting a real bad feeling,</i>

50:32.794 --> 50:35.997
<i>one of those "too quiet,
I don't like this place,</i>

50:36.064 --> 50:38.900
<i>something weird is going on"
feelings.</i>

50:38.967 --> 50:41.736
You, uh...
You might want to stay here.

50:47.242 --> 50:48.809
<i>Now, I know, of course,</i>

50:48.877 --> 50:51.345
<i>that there's a fine line
between caution and paranoia.</i>

50:51.413 --> 50:53.247
<i>People tell you about
gut feelings all the time.</i>

50:53.315 --> 50:55.082
<i>But if you follow
every gut feeling,</i>

50:55.150 --> 50:56.684
<i>you never get anything done.</i>

50:56.752 --> 51:01.923
<i>Still, sometimes something
feels funny for a reason.</i>

51:06.161 --> 51:09.830
They know we're here.
What?

51:09.898 --> 51:12.133
They know we're here!
Prevent defense!

51:12.201 --> 51:13.534
Aah!

51:17.773 --> 51:19.006
No!

51:24.613 --> 51:25.613
Aah!

51:29.785 --> 51:30.851
Luis!

51:39.861 --> 51:41.495
- Hey, help me with something.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?

51:41.563 --> 51:43.364
Look, those guys
are just scouts, okay?

51:43.432 --> 51:46.067
They're trying to keep us here
until reinforcements show up.

51:46.134 --> 51:48.502
So we got to block that
switchback down there before --

51:48.570 --> 51:51.072
<i>well, before that.</i>

51:51.139 --> 51:53.574
Yeah, here they are,
right on time. Come on.

52:08.657 --> 52:09.790
Push! Push!

52:16.832 --> 52:18.899
<i>Push now! Ivamonos!</i>

52:20.836 --> 52:21.802
Aah!

52:35.517 --> 52:37.118
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

52:37.185 --> 52:40.288
Very groovy! Come on, guys!

52:40.355 --> 52:43.491
Okay, go, go, go.
We got to go. Got to go.

52:55.058 --> 52:57.548
Now listen everybody.
We got lucky back there.

52:57.570 --> 53:00.105
Those guys got excited, and
they made a lot of mistakes,

53:00.173 --> 53:01.607
but it's not gonna
happen again.

53:06.079 --> 53:07.913
So we got to move,
and we got to move fast.

53:10.350 --> 53:12.050
Now, if this map
is not garbage,

53:12.118 --> 53:14.052
we are close
to a CIA outpost.

53:16.523 --> 53:18.857
We can get there by nightfall
if we hurry.

53:22.295 --> 53:24.930
Understand, señor?
All right, let's go.

53:28.668 --> 53:30.002
Can we talk?

53:30.069 --> 53:31.937
Ah, listen, you know,
about before, it's --

53:32.005 --> 53:33.172
Oh,
you're talking about --

53:33.239 --> 53:35.007
No, I'm not talking
about that, actually.

53:35.074 --> 53:36.475
If you want to
embarrass yourself

53:36.543 --> 53:38.210
with your fantasies,
knock yourself out.

53:38.278 --> 53:39.344
What I want to know is...

53:39.412 --> 53:41.313
Once we get there,
what happens?

53:41.381 --> 53:42.507
Well, maybe you haven't
been paying attention.

53:42.508 --> 53:43.713
We get there, we get help.

53:43.716 --> 53:45.384
Oh, so it's as simple
as that.

53:45.451 --> 53:47.186
Who said it was
gonna be simple?

53:51.524 --> 53:53.358
<i>So, we used
what head start we had,</i>

53:53.426 --> 53:55.460
<i>but it was pretty slowgoing.</i>

53:55.528 --> 53:57.129
<i>In those mountains,
the good roads are bad,</i>

53:57.197 --> 54:00.966
<i>and the bad roads, well,
they aren't really even roads.</i>

54:01.034 --> 54:02.334
This is ridiculous.

54:02.402 --> 54:04.369
I can't even tell which way
north is anymore.

54:04.437 --> 54:05.871
You're sure that it's here?

54:05.939 --> 54:07.639
- Yeah, it's around here somewhere, yeah.
- Really?

54:07.707 --> 54:10.242
Because there's nothing
on this map that says --

54:10.310 --> 54:12.711
we are looking for a secret
intelligence facility.

54:12.779 --> 54:13.979
They don't put them
on maps.

54:14.047 --> 54:15.380
That's how you know
they're secret.

54:15.448 --> 54:16.848
Right, right,
right, right, right.

54:16.916 --> 54:18.450
But isn't it possible
that this guy

54:18.518 --> 54:19.985
that told you about it
is wrong?

54:20.053 --> 54:22.054
- Because honestly --
- Okay, there it is. Right there.

54:24.791 --> 54:26.024
Now, you want to check it out,
or should we just

54:26.092 --> 54:28.794
chalk this up to my imagination
and go home?

54:28.861 --> 54:32.364
But do -- do we just knock,
or is...?

54:32.432 --> 54:33.198
<i>Now you want to kiss me.</i>

54:35.301 --> 54:38.770
This isn't some kind of joke,
is it?

54:38.838 --> 54:39.972
I don't joke
about mass murder.

54:40.039 --> 54:41.473
It's kind of
a touchy subject with me.

54:41.541 --> 54:43.575
So, guys, what can we do, here?
You got any weapons?

54:43.643 --> 54:44.876
We got a couple .45s
and a --

54:44.944 --> 54:46.411
you know,
and, like, a box of ammo.

54:46.479 --> 54:48.680
Other than that, we've got,
like, a lot of computers.

54:48.748 --> 54:51.116
We got maps.
DVDs. Some good movies.

54:51.184 --> 54:52.884
We're an observation outpost.
Observing.

54:52.952 --> 54:55.420
Yeah, doing
communications support and...

54:55.488 --> 54:57.522
Not wearing night goggles
going on raids.

54:57.590 --> 54:59.424
We're not a fortress.

54:59.492 --> 55:01.460
Okay, what about all the antennas
on the roof? Can you call out?

55:01.527 --> 55:02.928
Yeah, yeah.
We can do that.

55:02.996 --> 55:04.263
Well, get on it, then.
We need help right now.

55:05.965 --> 55:07.165
What you got, medicine-wise?

55:07.233 --> 55:09.668
Yeah, we'd call that
"not much."

55:09.736 --> 55:11.803
Okay, hold on, now.
It's better than nothing.

55:11.871 --> 55:14.172
I told you, man.
It's just us out here.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.441
I mean, its me, Gabe,
and the donkey.

55:16.509 --> 55:18.410
Donkey?
The burro.

55:18.478 --> 55:20.379
We take her into town
for supplies and water,

55:20.446 --> 55:22.614
but, you know, the roads around here...
Yeah, tell me about it.

55:22.682 --> 55:24.182
This expired,
like, two years ago.

55:24.250 --> 55:25.651
What's up?

55:25.718 --> 55:27.619
I called in to the military base
in Santa Marta.

55:27.687 --> 55:29.221
And?
Are they sending anybody?

55:29.289 --> 55:30.489
They said they need to see you,
in person, and talk to them.

55:30.556 --> 55:32.658
They said the base chief
needs to meet with you.

55:32.725 --> 55:36.295
I guess there's some confusion
about your, uh, situation.

55:36.362 --> 55:37.996
Okay, well, how the hell
am I supposed to

55:38.064 --> 55:39.464
get to Santa Marta --
on the burro?

55:39.532 --> 55:41.099
On the chopper.
It's out back.

55:41.167 --> 55:43.135
The chopper.
Why didn't you say so?

55:43.202 --> 55:44.569
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

55:46.873 --> 55:50.375
So, you really have to go?
You can't just call them?

55:50.443 --> 55:52.044
No, they got reports
that I was kidnapped,

55:52.111 --> 55:53.645
that I was killed,
that I've gone rogue.

55:53.713 --> 55:55.580
So I-I got to go out there
and drag them back myself.

55:55.648 --> 55:57.115
Who will you bring?

55:57.183 --> 55:58.717
Well, the Colombian military's
been working

55:58.785 --> 56:00.152
with the U.S.
on some anti-drug runs,

56:00.219 --> 56:01.820
so they got attack copters,
troops.

56:01.888 --> 56:03.555
Veracruz will find
this place soon.

56:03.623 --> 56:04.790
Yeah. Probably sooner
rather than later.

56:04.857 --> 56:06.358
That's why
we got to hustle.

56:06.426 --> 56:08.226
Okay. Let come.
That is out of the question.

56:09.962 --> 56:11.196
We're overweight as it is.

56:11.264 --> 56:13.632
We should go.

56:15.535 --> 56:18.804
Listen, kid.
I'm coming back, okay?

56:18.871 --> 56:19.905
I'm not gonna
let you guys down.

56:22.875 --> 56:25.444
Okay, so, how well do you know
these Colombian military folks?

56:25.511 --> 56:27.079
I've done some joint operations
with them.

56:27.146 --> 56:29.548
Well, 'cause I was thinking if
they can run this up the ladder,

56:29.615 --> 56:31.383
it'd be good to get
some embassy involvement,

56:31.451 --> 56:33.118
maybe arrange visas
for some of these folks.

56:33.186 --> 56:35.120
We can call Washington.
There's a refugee program

56:35.188 --> 56:36.788
we might be able to get them into.
Sounds good.

56:46.933 --> 56:48.033
Here we go.

57:08.187 --> 57:10.856
- Hey, guys, how long is this gonna take?
- Hard to say.

57:10.923 --> 57:13.825
As soon as we land, we'll find
the foreign affairs officer,

57:13.893 --> 57:15.527
get the ball rolling
on paperwork.

57:15.595 --> 57:17.295
Paperwork?
Yeah, for going back.

57:17.363 --> 57:19.297
You know the drill --
authorization reports...

57:19.365 --> 57:20.899
...Duty orders.
...Debriefing reports.

57:20.967 --> 57:22.567
Hang on a second.
You guys didn't mention

57:22.635 --> 57:24.836
anything about paperwork
when we were down on the ground.

57:24.904 --> 57:27.339
What are you talking about?
It's protocol, man.

57:27.407 --> 57:30.142
The CIA's not gonna send out
a military tactical team

57:30.209 --> 57:31.543
without checking it out.

57:31.611 --> 57:33.879
Why they hell didn't you
mention that back there?

57:33.946 --> 57:35.447
And, uh, what,
cause a riot?

57:35.515 --> 57:38.316
Hey, we got rules to follow,
like anybody else, pal.

57:38.384 --> 57:40.385
Those rules
are also pretty clear --

57:40.453 --> 57:42.287
when a facility's
been compromised,

57:42.355 --> 57:44.689
you take the classified
material and bug out

57:44.757 --> 57:46.525
without causing an
international incident.

57:46.592 --> 57:48.560
Keyword there
would be "without."

57:48.628 --> 57:50.228
I thought you were on board
with all this,

57:50.296 --> 57:51.797
especially with
all that embassy talk.

57:51.864 --> 57:53.598
Visas.

57:53.666 --> 57:56.334
Guys, you promised
those people down there.

57:56.402 --> 57:58.270
<i>- I promised those people.
- Grow up, man.</i>

57:58.337 --> 58:00.272
No way we could have
ever given them

58:00.339 --> 58:02.240
anything near
what you promised them.

58:02.308 --> 58:04.810
Not unless U.S. personnel
were under direct attack.

58:04.877 --> 58:06.378
<i>There's a point
in a soldier's life</i>

58:06.446 --> 58:08.346
<i>where he's got to decide
whether he's gonna follow</i>

58:08.414 --> 58:11.082
<i>the letter or the spirit
of his orders.</i>

58:11.150 --> 58:12.818
So you can't do anything
unless Americans

58:12.885 --> 58:14.186
are under direct attack,
right?

58:14.253 --> 58:15.720
That's right.

58:15.788 --> 58:17.222
What about you guys?
Do you count?

58:17.290 --> 58:19.291
Land the chopper. Now.

58:25.264 --> 58:28.733
You held two
CIA officers hostage

58:28.801 --> 58:30.569
on behalf of a suspected
terrorist group?

58:32.305 --> 58:33.371
That's treason.

58:33.439 --> 58:35.106
Do you think I wanted to?

58:35.174 --> 58:36.775
Do you think
I had a choice?

58:36.843 --> 58:38.443
Sir, we were
not gonna get help

58:38.511 --> 58:41.213
unless those guys told the brass
that they were under attack.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.914
I did what I had to do.

58:42.982 --> 58:44.216
I see.
You had to kidnap them.

58:44.283 --> 58:45.484
"Kidnap." Get out of here.

58:45.551 --> 58:46.918
I was just helping them
do the right thing.

58:46.986 --> 58:49.154
Helping them.
With a .45-caliber pistol?

58:49.222 --> 58:50.722
Well, you know
what they say, sir.

58:50.790 --> 58:53.325
<i>Guns don't help people.
People help people.</i>

58:53.392 --> 58:55.527
You are in a world of hurt,
soldier.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.373
Commander Axe,

59:03.911 --> 59:06.179
as we reconvene
this inquiry,

59:06.207 --> 59:07.874
I am obliged to ask you

59:07.942 --> 59:11.111
if you would like us to
assign you a military lawyer.

59:11.179 --> 59:12.579
- A lawyer?
- I'd advise it.

59:12.647 --> 59:14.881
I thought I was just
making a report here.

59:14.949 --> 59:16.249
Oh, we've gone beyond that,
Commander.

59:16.317 --> 59:19.119
Now, we've detained and
questioned a few of the people

59:19.187 --> 59:22.189
that were involved
in your little adventure,

59:22.256 --> 59:24.424
and there's quite a case
building against you.

59:24.492 --> 59:26.493
Wait, wait.
You're rounding people up?

59:26.561 --> 59:29.029
Yes, the farmers, the doctor,
Amanda Maples.

59:29.097 --> 59:31.765
Those are my friends, sir.
They didn't do anything wrong.

59:31.833 --> 59:33.700
It's standard operating
procedure, Commander.

59:33.768 --> 59:36.236
"Standard operating procedure."
Why don't you bite me?

59:36.304 --> 59:37.838
You're speaking
to a superior officer!

59:37.905 --> 59:39.673
<i>You're speaking
to a superior officer!</i>

59:39.741 --> 59:41.074
Stand down, Commander!

59:41.142 --> 59:44.911
Now, you've underestimated
the sheer size of this fiasco.

59:44.979 --> 59:46.580
And by all accounts,
you are standing

59:46.647 --> 59:48.215
in the middle of it,
dead center.

59:48.282 --> 59:49.449
So, last chance --
do you want to

59:49.517 --> 59:51.118
exercise your right
to legal counsel?

59:51.185 --> 59:53.787
I'm good.

59:53.855 --> 59:55.889
You know what these proceedings
could result in.

59:55.957 --> 59:57.624
Yeah, me getting thrown into a
hole for the rest of my life?

59:57.692 --> 59:58.959
Yeah, I got it.

59:59.027 --> 01:00:00.293
I also know that a lawyer

01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:02.195
is not gonna make
a damn bit of difference.

01:00:02.263 --> 01:00:04.531
Now, sir, you want to hang
this mess around my neck,

01:00:04.599 --> 01:00:06.400
you go for it,
but leave my friends alone.

01:00:06.467 --> 01:00:09.136
You're in no position
to negotiate, Commander Axe.

01:00:09.203 --> 01:00:11.705
Now I want to hear
about what happened

01:00:11.773 --> 01:00:15.208
after you drew your weapon
on two CIA field agents.

01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:17.310
All right. Fine.

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:20.113
After my "conversation"
with the CIA boys,

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.481
we went back
to the outpost.

01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:23.316
And let me tell you
something, sir --

01:00:23.384 --> 01:00:25.052
everybody was real glad
to see me.

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:26.653
- Change of plans.
- That was quick.

01:00:26.802 --> 01:00:28.467
You do know that the town
is the other way?

01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:30.155
I thought you were going
to get help.

01:00:30.223 --> 01:00:32.658
- Yeah, there was a little hitch.
- What kind of a hitch?

01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:33.859
Turns out
our CIA buddies

01:00:33.927 --> 01:00:35.461
were not such good buddies
after all.

01:00:35.528 --> 01:00:37.596
They were planning on leaving
everybody to the wolves.

01:00:37.664 --> 01:00:39.164
I disagreed
with that plan.

01:00:39.232 --> 01:00:42.034
What --
and they are...?

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:43.502
Tied up
in the helicopter.

01:00:45.272 --> 01:00:47.339
Oh, that is not good.

01:00:47.407 --> 01:00:49.575
Okay, so, um, now what
are we supposed to do?

01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:51.043
Aren't you the one who said

01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:52.611
that we were going to
get slaughtered?

01:00:52.679 --> 01:00:55.014
That's not gonna happen.

01:00:55.081 --> 01:00:56.548
So you have a plan?

01:00:56.616 --> 01:01:00.920
Uh, no, but I know
where to start.

01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:06.659
Make the call.
I'm not calling in.

01:01:06.726 --> 01:01:07.960
Do it.
You'll thank me later.

01:01:08.028 --> 01:01:09.695
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we won't thank you.

01:01:09.763 --> 01:01:11.897
Yeah, you will. Because Veracruz
is following our trail here.

01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:13.499
And when he does,
he's gonna wipe this place

01:01:13.566 --> 01:01:16.802
off the face of the earth,
and you two yahoos with it.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.104
What do you want?

01:01:19.172 --> 01:01:21.040
I want you to call
your CIA buddies,

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:23.042
tell them to get the
Colombian military out here,

01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:24.977
the national police -- the
works, everything they got.

01:01:25.045 --> 01:01:26.278
You're gonna burn for this.

01:01:26.346 --> 01:01:27.646
Yeah, but that's
not the question.

01:01:27.714 --> 01:01:29.581
The question is whether
you're gonna make that call...

01:01:29.649 --> 01:01:31.717
Or if I'm gonna have to
make you make the call.

01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:42.695
Yeah, it's Gabriel Manaro
out at station 412.

01:01:42.762 --> 01:01:44.163
We got a situation here.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:46.832
Some kind of rogue military
force is attacking our position.

01:01:49.569 --> 01:01:50.703
Just helping you sell it.

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.304
Yeah, yeah, that's --

01:01:52.372 --> 01:01:55.207
we're firing back at them.
We need supp--

01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:56.976
be more convincing.

01:01:57.043 --> 01:01:59.044
Jesus! No.
No, I'm not talking to you.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.581
We need help!
We need support now!

01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:04.917
Send it! Send the help!
Military support! Now!

01:02:04.985 --> 01:02:08.921
Help us!
I am at station 4-1-2!

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:10.022
Yes! Yes! Just hurry!

01:02:11.224 --> 01:02:13.425
They'll have a team here
in three hours.

01:02:13.493 --> 01:02:15.294
Three hours?
Veracruz is just up the road.

01:02:15.362 --> 01:02:17.096
He's gonna be all over us
in three hours.

01:02:17.163 --> 01:02:18.030
Yeah, well, they're coming
from over the mountains.

01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:19.531
That's what it takes,
dude!

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:21.633
That's the fastest they can
get here. It's not magic.

01:02:21.701 --> 01:02:23.469
What's going on?
Who's shooting?

01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:26.705
- That was me just making a point.
- Okay, what?

01:02:26.773 --> 01:02:27.906
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

01:02:27.974 --> 01:02:29.408
Good news is,
help is on the way.

01:02:29.476 --> 01:02:32.378
Bad news is, we're gonna have to
hold out until it gets here.

01:02:32.445 --> 01:02:33.712
Okay, señors.

01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:41.453
Hey, look what I made.

01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:43.622
That's a hell of a bomb.
Wow. You got a gift.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:45.958
Well, you know, I've been
doing field medicine

01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:47.726
for a long time.
You learn to improvise.

01:02:47.794 --> 01:02:49.228
Yeah, well, I've known
a lot of field medics,

01:02:49.295 --> 01:02:50.763
but they don't have your chops
with explosives.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.865
- Good work.
- Thank you.

01:02:52.932 --> 01:02:54.099
Where's the kid?

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.508
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:03.842
What?

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.277
You know, this, um --

01:03:05.345 --> 01:03:08.280
this fight with Veracruz,
it's gonna be rough.

01:03:08.348 --> 01:03:09.982
We got to hold them off
for a long time.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:11.450
So I was thinking
it would be a good idea

01:03:11.518 --> 01:03:14.119
if you just stay back here
and watch the CIA guys.

01:03:14.187 --> 01:03:16.155
Stay here?
I'm fighting with the others.

01:03:16.222 --> 01:03:19.158
Okay, okay.
Just hear me out here.

01:03:19.225 --> 01:03:21.760
Now, you're still young, and
you've done more in this fight

01:03:21.828 --> 01:03:23.462
than any kid
should ever have to.

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:26.365
Those men
killed my father.

01:03:26.433 --> 01:03:29.368
I think it's safe to say
if your dad was here,

01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:31.170
he wouldn't want you
catching a bullet.

01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:33.072
I mean, think about it.
What would he say?

01:03:33.139 --> 01:03:37.342
I don't know.
He's not here.

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:41.980
He would say a kid as tough
and as smart as you

01:03:42.048 --> 01:03:44.149
is gonna have
a big future.

01:03:44.217 --> 01:03:45.951
He'd want you to grow up
and see it, wouldn't he?

01:03:46.019 --> 01:03:49.121
He would want me to stay.

01:03:49.189 --> 01:03:52.224
So you'll stay?

01:03:52.292 --> 01:03:56.328
No.
But thanks anyways.

01:03:56.396 --> 01:03:58.197
You remind me
of my father.

01:03:58.264 --> 01:04:00.833
And I didn't listen
to him, either.

01:04:03.603 --> 01:04:05.404
Kids these days.

01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:07.573
All right, mount up!

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.741
<i>We did a little recon
when we got out to the road</i>

01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:12.010
<i>and we got some more bad news.</i>

01:04:12.078 --> 01:04:14.480
<i>Veracruz's buddy Perez
showed up,</i>

01:04:14.547 --> 01:04:15.981
<i>and he brought more guys
with him --</i>

01:04:16.049 --> 01:04:18.650
<i>a lot more guys,
with a lot more guns.</i>

01:04:38.338 --> 01:04:41.073
<i>Still, there wasn't much to do
but stick with the plan.</i>

01:04:41.141 --> 01:04:44.843
<i>We had our little explosive
device cobbled together</i>

01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:46.879
<i>from some C-4 charges
the CIA guys had</i>

01:04:46.946 --> 01:04:49.014
<i>in case they needed to blow up
their computers in a hurry.</i>

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:53.519
<i>The way I figured it,</i>

01:04:53.586 --> 01:04:55.087
<i>if we could plant it
at the right spot,</i>

01:04:55.155 --> 01:04:57.322
<i>we could block the road
with a couple thousand pounds</i>

01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:58.957
<i>of burning truck wreckage</i>

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:01.360
<i>then pin Veracruz down
for a while.</i>

01:05:03.196 --> 01:05:04.530
You should probably go.

01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:08.000
No. No. Do it.

01:05:08.067 --> 01:05:11.770
<i>That is, assuming we didn't
blow ourselves up first.</i>

01:05:16.075 --> 01:05:18.710
Okay. Let's go.

01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:21.880
I know we were not expecting
the reinforcements.

01:05:24.217 --> 01:05:28.053
And the odds are, um,
kind of against us.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:33.625
But what the hell?
You're the flaming sword, right?

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:39.865
Now, look, they got to
come from down there.

01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:42.768
When that bomb blows,

01:05:42.835 --> 01:05:44.570
it's gonna be our job
to slow them down.

01:05:47.373 --> 01:05:49.575
'Cause if they get through here -- pbht! --
We are sitting ducks.

01:05:49.642 --> 01:05:52.177
Pbht!

01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:53.879
Sitting ducks?

01:05:53.947 --> 01:05:55.314
It's an expression.

01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:59.585
It's like ducks in a pond,
ducks in a row. It's easy to --

01:06:10.496 --> 01:06:12.531
How bad is this?

01:06:12.599 --> 01:06:14.233
Oh, well, maybe we had
a solid chance

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.901
before that troop transport
showed up.

01:06:15.969 --> 01:06:17.502
But now...

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.605
And how long do we
have to hold them?

01:06:19.672 --> 01:06:22.140
Help comes
in about two hours.

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:23.675
Veracruz and his men,
give or take 90 minutes,

01:06:23.743 --> 01:06:26.111
so I think we got to hold out
for about a half-hour.

01:06:26.179 --> 01:06:27.746
Can we do that?

01:06:27.814 --> 01:06:29.214
Well, with the terrain
on our side, maybe.

01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:32.818
But it's gonna be
a long half-hour.

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:34.653
But, hey, it could be worse,
right?

01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:37.756
It could be raining.
Let's do this.

01:06:37.824 --> 01:06:41.593
<i>Now, at this point, we didn't
have a whole lot going for us.</i>

01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:42.961
<i>On our side,
we had the high ground</i>

01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:44.563
<i>and the element of surprise.</i>

01:06:44.631 --> 01:06:48.066
<i>On their side,
they had manpower,</i>

01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:50.402
<i>equipment, body armor,
superior weaponry,</i>

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.638
<i>radio communications, and
pretty much everything else.</i>

01:07:11.524 --> 01:07:12.424
Is he on it, or is he not on?

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.028
He's not on it.
If he was on it, it would --

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:20.866
Luis, now!

01:07:27.607 --> 01:07:31.009
Ha! Flaming sword!

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:33.945
Damn right.
Flaming sword! Attack!

01:07:34.013 --> 01:07:35.347
Zone blitz!

01:07:35.415 --> 01:07:36.548
Zone blitz!

01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.938
Good shot, Mondo.

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.434
The men are running
out of ammunition.

01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:31.002
Tell them to act like
they're shooting.

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:32.938
Just keep looking mean, pretend
like they have ammunition.

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:34.305
What?!

01:08:34.374 --> 01:08:35.506
Just do it!

01:08:41.113 --> 01:08:43.749
<i>I pulled out every trick
in the book.</i>

01:08:43.816 --> 01:08:45.884
<i>But the thing is,
at the end of the day,</i>

01:08:45.952 --> 01:08:49.154
<i>there's just no good substitute
for bullets.</i>

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:20.185
No!

01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:24.523
Okay, uh, I don't think
they're buying it.

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.724
All right, look,
game over.

01:09:25.792 --> 01:09:27.392
Tell them to fall back
to the trucks.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.434
Old man! Let's go!

01:09:37.437 --> 01:09:39.304
No.

01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:54.286
Wait.
W-what is he doing?

01:09:54.353 --> 01:09:56.788
He's covering us.

01:09:56.856 --> 01:09:59.291
Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:10.168
Espada Ardiente!

01:10:13.806 --> 01:10:15.774
I got to go back.
Ben.

01:10:15.842 --> 01:10:17.843
I got one more charge,
just in case.

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:18.844
We got to get him.

01:10:31.457 --> 01:10:33.358
Aren't you
full of surprises.

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:44.369
Oh, Jesus.
He's dead.

01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:50.242
Are you okay?
No! I'm shot!

01:10:50.309 --> 01:10:51.877
That's right.
Stupid question. Okay.

01:10:51.944 --> 01:10:54.379
Let's do it.

01:11:17.385 --> 01:11:19.853
Get him inside.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.822
Damn it.
Where the hell are they?

01:11:28.429 --> 01:11:32.565
Beatriz, they're coming.
Let's get inside.

01:11:32.633 --> 01:11:35.001
Get off me!
Don't! Please, kid. I'm begging you.

01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:37.103
They killed Luis,
and I'm going to fight them!

01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:39.873
Look, I know that he meant
a lot to you, okay?

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.575
But he was a soldier.
He was protecting you.

01:11:42.643 --> 01:11:44.711
Don't make his death
meaningless

01:11:44.779 --> 01:11:46.579
by standing out here
and getting yourself killed.

01:11:46.647 --> 01:11:48.415
Please, if you won't
go inside for me,

01:11:48.482 --> 01:11:49.883
at least do it
for the old goat herder.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.688
Where the hell are they?
Call 'em again.

01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:01.294
How much longer?

01:12:01.362 --> 01:12:03.329
'Ca-- 'cause we're
running out of time up here.

01:12:03.397 --> 01:12:05.331
It's -- the situation
is getting urgent --

01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:06.866
Yeah, is this
the station chief?

01:12:06.934 --> 01:12:09.069
I got to know how much longer
this is gonna take,

01:12:09.136 --> 01:12:10.970
and your numbnuts officer here
can't tell me.

01:12:11.038 --> 01:12:12.238
Who is this?

01:12:12.306 --> 01:12:15.975
Who is this?
Who is this?!

01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:17.777
Deputy assistant intelligence
director Chuck Finley.

01:12:17.845 --> 01:12:19.079
That's who.

01:12:19.146 --> 01:12:20.780
I'm down
from NSA headquarters here

01:12:20.848 --> 01:12:22.215
doing a random sigint check,

01:12:22.283 --> 01:12:24.517
and I ran into this little
disaster area of yours.

01:12:24.585 --> 01:12:25.885
Now, where are these troops?

01:12:25.953 --> 01:12:27.620
They're 10 minutes away,
sir.

01:12:27.688 --> 01:12:29.689
10 minutes?
This thing will be over in 5.

01:12:29.757 --> 01:12:30.890
Get on it.

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:33.693
Chuck Finley?

01:12:33.761 --> 01:12:35.662
Yeah. Made a lot of money
betting on him back in the day.

01:12:35.729 --> 01:12:38.731
I'm thinking
it's a lucky name.

01:12:38.799 --> 01:12:39.899
I guess we'll find out.

01:12:41.469 --> 01:12:44.037
<i>Between the flipped truck
and the firefight,</i>

01:12:44.105 --> 01:12:45.705
<i>we bought ourselves some time.</i>

01:12:45.773 --> 01:12:48.374
<i>But it wasn't too long before
Veracruz was in position,</i>

01:12:48.442 --> 01:12:50.443
<i>and we were
about to get creamed.</i>

01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:53.146
Keep everybody inside.

01:12:53.214 --> 01:12:54.614
When the shooting starts,

01:12:54.682 --> 01:12:57.450
make sure they're away from
the windows and down low, okay?

01:13:20.975 --> 01:13:22.742
I'm going out there.

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.311
You're what?

01:13:25.379 --> 01:13:26.679
I got to buy us
some more time.

01:13:26.747 --> 01:13:29.449
Sam, if you go out there,
Veracruz will kill you.

01:13:29.517 --> 01:13:30.750
Yeah. Maybe.

01:13:30.818 --> 01:13:32.552
But if I manage to die slowly,
that'll put you guys

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.220
just a little closer
to getting out of here.

01:13:34.288 --> 01:13:36.589
No, no, no. You're at least
taking your gun.

01:13:36.657 --> 01:13:39.859
If he sees that I have a gun,
he's gonna shoot me on sight.

01:13:39.927 --> 01:13:41.427
Don't worry about it.
I got an idea.

01:13:41.495 --> 01:13:42.795
No, no. Wait.

01:13:42.863 --> 01:13:45.598
I mean, they --
you can't --

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:47.600
ju-- if you just --

01:13:47.668 --> 01:13:50.303
stay alive.

01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:51.471
I'll do my best.

01:13:51.539 --> 01:13:53.973
Still, you know,
if we were gonna kiss,

01:13:54.041 --> 01:13:56.509
we should probably do it now
just in case.

01:13:56.577 --> 01:13:59.612
I don't want to...

01:14:04.485 --> 01:14:08.955
That is a lot better
than a kick in the teeth.

01:14:58.105 --> 01:15:00.807
Whoa. Whoa.

01:15:02.776 --> 01:15:04.077
Hey, guys,
we need to talk.

01:15:04.144 --> 01:15:06.412
What is there to talk about,
Commander Axe?

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.147
Oh, we got a lot
to talk about.

01:15:08.215 --> 01:15:10.516
I'm here to negotiate
the terms of your surrender.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.054
Our surrender?
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:15:25.966 --> 01:15:27.233
How long
before they get here?

01:15:27.301 --> 01:15:29.769
I don't know. Soon.

01:15:29.837 --> 01:15:32.505
They better get here
soon.

01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:38.911
Man, you just love doing that,
don't you?

01:15:38.979 --> 01:15:40.747
How many are there
inside?

01:15:40.814 --> 01:15:44.917
Believe me, y-you don't know
what you're up against.

01:15:44.985 --> 01:15:45.852
Yes, "Espada Ardiente."
We know.

01:15:45.919 --> 01:15:48.021
No. No.

01:15:48.088 --> 01:15:49.555
It's the flaming sword.

01:15:49.623 --> 01:15:52.225
Believe me, you don't want to
mess with them.

01:15:52.293 --> 01:15:53.426
And why is that?

01:15:53.494 --> 01:15:55.094
'Cause I've fought
all over --

01:15:55.162 --> 01:15:57.196
Afghanistan, the Balkans,
Southeast Asia.

01:15:57.264 --> 01:15:58.898
I've never seen guys
like this.

01:15:58.966 --> 01:16:00.700
I count a dozen men
with old rifle--

01:16:00.768 --> 01:16:02.902
farmers,
by the look of them.

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:05.605
Yeah? You think
that's all we got?

01:16:05.673 --> 01:16:07.473
Then what am I
doing here?

01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.108
I'm a commander
in the Navy S.E.A.L.S.

01:16:09.176 --> 01:16:10.576
You think
I'm gonna be wasting time

01:16:10.644 --> 01:16:12.111
with a bunch
of smelly farmers --

01:16:12.179 --> 01:16:14.981
smelly, stinking,
unwashed farmers?

01:16:15.049 --> 01:16:16.549
No, no.

01:16:16.617 --> 01:16:18.885
You boys have made
a grave miscalculation.

01:16:18.952 --> 01:16:21.321
That's why I'm here
with my one-time-only,

01:16:21.388 --> 01:16:22.722
not-to-be-repeated
offer --

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:25.325
unconditional surrender
right now,

01:16:25.392 --> 01:16:26.959
and I'll let you
walk away.

01:16:29.863 --> 01:16:31.064
You're bluffing.

01:16:32.366 --> 01:16:33.466
What is he doing?

01:16:34.735 --> 01:16:36.336
No!

01:16:38.238 --> 01:16:39.572
Ohh.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.240
All right, all right.

01:16:41.308 --> 01:16:43.810
Because I am feeling...

01:16:43.877 --> 01:16:48.648
Generous and, uh,
merciful...

01:16:48.716 --> 01:16:50.783
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:16:50.851 --> 01:16:55.054
Surrender right now.
Okay? I'm serious.

01:16:57.725 --> 01:16:58.925
What is he doing?!

01:17:04.498 --> 01:17:05.932
I'm telling you guys,

01:17:05.999 --> 01:17:08.601
you're just making it worse
on yourself.

01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:10.203
Ugh, we should finish him.
Wait!

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:13.573
Let's see this flaming sword,
shall we?

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.075
I'm telling you guys,
you're gonna regret it.

01:17:20.914 --> 01:17:22.081
Aah!

01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:23.383
<i>I've heard the old saying</i>

01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:25.017
<i>about soldiers
praying in foxholes.</i>

01:17:25.085 --> 01:17:27.520
<i>It's a natural response
when your friends are dying</i>

01:17:27.588 --> 01:17:30.690
<i>and everything you care about
is about to get destroyed.</i>

01:17:30.758 --> 01:17:33.025
<i>But I got to say,
in my experience,</i>

01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:35.528
<i>prayer is pretty iffy
as a battle plan.</i>

01:17:35.596 --> 01:17:39.432
Aah!

01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:43.870
<i>But I'll also say this --</i>

01:17:43.937 --> 01:17:45.838
<i>when you need a miracle,
there's nothing like it.</i>

01:18:02.222 --> 01:18:08.027
Hey, guys.
Say hello to my friends.

01:18:08.095 --> 01:18:10.763
I call them the newest members
of the flaming sword,

01:18:10.831 --> 01:18:12.698
you crooked son of a bitch.

01:18:41.962 --> 01:18:44.230
Sam -- Sam Axe.

01:18:44.298 --> 01:18:46.265
The good guys --
it's the good guy--

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:48.801
<i>uh, Los buenos.
Los buenos.</i>

01:18:57.511 --> 01:18:59.745
So, you guys ready
to surrender now?

01:19:00.447 --> 01:19:02.114
Aah!

01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:10.323
Man, that felt good.

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:12.124
Sam Axe!

01:19:40.721 --> 01:19:42.021
So, you gonna make it?

01:19:42.089 --> 01:19:43.356
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

01:19:43.423 --> 01:19:44.657
Well, I got to say,

01:19:44.725 --> 01:19:46.993
if you ever reconsider
the whole medical thing,

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.028
you'd make a hell
of a soldier.

01:19:49.096 --> 01:19:50.596
Okay.

01:19:50.664 --> 01:19:52.598
All right, I will -- I will,
uh -- I'll keep that in mind.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:54.667
Listen, Sam...

01:19:54.735 --> 01:19:56.736
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

01:19:56.803 --> 01:19:58.037
Back at you, doc.

01:19:58.105 --> 01:20:00.573
All right.

01:20:00.641 --> 01:20:01.774
Help this man up.

01:20:06.179 --> 01:20:08.247
So, what happens now?

01:20:08.315 --> 01:20:10.416
Well, it's gonna take a while
to sort this all out.

01:20:10.484 --> 01:20:12.084
My guess
is that Veracruz and Perez

01:20:12.152 --> 01:20:15.254
are gonna be going off the grid
for their foreseeable lifetimes.

01:20:15.322 --> 01:20:17.123
No, I mean,
what about you?

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:19.825
Oh, I'm probably gonna get spend
some quality time

01:20:19.893 --> 01:20:21.827
at the nearest
covert military facility.

01:20:25.065 --> 01:20:26.966
Well, uh, good luck.

01:20:27.034 --> 01:20:29.068
Thanks.

01:20:29.136 --> 01:20:31.871
And, uh...
Thanks for the kiss, huh?

01:20:31.939 --> 01:20:34.507
I mean, I know
you probably only did it

01:20:34.575 --> 01:20:36.312
'cause you thought
I was gonna die, but --

01:20:36.313 --> 01:20:37.513
Oh, my God.

01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:47.820
Commander Axe...
You need to come with us.

01:20:58.498 --> 01:21:00.232
Señor Axe...

01:21:58.992 --> 01:22:02.495
And here I am.

01:22:02.562 --> 01:22:04.030
That's quite a story,
Commander Axe.

01:22:04.097 --> 01:22:06.699
Thanks.
How does it end, sir?

01:22:06.767 --> 01:22:08.467
There's only one way
it could end --

01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:10.136
a court martial.

01:22:10.203 --> 01:22:12.171
Well, sir, there is actually
one more part of the story

01:22:12.239 --> 01:22:13.305
that you should
probably hear.

01:22:13.373 --> 01:22:14.840
I mean, I was saving it

01:22:14.908 --> 01:22:16.776
in case you decided to be
a stand-up guy about all this,

01:22:16.843 --> 01:22:18.144
but I guess
that's not gonna happen.

01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.578
What are you talking
about?

01:22:19.646 --> 01:22:21.647
Do you remember the little chat
I had with Beatriz

01:22:21.715 --> 01:22:23.049
after Luis died?

01:22:23.116 --> 01:22:26.318
Well,
there's something I left out.

01:22:26.386 --> 01:22:28.054
He was protecting you.

01:22:28.121 --> 01:22:29.722
Don't make his death
meaningless

01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:32.058
by staying outside
and getting yourself killed.

01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:34.193
It's my fault!

01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:36.295
It's my fault --
all of this.

01:22:36.363 --> 01:22:37.697
<i>Now, the first half
of the discussion</i>

01:22:37.764 --> 01:22:39.298
<i>went just like I told you.</i>

01:22:39.366 --> 01:22:40.800
<i>It was in the second half,
though,</i>

01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:42.134
<i>where things got
really interesting.</i>

01:22:42.202 --> 01:22:44.437
Kid, don't say that.

01:22:44.504 --> 01:22:46.539
This has nothing to do
with you.

01:22:46.606 --> 01:22:48.340
The flaming sword -- they knew
what they were getting into.

01:22:48.408 --> 01:22:50.009
There's no flaming sword!

01:22:50.077 --> 01:22:51.744
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:22:51.812 --> 01:22:53.713
My father interviewed Luis
for the newspaper,

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.149
and I went with him,
so I knew all his story --

01:22:57.217 --> 01:23:00.653
that he was in the army
and he went away to be a farmer.

01:23:00.721 --> 01:23:04.857
After my father was killed,
I went back to Luis.

01:23:04.925 --> 01:23:08.728
I gave him the name
of "Espada Ardiente,"

01:23:08.795 --> 01:23:10.362
and I convinced him
to fight!

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:12.031
Wait a minute.

01:23:12.099 --> 01:23:17.203
<i>So all of this
was your idea?</i>

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:18.771
Everything.

01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:23.809
I should die here.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.482
Now, look, kid...

01:23:29.549 --> 01:23:30.983
This is not over,

01:23:31.051 --> 01:23:32.151
not by a long shot.

01:23:32.219 --> 01:23:33.652
Now, we're gonna
get through this.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.121
And I've been around long enough
to know when this is all over,

01:23:35.188 --> 01:23:37.022
there's gonna be hell
to pay.

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:40.192
You want something to live for?
You want to help your friends?

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.328
'Cause I got a job
for you.

01:23:42.395 --> 01:23:44.430
You any good
with a camera?

01:23:45.766 --> 01:23:47.500
So, I figured if anybody
could get away clean

01:23:47.567 --> 01:23:49.335
after that little skirmish,
it was a kid.

01:23:49.402 --> 01:23:50.903
And a kid
with connections

01:23:50.971 --> 01:23:52.371
at the largest newspaper
in Colombia?

01:23:53.807 --> 01:23:55.207
Well, that could be
mighty handy.

01:23:56.977 --> 01:23:59.512
<i>I had her grab one of the
cameras from the CIA outpost</i>

01:23:59.579 --> 01:24:02.982
<i>and take pictures --
a lot of them --</i>

01:24:03.049 --> 01:24:04.784
<i>of everyone and everything...</i>

01:24:14.027 --> 01:24:16.262
<i>...Then get herself
down to Bogotá,</i>

01:24:16.329 --> 01:24:18.230
<i>and go back to her dad's
old newspaper...</i>

01:24:26.006 --> 01:24:27.807
Beatriz!

01:24:27.874 --> 01:24:30.142
<i>...And once she got there,
to talk to someone she trusted</i>

01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:32.211
<i>about putting together
a couple of stories.</i>

01:24:37.951 --> 01:24:42.454
Now, one of these stories
should be in today's paper.

01:24:42.522 --> 01:24:44.390
In fact, sir,
isn't there a piece

01:24:44.457 --> 01:24:46.392
on the front page today
about Luis,

01:24:46.459 --> 01:24:49.328
talking about how he died
under mysterious circumstances?

01:24:51.231 --> 01:24:53.165
There was. Yes.

01:24:53.233 --> 01:24:56.468
Oh, how interesting.

01:24:59.973 --> 01:25:02.675
Why don't we all
take a break?

01:25:02.742 --> 01:25:04.844
Yes, sir.

01:25:11.685 --> 01:25:12.818
You don't really think

01:25:12.886 --> 01:25:14.753
that anyone's gonna take
this girl's word

01:25:14.821 --> 01:25:17.089
over that
of the United States military?

01:25:17.157 --> 01:25:19.825
Well, the girl
did have extensive access

01:25:19.893 --> 01:25:21.894
to a covert
CIA outpost, sir.

01:25:21.962 --> 01:25:23.996
I mean,
imagine what she saw

01:25:24.064 --> 01:25:26.565
and took pictures of.

01:25:26.633 --> 01:25:28.868
Tell me, what happens when spies
who are under official cover

01:25:28.935 --> 01:25:31.237
get their pictures
in the paper?

01:25:31.304 --> 01:25:32.504
I mean,
that can't be good, right?

01:25:32.572 --> 01:25:33.539
You wouldn't dare.

01:25:33.607 --> 01:25:34.907
This is the sort of thing

01:25:34.975 --> 01:25:37.443
that you don't want revealed
to the world, Admiral,

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:38.744
and it's gonna be --

01:25:38.812 --> 01:25:41.914
things that could end
a guy's military career,

01:25:41.982 --> 01:25:43.282
and I'm not
talking about mine.

01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.818
What do you want?

01:25:45.886 --> 01:25:47.152
Thanks for asking.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.221
First,
you let my friends go.

01:25:49.289 --> 01:25:51.223
Then you rebuild
the clinic.

01:25:51.291 --> 01:25:53.959
The flaming sword guys
go back to their goats,

01:25:54.027 --> 01:25:55.895
I get
an honorable discharge,

01:25:55.962 --> 01:25:58.230
and we keep our mouths shut
about this forever.

01:25:58.298 --> 01:26:00.566
In the words of my buddy
Mike Westen,

01:26:00.634 --> 01:26:03.202
<i>"this is the kind of secret
that stays a secret."</i>

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:04.570
That's blackmail.

01:26:04.638 --> 01:26:07.840
No. Actually, sir, I believe
this form of extortion

01:26:07.908 --> 01:26:09.775
is known as "graymail."

01:26:09.843 --> 01:26:11.844
It's much nicer
than blackmail.

01:26:15.582 --> 01:26:18.150
I believe
we're done here, sir.

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.891
<i>Agreement between
commander Sam Axe</i>

01:26:25.959 --> 01:26:27.993
<i>and the United States
military court.</i>

<i>Under the terms

01:26:29.829 --> 01:26:32.264
<i>Commander Axe hereby agrees

<i>a change of clothes,
