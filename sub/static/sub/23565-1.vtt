00:47.760 --> 00:50.208
Say, man, how's about a shine, mister?

00:50.308 --> 00:51.881
No.

00:52.306 --> 00:55.392
Come on, put your foot up there.
I'll shine it up good.

00:55.517 --> 00:57.770
OK, make it snappy.

00:57.895 --> 01:02.232
Gonna shine 'em up good
so you can see your face in 'em.

01:10.532 --> 01:13.619
Hurry up, kid. Come on, hurry up.

01:19.291 --> 01:23.671
No shit, man. Takes time
to shine 'em up bright.

01:38.852 --> 01:43.065
You little bastard! You little black
bastard, let go of my leg! Let go!

01:43.190 --> 01:46.151
Let go! Let go of my leg!

01:49.029 --> 01:52.699
<i>I was born in New York City on a Monday</i>

01:54.451 --> 01:58.664
<i>It seems I was out shinin' shoes
by Tuesday noon</i>

01:59.748 --> 02:05.003
<i>All the fat cats in their bad hats
doin' me a real big favour</i>

02:05.129 --> 02:10.633
<i>I got the fat cats in their bad hats
playin' it on real good</i>

02:10.758 --> 02:13.429
<i>Here's a dime, boy</i>

02:13.554 --> 02:16.515
<i>Give me a shine, boy</i>

02:16.640 --> 02:20.769
<i>Down and out in New York City</i>

02:22.187 --> 02:25.691
<i>Got nowhere to be, but where can you go</i>

02:27.234 --> 02:31.947
<i>When you're down and out in New York City</i>

02:32.865 --> 02:36.910
<i>I'm never, never, never
gonna get that way again</i>

02:38.537 --> 02:42.666
<i>Down and out in New York City</i>

02:43.959 --> 02:47.713
<i>Got nowhere to be, but where can you go</i>

02:49.047 --> 02:53.802
<i>When you're down and out in New York City</i>

02:54.803 --> 02:58.932
<i>I'm never, never, never
gonna get that way again</i>

03:01.101 --> 03:02.311
<i>No</i>

03:02.436 --> 03:04.104
<i>No, no</i>

03:04.229 --> 03:07.316
<i>No, no, not me</i>

03:13.447 --> 03:15.908
<i>When you need a break</i>

03:16.950 --> 03:18.785
<i>You need an angle</i>

03:19.828 --> 03:22.497
<i>When you want a friend</i>

03:22.623 --> 03:27.252
<i>Gonna get myself together in the morning</i>

03:28.712 --> 03:33.508
<i>Gonna leave it all as one bad dream</i>

03:33.634 --> 03:38.889
<i>All the fat cats in their bad hats
are doin' me a real big favour</i>

03:39.014 --> 03:44.603
<i>They've got the fat cats in their
bad hats playin' it on real good</i>

03:44.728 --> 03:47.189
<i>Here's a dime, boy</i>

03:47.314 --> 03:49.565
<i>Give me a shine</i>

04:02.955 --> 04:05.332
Niggers aren't allowed in this building.

04:05.457 --> 04:07.918
They never are.

04:09.086 --> 04:11.755
I been sent with this.

04:17.844 --> 04:19.805
- You ever see me before?
- No.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.515
You're lyin', blackbird.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.394
- Who's at the door, Jack?
- The janitor.

04:25.519 --> 04:28.188
We'll be back in a minute.

04:38.031 --> 04:41.535
Where's the fella who usually
brings me this envelope?

04:41.660 --> 04:43.954
How should I know?

04:44.079 --> 04:46.790
You don't know a lot of things.

04:46.915 --> 04:50.001
You and me better take us a little walk.

04:53.922 --> 04:58.093
Remember, nigger, you've never seen me,
you've never been here.

04:58.218 --> 05:01.847
You got more to be afraid of
from me than anybody.

05:01.972 --> 05:05.058
I'll cut your black balls off.
You hear me?

05:05.183 --> 05:07.561
I hear ya.

05:09.813 --> 05:12.607
Oh, just a minute.
There's not enough here.

05:12.733 --> 05:16.027
- Enough what?
- It's $50 short. Now, where is it?

05:16.153 --> 05:19.406
I don't know. I don't have it.

05:19.531 --> 05:22.117
You're lyin', boy.

05:22.242 --> 05:24.911
I don't have it.

05:25.537 --> 05:30.333
Listen, nigger, they wouldn't dare
short-change me. So cough it up.

05:30.459 --> 05:33.378
They did it, didn't they?

05:33.503 --> 05:36.006
I don't have it!

05:40.886 --> 05:43.346
I'll take it off of you.

05:57.444 --> 06:01.031
I could put a bullet through you
for carrying a switchblade.

06:01.156 --> 06:05.202
Do you want to be put away
or are you gonna give me that 50 bucks?

06:05.327 --> 06:09.956
Look, you fuckin' ass! I ain't got your
money. You don't get pissed at me!

06:10.081 --> 06:12.167
Get out!

07:07.847 --> 07:09.891
Yeah, come in.

07:11.101 --> 07:14.854
Why aren't you with the other guys?
Why are you always by yourself?

07:14.980 --> 07:20.193
Well, the, uh, the other guys,
they... they don't want me around.

07:20.318 --> 07:23.405
Oh. Well, you're the one I wanna see.

07:26.324 --> 07:30.412
See, I'm gonna be gone
for a few years under this rap.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.665
I'm gonna learn a lot.
I want you to learn a lot too.

07:33.790 --> 07:37.252
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, you're the big brain.

07:37.377 --> 07:40.422
- I take good care of you.
- I'll be all right.

07:40.547 --> 07:44.676
Just shut up and listen!
I want you to finish school - high school.

07:44.801 --> 07:48.346
I was figurin' on CCNY someday.
It's for free.

07:48.471 --> 07:51.099
I want you to learn where to put money

07:51.224 --> 07:53.768
so you end up with
more than you started with.

07:53.893 --> 07:58.022
Then when I get out, and I've started
my business, you'll be with me.

07:58.148 --> 08:01.401
Sure. Anything you say.

08:02.277 --> 08:05.697
- Now get out before you start cryin'.
- I ain't cryin'.

08:05.822 --> 08:09.409
OK, so you're not cryin'!
Get out. Fuck off.

08:13.288 --> 08:16.416
And Joe, before I see you again,

08:16.541 --> 08:19.210
I want you to get laid.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.287
Make it snappy. I gotta catch
a four o'clock flight to Vegas.

08:54.412 --> 08:56.247
Yes, sir.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.792
- You ever been to Vegas?
- No.

08:59.918 --> 09:05.173
Figures. I never seen any coloured fellas
around the tables at Vegas.

09:05.298 --> 09:08.384
I oughta tell the boys to let 'em in.

09:08.510 --> 09:13.515
Christ's sakes. For Christ's sakes,
nobody likes to lose... like the Negroes.

09:14.807 --> 09:18.520
They're born losers.
You know what I oughta do?

09:18.645 --> 09:21.898
I oughta build a casino
right out in the desert.

09:22.023 --> 09:24.526
Just for the nigger trade.

09:24.651 --> 09:28.613
I bet they'd hitchhike, ride the rails,
even steal cars to get there.

09:43.461 --> 09:47.131
- Be right with you, sir.
- That's OK.

09:47.257 --> 09:52.929
Take your time. I want Mr Grossfield to
look his best for his friends and relatives.

09:54.889 --> 09:58.559
- Who the hell are you?
- Did you know that a man's beard

09:58.685 --> 10:03.064
keeps right on growin'
even after he's... dead?

10:03.189 --> 10:08.152
Now, you get it real close, Sammy.
We want it to last Mr Grossfield.

10:09.070 --> 10:12.490
You're full of shit. You ain't got no gun.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.081
Keep right on workin', boys.

10:21.124 --> 10:26.004
This doesn't make any sense. I don't know
who sent you, but we can work it out.

10:26.129 --> 10:29.424
Nobody sent me.
I thought it up all by myself.

10:31.092 --> 10:34.345
- Sorry, sir.
- Sammy, don't disfigure the man!

10:34.470 --> 10:39.058
I was plannin' on givin' it to him where
it didn't show. You're makin' a mess.

10:39.183 --> 10:42.437
Look, can't we talk this out?
What do we say?

10:42.562 --> 10:48.443
I'm just as nervous as you are.
This is the first time for both of us.

10:48.568 --> 10:51.863
I ain't never killed anybody before.

10:51.988 --> 10:55.867
I'm just tryin' to break
into the business. At the top.

10:55.992 --> 11:00.788
Look, I haven't got a gun. It's in my coat.
Now, come on, give me a chance.

11:00.913 --> 11:04.208
- Sorry, sir.
- My hand's shakin' too.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.085
- Will you be careful?!
- Sorry.

11:06.210 --> 11:09.881
The organisation is not gonna
let you get away with it.

11:10.006 --> 11:14.469
There's already a contract out on you.
Cardoza wrote it.

11:14.594 --> 11:18.055
That's right. Your friend Cardoza.

11:18.181 --> 11:22.185
I'm just... savin' him time.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.687
By volunteerin'.

11:36.073 --> 11:39.952
Oh, say, you did a sloppy job, Sammy.

11:40.077 --> 11:43.164
I ain't gonna let you shave me.

12:09.524 --> 12:13.569
- Jesus Christ!
- Sauce looked like it needed more meat.

12:13.694 --> 12:15.863
What are you doin'? Who are you?

12:15.988 --> 12:19.909
Just a jig who heard
Grossfield needed killing.

12:21.452 --> 12:23.955
That contract was only for professionals.

12:24.080 --> 12:29.460
Don't I qualify? I spent eight years
in some of your best private institutions.

12:29.585 --> 12:32.421
- It was a clean job.
- You call that a clean job?

12:32.547 --> 12:35.550
In the afternoon, in a barbershop,
with witnesses?

12:35.675 --> 12:38.177
That's why I did it in front of everybody.

12:38.302 --> 12:41.806
Everybody knows your... organisation

12:41.931 --> 12:44.600
don't employ no niggers.

12:45.226 --> 12:47.478
Sit down.

12:53.359 --> 12:55.486
Uh...

12:55.611 --> 12:58.281
Want somethin' to eat?

13:00.199 --> 13:05.246
<i>Peppe in un piatto di rigatoni.</i>

13:05.371 --> 13:10.793
<i>E per me un piatto di spaghetti.</i>

13:10.918 --> 13:14.088
Where did you learn to speak our language?

13:14.213 --> 13:16.841
One of my cellmates was a Sicilian kid.

13:16.966 --> 13:19.010
Yeah?

13:19.135 --> 13:22.096
I ain't never heard no dinge
speak Italian before.

13:22.221 --> 13:24.890
How many of us do you know?

13:25.725 --> 13:29.103
- You get your 200.
- Since when did the price go down?

13:29.228 --> 13:31.689
Since when do spades
make as much as whites?

13:31.814 --> 13:35.818
Listen, shadow, you're lucky
I'm even talkin' to you.

13:35.943 --> 13:39.155
Look, you may wanna use me again.
Don't screw it up.

13:39.280 --> 13:44.243
No, I don't use the same man in the same
city twice. They can be easily identified.

13:44.368 --> 13:46.328
I got a built-in disguise.

13:46.454 --> 13:50.958
They never look at me. They never
look at my face, my nose, my lame foot.

13:51.083 --> 13:54.336
- All they know is that I'm black.
- Your kind has no guts.

13:54.462 --> 13:57.339
If you get picked up,
right away they start to talk.

13:57.465 --> 14:02.762
You know what the other families'd do if I
hired you? They'd scream bloody murder.

14:02.887 --> 14:04.388
Nah.

14:04.513 --> 14:07.850
You can't work for me.
The other families won't let me do it.

14:07.975 --> 14:12.646
I don't want a job.
I want one full block to call my territory.

14:12.772 --> 14:15.274
127th Street and Edgecomb Avenue.

14:15.399 --> 14:18.527
- Why do you want that? It's shit.
- I'll make it work.

14:18.652 --> 14:22.782
Hey. Who says spooks
don't have any ambition?

14:22.907 --> 14:25.451
You don't know what you're gettin' into.

14:25.576 --> 14:28.871
There might be a whole load
of people I wanna get rid of.

14:28.996 --> 14:31.248
You might not have a good deal after all.

14:31.373 --> 14:34.585
So I put in a little overtime.

14:35.628 --> 14:37.463
<i>Salute.</i>

14:41.884 --> 14:44.553
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

14:46.889 --> 14:49.767
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

14:51.519 --> 14:55.022
<i>I've paid the cost to be the boss</i>

14:56.732 --> 14:58.275
<i>Look at me</i>

14:58.776 --> 15:01.153
<i>You know what you see</i>

15:01.278 --> 15:03.447
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

15:06.283 --> 15:08.577
<i>Look at me</i>

15:08.702 --> 15:11.038
<i>You know what you see</i>

15:11.163 --> 15:12.832
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

15:16.418 --> 15:19.046
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

15:21.257 --> 15:23.259
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

15:25.803 --> 15:27.805
<i>Look at me</i>

15:27.930 --> 15:30.558
<i>You know what you see</i>

15:30.683 --> 15:32.935
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

15:48.826 --> 15:50.411
<i>Told you so</i>

15:52.997 --> 15:55.457
<i>Told you so</i>

15:55.583 --> 15:59.295
<i>Havin' fun, I got money for it</i>

16:00.462 --> 16:03.549
<i>Havin' fun, I got mighty fun</i>

16:05.259 --> 16:08.846
<i>Havin' fun, I got mighty fun</i>

16:10.180 --> 16:14.101
<i>Havin' fun, I got mighty fun</i>

16:16.854 --> 16:21.567
Never fear, brother, I'm always here
to save the souls and heal the ills.

16:21.692 --> 16:23.944
And cash the cheques.

16:24.653 --> 16:29.366
You see, uh, religious organisations
is tax-exempt. Privilege, you know?

16:29.491 --> 16:32.161
When we shake folks down,
they're not payin' Tommy,

16:32.286 --> 16:36.874
they're supportin' my religious
organisation. And it all goes into a fund.

16:36.999 --> 16:39.543
And we don't even have to hide the moneys

16:39.668 --> 16:42.629
that we make from hookers and the numbers.

16:42.755 --> 16:49.636
And we report it and use it tax-free
to buy filling stations, supermarkets,

16:49.762 --> 16:55.059
apartment houses - everything,
anything Joe the brain can think up.

16:55.184 --> 16:59.146
We intend to do more than just
organise the rackets in Harlem,

16:59.271 --> 17:03.901
we're going to see that black people
get a fair shake. A chance to live better.

17:04.026 --> 17:06.694
Isn't that right, Tommy?

17:07.488 --> 17:11.492
I understand you're well-connected
at the city hall, Mr Coleman.

17:11.617 --> 17:14.368
Have you ever heard of
a man called Gusick?

17:14.494 --> 17:20.541
He's been the bagman...
for certain... public servants...

17:20.666 --> 17:22.544
since I was a snot-nosed kid.

17:22.669 --> 17:26.548
What happened is the families
that had been making the payoff

17:26.673 --> 17:31.178
have finally demanded an accounting.
An audit, you might say.

17:31.303 --> 17:36.016
Don't tell me this... Gusick
was foolish enough to keep ledgers?

17:36.141 --> 17:40.395
I'm afraid so. I saw these ledgers once
when I was a little boy.

17:40.521 --> 17:45.484
Just a couple of ordinary books
with a lot of facts and names.

17:45.609 --> 17:47.986
But... oh, what names.

17:48.112 --> 17:50.989
Cops, councilmen, congressmen.

17:51.115 --> 17:54.868
- They must be carefully hidden.
- In a safe-deposit box.

17:54.993 --> 17:57.746
But... to show that he's clean,

17:57.871 --> 18:02.793
he has to take the books out and deliver
them for examination periodically.

18:02.918 --> 18:06.630
- That's what you were waiting for?
- I thought you'd understand.

18:06.755 --> 18:10.092
Once you've acquired possession
of this material,

18:10.217 --> 18:13.387
you wish me to represent your interests.

18:14.304 --> 18:17.182
I don't think we should
discuss social reform

18:17.307 --> 18:22.771
until after you've acquired control
of these celebrated ledgers.

19:09.985 --> 19:12.654
- How are you, huh?
- Oh, I'm good.

19:21.288 --> 19:23.540
- Inspire me. Pick me up.
- Oh, honey, no.

19:24.166 --> 19:27.878
- What?
- This place has been crowded all night.

19:28.003 --> 19:32.341
I've had it up to here. They're pinching
my ass and thinking I'm a prostitute.

19:32.466 --> 19:34.301
I'll talk to 'em. Come on.

19:34.426 --> 19:37.846
Oh, baby, please. Come on.

19:37.971 --> 19:43.769
Just play a couple of tunes for me? I'm not
askin' much, just play a couple of tunes.

19:47.230 --> 19:51.026
- What do you wanna hear?
- Doesn't matter, just make it loud.

19:57.199 --> 19:59.659
What are you doing?

20:02.079 --> 20:03.897
Just play.

20:14.674 --> 20:17.219
Whatever you do, don't stop playin'.

20:23.767 --> 20:28.730
He was big, he was bad,
just as bad as he could be

20:30.899 --> 20:36.279
He was the baddest man these eyes
of mine could ever hope to see

20:38.115 --> 20:43.370
He was mine, all mine,
a big daddy just for me

20:45.122 --> 20:47.582
Come back home, big daddy

20:48.625 --> 20:52.087
Your little girl is waitin' for you

20:52.212 --> 20:54.840
Come on home, big daddy

20:55.340 --> 20:59.261
And do me the way you used to do

20:59.386 --> 21:03.932
Make me laugh, make me cry,
how you satisfied

21:04.057 --> 21:05.433
Big daddy

21:05.976 --> 21:07.644
Big daddy

21:45.056 --> 21:49.895
Come on, baby, let's go home now.
No more workin' for those two-bit tips.

21:50.020 --> 21:54.024
You know what this is? Huh?
Power. Political power.

21:58.028 --> 22:00.071
Come on.

22:09.664 --> 22:13.877
As of today, we're branchin' out
into new fields.

22:14.002 --> 22:19.966
Instead of just shaking down the white
landlords, we're going to work with them.

22:20.091 --> 22:23.386
- Isn't that right, Tommy?
- Oh, yeah, Joe. That's great.

22:23.511 --> 22:26.556
We'll see that those apartments
got heat in the winter.

22:26.681 --> 22:30.602
That ought to convince those black people
we got their welfare at heart.

22:30.727 --> 22:35.523
We'll make sure their garbage is dropped
off in them white neighbourhoods.

22:35.649 --> 22:38.735
- Yeah. Right on.
- It's nearly time.

22:39.402 --> 22:42.906
Everything's blue chip, growth potential.

22:44.366 --> 22:47.869
Well, it's too good for that mick bastard.

22:47.994 --> 22:50.664
Craw! Here y'are.

22:50.789 --> 22:53.083
Joe.

22:53.208 --> 22:58.296
And, Mr Coleman, here's something for
your lovely wife, straight from Tiffany's.

22:58.421 --> 23:01.341
All right, vanish.
I got business to take care of.

23:01.466 --> 23:05.178
Uh, I'd advise they use
the freight elevator.

23:07.722 --> 23:12.018
- Shall I lock the ledgers away?
- Leave 'em there. I want him to see 'em.

23:12.143 --> 23:14.479
You just sit tight.

23:14.604 --> 23:16.856
Have him come in.

23:21.986 --> 23:26.366
Captain McKinney,
I believe you know Mr Gibbs.

23:30.036 --> 23:33.123
Somebody call down for a shine?

23:33.248 --> 23:36.668
It's time you two forgot
your past differences.

23:36.793 --> 23:42.590
It was Mr Gibbs' experts that assembled
this stock portfolio for you in your name.

23:42.715 --> 23:47.804
All blue-chip companies.
Preferred stocks, bonds, mutual funds.

23:47.929 --> 23:50.849
Better than that envelope
under the table, McKinney.

23:50.974 --> 23:55.937
Security. An investment
in the future... for your family.

23:58.857 --> 24:01.317
Oh, uh, I've started a new collection.

24:01.442 --> 24:06.322
I'm collecting old books now.
Those date back to 1955.

24:06.447 --> 24:13.079
A lot of very interesting characters.
Sort of a... success story, you might say.

24:13.204 --> 24:16.457
I could pin murder one on you
for possession of those books.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.835
I'm talking facts, McKinney.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.297
And you are mouthing make-believe garbage.

24:22.422 --> 24:26.551
Naturally, we'll be adding
to this portfolio regularly.

24:26.676 --> 24:31.639
Looking after your interests...
as you'll look after ours.

24:46.237 --> 24:51.409
Right now you're high as a junkie
with a hundred-dollar habit.

24:51.534 --> 24:56.039
But everybody crashes... limpy.

24:57.749 --> 25:00.209
And I'll be around.

25:01.002 --> 25:04.297
Well, that's, uh, fine, McKinney.

25:05.423 --> 25:09.010
You gave me my education.
I'm gonna put your kids through college.

25:09.135 --> 25:13.806
Best of luck with the Dow Jones,
and good afternoon, Captain.

25:27.904 --> 25:30.114
Nothing to be gained by antagonising him.

25:30.239 --> 25:33.618
Runs the most important
precinct in Manhattan.

25:33.743 --> 25:38.581
- He'll be commissioner.
- I want him nice and fat...

25:38.706 --> 25:41.167
before I kill him.

25:41.959 --> 25:44.337
Now... partner...

25:45.296 --> 25:49.384
let's, uh, lock up those books...

25:49.509 --> 25:52.929
and then you can introduce me
to that family of yours

25:53.054 --> 25:55.932
you promised I could meet.

25:56.057 --> 25:58.393
All right.

25:59.394 --> 26:05.108
<i>Nice view of the East Side.
Shame, I understand it ain't safe no more.</i>

26:05.233 --> 26:09.946
<i>You never know when someone
might be hiding in the elevator,</i>

26:10.071 --> 26:13.282
<i>or in the lobby, or even in your own pad.</i>

26:14.826 --> 26:17.995
I've always wanted me a pad like this.

26:18.121 --> 26:22.250
But seein' as how you're my number-one
man, I'm gonna do you a favour.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.919
I'm gonna buy your apartment.

26:25.044 --> 26:28.339
- We weren't selling.
- I thought everybody was leavin'.

26:28.464 --> 26:31.551
The whole city is dangerous.

26:38.099 --> 26:40.935
It's all made out. Signed and certified.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.479
That's for everything.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.899
The furniture.
All the clothes in the closet.

26:47.733 --> 26:53.114
Well, that's... that's an awful lot of money,
but we don't need money at the moment.

26:53.239 --> 26:55.366
Thanks to you.

26:55.491 --> 26:58.327
- I'll have Abi help me pack.
- The maid stays with me.

26:58.453 --> 27:02.165
Help is a bitch to find these days.

27:04.625 --> 27:10.715
- I can't imagine why you want our things.
- I grew up wearing your things, mister.

27:12.175 --> 27:16.888
Everything you wore out,
got dirty, or you outgrew.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.807
I even ate your leftovers.

27:22.018 --> 27:24.020
Who the hell are you?

27:24.145 --> 27:28.274
Alfred, I think we better go
before you get hurt.

27:36.199 --> 27:39.952
Our, uh, our partnership,
that still continues?

27:40.453 --> 27:43.581
If you want it. You're a good lawyer.

27:43.706 --> 27:47.293
I trust you, uh,
have my interests at heart.

27:47.418 --> 27:48.920
Partner.

27:49.045 --> 27:51.839
Sleep well, Mr Gibbs.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.508
I hope you like the mattress.

27:54.634 --> 27:56.677
It's very hard.

28:42.974 --> 28:45.017
Time to get up!

28:47.269 --> 28:50.147
And don't you fret, Mr Albert.

28:51.107 --> 28:55.319
Old Abi gonna take care of you
just like always.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.657
Come on, now.

28:59.782 --> 29:03.285
Come on, now.
Get your... Get your tomato juice.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.997
You sure treats me good!

29:08.332 --> 29:10.167
Tommy!

29:11.711 --> 29:15.840
Mom, I don't think you served me
breakfast in bed since I had chicken pox.

29:15.965 --> 29:19.677
What you doin' in the Colemans' bed?
How you get in here?

29:19.802 --> 29:24.014
Let's see. I think
I'll have me a couple of eggs -

29:24.140 --> 29:27.977
scrambled, the way you used to
make 'em for me. Then some sausage.

29:28.102 --> 29:31.188
And some of that nice burnt toast.

29:32.106 --> 29:34.942
You've been takin' dope.

29:35.067 --> 29:37.027
I knew it.

29:37.153 --> 29:39.989
I knew you were gonna end up a dope fiend.

29:40.114 --> 29:44.118
Yeah. Yeah. I'm on a high, Momma.

29:44.243 --> 29:47.413
Cos this is all mine. I bought it.

29:47.538 --> 29:53.127
- Done bought it?
- Right down to his pyjamas, Momma.

29:53.252 --> 29:56.422
Well, I ain't workin' for you.

29:56.547 --> 29:59.425
You're an ungrateful bum.

30:00.676 --> 30:03.429
I would work for just about anybody...

30:03.554 --> 30:06.056
but you.

30:06.182 --> 30:07.433
I quit.

30:07.558 --> 30:09.560
You can't quit, Momma.

30:09.685 --> 30:14.732
You don't work here.
It's your place. I'm giving it to you.

30:14.857 --> 30:17.318
In this building?

30:17.443 --> 30:20.988
Why, they'd hang me off that terrace.

30:21.113 --> 30:24.700
Jewish folk ain't even allowed in here!

30:25.910 --> 30:29.413
Ain't nobody gonna bother
Tommy Gibbs' momma.

30:30.289 --> 30:33.000
Come on, sit down, relax.

30:33.125 --> 30:36.086
You can sleep till noon.

30:36.212 --> 30:40.591
Then all you have to do is push the buzzer
and they'll bring your breakfast.

30:40.716 --> 30:43.886
Come on, be comfortable.

30:44.011 --> 30:46.764
I'm fixin' to get married.

30:46.889 --> 30:51.310
She's a nice girl, too.
She's a singer. Her name's Helen.

30:51.810 --> 30:54.647
I'll get a couple of white girls
to do your cleaning.

30:54.772 --> 30:59.526
I'll get you a snooty chauffeur
to drive you around Saks Fifth Avenue.

30:59.652 --> 31:03.614
Anything you want.
All you gotta do is ask.

31:04.531 --> 31:06.742
I wouldn't know how.

31:06.867 --> 31:09.662
I wouldn't know what to say to them.

31:18.462 --> 31:20.714
I'm a maid, Tommy.

31:24.551 --> 31:27.513
You never could see that.

31:27.638 --> 31:29.473
Momma...

31:41.318 --> 31:44.113
<i>I can't stand it when
you hold my hand, and, uh</i>

31:45.489 --> 31:49.535
<i>I can't stand it when
you call me a natural-born lover man</i>

31:49.660 --> 31:53.622
<i>I can't love it when you say
"Baby, please don't go"</i>

31:53.747 --> 31:57.376
<i>I don't need to, baby,
cos I want some more</i>

31:57.501 --> 32:01.839
<i>I said love me baby, love me
like you never, never, never did before</i>

32:01.964 --> 32:05.134
<i>Kiss me, squeeze me, huh,
make me want some more</i>

32:05.259 --> 32:07.845
<i>Cos I know that I need you</i>

32:07.970 --> 32:09.763
<i>I know that I need you</i>

32:09.888 --> 32:11.849
<i>You know that I need you</i>

32:11.974 --> 32:15.394
<i>You know that I, and that I,
and that I, I said I need you</i>

32:15.519 --> 32:17.438
<i>And I need you</i>

32:17.563 --> 32:20.023
<i>Now, babe, can I make you dirty</i>

32:20.149 --> 32:22.067
<i>Can I make you join the band</i>

32:22.192 --> 32:24.111
<i>Can I make you boogie</i>

32:24.236 --> 32:26.530
<i>Can I, can I</i>

32:30.701 --> 32:32.745
<i>Come on, darlin'</i>

32:34.705 --> 32:37.583
<i>I've got it bad, come on, do it</i>

32:42.963 --> 32:44.590
<i>Bad</i>

32:47.342 --> 32:49.386
<i>Tell me, can I make you</i>

32:49.511 --> 32:55.726
Do you believe my hands can heal? Heal
the mind, heal the body, heal the soul.

32:55.851 --> 33:01.023
Say "I believe!" Let me hear you.
Say "I believe", children. Say "I believe."

33:01.565 --> 33:04.610
- I believe.
- Jesus.

33:04.735 --> 33:08.280
Jesus Christ, Momma.
Momma, what are you doin' here?

33:08.405 --> 33:11.575
You're a good boy, Rufus.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.995
You always was... a good boy.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.457
Momma... Tommy know you're here?

33:18.582 --> 33:21.043
Pray for him, Rufus.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.255
- Pray for my boy.
- Yes, Lord.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.049
Amen, Lord.

33:27.174 --> 33:29.426
Yes, ma'am. OK.

33:29.551 --> 33:32.012
Do you believe my hands can heal?!

33:32.221 --> 33:35.057
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, God!

33:35.182 --> 33:40.354
Say "I believe!"
Say "I believe my hands can heal!"

33:51.240 --> 33:54.159
<i>Ehi, Tommaso, come stai?</i> How are you?

33:55.619 --> 33:57.412
- How you doin'?
- Fantastic.

33:57.537 --> 34:00.374
- You order for me.
- It's been taken care of.

34:00.499 --> 34:04.586
Those coloured boys you ordered
from Philadelphia and Detroit are great.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.256
They're wonderful and they work cheap.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.175
Hey! Who says Lincoln freed the slaves?

34:10.425 --> 34:12.511
Who, uh... Who Lincoln?

34:12.636 --> 34:18.225
He's some creep who didn't have enough
sense to sit facing the door. No, sit here.

34:18.350 --> 34:21.061
Sit down, Tommy. Sit down.

34:21.186 --> 34:24.273
<i>Come vanno gli affari?</i>

34:26.525 --> 34:32.489
Hey, you knock me out every time you
talk Sicilian. It's like a dubbed-in movie.

34:34.366 --> 34:37.703
Hey, you know, Mr Cardoza,
you built up a great business.

34:37.828 --> 34:42.040
Garbage trucks, Shylocks, policy.

34:42.165 --> 34:45.877
But, like all big companies,
the founder gets kicked upstairs.

34:46.003 --> 34:51.800
Becomes chairman of the board or
somethin'. Kinda gets pensioned off.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.761
Nah. Not in my family.

34:54.886 --> 34:59.808
In Sicily, my father ran his village until
he was 84 years old. He and his brothers.

34:59.933 --> 35:03.979
It's no problem! As far as
the national organisation is concerned,

35:04.104 --> 35:06.690
we want them to think
you're still in charge.

35:06.815 --> 35:11.653
You will be the white face so everybody
will make it easier to swallow.

35:11.778 --> 35:14.406
What do you call it?
What do you call it? Uh...

35:14.531 --> 35:16.867
Token white, huh?

35:17.659 --> 35:21.371
Hey, come on, Tommy,
it's not funny any more.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.542
You!

35:25.667 --> 35:29.421
You black bastard! Hey, Nino!

35:30.047 --> 35:31.506
Nino!

35:31.631 --> 35:33.383
Nino! Nino!

35:40.265 --> 35:42.809
You forget, huh?

35:42.934 --> 35:47.189
You let niggers into your operation,
you make fools of your people.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.733
You shame 'em.

35:49.858 --> 35:52.155
They kill you.

35:53.153 --> 35:56.656
You do this to me
after I gave you your chance?

35:58.283 --> 36:01.536
Who else I'm gonna do it to, huh?

36:02.078 --> 36:04.080
- No, please, don't.
- Huh?

36:04.206 --> 36:09.252
Hey, Jesus Christ, don't shit.
Do you think I'd kill my best friend? Huh?

36:09.377 --> 36:13.089
Present. Engraved from Tiffany's.

36:13.215 --> 36:15.926
First-class merchandise.

36:16.051 --> 36:18.553
Now, who says I'm ungrateful, huh?

36:18.678 --> 36:20.722
Open it.

36:20.847 --> 36:22.891
Go on.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.021
Open.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.332
You can do this to me?

36:47.457 --> 36:50.460
You can take everything away
from me and give me this?

36:50.585 --> 36:53.755
- A present? You black bastard!
- Hey.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.550
You still get your cut every week.

36:56.675 --> 37:01.555
Of course, uh, being Italian,
it's not the same as if you were Negro.

37:05.183 --> 37:07.727
You black son of a bitch,
you won't live that long.

37:07.852 --> 37:12.482
My brothers on the coast'll see to that.
They warned me. I should've listened.

37:12.607 --> 37:18.363
They'll look out for me now. You wait,
you son of a bitch! You wait! You wait!

37:19.572 --> 37:25.704
I heard California was a nice place to visit
this time of year, huh? That right?

40:23.881 --> 40:27.802
Looks like I missed one hell of a party.

40:27.927 --> 40:30.179
I just picked him up at JFK.

40:30.305 --> 40:33.391
Just off a flight from Mexico City.

40:33.516 --> 40:38.021
- Did you check on his whereabouts?
- Yeah. He was in jail on a traffic violation.

40:38.146 --> 40:39.981
He's clean.

40:40.106 --> 40:44.319
That was some botched job
you pulled out in California.

40:45.445 --> 40:48.072
I don't read the paper.

40:48.948 --> 40:51.617
All three Cardoza brothers.

40:51.743 --> 40:56.497
You don't expect the national
organisation to sit still for that?

40:59.917 --> 41:02.045
It don't matter.

41:02.170 --> 41:08.176
They're giving me all of Cardoza's
territory and the South Bronx thrown in.

41:09.135 --> 41:12.680
Bullshit. They'd never accept
a nigger into the syndicate.

41:12.805 --> 41:17.018
Everybody's a liberal nowadays,
McKinney. Get with it.

41:17.143 --> 41:19.520
I guarantee it.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.940
You're one dead coon
by the end of the week.

41:38.581 --> 41:42.710
Gentlemen, good evening.
Won't you sit down?

41:52.136 --> 41:56.265
Now, let's take a look at Harlem.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.937
You tell me who's gonna
control these people.

42:01.062 --> 42:06.234
But... those goddamn
Puerto Ricans and those niggers,

42:06.359 --> 42:10.696
they're too stupid to be afraid.
They'll stick a chiv in anybody.

42:10.822 --> 42:13.074
It's a jungle.

42:13.199 --> 42:15.660
And it takes a jungle bunny to run it.

42:15.785 --> 42:20.414
I'll keep my hands off the docks.
I'll keep my hands off the unions.

42:20.540 --> 42:24.210
I'll keep my hands off the narcotics.

42:24.335 --> 42:30.466
And I promise you this -
that things will be quiet in the ghetto.

42:30.591 --> 42:36.097
Not only here, but in Philly,
Chicago, Detroit, LA.

42:36.222 --> 42:39.225
I'll keep 'em in line.

42:39.767 --> 42:44.063
And now, may I wish you gentlemen...

42:44.188 --> 42:47.608
a merry... merry Christmas.

42:53.531 --> 42:56.826
<i>Woke up this morning</i>

42:56.951 --> 42:59.745
<i>Booze all around my bed</i>

43:00.705 --> 43:05.877
<i>Didn't have nobody to cool my achin' head</i>

43:06.502 --> 43:08.546
<i>But deal with it</i>

43:10.214 --> 43:12.717
<i>That's the key</i>

43:12.842 --> 43:18.723
What is this cold routine you're giving me,
huh? You don't have to be afraid of me.

43:18.848 --> 43:23.603
Everybody else does, but you
don't have to be afraid of me, Helen.

43:29.358 --> 43:31.277
Stop it, please.

43:31.402 --> 43:32.945
Don't do that.

43:33.070 --> 43:35.364
Please, give me time.

43:35.489 --> 43:37.533
I gotta think about it.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.202
I got a lot to think about, OK?

43:40.995 --> 43:42.747
Tommy, stop it, please.

43:42.872 --> 43:47.376
This is the only way you like it, huh?
You have to be raped. I got no objections.

43:47.501 --> 43:49.337
Stop it!

43:50.338 --> 43:53.007
Don't you do this to me.

43:56.135 --> 43:58.429
Agh! Stop it!

43:58.554 --> 43:59.388
No.

43:59.513 --> 44:01.682
No. Let me go.

44:01.807 --> 44:04.894
Let me go. Let me go!

44:06.896 --> 44:09.023
Stop it, you bastard!

44:09.148 --> 44:12.610
You dirty bastard!
You killer! You murderer!

44:12.735 --> 44:15.488
You're no good! Let me go!

44:15.613 --> 44:17.948
Let me go! Stop it!

44:18.532 --> 44:21.160
Oh! No.

44:21.285 --> 44:23.996
No. No. No.

44:24.372 --> 44:26.874
Let me hear you say "Amen".

44:26.999 --> 44:30.086
Let me hear you say "Hallelujah".

44:30.211 --> 44:35.299
Lord have mercy on my soul, am I glad
to see such beautiful young people here.

44:35.424 --> 44:37.635
- What's your name, brother?
- Beverly.

44:37.760 --> 44:40.846
My name's Reverend Rufus.
Come to my congregation.

44:40.971 --> 44:46.102
Rufus' Convent Avenue Baptist Church,
on 145th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

44:46.227 --> 44:49.397
Yeah, we need some
young strong men like you there.

44:49.522 --> 44:52.400
And go with God, huh? Thank you, Jesus.

44:52.525 --> 44:54.110
- Hallelujah.
- Excuse me.

44:54.235 --> 44:58.364
How you doin', sister? What's your name?
What's your name, young lady?

44:58.489 --> 45:00.574
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Jesus.

45:00.699 --> 45:02.785
- Is that Mr Gibbs' car?
- Yes, it is.

45:02.910 --> 45:04.995
- I'd like to see him.
- Call his office.

45:05.121 --> 45:08.290
- My name is Gibbs too.
- You should have been a relative.

45:08.415 --> 45:11.043
Well, I am. I'm his father.

45:11.168 --> 45:16.048
Well, I was just across...
just comin' into the bar for a drink.

45:16.173 --> 45:18.467
I sell, you know. Cosmetics.

45:18.592 --> 45:21.512
Mainly for coloured folks in the south.

45:21.637 --> 45:24.431
I only been in town for a few days,

45:24.557 --> 45:29.353
and it was a coincidence
to be seein' you across the street.

45:29.478 --> 45:32.940
It'd have been wrong if I didn't
take advantage of that.

45:33.065 --> 45:35.568
You wanna go up and see Mom?

45:35.693 --> 45:39.238
Well, your mom and I didn't get along.

45:39.363 --> 45:42.032
You do recollect me, son?

45:43.909 --> 45:45.953
Look at me.

45:49.999 --> 45:54.628
Hey, you remember Rufus? He used to
live next door to us. He's a preacher now.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.214
Young Rufus.

45:57.339 --> 45:59.592
He was always a bad boy.

45:59.717 --> 46:03.345
Never thought he'd take up religion.

46:03.470 --> 46:07.099
Hey, Pop, uh, like to take a ride,
look at the old neighbourhood?

46:07.224 --> 46:10.436
We want Tommy! We want Tommy!

46:10.561 --> 46:12.354
We want Tommy!

46:12.605 --> 46:14.273
We want Tommy!

46:14.523 --> 46:16.191
We want Tommy!

46:16.442 --> 46:17.902
We want Tommy!

46:18.027 --> 46:19.778
Take my advice.

46:19.904 --> 46:22.197
Get out. Go home.

46:22.323 --> 46:25.784
Well, now, I... I can understand
my son sayin' that,

46:25.910 --> 46:29.622
but why should you
feel that way towards me?

46:31.582 --> 46:33.626
Please. Listen to me.

46:33.751 --> 46:35.377
We want Tommy!

46:35.502 --> 46:38.589
We want Tommy! We want Tommy!

46:48.849 --> 46:50.309
Pull over.

47:15.876 --> 47:21.131
That used to be home sweet home, Pa.
Top window. Rear.

47:21.256 --> 47:24.843
Always seemed to me
like a much bigger building.

47:26.428 --> 47:29.723
You must know what I do for a livin'.

47:31.850 --> 47:34.436
I'm not gonna lecture you.

47:34.561 --> 47:36.814
I don't have the right.

47:40.442 --> 47:43.320
Did it ever occur to you...

47:44.613 --> 47:48.659
that I've been waitin' 25 years
just to kill you?

47:49.451 --> 47:50.744
No.

47:50.869 --> 47:55.457
No, wait. Listen. Please.
It was the Depression.

47:56.083 --> 48:00.921
You don't know what it was like to...
Then the war, and my chance to get away.

48:01.046 --> 48:06.427
You never had those responsibilities.
You've never been trapped.

48:07.594 --> 48:11.682
Or not knowin' where to run
or-or who to hate.

48:12.850 --> 48:17.146
I was 20 years old - 20 years old -
when I enlisted.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.942
And-and I was a cook all through the war.
I was a cook!

48:22.067 --> 48:25.612
You never sent home one allotment cheque.

48:25.737 --> 48:29.700
My ma had to scrub floors
on her hands and knees for pennies!

48:29.825 --> 48:31.952
I'm gonna kill you!

48:32.077 --> 48:36.665
She couldn't get no allotment.
We wasn't married legal!

48:36.790 --> 48:39.877
Folks didn't bother much in those days.

48:45.090 --> 48:49.511
- She never told me.
- I... I could've sent you somethin'.

48:51.805 --> 48:54.725
Go on. Start walkin'.

48:55.267 --> 48:57.895
I didn't mean to break it to you that way.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.898
- I wouldn't have said it...
- It don't matter.

49:01.023 --> 49:04.318
Just... move on before I change my mind.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.571
Pa!

49:08.530 --> 49:11.408
I don't ever wanna see you again.

49:12.367 --> 49:14.411
I understand, son.

49:27.341 --> 49:29.551
What are you gonna do now?

49:29.676 --> 49:31.720
Kill your momma?

49:35.724 --> 49:40.312
Bullshit. No cuts, no rake-offs,
no palefaces in my territory.

49:40.437 --> 49:43.941
Send your boys in,
I'll send them back in a paper bag!

49:51.365 --> 49:54.868
How'd you like that, huh?
I did pretty good, huh?

49:57.120 --> 50:02.292
Hey, hey. Wait, wait. I got something
to take to California with you, huh?

50:03.126 --> 50:07.089
All the way from
Bergdorf Goodman, Fifth Avenue.

50:07.923 --> 50:10.384
Open it! Open it!

50:12.469 --> 50:16.765
Every time I give somebody something,
they don't appreciate it.

50:19.976 --> 50:25.065
Maybe now we can relax a little,
get those youth centres built.

50:25.190 --> 50:27.234
Help the people a little.

50:27.359 --> 50:29.194
Joe...

50:29.319 --> 50:32.155
Some genius you are!

50:32.280 --> 50:35.534
They're gettin' ready to hit us. Hard.

50:35.659 --> 50:39.996
I'm gonna import some muscle
from Detroit and Philly.

50:40.122 --> 50:43.208
We've gotta tighten up on our security.

50:48.338 --> 50:51.383
Things are gonna get
a little messy around here.

50:51.508 --> 50:53.802
I don't want Helen to get hurt.

50:53.927 --> 50:56.179
You either.

50:56.304 --> 51:00.517
So what I want you to do
is take Helen to California.

51:00.642 --> 51:06.857
Buy one of those, uh, big houses.
You know, out in Beverly Hills someplace.

51:07.858 --> 51:11.611
Get a record company for her.
Set her up in the recording business.

51:11.736 --> 51:15.740
If her records don't sell,
you buy 'em. OK?

51:16.867 --> 51:19.327
I'll be out when I can.

51:46.229 --> 51:48.481
<i>Momma's dead</i>

51:52.527 --> 51:57.365
<i>Never again will she hold my hand</i>

51:57.490 --> 52:00.160
I gave her the best.

52:07.334 --> 52:10.754
I never really made her happy, Rufus.

52:10.879 --> 52:13.548
I'd like to pray for her.

52:15.383 --> 52:17.427
I really would.

52:20.388 --> 52:25.143
I kinda feel... I could pray for her.

52:27.979 --> 52:30.023
Go ahead.

52:32.025 --> 52:35.320
She always said
you were a good kid, Rufus.

52:38.114 --> 52:40.659
If it means that much to you.

52:43.370 --> 52:46.873
<i>My momma's dead</i>

52:49.000 --> 52:53.421
Oh, Lord, have mercy
on this poor black woman's soul.

52:53.964 --> 52:58.802
For all she ever wanted to do
was to bring her baby into this world,

52:58.927 --> 53:05.141
and work for him, love him, raise him like
every other black woman on this earth.

53:06.559 --> 53:09.646
Please, Lord, let her rest in peace.

53:10.772 --> 53:15.527
No more waitin' on tables, no more
cleanin' other people's houses.

53:15.652 --> 53:18.947
Let this strong black woman...

53:20.365 --> 53:22.701
rest in heaven in peace.

53:29.541 --> 53:31.960
What are you doin' here?

53:32.085 --> 53:35.380
Came by to pay my respects to your momma.

53:37.924 --> 53:40.635
Didn't anybody else come?

53:40.760 --> 53:43.012
Your girl? Or anybody?

53:44.723 --> 53:46.391
No.

53:46.516 --> 53:48.560
They weren't invited.

53:52.439 --> 53:56.568
Invited or not, I come
to say goodbye to that woman.

53:57.944 --> 54:00.405
She was my wife, son.

54:02.157 --> 54:03.783
Pa.

54:08.121 --> 54:09.956
How's everything?

54:10.081 --> 54:11.916
Pardon?

54:13.751 --> 54:16.337
I said...

54:16.463 --> 54:18.506
"You need anything?"

54:19.424 --> 54:21.176
I'm fine.

54:21.301 --> 54:22.927
Thanks.

54:30.602 --> 54:34.355
Would you like to come stay with me, Pa?

54:34.481 --> 54:36.107
No.

54:38.151 --> 54:40.612
I travel a lot.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.828
<i>No one to cry</i>

54:50.079 --> 54:53.124
<i>No one to sit by the bedside</i>

54:55.126 --> 54:59.255
<i>No one to watch the light in my window</i>

55:01.132 --> 55:02.926
<i>No one, no one to come in</i>

55:04.552 --> 55:10.558
<i>Come in and pull the cover
over my head at night</i>

55:23.071 --> 55:24.739
Who invited you?

55:24.864 --> 55:31.079
I kinda missed my old bed. And besides,
I thought you might be lonesome tonight.

55:35.917 --> 55:38.670
Not tonight. Not any night.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.840
Oh, you think my husband wouldn't like it?

55:42.966 --> 55:45.635
I don't think I'd like it.

55:47.637 --> 55:52.267
Why don't you find out what your girl
is doing in California with your friend Joe?

55:52.392 --> 55:54.936
Everybody else knows.

55:55.061 --> 55:57.730
I want my clothes back!

56:20.128 --> 56:22.171
<i>Momma's dead</i>

56:26.217 --> 56:31.556
<i>Never again will she hold my hand</i>

56:36.310 --> 56:42.775
<i>Never again to hear her call my name</i>

57:13.389 --> 57:16.100
How long, Helen?

57:16.225 --> 57:18.728
Tell me. I asked you a question, Helen.

57:18.853 --> 57:21.773
Don't be silly. Nothing's happened.

57:21.898 --> 57:24.358
Come on down, Joe.

57:25.651 --> 57:29.405
Come on down. Let's play.

57:35.745 --> 57:37.914
Tell me about it, Helen.

57:39.207 --> 57:41.626
I wanna hear all the details.

57:42.668 --> 57:45.296
Was he as good as me, Helen?

57:50.092 --> 57:53.387
Tell me about it, Helen. Tell me.

57:53.513 --> 57:58.893
Everybody used to wipe up the street
with him. I protected him.

58:00.019 --> 58:03.814
He was fag bait and I saved his black ass.

58:05.858 --> 58:09.278
I can take care of myself now.

58:17.245 --> 58:19.497
Don't. Stop it.

58:22.124 --> 58:24.794
Oh, no. No.

58:24.919 --> 58:28.631
You shit on me. You shit on me.

58:30.091 --> 58:32.343
No! Don't do it!

58:33.886 --> 58:37.932
He was the only person you could leave
me for who you thought I wouldn't kill!

58:38.057 --> 58:40.268
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

58:40.393 --> 58:43.562
Don't kill him! Please, Tommy, don't.

58:44.522 --> 58:50.027
Tommy, please. Don't kill him, Tommy.
Please don't kill him. Tommy, wait.

58:50.152 --> 58:51.487
Tommy!

58:51.612 --> 58:54.156
Get it over with!

58:54.282 --> 58:57.034
- Stop it!
- Get it over with!

58:58.411 --> 59:01.497
Stop it! Don't you do that to him!

59:01.622 --> 59:03.457
Please!

59:04.542 --> 59:07.795
Tommy, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

59:07.920 --> 59:09.964
Stop it!

59:11.966 --> 59:15.052
Oh, Tommy, just...

59:21.392 --> 59:25.354
I can't let you get away with this.
Make me lose respect.

59:25.479 --> 59:28.232
Cost me plenty - two of my own people.

59:28.357 --> 59:32.319
I'm not one of your people!
You white nigger!

59:32.445 --> 59:35.823
All you wanted was money! Cash!

59:35.948 --> 59:39.827
To live in whitey's house.
And run with his women.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.247
Agh!

59:54.759 --> 59:56.385
Joe!

59:59.638 --> 01:00:05.352
If you knew how to fight, Joe, you coulda
owned the town and everybody in it.

01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:08.564
I never wanted to own anybody.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.028
Oh, baby!

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:16.197
Oh, babe!

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.575
Baby!

01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:24.830
I hate him! I hate him for hurting you!

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:28.083
I hate him. I hate him.

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:48.354
Seems like our little coloured friend
has lost his charm.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.193
Where's the key to the safe-deposit box?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.530
Keeps it with him all the time.

01:00:57.655 --> 01:01:01.951
Long as he has those ledgers...
we can't touch him.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:06.872
What's to stop us from touching
his associates? One by one.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.291
He has the best bodyguards money can buy.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:14.421
How's he gonna react
when you start killing his people?

01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:17.299
He's not gonna know who's doing it.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.286
Uh, you got any suggestions?

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:23.824
We would like to ask you some questions
about your husband Joseph Washington,

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.368
about his association with Thomas Gibbs.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.288
Joe doesn't work for Tommy any more.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:35.502
Mrs Washington, we have enough
evidence to put your husband behind bars

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:38.297
for at least five years.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:45.304
- Why are you telling me about it?
- Because we don't want your husband.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.974
You know damn well that
Tommy and I have been in business.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:51.477
He's had his way long enough.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.645
Now it's my turn.

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.691
But I need a friend.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:00.986
Somebody close to Tommy.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.700
I haven't seen Tommy in two years.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:10.454
Tommy hasn't had
a steady woman since you left.

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.831
He'd be glad to see you.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.756
- I can't do this to him.
- Look what he did to you.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:24.093
From Beverly Hills
to a shitty furnished apartment.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:29.973
You can't get a job as a singer.
Your husband can't get a job as a lawyer.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:34.645
You just had another
nice little baby, didn't you?

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:39.691
You've got responsibilities.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:43.070
I don't think Tommy would
lift a finger to help you.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:45.239
I know he wouldn't.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:53.497
The ledgers again, right?

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:57.292
That's how I first met Tommy.

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.420
He used me.

01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:06.468
This time it'll be for myself.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.594
You can't go in there!

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.939
Just take it easy.
You better do what he says.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.607
- Let me go!
- Take it easy.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:24.653
Do what he says
and everything'll be all right.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:30.075
I just want to remind you -
don't make any mistakes.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.590
Who's there?

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.299
Hello, Helen.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:34.426
- Honey, what you doin', huh?
- Nothing. Just seeing what time it is.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.888
- Come back. Come on.
- It's 2.30.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.351
Joe'll be worried about me.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:46.146
I'll see you Monday afternoon.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.657
Commissioner? Coleman.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.410
I'm at Gibbs' office right now.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.330
<i>Everything went fine.
They're in front of me.</i>

01:08:03.455 --> 01:08:07.917
<i>My connections at the bank and $5,000
to the intendant were quite an investment,</i>

01:08:08.043 --> 01:08:12.422
<i>since there was $50,000 in cash
in addition to the books.</i>

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:16.216
<i>No, that won't be necessary.
I'll be keeping them with me.</i>

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.765
Oh, here's, uh...
I've just seen something.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.935
"1 pm tomorrow, Tiffany's.
Pick up gift for Helen."

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:43.787
Probably went to look for
a parking space. I'll go get him.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.707
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.546
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:40.510
<i>I've paid the cost to be the boss</i>

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.763
<i>Look at me</i>

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.599
<i>You know what you see</i>

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.977
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.606
<i>Look at me</i>

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.359
<i>You know what you see</i>

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:58.736
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.242
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.122
<i>Paid the cost to be the boss</i>

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.084
<i>Look at me</i>

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.879
<i>You know what you see</i>

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:18.256
<i>You see a bad mother</i>

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:32.604
How bad was he hit?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:37.734
If the ambulance reaches him, they'll
finish him before he gets to the hospital.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.287
Get your ass after him,
and don't fuck it up this time.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:30.453
Keep movin'. Keep drivin'.
Across town, I'll tell you where.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.711
Get on his tail. Step on it.

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:56.813
What are you slowin' down for?
Get past that garbage truck!

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.982
Hey, get that garbage truck outta the way!

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:07.615
Up on the sidewalk! I'll give you $500.
Get up on the sidewalk! Come on, man.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:41.774
He's not goin' anywhere. It's causin'
traffic. He'll never make it to Broadway.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.158
Run that light. Run that light!

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:55.663
Step on it, man. Step on it!
Jesus Christ, man, they got guns!

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.224
No! Don't stop!

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:20.438
Look out! Look out! They're gonna shoot!

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.715
Hey! He killed that guy.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.184
Um...

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:44.438
I wanna thank you, Lord, for sendin' me
all... No, not "sendin' me".

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:48.442
For the multitude of sinners
you have sent me here tonight.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:52.738
Yes, Lord, I wanna-a-a-a...

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:55.116
Oh, no, I got it.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:05.000
Look, uh...

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:09.422
I'll see you next to the podium
in a little while, OK?

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:13.634
You came at a most inopportune ti...

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.804
Tried to put me outta the way, Rufus.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:20.349
Good Lord, let me seat you down.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:23.144
Now, let me take a look at that.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.899
You can't go to the hospital with that.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.403
Never would have tried this
without an OK from McKinney.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.906
I don't understand.
Why'd they all run out on me, Rufus?

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.284
I'm glad you came to me.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.163
I gotta get this.38 slug outta me, Rufus.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.457
Hear me, Lord!

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.667
Heal this man!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:49.420
Heal this sinner!

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:54.967
Forgive him for his transgressions
as you have forgiven me for mine!

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:56.802
Yes, Lord!

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:02.725
- Forgive him for his transgressions...
- Rufus! Rufus! I need your help!

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.811
- Heal him, Lord!
- Rufus!

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:08.814
- Oh, listen to me!
- You gotta go to the bank for me!

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.649
Give yourself to the Lord!

01:16:10.774 --> 01:16:13.611
You gotta get the ledgers
outta the safe-deposit box!

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.030
I'm gonna blow the lid off of this town!

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:20.242
Leave the punishment to the Almighty.
Vengeance is his!

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:24.496
- Rufus! Rufus!
- Vengeance is his, sayeth the Lord.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:32.129
Rufus, I got $50,000 in that vault!

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:36.508
Without the love of God
all of us are lost!

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:39.887
- Jesus' money now!
- My money!

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:43.933
It's Jesus' money now.
It's Jesus' money now.

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.936
Hey, Lord!

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:50.522
Save his soul!

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.400
Lord!

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:58.530
Save this sinner! Save another soul!

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.908
Oh, Lord!

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:04.954
Oh, Jesus, Lord.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:12.336
Please, Lord. One more time, sir.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:19.301
Give Momma a kiss. Give Momma a kiss.
Give the baby a kiss.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.356
Hello? Hello, Joe?

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:36.402
Helen? Helen?

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.570
<i>I got trouble.</i>

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:42.574
- Who was it?
- Nobody.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:51.125
What's the matter?

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.960
Nothing.

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.629
- Hello?
- Joe?

01:17:56.964 --> 01:18:02.636
Thought you'd hung the phone up.
Joe, McKinney's makin' his move.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.557
His organisation tried to hit me.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:11.812
The only cards you still hold are
those books. As long as they're safe...

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:17.484
- They're locked in the bank vault.
- OK. I'll meet you at Coleman's office.

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.260
Come on, you black bastard.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:51.435
Don't get back into this. Please.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.354
Honey, Tommy is finished.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.858
I'm only trying to save his life.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.861
You can't save his life.

01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:03.405
Why?

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.578
Why do you say that?

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.372
Nothing. Nothing.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.960
Nothing.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.254
Honey...

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.349
Push the 20th floor.

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:19.606
So... the great brain
decided to show up after all.

01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:22.401
I came to talk business.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:27.072
If you're not satisfied with your split,
we can make other arrangements.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.992
No bullshit. No negotiations.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:33.996
You know why? Because
I've got him by the short hair.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:38.875
And you know who set him up?
That sweet little wife of yours.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:45.465
Oh, sure, she had to ball your best friend
in order to pull it off, but she didn't mind.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:12.070
You killed your partner.
Then you resisted arrest.

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:17.534
- How many of my people did you pay off?
- You oughta know everyone's on the take.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:22.622
I was readin' them ledgers of yours.
Lot of important names in there.

01:23:22.747 --> 01:23:26.042
You just shut your fat mouth, McKinney!

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.589
I brought you a present.

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:36.803
My shoes are all scuffed.

01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:41.558
You shine 'em up for me, boy,
like you used to do.

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:54.571
Pick it up.

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:58.116
Bring it over here.

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.247
Now, you kneel down here.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.458
Shine 'em real good.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.711
I wanna see my face in 'em.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:23.850
I'm in a real hurry,
so you shine them up fast.

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:42.577
Don't be afraid to get your fingers dirty.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.623
That's right.

01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:07.727
You missed your calling. You know that?

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.495
That's it.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.835
Do it, nigger. Do it.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:19.966
You're the dumb nigger, McKinney!
You're gonna die like a field nigger!

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.745
I's gonna make you real pretty, McKinney.

01:26:52.248 --> 01:26:53.624
Yeah.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:57.837
You look good blackfaced, McKinney.

01:26:57.962 --> 01:27:01.466
Your momma wouldn't even
recognise you now, McKinney.

01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:09.682
McKinney.

01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:12.518
Now... I wanna hear you sing.

01:27:12.643 --> 01:27:16.064
Sing me one of them good old
minstrel tunes, McKinney.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.691
I bet you even like Jolson, huh?

01:27:18.816 --> 01:27:23.071
Come on, give me one of them tunes -
"Mammy". Sing "Mammy" for me. Sing!

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.280
- "Mammy"?
- Sing it!

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.823
- "Mammy"?
- Sing it right!

01:27:25.948 --> 01:27:28.826
