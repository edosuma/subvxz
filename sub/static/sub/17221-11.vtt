WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:02.503
.

00:02.536 --> 00:03.437
Rebecca: Gary, I know
we're in a relationship

00:04.372 --> 00:05.206
with no expectations,
but I am laying here

00:05.239 --> 00:08.309
in nothing but
a very tiny silk robe.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.377
I expect a little urgency.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.212
Gary: I-I know.
I have, like,

00:11.245 --> 00:12.146
two more emails to send.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.614
You know, I have
a pretty big day tomorrow.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.782
Rebecca: You have
a big day tomorrow?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.784
I'm trying
that Russian mob case.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.386
There's gonna be
reporters there.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.188
We're even gonna have
a sketch artist.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.056
And I don't want to look tired
in all the drawings.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.524
Gary: Two more minutes,
and I am done.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.326
Rebecca: In two minutes,
I'm gonna be asleep.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.228
I don't have time for this.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.336
[camera shutter clicks]

00:35.369 --> 00:37.771
You just received
a very urgent message

00:37.805 --> 00:38.772
from Rebecca P. Wright.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.242
Gary: Huh?

00:41.275 --> 00:42.276
[exhales excitedly]

00:42.310 --> 00:43.511
You know what?
This can wait.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.215
[door shuts]

00:47.248 --> 00:48.316
Rebecca: Took you long enough.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.084
Gary: Traffic was brutal.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.087
[upbeat music]

00:53.121 --> 01:01.129
*

01:05.333 --> 01:07.501
Tom: Hey, Gary.
Gary: Oh, God.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.270
Hey, Tom.
Wow, your stealth kill approach

01:09.303 --> 01:10.538
is coming along nicely.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.639
Tom: Thank you.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.275
So I wanted to pick your
therapist brain for a second

01:14.308 --> 01:16.744
about this problem that a friend
of mine is having at home.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.280
Gary: Oh, well, you know,
I prefer to talk to people

01:19.313 --> 01:20.848
directly about
their personal problems.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.283
So, you know,
if your friend wants to--

01:22.316 --> 01:23.184
Tom: My friend can't
talk to you about this.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.785
Nor anyone.
All right, he's very shy.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.288
He's got these issues
with his wife.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.257
All right, she's mad
because he's always at work.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.159
Gary: Hmm.
Tom: And now it's getting worse

01:31.192 --> 01:34.795
because he just got assigned
this very important case.

01:34.828 --> 01:38.366
Gary: Oh, is your friend
a lawyer?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.134
Tom: No, it's not
that kind of case.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.802
It's a wooden case.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.371
It's a--
he's a case maker.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.338
Gary: Okay.
Tom: Yes.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.374
And he just got
this really important case,

01:46.407 --> 01:48.609
and when he tells his wife
he has to go work on it,

01:48.642 --> 01:50.344
she picks a fight.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.547
So what would you do
to fix her?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.183
Medication, right?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.450
Mash up some pills

01:56.484 --> 01:59.720
and slip them into her stupid
chia seed yogurt or something?

01:59.753 --> 02:00.854
Gary: No, Tom, don't do that.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.823
You see,
a marriage involves two people.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.492
Maybe your friend,
the case maker,

02:04.525 --> 02:06.394
would consider
couples counseling.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.595
Tom: Oh, no.
That's not gonna happen.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.297
Gary: What?
Tom: All right, I gotta run.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.498
I got a very important case
to work on.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.932
Gary: Uh.
Tom: Legal case.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.267
Not a wooden case.
Gary: Oh.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.335
Tom: I'm not the guy
in the story!

02:14.368 --> 02:15.503
Gary: That's right.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.607
Tedward: All rise.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.410
The honorable
Judge Rebecca Wright presiding.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.911
Rebecca: Please be seated.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.547
All right, we can quiet down,
and we'll go ahead and--

02:26.580 --> 02:27.881
[loud murmuring]

02:27.915 --> 02:30.218
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.320
Let's have a little order here,
all right?

02:32.353 --> 02:36.324
I'm not gonna have my courtroom
turned into a circus sideshow.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.360
I need quiet
in the gallery.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.434
Ah!
I got ya.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.435
I did.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.436
[laughter]

02:48.469 --> 02:50.504
I did.
This is gonna be fun.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.906
All right, so...

02:52.940 --> 02:54.708
Mr. Gukasov.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.210
Before we begin, I understand

02:56.244 --> 02:57.445
you are
a native Russian speaker.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.248
Would you prefer that the court
provide you an interpreter?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.582
Gukasov:
No, I speak good English.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.384
But I don't like
having woman judge.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.386
Is very humiliating.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.554
Rebecca: Oh, really?

03:06.587 --> 03:08.689
Well, if things don't go
your way,

03:08.722 --> 03:10.291
you may never see
a woman again.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.326
[laughter]

03:12.360 --> 03:13.327
Yeah.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.428
Hot room, right?

03:14.462 --> 03:15.563
Judy: You are killing.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.331
Rebecca: Yeah, I got a
tight five on airplane security

03:17.365 --> 03:19.367
I could bust out.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.671
Now that was a good morning,
Tedward.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.905
You know when
you're becoming a judge,

03:24.938 --> 03:28.376
that is exactly the kind of case
you dream of presiding over,

03:28.409 --> 03:32.313
you know, something that you can
really sink your teeth into.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.314
Hernandez:
Rebecca.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.315
Rebecca:
Mm-hmm.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.516
Hernandez:
We have a situation.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.550
Rebecca: Oh, no, no, no, no.
Let me guess, let me guess.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.985
Um...

03:38.018 --> 03:39.253
Your eyebrows just realized

03:39.287 --> 03:40.754
they're supposed
to be gray too?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.256
What?
[Tedward laughs]

03:42.290 --> 03:43.757
That's a good one.
You been saving that one?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.025
Rebecca: No.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.495
Yeah, I have.
[both laughing]

03:47.528 --> 03:49.697
Hernandez: Two weeks ago,
you presided over a case

03:49.730 --> 03:51.265
involving computer fraud.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.232
Rebecca:
Yeah, State v. Corrigan.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.501
Remember that little weasel?
Tedward: Mm-hmm.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.703
Rebecca: He'd stolen people's
credit card information online.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.670
We got him.
Hernandez: Well,

03:56.704 --> 03:57.905
while Mr. Corrigan was
awaiting sentencing,

03:57.938 --> 04:01.309
he decided to pass his time
by hacking into your cell phone

04:01.342 --> 04:03.311
and uploading
one particular photo

04:03.344 --> 04:04.512
to our court's webpage.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.348
Tedward: I told you not to
take that picture of that cloud

04:07.381 --> 04:08.148
that looked like a swastika.

04:08.181 --> 04:11.285
Rebecca: No.
Oh, God, no, no, no.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.720
Oh, I wish it was
the swastika cloud.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.388
No.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.858
No, the other day
I sent Gary a photo.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.328
Of everything.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.194
Tedward: Everything?
Rebecca: Yeah.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.297
And everything
in between everything.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.398
Hernandez: I had our
IT department remove it

04:24.432 --> 04:25.566
from the site immediately,

04:25.599 --> 04:28.369
but I'm afraid the damage
may have already been done.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.838
Rebecca: Oh,
that vindictive little prick.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.074
Tedward, everyone in the
courthouse has seen me naked.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.343
Tedward:
No, no, it doesn't--look...

04:35.376 --> 04:36.977
Nobody looks at
the court's website.

04:37.010 --> 04:37.845
It's a dot-gov address.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.513
Look, you click on it,
it's so boring,

04:39.547 --> 04:40.648
you'll fall asleep.
Trust me.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.915
Rebecca: You know, you're right.
Right?

04:41.949 --> 04:42.916
Nobody looks at that thing.

04:42.950 --> 04:43.917
Tedward:
You're overreacting.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.553
Rebecca: I'm overreacting.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.620
[cameras flickering]

04:46.654 --> 04:48.322
Man: Judge Wright,
who did you send the picture to?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.423
Woman: Is it true
you have a sex tape?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.358
[all talking at once]

04:50.391 --> 04:51.191
Tedward:
Okay, hey, hey.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.826
Look, show a little respect,
please.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.328
Gukasov:
I have strip club.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.496
Maybe you dance for me, huh?

04:55.529 --> 04:56.997
Woman: When did this all
go down?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.899
Rebecca: You said that no one
goes on the court's website.

05:05.539 --> 05:05.739
.

05:05.773 --> 05:06.540
Gary: Okay, so,
Rebecca is on her way,

05:07.441 --> 05:08.208
and she's experiencing
a lot of emotions,

05:08.241 --> 05:09.810
many of which are
being expressed

05:09.843 --> 05:10.844
at high volume toward me,

05:10.878 --> 05:11.945
which I know
is misplaced anger.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.347
But still...

05:13.381 --> 05:14.415
it's kind of terrifying.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.416
Tedward:
Hey, she's right behind me.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.684
Somebody get her a drink.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.685
Tom: I'm on that.
Gary: Okay, you know what?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.553
Let's just reassure her,
this is not a big deal.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.489
You know, just treat her
exactly as we normally do.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.492
Tedward: Right.
Gary: All right?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.594
all: Hey.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.429
Rebecca: I don't need
your sympathy, okay?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.764
I just need a drink.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.766
[sighs]
Tom: Did someone say drink?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.068
Here we go.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.105
Rebecca: All right, so clearly,
Tom has seen me naked.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.573
Who else?
Judy: I have.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.409
And you look great.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.910
Very symmetrical.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.878
And super brave down there.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.680
Rebecca: What can I say?
I'm a patriot.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.815
Judy:
Hmm.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.583
Tedward: Okay, well, I for one
have not seen the photo,

05:49.617 --> 05:52.453
out of respect for
our professional relationship.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.687
Plus, I've pretty much
seen everything already

05:53.721 --> 05:55.723
since you refuse to warn me
when you change your clothes.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.426
But, you know,
mostly out of respect.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.627
Rebecca:
Thank you, Tedward.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.861
I just can't believe
this is happening.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.862
You know what?
I hope that little punk

06:01.895 --> 06:04.598
forgets his safe word
with his prison daddy.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.433
Gary: You know what?

06:05.466 --> 06:06.567
Anger is
a totally healthy reaction.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.602
Rebecca: Okay, enough with
the head shrinking, Gary.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.837
This is all your fault.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.106
If you weren't so damn cute
and such a hellcat in the sack,

06:13.140 --> 06:14.174
I wouldn't be here.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.943
Gary:
Um, I'm sorry.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.511
Rebecca:
God, I just--you know,

06:17.545 --> 06:18.912
it's not that the embarrassment
that gets me.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.715
It's the invasion of privacy.
I'm a grown woman.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.916
All right,
it's just a naked body, right?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.652
It's no big deal.
It's not like...

06:24.685 --> 06:27.621
You guys, you're not really
weirded out by this, right?

06:27.655 --> 06:29.156
all: No.
Tedward: Definitely not.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.459
Tom: [laughs nervously]
Who's gonna be weirded out?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.494
No one's--weird.
It's not.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.562
I gotta call my wife.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.130
Rebecca: He has never seen
a woman naked, has he?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.265
both: Mm-mm.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.033
Rebecca: Anyway, Tedward,
I guess you better update

06:40.067 --> 06:41.168
all the security settings
in my phone.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.836
Tedward: Yeah,
just send me a list

06:42.870 --> 06:44.137
of all of your passwords, okay?

06:44.171 --> 06:47.741
Rebecca:
Oh, all of my passwords are...

06:47.775 --> 06:49.610
"password."

06:49.643 --> 06:50.744
Heh?
Tedward: Oh, that's--yeah.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.879
Gary: Wow,
that's very smart of you.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.680
Tedward: That is clever.
I don't know how

06:52.713 --> 06:54.848
you thought of it.
Rebecca: Yeah.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.916
Gary: Tom?
Hello?

06:55.949 --> 06:56.917
You in here?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.453
I got your message.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.888
Tom: Oh, hey.
Gary, yeah, there you are.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.857
I was just looking
at this file.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.793
Gary: Tom, did you--did you
sleep here?

07:05.826 --> 07:08.896
Tom: What? No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.897
Yes.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.231
Yes, I did.
I...

07:11.264 --> 07:13.467
I told Tippi
that I saw Rebecca naked,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.903
and she flew off the handle.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.906
I haven't heard her swear like
that since our wedding night.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.907
Gary: Yeah.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.008
Yeah, hey, hey.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.811
Tom, you guys are obviously
having problems, right?

07:23.844 --> 07:24.945
How about giving
counseling a try?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
Tom: Okay.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.016
All right, what time should
I drop her off at your office?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.484
Gary: No, Tom,
you both need to be there.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.318
Tom: Right.
Gary: Yeah.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.753
Tom: Right,
in case she goes crazy

07:32.786 --> 07:34.555
and I need to subdue her.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.123
You're smart to be cautious.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.158
Gary:
And maybe take a shower.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.193
Tom: Oh, yeah.
I'll make sure she showers.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.564
Tedward: Okay, Rebecca,
I got your phone

07:43.597 --> 07:45.799
completely protected
from hackers now.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.669
You got a firewall,
a fingerprint scan,

07:48.702 --> 07:49.870
oh, and I deleted
your browser history

07:49.903 --> 07:51.705
because girl, damn.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.706
Rebecca: What?
A lot of people

07:52.740 --> 07:53.941
have humans as pets.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.743
Hernandez: Morning.
Rebecca: Sir.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.578
What case are you trying
this morning?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.712
Hernandez:
Yours.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.713
Rebecca: Hmm?
Hernandez: I'm sorry.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.849
But I have been asked
to replace you, Rebecca.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.784
Rebecca: What?
By whom?

08:03.817 --> 08:04.752
Hernandez:
The Judicial Review Board.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.887
They feel that
this is too important a case

08:06.920 --> 08:08.622
to be handled by someone
who's dealing with

08:08.656 --> 08:09.723
this kind of distraction.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.792
Rebecca: That's ridiculous.
I gotta talk to them.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.260
Hernandez: You will have
your chance tomorrow.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.062
You are to go before the Board

08:15.095 --> 08:16.930
so they can decide if
they're going to sanction you.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.599
Rebecca: Oh, so they're gonna
kick me off the bench

08:18.632 --> 08:21.001
because I took a selfie,
a private photo,

08:21.034 --> 08:23.103
that someone else hacked into
and distributed to the public?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.806
Hernandez:
Well, that's one possibility.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.074
Or a suspension of some kind.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.610
In the meantime,
they say they are exercising

08:29.643 --> 08:30.878
an abundance of caution.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.045
Rebecca: Well,
that's an abundance of crap.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.213
Tedward: Yeah, she's done
a lot worse stuff than this.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.983
I mean, this is like Capone
going down for tax fraud.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.685
Rebecca: Yeah.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.119
True, but just ill-timed.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.287
Tedward: Okay.
Yeah, I get it.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.822
Hernandez:
Well, until they rule,

08:41.855 --> 08:44.758
you will be presiding
over lower-profile cases.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.627
both: How low?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.562
Roger: Your Honor,
a squirrel came in my house

08:48.596 --> 08:49.763
and bit me on my arm,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.298
and it's all
my neighbor's fault.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.866
Cullen: They have minds
of their own.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.301
They are sentient beings.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.302
Roger:
They're tree rats.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.336
Cullen:
You shut your mouth.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.906
Rebecca:
I'm gonna die here.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.975
I'm gonna die here,
and no one will know.

09:08.081 --> 09:08.281
.

09:08.315 --> 09:08.816
Rebecca:
All right, so...

09:09.983 --> 09:12.753
Roger, you're saying a wild
animal came into your house

09:12.786 --> 09:14.755
and bit you on the arm,
and you want your neighbor

09:14.788 --> 09:17.658
to pay for medical expenses
and mental anguish.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.693
That's what we're talking
about here, right?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.261
That's why we're all here?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.596
[chuckles in disbelief]
Right?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.865
So what's the story here?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.199
Roger: Your Honor,

09:26.233 --> 09:29.169
the squirrel that attacked me
is that man's pet.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.303
Cullen: Not true.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.340
I leave food for him sometimes
outside, but that's it.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.207
Roger:
It's more than that.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.009
I've seen the way
you act with him.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.044
Cullen:
It's a living creature.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.612
I'm showing it kindness.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.280
Perhaps you should
try that sometime, Roger.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.082
Rebecca: All right,
don't talk to each other.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.316
Talk to me, okay?
Or better yet,

09:43.350 --> 09:44.384
don't talk at all,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.119
and we'll throw
the whole case out.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.120
It's ridiculous, right?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.789
What am I missing here?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.224
Roger: That squirrel attacked me
in my home

09:51.258 --> 09:53.126
because it has
no fear of humans,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.663
because it is Mr. Cullen's pet.

09:55.696 --> 09:59.667
I found this receipt outside
his trash can on the street

09:59.700 --> 10:03.637
for 40 pounds
of mixed nuts.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.305
Cullen: I have
a lot of cocktail parties.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.374
Roger: Oh.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.043
Your Honor,
if it please the court,

10:10.077 --> 10:13.313
the post office delivered
this tiny Santa suit

10:13.346 --> 10:15.215
to my house by mistake.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.286
It had Mr. Cullen's name
on the invoice.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.954
Tedward: Look, this--
let's just be honest,

10:20.988 --> 10:22.723
this is super cute.
Judge, look at that.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.992
Rebecca: Mr. Cullen,
how do you explain this?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.661
Cullen: That is for
one of my large collection

10:27.695 --> 10:28.862
of vintage dolls.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.031
I like to keep them
seasonally festive.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.833
Roger:
He calls that squirrel Paco.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.169
Cullen: It's not a crime
to name a squirrel!

10:36.203 --> 10:39.406
Rebecca:
All right, so...

10:39.439 --> 10:42.109
Yeah.
It's getting late, right?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.711
Why don't we pick this up
tomorrow?

10:43.744 --> 10:44.712
Okay?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.346
Tedward:
Judge, it's 9:15.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.248
Rebecca: Really?
Tedward: Yeah.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.683
Rebecca: It feels so much later
in my soul.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.884
Tedward: Mm-hmm.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.022
Gary: All right, Tippi,
why don't you tell me

10:55.055 --> 10:56.156
what's going on at home?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.424
Tippi:
Well, I've always understood

10:57.457 --> 10:59.326
that Tom has
a very high-pressure job

10:59.359 --> 11:01.361
putting away criminals.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.930
He's basically Batman.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.397
Tom: Batman with
the full legal authority

11:04.431 --> 11:06.700
of the state of California.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.901
Tippi:
It's just that lately,

11:07.935 --> 11:09.803
he's been staying later
and later at work

11:09.837 --> 11:12.405
and then locking himself away
on the weekends.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.941
So I got suspicious.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.709
Gary: You were worried
there was another woman?

11:15.743 --> 11:16.977
Tippi:
I'm not blind.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.145
Look at him.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.412
He's like something
out of a magazine.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.381
Gary:
Which magazine, exactly?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.416
Tom:
I was a child model, Gary.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.253
I was on the cover of
the Husky Boy Denim catalog

11:26.286 --> 11:27.254
three times.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.290
Tippi: And then,
he comes home late last night

11:30.323 --> 11:33.827
and just mentions
that he's seen Rebecca naked.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.262
I mean, I'm sitting at home

11:35.295 --> 11:36.496
wondering what he's doing,

11:36.529 --> 11:38.398
and he's basically
looking at judge porn.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.101
Gary: Okay, Tom,
let me ask you a question.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.303
How much do you tell Tippi
about what goes on at work?

11:43.336 --> 11:45.438
Tom: Almost nothing.
It's totally separate.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.974
See, when I walk
through that door,

11:47.007 --> 11:49.442
the cap comes off,
and I'm Bruce Wayne.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.112
Gary: Okay, well, keeping
your partner in the dark about

11:52.145 --> 11:53.246
such a big part
of your life

11:53.280 --> 11:55.515
is bound to make them
feel alienated.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.217
You know, it's like having
a third person

11:57.250 --> 12:00.053
in your relationship
that she doesn't know at all.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.389
Tippi: It just feels like
you have this life at work

12:02.422 --> 12:05.392
and all these secrets, and
I just want to be a part of it.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.260
Gary: Okay, okay, you know what?
That sounds reasonable.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.163
What is something Tom can do
to help you feel more included?

12:10.197 --> 12:11.765
Tippi:
I want to see the picture.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.133
Tom: What?
No.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.835
What, the--
the picture?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.770
Look, all right,
it's not on the website anymore,

12:16.804 --> 12:18.171
so we can't--
I certainly don't have a copy.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.908
Tippi: I want to see
what you saw.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.309
I want to see her naked.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.277
Tom: Honey, no.
It's not even worth it.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.378
Her body's not that great.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.914
She's not very attractive.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.281
Gary:
Uh, wait a minute.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.883
Just, you know, objectively,

12:29.917 --> 12:30.918
she's a smoke show.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.219
Tom:
Yeah, don't listen to him.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.286
He's sleeping with her.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.855
Tippi:
You're sleeping with her?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.891
Who doesn't she have
under her spell?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.129
Rebecca: Sir, I cannot take
another day

12:42.162 --> 12:43.130
of small claims court, okay?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.098
The people in there are petty,
they smell bad,

12:45.132 --> 12:46.433
and they haven't done
anything wrong.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.936
I need hardened criminals.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.939
Man, what I wouldn't give
for an arsonist

12:51.972 --> 12:53.941
or a serial killer.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.375
Oh, sir, sir,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.544
what do I have to do
to put this behind me

12:57.577 --> 12:59.246
and get back
into my court?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.881
Hernandez:
You could be proactive.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.416
You could take steps
to show the board

13:03.450 --> 13:05.218
that you are rectifying
your behavior.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.387
Rebecca: My behavior?
I took a picture.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.556
Hernandez:
It's all about appearances.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.291
When Judge O'Keefe
got that DUI,

13:11.324 --> 13:12.559
he went to an AA meeting.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.295
When Judge Brandon got caught
doing cocaine with that bailiff,

13:15.328 --> 13:16.163
he went into treatment.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.231
Rebecca: Yeah, we've had
a bad run, huh?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.370
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.272
Is this the group sex thing?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.506
That came out wrong.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.343
I mean the group for people
who like to have sex too much?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.345
Randy:
You're in the right place.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.446
And you can be helped.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.115
Rebecca: Cool.
Randy: What's your name?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.583
Rebecca: I'm Rebecca.

13:36.616 --> 13:41.354
all: Hi, Rebecca.
Rebecca: Oh, wow, hi, group.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.322
Thank you.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.858
I should start off by saying
I'm just here

13:44.892 --> 13:46.526
'cause I sent
a naked picture of myself

13:46.559 --> 13:48.095
to this dude
I'm seeing, so...

13:48.128 --> 13:48.929
Chad: Were you on a horse?

13:48.962 --> 13:51.598
Randy: Chad,
we talked about this.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.567
Rebecca, I think that you are
exactly where you need to be,

13:54.601 --> 13:58.305
and I'd like to talk about
how that's an interesting outfit

13:58.338 --> 14:00.140
to wear to a meeting
about sexuality.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.875
Rebecca: What?
Oh, sorry.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.610
This is--this is
just the way I dress.

14:03.643 --> 14:07.114
Randy: Let's explore that.
Why is this just how you dress?

14:07.147 --> 14:09.482
Rebecca: Um, because I like it.
Randy: No.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.151
Rebecca: No.
Randy: No.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.453
Who can help her?
Ethan?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.055
Ethan: You do it
because men demand

14:15.088 --> 14:17.257
that women sexualize
themselves,

14:17.290 --> 14:18.992
and then
we shame you for it.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.160
I'm so sorry.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.294
Randy: Thank you, Ethan.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.164
I know it's not easy to admit
that you have a problem,

14:24.197 --> 14:25.966
but if something's not hard,
it's not worth doing.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.067
Rebecca:
That's what she said.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.068
What?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.003
[laughing]
Snap.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.505
Inappropriate
for this meeting.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.976
Randy: Humor is a mask.
Let us see Rebecca.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.310
Rebecca: Well, that's what
got me here

14:37.344 --> 14:38.445
in the first place, right?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.380
That's just--
again, inappropriate.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.383
Randy: Who would like to partner
with Rebecca in an exercise?

14:43.416 --> 14:46.987
Ethan, come on.
Come on, stand up.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.289
This exercise
is gonna help us practice

14:49.322 --> 14:51.524
being nonsexual
in everyday situations.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.261
Let's pretend
we're in a grocery store,

14:54.294 --> 14:57.130
and today's special is valuing
each other as human beings.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.000
Ready?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.202
Rebecca: Okay.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.672
Ethan, would you like
some milk?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.040
Ethan: I want to have sex
with you.

15:07.074 --> 15:07.907
Sorry.
Randy: Okay, Ethan.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
That is so much better
than last week.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.011
Rebecca:
What happened last week?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.479
Chad: It was not okay.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.248
Rebecca: Oh, man.
Hey, hey, Ethan--

15:15.282 --> 15:16.549
Randy: Uh, uh...
Rebecca: Sorry.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.985
[Randy laughs]

15:18.018 --> 15:19.552
Rebecca: Let's do a do-over.
You can do this.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.054
Come on, dig deep,
all right?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.290
We're just gonna go
to a different section

15:23.323 --> 15:24.724
of the grocery store,
all right?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.726
We're in produce, okay?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.395
Gosh, I can't wait
for the Hendersons

15:28.428 --> 15:29.529
to come to dinner.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.033
Ooh, brussel sprouts.
Ethan: I want to be inside you.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.134
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Rebecca: What?

15:34.167 --> 15:37.037
Randy: Stay with it, Ethan.
You are doing so great.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.405
Rebecca:
Is he really, though?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.240
I mean, he's asked me
to have sex with him twice,

15:40.273 --> 15:41.408
and I'm gonna tell you
right now,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.343
if he asks again,
I'm gonna do it.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.246
Ethan: I can't do this!
Randy: Ethan--

15:46.279 --> 15:48.748
Ethan: I can't do this!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.050
[clapping]

15:50.083 --> 15:52.352
Randy: All right.
That's enough.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.988
Judy: Sorry I'm late.
Hey, Ethan.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.224
Randy: Judy, you know
you are not welcome here.

16:03.563 --> 16:03.963
.

16:03.997 --> 16:04.897
Rebecca: Ugh, I just feel like
such an idiot.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.134
I can't believe
I have to go back.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.668
Gary: So don't.
Rebecca: No, no.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.003
Hernandez is right.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.004
It's the only way
I'm gonna get

16:11.038 --> 16:13.406
the Judicial Review Board
to go easy on me.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.208
Come on, help me write
this stupid statement.

16:15.242 --> 16:19.046
I have to sound super sorry,
'cause I'm such a bad person.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.180
Gary: Can I do
the thing you hate?

16:20.213 --> 16:21.381
Rebecca: Now?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.116
Gary: What?
No, not that.

16:23.150 --> 16:23.916
But you hate that?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.352
We should talk
about that later.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.121
I mean, can I give you
my professional opinion?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.023
Rebecca: Oh, you mean
you want to shrink me?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.558
Gary, no, I hate
when you work outside of--

16:31.591 --> 16:34.027
You don't see me walking around
judging people in my free time.

16:34.061 --> 16:34.927
Gary: Mm.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.164
Rebecca: I walked
right into that one.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.398
Okay.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.168
Proceed.
Gary: Okay.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.104
Are you mad at yourself
for sending me that picture?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.038
Rebecca: Um, no.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.040
I mean, I was embarrassed
that it got out

16:47.074 --> 16:48.175
and all these strangers
saw it,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.143
but it was
a really good picture.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.411
Gary: It was
an outstanding picture.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.412
Rebecca: No filter.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.413
Gary: What?
Rebecca: Yeah.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.815
And I don't feel ashamed
for anything that I did.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.817
Gary: Then why are you mad
at yourself now?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.819
Rebecca: Because I hate that
I have to jump through hoops

16:59.852 --> 17:02.589
and pretend to be sorry
for something I'm not sorry for.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.625
Gary: Then why are you
apologizing?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.762
Rebecca: Doctor Boyd.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.368
You're good.
Gary: I can't help it.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.970
Rebecca:
Mm, you can't.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.676
Tedward: All rise

17:23.710 --> 17:27.514
for the honorable
Judge Rebecca Wright,

17:27.547 --> 17:30.083
presiding as we resume

17:30.117 --> 17:32.152
The Case
of the Squirrely Neighbor.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.653
Rebecca: Tedward.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.654
Tedward: You don't feel
the People's Cou vibe

17:34.687 --> 17:35.555
going on here?

17:35.588 --> 17:36.756
Rebecca: Gentlemen,
please be seated.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.757
Thank you.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.758
Now, before we begin,

17:38.791 --> 17:42.162
I wanted to apologize
to both of you gentlemen

17:42.195 --> 17:43.596
for some of the things
I said yesterday.

17:43.630 --> 17:47.367
I shouldn't have called you
a weird little man,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.870
and I shouldn't have called you
a human waste of time.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.273
Roger:
I don't believe you did.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.707
Tedward: You said that
in chambers.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.409
Rebecca: Oh.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.577
So let's cut to the chase.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.779
Mr. Cullen,
clearly Paco is your pet,

17:59.812 --> 18:01.214
and I don't have a problem
with that.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.882
I think it's--
I think it's weirdly sweet.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.152
Roger: No, it's just weird.
Rebecca: Roger.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.420
I'm about to rule in your favor,
so zip it, all right?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.856
The point is, it doesn't matter
what other people think

18:09.889 --> 18:11.891
about your relationships
or how you live your life,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.127
but you do need
to take responsibility.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.163
Now, I'm only going
to make you pay medical expenses

18:16.196 --> 18:19.132
so long as you acknowledge
your relationship with Paco

18:19.166 --> 18:21.901
and promise to be
a responsible pet owner.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.204
Can you do that?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.475
Cullen: Yes, your Honor.
Rebecca: Good.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.743
Cullen: Paco's my little buddy
who sleeps in a shoebox

18:30.777 --> 18:32.078
filled with newspaper
next to my bed,

18:32.111 --> 18:34.247
and he sits on my shoulder
and watches Dexter with me

18:34.281 --> 18:35.782
on Netflix.

18:35.815 --> 18:36.916
Rebecca: Good for you.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.518
And believe it or not,
I understand

18:38.551 --> 18:39.852
a little of what
you're going through.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.190
Cullen: I saw the picture.
Roger: So did I.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.691
Rebecca: You did?

18:44.724 --> 18:45.925
Yeah, well,
sometimes you do things

18:45.958 --> 18:48.428
that you think
are nobody else's business,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.897
and then they blow up
in your face, so...

18:50.930 --> 18:52.165
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Board,

18:52.199 --> 18:55.935
they publish calendars
of firemen,

18:55.968 --> 18:59.939
sexy, scantily clad,
in weird positions,

18:59.972 --> 19:03.476
oftentimes oiled
public servants,

19:03.510 --> 19:05.812
and you think
that because a fireman is sexy

19:05.845 --> 19:06.879
that he can't do his job?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.648
No?
Me neither.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.882
Judge: Judge Wright,
you must admit

19:09.916 --> 19:11.851
that you showed a lapse
in judgment.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.920
Rebecca: No, sir,
with all due respect,

19:13.953 --> 19:15.488
the only lapse in judgment
I showed

19:15.522 --> 19:17.924
was forgetting the fact
that anyone in the 21st century

19:17.957 --> 19:21.861
can hack into anyone else's
personal items.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.463
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Board,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.465
if you want to go ahead
and punish me or censor me,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.201
I will take my lumps,
but I will not agree with you,

19:28.235 --> 19:29.536
and I refuse to apologize.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.903
In fact,
assuming that all of you

19:30.937 --> 19:33.773
have seen me naked
without my permission,

19:33.806 --> 19:36.709
I feel that I am the one
owed an apology.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.911
Board: [muttering]

19:38.945 --> 19:41.948
Rebecca: So whenever you're
ready...

19:41.981 --> 19:43.716
No?

19:43.750 --> 19:46.319
Very good.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.587
You know, not for nothing.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.956
I think
that any woman over 40

19:49.989 --> 19:51.891
who can pull off
a nude selfie

19:51.924 --> 19:56.963
should get a parade
and a key to the city.

19:56.996 --> 19:57.897
Gary: Where is she?

19:57.930 --> 19:59.666
I mean, the hearing was over
an hour ago.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.933
What are the odds she said
or did something

20:00.967 --> 20:01.768
in front of the Board

20:01.801 --> 20:03.603
that got her
in even worse trouble?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.305
Tedward: Let's see,
I'd put that right in between

20:05.338 --> 20:07.774
absolutely
and hell yeah.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.381
all: Hey.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.982
Gary: How was it?
Was it bad?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.917
It was bad, wasn't it?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.986
Rebecca: It was a disaster.
Gary: Really?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.622
Rebecca: No.
They let me off with a warning.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.857
Psyche, psyche, psyche.
I got all of you guys.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.893
You should see your faces.
Hey.

20:26.926 --> 20:27.960
[laughs]

20:27.994 --> 20:29.629
Tedward: So wait,
we're back in the big leagues?

20:29.662 --> 20:30.963
Rebecca: Yes, we are back
in the big leagues.

20:30.997 --> 20:31.964
No more squirrel court.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.866
I feel great.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.268
Gary: Hey, Tom.
Hey, Tippi.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.736
Nice to see you guys
out together.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.938
Tom: Yeah, I've decided
that I should include Tippi

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
in my work life more,

20:40.340 --> 20:42.041
which is an independent idea
I had.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.712
It was not given to me
by anyone else.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.281
Tippi, work people.
Gary: Hey.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.382
Rebecca: Hey, Tippi.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.017
We've met before.
I'm Rebecca.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.720
Tippi:
Yes, I remember you.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.288
Tom: Almost all,
which brings me to--

20:55.322 --> 20:58.358
I have a question for you.
Rebecca: Sure.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.627
Who put the icicle
in your wife's butt?

21:00.660 --> 21:04.431
Tom: I have a really huge favor
to ask of you.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.501
Rebecca:
Let's get this over with.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.445
Can I--
Tippi: Hang on.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.351
Now I'm good.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.354
[upbeat music]

21:27.387 --> 21:30.957
