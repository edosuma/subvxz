WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.636
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion... Meet
my new trainee. Tim Armstrong.

00:04.638 --> 00:05.738
Hello.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.272
There's nothing
more stunning

00:07.274 --> 00:10.676
than seeing perfection
with a slight imperfection.

00:10.678 --> 00:14.380
So I wanted to ask if y-you,
uh, would like to go to the

00:14.382 --> 00:17.016
Lake Tahoe Jazz and
Heritage Festival.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.717
Oh, I...
(phone buzzing)

00:20.187 --> 00:22.021
With-with Tim.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.456
Yeah, I'll...

00:24.458 --> 00:27.126
I'll ask Tim to go, if he wants.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.795
Check this out, Sly.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.130
Is this perfect or what?

00:35.169 --> 00:37.803
(engine starts)

00:48.149 --> 00:49.648
Morning, Doc.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.650
Water?

00:51.652 --> 00:54.119
You've been out for a while.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.421
Suit yourself.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.223
I'd keep my strength up
if I were you, but...

00:58.225 --> 00:59.558
Gonna be a very big day.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.696
(jazz playing)

01:06.734 --> 01:09.068
My uncle used to play this
for me when I was a kid.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.536
Taught me guitar to this music.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.571
Albert Ayler,
Cannonball Adderley,

01:12.573 --> 01:15.641
Max Roach-- I mean,
sound track of my youth.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.443
I thought I had
a rough childhood.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.278
You don't like jazz?
No.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.613
I don't<i> like</i> touching
shopping cart handles.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.383
I<i> hate</i> free-form jazz.
I prefer verse,

01:24.385 --> 01:28.220
chorus, middle eight.
A nice pattern. Not chaos.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.788
That is what makes it great,
though. You have to listen

01:29.790 --> 01:31.624
for the notes
they're not playing.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.459
I wish all the notes were
the notes they're not playing.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.394
Cabe, isn't there a no-music
policy in the garage?

01:35.396 --> 01:39.131
Better not be. I just got
the Conway Twitty box set.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.299
What's a Conway Twitty?

01:40.301 --> 01:41.300
(phone rings)

01:41.302 --> 01:44.169
Saved by the bell, kid.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.771
Oh, it's a record.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.307
I thought the ferret got stuck
behind the water bottle again.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.842
Walter, I wanted to
say thank you again

01:49.844 --> 01:51.777
for the festival tickets.
Mm-hmm.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.580
Love the music, never been to Tahoe.
Paige and I are really excited.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.882
Yes. Thank you,
that was very generous.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.217
<i> Alb√≥ndigas.</i>

02:02.890 --> 02:05.657
Uh, boss? Why did you blurt out
the name for a Mexican meatball?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.726
I don't know. Maybe I'm hungry.
Well, maybe it's because

02:07.728 --> 02:09.695
the idea of Tim and Paige
going off together

02:09.697 --> 02:11.697
for an entire weekend
is too upsetting for words?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.832
So you just said... any word?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.902
If I want an analysis,
I will ask Dr. Curtis.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.804
Actually, come to think of it,
where is Toby?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.906
I didn't see my car
in the parking lot.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.808
Oh, the company car? About
that-- I missed the vote

02:22.810 --> 02:25.377
when my car
became the company car.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.779
Well, it was a landslide. Your vote
wouldn't have mattered. HAPPY: Hey!

02:27.781 --> 02:29.181
Is that hat-wearing
dipstick here?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.516
Hey, why are you so hot?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.518
'Cause he didn't answer
my phone calls last night,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.420
he blew off our breakfast, and
he won't respond to my texts.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.622
That's strange.
Is it?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.724
Or is it the typical garbage
he used to pull

02:38.726 --> 02:40.759
when he was
on a gambling bender?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.661
Happy, I know Toby, and if...

02:43.898 --> 02:45.664
Actually, he might be gambling.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.431
Do you think something might be wrong?
SYLVESTER: Wrong?

02:47.434 --> 02:49.835
Like what?
Appreciate the heads up.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.938
Okay, team, most likely nothing,
but I'm passing along the info.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.907
Was just informed
that Mark Collins

02:54.909 --> 02:56.875
has escaped his
mental health hospital.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.877
What?
Was this confirmed?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.779
100%.
He cheeked his sedative,

03:00.781 --> 03:02.848
ground it up,
dropped it in a guard's coffee,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.517
stole his walkie,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.185
exited out a side door
during the rec hour.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.187
Remember, this is a hospital,
not a prison.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.572
Toby's testimony
sent that nutbar

03:09.573 --> 03:10.956
back to the cuckoo factory
just yesterday,

03:10.958 --> 03:12.858
then he breaks out
and now Toby's missing.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.793
The odds of coincidence
are infinitesimal.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.395
Look, you're all
clearly concerned.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.729
Let's just
track his cell phone.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.631
After Toby put tracking software
on Happy's phone,

03:19.633 --> 03:20.899
these guys
blocked the GPS

03:20.901 --> 03:22.634
on their cars and cells.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.904
I... actually
have a general idea

03:25.906 --> 03:28.373
of the direction Toby was heading.
How do you know that?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.210
He just mentioned that he was
heading downtown. You're lying.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.744
What?
Okay, what else do you know?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.680
He just told me that he was
heading downtown

03:34.682 --> 03:35.948
and I know he hates
freeway traffic,

03:35.950 --> 03:37.649
so I'm sure that
he was taking Olympic.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.885
Okay, so we hack into

03:39.887 --> 03:42.654
the city's traffic cams

03:42.656 --> 03:44.456
and look at the intersections
that he might have been

03:44.458 --> 03:45.824
at the time he was driving.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.892
Around 6:30.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.560
Okay, you know something

03:48.562 --> 03:49.995
that you're not telling me.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.430
You're scaring me.
Good.

03:51.432 --> 03:55.234
Here it is.
Okay, here's my car

03:55.236 --> 03:57.669
at Olympic and Olive,
then Olympic and Midway,

03:57.671 --> 04:00.305
and then... it's gone.

04:00.307 --> 04:03.642
So he stopped somewhere on
Olympic between Midway and Hill.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.377
Let's check it out.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.979
What do you got there,
some kind of science project?

04:06.981 --> 04:09.781
You're not gonna joke your way
out of this one, Tobias.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.983
No, today

04:10.985 --> 04:12.818
is a very serious day.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.287
It's a<i> die magno.</i>

04:15.289 --> 04:16.555
That's Latin.

04:16.557 --> 04:20.492
I like talking
in dead languages

04:20.494 --> 04:23.528
to remind humanity that
we are as ephemeral

04:23.530 --> 04:26.665
as the words that
leave our lips.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.034
Glad to see the psych ward
worked out for you.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.836
You can mock me all you want,

04:30.838 --> 04:34.640
but when my work is done...

04:34.642 --> 04:38.477
nobody will be laughing.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.879
What work is that?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.315
Conversing to humanize yourself.
That's cute.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.852
When you're committed, Toby,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.020
when your freedom

04:48.022 --> 04:51.390
and your dignity
are ripped from you,

04:51.392 --> 04:53.592
all you have left is time.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.327
Now, I spent my time

04:55.329 --> 04:57.796
on research for BBI:

04:57.798 --> 04:59.798
brain-to-brain interface.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.034
Now, I was limited, of course,
by what I could accomplish

05:02.036 --> 05:04.536
in a padded room,
but one day,

05:04.538 --> 05:07.973
reading a newspaper,
I saw an obituary.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.043
Megan O'Brien Dodd.

05:11.045 --> 05:14.379
Never took Sylvester
as the marrying type.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.549
"Mrs. Dodd is survived
by a brother

05:17.551 --> 05:20.585
who fought valiantly
to save her life."

05:20.587 --> 05:24.089
That sentimental drivel
made me realize that Walter

05:24.091 --> 05:27.526
must have tried
some kind of brain save.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.795
So that's what I want.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.997
I want his neurological research
to complete my own.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.532
Collins,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.334
Walter isn't gonna
give you anything.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.536
Oh, except that he will.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.372
I'm going to motivate
him to do so.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.542
Toby's hat is in
the passenger seat.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.011
He never goes anywhere
without that stupid hat.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.080
Forget about the hat.
Who goes anywhere

05:48.082 --> 05:49.681
without their cell phone
and keys?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.083
WALTER:
It's cracked.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.051
What was he
even doing here?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.787
Hold on. He was sending
a text to Sly.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.122
"Check this out, Sly.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.057
Is this perfect or what?"
What does that mean?

05:59.059 --> 06:00.792
I'm not sure.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.394
You're lying again.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.763
Sly?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.698
Kid, if you know
something, share it.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.734
I swear to you, i-if I
knew anything relevant

06:08.736 --> 06:11.536
to where Toby is,
I-I would share it.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.105
(phone rings)

06:13.107 --> 06:15.440
(high-pitched tone)

06:15.442 --> 06:17.542
Hello?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.643
Hello, old friend.
You looking for someone?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.649
Collins, I promise this will
not turn out well for you.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.884
Maybe,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.919
maybe not.
But I promise you

06:27.921 --> 06:30.155
it definitely will not
turn out well for Toby

06:30.157 --> 06:32.391
unless you give me what I want,

06:32.393 --> 06:35.627
namely all the research
you did for Megan.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.897
Why the hell does he want that? Do I
hear the fed who helped send me away?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.065
He'd better be the only cop

06:40.067 --> 06:41.700
on this thing,
otherwise Scorpy's

06:41.702 --> 06:43.101
gonna have a seat to fill.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.571
Understood. Now, why do
you want my work? Because

06:46.573 --> 06:48.774
I'm gonna finally complete
all the BBI research

06:48.776 --> 06:50.809
that I started
over a decade ago.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.911
Now, to set the scene,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.947
we've got the doc strapped
to a metal chair,

06:55.949 --> 06:59.584
which is hooked into a live
battery from a stolen car.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.620
If you don't send your work
to the untraceable

07:01.622 --> 07:03.488
e-mail account
I just forwarded you

07:03.490 --> 07:04.656
in the next half hour,

07:04.658 --> 07:06.992
Toby is toast. Now,
the way I see this:

07:06.994 --> 07:10.195
whether he gets hurt or not
is up to you.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.997
Oh, and Walter?

07:11.999 --> 07:14.166
You should have never
kicked me off the team.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.553
He's crazier than ever.
Okay, just

07:17.554 --> 07:19.438
give him the research and end this.
You know I can't do that.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.972
Like hell you can't. Why can't
you give him what he wants?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.041
BBI-- brain-to-brain interface--
it allows people

07:23.043 --> 07:25.477
with strategically placed
skull electrodes

07:25.479 --> 07:27.779
to communicate
with each other via thoughts.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.448
It's rudimentary right now--
you can tell if someone's

07:29.450 --> 07:30.982
thinking left, right,
yes or no by picking up

07:30.984 --> 07:32.651
on their brain's unique
electrical signals.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.187
But a mind like Collins' can
advance that science to where

07:35.189 --> 07:37.722
a sensitive enough
neurological implant can read

07:37.724 --> 07:39.758
the electrical impulses
of someone close to it,

07:39.760 --> 07:43.061
even if that person doesn't
have any electrodes on them.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.763
Mind reading? If
Collins combines

07:44.765 --> 07:47.566
his research with mine, then can
you imagine the privacy issues,

07:47.568 --> 07:49.901
the security concerns,
if he has that tech?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.470
Or if he sells it
to someone else.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.738
Or just puts it online
for free because he's crazy.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.207
Okay, you guys are wasting time.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.241
You're gonna let Toby
get tortured?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.860
WALTER:
No, no, we problem-solve

07:57.861 --> 07:59.478
by breaking down
what we already know.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.546
Okay, so...

08:01.548 --> 08:03.982
All right, we all heard
that his call was distorted.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.852
I bet he used a patch
to make those cell calls

08:06.854 --> 08:09.087
through a ham radio. It's nearly
impossible to track those down.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.990
Okay, so Sly and I go back
to the garage with Cabe,

08:11.992 --> 08:15.827
who calls the FCC to get specs
on radio transmission in SoCal.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.729
But how do you know
he stayed local?

08:17.731 --> 08:20.832
He's a fugitive most likely in a
stolen car with a kidnap victim

08:20.834 --> 08:22.901
in the back. He wouldn't
want to get pulled over

08:22.903 --> 08:24.102
so he wouldn't drive far.
Okay,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.937
Paige-- you,
Happy and Tim

08:25.939 --> 08:27.839
go to the hospital
Collins escaped from.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.008
The one place where we know he isn't.
Toby would be

08:30.010 --> 08:31.460
the first person to say, if you

08:31.461 --> 08:32.911
want to learn a plan,
you learn the man.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.579
Right? We need to
see where Collins

08:34.581 --> 08:36.214
spent the last
two years scheming.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.950
MAN:<i> I assure you, we already</i>

08:38.952 --> 08:40.552
searched every inch of his room.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.187
We like to be thorough.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.822
We're looking for any writing
Collins may have done,

08:43.824 --> 08:45.524
anything where he
laid out his plan.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.958
Writing implements
aren't allowed in the rooms.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.860
They can be fashioned
into weapons.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.829
Yeah, well, the last time
we were with Collins

08:50.831 --> 08:52.197
we found his collection
of notebooks.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.299
Collins is visual,
writes down everything

08:54.301 --> 08:56.234
so that he can see it.
That's how he planned the escape

08:56.236 --> 08:57.869
and the kidnapping. Not
in here, he didn't.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.238
No pen, no pencils--
strict policy.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.673
Where else did Collins
get time alone?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.008
He worked in the kitchen
in the east wing.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.743
He was alone in there
for clean-up duty.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.844
I'm gonna comm up, I'm gonna
check out the mess hall.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.013
Okay, let us know what you find.
Will do.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.148
Okay, someone
recently resewed this.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.952
Hey, uh, hey,
excuse me.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.854
What the heck is that?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.590
Uh, you had your microwave
replaced recently, didn't you?

09:18.592 --> 09:19.958
Stopped working.
How'd you know?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.826
Collins tore its guts out
so that he could

09:21.828 --> 09:23.295
build a wireless signal booster.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.263
We don't allow patients
Internet access.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.831
Their use of the computer lab

09:26.833 --> 09:28.967
is strictly for games
and educational CDs.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.002
Does the admin building
across the quad

09:31.004 --> 09:32.971
have Internet access?
Well, of course.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.340
Okay, so he figured out how
to pump your signal and get on

09:35.342 --> 09:36.841
the information superhighway.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.927
We need to see
your computer lab.

09:38.928 --> 09:41.012
FCC's e-mailing you a map of
the radio towers that transmit

09:41.014 --> 09:43.014
in 50 to 300 kilohertz.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.399
Well, that's the exact range

09:44.400 --> 09:45.783
that amateur ham radio
operates on.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.886
72 in total.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.021
Okay, so now
we just have to figure out

09:50.023 --> 09:52.223
a way to narrow it down to
the one that Collins was using

09:52.225 --> 09:53.892
to communicate with us.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.360
How are we gonna do that?

09:55.362 --> 09:58.363
I already told you there's
nothing written in here at all.

09:58.365 --> 10:02.067
Collins came in, cleaned
and left. Model worker.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.339
What's this?

10:07.341 --> 10:08.907
A whisk.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.742
Yeah, but all the wire loops
are gonna except one.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.210
We're a state hospital
on a budget.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.746
These things don't just fall
off. Okay, that's peculiar.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.248
(groans) Collins wouldn't vandalize
anything in the kitchen.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.917
He was a neat freak.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.052
He'd go nuts if you
so much as put a delivery

10:21.054 --> 10:22.921
on his table over there
instead of on the counter.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.923
Wait, why wouldn't he want
anything placed on his table?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.391
He was particular.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.127
(grunting)

10:29.129 --> 10:31.997
Uh... what are
you doing?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.398
I ain't cleaning this up, man.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.106
What the hell's that?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.779
That is Collins' plan.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.914
Problem is, I can't read it.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.385
Holy smokes.
Must have used his finger,

10:53.387 --> 10:55.304
which when dragged across
stainless steel

10:55.305 --> 10:57.222
creates a temporary mark
that is soon to fade.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.423
But the oil from
his finger doesn't fade.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.724
Right. Flour stuck

10:59.726 --> 11:01.660
to the oil,
revealed the formula.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.761
Well, that's smart thinking.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.030
It was adequate.
Well, I'm seeing

11:05.032 --> 11:07.265
symbols for megahertz
and wavelength.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.834
It looks like he was trying
to calculate which of the towers

11:09.836 --> 11:13.038
operated at a frequency
that best matched his ham radio.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.039
It's probably an older model
that he swiped

11:14.041 --> 11:15.674
from his mom's basement.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.909
Okay, so if we can crack the
formula, we're one step closer

11:17.911 --> 11:21.079
to finding out where Collins
is transmitting and hiding Toby.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.447
Happy, how goes it on your end?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.816
Making progress,
but not fast enough.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.384
I am tracking his IP history.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.053
Seems to have
a thing for farms.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.821
TIM: Farms are secluded.
It's a great place

11:29.823 --> 11:31.923
to hold a kidnapping victim,
but he also could've been

11:31.925 --> 11:33.191
meeting someone
who was gonna help him.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.026
Could've been
picking something up,

11:35.027 --> 11:36.860
who knows? Only way to know
for sure is if we get to

11:36.863 --> 11:39.297
Ponder Creek Farm. How do
you know it's this one

11:39.299 --> 11:41.933
and not one of the others? Well, 'cause
he stopped searching at this site,

11:41.935 --> 11:43.802
which means he found
what he was looking for.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.170
(phone rings)

11:45.172 --> 11:47.072
Guys, it's all zeros.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.207
I'm linking in
your phones now.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.045
(high-pitched tone)
Hello.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
Don't say I didn't warn you.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.083
Collins, listen to logic.
No, you listen to the sound

11:58.085 --> 12:00.985
your friend makes
when I complete this circuit.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.987
(screaming)

12:16.903 --> 12:19.037
(screaming) Where is the
research I asked for?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.371
Collins, stop!

12:20.373 --> 12:22.140
(screaming continues)

12:22.142 --> 12:24.442
(screaming stops)

12:24.444 --> 12:26.244
Now you know I'm serious.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.848
If Toby loses this, he doesn't
go home with parting gifts

12:29.850 --> 12:33.051
of packaged rice and car wax.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.219
(beep)

12:35.122 --> 12:36.988
Is this some kind of joke?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.423
Thought you'd be impressed.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.159
You and Team Scorpion

12:41.161 --> 12:43.428
suffer full-scale
cognitive trauma

12:43.430 --> 12:46.264
and I don't have to
lay a finger on you.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.434
You're above torture. That means
there's still decency in you.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.070
(laughs)

12:52.072 --> 12:54.939
Psychological parlor tricks
are for drunk girls,

12:54.941 --> 12:57.842
not for a superior
intellect, Toby.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.078
Now let me just be clear.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.347
You will be killed today.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.415
Just not by my hand.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.887
Okay, so what's the plan?
Sly's working the formula

13:08.889 --> 13:11.489
I found. We should check out the farm?
Yes, go.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.793
We'd better hurry, or Toby's
gonna get tortured again.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.898
You know what? I don't think
he's being tortured at all.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.200
I heard that call.
He wasn't being tickled.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.469
He said this wasn't a game
and Toby wouldn't be leaving

13:24.471 --> 13:27.806
with any parting gifts like on
a game show, so who wants to bet

13:27.808 --> 13:30.241
he saw us when Sylvester
was on<i> The Price Is Right?</i>

13:30.243 --> 13:32.210
Even if he did, so what?

13:32.212 --> 13:34.029
Okay, let me start
from the beginning.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.847
Since prehistoric times,
when humans cry for help,

13:35.849 --> 13:38.049
their octaves change.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.051
So if your clanmates couldn't
hear your first scream,

13:40.053 --> 13:42.453
perhaps they'd hear you
at a different vocal pitch.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.056
Toby's yell
was consistent.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.058
Here it is.
(screaming)

13:47.060 --> 13:48.993
TV watching is a big
time killer in hospitals.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.128
Collins sees our team

13:50.130 --> 13:52.264
on the game show,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.399
records it, then removes
the memory card from the DVR...

13:54.401 --> 13:56.534
Then he comes to
the computer lab and isolates,

13:56.536 --> 13:58.753
loops and amplifies
Toby's yell of excitement

13:58.754 --> 14:00.971
to make it sound like a scream of pain.
CABE: Then he jerry-rigs

14:00.974 --> 14:02.874
the walkie-talkie he stole
and he plays it back to us.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.075
Like I'm doing right now.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.978
(screaming)
PAIGE: Hey, so, this is great--

14:06.980 --> 14:08.980
if Toby's not being tortured,
that means we have more time.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.649
Not exactly. When
facing an enemy,

14:10.650 --> 14:12.317
it's easier to strategize
when you know what they want.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.152
So, if he's faking
the torture, that means

14:14.154 --> 14:15.987
he doesn't really care
about Walter's research.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.255
Yeah, well,
if this is just a trap

14:17.257 --> 14:19.157
for all of us,
what's his endgame?

14:19.158 --> 14:21.058
No way to know. The bottom line
is he's unpredictable,

14:21.061 --> 14:23.027
he might have no intention
of letting Toby go,

14:23.029 --> 14:25.096
which makes it more urgent
that we find him.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.632
Okay, we need to keep
working the radio towers.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.167
Which just got
a whole lot easier

14:29.169 --> 14:31.135
because I just solved
his formula!

14:31.137 --> 14:32.403
What do you got?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.172
Collins found that
the most efficient frequency

14:34.174 --> 14:36.107
for his ham radio
is 10.12 megahertz.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.409
Of the 72 towers
that we narrowed down to,

14:38.411 --> 14:40.578
only 38 of them give a strong
signal out at that number.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.113
Sly, can you narrow it down?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.048
That's the problem.
Look over here.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.884
From those 38 towers,

14:45.886 --> 14:48.119
tons of data is transmitted.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.821
Too much noise,

14:49.822 --> 14:51.522
impossible to locate
a small ham radio frequency

14:51.524 --> 14:54.259
with a cell signal
patched into it.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.027
So we eliminate the noise.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.162
How the heck
are we gonna do that?

14:58.164 --> 14:59.297
Here.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.265
My keytar.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.432
If I can get

15:01.434 --> 15:03.234
all 38 towers to broadcast

15:03.236 --> 15:04.936
just a steady single note,

15:04.938 --> 15:07.238
then it will reduce
all normal data-noise so

15:07.240 --> 15:10.108
you can see low-level
ham radio frequencies.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.543
And only one of them, Collins',

15:11.544 --> 15:12.977
will be carrying
a cell signal with it.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.412
Radio tower in
Griffith Park is

15:14.414 --> 15:16.247
a conduit for all
the others in L.A.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.282
That's where
we're heading.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.385
Hang tight.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.154
We don't know what
we might be walking into here.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.290
I'm not waiting
here like a damsel.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.591
(sighs)

15:26.593 --> 15:29.394
(gunfire)

15:29.396 --> 15:31.329
Get down!
(gasps)

15:31.331 --> 15:32.664
You okay? Stay down.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.068
(gunfire)

15:37.070 --> 15:38.603
Just got to get
a bead on him.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.338
Where the hell is Happy?

15:47.380 --> 15:50.214
(grunting)

15:50.216 --> 15:52.417
Wait!
Who the hell are you?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.118
Never heard the name
Mark Collins

15:54.120 --> 15:55.520
in my life, or Robby Curtis.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.654
It's Toby Curtis.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.356
Doctor, Harvard-trained.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.325
Sorry. Can you please
tell me what's going on here?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.193
Searched the
grounds, nothing.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.329
Okay, we are the smartest
people in the world.

16:04.331 --> 16:08.266
Why is it so difficult to
locate a 168-pound wise-ass?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.201
Watch where you point that.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.970
Why were you shooting at us?

16:11.972 --> 16:14.639
Sorry. It's just rock-salt.
Had trespassers last night.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.009
What kind of trespassers? Kind
that steal my goat collars.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.511
Probably damn
high school kids.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.214
Maybe not.
Okay, show us the herd?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.390
That's some climb.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.258
You sure about this?
Yeah.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.294
I connect the keytar
to the junction box,

16:36.296 --> 16:37.595
play a repeated note,

16:37.597 --> 16:39.497
all the other 38 towers
will do the same.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.233
Now you stay here just in case
someone calls the cops on me.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.035
You got it.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.770
(goat bleating)

16:45.772 --> 16:50.041
Every one of these goats
should have a defense collar.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.744
Sodium dexaflorite
is loaded in these pouches.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.146
Kills coyotes out
for a midnight snack.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.115
They didn't steal anything else?
No.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.484
Just busted my fence, which they
could have just climbed over.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.652
Someone deliberately
removed the hinge.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.288
Well, if this is Collins,
what the hell does he want

17:04.290 --> 17:06.457
with poison packs and an old hinge?
TIM: And wires

17:06.459 --> 17:08.192
he took off a whisk
at the mental hospital.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.794
Okay, he's building something.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.662
Question is what?

17:11.664 --> 17:15.233
It's noxious stuff
if you're a bobcat.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.301
But...

17:17.303 --> 17:19.303
if you're an egotistical,

17:19.305 --> 17:22.073
annoying, compulsive shrink...

17:22.075 --> 17:25.076
you got to up the ante a touch.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.516
(hissing)

17:37.357 --> 17:39.257
What's that for?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.259
You'll see.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.294
In the polluted
Gowanus Canal of your mind,

17:43.296 --> 17:46.330
you're king,
you make the rules?

17:46.332 --> 17:48.266
All monarchies collapse, Mark.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.600
No matter how smart you are,

17:49.602 --> 17:51.335
you're nothing
without a good team.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.571
Your plan'll fail,
'cause it's six against one.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.310
You really think you
can analyze me, Toby?

17:59.312 --> 18:02.780
Do you have any idea how
easy it is to do what you do?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.116
Huh?

18:05.118 --> 18:07.318
Watch me.

18:08.655 --> 18:12.824
You just need the slightest
piece of information.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.258
Hmm.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.296
<i>The Dolphin Trainer's Daughter?</i>

18:18.298 --> 18:21.399
Some of the prose is very sharp.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.402
(gasps)

18:24.404 --> 18:26.804
Oh, my, my, my.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.340
What is this?!

18:30.577 --> 18:33.444
(laughing)

18:33.446 --> 18:37.381
Now, there is only one woman
on the planet I can think of

18:37.383 --> 18:39.817
who would go for
a hex nut setting.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.421
You're proposing to Happy.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.223
I know her

18:45.225 --> 18:47.425
longer than you.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.827
There's no way
she would say yes.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.531
She can't.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.835
What do you mean?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.571
See how easily
I just got in your head?

19:09.782 --> 19:12.850
(grunting)

19:14.454 --> 19:16.154
Progress report, Walter?

19:16.156 --> 19:17.822
(panting)

19:21.394 --> 19:24.495
I think I can see the...
the garage from here.

19:24.497 --> 19:29.267
Isn't that a joke that's,
that's told from high altitudes?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.735
Yeah, not a funny one.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.804
Okay, I'm at the top.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.306
I'm gonna plug into

19:35.308 --> 19:36.574
the junction box.
Are you ready?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.927
SYLVESTER:
I am monitoring

19:38.928 --> 19:41.279
all 38 radio towers that Collins
could be broadcasting near.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.481
Do your thing.
About to plug it in. Happy,

19:43.483 --> 19:45.616
what's your 20? I'm
headed back to the garage

19:45.618 --> 19:47.785
to help Sly process
the tower data once

19:47.787 --> 19:49.787
you play your keytar. Oh, God.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.189
You okay?
Yeah.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.924
I'm just sore from you
laying on top of me.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.559
Huh?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.627
(groaning)

19:58.231 --> 20:00.631
(thudding)

20:01.834 --> 20:04.635
Oh, man, not good.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.437
(gasps)
My keytar.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.606
Walter, this thing's destroyed!

20:08.608 --> 20:09.974
Bring the cable up!

20:09.975 --> 20:11.341
All right, I'm on my way.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.577
(phone ringing)

20:12.579 --> 20:14.312
It's Collins.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.581
If you're calling
to demand my research,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.549
I know you don't want it and

20:18.551 --> 20:19.684
I know you didn't hurt Toby.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.452
And yet the day is still young.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.720
Let's you and me meet

20:22.722 --> 20:24.455
face to face.
Oh, Walter.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.790
Such an ego.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.692
Not everything is about you.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.361
For example,
Mr. Curtis

20:30.363 --> 20:32.430
is having quite
an interesting morning.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.332
Go ahead, Doc.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.567
Tell 'em what's cooking.
Some kind of acid.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.002
Heavy duty stuff.
HAPPY: Synthesized from

20:38.004 --> 20:39.704
the poison in the goat collars.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.705
Okay, Collins,

20:40.707 --> 20:41.939
I'm coming for you!

20:41.941 --> 20:43.441
You should bring it, Quinn.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.477
Come over and watch your fianc√©
suffer and die.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.579
(tires squeal)

20:48.581 --> 20:50.014
Oh.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.351
Did I just let the cat
out of the bag? It's true.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.518
We've got the ring right here.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.387
It's ugly as a baboon's butt.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.756
You should definitely let me
know where you're registered.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.559
PAIGE:
Happy,

21:01.561 --> 21:03.894
keep cool. That certainly is
a lot to process.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.396
Sylvester?!

21:05.398 --> 21:06.909
Yes?

21:06.910 --> 21:08.421
Is this what
you've been keeping?

21:08.422 --> 21:09.933
I didn't want to say anything
unless it was absolutely germane

21:09.936 --> 21:11.602
to finding Toby,
which this really isn't,

21:11.604 --> 21:13.537
because he made me promise
to keep it a surprise.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.306
Sly, did he pick
it up last night?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.674
Yes.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.359
So he got snatched when
he was getting the ring.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.043
That doesn't make it your fault.
It kind of does.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.780
(tires squealing)

21:29.522 --> 21:31.856
(panting)

21:31.858 --> 21:35.693
(grunts)

21:35.695 --> 21:36.961
You got the cable?
Yeah.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.030
All right.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.799
Now give me your phone.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.900
What's wrong with yours?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.435
It's a makeshift solution--

21:44.437 --> 21:46.871
it won't be perfect-- but since
the keytar is kaput,

21:46.873 --> 21:51.542
we need to create a
uniform signal with music--

21:51.544 --> 21:53.811
all stations
playing one song.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.613
And I don't have any songs
in my phone.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.349
Takes up too much space.
All right, Sly, get ready.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.951
‚ô™ As I take the love you're giving...
‚ô™ Conway Twitty?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.620
I'm a fan.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.323
I even toured his
mansion-- Twitty City.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.991
‚ô™ In your mind ‚ô™

22:06.993 --> 22:09.627
‚ô™<i> Bah-bah, bah</i> ‚ô™
‚ô™ Uh-uh, uh... ‚ô™

22:09.629 --> 22:10.795
All stations are
playing the song.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.697
Sly, anything yet?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.031
All data streams
are now identical.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.866
There are a few
ham radio frequencies

22:15.868 --> 22:18.369
showing, but only one has
a cell signal riding on it.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.503
It is Collins.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.905
Okay, we're on our way back.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.441
All right.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.911
How'd it go? SYLVESTER:
The cell phone

22:26.913 --> 22:29.013
frequency is coming
from a tower east of downtown.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.381
So we got him.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.849
What we have is
a general location.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.251
It's in an industrial area,

22:33.252 --> 22:34.652
which should narrow down
the possibilities somewhat.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.954
WALTER: But there are
18 buildings in close

22:36.956 --> 22:38.806
proximity to the tower.

22:38.807 --> 22:40.657
We flood that area with cops,
Collins gets jumpy,

22:40.660 --> 22:42.493
who knows what he does
with the acid.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.527
We try to search
each individually,

22:43.529 --> 22:44.829
it'll take the rest of the day,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.664
and I don't think
that Toby has that long.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.377
TIM:
Then we eliminate

22:48.378 --> 22:50.089
possibilities.
That one's under construction.

22:50.090 --> 22:51.801
There would be a crew there
all day. Cross it off the list.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.937
Okay, that one's

22:52.939 --> 22:54.672
an active shipping center.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.574
It's full of people. It won't be that one.
TIM: Two down.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.775
16 to go.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.685
(birds squawking)

23:07.687 --> 23:09.587
I know what
you're thinking.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.056
That's a lot of dental floss.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.758
The fact is,
I'd much rather

23:13.760 --> 23:16.427
be working
with a thicker string

23:16.429 --> 23:17.995
or twine, but

23:17.997 --> 23:19.897
you know when you're robbing
a mental hospital,

23:19.899 --> 23:22.800
you just can't be that choosy.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.408
(sighing)

23:35.648 --> 23:37.481
That was your
big plan?

23:37.483 --> 23:39.683
Try to splash ammonia
up in my face?

23:40.453 --> 23:41.519
It's pathetic.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.853
Can't fault a guy for trying.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.056
Now it stinks in here.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.963
(metallic clanking)

23:54.534 --> 23:55.800
(birds squawking)

23:55.802 --> 23:57.601
You're really building
something here, Mark.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.803
Actually going through with it.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.008
(yells)

24:04.010 --> 24:07.611
Have you ever known me not
to complete a project, Toby?

24:07.613 --> 24:11.849
Can I please just
call Happy one last time?

24:11.851 --> 24:14.452
I know that you have
decency left in you.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.686
Let me have this.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.455
I would love to hear the sound

24:17.457 --> 24:18.956
of your defeated good-bye.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.559
But... one caveat--

24:21.561 --> 24:23.961
if I let you talk to them,

24:23.963 --> 24:28.732
you're gonna have to tell them
what you yourself just realized.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.068
That I won.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.071
That I beat Scorpion.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.474
That<i> I...</i>

24:36.476 --> 24:39.710
am smarter... than Walter.

24:39.712 --> 24:43.614
(phone ringing)

24:43.616 --> 24:45.649
(phone beeps on)
Mark?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.651
TOBY:
No, Walt, it's me.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.820
I'm sure you're working hard
to find me,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.555
but he has thought this through.

24:51.557 --> 24:52.890
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.492
I think

24:54.494 --> 24:55.526
there was a reason
that you called?

24:55.528 --> 24:57.528
Guys, he beat us,

24:57.530 --> 24:59.663
and he's smarter than us,
all of us.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.504
Happy...

25:06.506 --> 25:08.239
I'm sorry.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.241
I love you and I always will.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.842
You're not saying good-bye
to me, Doc.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.010
Yeah, I am.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.012
Sylvester...

25:15.014 --> 25:17.548
listen closely.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.517
(birds squawking)

25:19.519 --> 25:22.887
Are you listening to me
care-carefully?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.689
I am.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.059
Take care of Happy for me.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.662
(phone beeps off)

25:34.700 --> 25:36.734
I can't believe
that just happened.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.537
Me either. Toby just
told me where he is.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.189
Up a creek without a paddle.
WALTER: No.

25:41.190 --> 25:42.840
Sly picked up on something.
SYLVESTER: He told me to listen

25:42.842 --> 25:44.708
carefully, not to how he wanted
me to take care of Happy.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.943
Why would he want me
to take care

25:45.945 --> 25:47.645
of Happy? She
terrifies me.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.880
Just get to where he is!
See?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.782
Anyway, when he told me
to listen carefully, he paused,

25:51.784 --> 25:53.951
just long enough for me
to hear the distinct, low,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.786
hoarse call
of the California brown pelican!

25:55.788 --> 25:56.787
TIM:
And do you know

25:56.789 --> 25:57.855
what one sounds like?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.223
I'm a world-class
ornithologist,

25:59.225 --> 26:00.991
even though birds scare
the beans out of me.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.860
And right now the pelicans
are feeding off the tiny fish

26:02.862 --> 26:05.195
in the L.A. River through
the month of April.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.731
PAIGE: Well, that means he must
be in one of these four buildings

26:07.733 --> 26:08.966
near the river.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.634
Let's roll. Let's roll!
Let's go.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.777
(tires screech)

26:21.013 --> 26:22.980
It's one of these warehouses.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.884
We have guests.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.119
I thought it would take
them another half an hour,

26:29.121 --> 26:30.721
but, oh, well.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.689
I heard the pelicans clearly.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.346
It had to be

26:33.347 --> 26:35.002
through an open window.
WALTER: They all have

26:35.003 --> 26:36.658
open windows. They all potentially
have a trap waiting for us.

26:36.662 --> 26:39.129
Everyone goes in, eyes open,
ready for anything.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.332
We need to split up. Paige and I
will take this warehouse here.

26:41.334 --> 26:44.068
Okay. So, Sly and Happy
take the end.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.870
Cabe and I will split up
and cover the others.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.611
I wish you good
luck, Tobias.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.045
You're gonna need it.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.397
Hey, Collins!

27:13.399 --> 27:16.166
Collins?

27:28.648 --> 27:30.280
They're all locked!

27:30.282 --> 27:31.982
TOBY:
Guys!

27:31.984 --> 27:32.850
I'm in here!

27:32.852 --> 27:34.818
Ugh! Move! Move!

27:34.820 --> 27:36.954
It's Toby! We got Toby!

27:37.323 --> 27:39.156
Oh, man.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.159
Hey, guys. Welcome to the inside
of Collins' brain.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.728
Oh, what's happening here?
TOBY: The Mason jar

27:44.730 --> 27:47.297
is held by floss,
the acid is in the jar.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.001
Okay, the old hinge,
the whisk wires.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.670
This is what he was building.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.388
TOBY:
Don't touch anything!

27:54.389 --> 27:56.105
One of these threads
leads to the jar. You jostle it,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.275
the acid eats through my septum,
then back through my trachea.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.943
I'll suffocate in seconds.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.079
That's a problem.
It gets worse.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.981
He shaved down the floss
right over my head.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.749
It won't hold
more than a few minutes.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.751
Collins is calling us
to outthink him.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.820
And if we can't, Toby dies.

28:09.822 --> 28:13.090
Happy, Sly, I need you
to figure this one out fast!

28:24.036 --> 28:26.070
Guys, I'm running out
of time here!

28:26.072 --> 28:27.204
Okay, you're the math guy.
Figure out the pattern here.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.972
What do I look like, a dentist?!

28:28.974 --> 28:30.941
I have no clue
how to solve this!

28:30.943 --> 28:33.177
Oh, what in the name of...?

28:33.179 --> 28:34.344
Don't touch anything!
It's a booby trap!

28:34.346 --> 28:35.813
PAIGE:
Walter, we cannot crack

28:35.815 --> 28:36.980
what Collins set up.

28:36.982 --> 28:39.149
We could really use
your mind over here.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.251
Walter, answer me!

28:42.488 --> 28:44.321
(crackling)

28:44.990 --> 28:46.256
(shouting)
Collins, please! Please!

28:46.258 --> 28:47.124
(grunts)

28:47.126 --> 28:48.642
I got him!

28:48.643 --> 28:50.159
I have Collins!
Well, who cares? Get over here.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.362
Toby's in trouble. I know. I heard
about the trap over the comms.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.264
But I can't just
leave him here.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.500
Tell them how to save Toby! Now!

28:56.502 --> 28:58.202
Or what, you'll brain me?

28:58.204 --> 29:01.105
I clearly don't
care, Walter.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.873
But you do.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.875
About Tobias.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.378
And that's why you'll let me go
to go save your friend.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.780
Happy,

29:09.781 --> 29:11.181
tell Cabe to get over here
and take Collins.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.016
Then I'll run over to you.
I'm a few buildings south.

29:13.018 --> 29:13.984
There's not enough time.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.252
Get over here.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.519
Look at how weak they made you.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.223
The old Walter would have
never struggled with this.

29:19.225 --> 29:22.092
The greater good
obviously dictates

29:22.094 --> 29:24.094
that you do not let me go,

29:24.096 --> 29:26.163
because
I can do harm

29:26.165 --> 29:30.234
to many more people
than Tobias could ever help.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.368
TOBY:
Gang, did you come up

29:31.370 --> 29:33.036
with a plan yet?!
That's it.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.505
I'm cutting through.
No. No, no, no.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.774
You hit the wrong one,
he could die.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.945
Walter, do you know
why the wolf spider

29:41.947 --> 29:43.947
is a Darwinian marvel?

29:43.949 --> 29:47.084
Because
it lives alone.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.219
That is what makes it superior.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.088
It depends on nobody.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.223
Does that remind you
of somebody?

29:53.225 --> 29:56.226
Kicking me off Scorpion,
it was a deep betrayal.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.427
But it
also served me well.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.830
Uh-huh.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.066
You're not a killer.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.068
I am what you made me.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.839
And you are
what Scorpion made you.

30:08.841 --> 30:12.242
A weak and feeble man
who cares more about feelings

30:12.244 --> 30:15.312
and sentiment and friends

30:15.314 --> 30:18.982
than about a logical course
of action.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.553
Now go ahead and drop the pipe

30:22.555 --> 30:24.888
and go save your little pal.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.595
(clang)

30:31.597 --> 30:33.497
Whoa!

30:37.203 --> 30:38.902
Whoa, this is bad. Okay,
I've been running this

30:38.904 --> 30:41.171
through my head at top speed,
and I can't figure it out.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.307
Well, you don't have to.
We figure it out.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.275
Okay, Collins says
that our team makes us weak,

30:45.277 --> 30:46.610
but it's the opposite,
so we solve this together.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.262
Now, what do you know for sure?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.913
Looks like
standard dental floss.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.249
Seems like it's covered
in perfluorinated polymer,

30:52.251 --> 30:56.186
similar to what they use to coat
frying pans or guitar strings.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.856
Guitar strings.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.592
The-the floss is just
coated strings pulled tight.

31:01.594 --> 31:03.227
It's-it's like a guitar.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.712
So they'd give off a sound.

31:04.713 --> 31:06.196
But one of the strings
would sound different,

31:06.198 --> 31:07.865
the one with more force
pulling on it.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.000
Right. The one weighted down
by the Mason jar will make

31:10.002 --> 31:11.568
a sharper note. You're the jazz master.
Give one a pluck.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.204
Do<i> not</i> give one of them a pluck!
Look,

31:14.206 --> 31:15.939
I will be careful,
okay? I promise.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.574
(panting)

31:17.576 --> 31:20.010
(clears throat)

31:20.012 --> 31:20.911
(note plays)

31:20.913 --> 31:21.645
(gasps)

31:21.647 --> 31:23.313
That's a pure "B."

31:24.583 --> 31:27.184
Also a "B."

31:27.186 --> 31:28.252
Cut 'em both.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.152
Oh, my God.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.959
Nothing happened.
WALTER: Okay, guys,

31:35.961 --> 31:38.395
we got to cut every piece
of floss that's a "B" note.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.631
That one's good.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.333
(different note plays)

31:43.335 --> 31:45.269
TIM:
Don't, don't,

31:45.271 --> 31:47.037
don't, don't. I'm not sure
about that one yet.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.107
That one's good.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.376
Careful, careful,
careful.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.212
(team members murmuring)

31:55.214 --> 31:56.113
No, no, that's fine.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.681
(grunts)
Good.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.953
Let's go.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.021
Happy, listen,

32:04.023 --> 32:05.122
we both know the question

32:05.124 --> 32:06.874
I was gonna ask you today.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.625
Okay, shut up, Doc. No,
I need to say this,

32:08.627 --> 32:10.093
'cause I don't think
you're gonna get to me

32:10.095 --> 32:11.328
before the acid eats through my...
I said

32:11.330 --> 32:12.629
shut up!
I have a ring

32:12.631 --> 32:14.364
in my satchel.

32:14.366 --> 32:18.035
Okay, you will not propose to me
while you are tied up to a chair

32:18.037 --> 32:20.270
and I'm up to my elbows
in floss.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.406
Toby, we'll be to you
in 30 seconds!

32:22.408 --> 32:24.441
I don't have 30 seconds!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.209
Happy, I love you!

32:26.211 --> 32:27.177
Okay, screw this.

32:27.179 --> 32:27.711
Happy, no!
Happy!

32:27.713 --> 32:29.563
The jar!

32:29.564 --> 32:31.414
(grunting)

32:31.417 --> 32:32.316
(sighs)

32:32.318 --> 32:33.250
You okay?

32:33.252 --> 32:35.452
See? Knew you were a keeper.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.454
CABE:
Sylvester, Tim,

32:37.456 --> 32:38.455
get in there
and untie the doc.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.023
Now we got to deal with Collins.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.092
PAIGE:
Okay, call the FBI.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.027
Let 'em know he's on the loose.

32:43.028 --> 32:43.961
He's loose because of me.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.062
I let him go to come here.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.097
(grunts)
Kudos for that, by the way.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.299
There's a dangerous guy
out in the world because of me.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.101
Now, you can call
the authorities if you want,

32:51.103 --> 32:53.437
but I'm going after him.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.413
DRIVER (over P.A.):
Rosemead stop coming up.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.087
(crunching)

33:12.024 --> 33:14.091
Not getting off?

33:15.694 --> 33:18.028
Pity.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.571
CABE: Think this is your stop.

33:29.508 --> 33:33.110
Now stand up slowly so
my partner can cuff you.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.646
(grunts)

33:44.256 --> 33:46.723
Is the psychiatrist dead?

33:46.725 --> 33:50.027
(chuckles)
Nope.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.630
I don't care for him.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.769
Walter.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.771
You interrupted my journey.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.040
Mm-hmm.
So,

34:03.042 --> 34:04.508
how did you find me?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.176
When Scorpion first started,

34:06.178 --> 34:08.045
you and I spent a weekend
deciphering

34:08.047 --> 34:09.780
an obfuscated batch file.

34:09.782 --> 34:10.814
Yeah.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.215
We did
inspired work.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.817
That's right.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.086
And one night you told me
how, when you were ten,

34:16.088 --> 34:19.356
you spent a summer in
South Carolina with your uncle

34:19.358 --> 34:21.158
and how sad
you were

34:21.160 --> 34:23.093
when he got sick
and you had to come home.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.828
Because he was the only person
in your life

34:24.830 --> 34:26.830
who really accepted you
for the way that you were.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.666
How is any of this relevant?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.401
Well, I'm not like most humans,
Mark,

34:31.403 --> 34:35.205
but I have gained humanity
these past years.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.808
Now, the old Walter
would've remembered your story

34:37.810 --> 34:41.845
about the uncle but not
really understood the relevance.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.548
But now I know
why, out of all

34:44.550 --> 34:47.717
the solitary animals you
could've chosen, you picked...

34:47.719 --> 34:50.320
the wolf spider,

34:50.322 --> 34:53.824
the state arachnid
of South Carolina.

34:53.826 --> 34:57.094
It's the locale of
your fondest childhood memory.

34:57.096 --> 35:00.297
You were about to be
on the run and scared,

35:00.299 --> 35:02.099
and I knew
that you'd want to go back

35:02.101 --> 35:04.801
to the one place
that you'd ever felt safe.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.604
And I understand
that feeling, Mark.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.106
I feel the same way

35:09.108 --> 35:12.442
about my cyclone at Scorpion.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.680
They ruined you.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.187
(grunts)

35:24.189 --> 35:25.689
I have no
idea why...

35:25.691 --> 35:27.491
I packed so much
for just two nights.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.192
Overpacking
is a sign of anxiety.

35:29.194 --> 35:29.793
Really?

35:29.795 --> 35:30.794
I'll get these.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.796
(grunts)

35:32.798 --> 35:34.431
Huh. Maybe I'm...

35:34.433 --> 35:38.201
more worried about leaving Ralph
with Sly than I realize.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.175
TOBY:
Hey, Happy.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.343
Can I talk to you for a sec?

35:46.345 --> 35:47.244
No.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.716
I promise this'll be quick.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.152
No, thank you.
I promise

35:55.154 --> 35:56.686
I won't ask the question
you're expecting.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.157
Come on, he won't bite.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.491
Shut up. I barely know you.

36:13.939 --> 36:17.374
You know
I'd never lie to you.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.243
And I said I wasn't gonna ask
you a question.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.913
But I am going to sing you one.

36:22.915 --> 36:25.182
No. No, no...
Eh!

36:26.251 --> 36:28.285
‚ô™ Oh, Happy ‚ô™

36:28.287 --> 36:29.886
‚ô™ I know
it sounds sappy ‚ô™

36:29.888 --> 36:33.256
‚ô™ But I feel
so crappy ‚ô™

36:33.258 --> 36:35.325
‚ô™ When I'm not with you ‚ô™

36:35.327 --> 36:37.761
‚ô™ ‚ô™

36:37.763 --> 36:39.629
‚ô™ I know you'll save me
if I'm in a pinch ‚ô™

36:39.631 --> 36:42.899
‚ô™ Probably
with a monkey wrench ‚ô™

36:42.901 --> 36:46.269
‚ô™ I want to fulfill
your desires ‚ô™

36:46.271 --> 36:48.238
‚ô™ Like a pair
of needle-nose pliers ‚ô™

36:48.240 --> 36:49.973
‚ô™ Oh, Happy ‚ô™

36:49.975 --> 36:53.476
‚ô™ You make me
so happy ‚ô™

36:53.478 --> 36:55.645
‚ô™ I just rhymed "Happy"
with "happy" ‚ô™

36:55.647 --> 36:58.982
‚ô™ Because I love you. ‚ô™

36:58.984 --> 37:01.218
(pop)

37:01.220 --> 37:02.719
(team members exclaim)

37:02.721 --> 37:05.255
I've loved you
since I can't remember when,

37:05.257 --> 37:07.224
and I'm gonna love you
till I can't forget how.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.296
Will you please marry me?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.401
No.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.271
(pop)

37:21.273 --> 37:22.405
Why not?

37:23.375 --> 37:24.808
I can't.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.981
I'm married to someone else.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.283
I'm sorry.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.587
Happy, what...?

37:37.589 --> 37:40.724
Please don't follow me.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.330
We should go.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.401
Sorry, pal.

37:51.403 --> 37:54.404
What-what did she...
what did she mean?

37:54.406 --> 37:58.608
Two things that won't help
are self-hatred and booze.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.011
Tonight will be
full of both.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.280
But don't make either a habit.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.783
Toby...

38:06.785 --> 38:10.854
I, um, don't want
to talk to anyone right now.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.657
TIM:
Hey, um,

38:13.659 --> 38:16.493
if you still want to go,
we should probably hit the road.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.295
It's gonna be a long drive.
Yeah, yeah.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.997
Of course. Um, I'll just meet
you out by the car.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.533
Okay.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.302
(sighs)

38:30.375 --> 38:32.375
Wow.
(exhales)

38:32.377 --> 38:34.544
That was... messy.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.413
Yeah, it's a mess that I made.

38:36.415 --> 38:40.350
I should've stood by my position
on intraoffice relationships.

38:40.352 --> 38:43.353
I didn't.
And now... Happy's crying,

38:43.355 --> 38:45.388
Toby's distraught. It's gonna
ripple through the whole team.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.390
Don't blame yourself.
Relationships are messy.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.759
That's their nature.
That's exactly my point.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.762
Someone works with a woman
every day, enjoys her company,

38:52.764 --> 38:55.432
is attracted to her, thinks
of what-what she'll be doing

38:55.434 --> 38:58.101
when he sees her at work,
and what she'll be doing

38:58.103 --> 39:00.970
at night
when she goes back home.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.440
But if-if it's gonna derail

39:03.442 --> 39:05.375
the goals that we've set here
at Scorpion,

39:05.377 --> 39:06.443
then it can't be realized.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.844
You know?
Those feelings

39:07.846 --> 39:10.480
need to be buried
and left alone.

39:14.419 --> 39:17.687
You are talking about... Toby?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.422
What? Yeah.

39:19.424 --> 39:20.423
Of course.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.426
Oh.

39:23.428 --> 39:26.396
Okay. Well, uh...

39:26.398 --> 39:29.532
(sputters) I should be going.
Tim's waiting.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.001
Sure. Yeah. Guess you should.
Unless, of course, you think

39:32.003 --> 39:34.137
that, with everything going on,
I should...

39:34.139 --> 39:37.841
maybe cancel
and stay here and...

39:37.843 --> 39:40.810
help with
Toby.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.413
It's like you said...

39:43.415 --> 39:45.382
it's a mess.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.820
It's probably best you go.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.889
Okay.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.127
Well, I'll see you
in a couple days.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.396
Okay.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.932
‚ô™ Halloween is here ‚ô™

40:02.934 --> 40:06.536
‚ô™ And they left it
in this home ‚ô™

40:06.538 --> 40:08.171
‚ô™ Stitches on my body... ‚ô™

40:08.173 --> 40:09.923
(grunts)

40:09.924 --> 40:11.674
‚ô™ Closet's full of bones... ‚ô™

40:11.676 --> 40:14.411
Maybe you should slow down
with the tequila.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.413
<i> Incorrecto, muchacho.</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:18.414
My liver's making a run for the border.
Well, you know,

40:18.417 --> 40:20.750
tomorrow I'll go...
see Happy, I'll...

40:20.752 --> 40:23.186
talk to her,
smooth this all out.

40:23.188 --> 40:26.089
Would you do that for me?
Of course.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.524
You know, when she understands

40:27.526 --> 40:29.025
that this romantic experiment
was a mistake,

40:29.027 --> 40:31.561
she will focus on work and
feel better, and you'll...

40:31.563 --> 40:34.764
get back on point as well,
and Scorpion will be stabilized.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.633
Wow.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.902
You are such a jerk.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.136
Excuse me, Toby?

40:40.138 --> 40:41.838
You don't care
that this is a problem for me.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.473
Or Happy. You care
that it's a problem

40:43.475 --> 40:45.108
for your precious Scorpion.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.110
Right. If Scorpion is
in proper equilibrium,

40:47.112 --> 40:48.778
we're all in equilibrium.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.514
‚ô™ Loving nothing more ‚ô™

40:51.516 --> 40:53.149
‚ô™ Than black magic... ‚ô™

40:53.151 --> 40:55.885
What I'm about to say
is not fueled by emotion

40:55.887 --> 40:57.220
or the worm I just swallowed.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.556
It's fueled by my love for you.

40:59.558 --> 41:02.225
You, Walter, are a gigantic ass.

41:03.195 --> 41:04.661
Pardon me?

41:04.663 --> 41:07.130
You're so obsessed
with keeping this team together,

41:07.132 --> 41:10.800
to attach some meaning as
to why you are the way you are,

41:10.802 --> 41:13.536
that you're willing
to sacrifice love for it.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.804
I'm gonna
make it easy for you.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.606
You're a genetic fluke.
So freaking what?

41:16.608 --> 41:17.774
It doesn't matter!

41:17.776 --> 41:20.210
What matters
in life is love!

41:20.212 --> 41:23.546
And mine just walked out
the door! I'm dying inside!

41:23.548 --> 41:27.217
I would do anything to make her
come back here and say yes.

41:27.219 --> 41:30.220
And you, you jackass, you pushed
your love out the door

41:30.222 --> 41:31.754
to spend the weekend
with another man!

41:31.756 --> 41:35.592
A big, sexy, muscled
Navy SEAL man!

41:35.594 --> 41:37.927
<i>¬øComprende,</i> 197?

41:39.898 --> 41:43.032
‚ô™ Oh, oh, oh, oh... ‚ô™

41:43.034 --> 41:45.735
(drawers banging)

41:47.005 --> 41:48.671
Where are they?
What?

41:48.673 --> 41:50.974
My car keys, where are they?
The company car?

41:50.976 --> 41:51.841
It's my car! Where are they?!

41:51.843 --> 41:52.842
On my desk.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.511
Okay.

41:54.513 --> 41:57.146
(panting)

41:57.148 --> 41:58.848
Hold on, where you going?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.917
I'm gonna stop Paige.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.752
I-I...

42:02.754 --> 42:04.754
I love her.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.756
I'm a moron.

42:06.758 --> 42:07.891
No.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.260
You're just a genius.

42:10.262 --> 42:12.128
‚ô™ Blister on my tongue ‚ô™

42:12.130 --> 42:15.064
‚ô™ Loving nothing more ‚ô™

42:15.066 --> 42:18.902
‚ô™ Than black magic... ‚ô™

42:18.904 --> 42:20.603
Call Paige.

42:20.605 --> 42:21.604
FEMALE VOICE:
Calling Paige.

42:21.606 --> 42:22.772
(line ringing)

42:24.709 --> 42:26.776
PAIGE (recorded): Hi, this is Paige Dineen.
I can't come

42:26.778 --> 42:28.011
to the phone,
but leave a detailed message

42:28.013 --> 42:29.012
and I'll get back to you.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.547
Thanks.
(beep)

42:30.549 --> 42:32.081
‚ô™ Love is hell,
nothing more... ‚ô™

42:32.083 --> 42:33.716
Damn it.
(panting)

42:33.718 --> 42:36.019
‚ô™ Than black magic ‚ô™

42:36.021 --> 42:39.822
‚ô™ Careful what you wish for ‚ô™

42:39.824 --> 42:41.891
‚ô™ It might happen. ‚ô™
