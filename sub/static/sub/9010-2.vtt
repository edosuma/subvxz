00:06.876 --> 00:09.042
Kaz:  PREVIOUSLY

00:06.876 --> 00:09.042
ON  MIGHTY MED...

00:09.083 --> 00:10.209
THIS MUST BE

00:09.083 --> 00:10.209
SOME KIND OF, LIKE,

00:10.250 --> 00:12.000
SECRET SUPERHERO HOSPITAL.

00:12.042 --> 00:13.876
SUPERHEROES DON'T EXIST.

00:13.918 --> 00:15.292
YOU'RE SKYLAR STORM!

00:15.334 --> 00:17.417
I CAME HERE TO MIGHTY MED

00:15.334 --> 00:17.417
TO GET MY POWERS RESTORED.

00:17.459 --> 00:18.542
( electricity surges,

00:17.459 --> 00:18.542
machine beeps )

00:18.584 --> 00:19.834
MAYBE THE EXTREME GRAVITY

00:19.876 --> 00:21.876
PULLED HIS HEART FROM HIS CHEST

00:19.876 --> 00:21.876
DOWN TO HIS FEET!

00:21.918 --> 00:23.209
( electricity surges )

00:21.918 --> 00:23.209
CLEAR!

00:23.250 --> 00:25.250
WAIT, KAZ--

00:23.250 --> 00:25.250
WHAT ARE YOU--

00:23.250 --> 00:25.250
( electricity surges )

00:25.292 --> 00:26.542
( scattered applauding )

00:26.584 --> 00:28.292
OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU BOYS

00:26.584 --> 00:28.292
A TRIAL RUN.

00:28.334 --> 00:29.500
IF YOUR FRIEND HERE

00:28.334 --> 00:29.500
MESSES UP,

00:29.542 --> 00:31.500
I'M HOLDING  YOU  RESPONSIBLE.

00:31.542 --> 00:34.250
THIS IS AN ALL-DAY PROJECT,

00:31.542 --> 00:34.250
SO REMEMBER TO KEEP  GUS

00:34.292 --> 00:36.167
UNDER CONTROL  ALL DAY.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.500
DON'T WORRY.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.500
WE WON'T LET HIM

00:36.209 --> 00:38.500
ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.

00:38.542 --> 00:41.500
THIS IS THE WORST ROWBOAT

00:38.542 --> 00:41.500
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.542
WE'RE NOT MAKING

00:41.542 --> 00:43.542
A  ROWBOAT.

00:43.584 --> 00:45.876
WE'RE MAKING A  ROBOT.

00:45.918 --> 00:47.500
THIS COULD BE THE BEST

00:45.918 --> 00:47.500
AFTER-SCHOOL JOB EVER.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.125
AHH.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.042
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

00:51.083 --> 00:54.125
COMMEMORATIVE

00:51.083 --> 00:54.125
"I KAZZED THIS UP"

00:51.083 --> 00:54.125
FAKE PHOTO?

00:57.083 --> 00:59.918
KAZ, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?!

00:59.959 --> 01:02.626
NOW TECTON HAS A GIANT

00:59.959 --> 01:02.626
HOLE IN HIS CHEST.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.709
HEY, CALM DOWN.

01:03.751 --> 01:05.918
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:05.959 --> 01:06.542
( gasps, sighs )

01:06.584 --> 01:08.918
I HAVE THE PERFECT SOLUTION.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.626
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE

01:08.959 --> 01:11.626
A GIANT CORK ON YOU, WOULD YOU?

01:11.667 --> 01:12.584
'CAUSE...

01:12.626 --> 01:15.375
I ONLY HAVE THIS

01:12.626 --> 01:15.375
PRETTY BIG ONE.

01:15.417 --> 01:17.209
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

01:17.250 --> 01:19.375
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT

01:17.250 --> 01:19.375
WHY TECTON WON'T HEAL.

01:19.417 --> 01:22.042
YOU STAY HERE.

01:19.417 --> 01:22.042
A-AND DO WHAT?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.042
OH, IT'S SIMPLE.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.042
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

01:24.083 --> 01:26.042
IS KEEP OUT THE DOZENS

01:24.083 --> 01:26.042
AND DOZENS OF DOCTORS,

01:26.083 --> 01:27.959
NURSES, ORDERLIES,

01:26.083 --> 01:27.959
TECHNICIANS

01:28.000 --> 01:30.042
WHO COULD WALK IN

01:28.000 --> 01:30.042
AT ANY SECOND.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.042
I-IS THAT IT?

01:30.083 --> 01:32.042
( scoffs )

01:32.083 --> 01:34.042
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.209
EVERYTHING IS GOING

01:34.083 --> 01:36.209
TO BE FINE.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.584
HAVE I EVER

01:36.250 --> 01:37.584
LET YOU DOWN BEFORE?

01:37.626 --> 01:39.125
CONSTANTLY.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.959
NAME ONE TIME!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.459
WHEN YOU PULLED OUT

01:41.000 --> 01:43.459
THE STOP SIGN!

01:43.500 --> 01:45.459
THAT WAS 30 SECONDS AGO!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.626
STOP LIVING IN THE PAST.

01:47.667 --> 01:50.375
DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY

01:47.667 --> 01:50.375
CALL IT "THE PRESENT"?

01:50.417 --> 01:52.626
BECAUSE IT'S A GIFT.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.500
LAWLESS SOCIETY?

03:24.542 --> 03:26.292
BECAUSE IF WE ARE,

03:24.542 --> 03:26.292
I'D LIKE TO RIDE A MOTORCYCLE.

03:26.334 --> 03:28.167
AND I'D LIKE

03:46.375 --> 03:48.500
YEAH, HE JUST

03:46.375 --> 03:48.500

05:54.334 --> 05:56.500
WHY WOULD YOU

05:54.334 --> 05:56.500
SAY THAT TO HER?

05:54.334 --> 05:56.500
( sighs )

05:56.542 --> 05:58.542
I WAS WORRIED THERE

05:56.542 --> 05:58.542
FOR A SECOND.

05:58.584 --> 06:00.459
SO THAT'S  NOT  TRUE?

05:58.584 --> 06:00.459
OH, IT'S TRUE.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.876
I JUST WOULDN'T

06:00.500 --> 06:02.876
HAVE SAID IT LIKE THAT.

06:02.918 --> 06:04.667
IT'S HOPELESS?

06:04.709 --> 06:06.042
NOBODY'S SAYING

06:04.709 --> 06:06.042
IT'S HOPELESS.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.459
I AM.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.459
( chuckles )

06:08.626 --> 06:10.918
SKYLAR, RIGHT NOW,

06:10.959 --> 06:13.250
WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW

06:10.959 --> 06:13.250
HOW TO RESTORE YOUR POWERS.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.792
SOMEDAY WE MIGHT,

06:13.292 --> 06:15.792
BUT NOT NOW.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.834
I'M SORRY.

06:21.459 --> 06:22.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:22.751 --> 06:24.792
MY POWERS

06:22.751 --> 06:24.792
ARE IN ME SOMEWHERE--

06:22.751 --> 06:24.792
I KNOW IT--

06:24.834 --> 06:26.709
IF I JUST FOCUS.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.584
YOU CAN'T LIFT THAT.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.584
IT'S TOO HEAVY.

06:28.626 --> 06:31.542
I'M SKYLAR STORM,

06:28.626 --> 06:31.542
AND NOBODY TELLS ME

06:31.584 --> 06:33.292
WHAT I CAN OR CAN'T DO!

06:35.542 --> 06:37.876
( grunts )

06:38.876 --> 06:39.834
( grunts )

06:39.876 --> 06:41.292
IT'S GOING TO CRUSH YOU!

06:39.876 --> 06:41.292
LET ME HELP!

06:41.334 --> 06:43.417
DON'T YOU DARE!

06:43.459 --> 06:45.876
( grunting, groaning )

06:51.292 --> 06:53.125
I TOLD YOU NOT TO HELP ME!

06:53.167 --> 06:54.709
HEY, I SAVED YOUR LIFE!

06:54.751 --> 06:56.751
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT!

06:56.792 --> 07:00.667
I WAS VOTED MOST LIKELY

06:56.792 --> 07:00.667
TO  LOSE  A PATIENT.

07:02.709 --> 07:03.918
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

07:03.959 --> 07:05.250
WHY ISN'T TECTON HEALING?

07:05.292 --> 07:07.459
I DON'T KNOW.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.459
I GOT THE NEW TECTON COMIC BOOK,

07:07.500 --> 07:09.042
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.626
OH, I DO HAVE

07:09.083 --> 07:10.626
GOOD NEWS, THOUGH.

07:10.667 --> 07:14.626
WHAT?

07:10.667 --> 07:14.626
YOU KNOW THAT LONG LIST

07:10.667 --> 07:14.626
OF THINGS THAT JORDAN HATES?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.792
YEAH, WE'RE ON THAT NOW.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.125
WHY DID I VOUCH FOR YOU?!

07:19.167 --> 07:22.042
( sighs )

07:19.167 --> 07:22.042
SO MUCH FOR WORKING HERE.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.542
AND NOW THAT WE

07:22.083 --> 07:24.542
KNOW ABOUT MIGHTY MED,

07:24.584 --> 07:26.000
THEY'LL HAVE TO ERASE

07:24.584 --> 07:26.000
OUR MEMORIES

07:26.042 --> 07:28.250
OR--OR SHOOT US

07:26.042 --> 07:28.250
INTO A BLACK HOLE, OR--

07:28.292 --> 07:29.876
OR WORSE!

07:29.918 --> 07:32.751
WHAT'S WORSE THAN BEING

07:29.918 --> 07:32.751
SHOT INTO A BLACK HOLE?

07:32.792 --> 07:34.792
GETTING VAPORIZED.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.792
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET VAPORIZED

07:34.834 --> 07:36.792
IS THIS BUSINESS.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.626
Alan: OUT OF MY WAY!

07:38.667 --> 07:39.751
SOMEONE'S COMING.

07:45.626 --> 07:48.375
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

07:48.417 --> 07:49.876
I-IN THE WORLD?

07:49.918 --> 07:54.417
MOSTLY CHINA.

07:49.918 --> 07:54.417
AL--ALTHOUGH INDIA'S

07:49.918 --> 07:54.417
GAINING FAST.

07:54.459 --> 07:56.417
WHY ARE YOU

07:54.459 --> 07:56.417
STANDING LIKE THAT?

07:56.459 --> 07:58.834
STANDING LIKE WHAT?

07:58.876 --> 08:01.667
YEAH. THIS IS HOW

07:58.876 --> 08:01.667
NORMOS STAND.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.000
YEAH. GET WITH IT.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.042
OH, WELL, OKAY.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.375
I GUESS EVERYTHING'S

08:06.083 --> 08:07.375
FINE HERE.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.584
I SHOULD BE GOING.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.584
YEAH.

08:09.626 --> 08:10.918
OH, ONE MORE THING.

08:13.334 --> 08:14.500
BUSTED!

08:14.542 --> 08:17.042
THERE'S A GIANT HOLE

08:14.542 --> 08:17.042
IN HIS CHEST!

08:17.083 --> 08:20.375
ALAN, I-I KNOW WE DIDN'T

08:17.083 --> 08:20.375
START OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.542
BUT Y-YOU GOTTA HELP US.

08:22.584 --> 08:24.542
OH, WELL, OKAY.

08:24.584 --> 08:26.751
GRAB ME

08:24.584 --> 08:26.751
THE HOLE-CLOSING GLUE.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.334
OKAY. WHERE IS IT?

08:28.375 --> 08:31.709
IT'S RIGHT IN THE "NORMOS

08:28.375 --> 08:31.709
ARE INCREDIBLY STUPID" CABINET.

08:31.751 --> 08:34.042
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

08:31.751 --> 08:34.042
AS HOLE-CLOSING GLUE.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.792
BUT SERIOUSLY, QUICK,

08:34.082 --> 08:36.792
GRAB ME THE STOMACH SEALANT.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.042
ALL RIGHT.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.042
WHERE IS THAT?

08:38.082 --> 08:40.250
IT'S RIGHT ON THE

08:38.082 --> 08:40.250
"GOT YOU AGAIN" SHELF! HA!

08:41.792 --> 08:44.042
OH, YOU NORMOS

08:41.792 --> 08:44.042
ARE GOING DOWN.

08:44.082 --> 08:47.042
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

08:44.082 --> 08:47.042
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.417
EVERYBODY!

08:52.083 --> 08:53.751
THANKS, KAZ.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.626
THANKS FOR RUINING

08:53.792 --> 08:55.626
THE  ONE  THING

08:55.667 --> 08:57.626
THAT MADE ME FEEL LIKE

08:55.667 --> 08:57.626
I REALLY MATTERED.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.417
OLIVER, IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,

09:00.459 --> 09:02.042
YOU NEVER WOULD'VE

09:00.459 --> 09:02.042
FOUND THIS HOSPITAL.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.792
AND YOU NEVER WOULD

09:02.083 --> 09:03.792
HAVE DONE ANYTHING FUN

09:03.834 --> 09:06.751
LIKE RIDING A SKATEBOARD

09:03.834 --> 09:06.751
ON TOP OF A SKATEBOARD

09:06.792 --> 09:08.751
OR--OR PLAYING ICE FOOTBALL

09:08.792 --> 09:09.959
ON THAT FROZEN LAKE.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.792
I FELL IN!

09:10.000 --> 09:12.792
AH.

09:12.834 --> 09:16.626
I HAD TO BE EVACUATED

09:12.834 --> 09:16.626
TO THE HOSPITAL!

09:16.667 --> 09:18.959
YOU GOT TO RIDE

09:16.667 --> 09:18.959
IN A HELICOPTER!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.334
HOW FUN WAS THAT!

09:21.375 --> 09:24.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?!

09:21.375 --> 09:24.083
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.709
ALL YOU DO IS GET US

09:24.125 --> 09:26.709
INTO "RIDONKULOUS" SITUATIONS.

09:26.751 --> 09:28.042
OH, NO, I DON'T.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.292
WHOA, THIS IS

09:28.083 --> 09:30.292
A "RIDONKULOUS" SITUATION.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.959
I TOLD YOU

09:36.626 --> 09:38.959
THEY PULLED OUT THE SIGN!

09:39.000 --> 09:42.042
BOYS, I'M AFRAID YOU

09:39.000 --> 09:42.042
HAVE TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.834
HYPOTHETICALLY,

09:42.083 --> 09:44.834
IF YOU WERE TO BE COMPACTED

09:42.083 --> 09:44.834
INTO A SMALL CUBE,

09:44.876 --> 09:47.751
WHERE WOULD YOU

09:44.876 --> 09:47.751
WANT THAT SHIPPED?

09:47.792 --> 09:49.709
( flatline beeping )

09:50.709 --> 09:52.000
TECTON'S VITALS ARE DROPPING!

09:54.083 --> 09:56.334
WHAT WAS THAT?!

09:54.083 --> 09:56.334
TECTONIC TREMORS.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.042
TECTON'S POWERS

09:56.375 --> 09:58.042
ARE CONNECTED TO THE EARTH.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.792
WHEN HIS BODY'S IN DISTRESS,

09:58.083 --> 09:59.792
HE SENDS OUT

09:59.834 --> 10:01.500
UNCONTROLLABLE

09:59.834 --> 10:01.500
SEISMIC WAVES.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.667
WAIT. HE'S STABILIZING.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.667
HIS PULSE IS NORMAL.

10:06.709 --> 10:10.042
NO...THAT'S MY PULSE.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.626
THE GOOD NEWS--

10:10.083 --> 10:12.626
( chuckles )

10:10.083 --> 10:12.626
I'M FINE.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.000
BUT, UH, HE'S,

10:13.834 --> 10:16.000
LIKE, ALMOST DEAD.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.417
WE'RE UP NEXT.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.417
BECAUSE OF KAZ AND OLIVER,

10:23.459 --> 10:24.918
WE'RE GETTING AN "F."

10:24.959 --> 10:26.792
SO MUCH FOR VIDEO GAMES.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.959
MY PARENT'S ARE GONNA

10:26.834 --> 10:28.959
MAKE ME GO OUTSIDE

10:29.000 --> 10:31.375
IN THE SUNSHINE

10:29.000 --> 10:31.375
AND FRESH AIR.

10:31.417 --> 10:32.626
UGH!

10:34.834 --> 10:36.459
Jordan: WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.667
I HAVE AN IDEA.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.918
SUNGLASSES FOR FISH?

10:37.709 --> 10:40.918
BEAT YOU TO IT.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.584
DUCK AND COVER!

10:43.500 --> 10:46.584
NO MORE PRESENTATIONS!

10:46.626 --> 10:48.000
EVERYONE SHOULD

10:46.626 --> 10:48.000
GET AN "A."

10:50.876 --> 10:52.876
( rapid beeping )

10:50.876 --> 10:52.876
WE HAVE TO SAVE HIM!

10:52.918 --> 10:55.792
IF HE DIES, NO ONE

10:52.918 --> 10:55.792
WILL BE ABLE TO STOP MEGAHERTZ!

10:55.834 --> 10:57.751
AND HE'LL CONTINUE

10:55.834 --> 10:57.751
HIS REIGN OF TERROR!

10:57.792 --> 10:59.500
( stammering )

10:57.792 --> 10:59.500
I CAN'T LET TECTON DIE.

10:59.542 --> 11:00.751
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

11:01.918 --> 11:04.918
OH, SOMETHING'S INTERFERING

11:01.918 --> 11:04.918
WITH HIS ABILITY TO HEAL,

11:04.959 --> 11:07.042
SO, QUICK--THINK OF EVERYTHING

11:04.959 --> 11:07.042
YOU KNOW ABOUT TECTON,

11:07.083 --> 11:08.792
STARTING WITH HIS

11:07.083 --> 11:08.792
VERY FIRST COMIC BOOK!

11:08.834 --> 11:11.042
OKAY,  THE ADVENTURES

11:08.834 --> 11:11.042
OF TECTON,  ISSUE ONE,

11:11.083 --> 11:12.667
COPYRIGHT 1975.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.042
OH, MY GOSH!

11:12.709 --> 11:14.042
FLIP AHEAD!

11:14.083 --> 11:16.083
OKAY, UH--UH--

11:14.083 --> 11:16.083
HE GETS HIS POWERS

11:16.125 --> 11:18.042
FROM THE DELTA RADIATION

11:16.125 --> 11:18.042
WHICH EMANATES

11:18.083 --> 11:19.584
FROM THE METEORITE

11:18.083 --> 11:19.584
IN HIS CHEST--

11:19.626 --> 11:21.042
AND HIS ONLY WEAKNESS

11:19.626 --> 11:21.042
IS GARGULON GAS,

11:21.083 --> 11:23.751
BUT...DOESN'T EXIST ON EARTH

11:21.083 --> 11:23.751
IN ITS NATURAL FORM.

11:23.792 --> 11:24.918
OH!

11:24.959 --> 11:26.584
WELL GARGULON GAS

11:24.959 --> 11:26.584
IS FORMED WHEN--

11:26.626 --> 11:28.542
Both: DELTA RADIATION

11:26.626 --> 11:28.542
REACTS WITH GOLD!

11:28.584 --> 11:30.500
OKAY, THEN THERE MUST

11:28.584 --> 11:30.500
BE GOLD INSIDE OF HIM.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.042
( sighs )

11:30.542 --> 11:33.042
I'M GOING IN.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.042
OKAY.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.459
UH. ICKY. GROSS.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.918
( groaning )

11:37.959 --> 11:39.834
GOT IT.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.834
( chuckling )

11:39.876 --> 11:41.667
GOLD COIN...

11:39.876 --> 11:41.667
YEAH.

11:41.709 --> 11:44.083
COVERED IN GUTS.

11:41.709 --> 11:44.083
YEAH.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.751
( sighs )

11:44.125 --> 11:45.751
MUST'VE GOTTEN IN THERE

11:45.792 --> 11:47.834
WHEN HE STOPPED MEGAHERTZ

11:45.792 --> 11:47.834
FROM ROBBING THAT BANK.

11:47.876 --> 11:49.042
HE'S STARTING TO HEAL!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.167
WELL DONE, GENTLEMEN!

11:51.209 --> 11:54.167
YOU WERE RIGHT!

11:51.209 --> 11:54.167
YOU  DO  MAKE A GREAT TEAM!

11:54.209 --> 11:56.042
( scattered applause )

11:56.083 --> 11:57.792
WHAT?!

11:57.834 --> 12:00.042
B-BUT THEY BROKE THE RULES!

12:00.083 --> 12:01.918
AND THEN THEY SAVED THE DAY!

12:01.959 --> 12:04.250
SO I'M GONNA TOTALLY

12:01.959 --> 12:04.250
IGNORE THE FIRST PART.

12:04.292 --> 12:05.584
AH.

12:05.626 --> 12:08.042

GET THE LIMBO STICK.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.709
THERE YOU ARE.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.709
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

12:14.751 --> 12:17.500
AGAIN WITH THE VIDEOS

12:14.751 --> 12:17.500
OF YOU DOING BACKFLIPS?

12:17.542 --> 12:20.042
WE GET IT.

12:17.542 --> 12:20.042
YOU'RE FLEXIBLE.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.042
HEY--THAT VIDEO

12:20.083 --> 12:22.042
HAS 56 "LIKES."

12:22.083 --> 12:23.918
AND ONE "DISLIKE."

12:23.959 --> 12:25.667
THAT'S NOT WHAT

12:23.959 --> 12:25.667
I NEED TO SHOW YOU!

12:25.709 --> 12:26.876
( TV beeps )

12:26.918 --> 12:29.626
SUPERHERO NEWS NETWORK

12:26.918 --> 12:29.626

12:29.667 --> 12:33.042

12:39.209 --> 12:41.042
THIS...

12:39.209 --> 12:41.042
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE,

12:41.083 --> 12:43.918
A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS CLEARLY

12:41.083 --> 12:43.918
DISGUISING HIS VOICE

12:43.959 --> 12:47.042
BY SPEAKING

12:43.959 --> 12:47.042
INTO A COFFEE MUG.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.584
WELL THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

12:49.876 --> 12:51.667
ALAN, YOU REALIZE

12:49.876 --> 12:51.667
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

12:51.709 --> 12:53.709
NOW MEGAHERTZ KNOWS

12:51.709 --> 12:53.709
THAT TECTON IS HERE

12:53.751 --> 12:54.792
AND WEAK!

12:54.834 --> 12:56.876
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!

12:54.834 --> 12:56.876
BIG TROUBLE!

12:56.918 --> 12:59.751
OH, COME ON.

12:56.918 --> 12:59.751
WHAT ARE THE ODDS

12:56.918 --> 12:59.751
MEGAHERTZ WAS WATCHING

12:59.792 --> 13:02.918
AT THAT EXACT MOMENT?

12:59.792 --> 13:02.918
( thunder cracking )

13:02.959 --> 13:05.000
Megahertz:  WHERE IS HE?!

13:05.042 --> 13:07.584
WHERE IS TECTON?

13:07.626 --> 13:10.000
I'D SAY, "100%."

13:12.959 --> 13:13.959
( yells )

13:14.000 --> 13:15.959
WHERE IS TECTON?!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.042
( clamoring indistinctly )

13:16.000 --> 13:18.042
( growls )

13:18.083 --> 13:19.918
GUARDS, GET HIM!

13:19.959 --> 13:22.042
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY

13:19.959 --> 13:22.042
TO STOP ME?

13:22.083 --> 13:23.292
HOW QUAINT.

13:23.334 --> 13:24.959
( yells )

13:26.083 --> 13:28.918
OH, HE'S GOOD.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.918
I'LL GRANT HIM THAT.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.959
( roaring )

13:33.292 --> 13:34.542
( shrieking )

13:36.125 --> 13:37.751
( grunting )

13:37.792 --> 13:39.042
MEGAHERTZ

13:37.792 --> 13:39.042
IS GONNA FIGHT TECTON!

13:39.083 --> 13:40.876
WE'VE  GOT  TO DO SOMETHING!

13:40.918 --> 13:41.959
WHAT? WE DON'T

13:40.918 --> 13:41.959
HAVE ANY POWERS.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.667
NEITHER DO I.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.042
BUT  I  CAN STILL DO THIS.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.834
HEY, MEGAHERTZ!

13:48.042 --> 13:49.667
THERE'S A STORM COMING--

13:49.709 --> 13:51.000
SKYLAR STORM.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.292
THAT'S MY BOO.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.000
( roars )

14:07.042 --> 14:08.834
( panting )

14:07.042 --> 14:08.834
I CAN'T FREEZE HIM.

14:08.876 --> 14:11.000
HIS ELECTRICAL FIELD

14:08.876 --> 14:11.000
IS BLOCKING MY POWERS.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.250
( grunting )

14:17.250 --> 14:18.667
Oliver: ( stammers ) KAZ,

14:18.709 --> 14:19.918
SKYLAR CAN'T HOLD HIM

14:18.709 --> 14:19.918
OFF FOR LONG!

14:19.959 --> 14:22.000
WE'VE GOT

14:19.959 --> 14:22.000
TO CREATE A DIVERSION!

14:22.042 --> 14:23.250
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

14:22.042 --> 14:23.250
TO DO WHAT YOU DO BEST.

14:23.292 --> 14:25.125
GET ON PEOPLE'S NERVES?

14:23.292 --> 14:25.125
EXACTLY.

14:25.167 --> 14:26.167
ALL RIGHT.

14:30.918 --> 14:31.918
( grunts )

14:38.083 --> 14:39.083
( yells )

14:40.876 --> 14:41.876
OH!

14:43.292 --> 14:46.000
HEY, LESLIE--

14:46.042 --> 14:48.292
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:46.042 --> 14:48.292
I KNOW YOUR REAL NAME.

14:48.334 --> 14:51.167
CHECK OUT THE UGLIEST

14:48.334 --> 14:51.167
HALF-HUMAN, HALF-TITANIUM

14:51.209 --> 14:53.042
CYBORG IN THE ROOM.

14:53.083 --> 14:56.959
OH, COME ON!

14:53.083 --> 14:56.959
NO ONE LOOKS GOOD

14:53.083 --> 14:56.959
IN A METAL TRAY!

14:58.042 --> 15:01.000
AND NO ONE CALLS ME UGLY!

15:03.083 --> 15:04.334
OLIVER, NOW!

15:20.918 --> 15:22.918
( Kaz snorts, chuckles )

15:22.959 --> 15:25.042
YOU KNOW, I MEANT "UGLY"

15:25.083 --> 15:26.375
I-IN A  GOOD  WAY.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.751
UH, YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH--

15:27.792 --> 15:31.042
"YO, PLAYA.

15:27.792 --> 15:31.042
YOU SO UGLY."

15:31.083 --> 15:32.959
THAT'S NOT A THING.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
NOW, SAY "GOOD-BYE"

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
TO YOUR PRECIOUS TECTON.

15:37.042 --> 15:38.959
( growling )

15:43.000 --> 15:43.959
WHAT DO WE DO?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.959
I-IT'S OVER.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.918
HE'S GONNA DESTROY TECTON.

15:48.876 --> 15:50.000
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

15:58.209 --> 16:01.042
AND  THAT'S  HOW YOU

15:58.209 --> 16:01.042
THROW A VILLAIN

16:01.083 --> 16:02.000
THOUGH A LOGO.

16:08.292 --> 16:09.751
( growls )

16:18.209 --> 16:19.417
LOOK OUT!

16:46.417 --> 16:48.167
( both grunting )

16:51.334 --> 16:53.918
WE'VE GOT TO STOP

16:51.334 --> 16:53.918
MEGAHERTZ SOMEHOW!

16:53.959 --> 16:55.918
"STOP"!

16:53.959 --> 16:55.918
HUH! THAT'S IT!

16:58.083 --> 16:59.459

17:01.042 --> 17:02.250

17:02.292 --> 17:03.542

17:08.209 --> 17:10.791
( growling )

17:14.375 --> 17:15.917

17:15.959 --> 17:18.083
NOT SO TOUGH NOW,

17:15.959 --> 17:18.083
ARE YOU, LESLIE?

17:18.125 --> 17:21.459
( grunts )

17:18.125 --> 17:21.459
( yelps )

17:18.125 --> 17:21.459
STILL ALIVE. STILL ALIVE.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.876
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

17:26.917 --> 17:28.041
YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.500
THIS PLACE NEEDS YOU.

17:29.542 --> 17:33.042
( gasps )

17:29.542 --> 17:33.042
ACT COOL.

17:29.542 --> 17:33.042
ACT COOL. ACT COOL.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.083
( high-pitched )

17:33.083 --> 17:34.083
THANK YOU.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.000
( sighs )

17:34.125 --> 17:36.000
DANG IT.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.959
WELL, MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.500
ACTUALLY,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.500
JUST ONE MORE THING.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.459
THAT BULB HAS BEEN

17:40.542 --> 17:42.459
OUT FOR WEEKS.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.500
WOULD YOU MIND?

17:44.542 --> 17:46.834
YEAH, YEAH.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.167
SKYLAR, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:52.209 --> 17:54.042
I'M FINE.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.042
YOU WERE  AWESOME 

17:54.083 --> 17:56.042
BACK THERE.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.918
SO WERE YOU.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.918
( sighs )

17:57.959 --> 17:59.459
WELL, I DO THROW

17:57.959 --> 17:59.459
A MEAN BEDPAN.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.500
LOOK, I-I KNOW YOU

17:59.500 --> 18:02.500
DON'T LIKE PEOPLE HELPING YOU,

18:02.542 --> 18:05.042
BUT I'M GONNA

18:02.542 --> 18:05.042
DO  EVERYTHING  I CAN

18:05.083 --> 18:06.500
TO HELP YOU

18:05.083 --> 18:06.500
GET YOUR POWERS BACK.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.042
THAT WOULD BE GREAT

18:08.083 --> 18:10.167
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE

18:08.083 --> 18:10.167
"BEING A NORMO" THING

18:10.209 --> 18:12.000
TOTALLY STINKS.

18:12.042 --> 18:13.542
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.959
SHOWOFF.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.042
HEY, LISTEN.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.042

18:23.083 --> 18:26.042

18:28.083 --> 18:29.626
AND YOU BAILED ME OUT.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.626
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.042
THANKS.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.542
I'M SORRY, TOO.

18:35.584 --> 18:37.042
AND, YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.125
I WOULDN'T BE HERE

18:37.083 --> 18:39.125
WITHOUT YOU.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.042
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.375
COMMEMORATIVE

18:41.083 --> 18:43.375
"BROS AGAIN" FAKE PHOTO?

18:43.417 --> 18:44.542
ABSOLUTELY.

18:43.417 --> 18:44.542
ALL RIGHT.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.042
( imitates camera

18:46.459 --> 18:48.042
shutter clicking )

18:48.083 --> 18:50.042
SPLENDID WORK TODAY.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.042
SPLENDID!

18:51.083 --> 18:52.292
I'LL SEE YOU BOYS

18:53.667 --> 18:55.042
WHAT?!

18:55.083 --> 18:56.584
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEWSCAST?

18:56.626 --> 18:58.542
EVERYONE KNOWS

18:56.626 --> 18:58.542
WE HAVE NORMOS HERE.

18:58.584 --> 19:00.042
I DON'T CARE.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.042
LET THE WHOLE WORLD

19:00.083 --> 19:02.042
KNOW THE WORK HERE.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.709
REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T

19:02.083 --> 19:03.709
TELL ANYONE YOU WORK HERE.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.751
THIS IS NOT FAIR!

19:03.751 --> 19:06.751
THIS IS NOT--

19:08.083 --> 19:09.584
NOW, LET'S GO DOWN

19:08.083 --> 19:09.584
TO ACCOUNTING

19:09.626 --> 19:12.125
AND GET YOU PAID.

19:09.626 --> 19:12.125
PAID? ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:12.167 --> 19:13.584
I WOULD TOTALLY

19:12.167 --> 19:13.584
WORK HERE FOR NOTHING.

19:13.626 --> 19:15.125
HE MEANT...

19:15.167 --> 19:18.375
"NOTHING LESS

19:15.167 --> 19:18.375
THAN $1 MILLION A WEEK."

19:19.709 --> 19:23.000
"$1,000 A WEEK."

19:25.042 --> 19:27.542
"$100 A WEEK."

19:27.584 --> 19:30.042
I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU 200,

19:27.584 --> 19:30.042
BUT 100 IT IS.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.751
( scoffs )

19:31.792 --> 19:33.667
SO, HOW DO YOU

19:31.792 --> 19:33.667
LIKE YOUR NEW SCRUBS?

19:33.709 --> 19:35.417
WE'RE NOT IN SCRUBS.

19:35.459 --> 19:36.542
YOU WERE.

19:36.584 --> 19:38.542
MMM--THAT'S A PICTURE

19:36.584 --> 19:38.542
OF A BRIDGE.

19:38.584 --> 19:41.209
HUH. I LOVE BRIDGES!

19:41.250 --> 19:44.042
SAY--SAY "WE'RE NOT

19:41.250 --> 19:44.042
IN SCRUBS" AGAIN.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.626
WE'RE NOT IN SCRUBS.

19:45.667 --> 19:46.709
YOU WERE.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.375
( sighs )

19:54.792 --> 19:57.375
WHY DID THOSE TREMORS

19:54.792 --> 19:57.375
HAVE TO STOP?

19:57.417 --> 20:00.042
I  CANNOT  CATCH A BREAK.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.042
( door opens )

20:00.083 --> 20:02.042
JORDAN, THERE YOU ARE.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.209
( sighs )

20:02.083 --> 20:04.209
LOOK, W-WE'RE SORRY

20:04.250 --> 20:05.792
ABOUT NOT BEING HERE

20:04.250 --> 20:05.792

20:05.834 --> 20:07.042
YEAH, WE KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

20:07.083 --> 20:08.584
AND YOU HAVE

20:07.083 --> 20:08.584
EVERY  RIGHT TO BE.

20:08.626 --> 20:10.792
OKAY, BUT I'M SURE

20:08.626 --> 20:10.792
YOU'RE GONNA DO FINE

20:08.626 --> 20:10.792
ON YOUR PROJECT.

20:10.834 --> 20:11.792
I MEAN...

20:10.834 --> 20:11.792
( chuckles )

20:11.834 --> 20:13.751
LOOK AT WHAT

20:11.834 --> 20:13.751
YOU'RE UP AGAINST.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.709
THAT'S OURS.

20:15.751 --> 20:18.042
OH, MOMMA.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.125
( mutters )

20:18.083 --> 20:20.125
I THINK I KNOW HOW

20:18.083 --> 20:20.125
TO MAKE THIS BETTER.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.292
DON'T GET IN IT.

20:21.334 --> 20:22.626
I TRIED THAT ALREADY.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.000
I TOOK A LITTLE SOUVENIR

20:24.250 --> 20:27.000
FROM MEGAHERTZ.

20:27.709 --> 20:30.042
YOU TOOK ONE OF HIS

20:27.709 --> 20:30.042
POWER BOOSTERS?

20:30.083 --> 20:31.751
( gasps )

20:30.083 --> 20:31.751
DID YOU GET HIM TO SIGN IT?

20:37.083 --> 20:38.792
THIS IS OUR PROJECT.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.167
WE MADE IT OUT OF...

20:40.209 --> 20:42.209
UH, WHO CARES.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.459
( electricity surging )

20:46.125 --> 20:48.584
( jets roaring )

20:52.417 --> 20:53.834
( glass shatters )

20:53.876 --> 20:57.000
NOW  THAT'S  A ROWBOAT.

21:04.709 --> 21:08.209
I WOULD LIKE TO BUY

21:04.709 --> 21:08.209
THE METEORITE OF ZANDOR.

21:08.250 --> 21:11.042
OKAY, AND JUST HOW ARE YOU

21:08.250 --> 21:11.042
ABLE TO AFFORD

21:11.083 --> 21:13.667
SUCH AN INCREDIBLY

21:11.083 --> 21:13.667
RARE ARTIFACT?

21:13.709 --> 21:15.667
YES, IT'S THE ONLY ONE

21:13.709 --> 21:15.667
OF ITS KIND

21:15.709 --> 21:17.417
IN THE WORLD.

21:18.792 --> 21:22.626
I GOT THIS MONEY

21:18.792 --> 21:22.626
FROM MIGHTY MED.

21:22.667 --> 21:23.792
MIGHTY MED?

21:22.667 --> 21:23.792
WHAT'S THAT?

21:23.834 --> 21:25.792
UH, MI-MIGHTY MED.
