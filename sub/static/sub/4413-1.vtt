<i>God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change...</i>

00:41.107 --> 00:44.160
Nah, man. Back off.
I'm about to be there.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.479
Yo, she's not feeling you
like that, dude.

00:47.123 --> 00:50.984
<i>The courage to change
the things that I can...</i>

00:51.084 --> 00:52.468
Nah, it's Stephon.
You know what I'm saying?

00:52.568 --> 00:55.803
Just tell her I said I'm coming,
and everything's gonna be all good.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.215
<i>And the wisdom to know the difference.</i>

01:40.982 --> 01:43.433
I'm gonna return Ben's dish.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.523
And he said he'll take me to school.

01:46.623 --> 01:49.225
He said he'd take me the rest
of the week so you could rest, okay?

01:49.325 --> 01:50.894
Okay.

01:51.394 --> 01:52.966
Mom.

01:55.331 --> 01:56.966
You should take this. Wear it.

01:57.066 --> 02:00.037
No. No, no, Justin.
You don't have to do that.

02:00.137 --> 02:04.557
- I promise it will help.
- Justin, no. You go to school. It's okay.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.782
It's okay.

02:34.804 --> 02:37.543
Please, help me.

02:38.409 --> 02:42.245
...and before you eat another piece
of cake, open your brother's gift.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.797
- Nice wrapping, Justin.
- Cool, right?

02:47.897 --> 02:49.929
Well, you did use a lot of tape, dude.

02:55.857 --> 02:59.876
A new watch?
What do I need with a new...

03:03.832 --> 03:05.801
It's real nice.

03:05.901 --> 03:10.787
It's real shiny. Mom helped pick it out.
It's kind of from the both of us.

03:10.887 --> 03:13.777
Okay, I get it.
I was late again, so a new watch.

03:13.877 --> 03:16.901
That's not it. Open my gift.

03:21.048 --> 03:24.533
- Okay. Good looking out, ma.
- No. Look again.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.430
Look again.

03:35.964 --> 03:38.401
Oh, man!

03:38.501 --> 03:41.604
The city got new ones, so I got
a really good one second-hand.

03:41.704 --> 03:43.505
Come on, now.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.662
Oh, man. This is great.

03:46.843 --> 03:48.952
It has a little camera, too.
So when you go off to college,

03:49.052 --> 03:51.784
Mom will get us another computer
so we can see you <i>and</i> talk to you.

03:51.884 --> 03:55.014
I thought you might like it.
And we could put it right here.

03:55.114 --> 03:56.646
Here?

03:57.173 --> 03:59.296
I thought you got it just for me.

03:59.396 --> 04:00.510
I did get it for you.

04:00.610 --> 04:03.813
Yeah, but it's like I got to sign for it
before I can use it or something.

04:04.213 --> 04:06.781
Dude, come on now.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.460
All I'm saying is I'm a man now.

04:30.071 --> 04:33.604
I feel good. Well...

04:34.610 --> 04:37.004
Not exactly good, I guess.

04:38.514 --> 04:42.683
I ran into this old picture of Charles
in the back of a drawer.

04:44.619 --> 04:49.423
It felt good, the memory,
instead of painful.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.629
He's a cutie.

04:53.429 --> 04:57.091
If you want the truth,
that is one sweet face.

04:58.270 --> 05:02.371
So I feel like I'm getting there.

05:02.471 --> 05:04.640
I'm getting to accept God's will.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.511
Oh, and I brought y'all some
of my lemon squares for the break.

05:08.611 --> 05:11.345
- They were his favorite.
- Thank you, Patrice.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.650
Go ahead, girl.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.988
So, we're mothers.

05:19.088 --> 05:22.291
Our maternal instinct
is to protect our child.

05:22.691 --> 05:25.258
And when the worst happens,

05:25.358 --> 05:28.030
when that child is murdered,

05:28.930 --> 05:31.721
we feel guilt, depression,

05:31.821 --> 05:34.470
we feel we failed.

05:34.570 --> 05:39.709
We lose our homes, our minds,
and sometimes our lives.

05:39.809 --> 05:42.379
So get a sponsor.

05:42.979 --> 05:47.216
Find someone that you can talk to,

05:47.650 --> 05:51.087
get out, get a hobby,

05:51.187 --> 05:54.423
get to acceptance somehow

05:54.723 --> 05:58.025
so that you can get on to living, right?

06:02.363 --> 06:05.065
Now, I think I see a new face.

06:12.807 --> 06:16.277
I'm Lila Walcott. I'm... here.

06:18.713 --> 06:21.217
I work for the city.

06:21.317 --> 06:24.686
I was a clerk in public records. I...

06:26.589 --> 06:29.191
Now I'm on leave.

06:29.291 --> 06:31.759
My son Stephon was m...

06:33.863 --> 06:35.865
Step back, please, ma'am. Ma'am?

06:36.365 --> 06:38.515
- I need you... you can't be in here.
- Stephon!

06:41.102 --> 06:42.771
- It's all right.
- You don't have to say it.

06:42.871 --> 06:44.390
You take your time.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.709
Stephon? Stephon, are you with us?

06:46.809 --> 06:50.146
- Can you hear me?
- Stephon!

06:51.513 --> 06:55.449
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- You shouldn't say it. It's okay.

06:57.985 --> 07:03.276
I hear y'all, but...
Stephon is dead, and I...

07:04.993 --> 07:06.126
I want to...

07:09.230 --> 07:11.332
You want him back.

07:13.835 --> 07:15.691
Finish, Lila.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.886
You want... what?

07:22.176 --> 07:24.944
To thank y'all for inviting me.

07:26.281 --> 07:28.359
You're welcome.

07:48.703 --> 07:50.977
Did you get a hobby yet?

07:51.639 --> 07:55.011
Your son's dead, and they tell you
to start collecting stamps or something.

07:55.111 --> 07:56.379
Well, they're just trying to help.

07:56.679 --> 07:59.446
Yeah, it's funny how everyone wants
to help when there's nothing they can do.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.519
I keep getting cards, you know?

08:03.619 --> 08:07.924
First from the detective and the reverend.
Just got another one in there.

08:08.224 --> 08:11.360
Maybe that could be your hobby,
collecting cards.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.596
Or getting advice.

08:13.796 --> 08:15.720
Oh, yeah.

08:16.198 --> 08:21.138
I had this interior-design job.
And my boss said to me, real nice...

08:22.138 --> 08:25.908
- "you can have another kid".
- I think I heard that one.

08:26.008 --> 08:29.682
"Well, at least you have another son".
Like I had one to spare.

08:29.782 --> 08:33.580
Telling you, man. Talk is meaningless.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.758
Tell me about yours.

08:39.488 --> 08:40.953
Then I'd be talking.

08:41.253 --> 08:44.633
You know, they said to get a sponsor,
someone to talk to, and...

08:44.733 --> 08:47.394
- if you're interested...
- In being yours?

08:50.266 --> 08:53.335
That's... that's sweet, but not smart.

08:53.735 --> 08:56.338
This is... this whole thing
is not my scene.

08:56.438 --> 08:59.141
Just being here makes me feel
fucking useless.

08:59.241 --> 09:02.809
Wait a minute. Maybe give it a chance.
I really feel like I can talk to you.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.364
Here's my number,
but it's not me you should be calling.

09:17.464 --> 09:20.496
Well, I've called the police, but...
what about you?

09:20.596 --> 09:22.898
- Did they find the person...
- They barely even looked.

09:22.998 --> 09:24.886
My little girl,

09:26.430 --> 09:28.601
she wasn't real to them.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.309
You know how it is. We think about her
all the time, but nobody else does.

09:33.409 --> 09:35.111
They don't think about us.

09:36.111 --> 09:38.574
Hell, they don't even <i>see</i> us.

09:39.614 --> 09:42.154
I'll keep on it. I'll keep calling.

09:43.385 --> 09:44.871
Yeah. Good luck with that.

10:10.168 --> 10:11.302
- Ma'am?
- You know what? I've had a seat.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.750
I've had enough. I've been waiting for
an hour. Is detective Holliston even here?

10:14.850 --> 10:17.153
Ma'am, I paged him.
Would you like to leave a message?

10:17.553 --> 10:20.256
- Detective Holliston!
- Can I help you?

10:20.656 --> 10:22.491
I called about my son's case,

10:22.591 --> 10:24.860
and no one got back to me,
so I thought I'd come down.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.696
What case is it again?

10:28.491 --> 10:31.272
You don't... you don't remember me?

10:31.467 --> 10:34.173
Sure, I do. It's just I've got
a lot to keep track of.

10:34.603 --> 10:35.637
Tell me again.

10:35.737 --> 10:36.939
- Ms. Walcott.
- Yeah.

10:37.039 --> 10:38.441
- You're here for an update.
- If you wouldn't mind.

10:38.541 --> 10:40.809
We canvassed the neighborhood,
but, sorry to say, nothing yet.

10:40.909 --> 10:43.162
We're just gonna have to keep looking
till we get the break we need, ma'am.

10:43.262 --> 10:45.371
My son was just walking down
the street. I have another son.

10:45.471 --> 10:48.382
- What am I supposed to do?
- If it were me, I'd move.

10:50.235 --> 10:54.073
Ms. Walcott. Ms. Walcott, listen.
There's more. Just...

10:54.173 --> 10:55.939
Can I speak to you for a minute?

10:58.359 --> 11:00.729
Here's what we know. We attained a lot.

11:00.829 --> 11:04.566
Essentially, every corner
is a piece of property.

11:04.666 --> 11:06.468
And every piece of property
has a landlord.

11:06.568 --> 11:09.238
You work the corner, you pay rent.
We see it a lot.

11:09.638 --> 11:12.941
This guy Ray, he was freelancing.

11:13.141 --> 11:16.378
They warned him,
they didn't warn him, we don't know.

11:16.478 --> 11:20.182
What we do know is that somebody
driving by in a black S.U.V. took him out.

11:20.582 --> 11:23.586
- Who did? Who... who are they?
- Nobody will tell us anything.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.088
We see it a lot, too.

11:27.388 --> 11:29.358
We need evidence.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.994
One lead, one name.

11:32.094 --> 11:35.162
- Without that...
- You'll forget all about it.

11:46.607 --> 11:48.778
So, I went to the police.

11:48.878 --> 11:53.184
And they don't know anything,
and they're not trying to know anything.

11:55.383 --> 11:58.012
I can't stop thinking about it,
you know?

11:59.154 --> 12:03.581
I mean, this is something that goes
way past any kind of pain I ever felt

12:03.681 --> 12:05.787
or experienced.

12:06.428 --> 12:09.688
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.466
I just...

12:16.370 --> 12:17.640
I want to...

12:18.740 --> 12:20.743
We all know what you want.

12:20.843 --> 12:23.278
You want to hold him again.

12:23.378 --> 12:25.120
You want your son back.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.783
You want the ones responsible.

12:28.283 --> 12:30.786
- You want peace.
- You want to hear his voice.

12:30.886 --> 12:32.888
You want a good night's sleep.

12:33.288 --> 12:35.322
You want them to know how it feels.

12:36.958 --> 12:40.028
I mean, we all live here, right?
And we shut it out somehow.

12:40.128 --> 12:43.196
But I can't anymore.

12:43.798 --> 12:45.501
Can you?

12:46.201 --> 12:51.640
God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change,

12:51.740 --> 12:54.843
the courage to change
the things that I can,

12:54.943 --> 12:57.212
and the wisdom to know the difference.

12:57.312 --> 12:59.947
Wisdom to know the difference.

13:17.999 --> 13:21.503
- Age doesn't make a man, Stephon.
- Well, you treat me like I'm 8 years old.

13:21.603 --> 13:23.572
A real man keeps his word

13:23.672 --> 13:27.909
and he is where he's supposed to be
when he's supposed to be.

13:28.309 --> 13:30.112
That's what I know.

13:31.293 --> 13:33.115
Fine.

13:33.415 --> 13:35.148
I'll call next time if you want.

13:36.551 --> 13:38.153
I do want.

13:38.253 --> 13:40.889
Because I know you don't want me
to go out there looking for you.

13:41.389 --> 13:43.826
- Like that would ever happen.
- Yeah.

13:43.926 --> 13:46.462
Yeah, and wipe your mouth, Jay Z.

13:46.562 --> 13:48.964
Wipe all the cake off your mouth.

13:49.064 --> 13:50.831
Jay Z.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.699
Thank you.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.438
Thanks, ma.

14:26.368 --> 14:30.572
Here I am, reporting for sponsor duty.

14:31.593 --> 14:34.744
Thanks for coming. I mean it.

14:36.898 --> 14:40.949
- Just came to see if you're okay.
- Yeah. No.

14:41.149 --> 14:43.592
I don't know what I am.

14:47.288 --> 14:49.726
Well, it's like a hospital in here.

14:49.826 --> 14:55.030
You need to cheer this place up
with some color, strength.

14:55.884 --> 14:57.331
Like Tina Turner strength.

14:59.117 --> 15:01.910
Although that sister did put up
with some serious bullshit.

15:02.010 --> 15:03.989
- You seen Ike?
- Girl, he's a little, skinny man.

15:04.089 --> 15:05.637
Like Somalia skinny.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.344
I mean, the first time he raised his hand,
she should have just broke him in two.

15:11.964 --> 15:13.967
Used them legs on him.

15:19.954 --> 15:22.223
So, you went to see the police?

15:23.959 --> 15:25.764
Feel better?

15:26.428 --> 15:28.829
I feel...

15:29.145 --> 15:31.037
forgotten.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.121
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

15:35.236 --> 15:37.291
Well, I'll give you a tip.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.576
Stop cleaning.

15:40.676 --> 15:43.979
That goes back to when I was a little girl
and I would hear my folks fighting.

15:44.279 --> 15:46.983
I'd straighten up and clean
as a way of making things better,

15:47.083 --> 15:49.384
feeling in control.

15:49.484 --> 15:51.854
You know what they said? Get a hobby.
Why don't you fix the place up?

15:51.954 --> 15:55.324
Shit, give it a facelift. You know,
I used to be an interior decorator.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.960
I could help you.

15:59.451 --> 16:02.164
I don't know. I'm going back
to work next week part time.

16:02.264 --> 16:04.902
I don't know if I want to be
spending money fixing this place up.

16:05.002 --> 16:07.663
Please. It won't cost nothing
to pull up this nasty-ass carpet

16:07.763 --> 16:09.064
and burn it with the trash.

16:09.164 --> 16:12.207
It was here when I moved in.
I never much liked it, but...

16:13.151 --> 16:14.276
Let's pull it up.

16:14.676 --> 16:18.856
You know, sometimes, they got some
real nice hardwood floor underneath here.

16:18.956 --> 16:22.549
- Right here in the corner.
- I don't know why Justin keeps his bookbag...

16:26.721 --> 16:29.756
See? It's already peeling up
here in the corner.

16:38.008 --> 16:39.065
Oh, my God.

16:43.537 --> 16:44.773
Oh, my God.

16:44.873 --> 16:49.077
You know, maybe he was...
maybe he was scared.

16:49.177 --> 16:50.944
Maybe he was angry.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.815
Maybe he just wanted to protect you.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.905
Why would... why would he do...
do something like that?

17:00.005 --> 17:02.138
What is he supposed to do?

17:03.591 --> 17:06.828
His big brother gets killed, and the guys
who did it, they're still out there.

17:06.928 --> 17:09.330
Well, I can't do anything about that.

17:09.431 --> 17:10.598
But what if you could?

17:11.844 --> 17:13.800
Would you?

17:17.638 --> 17:20.650
Of course I would. Who wouldn't?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.907
You know, with my little girl,
it was just like you.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.391
They told me I couldn't
do anything, to wait.

17:31.186 --> 17:33.196
So I waited.

17:35.957 --> 17:37.968
And nothing happened.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.103
Come on.

17:48.503 --> 17:50.004
What?

17:50.506 --> 17:53.375
Trust me. Justin's asleep
in his bed. He's safe.

17:54.483 --> 17:56.376
Let's go for a ride.
I want to show you something.

18:04.854 --> 18:06.953
It's over there, right?

18:09.423 --> 18:12.262
That's where Stephon was...

18:12.728 --> 18:15.931
And they got another dealer
out there just like that.

18:16.031 --> 18:18.730
He's got to be working for somebody.

18:19.735 --> 18:23.472
Denzel's on the trail
of a kidnapper in this one.

18:23.572 --> 18:25.240
I got my own movie to go to.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.243
- Who are these friends?
- You met them before.

18:28.543 --> 18:31.947
- There's some I haven't met.
- And you're never gonna meet those.

18:32.147 --> 18:36.585
Yeah. They'd call this house day and night
when you were in eighth grade.

18:36.685 --> 18:40.188
Hi. Can I please speak to Stephon?

18:40.288 --> 18:43.559
So, what's up with you and that
neighbor Ben? The plumber man.

18:43.659 --> 18:44.926
All right. All righty.

18:45.126 --> 18:48.430
These friends you're meeting tonight,
is any of them your regular girl?

18:48.530 --> 18:50.549
Nah. They all know
who my regular girl is.

18:50.649 --> 18:53.969
Oh, please. I'm not falling for that one.
That's just so whack.

18:54.069 --> 18:55.737
Whack? You...

18:55.837 --> 18:58.223
- Whack.
- Please don't start using my words.

18:58.323 --> 19:01.727
- All right. Have fun. What time is it?
- Please. I'm 18. Come on.

19:01.827 --> 19:05.028
I don't care if your 18.
11:00, please, Stephon.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.784
- Peace, Just.
- See you, Stephon.

19:09.884 --> 19:14.456
- All right. You, me, and Denzel, baby.
- Yeah. Like always.

19:16.232 --> 19:19.258
Detective said he needs a name.

19:21.695 --> 19:23.272
Let's get one.

19:23.372 --> 19:26.168
- "Let's get one"? Let's go home.
- No.

19:26.268 --> 19:30.036
At the meeting, you started
to say what you wanted.

19:35.776 --> 19:39.512
I just want justice for the ones
who took my son.

19:41.148 --> 19:43.208
So let's get it.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.095
I just can't go over there and ask.
It's a street. It's crowded.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.364
You know what?

19:56.564 --> 19:59.239
Everyone goes home sometime.

20:13.114 --> 20:15.056
That's him.

20:17.218 --> 20:21.389
Hey. The twins ain't here.
I got the food. I'm coming home.

20:21.489 --> 20:24.157
What makes you think
he'll tell us anything?

20:25.960 --> 20:28.869
No. No. What if someone... We can't!

20:28.969 --> 20:31.750
We won't. Not unless we have to.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.302
If I want to eat my french fries
on the way home, I'm gonna.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.438
No. What are you gonna do?

20:37.456 --> 20:39.810
I guess I'll get my Tina on.

20:47.481 --> 20:48.984
Can I talk to you for a minute?

20:49.084 --> 20:52.420
Yo, yo. Don't come up
on nobody like that.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.456
I just got a question.

20:54.716 --> 20:57.259
- I know you?
- No, but you know Ray.

20:58.314 --> 21:01.246
What's it to you if I do?
What you want from me?

21:01.346 --> 21:02.931
A name.

21:03.031 --> 21:06.034
The corner that you work,
there was a drive-by last month.

21:06.134 --> 21:09.104
- Someone's responsible. That name.
- Look. Get the fuck out my face.

21:09.604 --> 21:10.737
I want a name!

21:13.307 --> 21:14.442
Is this a joke?

21:14.542 --> 21:17.179
I want a name! Give me that name
right now or I swear I'm gonna shoot...

21:22.015 --> 21:23.785
What did you do?

21:23.885 --> 21:26.788
What was I supposed to do?
You saw. He came right at me.

21:27.927 --> 21:29.422
He's somebody's child.

21:32.192 --> 21:35.597
He tried to kill us! Come on. Let's go.

21:35.697 --> 21:37.331
Go!

21:42.269 --> 21:45.507
- All we wanted was a name.
- But we did get one, didn't we?

21:45.607 --> 21:49.728
Donelle Peete. I mean,
it's not the right name, but it's a lead.

21:49.828 --> 21:52.948
And his phone.
His phone's gonna have more names.

21:53.048 --> 21:56.184
- We can leave a tip for that detective.
- He'll know my voice.

21:56.284 --> 21:59.037
He didn't know your face.
He won't know your voice.

21:59.137 --> 22:02.007
Look. I know you're
freaked out right now.

22:02.657 --> 22:04.978
But I know you feel lighter.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.271
Stephon.

22:22.543 --> 22:24.610
Wake up.

22:25.981 --> 22:28.250
Wake up.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.518
Don't leave me yet.

22:30.618 --> 22:35.023
You hear me? You don't leave me yet.
You don't leave your mama yet.

22:35.423 --> 22:37.057
Okay?

22:38.460 --> 22:40.547
Now wake up.

22:41.762 --> 22:44.179
You wake up, Stephon.

22:45.738 --> 22:47.535
You hear me?

22:47.635 --> 22:49.692
You hear me?

22:50.371 --> 22:52.132
Breathe.

22:55.143 --> 22:57.112
Wallet's gone, watch isn't.

22:58.393 --> 23:00.248
Rolex.

23:00.348 --> 23:01.549
The shooter left a Rolex?

23:01.649 --> 23:05.020
The dummy also left a pocketful of pills
containing a felonious substance.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.055
Felonious?

23:07.155 --> 23:10.725
I catch you with that big-word dictionary
again, I'm gonna beat you to death with it.

23:10.825 --> 23:14.596
- Where the hell's forensics?
- You know the drill. It's the ghetto.

23:14.696 --> 23:16.965
That means they get here
when they feel like it.

23:17.565 --> 23:22.137
Can't blame them. It's a simple ATM case.
Insert gun, pop, pop, pop, extract cash.

23:22.237 --> 23:26.974
He took a cellphone and left the drugs?
And no shell casings anywhere.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.310
- Got to be a revolver.
- No, I got it.

23:29.410 --> 23:33.514
It's the conductor of the symphony orchestra,
and he hid the casings in his opera cape.

23:33.614 --> 23:35.917
Smartass. Columbo got it done.

23:36.017 --> 23:39.454
- Yeah, Columbo's old as shit.
- No. That's what he wants you to think.

23:39.554 --> 23:41.723
So while you're busy making fun of him,
he's solving the crime.

23:42.023 --> 23:43.479
No, no, no. I get the whole theme of it,

23:43.579 --> 23:46.028
but I'll be the first one to tell you,
the shit don't hold up.

23:46.128 --> 23:50.899
Saw it on TV Land last night. Lots of guys
in plaid jackets and wide-ass ties.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.369
Is that what you do when you're not
on the job? TV Land?

23:54.469 --> 23:57.422
Don't act like you don't know.
You know the married life.

23:57.522 --> 24:00.089
Like a broken record.
Where the hell's forensics?

24:06.280 --> 24:08.717
I'm headed out to school.

24:09.417 --> 24:12.687
I know you're angry
about your brother. And I am, too.

24:12.787 --> 24:18.560
But, Justin, you will not ever put
your hand on a gun. You hear me?

24:18.660 --> 24:21.029
- I hear you. But...
- I want your word.

24:21.129 --> 24:23.398
It's like I told Stephon,
a man keeps his word.

24:23.498 --> 24:25.200
- You got it. But I don't know...
- Just go.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.544
And bring home lots of books in your
backpack because other than school,

24:27.644 --> 24:29.884
you won't be leaving home for awhile.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.022
Got to stay calm.

24:44.685 --> 24:46.187
What about the cash?

24:46.687 --> 24:49.490
I don't want to have anything
to do with it.

24:49.590 --> 24:50.792
Me neither.

24:52.063 --> 24:55.130
Maybe slip it in the donation box
at the meetings.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.766
I guess we shouldn't waste it.

24:58.866 --> 25:01.486
You don't have to worry.
There was nothing in the papers.

25:01.586 --> 25:04.955
- They're not looking for us, Lila.
- But the gun, it's still...

25:05.105 --> 25:07.442
I told you. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.275
I got it.

25:14.748 --> 25:17.219
Did you see who that call was from?

25:18.119 --> 25:20.822
- It was a text.
- What did it say?

25:20.922 --> 25:25.160
It said, "We said J.J.'s.
Usual time. Saturday. Leo".

25:25.460 --> 25:27.295
Well, that's from whoever he works for.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.365
So, if we go this Saturday at
the same time Donelle was there,

25:30.765 --> 25:33.799
we might find the one
who killed Stephon.

25:43.236 --> 25:44.810
Off.

25:48.115 --> 25:49.900
Shit.

25:52.853 --> 25:54.120
You have a moment, ma'am?

25:56.823 --> 25:59.092
Sorry. Do you have company?

25:59.392 --> 26:01.496
I just haven't picked up.

26:01.796 --> 26:03.731
Come on in.

26:03.831 --> 26:07.769
- Doing some work on the house?
- Yeah. "Get a hobby," they said.

26:08.169 --> 26:10.005
Assholes.

26:11.005 --> 26:14.709
Look. I won't keep you long. I just need
to take a look in Stephon's room.

26:14.809 --> 26:16.844
Standard procedure.

26:16.944 --> 26:18.978
Oh, come on. It's right in there.

26:21.582 --> 26:23.960
- Right here.
- Okay. Okay.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.606
Like I said, I usually pick up
better than this.

26:28.706 --> 26:32.760
It's okay. I was a teenager once.
Albeit, a long time ago.

26:34.629 --> 26:36.631
Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee?

26:37.131 --> 26:38.633
No, thanks. I'm fine.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.653
Well, I have something on the stove.
I'll be right back.

26:41.753 --> 26:43.475
Okay.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.416
Thank you, ma'am.

27:29.449 --> 27:32.420
You know, I saw he liked
to play Splinter Cell.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.622
I play that with my nephew sometimes.

27:34.722 --> 27:37.090
I just got it for him.
He never had a chance to play it.

27:39.859 --> 27:43.364
All right. Well... we'll be in touch
if there are any developments.

27:43.464 --> 27:47.869
What were you looking for? You said
it was about the corner and the rent?

27:48.169 --> 27:51.539
Well, there's certain
evidence-gathering protocol.

27:51.939 --> 27:55.644
- Like I said, procedure.
- That's it?

27:56.844 --> 27:59.447
You didn't come here to investigate
anything for real?

27:59.547 --> 28:02.750
You're just here to check off
a box by his name?

28:03.050 --> 28:06.221
No, ma'am. I treat every case
they give me the same.

28:06.321 --> 28:10.141
That's why I follow the same protocol.
Make sure nothing important gets missed.

28:10.241 --> 28:12.443
Next time, call first.

28:12.593 --> 28:15.394
Don't just show up to a person's house.

28:21.268 --> 28:23.938
I like that. "Call first".

28:24.238 --> 28:25.907
You got potential.

28:27.641 --> 28:29.710
Let's get to work.

28:50.997 --> 28:55.503
I always loved
home-design magazines and shows.

28:55.803 --> 28:58.606
That's something
I always wanted to do, but...

29:00.708 --> 29:02.543
I don't need more than one guess.

29:02.843 --> 29:05.780
First, I got pregnant.
Then he wanted to marry me.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.948
And by the time Stephon rolled around,
he didn't even know my name.

29:10.418 --> 29:12.854
Home design didn't even matter
after that. You know what I mean?

29:13.254 --> 29:14.522
Same type of thing happened to me.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.657
Except the first time he told me
he didn't want my baby,

29:16.757 --> 29:21.062
I told him to go fuck himself,
wasn't his anyway,

29:21.162 --> 29:22.395
then I went and had a pizza.

29:36.410 --> 29:39.413
- Hey, Ben.
- You feeling all right?

29:40.114 --> 29:43.851
Justin said this would be a good time
to come for my chairs.

29:43.951 --> 29:48.520
- Hungry? We got plenty.
- Are you sure? I've seen you eat.

29:49.557 --> 29:53.194
- Is it okay?
- Yeah. It's fine. I'll fix you a plate.

29:53.294 --> 29:55.093
All right, then.

29:56.096 --> 29:58.499
Justin, how you doing?

29:58.599 --> 30:03.004
- I've got an art project to work on.
- What? You just gonna leave?

30:03.104 --> 30:04.941
All right.

30:05.573 --> 30:07.391
Boy.

30:08.543 --> 30:11.446
This looks good, if I do say so.

30:11.546 --> 30:14.013
Well, I didn't make it.

30:15.501 --> 30:17.584
This is one of your dishes.

30:17.866 --> 30:20.381
My mother taught me this.

30:20.481 --> 30:24.409
Since it's just me, I don't usually
want to make a whole pot.

30:24.509 --> 30:29.030
Well, it's very nice of you.
I haven't felt much like cooking, so...

30:29.930 --> 30:31.208
Well...

30:31.308 --> 30:35.069
it looks like you've been pretty busy
working hard on this house.

30:35.169 --> 30:39.291
- Just let me know if you need a hand.
- I can manage just fine.

30:40.207 --> 30:42.808
I didn't mean anything, Lila.

30:46.046 --> 30:50.551
I'm sorry. My nerves
are just shot. I just...

30:50.651 --> 30:54.857
I'm gonna go back to group tomorrow.
I don't know what else to do.

30:56.157 --> 30:59.494
I don't know why things are like they are,
why people do what they do.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.898
All I know is, is you'll find your way.

31:04.498 --> 31:08.035
Till then, remember to eat.

31:08.135 --> 31:10.071
I'm gonna cut this...

31:10.171 --> 31:13.741
and give you a piece of this to eat.

31:14.699 --> 31:16.477
There.

31:16.577 --> 31:18.278
You got to eat.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.181
See? Feel better?

31:24.050 --> 31:27.754
Guess we finally had that dinner
I've been nagging you about.

31:28.389 --> 31:31.298
I kept asking 'cause...

31:31.398 --> 31:34.262
- maybe I shouldn't say.
- No, no. No, go ahead.

31:35.409 --> 31:37.997
I kept asking 'cause Stephon told me to.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.168
He said your thing with Denzel,
it wasn't gonna last.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.014
Thanks for that.

31:55.449 --> 31:57.252
Yeah.

31:57.752 --> 32:03.456
And for helping with Justin,
for everything, 'cause...

32:06.526 --> 32:09.061
I work out in the yard a lot.
They're kind of rough.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.601
No, they're not.

32:15.053 --> 32:17.171
Okay. Well, you take care.

32:18.338 --> 32:19.507
Okay.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.739
See you soon.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.502
Hey, Lila. Can I ask you something?
Now, did you find a sponsor?

32:31.602 --> 32:34.329
Patrice said she was interested.
But I have someone. Eve.

32:34.429 --> 32:36.724
That's okay. Look. Hey, Patrice?

32:36.824 --> 32:39.561
- Lila just wanted to let you know...
- Hey, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.

32:39.761 --> 32:41.696
I got to get home and get
to making my lemon squares.

32:41.796 --> 32:44.500
- What's your hurry, Patrice?
- Charles is coming home.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.336
He was coming home earlier,
but you know how boys are.

32:48.436 --> 32:51.873
Out there with his friends. So, I got
to get home, and I got to get ready.

32:52.273 --> 32:56.203
- Well, did you stop taking your medicine?
- Yeah. I didn't need it anymore.

32:56.303 --> 32:58.279
I found the answer.

32:58.379 --> 33:00.681
I found it right here in the bible.

33:01.781 --> 33:05.353
Who raised up his only son
in three days?

33:05.453 --> 33:07.655
That's what got me.

33:07.755 --> 33:12.193
'Cause if he could raise up his son,
he could raise up mine.

33:12.293 --> 33:14.362
So, that's when I started to pray.

33:15.302 --> 33:17.965
And I knew my prayer would be answered.

33:18.465 --> 33:20.466
Three days, three years.

33:23.036 --> 33:25.272
I got to let the others know.

33:26.658 --> 33:29.239
- Charles is coming home.
- Charles was...

33:29.339 --> 33:33.681
at a barbecue, and he was trying
to break up a fight, and he got killed

33:33.781 --> 33:38.453
three years ago today. Birthdays,
anniversaries, they're the worst.

33:39.653 --> 33:41.855
Patrice, do you think
you can stay for the meeting?

33:42.357 --> 33:44.692
This has happened to her before?

33:45.092 --> 33:48.793
Not just her. No, we all have
our bad times. So...

33:48.963 --> 33:52.428
we look in on each other, we...

33:52.528 --> 33:54.702
we stay over if we have to.

33:54.802 --> 33:56.704
So I'm gonna make sure
that she gets home tonight.

33:56.804 --> 33:59.740
And tomorrow, I will take her...

34:00.137 --> 34:02.475
If I lost it...

34:02.575 --> 34:04.649
would I even know it?

34:07.413 --> 34:09.917
Am I gonna end up just like her?

34:10.016 --> 34:12.233
If you stay inside

34:12.333 --> 34:16.728
and you keep it all in
like her, it festers.

34:18.826 --> 34:21.228
You got to do something
about your feelings.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.766
I try to sleep, but...

34:26.000 --> 34:30.603
My mind keeps going back
to that corner every time.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.282
You been thinking about this?

34:41.581 --> 34:44.085
I never stop thinking about it...

34:45.386 --> 34:48.786
About that damn diner
and who he was gonna see there.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.478
I want to see him,

34:54.728 --> 34:57.063
see if he's the one that took my son.

34:58.339 --> 34:59.700
It's Saturday.

35:01.237 --> 35:03.265
In two hours,

35:03.365 --> 35:05.697
it's the usual time.

35:06.807 --> 35:09.010
I think you have to go.

35:10.061 --> 35:12.780
It wouldn't just be for me.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.536
I need it just as much as you do.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.474
Then maybe we can help each other.

35:31.664 --> 35:34.323
I guess this is a stakeout.

35:35.035 --> 35:37.938
What do cops do during stakeouts?

35:38.038 --> 35:39.640
Sleep.

35:43.743 --> 35:46.178
In the movies, they talk
about their families.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.383
Is that my cue?

35:57.757 --> 36:00.640
My boyfriend's name is Mello.

36:01.228 --> 36:03.350
He comes from the land of JELL-O.

36:04.398 --> 36:07.618
<i>With pickles for his toes
and a cherry for his nose</i>

36:07.718 --> 36:10.371
<i>And that's the way my story goes</i>

36:10.471 --> 36:13.849
<i>My boyfriend's name is Billy
He come from good, old Philly</i>

36:13.949 --> 36:17.778
<i>With a cherry on his nose
And 10 big, fat toes,</i>

36:17.878 --> 36:19.860
<i>And that's the way my story goes</i>

36:19.960 --> 36:23.384
<i>I gave him back his peaches
I gave him back his pears</i>

36:23.484 --> 36:27.486
<i>I gave him back his 50 cents
And kicked him down the stairs</i>

36:31.759 --> 36:35.830
- So, your mom taught you that, too?
- Yeah.

36:37.145 --> 36:39.759
Your little girl used to do that?

36:41.167 --> 36:42.801
Yeah.

36:44.237 --> 36:47.807
I never told anyone,
but I always wanted a little girl.

36:59.452 --> 37:00.853
There they are.

37:10.530 --> 37:13.122
Think they killed anybody?

37:14.101 --> 37:17.669
- I think they killed Stephon.
- We don't know that.

37:20.039 --> 37:22.109
You know how I feel.

37:22.209 --> 37:24.211
We just talk to them.

37:24.311 --> 37:27.112
- Now, last time...
- Last time, you messed up.

37:28.848 --> 37:31.302
That's what I was gonna say, okay?

37:31.402 --> 37:34.739
Last time, I messed up.
So, this time, it's all you.

37:34.839 --> 37:37.708
If you want to go, we'll go. If you want
to talk to them, we'll talk to them.

37:37.808 --> 37:41.963
If we get a name for that cop,
I'll leave the tip. But it's all you.

37:42.763 --> 37:44.872
I'm going home.

37:52.539 --> 37:53.911
You think <i>they're</i> going home?

38:20.800 --> 38:23.170
Yeah! Hey, bro.

38:23.270 --> 38:25.639
I'm whupping the shit out
this motherfucking game, dawg.

38:25.739 --> 38:30.277
Ain't nobody fucking with me. I'm about
to get the last cherry and shit.

38:30.377 --> 38:35.115
Hey, I know he been talking to you, boy.
Shit. I'm the greatest, cuz.

38:35.415 --> 38:38.485
Got to level 180 on candy crush.
Beat that shit.

38:38.585 --> 38:41.253
I only see one of them.
Maybe the other one's in the car.

38:43.389 --> 38:46.995
Better call Saul, bitch.
Get the fuck over there.

38:48.695 --> 38:50.965
Hey, bro, I told you
we was being followed.

38:51.065 --> 38:53.021
Look at this shit.

38:53.121 --> 38:57.438
All right, bro. What you want,
a scooby snack or some shit, man?

38:57.538 --> 39:01.876
I'm just saying. You always trying to act
like I'm not paying attention and shit.

39:02.667 --> 39:04.578
Call it correct.

39:04.678 --> 39:08.549
We saw you at the diner.
Saw you following us and shit.

39:08.649 --> 39:10.684
You have fun?

39:10.784 --> 39:12.453
What the fuck do you want, man?

39:13.545 --> 39:17.121
I want to know who did the drive-by
on one of your corners.

39:18.592 --> 39:20.648
Oh, you do?

39:20.748 --> 39:24.064
Is that all? I mean, that's why
you came all the way down here for?

39:24.664 --> 39:28.904
Nah. Nah, you see?
There's something you ain't telling me.

39:30.004 --> 39:33.471
You know something
about who shot Donelle, bitch?

39:34.061 --> 39:35.943
Who's Donelle to you?

39:37.043 --> 39:40.778
- Answer the motherfucking question.
- You first.

39:51.157 --> 39:53.827
- Yo, yo.
- What the fuck is wrong with you, bro?

39:53.927 --> 39:55.563
Sorry.

39:55.663 --> 39:58.599
The Greek party was so sick, son.

39:58.899 --> 40:01.735
I had to make another run.
Who we got here?

40:01.835 --> 40:03.420
We got a fucking procedure, Bradley.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.619
I told you don't be rolling up
all quick like that.

40:05.719 --> 40:08.509
Chill, man. Why you always sweating me?
All the business I bring you.

40:08.809 --> 40:10.711
Dude, I bring you
all the campus green, son.

40:10.811 --> 40:12.862
You keep plenty for yourself.

40:12.962 --> 40:15.416
Oh, shit! No, no, no, no!

40:15.516 --> 40:17.162
Give it to me. Let's go.

40:17.262 --> 40:20.110
No! No! Let's ask. Let's ask.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.488
You got it. But hurry.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.457
Tell us what we want to know,
and your brother gets a doctor.

40:23.557 --> 40:27.961
- Fuck you. Get him one right now.
- Donelle's corner. The drive-by. That name.

40:28.061 --> 40:29.663
- Was it you, or was it him?
- Don't say, shit, man.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.598
Better say something or you're
gonna hear his last breath.

40:31.698 --> 40:36.270
- It's a sound you never stop hearing.
- Fuck! All right! It was Alonzo T.

40:36.370 --> 40:39.206
He runs the south side
for Handro and them.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.072
Teo!

40:44.244 --> 40:46.294
Fucking bitch.

40:56.289 --> 40:59.783
Come on. We got to go if we're
gonna make it. Let's go!

41:04.830 --> 41:08.769
You know, maybe you found the serenity
to accept the things you cannot change,

41:08.869 --> 41:12.873
and maybe you gained the courage
to change the things you can.

41:12.973 --> 41:16.943
But finding the wisdom
to know the difference

41:17.043 --> 41:22.182
is the real challenge because the grief
of your loss can be so debilitating,

41:22.282 --> 41:25.650
it can cloud your judgment.

41:33.976 --> 41:35.596
That goes for the Olsen twins.

41:35.696 --> 41:40.034
Ashley here has no wallet, no cash,
no cellphone. Unlike Mary-Kate, here.

41:40.134 --> 41:44.069
And what should we call the one
down here? Humpty Dumpty? Opie?

41:46.406 --> 41:48.939
I'm gonna ask for overtime. If they're
gonna task us and keep sending us out,

41:49.039 --> 41:51.628
- I mean, that's unfair.
- They didn't send us.

41:52.078 --> 41:54.948
I heard it was a revolver.
Something about it.

41:55.048 --> 41:58.018
- I called in and asked for it.
- I knew it. I knew it.

41:58.118 --> 42:00.219
What are you doing?
You volunteering us now?

42:00.319 --> 42:03.324
That's not procedure. Since when
have you stopped following procedure?

42:03.424 --> 42:06.623
Revolver again, no cellphone again.

42:06.723 --> 42:08.862
- Kid have any drugs on him?
- Yeah.

42:08.962 --> 42:12.333
Enough to make it the best fucking
prom ever. So what?

42:12.933 --> 42:15.602
Ballistics comes back, it's gonna be
the same shooter as Donelle.

42:15.702 --> 42:17.530
- We're gonna be ready.
- They won't give a shit upstairs.

42:17.630 --> 42:20.941
Our task force is not gonna get
another task for these motherfuckers.

42:21.341 --> 42:24.611
A series of related shootings.
They're gonna give a shit.

42:24.711 --> 42:28.346
Yeah. Of course they will.
Somebody just killed Opie.

42:33.352 --> 42:35.787
- Justin?
- Yeah?

42:36.922 --> 42:39.657
- Justin?
- I'm in the bedroom.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.068
What do you...
what do you think you're doing?

42:48.768 --> 42:51.205
- I cleared out his stuff.
- Where... where is everything?

42:51.305 --> 42:53.774
- In the attic.
- Who said you could do this?

42:53.874 --> 42:57.945
- This is my room. And I can't...
- No. No. This is my house.

42:58.445 --> 43:02.529
All right? So you bring it all
back now. Now!

43:02.629 --> 43:06.629
No! I can't look at his stuff
every day! I'm sick of it!

43:06.729 --> 43:09.390
He is not coming back, mom! He's...

43:21.734 --> 43:24.071
<i>Lila, I'll send him home if you want.</i>

43:24.171 --> 43:26.704
<i>But he wants to stay on my couch.</i>

43:29.875 --> 43:32.879
All right... tell him...

43:32.979 --> 43:35.575
Tell him all right, and...

43:36.370 --> 43:37.897
tell him I'm sorry.

43:45.458 --> 43:49.694
Here I am, hurting over memories,
and he's having to look at it every night.

43:50.964 --> 43:53.367
Look... don't blame yourself too much.

43:53.667 --> 43:56.670
It was like he was trying to put
his brother away for good.

43:56.770 --> 44:00.975
No. No. He kept Stephon's watch
as a reminder.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.942
You ever keep anything?

44:06.045 --> 44:07.989
Of course.

44:09.983 --> 44:12.320
I kept some clothes,

44:13.864 --> 44:16.238
some pictures.

44:18.157 --> 44:20.961
- And on my phone, I...
- I know what you're gonna say.

44:21.261 --> 44:23.714
I know what you're gonna say
'cause I do the same thing.

44:23.814 --> 44:26.181
I even paid the bill so I could.

44:28.134 --> 44:30.902
<i>Yo, it's Stephon. You know what to do.</i>

44:31.772 --> 44:35.806
Hear how he's trying to be cool?
Yo, it's Stephon. You know what to do.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.910
It sounds to me like
he's trying to tell us something.

44:44.950 --> 44:48.751
- We already have a name.
- Exactly.

44:52.191 --> 44:55.534
And I know to find him.

45:28.561 --> 45:29.981
Look what they did!

45:40.573 --> 45:42.107
You don't think I know who you are?

45:43.742 --> 45:48.213
You think you can just show up
like no one would know?

45:50.949 --> 45:52.286
We said no reporters.

45:53.696 --> 45:55.622
I'm not a reporter.

45:55.772 --> 45:57.658
Then who are you?

45:59.658 --> 46:02.746
I'm from a grief support group
for mothers.

46:02.846 --> 46:04.602
And...

46:06.433 --> 46:10.537
I just wanted to leave
a card, just in case.

46:14.907 --> 46:16.575
Thank you.

46:21.831 --> 46:24.241
The family wanted to send along
a thank-you card,

46:24.341 --> 46:28.987
and he didn't leave an address
so we decided to call the florist.

46:31.690 --> 46:35.391
Alonzo, yes. Business address is fine.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.065
Promiseland Atlanta?

46:38.665 --> 46:40.469
What's that?

46:41.668 --> 46:43.637
Oh, a night club.

46:43.737 --> 46:45.403
Okay.

46:47.873 --> 46:50.110
We're going to a night club.

46:51.476 --> 46:55.649
It's been so long.
I almost forgot how to do this.

46:55.749 --> 46:58.385
You're stepping out.
Might as well step out in style.

46:58.485 --> 47:00.551
What do you think?

47:01.520 --> 47:03.554
You look good!

47:04.057 --> 47:06.026
- Almost as good as me.
- Almost is good enough

47:06.126 --> 47:07.861
'cause I don't want to look
like no hoochie.

47:07.961 --> 47:10.035
Really? It's like that?

47:10.597 --> 47:13.799
- Your hair looks good.
- You like it? Really?

47:14.301 --> 47:18.004
Chopped it myself.
Used to be down to my ass, but...

47:18.104 --> 47:21.575
After my girl passed, I just took
a scissor to it. Now I kind of like it.

47:21.675 --> 47:23.476
Looks good.

47:24.076 --> 47:26.079
- All right. Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

47:26.179 --> 47:28.214
All right. Ready?

47:37.557 --> 47:40.319
- That's a good one. Do another one.
- Okay, okay.

47:40.419 --> 47:42.360
- Different pose.
- Hold on. Okay.

48:23.102 --> 48:25.772
How do we know if Alonzo's even here?

48:25.872 --> 48:29.208
We don't. You got Teo's phone?

48:32.778 --> 48:35.346
Alonzo isn't on here.

48:36.815 --> 48:38.483
But there's a Zo.

48:48.493 --> 48:51.565
<i>Yo. Who's calling me on Teo's phone?</i>

48:52.516 --> 48:53.967
<i>Hello?</i>

48:54.467 --> 48:56.436
That song.

48:56.536 --> 48:58.838
You're in my club.

48:58.938 --> 49:00.206
The fuck?

49:43.132 --> 49:47.153
- Looks like they're leaving.
- No. No, not tonight. Look at her.

49:48.167 --> 49:52.058
Lila, don't worry. I got this covered.

49:52.558 --> 49:54.392
Trust me.

49:58.063 --> 50:02.600
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

50:06.138 --> 50:09.376
- God. How far along are you?
- Oh, six months.

50:09.476 --> 50:14.347
Six months? You know what I remember
about being six months pregnant?

50:14.847 --> 50:16.931
I wanted it all the time.

50:17.617 --> 50:19.662
My hormones are jumping.

50:20.185 --> 50:22.520
- Nope. Don't Bend. Do not Bend.
- We got you covered.

50:26.726 --> 50:29.829
- Did you ever go out to dinner...
- I know what you're gonna say.

50:29.929 --> 50:33.099
Before I even opened the menu,
I would be dragging him back home.

50:33.199 --> 50:36.036
- Where do you think I'm going now?
- I know what you're gonna say.

50:36.136 --> 50:37.837
You look great.

50:37.937 --> 50:42.607
I know. I know you got responsibilities,
but you can take a night off.

50:43.477 --> 50:45.945
Where am I? I'm at your place.

50:46.243 --> 50:50.116
- That is such a typical answer.
- It's such a typical question.

50:51.116 --> 50:53.419
Have you thought about a name
for the baby yet?

50:53.519 --> 50:56.908
No. 'Cause when the time come,

50:57.008 --> 51:00.593
you gonna look up at me, and I'm gonna
just go with whatever name you say.

51:05.797 --> 51:07.832
What about you?

51:08.501 --> 51:10.136
Of course I have.

51:10.236 --> 51:13.373
Y'all be obsessing over that shit.

51:13.473 --> 51:17.508
Ain't like... ain't like it matter
what I think no way.

51:21.482 --> 51:25.017
I want to name the baby Worthington.

51:25.517 --> 51:29.055
You hear me? Baby, come on, now.
Stop ignoring me.

51:29.455 --> 51:32.026
Baby, come on, now. That was funny.

51:33.626 --> 51:34.859
Ba...

51:37.295 --> 51:38.598
Hey, what's this all about?

51:38.898 --> 51:42.536
Just another drive-by,
just another two people dead.

51:43.136 --> 51:45.405
- One named Ray.
- And one named Stephon.

51:45.505 --> 51:48.041
Stephon was my son, and...

51:48.141 --> 51:50.844
I want the one responsible.
It was you, Leo said.

51:50.944 --> 51:52.675
Leo?

51:53.413 --> 51:54.993
Teo and Donelle? That was you?

51:55.093 --> 51:57.167
I'm the one asking the questions.
I want to know.

51:57.267 --> 51:59.819
Fuck what you want to know, bitch.

51:59.919 --> 52:02.322
You come up in here a... fuck you.

52:02.422 --> 52:04.724
- Did you kill my son? Tell me.
- I ain't telling you shit.

52:04.824 --> 52:08.181
- Tell me what I want to know.
- Maybe I got something I can tell you.

52:08.281 --> 52:10.367
Maybe I can make it over there
and snap your fucking neck

52:10.467 --> 52:12.716
- before you pull the trigger.
- Maybe I'll ask Maya.

52:12.816 --> 52:17.470
Remember Maya? Yeah.
Didn't even cross your selfish-ass mind?

52:19.155 --> 52:20.223
Where is she?

52:20.323 --> 52:23.476
- She's in the closet. She's fine.
- She's carrying my baby.

52:23.576 --> 52:26.179
You killed my baby.
You think I fucking care about yours?

52:26.579 --> 52:31.085
- Oh, you not getting out of here alive.
- You think I care about getting out alive?

52:32.185 --> 52:33.858
All right.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.977
You want to hear?

52:36.489 --> 52:37.622
I'll tell you.

52:40.926 --> 52:44.430
Ray was working one of my corners
without doing what was right.

52:44.530 --> 52:47.901
So, told Teo and Leo to go
tell him what was what,

52:48.001 --> 52:49.803
but they ain't never get around to it.

52:49.953 --> 52:53.757
Then Donelle sends me word that...
Ray's out there dissing me.

52:54.307 --> 52:58.378
I was in the neighborhood.
I decided I'd take care of it myself.

52:59.523 --> 53:01.546
<i>I warned the motherfucker.</i>

53:05.167 --> 53:07.103
Everything's gonna be all good.
You know?

53:07.653 --> 53:10.657
Tell her to chill.
Stephon's gonna be there.

53:11.257 --> 53:14.792
But you start letting shit go,
pretty soon it will all be gone.

53:18.196 --> 53:20.834
I wasn't exactly looking for your son,

53:21.234 --> 53:23.227
<i>but he was there.</i>

53:23.603 --> 53:25.436
<i>He's right there.</i>

53:28.307 --> 53:31.410
So you ask me who's responsible
for that shit on the corner...

53:33.813 --> 53:35.349
- It's you.
- What are you...

53:35.449 --> 53:38.318
- You motherf...
- You let him run the streets.

53:38.418 --> 53:40.820
- He shouldn't have been there.
- Shoot him.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.984
He got in the way. That shit's
gonna happen when you somewhere

53:43.084 --> 53:45.592
- you ain't supposed to be.
- Finish him right now.

53:45.692 --> 53:50.780
So, it's you, it's me, it's... it's my man
Handro in Mayfield. It's the world.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.767
Same shit's gonna happen tomorrow.
World's gonna keep on turning.

53:53.867 --> 53:55.338
Do you think you can stop it?

53:58.338 --> 54:00.366
Man, who are you?

54:00.466 --> 54:01.906
I'm just a mother.

54:09.915 --> 54:12.416
Are you okay? Come on.

54:21.895 --> 54:24.428
Let's go. No! Let's go.

54:31.670 --> 54:34.107
It's terrible. That poor girl.

54:34.207 --> 54:36.075
Poor girl?

54:37.033 --> 54:39.112
She knew how he got his money.
And she knew what he did to get it,

54:39.212 --> 54:40.413
and she fucked him anyway.

54:40.513 --> 54:42.799
- Fucked him because of it, probably.
- She didn't deserve to get shot.

54:42.899 --> 54:44.934
<i>We</i> didn't shoot her!

54:45.084 --> 54:47.420
And that shit's gonna happen
if you're where you shouldn't be.

54:47.520 --> 54:50.056
Isn't that what Zo said?
Fucking asshole.

54:50.156 --> 54:53.626
- You wanted justice, you got it.
- I don't feel better.

54:54.126 --> 54:56.593
That's because it's not over.

54:57.829 --> 55:00.166
Alonzo said his man in Mayfield
was the one who ordered that hit.

55:00.266 --> 55:03.569
- I don't care about the man in Mayfield.
- Well, you have to.

55:03.669 --> 55:06.239
Because it's all connected.

55:06.639 --> 55:11.138
- You don't see that?
- No. No, I don't see.

55:12.778 --> 55:15.181
I'm sorry, Eve, but I'm done.

55:16.227 --> 55:18.819
This wasn't just about you, remember?

55:19.519 --> 55:21.552
We were supposed to be helping
each other here.

55:24.322 --> 55:28.027
What? So, what? Now we just go back
to our lives like nothing ever happened?

55:28.127 --> 55:30.830
After all we've been through
and all that we've done,

55:31.230 --> 55:34.097
you really think that we can go back?

55:36.368 --> 55:39.510
I went into the closet to change.

55:40.310 --> 55:42.242
Someone grabbed me from behind.

55:42.342 --> 55:47.113
And I heard a voice real low
said I'd be dead if I made one sound.

55:47.213 --> 55:51.351
- Can you give us any description?
- I didn't see. I didn't want to see.

55:51.501 --> 55:53.686
All I can say...

55:53.786 --> 55:57.455
- is that she sounded real mad.
- She? Did you say she?

55:59.924 --> 56:03.204
Only a few crews got women running
with them. Someone's moving in.

56:03.304 --> 56:05.531
I'm telling you. All we got to do now
is start running names, records.

56:05.631 --> 56:07.467
What are you talking...
this isn't a turf war.

56:07.567 --> 56:09.536
"She sounded real mad".
That ain't turf. It's personal.

56:09.636 --> 56:12.438
You always say, "Work the evidence".
So where you getting that?

56:12.538 --> 56:14.537
Call it a working theory.

56:23.115 --> 56:26.788
- What's this all about?
- We're having a little outing.

56:33.058 --> 56:34.994
Well, this is a really good idea.

56:35.294 --> 56:37.463
Well, I am so glad
that you're enjoying it.

56:38.063 --> 56:41.567
Yeah. And I know someone else
who would, too.

56:44.870 --> 56:46.637
Excuse me.

56:47.672 --> 56:49.392
All right, I know
you're still mad at me...

56:49.492 --> 56:52.428
But some of us from the group
are out to dinner.

56:52.528 --> 56:56.015
- And going to a movie, too.
- Dinner and a movie.

56:56.115 --> 56:59.752
I know it's not your thing,
but I thought I'd just let you know.

56:59.852 --> 57:01.920
So, holla back.

57:03.621 --> 57:05.088
"Holla back?"

57:05.925 --> 57:10.647
- Well, I know y'all still say that.
- No. No.

57:11.264 --> 57:13.666
Lila, was that your friend Eve?

57:13.967 --> 57:17.637
- Any luck with getting her to come back?
- I tried, but you know how she is.

57:17.737 --> 57:20.640
I've heard you mention her,
but I must have missed meeting her.

57:20.740 --> 57:23.808
- Is she that new woman from Decatur?
- No. She lives in Midtown.

57:26.311 --> 57:28.381
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

57:29.378 --> 57:34.087
I know we're here to celebrate
getting this lovely lady out of the house.

57:34.187 --> 57:37.690
But I also want to make a toast
to her son, Mr. Justin,

57:38.290 --> 57:40.259
the award-winning artiste.

57:41.527 --> 57:45.331
Award? Wait a minute.
Award-winning? What award?

57:46.131 --> 57:48.100
Nothing. It's just a school thing.

57:48.200 --> 57:51.637
- My art project won a contest.
- Why didn't you tell her?

57:51.737 --> 57:54.457
I couldn't. I mean,
I couldn't find the time to.

57:54.557 --> 57:56.669
What do you mean, you couldn't find
the time to? You could just say it.

57:56.769 --> 58:00.780
- How hard is that?
- Real hard lately. I never see you.

58:00.880 --> 58:03.514
You're either working
on the house or with them.

58:05.383 --> 58:07.787
So, when you get home...

58:07.887 --> 58:10.256
I'd like to see it, please.

58:10.356 --> 58:12.089
Show your mama.

58:16.457 --> 58:18.829
I wasn't sure how you'd feel.

58:21.233 --> 58:22.366
Do you like it?

58:30.174 --> 58:32.223
I love it.

58:38.582 --> 58:40.451
I love you.

58:42.120 --> 58:45.392
- I love you, too, mom.
- I love you so much.

58:57.570 --> 58:59.305
Hey.

58:59.405 --> 59:02.547
The mailman left me some of yours.

59:02.647 --> 59:04.909
I had nothing to...

59:16.788 --> 59:19.025
Got the forensics. No prints.

59:20.115 --> 59:22.564
Zo's phone was gone. I got the records.

59:22.664 --> 59:25.097
Guess who his last call ever was from?

59:25.197 --> 59:26.332
Teo Corlone.

59:26.432 --> 59:29.368
Teo's got a pretty good alibi,
what with being dead and all.

59:29.468 --> 59:32.304
So, the shooter has Zo's phone,
Teo, and Donelle...

59:32.404 --> 59:35.639
- What are you doing? Don't touch my shit.
- Yeah, you better put on your jacket.

59:39.107 --> 59:41.814
You finally got a case big enough
to get you face time upstairs?

59:41.914 --> 59:44.517
Pretty-boy college kid
getting killed got his attention.

59:45.017 --> 59:47.053
What's the latest
with the Bradley Tipton case?

59:47.253 --> 59:49.923
Well, we do know it's the
same gun for all the shootings.

59:50.023 --> 59:51.824
Phone records link them all.

59:51.924 --> 59:54.393
Alonzo to Leo, Alonzo to Teo,

59:54.493 --> 59:57.763
- Leo and Teo to Donelle, Donelle...
- All the varied permutations.

59:58.263 --> 01:00:00.233
He's been waiting to use that $10 word.

01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:03.936
Like I was saying, they all worked
together, now they're all dead.

01:00:04.436 --> 01:00:07.472
The Alejandro organization supplies
the neighborhood, but...

01:00:07.572 --> 01:00:10.976
but these guys, they're local.
It all points to a turf war.

01:00:11.076 --> 01:00:14.313
What? No. The physical evidence doesn't,
the crime scenes sure don't.

01:00:14.413 --> 01:00:17.116
I don't know what else it could be.
And I got the D.A. calling me.

01:00:17.216 --> 01:00:20.103
I got the press up my ass. What would you
have me tell them, Holliston?

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:22.295
You can tell them no comment.
It's still under investigation.

01:00:22.395 --> 01:00:25.392
That your heart goes out
to the families.

01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:29.695
Turf war's our working theory.
Help me out, Scaketti.

01:00:29.795 --> 01:00:33.766
I got it narrowed down to two crews...
Quincy Corners and 16th street.

01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:36.001
They're the ones who've had
women running with them.

01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:39.470
Okay. That's good. Keep me informed.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.744
Inform me on how your theories
fit the details.

01:00:45.444 --> 01:00:47.179
Say, with the wild shooting.

01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:50.316
And with taking the phone and leaving
the drugs and leaving a fucking witness.

01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:52.201
- You got a better fucking theory?
- Yeah.

01:00:52.301 --> 01:00:54.587
Somebody's trying to climb up the ladder,
but not for reasons you think.

01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:57.042
Let's try climbing back down.

01:00:58.323 --> 01:01:00.026
It's Alonzo's neighborhood, right?

01:01:00.726 --> 01:01:05.064
He gives a franchise to Leo and Teo.
Bradley, not-so-innocent bystander.

01:01:06.364 --> 01:01:09.068
Leo and Teo bring on Donelle,
who replaces Ray.

01:01:09.168 --> 01:01:11.637
And Stephon, wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:01:13.265 --> 01:01:15.608
And it's a woman.

01:01:15.708 --> 01:01:17.587
So, what woman?

01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:21.041
Jesus Christ.

01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.567
- Oh, shit.
- Holliston, yo.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.919
You heard what the chief said just now.

01:01:27.019 --> 01:01:29.465
Turf war's our working theory.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:31.155
Go home, man.

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:37.596
So, don't forget that we have
that fundraiser for tomorrow.

01:01:37.696 --> 01:01:42.193
And if I can get a couple volunteers
to maybe make some lemon squares

01:01:42.293 --> 01:01:45.571
- or some muffins...
- Muffins.

01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:49.575
Thank you. It'd be great.
Thank you, guys. Hi, Lila.

01:01:49.675 --> 01:01:52.812
And... I think I see a new face.

01:01:52.912 --> 01:01:55.848
- Was it Nita?
- Welcome, Nita.

01:01:55.948 --> 01:01:58.716
You're welcome to share if you'd like.

01:02:06.658 --> 01:02:09.378
I lost...

01:02:09.478 --> 01:02:12.218
my two sons, Leo and Teo.

01:02:14.332 --> 01:02:17.571
They would tease each other,
but you could see the love.

01:02:19.571 --> 01:02:22.240
They would come and see me every Sunday.

01:02:22.942 --> 01:02:25.711
I'm just a cashier,
but they bought me a house.

01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:29.882
But they loved working with their hands.
They were in construction.

01:02:29.982 --> 01:02:31.749
They were dealers, the news said.

01:02:34.652 --> 01:02:36.322
We're here to support each other.

01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:39.625
Oh, we've suffered
too much to... to lie.

01:02:40.682 --> 01:02:42.261
You don't think I've suffered?

01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:44.630
Yeah.

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.634
Yeah, you've suffered. I...
You deserve our love and comfort.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.570
If you need any help, I'll be glad to...

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.542
I know we... we have rules and all.

01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:58.844
And I want to do the right thing, but...

01:02:58.944 --> 01:03:02.314
if you knew what your boys were into,

01:03:02.414 --> 01:03:04.617
if you took one dime from them, knowing,

01:03:04.717 --> 01:03:07.520
and you didn't do everything
you could to stop them...

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.666
Patrice.

01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:13.192
She may deserve comfort and support.

01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:14.894
She doesn't deserve it from us.

01:03:14.994 --> 01:03:18.386
- I'm sorry, but I agree with Patrice.
- No.

01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:24.487
She's a mother, too.
She's in pain just like us.

01:03:24.587 --> 01:03:26.437
I'm not sure we should judge.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.109
We shouldn't.

01:03:41.419 --> 01:03:43.125
Ms. Walcott...

01:03:43.225 --> 01:03:45.903
You got a few minutes?
Talk about the case?

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:50.761
- There's a place nearby... J.J.'s?
- Sure. I'll meet you there.

01:04:06.044 --> 01:04:08.748
Miguel Alejandro's crew
runs the whole south side.

01:04:09.348 --> 01:04:13.185
In your area, he had a guy
named Alonzo Troys running things.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.923
Alonzo leads to Leo and Teo.
They lead to Donelle.

01:04:18.323 --> 01:04:21.193
They all worked together,
and they're all dead.

01:04:21.293 --> 01:04:24.163
Bradley, the white frat boy,
he's just big into dealing on campus.

01:04:24.263 --> 01:04:26.599
We think it was a wrong place,
wrong time situation.

01:04:26.699 --> 01:04:29.166
That's been known to happen.

01:04:31.002 --> 01:04:34.006
Anyway, Donelle takes over for Ray.

01:04:34.973 --> 01:04:39.442
So it all leads back to the corner
where Stephon was killed.

01:04:41.646 --> 01:04:44.476
Now, there's something I got to ask.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.817
Did Stephon know these guys?

01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:50.840
Who the hell you think you are,
asking me that?

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.376
Bringing me here to ask me that?

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:56.129
That white cheerleader you got
posted up on your board and Bradley...

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:59.924
you ask their mothers that?
Or just ones like me?

01:05:00.715 --> 01:05:02.885
He never knew them, never met them,
never had one thing to do with them

01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:05.454
till the day they murdered him.

01:05:05.554 --> 01:05:06.872
I'm just trying to make sense of it.

01:05:06.972 --> 01:05:09.975
You have no idea what it's like
to lose a child. No idea.

01:05:10.734 --> 01:05:12.877
I'm afraid I do.

01:05:17.949 --> 01:05:20.117
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:23.054 --> 01:05:26.125
Well, if you have nothing else
to tell me, I'm gonna go home.

01:05:26.925 --> 01:05:29.721
But, you know, there is one other thing.

01:05:32.507 --> 01:05:35.635
Alonzo's girl, Maya,

01:05:36.635 --> 01:05:40.274
she... identified the shooter
as a woman.

01:05:41.374 --> 01:05:42.942
Said she sounded real mad.

01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:46.743
No one's gonna believe that.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:52.918
So, what's gonna happen to the case now?

01:05:53.218 --> 01:05:55.452
If it stops now, nothing, probably.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:02.497
If it happens again,
I'm gonna find the one responsible.

01:06:03.228 --> 01:06:05.172
I'm gonna have to.

01:06:05.272 --> 01:06:06.765
Leave more than that.

01:06:08.015 --> 01:06:09.668
What? It's 15%.

01:06:09.768 --> 01:06:12.705
We took up a booth. You ever think
about what women go through?

01:06:13.405 --> 01:06:16.607
Yeah. Quite a bit lately.

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:42.902
- You're under arrest.
- That's not funny. Put it away!

01:06:44.644 --> 01:06:46.277
It's kind of funny.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:49.508
I wanted to see how you'd feel
if I didn't show.

01:06:49.608 --> 01:06:50.776
You were so scared.

01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:52.945
Hell, yeah, I was scared.
That detective knows.

01:06:53.045 --> 01:06:54.705
That man don't know shit.

01:06:54.805 --> 01:06:57.716
What you need to be worried about
is our man in Mayfield, Alonzo's boss.

01:06:57.816 --> 01:07:02.221
- It's time for me and Justin to move away.
- Oh, Jesus. You with the running.

01:07:02.521 --> 01:07:05.824
I need to think about Justin, and the girls
in the support group will understand.

01:07:05.924 --> 01:07:08.928
The girls in the group
don't give a fuck about you.

01:07:10.028 --> 01:07:11.795
I do.

01:07:13.231 --> 01:07:15.234
You want to run away?

01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:17.002
Fine.

01:07:17.352 --> 01:07:19.788
But we got to finish what we started

01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:22.806
or they're gonna finish us.

01:07:33.918 --> 01:07:36.956
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

01:07:37.456 --> 01:07:40.659
You know, I think that once
we finish the renovation, that...

01:07:41.363 --> 01:07:42.961
we're gonna move.

01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:45.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:45.497 --> 01:07:49.666
- I think it's something we've got to do.
- I understand.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.528
What about Ben?

01:07:55.628 --> 01:07:57.810
That's a good question.

01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:01.244
- I like him.
- I like him, too.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.832
Stay down!

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.136
Justin?

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:31.541
Somebody call an ambulance!

01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:38.649
Are you all right?

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:59.538
Oh, Justin. Justin.

01:09:00.339 --> 01:09:02.573
Oh, Justin.

01:09:02.674 --> 01:09:04.777
Justin.

01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:06.645
- Justin.
- Here, ma'am. Back here.

01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:08.612
Justin.

01:09:11.183 --> 01:09:13.049
Hey, Mom.

01:09:15.053 --> 01:09:17.221
Ms. Walcott? About your son.

01:09:17.322 --> 01:09:19.625
He's got a broken kneecap,
but he's gonna be just fine.

01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:21.160
Okay. Okay.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.078
- What's up, big man?
- Hey.

01:09:23.178 --> 01:09:26.098
- What'd I tell you about driving?
- Thanks for coming.

01:09:26.898 --> 01:09:30.502
Come on, now. No need for that.

01:09:30.603 --> 01:09:32.104
Let me get you and Justin home.

01:09:32.203 --> 01:09:36.081
You both can stay with me
until you can get things straight.

01:09:36.908 --> 01:09:39.444
Justin, you good?

01:09:39.644 --> 01:09:41.580
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.457
We gonna get you out of here,
get you home.

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:47.886
One child dead, and...

01:09:47.986 --> 01:09:49.388
and then he threatens the other child.

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:52.756
I mean, everyone's children,
really. Really.

01:09:54.759 --> 01:09:58.799
I am not going back to feeling helpless.

01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:05.200
You know how you told me
you always like to...

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.540
clean house whenever
something bad happens?

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.412
- Your way of making it better, right?
- Yeah. Being in control. Yeah.

01:10:13.812 --> 01:10:16.349
Well, let's finish the house...

01:10:17.049 --> 01:10:20.017
in a way that will finish off Alejandro.

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.319
Okay. Where do we begin?

01:11:13.038 --> 01:11:14.667
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:17.556
<i>The trap is set. Cheese is in place.</i>

01:11:17.656 --> 01:11:21.443
<i>All we need is the rat.
Pick me up tonight.</i>

01:11:37.161 --> 01:11:39.697
You got Patrice's ride?

01:11:42.066 --> 01:11:44.386
I got the address...

01:11:44.486 --> 01:11:46.212
maps...

01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:49.074
- everything.
- Where'd you get this?

01:11:49.574 --> 01:11:52.544
- You know where I got it.
- You were in my office?

01:11:52.744 --> 01:11:55.480
Duh. It's the office of public records.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.750
- Did someone help you?
- No, I did it myself. It was easy.

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:01.617
I mean, the computer did
most of the work, but...

01:12:01.919 --> 01:12:04.354
Come on. We got to go.

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:09.741
2121 Dogwood.

01:12:18.052 --> 01:12:20.939
I want you to look down at Alejandro's
house and tell me what you see.

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:23.909
A party.

01:12:24.309 --> 01:12:27.212
Alejandro's out there,
and we're over here, and...

01:12:27.312 --> 01:12:30.515
he doesn't even think
about what he does to us.

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:34.953
And that's what I mean. It's not you.

01:12:35.053 --> 01:12:37.821
It's the world that's lost its mind.

01:13:02.442 --> 01:13:05.028
Who the fuck calls me on Zo's cell?

01:13:06.798 --> 01:13:09.868
- Who is this?
- Your friends already told you.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:13.415
I met a few of them the other day
when I was taking my son to school.

01:13:13.615 --> 01:13:17.407
What do you expect?
You fuck with my people.

01:13:17.507 --> 01:13:21.478
<i>And now you come here,
and you fuck with my family?</i>

01:13:21.878 --> 01:13:24.373
I'm gonna fucking kill you myself...

01:13:24.573 --> 01:13:26.919
<i>and your family.</i>

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.478
You watch.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.153
It's gonna go down tomorrow.

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:40.783
Wait, what are you gonna do
with the gun and the phone?

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.552
I'll take care of everything.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.442
How are you, Mr. Homemaker?

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.345
I'm good, now that you're back.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.280
Patrice called.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.650
The girls want to come
to see you and Justin.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.254
Maybe in a few days, just so we can
get our act together, you know?

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:20.189
Okay.

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:23.626
So, are we gonna meet
Miss Eve this time?

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.430
We've met everyone but your sponsor.
What's up with that?

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.065
Oh, what's up with that? You know what?

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:33.035
Let me introduce you to her
'cause everyone wants to meet Miss Eve.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.671
Everybody wants to meet Miss Eve.

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:38.476
- Here she goes.
- All right.

01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:45.257
Girl, you looking good.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.660
That's weird.

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:52.989
No worries, I'll just meet her when
she comes up to visit with the other girls.

01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:56.263
Are you coming to bed?

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.134
<i>Almost as good as me.</i>

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.636
Almost is good enough 'cause
I don't want to look like no hoochie.

01:15:08.325 --> 01:15:09.839
It's like that?

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:13.009
No, take one more.
I like that one, though.

01:15:13.745 --> 01:15:14.647
Hoochie?

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.984
<i>You want the ones responsible.</i>

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.893
<i>Lila, was that your friend Eve?</i>

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.995
<i>I heard you mention it, but...</i>

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:36.415
I must have missed meeting her.
Is she that new woman from Decatur?

01:15:36.515 --> 01:15:37.984
No, she lives in midtown.

01:15:38.184 --> 01:15:43.172
When that child is murdered,
we feel guilt, depression.

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:46.075
We lose our homes, our minds.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:48.744
- Charles is coming home.
- This has happened to her before?

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.764
We all have our hard times.

01:15:51.864 --> 01:15:55.751
- <i>If I lost it, would I even know it?</i>
- <i>Get some paint.</i>

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:59.588
- Answer the motherfucking question.
- You first.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.590
If she's not real, then...

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.893
I'll take care of everything.

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:08.463
The leather bag will be with me.
It will be with me, it will be...

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.811
it will be in the car.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:18.320
<i>Maybe he just wanted to protect you.</i>

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:32.158
This got to stop.

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.896
No more.

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:40.004
- No more.
- No more what?

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.268
- You asked for help, and you got it.
- Not anymore.

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:48.370
What do you want? More advice?

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:53.476
Here's some advice. You sent some
fucking assholes to the grave early.

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:55.661
- Don't sweat it.
- Shut up!

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.268
What, you gonna cry?

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.849
Over them?

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:04.753
They made their choice, and they knew
their day was gonna come.

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:08.591
And when it comes, are they sorry? No.

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:10.926
They're still reaching for a gun,
trying to aim it at us.

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.965
Stephan is dead.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.864
He's dead.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:19.439
Killing is not gonna
bring him back, and...

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.640
and what we did...

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:28.470
it was wrong.

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.469
You think it's over for Alejandro?

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.995
He's coming.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:46.962
- He's coming.
- I'll be...

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:50.282
- And he's not gonna stop coming.
- He's not gonna stop coming.

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:54.170
- Until he finds you at Ben's.
- At Ben's.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.785
- And he said he's gonna kill Justin.
- Justin...

01:17:59.485 --> 01:18:02.006
- I have to...
- Finish the job.

01:18:02.106 --> 01:18:04.953
Finish the job. When...

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:09.785
- move on.
- Yes, so we can move on.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.992
- Together.
- Together.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.257
No.

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:20.237
I'm done after this.
I'm done after this.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.504
It's not up to you.

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.675
The gun in Justin's bag.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.048
Little girl...

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.126
who do you think did all that?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.112
Go say your goodbyes.

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.396
Jefe?

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.731
You hungry?

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.833
Nobody's home.

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:33.336
I talked to Patrice about
another dinner and movie night.

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.864
I have Patrice's car.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:38.050
So, where do I drive
and pick up the rest of them?

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:40.636
- Yeah, yeah.
- Like I said...

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:43.305
anything you need, let me know.

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:44.328
Ben?

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.945
Could you look after Justin for me,
if you don't mind,

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:53.682
while I just... go over to the house,
finish some stuff?

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:57.219
Sure. Hope you can
tear yourself away tonight.

01:20:57.819 --> 01:21:00.158
Yeah, I can.

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.993
Damn. That bitch
is right across the street.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.787
Here she comes.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:51.824
If you don't do it, I will.

01:21:53.807 --> 01:21:58.285
I'm sorry, sorry... Sorry. Sorry.

01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:01.850
You can't stop it.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.819
- Yo, what the fuck is that?
- What the hell?

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.254
Get out, man! Get the fuck out of here!

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:08.498
- Can't stop it now.
- But I can stop you.

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.327
Yo, get out!

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:34.495
Lila!

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.337
I got you.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:46.895
It's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

01:22:47.695 --> 01:22:49.495
Adhesive on the trim.

01:22:49.595 --> 01:22:54.636
All flammable. Not exactly safe.
Especially around a gas stove.

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.205
And right after
Alejandro's house gets shot up,

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:59.150
he just happens to end up at her house?
Come on. Give me a fucking break.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.579
Somebody's mother.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:07.883
And you got her pulling "Dirty Harry."
Exploding stove, rigged house.

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:11.887
She gets out of the hospital tomorrow.
We bring her in, lean on her.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.590
Then we take it upstairs.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:17.233
You my partner for a long time.

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.295
But you bring this upstairs,
you bring it alone.

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:23.905
<i>Detective Scaketti
to Captain Parker's office.</i>

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:28.487
It's good work, though, man.
It's real good work.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:39.281
So, before we eat this wonderful cake
that Patrice made,

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:43.017
look at all these donations for Lila.

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.023
Y'all shouldn't have done all that.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:52.294
We thought you could use a little
cheering up, along with clothes and...

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:55.898
- well, everything you might need.
- Thank you.

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:58.055
I think I see a new face.

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:02.305
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:09.687
So, why don't we take our break?

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:17.953
I saw some of these things.

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.523
When I was in your son's room that time.

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:22.566
Yeah.

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:26.795
Justin won an art contest,
and so the women wanted to see it.

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:29.431
So I brought it here today
for the party.

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:32.768
- Lucky it didn't get lost in the fire.
- No, I got it...

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.726
I'm gonna need you to come in.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.003
I already answered all the questions.

01:24:42.103 --> 01:24:44.646
We need you to clear up a few things.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:50.452
I think you know what I'm talking about.
That fire, those shootings.

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:53.356
People got killed, and...

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:57.626
I'm sorry,
that's what it's come down to.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:01.163
Nothing else. You sure?

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:03.365
That's what it has to come down to.

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:06.911
Who are you trying to convince?

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:12.540
If you don't come with me now,
it's gonna be Ben coming with me

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.677
and then Justin. It's up to you.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:18.451
Now, you know they didn't
have nothing to do with this.

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.261
I'll go.

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:29.696
I'm willing to take whatever happens.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:37.032
- What is this about?
- It's okay, Mae. I have to go with him.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.335
If it's about the fire and all those
shootings that have been all over the news,

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:43.005
if that's what you want to talk to her about,
then there's something you need to know.

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:46.508
- Patrice, let me go with him, okay?
- Lila lives near me.

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:49.111
And she was having a real hard time.

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.715
Not that you'd understand that or care,
but I looked in on her from time to time.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.242
Some of the nights you talking about,
I know I was with her.

01:25:56.342 --> 01:25:58.954
- I spent time with her, too.
- So did I. We all did.

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:01.102
- Sydney and Tia and I were there.
- No!

01:26:01.202 --> 01:26:02.891
- We went to dinner last week.
- No!

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:05.327
- You gave Sydney the ride.
- I don't want you all doing this.

01:26:05.477 --> 01:26:09.381
- Lila, stop.
- I'm not gonna let you guys do this.

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:12.233
Lila, we have to do this.

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:30.253
A roomful of grieving mothers.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.730
Hell of an alibi.

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:56.845
I'm gonna miss you.
Come on, let's get in.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:59.281
- Take care of that leg, okay?
- All right.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.807
- We'll see you soon, Ben?
- Okay, let me know where you end up.

01:27:02.907 --> 01:27:05.259
- All right? All right.
- Okay.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.499
Glad you're already thinking
about a visit.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.769
I've been thinking
about a lot of things.

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:22.943
I'll be thinking about them, too.

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.612
For a real long time.

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:30.038
And about you even longer.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:37.197
I feel the same way, too. But, I mean...

01:27:37.797 --> 01:27:41.389
- you're leaving. I mean, I... we just...
- I don't have any words of wisdom.

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.792
I wish I did.

01:27:43.892 --> 01:27:48.299
All I know is that you'll find your way.

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:51.659
And I hope to, too.

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:03.811
I'll keep an eye out for your mail.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.336
Are you all right?

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:26.340
No, baby.

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:32.348
But I'm gonna be. I have you.

01:28:34.241 --> 01:28:37.779
<i>My boyfriend's name is Billy,
he comes from little Philly</i>

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:42.050
<i>With a cherry on his nose
and 10 big, fat toes</i>

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:46.224
<i>And that's the way my story goes</i>
