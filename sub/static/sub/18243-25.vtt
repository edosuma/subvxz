00:06.441 --> 00:06.789
Previously on
"Just Add Magic"...

00:06.876 --> 00:09.357
I was walking in the garden
when I murdered Lord Cumberland,

00:09.444 --> 00:12.316
and-- Wait.
Murdered, that--
that's not right.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.491
If I can't be an actor,

00:13.578 --> 00:14.710
I'd still like to be
a part of it.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.538
Maybe you can
help build sets.

00:16.625 --> 00:20.107
How could you?
Spying on my mom
for Adam Lever?

00:20.194 --> 00:21.456
You make my dad
really happy,

00:21.543 --> 00:23.501
and that makes me happy.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.200
I came across an old box
you sold us a while back.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.201
Oh, yes.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.118
Laura, who is this?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.945
Hannah: Maybe you spelled
Noelle and RJ

00:33.033 --> 00:35.339
so that you were
the only protector
who remembers magic.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.254
That's a lovely theory,
Hannah, but for the fact

00:37.341 --> 00:38.777
that I'm not
a protector.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.997
Mr. Morris:
RJ was the prankster
of the group.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.173
Noelle, who loved
taking shortcuts.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.002
And then there was Caroline,
all trouble.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.352
Caroline got more
and more ambitious.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.746
She cooked a Chameleon
Cauliflower spell

00:50.833 --> 00:52.530
to completely change
her appearance.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.142
No one has seen or heard
from her in nearly 20 years.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.535
Darbie: Caroline's the one
making everyone forget magic.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.147
And it's only a matter of time
before she spells us all.

What are you copying?

01:12.420 --> 01:13.812
Pop quiz.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.379
- Ouch, harsh.
- Mm-hm.

01:15.466 --> 01:16.815
It's almost
winter break.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.383
Mm-hm, exactly.
Gotta keep the kids
on their toes.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.907
Hm, oh, my.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.474
What are you doing
for break?

01:23.561 --> 01:24.736
I'm gonna hang out
with the family.

01:24.823 --> 01:25.911
How about you?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.870
I don't know.
Haven't quite decided yet.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.672
Well?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.979
Bad news:
We're having a pop quiz.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.634
- Ugh.
- Good news:

01:52.721 --> 01:55.202
I've got a copy.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.812
I love magic.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.383
♪♪

02:06.517 --> 02:08.997
Okay, Caroline
could be anyone,

02:09.085 --> 02:10.651
but if she's
spelling people,

02:10.739 --> 02:12.436
chances are,
we've come across her.

02:12.523 --> 02:13.481
If it's a her.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.004
Remember what
Mr. Morris said.

02:15.091 --> 02:18.138
She could be a man,
an old woman,
a young college kid.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.140
Okay,
Darbie, we get it.
Not helping.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.229
There's gotta be something
that we've missed.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.492
I mean, Caroline may have
changed her appearance,

02:24.579 --> 02:27.321
but she's still
the same person
on the inside.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.279
Right.
Well, we know that
she was a dancer,

02:29.366 --> 02:30.541
and also kind of
rebellious.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.760
But if she's posing
as someone else,

02:31.847 --> 02:32.804
she would hide all that.

02:32.891 --> 02:33.936
Still not helping.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.939
Seriously. Do you have
any other ideas?

02:37.026 --> 02:38.984
Well,
in "Murder Masquerade"

02:39.071 --> 02:40.682
the inspector notices
small little clues

02:40.769 --> 02:42.292
no one else does.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.337
Clues.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.425
Yeah, like the thump
they heard

02:44.512 --> 02:45.643
coming from
the upstairs vestibule

02:45.730 --> 02:47.993
had to have been from
Miss Abernathy tripping.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.387
Her slight limp
gave her away.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.911
Wait, I-- I think I saw
a recipe that could help us.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.309
Here it is.
Solve the Clues-Cous.

02:59.396 --> 03:02.356
The riddle says,
"Don't be fooled by
a picture that's big,

03:02.443 --> 03:04.923
"even the largest trees
are made up of twigs.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.708
"When all the dots
have been connected,

03:06.795 --> 03:08.623
"what you see
will be detected."

03:08.710 --> 03:10.494
It calls for
galafrasian pepper

03:10.581 --> 03:12.453
and one-eighth teaspoon
per hour

03:12.540 --> 03:14.194
of torian garlic powder.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.761
How much garlic powder
do we have?

03:16.848 --> 03:21.201
Uh... looks like enough to
probably last us until 7:00.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.551
Great. Opening night
of "Murder Masquerade"
is tonight,

03:23.638 --> 03:25.466
so we can follow clues
until the play starts.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.207
I better not have any.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.210
I'm meeting Mr. Morris
to work on how Caroline's
spelling everyone.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.299
And he did not react well
the last time

03:32.386 --> 03:34.344
we tried to use magic
to solve a problem.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.954
Yeah. Good call.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.653
Okay, Darbie,
let's become detectives.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.658
♪♪

04:07.725 --> 04:09.684
Not lovin'
the couscous.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.425
It's not dinner,
it's a spell.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.777
I'm not feeling
detective-y. You?

04:15.864 --> 04:17.517
[footsteps approaching]

04:17.605 --> 04:18.692
Hey, girls.
What's up?

04:18.779 --> 04:20.651
Not much.
Just made a snack.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.610
You made couscous
for a snack?

04:22.697 --> 04:24.786
Yeah, it's very filling.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.614
- Huh.
- Hm.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.704
Oh, no, Buddy must have
scratched the table again.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.183
[thinking]
Wait a second.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.796
Crumbs over by that chair?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.232
Something's not
adding up here.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.106
Buddy couldn't have
done this.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.631
It's sweet of you
to cover for him.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.023
Yeah, I never covered
for my brother.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.895
In fact, I blamed him
for everything.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.853
Buddy always sits
in that chair,

04:48.940 --> 04:51.073
and those are his
pretzel crumbs.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.422
It's clear
who did this.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.990
This scratch was
caused by you, Mrs. Q.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.818
Me? What are you
talking about?

04:56.905 --> 04:58.820
The corner of your briefcase
scraped the table.

04:58.907 --> 04:59.908
Like this.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.349
- See?
- Huh.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.829
I guess you're right.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.657
Boy, I feel bad now
accusing Buddy.

05:09.744 --> 05:10.832
Jill: Okay,
that's freaky.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.616
How'd you
figure that out?

05:12.703 --> 05:15.140
We watch a lot
of mysteries.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.446
I'm watching
the wrong shows.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.100
[chuckles]
We'd better get going.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.406
See you later, girls.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.540
That was so cool.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.455
Okay, I've got to go do
a final prop check,

05:25.542 --> 05:26.500
then I'll meet up
with you, Kell,

05:26.587 --> 05:27.849
and we can get
our detective on.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.894
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.380
Good.
I'm glad you're here.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.077
[thinking]
Something's up with Piper.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.514
She looks nervous.

05:40.601 --> 05:41.906
She's biting her lip.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.953
Take a deep breath, Piper.
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.390
I hope so.
It's hours away from
opening night.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.610
- Everyone's gonna be here--
- Don't worry.

05:49.697 --> 05:50.611
You're going to do great.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.049
- Where's Amanda?
- I don't know.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.094
I'm sure she's
here somewhere.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.749
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.449
Darbie: [thinking]
Miss Balfour looks stressed.

06:02.536 --> 06:06.540
Okay, kids.
Everybody gather around.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.847
We... have a situation.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.373
Amanda's got the flu
and can't perform tonight.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.070
- How did you--
- She's not here,

06:15.157 --> 06:16.245
Piper hasn't seen her,

06:16.332 --> 06:17.638
the flu's been
going around the school,

06:17.725 --> 06:19.727
and that phone call you took
was from, I'm guessing...

06:19.814 --> 06:21.424
her mom?

06:21.511 --> 06:24.949
Uh-- Yes.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.603
I'm afraid
Darbie is right.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.389
Amanda's not
feeling well enough for
tonight's performance.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.738
But it's opening night.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.088
I know,
and I'm really sorry.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.438
I know how hard you all
have been working,

06:35.525 --> 06:37.788
but we will have to cancel
tonight's performance,

06:37.875 --> 06:39.921
and just hope she
feels better for tomorrow.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.619
Doubt it.
And you're next.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.884
Hey, what about Darbie?

06:46.971 --> 06:48.016
She could do it.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.583
What? No way,
I'm in tech.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.758
But you know
all the lines.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.803
- I'm not--
- Act II, scene 5.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.936
Lady Higginbotham
always ate her food
in pairs,

06:55.023 --> 06:56.459
two potatoes,
two carrots,

06:56.546 --> 06:57.808
even two pieces
of steak.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.897
Two pieces of steak?
You must be joking,
good sir.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.116
Then we bring out
the plate props

07:01.203 --> 07:02.334
as they move into
the dining room.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.426
Wow.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.384
See?
She can do it.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.907
Okay, just because
I know the lines

07:09.994 --> 07:11.474
doesn't mean I can
pull this off.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.476
I think you can.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.610
You did originally
want the part.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.133
What do you say,
Darbie?

07:21.353 --> 07:23.051
Okay.
I'll do it.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.400
- [cheering]
- Okay.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.408
Hannah:
Livonian is a multiplier.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.410
When cooking with
cedronian and torian,

07:34.497 --> 07:37.326
always use
a little less torian
than you think you need.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.763
I can't believe
how precise this is.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.635
You kept excellent notes.

07:41.722 --> 07:45.595
Well, magic is really
just like, uh, chemistry.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.771
Um, I started the notebook
in the '90s.

07:47.858 --> 07:52.689
It has, uh, riddles,
measurements,

07:52.776 --> 07:54.691
everything I know
about magic, really.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.738
So, what do you have on
the Forget Magic spell?

07:57.825 --> 07:58.782
Ah.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.744
Livonian and elysian.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.441
That's it?

08:05.528 --> 08:06.703
I'm afraid so.

08:06.790 --> 08:10.011
Um, this one
has stumped me.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.665
Do you have an ideas?

08:11.752 --> 08:14.668
Yes. Ever heard of
Can't Recall Caramel?

08:14.755 --> 08:17.148
No. Tell me about it.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.673
Okay, but it's kind of
a long story.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.631
It all started
in the 1800s.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.809
Wow, Darbie,
I can't believe it.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.245
You're the lead?

08:27.332 --> 08:28.551
I know, it's huge.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.031
But it means
I can't be a detective,

08:30.118 --> 08:33.469
because... well,
I have to be a detective.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.384
Don't worry.
I'll take it from here.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.386
You just focus on the play,
and we'll see you later.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.431
Be careful.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.481
What am I missing?

08:52.009 --> 08:53.576

08:53.663 --> 08:55.926
Becky's Voice:

08:56.013 --> 08:59.060
I have some information
that's very important.

08:59.147 --> 09:03.934
There's a box,
and the book is the key
to the magic--

09:04.021 --> 09:08.417
Huh. Totally lost
my train of thought,
uh...

09:08.504 --> 09:09.853
Must be having
a senior moment.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.464
See you soon, sweetie.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.815
Becky's Voice:
Kelly, it's me.
Call me right away.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.948

that's very important.

09:18.035 --> 09:21.865

and the book is the key
to the magic--

[thinking]
Bells ringing in
the background.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.912
Becky: Totally lost
my train of thought.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.914
[thinking]
Grandma wasn't at
the antique store.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.872
Where did she go?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.616
Darbie.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
I wanted to wish you luck
for opening night.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.362
Oh, nice.
You made cookies.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.363
How did you know
I brought cookies?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.886
If it were cupcakes,

09:42.973 --> 09:44.627
you wouldn't let
the container
rest on its side.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.411
And you don't like
brownies.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.284
Oh. Right.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.938
What are you wearing?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.462
I'm now the lead
in the play.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.116
But the costume
is too big.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.031
Amanda was so much taller
than me.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.338
The lead?
Wow, Darbie,
that's amazing.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.602
And I know how to sew.
I can take in your costume
for you.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.777
- You can?
- Mm-hm.

10:03.864 --> 10:07.128
Oh, that would be so great.
Thank you, Amy.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.738
And once we freed Rose
from the book,

10:08.825 --> 10:11.132
they returned to
the 1800s.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.570
And all this started when, uh--
What did you call them?

10:14.657 --> 10:16.964
- The OCs.
- When the OCs
gave this Chuck

10:17.051 --> 10:18.139
Can't Recall Caramel?

10:18.226 --> 10:20.968
Yes. I think Caroline
is altering it

10:21.055 --> 10:23.187
to make everyone
forget magic.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.625
The difference is
people are being spelled
from a distance.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.974
Right.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.802
Rather than Caroline
spelling people

10:28.889 --> 10:30.760
by having them eat
the caramel,

10:30.847 --> 10:33.110
I think she's eating
the caramel.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.939
And there's a time release
element to it.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.724
Torian.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.596
Yes. Oh.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.032
Great job, Hannah.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.382
You said that Kelly and Darbie
are looking for Caroline.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.819
Once we find her,

10:45.906 --> 10:48.038
we have to make sure that
she can't hurt anybody else.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.692
You want to make Caroline
forget magic?

10:49.779 --> 10:50.998
It's the only way
to stop her.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.913
We can cook the
Can't Recall Caramel,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.610
but substitute
something torian,

10:54.697 --> 10:57.091
like... sugar.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.658
I don't know.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.877
Plus, we don't have
any spices.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.184
What about Mama P's pantry
that you told me about?

11:03.271 --> 11:05.186
Well, she knows
I'm mad at her.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.971
She'd be suspicious
if I just walked in.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.453
Hannah, what have I
been trying to tell you

11:11.540 --> 11:12.933
since the school year
started?

11:13.020 --> 11:14.543
That I need to
apply myself,

11:14.630 --> 11:18.547
because Fox Canyon's
a lot more demanding
than Rockbury.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.680
To think outside the box.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.290
That, too.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.944
Oh! I got it.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.860
Mama P can't remember anything
having to do with magic, right?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.775
Right.
Now you're thinking.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.388
Thanks so much
for doing this.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.173
- You're a lifesaver.
- It's my pleasure.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.527
That's an interesting
necklace.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.399
Is that a lemur?

11:44.486 --> 11:45.748
It is. My grandma
gave it to me

11:45.835 --> 11:47.619
when I graduated
high school.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.534
[thinking]
Where have I
seen that before?

11:49.621 --> 11:51.580
Lemurs.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.409
Lavender Heights Lemurs.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.932
Did you go to
Lavender Heights?

11:56.019 --> 11:58.456
Mm-hm.
I thought you knew that?

11:58.543 --> 12:00.589
[thinking]
Lavender Heights High,
where Caroline went.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.852
- How's that?
- Looks good.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.288
Did your grandmother
teach you how to sew?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.768
I taught myself.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.596
I used to do a lot of
performance stuff
in high school,

12:07.683 --> 12:10.077
and costumes
never fit me right.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.818
[thinking]
Look how Amy's standing.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.994
With her feet
turned out like that,
she looks like a...

12:14.081 --> 12:15.560
ballet dancer.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.781
Let me guess.
You were a dancer?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.783
Yes. How did you know?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.002
Lucky guess.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.438
[chuckling]

12:23.525 --> 12:25.657
[thinking]
More like unlucky guess.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.963
I don't believe it.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.574
Could Amy be...

12:29.661 --> 12:30.880
Caroline?

12:34.928 --> 12:37.060
Hi, Grandma.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.497
Kelly. Ohh.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.587
What a pleasant surprise.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.111
What are you doing here?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.330
I just came by to say hi.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.468
Grandma,
can I see your phone?

12:53.555 --> 12:56.514
I want to update
the antiquing app
I found for you.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.646
Sure.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.217
[thinking]
All the usual places,

13:03.304 --> 13:05.872
my house, her house,
the antique store.

13:05.959 --> 13:09.353
Wait. I don't recognize
this address.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.012
[thinking]
Can Amy really be
Caroline?

13:16.099 --> 13:18.536
Is that why she's
dating my dad?

13:18.623 --> 13:20.060
I need to be sure.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.845
So, you drove
all the way across town

13:22.932 --> 13:24.542
just to bring me cookies?

13:24.629 --> 13:28.198
Well, kind of slow day,
so I figured why not.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.768
[thinking]
Slow day?

13:32.855 --> 13:35.727
Hm. I can smell
the nail salon fumes
from here.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.904
Why didn't she mention
she got a manicure?

13:37.991 --> 13:39.731
And why is she
so dressed up?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.647
You were just
home all day?

13:42.734 --> 13:43.997
Yep.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.479
[thinking]
Sweat. No eye contact.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.699
Classic physical signs
of lying.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.527
She's clearly
hiding something.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.616
So, when are Kelly
and Hannah getting here?

13:54.703 --> 13:55.704
What do you mean?

13:55.791 --> 13:56.836
Well, I assume
they're coming.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.446
It'll be nice to see them.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.534
[thinking]
Oh, no.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.710
Amy/Caroline is
trying to find out

14:01.797 --> 14:03.538
whether all the protectors
will be at the play

14:03.625 --> 14:05.845
so she can curse us
at the same time.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.020
This is bad.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.022
They may come.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.458
Whatever.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.286
Who knows.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.726
It's so nice to see
young people

14:17.813 --> 14:19.467
getting involved
in politics.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.991
It's easy when you have
a great candidate like
Terri Quinn.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.087
Are you moving?

14:31.174 --> 14:33.481
My, you're observant.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.701
Yes. Unfortunately,
I need to move
on short notice.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.052
Not even sure I'll
have time to vote.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.096
[thinking]
Strange.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.663
My grandmother
visited Laura,

14:41.750 --> 14:44.405
and now she
suddenly has to move?

14:44.492 --> 14:46.233
She's hiding something.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.277
Where are you going?

14:51.499 --> 14:52.717
Looks like somewhere cold.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.590
Yes. Well,
unfortunately,

14:55.677 --> 14:58.810
there isn't much for me
here anymore.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.770
Wait a minute.
I know you.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.990
You're Kelly Quinn.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.993
[thinking] Uh-oh.
How does she know my name?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.429
Have we met?

15:08.516 --> 15:11.084
I saw your picture
in the paper
with your mother.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.955
Oh. [chuckles]

15:13.042 --> 15:15.827
[thinking]
Darbie said Caroline
could be anybody.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.742
Even an older woman.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.396
Forgive me
for being rude,

15:19.483 --> 15:21.050
can I offer you
anything to eat?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.747
[thinking]
So you can spell me?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.097
I don't think so.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.708
Bottled water
if you have it.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.451
Sorry, I don't.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.974
Nothing for me, then.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.802
Thank you.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.372
- Hey, Mama P.
- Hannah.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.851
What are you doing
back here?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.114
I assume after last night,

15:41.201 --> 15:43.420
I'm the last person
you want to see.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.987
You're right,
but I'm not here for you.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.641
I'm just here to take
some magical spices

15:46.728 --> 15:49.209
from your secret
magical spice pantry.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.428
What on earth
are you talking ab--

15:51.515 --> 15:52.777
What?

16:02.004 --> 16:03.484
What was that?

16:05.399 --> 16:07.618
Thanks for
the magic spices, Mama P.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.795
Also, shame on you for
what you did to Mrs. Quinn.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.580
Now, of course,
you won't remember
any of this

16:12.667 --> 16:14.451
because it has to do
with magic.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.539
Bye.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.894
What was I just doing?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.897
Oh, right.
[sighs]

16:27.987 --> 16:31.512
So, when are you
moving, exactly?

16:31.599 --> 16:34.645
As soon as I tie up
a few loose ends.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.038
[thinking]
Tie up loose ends?

16:36.125 --> 16:38.780
Like spelling the rest of us
and taking the book?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.651
Okay, drop the act,
Caroline.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.479
I know what's going on.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.003
Caroline?

16:44.090 --> 16:46.918
Why did you call me
Caroline?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.617
I know you're
pretending to be Laura.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.880
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.534
I knew a Caroline.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.232
I was her family's
housekeeper.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.148
Housekeeper?

16:59.235 --> 17:01.411
You're not the first person
to come here asking about her.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.718
We were very close.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.373
Is she in
some kind of trouble?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.983
No, I-- I just wanted to
speak with her.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.942
Do you know where
I could find her?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.380
Like I told the woman
from the antique store,

17:13.467 --> 17:16.470
I haven't seen her
in a long, long time.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.561
[thinking]
She's telling the truth.

17:26.609 --> 17:28.438
Is this your sister?

17:28.525 --> 17:30.527
Yes.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.181
She looks like you.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.795
You're moving to be
closer to her, aren't you?

17:37.882 --> 17:39.058
Yes.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.670
She's not well and
I want to be near her.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.411
I'm sorry.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.893
Kelly: [thinking]
Look at the dust.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.765
There was a picture there.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.810
Where's the frame
that was there?

17:52.897 --> 17:55.770
Oh. That's odd.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.381
I didn't pack it yet.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.427
Maybe someone took it.

18:00.514 --> 18:04.126
I can't see why,
it was just a picture
of a few friends.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.607
The only other person
who's even been in here

18:06.694 --> 18:08.348
was that woman from
the antique store,

18:08.435 --> 18:10.480
and she wouldn't have
taken it.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.482
[thinking]
Oh, yes, she would.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.354
The answer is in the photo.

18:14.441 --> 18:18.619
Grandma
must have figured out
who Caroline is.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.838
Do you usually get
dressed up to bake?

18:20.925 --> 18:23.363
And that's
a fresh manicure.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.799
Okay, you got me.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.149
I don't know how
you found out.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.369
You've had us all fooled
for weeks.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.371
Weeks? But I got
the offer today.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.982
Wait, what?
What offer?

18:34.069 --> 18:36.811
For a job in
Juniper Hills.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.682
I had the final interview
today.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.684
[thinking]
A job interview?

18:40.771 --> 18:43.383
That's why she looks so nice
and was acting nervous.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.036
She didn't want to tell me.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.344
But Juniper Hills is
five hours away.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.477
I know.
It's more money,

18:50.564 --> 18:52.043
but it's longer hours,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.916
and I would have to
date your dad long distance.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.744
Are you gonna take it?

18:56.831 --> 18:57.875
I don't know.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.923
[thinking]
A least she's not Caroline.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.578
But I could lose Amy
in my life.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.846
[indistinct chatter]

19:13.152 --> 19:14.805
It was so nice to see you.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.068
Don't forget to vote.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.461
[whispering]
I still don't know
what we're doing here

19:18.548 --> 19:19.810
so close to
the election.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.030
Shouldn't we be,
I don't know,
making calls or--

19:22.117 --> 19:24.859
Small town elections
live and die on things
like school plays.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.296
It shows you support
the arts.

19:27.383 --> 19:31.126
We can duck out
after it begins.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.867
And I think
Grandma took the photo
from Laura's house.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.434
I need to find it.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.696
Wait.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.311
Well, that's weird.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.399
What is it?

19:43.486 --> 19:45.053
The spell was trying to
tell me something,

19:45.140 --> 19:46.097
but it--
it just stopped.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.494
7:00.
The torian ran out.

19:51.581 --> 19:52.713
Let's go find Darbie
and wish her luck.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.757
We'll be right back.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.411
Go. I'll grab us
some seats.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.807
...the kind of cold
that gets in your bones.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.505
- The perfect weather--
- Darbie.

20:02.592 --> 20:03.680
Oh, you look amazing.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.769
Yeah, like an actual
detective.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.423
I don't know if
I can do this.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.208
Amanda's so lucky
she got the flu.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.732
It's just stage fright.
You're going to do great.

20:11.819 --> 20:12.776
More than great.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.691
You were born to play
the inspector.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.824
I do love
detective stories.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.609
Take a deep breath.

20:19.696 --> 20:20.871
We're with you.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.400
Do you remember our
middle school play?

20:27.487 --> 20:29.837
You were a frog
or a lizard--

20:29.924 --> 20:31.447
An iguana.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.145
Our hippie teacher
wrote the play.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.147
It was about
the peace movement

20:36.235 --> 20:37.758
as told by zoo animals.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.195
That's right.
I was a wolf.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.545
And Ida was a giraffe?

20:42.632 --> 20:44.721
Actually,
I was a llama.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.897
[chuckles]
Is this seat taken?

20:48.508 --> 20:49.987
Yes.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.989
But I see some
Lever supporters over there.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.295
Maybe you can
sit with them.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.344
[sighs]

20:59.475 --> 21:01.869
- Hey.
- How's Darbie?

21:01.956 --> 21:04.437
She's good.
A little nervous.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.568
Nervous is okay.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.222
As long as she
still remembers magic.

21:26.372 --> 21:31.507
[British accent]
It was a cold, dark winter
in weary old Yorkshire.

21:31.594 --> 21:35.076
The kind of cold
that gets in your bones.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.819
The perfect weather...

21:38.906 --> 21:40.037
for murder.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.866
[thunder]

21:42.953 --> 21:45.826
♪♪[big band]

21:48.568 --> 21:50.700
He's collapsed.
Inspector Langham.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
It's Lord Cumberland.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.621
And he's been... murdered.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.145
[applause]

22:03.539 --> 22:04.888
We're so glad
you could join us.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.803
We don't get many detectives
around here.

22:06.890 --> 22:10.024
Save the niceties
for your husband,
Lady Higgenbotham.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.679
I'm here to figure out
who killed Lord Cumberland.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.637
She's really good.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.160
I know.
I'm impressed.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.423
[thunder]

22:17.510 --> 22:20.774
All killers need motive,
opportunity, and means.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.733
But it's the little things
that reveal the truth.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.823
For starters,
isn't it odd that
Lady Higgenbotham

22:26.910 --> 22:30.740
would vacation here in this
modest country inn,

22:30.827 --> 22:33.352
when she's used to staying
at the Savoy in London?

22:36.485 --> 22:39.314
I-- I just figured it out.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.577
I know who the killer is.

22:41.664 --> 22:45.364
[whispering]
No, you don't.
Not yet.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.062
I think Darbie's
just figured out
the mystery.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.151
I think she knows
who Caroline is.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.674
There's no Caroline
in this play.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.328
Please keep it down.
I'm trying to watch.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.071
We're talking about
Caroline.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.378
You know,
the one who's been
spelling everyone

22:59.465 --> 23:00.509
to forget magic.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.076
Spelling everyone?

23:02.163 --> 23:03.338
I don't even know why
I came to this play,

23:03.425 --> 23:04.383
but you're ruining it.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.689
Shh!

23:06.776 --> 23:08.343
Mr. Morris has
forgotten magic.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.779
How is that even possible?

23:09.866 --> 23:11.999
Caroline must be here.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.480
And Darbie's on stage
unprotected.

23:14.567 --> 23:15.785
Caroline could be anyone.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.582
I think I know
what the spell was
trying to show me.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.847
[whispering] Grandma,
do you have a mint?

23:33.934 --> 23:35.544
[whispering]
In my purse.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.897
Lady Higgenbotham
showed up out of nowhere
from the big city.

23:40.984 --> 23:45.075
Yes, I lived in London,
but that doesn't mean--

23:45.162 --> 23:46.381
Even though
Lady Higgenbotham

23:46.468 --> 23:49.123
only worked on major
political campaigns,

23:49.210 --> 23:52.953
she knew she needed access to
the victims and their books.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.130
What is she doing?
She's making stuff up.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.178
[whispering]
Hannah.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.095
Both: Jill.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.538
Laura, who is this?

24:12.625 --> 24:13.713
I'd like you to meet Jill.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.541
Jill usually only works
at the federal level.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.892
In summation,
Lady Higgenbotham

24:18.979 --> 24:21.938
had access and
opportunity.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.810
She knew her victims.

24:23.897 --> 24:28.205
She was at Madam Peabody's
where she had access to

24:28.292 --> 24:30.904
Madam Peabody and
Miss Silvertooth.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.993
[whispering]
Who's Miss Silvertooth?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.864
No idea.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.300
She manipulated
the detectives

24:36.387 --> 24:39.478
by helping them
break down a barrier
in the case.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.480
I thought I was getting better
as a public speaker.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.439
Oh, you are.
But you need to
drop your guard

24:44.526 --> 24:46.223
or you'll never
get through to people.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.530
That's a great idea,
Jill.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.490
But Lady Higgenbotham
wasn't always on her game.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.492
Sometimes she
let things slip,

24:53.579 --> 24:55.319
like during
the billiards game
when she mentioned

24:55.406 --> 24:58.192
she used to be
a chorus girl.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.064
Here's a tip
my teacher gave me once
before a performance.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.284
Breathe,
pull your shoulders back.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.026
Imagine your spine
is made of steel.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.941
And that's how I knew
it was you.

25:08.028 --> 25:11.248
You tricked us all,
Lady Jillenbotham.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.515
[applause]

25:19.343 --> 25:21.041
- It's Jill.
- We know.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.738
Look, she has
a drink in her bag.

25:22.825 --> 25:23.957
That must be
the spell.

25:24.044 --> 25:24.958
We need to stop her.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.354
- She's getting away.
- Do you see her?

25:32.792 --> 25:33.923
She's gone.
