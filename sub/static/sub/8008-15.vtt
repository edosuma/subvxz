10:48.064 --> 10:49.941
It looked so real on the overcoats!

10:49.941 --> 10:50.942
How did you do it?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.195
This play is gonna run for 20 years!

10:53.194 --> 10:54.821
(LAUGHING)

10:55.321 --> 10:56.823
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:57.073 --> 10:58.700
That was my job, actually.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.668
Putting raindrops on the overcoats.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.080
I only went on stage
as a last-minute replacement.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.833
You mean, you did the special effects?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.210
You're amazing, kid!

11:08.209 --> 11:10.712
Aww, you're amazing, Dad!

11:10.837 --> 11:11.838
JAKE: You're amazing!

11:11.838 --> 11:12.839
VIOLA: You're amazing!

11:15.175 --> 11:18.725
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:22.850
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.477 --> 11:28.696
This party is so crazy!
