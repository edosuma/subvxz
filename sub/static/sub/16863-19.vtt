WEBVTT

00:00.709 --> 00:02.044
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.085 --> 00:02.878
Oh, you're the, uh-

00:02.920 --> 00:05.714
Hot older chick who saved her own ass
in the brownstone fire the other night.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.216
Hey, ma'am, you can't go- No!

00:07.257 --> 00:09.218
Come on!
Get her the hell out of there!

00:10.427 --> 00:11.261
That was awesome.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.596
What the hell was in
that box the other night?

00:12.638 --> 00:14.181
Yeah, yeah. What was in
that box the other night?

00:14.216 --> 00:14.806
None of your business.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.516
It is our business if
you're runnin' into a fire-

00:16.551 --> 00:18.536
- Nobody's talkin' to you, opie.
- My name's tommy.

00:18.571 --> 00:20.521
Yeah, but you got kind of
a ron howard thing goin' on.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.731
Are you free tomorrow night?

00:22.773 --> 00:23.732
Uh, yeah.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.275
Call me for the time and place.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.528
Frank, he's got problems
with his cock, dude.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.904
So what's the problem this time, peewee?

00:28.939 --> 00:30.590
Looks like a hairy cheese doodle.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.241
- What?
- Yeah, it's orange.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.576
Look, you've probably heard
through the grapevine already,

00:34.618 --> 00:36.870
you know, I-I'm gettin'
married in a couple days.

00:36.905 --> 00:38.622
I've been hearin' whispers.

00:38.664 --> 00:42.209
I wanted to ask you if you would,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.503
you know, stand up for me, be my best man.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.882
Uh, let me put this in terms
that you can understand.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.235
Sheila's the red sox.
I'm the yankees.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.554
I have a hell of a lot more to offer.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.680
Uh, how do you figure that?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.640
Because I come with your children.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.308
It's a lose-lose situation for me.

00:58.343 --> 00:59.685
If I pick her, I lose you.

00:59.726 --> 01:04.438
If I pick you, I lose her and
access to katy a-and the baby.

01:04.474 --> 01:06.942
I'm eventually gonna find someone else.

01:06.977 --> 01:09.785
You choose me,

01:09.820 --> 01:13.740
and you know what you're
getting both in and out of bed.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.708
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, chief.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.584
Whoa.
Shit.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.711
It's like the goddamn ice capades over here.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.260
Christ.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.881
Hey, agent orange, uh,
how's your peas and carrot?

01:28.916 --> 01:30.347
Won't go back to its normal color.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.260
I'm thinkin' about goin' to the tanning
bed so that the rest of me matches my dick.

01:33.295 --> 01:34.845
Want some vitamin water?
I got all kinds of flavors.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.306
Yeah.
You got any, uh, garrity flavored?

01:37.341 --> 01:38.720
That would be orange.
No?

01:38.755 --> 01:40.100
Got blue, color of my balls.

01:40.135 --> 01:41.268
All right, gimme that.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.270
Yeah, the rac, you know, it's
not exactly a pussy wagon, is it?

01:43.312 --> 01:46.189
Needles was workin' that one time
years ago when he hurt his back.

01:46.224 --> 01:49.067
Said he was more likely to get
laid drivin' a pink prius, you know?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.069
But it's n-it's more of
a downtime type of gig, right?

01:51.104 --> 01:52.905
Oh, yeah. It's sweet, man.
Feinberg hooked me up.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.164
All I do is go job to job
handin' out vitamin water.

01:55.199 --> 01:58.327
I mean, occasionally I gotta get the
thawing apparatus to deice the hydrant,

01:58.368 --> 02:02.414
but I pretty much just sit in the bus
watchin' old bootleg movies on my laptop.

02:02.449 --> 02:04.541
Oh, sh- Oh, shawn.

02:04.583 --> 02:08.086
Cancel his admission for
blax capades, by the way.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.880
You got any salt in the
rig there, ginger dick?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.340
I don'T.
Just vitamin water.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.508
Look, make yourself useful, huh?

02:12.543 --> 02:13.599
Go get some salt

02:13.634 --> 02:17.054
and bring it out here before somebody
breaks his goddamn neck on this goddamn ice.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.514
I'm sorry to tell you this, chief,

02:18.555 --> 02:21.475
but I don't believe that falls under my
jurisdiction as a member of the rac unit,

02:21.510 --> 02:23.852
and I've even done the research.
I went onto the department website,

02:23.894 --> 02:26.605
and apparently all I'm responsible
for is thawing and vitamin water,

02:26.640 --> 02:28.065
so-I got towels. You want towels?

02:28.106 --> 02:31.074
Look, my jewish ass hits this sidewalk

02:31.109 --> 02:34.571
before you get back with the
world's biggest bag of salt,

02:34.613 --> 02:39.201
your ass is gonna make the gaza
strip look like miami goddamn beach.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.369
I got a better idea.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.413
- I'm gonna go get some salt.
- Get some pretzels, too.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.543
I thought I told you to
shave off the goddamn goatee.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.211
I'm the lead singer of a rock band, lou.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.213
I have to have the goatee.
It's part of my vibe.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.756
Yeah, you know, I've been pickin'
up a new vibe from you, mike,

02:52.798 --> 02:54.675
and you know what it is?Dick.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.553
You know what?You can be just as big a
dick without the goatee, mike, all right?

02:57.594 --> 02:58.971
- Yeah.
- You're-you're not a rock star.

02:59.012 --> 02:59.895
You're a fireman.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.766
Yeah, for now, but kelly's
hookin' us up with this a & r guy.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.476
Kelly, the hot chick who
saved herself in the fire?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.562
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's sendin' down a, uh-

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
a guy to listen to the band.

03:08.765 --> 03:10.440
Hey, spics-capades.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.151
And after we rock his world, he's gonna, uh,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.987
sign apache stone to his label.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.447
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
She said all that?

03:17.482 --> 03:19.867
Yeah, the-the part about
sendin' the guy down.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.000
Did you sleep with her?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.747
Tom, I'm tryin' to keep the relationship
on a professional level here.

03:25.782 --> 03:29.459
Yeah, ok, so you got a hot, smart,
independent woman with a great ass,

03:29.501 --> 03:30.919
and you're not interested.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.046
Yeah. Well, it's 'cause
she doesn't have a cock.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.429
I- it's not a gay thing, guys.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.717
- Yeah, well, did you get her naked?
- Yes.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.968
- Did you touch her tits?
- Yes.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.428
- But you didn't sleep with her?
- No.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.889
- Eh, don't get any gayer than that.
- No, it don'T.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.017
Uh, listen, guys, I mean, we were
totally makin' out and everything,

03:45.052 --> 03:46.525
and she's got a slammin' body, by the way,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.105
which I was all over, and
everything was goin' great,

03:50.140 --> 03:53.192
but then I started to sing.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.360
I told you.
Couldn't get it up.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.204
Did-did you just say you started to sing,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.742
- as in singing?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.661
Was this while you were maybe down there
givin' her a little bit of oral pleasure?

04:04.696 --> 04:08.081
'Cause sometimes when I'm down there
doin' that, you know, I-I'll hum.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.626
But you won't actually ever break into song.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.502
No, it's too risky.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.962
Nah, 'cause unless you're datin' a
chick with a microphone in her pussy-

04:13.997 --> 04:15.380
Right, in which case, get right out of it,

04:15.422 --> 04:18.091
'cause the only thing worse than a
pussy with bugs is a bugged pussy.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.511
- Agreed.
- Now, pavarotti, tell me this.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.513
When you were singin', please, tell me

04:22.554 --> 04:24.681
it wasn't an apache stone song.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.308
Uh, it wasn't an apache stone song.

04:26.343 --> 04:27.643
Ok, good.
Thank god for that.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.561
Uh, of course it was an
apache stone song, lou.

04:29.596 --> 04:31.393
I don't know anything
else the whole way through.

04:31.428 --> 04:33.039
Anyway, she got really
pissed off, all right?

04:33.074 --> 04:34.650
- Well, at least she didn't puke on you.
- Yeah.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.194
I mean, you know, not at first,
but after a couple verses-

04:37.236 --> 04:38.869
- Couple of verses.
- This is unbelievable.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.531
You know, most guys won't
go in without a condom.

04:40.566 --> 04:42.282
This asshole needs a set list.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.041
By the time I got to the chorus,

04:44.076 --> 04:46.912
she was, like, half-dressed and
holdin' the door open for me.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.540
Well, how-how did you get her to
agree to have the guy come down and,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.833
you know, in case you
guys are good, make a deal?

04:51.868 --> 04:54.086
I refused to stop singin'
until she promised.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.048
Ok, I'm pickin' up a
new vibe from you, mikey.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.176
Know what this one is?
It's called moron.

05:01.218 --> 05:05.556
Maybe, tom, but a moron who's about
this close to gettin' a record deal.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.765
- All right...
- I'm gonna-I'm gonna hit him.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.481
- I know you-
- I'm gonna hit him.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.017
Ok, ok. All right. Listen to me. Little-

05:09.059 --> 05:11.311
little freddie mercury
here without the talent,

05:11.353 --> 05:14.898
you can keep the chin strap
until the gig, all right?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.442
But if you don't get signed, off it comes,

05:17.484 --> 05:21.321
along with your hair, your
eyebrows, your pubes, everything.

05:21.356 --> 05:24.616
- Pubes, too?
- Hairless as the day you were born.

05:24.658 --> 05:29.162
All right, but when we
do get the record deal,

05:29.197 --> 05:31.832
you guys gotta do the same thing.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.378
- Deal.
- Deal Done, done.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.172
- Good-bye.
- See ya. Bye-bye.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.173
You know, it really is.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.383
It's
- It'S... It's almost gettin' too easy at this point.

05:41.418 --> 05:43.468
It's not fair to him, you know.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.184
Let me guess.
Tastes like, uh, formula 50?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.810
Cat piss.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:46.323 --> 06:48.408
Lay off the bag, puddin'.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.244
I'm cancelin' the wilson fight.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.787
- Chief.
- No arguments.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.413
Hey, look, I know I been a
little sluggish lately, but I-

06:53.455 --> 06:54.832
Your head ain't in it, frankie.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.959
I'm not puttin' you in the ring
with a quality guy like wilson.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.336
I gotta fight, ok?
I got a lot of pent-up shit right now.

06:59.371 --> 07:00.921
Eh, go see a shrink.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.130
If I don't get back in the ring soon,

07:02.172 --> 07:04.716
I swear to god I'm gonna yank some bum
off the sidewalk and beat him senseless.

07:04.751 --> 07:07.135
Come on, man.
Help me out here.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.181
- Well, there is something.
- Anything.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.100
You might have a moral issue with this.

07:13.135 --> 07:15.185
Guy brought it to me last week.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.652
It's a chick.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.440
A chick, like as in a guy in
a chicken suit or somethin'?

07:20.475 --> 07:23.398
No, like a woman in a tits-and-vagina suit.

07:23.433 --> 07:26.321
Some promoter downtown told me about it,

07:26.363 --> 07:30.450
but I figured there's no way you're gonna
hit a broad, so I told him to get lost.

07:30.485 --> 07:32.703
I'm interested.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.836
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.455
I mean, she's a real fighter, right?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.624
Yeah. She's a tiger, from what I hear.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.501
She beat 2 guys across the pond last month.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.254
We'd be, uh, wearin'
headgear and 16-ounce gloves?

07:42.289 --> 07:43.839
The whole thing.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.633
No kickin' or scratchin' or
hair-pullin', nothin' like that?

07:46.668 --> 07:49.386
Frankie, I would never let
you do anything like that,

07:49.421 --> 07:51.138
unless you were behind on points.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.855
Look, this is all aboveboard.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.642
It's underground, of
course, but it's aboveboard.

07:55.677 --> 07:57.603
Yeah.
Tell him we're interested.

07:57.638 --> 07:59.278
- You sure?
- 100%.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.606
All right.
I'll set it up.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.024
All right.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.442
Thanks, chief.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.235
Oh, I gotta tell you, frankie, I figured,

08:05.270 --> 08:06.987
you know, with your brain and conscience,

08:07.029 --> 08:08.739
you would have been a
tougher sell on this thing.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.324
Yeah. There's somethin'
i should let you know

08:10.365 --> 08:12.910
that I just recently found
out about myself, chief.

08:12.945 --> 08:15.078
I ain't really that smart.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.622
It's good to know.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.843
- Hey.
- Uh, hey. You lookin' for mike?

08:29.878 --> 08:32.679
No.
Lookin' for you.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.889
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, kid.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.522
Hoo.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.101
What, do you got some self-esteem
problems we need to talk about?

08:38.143 --> 08:38.942
Not particularly.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.356
Then why do you find it so hard to
imagine I'm here lookin' for you?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.735
Look, I've had the whole older, uh-

08:46.777 --> 08:49.780
well, back in high school, I kinda
slept with one of my teachers, so...

08:49.821 --> 08:51.657
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.283
Well, I didn't wanna assume.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.077
Maybe you went to catholic school.
I don't know.

08:55.112 --> 08:56.703
No, this wasn't a priest.

08:56.738 --> 08:57.412
It was a cougar.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.748
And are you calling me a cougar?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.549
No, ma'am.
I mean, miss. Ms.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.254
My name's kelly, all right?
And I'm not a goddamn cougar.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.880
You're lookin' at a completely
different kind of animal.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.425
Now, I don't usually take this
long in the negotiation stage.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.178
What's it gonna be, shortcake?
You in or out?

09:13.213 --> 09:14.353
Why me?

09:14.388 --> 09:17.474
Because you seem nice,

09:17.516 --> 09:21.436
and you got that skinny, pasty,
floppy-haired hugh grant thing goin' on.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.897
Last time I'm askin'.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.860
Uh, well, you know, it'S...

09:30.946 --> 09:32.406
hold up!

09:32.447 --> 09:34.908
Yeah. Yes.
I want in.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.201
I definitely want in.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.287
Ok.
Uh, 2 things.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.164
I know you're in a band
with mike, which is great.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.748
I can talk music all night long,

09:41.790 --> 09:44.751
and something tells me you
have a higher musical I.Q.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.379
Or a higher I.Q.In general than
mike, but then so does a sparrow,

09:47.421 --> 09:50.591
so I wouldn't wanna stab you in the face
with a fork every time you open your mouth.

09:50.626 --> 09:52.426
But listen to me.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.184
You never, ever,

09:54.219 --> 09:58.265
no matter what happens, you never

09:58.300 --> 10:00.566
sing for me.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.936
- I don't sing.
- Then we're good.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.071
And, uh, what was the second thing?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.984
Ask your mom to pad your curfew a few hours.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.654
Tomorrow night, 10:00.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.867
Yeah, well, I don't
live with my mom anymore.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.226
I can stay up as late as I want, you know!

10:22.261 --> 10:24.583
Hey, cougar meat, your mom's on the phone.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.585
Oh, shit.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.467
- Listen, if it's any help...
- Oh, jesus christ.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.636
I don't think you look
like this opie thing at all.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.054
Thanks.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.932
Maybe a little round the eyes and...

10:39.973 --> 10:41.934
the nose and...

10:42.976 --> 10:44.978
- when you do-
- All right, all right.

10:45.938 --> 10:49.024
Look, I don't think you look like any of
those other guys these assholes think you do.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.901
- Who?
- Come on. Kevin bacon?

10:51.693 --> 10:52.653
- It's ridiculous.
- Yeah.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.780
And willem dafoe?

10:55.614 --> 10:59.576
I don't get the gretzky thing
at all, but david caruso...

10:59.618 --> 11:01.203
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.711
Come on.
He's handsome.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.603
- Yeah.
- You both wear sunglasses a lot.

11:05.638 --> 11:08.196
He's got that-that gravelly voice, you know?

11:08.231 --> 11:10.754
Makes him sound angry even when he's not.

11:10.789 --> 11:13.298
And he's got a sexy walk about him.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.177
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That's what my wife says.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.805
Your wife barely speaks english.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.307
- What's up?
- Nothin'.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.191
No, no. Something's up.
You're buttering me up.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.562
- You're doin' a little dance here, tr-
- Tommy, I'm not buttering you up.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.521
I just came to talk to you.

11:27.563 --> 11:32.317
You're doin' an irish goddamn jig,
my friend. What's the bad news?

11:32.352 --> 11:35.529
What do you want from me, tommy?
It's all bad news.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.787
I mean, look at the world we're livin' in.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.748
I mean, the palestinians
might have nuclear weapons.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.911
Lou's gettin' married and wants me
to be his best man at his wedding.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.628
Derek jeter is on steroids.

11:44.663 --> 11:48.292
I mean, it's a big black
hole we live under here.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.045
What was the, uh- what was that you said?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.672
Jeter, he might be doin' steroids.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.673
No, no, no.
No. No.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.216
Not jeter.
The other thing.

11:56.251 --> 11:57.224
Palestinians.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.760
- I heard it on the internet.
- No. No.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.304
Middle thing.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.764
The lou thing.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.350
The lou thing?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.188
Our lou?

12:12.816 --> 12:15.235
Where's lou?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.654
He's in the kitchen.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.796
- Talk to needles?
- Yeah.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.124
He tell you about the david caruso thing?

12:29.166 --> 12:30.674
What?

12:30.709 --> 12:34.588
I was watchin', um, tv the other night,
csi: Miami, you know, and it hits me.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.466
You know, during the opening
credits with all those

12:37.508 --> 12:39.933
- fast cuts and that song by the who playin'.
- Yes.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.679
And it hits me like a goddamn brick
right in the middle of the head.

12:42.714 --> 12:44.348
I can't believe I never saw it before.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.184
I mean, david caruso, tommy garrity.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.692
You two are like twins.

12:48.727 --> 12:54.441
Only, instead of the sexy,
dynamic, crime-fightin' twin,

12:54.483 --> 12:57.903
I get stuck with the complete
self-centered asshole twin

12:57.945 --> 12:59.488
who's supposed to be my best friend, but

12:59.530 --> 13:01.198
how the hell is he supposed
to be my best friend when

13:01.240 --> 13:05.285
I'm gettin' married to-to the woman that
I love, a-and I have to think of a way

13:05.327 --> 13:07.211
to not only have him not be my best man,

13:07.246 --> 13:09.373
but to have him not come to
the goddamn wedding at all.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.291
- Ok, I am so-
- Just shut your face, tommy, all right?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.378
Just shut your fat irish mouth right now.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:17.374 --> 13:18.841
You guys ok?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.300
- No.
- No.

13:20.342 --> 13:23.011
Ok. Uh, maybe we should, uh¡ª

13:23.053 --> 13:24.805
- Get out.
- Get out.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.445
So I'm the asshole here?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.447
Right?Is that the-that's what the-

13:35.482 --> 13:39.757
because I deem, in all my assholishness,

13:39.792 --> 13:44.032
to tell my friend the goddamn truth, right?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.201
Deign.
Not "deem," deign.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.378
You deign to tell me the truth.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.916
You lean down from your perch on high,

13:52.958 --> 13:56.587
and you whisper the goddamn truth
to your merry little minions.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.296
Yeah.

13:57.337 --> 14:02.050
All the little asshole fools that
make up the kingdom of tommy the great.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.137
You know what, tommy?
I know. I know the truth.

14:05.179 --> 14:06.555
She was a whore, ok?

14:06.597 --> 14:10.142
Yeah. And how does that make
her any different than you, huh?

14:10.177 --> 14:12.728
She was a whore because
she saw what she wanted

14:12.763 --> 14:14.229
and she went and she took it,

14:14.271 --> 14:16.648
and how is that any different than you?

14:16.690 --> 14:19.359
Chasing your goddamn
cousin's wife into the sack

14:19.401 --> 14:21.945
under the guise of-of 9/11

14:21.987 --> 14:24.364
or some shared experience with that day.

14:24.399 --> 14:27.166
343 of our brothers perish.

14:27.201 --> 14:29.077
They disappear into a cloud of smoke,

14:29.119 --> 14:32.664
including your own flesh and blood.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.544
And your reaction is to bang his wife.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.589
I mean, what's that about?

14:40.631 --> 14:42.966
Or is it just that, you
know, your own marriage

14:43.008 --> 14:45.135
had deteriorated to the point where

14:45.177 --> 14:47.721
you were this self-centered
father who was drunk all the time

14:47.763 --> 14:49.813
so your wife didn't wanna sleep with you, so

14:49.848 --> 14:52.941
you went, and you, uh, decided
to bang that gorgeous brown ass

14:52.976 --> 14:58.440
that you'd probably been secretly coveting
the entire time jimmy keefe was alive.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.496
Thou shalt not steal,

15:05.531 --> 15:08.200
that was the commandment that candy broke.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.077
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife,

15:10.118 --> 15:12.078
that was the one you broke.

15:12.113 --> 15:14.039
She did it to pay the rent.

15:14.081 --> 15:18.043
You did it just to get
your goddamn rocks off.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.587
That's, uh...

15:42.150 --> 15:43.944
You like-you like that?

16:06.967 --> 16:08.760
I- I swear to god- You son of-

16:08.802 --> 16:10.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey!

16:10.255 --> 16:11.221
- Get off!
- Lou, lou, lou.

16:11.263 --> 16:11.645
Lou, stop!

16:11.680 --> 16:12.514
Chill.
Chill, man. Chill.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.473
- Jesus christ, that's enough.
- Come on. Come on.

16:13.515 --> 16:14.975
Get up.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.393
Relax.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.985
- God.
- Jesus christ.

16:18.020 --> 16:18.944
What the hell took you so long?

16:18.979 --> 16:20.647
Yeah. Where'd you guys come in from, canada,

16:20.689 --> 16:22.107
- for christ's sake?
- Jesus christ.

16:22.142 --> 16:23.525
We could have killed each other in here.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.611
- You all right, asshole?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.244
- You?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.239
What the hell is goin' on in here?!

16:29.274 --> 16:30.372
He ate all the oreos.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.284
I bought all the goddamn oreos.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.498
Well, do you want us to get more oreos or-

16:37.533 --> 16:39.958
No, just get the hell out.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.585
Not you.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.798
- Get out!
- They're gone.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.697
All right, look,

16:49.732 --> 16:52.054
here's the deal.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.767
Tommy's gonna come to my
wedding as my best man.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.151
If anything happens,

16:59.186 --> 17:02.356
you're gonna step in as the buffer.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.023
- The buffer?Whoa, whoa.
- Wait a minute.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.359
If this means I gotta blow a guy,
you count me the hell out right now.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.945
No. No, no, no.
That's a fluffer, asshole, ok?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.280
All right, look, tommy comes to the wedding.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.329
He does one negative thing,

17:11.365 --> 17:14.583
one wiseass look, one
snide, sarcastic comment,

17:14.617 --> 17:18.413
anything, he steps out as best
man, and you step in as the buffer.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.707
- Like a pinch hitter?
- Exactly. You're on deck.

17:20.742 --> 17:24.920
- Deal?
- Yeah. Deal.

17:24.954 --> 17:26.345
So...

17:26.380 --> 17:28.799
- we good?
- No, we're not good.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.280
I've got so much roiling,

17:31.315 --> 17:33.720
simmering hatred for you from

17:33.762 --> 17:37.266
so many years of so much shit that I'm
just gonna put a sock in it right now.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.019
Although, I gotta tell you, be honest.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.480
I
- I really can't blame you for the sheila thing.

17:43.515 --> 17:47.150
I mean, there's one gorgeous woman.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.367
You gotta blow the caterer.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.413
Clean up the kitchen, gavin.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.173
Hi.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.321
What are you doin' here?

18:12.356 --> 18:14.136
Damian couldn't make it.

18:14.178 --> 18:16.075
hey, check, please.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.973
All right, calm down.

18:18.015 --> 18:19.057
Look, I don't know what your angle is,

18:19.099 --> 18:20.726
but number one, i don't date married guys,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.269
number 2, you're way too old for me,

18:22.311 --> 18:26.148
and number 3, 2 words I
believe I've already mentioned-

18:26.190 --> 18:27.865
ron howard.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.408
Thanks.
I'm not eating.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.986
Bring another vodka with the check.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.032
Where's the kid?

18:35.073 --> 18:39.203
Ok, the kid is my godson,
as well as my probie.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.663
He just got out of the academy.
He's barely old enough to drink.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.249
He was livin' with his mom
until about a month ago.

18:44.284 --> 18:46.967
He started shaving this year.
He's a baby.

18:47.002 --> 18:50.297
Yes, which means he will happily
do whatever I tell him to in bed

18:50.339 --> 18:53.425
and be ready to do it all over
again in less than a half-hour.

18:53.467 --> 18:54.968
Remember those days?

18:55.010 --> 18:57.513
Hey, I don't get any complaints
in that department, sister.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.688
That must be why your wife is divorcing you.

18:59.723 --> 19:03.525
My wife is not divorcing me
because of any sexual things.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.897
No, she's divorcing you because
you're a lying, cheating alcoholic.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.859
Mike told me right before
he sang his little song.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.446
What's your cutoff age?

19:14.488 --> 19:17.157
- Let me guess. 24.
- I don't discriminate.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.742
Age is not really an obstacle.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.370
Christ, I dated mick
jagger for almost 5 weeks.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.331
- Did you sleep with him?
- No.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.750
- Why?
- Why do you think?

19:26.785 --> 19:28.509
He's goddamn ancient.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.463
I mean, he's got the body
of a jonas brother, but the

19:31.505 --> 19:33.549
face, more like a smothers brother.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.760
So what was in the, uh, box?

19:37.386 --> 19:38.720
What?

19:38.762 --> 19:42.933
The box that you basically put your
life on the line to run in and rescue.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.726
Personal stuff.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.020
Sentimental stuff,

19:47.062 --> 19:50.023
just a couple of bowie
albums from the seventies,

19:50.058 --> 19:53.527
some photos, plus my weed.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.946
- Your weed?
- And my paraphernalia.

19:55.988 --> 19:58.407
The vaporizer cost me a small fortune.

19:59.116 --> 20:02.494
You ran into a burning building to
- to save weed?

20:02.529 --> 20:03.745
It's good weed.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.415
It's-jesus christ.
Must be the greatest weed ever.

20:06.450 --> 20:08.375
- You smoke?
- No, I-I'm a fireman.

20:08.417 --> 20:12.004
I'm a public servant, ok?
I'm drug-free.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.632
Besides, I-you know, I was-I think
marijuana just makes people, you know,

20:15.674 --> 20:17.975
- delusional.
- Oh, really?How?

20:18.010 --> 20:22.181
Well, for one example, it makes
willie nelson think he can act.

20:22.216 --> 20:24.022
Let me tell you something.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.976
This weed is so good, willie nelson

20:26.018 --> 20:28.896
would be doin' shakespeare
in the park after one hit.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.815
I changed my mind.
Let's leave it open.

20:31.857 --> 20:35.027
And why don't you bring us, um-

20:35.068 --> 20:36.236
what do you drink?

20:36.278 --> 20:40.407
Uh, it would actually be easier
for me to list what I don't drink.

20:41.366 --> 20:45.078
Bring us a bottle of your best tequila.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.479
You know, you've got a-a thing,

20:50.514 --> 20:53.587
like a triangle in your left eye.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.970
Yes.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.007
It's kind of like bowie.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.384
You know, he has those
2 different-colored eyes.

20:59.419 --> 21:01.935
One of 'em's a-is a strange shape.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.014
Yeah, he-he's probably too old for you.

21:04.049 --> 21:06.058
Oh, no, not him.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.770
I would knock him on out cold if I
got within 10 feet of david bowie.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.981
He could be usin' a walker, and I would just

21:13.023 --> 21:15.734
fold it up and do him.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.828
What?

21:19.863 --> 21:22.991
You got kind of a david
bowie thing goin' on.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.334
What?

21:25.369 --> 21:29.790
Well, I walk in here, and i supposedly look
like I just came off the set of happy days,

21:29.832 --> 21:33.085
and then a couple of drinks later, I'm

21:33.126 --> 21:35.921
an aging british rock star.

21:35.963 --> 21:38.215
Maybe I could smoke some of
that ganja I got in the box

21:38.250 --> 21:40.801
and turn you into goddamn george clooney.

21:40.843 --> 21:42.935
You know, I came down here

21:42.970 --> 21:46.807
to just try to make sure that
you kept your paws off my godson.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.440
I came here to broaden his horizons.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.270
You came down here to get him
shitfaced and bang his brains out.

21:51.305 --> 21:53.195
6 of 1...

21:53.230 --> 21:56.525
- I'm 45 years old.
- Bowie's 62.

21:56.567 --> 21:59.117
Listen, I know myself well
enough at this point in my life.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.822
We're gonna sit here. We're gonna
go shot for shot for about an hour,

22:01.864 --> 22:03.866
probably laugh our asses off while we do it,

22:03.907 --> 22:06.285
and then pretty soon, I'm gonna
start twistin' it around in my mind

22:06.326 --> 22:09.642
what you might be like in the sack,
and if we end up sharing a cab home,

22:09.677 --> 22:12.958
I will probably make the first move,
and then we'll be makin' out like mad.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.300
And because we're in a cab,
there'll be a stranger there,

22:15.335 --> 22:18.297
so it'll be kind of dangerous.
And once we get to my apartment,

22:18.338 --> 22:20.055
my common sense will have kicked back in,

22:20.090 --> 22:23.719
and both of us will end up just
going home alone. You wanna know why?

22:24.553 --> 22:27.639
Because I'm not david bowie.

22:29.808 --> 22:32.067
Mm, you could be.

22:32.102 --> 22:34.646
Told you it's really good weed.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.736
Muchas gracias.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.031
Well...

22:45.741 --> 22:48.035
Let the games begin.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.625
- It wasn't a date.
- Oh.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.585
It wasn'T.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.679
It was damian's date.

23:00.714 --> 23:04.009
I w- I was-I went down there to-

23:04.051 --> 23:06.435
I went down there a-as his godfather,

23:06.470 --> 23:09.598
and I should be getting
credit for that, not being

23:09.633 --> 23:11.266
cross-examined about it.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.810
This chick-first of all, she- she's crazy.

23:13.845 --> 23:15.319
She drinks like a fish,

23:15.354 --> 23:17.773
and she's, you know, a rock chick.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.067
I- that's not even in my wheelhouse.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.280
Aging.
Did I say aging rock chick?

23:25.315 --> 23:27.449
Because she was.
She-she is.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.660
Is she aging?

23:29.701 --> 23:31.703
Yes, she is.
She's aged. Aged.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.080
- Aged.
- Yes.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.624
She makes chrissie hynde look like, uh,

23:35.666 --> 23:37.007
carrie underwood.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.711
Damian said she's about my age

23:39.753 --> 23:42.172
and that she kinda looks like me.

23:42.214 --> 23:45.133
Yeah. He was here for his
thursday-night laundry-dinner thing.

23:45.168 --> 23:47.761
Ok.
Everybody looks old to him.

23:47.803 --> 23:51.390
He's, you know-how many women has he known?

23:51.425 --> 23:52.933
When are you gonna learn...

23:52.975 --> 23:56.478
- Ok.
- That you cannot lie to me?!

23:56.520 --> 23:58.313
I'm not-

23:58.355 --> 24:01.650
- forget it.
- Look, she looks like me, ok?

24:01.692 --> 24:04.820
"She's crazy," which I
happen to know that you like.

24:04.855 --> 24:06.905
And she drinks like a fish.

24:06.947 --> 24:07.990
Let me guess.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.993
You met up with a genie on the
street, and he granted your 3 wishes.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.536
- Huh?Is that right?
- You're so funny.

24:12.578 --> 24:13.620
I can drink, too, you know.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.790
Yeah. I-I drink a lot of-
all the time by myself.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.091
Whatever.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.919
You, whatever.

24:22.921 --> 24:26.175
You know, I-it's-I can't win.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.343
- I try to tell the truth.
- Oh, my god.

24:28.385 --> 24:32.431
- What?
- Hamlet, shakespeare.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.107
Hamlet. Sweetheart- Mother-son thing.

24:35.142 --> 24:38.395
You know, these classics,
for me, it's raging bull,

24:38.437 --> 24:41.280
you know, it's on the
waterfront, annie hall.

24:41.315 --> 24:44.985
I
- I don't think anybody in any of those movies ever slept with their own mother.

24:45.027 --> 24:47.487
I'm-woody allen married his
own daughter. Does that count?

24:47.522 --> 24:49.781
Damian,

24:49.823 --> 24:51.874
me-

24:51.909 --> 24:54.661
like, you think that he
wants to sleep with his own¡ª

24:56.830 --> 24:59.082
That's what hamlet's about?

24:59.124 --> 25:00.834
Jesus christ.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.566
Can't believe scorsese hasn't made that.

25:03.601 --> 25:05.589
Oh, my god.
Would you please be serious.

25:05.624 --> 25:07.799
It is a real psychological complex.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.260
I think you're overreacting,
but look at the bright side.

25:10.302 --> 25:11.512
If it doesn't work out between me and you,

25:11.553 --> 25:13.096
you don't have to join
an online dating service.

25:13.131 --> 25:13.729
You can just...

25:13.764 --> 25:14.389
- You want a spanking?
- Wait for laundry night...

25:14.424 --> 25:15.724
- Do you want a spanking?
- To come around.

25:15.766 --> 25:16.808
I'm kidding.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.561
I don't know how to
relate to the conversation,

25:19.603 --> 25:21.480
being attracted to your own mother. I mean,

25:21.522 --> 25:23.315
I'd have to wanna jump in the sack with-

25:23.357 --> 25:26.735
I don't know
- cloris leachman just to match up.

25:28.153 --> 25:32.574
I'm sure it's your over- what?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.626
No, I just-I think that's really weird

25:35.661 --> 25:39.081
that you just kinda plucked
cloris leachman out of thin air.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.959
I didn't pluck her out
of thin air. She's been-

25:42.000 --> 25:43.585
she was all-on television. Like,

25:43.627 --> 25:45.024
she was on dancing with the stars.

25:45.059 --> 25:46.386
So I had to pick an old broad,

25:46.421 --> 25:48.444
I picked the first old
broad that came to mind.

25:48.479 --> 25:50.467
No, no. She was really
hot when she was young,

25:50.509 --> 25:52.386
well into her 40s and 50s,

25:52.427 --> 25:54.346
- when she was on the mary tyler moore show.
- Yes, she was.

25:54.388 --> 25:56.765
Hot and funny, which is double hot.

25:56.807 --> 25:59.539
Yeah, you know, your mom
looked like cloris leachman.

25:59.574 --> 26:02.271
I know. My mom used to watch
the show, too. She loved it.

26:02.306 --> 26:05.440
- What's your point?
- Tall, blonde...

26:05.482 --> 26:06.900
- Yep.
- Cheekbone city.

26:06.942 --> 26:10.404
My mom was the cloris leachman of real life.

26:10.445 --> 26:13.615
You married your mother

26:13.657 --> 26:16.125
- What?
- You did.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.663
- Honey, janet...
- Yeah.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.082
- Cloris...
- Yeah.

26:22.117 --> 26:24.084
Mommy.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.253
- No.
- Yeah.

26:26.288 --> 26:27.880
- No.
- Yes.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.048
I will get up on that internet, and I will

26:30.090 --> 26:33.218
google cloris leachman circa 1977.

26:33.253 --> 26:33.969
Well, go ahead.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.597
Well- I'll dig up-you got a picture
of janet layin' around the apartment?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.265
I- we'll match 'em up.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.892
I got one in my fireplace.

26:45.731 --> 26:48.400
Don't google that.
Hang on. Shit.

26:48.435 --> 26:49.735
Wait.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.945
Oh, you are such a cliche.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.164
Janet was a classic choice for you.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.660
You know, she strolls in with her
long legs and her long blonde hair,

26:58.702 --> 27:01.295
and you were hooked, blinded

27:01.330 --> 27:05.083
to every other single offering out there.
Trust me. I should know.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.919
What's that supposed to mean?

27:08.545 --> 27:11.173
You had your chance with me.

27:11.215 --> 27:13.175
Ok.
When?

27:16.303 --> 27:19.104
July 4,

27:19.139 --> 27:21.523
- summer of '85.
- Oh, god.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.853
I was not dating jimmy yet, but
you were already seeing janet,

27:24.895 --> 27:27.397
except you guys had some
huge blowout, so she went away

27:27.439 --> 27:30.317
to the beach with her family for a week,

27:30.352 --> 27:33.160
so I asked you to the movies one night,

27:33.195 --> 27:36.073
and then I asked you to
dinner the next night,

27:36.108 --> 27:38.926
and then I cooked for
you for the next 2 nights,

27:38.961 --> 27:41.745
and it was just like so
much fun. We were so giddy,

27:41.787 --> 27:44.039
and we're laughing and drinking, and

27:44.081 --> 27:46.291
we kept makin' plans for
each night as we went along,

27:46.333 --> 27:48.842
and my skirts kept getting
shorter and shorter,

27:48.877 --> 27:51.547
and then by the end of the
week, I was wearing these tiny,

27:51.588 --> 27:54.466
- little cutoffs with my ass...
- Cutoffs with your ass peeking out.

27:54.501 --> 27:56.510
Yeah.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.346
I remember.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.974
I remember the cutoffs.

28:02.009 --> 28:04.560
I remember the ass.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.814
I remember that night,
'cause we went down to

28:08.856 --> 28:12.366
lombardi's by the beach to get

28:12.401 --> 28:16.655
some soft-serve ice cream, and
we stopped at the liquor store,

28:16.697 --> 28:18.365
bought a bottle of vodka,

28:18.407 --> 28:20.513
and we sat,

28:20.548 --> 28:22.619
and we drank,

28:22.661 --> 28:24.288
and we talked,

28:24.329 --> 28:27.791
and then I tore off your top,

28:27.833 --> 28:32.629
and I laid you down in
the sand, and I kissed you,

28:32.671 --> 28:38.725
and i wanted to tear you
to pieces that night, but

28:38.760 --> 28:43.640
when I went to peel down
those tiny, little cutoffs, you

28:43.675 --> 28:45.475
said you had to be home.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.145
Your parents were waitin' up or...

28:48.896 --> 28:51.023
somethin'.

28:58.989 --> 29:02.284
I didn't have to be home.

29:07.498 --> 29:09.458
Uh, you actually just-

29:09.500 --> 29:12.190
you scared the shit out of me that night.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.845
You-you had this look in your eye, and

29:14.880 --> 29:17.633
when we were at the liquor
store, there was that guy outside.

29:17.674 --> 29:21.678
He, like, glanced at me, and
you punched him in the face.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.180
We went down to the boardwalk,
and then you just, like,

29:23.222 --> 29:25.224
grabbed my hand and led me away.

29:25.265 --> 29:29.561
Yeah. The guy who was staring at your ass.

29:29.603 --> 29:36.068
It was, uh, incredibly
sudden and violent, and, uh,

29:36.103 --> 29:37.778
it's like I didn't know

29:37.819 --> 29:40.537
what you were thinking or
what you were gonna do next.

29:40.572 --> 29:43.158
You know, one minute, we're
buyin' booze, and the next minute,

29:43.200 --> 29:47.746
some random guy's nose is exploding
blood all over the goddamn beach.

29:47.781 --> 29:49.748
All right, the guy had it coming, ok?

29:49.790 --> 29:51.708
- Jimmy would have done the same thing.
- No.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.460
Jimmy would not have done the sa-he would-

29:53.502 --> 29:55.170
yes, he would have stood up for me,

29:55.212 --> 29:56.845
but he would have talked to the guy,

29:56.880 --> 29:59.383
and then we would have
walked away, nobody gets hurt.

29:59.424 --> 30:03.011
He would have done the right
thing minus the drama, ok?

30:03.053 --> 30:06.577
I needed somebody like jimmy,

30:06.612 --> 30:10.067
who was solid and dependable,

30:10.102 --> 30:13.981
and I knew that I wanted to get
married and get settled down,

30:14.022 --> 30:16.712
and you were just like-

30:16.747 --> 30:19.701
you were too much trouble.

30:19.736 --> 30:22.656
You were too much like me,

30:22.698 --> 30:26.743
and i married jimmy

30:26.785 --> 30:29.621
because he wasn't like me.

30:29.663 --> 30:32.708
He was calm.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.675
He was careful,

30:34.710 --> 30:41.014
and he was gentle, and he was sweet.

30:41.049 --> 30:46.680
I mean, you know, he was really sweet
up until the time when he cheated on me.

30:46.722 --> 30:49.766
I know.
Weird.

30:49.808 --> 30:52.102
He had an affair, and I found out

30:52.144 --> 30:55.355
a year before he died.

30:55.397 --> 31:01.069
We hadn't had sex or
touched at all in, like, um,

31:01.111 --> 31:03.280
14 months.

31:03.322 --> 31:04.364
Shit, I di-I-

31:04.406 --> 31:07.910
See, right now, too much trouble,

31:07.951 --> 31:09.912
that works for me,

31:09.953 --> 31:13.255
and I know that it works for you.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.584
All this shit that we've been through,

31:15.626 --> 31:21.798
all of this shit, we can just keep
it at bay by havin' a good time.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.759
Don't we have a good time?

31:23.794 --> 31:26.512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:26.553 --> 31:31.266
'Cause we drink and kiss,

31:31.308 --> 31:35.979
and we screw, and we survive.

31:36.563 --> 31:43.320
Look, jimmy may have been the best
thing that ever happened to me until-

31:43.362 --> 31:49.993
and, uh, janet probably was the
best thing that ever happened to you

31:50.035 --> 31:53.664
until you realized that
you married your mommy.

31:53.705 --> 31:57.417
I did not marry my-

31:58.168 --> 32:01.296
We have each other to fall back on now.

32:01.338 --> 32:04.216
Plan "B."

32:05.968 --> 32:08.887
Don't forget about my leaky sink.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.403
I didn't marry my mom!

32:32.077 --> 32:33.954
Hey.

32:37.541 --> 32:39.633
Listen.
That-that, uh-

32:39.668 --> 32:41.468
that shit she was talkin'
about at the beach-

32:41.503 --> 32:45.883
No, no, no. She-she told me
about it long, long time ago.

32:45.924 --> 32:48.427
Gotta admit, cuz-heh heh heh.

32:48.468 --> 32:51.096
You are a goddamn caveman.

32:51.138 --> 32:52.890
That's funny.

32:53.724 --> 32:55.517
Especially comin' from, uh,

32:55.559 --> 32:59.104
captain calm, mr. Dependable over here.

32:59.146 --> 33:01.398
Ah, you're right. That was me,

33:01.440 --> 33:05.360
mr. Always where I was supposed to be,

33:07.446 --> 33:09.740
even on september 11.

33:10.532 --> 33:14.495
Aw, maybe that's why the marriage gave way.

33:14.536 --> 33:18.749
Maybe she was just bored of me.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.718
Hell, when I was on the wagon,

33:22.753 --> 33:25.464
I even bored the shit out of myself.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.343
Who'd you sleep with?

33:31.053 --> 33:32.930
Don't you worry about it.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.062
All right.

33:40.103 --> 33:42.105
Was it, uh-ahem.

33:43.398 --> 33:45.526
Was it someone I knew?

33:52.032 --> 33:53.784
I'm gonna put some cabbage in the jukebox.

33:53.826 --> 33:55.619
You do that.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.956
Give me another drink, prince charming.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.374
Hey, faggots.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.217
It's a pleasant little wedding party.

34:03.252 --> 34:05.969
Think we could time it so
they vomit during the vows?

34:06.004 --> 34:10.967
Theodore, play the one by the
dropkick murphys that I like, ok?!

34:11.009 --> 34:12.768
- Hey, tommy.
- Tommy.

34:12.803 --> 34:14.346
Well, look who decided to show up.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.639
I wouldn't miss this for
all the whiskey in ireland.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.433
We're gonna need it to
keep feedin' these animals.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.565
Yeah.
What are they still doin' here?

34:19.601 --> 34:21.770
I tried to eighty-six
'em, but they won't leave.

34:21.812 --> 34:24.147
Kid, come here, you.
Get out.

34:24.982 --> 34:27.045
Can you just-can't you
just get rid of them, tommy?

34:27.081 --> 34:29.110
Aw, they'll be kissin'
and cryin' in 3 minutes.

34:29.152 --> 34:30.904
Come here.
Come here.

34:32.614 --> 34:34.081
Irish calisthenics.

34:34.116 --> 34:36.577
Hey, they're your goddamn family.
Get 'em the hell out of here, will ya?

34:36.618 --> 34:38.495
Candy's in the back gettin'
her wedding dress on.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.956
Yeah, or tryin' to crack the safe.

34:40.998 --> 34:43.583
Hey, you're supposed to be
the goddamn buffer, asshole.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.085
Hey, enough, tommy, all right?

34:45.127 --> 34:46.587
You're supposed to be the goddamn best man.

34:46.628 --> 34:46.920
I got it.

34:46.962 --> 34:48.846
You should be standin'
up for lou, all right?

34:48.880 --> 34:51.507
So don't be shittin' all over
this, no matter how stupid it is.

34:51.543 --> 34:53.886
A man's entitled to make
his own dumb mistakes.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.846
You know, you really kind
of suck at bein' a buffer.

34:55.888 --> 34:59.349
- It's my first day.
- My lips are sealed.

34:59.850 --> 35:02.102
Pour me another pint, you whores.

35:02.137 --> 35:04.354
Will you please get rid of them?

35:04.389 --> 35:05.772
They're runnin' a tab.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.733
They haven't paid for a
goddamn drink all night.

35:07.768 --> 35:09.669
Irish accounting.

35:09.704 --> 35:11.429
I got an idea.

35:11.464 --> 35:13.155
Watch this.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.415
All right, assholes, listen up!

35:23.457 --> 35:25.924
- Hey!
- Ho!

35:25.959 --> 35:28.712
You wanna stay, you gotta pay, all right?

35:28.754 --> 35:29.880
No more tabs.

35:29.922 --> 35:32.591
Cash on the bar, or you walk out the door.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.801
Watch this.

35:37.304 --> 35:40.307
I wrestled in high school,
but just until I came.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.653
Aw, who knew?

35:46.688 --> 35:48.065
All right, lou, forget about them.

35:48.106 --> 35:50.567
This is your wedding day, pal.
This is a happy day.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.444
Yeah.
Where is candy?

35:52.486 --> 35:54.571
Is that a drill I hear?

35:54.606 --> 35:55.864
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:55.899 --> 35:56.698
Hey.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.742
Ok, if we can get the,
uh, little lady out here,

35:58.777 --> 36:00.702
we can sign everything and, uh,

36:00.744 --> 36:03.789
- begin the beguine.
- Yeah. Let's begin the beguine.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.425
What the hell was that all about?

36:08.460 --> 36:11.964
That's the justice of the
peace and a notary public.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.007
Turns out candy's got money.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.133
She's got lou's money.

36:15.175 --> 36:17.678
No. She's got a lot more than lou's money.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.973
She's got an uncle who made a tidy,
little bundle in the plumbing business.

36:21.008 --> 36:24.768
Then he gets poleaxed by his prostate,

36:24.810 --> 36:28.897
leaves about $2 million to be whacked up
among his 3 daughters and favorite niece.

36:28.932 --> 36:31.365
Candy's take, about 250 large.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.694
Holy shit.
So she's payin' lou back.

36:33.735 --> 36:35.077
In blow jobs, maybe.

36:35.112 --> 36:37.114
This is a prenup they're signin'.

36:37.156 --> 36:39.908
They both decided to leave
with what they came in with,

36:39.950 --> 36:43.495
which in lou's case is a
cabinet full of bobblehead dolls

36:43.537 --> 36:45.372
and that cake.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.589
Is this legal?

36:47.624 --> 36:49.960
It is as long as they
sign it in front of me.

36:49.995 --> 36:51.461
It's not just legal.

36:51.503 --> 36:55.430
It's proof, proof that ken loves me.

36:55.465 --> 36:58.385
My father never did.
Neither did my mother.

36:58.427 --> 37:02.264
My uncle, he was different, like ken,

37:02.890 --> 37:04.474
so when he willed this money to me,

37:04.516 --> 37:07.477
it gave me a chance to start my life over,

37:07.519 --> 37:12.774
and the only sweet man I ever
knew besides my uncle was ken.

37:14.026 --> 37:16.737
That's why I came back to him.

37:16.778 --> 37:21.533
I thought he might still
have the same feelings for me.

37:21.575 --> 37:23.535
And I did.

37:23.577 --> 37:25.787
After, you know, a couple days.

37:26.497 --> 37:28.936
Yes, 4 to be exact.

37:28.971 --> 37:31.341
Yes.
4.4 days.

37:31.376 --> 37:34.358
So 4 days, then you
told him about the money?

37:34.393 --> 37:37.341
No, she told me about
the money thursday night.

37:37.382 --> 37:41.094
I guess she just, uh, wanted to be sure.

37:41.129 --> 37:43.931
Yeah, it was kinda like a test.

37:45.349 --> 37:48.393
One that ken passed with flying colors.

37:59.947 --> 38:01.740
All right.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.119
Well, here are the rings.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.331
I can't do this.

38:09.366 --> 38:10.916
You take 'em.

38:10.958 --> 38:13.043
- I can't do it.
- You take 'em.

38:13.085 --> 38:15.295
- I don't want the rings.
- Take 'em.

38:15.330 --> 38:16.547
No.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.944
Want me to call immigration?

38:18.979 --> 38:21.301
Give me the goddamn rings.

38:22.177 --> 38:24.012
- See you over there.
- Stop smiling.

38:33.939 --> 38:34.648
Aw, christ.
All right.

38:34.690 --> 38:36.108
All right, enough.
Enough. Right.

38:36.149 --> 38:37.776
Thank you, my brothers.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.197
He's so happy.

38:42.239 --> 38:43.991
This is too much.
So this is your idea of low-key?

38:44.032 --> 38:45.701
It's not his fault.
I beat it out of him.

38:45.736 --> 38:47.167
Congratulations, lou.

38:47.202 --> 38:49.288
Second time around is the charm.

38:49.329 --> 38:50.664
- Third time, actually.
- Shut up.

38:50.706 --> 38:52.145
- Hey, congrats, lou.
- Thank you.

38:52.180 --> 38:53.549
- What's with the car?
- It's funny.

38:53.584 --> 38:55.836
A buddy of mine's got a volkswagen
dealership out in jersey,

38:55.878 --> 38:57.136
and he gave us a month's free lease,

38:57.171 --> 38:59.882
and we've been luggin' around
mike's band's equipment for a while,

38:59.923 --> 39:02.134
but we decided it'd be better if you
guys could have it for the weekend, so-

39:02.169 --> 39:06.054
by the way, gets good gas
mileage, and the interior is huge,

39:06.096 --> 39:07.431
in case you decide to
pull over and, you know,

39:07.466 --> 39:09.683
start the honeymoon a little early...

39:09.725 --> 39:11.101
On the way to the hotel.

39:11.143 --> 39:12.519
All right.
Well, nice seein' you all.

39:12.561 --> 39:14.062
Let's go.
Get outta here!

39:14.980 --> 39:16.190
Have fun.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.573
Get outta here!

39:17.608 --> 39:19.485
Go make some babies.

39:25.157 --> 39:27.409
Guys, tell me, uh,

39:27.451 --> 39:29.912
you know, I'm not, uh-

39:29.953 --> 39:31.371
I'm not makin' a mistake with this.

39:33.582 --> 39:35.876
Yeah.
It's gonna be great.

39:35.918 --> 39:37.419
- Oh, christ.
- All right, drive safe.

39:37.461 --> 39:39.463
- All right. We'll be thinkin' of you.
- Get outta here.

39:39.505 --> 39:40.547
Thank you.

39:40.589 --> 39:42.549
- Bye-bye.
- Buckle up.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.635
Precious cargo. Don't
forget about the blue laws.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.803
- Oh ho ho!
- Yes!

39:48.514 --> 39:50.182
- So long.
- Bye!

39:56.438 --> 39:58.273
10 to 1, it doesn't last a year.

39:58.315 --> 40:00.943
A year?I don't give 'em
to the end of the block.

40:02.319 --> 40:03.779
I'll take some of that action.

40:04.446 --> 40:06.365
You want a piece of this, sittin' bull?

40:08.075 --> 40:09.910
He don't even understand the bet.

40:09.952 --> 40:11.168
What kinda injun are you?

40:11.203 --> 40:13.309
He's a brain-dead one.
Come on.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.415
Let's go finish up the firewater.

40:16.583 --> 40:19.711
Ah, we sent your parents off like this.

40:19.746 --> 40:21.755
Well, almost like this.

40:21.797 --> 40:23.006
'Cept back then,

40:23.048 --> 40:26.677
the red man didn't have casinos,
so we sent 'em down to A.C.

40:26.712 --> 40:28.220
Instead of a rent-a-car,

40:28.262 --> 40:31.098
we scraped up a couple
bucks to get 'em bus tickets.

40:31.139 --> 40:36.436
But you know, they were
fall-off-their-feet in love with each other,

40:36.471 --> 40:38.438
true soul mates.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.357
Yeah.

40:40.399 --> 40:44.570
I tell you it was really
somethin' to see, kid, beautiful.

40:44.605 --> 40:47.030
Just amazing, right, t?

40:48.115 --> 40:50.499
Yep.

40:50.534 --> 40:53.537
- Now let's go get shattered!
- Hell, yeah.
