WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:06.240
[theme music]

00:55.923 --> 00:58.526
Well, we're going to
be at Grandma's by 2:00,

00:58.559 --> 00:59.727
unless we get
really lucky and we

00:59.760 --> 01:02.163
get into a head-on collision.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.532
Wouldn't it be great
if the roads were closed

01:04.565 --> 01:06.600
and we couldn't get through?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.637
I'll go get some road snacks.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.072
OK, Becky, I left Grandma's
number on the corkboard.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.741
And if Darlene
ain't home by 4:30,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.042
I want you give me a call.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.044
Collect.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.180
Bye, Mother.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.614
Train leaving for
Oakridge Mall, Budget

01:20.648 --> 01:22.015
Club, and Moline, Illinois.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.251
Boarding on track 1.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.385
Have your tickets ready.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.886
I have to make it!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.855
I'm going to go
warm up the car.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.957
So you guys are going to
work on your history, huh?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.293
- Social studies.
- Oh, whatever.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.494
Well, you know,
your grandma's sure

01:33.527 --> 01:35.062
going to be disappointed
that you and Darlene

01:35.095 --> 01:35.963
aren't going to come.

01:35.996 --> 01:36.864
I can't help it, Mom.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.433
The paper is due next week.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.369
How come you're not
bringing the girls?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.137
Well, you know, I
don't like to expose

01:43.171 --> 01:44.605
them to Mom too often.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.640
It's kind of like radiation.

01:46.674 --> 01:50.110
Let's go.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.312
Where you going?

01:51.345 --> 01:53.947
To get the coffee.

01:53.981 --> 01:57.251
I'm going to go
make a pit stop.

01:57.285 --> 02:00.688
So you guys try not to
burn the house down, huh?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.290
And don't go anywhere
without calling Grandma,

02:02.323 --> 02:03.957
don't leave the lights
on in every room,

02:03.991 --> 02:05.326
turn the heat out
if you do leave,

02:05.359 --> 02:07.395
and the chocolate pudding in
the little cans is off-limits

02:07.428 --> 02:09.730
because they're for DJ's lunch.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.764
That about cover it?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.233
BOTH: And call me
if Darlene's late.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.840
So where do you want to work--
the kitchen or the living room?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.775
How about the mall?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.411
Well, it's more comfortable
in the living room,

02:23.444 --> 02:24.945
but the light's
better in the kitchen.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.946
Can we hear the stereo?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.047
Oh, definitely.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.783
Good, because I can't
study without music.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.118
My brain stops.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.386
I know.

02:32.420 --> 02:36.357
It's really hard to concentrate
on one thing at a time.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.527
Don't think I'm
stupid or anything,

02:39.560 --> 02:43.864
but, like, what is
this project about?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.133
It's about us--
women in the '90s.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.736
Women of the '90s
or women in the '90s?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.438
I think it's women in
the '90s, because it's kind

02:50.471 --> 02:51.839
of a future thing.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.342
But wouldn't women in the '90s
mean, like, really old women?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.809
No, that would be
women in their 90s.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.012
OK.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.848
So then we're getting
into a grammar thing,

03:00.881 --> 03:02.082
and that's English.

03:02.115 --> 03:05.185
And I'm even worse in
English, so let's forget it.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.086
OK.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.521
Here's something we can use--

03:07.555 --> 03:10.891
a woman in a hard hat
doing construction.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.159
I like those
jeans she's wearing.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.227
Yeah.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.429
You know, they have
those at Rodville's.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.965
I wouldn't mind being a model.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.900
You stand around all
day looking perfect,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.635
and you get paid a fortune.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.704
Yeah, but you can't eat
anything, because you get fat.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.306
And you can't stay
out late, because you

03:25.339 --> 03:26.474
get bags under your eyes.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.141
Really?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.977
If I ever model, I
guess I'd have to become

03:30.010 --> 03:33.347
less of a party animal.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.016
Oh, right, like you're
a real party animal.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.618
Hey, I've had beer.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.553
When?

03:39.587 --> 03:40.921
Wrigley Field.

03:40.954 --> 03:41.889
That doesn't count.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.124
You were with your dad.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.927
OK.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.195
Billy Sparing.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.597
Get out of here.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.765
I had beer with him once.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.900
How much?

03:52.933 --> 03:56.203
More than you.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.040
Yeah, but I bet you've
never had a tornado.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.642
No, but I've heard of them.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.243
They're awesome.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.346
You ever had one?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.148
No, but I think I
know how to make one.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.418
Want to try one?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.387
Oh, I don't know.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.656
What's in it?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.291
Everything and juice.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.896
Oh, no, I think
we're out of juice.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.965
Well, can't you use soda?

04:24.998 --> 04:25.799
You're a genius.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.137
OK.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.873
It's 1:00 now.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.475
How long do we want to
work, considering this

04:34.508 --> 04:36.109
really isn't due for two weeks?

04:36.143 --> 04:38.111
Yeah, we still
have next weekend.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.448
How about we work till
3:00, then get to the mall

04:40.481 --> 04:41.349
where we belong?

04:41.382 --> 04:42.182
It's a plan.

04:53.494 --> 04:57.565
Are you going to have any?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.066
Yeah.

04:59.099 --> 04:59.900
Mine's right here.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.986
Go ahead.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.021
Well, you go first.

05:21.054 --> 05:21.922
But you're my guest.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.160
OK.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.430
We'll drink at the same time.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.031
Ready--

05:31.064 --> 05:32.433
Aim--

05:32.466 --> 05:33.266
Fire.

05:40.774 --> 05:45.879
(SLURRING) You know, I look
back at junior high now,

05:45.913 --> 05:47.415
and I just laugh.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.284
I know.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.053
It's scary.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.222
Check this out.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.257
This is what my
parents call trippy.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.663
OK, so get back to Jimmy.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.864
Oh, don't remind me.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.200
I don't want to talk about him.

06:07.234 --> 06:12.305
Two months of my
life down the toilet.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.707
Becky?

06:13.741 --> 06:16.544
Hmm?

06:16.577 --> 06:20.147
Are you aware
this room is moving?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.982
You're plowed.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.016
These are great.

06:23.050 --> 06:23.951
Told you.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.189
What's the matter?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.958
What's the matter?

06:30.991 --> 06:34.462
The room is moving.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.729
Yeah.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.932
Ain't it great?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.968
This music is scaring me.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.207
Whoa.

06:53.581 --> 06:58.552
My parents dig all those songs
from before music was invented.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.453
Mine, too.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.026
Have you ever heard
of Albert Herbert?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.063
He's from Tijuana.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.301
She opens the door.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.368
She closes the door.
She turns.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.369
She dribbles.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.738
She cuts through the key.
She spins.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.639
It's up.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.707
She steals her sister's soda.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.508
Hey!

07:25.112 --> 07:29.149
Ugh, that stuff
tastes like sock sweat.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.418
We're studying.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.587
How come the liquor
cabinet is open?

07:33.621 --> 07:36.356
I don't know.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.893
Maybe the wine had to breathe.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.797
You guys are drunk.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.433
It just happened.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.703
This is my sister, Lardene--

07:49.737 --> 07:53.974
Larlene-- Gardene.

07:54.007 --> 07:54.808
What?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.480
Where's the bathroom?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.415
We don't have a bathroom.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.216
We use a wok.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.870
Can't believe he
slept the whole way.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.712
I can't stand it anymore.

08:31.745 --> 08:35.382
Mom just sucks the life
blood right out of me.

08:35.415 --> 08:39.052
Next time I go back there
is when they come here.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.956
And what was that
smell in their house?

08:42.990 --> 08:45.626
Guilt.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.494
Thank god, we're back.

08:47.527 --> 08:52.199
62 slides, and all of
them taken from the car.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.534
And not one slide in focus.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.270
And who are all those people?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.106
It's like they're trying
to create the illusion

08:59.139 --> 09:02.142
that they have friends.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.510
How are the girls?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.745
Silent.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.114
Boy, you can hear it
across the whole state.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.283
Hey, I'd like to thank you,
honey, for not hitting my mom.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.653
Yeah, and I had such
a clean shot, too.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.798
How come you're still up?

09:24.832 --> 09:27.400
I heard Dad come up with DJ.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.236
Is Becky up, too?

09:29.269 --> 09:33.774
No, she's pretty much out.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.044
We humiliated St.
Mary's 38 to 26.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.347
And I got fouled three times
by this dippy blond kid

09:40.380 --> 09:41.414
from Wayland.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.315
Yeah?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.717
Did you make your shots?

09:43.751 --> 09:44.718
The first two.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.986
Then he asked me
for my phone number,

09:46.019 --> 09:48.588
and I blew the last one.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.390
Psyched you out, huh?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.292
I guess.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.494
Well, you go on to bed now.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.495
Good night.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.429
Good night.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.935
[whistling]

10:46.179 --> 10:49.249
One good frolic in three weeks
and you're acting like Ben-Hur.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.956
Yeah, well, I really got
that old chariot rocking.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.993
You making pancakes?

11:00.027 --> 11:01.194
Who wants to know?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.963
I'll have the
gladiator's helping.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.001
What's with that smirk?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.202
What smirk?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.004
You know the one.

11:11.038 --> 11:11.972
Oh, yeah.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.343
[snaps whip] [horse lips]

11:16.376 --> 11:19.847
We have very
strange parents, DJ.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.981
Pull my finger.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.284
Pull your own finger.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.685
Hey, what's the
big idea of blowing

11:25.719 --> 11:29.256
a foul shot just because some
kid wants your phone number?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.457
You have such a big mouth.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.325
No, I don't.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.260
[shouting] Becky!

11:36.296 --> 11:39.967
You know, your grandfather
really missed you yesterday.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.568
Said he had a new joke for you.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.170
Yeah, let me guess--

11:43.203 --> 11:45.505
teacher says to Jimmy,
I see you have a cold.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.442
Jimmy says to the teacher,
can you see it now?

11:49.476 --> 11:52.345
Pull my finger.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.713
That'd be the one.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.821
Hey, what is the
big playing my records

12:00.854 --> 12:03.156
and leaving them like this?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.057
I'm talking to you.

12:04.091 --> 12:04.958
I know.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.059
I apologize.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.060
Can I be excused?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.329
No, we're not even
done eating yet.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.663
Where the hell is your sister?

12:10.697 --> 12:12.565
You want me to get her?

12:12.599 --> 12:16.503
Yeah, that'd be swell.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.238
Boy, she's being
awfully obedient.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.072
I noticed.

12:24.077 --> 12:24.878
Don't jump.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.452
You OK?

12:32.485 --> 12:38.291
I think I'm going to die.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.326
We're having breakfast.

12:43.496 --> 12:47.434
Don't even mention food.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.702
What'd you guys drink
yesterday, anyway?

12:49.736 --> 12:50.737
Who knows?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.573
Listen, I don't want
to talk about it.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.876
Well, Mom wants you
down for breakfast.

13:01.314 --> 13:05.185
If I even look at
food, I'm going to barf.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.253
Well, what should I tell Mom?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.220
Just tell her I'm sleeping.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.255
Tell her I don't feel well.

13:11.258 --> 13:15.896
So you becoming a drunk?

13:15.929 --> 13:18.365
Darlene, go downstairs.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.068
You mean, for some buttery
buckwheat pancakes and sausage?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.973
Darlene, shut up.

13:26.006 --> 13:26.806
I'm serious.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.912
You were so weird yesterday.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.981
You really scared me.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.815
I was just goofing with you.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.650
Look, I don't want a
sister who's a boozer.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.751
It's bad enough
I'm going to have

13:38.785 --> 13:40.187
to overcome your nerd legacy.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.257
Darlene, you're
in seventh grade.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.792
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.596
Now just go downstairs
and quit bugging me.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.364
Well, you're not going
to do this again, are you?

13:51.398 --> 13:54.201
Look, I'll do-- oh.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.269
I'll do whatever I feel
like doing, you little brat.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.804
Now beat it.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.340
OK, OK.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.777
Maybe when I come back up, I'll
bring you a little breakfast--

14:04.811 --> 14:07.114
maybe a sausage or two,
so you can bite down

14:07.147 --> 14:13.853
on one of those little hard
chunks and maybe a poached egg,

14:13.887 --> 14:18.391
slightly undercooked with
that white, runny stuff

14:18.425 --> 14:20.027
that you can never
quite keep on the spoon.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.895
[slurp] Yes.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.003
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.638
- Your mom home?
- Yeah.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.539
Hi.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.742
I'm Karen Hudson, Dana's mom.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.044
Oh, yeah, Roseanne Connor.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.345
Come on in.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.915
You'll have to excuse the
mess, but we live here.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.850
I'll only take a couple
of minutes of your time.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.052
Sure.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.254
You know, it's hard
enough trying to keep an eye

14:47.287 --> 14:49.957
on my kid being by myself here.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.524
I kind of have to
count on other parents

14:51.558 --> 14:54.261
to help out once in a while.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.262
Do you know what I mean?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.364
Well, no, not really.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.933
I think it's really crappy
that I let my kid come over

14:59.967 --> 15:01.468
here, and you guys
just leave them

15:01.501 --> 15:02.869
alone in the house
the whole damn day

15:02.902 --> 15:06.106
with an open liquor cabinet.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.540
What are you talking about?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.943
My kid came home
completely bombed yesterday,

15:09.977 --> 15:11.979
and she was throwing
up half the night.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.048
Are you saying that my
kid got your kid drunk?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.449
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.354
Becky.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.355
Go find your dad.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.256
Where is he?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.791
I don't-- just go find him.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.660
Becky, would you please
get your butt down here?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.899
Well, I'm sorry that
your kid came home drunk.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.667
But I mean, if you
know Becky at all,

15:34.701 --> 15:40.873
you know she just doesn't
do stuff like that.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.244
Did you and Dana get
crocked yesterday?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.145
Crocked?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.946
You mean, on liquor?

15:46.980 --> 15:50.317
Dana says you were
making tornadoes.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.584
We were working
on social studies.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.825
Well, maybe you
and Dana shouldn't

15:58.858 --> 16:00.160
work together anymore.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.529
I mean, she's been
throwing up all night,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.731
and you look like you've
been reincarnated as a rag.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.371
What's going on?

16:11.404 --> 16:14.107
Well, I guess we missed
some big party right here

16:14.141 --> 16:16.309
in our living room yesterday.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.977
What the hell went on here?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.912
Did you get in the liquor when
you were playing the records?

16:23.516 --> 16:24.584
I was playing the records.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.952
Wait a minute.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.321
Darlene, I thought you said
you were playing the records.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.190
Well, yeah.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.126
I mean, I got them
out, but Becky

16:33.160 --> 16:35.628
was actually playing them.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.564
Who was the bartender?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.233
Wasn't it that girl who was
over here studying with you?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.614
Well, look, I'm
sorry that I wasn't

16:54.647 --> 16:56.683
here to keep an eye on
whatever the hell went

16:56.716 --> 16:58.251
on here yesterday.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.519
I'm sorry, too.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.289
I've got a 14-year-old girl
at home with a hangover.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.891
Well, maybe you should go
home and take care of her.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.526
Maybe you guys should
shell out a few bucks

17:06.559 --> 17:08.428
and get a lock on
that liquor cabinet.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.897
Thanks, but I think we know
how to run our own household.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.265
Yeah.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.501
Well, don't expect to be seeing
my kid around here anymore.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.543
Becky, get upstairs till
we call you back down.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.345
No, I want to talk.
You sit there.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.413
Becky, get upstairs.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.081
I think we should
talk about this first.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.216
There's nothing
I'm going to say

17:29.249 --> 17:30.483
to you that I can't say to her.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.285
And I'm not feeling
real shy right now.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.686
Becky, get back in
here and sit down.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.825
What the hell is
with you, Becky?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.394
What, do you look people in
the face and then lie to them?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.963
You really pushed it too
far this time, kiddo.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.032
The first time we leave you
alone in this house and this

17:46.065 --> 17:47.334
is what you do?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.068
I'm going to go upstairs
and flush the wok.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.845
All right, Becky,
what happened here?

17:58.878 --> 18:02.115
And try telling
the truth this time.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.250
Look, it was no big deal.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.384
We had a couple of tornadoes.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.352
Oh, it's no big deal.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.186
How come you lied?

18:09.989 --> 18:11.858
Who made them?

18:11.891 --> 18:14.194
I made them.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.496
I want to know right
now, is this a new thing

18:16.529 --> 18:17.397
or a regular thing?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.665
I've never done it before.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.699
Is that the truth?

18:19.732 --> 18:20.600
Yes.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.634
What is the problem?

18:21.668 --> 18:22.969
You guys drink all the time.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.637
First of all, we don't
drink all the time.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.174
Second of all, we're
not talking about us.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.608
Look, I have one
drink and you're

18:28.641 --> 18:29.742
acting like I'm an alcoholic.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.480
Oh, quick, I'll
call the 800 number.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.248
We are your 800 number, Becky.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.287
And if you've got a
problem, you better

18:40.320 --> 18:42.054
tell us about it right now.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.022
We were bored.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.191
We were looking for
something to do.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.325
You want something to do?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.226
Find me.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.462
I'll give you something to do.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.231
I guess I just
wasn't thinking.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.734
For god's sake, Becky,
you're 14 years old.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.503
Mom, everything I do--

18:56.536 --> 18:59.306
everything I feel-- it's
always, well, she's 14.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.073
I mean, when you guys do
stuff, people don't go,

19:01.107 --> 19:01.974
oh, well, she's 37.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.453
36 1/2.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.491
Whatever.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.926
You know, Becky,
you're going to find

19:19.959 --> 19:23.095
that when the grownups
drink, they mostly

19:23.129 --> 19:26.366
drink for the wrong reasons.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.367
So what are the right reasons?

19:32.104 --> 19:33.806
- Honey?
- You're grounded.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.287
Could everyone be just
a little bit quieter?

19:50.890 --> 19:54.627
You have no idea
how horrible I feel.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.163
Oh, yes, I do.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.466
You know, I'm not so
much bothered by the fact

19:59.499 --> 20:00.733
that you took a drink.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.271
I mean, you tried it, you
got sick, you got caught.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.272
You know what that's like.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.873
What really bugs
the hell out of me

20:06.906 --> 20:09.242
is that I just can't
trust you anymore.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.344
And I always thought I could.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.012
You blew it big time.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.481
So what are you
saying-- that I have to be

20:14.514 --> 20:15.915
chaperoned the rest of my life?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.550
Well, you tell me.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.587
Can I not leave you alone
in the house anymore?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.554
Well, I could watch her.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.696
So do I have to
throw out every bit

20:29.729 --> 20:31.431
of liquor 'cause
you can't get that

20:31.464 --> 20:34.401
kids do not do what adults do?

20:34.434 --> 20:37.203
No, of course not.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.305
I'm sorry, Mom.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.473
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.542
I'm sorry that I can't
trust you anymore.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.810
Yes, you can.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.413
Yeah, well, we'll find out,
I guess, because I'm going

20:46.446 --> 20:49.349
to be watching you like a hawk.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.719
And maybe someday, a long,
long time from now, things

20:52.752 --> 20:55.988
will get back to the way they
were before, because that's

20:56.022 --> 20:58.224
the way they should be.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.927
Your father, on the other
hand, has decided to put

21:00.960 --> 21:04.797
a lock on the liquor cabinet--

21:04.831 --> 21:07.734
a fine tradition handed down
in his family for generations.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.469
[drill powers on]

21:19.145 --> 21:21.814
[music playing]
