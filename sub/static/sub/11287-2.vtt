SYNCLAIRE, SHE'S HERE!

00:05.366 --> 00:07.166
OKAY, OKAY.

00:08.733 --> 00:10.666
Both:
WELCOME HOME!

00:10.733 --> 00:12.666
OH, YOU TWO...

00:12.733 --> 00:17.766
NOW YOU KNOW HOW I HATE
BEING MADE A FUSS OVER.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.833
OKAY, NOW GET ONE
FROM THIS ANGLE HERE.

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
COME ON.

00:21.966 --> 00:23.366
IN FIVE, FOUR

00:23.433 --> 00:25.333
THREE, TWO...

00:25.400 --> 00:28.700
OH, YOU TWO!

00:28.766 --> 00:33.066
NOW YOU KNOW HOW I HATE
BEING MADE A FUSS OVER.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.433
GREAT. THAT ALMOST FELT REAL.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.133
IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK
IN THE PLACE LIKE YOU KNOW

00:40.200 --> 00:42.166
LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.400
THE OLD STOMPING...

00:44.466 --> 00:46.433
WHERE'S MY COUCH?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.433
I GOT RID OF THAT
RAGGEDY THING.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.700
I GOT THIS ONE

00:49.766 --> 00:52.466
AT THAT NEW SCANDINAVIAN
FURNITURE WAREHOUSE.

00:52.533 --> 00:54.066
BJORN FREE.

00:54.133 --> 00:56.600
WELL, I...
I GUESS IT'S NICE

00:56.666 --> 00:58.733
TO HAVE A SPLASH OF FRESHNESS

00:58.800 --> 01:00.100
IN A BELOVED OLD...

01:00.166 --> 01:01.373
WHERE IS MY RUG?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.473
OH, IT DIDN'T GO
WITH THE NEW COUCH.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.206
IT'S AT THE SALVATION ARMY.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.706
MY BEDROOM DRAPES?

01:11.773 --> 01:13.006
I ONLY USED

01:13.073 --> 01:15.640
A SMALL PIECE AS A RAG.

01:15.706 --> 01:18.240
THE REST OF IT
MADE A WELCOME BED

01:18.306 --> 01:22.206
FOR THAT PREGNANT ALLEY CAT
DURING HER TIME OF JOY.

01:22.273 --> 01:24.540
YOU... YOU PEOPLE

01:24.606 --> 01:28.273
HAVE ERASED EVERY TRACE
OF MY EVER BEING HERE.

01:28.340 --> 01:31.073
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT ME BACK?

01:31.140 --> 01:32.606
REGINE...

01:32.673 --> 01:34.440
COME ON NOW‐‐ YOU'RE FAM.

01:34.506 --> 01:38.340
NOW SOME TACKY DRAPES
AND A BOOTY‐ASS RUG
CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

01:38.406 --> 01:40.340
REGINE, WE
LOVE YOU HOME.

01:40.406 --> 01:41.673
ALL RIGHT.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.040
OBIE, WOULD YOU

01:43.106 --> 01:45.740
BE A DEAR
AND TAKE THAT UP TO MY ROOM?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.106
WHICH IS NOW UPSTAIRS
AND TO YOUR RIGHT.

01:48.173 --> 01:49.673
I TOOK YOUR OLD ROOM.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.940
YOU TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL,
CROSS‐VENTILATED ROOM

01:53.006 --> 01:56.040
AND PUT ME IN THAT MEAT LOCKER
OF YOURS?

01:56.106 --> 01:57.173
YOU WON'T BE COLD.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.973
WHY? Y'ALL GOT
THE RADIATOR FIXED?

01:59.040 --> 02:01.146
NO. I'VE TAKEN KHADIJAH'S ROOM.

02:01.213 --> 02:03.580
YOU'VE GOT MY OLD ROOM‐‐

MAN, I'VE BEEN DRIVING NAILS

02:54.080 --> 02:56.080
SINCE I WAS KNEE‐HIGH
TO A TOOL BOX

02:56.146 --> 02:58.180

A KNUCKLE.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.146
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU,
OBIE.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.553
GEEZ, NOT YOU.

03:01.620 --> 03:03.086

OVERTON,
LET'S JUST GET

03:20.786 --> 03:22.820
YOUR DRYWALL
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

03:22.886 --> 03:24.953
THIS PLACE REEKS
OF MANUAL LABOR.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.986
HEY, PUG,
REMEMBER
THAT TIME

03:27.053 --> 03:28.286
WHEN KYLE TRIED
TO ASSEMBLE

03:28.353 --> 03:29.520
THE C. D. RACK?

03:29.586 --> 03:31.286
HE WAS ACTUALLY
TRYING TO PUT

03:31.353 --> 03:33.053
A SQUARE PEG
IN A ROUND HOLE.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.086
YOU THINK IT'S JUST
A SAYING

03:35.153 --> 03:36.553
BUT THIS FOOL

03:36.620 --> 03:38.086
COULDN'T EVEN DO IT...

03:38.153 --> 03:42.353
KYLE, IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO TELL THE STORY...

03:42.420 --> 03:44.186
JUST SAY SO.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.153
OH, LORD, IT'S MELODY.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.920
HOW CAN SHE MOVE HERE?

03:51.986 --> 03:53.820
I HAD DIBS ON NEW YORK.

03:53.886 --> 03:55.386
MAYBE SHE'S JUST VISITING.

03:55.453 --> 03:57.386
MAN, SHE'S
BUYING DOORKNOBS.

03:57.453 --> 03:59.886

WITH THE KNOBS?

04:03.460 --> 04:04.560
MY EX.

04:04.626 --> 04:06.626
SHE'S THE REASON

04:06.693 --> 04:07.660
I HAD TO LEAVE
FAIR CLEVELAND.

04:07.726 --> 04:09.060
SHE COMING THIS WAY?

04:09.126 --> 04:11.060
I'LL ACQUIRE THE TARGET.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.060
HOLD, HOLD.

04:13.126 --> 04:14.726
"ACQUIRE THE TARGET"?

04:14.793 --> 04:17.526
YEAH, ARMY RESERVE,
ONE WEEKEND A MONTH.

04:17.593 --> 04:18.993
I BE ALL I CAN BE.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.226

04:21.293 --> 04:24.660
SHE'S IN "SOILS OF THE WORLD"
AND CLOSING RAPIDLY.

LET'S ROLL OUT OF HERE.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.693

WHAT IS THIS THING?

04:47.660 --> 04:50.726
AND WHAT IS IT DOING
IN OUR BATHROOM?

04:50.793 --> 04:53.960
MY AUNT MO SENT ME THAT.

04:54.026 --> 04:55.393

05:01.833 --> 05:02.966
HEY

05:03.033 --> 05:05.300
DID YOU AGREE TO THIS
JUST TO TORTURE ME?

05:05.366 --> 05:07.333
OF COURSE NOT.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.766

YOU KNOW, OVERTON,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING

BY AVOIDING MELODY.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.933
DISCRETION IS THE
BETTER PART OF VALOR.

JUST A FANCY WAY OF SAYING
I'M A COWARD.

05:51.666 --> 05:56.200
NO, NOT SO MUCH FANCY...
AS IT IS ELOQUENT.

05:56.266 --> 05:58.700
YOU KNOW, I RAN FROM THAT GIRL
THREE YEARS AGO

05:58.766 --> 06:00.406
AND I RAN FROM HER TODAY.

06:00.473 --> 06:03.806
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
GO SEE HER.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.840
ARE YOU FORGETTING
THE LIPS?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.240
ONE KISS FROM HER

06:08.306 --> 06:11.006
AND YOU WERE PAINTING
HER TOE NAILS.

06:11.073 --> 06:14.073
RIGHT.
CAN'T RISK THE LIPS.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.540
BUT I MUST...

06:15.606 --> 06:17.773
I MUSTN'T...

06:17.840 --> 06:19.440
I SHALL

06:19.506 --> 06:20.940
I SHAN'T.

06:22.273 --> 06:23.906
SHAN'T I?

06:25.873 --> 06:27.273
EXCUSE ME, HAMLET.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.473
BUT WHAT ABOUT

06:28.540 --> 06:29.606
WHEN SYNCLAIRE FINDS OUT?

06:29.673 --> 06:31.673
YOU MEAN BEFORE I TELL HER?

06:31.740 --> 06:33.073
NO, BROTHER.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.373
GIRLFRIENDS ARE BEST HANDLED
ON A NEED‐TO‐KNOW BASIS.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.873
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG,
MY CANINE FRIEND.

06:41.340 --> 06:46.073
SEE, IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP, WOMEN...

06:46.140 --> 06:48.340
( softer: )
WOMEN ARE PSYCHIC.

06:48.406 --> 06:50.173
YOU DON'T TELL THEM
SOMETHING'S UP

06:50.240 --> 06:51.406
THEY'LL SENSE IT.

06:51.473 --> 06:53.040
BRING IT UP
WHILE YOU'RE EATING

06:53.106 --> 06:54.873
AND A BROTHER COULD
CHOKE TO DEATH.

06:54.940 --> 06:58.106
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

06:58.173 --> 07:00.106
W‐W‐WOULD THIS
APPLY TO MAX

07:00.173 --> 07:02.513
NOW THAT SHE AND I
ARE A COUPLE?

07:02.580 --> 07:04.780
SHE CAN READ YOUR MIND.

07:04.846 --> 07:07.446
SHE'S YOUR EYE IN THE SKY.

07:07.513 --> 07:09.913
COULD BE IT BE POSSIBLE
THAT SHE ALREADY KNOWS

07:09.980 --> 07:12.880
I'M PLANNING ON GOING
TO THE GIANTS GAME WITHOUT HER?

07:12.946 --> 07:14.013
OH, GOOD GOD!

07:14.080 --> 07:16.280
I SHOULDN'T PUT THAT
OUT THERE.

07:16.346 --> 07:19.013
CAN WE GET BACK TO MY PROBLEM?

07:19.080 --> 07:20.446
I MUST DEFEND MYSELF

07:20.513 --> 07:22.613
AGAINST THAT PIT BULL

07:22.680 --> 07:24.746

07:24.813 --> 07:26.480
OF INCRIMINATING THOUGHTS.

07:28.146 --> 07:29.346

07:48.946 --> 07:50.213

07:50.280 --> 07:53.646
JUST AN EX‐GIRLFRIEND
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

07:53.713 --> 07:55.313
MELODY?

07:55.380 --> 07:56.646
THE GIRL

07:56.713 --> 07:58.046
WHO BROKE YOUR HEART

07:58.113 --> 08:00.080
AND DROVE YOU OUT
OF FAIR CLEVELAND?

08:00.146 --> 08:03.853
DAMN, YOU'RE ON TODAY,
AIN'T YOU, GIRL?

08:06.020 --> 08:07.786
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

08:07.853 --> 08:10.886
KYLE SPOTTED HER DOWN
AT THE HARDWARE HACIENDA.

08:10.953 --> 08:13.486
APPARENTLY, SHE'S
MOVED HERE TO BROOKLYN

08:13.553 --> 08:15.486
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE HER
ONE MORE TIME

08:15.553 --> 08:17.086
IF THAT'S COOL WITH YOU.

08:18.386 --> 08:19.853
WHAT A RELIEF.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.286
I FORBID YOU.

08:21.353 --> 08:23.953
THERE, THAT'S
SETTLED, ISN'T IT?

08:28.986 --> 08:32.486
OH, COME ON,
MY LITTLE DUNKAROO.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.053
THIS IS ONE CHAPTER
OF MY LIFE

08:35.120 --> 08:37.553
I REALLY NEED
TO PUT BEHIND ME.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.653
WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.320
I DON'T KNOW.

08:41.385 --> 08:43.020
ABOUT FIVE‐TWO

08:43.086 --> 08:44.653
MEDIUM BUILT

08:44.720 --> 08:46.486
REGULAR HAIR

08:46.553 --> 08:48.486
LITTLE SMALL ANKLES...

08:48.553 --> 08:50.153
UH‐UH! FORGET IT!

08:50.220 --> 08:51.353
FORGET IT!

08:51.420 --> 08:53.553
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
PERMISSION

08:53.620 --> 08:56.820
TO SEE SOME THIN‐ANKLED BABE
WITH TA‐TAS TO TUESDAY? NO!

08:56.886 --> 08:59.586
"TA‐TAS TO TUESDAY"?

08:59.653 --> 09:02.326
I KNOW YOUR TASTE.

09:02.393 --> 09:05.226
YOU KNOW, SYNCLAIRE,
I COULD HAVE GONE TO SEE HER

09:05.293 --> 09:07.593
AND YOU NEVER
WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT.

09:14.826 --> 09:16.860
OKAY, YOU'D KNOW INSTANTLY.

09:16.926 --> 09:18.826
BUT, I MEAN,
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

09:18.893 --> 09:20.226
( beeping )

09:20.293 --> 09:22.693
OF COURSE I
TRUST YOU, OVERTON.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.926
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

09:24.993 --> 09:26.926
MY HEART
IS TELLING ME "NO"

09:26.993 --> 09:30.193
AND MY HEAD IS
TELLING ME "HELL, NO."

09:30.260 --> 09:32.193
( beeping )

09:32.260 --> 09:33.726
OH, SHOOT.

09:33.793 --> 09:36.093
THAT'S A PRIORITY ONE.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.426
IT MUST BE
THAT NEW TENANT IN 2‐F.

09:38.493 --> 09:41.593
PROBABLY GOT HIS ARM STUCK
IN THE TRASH SHOOT AGAIN.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.326
KEEP TRYING TO TELL HIM

09:43.393 --> 09:46.526
"YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT NO GARBAGE, MAN."

09:49.460 --> 09:51.726
YEAH, HELLO. THIS IS OVERTON...

09:51.793 --> 09:53.093
OH.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.293
HELLO, THERE.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.126
MELODY.

09:56.193 --> 09:59.026
UH, LONG TIME NO HEAR.

09:59.093 --> 10:02.000
UH, HOW'D YOU GET THE NUMBER?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.166
OH, YEAH, PUG.

10:06.233 --> 10:07.533
GOOD OL' PUG.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.833
PUG DID IT.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.300
YEAH, THAT WAS ME WADDLING.

10:13.366 --> 10:16.800
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.533
HOLD ON A SECOND.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.066
UH... LOVE?

10:23.066 --> 10:25.400
UH, SHE WANTS TO GET TOGETHER.

10:25.466 --> 10:27.766
OVERTON?

10:27.833 --> 10:30.700
WELL, IT'LL BE A WELL‐LIT
NEUTRAL TERRITORY.

10:30.766 --> 10:32.133
I WON'T SHAVE.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.700
I WON'T USE BODY SPLASH.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.266
I WON'T EVEN MOISTURIZE.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.800
FINE, OVERTON, GO.

10:37.866 --> 10:39.066
ALL RIGHT.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.366
LOOK HERE, MELODY,
THERE'S A CHEEZY BURGER

10:41.433 --> 10:43.600
ON THE CORNER OF FLATBUSH
AND ST. JAMES.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.666
I'LL SEE YOU IN ABOUT,
OH, HALF HOUR?

10:45.733 --> 10:47.666
OKAY. SEE YOU.

10:47.733 --> 10:49.900
( sighs )

10:49.966 --> 10:53.866
THANKS FOR BEING
UNDERSTANDING, BABY.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.133
OH, YEAH, THAT'S ME.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.200
GOOD OL'
UNDERSTANDING SYNCLAIRE.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.866
I'LL JUST SIT HERE...

10:59.933 --> 11:04.540
WHILE A PIECE OF MY SOUL
FESTERS AND DIES.

11:04.606 --> 11:05.873
WELL...

11:05.940 --> 11:07.773
AGAIN, THANKS.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.140
UM...

11:11.206 --> 11:12.840
CAN I BRING YOU ANYTHING BACK?

11:14.540 --> 11:16.740
JUST GO.

11:18.806 --> 11:20.806
FRIES!

11:32.540 --> 11:33.673
OVERTON.

11:33.740 --> 11:34.873
MELODY.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.506
YEAH, UH, KISS‐KISS.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.506
WHAT MADE YOU PICK
A PLACE LIKE THIS?

11:40.573 --> 11:42.306
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
SAYS "FAST."

11:42.373 --> 11:46.140
GET IN, GET WHAT YOU NEED,
AND GET OUT. SHALL WE?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.940
I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY

11:48.006 --> 11:51.240
OF ORDERING YOU A BONUS
MEAL TO SAVE TIME.

11:51.306 --> 11:53.973
OBIE, IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.640
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT
THERE'S NOTHING SYMBOLIC

11:56.706 --> 11:58.773
ABOUT THE <i>BRIDGES</i>
<i>OF MADISON COUNTY</i>

11:58.840 --> 11:59.946
COLLECTOR'S CUPS.

12:00.013 --> 12:01.480
THEY COME WITH THE MEAL.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.713
NOW WHICH ONE YOU WANT?

12:03.780 --> 12:07.146
CLINT AND MERYL COOKING
OR CLINT AND MERYL KISSING?

12:07.213 --> 12:09.480
I'LL TAKE KISSING.

12:12.980 --> 12:14.246
I CAN'T BELIEVE

12:14.313 --> 12:17.246
OVERTON'S WITH THAT
THIN‐ANKLED HEIFER RIGHT NOW.

12:17.313 --> 12:21.480
I SAY WE ROLL DOWN TO CHEEZY
BURGER AND KICK HER ASS.

12:22.946 --> 12:24.946
MAX.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.080
OR WE COULD JUST STICK
WITH PLAN "A"

12:31.146 --> 12:35.680
AND JUST SIT HERE THINKING
NASTY THOUGHTS ABOUT HER.

12:35.746 --> 12:36.880
HONEY, LOOK.

12:36.946 --> 12:39.280
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME

12:39.346 --> 12:41.880
JUST CALL ONE OF
YOUR OLD PARAMOURS

12:41.946 --> 12:44.846
AND SIMPLY FAN
THE FLAME A LITTLE.

12:44.913 --> 12:47.213
IF YOU'RE NOT MAD ENOUGH
TO KICK BUTT

12:47.280 --> 12:50.246
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET HIM
HAVE THIS LITTLE FLING.

12:50.313 --> 12:52.346
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

12:52.413 --> 12:53.746
IF KYLE DID THAT?

12:53.813 --> 12:55.746
OH, YEAH, I'M WITH KYLE NOW.

12:55.813 --> 13:00.820
DANG, I GOT TO REMEMBER THAT.

13:00.886 --> 13:05.353
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO OVERTON.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.353
SYNCLAIRE, IT'S
BASIC MALE PSYCHOLOGY.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.586
WHEN A MAN SEES
AN EX‐GIRLFRIEND

13:09.653 --> 13:12.020
HE CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S STILL BREATHING

13:12.086 --> 13:14.786
AND FORMING
COMPLETE SENTENCES.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.853
HOW DOES SHE DO IT?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.353
HE MUST KNOW.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.020
( knocking )

13:20.853 --> 13:22.686
HELLO, KYLE!

13:22.753 --> 13:24.086
MY MAN!

13:27.420 --> 13:28.686
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:28.753 --> 13:31.686
I'M WITH YOU NOW.

13:31.753 --> 13:34.653
DANG, I'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER THAT.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.853
SYNCLAIRE, OVERTON TELLS ME
YOU'RE A LITTLE UPSET.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.586
I ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.253
REALLY? YOU DON'T THINK

13:41.320 --> 13:42.720
HE'S INTERESTED
IN HER STILL?

13:42.786 --> 13:44.453
OH, PLEASE, AFTER THE WAY

13:44.520 --> 13:46.653
SHE TURNED DOWN
HIS MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.253
WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:49.320 --> 13:52.953
( women clamoring )

13:53.020 --> 13:56.953
UH...
OBIE DIDN'T MENTION THAT, HUH?

13:57.020 --> 13:58.886
OOH, MY BAD.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.826
OKAY.

14:01.893 --> 14:05.026
OKAY, SO OVERTON WANTS
TO MAKE HER MRS. JONES?

14:05.093 --> 14:07.626
THEY'VE GOT
A THING GOING ON?

14:07.693 --> 14:09.826
SYNCLAIRE, YOU
GOT IT ALL WRONG.

14:09.893 --> 14:11.826
TWO CAN PLAY THIS GAME.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.160
IT'S NOT LIKE MY PAST
DOESN'T HAVE ITS CHECKERS.

14:16.193 --> 14:17.326
WHERE YOU GOING?

14:17.393 --> 14:19.726
I MET A MAN
IN BAYONNE FIVE YEARS AGO

14:19.793 --> 14:22.160
WHO SENDS ME
A CHRISTMAS CARD EVERY YEAR.

14:22.226 --> 14:23.993
WELL, MY SECRET SANTA

14:24.060 --> 14:26.560
IS ABOUT TO GET A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA

14:26.626 --> 14:27.960
IN HIS CHRISTMAS STOCKING.

14:28.026 --> 14:29.660
PING! HERE I GO.

14:35.860 --> 14:39.426
A LOT'S CHANGED
IN THREE YEARS, OBIE.

14:39.493 --> 14:42.093
YEAH, CERTAINLY HAS.

14:42.160 --> 14:46.626
I BET YOU'RE STILL
TICKLISH UNDERNEATH YOUR KNEES.

14:46.693 --> 14:48.226
NO, I THINK I'M OVER THAT.

14:48.293 --> 14:49.560
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS

14:49.626 --> 14:52.326
I'VE WORN LONG KNEE SOCKS
WITHOUT GIGGLING.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.360
OH, YEAH?

14:53.426 --> 14:54.393
MM‐HMM. YEAH.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.560
REALLY?

14:55.626 --> 14:56.893
OH, WATCH OUT NOW.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.566
UH. OKAY. UM...

15:00.633 --> 15:01.900
LOOKY HERE, MELODY.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.566
THIS HAS ALL BEEN
ROARING GOOD FUN

15:04.633 --> 15:07.400
BUT WHY DID YOU
WANT TO SEE ME?

15:07.466 --> 15:09.800
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT YOU

15:09.866 --> 15:12.000
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
OBIE

15:12.066 --> 15:15.400
AND WHEN I GOT
THIS JOB OFFER IN NEW YORK

15:15.466 --> 15:17.533
IT FELT LIKE FATE.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000
AND...

15:19.066 --> 15:21.300
I NOTICED YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A RING ON YOUR FINGER.

15:21.366 --> 15:22.566
OH, YEAH.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.966
YOU'RE A FINE ONE
TO BRING UP RINGS.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.300
I GUESS YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

15:26.366 --> 15:28.700
ABOUT THE STEALERS
VS. THE BROWNS

15:28.766 --> 15:30.933
OCTOBER 11, 1992.

15:31.000 --> 15:31.966
IT TOOK A LOT

15:32.033 --> 15:34.533
TO GET THAT UP
ON THE SCOREBOARD.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.400
"MELODY, WILL YOU
MARRY ME? OVERTON."

15:37.466 --> 15:39.300
I REMEMBER, OBIE‐‐
I WAS THERE.

15:39.366 --> 15:42.400
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE YOUR
FACE WHEN YOU TURNED ME DOWN

15:42.466 --> 15:44.000
ON THE
DIAMOND‐VISION SCREEN.

15:44.066 --> 15:45.600
AND THERE
WAS THE REFEREE

15:45.666 --> 15:49.333
WITH THE SMART ATTITUDE
SIGNALING "INCOMPLETE PASS."

15:51.000 --> 15:53.100
AND WHEN I RAN OUT OF THERE

15:53.166 --> 15:55.100
YOU DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW.

15:55.166 --> 15:58.266
OBIE, I TRIED, BUT
I LOST YOU IN THE WAVE.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.473
YOU COULD HAVE TRACKED ME DOWN.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.273
I HUNG AROUND CLEVELAND
FOR ALMOST FOUR HOURS

16:03.340 --> 16:05.906
BEFORE I MOVED TO NEW YORK.

16:06.940 --> 16:08.073
OBIE...

16:08.140 --> 16:10.073
I WAS THE LOSER
THAT DAY.

16:10.140 --> 16:11.406
I WAS SUCH A SNOB.

16:11.473 --> 16:14.406
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE TOO SIMPLE FOR ME

16:14.473 --> 16:16.606
BUT I HAVE GROWN
ENOUGH TO KNOW

16:16.673 --> 16:18.973
THAT I WANT A SIMPLE GUY‐‐

16:19.040 --> 16:20.840
A SIMPLE

16:20.906 --> 16:23.473
AVERAGE, ORDINARY,
RUN‐OF‐THE‐MILL...

16:23.540 --> 16:26.573
YEAH, YEAH, SIMPLE‐‐
I GET IT.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.573
OBIE, I KNOW
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH

16:28.640 --> 16:30.573
TO THINK THAT WE
COULD JUST...

16:30.640 --> 16:32.573
PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF

16:32.640 --> 16:36.506
BUT, WELL, I WAS HOPING
THAT MAYBE WE COULD...

16:36.573 --> 16:38.040
START OVER?

16:43.506 --> 16:44.973
SYNCLAIRE JAMES?

16:45.040 --> 16:46.373
YOU MUST REMEMBER.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.873
WE MET IN ATLANTIC CITY
AT THE DOM DeLUISE TAFFY PULL.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.473
SORRY. STILL BLANK.

16:53.540 --> 16:56.473
YOU SEND ME A CHRISTMAS CARD
EVERY YEAR.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.673
OH, YOU AND 1,200 OTHER PEOPLE.

16:58.740 --> 17:00.146
I SELL INSURANCE.

17:00.213 --> 17:02.246
ON THIS YEAR'S CARD

17:02.313 --> 17:03.713
LIFT THE MANGER.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.546
YOU'LL FIND
A HANDY CALENDAR.

17:06.579 --> 17:07.646
COME ON.

17:07.713 --> 17:10.180
WE WENT TO THE STEVE
AND EYDIE CONCERT.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.280
WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT GOING.

17:12.346 --> 17:14.780
WELL, ACTUALLY, I TALKED
ABOUT GOING, BUT...

17:14.846 --> 17:16.780
IT WAS A NIGHT
OF UNBRIDLED PASSION.

17:16.846 --> 17:18.079
Woman:
DARREN!

17:18.146 --> 17:19.280
WHO'S AT THE DOOR?

17:19.346 --> 17:22.913
SOME WOMAN WHO DIDN'T
BUY A POLICY, DEAR!

17:22.980 --> 17:24.713
BUT WHO MIGHT
BE INTERESTED

17:24.780 --> 17:27.913
IN A HIGH‐QUALITY
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH
PLAN WHICH COVERS

17:27.980 --> 17:30.980
MOST PRE‐EXISTING
MENTAL CONDITIONS?

17:32.946 --> 17:34.446
MELODY, UM...

17:34.513 --> 17:36.946
SEEING YOU LIKE THIS

17:37.013 --> 17:38.446
RACKED BY REMORSE...

17:38.513 --> 17:40.513
IT DOES MY HEART GOOD.

17:42.446 --> 17:43.980
THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR US.

17:44.046 --> 17:47.346
I MEAN, I'M IN LOVE
WITH A WONDERFUL WOMAN.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.713
OVERTON

17:48.780 --> 17:51.113
WE WERE IN LOVE FOR SIX YEARS.

17:51.180 --> 17:53.113
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING LEFT.

17:53.180 --> 17:56.380
OTHERWISE
WHY DID YOU AGREE TO SEE ME?

17:56.446 --> 17:59.920
MAYBE I WASN'T SURE YOU WERE
REALLY OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

17:59.986 --> 18:01.453
WELL...

18:03.153 --> 18:04.820
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF MINE.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.086
NOTHING.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.653
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.986
NO SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

18:27.053 --> 18:29.386
MY LEFT ARM'S NOT NUMB

18:29.453 --> 18:33.353
AND I DON'T HEAR MARVIN GAYE.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.720
THANK YOU, MELODY.

18:35.786 --> 18:38.053
NOW I KNOW WHY I CAME

18:38.120 --> 18:40.286
AND WHY I HAVE TO GO.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.586
OBIE, ARE YOU SURE?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.586
WELL,
CAN WE AT LEAST BE FRIENDS?

18:46.653 --> 18:49.320
I BELIEVE IT WAS LORD BYRON
WHO SAID

18:49.386 --> 18:52.520
"THE BEST WAY WILL BE TO AVOID
EACH OTHER

18:52.586 --> 18:54.320
WITHOUT APPEARING TO DO SO."

18:54.386 --> 18:57.486
LETTER OF APRIL 25, 1814.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.886
GOOD‐BYE, GIRLIE.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.860
MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR ALL OF THIS TO GO DOWN.

19:07.926 --> 19:10.660
OBIE SEEING THE WOMAN
WHO REJECTED HIM.

19:10.726 --> 19:12.460
SYNCLAIRE
REKINDLING AN OLD FLAME.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.393
THIS IS TRULY A HOMECOMING.

19:17.493 --> 19:19.193
HEY, HOW'D IT GO IN BAYONNE?

19:19.260 --> 19:21.326
OKAY, I GUESS.

19:21.393 --> 19:25.726
I'M COVERED UP TO THREE MONTHS
IN A SANITARIUM.

19:26.893 --> 19:28.826
I HEARD YOU COME IN,
SWEET THING.

19:28.893 --> 19:30.360
LOOK WHAT I GOT.

19:30.426 --> 19:32.560
YOUR FAVORITE‐‐
THAT BUBBLE GUM

19:32.626 --> 19:35.460
THAT LOOKS
LIKE CHEWING TOBACCO.

19:35.526 --> 19:38.060
WELL, I ASKED FOR FRIES,
BUT THANKS.

19:39.593 --> 19:40.993
UH, SYNCLAIRE...

19:41.060 --> 19:42.393
OVERTON.

19:47.726 --> 19:50.460
I JUST WENT TO SEE
A FRIEND IN NEW JERSEY.

19:50.526 --> 19:54.060
ON THE WAY BACK,
MAX'S CAR RAN OUT OF GAS

19:54.126 --> 19:58.326
AND DURING THE WALK HOME,
I HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK.

19:58.393 --> 19:59.666
BY THE WAY, MAX

19:59.733 --> 20:01.666
YOU MAY WANT TO CALL
TRIPLE‐"A."

20:01.733 --> 20:05.000
YOUR CAR'S SORT OF BLOCKING
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.466
I REMEMBER THE TIME

20:10.533 --> 20:12.933
THAT GUY
FROM NIGHT SCHOOL KISSED ME.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.166
YOU WERE MAD AT FIRST,
BUT EVENTUALLY YOU UNDERSTOOD.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.800
YEAH, WELL, THAT
SORT OF THING

20:18.866 --> 20:22.200
CAN HAPPEN TO THE MOST
INNOCENT OF VICTIMS.

20:23.966 --> 20:27.500
LISTEN, THE WAY I SEE IT,
EVERY PERSON IN A RELATIONSHIP

20:27.566 --> 20:29.100
IS ENTITLED TO ONE "GIMME."

20:29.166 --> 20:32.366
THAT WAS MY "GIMME,"
AND THIS WAS YOURS.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.933
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
GRATEFUL TO MELODY.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.933
IF SHE HADN'T
HAVE DUMPED ME

20:38.000 --> 20:40.333
I NEVER WOULD HAVE MET YOU.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.866
NOW, OVERTON?

20:53.933 --> 20:58.066
ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE TOLD ME
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR PAST?

20:58.133 --> 21:00.473
LIKE WHY YOU NEVER
TOLD SYNCLAIRE

21:00.540 --> 21:03.140
YOU ASKED THAT WOMAN
TO MARRY YOU.

21:04.506 --> 21:07.040
LOOK HERE, LITTLE WOMAN,
I MOVED YOU IN.

21:07.106 --> 21:10.473
I CAN MOVE YOUR HAPPY ASS
UP OUT OF HERE.

21:17.873 --> 21:20.740
SYNCLAIRE, I'LL BE HAPPY

21:20.806 --> 21:23.540
TO DISCUSS THIS WITH
YOU IN DETAIL LATER

21:23.606 --> 21:24.873
BUT RIGHT NOW

21:24.940 --> 21:27.940
I GOT TO HAVE A QUICK CHAT
WITH MY FRIEND KYLE.

21:29.606 --> 21:30.873
OH, SHORTY!

21:30.940 --> 21:32.906
GOT A MINUTE?

21:39.373 --> 21:40.873
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

21:40.940 --> 21:43.873
THINK I'LL GO UP
TO MY LOVELY NEW ROOM.

21:44.973 --> 21:47.140
THAT'S A LOVELY
NEW ATTITUDE.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.740
IT JUST TOOK ME
SOME TIME TO ADJUST

21:49.806 --> 21:52.140
AND BESIDES,
WHEN I WAS TEARING DOWN

21:52.206 --> 21:54.806
SYNCLAIRE'S ZODIAC WALLPAPER...

21:56.340 --> 21:58.106
I FOUND A LIVE CABLE OUTLET

21:58.173 --> 22:01.113
THAT GIVES ME EVERY
PREMIUM CHANNEL FOR FREE.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.146
SO IF ANYONE
WANTS TO SEE

22:03.213 --> 22:04.913
THE TYSON FIGHT

22:04.980 --> 22:07.246
IT'S STARTING
IN JUST FOUR MINUTES

22:07.313 --> 22:10.246
AND IT'S ONLY 15 BUCKS.

22:10.313 --> 22:12.913
( laughing )

22:12.980 --> 22:16.980
