WEBVTT

00:01.826 --> 00:02.743
NARRATOR:
The Dome of the Rock.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.245
The Temple of Jupiter.

00:05.329 --> 00:06.755
Puma Punku.

00:08.082 --> 00:10.917
They are sites sacred
to millions of people,

00:11.011 --> 00:13.929
and they are all built
atop the ruins of structures

00:14.088 --> 00:16.089
that are far more ancient.

00:16.174 --> 00:19.852
WILLIAM HENRY: Some of the most
iconic temples sites around the world

00:19.936 --> 00:23.605
are built on the exact
same location as former temples.

00:23.765 --> 00:25.024
And the question is, why?

00:26.601 --> 00:29.686
NARRATOR: What compelled
early humans to build and rebuild

00:29.779 --> 00:33.607
in the same place,
again and again?

00:33.691 --> 00:37.194
It seems they were not only
doing it for practical purposes

00:37.278 --> 00:39.696
but also for religious
and spiritual reasons.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.957
NARRATOR:
Are there locations on Earth

00:42.042 --> 00:44.117
that hold special power?

00:44.202 --> 00:45.878
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
The local population say,

00:46.037 --> 00:50.299
"It was not us who built this.
It was the gods."

00:50.458 --> 00:54.294
NARRATOR: And might we
find that they were once occupied

00:54.387 --> 00:56.472
by extraterrestrials?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.891
GEORGE NOORY:
There is no question in my mind

00:59.050 --> 01:02.135
that these are much older sites
than we think,

01:02.228 --> 01:05.138
and that they were spots for
extraterrestrial communication

01:05.231 --> 01:07.149
a long, long time ago.

01:09.644 --> 01:11.812
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:11.905 --> 01:14.731
in the universe.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.576
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.330
It demands
we question everything

01:21.489 --> 01:23.665
we have ever been taught.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.003
The evidence is all around us.

01:28.162 --> 01:31.414
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:31.499 --> 01:34.167
We are not alone.

01:34.252 --> 01:37.596
We have never been alone.

01:47.765 --> 01:50.517
Cuzco, Peru.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.937
Nestled in a high river valley
of the Andes Mountains,

01:54.030 --> 01:57.449
among peaks towering
over 20,000 feet,

01:57.608 --> 02:01.194
this once great city served
as the capital

02:01.287 --> 02:02.946
of the Inca Empire

02:03.030 --> 02:06.449
from the 13th
to 16th centuries AD.

02:06.543 --> 02:11.630
In 1533, Spanish conquistadors
arrived in Cuzco

02:11.789 --> 02:15.208
and were astonished
by the incredible stonework

02:15.301 --> 02:19.805
found at a site just north
of the city called Sacsayhuamán.

02:21.716 --> 02:24.885
Above the city of Cuzco
we find the megalithic site

02:24.969 --> 02:28.438
and huge ceremonial Inca complex
called Sacsayhuamán.

02:30.057 --> 02:34.236
Its most prominent feature is
a zigzag wall of three levels.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.065
Some of the stones there weigh
as much as 125 tons

02:39.150 --> 02:43.403
and were moved from the quarry
at least three miles away.

02:43.487 --> 02:47.249
Sacsayhuamán is one of the most
beautiful ancient structures

02:47.408 --> 02:49.159
you will ever see in your life.

02:49.252 --> 02:53.672
There are massive,
gigantic megalithic blocks,

02:53.756 --> 02:58.177
and you find the most amazing
of masonry style

02:58.261 --> 03:00.846
where you can't even fit
a dollar bill

03:00.930 --> 03:05.175
in between the fittings
of any of the blocks.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.762
NARRATOR: Sacsayhuamán
served both as a fortress

03:08.855 --> 03:11.097
and a ceremonial center.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.352
A circular structure that lies
within the megalithic walls,

03:15.436 --> 03:18.530
called Muyuq Marka,
was the base of a tower

03:18.689 --> 03:22.367
where the Inca worshipped
the sun god Inti.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.946
However, many experts suggest
that while the Inca

03:26.030 --> 03:28.698
certainly utilized
this megalithic structure,

03:28.791 --> 03:31.201
they were not the ones
to build it.

03:31.285 --> 03:35.297
Standard belief is that the Inca
constructed Sacsayhuamán

03:35.456 --> 03:37.633
less than a thousand years ago.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.387
But in some of the earliest
Spanish chronicles

03:42.472 --> 03:46.642
it is said that the Spanish
were completely astounded

03:46.726 --> 03:50.229
by seeing this site,
and they asked the local Inca,

03:50.388 --> 03:52.898
"Did you build this?"
And the Inca replied,

03:52.982 --> 03:57.986
"No. This was here
when we arrived 500 years ago."

03:59.814 --> 04:03.316
NARRATOR: Many experts believe
Sacsayhuamán predates the Inca

04:03.409 --> 04:05.244
by thousands of years,

04:05.328 --> 04:09.656
and that the Inca built on top
of what came before.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.993
The Inca were
a Bronze Age civilization,

04:13.086 --> 04:17.998
and the stones at Sacsayhuamán
are metamorphosed limestone,

04:18.091 --> 04:21.093
which is much harder than bronze

04:21.177 --> 04:24.921
and could not be cut or shaped
using bronze tools.

04:25.006 --> 04:29.017
Inca built on top 'cause
you can tell a major difference

04:29.102 --> 04:31.594
between megalithic construction,

04:31.679 --> 04:34.264
where the stones fit
perfectly together,

04:34.348 --> 04:37.350
and the Inca, which is stones
piled on top of stones

04:37.443 --> 04:40.353
with mortar as filler.

04:40.438 --> 04:44.700
NARRATOR: But if Sacsayhuamán
really does predate the Inca--

04:44.784 --> 04:47.786
As the Inca themselves claimed--

04:47.870 --> 04:51.865
How could an even earlier
civilization have possessed

04:51.958 --> 04:54.293
far superior technology?

04:54.452 --> 04:58.297
The ancient Inca talk
about celestial beings

04:58.456 --> 05:01.708
who descended from the sky
a long time ago

05:01.792 --> 05:04.711
and imparted
the first knowledge of anything

05:04.795 --> 05:08.223
toward people of Earth.

05:08.382 --> 05:10.392
The ancient astronaut theory
suggests

05:10.476 --> 05:13.979
it was human beings
who built Sacsayhuamán

05:14.138 --> 05:17.974
but under the tutelage
of the extraterrestrials.

05:19.477 --> 05:22.821
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the astonishing megalithic stonework

05:22.980 --> 05:26.232
at Sacsayhuamán was achieved
with the help of

05:26.317 --> 05:30.495
alien technology, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest?

05:30.654 --> 05:35.167
And if so, might the Inca
have built on top of it--

05:35.326 --> 05:37.827
And established it
as a place of worship--

05:37.912 --> 05:41.164
Because they were somehow
aware of this?

05:41.257 --> 05:44.676
Sacsayhuamán is only
one of many places

05:44.835 --> 05:48.004
where ancient civilizations
have felt compelled

05:48.089 --> 05:50.849
to repeatedly build
their most sacred sites.

05:51.008 --> 05:54.761
In fact, there are locations
all around the world

05:54.854 --> 05:59.608
where successive cultures have
rebuilt over and over again.

05:59.767 --> 06:04.529
This has been going on since
the end of the last ice age

06:04.614 --> 06:08.200
with places like Gobekli Tepe
in Southeast Turkey,

06:08.359 --> 06:12.612
where the oldest
and most sophisticated monuments

06:12.705 --> 06:15.457
were built first on the bedrock.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.952
And then, eventually,
they would be covered over,

06:19.045 --> 06:23.289
and a new structure, new
enclosure built on top of them.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.875
Some of the most iconic
temple sites around the world,

06:25.960 --> 06:27.719
from Baalbek in Lebanon

06:27.878 --> 06:29.888
to the Temple of Horus
at Edfu in Egypt,

06:30.047 --> 06:33.392
are built on
the exact same location

06:33.551 --> 06:36.478
as former temples
that were reputed to be there.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.222
And the question is, why?

06:40.817 --> 06:44.060
NARRATOR: It is not uncommon for
people to repurpose an old structure

06:44.145 --> 06:48.240
or rebuild on its foundation
for practical purposes.

06:48.324 --> 06:52.160
But what ancient astronaut
theorists find intriguing

06:52.319 --> 06:54.329
is how the most sacred sites

06:54.414 --> 06:58.408
tend to remain sacred
over thousands of years.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.670
And of all the places
in the world

07:01.829 --> 07:04.256
where this phenomenon is found,

07:04.415 --> 07:07.167
perhaps there is none
more universally revered

07:07.251 --> 07:11.930
than the 35-acre platform in
Jerusalem known as Temple Mount.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.507
KATHLEEN McGOWAN:
The Temple Mount is arguably

07:14.600 --> 07:17.343
the most important
spiritual site in the world.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.189
All three of the primary
monotheistic religions have

07:21.274 --> 07:25.518
a connection to the events
of history that occurred

07:25.603 --> 07:27.937
- on top of the Temple Mount.
- (praying in Arabic)

07:28.030 --> 07:29.939
It's believed that,
"Is this the stone

07:30.032 --> 07:32.859
from which the world
originates?"

07:32.952 --> 07:36.955
It's a crucial element
in the Jewish tradition.

07:37.039 --> 07:41.201
When Isaac is offered up
for sacrifice by Abraham,

07:41.294 --> 07:44.537
this happens on the exposed
surface of Mount Moriah.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.539
That's the Temple Mount.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.542
For Muslims, this is where
the Prophet Muhammad

07:49.635 --> 07:51.544
ascends up to heaven.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.639
That stone is now covered over
by the Dome of the Rock,

07:54.724 --> 07:57.642
this very important
Islamic monument.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.886
NARRATOR:
The Dome of the Rock

07:59.979 --> 08:04.557
has stood at Temple Mount
for more than 1,300 years,

08:04.650 --> 08:07.819
but the very first temple
to occupy this sacred space

08:07.978 --> 08:10.655
was the legendary
Solomon's Temple,

08:10.814 --> 08:13.900
constructed upon order
of the Israelite king

08:13.993 --> 08:16.411
in the tenth century BC.

08:16.570 --> 08:20.832
According to the Hebrew Bible,
King Solomon received a message

08:20.917 --> 08:24.827
from the heavens to build
his temple on this spot.

08:24.912 --> 08:28.248
Its primary purpose was to house
the Ark of the Covenant,

08:28.341 --> 08:31.501
the golden box which carried
the two stone tablets

08:31.585 --> 08:34.346
inscribed with
the Ten Commandments,

08:34.430 --> 08:36.848
and which was said
to be God's earthly throne.

08:38.592 --> 08:42.595
Solomon has a communication
with the angel Michael,

08:42.688 --> 08:48.268
who comes and helps Solomon
to build this.

08:48.361 --> 08:53.114
And so, not only is this the
presence of God on this spot,

08:53.199 --> 08:56.609
it's God who's helping
in the building of this.

08:56.702 --> 09:00.205
And so that's part of what makes
that place so special.

09:00.364 --> 09:02.699
So literally divine.

09:02.792 --> 09:09.130
NARRATOR: Solomon's Temple was
destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC.

09:09.290 --> 09:13.885
But 70 years later, Jewish
exiles returning to Jerusalem

09:13.970 --> 09:17.556
built a new temple
on the exact same location.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.307
HUSSAIN: That's what
we call the Second Temple.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.219
And that temple survives
until the year 70 AD,

09:23.312 --> 09:25.305
when it's destroyed
by the Romans.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.892
Then, in the seventh century,
Muslims conquered Jerusalem.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.561
They build
the Dome of the Rock there.

09:31.645 --> 09:33.980
And, so, there's been
a long history

09:34.073 --> 09:37.242
of different people coming in,

09:37.401 --> 09:41.162
taking control, building,
rebuilding, uh, places there.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.249
McGOWAN: Solomon was
instructed to build the temple

09:44.333 --> 09:47.002
on this incredibly
important space.

09:47.161 --> 09:48.911
So why is this space important?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.673
Is it an energetic space?
Is it a portal?

09:51.832 --> 09:53.842
What we see over and over again

09:53.926 --> 09:57.262
with these profound religious
sites all over the world

09:57.421 --> 10:02.684
is, we see this reverence
for power places endures.

10:02.768 --> 10:06.012
From the earliest
human history to today,

10:06.105 --> 10:09.024
we're constantly building
on top of these places.

10:11.268 --> 10:13.853
NARRATOR: If a higher
power instructed King Solomon

10:13.946 --> 10:17.690
to build on Temple Mount,
could there be something special

10:17.775 --> 10:20.452
about this particular
location on Earth?

10:20.536 --> 10:22.370
And could the same be true

10:22.529 --> 10:25.624
for other places
around the world

10:25.783 --> 10:29.127
where successive cultures
built again and again?

10:29.286 --> 10:32.372
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

10:32.465 --> 10:35.792
one of the most astonishing
megalithic sites in the world,

10:35.885 --> 10:40.305
and stories about
its connection to the stars.

10:49.973 --> 10:52.776
NARRATOR:
Baalbek, Lebanon.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.238
Here, in the fertile
Bekaa Valley,

10:57.398 --> 10:59.482
stands what many consider

10:59.566 --> 11:02.160
to be the greatest ruin
of Roman antiquity...

11:03.829 --> 11:07.916
the colossal
Temple of Jupiter.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.836
But the imposing remains
that tower over the site today

11:11.995 --> 11:15.081
are only the latest
in a long line of structures

11:15.174 --> 11:17.917
erected on this spot.

11:18.001 --> 11:22.013
Archaeologists say the area
has been continually inhabited

11:22.098 --> 11:24.933
for at least 10,000 years,

11:25.017 --> 11:29.354
and no one knows who built
the first place of worship here.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.848
But according to legend,

11:31.941 --> 11:34.434
both Egyptian
and Assyrian conquerors

11:34.518 --> 11:37.278
erected sanctuaries on the site,

11:37.363 --> 11:40.273
followed by the Canaanites
and Phoenicians,

11:40.366 --> 11:46.204
who built a great temple here to
their god Baal around 2500 BC.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.458
Baalbek is one of those places

11:50.543 --> 11:54.036
where you have different people
over millennia

11:54.130 --> 11:57.382
building their shrines,
their temples,

11:57.466 --> 12:00.218
to their particular,
you know, gods or goddesses.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.804
You've got this temple
that's built by the Phoenicians

12:02.888 --> 12:06.808
for one of their deities Baal.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.552
Then Alexander the Great
conquers this area

12:09.636 --> 12:11.479
and-- surprise, surprise--

12:11.564 --> 12:15.224
Builds a temple
to the Greek gods.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.894
NARRATOR:
In the first century BC,

12:17.978 --> 12:21.322
roughly 300 years
after Alexander the Great,

12:21.482 --> 12:25.318
the Romans conquer Lebanon and
decide to erect a temple here

12:25.402 --> 12:27.412
to their chief god Jupiter.

12:27.571 --> 12:32.250
The main Roman temple
once boasted 54 columns,

12:32.409 --> 12:35.745
each a staggering 65 feet
in height.

12:35.829 --> 12:38.915
But while visitors to the ruins
may first notice

12:38.999 --> 12:41.417
the towering Roman columns,

12:41.502 --> 12:43.428
the most impressive feature
at Baalbek

12:43.512 --> 12:45.588
is its massive foundation.

12:45.672 --> 12:47.015
TSOUKALOS:
To this day,

12:47.099 --> 12:49.175
Baalbek, Lebanon has remained

12:49.268 --> 12:52.929
one of the most enduring
mysteries on planet Earth,

12:53.022 --> 12:56.608
because the masonry
that we find there

12:56.692 --> 13:00.436
is unparalleled compared
to the rest of the world.

13:00.521 --> 13:05.274
In fact, there are three stone
blocks called the trilithons,

13:05.359 --> 13:10.029
each weighing approximately
800 metric tons,

13:10.113 --> 13:13.115
which is 1.6 million pounds.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.963
COLLINS: Each of these blocks
is approximately 62 feet in length

13:19.048 --> 13:24.969
by about 14 feet in depth
and 12 feet in breadth.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.213
And they're not even
on the ground.

13:27.297 --> 13:31.726
So whoever placed them there
in ancient times

13:31.811 --> 13:33.886
would have had
to have raised them

13:33.979 --> 13:37.148
up to a height of about 20 feet.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.559
HENRY: Each of the stones
were quarried two miles away

13:39.643 --> 13:42.061
and put perfectly into place

13:42.145 --> 13:44.146
with such precision that you
can't even put a credit card

13:44.231 --> 13:47.316
or a needle in between
those massive blocks.

13:47.401 --> 13:50.829
NARRATOR: How ancient
people carved and moved

13:50.913 --> 13:53.239
such massive stones
is a question

13:53.323 --> 13:56.158
that baffles archaeologists
to this day.

13:56.243 --> 14:00.672
And equally as mysterious
is who placed them there.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.674
The giant blocks
in the foundation

14:02.833 --> 14:05.760
are clearly of a different
building style

14:05.845 --> 14:08.170
than the temples that sit above.

14:08.255 --> 14:11.516
And in my opinion, that platform
is not just ancient,

14:11.600 --> 14:14.102
it is prehistoric.

14:14.261 --> 14:18.431
NARRATOR: But if the platform
at Baalbek was constructed

14:18.515 --> 14:20.933
thousands of years
before the Romans arrived

14:21.018 --> 14:22.602
in the Bekaa Valley,

14:22.686 --> 14:25.187
why did they choose this
as the site

14:25.272 --> 14:28.441
to build their most
magnificent temple?

14:28.525 --> 14:32.036
One pioneering Russian scholar
has proposed

14:32.121 --> 14:35.456
that humans may have
been drawn to this location

14:35.541 --> 14:37.792
because it was the site
of one of Earth's

14:37.877 --> 14:40.879
earliest
extraterrestrial events.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.715
Scientist and mathematician
Dr. Matest Agrest

14:52.808 --> 14:55.635
sends shockwaves
through the world of academia

14:55.719 --> 14:57.979
with an article in which
he poses a new theory

14:58.063 --> 15:02.233
called "paleocontact,"
a precursor

15:02.318 --> 15:05.895
to what is known today
as the ancient astronaut theory,

15:05.988 --> 15:08.406
suggesting that certain
biblical texts

15:08.565 --> 15:13.152
could be interpreted as evidence
of alien visitation.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.413
And according to Agrest,

15:15.497 --> 15:19.334
one place where such visitations
occurred was Baalbek.

15:19.493 --> 15:21.252
HENRY:
Dr. Matest Agrest

15:21.411 --> 15:23.329
went into the ancient record,
the Book of Enoch

15:23.413 --> 15:26.591
and other Hebrew texts, and
noticed that there were beings

15:26.675 --> 15:30.419
coming from the sky or the stars
that came to Earth,

15:30.512 --> 15:32.931
and he came up
with a theory that they

15:33.015 --> 15:35.758
were extraterrestrial beings
who came to Earth

15:35.842 --> 15:38.678
to assist humanity in developing
advanced technology

15:38.762 --> 15:40.355
to build stone constructions

15:40.439 --> 15:43.432
such as what we see
at Baalbek in Lebanon.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.444
NARRATOR:
Agrest wrote about the watchers,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.196
a group of fallen angels

15:48.280 --> 15:50.365
who, according
to the biblical account,

15:50.449 --> 15:52.692
descended to Earth
at Mount Hermon,

15:52.776 --> 15:55.778
very near the site of Baalbek.

15:55.862 --> 15:58.864
Agrest suggested
that the watchers were, in fact,

15:58.949 --> 16:01.117
visitors from another planet,

16:01.201 --> 16:03.044
who built the megalithic
platform at Baalbek

16:03.203 --> 16:06.205
as a launchpad.

16:06.289 --> 16:08.800
He thought it was
a giant stone platform

16:08.959 --> 16:13.388
that spaceships could land on
and take off from.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.973
And this makes a lot of sense,

16:15.132 --> 16:18.726
because it's
so incredibly solid,

16:18.885 --> 16:21.729
with these huge stone
blocks in it,

16:21.888 --> 16:25.316
that even huge vehicles,
such as rockets,

16:25.401 --> 16:29.320
could land and take off
from this huge platform.

16:31.648 --> 16:33.074
NARRATOR: Two
decades after the publication

16:33.158 --> 16:35.651
of Agrest's
controversial article,

16:35.744 --> 16:38.738
author and researcher
Zecharia Sitchin

16:38.822 --> 16:40.990
came to the same conclusion
about Baalbek

16:41.074 --> 16:44.919
based on a 5,000-year-old
Sumerian text.

16:45.078 --> 16:49.331
The<i> Epic of Gilgamesh</i> tells
of a hero of superhuman strength

16:49.416 --> 16:53.085
who embarks
on an impossible quest.

16:53.178 --> 16:56.597
In the course of his journeys,
Gilgamesh arrives at a site

16:56.682 --> 16:59.425
where he encounters
otherworldly gods,

16:59.518 --> 17:04.939
a site that sounds suspiciously
like Baalbek.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.016
In the Sumerian
<i>Epic of Gilgamesh,</i>

17:07.100 --> 17:10.603
which is one of the great
and important legends,

17:10.687 --> 17:14.115
um, of human history,
we have the hero arriving

17:14.199 --> 17:17.201
in a place known
as the Landing Place.

17:18.695 --> 17:23.124
A space which allows the ascent
and the descent of beings

17:23.208 --> 17:26.044
from the heavens to the Earth.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.288
HENRY: Zecharia Sitchin
in the 1970s proposed,

17:29.381 --> 17:32.633
based on his reading
of the<i> Epic of Gilgamesh,</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:36.712
that Gilgamesh himself had seen
some sort of a spacecraft

17:36.797 --> 17:42.384
take off from a landing site and
pinpointed that site as Baalbek.

17:42.469 --> 17:44.479
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Baalbek

17:44.563 --> 17:47.231
was a landing pad
for alien visitors?

17:47.390 --> 17:51.986
And that it remained so
for thousands of years?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.730
Could that be why
so many ancient peoples,

17:54.815 --> 17:57.983
such as the Egyptians,
Assyrians, Canaanites,

17:58.068 --> 18:03.906
Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans,
all chose to build and rebuild

18:03.990 --> 18:08.086
some of their greatest temples
on this spot?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.079
Perhaps further clues
can be found

18:10.163 --> 18:12.090
by examining new discoveries

18:12.174 --> 18:14.667
made at a mysterious
ancient site

18:14.751 --> 18:17.929
on the other side of the world.

18:25.762 --> 18:28.347
NARRATOR: While searching
for the southern capital

18:28.431 --> 18:33.102
of the Inca Empire, Spanish
conquistador Pedro Cieza de León

18:33.195 --> 18:36.531
comes upon something
far stranger--

18:36.615 --> 18:40.284
A vast, abandoned city
near the shore of Lake Titicaca

18:40.369 --> 18:43.121
that the locals call Tiahuanaco.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.707
The ruined city
contains temples,

18:46.792 --> 18:51.370
huge megalithic structures,
and vast ceremonial buildings.

18:51.454 --> 18:53.381
ED BARNHART:
Tiahuanaco was huge.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.050
It spanned for miles and miles,

18:56.209 --> 19:00.379
and had a population of perhaps
as many as 20,000 people.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.058
NARRATOR: Among
Tiahuanaco's most impressive ruins

19:04.143 --> 19:08.137
is a carved monolith called
the Gateway to the Sun

19:08.230 --> 19:11.223
and a terraced mound
called Puma Punku,

19:11.316 --> 19:15.570
containing stone blocks cut
with extraordinary precision.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.565
According to archaeologists,
the Tiahuanaco complex

19:19.649 --> 19:22.651
once served as the capital
of a sprawling empire

19:22.736 --> 19:26.998
that rose and fell
centuries before the Inca.

19:27.082 --> 19:31.169
TSOUKALOS: This is why we
have the term called the pre-Inca.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.671
But who were the pre-Inca?

19:33.755 --> 19:36.591
And this is where
it gets interesting,

19:36.675 --> 19:39.677
because pre-Inca construction

19:39.761 --> 19:43.764
is more sophisticated
than Inca construction.

19:43.924 --> 19:47.935
NARRATOR: While some mainstream
historians say the site dates back

19:48.020 --> 19:53.182
only to the Bronze Age,
others maintain it is far older.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.602
TSOUKALOS: Arthur Posnanski
spent an exorbitant amount of time

19:56.695 --> 20:00.022
at Tiahuanaco, and he calculated

20:00.106 --> 20:03.868
an actual origin date
of Tiahuanaco,

20:03.952 --> 20:09.448
which he based
to be around 12,500 BC,

20:09.541 --> 20:13.628
which is an incredible time,
because at that time,

20:13.787 --> 20:15.454
according to mainstream
archaeology,

20:15.538 --> 20:17.465
we were munching on bananas.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.885
HENRY: So, it opens up
the possibility that this site

20:20.969 --> 20:25.223
is vastly more ancient
than we're led to believe.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.975
And we're only just now
beginning to discover

20:28.060 --> 20:29.977
the complete history
of that site.

20:32.472 --> 20:35.057
NARRATOR: Some experts
believe that the builders of Tiahuanaco

20:35.141 --> 20:38.477
were the ancestors
of the local Aymara people

20:38.561 --> 20:40.980
who still live
in the area today.

20:41.073 --> 20:45.234
But many of the Aymara
themselves disagree.

20:45.318 --> 20:49.822
TSOUKALOS: The local population,
the ancient Aymara culture, say,

20:49.915 --> 20:52.157
"It was not us who built this.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.670
It was the gods.<i> Los dioses."</i>

20:55.829 --> 20:58.839
NARRATOR: Recently, the
mystery of who built Tiahuanaco

20:58.924 --> 21:01.676
only deepened
with a staggering discovery

21:01.835 --> 21:05.179
not within the city
but beneath it.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.683
2017.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.343
Researchers from UNESCO,

21:11.428 --> 21:14.605
working with local
archaeologists at Tiahuanaco,

21:14.690 --> 21:17.108
announce findings
that send shockwaves

21:17.192 --> 21:19.110
through the world
of archaeology.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.697
While analyzing
satellite imagery

21:22.856 --> 21:26.284
and ground-penetrating radar
of the Tiahuanaco site,

21:26.443 --> 21:29.445
they find dozens
of previously unknown structures

21:29.529 --> 21:31.872
buried virtually everywhere
they look.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.118
What this aerial technology
has found

21:36.202 --> 21:41.040
is 34 acres of terraced mounds,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.384
underground platforms,

21:43.468 --> 21:46.721
and elements
of a pyramid complex.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.716
Undated constructions
reveal that temples

21:50.800 --> 21:56.647
may have taken the form of
industrial-strength platforms,

21:56.732 --> 22:00.059
and this begs the question,
why are the bases,

22:00.143 --> 22:03.821
these platforms,
so industrial-strength?

22:03.980 --> 22:09.577
It's as though they were built
to support extreme weight.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.747
So, originally, there could have
been one large mega-platform,

22:12.906 --> 22:16.325
similar to what we find
at Baalbek.

22:16.409 --> 22:19.754
This could have belonged
to a much earlier civilization.

22:22.082 --> 22:25.009
NARRATOR: If Tiahuanaco
is yet another sacred site

22:25.093 --> 22:28.337
where successive cultures
built temples atop the ruins

22:28.430 --> 22:30.681
of far earlier structures,

22:30.840 --> 22:33.175
is it possible
that there is a connection

22:33.259 --> 22:36.011
to extraterrestrial visitation?

22:36.096 --> 22:40.265
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

22:40.350 --> 22:43.018
Tiahuanaco's most
mysterious ruins,

22:43.103 --> 22:46.021
at Puma Punku,
provide the best evidence

22:46.106 --> 22:48.107
that the site was
not only significant

22:48.191 --> 22:50.034
to the native people

22:50.118 --> 22:54.288
but also
to otherworldly visitors.

22:54.447 --> 22:58.700
Puma Punku is, to me, the most
important place on Earth

22:58.785 --> 23:03.631
as far as an extraterrestrial
visitation would be concerned.

23:03.790 --> 23:06.384
The construction style
at Puma Punku

23:06.468 --> 23:11.380
does not exist
anywhere else on Earth.

23:11.464 --> 23:14.299
HENRY: These stones, some
of them weighing a hundred tons,

23:14.384 --> 23:18.053
are made of andesite
and other hard materials

23:18.138 --> 23:21.223
that today we would use
a diamond-tip drill

23:21.316 --> 23:23.901
in order to shape or mold
such stones.

23:24.060 --> 23:27.146
How did they do it
with hammers and chisels?

23:27.230 --> 23:31.066
NARRATOR: Like the
foundation stones beneath Baalbek

23:31.159 --> 23:33.902
and the megalithic blocks
of Sacsayhuamán,

23:33.995 --> 23:36.488
the buried platforms
beneath Puma Punku

23:36.581 --> 23:39.825
raise a provocative question:

23:39.918 --> 23:41.836
Why were the largest, heaviest

23:41.920 --> 23:44.246
and most sophisticated parts
of these sites

23:44.339 --> 23:49.001
those that date back
farthest in time?

23:49.085 --> 23:52.171
According to ancient astronaut
theorists,

23:52.255 --> 23:54.515
more than 12,000 years ago,

23:54.674 --> 23:57.017
human civilizations
existed on Earth

23:57.177 --> 23:59.687
that possessed
incredible technology

23:59.771 --> 24:05.025
given to them
by extraterrestrial beings.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.111
The ancient Egyptians
referred to

24:07.195 --> 24:09.688
a-a time called
the "First Time,"

24:09.781 --> 24:15.194
when the gods, extraterrestrial
beings, walked among men.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.455
Pre-10,000 BC.

24:17.614 --> 24:20.616
CHILDRESS:
We have authentic legends

24:20.700 --> 24:22.868
about these lost lands
and lost worlds.

24:22.961 --> 24:26.297
And that extraterrestrials
were here at the same time.

24:26.456 --> 24:28.040
We have these
all over the world.

24:28.124 --> 24:30.959
We have the stories
of Atlantis and Lemuria.

24:31.044 --> 24:35.055
Many cultures around the world
have, also, these same legends

24:35.140 --> 24:37.049
and lores and myths
of cataclysms.

24:37.133 --> 24:39.551
The Scandinavians have this.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.721
Also, we have the flood of Noah.

24:42.805 --> 24:46.567
We have-- the Greeks
also have tales of a flood.

24:48.228 --> 24:49.487
COLLINS:
What we now know

24:49.646 --> 24:52.814
from incredible amount
of evidence

24:52.899 --> 24:55.734
coming from every part
of the world,

24:55.818 --> 25:00.489
is around 10,800 BC,

25:00.582 --> 25:04.752
the Earth suffered a terrible,
uh, catastrophe

25:04.836 --> 25:07.254
in the form of a comet impact

25:07.413 --> 25:10.508
known as
the Younger Dryas event.

25:11.918 --> 25:15.587
And this devastated every
continent of the world

25:15.672 --> 25:18.924
with fires and floods.

25:19.008 --> 25:21.927
CHILDRESS: So, now it looks like
we're looking at a-a secret history

25:22.020 --> 25:23.687
of planet Earth,

25:23.846 --> 25:27.599
one where there's
extraterrestrial intervention.

25:27.692 --> 25:32.363
And there were civilizations
and activities going on then,

25:32.522 --> 25:35.699
and they were destroyed
in a cataclysmic flood.

25:35.784 --> 25:41.113
HENRY: From Baalbek in Lebanon
to the Temple Mount to Puma Punku,

25:41.197 --> 25:43.865
some of these sites
are thought to be the locations

25:43.959 --> 25:46.043
where pre-flood temples
once existed.

25:46.202 --> 25:49.964
So, after the cataclysm, people
are regaining civilization,

25:50.048 --> 25:52.550
and they go back
to the exact same location

25:52.634 --> 25:55.469
as previous temples and-and
rebuild the temple there.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.630
NARRATOR: Could it be
that the most ancient structures

25:58.715 --> 26:01.967
found at sacred sites
all over the world

26:02.060 --> 26:05.721
belonged to civilizations
that have been lost to history?

26:05.814 --> 26:08.649
Civilizations
where extraterrestrials

26:08.808 --> 26:10.392
once lived among humans

26:10.485 --> 26:14.980
before falling victim
to a cataclysmic event?

26:15.073 --> 26:18.158
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

26:18.243 --> 26:20.911
a site in Peru where the Inca
claimed to have had

26:21.070 --> 26:24.832
a direct line of communication
with the gods.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.048
NARRATOR:
Cuzco, Peru.

26:36.252 --> 26:38.512
In the heart
of the ancient Incan capital

26:38.597 --> 26:41.506
stands the Convent
of Santo Domingo,

26:41.600 --> 26:46.437
a Spanish church constructed
roughly 400 years ago.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.273
But still visible beneath
the church are the remnants

26:49.432 --> 26:52.693
of an older and far more
impressive structure:

26:52.852 --> 26:57.022
the Incan temple of Coricancha.

26:57.106 --> 26:59.199
TOK THOMPSON: Coricancha
is probably the premier site

26:59.359 --> 27:01.285
for the ancient
Incan civilization.

27:02.862 --> 27:05.456
This was the crowning jewel
of their empire.

27:05.540 --> 27:09.543
Um, it, uh, reflected
the Incan, uh, political power.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.120
As well as the religious power.

27:12.213 --> 27:17.709
BARNHART: It had gold plating
all along its walls, inside and out.

27:17.794 --> 27:20.462
So it glowed in the Sun.

27:20.555 --> 27:23.557
And it was a very
imposing structure.

27:23.716 --> 27:27.728
It had a base that was
a curved wall

27:27.812 --> 27:30.981
with a big garden at the bottom.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.734
And inside,
it had a number of temples.

27:35.978 --> 27:37.979
(men yelling, swords clanging)

27:38.073 --> 27:40.232
NARRATOR:
After the Spanish conquistadors

27:40.316 --> 27:44.152
sacked Cuzco
in November of 1533,

27:44.237 --> 27:47.748
they demolished the Coricancha
and built a convent and church

27:47.832 --> 27:50.659
on its monumental foundation.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.671
All that's left
of the original structure

27:53.830 --> 27:55.914
is the impressive stonework
of the base

27:55.998 --> 27:58.834
and some underground rooms.

27:58.927 --> 28:02.763
But some experts believe
the surviving stonework

28:02.847 --> 28:06.767
of the Coricancha is too
monumental and sophisticated

28:06.926 --> 28:10.095
to have been achieved with the
Bronze Age tools of the Inca,

28:10.188 --> 28:14.191
and was built instead by an
earlier, unknown civilization.

28:16.436 --> 28:18.603
NEWMAN:
So, with the Coricancha, we have

28:18.697 --> 28:21.440
good evidence that when the Inca
arrived in this area,

28:21.533 --> 28:24.201
there was already an earlier
megalithic temple there.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.452
They were actually
building on something

28:25.611 --> 28:26.954
that was already there,

28:27.038 --> 28:28.622
like, possibly
an ancient platform,

28:28.707 --> 28:30.365
possibly an underground temple,

28:30.450 --> 28:32.501
because there's evidence
of tunnels in this area.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.455
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

28:36.548 --> 28:40.542
this raises the same question
posed by Baalbek and Tiahuanaco:

28:40.635 --> 28:42.886
why did ancient people
repeatedly build

28:43.045 --> 28:46.640
temple after temple
on the same sacred spot?

28:46.799 --> 28:50.477
And some believe that
in the case of the Coricancha,

28:50.562 --> 28:54.389
Inca legends may provide
a pivotal clue.

28:54.474 --> 28:57.559
Because tradition states
that a special spot

28:57.643 --> 29:00.070
within the Coricancha
allowed communication

29:00.155 --> 29:02.573
directly with the heavens,

29:02.657 --> 29:05.901
but only when it was activated
by the most sacred relic

29:05.994 --> 29:09.654
in the Inca world,
a mysterious golden disc

29:09.739 --> 29:13.408
called the Inti Punchaco.

29:13.493 --> 29:18.005
The most legendary relic
of any Peruvian era

29:18.089 --> 29:20.999
was said to have been kept
in the original Coricancha.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.920
This was the Inti Punchaco.

29:25.004 --> 29:29.674
This sun disc,
this golden artifact,

29:29.759 --> 29:32.686
allowed whoever possessed it

29:32.771 --> 29:36.848
to commune directly
with the gods.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.769
NARRATOR: According to
the Inca, within the Coricancha,

29:40.853 --> 29:43.947
the Inti Punchaco disc
allowed direct contact

29:44.106 --> 29:46.441
with their creator god
Viracocha.

29:46.526 --> 29:49.787
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

29:49.871 --> 29:51.863
that the specific placement
of it

29:51.956 --> 29:54.291
was important because it
may have been receiving a signal

29:54.375 --> 29:56.701
from beyond Earth.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.464
And they believe the exact spot
where it was activated

30:00.623 --> 30:03.458
still exists in a chamber
of the Coricancha

30:03.543 --> 30:07.879
that was spared destruction
by the Spanish.

30:07.964 --> 30:11.391
In the Coricancha
is this special niche,

30:11.551 --> 30:15.646
and today they've covered it
with a Plexiglas sheet,

30:15.805 --> 30:18.816
but it has blocks
that are perfectly cut

30:18.900 --> 30:22.978
and articulated in unusual ways,
little notches and things,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.897
plus drilled holes that go
through it,

30:25.990 --> 30:29.743
which seem to be for
electric cables or something.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.914
So it would appear
that some device

30:33.998 --> 30:38.326
was placed into this niche
in the wall

30:38.419 --> 30:42.747
that was like a monitor
of some kind.

30:42.832 --> 30:45.676
And they've chosen this spot.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.004
And all for reasons
that we do not understand.

30:49.088 --> 30:52.173
NEWMAN: So, could it
be that at the Coricancha,

30:52.258 --> 30:56.011
there was a sacred kind of
part of the site there

30:56.095 --> 30:58.689
where they were connecting
with the gods?

30:58.773 --> 31:02.434
Actually something in the land,
like a-a magnetic hot spot

31:02.518 --> 31:05.604
or a vortex that the Inca

31:05.697 --> 31:08.690
and then later the Spanish
became aware of.

31:08.783 --> 31:13.445
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
ancient Peruvians possessed a device

31:13.538 --> 31:18.208
that allowed them to communicate
with beings from beyond Earth?

31:18.367 --> 31:21.620
And that the location
of the Coricancha

31:21.704 --> 31:25.373
was essential to activating
this technology?

31:25.458 --> 31:29.127
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

31:29.220 --> 31:33.131
and suggest that clues
as to just how such a technology

31:33.224 --> 31:35.809
might have worked can be found
by examining

31:35.894 --> 31:38.478
mysterious magnetic
anomalies detected

31:38.563 --> 31:42.900
at one of the most remote
ancient sites in the world.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.148
NARRATOR: In the middle
of the Pacific Ocean,

31:50.241 --> 31:54.161
roughly 2,500 miles
northeast of Australia,

31:54.245 --> 31:58.990
lie the ruins of a once
great ancient city Nan Madol.

31:59.075 --> 32:01.668
Consisting of hundreds
of man-made islets

32:01.753 --> 32:04.412
off the eastern coast
of Micronesia,

32:04.497 --> 32:09.843
it has been dubbed the
"Eighth Wonder of the World."

32:10.002 --> 32:13.338
The site of Nan Madol on the
island of Pohnpei in Micronesia

32:13.431 --> 32:15.766
is one of the strangest places
on the planet.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.103
It's an 11-square-mile complex

32:20.188 --> 32:24.775
composed of over 250 million
tons of basalt logs...

32:26.444 --> 32:30.689
floating on a submerged
coral reef.

32:30.773 --> 32:33.367
They are 18 feet long,
four feet in diameter,

32:33.451 --> 32:36.787
and are stacked
40 feet up in the air.

32:39.115 --> 32:42.084
Why did they do this?
And how did they do this?

32:44.620 --> 32:47.539
NARRATOR: Today, the site
lies abandoned and shunned

32:47.632 --> 32:51.218
by the local Micronesians,
who consider it haunted.

32:51.302 --> 32:55.055
THOMPSON: Nan Madol is one
of these disappeared civilizations.

32:55.214 --> 32:57.382
It's fascinatingly interesting.

32:57.466 --> 32:59.134
This seemed to have been
the center of power

32:59.227 --> 33:01.469
of a, uh, major civilization.

33:01.554 --> 33:04.398
And yet it also seems
that it might have been built

33:04.482 --> 33:09.144
on earlier civilizations
that are lost in time.

33:09.228 --> 33:13.148
NARRATOR: Since stone
is difficult to accurately date,

33:13.232 --> 33:15.575
no one knows for certain
when it was constructed

33:15.735 --> 33:17.494
or how it was built.

33:17.653 --> 33:20.822
TSOUKALOS: When you
ask the local population,

33:20.906 --> 33:24.325
"Where were
these blocks quarried?"

33:24.410 --> 33:27.587
In unison, they will tell you,
from across the island

33:27.672 --> 33:32.250
and that they were flown
across the island.

33:32.334 --> 33:34.511
According to legend,

33:34.595 --> 33:37.848
twin sorcerers
of giant proportions

33:38.007 --> 33:42.093
came down from the sky
and floated above the site

33:42.186 --> 33:47.107
and positioned the basalt
columns as they desired,

33:47.266 --> 33:52.103
a legend that's very similar
to the same story at Puma Punku.

33:52.188 --> 33:55.106
TSOUKALOS: But when
I hear stories like that,

33:55.191 --> 33:58.702
I wonder, well,
perhaps we have another example

33:58.786 --> 34:03.290
of what I refer to
as misunderstood technology.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.710
NARRATOR: As with
other sites like Puma Punku,

34:06.869 --> 34:09.796
Baalbek and the Coricancha,
legend says

34:09.955 --> 34:13.133
that these structures were not
the first to exist here,

34:13.217 --> 34:17.212
but instead were built
above a much older city.

34:17.305 --> 34:19.631
GOUGH:
The mystery of Nan Madol

34:19.724 --> 34:24.311
is even more intriguing when
we factor in the local legend

34:24.470 --> 34:28.565
that states that it was built
on an earlier civilization

34:28.649 --> 34:30.975
called the Kanamwayso,

34:31.060 --> 34:34.821
which is submerged below water

34:34.906 --> 34:39.242
but still has those
same basalt megaliths.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.820
NARRATOR: Objects that
appear to be basalt columns

34:41.913 --> 34:45.916
have in fact been found
beneath the ocean at Nan Madol,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.243
and those who have studied
the columns

34:48.336 --> 34:50.662
both above and below the water

34:50.755 --> 34:55.083
have discovered a curious
electromagnetic anomaly.

34:55.167 --> 34:59.337
CHILDRESS: There's a strong
magnetic field in every single one

34:59.421 --> 35:03.683
of the 250 million tons
of basalt there.

35:03.843 --> 35:08.438
You can take a compass and run
it along these basalt blocks,

35:08.523 --> 35:13.184
and your compass will just spin
as you move it along the blocks.

35:13.277 --> 35:18.782
Also, it's thought that the site
itself is a special power spot

35:18.866 --> 35:25.205
and an energy vortex, and that's
why Nan Madol is built there.

35:25.364 --> 35:29.868
And this legendary sunken city
called Kanamwayso as well.

35:29.952 --> 35:34.381
TSOUKALOS: The local population
also reports many, many sightings

35:34.465 --> 35:37.968
of orbs and lights

35:38.052 --> 35:42.213
that have been seen
hovering around Nan Madol.

35:42.298 --> 35:45.800
Is it because of the magnetic
spectrum of Earth?

35:45.885 --> 35:49.470
And you have to wonder
if, through magnetism,

35:49.555 --> 35:51.806
the stones were transported
in the first place,

35:51.891 --> 35:53.316
'cause they were transported
through the air.

35:55.227 --> 35:57.896
NARRATOR: Some ancient
astronaut theorists suggest

35:57.989 --> 36:01.983
that elevated electromagnetic
energy present at Nan Madol

36:02.076 --> 36:04.161
was not only a powerful tool

36:04.245 --> 36:07.164
used to move
the giant basalt columns,

36:07.323 --> 36:09.666
but that it may also
have been the reason

36:09.825 --> 36:12.169
that extraterrestrials
helped the locals

36:12.253 --> 36:14.504
to build here
in the first place.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.164
NEWMAN:
Could it be that there was

36:16.248 --> 36:19.426
a sacred kind of part
of the site there,

36:19.510 --> 36:21.502
where they were
connecting with the gods?

36:21.587 --> 36:24.681
You know, not just through
visionary experiences,

36:24.765 --> 36:26.433
but actually something
in the land,

36:26.517 --> 36:30.178
like a-a magnetic hot spot
or a vortex?

36:30.262 --> 36:33.681
TAYLOR: We hear the word
"vortex" in science fiction,

36:33.774 --> 36:35.850
popular culture all the time.

36:35.935 --> 36:40.021
And a vortex is just
a mathematical thing

36:40.114 --> 36:42.607
that describes
a swirling motion.

36:42.700 --> 36:46.027
An electromagnetic field
can be formed in a vortex.

36:46.111 --> 36:49.623
You could create a vortex
that would enable

36:49.707 --> 36:52.784
transporting information
from somewhere else to here

36:52.877 --> 36:55.045
at the speed of light or faster
than the speed of light.

36:55.204 --> 36:57.297
And if there are places
on the Earth

36:57.381 --> 37:00.041
where these types of vortexes
may be stronger than others,

37:00.125 --> 37:03.386
you could see people going there
to build structures

37:03.471 --> 37:05.889
that maybe altered

37:06.048 --> 37:08.216
the electromagnetic field
of the local environment.

37:08.309 --> 37:13.480
NEWMAN: Was there even
some kind of portal or vortex present

37:13.639 --> 37:15.807
in some of these sacred places?

37:15.891 --> 37:19.060
If that's the case,
we have to question

37:19.144 --> 37:25.066
these principles of oracle
sites, megalithic temples.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.744
Were they built to harness this,

37:27.828 --> 37:29.570
to be these
communication portals

37:29.655 --> 37:32.490
between these different places?

37:32.574 --> 37:34.167
There is no question in my mind

37:34.252 --> 37:36.995
that these are much older sites
than we think,

37:37.088 --> 37:40.006
and that they were spots for
extraterrestrial communication

37:40.091 --> 37:43.334
a long, long time ago.

37:43.419 --> 37:47.681
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
certain locations around the world

37:47.765 --> 37:51.601
act as vortexes
of electromagnetic energy?

37:51.686 --> 37:54.345
And that ancient people built
their most sacred sites

37:54.430 --> 37:56.180
in these very spots

37:56.274 --> 38:00.026
in order to communicate
with otherworldly beings?

38:00.111 --> 38:03.271
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

38:03.355 --> 38:06.700
that although this notion
may sound far-fetched,

38:06.784 --> 38:09.610
scientists at NASA recently
found evidence

38:09.704 --> 38:12.914
that such portals
really do exist.

38:23.876 --> 38:27.053
NARRATOR: NASA makes a
groundbreaking announcement,

38:27.212 --> 38:30.048
that there is indisputable
evidence of magnetic portals

38:30.132 --> 38:32.300
connecting the Earth
and the Sun.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.386
These portals open
every eight minutes

38:35.471 --> 38:37.972
and allow the transfer
of high-energy particles

38:38.065 --> 38:40.558
between the two
celestial bodies.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.736
TAYLOR: So, you have these
two really powerful magnets,

38:42.820 --> 38:44.321
the Earth and the Sun,

38:44.480 --> 38:46.814
and their field lines
are crossing each other.

38:46.899 --> 38:49.909
But every now and then,
for whatever reason,

38:50.069 --> 38:52.320
we have these flux transfer
events where the field lines

38:52.404 --> 38:54.489
will actually connect
to each other

38:54.573 --> 38:57.909
and they create a pathway for
the magnetic field of the Sun

38:57.993 --> 39:00.587
to literally be connected to
the magnetic field of the Earth.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.247
And it's even been referred to
in the scientific literature

39:03.332 --> 39:05.592
as magnetic portals.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.920
We actually have a connection
that could be a transit

39:09.013 --> 39:13.091
to or a pathway for information
to travel from the Sun

39:13.175 --> 39:15.093
to the Earth or vice versa.

39:15.177 --> 39:19.105
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists have long been intrigued

39:19.190 --> 39:21.691
by the concept
of electromagnetic portals,

39:21.776 --> 39:23.610
since in theory
they could provide

39:23.694 --> 39:27.772
a means of communicating,
or even traveling rapidly,

39:27.856 --> 39:30.658
across the vast distances
of space.

39:32.444 --> 39:36.539
The NASA discovery poses
an intriguing question:

39:36.624 --> 39:39.459
could sites around the world,
where successive cultures

39:39.618 --> 39:44.789
built their most sacred temples,
be locations that facilitate

39:44.873 --> 39:48.718
the creation
of magnetic portals?

39:48.803 --> 39:53.381
TAYLOR: Could a civilization
with a more advanced knowledge

39:53.474 --> 39:55.633
of physics
than we have currently

39:55.726 --> 40:00.054
make use of this flux transfer,
of these magnetic field lines

40:00.139 --> 40:04.058
connecting between their star
and other planets?

40:04.143 --> 40:07.654
Could it create a means
of traveling quickly

40:07.738 --> 40:09.647
from one point to the other
between them?

40:09.731 --> 40:11.399
Or maybe even something else

40:11.483 --> 40:13.410
that we just haven't
discovered yet.

40:14.662 --> 40:15.995
NEWMAN:
Maybe these sites

40:16.080 --> 40:18.239
were kind of manipulating
the energies

40:18.323 --> 40:21.742
of the cosmos and the Earth
to open these portals up

40:21.827 --> 40:23.828
for this kind of purpose.

40:23.921 --> 40:28.082
And what or who were they
really communicating with?

40:28.167 --> 40:30.677
Was it really the gods?
Was it the ancestors?

40:30.761 --> 40:34.347
Or was it otherworldly beings?

40:34.432 --> 40:37.425
NARRATOR:
Could Baalbek, Temple Mount,

40:37.518 --> 40:40.094
Puma Punku, the Coricancha,

40:40.179 --> 40:43.097
and other sites around the world
where sacred structures

40:43.182 --> 40:45.275
have been built again and again

40:45.359 --> 40:50.188
have electromagnetic properties
similar to Nan Madol?

40:50.281 --> 40:53.941
Properties that could be
harnessed to create gateways

40:54.034 --> 40:56.786
to connect
with otherworldly beings?

40:56.945 --> 40:59.289
McGOWAN:
Over and over, around the world,

40:59.373 --> 41:01.207
from the beginning of time
to now,

41:01.292 --> 41:04.878
we see that sacred sites
and power points

41:04.962 --> 41:07.881
have been marked by humankind.

41:07.965 --> 41:11.134
Temples have been built
to communicate

41:11.218 --> 41:14.471
from Earth to heaven.

41:14.630 --> 41:18.633
Quite clearly,
these places are somewhere

41:18.717 --> 41:20.635
that we keep coming back to.

41:20.719 --> 41:23.897
We call them portals,
we call them vortexes.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.891
They are gateways
onto another world,

41:26.975 --> 41:29.060
and they are
very, very important

41:29.144 --> 41:34.282
not just for human experience
but for evolution itself.

41:35.901 --> 41:38.328
NARRATOR: Are humans
drawn to certain locations on Earth

41:38.412 --> 41:40.988
by a magnetic force?

41:41.073 --> 41:44.250
Do we build
our most sacred temples

41:44.335 --> 41:47.078
on the same sites
again and again

41:47.171 --> 41:51.341
because these locations
connect us to the cosmos?

41:51.425 --> 41:55.753
Perhaps, as we continue to
unearth even more ancient ruins,

41:55.837 --> 41:57.755
we will come
to better understand

41:57.839 --> 42:01.017
our connection to the universe

42:01.101 --> 42:05.188
and the truth about
our extraterrestrial past.
