00:17.267 --> 00:20.395
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.731
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.814 --> 00:26.359
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.448
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.995
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.496
-A scary tale.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.373
-A strange tale.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.751
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.213
-You really think you can handle it?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.392
Once upon a time,
a young girl returned to the village

00:59.476 --> 01:01.352
she had come to call home…

01:03.772 --> 01:07.275
…and desperately tried
to remove the soot from her clothes.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.780
Did the warlock know
she had learned his secret?

01:11.863 --> 01:15.283
If he did, she was in immediate
and horrifying danger.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.619
Ooh, my favorite kind!

01:17.702 --> 01:21.289
And if he didn't, well,
she was still in horrifying danger.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.626
This is bad, really bad.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.670
What do you think, brushy?

01:27.754 --> 01:31.299
Should I stay here?
Hansel's out there somewhere.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.676
But so is that evil warlock.

01:35.887 --> 01:40.517
You're right, I shouldn't base
big decisions on advice from brushes.

01:42.685 --> 01:46.564
Anyway, if I stay here for now,
Widow Fischer can keep me safe.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.651
Ugh, poor kid, talking to her brush?

01:50.819 --> 01:55.073
Will you talk some sense into this fish?
She's being a total jerk.

01:55.698 --> 01:56.783
Widow Fischer?

01:56.866 --> 02:00.537
Oh, how many times do I got to tell you,
call me Widow Fischer.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.539
I have to tell you something.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.459
Last night, after you told me
not to go into the deep dark woods…

02:06.543 --> 02:08.878
You went anyway?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.841
Oh, yeah, I know, kid,
I was your age once.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.594
Probably. Well, I must have been, right?
Let's go ask the fish.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.765
-I went to that young man's house. He's…

02:20.849 --> 02:23.184
He-- He's a warlock, and he…

02:23.893 --> 02:25.687
he's been…

02:25.770 --> 02:27.147
Oh, shh-shh-shh-shh.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.733
He's been kidnapping girls!
So many of them!

02:30.817 --> 02:33.903
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, this is nuts.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.946
Like nuts nuts.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.657
And if I think it's nuts,
I mean, wow, right?

02:37.740 --> 02:40.869
He pulls birds out of them,
and the birds are their souls,

02:40.952 --> 02:44.622
and he steals them to get magic to trick
more girls so he can get more magic.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.666
He keeps all the soul doves in cages and…

02:46.749 --> 02:50.003
Haven't you noticed
there are hardly any girls in the village?

02:50.086 --> 02:52.463
There's, like, 30 boys and two girls!

02:52.547 --> 02:56.759
Well, I spend surprisingly little time
organizing children by gender.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.680
The warlock took the girls! And then
he erased everyone's memory of them!

03:00.763 --> 03:02.807
Okay, okay, hello.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.769
If someone erased my memory,
I would remember it, right?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.689
-Ugh!
-Okay, Gretel.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.650
That handsome young man
has lived in this village

03:12.734 --> 03:14.652
for over a hundred years.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.489
If my great-grandmother wasn't suspicious
of him, well, why should I be?

03:18.573 --> 03:21.492
-But-- But-- But--
-Why don't you go have a nap?

03:21.576 --> 03:25.246
And I'm gonna bring you some
of me nice, hot fish tea.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.625
Does she sound crazy to you too,
Tuna McSalmonstein?

03:28.708 --> 03:29.584
Yeah, a little.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.711
Hey! Shh. Not so loud.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.840
Clearly, Gretel would receive
no help from Widow Fischer.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.802
Yeah, but at least she wasn't
sitting on a couch covered in human skin,

03:39.886 --> 03:41.304
waiting to see the Devil.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
-Huh?

03:46.142 --> 03:47.352
-Agh!

03:50.104 --> 03:52.815
-Eugh!
-Hey! Could you scooch over?

03:53.399 --> 03:54.234
Ugh!

03:54.317 --> 03:57.403
-How would you like a butt in your face?

03:57.487 --> 04:01.616
Hansel was just about to wonder
aloud how things could get worse, when…

04:07.121 --> 04:08.957
Soon, Hansel couldn't stand it.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.085
He had to know what that screaming was,
even if it killed him.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.127
-Agh!

04:16.464 --> 04:18.383
-Meanwhile…

04:18.466 --> 04:21.636
No, not meanwhile.
I wanna see what happens.

04:21.719 --> 04:25.765
Patience. Gretel did what had
always been comfortable for her,

04:26.349 --> 04:28.184
she started planning.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.187
This is fine.
I can think my way out of this.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.657
Agh!

04:44.325 --> 04:45.618
Here's the plan,

04:45.702 --> 04:48.913
get the heck out of here,
don't look back, find Hansel!

04:58.172 --> 05:01.217
-Ah, my beloverated grandmother…

05:01.301 --> 05:03.720
-…you have the voice of an angel.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.098
A-- A fallen angel, of course.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.310
Oh, you little devil.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.398
What's that?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.901
Do I smell… …human?

05:22.572 --> 05:26.659
Of course you do.
What do you think we're having for dinner?

05:27.243 --> 05:31.164
-And for dessert, baby bum muffins.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.750
-You're so good to me, Grandmother.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.168
-Oh.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.963
By good I mean evil…
… naturalistically.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.676
-I tell you, it has been a day.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.305
I had to deliver
more of my golden hairs to that warlock

05:47.388 --> 05:49.766
-who makes magic twine out of them.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.601
Ugh, it's exhaustivating.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.562
He just goes on and on and on

05:54.645 --> 05:57.398
about his collection of soul doves.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.984
Nobody cares about your collection, buddy.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.987
Not even other soul dove collectors.
Give it a rest.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.324
Man, I wish I'd never
made a deal with that guy.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.493
Relax, dear.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.454
You just need a good rest.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.956
Let me soothe you to sleep.

06:16.959 --> 06:17.835
Ugh!

06:21.297 --> 06:24.675
-Oh, dear little sausage.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.182
-Hansel saw his chance.

06:31.766 --> 06:35.186
He could escape if he could steal
three of the Devil's golden hairs.

06:51.869 --> 06:52.703
Phew.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.547
-There's that human smell again.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.301
Oh, right.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.690
But then,
Hansel did something unusual for him.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.443
Instead of taking action…

07:26.028 --> 07:28.406
…he thought about it.

07:33.369 --> 07:37.165
Uh, if I pluck his hairs,
he'll wake up and turn me into furniture!

07:37.248 --> 07:38.749
I'm one of the lucky ones.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.710
I mean, have you met the toilet?

07:40.793 --> 07:42.170
Ugh.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.504
What would Gretel do?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
Gretel would come up with a plan.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.301
Hansel wasn't sure
how plans were made.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.304
But he was pretty sure
it involved brains and effort.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.227
-I think this is gonna take a while.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.189
Indeed.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.286
Gretel was ready to leave the village
and take her chances alone in the woods.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.665
But something held her back.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.126
Deborah. Jane. Theodelinda.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.129
Annabelle. Guinevere.
Hannah. Sarah. Aurora.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.757
I can't go. Not yet.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.093
If I go,
he's going to keep doing this.

08:31.844 --> 08:32.845
What would…

08:33.721 --> 08:37.099
What would Hansel do?
Hansel would stop him.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.018
-Somehow.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.104
-Well, hello, Gretel.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.608
It's probably just as well
you didn't go into the woods.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.027
There's so many dangerous things in there,

08:48.110 --> 08:50.530
and no one at all
to hear the sounds you'd make,

08:50.613 --> 08:53.407
the terrible, terrible sounds.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.744
I have to… cook the… laundry!

08:56.827 --> 08:59.372
-Made you flinch.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.083
In that moment,
Gretel decided to do

09:02.166 --> 09:04.168
-what her heart told her to do.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.923
I am gonna tell everyone in the village
all about this donkey clod,

09:09.006 --> 09:11.842
and they are gonna smack
the living snot out of him.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.305
Meanwhile,
Hansel had devised a plan of his own.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.078
-Oh, yes.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.080
-Oh… Oh…

09:41.163 --> 09:42.415
Oh, yeah.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.791
-Oh…

09:43.874 --> 09:48.129
Oh, it was full of fleas.
I wanted the one full of ticks.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.553
-A human!

09:55.636 --> 09:57.555
You let me out of here! Ah.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.557
-Let me out!

09:59.640 --> 10:02.393
-Oh, it's so cozy.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.274
If there was one thing
Hansel knew, it was this…

10:08.357 --> 10:11.319
Old people
never pass up a chance to nap.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.280
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.532
The fake eyelashes look like flies' legs.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.578
Oh, they are. Gross!

10:21.495 --> 10:25.041
Okay, I just have to make myself
look like that old devil lady.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.376
How hard could using makeup be?

10:31.797 --> 10:32.757
Perfect.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.681
Ah. Mmm!

10:42.350 --> 10:45.436
The smell of this stuff
really fills the whole house.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.564
It's like-- It's like
there's a human right next to me.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.029
Hmm.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.240
Hmm.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.742
Ah, Grandmother,

10:59.825 --> 11:03.412
yes, eh, where-- where on earth
have my glasses gotten to?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.497
Phew.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.459
The Devil… Ahem.
The Devil knows.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.670
But I don't.

11:10.753 --> 11:15.049
Oh, now, don't you worry
your diabolical, evil, little head.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.968
Let Granny massage your worries away.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.220
-Ooh!

11:19.303 --> 11:22.014
There, all nice and comfy.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.812
-Mmm.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.817
-Ah, what delicate fingers you have.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.070
Oh, sing me to sleep,
won't you, Grandmother?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.154
Sing?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.906
Yes, sing, yes.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.659
With your beautiful
fallen angel's voice, yes.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.953
Eh, you-- you can do that, can't you?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.336
-What a beautiful voice you…

11:52.420 --> 11:55.965
-…have, Grandmother.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.102
Mmm.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.981
Tar and pitch! Why did you do that?

12:12.064 --> 12:16.444
Oh, I'm sorry.
I fell asleep and I had a terrible dream.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.362
I must have grabbed your hair.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.116
-Oh. I love bad dreams.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.784
What was it?

12:23.868 --> 12:24.952
I…

12:25.035 --> 12:26.203
uh…

12:26.287 --> 12:27.246
I…

12:28.873 --> 12:32.084
I, uh, dreamed of a city
with a chocolate fountain.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.087
But it's not flowing
and all the people were sad.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.590
Ha! I know a city like that.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.676
I cursed it
by putting a frog under the fountain.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.095
It drinks up all the melted chocolate.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.515
If those fools just pulled it out,
their fountain would work again.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.227
You cause so much suffering.
Such a clever Devil.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.579
-Sulfur and brimstone!

13:08.662 --> 13:14.084
I… I had another bad dream,
and I must have grabbed your hair again.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.004
Well, what was it this time?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.966
I dreamed of a tree
that grew golden apples,

13:21.050 --> 13:24.053
but then it stopped bearing fruit
and all the people were sad.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.430
I remember a place like that.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.642
I put a mouse under the tree
to gnaw at its roots.

13:29.725 --> 13:33.562
If they get rid of that mouse, they'd have
all the golden apples they want.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.400
Look at you spreading misery everywhere.
Such a creative Devil.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.631
Phew.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.053
-Statistics!

14:06.136 --> 14:07.346
-I--
-I know.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.099
You had a bad dream.
Well, what was it this time?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.684
And if you pull my hair again,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.478
I will have your intestines
for a jump rope!

14:18.691 --> 14:22.611
Uh, I dreamed about a ferryman
who could never leave his boat.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.030
Ha! I cursed a guy like that.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.577
If only he knew.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.454
All he has to do is get someone
to take his pole from him,

14:32.538 --> 14:36.041
then he can leave and the other person
will remain there in his place forever.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.836
-I couldn't be prouder of you.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.796
Such a devilish Devil.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.927
-Hmm.
-Ugh.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.183
Hmm. Tsk.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.269
-Let me out!

14:55.352 --> 14:58.564
-Hey, you let me out of here right now!
-What the me is that?

14:58.647 --> 15:01.191
Oh, some demons
brought in a boy named Hansel,

15:01.275 --> 15:03.611
so I locked him up
until you were ready for him.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.447
Ah, Hansel, yes.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.741
I have big plans for that boy.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.910
It's rare that I get to torment

15:10.993 --> 15:13.037
-someone truly good.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.998
He's going to find out
what it's like when the Devil gets…

15:16.081 --> 15:17.750
…creative.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.418
Ooh!

15:19.501 --> 15:20.419
Oh!

15:20.502 --> 15:22.796
-Ow. Ow. Oh… Ooh!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.673
Where are my glasses?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.430
-Hey, you forgot to sign out!

15:33.599 --> 15:35.726
Meanwhile,
Gretel was setting out

15:35.809 --> 15:37.561
to tell everyone about the warlock.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.230
Please listen to me!

15:40.314 --> 15:42.107
The handsome young man is a warlock.

15:42.191 --> 15:45.402
He lures the young girls to his house
and he steals their souls!

15:47.613 --> 15:50.240
Don't you remember Marianne? Or Lilith?

15:50.824 --> 15:54.536
Unfortunately, the warlock
had already altered their memories.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.871
I don't believe it.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.249
Yeah. He's the hero
that saved our village from trolls.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.754
He made them believe
all sorts of outlandish things.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.756
He cured my wife's smallpox.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.050
He's a magical rabbit who grants wishes.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.427
He's the reason the sun rises.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.598
He's an evil warlock!

16:14.682 --> 16:17.559
What? I've been married to him
for six years!

16:17.643 --> 16:21.730
Oh my gosh. Me too.
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.941
She's just making up stories.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.277
Oh, she just doesn't understand him.
He's a great guy.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
-Boo!
-Who is this girl anyway?

16:29.113 --> 16:32.741
Dozens of girls are missing!
How can you not have noticed?

16:32.825 --> 16:36.161
-There must be some way I can prove it.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.623
The schoolhouse!
They must have some kind of records!

16:41.250 --> 16:44.420
-But it was no better there.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.132
Where's Marianne? Lilith?

16:48.215 --> 16:50.259
Susanna? Katherine?

16:50.342 --> 16:53.387
Those are all girls' names.
There are no girls in this school.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.889
Because they disappeared! Look!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.058
It's all boys!

16:58.142 --> 17:01.061
Only because there are no girls.
It's simple math.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.940
That's the class portrait, and every one
of the children in it is here.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.693
-He's erased them all!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.446
Oh, have I?

17:10.529 --> 17:14.074
-You, Gretel, you have been…

17:14.658 --> 17:15.743
naughty.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.788
How do I know you're my real grandmother?
Tell me something only you would know.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.248
You don't hate kittens.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.335
-Grandmother! It is you! Ah.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.465
Uh, don't spread that around, all right?
About the kittens?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.718
-That was a human child, disguised as me.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.637
It was Hansel! He tricked me!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.389
Well, that's not very nice.

17:37.473 --> 17:42.770
Gah! Shut up! Shut up and go get him
while I stir the people-part soup.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.397
Oh, I hate my life.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.275
-Poor little sausage.
-Uh…

17:48.358 --> 17:50.444
Oh!

17:55.407 --> 17:56.366
Aha!

18:06.877 --> 18:08.712
-Oh.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.006
-Agh! Statistics!

18:12.341 --> 18:13.801
Sausage!

18:13.884 --> 18:15.761
You'll want these.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.889
These what?
I-- I can't see without my glasses.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.641
Your glasses.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.892
Yes, my glasses!

18:21.975 --> 18:25.104
That-- That is what I can't see without.
Are you dense?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.273
Oh, just come here.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.610
-Now that Hansel

18:31.693 --> 18:35.572
had the three golden hairs,
the Devil's magic had no effect on him.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.784
He could see this place
for what it really was.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.287
-Oh, I hate myself for what I did!

18:42.371 --> 18:46.208
I don't understand.
No one is actually hurting them.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.336
-Then Hansel realized the truth.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.839
This isn't a place
where sinners are tortured.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.257
-This is a place

18:53.340 --> 18:55.759
where sinners torture themselves.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.724
I'm so sorry for what I did!

19:02.808 --> 19:05.686
I deserve this!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.899
-Hansel!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
You're mine!

19:16.029 --> 19:17.948
Hey! No running by the pool!

19:19.074 --> 19:20.659
What are you going to do to me?

19:20.742 --> 19:23.537
My dear Gretel, I would never hurt you.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.665
-But these people may feel differently.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.208
-You see…

19:28.292 --> 19:30.169
…they've just remembered that you are--

19:30.252 --> 19:31.712
-A witch!
-She's a thief!

19:31.795 --> 19:34.047
-Lock her up!
-That girl is evil!

19:34.131 --> 19:36.550
-She's a monster!
-She's a rogue elephant!

19:37.718 --> 19:39.845
A rogue elephant? Really?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.430
I got a little creative.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.639
-She's evil!
-Stop her!

19:42.723 --> 19:43.557
-Witch!
-Sorceress!

19:43.640 --> 19:45.767
-She mustn't go on!
-She'll put a spell on you!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.644
-She's a monster!
-Is that an elephant?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.522
They're gonna tear her apart!
We gotta do something!

19:50.606 --> 19:51.607
We cannot help her.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.942
Oh, because it's forbidden?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.737
No, because it's in the past.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.531
We're telling a story
about something that already happened.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.366
Do you not understand how time works?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.744
Can we at least throw her a rope?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.248
-Tie her up!
-She's evil!

20:11.793 --> 20:14.296
-Annabelle. Philippa. Susanna.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.549
Katherine. Felisha. Guinevere.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.259
-Aurora.
-Don't listen to her.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.553
She's a witch.
She's casting a spell on you!

20:21.637 --> 20:23.222
Edna. Sarah.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.432
-Jane. Amanda. Maura.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.478
-Look!
-Sabina. Sandra! Ingrid! Anne!

20:29.561 --> 20:31.855
Ava! Agneta! Brunhilda!

20:31.939 --> 20:34.900
-Amiria! Clarice! Constance!
-Agh!

20:37.194 --> 20:40.072
-Hannah!

20:40.155 --> 20:42.074
-Hannah?
-Hannah!

20:42.157 --> 20:44.660
-Oop, gotta go! Agh!

20:45.869 --> 20:47.746
-Get the oil!
-And the snakes!

20:47.829 --> 20:49.957
Did you know
the only way to kill a warlock

20:50.040 --> 20:51.959
is by boiling him in oil with snakes?

20:52.042 --> 20:54.544
It's also the only way
to make my favorite soup.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.547
-Snakes!

20:58.173 --> 21:00.175
-Get off of me!
-Boil! Boil!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.386
Listen to me, I don't--

21:02.469 --> 21:05.430
Enjoy your last meal.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.725
Take that!

21:13.480 --> 21:14.481
No!

21:14.564 --> 21:15.857
Uh, yes.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.404
Made you flinch.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.161
Once upon a time,
a young girl watched the end

21:28.245 --> 21:31.456
-of a young man she had thought she loved.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.377
-And she didn't feel very much at all.

22:31.975 --> 22:35.062
Look, they're back!
Charlotte! Denise! Susanna!

22:35.145 --> 22:36.188
-Audrey!

22:36.271 --> 22:38.148
-Catherine!
-They've returned!

22:38.231 --> 22:40.150
-Hannah!

23:01.296 --> 23:02.756
I'm sorry about…

23:02.839 --> 23:05.550
-Oh, everything.
-It's not your fault.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.303
Your memory was erased.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.013
Will you come home now?

23:10.097 --> 23:12.224
Tuna McSalmonstein misses you.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.644
My brother is still alive.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.978
And he's my home.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.272
I have to find him.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.274
Oh. All right.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.362
Well, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.280
I'll never forget you.

23:36.873 --> 23:40.043
Little did Gretel know
that Hansel was not far away,

23:40.127 --> 23:42.796
just down the same river
she was walking along…

23:42.879 --> 23:44.089
-…having…

23:45.215 --> 23:46.842
…rather a difficult time.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.847
-The Devil's chasing me

23:51.930 --> 23:53.098
with a flaming pitchfork!

24:03.608 --> 24:06.027
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

24:08.321 --> 24:10.157
-Come back here!
-Yes!

24:10.240 --> 24:11.116
Agh!

24:11.199 --> 24:13.660
-That guy, so bossy.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.330
Okay, here's our plan.

24:25.255 --> 24:29.092
-Let's get out of here.
-Wait. I want to see this.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.220
Hurry up!

24:32.304 --> 24:34.181
Why are you so slow?

24:34.848 --> 24:38.977
Oh, someday I'll get you in Hell
and I'll upholster a chair with you.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.443
Go!

24:46.526 --> 24:47.986
-So sorry.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.947
I've been doing this for ages.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.408
-I'm a bit slow.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.577
Here they come.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.245
Wait for it.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.500
Come on, come on, come on!

25:01.583 --> 25:04.586
Oh, my old bones.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.714
-So tired.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.924
Oh, give me that!

25:09.007 --> 25:11.718
-Agh!

25:16.389 --> 25:18.225
-So long, sucker!

25:18.308 --> 25:21.269
Welcome to your new life.

25:25.315 --> 25:28.401
Why… Why can't I… Oh.

25:28.485 --> 25:32.739
Right, my curse. I really should have put
a "doesn't work on the Devil" loophole.

25:32.822 --> 25:33.657
Hi!

25:34.491 --> 25:38.119
You!
This is your doing!

25:38.203 --> 25:41.498
-Well, I still have my pitchfork!

25:52.259 --> 25:54.052
-Run!

26:04.479 --> 26:05.313
Agh!

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
No!

26:09.901 --> 26:11.528
Hansel.

26:18.868 --> 26:19.995
Hansel!

26:21.955 --> 26:23.540
Gretel!

26:25.208 --> 26:26.167
Go.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.135
You're alive! You really are alive!

26:35.218 --> 26:36.261
Yeah.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.472
I was dead and then I was alive.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.890
And I was being a good boy,

26:40.974 --> 26:42.809
-but I went to Hell because--

26:42.892 --> 26:45.562
He's the one who was following me.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.939
Gretel, at last…

26:49.566 --> 26:51.401
It's okay. He's a friend.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.529
Listen, there's a doctor
back in the village.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.364
-We can--
-There's no time.

26:56.448 --> 27:00.952
I have to tell you a story,
a very important story.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.080
You see…

27:04.998 --> 27:07.042
I know why…

27:08.001 --> 27:10.712
your parents chopped off your heads.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.718
-Mind blown, man! Mind blown!
