00:00.946 --> 00:02.782
You are being watched.

00:03.923 --> 00:05.610
The government has
a secret system,

00:06.046 --> 00:07.210
a machine,

00:07.419 --> 00:09.666
that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.448 --> 00:11.550
I know because...

00:11.696 --> 00:12.620
I built it.

00:12.855 --> 00:15.305
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.307 --> 00:17.174
but it sees everything...

00:17.176 --> 00:19.960
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:19.962 --> 00:21.395
people like you,

00:21.397 --> 00:25.065
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.435
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.437 --> 00:30.287
But I needed a partner--

00:30.289 --> 00:32.990
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.992 --> 00:37.194
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.196 --> 00:39.146
You will never find us.

00:39.148 --> 00:41.148
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.150 --> 00:44.084
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:59.469 --> 01:01.168
- Any sign of the kid?
- No.

01:01.170 --> 01:02.586
Still looking.

01:02.588 --> 01:04.221
Knew we shouldn't have
trusted him.

Whenever you're ready,
Mr. Reese.

02:07.386 --> 02:10.588
I'm in here.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.725
Where did you come from?

02:14.727 --> 02:18.479
I breached the space-time
continuum.

02:18.481 --> 02:20.397
Not really.

02:20.399 --> 02:22.516
I did sense my privacy
being invaded.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.068
But we'll leave that for now.
We have work to do.

02:24.070 --> 02:25.152
Numbers have come in.

02:25.154 --> 02:26.770
What do you mean, numbers?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.772
What plurals usually mean.

02:28.774 --> 02:29.940
More than one.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.109
In this case four.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.395
Claire Ryan, 42,
lecturer at NYU.

02:35.397 --> 02:37.781
Matt Duggan, 33, a waiter.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.950
Wendy McNally, 29,
a hairstylist.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.036
And Paula Vasquez, 23,
unemployed.

02:42.038 --> 02:44.004
They seem completely random.

02:44.006 --> 02:45.372
Usually, when the machine

02:45.374 --> 02:47.691
sends us number clusters
like this,

02:47.693 --> 02:50.344
there is some connection.

02:50.346 --> 02:52.463
So one of these four
could be trying to kill

02:52.465 --> 02:54.798
the other three.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
Or they could all be victims
or all killers.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.135
Or as you say, all random.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.520
Either way,
we need to move fast.

02:59.522 --> 03:01.421
Claire Ryan's number
came up first

03:01.423 --> 03:02.690
if only by a millisecond.

03:02.692 --> 03:07.194
242 Wilson in Queens,
apartment 3C.

03:07.196 --> 03:12.733
Speaking of privacy.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.451
Careful what you look for,
Mr. Reese,

03:14.453 --> 03:17.571
or you might find it.

03:21.609 --> 03:24.044
We have to be straight
with you.

03:24.046 --> 03:25.296
Some things don't add up.

03:25.298 --> 03:27.965
Like what?

03:27.967 --> 03:29.950
You go to meet
your confidential informant,

03:29.952 --> 03:32.745
one Nashus Drake,
AKA "Bottlecap"--

03:32.847 --> 03:34.318
According to you
a trusted source.

03:34.507 --> 03:35.839
He shoots you in the chest.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.791
Luckily, you're wearing a vest.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.977
He's gonna kill you
when he gets shot

03:39.979 --> 03:41.294
by an unknown shooter?

03:41.296 --> 03:43.230
Like it says in my statement.

03:43.232 --> 03:45.132
Your statement doesn't say

03:45.134 --> 03:47.318
where this unknown shooter
came from.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.519
Because I don't know.

03:48.521 --> 03:50.971
It also doesn't say
why he did it.

03:50.973 --> 03:53.941
Maybe because he saw me
about to get shot.

03:53.943 --> 03:54.908
So he cares about you.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.077
I doubt he gives a damn
about me.

03:57.079 --> 03:59.113
But this is the man
you've been chasing

03:59.115 --> 04:00.414
for the last three months.

04:00.416 --> 04:03.751
As it says in my statement,
I believe so.

04:03.753 --> 04:06.120
So what, this guy allegedly
you've been trying to lock up,

04:06.122 --> 04:08.822
- he saves your life?
- "Allegedly."

04:08.824 --> 04:10.174
That's clever.

04:10.176 --> 04:12.042
You know what would be clever?

04:12.044 --> 04:13.493
You pretending to chase
this guy

04:13.495 --> 04:17.430
when in fact
you're working for him.

04:17.433 --> 04:18.966
I think we're done here.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.851
Detective, tell me something.

04:20.853 --> 04:23.503
Has he made contact with you?

04:23.505 --> 04:27.107
Spoken to you?

04:27.109 --> 04:29.193
You got my statement.

04:29.195 --> 04:33.680
We don't talk again
unless my delegate is present.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.516
[Chuckling]

04:36.518 --> 04:38.318
So he's pacing back and forth,
back and forth,

04:38.320 --> 04:39.703
back and forth.

04:39.705 --> 04:41.705
Finally pulls his mask down,
walks right into the door,

04:41.707 --> 04:43.040
knocks himself out cold.

04:43.042 --> 04:48.746
The genius forgot to cut
the eyeholes in the mask.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.798
Hey, Carter.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.132
What are you doing?
You got shot.

04:52.134 --> 04:53.417
Take some time off,
for Pete's sake.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.336
My vest got shot.
It can take some time off.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.089
How's it going with
the inquiry and everything?

04:59.091 --> 05:01.041
The way these things
usually go.

05:01.043 --> 05:03.177
They make you feel like you
murdered your own mother.

05:03.179 --> 05:06.213
So I'm stuck on my desk
and you're working with Olson.

05:06.215 --> 05:09.933
Oh, great.
Detective happy.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.151
What did you tell 'em
about the CI?

05:11.153 --> 05:12.186
The truth.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.854
He was taken out
by an unknown shooter.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.739
The guy-- You got a good look
at him this time, didn't you?

05:15.741 --> 05:18.075
No. Not his face.

05:18.077 --> 05:20.494
Well, maybe
that's a good thing.

05:20.496 --> 05:21.912
'Cause you know,
it would be hard.

05:21.914 --> 05:25.115
You don't know whether to thank
the guy or arrest him.

05:25.117 --> 05:30.003
No, that'd be easy.
I'd arrest him.

05:31.339 --> 05:32.873
Look, whatever happens
or you need anything,

05:32.875 --> 05:35.626
- I got your back, all right?
- Okay.

05:35.628 --> 05:38.128
Finch, I'm at Claire's
apartment.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.064
Something's up.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.730
Excuse me.

06:01.553 --> 06:03.403
Excuse me.

06:14.115 --> 06:16.166
- Finch.
- Mr. Reese.

06:16.168 --> 06:20.254
You said the machine would
give us the number and time.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.639
It didn't.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.484
[Radio chatter]

07:18.564 --> 07:20.314
So what do we got?

07:20.316 --> 07:22.099
Victim's name is Claire Ryan.

07:22.101 --> 07:25.186
Some kind of professor.
Lived alone.

07:30.359 --> 07:31.876
Looks like she was beaten up.

07:31.878 --> 07:34.579
One shot to the head,
close range.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.001
Looks like she came
into some money.

07:40.003 --> 07:42.503
BluRay player,
new tablet, shoes.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.156
Expensive shoes--
Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik.

07:46.158 --> 07:47.091
All bought this morning.

07:47.093 --> 07:50.461
What else do we know
about our vic?

07:50.463 --> 07:52.630
I asked you a question, Fusco.

07:52.632 --> 07:56.634
What?
What's that?

07:56.636 --> 07:58.052
I'm done at Claire's, Finch.

07:58.054 --> 07:59.353
I need you out on the street.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.856
You got to help me get eyes
on the remaining three.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.140
I'm more useful here,
trying to find connections

08:03.142 --> 08:04.225
between them.

08:04.227 --> 08:06.110
No point in that
if they're all dead.

08:06.112 --> 08:09.063
Tracking people down
is your area of expertise.

08:09.065 --> 08:11.315
I can't track
three people down,

08:11.317 --> 08:12.900
and I don't want
to lose anyone else.

08:12.902 --> 08:16.186
I need you out here.

08:16.188 --> 08:17.288
I'm on my way.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.356
I'll take Wendy.

08:19.358 --> 08:20.374
Put Fusco on Paula.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.026
Can you track Matt?

08:22.028 --> 08:24.128
I can track Matt.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.230
On my way.

08:26.232 --> 08:29.216
What the hell
are you doing here?

08:29.218 --> 08:30.701
You didn't kill her, did you?

08:30.703 --> 08:34.871
Lionel, after all
we've been through.

08:34.874 --> 08:36.090
Exactly.

08:36.092 --> 08:37.758
Why aren't you working
with Carter?

08:37.760 --> 08:41.211
She's on desk duty till
our homicide gets cleaned up.

08:41.212 --> 08:44.348
Some unknown gunman caused her
a world of grief.

08:44.350 --> 08:46.550
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

08:46.552 --> 08:48.152
No.
Find this girl Paula.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.655
Address is on the back.

08:50.657 --> 08:52.940
Keep your eyes on her.

08:52.942 --> 08:55.693
Paula Vasquez?
Why?

08:55.695 --> 08:57.912
Don't want her ending up
like the lady upstairs.

08:57.914 --> 09:00.230
You think she might?

09:00.232 --> 09:01.615
I know she won't,

09:01.617 --> 09:04.001
because you'll throw yourself
in front of the bullet.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.419
Funny guy.

09:05.421 --> 09:07.404
What about the homicide I'm
supposed to be investigating?

09:07.406 --> 09:10.257
Paula could be connected
to your homicide.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.543
Stay on her.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.522
Who messed with my desk?

09:24.524 --> 09:26.757

on your special forces guy?

09:35.601 --> 09:39.103

is in the file he's reading.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.039
You've been after this guy
for months.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.440
You don't even have
a description?

09:43.442 --> 09:45.876
He-- He's tall.
He wears a suit.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.828
Sometimes rides a motorcycle.
That's it.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.080
This is serious, Carter.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.248
You letting him run,
you've made him a problem

09:51.250 --> 09:52.282
for the whole department.

09:52.284 --> 09:54.552
I did not let him run.

09:54.554 --> 09:56.387
I've been trying to catch
the son of a bitch.

09:56.389 --> 09:59.807
Did he shoot your CI?

09:59.809 --> 10:02.810
I'm not answering that
until I know who he is.

10:02.812 --> 10:05.796
Answer the question
or turn in your badge.

10:11.302 --> 10:15.823
Yes, it was him.

Excuse me.

10:50.643 --> 10:52.476
Can I help you?

10:52.478 --> 10:55.512
I...

10:55.514 --> 10:57.347
Need to make an appointment.

10:57.349 --> 10:58.432
Wash and cut?

10:58.434 --> 11:00.284
Something a little more modern?

11:00.286 --> 11:01.485
Bit of styling?

11:01.487 --> 11:07.458
Is this, uh, gray, <i>au naturel</i>
or <i>au bouteille?</i>

11:07.460 --> 11:09.193
It's, uh--

11:09.195 --> 11:11.946
Sexy either way.

11:11.948 --> 11:14.465
- So, uh, you single?
- What?

11:14.467 --> 11:18.385
Single?
Yes.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.671
Girls, he's single.

11:20.673 --> 11:24.091
- Nice.
- Whoo!

11:24.093 --> 11:25.092
I just need an appointment.

11:25.094 --> 11:26.310
I'm sorry,

11:26.312 --> 11:27.928
but I'm not letting you
back out on the street

11:27.930 --> 11:30.581
looking like this.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.340
Damn it!

12:23.652 --> 12:25.786
Mr. Reese,

12:25.788 --> 12:27.404
I'm tracking our friend
Matt Duggan.

12:27.406 --> 12:30.274
Looks like he's having
an early midlife crisis.

12:30.276 --> 12:32.626
He just quit his job
and now he's shopping

12:32.628 --> 12:33.878
for motorcycles.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.113
Hold on.

12:36.115 --> 12:39.033
My aunt in Boston died,
left me a nice chunk

12:39.035 --> 12:40.384
of change.

12:40.386 --> 12:43.003
Thought I'd treat myself
to a dream.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.789
Won't be a minute, hon.

12:45.791 --> 12:48.893
Yep, he's buying himself
a new Ducati.

12:48.895 --> 12:50.678
Paying cash.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.930
Murdered woman Claire
was spending big too.

12:52.932 --> 12:55.232
Look around, Finch.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.800
Is anyone watching your guy?

12:56.802 --> 13:01.471
I'm not exactly good at this.

13:10.031 --> 13:13.667
No, no one I can see.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.287
Well, keep your eyes open.
[Phone beeps]

13:16.289 --> 13:18.756
Call me back.

13:18.758 --> 13:20.874
Lionel?

13:20.876 --> 13:23.544
Yeah, that Paula girl?
I lost her.

13:23.546 --> 13:24.878
She gave me the slip.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.630
Well, good work, Detective.

13:26.632 --> 13:28.332
I'm sorry, okay?

13:28.334 --> 13:31.518
Look, another thing.
I think she bought a firearm.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.639
You lost her
and she weaponed up?

13:35.641 --> 13:38.108
You better stick to your...

13:38.110 --> 13:39.176
Day job.

13:39.178 --> 13:41.195
[Phone beeps off] Excuse me.

13:41.197 --> 13:43.113
- I'm waiting for Wendy.
- I'm sorry.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.182
She had an emergency,
had to rush off.

13:45.184 --> 13:46.984
I'm free.
I can fit you in now.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.335
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

13:48.337 --> 13:49.686
Hi, um, Finch, what do got?

13:49.688 --> 13:53.123
Our man is coming
out of the showroom.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.243
Placed his order
and left a deposit.

13:56.245 --> 13:57.578
Okay, stay on him.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.529
Both girls just gave us
the slip.

13:59.531 --> 14:02.750
Hold on.
Someone left a stroller.

14:02.752 --> 14:04.802
- What are you talking about?
- There's a baby stroller

14:04.804 --> 14:07.371
near the car.
I don't know where the mom--

14:07.373 --> 14:10.808
Oh, there she is.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.426
Oh, my God, it's a bomb!

14:12.428 --> 14:14.812
Get down.
Get down on the ground, Finch.

14:14.814 --> 14:15.813
I have to warn him!

14:15.815 --> 14:16.880
[Electronic beeping]

14:16.882 --> 14:19.066
[Explosion]

14:21.486 --> 14:23.270
Finch, are you okay?

14:23.272 --> 14:25.105
Harold!

14:38.169 --> 14:40.237
[Phone beeps off]

14:46.608 --> 14:49.777
[Radio chatter]

14:53.532 --> 14:58.485
I saw it.
I saw the crash.

14:58.487 --> 15:01.238
Oh, my God.
He's dead.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.207
What's that stuff?

15:03.209 --> 15:06.160
Uh, I think it's cocaine.

15:06.162 --> 15:10.931
I should have seen it quicker.

15:10.933 --> 15:13.050
I mean, what kind
of a mother leaves a stroller?

15:13.052 --> 15:14.919
And she was wearing sunglasses
and a scarf,

15:14.921 --> 15:16.086
obviously to hide her face.

15:16.088 --> 15:17.254
- Finch.
- If I could have warned him,

15:17.256 --> 15:18.556
- he might still be here.
- Finch.

15:18.558 --> 15:20.123
You couldn't have saved him.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.042
You have to let it go.

15:22.044 --> 15:25.145
We have to concentrate
on the ones still alive.

15:25.147 --> 15:26.964
- Wendy and Paula.
- Yes.

15:26.966 --> 15:28.349
I've looked for connections,
found none.

15:28.351 --> 15:30.017
No shared employment history.

15:30.019 --> 15:31.652
No social networking.

15:31.654 --> 15:33.837
Paula's online footprint
is miniscule,

15:33.839 --> 15:35.506
so she's either
the paranoid sort

15:35.508 --> 15:37.140
or she likes to fly
beneath the radar--

15:37.142 --> 15:38.325
Both of which I can relate to.

15:38.327 --> 15:42.145
- But I--
- Finch, connections.

15:42.147 --> 15:43.480
Right, I'm sorry.

15:43.482 --> 15:45.749
Smartphones are constantly
searching for wi-fi signals.

15:45.751 --> 15:47.868
And they keep the last hundred
or so wi-fi hot spots

15:47.870 --> 15:48.953
in their memory.

15:48.955 --> 15:51.372
I've extracted that
from Matt, Wendy,

15:51.374 --> 15:53.140
and Claire's phones,
and I'm using it

15:53.142 --> 15:55.509
to plot where our friends went
in the last 24 hours

15:55.511 --> 15:57.160
to see if they--

15:57.162 --> 15:58.262
To see if they intersect.

15:58.264 --> 16:03.567
Roosevelt Drive...
11:57 PM.

16:03.569 --> 16:06.804
They were all in the same place
for four minutes.

16:06.806 --> 16:07.888
Why?

16:07.890 --> 16:09.506
According
to the d.O.T. Website,

16:09.508 --> 16:11.842
there was a traffic accident
with a fatality.

16:11.844 --> 16:14.445
Name of the deceased withheld.

16:14.447 --> 16:16.397
That's our connection.

16:16.399 --> 16:18.532
For three of them,

16:18.534 --> 16:20.234
but not paranoid Paula.

16:20.236 --> 16:22.119
We don't have her phone,
so we don't know

16:22.121 --> 16:24.071
where she was that night.

16:24.073 --> 16:26.206
Fusco said she bought a gun.
She could be our killer.

16:26.208 --> 16:27.625
Then you need to get to Wendy.

16:27.627 --> 16:29.627
I have tried,
but her apartment's empty,

16:29.629 --> 16:31.078
and she's abandoned
her cell phone.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.530
Only relative I could find--

16:33.532 --> 16:35.466
Wendy's mom Susan,
lives in Putnam County.

16:40.204 --> 16:42.306
[Sighs]

16:44.726 --> 16:47.761
- What are you doing, Carter?
- I got bored.

16:47.763 --> 16:49.763
Thought I'd lend you a hand
with your case.

16:49.765 --> 16:53.651
I ran your murder victim
Claire Ryan's fingerprints

16:53.653 --> 16:55.052
through AFIS.

16:55.054 --> 16:57.054
They showed up at this car crash
two nights ago.

16:57.056 --> 16:59.273
Claire's prints were
on the car.

16:59.275 --> 17:01.608
And this guy-- Matt Duggan.

17:01.610 --> 17:02.860
CSU thinks they were witnesses

17:02.862 --> 17:04.611
trying to help this guy
in the car,

17:04.613 --> 17:07.164
but he was killed on impact.

17:07.165 --> 17:08.999
I must have missed something.
How does this help our case?

17:09.001 --> 17:11.085
Well, Claire's dead,
and so is Matt.

17:11.087 --> 17:13.671
Killed in a car explosion
yesterday.

17:13.673 --> 17:15.455
Which could be a coincidence,

17:15.458 --> 17:18.125
except Matt had just bought
himself a brand-new Ducati,

17:18.127 --> 17:19.242
paying cash.

17:19.243 --> 17:20.794
Claire had been shopping too.

17:20.796 --> 17:22.980
So they're both at the crash,

17:22.982 --> 17:25.248
they both get money,
they both get dead.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.433
Money must have come
from inside the car.

17:26.435 --> 17:27.800
Who was driving it?

17:27.803 --> 17:30.771
According to CSU,
Congressman Hallen's son, Jamie.

17:30.773 --> 17:32.906
A congressman's son
gets killed?

17:32.908 --> 17:34.058
How does that get hushed up?

17:34.060 --> 17:35.225
Well, the congressman's
on the committee

17:35.227 --> 17:37.027
investigating
Wall Street banks.

17:37.029 --> 17:38.779
And he's a friend
of the police unions.

17:38.781 --> 17:41.699
I guess that buys
some goodwill.

17:41.701 --> 17:42.816
Was it an accident?

17:42.818 --> 17:45.152
CSU thinks Jamie
was speeding and on coke.

17:45.154 --> 17:46.537
The only thing
that was found in the car

17:46.539 --> 17:50.941
was a brochure for a haitian
orphans charity Jamie ran.

17:50.943 --> 17:54.277
I should go down to 1PP,
check out what the cameras

17:54.279 --> 17:56.213
at the real time
crime center saw.

17:56.215 --> 17:57.447
I think you should stay
at your desk

17:57.449 --> 18:02.886
like the captain told you to.

18:02.888 --> 18:04.621
[Door shuts]

18:10.795 --> 18:12.129
[Phone rings]

18:12.131 --> 18:14.631
[Phone beeps]
Lionel, what a pleasure.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.483
Our murder victim
Claire Ryan--

18:16.485 --> 18:18.936
She connects to
Congressman Hallen's son, Jamie.

18:18.938 --> 18:21.138
Died two nights ago
in a car crash.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.305
Maybe you want to give this
to your little friend

18:22.307 --> 18:23.407
with the glasses.

18:23.409 --> 18:25.526
I'm here, Detective Fusco.

18:25.528 --> 18:27.828
Yeah, right.
Hi to you too.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.530
Like I was about to say,

18:29.532 --> 18:31.698
there were two sets of prints
on Jamie Hallen's car.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.600
Claire's and a Matt Duggan's.

18:33.602 --> 18:36.420
- He got killed--
- In an explosion yesterday.

18:36.422 --> 18:39.039
Jamie Hallen crashed
on Roosevelt Drive?

18:39.041 --> 18:40.841
Thought that was supposed
to be hushed.

18:40.843 --> 18:42.342
Car crash must be where
they got the money, Finch.

18:42.344 --> 18:44.044
Jeez, anything you don't know?

18:44.046 --> 18:46.880
Yeah.
How's Carter doing?

18:46.882 --> 18:49.133
She's hanging in there,
you know?

18:49.135 --> 18:51.351
But it's hard to do the job
when you're stuck on your desk.

18:51.353 --> 18:54.238
We'll keep an eye on her,
make sure she's okay.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.023
And Detective,
leave your phone on

18:56.025 --> 18:58.692
when you talk
to Congressman Hallen.

18:58.694 --> 19:00.110
You can hear me all the time?

19:00.112 --> 19:02.512
Yes, and I'm hearing
rather too much

19:02.514 --> 19:03.513
of your lower intestine.

19:03.515 --> 19:04.565
Could you possibly
move your phone

19:04.567 --> 19:06.066
from your belt
to your jacket pocket?

19:06.068 --> 19:08.535
Hey, Fusco, you die in there?

19:08.537 --> 19:12.239
Keep your panties on,
I'm coming.

19:13.191 --> 19:14.892
If there's anything I can do,

19:14.894 --> 19:15.909
please call me.

19:15.911 --> 19:17.360
Thank you, Davis.

19:17.362 --> 19:18.361
Thank you very much.

19:18.363 --> 19:20.530
And again, deepest sympathies

19:20.532 --> 19:21.698
for your loss, Congressman.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.800
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

19:22.802 --> 19:25.752
The police, sir.

19:25.754 --> 19:27.004
Detectives Olson and Fiasco.

19:27.006 --> 19:30.007
Fusco.

19:30.009 --> 19:31.541
Why-- why are you here?

19:31.543 --> 19:32.893
I already talked
to one of your people

19:32.895 --> 19:34.678
about Jamie's accident.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.763
We have further questions
about the accident, sir.

19:36.765 --> 19:38.816
It may relate to another case.

19:38.818 --> 19:40.484
Do you know your son's movements
that night?

19:40.486 --> 19:42.936
He was at a party
at Davis Bannerman's house.

19:42.938 --> 19:46.890
He, uh, was driving home
when he was...Killed.

19:46.892 --> 19:49.443
You're investigating
Bannerman's bank,

19:49.445 --> 19:50.994
and your son socializes
with him?

19:50.996 --> 19:53.080
I didn't like it either,
but I couldn't control

19:53.082 --> 19:54.498
my son's social life.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.450
You son have a lot of money
on him that night?

19:56.452 --> 19:57.751
I have no idea.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.569
Why would that be pertinent?

19:59.571 --> 20:00.704
Two people were murdered.

20:00.706 --> 20:03.674
We think they were both
at the crash site.

20:03.676 --> 20:06.126
We also think
they found money in the car.

20:06.128 --> 20:08.912
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

20:08.914 --> 20:11.048
Was he dealing drugs?

20:11.050 --> 20:14.885
[Sighs]

20:14.887 --> 20:16.186
Look, he's dead.

20:16.188 --> 20:18.588
Can't we just let it go
at that?

20:18.590 --> 20:21.942
Two other people are dead too.
So, no.

20:21.944 --> 20:24.761
Was he dealing?

20:24.763 --> 20:26.480
I worried that he-- he--

20:26.482 --> 20:30.033
He was doing something
he shouldn't be doing.

20:30.035 --> 20:31.118
He was dealing with people

20:31.120 --> 20:33.871
he shouldn't have been
dealing with.

20:33.873 --> 20:35.873
That's all I can say about it.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.658
Well, we'll have to talk
to Bannerman.

20:37.660 --> 20:39.609
As long as you take
what he says to you

20:39.611 --> 20:40.727
with a grain of salt.

20:40.729 --> 20:44.831
We're not friends.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.616
One of these were found
in your son's car.

20:46.618 --> 20:48.385
Did he set up this charity?

20:48.387 --> 20:50.003
Yes, he did.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.588
That's how I like
to think of him.

20:51.590 --> 20:54.291
His good deeds.

20:54.293 --> 20:58.128
You left Bannerman's house,
but you weren't going home,

20:58.130 --> 21:00.981
were you, Jamie?

21:52.450 --> 21:53.850

Did you say anything to mom?

21:56.071 --> 21:57.621
Not till I know
that we're safe.

21:57.623 --> 21:59.189
Did you hear about
that guy Matt?

21:59.191 --> 22:02.692
There's people looking for us.

22:02.694 --> 22:04.044
Okay?

22:04.046 --> 22:07.965
You get back,
or I will shoot you.

How do you two know each other?

22:25.567 --> 22:26.883
We've known each other
for years.

22:26.885 --> 22:28.385
We're foster sisters.

22:28.387 --> 22:30.654
Not that that's any
of your business.

22:30.656 --> 22:33.857
Guess the, uh, money you took
from the crashed car

22:33.859 --> 22:37.110
is none of my business either?

22:37.112 --> 22:38.779
We're not telling you anything,

but the thing is--

is my phone just died

and the kids are getting
kind of scared,

23:10.646 --> 23:12.929

use your phone?

I persuaded a tech at
the real time crime center

24:05.663 --> 24:07.028
to copy this for me.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.698
Two cars stopped
after the crash.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.034
Crime center guys were able
to read the plates.

24:12.036 --> 24:14.636
Prius registered
to Claire Ryan,

24:14.638 --> 24:16.672
escort to Matt Duggan,

24:16.674 --> 24:18.507
so they're confirmed.

24:18.509 --> 24:20.392
But look at this.

24:20.394 --> 24:22.561
- Two more women.
- Mm-hmm.

24:22.563 --> 24:24.129
- Crime center identify them?
- Nope.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.732
Camera's set
for maximum field of view.

24:26.734 --> 24:30.218
Resolution's not enough
for facial recognition.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.888
This is where
it gets interesting.

24:32.890 --> 24:37.292
Suitcase.
That has to be the money.

24:38.695 --> 24:41.163
We got to find these girls
before the killers do.

24:41.165 --> 24:43.999
Guy at the crime center said
there's another detective

24:44.001 --> 24:45.000
looking for them.

24:45.002 --> 24:47.336
Detective Foster,
82nd precinct.

24:47.338 --> 24:48.370
We got anything else?

24:48.372 --> 24:50.455
Yeah.
This guy.

24:50.457 --> 24:52.925
About 30 minutes
after the crash,

24:52.927 --> 24:54.676
he makes a phone call.

24:54.678 --> 24:56.428
Wish we could hear
what he was saying.

24:56.430 --> 24:59.364
Unfortunately,
we're not the NSA.

24:59.366 --> 25:01.516
Vehicle must be new,
'cause look.

25:01.518 --> 25:02.684
There are no plates.

25:02.686 --> 25:04.586
That's convenient.

25:06.756 --> 25:10.058
Want to get
in some more trouble, Carter?

25:10.060 --> 25:11.393
Go talk to Detective Foster,

25:11.395 --> 25:13.111
and see if he knows anything.

25:13.113 --> 25:15.230
Be a pleasure.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.382
Finch,

25:33.384 --> 25:36.117
can you do a search
for Susan McNally

25:36.119 --> 25:37.302
at St. George's hospital?

25:37.304 --> 25:39.588
I'm on it.

25:39.590 --> 25:41.890
Everything all right?

25:41.892 --> 25:44.509
Killers just tried to take out
Wendy and Paula.

25:44.511 --> 25:45.894
Please tell me they failed.

25:45.896 --> 25:48.013
For now.
Girls took off.

25:48.015 --> 25:51.016
They're sisters, Finch.
Foster sisters.

25:51.018 --> 25:53.652
If their mom's still
at St. George's,

25:53.654 --> 25:54.903
that's where I think
they'll go.

25:54.905 --> 25:57.773
- Mom is still there.
- So she's sick?

25:57.775 --> 25:59.324
That why
the girls took the money?

25:59.326 --> 26:01.076
Had a fall, broke her hip.

26:01.078 --> 26:02.828
Not sick exactly.

26:02.830 --> 26:06.531
Her home is the problem.

26:06.533 --> 26:07.816
Mortgage is worth more
than the house.

26:07.818 --> 26:09.317
Bank's foreclosing on her.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.036
At least they took the money
for a reason.

26:11.038 --> 26:13.705
- You know whose it is yet?
- I'm digging.

26:13.707 --> 26:16.091
Keep those girls safe.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.596
Fusco, Carter.
Just left the 82nd.

26:21.598 --> 26:23.682
There is no Detective Foster.

26:23.684 --> 26:26.885
Somebody used a fake
detective shield to get eyes

26:26.887 --> 26:28.470
on the crash footage.

26:28.472 --> 26:31.356
[Car horns honking]

26:31.358 --> 26:33.608
Remember how Claire
was beaten up?

26:33.610 --> 26:37.112
I think the killer tracked her
through her license plates,

26:37.114 --> 26:38.346
then tortured her to get
the other names.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.232
Call me.

26:40.234 --> 26:42.684
What's wrong with you,
following a cop?

26:42.686 --> 26:44.119
Trying to get yourself shot?

26:44.121 --> 26:45.654
I'm just worried about you,
Detective.

26:45.656 --> 26:48.189
Don't.
Just back off, okay?

26:48.191 --> 26:51.710
You and your preppy friend
over there.

26:51.712 --> 26:54.830
Why don't we go somewhere
quiet where we can talk?

26:56.699 --> 26:58.366
You're CIA.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.636
I met plenty like you
in the green zone.

27:01.638 --> 27:04.089
So why are you worried
about me?

27:04.091 --> 27:05.841
Because of the man
you're chasing.

27:05.843 --> 27:07.509
He's dangerous.

27:07.511 --> 27:09.227
He saved my life.

27:09.229 --> 27:11.063
What was that, an accident?

27:11.065 --> 27:14.149
No. Just proves
he still has good instincts.

27:14.151 --> 27:16.384
- Do you even know him?
- Yeah.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.904
I was his best friend.

27:18.906 --> 27:20.889
Then why do you want him
so bad?

27:20.891 --> 27:23.108
Because he used to kill people
for his country.

27:23.110 --> 27:24.609
Now he just kills them.

27:24.611 --> 27:28.246
His victims...
The ones that we know of.

27:28.248 --> 27:29.898
For some he deserves a medal.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.867
For some, the chair.

27:31.869 --> 27:33.285
Why are you telling me this?

27:33.287 --> 27:35.087
'Cause we want you to know
who he is.

27:35.089 --> 27:38.340
He's an incredibly dangerous,
incredibly gifted man

27:38.342 --> 27:41.460
who's been almost destroyed
by the things he was made to do.

27:41.462 --> 27:43.795
He's always looking
for someone to trust,

27:43.797 --> 27:47.415
but his paranoia
makes trust impossible.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.885
I don't understand.

27:51.054 --> 27:53.588
Kara Stanton--
His CIA handler.

27:53.590 --> 27:54.723
They were a team.

27:54.725 --> 27:56.892
Inseparable,
saved each other's lives

27:56.894 --> 27:58.810
- a dozen times, and then--
- He killed her.

27:58.812 --> 28:00.612
Then disappeared.

28:00.614 --> 28:02.030
We thought he was dead.

28:02.032 --> 28:03.899
Gave him his star
on the wall at Langley.

28:03.901 --> 28:06.151
Then three months ago,
you ran his prints--

28:06.153 --> 28:07.869
Brought him back from the dead.

28:07.871 --> 28:10.372
We want to bring him back in
before he kills anyone else.

28:10.374 --> 28:12.407
Before he kills himself.

28:12.409 --> 28:14.993
We want to help him.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.581
So where do I come in
to all of this?

28:19.583 --> 28:22.300
We think he trusts you.

28:22.302 --> 28:26.221
Like he trusted her.

28:26.223 --> 28:29.458
We want you to keep yourself,
and him, alive.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.769
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Bannerman.

28:40.771 --> 28:44.689
Anything for the NYPD.

28:44.691 --> 28:46.191
Jamie Hallen--
He was at a party

28:46.193 --> 28:47.409
at your house, two nights ago.

28:47.411 --> 28:49.327
Briefly.

28:49.329 --> 28:50.779
He was stoned.

28:50.781 --> 28:51.780
I asked him to leave.

28:51.782 --> 28:53.331
Even ordered a cab for him.

28:53.333 --> 28:56.985
He left before it arrived...
Sadly.

28:56.987 --> 28:59.171
Was he dealing drugs?

28:59.173 --> 29:00.989
Look, I liked the kid.

29:00.991 --> 29:02.174
But I don't want to--

29:02.176 --> 29:03.425
Was he dealing drugs?

29:03.427 --> 29:07.012
I don't know.

29:07.014 --> 29:09.164
But he seemed to have
a lot of money suddenly.

29:09.166 --> 29:12.851
And, uh, let's put it
like this.

29:12.853 --> 29:16.771
I heard he was dealing
with some people he shouldn't.

29:20.393 --> 29:22.027
I heard, Detective Fusco.

29:22.029 --> 29:24.146
Bannerman's story confirmed
Congressman Hallen's.

29:24.148 --> 29:25.430
Yeah, he said the same things.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.232
- So it doesn't help us.
- You're not hearing me.

29:27.234 --> 29:29.951
He said the same thing
as Hallen.

29:29.953 --> 29:31.736
Look, I interrogate
a lot of douches,

29:31.738 --> 29:33.572
and I know when they got
their lies lined up.

29:33.574 --> 29:35.240
They coordinated their stories?

29:35.242 --> 29:37.042
Despite the fact they're
supposed to hate each other?

29:37.044 --> 29:40.045
I think Bannerman was working
something with Hallen.

29:40.047 --> 29:41.362
Jamie was a go-between,

29:41.364 --> 29:45.050
and now they're tossing him
under the bus.

29:53.509 --> 29:54.976
Mr. Reese?

29:54.978 --> 29:58.763
I'm at the hospital.

29:58.765 --> 29:59.931
Wendy's here.

29:59.933 --> 30:03.902
No sign of Paula.

30:03.904 --> 30:04.986
What do you got?

30:04.988 --> 30:06.238
Getting close.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.357
I know where Jamie was going
that night anyway.

30:09.359 --> 30:11.409
Only as far
as Laguardia airport.

30:11.411 --> 30:13.245
- Was he flying somewhere?
- Yes.

30:13.247 --> 30:15.914
On a jet
belonging to Davis Bannerman.

30:15.916 --> 30:19.084

filed with the FAA.

on the manifest.

Excuse me, can I help you?

30:23.957 --> 30:25.924
Are you looking for someone?

30:25.926 --> 30:28.843
Just found him.
Thanks.

30:28.845 --> 30:31.429
Why was he going
to the Caymans?

30:31.431 --> 30:35.250
I believe he was working
for his haitian orphans charity.

30:35.252 --> 30:38.353
A theory I'm about
to put to the test.

30:38.355 --> 30:40.522
I'll call you.

30:53.736 --> 30:55.904
Where's Paula?

30:55.906 --> 30:57.155
She's gone
to get something to eat.

30:57.157 --> 30:58.773
We were worried about you.

30:58.775 --> 31:01.109
Wasn't me
they were trying to kill.

31:02.912 --> 31:05.330
I'm sorry
we lied to you before.

31:05.332 --> 31:07.882
You were at the crash scene.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.119
Want to tell me what happened?

31:11.121 --> 31:13.305
We were out walking.

31:13.307 --> 31:17.458
The car crashed
almost in front of us.

there already...

a million bucks in it.

31:35.912 --> 31:40.248
I mean,
the money had to be illegal.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.317
So you took it.

31:42.319 --> 31:44.986
We divvied it up...

31:44.988 --> 31:47.989
250 grand each.

31:47.991 --> 31:50.425
Would have fixed everything.

31:50.427 --> 31:52.210
It was wrong.

31:52.212 --> 31:54.763
We knew it was wrong.

it's her knitting.

this is Thomas Paine.

33:29.652 --> 33:33.404
Congressman, thank you for
seeing me on such short notice.

33:33.406 --> 33:34.772
Always a pleasure to meet
a representative

are trying to bring you down.

And they're using your son
to do it.

How?

33:51.791 --> 33:53.407
Blackmail.

33:53.409 --> 33:56.427
You know about
his haitian orphans charity.

33:56.429 --> 33:58.796
Yes, I hope
it will be his legacy.

33:58.798 --> 34:00.932
I hope it won't.

34:00.934 --> 34:04.302
They have $30 million
in that account,

34:04.304 --> 34:07.105
and they've never helped
a single child.

34:07.107 --> 34:09.607
It's a classic
black-arts setup.

34:09.609 --> 34:11.592
They open an offshore
account--

34:13.112 --> 34:14.762
The banks, of course.

34:14.764 --> 34:15.763
Bannerman and his ilk.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.697
They stuff it with money,

34:17.699 --> 34:19.433
they tie you to it
by association,

34:19.435 --> 34:21.985
and then they expose it
and ruin you.

34:21.987 --> 34:24.739
The man who's supposed to bring
honesty to Wall Street

34:24.741 --> 34:27.492
is shown to be as corrupt
as those he's investigating.

34:27.494 --> 34:30.460
Have you taken this
to the police?

34:30.463 --> 34:31.579
No, no, no.

34:31.581 --> 34:34.614
They're in the pocket
of Wall Street.

34:34.617 --> 34:38.002
I'm offering you a chance
to extricate yourself.

34:38.004 --> 34:41.255
As your son's executor,
you could close that charity,

34:41.257 --> 34:44.257
transfer those funds
to the Red Cross.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.226
And then what
would your enemies have on you?

34:46.228 --> 34:47.395
Nothing.

34:47.397 --> 34:49.230
You'd be clean.

34:49.232 --> 34:52.350
And all of their dirty money
would have gone to a good cause.

34:52.351 --> 34:56.303
