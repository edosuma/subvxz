WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:03.485
Previously on "Casual"...

00:04.607 --> 00:06.024
I want it off my body.

00:06.113 --> 00:09.053
You pay for half,
and I will pay for half.

00:09.078 --> 00:11.701
You get a summer job.
Might be good for you.

00:11.726 --> 00:13.309
You might actually learn something.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.603
Compensation-wise,
what are we looking at?

00:15.604 --> 00:17.272
It's, uh, 65 a signature.

00:17.273 --> 00:19.065
- Dollars?
- Cents.

00:19.066 --> 00:21.776
These are ballot props,
not credit card applications.

00:21.777 --> 00:23.361
You're currently not working?

00:23.362 --> 00:26.197
I mean, I'm dabbling
in the hospitality business.

00:26.198 --> 00:29.617
In the past 12 months,
your expenses are nearly double.

00:29.618 --> 00:31.202
If I put you on a budget,

00:31.203 --> 00:35.498
your savings can get you through
the end of the year, maybe.

00:35.499 --> 00:37.000
Oh, Leon, you're a lifesaver.

00:37.001 --> 00:39.294
The movers are gonna be here
between 10:00 and 12:00,

00:39.295 --> 00:40.754
but who knows.

00:40.755 --> 00:43.673
They also said I'd have a table
two weeks ago.

00:43.674 --> 00:45.884
It's, uh, quite a tale.

00:45.885 --> 00:49.095
- Why is Leon on your floor?
- Because he made dinner.

00:49.096 --> 00:50.805
Cloth napkins and a checkered blanket?

00:50.806 --> 00:52.098
He made you an indoor picnic.

00:52.099 --> 00:53.433
We were supposed to get ribs later.

00:53.434 --> 00:54.976
I just wanted to come home,

00:54.977 --> 00:58.521
sit at a table, open up my journal.

00:58.522 --> 00:59.856
And I just wanted to map out

00:59.857 --> 01:01.941
how I was gonna make my life
feel different.

01:01.942 --> 01:05.165
I just want things to feel different.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.545
So... what do you think?

01:14.413 --> 01:15.914
It's a table.

01:15.915 --> 01:17.704
That's it? It's just a table?

01:17.729 --> 01:22.564
Uh, sturdy legs, flat surface.

01:22.589 --> 01:24.756
Yeah, I'm getting a definite table vibe.

01:24.757 --> 01:26.591
I birthed you out of my own body.

01:26.592 --> 01:28.176
So I've heard.

01:28.177 --> 01:30.678
I'm surprised you didn't go
mid-century modern.

01:30.679 --> 01:32.764
What is that? An old age joke?

01:32.765 --> 01:34.390
Only if you make it one.

01:34.391 --> 01:36.392
Oh, fine.

01:36.393 --> 01:39.437
You are giving me lots of fuel,

01:39.438 --> 01:42.440
pages and pages of it.

01:42.441 --> 01:44.817
Aw, someone's nervous for her first day.

01:44.818 --> 01:46.152
Well, I'm cautiously optimistic.

01:46.153 --> 01:49.948
What does one do in
a storytelling class, anyway?

01:49.949 --> 01:51.950
We mine the experiences of our lives

01:51.951 --> 01:56.162
to create a truthful
and engaging performance piece.

01:56.163 --> 01:58.623
Sounds hokey.

01:58.624 --> 01:59.916
Don't you have work?

02:03.629 --> 02:05.547
- Love you.
- Love you back.

02:11.988 --> 02:13.249
No, no!

02:13.274 --> 02:14.949
Gonna get you.

02:14.974 --> 02:17.225
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Here comes the tiger.

02:17.226 --> 02:19.272
Rawr, rawr.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.988 --> 02:35.369
- Man, those moves were good.
- Hey, there.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.036
Oh, good morning.

02:37.037 --> 02:38.366
Getting an early start, I see.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.599
Yeah, well, you know what they say.

02:39.624 --> 02:41.904
The early bird gets the worm,
doesn't he?

02:41.929 --> 02:45.020
Never realized how grossly
sexual that saying could be.

02:45.045 --> 02:46.838
Oh, hey, uh,
we wanted to ask your advice.

02:46.839 --> 02:48.668
Should we do the Walk of Fame
or the La Brea Tar Pits first?

02:48.693 --> 02:50.675
Well, I really... I wanted
to see the Hollywood sign.

02:50.676 --> 02:53.177
Oh, yeah, that's fun.
Just check to see that it's up.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.221
They take it down twice a week
to clean the letters.

02:55.222 --> 02:56.264
- Really?
- Oh, I didn't realize that.

02:56.265 --> 02:57.581
- Mm-hmm.
- That seems like a lot.

02:57.606 --> 02:59.927
Oh, I don't know, Ken.
I mean, it is a cultural icon.

02:59.952 --> 03:01.346
Yeah, we're very proud of it.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.350
Oh, sorry.

03:04.481 --> 03:07.894
I'm a terrible host.
Can I pop a couple in for you guys?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.387
No.

03:11.864 --> 03:13.156
We bought those bagels.

03:13.157 --> 03:14.157
Oh, but please, help yourself.

03:14.158 --> 03:16.007
- Oh.
- Uh, there is enough

03:16.032 --> 03:17.447
- for everyone.
- I'm sorry.

03:17.472 --> 03:19.454
Yeah. Just maybe next time,
you could just ask.

03:19.455 --> 03:22.236
Yeah, of course.
Um, just give me one second,

03:22.261 --> 03:24.209
and I will be out of your way.

03:26.587 --> 03:28.022
It's your tomato, isn't it?

03:28.047 --> 03:30.757
- Yeah, it is.
- Fuck.

03:38.829 --> 03:41.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:47.023 --> 03:48.950
Do you like this outfit?

03:49.903 --> 03:54.474
Do you want me to lie,
or be your friend?

03:54.531 --> 03:57.400
Well, since when are the two
mutually exclusive?

03:57.756 --> 04:00.120
You look like a kindergarten teacher.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.109
Fuck.

04:02.164 --> 04:03.247
But that could be a good thing.

04:03.353 --> 04:04.933
Kindergarten teachers are the source

04:05.000 --> 04:07.540
of some of our earliest happy memories.

04:07.573 --> 04:09.247
- Mine was a pedophile.
- What?

04:09.313 --> 04:11.260
Uh-huh, got off on a mistrial,

04:11.382 --> 04:12.798
went to the Arizona-Mexico border,

04:12.878 --> 04:15.051
became a vigilante immigrations officer.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.571
He's murdered people... multiple people.

04:17.683 --> 04:19.538
I heard he got a medal.

04:21.630 --> 04:24.397
- Do you wanna go shopping?
- Yeah.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.926
Hello, hurried consumer,

04:30.067 --> 04:31.609
care to sign the Green Power Initiative

04:31.634 --> 04:33.481
and put alternative fuel
vehicles on the road?

04:33.506 --> 04:34.854
No, you do not.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.894
Good sir, care to tune out the world

04:37.992 --> 04:41.935
as you float through life
unmoored, alone.

04:42.052 --> 04:43.219
Pretty eloquent.

04:43.247 --> 04:45.461
Oh, I save my best for the unaware.

04:45.501 --> 04:48.135
- Do you want this petition to die?
- It's California.

04:48.168 --> 04:50.336
Pretty sure there's
a thousand more on deck.

04:50.337 --> 04:52.503
Well, they all deserve our time.

04:52.550 --> 04:54.507
Okay, so you'd be happy
getting signatures

04:54.508 --> 04:55.670
for the gun lobby?

04:55.730 --> 04:58.019
Or the human Q-tip who wants to
end Planned Parenthood?

04:58.059 --> 04:59.893
No, the free exchange of ideas

04:59.946 --> 05:02.473
supersedes my own legislative opinion.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.709
I mean, we're the mouthpiece
of the people,

05:04.755 --> 05:06.978
the primary pillar of democracy.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.479
Oh, sure, mock me,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.649
but it's your future that looks bleak.

05:11.650 --> 05:14.078
Hey, good afternoon, guys, I'm Tracy.
How are you?

05:14.103 --> 05:15.820
I'm working with the clean renewable...

05:15.821 --> 05:18.740
I just wondered
if you had a minute to...

05:24.355 --> 05:26.748
- What are you doing here?
- Going bowling.

05:26.773 --> 05:28.282
Right. Sign this?

05:28.307 --> 05:30.375
Absolutely not.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.372
Okay, so this is the cereal aisle,
and it's just like Postmates,

05:33.412 --> 05:34.805
except if you want a box,
you just grab one.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.858
- Hush, I'm multitasking.
- Job search?

05:36.883 --> 05:39.315
- Tell me!
- It's all dumb.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.054
Just dressed up entry-level stuff.

05:41.055 --> 05:42.235
Where are you getting those lists?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.949
- Headhunter.
- That sounds violent.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.009
That's what work is,

05:45.049 --> 05:47.769
a sublimation of our violent
desires to hunt and fuck.

05:47.770 --> 05:50.500
- $14 for almond butter?
- Organic's $19.99.

05:50.547 --> 05:52.560
How are people supposed to
pay for this shit?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.900
You could get rid of
your Wine of the Month club.

05:54.953 --> 05:57.497
I know, it's a real "Sophie's Choice."

05:57.577 --> 06:00.137
You joke, but I already did,
with all my clubs.

06:00.199 --> 06:01.830
Now you'll never make the yearbook.

06:01.877 --> 06:04.595
This is insane.
Do I even need almond butter?

06:04.620 --> 06:06.547
Plenty of other butters
out there: sesame butter,

06:06.621 --> 06:07.987
macadamia butter,

06:08.334 --> 06:09.541
shit, even peanut butter.

06:09.566 --> 06:10.947
Maybe I'm a peanut butter guy.

06:10.981 --> 06:12.234
Could I be a peanut butter guy?

06:12.259 --> 06:14.332
Jiff... that's a peanut butter.

06:14.419 --> 06:16.519
Why aren't you paying attention to me?

06:22.596 --> 06:24.489
Oh.

06:24.723 --> 06:26.589
- Yes!
- No.

06:26.774 --> 06:28.232
I just...

06:28.269 --> 06:30.563
- What?
- They feel like sausage casing.

06:30.629 --> 06:32.658
I mean... which makes
looking for a mirror

06:32.724 --> 06:34.331
that much more enjoyable.

06:34.441 --> 06:35.942
So good.

06:35.943 --> 06:38.111
- Hm.
- Yes.

06:38.112 --> 06:39.737
Do you have these in an 8? Thank you.

06:39.738 --> 06:41.739
What am I doing here?
I mean, this... it's Laura.

06:41.740 --> 06:42.905
It's not me.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.659
You know how there's body dysmorphia,

06:44.660 --> 06:46.179
and people think they're way bigger

06:46.205 --> 06:47.679
or smaller than they are?

06:47.704 --> 06:49.747
Uh, yes, I am familiar
with that syndrome.

06:49.748 --> 06:51.932
Well, it's like you have
personality dysmorphia,

06:51.957 --> 06:54.290
and you think you're
way less cool than you are.

06:54.390 --> 06:56.337
Thank you. That is really nice, I think.

06:56.338 --> 06:57.755
And you only dress
one part of yourself...

06:57.780 --> 07:00.935
this, like, mom slash therapist

07:00.960 --> 07:03.070
slash responsible person part.

07:03.095 --> 07:05.334
Well, what's the other part?

07:05.390 --> 07:07.587
Pure fun.

07:07.847 --> 07:09.642
- Hmm.
- No.

07:09.643 --> 07:10.477
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

07:10.478 --> 07:11.644
- Sit down.
- I... ugh.

07:11.645 --> 07:13.771
- Stop it.
- Okay, you know what?

07:13.772 --> 07:15.481
There are...

07:16.554 --> 07:18.080
There are two kinds of people
in the world.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.443
- Did you know that?
- Nope.

07:19.444 --> 07:21.112
There are cool boot people,

07:21.113 --> 07:23.614
and then there are not cool boot people.

07:23.615 --> 07:24.449
I...

07:24.929 --> 07:26.846
Fit firmly in the latter camp.

07:34.728 --> 07:36.231
No.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.614
You're getting those boots.

07:47.431 --> 07:48.973
You follow Emmy on Instagram?

07:48.974 --> 07:50.423
I follow everyone on Instagram.

07:50.448 --> 07:52.576
- Also, it's rude to unfollow.
- Oh.

07:52.601 --> 07:54.289
When's the last time you saw her?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.963
Uh, seven months ago.

07:58.794 --> 08:00.104
I should go.

08:03.155 --> 08:04.439
Hey, listen, thank you so much

08:04.479 --> 08:05.907
for taking the time
to sign with us today.

08:05.908 --> 08:08.293
I really appreciate it, sir.
Have a great afternoon.

08:24.108 --> 08:28.300
So if they clone you, does that
mean your spit has the same DNA?

08:28.367 --> 08:30.222
Yeah, everything's the same.

08:30.262 --> 08:32.102
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, everything's the same.

08:32.126 --> 08:33.284
- Everything?
- Every...

08:36.015 --> 08:38.150
So I'm just gonna wear this out of here.

08:38.174 --> 08:39.065
Yeah.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.835
Is that a patient?

08:41.860 --> 08:44.446
If it is, I can finish up here
and just meet you back at the office.

08:44.471 --> 08:46.722
Nope, it's just Leon again.

08:47.132 --> 08:49.284
I don't wanna give him
the wrong impression.

08:49.351 --> 08:53.917
- So what's the right impression?
- Well, I like him, just not...

08:54.084 --> 08:55.793
I just don't like him that way.

08:55.871 --> 08:58.784
He did this picnic
the other night, and, uh,

08:58.924 --> 09:01.457
as soon as I saw it, I got nauseous.

09:01.504 --> 09:05.077
Well, with everything that's going on,
are you sure that's about Leon?

09:05.102 --> 09:07.176
Well, it wasn't the food.

09:07.177 --> 09:10.620
Yeah, but I'm saying nausea
is, like, an extreme reaction

09:10.707 --> 09:12.800
to someone who is attractive

09:12.873 --> 09:17.561
and thoughtful and appreciates poetry.

09:17.562 --> 09:19.697
- Leon likes poetry?
- Did he leave a voicemail?

09:19.763 --> 09:21.210
Yeah.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.989
<i>Valerie, hello, it's, uh, Leon.</i>

09:24.014 --> 09:25.411
I fucking love that accent.

09:25.436 --> 09:26.491
I mean, how can you even hear it?

09:26.516 --> 09:28.076
<i>I have tickets for "Rear Window" tonight</i>

09:28.101 --> 09:29.689
- <i>at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.</i>
- Oh, my God,

09:29.714 --> 09:31.756
I have tickets to that.
You should totally go.

09:31.883 --> 09:35.064
What is wrong with me?
I mean, I... I should like him.

09:35.089 --> 09:37.206
It's... it's Leon. He's great.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.291
- Yes.
- And he has very soft hands,

09:39.316 --> 09:40.593
like way softer than mine.

09:40.618 --> 09:41.930
- It's weird.
- Oh.

09:41.955 --> 09:43.897
I should be so lucky.

09:43.922 --> 09:46.007
And the movie
doesn't even start till 9:00.

09:46.008 --> 09:47.807
I really think you'll like this.

09:47.832 --> 09:49.427
Yeah, okay.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.767
Um... "That sounds fun.

09:54.792 --> 09:59.671
I have a class, but I will see you...

09:59.696 --> 10:00.907
- Yeah!
- ...after."

10:00.932 --> 10:03.691
Okay, so it's all about the low chairs,
so bring a low chair...

10:03.692 --> 10:05.691
- And cheese and wine and snacks.
- Mm-hm.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.280
It's another picnic.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.360
So why are you here?

10:12.213 --> 10:14.507
Uh, green energy.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.267
Hm.

10:16.873 --> 10:18.353
Nah, but really.

10:26.419 --> 10:27.946
What are you, like,

10:27.986 --> 10:29.633
in a Beverly Hills white girl gang?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.773
Sign for me?

10:32.259 --> 10:34.691
- Help me get it off?
- Can't do it.

10:34.803 --> 10:36.346
Not allowed.

10:39.858 --> 10:41.318
Fuck.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.979
- Is it weird?
- What?

10:46.004 --> 10:48.517
Having a President who,
if he had his way,

10:48.542 --> 10:50.571
would round you all up and send you back

10:50.572 --> 10:53.988
to some country you probably
don't even remember?

10:54.334 --> 10:56.488
Well, I'm from Boyle Heights.

10:56.513 --> 10:57.921
Echo Park.

10:57.946 --> 10:59.697
Commerce.

11:00.613 --> 11:04.210
You fucker. You totally set me up!

11:05.344 --> 11:07.014
Wait, okay, why can't you sign then?

11:07.039 --> 11:09.612
- We already signed Skinny Ponytail's.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:09.637 --> 11:12.427
And we can't go twice.
That's just illegal.

11:13.098 --> 11:15.127
- Awkward.
- Yeah.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.934
- Alex, first let me...
- No, it's fine, I forgive you.

11:17.959 --> 11:20.085
You forgive me?

11:20.302 --> 11:21.928
Amy's pregnant.

11:22.789 --> 11:24.730
What if it's mine? Or yours?

11:24.731 --> 11:26.763
- It's not mine.
- No? You guys didn't?

11:26.788 --> 11:28.664
Even during the four-way?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.170
No, no.

11:30.195 --> 11:31.783
Well, I did, many times.

11:31.808 --> 11:34.257
- Good for you.
- And yeah,

11:35.396 --> 11:37.659
we used protection, but, I don't know,

11:37.684 --> 11:39.654
pills fail, condoms break. Fuck.

11:39.679 --> 11:41.617
That sounds a little farfetched.

11:41.642 --> 11:44.166
How do you... how do you know
how far along someone is?

11:44.167 --> 11:46.337
Like, what's the barometer?

11:46.537 --> 11:47.842
Use the ball scale.

11:47.867 --> 11:51.872
Is it a cricket ball or a basketball?

11:51.925 --> 11:54.552
It's... it's more like
a volleyball, slightly deflated.

11:54.553 --> 11:57.662
So a large honeydew?

11:57.695 --> 12:00.015
Honeydew's not a ball, Leon.

12:00.049 --> 12:01.392
And she's very breasty.

12:02.032 --> 12:03.991
Don't you think that if it were yours,

12:04.086 --> 12:07.329
she would've told you?
She always was very honest.

12:10.989 --> 12:13.032
That is true.

12:13.311 --> 12:15.992
Perhaps you should just assume the best

12:16.017 --> 12:18.561
and let it go.

12:22.711 --> 12:24.128
Okay.

12:26.987 --> 12:31.660
_

12:31.720 --> 12:34.091
"Howdy, stranger"? Fuck it.

12:38.409 --> 12:42.824
_

12:42.885 --> 12:45.191
Fuck.

12:48.773 --> 12:50.912
- How was the Hollywood sign?
- Oh, it was awesome.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.839
Put it back up for ya?

12:53.879 --> 12:55.912
Ah, fuck, Ken, I did it again.

12:55.947 --> 12:58.164
- It's... it's totally fine.
- No, Ken, I'm sorry.

12:58.189 --> 12:59.867
I went to the store
so this wouldn't happen,

12:59.868 --> 13:01.616
and then I saw
a picture of my ex-girlfriend,

13:01.641 --> 13:02.953
- and she's pregnant.
- Oh.

13:02.954 --> 13:06.479
Yep, can you believe it?
Full-on honeydew.

13:06.576 --> 13:08.577
And what do you text a pregnant ex?

13:08.653 --> 13:10.628
- You don't.
- You think?

13:10.629 --> 13:13.086
Uh, no good can come of it. Trust me.

13:13.178 --> 13:14.560
Yeah.

13:15.050 --> 13:18.124
What do you mean no good can come of it?

13:18.244 --> 13:19.986
Yeah, no good can come of it.

13:20.024 --> 13:22.104
- That's right.
- You just...

13:22.164 --> 13:24.975
you seem awfully knowledgeable
about this subject, Ken.

13:24.976 --> 13:27.061
- Oh, no.
- Guys, excuse me, I...

13:27.062 --> 13:29.130
- Oh, no, no, you don't have to leave.
- No, I'm gonna...

13:29.162 --> 13:31.117
- Okay, that's it, right?
- That's it, yeah.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.588
- It's just a friend.
- Okay, what kind of a friend?

13:33.589 --> 13:35.321
- It was Steve. He had...
- Steve was pregnant?

13:35.346 --> 13:37.101
Can we... this is where
I just stop talking,

13:37.126 --> 13:39.181
- 'cause you just keep talking.
- Oh... oh, okay, well, you know,

13:39.206 --> 13:41.403
here I thought vacation was
kind of a different thing now,

13:41.428 --> 13:43.637
but it's just like
you're bringing everything here.

13:43.662 --> 13:46.422
Telling your own story

13:46.464 --> 13:49.149
on your own terms sounds easy,

13:49.876 --> 13:54.366
but I can't tell you
how many people get up on stage

13:55.820 --> 13:58.466
and immediately lose their audience.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.016
Where'd they go?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.192
How you present yourself

14:03.245 --> 14:07.759
informs your listeners'
impression of your story.

14:07.785 --> 14:09.492
It colors every experience,

14:09.561 --> 14:11.419
every inkling they may have

14:11.466 --> 14:15.326
before you even say a word.

14:15.443 --> 14:17.293
Presence, confidence,

14:17.380 --> 14:19.273
even posture, guys.

14:19.313 --> 14:23.416
These are integral components
to good storytelling.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.889
We're gonna start with an exercise.

14:25.944 --> 14:27.650
Uh-oh.

14:28.456 --> 14:30.853
Some of you...

14:31.792 --> 14:33.866
will be slightly uncomfortable.

14:33.938 --> 14:35.720
You're each gonna stand up on stage

14:35.780 --> 14:40.120
and listen to
our first impressions of you.

14:40.265 --> 14:41.974
Okay, so...

14:42.035 --> 14:42.869
Motherfucker.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.707
To the firing squad.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.771
Who would like to go first?

14:51.063 --> 14:52.136
I read a study that said

14:52.161 --> 14:53.529
when people are getting in their cars,

14:53.554 --> 14:55.883
and no one's waiting,
its takes them nine seconds

14:55.908 --> 14:57.901
- to leave the parking spot.
- Hm.

14:57.902 --> 14:59.981
You know how long it takes
when people are waiting?

15:00.255 --> 15:01.841
16 seconds.

15:01.948 --> 15:03.812
I will take us back to
the office when I'm ready.

15:03.872 --> 15:05.080
You're enjoying this.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.898
I am simply being thorough
after a hard day of work.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.220
So how many did you get?

15:15.971 --> 15:17.289
Guess.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.843
- Fewer than 20.
- Winner, winner.

15:19.868 --> 15:21.592
Well, I know a place where you can get

15:21.593 --> 15:23.612
a bunch of signatures, if you're game.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.640
It's in the back of your rape van?

15:25.665 --> 15:28.727
Mm-hmm, I got 40 illegals
here with pens,

15:28.752 --> 15:30.767
and they love ballot props.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.335
Aw, I bet you say that to all the girls.

15:55.312 --> 15:59.077
_

16:00.961 --> 16:03.978
_

16:05.455 --> 16:07.341
_

16:07.366 --> 16:09.461
__

16:09.485 --> 16:14.466
_

16:14.510 --> 16:16.866
__

16:29.387 --> 16:33.047
_

16:34.756 --> 16:35.820
_

16:40.258 --> 16:42.631
_

16:42.968 --> 16:47.238
_

16:50.703 --> 16:54.503
_

16:55.698 --> 16:58.241
He seems confident.

16:58.276 --> 16:59.814
Yeah, a-athletic.

16:59.869 --> 17:01.543
Like he cares about his body...

17:01.568 --> 17:03.094
- Mm.
- And maybe the Earth,

17:03.119 --> 17:05.182
or maybe not.

17:05.207 --> 17:07.527
- Mm-hm.
- He's kinda tall.

17:07.632 --> 17:10.352
He seems clean,

17:10.768 --> 17:12.518
like he likes a good shower.

17:12.559 --> 17:15.492
I do like a good shower. Yeah.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.909
Anyone else?

17:18.643 --> 17:20.385
Okay, thanks, Byron.

17:20.410 --> 17:22.329
Thank you.

17:22.355 --> 17:25.066
Valerie, are you ready?

17:36.844 --> 17:38.804
What do we see?

17:41.282 --> 17:43.408
She looks like a nice lady.

17:43.433 --> 17:46.820
Like someone you'd ask
for directions from.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.823
- Yeah.
- She has warm eyes.

17:48.848 --> 17:51.074
- Hm.
- That's great.

17:51.075 --> 17:53.369
I wanna dig a little deeper.

17:53.394 --> 17:55.909
I want you to get beneath those layers,

17:55.934 --> 17:58.494
and really give her something...

18:00.081 --> 18:02.227
to examine.

18:03.539 --> 18:06.929
Uh, she looks like a mom?

18:07.067 --> 18:09.182
Who's trying not to look like a mom?

18:09.233 --> 18:13.294
- Mm, I see that.
- No ring, so probably divorced.

18:13.304 --> 18:14.548
I said warm eyes.

18:14.573 --> 18:16.541
What I actually meant was tired eyes.

18:16.566 --> 18:17.914
- I can see that.
- For sure.

18:17.939 --> 18:19.774
She just looks like
she's trying so hard.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.435
Quarter-life crisis. M-Midlife crisis.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.515
Well, she looks like
she's having a midlife crisis,

18:24.540 --> 18:27.283
but she's dressed like she's
having a quarter-life crisis.

18:27.308 --> 18:29.391
And her boots are new,
so that's a part of it.

18:29.416 --> 18:31.532
- That's a lot, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.701
Great.

18:35.009 --> 18:36.637
Thank you.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.085
- Uh...
- No.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.875
You were expecting
pit bulls and gangsters, right?

18:41.876 --> 18:43.946
- No, I was not.
- Uh-huh.

18:44.131 --> 18:45.679
Oh, my gosh, you have a bounce house?

18:45.704 --> 18:47.241
Well, it is my nephew's birthday party,

18:47.266 --> 18:49.150
so yes, I do have a bounce house.

18:49.175 --> 18:50.217
Yo, Alonso!

18:50.218 --> 18:51.833
My friend Laura needs your signatures.

18:51.858 --> 18:53.971
- Oh, yeah? What for?
- To make up for the time

18:53.972 --> 18:56.139
I was hanging with this guy
instead of working.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.600
Also, clean energy.

18:58.672 --> 19:00.423
I like clean energy.

19:00.478 --> 19:03.230
- Hold this one second?
- Yeah, what kinda clean energy?

19:03.231 --> 19:04.885
Get to signing.
I'm gonna get some drinks.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.517
Here you go.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.843
Uh, so, uh, right,
uh, fuel efficient cars.

19:13.517 --> 19:16.302
- Valerie, you forgot this.
- Anyone want to go to a Tavern?

19:16.327 --> 19:17.578
Thank you.

19:17.579 --> 19:18.583
You coming?

19:18.608 --> 19:20.414
No, I got plans.

19:20.415 --> 19:21.846
Hey, remember your first day of school,

19:21.871 --> 19:23.412
when everyone was hanging out,

19:23.437 --> 19:25.718
and how one kid sat alone in the corner,

19:25.743 --> 19:27.911
and he ended up being the Unabomber?

19:28.190 --> 19:29.793
Wow, you're an asshole.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.842
- After you.
- Thank you.

19:43.647 --> 19:46.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:46.212 --> 19:47.880
Um...

19:49.572 --> 19:51.392
- You hungry?
- Ravenous.

19:51.549 --> 19:54.111
- All right, uh, come on in.
- Okay.

19:54.699 --> 19:56.659
I got it.

20:03.067 --> 20:06.239
Ah, the anticipatory nacho plate.

20:06.316 --> 20:08.317
Let them never say I was unprepared.

20:13.676 --> 20:14.918
What?

20:14.943 --> 20:16.778
Nothing.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.950
So your dad.

20:20.163 --> 20:22.390
- What happened?
- Oh, um...

20:22.703 --> 20:24.037
Bottle of sleeping pills,

20:24.062 --> 20:26.063
right over there on the couch, actually.

20:26.064 --> 20:27.964
Oh, shit.

20:30.425 --> 20:32.134
Fuck, I'm sorry, Alex.

20:32.950 --> 20:35.011
At least it was clean.

20:36.113 --> 20:37.377
And the brother?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.297
Wake up every morning and bury it again.

20:42.290 --> 20:44.124
Hm, at least you're consistent.

20:44.149 --> 20:45.189
Yeah.

20:49.107 --> 20:52.847
You look like the sun touched
every part of you.

21:03.425 --> 21:04.717
Fun party.

21:04.742 --> 21:06.659
The perks of having a big family.

21:06.729 --> 21:09.506
Our last family gathering
was my grandfather's memorial.

21:09.507 --> 21:11.141
I'm sorry.

21:11.142 --> 21:12.429
Actually, it turns out
we're not even related,

21:12.454 --> 21:13.569
so I don't know if it evens counts.

21:17.365 --> 21:18.758
- No.
- <i>Si.</i>

21:25.615 --> 21:27.055
Uh...

21:27.315 --> 21:30.362
I got accepted into UCLA
from ELAC this fall.

21:30.439 --> 21:32.148
Way to bury the lede.

21:32.176 --> 21:34.502
I'm not trying to work at
a grocery store forever.

21:39.721 --> 21:41.638
Someone's got her eye on you.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.688
My mom? Yeah, just ignore her.

21:47.377 --> 21:49.461
Well, that's the risk you take
when you bring a girl home

21:49.486 --> 21:51.150
to meet the family on the first date,

21:51.230 --> 21:53.123
which I don't know if I've mentioned,

21:53.204 --> 21:54.877
pretty ballsy.

21:55.178 --> 21:57.924
You got in some strange guy's van.

21:58.049 --> 21:59.544
- Touché.
- Yeah.

22:01.534 --> 22:03.326
Okay, hold my drink.

22:03.327 --> 22:05.162
I gotta launch some eight-year-olds.

22:05.163 --> 22:07.205
You come here! <i>¡Vámonos!</i>

22:07.206 --> 22:08.901
Let's go!

22:23.351 --> 22:25.616
_

22:25.641 --> 22:28.277
- Oh, what an interesting first class.
- I know, right?

22:28.302 --> 22:30.910
It was a little nerve-racking.
but we all made it through unscathed.

22:30.935 --> 22:33.732
- Honestly, I think Joanna is a genius.
- _

22:33.733 --> 22:37.030
I mean, that level
of honesty is so rare.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.637
- It's refreshing.
- It's beautiful.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.917
- Right?
- Yeah, I kinda feel like

22:40.942 --> 22:42.462
she's trying to keep us on our heels

22:42.487 --> 22:45.204
to deflect any potential
criticism of her teaching style.

22:45.229 --> 22:48.736
Yeah, somehow I didn't think
storytelling was a contact sport.

22:48.737 --> 22:49.762
Yeah, right?

22:49.787 --> 22:53.529
I mean, yes, I am a divorced mom.
Wow, yeah.

22:53.554 --> 22:57.340
And yeah, maybe I'm in a...
some weird half-crisis thing.

22:57.365 --> 23:01.886
And my eyes are probably tired,
because I spent all day

23:01.911 --> 23:03.579
figuring out other people's problems.

23:03.613 --> 23:06.536
But you know what?
I already know that shit.

23:06.614 --> 23:07.755
I do!

23:07.780 --> 23:10.022
Just like you know that
you're kinda schlubby,

23:10.084 --> 23:11.782
and people don't take you seriously,

23:11.809 --> 23:14.261
because of the way you dress.
I love your outfit, by the way.

23:14.286 --> 23:15.514
I do too.

23:15.539 --> 23:17.041
I don't know why I said I didn't.

23:17.066 --> 23:18.981
I think because I'm just jealous.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.051
- I love your hair.
- Oh, thank you.

23:21.076 --> 23:21.989
That's so nice.

23:21.990 --> 23:23.437
- See? And you know what?
- That's really nice.

23:23.517 --> 23:26.317
Even if you didn't,
sorry, but who cares?

23:26.423 --> 23:30.284
It's your hair, it's your outfit,
it's your shape.

23:30.456 --> 23:32.251
I mean, own it.

23:32.483 --> 23:35.741
Own it, just like
I'm gonna own these boots,

23:35.868 --> 23:38.375
which I did in fact buy today.

23:38.415 --> 23:41.550
Oh, I knew it. I knew it!

23:41.575 --> 23:44.052
I'm gonna get another one.
Anyone want one?

23:44.077 --> 23:45.466
- You want one?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

23:45.491 --> 23:47.677
- That's awesome.
- No, but seriously,

23:48.937 --> 23:50.146
how did you know I got 'em today?

23:50.943 --> 23:53.038
Check your sole.

23:53.608 --> 23:55.317
Check my soul?

23:59.110 --> 24:00.277
See?

24:03.891 --> 24:05.282
They look good on you.

24:05.773 --> 24:07.527
Very good.

24:13.047 --> 24:15.458
Oh, my God.

24:15.459 --> 24:17.640
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.630
Oh, my God. That's a real muscle, right?

24:20.631 --> 24:21.340
Yeah.

24:27.872 --> 24:30.963
I used to be happy
without responsibility...

24:31.097 --> 24:34.981
the freedom to choose different
partners, different nights...

24:35.092 --> 24:37.461
but I don't know,

24:38.065 --> 24:40.314
after you and I ended, it just... it...

24:40.961 --> 24:43.248
it wasn't the same.

24:43.675 --> 24:45.648
I've been known to have that effect.

24:45.908 --> 24:47.616
Yeah, I...

24:47.795 --> 24:50.835
I still don't think
that there is just one person

24:50.934 --> 24:52.900
for any of us,

24:53.538 --> 24:56.527
but I didn't wanna

24:56.760 --> 24:59.353
run the risk of missing out again,

25:00.552 --> 25:02.578
and my body agreed.

25:03.913 --> 25:06.051
I'm happy for you.

25:07.264 --> 25:09.306
You opened my eyes.

25:09.568 --> 25:10.907
Thank you.

25:11.473 --> 25:13.533
You're welcome.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.900
It feels like so long ago.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.140
Not even a year.

25:18.198 --> 25:20.120
You didn't have room for me back then.

25:21.056 --> 25:23.196
But I don't know,
I think you've changed too.

25:28.404 --> 25:30.944
I think I'll have one more glass.

25:31.144 --> 25:33.937
- You know what, pour me one.
- Yeah?

25:34.476 --> 25:36.398
Yeah.

26:29.618 --> 26:31.698
She said you took something?

26:41.993 --> 26:43.620
Why would you do that?

26:45.544 --> 26:46.694
I don't know.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.193
The best part about school
was always the extracurriculars.

27:14.128 --> 27:15.388
- Hey.
- Hm?

27:15.721 --> 27:17.615
What do you really think of me?

27:18.436 --> 27:22.412
Uh, yeah, I think we've done
enough of that.

27:22.437 --> 27:24.211
Oh, come on, just...

27:24.408 --> 27:26.544
look, I'm ready for it.
Just lay it on me.

27:26.924 --> 27:30.330
Uh, you're a little entitled,

27:30.404 --> 27:32.810
not uncommon for someone of your age.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.230
Physique...

27:34.471 --> 27:38.107
you maybe confuse having style

27:38.189 --> 27:39.827
with having a sense of self,

27:39.925 --> 27:43.970
and your hair is just, um...

27:44.144 --> 27:45.746
- Yeah.
- Oh.

27:45.771 --> 27:48.198
But you're very pretty, and, uh,

27:48.291 --> 27:50.207
you're wonderful in bed.

27:50.801 --> 27:53.453
And my car is here.

27:54.245 --> 27:56.037
Oh, wait, you called a car?

27:56.920 --> 27:58.133
I did.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.354
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:02.853 --> 28:04.687
- I'll see you at class.
- See ya.

28:06.328 --> 28:07.620
You're a fraud.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.557
You're a huckster.
You've been doing yoga?

28:10.736 --> 28:13.442
I know. I know, I know.

28:13.467 --> 28:16.094
Actually, in the spirit of
full disclosure, I did it too.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.755
- Okay.
- Only for a week.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.688
Oh, this town will just
turn ya upside down.

28:20.713 --> 28:22.848
Yeah, it will. You want another glass?

28:23.266 --> 28:26.238
No, no, one's my limit.

28:26.402 --> 28:29.645
And, uh, it's getting late.

28:29.823 --> 28:30.845
Yeah.

28:33.385 --> 28:35.047
- One last question.
- Shoot.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.954
Did you ever watch "Finding Dory"?

28:39.201 --> 28:41.661
- No.
- Me neither.

28:42.032 --> 28:43.866
We could watch it.

28:44.558 --> 28:46.266
No.

28:46.532 --> 28:47.631
We can't.

29:01.263 --> 29:03.938
It's not mine, is it?

29:05.295 --> 29:06.767
The sprout?

29:07.720 --> 29:09.840
No, it's not.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.119
Good-bye, Alex.
