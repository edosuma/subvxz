00:00.680 --> 00:02.940
Previously on Kyle XY...

00:03.437 --> 00:06.322
I can't be with you when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

00:06.357 --> 00:08.858
- You could never lose me.
- I already have.

00:08.893 --> 00:12.428
- I'm Cassidy.
- There is a foreign hottie who seems into you.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.097
- You're available.
- I guess.

00:14.365 --> 00:16.399
Guess? Is there a romantic
interest I'm not aware of?

00:16.534 --> 00:18.334
- Only Kyle.
- Kyle?

00:18.369 --> 00:22.421
I'm sorry, I really am,
but it, the sex, is done.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.508
Why would you invite Lori Trager
here if you were meeting me?

00:25.543 --> 00:27.844
- I see the problem.
- You told me not to see her.

00:27.878 --> 00:29.379
I thought you'd be happy about it.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.597
Watch out!

00:34.602 --> 00:36.102
Nicole!

00:36.103 --> 00:37.453
We've done all we can.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.656
Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.

00:39.990 --> 00:43.259
Think it could help Nicole? There is
one place you might be able to get some.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.528
- My mother is dying.
- I have what you need.

00:45.663 --> 00:47.430
- I can get it to you.
- Thank you.

00:47.565 --> 00:50.200
But you have to do
something for me. Join us.

00:50.234 --> 00:52.318
At Latnok. It's your choice.

00:52.736 --> 00:56.739
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today
because I knew it could save Nicole's life.

00:56.774 --> 01:00.510
Now, if you ever harm him or
anyone else in that family,

01:00.661 --> 01:03.012
- I'll kill you.
- She's gonna be OK.

01:04.782 --> 01:05.798
Thank you.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.603
Kyle!

01:31.325 --> 01:34.444
- How's Mrs. Trager?
- She's OK.

01:34.478 --> 01:36.496
Getting her strength back slowly.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.081
We're taking good care of her.

01:38.249 --> 01:39.481
That's great.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.118
I was gonna come by.
I mean, I should have.

01:42.152 --> 01:43.920
But I was really busy at work.

01:43.954 --> 01:45.455
That's OK.

01:48.158 --> 01:50.226
You don't have to avoid
The Rack, you know.

01:50.261 --> 01:53.096
- Oh, I'm not avoiding it.
- Because even though we're not...

01:53.230 --> 01:57.100
It doesn't mean you have
to give up smoothies.

01:57.134 --> 01:59.035
I'd still make you one
if you wanted me to.

01:59.103 --> 02:01.004
Amanda, I still like smoothies.

02:01.039 --> 02:03.106
- You do?
- Of course.

02:05.109 --> 02:06.726
- I've just been busy.
- Right.

02:06.777 --> 02:09.078
Sure.

02:11.014 --> 02:14.050
- How about lasagna?
- A lasagna smoothie?

02:14.084 --> 02:16.318
I could make one and bring it by.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.721
- Want to make lasagna for me?
- For the family.

02:18.756 --> 02:21.391
Your mom probably doesn't
feel like cooking nowadays.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.459
That'd be great.

02:26.030 --> 02:27.830
- Well, I gotta...
- Me too.

02:31.635 --> 02:33.002
Lasagna!

02:38.726 --> 02:40.877
- What did she want?
- Were you listening?

02:41.011 --> 02:43.513
No. I was watching.

02:43.647 --> 02:45.114
She just wanted to say hello.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.784
What's the point in dumping
you if she still wants to talk?

02:47.985 --> 02:51.521
- She was being polite.
- She broke up with you and hurt your feelings.

02:51.555 --> 02:53.823
- That's not very polite.
- I'm getting over it.

02:55.626 --> 02:59.362
- I'm trying.
- Today should help take your mind off it.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.666
I don't want the family to
know I'm going to Latnok.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.034
I don't want to upset Nicole.

03:05.235 --> 03:07.103
- Then don't go.
- I've made a deal.

03:07.771 --> 03:11.007
And I've seen what they're capable of. If
I don't go today, it won't be the end of it.

03:13.243 --> 03:17.714
- So you won't say anything?
- I won't.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.217
I'm glad I can count on you.

03:36.270 --> 03:38.880
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 6:
Welcome To Latnok</font>

03:44.375 --> 03:48.461
- I've waited a long time for this day.
- Why are we at a university?

03:48.496 --> 03:51.631
What did you expect, to
go to my underground lair?

03:53.167 --> 03:54.917
It wouldn't surprise me.

03:54.952 --> 03:56.586
Well, maybe this will.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.755
I know your previous
impressions of Latnok

03:58.756 --> 04:02.225
have been not so great, but I'm
determined to change all that.

04:05.312 --> 04:09.399
I want you to see that we're not
about stuffy suits or mad scientists.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.234
What are you about?

04:13.404 --> 04:14.904
The future.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.825
These are the best and
brightest minds on campus,

04:18.858 --> 04:20.976
but none of them hold a candle to you.

04:21.161 --> 04:25.248
- What do they know about me?
- I told them you're a genius.

04:25.282 --> 04:27.141
A prodigy. A real find.

04:27.176 --> 04:29.001
But that's all they know.

04:29.453 --> 04:33.222
As far as they're concerned,
you're just my latest recruit.

04:33.257 --> 04:35.958
The one I wanted most of all.

04:45.803 --> 04:48.137
- That sounds pretty.
- Thanks.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.939
I'm writing a song or my mom.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.357
Don't you want her to feel better?

04:51.442 --> 04:52.942
Yeah, that's why I'm...

04:57.347 --> 05:01.851
Don't you have anything else you
could be doing, like magically
lighting small animals on fire?

05:01.886 --> 05:04.287
- Why would I do that?
- It's a joke.

05:05.989 --> 05:08.524
- Never mind.
- I need a favor.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.760
And you've teed it up so successfully.

05:10.794 --> 05:13.029
Please don't tell Kyle
anything about Cassidy.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.081
Oh.

05:15.132 --> 05:19.135
Finally you've opened your eyes
up to the hotness next door.

05:19.169 --> 05:22.738
- You won't tell him?
- Why do you care if Kyle knows you've been seeing Cassidy?

05:22.773 --> 05:25.842
I just don't think he'd like it.

05:25.876 --> 05:30.245
Whatever. But my silence
comes with a price.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.316
The keys to your apartment.
Mark and I need privacy.

05:33.350 --> 05:37.520
- But it's mine.
- Yet you want me to keep your secret.

05:37.554 --> 05:40.156
Hmm. What a predicament.

05:40.290 --> 05:43.025
- I thought you were done being mean to me.
- This isn't mean.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.562
This is sibling politics.
Kill or be killed. Ask Josh.

05:46.697 --> 05:48.464
So do we have a deal or what?

05:50.634 --> 05:53.202
- We have a deal.
- You look great.

05:53.337 --> 05:54.904
How do you feel?

05:55.038 --> 05:57.089
Well, I can finally go
up and down the stairs

05:57.508 --> 05:59.909
without feeling like a Ginsu
knife is piercing me in the lungs,

06:00.043 --> 06:02.712
so pretty good. Oh, scratch that.

06:02.713 --> 06:05.515
- What's that?
- Hospital bill.

06:08.352 --> 06:10.019
- How much?
- Wow.

06:10.187 --> 06:13.306
Too many pages...

06:14.725 --> 06:18.361
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, is that before insurance?

06:18.395 --> 06:20.062
I wish.

06:20.063 --> 06:23.165
Stephen, we don't have this kind
of money. What are we gonna do?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.151
What are we gonna do about what?

06:25.202 --> 06:27.236
Uh... dinner.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.156
You know what? I... I
don't feel like cooking.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.946
- Is she OK?
- Yeah.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.633
She'll be fine. Don't worry about it.

07:01.772 --> 07:03.673
Is this sponsored by the university?

07:03.807 --> 07:05.324
The university gives us the space

07:05.826 --> 07:07.877
in exchange for bragging
rights generated by our ideas.

07:07.911 --> 07:11.581
- What kind of ideas?
- Advances in science, technology.

07:11.748 --> 07:14.684
Working towards a better, more
sophisticated civilization.

07:14.719 --> 07:17.620
I don't have a great history
with people who say that.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.855
Yeah, well, forget about everybody else.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.591
We're the real deal.

07:22.793 --> 07:25.895
And this lovely little pixie is Jackie.

07:25.929 --> 07:28.680
Who holds the record for darts,

07:28.715 --> 07:31.267
Guitar Hero and the longest keg stand.

07:31.401 --> 07:34.870
Let me know if I can kick your
ass at any of them later, cutie.

07:34.905 --> 07:38.190
- What's she working on?
- Nuclear suitcase bomb.

07:40.444 --> 07:42.361
Plants, mate. Growth patterns.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.647
My goal is to accelerate
the maturation period.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.883
A system like hers could
help eradicate world hunger.

07:50.454 --> 07:54.490
Have you considered binding FT proteins to
activate the nucleus of the meristem cells?

07:55.859 --> 07:58.894
No. No, I haven't.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.299
So, the great mind has finally
come to play with us mortals.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.252
Yeah, most people open with
"hello," but that will work.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.471
Nathanial Harrison, Kyle Trager.

08:08.506 --> 08:10.606
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.076
And goodbye. I've got work to do.

08:14.344 --> 08:17.229
Why don't you tell Kyle here what
you're working on? Maybe he can help.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.748
Uh, no offense, Boy Genius,

08:19.783 --> 08:22.084
but I graduated high school at 13,

08:22.152 --> 08:25.788
and I have an IQ of
156. I think I got it.

08:28.191 --> 08:30.692
Nate considers himself
top dog around here.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.863
He thinks I'm an idiot because
I have the IQ of a normal person.

08:33.996 --> 08:37.433
I don't take it personally.
I've got better hair.

08:37.467 --> 08:40.870
So, make yourself at
home. Get to know everyone.

08:40.904 --> 08:42.837
- I believe you already know...
- Mark?

08:44.608 --> 08:46.308
I'm glad we finally got you in here.

08:54.885 --> 08:58.087
Easy there. You're hitting a little
too close to the promised land.

08:58.221 --> 09:01.757
I love the never-ending role reversal.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.476
- The who?
- With us.

09:03.643 --> 09:07.396
First it was you who
didn't want to, you know.

09:07.447 --> 09:11.167
Then it was me. And now it's you.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.618
Wait a minute.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.237
Were those little
twinkly finger maneuvers

09:15.238 --> 09:17.656
your way of telling me that
you've changed your mind?

09:17.824 --> 09:20.793
I don't know. Would
that be such a bad thing?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.646
Are you testing me? Is this a test?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.915
Josh, I'm not testing you.

09:28.719 --> 09:30.286
I just missed you.

09:31.755 --> 09:35.825
I missed you, too. Really bad.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.664
- Oh! Ahh!...to have an exorcism!
- Don't you knock?

09:58.749 --> 10:02.168
- Don't you lock?
- It's OK. You can look.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.787
Oh! I'm so, so, so sorry.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.290
- But I need to talk to you.
- Now?

10:08.325 --> 10:10.459
My cue to leave.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.865
<i>- Bye.
- Did you get a How to Screw Your Brother Over handbook</i>

10:16.900 --> 10:20.336
- the day I was born?
- No, but you were lucky it was me and not Mom!

10:20.470 --> 10:22.538
Which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

10:22.606 --> 10:26.192
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.245
I caught a glimpse of the
hospital bill. They can't pay it.

10:29.312 --> 10:30.312
How do you know that?

10:30.781 --> 10:32.014
They walked me through the finances

10:32.249 --> 10:34.383
- when they made their will.
- They have a will?

10:34.451 --> 10:36.752
Yes, idiot, and now we have a problem.

10:36.787 --> 10:39.989
So, where's our chief problem solver?

10:40.123 --> 10:43.042
I've been involved for two years.
I know I didn't tell you or Lori.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.328
- I swear to you, I met her totally by accident.
- Lori needs to know.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.533
OK. You're right. I'll tell her.

10:52.169 --> 10:54.220
I know this is a bit
overwhelming for you,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.605
your first day and all,
but we're good people here.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.557
And we have the best
resources available.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.726
It's all about discovery
and opportunity.

11:00.727 --> 11:04.180
- Scientific and financial.
- Financial?

11:04.214 --> 11:07.283
Yeah, we're encouraged to chase
grants and enter competitions.

11:07.317 --> 11:10.019
For myself, I cleared
more than 80,000 last year.

11:10.054 --> 11:13.072
So, have we won you over yet?

11:15.959 --> 11:17.076
See you later.

11:18.361 --> 11:20.296
I'm here to pay a debt, keep my word.

11:20.397 --> 11:23.032
Beyond that, I have no
interest in being part of this.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.836
If you can't let go of past impressions,
your time here is not going to be productive.

11:26.903 --> 11:30.673
So go home. Seriously, go home.

11:30.707 --> 11:34.977
Sleep on it. If you're not back
tomorrow morning, then so be it.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.513
Debt paid.

11:37.547 --> 11:39.615
Deal?

11:41.384 --> 11:43.135
Deal.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.721
There has to be something we can do.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.307
We were hoping you could
help us figure that out.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.627
- Where's Jessi?
- Out.

11:51.662 --> 11:55.397
We figured out this was the one place we could
privately summit without Mom and Dad stumbling in.

11:55.532 --> 11:57.666
So, what's our strategy?
I make minimum wage,

11:57.701 --> 11:59.952
and this slacker over
here doesn't work at all.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.204
I could take my guitar and
play on a street corner.

12:02.239 --> 12:05.274
You'd do better without the guitar.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.742
Hey, enough kidding around.

12:06.877 --> 12:08.877
We're talking thousands of dollars here.

12:08.912 --> 12:11.847
We're never gonna come
up with that kind of cash.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.300
I have an idea.

12:17.454 --> 12:20.422
<i>I had been released
from my debt to Cassidy,</i>

12:20.457 --> 12:22.458
<i>but now a new debt had arrived.</i>

12:22.592 --> 12:24.535
<i>What was the price I'd have to pay</i>

12:24.570 --> 12:26.478
<i>for the situation I had created?</i>

12:26.646 --> 12:28.681
<i>And, in the end, would it be worth it?</i>

12:28.732 --> 12:31.032
<i>I had no way of knowing.</i>

12:31.067 --> 12:33.202
<i>But I also knew I had no choice.</i>

12:42.162 --> 12:44.847
<i>Hello, this is Cassidy.
Please leave a message.</i>

12:44.851 --> 12:47.950
Cassidy, it's Kyle.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.852
I'll be back tomorrow.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.983
Good morning.

12:57.368 --> 13:00.086
I need to know about all available
competitions with a cash prize.

13:00.221 --> 13:02.389
Suddenly the entrepreneur, eh?

13:02.523 --> 13:06.409
Um, no problem. Mark
can help you with that.

13:22.109 --> 13:25.712
Hey. A hoverboard competition.

13:25.746 --> 13:27.881
Um, the deadline's...

13:28.015 --> 13:29.683
Thirty-six hours and 23 minutes.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.918
Judged here on campus.
It's exactly what I need.

13:31.953 --> 13:34.020
No, I think what you need is a breath.

13:34.722 --> 13:38.291
I know how smart you are, but even if you manage
to construct the prototype, highly unlikely,

13:38.326 --> 13:40.243
the real question is
whether it will work.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.395
Nate's been jamming on this for a year.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.331
- He's working the bugs out.
- I have to try.

13:44.832 --> 13:47.067
- I really...
- If you could show me where I could work.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.806
Yeah, um, we'll set
you up a station here.

13:58.512 --> 14:02.215
So, head over heels or a broken heart?

14:02.266 --> 14:04.517
Most songs are about one or the other.

14:04.652 --> 14:07.771
- How do you know I'm writing a song?
- I know you pretty well.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.189
Yeah. Yes, you do.

14:09.273 --> 14:12.642
I'm hoping if I write enough
songs, I can sell them.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.527
So which one is it?

14:17.431 --> 14:18.999
She's gonna make me say it.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.402
How's that guy, Mark?

14:22.453 --> 14:25.897
That guy, Mark, is... good.

14:25.932 --> 14:29.342
- Good.
- And you are...?

14:29.377 --> 14:31.745
- Good.
- Good.

14:35.283 --> 14:36.883
I guess I'll see you around.

14:42.056 --> 14:44.758
Sounds like a whole lot of
goodness going on around here.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.644
I'm hoping we can move
past the awkward stage.

14:47.645 --> 14:51.798
One minute you're telling each other everything,
and the next you don't know what to say.

14:51.833 --> 14:52.866
Exactly.

14:55.703 --> 14:59.406
Just because you break up with a guy doesn't
mean you stop having feelings for him.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.009
I know. I don't want to, but
sometimes I still do. I just...

15:03.044 --> 15:05.546
I can't get past the whole Jessi thing.

15:05.581 --> 15:08.048
Kyle does not have feelings for Jessi.

15:08.082 --> 15:09.649
Trust me, I would kill him.

15:10.184 --> 15:13.320
She's after him. Jessi's the kind
of girl who gets what she wants.

15:14.588 --> 15:17.357
Jessi likes someone else now.

15:17.391 --> 15:20.727
- She does?
- She's over Kyle.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.179
So, maybe, you don't have to be.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.735
Jessi's got a sweet secret pad.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.373
What's all this?

15:33.407 --> 15:36.443
Everything I can afford to part
with and not walk around naked.

15:36.610 --> 15:39.612
- Why is it here?
- 'Cause if I'm gonna sell everything I own online,

15:39.814 --> 15:43.850
- I don't want my parents to know. That's where you come in.
- Not remotely following.

15:43.885 --> 15:47.887
- You'll be my boxer/shipper.
- I thought you brought me here for more exciting purposes.

15:47.922 --> 15:50.373
That can be the reward
for a job well done.

15:51.859 --> 15:53.927
How did you get the keys
to this place, anyway?

15:53.961 --> 15:55.695
Lori blackmailed them out of Jessi,

15:56.130 --> 15:59.065
- I blackmailed 'em out of Lori.
- What do you have on Lori?

15:59.100 --> 16:00.834
Nothing. I just inferred things.

16:00.869 --> 16:02.184
She's a guilty person.

16:02.219 --> 16:04.204
You're cute when
you're being diabolical.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.475
- I just really want to help my mom.
- I know you do.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.810
And I'm happy to help.

16:10.845 --> 16:14.648
But maybe we can get to
the reward part first?

16:14.683 --> 16:18.451
Someone's in a rush to
get to the good stuff.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.958
Here we are, alone in our
secret little apartment.

16:25.092 --> 16:27.160
No fears of getting caught.

16:27.244 --> 16:31.131
Do you have any idea how many couples
would kill for a deal like this?

16:32.917 --> 16:35.735
Or how much they'd pay for it.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.537
You're a genius!

16:40.641 --> 16:43.243
Oh. Apparently, now I'm also a pimp.

16:54.255 --> 16:57.891
You really think you can build a
working prototype in less than two days?

17:00.694 --> 17:03.563
- Maybe you're not as smart as they think you are.
- Maybe so.

17:03.598 --> 17:06.065
This isn't like playing with Legos.

17:06.099 --> 17:10.904
- There's no way you can finish.
- Your board is burning.

17:17.461 --> 17:21.330
- What was that for?
- My tomato plants doubled their growth in 12 hours.

17:21.482 --> 17:23.665
- That's amazing.
- Thanks to you.

17:25.618 --> 17:27.720
- You're so nice.
- Well, why wouldn't I be?

17:37.788 --> 17:40.339
- How are you feeling?
- Much better.

17:40.374 --> 17:42.158
Good, because I have some news.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.260
I made a decision. I've
been thinking about it.

17:44.428 --> 17:46.629
- I'm not gonna go to college.
- What?

17:47.030 --> 17:50.266
It doesn't make sense for me to spend four
years when all I care about is my music.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.735
- Lori!
- Plus, it's so expensive.

17:52.769 --> 17:54.503
Lori, you know I love you

17:54.538 --> 17:56.472
and I try to respect your life choices,

17:56.606 --> 17:58.240
but this is a non-starter for me.

17:58.275 --> 18:00.343
- But...
- Please don't make me play

18:00.577 --> 18:03.412
the mom who just got out of the
hospital and has a weak heart card.

18:05.449 --> 18:08.367
OK. You need time to process.

18:08.402 --> 18:10.903
There's not enough time
in the world for this one.

18:10.954 --> 18:13.205
- Let me get that.
- I've got it.

18:13.357 --> 18:15.374
- Mom!
- Lori, I've got it.

18:15.409 --> 18:18.694
All right. Suit yourself.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.418
- Let me get it.
- I've got... I've got it.

18:25.469 --> 18:28.103
- You're not supposed to get it.
- Well, why not?

18:28.138 --> 18:31.474
Because we're supposed to treat you
delicately until you feel better.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.508
- Who told you that?
- Lori.

18:33.543 --> 18:37.346
- Since when do you listen to Lori?
- I guess you're right.

18:39.649 --> 18:43.219
OK, so, uh, where are you coming from?

18:43.253 --> 18:46.489
- I was out.
- Just wandering the streets aimlessly?

18:46.623 --> 18:48.791
Why would I do that?

18:48.925 --> 18:51.961
No, I meant you could tell
me more if you want to.

18:51.995 --> 18:53.763
No, I can't.

18:53.797 --> 18:56.966
- Why not?
- Because I'm not supposed to upset you.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.834
- Lori again?
- Kyle.

18:58.869 --> 19:01.136
Kyle? What does he think would upset me?

19:01.171 --> 19:04.006
I really shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.942
I... I think you should.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.447
I think I did something really bad.

19:11.581 --> 19:12.948
And I don't want Kyle to know,

19:13.250 --> 19:16.152
but I'm worried that what I did
might affect what he's doing.

19:16.286 --> 19:19.388
- and then he won't realize what's being done.
- What happened?

19:21.324 --> 19:24.293
Jessi, tell me.

19:24.428 --> 19:26.662
I can't believe you're
working with them.

19:26.696 --> 19:30.066
It was the only way to get
you help when you were so sick.

19:30.101 --> 19:33.436
- I had to make the deal.
- Now you need to unmake it.

19:33.471 --> 19:35.104
- Nicole.
- I'm serious, Kyle.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.473
I don't want you involved
with those people.

19:37.507 --> 19:40.309
- It's not as bad as you think.
- Not as bad?

19:40.444 --> 19:43.979
They followed you, they toyed
with you, they kidnapped Amanda!

19:44.014 --> 19:46.115
- So far there's been nothing.
- No, don't do that.

19:46.716 --> 19:49.852
Don't tell me anything other than that
your relationship with them is over.

19:51.721 --> 19:54.623
It can't be over. I'm sorry.

20:00.297 --> 20:02.682
- How could you tell her?
- I was worried.

20:02.816 --> 20:04.784
I don't like that you're
involved with them.

20:04.985 --> 20:07.453
I don't like that I'm involved
with them! But I have to be.

20:07.488 --> 20:09.856
Why? Why can't you just walk away?

20:10.057 --> 20:13.526
I had the chance, but Stephen and Nicole
ran into money trouble, so now I can't.

20:13.561 --> 20:16.396
- Money trouble?
- Yes.

20:16.430 --> 20:18.965
The hospital bill is really high.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.202
Oh. I didn't know that.

20:23.237 --> 20:25.405
I have to help them,
no matter what it takes.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.875
Why are you always helping
people, even if it's hurting you?

20:28.910 --> 20:30.777
Because that's what you do, Jessi.

20:30.911 --> 20:33.813
- That's what people do.
- But Cassidy's a bad person.

20:33.847 --> 20:34.914
I don't trust him.

20:35.182 --> 20:36.816
What do you know about Cassidy?

20:41.388 --> 20:44.090
Jessi, what do you know about Cassidy?

20:49.663 --> 20:51.464
I met him awhile ago.

20:51.598 --> 20:54.467
He didn't tell me he was
part of Latnok, at first.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.003
- What did he tell you?
- I thought he was my neighbor.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.138
He lived down the hall
from Sarah's apartment,

20:59.173 --> 21:02.275
probably as a way of keeping tabs on me.

21:02.326 --> 21:05.979
He told me that Latnok is changing and
that you and I can help with that change.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.514
- And you believed him?
- I didn't know what to believe.

21:08.549 --> 21:10.582
Sarah hated them, but then she left.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.652
He was there, being
so kind and supportive

21:12.753 --> 21:15.154
and telling me how important
we both were to the future.

21:15.289 --> 21:17.390
When Nicole got injured
and she needed help...

21:17.624 --> 21:20.159
- You suggested I go see him.
- You would have gone anyway.

21:20.194 --> 21:23.162
But you encouraged me without
telling me the whole story!

21:23.197 --> 21:26.099
You did exactly what Cassidy wanted!

21:26.233 --> 21:30.303
- I'm sorry.
- I'm working with the people I trust least in this world.

21:30.337 --> 21:33.172
I never thought you'd be just like them.

21:39.313 --> 21:41.147
Hello?

21:41.281 --> 21:45.051
An appointment for what? What apartment?

21:45.986 --> 21:47.403
Hello?

21:47.621 --> 21:50.406
That was one of Josh's friends,
canceling a 10:30 appointment.

21:50.457 --> 21:51.624
What appointment?

21:52.059 --> 21:54.093
He hung up. Said something
about an apartment.

21:55.562 --> 21:59.966
- What do you know about this?
- Nothing. Not a thing.

22:02.236 --> 22:06.139
- Zero.
- You want to try that again?

22:06.174 --> 22:09.942
Four-ninety-eight,
499, 500. Not bad.

22:09.977 --> 22:14.047
Except for the fact I've had to clean
this place five times in the past 24 hours.

22:14.081 --> 22:18.183
- We could hire a maid.
- That'd cut into our profits.

22:18.218 --> 22:22.088
The last party left the bathroom looking
like a chunk-style soup factory exploded.

22:22.222 --> 22:25.258
I've still got to scrub
the toilet before the 10:30.

22:25.409 --> 22:27.360
10:46.

22:27.528 --> 22:30.195
- Maybe they're not coming.
- Well, they'd better come!

22:30.230 --> 22:33.666
One appointment is 50 dollars less
stress my mom has to worry about.

22:33.801 --> 22:36.285
Amen.

22:36.336 --> 22:39.005
I'll get the door, you
manage the facilities.

22:42.259 --> 22:45.578
Josh?

22:45.712 --> 22:48.114
Don't think you guys'll get
out of paying full price.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.650
What, exactly, are we
paying full price for?

22:51.602 --> 22:53.453
Dad! Mom!

22:54.688 --> 22:56.456
Great to see you!

22:58.092 --> 22:59.976
- Andy.
- Leaving. Now.

23:00.227 --> 23:03.563
I'm late for my family summit, which
hopefully goes better than this is about to.

23:05.032 --> 23:08.901
- What is going on here?
- A little entrepreneurial venture.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.320
Are you in some kind of trouble?

23:11.371 --> 23:13.623
You mean before right now?

23:13.657 --> 23:16.742
- Why would you need money?
- Andy's birthday.

23:16.794 --> 23:19.378
- She's expecting diamonds.
- Well, then start mining.

23:19.413 --> 23:21.347
Because you're gonna give all this money back,

23:21.381 --> 23:23.633
and you're gonna clear
out of here immediately.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.486
- I just wanted to...
- Just wanted to what?

23:26.520 --> 23:29.956
Tell us, please, because we
really want to understand.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.666
Nothing.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.342
I'm sorry.

23:33.393 --> 23:35.228
I suck.

23:37.514 --> 23:41.868
Am I on too many painkillers, or is there
something seriously wrong with our children?

23:41.902 --> 23:46.239
- Don't you ever sleep?
- This has to be done.

23:48.609 --> 23:51.511
You know, I know you're only
into it for the prize money now,

23:51.645 --> 23:56.499
but, Kyle, I really think
you're gonna like it here.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.368
- Why?
- Well...

23:59.419 --> 24:01.053
I know, for me,

24:01.088 --> 24:03.656
it is the first time I can
remember, I'm in a place

24:03.690 --> 24:06.959
where I'm not this super-smart
outsider. We all are.

24:08.462 --> 24:10.162
It's my home.

24:10.197 --> 24:12.932
I guess I have a different
definition of home.

24:15.936 --> 24:19.906
Uh, speaking of, I
haven't talked to Lori yet.

24:19.940 --> 24:22.775
Do you have any tips

24:22.809 --> 24:25.778
on how to keep her from hating me?

24:25.812 --> 24:27.496
You're asking the wrong person

24:27.531 --> 24:29.974
about keeping secrets
from his girlfriend.

24:30.009 --> 24:32.418
Whoa. Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend?

24:32.553 --> 24:34.286
Not anymore.

24:34.321 --> 24:37.056
- Is she hot?
- Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.

24:37.090 --> 24:39.325
In other words, totally
off-limits to you.

24:39.376 --> 24:40.726
Amanda?

24:40.794 --> 24:43.246
- That's a pretty name.
- Leave her out of this.

24:49.970 --> 24:53.055
What's this? You're not satisfied
with moving into my project?

24:53.223 --> 24:56.259
You've got to steal
my materials now, too?

24:56.310 --> 24:57.410
I didn't steal them.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.395
Cassidy told him he
could use our supplies.

24:59.430 --> 25:02.215
Was I talking to you?

25:02.349 --> 25:04.983
Look, you can't just waltz
in here and take over.

25:05.018 --> 25:07.820
- I don't want to take over anything.
- Who are you, anyway?

25:07.854 --> 25:10.439
Where'd you come from and
where'd you learn to make that?

25:10.490 --> 25:12.925
- I'm self-taught.
- That's impossible.

25:13.060 --> 25:16.062
Is this kindergarten? We
share. We help each other.

25:16.096 --> 25:18.464
Well, I'm not helping him.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.551
- Kyle isn't here.
- I'm not here to see Kyle.

25:38.602 --> 25:41.153
I made a lasagna. To help out.

25:41.188 --> 25:44.090
OK. I'll take it.

25:44.124 --> 25:45.958
I told you, Kyle isn't here.

25:45.993 --> 25:48.160
And I said I'm not here to see him.

25:48.195 --> 25:50.496
Is that why your eyes are
darting all over for him?

25:50.597 --> 25:53.532
Why do you even care? You
already have a new boyfriend.

25:53.567 --> 25:55.101
I don't have a boyfriend.

25:55.235 --> 25:57.669
That's what Lori said.

25:57.704 --> 26:00.273
Here. Just take the stupid lasagna.

26:09.483 --> 26:12.001
I heard about the Nate
thing. Sorry about that.

26:12.052 --> 26:14.487
- Ignore him.
- Should I ignore

26:14.521 --> 26:17.657
that you were conspiring
with Jessi to get me in here?

26:17.791 --> 26:19.859
She told you about that, huh?

26:19.993 --> 26:21.727
- Good.
- Good?

26:21.762 --> 26:24.230
We've liked the idea
of her here for awhile,

26:24.364 --> 26:27.233
but so far she hasn't proved
to be a very trustworthy girl.

26:27.367 --> 26:29.435
I'm glad to hear that
she's honest with you.

26:29.569 --> 26:31.337
Maybe there is room
for both of you here.

26:31.571 --> 26:33.339
I don't want Jessi to
have any part of this.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.674
Not after everything you've
done to her. And to me.

26:35.709 --> 26:38.711
You have to understand, they
wanted you here desperately.

26:38.845 --> 26:41.380
- Who?
- The old guard, stuffy suits.

26:41.415 --> 26:43.749
They put enormous pressure
on me to bring you in.

26:43.784 --> 26:45.818
They wanted their greatest achievement.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.920
You still haven't even told me for what.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.955
Do you not see?

26:49.990 --> 26:52.708
That's for you to determine.

26:54.461 --> 26:56.895
Inspire them. Be inspired.

26:56.930 --> 27:00.533
Shape the future. With you
on board there are no limits.

27:00.568 --> 27:02.218
But I'm not on board.

27:02.269 --> 27:04.770
I'm only here to help my family.

27:06.473 --> 27:09.141
What can I do to convince you?
How can we earn your trust?

27:12.696 --> 27:14.347
You can't.

27:17.451 --> 27:18.868
What happened?

27:20.654 --> 27:23.422
- Nate.
- Bye-bye.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.493
Jerk.

27:27.544 --> 27:29.662
You don't even know what you just did.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.397
I probably don't care, either.

27:31.531 --> 27:34.100
Nate, for God's sake, man, shut it.

27:36.503 --> 27:39.004
- Kyle, we can fix this.
- I don't want you to fix it.

27:39.039 --> 27:42.175
You all talk about being
family, taking care of your own.

27:42.210 --> 27:45.311
- Well, I'm going to take care of mine.
- Kyle, wait.

27:45.345 --> 27:46.612
Don't.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.463
- Aren't those Dad's old speakers?
- Yes.

28:01.497 --> 28:03.832
I need the magnets to
make the board levitate.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.634
He's gonna kill you, you know.

28:05.701 --> 28:08.003
I tried yours first, but
they weren't big enough.

28:08.038 --> 28:09.504
That's...

28:09.539 --> 28:13.325
You what? Oh, bro!

28:13.359 --> 28:16.695
We've got to talk about the
concept of personal property.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.398
I thought Latnok had
unlimited resources.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.618
- I had a setback with them.
- The competition's tomorrow.

28:23.653 --> 28:27.122
- And you clearly don't have the right materials.
- I know that.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.658
Why don't you just
levitate with the board?

28:29.692 --> 28:32.611
'Cause that would be cheating.

28:32.662 --> 28:37.082
One day we'll discuss this sporadic
morals thing you've got going.

28:41.070 --> 28:44.339
I'll have the test scores in by
tomorrow. Yeah, thanks, you too.

28:44.373 --> 28:46.758
So do I want to know why
half the kitchen appliances

28:46.759 --> 28:48.043
are on the driveway?

28:48.077 --> 28:50.211
- Science project.
- For what?

28:50.263 --> 28:52.147
For fun. You know Kyle.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.717
Loves to have fun with
science. Good times.

28:57.386 --> 29:00.889
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Mom.

29:00.923 --> 29:05.026
- Child number one is acting deceptively vague again.
- What is up with them?

29:05.061 --> 29:07.279
Oh, child number four
makes an appearance.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.781
Sarah's been sending
me these for expenses.

29:13.286 --> 29:14.819
Jessi, this is a lot of money.

29:15.037 --> 29:17.747
We need to open up a
bank account for you.

29:17.782 --> 29:20.458
Actually, I wanted to
give it to you guys.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.376
Oh, no, this is for you.

29:22.411 --> 29:24.312
This is her way of taking care of you.

29:24.347 --> 29:28.550
But she doesn't. You
do. I should pay rent.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.585
You're living here
as part of our family.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.238
None of the other kids pay
rent, so why should you?

29:33.273 --> 29:35.857
Why's everybody so
concerned about money lately?

29:38.060 --> 29:39.928
- Oh, no.
- What?

29:39.962 --> 29:42.530
The bill. You all know about the bill.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.170
OK, what's going on?

29:49.205 --> 29:51.489
I know you know about the hospital bill.

29:55.328 --> 29:57.245
I'm trying to win a science competition

29:57.413 --> 29:58.847
so I can pay your hospital bill.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.248
That's why I went to Latnok.

30:00.483 --> 30:01.983
If I win it I can
make the money you owe.

30:02.018 --> 30:03.752
How am I supposed to feel,

30:03.886 --> 30:06.488
knowing this is the price
you're paying for saving my life?

30:06.522 --> 30:08.656
I am the adult here.

30:08.691 --> 30:12.127
It is my job. It is my responsibility
to take care of all of you.

30:12.294 --> 30:14.729
But it's my fault.

30:14.764 --> 30:18.600
I was driving, and I
wasn't paying attention.

30:18.768 --> 30:20.435
I was thinking about Adam's death,

30:20.636 --> 30:24.356
and what Foss said that night,
and I made the wrong turn.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.742
I wasn't focused, and that's
when we ran off the road.

30:27.777 --> 30:29.811
Oh, Kyle.

30:29.862 --> 30:32.681
Is that what you think? That
you're responsible for this?

30:32.715 --> 30:35.684
Yes. Because it's true.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.206
So I'm finishing this project,

30:41.207 --> 30:43.158
I'm winning this competition tomorrow,

30:43.325 --> 30:45.760
and I'm fixing this
problem that I caused.

30:45.795 --> 30:50.565
And I'm sorry if you're not OK with
it, but I won't let you stop me.

30:52.301 --> 30:54.469
I won't stop you.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.604
I just don't think
it had to be this way.

31:07.683 --> 31:10.118
So I hear you're solving
the world's problems.

31:10.152 --> 31:13.405
I know Nicole's upset,
but I'm doing this.

31:13.439 --> 31:17.358
Actually, I was just wondering if
there's anything I can do to help.

32:07.841 --> 32:09.758
What do you need me?

32:21.841 --> 32:23.758
OK. Here we go.

32:33.602 --> 32:35.436
Dude, you're floating.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.492
Steady, steady.

32:41.777 --> 32:44.813
- How's it look?
- Uh, good.

32:44.947 --> 32:47.448
Magnets are running a
little hot, but they're OK.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.800
We need to prime the fields.

32:49.835 --> 32:53.588
- Kyle, you're flying.
- OK, let me go.

32:53.756 --> 32:55.173
You sure?

33:02.848 --> 33:06.000
- Looking good, Tragers.
- Steady, steady.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.362
I can't compensate!

33:17.396 --> 33:18.897
Stephen, shut it down.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.955
Are you OK?

33:31.794 --> 33:33.712
- I'm fine.
- The board isn't.

33:33.747 --> 33:35.630
- We can fix it.
- Is there time?

33:35.798 --> 33:38.132
It's not about time. It's the magnets.

33:38.167 --> 33:41.803
They're not pure enough. I was hoping
we could mimic their chemical makeup,

33:41.838 --> 33:43.805
- but we couldn't.
- Industrial magnets cost

33:43.839 --> 33:46.140
thousands of dollars.
They're not easy to come by.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.809
I know where we could get some.

33:48.010 --> 33:49.611
No. You're not asking them for anything.

33:49.929 --> 33:52.230
- I don't care what the consequences are.
- But we...

33:52.264 --> 33:53.765
Kyle, please.

33:56.051 --> 34:00.572
Then it's over. We're done.

34:14.337 --> 34:16.304
Jessi, I don't really feel like talking.

34:17.774 --> 34:19.241
I don't need to talk.

34:19.275 --> 34:22.561
I just want you to have this.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.116
- Did you get this from Cassidy?
- No.

34:28.251 --> 34:30.518
I cashed the checks that Sarah sent me.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.656
Then I tracked down an online supplier who
sold me the magnets for half the market value.

34:34.690 --> 34:36.858
- Do you think it will work?
- I don't know.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.277
But at least now we have a chance.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.431
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.298
No, we've got it. We've
got pens for everyone.

35:00.349 --> 35:02.017
I'll start final assembly.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.719
<i>And now our fourth
and fifth contestants,</i>

35:04.854 --> 35:07.472
<i>Robert Gibson and Linda Tifford.</i>

35:07.523 --> 35:09.641
- Well, you good?
- Yeah.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.282
Praying won't help you now, newbie.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.735
Look, I don't quite
know how it went down,

35:21.070 --> 35:23.822
but we can assume that whatever
happened, Nate was out of line.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.174
We've all been there.

35:27.994 --> 35:29.127
So where do you need us?

35:31.180 --> 35:32.981
Look, he's all confused.

35:33.015 --> 35:34.382
We're here to help you.

35:37.553 --> 35:40.305
- I'd like that.
- Cool.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.311
This is the main frame.
I'm gonna need those, too.

35:50.182 --> 35:54.819
<i>Now, taking the stage, our final two
contestants, Kyle Trager and Nate Harrison.</i>

35:54.820 --> 35:58.740
<i>The current leader had an elevation level
of five feet, six and one half inches,</i>

35:58.774 --> 36:01.192
<i>22.4 second duration.</i>

36:01.244 --> 36:04.996
<i>Followed closely by five feet,
three inches and 19 seconds.</i>

36:05.031 --> 36:07.749
- Lori Trager.
- Hey.

36:07.783 --> 36:09.618
You're just the girl I need to talk to.

36:09.752 --> 36:11.319
What are you doing here?

36:11.354 --> 36:14.556
Uh... It's a long story
that ends with me telling you

36:14.590 --> 36:16.691
that I've liked you
since the minute we met.

36:17.193 --> 36:20.729
Which doesn't excuse the fact that I
didn't tell you this before now. I know.

36:20.863 --> 36:22.263
Tell me what?

36:22.298 --> 36:25.901
The Latnok organization?
The one Kyle's working with?

36:25.935 --> 36:30.705
- I'm a part of it.
- You're what?

36:30.740 --> 36:33.674
- Yeah.
- No.

36:33.709 --> 36:36.227
Don't. I can't deal with this right now.

36:36.279 --> 36:38.363
We'll talk about it later.

36:44.287 --> 36:47.539
You know, when you paint a loser
gold, you still know what's inside.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.992
I'm just saying.

36:52.295 --> 36:53.461
All right. Begin.

37:10.546 --> 37:12.380
I hope that thing doesn't explode.

37:12.748 --> 37:15.483
"Experimental" and "prototype"
are just synonyms for "kaboom."

37:42.778 --> 37:44.512
Cream always rises to the top.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.848
<i>- We have a 50,000 dollar grand prize winner.
- Round one goes to you.</i>

38:22.134 --> 38:23.851
Yeah!

38:23.886 --> 38:27.322
- There doesn't have to be a round two.
- Don't be so sure about that.

38:29.859 --> 38:31.142
Whoo-hoo!

38:31.143 --> 38:33.478
- That was amazing.
- Great job.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.517
Kyle, that was so awesome.

38:47.443 --> 38:49.077
Congratulations, Kyle.

38:51.213 --> 38:52.797
<i>Everything has a price.</i>

38:52.832 --> 38:54.783
<i>I had paid mine, certain of the outcome.</i>

38:55.084 --> 38:58.586
<i>And yet, here I was, wondering
if, possibly, I had been wrong.</i>

39:02.625 --> 39:05.026
Why are you in such a good mood?

39:05.061 --> 39:07.962
Cleaning up other people's
trash is punishment.

39:07.963 --> 39:11.666
Two reasons. One, Kyle saved the day

39:11.700 --> 39:13.968
and we're not on the verge
of bankruptcy anymore.

39:15.638 --> 39:17.906
I thought we'd have to
sell the house and move,

39:17.941 --> 39:19.858
which would've sucked.

39:20.025 --> 39:25.230
And two, after we're done cleaning,
we have the apartment all to ourselves.

39:25.281 --> 39:30.585
- A swing and a miss.
- Josh, we need to talk.

39:30.619 --> 39:34.322
- Oh, no. Role reversal again?
- I wish.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.359
I have some really bad news.

39:38.394 --> 39:41.296
Hey, what's the matter?

39:45.768 --> 39:47.368
You're not sick again, are you?

39:48.037 --> 39:50.371
Please tell me you're not 'cause
I know you rely on me to be strong,

39:50.406 --> 39:52.207
and I don't know if I can handle that.

39:52.341 --> 39:55.410
It's not the cancer.

39:55.444 --> 39:57.345
It's worse.

39:58.714 --> 40:00.548
What could be worse than that?

40:00.583 --> 40:02.317
Cleveland.

40:02.451 --> 40:04.952
Excuse me?

40:04.987 --> 40:09.991
You may not be moving, but I am.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.995
My mom got a job she couldn't pass up.

40:16.432 --> 40:18.800
We move at the end of the month.

40:20.202 --> 40:21.903
You can't move.

40:22.972 --> 40:24.939
What about us?

40:29.428 --> 40:30.979
No...

40:32.314 --> 40:33.581
Oh, wow.

40:40.055 --> 40:41.940
We're closed.

40:42.057 --> 40:44.526
I'm the kind of guy who
can't take no for an answer.

40:46.395 --> 40:50.098
- Except I'm tired and I really want to go home.
- You don't look tired.

40:50.133 --> 40:52.533
But I'll get out of your hair.

40:52.568 --> 40:57.805
Slink sadly home to ponder the sad
state of life without a caffeine buzz.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.441
The pity strategy. Nice.

41:02.978 --> 41:04.879
This is for telling
me I don't look tired.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.588
You're saving my life. I'm Nate.

41:13.589 --> 41:16.658
- Amanda.
- Amanda.

41:16.693 --> 41:19.727
That's a pretty name.

41:21.313 --> 41:25.099
Come in.

41:33.943 --> 41:35.176
Did you win?

41:38.030 --> 41:39.714
Are you still mad?

41:42.084 --> 41:43.751
I don't want to be.

41:46.322 --> 41:47.755
Help me understand.

41:47.790 --> 41:50.658
You knew better, yet you did it anyway.

41:50.693 --> 41:52.493
I never wanted to hurt you.

41:52.528 --> 41:55.997
You're the most important
person to me in the world.

41:56.031 --> 41:58.032
I just...

41:58.167 --> 42:01.736
I wanted to be accepted by them,
and I let him manipulate me.

42:01.870 --> 42:05.306
- Why would you want to be involved with them at all?
- Because it...

42:05.341 --> 42:07.942
...would have been something
that you and I shared.

42:08.077 --> 42:09.711
Jessi, we share a lot of things.

42:09.745 --> 42:11.112
Not enough.

42:13.916 --> 42:16.584
I wanted more.

42:16.619 --> 42:19.487
I need to trust that you'll
always be honest with me.

42:19.522 --> 42:21.723
Otherwise, we won't share anything.

42:26.028 --> 42:28.529
In that case...

42:28.564 --> 42:30.965
...I guess you should
know Amanda came by.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.700
She did?

42:34.136 --> 42:36.437
- When?
- The other day.

42:36.472 --> 42:37.939
Why didn't you tell me?

42:37.973 --> 42:40.308
'Cause I think that she still likes you.

42:40.343 --> 42:42.043
What does that have to...

42:44.713 --> 42:46.447
Wait, she does?

42:49.118 --> 42:51.252
What does that have to do
with you not telling me?

42:54.156 --> 42:56.024
What is it?

42:58.160 --> 43:00.261
Why didn't you tell me about Amanda?

43:03.332 --> 43:05.533
Because I don't want you to be with her.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.837
I want you to be with me.
