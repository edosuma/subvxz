15:27.761 --> 15:32.430
That's when I learned
about my adoptive parents.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.202
Everything you need
to know is in that box.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.750
- Scott?

15:55.956 --> 15:59.724
- I never told you,
but I was...

15:59.726 --> 16:02.226
I was put into a group home.

16:02.228 --> 16:06.531
And then
I bounced around

16:06.533 --> 16:08.366
in foster care.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.770
- Why didn't another
family take you?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.641
- I was defective.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.444
I was filled with anger.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.382
Nobody wants a kid like that.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.721
- We're gonna get
through this, okay? Together.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.091
- You know, I...

16:34.427 --> 16:37.462
I blamed my biological mother

16:37.464 --> 16:41.099
for every bad thing
that happened to me.

16:43.636 --> 16:48.306
It was...it was so...

16:49.476 --> 16:53.678
it was so much easier
to just blame her.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.290
- Mm.

17:06.292 --> 17:07.725
Good morning.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.160
- Hey.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.530
I...I didn't wanna wake you.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.600
- Are you gonna be
at the shop late tonight?

17:15.602 --> 17:20.838
- Please cover me with
Jeremy and your parents.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.782
- Can I make
a suggestion, Scott?

17:30.784 --> 17:34.485
Your grandmother's only
an hour away from here.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.622
Why don't you try and connect
with her and your mother today?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.158
- I don't...
I don't think so.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.325
- It might help.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.429
- It's not gonna
change anything.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.565
- Aren't you
a little bit curious?

17:50.136 --> 17:52.637
- I got all
the information I need.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.740
- Is there something
you're not telling me?

we chipped in

18:23.503 --> 18:24.535
and we got Jeremy
a little something,

18:24.537 --> 18:25.837
a little present for him.

have to do that.

- Ah.

something nice, though.

He...he's five, and she looks

five about two months ago.

a beautiful daughter.

Just like her mother.

for that, but Erica's adopted.

- Um...did you know?

20:39.639 --> 20:43.107
- Do you mean did we know
that she had Down's syndrome?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.176
Yes, we did.

others might not want.

44:46.418 --> 44:48.418
- I don't know how
I could have

44:48.420 --> 44:50.319
any kind of
relationship with her.

44:50.321 --> 44:55.124
- Why not? She's the sweetest
person I've ever met.

44:55.126 --> 44:58.528
Plus she desperately
wants to meet you someday.

44:58.530 --> 45:01.831
- I don't think that can happen.

45:01.833 --> 45:06.736
You know, we need
to put all this behind us

45:06.738 --> 45:09.238
and just move forward.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.241
- I actually wanna
visit her again.

45:13.645 --> 45:15.545
- What? Why?

45:15.547 --> 45:18.414
- Because she's family, Scott.

45:18.416 --> 45:21.451
Plus I think it
would be good for Jeremy

45:21.453 --> 45:23.453
to meet his grandmother someday.

45:23.455 --> 45:28.291
And you... you need
to make peace with the past.

45:30.729 --> 45:32.829
- You know, it's like...

45:34.132 --> 45:36.399
- Come visit with me.

45:37.702 --> 45:39.402
- Yeah, I...

45:39.404 --> 45:40.670
I have an early morning.

45:40.672 --> 45:42.505
I need...I need
to get some rest.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.340
- Just think about it, Scott.

45:51.816 --> 45:54.016
You wanna take a couple
more bites for me?

45:55.520 --> 45:56.886
Yeah, come on.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.088
- You, uh...
You should have woke me.

45:59.090 --> 46:02.191
- After the way you were
tossing and turning last night,

46:02.193 --> 46:04.293
I thought you could
use a little sleep.

46:04.295 --> 46:06.129
- Mm.
- Daddy, guess what?

46:06.131 --> 46:07.296
- What?

46:07.298 --> 46:09.832
- I get to spend the day
with Granny and Papa.

46:09.834 --> 46:12.935
- What? Oh, man, with Mommy?

46:12.937 --> 46:16.105
- Actually, Mommy has
other things to do.

46:16.941 --> 46:19.075
- What...what kinda things?

46:20.178 --> 46:22.545
- Mm.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.214
- Karen, please.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.452
- You have a good day, sweetie.

46:30.989 --> 46:32.555
- I will, Mommy.

46:34.225 --> 46:37.160
- I have to do this.
We'll talk later, okay?

46:42.333 --> 46:44.867
- Is Mommy okay?

46:44.869 --> 46:46.869
- I think so, buddy.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.549
- Okay, so when we start again,

46:59.551 --> 47:02.585
we're gonna start at
"Jingle Bells," okay?

47:05.990 --> 47:08.724
Carol, we're in the
middle of a rehearsal.

47:08.726 --> 47:10.626
Carol?

47:12.263 --> 47:13.863
When we perform in public,

47:13.865 --> 47:16.032
you can't rush into the crowd
to give your big hugs

47:16.034 --> 47:18.467
to audience members.

47:18.469 --> 47:20.236
Carol?

47:22.006 --> 47:24.407
Your friend can
pull up a chair and join us.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.143
[ giggles ]

47:30.815 --> 47:32.281
- Bells up.

[ plays  "Jingle Bells" ]

47:44.729 --> 47:47.496
- Karen.

47:47.498 --> 47:50.233
I wasn't sure if
we would see you again.

47:50.235 --> 47:53.069
- Hi, Lillian.
I wasn't sure either.

47:55.039 --> 47:57.039
I got my paperwork filled out.

47:57.041 --> 48:02.612
- Oh. Well, that's a
good place to start.

48:02.614 --> 48:05.848
What do you want to accomplish?

48:05.850 --> 48:07.516
- I wanna help.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.255
- Mm.

48:12.257 --> 48:13.656
You know, I have to mention

48:13.658 --> 48:17.260
that you caused a bit
of trouble yesterday.

48:17.262 --> 48:19.762
Volunteers are
not typically allowed

48:19.764 --> 48:22.098
in our residents' apartments.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.268
- I am so sorry.
I understand completely.

48:25.270 --> 48:28.337
- Mm. Well, I'm gonna
check your references.

48:28.339 --> 48:29.972
Then we can talk
about what areas

48:29.974 --> 48:32.174
you might be able to help in.

48:32.176 --> 48:34.844
- I actually was wondering
if I could start

48:34.846 --> 48:36.646
one-on-one with Carol.

48:37.982 --> 48:40.549
- Well, we'll see.

48:41.552 --> 48:43.119
- Okay.
- Yeah.

48:50.261 --> 48:53.996
- Hi, it's Lillian.

48:53.998 --> 48:56.232
Karen Johnson is back.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.435
- Do you have the paperwork?

48:59.437 --> 49:02.305
All right, let's start
with her address.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.006
Give that to me, please.

49:04.842 --> 49:07.376
- It is 600 Bender Lane.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.645
- Okay.

49:09.647 --> 49:11.580
Now what I want you to do
is go out and discretely

49:11.582 --> 49:15.318
find her car and write down
her license number.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.687
- All right, and what now?

49:17.689 --> 49:21.524
- Put her on as a volunteer,
but keep a close watch on her.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.362
- Okay.

49:29.500 --> 49:33.069
- Good work, everyone.
Good job, let's clean up.

49:34.272 --> 49:36.072
- You're all set.
- Great.

49:36.074 --> 49:37.807
- You know, there are
many clients here

49:37.809 --> 49:42.244
who could really use
the time you're offering.

49:42.246 --> 49:44.814
- Well, you know,
I'd like to start with Carol,

49:44.816 --> 49:46.749
and then see how it goes.

49:48.953 --> 49:50.720
- I think she'd like that.

49:50.722 --> 49:53.422
She could use some assistance
with her handwriting.

49:54.525 --> 49:55.558
- Great.

49:59.297 --> 50:03.666
- Okay, the rules are you
work here in the center.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.502
There's no visiting
in your apartment,

50:06.504 --> 50:08.604
Remember, we had that talk.

50:08.606 --> 50:10.973
- Yeah, yeah.

50:10.975 --> 50:12.975
- Excuse me?

50:12.977 --> 50:14.243
- I'm sorry.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.845
- That's better.

50:15.847 --> 50:18.881
All right. Take this.

50:18.883 --> 50:21.150
- Great.
- Self-explanatory.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.651
Have fun.

50:22.653 --> 50:25.321
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

50:27.558 --> 50:32.661
- Okay, it says, "Think
of as many names of fruit,

50:32.663 --> 50:35.598
and write down as many
as you can think of."

50:40.438 --> 50:42.338
Oh, you have nice handwriting.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.174
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:47.545 --> 50:50.112
How about bananas?
- Ew.

50:52.417 --> 50:54.116
- Of course you don't.

50:54.118 --> 50:56.318
I love bananas.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.187
- I'm bored.

50:58.189 --> 50:59.889
- Oh, um...

50:59.891 --> 51:02.124
will Lillian check your work?

51:02.126 --> 51:03.526
- Yes.

51:03.528 --> 51:07.463
- Okay, well,
let's write one more down.

51:15.873 --> 51:17.606
You know, I have an idea.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.941
- Hm?

51:18.943 --> 51:21.043
- How about we write a letter?

51:21.045 --> 51:22.144
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

51:22.146 --> 51:23.412
Okay.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.414
Let's put this
over here for now.

51:28.653 --> 51:31.187
Who would you like
to write a letter to?

51:32.523 --> 51:34.323
- My son.

51:34.325 --> 51:35.524
- Are you sure?

51:35.526 --> 51:37.460
Okay.
- This is for him.

51:37.462 --> 51:40.596
- Okay. Let's start.

51:45.269 --> 51:48.637
- "My son is..."

51:51.242 --> 51:53.242
- What would you like
to say to your son?

51:55.246 --> 51:57.680
What would you like to say
to your baby boy?

51:59.484 --> 52:02.818
- I play the bells.
- You play...

52:02.820 --> 52:05.921
- Bells at church.

52:09.327 --> 52:12.261
- And what do you dream of?

52:13.331 --> 52:16.465
- I dream of going to Vegas.

52:20.338 --> 52:24.473
"I dream of you."

52:24.475 --> 52:29.478
"I dream of you watching."

52:38.156 --> 52:41.390
- Yeah. Him.

52:41.392 --> 52:43.359
- I want him to come home.

52:43.361 --> 52:44.693
- Yeah, you do.

52:47.565 --> 52:50.499
He's gonna come home, yeah.

53:05.183 --> 53:08.617
- Hey, buddy,

53:08.619 --> 53:11.020
can you do your
daddy a favor

53:11.022 --> 53:14.623
and go upstairs and
start getting ready for bed?

53:14.625 --> 53:16.525
I'll be there in a minute.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.627
- But it's early.

53:18.629 --> 53:21.830
- Do as Daddy says, okay?
Come on.

53:29.006 --> 53:31.473
What do you think you're doing?

53:31.475 --> 53:34.743
I need you to let go.

53:34.745 --> 53:38.647
- I can't, Scott.
I'm a mother.

53:38.649 --> 53:41.317
If Jeremy was taken
from me at birth,

53:42.753 --> 53:45.454
I can only imagine
the unbearable pain

53:45.456 --> 53:48.057
that would cause.

53:48.059 --> 53:50.159
- That's not my fault.

53:50.161 --> 53:51.694
- And nobody said that.

53:53.931 --> 53:55.064
You know, I...

53:56.167 --> 53:57.833
I just can't understand.

53:57.835 --> 54:00.970
You spent all
of this time

54:00.972 --> 54:02.905
trying to find your
biological mother,

54:02.907 --> 54:04.607
and now you just
wanna forget about it.

54:04.609 --> 54:07.543
- Because I can't hate
her anymore for it.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.547
- Scott...

54:25.563 --> 54:28.597
Morning.
- Morning.

54:28.599 --> 54:31.567
- Morning, sweetie.
- Good morning.

54:37.708 --> 54:41.710
- This is a letter written
from Carol to you.

54:41.712 --> 54:45.114
I think you should read it.
It might help you.

54:45.116 --> 54:46.915
- Who's Carol?

54:46.917 --> 54:52.121
- Oh, well, she's a new friend
of Mommy's, sweetie.

54:52.123 --> 54:54.623
[ knocking ]

54:54.625 --> 54:56.759
- You know, I gotta...
I gotta get that.

55:03.167 --> 55:04.900
Hi, can I help you?

55:04.902 --> 55:07.436
- You must be Scott.

55:07.438 --> 55:10.472
- Oh, this is a surprise.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.508
- Hello, Mrs. Johnson.

55:12.510 --> 55:15.177
- Do you personally
visit all new volunteers?

55:15.179 --> 55:17.513
- No.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.982
May I come in?

55:19.984 --> 55:21.717
- Please.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.754
- Who is that?

55:25.756 --> 55:29.591
- Helen Harris,
your biological grandmother.

55:30.695 --> 55:34.363
- Okay.
Here's some tea for you.

55:34.365 --> 55:35.364
- Thank you.

55:35.366 --> 55:37.066
- You're welcome.

55:37.068 --> 55:39.968
- I think it's best if we put
everything out in the open.

55:41.739 --> 55:43.605
- I take it you know who we are.

55:43.607 --> 55:46.308
- I do. I do.

55:46.310 --> 55:48.444
And I'm sure you
have many reasons

55:48.446 --> 55:50.612
for seeking my daughter out.

55:50.614 --> 55:52.448
- Oh, I don't think it's
that uncommon

55:52.450 --> 55:54.450
for an adopted child
to seek out

55:54.452 --> 55:56.719
his or her own
biological parents.

55:56.721 --> 56:00.889
- I suppose not, but
it's not lost on me that

56:00.891 --> 56:04.093
it's you visiting my daughter,
not your husband.

56:04.095 --> 56:08.163
- I understand your concern
for Carol's wellbeing, I do.

56:08.165 --> 56:11.433
- Well, that's exactly
why I'm here.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.870
I want you to stop visiting her.

56:14.872 --> 56:17.506
It's just too disruptive
to her life.

56:17.508 --> 56:19.875
- No, it's not.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.610
- Well, it...

56:21.612 --> 56:25.781
it will be if she finds
out who your husband is.

56:25.783 --> 56:28.917
- Well, you're wrong.
This is what Carol wants.

56:28.919 --> 56:30.152
- Karen, please.

56:30.154 --> 56:31.553
- Oh, really?

56:31.555 --> 56:33.122
You've had two visits
with my daughter.

56:33.124 --> 56:35.391
Suddenly you're an expert
on her life?

56:35.393 --> 56:36.725
- Well, she misses her son.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.527
That's not difficult
to understand.

56:38.529 --> 56:40.229
She thinks about him every day.

56:40.231 --> 56:44.099
- I think it's just better
if the past remains the past.

56:44.101 --> 56:45.934
- There isn't a day
that goes by

56:45.936 --> 56:48.704
that she doesn't
not wanna see Scott.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.674
- Well, that's
not going to happen.

56:54.378 --> 56:58.013
- I think if we work together,
we can make it happen.

56:58.015 --> 57:00.716
- I know what's
best for my daughter.

57:00.718 --> 57:02.084
- You're wrong.

57:02.086 --> 57:04.753
- I think we should
honor her wishes.

57:07.525 --> 57:09.758
No, not now.
Karen, put it away.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.293
- I have to do this.

57:11.295 --> 57:14.730
I helped Carol at the center
with her handwriting.

57:14.732 --> 57:18.100
And this is a letter
she wrote to Scott.

57:18.102 --> 57:20.169
"I miss you every day.

"Please don't be mad at my mommy
for making you go away.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.583
I hated her for doing that."

57:34.585 --> 57:36.051
- Oh, that's enough.

57:36.053 --> 57:38.854
- "I stopped talking
to her for a very long time,

57:38.856 --> 57:41.323
I hated her so much."

57:41.325 --> 57:44.793
- That's enough.
That's just enough.

57:52.236 --> 57:54.236
- "I forgive her now."

57:55.306 --> 57:58.607
[ sighs ]

58:02.746 --> 58:07.149
- That was just an awful time.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.855
I made so many mistakes,

58:12.857 --> 58:15.123
I know that.
But I...

58:16.961 --> 58:19.161
I can't go
through that again,

58:19.163 --> 58:22.231
and I don't want to put
her through that again.

58:29.206 --> 58:33.108
- Karen and I will
respect your wishes.

58:33.110 --> 58:39.114
Neither of us will go to the
center or visit Carol again.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.251
- Thank you.

58:42.253 --> 58:46.488
It truly...
truly is for the best.

58:46.490 --> 58:48.257
- Really?

Granny and Papa

the others for home.
