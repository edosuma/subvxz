01:12.663 --> 01:15.900
This is the
house I grew up in.

01:19.369 --> 01:22.404
That's our sailboat
we never use.

01:22.406 --> 01:25.309
My dad calls it
the Spirit Breaker.

01:31.881 --> 01:34.416
That's Flake's house.

01:34.418 --> 01:36.086
He's my best friend.

01:38.255 --> 01:41.756
That's where I broke my
wrist when I was eight.

01:41.758 --> 01:45.662
And the pole Flake and
I carved our names into.

01:48.332 --> 01:50.735
This is our school.

01:54.939 --> 01:58.109
That's my locker I
can never get open.

01:59.609 --> 02:02.977
I lay in bed at night terrorized
by thoughts of this place

02:02.979 --> 02:04.915
to where I can't sleep.

02:05.848 --> 02:07.215
And if I ever do get to sleep,

02:07.217 --> 02:09.354
I just have nightmares about it.

02:10.553 --> 02:13.624
Everyone's in a group or
wants to be in a group.

02:13.626 --> 02:15.389
It's a joke.

02:15.391 --> 02:16.991
This place, and everyone in it,

02:16.993 --> 02:19.527
is a big shit pile
floating downstream.

02:19.529 --> 02:20.829
And all the way at the bottom,

02:20.831 --> 02:23.164
below the kids with
missing jaws and shit,

02:23.166 --> 02:25.334
there's me and Flake.

02:25.336 --> 02:27.202
Ours is a group of two.

03:18.421 --> 03:20.021
We know it's
only the first day of school,

03:20.023 --> 03:23.025
but we want to encourage everyone
to meet in the quad today

03:23.027 --> 03:25.960
where you can sign up
for chess club, art club,

03:25.962 --> 03:29.830
thespian club, yearbook
club, drama club,

03:29.832 --> 03:31.568
video journalism club...

03:52.156 --> 03:54.391
Edwin, where's your book?

03:55.325 --> 03:56.758
In my locker.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.495
Well, what good is
it doing you in there?

04:00.497 --> 04:02.166
Sometimes I wonder.

04:03.099 --> 04:04.966
Did you hear me?

04:04.968 --> 04:07.538
What's it doing in your locker?

04:09.573 --> 04:10.972
Well, do you want to
explain to the principal

04:10.974 --> 04:12.973
why it's there?

04:12.975 --> 04:14.408
He can't
get his locker open.

04:16.144 --> 04:16.980
Shh.

04:18.281 --> 04:19.416
Is that true?

04:21.918 --> 04:23.385
Is that really true?

04:23.387 --> 04:24.555
Oh, fuck me.

04:32.296 --> 04:36.467
So, Ms. Meier says you're
not to come back into her class

04:38.135 --> 04:42.307
until you're ready to start
acting like a human being.

04:43.173 --> 04:44.909
Do you know when that'll be?

04:49.546 --> 04:52.179
You want to tell me
what happened today?

04:52.181 --> 04:54.851
I couldn't get my locker open.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.886
You couldn't get
your locker open?

04:58.888 --> 05:01.289
Why does everyone
repeat what I say?

05:01.291 --> 05:03.825
Okay, and I
suppose you found it appropriate

05:03.827 --> 05:06.695
to use foul language
in her class

05:06.697 --> 05:08.028
'cause you couldn't
get your locker open?

05:08.030 --> 05:08.864
Is that right?

05:08.866 --> 05:10.534
You suppose right.

05:12.936 --> 05:17.108
All right, just tell your
parents I'm gonna be in touch.

05:21.611 --> 05:22.847
Do you hear me?

05:24.580 --> 05:26.381
I may keep it a surprise.

05:26.383 --> 05:27.484
Oh, my god.

05:28.851 --> 05:30.352
Kids like you used to
get their butts kicked

05:30.354 --> 05:31.755
when I was a kid.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.957
They still do.

05:35.892 --> 05:37.124
All right.

05:37.126 --> 05:39.896
Can we see less of
each other, please?

05:41.265 --> 05:44.265
My mom checks the summer
reading thing that we had to do

05:44.267 --> 05:45.200
and she looks over and she says,

05:45.202 --> 05:46.434
"Oh, this isn't good enough".

05:46.436 --> 05:47.869
So, she's making me
redo the entire thing

05:47.871 --> 05:49.270
before we have to
hand it in tomorrow.

05:49.272 --> 05:50.905
It's so fucking stupid.

05:50.907 --> 05:52.873
She's always on
my case about it.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.609
She just won't shut up for
the rest of the period.

05:54.611 --> 05:57.714
And then, in the hallway
after class she's like...

06:00.717 --> 06:01.519
Ball.

06:08.825 --> 06:10.424
Come on.

06:10.426 --> 06:11.595
What the fuck?

06:15.498 --> 06:16.765
What's up now, bitch?

06:16.767 --> 06:18.299
Get off me.

06:18.301 --> 06:19.770
Get off him.

06:20.370 --> 06:20.972
Oh, fuck!

06:21.839 --> 06:24.939
Think you're funny now?

06:24.941 --> 06:27.577
Where you going?
Where you going?

06:29.078 --> 06:30.111
What are you gonna do?

06:30.113 --> 06:30.946
Look at you.

06:30.948 --> 06:31.780
Get off of me.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.049
Get off.

06:33.916 --> 06:34.715
You're such a bitch.

06:34.717 --> 06:35.383
Fuck you.

06:35.385 --> 06:36.350
Fuck me?

06:36.352 --> 06:37.187
- Okay.
- Fuck you.

06:39.089 --> 06:40.155
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:40.157 --> 06:41.857
Knock it off!

06:41.859 --> 06:43.458
Hey, knock it off!

06:43.460 --> 06:44.458
I'm gonna kill you.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.760
What are you gonna do?

06:45.762 --> 06:48.429
I said knock
it off right now!

06:48.431 --> 06:49.931
Hey, hey, knock it off.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.499
Knock it off. Get off him.

06:51.501 --> 06:53.200
Get off him!

06:53.202 --> 06:54.970
What is wrong with you?

06:54.972 --> 06:55.806
Go.

07:03.012 --> 07:04.044
Hey, hey kid.

07:04.046 --> 07:05.847
You all right?

07:07.116 --> 07:10.585
I want everybody off
the field right now.

07:10.587 --> 07:11.419
Flake, you okay?

07:11.421 --> 07:13.089
Fuck you.

07:16.493 --> 07:17.424
Go.

07:17.426 --> 07:18.426
I'll talk to you in a minute.

07:18.428 --> 07:19.262
Go.

07:33.876 --> 07:35.876
Was Roddy involved?

07:35.878 --> 07:37.278
No, not this time.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.313
Just the last
time then, right?

07:39.315 --> 07:41.415
He gets blamed for
a lot of stuff he doesn't do.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.816
I know.

07:42.818 --> 07:46.424
He's such a misunderstood
figure, isn't he?

07:47.291 --> 07:48.222
How about a new friend, pal?

07:48.224 --> 07:50.157
You ever think about that?

07:50.159 --> 07:51.825
Maybe a friend that you
haven't seen every single day

07:51.827 --> 07:53.193
since you were five.

07:53.195 --> 07:54.364
Tim.

07:55.532 --> 07:57.064
You know, you're
grounded for a week.

07:57.066 --> 07:58.265
You get detention,
you get grounded.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.234
Those are the rules.

08:00.236 --> 08:01.606
Hey, you hear me?

08:03.073 --> 08:04.239
Edwin?

08:04.241 --> 08:06.207
No more ice cream for me.

08:06.209 --> 08:08.410
Ooh, you want to make it two?

08:08.412 --> 08:09.677
I don't care.

08:09.679 --> 08:10.611
Hey.

08:10.613 --> 08:12.616
Edwin, come on.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.987
What'd you teach today?

08:19.989 --> 08:21.157
Macro.

08:22.058 --> 08:23.191
Was it fun?

08:23.193 --> 08:24.025
Yeah, I had fun.

08:24.027 --> 08:24.859
I like Macro.

08:24.861 --> 08:25.693
I don't know.

08:25.695 --> 08:26.527
I don't know what to do.

08:26.529 --> 08:27.565
Maybe a new school?

08:27.567 --> 08:29.631
I'm not going
to a private school.

08:29.633 --> 08:30.864
You got that right.

08:30.866 --> 08:32.066
Yeah
well somewhere new

08:32.068 --> 08:33.000
wouldn't be the
worst thing for you.

08:33.001 --> 08:34.034
Is that good, Gus?

08:35.606 --> 08:37.037
Hey, take
a napkin, please.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.907
I think Gus is gonna
turn out to be normal.

08:39.909 --> 08:42.509
Edwin, please don't say that.

08:42.510 --> 08:43.979
He is.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.479
You're not abnormal.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.248
Well, let's not rush
to judgment on that.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.450
Honey.

08:49.452 --> 08:50.518
What, I can't kid
around with him?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.487
It's not funny.

08:52.489 --> 08:53.455
You're fine.

08:53.457 --> 08:54.288
Your mother's right.

08:54.290 --> 08:55.123
You're not abnormal.

08:55.125 --> 08:55.956
I'm not?

08:55.958 --> 08:56.891
Speaking of.

08:56.893 --> 08:57.825
No, you're not.

08:57.827 --> 08:58.893
What, are you possessed?

08:58.895 --> 08:59.728
Oh, Gus.

08:59.730 --> 09:00.798
Please, just.

09:01.898 --> 09:04.365
I got something on my butt.

09:06.303 --> 09:07.569
Wow.

09:07.571 --> 09:08.637
Well, that came
out of left field.

09:08.639 --> 09:09.771
What would that be?

09:09.773 --> 09:11.038
- Want to see?
- No.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.040
Oh, my God.

09:12.042 --> 09:13.474
Maybe later.

09:13.476 --> 09:14.911
That's the normal
you're aspiring to.

09:25.989 --> 09:27.656
What are they watching?

09:27.658 --> 09:28.491
TV.

09:32.395 --> 09:36.567
Are there any other kids
at school who don't watch TV?

09:37.299 --> 09:38.700
You mean, besides me?

09:38.702 --> 09:41.038
Oh, besides you and Roddy.

09:42.606 --> 09:45.440
Not that I can think of.

09:45.442 --> 09:49.076
Well, don't kids talk
about shows and stuff

09:49.078 --> 09:51.345
that are on all the time?

09:51.347 --> 09:52.949
All the time.

09:54.918 --> 09:58.522
What about, um, social media?

09:59.856 --> 10:01.125
Social media?

10:02.025 --> 10:03.490
Okay, you know what I mean.

10:03.492 --> 10:05.926
Facebook, Instagram, whatever.

10:05.928 --> 10:09.163
You and Roddy don't
do any of that stuff.

10:09.165 --> 10:10.330
Don't the other kids?

10:10.332 --> 10:11.836
Yeah, of course.

10:14.638 --> 10:17.571
So don't you feel left out?

10:17.573 --> 10:18.842
All the time.

10:48.572 --> 10:50.338
Hello?

10:50.340 --> 10:53.511
Welcome to Target World.

10:54.276 --> 10:55.844
What?

10:55.846 --> 10:57.545
Who is this?

10:57.547 --> 10:59.817
Emperor Samatar.

11:00.717 --> 11:01.582
Oh, god.

11:01.584 --> 11:02.816
It's you again.

11:02.818 --> 11:04.418
What do you got
for me this time?

11:06.523 --> 11:08.325
Oh, God.

11:09.391 --> 11:10.226
Okay.

11:17.266 --> 11:18.101
Hello?

11:18.968 --> 11:21.402
So, that's it?

11:21.404 --> 11:22.537
All right, pal.

12:22.933 --> 12:24.065
Asshole.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.135
No talking.

12:30.506 --> 12:31.773
Asshole.

12:31.775 --> 12:33.611
What did I just say?

12:35.645 --> 12:37.644
What is it, Mr. Sfikas?

12:37.646 --> 12:38.580
He's swearing at me.

12:38.582 --> 12:39.913
Can you tell him to stop?

12:39.915 --> 12:41.816
Leave him
alone, Mr. Hanratty.

12:41.818 --> 12:43.250
He keeps putting his
hand down his pants

12:43.252 --> 12:45.619
and doing something
with himself.

12:45.621 --> 12:46.454
It's gross.

12:46.456 --> 12:47.989
The whole desk moves.

12:49.558 --> 12:51.594
Just
both of you be quiet.

13:02.838 --> 13:03.671
18-15.

13:03.673 --> 13:04.504
My ball.

13:04.506 --> 13:05.342
Come on.

13:07.776 --> 13:08.743
Asshole.

13:08.745 --> 13:10.210
Fuckwad.

13:10.212 --> 13:12.312
You're
such an asshole.

13:12.314 --> 13:13.681
You're such a fuckwad.

13:13.683 --> 13:14.585
Oh, okay.

13:15.619 --> 13:17.053
Nice comeback, man.

13:22.726 --> 13:24.528
You're so bad at this.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.169
Fuck you, man.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.838
It's your serve.

13:36.840 --> 13:37.672
20-16.

13:37.674 --> 13:38.576
Game point.

13:54.491 --> 13:55.826
I am victorious.

13:57.226 --> 13:59.927
Sorry to see that game end.

13:59.929 --> 14:01.995
Thank you, Mrs. Pengue.

14:01.997 --> 14:04.197
Thank you very much.

14:04.199 --> 14:05.365
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

14:05.367 --> 14:07.567
thank you, thank you, thank you.

14:07.569 --> 14:08.805
Goodbye, folks.

14:10.273 --> 14:11.609
Good to be here.

14:19.448 --> 14:20.681
Help me.

14:20.683 --> 14:22.716
Yes.

14:22.718 --> 14:24.418
So, guess
who I got a call from

14:24.420 --> 14:25.585
a little bit ago?

14:25.587 --> 14:27.187
Uh, the Pope.

14:27.189 --> 14:28.022
No.

14:28.024 --> 14:28.922
Who?

14:28.924 --> 14:30.825
Mrs. Pengue.

14:30.827 --> 14:32.026
Uh-huh.

14:32.028 --> 14:34.595
Yeah, she was
surprisingly upset.

14:34.597 --> 14:38.769
Said she found the most
interesting thing on her table.

14:40.669 --> 14:41.502
What'd she find?

14:42.338 --> 14:43.437
Hey, Gus.

14:43.439 --> 14:44.638
Knock it off.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.974
You don't know
anything about this?

14:45.976 --> 14:47.207
No.

14:47.209 --> 14:48.142
Hey, pal. Can
you get me a beer?

14:48.978 --> 14:49.911
Aw, listen to him sigh.

14:49.913 --> 14:52.515
I know, he lives to serve us.

14:53.382 --> 14:54.282
You don't have to do that.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.516
Come on.

14:55.518 --> 14:56.450
What's your
mother talking about?

14:56.452 --> 14:57.685
I don't know.

14:57.687 --> 14:59.119
Well, why don't
you tell your father

14:59.121 --> 15:01.822
what Mrs. Pengue found
on her picnic table.

15:01.824 --> 15:04.224
I don't know what anyone
found on their picnic table.

15:04.226 --> 15:05.158
Thank you.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.494
Oh, yeah, you don't?

15:06.496 --> 15:07.427
No.

15:07.429 --> 15:08.262
I don't want basghetti.

15:08.264 --> 15:09.497
I want pizza.

15:09.499 --> 15:11.365
A severed head?

15:11.367 --> 15:12.499
A dying weasel?

15:12.501 --> 15:13.801
I don't know.

15:13.803 --> 15:15.239
What'd she find?

15:16.239 --> 15:17.705
All right.

15:17.707 --> 15:21.879
Well, it was a pile of human

15:22.345 --> 15:23.478
poop.

15:25.048 --> 15:26.346
What?

15:27.217 --> 15:28.349
Okay, that's great.

15:28.351 --> 15:29.383
He was going like this.

15:29.385 --> 15:30.384
No, encourage him.

15:30.386 --> 15:31.451
Great.

15:31.453 --> 15:33.253
How did she know it was human?

15:33.255 --> 15:34.187
Sorry.

15:34.189 --> 15:35.123
So, you think I did it?

15:35.125 --> 15:35.956
Yeah.

15:35.958 --> 15:36.891
You or Roddy.

15:36.893 --> 15:38.393
Because I didn't do anything.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.128
I don't need you all
worked up right now.

15:41.130 --> 15:43.196
I'm just asking you a question.

15:43.198 --> 15:45.099
I want pizza.

15:45.101 --> 15:46.200
Well, we're
not having pizza.

15:46.202 --> 15:47.167
Have a bite, please.

15:47.169 --> 15:48.436
Come on.

15:48.438 --> 15:50.039
You take a dump
on Pengue's table?

15:50.506 --> 15:51.140
No.

15:52.509 --> 15:55.209
Did Roddy, or Flake, whatever
he's going by these days?

15:55.211 --> 15:56.411
No.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.244
Who did?

15:57.246 --> 15:58.178
I don't know.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.113
All right, come on.

15:59.115 --> 16:00.047
I didn't even go in her yard.

16:00.049 --> 16:01.048
I don't know who did it, okay?

16:01.050 --> 16:01.849
How did it get there?

16:01.851 --> 16:02.783
I don't...

16:02.785 --> 16:04.018
One of you guys did it.

16:04.020 --> 16:04.685
I don't know
what you want me to say.

16:04.687 --> 16:05.353
Don't lie.

16:05.355 --> 16:06.186
I'm not lying.

16:06.188 --> 16:07.422
Hey, relax, all right?

16:07.424 --> 16:08.255
We're just talking about this.

16:08.257 --> 16:09.891
Just tell us.

16:09.893 --> 16:11.158
I didn't do anything.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.093
What is the matter?

16:12.095 --> 16:12.893
What do you want from me?

16:12.895 --> 16:14.162
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

16:14.164 --> 16:15.028
Hey!

16:15.030 --> 16:16.467
Edwin, come back!

16:25.375 --> 16:26.840
What's the matter with him?

16:26.842 --> 16:28.611
I don't know.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.172
You better
be there tomorrow.

17:29.973 --> 17:30.937
Okay, we'll call you.

17:30.939 --> 17:31.775
Thanks.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.399
Come on, seriously.

17:59.401 --> 18:00.901
Have you even kissed a girl?

18:00.903 --> 18:03.271
Yeah, do you
even know what a clit is?

18:03.273 --> 18:04.205
I think he does.

18:04.207 --> 18:05.639
You think he does?

18:05.641 --> 18:06.840
Yeah.

18:06.842 --> 18:08.642
Do you know how
many holes a girl has?

18:08.644 --> 18:09.776
Yeah.

18:09.778 --> 18:11.047
You do?

18:12.215 --> 18:13.481
Yeah.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.349
So, how many?

18:15.351 --> 18:16.917
Fuck off.

18:16.919 --> 18:17.851
He doesn't know.

18:17.853 --> 18:18.785
I think he does.

18:18.787 --> 18:20.221
I think he's got 'em himself.

18:20.223 --> 18:21.222
Three.

18:21.224 --> 18:22.223
Where are they?

18:22.225 --> 18:23.424
He said three.

18:23.426 --> 18:25.329
Where are they?

18:26.595 --> 18:29.866
One in the front
and one in the back.

18:31.266 --> 18:32.101
And?

18:33.937 --> 18:35.869
He doesn't know shit.

18:35.871 --> 18:38.138
Yeah, he knows
where his mom's holes are.

18:38.140 --> 18:41.678
Can you believe this shit?

18:48.584 --> 18:51.252
Dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima.

18:51.254 --> 18:53.321
That bomb has more power

18:53.323 --> 18:56.692
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

19:00.897 --> 19:02.163
So, I had this idea.

19:02.165 --> 19:04.165
I lifted some stuff
from Pengue's garage

19:04.167 --> 19:06.032
when I took that
shit on her table.

19:06.034 --> 19:07.702
Nice move, by the way.

19:07.704 --> 19:09.136
The table.

19:09.138 --> 19:10.170
What, did you get in trouble?

19:10.172 --> 19:11.171
Of course I got in trouble.

19:11.173 --> 19:12.608
What'd you think?

19:14.076 --> 19:16.310
That's awesome.

19:16.312 --> 19:17.978
So, I got this
bug powder, right?

19:17.980 --> 19:18.814
Roten...

19:20.283 --> 19:21.349
I don't know what it's called.

19:21.351 --> 19:23.317
Roten something.

19:23.319 --> 19:25.619
It's supposed to be
like super toxic.

19:25.621 --> 19:26.853
Oh, great.

19:26.855 --> 19:29.290
So now I'm gonna
get shit for that.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.391
You're not gonna get shit
for shit, Mr. Fearless.

19:31.393 --> 19:33.360
I took a pound from
like a 20 pound bag.

19:33.362 --> 19:35.332
Roddy, get down here!

19:38.200 --> 19:39.035
Roddy!

19:44.573 --> 19:46.706
What do you want?

19:46.708 --> 19:48.711
I want
you to get down here.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.880
It was
to spare the Japanese people

19:53.882 --> 19:55.782
from utter destruction

19:55.784 --> 19:59.957
that the ultimatum of July the
26th was issued at Potsdam.

20:01.157 --> 20:05.329
Their leaders promptly
rejected that ultimatum.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.727
What
did your father want?

20:07.729 --> 20:08.396
He wanted
to put his dick in me.

20:09.966 --> 20:10.669
What?!

20:15.037 --> 20:16.603
I'm all alone here.

20:16.605 --> 20:18.441
I feel like I'm living alone.

20:20.942 --> 20:22.845
So, what's your idea?

20:30.453 --> 20:32.852
Think the bug powder will
really get people sick?

20:32.854 --> 20:34.524
We'll see.

20:37.893 --> 20:39.159
Shit.

20:39.161 --> 20:40.828
Well, how do we get the
powder into the vents?

20:40.830 --> 20:41.661
Oh my god, dude.

20:41.663 --> 20:42.629
Shut up.

20:42.631 --> 20:44.534
Just trust me, it'll work.

20:50.505 --> 20:52.807
Dude, that's fucked.

20:52.809 --> 20:55.612
The pan's not gonna
fit through there.

21:01.217 --> 21:04.551
Why don't we pour
some in the baggie

21:04.553 --> 21:07.291
and leave the
baggie open inside?

21:59.108 --> 22:01.108
Where are your parents?

22:01.110 --> 22:02.877
Movies, dinner, Canada.

22:02.879 --> 22:03.980
I don't know.

22:12.755 --> 22:15.525
Do you want to check
out my dad's guns?

22:18.361 --> 22:20.528
What kind's he got?

22:20.530 --> 22:22.096
Guns.

22:22.098 --> 22:23.265
More than one.

22:49.624 --> 22:51.591
This one's a carbine.

22:51.593 --> 22:53.359
It's from WW Two.

22:53.361 --> 22:54.762
WW Two?

22:54.764 --> 22:57.263
Shut up.

22:57.265 --> 22:59.065
That's a Kalashnikov.

22:59.067 --> 22:59.899
Russian.

23:12.448 --> 23:15.349
And this one's called
a nine millimeter.

23:17.620 --> 23:19.289
So, um,

23:21.056 --> 23:22.490
are these new?

23:22.492 --> 23:23.491
New hobby.

23:23.493 --> 23:26.163
He went to a gun show last week.

23:27.596 --> 23:29.532
Does he have bullets?

23:30.900 --> 23:33.199
He hides them in
a different place.

24:05.601 --> 24:09.102
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

24:09.104 --> 24:13.209
What are you thinking?

24:14.944 --> 24:18.548
I think you're thinking
what I'm thinking.

24:21.150 --> 24:24.318
You wanna be like those
kids at that school?

24:24.320 --> 24:25.522
In Colorado?

24:26.922 --> 24:27.756
No.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.361
No, they were fuck ups.

24:32.628 --> 24:35.298
I don't want to be like anybody.

24:40.069 --> 24:43.369
What were those kids' names?

24:43.371 --> 24:46.240
What are you the evening news?

24:46.242 --> 24:48.509
Do you wanna do this or

24:48.511 --> 24:49.346
or not?

24:52.281 --> 24:53.116
Hmm,

24:54.115 --> 24:56.419
I get to choose which one I use?

24:59.220 --> 25:00.420
Well, yeah.

25:00.422 --> 25:01.621
We'll go in with all three.

25:01.623 --> 25:04.291
The nine millimeter
'll be a backup.

25:04.293 --> 25:06.426
We gotta, we gotta
plan it, you know.

25:06.428 --> 25:10.600
We gotta plan it better
than the other thing.

25:13.101 --> 25:15.104
Yeah, that's for sure.

25:19.342 --> 25:22.275
I'm not just
talking here you know.

25:22.277 --> 25:24.046
I'm not just playing.

25:26.716 --> 25:28.717
I didn't say you were.

25:32.188 --> 25:34.090
Are you just playing?

25:35.658 --> 25:36.493
No.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.862
I think you are just playing.

25:42.864 --> 25:45.301
Well, wait and see.

25:48.771 --> 25:50.169
Come on, one more.

25:50.171 --> 25:51.440
Universe point.

26:08.658 --> 26:11.824
Have you guys been working
on your photosynthesis project?

26:11.826 --> 26:12.661
Right, I heard about that.

26:13.862 --> 26:14.831
Roddy's mother
told me about it.

26:15.563 --> 26:16.763
Mmhm.

26:16.765 --> 26:19.166
I'm really looking
forward to seeing that.

26:19.168 --> 26:20.934
What have you learned so far

26:20.936 --> 26:23.169
about photosynthesis?

26:23.171 --> 26:24.838
Photosynthesis.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.005
Some strange shit.

26:26.007 --> 26:26.939
Hey.

26:26.941 --> 26:28.207
Oh sweetheart,

26:28.209 --> 26:28.876
please don't swear in
front of your brother.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.343
He can swear.

26:30.345 --> 26:31.578
No, and neither
can you until you have kids

26:31.580 --> 26:33.446
of your own, which God help us.

26:34.749 --> 26:36.250
You don't make
the rules, okay?

26:36.252 --> 26:37.150
Yeah I do.

26:37.152 --> 26:38.420
Alright, Gus.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.055
So we got a nice call from
the vice principal today.

26:42.057 --> 26:43.523
What'd he want?

26:43.525 --> 26:45.259
He wants us all to meet.

26:45.261 --> 26:46.894
Mom!

26:46.896 --> 26:47.828
Mom!

26:47.830 --> 26:49.196
So we're all gonna meet?

26:49.198 --> 26:50.397
What?

26:50.399 --> 26:51.831
I thought we
talked about this?

26:51.833 --> 26:53.434
Mommy!

26:53.436 --> 26:55.334
Gus, what?

26:55.336 --> 26:56.302
Mommy!

26:56.304 --> 26:57.137
My gosh.

26:57.139 --> 26:58.504
Yes, hon?

26:58.506 --> 27:00.376
You're driving me nuts.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.378
Don't look at me.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.913
You don't want
us to look at you?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.347
You're okay?

27:07.349 --> 27:09.049
I'm getting very
mixed messages from you, Gus.

27:09.051 --> 27:09.983
Very weird.

27:09.985 --> 27:11.118
I want my Nerf ball.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.552
No, hon,

27:12.554 --> 27:14.187
- no balls at the table, okay?
- Now what's a matter?

27:14.189 --> 27:16.724
Do I just have a
sign on my face today?

27:16.726 --> 27:18.958
You got a glass head.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.127
Remember we use
to say that to you

27:20.129 --> 27:21.261
when you were little.

27:21.263 --> 27:22.562
Little glass head.

27:22.564 --> 27:23.400
Yeah.

27:24.432 --> 27:26.667
What am I thinking right now?

27:26.669 --> 27:29.102
You're thinking, um,

27:29.104 --> 27:32.773
I wish they'd
leave me alone.

27:34.209 --> 27:37.144
He's thinking, why do
I have to eat with them?

27:40.082 --> 27:41.881
Close?

27:41.883 --> 27:43.850
It's okay, hon.

28:40.775 --> 28:42.810
Looks great though.

28:42.812 --> 28:44.477
What are you working on?

28:44.479 --> 28:45.913
Nothing.

28:45.915 --> 28:46.750
Hey!

28:47.749 --> 28:49.986
That's really great, Edwin.

28:51.286 --> 28:52.718
It's my brother.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.790
Oh that's your brother.

28:56.659 --> 28:58.058
It's really good.

28:58.060 --> 29:00.593
It's a great use of color.

29:00.595 --> 29:02.832
Yeah, keep working on that.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.167
How's it going over here, huh?

29:17.213 --> 29:18.281
Hey, Edwin.

29:19.715 --> 29:21.682
So listen, we have to do
this world of color thing

29:21.684 --> 29:23.550
with three people in art class.

29:23.552 --> 29:24.386
And?

29:25.553 --> 29:27.724
Ms. Arnold says
you're really good.

29:28.323 --> 29:29.255
You are.

29:29.257 --> 29:30.189
You're a really good artist.

29:35.096 --> 29:36.932
What are you doing?

29:39.735 --> 29:42.002
You want time
to think about it?

29:42.004 --> 29:42.839
Um,

29:44.939 --> 29:45.842
yeah, okay.

29:47.476 --> 29:50.914
Don't forget, we
want you for our trio.

29:52.014 --> 29:55.385
Tawanda
wants to touch your art.

29:58.086 --> 30:02.257
So there are eight doors
in and out of the school.

30:03.124 --> 30:04.827
Thought there were more.

30:07.396 --> 30:09.228
I'm sorry, it's like,

30:09.230 --> 30:11.031
it's not like you
never made a mistake.

30:11.033 --> 30:12.198
You're a mistake.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.536
Your
mother's a mistake.

30:16.170 --> 30:18.205
God, I wish I could
do this by myself.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.542
Why don't you?

30:23.379 --> 30:27.414
Okay, so we have to
seal up all the doors?

30:27.416 --> 30:28.948
Yeah, but that's
the problem, dude.

30:28.950 --> 30:30.716
We have to get from there
to there to there to there

30:30.718 --> 30:33.789
and we have to do
it relatively fast.

30:36.891 --> 30:40.026
Why don't we do something
to these doors ahead of time

30:40.028 --> 30:43.196
and we can come in
through these two?

30:43.198 --> 30:46.768
We could do it in the
gym during an assembly.

30:53.275 --> 30:55.011
That's a good idea.

30:57.278 --> 30:59.515
This is a good idea, Edwin.

31:11.326 --> 31:12.928
What about these?

31:16.532 --> 31:17.464
How long does it take to pull

31:17.466 --> 31:20.434
some bungee cords off of a door?

31:25.873 --> 31:27.773
How 'bout scotch tape?

31:27.775 --> 31:29.379
I was just asking.

31:36.986 --> 31:38.118
Why don't we put
this in the door

31:38.120 --> 31:41.253
and slide it through the bars?

31:41.255 --> 31:42.488
I thought of that.

31:42.490 --> 31:43.889
You could just slide it
right back out again.

31:43.891 --> 31:45.160
Right.

32:03.911 --> 32:04.913
Gentlemen.

32:08.350 --> 32:10.449
Suppose your
brakes didn't work?

32:10.451 --> 32:12.121
My point entirely.

32:25.266 --> 32:28.871
Your parents ever try to get
you interested in sports?

32:33.074 --> 32:33.909
Music?

32:34.909 --> 32:35.745
Nah.

32:37.813 --> 32:41.013
We tried to get Roddy
excited about music.

32:41.015 --> 32:44.384
You got me one of those
pianos for like one year olds.

32:44.386 --> 32:46.719
Do you want a real piano?

32:46.721 --> 32:47.987
No!

32:47.989 --> 32:49.222
We'll get you a real
piano if you want one.

32:49.224 --> 32:50.057
If you'll play it.

32:50.059 --> 32:51.661
I don't want one!

32:53.762 --> 32:56.963
Roddy's grandmother
was a wonderful musician.

32:56.965 --> 32:58.432
Was she?

32:58.434 --> 33:00.500
She coulda
been a professional.

33:00.502 --> 33:01.868
All she did was
complain about her health

33:01.870 --> 33:04.571
and she lived to be like 102.

33:04.573 --> 33:06.238
What'd he say?

33:06.240 --> 33:07.843
What do you care?

33:09.078 --> 33:11.447
How did I end up with
a kid with no ambition?

33:12.648 --> 33:14.613
Don't worry about
the no ambition part.

33:14.615 --> 33:15.916
You got some?

33:15.918 --> 33:17.184
I'm working on it.

33:17.186 --> 33:19.586
You don't look like
you're working on it.

33:19.588 --> 33:22.558
I'm, I'm working
on it right now.

33:24.092 --> 33:24.927
Alright.

33:49.918 --> 33:51.784
What are you doing?

34:00.129 --> 34:01.328
Dude, your dad's gonna be pissed

34:01.330 --> 34:03.629
with all this
paint on the floor!

34:05.501 --> 34:06.565
You can fuck up
your skin like this

34:06.567 --> 34:08.068
if you do it long enough.

34:43.271 --> 34:45.507
Does that sound
about right, Edwin?

34:47.641 --> 34:50.643
Yeah, sounds about right.

34:50.646 --> 34:52.411
Well, here's what
we've been noticing.

34:52.414 --> 34:55.148
Edwin acts like he's
under constant pressure.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.016
He's either very
quiet or acting out

34:57.018 --> 34:58.919
in various anti-social ways.

34:58.921 --> 35:00.287
He's very bright,

35:00.289 --> 35:01.787
and has a very good
head on his shoulders.

35:01.789 --> 35:03.890
Mrs. Arnold says he's been
working very diligently

35:03.892 --> 35:06.526
with others on his art
project in her class.

35:06.528 --> 35:07.693
I've seen his work
and it's very.

35:07.695 --> 35:08.827
What art project?

35:08.829 --> 35:11.530
It's just this art thing.

35:11.532 --> 35:13.832
It's for a competition
or something.

35:13.834 --> 35:15.834
Okay, so the reason why

35:15.836 --> 35:18.738
we wanted to talk with you guys

35:18.740 --> 35:19.939
is we have noticed a shift,

35:19.941 --> 35:22.876
obviously in
behavior, this year.

35:22.878 --> 35:25.579
And I guess we were
curious if you've noticed

35:25.581 --> 35:29.249
anything in particular that
happened over the summer.

35:29.251 --> 35:32.421
Was there any kind
of traumatic event?

35:35.289 --> 35:37.459
I mean, no.

35:38.193 --> 35:39.061
Not that I know of.

35:39.961 --> 35:40.795
No.

35:41.997 --> 35:43.195
Okay, well what
about you, Edwin,

35:43.197 --> 35:45.932
have you noticed anything?

35:45.934 --> 35:47.370
No, not really.

35:49.671 --> 35:52.275
You can't think of one thing?

35:54.409 --> 35:55.577
Well, I got older.

36:00.849 --> 36:02.115
So where do we go from here?

36:02.117 --> 36:02.985
Yeah.

36:04.151 --> 36:07.187
Right, okay well
one place to start

36:07.189 --> 36:08.887
is we offer a program

36:08.889 --> 36:12.561
for extra work
with socialization.

36:13.729 --> 36:16.129
You mean for like
special ed kids?

36:16.131 --> 36:17.631
No, no.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.966
It's a workshop to help those
who are having difficulties

36:19.968 --> 36:23.769
and it's designed to
build teamwork, and trust,

36:23.771 --> 36:25.437
and they do really fun stuff.

36:25.439 --> 36:28.341
They do skits, they
do hypotheticals.

36:28.343 --> 36:29.876
How do you feel about that?

36:29.878 --> 36:31.845
Is that something that is
worth a try for you guys?

36:33.849 --> 36:34.847
I'm fine with that.

36:34.849 --> 36:36.082
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:36.084 --> 36:37.617
What about the patient?

36:37.619 --> 36:40.053
How does that sound?

36:40.055 --> 36:41.854
Fine with me.

36:41.856 --> 36:43.055
Fine with you.

36:43.057 --> 36:44.726
Okay, everything's
fine with you.

36:47.762 --> 36:49.729
Well we will
try to keep an eye out

36:49.731 --> 36:51.765
- on things on our end.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

36:51.767 --> 36:52.599
Okay, thanks.

36:52.601 --> 36:53.436
Thank you.

37:06.081 --> 37:07.416
Hey, fuck off!

37:09.851 --> 37:11.117
This is ours.

37:11.119 --> 37:13.820
What do you own
the railroad now?

37:13.822 --> 37:15.021
Those are ours too.

37:15.023 --> 37:16.722
What, are you gonna
hit us with that?

37:16.724 --> 37:20.829
You're trying to fuckin'
scare me with a rock?

37:21.697 --> 37:23.162
Dude, give me the sketchpads.

37:23.164 --> 37:24.330
Put the rock down.

37:24.332 --> 37:25.131
Give me the
fucking sketchpads!

37:25.133 --> 37:26.466
Put the rock down.

37:34.642 --> 37:37.376
Those drawings suck by the way.

37:37.378 --> 37:38.778
Find another place
to blow each other.

37:51.559 --> 37:53.693
Take your little gay
drawings with you.

37:53.695 --> 37:55.861
What the fuck is this?

37:55.863 --> 37:59.499
They've got whole drawers
full of this crap.

38:16.785 --> 38:18.553
You still pissed?

38:19.954 --> 38:21.790
You still pissed?

38:22.791 --> 38:25.260
Here put this in your mouth.

38:34.936 --> 38:37.740
You think we're
really gonna do this?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.515
I don't know.

38:48.582 --> 38:51.151
Let's talk about it later.

38:51.153 --> 38:51.986
Okay.

38:58.126 --> 39:00.959
Man we are such pussies.

39:21.849 --> 39:24.119
Ding-a-ling-ling-ling.

39:36.197 --> 39:37.031
Pst.

39:38.233 --> 39:41.504
- Dude any of these work.
- Hermie.

39:42.102 --> 39:43.202
You got money?

39:43.204 --> 39:45.671
I'm buying
something for myself.

39:45.673 --> 39:48.843
You buy somethin' for me,
you can hang around with us.

39:50.579 --> 39:51.514
Take off.

39:52.914 --> 39:54.347
You heard him, come on.

39:54.349 --> 39:55.551
Oh man.

39:58.919 --> 39:59.755
Come on.

40:00.655 --> 40:02.291
I know what I want.

40:07.561 --> 40:10.062
So you know that
kid Budzinski?

40:10.064 --> 40:12.164
No, why? You kick his ass?

40:12.166 --> 40:15.103
No. He kicked mine.

40:16.671 --> 40:18.570
You look okay to me.

40:18.572 --> 40:20.539
What'd he use a pillow?

40:20.541 --> 40:21.376
No.

40:31.218 --> 40:32.720
Your dad's here.

40:39.660 --> 40:41.561
Nice ride homie.

40:41.563 --> 40:43.129
Who's this?

40:43.131 --> 40:44.597
Friend of ours.

40:44.599 --> 40:46.164
He got a name?

40:46.166 --> 40:47.934
- Hermie.
- Herman.

40:47.936 --> 40:49.801
Seriously,
what's his real name?

40:49.803 --> 40:51.137
- Herman.
- Hermie.

40:51.139 --> 40:52.207
Herman?

40:57.711 --> 40:59.347
Nice guy.

41:12.793 --> 41:14.093
So you're hanging out

41:14.095 --> 41:15.764
in parking lots now?

41:16.664 --> 41:17.763
Library's closed.

41:17.765 --> 41:18.997
Oh that's funny.

41:18.999 --> 41:21.434
Get in the car I'll
give you a ride home.

41:21.436 --> 41:22.901
I just ate.

41:22.903 --> 41:23.738
Get in.

41:25.606 --> 41:27.409
Can we get a ride too?

41:28.175 --> 41:30.278
Say bye to the homies.

41:40.722 --> 41:43.323
You don't have
any other friends?

41:43.325 --> 41:45.024
Who else am I supposed
to be hanging out with?

41:45.026 --> 41:46.492
I don't know,
somebody at your school.

41:46.494 --> 41:47.459
It's a big school you go to.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.463
You can't...

41:50.932 --> 41:52.731
You still getting in fights?

41:52.733 --> 41:55.033
- Fights?
- Yeah fights.

41:55.035 --> 41:56.535
What are these fights anyway?

41:56.537 --> 41:57.803
How are they starting?

41:57.805 --> 42:00.309
I hate that, I hate the
thought of you fighting.

42:01.476 --> 42:02.608
Well then don't
think about it.

42:02.610 --> 42:03.542
Okay.

42:03.544 --> 42:04.711
They're certainly not fights.

42:04.713 --> 42:06.849
Well what are they then?

42:08.416 --> 42:10.450
When are we gonna
stop this sport, huh?

42:10.452 --> 42:12.852
What a week? A month? A year?

42:12.854 --> 42:14.086
- We have to wait a year?
- A week.

42:14.088 --> 42:15.120
A week?

42:15.122 --> 42:16.955
Okay I hope so.

42:16.957 --> 42:19.595
That would be
great for everyone.

42:20.762 --> 42:22.495
You tell your mom
where you were?

42:22.497 --> 42:24.796
Yeah, I left a note.

42:24.798 --> 42:27.265
Well you got some mouth
on you, you know that?

42:27.267 --> 42:28.468
Sorry.

42:28.470 --> 42:29.669
If you're not
gonna help yourself

42:29.671 --> 42:32.671
if you're not gonna
make an effort at least.

42:32.673 --> 42:33.773
I know you're
havin' a hard time.

42:33.775 --> 42:35.541
A lot of kids have a hard time.

42:35.543 --> 42:36.809
I had a hard time
when I was your age.

42:36.811 --> 42:37.776
Yeah, sure you did.

42:37.778 --> 42:38.711
Oh you don't believe me?

42:38.713 --> 42:40.213
I just said I did.

42:40.215 --> 42:41.648
Okay, so you're the only kid
who's ever gotten beaten up?

42:41.650 --> 42:43.552
I didn't even bring this up.

42:45.986 --> 42:47.222
Light's green

43:24.925 --> 43:28.229
Hey. It's okay
to be gay you know?

43:29.631 --> 43:32.868
My sister in high school,
she's in the Lesbian Alliance.

43:34.068 --> 43:36.669
What are you talking about?

43:36.671 --> 43:38.336
I told you.

43:38.338 --> 43:40.872
What did you tell her?

43:40.874 --> 43:42.341
I told her not to bring it up.

43:42.343 --> 43:44.577
Look, it was hard
for my sister too.

43:44.579 --> 43:47.747
She said she wishes somebody
had talked to her about it.

43:47.749 --> 43:49.948
You're sitting here
and calling us gay?

43:49.950 --> 43:52.350
Look, it's not
a judgment thing.

43:52.352 --> 43:54.454
Oh okay, okay.

43:54.456 --> 43:56.155
And if I called you
a fuckin' skank,

43:56.157 --> 43:59.695
would you say that that's
not a judgment thing?

44:00.928 --> 44:03.361
I hurt your feelings?

44:03.363 --> 44:04.863
I hurt her feelings.

44:04.865 --> 44:07.633
She calls me fucking queer
and I hurt her feelings.

44:07.635 --> 44:08.834
Just forget it okay?

44:08.836 --> 44:10.236
What? No we're not
going to just forget it.

44:10.238 --> 44:11.738
Flake.

44:11.740 --> 44:12.972
Fuck you too. Hey, giz
bag, listen to something.

44:12.974 --> 44:14.573
Don't touch me.

44:14.575 --> 44:16.441
Tell her she's
gotta talk to me.

44:16.443 --> 44:17.676
I'm not getting in
the middle of this.

44:17.678 --> 44:19.077
If somebody said
bad shit about you,

44:19.079 --> 44:20.445
- we'd tell you who it was.
- Yeah.

44:20.447 --> 44:22.215
I was just trying to help.

44:22.217 --> 44:23.885
Who told you that?

44:26.253 --> 44:28.187
Matthew Sfikas.

44:28.189 --> 44:30.356
Who the fuck is
Matthew Sfikas?

44:30.358 --> 44:32.024
Shit, he's that ninth
grader from detention.

44:32.026 --> 44:34.660
Well what's his damage?

44:34.662 --> 44:38.530
I told the monitor he
was playing with himself.

44:38.532 --> 44:40.533
He's just getting even.

44:41.468 --> 44:43.169
He said he saw you guys.

44:43.171 --> 44:45.037
That's the only
reason I believed it.

44:45.039 --> 44:46.738
What did he say
he saw us doing?

44:46.740 --> 44:48.776
Look, just forget it.

44:51.311 --> 44:52.313
Who is he?

44:53.414 --> 44:55.515
Point him out,
come on. Who is he?

44:55.517 --> 44:56.615
Point him out. Point him out.

44:56.617 --> 44:58.450
Dude he's not here right now.

44:58.452 --> 45:02.320
You know what? Nice
dining with you all.

45:33.521 --> 45:35.387
Why get 100 years
of detention for this kid

45:35.389 --> 45:38.157
when we can just save
him for our thing?

45:38.159 --> 45:40.392
I'll kick his ass now
and we can shoot him later.

45:40.394 --> 45:41.593
How are you gonna
kick anyone's ass

45:41.595 --> 45:44.032
with your hand all fucked up?

45:45.265 --> 45:46.899
I'll use a shovel.
I'll use a rake.

45:46.901 --> 45:48.971
You can't use a shovel.

45:51.005 --> 45:52.470
What the fuck do you care?

45:52.472 --> 45:53.805
I'll use a chainsaw if I want.

45:53.807 --> 45:56.142
Oh okay. Let's find him then.

45:56.144 --> 45:58.376
Why don't you bring your rake?

45:58.378 --> 45:59.611
Why don't you put bug
powder in his milk

45:59.613 --> 46:02.515
since that worked so
fuckin' great last...

46:02.517 --> 46:03.515
Flake.

46:05.954 --> 46:07.086
What the fuck?

46:07.088 --> 46:08.820
Get the fuck off me asshole.

46:08.822 --> 46:09.955
Get the fuck down.

46:09.957 --> 46:10.789
Oww.

46:13.994 --> 46:16.030
- I'm sick of your shit.
- Asshole.

46:16.631 --> 46:17.332
Fuck you.

46:18.700 --> 46:19.497
Fuck you.

46:29.878 --> 46:33.282
Roddy. Roddy what
is going on up there?

46:35.215 --> 46:36.948
Roddy, what's goin' on?

46:38.452 --> 46:40.285
Woah, woah, woah.
Alright, woah, hold on.

46:40.287 --> 46:42.287
Roddy, Roddy, Roddy,
no. You stop it.

46:42.289 --> 46:43.124
Fuck you.

46:44.191 --> 46:44.990
- Roddy.
- Fucking maggot.

46:44.992 --> 46:45.925
You piece of shit.

46:45.927 --> 46:47.260
Get the fuck out of my house.

46:47.262 --> 46:50.028
- Get out of my house.
- Stop it. Stop it.

46:50.030 --> 46:51.499
Fuck you.

46:51.965 --> 46:52.767
Roddy.

46:54.235 --> 46:55.100
Get out.

47:02.610 --> 47:04.412
I bet she is.

47:05.146 --> 47:06.379
Oh here he comes.

47:06.381 --> 47:07.379
Hey we hear you and
Roddy thought you were

47:07.381 --> 47:09.050
in Thunder Dome.

47:10.184 --> 47:12.754
I don't know what that means.

47:14.389 --> 47:16.358
Roddy's mother called us.

47:17.090 --> 47:17.859
Are you alright?

47:20.227 --> 47:21.063
Buddy.

47:23.363 --> 47:25.830
Want me to clean you up?

47:25.832 --> 47:28.334
Yeah?

47:28.336 --> 47:30.272
Oh honey, okay, okay.

47:34.675 --> 47:35.509
Okay.

47:38.046 --> 47:41.717
Fucking asshole.

48:03.438 --> 48:06.472
Oh, you're dressed already.

48:06.474 --> 48:08.240
Couldn't sleep.

48:08.242 --> 48:09.278
Again?

48:10.677 --> 48:13.614
Okay well come downstairs,
I'll make you some breakfast.

48:36.838 --> 48:38.838
You have 45
minutes to complete the test.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.008
It'll start when I say go.

48:58.258 --> 49:00.559
- Really good work you guys.
- Thank you.

49:00.561 --> 49:02.928
I can't wait for this
to go in the contest.

49:02.930 --> 49:04.229
Gotta think
of a name guys.

49:04.231 --> 49:05.499
Think
of a title, yeah.

49:44.171 --> 49:46.472
What are you doin' down there?

49:46.474 --> 49:48.043
I'm resting.

49:48.910 --> 49:51.077
Is it comfortable?

49:51.079 --> 49:52.814
Yeah, more or less.

49:55.849 --> 49:57.550
Model rocketry.

49:57.552 --> 49:58.720
You wanna see?

50:00.787 --> 50:01.622
No.

50:27.347 --> 50:30.151
Mr. Edwin. Hey can I
talk to you a second?

50:30.617 --> 50:32.117
Now?

50:32.119 --> 50:33.919
I know, I hate to bother
your fine dining experience.

50:33.921 --> 50:36.622
Get over here for a second.

50:36.624 --> 50:37.789
This is good.

50:39.459 --> 50:40.992
Hey so I wanted to check in

50:40.994 --> 50:43.262
and see how you're feelin'

50:43.264 --> 50:45.497
about this
socialization workshop.

50:45.499 --> 50:46.465
God.

50:46.467 --> 50:48.233
Oh come on, man.

50:48.235 --> 50:50.503
It's not gonna be that bad.

50:50.505 --> 50:52.604
You gotta just give it a shot.

50:52.606 --> 50:54.707
The bonus is it's during school

50:54.709 --> 50:57.879
so you get to miss
some class anyways.

51:01.782 --> 51:04.452
Alright here's the deal Edwin.

51:05.653 --> 51:08.153
The feeling is you can't
go on like this, man.

51:08.155 --> 51:09.120
You can't.

51:09.122 --> 51:11.293
The fights, the headaches.

51:12.459 --> 51:15.896
Somethin' pretty
extreme needs to happen.

51:21.501 --> 51:23.572
Okay here eat your lunch.

52:09.082 --> 52:11.249
You gotta help me
with this kid Budzinski.

52:11.251 --> 52:12.786
Who is this kid?

52:14.155 --> 52:16.925
You ever wash this shirt?

52:17.557 --> 52:18.659
My mom does.

52:19.526 --> 52:21.595
You ever wash those pants?

52:23.831 --> 52:25.530
So are you gonna help me?

52:25.532 --> 52:26.865
Help you what?

52:26.867 --> 52:28.466
With Budzinski.

52:28.468 --> 52:30.001
I just need help with a plan.

52:30.003 --> 52:31.503
A plan?

52:31.505 --> 52:34.439
Just hide behind a bush
and hit him with a stick.

52:34.441 --> 52:35.910
That's a plan?

52:36.977 --> 52:38.343
He's a seventh
grader, take his candy.

52:38.345 --> 52:40.278
Push him down in the sandbox.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.180
I went after him
with a whiffle bat.

52:42.182 --> 52:43.918
A whiffle bat?

52:45.086 --> 52:47.222
Took it away from me
and beat me with it.

52:50.423 --> 52:52.358
Hey man, it happens.

52:52.360 --> 52:56.028
No it doesn't.
Not to anybody else.

52:56.030 --> 52:59.200
I get my ass kicked all
the time, are you kidding?

53:00.401 --> 53:02.604
Maybe I'll just
get my dad's gun.

53:03.204 --> 53:04.470
What?

53:04.472 --> 53:06.472
See what he does then.

53:06.474 --> 53:08.207
Don't be an idiot.

53:08.209 --> 53:10.108
That'll teach him
not to fuck with me.

53:10.110 --> 53:11.175
Of course he
can fuck with you,

53:11.177 --> 53:13.047
you're like two feet tall.

53:13.914 --> 53:15.350
You can't just get a gun.

53:17.517 --> 53:19.286
Just leave me alone.

53:21.322 --> 53:24.892
All I know is someone's
gotta do something.

53:32.566 --> 53:33.666
Hello?

53:33.668 --> 53:35.100
We got a problem.

53:48.381 --> 53:50.385
Don't hang up fuck head.

53:54.088 --> 53:55.354
Hello?

53:55.356 --> 53:56.521
I'm still here.

53:56.523 --> 53:58.856
We got a problem.

53:58.858 --> 54:01.292
So I hear.

54:01.294 --> 54:02.593
You already know?

54:02.595 --> 54:05.129
You just
fuckin' told me.

54:06.767 --> 54:08.600
So what's the problem?

54:08.602 --> 54:10.568
Our pal Hermie.

54:10.570 --> 54:11.803
He told me he's getting a gun

54:11.805 --> 54:12.970
and going after
that kid he hates.

54:14.441 --> 54:16.975
No, I don't think
he's bullshitting.

54:16.977 --> 54:19.748
I'm thinking he'd screw
it up for the both of us.

54:20.881 --> 54:22.113
That certainly
is the type of shit

54:22.115 --> 54:24.285
that always happens to us.

54:26.619 --> 54:28.387
So what'd you tell him?

54:28.389 --> 54:31.256
I told him he
couldn't just get a gun.

54:31.258 --> 54:33.595
And what'd he say?

54:36.162 --> 54:38.329
Hey can we talk?

54:38.331 --> 54:40.499
Didn't say anything.

54:40.501 --> 54:41.636
Hmm.

54:42.903 --> 54:44.436
I think we
gotta talk to him.

54:44.438 --> 54:45.504
Who are you talking to?

54:45.506 --> 54:46.738
I gotta go.

54:46.740 --> 54:49.041
Oh I'll
talk to him alright.

54:49.043 --> 54:50.642
You think he would really do it?

54:50.644 --> 54:52.244
I gotta go, okay.

54:52.246 --> 54:53.879
What's wrong?

54:53.881 --> 54:54.979
Is that Roddy?

54:54.981 --> 54:56.749
Is that your mom?

54:56.751 --> 54:58.216
Yeah.

54:58.218 --> 54:59.885
Has she been
listening this whole time?

54:59.887 --> 55:00.722
No.

55:01.856 --> 55:04.689
Jesus Christ, call
me back asshole.

55:08.162 --> 55:08.997
Yeah?

55:12.099 --> 55:15.200
So you and
Roddy worked things out?

55:15.202 --> 55:16.037
Yeah.

55:21.275 --> 55:25.447
Look, I was thinking that

55:26.847 --> 55:28.747
we should go away somewhere
for your dad's birthday.

55:28.749 --> 55:30.785
Like somewhere cool, and...

55:32.419 --> 55:35.254
I don't know, how
does that sound?

55:35.256 --> 55:36.191
Sounds good.

55:37.490 --> 55:38.425
Sounds good?

55:39.260 --> 55:40.095
Okay.

55:40.994 --> 55:44.131
So where do you wanna go?

55:47.034 --> 55:48.169
The lake.

55:49.936 --> 55:51.972
Yeah, where we used
to spend summer.

55:52.872 --> 55:54.041
The lake?

55:55.809 --> 55:58.142
That's great, yeah. The lake.

55:58.144 --> 56:00.879
Okay. Oh that's gonna be...

56:00.881 --> 56:02.347
Let's take the sailboat.

56:02.349 --> 56:04.115
We haven't taken
it out for so long.

56:05.653 --> 56:09.224
You and your brother used
to just have so much fun.

56:10.423 --> 56:12.092
That's such a good
choice, hon. Okay.

56:15.695 --> 56:17.930
You can
leave the door open.

56:17.932 --> 56:18.967
I'm gonna...

56:34.414 --> 56:37.418
It's the kid
in the blue sweatshirt.

56:39.385 --> 56:40.554
Him?

56:52.032 --> 56:54.102
Boom, 21, losers.

56:55.635 --> 56:56.470
Whoa.

57:00.974 --> 57:02.309
See ya guys.

57:03.276 --> 57:05.947
So, what do we
do now, exactly?

57:11.285 --> 57:12.550
Hey
see you guys later.

57:12.552 --> 57:14.119
Oh, don't forget about
that game Wednesday.

57:14.121 --> 57:15.789
We need to win this.

57:22.061 --> 57:23.896
Working on
some construction?

57:23.898 --> 57:25.497
What do you want?

57:25.499 --> 57:27.869
So listen, you
know that kid Herman?

57:30.070 --> 57:31.102
About your size?

57:31.104 --> 57:32.637
Yeah.

57:32.639 --> 57:34.673
We're thinking... well, we
watch out for him sometimes.

57:34.675 --> 57:36.173
He's such a doofy little shit.

57:36.175 --> 57:37.776
You
got that right.

57:37.778 --> 57:40.579
Yeah, he can really be a
pain in the ass sometimes.

57:40.581 --> 57:42.517
Yeah, you got that right too.

57:45.485 --> 57:48.620
We were hoping
you could cut him some slack

57:48.622 --> 57:50.021
the next few weeks.

57:50.023 --> 57:51.291
Why should I?

57:53.059 --> 57:55.126
'Cause if you don't
we'll kick your ass.

57:55.128 --> 57:57.262
I'll
kick your ass, bitch.

57:57.264 --> 57:59.367
Is the whole 7th
grade fucking nuts?

58:00.133 --> 58:01.099
Get outta my yard.

58:01.101 --> 58:01.936
Mom!

58:02.836 --> 58:04.535
What's the matter?

58:04.537 --> 58:05.970
Get outta
my yard, mother fucker.

58:05.972 --> 58:07.905
We tried to ask
you nicely, dude.

58:07.907 --> 58:09.140
Hi Mom, what's up?

58:09.142 --> 58:10.142
Okay I'm calling
the police if you two

58:10.144 --> 58:11.642
- don't get outta my yard.
- Go!

58:11.644 --> 58:13.211
Call the police. Call
the fucking National Guard.

58:13.213 --> 58:14.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
don't talk to me like that.

58:14.914 --> 58:15.948
What are your names?

58:15.950 --> 58:17.515
I'm Ed Gein.

58:17.517 --> 58:20.218
Tell the police Ed Gein was
here and he wants your son.

58:20.220 --> 58:21.119
Get outta my yard.

58:21.121 --> 58:22.521
You inside.

58:22.523 --> 58:23.457
Let's go.

58:25.959 --> 58:28.795
Now he's really
gonna go after Hermie.

58:30.197 --> 58:32.530
We gotta figure out the
doors and move up our plan.

58:32.532 --> 58:34.332
I know.

58:34.334 --> 58:37.468
We should do it
during the next assembly.

58:37.470 --> 58:40.108
I think there's one
in the gym on Friday.

58:51.251 --> 58:54.322
I think there's something
wrong with my tooth.

59:03.063 --> 59:06.099
I could see it in
the news afterwards.

59:07.834 --> 59:10.801
The two, murderous

59:10.803 --> 59:13.106
juvenile delinquents

59:14.407 --> 59:16.410
and their whatever plan.

59:20.780 --> 59:23.985
You wuss out on me,
I'll shoot you myself.

01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:52.473
I got it.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.075
A wedge.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:57.345
What?

01:00:58.311 --> 01:00:59.244
What the fuck's with you?

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:01.381
Am I doing this alone here?

01:01:06.586 --> 01:01:07.852
A wedge?

01:01:07.854 --> 01:01:09.887
Wedges, to seal up the doors.

01:01:09.889 --> 01:01:11.622
We use wedges.

01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:12.923
We do it from the outside.

01:01:12.925 --> 01:01:14.358
One of us brings a
little hammer, bang,

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.128
we drive it under the doors.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:19.164
No one from the
inside can open them.

01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:22.733
God, I can't believe I
didn't think of that before.

01:01:22.735 --> 01:01:25.939
I can't believe even you
didn't think of them.

01:01:29.142 --> 01:01:32.813
So, does this mean
we can do it on Friday?

01:01:43.322 --> 01:01:45.222
Roddy, homework.

01:01:45.224 --> 01:01:46.727
He's just going.

01:01:48.427 --> 01:01:51.629
Do we know how much
kick these guns have?

01:01:51.631 --> 01:01:54.399
Don't hold it like a
faggot and you'll be fine.

01:01:54.401 --> 01:01:56.501
I'm not gonna hold
it like a faggot.

01:01:56.503 --> 01:01:58.269
Then you'll be fine.

01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:00.307
Look, you better go, dude.

01:02:01.775 --> 01:02:03.975
What about the
thing with Hermie?

01:02:03.977 --> 01:02:05.443
I don't know,
we gotta stall him.

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:06.847
Let me think about it.

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.863
Where's Gus?

01:02:24.865 --> 01:02:26.700
Being a sleepy head.

01:02:28.735 --> 01:02:32.439
So, you wanna hear my plan?

01:02:32.939 --> 01:02:33.775
Plan?

01:02:35.342 --> 01:02:36.778
What's your plan?

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.144
We go to the
lake this weekend.

01:02:40.146 --> 01:02:41.912
It's supposed to
be in the 70s so

01:02:41.914 --> 01:02:45.816
the water should still be warm
enough for you guys to swim.

01:02:45.818 --> 01:02:49.990
Take the sailboat, you
know, just like old times.

01:02:50.858 --> 01:02:51.655
Sounds like a good idea.

01:02:51.657 --> 01:02:53.124
Yeah?

01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:55.492
Well, I say we pick your
father up after his lecture

01:02:55.494 --> 01:02:58.329
on Friday and just go
straight from there.

01:02:58.331 --> 01:03:00.131
When's his lecture end?

01:03:00.133 --> 01:03:01.968
Like 10 or so.

01:03:05.539 --> 01:03:06.470
Friday?

01:03:06.472 --> 01:03:08.974
Yeah, this Friday.

01:03:08.976 --> 01:03:10.408
I got school.

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.142
Well, we'll take
you out early.

01:03:12.144 --> 01:03:15.012
It's like a get out
of jail free card.

01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:16.847
Come on.

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:19.753
I mean unless you're
dying to stay in school.

01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:25.457
Are you excited?

01:03:25.459 --> 01:03:26.691
I guess.

01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:29.397
You're gonna be
late, hon, come on.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.110
Are those lights
on your shoes?

01:03:45.311 --> 01:03:46.278
What happened to your eye?

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.711
Walk into somebody's boner?

01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:48.548
No.

01:03:50.182 --> 01:03:53.617
So, did we tell you
we talked to Budzinski?

01:03:53.619 --> 01:03:55.021
Oh, he told me.

01:03:58.057 --> 01:03:59.459
Did he do that?

01:04:04.932 --> 01:04:06.167
Son of a bitch.

01:04:07.367 --> 01:04:08.733
I'm gonna talk to
that little prick.

01:04:08.735 --> 01:04:12.003
Just don't talk
to him anymore.

01:04:12.005 --> 01:04:14.773
Well, he can't
just keep beating on you.

01:04:14.775 --> 01:04:16.573
Don't worry about me.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:18.678
I'll figure it out myself.

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:24.048
So, listen, we got this plan

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:25.916
but it's gonna take
some time to set up

01:04:25.918 --> 01:04:28.355
so it's gonna have
to start next week.

01:04:29.423 --> 01:04:31.055
You in?

01:04:31.057 --> 01:04:32.323
In what?

01:04:32.325 --> 01:04:33.524
In on this thing.

01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:36.831
You wanna, you wanna
get back at him or not?

01:04:39.198 --> 01:04:40.133
Whatever.

01:04:43.403 --> 01:04:44.906
Alright, then.

01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:02.923
Hey Edwin.

01:05:04.057 --> 01:05:05.392
Congratulations.

01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:07.325
It's so exciting.

01:05:07.327 --> 01:05:08.763
Thanks.

01:05:10.229 --> 01:05:12.530
You know if you win
the regional prize,

01:05:12.532 --> 01:05:14.798
you get your name in the paper.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.001
Did you ever wonder
what it would be like

01:05:16.003 --> 01:05:17.702
to see your name in the paper?

01:05:17.704 --> 01:05:19.204
Yeah.

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.142
Well, did you
ever think it might happen?

01:05:22.742 --> 01:05:24.041
Yeah.

01:05:24.043 --> 01:05:26.010
Well, go tell your parents.

01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:27.778
It's a really big honor.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.881
You know, I mean
just to get this far.

01:05:29.883 --> 01:05:33.287
It's great that it was
a group project too.

01:05:35.454 --> 01:05:36.320
I guess.

01:05:36.322 --> 01:05:37.157
Yeah.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.063
Okay, well see you later.

01:06:41.887 --> 01:06:43.957
Hey, throw the ball.

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:47.794
Thanks.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.175
Hey.

01:07:35.842 --> 01:07:36.677
Hey.

01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:39.943
What the fuck?

01:07:39.945 --> 01:07:41.646
What did you say?

01:07:41.648 --> 01:07:42.916
It's my ball.

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.619
No, what did you say to me?

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.123
I said I don't
fucking believe this.

01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.933
You're just gonna
steal my fucking ball?

01:08:05.939 --> 01:08:07.274
Come on.

01:08:08.675 --> 01:08:10.408
It's not even mine.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.480
It's my little brother's.

01:08:13.914 --> 01:08:16.317
You hear me, you fuck?

01:08:27.227 --> 01:08:28.062
Whoo.

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:35.198
Oh, these old guys.

01:08:35.201 --> 01:08:37.167
These are about ready
to go out, aren't they?

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:38.906
Leave them.

01:08:41.907 --> 01:08:43.372
Hon, I think we
can try to find you

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:44.676
another pair like them.

01:08:44.678 --> 01:08:45.946
They're fine.

01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:52.318
Why are you crying?

01:08:55.287 --> 01:08:56.520
Hey.

01:08:56.522 --> 01:08:58.756
Bit my tongue.

01:08:58.758 --> 01:09:00.158
Really?

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.126
Okay, let me see.

01:09:02.127 --> 01:09:03.496
Open your mouth.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:05.399
Let me look.

01:09:06.866 --> 01:09:09.131
Well, I can't tell if you
won't let me look at it.

01:09:09.134 --> 01:09:10.734
It's on the bottom.

01:09:10.737 --> 01:09:13.974
Okay, I'll be back
in a minute, okay?

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.051
Where's my ball?

01:09:29.054 --> 01:09:30.587
What?

01:09:30.589 --> 01:09:32.158
Where's my ball?

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:35.196
You left
it outside I think.

01:09:36.161 --> 01:09:37.595
I want it.

01:09:37.596 --> 01:09:39.529
Didn't
you leave it outside?

01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:41.033
I want it.

01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:43.301
Well,
it's too late now.

01:09:43.303 --> 01:09:44.533
We can't get it tonight.

01:09:44.536 --> 01:09:46.703
Please, hon, just go
get ready for bed.

01:09:46.705 --> 01:09:47.907
No.

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:50.678
Edwin?

01:09:52.812 --> 01:09:55.381
I'm under here now.

01:10:00.687 --> 01:10:03.424
Are we sleeping under
the bed tonight or...

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.893
Just lying here a minute.

01:10:10.463 --> 01:10:12.700
Can I ask you a question?

01:10:13.599 --> 01:10:15.001
Uh huh.

01:10:16.736 --> 01:10:18.238
What's going on?

01:10:19.406 --> 01:10:20.908
Nothing.

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:26.711
Well, you know I'm
talking to a bed here, hon,

01:10:26.713 --> 01:10:29.250
so there's obviously
something wrong.

01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:38.692
Hon.

01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:41.195
What's the matter?

01:10:45.698 --> 01:10:47.664
Hurt my face.

01:10:47.666 --> 01:10:49.503
What'd you do?

01:10:51.804 --> 01:10:53.539
Rubbed it too hard.

01:10:56.241 --> 01:11:00.079
Honey, come, Edwin
come on, come out please.

01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:07.588
Oh hon.

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:14.260
Come here, come here.

01:11:14.994 --> 01:11:16.397
Honey, it's okay.

01:11:17.597 --> 01:11:19.032
What is?

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:23.801
Whatever it is, you know.

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:26.770
I know that sometimes you
just can't handle stuff.

01:11:26.772 --> 01:11:28.338
It's too hard.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.843
I can handle it.

01:11:31.044 --> 01:11:32.877
Please don't go
getting all mad, okay?

01:11:32.879 --> 01:11:34.878
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.718
What are, what are you mad for?

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:40.584
You're just a little guy.

01:11:40.586 --> 01:11:41.688
You should...

01:12:15.522 --> 01:12:17.989
Gus, please come up and
just eat some cereal.

01:12:19.224 --> 01:12:22.360
Ah, so a nice way
to start the day.

01:12:22.362 --> 01:12:23.694
Don't make fun
of him, though, please.

01:12:23.696 --> 01:12:26.463
I'm not making fun of
him, I'm just commenting

01:12:26.465 --> 01:12:28.498
on our happy home.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.333
He didn't find his ball?

01:12:29.335 --> 01:12:30.267
No.

01:12:30.269 --> 01:12:31.068
You look outside?

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.302
You look outside?

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:33.904
Mmm hmm, he said
he looked all over.

01:12:33.906 --> 01:12:36.543
I looked all over.

01:12:37.544 --> 01:12:38.575
I know, hon.

01:12:38.577 --> 01:12:39.409
It's not the end of the world.

01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:40.981
Yes it is.

01:12:42.881 --> 01:12:44.347
How are you doing?

01:12:44.349 --> 01:12:45.983
I'm good.

01:12:45.985 --> 01:12:46.818
You look great.

01:12:49.289 --> 01:12:51.422
And the Oscar goes to... Gus.

01:12:51.424 --> 01:12:52.957
He's so sad.

01:12:52.959 --> 01:12:54.324
I think I know
where his ball is.

01:12:54.326 --> 01:12:55.258
Really?

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.828
Where, you got it?

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.529
Flake borrowed it, I think.

01:12:58.531 --> 01:12:59.463
Flake, of course.

01:12:59.465 --> 01:13:00.597
Yeah, I'll just get it back.

01:13:00.599 --> 01:13:01.632
That's good news.

01:13:01.634 --> 01:13:02.867
Yeah.

01:13:02.869 --> 01:13:04.401
Things are looking
up for you, Gus.

01:13:04.403 --> 01:13:06.639
I'll
get it, I promise.

01:13:09.308 --> 01:13:11.611
Big brother
coming through.

01:13:16.448 --> 01:13:19.052
Hey, the assembly is tomorrow.

01:13:21.054 --> 01:13:23.354
Um, I gotta go to the
dentist after school

01:13:23.356 --> 01:13:25.655
so I'll call you after dinner.

01:13:25.657 --> 01:13:27.091
My mom thinks I'm
gonna be getting braces

01:13:27.093 --> 01:13:29.459
in the next few months.

01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:32.363
I don't think that's
gonna work out.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.088
You okay, Edwin?

01:13:59.526 --> 01:14:01.495
Yeah, I got sick.

01:14:03.028 --> 01:14:05.495
Yeah, that's what I heard.

01:14:05.497 --> 01:14:06.500
You okay?

01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:12.872
So, um, what's
the class doing?

01:14:13.939 --> 01:14:16.276
I gave them an assignment.

01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:21.647
Sorry I'm missing it.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:27.153
Okay, well, I just
wanted to check on you.

01:14:38.798 --> 01:14:42.600
Um, excuse me,
you have any other colors?

01:14:42.602 --> 01:14:44.872
Sorry, guy, that's all we got.

01:15:07.794 --> 01:15:09.226
Was his ball pink?

01:15:09.228 --> 01:15:10.560
He says it wasn't.

01:15:10.562 --> 01:15:12.096
It was.

01:15:12.098 --> 01:15:13.029
He's losing his mind.

01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:14.230
Hello?

01:15:14.232 --> 01:15:15.032
He says
it was, honey.

01:15:15.034 --> 01:15:16.367
It wasn't pink.

01:15:16.369 --> 01:15:17.834
You there?

01:15:17.836 --> 01:15:18.769
I like the pink.
You don't like the pink?

01:15:18.771 --> 01:15:20.538
Are you all right?

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.404
You're panting.

01:15:21.406 --> 01:15:22.373
You sound like a dog.

01:15:26.179 --> 01:15:27.944
I'm scared.

01:15:27.946 --> 01:15:29.913
Don't wuss out on me.

01:15:29.915 --> 01:15:30.948
Do you hear me?

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:33.284
I'm not wussing out on anyone.

01:15:33.286 --> 01:15:34.784
Shit,
dude, are you crying?

01:15:34.786 --> 01:15:35.720
No!

01:15:35.722 --> 01:15:36.953
Are you gonna make it?

01:15:36.955 --> 01:15:38.689
Do I have to come over
there and sit with you?

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:39.526
No!

01:15:40.793 --> 01:15:43.260
Dude, we got
a lot to do tonight.

01:15:43.262 --> 01:15:45.930
How soon can you come over
after everybody's asleep there?

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:47.297
1:00, 1:30?

01:15:47.299 --> 01:15:48.632
Yeah.

01:15:48.634 --> 01:15:50.534
Which?

01:15:50.536 --> 01:15:51.370
1:30.

01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:55.405
All right,
come to the gate.

01:16:01.013 --> 01:16:03.516
You have a fight with Roddy?

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:08.519
Just wanted to see if he
wanted to play volleyball.

01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:11.388
Yeah well, I packed a bag
for you for the trip tomorrow.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.893
Let me know if I
missed anything.

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.367
Are you
worried your dad's

01:16:56.369 --> 01:16:57.838
gonna know they're missing?

01:16:59.037 --> 01:17:00.270
I locked
the cases back up

01:17:00.272 --> 01:17:02.573
and I left the pistols, so...

01:17:10.849 --> 01:17:13.184
This is really heavy.

01:17:13.186 --> 01:17:15.889
Hold it farther
up with that hand.

01:17:18.724 --> 01:17:20.559
You want to trade?

01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:23.397
Yeah, maybe.

01:17:26.965 --> 01:17:27.765
You want a tube?

01:17:27.767 --> 01:17:28.998
I brought two down.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.102
I'm fine.

01:17:38.777 --> 01:17:42.581
You ever worry we might
shoot all the wrong people?

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:55.062
You want to know
what I think about?

01:17:56.362 --> 01:17:59.433
How when something
terrible happens somewhere,

01:18:00.633 --> 01:18:04.403
and there's all those
flags and flowers and

01:18:05.604 --> 01:18:08.474
candles and pictures
of people who died,

01:18:09.509 --> 01:18:12.212
and pages of sayings and poems.

01:18:15.447 --> 01:18:18.384
All that shit lined
up for months.

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.789
That's what I think about.

01:18:50.448 --> 01:18:51.382
Are you kidding me?

01:18:51.384 --> 01:18:53.453
They haven't fixed this shit?

01:19:33.526 --> 01:19:35.095
What's your combo?

01:19:35.995 --> 01:19:38.031
- What's your...
- 4, 17, 23.

01:20:33.486 --> 01:20:35.689
What are you doing?

01:20:41.326 --> 01:20:43.162
Is Mommy up?

01:20:43.896 --> 01:20:45.165
No, Mommy's sleeping.

01:20:50.036 --> 01:20:52.672
You go to sleep too, okay?

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.277
You like your Nerf ball?

01:20:58.009 --> 01:21:00.446
Yeah, this one's pink.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.519
Don't be sad.

01:21:10.889 --> 01:21:13.923
That's what everyone says.

01:21:13.925 --> 01:21:16.263
Why does everyone say that?

01:21:18.763 --> 01:21:21.034
I just get so mad sometimes.

01:21:31.009 --> 01:21:32.811
How's your ear?

01:21:33.912 --> 01:21:35.913
Mom says it's still
bothering you.

01:21:35.915 --> 01:21:37.717
It hurts.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.454
How about now?

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.622
No.

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:47.826
Okay.

01:21:49.394 --> 01:21:50.828
Go to sleep.

01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:51.861
Goodnight.

01:21:51.863 --> 01:21:53.433
Goodnight, Gus.

01:21:56.134 --> 01:21:57.967
You're a great little
guy, you know that?

01:21:57.969 --> 01:21:59.071
Yeah.

01:22:00.805 --> 01:22:02.776
Leave the door open.

01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:05.378
Okay.

01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:11.116
Hey, wake up.

01:22:12.351 --> 01:22:13.385
Let's go.

01:22:16.522 --> 01:22:19.359
Hey. Gosh, you are so out.

01:22:20.492 --> 01:22:23.193
Hey, I have some errands
to run this morning,

01:22:23.195 --> 01:22:25.061
so I won't be by
the school until

01:22:25.063 --> 01:22:26.832
quarter to 12 or so.

01:22:31.504 --> 01:22:32.836
Hey.

01:22:32.838 --> 01:22:34.404
Be where I said today, okay?

01:22:34.406 --> 01:22:35.939
Don't make us come all
around the building

01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:37.740
looking for you.

01:22:37.742 --> 01:22:38.678
I won't.

01:22:42.814 --> 01:22:44.547
Where's Dad?

01:22:44.549 --> 01:22:48.354
Oh, he went in
early to practice his thing.

01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:54.794
Tell him I said good luck.

01:22:55.527 --> 01:22:57.062
Aw, okay.

01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:53.420
Do it again,
do it again.

01:23:53.885 --> 01:23:54.687
Yeah?

01:23:57.022 --> 01:23:57.954
Hey.

01:23:57.956 --> 01:23:59.858
Hey.

01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:37.030
Edwin.

01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:40.062
You're gonna go to
the bathroom, alright?

01:24:40.064 --> 01:24:41.265
And you're gonna wait
there until the bell rings.

01:24:41.267 --> 01:24:42.699
Do not go out until
the bell rings.

01:24:42.701 --> 01:24:43.967
Go to your locker,
get the duffle,

01:24:43.969 --> 01:24:45.034
bring the whole thing
to the doors, alright?

01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:46.369
I will take care of the wedge.

01:24:46.371 --> 01:24:48.105
Do not go in until you see me

01:24:48.107 --> 01:24:49.739
at the double doors, alright?

01:24:49.741 --> 01:24:51.807
We are going to go at
the same time, alright?

01:24:51.809 --> 01:24:54.780
Do not go before I go,
go when I go. Okay?

01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:56.316
Okay?

01:24:56.781 --> 01:24:57.316
Okay.

01:25:04.322 --> 01:25:05.556
Students are to report

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:06.856
to the gym after the
end of the period.

01:25:06.858 --> 01:25:08.758
Please be prompt
and ready to hear

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.694
about all the exciting...

01:26:24.737 --> 01:26:26.168
Hey, Edwin.

01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:27.973
What are you doing?

01:26:30.742 --> 01:26:32.909
You're gonna be so late, here.

01:26:32.911 --> 01:26:34.814
What's your combination?

01:26:38.082 --> 01:26:39.751
4, 17, 23.

01:26:50.062 --> 01:26:51.261
Thanks.

01:26:51.263 --> 01:26:53.600
Whatever, you're
gonna be late.

01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:51.954
Because
today is not the end,

01:27:51.956 --> 01:27:53.457
it is the beginning.

01:27:53.459 --> 01:27:54.858
Individually, many
of you perform

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.763
with the best of your ability...

01:27:57.595 --> 01:27:58.497
Hey.

01:28:00.064 --> 01:28:01.263
Safety.

01:28:01.265 --> 01:28:03.201
Turn the safety off.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.749
Oh my God!

01:28:30.763 --> 01:28:32.596
Shoot your gun!

01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:35.335
Shoot your fucking
gun, shoot it!

01:28:37.335 --> 01:28:38.702
Fire it!

01:28:49.514 --> 01:28:50.615
Oh my God!

01:28:57.356 --> 01:28:59.291
Put the gun down!

01:29:06.365 --> 01:29:07.830
Get down.
Get the gun, get the gun!

01:29:09.867 --> 01:29:11.937
Flake, no!

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:13.305
Fuck!

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.873
- Stop it!
- No, Flake!

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:18.341
Hey,
get out, get out!

01:29:19.945 --> 01:29:20.976
- Go, move!
- Settle down!

01:29:20.978 --> 01:29:24.513
No, fuck! Let me go! Flake!

01:29:24.515 --> 01:29:25.882
No!

01:29:25.884 --> 01:29:27.784
Flake! Flake!

01:29:27.786 --> 01:29:29.418
Don't move!

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:31.454
- Flake!
- Don't move!

01:29:31.456 --> 01:29:33.155
- Let me go, fuck!
- Don't move!

01:29:36.161 --> 01:29:37.029
Flake!

01:29:37.963 --> 01:29:38.898
Flake!

01:29:40.131 --> 01:29:40.963
Fuck!

01:29:47.939 --> 01:29:48.775
Flake.

01:29:51.108 --> 01:29:53.713
No. Flake.

01:30:31.683 --> 01:30:33.516
Every
weekend in the summer,

01:30:33.518 --> 01:30:34.985
we used to take this
old dumpy sailboat

01:30:34.987 --> 01:30:36.322
out onto the lake.

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.564
It looked like a dog
dish with a mast.

01:30:46.497 --> 01:30:49.332
And this one time, we
gave this guy and his kid

01:30:49.334 --> 01:30:50.803
in a Sunfish a tow.

01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:54.003
I got to be the guy
who threw the rope

01:30:54.005 --> 01:30:56.575
when we were close
enough to them.

01:31:10.522 --> 01:31:13.556
I remember when we got
home, telling my parents

01:31:13.558 --> 01:31:15.592
how great I thought it was.

01:31:15.594 --> 01:31:18.898
I remember my mom
agreeing with me.

01:31:21.133 --> 01:31:22.298
I remember the kid's face

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.202
as we bounced
through some waves.

01:31:26.138 --> 01:31:28.307
I remember how happy he was.

01:31:31.777 --> 01:31:33.079
And I thought,

01:31:34.245 --> 01:31:35.945
good for you, kid.

01:31:35.947 --> 01:31:37.517
Like I was his dad.

01:31:38.549 --> 01:31:39.619
Good for you.

01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:28.497
