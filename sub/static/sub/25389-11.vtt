WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.465
TERESA: Previously
on Queen of the South...

00:04.500 --> 00:06.331
What is this?

00:06.370 --> 00:08.190
KELLY ANNE: These are the
ownership documents

00:08.240 --> 00:09.730
filed in the Cayman Islands
for Camila's trawler company.

00:09.770 --> 00:11.362
I never signed these papers.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.479
Camila's trying to set
you up to take the fall

00:12.510 --> 00:14.239
for her business.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.044
We may have lost our supply.
Someone gave up El Santo.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.672
TERESA: We have a rat.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.712
They put a tracker
in Guero's necklace.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.843
IVAN: Basically what they did
is cast a copy of the medal,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.915
inserting a tiny 'I'I'L device.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.349
TERESA: Can we use this?
IVAN: To track someone?

00:26.390 --> 00:27.982
Absolutely.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.250
JAMES: Found the mole.
-I can't believe this.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.850
But you had no problem
suspecting me.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.267
Now, how much dinero
is it gonna cost me for me

00:36.300 --> 00:37.267
and my amigo--
(shouts)

00:37.300 --> 00:38.824
(both grunting)

00:38.870 --> 00:39.939
TERESA: Have we heard
from George?

00:39.970 --> 00:41.335
JAMES: He's been off grid.

00:41.370 --> 00:42.507
I just can't get
ahold of him.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.939
TERESA: We need to find him.

00:43.970 --> 00:44.937
There's Oleg.

00:44.970 --> 00:46.779
Congratulations, Teresa.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.449
I see bright things
in your future.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.910
I'll be in Phoenix shortly.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.552
JAMES: Call me
when you get here.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.228
(suspenseful music)

01:08.330 --> 01:11.458
(jet engines roaring)

01:15.400 --> 01:17.231
TERESA: Thank you
for meeting with me.

01:17.270 --> 01:20.569
To be honest, I wasn't thrilled
to get your call, Teresa.

01:20.610 --> 01:22.874
Last time I saw you,
you burned your relationship

01:22.910 --> 01:26.971
with Rocco in Malta and in turn
threw a lit match on mine.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.419
TERESA: I'm sorry.

01:28.450 --> 01:30.315
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.887
I'm hoping you care
more about the opportunity

01:32.920 --> 01:34.114
I have for you.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.912
Conﬁnue.

01:35.960 --> 01:40.158
I've taken control of the
Phoenix corridor in Arizona.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.226
TERESA: I have a distribution
system on the dark web.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.295
Rocco has Malta.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.969
But there's an entire
world without him.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.702
I think we can help each other.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.009
There's only one problem.

01:56.210 --> 01:59.418
My supplier's gone
off the grid.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.975
I won't share my connections
with you, Teresa.

02:02.020 --> 02:03.089
Not after Malta.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.417
(dramatic music)

02:04.450 --> 02:05.678
OLEG: Good luck.

02:05.720 --> 02:12.728
*

02:19.670 --> 02:21.831
TERESA: The meeting with
Oleg didn't go well.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.804
JAMES: There may be
another option.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.035
I'm meeting Camila now.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.606
(knocking)

02:27.640 --> 02:30.302
*

02:30.350 --> 02:32.341
James.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.642
Nice to see you again.

02:42.090 --> 02:43.751
I miss having you by my side.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.527
CAMILA: Does Teresa know?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.728
She sent me to hear you out.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.432
Mm.

02:59.410 --> 03:04.347
POTE: Whenever you're down,
you always come back stronger.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.144
POTE: _This isn't the_ time
to gIve up, TereSIta.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.081
TERESA: El Santo
is either dead or missing.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.680
There's no business
wrthout product.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.881
POTE: You know where
we could get some.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.323
No.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.852
James said that
Camila can help us.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.992
Camila is dangerous.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.725
Yes, she is.

03:24.770 --> 03:27.068
But you're safer with
her under your nose.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.193
(dramatic music)

03:29.240 --> 03:31.936
POTE: Just listen
to what she has to offer.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.528
But like you said...

03:36.750 --> 03:39.617
You might as well
go home and quit.

03:39.650 --> 03:42.346
And I know _that's not what
you want In your heart.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.917
POTE: Because you are
a survivor, Teresita.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.850
You never stop fighting.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.289
*

03:49.330 --> 03:50.854
Don't stop now.

03:50.890 --> 03:55.099
*

03:55.130 --> 03:56.461
CAMILA: I'm here for a truce.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.127
*

03:58.170 --> 03:59.899
Did you tell Teresa I could
provide a supplier?

03:59.940 --> 04:03.262
Yes, but the chances
of a sit down are slim to none.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.266
CAMILA: Teresa's
business has stalled.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.107
She needs my connection.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.608
CAMILA: You know
I can help her.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.539
Yeah, but she's not
gonna want your help.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.810
CAMILA: I know.
But she needs it.

04:14.850 --> 04:17.489
*

04:17.520 --> 04:19.317
And I certainly need hers.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.284
*

04:22.330 --> 04:24.127
It's the only way
to save my daughter.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.129
*

04:27.160 --> 04:29.128
(cell phone vibrates)

04:31.100 --> 04:32.567
It's her.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.739
*

04:34.770 --> 04:35.998
TERESA: What's her offer?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.735
*

04:37.770 --> 04:39.431
JAMES: She's asking
for a sit-down.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.902
What do you want me to do?

04:40.940 --> 04:43.249
*

04:43.280 --> 04:45.168
I'll meet with her.

04:45.210 --> 04:49.010
Take her to the safe house
close to the border.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.415
JAMES: All right.

04:50.450 --> 04:57.049
*

05:03.870 --> 05:06.839
You know I can't guarantee
your protection.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.259
CAMILA: I've run
out of options.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.098
So if I'm gonna meet
my executioner...

05:12.140 --> 05:14.199
*

05:14.240 --> 05:16.003
So be it.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.507
*

05:17.550 --> 05:21.270
POTE: So if Camila comes
through with the supply,

05:21.320 --> 05:22.878
what then?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.046
*

05:24.090 --> 05:25.648
You gonna kill her?

05:25.690 --> 05:32.698
*

05:48.780 --> 05:51.772
(music intensifies)

06:06.860 --> 06:10.990
CAMILA: I know El Santo is out.
I know you need a supplier.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.897
I can set up an introduction
with the Colombians.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.737
(dramatic music)

06:15.770 --> 06:17.328
What do you want in return?

06:17.370 --> 06:18.860
*

06:18.910 --> 06:21.071
I want you to kill Cortez.

06:21.110 --> 06:23.670
CAMILA: I came to you because
I know you despise him

06:23.710 --> 06:25.507
as much as I do.

06:25.550 --> 06:28.439
Cortez convinced my daughter
that I ordered the execution

06:28.480 --> 06:30.948
of her fianc.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.457
I did not.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.287
*

06:34.320 --> 06:37.357
And now he has her,
and I have to save her.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.085
*

06:39.130 --> 06:41.291
CAMILA: My governorship
is over.

06:41.330 --> 06:44.766
*

06:44.800 --> 06:47.564
I can set up a meeting
with Reynaldo.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.739
CAMILA: And you can get
your business back on track.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.773
*

06:52.810 --> 06:55.074
Do you want
the introduction or not?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.975
*

06:57.010 --> 06:59.740
You understand what will happen
to you if this is a trap?

06:59.780 --> 07:02.715
*

07:02.750 --> 07:03.785
You'll kill me.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.755
*

07:06.790 --> 07:09.554
And bury me
in a hole somewhere.

07:09.590 --> 07:12.058
And never think of me again.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.421
*

07:13.460 --> 07:16.122
CAMILA: I was running
for my life.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.958
And I'm standing in front of
the person that wants me dead

07:19.000 --> 07:21.389
more than anyone.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.829
The only thing that
matters to me now...

07:23.870 --> 07:27.135
*

07:27.180 --> 07:28.477
Is my daughter.

07:28.510 --> 07:34.415
*

07:34.450 --> 07:35.940
TERESA: Take her.

07:35.980 --> 07:41.987
*

07:44.060 --> 07:46.358
CASTEL: I always thought
Camila's home was a little bit

07:46.390 --> 07:50.292
over the top with
all the hard stone.

07:50.330 --> 07:54.130
Governor's Mansion seems
to surt you, General.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.934
CASTEL: Reynaldo is ready
to resume business with you...

07:56.970 --> 07:58.801
-(clears throat)
-Running Mexico.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.049
-Welcome news.
-CASTEL: Hmm.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.641
Truth is, he's in no condition
to put up much of a ﬁght.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.218
He had a health scare,
so he's traveling to the US.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.684
to see a heart specialist
as we speak.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.383
Perhaps it is your time
to take the reins.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.320
It's inevitable.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.351
And I'm a patient woman.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.563
Now excuse me, General,
but I have a plane to catch.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.067
(clears throat)

08:27.100 --> 08:29.239
CASTEL: It's always good
to see you.

08:29.270 --> 08:32.330
It's always my pleasure.
Have a safe trip, huh?

08:32.370 --> 08:34.133
Mm.
Take care.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.378
CORTEZ: (clears throat)

08:38.410 --> 08:44.315
CORTEZ: (breathing heavily)

08:44.350 --> 08:45.487
(clears throat)

08:45.520 --> 08:47.249
*

08:47.290 --> 08:50.157
(clears throat)

08:50.190 --> 08:52.920
*

08:52.960 --> 08:54.154
(breathing heavily)

08:54.200 --> 08:58.159
*

08:58.200 --> 08:59.565
SOLDIER: General?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.295
SOLDIER: General, que pasa?

09:13.080 --> 09:16.049
(dramatic music)

09:16.080 --> 09:20.881
*

09:20.920 --> 09:22.387
Is this still your brand?

09:22.420 --> 09:25.059
*

09:25.090 --> 09:26.079
CAMILA: Yeah.

09:26.130 --> 09:31.762
*

09:31.800 --> 09:33.597
Gracias, Pote.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.805
*

09:38.840 --> 09:43.641
I learned the rules of
the cartel from Epifanio.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.649
POTE: I know you were
owed for his life.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.979
You killed the man
that Teresa loved.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.113
You collected your payment.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.913
*

09:53.960 --> 09:56.258
And you still kept coming.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.053
POTE: Now you're
the one who owes.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.990
*

10:00.030 --> 10:02.419
I see that you and James have
been doing a lot of the killing

10:02.460 --> 10:06.089
for Teresa.
The entire Comisin.

10:06.130 --> 10:09.236
Impressive.
It's interesting, though.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.500
*

10:11.540 --> 10:14.338
She never approved of violence
when she was working for me.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.507
POTE: She's la jefa now.

10:20.550 --> 10:22.108
and her business.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.287
Mm.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.787
*

10:24.820 --> 10:27.914
Must be eating away at her.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.656
To become what she
hated the most.

10:30.690 --> 10:31.952
And what's that?

10:31.990 --> 10:33.753
*

10:33.800 --> 10:35.495
Me.

10:35.530 --> 10:38.522
POTE: She's nothing like you.

10:38.570 --> 10:41.767
You don't even deserve
to speak her name.

10:41.800 --> 10:46.976
I know more about running
a cartel than she ever will.

10:47.010 --> 10:48.671
*

10:48.710 --> 10:50.177
And you know that.

10:50.210 --> 10:54.909
*

10:58.820 --> 11:00.879
Or I will shut it
for you for good.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.957
*

11:03.990 --> 11:06.379
You're welcome to try.

11:06.430 --> 11:09.991
*

11:10.030 --> 11:14.330
Now get comfortable
in your new mansion.

11:14.370 --> 11:21.378
*

11:29.550 --> 11:30.744
JAMES: Hey.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.317
JAMES: I understand not wanting
to do the deal with Camila.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.385
But the offer is good.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.557
Reynaldo Fieto is loyal
to the Vargas family,

11:39.590 --> 11:43.663
so if she vouches for you,
you have a supplier again.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.897
You ask me,
Camila owes you this.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.534
You've built this business up
through sheer determination.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.731
This move is a building
block for your future.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.448
Let's make the deal
with Reynaldo,

11:58.480 --> 12:00.573
then move on to Cortez.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.713
The rest we'll figure
out afterwards.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.557
I'm not gonna be
there for the rest.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.080
(dramatic music)

12:10.130 --> 12:11.722
JAMES: I can't work
for someone who keeps

12:11.760 --> 12:14.024
questioning my loyalty.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.290
Not after all
we've been through.

12:16.330 --> 12:22.269
*

12:22.300 --> 12:23.938
I'm gonna help you
take out Cortez,

12:23.970 --> 12:27.098
make sure you're secure,
but then I'm out.

12:27.140 --> 12:32.077
*

12:32.110 --> 12:33.338
TERESA: James.

12:37.350 --> 12:44.358
*

13:02.610 --> 13:05.579
(dramatic music)

13:05.610 --> 13:08.170
*

13:08.220 --> 13:09.414
(door closes)

13:09.450 --> 13:12.510
*

13:12.550 --> 13:18.682
Someone in this room
was brave enough to attack me.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.129
*

13:20.160 --> 13:23.869
But who is brave enough
to confess?

13:23.900 --> 13:28.462
*

13:28.500 --> 13:34.177
CORTEZ: Who put poison
in my wine?

13:34.210 --> 13:36.178
Who would do this to me?

13:36.210 --> 13:37.438
*

13:37.480 --> 13:39.004
CORTEZ: Hmm?

13:39.050 --> 13:43.146
Not only am I
physically wounded,

13:43.190 --> 13:47.149
but my heart breaks
from this betrayal.

13:47.190 --> 13:51.286
(gunshot)
(all gasping)

13:51.330 --> 13:55.494
When the body is wounded,
the wound festers.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.566
What's rotten
must be hacked away!

14:02.840 --> 14:09.302
Emperor Claudius was poisoned
by his wife, Agrippina.

14:09.340 --> 14:12.548
A single dose in
his evening meal.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.414
*

14:16.450 --> 14:21.717
Is my little chef
a student of history?

14:25.790 --> 14:27.599
Oh, no.

14:27.630 --> 14:28.892
(crying)

14:28.930 --> 14:29.919
*

15:08.640 --> 15:15.637
*

15:23.650 --> 15:26.084
(groaning)

15:26.120 --> 15:28.759
(coughing)

15:28.790 --> 15:31.054
*

15:31.090 --> 15:36.050
(crying)

15:36.100 --> 15:38.125
I want my security doubled.

15:38.170 --> 15:42.231
*

15:42.270 --> 15:44.807
Move out to our new
headquarters Immediately.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.731
*

15:48.780 --> 15:51.408
(sirens blaring)

15:51.450 --> 15:53.441
(elevator dings)

15:53.480 --> 15:55.072
LOUDSPEAKER: Satellite
pharmacy, 713.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.840
Satellite pharmacy, 713.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.256
CAMILA: Reynaldo.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.827
REYNALDO: Camila.
-How are you, my friend?

16:06.860 --> 16:09.454
REYNALDO: The doctors tell me
that if I take my pills,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.424
I'll live another 20 years.

16:12.470 --> 16:16.839
My very ambitious niece would
love me to retire tomorrow.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.132
CAMILA: Does Cast_el know
you're meeting With us?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.104
REYNALDO: N0.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.870
I wanted to hear the terms of
the deal before I pass anything

16:22.910 --> 16:25.276
along to her.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.847
May I introduce Teresa Mendoza.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.709
Nice to meet you.

16:33.190 --> 16:36.887
I was very surprised when
Camila asked me to see you.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.457
REYNALDO: I'm not in the habit
of doing business with

16:39.490 --> 16:42.323
the enemies of my friends.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.169
You killed Epifanio.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.623
And now you expect me
to work with you.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.992
Even Camila knows I had no
choice but to defend myself.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.076
TERESA: Cortez is your enemy.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.169
You need a new partner
in Mexico.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.869
That's true.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.341
The past is buried, Reynaldo.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.813
Camila.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.511
CAMILA: I promise you.

17:04.550 --> 17:07.713
_ I underestimated Tere_sa
In more than one occasnon.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.581
CAMILA: She will
take out Cortez.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.396
And this will be a good
partnership for you.

17:14.430 --> 17:17.228
(dramatic music)

17:17.270 --> 17:19.090
*

17:19.130 --> 17:24.067
When I heard that malparido
Cortez had turned against her,

17:24.110 --> 17:26.533
I wanted _to cut off
his COJones.

17:26.570 --> 17:30.199
*

17:30.250 --> 17:33.947
I will work with you, but only
if you defeat the General.

17:33.980 --> 17:38.542
*

17:38.590 --> 17:40.751
And there i_s_one
more condition.

17:40.790 --> 17:46.023
*

17:46.060 --> 17:48.699
He'll give us product.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.221
What are the terms?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.919
Camila can't be harmed.

17:52.970 --> 17:56.292
*

17:56.340 --> 17:57.602
What did you tell him?

17:57.640 --> 17:59.369
*

17:59.410 --> 18:00.570
I agreed.

18:00.610 --> 18:03.477
*

18:03.510 --> 18:05.398
You okay with that?

18:05.450 --> 18:06.974
*

18:07.010 --> 18:09.740
I know Teresa told you
she'll keep me safe.

18:09.780 --> 18:13.819
But what happened between us
was very personal.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.317
I don't think she'll keep
her promise to you.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.298
CAMILA: You know me, Reynaldo.

18:22.330 --> 18:25.822
I won't go down without
a very bloody fight.

18:25.870 --> 18:31.934
*

18:49.490 --> 18:51.151
The last time I spoke
with King George,

18:51.190 --> 18:54.455
he was in Mexico.
Did you kill him?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.469
No, he's still alive.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.922
He's being held under
a different name

18:58.970 --> 19:00.335
in a mental institution.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.759
Only Cortez and I know
the location.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.836
Give the location to Pote.

19:04.870 --> 19:07.338
TERESA: We need George's
weapons to take down Cortez.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.870
We'll get him out.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.140
I delivered my part
of the arrangement.

19:11.180 --> 19:13.171
I want to go now.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.848
TERESA: I agreed
I wouldn't harm you.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.780
I didn't say I'd give
you your freedom.

19:17.820 --> 19:24.828
*

19:34.770 --> 19:36.635
TERESA: Hey.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.662
Hey, there's been chatter on
the wire about General Cortez.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.507
JAMES: He's left
the Governor's Mansion.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.804
And there's been reports that
a military caravan

19:43.850 --> 19:46.068
is heading north
out of Culiacn.

19:46.110 --> 19:48.169
He's holding up with dozens
of his best soldiers

19:48.220 --> 19:49.517
and stockpiles of weapons.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.518
He knows Camila's out there.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.916
He's expecting an attack.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.815
He'll be putting up massive
defenses securing entry points

19:56.860 --> 20:00.751
around the perimeter,
hardening his forces.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.394
He's got every possible
resource at his disposal.

20:03.430 --> 20:06.661
If we make a move,
he'll be ready.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.190
It'll be close to impossible.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.231
If we do this, we need
more men and an arsenal.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.534
Camila knows where
George is being held.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.407
TERESA: We need to rescue him.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.374
Then get his weapons.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.776
TERESA: He keeps caches
of weapons all through Mexico

20:19.810 --> 20:23.211
like the ones he brought
to Taza's reservation.

20:23.250 --> 20:27.186
You're right.
We need more men and guns.

20:27.220 --> 20:31.088
That's why we contacted
Javier Jimenez, Boaz's cousin.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.779
I know that guy.
He's a clown.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.457
Yeah?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.798
He's the leader of the
Death Squad out of Juarez.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.196
POTE: He's crazy.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.266
But he's one of the toughest
cabrones I know.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.599
(motorcycle engine running)

20:44.640 --> 20:51.648
*

21:04.430 --> 21:07.228
TERESA: Javier, welcome.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.228
I'm Teresa.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.659
*

21:10.700 --> 21:12.668
You're more beautiful
than people say.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.167
*

21:14.200 --> 21:16.395
Had to be something very
special for this cabron

21:16.440 --> 21:17.668
to leave Camila.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.837
Show some respect, cabron.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.077
That was respect.

21:22.110 --> 21:23.646
Ask James.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.409
JAVIER: He knows
I tell it like it is.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.849
In between all the bullshit.

21:28.150 --> 21:29.674
Is Boaz coming?

21:30.850 --> 21:31.942
No.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.787
(dramatic music)

21:33.820 --> 21:36.459
He's not coming out of hiding
until he knows this is no

21:36.490 --> 21:38.185
bullshit setup.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.620
TERESA: We have Camila.
She's being held inside.

21:41.660 --> 21:45.699
*

21:45.730 --> 21:46.958
POTE: Hey.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.132
*

21:53.170 --> 21:55.479
You believe Camila didn't
order Kique's death?

21:55.510 --> 21:57.478
*

21:57.510 --> 22:01.014
I believe Cortez killed
Kique to get to Camila.

22:01.050 --> 22:06.181
*

22:06.220 --> 22:08.654
(speaking Spanish)

22:08.690 --> 22:10.282
*

22:10.320 --> 22:12.527
Does Boaz still have men?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.028
*

22:15.060 --> 22:17.221
A few dozen.

22:17.260 --> 22:19.296
We started a small
operatIon In Nogales.

22:19.330 --> 22:21.798
JAVIER: Just across the border.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.468
We need your help
to get our smuggler out

22:24.510 --> 22:26.330
of a Mexican hospital.

22:26.370 --> 22:30.704
He'll provide us with guns
to take Cortez down.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.810
I'd love to feed Cortez
hIs own tongue.

22:33.850 --> 22:36.011
*

22:36.050 --> 22:37.688
But Boaz is going
to need something

22:37.720 --> 22:40.245
more than just revenge.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.884
What does he want?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.480
*

22:45.530 --> 22:46.827
To be in business with you.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.021
*

22:49.060 --> 22:50.391
We can discuss that.

22:50.430 --> 22:52.193
*

22:52.230 --> 22:55.563
TERESA: We can work together
and take down Cortez.

23:03.410 --> 23:06.049
POTE: James has
the information on Cortez.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.718
Good.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.547
Did he tell you he's leaving?

23:09.580 --> 23:12.811
No.
It doesn't surprise me.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.583
I made a mistake.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.154
I want him to stay.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.788
Did you tell him that?

23:30.610 --> 23:32.635
TERESA: Hey.

23:32.670 --> 23:36.538
So, Pote and I will meet Boaz
and you will meet Javier

23:36.580 --> 23:38.775
and his men near the hospital.

23:38.810 --> 23:41.119
Using that guy is a risk.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.687
You can't go into Mexico
without backup.

23:46.350 --> 23:47.453
You're the boss.

23:47.490 --> 23:50.789
(dramatic music)

23:50.830 --> 23:53.458
TERESA: You helped
build this business.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.127
You shouldn't walk
away from it.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.094
*

23:57.130 --> 23:59.667
I want you to run Phoenix.

23:59.700 --> 24:03.238
*

24:03.270 --> 24:04.806
Is that just a business offer?

24:04.840 --> 24:09.470
*

24:09.510 --> 24:10.670
I don't wanna lose you.

24:10.710 --> 24:17.718
*

24:18.690 --> 24:20.419
I just need a little time
to think about it.

24:20.450 --> 24:21.451
*

24:21.490 --> 24:22.514
TERESA: Yes, of course.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.152
*

24:24.190 --> 24:25.748
Be careful in Mexico, okay?

24:25.790 --> 24:27.929
*

24:27.960 --> 24:28.949
JAMES: Yeah, you too.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.461
*

24:37.170 --> 24:40.139
(Tejano music plays)

24:40.170 --> 24:46.507
*

24:47.520 --> 24:50.478
(singing in Spanish)

24:50.520 --> 24:57.528
*

25:02.360 --> 25:04.965
POTE: You sure we
can trust Boaz?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.558
I'm not sure about anything.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.364
TERESA: But he's already
sent Javier to help us.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.737
*

25:14.780 --> 25:17.340
(parrot squawking)

25:17.380 --> 25:18.506
Teresa Mendoza.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.071
Thank you for meeting me.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.849
It only makes sense.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.040
It's not like I got people
lining up to work with me.

25:27.090 --> 25:31.880
Got a small heroin business
and a bounty on my head.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.591
So do you.

25:33.630 --> 25:35.518
BOAZ: Javier told me
about your meeting.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.198
*

25:37.230 --> 25:39.425
El hijo de puta Cortez
has to pay for what he did

25:39.470 --> 25:40.698
to my Kique.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.264
*

25:42.300 --> 25:43.858
I'm sorry for your loss.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.161
*

25:45.210 --> 25:46.734
That boy was my heart.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.431
*

25:48.480 --> 25:52.143
If you get payback for me,
I'm all yours.

25:58.950 --> 26:02.113
(cell phone vibrates)

26:04.560 --> 26:06.926
I have to take this.
Excuse me.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.121
*

26:09.160 --> 26:10.388
Thank you.

26:10.430 --> 26:12.125
*

26:12.170 --> 26:14.138
-Hey.
JAMES: Hey.

26:14.170 --> 26:17.139
Yeah, I'm with Javier.
We're en route to the hospital.

26:17.170 --> 26:20.139
-How many men are with you?
JAMES: Half a dozen.

26:20.170 --> 26:23.139
I'll let you know when we're
ready to move on George.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.807
TERESA: Keep me posted.

26:26.280 --> 26:32.788
*

26:34.790 --> 26:39.284
After we take out Cortez,
you'll run Sinaloa.

26:39.330 --> 26:42.322
I would like you to share any
major decisions with James.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.588
TERESA: We'll work together.

26:43.630 --> 26:45.063
*

26:45.100 --> 26:47.967
You can count on that,
Teresa Mendoza.

26:55.710 --> 26:58.645
-Salut.
POTE: Salut.

27:08.990 --> 27:15.998

27:19.230 --> 27:21.266
Shall we celebrate?

27:21.300 --> 27:25.304
*

27:25.340 --> 27:29.106
To the one person
in the world I can trust.

27:29.140 --> 27:34.168
*

27:54.770 --> 27:57.637
Isabela.

27:57.670 --> 28:01.504
I love you as if you were
my own flesh and blood.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.839
*

28:04.880 --> 28:06.370
My mother is dead to me.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.809
*

28:07.850 --> 28:09.511
You're my only family now.

28:09.550 --> 28:16.513
*

28:16.560 --> 28:18.482
(radio chatter in Spanish)

28:18.530 --> 28:23.320
(speaking in Spanish)

28:23.360 --> 28:25.726
*

28:25.770 --> 28:27.567
JAMES: Are your guys
ready to go?

28:27.600 --> 28:30.262
JAVIER: They'll be guarding
the perimeter.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.700
All of this to rescue
a smuggler?

28:32.740 --> 28:35.174
I've got 20 different smugglers
you could choose from.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.837
JAMES: Not like this one.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.040
Let's go.

28:38.080 --> 28:45.088
*

28:50.620 --> 28:52.554
(blow lands)

28:52.590 --> 28:59.598

(door clangs)

29:08.110 --> 29:10.772
*

29:10.810 --> 29:16.373
Bilal, where's George?
Bilal, where's George?

29:16.420 --> 29:18.388
JAMES: Hey!
Something's wrong with him.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.957
(buzzing)
(announcement in Spanish)

29:20.990 --> 29:23.049
(shouting in Spanish)

29:23.090 --> 29:28.153
*

29:28.200 --> 29:31.169
(men shouting in Spanish)

29:31.200 --> 29:33.293
Those are Cortez's soldiers.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.434
Cover me.

29:35.470 --> 29:36.494
(music intensifies)

29:36.540 --> 29:40.408
(gunfire)

29:40.440 --> 29:43.477
(fire alarm blaring)

29:57.360 --> 29:58.827

JAVIER: (shouting in Spanish)

30:01.030 --> 30:02.258
(grunts)

30:02.300 --> 30:03.858
JAVIER: My gun's jammed.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.765
JAMES: You're fine.
We're almost out.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.998
*

30:10.040 --> 30:14.170
(both grunting)
(blows landing)

30:14.210 --> 30:20.240

30:21.650 --> 30:23.618
(gunshot)

30:23.650 --> 30:25.015
*

30:25.050 --> 30:26.517
Come on.

30:26.550 --> 30:30.008
JAVIER: (breathing heavily)

30:30.060 --> 30:31.459

(grunts)

30:31.490 --> 30:36.291

30:40.000 --> 30:41.331
BILAL: (grunts)

30:41.370 --> 30:46.808

30:46.840 --> 30:49.138

30:52.580 --> 30:54.309
*

30:54.350 --> 30:56.045
You have him?

30:56.080 --> 30:57.718
JAMES: George wasn't there.
Bilal was shot.

30:57.750 --> 31:00.913
He might not make it.
It was an ambush.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.518
Camila set us up.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.423
(scoffs)

31:13.470 --> 31:14.732
Did you see their faces?

31:14.770 --> 31:17.238
CORTEZ: Like rats in a flood.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.202
I thought Camila might go for
the smuggler to help her

31:21.240 --> 31:22.537
escape the country.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.901
So I put a contingency
in place.

31:24.950 --> 31:29.341
But I'm not certain how Teresa
Mendoza found the location.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.348
Camila must have
gIven It to her.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.779
They are bitter enemies.

31:33.820 --> 31:36.357
Their alliance
is highly unlikely.

31:36.390 --> 31:39.120
Unless Camila has something
to offer that means more

31:39.160 --> 31:41.253
to Teresa than vengeance.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.858
El Santo.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.290
CORTEZ: She lost her supply.
-Mm-hmm.

31:46.330 --> 31:50.289
Would your uncle make a deal
like this behind your back

31:50.340 --> 31:53.366
to give Teresa product
to save Camila's life?

31:53.410 --> 31:55.207
He's always been
very fond of her.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.878
It's possible.

31:56.910 --> 31:58.309
(cell phone vibrates)

31:58.350 --> 32:00.147
Please excuse me.
I have another call.

32:00.180 --> 32:02.148
CORTEZ: I'll keep you apprised
of anything new.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.579
Please do, General.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.485
(beeping)

32:08.660 --> 32:10.287
CORTEZ: Bueno.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.981
BOAZ: Hey, puto.

32:12.030 --> 32:15.124
*

32:15.160 --> 32:16.923
Boaz.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.825
I sent you a link.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.792
*

32:20.830 --> 32:21.831
(beeping)

32:28.380 --> 32:29.802
We're coming for you, cabron.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.341
*

32:31.380 --> 32:33.746
(phone beeping)

32:33.780 --> 32:36.772
(computer speaking Spanish)

32:39.620 --> 32:42.953
JAMES: Those men who attacked
us were soldiers--military.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.254
Those pendejos knew
we were coming.

32:45.290 --> 32:46.951
Are you sure George
wasn't there?

32:46.990 --> 32:50.027
_ Yeah. _
CamIIa gave you the locatIon?

32:50.060 --> 32:52.164
Yeah.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.031
Can we still get at Cortez?

32:54.070 --> 32:57.597
JAVIER: It's harder now.
Se cabron knows we're coming.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.937
JAMES: He's right.

32:58.970 --> 33:01.006
The guy will be building
up his security.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.179
And we don't even
know where he is.

33:03.210 --> 33:06.543
Call Taza and tell him we need
his men at the swing gate.

33:06.580 --> 33:09.640
-We getting a shipment?
-No, not yet.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.319
I'm gonna see what I can figure
out about Cortez's location.

33:12.350 --> 33:13.442
Okay.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.459
(dramatic music)

33:16.490 --> 33:19.323
*

33:19.360 --> 33:21.555
Se cabron saved my ass
at the hospital.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.852
*

33:23.900 --> 33:26.164
You have a good soldier.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.394
I know.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.795
*

33:28.840 --> 33:30.296
(knocking)

33:30.340 --> 33:31.329
SOLDIER: (speaking Spanish)

33:36.110 --> 33:37.509
GEORGE: (groans)

33:38.850 --> 33:40.408
I'm very sorry, Your Majesty.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.418
I had planned on putting
your suffering

33:42.450 --> 33:43.849
to an end this evening.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.586
But apparently there's
been a breach

33:45.620 --> 33:47.542
at your former accommodations.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.727
CORTEZ: Did any
of my men get to you?

33:52.760 --> 33:55.354
I know not everyone
can be trusted.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.369
(dramatic music)

33:58.400 --> 33:59.719
*

33:59.770 --> 34:02.034
Someone made contact with you,
huh?

34:02.070 --> 34:05.233
*

34:05.270 --> 34:08.034
(groans)

34:08.080 --> 34:10.401
Ah.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.908
(heavy breathing)

34:12.950 --> 34:15.214
CORTEZ: Tell me.

34:15.250 --> 34:18.287
Come on.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.687
You have been in solitary
too long, huh?

34:21.720 --> 34:23.449
CORTEZ: This caused
you to stop usmg

34:23.490 --> 34:25.754
your famously
wicked tongue, huh?

34:25.790 --> 34:28.054
We'll see what else
you're good for.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.968
You lied about
George's locatIon.

34:40.140 --> 34:42.279
George wasn't there?

34:42.310 --> 34:44.403
CAMILA: They must
have moved him.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.202
(dramatic music)

34:46.250 --> 34:47.945
I didn't set you up, Teresa.

34:47.980 --> 34:49.641
*

34:49.680 --> 34:52.410
If there was a trap,
it was meant for me.

34:52.450 --> 34:54.259
Not you.

34:54.290 --> 34:57.657
-Trust me.
-I don't.

34:57.690 --> 34:59.226
CAMILA: Of course you don't.

34:59.260 --> 35:05.119
*

35:05.170 --> 35:07.388
You believe I betrayed
you in Dallas.

35:07.430 --> 35:09.591
I did not.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.837
CAMILA: My attorney sent
the paperwork to frame you.

35:12.870 --> 35:17.409
When the time came, I couldn't
bring myself to hurt you.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.771
And that's the truth.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.641
*

35:20.680 --> 35:23.478
I did not turn on you.

35:23.520 --> 35:27.240
I had grown quite fond of you.

35:27.290 --> 35:29.656
*

35:29.690 --> 35:31.624
I always believed
you were special.

35:31.660 --> 35:33.150
*

35:33.190 --> 35:35.158
CAMILA: Different.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.259
You just assumed
the worst of me.

35:37.300 --> 35:40.189
*

35:40.230 --> 35:44.360
And you left me no choice
but to send James after you

35:44.410 --> 35:46.435
to protect my business.

35:46.470 --> 35:49.598
Just as you're
protecting yours now.

35:49.640 --> 35:54.646
But regardless,
we need to trust each other.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.341
Out of necessity.

35:56.380 --> 35:59.543
Where did Cortez move George?

35:59.590 --> 36:01.285
*

36:01.320 --> 36:02.548
CAMILA: I dunno.

36:02.590 --> 36:04.649
*

36:04.690 --> 36:06.226
We lost the element
of surprIse.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.296
We need to get it back.
Give me your phone.

36:08.330 --> 36:12.528
*

36:12.570 --> 36:13.798
CORTEZ: Bueno.

36:13.830 --> 36:15.866
TERESA: It's Teresa.

36:15.900 --> 36:21.031
You have something I want,
and I have something you want.

36:21.070 --> 36:22.071
Let's make a deal.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.549
(dramatic music)

36:31.590 --> 36:38.587
*

37:21.230 --> 37:27.066
*

38:10.450 --> 38:12.589
CORTEZ: Hola, Teresa.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.759
My apologies for not being
there in person.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.418
It seemed like
a needless risk.

38:17.460 --> 38:21.180
Shall we discuss your terms?

38:21.230 --> 38:24.199
We both get our supply
from the Colombians.

38:24.230 --> 38:28.121
You run Sinaloa,
and we keep the peace.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.535
*

38:29.570 --> 38:32.266
I find those terms amenable.

38:32.310 --> 38:36.007
CORTEZ: I look forward
to a fruitful partnership.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.803
Where's George?

38:37.840 --> 38:39.148
CORTEZ: My men
will assist you.

38:39.180 --> 38:46.188
*

39:01.600 --> 39:05.400
Now, what about my prize?

39:05.440 --> 39:12.448
*

39:29.400 --> 39:32.198
Reynaldo's condition is that
Camila can't be harmed.

39:32.230 --> 39:33.697
TERESA: If anything
happens to her,

39:33.730 --> 39:35.698
we both lose our supply.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.492
You have my word.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.735
She will be safe
in my custody.

See Me in a Crown")

* Bite my tongue, bide my
time, wearing a warning sign *

-You okay?

39:54.720 --> 39:56.256

39:56.290 --> 39:58.884

Teresita.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.602

the way they all *

40:49.280 --> 40:52.807
* Scream,
tell me which one is worse *

40:52.850 --> 40:55.478
I'm excited for your return,
Camila.

40:55.520 --> 41:00.082
CORTEZ: Your days as
a fugitive are nearly done.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.988

I've got cooked up for you.
