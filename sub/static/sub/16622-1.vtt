[Voice breaking] Kate?

[Siren wails]

00:51.549 --> 00:53.883
- [Gasps]
- Patrick: What happened?

00:55.915 --> 00:58.114
- What happened?
- [Whimpers]

00:58.589 --> 01:01.591
- Dad, wh... what happened?
- I don't know!

[Police radio chatter]

01:10.665 --> 01:12.460
Eric, son...

01:12.480 --> 01:14.633
What can I do for you?

01:15.206 --> 01:16.840
[Indistinct shouting]

01:16.874 --> 01:19.008
The police are here.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.578
You want to stay with Kate, that's fine.

01:21.612 --> 01:23.113
Officer: Everyone behind the barricade.

01:23.147 --> 01:24.581
What can we do for you, son?

01:24.615 --> 01:26.382
[Indistinct shouting]

01:28.619 --> 01:30.553
Sir, you need to move back.

[Smooches]

01:35.659 --> 01:39.596
Eric... Eric, I'm so sorry.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.131
Eric?

01:41.151 --> 01:43.199
- What happened?
- Who could have done this?

01:43.234 --> 01:45.568
- Man: Did she jump?
- [Crowd murmuring]

01:45.603 --> 01:47.804
Sir, I need you to please step aside.

01:47.838 --> 01:50.938
We'll be right here, son.
We're not going anywhere.

02:08.592 --> 02:11.494
Who let the grieving husband
contaminate my crime scene?

02:11.529 --> 02:14.097
Looky-loos got their phones out.

02:14.131 --> 02:17.167
If you're afraid to do your job,
I suggest you find another.

02:17.201 --> 02:19.269
Please tell me
the roof has been secured.

02:19.303 --> 02:20.870
Yes, ma'am.

02:30.281 --> 02:32.448
Woman: Did you see anything?

02:34.357 --> 02:36.052
Mr. Warner?

02:38.956 --> 02:40.790
Mr. Warner?

02:40.824 --> 02:43.660
I'm Detective Andrea Cornell.

02:44.568 --> 02:46.930
I know this is impossibly difficult,

02:47.977 --> 02:51.401
but can you please let go of the victim?

02:53.504 --> 02:55.104
She's my wife.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.807
But she's also my victim.

02:57.841 --> 02:59.445
[Camera shutter clicks]

02:59.465 --> 03:01.978
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:02.272 --> 03:05.682
But I need to find out
what happened to her.

03:05.716 --> 03:08.818
We can go in the lobby and talk.

03:14.058 --> 03:16.659
[Crying]

03:21.532 --> 03:24.234
Amanda... I know you two were close.

03:24.268 --> 03:26.536
- Don't!
- [Gasps] I'm sorry. I-I-I...

03:26.556 --> 03:28.738
- Hey, baby...
- I was trying to help. I...

03:28.772 --> 03:31.674
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay.

03:31.709 --> 03:33.810
It's okay.

03:33.844 --> 03:35.712
[Sobbing]

03:36.312 --> 03:38.679
Are you gonna be all right?

03:48.753 --> 03:51.995
I know this is incredibly difficult,

03:52.029 --> 03:53.997
but I'm gonna need
to ask you some questions

03:54.031 --> 03:57.333
while the information
is still fresh in your minds.

04:00.021 --> 04:02.372
How could... how could this happen?

04:02.406 --> 04:03.973
That's what I'm gonna find out.

04:05.265 --> 04:08.274
I understand there was a party
upstairs at your firm?

04:08.294 --> 04:10.380
[Up-tempo music playing,
elevator bell dings]

04:10.414 --> 04:12.582
[Indistinct conversations, greetings]

04:12.616 --> 04:14.083
Wow.

04:15.619 --> 04:17.253
[Chuckling] Hey!

04:17.288 --> 04:19.589
Here's the man of the hour.

04:19.623 --> 04:21.024
Congratulations, Eric.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.259
Thank you, Phil.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.750
Congratulations, Eric... truly.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.462
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

04:26.497 --> 04:27.563
[Camera shutter clicks]

04:27.598 --> 04:29.766
- Aww. Hi.
- Hey, sweetheart.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.900
Mwah!

04:30.934 --> 04:33.303
[Chuckles]

04:33.337 --> 04:35.238
Dad, I can't thank you enough.

04:35.272 --> 04:38.177
For what? I'm not
just giving you the firm.

04:38.197 --> 04:39.609
- You earned it.
- Mm.

04:39.629 --> 04:42.111
Will you please explain
that he is not the boss of me?

04:42.146 --> 04:43.504
I'm afraid not.

04:43.524 --> 04:45.982
You've been keeping me out of
trouble, and now it's his turn.

04:46.016 --> 04:48.111
- Good luck.
- [Chuckles]

04:49.777 --> 04:52.114
- Neil: So, where's your husband?
- In the O.R.

04:52.134 --> 04:55.892
Because he's brilliant
and talented and in demand.

04:55.926 --> 04:57.393
Congratulations, buddy.

04:57.428 --> 04:59.492
- Thank you.
- Yep. Kate.

04:59.512 --> 05:00.797
[Clears throat]

05:00.831 --> 05:02.231
- Hey.
- [Chuckling] Hey.

05:02.943 --> 05:04.581
My god, you look gorgeous!

05:04.601 --> 05:06.269
Aww. Marriage agrees with me.

05:06.303 --> 05:07.236
- Mm.
- Ah!

05:07.271 --> 05:08.804
Actually, I'm glad
that you brought that up,

05:08.839 --> 05:10.673
because I introduced you to my brother,

05:10.707 --> 05:13.976
and I still haven't received
a gift or cash.

05:14.011 --> 05:16.145
- Check's in the mail.
- Ah.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.516
- Can I see the cards, please?
- No. Mnh-mnh.

05:18.536 --> 05:20.627
Son, your speech is not
for a few hours yet.

05:20.647 --> 05:23.419
I think that perhaps, just for tonight,

05:23.453 --> 05:26.253
you should try and be
more like your brother.

05:27.391 --> 05:28.791
[Chuckles]

05:28.825 --> 05:31.294
Patrick knows how to have a good time.

05:31.328 --> 05:32.361
Hey!

05:32.396 --> 05:34.964
[Laughter]

05:34.998 --> 05:36.519
Why are you retiring?

05:36.539 --> 05:39.135
It was the right time
for Eric to take over.

05:39.169 --> 05:41.437
Was anyone unhappy about that?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.739
No. We were all very excited.

05:44.755 --> 05:46.676
Had Kate been drinking tonight...

05:46.710 --> 05:49.099
perhaps a little bit more than usual?

05:49.119 --> 05:51.398
No. She wasn't drinking.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.785
What about her state of mind?

05:55.819 --> 05:58.888
Did you notice any recent
changes in behavior?

05:58.922 --> 06:00.856
Are you asking if Kate jumped?

06:00.891 --> 06:02.358
- What?
- No.

06:02.392 --> 06:04.227
It was an accident, right?

06:04.261 --> 06:06.229
It's unlikely.

06:06.913 --> 06:08.798
Kate fell from the roof.

06:08.832 --> 06:11.470
I need to know
if I'm investigating a murder

06:11.490 --> 06:12.868
or if this was a suicide.

06:12.903 --> 06:15.086
My wife didn't kill herself.

06:15.872 --> 06:17.673
How can you be so sure?

06:22.012 --> 06:24.680
- 'Cause she was pregnant.
- [Gasps]

06:26.550 --> 06:28.538
[Groans]

06:28.558 --> 06:30.319
I just found out today.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.389
[Whimpers]

06:33.423 --> 06:34.757
It's our first.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.525
[Breathes deeply]

06:36.560 --> 06:37.893
You ready?

06:43.233 --> 06:45.334
Something you want to tell me?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.548
I already know.

06:51.794 --> 06:53.642
How?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.412
You found it.

07:06.432 --> 07:08.339
You're not that stealth.

07:08.359 --> 07:09.592
[Chuckles]

07:09.976 --> 07:12.348
This is what you were
gonna tell me, right, that...

07:12.368 --> 07:15.049
that I'm the man? I mean...

07:15.899 --> 07:17.867
Look what I did.

07:19.269 --> 07:22.004
- You can say it.
- You're the man.

07:22.039 --> 07:24.774
I want more conviction.
You can... [chuckles]

07:26.743 --> 07:27.758
You okay?

07:27.778 --> 07:30.313
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's... it's the hormones, baby.

07:30.347 --> 07:32.114
I'm just... I'm emotional.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.785
[Police radio chatter]

07:37.692 --> 07:40.164
We hadn't told anyone yet.

07:40.924 --> 07:42.925
Oh, my god. Patrick.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.360
[Breathing heavily]

07:50.300 --> 07:51.667
[Sniffles]

07:51.702 --> 07:52.802
[Sighs]

07:52.836 --> 07:54.603
[Clears throat]

07:54.638 --> 07:55.805
[Sniffles]

07:55.839 --> 07:58.307
Detective... [Sniffles]

07:58.342 --> 08:00.176
I know you are just doing your job...

08:00.210 --> 08:03.216
and... Your reputation precedes you...

08:03.236 --> 08:04.765
but I am an attorney with the...

08:04.785 --> 08:07.283
I know who you are, counselor.

08:07.317 --> 08:10.378
You work for the Public
Defender's office.

08:15.691 --> 08:18.828
I'm sure the questions can wait.

08:19.651 --> 08:21.191
And when you do interview my brother,

08:21.211 --> 08:24.006
I will need to be there...
as his counsel.

08:25.991 --> 08:27.570
Of course.

08:30.838 --> 08:33.775
Again, I'm so sorry for your loss.

08:43.053 --> 08:44.887
Why did you stop her?

08:46.269 --> 08:49.959
Eric, that cop is not on your side.

08:49.993 --> 08:52.183
Cornell thinks Kate was murdered.

08:52.203 --> 08:54.110
M-Mandy, that's not what she said.

08:54.130 --> 08:57.162
I don't care what she said, okay?

08:57.182 --> 08:59.904
Listen to me... please.

08:59.938 --> 09:01.372
Okay? [Sighs]

09:01.406 --> 09:04.895
They are investigating this
as a homicide.

09:07.261 --> 09:08.879
When a wife is murdered,

09:08.914 --> 09:12.183
9 times out of 10, the husband did it.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.964
Kate is dead.

09:15.854 --> 09:17.655
You're the husband.

09:17.689 --> 09:19.811
You are the prime suspect.

09:27.220 --> 09:30.557
Patrick: Bro... Anything you need.

09:31.412 --> 09:33.723
Amanda: I'm so sorry, Eric.

09:34.128 --> 09:37.990
Son, I can't begin to imagine your pain.

09:40.344 --> 09:42.085
We all love you.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.421
[Inhales sharply]

09:46.455 --> 09:47.769
I don't want to do this now,

09:47.789 --> 09:51.459
but the police aren't gonna
give us time to grieve,

09:51.494 --> 09:54.429
so we all need to be prepared.

09:54.463 --> 09:57.540
Detective Cornell won't rest
until someone is behind bars.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.160
That's a good thing, isn't it?

10:00.129 --> 10:04.132
Not if Eric is the one
she wants to put there.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.201
Are you sure that's what she wants?

10:06.577 --> 10:08.486
I do this for a living.

10:08.838 --> 10:10.363
Melanie: They don't even know
what happened yet.

10:10.383 --> 10:13.408
I mean [Sniffles] do
you know what happened?

10:13.442 --> 10:15.294
Does... does anyone?

10:15.978 --> 10:17.745
The cops have to treat
this like a murder

10:17.780 --> 10:19.372
until they can prove otherwise,

10:19.392 --> 10:22.050
which is why Eric will
be their prime focus.

10:22.084 --> 10:26.415
But everyone at the party
is a person of interest,

10:26.556 --> 10:28.323
especially anyone
she can put on the roof

10:28.357 --> 10:30.124
around the time Kate died.

10:34.770 --> 10:38.233
But, Eric, please do not
speak to her without counsel.

10:39.076 --> 10:41.169
Everything that you say can be twisted

10:41.203 --> 10:43.137
and used against you, and it will.

10:43.172 --> 10:46.908
A little soon for defcon 5, Mandy.

10:46.942 --> 10:49.410
Fine... Dad can get someone
else, a whole team of lawyers,

10:49.445 --> 10:51.279
and they'll say the same thing,
and maybe you'll believe them.

10:51.313 --> 10:54.115
No, no, no. We understand.

10:56.385 --> 10:58.079
Are we done?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.708
I'm going home.

11:00.814 --> 11:02.107
Er...

11:02.224 --> 11:04.626
Hey. Eric.

11:04.660 --> 11:05.860
This isn't a good idea.

11:06.193 --> 11:08.796
Really. You can't go back to the
loft, and you shouldn't be alone.

11:08.831 --> 11:10.265
Melanie's right.

11:10.794 --> 11:12.835
Why don't we stay at Dad's?

11:14.734 --> 11:16.152
- Dad?
- Hmm.

11:16.172 --> 11:18.439
Why don't you and Eric
stay at the house? Yes.

11:18.474 --> 11:21.175
No. I have to get my stuff.

11:22.311 --> 11:24.012
I'll... I'll get it for you.

11:24.032 --> 11:26.847
- [Elevator bell dings]
- All right. Then it's settled.

11:30.486 --> 11:32.420
[Sighs]

11:39.662 --> 11:42.664
No glove, no love, Detective.

11:46.168 --> 11:48.303
[Elevator bell dings]

11:51.543 --> 11:53.808
[Police radio chatter]

11:55.244 --> 11:56.839
Counselor.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.347
An officer will need
to follow your brother home

11:59.381 --> 12:02.684
to take custody of his
clothes for processing.

12:02.718 --> 12:04.886
We'll be at my father's.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.587
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

12:06.622 --> 12:08.656
We'll have to do forensic
tests in the morning,

12:08.691 --> 12:12.191
so I suggest you and your family
stay away from the office.

12:34.249 --> 12:36.184
[Silverware clinking]

12:39.818 --> 12:41.356
You okay?

12:41.390 --> 12:43.121
[Clears throat]

12:43.141 --> 12:44.859
No.

12:44.893 --> 12:46.790
Why are you sweating?

12:47.463 --> 12:49.245
It's hot as hell in here.

12:49.265 --> 12:50.465
No, it's not.

12:50.499 --> 12:51.466
[Groans lightly]

12:51.500 --> 12:54.268
- Are you ill?
- No.

12:57.271 --> 12:59.407
Couldn't sleep, either, huh?

12:59.441 --> 13:01.476
[Sighs]

13:01.510 --> 13:03.411
I have something.

13:05.023 --> 13:06.132
[Sniffs]

13:06.152 --> 13:08.149

so let's make it as soon as possible

24:52.628 --> 24:54.596
and get it over with, okay?

25:05.247 --> 25:06.975
[Elevator bell dings]

[Elevator bell dings]

25:16.185 --> 25:18.086
Detective!

25:23.559 --> 25:26.861
I don't know
what everyone is telling you,

25:26.896 --> 25:29.050
but I loved my wife.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.747
Were you on the roof?

25:36.906 --> 25:38.840
I didn't kill Kate.

25:38.874 --> 25:40.308
That's not what I asked.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.846
I'll find out anyway...

25:44.880 --> 25:47.215
with or without you.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.989
You don't think she...

26:23.439 --> 26:27.248
- It's not possible that she...
- No, that... that wasn't Kate.

26:27.268 --> 26:28.895
You weren't exactly a fan.

26:28.915 --> 26:30.217
Not true.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.956
Look, you're my buddy,

26:31.991 --> 26:35.727
and, for obvious reasons,
I don't trust women.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.763
She was compliance.
That's like internal affairs.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.465
Nobody likes them.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.233
Nobody with something to hide.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.428
Again, not true.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.903
You know how you're driving along,

26:46.923 --> 26:49.307
sober, observing the speed limit,

26:49.341 --> 26:51.009
and suddenly you got a cop
in your rearview,

26:51.043 --> 26:52.677
and now you...
you know how you tense up...

26:52.711 --> 26:55.303
your hands at 10:00 and 2:00,
and your breathing stops...

26:55.323 --> 26:57.901
you are aware that I'm black, right?

26:58.517 --> 27:02.086
My point is, it's normal
to be uncomfortable

27:02.121 --> 27:05.590
in the face of judgment by
authority, especially with women.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.333
It's remarkable that none
of your marriages worked.

27:08.353 --> 27:09.460
[Chuckles]

27:14.166 --> 27:16.501
Kate didn't commit suicide.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.202
Someone killed her.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.471
I just don't know how this happened.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.541
The party was all family,
employees, investors...

27:23.575 --> 27:26.007
all people we know and their dates.

27:27.626 --> 27:28.796
Who...

27:30.649 --> 27:33.518
Who would have pushed
my wife off the roof?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.042
Morning.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.323
Hello.

[Coffee pouring]

[Sighs]

28:07.886 --> 28:09.654
Look, when I hired you,

28:09.688 --> 28:11.689
you were just my sister's
friend from law school.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.391
I never thought... - you think I <i>did?</i>

28:14.482 --> 28:16.394
What do you think they'll say?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.335
You're the boss, and I'm "that woman."

28:18.355 --> 28:19.697
Nobody would ever say that.

28:19.731 --> 28:20.966
No, no, not to my face.

28:20.986 --> 28:22.767
I have had to fight for <i>everything,</i>

28:22.787 --> 28:24.535
and in one fell swoop,
that all goes away

28:24.570 --> 28:25.937
because you want to take this public.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.404
Okay, what do you want to do?

28:27.424 --> 28:29.258
You want to sneak around
for the next 30 years?

28:29.293 --> 28:30.975
- [Sighs]
- Okay, fine.

28:30.995 --> 28:32.028
There's only one thing to do.

28:32.241 --> 28:33.908
I'll go get another job.

28:33.943 --> 28:36.277
Oh, that's ridiculous.
It's your father's firm.

28:36.312 --> 28:38.580
- I'm not giving you up.
- [Sighs]

28:38.614 --> 28:40.548
And I'm not keeping this hidden anymore.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.517
Listen, um...

28:42.551 --> 28:45.140
I'm just gonna save you two some time.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.688
F.Y.I.

28:47.481 --> 28:48.523
We all know.

28:48.557 --> 28:51.325
[Chuckles] So you're not
fooling anyone, except...

28:51.345 --> 28:53.528
maybe yourselves.

28:55.976 --> 28:58.333
Just get over it. Okay?

30:02.498 --> 30:03.998
Somebody was in here.

30:04.033 --> 30:05.667
Doesn't look like anything was taken.

30:05.701 --> 30:07.602
Should we tell the cops about this?

30:07.636 --> 30:10.432
Well, they'll dust it for prints
and get back many sets...

30:10.452 --> 30:12.540
Kate's, her assistant's...

30:12.575 --> 30:13.908
Yours.

30:18.814 --> 30:21.410
- Is that yours?
- Kate's.

30:21.430 --> 30:23.017
Kate has a white iPad.

30:23.052 --> 30:24.652
I was with her when she bought it.

30:24.687 --> 30:26.321
Guess she had two.

30:27.656 --> 30:29.657
Did you know she had a P.O. Box?

30:29.692 --> 30:31.058
What?

30:31.078 --> 30:32.827
She got a text message about a package.

30:32.861 --> 30:35.697
I didn't even know that
she had a post office box.

30:35.731 --> 30:37.498
I didn't, either.

30:39.803 --> 30:42.609
Listen, uh, Eric...

30:42.741 --> 30:44.950
The autopsy's done.

with dad for the results.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.834
Okay.

30:57.528 --> 30:59.551
Whenever you're ready.

31:04.408 --> 31:06.477
I heard you spoke to Cornell earlier.

31:06.511 --> 31:07.778
Is anything private?

31:07.812 --> 31:10.997
- Not if it happens in the lobby.
- And not anymore.

31:11.017 --> 31:12.616

[Door opens]

Why are you here?

31:18.890 --> 31:20.691
For the autopsy results.

31:20.725 --> 31:24.175
I didn't tell anybody to notify
you that it was completed.

31:24.432 --> 31:26.860
I have friends, detective.

31:29.385 --> 31:33.671
Kate Warner, 36-year-old female,
died from a 12-story fall.

31:33.705 --> 31:38.008
The impact severed her spine
in the cervical and thoracic regions.

31:38.043 --> 31:41.946
There were perimortem bruises on
the brachia, indicating a struggle.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.887
Based up on that and the final
position of the body,

31:44.907 --> 31:47.183
this is a homicide.

31:48.257 --> 31:50.210
Tests indicate the victim
didn't have anything to drink

31:50.230 --> 31:51.556
or any drugs in her system,

31:51.576 --> 31:53.724
but we're awaiting the final toxicology.

31:53.758 --> 31:56.954
The victim was approximately
eight weeks pregnant.

31:58.661 --> 32:01.104
As far as skeletal abnormalities
that preceded death,

32:01.124 --> 32:04.120
there were signs of a healed
fifth metatarsal fracture

32:04.140 --> 32:07.919
and evidence of separation
of the pelvic girdle.

32:07.939 --> 32:09.260
There was?

32:11.624 --> 32:14.612
- What does that mean?
- That means...

32:16.012 --> 32:17.381
Kate had a baby.

32:17.415 --> 32:19.717
No. She was going to have a baby.

32:19.751 --> 32:23.387
- It was our baby.
- Yes, your wife was pregnant.

32:23.664 --> 32:28.089
But her body shows that she already
gave birth to a full-term infant.

If we get a bigger place,

you can have an office
and put it in there.

your murder investigation?

their accounts, the sooner...

- Yeah.

39:31.451 --> 39:33.934
Why? Because he's the prime suspect?

39:33.954 --> 39:36.238
Actually, until you're all
cleared, everyone's a suspect.

39:36.258 --> 39:38.633
Amanda said you would do this.

39:38.653 --> 39:41.393
- Do what, exactly?
- Eric, don't.

39:41.428 --> 39:44.657
- What do you want?
- Please... stop talking to her.

39:44.677 --> 39:46.232
You're my lawyer, right?

39:46.266 --> 39:47.965
Let's get this over with.

39:48.563 --> 39:50.534
You want to know if I was on that roof?

39:50.554 --> 39:53.823
Oh, I already know.
The office windows don't open,

39:53.843 --> 39:55.741
and Kate's body was too
close to the building

39:55.775 --> 39:57.009
for you to look out and see it.

39:57.043 --> 40:00.613
So the only way you could know
that your wife was on the ground

40:00.647 --> 40:02.027
is if you were on the roof.

40:02.047 --> 40:05.195
And if you talked to me, instead of
talking to everyone else about me,

40:05.215 --> 40:06.736
you would know I have an explanation.

40:06.756 --> 40:07.723
Oh, I'm sure you do.

40:07.757 --> 40:09.925
Eric, she was ignoring you
to make you do this.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.460
I did not kill my wife.

40:11.494 --> 40:14.029
[Guests murmuring]

40:14.064 --> 40:16.421
What about Steven Porter?

40:21.004 --> 40:25.213
See, I know you were at Gatling juvenile
detention center for six months.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.218
I have friends, too.

40:29.972 --> 40:32.281
You claim you didn't murder your wife.

40:34.084 --> 40:36.168
What about Steven Porter?

40:40.890 --> 40:43.125
I didn't mean to kill him.
