00:03.280 --> 00:07.196
If you're going to go on the attack, you haveto
be prepared for a proportionate response.

00:07.220 --> 00:11.376
There are times when restraint is a
farbetter option than engaging the enemy.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.320
Dad.

00:24.210 --> 00:26.780
Bye, Daddy. Miss you.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.350
Bye, sweetie. I miss you, too.

00:34.850 --> 00:37.780
What do you know? We
finally have a moment...

00:39.620 --> 00:41.200
alone.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.396
Noah!

00:51.420 --> 00:54.300
What did your father say
to you not two minutes ago?

00:58.130 --> 01:00.340
Go and clean your room.

01:03.030 --> 01:07.360
Fine. If the prince won't do it unless
the king is home, the evil queen will.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.536
No, wait!

01:10.560 --> 01:13.046
You know what? Noah, we cannot go through
this every time your father deploys.

01:13.070 --> 01:15.666
- Stop! No! I'll do it.
- You're 12 years old.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.696
Should not have to do this for you.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.566
You should be able to do this
sort of thing for yourself.

01:19.590 --> 01:22.730
No! I said I'll do it.

01:24.190 --> 01:26.046
What are you hiding in here?

01:26.070 --> 01:28.430
Nothing... it's just my stuff.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.470
It... it's just Pokemon cards.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.170
Really?

01:36.890 --> 01:40.606
And what special powers
does Miss February have?

01:40.630 --> 01:42.920
It's Eddie Kemp's.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.250
He wants it back.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.436
Honey, real women do not look this way.

01:49.460 --> 01:53.426
They airbrush out every single
pimple and scar and anything else

01:53.450 --> 01:55.520
- that they don't want you to see.
- Yeah, okay.

NCIS Season06
Episode19 Hide and Seek.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.380
I do not know, Tony. It
is a miracle of science.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.540
It is. I mean, it's the weirdest thing.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.100
Why doesn't the glue stick
to the inside of the bottle?

02:42.130 --> 02:44.386
You must know this. McGeek, why?

02:44.410 --> 02:45.570
Not now.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.866
If not now, when?

02:46.890 --> 02:49.190
Two minutes, 29 seconds.

02:49.490 --> 02:51.750
What are you up to, McSneaky?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.870
Robert Forgan hickory-shafted
hand-forged irons.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.906
Aren't those the same
clubs that Ducky has?

02:58.930 --> 02:59.900
Had.

02:59.930 --> 03:04.536
I borrowed them and accidentally backed over them
with a golf cart before I made it to the first tee.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.950
Did you tell Ducky?

03:05.980 --> 03:07.066
Are you kidding?

03:07.090 --> 03:09.660
He told Ducky, he'd end up
on one of his autopsy tables.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.990
I am going to tell Ducky once I
successfully win a replacement set.

03:14.030 --> 03:15.660
Perhaps if you just explained...

03:15.690 --> 03:20.436
That you destroyed a set of handmade clubs
given to Ducky by some Scottish nobleman?

03:20.460 --> 03:21.636
Yeah. Good luck with that.

03:21.660 --> 03:25.066
Guys, I am in the crucial final moments of
this auction, so if you don't mind, please...

03:25.090 --> 03:26.870
- Oh, sorry.
- Of course.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.306
Aren't you supposed to make a bid?

03:31.330 --> 03:35.826
You don't place your bid until the very last
moment so that no one has a chance to outbid you.

03:35.850 --> 03:39.510
It is called sniping and...

03:40.130 --> 03:41.790
You didn't win.

03:41.820 --> 03:42.770
I've been out-sniped.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.906
Speaking of snipers,
has anyone seen Gibbs?

03:45.930 --> 03:47.810
Gear up.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.420
You're not Gibbs.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.836
There was a gun found
in navy base housing.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.706
Abby, that doesn't
warrant a team call-out.

03:53.730 --> 03:56.280
(A) There are thousands
of guns on a navy base...

03:56.310 --> 03:58.036
(And B) you're not Gibbs.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.600
Okay, what if I told you that the
base MPs gave me the gun to test?

04:01.630 --> 04:03.156
Doesn't warrant a team call-out.

04:03.180 --> 04:07.590
And the gun was found under a
kid's bed, and it was loaded.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.070
Still does not warrant a call-out.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.966
And it was recently fired.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.720
It's not a call-out.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.935
You heard the lady... gear up.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.116
They only listen to their master, Gibbs.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.060
Only you can crack the whip.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.316
Only you can drink this swill.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.030
It's just a gun on a navy base, boss.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.036
There's brain matter
on the barrel, DiNozzo.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.496
Somebody shot someone in
the head with that weapon.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.846
You left that part out, Abby.

04:32.870 --> 04:36.130
That's right, people. Mush.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.830
NCIS... Special Agent
Gibbs. Mrs. Taffet?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.130
Yes.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.150
We need to talk to your
son, Noah, about the gun he found.

04:48.570 --> 04:51.040
Yes, of course. Come... come on in.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.810
Excuse me.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.510
Home by 11:00.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.096
That's not what Dad and I agreed to.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.520
In case you haven't noticed,
there has been a regime change.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.810
Next time, I'mgoing to Iraq.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.076
So, where did you find the gun, Noah?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.680
I found it at the playground.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.610
Just lying there? On the ground?

05:15.670 --> 05:17.510
In the storm drain.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.820
Why did you take it?

05:21.380 --> 05:23.160
Because he's obsessed with guns.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.470
I'm not obsessed with guns.

05:24.500 --> 05:29.570
It's all he and his friends talk
about: M4s and Tech-9s and AK-47s.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.880
Sorry.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.890
Why did you take the gun?

05:39.360 --> 05:42.860
I guess... I thought it was cool.

05:44.070 --> 05:48.030
Would you still think it was cool if I told
you this gun was used to kill somebody?

05:50.410 --> 05:52.716
Naked girls and guns.

05:52.740 --> 05:54.846
That's what childhood
dreams are made of.

05:54.870 --> 05:57.606
Guessing we experienced
very different childhoods.

05:57.630 --> 06:01.646
You're going to tell me that little Timmy
never had a magazine with pictures of girls?

06:01.670 --> 06:04.956
Little Timmy never had a
magazine with pictures of girls.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.656
- Pictures of boys?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.810
It was calledScouting Life.

06:10.890 --> 06:14.136
I suppose you had a
subscription toPlaypen by age 12?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.420
Ten. We all chipped in.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.140
Playpenwas practically required
reading back in boarding school.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.630
You know what my father would've done
to me if he found this in my room?

06:25.050 --> 06:26.580
Stolen it back?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.720
Slap me on the side of the head with it.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.356
That sounds vaguely familiar.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.556
McGee, DiNozzo.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.550
Come on.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.870
You sure this is where
you found the gun?

06:46.380 --> 06:48.440
Yeah. It was right in there.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.370
Do you rember which way
the barrel was pointing?

06:55.590 --> 06:57.140
That way.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.236
He's a good boy, Agent Gibbs.

07:03.260 --> 07:06.260
- He just wants so badly to be grown up.
- Yeah.

07:06.830 --> 07:09.006
Well, it's always hard
when their dads deploy.

07:09.030 --> 07:11.480
It wasn't that easy
before Mike deployed.

07:11.510 --> 07:15.570
I've got one entering puberty and another
entering the house at 5:00 in the morning.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.806
These friends of Noah's?

07:23.830 --> 07:26.360
Yeah, that's Zane Wilson
and Travis Buckley.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.270
They're Noah's best friends.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.226
Excuse me a second.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.660
Hey, guys... Travis. Zane.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.170
You got a minute?

07:41.810 --> 07:44.680
So, Zane, your dad deployed, too?

07:51.450 --> 07:54.000
He talk to you about telling the truth?

07:58.660 --> 08:01.330
Is this where Noah found the gun?

08:03.230 --> 08:05.370
He didn't find it.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.846
Travis did.

08:07.870 --> 08:09.996
Is this an official interrogation?

08:10.020 --> 08:10.786
No.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.026
'Cause if it is, I should
have a lawyer present.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.790
Why, you do something wrong, Travis?

08:14.830 --> 08:16.250
That's called entrapment.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.286
Says who?

08:17.310 --> 08:19.840
My mom. She's a lawyer.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.746
- Your friends ever show you the gun?
- No.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.376
- Never told you about it?
- Nuh-uh.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.106
Never showed you the
bullets in the magazine?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.430
It didn't have a magazine.

08:31.420 --> 08:34.326
So, you see, the thing is, Noah,

08:34.350 --> 08:39.696
that our lab found this sediment
inside the barrel of the gun,

08:39.720 --> 08:44.080
but it doesn't match the
sandy residue that, uh...

08:44.640 --> 08:47.380
that we found inside the storm drain.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.516
Guess somebody must have moved it.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.856
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.110
Travis? Maybe. Zane?

08:56.590 --> 08:59.100
I don't know. Maybe you?

09:01.950 --> 09:04.700
So, where was the gun really found?

09:07.860 --> 09:11.090
Zane, where did Travis find the gun?

09:14.810 --> 09:17.000
Next to the dead body.

09:26.630 --> 09:29.916
This reminds me of the forests
I used to have fun in as a child.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.360
Find that hard to believe.

09:31.390 --> 09:33.130
What, that Israel had forests?

09:33.170 --> 09:35.326
No, that you had fun as a child.

09:35.350 --> 09:36.740
Oh, sure.

09:36.770 --> 09:41.620
My father used to blindfold us and
take us into the middle of the forest,

09:41.660 --> 09:44.870
and then we had to find
our way out by ourselves.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.696
I stand corrected.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.606
I thought it was around here.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.446
This is where you found the body?

09:51.470 --> 09:53.700
Yeah, but...

09:55.510 --> 09:57.790
It looks different with all the grass.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.220
How many of you boys are Scouts?

10:02.200 --> 10:06.110
No Scouts? Anyone rember
the position of the sun?

10:07.090 --> 10:09.986
Landmarks? Streams?

10:10.010 --> 10:14.480
Fallen trees? Unusual-looking rocks?

10:14.960 --> 10:18.066
Oh, yeah, it was right next to that tree
that Travis said looked like a naked woman.

10:18.090 --> 10:19.516
- I did not.
- Did so.

10:19.540 --> 10:20.036
Did not.

10:20.060 --> 10:22.016
- You totally did, Trav.
- I didn't say naked.

10:22.040 --> 10:27.606
Hey, guys, we're not going to spend the night dodging
trains and pulling leeches out of our underwear.

10:27.630 --> 10:32.346
Got me? Stand by Me. Little movie
reference. Kiefer's best work.

10:32.370 --> 10:37.430
All right, you guys can rent that movie
after you show us where you found the body.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.490
- Their moms are on the way.
- Thanks.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.120
Their moms are going to
help us find the body?

10:48.040 --> 10:50.500
They're not coming to
help them find the body.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.976
They're coming to be
with them when they do.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.950
Oh, right.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.746
- Yeah, Abbs?
- I got something on the gun.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.216
Be right there.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.296
- Ziva, you're with me.
- Lucky you.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.346
DiNozzo, you're in charge. Find the body.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.150
Lucky me.

11:06.430 --> 11:09.690
Okay. Boys, focus.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.340
Show us where you found the body.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.070
We didn't keep the gun now.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.940
You were the one who
told them about the body.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.716
What was I supposed to do, lie?

11:19.740 --> 11:22.436
- Yes.
- I can't believe this.

11:22.460 --> 11:27.086
McGee, do you have any idea what
world of pain these kids will be in

11:27.110 --> 11:28.790
when their dads get home?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.256
You ever see The Great Santini?

11:30.280 --> 11:32.286
Don't need to see it. I lived it.

11:32.310 --> 11:35.396
Oh, yeah, I forgot old man
McGee was navy, wasn't he?

11:35.420 --> 11:36.900
That's right.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.026
Yeah, this was my childhood.
I was just like these kids.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.230
Which one were you?

11:41.270 --> 11:44.070
The skinny one, the quiet one
or the one with the hot mom?

11:50.980 --> 11:52.750
Boys!

11:57.170 --> 12:00.500
I've been running the DNA from
the brain matter on the gun.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.156
No matches yet. As a matter fact, I
don't have any test results back yet.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.370
I didn't say I didn't have anything.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.306
This gun was used to commit...

12:07.330 --> 12:10.206
Murder. Yeah, I already know that, Abbs.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.710
Do you know who was shot?

12:11.740 --> 12:13.070
I can do better than that.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.170
I can tell you who fired the weapon.

12:17.364 --> 12:18.276
Wrong window.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.080
"R*****

12:20.780 --> 12:23.340
McGee has me babysitting his auctions.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.616
Okay. Victim. Leonard
Caswell. Postal worker.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.976
He was shot at point-blank range
by Robert Perry. His neighbor.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.480
It's kind of funny. Non postal worker
going postal on a postal worker?

12:35.830 --> 12:42.160
Not funny like ha-ha funny, but funny like
comically, absurdly, amusing funny. Like ironic.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.890
Comedy is-is very subjective.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.226
That is a four-year-old
case, Abby.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.716
- You said the weapon was recently used.
- It was.

12:49.740 --> 12:52.706
It just picked up some
experience before that.

12:52.730 --> 12:57.010
Four years ago, the gun was introduced as
evidence in Robert Perry's murder trial.

12:57.060 --> 12:57.996
It was the murder weapon.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.960
Somehow the gun got out of evidence
and into the hands of a 12-year-old.

13:00.990 --> 13:02.530
Who held the evidence?

13:03.280 --> 13:05.190
We did.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.260
It was an NCIS case.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.186
You know, Noah, I got my first merit
badge when I was about your age.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.926
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, do a lot of very cool stuff as a scout.

13:16.950 --> 13:22.300
Camping, tracking... even get
to wear a special uniform.

13:23.610 --> 13:26.086
Uh, you trying to talk him
into or out of it, McGee?

13:26.110 --> 13:28.220
Hey, you poke fun all you want, Tony.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.870
Scouting teaches you skills.

13:30.900 --> 13:35.826
For example, did you kids know that
when something dies in the woods,

13:35.850 --> 13:37.650
it affects animal behavior?

13:38.040 --> 13:39.030
That's right.

13:39.060 --> 13:44.190
Mountain lions, for example, kick up
piles of pine needles to mark their find.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.160
Bears...

13:47.190 --> 13:50.110
will leave their bite marks on trees.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.280
- Hold on.
- What do you got there, McRanger Rick?

13:53.730 --> 13:57.416
Some animals mark their territory
by regurgitating their food.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.136
That's where Zane barfed
when we found the body.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.236
And there's Travis's naked woman!

14:02.260 --> 14:04.820
- Where?
- This way, over here!

14:05.210 --> 14:07.796
- That's where the body is!
- Travis, be careful!

14:07.820 --> 14:10.020
The body's right over here.

14:10.530 --> 14:13.260
It-It... itwashere.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.940
Is anything where you say it is?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.690
Seven Years in Tibet,
and we got nothing.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.340
I wouldn't say nothing.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.590
What is it?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.050
Maggots.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.530
Looks like piece of an ear.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.506
HolyBlue Velvet, McGee.

14:44.530 --> 14:47.300
There was definitely a body here.

14:48.690 --> 14:51.030
Where's the rest of it?

15:00.280 --> 15:02.156
Crime scene's about a quarter
mile from the playground.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.466
Only sign of a victim
we got is, uh... an ear.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.886
- The boys?
- Sent them home.

15:06.910 --> 15:10.656
Daniel McBoone's doing his best tracker thing,
but I think we should send in the cadaver dogs.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.176
Your call. You just
find the body, DiNozzo.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.950
All right.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.520
Body was dragged, then vanished.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.980
Tire tracks.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.490
Body didn't vanish, it was wheeled away.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.650
Tread's pretty narrow.
Kind of waffle-y.

15:29.350 --> 15:32.516
Ziva gets to go home.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.846
We're stuck out here with the maggots.

15:34.870 --> 15:37.110
I love the outdoors.

15:38.140 --> 15:41.350
I checked our evidence log, pulled
the NCIS file on the murder case.

15:41.380 --> 15:42.520
Agent Cassidy's case.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.350
The killer, Robert Perry,
worked for the navy.

15:45.380 --> 15:49.790
He stole the gun from its legal
owner, then used it to commit murder.

15:49.820 --> 15:53.140
After the trial was over
and appeals were exhausted...

15:53.170 --> 15:55.236
Gun was returned to its original owner.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.350
Yes.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.416
To this man, Peter Draper,

15:59.440 --> 16:02.730
who claims that his wife did not want
him to keep a gun associated with murder,

16:02.770 --> 16:05.266
and so he sold it to a pawnshop.

16:05.290 --> 16:06.500
It didn't stay there long.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.986
I finished running
ballistics on the gun.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.450
I matched it to two other
crimes in the last two months.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.300
The gun was fired both times.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.226
Pawnshop owner sold the gun.

16:14.250 --> 16:18.360
Or pawnshop held up two
convenience stores. Unlikely.

16:19.850 --> 16:24.190
Ziva, pull case files from Norfolk
P.D. Find out who bought that gun.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.810
You heard her.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.266
I could get used to this.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.090
Don't.

16:40.940 --> 16:44.420
I thought Scouts helped little
old ladies and sold cookies.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.086
I didn't know they trained
you to track dead bodies.

16:47.110 --> 16:50.400
You learn to read changes
to the terrain, Tony.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.336
Oh, God. Lost the trail on the asphalt.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.170
Oh, really.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.000
Admit defeat, McGee. I'm going
to call 1-800-CADAVER-DOG.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.500
Bird feces.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.856
Birds circling.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.200
You think there's a connection?

17:19.230 --> 17:22.556
Buzzards. Body's not far.

17:22.579 --> 17:25.316
It's probably within about 300 yards.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.440
Tony, we're going to find our body.

17:27.470 --> 17:32.370
I can feel it. I can
smell it. I can see it.

17:38.510 --> 17:42.916
All right, you know what? Call the dogs.
Call the trackers. Call whoever you want.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.870
I'm calling the Rescue Response Team.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.700
No one needs rescuing.

17:46.730 --> 17:50.080
Well, how else are we going to get
that dead body up from down there?

17:58.640 --> 18:01.180
You need to be more observant, McGee.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.510
Did you seeThe Lion King?

18:04.540 --> 18:05.930
Mother loved it.

18:05.970 --> 18:10.700
It's not Mozart or Verdi, but it
does have a certain charm nonetheless.

18:10.730 --> 18:16.180
And you, dear boy, are a prime example
as to why the story resonated with me.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.180
The circle of life.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.380
Well, in your death,
you fed several animals.

18:23.420 --> 18:26.850
Yes, I think it's safe to say that
you made a mammal or two quite happy.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.380
And a whole lot of others miserable.

18:29.790 --> 18:31.676
Dylan Bates.

18:31.700 --> 18:35.456
Criminal record, whole laundry list
of complaints filed against him.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.310
Made a lot of enemies in 19 years.

18:37.370 --> 18:39.060
Including himself.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.640
Based upon the abuse he
inflicted upon his own body.

18:42.700 --> 18:48.706
Vasoconstriction, precancerous spots on his
lungs, scar tissue at the antecubital fossa.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.276
The tox screen will give us specifics,

18:50.300 --> 18:54.520
but I think it's safe to say that
whatever his chosen poisons were,

18:54.560 --> 18:58.350
he was smoking, drinking,
and shooting to excess.

18:58.390 --> 18:59.706
- Not what killed him.
- No.

18:59.730 --> 19:05.140
His attempt to abuse himself to death was
interrupted by a single gunshot to the head.

19:05.170 --> 19:06.010
.38-caliber.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.846
Consistent with the revolver
that your young lad found.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.060
Abby has the bullet.

19:11.090 --> 19:15.580
She also has the maggot larvae
that McGee found at the crime scene.

19:15.610 --> 19:16.410
Time of death?

19:16.450 --> 19:18.400
Taking a liver temp
was out of the question.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.696
- Uh, too much time.
- Well, not enough liver.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.700
I suspect coyotes.

19:22.740 --> 19:25.790
You know, when I was a
child, I used to love liver.

19:25.820 --> 19:28.556
- Mother would cook the liver of almost anything...
- Duck...

19:28.580 --> 19:31.516
Well, that was her favorite.
I preferred calves' liver.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.880
You know, alla Veneziana
with the onions...

19:33.910 --> 19:35.980
- Time of death.
- Time of death. Time of death.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.410
Uh, two, possibly three weeks.

19:38.450 --> 19:43.550
He was exposed to the elements and animals too
long to determine a more precise time of death.

19:44.460 --> 19:50.960
I-I'll be able to narrow it down to within a
24-hour period when the larvae hatch into flies.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.970
Aren't they just the
cutest little things?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.800
That's Bob, that's Norman, that's George.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.506
The wiggly one over here, he's Butch.

20:03.530 --> 20:06.626
And that is Charlie, and Xavier.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.130
They all boys?

20:08.170 --> 20:10.656
Let's hope so. Little
girls can be such a pain.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.890
Well, so can the big ones.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.366
I have more bugs from McGee, Gibbs.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.266
You want to meet the beetles?

20:19.290 --> 20:22.100
I am more interested in the slugs.

20:22.150 --> 20:25.100
Like the one Ducky
pulled from Dylan Bates?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.580
I haven't run the ballistics yet, Gibbs.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.360
I'm starting it now.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.450
I've tested a lot of guns.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.876
But there's something
wicked about this one.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.706
It's like... it's like
possessed or something.

20:36.730 --> 20:37.940
Is something on fire?

20:37.990 --> 20:40.576
No, I'm just burning sage
to take the hex off the gun.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.236
It's got some bad mojo.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.920
And I want to get rid of it
before the babies are born.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.826
It's an evil gun, Gibbs.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.876
This gun... kills people.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.326
Abbs.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.820
I know what you're going to say.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.980
Guns don't kill people,
people kill people.

20:56.010 --> 20:59.260
But this gun... it kills people.

21:00.250 --> 21:05.330
I can find an H-waffle double zigzag waffle; I
can find a double zigzag H-waffle double zigzag,

21:05.360 --> 21:08.656
but not a zigzag
double H-waffle zigzag.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.526
I see a fish riding a unicorn.

21:11.550 --> 21:16.020
Even worse, it's got a tread like a
mini-ATV but a wheelbase like a hand truck.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.520
Still trying to get those clubs, huh?

21:19.560 --> 21:22.946
Yeah, well, every time I'm about to close
in on a set, I end up getting interrupted.

21:22.970 --> 21:24.350
McGee.

21:25.340 --> 21:28.106
Ah, matching up tire impressions
from the crime scene, boss.

21:28.130 --> 21:30.400
Ziva, tough time at the pawnshop?

21:30.780 --> 21:32.886
- I hit a stone wall.
- Brick wall.

21:32.910 --> 21:35.716
No, it was a stone wall.
I backed up too quickly.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.020
I found the record of the sale.

21:37.050 --> 21:40.680
The gun was sold to a man by
the name of... Eddie Felson.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.920
Fast Eddie Felson?

21:43.950 --> 21:45.640
You know him?

21:45.670 --> 21:50.136
Well, yeah. Former pool player
forced into retirement by gangsters.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.140
He was a con man, he was a boozer.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.340
He was a character Paul
Newman played inThe Hustler.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.890
And his hair was perfect.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.800
Apparently, the gun was, um, bought
by using a false identity.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.620
Case files, Norfolk P.D.?

22:05.070 --> 22:08.420
Two unsolved robberies. Five suspects.

22:10.610 --> 22:16.086
One, duo, tres, cuatro... Uh, five.

22:16.110 --> 22:18.710
Name does not match any of our suspects.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.950
No, but the face does.

22:23.550 --> 22:28.146
Morning, Ronald. Ronnie. Ron. Fast Eddie.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.546
Recognize this bad boy?

22:30.570 --> 22:36.926
You should. You bought it, then you used it
once at a Kwik Stop, then again at an E-Z Mart.

22:36.950 --> 22:40.006
Slugs you left as
souvenirs match the gun.

22:40.030 --> 22:42.090
Case loads must be light.

22:42.130 --> 22:44.760
I didn't think you guys
bothered with small-time crooks.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.680
Only when they become
big-time murderers.

22:48.930 --> 22:54.010
We found a slug from that
same gun in Dylan Bates.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.480
Finally got what he deserved.

22:59.830 --> 23:01.066
Wasn't me.

23:01.090 --> 23:02.136
You knew him?

23:02.160 --> 23:04.700
You couldn't drive through Norfolk
without knowing Dylan Bates.

23:04.730 --> 23:07.186
The guy was like a
one-man menace to society.

23:07.210 --> 23:08.950
He menace you?

23:09.260 --> 23:11.730
He stole my car and my girlfriend.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.710
Nice car?

23:17.730 --> 23:20.426
That gives you a motive,
and a murder weapon.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.250
I wouldn't waste a bullet on Bates.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.150
Okay, why don't you save it for the jury?

23:24.190 --> 23:27.610
I'm sure they'll be just as moved
by your touching story as we were.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.640
Wait.

23:39.730 --> 23:42.620
I hit those convenience stores, okay?

23:43.350 --> 23:46.236
But I'm not going down for some
murder that I didn't commit.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.500
And we should believe you because...

23:51.500 --> 23:53.560
Because I ditched the gun a month ago.

23:53.590 --> 23:55.316
Where?

23:55.340 --> 23:59.030
A Dumpster behind a
Safeway on-on West Franklin.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.476
Hold on. There's our Fast Eddie.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.430
Dates and time match up with when
he claims to have ditched the gun.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.380
He may be tossing it right there.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.130
Keep going.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.030
Hold on.

24:22.150 --> 24:25.130
- Something got his attention.
- Zoom it in.

24:27.670 --> 24:29.970
Let's see what Chicken Man's up to.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.290
Find Joey.

24:45.870 --> 24:48.310
- Abbs? Music?
- I know.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.820
I can barely stand it.

24:50.860 --> 24:54.550
I can't focus, it's affecting my
cognitive function, I'm getting agitated.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.780
It's not for me, it's for them.

24:56.810 --> 25:02.016
Playing classical music for babies is supposed
to increase their spatio-temporal reasoning

25:02.040 --> 25:04.580
and increase intelligence.

25:06.120 --> 25:10.050
If I keep listening to this, I'm
going to turn into a psycho killer.

25:17.910 --> 25:20.670
Abbs? Our killer?

25:22.900 --> 25:28.600
The slug that Ducky pulled from Dylan
Bates' body matches the gun, but...

25:29.550 --> 25:34.076
the brain matter on the tip of
the gun does not match Bates.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.406
- Which means...
- There's a second victim.

25:36.430 --> 25:40.680
Gibbs, that gun... it's bad news.

25:53.730 --> 25:55.206
We've got a second victim.

25:55.230 --> 25:57.316
DNA on the gun didn't match Bates.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.660
And I'll contact local LEOs.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.566
Maybe they already found
our missing murder victim.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.620
We talked to the manager
at the Chirping Chicken.

26:02.650 --> 26:07.186
He wouldn't divulge the secret recipe,
but he did identify our Dumpster-diver.

26:07.210 --> 26:10.816
Joseph K. Ellis, aka Joey.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.376
Hasn't show up for work for two weeks.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.976
- McGee.
- Joseph K. Ellis.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.490
Navy brat. Spent the majority
of his childhood at Norfolk.

26:19.830 --> 26:23.240
Recently tried to enlist in the
navy himself, but was denied.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.456
- And here's why.
- Criminal record.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.926
Charged with armed
robbery as a juvenile.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.980
And he had an accomplice.

26:31.010 --> 26:33.506
- Dylan Bates.
- Our neighborhood bully.

26:33.530 --> 26:35.456
Our bad penny.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.650
Bring in Ellis.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.620
That's it!

26:44.970 --> 26:47.350
Guys, I have...

26:51.530 --> 26:53.640
got a match.

26:57.090 --> 27:01.370
So, what, McGee? Is there
a, um, wagon derby in town?

27:01.740 --> 27:03.016
Abby, these aren't just any wagons.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.260
These are Wagon-Boy
All-Terrain wagons.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.736
Look at the size of those wheels.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.380
Bigger isn't always better, McGee.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.386
- Those are cool tires.
- Yeah.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.886
Yeah, you see the, uh...

27:15.910 --> 27:19.506
the zigzag double H waffle
zigzag tread on those tires?

27:19.530 --> 27:21.910
It's a Wagon-Boy exclusive.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.520
McGee, you're like a
little kid on Christmas.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.540
I canvassed the base housing at Norfolk.

27:26.580 --> 27:28.180
Collected as many as I could find.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.866
Doesn't seem to be any
obvious signs of blood.

27:30.890 --> 27:33.360
Well, let's check for the not so obvious.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.800
Let's.

27:39.350 --> 27:41.886
You know, I always wanted one of these.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.870
- What, you never had a wagon?
- Nope. We had a tortoise.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.146
Okay.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.000
We used to ride Herman everywhere.

27:51.040 --> 27:55.810
Well, except to Grammy Sciuto's house,
because he ate her prize-winning petunias.

27:55.850 --> 27:58.760
Dad always said that we could
get a wagon after Herman died.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.550
But those tortoises...
They live, like, forever.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.170
So, whose wagon is it, McGee?

28:18.370 --> 28:21.110
The one who is not getting theirs back.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.136
He doesn't know I'm here?

28:26.160 --> 28:28.000
No.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.486
- Hey, Noah.
- Not thirsty.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.720
Well, it's not for you.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.400
Orange.

28:41.870 --> 28:43.776
You remember, Agent Gibbs.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.886
I remember what's important.

28:45.910 --> 28:47.770
Noah?

28:49.010 --> 28:52.036
You understand you are
not under arrest here.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.986
This is just an interview.

28:54.010 --> 28:57.930
You don't have to answer any
questions. Do you understand?

29:00.160 --> 29:03.320
Okay. Agent Gibbs?

29:07.400 --> 29:11.350
So, Noah, do you know what forensics are?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.910
Fingerprints and stuff.

29:17.470 --> 29:19.660
Yeah, an example, uh...

29:20.580 --> 29:23.670
we found your
fingerprints on your wagon.

29:24.550 --> 29:27.556
It's no big deal. It's your wagon.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.120
Yeah, but we also found some other stuff.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.410
Found blood that matches
the body you found.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.320
You know what that means?

29:44.850 --> 29:47.590
Noah, it means you lied to me.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.450
You remember at first when you didn't
tell me the truth about the body?

29:57.620 --> 30:00.180
You remember how I found out?

30:01.850 --> 30:04.340
I will get the truth.

30:06.550 --> 30:12.160
The thing is, the longer it takes,
the farther away the killer gets.

30:16.110 --> 30:19.130
Who are you trying to protect?

30:22.180 --> 30:24.920
- We're going to take a break here.
- No!

30:32.720 --> 30:36.120
I killed him. I did it. It was me.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.346
Why would you do that?

30:39.370 --> 30:42.210
He picked on me and my friends.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.406
He beat us up, he stole our money.

30:45.430 --> 30:47.640
Somebody had to stand up to him!

30:47.670 --> 30:49.680
Where'd you get the gun?

30:50.160 --> 30:52.250
- I found it.
- Where?

30:54.500 --> 30:55.920
I don't remember.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.840
Do you rember what Dylan
said just before you shot him?

31:02.720 --> 31:05.340
People always say something.

31:05.770 --> 31:07.630
"Don't shoot!"

31:16.230 --> 31:18.430
What did Dylan say?

31:22.780 --> 31:25.010
I don't remember.

31:27.090 --> 31:29.550
I don't believe you.

31:30.170 --> 31:32.710
You don't forget something like that.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.610
You must really love whoever
it is you're trying to protect.

31:42.500 --> 31:47.070
But I can't help them
unless you tell me who it is.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.790
He did it to protect me.

32:00.350 --> 32:03.250
It... It was my dad.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.120
My dad killed him.

32:19.810 --> 32:21.790
Come on, baby!

32:22.240 --> 32:26.586
Push! That's right, come on. Squeeze!

32:26.610 --> 32:29.670
Ducky, it's happening. Look!

32:32.940 --> 32:34.030
I think it's a boy.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.610
Ah, the miracle of birth.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.460
Okay...

32:42.790 --> 32:45.660
Gently. Got him.

32:46.020 --> 32:47.620
Okay.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.490
Hold "George."

32:53.050 --> 32:54.550
Hello, George.

32:54.580 --> 32:58.316
Their first baby
pictures. All right. Smile.

32:58.340 --> 33:01.370
- I am smiling.
- No, George.

33:02.980 --> 33:06.090
I think it's a variety of Calliphoridae.

33:09.470 --> 33:12.470
You might want to
rename George "Georgina."

33:12.500 --> 33:15.400
Well, as long as they're healthy.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.120
You were right, Ducky. Blow-fly.

33:21.070 --> 33:23.596
Phormia regina.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.870
I like that.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.660
Welcome to the world, Regina.

33:30.030 --> 33:32.750
You did not care much for Dylan Bates.

33:32.790 --> 33:35.516
Nobody did. Kid was bad news.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.696
Your son says you killed him.

33:37.720 --> 33:42.190
He was so scared you'd be arrested,
he tried to cover up your crime.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.390
Yeah, when that didn't
work, he took credit for it.

33:45.810 --> 33:49.300
You're basing your investigation
on the word of a 12-year-old kid.

33:49.330 --> 33:52.516
He overheard you threaten Dylan Bates.

33:52.540 --> 33:54.830
Two weeks before he was found murdered.

33:54.860 --> 33:59.236
"You touch a hair "on my son, I
will hunt you down and kill you."

33:59.260 --> 34:01.740
Strong words.

34:02.130 --> 34:05.626
Yeah, okay. So, I threatened him, yeah.

34:05.650 --> 34:08.656
You a man of your word, Mike?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.906
Noah thinks you are.

34:10.929 --> 34:13.496
He thinks you'll protect him.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.659
Whatever it takes.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.846
You don't know what it's like.

34:17.870 --> 34:21.550
Going off to the other side of
the world to protect your country.

34:21.820 --> 34:25.255
But then you can't be there
to protect your own family.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.980
You want to protect your family?

34:27.010 --> 34:29.070
You tell the truth.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.186
Did you kill him?

34:31.210 --> 34:34.170
He was a bully. He had it coming.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.389
But I didn't do it.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.080
Why'd you leave town so quick?

34:41.239 --> 34:43.030
Scheduled to deploy.

34:43.070 --> 34:46.929
No, you were scheduled to deploy in May.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.830
You requested an
earlier deployment. Why?

34:53.820 --> 34:55.980
Family needed the money, okay?

34:57.100 --> 34:59.240
So, I moved up to take a Haz-Duty slot.

34:59.270 --> 35:01.820
Prison's pretty hazardous, too, Mike.

35:02.050 --> 35:06.636
You know, if I killed somebody, I'd want to get
as far away from the investigation as I could.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.780
You got pretty far, pretty fast.

35:08.810 --> 35:10.930
Stand by, Commander.

35:16.540 --> 35:17.610
They've hatched.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.590
We were able tabulate the
post-mortem time interval.

35:20.620 --> 35:24.006
Bates was shot and killed 15 days ago.

35:24.030 --> 35:27.690
Yeah, well, that's three days after
Commander Taffet deployed to Iraq.

35:27.740 --> 35:31.690
I'm afraid you'll have to hatch a new
theory as to who killed Dylan Bates.

35:34.510 --> 35:36.046
DiNozzo.

35:36.070 --> 35:37.150
Oh, hey, Boss.

35:37.190 --> 35:39.530
Uh, no luck tracking down Chicken Man.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.946
Joey Ellis, the Dumpster diver.

35:43.970 --> 35:45.380
Not answering his cell phone.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.910
And no one's at his apartment.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.650
Waiting on a warrant, but the
car's nowhere to be found.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.710
Coworkers have not
seen him in two weeks.

35:51.740 --> 35:54.906
Looks like he murdered Dylan Bates and
someone else, and then skipped town.

35:54.930 --> 35:56.580
Just spoke with Ellis's mother.

35:56.620 --> 36:00.610
She's got a house on base but has
been deployed overseas in Yokohama.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.846
Hasn't spoken to her
son in nearly a month.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.386
- Father?
- Died in combat when Ellis was a child.

36:05.410 --> 36:06.636
Second victim, McGee?

36:06.660 --> 36:07.706
Checked with Norfolk P.D.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.926
No unsolved murders with victims,
shot in the head in the last month.

36:10.950 --> 36:14.516
Now, I've also tried to match the
DNA taken from the brain matter

36:14.540 --> 36:17.626
found on the gun with DNA
collected for missing persons.

36:17.650 --> 36:18.510
Long shot.

36:18.550 --> 36:20.410
Yeah, could take a couple weeks.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.706
Dig deeper into Ellis's history.

36:22.730 --> 36:25.760
Until otherwise, he's our primary.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.410
A local base resident gave us this.

36:30.950 --> 36:35.310
Bates and Ellis obviously knew each other
for years before something came between them.

36:35.630 --> 36:38.070
Hey, boss? Found something here.

36:38.410 --> 36:42.680
Joey's mother has been deployed for the past
three months, but according to her phone records,

36:42.710 --> 36:46.776
there were outgoing calls made from her
house as recently as a couple weeks ago.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.030
DiNozzo, Ziva... Norfolk, go.

37:05.910 --> 37:08.640
Come on, Scout boy. You're with me.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.400
You smell what I smell?

37:31.530 --> 37:34.656
I'm sorry, you can't talk to
him. He's upset. He's had enough.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.850
We're not here to see Noah.

37:37.310 --> 37:40.100
Is your daughter Rebecca home?

37:59.420 --> 38:00.990
Clear.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.680
Found Joey Ellis, boss.

38:23.710 --> 38:27.370
Looks and smells like
he's been dead for a while.

38:27.990 --> 38:29.920
Gunshot, left temple.

38:30.490 --> 38:32.276
Yeah, how'd you know that?

38:32.300 --> 38:34.416
Yearbook, he's a southpaw.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.400
What difference does that
make if he was murdered?

38:36.430 --> 38:39.710
Not murder. Suicide.

38:43.180 --> 38:45.376
There's no gun here, boss.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.710
Didn't expect one.

38:53.440 --> 38:56.056
You got something you want
to tell me about Joey Ellis?

38:56.080 --> 38:58.270
Joey Ellis?

39:01.830 --> 39:04.330
Yeah, he's dead.

39:07.330 --> 39:09.570
Joey's dead?

39:10.930 --> 39:14.070
You found his body
after he killed himself?

39:17.060 --> 39:19.730
He was my best friend.

39:21.540 --> 39:24.420
Dylan tortured Joey all his life.

39:24.910 --> 39:29.160
Got him into drugs, convinced
him to commit that robbery.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.756
He didn't even want to do it.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.920
So stupid.

39:34.430 --> 39:37.360
That's what prevented Joey
from getting into the navy.

39:39.370 --> 39:43.206
Dylan ruined Joey's life and
threw it back in his face.

39:43.230 --> 39:46.520
Taunted him about it.
Made fun of him every day.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.626
Joey couldn't take it anymore.

39:48.650 --> 39:52.550
I tried to talk to him about it,
but he couldn't see a way out.

40:08.330 --> 40:11.370
You blame Dylan for Joey's suicide?

40:14.100 --> 40:18.556
So you took the gun, decided to do
what Joey couldn't bring himself to do.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.050
You killed Dylan Bates.

40:20.100 --> 40:23.656
No. I just wanted him
to know what he had done.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.836
I wanted to show him.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.746
This is the gun Joey
used to kill himself.

40:28.770 --> 40:32.320
He tried to grab it. It just went off.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.610
- Rebecca...
- I'm so sorry, Mommy.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.080
Oh, honey...

40:46.830 --> 40:49.506
Why is it always the case that
when two people struggle over a gun,

40:49.530 --> 40:51.656
one person never shoots the other?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.910
The gun miraculously just goes off?

40:54.950 --> 40:57.840
Abby said it was an evil gun.

40:58.170 --> 41:02.336
Legal said Rebecca Taffet's got a pretty
strong case for involuntary manslaughter.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.030
Yeah, well, she'll need a good lawyer.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.900
It's taken care of. Travis's
mother is gonna represent her.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.380
Was she the mom you were hot for?

41:10.690 --> 41:12.956
- Tony?
- In a sec.

41:12.980 --> 41:18.580
Securely hidden in the shadows, the cunning marksman
waits patiently for the perfect time to strike.

41:27.170 --> 41:31.146
You are looking at the
proud owner of a vintage set

41:31.170 --> 41:35.150
of Robert Forgan handcrafted
mint condition golf clubs.

41:35.210 --> 41:36.190
That's impossible.

41:36.220 --> 41:39.196
No, nothing is impossible.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.570
I'm a sniper.

41:40.610 --> 41:42.430
Same exact set Ducky had?

41:42.470 --> 41:43.990
1,200 for the clubs.

41:44.020 --> 41:48.206
Um, let's say a 100-dollar
finder's fee, McGee.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.590
Except Ducky's a righty.

41:52.950 --> 41:55.470
These are left-handed clubs, Tony.

41:55.870 --> 41:59.120
- You just wasted 1,200 bucks.
- No...

41:59.300 --> 42:01.020
left handed.

42:02.790 --> 42:05.250
Maybe Ducky swings both ways?

42:05.790 --> 42:07.666
A thousand bucks, and they're yours.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.766
Why would I buy a set of
clubs that Ducky could not use?

42:10.790 --> 42:13.196
Why? Oh, gee, let me think.

42:13.220 --> 42:15.470
I don't know, maybe because
if you don't buy them,

42:15.510 --> 42:18.150
I will tell Ducky that you
destroyed his one-of-a-kind,

42:18.190 --> 42:21.696
handcrafted hickory-shafted,
vintage golf clubs.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.040
I think you just did.

42:31.790 --> 42:34.440
Let's call it even, Timothy.

42:34.910 --> 42:39.980
That jazz guitar album
that I borrowed from you?

42:40.580 --> 42:43.650
My original vinyl pressing of
Django Reinhardt's Crazy Rhythms?

42:43.680 --> 42:45.470
Yeah, you were right.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.446
It was unique, it was original.

42:48.470 --> 42:50.550
It was autographed.

42:50.580 --> 42:52.810
What happened to it?

42:53.480 --> 42:55.530
Good question.
