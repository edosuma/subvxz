WEBVTT

01:06.524 --> 01:07.734
Right.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.615
Tam! Tam, are you there?

01:14.449 --> 01:15.867
It's just me!

01:17.035 --> 01:18.036
Can you move?

01:18.745 --> 01:19.954
I'm stuck.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.665
It's the restraints.
Sand's jammed them up.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.632
-Whoa!

01:32.133 --> 01:35.553
Listen to me. I need you
to toss me your knife, okay?

01:36.137 --> 01:39.098
It's the only one we got.
So don't drop it.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.391
What happened to yours?

01:41.351 --> 01:42.185
I dropped it.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.480
Okay, I'm ready.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.358
-Reach for your knife. You got this.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.734
Come on.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.780
Okay. Toss it.

01:54.072 --> 01:54.906
Yes!

01:56.741 --> 01:59.911
Lucky for you, I'm the person
you'd most want to be stranded with

01:59.994 --> 02:01.579
in an emergency situation.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.958
You know what I love about these ships
when they break in half?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.503
They spill oil everywhere.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.804
Oh!

02:18.388 --> 02:20.932
-It worked! I'm coming to get you.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.560
-Come on, hurry!

02:36.239 --> 02:37.615
-Aah! Hold on!

02:44.539 --> 02:45.373
Come on!

02:45.582 --> 02:47.083
Come on.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.258
-Okay. All right. Okay.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.679
-Whoa!

03:00.722 --> 03:02.682
-Oh!

03:02.765 --> 03:04.726
Try to climb out of here without moving.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.119
All right. Here.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.039
Push!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.150
It's okay, Mom.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.660
I knew we weren't alone.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.832
It's... It's synthetic. It's...

04:12.460 --> 04:14.504
It's built, not born.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.881
We still make the history books
for first contact,

04:16.965 --> 04:18.883
even if it's a robot, right?

04:18.967 --> 04:22.345
"We"? You only get to be famous
for being related to me.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.180
Do you have a name?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.726
Do you know where we are?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.437
-He's not from here.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.939
I saw his spaceship.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.025
You did?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.986
I think he crashed when we did.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.699
-I think he's all alone.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.702
Or else he wouldn't have needed me
to help him.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.453
You helped it?

04:47.829 --> 04:48.830
He was hurt.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.501
Now it's helping you.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.810
He's going down to the Jupiter.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.938
I was gonna suggest it do that.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.025
I was just waiting for a break
in the conversation.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.862
Hey... how'd this happen?

05:22.280 --> 05:26.326
Uh, I don't know.
I guess it happened when I fell.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.884
-I don't suppose you have a toolbox.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.179
'Cause you can fix this
and get us out of here?

05:46.679 --> 05:49.140
Yeah, I'll let you in on a trade secret.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.852
The answer to the question
"Can you fix this?" is always "Yes."

05:52.935 --> 05:54.020
Even if you can't?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.646
Especially if you can't.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.815
Then you just add
that you gotta find the right tool.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.318
So you're gonna bullshit
our way to safety.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.904
Yep. Just need to find the right tool.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.655
Oh.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.514
Don't get sentimental.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.100
I'm not carrying your bag
when it gets too heavy.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.146
Oh, hello.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.150
My necklace!

06:42.902 --> 06:44.320
It must have fallen off.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.405
You're welcome.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
It's not that heavy.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.747
Tam!

06:55.331 --> 06:56.457
Tam!

06:57.583 --> 06:59.669
Doc! Doc, get over here.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.425
I'm not that kind of doctor.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.511
Doesn't matter.

07:15.893 --> 07:20.440
Stealing her boots?
I thought you two were friends.

07:20.523 --> 07:25.027
She would've done the same.
That's why we got along so well.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.785
Somebody ought to show
some basic human decency.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.328
Bury her if you want, Doc.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.831
I'm gonna try to make sure
nobody has to bury us.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.672
Hope someone's having a better day
than we are.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
I wish Dad would hurry up
so we can get down there.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.427
It's not so bad up here.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.977
Let's agree that was just wind.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.569
<i>Main deck water level reduced to 1%.</i>

08:54.742 --> 08:57.620
<i>Lower deck water level reduced to 60%.</i>

09:11.634 --> 09:14.387
Oh, come on, you stupid thing.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.605
<i>Main deck water level reduced to 1%.</i>

09:49.171 --> 09:50.715
What the hell are you?

10:01.684 --> 10:05.229
-Maybe we should shoot off another flare.
-We already wasted one.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.235
There's no one out there.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.993
Wait!

10:20.119 --> 10:23.581
-Looks like someone ejected.
-Maybe they can help us.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.166
Let's ask.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.465
Put those on.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.717
I'm not wearing those.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.140
This sand... is sharp as diamonds.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.267
Might even be diamonds.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.562
It's gonna tear through your soles.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.108
Thanks.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.074
-You remind me of someone.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.617
Best lover you ever had?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.245
My brother.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.418
Just don't want you slowing me down.
You ready?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.254
Lead the way.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.638
Oh, God.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.182
-All right, all right. Stop staring at me.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.893
Let's go. No chicken left behind.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.190
If we find a cow, you carry it.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.507
I'm gonna go get the leg brace
from the printer.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.967
It's okay to lie down, you know.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.220
No, I'm fine.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.561
<i>Penny, how are</i>
<i>we coming along with those filters?</i>

12:11.397 --> 12:13.482
The starboard side's almost finished.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.776
<i>Pick up the pace, please.</i>

12:33.961 --> 12:35.337
Your robot's creepy.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.548
You'll get used to him.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.720
<i> Penny, go up top.</i>

12:42.803 --> 12:46.140
<i>The hose is freezing over again.</i>
<i>You can finish the filters later.</i>

12:48.517 --> 12:49.727
Okay, Dad.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.249
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.877
Uh, I heard it ding.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.086
Thanks.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.214
You had a tough day.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.591
How you holding up?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.136
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.223
Yeah? Okay.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.818
Hey.

13:44.448 --> 13:47.576
I... just...

13:48.744 --> 13:51.080
I just wanted to say, um...

14:01.590 --> 14:02.633
thank you.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.489
You have to lift a little bit.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.414
Okay.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.500
This will do most of the work
until your leg's healed.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.129
Let's try it out.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.101
Fantastic!

14:54.685 --> 14:56.186
What is that...

14:56.270 --> 14:58.731
<i>Penny, why haven't you </i>
<i>finished the filters?</i>

14:58.814 --> 15:00.316
<i>I can still smell ozone.</i>

15:00.399 --> 15:03.527
-Dad said I should be cleaning--
<i>-I'd like to breathe.</i>

15:13.662 --> 15:15.956
<i>Penny, we're gonna burn out the motor.</i>

15:18.459 --> 15:21.337
But Mom said that I should
fix the filters right now.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.838
<i>It can wait.</i>

15:41.565 --> 15:44.944
Mom, Dad, you might wanna come
take a look at this.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.824
Hey.
So that explosion Penny saw

15:50.908 --> 15:53.369
was definitely a reserve tank
of another Jupiter.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.496
Let's hope there are survivors.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.289
Are you coming

16:00.501 --> 16:02.211
The girls did excellent work.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.966
Listen, I think it's important

16:07.758 --> 16:10.636
that they all hear us speaking
with one voice.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.889
-Couldn't agree more.
-That voice is mine.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.557
Great.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.494
It's been a while.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.164
Yeah.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.333
We're gonna look for survivors.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.419
Get your gear. You're coming along.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.713
Does Mom know?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.465
Just get your gear.

16:53.637 --> 16:57.224
Girls, while your dad and I are gone,
you're gonna help free the Jupiter.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.687
If we don't work our way out gently,
we could make the ice unstable.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.773
Worst case scenario,
the ice could crush our ship.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.691
Understood.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.943
So, we'll use the maneuvering rockets,

17:08.027 --> 17:11.405
melt the ice to water,
and just float up inch by inch.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.781
Okay.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.784
20% power, ten minute intervals,
ten second burn.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.745
Twenty, ten, ten.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.956
By this time tomorrow,
our ship should be clear.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.459
And then what?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.252
Feet off the console.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.693
"The print model you've requested
does not meet colony safety protocol.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.698
For assistance, dial 874628 to speak
with your district representative."

17:56.575 --> 17:59.119
Yeah, well,
I'm not at the colony, asshole.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.957
I was hoping you'd
left this thing back on Earth.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.794
Leave my lucky whiteboard

18:07.711 --> 18:09.797
Okay, see if you can finish these
while we're gone.

18:20.682 --> 18:25.270
So, if the sun rises in the east
and sets to the west...

18:37.407 --> 18:40.452
I don't wanna let it out of my sight.
And you don't get one without the other.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.289
You see, this is one of the things
we might have discussed.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.874
We can discuss it.

18:47.709 --> 18:51.713
No. It's fine. I'm not worried about Will.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.759
The Jupiter's here...

18:58.137 --> 18:59.471
You trust that thing?

19:01.431 --> 19:06.228
It brought Will back safe,
saved Judy from suffocating under the ice.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.522
It's the kind of behavior
that builds trust.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.357
Come on!

19:11.900 --> 19:14.069
Come on. Let's go.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.770
Just what kind of doctor are you, anyway?

19:52.941 --> 19:55.319
-I'm a psychologist.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.738
I can't believe people
pay people for that.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.909
Actually, they do. A lot.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.578
All you have to do is look at a person

20:04.661 --> 20:07.289
to know what their deal is
within five minutes of meeting them.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.124
You think it's that easy?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.920
Like you, for example.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.048
Take that necklace.
That's a Saint Christopher medal.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.217
He's supposed to watch over you,
keep you safe.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.679
Personally, I look out for myself.
And I've never met no saint.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.224
But you, you're not so different.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.892
You're a Ph.D. or something,

20:26.975 --> 20:29.269
which makes me think
you don't believe in that junk either.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.104
Why do you wear it?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.940
Must be another reason.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.402
Perhaps it has something to do
with that brother I remind you of.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.906
It's none of your business.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.159
So it is your brother. See, that wasn't that hard.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.498
And hey, I'll charge you half
of what you'd charge me.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.668
-I know.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.477
I didn't think we'd be the ones
rescuing people.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.021
We're not.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.818
All due respect, Angela,
this is nothing personal.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.825
-Oh! What the...

21:25.367 --> 21:26.868
You didn't check her pulse?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.204
Hey, you're not a real doctor either.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.709
So now what?

22:17.127 --> 22:20.172
So familiar, but what is it?
It's on the tip of your tongue.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.673
I'm not playing this, Penny.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.593
I'm sorry, Jude.
That's just the way the cookie crumbles.

22:26.928 --> 22:32.225
"That's just the way the cookie crumbles."
I could not have made it more obvious.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.478
Where did you get those?

22:34.561 --> 22:38.857
So, you are interested in the only Oreos
in a hundred trillion miles?

22:38.940 --> 22:42.736
You spent 14.3 ounces of your personal
weight allocation on that?

22:42.819 --> 22:44.696
No. Mom did.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.406
It's the last item on her checklist.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.659
"Retrieve the blue object
from locker 24A."

22:49.743 --> 22:52.412
It was this or another pack
of air filters. I made the call.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.580
What are you doing?

22:53.872 --> 22:56.875
Having it be the last item on the list
indicates it's a reward for finishing.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.212
-No, you have to wait for everyone.
-I'm going in.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.923
Sure.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.552
Pump's clogged again.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.223
Can we trade off?

23:23.193 --> 23:24.903
This was the <i>Jupiter 17.</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:28.240
Did you know anyone on it?
No, honey.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.910
That could have been us.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.998
Well, it wasn't.

23:54.307 --> 23:58.353
Aah, I swear to God, every time
I come up here it's something worse.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.943
Mom, Dad, come in.
Do you read me? Over.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.820
They're out of range.

24:07.821 --> 24:11.408
In the valley, they're not gonna
see that storm until it's directly above.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.371
-We have to do something.
-Think it through.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.665
What pace would we need to maintain
to hike down to them

24:21.793 --> 24:23.587
It's in the garage,
buried under a ton of ice.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.839
-We have to get it out!

24:26.381 --> 24:28.800
I was specifically told
to go easy on the engines

24:28.884 --> 24:31.344
so the ice wouldn't become unstable
and crush our ship!

24:31.428 --> 24:35.140
-Mom, Dad, and Will--
-Can take care of themselves.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.517
Now stop panicking.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.830
Penny!

25:19.017 --> 25:23.146
-Somebody had to do something.

25:38.161 --> 25:38.995
See?

25:46.795 --> 25:48.713
Come on. You don't even have your license.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.549
That's why you're gonna drive.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.854
You've got to be kidding me.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.190
Let it go, Penny.

26:14.364 --> 26:17.576
This is Maureen Robinson
from the<i> Jupiter 2.</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:20.662
We're at the crash site of the<i> Jupiter 17.</i>

26:21.121 --> 26:22.872
We've found no survivors.

26:23.498 --> 26:26.960
If there are any other search parties
in the area, please respond.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.631
-No.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.760
-This is Maureen--

26:40.515 --> 26:41.516
You heard that before?

26:43.560 --> 26:44.394
Yeah.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.440
It was coming from the crashed ship.
His crashed ship.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.861
-It must be somewhere close.
-It's a long walk back.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.905
Ask if it knows where its ship is.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.619
Do you know where your spaceship is?

27:05.373 --> 27:08.376
I don't think he remembers anything
from before.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.461
Before what?

27:10.378 --> 27:13.548
Before he got hurt.
I told you, he got hurt.

27:13.631 --> 27:14.966
But it remembers you.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.052
So it must remember where it met you.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.262
Let's not push our luck.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.056
There's so much we don't know yet.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.475
We need to take this opportunity
to find out.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.935
When you don't know,
that's when you go home.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.439
We're heading back to the Jupiter.
Come on.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.441
Will, since when do you not do what I ask?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.285
Can you take us to where we met?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.084
Oh, great.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.460
Sorry.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.381
You know you want to go as much as I do.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.258
Not with an 11-year-old kid
and a gimpy wife.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.635
I'm not!

27:58.718 --> 27:59.886
What

28:10.688 --> 28:13.233
That's probably the Jupiter
where she ejected from.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.777
Maybe there's someone there
who's a little more conscious.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.540
We gotta move.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.878
What do you think she weighs?

28:34.379 --> 28:37.090
No, there's no way I can carry her.
She'll just slow us down.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.970
That's it. That's what we're doing.
We leave her.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.432
-We have no choice.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.268
I suppose you're right.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.231
Oh, hell.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.359
I'm no humanitarian.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.326
Yeah. Sure.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.619
Think whatever you want.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.789
You know what the bonus is
for a guy like me for saving you two?

29:09.873 --> 29:11.207
A house in Malibu.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.252
Weather's not what it used to be,
but the margaritas are just as good.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.505
Who's gonna pay you out here?

29:20.091 --> 29:24.679
You put on a good show
of being completely self-interested,

29:26.014 --> 29:27.974
but I know you're a good person.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.603
Look how you saved this chicken.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.856
Ask the chicken if I'm a good guy
come dinnertime.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.003
<i>Judy? The Chariot's ready.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

31:11.411 --> 31:12.287
Penny!

31:17.500 --> 31:18.751
Penny!

31:32.473 --> 31:33.975
This is really not too bad.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.039
No.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.382
Mom Are you there?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.761
Uh, yeah, this is your daughter.

32:09.844 --> 32:13.389
The one who really doesn't want to
drive the Chariot off a cliff right now.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.850
So if you're there, please come in.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.003
<i> Engaging winter mode.</i>

32:46.005 --> 32:50.176
Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

32:51.427 --> 32:54.347
Mm-hmm. Just like bumper cars.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.392
Where everybody dies.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.451
Maybe it's time for a flare.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.055
What if we're the only survivors?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.142
There must be someone out there.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.311
-We only have one flare left.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.030
I can fix that for you.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.743
No, thanks.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.748
Your brother give it to you?
The one I remind you of?

34:04.083 --> 34:05.710
I put two and two together.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.593
It reminds me of him.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.722
It must have been hard
leaving him back on Earth.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.224
He left first.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.560
Car wreck.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.646
Sorry.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.691
Should have bought two.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.236
Storm's getting closer.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.156
How far can you get with her?

34:55.885 --> 34:58.429
In a day of firsts, this wins.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.277
Will, stay outside.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.533
What the...

36:04.203 --> 36:05.371
You're hovering.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.875
Tough seed to survive that fire.

36:53.794 --> 36:55.504
I'm gonna add it to my collection.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.761
How'd that get in there?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.352
Catch.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.361
Here.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.905
Open your hand. Hold on to it.

37:25.826 --> 37:27.119
Throw it back.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.541
Gently. Nice.

37:42.969 --> 37:46.305
This isn't weird. This isn't weird at all.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.016
Nice throw.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.227
Yeah!

38:01.404 --> 38:03.364
I always wanted him to come back.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.954
But... now that he's here...

38:14.834 --> 38:16.711
You probably don't know what a dad is.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.731
Oh!
John?

38:38.482 --> 38:39.942
Did you touch something?

38:40.026 --> 38:42.653
-No.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.264
That's where we are.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.152
It's a map.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.112
Good. We need one.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.135
I thought the Milky Way
looked different from this.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.596
It does.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.433
So what galaxy is this?

40:05.152 --> 40:07.113
How the hell did <i>The Resolute</i> get us here?

40:08.197 --> 40:11.617
It's impossible,
according to every law of physics.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.660
Uh-huh.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.664
Maybe someone wrote some new ones.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.692
No. No.

41:13.971 --> 41:14.930
Was that you?

41:17.558 --> 41:19.310
Why did you attack us?

41:20.895 --> 41:22.229
Tell me!

41:26.942 --> 41:28.277
You really don't remember?

41:33.991 --> 41:38.287
But you're not like that anymore.
You're not... You're not like that.

41:39.955 --> 41:40.789
Are you?

41:50.090 --> 41:51.509
Raise your left hand.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.850
Now... Now raise your right.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.193
Turn around.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.829
Walk forward.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.958
No. Wait!

42:25.751 --> 42:27.127
Come back.

43:04.832 --> 43:08.627
Come on, hurry up. Get in. Get in.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.518
My necklace.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.397
I had it a minute ago.
It must've fallen off.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.291
Here.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.253
You should let me fix that for you.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.591
Fix it while I'm gone.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.510
Gone?

43:59.219 --> 44:03.265
I know you won't leave her,
because you're a good man.

44:03.349 --> 44:04.683
Even if you wish you weren't.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.229
But someone has to go out there
and bring back help.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.524
Are you sure about this?

44:13.692 --> 44:17.488
You have one flare left.
You'll know when to use it.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.948
That's how I'll find you.

44:21.825 --> 44:22.993
See you soon.

44:33.879 --> 44:36.340
If you die now, I'll be pissed.

44:43.138 --> 44:45.307
Will?
Will?

44:45.808 --> 44:46.850
Will!  Where are you?

44:48.936 --> 44:49.895
I'm here.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.231
-Hey.

44:52.564 --> 44:54.817
-I didn't run off.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.780
We were just exploring.

45:01.448 --> 45:05.744
Yeah, well...
that's enough exploring for today.

45:07.663 --> 45:08.705
Come on.

45:22.511 --> 45:26.098
Mom... Mom, Dad, Will, do you hear me?
Anybody? Over.

45:51.498 --> 45:52.666
Cool.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.555
Will, come here.
-We need to get cover. Come on!

46:06.638 --> 46:07.848
Quick! Quick! Come on!

46:13.562 --> 46:14.396
Come on.  Go. Go.

46:28.660 --> 46:29.495
Damn.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.007
<i>Mom</i>

46:42.090 --> 46:43.926
<i></i>

46:44.259 --> 46:45.511
<i>-Penny!</i>

46:45.594 --> 46:47.554
-I'm in the Chariot. Coming to get you.
<i></i>

46:47.638 --> 46:49.515
How did you--
<i>-We will discuss this</i>

46:49.598 --> 46:51.642
when you are also in the Chariot.

46:52.601 --> 46:55.437
<i>I can't track you because of the storm.</i>
<i>Where are you? </i>

46:55.521 --> 46:56.355
Uh...

46:56.438 --> 46:58.440
-We're... We're, uh...

47:01.860 --> 47:03.028
Look for the light.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.821
The light?

47:05.614 --> 47:08.367
Here. Put them on.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.256
I see it. I see it. I'm coming!

47:27.469 --> 47:29.346
Oh, that light.

47:31.098 --> 47:34.184
-Look.
-Go! Go, go, go! Go!

47:35.727 --> 47:36.728
Come on!

47:37.563 --> 47:38.522
Penny!

47:41.108 --> 47:42.526
Not the daughter you expected?

47:43.026 --> 47:44.736
-Please drive.
Move over.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.531
I don't think he'll fit.

47:49.241 --> 47:51.410
-Tell him to hold on tight.
-Hold on to the back!

47:55.747 --> 47:58.584
-Put your seat belts on.
-Let's go.

48:19.813 --> 48:22.441
Excellent. You finished the list.

48:33.327 --> 48:36.330
Listen, I should have, uh,
been more receptive to you.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.915
You have the experience,
the training, and I...

48:41.001 --> 48:42.252
I was wrong.

48:44.546 --> 48:46.048
I'm glad you were here today.

48:47.674 --> 48:49.051
What about tomorrow?

48:50.218 --> 48:51.970
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.808
So which one of you
do I need to listen to?

49:20.999 --> 49:23.460
Angela! That's our ride!

49:28.215 --> 49:31.802
It's the last flare we got.
Give it a peck for good luck.

49:38.183 --> 49:40.102
Dad. Dad, look.

49:40.727 --> 49:41.770
There's someone out there.

49:45.941 --> 49:46.858
We can make it.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.069
-Wha--
-Don't do the math.

49:56.493 --> 49:57.661
Just to be clear,

49:57.744 --> 50:01.164
we just got out of the storm
and now you wanna go back in?

50:07.879 --> 50:09.673
There, there. I see them right there.

50:14.469 --> 50:15.887
Come on!
Come on!

50:16.680 --> 50:18.390
-Come on!
-Come on!

50:20.892 --> 50:23.186
-Run! Get in!
-Hurry! Come on!

50:23.812 --> 50:25.564
-I've got the bag.
-Come on. Come on.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.441
-It's okay.

50:27.524 --> 50:28.942
Is there anyone else with you?

50:30.318 --> 50:31.194
No. It's just me.

50:36.658 --> 50:38.160
Go!

50:47.419 --> 50:48.628
<i>My necklace.</i>

50:58.680 --> 51:00.182
<i>You have one flare left.</i>

51:00.265 --> 51:03.143
<i>You'll know when to use it. See you soon.</i>

51:03.977 --> 51:05.562
Son of a bitch!

51:21.244 --> 51:22.204
Thank you.

51:22.287 --> 51:25.081
You're so brave. What's your name?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.292
I'm Penny. This is my brother, Will.

51:27.375 --> 51:29.127
-Hi.
Hi.

51:29.586 --> 51:31.129
I always wanted a brother.

51:40.430 --> 51:42.057
Come on. Come on. Come on.

51:50.982 --> 51:53.026
Come on. Come on.
-Oh, my God!

51:53.110 --> 51:54.569
-Come on, come on!
-Dad, come on!

52:01.827 --> 52:05.372
-Dad! Dad! Go!
-Come on!

52:46.997 --> 52:47.998
You did it.

52:49.374 --> 52:52.586
Yeah. This is really not my thing.

52:53.628 --> 52:56.548
You need to get back to being you,
so I can get back to being me.

52:56.631 --> 52:58.008
-Come here.

53:00.844 --> 53:01.845
-Here.
-Thank you.

53:01.928 --> 53:03.889
-You're welcome.
-Thank you so much.

53:04.764 --> 53:06.224
-I think so.

53:06.308 --> 53:07.142
Good.
