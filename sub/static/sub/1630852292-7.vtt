WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.237
* MTV. *

00:08.041 --> 00:09.710
Previously on The Challenge.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.445
We got the Three Kings
and the Queen, baby.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.781
- And the Queen, yep.
- This is the Kings' Palace,

00:13.881 --> 00:16.817
and we're going to preserve it
at all costs.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.986
My boy Nehemiah
and I are playing

00:19.086 --> 00:20.920
completely different games;
understanding that

00:21.021 --> 00:24.091
we're not on the same team
right now is too hard to ignore.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.626
Today's game is gonna be
played in pairs.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.829
So choose wisely,
because they are

00:28.928 --> 00:32.432
your one and only partner
for the rest of the season.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.835
(screaming)

00:35.735 --> 00:37.470
Jasmine and Tyler,
I'll be seeing

00:37.570 --> 00:38.939
both of you in the Arena.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.473
And our winners
of today's challenge,

00:40.573 --> 00:41.841
- Brad and Jodi.
- Yeah!

00:41.942 --> 00:44.777
- What's wrong?
- This rib is out.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.380
Take me to the hospital.

00:46.479 --> 00:49.283
Laterrian, I will be voting
for you and Kendal.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.286
- You and Kendal.
- Sorry, Laterrian.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.920
- Don't apologize.
- You and Kendal.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.856
Kendal is medically
unable to continue,

00:55.956 --> 00:57.890
so she is out
for the rest of the season.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.759
- (grunting)
- There you go!

00:59.859 --> 01:02.195
TJ: Unfortunately,
Tyler, this ends your time

01:02.295 --> 01:04.597
here on All Stars.
Congratulations, Laterrian.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.468
You and Jasmine are proud owners
of the life shield.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.337
BRAD: It's getting too close
to the end of the game,

01:09.436 --> 01:11.171
and the important thing
right now is not just

01:11.272 --> 01:12.906
keeping yourself safe
from elimination

01:13.006 --> 01:15.442
but keeping your alliance
safe from elimination.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.783
(music)

01:31.525 --> 01:33.527
* Uh-uh, save the Palace *

01:33.627 --> 01:36.530
* Save the Palace,
uh-uh-bluh *

01:36.629 --> 01:38.865
* Save the queen,
save the shield *

01:38.966 --> 01:40.867
* When enemies come,
we make them yield *

01:40.968 --> 01:42.569
- Whoo!
- * Lay them down! *

01:42.670 --> 01:44.771
* On the ground,
take over your city *

01:44.871 --> 01:47.508
* We own your town,
play no games *

01:47.608 --> 01:49.109
* You know the rules *

01:49.210 --> 01:51.212
* Tell them fools
to run the jewels... *

01:51.311 --> 01:53.281
TECK: The Kings' Palace is
still alive and well.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.914
Myself, Nehemiah, Laterrian,

01:55.015 --> 01:57.784
Melinda, some new members,
Jasmine and Ayanna.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.753
All we gotta do is
make it to the final,

01:59.853 --> 02:01.588
and hopefully one of the members
of the Kings' Palace

02:01.688 --> 02:03.590
will win the $500,000,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.225
and that's
our main goal.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.561
If they win, we all win.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.798
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

02:10.897 --> 02:12.532
Go, go!

02:12.633 --> 02:15.235
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

02:15.336 --> 02:16.937
Oh, oh, oh!

02:17.037 --> 02:19.272
LATERRIAN:
I feel mad confident.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.275
Each of us in our room has...

02:21.375 --> 02:23.411
faced elimination
and come back

02:23.510 --> 02:24.944
and come back
with a life shield.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.379
We just bossed up.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.747
Like, that's what we do.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.349
I will go in any lion's den

02:29.449 --> 02:30.751
with this group of men

02:30.850 --> 02:32.786
and this woman right here
next to me.

02:32.885 --> 02:35.956
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

02:36.055 --> 02:37.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:37.824 --> 02:40.828
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

02:40.927 --> 02:42.695
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:42.795 --> 02:45.365
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace... *

02:45.466 --> 02:47.000
- The way that we run?
- Mm-hmm?

02:47.099 --> 02:48.901
- Loyalty, we don't do...
- Absolutely.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.937
- ...that backstabbing shit.
- I just sat back.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.673
- I've been a part of nothing.
- MELINDA: Yeah.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.474
I just sat there.
I'm glad to be

02:54.574 --> 02:57.277
a part of something now,
it feels good, so...

02:57.377 --> 02:58.846
I got this, like,
and Laterrian,

02:58.945 --> 03:01.514
I'm so happy to have him
as a partner, so...

03:01.615 --> 03:03.050
All right, you wanna hear
some bullshit?

03:03.150 --> 03:05.151
"Yeah, I agree,
this is great, oh, my God,

03:05.252 --> 03:07.854
no one's worked with me, it's so
great to be a part of you."

03:07.955 --> 03:10.022
If Laterrian wants to believe

03:10.122 --> 03:13.026
the clownery and the foolery,
then let him.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.429
- You part of it now.
- Well, thank you.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.197
I'm glad to be
a part of the family.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.998
- It feels good.
- Yay!

03:19.098 --> 03:20.901
Melly Mel!

03:21.001 --> 03:23.403
JONNA: Before,
Jasmine was on our side,

03:23.503 --> 03:25.573
but now that she's paired
with Laterrian,

03:25.673 --> 03:27.174
I'm not really sure
where she stands.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.676
But I know that Jasmine still
won't vote for me,

03:29.776 --> 03:32.712
so, you know,
you guys may have lost Jasmine,

03:32.812 --> 03:34.715
but I haven't lost Jasmine.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.418
JANELLE:
There is definitely a line

03:37.518 --> 03:38.819
- been drawn.
- BRAD: A hundred percent.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.121
The Four Kings
plus Ayanna upstairs.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.156
We just gotta secure that W.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.026
JANELLE: I really need
Brad to understand

03:46.126 --> 03:47.561
what needs to be done.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.562
Nehemiah has put himself
in this position,

03:49.663 --> 03:51.230
and he's the one
that's gonna have to deal

03:51.331 --> 03:52.733
with the outcome of it.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.835
We are not a part
of the Four Kings alliance,

03:54.935 --> 03:57.069
and there's only so many
who we can choose from

03:57.170 --> 04:01.040
at this point. I think
that's a hard reality for Brad.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.844
We can't just assume
that Nehemiah and Melinda

04:04.944 --> 04:07.014
wouldn't throw votes our way.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.049
BRAD: I thought about that
tonight, and I realized

04:09.149 --> 04:11.084
that I'm gonna have to have
a conversation with Nee,

04:11.183 --> 04:13.020
- because--
- Don't have that conversation.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.055
- Do not, don't--
- Let me explain,
let me explain.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.689
This is the way
I wanted to word it.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.492
I'm gonna ask him,
like, it's clear

04:18.591 --> 04:20.293
what you guys have
going on in this room,

04:20.394 --> 04:21.894
and I just wanna know,

04:21.995 --> 04:25.031
if it comes down
to you and I personally,

04:25.132 --> 04:27.768
having to vote
for one or the other

04:27.867 --> 04:30.170
because the alliance wants
to go that route,

04:30.269 --> 04:31.838
which way would you go?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.874
- It's an "if
the alliance wants..."
- Let's not--

04:33.973 --> 04:36.009
Let's not ask
any open questions right now.

04:36.108 --> 04:38.144
BRAD: Nehemiah's
a close friend of mine

04:38.245 --> 04:39.779
inside and outside
of these games.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.749
I'm trying to do
anything I can

04:41.848 --> 04:43.384
not to have to say
my guy's name,

04:43.483 --> 04:45.018
but the truth is
Nehemiah and I had

04:45.117 --> 04:46.954
no conversation
about gameplay.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.922
So there is no agreement
to even violate.

04:49.021 --> 04:51.824
I'm doing everything
I can not to vote for him,

04:51.925 --> 04:53.726
but it's starting
to look awkward on my end

04:53.826 --> 04:55.262
to keep defending him.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.963
Brad, don't do it.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.401
(phone ringing)

05:00.500 --> 05:02.370
(phone continues ringing)

05:02.470 --> 05:04.672
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.139
- How're you doing?
- I did some things

05:07.240 --> 05:10.043
this week that I think
you'll be very proud of.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.178
I'm very proud of,
and I miss you.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.213
I'm excited to see it.
And I miss you too.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.449
CASEY: My fiancé and I
have been together

05:16.550 --> 05:18.218
for six years.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.687
And, if I wasn't here
on "The Challenge,"

05:20.788 --> 05:23.557
I would be at home,
doing the wedding planning.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.192
I'm really okay with taking
a break from it.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.795
And hopefully winning
a little extra cash

05:28.896 --> 05:30.497
to have that nice wedding

05:30.598 --> 05:32.699
and to set my fiancé and I up

05:32.800 --> 05:34.634
for an amazing future.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.302
Everyone's on edge
and just, like,

05:36.403 --> 05:37.904
hysterically crying
'cause they're talking

05:38.004 --> 05:39.939
to their family
and stuff, so, like,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.742
I'm, like, at a point where,
like, a leaf could fall wrong,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.245
and I'm just like,
"Oh, my fucking God!

05:45.345 --> 05:46.747
"I can't!

05:46.846 --> 05:50.350
Just fuckin'... leave!"

05:50.451 --> 05:52.620
- Calm down.
- I know...

05:53.721 --> 05:56.122
(laughing)

05:56.223 --> 05:58.358
- I love you
- Love you, too.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.160
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.932
(thumping music)

06:21.649 --> 06:24.016
- Look, it's a monster--
- A monster truck!

06:24.117 --> 06:26.586
- (laughing)
- What the hell?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.321
Wow.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.430
- (tires squealing)
- * They see me rollin' *

06:36.529 --> 06:38.331
* They're hatin' *

06:38.432 --> 06:41.201
* Patrolling and tryin'
to catch me ridin' dirty *

06:41.300 --> 06:43.136
* Tryin' to catch me
ridin' dirty *

06:43.235 --> 06:44.971
* Tryin'
to catch me ridin' dirty *

06:45.072 --> 06:46.939
* Tryin' to catch me
ridin' dirty *

06:47.040 --> 06:51.110
(cheering and applause)

06:51.211 --> 06:52.846
* They can see me gleam
and my shine *

06:52.946 --> 06:54.581
* On the deck
and the TV screen *

06:54.682 --> 06:56.316
* Ridin' with a new chick,
she like "Hold up" *

06:56.415 --> 06:58.050
* Next to
the PlayStation controller *

06:58.151 --> 07:00.052
* If a fool trip,
then I'm gonna show ya *

07:00.153 --> 07:01.689
* Trying to catch me
ridin' dirty **

07:01.788 --> 07:02.956
What's up, everyone?

07:03.055 --> 07:04.591
- Hey!
- What's up, T?!

07:04.692 --> 07:07.026
(cheering)

07:07.127 --> 07:09.062
This challenge is
gonna be big.

07:09.161 --> 07:11.197
Not just because
I have that giant

07:11.298 --> 07:13.733
monster truck behind me,
but also because we have

07:13.834 --> 07:15.903
some badass cars,
some motorcycles,

07:16.002 --> 07:17.403
it's just gonna be awesome.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.372
Today's challenge is
called Steer Clear.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.175
(heavy rock and roll)

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
To begin,
you and your partner

07:25.377 --> 07:28.014
are gonna be on the back
of that monster truck.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.018
One of you is gonna be
hanging from that 20-foot boom

07:31.117 --> 07:32.985
off the back of that truck.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.588
The other partner is
gonna be steering the boom

07:35.689 --> 07:38.225
back and forth,
because when I say "go,"

07:38.324 --> 07:41.762
all those cars are
gonna race past you.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.965
Your goal is to gather
as many flags as you can

07:45.064 --> 07:46.966
one at a time.
Stuff 'em in that bag

07:47.067 --> 07:48.802
before the finish line.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.303
Now, the team to get
the most flags will win

07:51.403 --> 07:53.540
today's challenge
and be safe from elimination

07:53.641 --> 07:57.043
and also be putting two teams
on that nominated list.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.446
The team to collect
the least amount of flags

07:59.547 --> 08:02.314
will lose, and I'll see them
in the Arena.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.916
Good luck, everyone,
let's do it.

08:04.016 --> 08:07.920
(cheering and applause)

08:14.627 --> 08:17.096
(music)

08:20.199 --> 08:23.435
Does it get any fucking better
than this right now?

08:23.536 --> 08:25.872
I mean, how badass do I look?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.574
I have the best
possible teammate.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.177
If we don't win today,
there's a good possibility

08:30.276 --> 08:31.845
our heads are gonna be
on the chopping block.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.880
I just gotta say,
* Save the Palace *

08:33.980 --> 08:36.984
* Save the Palace,
bluh bluh bluh-bluh. *

08:37.084 --> 08:39.286
- You ready? Go!
- (blowing airhorn)

08:39.385 --> 08:41.989
Come on! Car!

08:50.163 --> 08:51.965
This is what The Challenge
is all about.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.335
Big rigs, fast cars,
monster trucks.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.803
This is a whole scale up.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.838
The kid in me is just
going crazy.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.673
Doing awesome, Nehemiah!

09:00.774 --> 09:04.076
Come on! Over! Over!

09:04.177 --> 09:07.313
Melinda and Nehemiah are
really proving themselves

09:07.413 --> 09:10.017
as a tough team; this is
not good for our alliance.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.485
The last thing we need
to have happen is

09:12.586 --> 09:13.886
Nehemiah and Melinda win.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.155
MELINDA:
You're doing awesome, Nehemiah!

09:16.255 --> 09:17.825
Over! Over!

09:17.924 --> 09:20.059
All the way right!

09:22.095 --> 09:24.831
- (blowing airhorn)
- And the plot thickens.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.066
They did awesome, though.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.533
- Yeah, they did.
- They crushed it.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.769
Everybody who's not
in the Kings' Palace is

09:29.870 --> 09:31.571
going in if we won today.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.706
But if we didn't win,
they're all my friends,

09:33.807 --> 09:36.143
and I love them all, and I hope
they don't throw us in.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.378
(laughing)

09:39.511 --> 09:41.114
TECK:
I'm gonna take this 155

09:41.213 --> 09:43.015
and swing this pole
the best I can.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.619
Well, that's what I normally do,
but it's a different pole.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.687
I gotta get all the flags.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.756
Because Teck told me
to get the flags,

09:49.856 --> 09:52.091
and I gotta get 'em,
and that's it.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.894
Let's go, Ayanna,
let's do this.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.495
(screaming)

09:56.596 --> 09:58.264
Teck, Ayanna, you ready?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.399
- Let's go!
- (blowing airhorn)

10:00.500 --> 10:02.534
Whoo!

10:02.635 --> 10:05.004
Fuck this-- oh!

10:05.105 --> 10:08.942
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:09.042 --> 10:11.678
(screaming)

10:11.778 --> 10:13.980
All I can see is
the moving ground...

10:14.081 --> 10:16.984
and these big,
huge monster truck wheels.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.452
(screaming)

10:20.552 --> 10:22.221
Ahh, shit, motherfucker!

10:27.226 --> 10:29.663
- (horn blaring)
- (screaming)

10:29.763 --> 10:31.798
Ahh, shit, motherfucker!

10:31.899 --> 10:33.466
Oh, I don't like this shit!

10:33.566 --> 10:35.201
- (screaming)
- Let's go!

10:35.302 --> 10:37.004
Ayanna, you know what?
If you stop screaming,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.005
maybe you can hear me
and we can work together,

10:39.105 --> 10:41.341
and we can get some more flags
instead of you just going

10:41.441 --> 10:43.009
- back and forth...
- (screaming)

10:43.110 --> 10:44.912
You know what?
Just fuck it, don't even--

10:45.011 --> 10:46.479
just don't
even worry about it.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.148
Don't even worry about it.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.283
* I'm like a bird,
I wanna fly away *

10:51.384 --> 10:53.986
(screaming)

10:54.086 --> 10:55.288
(laughing)

10:55.388 --> 10:58.125
(screaming)

10:58.892 --> 11:01.260
* I'm like a bird,
I wanna fly away *

11:01.360 --> 11:02.528
Oh...

11:02.629 --> 11:05.065
oh, come on, baby,
come on, baby.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.000
* I don't know
where my home is *

11:07.100 --> 11:08.500
Please don't hit me.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.203
(screaming)

11:11.303 --> 11:13.340
(blowing airhorn)

11:13.440 --> 11:14.407
(cheering and applause)

11:14.506 --> 11:18.044
Oh, fuck this shit right here.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.713
DARRELL:
This is pretty insane.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.049
The experiences
I'm having are unmatched,

11:23.149 --> 11:25.184
and that's not hyperbole,
that's just fuckin' facts.

11:25.284 --> 11:28.520
I am so excited to have
Laterrian as a partner.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.123
I couldn't've asked
for a better partner.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.192
He is patient, he's strong,

11:32.292 --> 11:34.126
I have heart,
I'll never quit.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.864
We're the perfect combo,
so I'm so excited for this.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.731
Laterrian, Jasmine,
you ready?

11:38.831 --> 11:40.700
- Go!
- (blowing airhorn)

11:40.801 --> 11:42.469
All right, let's do it!

11:42.568 --> 11:46.038
Left! Left! Aah!
Right! Right!

11:46.139 --> 11:48.540
Right! Right!

11:50.376 --> 11:52.946
Left! Left! Left! Left!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.014
Left! Left! Left!

11:55.115 --> 11:58.085
Right! Right!
Right! Right!

11:58.184 --> 11:59.186
Don't move!

11:59.286 --> 12:00.854
(grunts) Left!

12:00.953 --> 12:03.190
I have this life shield,
and I know I'm safe,

12:03.289 --> 12:05.057
but my roommates,
the Three Kings and the Queen,

12:05.158 --> 12:08.461
are not, so I wanna win
to protect my room.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.029
But right now
we are struggling.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.599
- (horn blowing)
- (Laterrian panting)

12:12.698 --> 12:13.866
What's going on?

12:13.966 --> 12:15.634
I don't-- I think
he's having trouble.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.004
It looks like Laterrian's
kind of having a hard time

12:18.105 --> 12:19.538
operating this arm.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.808
Right! Right!
(groaning)

12:21.908 --> 12:23.976
And poor Jasmine is
just so short

12:24.076 --> 12:26.678
that she's having a hard time
going out to snag

12:26.779 --> 12:29.749
any of these flags;
they barely have any flags,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.283
so that's good
for our alliance.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.153
(straining)

12:34.321 --> 12:35.822
Fuck!

12:37.024 --> 12:40.059
- (blowing airhorn)
- (screaming)

12:40.159 --> 12:42.261
- TJ: All right, next up,
let's go!
- Let's go!

12:42.361 --> 12:44.197
- All right, you ready? Go!
- (blowing airhorn)

12:44.297 --> 12:46.698
(motors revving)

12:47.934 --> 12:49.269
We're not close enough!

12:49.369 --> 12:51.671
Closer!
Closer! Closer!

12:51.770 --> 12:53.706
We've gotta go
closer, Darrell!

12:53.807 --> 12:55.607
I done bring Janelle
all the way over,

12:55.707 --> 12:56.976
now she can't reach
the damn flag!

12:57.076 --> 12:59.312
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

12:59.412 --> 13:01.849
Do it over here?
Same thing, I'm missing flags.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.515
I'm not getting close!

13:03.615 --> 13:04.650
DARRELL:
When you do these challenges,

13:04.750 --> 13:05.952
you gotta be aggressive.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.354
One flag could determine
if you're going

13:07.453 --> 13:09.255
into elimination today.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.624
I'm not getting close enough!

13:12.658 --> 13:15.261
Far to the left!
Left! Left!

13:16.830 --> 13:18.197
We really need
this win today

13:18.298 --> 13:20.133
because of
the alliance situation.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.802
If one of the four teams
takes the win,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.703
it could potentially mean
that me and Darrell

13:24.803 --> 13:26.538
are going
into elimination.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.842
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

13:29.942 --> 13:33.846
- (blowing airhorn)
- (cheering)

13:33.947 --> 13:35.915
TJ: All right, next up,
Casey, Cohutta.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.884
- You ready? Go!
- (blowing airhorn)

13:37.985 --> 13:39.919
(music)

13:41.187 --> 13:43.090
Fuck!

13:43.190 --> 13:44.756
All right, motherfucker!

13:44.857 --> 13:46.558
CASEY: Cohutta is
somebody who...

13:46.658 --> 13:48.695
I don't ever
want to let down.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.496
I think he's
so supportive of me.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.599
He wanted to be my partner.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.701
I just wanna make him proud

13:54.801 --> 13:58.238
and not put us in jeopardy
of going home tonight.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.273
(music)

14:00.373 --> 14:02.674
* Mm, I'm going down,
down, baby *

14:02.774 --> 14:03.910
* Your street in a Range Rover *

14:04.010 --> 14:05.412
* Boom, boom, baby *

14:05.511 --> 14:06.980
* Ready to let it go *

14:07.080 --> 14:09.615
This season is
very important for me

14:09.716 --> 14:11.150
to come home with a win,

14:11.250 --> 14:13.586
and Casey seemed to have
turned over a new leaf

14:13.686 --> 14:16.288
with this challenge.
She really came to play.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.856
And she's brave,

14:17.957 --> 14:20.226
and she's willing
to conquer these fears.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.661
Come here, motherfucker!

14:21.760 --> 14:23.495
(yelps)

14:23.596 --> 14:26.066
(cheering)

14:26.166 --> 14:27.567
Pull up!

14:27.667 --> 14:29.036
* Boom, boom, baby *

14:29.135 --> 14:30.537
* Ready to let it go *

14:30.636 --> 14:31.904
* Shimmy shimmy cocoa what *

14:32.004 --> 14:33.740
* Listen to it pound *

14:33.840 --> 14:35.107
* Light it up
and take a ... *

14:35.207 --> 14:36.676
* Pass it to me now *

14:36.775 --> 14:38.544
- (blowing airhorn)
- (screaming)

14:38.644 --> 14:40.312
(TJ laughing)

14:42.282 --> 14:44.350
We're targeting
Nehemiah because...

14:44.451 --> 14:46.686
he's the leader
of the Kings' Palace,

14:46.786 --> 14:48.721
so we gotta take down
their leader.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.389
MJ: We're definitely
going for the W,

14:50.490 --> 14:53.293
and Nehemiah, you'd better
fuckin' watch out, bro.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.195
MJ, Jonna, let's go!

14:55.294 --> 14:58.798
- Ready? Go!
- (blowing airhorn)

14:59.698 --> 15:00.700
Oh, fuck.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.369
JONNA:
Further out.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.037
Go.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.940
MELINDA: There is
a clear line drawn in the sand,

15:07.039 --> 15:08.674
so we really can't have

15:08.774 --> 15:10.143
MJ, Jonna,

15:10.243 --> 15:11.844
any of that side
of the house, winning.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.245
Got it! Next!

15:13.346 --> 15:15.948
MELINDA: Because,
if any one of them win,

15:16.048 --> 15:19.485
we know for sure we will be
going into elimination.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.821
That way, come on.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.889
- Go!
- You're doing great, baby!

15:23.990 --> 15:27.659
MJ's pretty strong,
and I know I'm pretty fearless.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.129
He's putting me
in a great position

15:29.229 --> 15:31.030
to grab these flags.
I am pretty much

15:31.130 --> 15:33.600
getting every single flag,
as many as I can.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.668
So I think we got this
in the bag today.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.238
Literally,
flags in the bag.

15:38.337 --> 15:39.371
(chuckling)

15:39.471 --> 15:41.807
Back. This way.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.452
- (blowing airhorn)
- MJ: Good job, baby!

15:54.921 --> 15:56.489
BRAD: We're both
very physically capable.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.490
I think that I'm gonna
put her right on the flags.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.159
I know she's gonna grab 'em
and get 'em in the bag.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.927
The lines have been
drawn in the sand

16:02.028 --> 16:03.929
as far as alliances in the house
for the most part.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.999
And it's-- it's a good place
to be if you're winning.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.700
And, uh, if you do win,
you'd better

16:07.799 --> 16:09.668
keep winning, though, 'cause
people are getting pissed.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.471
(music)

16:11.571 --> 16:15.442
- Brad and Jodi, you ready?
- (blowing airhorn)

16:19.745 --> 16:21.447
Nice going!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.654
Brad, get me over!

16:28.754 --> 16:30.356
Everybody wants
that big money.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.192
It's a half a million dollars.
Let's get serious.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.726
I have two sons.
Brady and Chase.

16:34.826 --> 16:37.163
They're six and nine,
and I will say,

16:37.264 --> 16:39.331
they are my heart,
I truly live for them,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.268
and I need to stay
focused in this game

16:41.368 --> 16:43.503
because we could do a lot
of good things with this money.

16:43.602 --> 16:46.273
Damn it...
(grunting)

16:47.539 --> 16:49.375
More, more!

16:50.543 --> 16:51.943
Go over this way!

16:54.514 --> 16:57.750
More! More!

16:59.152 --> 17:01.388
- Give me more! More!
- Okay, good.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.855
Got it!

17:04.891 --> 17:06.259
Go over this way!

17:06.358 --> 17:07.960
I started getting
a little bit bossy,

17:08.060 --> 17:09.596
but it's more just
my adrenaline's going,

17:09.695 --> 17:10.997
and I'm really excited.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.531
Over further--
further, Brad!

17:12.632 --> 17:15.867
Over more! Over more!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.440
(blowing airhorn)

17:20.539 --> 17:22.509
Whoo! Good job, girl.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.411
I missed two, Brad!

17:24.510 --> 17:26.278
Trust me, you did good.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.115
MJ: I can tell that
it's a very close race between

17:28.214 --> 17:30.950
Nehemiah and Melinda
and Jodi and Brad,

17:31.049 --> 17:33.185
but it's literally
gonna come down to,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.822
I believe, one or two flags,
on who the winner is.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.325
(soft chatter)

17:38.424 --> 17:40.126
(music)

17:40.227 --> 17:42.095
All right, everyone,
great challenge today.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.997
(cheering and applause)

17:45.097 --> 17:47.967
Our winners for today's
challenge...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.537
the one team to get
the most flags recovered

17:50.636 --> 17:53.173
was...

17:54.707 --> 17:56.808
- Brad and Jodi.
- (applause)

17:56.909 --> 17:58.211
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations,

17:58.310 --> 17:59.846
you are safe from elimination.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.314
I am just feeling, like,

18:01.413 --> 18:03.583
really full of life
and happiness right now.

18:03.682 --> 18:07.153
To win three in a row has
just been amazing.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.788
Just a boost
of self-confidence for me.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.123
In some ways,
I feel stronger

18:10.222 --> 18:11.824
than I did 15 years ago.

18:11.923 --> 18:13.660
- Wow.
- (applause dies out)

18:13.759 --> 18:15.961
Brad and Jodi winning is...

18:16.061 --> 18:17.930
not a good thing
for the Kings' Palace.

18:18.029 --> 18:20.567
I feel like even though
Brad and Nehemiah

18:20.666 --> 18:23.536
have some sort of kinship,
I-- I don't think that

18:23.635 --> 18:26.439
they're gonna do anything
to try to protect us whatsoever.

18:26.538 --> 18:31.510
Now, the two worst teams were
separated by one flag.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.448
And those teams were

18:35.548 --> 18:37.517
Laterrian and Jasmine...

18:39.318 --> 18:42.221
...and Teck and Ayanna.

18:44.391 --> 18:48.260
But the worst team of the day...

18:48.361 --> 18:51.730
was Laterrian and Jasmine.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.400
However, they hold
the life shield,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.902
so they're safe
from elimination,

18:56.001 --> 18:58.238
which means,
Teck and Ayanna,

18:58.337 --> 19:00.339
I'll be seeing you in the Arena.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.976
Even though we had
so much fun doing this,

19:04.076 --> 19:05.744
we got last.
It happens.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.248
Has to suck
for Ayanna and Teck.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.217
Have fun.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.785
TJ: Now, Brad and Jodi,
as the winners,

19:12.884 --> 19:14.320
I need you to go
back to the villa,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.222
deliberate,
and nominate two teams

19:16.323 --> 19:20.026
for possible selection
to go against our losers.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.728
As much as I'm enjoying
this winning streak

19:21.827 --> 19:23.895
that Jodi and I are on,
things are still difficult

19:23.996 --> 19:26.333
because Laterrian
and Jasmine are safe,

19:26.432 --> 19:29.201
and Teck and Ayanna are
definitely going to elimination.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.304
That only gives me
one other option

19:31.403 --> 19:34.006
from their alliance
to put up against them.

19:34.105 --> 19:37.443
I'm gonna have to nominate
my guy Nehemiah.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.912
And I will see you all
at the Arena.

19:40.011 --> 19:42.949
- Take care.
- (applause)

19:44.351 --> 19:46.919
(music)

19:56.328 --> 19:58.365
NEHEMIAH: It is what it is.
It's already settled.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.132
They're gonna put
us versus you.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.167
So, in these situations,

20:02.269 --> 20:04.069
you kind of get
to test friendships.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.405
What happens
when there's money on the line?

20:06.506 --> 20:09.541
A couple of people warned me,
like, yo, don't trust Brad,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.544
but I was like,

20:11.644 --> 20:13.913
no, Brad is cool, Brad is ish,
you know what I'm saying?

20:14.012 --> 20:15.414
Like, that's my boy.
Like, to me,

20:15.515 --> 20:18.017
you can't put
a price on friendship.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.287
I might be able
to avoid this elimination

20:20.386 --> 20:22.489
because Brad won,
but when it comes to this game,

20:22.588 --> 20:25.156
nothing is really guaranteed,
so I'm just hoping

20:25.258 --> 20:28.595
that we are not the ones
to go in this time.

20:28.694 --> 20:32.398
(music)

20:42.208 --> 20:45.211
Okay... so my thought.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.179
Laterrian and Jasmine
already saved themselves.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.316
- Yes.
- Yeah, so we can't
put them in.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.116
- They're already... safe.
- Correct, yeah.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.319
So my thought is
Nehemiah, Melinda.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.521
And then,
as a total smokescreen,

20:55.622 --> 20:56.989
put Darrell
and Janelle up there,

20:57.088 --> 20:59.191
and they're not gonna go in.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.961
I don't have an option
for Nee and Mel,

21:02.060 --> 21:04.195
because they're the only people

21:04.297 --> 21:06.198
not working with us.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.401
- Yeah.
- And they-- you know,

21:08.500 --> 21:10.537
announcing their alliance
on a regular basis.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.204
I don't even-- I don't have
any hard feelings about that,

21:13.306 --> 21:14.973
but for the game moves
themselves,

21:15.074 --> 21:17.108
- the lines have been drawn
clear as day.
- Yeah.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.311
Do you think
Darrell and Janelle

21:19.412 --> 21:21.548
over Casey and Cohutta?

21:21.647 --> 21:23.950
Cohutta has already been
in elimination.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.684
- Okay.
- And come back and won.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.753
Casey's been up there
multiple times.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.356
I almost would rather show
loyalty to the people

21:30.457 --> 21:32.157
that are most likely
gonna show loyalty back,

21:32.258 --> 21:34.394
- statistically speaking.
- And he did better...

21:34.493 --> 21:36.496
- Agreed.
- ...in the challenge
than Cohutta did.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.096
- I see where
you're coming from.
- Consistently.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.665
Consistently.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.368
I would rather put
Casey and Cohutta up.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.471
I'm suggesting that
we put up Cohutta and Casey

21:45.572 --> 21:48.674
just as a decoy vote because,
performance-wise,

21:48.775 --> 21:51.344
it kind of sits proper
with our alliance,

21:51.443 --> 21:53.945
and I know that
we've got the vote controlled,

21:54.046 --> 21:55.682
so they should be safe there.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.785
Okay, so Casey, Cohutta;
Nehemiah, Melinda.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.420
- Yes? All right.
- Yeah.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.288
(music)

22:11.864 --> 22:14.967
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean,
half a million dollar apologies

22:15.067 --> 22:16.368
really aren't worth that much.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.970
- Exactly.
- All right, let's do it.

22:18.069 --> 22:19.538
Let's go.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.608
(music)

22:33.552 --> 22:36.355
I got my boy,
who's in a position of power,

22:36.455 --> 22:38.724
and now my name's
on the board.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.394
It's a tough situation
to be in right now.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.065
Hey, listen, here's the part

22:46.164 --> 22:47.567
I'm hoping
you'll hear me out on, okay?

22:47.666 --> 22:49.402
I tried pushing
a different play.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.771
I tried.
I want you to know that.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.707
That's the game, man.
It is what it is.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.108
No, but, Nee, listen.
I tried the best I could.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.845
I hope you understand that.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.647
If I wasn't supposed to do this,
what else could I have done?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.615
There was nobody else
that I could've put up.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.451
I am disappointed
that there's not even

23:05.551 --> 23:07.086
a little bit
of understanding.

23:07.185 --> 23:08.688
- We all gotta play
our game, too.
- No, it's...

23:08.788 --> 23:10.288
It's a half-million dollar
game, you know?

23:10.388 --> 23:12.157
I totally get it.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.933
(music)

23:24.403 --> 23:26.172
BRAD: You got
put up there with Casey,

23:26.271 --> 23:28.207
but Nee and Mel are up there,
there's clear lines

23:28.307 --> 23:30.142
drawn in the sand,
so, like, you know

23:30.241 --> 23:32.578
- how that's gonna shake down.
- It's just gonna be like

23:32.679 --> 23:35.047
what happened
to Jonna and I last time.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.984
- Yeah.
- And Darrell.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.787
- Darrell and Janelle.
- And Janelle.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.454
- Yeah.
- Right.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.958
I'm aware that our alliance had
to make some moves,

23:46.057 --> 23:48.627
and somebody's
gotta be up there

23:48.728 --> 23:51.363
pitted against
Nehemiah and Melinda.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.098
I trust Brad.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.300
That might bite me
in the ass, but I do.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.269
I'm fine with it
as long as everybody

23:57.368 --> 24:00.306
keeps their word and is worth--
their word's worth a shit.

24:00.405 --> 24:03.675
- Well, we'll see.
- You got mine, bud.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.244
(music)

24:10.883 --> 24:12.183
Hey, there, cutie.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.885
- Hey, there.
- So I got in the shower

24:13.986 --> 24:16.122
and got out,
and then got spoken to.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.892
I'm-a let you two have a convo.

24:19.991 --> 24:23.730
I'm not worried that
we're gonna get voted in at all.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.499
I was more worried
about you being worried.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.366
Oh, I'm fuckin' pissed.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.737
(music)

24:30.836 --> 24:32.739
CASEY: I don't wanna go
into nominations

24:32.838 --> 24:35.307
for a third time.
I'm getting a little sick of it.

24:35.406 --> 24:37.343
Somebody had to be
a scapegoat.

24:37.442 --> 24:40.378
Last week, MJ and Jonna
were the scapegoat.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.980
We were next in line.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.682
For no apparent reason,

24:43.782 --> 24:47.452
Darrell and Janelle are
completely immune to going in.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.188
I think I've earned my place,

24:49.288 --> 24:52.391
and I don't need to continue
to be a pawn in this game.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.527
As long as everybody is
worth their word,

24:54.626 --> 24:55.927
like, I'm not upset about it.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.697
As long as I can trust
those handshakes.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.798
I'm glad that
you have handshakes,

24:59.898 --> 25:02.433
'cause fuckin'
I certainly don't.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.003
Don't be mad-- yet.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.373
We don't have a reason
to be mad yet.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.815
I really haven't talked to you
a lot about gameplay

25:15.914 --> 25:18.049
up until this point,
but I will say this,

25:18.150 --> 25:19.919
like, it's likely gonna be

25:20.019 --> 25:22.555
that I end up voting
for you and Nehemiah

25:22.654 --> 25:25.657
based off of what I've seen.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.926
All I've seen is partying,

25:28.027 --> 25:30.162
after celebrations.

25:30.261 --> 25:32.463
- Okay, so celebrating...
- No, I'm...

25:32.565 --> 25:34.800
- ...is the problem.
- No, I-- it's not even that.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.869
It's just that
that was, like, a huge line

25:37.970 --> 25:41.007
- drawn in the sand, and...
- I think that's

25:41.106 --> 25:42.407
a bullshit line
that we're hearing.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.044
Anybody who goes
into an elimination

25:45.144 --> 25:47.078
and comes back,
and your friends aren't

25:47.179 --> 25:49.115
gonna celebrate with you?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.782
- Like, that--
- Yeah,

25:50.883 --> 25:52.652
but it's over-the-top,
Melinda.

25:52.751 --> 25:55.887
JANELLE:
I can't protect individuals

25:55.988 --> 25:58.324
who I have not
aligned myself with

25:58.423 --> 26:01.192
over individuals
who I have aligned myself with.

26:01.292 --> 26:03.730
If she was in my shoes,
she would probably

26:03.829 --> 26:05.196
be making the exact same moves.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.932
Hard decisions have
to be made.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.000
And I think everybody
needs a reminder of that.

26:09.101 --> 26:12.038
It doesn't make me
feel comfortable

26:12.137 --> 26:15.173
when I feel like
I'm on the outs of an alliance.

26:15.273 --> 26:18.711
Okay, I would never have
said your name, ever,

26:18.810 --> 26:21.480
and we'll leave it at that.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.554
Well, she kept saying
the Four Kings' alliance

26:28.654 --> 26:30.757
has been made very apparent,

26:30.856 --> 26:32.625
and it makes her
uncomfortable.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.526
- Janelle.
- Man, fuck that.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.828
Also, that they could
hear us celebrating

26:36.929 --> 26:39.865
- in the room downstairs.
- BOTH: So?

26:39.965 --> 26:41.366
- I'm just telling you.
- We've had...

26:41.467 --> 26:42.934
- We've had...
- No, I know what you're saying.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.971
...we've had four of us go
into elimination.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.606
- That's what I said.
- I wore a beard.

26:48.708 --> 26:52.979
- For Brad.
- I glued a beard to my face.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.380
It's everything, I love it.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.115
(laughing)

26:56.214 --> 26:59.050
Love you, family.
That's a good look.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.319
It's really hard
to know how to feel

27:01.420 --> 27:04.824
about Brad right now because,
if the tables were turned,

27:04.923 --> 27:07.026
I never would've
said his name.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.662
This is a blow,
and it, uh, it hurts.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.063
It hurts a lot.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.832
It's just a copout.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.366
They only utilize
those excuses

27:15.467 --> 27:17.135
when it works
to their benefit

27:17.236 --> 27:19.806
to justify an action
that they know is wrong.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.440
That's all it is.

27:21.539 --> 27:24.242
* I want to know,
my lovely *

27:26.278 --> 27:28.247
* I wanna know *

27:28.346 --> 27:30.215
* Where do you go? *

27:30.316 --> 27:32.018
* Oh-oh-oh-oh *

27:32.117 --> 27:33.853
* I want to know *

27:33.952 --> 27:35.788
* Oh-oh-oh-oh *

27:35.887 --> 27:38.089
(laughing)

27:39.925 --> 27:41.259
Oh, yeah, sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.494
- Oh, no.
- We can't have too much fun.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.297
Let's celebrate the W

27:45.396 --> 27:48.233
and just realize
that the game got tough.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.001
We wanted one of us to win.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.804
We wanted one of them to lose.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.538
We're right
where we wanted to be.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.441
* Where do you--
Where do you go? *

27:55.540 --> 27:57.509
Without y'all, we would not
be doing this right now.

27:57.608 --> 28:00.779
Well, bro, everybody plays
this game differently.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.048
But for me to blow
my entire game

28:03.148 --> 28:05.284
to try to keep one person
I'm not aligned with

28:05.384 --> 28:07.153
that I really have
a lot of love and respect for

28:07.252 --> 28:09.121
outside of this game,
that doesn't really

28:09.221 --> 28:11.356
mesh well with what I need
to do with this money,

28:11.457 --> 28:13.192
and what I'd like
to do with it.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.993
There's really
no other options for me to do

28:15.094 --> 28:16.996
other than prioritize
that half million dollars

28:17.096 --> 28:18.529
like everybody else would.
I know I made

28:18.630 --> 28:20.365
the right decision
for the game itself.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.667
LATERRIAN:
And this is why I say

28:22.769 --> 28:24.603
that Brad ain't shit.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.105
I'm over here, making plans

28:27.205 --> 28:29.008
to go see Brad at his house,

28:29.107 --> 28:30.942
and I'm still getting
thrown in by him.

28:31.042 --> 28:35.114
It bugs me
to see people go in twice,

28:35.213 --> 28:37.282
in the same season,
and motherfuckers who've

28:37.383 --> 28:40.586
done two seasons are
going in once.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.189
- It bugs me.
- We didn't choose

28:43.288 --> 28:45.723
this situation;
certain people felt

28:45.825 --> 28:48.160
intimidated by us
just from having camaraderie.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.429
How about this?
If you wanna get rid of me,

28:50.528 --> 28:52.397
- you come get rid of me.
- NEHEMIAH: You come get it.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.365
You bigger than half of us.
Your other man is bigger

28:54.465 --> 28:56.201
than half of us,
you come get that.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.304
You don't like that shit,
come get it, we right here.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.207
Nehemiah is starting to chirp.
He's doing what he does

29:01.307 --> 29:02.775
whenever he gets
backed in a corner.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.210
You're going in, bro.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.577
You're going in.
Deal with it.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.747
You got all these
store-bought muscles.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.183
- Come man up.
- Kings last, motherfucker.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.621
Kings last!
Rider! Rider!

29:15.721 --> 29:17.288
(overlapping shouts)

29:17.388 --> 29:20.659
Hey, fuck that.
Hey, hey, we fucking Kings.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.128
I'll say that shit loud--
we're fucking Kings, bro.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.297
I don't give a fuck
about them.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.232
You think I'm scared?

29:27.333 --> 29:29.701
Honestly, I'm feeling
really torn up.

29:29.801 --> 29:32.003
I did everything I could.
I could've only thrown

29:32.104 --> 29:34.306
my own game
under the bus to save him.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.075
There's a half a million
dollars on the line.

29:36.174 --> 29:38.410
Now he's yelling
negative things about me.

29:38.509 --> 29:40.679
across a restaurant.
I'm having a difficult night.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.048
I'm ready for the check.

29:42.147 --> 29:45.317
(music)

29:56.228 --> 29:58.964
- What's up, Nee?
- What up?

29:59.065 --> 30:00.665
How you feeling?

30:01.767 --> 30:04.269
Another day in paradise.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.672
- I wish I felt the same.
- How do you feel?

30:06.771 --> 30:08.339
Barely slept last night.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.910
I had some messed-up dreams
and woke up, and, like,

30:11.009 --> 30:12.611
none of this was sitting right,

30:12.711 --> 30:15.446
and I just want you
to know, like...

30:15.547 --> 30:18.683
this is a lot more important
than the rest of it.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.586
I know I'm at a good spot
in this game,

30:20.685 --> 30:23.288
and I wish that
our games worked out

30:23.388 --> 30:24.990
differently at this point.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.393
I didn't know where we stood
still with our friendship,

30:27.492 --> 30:29.161
you know,
after all of that went down,

30:29.260 --> 30:31.063
and it was like, oh, damn.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.799
One of the biggest things for us
to always be able to remember

30:34.901 --> 30:36.535
is that,
if there's anything

30:36.634 --> 30:38.304
that we're feeling
uncomfortable about,

30:38.403 --> 30:41.173
or don't understand,
it's like...

30:41.272 --> 30:44.476
those lines of communication
are always open.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.577
To me...

30:46.677 --> 30:50.182
that's what,
like, my friendships are.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.884
It's like being able
to have those

30:51.983 --> 30:55.320
uncomfortable conversations
and being able to...

30:55.421 --> 30:57.522
- You know what I mean?
- Trust me when I tell you,

30:57.623 --> 30:59.892
I'm sorry
for the miscommunication.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.461
The fact that Brad's
apologizing to me right now,

31:02.560 --> 31:04.529
it means a lot to me,
and I'm hoping that

31:04.630 --> 31:06.231
this apology is deeper
than this game,

31:06.332 --> 31:08.733
which is what I'm feeling
from him right now.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.137
So, I think that
this is a very, very good start

31:12.238 --> 31:14.306
on where we need
to go to kind of

31:14.405 --> 31:16.275
smooth this situation over.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.676
And I don't hold grudges.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.511
Do you know what I mean?
So I accept it,

31:20.612 --> 31:23.015
and I'll come back--
I'll come back into the house,

31:23.115 --> 31:25.917
and I'll still have love
for all of those

31:26.018 --> 31:27.353
who have love for me

31:27.452 --> 31:29.820
and even the ones
who don't, you know?

31:29.922 --> 31:32.458
(music)

31:47.073 --> 31:48.673
I overthink things a lot.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.076
And this could all be
related to stress

31:51.176 --> 31:52.911
and just being
in this environment,

31:53.011 --> 31:55.346
but I'm an accountant,

31:55.447 --> 31:57.983
so I've done the math,
and, at this point,

31:58.084 --> 32:02.121
I'm fairly certain that
there's a very solid chance

32:02.221 --> 32:03.922
that I could be pregnant.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.836
(music)

32:17.935 --> 32:19.938
(birds tweeting)

32:22.607 --> 32:24.175
(phone ringing)

32:24.276 --> 32:27.980
Hey, baby.
How're you doing?

32:28.079 --> 32:30.548
(sighing)

32:30.648 --> 32:32.250
I miss you.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.652
I miss you more.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.320
I can't wait to see you!

32:35.421 --> 32:38.757
I know, I'm so excited!
How're you doing?

32:40.791 --> 32:43.295
I'm good-- like,
I've been sleeping a lot,

32:43.394 --> 32:45.730
and I thought it was exhaustion,
because, it's, like,

32:45.830 --> 32:47.665
hard being here,
but then when I was, like,

32:47.766 --> 32:49.835
counting the days,
I just...

32:49.934 --> 32:52.171
realized that there had been
a lot of days...

32:54.405 --> 32:56.008
...so I took a test...

32:57.042 --> 32:59.877
...and it is positive.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.880
(chuckling)

33:01.980 --> 33:04.282
("Right Here Waiting"
by Richard Marx playing)

33:04.383 --> 33:06.051
Oh, my God.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.487
But just to confirm...

33:11.789 --> 33:14.125
I took a few more
just to make sure.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.063
(laughing)

33:17.163 --> 33:20.531
But I'm pretty positive,
and so are these.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.568
(laughing)

33:23.669 --> 33:25.304
I love you so much.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.173
I love you, too.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.208
CASEY: I'm super happy,
but I don't know

33:29.307 --> 33:31.176
whether I'm gonna be able
to continue in this game.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.979
I just don't want this to...

33:34.079 --> 33:36.315
negatively impact Cohutta.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.817
I'm not gonna tell
the rest of the house.

33:38.916 --> 33:42.621
If I continue and make
this big shebang

33:42.721 --> 33:46.023
out of me having
this positive test,

33:46.125 --> 33:48.759
I don't know
if the rest of the house

33:48.859 --> 33:50.862
will continue
to vote in the way

33:50.961 --> 33:52.530
that they have already said
that they would.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.134
Hurry up and get your butt home.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.068
"Butts."

33:57.169 --> 33:59.238
There you go, "butts."

33:59.337 --> 34:00.905
All right, honey,
I love you so much.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.307
I love you too.
(kisses)

34:02.407 --> 34:04.309
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, bye.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.178
Bye.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.385
(music)

34:36.375 --> 34:39.545
All right, guys, we got up here
to this awkward...

34:39.644 --> 34:41.246
awkward scenario again.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.248
We all know this is
what it is at this point.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.016
It's a game,
so hard decisions

34:45.117 --> 34:46.952
have to be made
every single time.

34:47.052 --> 34:48.887
And I hate to be the one
that has to make them,

34:48.987 --> 34:50.722
but I love everybody
that's here,

34:50.822 --> 34:52.757
so every decision is hard.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.594
BRAD: We're getting close
to the end, and this is

34:55.693 --> 34:58.130
a hell of a place to be, uh,
the personal relationships

34:58.230 --> 35:00.898
in this house are worth more
than the opportunity to be here,

35:00.998 --> 35:02.501
but at the same time,
we all have something

35:02.601 --> 35:04.603
worth fighting for.
May the best person

35:04.702 --> 35:06.371
or persons win.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.039
(music)

35:08.139 --> 35:09.875
Just like Brad said,
it's getting late in the game.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.010
This is a shitty place
to be sitting.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.545
I'm not, again,
a beggar or a pleader

35:14.646 --> 35:16.014
or anything like that.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.916
I think that one thing
that I have proven

35:18.016 --> 35:19.885
in any challenge
I've ever been in is

35:19.985 --> 35:21.987
my word carries
a lot of weight,

35:22.086 --> 35:24.755
and I think that
I have tried to look out

35:24.856 --> 35:26.625
for your best interests
thus far,

35:26.724 --> 35:29.059
and I hope you know that
that would continue

35:29.161 --> 35:31.061
as long as
absolutely possible.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.864
And that's it
and that's all.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.601
I don't...

35:36.702 --> 35:39.070
For once,
I am speechless.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.608
I love you all.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.978
I don't have a whole lot
to say other than

35:48.079 --> 35:50.215
I've really been
enjoying this experience.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.717
Yeah, I'm just gonna
keep it at that.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.152
It's hard to win and then
have to be in that position

35:55.253 --> 35:58.923
to have to call out names,
so I respect that, and, um...

35:59.023 --> 36:02.960
I hold nothing against
anyone who says my name.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.530
I created Kings' Palace,

36:05.630 --> 36:08.099
and when I created that,
it was bigger than us.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.269
I use the term "king"
when referencing minorities.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.170
I use the term "king" to...

36:13.271 --> 36:15.840
have them be a reminder
that they come from royalty.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.476
That was for all of the people
who don't ever feel like

36:18.577 --> 36:21.179
they have representation
making it far in the game.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.780
Making it to the end.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.684
So I created that,
and there was backlash to it.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.418
At the end of the day,
it ended up putting

36:27.518 --> 36:29.688
a target on my back--
which I don't mind.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.523
And I represent it proudly,
and if I gotta go in,

36:32.623 --> 36:35.693
- I gotta go in.
- Yeah.
- Well said.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.365
This is hard.

36:40.465 --> 36:43.201
In the past,
I've always played

36:43.302 --> 36:45.936
with my heart
and my emotions,

36:46.036 --> 36:48.407
and it's gotten me
in trouble.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.641
So, my vote is

36:50.742 --> 36:53.411
gonna be for you,
Nehemiah and Melinda.

36:54.612 --> 36:57.349
My vote is
for Nehemiah and Melinda.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.251
I just wanna say, Nehemiah,

37:00.351 --> 37:02.688
I respect everything
you just said.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.590
And you created this kinship

37:04.690 --> 37:06.992
with this group of people
in your room,

37:07.092 --> 37:09.827
and for that reason,
I know that,

37:09.927 --> 37:13.197
if I'm sitting right there,
next to Laterrian,

37:13.298 --> 37:16.702
next to Teck,
I'm not gonna get your vote.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.704
And for that reason,
I'm gonna have to put Melinda

37:19.804 --> 37:21.507
and Nehemiah in.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.742
Yeah, we all know it's tough,
it's only gonna get harder,

37:24.842 --> 37:27.346
I mean, I got relationships
with both of y'all.

37:27.445 --> 37:30.382
And my vote is
for Nehemiah and Melinda.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.952
Well, it's you and me, Teck,

37:34.052 --> 37:36.487
and in the great words
of Ayanna,

37:36.588 --> 37:39.291
I slept in
my motherfucking uniform.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.927
- (laughter)
- 'Cause we about to get down,

37:42.027 --> 37:43.594
you know what I'm saying?

37:43.695 --> 37:45.931
I knew it was gonna happen,
and I came to play, baby.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.666
(laughter)

37:56.507 --> 37:59.210
Nehemiah and Melinda standing
between me and $500,000.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.347
It would take a miracle
for her to come out

38:01.447 --> 38:03.914
of that elimination arena
and still be in this game

38:04.014 --> 38:05.751
if it's up to me.

38:05.851 --> 38:08.219
It's your first time going in
twice in a season.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.088
Whoo, you're getting
your Challenge

38:10.188 --> 38:11.789
- little cherry popped.
- TECK: I am.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.324
Boy.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.094
NEHEMIAH: The camaraderie
and the friendships

38:16.193 --> 38:17.829
that we built
inside the Kings' Palace,

38:17.929 --> 38:20.998
it hurts to lose anyone,
especially this far in the game.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.434
But I'm coming for blood.

38:23.534 --> 38:25.637
Just so happens that
tonight is the King's blood,

38:25.737 --> 38:27.606
but I'm ready to do
what I need to do to make sure

38:27.706 --> 38:31.242
that Melinda and I continue
our journey in this game.

38:31.342 --> 38:33.378
This shit's hurting my heart.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.414
I was gonna say it--
say it once

38:35.514 --> 38:37.782
without trying to get all
in my fuckin' feelings and shit.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.650
I love you motherfuckers,
you made this shit

38:39.751 --> 38:42.186
so much better for me,
and to see y'all

38:42.286 --> 38:44.289
packing up and shit,
I can't take this shit.

38:44.389 --> 38:48.460
- Man...
- Like, my heart is hurting.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.260
It was hard
watching y'all pack.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.364
And I'm... I swear,
I swear, I swear.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.701
I swear,
if I get the chance

38:55.800 --> 38:58.103
to take it out on somebody,
I'm gonna fuckin' take it out

38:58.202 --> 39:00.005
on them, I swear,
this hurts me.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.606
- You took--
- Fuckin' hurts my heart.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.474
You took it out
on Tyler already, man.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.510
I don't care.
I got more to give.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.579
Yeah... just win that final.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.282
One of us gots
to win the final.

39:14.184 --> 39:17.088
(music)

39:25.130 --> 39:28.166
(music)

39:39.043 --> 39:41.679
All right, All-Stars,
welcome back to the Arena.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.014
(applause)

39:44.114 --> 39:46.952
First things first, we gotta
get our players out here,

39:47.052 --> 39:49.320
so we're gonna start off
with the losing players

39:49.420 --> 39:50.989
from the last challenge.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.923
That was Teck...

39:53.023 --> 39:55.927
(music)

39:56.027 --> 39:57.394
(applause)

39:57.496 --> 39:59.630
- Teck Money.
- And Ayanna.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.668
(music)

40:04.001 --> 40:05.637
(applause)

40:05.737 --> 40:08.273
Now, the team that
you selected to go against 'em:

40:08.373 --> 40:09.840
Nehemiah, come on out!

40:09.940 --> 40:13.210
(music)

40:16.981 --> 40:18.717
And Melinda!

40:18.817 --> 40:22.521
(music)

40:27.626 --> 40:29.894
All right,
I have some good news,

40:29.994 --> 40:31.630
and I have some bad news.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.300
The good news is...

40:36.400 --> 40:38.135
everyone down here is
still in the game.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.670
We're not having
an elimination tonight.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.507
Motherfucker!

40:42.172 --> 40:44.175
Whoa!

40:44.275 --> 40:45.710
Whoa...

40:45.811 --> 40:48.313
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
does the final begin now?

40:48.413 --> 40:50.014
We're really confused.
How is that possible?

40:50.114 --> 40:53.083
- Something doesn't feel right.
- Say what?

40:53.184 --> 40:55.052
Oh, hell yeah!

40:55.152 --> 40:57.255
Oh, hell yeah!
Cancelled.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.123
It's cancelled all around.
Nope, cancelled.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.626
Pack it up,
pack it up, pack it up.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.893
Take that shit back home,
we cancelled, baby.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.461
We are safe.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.197
- (gasping)
- The bad news is,

41:07.297 --> 41:09.300
we are still losing
a team tonight.

41:13.771 --> 41:16.206
It's come to my attention
that, Casey,

41:16.306 --> 41:18.510
you are no longer able
to compete.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.815
You okay?

41:26.684 --> 41:28.853
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, shit!

41:28.954 --> 41:32.023
(laughter)

41:32.123 --> 41:34.324
- (laughter)
- It's not mine.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.226
(laughing)

41:36.327 --> 41:38.396
- It's not mine.
- It's not Cohutta's.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.264
TJ: I said
you were bonded together.

41:40.364 --> 41:42.668
Unfortunately,
that means, Cohutta,

41:42.768 --> 41:44.302
- you have leave as well.
- I'm sorry.

41:44.402 --> 41:46.938
- It's okay.
- This is a team game.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.639
You both have to go home.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.942
I hope we see you both
in the future.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.342
Take care of yourselves.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.244
* Mama, I'm coming home *

41:54.344 --> 41:55.947
You're playing
a flawless game,

41:56.047 --> 41:57.715
the numbers are in your favor,

41:57.815 --> 42:00.451
the odds are in your corner,
getting along with everybody.

42:00.552 --> 42:02.853
Whoopsie.
Your partner's pregnant.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.190
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.

42:05.289 --> 42:08.594
Don't let the door hit ya
where the good Lord split ya.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.663
See ya.

42:11.762 --> 42:14.298
Oh, Casey, I will buy the baby
whatever the hell he needs!

42:14.398 --> 42:18.369
- Pampers, food!
- I will babysit!

42:18.469 --> 42:20.905
- Congratulations, Casey.
- Congratulations!

42:21.005 --> 42:23.608
CASEY: Look, as happy as I am
that I get to go home,

42:23.708 --> 42:25.710
and I get to see my fiancé...

42:25.811 --> 42:28.847
* I've seen your face
a hundred times... *

42:28.947 --> 42:32.717
I also know that Cohutta
really wanted to be here.

42:32.818 --> 42:35.452
He's never made it to a final,

42:35.552 --> 42:37.454
and, like, we were so close.

42:37.554 --> 42:38.989
Like, we had it in the bag.

42:39.090 --> 42:42.193
And I didn't want this
to negatively affect him.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.630
* Mama, I'm coming home *

42:44.730 --> 42:47.032
I love you, man,
I got you, Cohutta.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.934
Y'all give it hell.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.737
Some things in life...

42:51.836 --> 42:53.438
are bigger
than The Challenge,

42:53.538 --> 42:56.141
and starting your own family,

42:56.240 --> 42:59.344
no matter what inconvenient-ass
time that may occur,

42:59.443 --> 43:02.347
is one of those things, so...

43:02.447 --> 43:04.114
I'll take it for what it is.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.483
That being said,

43:06.583 --> 43:08.820
'hutta just lost half a mil.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.027
Well, just goes to show you,

43:17.128 --> 43:20.231
some people get eliminated
without even seeing the Arena.

43:20.331 --> 43:21.833
Oh, yeah.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.769
BRAD: To see both teams
from Kings' Palace coming back

43:24.869 --> 43:26.871
and to know that I'm the one
that put them there,

43:26.972 --> 43:28.806
I know this is not good
for my game.

43:28.907 --> 43:31.442
This game is a beast, and you
just have to adapt to it.

43:31.541 --> 43:34.079
I'll see you all very soon.
Be careful.

43:34.179 --> 43:35.480
- Take care.
- (applause)

43:35.579 --> 43:37.081
TECK:
This is a beautiful day.

43:37.181 --> 43:39.885
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

43:39.985 --> 43:41.585
Uh! Uh! Uh!

43:41.686 --> 43:44.021
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

43:44.121 --> 43:45.856
* You'll never take us
alive, baby *

43:45.956 --> 43:49.327
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

43:49.427 --> 43:50.996
* Kings' Palace, baby! *

43:51.096 --> 43:53.563
* Save the Palace,
Save the Palace *

43:53.664 --> 43:55.199
* Anyone come challenge, we... *

43:55.300 --> 43:58.202
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

43:58.302 --> 44:00.105
* Save the... *

44:00.204 --> 44:02.639
* Save the Palace,
save the Palace *

44:02.740 --> 44:04.842
* Anyone come
challenge, we... *

44:04.943 --> 44:07.077
* Either you're with us
or against us **

44:12.349 --> 44:13.719
TJ: Today's challenge is
called Dive and Conquer.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.385
Let's eat, Ayanna,
come on, let's eat, I'm excited!

44:15.485 --> 44:17.722
Dig deep right now,
let's go! You all right?

44:17.822 --> 44:20.557
- I'm gonna re-center myself.
- Mental health day.

44:20.657 --> 44:22.327
AYANNA:
I got a little petty in me.

44:22.427 --> 44:23.829
I'm not gonna Tonya Harding you.

44:23.929 --> 44:25.630
This is really weird and creepy.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.565
You don't listen
to anybody in this house!

44:27.664 --> 44:30.101
I don't know what to do
with Ayanna, I'm about to break.

44:35.072 --> 44:37.809
(music)
