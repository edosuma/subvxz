00:21.976 --> 00:24.148
Hey, clark,how are you holding up?

00:24.594 --> 00:27.213
Just enjoying the view.
From the bench.

00:27.248 --> 00:31.233
Right, listen, I talked to coach quigley about you.
But you know him. He's old school.

00:31.257 --> 00:35.554
He already feels like he's gota squad for the season.
But just, uh, hang in there for me, all right?

00:37.644 --> 00:39.828
Go on in, guys. Grab a drink.

00:39.864 --> 00:41.390
Nice catch, buddy!

00:41.422 --> 00:44.032
It's all about you and me this year, bro!

00:44.067 --> 00:46.934
All right, cut it out,mandy. Just cut it out.

00:47.204 --> 00:48.695
Sorry.

00:49.376 --> 00:51.008
So, what are wedoing saturday night?

00:51.032 --> 00:54.402
Uh, "we" aren't doing anything.
I'm hanging out with nate and the boys.

00:54.449 --> 00:57.283
Didn't I mention that to you before?

00:58.249 --> 01:00.950
It's okay.
I just want to make you happy,

01:00.997 --> 01:03.251
All right.
I got you a drink.

You know what?

01:27.332 --> 01:28.706
Screw the guys.

01:31.375 --> 01:33.899
I wanna hang out with you on saturday night.

01:34.932 --> 01:37.375
Well, why wait till Saturday when we can go shopping now?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.216
Whatever you want, baby.

01:39.263 --> 01:40.801
I'm gonna go hit the showers.

01:45.450 --> 01:48.376
- Where are you going, bud?The field's this way.
- I'm going shopping with mandy.

01:48.411 --> 01:49.515
You what?

01:49.879 --> 01:52.415
- I'll be in the car, baby.
- See ya.

01:54.529 --> 01:57.920
- You checking out my girlfriend, buddy?
- What are you talking about?

02:02.974 --> 02:05.898
Danny, you walk off this field,you're on the bench friday!

02:05.921 --> 02:07.001
Eat me, dude!

02:07.048 --> 02:10.229
Clark, looks like a spot just opened up.
Why don't you hop in there?

02:12.645 --> 02:13.538
Go get 'em.

02:14.254 --> 02:15.217
Clark.

02:15.428 --> 02:16.931
You're gonna need one of these.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.600
Don't get too comfortable out there, clark.

02:22.717 --> 02:25.230
Danny's this team'squarterback.

02:28.659 --> 02:29.983
Let's get 'em, boys.

02:30.019 --> 02:30.758
Yeah.

02:30.794 --> 02:33.929
Blue-19!
I'm not the center, jerk.

02:37.731 --> 02:39.938
Blue-19!
Hike!

02:49.942 --> 02:52.091
Nice throw, kent!Keep it up!

02:53.194 --> 02:54.380
All right!

02:54.881 --> 02:56.481
Boy's locker room.

03:27.432 --> 03:31.090
- put the gun down, man. Let's talk about this.
- It's too late, coach.

03:31.138 --> 03:34.598
You shouldn't have hit on my girl.

www. forom. com

05:06.199 --> 05:08.784
- ow, ow, ow.
- I haven't even touched it yet.

05:09.114 --> 05:13.176
- I'm just practicing.
- Good, because it's really deep.

05:18.081 --> 05:22.309
Well, I guess it could've been a lot worse...
if clark hadn't tackled me out of the way.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.544
I've never seen anybody move that
fast. I gotta get him off the bench.

05:25.599 --> 05:30.158
Of course, that shouldn't be hard now. Do they
still expel students for taking potshots at coaches?

05:30.231 --> 05:32.658
- This isn't funny, jason.
- Right.

05:32.768 --> 05:36.533
Imagine being your girlfriend and
finding out about this from chloe.

05:36.604 --> 05:42.930
I felt faint and I wanted to scream, but I couldn't because
why would lana be freaking outover the new assistant coach?

05:46.089 --> 05:51.916
You know, this is usually the part where I would buy you a massive
bouquet of flowers and take you out to a really nice dinner, but

05:51.971 --> 05:56.016
I can't, because my dad just cut me off.

05:56.144 --> 06:00.538
Because I decided to follow my heart
instead of the big bucks at business school.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.839
Hey.
I need this job,

06:04.899 --> 06:09.145
okay? I mean, it's something I love, you know,
and it works well with my college schedule.

06:09.457 --> 06:11.406
It allows me
to be close to you.

06:11.461 --> 06:14.861
I know the only downside is that we
have to fly under the radar, but...

06:15.450 --> 06:16.920
I'm sorry for that.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.570
It's just
I've never been happier.

06:32.416 --> 06:36.953
And to not be able
to share that is frustrating.

06:37.339 --> 06:40.593
Well, you know you can always
take your frustration out on me.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.281
Well, can you please tell the dean
there's been an egregious error?

06:52.318 --> 06:57.428
I belong at metropolis university,
not walking the halls of podunk high.

06:57.648 --> 07:01.958
Well, yes, I'm sure that we could work this all
out if you could just get him to call me back.

07:01.981 --> 07:02.840
Thank you.

07:02.876 --> 07:04.123
You know,

07:04.181 --> 07:09.040
if you spent as much time studying as you did trying
to leave, you'd be in college already.

07:09.205 --> 07:12.510
And where'd you get that pearl of wisdom
- the farmer's almanac?

07:13.228 --> 07:15.464
So, what do you think?

07:16.028 --> 07:17.875
They're not really
your colors.

07:18.546 --> 07:20.758
They're
the school's colors.

07:21.087 --> 07:24.649
I'm glad you made the team,
clark, but why be a conformist?

07:24.685 --> 07:30.143
At least with the whole farm boy plaid thing -
as lame as it is -it completely belongs to you.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.912
In the future, let's restrict our conversations
to "hello" and "goodbye. "

07:36.098 --> 07:38.132
And those thighs?
1, 2, 3...

07:38.177 --> 07:39.648
- No!
- No!

07:43.045 --> 07:45.427
Yeah, so the party'sgonna be way kick.

07:51.822 --> 07:55.689
Where are we -
some kind of freakish feminist parallel universe?

07:57.822 --> 08:00.595
Hey, chloe, have you seen the way these football players
are acting?

08:00.625 --> 08:04.183
Yeah, and I noticed one of them unloaded a shotgun
in the boys' locker room.

08:04.213 --> 08:08.845
I was thinking about maybe doing an article on it,
but the only two reporters I have are late again.

08:08.992 --> 08:11.652
Oh, hi. It's you.

08:11.696 --> 08:15.784
Sorry. I was storming the gates of metropolis U.,
Trying to get them to change their admissions policy.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.872
And I had to pick up my new jacket.
What do you think?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.958
It's not exactly your colors.

08:21.679 --> 08:23.296
It's the school colors.

08:23.326 --> 08:26.561
Whatever. Anyway, lois,
I need you to go to the smallville medical center.

08:26.588 --> 08:29.662
Apparently, our gun-totingex-quarterback
woke up this morning

08:29.691 --> 08:33.456
and he's feeling the sting of second-degree burns.
He's been apologizing nonstop, so...

08:33.485 --> 08:38.220
I'm sure he doesn't love the prospect of playing
tight end for the Kansas state boys' home.

08:40.392 --> 08:41.421
Hello?

08:42.332 --> 08:44.068
Yes, I will hold for the dean.

08:44.111 --> 08:45.715
I've gotta go

08:45.788 --> 08:49.730
All right, I guess I'll goto smallville medical center.
Clark, I need you to talk to coach teague.

08:49.774 --> 08:53.421
After all, you were there. Nice save, by the way.

08:54.956 --> 08:56.574
Actually, chloe,

08:56.632 --> 08:58.662
with this whole football thing,

08:58.765 --> 09:01.529
I'm gonna have to dial back my time at the "torch. "

09:06.294 --> 09:07.098
Oh.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.465
I guess I've got my work cut out for me.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.304
I'm sorry.

09:14.774 --> 09:15.877
You know,

09:15.936 --> 09:18.272
- my priorities
- you know what?

09:18.316 --> 09:19.728
Don't worry about it.

09:19.757 --> 09:23.507
This has gotta bea pretty big deal for you.
I mean, you're the new starting quarterback, right?

09:23.566 --> 09:25.125
It's gotta be pretty exciting.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.742
It is, but...

09:28.225 --> 09:30.049
I'm just not sure the other guys want me around.

09:30.078 --> 09:32.269
They've been playing together for three years.

09:32.299 --> 09:34.767
You're on the team for two weeks,
and all of a sudden,you're starting?

09:34.797 --> 09:37.223
What'd you expect -hugs and kisses?

09:41.356 --> 09:42.370
Nice.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.474
What's going on?

09:53.239 --> 09:56.224
You owe me one, clark.
I saved it from the toilet.

09:56.338 --> 09:57.676
Thanks.

10:00.602 --> 10:02.426
All right, ladies,listen up.

10:02.676 --> 10:05.117
You've obviously found the new jerseys.

10:05.161 --> 10:09.085
I want to introduce you to the man
responsible for 'em -lex luthor!

10:15.953 --> 10:19.336
The coaches tell me this is going to be a rebuilding season,

10:20.483 --> 10:22.616
and I want to encourage you to keep at it.

10:23.454 --> 10:25.542
In my life,I've learned that

10:26.025 --> 10:29.172
you can never give upon something
that means a lot to you,

10:30.437 --> 10:32.804
even when you're coming off a losing season.

10:33.481 --> 10:35.010
You keep trying.

10:36.642 --> 10:39.098
Because sometimes you just need a fresh start.

10:44.363 --> 10:46.010
So, please,

10:46.201 --> 10:47.613
enjoy the new uniforms.

10:47.657 --> 10:48.848
All right, all right!

10:56.096 --> 10:57.714
I know what you're doing.

10:59.903 --> 11:01.815
But you can't buy back my friendship.

11:10.815 --> 11:11.935
Coach teague,

11:11.979 --> 11:12.626
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:12.655 --> 11:17.008
I'm doing a story on the "torch" on dan cormier and I was
just wondering if I could talk to you for a little bit.

11:17.037 --> 11:18.699
Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a practice.

11:18.743 --> 11:20.611
It's only gonna take,like, two seconds, I promise.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.123
- I'll do it later.
- Okay.

11:22.153 --> 11:23.741
- I will.
- Okay.

11:31.505 --> 11:32.917
Hi, ladies.

11:35.230 --> 11:38.803
Gee, coach, I sure hope you have someone special
in your life.

11:38.847 --> 11:42.185
Well, mandy, I don't think that’s any of your business.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.129
But, yeah,I do have somebody.

11:55.945 --> 11:58.847
guys,
you gotta give your quarterback some protection.

11:58.876 --> 12:02.185
You gotta hold the pocket.
Come on, carlsen,you gotta move around!

12:02.229 --> 12:03.876
Hey, clark, hi.

12:03.906 --> 12:06.510
I know you’re not exactly
journalistically inclined right now, but...

12:06.542 --> 12:08.474
this isn't a good time, chloe.

12:08.523 --> 12:09.618
Right.

12:10.132 --> 12:11.456
Priorities.

12:27.521 --> 12:30.403
Blue-23!
Blue-23!

12:30.447 --> 12:31.623
- Clark...
- Hut!

12:34.138 --> 12:35.476
Hello...

12:35.847 --> 12:39.715
uh, look, I'm gonna need you
to run with that psycho quarterback story.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.935
You might want to interview his girlfriend mandy.
She's a cheerleader.

12:43.112 --> 12:46.318
Hi, I'm busy trying to get out of mayberry.

12:46.421 --> 12:49.125
That's fine. Do whatever you want.
You're in charge now.

12:49.345 --> 12:51.228
I'm quitting the "torch. "

12:51.331 --> 12:52.360
Whoa,

12:52.478 --> 12:53.551
wait.

12:53.669 --> 12:54.786
Quitting?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.255
Why?

12:56.299 --> 12:59.725
I finally understand why it never worked with clark.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.887
Okay, I'll bite.

13:01.931 --> 13:04.461
Because I was never there for him.

13:04.505 --> 13:08.505
I was always here,
buried in this stupid school newspaper.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.375
I wasn't devoted to him,

13:11.419 --> 13:13.669
but that's all gonna change now.

13:15.433 --> 13:19.169
Please stop with your crazy talk.
You can't quit because,

13:19.213 --> 13:22.240
seriously,
I need the credits,and...

13:22.652 --> 13:25.475
how many anvils are you gonna let this guy drop on you?

13:27.358 --> 13:29.020
You know what's crazy?

13:30.314 --> 13:32.540
I actually thought you’d be happy for me.

13:32.569 --> 13:36.510
Now that lana and clark are finally a thing of the past,
I may actually have a shot at this.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.554
Why are you getting in my way?

13:38.907 --> 13:39.951
Fine.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.642
Looks like I'm gonna be covering the pom-pom beat.

13:44.701 --> 13:45.993
Thank you.

13:52.963 --> 13:58.550
Seriously, mandy, the 24-hourmourning period's over.
You need a new boyfriend to take to our pool party.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.756
Okay, I'm not taking a step down from dan
and dating some wide receiver, rhonda.

14:02.785 --> 14:05.035
Well, clark kent's the new quarterback.

14:05.079 --> 14:06.665
And he's hot.

14:07.165 --> 14:08.444
No decisions.

14:08.488 --> 14:09.812
I'll scope him out.

14:11.797 --> 14:13.120
Mandy, right?

14:13.165 --> 14:17.076
I'm lois lane. I'm doing an article for the
"torch" about what happened to your boyfriend.

14:17.351 --> 14:18.889
She doesn't want to talk about it.

14:18.913 --> 14:20.979
I don't want to write the article, either,
but

14:21.008 --> 14:23.450
my cousin dumped it on me and I need the credits,
so let's...

14:23.474 --> 14:25.564
I wouldn't give that geek rag a quote

14:25.587 --> 14:28.417
if it were the last paper on earth.
Darn,

14:28.781 --> 14:31.280
and I thought it was gonna be so insightful.

14:33.252 --> 14:34.356
Oh, look,

14:34.532 --> 14:36.455
your valets are here...

14:38.287 --> 14:40.459
except you don't have one anymore, do you?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.768
I could have another boyfriend... like that.

14:43.803 --> 14:47.431
It's amazing what a short skirt and the ability to run
will get ya.

14:53.132 --> 14:54.732
The love molecule.

14:54.785 --> 14:56.158
Oh, advanced chem.

14:56.193 --> 14:59.458
How many cheerleaders does it take
to draw a double helix?

15:00.477 --> 15:02.297
- You want a quote?
- Yeah.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.657
Back off... bitch.

15:11.974 --> 15:13.782
Just got my headline.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.738
Chloe...

15:28.674 --> 15:30.059
what's going on?

15:40.584 --> 15:41.499
So...

15:41.878 --> 15:46.056
remember that conversation we had this morning
about your priorities?

15:46.081 --> 15:51.292
Well, I've been thinking about my priorities,
and I think they're all screwed up.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.578
Who needs the "torch"?
Especially if you're not going to be there.

15:57.651 --> 15:58.884
Right.

16:02.019 --> 16:05.241
But that still doesn't answer
why you're only wearing...

16:05.288 --> 16:06.956
my football jersey.

16:06.979 --> 16:10.138
I wanna make you my number-one priority.

16:11.347 --> 16:13.249
I would do anything for you.

16:14.188 --> 16:16.478
Things that lana would never do.

16:16.666 --> 16:19.249
Things to help relieve your stress.

16:20.623 --> 16:22.018
Like what?

16:25.564 --> 16:26.820
Chloe...

16:27.208 --> 16:29.850
chloe! Hey, chloe.
Are...

16:30.495 --> 16:33.757
- Are you feeling okay?
- I've never felt happier.

16:33.898 --> 16:35.189
Clark.

16:35.424 --> 16:38.031
- Uh...
- Can't you see?

16:38.829 --> 16:40.649
I'm devoted to you.

16:40.682 --> 16:42.784
I love you, clark.

16:53.376 --> 16:54.116
clark,

16:54.139 --> 16:58.002
I got all your football gear together,
but I can't find your jersey.

16:59.399 --> 17:00.844
Its, uh, in the barn.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.922
I forgot it up there.
I'll, uh...

17:02.995 --> 17:04.507
I'll get it later.

17:06.606 --> 17:08.558
Hey, mom, can I talk to you for a second?

17:08.602 --> 17:10.715
Of course, honey. What's up?

17:11.361 --> 17:12.873
It's about chloe.

17:15.263 --> 17:17.743
Um, she came onto me last night.
Pretty strong.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.212
I'm worried about her.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.148
Don't worry,nothing happened.

17:21.179 --> 17:23.204
I thought you two agreed to be friends.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.246
We did...

17:24.272 --> 17:26.386
and then pulled a 180° on me.

17:26.415 --> 17:31.450
Maybe chloe's decided life’s too short
to bury her feelings anymore.

17:31.479 --> 17:33.167
How do you feel about her?

17:33.196 --> 17:35.603
The problem is,I'm not over lana yet.

17:36.616 --> 17:38.781
Sometimes, I think I never will be.

17:40.395 --> 17:42.054
Oh, sweetheart,

17:42.450 --> 17:45.620
there's somebody out there for you.
I know it.

17:46.428 --> 17:48.277
So, what do I do about chloe?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.342
If you don't feel the same way,

17:52.516 --> 17:54.160
just be honest.

17:56.273 --> 17:58.387
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:58.622 --> 18:01.452
Oh, I gotta get to the talon.
Okay,

18:01.848 --> 18:03.903
um,I'll see you two later.

18:04.372 --> 18:05.268
Bye.

18:05.708 --> 18:06.633
Bye.

18:08.027 --> 18:09.275
So, clark,

18:10.389 --> 18:11.469
tell me,

18:11.528 --> 18:13.500
how's football practice going?

18:15.357 --> 18:17.470
It's actually not going so good.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.568
Some of the guys have been giving me a hard time
since they found out I was starting.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.664
- Missing my passes...
- nobody said it was gonna be easy.

18:26.944 --> 18:29.515
The frustrating part is,I could score every time.

18:29.548 --> 18:30.699
Clark,

18:30.881 --> 18:33.006
we talked about that whole thing, remember?

18:33.358 --> 18:37.249
The football field is not a place
for you to be using your powers to save the day.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.316
I just said it was frustrating.

18:39.410 --> 18:43.014
Look, son, if you're gonna be the quarterback,
then you have to be the leader.

18:43.449 --> 18:47.875
Of course,a bunch of the guys are gonna want to challenge
that, especially if they don't think you deserve it.

18:47.911 --> 18:49.572
Same thing happened to me.

18:51.075 --> 18:53.482
I thought your team worshipped
the groundyou walked on.

18:53.564 --> 18:56.840
Well, not when I was a sophomore, they didn'T.

18:57.263 --> 18:59.856
See, the coach made me starting quarterback.

18:59.914 --> 19:02.310
A bunch of the seniors didn’t like that very much.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.550
What did you do?

19:05.926 --> 19:07.698
I earned their respect.

19:19.939 --> 19:21.900
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Hey.

19:23.321 --> 19:24.683
Yeah. It is now.

19:25.481 --> 19:27.604
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's called kissing my girlfriend.

19:27.639 --> 19:30.305
You know, I was talking more in the "big picture" sense.

19:32.418 --> 19:35.844
The ladyfrom the attendance office
announced to my entire

19:35.879 --> 19:39.296
advanced lit class
that coach Teague needed to see me.

19:40.200 --> 19:40.917
Okay.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.494
I don't want you to take this the wrong way,

19:44.529 --> 19:47.899
but this sudden,spontaneous outburst...

19:47.934 --> 19:50.409
it's a little strange,even for you.

19:50.494 --> 19:54.343
You have sacrificed an incredible amount
to be with me.

19:54.554 --> 19:56.503
I will not cost you your job.

19:56.527 --> 19:59.448
My job doesn't matter, okay?You do.
I wanna make you happy.

19:59.472 --> 20:00.411
I know,

20:00.951 --> 20:02.102
and I love that.

20:04.509 --> 20:06.561
I just think that we should discuss this later.

20:06.597 --> 20:08.651
Okay, but will you promise me something?

20:09.215 --> 20:10.178
Depends...

20:10.213 --> 20:11.810
come by practice after school.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.511
Just stand on the sideline for, like, 10 minutes,
but I just

20:14.628 --> 20:15.951
wanna see you.

20:19.896 --> 20:22.808
All right, guys, let's graba drink before scrimmage.

20:32.383 --> 20:33.263
Lana?

20:34.402 --> 20:35.623
What are you doing here?

20:36.126 --> 20:40.693
I-I heard that clark kent was our new starting quarterback.
I had to see it for myself.

20:40.752 --> 20:41.785
Really.

20:42.313 --> 20:44.286
You came out hereto watch me practice?

20:45.636 --> 20:46.831
That means a lot.

20:52.221 --> 20:54.710
Hey, kent! You wanna join us or what?

20:55.945 --> 20:56.907
I better go.

20:56.934 --> 20:59.752
Seems like our new assistant coach
is working you pretty hard.

21:00.069 --> 21:02.722
No, uh, he's actually pretty cool.

21:06.657 --> 21:07.585
I'll see you.

21:07.632 --> 21:08.853
See ya.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.450
Hey,

21:10.814 --> 21:13.467
what did you do to my cousin?
She's freaking me out.

21:13.490 --> 21:15.345
Nothing. She's hitting on me.

21:15.381 --> 21:18.398
Well, obviously, you sent some kind of signal
that you were interested.

21:18.433 --> 21:21.463
Look, lois, I gota big game coming up,
and I'm trying to make a good impression here, all right?

21:21.486 --> 21:23.245
So could we talk about this later?

21:23.268 --> 21:24.313
Hey,

21:24.490 --> 21:25.593
Hey, clark!

21:25.628 --> 21:27.155
- Hi!
- Oh, my god.

21:27.190 --> 21:29.292
Hi, clark! Hi!Ha ha!

21:29.656 --> 21:30.959
Ta-da!

21:31.133 --> 21:32.155
Hi!

21:33.071 --> 21:35.537
Chloe, what's up with the cheerleader outfit?

21:35.572 --> 21:37.744
I found it in the storage locker.

21:37.779 --> 21:40.386
I thought, you know,what better way
to support my...

21:40.409 --> 21:43.921
new favorite starting quarterback
than to joint he cheerleading squad?

21:43.953 --> 21:45.972
We can be together all the time.

21:46.099 --> 21:47.144
Yeah...

21:52.298 --> 21:53.707
what is she doing here?

21:55.387 --> 21:57.481
Hey, kent!Sometime today.

21:57.886 --> 21:58.731
Okay.

21:58.755 --> 21:59.694
Good luck!

21:59.788 --> 22:00.668
Bye.

22:00.809 --> 22:03.721
Oh, my god, she's taken the fast train to step ford.

22:03.745 --> 22:05.259
I need you to keep her away from me.

22:05.310 --> 22:07.541
With what -a tranquilizer gun?

22:07.564 --> 22:10.934
There's obviously something wrong.
I just need some time to figure it out, okay?

22:11.463 --> 22:12.529
Okay.

22:26.468 --> 22:28.440
Kent, what's wrong with you?

22:29.626 --> 22:31.620
Coach, I'm not feeling very good.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.416
I think I better leave.

22:33.451 --> 22:35.858
You're gonna walk away because you don't feel well.

22:35.891 --> 22:38.028
You know, maybe I was wrong about you, kent.

22:38.474 --> 22:39.801
Coach, I...

22:40.083 --> 22:43.781
you know, your team's waiting for you out there.
Are you a leader or not?

22:51.299 --> 22:54.252
Tell the rest of the guys
they got a green light on kent.

22:54.299 --> 22:56.551
I've been too easy on him.

23:08.398 --> 23:10.500
It's okay, clark, it's okay!Just shake it off!

23:10.535 --> 23:12.320
How's it taste?

23:15.990 --> 23:19.336
Best on the team -clark kent!
Come on, gimme a "k"

23:19.371 --> 23:21.802
- Gimme an "e"! Gimme an "n"!
- Blue-37! Hike!

23:21.825 --> 23:23.411
Gimme a "t"!

23:25.063 --> 23:25.944
Oh!

23:26.144 --> 23:29.149
Keep going, baby!Taking one for the team!

23:30.652 --> 23:32.058
Need a hand?

23:32.082 --> 23:35.181
You're the number one quaterback! Yeah!

23:37.401 --> 23:40.322
Blue-17! Hut!

23:41.496 --> 23:42.859
Oh! Oh!

23:42.882 --> 23:45.688
It's okay!It's okay! It's okay!It's just a bruise!

23:46.316 --> 23:48.321
Attaboy, kent.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.574
Attaboy, kent.

23:52.161 --> 23:55.660
You can do it!You can do it!

23:55.704 --> 23:59.434
Defense! Go, defense!Yeah, defense!
All right! Whoo! Yeah!

24:00.037 --> 24:01.810
Go, clark!

24:14.215 --> 24:15.446
Chloe,

24:15.504 --> 24:18.146
if that's you, I'm not feeling very well right now.

24:20.612 --> 24:22.033
Hey, coach teague.

24:22.056 --> 24:23.289
Clark, we need to talk.

24:23.312 --> 24:26.492
Look, I know this is gonna sound weird,
but I think there's something in that drink cooler.

24:26.527 --> 24:28.382
Yeah, you should've stayed away from my girlfriend.

24:28.406 --> 24:29.897
What are you talking about?

25:18.795 --> 25:19.899
Clark...

25:20.991 --> 25:21.989
Lex.

25:22.012 --> 25:23.151
Are you okay?

25:23.186 --> 25:24.724
Who was that?

25:32.715 --> 25:35.064
Are you sure you don’t want to call the police?

25:35.953 --> 25:38.537
It's not like either of us got a good look at him, anyway.

26:00.505 --> 26:01.621
That's odd.

26:01.668 --> 26:02.455
What?

26:02.501 --> 26:05.261
I could've sworn there was a cut above your eye.

26:05.918 --> 26:07.125
Actually,

26:07.830 --> 26:09.603
I'm feeling a lot better all of a sudden.

26:09.638 --> 26:12.526
Yeah, well, I still think you should have a doctor
take a look at you.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.311
I'm just lucky you were here.

26:16.955 --> 26:18.552
Why are you here?

26:18.622 --> 26:20.583
I wanted to give you something.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.229
It's every file I ever had on you.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.542
How do I know you don't have a copy?

26:31.280 --> 26:32.395
You don'T.

26:32.748 --> 26:33.945
But it's the truth.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.305
Lex, if this friendship was so important,

26:37.315 --> 26:39.483
why'd you lie to me for so long?

26:40.270 --> 26:41.878
I don't know, clark.

26:43.933 --> 26:47.315
There's a darkness in me that I can't always control.

26:48.395 --> 26:50.912
I'm starting to think that’s my curse...

26:51.065 --> 26:53.894
why every relationship I have ends badly.

26:55.362 --> 26:58.448
- We all have a dark side, lex.
- Yeah.

26:59.375 --> 27:02.780
But I can feel mine creeping over the corners.

27:04.366 --> 27:07.052
Your friendship helps keep it at bay.

27:07.757 --> 27:10.962
It reminds me that there are truly good people in the world.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.623
I'm not one to give up on that.

27:19.989 --> 27:21.407
Good night, clark.

27:31.883 --> 27:34.384
I'm looking for coach teague. He just attacked me in my loft.

27:34.419 --> 27:36.591
After that performance on the field today,

27:36.650 --> 27:38.051
I'm not surprised.

27:38.463 --> 27:39.703
I'm kidding.

27:39.726 --> 27:44.550
Look, the cheerleaders are spiking the water cooler at
practice. That's why Chloe and the players are acting so weird.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.295
Nice work, smallville.

27:46.353 --> 27:48.018
You want to know what they're using?

27:49.054 --> 27:52.230
You actually did some investigative reporting?

27:52.503 --> 27:55.321
My cousin goes martha Stewart without the jail time?
Yeah.

27:55.357 --> 27:58.067
Suddenly, the power of the press interests me.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.544
Look what I found.

28:01.390 --> 28:04.278
Mandy and rhonda did a science fair project together.

28:04.795 --> 28:05.862
So?

28:06.684 --> 28:08.774
So that'sour smoking gun.

28:08.797 --> 28:13.177
According to the chemistry teacher,
they researched a hormone called phenylithamine.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.417
Phenylithamine.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.065
- "The love molecule. "
- Exactly.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.294
- So it's a love potion?
- Yeah, but it didn't work.

28:22.447 --> 28:24.408
Until they added the meteor rock.

28:24.617 --> 28:25.403
Whatever.

28:25.439 --> 28:27.165
We have to find a way to reverse the effect.

28:27.188 --> 28:30.605
Well, it must wear off at some point.
Otherwise, they wouldn't keep juicing the football players.

28:30.628 --> 28:34.538
We don't have enough time. What if another player
goes into a jealous rage and hurts someone?

28:35.857 --> 28:37.031
Wait a minute.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.532
You drank some of it, too.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.187
I saw you.

28:42.984 --> 28:45.083
How come you're not going all love slave?

28:46.140 --> 28:47.209
I don't know.

28:47.864 --> 28:48.928
What's your point?

28:48.976 --> 28:51.739
That science report’ sin mandy's faux prada bag.

28:51.774 --> 28:54.298
Presumably it can tell us how to reverse this, right?

28:54.322 --> 28:57.469
And presumably, you’re infected.

28:59.670 --> 29:02.124
The cheerleaders are having a pool party tonight.

29:02.159 --> 29:04.566
How do you lookin a swimsuit, clark?

29:41.129 --> 29:42.303
Okay, clark,

29:42.338 --> 29:44.675
prada bag, folder.
Showtime.

29:44.698 --> 29:46.295
Lois, I don't think...

29:46.518 --> 29:47.540
Lois

29:55.314 --> 29:56.571
Hi, mandy.

29:56.594 --> 29:58.074
Hey, clark.

29:58.684 --> 30:00.316
Welcome to the party.

30:10.144 --> 30:11.962
I'm devoted to you.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.621
Yeah, I can work with this.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.284
Lois.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.924
Oh, you're so strong.

30:47.321 --> 30:49.270
Y-you're so beautiful.

30:49.998 --> 30:50.985
So...

31:00.816 --> 31:01.979
So...

31:02.105 --> 31:03.514
tell me,

31:03.549 --> 31:05.264
since you like me so much,

31:05.299 --> 31:07.166
what are you gonna do for me?

31:07.471 --> 31:08.868
I'll buy you dinner.

31:13.253 --> 31:14.192
I'll cook

31:14.216 --> 31:17.738
- I'll cook you dinner.
- Oh, that is so hot!

31:28.234 --> 31:29.866
You seem distracted.

31:29.913 --> 31:32.672
- Um, I'm just nervous.
- Why?

31:33.415 --> 31:34.519
I've, um,

31:34.566 --> 31:37.525
never done
what I think we’re about to do before.

32:00.472 --> 32:01.705
What?

32:01.870 --> 32:02.891
Oh!

32:02.912 --> 32:04.814
- Ooh!
- Oh! Ooh!

32:36.034 --> 32:37.372
Gross

32:38.899 --> 32:40.284
All right...

32:45.799 --> 32:48.335
- Chloe,what the hell?
- I know what you're up to!

32:48.358 --> 32:50.707
I went through this with lana,
and I'm not gonna go through it with you!

32:51.916 --> 32:53.548
Steal clark!

32:53.910 --> 32:55.201
Are you getting bored?

32:55.236 --> 32:56.857
- No.
- Good.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.346
Because I'm just getting started.

33:04.453 --> 33:06.132
Chloe, this is stupid!

33:06.848 --> 33:08.609
I don't want to hurt you!

33:10.147 --> 33:12.120
Too late. You already did.

33:16.446 --> 33:18.325
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.192
- Are you okay, chloe?
- Yeah.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.648
What happened?

33:21.671 --> 33:23.209
What’s going on?

33:32.084 --> 33:32.953
So...

33:33.387 --> 33:35.721
- how far do you want to go here?
- Um...

33:36.508 --> 33:38.786
right about there would be great, thanks.

33:46.875 --> 33:48.660
- Chloe, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:48.683 --> 33:51.220
- I can't believe you,clark.
- Oh, please,

33:51.255 --> 33:55.126
do you know how pathetic it is that you had to
resort to chemicals to control your boyfriend?

33:55.149 --> 33:57.145
I'm sick of being a distant second to a football.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.670
So you created a bunch of psycho nut jobs.

33:59.987 --> 34:01.079
No offense.

34:01.384 --> 34:02.394
None taken.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.965
What took you so long?

34:05.004 --> 34:08.620
Oh, she was attacked by a, uh, crazy plumber.

34:09.735 --> 34:10.581
Yeah.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.525
Did you find the cure?

34:13.561 --> 34:16.344
Yeah, we worked out our own little experiment.

34:17.893 --> 34:21.909
I accidentally burned her on the furnace in the boiler room,
and she snapped out of it.

34:22.382 --> 34:24.837
Just like dan snapped out of it when the gun heated up.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.304
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

34:26.927 --> 34:28.958
- So it's the heat.
- Yeah.

34:29.897 --> 34:31.257
Uh, you guys, whe...

34:31.292 --> 34:32.560
where's mandy?

34:34.297 --> 34:37.139
- Oh, nice, clark.
- You know, you only have one thing to do.

34:37.163 --> 34:38.641
Me? You're closer to the door.

34:38.677 --> 34:42.525
- Okay, so it's automatically my fault?
- Uh, guys, guys, guys.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.567
Oh, hey, we were just talking about you.

34:45.601 --> 34:48.385
Yeah? Well, now you're gonna wish you never crossed me.

34:48.402 --> 34:50.047
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

34:50.081 --> 34:51.667
Cheer us to death?

34:53.369 --> 34:55.996
Oh, great, here comes the love squad.

35:08.922 --> 35:10.376
Let's get outta here.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.585
Come on, lois.

35:11.632 --> 35:13.311
Bring it on, hotshot.

35:16.059 --> 35:17.738
lois,what are you doing?

35:17.761 --> 35:20.541
Hey, clark, you got any explosions up your sleeve?

35:20.565 --> 35:22.749
You're gonna pay, bitch!

35:35.535 --> 35:37.214
Okay, what the hell was that?

35:38.928 --> 35:41.511
I guess the pipe must've broken or something.

35:42.062 --> 35:43.401
Pretty lucky, huh?

35:45.209 --> 35:48.875
Yeah. You better hope for that kind of luck tomorrow
on the field.

35:58.376 --> 36:01.805
When they told me Clark kent was downstairs,
I couldn't believe it.

36:04.940 --> 36:08.490
I wanted you to see for yourself
that the investigation is over.

36:11.090 --> 36:12.358
What's that?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.767
The Porsche you pulled me out of the day we met.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.564
Why is it still here?

36:23.145 --> 36:25.376
To remind me of what I almost lost.

36:27.295 --> 36:28.869
It's over, Clark.

36:30.290 --> 36:31.628
It really is.

36:32.943 --> 36:36.804
Look, I'm willing to give this friendship another shot
if you are.

36:44.602 --> 36:48.019
In the spirit of friendship,
I was wondering if you could help me with a problem.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.651
Absolutely.

36:50.032 --> 36:50.983
What is it?

36:51.030 --> 36:52.169
Well, it's a who.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.988
Lois lane.

37:00.373 --> 37:01.257
Clark,

37:01.798 --> 37:05.285
I don't know what to say, man. I mean, you saved
my life, and I practically tried to kill you.

37:05.308 --> 37:08.349
It’s not the best way
to get this coach-player relationship off the ground.

37:08.396 --> 37:09.289
It's okay.

37:09.324 --> 37:11.741
If you want to bring this to the school's attention,
I totally understand.

37:11.764 --> 37:13.584
No, coach,you weren't yourself.

37:13.701 --> 37:16.249
- I'm just glad it wore off.
- Yeah.

37:17.787 --> 37:19.607
You're gonna do great out there today.

37:19.819 --> 37:22.541
I think after all that’s happened,
the guys are finally behind you.

37:22.811 --> 37:23.950
Thanks.

37:26.134 --> 37:27.379
Hey, coach...

37:27.426 --> 37:28.985
when you were in my loft,

37:29.079 --> 37:31.416
you told me to stay away from your girl.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.447
Who were you talking about?

37:35.232 --> 37:36.383
Honestly...

37:37.058 --> 37:38.702
I have no idea.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.003
I mean, like you said, I guess I wasn't myself.

37:41.109 --> 37:42.541
Good luck today Clark.

37:43.340 --> 37:44.596
I'll see you out there.

37:50.917 --> 37:54.135
The crows are behind 31-28

37:54.170 --> 37:56.178
with 7 seconds remaining.

37:56.213 --> 37:59.282
Fourth down and 60 yards from the end zone.

38:04.848 --> 38:06.785
Nate, I need you to get open...

38:06.821 --> 38:07.993
in the end zone.

38:08.016 --> 38:09.378
You serious?

38:09.414 --> 38:11.891
- You throw that far?
- Can you run that fast?

38:11.915 --> 38:13.218
Hell, yeah.

38:14.462 --> 38:15.434
Let's do it!

38:15.458 --> 38:18.534
- All right, guys. Hail mary on one.
- Hey!

38:27.808 --> 38:30.168
42! 42!

38:30.203 --> 38:32.223
29! Hut!

39:02.170 --> 39:05.598
Unbelievable! The Crows win!

39:05.633 --> 39:07.758
The Crows win!

39:36.287 --> 39:37.826
Wow, so...

39:37.861 --> 39:41.548
60-yard pass to win the big game
at the last second.

39:41.595 --> 39:44.777
You're gonna be, like,some superhero around here.

39:44.824 --> 39:46.994
I just might have to doan article on you.

39:47.417 --> 39:49.448
Does that mean you're back at the "torch"?

39:50.058 --> 39:51.103
Yeah.

39:53.135 --> 39:56.550
Since I'm not very good at ignoring 500-pound elephants,
I...

39:56.571 --> 40:00.399
I'm really sorry that I made things
so ridiculously awkward between us.

40:00.434 --> 40:02.266
You know, I thought you made a great cheerleader.

40:02.278 --> 40:05.225
Yeah, let's never talk about that again, okay?

40:05.348 --> 40:06.369
Look, clark,

40:06.416 --> 40:09.126
as much as I'd like to blame
the pom-pom juice for this,

40:10.441 --> 40:12.883
I obviously still have those feelings

40:12.930 --> 40:14.574
in me somewhere.

40:18.585 --> 40:19.677
Chloe...

40:22.800 --> 40:24.843
I wish I felt the same way,

40:24.866 --> 40:26.402
but I don'T.

40:28.327 --> 40:30.147
At least not right now.

40:30.441 --> 40:31.580
Right.

40:31.635 --> 40:33.074
I know that.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.724
And I accept it.

40:34.889 --> 40:37.260
I just hope that we can keep our friendship.

40:37.530 --> 40:40.909
Except now you're gonna be,like, big man on campus.

40:41.543 --> 40:44.678
Well, I'm hoping my new editor will keep me in line.

40:45.806 --> 40:47.811
I'm gonna make time for the "torch. "

40:47.882 --> 40:48.880
Wow.

40:49.737 --> 40:51.933
A superhero and journalist.

40:52.438 --> 40:54.387
What are the odds?

41:02.471 --> 41:03.974
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.649
If you break her heart,

41:11.872 --> 41:13.939
I'll come back and I'll break your legs.

41:13.962 --> 41:15.723
What do you mean,"come back"?

41:16.158 --> 41:21.287
Apparently, the dean got a call from a very
prominent benefactor with the initials "L.L."

41:21.369 --> 41:25.126
They did the white manpower dance and shazam...
I'm officially a freshman.

41:25.161 --> 41:26.499
Wow, that's great.

41:27.446 --> 41:30.124
Oh, don't pretend you had nothing to do with it.

41:30.147 --> 41:32.848
Why would lex call out of the blue on my behalf?

41:32.941 --> 41:35.970
Look, the important thing is,
you got in and you're leaving.

41:38.612 --> 41:41.031
Because that's what you wanted, right?

41:41.066 --> 41:43.893
Yeah, yeah, don't get all broken up about it.

41:43.929 --> 41:47.345
You know, if I could describe my time here in one word,

41:47.862 --> 41:49.327
it would be "weird. "

41:50.255 --> 41:53.237
I look forward to the relative normalcy of the big city.

41:54.435 --> 41:55.809
But don't worry,

41:56.044 --> 41:57.345
I’ll visit.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.492
Is that a promise or a threat?

42:04.554 --> 42:05.740
See you around...

42:05.986 --> 42:07.513
"Smallville. "

42:21.338 --> 42:25.338
