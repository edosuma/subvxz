Announcer:
<i>Previously on "MasterChef"...</i>

00:05.010 --> 00:09.151
Welcome to
the 50th anniversary
of Caesars Palace.

00:09.151 --> 00:11.824
‐ <i>in a high‐stakes</i>
<i>team challenge...</i>
‐ Whoo!

00:11.824 --> 00:13.694
This is the biggest birthday
I've ever attended.

00:13.694 --> 00:15.832
Daniel:
<i>Make sure every one</i>
<i>of those looks perfect.</i>

00:15.832 --> 00:18.136
‐ <i>the blue team...</i>
‐ Whoa, that's a lot of sauce.

00:18.136 --> 00:20.474
‐ I see that.
‐ The presentation
of the fish

00:20.474 --> 00:22.278
was a bit of
a miss for me.

00:22.278 --> 00:24.683
‐ <i>lost it all...</i>
‐ Congratulations red team!

00:24.683 --> 00:26.386
( all cheering )

00:26.386 --> 00:27.789
‐ <i>sending Yachecia...</i>
‐ Good luck.

00:27.789 --> 00:29.225
‐ <i>and Newton...</i>
‐ Best wishes.

00:29.225 --> 00:31.396
‐ <i>into a head‐to‐head battle...</i>
‐ Whoo!

00:31.396 --> 00:33.668
This is it.

00:33.668 --> 00:35.572
‐ <i>...for survival.</i>
‐ One of you

00:35.572 --> 00:38.043
is not coming back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

00:39.145 --> 00:40.480
<i>Tonight,</i>

00:40.480 --> 00:42.652
<i>the winning home cook</i>
<i>from Vegas returns.</i>

00:42.652 --> 00:44.021
Please welcome back...

00:45.658 --> 00:48.731
<i>Will it be Yachecia</i>
<i>or Newton?</i>

00:48.731 --> 00:50.501
<i>And then...</i>

00:50.501 --> 00:52.939
‐ Crawfish.
‐ It's alive.

00:52.939 --> 00:56.012
These things are wild.
Getting bit is normal.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.584
‐ <i>it's a challenging...</i>
‐ You've gotta work
quick, guys.

00:58.584 --> 01:00.287
<i>Gordon Ramsay skills test.</i>

01:00.287 --> 01:01.957
Dino:
<i>How am I gonna cook this?</i>

01:01.957 --> 01:03.561
This is impossible!

01:03.561 --> 01:05.364
‐ Whoo!
‐ <i>And the top 11...</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:06.967
So gross.
( shudders )

01:06.967 --> 01:08.871
‐ <i>find themselves...</i>
‐ Aah!

01:08.871 --> 01:10.140
‐ <i>...in hot water.</i>
‐ Whew!

01:10.140 --> 01:11.577
‐ Yeowch.
‐ <i>Who will claw</i>

01:11.577 --> 01:13.146
<i>their way to victory?</i>

01:13.146 --> 01:15.217
‐ Yeah, buddy.
‐ <i>And who will end up</i>

01:15.217 --> 01:17.656
‐ ( squeals )
‐ <i>...shell‐shocked?</i>

01:17.656 --> 01:19.091
( shudders )

01:30.247 --> 01:31.784
Gordon: All of you,
come down to the front.

01:33.219 --> 01:34.723
Daniel:
<i>I'm in the top 11.</i>

01:34.723 --> 01:36.593
<i>Things are now</i>
<i>getting serious.</i>

01:36.593 --> 01:38.063
There's a lot
of strong cooks here.

01:38.063 --> 01:39.866
<i>This competition's</i>
<i>getting tougher,</i>

01:39.866 --> 01:41.537
<i>the judges are expecting</i>
<i>a lot more from us,</i>

01:41.537 --> 01:44.241
<i>and at least one of us</i>
<i>is going home tonight.</i>

01:44.241 --> 01:47.749
So you gotta bring it
every single day now.

01:47.749 --> 01:51.155
It's good to see
you all made it back
safely from Las Vegas.

01:51.155 --> 01:55.330
But not all of you returned
back to the MasterChef
kitchen with us.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.902
Newton and Yachecia
went head to head

01:57.902 --> 02:00.875
with an oyster dish
that was our toughest
challenge

02:00.875 --> 02:02.912
so far this competition.

02:02.912 --> 02:06.419
But just one of them
is about to walk back
into this kitchen.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.758
The other, sadly,
has been eliminated.

02:10.962 --> 02:12.397
Turn around, all of you.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.143
Please welcome back...

02:24.756 --> 02:29.633
‐ Yachecia.
‐ ( cheering )

02:29.633 --> 02:32.471
I'm thrilled
that Yachecia's back here
in the MasterChef kitchen...

02:32.471 --> 02:34.643
Thank you, Jesus!
I made it!

02:34.643 --> 02:36.345
<i>...but I'm also thinking,</i>
<i>"Uh‐oh.</i>

02:36.345 --> 02:38.416
I'm gonna have to go up
against her at some point."

02:38.416 --> 02:40.922
<i>She's one of</i>
<i>my toughest competitors.</i>

02:40.922 --> 02:42.759
<i>This could be trouble for me.</i>

02:42.759 --> 02:45.197
‐ Man, that was tight.
‐ That was.

02:45.197 --> 02:46.700
‐ Whew.
‐ Gordon: Yachecia,

02:46.700 --> 02:49.338
it came down
to the finest of details.

02:49.338 --> 02:51.777
Two gallant, bold efforts,

02:51.777 --> 02:54.683
but you had one more
element than Newton.

02:54.683 --> 02:56.553
Congratulations.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.824
You know, I've been
through a lot of tough
situations in my life,

02:58.824 --> 03:01.797
and so those things
propel me, they never
push me down.

03:01.797 --> 03:04.401
I rise up over it
and make it work for me,

03:04.401 --> 03:06.405
because there is
no quit in me.

03:06.405 --> 03:08.677
Guys, right now,

03:08.677 --> 03:12.150
we're looking
at the top 11 home cooks
in the entire country.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.290
One of you will win
a quarter of a million dollars,

03:15.290 --> 03:18.864
a guaranteed spot
on the next MasterChef cruise,

03:18.864 --> 03:20.935
and the MasterChef trophy.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.273
Now it's time to begin
your next challenge.

03:23.273 --> 03:25.511
That's right.
We're gonna challenge you

03:25.511 --> 03:29.853
‐ to master a very
important culinary skill.
‐ Nice.

03:29.853 --> 03:32.792
For this challenge,
you'll all be working with

03:32.792 --> 03:35.163
an incredible protein
that is revered

03:35.163 --> 03:37.802
and devoured
all over the world,

03:37.802 --> 03:40.307
and that's really popular
in my home city
of New Orleans.

03:44.883 --> 03:46.185
Crawfish.

03:47.522 --> 03:49.893
Crawfish! Mmm!

03:49.893 --> 03:52.230
‐ What?
‐ It's alive.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.437
‐ ( sighs heavily )
‐ Oh, my God.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.877
Crawfish.
Now these little guys

03:58.877 --> 04:01.115
are such
a treasured ingredient
in the culinary world.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.052
They're like
the lobster's little cousin,

04:03.052 --> 04:05.223
only a lot harder
to deal with.

04:06.325 --> 04:07.795
There's not much
meat on them.

04:07.795 --> 04:10.735
However, what meat there is
is absolutely delicious.

04:10.735 --> 04:13.841
Tonight, your challenge
will be to extract

04:13.841 --> 04:16.245
the meat from these
incredible crawfish.

04:16.245 --> 04:18.851
And the only way
it should be done

04:18.851 --> 04:20.554
is the MasterChef way.

04:20.554 --> 04:22.057
Let's go.

04:23.727 --> 04:26.432
So first things first,
salted water.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.670
Lightly season that water.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.440
Now these things are wild.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.680
Getting bit
two or three times
is normal.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.085
Water up to a boil, in.

04:36.085 --> 04:38.757
One, two, three,
and then finish

04:38.757 --> 04:41.362
with the rest
of them in there.
Lid back on.

04:41.362 --> 04:43.266
Now that's the humane way
to kill them,

04:43.266 --> 04:44.803
straight into
boiling water.

04:44.803 --> 04:46.740
The secret here
is the quicker
you cook them,

04:46.740 --> 04:49.746
the easier they are
to get out of that shell.

04:49.746 --> 04:52.084
15 seconds.

04:52.084 --> 04:56.660
Now, out. In.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.730
Overcook them,
and they turn to mush.

04:58.730 --> 05:02.104
Now, claws, the body,
turn and twist.

05:02.104 --> 05:04.007
It's really important
you put your thumb underneath

05:04.007 --> 05:06.045
and twist,

05:06.045 --> 05:07.882
and then open up the tail,

05:07.882 --> 05:10.386
lightly crack that shell,
and then peel.

05:10.386 --> 05:13.459
These tails should come out
in perfect order.

05:13.459 --> 05:15.865
Be careful
not to rip that meat.

05:15.865 --> 05:19.037
Once you've got
the first part of the tail
peeled off,

05:19.037 --> 05:21.408
you then very carefully

05:21.408 --> 05:24.749
use your thumb here
and push that tail,

05:24.749 --> 05:26.218
push, push, push,

05:26.218 --> 05:28.557
and pull very,
very carefully.

05:28.557 --> 05:30.226
And there we have
one beautiful tail.

05:30.226 --> 05:32.899
‐ Oh, my.
‐ Place that on.

05:32.899 --> 05:36.071
Second one. Do not twist
halfway down the shell.

05:36.071 --> 05:40.180
You'll rip the tail.
Twist back into the body
and pull back out.

05:40.180 --> 05:43.152
That way you get to get
that nerve out at the same
time as well,

05:43.152 --> 05:46.125
so you clean the crawfish
at the same time.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.162
Open up, and then twist.

05:48.162 --> 05:50.768
Jenny:
<i>Watching Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>take apart those crawfish,</i>

05:50.768 --> 05:51.870
<i>it's amazing.</i>

05:51.870 --> 05:53.372
He does it
with so much finesse,

05:53.372 --> 05:55.109
makes it look so easy.

05:55.109 --> 05:56.780
<i>but I know</i>
<i>in the back of my head,</i>

05:56.780 --> 05:58.349
<i>I'm like, "This is</i>
<i>going to be so hard."</i>

05:58.349 --> 06:01.388
I'm gonna have to really absorb
everything that he shows me.

06:01.388 --> 06:04.394
Finally,
pull and pop it out.

06:04.394 --> 06:07.334
And look,
that's how you remove
the crawfish tails

06:07.334 --> 06:09.238
like a true MasterChef.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.741
Now, if you work
smartly tonight,

06:10.741 --> 06:13.747
you should end up
with something like this.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.487
‐ Ohh.
‐ Ooh, baby.

06:17.487 --> 06:19.258
Now it's all of your turn.

06:19.258 --> 06:21.428
Please, all of you
head to your stations.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.934
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ ( sighs )

06:23.934 --> 06:25.638
I've never extracted
meat from a crawfish,

06:25.638 --> 06:27.474
<i>but I'm gonna try</i>
<i>to do my best.</i>

06:27.474 --> 06:29.779
<i>Let's just see how it goes,</i>
<i>'cause right now,</i>

06:29.779 --> 06:32.117
I'm scared.
( whimpers )

06:32.117 --> 06:35.624
<i>These things got</i>
<i>little claws like lobsters.</i>

06:35.624 --> 06:36.826
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to kill this thing.</i>

06:36.826 --> 06:38.129
<i>Ew, it look nasty.</i>

06:38.129 --> 06:39.732
( shudders )

06:39.732 --> 06:41.536
All right,
now at your stations,

06:41.536 --> 06:44.909
each of you has your own bag
of gorgeous, fresh crawfish.

06:44.909 --> 06:46.646
We're also looking to see

06:46.646 --> 06:48.583
who can get
the most crawfish done

06:48.583 --> 06:50.854
in just 20 minutes.

06:50.854 --> 06:52.825
Aarón:
The five home cooks

06:52.825 --> 06:56.165
that yield the most
perfect crawfish tails
will be safe.

06:56.165 --> 06:59.237
The six weakest
will immediately face

06:59.237 --> 07:00.641
an elimination challenge

07:00.641 --> 07:04.214
where at least one home cook
will be sent home.

07:04.214 --> 07:06.886
‐ Is everyone ready?
‐ Yes, Chef.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.191
Your 20 minutes...

07:09.191 --> 07:11.061
starts...

07:11.061 --> 07:13.199
now.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.736
‐ Let's go.
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.

07:14.736 --> 07:16.506
‐ Come on.
‐ Whoa, baby.

07:16.506 --> 07:17.575
Ooh!

07:21.750 --> 07:23.386
Oh, God!

07:26.225 --> 07:28.563
I have eaten
quite a bit of crawfish.

07:28.563 --> 07:30.333
It's a little bit more delicate,
but not very different

07:30.333 --> 07:32.505
from the same technique
I use for lobster,

07:32.505 --> 07:34.509
which I definitely eat a lot of
back home in Boston.

07:34.509 --> 07:36.513
So I feel this definitely
plays to my strengths,

07:36.513 --> 07:38.282
and feel pretty good
that I'm gonna be up
on that balcony

07:38.282 --> 07:40.052
before this is all over.

07:40.052 --> 07:42.357
Speed up.
You've got to move
those fingers.

07:42.357 --> 07:44.361
My son and I love crawfish,
and so

07:44.361 --> 07:46.365
it's kind of a Saturday night
treat for the both of us,

07:46.365 --> 07:49.371
so I'm not extremely
intimidated by it.

07:49.371 --> 07:51.543
I need to be in the top 10.
I need to be in that balcony.

07:51.543 --> 07:53.078
I've been in enough
pressure tests.

07:53.078 --> 07:54.448
I don't want to have
to cook today.

07:56.151 --> 07:57.555
( sighs )

07:57.555 --> 07:58.757
The top 10 is just around
the corner,

07:58.757 --> 08:00.426
so I want to see
a little bit of speed.

08:00.426 --> 08:02.263
‐ Come on, come on, come on.
‐ More importantly,

08:02.263 --> 08:04.902
the quality, Christina,
taking that meat from
that shell.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.438
‐ Perfect.
‐ Here's the thing, guys.

08:06.438 --> 08:08.877
If I was in their shoes,
I'd go for the biggest
ones first.

08:08.877 --> 08:10.246
They're so much easier
to get out of the shell.

08:10.246 --> 08:13.052
Those tiny ones
that disintegrate

08:13.052 --> 08:14.589
the minute you burst
them open‐‐ move on.

08:14.589 --> 08:15.791
‐ Yep.
‐ Go for the big ones.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.393
‐ Yep.
‐ It's almost like

08:17.393 --> 08:18.930
the ones that look
like little baby lobsters.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.567
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yep, absolutely.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.705
‐ ( sighs )
‐ Come on!

08:22.705 --> 08:25.544
Five minutes gone, guys.
15 minutes to go.

08:25.544 --> 08:27.648
‐ There we go.
‐ Right, Cate, how you doing?

08:27.648 --> 08:28.984
Hi, Chef, I'm great.

08:28.984 --> 08:30.386
Crawfish.
Have you worked
with these before?

08:30.386 --> 08:33.158
I'm very familiar with
definitely ordering them
on the menu,

08:33.158 --> 08:36.064
but peeling them and working
with them, not so much.

08:36.064 --> 08:37.233
Right. Are you going
into the top 10?

08:37.233 --> 08:39.237
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ We'll find out. Good luck.

08:39.237 --> 08:41.576
‐ Yes, thank you.
‐ Nice.

08:41.576 --> 08:43.847
‐ Young lad, how we doing?
‐ I feel like I'm doing
pretty good.

08:43.847 --> 08:46.519
I've killed my fair share
of crustaceans

08:46.519 --> 08:48.422
since I came here
to the MasterChef kitchen,

08:48.422 --> 08:50.326
so I know how they work.
I know how they come apart.

08:50.326 --> 08:52.598
You know,
I'm the shrimp slayer.
The crab killer.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.769
We're gonna be
the crustacean crusher now.

08:54.769 --> 08:55.971
All right.
Good luck, all right?

08:55.971 --> 08:57.173
Thank you so much, Chef.

08:57.173 --> 08:59.177
‐ Jason.
‐ Chef Tosi.

08:59.177 --> 09:00.781
Jason, you ever worked
with crawfish before?

09:00.781 --> 09:03.052
I come from New England.
We have beautiful seafood,

09:03.052 --> 09:04.722
but we do not have
crawfish like this.

09:04.722 --> 09:06.826
I've only had them
in like a buffet, cold,

09:06.826 --> 09:09.230
so I mean, it's just a dream to
work with something like this.

09:09.230 --> 09:11.970
I want to do it justice
and make sure that
they are done properly.

09:11.970 --> 09:14.140
All right, now you gotta
have quick fingers,

09:14.140 --> 09:16.278
and make sure you're putting
your best work forward,

09:16.278 --> 09:18.415
‐ because that's what you're
gonna be judged on tonight.
‐ Absolutely, Chef.

09:18.415 --> 09:20.152
‐ Keep at it.
‐ Thank you.

09:20.152 --> 09:23.359
‐ 10 minutes remaining.
‐ Aah!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.770
‐ Right, young man.
How you doing?
‐ Doing well.

09:28.770 --> 09:29.939
Crawfish,
cooked them before?

09:29.939 --> 09:31.776
I've never
cooked them before,
but I love 'em.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.112
I love eating crawfish.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.280
Top 10, come on,
where we going?

09:34.280 --> 09:35.449
I'm trying to go
all the way to the end.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.387
I want to be
America's next MasterChef.

09:37.387 --> 09:38.489
It means everything
to my family,

09:38.489 --> 09:40.560
and I'm going as hard
as I can for this,

09:40.560 --> 09:42.798
with the intent to
continue to go farther.

09:42.798 --> 09:44.300
Good luck.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.971
Yeowch. Hot.

09:45.971 --> 09:47.140
Jenny, how we doing?

09:47.140 --> 09:48.342
It's hot,
it's hot, it's hot.

09:48.342 --> 09:50.046
I'm just trying to keep
the shells together.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.181
Have you had
crawfish before?

09:51.181 --> 09:52.818
No, I've never had
crawfish before.

09:52.818 --> 09:54.320
Is this gonna send you home
or you going to the balcony?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.926
No, it's not!
I'm so stoked.
I'm so happy to be here.

09:56.926 --> 09:59.030
And I just want to learn
more and more and more
and more.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.099
So I'm not going home today.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.536
‐ All right, good luck.
‐ Thank you.

10:05.009 --> 10:07.881
What is happening to Eboni?
She seems very intimidated.

10:07.881 --> 10:09.852
Jason:
Eboni, you can do it.
Just keep going.

10:09.852 --> 10:12.356
Eboni is struggling
with this crawfish,

10:12.356 --> 10:15.463
<i>and she is paralyzed</i>
<i>at her station.</i>

10:15.463 --> 10:17.033
She'd better
get it together or else

10:17.033 --> 10:19.370
<i>she could be the one</i>
<i>going home today.</i>

10:19.370 --> 10:21.809
I didn't want to kill it.
They so gross.

10:21.809 --> 10:24.915
<i>But I put 'em in a pot,</i>
<i>and now I just can't</i>

10:24.915 --> 10:27.153
seem to get past
the critter

10:27.153 --> 10:29.625
<i>to even try</i>
<i>to get the meat out.</i>

10:29.625 --> 10:32.096
‐ <i>I can't even stop shaking.</i>
‐ ( bleep )

10:32.096 --> 10:34.300
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:35.771
( bleep )

10:40.580 --> 10:42.851
( shudders )

10:42.851 --> 10:45.624
‐ Eboni is struggling.
‐ ( bleep )

10:45.624 --> 10:47.928
Jenny:
Eboni, stay in the game.

10:47.928 --> 10:49.598
Eboni's getting all frazzled.

10:49.598 --> 10:52.436
( exhales )
Oh, my God.

10:52.436 --> 10:53.840
She needs to get this
back together,

10:53.840 --> 10:56.946
or else she could for sure
be in that pressure test.

10:56.946 --> 10:57.948
( bleep )

10:59.484 --> 11:00.854
‐ Eboni.
‐ Huh?

11:00.854 --> 11:02.958
You seem like you're
hyperventilating.
What's going on?

11:02.958 --> 11:04.494
I feel real
sick to my stomach.

11:04.494 --> 11:05.797
I'm having a hard time
doing this.

11:05.797 --> 11:07.466
‐ You're my tough gal.
‐ I know.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.839
You can't let them see
this in you, right?

11:09.839 --> 11:11.408
‐ You want to be
in the top 10?
‐ I do.

11:11.408 --> 11:13.145
I got four kids
who depend on me.

11:13.145 --> 11:14.314
I can't let this
send me home.

11:14.314 --> 11:15.482
I'm too strong for that.

11:15.482 --> 11:17.855
Deep breaths, keep it in,
and keep going.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.959
Keep your eye on this, okay?
Don't even think about it.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.596
Just let your fingers
do the work. Good luck.

11:21.596 --> 11:25.102
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Five minutes remaining.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.137
Come on.

11:26.137 --> 11:27.941
All of you speed up!

11:27.941 --> 11:30.346
Christina: Now, guys,
who do you think's gonna
really succeed?

11:30.346 --> 11:32.450
Daniel doing a great job.
Strong, confident.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.620
There you go.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.055
Gordon:
And so's Cate.

11:35.055 --> 11:36.458
They are nailing this thing.
Two very good students there.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.732
Jason is off
to an incredible start.

11:39.732 --> 11:40.901
He is so in the zone.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.136
I'm really worried
about Jenny.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.173
‐ Argh!
‐ Gordon: I don't know

11:44.173 --> 11:46.812
if this level of finesse
is in Jenny's wheelhouse.

11:46.812 --> 11:48.983
I have to say,
I'm a little worried
about Dino.

11:48.983 --> 11:51.321
He is not confident.

11:51.321 --> 11:53.860
( sighs )
Oh, no, no, that's not it.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.563
60 seconds remaining,

11:55.563 --> 11:59.437
and only five of you
will go straight through

11:59.437 --> 12:01.876
to the top 10 of this
incredible competition.

12:01.876 --> 12:03.947
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Gordon: Just peel.

12:03.947 --> 12:05.650
Peel, peel, peel.
Let's go.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.654
Come on, guys. Speed up.

12:07.654 --> 12:09.290
Aarón: Make sure they're
beautifully presented.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.727
‐ Let's go.
‐ Gordon: Come on.

12:10.727 --> 12:11.963
‐ Christina: Push, guys.
‐ Here we go.

12:11.963 --> 12:13.700
Gordon: Ten.
Judges: Nine.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.404
Eight, seven, six,

12:16.404 --> 12:18.576
Five, four, three,

12:18.576 --> 12:21.147
two, one.

12:21.147 --> 12:23.051
‐ Stop, stop, well done!
‐ Hands in the air!

12:23.051 --> 12:24.053
Hands in the air.

12:24.053 --> 12:27.426
‐ Oh!
‐ ( applause )

12:27.426 --> 12:30.700
Now it's time to find out
which five of you will be safe,

12:30.700 --> 12:33.606
and who will
have to undertake
another challenge.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.052
I'm more nervous
for this challenge

12:40.052 --> 12:41.856
than I've been
for any other challenge,

12:41.856 --> 12:43.960
<i>because top 10</i>
<i>is on the line.</i>

12:43.960 --> 12:46.264
All right, Adam,
do you think you've
done enough here?

12:46.264 --> 12:47.266
I do think
that I did enough.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.905
I got the intestines
out of each of them.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.041
I think I did a great job.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.744
<i>My crawfish</i>
<i>look really nice,</i>

12:52.744 --> 12:56.051
<i>but I have no idea</i>
<i>what the judges are gonna say.</i>

12:56.051 --> 12:57.587
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

12:57.587 --> 13:01.061
And so I'm just sweating,
waiting for the judges'
decision.

13:02.063 --> 13:03.331
Jason, how do you
think you did?

13:03.331 --> 13:06.672
I think I got a pretty good
amount of crawfish tails.

13:06.672 --> 13:08.843
<i>I've shelled</i>
<i>a whole ton of crawfish,</i>

13:08.843 --> 13:10.547
but have I done enough?

13:10.547 --> 13:12.751
Have I done to the level
and the perfection

13:12.751 --> 13:14.788
that I need to be safe
for this challenge?

13:14.788 --> 13:16.224
Thank you, Chefs.

13:17.226 --> 13:18.228
I don't know.

13:18.228 --> 13:19.363
All right, Jeff.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.369
My nerves are going.
My heart is racing.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.975
Looks like that's
still got a leg on.

13:24.975 --> 13:28.281
I was trying to get
this last batch onto it.

13:28.281 --> 13:30.119
‐ All right.
‐ This challenge

13:30.119 --> 13:33.125
is the first challenge
that we've ever had
in the MasterChef kitchen

13:33.125 --> 13:35.229
<i>where it feels like there's</i>
<i>a microscope next to you</i>

13:35.229 --> 13:36.632
and they're gonna
be analyzing it

13:36.632 --> 13:39.170
<i>way underneath</i>
<i>in their petri dish.</i>

13:39.170 --> 13:41.474
So, Eboni,

13:41.474 --> 13:43.646
it looks a little rough.

13:43.646 --> 13:45.282
‐ Where's the other half?
‐ It's a little mangled.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.921
‐ Tiny.
‐ I mean, it's just incredible

13:47.921 --> 13:48.956
<i>the scrutiny</i>
<i>that's going into this</i>

13:48.956 --> 13:50.927
<i>to make the best decision</i>

13:50.927 --> 13:52.864
of who's gonna go up
onto that balcony

13:52.864 --> 13:54.935
<i>and who's worthy of being</i>
<i>a part of the top 10.</i>

13:54.935 --> 13:57.206
‐ Jenny, you done this before?
‐ No, never, Chef.

13:57.206 --> 13:58.609
I wasn't able
to fully execute

13:58.609 --> 13:59.845
getting those things
out of the shell.

13:59.845 --> 14:02.249
<i>However, I feel</i>
<i>like I got a decent amount</i>

14:02.249 --> 14:04.555
<i>that look good,</i>
<i>but I'm going up against</i>

14:04.555 --> 14:07.226
the top 11 home cooks
in America.

14:07.226 --> 14:08.796
Did you put any back in
to the water?

14:08.796 --> 14:11.401
A couple, Chef.
They were sticking,
so I put 'em back in,

14:11.401 --> 14:12.604
and got 'em
right back out.

14:12.604 --> 14:14.273
And there's
not gonna be a big gap

14:14.273 --> 14:16.645
<i>between the best and the worst</i>
<i>in this dish, either.</i>

14:16.645 --> 14:18.916
There's a very small
margin of error.

14:20.185 --> 14:21.689
All right, thank you.

14:21.689 --> 14:24.327
I am very confident in myself
based on what I have displayed,

14:24.327 --> 14:26.665
<i>but not sure exactly how</i>
<i>the judges feel about it.</i>

14:26.665 --> 14:29.370
I could be walking up
on the balcony, home free...

14:29.370 --> 14:31.508
‐ Tough, tough job.
‐ <i>...automatically</i>
<i>in the top 10,</i>

14:31.508 --> 14:34.781
or could be down here
swimming with the crawfishes.

14:37.052 --> 14:38.623
Would everyone please
come down to the front?

14:44.233 --> 14:46.004
Now you're about
to find out

14:46.004 --> 14:48.709
which five of you
are going straight
to the top 10.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.680
( sighs )

14:50.680 --> 14:52.149
Step forward...

14:56.057 --> 14:57.326
Yachecia.

14:58.729 --> 15:02.604
Have you done enough
to get yourself in
to the top 10?

15:02.604 --> 15:03.939
I believe so, Chef.

15:03.939 --> 15:06.144
‐ So do we. Congratulations.
‐ Oh, thank you, Jesus!

15:06.144 --> 15:07.847
‐ Top 10.
‐ ( applause )

15:07.847 --> 15:09.518
‐ Get it, girl.
‐ Great job.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.356
Gabriel.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.732
Do you think your performance
across the last 20 minutes

15:16.732 --> 15:20.540
warrants a space
in the top 10
of this competition?

15:20.540 --> 15:22.409
If I'm being honest,
Chef, no.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.652
You're right.
Step back.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.656
You will cook.

15:30.225 --> 15:31.227
Adam.

15:33.431 --> 15:35.102
Based on your performance,

15:35.102 --> 15:37.907
do you feel that you
have earned a spot
to stand next to Yachecia?

15:37.907 --> 15:40.011
Yes, Chef.
I worked my butt off

15:40.011 --> 15:41.582
to get as many
through as I could,

15:41.582 --> 15:44.120
and I made sure
that each of them
were deveined.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.455
Tonight...

15:48.061 --> 15:50.265
you did not do enough.
Please step back.

15:50.265 --> 15:52.704
You will be cooking.

15:55.142 --> 15:56.144
Jenny.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.655
Do you think
you belong in the top 10?

16:01.655 --> 16:03.358
I do, Chef.
I think during the 20 minutes,

16:03.358 --> 16:06.364
I really tried hard to emulate
what Chef Ramsay did before us.

16:06.364 --> 16:08.067
I threw away things
that weren't good

16:08.067 --> 16:11.708
and didn't put it on the thing
if I didn't think it was
up to standard.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.011
The news is...

16:15.516 --> 16:17.687
you did...

16:17.687 --> 16:19.925
not do enough.

16:19.925 --> 16:22.530
Please step back.
You will be cooking.

16:22.530 --> 16:23.599
Yes, Chef.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.605
Eboni.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.445
Your performance
across the last
20 minutes,

16:30.445 --> 16:33.819
does it warrant
a spot in the top 10?

16:33.819 --> 16:36.224
I mean, honestly,
I would say yes,

16:36.224 --> 16:39.396
because I did overcome
my fear of cooking them,

16:39.396 --> 16:41.568
and I put 19 on the plate.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.672
Out of the 19,
I think one was bad.

16:43.672 --> 16:46.077
So, with that effort
I would say yes.

16:48.248 --> 16:50.820
You are wrong.
Step back.

16:52.456 --> 16:53.792
Jason.

16:56.264 --> 16:57.800
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.538
Top 10.

16:59.538 --> 17:01.642
I'm in the top 10.
This is crazy!

17:01.642 --> 17:05.583
<i>Getting to this position</i>
<i>in the competition right now</i>
<i>is just amazing.</i>

17:05.583 --> 17:07.720
Caitlin.
You didn't do enough.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.789
You will be cooking.

17:08.789 --> 17:10.125
But as we move
towards the top 10...

17:10.125 --> 17:13.431
Daniel,
you made the top 10.

17:13.431 --> 17:16.070
<i>...other competitors</i>
<i>are starting to rise</i>

17:16.070 --> 17:18.007
in the MasterChef competition.

17:18.007 --> 17:21.247
Cate, you won't
be staying down here.

17:21.247 --> 17:22.750
You're going up.
Congratulations.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.955
So trying my best
to just stay focused

17:24.955 --> 17:26.190
<i>and keep my eye on the prize</i>

17:26.190 --> 17:29.096
<i>because I need to go</i>
<i>straight to the top.</i>

17:29.096 --> 17:32.336
Jeff, Dino,
one of you is in the top 10,

17:32.336 --> 17:35.041
and one of you
is going straight into

17:35.041 --> 17:37.012
a dreaded pressure test.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.882
Jeff, out of 10,

17:38.882 --> 17:40.686
how would you mark
your performance?

17:40.686 --> 17:42.289
I'd give it a nine.

17:42.289 --> 17:44.728
Dino, how would you
grade your performance?

17:44.728 --> 17:46.698
I would grade it a 10.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.169
Dino's crawfish
is just as good as mine,

17:49.169 --> 17:52.209
but I got a lot more
accomplished in that 20 minutes.

17:52.209 --> 17:55.482
And I feel confident that this
will get me up to the top 10.

17:55.482 --> 17:56.818
Congratulations.

18:04.868 --> 18:08.107
Jeff, Dino, one of you
is in the top 10,

18:08.107 --> 18:13.652
and one of you is going straight
into a dreaded pressure test.

18:13.652 --> 18:14.654
Congratulations.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.804
Dino. Top 10.

18:22.804 --> 18:25.041
‐ Come on, Dino!
‐ ( applause )

18:25.041 --> 18:27.412
Baby, top 10!
Oh, yeah.

18:27.412 --> 18:31.988
<i>I'm one step</i>
<i>closer to that trophy</i>
<i>and the MasterChef title...</i>

18:31.988 --> 18:34.661
‐ Amazing.
‐ <i>and I want to show everyone</i>
<i>that I'm up against</i>

18:34.661 --> 18:36.665
why I'm really here
and why I deserve to win.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.938
Now as for the rest of you,

18:39.938 --> 18:43.579
your elimination challenge
starts right now.

18:43.579 --> 18:45.950
In this next challenge,
you'll have to take
the crawfish meat

18:45.950 --> 18:47.285
that you've just extracted

18:47.285 --> 18:51.528
and turn it into
a MasterChef‐worthy dish.

18:51.528 --> 18:55.435
A dish created by me.

19:02.382 --> 19:04.486
Tonight,
you'll be making...

19:06.658 --> 19:10.064
an incredible
crawfish dumpling

19:10.064 --> 19:13.171
served over a fragrant
lemongrass broth

19:13.171 --> 19:16.110
and garnished
with microchives
and chili threads.

19:16.110 --> 19:19.684
Understand this,
you won't be left entirely
to your own devices,

19:19.684 --> 19:22.790
because I'm gonna show
you all how it's done.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.461
Watch carefully, please.

19:25.461 --> 19:28.267
First, you get set up
before we start making
the dumplings, okay?

19:28.267 --> 19:30.639
Combine your crawfish tail
with the garlic, the ginger,

19:30.639 --> 19:32.910
the shallots, yuzu,
freshly‐squeezed,
grated inside,

19:32.910 --> 19:34.814
and you sort of
bring it together.

19:34.814 --> 19:36.885
Now, dumpling wrapper.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.657
Make sure you get these things
really nice and thin.

19:39.657 --> 19:41.895
Take a dowel
and just roll out
the ends.

19:41.895 --> 19:43.231
That way when we
come to crimp them

19:43.231 --> 19:45.903
they're nice and thin,
and not too thick.

19:45.903 --> 19:48.274
Now teaspoon of
those incredible crawfish,

19:48.274 --> 19:50.746
and then place the filling
into the center.

19:50.746 --> 19:51.982
Put too much in, of course,

19:51.982 --> 19:53.084
and you're gonna burst it.

19:53.084 --> 19:55.923
Now, egg wash around
the top half.

19:55.923 --> 19:58.327
You're sealing it,
almost like the glue.

19:58.327 --> 20:01.033
From there, push all
the ingredients down.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.106
Push it over, lift it up
into your hands,

20:04.106 --> 20:06.377
and then left to right,
right to left,

20:06.377 --> 20:07.847
and you push out that air.

20:07.847 --> 20:10.351
Once you've got your
half‐crescent shapes,
like that,

20:10.351 --> 20:14.359
very carefully start to crimp,
and just fold over.

20:14.359 --> 20:17.132
Push, pull, push, pull.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.902
Leave the ends open,

20:18.902 --> 20:22.309
and then from there,
take a touch of the egg wash

20:22.309 --> 20:25.315
and you just
knit them together, okay?

20:25.315 --> 20:26.851
Dumpling one.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.489
<i>Being up on that balcony's</i>
<i>one of the best places to see</i>

20:29.489 --> 20:31.060
one of the best chefs
in the world.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.997
You've gotta
work quick, guys, okay?

20:32.997 --> 20:35.502
Daniel:
<i>This is something people would</i>
<i>pay thousands of dollars for</i>

20:35.502 --> 20:36.671
<i>and I get it for free,</i>

20:36.671 --> 20:37.673
<i>and that definitely</i>
<i>lets you know</i>

20:37.673 --> 20:39.677
what kind
of opportunity you have,

20:39.677 --> 20:42.248
<i>and I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let that opportunity</i>
<i>slip out of my hands.</i>

20:42.248 --> 20:44.252
Look. Beautiful little
money bags.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.390
Now, get the steamer.

20:46.390 --> 20:49.363
Always want to
put some lemongrass in there
so it's aromatic.

20:49.363 --> 20:51.266
Get your basket.

20:51.266 --> 20:53.204
This is where
you steam them, lightly.

20:53.204 --> 20:57.546
Onto the cabbage, and then
steam for three minutes.

20:57.546 --> 20:59.951
While that's doing,
get the broth seasoned
beautifully.

20:59.951 --> 21:02.990
The base is vegetable stock,
lemongrass, chili oil,

21:02.990 --> 21:04.894
fennel seeds and
a touch of fish sauce,

21:04.894 --> 21:07.566
and finished
with fresh grated yuzu.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.773
Caramelize those vegetables.
Roast off those
incredible shells,

21:10.773 --> 21:13.010
and then deglaze
with that sake.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.281
Now, once
they've cooked, look.

21:15.281 --> 21:17.085
Beautifully steamed.

21:17.085 --> 21:21.193
From there, gently
lift up your dumplings.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.565
The round of the dumpling
goes to the round of the plate

21:23.565 --> 21:25.869
so they look like
they've been put into the bowl
with a bit of finesse.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.640
Take your presentation tails

21:27.640 --> 21:31.714
and put that in between
the beautiful dumplings.

21:31.714 --> 21:34.787
And then your delicious,
fragrant broth,

21:34.787 --> 21:39.997
and then fresh yuzu.
Touch of garnish, center.

21:39.997 --> 21:42.102
And then, very carefully,
you finish this

21:42.102 --> 21:44.740
with little drops
of your chili oil,

21:44.740 --> 21:48.748
and there you have
a beautiful crawfish dumpling.

21:48.748 --> 21:51.754
Beautiful.

21:51.754 --> 21:54.025
Everyone please
head back to your stations.

21:55.194 --> 21:57.198
I screwed up earlier
with the crawfish.

21:57.198 --> 21:59.704
<i>Going into this challenge,</i>
<i>I'd better bring my A‐game</i>

21:59.704 --> 22:03.244
<i>because if I do not</i>
<i>execute this dish,</i>

22:03.244 --> 22:07.152
my MasterChef dream is gone.

22:07.152 --> 22:09.122
All right,
in front of you
at your stations

22:09.122 --> 22:12.495
you have everything
you need to make
that crawfish dumpling dish.

22:12.495 --> 22:16.136
You'll have 45 minutes to make
your flawless replication

22:16.136 --> 22:17.606
of Gordon's
crawfish dumplings.

22:17.606 --> 22:20.746
Remember, you six,
elimination is on the line.

22:20.746 --> 22:22.448
For one of you,
this is the last time

22:22.448 --> 22:24.754
you'll ever cook
in the MasterChef kitchen.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.958
‐ Gordon: Now,
are you all ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

22:26.958 --> 22:28.962
Your 45 minutes...

22:28.962 --> 22:30.599
starts...

22:32.803 --> 22:34.105
now.

22:34.105 --> 22:35.876
Come on, let's go.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.111
Yeah, buddy.

22:41.119 --> 22:43.157
As a dancer,
I'm used to the pressure.

22:43.157 --> 22:45.696
I think my problem so far
in this competition has been

22:45.696 --> 22:47.866
I don't apply the pressure
to myself early enough.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.302
Had I felt this same pressure

22:49.302 --> 22:51.039
just when I was
shelling the crawfish,

22:51.039 --> 22:52.843
you know, I would have more
to work with right now,

22:52.843 --> 22:54.647
and maybe be
up on the balcony,

22:54.647 --> 22:57.686
but it is what it is.
I'm just gonna make the most
of my time down here.

23:04.667 --> 23:07.338
Here we go, guys.
This is the most
important stage

23:07.338 --> 23:08.474
of the competition so far.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.446
To get yourself
into the top 10,

23:11.446 --> 23:14.119
they've gotta take
what they've just extracted
from those crawfish,

23:14.119 --> 23:15.989
elevate them
into a stunning dish.

23:15.989 --> 23:19.462
Now, biggest points of
jeopardy in those crawfish
dumplings, that broth.

23:19.462 --> 23:22.636
A good broth at home
would take two and a half
to three hours to make.

23:22.636 --> 23:24.306
Tonight, they've gotta
do it in 45 minutes.

23:24.306 --> 23:25.809
So the first thing,
nail the broth.

23:25.809 --> 23:27.846
Caramelize the vegetables,
but more importantly,

23:27.846 --> 23:30.519
overwork this broth,
and you're gonna
ruin the flavor.

23:30.519 --> 23:34.259
Secondly, if those dumplings
steam and burst open,
it's game over.

23:34.259 --> 23:36.531
For me, it's about being
a technician of flavor.

23:36.531 --> 23:38.835
I want to know
that you know how to use them,
you know how to season them.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.607
Show me that you know
what great crawfish
should taste like.

23:44.580 --> 23:47.786
Gordon: Just under
30 minutes to go.

23:47.786 --> 23:48.788
Come on, guys, please.

23:48.788 --> 23:50.024
Jason: Jenny,
eye of the tiger.

23:50.024 --> 23:51.694
You know it.

23:51.694 --> 23:53.698
‐ Right, Jenny.
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:53.698 --> 23:54.867
Have you ever made
dumplings at home?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.269
No, I've never made
dumplings before,

23:56.269 --> 23:58.808
but I love eating dumplings,
so I'm very excited

23:58.808 --> 24:00.311
to try this for
the first time on my own.

24:00.311 --> 24:02.014
Top 10, is it
in your wheelhouse?

24:02.014 --> 24:03.818
Top 10 is definitely
in my wheelhouse.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.022
I know it can do this,
I know I can execute this dish,

24:06.022 --> 24:08.828
and I'm ready to show
that I can come back
and do a really good job.

24:08.828 --> 24:10.599
‐ Come on, you can do this.
‐ I can do this.

24:10.599 --> 24:11.734
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

24:12.770 --> 24:14.406
‐ All right, Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

24:14.406 --> 24:15.675
How familiar
are you with crawfish?

24:15.675 --> 24:17.011
How familiar are you
with dumplings?

24:17.011 --> 24:18.347
I'm not very familiar
with crawfish at all.

24:18.347 --> 24:19.784
It's not something
that I eat in my home.

24:19.784 --> 24:21.386
‐ If we do anything,
we do crab.
‐ Okay.

24:21.386 --> 24:23.925
And the dumplings
I have not really made
before, either.

24:23.925 --> 24:25.762
Okay, so you're a little
out of your comfort zone.

24:25.762 --> 24:27.198
‐ You're a little
out of your element.
‐ Yes, Chef.

24:27.198 --> 24:28.233
But you've gotta
get in there,

24:28.233 --> 24:29.302
because if you want
to be up there,

24:29.302 --> 24:30.605
and you want to be
in the top 10,

24:30.605 --> 24:31.774
you're gonna have
to nail this tonight.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.210
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Keep tasting,

24:33.210 --> 24:34.713
and focus
on those dumplings.

24:34.713 --> 24:35.949
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ I don't want to
see you go home.

24:35.949 --> 24:37.719
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Gordon: Let's go.

24:37.719 --> 24:39.924
Just over 20 minutes
remaining.

24:39.924 --> 24:41.460
Get that broth on.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.163
Deglaze with sake,
flambé.

24:43.163 --> 24:45.602
‐ Get going, guys.
‐ Yeah, buddy.

24:45.602 --> 24:46.938
Looking great, Adam.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.352
It won't catch.

24:57.526 --> 24:58.528
Whoo!

25:00.431 --> 25:02.268
See, how did hers catch?

25:02.268 --> 25:04.472
Oh, my God.
Really, today?

25:04.472 --> 25:06.711
It doesn't have to catch.
It just needs to cook down.

25:06.711 --> 25:09.115
‐ It doesn't have to flambé.
‐ That's not gonna work!

25:09.115 --> 25:11.654
Daniel: <i>Eboni just looks</i>
<i>a little frazzled right now.</i>

25:11.654 --> 25:13.558
<i>She looks</i>
<i>like she's just losing it.</i>

25:13.558 --> 25:15.394
Emotions either can bring
the best out of her

25:15.394 --> 25:16.731
or the worst out of her,

25:16.731 --> 25:18.568
<i>so I'm a little worried</i>
<i>for her right now.</i>

25:20.404 --> 25:22.341
No.
Why it's not catching?

25:22.341 --> 25:24.847
Eboni, you don't have
to flambé it.

25:24.847 --> 25:26.249
Aah!

25:26.249 --> 25:27.318
This ( bleep )
would not catch.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.255
‐ I'm worried about Eboni.
‐ Yeah.

25:29.255 --> 25:32.128
I mean, all of a sudden
Eboni is feeling the heat.

25:32.128 --> 25:33.598
Eboni:
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

25:33.598 --> 25:35.467
My sake won't catch.
I can't flambé it.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.506
<i>I'm all over the place</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

25:37.506 --> 25:38.608
<i>I'm freaking losing it.</i>

25:38.608 --> 25:41.614
Aah!
This is killing me.

25:41.614 --> 25:43.450
I cannot get this to catch.

25:43.450 --> 25:45.321
Gordon:
Oh, dear.

25:45.321 --> 25:46.557
Eboni:
Oh, my God.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.136
No.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.673
I'm worried about Eboni.

25:55.675 --> 25:57.144
Aah!

25:57.144 --> 25:59.048
‐ This ( bleep )
would not catch.
‐ Oh, dear.

25:59.048 --> 26:02.421
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ It doesn't have to catch.
It just needs to cook down.

26:04.693 --> 26:05.929
‐ All right, Miss Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:05.929 --> 26:08.266
‐ What's going on?
‐ The fire won't catch.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.270
Okay. Well,
let's bring it down
a little bit.

26:10.270 --> 26:12.174
You might want
to hold those crawfish
out to the side

26:12.174 --> 26:14.680
and see if you can get
a little flame on there.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.383
Alcohol, get a little
more in there.

26:16.383 --> 26:18.521
Pour it in and then, boom,
on the flame.

26:18.521 --> 26:20.324
A little closer.
Pull it back.

26:20.324 --> 26:22.028
‐ Here we go.
‐ You got it.

26:22.028 --> 26:23.296
All right, now, Eboni,

26:23.296 --> 26:25.200
‐ you're from Chicago.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.236
What's your relationship
with crawfish?

26:26.236 --> 26:27.806
Don't have a relationship
with crawfish,

26:27.806 --> 26:29.475
but I have a relationship
with dumpling.

26:29.475 --> 26:32.014
I make it for my husband.
It's actually one
of his favorite things

26:32.014 --> 26:33.651
that he like to eat,
so I make those at home,

26:33.651 --> 26:35.220
so I should be good
on that portion.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.024
‐ All right, keep your eye
on that clock.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.661
15 minutes remaining.

26:38.661 --> 26:41.701
Get organized.
Let's go.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.336
‐ Right, Jeff,
how you feeling?
‐ Doing very well.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.338
Are you a big
dumpling maker?

26:44.338 --> 26:45.742
I don't make 'em
often at home.

26:45.742 --> 26:47.779
However, my brother‐in‐law,
who's Vietnamese,

26:47.779 --> 26:49.683
we cook a lot of Asian food
all together,

26:49.683 --> 26:51.386
so this is gonna make a nice
tribute to my brother‐in‐law.

26:51.386 --> 26:52.622
How important is
the top 10 for you?

26:52.622 --> 26:54.459
Top 10 would be everything,
but at the end of the day,

26:54.459 --> 26:55.795
ten is just the midway point,

26:55.795 --> 26:57.364
so I'm not gonna stop
just yet.

26:57.364 --> 26:58.868
Number one's the only one
that really matters.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.270
‐ Come on, you can do this.
‐ Certainly.

27:02.475 --> 27:04.145
‐ Adam, talk to me, young man.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:04.145 --> 27:05.481
Do you have your broth
rocking and rolling or what?

27:05.481 --> 27:06.650
Broth is rocking
and rolling, Chef.

27:06.650 --> 27:07.819
Have you made
dumplings before?

27:07.819 --> 27:09.155
I have made
dumplings before.

27:09.155 --> 27:11.527
I think I got a leg up
on most people here

27:11.527 --> 27:13.564
because I eat a lot of
Chinese food back at home.

27:13.564 --> 27:15.501
I know how to fold dumplings,
I know how dumplings work,

27:15.501 --> 27:16.670
and how to fill dumplings
pretty well.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.006
And so I feel pretty good.

27:18.006 --> 27:19.175
Adam, keep it going,
all right?

27:19.175 --> 27:21.045
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

27:21.045 --> 27:22.849
Ten minutes remaining.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.352
Let's go, speed up.

27:24.352 --> 27:27.191
Christina:
You want the top 10, guys?
You better move.

27:27.191 --> 27:28.226
Let's go.

27:31.299 --> 27:32.969
Ugh.

27:32.969 --> 27:34.973
Aarón:
I think Adam would do a great
job making these dumplings.

27:34.973 --> 27:37.712
He does have a really good
background in making dumplings.

27:37.712 --> 27:40.885
‐ Yeah, baby.
‐ I'm just concerned
that his overconfidence

27:40.885 --> 27:43.891
might leave out some really
vital details of that dish.

27:43.891 --> 27:46.462
‐ That's one.
‐ Christina: Now, Gabriel,

27:46.462 --> 27:47.464
he's not that familiar
with dumplings.

27:47.464 --> 27:49.235
‐ Yeah.
‐ Damn it.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.107
Gabriel's a little
out of his depth tonight,
guys, I'm not gonna lie.

27:53.109 --> 27:54.947
What is Jen doing?

27:54.947 --> 27:56.416
Shoot.
It's a little dark.

27:56.416 --> 27:57.986
Is that supposed
to be that dark?

27:57.986 --> 28:00.825
‐ Oh, my gosh.
‐ Jenny's broth
is so dark in color.

28:00.825 --> 28:02.562
Aarón:
It looks very reduced.

28:02.562 --> 28:04.031
Difference between
a broth an a sauce.

28:04.031 --> 28:06.102
And it's gonna be very salty
if it reduces too much.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.939
Gordon:
Last five minutes.

28:07.939 --> 28:09.475
Three minute steam,

28:09.475 --> 28:11.780
it'll take you
90 seconds to plate.

28:13.116 --> 28:14.553
Come on.

28:14.553 --> 28:16.957
Gordon: Get organized
and get that broth nailed.

28:16.957 --> 28:20.598
The flavor
is the essence tonight.

28:20.598 --> 28:23.236
Christina: Looks like
Jeff is still actually
steaming his dumplings.

28:23.236 --> 28:25.575
If he doesn't give
himself enough time,
he won't have time to plate.

28:25.575 --> 28:27.411
‐ Gordon: Come on.
‐ Christina: Push, guys, push.

28:27.411 --> 28:28.581
‐ Gordon: One minute, come on.
‐ Christina: Let's go.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.083
Gordon:
Come on, speed up, guys.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.486
Christina: Aagh!

28:31.486 --> 28:33.089
90 seconds, everyone.

28:33.089 --> 28:35.595
For five of you,
that means the top 10,
let's go.

28:35.595 --> 28:38.266
Gordon:
Serve your best dumplings.

28:38.266 --> 28:39.770
Finishing touches,
let's go.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.272
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ Gordon: Here we go.

28:41.272 --> 28:43.109
‐ Gordon: Ten.
‐ Judges: Nine.

28:43.109 --> 28:46.149
Eight, seven, six,

28:46.149 --> 28:49.221
five, four, three,

28:49.221 --> 28:51.159
two, one.

28:51.159 --> 28:53.664
‐ And stop. Hands in the air.
‐ Hands in the air!

28:53.664 --> 28:57.404
‐ ( applause )
‐ Well done.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.308
All right,
home cooks, please,

28:59.308 --> 29:03.016
very carefully bring
your dishes to the front.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.523
Gabriel:
<i>I've never made</i>
<i>dumplings before,</i>

29:06.523 --> 29:10.665
so I'm not really
particularly confident
with my dish.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.936
I hope I did enough
to really redeem myself

29:12.936 --> 29:14.372
<i>and push me in the top 10.</i>

29:18.279 --> 29:22.287
Now it's time to see
who's clawed their way
into the top 10...

29:22.287 --> 29:24.526
and who is going home.

29:24.526 --> 29:26.029
Let's see how you did.

29:30.170 --> 29:31.974
‐ Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

29:31.974 --> 29:34.412
‐ How do you feel that went?
‐ It was definitely
a task, Chef.

29:34.412 --> 29:35.748
I was a little nervous
at the beginning.

29:35.748 --> 29:37.051
Just had to
wrap my head around it

29:37.051 --> 29:38.554
and tell myself,
"You need to stop,

29:38.554 --> 29:40.323
just focus on the dish."
I think I was trying

29:40.323 --> 29:41.927
to be very
detail‐oriented.

29:41.927 --> 29:44.833
What I question right now
is there's a lot of
chili threads.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.337
That has the potential
of really ruining the dish.

29:47.337 --> 29:50.177
That can actually
permeate into the broth
and overwhelm it.

29:50.177 --> 29:51.947
That could be disastrous.

29:53.349 --> 29:54.686
Let's see how we did here.

29:58.861 --> 30:01.600
I've gotta say,
the broth, I think it's...

30:15.093 --> 30:17.832
I've gotta say,
the broth, I think it's...

30:23.243 --> 30:25.147
‐ ...dynamite.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

30:25.147 --> 30:27.752
Wow.
I like the color of the broth.

30:27.752 --> 30:30.090
It's translucent.
It really leads me to believe

30:30.090 --> 30:31.960
that you caramelized
the vegetables enough.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.597
And that filling is balanced.

30:33.597 --> 30:35.668
It has the right amount
of herbs to it.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.505
It's perfumed lovely
'cause of the ginger.

30:37.505 --> 30:38.541
What would I do differently?

30:38.541 --> 30:40.545
I mean, I would
just dump some more

30:40.545 --> 30:42.882
of that delicious
filling in there,
but that's it.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.886
Really spot on, young man.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.124
I thought you did
a great replication
of Chef Ramsay's dish.

30:47.124 --> 30:48.393
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Well done.

30:48.393 --> 30:49.829
Good job, Gabe.

30:51.365 --> 30:53.169
‐ Jenny.
‐ Yes, Chef.

30:53.169 --> 30:56.142
At first glance, I think
that your dumplings

30:56.142 --> 30:58.246
‐ look quite beautiful.
‐ Thank you.

30:58.246 --> 31:00.518
But the thing
that I'm seeing immediately

31:00.518 --> 31:02.254
when I'm looking
at the color of your broth,

31:02.254 --> 31:05.193
that's really dark
and really murky.

31:05.193 --> 31:07.665
‐ What happened there?
‐ The broth got away
from me a little bit.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.805
I wasn't fully
comfortable making
a broth and everything,

31:10.805 --> 31:12.307
but I tried to
do the best I could

31:12.307 --> 31:14.044
to be able to execute
the flavors properly.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.019
It's salty.

31:18.019 --> 31:20.691
It goes from salty to acrid,

31:20.691 --> 31:24.298
but it's meant to be
this light, aromatic broth.

31:24.298 --> 31:26.637
And the darkness
could certainly be because

31:26.637 --> 31:29.174
‐ you applied
so much heat to it,
‐ Okay.

31:29.174 --> 31:32.882
‐ that you started
to burn the sake.
‐ Okay.

31:32.882 --> 31:35.888
Let's take a closer look
at one of these dumplings.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.706
The filling is
a little off‐balanced.

31:44.706 --> 31:47.612
A little too much ginger
in the scallion.

31:47.612 --> 31:50.618
I think you did a beautiful
job of making the dumplings,

31:50.618 --> 31:52.254
but they didn't have
enough time to steam.

31:52.254 --> 31:53.924
They're a little dry
and crunchy on the top.

31:53.924 --> 31:56.062
Is this dish gonna
send you home tonight?

31:56.062 --> 31:58.567
‐ We're gonna have to see.
‐ Yes, Chef.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.909
Adam.

32:02.909 --> 32:04.178
Yes, Chef.

32:04.178 --> 32:05.648
How many dumplings have
you made in your life?

32:05.648 --> 32:08.052
‐ A couple hundred.
‐ Couple hundred, yes.

32:08.052 --> 32:10.056
So, visually...

32:12.895 --> 32:15.735
the dumplings
look dreadful.

32:15.735 --> 32:18.239
They look awful.

32:18.239 --> 32:20.343
I mean, honestly.
Come on.

32:20.343 --> 32:22.915
Three completely
different‐looking shapes.

32:22.915 --> 32:25.353
Okay, let's get
in there, shall we?

32:25.353 --> 32:27.692
Now, let's go
for the largest one.

32:27.692 --> 32:30.130
‐ What's the ratio?
‐ I'd say 80% crawfish,

32:30.130 --> 32:31.933
and the rest of the 20%
is equal parts

32:31.933 --> 32:34.873
of shallots,
cilantro, and ginger.

32:36.409 --> 32:38.112
Uh... oh dear.

32:38.112 --> 32:41.152
The dumplings are appalling.

32:41.152 --> 32:42.789
How much garlic
did you put in there?

32:42.789 --> 32:44.626
I put two cloves
of garlic, Chef.

32:44.626 --> 32:46.228
Two cloves of garlic.

32:46.228 --> 32:47.765
The mistake
you've made, young man,

32:47.765 --> 32:50.971
is that any essence of luxury
in and amongst those crawfish

32:50.971 --> 32:53.009
has been flattened by garlic,
'cause I'm just‐‐

32:53.009 --> 32:55.648
I'm ready
to have a mouthwash
or brush my teeth.

32:57.752 --> 32:59.488
‐ Just way too strong.
‐ Yes, Chef.

32:59.488 --> 33:01.091
I think the broth
is delicious.

33:01.091 --> 33:03.095
I want to go to the broth
more than I do the dumpling.

33:03.095 --> 33:07.370
But it's a dumpling challenge.
That's my worry.

33:07.370 --> 33:10.109
I'm in shock.
I thought you were
gonna nail it.

33:10.109 --> 33:11.111
Thank you, Chef.

33:15.253 --> 33:17.390
‐ Eboni, how you doing?
‐ I'm all right, Chef.

33:17.390 --> 33:18.493
Have you made
dumplings before?

33:18.493 --> 33:20.296
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Who likes to eat 'em?

33:20.296 --> 33:22.602
‐ My husband, Chef.
‐ I gotta say...

33:26.308 --> 33:28.312
I like your dumplings.

33:28.312 --> 33:30.951
They look like Gordon's,
which is a welcoming sight.

33:30.951 --> 33:34.358
The broth is translucent.
I love the color.
It's vibrant.

33:34.358 --> 33:37.464
I think you chose
the right crawfish tails
to garnish with as well,

33:37.464 --> 33:38.700
which I appreciate.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.370
All right, let's get
into this dumpling.

33:40.370 --> 33:41.773
Do you feel like
you have a nice ratio

33:41.773 --> 33:43.142
of dumpling
to the actual crimp?

33:43.142 --> 33:45.380
Yes.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.685
So when I cut this open,
what should be the composition?

33:47.685 --> 33:50.858
It's gonna be tons
of herbs, garlic,
scallion, some ginger.

33:52.962 --> 33:55.199
I gotta say...

33:55.199 --> 33:57.170
that broth is dynamite.

33:57.170 --> 33:59.308
It's well‐seasoned.
It has the right amount

33:59.308 --> 34:00.711
of salt from the fish sauce.

34:00.711 --> 34:02.748
It has a good
amount of heat,
which I appreciate.

34:02.748 --> 34:04.418
I think the filling is good.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.790
It's seasoned properly.
Good job.

34:12.200 --> 34:15.006
Okay, Miss Caitlin.
How'd it go?

34:15.006 --> 34:16.810
I feel like
it went really well.

34:16.810 --> 34:19.047
In your broth, how many
times did you strain it
through cheesecloth?

34:19.047 --> 34:21.018
I strained it
through a triple layer

34:21.018 --> 34:23.356
of cheesecloth
just one time.

34:23.356 --> 34:25.894
All right.
Your broth is...

34:27.163 --> 34:28.867
beautiful.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.138
It's clear
you clearly spent
a lot of time

34:31.138 --> 34:33.510
in making sure
that you didn't
heat it too quickly.

34:33.510 --> 34:35.914
You didn't cloud it up.
Let's just take this off.

34:35.914 --> 34:38.887
It's like a bird's nest
up there, huh?

34:38.887 --> 34:41.660
Dumpling‐wise, they kind of
look a little different in size.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.095
This one looks
a little bit smaller.

34:43.095 --> 34:45.033
‐ This one looks
a little bigger.
‐ Yes, Chef.

34:45.033 --> 34:46.536
Let's have a look.

34:46.536 --> 34:47.538
How much sesame oil
did you use?

34:47.538 --> 34:49.408
Just a few drops.

34:49.408 --> 34:50.544
I tasted it
before I cooked it.

34:50.544 --> 34:52.047
I thought the flavor
was pretty good.

34:58.694 --> 35:00.698
Yowser.
The broth's great.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.067
Thank you.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.872
A little bit of that edge
of the crawfish.

35:04.872 --> 35:07.143
You know you're getting
some shellfish there,

35:07.143 --> 35:08.714
and then it disappears
really gently.

35:08.714 --> 35:12.020
Farce is okay.
A little too much sesame oil.

35:12.020 --> 35:13.724
‐ Got it.
‐ But pretty strong effort.

35:13.724 --> 35:15.059
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Yeah.

35:16.195 --> 35:19.569
‐ Jeff.
‐ Yes, Chef.

35:19.569 --> 35:21.238
So...

35:21.238 --> 35:23.610
visually, what do you
think of that?

35:23.610 --> 35:26.950
I think the only thing
that was my biggest concern
was the broth.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.555
So, visually...

35:32.928 --> 35:37.938
the first one tonight
that got all four dumplings

35:37.938 --> 35:40.076
the same size.

35:40.076 --> 35:42.615
It just shows restraint.
Now, broth.

35:42.615 --> 35:44.317
Could have a little bit
more clarity,

35:44.317 --> 35:46.723
‐ but it's got
that nice color.
‐ Thank you.

35:46.723 --> 35:48.225
Did you sweat off
the garlic as well?

35:48.225 --> 35:51.298
Just slightly.
Just so I could get
some of that bite off of it.

35:51.298 --> 35:53.603
‐ What did you season with?
‐ A little bit of cilantro,

35:53.603 --> 35:55.072
a little bit
of the scallions
to it there,

35:55.072 --> 35:57.310
some sesame oil
to bring that all together

35:57.310 --> 35:59.582
as I sweated the garlics
and the shallots.

36:01.151 --> 36:02.755
‐ Flavor of the broth
is exceptional.
‐ Thank you.

36:02.755 --> 36:05.594
Let's get that right.
I mean, absolutely nailed it.

36:05.594 --> 36:07.698
I like what you've done
with the dumplings.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.301
I just want them
a little bit bigger.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.205
‐ Okay.
‐ Because a dumpling
in a sort of Asian style

36:11.205 --> 36:12.741
is sort of
bursting at the seams,

36:12.741 --> 36:14.879
and tonight I think
you played it safe,

36:14.879 --> 36:17.651
and it could have done
with 25% more mix in there.

36:17.651 --> 36:20.456
But everything that's
in there is delicious.

36:20.456 --> 36:22.060
‐ Thank you.
‐ Great job.

36:22.060 --> 36:23.262
Thank you.

36:23.262 --> 36:24.632
Jeff:
<i>I mean, for a guy</i>

36:24.632 --> 36:26.636
<i>who's never made</i>
<i>dumplings before,</i>

36:26.636 --> 36:27.638
<i>I've gotta say,</i>

36:27.638 --> 36:30.142
I did it.
I nailed it.

36:30.142 --> 36:32.180
‐ Good job, Jeff.
‐ Thank you.

36:32.180 --> 36:35.286
<i>And it shows everybody else</i>
<i>that I'm still a threat</i>

36:35.286 --> 36:38.793
because this right here
is gonna take me all the way
to the top.

36:44.872 --> 36:46.375
Aarón:
That was a tough challenge.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.379
You all proved
that you do have
some skills.

36:48.379 --> 36:51.552
But the fact of the matter
is that you cannot all

36:51.552 --> 36:54.491
make the top 10
of "MasterChef."

36:54.491 --> 36:57.230
One of you
will be going home tonight.

36:59.735 --> 37:02.608
Please, give us
a moment to discuss.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.356
Incredible.
There were some serious
highlights there.

37:10.356 --> 37:12.293
I gotta say,
for me, Gabriel,

37:12.293 --> 37:15.834
he did the best job
of executing a really
great dumpling,

37:15.834 --> 37:18.673
beautiful presentation,
in a very flavorful,
well‐balanced broth.

37:18.673 --> 37:19.842
Yeah.

37:19.842 --> 37:21.345
I folded everything,
I crimped it,

37:21.345 --> 37:22.681
and then pulled it
all together.

37:22.681 --> 37:23.850
For me, Jeff
brought it together.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.954
Jeff's got the least
amount of filling there,

37:25.954 --> 37:27.658
but the broth for me
was broth of the night.

37:27.658 --> 37:30.296
And there are two
that are not such a standout.

37:30.296 --> 37:33.002
‐ The big shock
for me is Adam.
‐ You're okay.

37:33.002 --> 37:35.674
I guess I'd rather
have an ugly dumpling
that tasted fantastic

37:35.674 --> 37:37.377
‐ than a stunning‐looking
dumpling.
‐ Yeah.

37:37.377 --> 37:39.515
I'm proud
of what I've done.

37:39.515 --> 37:41.986
Christina:
Jenny, for me, was just
such a disappointment,

37:41.986 --> 37:43.556
because
her dumplings themselves

37:43.556 --> 37:45.092
are actually very well done,

37:45.092 --> 37:46.361
but if you have a bad broth,

37:46.361 --> 37:48.032
it doesn't matter
what the dumpling is.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.267
You've got no chance
to pull it back.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.340
Hey, don't count
yourself out.

37:53.877 --> 37:54.879
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah, good?

37:54.879 --> 37:56.281
Yeah.

38:03.530 --> 38:05.399
Six home cooks,

38:05.399 --> 38:08.573
but only five spots
left on the balcony.

38:08.573 --> 38:10.844
That means that one of you
is leaving tonight.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.552
Eboni, please step forward.

38:18.425 --> 38:19.427
Jeff.

38:23.068 --> 38:25.005
Caitlin.

38:27.511 --> 38:29.682
And...

38:29.682 --> 38:31.118
Gabriel.

38:37.063 --> 38:39.568
Congratulations.
You guys have made it
to the top 10.

38:39.568 --> 38:41.037
Please go up to the balcony.
Thank you.

38:41.037 --> 38:43.308
Yay!
Come on up, guys.

38:43.308 --> 38:44.812
Eboni:
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>to be in the top 10.</i>

38:44.812 --> 38:46.949
This is like the best,

38:46.949 --> 38:49.922
<i>the most amazing feeling</i>
<i>I could ever have.</i>

38:49.922 --> 38:51.659
I have accomplished something

38:51.659 --> 38:53.963
and I'm feeling
real good right now.

38:56.468 --> 39:01.612
Adam, you delivered three
inconsistent‐sized dumplings,

39:01.612 --> 39:04.585
heavy handed
on the garlic inside.

39:04.585 --> 39:07.624
Jenny, the actual broth
was a letdown,

39:07.624 --> 39:10.396
because it was more
of a sauce than a broth.

39:10.396 --> 39:12.768
You can't serve a dumpling

39:12.768 --> 39:16.041
with a sauce
that's reduced so far down

39:16.041 --> 39:17.978
that it's almost
beyond edible.

39:19.314 --> 39:21.986
Adam, Jenny,
only one of you

39:21.986 --> 39:25.492
is going to join
the nine on the balcony.

39:25.492 --> 39:26.762
Based on the performance

39:26.762 --> 39:29.935
purely across
the last 20 minutes...

39:29.935 --> 39:32.240
the individual
that is not entering

39:32.240 --> 39:35.145
into the top 10
of this competition...

39:35.145 --> 39:36.147
is...

39:44.030 --> 39:45.767
Jenny.

39:45.767 --> 39:46.769
I'm sorry, young lady.

39:49.307 --> 39:50.442
It's okay.

39:52.514 --> 39:56.288
Adam, upstairs quickly.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.538
Jenny, you've been amazing.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.911
This journey, how's it been?

40:07.911 --> 40:10.049
You know,
it's the bumpiest journey
I've been on,

40:10.049 --> 40:12.153
the hardest thing
I've ever done,

40:12.153 --> 40:15.527
but the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

40:15.527 --> 40:18.432
We have seen a massive change.
Be proud of that.

40:18.432 --> 40:20.770
Thank you guys so much
for everything.

40:20.770 --> 40:22.874
Please, come up here
and say goodbye,
my darling.

40:24.110 --> 40:26.214
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thanks.

40:26.214 --> 40:27.450
Great job, Jenny.
You're amazing.

40:27.450 --> 40:30.623
‐ Oh, dear.
‐ Mama, you keep going.

40:30.623 --> 40:32.594
Gordon: Take your apron off
and place it on your bench.

40:32.594 --> 40:34.397
‐ Thank you, Jenny.
‐ I love you guys.

40:34.397 --> 40:35.967
We love you, Jenny.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.136
Jenny:
<i>I'm disappointed.</i>

40:37.136 --> 40:38.806
<i>It's a bummer</i>
<i>to be going home.</i>

40:38.806 --> 40:41.311
Top 10 was like this close.

40:41.311 --> 40:43.382
‐ Jenny, I'm gon' miss you.
‐ We're gonna miss you.

40:43.382 --> 40:47.724
<i>This competition has changed</i>
<i>my life in so many ways.</i>

40:47.724 --> 40:51.766
<i>I'm really, really</i>
<i>proud with the person</i>
<i>that I've become,</i>

40:51.766 --> 40:53.569
the confidence I've gained...

40:53.569 --> 40:56.675
‐ Gonna miss you, Jenny.
‐ Love you, Jenny.

40:56.675 --> 40:59.815
...and the passion that's been
really invigorated in me.

40:59.815 --> 41:01.819
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>for the next step.</i>

41:06.094 --> 41:08.098
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:08.098 --> 41:12.139
Two world‐renowned chefs
are gonna cook alongside you.

41:12.139 --> 41:14.578
‐ <i>the home cooks...</i>
‐ Gordon: Please welcome...

41:14.578 --> 41:16.147
<i>...meet their match.</i>

41:16.147 --> 41:17.617
We're completely screwed.

41:17.617 --> 41:19.487
‐ <i>And when the top 10...</i>
‐ Coming around you.

41:19.487 --> 41:20.723
‐ <i>pair up...</i>
‐ Whoo!

41:20.723 --> 41:21.759
Chicken, chicken, chicken,
chicken, chicken.

41:21.759 --> 41:23.629
<i>teammates become enemies...</i>

41:23.629 --> 41:25.633
I don't like these blobs.
Very distasteful.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.571
‐ ( bleep )
‐ I got this.
Don't worry about this.

41:27.571 --> 41:29.440
<i>leading to a performance</i>
<i>so shocking...</i>

41:29.440 --> 41:31.010
Christina:
That's embarrassing.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.446
‐ <i>two...</i>
‐ It's kind of boring.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.749
<i>...could be going home.</i>

41:33.749 --> 41:34.852
‐ Oh.
‐ Oof.

41:34.852 --> 41:36.321
Disgusting.
