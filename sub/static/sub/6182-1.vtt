01:42.670 --> 01:45.237
Animal. Meat.

My boss, he call over here.
Nothing.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.542

"I can hear the sound-- this animal."

I need some air.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.600
This is no kind of thing.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.569
I don't want to hide.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.314
They're little.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.350

03:05.352 --> 03:08.287
but... They're yours,

03:08.289 --> 03:10.956
so you get attached.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.758
It's not offbeat.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.694
It's news,
and if you put it in offbeat,

03:15.696 --> 03:18.530
it makes it-- it makes it sound like a joke.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.699

good story, raj.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.559
To the tiger.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.494
May the road rise.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.664

09:44.884 --> 09:48.253
Why?
I'm getting back to basics.

standing here?

But really we would just end up
standing around the parking lot.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.503
Oh, yeah?
Like making out and stuff?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.873
- [Todd] more than that.
- [John] I'm sure.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.408
I'm pretty sure I opened the back hatch of someone's--

14:37.410 --> 14:39.344
- [John] No, no, no, no, no.
- Of someone's--

14:39.346 --> 14:39.344
[Mel]
We're not talking about that.

14:39.346 --> 14:43.548
[Todd] I'm sorry that I brought it up.
Who was it in the back?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.216
[John] Come on, please.
[Mel] stop it.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.918
Can you not--
stop it.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.887
Well, despite
our elderliness,

14:48.889 --> 14:52.457
some things remain
from our youth.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.158
[Alarm chirps]
No.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.361
I get up so early.
It's torture. Me too.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.496
I have to go.
I'm asleep right now.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.166
Good night.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.968
Just--

15:03.970 --> 15:05.570
no, don't go.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
Shit.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.389
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.929
It's probably the same shit
as before.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.064
I wasn't here in 2000,
so I don't know.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.000
You've gotta log the pressure in these tanks every day.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.636
They drop below 10 or above 30,
you gotta let me know.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.939
I remember.
The ritual.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.511
I usually cut the grass about once a week,
every 10 days.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.949
When it gets really high,
I try to keep it out of the pool.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.186
You got the hook
over there.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.561
Got new chairs.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.032
All right then.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.469
Here are the keys.
I'm usually around unless I'm not.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.638
Don't skimp
on the cleaning.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.406
I will not.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.108
Okay.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.078
Hello.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.115
Hi.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.778
Hey.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.546
I'm little jason.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.748
My dad's big jason,
head of maintenance.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.517
Leigh.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.585
New lifeguard.
Yep.

17:38.824 --> 17:41.492
I-- I live right there.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.494
Apartment in the garage.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.297
Oh.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.067
Oh. Yeah.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.722
See ya.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.232
[Fence rattling]

18:28.874 --> 18:31.209
<i>¶ [Rock, Muffled]</i>

18:36.515 --> 18:38.749
Hey.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.418
Hi.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.886
[Grunts]

18:43.122 --> 18:44.522
[Water splashing]

18:46.225 --> 18:48.259
[Whistle blows]
No running.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.462
Hey!
[Whistle blows]

18:51.464 --> 18:53.131
No running!

19:02.508 --> 19:04.475
What are you doing
in here?

19:06.311 --> 19:09.413
[Gasps] Stop!
Oh, my god! Stop it!

19:09.415 --> 19:11.782
Fuck you,
you fucking bitch!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.851
Suck my dick.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.686
Excuse me?

19:15.688 --> 19:19.290
You need to leave the pool, now.
Get out.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.660
- No, bitch. Suck it.
- Get out! Out! Out!

19:22.662 --> 19:24.629
Right now! Get out!

19:27.799 --> 19:30.234
No running!
Fuck you!

19:30.236 --> 19:31.836
You're fucking ugly!

19:31.838 --> 19:34.539
Get out, now!

19:48.887 --> 19:50.821
Leigh.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.191
Small jason.
How you doin'?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.659
Fine.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.796
Can I have a cigarette?

20:16.915 --> 20:19.650
Do you know the kids
who live here?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.385
Some of 'em.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.621
Do you know one
who's about 10...

20:23.623 --> 20:27.358
But he looks like
a 1930s italian gangster...

20:27.360 --> 20:29.493
Except shrunk
into a miniature,

20:29.495 --> 20:31.796
and he's really obnoxious
like he has no mother?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.632
Aaron.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.534
He has a mom.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.739
She's fat-- to, like,
the point of not moving.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.709
Why? He can't come to the pool anymore.
He's banned.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.478
Why?

20:49.014 --> 20:51.549
Because he wouldn't listen,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.752
and he and his friends
swore at me,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.754
and they wouldn't listen.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.791
And I'm not--

21:00.793 --> 21:03.327
I'm not invisible.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.896
I'm the fuckin' lifeguard,
motherfucker.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.805
And some cunt just sat
over there in her chair,

21:14.807 --> 21:17.975
flipping through her magazine
like I didn't even need her help.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.944
Oh, shit.
Whoa.

21:21.546 --> 21:23.547
Well, she was.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.718
I'm not a babysitter.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.854
I'm not here
to be screamed at.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.823
You gonna quit?

21:33.925 --> 21:35.993
I don't want to.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.995
I really don't, but--

21:44.770 --> 21:47.305
thought you were supposed
to be healthy, lifeguard.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.942
I'm just supposed to
make sure you don't die.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.317
You're talking about
middle schoolers?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.552
There were four of them.

22:01.554 --> 22:05.323
Leigh, were they standing on each other's shoulders,
or how did this--

22:05.325 --> 22:08.592
I told mel
we'd pick her up later.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.329
Do we have reservations?
For what?

22:11.331 --> 22:14.498
Let's just, you know,
do whatever.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.934
You don't even have to come.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.670
Really. It might not even
be fun for you.

22:19.672 --> 22:23.007
If you don't want me to come,
just say so, okay?

22:24.743 --> 22:28.012
Maybe stay home?
Is that okay?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.514
I just want to get it out of her-- you know,
what she's doing.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.417
And then I'll come home
and tell you everything.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.120
Yeah.
I really don't care.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.923
You don't... Care?

22:42.394 --> 22:44.628
You can't drink though.

22:44.630 --> 22:48.999
One glass of red wine
is... Fine.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.869
Honestly. How else would
french women get pregnant?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.839
Oh, okay. Yeah.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.574
Whatever, mel.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.581
[Whispers]
Asshole.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.049
[Exhales]

23:06.017 --> 23:08.486
Hey.
Mmm. Jesus.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.955
Hi. So--

23:13.058 --> 23:14.825
lifeguard.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.560
Yeah?

23:16.562 --> 23:19.096
Can you buy us beer?

23:19.098 --> 23:22.433
Please? Yeah.
Lumpy's brother was supposed to,

23:22.435 --> 23:26.003
but circumstances
intervened.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.072
No.
Why?

23:28.074 --> 23:30.741
I mean, because
we have lives...

23:30.743 --> 23:34.879
That don't need to be interrupted
by the long arm of the law.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.714
What would we
get out of it?

23:37.682 --> 23:39.150
I don't know.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.051
I think you do.

23:41.053 --> 23:46.991
What is valuable to someone
looking to broaden his mind?

23:46.993 --> 23:50.161
Something you could perhaps purchase.
It grows in nature.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.565
Oh.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.867
A moment, please,
while we conference.

23:58.203 --> 24:00.438
What about mel?

24:00.440 --> 24:02.973
I don't know, lifeguard.
What about mel?

24:04.142 --> 24:06.544
No. No, no, no.
Excuse me.

24:06.546 --> 24:10.047
You didn't say anything about getting
weed from my 16-year-old students.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.749
They look older.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.018
Yeah. No.
We should go then.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.753
Hey. No. No.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.988
If you're so worried,
then don't do it.

24:17.990 --> 24:22.726
Oh, that's so much fun.
I'm so glad that I left my car at home.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.095
Then do it.
They'll think you're awesome.

24:25.097 --> 24:29.700
Keep your voice down. No.
This is not-- I could get fired.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.670
'Sup?
Vice principal smith-lentz.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.172
[Sighs]

24:35.174 --> 24:38.509
Hi, boys.
Um-- all right.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.011
Let's talk about this,
because this is potentially...

24:41.013 --> 24:44.515
Very confusing, I think,
for everyone.

24:44.517 --> 24:48.519
I came here with these people not
knowing what they were intending to do...

24:48.521 --> 24:51.689
Or with whom...

24:51.691 --> 24:54.692
Or... What.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.895
I don't care if you smoke weed with us...

24:59.164 --> 25:01.632
Because
I'm droppin' out.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.968
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.870
Are you insane?

25:05.872 --> 25:08.239
Do-- do you actually want to face this cold,
harsh world...

25:08.241 --> 25:10.508
Without
a high school diploma?

25:10.510 --> 25:12.776
Why don't you just blind yourself while you're at it?

25:12.778 --> 25:16.046
No.
I hate it here.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.715
We're moving
to Vermont.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.984
- [Mel] Vermont?
- Yeah.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.253
I definitely am.
My sister's up there.

25:22.255 --> 25:26.056
Yeah, my mom's there with my stepdad,
like an hour away.

25:27.225 --> 25:28.659
It's way better
than here.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.761
You heard
what they said.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.797
They're not
your students, so--

25:33.799 --> 25:35.299
shall we?
Todd?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.902
Great.
No. This is wrong.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.937
To you, it is, mel.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.239
Not to the rest of us.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.675
Oh, wow.
This is-- now you see what I have to put up with.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.677
Mm-hmm. But--

25:46.679 --> 25:48.979
I-- hey. Hey.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.249
No, I do not approve
of this!

26:00.926 --> 26:03.594
You went to RH.S. Too?

26:03.596 --> 26:05.729
Yeah.

26:05.731 --> 26:09.600
Um, leigh was actually
valedictorian.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.870
What were you?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.306
Um, I--

26:15.308 --> 26:17.975
well--

26:17.977 --> 26:22.313
leonard, it actually took me
until after high school...

26:22.315 --> 26:24.915
To really focus.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.584
Really?

26:27.886 --> 26:29.353
Oh, yeah.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.328
[Todd] Do not share this
location with anyone unworthy.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.601
Does the old lady have, like,
a fuckin' shotgun for trespassers?

26:43.603 --> 26:45.703
She doesn't have
a shotgun.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.707
But if I find out any
of your friends came here...

26:49.709 --> 26:52.776
And desecrated
a tiger lily...

26:52.778 --> 26:54.878
Or littered,
I <i>will</i> have a shotgun.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.247
[Chuckling]

26:57.249 --> 26:58.882
That's cool.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.723
What?
Don't be an idiot.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.825
Just--

27:07.827 --> 27:10.361
I wish I could
impress that upon you.

27:13.331 --> 27:15.899
Okay.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.669
I know you think
this town is bad...

27:18.671 --> 27:20.771
And, you know,
you need to leave,

27:20.773 --> 27:24.675
but I don't think you realize how
privileged this experience is.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.314
How's it privileged?

27:36.354 --> 27:38.789
Nature, for one.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.726
Excellent public school
education,

27:42.728 --> 27:45.162
for two.

27:45.164 --> 27:50.367
It's safe.
You're sheltered-- which you never will be again.

27:50.369 --> 27:54.004
Well, me and him
get arrested one more time,

27:54.006 --> 27:56.707
we're tried as adults.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.143
My classes suck, so--

27:59.145 --> 28:01.178
well, stop doing
dumb shit, "a."

28:01.180 --> 28:03.747
And "b,"
Your classes don't suck.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.716
I'm in special ed.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.354
I have AD.D., so--

28:15.326 --> 28:17.094
what?

28:17.096 --> 28:22.066
Having AD.D. Does not mean
you should be in special ed.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.035
Thanks.

28:26.237 --> 28:27.905
I know.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.381
Orion's belt.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.420
Big dipper.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.326
Mmm... Seven sisters.

28:58.770 --> 29:02.005
You're 16.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.344
You have no idea
how lucky you are right now.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.091
[Engine off]

29:21.093 --> 29:23.127
Thank you for driving.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.497
That was...
Probably unfortunate.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.505
Fuck you guys.

29:36.441 --> 29:41.078
- What?
- I really needed to have fun tonight.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.880
And you didn't even care.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.549
And you don't even--

29:45.551 --> 29:48.952
you never ask
how I am or--

29:48.954 --> 29:52.122
mel, what's-- what's wrong?

29:54.492 --> 29:57.561
It's just really hard,
trying to get pregnant.

29:59.898 --> 30:02.933
I-- I think
that's normal, right?

30:05.069 --> 30:07.304
Isn't your life perfect?

30:08.206 --> 30:10.140
No!

30:10.142 --> 30:11.809
Oh!

30:13.444 --> 30:15.579
Hey. Hey.

30:25.023 --> 30:29.193
I read somewhere they did a
study of children in jamaica...

30:29.195 --> 30:31.495
Whose mothers smoked weed
during utero,

30:31.497 --> 30:35.532
and they were actually happier and
more creative than other children.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.534
I believe that.
Absolutely.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.137
Absolutely.
Mm-hmm.

30:40.139 --> 30:44.241
"Remember to not be too nostalgic for this time.

30:44.243 --> 30:47.244
[Laughing] Our lives are what lay ahead--

30:47.246 --> 30:50.948
[Coughing, laughing] In this
uncharted territory of our dreams.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.516
Aw.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.552
Be brave and bold--
[Mel giggles]

30:56.855 --> 30:59.489
And do not look back,
classmates,

30:59.491 --> 31:02.326
for the future
is meant to be seized...

31:02.328 --> 31:04.862
With both hands."
Both hands.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.964
Oh. So embarrassing.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.167
[Laughing]

31:10.169 --> 31:11.935
Both hands.
Both hands.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.004
Really?
It's that funny? Yeah.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.875
Leigh london,
valedictorian...

31:17.877 --> 31:20.644
And virgin?

31:20.646 --> 31:23.480
Yes. See? What did I know?
[Phone ringing, muffled]

31:23.482 --> 31:26.516
Absolutely nothing.
Mm-hmm.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.185
[Ringing continues]

31:28.187 --> 31:29.620
[Laughing]
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.922
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.991
Hi.
<i>[John speaking, faint]</i>

31:35.226 --> 31:36.894
Right.

31:37.962 --> 31:40.364
I don't want to drive.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.366
[Whispering] tell him you're too tired.
I'm very tired.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.503
I'm tired!

31:46.505 --> 31:48.538
Because I've had
a long week.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.042
No. John, I'm just tired.

31:54.979 --> 31:56.680
Okay.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.049
All right.
See you tomorrow.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.318
Hey. I love you.

32:08.126 --> 32:11.328
I'm sleeping over.
Yes!

32:11.330 --> 32:13.497
I will prepare us
cereal.

32:17.335 --> 32:19.002
[Sighs]

32:20.505 --> 32:22.172
[Exhales]

32:23.508 --> 32:25.475
I'm so jealous of you.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.713
Me? Why?

32:31.683 --> 32:33.483
Because you
get to be lost.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.572
It's okay.
Hey.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.645
I thought you lived
in fox crest.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.248
Yeah.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.752
And you were too fucked up to walk
the 20 yards back to your bed?

33:09.754 --> 33:11.655
My mom kicked me out.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.657
Because you were
fucked up.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.766
[Sighs]
I'm gonna go puke.

33:39.584 --> 33:39.583
Here.

33:43.788 --> 33:48.525
Better be careful, man. You pass out like
that in Vermont, you froze in the snow.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.460
Ah, the myth of Vermont.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.262
Myth?

33:52.264 --> 33:54.297
Shee-at.
It's on the map.

33:57.402 --> 34:00.037
Next week.
Well, that's just not gonna happen, man.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

34:02.174 --> 34:06.343
But that's why I'm trying to have a
conversation with you about cap rates. Right.

34:06.345 --> 34:09.713
Exactly. Yes.
Well, that's why I hired you.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.815
Don't be an asshole about it.
No, we don't trust bankers.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.152
We do not trust bankers.
Okay?

34:17.188 --> 34:19.056
[Dog barking in distance]

34:23.661 --> 34:26.830
We got this guy. When he starts to push back,
that's what you do.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.299
It's sort of like--
right. Yeah.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.302
This is a, uh-- this is a chuck e.
Cheese we're talking about.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.571
Obviously,
don't use that language--

34:34.572 --> 34:36.540
but you know
what I mean.

Most people get better with age with driving.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.643
He's actually gotten worse.
I don't think that's--

35:13.645 --> 35:16.746
no, because you started out
as a fairly good driver.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.183
It was intentional bad driving.
Was it? It was intentional?

35:20.185 --> 35:21.818
Yes.

35:26.757 --> 35:30.160
Leigh?
Give me a m--

35:30.162 --> 35:32.562
number one,
you got a nice community here.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.865
Number two,
you have no respect for--

35:34.867 --> 35:36.666
hey.
Leigh london.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.603
How you doin'?
Hi, rick. How are ya?

35:39.605 --> 35:44.341
Listen, I know these guys.
Can I help at all in this situation?

35:44.343 --> 35:46.576
No.
This is police business.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.679
- They're skating.
- And someone complained?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.916
Or-- is there an ordinance against it?
I didn't think there was.

35:52.918 --> 35:56.153
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to go away now.

35:56.155 --> 36:00.323
Unless you have a valid reason to
be cornering these underage youths,

36:00.325 --> 36:02.792
what you're doing right now
is called harassment.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.495
Maybe I should take you downtown
for impeding an arrest.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.864
Am I impeding
an arrest?

36:07.866 --> 36:11.268
If you have a reason to arrest
them and you can prove it,

36:11.270 --> 36:13.436
then, I mean,
by all means take me down,

36:13.438 --> 36:15.906
'cause I--
I will understand.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.674
No more skating.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.376
But why, rick?

36:19.378 --> 36:21.545
[Chuckles] You're a real piece of work.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.713
You're kind of a bitch,
actually.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.349
I'm sorry.
What was that, Officer?

36:26.351 --> 36:29.686
You know I'm a reporter
for the associated press, right?

36:29.688 --> 36:34.824
[Officer chuckling] Fuckin' nuts.
[Car engine starts]

36:39.230 --> 36:42.232
[John] so you're just gonna take
some time off and then, uh--

36:42.234 --> 36:45.435
I mean, what,
are you thinking of a career change, or, uh--

36:45.437 --> 36:47.737
[Leigh]
Uh, I don't know.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.874
Okay, well,
are you gonna look for something else around here?

36:50.876 --> 36:53.443
Or were you gonna go back to
the city once the pool closes?

36:53.445 --> 36:55.845
- I have no idea.
- Okay.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.814
That's... Good.
Good.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.918
Ah, no. No, thanks.
I will pass on that.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.987
Uh, leigh, evidently,
will not.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.757
Can you just keep...
Drinking your beer? Yeah.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.527
Let's try and have fun.
I know that it's weird, whatever.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.729
But... Let's just try
and have a good time.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.232
[Laughs]
Okay.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.867
[John] I can't believe it's not developed yet.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.536
It's a park, john.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.805
Nature.
It's "pra-served."

37:21.807 --> 37:23.907
We used to come
when we were little.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.810
Remember leigh had all these plans
about getting married under the arbor?

37:26.812 --> 37:28.912
I'm thinking
it's water table issues.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.514
Otherwise the city would've developed
the shit out of this place by now.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.518
[Stammers] What does this remind me of, mel?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.654
It's like, uh,
<i>great expectations. Right?</i>

37:37.656 --> 37:42.425
Remember that?
It's all overgrown and old and everything.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.263
[Todd]
No way.

37:46.265 --> 37:49.432
This is a piece of chandelier.
This is a crystal.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.268
It's original.
I just found it. Bullshit.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.404
That's probably a hypodermic needle.
Let me see it. No!

37:54.406 --> 37:58.275
[Leigh] 'Cause better classes now at,
you know, a better college.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.343
I don't wanna go
to college.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.779
Okay.
What do you want?

38:04.015 --> 38:05.715
I don't know.
Something cool.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.984
Something...
Outside.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.988
Wh-what does that mea--
[Clears throat]

38:11.990 --> 38:15.558
You have to be specific.
You can't just drift.

38:20.598 --> 38:22.432
What?

38:25.036 --> 38:27.070
You seem really sad.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.662
Well, it's just leigh never seemed like
the kind of person that would be lost.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.431
You know?

38:54.433 --> 38:55.965
Me, on the other hand--

38:55.967 --> 38:59.336
yeah, well, you know,
real life can be disappointing...

38:59.338 --> 39:01.471
When your expectations
are so high.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.341
[Spits]

39:04.343 --> 39:06.476
I have high expectations.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.913
You know what
I'm talking about.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.748
Everybody does.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.953
Well, whatever.

39:18.456 --> 39:18.755
Excuse me.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.963
I'm not gonna hang out
with those kids anymore. Okay?

39:26.965 --> 39:28.665
Why not?

39:28.667 --> 39:31.101
We didn't smoke weed.
[Chuckles]

39:31.103 --> 39:33.036
Seriously, mel?

39:33.038 --> 39:34.971
I mean--
[Scoffs]

39:34.973 --> 39:36.973
Leigh is being a fucking idiot.
Okay?

39:36.975 --> 39:39.709
I mean, todd wants to,
like, rape those kids.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.511
Hey. Hey.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.480
You can't say that.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.619
Look, I just wanna hang out with adults.
Okay?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.421
Is that too much
to ask?

39:52.423 --> 39:53.890
Great.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.393
"Great"?
[Chuckles]

39:56.395 --> 39:59.095
Fine!
Fine. It's fine.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.557
What are you
doing?

40:32.563 --> 40:34.697
Slap my face...

40:34.699 --> 40:36.566
With your dick.

40:47.845 --> 40:51.815
Wh--
what's wrong with you?

40:56.987 --> 40:59.222
Hey. Hey.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.724
Hey, hey, hey, baby.
Hey.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.460
I love you.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.595
Okay?
I love you.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.064
Hey.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.767
It's okay.

41:25.217 --> 41:27.217
<i>[Tv clicks on,</i>
<i>indistinct]</i>

41:35.125 --> 41:37.894
I did a story about a guy who
kept a tiger in his apartment...

41:37.896 --> 41:40.230
In the city.

41:40.232 --> 41:42.632
The tiger got sick and died.

41:43.767 --> 41:47.070
[Chuckles]
Well, that'd be cool. Right?

41:47.072 --> 41:49.839
To have a tiger
as a pet.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.942
And fuckin' invite everybody you hate to the house.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.648
What?

What?

42:02.687 --> 42:04.687
It's not cool.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.189
It's sad.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.057
It's incredibly sad.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.996
This creature was kept...

42:12.998 --> 42:14.898
Against its will...

42:14.900 --> 42:17.834
In a totally unnatural
environment for it.

42:19.103 --> 42:21.304
And it was kept
in, like, a cell...

42:21.306 --> 42:22.939
In someone's apartment...

42:22.941 --> 42:24.607
For their amusement.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.646
But it was cruel,
and it killed it.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.950

this amazing thing that--

42:35.886 --> 42:37.287
that should have been
running free...

42:37.289 --> 42:39.656
And kept it prisoner.

42:43.594 --> 42:45.094
And it died.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.332
And it was just--

42:51.635 --> 42:53.636
it wasn't even full grown.

42:55.973 --> 42:58.174
Well, maybe,

42:58.176 --> 43:00.743
'cause you wrote
the article,

43:00.745 --> 43:02.245
you know--

43:03.847 --> 43:06.583
um, I-if somebody
had an animal...

43:06.585 --> 43:10.787
And they weren't
treating it right,

43:10.789 --> 43:14.324
they would read your article
and-- and... Change their minds.

43:18.028 --> 43:20.063
Yeah.

43:20.065 --> 43:21.798
Maybe.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.143

Nothing.

49:22.225 --> 49:22.224

you're staying here...

49:22.226 --> 49:28.331
Doesn't mean you can take advantage of
your father and I and pretend this is a hotel.

In the summers,
when I was really little,

53:16.761 --> 53:20.563
we'd go up to my mom's friend's,
up in Vermont.

a... Cabin.

in the lake.

throw 'em back.

Um, 2003,
I think--

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.930
I wanna say.

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:57.165
So yeah,
like nine years.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:04.039
Shit, my dad could do this
in, like, two months.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.875
They want
to do it themselves.

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.077
It's like a...

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:15.951

Yeah?

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:21.323
Well, they didn't.
[Laughs] I know.

I know.
[Groans]

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.927
It's so embarrassing.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.230
It's like--
how hard is it...

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:31.600
To just move forward and--

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:42.444
leigh.

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:45.080

you weren't the raccoons.

Oh, no. Are you still up
because of me?

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:13.608
[Justine] We started that addition
when you went off to college.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.211
You know, I made
your dad do it.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:19.247
I made him go
to home depot.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.017
I made him do
the plans with me...

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:24.319
So we would have...

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:28.223
Something together.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:32.193
You know how that worked out.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.230
But it's not funny, leigh.

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.466
And it's not yours--

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:41.603
it's not yours
to be embarrassed about.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.471
I--

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:46.174
I need you to move out. Now.

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:47.976
Are you serious?

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:51.046
Mom, I'm sorry that I was snarky about the addition--

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:53.214
has it ever
occurred to you...

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.650
That I might be working
on <i>my</i> life?

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:57.419
Hmm?

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:59.554
We both can't be doing that
at the same time?

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:01.656
Oh, is that
what you're doing?

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.161
Yes.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.397
You know, I'm al--

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:13.335
I'm allowed
to, um, be confused...

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:16.171
And stumble
once in a while.

01:06:16.173 --> 01:06:19.474
Okay? I've never done that up until this point.
Okay? Never.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.477
Let me tell you something.
I've always been 100 %--

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.746
your father
would be so happy...

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:29.117
To keep you
as a baby forever.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.252
But it's different
for the mother.

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:36.024
Now, I know you don't know
what that means yet, but--

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:40.195
you know that you were
the solar eclipse of my life?

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:42.063
That's what I wanted.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:45.066
I hung on
your every breath...

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.369
Until--
well, until recently,

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:50.138
and I-- I just can't--
I'm not--

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.074
I can't go back
in time with you.

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:55.477

You have to go.

I think so.

And hasn't been back.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.443
Why did he go without you?

At the fields,
I told him I wanted more time.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.687
You know, so--
I don't know.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.560
Maybe he's
feeling it out up there.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:30.331

Getting the jobs lined up.

Well, she's there with him.

What do you mean,
she was there with it?

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:30.004
She wasn't there when it happened.
She was probably at the pool.
