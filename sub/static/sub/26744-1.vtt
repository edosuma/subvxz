01:06.842 --> 01:09.175
- Tell me something Scholar?

01:10.373 --> 01:12.790
What is it about doing drugs?

01:18.012 --> 01:19.668
- It's the rappers man.

01:19.668 --> 01:20.574
- Rappers?

01:20.574 --> 01:23.407
- But in the drug addicts' defense,

01:24.902 --> 01:27.619
the other day I heard like four songs

01:27.619 --> 01:32.619
on the radio about how good
sex is when you're high.

01:32.716 --> 01:35.209
So I started to wonder,

01:35.209 --> 01:38.493
what would sex be like if I was high

01:38.493 --> 01:40.576
and I have these powers.

01:42.452 --> 01:44.226
That would be hard to
defuse such programming

01:44.226 --> 01:46.326
for a mere mortal such as yourself.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.155
- Mere mortal such as myself?

01:50.213 --> 01:52.305
Mere mortal such as myself?

01:52.554 --> 01:54.850
Mere mortal such as myself?

01:55.625 --> 01:57.875
Mere mortal such as myself?

01:58.392 --> 02:01.308
Mere mortal such as myself?

02:01.525 --> 02:04.495
Mere mortal such as ...stop doing that.

02:06.529 --> 02:07.748
- Yo, I almost had you man.

02:07.748 --> 02:09.973
You getting stronger.

02:09.973 --> 02:11.690
Before, I used to be able to hold you

02:11.690 --> 02:12.705
for as long as I wanted.

02:12.705 --> 02:16.190
Now I only got you for
a couple of seconds.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.867
- Well, I been working hard to shield

02:17.867 --> 02:19.917
myself from such attacks.

02:20.692 --> 02:25.692
Sooner or later you won't be
able to do it at all, trust me.

02:30.589 --> 02:33.696
Anyway, why do you need me tonight?

02:33.696 --> 02:35.724
Can't you just mind zap these dudes

02:35.724 --> 02:37.854
and make 'em go to jail?

02:39.329 --> 02:41.246
- Yeah I could do that.

02:41.835 --> 02:42.668
But,

02:44.101 --> 02:46.684
I figured Stallion, he's down there

02:48.612 --> 02:50.988
and you want pay back for Gabriel.

02:50.988 --> 02:51.905
- Stallion.

03:08.072 --> 03:10.155
- I am not afraid to die.

03:15.182 --> 03:16.015
- Really.

03:18.775 --> 03:22.442
- Yeah, and plus I could use the exercise.

03:23.869 --> 03:28.869
Time to put shoes to dudes.

03:29.077 --> 03:30.910
- What about the guns?

03:32.033 --> 03:36.982
- You worry 'bout Stallion,
I worry about the guns.

03:36.982 --> 03:39.479
If anyone decides they want to use 'em,

03:39.479 --> 03:42.979
they gonna have a mind blowing experience.

03:44.610 --> 03:47.527
Trust me.

05:07.213 --> 05:08.889
- Stallion!

06:21.333 --> 06:22.600
- Fuck!

06:26.821 --> 06:30.049
Listen, these motherfuckers
raided the warehouse.

06:30.049 --> 06:31.079
But that bird in your air,

06:31.079 --> 06:32.826
and use my cellphone to find me.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.069
- Get up!

07:53.902 --> 07:58.652
- No matter what you do, you
can't bring that bitch back.

08:07.583 --> 08:11.166
- What the
fuck did you do, fuck!

08:14.056 --> 08:15.681
- It doesn't matter.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.289
It's done.

08:19.388 --> 08:21.548
- Damn, he killed him?

08:22.756 --> 08:25.331
Yo, I thought Thrill had a code son.

08:25.556 --> 08:28.386
Son, you got to tell me
what happens next bro.

08:28.386 --> 08:29.451
- Ray, you watching the bootleg

08:29.451 --> 08:31.823
of the whole series just
wait and see what happens.

08:31.823 --> 08:33.154
- Dawg look around man.

08:33.154 --> 08:35.821
I get clients all day and it just started.

08:35.821 --> 08:38.465
You think I got time to sit
here and watch a whole series?

08:38.465 --> 08:41.039
Come on yo, tell me what's up man.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.695
Come on man, tell me what's good.

08:42.695 --> 08:43.741
- I can't tell you.

08:59.042 --> 09:01.209
- Hey, are we next?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.360
- Yeah.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.780
- Yo, I am in the wrong business.

09:16.780 --> 09:21.297
- Listen here, and take
it from me my brother.

09:21.297 --> 09:23.078
No you're not.

09:23.078 --> 09:25.204
I only know her because of you.

09:25.204 --> 09:27.073
She not in here dressed
for me looking like that.

09:27.073 --> 09:28.691
- Yeah, all right.

09:28.691 --> 09:30.820
Look man I gotta go.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.099
You know my girl crazy.

09:32.099 --> 09:34.707
I don't even have time to
breathe, let along cheat.

09:35.557 --> 09:36.724
All right Ray.

09:37.062 --> 09:38.247
- All right bro.

09:38.247 --> 09:39.410
- Good looking out man.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.635
- Thank you.

09:40.635 --> 09:41.665
- All right, next time.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.670
- Oh let me run, Joel is coming in now.

10:15.663 --> 10:16.754
- Fresh and ready for tonight babe.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.213
- I'm happy you're ready.

10:20.883 --> 10:22.262
- What's up?

10:22.262 --> 10:24.859
- Jessie asked if you
could bring the full series

10:24.859 --> 10:26.625
over so we can watch all the episodes?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.531
- Oh come on Kathy, you're killing me.

10:28.531 --> 10:29.750
Are you serious?

10:29.750 --> 10:31.161
You are serious.

10:31.161 --> 10:32.995
Look the studio has a strict policy

10:32.995 --> 10:34.382
on this, you know that right?

10:34.382 --> 10:35.337
- Mm-hmm.

10:35.337 --> 10:36.634
- I'ma dead man if
someone tweets the ending.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.185
- Baby come on.

10:38.227 --> 10:39.491
- No I can't do it.

10:39.491 --> 10:40.449
- Please.

10:40.449 --> 10:41.366
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

10:41.366 --> 10:43.021
What are you?

10:43.021 --> 10:45.021
- What the hell is this?

10:47.150 --> 10:47.983
- Look I--

10:48.422 --> 10:49.717
- Who's hair is this?

10:49.717 --> 10:50.817
- I mean I don't know.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.470
Just calm down for a second.

10:52.470 --> 10:53.715
- I asked you a question Joel.

10:53.715 --> 10:55.031
Who's hair is this?

10:55.031 --> 10:56.040
- Can I speak?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.457
Look I don't have a clue
where that hair came from.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.290
- I thought you were
going to the barbershop.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.123
- I did go to the barbershop.

10:59.123 --> 11:00.464
- And now you're fucking around again?

11:00.464 --> 11:03.119
- Come on, I'm not fucking around Kathy.

11:03.402 --> 11:05.169
Babe, are you listening to me?

11:05.169 --> 11:07.912
- I thought we were
passed this bullshit Joel.

11:07.912 --> 11:10.268
- Kathy we are passed the bullshit.

11:10.268 --> 11:12.633
- So you still out here fucking
around and not only fucking

11:12.633 --> 11:14.228
around, you being sloppy with it too?

11:14.228 --> 11:15.225
- I'm not fucking around.

11:15.225 --> 11:18.983
Baby please, I promise
you, I did not cheat on you

11:18.983 --> 11:21.431
God, you keep bringing up
this stuff from the past

11:21.431 --> 11:23.126
and this shit happened
like five years ago.

11:23.126 --> 11:25.171
- Joel get outta my face.

11:25.171 --> 11:26.688
- Like how long you expect
me to deal with that?

11:26.688 --> 11:28.382
- Get out of my face okay,
I don't want to see you.

11:30.305 --> 11:31.368
- Get out your face,
well what about tonight?

11:31.368 --> 11:33.009
- Fuck tonight, I don't
want you around me.

11:33.009 --> 11:35.184
- It took me three
weeks to get those--

11:35.184 --> 11:37.848
- Shh, Kathy Peterson speaking.

11:37.848 --> 11:39.431
- Kathy, it's Ryan.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.632
How are you doing?

11:41.632 --> 11:42.923
- I am doing well Ryan.

11:42.923 --> 11:45.515
What can I do for you
on this fine Saturday.

11:45.515 --> 11:48.630
- Hey listen, I know it's
Saturday, but I'm gonna

11:48.630 --> 11:51.460
have to ask you to come in
and handle the Joshua file.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.761
- No problem Ryan, but, I do
have plans for this evening.

11:55.761 --> 11:57.743
Are you sure it can't
wait until Monday morning?

11:57.743 --> 12:00.964
- Unfortunately, it cannot wait Kathy.

12:00.964 --> 12:02.276
I have a meeting with Michael first

12:02.276 --> 12:04.060
thing Monday morning
to go over the figures.

12:04.060 --> 12:06.369
- Okay tomorrow, what about tomorrow?

12:06.369 --> 12:09.901
It's Sunday, I can come in and work then.

12:09.901 --> 12:12.244
- Kathy, I was under the impression

12:12.244 --> 12:16.832
you really wanted this
promotion and you'd be willing

12:16.832 --> 12:18.811
to do whatever it takes
in order to get it.

12:18.811 --> 12:20.978
Now is one of those times.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.382
- You are right, I will be right in.

12:26.123 --> 12:26.956
- Thanks.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.212
- Are you okay, what happened?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.320
- Don't worry about what happened.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.270
I just need you gone right now okay.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.803
And do not speak just leave.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.636
- Why I gotta leave if
you about to go to work?

12:43.870 --> 12:44.703
- Joel!

12:45.003 --> 12:45.836
Go, now!

12:48.212 --> 12:50.295
- Okay, you win, I'ma go.

12:53.955 --> 12:56.417
If that's what you really want.

12:57.042 --> 12:57.875
Damn.

13:04.862 --> 13:05.769
- Yo!

13:05.769 --> 13:06.664
- What's up man?

13:06.664 --> 13:07.886
- What up snitches?

13:07.886 --> 13:10.103
Hey guess who'll be at the fight tonight?

13:10.103 --> 13:11.524
- I know not you.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.374
- Oh you know wrong.

13:13.374 --> 13:15.196
I'll be there at 7:00 p.m.

13:15.196 --> 13:18.270
- Really, how the hell did you do that?

13:18.270 --> 13:21.532
- I got one of my subs to come in

13:21.532 --> 13:23.908
by telling her she was getting a promotion

13:23.908 --> 13:25.708
that she was never gonna
get in the first place.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.619
- And that worked?

13:27.619 --> 13:28.924
She fell for that?

13:28.924 --> 13:30.839
- Yeah of course it worked, what do

13:30.839 --> 13:32.299
you think I'm doing over here.

13:32.299 --> 13:33.321
You know what when she gets here,

13:33.321 --> 13:34.296
I'll give her some of my own work,

13:34.296 --> 13:35.428
you know what I mean?

13:35.428 --> 13:36.959
- Nice, all right.

13:36.959 --> 13:38.668
What about the other thing though?

13:38.668 --> 13:40.085
Did you get that?

13:41.683 --> 13:43.590
- Yeah I got it.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.551
I have it with me here in the office.

13:45.551 --> 13:48.575
- Ooh, you have it at the office with you.

13:48.575 --> 13:50.267
When did you get it?

13:50.267 --> 13:52.089
- I got it this morning,
I didn't have a chance

13:52.089 --> 13:54.695
to bring it home with me,
which is why I have it here.

13:54.695 --> 13:56.625
Don't make a big deal about it, all right?

13:56.625 --> 14:00.383
And listen, rest assured
what happened with

14:00.383 --> 14:02.541
that black fuck last month...

14:02.541 --> 14:04.694
will never happen again.

14:04.694 --> 14:08.094
Anyway let me go, I'll see you lames

14:08.094 --> 14:11.261
at the fight all right, don't be late.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.347
Hello.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.983
- Hey Ryan, this is Detective
Clayton, how are you?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.816
- Detective, I'm well.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.985
I'll be doing a hell of
lot better if I finally

14:47.985 --> 14:50.337
had some info on the man who attacked me.

14:50.337 --> 14:53.078
But other than that how are you doing?

14:53.078 --> 14:54.896
- I'm doing fine, thanks for asking.

14:54.896 --> 14:56.716
I'm actually calling
you about your assault.

14:56.716 --> 14:59.481
Unfortunately, we have to
close this investigation.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.547
We only have the description
of the individual you gave us

15:02.547 --> 15:04.382
and we haven't been able to locate anyone.

15:04.382 --> 15:06.830
Plus, the bartender said you were drunk

15:06.830 --> 15:09.782
and taunting the man because
he was talking to a woman

15:09.782 --> 15:11.692
that turned you down earlier that evening.

15:11.692 --> 15:12.700
Is that true?

15:12.700 --> 15:16.033
- It was late, I had a couple of drinks.

15:16.892 --> 15:19.214
Certainly, no enough to be drunk.

15:19.214 --> 15:22.761
And I have no absolutely no recollection

15:22.761 --> 15:24.776
of any woman turning me down.

15:24.776 --> 15:26.721
But what I do recall is being

15:26.721 --> 15:28.358
viciously attacked by a black man.

15:28.358 --> 15:31.113
- I understand, look if I hear anything

15:31.113 --> 15:35.101
from here on out, I'll let
you know okay, thank you.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.342
- Thank you Detective, you've
been an absolute great help.

15:45.359 --> 15:46.192
- My home.
- Amen.

15:46.251 --> 15:47.092
- My home.
- Amen.

15:52.363 --> 15:53.712
- This is Terry.

15:53.712 --> 15:55.060
- Hey frat what's good?

15:55.060 --> 15:56.500
- Hey nothing much, how are you?

15:56.500 --> 15:58.608
- All is well with me, but you know

15:58.608 --> 16:00.371
that issue you wanted me to look into?

16:00.371 --> 16:01.309
- Yep.

16:01.309 --> 16:03.307
- Well it's been taken care of.

16:03.307 --> 16:05.342
Tell your client he has
nothing to worry about.

16:05.342 --> 16:06.563
- So we're good?

16:06.563 --> 16:08.616
- We okay, how we good...

16:08.616 --> 16:11.443
is you get Joel to come
over here in a three weeks

16:11.443 --> 16:12.700
to this party and act like we boys

16:12.700 --> 16:14.323
so I can finally smash his chick.

16:14.323 --> 16:16.353
- Man you know you bigger than this right?

16:16.353 --> 16:18.889
- Come on Terry, you don't
think I know this is lame?

16:18.889 --> 16:21.611
I know it's lame, but not
lamer than your client

16:21.611 --> 16:23.552
going down for beating up
that drunk ass white boy.

16:23.552 --> 16:25.948
Look, I'm kidding, but I ain't kidding.

16:25.948 --> 16:28.573
You got three weeks to this
party, more then enough

16:28.573 --> 16:30.711
time to get this guy on board, all right.

16:30.711 --> 16:33.376
I gotta go, I'll talk to you.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.979
- I'm 163rd and Webster,

16:52.979 --> 16:53.992
what you know about that?

16:53.992 --> 16:55.173
- I know
everything about that.

16:55.173 --> 16:56.363
- You don't know nothing 'bout that life.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.261
- You already know.

16:57.261 --> 16:58.196
- You know about collecting those bottles?

16:58.196 --> 16:59.099
- Uh-huh.

16:59.099 --> 16:59.996
- Blue, green, and yellow.

17:48.349 --> 17:49.844
- Do you see him?

17:49.844 --> 17:50.692
- I do.

17:50.692 --> 17:52.015
- All right cool.

17:52.015 --> 17:53.471
Do you see the mark though?

17:53.471 --> 17:55.972
- No I can't, he has on all black.

17:55.972 --> 17:57.673
- Well go in there and get him.

17:57.673 --> 18:00.047
- Not yet, I want to
see how this plays out.

18:00.047 --> 18:02.538
- Never mind,
I'll make you do it myself.

18:04.114 --> 18:06.009
- Sorry bro, those days are long gone.

18:06.009 --> 18:08.817
I've mastered keeping you out of my mind.

18:08.817 --> 18:10.209
Fuck!

18:10.209 --> 18:12.105
Look have some patience.

18:12.153 --> 18:15.512
I want to see what we're dealing with.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.633
- You sure?

18:16.633 --> 18:17.466
Yeah.

18:58.532 --> 18:59.689
- One of the things
about smoking weed is that

18:59.689 --> 19:02.089
you have questions that
keep you up late at night.

19:02.089 --> 19:04.591
Like for instance this one question I had

19:04.591 --> 19:06.511
like three weeks ago, kept me up forever.

19:06.511 --> 19:09.428
And it was can a Crip donate blood?

19:12.612 --> 19:14.671
Like I honestly, I almost
went insane over that.

19:14.671 --> 19:19.151
But yeah, like I said,
it's great doing comedy.

19:19.151 --> 19:22.451
I just get to say whatever I
want and still get paid for it.

19:22.451 --> 19:25.087
Anyway my name is Kyle,
thanks for having me.

19:32.052 --> 19:35.032
- All right everybody, one
more time for Kyle Thompson!

19:37.628 --> 19:39.313
All right, I'm your host Khalia Solano

19:39.313 --> 19:41.553
and I've got one more comedian for you,

19:41.553 --> 19:43.532
Marlon John Baptiste.

19:47.884 --> 19:50.011
- How's everybody doing?

19:50.011 --> 19:51.431
All right I love being on stage

19:51.431 --> 19:53.431
and this the only time
you guys look up at me,

19:53.431 --> 19:55.033
when I have a conversation with y'all.

19:56.935 --> 19:58.172
I got a wife and four daughters.

19:58.172 --> 20:00.375
It's hard living with five females

20:00.375 --> 20:02.332
right, 'cause every now and
then you have feminine moments.

20:02.332 --> 20:05.713
Like I give you a perfect example.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.333
I be in the house watching Glee,

20:07.333 --> 20:10.615
like that's my shit right
there, you know what I'm saying.

20:10.615 --> 20:12.471
My wife come home and start talking to me,

20:12.471 --> 20:13.809
you know what I'm saying.

20:13.809 --> 20:14.990
This can't wait 'til
after the performances,

20:14.990 --> 20:15.987
that's my shit right there.

20:17.148 --> 20:18.631
I had the biggest feminine
moment over the summer though,

20:18.631 --> 20:20.471
regarding the heatwave
you know what I mean.

20:20.471 --> 20:22.069
I'm doing laundry and it's six of us.

20:22.069 --> 20:24.311
I'm small, homeboy see me, he's like,

20:24.311 --> 20:25.831
"Yo, you look like you need some help."

20:25.831 --> 20:27.031
I'm like, "I appreciate that."

20:27.031 --> 20:29.031
Feminine moment kicked in.

20:30.171 --> 20:33.153
I started flirting with him by mistake.

20:35.313 --> 20:36.513
Listen I didn't mean to
do it, don't judge me

20:36.513 --> 20:38.013
you know what I'm saying,
it was just in the moment

20:38.013 --> 20:38.943
you know what I mean.

20:38.943 --> 20:40.754
Like it just happened,
you know what I'm saying.

20:40.754 --> 20:42.156
So he's carrying the
shit upstairs, I'm like,

20:42.156 --> 20:43.950
"Yo, you look like you need a snow cone,

20:43.950 --> 20:46.135
"my kids got a snow
cone machine upstairs."

20:46.135 --> 20:48.153
I went upstairs made him a snow cone.

20:48.153 --> 20:50.375
- Hey what can we get for you?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.713
- White wine please.

20:51.713 --> 20:53.132
- Got you.

20:58.845 --> 20:59.678
- Thanks.

20:59.678 --> 21:01.772
- But it
worked out, it worked out.

21:24.936 --> 21:26.686
- That's interesting.

21:29.391 --> 21:30.232
- What is?

21:30.882 --> 21:35.660
- That suit and tie combination.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.718
- So you're gonna roll in
here giving fashion advice

21:38.718 --> 21:41.397
before you even give me your name?

21:41.397 --> 21:44.097
That's, that's a hard
sell fake Joan Rivers.

21:44.381 --> 21:46.172
- Ooh, look at you...

21:46.180 --> 21:47.013
you're funny.

21:51.122 --> 21:52.455
My name is Zoey.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.193
So you meeting anyone?

21:55.193 --> 21:56.817
I've been here for a minute watching you,

21:56.817 --> 21:59.340
but I had to ask before I made my move.

21:59.340 --> 22:03.239
- That's funny because I
don't remember you coming in.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.097
I've been looking.

22:05.097 --> 22:07.764
But no, to answer your question,

22:08.636 --> 22:10.876
just sitting here having a drink.

22:10.876 --> 22:12.839
My name's Tyler.

22:12.839 --> 22:16.039
- Well Tyler, see I was in the cut,

22:16.039 --> 22:18.556
but it makes sense you'd be here

22:18.556 --> 22:23.056
all alone with that outfit.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.043
- You got jokes.

22:28.015 --> 22:30.895
Thank you for brightening my Monday.

22:30.895 --> 22:32.479
- You're welcome.

22:32.479 --> 22:36.217
But if this is cool for you on a Monday,

22:36.217 --> 22:39.134
imagine what we can do on a Friday.

22:43.593 --> 22:46.629
- I may have to take you up on that.

22:46.629 --> 22:49.691
- Who offered you a Friday?

22:49.691 --> 22:52.173
Sometimes a Monday's all you get.

22:52.648 --> 22:56.131
And sometimes you have to make
the most of your opportunity.

22:56.131 --> 22:58.889
When and if it comes.

26:03.268 --> 26:04.101
- You okay?

26:04.101 --> 26:05.434
- Yes love, I am.

26:08.022 --> 26:09.685
Can you hand me my shirt?

26:09.685 --> 26:12.768
- You, you're not gonna stay?

26:14.547 --> 26:16.130
- No baby, I can't.

29:05.022 --> 29:08.439
- Damn, just when I thought I had a home.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.321
- What the fuck?

30:30.860 --> 30:32.060
- Yo! My man...

30:32.060 --> 30:33.361
was giving you the business.

30:33.361 --> 30:35.361
Hold on, let me get a picture of this.

30:35.361 --> 30:36.806
Wait, wait, wait.

30:40.542 --> 30:43.459
- You think you so funny.

30:48.795 --> 30:49.878
Where is she?

30:52.241 --> 30:53.740
- Where is who?

30:53.740 --> 30:55.990
- Don't play games with me.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.762
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:58.762 --> 31:00.739
- You do know what I'm talking about.

31:00.739 --> 31:02.481
Her father is a congressman.

31:02.481 --> 31:04.898
She's been missing for weeks.

31:06.292 --> 31:09.459
- Like I said, I don't know that girl.

31:12.673 --> 31:14.652
- Chill man.

31:16.544 --> 31:17.735
Relax yo.

31:17.974 --> 31:20.391
It's a easier way to do this.

31:24.368 --> 31:26.169
Father forgive 'cause he's a good man.

31:26.169 --> 31:30.152
He just doesn't know
the error of his ways.

31:30.152 --> 31:32.073
- Are you serious? This piece of shit?

31:32.073 --> 31:35.073
A good man, you're praying over him.

31:38.373 --> 31:40.289
- I wasn't praying for him,

31:40.289 --> 31:42.122
I was praying for you.

31:44.542 --> 31:47.420
You have to learn to be patient yo.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.969
A black man's reaction to everything

31:49.969 --> 31:52.050
doesn't always have to aggression.

31:52.050 --> 31:53.459
- This coming from a
dude that just beat up

31:53.459 --> 31:55.383
15 guys at a drug bust.

31:55.383 --> 31:56.903
- Yo, why you
bring up old shit man?

31:56.903 --> 31:58.069
- I'm bringing up old shit.

31:58.069 --> 32:00.652
- Anyway, she's here.

32:01.929 --> 32:04.012
He has here hidden there.

32:05.082 --> 32:09.082
Don't be rude, introduce
yourself to Mr. Thrill.

32:12.362 --> 32:14.810
- Hello
Mr. Thrill, my name is Shift.

32:14.810 --> 32:18.060
That's because I can shift into anyone.

32:20.889 --> 32:22.490
- Are you doing this?

32:22.490 --> 32:24.130
- That's dope
right, you like that?

32:24.130 --> 32:26.069
Now give him Nigerian.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.966
- Hello,
how are you my friend.

32:29.726 --> 32:32.552
- You think you clever?

32:32.552 --> 32:34.114
- All right, all right, stop.

32:34.114 --> 32:35.949
Go back to normal.

32:35.949 --> 32:37.853
- Why'd you kidnap the girl?

32:37.853 --> 32:41.875
- Well I move around a lot, and when I do

32:41.875 --> 32:43.434
I need someone to talk to.

32:43.434 --> 32:46.373
But, I take great care of them usually.

32:46.373 --> 32:49.872
But, they have to be
beautiful because I use their

32:49.872 --> 32:54.122
appearance to seduce
individuals I find attractive.

33:07.132 --> 33:09.049
- Is that it, the mark?

33:10.728 --> 33:11.594
- Is that what?

33:11.594 --> 33:12.427
What this?

33:13.466 --> 33:14.532
- Yeah.

33:14.532 --> 33:16.865
- I've just always had this.

33:19.572 --> 33:22.239
- Lead us to the girl.

34:17.219 --> 34:18.052
- You wolf!

34:18.052 --> 34:19.051
- Yo, yo, come
on yo, what the fuck

34:19.051 --> 34:20.599
is wrong with you man, relax.

34:20.599 --> 34:23.181
Relax yo, he's in the zone man,

34:24.496 --> 34:25.931
he doesn't know what's going on.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.100
Let him go!

34:27.100 --> 34:29.933
- Why did you keep me here!

34:31.337 --> 34:32.587
Why, answer me!

34:34.956 --> 34:37.947
Why, why did you keep me here, why!

35:09.685 --> 35:11.762
- Yo what's good Jerry, how's LA?

35:11.762 --> 35:13.377
- Yo man, LA is great.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.734
I'm telling you, you got to get out here.

35:15.734 --> 35:19.996
Hey listen, I know it's
Saturday and everything,

35:19.996 --> 35:22.156
but the studio just called and asked

35:22.156 --> 35:24.752
if you could come in and take
a couple of pick up shots.

35:24.752 --> 35:28.868
- No problem, I did have plans
today, but they've changed.

35:28.868 --> 35:30.535
So I'll be right in.

35:31.896 --> 35:34.616
Also, I want to talk to you
about some other roles Jerry.

35:34.616 --> 35:37.496
I don't want to be type cast
as this character anymore.

35:37.496 --> 35:39.332
I can do so much more.

35:39.332 --> 35:42.191
- Joel I know, trust me I'm on it.

35:42.191 --> 35:44.932
Can we deal with that after
you take the pick up shots?

35:44.932 --> 35:47.656
We'll have a little more
leverage than we do now

35:47.656 --> 35:49.197
if we just wait a little bit longer.

35:49.197 --> 35:52.697
- Of course, all right, talk to you later.

36:12.938 --> 36:13.771
- Cut!

36:17.933 --> 36:19.594
Cut!

36:19.594 --> 36:21.594
That's enough for today.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.930
Joel, can I see you over here please.

36:31.693 --> 36:33.133
You're costing us money today.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.252
- I know I'm sorry.

36:34.252 --> 36:35.410
- If you didn't have it, you
should have just said that.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.712
- You're right.

36:36.712 --> 36:38.550
- I need this shot bro.

36:38.550 --> 36:41.332
You see this, this doesn't allow us

36:41.332 --> 36:43.650
to send out mediocre footage.

36:43.650 --> 36:46.067
- You're right, you're right.

36:48.431 --> 36:50.013
Just dealing with some issues.

36:50.013 --> 36:51.263
- You see that,

36:54.113 --> 36:56.385
personal issues stop there.

36:56.385 --> 36:57.635
- Right.

37:03.539 --> 37:04.372
- Water?

37:04.372 --> 37:05.539
- Thank you.

37:05.539 --> 37:06.942
Do you mind getting my cell phone?

37:06.942 --> 37:08.109
- No.
- Thanks.

37:14.254 --> 37:15.523
Thanks.

37:15.523 --> 37:16.356
- Anytime.

37:29.555 --> 37:31.112
- Yo.

37:31.112 --> 37:33.452
- Fuck, I got issues.

37:33.452 --> 37:38.452
- In other news, lobsters,
they get boiled and turn red.

37:38.712 --> 37:40.312
Fuck happened now?

37:40.312 --> 37:41.832
- Yo, why you always got to try to be

37:41.832 --> 37:43.475
the smartest dude in the room Terry, huh?

37:43.475 --> 37:45.416
That shit is annoying.

37:45.416 --> 37:48.666
- Okay, Joel, how can I help my friend?

37:49.710 --> 37:51.256
What's the issue?

37:51.256 --> 37:54.423
Hang on, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

37:55.865 --> 37:57.509
All right bro talk to me.

37:57.509 --> 38:01.011
- I went to the barbershop
right to get a cut and when I

38:01.011 --> 38:03.166
came home, you know
Kathy goes in for a hug.

38:03.166 --> 38:05.032
And when she pulls away she finds

38:05.032 --> 38:06.734
a blond strand of hair on my sweater.

38:06.734 --> 38:10.392
- Damn man, how you get busted like that?

38:10.392 --> 38:12.195
- I never did anything.

38:12.195 --> 38:14.851
Every since I got caught with Sasha,

38:14.851 --> 38:16.595
I been on the up and up, so.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.072
- Come on man really?

38:18.072 --> 38:19.352
Joel, it's me really?

38:19.352 --> 38:21.555
- Motherfucker yes, really.

38:21.555 --> 38:24.094
Look the only person I lie to you

38:24.094 --> 38:26.083
in your family is your
mother when I tell her

38:26.083 --> 38:27.634
she's the only lady in my life all right?

38:27.634 --> 38:30.051
- That's actually pretty good,
nice timing, I like that.

38:30.051 --> 38:32.211
All right, so funny guy, you gone tell me

38:32.211 --> 38:34.174
why you called or am I gonna
have to hang up in your face?

38:34.174 --> 38:35.854
- Damn a brother can't call his boy?

38:35.854 --> 38:37.608
Damn I just called to check on you.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.955
You know maybe to see what
you got going on tonight.

38:39.955 --> 38:43.672
- I should have known, you're
using me, mm-hmm.

38:43.672 --> 38:45.251
- Yes I'm using you.

38:45.251 --> 38:46.768
What you think I called you so you

38:46.768 --> 38:48.194
can dazzle me with conversation?

38:48.194 --> 38:50.851
You're lucky I'm the only person

38:50.851 --> 38:52.371
on this planet that doesn't think

38:52.371 --> 38:54.174
you're an asshole and
still fucks with you.

38:54.174 --> 38:56.632
- All right funny man,
so you also are a lucky

38:56.632 --> 38:58.832
mofo because you know what, I got

38:58.832 --> 39:01.432
tickets to the fight tonight.

39:01.432 --> 39:05.075
Just happen to had one
that had your name on it,

39:05.075 --> 39:06.768
'til you brought my mom into this.

39:06.768 --> 39:08.872
- You see, I knew there was
a reason why I called you.

39:08.872 --> 39:10.515
Your brother gonna be there?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.734
- Yeah he'll be there, why
is that gonna be a problem?

39:12.734 --> 39:14.812
Don't tell me you guys still have

39:14.812 --> 39:16.094
that issue man, please come on.

39:16.094 --> 39:17.511
- No, not at all.

39:18.611 --> 39:20.354
Look I know he got a brand
new uppity negro job clerking

39:20.354 --> 39:22.691
and shit, so I didn't get a chance to

39:22.691 --> 39:24.408
congratulate him, so I'll do that tonight.

39:24.408 --> 39:26.568
Look I know you trying
to defend your brother,

39:26.568 --> 39:27.948
I'm just asking a question.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.571
- Look, you just have your ass

39:29.571 --> 39:30.968
here by 6:30 tonight all right.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.301
- 6:30, all right cool.

40:46.108 --> 40:47.283
- How much?

40:47.283 --> 40:48.116
- $3.

40:54.748 --> 40:56.350
Are you a cop?

40:56.350 --> 40:57.350
- Not a cop.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.344
- Why do you need that?

41:00.344 --> 41:02.568
- Well we all go to protect ourselves.

41:02.568 --> 41:05.406
What you don't got something back there?

41:05.406 --> 41:08.906
Know your rights old man, keep the change.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.488
- How's it going?

41:38.488 --> 41:39.507
- I'm all right, how you doing?

41:39.507 --> 41:40.790
- Yeah, yeah, good to see
you man, how's business?

41:40.790 --> 41:42.457
- It's good.

42:06.994 --> 42:08.661
- You sure it's him?

42:11.716 --> 42:13.133
- Yeah.

42:18.534 --> 42:21.375
- You expect me to talk
to you with that on?

42:21.375 --> 42:22.904
- What the hell man?

42:22.904 --> 42:23.999
- Is it him?

42:23.999 --> 42:27.182
- You think I want it to be him?

42:27.182 --> 42:30.862
Everything I read, all the research,

42:30.862 --> 42:33.195
shows that this is the mark.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.304
- You know I don't
believe in this shit man.

42:41.304 --> 42:43.079
- Come on, I'm not gonna
argue with you about

42:43.079 --> 42:43.912
the prophecy again.

42:43.912 --> 42:45.852
Either you gonna trust me
and we do this together,

42:45.852 --> 42:48.492
or I can do this shit by myself.

42:48.492 --> 42:51.430
Look we tried everything
and nothing worked,

42:51.430 --> 42:54.390
and they still out
there taking us out man.

42:54.390 --> 42:56.668
- I know, but who is it?

42:56.668 --> 42:59.388
You're stay in this Morpheous
and Neo shit and keep

42:59.388 --> 43:01.788
talking about if we unite
the twins they'll protect us.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.538
But what happens if we unite them

43:05.750 --> 43:08.688
and they decide to turn on us, huh?

43:08.688 --> 43:10.870
- It's only one way we find out right?

43:16.188 --> 43:18.938
- You have the other twin, right?

43:23.611 --> 43:24.944
- You know I do.

43:28.884 --> 43:30.894
- I can't read your mind
but if you don't tell me,

43:30.894 --> 43:32.461
I'm gonna beat it out of you.

43:32.461 --> 43:35.878
- Yo stop acting like
you my big brother man.

43:35.878 --> 43:39.961
And stop sleeping on me
like I'm some easy vic B.

43:45.093 --> 43:46.751
Yo I gotta keep this to myself

43:46.751 --> 43:48.256
just in case something goes left.

43:48.256 --> 43:51.998
They're other mind readers out
there more powerful than me.

43:51.998 --> 43:54.137
And I got to make sure everything is cool

43:54.137 --> 43:56.220
until they come together.

43:57.718 --> 44:00.393
- So at what point are one of you morons

44:00.393 --> 44:02.435
gonna tell me what the fuck is going on

44:02.435 --> 44:04.412
or just take me to Solomon.

44:04.412 --> 44:08.392
- Solomon, Solomon is too good for you.

44:08.392 --> 44:12.572
No prison on earth needs
a man like you in it.

44:12.572 --> 44:15.176
And trust me, if my
little brother didn't find

44:15.176 --> 44:18.762
that birthmark, you
wouldn't be here today.

44:18.762 --> 44:20.848
There's a lot of rich
men that wants your head

44:20.848 --> 44:22.451
separated from your body boy.

44:22.451 --> 44:25.672
- I'm telling you man, keep it up.

44:25.672 --> 44:27.395
I swear I'm a fuck--

44:27.395 --> 44:30.130
- You gonna fuck me,
what did you just say?

44:30.130 --> 44:31.752
I know you just didn't
say you gonna fuck me.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.585
There you go with the jokes again.

44:32.585 --> 44:33.418
I don't get down like that Scholar.

44:33.418 --> 44:34.512
- If you let me finish
what I was about to say,

44:34.512 --> 44:36.592
I said I was about to fuck you up man.

44:36.592 --> 44:39.106
- I'd like to see you try.

44:39.106 --> 44:41.750
- Do you mind finishing
your Abbot and Costello

44:41.750 --> 44:45.417
routine so I can know
my history? Thank you.

44:47.414 --> 44:48.747
Please continue.

44:54.669 --> 44:55.531
- The first known twins are born

44:55.531 --> 44:58.171
to Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.

44:58.171 --> 44:59.581
She was one of his slaves.

44:59.581 --> 45:01.168
Now the prophecy states that these twins

45:01.168 --> 45:03.306
are supposed to lead the oppressed

45:03.306 --> 45:05.723
to overthrow all governments.

45:07.666 --> 45:10.204
History tells us about
their son, Eston Hemings.

45:10.204 --> 45:13.328
But what it didn't tell us
about was the other twin,

45:13.328 --> 45:16.911
Nathaniel Turner, also
known as Nat Turner.

45:21.569 --> 45:24.150
Jefferson knew he couldn't
keep both of the kids

45:24.150 --> 45:26.390
so he let the mother decide
which one she wanted to keep.

45:26.390 --> 45:29.308
She chose Eston, and they sent Nat

45:29.308 --> 45:31.641
to a plantation in Virginia.

45:33.430 --> 45:34.529
- That doesn't make any sense.

45:35.754 --> 45:36.595
- What?

45:36.595 --> 45:39.932
- Everyone knows Turner was born in 1800

45:39.932 --> 45:42.492
and Eston was born in 1808, so there's no

45:42.492 --> 45:45.091
possible way they could be twins.

45:45.091 --> 45:46.993
- Why, because that's what
you been told or sold?

45:46.993 --> 45:50.076
Check this, they didn't keep a record

45:51.713 --> 45:53.692
of slave birthdays back then.

45:53.692 --> 45:55.830
So if they did, it was
for insurance purposes.

45:55.830 --> 45:59.254
So the recorded date doesn't mean

45:59.254 --> 46:02.549
it's the actual date, you dig?

46:02.549 --> 46:04.382
- Okay, I'm listening.

46:08.337 --> 46:10.792
- Eston, he had the same powers as Nat,

46:10.792 --> 46:12.614
but Nat's was activated sooner

46:12.614 --> 46:14.817
because of the stress of his condition.

46:14.817 --> 46:17.230
He started his rebellion because

46:17.230 --> 46:19.654
his force was making him want to fight,

46:19.654 --> 46:21.592
drawing him closer to his brother.

46:21.592 --> 46:24.577
But once the rebellion was
over, the owner snitched.

46:24.577 --> 46:27.073
He told some people that Eston and Nat

46:27.073 --> 46:29.414
were brothers, they knew that Jefferson

46:29.414 --> 46:31.196
fathered the boys, so they went

46:31.196 --> 46:34.694
to Jefferson's plantation
and castrated Eston.

46:34.694 --> 46:38.174
They didn't kill him out
of respect for Jefferson.

46:38.174 --> 46:42.507
After that night they started an alliance,

46:42.507 --> 46:44.590
making sure that no twins from

46:44.590 --> 46:46.840
that bloodline ever united.

46:47.789 --> 46:49.350
- Forever.

46:49.350 --> 46:51.630
- So Eston couldn't have babies.

46:51.630 --> 46:55.015
What people don't know is, Nat had twins

46:55.015 --> 46:58.531
before he was killed in 1831
at the age of 23 and not 30.

46:58.531 --> 47:01.651
The mother feared that they'd be hunted.

47:01.651 --> 47:03.848
So she separated them.

47:03.848 --> 47:08.348
Those twins were Harriet
Tubman and Frederick Douglas.

47:09.382 --> 47:12.288
Everybody thinks that Tubman and Douglas

47:12.288 --> 47:17.288
were all about freeing the
slaves but it just wasn't that.

47:17.467 --> 47:21.407
The same force was drawing
'em closer together.

47:21.407 --> 47:23.074
So they could unite.

47:24.507 --> 47:26.344
- I keep telling that man that's bullshit,

47:26.344 --> 47:29.088
because Douglas was half
black and half white.

47:29.088 --> 47:31.450
- So you're saying that because he

47:31.450 --> 47:33.328
taught himself how to read and write?

47:33.328 --> 47:35.186
And a black man back then couldn't

47:35.186 --> 47:37.885
possibly be genius because, what?

47:37.885 --> 47:39.302
Because he was black?

47:39.302 --> 47:41.803
So you justify his intelligence
by saying he's mixed

47:41.803 --> 47:46.803
with white and that's the
only way he could be smart.

47:46.987 --> 47:49.190
- When does this urge begin?

47:51.015 --> 47:52.848
- No one really knows.

47:54.006 --> 47:55.947
It's usually around the time the twins

47:55.947 --> 47:58.902
start to realize their full power.

47:58.902 --> 48:01.126
What people don't know is,
Frederick Douglas was killed

48:01.126 --> 48:03.626
and replaced with an imposter.

48:04.726 --> 48:07.824
That's why he married a white woman.

48:07.824 --> 48:09.842
- Okay, you didn't tell me this.

48:09.842 --> 48:14.642
Douglas was killed, an
imposter replaced him, what?

48:14.642 --> 48:19.144
- Yo check this Thrill,
there was no television

48:19.144 --> 48:21.120
and internet back then.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.777
The only source of
media was the newspaper.

48:23.777 --> 48:26.024
And everybody believed what
they put in the paper back then.

48:26.024 --> 48:28.344
Especially if they had a
picture attached to it.

48:28.344 --> 48:30.003
Well shit, they believe everything

48:30.003 --> 48:31.523
they put on the internet now.

48:31.523 --> 48:33.704
So imagine all you had
was some paper called

48:33.704 --> 48:36.120
the Daly Lantern or some shit like that.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.420
A matter of fact, FDR got
reelected for a third term

48:39.420 --> 48:42.563
without anybody knowing
that he was in a wheelchair.

48:42.563 --> 48:45.902
So finding some stock
photo of some mediocre

48:45.902 --> 48:49.422
negro and passing it off,
that's child's play man.

48:49.422 --> 48:51.799
- You think you so smart don't you?

48:51.799 --> 48:54.499
- You gonna let me finish?

48:56.432 --> 48:57.573
- You may.

48:58.318 --> 48:59.151
- Gracias.

49:00.339 --> 49:04.506
Anyway, Tubman, she had a boy and a girl.

49:04.506 --> 49:07.673
Madam C.J. Walker, and W.E.B. Du Bois.

49:09.662 --> 49:12.163
Because she was aware of the nature

49:12.163 --> 49:16.099
of white southerners back
then, she separated them.

49:16.099 --> 49:20.932
She sent Du Bois to Massachusetts
and Walker to Louisiana.

49:22.300 --> 49:25.699
When they got older they were
being drawn to one another.

49:25.699 --> 49:27.560
But then there was an
accident the night that

49:27.560 --> 49:31.043
they were supposed to
meet at an NAACP meeting.

49:31.518 --> 49:33.635
That's when shit gets...

49:33.651 --> 49:34.801
sticky.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.595
That night while Walker was experimenting

49:38.595 --> 49:41.902
with some chemicals,
there was an explosion.

49:41.902 --> 49:46.259
Chemicals blew up in her face
and mixed up with her blood.

49:46.259 --> 49:50.035
And after that she became the first twin

49:50.035 --> 49:52.802
with enhanced mutant powers.

49:52.802 --> 49:54.339
Because she felt like the whole situation

49:54.339 --> 49:57.459
was a setup, she cut off
her meeting with Du Bois

49:57.459 --> 50:02.209
and immediately became pregnant
in 1917 at the age of 49.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.483
And her twins are John F.
Kennedy and Lena Horne.

50:09.367 --> 50:11.338
Once she saw that Kennedy
came out looking white,

50:11.338 --> 50:13.880
she sent him to
Massachusetts where Du Bois

50:13.880 --> 50:15.742
scouted out the Kennedy family

50:15.742 --> 50:18.984
and he was raised there in Boston.

50:18.984 --> 50:22.083
Lena was sent to France
with the Horne family

50:22.083 --> 50:24.166
and she was raised there.

50:25.464 --> 50:26.464
- Holy shit.

50:28.222 --> 50:32.462
My great-great-grandmother was Lena Horne.

50:33.279 --> 50:34.604
- Word.

50:35.779 --> 50:38.187
Kennedy, he was
assassinated once his powers

50:38.187 --> 50:41.770
were activated due to the
stress of his presidency.

50:43.464 --> 50:46.104
And around that time, Lena
start to realize her powers

50:46.104 --> 50:48.937
and she was being drawn to him, but

50:52.462 --> 50:55.182
there haven't been any twins since.

50:57.274 --> 50:59.274
Not until you of course.

51:01.428 --> 51:03.678
So why are you really here?

51:04.573 --> 51:07.240
- I'm not sure man, I just came.

51:08.022 --> 51:11.323
I was watching TV and this force,

51:11.323 --> 51:15.490
almost like a child's
voice, just told me to come.

51:16.502 --> 51:19.963
I been here only a couple of months,

51:19.963 --> 51:22.527
though I had a home actually.

51:22.527 --> 51:26.777
- That's because your twin
is realizing his powers.

51:27.716 --> 51:30.384
We got to get out of here man.

51:30.384 --> 51:32.292
- Where is he?

51:39.538 --> 51:40.371
- Yo.

51:40.896 --> 51:41.803
- Yo.

51:41.803 --> 51:42.886
- What's good?

51:42.886 --> 51:44.383
- What do you mean what's good?

51:44.383 --> 51:46.822
Do you even talk like
that anymore Warbucks?

51:46.822 --> 51:48.371
- Please, every now and again I like

51:48.371 --> 51:49.403
to use the lingo of the peasants.

51:49.403 --> 51:50.236
- This guy.

51:50.236 --> 51:51.643
- So I don't forget where I came from.

51:52.235 --> 51:57.235
- So uh shit's fucked up now
like that with you and Kathy?

51:59.352 --> 52:00.769
- I think so man.

52:00.829 --> 52:04.950
- Damn man, she was with
you shooting in the gym too.

52:05.225 --> 52:06.058
- Uh-huh.

52:06.528 --> 52:10.824
- But what she's asking
you to do is fucked up?

52:10.824 --> 52:13.131
- Fucked up, why do you say that?

52:13.131 --> 52:14.470
- 'Cause what's the point to being famous,

52:14.470 --> 52:16.731
if you only get to smash one vagina

52:16.731 --> 52:18.630
for the rest of your life?

52:18.630 --> 52:20.710
Think about fam, I mean
women know you in Pakistan.

52:20.710 --> 52:22.248
- Why you doing that?

52:22.248 --> 52:23.787
- Doing what?

52:23.787 --> 52:25.408
- Doing that, putting
a battery in my back.

52:25.408 --> 52:27.472
Gassing me to not think about this shit.

52:27.472 --> 52:30.805
- Isn't that why you're here, to forget?

52:32.491 --> 52:34.470
Yeah, exactly King.

52:36.328 --> 52:38.495
- King, what's that about?

52:39.088 --> 52:41.910
- King because you are one.

52:41.910 --> 52:43.551
Look I got way too many connections

52:43.551 --> 52:45.368
to keep calling black men 'niggas'.

52:45.368 --> 52:47.510
So I been two weeks to call
every black man I see 'King'.

52:47.510 --> 52:50.490
But let me keep my thought here.

52:50.490 --> 52:54.491
How she gonna expect
you, a man who's known

52:54.491 --> 52:57.648
in places in the world where
they have no wi-fi connection,

52:57.648 --> 53:00.646
to be committed to her and only her?

53:00.646 --> 53:02.975
Again what's the point to being famous?

53:02.975 --> 53:06.515
You might as well be a regular dude.

53:06.515 --> 53:08.755
- Word, you right.

53:08.755 --> 53:13.475
You're right, I'm a freaking
superhero on a hit TV show.

53:13.475 --> 53:15.934
And I have to follow
regular dude treatment.

53:15.934 --> 53:19.532
She is selfish, plus I
didn't even do it this time.

53:19.532 --> 53:22.365
I might as well be a regular dude.

53:24.067 --> 53:25.467
Where's your brother,

53:25.467 --> 53:26.300
I don't want to be late to this game?

53:26.300 --> 53:27.658
- Hold on, I gotta get this.

53:27.658 --> 53:29.431
Hello, this is Terry.

53:29.431 --> 53:34.356
Yes, yes, that would be
an eminent domain case.

53:38.788 --> 53:41.325
Right, good old Manifest Destiny

53:41.325 --> 53:43.448
comes back to haunt us right?

53:43.448 --> 53:47.781
The square footage of the
property is 30 feet by 52.

53:55.225 --> 54:00.142
Yeah, so I'm just gonna let
you guide me on this one, okay.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.666
I mean I'm here for whatever, whenever.

54:03.666 --> 54:06.744
Don't be afraid to pick up that phone.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.494
All right, take care.

54:18.054 --> 54:18.971
Y'all good?

54:20.381 --> 54:22.714
- I mean I'm good, you good?

54:24.345 --> 54:26.095
- I'm good, you good?

54:29.646 --> 54:31.049
- Congrats on the new job.

54:31.049 --> 54:32.569
- Whatever man.

54:32.569 --> 54:36.069
- Y'all need to cut this out and let's go.

54:56.233 --> 54:58.526
- Yo Justin, why are you walking so close

54:58.526 --> 55:00.448
behind me like you George Zimmerman?

55:00.448 --> 55:02.031
- What, you scared?

55:03.246 --> 55:05.806
- Yo today is not the day man, I swear.

55:05.806 --> 55:07.993
All right, I just had some
stuff go down with Kathy,

55:07.993 --> 55:09.328
I'm not in the mood.

55:10.448 --> 55:11.934
Plus no one is scared of you.

55:11.934 --> 55:13.933
Yo look man, you got your job,

55:13.933 --> 55:16.276
and I need my face to act, so it's not

55:16.276 --> 55:18.473
like we gone start fighting
out here like it's UFC.

55:18.473 --> 55:22.692
Talk your shit out,
all right, talk it out.

55:22.692 --> 55:24.633
What the fuck is wrong with you man?

55:24.633 --> 55:25.934
- What's wrong with me?

55:25.934 --> 55:27.808
- Wait, wait, wait a minute man.

55:27.808 --> 55:29.993
Yo you still mad at me about Sasha?

55:29.993 --> 55:31.572
- Yeah I'm still mad.

55:31.572 --> 55:33.252
- Oh my god, you serious?

55:33.252 --> 55:34.654
- You stole her from me.

55:34.654 --> 55:35.956
- I, I stole her.

55:35.956 --> 55:37.054
- And then you want to act,
- I stole her?

55:37.054 --> 55:38.608
- like nothing ain't never happened.

55:38.608 --> 55:39.441
- I stole her from you?

55:39.441 --> 55:40.790
- Baby bro, baby bro, baby
bro, you can't steal a woman.

55:40.790 --> 55:42.652
It doesn't work like that man,
she chose Joel, come on man.

55:42.652 --> 55:45.654
Listen, listen, she's
not Solomon Northcutt,

55:45.654 --> 55:47.610
this is not 12 Years A Slave.

55:47.610 --> 55:48.870
- Man come on.

55:48.870 --> 55:49.910
- Yo forget you bro.

55:49.910 --> 55:51.534
- Forget me, hmm?

55:51.534 --> 55:53.411
The same guy who got you
out of that fight shit?

55:53.411 --> 55:55.094
- You're crazy right now.

55:55.094 --> 55:57.848
- Come on bro, let's
just get in the car okay?

55:57.848 --> 56:00.433
You and you, in the car.

56:00.433 --> 56:03.516
Please, please, let's get in the car.

56:04.534 --> 56:05.532
- Go on.

56:05.532 --> 56:07.254
- No, I'ma let you go.

56:07.254 --> 56:08.854
- I'm bugging.

56:08.854 --> 56:10.054
You stole her.

56:10.054 --> 56:11.779
And I'm riding shotgun.

56:39.473 --> 56:41.473
Justin, look man my bad.

56:42.854 --> 56:45.793
You know I apologize, I really

56:45.793 --> 56:47.324
had no idea you were dating her too.

56:47.324 --> 56:50.092
I've been meaning to talk to
you about this but I'm black.

56:50.092 --> 56:52.593
You know a nigga don't know

56:52.593 --> 56:53.894
how to express himself emotionally.

56:53.894 --> 56:55.574
- Come on fam, I told
you already all right.

56:55.574 --> 56:57.094
We don't talk like that in this car.

56:57.094 --> 56:59.094
We are not niggas in this
car, we are kings okay.

56:59.094 --> 57:00.614
- Okay.

57:00.614 --> 57:02.131
- You are a king, call yourself a king.

57:02.131 --> 57:04.033
- Okay Terry, king, king.

57:04.033 --> 57:05.190
Is that better?

57:05.190 --> 57:07.107
Anyways, I'm sorry man.

57:09.762 --> 57:13.179
- Man we all lose in the game, but...

57:13.873 --> 57:17.123
you got her pregnant,
made her get an abortion,

57:18.115 --> 57:21.698
and when she got it
you went back to Kathy.

57:23.730 --> 57:25.336
And then she tried to come back to me

57:25.336 --> 57:27.690
after all that but I couldn't do it.

57:27.690 --> 57:30.292
I'm not mad I lost her to you,

57:30.292 --> 57:32.434
I'm mad you messed up a good woman.

57:32.434 --> 57:37.357
- Okay, I mean technically I
mean you're right, all right.

57:37.357 --> 57:39.304
I messed up a good woman,
if that's how you feel,

57:39.304 --> 57:41.917
look so be it man, all right.

57:41.917 --> 57:44.456
I'll take that, but what you rather me do?

57:44.456 --> 57:46.431
Stay with her and be miserable?

57:46.431 --> 57:49.597
Like who wins in that
Justin, huh, who wins?

57:49.597 --> 57:52.294
Me and that kid would have been miserable.

57:52.294 --> 57:54.774
- So you happy now right, huh?

57:54.774 --> 57:55.874
- What?

57:55.874 --> 57:56.766
- Look at you, you out with us 'cause

57:56.766 --> 57:58.216
your girl kicked you out.

57:58.216 --> 58:00.177
- Wow.

58:00.177 --> 58:01.177
- Damn king.

58:02.616 --> 58:05.517
Your lips are loose Terry.

58:05.517 --> 58:08.276
- You man what do you expect
from me, that's my baby bro.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.816
If I can't tell him, who can I tell?

58:09.816 --> 58:10.898
- Whatever.

58:10.898 --> 58:12.175
- All men don't cry in the dark.

58:12.175 --> 58:15.377
And yo you, you are mad gay
for letting that slip out.

58:15.377 --> 58:17.378
- Naw, your father's mad gay.

58:17.378 --> 58:20.255
Joel had it coming and I needed
to get this off my chest.

58:20.255 --> 58:24.098
- Oh I had it coming,
seriously?

58:24.098 --> 58:26.265
Well are you finished yet?

58:27.256 --> 58:28.952
Because I'd much rather
hear about this story

58:28.952 --> 58:30.460
about how this drunk ass white boy

58:30.460 --> 58:32.312
almost fucked you up in the bar.

58:33.592 --> 58:34.425
Yeah.

58:34.425 --> 58:35.258
- Yo, how are you a lawyer?

58:35.258 --> 58:38.427
How are you a lawyer,
your lips is mad loose.

58:38.427 --> 58:42.594
- Right, you want me to
cry in the dark too right.

59:00.546 --> 59:04.787
- Damn, how long it's
gone take her to get home?

59:10.947 --> 59:13.107
- Oh man, man
you wrong for that one.

59:13.107 --> 59:16.440
- Yo baby bro, tell J about that

59:17.685 --> 59:19.610
drunk ass white boy in the club.

59:19.610 --> 59:20.860
- Man.

59:21.870 --> 59:23.491
- You got to hear this.

59:25.070 --> 59:26.350
- Crazy yo, I'm just chilling like I

59:26.350 --> 59:28.067
normally do, minding my own business,

59:28.067 --> 59:30.147
and this dude wanted to ...

59:30.147 --> 59:31.671
- It was at 10:30 in the morning, so I

59:32.896 --> 59:35.108
was not like, I was not awake.

59:35.108 --> 59:36.526
I was like rushing 'cause
I thought I was ...

59:37.935 --> 59:39.685
- Just go up there and just do it man.

59:42.964 --> 59:43.797
- Oh yeah.

59:43.797 --> 59:45.537
- Yeah, he was supposed
to come here earlier

59:45.537 --> 59:47.098
so he could like pass out cards and stuff.

59:47.098 --> 59:49.178
- Oh cool, nice, that
would make a really yeah.

59:49.178 --> 59:50.678
- Hey, hey.

59:52.286 --> 59:53.119
- Yes.

59:53.519 --> 59:55.540
- So do you want to come back and have

59:55.540 --> 59:58.790
a couple of drinks with me and my boys?

01:00:00.052 --> 01:00:02.079
- Yeah, no.

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:05.355
Like I told you earlier,
I'm fine where I am.

01:00:07.363 --> 01:00:08.430
- What, no?

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.978
You haven't even given
our table a chance yet.

01:00:09.978 --> 01:00:12.996
- Look there are plenty of
women here that I'm sure

01:00:12.996 --> 01:00:15.756
someone else will come to
your table, but thank you.

01:00:15.756 --> 01:00:17.682
- Eww.

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.993
- Okay dude, it's time for you to

01:00:19.993 --> 01:00:21.559
listen to this lady and move on.

01:00:21.559 --> 01:00:22.934
- Who are you?

01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:24.855
- Chloe do you know this dude?

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:28.055
- No, I mean I met him earlier, but I

01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:30.295
told him I was here with someone.

01:00:30.295 --> 01:00:34.208
- Okay dude, it's time for
you to move the fuck on.

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.500
- Me move the fuck on?

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.540
- Yeah.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.900
Me move the fuck on.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.902
- Yeah.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.410
- Me move the fuck on, me?

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.735
Me move the fuck.

01:00:47.033 --> 01:00:48.071
- That's when you called

01:00:48.071 --> 01:00:49.595
your brother to come bail you out right?

01:00:49.595 --> 01:00:50.911
- Whatever.

01:00:55.377 --> 01:00:56.981
- Kings, we're here.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.679
- All right.

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:15.016
Hey Justin man, my bad.

01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:17.142
I want to put this behind us you know.

01:01:17.142 --> 01:01:18.940
Forgive a brother?

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.161
- Yeah we good.

01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:21.324
- We good.

01:01:21.324 --> 01:01:25.241
- But you got to let me
know what happens next.

01:01:37.059 --> 01:01:39.559
- How long do we have to wait?

01:01:43.201 --> 01:01:45.951
- Man why are you so insensitive?

01:01:49.382 --> 01:01:50.629
We're talking about my brother here,

01:01:50.629 --> 01:01:52.262
I've never met this man in my life.

01:01:52.262 --> 01:01:53.457
Have a little compassion.

01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:55.582
- Compassion, remember how we found

01:01:55.582 --> 01:01:57.118
you and what you were doing?

01:01:57.118 --> 01:02:00.284
And how, yeah there ain't no telling

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:01.822
how many others there were.

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:03.862
You want me to have compassion for you

01:02:03.862 --> 01:02:07.362
and your late ass brother, absolutely not.

01:02:08.945 --> 01:02:10.386
- Thrill...

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:12.952
relax please.

01:02:12.952 --> 01:02:16.182
- Relax, relax, how the
hell you want me to relax

01:02:16.182 --> 01:02:18.462
if you're telling me that's half the team

01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:21.782
that's supposed to lead us
against the oppressors, huh?

01:02:21.782 --> 01:02:22.957
You fucking kidding me.

01:02:23.798 --> 01:02:26.065
- It's enough room in this
fight for everyone man.

01:02:26.065 --> 01:02:28.886
He didn't fulfill his purpose
'cause he didn't know.

01:02:28.886 --> 01:02:30.982
He still doesn't, none of us do.

01:02:30.982 --> 01:02:33.985
I'll be damned if I don't try to put

01:02:33.985 --> 01:02:36.851
this thing together to figure it all out.

01:02:59.784 --> 01:03:01.072
- So you're my brother?

01:03:02.464 --> 01:03:03.864
- No, I am.

01:03:23.396 --> 01:03:28.146
- I got a brother
man, I really got a brother.

01:03:36.133 --> 01:03:38.512
- I heard about you.

01:03:41.412 --> 01:03:44.495
Yeah, all this time you were the one.

01:03:46.191 --> 01:03:48.691
How did I not figure this out?

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.114
I heard a couple of
times you let some white

01:03:55.114 --> 01:03:57.399
people die when you could have saved them.

01:03:57.399 --> 01:03:59.032
- And I did, you got a problem with that?

01:03:59.032 --> 01:04:01.874
- All lives should matter when

01:04:01.874 --> 01:04:04.146
you possess the powers we have.

01:04:04.146 --> 01:04:06.171
Scholar, where you get

01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:07.696
this clown from man?

01:04:07.696 --> 01:04:10.685
We'll never win a war with
men that think like this.

01:04:10.685 --> 01:04:12.730
- Who you calling a clown?

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:16.655
- Kings don't fight kings.

01:04:17.964 --> 01:04:19.581
Man...this guy.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.632
- It's brother man.

01:04:32.008 --> 01:04:34.450
- So tell me, why not save everyone

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:38.283
except just saving the
black and brown people?

01:04:39.853 --> 01:04:43.567
- I can't believe you even
need a answer for that.

01:04:43.567 --> 01:04:45.730
I used to be like you.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.151
I used to think the more of them we saved,

01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:49.617
the more they'll
reconfigure their thoughts

01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:51.367
and see us different.

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:55.210
More in the shadows, hiding,
concealing our powers.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:59.377
I realized that seen the
same footage that we saw.

01:05:00.382 --> 01:05:03.060
They can longer play
ignorance to the killings.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.705
They kept killing us.

01:05:04.705 --> 01:05:07.424
That's when I realized that
they don't give a fuck.

01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:10.507
And if that's the case, why should I?

01:05:13.162 --> 01:05:14.662
The only way to convince the convinced,

01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:17.329
is through force, not diplomacy.

01:05:19.126 --> 01:05:20.614
- You're wrong.

01:05:20.614 --> 01:05:23.505
You're wrong, they do see and they change.

01:05:23.505 --> 01:05:26.588
It's a hard fight, but it's worth it.

01:05:27.766 --> 01:05:32.516
- Well, until all of them
change, I'm saving mine first.

01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:40.370
So what's going on Scholar,
what are we gonna do next?

01:05:48.004 --> 01:05:50.587
- You gonna put these rings on.

01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:54.887
Once they're on, you'll merge as one.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.553
- Why they blue?

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.460
- 'Cause they made from dragon

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.043
stones from the fire mountains.

01:06:11.898 --> 01:06:14.081
- I thought you were Christian?

01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:15.733
Doesn't all this mythical mumbo

01:06:15.733 --> 01:06:17.991
jumbo shit go against your beliefs?

01:06:19.974 --> 01:06:22.266
- I am always struggling
with my faith and my powers.

01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:25.248
But it comes a time when I got to

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:28.748
put down the Bible and unleash the swords.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.339
The time is now.

01:06:58.695 --> 01:07:02.778
- There it is, here it
is, two monkeys fighting.

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.739
This guy got tickets right here.

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:10.380
- We at the fight.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.523
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me and the fellas.

01:07:11.523 --> 01:07:14.462

01:07:16.128 --> 01:07:16.961
- We going to have a good time tonight.

01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:18.138

01:07:25.043 --> 01:07:27.289
- Justin you still got the jokes man.

01:07:30.014 --> 01:07:31.780
- I'm here with my dude, my dude.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.824
- Come on Terry.

01:07:32.824 --> 01:07:34.723
- I just have a couple
of questions to ask.

01:07:34.723 --> 01:07:35.944
- All right.

01:07:35.944 --> 01:07:37.262
- For your adoring fans?

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.782
- Oh you're doing an interview?

01:07:38.782 --> 01:07:40.104

01:07:40.104 --> 01:07:41.800
Your adoring fans around
the world want to know,

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.143
what it's like to play a superhero?

01:07:45.143 --> 01:07:46.424
- A superhero?

01:07:46.424 --> 01:07:47.544
- Yes.

01:07:47.544 --> 01:07:50.120
- Yeah man, I'm playing Thrill.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.462

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.542
and strength, I actually wish
I had some of that stuff too.

01:07:59.692 --> 01:08:03.609
- Whoo, the fights

01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:10.008

01:08:15.108 --> 01:08:16.881

01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:18.179
- Nacho...nacho man.

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:21.379
- I feel like this is gonna be a disaster.

01:08:21.379 --> 01:08:23.662

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.479

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:42.840

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.779

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.161
Somebody help!

01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:55.142
- I got you, I got you.

01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:57.356
Hold on, hold on.

01:14:57.356 --> 01:14:59.425
- Come on, please send a car.

01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:01.480
- Yo tell them
to fucking hurry up man.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.980
- Oh man, please,
please, please, please Joel.

01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:20.681
- Yo J, yo J.

01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:24.348
- Joel, Joel,
aww fam, Joel breathe.

01:15:27.102 --> 01:15:29.737
- Tell them to hurry up, tell
them fucking hurry up man.

01:15:29.737 --> 01:15:30.570
Fuck.

01:15:56.271 --> 01:15:58.854
- What the fuck did you do man?

01:16:03.865 --> 01:16:08.865
- You got one chance, and you
better make it make sense.

01:16:08.905 --> 01:16:12.988
- Not that I owe you
anything, but I'll tell you.

01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:16.862
The original order that killed Nat Turner

01:16:16.862 --> 01:16:19.318
and Eston Hemings, were called The Guards.

01:16:19.318 --> 01:16:24.318
And we were started by Thomas
Jefferson's wife Martha.

01:16:24.505 --> 01:16:26.585
I'm a descendant of that order

01:16:26.585 --> 01:16:28.702
and I have pledged my loyalty to take

01:16:28.702 --> 01:16:30.841
down any twin of the unholy offspring

01:16:30.841 --> 01:16:33.174
of Thomas and Sally Hemings.

01:16:35.494 --> 01:16:38.911
The bullet that killed JFK, Madam Walker,

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:45.130
and the others, were made from
the same stone as this knife.

01:16:47.908 --> 01:16:50.960
The same stone that were gonna
give you your powers back

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.665
is the same stone I'm gonna kill you with.

01:16:54.665 --> 01:16:56.964
So, now that you know

01:16:56.964 --> 01:16:59.881
are we gonna keep talking or fight.

01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:05.646
'Cause there's a lot more killing to do.

01:17:37.464 --> 01:17:40.047
- He's stronger than I thought.

01:17:41.225 --> 01:17:43.588
- I could use my powers to
take the knife out his hand.

01:17:43.588 --> 01:17:46.809
But after that you on your own man.

01:17:46.809 --> 01:17:48.892
- All right do it, do it.

01:19:42.294 --> 01:19:43.366
- Our work is never done.

01:20:03.963 --> 01:20:05.544
- Thank you for joining us
today on the Kaylie Jones Show.

01:20:05.544 --> 01:20:07.165
I'm your host Kaylie Jones.

01:20:07.165 --> 01:20:10.619
We begin today's show with
heavy hearts as the funeral

01:20:10.619 --> 01:20:13.122
for actor Joel Spence took place today.

01:20:13.122 --> 01:20:15.945
Spence played the character Thrill on

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.068
the hit TV show 'Revolution'.

01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.825
I had the opportunity to
play a character on the show,

01:20:20.825 --> 01:20:23.326
where I was able to get
to know Joel personally.

01:20:23.326 --> 01:20:26.126
The world had lost a great actor.

01:20:26.126 --> 01:20:30.526
I have lost an amazing
friend, and this industry

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:33.225
has lost a tremendous talent.

01:20:33.225 --> 01:20:35.300
With all the questions swirling around,

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.684
fans are left to wonder, what is to become

01:20:37.684 --> 01:20:41.351
of the hit show in the
wake of this tragedy.

01:20:43.685 --> 01:20:46.823
- Yes, I have the action figures.

01:20:46.823 --> 01:20:49.656
I must say that playing with black

01:20:50.869 --> 01:20:53.189
action figures is pretty damn awesome.

01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:56.149
I wish I had them when I was young.

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:59.482
Yeah, I just came back from the funeral.

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:03.465
And, I have to tell you, I don't think

01:21:03.465 --> 01:21:05.312
they're going to convict him.

01:21:05.312 --> 01:21:09.109
Listen, I'm a black man and if three dudes

01:21:09.109 --> 01:21:13.692
came up to me at an ATM with
hoodies on, I'd be scared.

01:21:15.806 --> 01:21:17.904
Two lawyers, a world famous
actor, it doesn't matter.

01:21:17.904 --> 01:21:21.685
Three black men in hoodies at an ATM.

01:21:21.685 --> 01:21:24.602
That's all the jury's going to see.

01:21:26.451 --> 01:21:28.720
Anyway, five seasons in the can

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.120
and the board wants them all released.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.298
So let's put the contracts together

01:21:32.298 --> 01:21:34.762
and make sure Joel's
kids are taken care of

01:21:34.762 --> 01:21:37.429
