01:18.969 --> 01:22.917
This is the daily report of Captain F.
Hollister of the mining ship Red Dwarf.

01:22.918 --> 01:26.965
Several of my crew are presently being
tried for crimes against the Space Corps.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.206
This is gonna sound nuts, but the
whole crew died, including you!

01:31.707 --> 01:34.930
And you've all been resurrected
by these microscopic little robots!

01:34.965 --> 01:37.872
I've got to track down these
nano's, to corroborate our story.

01:37.873 --> 01:40.041
Otherwise, who's going
to believe our defence?

01:40.042 --> 01:42.302
Only meths drinkers and
the corn circle society.

01:43.306 --> 01:44.300
I need your help, man.

01:45.304 --> 01:49.301
I've seen the crew's files, medical records,
sessions with the therapist, the works.

01:50.302 --> 01:51.584
I can make you look like a genius.

01:51.585 --> 01:54.299
You can get promoted in the field,
man, you won't have to take exams..

01:54.334 --> 01:56.264
Just, help me escape.

01:56.299 --> 02:02.199
I have my principles, Lister. You think you
can buy me with promises of power and glory?

02:02.200 --> 02:07.303
You really think... okay, I'll do it.
But you'll have to prove it to me first.

02:07.604 --> 02:08.369
You're on.

02:08.704 --> 02:09.507
Get me promoted.

02:10.303 --> 02:13.215
You'll find the confidential
files in Starbug's cockpit.

02:13.216 --> 02:17.303
There's a senile version of Holly loaded
into this watch. He'll lead you to it.

02:21.302 --> 02:22.002
Yes!

02:39.298 --> 02:40.298
My captain, sir.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.762
Rimmer, is this salute ever gonna end?

02:48.363 --> 02:52.297
Err, do I have time to go for a
cup of coffee? Maybe go on vacation?

02:53.300 --> 02:56.752
Nearly finished sir. It's my
very special extra long salute,

02:56.753 --> 02:59.299
I reserve for the
especially important, sir.

03:10.294 --> 03:11.297
You wanted to see me?

03:12.299 --> 03:15.429
I'm concerned over some of the
safety procedures on board, sir.

03:15.430 --> 03:18.755
There's a potentially lethal
scenario concerning drive plates, sir.

03:19.156 --> 03:22.242
Obviously, anyone who mis-repaired
one of these plates would have

03:22.243 --> 03:25.609
to have a brain the size of a
leprechaun's testicle, nevertheless, sir,

03:25.610 --> 03:28.400
like German tourists,
the stupid are everywhere.

03:31.806 --> 03:33.805
I propose the following
new safety procedures, sir.

03:38.799 --> 03:40.299
Did you really think of this?

03:40.334 --> 03:41.800
Permission to look smug, sir.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.800
Permission granted.

03:48.806 --> 03:50.799
Good work, Rimmer. Great work.

03:51.804 --> 03:54.811
Oh, before I go, sir. Happy
wedding anniversary, sir.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.063
"Anus Soothe Pile Cream.

04:02.864 --> 04:07.109
The easy-to-apply cream that
comes with its own special glove".

04:18.101 --> 04:23.102
"One size fits all"... I
could tell from your walk.

04:26.107 --> 04:31.104
Rimmer... could you post this for me?

04:35.101 --> 04:36.099
Why, certainly, sir.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.105
Oh, its addressed to me, sir?

04:43.101 --> 04:46.100
I'm giving a supper for some of the guys
that I've marked out for greater things.

04:47.105 --> 04:49.109
And you want me to be the wine waiter, sir?

04:50.102 --> 04:53.975
This report is first rate! Now,
I want you to come to supper.

04:53.976 --> 04:57.098
See you on Friday.
Incidentally, its black tie...

04:58.099 --> 05:00.020
Thai, Chinese, I'll eat anything, sir!

05:01.921 --> 05:04.101
Though, I would prefer
it if it wasn't black...

05:04.602 --> 05:06.099
any chance of having
mine medium-rare, sir?

05:07.098 --> 05:10.102
Just go! Wear what the hell you want...

05:52.188 --> 05:54.191
Fill this up, behind the screen.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.189
Kryten, hi...

06:37.185 --> 06:38.188
What are you doing here?

06:40.784 --> 06:41.984
What's wrong?

06:42.184 --> 06:44.189
I've been classified as a woman.

06:46.185 --> 06:48.190
A woman, why?

06:49.186 --> 06:51.183
Well, because I haven't got a... penis...

06:52.185 --> 06:55.442
It's a Space Corps. directive to
prevent gender ambiguity in jail.

06:56.443 --> 06:59.186
What's the saying, "if you've got
nothing to swing, you can't be with Bing".

07:01.188 --> 07:03.155
Well, what happened, did you lose it?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.935
I was never issued with one,
ma'am. Well, why would I need one,

07:05.936 --> 07:07.265
unless somehow I lost both arms

07:07.266 --> 07:10.180
and there was an emergency situation
to write my name in the snow.

07:11.232 --> 07:15.230
But hey, now you're a woman its going to
mean some big changes in the way you behave.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.838
I'm not going to be a woman
for long, ma'am. Just overnight.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.142
They want my permission to
repair my corrupted files.

07:21.143 --> 07:23.232
Tomorrow afternoon.
Restore my factory settings!

07:24.228 --> 07:26.730
But your corrupted files
are what makes you you!

07:26.765 --> 07:29.233
I've been diagnosed as
being quirky and unstable!

07:30.229 --> 07:32.576
Spin my nipple-nuts
and send me to Alaska!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.472
Quirky!? How could they
reach a verdict like that?

07:34.873 --> 07:36.231
And as for unstable! It makes me so...

07:41.230 --> 07:43.230
Darn it, I still haven't got
the hang of that emotion, have I?

07:43.265 --> 07:44.191
What was it supposed to be?

07:44.226 --> 07:47.091
Ambivalence. Didn't come
out right though, did it?

07:47.092 --> 07:49.235
I look like Mister Lister
when he's forced to eat fruit.

07:51.226 --> 07:52.232
Well, look, what are you going to do?

07:53.226 --> 07:56.229
Why, I have to go along with them, ma'am...
I can't say no, they are my superiors.

07:56.264 --> 07:57.191
Look, you've got to say no!

07:57.226 --> 08:00.232
I can't! They're better than
me, I'm, I'm not strong enough!

08:01.224 --> 08:03.806
Right, here's a tip: if
you get scared tomorrow,

08:03.807 --> 08:07.231
just imagine what they look like
on the loo... can you see them?

08:08.225 --> 08:12.230
No, I... Ooh..! Yes, I can!

08:13.624 --> 08:14.488
Do they still seem better than you?

08:14.489 --> 08:15.229
No, ma'am!

08:15.230 --> 08:17.192
- Do they still seem superior?
- No, ma'am!

08:17.227 --> 08:20.229
That's what you've got to do
tomorrow! Just re-create that picture!

08:22.024 --> 08:23.232
- It works for everyone!
- Yes!

08:24.226 --> 08:25.227
Who are you looking at now?

08:25.262 --> 08:26.223
You, ma'am!

08:29.228 --> 08:30.228
Be upstanding.

08:32.224 --> 08:33.720
Just relax, Rimmer's
gonna help us escape.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.224
This enquiry's a piece of cake, we're
just going through the motions...

08:38.225 --> 08:39.224
Let's get this enquiry under way.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.223
You have refused defense
assistance, is that right?

08:48.224 --> 08:49.161
Okay, this is what we do.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.364
I've watched a lot of TV shows and
we all huddle together like this

08:52.365 --> 08:56.226
and whisper for a while before we answer.
It looks like we know what we're doing!

08:57.226 --> 08:59.223
We intend to defend ourselves!

09:00.221 --> 09:01.223
You see how good that looked?

09:02.221 --> 09:03.223
Are you familiar with the mind scan?

09:04.225 --> 09:06.189
We are familiar with the mind scan, sir.

09:06.224 --> 09:09.588
You are aware that it pictorially
enhances the cognitive process,

09:09.589 --> 09:11.650
making your innermost thoughts available

09:11.651 --> 09:14.227
for recording and viewing
to a board of enquiry?

09:14.262 --> 09:14.962
Yes, sir.

09:15.219 --> 09:19.122
You understand that it will involve the
administration of psychotropic drugs,

09:19.123 --> 09:21.424
that is, drugs that
affect your mental state,

09:21.425 --> 09:24.226
making this process possible?
If you accept, say 'aye'.

09:24.261 --> 09:25.218
Aye.

09:26.223 --> 09:29.222
Please sign the consent forms and
seal them into the envelopes provided.

09:31.227 --> 09:33.225
We reconvene at 10am tomorrow.

09:45.217 --> 09:50.400
The plan's working, Listy. Operation Get
Rimmer Officerhood, Power and Eminence,

09:50.401 --> 09:53.216
or G.R.O.P.E. for
short, is bang on course.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.217
That information I gave you on
the drive plates worked, then? Yes!

09:57.331 --> 09:58.389
He's never been so pleased!

09:58.890 --> 10:01.326
And, get this, he's invited me to
supper with the movers and the shakers.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.334
The movers and the shakers?

10:03.630 --> 10:07.334
Not me, Listy. I'm on my way,
up the ziggurat, lickety-split.

10:08.329 --> 10:09.328
Well, don't forget your part of the deal.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.332
The override code for this so I can leg it.

10:12.331 --> 10:13.329
It's too soon, I'm not an officer yet!

10:14.933 --> 10:16.500
The trial begins tomorrow, man!

10:17.101 --> 10:19.336
Without the nanobots our defence
has got more holes than my socks.

10:20.832 --> 10:22.588
But once you've legged it,
where does that leave me?

10:23.089 --> 10:25.449
I'm not helping you escape and
losing all my insider knowledge.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.334
I'm not an officer yet.

10:27.328 --> 10:29.294
Woh! we shook hands on a deal!

10:29.829 --> 10:31.443
Yeah but, Lister, you know me;

10:31.444 --> 10:33.727
my handshake's less reliable
than a plumber's estimate.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.331
No escapo, no more info.

10:39.326 --> 10:44.643
Listy, its not going to help you.
I've got the confidential files.

10:44.644 --> 10:49.326
Plus, I went through Starbug's
salvage, and I found these:

10:52.326 --> 10:53.327
The Luck virus... Sexual Magnetism.

10:54.330 --> 10:57.629
Positive viruses, Holly
told me everything.

10:58.630 --> 11:03.327
Take some of this, it gives you luck,
and this, gives you sexual magnetism.

11:04.326 --> 11:05.836
I've already tried some; right now,

11:05.837 --> 11:09.331
Yvonne McGruder is sleeping off the first
twenty-three pages of the Kame Sutra.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.776
So, you reneged on the deal,
then? Breaking your promise?

11:17.877 --> 11:20.324
So you're a total scum-sucking,
two-faced, weaselly weasel?

11:22.331 --> 11:23.325
Ah, my entry in "Who's Who".

11:29.325 --> 11:31.329
You left some of your luck
behind, man. I touched the tube...

11:38.406 --> 11:39.406
Sheer luck...

11:44.804 --> 11:47.801
You may, if you prefer,
stand with the others tomorrow

11:47.802 --> 11:49.168
and face the charges against you.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.857
However, I advise that you have
your corrupted files repaired,

11:52.858 --> 11:55.406
after which you may go
free. What is your decision?

11:58.671 --> 12:04.671
Nnnn-, nnnnn-, nnnnnnnn-, oh, its no good!

12:08.666 --> 12:10.914
Okay, let's all stay
calm! No need to be...

12:10.915 --> 12:13.367
After all, Kryten is
merely holding us hostage,

12:13.368 --> 12:15.666
which is lovely! Isn't
it, everyone? Lovely.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.663
We don't want any trouble.
We'll just do what you say.

12:19.661 --> 12:20.665
Come on, then. Come with me.

12:22.662 --> 12:24.314
Come on, inside, inside, that's it.

12:24.315 --> 12:27.664
Come on, all of you, quick, quick,
quick, quick. There we go, that's it.

12:27.699 --> 12:30.667
Now, I want you to take down
your pants, and sit on a toilet.

12:32.664 --> 12:33.662
My god, he's mad!

12:34.666 --> 12:35.665
Then what're you going to do to us..?

12:36.664 --> 12:37.662
I'm going to look at you.

12:40.465 --> 12:41.465
He's totally mad!

12:42.662 --> 12:43.668
Just... do what he says...

12:44.665 --> 12:45.365
Lovely...

12:54.667 --> 12:55.663
Now I want you to ask me the question again.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.429
"Do I want to have my
corrupted files repaired?"

12:59.430 --> 13:01.432
Do you want to have your
corrupted files repaired?

13:02.836 --> 13:08.433
Nnnnnn-, nnnnnnn-, nnnnnn-no.

13:08.434 --> 13:14.688
I did it. No, nnnnn-no, I don't.
The answer to the question is no.

13:14.689 --> 13:18.456
No doubt about it, I do not want
to have my corrupted files repaired.

13:18.557 --> 13:20.428
The answer is nnnnno!

13:28.182 --> 13:30.194
Hello. I'm the Data Doctor.

13:30.695 --> 13:35.156
If you would like me to examine
your hard disk, press 'Examine'.

13:36.455 --> 13:41.829
Your mechanoid appears to have
developed the following rogue emotions:

13:41.830 --> 13:48.037
affection, arrogance, envy, guilt, humour,
insecurity, petulance, possessiveness,

13:48.038 --> 13:49.476
snobbery, and love.

13:49.977 --> 13:55.000
If you wish to eradicate these
emotions from his database, press 'Fix'.

14:08.159 --> 14:13.159
All bad line blocks and corrupted
personality disks have now been fixed.

14:13.194 --> 14:15.155
Please reboot your mechanoid.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.164
His personality has now been restored -

14:17.199 --> 14:18.157
to its factory settings.

14:21.155 --> 14:25.154
My name is Kryten, I am programmed
to serve. Can I be of service?

14:27.158 --> 14:28.162
Bring me a coffee, please, Kryten.

14:29.157 --> 14:30.156
Certainly, ma'am.

14:32.161 --> 14:34.154
Then you may scrub the floor.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.154
Yes, ma'am.

14:37.155 --> 14:38.156
Are you happy -

14:39.153 --> 14:39.853
Kryten?

14:40.155 --> 14:44.157
I have no understanding of human
emotions, ma'am. I am programmed to serve.

14:46.157 --> 14:46.957
Excellent.

14:50.158 --> 14:53.155
I'm going to be 'Colin Charisma' at
the Captain's table with this stuff.

15:06.151 --> 15:07.156
Hi...

15:09.520 --> 15:13.513
And if we approach light speed, I think
we have to be aware we could come across

15:13.514 --> 15:16.520
something I believe we'll
experience called 'future echoes'.

15:21.513 --> 15:26.518
Certain pockets of... futurey
things. From the future.

15:27.519 --> 15:31.519
How fascinating... What a fascinating
man you are, Mister Rimmer...

15:32.519 --> 15:36.128
I think we've greatly underestimated
you over the years, Arnold.

15:36.129 --> 15:38.516
Now, let me find out
where that coffee is.

15:38.551 --> 15:39.517
Oh no, Captain, please, allow me.

15:41.514 --> 15:44.516
Perhaps, ah, you could
help me, Mister Rimmer..?

15:45.514 --> 15:48.522
Why, certainly, and perhaps we can talk
about my theory on backwards universes?

15:52.517 --> 15:55.511
And, of course, in a backwards universe
many things begin to make more sense -

15:58.512 --> 16:04.519
Oh my god, you are
sexy! So very, very sexy!

16:11.511 --> 16:13.478
Bravo, bud! What now?

16:13.513 --> 16:15.626
Well, we find Kryten,
get to the landing bay,

16:15.927 --> 16:17.509
grab a ship and get the hell outta town.

16:18.516 --> 16:19.515
He's on this floor.

16:24.512 --> 16:25.509
Here he is!

16:26.510 --> 16:27.514
Kryten, come on.

16:28.513 --> 16:31.510
Are you addressing me, sir? I don't
believe we've had the pleasure.

16:32.512 --> 16:33.762
What have they done to you, Kryten?

16:33.763 --> 16:35.511
You sound like Noel
Coward's elocution teacher!

16:36.508 --> 16:40.511
Well, if you'll forgive me, sir, I
have my duties to perform. Good day.

16:41.508 --> 16:45.508
Aw, they've fixed all his corrupted files.
He mustn't have been able to say 'no'.

16:47.112 --> 16:48.212
Someone's coming.

16:49.511 --> 16:50.508
We've got to get a better disguise.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.474
We've already got a disguise!

16:51.509 --> 16:54.513
What's the point of a disguise if you
wear it under your normal outfit, Cat?

16:55.509 --> 16:58.507
A grey boiler suit? You think I'm
gonna wear this on the outside? Ha!

17:01.507 --> 17:03.591
Look, we're not leaving without him.

17:04.492 --> 17:08.511
I don't care what they've done to him,
he's coming with us. He's part of the posse.

17:08.546 --> 17:11.506
Hey! I got a great idea for a new disguise!

17:15.106 --> 17:15.806
What?

17:17.488 --> 17:18.488
The Dibbley family!

17:23.492 --> 17:24.193
Yess!

17:41.491 --> 17:44.175
Ahhh, there you are!

17:50.176 --> 17:52.492
Any... news on the coffee?

17:55.487 --> 18:00.485
Drat. We forgot. I'll
find out right away, sir.

18:01.487 --> 18:03.489
I'll give you a hand, Mister Rimmer...

18:16.490 --> 18:18.014
Sorry to interrupt... sir,

18:18.315 --> 18:20.492
but we're searching this floor
for the escaped prisoners.

18:21.484 --> 18:25.484
Sorry, we haven't seen them. Just
me, my wife, here, and my brother.

18:26.284 --> 18:26.985
Hello!

18:27.020 --> 18:27.987
- Hi!
- Hi.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.449
I don't recollect seeing you guys before..?

18:30.484 --> 18:33.488
That's because we don't go
around much looking like this.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.485
What do you guys do?

18:37.482 --> 18:38.485
..Computer programmers.

18:42.487 --> 18:45.486
Well, if you see anything
suspicious, call security, okay?

18:45.521 --> 18:46.490
Er, you bet.

18:47.485 --> 18:49.484
Begging your pardon, sirs,
I just need to get a mop.

18:51.488 --> 18:53.481
How peculiar, my mop-heads are missing.

18:55.486 --> 18:59.882
Don't I know you, sir?
Wayne... Wayne, something.

19:00.383 --> 19:03.487
Wayne Wibbley? Where do I know you from?

19:04.484 --> 19:08.484
No, no, sir, you're mistaken. You're
mixing me up with some other big-teeth dork.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.488
No, let him speak.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.483
Where do you know him from?

19:12.518 --> 19:13.447
Are you out of your mind?

19:13.482 --> 19:15.450
Shh-shh! Where do you know him from? Think!

19:15.485 --> 19:19.448
I think I'm about to
discover something wonderful,

19:19.449 --> 19:25.744
but, when I discover it, it will put
someone in great danger. I feel an emotion.

19:25.745 --> 19:30.484
I feel two emotions; two
different emotions! I feel- I feel-

19:31.481 --> 19:32.181
Ambivalence?

19:33.481 --> 19:37.890
I can feel my files corrupting...
they're... corrupting,

19:37.891 --> 19:40.674
I... oohh, ohhh, oh
yes, that's good! Oohh!

19:43.075 --> 19:47.483
I'm back, and I'm bad! Obviously, within
certain sensible pre-set parameters...

19:49.477 --> 19:52.538
Attention, attention! Reported
prisoner sighting on C-deck,

19:52.539 --> 19:54.477
reported prisoner sighting on C-deck!

19:55.481 --> 19:56.478
Nice one, Holl...

20:00.479 --> 20:01.445
What's wrong with you?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.582
Well, do you get the
impression this is too easy?

20:03.583 --> 20:06.482
Like, everything's going for us?
Like they almost want us to escape!

20:08.478 --> 20:09.480
Hey, I was just thinking aloud!

20:10.475 --> 20:12.479
No, no! The Luck virus, it's helping us.

20:21.477 --> 20:22.475
Put your kit on.

20:35.478 --> 20:37.478
Here we are! Remembered the coffee at last.

20:39.474 --> 20:41.479
What about the mints?

20:44.478 --> 20:49.478
I'll go. Would you like to
help me, Mister Rimmer..?

20:52.473 --> 20:55.724
It's just, I've got so much coffee,

20:55.825 --> 20:57.476
I don't think I could manage to
get any mints until tomorrow...

21:03.475 --> 21:06.881
Well, the psychotropic testing
should be well underway by now.

21:07.782 --> 21:09.476
Those results sure are
going to be interesting.

21:10.475 --> 21:11.479
Psychotropic what?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.429
The Lister case is so unusual

21:14.430 --> 21:17.581
I decided to invoke my right
to use psychotropic evidence.

21:18.082 --> 21:21.382
The accused are drugged,
wired to a mainframe,

21:21.883 --> 21:25.669
then the computer feeds in
various hypothetical scenarios

21:25.670 --> 21:28.475
and their reactions
are laid down on tape.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.445
Right now, they believe
they're escaping,

21:30.446 --> 21:32.473
but we just want to
observe what they do...

21:33.474 --> 21:38.367
So, that means, that if anyone happens
to mention any... special agreements...

21:38.368 --> 21:40.473
that they've entered into, then -

21:42.472 --> 21:46.469
Could you excuse me? I think
I... left the iron on...

21:52.472 --> 21:53.172
Hi...

21:53.778 --> 21:56.963
What is wrong with me? I've got the
sexual appetite of a mountain lion,

21:56.964 --> 21:58.777
no, worse, a first year nursing student!

21:59.782 --> 22:01.777
It's just being wanted, it's such an
aphrodisiac. Got to get some control back!

22:59.777 --> 23:00.779
Hi.

23:03.808 --> 23:06.727
Never realised you were so
damn popular with the ladies...

23:07.328 --> 23:08.805
Maybe you can share
your secret sometime?

23:09.404 --> 23:10.204
Yes, sir.

23:35.806 --> 23:36.804
Guys, it's Bob and Max.

23:37.829 --> 23:38.965
Go on, shoo, guys, shoo, go on!

23:38.966 --> 23:39.820
We're trying to escape,

23:39.821 --> 23:41.824
but you'll never get past
security, so go on! Go on!
