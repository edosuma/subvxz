00:05.309 --> 00:07.785
<i>Accessing achived data.</i>

00:08.093 --> 00:11.759
<i>The Grid.
Hidden inside the computer.</i>

00:11.855 --> 00:16.077
<i>It was a peaceful world.
Protected by the hero Tron...</i>

00:16.111 --> 00:19.113
<i>until the corrupted program Clu
seized control.</i>

00:21.050 --> 00:23.996
<i>But the remote city of Argon
remained untouched.</i>

00:24.030 --> 00:27.933
<i>For these young mechanics,
life was good...</i>

00:27.967 --> 00:31.108
<i>until Clu's armies
made Argon their new home.</i>

00:31.143 --> 00:32.756
Greetings, programs.

00:32.790 --> 00:35.764
- If Tron were here...
- You mean if Tron were alive.

00:35.798 --> 00:36.798
No more games.

00:36.804 --> 00:37.970
Hey, you can't do this...

00:38.004 --> 00:39.840
<i>Following the loss of his friend,</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:43.851
<i>an ordinary mechanic named Beck
decides to fight back.</i>

00:43.885 --> 00:47.853
Tron saved the grid before.
Maybe he could do it again.

00:47.888 --> 00:50.689
This renegade Tron, whoever he is,

00:50.724 --> 00:51.964
he's causing a lot of problems.

00:51.991 --> 00:55.759
<i>His actions caught the attention
of someone unexpected.</i>

00:55.794 --> 00:57.727
- I'm not dead.
- Tron.

00:57.761 --> 01:00.996
I need you to help me
carry on my name.

01:01.030 --> 01:04.730
Be the next Tron.

01:09.071 --> 01:13.044
<i>Expect your training to be
a long, difficult road, Beck.</i>

01:13.078 --> 01:16.750
<i>Before victory,
there will be setbacks.</i>

01:18.786 --> 01:20.687
<i>Many of them.</i>

01:29.098 --> 01:32.902
Tron!
When does the training start.

01:34.071 --> 01:35.071
Now!

01:36.808 --> 01:38.842
So try and keep up.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.113
Don't rely on your light wall.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.081
Learn to control me without it.

01:48.985 --> 01:52.121
Dominate with momentum.
Anticipate.

01:54.825 --> 01:58.062
- You mean like that?
- Eyes forward.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.768
This isn't a game, Beck.

02:06.939 --> 02:09.774
- Jump.
- Jump?

02:17.785 --> 02:20.788
We can't make that.

02:45.032 --> 02:54.532
<b>S01E02 - The Renegade, Part 1</b>

03:02.248 --> 03:04.082
You know what
you did wrong, Beck?

03:04.117 --> 03:06.218
Yeah, I followed you.

03:06.252 --> 03:10.155
You hesitated. I didn't.

03:11.841 --> 03:13.809
How can I be the next Tron

03:13.843 --> 03:15.978
if I can't even keep up
with the real one?

03:16.012 --> 03:18.080
No one's gonna believe I'm you.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.083
To them, I'm just
a renegade program.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.185
You need to have faith in yourself.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.956
Easy for you to say. You were
programmed to protect the grid.

03:26.991 --> 03:29.058
I was programmed to tune up engines.

03:29.092 --> 03:31.928
You're more than
just a mechanic, Beck.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.030
You surpassed your programming.

03:34.064 --> 03:37.834
You stood up for what you
believed in, all on your own.

03:37.868 --> 03:40.170
<i>The uprising needs a hero like you.</i>

03:40.204 --> 03:43.206
<i>What uprising? It's just
you and me out here.</i>

03:43.241 --> 03:45.309
Aren't you the one
who said others will follow?

03:45.343 --> 03:48.211
That the revolution will spread
if we ignite the spark?

03:48.245 --> 03:50.146
What, you're listening to me now?

03:50.181 --> 03:52.215
I almost plunged
into the bottom of a canyon.

03:53.350 --> 03:56.318
I don't think I'm cut out
to inspire anyone. Sorry.

03:56.352 --> 03:58.219
- Beck...
- What?

03:58.254 --> 03:59.954
Your baton...

03:59.988 --> 04:03.123
<i>you should probably get that.</i>

04:03.158 --> 04:05.158
<i>Right.</i>

04:18.908 --> 04:23.212
<i>Halt, program.
You're in violation of curfew.</i>

04:23.246 --> 04:26.115
It just gets better and better.

04:29.887 --> 04:31.220
<i>Identify.</i>

04:37.127 --> 04:39.161
<i>Hostile program detected.</i>

04:49.039 --> 04:51.040
<i>Secure sector 12.</i>

05:04.087 --> 05:06.856
Please tell me you're hiding, too.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.226
<i>Proceed with transport.</i>

05:12.162 --> 05:13.796
<i>Charting flight course. Confirm.</i>

05:13.830 --> 05:16.833
<i>Flight course
confirmed. Redirecting.</i>

05:20.605 --> 05:23.038
Congratulations, program.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.274
You just made yourself a prisoner.

05:29.045 --> 05:31.913
This is wrong. I shouldn't be here.
I didn't do anything.

05:31.947 --> 05:33.815
This is all because of that Renegade.

05:33.849 --> 05:35.183
- The Renegade?
- Cool it, Rilo.

05:35.217 --> 05:37.085
Have you forgotten
where they're taking us?

05:37.119 --> 05:40.021
Each one of us is going
to end up de-rezzed.

05:40.055 --> 05:43.257
Have you ever seen anyone
derezzed? It's disgusting!

05:43.291 --> 05:46.126
What's he talking about?
Where are we going?

05:48.262 --> 05:49.863
There.

05:51.098 --> 05:53.065
The games.

05:55.268 --> 05:59.137
<i>Approaching Armory 5.
Final approach.</i>

06:02.008 --> 06:03.328
<i>Armory fourth pier.</i>

06:05.144 --> 06:07.946
<i>Welcome to the Coliseum.</i>

06:13.919 --> 06:15.787
Sorry, boss.
I thought he was with you.

06:15.821 --> 06:17.155
Well, let me know if you see him.

06:27.934 --> 06:32.904
Zed! Laura! Did Beck
even bother to come in today?

06:32.938 --> 06:35.072
I'm sure he's just taking a break.

06:35.107 --> 06:37.141
Actually, it's just been
me and Zed all shift.

06:37.175 --> 06:40.844
We're supposed to meet him at the
club later. Should we be worried?

06:40.879 --> 06:43.814
Nah. I was just gonna let him
put up one of my bikes.

06:43.848 --> 06:45.882
My favorite, actually.

06:50.288 --> 06:51.288
Whoa.

06:51.323 --> 06:54.291
What's so special about this old thing?

06:54.326 --> 06:59.965
Old thing? Zed, this is
Encom 7861st-gen light bike.

06:59.999 --> 07:04.304
It's one of a kind. Every
component designed for speed.

07:04.338 --> 07:07.240
Yeah, but it doesn't look very safe.

07:07.275 --> 07:11.912
Give me a new model any time.
You can't beat reliable.

07:11.946 --> 07:15.849
I don't want reliable.
I want dangerous.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.117
Mm.

07:17.151 --> 07:22.021
Well, it's nice to see someone's got
an appreciation for older technology.

07:22.056 --> 07:24.858
Can you let Beck know it's in my office?

07:24.892 --> 07:28.128
I hope he's not
getting himself in any trouble.

07:32.968 --> 07:34.802
<i>Congratulations, programs.</i>

07:34.836 --> 07:37.104
<i>You have been selected for the games.</i>

07:37.139 --> 07:39.273
If I don't survive,
that Renegade is to blame.

07:39.307 --> 07:41.275
- Lionel, I told you.
- It's not his fault?

07:41.309 --> 07:44.279
The only reason we're here is because
the Renegade remodeled Clu's statue.

07:44.313 --> 07:47.149
The next thing I know, they
pick me up for breaking curfew.

07:47.183 --> 07:50.018
I lost track of time.
I shouldn't have to die for it.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.888
We'll survive this.
You're not going to die.

07:58.862 --> 08:02.898
<i>For your safety, you are being
equipped with battle armor.</i>

08:02.933 --> 08:05.868
<i>Do not attempt to remove your armor.</i>

08:07.437 --> 08:11.240
<i>Processing complete.
Enjoy the games.</i>

08:39.135 --> 08:42.136
<i>All combatants prepare for team battle.</i>

08:44.173 --> 08:47.076
<i>Difficulty level: Extreme.</i>

08:54.051 --> 08:56.887
So, you still think we're gonna survive?

09:03.863 --> 09:06.866
In the name of our great leader Clu...

09:06.900 --> 09:08.901
Let the games begin!

09:12.172 --> 09:13.806
Here they come.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.041
<i>Regiment, positions.</i>

09:20.246 --> 09:23.049
We're not gonna survive
two rounds against them!

09:23.083 --> 09:24.851
Stick close to me, Rilo.

09:28.822 --> 09:29.822
<i>Attack!</i>

09:40.974 --> 09:42.705
Excuse me.

09:49.809 --> 09:51.380
Ugh.

09:54.316 --> 09:58.572
Ugh, great. Just great.

10:13.193 --> 10:16.995
- Is that for me?
- Yeah, why not?

10:17.029 --> 10:18.230
Are you here alone, too?

10:18.264 --> 10:22.033
Actually, I'm here
with my friend, but I'm...

10:22.068 --> 10:24.035
I...

10:24.070 --> 10:25.303
- Zed.
- I'm Zed.

10:25.338 --> 10:27.239
I'm Zed. I'm Zed.

10:27.273 --> 10:28.440
Pearl.

10:35.314 --> 10:37.048
Resist!

10:37.083 --> 10:40.118
<i>Player 6 deleted.</i>

10:47.159 --> 10:49.994
- Hey, that was good!
- We're gonna make it.

10:52.330 --> 10:53.964
Stay close!

11:03.174 --> 11:08.178
<i>Last guard deleted.
Advantage challenger.</i>

11:09.314 --> 11:13.317
Rilo!

11:15.286 --> 11:16.954
<i>Player 11 deleted.</i>

11:16.988 --> 11:18.222
No!

11:20.191 --> 11:21.992
Get down!

11:26.197 --> 11:28.231
I couldn't save Rilo. He's gone.

11:28.266 --> 11:32.001
But we're not.
And neither are they.

11:32.035 --> 11:34.903
Then let's level the playing field.

11:38.007 --> 11:42.310
So the third siren says,
"I thought that disk looked familiar."

11:45.014 --> 11:48.015
I love a program
with a sense of humor.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.185
Mind if I borrow him?

11:51.219 --> 11:53.186
Just bring him back in one piece.

11:54.188 --> 11:58.057
Whoa, Zed. What's your secret?

11:58.092 --> 12:01.027
You know what they say, Mara.
It's all in the programming.

12:01.061 --> 12:05.131
Well, can you spare some
of that programming for one little dance?

12:05.165 --> 12:07.066
Dance? You and me?

12:07.100 --> 12:12.171
Come on! You owe me!
I'm your best friend, Zed.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.244
Right. Friends...

12:26.086 --> 12:27.886
- You, uh...
- Whoa!

12:27.921 --> 12:30.122
...wanna get out of here?

12:30.156 --> 12:33.325
Absolutely. Who was that girl?

12:33.360 --> 12:37.096
Ah, just a friend.

12:54.014 --> 12:58.418
<i>Last guard deleted.
Advantage challenger.</i>

13:00.154 --> 13:04.190
- Hmm, they're good.
- Too good. Sound the bell.

13:04.224 --> 13:06.959
- But the round...
- ...is over. Do it.

13:10.363 --> 13:16.000
<i>Due to technical difficulties,
this round will conclude early.</i>

13:23.142 --> 13:26.045
Wow, Argon's beautiful
from up here.

13:26.079 --> 13:29.081
It's all right.
Guess I'm just used to it.

13:29.116 --> 13:31.084
Well, it's a lot better
than where I'm from.

13:31.118 --> 13:32.252
Where's that?

13:32.286 --> 13:35.222
Doesn't matter. I'm here now.

13:35.256 --> 13:38.225
With you.

13:38.259 --> 13:42.062
So, what's there to do
for fun around here?

13:42.096 --> 13:46.032
Well, there's the park,
but it's closed for curfew.

13:46.066 --> 13:51.370
There's the Coliseum.
Yeah, not my idea of fun either.

13:51.405 --> 13:57.009
Is there any place in the city that's
not shut down by the occupation?

13:58.111 --> 14:00.914
These are your accommodations,
programs.

14:02.116 --> 14:03.917
We have new teammates to break in.

14:03.951 --> 14:06.220
You mean more programs to get derezzed.

14:06.254 --> 14:08.156
Don't tell me you've given up.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.992
We could use you out there.
You're not a bad fighter.

14:11.026 --> 14:14.997
Yeah, tell that to Rilo.

14:15.031 --> 14:19.001
I wasn't programmed for this.
I'm just a mechanic.

14:19.035 --> 14:22.171
So it's like that, huh? No hope?

14:22.205 --> 14:26.208
I felt that way once,
after we lost the ISO war.

14:26.242 --> 14:29.044
- You fought in the ISO war?
- That's right.

14:29.079 --> 14:31.247
Most of my friends fell
fighting Clu and his forces.

14:31.281 --> 14:35.885
I started to despair,
until the Renegade showed up.

14:35.919 --> 14:39.121
The Renegade?
Isn't this all his fault?

14:39.156 --> 14:42.959
I don't think so. If he's willing
to risk his life to find Beck,

14:42.993 --> 14:45.228
then I wanna be right there
fighting beside him.

14:45.262 --> 14:49.066
That's why I came to Argon, to join him.

14:49.100 --> 14:54.072
But there's more. I know
who the Renegade really is.

14:54.106 --> 14:57.175
- Who?
- We both know.

14:57.209 --> 15:00.111
He's the one program
who can save us all,

15:00.146 --> 15:03.281
whose name alone inspires hope.

15:03.316 --> 15:05.316
He's Tron.

15:07.886 --> 15:09.053
Tron.

15:13.106 --> 15:16.108
I have to say, this is kind of cool.

15:18.311 --> 15:21.913
There are programs upstairs.

15:21.947 --> 15:24.916
You're authorized, right?
So it's okay to go in.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.953
I don't think that's such a great idea.

15:30.923 --> 15:32.890
It'll be our secret.

15:48.174 --> 15:51.309
Tell the program
in front of you "Tron lives".

15:51.343 --> 15:53.111
- What?
- Just do it.

15:58.084 --> 15:59.885
Tron lives? Who told you that?

15:59.919 --> 16:02.187
<i>What was that?
Did you say Tron lives?</i>

16:02.221 --> 16:05.290
<i>Talk like that is sedition.
Who said it?</i>

16:17.237 --> 16:18.304
Let's go.

16:31.252 --> 16:34.822
Well, this is it, Able's office...

16:34.856 --> 16:38.225
central hub of the garage
and antiques warehouse.

16:38.260 --> 16:42.062
Actually, a lot of these
artifacts are priceless.

16:42.097 --> 16:44.965
I don't know.
Looks like junk to me.

16:46.934 --> 16:50.202
Well, it's getting kind of late.

16:50.237 --> 16:53.072
Uh, uh... Oh.

16:53.106 --> 16:55.208
- You know what this is?
- A baton?

16:55.242 --> 16:57.276
Well, not just any baton.

16:57.310 --> 17:00.879
This is a Rencon 682.

17:00.913 --> 17:03.848
You mean an Encom 786.

17:03.883 --> 17:07.185
Isn't that what I said?
It's one of a kind.

17:10.122 --> 17:13.858
You know,
my light cycle's been acting up.

17:13.892 --> 17:15.193
Think you can take a look?

17:15.227 --> 17:18.163
I'll have it singing in no time.

17:40.221 --> 17:42.823
Why am I not surprised?

17:43.858 --> 17:49.929
So, you two wanna be a team?
Then be a team.

17:52.199 --> 17:57.069
- I suppose it could be worse.
- It's worse.

17:57.103 --> 17:59.838
<i>Initiate light cycle challenge.</i>

17:59.873 --> 18:03.175
Three of them, two of us.
Those odds aren't so bad.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.276
But they got bikes.

18:21.162 --> 18:23.130
- Do you trust me?
- Do I have a choice?

18:24.999 --> 18:27.900
When I give the word,
pull as hard as you can.

18:31.138 --> 18:32.271
Now!

18:41.247 --> 18:43.883
<i>Rider 2 down.</i>

18:43.917 --> 18:44.917
Come on.

19:20.157 --> 19:21.992
Now this is more like it.

19:39.044 --> 19:44.115
<i>Rider 1 deleted.
Advantage challenger.</i>

19:51.022 --> 19:52.989
I bet you didn't know
I'm a mechanic.

19:55.226 --> 19:56.926
A pretty good one, too.

20:05.069 --> 20:07.136
<i>Challengers victorious.</i>

20:08.872 --> 20:12.274
<i>Listen to them, cheering
the actions of two conspirators.</i>

20:12.309 --> 20:17.179
This insolence will spread like
a plague if we don't end it now.

20:17.213 --> 20:19.014
So, end it!

20:19.048 --> 20:23.852
In all fairness to Paige,
her plan almost worked.

20:23.887 --> 20:26.955
May I suggest an alternative, general?

20:28.024 --> 20:30.926
You know, your bike's in decent
shape. I actually cant find...

20:31.961 --> 20:37.098
Then keep it.
I just got an Encom 786.

20:37.132 --> 20:38.199
See ya!

20:38.233 --> 20:41.135
Wait! Don't... leave.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.238
Oh, I'm an idiot!

20:49.146 --> 20:52.949
General Tesler was quite
impressed with your performance.

20:52.983 --> 20:56.319
We rarely get to see
such delicious competition.

20:56.354 --> 21:01.291
To thank you, general
Tesler's arranged a reward.

21:01.326 --> 21:07.298
<i>Greetings, programs!
Behold this momentous occasion!</i>

21:07.332 --> 21:10.134
For not only do you share
the privilege of seeing

21:10.168 --> 21:14.238
two highly skilled combatants
battle for survival,

21:14.272 --> 21:17.907
but now you can watch
as merciful general Tesler

21:17.942 --> 21:21.844
allows them to compete
for the greatest prize of all...

21:21.879 --> 21:22.979
freedom.

21:23.013 --> 21:26.315
The winner of the next round
will be released!

21:26.350 --> 21:28.050
Who are we fighting?

21:28.084 --> 21:31.120
Why, each other, of course.

21:32.956 --> 21:36.258
And to the death.
