00:06.298 --> 00:09.298
The need for love, marriage, and
lifelong commitment,

00:09.485 --> 00:13.745
the yearning to reproduce, and the
survival of the human race,

00:13.766 --> 00:15.926
the search for a vocation,

00:15.968 --> 00:17.968
the desire to find happiness,

00:18.208 --> 00:21.488
and the inevitable end - death.

00:22.268 --> 00:26.608
But Karl Pilkington has not given a
second thought to any of these issues.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.688
This cat's cross-eyed. Never seen
that before.

00:29.168 --> 00:32.828
Now he's turned 40, he thinks it's
time he did.

00:33.688 --> 00:38.128
He's travelling around the world to
see how other people deal with life's
big questions...

00:39.708 --> 00:42.088
We've had the Iron Age, the Stone
Age...

00:42.268 --> 00:44.168
This is the pissing about age.

00:45.328 --> 00:47.448
..and to see if the issues are such a
big deal anyway.

00:52.488 --> 00:56.028
In this episode, Karl explores how to
find happiness.

00:56.168 --> 00:58.448
What have you done to your tongue?
Have you seen that?

00:58.608 --> 01:00.208
That's like alien.

01:03.228 --> 01:04.988
Is it achieved by releasing stress?

01:05.788 --> 01:08.027
Can exercise make you happy?

01:08.028 --> 01:11.707
People shouldn't be running the
distances they're doing. It's barmy.

01:11.708 --> 01:13.807
Or should you just give up
everything?

01:13.808 --> 01:15.708
We've got two courses. We're
homeless.

01:15.828 --> 01:17.947
This is The Moaning of Life.

01:17.948 --> 01:21.588
It's like, who's the mental one
here? Is it me, or everyone else?

01:28.084 --> 01:29.984
Happiness...

01:30.713 --> 01:32.492
I think I'm happy.

01:32.828 --> 01:35.247
It's funny, cos a lot of people go,

01:35.248 --> 01:38.248
"Karl's not happy. He's a right
miserable bastard."

01:38.448 --> 01:42.768
But I am really happy. It just that
I don't choose to...

01:42.908 --> 01:45.008
sort of show it, in a way.

01:45.168 --> 01:48.208
I don't see why you should. I don't
see why it's important to walk
around with a big grin on.

01:48.368 --> 01:50.908
I don't think smiling makes other
people smile.

01:50.988 --> 01:53.947
If you're a little bit pissed off,
and someone's walking around

01:53.948 --> 01:55.867
with a big smile on, it can annoy
you more.

01:55.868 --> 01:58.108
You're going, "Why are they so
happy? Why aren't I that happy?"

01:58.288 --> 02:01.488
So you're better off knocking about
with a right load of miserable bastards,

02:01.628 --> 02:05.308
and then you go, "God, my life's not
that bad. These lot are miserable."

02:29.008 --> 02:30.928
So, where are we starting, Karl?

02:31.088 --> 02:33.327
Going off to meet a tribe.

02:33.328 --> 02:35.068
Called the Raramuri tribe.

02:36.508 --> 02:39.248
And they get their happiness from
running.

02:40.168 --> 02:41.788
They get a lot of joy out of that.

02:42.268 --> 02:44.188
Did you never do cross-country as a
kid?

02:44.368 --> 02:46.588
No. They did it at school now and
again.

02:46.748 --> 02:49.147
It wasn't really cross-country cos
we didn't have any country.

02:49.148 --> 02:51.248
It was just sort of running through
town.

02:51.548 --> 02:53.548
And no-one took it seriously.

02:53.688 --> 02:57.327
My mam used to sort of say, "If
you're passing Sale Snips can you
get me some hair lacquer?"

02:57.328 --> 02:59.728
Stuff like that. It was basically
shopping whilst running.

03:00.688 --> 03:02.608
So what things did you do?

03:02.908 --> 03:05.168
Slapsies. Remember that?

03:05.548 --> 03:07.728
I remember that got my heart going.

03:08.528 --> 03:10.188
Cos you'd be going, this is going to
hurt.

03:10.248 --> 03:12.668
You had dead arm. That was another
game you played.

03:12.808 --> 03:19.087
It was like Ticky It, really, but instead of just
ticking, you'd batter someone in the arm.

03:19.088 --> 03:21.328
You had kids at school with massive
bruises and stuff.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.128
So that was exercise. Arm wrestling.

03:27.088 --> 03:29.168
That was really popular.

03:29.688 --> 03:31.868
Arm wrestling in the '80s.

03:39.388 --> 03:42.288
Karl. All right? OK.

03:44.048 --> 03:45.968
Yeah? Let's do it.

03:46.048 --> 03:48.528
One, two, three...

03:57.328 --> 03:59.068
Jesus Christ.

04:22.768 --> 04:24.528
We've got another one for you.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.368
It's not going!

04:30.928 --> 04:31.688
Get down, you shit!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.568
Yes!

04:39.248 --> 04:41.328
That is not a bog-standard
11-year-old, I can tell you.

04:41.408 --> 04:43.388
Definitely not.

04:56.048 --> 04:57.968
Lorenzo. Hola.

04:58.128 --> 05:00.508
You well? Good? Que bueno. Si.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.128
Outfit.

05:06.179 --> 05:08.279
I'll pop this on, then, come see
you.

05:15.919 --> 05:19.299
Do you have to film this bit? Just
of me in my underpants, everyone
laughing at me?

05:19.639 --> 05:21.699
What are you filming this for?

05:22.639 --> 05:24.279
What are these made out of?

05:25.079 --> 05:27.159
Track tyres.
Tyres?

05:27.599 --> 05:31.439
So is it right that you use the
running to get happiness in your life?

05:33.239 --> 05:34.979
Yes, that's the attraction.

05:36.559 --> 05:39.959
This is a handcrafted wooden ball
that they kick around.

05:41.239 --> 05:43.479
I didn't realise it was a... This is
like football.

05:44.259 --> 05:46.019
Apparently there's a stick, Karl.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.719
I can't keep up with these rules. I
thought it was just running.

05:50.519 --> 05:53.819
If you win you get the goat. Useless
to me, innit?

05:53.839 --> 05:58.839
What use is that to me? You know what's going
to happen to it if they win, don't you?

06:00.919 --> 06:02.519
They're going to kill it.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.659
So I'm playing to save a goat's
life.

06:12.119 --> 06:14.359
These shoes hurt me a bit, you know.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.139
It's starting.

06:19.539 --> 06:21.559
Has it kicked off?

06:21.699 --> 06:23.599
It's started, Karl.

06:23.679 --> 06:25.559
Shit.

06:27.799 --> 06:29.858
Now they've passed.

06:29.859 --> 06:31.799
There's two games going... There's
two balls.

06:33.399 --> 06:35.459
Why is there two balls?

06:40.339 --> 06:41.839
Fuck's sake...

06:43.319 --> 06:45.160
They just shot off. There's no
starting pistol.

06:45.239 --> 06:49.139
No-one says, "Are you ready?" I need
to know the rule.

06:49.199 --> 06:51.139
These are really aching now.

06:54.799 --> 06:56.919
These shoes are fucking killing me.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.159
I've cut my toes, I've got blisters
now weeping.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.519
Want my boots?

07:03.119 --> 07:05.219
What size are your socks, though?

07:05.539 --> 07:07.379
Socks as well.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.479
A stick! I don't know what's
happening.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.039
Was he part of the game, or have I
just been mugged?

07:18.819 --> 07:20.919
I'm gonna win this.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.459
See you at the winning line.

07:25.539 --> 07:27.458
I'm winning this. I'm gonna leg it.

07:27.459 --> 07:29.699
Absolutely leg it.

07:40.199 --> 07:42.359
They feel heavy.

07:48.214 --> 07:50.314
I've done no preparation for this,
have I?

07:50.974 --> 07:53.374
You keep going as long as they do.
You don't have to run it.

07:54.154 --> 07:57.534
I can do... Don't be thinking I've
given up.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.754
I'm tired, but I'll do it till the
end.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.633
Really? Yes.

08:02.634 --> 08:05.053
It's the running, it's the race bit
I don't like.

08:05.054 --> 08:07.593
I'll do it in my own pace like I
like to do everything in life,

08:07.594 --> 08:09.533
and that's what you should do.

08:09.534 --> 08:13.374
You only get one go at it, don't
you? That's what makes me happy,
doing things at my own pace.

08:13.674 --> 08:15.273
That's the way things should be
done.

08:15.274 --> 08:20.074
That's happiness. I'm not arsed about what
position they're in, and where the ball is.

08:20.574 --> 08:23.134
The ball went off there earlier. He
went down trying to save it.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.853
What are they playing at?

08:25.854 --> 08:29.534
What are they doing? They're living
in houses that haven't got roofs on yet.

08:29.694 --> 08:33.693
Why aren't they sorting that out instead
of wasting energy looping round there?

08:33.693 --> 08:36.234
They've got wife and kids. It's
going to piss it down in a bit.

08:36.313 --> 08:40.234
It's thundering. They'll be piss-wet
through. "Where's Dad? Why hasn't
Dad put a roof on?"

08:40.374 --> 08:43.214
"He's chasing a wooden ball, son.
He's barmy."

08:49.872 --> 08:52.272
Is he smiling? I'm not getting to
see the face.

08:52.452 --> 08:54.371
I've only seen backs of heads.

08:54.372 --> 08:56.292
I can't keep up with them.

09:00.292 --> 09:02.372
Look how much they run here. What?

09:05.732 --> 09:07.412
Have you ever worn out a trainer
like that?

09:08.592 --> 09:11.272
People shouldn't be running the
distances they're doing.

09:12.032 --> 09:14.372
It's not normal. When are you going
to stop?

09:14.532 --> 09:18.372
Why do you keep asking me that? Do
you want me to stop?

09:19.152 --> 09:22.052
I just thought you'd give up. Stop
asking when I'm stopping.

09:22.512 --> 09:24.793
You want to stop, that's what this
is about. YOU'RE tired.

09:28.432 --> 09:30.912
God knows why they're running about
when they've got this here.

09:31.332 --> 09:33.892
I'd just be happy sat there, me.

09:37.792 --> 09:41.552
There's another shoe! How many shoes
do they get through in a week?

09:46.292 --> 09:48.132
Feel that. It's like a little lava
lamp.

09:53.872 --> 09:55.792
He did a really good job.

09:56.412 --> 10:00.032
They're finishing now. He's wondering
if he could do one lap more to win.

10:00.612 --> 10:02.852
I win the goat? Si.

10:02.992 --> 10:04.771
What will they get if I'm getting
the goat?

10:04.772 --> 10:07.332
Happiness. Happiness?

10:07.712 --> 10:09.692
All right, then, yeah. It's a deal.

10:20.932 --> 10:24.452
I suppose the lesson is, if any sort
of...

10:25.572 --> 10:29.252
..Raramuris sort of move to England,

10:29.412 --> 10:31.332
and they knock on your door and say,

10:31.432 --> 10:35.972
"I'm doing a sponsored walk. Will
you sponsor me?" don't be caught out.

10:36.612 --> 10:38.672
Have to take a mortgage out.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.412
Pretty chuffed with the distance I
did.

10:58.352 --> 11:02.531
That's about it. I'm not going to
start saying I feel amazing, all that.

11:02.532 --> 11:05.411
It's quite good I did that.

11:05.412 --> 11:07.392
I didn't give up.

11:07.532 --> 11:09.732
Come on, come on.

11:10.192 --> 11:12.572
Jesus, it's as strong as that
11-year-old kid.

11:13.392 --> 11:16.431
I don't know, really, about the
happiness side,

11:16.432 --> 11:19.552
because they have to go for so long,
don't they, to get it?

11:19.772 --> 11:24.131
I can do something really quick and
simple at home like just having a
lemon muffin from a cafe.

11:24.132 --> 11:26.372
That is a little bit of happiness.

11:26.452 --> 11:29.892
It's a bit of a walk down the road, but I can
be there and back in about eight minutes.

11:30.052 --> 11:32.112
They've got to be running for 12
hours.

11:36.132 --> 11:37.872
Might bolt in a minute, this.

11:45.332 --> 11:48.232
It was nice having a goat, you know?
That was a nice little moment.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.551
But then that started sort
of... outside.

11:52.552 --> 11:54.772
I thought, you're having a laugh.

11:54.912 --> 11:57.172
I've been walking about for hours to
save you, and now you keep me up all night.

11:57.332 --> 11:59.232
No wonder they got shot of it.

12:00.532 --> 12:02.452
A goat with Tourette's.

12:02.632 --> 12:04.552
Baaa!

12:33.367 --> 12:38.127
Hector. Have you ever got any joy
and happiness from pain?

12:38.173 --> 12:40.973
From pain? Pain, it hurts.

12:41.015 --> 12:43.155
Yeah. I don't see any happiness
right there.

12:43.275 --> 12:46.175
What's the most painful pain you've
ever had?

12:46.495 --> 12:48.915
Like, my kidney stones. I had kidney
stones.

12:49.055 --> 12:51.755
I had kidney stones. Bad, innit?
Painful!

12:51.915 --> 12:54.815
I couldn't even walk. No, I know.
You wanna cry. Yeah, I wanna cry.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.194
What did they do? Did you have an
operation, or did you -

12:58.195 --> 13:02.015
No, no, I just... Pissed them out. I
just pissed them out, that's it.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.395
Imagine pissing out a stone.

13:05.455 --> 13:07.314
It's like your nob turns into a
little whistle.

13:07.315 --> 13:09.235
With a little pea in it.

13:10.932 --> 13:13.172
Agony.

13:15.206 --> 13:16.646
See you later.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.081
Just looking at you, I can you've
messed about with your head.

13:24.241 --> 13:26.781
What have you done to your tongue?
Have you seen that?

13:26.861 --> 13:28.721
That's like alien.

13:28.881 --> 13:30.781
Or is it triffid?

13:32.481 --> 13:34.481
What do you mean?

13:34.641 --> 13:36.400
That's stupid.

13:36.401 --> 13:38.081
Are you ill? They're like tumours.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.961
Fuck me. Does that hurt?

13:44.401 --> 13:47.201
So, why, then? I don't understand
why you'd want that.

13:49.361 --> 13:51.440
Is there no other hobby you could
do?

13:51.441 --> 13:53.201
Art, painting...?

13:53.361 --> 13:55.101
There are other things to do in
life.

13:56.701 --> 13:58.941
Are you?

13:59.021 --> 14:00.561
Do you have to turn up in court?

14:08.701 --> 14:11.741
Do you know when you go to
supermarkets, and need £1 for the trolley?

14:11.821 --> 14:14.001
Never got one on you.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.421
Put them there. Cos your lobes do
nothing, do they?

14:17.841 --> 14:19.961
No use for a lobe.

14:25.201 --> 14:27.021
Suspension? What's suspension?

14:37.261 --> 14:39.581
I don't want to look at it.

14:43.601 --> 14:45.481
Has it gone in?

14:45.561 --> 14:47.721
Oh, my God!

14:47.781 --> 14:49.981
He didn't even flinch.

14:52.721 --> 14:54.781
Oy, oy, oy!

14:59.121 --> 15:01.661
Look at him. Look at his face.

15:02.941 --> 15:04.861
His feet... He's gotta fall off.

15:22.941 --> 15:24.981
Karl, you can see this.

15:25.001 --> 15:26.961
Look at that for a family photo.

15:29.201 --> 15:31.161
Oh, look at that - in the knee.
Right in the knee.

15:37.581 --> 15:39.741
We've had the Iron Age, the Stone
Age...

15:39.921 --> 15:41.821
This is the pissing about age.

15:44.241 --> 15:46.141
Let's get going. Can we just leave,
please?

15:46.221 --> 15:48.220
I've had enough of this.

15:48.221 --> 15:51.081
Once they've all had a few drinks
an' that, there's a load of them.

15:51.261 --> 15:53.201
There's only a few of us. I can
imagine.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.241
I'll be dangling up there.

15:57.299 --> 15:59.079
By the bollocks.

16:01.479 --> 16:04.039
Pulling that hair there next to your
ear, that hurts, doesn't it?

16:04.199 --> 16:06.979
Pulling at that. Pulling a long hair
out of your nose...

16:07.219 --> 16:09.159
I do that now and again when you
find it.

16:09.319 --> 16:12.999
That's a big build-up. I hate having
to do it, but it's got to be done.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.719
You feel it moving about, and you
pull it, and your eyes water.

16:17.099 --> 16:19.878
When you have a Kit Kat, and a bit
of foil's left on it, and you don't know,

16:19.879 --> 16:21.799
and it hits the filling at the back
of your head.

16:21.959 --> 16:25.138
Banging your toe on the corner of the
bed, they're all things that I do a lot.

16:25.139 --> 16:26.919
I never go, "That was nice."

16:28.579 --> 16:30.499
I don't like pain.

16:34.899 --> 16:37.319
If he watches like Jesus of Nazareth
or something,

16:37.479 --> 16:39.558
when Jesus is getting nailed to the
Cross,

16:39.559 --> 16:41.459
does he sort of go, "Oh, lucky
bastard!"

17:08.819 --> 17:12.039
The problem with trying to make
other people happy is,

17:12.118 --> 17:15.718
you don't know if that thing you're
doing that's meant to make them happy

17:15.719 --> 17:18.117
is going to make them happy - it
might piss them off.

17:18.118 --> 17:20.678
I always remember when Suzanne made
me a fish pie.

17:20.679 --> 17:22.759
Actually made it. Wasn't out of a
box.

17:23.319 --> 17:27.539
But it was horrible, so there's an
act that she did

17:27.618 --> 17:30.879
that was meant to be a nice thing,
but it wasn't.

17:32.019 --> 17:34.599
And I told her. I said, "Jesus,
that's horrible.

17:34.759 --> 17:38.119
It's rank, that." Did you tell her
it was rank? Yes.

17:38.259 --> 17:41.919
I think you've got to make someone
aware that it really is horrible.

17:42.119 --> 17:47.538
Don't make that again. That's the
worst thing you've ever made.

17:47.539 --> 17:50.579
And she still talks about it now. It
was about 15 years ago, that.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.519
How long had she spent making the
fish pie?

17:52.579 --> 17:54.919
Doesn't matter. None of that
matters, Ben.

17:55.079 --> 17:57.318
It doesn't matter if it took her
three days - it was shit.

17:57.319 --> 18:01.139
If it took her half an hour, it was
still shit. I didn't like it.

18:11.779 --> 18:13.799
All right?

18:25.619 --> 18:27.359
Do you get happiness out of it?

18:29.639 --> 18:31.559
And what is the dance?

18:36.719 --> 18:38.258
Let's do it.

18:38.259 --> 18:40.199
One, two...

18:40.359 --> 18:42.279
three.

18:45.439 --> 18:47.078
No.

18:47.079 --> 18:49.159
I've never even heard of krumping
till today.

18:49.299 --> 18:51.079
I have crumpets.

18:51.719 --> 18:53.619
It's like a pancake.

19:44.119 --> 19:45.298
Cake.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.539
Relaxing.

19:55.799 --> 19:57.859
Part of that, were you?

20:29.319 --> 20:31.079
I'm going to dance... Oh.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.539
It's good.

21:17.679 --> 21:19.719
I think there's something in it.

21:19.819 --> 21:22.739
I wasn't doing it for everyone else.
I was just doing it for myself.

21:23.719 --> 21:27.398
The whole thing about Tommy is that
he's helping people get happy.

21:27.399 --> 21:30.119
He's helping me, though. He's
helping me get happy.

21:30.279 --> 21:33.639
And if other people like my moves,

21:33.959 --> 21:34.859
fine.

21:35.079 --> 21:37.039
If they don't, there's not much I
can do about it.

21:37.059 --> 21:39.039
That's what I said to him, though.

21:39.219 --> 21:43.379
As well as making people happy, I'm
sure there's some people get pissed off.

21:43.539 --> 21:45.618
I tell you, my dad used to work
nights.

21:45.619 --> 21:48.199
If Tommy turned up in the avenue,
he'd go apeshit.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.039
He used to get annoyed with the
ice-cream man.

21:52.139 --> 21:54.279
He was only there for about two
minutes.

21:55.719 --> 21:57.778
You're never going to please
everyone.

21:57.779 --> 21:59.980
Why did Suzanne get annoyed when she
made that fish pie?

22:00.679 --> 22:03.559
She had a go at it, but I said I
didn't like it.

22:03.719 --> 22:05.959
She should have just enjoyed having
a go at making it.

22:06.079 --> 22:10.719
And that's what I did today - I sort
of enjoyed having a go at, you know,

22:10.919 --> 22:12.839
being KP the Clown.

22:22.539 --> 22:26.599
It's the first thing I've done on
this sort of journey of finding happiness

22:26.759 --> 22:28.759
that I thought, "I get it."

22:28.801 --> 22:31.981
Loads of people dance. It's been
around for years.

22:32.141 --> 22:35.200
Tribes done it, insects do it.

22:35.201 --> 22:38.081
Insects? Yes, insects have a dance.

22:38.221 --> 22:40.221
If you watch these nature
programmes, you see them.

22:41.101 --> 22:44.960
Spiders do it, some really good moves,
cos they've got eight legs, haven't they?

22:44.961 --> 22:49.961
So they're kind of doing like a moonwalk
with the other one doing
a bit of sort of popping.

22:49.965 --> 22:52.705
Honestly, You Tube it, have a look
at the footage.

22:52.711 --> 22:54.951
It's amazing. Proper, proper
dancing.

23:19.037 --> 23:23.017
If you think of people who love
themselves, take care of their body,

23:23.896 --> 23:26.136
LA is definitely up there, innit?

23:27.803 --> 23:30.662
Everyone's after that same weird
look.

23:30.663 --> 23:34.683
That Botox thing with no lines on
their face, and...

23:34.823 --> 23:36.923
They're not happy in their own skin,
are they?

23:37.643 --> 23:39.623
Do you feel happy in your skin?

23:39.803 --> 23:42.843
It's all I know. I don't wanna say I
hate this skin.

23:43.003 --> 23:45.503
I want someone else's, and when you
put it on it's all baggy.

23:45.523 --> 23:48.763
You're like Gordon Ramsay. It's all
flaps and folds.

23:48.843 --> 23:51.963
The only thing that's got the right to say
they're not happy in their skin is a pug.

23:52.123 --> 23:55.603
A pug dog. That's the only thing
that you go, "What has gone on there?"

24:07.303 --> 24:08.602
Justin.

24:08.603 --> 24:09.963
Hey, Karl.

24:10.003 --> 24:12.442
So what have you had done, then?

24:12.443 --> 24:16.602
I guess I've had 120 procedures
right along there right now.

24:16.603 --> 24:19.623
So I've done cheeks, lips, chin,
pec implants, bicep implants,

24:19.803 --> 24:21.763
tricep implants and the delts.

24:22.843 --> 24:25.402
The end result has really made me a
happier person,

24:25.403 --> 24:27.322
a better person.

24:27.323 --> 24:30.202
But you must have had a starting
point, whereas with me

24:30.203 --> 24:31.543
what could I do, really?

24:31.603 --> 24:34.843
Look at that for... Can you do that?

24:34.923 --> 24:36.922
Can you do that? I can't, actually.

24:36.923 --> 24:39.523
I'm trying to do it now. They lift,
right, but they don't wrinkle.

24:39.543 --> 24:42.503
Isn't that what the face is for?
Expression?

24:42.663 --> 24:46.523
It's a form of language. You don't
have to paralyse everything.

24:46.583 --> 24:49.882
Why don't you come with me today?
I'm going to go see Nurse Jamie.

24:49.883 --> 24:53.323
I was going to talk to her about some of the
procedures, maybe do a little maintenance.

24:53.543 --> 24:56.102
Yeah. I'm probably not going to have
anything, cos...

24:56.103 --> 24:58.022
I don't know where to start.

24:58.023 --> 24:59.783
You have to do something. Honestly.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.283
I heard that she does something called
ball ironing, or something like this.

25:04.383 --> 25:07.802
It's like a re-servicing of your
scrotum.

25:07.803 --> 25:10.042
There's a call for that?

25:10.043 --> 25:14.203
If you're worrying about the wrinkles on your
bollocks, I'd say your life's pretty good.

25:14.283 --> 25:18.503
I haven't even got an iron, do you
know that? I haven't got an iron or
ironing board at home.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.122
Who's worrying about that?

25:20.123 --> 25:22.202
I guess you figure people do anal
bleaching -

25:22.203 --> 25:24.423
Anal bleaching?!

25:24.883 --> 25:26.843
Never heard of it.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.363
Never heard of that. My arse, I
don't know what colour it is.

25:30.523 --> 25:32.603
I don't know if it needs bleaching.

25:32.723 --> 25:36.423
Do you know, if you had five photos
of anuses, I could not point mine out.

25:38.363 --> 25:41.402
I just want to know what you
recommend.

25:41.403 --> 25:43.303
I don't want to have that sort of
look.

25:43.483 --> 25:46.362
It is good. I was saying to him, I
think it looks good.

25:46.363 --> 25:48.123
Right.

25:48.203 --> 25:50.203
But I don't want that.

25:51.163 --> 25:52.762
You have like a little bit of
redness in your skin,

25:52.763 --> 25:56.763
so I would maybe just tone that down
a little bit.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.462
These I don't like, because I think
they make us look sad.

25:59.463 --> 26:01.882
I don't even know what you're seeing
there, though.

26:01.883 --> 26:05.203
I think you're a handsome guy. I
think you've got the cake. Let's
just put some icing on it.

26:05.343 --> 26:07.163
I think you'll be fine.

26:09.543 --> 26:12.923
So there's no pain? There's no pain.
It actually feels good.

26:12.983 --> 26:15.163
All right, so, here's the first
little one.

26:16.583 --> 26:19.782
This is a big step, you know, cos
this morning I was kind of like,

26:19.783 --> 26:21.883
"I don't need any of this, I don't
need it."

26:22.843 --> 26:24.923
I can see a difference already. That
looks pretty good, I think.

26:25.063 --> 26:28.123
I think it does too. Have you
changed the lighting in here?

26:28.283 --> 26:33.063
No. No, honestly, there's a kind of
a glow there. A fresher glow.

26:33.143 --> 26:36.603
You definitely need something more,
but I think it looks better, for sure.

26:36.763 --> 26:40.703
If you want some more, do some more.
Let's do some more. Fill your boots.

26:42.263 --> 26:44.103
How old do you think I am?

26:44.183 --> 26:46.683
I don't know. How old are you? Go
on.

26:46.763 --> 26:48.763
No, how old are you? You tell me.

26:49.563 --> 26:51.623
40. 40? Yeah.

26:51.703 --> 26:53.722
I think you're a handsome guy. Yeah?

26:53.723 --> 26:55.483
Yeah.

26:57.723 --> 27:00.442
Whoa, what's that? I can smell
burning.

27:00.443 --> 27:02.363
That shouldn't be... I'll let you
live.

27:03.763 --> 27:05.703
Now can you tell?

27:05.883 --> 27:10.362
Yeah. Can you fill that? Can you
fill that line there, cos that looks
like the Nile or something.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.423
OK, I can do that.

27:13.223 --> 27:15.803
That wrinkly head has always
bothered me.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.683
I've said to you before, it looks
like an elephant's knee.

27:18.843 --> 27:23.603
There was a fancy dress party at
school, and my mam said I should
have gone as a walnut.

27:24.923 --> 27:27.163
Serious now, this.

27:27.483 --> 27:29.303
Are they going in now?

27:29.363 --> 27:31.483
Yeah. Ay!

27:32.423 --> 27:34.163
Oh, what was that?

27:34.363 --> 27:36.582
It's a whole new, like, device going
on now.

27:36.583 --> 27:38.523
Do you even know what you're
getting?

27:38.663 --> 27:41.783
No, but that's what Jamie's about,
innit?

27:42.203 --> 27:44.903
This is the bloodless vampire.
Bloodless vampire?

27:46.983 --> 27:49.723
Do you know how much you spent?
£2,500.

27:49.803 --> 27:52.283
Fuck off!

27:53.563 --> 27:55.803
Seriously? Two and a half grand?!

27:57.083 --> 27:59.803
I love you, Karl. You're awesome.

28:00.423 --> 28:02.343
Welcome to the dark side.

28:02.423 --> 28:04.763
Do you feel a bit happier?

28:07.143 --> 28:09.083
Yeah, I do, actually.

28:09.703 --> 28:11.942
I do. I look pretty good.

28:11.943 --> 28:15.623
I think it was all about having Jamie
saying, "Oh, yeah, you're looking
pretty hot."

28:16.283 --> 28:18.023
You've got nice eyes.

28:18.903 --> 28:20.923
That's probably my best feature,
that.

28:21.083 --> 28:23.803
I haven't had that happen. No-one's
said that to me for years.

28:23.963 --> 28:27.163
So that's why I enjoy it. I don't
even know if I do.

28:27.323 --> 28:29.703
But having, you know, quite a sexy
woman...

28:30.263 --> 28:32.582
saying, "You're looking hot", and
all that...

28:32.583 --> 28:35.003
She was all over me, and honestly,

28:35.083 --> 28:36.983
I think that was what I enjoyed.

28:37.243 --> 28:41.222
Is that bad? I don't know if I look
any different, honestly!

28:41.223 --> 28:45.543
It's not that much, but I quite
enjoyed having her rubbing my face.

28:45.963 --> 28:47.963
Right, let's get back in.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.323
I'm going to go and get my arse
done.

29:12.443 --> 29:15.622
At the moment, I feel quite good
about stuff.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.002
The weather's nice, my face is
looking better than it's ever done.

29:19.003 --> 29:22.043
So to go in here and get angry
doesn't feel...

29:22.103 --> 29:24.123
real, do you know what I mean?

29:24.263 --> 29:27.063
I've got nothing to worry about. I
don't lash out.

29:27.303 --> 29:30.502
I like to moan. Happens all the time
at home.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.283
But Suzanne just puts up with it.

29:32.423 --> 29:35.482
I might be sat on the toilet, and
I'd turn round and see that

29:35.483 --> 29:38.523
she's bought a bottle of bleach
that's eco-friendly.

29:38.603 --> 29:43.143
I go down, and I'll moan to her. "That eco-friendly
bleach, it don't do anything. It's weak.

29:43.323 --> 29:47.163
It's like mouthwash. I left a stain. You
moan at me that I shouldn't leave stains.

29:47.323 --> 29:49.883
I've left a stain." And then she
goes on about saving the planet.

29:49.943 --> 29:52.903
It's bollocks. It's not saving any
planet. You've been ripped off.

29:52.983 --> 29:56.923
"It's better for dolphins." "It
doesn't matter. We haven't got
dolphins in London, so don't worry."

29:57.063 --> 29:59.482
It's shit, and then that's it - it's
gone.

29:59.483 --> 30:03.863
It's gone. That's been that little release.
I've forgot about the bleach 30 seconds later.

30:03.923 --> 30:06.503
It doesn't matter. I've moved on.

30:09.723 --> 30:11.463
Yeah!

30:23.723 --> 30:25.563
Yeah!

30:25.623 --> 30:29.243
Hi, Karl. How are you? Welcome to
Anger Room.

30:30.683 --> 30:32.922
So what's her problem? What's wrong
with her?

30:32.923 --> 30:35.483
I'm afraid she has a problem with
printers.

30:35.563 --> 30:37.543
And office equipment.

30:39.483 --> 30:42.023
Seriously? That's what it is? She
doesn't like office...

30:42.203 --> 30:45.243
She doesn't like office equipment.
Bit of an extreme reaction, though.

30:45.403 --> 30:47.323
It's normally just a paper jam,
innit?

30:47.483 --> 30:50.483
Our goal here is to tear it up so
you can't use it any more.

30:50.683 --> 30:54.202
So do you think she is really
getting rid of anger at the moment?

30:54.203 --> 30:58.163
I really believe she is, because a
lot of people pent up their anger,

30:58.343 --> 31:02.343
and stress, so they may go home
after work, and you'd think they
forgot about it,

31:02.523 --> 31:05.723
but they really didn't, because it's
in the back of their mind.

31:05.863 --> 31:07.503
Do you have something that you don't
like?

31:08.043 --> 31:11.463
Um... Not like that.

31:14.203 --> 31:17.222
So what are you two here for? What's
been winding you up?

31:17.223 --> 31:19.163
Just life in general, right now.

31:19.223 --> 31:22.522
And what would you do if you didn't
have this place to come and smash
shit up?

31:22.523 --> 31:26.363
How would you get rid of that anger?
Just bottle it up.

31:26.443 --> 31:29.843
There's nothing you can do like this
to get it out, without getting in
trouble anyways.

31:30.243 --> 31:32.603
Let's have a look.

31:33.403 --> 31:35.463
It's like a really shit raffle.
Yeah!

31:35.643 --> 31:38.343
Do you have raffles here? You've
kind of got a coffee maker,

31:38.523 --> 31:40.102
Wi-Fi...

31:40.103 --> 31:41.403
What's that?

31:41.543 --> 31:44.123
I'm a big fan of watching Bullseye
with Jim Bowen.

31:44.243 --> 31:46.263
That was like the prizes.

31:46.503 --> 31:48.823
They were all right. They had a DVD
player,

31:48.887 --> 31:50.807
coffee machine...

31:50.967 --> 31:54.346
satellite box, and here's what you
could have won - car.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.867
The problem I've got with smashing
it up, it's a nice-looking car that.

31:57.067 --> 31:59.927
Put the hammer straight through the
window. Just knock it out.

32:00.107 --> 32:04.426
Just bust it through. I really wish
I was really annoyed about
something.

32:04.427 --> 32:07.287
Hit the bloody - No, I could. I
could just hit it.

32:07.447 --> 32:11.606
Yeah? But I think you have to really
get into...

32:11.607 --> 32:13.546
the zone for this to work.

32:13.547 --> 32:15.427
There's no point just going apeshit.

32:16.887 --> 32:19.767
Do you have people calling you over
here asking if you want your PPI
back?

32:19.987 --> 32:23.286
Right when you're eating dinner with
your family is when they want to
talk.

32:23.287 --> 32:25.527
Yeah. That's the car they drive.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.946
They drive that car.

32:27.947 --> 32:31.786
It's some sort of payment protection
plan.

32:31.787 --> 32:33.387
PPI.

32:33.627 --> 32:35.607
Pr... What is it? Uh...

32:36.247 --> 32:37.367
PPI...

32:37.527 --> 32:41.227
Stop calling me, cos I don't want my
PPI!

32:45.047 --> 32:47.126
Payment protection...

32:47.127 --> 32:48.147
Insurance.

32:48.407 --> 32:49.546
Insurance.

32:49.547 --> 32:52.906
Yeah. Payment protection insurance.
That's what it is.

32:52.907 --> 32:54.347
All right?

32:54.467 --> 32:57.226
Got my mates here. I think they want
their PPI back.

32:57.227 --> 33:00.147
Why don't you ask them? Why don't
you ask them if they want their PPI
back?

33:00.207 --> 33:02.147
Eh?

33:10.747 --> 33:14.667
It's not for me. I didn't get
happiness.

33:14.727 --> 33:18.407
When I'm annoyed, I have to release
it at that point.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.727
I can't sort of go, "I won't get
annoyed now.

33:20.987 --> 33:23.627
I'll save it till later, and smash a
gnome up when I'm home in the
garden."

33:23.787 --> 33:25.367
It doesn't work like that.

33:25.447 --> 33:27.447
I moan a lot. I do moan.

33:27.947 --> 33:30.987
That's... You know, but that's kind
of, that's my release.

33:31.127 --> 33:33.227
And people listen to you when you
complain?

33:33.787 --> 33:39.307
I don't think that's important. I'm
almost not bothered about them
hearing it, as long as I can...

33:39.387 --> 33:41.347
release it, have a moan.

33:42.807 --> 33:44.807
Have a moan. It's good for you.

33:45.047 --> 33:47.747
Release it at that moment. Get it
out.

33:47.800 --> 33:51.000
It's like gas, innit? Fart, let it
out.

34:17.230 --> 34:19.570
I'm meeting a bloke called Daniel
Suelo.

34:19.612 --> 34:21.692
He thinks that money doesn't make
you happy.

34:22.192 --> 34:24.112
It just gives you more stress.

34:24.592 --> 34:27.772
It's a nice idea, but I don't think
it's possible.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.625
If you decided to do it, would
Suzanne join you?

34:32.225 --> 34:34.925
Not a chance. Not a chance.

34:35.696 --> 34:39.795
She gets pissed off if we stay in a
B and B, and there isn't a hairdryer
in the drawer.

34:39.876 --> 34:41.716
That's roughing it for her.

34:45.396 --> 34:49.215
I'm just keen to see how he does it,
and how happy he is.

34:49.216 --> 34:55.795
I can't imagine enjoying life, cos
I'd constantly be worried about the
next meal.

34:55.795 --> 34:57.555
Here he is.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.636
Daniel?

35:01.056 --> 35:02.816
Did we say two or one?

35:02.996 --> 35:04.976
Ben told me it was meant to be one
o'clock.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.956
I'm sorry. I thought it was two. All
right. No problem.

35:09.856 --> 35:13.536
Some granola, and this is kind of a
trail mix.

35:13.616 --> 35:17.196
I only got into it, you know, about
a year ago.

35:17.276 --> 35:19.955
Never had it before. Oh, yeah?

35:19.956 --> 35:23.856
So, what is the plan? What are we
gonna do today?

35:23.916 --> 35:26.995
We could go check out where I get
food.

35:26.996 --> 35:29.036
All the food I have, I find.

35:29.116 --> 35:31.236
Or somebody gives it to me.

35:31.336 --> 35:33.375
Where did you find granola?

35:33.376 --> 35:35.456
It was a dumpster.

35:38.676 --> 35:41.876
So, do you want to just explain to
me what you're playing at?

35:42.016 --> 35:44.116
I gave up money 13 years ago

35:44.276 --> 35:46.335
because I was tired of the rat race.

35:46.336 --> 35:49.076
It was about finding balance, and
living in the present,

35:49.216 --> 35:51.156
which is about being content and
happy.

35:52.596 --> 35:54.676
What is this? A pizza place? Yeah.

36:00.596 --> 36:02.196
Seriously?!

36:02.356 --> 36:04.736
Did you put them there? No, this is
the way it is.

36:06.036 --> 36:08.436
There's more in there too. That is
mad.

36:08.556 --> 36:12.595
I don't understand, though, Daniel,
why they're in boxes, and they've
got paper on them.

36:12.596 --> 36:16.095
It seems too convenient. It's what
happens when people order pizzas,

36:16.096 --> 36:18.655
and then they've not come, so they
throw them out.

36:18.656 --> 36:22.036
That happens all the time. Is that a
pineapple one? Yeah.

36:22.156 --> 36:24.076
Can I have a piece of that? Yeah.

36:24.276 --> 36:26.176
Are you sure, Karl?

36:28.116 --> 36:29.876
I mean, that's even my choice of
pizza, that.

36:30.036 --> 36:31.956
Oh, yeah? Really? It's not bad.

36:32.656 --> 36:34.816
Do they have any pudding?

36:35.296 --> 36:37.236
I can't believe how much is in
there.

36:37.396 --> 36:41.236
I thought you meant bits of food
half-eaten, and... No.

36:41.396 --> 36:43.156
That's the way it is all over the
country.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.416
Did you need sleeping gear?

36:46.476 --> 36:48.596
I was relying on you, to be honest.

36:49.216 --> 36:51.456
There's a three-piece suite. Do you
need one of them?

36:52.576 --> 36:55.796
So this is how you find blankets,
sleeping bags...

36:55.956 --> 36:58.676
Yeah. It's amazing. I find really
good clothes.

37:00.016 --> 37:02.036
Oh yeah, you need a sport coat?

37:02.996 --> 37:04.636
I've not got one of them. There's
another.

37:06.196 --> 37:07.796
That's wool.

37:07.956 --> 37:10.096
Hey, look at that for a fitting!

37:10.796 --> 37:13.695
Yeah, looks grea... Whoa, you look
sharp.

37:13.696 --> 37:17.536
I tell you what, I was pretty cold.
This is all right.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.776
It looks good on you.

37:21.376 --> 37:23.316
Any money in the pockets?

37:23.936 --> 37:25.856
There's a whole turkey.

37:26.356 --> 37:29.036
If you can find a pudding, I'll be
amazed.

37:30.336 --> 37:32.736
How long have I been out? Probably
less than an hour.

37:32.896 --> 37:36.416
Less than an hour? I've got a new
jacket, and three 12-inch pizzas.

37:36.576 --> 37:38.675
That's pretty impressive.

37:38.676 --> 37:40.276
Innit?

37:41.076 --> 37:43.536
I just don't believe it. I don't
know why Bear Grylls

37:43.796 --> 37:46.116
is on the telly telling me how to
stab a camel in the head,

37:46.196 --> 37:48.276
and what bits to eat - what's he
doing?

37:48.436 --> 37:51.796
Why isn't Bear Grylls just wandering
around the back of Tesco?

37:52.596 --> 37:56.415
What's he found now? I did find a
Dutch apple pie.

37:56.416 --> 37:59.476
No, you haven't. Yeah, I got a pie.

38:03.756 --> 38:06.036
Let's have a little bit of the
crust.

38:08.756 --> 38:10.816
There's nothing wrong with that.
Have a bit of that.

38:11.316 --> 38:13.716
Ben, have a bit of that. There is
nothing wrong with it.

38:16.556 --> 38:18.516
Mm. We've got two courses.

38:18.576 --> 38:20.256
We're homeless.

38:22.976 --> 38:26.036
Sometimes I find people leave clothes
like this.

38:26.116 --> 38:29.056
Straight leg. Waist 34, length 32.

38:30.196 --> 38:32.276
They're a little wide, but with a
belt -

38:32.436 --> 38:35.315
I don't believe it. I don't believe
it, cos that's my size.

38:35.316 --> 38:37.216
Oh, yeah?

38:39.316 --> 38:41.196
I mean, that's never happened.

38:45.616 --> 38:47.476
They're pretty tasty. Yeah.

38:51.476 --> 38:57.235
If you see a homeless person, do you
see yourself in a different light
than that?

38:57.236 --> 39:00.256
Sometimes I look at them and think,
"There's a homeless person."

39:00.356 --> 39:04.416
I have to remind myself, "Oh, yeah,
I'm a homeless person."

39:10.096 --> 39:12.056
An experience.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.416
Living a day without having to spend
any money.

39:16.516 --> 39:19.116
What's that? It's a blanket.

39:19.296 --> 39:24.576
I suppose there's a little bit of me
that is like Dan in a way anyway.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.356
I mean, I used to do a lot of that
when I was a kid.

39:26.516 --> 39:29.236
I used to go out round the back of
Hagenbach's Bakery,

39:29.316 --> 39:32.255
eat cakes, fill my face.

39:32.256 --> 39:34.176
Do you want a pillow? Yeah, yeah,
definitely.

39:35.316 --> 39:37.396
Got a blanket and a pillow.

39:38.656 --> 39:40.576
Ready for home.

39:41.076 --> 39:43.717
So, what are you going to do
tonight? Are you going to stick it
out?

39:43.796 --> 39:45.716
Yeah.

39:46.816 --> 39:50.036
I dunno, though. It seems quite like
a place bears would hang out, this.

39:50.516 --> 39:53.236
What is it? Black bears are
dangerous, brown aren't?

39:54.676 --> 39:56.576
It's one or the other.

39:56.736 --> 40:00.096
I mean, as if anyway. Brown and
black, you couldn't get closer
colours.

40:00.276 --> 40:03.517
You're not gonna sit there and go,
"Is he brown? Is he black?" Just
fucking leg it.

40:06.016 --> 40:08.116
That rain's starting to come.

40:08.396 --> 40:10.416
It's been threatening all day.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.656
God, this is mad.

40:15.316 --> 40:17.396
It's not even a proper tent.

40:19.776 --> 40:22.175
Surely, though,

40:22.176 --> 40:25.396
I've enjoyed today, but when the
weather's like this

40:25.536 --> 40:28.095
you must sort of lie in here at
night if it's raining, and think,

40:28.096 --> 40:29.536
"What am I doing?"

40:29.676 --> 40:32.256
I actually love it in here like when
it's raining.

40:32.896 --> 40:35.456
I find it comforting, sleeping in the
rain.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.696
Do you?

40:37.876 --> 40:42.036
I dunno. I dunno now. This has just
swung it a bit for me.

40:42.656 --> 40:45.936
Have you got any more of this stuff
that can go over the gaps?

40:46.076 --> 40:48.096
No. Come on!

40:55.056 --> 40:57.076
Not gonna work, is it?

40:57.636 --> 40:59.476
Oh, I dunno.

40:59.596 --> 41:04.176
Where are you sleeping? The crew are
going back to that four-star hotel.

41:05.236 --> 41:08.496
I'm trying to work out what I'm
meant to be getting out of this
programme.

41:09.856 --> 41:11.756
You know, this whole trip, this
journey...

41:11.956 --> 41:17.056
What's it all about? It's about me
looking at happiness, and what makes
different people happy.

41:18.036 --> 41:20.256
I could do it. I could easily sleep
here.

41:21.156 --> 41:23.136
We've been in worse places.

41:23.216 --> 41:25.216
Hell of a lot worse, yeah.

41:26.016 --> 41:29.676
In fact, if you look at most of it,
it's all about comfort for me,
innit?

41:30.496 --> 41:33.556
The shoes, the running shoes that
the Raramuris gave me.

41:33.636 --> 41:35.296
They weren't comfy.

41:35.476 --> 41:37.556
My trainers are wet.

41:37.636 --> 41:39.476
Pain party. Definitely not comfort.

41:39.616 --> 41:41.376
They'll dry out.

41:41.456 --> 41:46.035
And now, you know, staying in a
tent, and I think...

41:46.036 --> 41:49.535
that's what makes me happy, at the
end of the day.

41:49.536 --> 41:51.955
Simple as that - bit of comfort.

41:51.956 --> 41:54.996
OK, I'm just as comfortable as Bill
Gates.

41:55.156 --> 41:57.616
No, you're not, honestly.

41:57.676 --> 42:01.396
I hate that thing when people say,
"Oh, he's got loads of money.

42:01.536 --> 42:05.076
Money doesn't make you happy."
Honestly, I bet he's happier than us
now.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.155
I bet you he is.

42:07.156 --> 42:11.476
So, tonight I'll go back to the
hotel, and I'll really...

42:12.116 --> 42:14.036
be over the moon with it.

42:14.196 --> 42:18.015
In fact, I probably won't go to
sleep straight away. I'm going to
lie in it, thinking how good it is.

42:18.016 --> 42:19.636
I'm not going to take it for
granted.

42:20.196 --> 42:22.676
I might even order room service.

42:22.836 --> 42:24.756
I'm not... I've...

42:24.876 --> 42:26.836
I've given in. Oh, yeah?

42:28.436 --> 42:30.516
Just sit in it. Ah!

42:32.436 --> 42:34.336
It's just making me happy thinking
about it.

42:34.676 --> 42:36.736
Big comfy pillows an' that.

42:37.376 --> 42:39.116
How good is that?!

42:39.296 --> 42:41.216
Oh!

42:41.376 --> 42:46.176
See, that means it's right, doesn't
it? I can't wait, honestly.

42:46.916 --> 42:48.696
I can't wait.

42:48.816 --> 42:54.316
Are you sure that you don't want me
to get you a room there for a night?

42:54.516 --> 42:58.016
Just think about it. Nice comfy bed.
Honestly, you haven't seen it.

42:58.196 --> 43:00.116
Really soft linen sheets.

43:00.276 --> 43:03.956
No, actually, I... I'm happy with
this.

43:04.596 --> 43:09.216
Well, if by some chance you're in the
hotel room, and you're like, "I wanna
go camp",

43:09.296 --> 43:10.976
you're welcome here.

43:11.136 --> 43:13.235
Yeah, all right, well, don't wait
up.

43:13.236 --> 43:15.156
All right. Nice to see you.

43:15.596 --> 43:17.996
Nice hotel!

43:18.976 --> 43:21.236
Have a good shit, all that granola
I've had.

43:38.676 --> 43:40.576
Karl?

43:41.536 --> 43:43.776
Are you happy? Well happy.

43:45.716 --> 43:47.616
See you later.
