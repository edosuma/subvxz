02:03.624 --> 02:06.260
And prison life
took some gettin' used to.

A typical day in prison
can be broken down
into several activities.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.335
First, you wake up and make sure
nothing's happened to your
two most important things.

Finally, it's time for bed.

[ All Sobbing ]

03:12.960 --> 03:16.997
The only thing that breaks
the routine is when one prisoner
tries to kill another.

But no matter what,
you still get punished.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.943
And everyone gets searched.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.349
Thoroughly searched.
Gigitty-goo!

03:35.383 --> 03:38.652
Not surprisingly,
prison was turning out
to be a miserable place.

03:38.686 --> 03:42.356
But the one bright spot
was visiting day, when I got to
see my friends.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.625
Some friends I got to see
more of than others.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.562
I don't think you realize what
you're doin' to these prisoners,
comin' in dressed like that.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.499
I don't like to change at work.
There's a new girl
who steals your pants...

03:51.532 --> 03:54.302
and then sells them back to you
at unreasonable prices.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.640
What do you

Oh, I'm not ready yet, Earl.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.543
You go ahead, Darnell.
Here you go, Earl.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.847
Sometimes incarcerated people
like yourself use their time in
prison to get closer with God.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.451
Those are some books
I found to be helpful on
my journey to find religion.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.886

04:34.875 --> 04:37.445
I just can't make it
give off his
angelic essence.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.813
I even stoled half this glass
from a church window.

04:39.847 --> 04:44.017
I like it. It looks exactly
like Earl would look if he was
made out of glass.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.387
Does it matter
if you like it, Darnell?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.323
Were you the shining hero that
sacrificed your freedom to save
me from a life in prison,

04:49.357 --> 04:51.425

a short-haired woman
named Trudy?

04:51.459 --> 04:53.761
This is not
good enough for Earl.

is you can't let people

the best way

The problem is, gangs in prison
are divided up like my dad's

what happened to you.

Yeah.

Can't believe you got two
years in prison for hittin'
a cop with an empty beer can.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.286
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, well, I also kind of
wrestled the cop's gun away,

11:59.319 --> 12:03.023
and then, you know, drove
around with him in the trunk
of his own car for a few hours.

It was a crazy day.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.394
How come this is
the first time I've seen you?

Because this is the first time
I wanted you to see me.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.267
[ Earl Narrating ] Turns out
Sonny figured out another way
to survive in prison:

12:14.301 --> 12:16.503
be invisible.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.039
And he agreed to teach me
how to do it.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.509
I learned things like
two fat guys sittin' on a bench
didn't have to be scary.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.512
They could also be
a nice shady place
to hide and play cards.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.388
Got in a fight, got more time,
got in another fight,
slimed a guard,

22:35.422 --> 22:37.957
tried to escape,
got out,

22:37.990 --> 22:41.628
stole something,
went back in, got out,

22:41.661 --> 22:43.730
robbed a mini-mall,
threw rocks at the mayor.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.633
Hell, if I think about it,
Earl, everything
I did was your fault.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.938
Well, I don't know
if you can really blame me
for everything.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.607
- I mean, personal choice
seems to have--
- Son of a bitch!

22:54.641 --> 22:57.677
I will twist your yam sack
like a balloon animal!

22:57.710 --> 23:00.012
Okay, okay!
You know, on second thought,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.715
I can see how you could
connect the dots like that.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.652
Look. How about I do
somethin' to make us even?

23:05.685 --> 23:08.120
Like, uh,

23:08.154 --> 23:11.057
I hear you like candy bars.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.594
I got some people
on the outside who could
track down a-- a Zagnut.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.599
Make me a shiv.
A shiv? Like a knife?

23:19.632 --> 23:24.571
Or like an ice pick.
Or an ax. Or a cheese slicer.
Surprise me.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.539
[ Earl Narrating ]
Generally I tried
not to break rules...

23:26.573 --> 23:28.641
in order to cross things
off my list.

23:28.675 --> 23:31.611
But I wasn't as worried
about my list as I was
about surviving.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.480
And besides,
I wasn't me anymore.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.649
I was prisoner
number 28301-016.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.851
Okay, a shiv it is.

if that TV show Riptide
is gonna be on tonight?

23:54.867 --> 23:58.104
I swear to God, Darnell.
I can't keep livin'
like this.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.973
That show hasn't been on
for 20 years.

24:01.007 --> 24:04.010
Oh. Then what's
the show I'm thinkin' of?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.145
You know,
the one with the monkey.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.048
- I think he means
B.J. and the Bear.
- Don't you dare tell him that.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.685
Once he knows,
he'll start tellin' us
about every episode.

24:12.719 --> 24:16.756
Oh, wait. I think it's
B.J. and the Bear.
Damn it.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.959
Remember the one
where they were drivin'
that semi together?

24:19.992 --> 24:23.996
[ Sighs ]
Okay. That's it.
This ends now.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.000
Push.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.172
Joy, why would B.J.
name his monkey Bear?

24:33.205 --> 24:36.776
Because B.J. was a huge Alabama
fan, and he named him after the
legendary coach Bear Bryant.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.011
You happy?
Now listen. We gotta talk.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.848
As you know,
I promised Earl I would
take care of you--

24:41.881 --> 24:44.216
- And I really
appreciate it, Joy.
- Not done yet.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.819
But after the last few days,
I've realized something.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.921
You're not just dumb.
You're broken.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.024
Like a daddy longlegs after
the kids pull his legs off.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.294
It's just a little
vibratin' ball that can't do
nothin' for itself. That's you.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.630
I'm a spider ball?

24:57.664 --> 25:00.700
Yeah. And you're a burden
to your brother. I could
babysit you for two years,

25:00.733 --> 25:03.135
but when Earl
gets out of prison,
you wouldn't be any better.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.672
And you don't want to be
albacore around your brother's
neck, do you?

25:05.705 --> 25:07.807
No.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.876
Is this because
I peed on the kids?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.244
It was the middle
of the night.
I took a wrong turn.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.681
It's because of
a lot of things, Randy.
Like...

25:14.714 --> 25:18.551
that dumb look you got
on your face all the time.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.053
Or the fact that...

25:21.087 --> 25:23.556
you think there's
a left sock and a right sock.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.292
But don't you worry.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.294
We're gonna work everything out,
startin' with this
late-night talkin'.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.534
Oh, you can't
breathe because of your
deviated septum, can you?

25:44.310 --> 25:47.313
I saw that on MASH. Night.

[ Randy Panting ]

26:00.092 --> 26:03.896
[ Earl Narrating ]
Since it was my first time in
the cage, I got out before Glen,

26:03.930 --> 26:07.900
who, from what I heard,
seemed to spend more time
in there than his cell.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.703
To survive in prison,
I needed to stay invisible.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.673
But I also needed
to get Glen a shiv.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.942
I was familiar with
the different types of shivs.

26:15.975 --> 26:20.112
There was the sharpened
toothbrush, the razor comb.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.683
There was the
Tighty-Whitey-Mighty-Fighty
somehow made out of underwear.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.185
There was even one
made out of soap.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.121
But the one made out of soap
had its downside.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.698
I decided I was gonna
make Glen's with an arm
from a pair of glasses.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.267
- I was gonna call it
the Peeper Reaper.
- How about you?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.369
Would you hate
Martin Luther King more
if he'd been Indian?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.674
Okay, yeah.
I'd hate him more
if he'd been Indian.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.343
Unless he was Cherokee.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.613
A Cherokee once saved
my black grandpa
from drowning.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.850
Oops.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.919
[ Earl Narrating ]
I was relieved...

26:59.952 --> 27:02.154
when a couple days later
Glen got out of the hotbox.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.290
Mostly 'cause I wanted him
out of my life.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.159
But also because
when you hide a shiv
in your pants for two days,

27:07.193 --> 27:09.228
you can't help
but have a few mishaps.
You got it?

27:15.401 --> 27:19.338
Nice.
Thanks. I made it out of
a pair of glasses.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.173
Sharpened it on the asphalt.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.743
Then I wrapped one of my socks
around it for a handle.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.145
You could stab all day
and not get a blister.

27:26.178 --> 27:30.216
[ Earl Narrating ] I hoped karma
would understand I had no choice
but to give Glen that shiv.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.427
After Glen stabbed me,
I realized two things.

27:41.460 --> 27:47.399
Until I did my list item right,
karma wasn't gonna let me
be invisible.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.803
- And prison
health care sucks.
- Okay. You're done.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.841
There may be some shiv left
in the bone, so if your arm
turns black, tell a guard.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.176
That was quite a shiv.
Thank you.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.482
Wow. That Glen's
got the worst luck.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.885
Excuse me?

28:05.918 --> 28:09.088
Every year,
when he's up for parole,
somebody pisses him off,

28:09.121 --> 28:11.357
and he breaks
one of the big seven.
The big seven?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.860
Things that keep you
from getting out.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.895
You know, stabbing, burning,
biting, strangling,

28:15.928 --> 28:19.899
eye-gouging, scalping
and taking a poop
in the urinal.

28:19.932 --> 28:24.904
Wait. So he messes up right
before parole every time?

28:24.937 --> 28:28.074
- Why would he do that?
- You know what I figured out
about prison?

There are a lot of guys
in here without clearly
thought-out plans.

Glen didn't want to
get out of prison,

28:33.145 --> 28:36.115
and I wanted to know why.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.986
And finally, after hours of
wandering, my fat guy walked
by the hotbox so I could ask.

what I should've done
the first time I saw Glen.

29:05.945 --> 29:10.416
I told him all about my list
and how he was on it. And how if
I was gonna be right with karma,

I had to do
somethin' better than a shiv

he was so worried
about surviving,
he changed the way he was...

33:23.435 --> 33:25.404
Anyway, uh, we need
someplace to dig,

33:25.437 --> 33:27.606
and I hear this
is the best spot,

33:27.639 --> 33:32.144
so I guess what I'm saying
is... I need a favor.

33:32.178 --> 33:36.348
Okay. We want umbrellas.
Eight of 'em.

Okay.

[ Earl Narrating ]
While I was puttin' my faith
in karma to keep me safe,

33:42.288 --> 33:45.457
Joy was puttin' her faith
in a different power:
tough love.

Tough love.

* And so

34:01.573 --> 34:06.078
[ Earl Narrating ] Joy had a lot
of faults, but she did have
a natural gift for teaching.

34:06.112 --> 34:10.316
* Because the past
is just a good-bye *

34:10.349 --> 34:14.120
And while Randy
may have been a slow learner,
Joy kept after him,

34:14.153 --> 34:16.255
teaching him things
he should've learned
a long time ago,

34:16.288 --> 34:18.590
like clothes you find
in the gutter might be free,

34:18.624 --> 34:20.659
but, well, they're probably
not disease-free.

Or how to make

communicate better.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.700

No, wait.
Uh, the crab claws.

34:31.637 --> 34:34.140
No.

34:34.173 --> 34:37.243
- How's the tuna salad?
- Not as good as
the chicken salad,

34:37.276 --> 34:40.212
but better than gettin'
smacked in the neck with
a big-ass rubber band.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.115
Hmm.

34:43.149 --> 34:46.218
Choose, dummy!
God, think for yourself!

turned into some gain.

Did you do that on purpose
or on accident?

35:03.469 --> 35:05.504
Don't you lie to me.
On purpose.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.773
My brain told my feet
to stop, and they did.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.810
My brain's never been smarter
than my feet before.
I'm proud of you, Randy.

Now if we can just get you
to stop walkin' around
with your brother's shirt...

I was havin' success too,

although I knew every deal
I made was another favor I owed.

to get everyone out of this

Anyway, I'm gonna need
some brushes to clean off...

35:53.285 --> 35:55.321

when we dig for archaeology.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.523

favor I asked meant another

So far we've
already collected

you have maggots.

Pretty soon,
we had everything we needed.

36:33.459 --> 36:37.629
For his archaeology badge,
we stumbled on the spot where,
in the old days,

36:37.663 --> 36:40.799
the guards played a game
they called Kick the Prisoner
in the Face.

36:40.832 --> 36:44.670
Save the molars.
We could use them to make dice.

For his natural science badge,

36:49.675 --> 36:51.877
we collected lice,
hookworms and maggots.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.979
All we needed now
were some roaches.

Okay. Lights on.

I thought would be the hardest

happen to be a scoutmaster?

And just like that,
Glen got his last two badges...

and was finally awarded
his honor sash.

And when the parole board
heard what a change
he'd made in himself,

they finally gave him
his parole.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.703
And Glen was happy to be out.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.872
But, while people were
no longer afraid of him,

37:53.905 --> 37:55.874
they still judged him
by the way he looked.

in the Scout uniform.

to his old stealin' ways.

the way other people saw him

gettin' him out of here.
