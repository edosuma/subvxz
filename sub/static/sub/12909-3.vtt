Stefan.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.170
Rash.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.500
Henry!

00:38.340 --> 00:39.530
This is Mark Henson...

00:39.580 --> 00:42.010
Laura Jones... and this is Steve Mullen.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.370
All three have been killed
in the last four weeks.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.970
You used the three of them in some
sort of medical experiment in India.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.610
That's what connects them.

00:49.660 --> 00:53.410
Lipocite has now become UK Remicon's
most successful product ever.

00:53.460 --> 00:56.250
I went there as David Leese.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.090
They knew I was coming.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.450
They were expecting me.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.210
So, this is the smoking gun.

01:01.260 --> 01:04.330
This is what links David
Leese to UK Remicon.

01:04.379 --> 01:08.290
UK Remicon's our number one
competitor in the European market.

01:08.340 --> 01:10.250
If they were to be put out of the way,

01:10.300 --> 01:12.810
that could be very advantageous to us.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.330
Coleman!

01:14.380 --> 01:16.580
I have another assignment.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.490
Police! Henry, stop!

01:28.540 --> 01:29.740
Stop!

01:32.220 --> 01:34.130
What the hell are you doing?!

01:34.180 --> 01:37.050
What are you doing?! Get out
the way, he's my suspect!

01:37.100 --> 01:38.970
Get out of MY way!

01:44.740 --> 01:46.540
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

01:52.140 --> 01:54.170
Don't hurt me. Please, just don't hurt me.

01:54.220 --> 01:56.250
- It's OK.
- No-one's going to hurt you, Henry.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.570
All right?

01:57.620 --> 01:59.860
You just... stay there.

02:03.140 --> 02:04.810
What are you doing here?

02:04.860 --> 02:06.370
I came looking for him.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.810
Why?

02:07.860 --> 02:09.930
I can't tell you that.

02:09.979 --> 02:12.010
Yes, you can.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.970
It's about money. It's about fraud.

02:15.020 --> 02:16.570
It's my job. OK?

02:16.620 --> 02:17.690
What's happening?

02:17.740 --> 02:19.930
We'll be with you in a minute.

02:19.980 --> 02:22.570
- You can't talk to him.
- Why not? - Because I'm about to arrest him.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.290
Look, my boss is here, all right?

02:24.340 --> 02:25.690
He can't see you.

02:25.740 --> 02:28.250
I'm taking him in, and we
can sort this out tomorrow.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.530
I'll meet you.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.050
But I was the one who caught him.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.530
Well, that's not true!

02:32.580 --> 02:33.770
We both caught him.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.130
I was the one who saw him!

02:35.180 --> 02:36.290
That's not relevant.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.740
What are you doing in my life?

02:42.860 --> 02:44.970
I don't wanna drown no more

02:45.020 --> 02:47.130
I'm sick of the same old people

02:47.180 --> 02:50.010
The kind that'll sell your soul

02:50.060 --> 02:51.490
Trade it for a shining stone

02:51.540 --> 02:53.730
Ain't nothing in this life for free

02:53.780 --> 02:56.330
Running from the greatest evil

02:56.380 --> 02:58.770
It finally dawned on me

02:58.820 --> 03:00.810
A man's gotta fight temptation

03:00.860 --> 03:05.410
Keep the wolves from the door

03:05.460 --> 03:09.370
I hear them scratching
like I don't know better

03:09.420 --> 03:13.970
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?

03:14.020 --> 03:21.180
It won't be long before I
cave in and open up the door.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.170
Why are you interested in Henry Williams?

03:34.220 --> 03:35.450
I told you...

03:35.500 --> 03:36.970
I can't talk about my work.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.090
Oh, that's ridiculous.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.490
Look, you were at that hotel
because of a man called David Leese.

03:41.540 --> 03:44.820
Can't you see that we're both
investigating the same thing?

03:54.380 --> 03:56.050
How can you eat all that?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.570
- What?
- That crap.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.290
It's breakfast!

04:02.180 --> 04:03.250
Fine.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.730
I'll tell you what I know if
you tell me what you know.

04:05.780 --> 04:06.920
OK.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.170
You go first.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.730
No. I invited you here.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.320
And I paid!

04:13.500 --> 04:15.570
If you tell my bosses...

04:15.620 --> 04:18.089
I told you anything, I'll get killed.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.339
Same.

04:20.420 --> 04:23.860
All right, but this is just between you and me. All right?
- Right.

04:25.060 --> 04:29.970
The SFO are investigating a
company called UK Remicon.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.010
It's huge. It makes
pharmaceutical products.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.210
And?

04:34.260 --> 04:36.210
Well, it's bribing doctors and pharmacists

04:36.260 --> 04:37.890
to promote their products.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.930
Selling to the NHS at
over-inflated prices.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.810
One of those doctors is David Leese,

04:41.860 --> 04:45.360
and David Leese is somehow
linked to Henry Williams.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.610
Now it's your turn.

04:49.820 --> 04:51.490
Henry is, er...

04:51.540 --> 04:55.010
He's connected to the
murder of three people.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.970
Two teachers and a guy that
worked at a gardening centre.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.490
They all took part in some
sort of experiment. In India.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.570
Was that for a company called Greenfern?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.570
- Yes!
- Well, do you know what drug?

05:04.620 --> 05:05.890
Er, an antidepressant.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.330
Name? - We don't know. - David
Leese was CEO of Greenfern!

05:08.380 --> 05:10.770
I know... and Greenfern paid
everyone who took part...

05:10.820 --> 05:12.370
- £600.
- Yes!

05:12.420 --> 05:15.520
Your sister, Leila. Does
she have a boyfriend?

05:16.340 --> 05:20.020
That's... not a question. That's
got nothing to do with this.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.890
Sorry.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.100
Don't even go there!

05:27.380 --> 05:28.580
OK...

05:34.260 --> 05:36.460
What about Henry Williams?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.040
He's our number one suspect.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.850
He was there when one of the
teachers fell to their death.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.370
I actually saw him at the station.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.730
Do you know he was being
paid £20,000 a year?

05:47.780 --> 05:48.850
No, but that makes sense.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.970
He was definitely getting
money from somewhere.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.560
- Who was paying it?
- Greenfern.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.450
Why did you go to the station, Henry?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.900
I didn't.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.640
We have you on CCTV. Why were you there?

06:13.340 --> 06:14.930
I went to meet someone.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.980
Laura Jones.

06:18.580 --> 06:19.720
No.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.420
Then who?

06:24.500 --> 06:25.900
Caroline.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.410
Who's Caroline?

06:31.980 --> 06:33.810
Who is she?

06:33.860 --> 06:35.490
She's my friend.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.210
The one you talk to on the computer?

06:41.180 --> 06:43.920
We've looked at your computer, Henry.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.250
You were using an encrypted
communication platform.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.530
But we couldn't find an
account at the other end,

06:55.580 --> 06:57.810
which means either they deleted it,

06:57.860 --> 07:00.800
or they didn't exist in the first place.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.130
I think Caroline's a
figment of your imagination.

07:05.180 --> 07:07.210
She's real.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.250
So, you met her at the station?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.740
Well...

07:14.500 --> 07:18.610
She said she was going
to come, but she didn't.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.290
No, Henry. Why don't you admit it?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.680
You went there to meet Laura.

07:24.580 --> 07:27.210
Henry didn't used to be like this.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.940
He was a sweet little
boy. He did well at school.

07:32.700 --> 07:38.570
Then his father walked out, and
it all started to go wrong.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.130
I couldn't control him.

07:40.180 --> 07:43.290
He fell in with the wrong crowd
... drugs, drinking all the time.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.490
I just watched him. There
was nothing I could do.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.740
So what happened in India?

07:48.580 --> 07:50.650
There was some sort of test.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.700
I never wanted him to go to
India. I knew it was a bad idea!

07:55.460 --> 07:57.330
So, what happened?

07:57.900 --> 08:01.260
I don't know very much about
it... only what Henry told me.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.330
There was a... There was a hospital.

08:06.740 --> 08:08.250
That's where they all met.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.530
Most of us won't even get the real stuff.

08:11.580 --> 08:13.370
They just give you an injection,

08:13.420 --> 08:16.160
then you lie down for a few of hours.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.490
It was something to do with depression.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.890
It was meant to make
them all feel cheerful.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.650
Are you saying that this drug, this...

08:23.700 --> 08:26.090
whatever they injected
into him... made him ill?

08:26.140 --> 08:28.890
He was already ill! He was an addict!

08:28.940 --> 08:30.940
But it made him worse.

08:33.659 --> 08:34.970
Put it down!

08:35.020 --> 08:36.730
Greenfern looked after him.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.380
That was the name of the company...

08:39.580 --> 08:41.850
.. but they didn't allow him
to leave India for a while,

08:41.900 --> 08:44.290
and when he did come home he
couldn't look after himself.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.530
He moved back in to live with me.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.610
You've tried to look after him.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.650
I HAVE looked after him!

08:50.700 --> 08:54.420
Whatever you think, whatever
you're saying, you're wrong.

08:55.860 --> 08:59.140
You went and found them
one by one, didn't you?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.610
You pushed Mark Henson off a roof...

09:04.460 --> 09:06.650
.. Laura Jones down the escalators...

09:06.700 --> 09:07.900
No.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.060
You ran over Steve Mullen in your car.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.970
- No.
- Yes, Henry.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.130
Why?

09:17.180 --> 09:20.290
Was it something they did in India?
Is that why you wanted to kill them?

09:20.340 --> 09:23.900
I didn't! You... You, er...

09:26.980 --> 09:28.610
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...

09:28.660 --> 09:31.850
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...

09:31.900 --> 09:33.490
I didn't...

09:33.540 --> 09:34.890
I didn't, I didn't...

09:34.940 --> 09:36.770
- I didn't, I didn't...
- Don't worry.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.690
Don't worry, Henry.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.120
You're going to be all right.

09:45.940 --> 09:48.170
'It's not going to be all
right for Henry, is it?'

09:48.220 --> 09:50.530
Henry is going to jail.
Or maybe to Broadmoor.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.530
And what exactly do you
think you were doing,

09:52.580 --> 09:54.010
putting your hand on him?!

09:54.060 --> 09:56.090
Don't you know anything
about physical contact

09:56.140 --> 09:57.490
during an interrogation?

09:57.540 --> 09:59.850
He had his brief in there!

09:59.900 --> 10:01.810
He could do you for assault!

10:01.860 --> 10:03.200
Wanker.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.650
UK Remicon had a subsidiary
in India called Greenfern,

10:06.700 --> 10:08.930
and Greenfern was run by David Leese?

10:08.980 --> 10:11.330
Yes.
- It's the link we've been looking for.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.210
It connects him 100% with UK Remicon.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.450
- And what does Greenfern do?
- It was a clinic

10:15.500 --> 10:18.370
primarily involved in developing
and testing of new drugs.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.450
And one of the volunteers, Henry Williams,

10:20.500 --> 10:23.490
has just been arrested by the
police following how many murders?

10:23.540 --> 10:24.970
- Three.
- Three!

10:25.020 --> 10:27.410
Henry is still being paid by Greenfern.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.530
They don't want anyone
to know what happened.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.920
All right. Let's stop there.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.930
We cannot move forward with this case

10:36.980 --> 10:39.010
while it's a subject of
a police investigation.

10:39.060 --> 10:41.490
- But we've put in months of work.
- I know, and if you recall,

10:41.540 --> 10:43.890
I had my doubts about pursuing
Leese in the first place...

10:43.940 --> 10:46.610
now we're involved in murder
investigation, for God's sake!

10:46.660 --> 10:49.770
But Leese can still get us into UK Remicon.
- No, Stefan.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.930
Right now you can't go
anywhere near David Leese.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.530
It is a police matter.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.120
You're off the case. Both of you!

11:01.700 --> 11:02.930
'William Ashton,

11:02.980 --> 11:05.730
'chairman of pharmaceutical
giant UK Remicon,

11:05.780 --> 11:07.930
'was today forced to issue a statement

11:07.980 --> 11:11.290
'following the police arrest
of 30-year-old Henry Williams

11:11.340 --> 11:12.970
'on suspicion of murder.'

11:13.020 --> 11:16.850
'Henry Williams volunteered for
one of the test programmes.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.090
'Unfortunately he was
a habitual drug user.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.050
'He'd lied on his application form.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.930
'Due to a combination of different
elements in his blood stream,

11:25.980 --> 11:30.290
'he did suffer some sort of episode.'

11:30.340 --> 11:32.690
'What was the drug being tested?'

11:32.740 --> 11:35.810
'It was called Stenokoritin.
It's an antidepressant.

11:35.860 --> 11:38.050
'For reasons unconnected with the test,

11:38.100 --> 11:40.410
'it never went into commercial production.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.530
'Thank you very much.
That's all I have time for.'

11:42.580 --> 11:46.050
'Police have yet to comment on
the triple murder investigation,

11:46.100 --> 11:48.530
'but with shares in UK Remicon falling,

11:48.580 --> 11:52.620
'CEO William Ashton will need to
move quickly to reassure investors.'

12:02.380 --> 12:04.740
Ah, Bruce, come in.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.980
- You wanted to see me.
- That's right.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.480
I was concerned about you, Bruce.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.970
Is everything all right?

12:22.020 --> 12:24.010
Yes, it is. Why wouldn't it be?

12:24.060 --> 12:25.850
You tell me.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.290
Well, sir, if I can be honest with you...

12:29.340 --> 12:30.530
Please.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.650
This business with Henry Williams...

12:32.700 --> 12:34.490
I think that I'm being
drawn into something

12:34.540 --> 12:35.610
that's way above my head,

12:35.660 --> 12:38.600
and I'm not sure I want to be part of it.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.810
Well, I'd say it's a
little late for that now.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.090
You started this...

12:44.140 --> 12:47.490
You came to us... and we
have shown our gratitude.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.610
Three people are dead!

12:49.660 --> 12:52.610
They were killed by Henry.

12:52.660 --> 12:54.530
You know, it's a...

12:54.580 --> 12:58.050
sad story, but he's the
victim in all this.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.770
UK Remicon screwed with his head,
and now they're paying the price.

13:01.820 --> 13:05.330
You saw what happened in India.
You saw it with your own eyes.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.520
That was just the start.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.050
Why would he go after the other
volunteers? That makes no sense.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.930
Well, he's a very disturbed young man.

13:12.980 --> 13:16.380
I don't think sense has got
anything to do with it.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.980
You know, you're lucky
he didn't come after you.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.850
'He didn't do it.'

13:26.900 --> 13:28.930
Henry Williams is confused, all right?

13:28.980 --> 13:32.250
He's not well... but I don't think
he's got it in him to kill anyone.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.810
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.210
Obviously I don't know that yet!

13:36.260 --> 13:38.290
I thought you said you
had a load of evidence.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.210
Well, all the evidence points to Henry Williams.
- Tell me.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.970
OK.

13:43.020 --> 13:46.020
There was a roll of
adhesive tape in his room.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.530
Well, well, well.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.370
It matches the tape
that we found on the roof

13:50.420 --> 13:53.370
that was used when Mark Henson was killed.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.890
That's not conclusive.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.690
No... but that's not all.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.130
We've got fibres from his clothes

13:58.180 --> 13:59.810
that place him at both crime scenes...

13:59.860 --> 14:01.970
Mark Henson AND Laura Jones.

14:02.020 --> 14:05.210
And we found strands of Laura's
hair on one of his jackets.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.450
There was also bloodstains
on his mother's car.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.440
AB... the same blood type as Steve Mullen.

14:11.980 --> 14:14.450
And we know he drove up the M1
to Luton the day Mullen died.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.010
- Is that where he lived?
- Yeah.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.370
It might have been
someone else in the car.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.610
I wish it was.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.770
We got a facial image
from one of the cameras.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.610
And he used his phone
less than a mile away

14:23.660 --> 14:26.260
from the place where Mullen worked.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.170
Anything else?

14:36.220 --> 14:37.570
I already told you.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.690
I saw him at the station
when Laura was killed.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.690
- He was definitely there.
- So he did it.

14:41.740 --> 14:42.890
What?

14:42.940 --> 14:45.370
- Well, it's obvious.
- I just said he didn't do it, what...?

14:45.420 --> 14:46.850
But you just proved that he did.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.250
How much evidence do you need?

14:48.300 --> 14:50.050
The evidence could have been planted.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.450
Who by? What planet are you on?!

14:51.500 --> 14:53.250
The same planet that spiked your drink

14:53.300 --> 14:54.930
and almost has you under a truck.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.650
This is big...

14:57.420 --> 15:00.690
.. and I'm going to prove it...
even if I have to do it on my own.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.370
Go on, then, convince me.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.530
OK.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.290
First of all, someone turned off
the cameras at the tube station

15:07.340 --> 15:09.450
at the exact same time
Laura Jones was killed.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.860
There were two women
there. Contract workers.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.450
Who were they? What were they doing?

15:16.500 --> 15:18.490
And then there's the
question of Henry Williams

15:18.540 --> 15:19.810
and the money he was being paid.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.460
How does he afford all this stuff?

15:24.060 --> 15:26.330
He's getting paid 20 grand a year.

15:26.380 --> 15:27.530
Yeah, but why?

15:27.580 --> 15:29.450
I mean, why are Greenfern
still paying him?

15:29.500 --> 15:32.250
Look, this has got something to
do with what happened in India.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.050
All the people that took part in
that experiment are being killed,

15:35.100 --> 15:36.530
and Henry's getting the blame.

15:36.580 --> 15:37.930
Is that what your bosses think?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.170
No, of course not. They
won't listen to me.

15:40.220 --> 15:41.290
How about you?

15:41.340 --> 15:43.610
- I'm off the case.
- Why?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.050
We can't investigate David Leese

15:45.100 --> 15:47.290
while you're investigating Henry Williams.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.010
So what are you doing?

15:49.060 --> 15:51.130
I'm not doing anything.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.730
- Bruce Lockwood.
- Who's he?

15:55.780 --> 15:58.850
He was the one who led
us to Henry Williams.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.770
He was in India. We should talk to him.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.080
You and me?

16:06.860 --> 16:08.260
Why not?

16:08.980 --> 16:11.250
Just take it seriously, OK?

16:35.980 --> 16:37.370
So where did you get this van?

16:37.420 --> 16:39.170
From a guy I live with.

16:39.220 --> 16:41.010
He's a builder.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.400
Yeah, I'd never have guessed.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.650
- What are you doing?
- I need coffee.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.170
Are you mad? We're an hour late!

16:57.220 --> 16:58.730
What? I can't drive without coffee.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.490
Wait!

17:01.940 --> 17:04.410
We should have taken the train.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.810
Bruce Lockwoood was in India...

17:10.859 --> 17:13.890
and what's interesting is, he also
works for a pharmaceutical company.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.130
Ruhn Laboratories.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.290
- They're bastards.
- What, you know them?

17:17.339 --> 17:19.609
Yeah, I've read about them.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.410
And?

17:22.460 --> 17:24.930
They're an American
pharmaceutical company,

17:24.980 --> 17:26.980
and they're bastards.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.210
'Can't this thing go any faster?'

17:34.260 --> 17:36.330
I'm touching the floor.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.170
I'm THROUGH the floor.

17:39.220 --> 17:42.220
- This is rubbish.
- Can you just relax, OK?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.460
It will get us there.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.900
Bruce...

17:52.820 --> 17:54.610
I'm afraid we're going to be late.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.260
Something's come up with the case.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.480
'A couple of hours?'

18:03.020 --> 18:05.380
You are so annoying.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.660
Idiot.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.650
OK, that's better.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.130
Let's go.

18:19.180 --> 18:22.180
Hurry up, we haven't got all day!

18:37.220 --> 18:40.050
Alison, do you know where Stefan is?

18:40.100 --> 18:42.210
Er, he didn't come in today.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.860
He said he was going to Bristol with a friend.
- OK.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.810
So, tell me,

18:49.860 --> 18:52.800
why are we interested in Bruce Lockwood?

18:53.780 --> 18:55.530
Look...

18:55.580 --> 18:58.050
Why was he at Laura Jones's funeral?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.170
He hasn't seen her in,
what, like, six years?

19:00.220 --> 19:02.130
And suddenly he turns up.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.490
HE'S the one that led
us to Henry Williams.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.730
I don't know, but it almost feels...

19:06.780 --> 19:08.320
Deliberate.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.780
Exactly.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.340
Thank you for looking in, William.

19:39.060 --> 19:41.400
I saw you on the television.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.770
Yes. Not my natural habitat.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.220
Mm.

19:48.180 --> 19:51.170
Did you know about Greenfern?

19:51.220 --> 19:52.810
Is that why you asked me here?

19:52.860 --> 19:54.330
I just wondered.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.610
I only came to UK Remicon
two years ago, Peter.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.450
Greenfern had already been wound down.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.970
What exactly happened in India?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.570
I'm making it my business to find out.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.050
You may be running out of time.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.730
We're under attack. You
do know that, don't you?

20:07.780 --> 20:09.530
This has all been orchestrated.

20:09.580 --> 20:10.730
Who would do that?

20:10.780 --> 20:14.210
Anyone with an interest in a
billion pounds' worth of business.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.330
Ruhn Laboratories?

20:16.380 --> 20:18.970
I wouldn't put it past them.
When it comes to business,

20:19.020 --> 20:21.770
the Americans lead the
world in ruthlessness.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.570
Have you heard anything more from the SFO?

20:24.620 --> 20:26.890
They seem to be retreating.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.610
They've pulled out one of their teams.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.730
Well, that's something.

20:30.780 --> 20:34.580
If they went public right
now, it could be the end of us.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.900
We wouldn't want that.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.250
Precisely.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.610
How are we going to do this?

20:41.660 --> 20:43.460
What do you mean?

20:45.300 --> 20:47.840
I've never done an interrogation.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.140
Um...

20:53.300 --> 20:56.900
It's easy. All right? We'll
just do good cop, bad cop.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.130
But...

20:59.180 --> 21:00.850
I'm not a cop.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.290
Yeah, but he...

21:04.900 --> 21:07.240
He doesn't need to know that.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.290
Yeah.

21:10.340 --> 21:11.500
OK.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.050
I will be bad cop.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.330
No! I'm the bad cop.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.480
Why?
- Because I've done lots of interviews.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.650
And it was my idea.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.540
Come on, Rash, this is going to be fun.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.040
He's just through there.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.570
- Do you remember me?
- Of course.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.490
But I don't understand
why you've come back.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.250
I'll tell you why, Bruce.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.930
Because you've been telling
us a pack of lies. That's why.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.370
I'm sorry. Who's he?

21:59.420 --> 22:02.160
He's an investigator working with me.

22:02.860 --> 22:05.450
- I didn't lie to you.
- You went to Laura's funeral,

22:05.500 --> 22:08.330
even though you haven't
seen her in six years.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.530
Why'd you do that?

22:09.580 --> 22:11.490
Could you just, um...

22:11.540 --> 22:13.410
just wait a minute?

22:17.180 --> 22:18.610
What do you think you're doing?

22:18.660 --> 22:20.370
What?

22:20.420 --> 22:22.760
I was going to ask him that.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.360
Go on, then.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.170
Why did you go?

22:30.620 --> 22:32.330
I don't know. It was an impulse.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.050
- That's another lie!
- You knew Laura for one week.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.410
You don't see her in six years

22:36.460 --> 22:38.290
and now, suddenly, you're at her funeral.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.890
That... doesn't make any sense.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.340
Unless you had another agenda.

22:42.860 --> 22:45.490
And then there was Henry Williams.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.610
When did you see him?

22:46.660 --> 22:48.050
I haven't seen him.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.460
Really?

22:50.540 --> 22:53.330
The sixth was a man called Henry Williams.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.050
He's living in London.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.850
Then how did you know
he was living in London?

22:57.900 --> 22:59.530
I-I don't know. Someone told me.

22:59.580 --> 23:00.690
Who?

23:00.740 --> 23:02.930
Well, I don't remember. One of the others.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.490
He's lying.

23:04.540 --> 23:07.410
You told us because you wanted us to know.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.890
It was the same with David Leese.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.970
It was run by a guy called David Leese.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.020
He works for the NHS.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.250
Have you met him?

23:16.300 --> 23:18.650
- No.
- Do you know what he looks like?

23:18.700 --> 23:19.970
No!

23:20.020 --> 23:21.570
Then why'd you tell us his name?

23:21.620 --> 23:23.770
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about...

23:23.820 --> 23:26.820
you asked me questions,
I gave you answers.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.530
He did that VERY well, didn't he?

23:28.580 --> 23:30.090
I thought so.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.050
Look, I don't have to tell you anything.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.970
This has got nothing to do with me.

23:34.020 --> 23:37.170
- And now he's getting nervous.
- Look, Bruce...

23:37.220 --> 23:40.810
You, Mark Henson, Laura Jones,
Steve Mullen and Henry Williams

23:40.860 --> 23:43.690
all took part in a drugs test
and something went wrong.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.570
Now three of those people are dead.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.960
What do you think about that?

23:48.460 --> 23:51.010
- You could be next.
- It's got nothing to do with me.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.730
It's got everything to do with you.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.570
You know the truth.

23:54.620 --> 23:57.090
And, whoever you're protecting,
they know that too.

23:57.140 --> 23:59.490
I wouldn't go near any tube stations.

23:59.540 --> 24:00.850
That's ridiculous.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.300
I bet they already know
you've talked to us today.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.730
And the question is, are
they going to trust you?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.320
I wouldn't.

24:10.060 --> 24:12.810
Well, um...

24:12.860 --> 24:15.600
here's my number if you want to talk.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.370
Oh, but I'll give you some advice...

24:18.420 --> 24:20.560
Don't leave it too late.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.180
Heh.

24:47.180 --> 24:48.850
That went well!

24:50.420 --> 24:53.410
I thought I was supposed to be bad cop.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.380
What? You were.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.130
I thought you were good.

24:58.180 --> 25:00.370
Yes. But I was supposed to be bad.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.210
You were bad!

25:02.260 --> 25:04.170
But you were bad cop too!

25:04.220 --> 25:05.530
It doesn't matter.

25:05.580 --> 25:07.920
Yeah, we got what we wanted!

25:10.460 --> 25:13.060
He's scared. He'll come back to us.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.570
Now...

25:20.620 --> 25:23.170
I want you to do the same
thing to David Leese.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.420
Why?

25:25.660 --> 25:28.500
I helped you, you help me.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.450
You were here before.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.410
Yes, sir.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.800
Where's your senior officer?

25:45.020 --> 25:46.560
He sent me.

25:47.820 --> 25:49.010
Why?

25:49.060 --> 25:52.060
Further information has
come to light, sir.

25:53.020 --> 25:56.450
You told us that you'd never
heard of Henry Williams,

25:56.500 --> 25:59.850
who's now the chief suspect
in a murder enquiry.

25:59.900 --> 26:04.210
Yet it turns out a company,
Greenfern Consultancy Services,

26:04.260 --> 26:07.170
has been paying him nearly £2,000 a month.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.560
You are the chief executive.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.380
Who told you that?

26:15.740 --> 26:19.370
It's possible he's being paid.
But what I told you was true...

26:19.420 --> 26:21.160
I never met him.

26:22.220 --> 26:24.770
Can you tell me why he's being paid?

26:24.820 --> 26:26.820
It wasn't my decision.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.770
I imagine someone decided that
we owed him a duty of care.

26:31.820 --> 26:32.890
As a matter of fact,

26:32.940 --> 26:35.890
I'm quite surprised he was
given anything at all...

26:35.940 --> 26:38.140
considering what happened.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.930
And what did happen exactly?

26:42.980 --> 26:44.610
He was part of a medical trial.

26:44.660 --> 26:47.530
I told you the last time you were here.

26:48.380 --> 26:50.570
But he lied on his application.

26:50.620 --> 26:53.330
There was a whole cocktail
of drugs in his blood.

26:53.380 --> 26:55.890
As a result, he had a minor episode.

26:55.940 --> 26:59.290
We cared for him, sent him
home as soon as he was ready.

26:59.340 --> 27:02.330
What was the name of
the drug being tested?

27:02.380 --> 27:05.250
Stenokoritin. It was an antidepressant.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.970
OK, well, er, if you have
any further thoughts,

27:13.020 --> 27:15.900
- you know how to reach me.
- Of course.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.580
There is one other thing.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.330
We've had a complaint from
a secretarial assistant

27:30.380 --> 27:32.290
working in this building.

27:32.340 --> 27:34.570
What sort of complaint?

27:34.620 --> 27:37.330
I'm afraid to say, it's
not very pleasant, sir.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.520
It's of a sexual nature.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.180
Who?

27:43.380 --> 27:45.660
His name's Stefan Kowolski.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.730
The complaint's against you.

27:51.780 --> 27:55.530
What? That's... that's
outrageous. That's ridiculous.

27:55.580 --> 27:59.330
You deny that you touched him in
an inappropriate way in this office?

27:59.380 --> 28:01.920
Of course I deny it, I'm married!

28:02.980 --> 28:05.450
And it's his word against mine.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.580
Yes, sir.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.730
But he may not be the only one.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.490
He says that there are other employees

28:13.540 --> 28:16.480
who are also willing to make statements.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.060
Who?

28:22.980 --> 28:24.490
Well, we don't know yet.

28:24.540 --> 28:27.460
But, um... we'll let you know.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.600
Thank you for your time.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.090
Did he buy it?

28:49.100 --> 28:51.500
He almost had a heart attack.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.610
That's great!

28:54.660 --> 28:57.410
Yeah, if we scare him enough, he'll talk.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.580
Yeah.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.240
But who to?

29:13.780 --> 29:15.980
This is your place, right?

29:17.100 --> 29:18.340
Yeah.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.650
Don't you like living here?

29:21.700 --> 29:24.490
I do.

29:24.540 --> 29:27.280
You don't sound too happy to be back.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.490
You know what it's like,
living with two women.

29:30.540 --> 29:33.010
There are no women where I live.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.930
I wish there were.

29:37.660 --> 29:40.260
- We could swap.
- No, we couldn't.

29:41.020 --> 29:42.690
Just a thought.

29:49.940 --> 29:52.530
Sometimes I think it's time to move on.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.660
If I could afford to move
out, I'd go tomorrow.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.330
OK, well, see ya.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.810
You'll hear from Bruce... he's worried.

30:03.860 --> 30:05.860
I'll call if he does.

30:12.580 --> 30:13.850
Rash?

30:13.900 --> 30:15.410
We make a good team.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.400
Missing you already!

30:58.020 --> 30:59.810
It's Coleman.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.860
We may have a problem.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.650
Could you tell me who
gave you the authority

31:31.700 --> 31:34.700
to go back and interview David Leese?

31:36.380 --> 31:38.250
I didn't think I needed authority.

31:38.300 --> 31:42.410
David Leese is the chief pharmacist
of the London Health Trust

31:42.460 --> 31:44.130
and YOU are a TDC.

31:44.180 --> 31:46.520
You need authority to sneeze!

31:47.980 --> 31:49.730
What was the point, anyway?

31:49.780 --> 31:51.530
We've already made an arrest.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.730
Leese is not a suspect
in this investigation.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.250
A company he once ran has
been paying Henry Williams

31:57.300 --> 31:59.810
nearly £2,000 a month!

31:59.860 --> 32:01.730
Who told you that?

32:04.180 --> 32:05.330
Remind me, Marcus.

32:05.380 --> 32:07.810
Didn't I ask you to close
down this operation?

32:07.860 --> 32:09.490
He took a day off.

32:09.540 --> 32:11.210
I didn't know what he was doing.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.450
He's your responsibility.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.490
Strolling around Ruhn Laboratories,

32:15.540 --> 32:17.890
pretending to be a police
officer, for God's sake!

32:17.940 --> 32:20.290
He didn't say he was a police officer,

32:20.340 --> 32:22.090
he said he was an investigator.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.140
He's not even that.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.970
Who's that from?

32:28.020 --> 32:30.210
Their legal department, who do you think?

32:30.260 --> 32:32.450
Threatening us with all
sorts of unpleasantness.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.850
I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not good enough, actually. It really isn't.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.610
We're up against corporations
50 times bigger than us.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.330
More resources, more money, more time.

32:40.380 --> 32:43.170
And then when we make mistakes, we
have the press, the politicians,

32:43.220 --> 32:44.890
the AGO breathing down our backs.

32:44.940 --> 32:47.410
And... we get sued.

32:47.460 --> 32:50.810
Somebody has got to
answer for this, Marcus.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.890
David Leese has made a formal complaint.

32:52.940 --> 32:54.610
So, as far as I'm concerned, that's it.

32:54.660 --> 32:58.050
I've got enough on my plate without
having to answer for you. You're out!

32:58.100 --> 33:01.490
If I'm pissing people off, maybe
it's because they're covering it up.

33:01.540 --> 33:02.890
Covering up what?

33:02.940 --> 33:05.940
I don't think Henry
Williams killed anyone.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.220
Tell him.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.420
Henry Williams has confessed.

33:17.340 --> 33:18.530
When?

33:18.580 --> 33:20.690
What does it matter?
We've got it all on tape.

33:20.740 --> 33:21.890
Case closed.

33:21.940 --> 33:25.130
You're not stupid but you've
overreached yourself. So, get out.

33:25.180 --> 33:27.450
Go on, clear your desk. Go.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.900
I've spoken to Sergeant
Short, he's expecting you.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.450
Thank you for the opportunity.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.800
You brought this on yourself.

33:54.540 --> 33:56.010
Are you sure about this, guv?

33:56.060 --> 33:57.260
What?

33:58.220 --> 33:59.570
He had his uses.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.930
Yeah.

34:00.980 --> 34:03.520
But he blew it, Derek. That's it.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.370
'He's got to go.'

34:05.420 --> 34:06.570
Stefan?

34:06.620 --> 34:08.889
I'm sorry, I know you like
him, but that's how it is.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.650
But this proves he's getting somewhere.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.100
Lose him.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.130
Stefan?

34:25.179 --> 34:27.250
I'm sorry, I need to have a word.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.040
Yeah, of course.

34:47.020 --> 34:49.360
Well, that didn't last long.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.650
Sarge... It's not what it looks like.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.210
It doesn't look very good,
if you want the honest truth.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.960
I stumbled onto something.
All right, it just happened.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.210
You know, the chances of you
getting another TDC posting

35:04.260 --> 35:06.530
after this are pretty slim.

35:08.380 --> 35:09.580
Yeah.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.490
All right.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.780
I'm sorry, Sayyad.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.250
Better get to work.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.090
You're not going to get
me into trouble, are you?

35:31.140 --> 35:33.140
Only be a few minutes.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.010
Mrs Williams.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.600
I wonder if we could have a word?

35:47.140 --> 35:48.740
How is Henry?

35:49.620 --> 35:52.920
They wouldn't let me see
him today, I don't know.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.850
They told me he confessed.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.440
Yes, he did.

35:59.940 --> 36:00.970
I don't understand,

36:01.020 --> 36:04.490
the last time you came here
you weren't dressed like that.

36:04.540 --> 36:05.810
He's...

36:05.860 --> 36:07.530
been promoted.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.370
They asked him all these questions.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.850
Half the time he doesn't
know what's going on.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.000
He just... told them
what they wanted to hear.

36:19.180 --> 36:20.650
I'm sorry.

36:21.820 --> 36:23.610
It's her fault,

36:23.660 --> 36:25.130
that girl he's been seeing.

36:25.180 --> 36:27.740
- Who's that?
- On the computer.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.980
She's my friend. She's real!

36:34.220 --> 36:36.490
They're always talking to
each other... day and night.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.410
The middle of the night, sometimes.
- What?

36:38.460 --> 36:40.130
You heard her?

36:40.980 --> 36:43.090
- So, she was real?
- Course she was real!

36:43.140 --> 36:45.610
She was the one leading him on!

36:48.740 --> 36:51.280
I went to meet someone. Caroline.

36:54.220 --> 36:57.020
But they won't listen to me, your lot.

36:57.660 --> 37:01.300
They're just picking on
Henry because of how he is.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.930
I feel sorry for her.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.330
And I think she was telling the truth.

37:11.380 --> 37:12.730
Maybe that's it.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.130
The girl on the computer.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.770
What about her?

37:15.820 --> 37:17.450
Maybe Henry was being used.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.840
Who by?

37:19.740 --> 37:21.490
They want us to know about India.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.210
They want us to know what happened.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.620
Yes?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.570
This is Bruce Lockwood.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.260
Er, yes?

37:36.500 --> 37:39.050
I'd like to see you again. I'm
coming down to London tonight.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.170
OK.

37:40.220 --> 37:43.050
I'm staying at the Lambton
Hotel. Do you know where that is?

37:43.100 --> 37:44.810
I'll find it.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.600
- Eight o'clock.
- I'll see you there.

38:16.820 --> 38:18.490
How are things?

38:20.500 --> 38:22.090
Er...

38:22.140 --> 38:23.880
I've been fired.

38:24.860 --> 38:26.330
So have I.

38:28.900 --> 38:32.090
I have to say, it's been a
real experience meeting you.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.730
Oh, yeah.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.180
The same.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.120
Look, I'm...

38:40.780 --> 38:42.690
I'm glad you came, OK?

38:42.740 --> 38:44.170
Maybe you're right.

38:44.220 --> 38:46.160
Maybe we are a team.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.650
Yeah.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.840
I had nothing else to do.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.540
Come on.

38:58.060 --> 39:00.770
Mr Lockwood's expecting you, gentlemen.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.220
Room 927.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.930
Thank you.

39:12.540 --> 39:14.090
Did they really fire you?

39:14.140 --> 39:16.330
Yeah. It was David Leese.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.250
- He called my boss.
- I said he'd talk.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.450
Oh, it was a great idea, yeah.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.490
I mean, he talked...

39:23.540 --> 39:24.970
to someone who took away my job.

39:25.020 --> 39:28.860
I talked to you, and the
same thing happened to me.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.250
So, what will you do?

39:33.300 --> 39:35.650
I don't know.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.370
How about you?

39:38.820 --> 39:40.580
Get the truth.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.180
And get our jobs back.

39:55.540 --> 39:57.210
Come on, Rash.

40:12.220 --> 40:14.090
Thanks for coming.

40:18.940 --> 40:20.650
This is a nice place.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.810
All right for some.

40:22.860 --> 40:25.220
Erm... What do you want?

40:26.420 --> 40:28.610
I... I want to tell the truth.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.770
Look, I never meant for
any of this to happen.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.370
I was just trying to...

40:33.420 --> 40:34.570
I was thinking of my career.

40:34.620 --> 40:37.450
But they've manipulated me and I don't know what...
- Does your, er,

40:37.500 --> 40:40.040
company pay for the, er, minibar?

40:40.700 --> 40:42.100
Go ahead.

40:44.260 --> 40:47.450
Look, I went to Laura's
funeral because I was told to.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.610
They said the police would be there
and I was told to approach them.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.600
Yeah, told... who by?

40:55.100 --> 40:56.770
Coleman Blake.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.930
He's the UK vice president
for Ruhn Laboratories.

40:58.980 --> 41:01.130
He's the one behind all of this.

41:01.180 --> 41:03.810
Ruhn Laboratories want us to
know what happened in India.

41:03.860 --> 41:04.970
Yeah.

41:05.020 --> 41:09.050
Why?
- Because they're using it to bring down the competition.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.170
UK Remicon.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.810
That's what this is all about!

41:12.860 --> 41:15.450
What was the drug you tested in Mumbai?

41:15.500 --> 41:17.890
You said it was an anti-depressant.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.690
David Leese said it was
something called Stenokoritin.

41:20.740 --> 41:21.970
That's what UK Remicon said.

41:22.020 --> 41:25.020
But they were crazy about security,
it was just another smokescreen.

41:33.140 --> 41:36.410
It was actually an anti-obesity drug.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.650
It suppresses hunger
by acting on the brain.

41:38.700 --> 41:39.850
Lipocite!

41:39.900 --> 41:41.850
It's one of the biggest
sellers for UK Remicon.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.840
It's worth millions.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.290
So, what happened in India?

41:46.340 --> 41:48.340
How did you find out?

41:49.860 --> 41:51.210
There were six of us.

41:51.260 --> 41:52.890
We were all given injections.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.090
They said it would make us drowsy.

41:55.140 --> 41:58.300
But I woke up just in time to see
one of the volunteers leaving.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.170
I don't know why, but it seemed to
me that he was behaving strangely,

42:04.220 --> 42:06.490
so I decided to follow him.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.690
Put it down!

42:13.740 --> 42:15.810
There was mayhem after that.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.900
I headed back to the ward,
but on the way, I had an idea.

42:27.460 --> 42:30.010
I wanted to know what it was
that they'd injected into us.

42:30.060 --> 42:32.970
So... I stole that.

42:33.020 --> 42:35.010
I hung on to it and then, of course,

42:35.060 --> 42:37.600
I got a job at Ruhn Laboratories.

42:38.380 --> 42:41.050
And, later on, you told your bosses.

42:42.780 --> 42:44.090
And they've been using Henry.

42:44.140 --> 42:46.210
They've been deliberately
screwing with his mind

42:46.260 --> 42:47.810
and he gets the blame for the murders.

42:47.860 --> 42:50.450
Lipocite gets withdrawn and
they corner the market.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.770
They'd kill three
innocent people for that?

42:52.820 --> 42:56.930
The NHS spends £1 billion a
year on anti-obesity drugs.

42:56.980 --> 42:59.380
Three people dead is...

43:01.740 --> 43:04.540
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

43:11.900 --> 43:14.330
Turn-down service.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.170
Beds and towels?

43:16.220 --> 43:18.490
Actually, this isn't a
good moment, do you mind?

43:18.540 --> 43:20.450
Not at all. We will come back.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.500
Sorry to disturb you.

43:24.820 --> 43:26.570
Like I was saying,

43:26.620 --> 43:29.970
how many people would you kill
for a billion pounds a year?

43:30.020 --> 43:32.090
Three people dead is nothing.

43:32.140 --> 43:35.650
You're right. Ruhn has got a
product similar to Lipocite.

43:35.700 --> 43:39.600
It's cheaper and we've been
trying to sell it to the NHS...

43:40.620 --> 43:42.960
We've got to get out of here.

43:44.140 --> 43:45.540
What?

43:46.620 --> 43:48.360
Those two women.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.460
They were downstairs.

43:53.020 --> 43:54.570
And they were in the train station.

43:54.620 --> 43:55.850
Go!

43:55.900 --> 43:57.500
Go. Go, go...

43:58.340 --> 43:59.940
GO!

45:13.060 --> 45:15.770
Up or down? Up or down?

45:15.820 --> 45:17.020
Down!

45:22.180 --> 45:23.810
Up!

45:23.860 --> 45:25.130
Right.

45:49.540 --> 45:50.770
OK...

45:50.820 --> 45:52.100
We...

45:56.220 --> 45:57.420
Or...

45:59.820 --> 46:02.170
No, no, no. No.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.170
We don't need to do this.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.810
No? If they come through that door?

46:05.860 --> 46:08.290
- They won't.
- We've got nowhere to hide!

46:08.340 --> 46:11.250
They killed Bruce. That's what
they wanted. They don't need us.

46:11.300 --> 46:12.410
The bomb was for all of us.

46:12.460 --> 46:14.210
We've got no choice, we have to jump.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.730
- They won't come!
- They might!

46:18.860 --> 46:20.210
Oh... OK...

46:20.260 --> 46:21.780
OK?

46:22.940 --> 46:24.500
OK!

46:25.820 --> 46:27.140
OK.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.410
On three.

46:30.460 --> 46:32.490
One...

46:32.540 --> 46:33.810
Two...

46:34.620 --> 46:36.420
Three!

47:37.340 --> 47:41.380
OK... We... Did we really just do that?

47:42.620 --> 47:44.490
Let's do it again!

47:46.140 --> 47:48.010
You're not serious?

47:48.740 --> 47:50.680
No. I'm not serious.

47:52.860 --> 47:57.260
No, never again. None of this.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.050
That's it.

48:07.220 --> 48:09.820
- Do you want chocolate?
- Ohhh...

48:20.620 --> 48:23.290
'In a statement that shocked
the pharmaceutical industry,'

48:23.340 --> 48:26.570
the US Justice Department today
announced that they have frozen

48:26.620 --> 48:29.010
the assets of major
corporation, Ruhn Laboratories,

48:29.060 --> 48:30.650
pending a joint investigation

48:30.700 --> 48:33.130
with the British Police.

48:33.180 --> 48:34.850
It was a frame-up.

48:34.900 --> 48:37.650
They knew Henry was ill and
they were manipulating him

48:37.700 --> 48:39.930
through his computer and mobile phone.

48:39.980 --> 48:44.330
The woman he knew as Caroline
got him to come to the station.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.720
Because it's romantic, Henry.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.650
Come down the escalator and
meet me on the platform.

48:50.700 --> 48:54.330
She also persuaded him to drive
to Luton and stole the car

48:54.380 --> 48:57.880
while he was there and used
it to kill Steve Mullen.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.170
They planted the tape in his
room and all the other evidence.

49:01.220 --> 49:02.850
Well, well, well.

49:02.900 --> 49:06.380
- They wanted us to arrest him.
- All right. All right. I get it.

49:07.860 --> 49:10.050
I've never come across anything like it,

49:10.100 --> 49:13.260
but it seems you were right, Sayyad.

49:14.260 --> 49:17.130
What about the American, Coleman Blake?

49:19.380 --> 49:22.330
Bruce Lockwood implicated
him before he died.

49:22.380 --> 49:24.890
Yeah, well, we can't arrest him. Not yet.

49:24.940 --> 49:27.130
But we're still gathering evidence on him

49:27.180 --> 49:29.330
and there's nowhere he can go.

49:29.380 --> 49:31.850
We want him, the Americans want him.

49:31.900 --> 49:35.900
He knows who was giving the orders
for all this and he will talk.

49:44.740 --> 49:47.980
William Ashton has resigned
as CEO of UK Remicon.

49:53.300 --> 49:56.250
And Lipocite has been
withdrawn from the market.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.370
What about David Leese?

49:58.700 --> 50:02.060
He's been arrested for his
part in the Greenfern cover-up.

50:08.140 --> 50:11.220
'For concealing the results
of the medical tests.'

50:18.500 --> 50:20.290
'What about taking bribes?'

50:20.340 --> 50:25.050
Leese was getting his commission
from Greenfern Consultancy Services.

50:25.100 --> 50:26.930
We've managed to track down payments.

50:26.980 --> 50:29.530
We know we've got him
squirming on the hook.

50:29.580 --> 50:31.650
He's telling us everything
we want to know.

50:31.700 --> 50:33.970
Everything about UK
Remicon's business practices.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.330
Which is what we wanted
in the first place.

50:36.380 --> 50:37.860
Right.

50:40.940 --> 50:43.890
I suppose you expect me
to give you your job back?

50:43.940 --> 50:45.930
Um...

50:45.980 --> 50:49.740
Yeah. And I want a pay rise.

50:51.100 --> 50:52.410
Don't push your luck.

50:52.460 --> 50:55.490
You can have your job...
same pay, same conditions...

50:55.540 --> 50:58.210
but may I remind you, this
is a serious organisation,

50:58.260 --> 51:00.730
this is not The Man From UNCLE.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.330
And... what about the two women?

51:04.380 --> 51:07.890
Oh, the mysterious
Caroline and her friend.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.080
Well, we may never know.

51:10.820 --> 51:14.380
I've spoken to Special Branch,
Counterterrorism, Interpol.

51:17.620 --> 51:19.730
The best guess is they've almost certainly

51:19.780 --> 51:21.920
already left the country.

51:26.340 --> 51:27.940
Do you mind?!

52:10.540 --> 52:11.810
Henry!

52:14.940 --> 52:16.850
It's all over now.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.440
I'll look after you. Don't worry.

52:21.340 --> 52:23.810
It's all going to be all right.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.580
Here you are.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.180
So, how are you?

52:48.820 --> 52:50.220
I'm good.

52:51.260 --> 52:53.130
I got my job back.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.740
Me too.

53:02.460 --> 53:05.000
So why did you want to meet here?

53:06.540 --> 53:08.930
Well, I just thought
you might be interested.

53:08.980 --> 53:10.260
What?

53:11.420 --> 53:13.210
I'm looking at a flat.

53:13.260 --> 53:15.460
- What, to rent?
- To buy.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.100
Why would I be interested in that?

53:22.020 --> 53:24.650
I can only afford half the mortgage.

53:24.700 --> 53:28.740
It's been on the market a while.
They've dropped the price.

53:33.020 --> 53:34.330
It looks all right.

53:34.380 --> 53:35.570
Yeah.

53:35.620 --> 53:37.220
Two bedrooms.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.500
Yeah.

53:44.620 --> 53:47.210
All right, I'll take a look.

53:47.260 --> 53:48.780
Why not?

53:58.540 --> 54:01.130
Oi, your face jumping off
the building. Scared!

54:01.180 --> 54:03.090
What're you talking
about? I wasn't scared.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.690
I'd do it again right now.

54:04.740 --> 54:07.730
Your face!

54:07.780 --> 54:10.780
Whether I'm going or whether I'm staying

54:12.060 --> 54:15.700
I see a mountain at my gates

54:16.780 --> 54:21.210
I see it more and more each day

54:21.260 --> 54:24.420
I see a fire out by the lake

54:25.860 --> 54:30.090
I'll drive my car without the brakes

54:30.140 --> 54:32.970
Oh, gimme some time

54:33.020 --> 54:39.330
Show me the foothold
from which I can climb...

54:39.380 --> 54:40.970
You know...

54:41.020 --> 54:42.610
Ever since I met you...

54:42.660 --> 54:46.970
My life has taken a serious... turn...

54:47.020 --> 54:48.890
downhill!

54:48.940 --> 54:51.730
Oh, when I come to climb

54:51.780 --> 54:57.210
Show me the mountain so far behind

54:57.260 --> 55:00.330
Yeah, it's further away

55:00.380 --> 55:07.340
Its shadow gets smaller
day after day...
