WEBVTT

03:20.793 --> 03:22.729
Hey.

03:22.762 --> 03:24.162
Thanks.

03:24.196 --> 03:26.164
Yeah.

03:26.198 --> 03:29.401
I can't keep working half-shifts
like this, Shelly.

03:29.435 --> 03:31.938
You need to help me jump
my car again.

03:31.971 --> 03:33.940
I gotta start working
more hours.

03:33.973 --> 03:34.941
Tomorrow.

03:34.974 --> 03:37.309
Then I'm gonna need
the car again tonight.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.945
I picked up a shift from Tommy.

03:38.978 --> 03:40.345
Okay.

03:40.379 --> 03:41.714
What time?

03:41.748 --> 03:43.916
11:30.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.351
Fine.

03:46.385 --> 03:49.455
Do you have this month's rent?

04:37.537 --> 04:39.237
Hey, Shell.

04:39.271 --> 04:40.740
Hey, what's up?

04:40.773 --> 04:43.241
What's up? What's going on?

04:43.275 --> 04:44.677
You know...

04:45.845 --> 04:48.614
Yeah, I know what you mean.

04:48.648 --> 04:50.415
Super lame over here too.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.518
Do you think you could take
those books back

04:52.552 --> 04:53.418
to the uni for me?

04:53.453 --> 04:55.387
They've been really riding
my ass.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.524
Yeah, I mean...

04:58.558 --> 04:59.826
I could, or...

04:59.859 --> 05:02.294
we could go together.

05:02.327 --> 05:03.796
Uh...

05:03.830 --> 05:05.598
I don't... I don't think so.

05:05.631 --> 05:07.667
Yeah, why don't we go together?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.669
I'll help you register.

05:10.837 --> 05:12.705
You know you can
still come back.

05:12.739 --> 05:15.373
I just...

05:15.407 --> 05:16.909
No, I...

05:16.943 --> 05:18.444
It'd be weird, I just...

05:19.746 --> 05:21.514
It's not, though.

05:21.547 --> 05:23.549
It's really not.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.951
It'll be fine.

05:24.984 --> 05:27.987
Look, are you... are you
gonna do it for me or not?

05:29.989 --> 05:32.959
Yeah, whatever.

05:32.992 --> 05:36.596
Hey, um, is Thomas around?

05:36.629 --> 05:39.499
No, he's at the store.

05:39.532 --> 05:42.502
He's on this really annoying
homemade-everything kick.

05:42.535 --> 05:43.503
I don't know.

05:45.337 --> 05:46.572
Oh, he just got in.

05:46.606 --> 05:48.841
A little help would be great.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.045
- What?
- It's Shelly.

05:53.079 --> 05:55.948
All right, I got some more down
in the car, will you go grab it?

05:55.982 --> 05:58.451
Clean your fucking nose off.

05:58.484 --> 05:59.852
Shelly, hey, how's it goin'?

05:59.886 --> 06:01.754
Oh...

06:01.788 --> 06:03.556
You know, it's tough.

06:03.589 --> 06:06.659
Yeah?
Real dog-eat-dog out there.

06:06.692 --> 06:08.326
What can I do for you?

06:08.360 --> 06:11.396
You think... just maybe, um...

06:11.430 --> 06:14.467
I've just...
I got expenses everywhere,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.068
I've got no fucking cash.

06:16.102 --> 06:17.737
- Shelly.
- Rebecca's hounding me...

06:17.770 --> 06:20.072
Shelly, Shelly, Shelly,
I got you, I got you.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.674
Great.

06:21.707 --> 06:24.811
Oh my God, Thomas, thank you.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.814
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries,
that's fine, it's just, uh,

06:27.847 --> 06:29.882
you know, remember our deal,
all right?

06:29.916 --> 06:33.619
Could you maybe come by my work
late today?

06:33.653 --> 06:34.954
I'll find some time,
I'll come through

06:34.987 --> 06:36.489
and I'll give you a bag,
all right,

06:36.522 --> 06:37.790
to tide you over till later.

06:37.824 --> 06:39.125
Thanks, thanks again, Thomas.

06:39.158 --> 06:42.662
All right, yup,
see ya when I see ya.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.997
Jesus Christ,
do you think you got enough?

06:45.031 --> 06:46.999
Stockin' up, baby.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.569
I see that.

06:51.904 --> 06:54.040
Wait, did you hang up?

06:54.073 --> 06:56.843
- Yeah.
- I wasn't done talking to her.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.911
She was done talking to you.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.148
Wow, Thomas,
you just really don't care

07:02.181 --> 07:03.616
about anybody, do you?

07:04.951 --> 07:06.886
Rebecca...
all right, you know what,

07:06.919 --> 07:08.420
you wanna know
what I'm doing here?

07:08.454 --> 07:09.589
- Huh?
- Yeah, I do.

07:09.622 --> 07:11.791
I'm trying to go to her house
so I can speak to her

07:11.824 --> 07:13.793
about this whole,
you know, college thing,

07:13.826 --> 07:15.127
speak her language,

07:15.161 --> 07:17.897
see if I can get a fire
under her belly, you know?

07:17.930 --> 07:19.498
Look...

07:19.532 --> 07:22.435
I get it, all right,
she's depressed and lonely,

07:22.468 --> 07:23.636
and she's your friend,

07:23.669 --> 07:25.938
and if you want me to play
the supportive boyfriend role,

07:25.972 --> 07:28.441
then that's what I'm gonna do
for you.

07:28.474 --> 07:29.976
It's not just that.

07:30.009 --> 07:31.544
- There's...
- What is it?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.913
I don't know,
there's more to it!

07:33.946 --> 07:35.815
You can't just push Shelly.

07:35.848 --> 07:37.516
She's... she's fragile.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.886
She's not just depressed
or whatever.

07:39.919 --> 07:42.188
And I was already talking
to her about it...

07:42.221 --> 07:44.657
Rebecca, Rebecca,
it was her idea!

07:44.690 --> 07:45.825
All right?

07:45.858 --> 07:47.927
What do you want me
to do about it, huh?

07:47.960 --> 07:50.062
Really, what do you
want me to do?

07:50.096 --> 07:51.964
I don't know!

07:51.998 --> 07:53.833
Look...

07:53.866 --> 07:56.469
I think Shelly is frustrated

07:56.502 --> 07:59.038
with the way that you nag her
about this shit all the time.

07:59.071 --> 08:01.974
I mean, think about it,
Jesus Christ, I would be.

08:02.008 --> 08:05.111
All you do is you make her
feel guilty about this shit,

08:05.144 --> 08:08.080
and I know that you know
you're doing that, so...

08:08.114 --> 08:11.717
you know, if someone's being
selfish here, it's you.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.556
- Fuck you, Thomas.
- Yeah, all right,

08:17.590 --> 08:19.091
let's react about it.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.860
Let's react about it.

08:20.893 --> 08:23.095
Chop up some lines,
let's do coke all day.

08:23.129 --> 08:24.864
That sounds tight.

08:53.159 --> 08:54.527
Car trouble?

08:56.162 --> 08:57.997
Yeah.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.799
I can maybe give you a jump.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.200
You try that yet?

09:02.234 --> 09:05.104
I, uh...

09:05.137 --> 09:06.739
I don't know.

09:06.772 --> 09:08.841
Well, why don't we give it
a shot?

09:13.713 --> 09:15.881
- What's up, Shelly?
- Thomas!

09:15.915 --> 09:17.516
How we doin'?

09:17.550 --> 09:19.218
Hate my life, wanna die.

09:19.251 --> 09:23.189
- So you still need help.
- Yeah.

09:25.057 --> 09:27.693
You see that?

09:27.727 --> 09:29.695
I don't give a fuck,
I'm not the boss.

09:29.729 --> 09:31.130
All right,
so we can do it right here?

09:31.163 --> 09:32.298
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:32.331 --> 09:33.299
Till next time.

09:33.332 --> 09:34.834
- Thanks, Thomas.
- Yup.

09:38.070 --> 09:40.006
Thanks, Grover, I... don't know

09:40.039 --> 09:42.174
how I let it sit here
for so long.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.609
That's all right.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.144
But, uh,

09:45.177 --> 09:47.680
I'm gonna need that rent,
Francis.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.583
Come on, man, I thought
we were having a moment here.

09:50.616 --> 09:53.185
Rules are rules, man.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.721
Look, I... I've got your money.

09:55.755 --> 09:59.625
I... I just need to take care
of a couple things first.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.193
Shelly...

10:01.227 --> 10:03.062
Shelly hasn't been
a lot of help.

10:04.163 --> 10:06.665
No shit!

10:06.699 --> 10:09.668
Never got why you live
with a queer.

10:09.702 --> 10:11.570
All right, Grover, thanks.

10:11.604 --> 10:13.105
Sure, Francis.

10:13.139 --> 10:16.108
I'll be seein' you
about that rent, man.

10:20.079 --> 10:22.615
Greedy motherfucker.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.290
Hey, Sam.

10:31.323 --> 10:33.559
Yeah, no, I'm coming.

10:43.903 --> 10:45.738
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:45.771 --> 10:47.339
Wanna go to the bar later?

10:47.373 --> 10:49.375
- Definitely!
- Cool.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.656
Hey, Shelly, um...
I just want to let you know

11:03.689 --> 11:05.658
that I got my car
back up and running,

11:05.691 --> 11:08.327
so I'm not gonna need
the truck later.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.229
Are you okay?

11:10.262 --> 11:11.997
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm fine.

11:12.031 --> 11:13.732
I'm just outta the house.

11:13.766 --> 11:16.902
Okay, so,
you don't need the truck?

11:16.936 --> 11:18.237
No, it's fine.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.073
You sure you're all right?

11:26.278 --> 11:27.813
Look, Shelly, I gotta go.

13:50.856 --> 13:53.125
- Fucking bitch.
- No, no, no.

13:53.158 --> 13:55.495
Would you shut the fuck up
for one second?

13:55.528 --> 13:57.430
- You are so self-righteous.
- ...yapping at me

13:57.464 --> 14:00.232
since you got here,
shut the fuck up for a second.

14:00.266 --> 14:02.535
No, I know what your
fucking president thinks of me

14:02.569 --> 14:04.903
- and women and Black people.
- You fucking snowflake.

14:06.238 --> 14:09.808
You are so self-righteous!

14:09.842 --> 14:12.445
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking bitch.

14:12.479 --> 14:15.080
You've been fucking going at me
since you got me.

14:15.114 --> 14:17.116
Shut the fuck up, you fucking...

14:17.149 --> 14:18.150
Bye, Hillary.

14:18.183 --> 14:20.352
Oh, now you're just gonna
fucking run away?

14:20.386 --> 14:22.855
Fucking Nazi scum.

14:22.888 --> 14:25.525
Urge to smack you upside
your fucking head.

14:27.359 --> 14:28.461
Jerk.

14:28.495 --> 14:29.496
Oh, hey.

14:29.529 --> 14:31.964
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.132
Fuck off!

14:34.300 --> 14:36.101
Hi, Shell.

14:36.135 --> 14:38.037
Glad you finally showed up.

14:39.104 --> 14:41.206
See that asshole I scared off?

14:42.374 --> 14:44.910
Hey, let me get you something.

14:44.943 --> 14:46.546
Could I have
another gin and tonic

14:46.579 --> 14:48.847
and something
for my friend here?

14:48.881 --> 14:50.517
- Tequila?
- Oh, fuck that!

14:50.550 --> 14:52.084
You think I'm made of money?

14:52.117 --> 14:53.520
Get her a rail vodka.

14:53.553 --> 14:55.921
- That okay?
- Double.

14:59.091 --> 15:01.327
He was such a jerk.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.530
Well, what do you know
about that guy?

15:03.563 --> 15:04.531
The fucking hat!

15:04.564 --> 15:07.966
Jeez, I thought you'd give
more of a shit.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.968
Why were you talking to him?

15:10.002 --> 15:11.870
Oh my God, I just...

15:14.973 --> 15:16.509
What's going on?

15:20.480 --> 15:22.381
You don't look well.

15:22.414 --> 15:25.117
I have a lot of my own shit
right now, okay?

15:25.150 --> 15:27.052
Go easier on yourself.

15:31.423 --> 15:32.559
You working tonight?

15:34.259 --> 15:35.894
Yeah.

15:35.928 --> 15:37.930
Not until later.

15:40.366 --> 15:42.334
Be safe.

16:04.990 --> 16:06.526
Um...

16:06.559 --> 16:08.060
I'll be right back.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.462
Okay, all right.

16:09.496 --> 16:10.663
I swear.

16:10.697 --> 16:13.198
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, no.

16:13.232 --> 16:16.301
Just chill out,
watch out for that motherfucker,

16:16.335 --> 16:18.003
don't let him come back here.

16:18.036 --> 16:20.573
I'll be right back,
I will be right back.

16:23.075 --> 16:24.943
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

16:26.579 --> 16:28.648
Look, this is how it's gonna go.

16:28.681 --> 16:32.351
We're gonna hook you up,
but this is the last time.

16:34.721 --> 16:36.422
- Okay.
- Okay, Shelly?

16:36.456 --> 16:37.624
Uh, yeah.

16:38.658 --> 16:40.292
I'm serious.

16:42.629 --> 16:44.363
Okay.

17:10.122 --> 17:11.290
Shelly.

17:12.525 --> 17:15.662
Hey, so did you think
about what I asked you?

17:15.694 --> 17:17.362
I'm not fucking going.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.731
- Really?
- Nope.

17:18.765 --> 17:21.266
I ain't leaving
without you this time.

17:22.535 --> 17:24.236
I'm not.

17:24.269 --> 17:26.204
I'm not fucking going!

17:26.238 --> 17:28.207
- I'm never going with you!
- Yeah, really?

17:28.240 --> 17:30.710
- That's unfortunate.
- I'm working.

17:30.743 --> 17:33.746
I'm not going, I'm working.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.616
Well, hey, guess what,
I know you're working,

17:36.649 --> 17:39.318
because I fucking paid for you.

17:41.788 --> 17:43.322
But it's all good.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.023
I paid for you.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.059
- I'm not...
- Listen!

17:47.092 --> 17:49.462
He just wants to see you,
it's not a big deal.

17:49.496 --> 17:50.563
Come on, let's go.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.699
- No!
- Hey, hey!

17:52.732 --> 17:54.434
- No!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:54.467 --> 17:56.068
- No!
- Whoa, whoa!

17:56.101 --> 17:58.203
What the fuck,
you fucking bitch!

17:58.237 --> 17:59.338
Ow!

17:59.371 --> 18:01.206
Jesus fucking Christ!

18:01.240 --> 18:03.610
All you had to fucking do
was come with us!

18:03.643 --> 18:05.678
- Barry!
- Just get the fuck up!

18:05.712 --> 18:07.780
- Fuck you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:07.814 --> 18:08.982
What the fuck is your problem?

18:09.014 --> 18:11.751
What's your fucking problem?
She just fucking cut me.

18:13.786 --> 18:15.087
Oh!

18:15.120 --> 18:16.388
Okay!

18:16.421 --> 18:19.291
Okay, hello, I guess I'll go
fucking bleed somewhere else.

18:19.324 --> 18:20.660
Get the fuck out now!

18:20.693 --> 18:22.361
We ain't done, bitch!

18:22.394 --> 18:23.796
You're out
of your fucking element.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.330
Out!

18:25.364 --> 18:27.232
Oh, thanks for the napkin.

18:27.266 --> 18:28.735
Get up, Shelly.

18:30.803 --> 18:32.438
- Come on.
- Barry...

18:32.472 --> 18:34.339
Get up.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.344
Thank you.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.650
Barry.

18:55.193 --> 18:56.496
Hey.

18:59.532 --> 19:01.534
What can I get you?

19:19.184 --> 19:20.453
Wake up, we gotta go.

19:20.486 --> 19:22.154
It's... we're closed.

19:22.187 --> 19:23.623
It's time.

19:23.656 --> 19:25.692
We're closed?

19:44.611 --> 19:46.846
Slow night?

19:46.879 --> 19:48.347
Yeah.

19:51.651 --> 19:54.119
Think we might have
to let you go.

19:55.622 --> 19:57.457
Might not be the worst thing.

19:57.490 --> 20:00.225
Like, let me go, let me go?

20:00.258 --> 20:01.527
Yeah.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.866
Okay.

20:06.899 --> 20:09.869
It's not like any of us
want to be here anyway.

20:11.571 --> 20:14.540
Yeah.

20:14.574 --> 20:18.243
Look, won't just
spring it on you, you know?

20:18.276 --> 20:20.245
Wanna make sure you land okay.

20:20.278 --> 20:22.682
Wanna let the heat go up.

20:22.715 --> 20:26.753
Like, where's your jacket?
It's fucking freezing out here.

20:26.786 --> 20:29.421
Thanks, Barry.

20:29.455 --> 20:30.490
All right.

20:30.523 --> 20:33.291
Good night, Shelly.

20:33.325 --> 20:35.327
Good night, Barry.

20:55.748 --> 20:57.750
Shelly, you home?

23:51.090 --> 23:52.859
Rebecca?

23:52.892 --> 23:54.527
Francis...

23:55.795 --> 23:58.431
Have you seen Shelly?

24:11.978 --> 24:14.046
I don't know, like,
think about it, like,

24:14.080 --> 24:16.482
crazy cat lady,
man's best friend.

24:16.515 --> 24:19.585
Like, cats are feminine and dogs
are inherently masculine.

24:19.619 --> 24:21.554
That's how society views them.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.922
In theory.

24:22.955 --> 24:26.826
- In theory?
- Yeah, that's like a cartoon...

24:26.859 --> 24:28.628
aspect of it.

24:28.661 --> 24:29.662
No, I mean...

24:29.695 --> 24:31.797
I don't look at cats and go,
"Oh, feminine."

24:31.831 --> 24:35.001
I mean, we even sexualize cats,
like, with Catwoman

24:35.034 --> 24:37.904
and, like, how cats are, like,
slinky and everything,

24:37.937 --> 24:39.171
and a girl can be...

24:39.205 --> 24:40.907
Vagina is called "pussy."

24:40.940 --> 24:42.208
Yes, thank you.

24:42.241 --> 24:44.810
You are actually making
my point for me.

24:44.844 --> 24:46.078
But don't get it twisted,

24:46.112 --> 24:48.781
I'm not agreeing
with this cat theory.

24:48.814 --> 24:51.984
No, I think it's obviously
a sexism issue nowadays,

24:52.018 --> 24:53.653
and women don't get the credit...

24:53.686 --> 24:54.787
That was Shelly's car.

24:56.022 --> 24:57.623
So what?

24:57.657 --> 25:01.027
What do you mean, "so what?"
She's my fucking friend.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.462
What do you want me...
you want me to go back there...

25:03.496 --> 25:04.764
- Yes, I do.
- ...'cause her fucking car

25:04.797 --> 25:06.565
- is parked in a parking lot?
- Yes, I do!

25:06.599 --> 25:08.601
- I'm trying to go home.
- Thomas, turn around.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.468
I'm not turning around...

25:09.502 --> 25:11.871
Turn the fucking car around,
Thomas!

25:11.904 --> 25:15.574
Jesus fucking Christ,
all right, Jesus.

25:22.181 --> 25:24.250
It's been a pretty good week.

25:24.283 --> 25:26.652
Um, I talked to Mom
on the phone,

25:26.686 --> 25:28.988
and she's doing good.

25:29.021 --> 25:31.791
Um, she has a visiting day
coming up,

25:31.824 --> 25:35.227
and I think
I'm gonna go see her.

25:35.261 --> 25:37.830
She would, uh, she would love
if you could come,

25:37.863 --> 25:40.266
but we both know
that you're tired

25:40.299 --> 25:43.169
and... and it's hard for you.

25:43.202 --> 25:45.037
Um...

25:45.071 --> 25:47.840
I'm still working at
the warehouse you set me up at.

25:47.873 --> 25:50.076
Yeah, the... the boss, he's a...

25:50.109 --> 25:52.244
he's a really good guy,
you know.

25:52.278 --> 25:54.547
I'm, uh, thinking
he might see me through,

25:54.580 --> 25:57.783
start, uh, letting me take on
more responsibilities.

25:57.817 --> 26:01.921
Um... I keep the house
nice and clean,

26:01.954 --> 26:05.257
and, um, I've been seeing
a girl.

26:05.291 --> 26:07.994
Yeah, I've been seeing
a new girl.

26:08.027 --> 26:09.729
Her, uh, her name is Casey.

26:09.762 --> 26:12.231
She's, uh, she's really kind.

26:12.264 --> 26:13.933
I think you'll like her.

26:13.966 --> 26:16.102
Uh, she takes care of people
and...

26:27.046 --> 26:29.815
I hate to do this, but, um,

26:29.849 --> 26:32.251
I have to be getting back
to work.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.127
Love you.

26:44.964 --> 26:47.566
How's she doin'?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.201
The usual.

26:49.235 --> 26:52.138
Still not responsive.

26:53.839 --> 26:55.174
Oh.

27:01.814 --> 27:03.315
Here.

27:03.349 --> 27:05.084
Thanks, Casey.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.087
See you next week, Harry.

27:09.288 --> 27:10.623
It's Barry.

27:11.323 --> 27:13.192
Mm-hmm.

27:21.133 --> 27:22.802
You good, Barry?

27:22.835 --> 27:23.636
Yeah.

27:23.669 --> 27:26.072
Just holler
if you need anything.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.951
Come on, Barry,
answer the fucking phone, dude.

27:40.386 --> 27:42.388
Fuck.

27:46.025 --> 27:48.360
Hey, Francis,
did you hear what I said?

27:49.829 --> 27:51.197
Hey, Rebecca!

27:51.230 --> 27:53.132
Her phone's in here.

27:55.301 --> 27:58.237
We found her phone.

27:58.270 --> 28:00.406
Francis?

29:00.799 --> 29:02.701
- Hey, Vic.
- Hey.

29:02.735 --> 29:04.803
- Glass of water.
- Okay.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.111
So...

29:16.815 --> 29:18.150
We'll get to that.

29:55.187 --> 29:56.255
Hey.

29:56.288 --> 29:58.257
Do you know Shelly Baker?

29:59.191 --> 30:01.093
Yeah.

30:01.126 --> 30:04.063
Have you seen her around at all?

30:04.096 --> 30:05.331
Why?

30:06.332 --> 30:07.866
Look, I'm her roommate,

30:07.900 --> 30:10.202
and she didn't come home
last night.

30:10.236 --> 30:12.938
Could she have just hooked up?

30:12.972 --> 30:14.474
Well, then why did we find
her car

30:14.507 --> 30:16.108
abandoned on the side
of the road?

30:17.276 --> 30:19.546
Who's we?

30:19.579 --> 30:21.548
Some people who care
about Shelly.

30:21.581 --> 30:23.349
Have you seen her or not?

30:26.519 --> 30:27.886
Yeah.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.322
Where?

30:34.860 --> 30:37.830
Hey. You didn't happen to see
Shelly Baker here

30:37.863 --> 30:39.231
the other night, did you?

30:39.265 --> 30:40.399
Yeah, yeah.

30:40.433 --> 30:44.303
Um, she forgot her coat
when she left.

31:00.052 --> 31:03.055
- Hey, Thomas?
- Francis, hey.

31:03.088 --> 31:05.190
Okay, have you guys found
anything yet?

31:05.224 --> 31:06.593
No, no.

31:06.626 --> 31:09.828
Okay, so, I just spoke
to one of Shelly's coworkers...

31:09.862 --> 31:10.829
- Francis.
- ..and like,

31:10.863 --> 31:12.998
apparently she's not
technically missing,

31:13.032 --> 31:15.401
- but we found her car, so...
- Francis.

31:15.435 --> 31:18.203
...what technically qualifies
as missing is like...

31:18.237 --> 31:21.173
Francis, shut...
Francis, shut the fuck up, man.

31:21.206 --> 31:23.275
I'm trying to tell you
something, dude.

31:23.309 --> 31:26.879
- What?
- Well...

31:26.912 --> 31:30.517
You know Shelly
was using again, right?

31:35.287 --> 31:37.056
Fuck, really?

31:38.891 --> 31:42.861
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know,
it's... fucked up, dude.

31:42.895 --> 31:45.964
Goddamn it, Thomas.

31:45.998 --> 31:47.366
I know, I know.

31:47.399 --> 31:49.335
Oh, fuck.

31:49.368 --> 31:50.537
You...

31:50.570 --> 31:52.971
- Fuck.
- Look, I know this is fucked up,

31:53.005 --> 31:55.140
and I think I know
what's going on

31:55.174 --> 31:57.009
and I can help you,
but I need to know

31:57.042 --> 31:59.311
you're gonna be fucking cool
about it, all right?

31:59.345 --> 32:04.083
Look, I think there's
someone you should meet.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.295
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:56.328 --> 34:00.700
I'm sorry I wasn't here
yesterday.

34:00.733 --> 34:05.237
But I'm here now, so...

34:05.270 --> 34:07.440
Do you have it?

34:07.474 --> 34:09.641
Yeah, yeah.

34:20.219 --> 34:21.219
Okay.

34:22.554 --> 34:25.123
Hey, Sam, wait.

34:25.157 --> 34:26.458
Can I...

34:29.293 --> 34:31.129
You look like shit.

34:33.733 --> 34:37.168
Everybody slips sometimes, Sam.

34:37.202 --> 34:38.505
I don't.

34:40.172 --> 34:43.141
I got him that fish movie
he wanted.

34:46.646 --> 34:50.248
Anything else?
It's cold.

34:51.283 --> 34:55.020
No, no, I guess not.

34:56.121 --> 34:58.323
Ha... have you...

34:58.357 --> 35:00.627
Have you heard
from your cousin at all lately?

35:00.660 --> 35:03.429
You skip out on her half
of the rent again?

35:03.463 --> 35:04.497
No.

35:05.565 --> 35:07.165
Never mind.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.704
No.

35:13.706 --> 35:16.241
No, I haven't, not in months.

35:18.444 --> 35:20.480
Okay.

35:21.514 --> 35:23.215
How's she been?

35:27.487 --> 35:30.355
I thought
she'd been doing better.

35:31.658 --> 35:33.860
Guess I'm just worried, is all.

35:33.893 --> 35:36.796
She'll make a person do that.

35:36.829 --> 35:38.798
Yeah.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.136
It's cold.

35:44.169 --> 35:45.772
Yeah, no, sorry.

35:47.239 --> 35:49.408
Hey, she'll turn up.

35:49.442 --> 35:51.578
She always does.

35:53.913 --> 35:55.448
Yeah.

36:19.472 --> 36:22.675
Hey, what's up?
We're in the middle of pr...

36:22.709 --> 36:25.878
What? I'm doing what
he asked me to do.

36:27.580 --> 36:31.249
Well, we're still trying
to find her, right?

36:31.283 --> 36:33.151
Okay.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.244
- So, Vic.
- We're done here, Martin.

36:59.277 --> 37:01.246
Well, I hear one of your girls
went missing.

37:01.279 --> 37:02.615
What's your point?

37:02.649 --> 37:05.451
Well, I heard she was
a little different.

37:05.485 --> 37:07.920
- I heard she was slack...
- Go home, Martin.

37:07.954 --> 37:11.658
- Maybe I can find her for you?
- I don't think so.

37:11.691 --> 37:13.693
Well, maybe I already know
where she is.

37:13.726 --> 37:15.962
- Barry!
- Just give me like five grand.

37:15.995 --> 37:18.965
I swear I'll find her for you.

37:18.998 --> 37:20.733
Take a walk.

37:23.770 --> 37:24.871
Fine.

37:30.610 --> 37:32.679
Fuck that frozen cunt.

37:38.985 --> 37:41.654
- Fuck did he want?
- A job.

37:41.688 --> 37:42.855
Tasteless.

37:42.889 --> 37:44.557
They're just hungry.

37:51.464 --> 37:52.932
Hello?

37:54.033 --> 37:56.736
Okay.

37:56.769 --> 37:58.805
Man on his way?

37:58.838 --> 38:00.740
Yeah.

38:02.407 --> 38:05.645
Do you really think this is
the best way to go about things?

38:05.678 --> 38:06.746
Why not?

38:06.779 --> 38:08.681
It's just too messy.

38:09.816 --> 38:11.451
I don't think so.

38:12.350 --> 38:13.519
But why?

38:15.688 --> 38:18.558
Never pay for something
you can get for free, Barry.

38:33.072 --> 38:35.007
Hello?

38:35.041 --> 38:37.944
Barry, what's up?

38:37.977 --> 38:38.978
No, no, no, no.

38:39.011 --> 38:41.279
We're, uh, we're looking
at all the hospitals

38:41.313 --> 38:43.983
like you said,
but nothing's turned up yet.

38:45.685 --> 38:49.354
Yeah, her roommate.

38:49.387 --> 38:51.423
Well, he's a guy.

38:51.457 --> 38:54.660
His name's Francis.

38:54.694 --> 38:57.029
To be honest, no,
I don't get that vibe.

38:57.063 --> 39:01.434
In fact, actually, I think he's
our best bet at finding her.

39:03.069 --> 39:05.004
Can you give me a second?

39:09.374 --> 39:11.077
Barry?

39:11.110 --> 39:12.712
Yeah.

39:12.745 --> 39:15.782
All right, so,
he's kind of an AA nut, right?

39:15.815 --> 39:17.917
Did a little stint in prison
for beating the shit

39:17.950 --> 39:21.020
out of his baby mama's new boo,
but... I don't know,

39:21.053 --> 39:23.990
he's got this white knight thing
going on right now,

39:24.023 --> 39:26.926
and plus, Shelly being
his baby mama's cousin,

39:26.959 --> 39:28.928
I don't know, I think he's
trying to score some points

39:28.961 --> 39:30.863
by helping her stay sober.

39:30.897 --> 39:34.667
Yeah, well,
she has her secrets, obviously.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.770
No, no, no, no, no.

39:37.804 --> 39:39.539
All right.

39:39.572 --> 39:40.773
Bye.

39:54.386 --> 39:55.721
What?

40:12.738 --> 40:14.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, bruh.

40:14.874 --> 40:16.676
I gotta pat you down.

40:20.913 --> 40:22.915
You good. Follow me.

40:30.756 --> 40:32.124
Hey.

40:32.158 --> 40:34.727
Do you know who I am?

40:34.760 --> 40:37.830
I've been out of the game
for a while.

40:37.864 --> 40:39.131
So I've heard.

40:40.166 --> 40:43.002
But do you know who I am?

40:49.475 --> 40:51.444
Give us a second.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.755
It's okay.

41:03.789 --> 41:06.792
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are.

41:06.826 --> 41:10.496
So I don't have to tell you why
me and Shelly are acquainted?

41:10.529 --> 41:12.098
I can guess.

41:12.131 --> 41:14.166
Know what I want you to do?

41:14.200 --> 41:18.104
I'm assuming you have
a list of names, suspects.

41:18.137 --> 41:19.705
There's only two.

41:19.739 --> 41:21.941
Just two?

41:21.974 --> 41:24.677
I'm pretty sure I know
what's going on.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.045
Explain it to me then.

41:28.147 --> 41:30.750
One of them is her brother Saul.

41:30.783 --> 41:32.752
Do you know him?

41:33.953 --> 41:36.022
That doesn't surprise me.

41:36.055 --> 41:39.458
He's kinda reclusive
ever since his conviction.

41:39.492 --> 41:40.893
What'd he do?

41:40.927 --> 41:42.662
Touched a kid.

41:42.695 --> 41:45.064
Jesus.

41:45.097 --> 41:46.866
The only reason I bring him up

41:46.899 --> 41:48.801
is 'cause I've caught him
hanging around here

41:48.834 --> 41:50.202
a couple times.

41:50.236 --> 41:52.972
I thought he might be skeevin'.

41:53.005 --> 41:56.075
I also think he was trying
to get her to quit,

41:56.108 --> 41:59.745
so he might've gotten her
to drop off the radar.

41:59.779 --> 42:00.980
So who's the other guy?

42:02.081 --> 42:04.116
John, goes by King.

42:04.150 --> 42:06.519
King?

42:06.552 --> 42:09.889
King was all about Shelly.

42:09.922 --> 42:12.058
The thing is, though,

42:12.091 --> 42:14.593
she wouldn't let him close.

42:14.627 --> 42:16.696
And...

42:16.729 --> 42:20.967
well, they had an altercation
the other night.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.002
And if I'm being
totally honest,

42:23.035 --> 42:25.504
it had been simmering
for a while.

42:25.538 --> 42:28.007
I didn't handle
the whole thing real well.

42:29.842 --> 42:31.844
It got dealt with,

42:31.877 --> 42:34.914
but not before it got ugly.

42:34.947 --> 42:38.050
You see, Francis,

42:38.084 --> 42:41.187
guys like King
can sometimes get obsessive,

42:41.220 --> 42:43.756
and I'm worried that
he might've gotten her alone,

42:43.789 --> 42:46.792
where we can't protect her.

42:46.826 --> 42:50.696
So you think they either have
Shelly or know where she is?

42:50.730 --> 42:52.264
They might.

42:53.733 --> 42:55.601
What's the catch?

42:58.804 --> 43:01.073
I'm gonna be straight with you.

43:01.107 --> 43:04.643
They owe me
and my affiliates money,

43:04.677 --> 43:06.946
and I need this done.

43:06.979 --> 43:10.583
However,
I also appreciate the fact

43:10.616 --> 43:15.955
that we live in small towns
with a lot of social overlap.

43:15.988 --> 43:18.991
There has been a lot of shit
flying over your head.

43:21.127 --> 43:25.031
I'm giving you an opportunity.

43:25.064 --> 43:28.601
Maybe it's time for you
to stop playing the victim.

43:33.072 --> 43:35.674
I'll send Barry with you.

43:36.742 --> 43:38.110
Barry!

43:44.884 --> 43:46.719
So, will he do it?

43:46.752 --> 43:48.587
He's thinking about it.

43:48.621 --> 43:50.156
No, he's not,
he's just gonna run...

43:50.189 --> 43:52.625
$800.

43:52.658 --> 43:55.194
That's Shelly's half
of the rent.

43:56.328 --> 43:57.963
Okay.

44:02.835 --> 44:04.703
Do we know where they are?

44:04.737 --> 44:06.806
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

44:10.309 --> 44:13.145
Hope you know
what the fuck you're doin'.

44:17.683 --> 44:19.285
Hold up.

44:19.318 --> 44:20.619
Hurry up!

44:20.653 --> 44:22.788
Slow your role, chief.

44:23.823 --> 44:25.391
You got a piece?

44:27.126 --> 44:28.961
A gun.

44:28.994 --> 44:31.797
I gotta go back
to the house to get it.

44:40.239 --> 44:41.707
What the fuck.

44:41.740 --> 44:42.374
No, don't!

45:02.995 --> 45:05.231
Is that it?

45:05.264 --> 45:07.666
Yeah.

45:07.700 --> 45:10.102
What'd they take?

45:10.136 --> 45:13.806
Well, my computer, for one.

45:24.884 --> 45:26.886
Jesus fucking Christ.

45:28.821 --> 45:31.023
This place is fucking trashed.

45:31.056 --> 45:33.058
Yeah.

45:33.092 --> 45:37.930
I can't even tell what they took
other than her computer.

45:37.963 --> 45:39.932
I don't get it.
Do you... do you think

45:39.965 --> 45:42.001
it was one of these guys
Vic was talking about?

45:42.034 --> 45:43.470
- Could be.
- All right,

45:43.503 --> 45:46.805
then let's fucking go.

45:48.340 --> 45:50.809
Jesus, what are you, 100?

45:50.843 --> 45:53.779
Station broadcasts
at a low frequency.

46:00.753 --> 46:02.988
Look, can you fucking not?

46:05.991 --> 46:07.026
All right.

46:12.231 --> 46:13.832
You ready?

46:13.866 --> 46:15.367
For what?

46:15.401 --> 46:17.770
It's just...

46:17.803 --> 46:20.372
things can get intense.

46:20.406 --> 46:22.141
How so?

46:22.174 --> 46:24.376
Well, for starters,

46:24.410 --> 46:26.178
this one time I went
to meet this guy

46:26.212 --> 46:28.280
who accidentally blew
his own face off.

46:28.314 --> 46:31.283
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

46:31.317 --> 46:34.353
Guess he was waiting for me with
a shotgun aimed at the door.

46:34.386 --> 46:37.089
I was running a little late,
and when I walked in,

46:37.122 --> 46:40.059
I guess I scared him, and bam!

46:40.092 --> 46:41.327
Bullshit.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.463
You don't even know
the half of it.

46:43.496 --> 46:47.866
The super-fucked up thing is,
he lived.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.502
Now he's got a new face.

46:51.270 --> 46:53.405
Well, what's it look like?

46:53.440 --> 46:55.274
Ehh...

46:55.307 --> 46:58.445
It's not bad, but...
it could be worse.

47:00.112 --> 47:03.282
Kinda sick, huh?

47:03.315 --> 47:04.817
Lost his sense of smell.

47:07.019 --> 47:09.955
Okay, this is it.
Park over here.

47:16.161 --> 47:17.863
See the house up there,

47:17.896 --> 47:19.198
white sedan pokin' out?

47:19.231 --> 47:20.467
Yeah.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.301
That's it.

47:23.836 --> 47:26.405
You ready?

47:26.439 --> 47:27.940
Yo, you with me?

47:27.973 --> 47:29.408
Yeah, yeah.

48:06.646 --> 48:08.515
Where the fuck is she, Saul?

48:08.548 --> 48:09.549
Fuck, who?

48:09.582 --> 48:11.884
Who? You know who the fuck
I'm talking about.

48:11.917 --> 48:13.419
- Where the fuck is Shelly?
- I don't know!

48:13.453 --> 48:15.254
- Where the fuck is she?
- Don't kill me, please.

48:15.287 --> 48:17.256
I swear to God, I will pull
this goddamn trigger.

48:17.289 --> 48:18.558
- Barry...
- Don't look at him.

48:23.395 --> 48:25.030
Look, just go to class,
all right?

48:25.064 --> 48:27.366
I'll be here in three hours.

48:29.469 --> 48:31.103
Okay.

49:22.154 --> 49:23.288
Grover.

49:25.124 --> 49:26.425
Thomas.

49:26.459 --> 49:28.327
Can I have my code?

49:31.063 --> 49:33.298
This'll put me even,
plus a round?

49:33.332 --> 49:35.934
This will put you even,
plus a round.

49:35.968 --> 49:37.570
Here's your baggie,
as promised.

49:37.604 --> 49:39.706
Get the fuck outta here.

49:39.739 --> 49:41.508
Remember,
you didn't see me.

49:41.541 --> 49:42.975
Right.

52:04.249 --> 52:05.652
Oh!

52:07.687 --> 52:10.422
Shit. Shit!

53:41.581 --> 53:43.549
What?

53:44.784 --> 53:47.920
Um... I'm-I'm-I'm required,

53:47.954 --> 53:51.457
since you're new
in the, uh, neighborhood,

53:51.491 --> 53:55.461
I-I'm required by law
to inform you that...

53:55.495 --> 53:58.397
I'm a convicted sex offender.

54:00.298 --> 54:01.534
I'm not required
to tell you

54:01.567 --> 54:02.468
about the specifics
of my crime,

54:02.502 --> 54:05.505
but i-if you wanna inquire,
you can, uh,

54:05.538 --> 54:08.441
call my caseworker, Debbie.

54:08.474 --> 54:10.710
Which house is yours?

54:15.014 --> 54:18.216
Get the fuck off
my property.

55:28.386 --> 55:29.555
Where the fuck is she, Saul?

55:29.589 --> 55:30.857
Where the fuck is Shelly?

55:30.890 --> 55:32.424
- Who?
- Who?

55:32.458 --> 55:33.459
You know who the fuck
I'm talking about!

55:33.493 --> 55:34.727
Where the fuck is Shelly?

55:34.761 --> 55:36.462
- I don't know!
- Where the fuck is she?

55:36.496 --> 55:37.597
Don't kill me, please.

55:37.630 --> 55:38.498
I swear to God, I will pull
this goddamned trigger.

55:38.531 --> 55:40.332
- Barry, Barry...
- Don't look at him.

55:40.365 --> 55:42.635
I swear to God,
you're talkin' to me.

55:42.668 --> 55:45.538
- Where the fuck is she, Saul?
- I don't know!

55:47.974 --> 55:49.509
Aww, shit!
Go after him!

55:49.542 --> 55:51.409
- Fuck!
- Fuck, man!

56:00.653 --> 56:02.420
Son of a bitch!

56:04.791 --> 56:06.058
Lookie there!

56:07.894 --> 56:09.327
Hey!

56:16.869 --> 56:18.905
Shouldn't have
fucking ran, Saul.

56:23.042 --> 56:25.745
You okay?

56:25.778 --> 56:26.979
Fine.

56:27.013 --> 56:29.347
Fuckin' jomo.

56:29.381 --> 56:30.850
All right,
one more fucking time.

56:30.883 --> 56:31.851
Where is Shelly?

56:31.884 --> 56:32.852
Shelly's missing?

56:32.885 --> 56:34.352
Fuck that!

56:34.386 --> 56:35.988
You ran outta here
like you know something.

56:36.022 --> 56:38.024
You guys scared
the shit outta me!

56:38.057 --> 56:38.958
I mean, you think
that's the first time

56:38.991 --> 56:39.926
someone's kicked in my door?

56:39.959 --> 56:41.527
I'd rather be killed
where I have witnesses.

56:41.561 --> 56:43.563
Yeah. Heard you fucked a kid.

56:44.931 --> 56:46.098
It's not like that.

56:46.132 --> 56:48.901
Then what's it like?

56:48.935 --> 56:50.469
Okay, yeah, yeah,
it's like that.

56:50.503 --> 56:51.637
I oughta blow
your fuckin' brains out

56:51.671 --> 56:52.872
- right...
- Look, look,

56:52.905 --> 56:55.541
I've done ten years,
I'm in therapy, please!

56:55.575 --> 56:56.909
Where's Shelly?

56:58.410 --> 56:59.111
She's not with you, Barry?

56:59.145 --> 57:01.147
Fuck you think, Saul?

57:01.180 --> 57:04.083
Look, yeah, I was trying
to talk to her, but...

57:04.116 --> 57:05.885
Why?

57:07.520 --> 57:09.021
Our dad's lookin' for her.

57:09.055 --> 57:10.790
What?

57:10.823 --> 57:12.758
Dad, our dad is
looking for her.

57:12.792 --> 57:14.060
I fuckin' heard you!

57:14.093 --> 57:15.595
Why is that bad?

57:15.628 --> 57:17.730
Look, he's just
bad news, okay?

57:18.564 --> 57:19.665
Sorry, Saul.

57:19.699 --> 57:21.767
We're gonna need more
if we're gonna let you go.

57:21.801 --> 57:24.136
Look, why do you think
we're so fucked up, huh?

57:24.170 --> 57:25.605
Drugs?

57:25.638 --> 57:27.440
Fuck you. No.

57:38.050 --> 57:39.685
Fuck.

57:45.558 --> 57:47.727
My dad's a cruel man, okay?

57:57.036 --> 57:58.170
Look.

58:01.173 --> 58:02.508
Shelly got the worst of it.

58:09.215 --> 58:11.150
Sometimes, I can still
hear her whimpering.

58:23.062 --> 58:25.831
Look...

58:25.865 --> 58:28.834
eventually,
CPS came and picked us up and

58:28.868 --> 58:30.836
we got bounced around
from house to house.

58:33.739 --> 58:35.141
But it was too late, though.

58:39.612 --> 58:41.147
Francis, you, uh...

58:41.180 --> 58:45.551
you went to high school
with Shelly, right?

58:45.584 --> 58:49.021
Then... then you can attest,
I mean...

58:49.055 --> 58:53.159
She ran away constantly,
and...

58:53.192 --> 58:56.495
even back then,
it was clear.

58:56.529 --> 58:57.730
She'd been hurt.

59:01.067 --> 59:03.769
You'd drink too
is all I'm sayin'.

59:14.547 --> 59:16.682
Look, I...

59:16.716 --> 59:20.619
I know what I did was wrong.

59:20.653 --> 59:24.991
But, fuck, I...

59:25.024 --> 59:26.659
I'm broken too.

59:39.271 --> 59:40.606
Saul.

59:44.143 --> 59:46.178
I believe you.

59:49.648 --> 59:50.850
Look.

59:50.883 --> 59:53.152
Do you really wanna
help Shelly?

59:53.185 --> 59:56.756
Yes... yes,
I'd do anything.

59:56.789 --> 59:58.190
Then come with us.

59:58.224 --> 01:00:00.026
- We've got another lead.
- What?

01:00:00.059 --> 01:00:01.260
No!

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:02.895
Is it King?

01:00:06.232 --> 01:00:07.767
Yeah.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.801
How'd you know?

01:00:10.936 --> 01:00:13.339
Dad has King
looking for her too.

01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:14.707
Wait.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.008
King knows your dad?

01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:17.109
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:17.143 --> 01:00:18.611
King and my dad
go way back.

01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:19.879
He's King's boss.

01:00:19.912 --> 01:00:21.947
Wait... your dad's Fat Dan?

01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:23.682
Fat Dan?

01:00:23.716 --> 01:00:25.918
This white supremacist
asshole from the '90s.

01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:28.254
The gang he ran with
used to run east of 35E.

01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:30.790
Yeah, still do.

01:00:30.823 --> 01:00:36.228
They're still pushing
meth, heroin, kids.

01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:37.997
Didn't Fat Dan go to prison?

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.132
Went to prison,
past tense.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.634
Do you know
where he is now?

01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:43.002
No.

01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:44.336
I been looking for King, though.

01:00:46.005 --> 01:00:48.674
We know where King is.

01:00:48.707 --> 01:00:50.676
Shit, let's go, then.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.344
Excuse me?

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:53.879
Yo, fuck this guy.

01:00:53.913 --> 01:00:55.614
He is not coming with us.

01:00:55.648 --> 01:00:58.884
Why not? Look, he's just
looking for his sister.

01:00:58.918 --> 01:01:00.753
You know we could use
the extra muscle anyway.

01:01:00.786 --> 01:01:02.321
What's the problem?

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:06.692
The problem, Francis,

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:07.760
is that you're forgetting
a key part

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:09.261
of what we're doing here.

01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:15.234
You owe me money, Saul.

01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:19.872
Do you have it?

01:01:19.905 --> 01:01:21.173
No, but...

01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:24.343
Fuck, Saul!

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:26.912
Fuck!

01:01:26.946 --> 01:01:28.380
Look.

01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:31.951
Look, you've roughed me up.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:33.986
If-if-if I help you,
can we...

01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:35.754
can we just call it even?

01:01:35.788 --> 01:01:37.323
No!

01:01:37.356 --> 01:01:38.824
How much does he owe?

01:01:38.858 --> 01:01:39.925
Fuck that.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.394
How much?

01:01:44.196 --> 01:01:45.798
Six.

01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:46.732
Six hundred.

01:01:46.765 --> 01:01:47.700
I've got two, though.

01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:53.105
I'll cover the rest of the four
from mine.

01:01:56.942 --> 01:01:58.410
Fine.

01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:00.012
Fuck it.

01:02:00.045 --> 01:02:01.881
He's all you, though.

01:02:01.914 --> 01:02:05.885
I want it known, I don't like
this pedophile fuck.

01:02:18.498 --> 01:02:21.434
Do not make me regret this.

01:02:54.534 --> 01:02:55.435
Hey!

01:03:00.806 --> 01:03:02.408
Francis!

01:03:02.442 --> 01:03:04.376
Hey, Shelly!

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:05.811
Oh!

01:03:05.844 --> 01:03:07.746
I haven't seen you
in, like, three months!

01:03:14.153 --> 01:03:15.821
Ever since rehab,

01:03:15.854 --> 01:03:21.393
I've just felt
like I'm fucking gutted,

01:03:21.427 --> 01:03:26.466
just, like, ripped apart.

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:32.371
And I've just been
drifting.

01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:35.241
I mean...

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.076
We're still young.

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:38.143
Your twenties are
supposed to be

01:03:38.177 --> 01:03:40.946
kind of a mess.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.015
You're just kind of
out of the curve.

01:03:43.048 --> 01:03:45.384
Yeah.

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:50.322
Things...
things'll get better.

01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:52.858
At... at what age...

01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:54.393
at what age
are things good?

01:03:54.426 --> 01:03:56.795
When do things get better?

01:03:59.932 --> 01:04:01.233
Soon.

01:04:02.968 --> 01:04:06.972
- Soon, I think.
- Yeah. Yeah...

01:04:07.006 --> 01:04:09.308
I love the way
it feels on my feet.

01:04:09.341 --> 01:04:10.543
Never met a bed as comfortable

01:04:10.577 --> 01:04:13.580
as the sand.

01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:21.521
I used to run away here
all the time.

01:04:21.554 --> 01:04:23.922
You ran away?

01:04:23.956 --> 01:04:27.926
All the time!

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.597
When you came
to my house.

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.132
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:38.103
Yeah.

01:04:41.474 --> 01:04:44.577
- You want?
- Uh-uh.

01:04:44.611 --> 01:04:48.013
- Uh-uh.
- Fair enough.

01:04:48.047 --> 01:04:50.082
I'm glad I'm beside you.

01:04:53.653 --> 01:04:57.089
Mm-hm, uh-huh.

01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:04.096
Hey, Shelly?

01:05:04.129 --> 01:05:05.532
Mm?

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:11.103
Okay.

01:06:39.425 --> 01:06:40.527
Oh my God.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.628
Been looking all over for you.

01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:42.695
Shh!

01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:45.665
Been looking all over for you.

01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:47.032
- Hm.
- This place is like

01:06:47.065 --> 01:06:50.202
a fucking maze.

01:06:54.072 --> 01:06:55.742
It's actually
fuckin' beautiful.

01:06:55.775 --> 01:06:59.178
It's boorish,
is what it is.

01:06:59.211 --> 01:07:01.079
Oh.

01:07:01.113 --> 01:07:02.549
Do you have it?

01:07:02.582 --> 01:07:04.416
Yeah.

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.984
So...

01:07:06.018 --> 01:07:10.155
all together, shit came
to about 1500.

01:07:10.189 --> 01:07:14.226
So... we, uh, we good?

01:07:16.629 --> 01:07:20.700
You know, this collection
reminds me of you.

01:07:20.733 --> 01:07:22.334
Yeah?

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.604
Chaotic

01:07:24.637 --> 01:07:28.073
and barely contained.

01:07:28.106 --> 01:07:29.476
Primitive.

01:07:31.711 --> 01:07:35.347
And ugly.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.718
- What the fuck, Vic?
- I'm saying you,

01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:40.720
like these paintings,

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.622
are not to my liking.

01:07:42.655 --> 01:07:44.524
Yeah, I know,
I'm fucking gettin' that,

01:07:44.557 --> 01:07:46.191
Jesus Christ.

01:07:53.065 --> 01:07:54.567
Wait, are you fucking
firing me?

01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:56.235
I'm firing you.

01:07:56.268 --> 01:07:57.537
You can't fucking fire me!

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:59.137
And I thank you
for your service,

01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:00.607
but I also think
we should no longer

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.374
do business with each other.

01:08:02.407 --> 01:08:04.677
- Vic, you can't fuckin'...
- What?

01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:06.446
What, Thomas?

01:08:06.479 --> 01:08:08.347
Did you think
I would let you play bookie?

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.716
No!

01:08:09.749 --> 01:08:11.283
Did you think that I would
let you run a debt train

01:08:11.316 --> 01:08:12.719
on my employees?

01:08:12.752 --> 01:08:13.753
No, I wasn't trying to...
Vic, I was just trying

01:08:13.786 --> 01:08:16.589
- to fucking help you, man!
- No, you weren't.

01:08:18.858 --> 01:08:20.392
You were just
taking advantage.

01:08:20.425 --> 01:08:22.394
Shelly?

01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:25.798
This is the last time
I will let anybody,

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:29.801
especially you,
push anyone over the edge.

01:08:32.471 --> 01:08:33.506
Let me?

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.140
You think you
fucking let me?

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:38.143
I would choose
your next words

01:08:38.176 --> 01:08:40.446
very carefully.

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:06.606
Holy shit, Thomas!

01:09:06.639 --> 01:09:09.107
Thomas, what the fuck?

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.375
What the fuck
is going on?

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:11.678
Shut the fuck up!

01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:13.479
Shut your fucking mouth,
Rebecca!

01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:15.279
For once!

01:09:17.182 --> 01:09:19.216
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:20.520
You've dragged me
all over town

01:09:20.553 --> 01:09:22.421
and we're barely getting
through these fliers,

01:09:22.455 --> 01:09:23.823
- and now you're...
- Fuck the fliers!

01:09:23.856 --> 01:09:25.658
Fuck the fucking fliers,
Rebecca.

01:09:25.692 --> 01:09:26.492
Fuck Shelly,

01:09:26.526 --> 01:09:28.560
fuck this whole
fucking situation.

01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:31.631
I'm done with it,
I'm fucking done!

01:09:31.663 --> 01:09:33.533
- Pull over.
- No. We're going home.

01:09:33.566 --> 01:09:34.466
Let me out.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.401
- We're going fucking home!
- Pull over!

01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:38.604
Pull over, pull over!

01:09:38.638 --> 01:09:39.772
Fuck you.

01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:41.573
Get the fuck
out of the car.

01:09:41.608 --> 01:09:44.276
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Gladly.

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:46.712
- Fuck you, Thomas!
- Fuck you.

01:09:48.848 --> 01:09:50.314
Shut the fucking door!

01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:51.818
You shut the fucking door!

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:53.486
Rebecca!

01:09:53.519 --> 01:09:55.755
Fuck you!

01:09:55.788 --> 01:09:57.189
Goddammit.

01:10:54.914 --> 01:10:56.749
So that's it?

01:10:58.785 --> 01:11:01.319
Yeah.

01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:02.555
Let's go.

01:11:29.015 --> 01:11:30.516
Ring the bell.

01:11:32.919 --> 01:11:34.386
It's all you, man.

01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:38.491
Jesus Christ.

01:11:49.035 --> 01:11:50.302
Saul!

01:11:50.335 --> 01:11:52.370
Motherfuckin' Saul!

01:11:55.942 --> 01:12:01.814
Why, I ain't seen you
since you was.

01:12:01.848 --> 01:12:05.283
What the shit you want?

01:12:05.317 --> 01:12:08.955
Hey-hey King, uh,
have you seen Shelly?

01:12:08.988 --> 01:12:13.693
Oh, your fuckin' dad
sent you, didn't he?

01:12:14.994 --> 01:12:15.962
Oh yeah.

01:12:15.995 --> 01:12:18.396
I saw her.

01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:20.833
I saw her, like,
a couple of days ago,

01:12:20.867 --> 01:12:22.969
and I don't know
why this motherfucker

01:12:23.002 --> 01:12:24.570
didn't tell you
that he saw her,

01:12:24.604 --> 01:12:27.440
because he fuckin' saw her,
and guess what?

01:12:27.473 --> 01:12:28.941
I tried talkin' to her.

01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:31.477
Woo, doggie, lookit!

01:12:31.511 --> 01:12:33.880
That bitch fuckin' cut me.

01:12:35.815 --> 01:12:37.450
And I fuckin' told Dan,

01:12:37.483 --> 01:12:39.886
I am not lookin' to lose
a fuckin' pound of flesh

01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:41.454
over it.

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:43.623
Wait... Dan was looking for her?

01:12:47.794 --> 01:12:50.328
Uh, yeah.

01:12:50.362 --> 01:12:53.365
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:12:53.398 --> 01:12:55.902
And he's looking for
this cocksucker, too.

01:12:57.436 --> 01:13:00.338
- Hey, King!
- What?

01:13:00.372 --> 01:13:02.542
I need you
to go get diapers!

01:13:05.845 --> 01:13:07.113
All right.

01:13:07.146 --> 01:13:10.382
- And be quick about it!
- Yeah! Okay!

01:13:10.415 --> 01:13:13.553
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:13:13.586 --> 01:13:15.655
Oh, man.

01:13:21.393 --> 01:13:23.896
This is where he's at.

01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:26.532
Just take the goddamned
fucking thing.

01:13:26.566 --> 01:13:29.802
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:33.873
Look! Door is locked.

01:13:33.906 --> 01:13:35.708
That's where he's at.

01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:37.543
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:13:37.577 --> 01:13:38.778
That's it?

01:13:38.811 --> 01:13:41.914
Get off my fucking porch.

01:13:41.948 --> 01:13:45.451
You know, my fucking neighbors
are watching.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.659
So, Francis.

01:13:53.693 --> 01:13:55.094
Mm-hm?

01:13:55.127 --> 01:13:57.730
You're good at this,
you know?

01:13:57.763 --> 01:14:03.002
You got the right balance
of anger and patience.

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:05.972
It's good for
this line of work.

01:14:06.005 --> 01:14:08.441
Yeah, I used to do
something similar.

01:14:08.474 --> 01:14:09.976
Where?

01:14:10.009 --> 01:14:11.911
In prison.

01:14:11.944 --> 01:14:14.180
Fell in with a guy
kinda bringing

01:14:14.213 --> 01:14:17.750
his own type of justice
on the cellblock.

01:14:17.783 --> 01:14:20.753
Targeted strikes, theft.

01:14:20.786 --> 01:14:22.889
You name it, I...

01:14:22.922 --> 01:14:25.625
yeah, it was...
it was similar.

01:14:25.658 --> 01:14:27.927
Hm.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.896
Yeah.

01:14:29.929 --> 01:14:33.165
Meet your kids' new dad?

01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:35.134
Yeah.

01:14:35.167 --> 01:14:36.736
Did he...

01:14:36.769 --> 01:14:38.070
No.

01:14:38.104 --> 01:14:41.707
No, um,
I just didn't like him.

01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:43.075
Hm.

01:14:43.109 --> 01:14:46.479
Was drinkin' a lot
back then.

01:14:46.512 --> 01:14:48.648
Fuck you, Derek!

01:14:48.681 --> 01:14:49.982
What?

01:14:50.016 --> 01:14:51.117
That's what I should have said.

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:52.218
"Fuck you, Derek."

01:14:52.251 --> 01:14:53.886
Who?

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.221
King.

01:14:55.254 --> 01:14:58.090
- His name's Derek?
- Yeah, cool name, right?

01:14:58.124 --> 01:14:59.659
Totally.

01:14:59.692 --> 01:15:01.494
You're the one to talk.

01:15:03.596 --> 01:15:05.932
Well, shit, let's not
waste no more time, man.

01:15:05.965 --> 01:15:08.167
Gotta get to Dan's.

01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:12.638
I-I'm hungry.

01:15:27.853 --> 01:15:30.256
Fuck.

01:15:30.289 --> 01:15:33.059
I forgot to collect
King's debt.

01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:38.597
Is there any ketchup?

01:15:48.574 --> 01:15:51.477
Jesus fuck!

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.048
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Tara.

01:15:56.082 --> 01:15:57.516
Hi, Tommy.

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.618
What's up, baby?

01:15:59.652 --> 01:16:01.554
Where's Becca?

01:16:01.587 --> 01:16:02.955
Fuck that bitch.

01:16:02.989 --> 01:16:06.192
- Yeah?
- She's fuckin' nuts.

01:16:06.225 --> 01:16:07.727
Well, shit!

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.962
I mean, if you wanted
a new boo,

01:16:09.996 --> 01:16:11.897
you could just, you know,

01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:14.734
I'm just right here
and everything, and I'm...

01:16:14.767 --> 01:16:16.535
Thank you, baby,
I know you are.

01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:19.138
I know you are.

01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:22.274
Can I get a hit of that?

01:16:22.308 --> 01:16:24.910
Got your fuckin' money?

01:16:24.944 --> 01:16:27.947
Well... most of it.

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:30.182
What's our deal?

01:16:30.216 --> 01:16:33.652
End of the month?

01:16:33.686 --> 01:16:35.287
Get in.

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.864
All the information you gave us
is really gonna help.

01:16:46.866 --> 01:16:49.802
We're gonna find her,
Rebecca.

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:52.671
You did the right thing.

01:16:52.705 --> 01:16:55.274
- Rebecca...
- I don't know, I just...

01:16:57.977 --> 01:17:02.048
I feel like I...
like I let her down.

01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:03.582
You know?

01:17:06.852 --> 01:17:08.154
I just...

01:17:09.955 --> 01:17:11.590
I abandoned her.

01:17:16.228 --> 01:17:18.631
She just needed help!

01:17:19.832 --> 01:17:21.267
Hey, Lo?

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.201
Yeah.

01:17:22.234 --> 01:17:23.836
Hey, we got a guy out here
talking about

01:17:23.869 --> 01:17:25.971
a missing girl?

01:17:33.813 --> 01:17:36.348
So, Saul.

01:17:38.884 --> 01:17:41.787
You think you could
tell it again?

01:17:49.261 --> 01:17:51.931
Come on, let's go.

01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:54.033
How do you want
to play this?

01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:55.801
Fuck! I can't get
this fucking gun

01:17:55.835 --> 01:17:58.037
in my waistband,
what the fuck?

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:59.171
Barry!

01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:00.339
What?

01:18:00.372 --> 01:18:02.875
Slow? I don't know!

01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:04.944
Let Saul lead again.

01:18:10.015 --> 01:18:11.884
I don't know.

01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:13.419
I'll take lead.

01:18:13.453 --> 01:18:15.955
Fine! Shit.

01:18:17.923 --> 01:18:19.258
Let's go.

01:18:45.151 --> 01:18:47.186
Saul!

01:18:48.854 --> 01:18:51.090
My God, I-I-I've been looking
everywhere for you!

01:18:51.123 --> 01:18:54.026
Sir, sorry to bother you
at such an hour.

01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:55.194
It's fine, it's fine.

01:18:55.227 --> 01:18:57.696
Saul!

01:18:57.730 --> 01:18:59.432
Wow!

01:18:59.466 --> 01:19:01.800
You look good.

01:19:01.834 --> 01:19:04.036
Little skinny maybe,
but, uh...

01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.738
yeah, good.

01:19:05.771 --> 01:19:08.174
Dan... can I call you "Dan"?

01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:10.176
Daniel is-is fine.

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:12.178
Daniel.

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:13.312
Can we come in?

01:19:15.181 --> 01:19:16.382
Who's your friend?

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:19.852
We need to talk
about Shelly.

01:19:26.493 --> 01:19:28.794
All right. Come in.

01:19:28.827 --> 01:19:29.929
The wife's asleep, though,

01:19:29.962 --> 01:19:31.263
so just kinda keep it down,
all right?

01:19:37.036 --> 01:19:39.472
So, uh, Saul.

01:19:39.506 --> 01:19:42.074
What's it been, uh,
10, 12 years?

01:19:42.107 --> 01:19:43.510
Watch your head.

01:19:43.543 --> 01:19:44.944
Fifteen.

01:19:44.977 --> 01:19:47.112
Fifteen years!

01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:51.817
Wow! Uh, I just, uh...
I can't even, uh...

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:53.285
Where's Shelly?

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:56.021
What?

01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:58.257
Sh-Shelly's missing,
we can't find her.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:01.160
Shel... Shelly's missing?

01:20:01.193 --> 01:20:03.496
How long has he...
she been missing?

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:05.397
You don't know
where she is?

01:20:05.432 --> 01:20:06.398
No!

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:09.368
No, no, I...

01:20:09.401 --> 01:20:11.804
Can I show you something?

01:20:15.808 --> 01:20:18.478
King's always been
a lazy piece of shit, so...

01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:21.481
I knew I couldn't count on him
to find the two of you.

01:20:21.514 --> 01:20:24.484
So, uh, even before
he pussied out on me,

01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:26.285
I hired this private eye,
you know?

01:20:26.318 --> 01:20:28.854
And, uh...

01:20:28.887 --> 01:20:32.324
Shit, I know it's here...
there it is.

01:20:32.358 --> 01:20:33.859
Yeah, so this is
basically everything

01:20:33.892 --> 01:20:37.530
I've been able to collect
on Jos... um, Shelly.

01:20:39.231 --> 01:20:42.435
As near as I can tell,
he... she was, uh,

01:20:42.469 --> 01:20:45.271
staying somewhere
not too far from here

01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:48.007
with some fella
named Francis?

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.076
- That's me.
- Yeah?

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:57.216
I-I-I... I'd really like
to see him... her again.

01:20:57.249 --> 01:20:59.385
If you find her, can you

01:20:59.418 --> 01:21:01.287
tell her to contact me?

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.921
I don't think so.

01:21:02.955 --> 01:21:04.356
What? Wha...

01:21:07.393 --> 01:21:09.061
Did you tell them?

01:21:24.611 --> 01:21:28.080
Look, uh... I know.

01:21:28.113 --> 01:21:31.050
I know that, uh,
that I did wrong

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.151
by the two of you.

01:21:32.184 --> 01:21:33.218
I-I know.

01:21:36.922 --> 01:21:40.392
I don't deserve it, Saul,
but...

01:21:40.426 --> 01:21:42.027
if you could just find
some way in your heart

01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:43.362
to forgive...

01:21:43.395 --> 01:21:45.331
Jesus! What the fuck?

01:21:55.608 --> 01:21:58.243
What is going on? Daniel?

01:21:58.277 --> 01:21:59.311
Daniel!

01:21:59.345 --> 01:22:00.447
Francis.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.581
Francis!
We gotta go.

01:22:01.614 --> 01:22:02.449
We gotta go now!

01:22:02.482 --> 01:22:04.016
Daniel!

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:06.085
What the... who the...
who are you?

01:22:06.118 --> 01:22:07.620
What are you doing here?

01:22:07.654 --> 01:22:08.987
Daniel.

01:22:09.021 --> 01:22:10.356
Daniel!

01:22:12.492 --> 01:22:14.093
Oh my God!

01:22:14.126 --> 01:22:16.395
Oh my God, Daniel,
are you all right?

01:22:16.428 --> 01:22:20.600
Oh... oh my God,
oh my God, ohh!

01:22:20.633 --> 01:22:24.437
Someone do something,
someone do something!

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:26.573
Oh my God!

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.484
Gimme your gun, Saul.

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:39.284
Gimme the gun!

01:22:42.522 --> 01:22:43.956
Are you coming?

01:22:43.989 --> 01:22:46.291
No! He's not.

01:23:39.244 --> 01:23:41.380
How's your food?

01:23:41.413 --> 01:23:44.416
I don't even know
how you can eat right now.

01:23:44.451 --> 01:23:47.986
Well, threw up, for one.

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:52.324
For two, I was told you should
eat through stuff like this.

01:23:52.357 --> 01:23:54.326
Who told you that?

01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:56.428
My aunt.

01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:59.331
My dad was killed
when I was a kid.

01:23:59.364 --> 01:24:01.734
Shot right outside my house.

01:24:01.768 --> 01:24:03.402
Cops?

01:24:03.436 --> 01:24:08.207
Nah. My mom.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.175
My aunt, she actually
brought me here

01:24:10.209 --> 01:24:11.744
right after that.

01:24:13.746 --> 01:24:15.782
Shit.

01:24:15.815 --> 01:24:19.084
I just noticed
I'm not even hungry.

01:24:19.117 --> 01:24:21.086
She brought me here a lot.

01:24:23.422 --> 01:24:24.691
Shit!

01:24:24.724 --> 01:24:26.459
What?

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.596
I know where Shelly is.

01:25:17.544 --> 01:25:19.779
Fuck.

01:25:19.812 --> 01:25:21.514
Fuck!

01:25:30.155 --> 01:25:32.090
What are you doing?

01:25:32.124 --> 01:25:33.793
Calling the police.

01:25:33.826 --> 01:25:35.595
No.

01:25:35.628 --> 01:25:37.564
What? We found her.

01:25:37.597 --> 01:25:39.465
Let's just fucking end it.

01:25:39.499 --> 01:25:41.266
No.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.436
Fuck you, Barry!

01:25:43.469 --> 01:25:46.673
You're not thinkin,
Francis.

01:25:46.706 --> 01:25:49.408
This whole fucking thing
was pointless, Barry.

01:25:49.442 --> 01:25:50.309
It was for nothing.

01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:52.344
She's been here
the entire fucking time!

01:25:52.377 --> 01:25:53.713
Just end it.

01:25:53.746 --> 01:25:55.548
We'll call in
an anonymous tip.

01:25:55.582 --> 01:25:56.716
No.

01:25:59.318 --> 01:26:01.788
All right. Fine.

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:06.191
But I can't wait to hear
how you explain to the police

01:26:06.224 --> 01:26:08.828
why Fat Dan was killed
with your gun.

01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:19.171
Fuck!

01:26:19.204 --> 01:26:21.841
- Fuck.
- Look.

01:26:21.874 --> 01:26:24.744
There's a pay phone
not too far from here.

01:26:24.777 --> 01:26:27.212
We can call it in from there.

01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:30.917
I'm sorry.

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:33.151
Come on, man.

01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:37.724
I'm sorry.

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:38.885
Hey.

01:27:40.687 --> 01:27:44.389
Hey, uh... Sam?

01:27:44.423 --> 01:27:45.758
Hey, what's up?

01:27:48.326 --> 01:27:53.466
I-I-I'm fine, uh...
are you okay?

01:27:53.499 --> 01:27:55.501
Fine.

01:27:56.903 --> 01:27:58.871
Are, uh...

01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:00.405
are you with Paul?

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.574
Yeah.

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:09.782
Oh, um... yeah,
is he okay?

01:28:09.816 --> 01:28:11.684
He's fine.

01:28:11.718 --> 01:28:14.487
Happy, healthy.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.824
Francis, what's going on?

01:28:17.857 --> 01:28:19.726
I, um...

01:28:19.759 --> 01:28:23.428
I mean, we...

01:28:23.463 --> 01:28:25.732
uh...

01:28:25.765 --> 01:28:27.299
Did you...

01:28:27.332 --> 01:28:30.770
Uh, she, uh...

01:28:30.803 --> 01:28:32.939
- ...she...
- Francis.

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:40.947
I let her down, Sam.

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.484
I'm so sorry!

01:28:44.517 --> 01:28:47.887
I killed her!

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.656
She's dead because of me,
I could...

01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:54.727
I could have done something,
but I didn't.

01:28:54.761 --> 01:28:57.797
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:59.732
I'm so sorry.

01:29:34.767 --> 01:29:36.936
Francis.

01:29:36.969 --> 01:29:38.704
Yeah?

01:29:38.738 --> 01:29:40.506
We could take
another minute, man.

01:29:42.942 --> 01:29:45.645
No. Let's go.

01:29:47.947 --> 01:29:48.581
Take a seat.

01:29:48.614 --> 01:29:50.750
I'll get you in a minute.

01:29:50.783 --> 01:29:52.685
Set him up
with a whiskey.

01:29:52.718 --> 01:29:55.621
- It's nine in the morning!
- Just do it.

01:29:59.525 --> 01:30:00.660
Barry!

01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:04.931
How'd it go?

01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:06.899
It went like shit.

01:30:06.933 --> 01:30:09.401
- We found her, though.
- Good, okay.

01:30:09.435 --> 01:30:11.369
So where was she?

01:30:11.403 --> 01:30:13.105
Overdose.

01:30:13.139 --> 01:30:14.073
- She had a spot by the river...
- Jesus fuck!

01:30:14.106 --> 01:30:16.108
...I guess.

01:30:16.142 --> 01:30:18.578
- She's dead.
- Shit!

01:30:18.611 --> 01:30:19.745
Yeah.

01:30:21.981 --> 01:30:24.150
How 'bout the other thing?

01:30:24.183 --> 01:30:26.953
Well, Francis is covering
Saul's debt.

01:30:26.986 --> 01:30:28.420
King's in a bind,

01:30:28.454 --> 01:30:29.856
so I have to go back.

01:30:31.757 --> 01:30:33.926
So how did he do?

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.562
He did good, considering.

01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:38.898
Oh. Fat Dan's dead.

01:30:38.931 --> 01:30:40.666
Wait. Why?

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.534
Saul killed him.

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:44.503
- Shot him in the head.
- Why, though?

01:30:44.537 --> 01:30:46.138
You remember that shit
Saul always talkin' about?

01:30:46.172 --> 01:30:47.540
Yeah?

01:30:47.573 --> 01:30:49.609
I don't think
it was all talk.

01:30:49.642 --> 01:30:50.877
Hm.

01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:54.647
Thomas, he really did a number
on Francis' apartment, too.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.582
Well, that validates
my firing him.

01:30:56.616 --> 01:30:57.750
Good.

01:30:59.719 --> 01:31:01.888
I'm thinking of giving
the kid the job.

01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:03.456
Francis?

01:31:03.489 --> 01:31:05.124
Yeah. Think he'd go for it?

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.463
Honestly?

01:31:10.496 --> 01:31:12.798
Every time I think I know
what he's gonna do next,

01:31:12.832 --> 01:31:14.200
he surprises me.

01:31:14.233 --> 01:31:15.534
Okay.

01:31:15.568 --> 01:31:16.569
Why don't you
give me a minute

01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:17.937
and then send him in?

01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:19.605
Gonna drink that?

01:31:21.641 --> 01:31:22.775
Fuck!

01:31:28.781 --> 01:31:30.449
He's ready for you.

01:33:46.852 --> 01:33:49.588
Little farther,
little farther...

01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:51.090
there you go.

01:34:04.637 --> 01:34:05.805
Hey.

01:34:05.838 --> 01:34:08.307
- Did they...
- They called.

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.675
Okay.

01:34:11.677 --> 01:34:13.079
What's going on?

01:34:15.014 --> 01:34:18.184
There's, uh, $400 there.

01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:19.752
Francis.

01:34:19.785 --> 01:34:20.920
I got a new job.

01:34:20.953 --> 01:34:22.354
There should be
more money coming in.

01:34:24.924 --> 01:34:26.926
- You don't have to...
- I do.

01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:29.095
I really do, I...

01:34:29.128 --> 01:34:30.763
I wanna provide
for you and Paul.

01:34:34.434 --> 01:34:36.669
Okay.

01:34:36.702 --> 01:34:38.637
Do you wanna come in?

01:34:40.773 --> 01:34:42.074
Another time.

01:34:42.108 --> 01:34:44.210
You sure?

01:34:44.243 --> 01:34:45.277
See you, Sam.
