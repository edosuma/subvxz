WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:07.007
*

00:18.519 --> 00:20.054
Sure this is
a good idea?
Totally.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.390
Got them from Froomie,
who said they're safe.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.125
You trust a guy named Froomie?

00:29.663 --> 00:32.166
What was that?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.335
Probably nothing.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.437
Nothing?

00:37.238 --> 00:38.372
BOY:
Did we do that?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.241
You're an idiot.
So is Froomie.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.581
BOY:
Holy crap.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.853
I'll get a hose.
Aah!

00:52.886 --> 00:55.523
Come on, come on, hurry!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
Chas, there's someone in there!

00:57.258 --> 00:59.227
Go inside, get him out!

01:00.328 --> 01:02.496
Go! What you are waiting for?

01:02.530 --> 01:04.565
CHAS:
It's no use. The guy, he...

01:04.598 --> 01:06.600
he's dead.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.302
GIRL:
What?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.639
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:11.672 --> 01:14.275
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:14.308 --> 01:16.777
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:16.810 --> 01:18.279
* How, how, how, how

01:18.312 --> 01:20.448
* Hey, hey

01:26.287 --> 01:27.655
* You gotta come on.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.591
*

01:30.624 --> 01:31.725
PRIDE:
Ready, music major?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.327
Totally.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.829
* I wonder where
my friend has gone... *

01:35.863 --> 01:38.266
Is this the...

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
Old Trutone.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.869
Where Grandma
used to sing?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.508
Used to sneak in.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.843
Tuck into this corner
right here.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.183
Man, your grandma had soul.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.786
Gave Billie Holiday
a run for her money.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.654
Oh...

02:01.955 --> 02:03.291
Still kind of

02:03.324 --> 02:05.826
a work in progress.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.296
No, it's amazing.
It'll be more amazing

02:08.329 --> 02:10.164
when you and I

02:10.198 --> 02:11.832
can jam in here together.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.667
So, you tell Mom
about this place?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.469
Mentioned it.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.905
And did she mention Carl?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.740
Guy who's taking her
to the Bahamas?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.209
Carl Walsh?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.643
Investment banker?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.278
Works for Loeb and Wexler?

02:24.312 --> 02:25.546
No priors?

02:25.579 --> 02:26.680
Minimum parking violations?
That Carl?

02:26.714 --> 02:28.816
Of course,
you ran his background.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.651
Wanted to make sure
she'd be safe.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.220
Is that all you were doing?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.261
Done in by the dead.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.195
Let's go.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.663
Oh, is it okay if I hang out?

02:42.696 --> 02:43.897
Soak it all in?

02:43.931 --> 02:46.200
Lock up
when you go.

02:46.234 --> 02:49.237
* Better off if

02:49.270 --> 02:53.974
* He was coming home

02:54.007 --> 02:59.280
* Better off if
he was coming home. *

03:00.881 --> 03:02.783
BRODY: Victim was found
in the burning trailer.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.252
PRIDE:
Trailer belongs to...?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.819
It's a navy rental.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.288
Called the housing office.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.889
Waiting to hear back.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.358
Kids found the body.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.425
Called the cops
in a panic,

03:11.459 --> 03:12.660
thinking they had
caused the fire.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.428
Did they?
Negatory!

03:14.462 --> 03:15.896
Fire marshals
found this.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.299
Some type of
incendiary device.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.301
Room was soaked
with kerosene.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.302
Arson.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.670
When Percy gets here,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.505
I'll have her canvass
for witnesses.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.408
Uh, no Percy. She's got a week
of counterintelligence training.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.009
She's gone?
Yep.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.611
I, uh, pulled the screws
out of her chair

03:30.644 --> 03:32.780
so she'd fall down
when she sits in it.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.615
And I swapped all her pens
with disappearing ink.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.251
Brody, let the kids off
with a warning.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.852
Chris, you're with me.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.421
Morning, Loretta.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.391
What we got?
Caucasian male, late 20s.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.561
Remnants of a wallet.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.430
Rear pocket.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.299
Burned to a crisp.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.335
But I've got something
that might interest you.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.837
Looks like a crown, yeah?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.611
That's Royal Australian Navy.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.447
Guy seems lost
by about 9,000 miles.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.284
BRODY: Our victim is
Lieutenant Lachlan Colston

04:10.318 --> 04:11.785
of Melbourne, here as a part

04:11.819 --> 04:13.887
of the Navy's
Personnel Exchange Program.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.425
Allied sailors from around
the globe switch places with

04:17.458 --> 04:19.360
an American counterpart
of similar rank

04:19.393 --> 04:20.728
for one year.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.330
In this case,
Colston life-swapped

04:22.363 --> 04:23.864
with a Lieutenant
Brad Ryder.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.866
Both men worked logistics.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.535
And the trailer
Colston was living in

04:27.568 --> 04:29.403
belonged to
Ryder as well.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.439
We know what Colston
was working on specifically?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.040
Details are
compartmented.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.876
Information is being controlled
by the Royal Australian Navy.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.312
We're trying to get read in,
but the Aussies aren't talking.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.381
And cue my entrance.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.051
Naomi Parsons, Australia Defense
Force Investigative Services.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.986
Australia?
Yeah.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.457
Got here fast.
I was on assignment
in your capital.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.625
I just hopped on
the early flight.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.729
Oh, that will be
your director,
Agent Pride,

04:55.763 --> 04:57.798
confirming my
participation.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.733
Pride here.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.836
So... I am...

05:02.870 --> 05:05.005
Special Agent
Christopher Lasalle?

05:05.038 --> 05:06.474
Spent seven years
at NOPD Vice.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.075
And also you have received

05:08.108 --> 05:10.411
multiple commendations
for your work at the New Orleans

05:10.444 --> 05:13.414
Children's Hospital. You
must be Agent Merideth Brody,

05:13.447 --> 05:16.417
youngest special agent in the
history of the Midwest Office

05:16.450 --> 05:17.885
of NCIS.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.354
I just like to be thorough.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.390
Appears you are
who you say you are.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.757
Well, that's a relief.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.826
So let's get started.

05:25.859 --> 05:29.062
Lieutenant Colston
was part of a team conducting

05:29.096 --> 05:31.365
high-level negotiations
between our countries.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.835
Negotiations that would allow
U.S. Minuteman missiles

05:34.868 --> 05:36.470
in the Cocos Islands.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.138
Nuclear warheads?
PRIDE:
Tactical response

05:38.171 --> 05:40.374
to a potential
Chinese air strike.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.776
Colston's plan was
the linchpin of

05:42.810 --> 05:45.713
any agreement between our
countries, and without him...

05:45.746 --> 05:48.582
Talks stall.
More than stall.
They fall apart.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.684
Now, my thesis is that

05:50.718 --> 05:53.621
he was murdered
to scuttle a treaty

05:53.654 --> 05:55.456
between our two countries.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.424
We'll need to compile a list

05:56.457 --> 05:59.427
of any groups or countries

05:59.460 --> 06:02.496
that would have a reason
to not want the U.S.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.764
to be in the Cocos Islands.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.132
And also, love it

06:05.165 --> 06:06.133
if we could contact
your State Department

06:06.166 --> 06:09.036
to get an update
on the status of those talks.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.771
Okay, Investigator Parsons,
I feel...
You know, I would

06:10.804 --> 06:12.440
also seriously love
a cappuccino.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.041
Is that your kitchen?

06:14.074 --> 06:17.010
I'm gonna help myself.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.046
What the hell
was that?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.849
That was what
my mother would call...

06:21.882 --> 06:25.819
a tornado riding
on the back of a hurricane.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.635
Agent Lasalle talked
to the State Department.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.037
Cocos Island negotiations...

06:44.071 --> 06:46.807
Are highly secretive with a
small delegation of diplomats.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.076
Chinese are
the obvious suspects.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.011
Of course,
Pakistan, Indonesia.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.613
Frankly half
the developed world...

06:52.646 --> 06:55.983
Has a stake
in these talks.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.818
Oh, I cut you off, didn't I?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.487
Couple of times there.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.222
I do that sometimes. Sorry.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.224
Appreciate that you're aware.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.195
There's that Southern politeness
you're famous for, Agent Pride.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.130
Am I famous?

07:10.163 --> 07:13.701
Second highest arrest record
in Jefferson Parish history.

07:13.734 --> 07:17.605
Top marks
from NCIS Headquarters.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.072
You're from Sydney, right?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.074
Mm-hmm.
My Aunt Effie went

07:21.108 --> 07:22.676
to Sydney once.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.977
Said the people were real nice.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.815
Was big on etiquette, Effie.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.751
When she came to visit,
she brought pastry.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.922
Took her shoes off at the door,
helped out with the chores.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.825
You saying you want me
to be a good guest, Agent Pride?

07:37.858 --> 07:40.127
Please and thank you.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.898
Our local
medical examiner.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.900
She's finished the autopsy.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.638
If I promise to be like
Aunt Effie, can I tag along?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.009
Please and thank you?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.949
WADE:
As you can see,
the body's very badly burned.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
We still looking
at smoke inhalation?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.586
Well, that would require

08:05.619 --> 08:06.820
functioning lungs,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.822
which I no longer think
Lieutenant Colston had.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.891
Could find no evidence
of swelling

08:10.924 --> 08:12.860
or damage
to the respiratory tract.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.696
I did, however,
discover this

08:15.729 --> 08:19.700
perforation in the anterior and
posterior wall of what remains

08:19.733 --> 08:21.802
of the left heart ventricle.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.270
Murder weapon?

08:23.303 --> 08:24.872
Judging by the
depth and length

08:24.905 --> 08:27.875
of penetration,
I'd wager a knife

08:27.908 --> 08:31.244
at least six inches in length,
sawback edge.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.814
So, someone stabs Colston,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.950
douses his body in kerosene,

08:36.984 --> 08:39.553
leaves an incendiary device
behind...

08:39.587 --> 08:40.888
To cover his tracks.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.823
Missed one step,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.124
which I almost did because

08:44.157 --> 08:45.759
the distal phalanges

08:45.793 --> 08:47.995
of both his hands
and feet had almost

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
turned to ash, but I believe

08:49.963 --> 08:53.233
Lieutenant Colston had
his right index finger cut off

08:53.266 --> 08:55.903
by the weapon
that stabbed him.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.738
Murderer took a trophy.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.573
Yeah, and it's happened
before.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.108
Oh, this is
Sebastian Lund...

09:01.141 --> 09:03.677
Lund, forensic scientist,
undergrad at Penn.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.979
Graduate Degree from MIT,
and you also have

09:06.013 --> 09:08.048
a pretty tricked-out Web site
on the Illuminati.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.317
Um...
PRIDE:
Investigator

09:10.350 --> 09:12.753
Naomi Parsons
from the R.A.N.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.921
Oh.
She likes

09:13.954 --> 09:15.589
to be thorough.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.990
:
Two men enter,

09:17.024 --> 09:18.158
one man leaves.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.129
Thunderdome?
WADE:
Sebastian,

09:22.162 --> 09:23.897
you were saying?
I was saying.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.232
Thank you. Yes. I've found

09:25.265 --> 09:26.900
two cases in the
last three years,

09:26.934 --> 09:28.869
both with the same
modus operandi.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.938
Stab, burn the evidence,

09:30.971 --> 09:33.941
remove the index finger
with a six-inch sawback blade.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.810
Your killer
has done this before.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.881
BRODY:
Shirley Pappas was due
to testify

09:40.914 --> 09:43.817
against her employer
Lou Sussman in 2013.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.287
Sussman was a physician accused
of bogus billing practices.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.389
Shirley's testimony
would have put him away,

09:49.422 --> 09:52.292
but she was murdered before
trial, and Sussman walked.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.627
In 2014,

09:53.661 --> 09:55.262
Fred Brower was killed

09:55.295 --> 09:57.297
two weeks
after his estranged wife

09:57.330 --> 10:00.067
took out a $1 million
life insurance policy on him.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.002
There's no apparent link
between either of the victims.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.403
And no links to Colston?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.639
NOPD suspects they both were
murder-for-hire jobs,

10:05.673 --> 10:07.107
but can't prove it.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.376
Okay, where does one hire
a hit man in New Orleans?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.344
PATTON:
Let Triple P paint you
a picture.

10:11.378 --> 10:15.115
See, the Dark Web is a cesspool
of sin and temptation,

10:15.148 --> 10:18.085
beyond the reach
of the ordinary Dick and Jane.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.087
How do you
get access?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.789
Well, in layman terms,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.791
you need special software
and password.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.325
Dude or dudettes in the know--

10:25.358 --> 10:28.295
they can shop for guns, drugs,
and all kind of icky sex.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.663
Hit men.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.264
Oh, yeah, baby.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.867
Tons of advertising
for dirty deeds done dirt cheap.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.137
I did some pokey-poke around--
look what I found.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.207
NAOMI:
"Hit man for hire.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.209
St. Mary to St. Bernard"?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.344
Parishes in Southern Louisiana.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.879
Our version of a county.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.414
Check out the knife.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.783
Sawback edge.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.451
So, how do we get to him?
We order up a hit.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.020
Give me a couple of hours.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.191
LAUREL:
I'm taking this B.B. King.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.961
You're leaving
the B.B. King.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.963
"Sweet Little Angel"?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.766
You used to sing
that to me every night.

11:05.799 --> 11:09.036
Which is why it's staying mine.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.107
Your mother?
Yep.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.710
She having fun?

11:16.744 --> 11:19.346
She's going scuba diving.
Oh.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.449
Tell her not to feed any sharks.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.253
So, you're
really okay with this?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.221
Mom and a guy

11:28.255 --> 11:29.456
named Carl?

11:29.489 --> 11:32.392
Just want her to be happy.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.927
Well, I want you
both to be happy.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.329
I'm happy. Got you.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.464
Bar.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.466
Work.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.400
Work is work.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.735
Bar is just more work.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.136
When do you have time for...

11:43.170 --> 11:45.038
something else?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.241
I'm the father.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.376
You're the daughter.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.911
My job to worry about you.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.981
Daughters are allowed
to worry, too.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.483
Thank you.
You're welcome.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.018
See, somebody else gets it.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.820
Update on our hit men.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.388
Mr. P set a drop
for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow--

12:01.421 --> 12:04.024
$10,000 cash, Armstrong Park.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.760
It's Triple P.

12:06.794 --> 12:10.263
And you need me
to authorize the money.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.365
I was just trying
to be efficient.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.503
Leave the B.B. King, daughter.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.740
*

12:24.311 --> 12:26.046
PRIDE:
Comm check.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.781
Loud and clear.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.416
Lima, Charlie.
PRIDE: Good and good.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.451
Thank you.
Leave 'em open.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.487
Now we wait.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.123
We could
pass the time

12:36.156 --> 12:39.226
with another
folksy allegory.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.128
Well, try this one on for size,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.763
Naomi Adele Parsons.

12:45.565 --> 12:46.967
Born in Brisbane.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.202
Graduated top of her class,
Melbourne Law.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.205
Six years at a prestigious
trust and wills firm...

12:52.239 --> 12:54.407
before quitting
to enlist in the Navy.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.444
Yeah, that sounds
vaguely familiar.
Mm-hmm.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.913
I can be thorough, too.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.816
Follow up?

13:02.850 --> 13:04.284
If you must.

13:04.317 --> 13:08.021
Why would someone
leave a six-figure gig

13:08.055 --> 13:10.223
less than one year
before making partner?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.359
I didn't see myself
that way anymore.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.996
How do you
see yourself, exactly?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.536
Got a Dumpster diver.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.007
Movement at the drop.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.377
African-American
male, hoodie,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.113
five-seven.
Suspect has the envelope.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.617
I've lost
visual contact.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.888
No worries. We got Agent Lasalle
and Brody on the backside.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.891
I'm losing him.
Damn it.
Move now!

13:44.892 --> 13:45.959
Everyone, move now!

13:48.395 --> 13:50.864
Stop!

13:50.898 --> 13:53.066
Aah!

13:53.100 --> 13:54.534
Don't move a muscle!

13:54.567 --> 13:56.436
Go easy, babe.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.305
Palms up!
They up.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.073
Ross P.?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.641
Lasalle?

14:01.674 --> 14:04.912
Man, get
Crocodile Dandee up off me.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.313
I-I give.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.916
Go easy on him,
Parsons. We know him.

14:08.949 --> 14:12.085
This could be our hit man.
Highly unlikely.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.625
More likely that
was our hit man. And you just

14:18.658 --> 14:20.160
scared him off.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.595
LASALLE:
What's going on, Ross P.?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.031
Like I told you before--

14:24.064 --> 14:25.632
I got sprung a few weeks ago.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.968
My P.O. said I need a job.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.538
Pope was taken,
so I applied for GopherU.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.373
What the hell's GopherU?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.375
People, they pay you
for all kind of odd jobs.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.609
You know? Pick up
prescriptions,

14:36.643 --> 14:38.211
drop off their laundry.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.313
Grab envelopes
out of trash cans?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.015
I mean, I ain't picky.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.516
The client.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.651
Who was it?

14:44.684 --> 14:46.219
No clue.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.687
I know his handle,
though, is, uh...

14:47.720 --> 14:49.389
Hunter28.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.625
All right. Where were you
supposed to deliver the package?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.062
Another trash can,
just a few blocks away.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.030
Come on, Ross P.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.631
Nothing good was ever delivered

14:58.665 --> 15:00.367
from one trash can to another.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.135
Come on, man. Of course
I knew it was shady,

15:02.169 --> 15:04.704
but, if you hadn't noticed,
my considerable

15:04.737 --> 15:07.207
skill set
doesn't exactly translate

15:07.240 --> 15:10.377
to the legit job market.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.946
Maybe with your help,
you know...

15:12.980 --> 15:14.982
Well, the last time I helped,

15:15.015 --> 15:17.150
you sold drugs behind my back.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.086
Don't be like that, Lasalle.
Look, I'm really trying

15:19.119 --> 15:21.254
to walk on the straight side
of the street here.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.623
I mean, a leopard
can change his stripes, huh?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.092
Only problem with that...

15:25.125 --> 15:26.559
is leopards have spots.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.361
Change those, too.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.664
You jumped the gun back there.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.169
May have lost us the
trail of our killer.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.338
Now, I'm sure you're under
all kinds of pressure

15:38.371 --> 15:39.572
from the R.A.N.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.274
You want to know
what my pressure is?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.609
Colston's wife

15:42.642 --> 15:45.012
and his two little girls,
Susie and Maureen.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.480
Six and eight years of age.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.516
They deserve to know
what happened to their dad.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.318
Trust me, we got
the same priorities

15:51.351 --> 15:52.986
on this side of the Pacific.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.022
But moving forward,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.224
you need to take it down
a notch.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.393
You need to work
on my terms.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.663
And you need to work unarmed.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.199
Give it up.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.639
Keep it coming.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.747
How about what's in the boot?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.591
That's all of it.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.627
Pleasure doing business
with you.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.733
Good news or bad?
Get the bad out of the way.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.569
GopherU's not cooperating.
Citing privacy issues. We're

16:42.602 --> 16:44.604
gonna have to play the whole
warrant dance to get anywhere.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.638
And the good?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.208
SUV speeding from the park--

16:48.241 --> 16:50.477
got the license plate
from a traffic cam.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.045
Registered to Phil Kasey,

16:52.079 --> 16:54.247
lives in Algiers.
Long list of felonies.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.217
Possession of explosives
and assault with a knife.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.753
Just like our hit man.
Let's go pay Mr. Kasey a visit.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.205
NCIS!

17:40.760 --> 17:42.229
Brody.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.264
I got something.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.808
Explosives.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.310
Could be what was used

17:57.344 --> 17:58.778
to start the fire
at Colston's trailer.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.781
Could be.
Look.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.616
Info on our other
murder victims.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.851
Fred Brower.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.455
Shirley Pappas.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.191
Here's a picture
of Colston.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.692
Wait a second.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.794
Ryder.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.529
Ryder is the Navy officer

18:16.563 --> 18:19.766
who traded places
with Colston.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.702
Ryder lived in the same trailer,
worked at the same office.

18:22.735 --> 18:26.273
Is it possible that our hit man
was hired to kill Ryder...

18:26.306 --> 18:28.308
But killed
Colston instead?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.388
Owner of the house
is Phil Kasey,

18:41.421 --> 18:43.523
former longshoreman
now on disability.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.926
Seem to moonlight
as a hit man on the Dark Web.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.396
Appears to be responsible
for at least three murders,

18:49.429 --> 18:51.298
including Lieutenant Colston.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.601
Yeah, we're thinking Colston
was not Kasey's target.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.469
Every piece of information
in the hit file

18:56.503 --> 18:57.937
corresponds to
Lieutenant Ryder.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.307
The American.
We found
explosive material

19:00.340 --> 19:01.941
at Kasey's home,
sent 'em over to Sebastian.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.478
Also found a laptop
that's been wiped clean.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.579
Patton's examining.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.515
We need to talk
to Lieutenant Ryder.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.583
Australian Central Command's
got him ready.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.520
I wanted to wait for you,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.422
this being your turf.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.891
Let's go get him up on SCIF.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.494
What is this, some kind of joke?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.330
Did Commander Wallace
put you up to this?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
No joke, Lieutenant.
You're saying

19:25.598 --> 19:27.500
the guy who I traded jobs with
was murdered?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.736
We're saying Lieutenant Colston
might have taken a knife

19:29.769 --> 19:32.339
because someone
thought he was you.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.506
There anyone in New Orleans

19:33.540 --> 19:35.275
who has issues with you,
Lieutenant Ryder?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.677
No, sir.
I pay my bills on time,

19:37.710 --> 19:40.580
open doors for strangers,
I mind my Ps and Qs.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.382
Besides, I was only
stationed there

19:42.415 --> 19:44.584
for 11 months
before my PEP transfer.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.355
I usually find 11 months
plenty of time to make enemies.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.757
Let us ask you this:

19:50.790 --> 19:53.626
we found a notebook
in the hit man's house.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.696
Three addresses
next to your name.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.498
Your trailer.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.368
Navy logistics office
on Dauphine Street.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.536
And an address
on Rampart Street.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.539
The Black Penny?
That's it.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.541
It's a music joint.
My... my girlfriend Cheryl--

20:08.575 --> 20:10.377
she gigs there
three nights a week.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.878
Is she in some kind of danger?

20:15.715 --> 20:18.885
* And now I'll never be

20:18.918 --> 20:23.290
* The same

20:23.323 --> 20:25.425
* Can't help but feeling

20:25.458 --> 20:28.495
* Like I've gone

20:28.528 --> 20:31.431
* To Heaven

20:31.464 --> 20:33.666
* And all this started

20:33.700 --> 20:36.603
* When you said

20:36.636 --> 20:40.907
* You loved me.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.881
Brad's not hurt, is he?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.517
Lieutenant Ryder's fine.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.852
This man-- Lieutenant Colston--

20:52.885 --> 20:54.554
not so lucky.
Current theory is,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.022
someone put a hit out on him.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.724
We think the
killer may have

20:57.757 --> 20:59.492
mistaken him for Ryder.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.660
That's... awful.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.429
Everything okay?

21:02.462 --> 21:06.333
Yeah.
Luke Elliott,
piano player.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.535
Should we be worried?
We don't think

21:08.568 --> 21:10.069
there's a current threat to you,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.372
but the address to the bar
was on the hit man's list.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.875
Brad practically lived here
when he was in New Orleans.

21:15.908 --> 21:19.011
He came every time we played
and stayed through all our sets.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.813
Our most loyal fan.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.415
Are you two still together?

21:22.449 --> 21:25.585
Yeah, but, you know,
long distance,

21:25.618 --> 21:27.554
time difference. Tough.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.557
Did anything out of the ordinary
happen in the past few weeks?

21:30.590 --> 21:33.493
Someone hanging around
that shouldn't be here?

21:34.561 --> 21:38.398
There was a guy
the other night-- he came in,

21:38.431 --> 21:40.467
sat at the bar,
stared at me.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.902
At the end of the show,
he came asking about Brad.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.070
What did he want?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.705
I don't know.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.441
But he said if I saw Brad,

21:48.475 --> 21:51.444
that he'd better contact
a guy named...

21:51.478 --> 21:53.746
"Sug... Sugar Wells?"

21:53.780 --> 21:55.448
Describe this Sugar fella.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.384
Um, African-American.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.751
Had tattoos
down his neck.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.487
Mohawk.
And, um...

22:00.520 --> 22:02.455
He had a gold grill
on his bottom teeth.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.057
Guy was scary as hell.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.429
So you're Sugar Wells.
In the flesh and bone.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.830
We hear you're the biggest

22:10.863 --> 22:12.432
online bookmaker
on the East Bank.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.634
I'm glad to see my reputation's

22:14.667 --> 22:16.469
still intact.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.538
Brad Ryder--

22:18.571 --> 22:19.839
he's a client of yours?
I have lots of clients.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.474
Yeah, well, this one
wears a Navy uniform--

22:21.508 --> 22:22.809
Lieutenant Brad Ryder.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.412
You can shove that picture
in my face all you want.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.113
I don't know faces.

22:27.146 --> 22:30.049
It's online bets
and online payments.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.385
Well, what about this?
Maybe this jogs your memory?

22:32.419 --> 22:34.387
That's just nasty.
That's what it looks like

22:34.421 --> 22:35.688
when a man don't pay his debts.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.425
Care to put the phone away?

22:38.458 --> 22:39.659
It's football season,

22:39.692 --> 22:41.561
my busy time.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.564
Yup.
Hey, man.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.165
Back to Ryder.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.535
Look, far as I know

22:48.568 --> 22:51.103
about his accounts,
the dude was like

22:51.137 --> 22:52.939
a hundred grand
in the hole.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.041
And he maxed out all
his credit cards.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.643
Ryder set up, "Pay My
Bills," not so much.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.044
After those cards
were maxed out,

22:58.077 --> 22:59.512
you went and threatened
his girlfriend.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.913
When you couldn't find him,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.715
you hired somebody
to take him out.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.451
Look, dead men don't pay.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.052
I took a loss with Ryder.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.888
Had to close all his accounts
when I heard he got killed.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.124
You heard he was killed?
Rumor had it he
was deep-fried.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.527
So I went by the
house, saw the char,

23:14.561 --> 23:16.496
which I had nothing to do with.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.764
Now could I get
that phone back?

23:17.797 --> 23:19.632
PRIDE:
Okay, Chris.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.000
Keep looking.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.437
So far, no connects between
Sugar Wells and our hit man.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.938
Still looking.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.007
Sounds like squeaky
clean Lieutenant Ryder

23:28.040 --> 23:29.776
lied to us about
a couple of things.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.578
The question is,
what else is he hiding?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.979
Well, I don't
know about Ryder,

23:33.012 --> 23:34.547
but your hit man
had massive quantities

23:34.581 --> 23:36.015
of ammonium nitrate,
nitrobenzene,

23:36.048 --> 23:38.518
baker's sugar and
aluminum powder in his house.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.454
Or aluminium powder
in your native tongue.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.022
Got some of it from
Kasey's hidden workshop,

23:43.055 --> 23:45.024
the rest from the Dumpster
outside of his house.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.026
You know,
people throw away a lot

23:47.059 --> 23:48.928
of really useful
stuff these days.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.733
I actually toyed with being
a freegan in college,

23:53.766 --> 23:56.869
but it turns out that female
anarchists rarely shower.

23:56.903 --> 23:57.670
NAOMI:
So, are these

23:57.704 --> 23:58.471
the items
that made the explosive

23:58.505 --> 24:00.840
that destroyed
Colston's trailer?

24:00.873 --> 24:02.942
Yeah, but, uh, given the amount
of scrap metal I found,

24:02.975 --> 24:04.210
I think it's safe to say

24:04.243 --> 24:06.245
that Kasey had made
multiple devices.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.647
Could be more than one bomb?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.181
Exactly, which is why

24:09.215 --> 24:11.651
I wanted
to show you this receipt.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.686
What's on it?

24:13.720 --> 24:17.490
Oh, uh, pizza grease, stale
beer, some kind of bodily fluid?

24:18.357 --> 24:20.793
You mean what's on it on it.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.029
It's a shipping receipt.
Package mailed yesterday

24:23.062 --> 24:25.197
to New South Wales, Australia.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.198
Where Ryder is stationed.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.067
What if Kasey realized

24:28.100 --> 24:29.569
that he killed the wrong man

24:29.602 --> 24:31.270
and wanted to make good
on the contract?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.572
By sending a mail bomb.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.841
We need to find that package.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.710
PRIDE:
According to the clerk,

24:37.744 --> 24:40.179
truck has one more stop
before heading to the airport.
Yeah, according

24:40.212 --> 24:42.715
to the tracker, I think you want
to take a left up ahead.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.218
Left. Left's gonna be
a little bit of a problem.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.655
Hang on.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.629
Federal agents.
Step out of the truck.

24:57.997 --> 25:02.134
(siren blaring,
garbled radio transmission)

25:02.168 --> 25:03.936
It's clean.
No explosive materials.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.972
Safe?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.907
Can't guarantee safe,
just that it won't blow up.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.276
Thank you.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.586
Oh, no.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.793
Got to be Colston's.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.260
On its way to Ryder?

25:29.896 --> 25:32.298
Proof of death.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.870
Ryder's deep in debts
that he can't pay.

25:37.904 --> 25:43.876
Suddenly, there's Colston living
in his trailer, living his life.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.878
And then Colston
ends up dead.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.279
But everyone thinks it's Ryder.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.749
Specifically, Sugar Wells,

25:49.782 --> 25:51.350
the guy he owed money to.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.721
It's convenient.
Or the point of it all.

25:54.754 --> 25:58.090
Your guy kills my guy, and
then all his problems go away.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.609
Loretta confirms the finger
belonged to Colston.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
Package was on its way
to Ryder in Australia.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.948
If Naomi is right, Ryder
put the hit out on Colston

26:21.981 --> 26:23.816
to get out from under
gambling debts.

26:23.850 --> 26:27.386
Big if. Still got to get our
hands on the hit man Kasey.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.387
Get a BOLO out.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.791
We need to get back
in the room with Ryder, too.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.926
Australian Central Command's
giving us the runaround.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.294
Access to Ryder
has been denied.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.063
What do you mean denied?
He's been detained

26:37.096 --> 26:39.365
for questioning in the murder
of Lachlan Colston.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.102
Give us a minute.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.876
You hijack my investigation,
you better have a good reason.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.879
My people have jurisdiction
over U.S. forces with respect

26:52.912 --> 26:55.381
to offenses committed
whilst inside Australia.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.850
I know the damn treaty.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.986
One of my countrymen
is being shipped home

27:00.019 --> 27:01.921
in a flag-draped box.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.857
And we're doing everything
we can to find out why.

27:04.891 --> 27:09.195
But this case
is a joint task force.
Not anymore.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.899
If Lieutenant Ryder arranged
a murder-for-hire plot

27:12.932 --> 27:16.202
while serving under the
R.A.N., my turf now.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.871
You want to withhold
access to Ryder.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.940
You want to make it

27:20.973 --> 27:23.910
your guy versus my guy.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.346
Then I got to question
your priorities.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.381
You do what you're gonna do,

27:29.415 --> 27:32.218
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're off this case.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.122
Someone's mad.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.725
Is it 'cause of
the pretty redhead?

27:38.758 --> 27:42.128
Yeah, she's pretty... something.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.164
Sounds like a certain brunette
I share a gene pool with.
Huh.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.934
No, not even
in the same area code.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.970
Look, your mother...

27:52.739 --> 27:54.907
One of a kind.

27:57.043 --> 28:00.379
But she's moved on,
and I'm okay with that.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.448
I'm also okay

28:02.481 --> 28:06.118
not rushing to replace her.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.955
I'm not asking you
to rush or replace.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.824
I just want to make sure
you're not using your work

28:11.858 --> 28:13.926
and the bar to... hide.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.999
I want to acknowledge
that daughters can worry,

28:20.032 --> 28:21.934
but they don't have to.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.908
I'm gonna be fine, promise.

28:28.941 --> 28:32.745
Anything useful
on the hit man's laptop?
Yeah.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.013
So, I found an
e-mail from whoever

28:34.046 --> 28:35.915
ordered the hit on Colston.
It was placed

28:35.948 --> 28:37.884
in the draft folder two days
after Colston was killed.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.019
"Final payment. Drop
off tomorrow same place

28:40.052 --> 28:41.954
as last time."
Where's last time?
I don't have that.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.057
Break in the case?

28:45.091 --> 28:46.993
No, more like a pain
in my ass.
Ugh.

28:47.026 --> 28:50.262
Find our where
"last time" was.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.131
Man, I don't do miracles, man.

28:52.164 --> 28:57.069
ROSS P.:
Took you long enough.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.138
Now can you please tell
this fine officer

28:59.171 --> 29:00.840
that we know each other?

29:00.873 --> 29:02.308
Maybe ditch these bracelets?

29:02.341 --> 29:03.943
Breaking and entering?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.277
Let me explain.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.979
This is not change, Ross P.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.347
It's a misunderstanding.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.949
Look, it's the same old crap.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.118
You messing up,
doing something stupid.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.353
Then you call me
to bail your tail out.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.822
You finished?

29:15.855 --> 29:18.324
Nope, but you are.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.293
Soon as I get your
parole officer on the phone.

29:21.327 --> 29:25.431
Whatever it is you stole,
I hope it was worth it.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.333
Why don't you
take a look?

29:27.366 --> 29:29.936
What'd he grab?

29:38.544 --> 29:41.981
You broke in
to GopherU's offices?

29:42.014 --> 29:45.818
You said I needed
to do you a solid.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.354
Stealing files...

29:48.387 --> 29:51.190
files that can't be used
in court--

29:51.223 --> 29:52.992
it's not a solid.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.827
I want to help you
catch a hit man.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.562
Look, man, I'm
not just a leopard

29:56.595 --> 29:58.297
changing his
spots, all right?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.900
I'm talking full-blown
evolution here.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.835
Uh, wings, a beak.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.937
Before you know it, I'm
gonna be a whole eagle.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.307
You're damn straight, eagle man.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.910
BRODY:
Based on these files,

30:10.943 --> 30:13.913
our hit man had GopherU pick
up a package for him here.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.082
I guess this is
the drop site.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.184
Means it's probably
where he was coming today

30:18.217 --> 30:20.419
for his final payment.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.191
BRODY:
Looks like

30:25.224 --> 30:28.060
he got his final payment,
all right.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.363
WADE:
Thank you.
A single gunshot

30:31.397 --> 30:35.034
to the chest, small caliber.
Victim died instantly.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.336
How long has he been here?
Judging by lividity,

30:37.369 --> 30:38.905
three hours, maybe less.

30:38.938 --> 30:39.838
We're right on the
killer's tail.

30:39.872 --> 30:43.075
Mm-hmm. Cell phone
ended up in the pool.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.643
LASALLE:
I'm sure Sebastian

30:44.676 --> 30:46.112
will squeeze
something out of it.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.247
How's Investigator Parsons?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.083
Benched. Unnecessary roughness.

30:51.117 --> 30:55.454
Ooh! Takes talent to get
under Dwayne Pride's skin.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.925
It seems our agent from down
under is quite a natural.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.262
PRIDE:
Headed home?

31:05.397 --> 31:07.466
I believe
that's where we left it.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.069
Found the hit man.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.338
Dead. Recent.

31:13.940 --> 31:17.643
We believe he was killed
by whomever hired him.

31:17.676 --> 31:21.180
And Ryder was still
in Australia.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.214
Yeah.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.482
Also, Ryder's credit cards

31:23.515 --> 31:25.985
appear to have been compromised.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.987
Someone else seems
to have gotten ahold

31:28.020 --> 31:29.655
of all of
the cards' numbers

31:29.688 --> 31:31.490
and made the bets
with Sugar Wells.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.993
So, again, not Ryder.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.397
Think he was just
an innocent victim.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.898
Like Colston.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.135
Wanted you to be able to update

31:43.169 --> 31:45.104
Colston's wife and his girls.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.412
Hey... I've got
a folksy story for you.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.084
There was this lawyer.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.618
Uh, expensive suits,

31:59.651 --> 32:03.322
fancy apartment
overlooking the Harbor.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.092
Her clients were all
one-percenters,

32:06.125 --> 32:07.960
before they even
called them that.

32:07.994 --> 32:08.995
And every time

32:09.028 --> 32:11.130
one of them would die,

32:11.163 --> 32:13.465
the vultures would come out
of the woodwork.

32:13.499 --> 32:14.967
Wives, exes,

32:15.001 --> 32:17.069
sons, daughters...

32:17.103 --> 32:19.438
just clamoring

32:19.471 --> 32:22.574
for their share of the stuff.

32:22.608 --> 32:27.013
Imagine that...
wore the lawyer out.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.251
So much so
that she began to drink.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.520
A lot more
than her five-foot-four,

32:34.553 --> 32:37.056
110-pound body could handle.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.590
And then, one day,

32:38.624 --> 32:43.062
she wakes up
behind the wheel of a car...

32:43.095 --> 32:47.066
just as she's about to run
over a seven-year-old girl.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.736
She missed.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.338
Lucky.
Yeah.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.107
And the very next day,

32:55.141 --> 32:57.576
she quit her job,
joined the Navy.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.413
Now, she's still hard-charging--

33:01.447 --> 33:04.016
maybe even more so--

33:04.050 --> 33:08.054
but when people's
loved ones die...

33:08.087 --> 33:10.289
she's there
to provide answers.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.425
And comfort and closure.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.761
I know that racket.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.069
Sebastian.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.570
Mr. Thunderdome?

33:26.738 --> 33:30.142
He's been working on
the hit man's phone.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.377
Thinks he's got
something.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.345
You should go.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.084
You should come with.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.788
Closure...

33:42.821 --> 33:45.124
it beckons.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.226
SEBASTIAN:
Did everything I could

33:47.259 --> 33:48.494
to resuscitate the phone.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.162
Started simple: paper towels,

33:50.196 --> 33:52.498
followed by the, uh,
bag of rice trick.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.166
Then, I had to operate.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.467
Opened up the casing,

33:55.501 --> 33:57.336
gave the internal mechanisms
a thorough vacuuming...

33:57.369 --> 33:59.505
But I'm afraid
it was no use.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.173
Phone died on
the operating table

34:01.207 --> 34:02.708
at 4:03 this afternoon.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.744
Then what are we doing here?

34:05.777 --> 34:07.546
'Cause I was able
to save the memory card.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.081
And?

34:09.115 --> 34:11.217
SEBASTIAN:
Photos... of Colston.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.087
PRIDE:
So hit man Kasey
was tracking Colston.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.522
SEBASTIAN:
For days. There's dozens
of photos like this.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.090
Hang on, is that...

34:18.124 --> 34:19.158
PRIDE:
Cheryl Eastman.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.227
NAOMI:
Ryder's girlfriend.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.395
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, there are a ton
with Colston and this girl.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.232
She lied to us.
Yeah.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.436
Question is why?

34:30.469 --> 34:33.472
And what does she have to
do with Colston's murder?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.621
You acted as if

34:49.655 --> 34:51.657
you didn't know Colston, Cheryl.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.364
Photos tell a different story.

34:58.397 --> 35:02.768
After Brad left,
we left it up in the air.

35:02.801 --> 35:06.872
But I got worried
things were going to end

35:06.905 --> 35:09.208
and I was lonely.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.510
Lachlan was
new in town,

35:11.543 --> 35:13.412
lonely, too,
so we started hanging out.

35:13.445 --> 35:17.549
Friends, but...
yeah, things got intense.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.387
It was a mistake.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.888
Which part?

35:22.921 --> 35:25.257
Scam on Ryder,
the seduction of Colston?

35:26.758 --> 35:28.227
The hit man?
Okay,
I swear...

35:28.260 --> 35:30.529
I got no clue

35:30.562 --> 35:32.198
what you're
talking about.
Really?

35:32.231 --> 35:33.299
Yeah.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.400
No clue?

35:36.768 --> 35:38.604
Well, a woman with no clue

35:38.637 --> 35:39.905
would have no problem
coming clean.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.274
Well, I didn't want
Brad to know.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.776
Burned up body in a trailer

35:44.810 --> 35:49.281
trumps an "up in the air"
relationship.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.317
In my opinion.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.918
Mine as well.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.953
So I...

35:54.986 --> 35:57.223
I think you have a clue.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.526
Little voice
in your head.

36:05.397 --> 36:08.400
Little voice saying something
you may not want to listen to.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.273
What's it saying to you, Cheryl?

36:15.574 --> 36:16.842
I don't understand.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.846
Why does this always happen?

36:22.714 --> 36:23.949
Why does what happen?

36:29.588 --> 36:30.822
Luke...

36:30.856 --> 36:32.424
says I'm cursed.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.593
Any time I get
close to someone--

36:34.626 --> 36:36.928
like, really start to care--

36:36.962 --> 36:39.831
something ruins it.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.933
Mike from, um...

36:41.967 --> 36:45.471
Nashville, he, uh,
got in a... car accident.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.938
And then Justin

36:46.972 --> 36:49.308
from Galveston...

36:49.341 --> 36:51.643
God, things are going great,
and then...

36:51.677 --> 36:54.613
all of a sudden just...
stops calling me.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.615
Freezes me out.

36:56.648 --> 37:00.419
Changed his number,
his e-mail.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.489
And now this.

37:05.023 --> 37:09.261
With Lachlan.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.696
And Brad.

37:12.798 --> 37:16.001
It sounds like you are awfully
unlucky in relationships.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.437
None of them stick.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.839
Except for one.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.009
Where were you?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.477
I was trying to call.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.346
Oh, NCIS,
they called me in.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.614
They had all sorts
of questions.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.015
Why

37:30.048 --> 37:31.550
Oh, nothing.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.685
I just stopped talking.
They assigned me a lawyer.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.954
Let's get out of here.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.489
You know?

37:37.523 --> 37:40.292
Go on the road, head to Florida,
pick up some gigs.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.793
Yeah. I, um...

37:41.827 --> 37:43.061
I want to go to Australia.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.996
See Brad.
Brad?

37:45.030 --> 37:46.765
Yeah.
After he left you?

37:46.798 --> 37:48.467
He didn't leave me,

37:48.500 --> 37:49.735
he just got assigned.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.437
He left, Cheryl.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.004
And the Lachlan guy?

37:53.038 --> 37:54.806
What kind of man screws
another man's girlfriend?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.042
Luke, that...
I-I just don't get it.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.810
These guys,
they're all the same.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.078
They get what
they want from you

38:00.111 --> 38:01.313
and then they're gone.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.581
Over and over again.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.950
And who's left?
Me. Always me.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.785
I'm the one
who takes care of you,

38:06.818 --> 38:08.454
but no matter how good I am,

38:08.487 --> 38:10.822
you-you don't see me
like you see them.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.960
What did you do, Luke?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.495
Nothing.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.830
You killed Lachlan.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.499
You set up Brad.

38:20.532 --> 38:23.435
You drove away every man
that has ever cared about me.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.504
To protect you.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.072
Oh, my God...
Those guys...

38:27.105 --> 38:31.109
they... they didn't care
about you.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.444
Not like I do.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.413
You're sick.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.947
Get away from me!
No, no, look...

38:35.981 --> 38:37.583
Let go of me!
Let me go!
Listen to me.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.650
Get away from me!
Just let me explain.

38:38.684 --> 38:39.551
Federal agents!

38:39.585 --> 38:41.587
Get your hands in the air!
Get 'em up!

38:48.960 --> 38:50.762
Hands on the roof.
On the roof!

38:50.796 --> 38:52.364
Got a gun.

38:52.398 --> 38:53.865
Got him
covered.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.001
Where'd you get the weapon?
NAOMI:
You disarmed me.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.369
I had to rearm.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.371
I'm thorough, remember?

39:00.572 --> 39:02.574
You're one for the books, lady.

39:04.743 --> 39:08.013
Think we have enough on
the wire for a confession?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.881
If not, I'll bet you
dollars to donuts

39:09.915 --> 39:11.417
the ballistics
from this gun

39:11.450 --> 39:14.386
will match the slug
taken out of the hit man.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.421
I'll do
the honors.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.122
Back at the office.
Got it, King.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.091
Hey, uh, I'm just gonna
step away and make a call.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.127
Sun's just coming up at home.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.597
Family should know.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.132
Closure.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.540
LASALLE:
You got it?

39:34.573 --> 39:35.974
ROSS P.:
Hold your damn horses.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.144
There you go.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.046
All right.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.881
Coax was bad,

39:42.914 --> 39:45.484
so I took the liberty
of rerouting the audio

39:45.517 --> 39:46.718
through the digital
optical port.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.787
I mean, know my tunes, man.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.056
That's more than I can say
for your cop work.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.123
Yeah.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.426
I learned my lesson
on that front.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.762
Guess I just have
to stick to being

39:56.795 --> 39:58.797
the handsomest handyman

39:58.830 --> 40:00.832
in the hippest bar
that ain't even open yet.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.468
A bar that's owned
by my best friend

40:02.501 --> 40:04.135
and my boss,

40:04.169 --> 40:05.437
which you got 'cause
I vouched for you.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.839
All right?

40:07.873 --> 40:10.442
So if you devolve from
an eagle into a rat...

40:10.476 --> 40:11.643
you gotta deal with me.

40:11.677 --> 40:12.978
Thought I was a leopard
or some damn thing.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.446
Wasn't I a leopard?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.082
Just turn it up,
Ross P.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.650
Come on,
turn it up!
Yeah!

40:18.684 --> 40:21.086
* Now wait just a second

40:21.119 --> 40:24.189
* I want to state
for the record... *

40:27.125 --> 40:28.494
Airport already?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.862
Probably be thrilled
to get rid of me.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.130
Oh, no,

40:32.163 --> 40:34.500
I wouldn't say that.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.068
Dwayne Pride.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.872
Former Jefferson Parish
Deputy Sheriff.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.909
Recently divorced,
with one child, Laurel,

40:43.942 --> 40:47.879
who suggested
that I mention...

40:47.913 --> 40:50.582
that I'm gonna be back in
the city in a couple of months.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.552
Is that what she suggested?

40:53.585 --> 40:55.487
Mmm. She's sharp, that one.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.856
Sharp... and insistent.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.124
Yep.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.761
Well... good.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.863
Good, 'cause I'm kind of
in the middle

41:04.896 --> 41:07.699
of a transition now, so...

41:07.733 --> 41:09.868
I know that racket.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.037
Well, I'm quite
sure you do.

41:12.070 --> 41:15.507
Well, you know, just...

41:15.541 --> 41:17.543
take your time.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.147
Pleasure doing business
with you, Parsons.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.117
The pleasure was mine...

41:26.151 --> 41:27.753
Agent Pride.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.991
Safe travels.
