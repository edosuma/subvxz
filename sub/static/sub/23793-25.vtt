>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.700 --> 00:34.467
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:34.533 --> 00:35.667
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.734 --> 00:36.533
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:36.600 --> 00:39.200
US.

00:39.266 --> 00:39.967
AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH

00:40.033 --> 00:40.900
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE MENTALLY

00:40.967 --> 00:41.567
UNSTABLE MAN WITH NUCLEAR

00:41.633 --> 00:42.567
WEAPONS WHO WE ALL LOVE MAKING

00:42.633 --> 00:44.333
ANGRY.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.500
NOW, NOW, BY HIS STANDARDS, THE

00:46.567 --> 00:48.233
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY HAD A PRETTY

00:48.300 --> 00:49.533
GOOD WEEK, AND IT SAYS SOMETHING

00:49.600 --> 00:50.867
ABOUT THOSE STANDARDS THAT A

00:50.934 --> 00:55.433
PRETTY GOOD WEEK FOR THIS

00:55.500 --> 00:56.767
PRESIDENT STILL INCLUDES A

00:56.834 --> 00:57.333
BLOCKBUSTER "NEW YORK TIMES"

00:57.400 --> 00:57.967
INVESTIGATION ABOUT HIM

00:58.033 --> 00:58.867
POSSIBLY HAVING COMMITTED TAX

00:58.934 --> 00:59.967
FRAUD, A STORY THAT YOU

01:00.033 --> 01:01.100
COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT UNTIL

01:01.166 --> 01:02.233
JUST NOW, AND ALSO THIS:

01:02.300 --> 01:03.533
>> YESTERDAY WHILE BOARDING

01:03.600 --> 01:06.200
AIR FORCE ONE IN MINNEAPOLIS...

01:06.266 --> 01:07.500
>> MM-MM, THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.834
>> SEE THERE ON HIS LEFT FOOT?

01:08.900 --> 01:10.500
COMMANDER IN CHIEF CLIMBING THE

01:10.567 --> 01:12.333
STAIRS WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE

01:12.400 --> 01:13.734
SOME TOILET PAPER STUCK TO HIS

01:13.800 --> 01:17.100
SHOE.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.467
>> John: NOW, WHILE THAT IS

01:18.533 --> 01:19.800
OBJECTIVELY FUNNY, IT'S ALSO

01:19.867 --> 01:23.033
COMPLETELY UNSURPRISING.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.100
ISN'T IT?

01:24.166 --> 01:24.967
AT THIS POINT, NO ONE WOULD BE

01:25.033 --> 01:25.867
SHOCKED IF HE BOARDED

01:25.967 --> 01:26.667
AIR FORCE ONE WITH AN ENTIRE

01:26.734 --> 01:27.934
TOILET STUCK TO HIS SHOE.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.500
IT WOULD BE TOTALLY ON BRAND.

01:30.567 --> 01:31.900
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE BIG NEWS THIS

01:31.967 --> 01:32.967
WEEK WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHO

01:33.033 --> 01:34.066
WAS CONFIRMED TO THE

01:34.133 --> 01:35.266
SUPREME COURT YESTERDAY.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.000
HIS CONFIRMATION WAS ALL BUT

01:37.066 --> 01:40.200
GUARANTEED THE MOMENT THAT

01:40.266 --> 01:41.533
SUSAN COLLINS ANNOUNCED THAT SHE

01:41.600 --> 01:42.467
WAS VOTING "YES," A DECISION

01:42.533 --> 01:43.600
DESCRIBED DISGUSTINGLY BY THE

01:43.667 --> 01:45.433
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" OP-ED PAGE

01:45.500 --> 01:47.133
AS "SUSAN COLLINS CONSENTS,"

01:47.200 --> 01:48.467
WHICH IS THEIR SINGLE-MOST

01:48.533 --> 01:50.734
GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE HEADLINE

01:50.800 --> 01:51.600
SINCE 1963'S "KENNEDY BLOWS HIS

01:51.667 --> 01:55.133
TOP."

01:55.200 --> 01:56.900
AND WHILE MANY WERE CONCERNED

01:56.967 --> 01:59.066
ABOUT HOW THIS DECISION WOULD

01:59.133 --> 02:00.367
AFFECT CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD,

02:00.433 --> 02:02.266
WHO TESTIFIED SO BRAVELY LAST

02:02.333 --> 02:05.133
WEEK, THE PRESIDENT, WHO HAD

02:05.200 --> 02:06.700
PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT HE FOUND

02:06.767 --> 02:07.767
FORD CREDIBLE, MADE FUN OF HER

02:07.834 --> 02:08.834
DURING A RALLY AND ARGUED THAT

02:08.900 --> 02:09.700
EVERYONE WAS FORGETTING THE REAL

02:09.767 --> 02:11.166
VICTIMS IN THIS PROCESS.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.433
>> WELL, I SAY THAT IT'S A VERY

02:12.500 --> 02:15.400
SCARY TIME FOR YOUNG MEN IN

02:15.467 --> 02:16.934
AMERICA, WHEN YOU CAN BE GUILTY

02:17.000 --> 02:18.300
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NOT BE

02:18.367 --> 02:20.000
GUILTY OF.

02:20.066 --> 02:21.133
THIS IS A VERY, VERY -- THIS IS

02:21.200 --> 02:22.834
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.633
>> John: IS IT THOUGH?

02:24.700 --> 02:26.200
IS IT?

02:26.266 --> 02:27.934
'CAUSE THIS SEEMS LIKE A WAY

02:28.000 --> 02:29.233
LESS SCARY TIME FOR YOUNG MEN IN

02:29.300 --> 02:30.633
AMERICA THAN FOR OLD MEN IN

02:30.700 --> 02:32.133
AMERICA.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.500
'CAUSE OF THE TWO PEOPLE IN THIS

02:33.567 --> 02:34.467
PICTURE, TIMMY IS CURRENTLY

02:34.533 --> 02:35.734
GETTING A LOT OF USEFUL

02:35.800 --> 02:36.834
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SEXUAL

02:36.900 --> 02:37.900
ASSAULT IS AND HOW NOT TO COMMIT

02:37.967 --> 02:40.767
IT AS HE PREPARES TO NAVIGATE

02:40.834 --> 02:42.000
THE ROCKY WATERS OF HIS PUBERTY,

02:42.066 --> 02:44.767
WHILE GRANDPA IS JUST STUCK WITH

02:44.834 --> 02:45.600
ALL THESE SEXUAL ASSAULTS HE'S

02:45.667 --> 02:46.667
ALREADY COMMITTED.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.633
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM CLENCHING

02:47.700 --> 02:48.433
THAT BASEBALL.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.300
HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.667
AND THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DO

02:50.734 --> 02:52.100
NOW BUT RUN OUT THE CLOCK.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.667
LOOK, WHAT BECAME PAINFULLY

02:53.734 --> 02:55.033
CLEAR THIS WEEK WAS THAT NO STEP

02:55.100 --> 02:56.633
IN THIS PROCESS HAD A CHANCE OF

02:56.700 --> 02:58.633
ALTERING REPUBLICANS' COURSE.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.467
NOT BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY.

03:00.533 --> 03:01.600
NOT THE WILDLY INADEQUATE FBI

03:01.667 --> 03:03.100
INVESTIGATION.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.633
NOT A LETTER SIGNED BY 2,400

03:04.667 --> 03:05.600
LAW PROFESSORS SAYING THEY

03:05.667 --> 03:07.433
OPPOSED HIS APPOINTMENT.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.066
NOT EVEN RETIRED JUSTICE STEVENS

03:09.133 --> 03:10.300
ARGUING THAT, AFTER WATCHING

03:10.367 --> 03:11.633
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, HE NO

03:11.700 --> 03:12.767
LONGER FELT THAT HE WAS FIT TO

03:12.834 --> 03:15.467
SERVE ON THE COURT.

03:15.533 --> 03:16.100
BUT PERHAPS NO ONE EMBODIED THE

03:16.166 --> 03:17.734
REPUBLICAN PARTY'S INDIFFERENCE

03:17.800 --> 03:18.967
BETTER THAN ORRIN HATCH, WHO WAS

03:19.066 --> 03:20.100
CONFRONTED BY A GROUP OF

03:20.166 --> 03:21.333
PROTESTORS ON CAPITOL HILL AND

03:21.400 --> 03:23.300
REACTED LIKE THIS:

03:23.367 --> 03:24.934
>> WHY AREN'T YOU BRAVE ENOUGH

03:24.967 --> 03:27.367
TO TALK TO US AND EXCHANGE WITH

03:27.433 --> 03:29.600
US?

03:29.633 --> 03:31.300
DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT ME.

03:31.367 --> 03:32.800
I WAVED MY HAND AT YOU.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.233
>> WHEN YOU GROW UP --

03:34.300 --> 03:36.967
>> GROW UP?

03:37.033 --> 03:37.834
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO WOMEN THAT

03:37.900 --> 03:38.734
WAY!

03:38.800 --> 03:39.600
HOW DARE YOU!

03:39.667 --> 03:40.900
HOW DARE YOU!

03:40.967 --> 03:42.533
.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
>> John: WOW.

03:44.667 --> 03:45.867
EVEN SETTING ASIDE THE

03:45.934 --> 03:47.867
SPECTACULAR CONDESCENSION OF

03:47.934 --> 03:50.066
TELLING ADULT WOMEN TO GROW UP,

03:50.133 --> 03:51.900
THAT WAVE IS A PRETTY CLEAR

03:51.967 --> 03:53.767
FUCK-YOU.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.900
I BELIEVE THAT WAVE IS WHAT THEY

03:55.967 --> 03:58.000
CALL A "UTAH MIDDLE FINGER."

03:58.066 --> 04:00.567
BUT ONE THING CHARACTERIZED THIS

04:00.633 --> 04:07.133
ENTIRE PROCESS, IT WAS AN

04:07.200 --> 04:07.934
UTTERLY SHAMELESS COMMITMENT TO

04:07.967 --> 04:09.233
BAD FAITH ARGUMENT, APPEALING TO

04:09.300 --> 04:09.800
PRINCIPLES YOU EITHER DON'T

04:09.867 --> 04:10.467
BELIEVE IN OR HAVE NO INTENTION

04:10.533 --> 04:11.333
OF UPHOLDING.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.333
LOOK AT MITCH McCONNELL.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.333
HE ACCUSED DEMOCRATS OF BEING

04:13.400 --> 04:14.700
OBSTRUCTIONIST THIS WEEK, WHICH

04:14.767 --> 04:15.934
IS A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE FROM

04:15.967 --> 04:17.233
SOMEONE WHO NOT ONLY BLOCKED

04:17.300 --> 04:18.266
MERRICK GARLAND FROM THE COURT,

04:18.333 --> 04:19.567
HE EVEN BRAGGED ABOUT IT.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.967
>> ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS IS

04:22.033 --> 04:23.033
WHEN I LOOKED AT BARACK OBAMA IN

04:23.100 --> 04:24.200
THE EYE AND SAID,

04:24.266 --> 04:25.300
"MR. PRESIDENT, YOU WILL NOT

04:25.367 --> 04:26.433
FILL THIS SUPREME COURT

04:26.500 --> 04:27.500
VACANCY."

04:27.567 --> 04:28.500
>> John: ONE OF YOUR PROUDEST

04:28.567 --> 04:29.700
MOMENTS?

04:29.767 --> 04:30.433
MITCH McCONNELL HAS THREE

04:30.500 --> 04:31.867
CHILDREN.

04:31.934 --> 04:34.767
SO THAT'S GOT TO MAKE FOR AN

04:34.834 --> 04:35.767
AWKWARD THANKSGIVING WHEN YOU

04:35.834 --> 04:37.834
HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM AND TELL

04:37.900 --> 04:39.200
THEM THAT NOTHING, NOTHING,

04:39.266 --> 04:40.967
NOTHING THEY'VE DONE COMPARES TO

04:41.066 --> 04:42.700
THAT ONE TIME YOU WERE A DICK TO

04:42.767 --> 04:45.467
THE COOL PRESIDENT.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.633
MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE

04:48.700 --> 04:49.734
CHUCK GRASSLEY RAILED AGAINST

04:49.800 --> 04:50.967
THE FALSEHOODS THAT HE SAID

04:51.033 --> 04:52.333
DEMOCRATS HAD CIRCULATED AGAINST

04:52.400 --> 04:53.934
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT WHEN

04:54.000 --> 04:56.734
PRESENTED WITH A BASELESS

04:56.800 --> 04:57.734
CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT THE

04:57.800 --> 04:59.133
PROTESTORS WHO YELLED AT

04:59.200 --> 04:59.967
JEFF FLAKE, LOOK HOW QUICKLY HE

05:00.066 --> 05:01.867
CO-SIGNED ON IT.

05:01.934 --> 05:02.800
>> DO YOU BELIEVE GEORGE SOROS

05:02.867 --> 05:03.667
IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS, PAYING

05:03.734 --> 05:04.734
THESE PEOPLE TO GET YOU AND YOUR

05:04.800 --> 05:06.200
COLLEAGUES IN ELEVATORS OR

05:06.266 --> 05:07.767
WHEREVER THEY CAN GET IN YOUR

05:07.834 --> 05:11.200
FACE?

05:11.266 --> 05:13.166
>> I HAVE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE

05:13.233 --> 05:14.734
BELIEVE THAT.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.934
I TEND TO BELIEVE IT.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.200
I BELIEVE IT FITS IN HIS ATTACK

05:17.266 --> 05:18.633
MODE THAT HE HAS AND HOW HE USES

05:18.700 --> 05:21.133
HIS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

05:21.200 --> 05:25.600
RESOURCES.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.467
>> John: BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S

05:27.533 --> 05:28.900
BULLSHIT, GRASSLEY, DON'T YOU?

05:28.967 --> 05:30.467
GEORGE SOROS ISN'T PAYING PEOPLE

05:30.533 --> 05:31.900
TO YELL AT JEFF FLAKE IN AN

05:31.967 --> 05:33.533
ELEVATOR.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.934
IT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.367
PEOPLE WILL HAPPILY DO THAT FOR

05:36.433 --> 05:37.667
FREE.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.467
IN FACT, PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO

05:39.533 --> 05:40.367
YELL AT JEFF FLAKE IN AN

05:40.433 --> 05:42.200
ELEVATOR.

05:42.266 --> 05:43.600
IF DISNEY WORLD HAD A RIDE

05:43.667 --> 05:44.734
CALLED "YELL AT JEFF FLAKE IN AN

05:44.800 --> 05:47.033
ELEVATOR", THE LINE WOULD

05:47.100 --> 05:48.433
BE LONGER THAN

05:48.500 --> 05:50.367
SPACE FUCKING MOUNTAIN.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.100
AND THEN THERE WAS

05:52.166 --> 05:53.567
SUSAN COLLINS, WHOSE "YES" VOTE

05:53.633 --> 05:54.734
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOTELY

05:54.800 --> 05:56.400
SURPRISING TO ANYONE.

05:56.467 --> 05:57.667
SHE DISAPPOINTS AT A RATE

05:57.700 --> 05:59.467
NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DINNERS

05:59.533 --> 06:01.367
COOKED BY DIVORCED DADS.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.834
"THIS ISN'T DAD'S SPECIAL

06:02.900 --> 06:05.333
SPAGHETTI, IT'S RAGU AND RICE.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.567
JUST GIVE ME A GUMMY VITAMIN AND

06:06.633 --> 06:08.433
LET'S CALL IT A DAY."

06:08.500 --> 06:09.767
COLLINS ENGAGED IN SOME

06:09.834 --> 06:11.300
SPECTACULAR BAD FAITH BULLSHIT,

06:11.367 --> 06:13.133
BECAUSE IN ANNOUNCING HER "YES"

06:13.200 --> 06:20.033
VOTE, SHE WAXED INDIGNANT ABOUT

06:20.100 --> 06:20.900
THE DARK MONEY THAT SHE FELT HAD

06:20.967 --> 06:21.867
CORRUPTED THIS PROCESS.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.667
>> WE HAVE SEEN SPECIAL INTEREST

06:23.734 --> 06:24.300
GROUPS WHIP THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO

06:24.367 --> 06:26.633
A FRENZY.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.600
INTEREST GROUPS HAVE ALSO SPENT

06:27.667 --> 06:29.233
AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF DARK

06:29.300 --> 06:33.367
MONEY OPPOSING THIS NOMINATION.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.567
>> John: NOW, HERE'S THE THING

06:34.633 --> 06:35.500
ABOUT THAT.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.800
THERE WAS A LOT OF DARK MONEY IN

06:36.867 --> 06:37.900
THIS PROCESS.

06:37.967 --> 06:39.300
AN ESTIMATED $9 MILLION WAS

06:39.367 --> 06:40.467
SPENT ON TV ADS SURROUNDING THE

06:40.533 --> 06:41.600
NOMINATION.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.834
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT,

06:42.900 --> 06:44.467
AROUND $7 MILLION, WAS SPENT IN

06:44.533 --> 06:47.867
SUPPORT OF KAVANAUGH.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.800
AND MORE THAN HALF OF THAT

06:49.867 --> 06:51.700
$7 MILLION CAME FROM JUST ONE

06:51.767 --> 06:52.734
GROUP, THE RIGHT-WING JUDICIAL

06:52.800 --> 06:53.867
CRISIS NETWORK, WHO RAN ADS LIKE

06:53.934 --> 06:55.300
THIS ONE:

06:55.367 --> 06:56.467
>> THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST

06:56.533 --> 06:57.734
BRETT KAVANAUGH ARE A SMEAR.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.934
AND THE WOMEN WHO KNOW HIM BEST

07:00.000 --> 07:00.967
DISPUTE THEM.

07:01.066 --> 07:02.600
>> THAT'S NOT THE BRETT I KNOW.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.533
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A GOOD

07:04.600 --> 07:05.500
MAN.

07:05.567 --> 07:06.333
>> HE NEVER BECAME SOMEONE

07:06.400 --> 07:07.533
DIFFERENT AFTER DRINKING.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.967
>> HE NEVER EVER WAS OUT OF

07:09.066 --> 07:10.300
CONTROL.

07:10.367 --> 07:11.567
>> HE'D BE THE GUY TO LOOK OUT

07:11.600 --> 07:13.066
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.100
>> IT NEVER HAPPENED.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.500
CONFIRM KAVANAUGH.

07:15.567 --> 07:16.400
>> John: "IT NEVER HAPPENED."

07:16.467 --> 07:19.600
WOW.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.033
AND THE REASON THAT THEY CAN BE

07:21.100 --> 07:22.667
SURE IS THEY HAVE FIVE WHOLE

07:22.734 --> 07:23.200
WOMEN SAYING THEY SUPPORT

07:23.266 --> 07:24.000
KAVANAUGH.

07:24.066 --> 07:25.000
EXCEPT NOT REALLY, 'CAUSE IT

07:25.066 --> 07:25.834
TURNS OUT THIS WOMAN AND THIS

07:25.900 --> 07:26.700
WOMAN ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME

07:26.767 --> 07:28.300
PERSON.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.433
WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE WHY STOP

07:29.500 --> 07:31.600
THERE?

07:31.667 --> 07:33.800
WHY NOT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE 50

07:33.867 --> 07:34.734
WOMEN ARE VOUCHING FOR

07:34.800 --> 07:36.133
BRETT KAVANAUGH, OR 50,000, OR

07:36.233 --> 07:37.700
JUST FOUR TINY WOMEN AND ONE

07:37.767 --> 07:38.867
GIANT ONE.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.467
LOOK HOW BIG SHE IS!

07:40.533 --> 07:41.734
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH HAD SEXUALLY

07:41.800 --> 07:42.500
ASSAULTED SOMEONE, SHE WOULD

07:42.567 --> 07:43.500
HAVE SEEN IT.

07:43.567 --> 07:44.800
SHE DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE SEEN

07:44.867 --> 07:46.800
IT.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.800
SHE SEES EVERYTHING.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.734
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WASN'T ABOUT

07:50.800 --> 07:52.066
PRINCIPLE.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.333
IT WAS JUST ABOUT GETTING WHAT

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
YOU WANT, NO MATTER HOW YOU HAVE

07:54.467 --> 07:55.934
TO DO IT OR WHAT DAMAGE IT DOES

07:55.967 --> 07:59.600
TO DR. FORD, TO OTHER SURVIVORS,

07:59.667 --> 08:00.500
OR TO OUR FUNDAMENTAL TRUST IN

08:00.567 --> 08:01.767
THE SUPREME COURT.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.033
IT WAS BORDERLINE PATHOLOGICAL.

08:03.100 --> 08:03.834
WHICH NATURALLY BRINGS US BACK

08:03.900 --> 08:05.500
TO THE PRESIDENT.

08:05.567 --> 08:06.633
AND IN MINNESOTA THIS WEEK,

08:06.700 --> 08:07.934
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHERE HIS

08:08.000 --> 08:09.867
"WIN AT ALL COSTS" PHILOSOPHY

08:09.934 --> 08:10.533
WAS LAID TERRIFYINGLY BARE,

08:10.600 --> 08:12.266
BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO MAKE FUN OF

08:12.333 --> 08:13.567
AL FRANKEN, WHO, YOU MAY

08:13.633 --> 08:14.667
REMEMBER, RESIGNED FROM THE

08:14.734 --> 08:15.867
SENATE AFTER MULTIPLE

08:15.934 --> 08:16.700
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL

08:16.767 --> 08:18.400
MISCONDUCT.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.767
BUT TRUMP MOCKED HIM NOT FOR

08:19.834 --> 08:20.800
WHAT HE'D DONE, BUT FOR BEING

08:20.867 --> 08:21.633
DUMB ENOUGH TO TAKE

08:21.700 --> 08:23.433
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.934
>> I DON'T WANT TO MENTION

08:24.967 --> 08:30.767
AL FRANKEN'S NAME.

08:30.834 --> 08:31.333
OKAY, SO I WON'T MENTION IT.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.266
HE WAS GONE.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.467
HE WAS GONE SO FAST!

08:33.533 --> 08:33.967
IT WAS LIKE, OH, HE DID

08:34.033 --> 08:34.633
SOMETHING, "OH, OH, I RESIGN.

08:34.700 --> 08:35.700
I QUIT.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.734
I QUIT."

08:37.800 --> 08:38.667
>> John: WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU

08:38.734 --> 08:42.266
MAKING FUN OF THERE?

08:42.333 --> 08:42.967
"OH, OH!

08:43.066 --> 08:43.900
I DID SOMETHING WRONG, AND I GOT

08:43.967 --> 08:44.734
CAUGHT, SO NOW I HAVE TO LEAVE!"

08:44.800 --> 08:47.700
YES.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.367
THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO.

08:50.433 --> 08:54.233
TRUMP HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH SO

08:54.300 --> 08:55.367
MUCH IN HIS LIFE FOR SO LONG

08:55.433 --> 08:55.967
THAT HE MOCKS THE VERY IDEA OF

08:56.033 --> 08:56.967
ACCOUNTABILITY.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.266
I BET IN THE TRUMP HOUSEHOLD,

08:58.333 --> 08:59.066
THE BOARD GAME "SORRY" IS JUST

08:59.133 --> 09:00.567
CALLED...

09:02.166 --> 09:04.333
PUSSY.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
AND YET, HERE'S THE THING, IT

09:06.467 --> 09:12.100
WORKED, AND THE REPUBLICANS, WON

09:12.166 --> 09:13.033
THIS WEEK IN A BIG WAY, AND IT

09:13.100 --> 09:14.367
COULD TAKE DECADES TO UNDO THE

09:14.433 --> 09:15.166
DAMAGE.

09:15.233 --> 09:16.166
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHERE

09:16.233 --> 09:17.166
TO START, NOVEMBER THE 6TH IS

09:17.233 --> 09:18.300
JUST ONE MONTH AWAY, AND YOU

09:18.367 --> 09:19.333
HAVE A CHANCE TO DELIVER THE

09:19.400 --> 09:20.734
ONLY KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT

09:20.800 --> 09:22.834
ACTUALLY MATTERS TO TRUMP AND

09:22.900 --> 09:24.667
HIS PARTY.

09:24.734 --> 09:25.934
WHILE IT IS BY NO MEANS A

09:26.000 --> 09:28.433
FOREGONE CONCLUSION, IT IS THE

09:28.500 --> 09:29.834
ONLY CHANCE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

09:29.900 --> 09:31.066
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE STRAIGHT IN

09:31.133 --> 09:32.900
THE EYE AND SAY "GOOD BYE."

09:32.967 --> 09:38.967
AND NOW THIS.

09:39.066 --> 09:40.633
>> Announcer: AND NOW, SOMEONE

09:40.700 --> 09:42.567
TELL THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S

09:42.633 --> 09:45.867
GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT

09:45.934 --> 09:46.800
TO TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

09:46.867 --> 09:47.500
>> THEY WANT TO RISE UP.

09:47.567 --> 09:48.533
AS IT DOES THAT, IT COOLS AND

09:48.600 --> 09:49.200
CONDENSES, BLOWS OVER THE CITY,

09:49.266 --> 09:50.333
AND IT JUST STARTS PUKING SNOW.

09:50.400 --> 09:50.967
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU JUST START

09:51.033 --> 09:51.767
GLIDING LIKE SKIS ON THE ROAD.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.867
YOU FIND YOURSELF SWERVING IN

09:53.934 --> 09:54.500
ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, AND A

09:54.567 --> 09:55.433
SEMI MIGHT BREAK THROUGH THE

09:55.500 --> 09:56.567
ICE.

09:56.633 --> 09:57.433
THINK ABOUT MULTIPLE CARS

09:57.500 --> 09:58.266
THOUGH.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.133
THEN WE START TO RUN INTO

09:59.200 --> 10:00.166
TROUBLE.

10:00.233 --> 10:00.967
YOU NEED THAT TO SUPPORT THE

10:01.033 --> 10:01.767
WEIGHT OF A MAN.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.066
YOU'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH

10:03.133 --> 10:08.600
THE WIND.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.166
THE TRACK AT CHURCHILL DOWNS

10:10.233 --> 10:11.066
IS A 1-MILE LOOP.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.033
>> VOILA, WE GET OURSELVES MY

10:12.100 --> 10:12.934
FAVORITE TREE, THE MAPLE TREE.

10:13.000 --> 10:13.800
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A FULL SUPER

10:13.867 --> 10:14.633
MOON AND A LUNAR ECLIPSE, WE

10:14.700 --> 10:15.667
DON'T HAVE THAT THIS YEAR.

10:15.734 --> 10:20.834
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW MOON

10:20.900 --> 10:21.467
WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE

10:21.533 --> 10:22.200
VERY DARK.

10:22.266 --> 10:22.800
>> WHEN YOU CAN SEE DEBRIS ON

10:22.867 --> 10:23.633
THE GROUND, YOU KNOW YOU GOT A

10:23.700 --> 10:24.233
TORNADO.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.500
GOLF BALL SIZE HAIL..

10:25.567 --> 10:30.066
BASEBALL SIZE HAIL.

10:30.133 --> 10:30.734
YOU CAN GET THE SOFTBALL SIZE.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.233
>> IMAGINE THAT WITH THAT

10:32.300 --> 10:33.166
CARRIES LARGE OBJECTS IN IT.

10:33.233 --> 10:33.967
>> LET ME STAND BACK HERE,

10:34.033 --> 10:36.300
BECAUSE THOSE MANHOLE COVERS,

10:36.367 --> 10:38.166
THEY CAN BLAST...

10:38.233 --> 10:39.000
>> WHOA, OH, MAN!

10:39.066 --> 10:40.367
THERE COULD BE EXTENSIVE POWER

10:40.433 --> 10:41.166
OUTAGES.

10:41.233 --> 10:46.900
OH!

10:46.967 --> 10:49.200
>> I'M GRABBING MY HELMET.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.100
I'M TAKING SHELTER NOW.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.867
♪ ♪

10:52.934 --> 10:55.100
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.233
NOW, OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

10:57.300 --> 10:58.767
CONCERNS BRAZIL, HOME OF THAT

10:58.834 --> 11:00.867
ONE FAMOUS STATUE I DON'T KNOW

11:00.934 --> 11:04.033
THE NAME OF BECAUSE I'M TOO

11:04.100 --> 11:06.567
EMBARRASSED TO GOOGLE

11:06.633 --> 11:07.533
"COME AT ME BRO JESUS STATUE."

11:07.600 --> 11:08.734
WE THINK OF BRAZIL AS BEING

11:08.800 --> 11:09.734
SYNONYMOUS WITH SOCCER, BEACHES,

11:09.800 --> 11:10.834
AND, OF COURSE, THE

11:10.900 --> 11:12.367
RIO CARNIVAL, THE EXUBERANT

11:12.433 --> 11:13.800
CELEBRATION THAT HAS INSPIRED

11:13.867 --> 11:14.967
BREATHLESS NEWSREEL REPORTS

11:15.066 --> 11:17.233
SINCE THE 1930s.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.467
>> DOWN IN RIO, THEY'RE TURNING

11:18.533 --> 11:19.700
NIGHT INTO DAY.

11:19.767 --> 11:20.900
IT'S THE FINAL DAY OF THE BIG

11:20.967 --> 11:22.233
CARNIVAL, AND A MERE COUPLE OF

11:22.300 --> 11:23.367
MILLION CARIOCAS -- BRAZILIANS

11:23.433 --> 11:24.633
TO YOU -- ARE OUT ON A GREAT

11:24.700 --> 11:26.233
WHOOPEE.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.834
>> John: "YES, THOSE FUN-SEEKING

11:27.900 --> 11:29.133
CARIOCAS ARE HAVING THEMSELVES A

11:29.200 --> 11:30.367
GREAT WHOOPEE!

11:30.433 --> 11:31.266
WHAT AN EXCITABLE GROUP OF

11:31.333 --> 11:32.400
PEOPLE THEY ARE.

11:32.467 --> 11:34.533
WHAT A FUN BUNCH."

11:34.600 --> 11:35.567
NOW, I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT,

11:35.633 --> 11:37.233
THE TONE OF BRITISH NEWSREELS IN

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
THE PAST IS BREATHTAKINGLY

11:38.767 --> 11:39.967
CONDESCENDING, ALTHOUGH BEFORE

11:40.066 --> 11:41.166
YOU GET TOO JUDGMENTAL, YOU

11:41.233 --> 11:42.200
MIGHT WANT TO SEE AN AMERICAN

11:42.266 --> 11:44.734
ONE FROM THE SAME ERA.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.333
>> BRAZIL ITSELF IS LARGER THAN

11:46.400 --> 11:47.967
THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED STATES,

11:48.033 --> 11:49.266
AND IT HAS MILLIONS OF ACRES OF

11:49.333 --> 11:50.500
LAND THAT NO WHITE MAN HAS EVER

11:50.567 --> 11:51.567
SEEN.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.433
>> John: WHOA!

11:53.500 --> 11:54.734
WHOA!

11:54.800 --> 11:55.734
THAT BASIC GEOGRAPHY LESSON JUST

11:55.800 --> 11:57.767
TOOK A PRETTY RACIST TURN.

11:57.834 --> 11:58.767
THE POINT IS, NONE OF US HAVE

11:58.834 --> 12:00.667
OUR HANDS CLEAN.

12:00.734 --> 12:02.934
ANYWAY, THE REASON I WANT TO

12:02.967 --> 12:04.867
TALK ABOUT BRAZIL TONIGHT IS

12:04.934 --> 12:06.300
THAT THEY HAD A MASSIVE ELECTION

12:06.367 --> 12:09.100
TODAY, THE FIRST OF TWO ROUNDS

12:09.166 --> 12:10.233
OF VOTING TO ELECT, AMONG OTHER

12:10.300 --> 12:11.567
THINGS, A NEW PRESIDENT.

12:11.633 --> 12:12.867
AND WHILE RESULTS ARE COMING IN

12:12.934 --> 12:14.500
AS WE SPEAK, IT IS WORTH TALKING

12:14.567 --> 12:15.066
ABOUT IT FOR A NUMBER OF

12:15.133 --> 12:15.934
REASONS.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.800
FIRST, BRAZILIAN POLITICS CAN BE

12:16.867 --> 12:18.100
A LOT OF FUN.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.100
AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE,

12:19.166 --> 12:20.734
BROADCASTERS HAVE TO PROVIDE

12:20.800 --> 12:21.433
FREE AIRTIME TO POLITICAL

12:21.500 --> 12:22.967
PARTIES, AND SOME CANDIDATES USE

12:23.033 --> 12:23.667
THAT AIRTIME TO REALLY FUCK

12:23.734 --> 12:27.100
AROUND.

12:27.166 --> 12:28.166
OVER THE YEARS, THERE'VE BEEN

12:28.233 --> 12:29.367
ADS FOR A GUY DRESSED AS A

12:29.433 --> 12:31.600
GRASSHOPPER, A DANCING CHICKEN,

12:31.667 --> 12:32.900
A SMALL, ELDERLY VERSION OF

12:32.967 --> 12:34.433
ROBIN, A SURPRISINGLY

12:34.500 --> 12:35.900
HEALTHY-LOOKING OSAMA BIN LADEN,

12:35.967 --> 12:36.900
CAPTAIN AMERICA, A HUSKY

12:36.967 --> 12:37.667
SPIDER-MAN, AND MY FAVORITE,

12:37.734 --> 12:38.533
"GERALDO WOLVERINE."

12:38.600 --> 12:50.533
>> John: NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

12:50.600 --> 12:51.333
THINKING.

12:51.400 --> 12:59.333
IF HILLARY HAD JUST DONE THAT,

12:59.400 --> 13:00.100
THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT

13:00.166 --> 13:00.767
DIFFERENT.

13:00.834 --> 13:01.533
WELL, MAYBE, BUT WE'LL NEVER

13:01.600 --> 13:02.233
KNOW.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.233
BUT THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN CRAZY

13:03.300 --> 13:03.867
FOR REASONS THAT GO WELL BEYOND

13:03.934 --> 13:04.333
NOVELTY WOLVERINES.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.533
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WHY

13:05.600 --> 13:06.033
SHOULD I CARE ABOUT IT?"

13:06.100 --> 13:06.767
WELL, FIRST, THAT'S A PRETTY

13:06.834 --> 13:07.767
HOSTILE WAY TO PUT IT.

13:07.834 --> 13:08.934
BUT SECOND, BRAZIL IS HOME TO

13:09.000 --> 13:10.533
200 MILLION PEOPLE.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.166
IT'S THE FIFTH LARGEST COUNTRY

13:12.233 --> 13:13.867
ON EARTH, AND THEY COULD BE ON

13:13.934 --> 13:16.734
THE BRINK OF MASSIVE CHANGE,

13:16.800 --> 13:17.734
BECAUSE BRAZILIANS ARE PISSED

13:17.800 --> 13:19.100
OFF RIGHT NOW.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.633
ONE RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT

13:20.667 --> 13:22.967
95% OF THEM SAY THEIR COUNTRY IS

13:23.033 --> 13:24.000
HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

13:24.066 --> 13:24.867
AND AS YOU'LL SEE TONIGHT, THERE

13:24.934 --> 13:26.133
IS A VERY REAL CHANCE THEY'RE

13:26.200 --> 13:27.233
ABOUT TO ELECT A DANGEROUS

13:27.300 --> 13:28.700
IDEOLOGUE, WITH POTENTIALLY

13:28.767 --> 13:30.300
DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.266
SO LET US LOOK AT WHY THAT'S THE

13:32.333 --> 13:33.266
CASE.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.700
AND THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO

13:34.767 --> 13:36.500
UNDERSTAND IS THAT BRAZIL IS

13:36.567 --> 13:37.633
JUST EMERGING FROM THE WORST

13:37.700 --> 13:39.133
RECESSION IN ITS HISTORY.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.533
MILLIONS ARE OUT OF WORK, AND IN

13:40.600 --> 13:41.533
SOME REGIONS, CRIME IS OUT OF

13:41.600 --> 13:42.967
CONTROL.

13:43.033 --> 13:44.367
LAST YEAR, THERE WERE MORE THAN

13:44.433 --> 13:45.467
63,000 HOMICIDES IN BRAZIL.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.333
THAT'S MORE THAN EUROPE AND THE

13:46.400 --> 13:48.667
UNITED STATES COMBINED.

13:48.734 --> 13:50.066
AND IF YOU LIVE IN RIO, YOU'RE

13:50.133 --> 13:52.100
PROBABLY ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.767
>> 30% OF THE CITIZENS THAT LIVE

13:53.834 --> 13:55.333
IN RIO WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A

13:55.400 --> 14:00.600
CROSSFIRE ONCE IN THE LAST YEAR.

14:00.667 --> 14:01.967
>> John: 30% WERE IN THE MIDDLE

14:02.033 --> 14:04.767
OF CROSSFIRE.

14:04.834 --> 14:05.800
AT THAT POINT, RIO'S

14:05.867 --> 14:07.033
WEATHER CHANNEL SHOULD PROBABLY

14:07.100 --> 14:08.734
INCLUDE CROSSFIRE IN THEIR

14:08.800 --> 14:09.934
FORECASTS.

14:09.967 --> 14:10.900
"TODAY'S LOOKING PARTLY CLOUDY,

14:10.967 --> 14:12.066
WITH A 30% CHANCE OF A HAILSTORM

14:12.133 --> 14:14.100
OF BULLETS.

14:14.166 --> 14:14.967
SO MAYBE BRING A LIGHT FLAK

14:15.033 --> 14:16.934
JACKET WITH YOU."

14:17.000 --> 14:18.100
AND THE GENERAL DISSATISFACTION

14:18.166 --> 14:20.633
ABOUT CRIME HAS BEEN EXACERBATED

14:20.700 --> 14:22.300
BY A GIGANTIC CORRUPTION SCANDAL

14:22.367 --> 14:23.333
ARISING FROM AN INVESTIGATION

14:23.400 --> 14:24.500
KNOWN AS "OPERATION CAR WASH."

14:24.600 --> 14:25.800
AND I REALIZE THAT THAT DOESN'T

14:25.867 --> 14:27.133
SOUND LIKE THE NAME OF A MAJOR

14:27.200 --> 14:28.500
INVESTIGATION.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.700
IT SOUNDS LIKE A NETFLIX

14:29.767 --> 14:31.200
ORIGINAL COMEDY STARRING

14:31.266 --> 14:32.600
KEVIN JAMES THAT, FOR SOME

14:32.667 --> 14:37.734
REASON, YOU'LL BE RECOMMENDED

14:37.800 --> 14:39.066
BECAUSE YOU WATCHED ONE EPISODE

14:39.133 --> 14:40.066
OF "CHEF'S TABLE."

14:40.133 --> 14:40.934
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR ALGORITHM

14:41.000 --> 14:42.066
IS, NETFLIX, BUT I FUCKING HATE

14:42.133 --> 14:43.400
IT.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.967
NOW, "OPERATION CAR WASH" AND

14:45.033 --> 14:46.233
THE SCANDAL UNCOVERED BY IT IS

14:46.300 --> 14:47.400
WAY TOO COMPLICATED TO GET INTO

14:47.467 --> 14:49.834
NOW.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.333
SUFFICE TO SAY THAT IT

14:52.400 --> 14:53.266
INVOLVES THIS GAS STATION,

14:53.333 --> 14:54.834
THESE TWO COMPANIES, INFLATED

14:54.900 --> 14:55.867
CONTRACTS, BRIBES AND KICKBACKS

14:55.934 --> 14:57.066
TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND AN

14:57.133 --> 14:58.667
AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO FLEW

14:58.734 --> 14:59.867
AROUND THE WORLD WITH BRICKS OF

14:59.934 --> 15:01.834
CASH SHRINK-WRAPPED AND STRAPPED

15:01.900 --> 15:03.567
BENEATH THIGH-HIGH SOCKS AND A

15:03.633 --> 15:05.333
SPANX-LIKE VEST, WHICH REALLY

15:05.400 --> 15:06.767
EXPLAINS THIS YEAR'S HOTTEST

15:06.834 --> 15:07.500
HALLOWEEN COSTUME, SEXY CAR WASH

15:07.567 --> 15:13.767
CO-CONSPIRATOR.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.166
AND, LOOK, THE SHEER SCALE OF

15:15.233 --> 15:16.233
THIS SCANDAL IS MIND-BLOWING, AS

15:16.300 --> 15:16.967
THE LEAD PROSECUTOR WILL TELL

15:17.066 --> 15:18.066
YOU.

15:18.133 --> 15:18.700
>> HOW DOES CAR WASH COMPARE TO

15:18.767 --> 15:19.667
WATERGATE?

15:19.734 --> 15:20.900
>> CAR WASH IS MUCH, MUCH

15:20.967 --> 15:21.200
BIGGER.

15:21.266 --> 15:21.900
>> BIGGER THAN WATERGATE?

15:21.967 --> 15:22.867
>> MUCH BIGGER.

15:22.934 --> 15:24.200
WE ALREADY HAVE CHARGED MORE

15:24.266 --> 15:25.400
THAN 200 PEOPLE FOR HUNDREDS OF

15:25.467 --> 15:27.900
CRIMES.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.800
THE AMOUNT OF BRIBES PAID GO UP

15:29.867 --> 15:33.567
TO ABOUT $2 BILLION.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.767
>> John: $2 BILLION AND BIGGER

15:34.834 --> 15:38.133
THAN WATERGATE.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.767
RICHARD NIXON MUST BE SPINNING

15:39.834 --> 15:40.400
IN HIS GRAVE RIGHT NOW.

15:40.467 --> 15:41.600
WAIT A SECOND.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.867
PULL OUT A BIT.

15:42.934 --> 15:46.633
NO, HE'S ESCAPED AGAIN!

15:46.700 --> 15:47.967
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!

15:48.033 --> 15:49.033
GOD DAMN IT, TRICKY DICK, YOU'RE

15:49.100 --> 15:51.800
SO TRICKY!

15:51.867 --> 15:53.066
YOU'RE SO TRICKY!

15:53.133 --> 15:54.467
OPERATION CAR WASH HAS ROCKED

15:54.533 --> 15:55.400
BRAZILIANS' FAITH IN THEIR

15:55.467 --> 15:56.467
GOVERNMENT TO ITS VERY CORE, AND

15:56.533 --> 15:57.700
THE PEOPLE THERE ARE

15:57.767 --> 16:00.533
UNDERSTANDABLY DISILLUSIONED.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.066
>> I THINK BRAZIL IS HEADING

16:02.133 --> 16:02.967
TOWARDS COMPLETE CHAOS.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.500
THAT IS MY IMPRESSION.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.834
POLITICIANS ARE NOT GOVERNING.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.800
IT'S A COMPLETE MESS.

16:07.867 --> 16:08.967
>> I'M GOING TO CAST A BLANK

16:09.066 --> 16:10.600
BALLOT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO

16:10.667 --> 16:12.100
TO VOTE FOR ANYMORE.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.266
>> WE PUT OURSELVES IN THIS

16:13.333 --> 16:14.367
SITUATION.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.600
THE COUNTRY OF THE FUTURE IS THE

16:15.667 --> 16:16.867
COUNTRY OF MISERY.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.867
>> John: "THE COUNTRY OF

16:17.934 --> 16:19.333
MISERY."

16:19.400 --> 16:20.600
THAT'S JUST NOT A PHRASE YOU

16:20.667 --> 16:22.066
EXPECT TO COME OUT OF BRAZIL.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.200
IT'S A PHRASE YOU EXPECT TO BE

16:23.266 --> 16:24.367
THE OFFICIAL TOURISM SLOGAN OF

16:24.433 --> 16:26.200
GREAT BRITAIN.

16:26.266 --> 16:27.266
"COME TO BRITAIN: WE PROMISE

16:27.333 --> 16:30.233
THERE WILL BE NO GREAT WHOOPEE."

16:30.300 --> 16:32.033
SO WHOSE JOB WILL IT BE TO TRY

16:32.100 --> 16:37.133
AND TURN THINGS AROUND?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.066
WELL, THE MOST POPULAR

16:38.133 --> 16:40.100
POLITICIAN IN BRAZIL, BY FAR, IS

16:40.166 --> 16:41.400
THIS GUY, FORMER PRESIDENT

16:41.467 --> 16:42.066
LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.133
HE'S BELOVED FOR PRESIDING OVER

16:43.200 --> 16:44.500
A PERIOD OF PROSPERITY THERE IN

16:44.567 --> 16:46.667
WHICH SOCIAL PROGRAMS WERE

16:46.734 --> 16:48.567
EXPANDED AND MILLIONS WERE

16:48.633 --> 16:50.033
LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.100
HE WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING TO

16:51.166 --> 16:52.266
RE-TAKE HIS OFFICE AND WAS

16:52.333 --> 16:52.767
PROJECTED TO WIN EASILY.

16:52.834 --> 16:57.033
THERE WAS JUST ONE MINOR ISSUE.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.500
>> ONE OF BRAZIL'S MOST

16:58.567 --> 17:00.367
INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL FIGURES IS

17:00.433 --> 17:01.633
NOW IN POLICE CUSTODY.

17:01.700 --> 17:02.467
FORMER BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT

17:02.533 --> 17:03.633
LUIS LULA DA SILVA TURNED

17:03.700 --> 17:05.133
HIMSELF IN ON SATURDAY TO SERVE

17:05.200 --> 17:06.867
A 12-YEAR SENTENCE FOR

17:06.934 --> 17:07.734
CORRUPTION.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.200
>> John: YEP.

17:11.266 --> 17:12.700
LULA WAS CAUGHT UP IN

17:12.767 --> 17:13.867
OPERATION CAR WASH TOO.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.400
AND HE CLAIMS THAT THE CHARGES

17:15.467 --> 17:16.233
AGAINST HIM WERE POLITICALLY

17:16.300 --> 17:16.834
MOTIVATED, AND MANY SUPPORTERS

17:16.900 --> 17:17.133
BELIEVE HIM.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.033
IN FACT, HE'S STILL SO POPULAR

17:18.100 --> 17:18.800
THAT POLLS SHOWED HE WOULD'VE

17:18.867 --> 17:19.734
WON THE ELECTION IF HE'D BEEN

17:19.800 --> 17:21.233
ALLOWED TO RUN FROM PRISON.

17:21.300 --> 17:21.967
WHICH KIND OF MAKES SENSE,

17:22.033 --> 17:22.967
BECAUSE ELECTING A PRESIDENT WHO

17:23.033 --> 17:24.200
IS ALREADY IN PRISON FOR

17:24.266 --> 17:24.967
CORRUPTION DOES SAVE YOU THE

17:25.066 --> 17:26.300
SEEMINGLY INEVITABLE HASSLE OF

17:26.367 --> 17:27.567
HAVING TO PUT YOUR PRESIDENT IN

17:27.633 --> 17:32.700
PRISON FOR CORRUPTION.

17:32.767 --> 17:33.600
IT'S A TIMESAVER IF NOTHING

17:33.667 --> 17:34.467
ELSE.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.500
SINCE LULA IS OUT, HIS PARTY IS

17:35.567 --> 17:36.600
RUNNING FERNANDO HADDAD IN HIS

17:36.667 --> 17:39.166
PLACE.

17:39.233 --> 17:40.800
HE'S THE FORMER MAYOR OF

17:40.867 --> 17:42.166
SAO PAULO AND IS GENERALLY

17:42.233 --> 17:43.066
LITTLE-KNOWN IN THE REST OF

17:43.133 --> 17:44.333
BRAZIL, AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

17:44.400 --> 17:48.533
BUILD UP A BRAND OF HIS OWN,

17:48.600 --> 17:49.867
HADDAD IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO

17:49.934 --> 17:50.967
PLAY UP HIS SIMILARITY TO LULA

17:51.066 --> 17:53.300
IN A SERIES OF CAMPAIGN ADS.

17:53.367 --> 17:54.400
IT'S SUBTLE, BUT JUST SEE IF YOU

17:54.467 --> 17:55.166
CAN CATCH IT.

17:55.233 --> 17:55.767
>> LULA IS HADDAD.

17:55.834 --> 17:56.734
HADDAD IS LULA.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.133
>> LULA IS HADDAD.

17:57.200 --> 17:57.633
>> HADDAD, LULA;

17:57.700 --> 17:58.233
LULA, HADDAD.

17:58.300 --> 17:58.967
>> LULA IS HADDAD.

17:59.033 --> 17:59.800
LULA IS HADDAD.

17:59.867 --> 18:00.567
>> LULA, HADDAD, LULA, HADDAD!

18:00.633 --> 18:01.333
>> LULA, HADDAD, LULA, HADDAD!

18:01.400 --> 18:02.200
>> LULA, HADDAD!

18:02.266 --> 18:02.834
LULA, HADDAD!

18:02.900 --> 18:03.533
LULA, HADDAD!

18:03.600 --> 18:04.400
>> I'M LULA, I'M HADDAD.

18:04.467 --> 18:05.467
>> I'M LULA, I'M HADDAD.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.867
>> John: OH, COME ON.

18:08.934 --> 18:09.667
THAT IS JUST AN INSULT TO

18:09.734 --> 18:10.433
PEOPLE'S INTELLIGENCE.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.233
YOU CAN'T JUST SPIN A SIGN AND

18:11.300 --> 18:11.967
MAKE PEOPLE FORGET WHICH GUY IS

18:12.066 --> 18:12.734
WHICH.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.767
I CAN'T MAKE YOU MIX UP

18:13.834 --> 18:15.300
GARY BUSEY AND LUCILLE BALL BY

18:15.367 --> 18:19.533
SPINNING A SIGN AND GOING

18:19.600 --> 18:21.000
"BUSEY LUCY, BUSEY LUCY, BUSEY

18:21.066 --> 18:24.967
LUCY, BUSEY LUCY, BUSEY LUCY."

18:25.033 --> 18:26.734
WHY?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.600
BECAUSE YOU'LL STILL KNOW WHICH

18:28.667 --> 18:29.900
ONE IS AMERICA'S SWEETHEART AND

18:29.967 --> 18:32.633
WHICH WAS MARRIED TO DESI ARNAZ.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.400
NOW, THE FACT IS, HADDAD HAS HIS

18:34.467 --> 18:36.233
WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM, 'CAUSE NOT

18:36.300 --> 18:38.033
ONLY IS HE NOT LULA, THEIR

18:38.100 --> 18:39.266
PARTY, THE WORKERS' PARTY, OR

18:39.333 --> 18:40.600
PT, HAS BEEN HEAVILY TAINTED BY

18:40.667 --> 18:41.834
RECENT SCANDALS, AND MANY

18:41.867 --> 18:42.367
BRAZILIANS ARE EAGER FOR A

18:42.400 --> 18:46.433
RADICAL CHANGE.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.367
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE MAN

18:47.433 --> 18:48.333
CURRENTLY LEADING IN THE POLLS,

18:48.400 --> 18:52.567
JAIR BOLSONARO.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.000
AND THE NICEST THING THAT YOU

18:54.066 --> 18:55.433
CAN SAY FOR HIM IS, HE HAS NOT

18:55.500 --> 18:56.300
BEEN IMPLICATED IN A CORRUPTION

18:56.367 --> 18:57.100
INVESTIGATION YET.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.300
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS LITERALLY

18:58.367 --> 18:59.233
THE ONLY NICE THING THAT I CAN

18:59.300 --> 19:02.934
POSSIBLY FIND TO SAY ABOUT HIM,

19:02.967 --> 19:03.533
'CAUSE HE IS A TERRIBLE HUMAN

19:03.600 --> 19:04.300
BEING.

19:04.367 --> 19:05.367
FOR A START, HE'S A BIG FAN OF

19:05.433 --> 19:07.500
DOING FINGER GUNS.

19:07.567 --> 19:08.734
SERIOUSLY, HE DOES THIS ALL THE

19:08.800 --> 19:13.767
FUCKING TIME.

19:13.834 --> 19:14.667
THERE IS EVEN VIDEO OF HIM

19:14.734 --> 19:17.667
TEACHING A LITTLE GIRL HOW TO DO

19:17.734 --> 19:20.333
THEM FOR SOME REASON.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.900
AND, LOOK, LIKING FINGER GUNS,

19:22.967 --> 19:24.500
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

19:24.567 --> 19:25.166
IS AN IMMEDIATE CHARACTER FLAW.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.133
IT PUTS HIM IN THE AUGUST

19:26.200 --> 19:27.033
COMPANY OF MICHAEL SCOTT,

19:27.100 --> 19:27.834
CHILDREN PRETENDING TO BE

19:27.900 --> 19:28.800
COWBOYS, AND THAT COWORKER WHO

19:28.867 --> 19:29.967
SAYS THINGS LIKE "WORKIN' HARD

19:30.066 --> 19:31.133
OR HARDLY WORKIN'" THAT

19:31.200 --> 19:32.133
EVERYBODY HATES.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.533
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY GETS

19:33.600 --> 19:35.800
WORSE FROM THERE.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.633
>> A MEMBER OF THE BRAZILIAN

19:37.700 --> 19:38.767
CONGRESS SINCE 1991 AND KNOWN

19:38.834 --> 19:39.934
FOR HIS SOMETIMES RACIST,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.500
MISOGYNISTIC, HOMOPHOBIC, AND

19:41.567 --> 19:44.066
EVEN UNDEMOCRATIC VIEWS,

19:44.133 --> 19:45.734
BOLSONARO HAS CAST HIMSELF AS A

19:45.800 --> 19:48.967
POLITICAL OUTSIDER.

19:49.066 --> 19:50.567
OFFENSIVE FOR MOST, IT IS HIS

19:50.633 --> 19:51.734
OUTSPOKEN NATURE THAT HAS MANY

19:51.800 --> 19:53.200
SAYING HE'S BRAZIL'S VERSION OF

19:53.266 --> 19:55.734
DONALD TRUMP.

19:55.767 --> 19:57.633
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.066
HE'S BECOME KNOWN THERE AS

19:59.133 --> 20:00.467
"THE BRAZILIAN TRUMP," WHICH IS

20:00.533 --> 20:01.700
BOTH POLITICALLY WORRISOME, AND

20:01.767 --> 20:02.834
ALSO THE GROSSEST STYLE TO ORDER

20:02.900 --> 20:04.834
AT A PUBIC HAIR SALON.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.800
"I'LL TAKE THE BRAZILIAN TRUMP,

20:05.867 --> 20:08.333
PLEASE.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.867
IT'S WHERE YOU RIP EVERYTHING

20:09.934 --> 20:11.367
OFF THE FRONT AREA BUT YOU COMB

20:11.433 --> 20:12.166
SOME ASS HAIR AROUND TO GIVE THE

20:12.233 --> 20:13.333
ILLUSION OF HAIR."

20:13.400 --> 20:17.633
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

20:17.700 --> 20:24.300
I'M NOT SHOWING YOU IT.

20:24.367 --> 20:26.667
YOU'RE IMAGINING IT.

20:26.734 --> 20:29.066
THAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.767
DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.066
BE ANGRY WITH YOURSELF.

20:32.133 --> 20:32.834
UNFORTUNATELY, BOLSONARO HAS

20:32.900 --> 20:33.767
FIRED UP MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN

20:33.834 --> 20:34.667
BRAZIL, PARTICULARLY FROM THE

20:34.734 --> 20:35.433
MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.200
THERE'S INCREDIBLE VIDEOS ONLINE

20:36.266 --> 20:37.467
OF BOLSONARO TURNING UP TO

20:37.533 --> 20:38.233
AIRPORTS ONLY TO BE MOBBED BY A

20:38.300 --> 20:38.967
CROWD LIFTING HIM ONTO THEIR

20:39.066 --> 20:40.033
SHOULDERS AND CHANTING FOR HIM.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.033
IT IS SOME INTENSE SUPPORT.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.433
AND IT'S WORRYING THAT YOUNG

20:42.500 --> 20:44.967
PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED BY HIM,

20:45.033 --> 20:46.033
BECAUSE HE IS A HARD-RIGHT

20:46.066 --> 20:47.133
CONSERVATIVE.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.166
HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW BRAZIL FROM

20:48.233 --> 20:49.033
THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE

20:49.100 --> 20:51.967
CHANGE AND WEAKEN ENVIRONMENTAL

20:52.033 --> 20:55.200
REGULATIONS.

20:55.266 --> 20:56.400
HE'S CALLED REFUGEES ARRIVING IN

20:56.467 --> 20:57.033
BRAZIL THE SCUM OF THE WORLD.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.033
AS FOR CRIME, HE WANTS TO MAKE

20:58.100 --> 20:58.667
IT EASIER FOR BRAZILIANS TO BUY

20:58.734 --> 20:59.233
GUNS, PRESUMABLY SO THEY CAN

20:59.300 --> 21:00.033
FIGHT IT THEMSELVES.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.500
BUT HE ALSO FAVORS SOME

21:01.567 --> 21:02.133
PSYCHOTICALLY STRONG LAW

21:02.200 --> 21:03.233
ENFORCEMENT, SAYING,

21:03.300 --> 21:04.200
"A POLICEMAN WHO DOESN'T KILL

21:04.266 --> 21:06.367
ISN'T A POLICEMAN."

21:06.433 --> 21:09.467
WHICH, INCREDIBLY, ISN'T EVEN IN

21:09.533 --> 21:11.467
THE TOP TEN MOST ALARMING

21:11.533 --> 21:15.500
STATEMENTS THAT HE'S MADE.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.867
AND SOME WORRY HE WOULD ACTUALLY

21:16.934 --> 21:17.600
GO MUCH FURTHER.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.400
BOLSONARO HAS SAID IN THE PAST,

21:18.467 --> 21:19.100
"I AM IN FAVOR OF A

21:19.166 --> 21:19.867
DICTATORSHIP."

21:19.934 --> 21:20.633
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY WORRYING,

21:20.700 --> 21:21.467
AS HE'S A FORMER MILITARY

21:21.533 --> 21:22.700
CAPTAIN IN A COUNTRY THAT, UNTIL

21:22.767 --> 21:24.066
1985, WAS RULED BY A BRUTAL

21:24.133 --> 21:25.934
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.166
AND WHILE THAT REGIME ENGAGED IN

21:27.233 --> 21:28.767
TORTURE AND EXTRAJUDICIAL

21:28.834 --> 21:30.633
KILLINGS, BOLSONARO HAS SAID

21:30.700 --> 21:34.467
THAT THEIR MISTAKE WAS THAT THEY

21:34.533 --> 21:35.567
SIMPLY DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.200
>> I AM IN FAVOR OF TORTURE, YOU

21:37.266 --> 21:37.934
KNOW THAT.

21:38.033 --> 21:40.033
AND THE PEOPLE ARE TOO.

21:40.100 --> 21:40.934
THROUGH THE VOTE YOU WON'T

21:41.000 --> 21:42.200
CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY.

21:42.266 --> 21:44.233
NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.233
IT'S ONLY GOING TO CHANGE,

21:45.300 --> 21:48.533
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN WE GET TO A

21:48.600 --> 21:49.767
CIVIL WAR DOING THE JOB THAT

21:49.834 --> 21:50.367
THE MILITARY REGIME DIDN'T DO:

21:50.433 --> 21:52.767
KILLING 30,000."

21:52.834 --> 21:54.133
>> John: WOW.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.100
IT IS PRETTY JARRING TO HEAR

21:56.166 --> 21:56.867
SOMEONE CLAIM THAT A MILITARY

21:56.934 --> 21:58.266
DICTATORSHIP DIDN'T KILL ENOUGH

21:58.333 --> 22:00.033
PEOPLE.

22:00.100 --> 22:00.900
IT'S LIKE SAYING HUGH HEFNER

22:00.967 --> 22:01.800
DIDN'T FUCK ENOUGH IN THE LAST

22:01.867 --> 22:03.333
DAYS OF HIS LIFE.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.100
REALLY?

22:04.166 --> 22:05.533
REALLY?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.900
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THE

22:06.967 --> 22:07.834
AMOUNT HE DID, IT WAS ALREADY A

22:07.900 --> 22:09.500
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE.

22:09.567 --> 22:10.834
AND REGARDING BOLSONARO'S FAMOUS

22:10.900 --> 22:12.200
HOMOPHOBIA AND MISOGYNY, IT

22:12.266 --> 22:13.300
REALLY HAS TO BE SEEN TO BE

22:13.367 --> 22:15.600
BELIEVED.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.834
FIRST, TAKE A LOOK AT HOW HE

22:16.900 --> 22:17.567
ONCE SPOKE TO A FEMALE MEMBER OF

22:17.633 --> 22:19.233
CONGRESS.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.266
>> I WOULD NEVER RAPE YOU

22:20.333 --> 22:21.500
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT.

22:21.567 --> 22:22.500
>> I HOPE NOT BECAUSE I'D SLAP

22:22.567 --> 22:24.333
YOU IN THE FACE.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.166
>> DO IT, I'LL SLAP YOU BACK.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.166
DO IT, I'LL SLAP YOU BACK.

22:26.233 --> 22:27.367
DO IT, I'LL SLAP YOU BACK.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.500
>> WHAT'S THIS?

22:28.567 --> 22:29.367
ARE YOU PUSHING ME?

22:29.433 --> 22:31.367
>> DO IT, I'LL SLAP YOU BACK.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.166
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

22:33.233 --> 22:34.500
HE STARTS -- HE STARTS THERE

22:34.567 --> 22:35.533
WITH "I'D NEVER RAPE YOU,

22:35.600 --> 22:36.800
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT",

22:36.867 --> 22:38.367
AND THEN SOMEHOW MANAGES TO TOP

22:38.433 --> 22:39.967
THAT TERRIBLE STATEMENT.

22:40.033 --> 22:40.767
THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "SORRY,

22:40.834 --> 22:42.533
KIDS, CHRISTMAS IS CANCELED THIS

22:42.600 --> 22:43.300
YEAR.

22:43.367 --> 22:46.400
WHY?

22:46.467 --> 22:47.300
BECAUSE I MURDERED

22:47.367 --> 22:52.600
SANTA CLAUS."

22:52.667 --> 22:53.900
AND BOLSONARO'S HOMOPHOBIA, IF

22:53.967 --> 22:56.767
ANYTHING, IS EVEN WORSE.

22:56.834 --> 22:57.734
BECAUSE IN INTERVIEW AFTER

22:57.800 --> 22:58.567
INTERVIEW, HE'S SAID HORRIFYING

22:58.633 --> 22:59.400
THINGS.

22:59.467 --> 23:00.233
>> THEY WANT TO REACH OUR

23:00.300 --> 23:01.200
CHILDREN IN ORDER TO TURN THE

23:01.266 --> 23:02.433
CHILDREN INTO GAY ADULTS TO

23:02.500 --> 23:03.200
SATISFY THEIR SEXUALITY IN THE

23:03.266 --> 23:04.200
FUTURE.

23:04.266 --> 23:05.133
IF YOUR CHILD STARTS TO BECOME

23:05.200 --> 23:06.133
LIKE THAT, A LITTLE GAY, YOU

23:06.200 --> 23:07.567
TAKE A WHIP AND YOU CHANGE THEIR

23:07.633 --> 23:08.967
BEHAVIOR.

23:09.066 --> 23:10.533
PEOPLE SAY IT'S DISCRIMINATION,

23:10.600 --> 23:11.967
BUT YOU WHO'S WATCHING FROM

23:12.066 --> 23:12.934
HOME, WOULD YOU HIRE A

23:12.967 --> 23:14.033
GAY DRIVER TO TAKE YOUR CHILDREN

23:14.100 --> 23:16.700
TO SCHOOL?

23:16.767 --> 23:17.567
OF COURSE NOT.

23:17.633 --> 23:18.533
>> John: THAT'S JUST APPALLING,

23:18.600 --> 23:20.333
AND IT'S FRANKLY TAKING ALL THE

23:20.400 --> 23:21.700
RESTRAINT THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW

23:21.767 --> 23:22.500
NOT TO RELEASE A CHARMINGLY

23:22.567 --> 23:23.500
ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOK

23:23.567 --> 23:24.400
CALLED "MARLON BUNDO PUNCHES

23:24.467 --> 23:25.600
THAT GUY RIGHT SQUARE IN THE

23:25.667 --> 23:28.600
FACE."

23:28.667 --> 23:31.033
AND IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH,

23:31.100 --> 23:34.400
WHICH IT ALREADY VERY

23:34.467 --> 23:35.667
COMFORTABLY IS, WATCH WHAT

23:35.734 --> 23:36.567
HAPPENED WHEN ELLEN PAGE WENT TO

23:36.633 --> 23:37.600
CHALLENGE BOLSONARO ON SOME OF

23:37.667 --> 23:38.834
HIS VIEWS.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.367
>> I'M GAY, SO DO YOU THINK THAT

23:40.433 --> 23:41.667
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEATEN AS A

23:41.734 --> 23:44.200
CHILD TO NOT BE GAY NOW?

23:44.266 --> 23:46.000
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOU

23:46.066 --> 23:47.467
AND SAY, "I THINK YOU'RE GAY."

23:47.533 --> 23:49.033
THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.533
YOU'RE VERY NICE.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.767
IF I WERE A CADET IN THE

23:51.834 --> 23:52.934
MILITARY ACADEMY AND SAW YOU ON

23:52.967 --> 23:53.967
THE STREET, I WOULD WHISTLE AT

23:54.066 --> 23:55.934
YOU.

23:55.967 --> 23:56.767
ALL RIGHT?

23:56.834 --> 23:58.734
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.967
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:01.066 --> 24:02.300
HE JUST TOLD HER "I WOULDN'T

24:02.367 --> 24:05.000
BEAT YOU, I WOULD CATCALL YOU,"

24:05.066 --> 24:06.400
AND SEEMED TO GENUINELY THINK

24:06.467 --> 24:07.233
THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.967
AND LOOK HOW CONFUSED THAT MADE

24:09.033 --> 24:09.900
ELLEN PAGE.

24:09.967 --> 24:11.100
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO

24:11.166 --> 24:13.066
CONFUSE ELLEN PAGE?

24:13.133 --> 24:14.300
SHE WAS IN "INCEPTION"!

24:14.367 --> 24:15.867
THAT SHOULD BE SIMPLY

24:15.934 --> 24:19.133
IMPOSSIBLE!

24:19.200 --> 24:21.033
AND, LOOK, AS IF BOLSONARO'S

24:21.100 --> 24:22.033
CAMPAIGN WAS NOT ALREADY

24:22.100 --> 24:23.066
DRAMATIC ENOUGH, YOU MAY'VE

24:23.133 --> 24:24.133
HEARD HE WAS ACTUALLY STABBED A

24:24.200 --> 24:25.166
FEW WEEKS AGO DURING A CAMPAIGN

24:25.233 --> 24:26.533
RALLY, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

24:26.600 --> 24:30.133
HORRIFIC.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.867
ALTHOUGH HE SAYS THAT HE'S

24:31.934 --> 24:32.900
MAKING A FULL RECOVERY.

24:32.967 --> 24:33.800
AND YOU CAN TELL HE'S FEELING

24:33.867 --> 24:34.700
BETTER, BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS IN

24:34.767 --> 24:35.567
HOSPITAL, HE PULLED OUT --

24:35.633 --> 24:37.233
WHAT ELSE?

24:37.300 --> 24:38.667
THE FUCKING FINGER GUNS.

24:38.734 --> 24:40.467
NOW, BOLSONARO'S SUPPORT HAS

24:40.533 --> 24:41.033
ACTUALLY INCREASED SINCE THE

24:41.100 --> 24:41.834
ATTACK.

24:41.900 --> 24:42.467
EVEN GERALDO WOLVERINE ENDORSED

24:42.533 --> 24:45.800
HIM IN THIS BIZARRE VIDEO.

24:45.867 --> 24:47.266
>> HAH!

24:47.333 --> 24:48.867
HAH!

24:48.934 --> 24:50.367
HAH!

24:50.433 --> 24:51.967
HAH!

24:52.066 --> 24:53.633
HAH!

24:53.700 --> 24:55.400
HAH!

24:55.467 --> 24:57.867
HAH!

24:57.934 --> 25:01.266
HAH!

25:01.333 --> 25:02.667
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH!

25:02.734 --> 25:04.433
>> John: HAH!

25:04.500 --> 25:05.967
I HATE WHAT HE'S DOING.

25:06.033 --> 25:07.100
I LOVE THE WAY HE'S DOING IT.

25:07.166 --> 25:12.300
WHY IS WOLVERINE ENDORSING

25:12.367 --> 25:13.033
BOLSONARO?

25:13.100 --> 25:13.800
I DON'T KNOW.

25:13.867 --> 25:14.600
WHY DOES HE SEEM TO BE DRIVING A

25:14.667 --> 25:16.233
FORD FOCUS?

25:16.300 --> 25:16.934
THERE'S LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT

25:17.033 --> 25:17.734
THAT VIDEO RAISES, AND I JUST

25:17.800 --> 25:18.500
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF

25:18.567 --> 25:20.767
THEM.

25:20.834 --> 25:21.967
BUT, LOOK, THERE MAY BE SOME

25:22.033 --> 25:22.900
SMALL REASON FOR HOPE.

25:22.967 --> 25:24.033
A HUGE MOVEMENT HAS EMERGED IN

25:24.100 --> 25:25.233
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS CALLED

25:25.300 --> 25:26.700
"ELE NAO," OR NOT HIM.

25:26.767 --> 25:27.867
THERE'VE BEEN MASSIVE MARCHES

25:27.934 --> 25:28.867
AGAINST BOLSONARO ALL OVER

25:28.934 --> 25:30.133
BRAZIL.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.467
AND AS YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

25:31.533 --> 25:33.033
VOTING FOR "NOT HIM" IS A TRULY

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
EXCELLENT IDEA.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.033
NOW, TODAY'S ELECTION WAS

25:36.100 --> 25:37.600
SUPPOSED TO JUST DETERMINE WHO

25:37.667 --> 25:39.300
WENT INTO A TWO-PERSON RUNOFF ON

25:39.367 --> 25:40.433
OCTOBER 28TH, BUT IF ANY

25:40.500 --> 25:42.400
CANDIDATE GOT 50% OR ABOVE,

25:42.467 --> 25:45.367
THERE WOULD BE NO SECOND ROUND.

25:45.433 --> 25:46.667
THEY WOULD JUST BE BRAZIL'S

25:46.734 --> 25:49.133
PRESIDENT.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.567
AND AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE VOTE

25:50.633 --> 25:53.066
TALLY SHOWS BOLSONARO AT AROUND

25:53.133 --> 25:54.767
48% PERCENT WITH OVER 3/4 OF THE

25:54.834 --> 25:56.400
VOTES COUNTED.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.633
SO WHILE HE WILL PROBABLY GO TO

25:58.700 --> 26:00.066
A RUNOFF WITH HADDAD, THERE IS

26:00.133 --> 26:01.133
STILL A CHANCE HE'S GOING TO WIN

26:01.200 --> 26:02.467
OUTRIGHT TONIGHT.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.834
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHY

26:03.900 --> 26:05.533
WOULDN'T THAT HAPPEN?

26:05.600 --> 26:06.633
BETWEEN TAPING THIS SHOW AND

26:06.700 --> 26:08.166
AIRTIME, BOLSONARO COULD HAVE

26:08.233 --> 26:09.667
WON, RUTH BADER GINSBURG COULD

26:09.734 --> 26:11.433
HAVE BEEN EATEN BY A BEAR, AND

26:11.500 --> 26:13.367
EVERY KITTEN'S PAWS COULD HAVE

26:13.433 --> 26:15.133
BEEN REPLACED BY

26:15.200 --> 26:16.233
OCTOPUS TENTACLES.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.800
ALL OF THAT IS VERY POSSIBLE,

26:17.867 --> 26:19.033
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S

26:19.100 --> 26:20.433
WHAT LIFE FUCKING IS NOW.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.700
BUT IF BOLSONARO HAS NOT WON, IF

26:21.767 --> 26:23.100
THERE IS GOING TO BE A RUNOFF IN

26:23.166 --> 26:25.033
THREE WEEKS, THEN IT STILL ISN'T

26:25.100 --> 26:26.200
TOO LATE.

26:26.266 --> 26:30.934
THAT'S THE THING.

26:31.033 --> 26:32.400
AND BRAZIL, PLEASE, LOOK, I

26:32.467 --> 26:33.633
REALIZE YOU ARE DISGUSTED WITH

26:33.700 --> 26:35.066
YOUR POLITICS AT THE MOMENT AND

26:35.133 --> 26:36.166
YOU'RE NOT INSPIRED BY ANY OF

26:36.233 --> 26:37.100
THE ALTERNATIVES.

26:37.166 --> 26:37.867
BUT ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN

26:37.934 --> 26:38.767
BOLSONARO.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.066
DIET LULA IS BETTER.

26:40.133 --> 26:40.900
SPIDER-MAN IS BETTER.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.867
GARY BUSEY IS BETTER.

26:42.934 --> 26:47.233
THAT IS GARY BUSEY.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.333
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S HIM.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.433
THE POINT IS, BOLSONARO DOES NOT

26:49.500 --> 26:50.600
REFLECT THE BEST OF WHO YOU ARE.

26:50.667 --> 26:51.967
AND WITH ANY LUCK, YOU STILL

26:52.066 --> 26:59.700
HAVE A CHANCE TO VOTE ELE NAO.

26:59.767 --> 27:00.367
AND NOT LET THIS MAN

27:00.433 --> 27:00.967
FINGERBANG YOUR DEMOCRACY.

27:01.033 --> 27:01.834
AND NOW THIS.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.066
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

27:03.133 --> 27:03.800
SEAN HANNITY'S MIDLIFE CRISIS.

27:03.867 --> 27:05.467
>> I TRAIN AN HOUR AND A HALF

27:05.533 --> 27:07.467
A DAY MIXED MARTIAL ARTS.

27:07.533 --> 27:08.967
I FIGHT, AND IT'S REAL FIGHTING.

27:09.033 --> 27:11.467
NOW, FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, I'VE

27:11.533 --> 27:13.200
BEEN DOING MIXED ARTS TRAINING.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.333
SEAN HANNITY IS GETTING VERY

27:14.400 --> 27:17.767
GOOD AT MARTIAL ARTS.

27:17.834 --> 27:18.500
I'M DOING MARTIAL ARTS, YOU

27:18.567 --> 27:18.700
KNOW.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.600
TO ME, THIS IS LIKE MY MARTIAL

27:19.667 --> 27:21.333
ARTS TRAINING.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.100
I GET UP EARLY AND DO MARTIAL

27:22.166 --> 27:22.667
ARTS.

27:22.734 --> 27:25.934
AND THIS IS MY FIST.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.066
YOU CAN PAN IN ON THAT.

27:27.133 --> 27:27.967
♪ ♪

27:28.033 --> 27:29.233
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.400
I DO STICK TRAINING.

27:30.467 --> 27:31.433
I DO BLADE TRAINING.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.567
FIREARM TRAINING.

27:32.633 --> 27:33.700
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING

27:33.767 --> 27:34.433
TO NECESSARILY REACT IN A

27:34.500 --> 27:38.200
SITUATION.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.367
BUT I TRAINED FOR THAT MOMENT.

27:39.433 --> 27:40.133
YOU AND I WOULD RUSH THEM

27:40.200 --> 27:43.700
TOGETHER.

27:43.767 --> 27:45.500
WE LOOK, WE WINK, AND WE GO.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.133
YOU'RE EITHER OUT IN, IT'S ALL

27:48.200 --> 27:50.033
OUT WAR, OR YOU'RE NOT IN AT

27:50.100 --> 27:53.000
ALL.

27:53.066 --> 27:56.300
I NOW DO 100 SIT-UPS, 100

27:56.367 --> 27:56.567
PUSH-UPS.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.767
I'M BOXING AND PUNCHING AND

27:57.834 --> 27:58.700
LEARNING, OBVIOUSLY, THE STREET

27:58.767 --> 28:00.367
MARTIAL ARTS.

28:00.433 --> 28:01.700
I NEVER WILL START A FIGHT, BUT

28:01.767 --> 28:02.934
IF SOMEBODY STARTS A FIGHT WITH

28:02.967 --> 28:04.467
ME, I'M GOING TO FINISH THE

28:04.533 --> 28:09.967
FIGHT.

28:10.033 --> 28:13.300
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

28:13.367 --> 28:17.533
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
