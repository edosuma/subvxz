01:12.240 --> 01:14.575
-We going.
-Do you wanna say hi?

01:14.608 --> 01:17.545
Can you say, "Hi, Daddy"?
Say hi to Daddy?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.413

Lucia didn't have the money.

02:21.910 --> 02:24.245
I gave her 48 hours to come up
with it,

she's gonna come through.

02:25.814 --> 02:27.748

looking for another buyer.

02:27.782 --> 02:29.951
(sighs) Why can't you do it?

02:29.984 --> 02:33.254
Because I am going to D.C.,

02:33.287 --> 02:34.989
and then to San Antonio
to make sure

02:35.023 --> 02:36.690

get to the Contras.

You remember what I told you

02:39.928 --> 02:42.163
about me not being
a drug dealer?

02:42.196 --> 02:43.965
All right, the sooner
we get the money,

02:43.998 --> 02:46.134
the sooner we can get
the supplies to your people.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.502
So just do what you can, okay?

10:06.974 --> 10:10.444
Great fucking hiding job!

10:10.478 --> 10:12.680
-I want some!
-LEON: Listen to your girl, man.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.382
That's what I was saying.

10:14.415 --> 10:16.116
For the last time, ain't nobody
doing this damn coke!

10:16.149 --> 10:17.885
-Damn!
-You gonna sell it?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.087
-'Cause I can help you sell it.
-You're not helping, Mel.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.922
We need to go back to
the Volpes, all right?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.424
They got titties all over
the place,

10:23.457 --> 10:24.892
and your friend's mom
is fine, too.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.794
I saw half her pussy
the last time.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.430
-Which half?
-Volpes already got enough coke.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.064
And I ain't nickel-and-diming
in the Valley.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.800
-That's how you get arrested.
-All right, all right.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.102
What about, like,
Bel Air or some shit?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.437
Ah-ah! I heard folks
up there got coin.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.606
You wanna go door-to-door
in Bel Air

10:38.639 --> 10:40.308
like we selling candy bars? KEVIN:
I don't know why y'all trippin'.

10:40.341 --> 10:44.312
I told y'all I got a cousin
named Devon up in Oakland.

10:44.345 --> 10:47.481
He got a gang of connections.
We could take a road trip.

10:47.515 --> 10:49.082
-Road trip?
-Yeah. Hell, yeah.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.384
Right? You wanna go
on a road trip, Melly Mel?

10:50.418 --> 10:52.119
-(chuckles) Maybe.
-Yeah?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.222
-Y'all are sounding crazy.
-Y'all did some, didn't you?

10:55.255 --> 10:58.326
-No. (sniffs)
-(laughs)

10:58.359 --> 11:01.228
(stifles laugh)

11:01.261 --> 11:02.663
Get your black asses
out my house.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.398
-Hey, man.
-Hey, what'd it feel like?

11:04.432 --> 11:06.266
-Ah, man, I can't even --
-Franklin, this shit's amazing!

11:06.300 --> 11:07.735
-I can't believe you.
-It's --

11:07.768 --> 11:09.136
-Come on, man.
-Hey, man! Hold up!

11:09.169 --> 11:11.305
Where you gonna
sell this shit at?

11:11.339 --> 11:12.773
-Once I figure that out...
-Hey!

11:12.806 --> 11:14.241
...and y'all two fools
sober up --

11:14.274 --> 11:15.676
Why I gotta leave?!
...I'll let y'all know.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.478
Because I got shit to do.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.912
-Hey, come on, man.
-Things I gotta do.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.148
-MELODY: Dang.
-FRANKLIN: Man, get out.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.083
Let's go find a pool
or something, man.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.018
Hey, man, I wanna swim.
Don't y'all wanna swim?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.421
You don't know how to swim. Man,
of course I know how to swim.

11:27.455 --> 11:30.591
Hey, you know, you look so good in
bikinis -- I'll take that, thank you.

11:30.624 --> 11:31.825
-Thanks, man.
-You're welcome.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.293
-KEVIN: Hey.
-MELODY: Come on.

11:33.327 --> 11:34.928
Come on, man.
Hey, don't shut us out. Hey!

11:34.962 --> 11:36.630
(woman speaking indistinctly
over PA)

11:36.664 --> 11:39.433
How many of these places
do you wanna check?

11:39.467 --> 11:41.635
As many as we have to.

11:44.672 --> 11:46.940
He might be dead already.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.810
(telephone ringing in distance)

11:49.843 --> 11:53.046
(sighs) So you know him
from Texas?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.215
Mm-hmm.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.685
From foster care.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.987
We came to L.A. together.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.756
Why didn't you guys
keep in touch?

12:04.592 --> 12:06.159
(speaks Spanish)

12:11.599 --> 12:14.802
(monitor beeping steadily,
telephone ringing)

12:14.835 --> 12:18.372
(man coughing)

12:18.406 --> 12:21.008
(indistinct conversations)

12:32.386 --> 12:33.887
Hernan.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.957
(machine whooshing)

12:40.360 --> 12:41.795
(speaking Spanish)

12:45.566 --> 12:48.101
What the fuck
are you doing here?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.740
Looking for you, ese.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.042
I wanna talk to you.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.848
-You brought your girlfriend?
-Business partner. Lucia.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.950
Nice to meet you.

13:04.652 --> 13:07.387
I don't know what kind of
business you got with Gustavo,

13:07.421 --> 13:09.289
but watch your back.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.060
He tends to run
when things get scary.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.896
Right, vato?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.066
How you doing, Hernan?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.734
(monitor beeps)

13:20.768 --> 13:22.936
I don't know yet.

13:22.970 --> 13:28.075
(woman speaking indistinctly
over PA)

13:28.108 --> 13:31.445
Any gang in the city would kill
to have access to our product.

13:31.479 --> 13:34.147
Why the fuck you talking to me
like you know me, jaina?

13:34.181 --> 13:38.919
Hey, man, all we're asking for
is an introduction.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.322
Those guys out there,
they're my brothers now.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.760
I say the word, and they bash
both your fucking heads in.

13:46.794 --> 13:49.162
They're gonna
pay your bills, too?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.665
Hmm?

13:51.699 --> 13:53.333
They're gonna look after Nuvia
and the children

13:53.366 --> 13:55.135
once you're gone?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.910
With dialysis, you live, what?
Five years?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.679
LUCIA:
My aunt lasted maybe three.

14:10.818 --> 14:12.452
(whispers) Right?

14:15.556 --> 14:18.626
You can't afford
not to help us, ese.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.531
What are you offering?

14:23.564 --> 14:25.699
(sighs)

14:25.733 --> 14:29.069
A cut from everything
Los Monarcas buy.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.408
(whispers)
Set up the meet.

14:36.644 --> 14:39.312
And if Stomper tells you
to go fuck yourself?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.682
Then we'll give you
a half-ounce of blow.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.817
Just for your trouble.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.356
I owe you, vato.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.294
I owe you.
Let me pay you back.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.763
órale.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.002
TEDDY: So the guns are being
held up at the depot

15:02.035 --> 15:04.838
by this mid-level prick
who thinks

15:04.872 --> 15:07.140
he isn't getting enough respect
from the Contras.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.676
I'm sure the Ambassador
just wants

15:08.709 --> 15:10.077
to be taken
into consideration.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.080
Okay, well, while he's
waiting for his ego

15:13.113 --> 15:16.717
to be properly stroked,
our guys are dying down there.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.853
It'll take some time to smooth
it over with the prick.

15:19.887 --> 15:21.722
How much time?

15:21.755 --> 15:24.658
You really want another
Bay of Pigs on your hands?

15:24.692 --> 15:27.327
I thought you had this
under control.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
-I do.
-And yet, here we are.

15:29.362 --> 15:34.001
Look, I just need
a little push.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.303
Be nice if it came
from the top.

15:37.571 --> 15:40.073
Looks like you had
some trouble in Honduras.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.744
I-I don't --
What does that mean?

15:43.777 --> 15:46.279
Do you need someone else
working with you on this?

15:46.313 --> 15:47.915
No.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.617
I-I already have somebody.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.619
He's a Nicaraguan national.
He's military-trained.

15:51.652 --> 15:53.253
He knows
what the stakes are.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.423
Okay, here's the progress report
for the President.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.226
The Contras will have everything
they need once they get those guns.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.728
(chuckles)

16:00.761 --> 16:02.395
You say that again,

16:02.429 --> 16:04.164
and you'll spend the rest
of your career behind a desk.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.402
Maybe I can go around
the Ambassador,

16:09.436 --> 16:12.139
hit up a buddy at the depot,
might expedite things.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.442
I'd appreciate that.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.979
You look like shit, Teddy.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.949
I appreciate that, too.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.418
I hope I haven't made
a mistake with you.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.689
You haven't.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.365
(line rings)

16:39.933 --> 16:42.135

16:42.169 --> 16:43.637

(Paul babbling)

16:45.372 --> 16:48.809
-Hello?
-TEDDY: Hey. It's me.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.980
Hi.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.614
Yeah, I, uh,

16:54.648 --> 16:57.651
I tried the office.
They said that you were home.

16:57.685 --> 17:00.688
(babbling)

17:02.022 --> 17:04.658
Sorry. (clears throat)

17:04.692 --> 17:07.527
Were we supposed to talk today?
(telephone clatters)

17:07.560 --> 17:11.264
Wh--No, I'm here.
I'm -- I'm in D.C.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.301
-I landed this afternoon.
-Oh.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.837
You know, I-I had a-a meeting
with James,

17:16.870 --> 17:20.373
but also I was, uh,
I was hoping I could see you.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.143
About?

17:24.812 --> 17:26.747
Okay. Um...

17:28.348 --> 17:31.018
You know, I've -- I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.053
Um...

17:33.086 --> 17:34.654
soul searching
or whatever.

17:34.688 --> 17:36.489
Look, I-I haven't stopped
thinking about you guys

17:36.523 --> 17:39.526
since you were
in Los Angeles.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.395
And, um, I want us to be
together.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.731
-And I miss you and --
-Teddy, stop.

17:43.764 --> 17:45.298
-No, just hear me out, please.
-Stop.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.134
Give me that much, at least.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.469
You know, I-I could've just
shown up at your door,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.404
but I'm trying to do this
the right way.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.241
Please.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.676
Julia.

17:56.710 --> 17:59.379
If you come over,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.248
I don't want any bullshit.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.816
Yeah.

18:02.850 --> 18:05.819
And I don't know if I want us
to be together.

18:05.853 --> 18:08.288
I understand.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.260
I want Thai food.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.896
I'll see you at 8.

Ah. (chuckles)

Yeah.

18:49.763 --> 18:51.965
A man gotta know
how to survive.

Louie leave me,
I know how to eat.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.771
Why you laughing?

18:57.805 --> 18:59.206

18:59.239 --> 19:01.909
Um...

19:01.942 --> 19:04.277
(bills rustle)

19:04.311 --> 19:07.047
For the gun.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.883
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.419
Something tell me this more than
the reason why you here.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.324
I mean, I'm...

19:18.758 --> 19:21.328
I know you don't want in
on the coke business.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.764
I just wanna know why.

19:24.798 --> 19:27.901
I-I mean,
you smart, plenty hard.

19:27.935 --> 19:29.169
Hmm.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.005
And I know you like
that paper.

19:32.039 --> 19:35.075
So if you ain't in the game,
there's gotta be a good reason.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.444
About 18 months ago,

19:37.477 --> 19:39.579
some niggas jacked
this Mexican diesel truck.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.949
(mouth full)
Full of cocaine.

19:41.982 --> 19:44.584
Before that, we were somewhat
a'ight with the Mexicans.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.288
And a lot of people got tapped behind
that situation. (beads rattle)

19:48.321 --> 19:52.192
And that's the first reason
I don't fuck with no yeyo.

19:53.393 --> 19:57.030
Rule number two,
'cause there ain't no winners.

19:57.064 --> 19:58.966
Them pigs, they ready
to put you in the clink.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.201
-And -- and they will.
-Mm-hmm.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.137
Now rule number three,

20:04.171 --> 20:07.841
you gotta sell to white folk.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.610
Them places where you
gon' stick out,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.345

That's right.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.215
(chuckles)

20:15.248 --> 20:16.683
There's gotta be a way
I can do this

20:16.716 --> 20:19.152
without ending up dead
or in jail.

20:19.186 --> 20:21.688
(exhales) Only way
you can make it safe

20:21.721 --> 20:25.658
is selling right here,
in your own hood.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.061
Just like I do
with my bud.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.366
They can't afford no blow.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.603
Take him to Knees'.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.473
Who?

20:40.507 --> 20:43.043
Better he hear it from somebody
who ain't related to him.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.812
Go and wait
out in the car.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.348
Go on. I'll be out there
in a minute.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.889

-What? I'm sayin'...

20:55.923 --> 20:58.425
(beads rattle, door opens)

21:01.728 --> 21:03.763
Appreciate you
handling with me.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.398
Mm-hmm.

21:05.432 --> 21:09.036
You sure did change your tune
real quick.

21:09.069 --> 21:10.737
What you got
up your sleeve?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.440
Nothin'.
What you got up yours?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.608
Mm.
Mmm!

21:15.642 --> 21:20.280
