WEBVTT

00:01.833 --> 00:04.400
So, I've got this friend
and, uh, great guy,

00:04.435 --> 00:06.169
a little stubborn,
but, as life would have it,

00:06.203 --> 00:07.639
- he's got cancer.
- Is that so?

00:07.674 --> 00:09.554
Don't worry. He's keeping
his head up, staying positive.

00:09.589 --> 00:12.679
- And, uh, here's the thing...
- Oh, there's a thing.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.348
I assumed cancer was the big twist.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.015
No, see, my friend
recently got this new doctor

00:16.050 --> 00:18.252
who, uh, as it turns out,
is making it really hard

00:18.286 --> 00:19.753
for my friend to stay positive.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.421
Hang on, this sounds
like somebody I know.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.523
Really? Weird.

00:22.557 --> 00:23.857
Not only did she put my friend on

00:23.892 --> 00:25.626
an impossible to maintain schedule,

00:25.660 --> 00:28.662
but now she's insisting that
my friend get a feeding tube.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.330
So he was really hoping

00:30.365 --> 00:32.031
that he could get a second opinion.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.767
And your friend wouldn't
also happen to be

00:33.801 --> 00:35.435
the medical director
of a major public hospital

00:35.481 --> 00:36.770
- in New York, would they?
- Well, uh, he asked me

00:36.804 --> 00:38.467
to keep his name out of it.

00:38.501 --> 00:39.867
- Max, I...
- No, no names.

00:39.901 --> 00:41.037
That would be a huge betrayal

00:41.072 --> 00:42.196
to my incredibly private friend.

00:42.231 --> 00:43.877
But my friend was wondering

00:43.912 --> 00:46.346
if maybe you could talk to Dr. Stauton

00:46.381 --> 00:47.705
and change her mind?

00:47.739 --> 00:50.384
- I will do no such thing.
- I'm this way.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.619
Which is why I'm going this way.

00:52.654 --> 00:55.689
Okay. But she's totally gone rogue.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.524
Okay? She peppers all her diagnoses

00:57.559 --> 00:59.626
- with basketball analogies.
- Sometimes you've just got

00:59.661 --> 01:01.644
- to shoot from mid-court.
- No. Not you too.

01:01.678 --> 01:03.297
Max, you're on the fourth foul

01:03.331 --> 01:04.831
- and there are no timeouts left.
- Okay, this basketball thing

01:04.866 --> 01:06.300
is spinning out of control.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.701
Just a second opinion on a feeding tube.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.970
That's all I'm asking for.

01:08.995 --> 01:10.804
- Okay. You want my second opinion?
- Yes.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.507
You need to listen to your actual doctor.

01:16.711 --> 01:19.513
I see what you did there.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.386
- If it makes you feel better...
- I'm sure it won't.

01:26.421 --> 01:28.522
Think of the feeding tube
like the sixth man

01:28.556 --> 01:30.857
coming off the bench when
the starters need a break.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.993
Really? 'Cause I see it more like a pipe

01:33.027 --> 01:36.019
protruding from my stomach,
spilling my morning coffee.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.498
The chemo has left you
with frequent nausea.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.767
The radiation has burned your throat.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.736
As a result, you have been eating less.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.226
You've lost five pounds in one week.

01:45.261 --> 01:48.375
Malnutrition negatively
affects your treatment.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.844
It can also impair muscle function,

01:50.878 --> 01:52.746
decrease immunoresponse,

01:52.780 --> 01:57.517
and amass dangerous toxicity
levels within your body.

01:57.552 --> 02:01.021
Max, inserting a feeding tube
will mitigate that.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.995
Okay, yeah.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.933
Put me in, Coach.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:16.904 --> 02:18.772
These site visits are really
more of a formality

02:18.806 --> 02:19.807
at this point, so...

02:19.842 --> 02:21.052
I've been looking forward to it.

02:21.086 --> 02:22.506
Oh.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.745
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, here we go.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.079
These are Jemma's favorites.

02:26.114 --> 02:27.881
They're from a
little Trinidadian restaurant

02:27.915 --> 02:30.083
near the hospital the kids
order from sometimes.

02:30.118 --> 02:33.120
Once, no joke, Jemma ate four of these.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.088
I mean, I might have helped
a little bit, but...

02:35.123 --> 02:36.623
Hope you brought enough to share.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.072
No, no. There will be no sharing.

02:38.106 --> 02:41.428
Once I put these down in front
of her, watch your fingers.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.130
- Hey, Jemma.
- Hey, kiddo.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.356
How you doing, Jemma?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.601
I'm fine.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.738
Well, uh, I hope you're ready
to be awesome

02:51.773 --> 02:56.076
because I brought doubles and
kurma from Leelee's Roti Shop.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.078
Boom.

03:00.048 --> 03:01.748
I'm good.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.185
Okay, well, I'll leave
them here on the counter

03:05.219 --> 03:07.504
if you want them later, okay?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.662
Everything's okay?

03:15.697 --> 03:17.597
Oh, she's just cramming for a test.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.599
- Oh.
- Things have been great.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.967
So everything's okay with school?

03:21.002 --> 03:22.636
Yeah, her teachers at Jefferson

03:22.670 --> 03:24.037
say she's catching up.

03:24.072 --> 03:26.640
- And her friends?
- I met most of them.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.110
Good kids. Creative, misfits, like Jemma.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.612
But they really seem to get each other.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.182
Seems to me she's settling in just fine.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.684
So Dr. Christiansen will finish up

03:37.719 --> 03:39.304
with the low pitches now.

03:39.338 --> 03:42.703
As before, raise your right
hand if you hear a sound.

03:42.737 --> 03:44.691
If you don't, it's okay.

03:44.726 --> 03:46.193
This is to help us diagnose

03:46.227 --> 03:48.712
what's going wrong
with the cochlear implant.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.131
Margot?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.669
Do you need a break?
Is everything all right?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.840
She doesn't like tests.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.742
It's the device we are testing, not you.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.176
And if it makes you feel better,

04:03.211 --> 04:06.213
I will give you an A+. Hmm?

04:06.247 --> 04:07.981
Tori and I will be just outside the door.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.149
Okay.

04:10.118 --> 04:12.219
Okay, let's start.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.889
So, it's been nine months.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.257
We're still having problems?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.226
It's almost impossible to predict

04:20.261 --> 04:24.164
the rehabilitation period
after a cochlear implant.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.201
I mean, we weren't expecting
her to talk on the phone

04:28.236 --> 04:32.172
but she can't even take the
subway without getting dizzy.

04:32.206 --> 04:35.008
She seems confused and sad.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.545
I know how it feels to see
your loved ones in pain,

04:38.579 --> 04:43.016
but once we diagnose the issue
with the device, we can fix it.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.023
Is everything okay?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.691
The implant seems to be functional.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.528
- Basal electrode responses?
- All normal.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.099
So it's not the device,
then what's the matter?

05:04.238 --> 05:06.206
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Max.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.908
Dr. Reynolds.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.743
Why do I feel like the two
of you are getting ready

05:09.777 --> 05:11.211
to throw me into an unmarked van?

05:11.245 --> 05:13.747
Heh. Your quarterly budget
is three weeks late.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.216
Oh, yeah. See, what had happened was...

05:16.250 --> 05:17.884
Yeah, and if it's not done today,

05:17.919 --> 05:19.886
then cardiothoracic is going
to have no budget

05:19.921 --> 05:21.321
- for next quarter.
- Which means

05:21.355 --> 05:23.056
no surgical supplies, no surgeons,

05:23.090 --> 05:24.422
and no surgeries.

05:24.456 --> 05:27.060
Luckily for you, we have a Dora

05:27.094 --> 05:28.995
and Dora is going to, uh, help you.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.932
And by help you, I mean torture
you until it's finished.

05:31.966 --> 05:34.734
Every line in perfect order,
back-to-back.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.236
She's really kind of tough.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.905
So you are here by sequestered
to this office

05:38.940 --> 05:42.275
until it's done or, um,

05:42.310 --> 05:44.845
you're dead, whichever comes first.

05:44.879 --> 05:47.247
- Wait, you mean now?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.949
No, but... but they need me on the floor.

05:48.983 --> 05:50.951
- Uhp-uhp-uhp.
- Can't somebody else do this?

05:50.985 --> 05:53.820
It's your department. Your budget.

05:53.855 --> 05:56.590
You get everything you want.
You just have to ask for it.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.593
In a properly formatted
Excel-generated spreadsheet.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.195
And Dora really excels at this.

06:02.230 --> 06:03.763
No, it's not funny? Okay.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.298
Well, smile and nod
or pay the price later.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.033
Max, come on! I'm a doctor!

06:07.068 --> 06:08.368
Yeah, not without a budget.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.370
Shall we, Dr. Reynolds?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.272
Can I at least go to the bathroom first?

06:12.306 --> 06:14.774
Mm, I think you know the answer to that.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.347
Everybody out of the way.
Yo! Clear the way!

06:22.083 --> 06:24.384
Jeez, Marie. I turn
my back for two seconds...

06:24.418 --> 06:26.319
- It should've been you.
- Oh, nice.

06:26.354 --> 06:27.821
- All right, what do you got?
- Marie McNeil.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.289
40-year-old female police officer

06:29.323 --> 06:30.957
- on foot when struck...
- By a drunk driver.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.692
- Hit and run.
- All right. We got it. Thanks.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.394
Motor vehicle struck right
leg fracturing the femur.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.630
She bounced off the hood
followed by the road,

06:36.664 --> 06:38.698
resulting in thoracic abrasions
and contusions.

06:38.733 --> 06:39.931
She's going to be all right, right?

06:39.965 --> 06:40.990
Why don't you alert her family?

06:41.024 --> 06:42.060
Let them know where she is.

06:42.094 --> 06:43.511
I'm her partner. I'm her family.

06:43.545 --> 06:44.971
All right, let's get her to bay 29

06:45.005 --> 06:47.707
- and get Max down here now.
- Hang in there, okay?

06:47.742 --> 06:49.843
Be okay. Please.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.347
Give us some room. She's okay.

06:58.286 --> 07:00.887
Yeah, I... I hear you,
Commissioner. Of course.

07:00.922 --> 07:02.157
No, you have my word.

07:02.191 --> 07:04.904
Officer McNeil will receive
the very best care possible.

07:04.939 --> 07:06.711
We've got everything under control.

07:06.712 --> 07:09.013
Yes. No, thank you, sir.

07:09.047 --> 07:10.965
- Police Commissioner?
- The one and only.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.884
You ever experience a blue wave?

07:12.918 --> 07:14.252
Uh, sure. In Chinatown.

07:14.286 --> 07:15.953
Then you haven't experienced a blue wave.

07:15.988 --> 07:17.622
At New Amsterdam, when a cop is
brought in,

07:17.656 --> 07:19.123
it's like his whole family
comes with them,

07:19.158 --> 07:21.292
only that family is 3/4 of the NYPD.

07:23.128 --> 07:25.696
- As advertised.
- I see what you mean.

07:25.731 --> 07:27.965
Uh, everyone? I'm Max Goodwin,
the medical director.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.967
Hi, I appreciate that you want
to support your colleague,

07:30.002 --> 07:31.736
but this is still a functioning ED.

07:31.770 --> 07:34.572
Go ahead. So we need to keep
this area clear and calm,

07:34.606 --> 07:35.973
if at all possible.

07:36.008 --> 07:37.642
I'd like to ask everyone
to move this vigil

07:37.676 --> 07:39.710
outside these doors.
We really appreciate it.

07:39.745 --> 07:42.046
Leon Hargrow. 68. Probable DUI.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.881
Lacerations to left forearm.

07:43.916 --> 07:45.883
Chemical burns on his face
and hands from the airbag.

07:45.918 --> 07:48.786
I didn't see. Where...

07:48.821 --> 07:51.088
Where... where am I?

07:51.123 --> 07:52.657
Any sign of head injury?

07:52.691 --> 07:54.225
Witnesses saw him swerving
all over the road

07:54.259 --> 07:56.376
- before the accident.
- That's him!

07:56.962 --> 07:58.329
That's the DUI who hit Marie!

07:58.363 --> 07:59.897
Someone call security.

07:59.932 --> 08:01.799
I think security is covered.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.569
You're going down
for a long time, you hear me?

08:04.603 --> 08:06.070
- Easy, easy.
- I know you can hear me!

08:06.104 --> 08:07.638
I'm gonna make sure you're locked up

08:07.673 --> 08:09.640
for the rest of your sorry-assed life!

08:09.675 --> 08:11.108
Easy! Get him back! Get him back!

08:11.143 --> 08:12.977
Back up! Back up, now!

08:13.011 --> 08:15.213
- You're not getting away!
- Get him back! Get him back!

08:19.745 --> 08:22.713
Angelo's been Marie's
partner going on eight years.

08:22.747 --> 08:25.182
These two are like sister and brother.

08:25.216 --> 08:27.684
He's messed up, but he was
never going to do anything

08:27.719 --> 08:29.720
- to that driver.
- You sure about that?

08:29.754 --> 08:31.536
What can I say?

08:32.090 --> 08:33.756
We take care of our own.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.259
Yeah, well, as long as you
take care of Angelo,

08:35.293 --> 08:37.094
I got no problem
with you guys being here.

08:37.128 --> 08:39.596
I'm sorry for the disruption.
It won't happen again.

08:39.631 --> 08:41.265
Our full focus needs to be on Marie.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.799
Her recovery is what's important.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.902
Not to worry. He'll get it together.

08:44.936 --> 08:46.937
Thanks. I'll, uh, keep you updated

08:46.971 --> 08:48.205
as I learn more about her progress.

08:48.239 --> 08:49.873
- Thank you.
- You got it.

08:49.908 --> 08:51.742
Hey, how's she doing?

08:51.776 --> 08:54.278
Stable-ish. She's pretty banged up.

08:54.312 --> 08:56.180
I'm waiting on a cardio consult.

08:57.816 --> 08:59.283
What about the driver? How's he doing?

08:59.317 --> 09:01.318
Waiting on lab results
from his tox screen.

09:01.352 --> 09:03.253
We need to put some distance between him

09:03.288 --> 09:05.088
and Marie's partner.

09:05.123 --> 09:07.257
Driver's stable. He can move.

09:07.292 --> 09:09.126
Do it.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.762
- Where should we put him?
- I cleared a bed in the ICU.

09:11.796 --> 09:13.130
He's still out.

09:13.164 --> 09:15.866
It is going to be one hell
of a rude awakening.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:40.024 --> 09:42.159
Oh, there he is! Just
the boss I was looking for!

09:42.193 --> 09:43.660
Can I get an autograph on this?

09:43.695 --> 09:45.295
- You bet.
- Thank you.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.197
Not everyone would sign
their kidneys away like that

09:47.232 --> 09:48.832
but I really need the money,
so thank you.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.467
Give me that.
Another site visit for Jemma?

09:50.501 --> 09:52.102
I thought you just had one of these.

09:52.136 --> 09:53.370
Yeah, I thought you had cancer.

09:53.404 --> 09:54.705
Only on the inside.

09:54.739 --> 09:56.206
Okay, well, yeah, so

09:56.241 --> 09:57.941
I'm a little worried Jemma
might be isolating.

09:57.976 --> 09:59.776
She literally said three words to me,

09:59.811 --> 10:01.345
went back in her room,
and didn't come back out again.

10:01.379 --> 10:03.046
Can I give you my completely

10:03.081 --> 10:04.982
unqualified psychological diagnosis?

10:05.016 --> 10:08.018
- Sure, why not?
- She's a teenager.

10:08.052 --> 10:10.220
Well, yeah...

10:23.067 --> 10:26.136
- Yo, can I get a consult?
- Oh, thank God.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.471
How can I help?

10:27.505 --> 10:29.072
You can tell me who on your team

10:29.107 --> 10:31.208
- is available for a consult.
- Me.

10:31.242 --> 10:35.913
Lab supplies and consumables. $14,400.87.

10:35.947 --> 10:38.348
Max, please.

10:38.383 --> 10:40.384
What do you got for me?

10:40.418 --> 10:41.752
This isn't fair.

10:41.786 --> 10:43.020
Look, if I had known

10:43.054 --> 10:44.388
it was going to be this much paperwork,

10:44.422 --> 10:46.056
I would've never signed up to be Chair.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.058
Ah, you didn't. I kind of
forced you to be Chair.

10:48.092 --> 10:49.793
Sorry about that.

10:50.929 --> 10:54.064
Pull Hastings off her VATS procedure.

10:54.098 --> 10:55.597
Thank you.

10:56.467 --> 10:59.803
Nice try. Next line item?

11:07.278 --> 11:08.946
Is everything okay? Are you all right?

11:08.980 --> 11:11.081
I'm sorry.

11:12.450 --> 11:14.785
I'm usually not like this.
Neither of us are.

11:14.819 --> 11:17.087
No, it's... it's...

11:17.121 --> 11:18.822
it's all right.

11:21.259 --> 11:22.926
I don't know what happened.

11:23.374 --> 11:25.502
We literally never fight.

11:26.331 --> 11:29.032
We met at a meditation workshop.

11:33.838 --> 11:35.472
Margo being able to hear,

11:35.506 --> 11:38.223
this was supposed to bring us
closer together,

11:39.474 --> 11:41.345
but it's just driving us apart.

11:44.315 --> 11:45.897
Tori, I...

11:46.851 --> 11:48.585
I know someone who could help.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.955
Okay.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.613
Margot.

12:16.647 --> 12:18.048
Margot.

12:23.855 --> 12:25.922
I believe there may be issues
that aren't related

12:25.957 --> 12:28.392
to your cochlear implant.

12:29.193 --> 12:31.228
This is my colleague, Dr. Frome.

12:32.230 --> 12:33.862
Let's talk.

12:34.565 --> 12:36.633
Mmm.

12:38.236 --> 12:40.003
Uh, Max.

12:40.038 --> 12:42.105
Okay, before you speak,
you should know that my friend,

12:42.140 --> 12:43.340
the one with the cancer,

12:43.374 --> 12:44.608
is getting a PEG tube installed today.

12:44.642 --> 12:47.144
So this donut represents his last meal.

12:47.178 --> 12:49.112
Assuming he can, you know, swallow it.

12:49.147 --> 12:50.647
Leon Hargrow wasn't drunk.

12:50.681 --> 12:53.016
- The driver?
- I just got his blood work.

12:53.051 --> 12:55.285
There were no drugs or alcohol
in his system. None.

12:55.319 --> 12:57.287
But people saw him swerving?

12:57.321 --> 13:00.624
He had a stroke behind the wheel.

13:00.658 --> 13:02.492
- And that's not all...
- Dr. Goodwin.

13:02.527 --> 13:04.061
I can't find Angelo.

13:04.095 --> 13:05.562
No one knows where he went.

13:05.596 --> 13:07.297
You don't think he went after...

13:07.331 --> 13:09.366
Yeah, I do.

13:20.244 --> 13:21.978
Angelo?

13:27.585 --> 13:29.586
Officer, back away
from that bed right now.

13:34.092 --> 13:36.560
Hey, let's talk about this.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.496
Somebody's got to pay.

13:39.969 --> 13:42.165
Angelo, I understand that you're upset,

13:42.200 --> 13:43.433
but this wasn't his fault.

13:43.468 --> 13:45.268
Don't give me that.

13:45.303 --> 13:47.704
He was wasted. I saw him swerving.

13:48.144 --> 13:51.403
He had an embolic stroke
while he was driving.

13:53.277 --> 13:56.012
He wasn't drunk. He's very sick.

13:56.047 --> 14:00.150
He's a vet, have some compassion.

14:03.387 --> 14:05.956
Angelo, please.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.024
Go back downstairs to the waiting area.

14:08.059 --> 14:09.926
Your partner?

14:09.961 --> 14:11.542
She needs you right now.

14:13.131 --> 14:15.599
Make sure that you get him downstairs.

14:15.633 --> 14:18.341
- Uh, what... wait, what is it?
- It's Marie. She's coding.

14:19.137 --> 14:21.705
O-2 sat down to 86.
Respirations up to 30.

14:21.739 --> 14:23.940
Decreased breath sounds bilaterally!

14:23.975 --> 14:26.599
- Heart rate's down to 48.
- Hang in there, Marie!

14:28.669 --> 14:31.303
- O-2 sat dropping.
- Respiratory rate climb.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.195
I've got to get
What tthe pulmonary kit. on?

14:33.230 --> 14:35.006
Dropping an intubation tray now.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.208
Neck vein distention. Both sides.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.312
It's hard to see because of the
cervical collar but it's there.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.981
- Pneumomediastinum.
- Yeah.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.293
Good call.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.962
There must be a hole
in Marie's esophagus.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.330
We need to get her to the OR,

14:58.364 --> 15:00.031
open up her chest and close that hole

15:00.066 --> 15:02.367
before this happens again.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.140
Is she going to be okay?

15:09.486 --> 15:11.320
- Mr. Hargrow...
- I need to see her.

15:11.354 --> 15:13.184
- Look, sir...
- I need to tell her I'm sorry.

15:13.218 --> 15:15.870
Sir, you... you need to remain calm.

15:15.904 --> 15:18.227
- But...
- I promise you,

15:18.261 --> 15:20.820
she is receiving the best care possible.

15:21.998 --> 15:24.533
But right now, we need to focus on you.

15:32.415 --> 15:36.345
The stroke that you had was
caused by a malignant tumor

15:36.379 --> 15:38.881
in your bladder.

15:38.915 --> 15:41.517
I know that this is distressing news.

15:41.551 --> 15:43.552
We need to remove your tumor immediately

15:43.586 --> 15:45.754
- and start you on a regimen.
- All I want to know

15:45.789 --> 15:48.598
is if that woman is going to live.

15:49.893 --> 15:52.266
Mr. Hargrow,
your condition is very serious.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.145
I already know what's wrong with me.

15:55.532 --> 15:57.800
How long have you known?

16:00.109 --> 16:04.039
If you knew, then why on earth
haven't you gotten treatment?

16:04.074 --> 16:05.841
I don't want treatment.

16:06.198 --> 16:09.378
I just want to apologize for what I did.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.624
I understand.

16:15.666 --> 16:18.243
But right now, that is not a good idea

16:18.278 --> 16:20.045
for either of you.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.682
Then I guess there's
nothing else to talk about.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.092
Dr. Kapoor thought
that it would be beneficial

16:34.127 --> 16:37.162
if we sit down and talk
about what's happening

16:37.196 --> 16:38.964
during the rehab process.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.233
And that's sort of my...
my job around here

16:41.267 --> 16:42.968
is to create an environment

16:43.002 --> 16:46.171
or space to explore what's
happening to you emotionally.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.639
Both of you.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.007
The interpreter will be here very soon.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.201
I assure you.

16:51.369 --> 16:53.979
I'm, uh... I'm very sorry
about the delay.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.790
Should be any moment.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.294
Oh, okay. We're just diving right in.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.887
Um...

17:12.999 --> 17:15.434
Angry? I... uh...

17:21.487 --> 17:22.753
Okay, can we just...

17:22.779 --> 17:24.746
Guys, can we slow down just a touch?

17:24.978 --> 17:27.980
Um, just... I'm getting some of it.

17:28.276 --> 17:29.991
It's just... a little too fast.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.883
I have never said you were a burden.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.020
Okay, time out. Time. Time out.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.823
Um, take a breath. Okay?

17:37.857 --> 17:41.377
I need to catch up here,
but I'm assuming, um...

17:41.828 --> 17:44.229
Tori, Margo said that
she feels like a burden.

17:44.505 --> 17:46.064
- Yeah.
- Is that right?

17:46.099 --> 17:49.568
Okay, is that... is that
how you feel about her?

17:50.052 --> 17:54.206
No. I have never thought of her that way.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.975
All right, so why don't you tell her

17:57.010 --> 17:58.777
how you do feel about her?

18:01.355 --> 18:03.915
Margot has just always had
this spirit in her

18:03.950 --> 18:07.653
that had to experience the world,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.755
on her own terms.

18:09.789 --> 18:14.192
Margot bungee jumped off the
Manhattan bridge at 3:00 a.m.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.061
when we were in college.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.997
Are you kidding? Wow.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.099
Right.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.968
I think that she's fearless.

18:26.485 --> 18:28.219
So tell her.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.157
"I feel so far away
from that person right now.

18:46.893 --> 18:50.062
"I know I pushed us here
because I wanted the implant

18:50.096 --> 18:52.197
"and you supported me through all of it,

18:52.231 --> 18:54.332
"with the money and the surgeries,

18:56.120 --> 18:57.988
"because I wanted it.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.192
"And now I'm afraid that I've risked

19:04.226 --> 19:08.964
the most important relationship
in my life because of them."

19:17.039 --> 19:19.474
Why do you want the implant?

19:21.097 --> 19:22.397
"So I can hear."

19:22.511 --> 19:25.940
Well, okay. That's what the implant does.

19:26.949 --> 19:29.184
Why do you want the implant?

19:44.612 --> 19:46.380
"I want it..."

19:52.208 --> 19:53.441
Oh...

20:07.556 --> 20:10.058
Appreciate it. Thank you.

20:10.092 --> 20:11.610
Throw it in there. Thanks, bud.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.946
How you doing? Hey, good to see you.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.731
Thanks. Thank you.

20:20.403 --> 20:22.337
Yo, Recetti.

20:24.073 --> 20:26.041
You already taking up
for Marie's funeral?

20:26.075 --> 20:29.044
Relax. It's for her recovery.

20:29.078 --> 20:32.006
She's gonna be ordering takeout
for a while after this.

20:35.084 --> 20:36.385
Thanks.

20:38.207 --> 20:39.974
- What's going on?
- How is she?

20:39.999 --> 20:42.066
We stabilized her and we're
prepping her for surgery.

20:42.091 --> 20:43.725
Now she's not out of the woods yet,

20:43.759 --> 20:46.127
but she does seem to be
responding to treatment.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.462
Is that for Marie?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.230
Yeah, it's something the PD does.

20:49.265 --> 20:50.498
We have a fallen heroes fund

20:50.533 --> 20:52.067
for officers hurt in the line of duty.

20:52.101 --> 20:53.635
Then count me in.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.437
I'll let you know when she's out.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.638
Hey.

20:57.706 --> 20:59.574
Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.

20:59.608 --> 21:00.910
Sure.

21:03.646 --> 21:05.613
Guess who's back?

21:05.648 --> 21:08.783
Is it legit or did you
"Shawshank" your way out of it?

21:08.818 --> 21:10.048
Hey, you know what?

21:10.073 --> 21:11.977
After spending the afternoon with Dora,

21:12.021 --> 21:13.988
I finally know how the lights
stay on in this place.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.690
- What do we got?
- Boerhaave's esophagus,

21:15.724 --> 21:17.459
surgical repair.

21:18.941 --> 21:21.509
Oh, looks good. Let's get to work.

21:25.301 --> 21:26.634
Officer McNeil,

21:26.669 --> 21:29.170
I'm Dr. Reynolds. This is Dr. Hastings.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.231
We're going to be performing
your surgery today.

21:32.408 --> 21:34.442
Two doctors?

21:34.477 --> 21:36.277
Must be pretty bad.

21:36.312 --> 21:39.647
Vitals are good. We'll see you in there.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.386
You've had a morning.

21:45.421 --> 21:48.823
Yeah, cops are supposed
to go down chasing the bad guy.

21:48.858 --> 21:50.692
I get clipped writing a traffic ticket

21:50.726 --> 21:53.361
to a grown man on a scooter.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.829
I'm never gonna hear the end of it.

21:56.499 --> 21:58.700
Hey, well, at least
you were out there, all right?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.202
I spent my morning sitting
in front of a spreadsheet.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.705
Oof, I hate desk work.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.573
Tell me about it.

22:05.608 --> 22:08.576
Put me on the street.
That's where I want to be.

22:08.611 --> 22:10.545
- In the action, right?
- Yeah.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.482
My partner, he calls me "one direction"

22:14.183 --> 22:16.484
'cause I always head straight in.

22:16.519 --> 22:19.613
I don't even think about it.
I don't get scared.

22:20.222 --> 22:23.450
Put me in the line of fire
when somebody needs help.

22:24.627 --> 22:27.362
That's my happy place.

22:29.532 --> 22:31.533
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

22:31.567 --> 22:33.568
helping you right now?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.803
That's my happy place.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.211
I'll see you in there.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.596
VA just sent over his records.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.073
Oh, thank you.

23:05.901 --> 23:08.736
You've got to be kidding me.

23:11.740 --> 23:13.541
- Kapoor.
- How did it go?

23:13.576 --> 23:15.177
Well, it was good. Very optimistic.

23:15.211 --> 23:17.745
You know a lot... a lot came out.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.581
There was a definite unearthing going on.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.816
But ultimately, I do believe
that Tori and Margot

23:21.850 --> 23:23.751
are going to be stronger than ever.

23:23.786 --> 23:25.620
- That's wonderful news.
- Yeah.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.012
I've discussed with Dr. Christiansen,

23:27.047 --> 23:30.291
and she's confident that we
can move forward with the MRI.

23:30.326 --> 23:34.229
Well, actually Margot touched
on something really profound.

23:34.263 --> 23:36.297
- Powerful.
- What?

23:36.332 --> 23:39.701
She would like to have
her cochlear implant removed.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.605
Vijay, she wants to be deaf again.

23:53.449 --> 23:55.850
"It matters not how strait the gate,

23:55.885 --> 23:57.986
"how charged with punishments the scroll,

23:58.020 --> 24:01.289
"I am the master of my fate,

24:01.324 --> 24:04.993
I am the captain of my soul."

24:10.366 --> 24:12.567
Cap refill less than two seconds.

24:15.237 --> 24:17.072
Patient induced.

24:21.677 --> 24:24.579
20 micrograms of fentanyl.

24:27.029 --> 24:28.763
T-probe and defib...

24:30.132 --> 24:31.099
Standing by.

24:37.573 --> 24:40.441
<i>♪ I'm so tired of being alone ♪</i>

24:40.476 --> 24:42.677
♪ <i> I'm so tired of on my own</i> ♪

24:42.711 --> 24:44.712
♪ <i> Won't you help me, girl</i> ♪

24:44.746 --> 24:48.816
♪ <i> Just as soon as you can</i> ♪

24:51.487 --> 24:53.387
You've tried to get
treatment two years ago,

24:53.422 --> 24:54.989
didn't you Leon?

24:55.023 --> 24:56.312
Tried.

24:56.925 --> 24:58.960
I went and saw my doc at the VA.

24:58.994 --> 25:01.483
They took me in right away
like they usually do.

25:02.492 --> 25:04.526
Once they found out what I had,

25:04.551 --> 25:06.719
they said they didn't have
the right doctor for me there.

25:06.744 --> 25:08.444
Said that I had to go somewhere else.

25:08.469 --> 25:11.404
So they gave you a voucher
and sent you on your way.

25:11.429 --> 25:12.863
Yeah.

25:16.434 --> 25:19.870
But you didn't use it.

25:22.107 --> 25:23.714
I wanted to.

25:24.376 --> 25:26.577
But the voucher didn't cover everything.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.384
I'm on my own.

25:34.719 --> 25:37.021
Couldn't afford the difference.

25:39.424 --> 25:41.725
I served my country with pride.

25:44.629 --> 25:46.897
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

25:50.568 --> 25:52.368
I did four tours.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.079
Army Rangers.

25:58.009 --> 26:01.045
You deserve better than this.

26:04.015 --> 26:06.884
I never meant to put anyone
in harm's way.

26:13.358 --> 26:15.826
Max, I am scheduling Leon Hargrow

26:15.860 --> 26:18.062
for emergency bladder surgery
and radiation.

26:18.096 --> 26:20.431
- Well, let's hope he needs it.
- Turns out the VA closed

26:20.465 --> 26:22.332
their urology department,
so instead of treating him,

26:22.367 --> 26:23.767
they gave him a voucher to use

26:23.802 --> 26:24.968
at a hospital of his "choice."

26:25.003 --> 26:26.503
We'll take a voucher.

26:26.538 --> 26:28.138
The voucher only covers 75% of the cost.

26:28.173 --> 26:29.673
- He's stuck with the rest.
- We'll cover the rest.

26:29.707 --> 26:30.974
What's the problem again?

26:31.009 --> 26:32.910
Do they think that Leon only gave 75%

26:32.944 --> 26:34.511
while he was in Vietnam?

26:34.546 --> 26:36.080
Not to mention
there's compelling evidence

26:36.114 --> 26:37.915
that urothelial carcinoma
is a directly related

26:37.949 --> 26:39.616
to exposure to Agent Orange.

26:39.651 --> 26:41.018
Helen, this is a public hospital.

26:41.052 --> 26:42.519
This is why we're here.

26:42.554 --> 26:44.521
If the VA won't treat Leon, we will.

26:44.556 --> 26:45.989
No, you won't.

26:46.024 --> 26:48.025
HCC was notified of
a payment being submitted

26:48.059 --> 26:49.674
via a VA voucher.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.595
- That's right.
- We can't accept it.

26:51.629 --> 26:52.963
Why not?

26:52.997 --> 26:54.865
Then we'd have to accept all VA vouchers.

26:54.899 --> 26:57.768
As long as veterans are
getting the care they need,

26:57.802 --> 26:59.536
I'm not seeing the problem.

26:59.571 --> 27:01.609
The problem's the public hospital system

27:01.610 --> 27:03.244
then has to potentially foot the bill

27:03.279 --> 27:04.445
for thousands of veterans

27:04.480 --> 27:06.314
and the 25% the VA doesn't reimburse.

27:06.348 --> 27:07.916
We have a veteran in the ICU

27:07.950 --> 27:09.417
who needs surgery or he's going to die.

27:09.451 --> 27:11.501
I don't care who I have to call,

27:11.536 --> 27:13.922
but Leon is getting that surgery today.

27:13.956 --> 27:15.823
I understand your intentions, Max,

27:15.858 --> 27:17.258
but this is privatization

27:17.293 --> 27:18.860
and we're playing right into it.

27:18.894 --> 27:21.215
If we approve of Leon's
surgery and we foot the bill,

27:21.249 --> 27:23.798
it sets a dangerous precedent
for the rest of the country.

27:27.469 --> 27:28.703
Either we save Leon

27:28.737 --> 27:30.338
and hurt the care for every other veteran

27:30.372 --> 27:32.440
or we stand up for better care
for all veterans...

27:32.474 --> 27:34.442
And let Leon die.

27:42.651 --> 27:45.620
I respect your wishes, of course.

27:45.654 --> 27:50.224
And I'm aware that this is a
debate in the deaf community,

27:50.259 --> 27:56.325
but removing a implant is...
is a very risky surgery.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.302
"I just want the pain to stop."

28:01.337 --> 28:03.705
I... I want that too.

28:03.739 --> 28:08.242
And... and there are different
types of implants

28:08.277 --> 28:10.297
we can use before we...

28:11.298 --> 28:12.981
"Not that kind of pain.

28:13.383 --> 28:15.719
"The migraines, the dizziness,

28:16.452 --> 28:19.420
"the strange tones, I expected that.

28:19.455 --> 28:21.556
"My friends told me that would come.

28:22.624 --> 28:24.826
"That they all love their implants,

28:26.230 --> 28:28.106
"but I don't.

28:33.195 --> 28:35.003
"I miss who I was.

28:37.365 --> 28:39.466
"How I experienced the world.

28:40.476 --> 28:42.076
"I don't expect you to understand,

28:42.111 --> 28:44.545
"but before the implant, music...

28:47.459 --> 28:49.017
"Was something I felt

28:49.051 --> 28:51.719
"and now it's just weird words

28:52.100 --> 28:54.167
"with weird textures.

28:55.176 --> 28:57.945
"And my thoughts used to be my own,

28:59.093 --> 29:02.262
"and now they're just cluttered
with distractions.

29:04.101 --> 29:06.100
"I thought I was missing something.

29:06.468 --> 29:08.369
"But really...

29:09.644 --> 29:11.311
I'm missing what I had."

29:24.005 --> 29:26.707
"I loved hearing Tori's voice.

29:33.274 --> 29:34.974
"But I heard you better...

29:37.925 --> 29:40.093
When I couldn't hear your voice at all."

29:59.721 --> 30:01.522
Hey, kiddo.

30:01.557 --> 30:04.559
So, um, I really messed up.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.981
Big time.

30:11.467 --> 30:15.636
I forgot to bring the Solo when
I brought the doubles earlier.

30:15.671 --> 30:17.538
I'm a bonehead.

30:17.573 --> 30:19.507
- Yeah.
- Well, that's for you.

30:20.509 --> 30:23.010
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:23.045 --> 30:26.547
So listen, I was thinking
a lot about before

30:26.582 --> 30:28.616
when I came by with Sophia.

30:31.687 --> 30:33.955
You know you can tell me anything, right?

30:38.994 --> 30:41.762
Yeah, that's kind of the problem.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.894
Why is that a problem?

30:53.609 --> 30:56.544
'Cause I've told you everything.

30:58.914 --> 31:01.916
- Yeah.
- You know everything about me.

31:02.594 --> 31:05.987
You know very detail of all of the homes.

31:08.056 --> 31:12.160
All of the bad... the bad stuff.

31:16.598 --> 31:18.266
You know, and now...

31:22.271 --> 31:25.173
When I see you, I just... I feel, like...

31:25.575 --> 31:27.744
like I'm still the same.

31:28.644 --> 31:32.847
Like I'm still broken.

31:34.883 --> 31:37.785
I don't want to be that anymore.

31:51.184 --> 31:54.969
You know, Jemma,
I... I'm so proud of you.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.192
So proud. You've come so far.

32:00.318 --> 32:01.976
Look at you.

32:09.017 --> 32:11.079
You don't need me anymore.

32:11.653 --> 32:14.055
That's... that's a good thing.
That is a...

32:15.023 --> 32:17.058
That's a very good thing.

32:22.664 --> 32:24.599
It's time for me to go. I've got to go.

32:24.633 --> 32:26.968
Um, and that's all right.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.132
Just, uh, just...

32:33.609 --> 32:35.977
Just try to remember one thing for me.

32:37.504 --> 32:39.649
You were never broken.

32:54.896 --> 32:56.597
Richardson.

32:57.899 --> 33:00.968
Blood pressure 100/72.

33:01.003 --> 33:03.037
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

33:03.071 --> 33:05.973
- Suction.
- Suction.

33:06.008 --> 33:08.209
- Lap pad.
- Lap pad.

33:11.046 --> 33:12.880
Blood pressure is dropping.

33:12.914 --> 33:14.815
Uh, lap pad.

33:14.850 --> 33:16.350
Femoral pulse diminished.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.019
Where's all the blood coming from?

33:18.053 --> 33:19.887
Uh, can't see anything.

33:19.921 --> 33:21.822
Gas exchange tanking.

33:21.857 --> 33:24.225
Got it. Free wall rupture.

33:24.259 --> 33:26.727
Right ventricle. Suture, hurry.

33:26.762 --> 33:29.730
So the blood's just pouring
out of her heart?

33:29.765 --> 33:31.332
Yes.

33:31.366 --> 33:33.701
- The surgery was going well.
- I know. Keep sewing.

33:33.735 --> 33:35.303
But why is the wall blown?

33:35.337 --> 33:37.238
I have no idea,
but we have about a minute

33:37.272 --> 33:39.707
to suture it back up, okay? Just focus.

33:39.741 --> 33:41.575
- We've lost carotid pulse.
- Gas exchange tanking.

33:41.610 --> 33:43.077
The brain's not getting any blood.

33:43.111 --> 33:44.745
- She's bleeding out.
- Keep sewing.

33:44.780 --> 33:47.748
Uh, I'm trying but
the sutures keeps pulling out.

33:47.783 --> 33:50.217
The heart muscle's too weak.

33:50.252 --> 33:51.886
Did you get it?

33:51.920 --> 33:53.721
She's cyanotic.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.925
Well, her heart's still in pieces.

34:02.764 --> 34:04.999
There's no more blood to pump.

34:08.303 --> 34:10.204
It's all gone.

34:22.784 --> 34:25.018
You gonna call it?

34:41.235 --> 34:45.272
Time of death 4:16 p.m.

34:55.684 --> 34:57.918
4:16 p.m.

35:35.527 --> 35:38.162
- Hi. Condolences.
- Thank you.

35:53.811 --> 35:56.046
It shouldn't have gone down like that.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.173
She shouldn't have died.

35:59.207 --> 36:03.645
- I know.
- No. You don't.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.780
Marie never should've been out there.

36:13.196 --> 36:15.065
But I had a migraine today.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.076
A stupid migraine.

36:20.745 --> 36:23.547
So she steps up to point
and I stay in the car.

36:30.114 --> 36:32.916
Bring a cop was Marie's whole life.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.420
She didn't have a husband or kids.

36:36.454 --> 36:39.256
We were her family and
that's all that mattered.

36:39.290 --> 36:41.792
Living for this job.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.134
She wanted to be a hero.

36:55.873 --> 36:58.616
And she gets killed at a traffic stop?

36:59.951 --> 37:03.380
She was a hero the moment
she put that shield on.

38:10.682 --> 38:12.616
It's time.

38:18.523 --> 38:20.524
We're not going to stop fighting this.

38:20.558 --> 38:24.194
I promise you, we'll figure it out, Leon.

38:24.228 --> 38:27.264
Leon, this is Angelo Recetti.

38:27.298 --> 38:28.865
Marie's partner.

38:40.044 --> 38:42.079
The guys and I have been talking.

38:44.115 --> 38:47.250
Marie didn't have
any family and we figured...

38:49.253 --> 38:50.687
She'd want the money they would've gotten

38:50.722 --> 38:52.923
from the fallen heroes' fund...

38:54.845 --> 38:57.347
To go to you.

38:58.615 --> 39:01.684
Get you fixed up. This is a start.

39:04.936 --> 39:08.405
- I can't accept that.
- Marie's not here anymore.

39:08.439 --> 39:10.340
But you are.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.244
We want to pay for the surgery.

39:19.443 --> 39:21.577
Why would you do that for me?

39:24.422 --> 39:26.456
We take care of our own.

39:46.644 --> 39:49.988
It'll take a few minutes for
the anesthetic to kick in.

39:50.022 --> 39:52.449
When it does,
I'll bring in the endoscopist.

39:54.218 --> 39:55.485
Okay.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.755
Um, thank you.

40:06.330 --> 40:10.233
It's like nothing ever gets better.

40:11.302 --> 40:17.007
I'm just this broken thing
that nobody wants.

40:17.041 --> 40:19.609
Nobody cares about.

40:19.644 --> 40:21.778
I don't even know why I'm here.

40:36.427 --> 40:39.162
Hey, um...

40:41.365 --> 40:45.009
Sorry, you know you're not
my doctor anymore, right?

40:46.403 --> 40:47.703
Yes.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.569
But I'm still your friend.
