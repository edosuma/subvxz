00:01.669 --> 00:04.194
You're putting a lot of time into
this equestrian show.

00:04.371 --> 00:05.963
I didn't realize its importance.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.735
I'm inviting the Smalls to come watch me
ride in this weekend's competition.

00:09.910 --> 00:13.402
Oh. Well, I take it everything's good
on the father-daughter front.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.106
Actually, they're great.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.747
Well, this could actually work out, then.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.619
Let's just say I'm cautiously optimistic.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.486
I keep living my life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.820
You deserve to be happy.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.130
Thanks, Clark.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.199
Clark, what happened to you?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.567
Story deadline...?

00:39.673 --> 00:44.110
- Stop me when I'm getting warm.
- My article about the debate team. Chloe...

00:44.278 --> 00:46.542
...I'm really sorry.
I got caught up helping Lana.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.773
I'll get it to you first thing tomorrow.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.144
Well, unfortunately, Clark,
I needed it tonight.

00:51.318 --> 00:54.776
To fill in the hole, I had to blow up
the lunch menu to a 60-point type.

00:54.955 --> 00:58.356
- I'm sure that'll be fascinating.
- Chloe, it's my fault.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.983
- I asked Clark to help me.
- No, Lana, I don't blame you.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.162
Well, I'm gonna go lock up in the back.

01:08.335 --> 01:11.327
- Thanks again for your help.
- Yeah.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.205
Chloe, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

01:16.377 --> 01:20.279
I can't say that makes me feel any better,
given your track record on promises.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.515
It's one story, what's the big deal?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.709
That you couldn't give up
one riding practice to do.

01:25.886 --> 01:29.447
- Don't make this about Lana.
- I'm not. This is about you.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.649
And your perennial inability
to be there when I need you.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.989
- Don't you think you're being a little harsh?
- No. I don't.

01:36.463 --> 01:40.524
I'm never a priority in your life, I'm always
just your backup plan and I'm tired of it.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.363
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

01:44.471 --> 01:46.666
If that's the way you feel,
maybe I should quit.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.330
Maybe you should.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.671
Fine. I quit.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074

02:54.508 --> 02:56.499
Help me get this stuff out of the back!

02:56.677 --> 02:58.144
Right.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.020
Hey!

03:08.622 --> 03:11.591
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get out of here!

03:11.759 --> 03:13.192
Hey!

03:27.307 --> 03:28.797
Hurry up, dude. Hurry up.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.273
Okay, let's go. Let's go!

03:34.815 --> 03:36.373
I got it. I got it.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.513
It actually hurt.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.519
- What'd you tell the police?
- I left beforehand.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.420
You witnessed a crime.
You have an obligation to report it.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.528
And put myself back on
Sheriff Adams' radar? I don't think so.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.697
What could I tell her,
I used my x-ray vision to see the plate?

04:59.866 --> 05:03.063
All right, I understand. Just calm down,
what else did you see?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.670
He was wearing a class ring.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.468
I think he goes to Smallville High.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.749
Just because he has a class ring
doesn't necessarily mean he goes here.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.887
I mean, he could be a graduate.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.994
Meanwhile, in Lana-land,
looks like your ship's finally come in.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.926
- Oh, I mean, we're...
- "Just friends."

05:32.098 --> 05:35.499
You better invest in a new set of cue cards.
I've never seen her so happy.

05:35.668 --> 05:40.332
Well, I wish it was just me, but Lana's been
walking on air since her dad stepped up.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.570
Pete, who's that guy?

05:48.748 --> 05:50.147
You mean Eric Marsh?

05:50.316 --> 05:52.784
You really need to pick up a sports page.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.358
All right, Eric, show us what you got.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.601
Let's go, Eric. Step up.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.466
All right, give me some heat.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.172
- Nice swing.
- Yeah.

06:22.348 --> 06:25.511
Eric's got the highest batting average
in Smallville High history.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.846
He really put the team on the map.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.980
Rumor has it they're getting sponsorship
for equipment and uniforms because of him.

06:32.158 --> 06:36.185
Not to mention the scouts that have
suddenly added a detour to Smallville.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.353
Funny thing, though...

06:38.698 --> 06:40.632
...he used to suck.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.358
What do you mean?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.333
We played on the same
Little League team for five years.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.837
He was always a benchwarmer.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.804
When did he go from zero to hero?

06:50.510 --> 06:51.807
Not sure.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.378
Sometimes you work hard enough,
you get your dream.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.209
Or he's under some
pharmaceutical enhancement.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.314
You thinking steroids?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.412
Right now, I don't know what to think.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.912
Lex.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.381
It's been too long.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.192
And I thought we agreed to keep
face-to-face contact to a minimum.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.853
For business, perhaps. This is a social call.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.398
I've come to offer my congratulations
on your engagement.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.036
Though I admit, I...

07:51.204 --> 07:53.968
It hurt that I had to learn
of your pending nuptials...

07:54.140 --> 07:57.439
...via the gossip pages of the Inquisitor.

07:57.677 --> 07:58.905
Come on, Dad.

07:59.078 --> 08:03.538
Since when has my personal happiness
ever been of the slightest interest to you?

08:04.617 --> 08:06.448
And where is...

08:07.086 --> 08:09.646
- Helen?
...Helen.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.847
Helen's out of town at a medical seminar.

08:13.026 --> 08:17.395
I suspect your visit would be putting her
anger management techniques to the test.

08:19.265 --> 08:23.634
But then we both know you're not here
to discuss my wedding plans.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.335
Oh, what is this?

08:27.740 --> 08:30.709
Oh, Lex, I'm surprised that you would...

08:30.877 --> 08:33.846
...put stock in the reportage
of a high-school newspaper.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.575
I usually don't...

08:36.749 --> 08:40.480
...but I did some checking of my own
and Io and behold, it's true.

08:41.287 --> 08:44.450
What are you moving in the middle
of the night in unmarked trucks?

08:44.724 --> 08:46.157
Nothing out of the ordinary.

08:49.162 --> 08:53.826
I'd hate to think that you'd stoop to use
common thuggery to get back at me, son.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.668
Wait a minute.

08:58.171 --> 09:02.164
Are you insinuating that I had something
to do with robbing your truck?

09:02.508 --> 09:04.066
Dad.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.471
That would be illegal.

09:05.645 --> 09:09.445
Legalities are inconsequential.
I would want my property returned.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.777
For what it's worth...

09:13.953 --> 09:18.754
...I had nothing to do with it. But the fact
that you came this far to ask intrigues me.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.922
What's in there that's so important to you?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.737
Give my regards to...

09:34.641 --> 09:36.199
...your fiancee.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.813
Enjoy.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.815
Henry. This is a surprise.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.513
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

09:51.691 --> 09:55.457
Regular coffee, no additives. And when
you come by three times a week...

09:55.628 --> 09:57.095
...you don't need the excuse.

09:58.297 --> 10:02.028
I guess some small part of me
is still getting used to all this.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.398
What, dropping by for a casual visit
with your daughter?

10:05.571 --> 10:11.066
No, entering a business co-owned
by Luthor without an injunction in my hand.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.777
Thanks. But it's been worth it.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.712
I feel the same way.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.387
- What's this?
- The seating chart for this weekend's show.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.252
They set aside a section
for riders' families.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.725
I took a leap and reserved
a couple of seats for you and Jennifer.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.060
Lana, that was thoughtful.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.858
Yes, I'll definitely be there.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.065
But Jennifer won't.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.732
She's never really accepted me, has she?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.504
She just doesn't know you like I do.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.769
Give her some time, she'll come around.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.344
Pete, check this out.
Before Eric's sudden sports career...

10:56.522 --> 10:59.855
...he was an honors chemistry student
with a straight-A average.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.123
Guess you don't get the babes
and the free Nikes for that.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.628
It says here he was in
a chemistry lab explosion...

11:05.798 --> 11:08.733
...at Kansas State University
last summer during chemistry camp.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.631
That's probably why
he's got the plate in his head.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.830
Yeah, but what's he doing
knocking over a LuthorCorp truck?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.173
I thought you quit the Torch.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.901
Just clearing out my desk.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.069
Wait a minute, you quit?

11:21.581 --> 11:23.674
Apparently I can't be counted on.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.215
I didn't even know quitting was an option.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.717
Funny.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.225
Tough crowd.
Hey, I'll catch up with you later.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.826
- Keep me posted on Eric.
- Yeah.

11:40.566 --> 11:43.057
Marsh? Why are you guys interested in him?

11:43.402 --> 11:44.892
Doesn't matter.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.105
Clark, I didn't ask you to quit the Torch.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.640
Yeah, but all I do is disappoint you.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.038
I didn't say that.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.841
I just said it seems like you drop everything
for Lana with no regard for anyone else.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.846
I thought this wasn't about Lana.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.610
It's not.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.720
- It's not.
- Every time you see us together...

12:03.890 --> 12:06.654
...you look at me like I'm cheating on you.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.858
I'm sorry, but if that's the way you feel...

12:10.029 --> 12:11.929
...maybe we shouldn't hang out anymore.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.566
Tell me it's working, boys.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.475
This stuff's incredible.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.134
Another score
and we'll take it out on the street.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.645
Yep, as long as there's enough for me.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.442
I got a major league scout
coming to watch me next week.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.382
Then you can make the next batch, champ.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.725
- Who do we have here?
- Hold him.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.052
You're not going anywhere.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.896
Were you following me, Kent?

13:56.302 --> 13:57.997
I know you robbed that truck.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.971
You're pretty smart.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.612
But you see, I'm smart too.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.219
I finally found a way
to have everything I wanted...

14:20.793 --> 14:22.454
...and nobody is gonna mess that up.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.197
You don't know what you're doing.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.359
Looks like you know about the meteor rock.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.506
It's dangerous. I've seen
what it can do to people.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.768
Like get me a multimillion-dollar
contract in the majors?

14:39.946 --> 14:41.470
He knows too much.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.744
All right, get up.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.919
If he goes, our problem goes with him.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.864
We don't know who else he told.
Let's pack up and get out of here.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.379
Let's go, man. Put this in the back.

15:51.718 --> 15:55.620
- Clark. Oh, my God, what happened?
- I saw one of the hijackers.

15:55.889 --> 15:59.882
He goes to our school. I followed him
to the old foundry. They jumped me.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.028
Clark, you still couldn't stop them?

16:02.195 --> 16:04.993
No, I think it has to do with
refined kryptonite.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.430
They had kryptonite bars,
the same ones that were in Lionel's safe.

16:08.602 --> 16:10.729
That's what they stole from the truck.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.967
Clark, what would they be doing
with kryptonite?

16:14.141 --> 16:18.271
Melting it down and inhaling it. That's
what's giving them incredible strength.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.970
- Jonathan, we have to bring in the police.
- Yeah.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.173
- The police can't do anything.
- Clark.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.252
Dad, they threw me into a blast furnace.
They overpowered me.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.447
If there was kryptonite in there,
I wouldn't be here now.

16:31.358 --> 16:35.055
We can't let our concern
about your secret intimidate us into silence.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.959
Maybe there is another way.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.364
Marsh, drop the bat.

16:44.538 --> 16:48.372
- What is this?
- I don't wanna tell you again. Drop the bat.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.136
You're under arrest
for assault and armed robbery.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.678
- What are you talking about?
- We got a tip, looked through your locker.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.372
You can't without a warrant.

16:56.550 --> 17:00.316
Guess again. We don't need a warrant
to look through a student's locker.

17:00.487 --> 17:06.016
The driver, he came to long enough to tell
us about the aliens that trashed his truck.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.788
Don't worry, now.
You can use your one call to phone home.

17:16.069 --> 17:20.869
Okay, the only time you're ever this quiet
is when you're sleeping. What's up?

17:21.208 --> 17:26.441
Clark and I decided to put our friendship
on an indefinite hiatus.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.216
Over one newspaper story?

17:33.120 --> 17:36.453
Let's just say that
certain insurmountable forces...

17:36.623 --> 17:39.183
...finally made us raise the white flag.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.623
I'm sorry. If there's anything
I can do to help...

17:53.073 --> 17:54.597
Who is that?

17:54.941 --> 17:56.738
Jennifer Small.

18:14.628 --> 18:16.186
Thanks.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.765
- Mrs. Small.
- It's not what you think, Lana.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.501
I don't know what you mean.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.530
I am not cheating on my husband.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.865
I know that's what you thought.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.443
But the man you saw me with was just...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.910
...an old friend of mine from college.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.878
Why are you telling me this?

18:37.050 --> 18:41.146
- I wasn't gonna say anything to Henry.
- He also happens to be my divorce attorney.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.413
Divorce?

18:44.291 --> 18:46.088
Henry never mentioned anything.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.595
That's because he doesn't know.
At least, not yet.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.429
Why are you divorcing him?

18:56.403 --> 19:00.840
Lana, I've learned to handle
a lot in this marriage...

19:01.007 --> 19:04.670
...but that's because through it all,
I knew I was Henry's priority.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.903
Since he met you...

19:07.514 --> 19:09.675
...I am not sure that's true anymore.

19:12.319 --> 19:16.085
- I never meant to come between you.
- But you did.

19:17.057 --> 19:19.617
Lana, you are all he talks about.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.689
You're a window to a happier time.

19:24.698 --> 19:29.192
I guess I am telling you this
because I'm admitting defeat.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.030
You win.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.208
Mrs. Small, I don't want to win.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.042
Goodbye, Lana.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.542
- So much for an interview.
- I admire your dedication.

20:19.386 --> 20:25.382
Though I suspect the hospital
might not be quite so understanding.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.186
Mr. Luthor.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.657
What are you doing here?

20:29.996 --> 20:33.432
Paying a bedside visit to a loyal employee.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.191
It's Miss Sullivan, isn't it?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.437
You know who I am?

20:38.605 --> 20:41.540
I've followed your work
at the Torch for some time.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.769
Given today's front-page scoop,
I assume you came...

20:46.179 --> 20:49.205
...hoping Mr. O'Connor would confirm...

20:50.050 --> 20:52.746
...his connection with LuthorCorp.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.018
I think you just did that for him.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.920
It was never a secret.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.165
Unlike the now-missing
contents of your truck.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.876
On or off the record?

21:21.614 --> 21:25.380
The police report says robbery,
but no one's been able to find anything.

21:25.552 --> 21:28.885
We were moving some industrial material.
It's nothing important.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.523
Somebody sure went to
a lot of trouble to get to it.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.023
Oh, it's a competitive world, you know that.

21:34.194 --> 21:38.790
Corporate sabotage is just
one of the costs of doing business.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.867
- Mr. Luthor...
- Miss Sullivan, I admire your zeal...

21:43.036 --> 21:45.470
...and your work at the Torch
is exemplary...

21:45.638 --> 21:47.629
...but trust me.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.935
You're looking for a mystery
where there's none to be found.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.019
Clark.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.525
Are you okay?

22:06.693 --> 22:11.062
I got blind-sided yesterday by a couple
of guys. Guess I'm still a little shaken up.

22:11.231 --> 22:12.960
What happened, did you get hurt?

22:13.133 --> 22:17.627
I'll survive. It was more of a wrong place,
wrong time kind of thing.

22:18.371 --> 22:22.705
I know the feeling,
at least metaphorically speaking.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.502
I ran into Jennifer Small today.

22:27.213 --> 22:30.376
Found out that she's filing
for divorce from Henry...

22:30.550 --> 22:31.949
...and I'm the reason.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.511
That's intense.

22:35.889 --> 22:39.825
- Have you talked to Henry about it?
- What can I do without making it worse?

22:40.560 --> 22:45.020
He should know what's going on, there
might be a chance to salvage his marriage.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.866
Sounds like you should be
taking your own advice.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.663
I hear you and Chloe are calling it quits.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.505
That's different.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.040
- Why?
- I can't just sit here...

22:57.210 --> 23:00.907
...and watch Chloe get hurt over and over
when I can't do anything about it.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.342
What's so bad that's come
between you two like this?

23:08.421 --> 23:10.013
Well...

23:10.490 --> 23:12.151
I wish I could make it go away.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.457
- You can't.
- You and Chloe have been friends forever.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.361
You can't just let that go without a fight.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.337
At least the Clark Kent I know wouldn't.

23:46.493 --> 23:49.462
If your father sent you,
I had nothing to do with the robbery.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.961
No, no, my father doesn't know I'm here.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.622
I'm sure his representatives
will be around, though.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.860
No, I came to talk about your future.

23:57.370 --> 24:01.306
- What do you care?
- I checked into your baseball career.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.136
I understand there's interest
from some big league scouts.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.073
Yeah, there's more than just interest.

24:06.246 --> 24:09.113
All right?
There's college reps, there's agents.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.740
This is just a bump in the road.

24:11.918 --> 24:16.412
Two felony charges with bail set
at a quarter of a million dollars.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.083
I'd say more like a brick wall,
wouldn't you?

24:19.259 --> 24:21.727
- Why, do I look scared?
- You look guilty.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.995
And if a jury agrees, you can kiss
all that talent and promise goodbye.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.297
Like I told the cops, I didn't do it.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.742
Well, I guess you have
nothing to worry about.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.812
But if the charges stick...

24:42.749 --> 24:44.239
...you might need a friend.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.088
All right, what is it that you want?

24:53.860 --> 24:57.557
I want to know what you stole
out of my father's truck.

24:59.732 --> 25:03.930
Well, assuming that I even have a clue
what you're talking about...

25:06.272 --> 25:08.467
...what's in it for me?

25:26.993 --> 25:28.688
Chloe, what happened?

25:28.962 --> 25:30.190
Go away, Clark.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.462
Are you okay?

25:32.899 --> 25:34.423
Physically, yeah, I'm fine.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.535
Emotionally...

25:37.370 --> 25:39.167
...what do you care?

25:39.339 --> 25:40.567
I want to help.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.304
We'll get the Torch back on its feet.

25:44.477 --> 25:47.241
There is no "we" anymore, Clark.
There's only me.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.010
And this paper was my whole life.

25:50.516 --> 25:54.384
It was the one place I could come to when
everyone and everything let me down...

25:54.554 --> 25:56.522
...and now I don't even have that anymore.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.453
- Where are you going?
- To find a friend.

26:04.497 --> 26:05.725
Chloe.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.061
Hey, Kent, I heard the paper's
not gonna press.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.302
Did you do this?

26:12.405 --> 26:16.899
I don't know how the hell you got out
of that fire, but you'd better back off.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.343
What are you doing out of jail?

26:19.512 --> 26:23.004
Seems I've got friends in higher places
that I didn't even know about...

26:23.182 --> 26:25.082
...and suddenly you're not so anonymous.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.276
I'll testify to put you away.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.284
Oh, no, I'd think about that, Kent.

26:29.455 --> 26:32.288
I know you're unbreakable,
but people that you care about...

26:32.458 --> 26:34.619
...aren't. I'd sure hate to think...

26:34.794 --> 26:37.558
...something happened
to those wholesome parents of yours.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.405
Clark.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.307
Clark.

26:51.511 --> 26:53.240
Your mother.

27:03.223 --> 27:04.713
How's Mom doing?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.282
She's got some...

27:07.461 --> 27:11.056
...minor cuts and bruises.
I still want to get her checked out.

27:11.231 --> 27:14.564
This pregnancy doesn't need
any more complications.

27:16.369 --> 27:17.666
I should've been there, Dad.

27:17.838 --> 27:19.863
- You couldn't have done anything.
- Still.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.338
I'm not gonna let you
beat yourself up about this.

27:22.509 --> 27:24.807
What happens if they come back?

27:24.978 --> 27:27.572
You and Mom should go away,
until this settles down.

27:27.748 --> 27:31.946
I have never run away from a single thing
in my life and I'm not about to start now.

27:32.119 --> 27:34.246
Look around,
look what they did to this place.

27:34.421 --> 27:35.854
You said I can't protect you.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.217
You have to think about Mom,
about the baby.

27:38.391 --> 27:41.360
I am thinking about Mom,
I am thinking about the baby.

27:41.528 --> 27:43.291
I'm also thinking about you.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.493
Dad, please.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.062
Please.

27:56.076 --> 27:58.442
I'll take your mother to a doctor
in Metropolis...

27:58.612 --> 28:01.274
...and maybe stay with your grandfather
for a couple days.

28:03.817 --> 28:07.480
Son, I'd feel a whole hell of a lot better
if you'd agree to come with us.

28:10.290 --> 28:11.757
I can't.

28:15.162 --> 28:17.596
I'm not gonna stand here
and ask you to do nothing...

28:17.764 --> 28:20.631
...because you and I both know
that I would not do nothing.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.434
But I want you to
remember something, son.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.595
They have your strength...

28:26.773 --> 28:29.708
...but they don't have
any of your other abilities.

28:30.811 --> 28:33.302
You make sure you give yourself
a fighting chance.

28:48.261 --> 28:50.126
- Lex.
- I gotta let you go.

28:50.297 --> 28:52.697
I just found out that you visited
Eric Marsh in jail.

28:52.866 --> 28:54.800
Were you the one to bail him out?

28:54.968 --> 28:57.061
I wasn't aware my visit
was public knowledge.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.898
What's Marsh have to do with you?

28:59.072 --> 29:02.098
I was the one who phoned
in the anonymous tip.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.434
Him and his buddies nearly
killed my parents yesterday.

29:05.612 --> 29:09.844
- Are they all right?
- They're in Metropolis, it's not safe at home.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.578
I heard your father's back.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.743
- If this is some sick game between you...
- It's no game.

29:15.155 --> 29:19.387
Clark, that truck was carrying a load
of highly refined meteor rocks.

29:19.559 --> 29:24.019
If I'm not mistaken, I think my father's
resumed his Level 3 experiments.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.927
What does that have to do with Marsh?

29:27.100 --> 29:29.568
Look, I bailed him out,
hoping he'd provide answers.

29:29.736 --> 29:31.863
Maybe he'd lead me to the meteor rock.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.562
Where is he?

29:33.874 --> 29:35.307
I don't know.

29:35.475 --> 29:38.672
He beat up a security guard I had on him.

29:39.379 --> 29:41.711
There's gotta be a way to draw him out.

29:42.282 --> 29:44.978
Clark, I don't have anything Marsh wants.

29:46.887 --> 29:49.048
Except for the meteor rocks.

29:50.490 --> 29:54.392
Marsh has a connection inside LuthorCorp
that tells him when the shipments go out.

29:54.561 --> 29:57.359
If he thinks your father's bringing
another load out...

29:57.530 --> 30:00.897
I still have contacts at my father's firm.
They could let the word out.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.764
The truck will be empty when Marsh hits.
My security team will be all over them.

30:04.938 --> 30:07.907
I've seen what Eric can do.
You have to get the police on this.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.666
Just go home, Clark.

30:09.843 --> 30:13.301
I don't want you or your parents involved
any more than they already are.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.982
Once Marsh and his friends have the truck,
give them a lot of room.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.854
Nobody does anything
until they lead us to the meteor rock.

30:28.061 --> 30:30.291
We're set, Mr. Luthor.

30:31.698 --> 30:33.427
The truck's getting ready to move.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.727
Wait for my signal
before you start following.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.802
Nobody moves without my direct order...

30:50.250 --> 30:51.911
Change of plans.

30:55.622 --> 30:58.989
Okay, I've got the van.
Get ready to make the switch.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.711
Anybody follow you?

31:22.415 --> 31:26.351
I didn't see anyone, but we'd better hurry.
Luthor's bound to have it bugged.

32:13.534 --> 32:15.627
How's it feel, Clark?

32:44.097 --> 32:46.258
Eric, don't do this.

32:48.535 --> 32:50.765
You don't understand, Kent.

32:51.305 --> 32:52.966
It's done.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.539
That's all of it.

33:30.210 --> 33:32.041
At least for now.

33:42.456 --> 33:43.889
Hey, Lex.

33:44.324 --> 33:46.622
Clark, how are your parents doing?

33:46.793 --> 33:49.762
Just fine. They got home
from Metropolis last night.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.921
- That must be a relief.
- Yeah.

33:52.099 --> 33:55.125
Eric's arrested, so it looks like
your plan came off without a hitch.

33:55.302 --> 33:56.860
So it seems.

33:57.037 --> 34:00.268
The intriguing thing is,
my people had nothing to do with it.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.672
- Then who did?
- No one knows.

34:03.844 --> 34:06.108
Marsh and his friends aren't talking...

34:06.280 --> 34:10.774
...but they were found unconscious and
the meteor rocks are still unaccounted for.

34:10.951 --> 34:12.942
Who do you think has them?

34:14.821 --> 34:17.085
I have my suspicions.

34:23.897 --> 34:25.295
Lana.

34:25.465 --> 34:28.263
- Hey.
- Hey, Henry. Thanks for coming.

34:28.435 --> 34:31.029
Your message said something
regarding the horse show.

34:31.204 --> 34:33.069
I hope you're still planning to ride.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.538
To be honest, I'm not sure.

34:35.708 --> 34:39.304
I don't understand, I thought you were
really looking forward to this weekend.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.447
I was. Believe me.

34:44.784 --> 34:48.744
But I think it's more important
that you spend this time with Jennifer.

34:50.791 --> 34:55.728
Lana, she told me you two talked.
If this is because of something she said...

34:55.896 --> 35:01.562
No, I came into your life out of nowhere
and dropped a bomb on your family.

35:02.302 --> 35:07.035
I didn't know how our relationship was
going to work out, but after a rocky start...

35:08.175 --> 35:10.973
...I finally know that you love me.

35:13.513 --> 35:15.913
I don't want to lose that.

35:18.619 --> 35:22.680
I don't know what Jennifer told you,
but things between us aren't that bad.

35:25.759 --> 35:27.693
Henry, she's hiring an attorney.

35:31.164 --> 35:32.426
What?

35:34.234 --> 35:38.000
You need to talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

35:39.873 --> 35:42.706
Whatever happens after that is up to you.

35:47.714 --> 35:52.117
You're my daughter,
I just can't walk away from that.

35:52.586 --> 35:55.919
You're not.
I'll always be here.

36:00.193 --> 36:03.560
But right now,
I think Jennifer needs you more.

36:30.657 --> 36:32.750
Hey, Dad, how's Mom?

36:32.926 --> 36:37.363
You'll be happy to know that both
mother and child got a clean bill of health.

36:37.531 --> 36:40.967
- Good.
- Look, son, I wanted to tell you...

36:42.769 --> 36:44.396
Hi, Lana.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.504
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

36:48.675 --> 36:50.267
- Miss Lang.
- Mr. Kent.

36:50.644 --> 36:53.169
You must be here for Donatello.
I'll saddle him up.

36:53.346 --> 36:55.940
No, I'm not practicing, Clark.

36:56.116 --> 36:58.516
In fact, I think I might
drop out of the show.

36:59.252 --> 37:01.584
I take it things with Henry didn't go so well.

37:02.022 --> 37:04.286
I told him I'd always be his daughter...

37:04.458 --> 37:09.486
...but we should put our relationship on
hold until his marriage gets back on track.

37:10.297 --> 37:12.663
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.201
How are things with Chloe?

37:17.637 --> 37:21.266
I went to go talk to her but this whole
Torch thing put her over the edge.

37:21.441 --> 37:23.807
She told me to go away.

37:24.711 --> 37:26.975
You two will work through this, Clark.

37:28.682 --> 37:30.240
I hope so.

37:30.751 --> 37:33.914
- I miss her already.
- I know what you mean.

37:34.087 --> 37:36.351
I think we should remain
cautiously optimistic...

37:36.523 --> 37:38.957
...that each of us will get a second chance.

37:41.161 --> 37:43.823
You know who's really the loser in all this?

37:43.997 --> 37:45.464
Donatello.

37:45.732 --> 37:48.826
Poor horse worked so hard
and now he can't even strut his stuff.

37:51.905 --> 37:53.896
I guess I can't disappoint him.

37:54.574 --> 37:58.738
Besides, I wanted to share this
with someone special and I still am.

38:01.982 --> 38:04.280
You're still going, aren't you, Clark?

38:08.455 --> 38:10.514
You can count on me.

38:20.767 --> 38:22.496
Miss Sullivan.

38:23.603 --> 38:27.095
- Mr. Luthor.
- Your principal told me you might be here.

38:27.274 --> 38:29.538
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

38:29.709 --> 38:32.701
No. No, I mean...

38:33.513 --> 38:36.949
...I've never entertained a billionaire before.

38:37.951 --> 38:39.885
You'll have to excuse the destruction.

38:40.053 --> 38:43.511
- I was recently vandalized.
- So I heard.

38:43.690 --> 38:46.989
By the same men
who hijacked my truck, I think.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.821
Actually there's still a question.

38:48.995 --> 38:53.125
Eric Marsh owned up to the robbery
of the truck and the assault...

38:53.300 --> 38:56.463
...but he said he didn't have
anything to do with the Torch.

38:56.636 --> 38:59.969
I mean, why confess
to the heavy crimes and deny that?

39:00.140 --> 39:04.634
Well, it's not easy
to understand the criminal mind.

39:05.679 --> 39:07.510
What's this?

39:14.888 --> 39:17.755
This is an interesting display.

39:17.924 --> 39:19.585
I call it the Wall of Weird.

39:21.728 --> 39:25.129
I'll come to the point, Miss Sullivan.
I'd like to help you rebuild.

39:25.498 --> 39:29.594
I've instructed the LuthorCorp foundation
to make a donation to your school...

39:29.769 --> 39:32.499
...the fund specifically
earmarked toward rebuilding...

39:32.672 --> 39:36.335
...and updating the journalism department.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.936
Mr. Luthor, I'm confused.

39:42.682 --> 39:46.880
I mean, the struggling editor in me
wants to just leave it at "thank you"...

39:47.053 --> 39:49.419
...but the journalist in me has to ask, why?

39:50.090 --> 39:52.354
I'm impressed with your...

39:52.826 --> 39:57.763
...willingness to explore
alternative ideas, options.

39:58.698 --> 40:01.792
You interned at the Daily Planet
this summer, didn't you?

40:01.968 --> 40:03.265
Yeah.

40:03.436 --> 40:05.233
I have a little influence there.

40:05.405 --> 40:08.431
They certainly could use some new blood.

40:09.376 --> 40:11.173
Maybe...

40:12.412 --> 40:14.141
...a column...

40:16.149 --> 40:19.016
...to introduce your unique point of view.

40:24.157 --> 40:27.524
I don't want to look a gift horse
in the mouth...

40:27.894 --> 40:32.024
...but I don't understand why the most
powerful man in this city is helping me.

40:32.198 --> 40:35.690
We're after the same thing, Miss Sullivan.
The truth.

40:37.470 --> 40:41.839
You know, journalists are
the midwives of history.

40:42.242 --> 40:45.575
Perhaps with my help, we could...

40:48.181 --> 40:50.445
...make history together.
