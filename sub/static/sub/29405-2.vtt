WEBVTT

00:14.920 --> 00:16.830
Whoa!

00:23.170 --> 00:24.520
- Mmm.
- Good?

00:24.520 --> 00:26.100
Uh-huh.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.360
I'm so proud of you
right now, I could not

00:31.360 --> 00:32.689
be more proud of you!

00:32.700 --> 00:35.100
Come on, we're so close! So close!

00:38.370 --> 00:41.690
You did it! Come on, high five!

00:41.690 --> 00:44.580
Ohh!

00:47.230 --> 00:50.210
And we have a winner!

00:58.560 --> 01:00.370
Buck!

01:04.019 --> 01:05.670
He was passing out those fliers

01:05.670 --> 01:06.590
and he just collapsed.

01:06.590 --> 01:07.920
Let's get his pulse.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.900
- Buck!
- I've got oxygen.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.420
Starting compressions.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.810
Full compressions.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.480
Buck!

01:17.480 --> 01:19.060
Ventricular defibrillation.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.440
- Shock needed. Clear!
- Clear.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.160
There we go. Normal sinus rhythm.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.130
All right.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.330
Ever think about what you
wanna do with your life?

01:35.330 --> 01:37.780
What you wanna be when you grow up?

01:37.790 --> 01:41.120
Astronaut or a pirate.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.620
Some good choices.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.620
Cool outfits, too.

01:45.630 --> 01:49.550
No, wait. A firefighter.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.940
Yeah, me too.

01:58.110 --> 02:02.280
Can you just hold steady
for more than three seconds?

02:02.290 --> 02:05.940
- How's the sketch?
- Will you just hold it steady?

02:05.940 --> 02:07.100
Sheesh.

02:07.110 --> 02:08.770
Hey, Reggie!

02:08.770 --> 02:11.170
Fun police, 2:00.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.130
Morning, Commodore.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.710
No flying drones on the
pier. We've talked about this.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.710
Actually, what you said was

02:18.710 --> 02:21.860
no unauthorized drone
flying on the pier.

02:21.860 --> 02:25.380
But you're the Harbormaster.
You could authorize it.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.470
Or I can call a cop.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.040
But we're making art!

02:28.040 --> 02:30.500
Would you have called
a cop on Michelangelo

02:30.500 --> 02:33.140
for scribbling on the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?

02:33.150 --> 02:36.510
If he were in violation of
seventeen FAA regulations, yes.

02:36.510 --> 02:38.970
Better do as he says, Charlie.

02:38.970 --> 02:40.400
Your last warning.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.990
Better not catch you doing it again.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.230
Sorry, Reggie. Did you
at least get it sketched?

02:49.240 --> 02:51.490
- Enough to get me started.
- Okay.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.820
Well, I need to get home anyway

02:53.820 --> 02:56.030
before my dad finds
out I swiped his drone.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.820
- Thursday?
- I'll be here.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.340
Too close.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.790
Charmed Life, Charmed Life,
this is the Harbormaster.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.600
Come in.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.510
Charmed Life, be advised,
you are too close to the pier.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.720
It'll be an adventure.

03:24.730 --> 03:25.930
It'll be a disaster.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.540
Mom, have you taken a look at this boat?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.350
It looks like you'll
barely make it to Catalina,

03:29.350 --> 03:30.710
much less around the world.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.450
Part of the adventure.

03:33.450 --> 03:35.900
Oh, I've waited for this my whole life.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.190
Out on the open ocean,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.210
just going wherever the waves take us.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.720
Wherever the waves take you.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.450
See, that's not a plan, Chuck.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.750
It's called life perspective, kid.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.730
It's something you're
too young to have yet.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.770
Where does my mother fit
into this... life perspective?

03:49.770 --> 03:53.060
Ah, she's right at the heart of it.

03:53.060 --> 03:57.550
Are you ready, my
love? Padre is waiting.

03:57.550 --> 04:00.050
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

04:00.050 --> 04:02.260
to join these beautiful souls.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.130
Where did all the water go?

04:54.290 --> 04:55.250
Oh, my God.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.980
Into the cabin, now!

04:59.460 --> 05:00.610
Go! Go!

05:02.210 --> 05:03.280
Run!

05:03.280 --> 05:05.990
Run, run! Go!

05:05.990 --> 05:07.540
Get off the pier!

05:07.550 --> 05:09.830
Everyone, high ground!
Incoming flood, let's go!

05:09.830 --> 05:11.500
- Move, move, move!
- Let's go!

05:19.090 --> 05:21.050
Get off the pier!

05:23.230 --> 05:24.390
Here.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.710
Where did all the water come from?

06:22.620 --> 06:25.570
Christopher!

06:25.570 --> 06:29.460
Christopher! Christopher!

06:29.460 --> 06:34.410
- Christopher! Christopher!
- Buck! Buck!

06:34.410 --> 06:36.630
- Buck!
- Chris! Chris!

06:36.630 --> 06:39.580
Chris, just... just
stay there! I'm coming.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.410
Ah.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.750
Just hang on.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.200
Grab my hand! Christopher, reach out.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.160
Grab my hand! No, Chris!

07:04.160 --> 07:06.110
Chris! Chris!

07:06.110 --> 07:08.260
Christopher! Stay over there!

07:08.260 --> 07:10.780
- I can't hold on!
- Just hold on, Christopher!

07:10.790 --> 07:13.760
Buck! Buck!

07:29.640 --> 07:31.090
Right, I got you!

07:31.100 --> 07:34.020
I... I got you, I got you.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.000
_

08:48.360 --> 08:51.530
I'm not gonna lie,
Tammy. I live for this.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.050
Me and my baby girl getting treated

08:53.050 --> 08:55.390
like the queens we are.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.010
I don't lie, either.

08:57.020 --> 09:00.280
I like having two standing
appointments every month.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.110
But I am gonna miss this young lady

09:03.110 --> 09:04.490
when she goes off to college.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.230
Assuming I get accepted somewhere.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.410
Not this again.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.960
I haven't finished any applications.

09:08.970 --> 09:10.070
I still need two letters of rec,

09:10.070 --> 09:11.900
and the U.C. app is a
totally different thing.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.460
And I haven't finished my essay.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.240
Don't worry, baby. We'll...
we'll figure this out.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.250
All these websites
say you're supposed to

09:21.250 --> 09:22.890
write about something important.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.750
Well, what if I haven't
done anything important?

09:24.750 --> 09:27.900
Well, you're 17. No one's expecting you

09:27.900 --> 09:30.010
to write about that
time you cured cancer.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.760
Baby, why are you stressin' about this?

09:34.760 --> 09:35.930
I shouldn't have come today.

09:35.930 --> 09:37.050
You shouldn't have made me.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.480
I should be studying for the ACT.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.150
Well, I thought you could use a break.

09:40.150 --> 09:41.910
- Oh, my God.
- Baby, you got this.

09:41.910 --> 09:45.140
- I know you do.
- No, Mom. I don't.

09:49.410 --> 09:52.590
Any word on how Operation
Buck Up Buck is going?

09:55.950 --> 09:57.450
This was this morning.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.790
"Full stack. Then I think the movies."

09:59.800 --> 10:01.670
- Good luck.
- By now, Chris has come down

10:01.670 --> 10:03.290
from a serious sugar high,
and Buck is regretting

10:03.290 --> 10:04.620
his life choices.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.340
Hey, did someone leave a hydrant open?

10:07.750 --> 10:10.350
I don't think it's a hydrant, Cap.

10:15.610 --> 10:18.450
Baby, are you okay?

10:18.450 --> 10:19.610
I'm okay.

10:22.950 --> 10:25.240
It won't open.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.830
- Where'd you get that?
- Your stepfather.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.380
All right, shield your eyes.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.980
Okay. I am...

10:53.510 --> 10:56.420
LAPD. Everyone okay?

10:56.420 --> 10:58.340
Someone ran the light.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.820
Whoa, look out! Hey, back
up, get away from that.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.310
Everyone, move to the side.

11:05.310 --> 11:08.480
Move to the side! We
have a downed transformer.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.830
Steer clear of it.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.360
Something's wrong.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.490
I'm on with 911, but
they've got me on hold.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.260
It's a tsunami.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.890
Took out the pier.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.490
No, keep going. Keep climbing. That...

11:29.490 --> 11:31.860
We'll send a unit as soon
as we can get into the area,

11:31.870 --> 11:33.670
and it may take a while.

11:33.670 --> 11:35.190
Jonas, how we doing?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.880
Ah, I think I may have gotten myself

11:36.880 --> 11:39.530
- into a situation here.
- No luck with the window?

11:39.530 --> 11:40.940
Went a different direction.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.360
- Up.
- You're in the attic.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.700
Yeah. Wow, there's a
lot of crap up here.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.420
I thought maybe I could
bust open a skylight,

11:49.420 --> 11:51.870
but it turns out, from inside the attic,

11:51.870 --> 11:53.370
it's just a wall.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.070
Okay, well, let's work
with what we've got.

11:56.070 --> 11:59.240
Do you see anything you can
use to break through the roof?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.420
Uh...

12:02.290 --> 12:03.720
Not so much.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.390
Oh, wait a minute!

12:05.390 --> 12:07.410
I forgot I had a pack up here.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.710
- A pack?
- Yeah, climbing gear.

12:09.710 --> 12:12.380
My ex always said I was a gear-hoarder,

12:12.380 --> 12:13.920
She was right.

12:15.060 --> 12:18.140
Thank God she was. Found an axe.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.260
Looks like

12:19.260 --> 12:20.700
I'm chopping through a roof.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.250
I kinda wish I had a bigger axe.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.890
Or, better idea: look for a roof vent.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.060
Attics need ventilation

12:27.060 --> 12:28.670
and the structure will be weaker there.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.970
How'd you know that?

12:29.970 --> 12:33.100
Believe it or not, we
have protocols for this.

12:33.110 --> 12:35.820
Talking someone through how
to break through the roof.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.280
Didn't know I'd be needing it today,

12:37.280 --> 12:38.780
but glad I have it.

12:38.780 --> 12:40.950
Me too!

12:40.950 --> 12:43.000
Ohh, all right.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.650
- Found a vent!
- Okay, focus on the edges

12:45.650 --> 12:47.360
where the vent is
attached to the sheathing.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.760
Don't try to muscle your
way through the middle of it.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.290
Swift Water Command,

12:51.290 --> 12:52.200
this is dispatch.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.570
Checking on request for Code Three

12:53.570 --> 12:55.340
at 801 North Tenth Street.

12:55.350 --> 12:57.010
Delayed.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.940
Boats haven't been able
to get that far west yet.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.920
Too many Code Threes in the water.

13:00.930 --> 13:05.300
Jonas, talk to me. Any progress?

13:10.950 --> 13:12.190
It broke.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.150
I'm not getting out of here.

13:14.150 --> 13:15.360
No, no, no.

13:15.370 --> 13:18.940
We are gonna keep fighting Me and you.

13:18.940 --> 13:22.780
I've summited six of the
world's highest peaks.

13:22.780 --> 13:24.990
I can't make it to the
roof of my own house.

13:24.990 --> 13:27.480
I'm gonna die in this stupid attic.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.850
Come on, you must have had
some pretty crazy adventures.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.050
You survived them.

13:31.050 --> 13:33.880
I almost didn't once.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.550
K2 is a savage beast.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.500
Horrible, unpredictable weather.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.890
We were near the summit
when the avalanche hit.

13:41.890 --> 13:45.320
I got separated from the others.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.640
I thought I was gonna die alone.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.570
Well, you're not alone.

13:50.570 --> 13:53.180
I'm here, Jonas. I'm with you.

13:53.190 --> 13:56.160
It was so cold, but bright.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.240
The way the sun was
bouncing off the snow,

13:58.240 --> 14:00.150
it didn't make any sense.

14:00.150 --> 14:03.250
Dying, surrounded by all that sunshine.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.860
But you didn't die that day.

14:06.870 --> 14:09.340
They found my line.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.160
They pulled me out.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.420
You ever make it to the summit?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.920
Oh, yeah.

14:15.930 --> 14:19.520
It was like...

14:19.520 --> 14:21.100
looking down on the sky

14:23.510 --> 14:25.320
It was so beautiful.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.820
Ah...

14:30.880 --> 14:32.230
Jonas?

14:42.490 --> 14:44.050
Jonas.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.560
911.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.420
What's your emergency?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.940
One wave did all of this?

15:28.170 --> 15:30.740
We already had two so far.

15:30.740 --> 15:34.000
Expect another four or five
before it starts to recede.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.600
We're commandeering
everything that'll float

15:35.600 --> 15:36.670
to supplement our Zodiacs.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.110
I heard there were four firehouses

15:38.110 --> 15:40.460
- in the path of this thing.
- Yeah, they've all checked in.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.600
Except for the 136.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.460
They were responding
to a call at the pier

15:44.460 --> 15:46.650
when the surge hit, so...

15:46.660 --> 15:48.130
if you see any blue out there...

15:48.130 --> 15:49.360
We'll holler.

15:53.810 --> 15:58.480
You good, Chris?

15:58.480 --> 16:02.360
Yep. I took surfing lessons.

16:02.370 --> 16:05.370
Oh, well, maybe you can teach me.

16:08.110 --> 16:10.080
All right, I'm gonna take a look around

16:10.080 --> 16:11.630
and see what I see.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.660
I guess we're gonna have to
hang out here a little longer.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.670
We have a firetruck.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.290
Yeah, we do.

16:22.290 --> 16:24.960
Help!

16:24.960 --> 16:26.630
Help me!

16:28.320 --> 16:30.730
Help!

16:30.730 --> 16:32.150
I'll help! Yeah!

16:32.150 --> 16:33.970
I... I'm gonna come for you!

16:33.970 --> 16:35.180
- Help!
- Okay, okay.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.400
Chris, um, I...

16:37.400 --> 16:40.160
I need you to sit right here for me.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.810
- You promise me?
- Yeah.

16:41.810 --> 16:44.360
- Okay, right here. Right here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.690
Help! Help!

16:52.200 --> 16:54.670
Help! Help me!

16:57.700 --> 16:59.140
Help!

17:00.680 --> 17:01.850
Here I am!

17:03.760 --> 17:05.310
Hurry up!

17:09.050 --> 17:11.859
- Hurry up!
- Help, I can't get out.

17:11.859 --> 17:14.339
I can't get out.

17:14.349 --> 17:17.030
I... I'll help you. I will come back.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.280
Okay, I promise you.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.369
Help!

17:36.240 --> 17:37.680
Help!

17:38.580 --> 17:40.080
Help!

17:40.080 --> 17:43.710
Hey! Hey, you can let go!

17:43.710 --> 17:46.880
Okay? I need you to let go.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.420
You can do it!

17:51.780 --> 17:53.470
Okay, you're doing great.

17:57.390 --> 17:58.810
You're doing great!

18:12.070 --> 18:14.160
Gimme that hand.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.240
Okay, okay, okay.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.580
You're doing so great.
You're doing so great.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.100
Just climb up. You're okay. You got it.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.460
Buck. People.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.650
Please!

18:34.110 --> 18:37.590
- Help! Help!
- Somebody...

18:37.600 --> 18:39.520
- Will you watch him?
- Okay.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.120
- Yeah?
- Help!

18:46.530 --> 18:48.620
Help!

18:48.620 --> 18:51.440
Help us, please!

18:51.440 --> 18:53.420
Help us! Please help!

19:06.050 --> 19:08.860
No. The line's still open.

19:08.870 --> 19:11.460
Protocol says we do not hang up.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.670
Not until help arrives or they're safe.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.440
You said he was in a flooding car.

19:16.810 --> 19:19.970
It's been over 20 minutes
since he said anything, Linda.

19:19.970 --> 19:23.320
The line's still open.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.990
I... I can't...

19:28.690 --> 19:31.520
It's okay. Go take a break.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.700
I never thought I'd see
you disconnect a call.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.580
Water-resistant phones.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.160
They can keep working for 30 minutes

19:42.160 --> 19:43.660
after being submerged.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.830
Ain't technology great?

19:45.830 --> 19:47.850
How are you holding up?

19:47.850 --> 19:50.660
I have both feet on
dry land. I'll be okay.

19:50.660 --> 19:54.260
Good. This day's not over.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.710
- Okay, what can I do.
- You used to run

19:55.720 --> 19:57.550
an emergency room, right?

19:57.550 --> 19:59.430
Well, that's what this is.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.640
I need you on the floor
with me doing triage.

20:01.650 --> 20:04.940
Okay, but we have a system in
place to prioritize the calls.

20:04.940 --> 20:09.610
Well, not the calls, I
need you to triage them.

20:09.610 --> 20:11.540
Make sure they're doing okay.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.180
Identify where we can help

20:13.190 --> 20:15.210
and be brutal about where we can't.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.570
Be the bad guy if you have to.

20:17.570 --> 20:19.210
Like you just did with Linda.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.740
Today's gonna take a toll...

20:23.740 --> 20:25.790
on all of us.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.420
Okay, let's work fast,
people, in between waves.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.830
Help!

20:52.490 --> 20:53.660
Please!

20:54.770 --> 20:56.900
Help!

20:56.900 --> 20:58.490
- Cap!
- I see it, Chim.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.440
Help!

21:02.450 --> 21:04.390
- Get into my arms.
- Don't move, sir.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.740
We'll be right there.

21:05.740 --> 21:08.790
Be careful, guys. Unstable.

21:08.790 --> 21:12.190
And my sons are inside. Please hurry!

21:14.520 --> 21:16.270
I'll check you out, sir.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.190
- I'm suck.
- Gentlemen, can you hear me?

21:27.190 --> 21:28.360
Yes!

21:29.690 --> 21:31.100
All right.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.270
Antenna from the radio
station pierced the hull.

21:33.270 --> 21:36.150
Then it pierced them.

21:36.150 --> 21:38.960
They're skewered together
from the shoulder...

21:38.960 --> 21:40.960
through the abdomen...

21:42.040 --> 21:44.370
to the bottom of the boat.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.470
And this boat is taking on water.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.780
We need a plan, Cap,
and we need it fast.

21:55.950 --> 21:57.700
Normally, we'd travel them both

21:57.700 --> 21:59.960
with object intact, and
let the ER sort it out.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.150
Except for this case, the object

22:01.150 --> 22:02.800
is a radio station antenna and a boat.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.470
We need to separate
them. Can we do that?

22:04.470 --> 22:06.300
It seems to have missed
the kid's heart and lungs.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.880
I'm not sure about the stepdad.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.450
He's got about a half dozen
vital organs it could've hit,

22:10.450 --> 22:13.210
So as long as we keep
both pieces in them, maybe.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.690
That's not a no.

22:15.690 --> 22:19.570
- Adele, please.
- No, I'm not leaving you...

22:19.580 --> 22:21.580
- either of you.
- Whatever happened

22:21.580 --> 22:24.090
to love, honor and obey?

22:24.910 --> 22:27.360
I never said "obey."

22:27.370 --> 22:30.010
We didn't even finish the ceremony.

22:30.010 --> 22:32.420
It's okay, Mom. Please, just go.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.540
He's right, ma'am. Best thing to do now

22:34.540 --> 22:36.220
is just let us work.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.850
I love you both so much.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.430
I got you, I got you.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.710
Let's get you to the boat.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.880
Okay, we have a plan.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.280
Only one plan... you save this kid.

22:48.290 --> 22:51.180
What? No, Chuck, you're
already insufferable.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.690
Don't be insufferable and magnanimous.

22:52.690 --> 22:54.020
I can't take it.

22:54.020 --> 22:57.060
She is the love of my life.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.110
He is the love of hers.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.880
Save... save him.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.070
Our job is to save you both,
so that's what we're gonna do.

23:06.070 --> 23:08.120
- Cover 'em up, Eddie.
- Got you.

23:11.790 --> 23:12.910
All right.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.300
Eddie, Hen, I need you to lift him up.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.970
And Jason, if you can
get on your knees at all,

23:17.970 --> 23:19.750
I need you to try, okay?

23:19.750 --> 23:20.920
Careful, it's gonna hurt.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.920
Turn your head away.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.030
Oh!

23:31.570 --> 23:33.100
- Okay.
- Let's get him up.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.960
Jason. Oh, shh, it's all right.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.440
What about Chuck?

23:46.450 --> 23:48.280
Abdomen's distended and warm.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.610
I'm pretty sure his spleen's ruptured.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.280
He'll probably lose too much blood

23:52.280 --> 23:53.930
if we pull him off this.

23:53.930 --> 23:56.120
We'll have to cut from underneath.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.390
Underneath what?

24:01.090 --> 24:03.090
Always did love Jacques
Cousteau as a kid.

24:03.090 --> 24:04.800
You and me, both.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.450
Cap's in the water.

24:17.770 --> 24:19.530
Chimney, you seeing this?

24:25.110 --> 24:26.790
We got another surge!

24:32.130 --> 24:33.470
This is a problem.

24:38.130 --> 24:40.890
Hey, you said you were a cop.
Why can't you take a report?

24:40.890 --> 24:42.830
Sir, do I look like I'm on duty?

24:42.830 --> 24:45.500
Well, can you get
someone down here who is?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.350
Her insurance needs to pay for this.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.250
- What are you talking about?
- You rear-ended me!

24:49.250 --> 24:51.730
- It's a pile-up!
- People, people!

24:51.730 --> 24:54.340
There's some real
trouble down by the beach.

24:54.350 --> 24:57.010
Y'all waiting for help to
come? It's already here.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.900
And it's us.

24:58.900 --> 25:02.660
Check in with your neighbor.
See if anyone needs help.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.740
We're all we've got right now.

25:17.020 --> 25:19.110
Hey.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.420
- Oh, thank God.
- What's your name?

25:21.420 --> 25:22.870
- Vicky.
- All right, Vicky,

25:22.880 --> 25:24.830
- can you move?
- Yeah.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.840
Just not out of here.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.340
My leg is pinned, and I
don't know how much longer

25:29.340 --> 25:32.010
I can keep the pressure on this.

25:32.010 --> 25:33.270
Okay, okay.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.720
The blood's not pumping
out of the wound.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.350
I think that's a good thing.

25:37.350 --> 25:38.850
Just hold it there another second.

25:41.390 --> 25:43.020
May!

25:43.020 --> 25:44.520
Come on, I need your help!

25:47.570 --> 25:48.780
Come here.

25:48.790 --> 25:50.450
I need you to put pressure on this

25:50.450 --> 25:52.070
while I go get the first aid kit.

25:52.070 --> 25:55.530
- Mom, I... I...
- Just for a minute.

25:55.530 --> 25:57.030
Okay.

25:57.030 --> 25:59.410
May. May! Look at me.

25:59.410 --> 26:01.390
Now is not the time for
you to be frightened.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.370
So put your hand here and hold it.

26:03.370 --> 26:04.720
Come on.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.230
Not too much pressure. Okay.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.730
I'll be right back.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.840
Your name's May?

26:36.740 --> 26:40.330
- I'm Vicky.
- Hi.

26:40.340 --> 26:44.960
Did I hear someone say
there was a tsunami, or...

26:44.960 --> 26:46.790
am I dreaming?

26:46.790 --> 26:51.960
- There was.
- Wow.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.460
Sewer's backing up.

26:53.470 --> 26:55.070
It's just spillover.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.450
I want that report!

27:04.450 --> 27:06.050
- Officer!
- Sir!

27:06.060 --> 27:07.530
Officer!

27:12.840 --> 27:15.440
- ...unusual, right?
- Oh, God!

27:15.450 --> 27:17.630
Oh, my God. Mom!

27:17.630 --> 27:19.630
Mom!

27:19.630 --> 27:22.470
May! May! No, stop!

27:22.470 --> 27:25.640
Go back into that van until
I tell you to come out.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.220
Do you hear me?

27:34.340 --> 27:35.840
Oh, God.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.560
Vicky, come on.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.060
- Okay.
- I'm really sorry about this.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.320
You're fine. You're gonna be fine.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.580
Water's coming faster, Cap!

27:54.580 --> 27:55.950
Copy that, Eddie.

27:55.950 --> 27:58.280
I'll bang three times on
the hull when it's done.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.950
Chuck? Can you hear me?

28:02.920 --> 28:05.980
He's not breathing.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.350
How's his pulse?

28:07.350 --> 28:09.520
We gotta do CPR underwater.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.670
- CPR underwater?
- We can't do compressions

28:11.670 --> 28:13.540
- unless he's flat.
- How's he gonna get air?

28:13.550 --> 28:14.850
He's not breathing anyway.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.260
It's just to keep him from drowning.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.840
At least for a minute.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.860
There's a scuba mask over there.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.190
Grab it, put it on him.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.560
Three, two, one.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.690
You got him?

28:40.860 --> 28:42.240
Nothing.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.230
Nothing.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.720
Nothing.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.990
Eddie, antenna is clear.

29:16.730 --> 29:18.380
I got a pulse!

29:18.380 --> 29:19.590
Free the mask.

29:25.740 --> 29:27.590
There we go. Welcome back, Chuck.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.960
Oh, hell of a save, Hen. Hell of a save.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.770
I can't believe it worked.

29:33.770 --> 29:36.010
Bring in that backboard!

29:36.010 --> 29:37.800
Can't believe it worked.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.520
- Ready? One, two three.
- If you read, 118,

29:41.520 --> 29:42.760
we need backup at the Santa Monica Pier.

29:42.760 --> 29:43.970
Good job down there, guys.

29:43.970 --> 29:46.640
- Thanks.
- Copy that. Cap!

29:46.640 --> 29:49.140
The man is asking for available
hands down at the Pier.

29:49.150 --> 29:53.120
Okay, Chim, Hen, you
transport the patients.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.790
- Copy that.
- Eddie, you're with me.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.100
- Copy that.
- We'll regroup

29:56.110 --> 29:57.290
at the staging area.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.290
I got 911, finally.

30:10.290 --> 30:12.880
This is Athena Grant, LAPD.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.020
I'm at the intersection
of Brockton and Wilshire

30:15.020 --> 30:18.810
There's a multi-car pile-up
with serious injuries.

30:18.810 --> 30:21.670
We got water in the street
and a downed transformer.

30:21.670 --> 30:24.640
I need a DWP crew right now!

30:24.640 --> 30:26.530
All DWP crews are engaged.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.500
The power's not out
in your area, Sergeant.

30:28.510 --> 30:32.230
I know the power is not
out. That's the damn problem.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.020
I got folks out here
dying in the street.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.330
Nearest DWP crew is
at Rose and Granville.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.860
They can be there within the hour.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.330
That's not gonna work.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.530
We got a woman bleeding out here.

30:46.820 --> 30:49.700
No, no, no. Don't lie down.
No, no, don't lie down.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.090
Come on.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.590
Stay on hold.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.260
Who are you calling?

30:55.260 --> 30:56.330
- Jacobs.
- Yeah?

30:56.330 --> 30:57.500
This is Athena.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.710
I need you to find me a black and white.

30:59.710 --> 31:03.360
The closest thing you
got to Rose and Granville.

31:04.010 --> 31:07.720
May. It's okay.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.940
No, no! But... No, you have to sit up.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.210
There was less blood
when you were sitting up.

31:15.210 --> 31:17.390
- Come on.
- It's okay.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.230
Stop saying that!

31:19.230 --> 31:20.950
It's not okay. It's not.

31:20.950 --> 31:22.730
Help is coming. My mom's out there.

31:22.730 --> 31:24.290
She'll figure something out.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.660
Just keep your head up. Come on.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.320
- Keep my head up.
- Keep your head up.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.040
- Yeah.
- Come on, Vicky, you can.

31:34.040 --> 31:37.720
Okay, you're gonna stay awake,
and you're gonna stay alive.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.080
- I need to rest.
- I don't give a damn.

31:40.090 --> 31:42.640
I'm sure there are people who love you,

31:42.640 --> 31:45.260
who expect you to make it home to them.

31:45.260 --> 31:47.670
Okay, no offense, but I
never wanna have to meet them

31:47.680 --> 31:50.220
and tell them how you died in my arms.

31:50.220 --> 31:52.260
I'm 17 years old.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.450
You're not gonna traumatize
me like that, got it?

31:56.770 --> 32:00.200
Nobody in this car's dying. Not today.

32:00.990 --> 32:05.210
You're one tough cookie, you know that?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.100
You got someone trapped in a car?

32:13.100 --> 32:15.550
Yeah, two. I got two someones.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.170
We're clear.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.570
May, I'm here.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.440
I tried to keep her awake.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.480
I really tried, Mom.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.380
Come on.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.990
Come on.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.980
Stretcher coming through.

33:17.190 --> 33:21.290
We've got a pulse.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.340
Okay, let's go, let's go.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.500
She's alive.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.990
Yes, baby. She was alive

33:33.990 --> 33:37.640
because you kept her alive.

33:37.650 --> 33:42.200
Hey, hey. Hey! Who...

33:42.200 --> 33:44.540
I was so scared.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.210
Of course you were.

33:46.210 --> 33:49.520
But you did good. Just
like I knew you would.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.190
I'm not you, Mom.

33:52.510 --> 33:56.200
Well, I wasn't always me, either.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.850
It took me a minute to get here.

33:58.850 --> 34:00.870
You'll get there.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.020
Hey, you doing okay?

34:14.020 --> 34:15.550
Yep, still people out
there who need our help,

34:15.560 --> 34:17.850
- so that's what I'm gonna do.
- I think Ann needs a break.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.409
Code Three. Tension pneumo.

34:20.409 --> 34:21.989
I sent the ambulance
to St. Mary's in Culver,

34:21.989 --> 34:23.610
but they're telling
me they're tapped out.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.920
Okay, and the three closest
hospitals are flooded.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.210
- What about UCLA?
- They just asked me

34:27.210 --> 34:29.230
- to reroute three calls.
- Playa Vista's gonna be

34:29.230 --> 34:31.969
your best bet.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.900
Hi, Chimney. You guys okay?

34:33.900 --> 34:35.570
Yeah, we're all fine, but
I'm hoping you can help me

34:35.570 --> 34:36.810
cut through some red tape.

34:36.810 --> 34:38.389
We keep pulling Level
Ones out of the water

34:38.389 --> 34:39.810
and we have no place to send 'em.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.150
We're sending victims to
every dry hospital we can find.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.560
We have a system in place.

34:43.560 --> 34:44.929
Well, whoever's in charge of that system

34:44.940 --> 34:47.100
is doing a terrible job.

34:47.110 --> 34:48.230
That would be me.

34:49.730 --> 34:50.949
A terribly good job

34:50.949 --> 34:53.489
under extremely difficult circumstances.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
So, what, the hospitals
recall all their staff?

34:55.500 --> 34:58.090
It's not about staff. They
are flooded with staff.

34:58.090 --> 35:00.130
It's about beds and space.

35:01.410 --> 35:04.120
What we need is a field hospital.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.790
A triage, closer to the water.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.840
Stabilize and move 'em
inland as beds open up.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.460
Wait. The VA hospital on Sawtelle,

35:11.460 --> 35:12.750
it's not far from where you are now

35:12.760 --> 35:13.920
and it's out of the flood zone.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.470
Why aren't we sending
patients there now?

35:15.470 --> 35:17.680
Because it was
decommissioned two months ago.

35:17.690 --> 35:19.090
It'll be totally empty.

35:19.090 --> 35:21.280
- Right.
- Right.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.780
See, I told you you
were doing a great job.

35:23.780 --> 35:26.290
Uh-huh. I'll talk to Sue and
see if we can make this happen.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.810
Okay, sounds good. Oh...

35:28.810 --> 35:30.140
one other thing, how are you?

35:32.480 --> 35:34.650
Honestly?

35:34.650 --> 35:37.040
Happy to hear your voice.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.320
And weirdly grateful

35:39.320 --> 35:41.320
that my brother has a
serious blood clot condition

35:41.330 --> 35:42.950
and is nowhere near this nightmare.

35:42.950 --> 35:45.500
Is that wrong?

35:45.500 --> 35:47.100
Not at all.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.480
Okay, I spy, with my little eye,

35:51.480 --> 35:57.220
something that... moves people around.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.980
Um...

36:00.230 --> 36:02.730
Oh. A scooter.

36:02.730 --> 36:05.160
Ah, yeah. Nice one.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.750
Okay, genius. Your turn.

36:12.360 --> 36:16.340
I spy a shopping cart.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.170
What? No, come on.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.530
Hey, that's not how the game works.

36:19.530 --> 36:20.840
You can't just yell stuff out.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.390
But yelling stuff out is the fun part!

36:28.710 --> 36:30.180
You amaze me, buddy.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.520
- Why?
- I got some bad news

36:33.520 --> 36:35.100
at work the other day,

36:35.100 --> 36:37.690
and I didn't wanna get out of bed

36:37.690 --> 36:39.270
for a whole week.

36:39.270 --> 36:43.550
But you, after the day you had,

36:43.560 --> 36:46.890
here you are, with a
big smile, bustin' a gut.

36:49.190 --> 36:52.540
You never gave up.

36:52.540 --> 36:56.420
Even when that water was
rushing over you back there.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.450
You just kept on swimming.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.570
Like Dory.

37:03.570 --> 37:05.050
Yeah, like Dory.

37:05.050 --> 37:08.200
And not just today.
You know, but every day.

37:08.210 --> 37:11.410
You never say no, you never complain.

37:11.420 --> 37:12.870
How... how do you do that?

37:12.880 --> 37:16.140
Well, I complained
once, but it didn't work.

37:16.140 --> 37:17.920
So what did you do?

37:17.920 --> 37:20.090
Just kept on swimming.

37:20.090 --> 37:21.690
Like Dory.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.300
Oh, my God, look over there. Oh.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.150
Oh, my god.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.320
Oh, no.

37:33.580 --> 37:39.440
I... I spy, with my little eye,

37:39.440 --> 37:42.090
something that is high.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.040
A street sign?

37:44.040 --> 37:47.590
Uh, high... higher
than that. Like, whoa...

37:57.090 --> 37:59.440
Maddie, I just got off the
phone with the Deputy Mayor

37:59.440 --> 38:01.090
and State Emergency Services.

38:01.090 --> 38:03.120
Everybody's on board with
the VA field hospital.

38:03.130 --> 38:04.520
When will it be operational?

38:04.520 --> 38:06.950
Well... thank you. Let's see,

38:06.950 --> 38:09.310
generators and cots
are being sent over now.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.670
And they said that we can start
routing patients in an hour.

38:11.670 --> 38:12.930
That's great.

38:12.940 --> 38:16.030
Oh, can you call
ME-Coroner and Red Cross?

38:16.030 --> 38:19.030
Tell them bodybags need
to be sent to the VA.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.390
5,000 to start.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.660
- You see this, Cap?
- Kinda hard not to, Eddie.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.550
Jesus Christ.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.870
- Wait, who's up there?
- La bombera.

39:02.870 --> 39:05.090
Hey, we could use a hand up here.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.050
Fire lady.

39:14.350 --> 39:16.680
I don't know what I'm
gonna tell your father.

39:16.680 --> 39:21.090
You know, I take you
out one time and, uh...

39:21.100 --> 39:22.770
look what happens.

39:25.190 --> 39:26.780
You saved me.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.400
And you saved them.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.540
No, we did that together.

39:37.540 --> 39:41.060
Me and you make a great team.

39:41.070 --> 39:44.170
Give me a high five.
I'm proud of you. Really.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.210
- Thank you, Buck.
- Thank you.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.090
We're getting reports of another surge

39:54.100 --> 39:57.390
- Our correspondent...
- Oh, my God. Not another wave.

39:57.390 --> 40:01.600
No, same wave. It's going
in the other direction.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.900
Back out to sea.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.760
This isn't over.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.610
- No, no, no!
- Kevin!

40:30.170 --> 40:31.610
Incoming! Debris!

40:33.910 --> 40:36.580
Hey, everybody get down!

40:36.580 --> 40:39.790
Get down and hold on! Hold on!

40:43.940 --> 40:45.520
Help!

40:47.850 --> 40:50.090
Please!

40:50.090 --> 40:52.140
Please help!

40:58.690 --> 41:02.890
Hold on!

41:02.890 --> 41:04.290
Ah!

41:09.280 --> 41:11.370
Ah, ah, Christopher!

41:11.370 --> 41:13.160
Christopher!

41:13.160 --> 41:16.010
No!

41:21.210 --> 41:24.710
Christopher! Christopher!
