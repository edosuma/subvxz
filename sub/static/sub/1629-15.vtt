NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:03.087 --> 00:04.122
MARY: Who were you back in our land?

00:04.255 --> 00:05.244
I was a midwife.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.670
Maybe you could give me some advice?

00:06.757 --> 00:08.258
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.331
You can call me Zelena.

00:09.427 --> 00:11.884
How many people do we know
who can spin straw into gold?

00:12.096 --> 00:13.211
EMMA: Rumplestiltskin.

00:17.602 --> 00:19.012
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:21.022 --> 00:23.684
GRAN NY: If you want privacy, talk fast.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.733
We open in 20, and no one
gets between Leroy and his bacon.

00:28.905 --> 00:30.270
Is there any sign of our quarry?

00:30.364 --> 00:33.356
I went all over that farmhouse
and the land around it. Nothing.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.440
Well, now that the sun's up,

00:34.577 --> 00:36.033
we should hit every place
Gold might go.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.781
His house, shop, his cabin.

00:37.914 --> 00:39.700
'Cause dead men love vacation homes.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.042
Can someone explain to me
how this is even possible?

00:42.126 --> 00:43.457
We all saw Gold. He...

00:43.544 --> 00:45.125
Disappeared into nothingness. I know.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.623
I might have an inkling.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.334
When we went back
to the enchanted forest,

00:49.467 --> 00:52.504
Neal was talking about
the possibility of getting his father back.

00:52.637 --> 00:53.752
What? How?

00:53.846 --> 00:55.177
He didn't know how. He just...

00:57.141 --> 00:58.256
He missed his family.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.475
And he was desperate
to find a way to return to this world.

01:01.604 --> 01:05.062
He believed that
bringing his father back was the key.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.515
Well, if that was his plan,
then obviously something went wrong.

01:07.610 --> 01:10.397
Because, while Gold might be
alive and kicking, Neal is...

01:10.863 --> 01:12.023
He's...

01:12.156 --> 01:13.396
We don't know what he is.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.402
We don't even know
if he made it back to Storybrooke.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.949
No one's seen him since this new curse!

01:17.036 --> 01:18.071
He's out there, somewhere.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.618
With all due respect,

01:19.705 --> 01:22.538
we have bigger issues right now
than who brought Gold back.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.124
The fact that he was in
the Wicked Witch's basement, for one.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.043
I wanna know what the hell
she was cooking up with him.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.208
Well, the best way to find that out
would be to ask Gold, right?

01:30.341 --> 01:32.707
He could tell us who the Witch is,
maybe how to track her down.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.004
I'm gonna head back to that farmhouse.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.093
It's possible this witch left behind

01:37.181 --> 01:39.888
some trace of potion
or special ingredient.

01:40.393 --> 01:41.553
Have at it. Just be careful.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.053
Well, she's the one
who needs to be careful.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.020
She invaded my space.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.526
And when I return the favor,
I'm not pulling any punches.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.866
l summon thee, Dark One.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.201
Rumplestiltskin!

02:06.210 --> 02:07.620
(SIGHS)

02:07.712 --> 02:09.202
It's not working.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.330
The Dark One has broken free,
and he knows far too much.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.206
(MONKEY SCREECHES)

02:14.385 --> 02:16.250
Find him, beautiful one.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.552
Find him now.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.884
(MONKEY SCREECHES)

02:22.518 --> 02:23.883
(PANTING)

02:48.878 --> 02:51.415
So Rumple's alive?

02:54.050 --> 02:56.666
But how is that even possible?

02:56.761 --> 02:58.717
We were hoping
you might be able to tell us that.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.716
You know him and the shop
better than anyone.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.674
If he's in Storybrooke,
there has to be a clue in here

03:04.769 --> 03:08.136
about how he got back,
or how we can find him, now that he is.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.433
Yeah, I'll start looking right away.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.773
Keep your eyes out for him, too.
If he comes into town, he'll...

03:12.902 --> 03:15.609
He'll come to me. Yeah, I know.

03:19.617 --> 03:20.948
I will stay here with you.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.947
l'm surprisingly good at research.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.492
You will stay with me?

03:27.458 --> 03:28.914
He'll protect you if the Witch comes.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.377
You do know he tried to kill me?

03:30.461 --> 03:32.827
Well, there were
extenuating circumstances.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.294
Twice?

03:35.466 --> 03:36.501
Sorry?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.582
You really know
how to charm a girl, don't you?

03:38.677 --> 03:41.805
This will be my way
of making it up to you.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.508
-Hmm?
-Fine.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.551
All right, we should
really get out into the woods.

03:45.643 --> 03:47.929
Hey, maybe you should stay home.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.887
Me? I'm the best tracker here.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.642
I know. But we'll manage.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.481
Remember what Zelena said.
You need your rest.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.568
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:59.156 --> 04:01.363
Belle, thank you for your help.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.777
And don't worry, we're gonna find him.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.654
Okay. Thank you.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.531
BELLE: If there's anyone
who can defeat that witch

04:10.668 --> 04:13.705
and get you back to your family,
it's the Dark One.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.746
The way to resurrect him has to be here.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.126
You really believe in him, don't you?

04:18.551 --> 04:22.214
I love him. All of him.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.634
Even the parts
that belong to the darkness.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.636
Yeah, it took me a while
to see past all that.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.970
To the good man trying to get out.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.351
He did get out.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.185
Yeah. He did.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.521
Irony is, now I need the dark part

04:42.533 --> 04:45.024
in order to get to the ones I care about.

04:47.872 --> 04:48.907
What is that?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.869
A necklace.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.542
It was Emma's.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.832
It's supposed to represent
our life together.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.920
I don't know how it survived the trip.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.465
Because it was borne out of true love.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.551
Now, come with me.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.050
I think I know
where we can find what we need.

05:14.732 --> 05:15.938
(SIGHS)

05:16.066 --> 05:17.351
You think there's magic in here?

05:17.443 --> 05:19.559
No. Something better than magic.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.810
Books.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.191
Books on history and witchcraft,

05:23.282 --> 05:25.113
and hopefully,
some on the Dark One, too.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.860
Where do we start?

05:28.954 --> 05:30.785
One shelf at a time.

05:31.207 --> 05:33.118
MAN: (IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Hello there.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.038
Did you say some...

05:37.129 --> 05:39.415
MAN: Over here.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.836
Allow me to introduce myself.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.087
What the hell?

05:44.220 --> 05:48.554
No need to be frightened.
I am but a humble servant of this castle.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.469
My name is Lumiere.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.853
Uh, watch the cover on that one.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.477
Dealing with a hook here.

05:59.777 --> 06:00.937
(CRASHING)

06:02.780 --> 06:04.611
lt's him. It's Rumple.

Neal? Neal?

06:28.597 --> 06:29.928
EMMA: Henry.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.552
Mom, were you out all night?
I never heard you come in.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.678
l was working.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.767
But I got you breakfast,
because I am supermom.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.981
Some cocoa and a sesame bagel.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.268
That's a bagel?

06:40.359 --> 06:42.475
Sorry, kid.
We're not in Manhattan anymore.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.608
Are you going back out?

06:46.699 --> 06:50.032
I got to, yeah.
You remember Leroy, right?

06:50.786 --> 06:52.026
He's going fishing
with some buddies today.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.027
-You wanna go?
-Yeah. I'll go.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.488
Because I love fishing.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.001
Not because I believe you.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.290
What?

06:59.378 --> 07:02.962
You know you're not fooling me, right?
Something's up.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.127
I'm working a case.
You know how I get focused.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.176
No, it's more than that. It's this town.

07:09.305 --> 07:10.795
All these old friends
you've never mentioned,

07:10.889 --> 07:14.131
and people whispering around me
all the time.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.050
There's something
that you're not telling me.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.017
It's a dirty business,
being a bail bondsperson.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.478
I don't wanna soil your sweet head.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.648
You're not getting off that easy.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.976
If you can't tell me the truth,
then I wanna go home.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.480
Back to New York.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.028
(CELLPHONE RINGING)

07:31.076 --> 07:32.486
Sorry.

07:32.578 --> 07:35.194
Hello? What?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.329
I'll be right there.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.869
I got to go, Henry.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.709
Mom, really, what's going on?

07:46.008 --> 07:50.047
You got me, okay? Something is up
and itjust got even more complicated.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.795
So, for now, can you just trust
that I'm doing what's best,

07:52.890 --> 07:54.881
and I'll fill you in later?

07:55.392 --> 07:56.507
I trust you.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.934
Thanks, Henry.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.019
Love you.

08:05.069 --> 08:08.061
Neal. You're here. What happened?

08:10.532 --> 08:12.523
I don't know.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.826
I remember seeing
the yellow Bug cross the town line,

08:15.913 --> 08:18.450
and next thing I know, I'm running
around a forest back in Storybrooke,

08:18.582 --> 08:21.619
where, apparently,
there's been a whole lot going on.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.626
Are you gonna tell him, or shall I?

08:25.589 --> 08:26.624
Tell me what?

08:26.757 --> 08:29.590
Neal, we think your dad's back.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.802
Back? ljust watched him die.
What do you mean, he's back?

08:33.931 --> 08:35.262
Take it easy.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.097
What the hell is that?

08:41.271 --> 08:43.057
l have no idea.
It was there when I woke up.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.062
Belle, can you do some more research?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.312
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.730
-l'l| send you the picture.
-Okay.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.780
Hey, guys. Can we have a minute?

08:53.075 --> 08:54.155
Yeah, of course.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.663
It's good to see you.
Even better to have you remember me.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.161
It's good to see you, too.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.288
Has it really been a year?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.964
Yeah.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.337
When can I see Henry?

09:14.847 --> 09:16.087
Neal, I don't...

09:16.181 --> 09:19.093
I know, okay? I know I can'tjust
come barging back into your life.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.970
No, it's not that.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.849
My memories came back, but his...

09:24.982 --> 09:26.472
He doesn't remember anything.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.644
-The curse, his old life...
-Me.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.317
You.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.232
What does he know about his father?

09:33.323 --> 09:35.359
What I knew until about a week ago,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.904
which was that you let me go to jail,
and never came back for us.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.986
Yeah, but I didn't have a choice.
You know that.

09:40.122 --> 09:44.331
Yeah, I do know that now.
But I didn't during that whole year.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.249
So my son has no clue who I really am?

09:46.336 --> 09:48.463
He just thinks
I'm the jerk that abandoned him?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.758
We have to get his memories back.
We have to fix this.

09:51.842 --> 09:55.255
There has to be somebody who can...
The Blue Fairy, or my father, that...

09:55.345 --> 09:56.676
Neal.

09:57.139 --> 10:01.382
He was really happy in New York.
With our life.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.472
You don't want him
to get his memories back?

10:05.731 --> 10:07.687
Maybe that's for the best.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.231
But I'm his father.
I want him to know who I am.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.363
BELLE: I don't understand.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.035
and how have our paths never crossed?

10:22.539 --> 10:27.158
It's a big castle,
and l was woefully under-utilized.

10:27.419 --> 10:31.162
Sadly, I only awaken
when my candles are lit.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.918
Those are the rules of my punishment.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.211
Punishment by who?

10:35.511 --> 10:39.174
Whom do you think?
Does he even know where he is?

10:39.264 --> 10:40.925
Rumplestiltskin, of course.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.095
We made a deal long ago,
and when I couldn't live up to my end,

10:44.228 --> 10:46.844
he made sure I paid the price.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.887
He's not here, is he?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.855
No, he's dead.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.107
We're trying to bring him back.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.189
You said you spent a lot of time here.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.782
Do you know anything that could
restore the Dark One, and...

10:57.908 --> 11:00.365
I know a great many things.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.033
Please! You got to help us.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.118
If you don't,
I'll never see my family again.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.488
Boo-hoo.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.575
Why should I help resurrect the man
who put me in this wax prison?

11:09.711 --> 11:14.045
The Rumplestiltskin you knew
may have seemed cold and hard,

11:14.132 --> 11:15.338
but he's changed since then.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.585
Hmm.

11:16.718 --> 11:21.087
If you help us, I know he would
restore you to your human form.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.468
Please.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.474
The bookcase behind you.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.766
Bottom cabinet.
You shall know it once you see it.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.600
It's a volume befitting the Dark One.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.196
What the hell kind of book is that?

11:44.288 --> 11:47.405
This isn't a book. It's a hiding spot.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.911
-What is this?
-lt's a key.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.331
To the vault of the Dark One.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.337
The vault of the Dark One?

11:59.803 --> 12:02.545
Where the first Dark One was made.

12:02.639 --> 12:06.302
Borne out of the, well, darkness.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.309
If you wish to
bring back Rumplestiltskin to life,

12:09.646 --> 12:11.477
it is where you must go.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.973
Will you guide us on ourjourney?

12:15.444 --> 12:16.479
If your promises

12:16.612 --> 12:20.480
that the Dark One will return me
to my human form are true,

12:21.825 --> 12:23.656
then, yes, lwill.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.828
We leave first thing in the morning.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.057
ZELENA: Nicely done.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.647
I don't think they suspected you
for an instant.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.233
Which says more about them
than it does about you.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.853
That Belle isn't as smart as she thinks.

13:00.989 --> 13:05.107
And that son of his? (CHUCKLES)
Dumber than a box of hair.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.820
They are merely desperate
to bring back their Rumplestiltskin.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.663
Not only desperate. Blind.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.412
Release me. l have aided you enough.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.375
I'd watch your tone, candle.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.999
There's more to be done.
And you shall do it.

13:20.217 --> 13:23.880
Unless you desire being
the wax seal on an envelope.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.596
Whoa! You got here fast.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.057
Well, I could hear
a little panic in your voice.

13:31.603 --> 13:35.095
But I am here to tell you
that there is no need to be anxious

13:35.232 --> 13:37.848
when you haven't felt your baby
move for a while.

13:37.943 --> 13:41.527
It doesn't mean a thing. Here.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.857
-Orange juice?
-Mmm-hmm.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.314
Trust me.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.994
See, babies move less
right before you go into labor.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.164
So it's possible you're closer
to delivering than we think.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.741
-Here.
-Oh, maybe.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.744
Maybe I'm just anxious because of
everything that's going on.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.086
With getting ready for the baby, I mean.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.581
And the Wicked Witch.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.710
Everyone in town's talking about it.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.670
Have you found out
anything more about her?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.847
No. And I'm cooped up here,

14:10.934 --> 14:13.220
while everyone else is out there,
working hard to find her.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.144
Hey, hey.

14:16.273 --> 14:19.936
(CHUCKLING) No one is working
as hard as you are right now.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.394
I mean, you're creating
a whole new person.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.773
(CHUCKUNG)

14:25.073 --> 14:26.108
Now, drink up.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.313
Right.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.330
(GAS PS) Oh, wow.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.203
(CHUCKLES)

14:44.593 --> 14:46.424
Works every time.
(CHUCKLES)

14:46.762 --> 14:47.842
You're amazing!

14:48.138 --> 14:51.756
Your little prince or princess
could be here any day.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.468
I am not letting you have this baby
without me.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.477
(SlGHS)

15:06.865 --> 15:08.025
(TWlG CRACKS)

15:13.330 --> 15:15.366
Show yourself, you winged freak.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.038
(GASPS)

15:18.502 --> 15:19.742
(SlGHS)

15:20.337 --> 15:24.171
Apologies, m'lady.
I thought you were the Wicked Witch.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.962
And I thought you were a flying monkey.

15:29.471 --> 15:33.965
I do hope my mistake hasn't cost me
my head, Your Majesty.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.924
So, you know who I am?

15:36.019 --> 15:39.307
Your reputation in the
enchanted forest precedes you.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.016
I didn't catch your name.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.561
Robin of Locksley, at your service.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.019
The thief?

15:49.241 --> 15:51.482
Well, as we're tossing labels around,

15:51.576 --> 15:54.033
aren't you technically known
as the Evil Queen?

15:55.163 --> 15:56.539
I prefer Regina.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.416
You think you can bring down
the Wicked Witch with sticks?

16:01.545 --> 16:03.752
Well, I'm certainly going to try.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.088
I'm afraid we're too late.
She's long gone.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.260
Well, perhaps she left a trail.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.548
l was hoping the same thing.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.675
Well, then,
you've got yourself a partner.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.432
I don't remember asking for one.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.726
You didn't.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.235
Just don't get in my way.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.774
I wouldn't dream of it.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.945
Have we met before?

16:36.246 --> 16:39.784
I doubt I'd ever forget meeting you.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.331
Unless, of course, it was during
that pesky year no one can recall.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.378
All the more reason to find this witch.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.593
Perhaps she can offer some insight
into our lost memories.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.095
HOOK: Thought you could use
some sustenance.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.558
Nothing like a green blob
to get the appetite going.

17:04.649 --> 17:08.392
Well, I gather
it has great medicinal properties.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.351
They put you on babysitting duty, huh?

17:10.447 --> 17:12.062
What, no one trusted me to stay here?

17:12.157 --> 17:13.442
Emma's simply concerned about you.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.406
She thought it best
you weren't out in the cold,

17:15.493 --> 17:16.903
running after your father.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.202
Thank you, by the way.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.825
For playing nanny?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.452
For getting Emma the message
to come back.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.909
You would've done the same.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.335
Yeah.

17:27.797 --> 17:32.632
What's it feel like to play the hero
after being a pirate for so long?

17:32.761 --> 17:34.467
Unfamiliar.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.632
And you?
How does it feel to play the villain?

17:36.932 --> 17:38.138
I'm a villain now?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.549
Well, if you truly had a hand
in bringing your father back,

17:40.644 --> 17:42.509
I suspect you had to use
the darkest of magic,

17:42.646 --> 17:44.728
and paid an even darker price.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.975
Though I'm sure you felt
the ends justified the means.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.941
(GRUNTS) I should be out
there looking for him.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.316
l have to set things right.
With him and my son.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.981
Question is,
are you gonna stand in my way?

17:57.619 --> 17:59.484
I am in your way.

18:06.962 --> 18:08.168
What the hell are you doing?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.829
Oh, this is long overdue.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.386
Sometimes, when I look at you,
all | see is a man.

18:16.846 --> 18:21.010
I forget that beneath it all,
you're still that boy.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.007
The one I looked after
all those years ago.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.177
I haven't forgotten.

18:26.481 --> 18:31.191
We got caught up in so much nonsense
over a woman.

18:33.863 --> 18:37.071
I need to do this, Killian.
You know that, right?

18:39.244 --> 18:41.701
You have 10 minutes.
Then I alert the others you've gone.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.366
Thank you.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.750
You know, ever since it happened,

18:49.879 --> 18:53.497
I haven't been able to stop thinking
about Rumple's sacrifice.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.584
I mean, how he died,
to save everyone in Storybrooke.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.712
You know that wasn't it.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.510
He died to save us. His family.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.305
At least he died a hero.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.387
Were you surprised he had it in him?

19:08.523 --> 19:11.230
Of course not. Were you?

19:11.359 --> 19:15.602
I don't know. I mean, my papa
was never the most selfless guy.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.320
I know he wished he hadn't let me
go through that portal.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.943
I know how sorry he was,

19:19.075 --> 19:22.533
but now that l have a son of my own,
I can't imagine ever doing what he did.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.699
He regretted what happened with you,
so much.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.915
And he was willing to do anything
to get back to you.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.083
That's one thing about him
I can relate to.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.294
'Cause I would do anything
to get back to Henry.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.415
It's getting colder.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.093
Look.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.480
Come on,
let's get what we came here for.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.106
Let's get my father.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.568
So, how was Neal?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.491
It was hard.
Henry makes it complicated.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.410
lt's notjust about me.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.241
He's hoping Gold
can help bring his memories back.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.372
That would be an added bonus
to finding him.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.498
Would it?

20:14.631 --> 20:17.373
Couple days ago, I would've thought
that was true. But now...

20:17.467 --> 20:20.129
Now what? How is he gonna stay
in Storybrooke without them?

20:24.432 --> 20:26.423
Unless you're not planning to.

20:26.518 --> 20:30.557
You think you'll go back to New York
after we break the curse?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.933
A week ago,
Henry and l were playing video games

20:33.024 --> 20:34.309
and eating Fruit Roll-Ups.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.433
Now, I am chasing after the Dark One,

20:36.528 --> 20:39.190
hoping he can help me find
the Wicked Witch of the West.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.357
(MAN SCREAMING)

20:44.077 --> 20:45.317
(MOANlNG)

20:45.829 --> 20:47.569
Gold! You all right?

20:47.664 --> 20:50.531
No. No, no, no. Not all right, not all right.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.199
I can't quiet the voices.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.494
We know that you were
held captive by the Witch.

20:55.630 --> 20:56.870
Do you know where she is?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.621
Yeah. (PANTlNG) She's...

21:00.802 --> 21:02.508
There's no room! No room.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.548
There's too many voices.
Too many voices!

21:04.681 --> 21:06.387
We've got to get him out of here.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.139
(MONKEY SCREECHES)

21:09.352 --> 21:10.512
(GRUNTS)

21:12.897 --> 21:14.103
(SCREECHES)

21:16.484 --> 21:18.020
-Gold!
-He's getting away!

21:18.945 --> 21:21.527
(GRUNTS) |'|| hold him off. Go!

21:22.866 --> 21:24.026
(GRUNTS)

21:30.874 --> 21:32.660
REGINA: Nothing useful here.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.534
Mmm, unfortunately.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.833
What? So none of these
contain magical properties?

21:38.923 --> 21:41.380
Well, a good witch covers her tracks.

21:41.718 --> 21:46.087
But a better one can uncover them.

21:46.431 --> 21:50.219
We'll find her. Just be patient.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.728
You know,
I've heard many stories about

21:55.899 --> 21:58.231
the great and terrible Evil Queen.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.394
But from this angle,

21:59.527 --> 22:02.735
the "evil" moniker
seems somewhat of an overstatement.

22:03.573 --> 22:08.567
Bold and audacious, perhaps,
but not evil.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.905
The name served me well.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.284
Fear is quite an effective tool.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.764
What about this? Is this magical?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.810
Not exactly.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.430
But it is a liquid
that can conjure courage,

22:39.150 --> 22:42.608
give strength, or even act
as a love potion of sorts.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.947
(CHUCKLES)

22:45.740 --> 22:49.483
It's called whiskey.
And no, it's not magical.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.780
-Especially the next day.
-Oh.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.665
You wanna have a drink? Now?

22:57.835 --> 23:02.750
Well, in the last few days,
we've survived a curse,

23:02.840 --> 23:07.425
woken up in an entirely new realm,
and forgotten a year of our lives.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.134
I'd say we've earned it, wouldn't you?

23:16.479 --> 23:17.434
You need love.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.478
You're gonna help me find
another soul mate?

23:19.816 --> 23:22.649
There he is. The guy with the lion tattoo.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.526
Is something wrong?

23:28.491 --> 23:29.526
Regina!

23:38.459 --> 23:39.869
-Gold?
-Emma?

23:42.463 --> 23:44.203
Neal, what the hell are you doing here?

23:44.674 --> 23:46.665
You expect me to stay in bed
while you're looking for my dad?

23:46.801 --> 23:49.042
-Right, I forgot who I was dealing with.
-You got a bead on him?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.426
David and ljust saw him,
but he took off again.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.505
So it's true? He's alive?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.010
Yeah, he is.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.175
How'd he seem?

23:58.187 --> 24:00.769
I don't know what that witch did to him,
but he seems a little crazy.

24:00.857 --> 24:05.021
When I asked him about her, it was like
he wanted to tell me, but he couldn't.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.060
Well, he can't be far. Come on.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.646
You wanna waste time
dragging me back to the hospital?

24:09.741 --> 24:11.402
'Cause that's the only way
you're gonna get me there.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.525
Fine, let's go.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.081
You found it. Thank heavens.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.339
Now what?

24:25.423 --> 24:27.414
Head to the center of the clearing.

24:27.550 --> 24:31.668
Under the ice and snow, you shall
find the entryway to the vault.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.061
Belle!

24:42.398 --> 24:45.561
Yeah. The key must go in the middle.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.650
You're sure about this?

24:47.737 --> 24:52.231
I spent 200 years
in Rumplestiltskin's library,

24:52.367 --> 24:54.733
witnessing more dark magic and sorcery

24:54.869 --> 24:57.406
than any living creature has ever seen.

24:57.538 --> 25:00.701
I'm sorry,
how long did you say you were there?

25:00.792 --> 25:03.249
Two hundred years, at least.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.285
He's lying.

25:07.632 --> 25:11.966
Rumple built that library for me,
not long before the curse.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.177
It's been there barely 30 years.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.252
Who are you?

25:15.390 --> 25:17.597
Unless you wanna spend the rest

25:17.725 --> 25:19.886
you better start talking.

I am who I appear to be.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.851
Only it wasn't Rumplestiltskin who
turned me into this wretched form.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.934
It was the Wicked Witch of the West.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.985
The Wicked Witch?

25:31.447 --> 25:33.278
She told you to lead us here?

25:33.491 --> 25:36.324
She wants you
to bring back the Dark One,

25:36.452 --> 25:39.068
so she can control him with his dagger.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.572
Okay. We need to leave this place.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.532
Belle, wait.
It means we can bring him back.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.128
Does it matter who got us here?

25:46.254 --> 25:48.745
Rumple didn't sacrifice his life for good,

25:48.840 --> 25:52.674
so he could return to be a slave to evil.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.758
My father is the king of loopholes.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.382
I'm sure he'll figure out
a way to deal with her.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.008
And what if he can't?

25:58.349 --> 26:01.637
Think what she could do
if the Dark One was under her control.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.636
We'll find another way
to bring him back.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.353
What if there is no other way?

26:07.650 --> 26:10.016
I can't waste any more time.
I need to get back.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.693
To hell with the cost.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.990
That's what your father told himself
when he forged the curse

26:18.119 --> 26:21.361
that condemned
countless people to misery!

26:21.497 --> 26:24.159
Don't make the same mistake he made.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.340

He loves pizza.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.225
I meant living there in the city.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.977
Yeah, I did, too.

all the things we normally couldn't.

go to the zoo, just do nothing.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.320
It didn't get lonely? Just the two of you?

27:47.500 --> 27:52.415
Henry had tons of friends
at school, and I had someone.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.537
-Sorry.
-Why are you sorry?

27:54.632 --> 27:59.251
Of course you did. It's not like we were...

A key that opens
the vault to the Dark One.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.570
You did this! You tricked him!

All I did was pass on
some vital information.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.578
With the help of a friend.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.080
And then your son did the rest.

You didn't tell him the price.

I was not completely honest with you
about this case.

41:09.343 --> 41:11.379
This trip.

41:12.012 --> 41:14.503
The reason I brought us here
is because

41:15.766 --> 41:17.848
someone was in trouble,

41:18.060 --> 41:21.552
and the person who needed help
was not a client.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.517
It was your father.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.642
This is about my dad?

41:27.736 --> 41:29.692
Some bad people wanted to hurt him.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.736
Is he okay? Did you find him?

41:32.616 --> 41:33.947
I found him,

41:35.535 --> 41:37.116
but I was too late.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.740
He's gone, Henry.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.372
NOICE BREAKING)
He was a good man.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.542
And he would've been a great father.

41:47.089 --> 41:49.580
There's one thing
I need you to know about him.

41:52.219 --> 41:54.380
He was a hero.

41:54.471 --> 41:55.881
lwish lwould've known him.

41:56.682 --> 41:57.922
(LAUGHS)

41:59.267 --> 42:01.258
You did.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.849
Mom, you're not making
any sense right now.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.601
I know.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.106
And what happened
to the person who did it?

42:17.119 --> 42:19.110
They got away.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.617
But I'm going to find them.
