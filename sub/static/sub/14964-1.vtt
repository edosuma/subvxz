Good morning, Herr Geisler. Good morning,
Margaret. Staying here for Christmas?

04:28.052 --> 04:30.887
No, I'm going to Italy with Lisa
to stay with her family.

04:31.013 --> 04:34.432
That'll be nice. Should be warmer
down there. I sure hope so. Bye!

04:34.559 --> 04:36.143
Good-bye, girls. Have
a good Christmas. Bye!

04:36.227 --> 04:38.061
Thank you. Same to you.

04:57.081 --> 05:00.041
Margaret, for goodness
sake, get a move on. You're late again.

05:00.126 --> 05:02.127
You know how your father is
when it comes to catching trains.

05:02.211 --> 05:04.963
He wants you at the station
a good hour before it leaves.

05:08.134 --> 05:10.510
Here. It's for you.
For me?

05:10.595 --> 05:12.929
Oh, thank you.

05:13.014 --> 05:16.308
And you? Ah.

05:16.434 --> 05:19.603
Thank you, Lisa. Now get your packing
done. What do you think about this tie?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.689
It's a present for my father.

05:22.773 --> 05:25.275
Oh, I'm sure he'll love it.

05:25.401 --> 05:27.110
Oh, it's very pretty, I think.
Oh.

05:27.195 --> 05:29.029
Oh, there's the telephone.

05:29.155 --> 05:31.156
Now do hurry and get your things
ready, won't you, girls. Yes.

05:31.240 --> 05:35.160
Oh, dear. I don't think your mother
likes this tie. I hope my father does.

05:35.244 --> 05:39.080
They'll be leaving at 1:00, and it
gets in tomorrow morning at around 7:30.

05:39.165 --> 05:43.543
Oh, so they're coming down by train?
Isn't that going to be awfully tiring for them?

05:43.628 --> 05:45.545
I mean, they could fly so easily.

05:45.630 --> 05:47.547
I know.
But I'm so scared when they're flying,

05:47.632 --> 05:50.217
And besides,
planes are never on time these days.

05:50.301 --> 05:52.761
Oh, hold on a minute. Good-bye,
Maria. See you after Christmas.

05:52.887 --> 05:55.305
Yes, all right, Mrs. Stradi.
Have a good time. Thank you.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.389
Sorry, dear.

05:56.474 --> 05:58.558
Prepare Giulio.

05:58.643 --> 06:02.687
I've just seen Lisa's present for him
and it's the most terrible tie imaginable.

06:02.772 --> 06:05.857
A real yucky turquoise
with a hand painted design.

06:05.942 --> 06:08.526
Oh, my goodness! Poor Giulio.

06:08.653 --> 06:12.155
I hope he doesn't wear it to the hospital.
Otherwise they'll have him committed as insane.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.324
He's the complete
essence of sobriety.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.118
You'll have to lose it quickly
in a deep drawer.

06:17.203 --> 06:19.746
- Has Lisa been behaving well?
- Oh, of course.

06:19.830 --> 06:23.291
She's always sweet. She's never behaved
badly, not when she's stayed here with us.

06:23.376 --> 06:26.586
She's certainly no angel here with us.

06:26.671 --> 06:28.505
Still, I do miss her.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.507
Give them my love, all right?

06:30.716 --> 06:32.050
Everything ready? Yes, sir.

06:32.134 --> 06:34.678
All right then, let's begin.

06:34.804 --> 06:37.222
Blood pressure and temperature?
Normal, sir.

06:37.306 --> 06:38.974
All right, scalpel.

06:46.107 --> 06:47.774
Swab.

06:47.858 --> 06:49.317
Retractors, nurse.
Keep swabbing!

06:49.402 --> 06:51.236
Another retractor.

06:52.905 --> 06:54.406
Another swab.

06:56.033 --> 06:57.617
Homeostatic pincers.

06:58.661 --> 06:59.828
Suction.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.621
Swab.

07:01.706 --> 07:03.206
Swab.
Keep swabbing!

07:06.752 --> 07:08.003
Daniel.
Yes?

07:08.129 --> 07:11.047
Is this the last?
Yes, we're finished for today.

07:11.841 --> 07:14.217
All right. There.

07:14.302 --> 07:15.802
Close the incision.

07:15.886 --> 07:19.889
As soon as you've finished, have her sent
up to Intensive Care. I'll check later.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.495
Yes?

07:42.580 --> 07:44.622
Telephone for you, sir.

07:44.707 --> 07:46.207
For me?
Yes, sir.

07:47.293 --> 07:49.002
Thanks.
It's your wife.

07:49.086 --> 07:50.462
Ah.

07:52.089 --> 07:53.798
Hello?

07:53.883 --> 07:55.592
Yes, darling,
I've finished just now.

07:55.718 --> 08:01.097
Oh, Doctor. - No, no. I trust your choice.
You don't need help from me for that.

08:01.182 --> 08:02.682
Yes, thank you.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.351
Well, I guess so, yes.

08:05.561 --> 08:08.855
Yes, all right, dear. I'll
come along. I'll meet you there.

08:08.939 --> 08:10.815
About half an hour, I imagine.
All right?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.275
Ciao.

08:13.986 --> 08:18.031
Uh, listen, Pauline, I'm going out now. So if
anybody calls, tell them I'll be back this afternoon.

08:18.115 --> 08:19.616
Right, sir.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.207
Where is everybody? Don't you realize
we're meant to be at the station by now?

08:26.291 --> 08:28.667
Why are you always so nervous
about these things? Calm down, dear.

08:28.752 --> 08:32.004
You know we've never
yet missed a train.

08:32.089 --> 08:33.798
Hurry, girls.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.092
Well, don't blame me
if we miss this one.

08:39.596 --> 08:42.390
Did you get the cigarettes?
Yes, I stole two packs from them.

08:44.810 --> 08:48.687
Hurry up. Come along, girls. Tell me, what
do you find so funny about us being late?

08:48.814 --> 08:52.149
You realize if it wasn't for me you'd never
catch that train for Italy and I-I-I calm down.

08:52.275 --> 08:56.487
Stop it now, Margaret. This is hardly the time for
your silly games, We're late as it is. So stop it.

09:04.246 --> 09:06.580
Good morning, Doctor.
Ciao, Carla.

09:12.337 --> 09:15.214
Shall I prepare for surgery? No, I don't think it's worth it.

09:16.007 --> 09:18.717
What is it? Well, they just brought
in an accident victim, Doctor.

09:18.844 --> 09:22.888
- Poor fellow went under a bus. - I don't think
there's any use operating. He's in a deep coma.

09:22.973 --> 09:26.142
You'd better change your attitude quickly
if you don't want trouble.

09:26.226 --> 09:28.686
Even if the chance is remote,
you must operate, right?

09:28.770 --> 09:31.522
All right, let's go. Call my wife,
please. Tell her I'll be a little late.

09:31.606 --> 09:33.357
Yes, sir.

09:48.165 --> 09:51.459
Are you sure you have everything? Come
along now. We must hurry or you'll miss it.

09:51.543 --> 09:54.086
We're hurrying. We're hurrying.
And they're not going to miss it.

11:04.366 --> 11:06.408
That black coat she's wearing
is worth a few bucks.

11:11.957 --> 11:14.542
Well?
Fair enough.

11:14.626 --> 11:16.043
Filthy rich.

11:24.970 --> 11:26.887
Hey!

11:26.972 --> 11:29.056
Watch this.

11:29.182 --> 11:31.475
Let's go!

11:55.458 --> 11:58.836
Have a wonderful Christmas and give our love
to your parents, Lisa. Yes, do that. Bye-bye.

12:03.383 --> 12:06.385
Hey. Why don't we go for a train ride?
If we hurry, we'll make it.

12:33.246 --> 12:37.207
I'll go and see if I can find
some empty seats. You stay here, all right?

12:37.334 --> 12:40.294
Listen, if you should see Robert-
Very funny.

12:41.379 --> 12:42.880
Excuse me.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.420
Hey, you don't mind my smoking,
do you, lady? No, go ahead.

13:37.602 --> 13:39.520
Allow me.

13:39.604 --> 13:41.230
Here.
Thank you.

13:54.411 --> 13:58.497
I think we'll be better off in
second class. We can disappear here.

13:58.581 --> 14:00.541
Nobody will find us
among this bunch.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.543
I wonder what the jail's like
down in Austria.

14:02.627 --> 14:07.923
What are you talking about, huh? No one's gonna
catch us. Now, quit thinking about jails, huh?

14:08.007 --> 14:10.134
You think?

14:28.278 --> 14:30.195
Eh?

14:31.531 --> 14:34.158
- Nervous tic.
- Ah.

15:04.689 --> 15:07.733
Nothing. They're packed in
like sardines, I'm afraid.

15:07.817 --> 15:09.693
Well, not to worry.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.196
Hey, let's have one of the cigarettes.
Mm-hmm.

15:14.324 --> 15:16.033
Yeah.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.751
I forgot to bring the lighter.

15:30.048 --> 15:31.757
Go ask for a light.
No, you ask.

15:31.883 --> 15:35.093
That fellow over there will give you a light.
Go on. No, I'm shy. Oh, all right, all right.

15:36.054 --> 15:38.972
You look tired, Joe.
Yeah, I'm tired all right,

15:39.057 --> 15:41.683
- for paying for a seat and having to stand.
- Go on.

15:44.479 --> 15:46.897
Uh, do you think I
could have a light? Sure.

15:53.071 --> 15:54.571
Thanks a lot.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.426
Just think, Margaret-

16:56.510 --> 16:59.470
two weeks without having to do
any biology, chemistry or history.

16:59.555 --> 17:05.143
So what? I'd much rather be spending this
time camping or skiing with people our own age.

17:05.227 --> 17:08.563
Yeah. But, Margaret,
Christmas is a family reunion.

17:08.646 --> 17:11.107
Huh. You mean I'm stuck with it
whether I like it or not?

17:11.191 --> 17:14.484
Oh, it won't be so bad.
At least you've got me along.

17:18.198 --> 17:20.532
Hey, tell me what are
the kids like in Italy.

17:20.617 --> 17:25.163
Same as in Germany. They all like
the things that all us kids like.

17:29.668 --> 17:31.586
Well, it's bound to happen sometime.

17:31.670 --> 17:34.839
The thing to decide is,
well, whether it's better now or later.

17:34.924 --> 17:38.092
Yeah, I agree. Though you've really
got to find the right guy first.

17:39.261 --> 17:42.138
By the way, you never did tell
who you did it with first, did you?

17:42.222 --> 17:44.390
You promised, remember?

17:45.184 --> 17:47.226
With that guy in the third row.

17:47.311 --> 17:50.730
With Helmut? The one
with thick glasses and acne?

I must say, I still have reservations
about giving her one of these.

kids have these motorbikes now.

Besides, Lisa's a young lady. I know.

One for my niece.

Oh, that's a very good choice.
It's one of our best models.

The only thing I would suggest is that
it may be better to select another color.

20:12.998 --> 20:18.419
The orange might fade.
I suggest maybe a black or even dark blue.

20:18.504 --> 20:22.090
Black, blue, orange, white.
It really doesn't matter, right, Giulio?

22:18.415 --> 22:20.583
Let's see now-
Where did I put 'em?

22:20.667 --> 22:25.463
Ah, here we are. Four of' em,
right? One, two, three, four.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.841
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

22:28.926 --> 22:30.760
May I have your ticket?

22:32.804 --> 22:34.805
My girlfriend is in the toilet.

22:36.475 --> 22:38.309
Just a minute, please.

22:49.112 --> 22:50.613
Very well, thank you.

22:56.495 --> 22:59.330
It is man who has created
this terrible immorality...

22:59.414 --> 23:01.791
that threatens to destroy everything
that's good in our society.

23:02.918 --> 23:07.546
Religion and philosophy don't mean a thing
these days. We're on the brink of anarchy.

23:07.631 --> 23:11.008
One of the problems of democracy
is the policy that liberalizes decision.

23:11.093 --> 23:16.555
In other words the average man is incapable of
making sensible or moral decisions for himself.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.058
No one likes the idea
of a totalitarian state...

23:19.142 --> 23:20.851
but China is proof
that it works on the whole.

23:20.936 --> 23:24.272
But I mean there must be a workable
compromise between the two extremes.

23:24.356 --> 23:26.232
Don't you think so, miss?

23:26.358 --> 23:31.028
Uh, yes, because if we exist under a totalitarian
government like China, it defeats our object entirely.

23:31.113 --> 23:32.822
I couldn't agree with you more.

23:32.906 --> 23:35.157
The point is, I'm not trying to
pretend I know the solution.

23:35.242 --> 23:37.118
Believe me, I wish I knew it.

23:37.202 --> 23:39.495
I'm simply presenting
the various possibilities,

23:39.579 --> 23:42.748
the various choices that we have
as a society to overcome the problem.

23:42.833 --> 23:44.750
Unfortunately those systems
that work are-

Thank you.

24:38.431 --> 24:39.931

24:49.150 --> 24:50.650
Thank you.

25:09.837 --> 25:12.381
Hey, what are you doing?
You must be crazy!

25:12.465 --> 25:15.008
Now open the door.
Get out of here!

25:20.056 --> 25:22.140
Is it money you want?
Shh.

25:25.978 --> 25:27.938
No. Leave me alone.

25:29.315 --> 25:32.234
Please, go away.
Leave me alone.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.861
Don't do that or else-

26:53.774 --> 26:56.443
Hey, it's occupied.
Mind your own business.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.445
Hey, what's going on here?

26:59.614 --> 27:01.323
Stop that now.

27:02.742 --> 27:06.077
Hey, come on now.
No nerves, huh?

27:11.250 --> 27:12.959
Let's get out of here.

27:13.044 --> 27:15.670
For God's sake, stop it!
There are kids here! You crazy?

27:15.755 --> 27:18.965
For Christ's sake, what are you playing
at? Somebody oughta call the police.

27:19.091 --> 27:21.551
Hurry.
You're crazy.

27:22.595 --> 27:25.096
He's out cold.
Why don't you leave him alone?

27:29.560 --> 27:31.728
They're crazy, those two boys.
What about her?

27:31.854 --> 27:34.773
She meets someone and does it in
the toilet. She's as crazy as them.

28:24.323 --> 28:25.991
Stay on the train, sir.
Why? What's the matter?

28:26.075 --> 28:27.784
Stay on the train!

28:27.868 --> 28:29.786
Attention, please. Attention.

28:29.870 --> 28:33.039
All passengers are requested
to remain in their places...

28:33.165 --> 28:36.209
until their passports and baggage have
been checked. Passports. Passports, please.

28:36.335 --> 28:40.130
I repeat, all passengers are to remain
on the train. And open that bag, please.

28:46.095 --> 28:47.512
Stay on the train, please, miss.

28:47.597 --> 28:49.514
I just wanted to go
and make a phone call.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.267
Sorry, miss, but I can't let you off the
train. But it's the last chance we'll have...

28:52.351 --> 28:55.604
to warn my friend's parents
of the delay.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.689
All right then.
Thanks a lot.

29:20.129 --> 29:21.671
You say there is another train?

29:21.756 --> 29:25.425
Yeah, and you won't have to change in
Verona. It leaves in about 15 minutes.

29:25.509 --> 29:27.052
All right.
We'll take that one then.

29:50.409 --> 29:52.077
Just a moment.

29:54.246 --> 29:58.541
Hello? Hello.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.720
Ah. Good evening. Good
evening, lady. Sorry I'm late.

30:10.805 --> 30:12.305
Don't worry.

30:12.390 --> 30:14.808
They say they think
there's a bomb on the train.

30:14.892 --> 30:17.519
I don't want to go back on
that train. What do you say?

30:17.603 --> 30:20.980
Well, what are we going to do? My
parents don't answer. They must be out.

30:21.065 --> 30:23.942
Well, I found out there's another train,
and we don't have to change at Verona.

30:24.068 --> 30:28.279
We can catch that one, okay? Sounds like
the best idea. I'll just call a friend.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.496
Hello? Is that you, Marie?
It's Lisa.

30:36.580 --> 30:39.207
No, we're on the way.
And there's no one at home,

30:39.291 --> 30:41.793
so can you call later
and tell my parents we'll be in-

30:41.919 --> 30:44.754
Uh, what time is it? It's
the one that gets in a half hour earlier.

30:44.839 --> 30:48.550
We'll be there half an hour earlier
on the direct train from Innsbruck.

30:48.634 --> 30:51.761
All right? Thanks, Marie. Ciao.

31:39.935 --> 31:42.645
Not this one. It smells.

31:50.404 --> 31:52.197
This one's all right.
Come on.

32:01.958 --> 32:04.710
Ooh, all this room.
What luxury.

32:15.972 --> 32:18.724
It's pretty cold in here.
I wish they'd put the heat on.

32:20.519 --> 32:22.019
This should help.

32:25.565 --> 32:28.609
Here, put this around your legs.

32:28.735 --> 32:31.862
No, it's all right.
This will be fine. Okay.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.542
I wish Helmut had come with us too.

32:44.626 --> 32:48.254
With his acne and
his thick glasses. You're joking.

32:49.381 --> 32:52.633
I'd be a lot less nervous
if he was with us, Lisa.

32:53.927 --> 32:56.971
Having a man by your side
is a nice safe feeling.

32:57.097 --> 33:01.100
Listen, go to sleep. With any luck
you'll dream of your Helmut. Mmm.

33:23.290 --> 33:26.000
Do you think those crazy boys
got off the train?

33:27.252 --> 33:30.212
I just hope they got put in prison.
Now go to sleep.

33:38.972 --> 33:42.057
Hello, darling.
Sorry I'm late.

33:45.812 --> 33:47.730
Hey, that's beautiful.

33:47.814 --> 33:50.232
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You always do things so marvelously.

33:50.317 --> 33:52.318
And you are always late.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.487
You saving electricity?

33:56.865 --> 34:00.075
Let's have a bit of light.
We're having a dinner party.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.745
The house should be bright and happy
- it's Christmas.

34:06.666 --> 34:09.460
I'm sorry, dear, I seem to
have forgotten something.

34:09.543 --> 34:11.420
Merry Christmas.

34:11.504 --> 34:14.797
You finished your role as patriarch
a couple of hours ago.

34:15.675 --> 34:19.261
And who was your special nurse today?
The blonde one?

34:19.346 --> 34:22.097
The one who suddenly
got promoted?

34:22.181 --> 34:27.143
Well, I can only tell you that some are better
than others, and that girl earned her position.

34:27.228 --> 34:29.855
Yes, I can believe that
she earned her position, all right.

34:30.732 --> 34:32.524
Laura, what's the matter?

34:34.194 --> 34:36.820
Don't you understand?
We simply no longer communicate.

34:38.031 --> 34:40.866
But the blame is yours, Giulio.

34:40.951 --> 34:44.536
For years now I have been living with
you, but I haven't been your wife.

34:59.344 --> 35:01.178
Hello, Laura.
Oh. Merry Christmas.

35:02.514 --> 35:04.848

Ciao, Laura.
Ciao.

35:09.187 --> 35:12.147
You look more beautiful every time I see
you. Are you still in love with your husband?

35:13.441 --> 35:15.859
Ah, duck à L'Orange. Put it over there.

Yeah, that's it. Come on. This way.

35:18.071 --> 35:20.531
Let's open the champagne.

35:44.848 --> 35:47.057
Here. It looks good.

35:47.142 --> 35:48.726
It sure does.

35:49.936 --> 35:52.312
Mmm.
Mmm, it is good.

35:52.397 --> 35:54.356
Was I hungry.

35:54.441 --> 35:59.111
Anyway it's something.
I kind of like dinner by candlelight.

36:01.614 --> 36:03.699
You know,
I've been thinking about the future.

- All right, yes.
- Now, I want you to say, "I've done it."

43:15.174 --> 43:17.425
All right. Yes, I've done it.

43:17.509 --> 43:19.844
Now watch us.

43:19.928 --> 43:20.928
Watch us!

45:58.045 --> 45:59.545
Watch out.

46:02.966 --> 46:04.967
Oh, no.

46:20.067 --> 46:23.861
Did any of you read that
terrible thing in the paper the other day?

46:23.945 --> 46:27.239
A young boy got killed by a big dog
when he was stealing some apples.

46:27.324 --> 46:29.033
How awful. That's ridiculous.

46:29.117 --> 46:32.536
To think a boy is killed like that just
because he stole a few miserable apples.

46:32.621 --> 46:36.749
Well, yes, I agree. It's awful,
but there was a notice up on the gate.

46:36.833 --> 46:40.002
It said, "Beware dangerous dog."
It was the boy's own fault.

46:40.087 --> 46:42.004
No one's blaming the owner, Giulio.

46:42.089 --> 46:44.173
But the blame is really ours.

46:44.257 --> 46:47.510
It's society that's created violence.
And that means us.

46:47.594 --> 46:50.721
How can you possibly blame us people
for violence of that kind?

46:50.806 --> 46:52.723
Because we are responsible.

46:52.808 --> 46:55.851
And apart from that,
it's up to us to try to do something about it.

46:55.936 --> 46:57.687
You, for example, Giulio,

46:57.771 --> 47:00.022
you help people
who are already very ill.

47:00.107 --> 47:03.025
But the point is we should prevent
the illness in the first place.

47:03.110 --> 47:04.944
Well, yes, I understand
what you're saying.

47:05.028 --> 47:08.364
Society must try to find a preventative
to violence and I agree.

47:08.448 --> 47:10.866
I think you should start with children.
We need more control,

47:10.951 --> 47:13.786
a better rapport
between school and family.

47:13.870 --> 47:16.747
Things like boredom and lack of
exercise can lead to violence.

47:16.832 --> 47:19.667
That's why I think we should make
all kids play sports.

47:19.751 --> 47:21.836
Don't you think
you're simplifying too much?

47:21.920 --> 47:26.465
I mean, frankly, parental control, sports-
hardly affect violence.

47:26.550 --> 47:28.884
Well, why not?

47:28.969 --> 47:32.430
It might not solve the problem altogether,
but it could make a difference.

47:32.514 --> 47:36.016
Anyway, you're much better qualified as
a psychiatrist to tackle this problem.

47:36.101 --> 47:39.228
My kind of problems are usually
surgical rather than mental.

47:39.312 --> 47:43.941
I don't want a big guard dog, and I'm
not a violent person, as you all know.

48:00.793 --> 48:03.044
You bastard!
You really hurt her.

48:04.422 --> 48:07.215
Look, you bitch,
you ruined me.

48:07.300 --> 48:09.384
You whoring bitch!

48:10.553 --> 48:13.764
You're such a silly girl.
You're asking to be beaten up.

48:13.848 --> 48:15.974
We just want to have fun.
Nothing more.

48:19.854 --> 48:23.523
Hey! You'd do better to find out
if your dick's still working, tiger.

48:23.608 --> 48:25.609
What do you mean?
It's working all right.

48:25.693 --> 48:27.694
I'll show you it's working.

48:28.404 --> 48:30.489
Yeah, I'll show ya.

48:30.573 --> 48:31.740
No.

48:31.824 --> 48:33.533
Don't.

48:34.952 --> 48:37.037
Please.

48:39.624 --> 48:43.084
I think you better do it, dear,
or he might get other ideas.

48:43.169 --> 48:44.920
No. No.

48:46.923 --> 48:49.633
Leave her alone, you bastard! Shut up!

48:50.635 --> 48:53.929
No!

48:58.684 --> 49:01.895
Come on, you bitch.
What are you waiting for?

49:02.772 --> 49:03.855
Yeah.

50:37.950 --> 50:41.328
You see, I told ya. It still works.

50:41.412 --> 50:43.788
You did that very well, dear,

50:43.873 --> 50:45.999
considering you're only a novice.

50:47.001 --> 50:49.461
The only thing is
we didn't see anything.

50:49.545 --> 50:53.006
Yeah, right.
It's a shame we didn't see anything.

50:53.090 --> 50:55.091
Let's have her do
a strip for us.

50:55.176 --> 50:57.052
Or at least something anyway.

50:57.136 --> 51:01.014
Go on. Take your panties off.

51:01.098 --> 51:04.809
No. Please.
Don't ask me to do that.

51:04.894 --> 51:07.270
Haven't we done enough?
Please leave us alone.

51:07.355 --> 51:10.857
Take it easy.
You needn't be afraid.

51:10.942 --> 51:14.152
We simply want to see
what's between your legs.

51:14.236 --> 51:16.488
I can't take them off.
Please don't ask.

51:17.448 --> 51:19.532
Well, you better, sweetheart.

51:19.617 --> 51:22.077
Now then, take them off
as the lady asked.

51:22.161 --> 51:25.121
If you don't,
I'll be forced to do it myself.

52:02.910 --> 52:05.370
I think you should
take them right off, dear,

52:05.454 --> 52:07.956
or we'll never see your little nookie.

52:19.635 --> 52:22.053
You filthy animals!
You bastards!

52:22.179 --> 52:24.389
Shut up. Leave her
alone! Leave her alone!

52:24.473 --> 52:26.975
No! No!

52:28.310 --> 52:30.103
Shut up!

52:31.480 --> 52:34.941
Now, just let me do
it, and I promise I won't hurt you.

52:43.159 --> 52:45.744
No. Let her do it by herself.

53:46.680 --> 53:50.183
Hey, we've picked up
an audience. Ask him in.

53:51.769 --> 53:53.895
Yeah, please come in.

53:54.021 --> 53:56.773
Excuse me. I was just passing
- No, don't go.

53:56.857 --> 54:00.902
Stick around for a while. It's fun.
You can join the action.

54:00.986 --> 54:03.029
It's all the same to you, isn't it, honey?

54:03.114 --> 54:05.406
And we don't wanna
disappoint the lady.

55:30.868 --> 55:33.411
Oh, dear, this one's being sick.

55:33.495 --> 55:36.706
You dirty bitch.
Stick your head out the window.

55:51.848 --> 55:54.308
Oh, I hope
she didn't dirty my coat.

56:24.839 --> 56:27.424
So there I was, right in
the middle of town with no pants.

56:27.509 --> 56:29.009
How embarrassing.

56:29.094 --> 56:31.595
Laura, may I have the honor
of this dance?

56:31.680 --> 56:33.847
You're forgiven everything,
Dr. Stradi.

56:33.932 --> 56:36.600
Thank you. Let's make
a fresh beginning, all right?

56:36.685 --> 56:38.102
All right.

56:38.186 --> 56:41.063
Classical ]

56:48.738 --> 56:51.365
Does it make you sick
to watch people screwing?

56:52.325 --> 56:54.410
Don't tell me you're a virgin.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.453
Yes.

56:56.538 --> 56:58.539
She's a virgin, she says.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.500
Do you think so?

57:03.878 --> 57:05.546
Leave her alone.

57:05.630 --> 57:08.757
Why, she's not a virgin.
She's just lying.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.677
Don't!

57:11.803 --> 57:14.388
Be good.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.475
Go on.
Give it to her.

57:32.032 --> 57:34.491
Stop your wailing.

57:34.576 --> 57:36.994
Goddamn it!
She's no good.

57:37.078 --> 57:39.913
Jesus! She's as tight
as a frightened asshole.

57:49.257 --> 57:53.927
No! No!

58:16.326 --> 58:19.203
If you can't do it one way,
let's do it another. Huh?

58:26.795 --> 58:29.630
Are you right out
of your fucking mind?

58:31.299 --> 58:33.342
Put the knife away.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.803
Don't be an idiot.

58:37.764 --> 58:40.224
Mind your own
bleeding business.

58:45.688 --> 58:48.190
That's it. Yeah.

58:49.442 --> 58:50.651
Bastard.

58:50.735 --> 58:53.028
Hey, we'll only cut her a little.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.824
I'm doing this for you, honey.

58:56.908 --> 58:59.618
You'll see. You'll love it
once your virginity's gone.

58:59.702 --> 59:02.496
You know,
I was deflowered this way.

59:02.580 --> 59:04.123
A scalpel actually.

59:04.207 --> 59:06.208
Yes, by a doctor.

59:06.292 --> 59:08.710
I was pregnant,
but I was also a virgin.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.088
No!

59:15.260 --> 59:16.677
No!

59:16.761 --> 59:19.179
Hold still!

59:19.264 --> 59:22.266
Hold still, or it'll
be worse for you.

59:23.226 --> 59:25.769
No. No. That's enough!

59:25.895 --> 59:29.106
I'll do anything you want.
Too late, my dear.

59:29.190 --> 59:32.276
No!

59:32.360 --> 59:33.819
Get on with it.
No!

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:15.736
No.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:21.074
I never wanted t-
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:11.792
Don't. I'm embarrassed, darling.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.887
Don't let her get away!

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:25.806
Help! Help!

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.749
You little bitch.
Quit pretending.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:57.087
I know you're all right. You're
just pretending to be dead.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:03.010
You're just pretending,
damn you.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.365
Ow! What are you doing?
You crazy?

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:48.950
You bitch.

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:52.120
I ought to kill you now.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:54.372
This is your fault.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.624
But I-
You're a mad woman, lady.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.419
What did I do wrong?

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.677
Here. Take this.

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:10.638
You're gonna need it.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.474
It wasn't anybody's fault.

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:16.394
It was just one of those things.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:18.813
I- This hurts.

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:23.151
And nobody will ever know.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.504
Tickets, please.

01:04:56.435 --> 01:05:00.605
The next station is where
you two get off Okay?

01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:35.324
It's late.
Par for the course.

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:39.120
I've never seen this station so empty.
Yeah.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.374
It's freezing.
What do expect at this hour?

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:50.256
You're looking forward
to seeing her, aren't you?

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.008
I sure am.

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:54.468
Well, here it is now.

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:25.708
That's strange. Where are they?

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.793
Are you sure this is the right train?

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:36.552
Well?
Yes, this is the right train.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:40.348
Then why aren't they on it?
I don't know.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.726
I'm sure they said-
Good morning, Dr. Stradi.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.729
Ah. Hello there. Merry Christmas.

01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:48.731
The same to you.
Thanks.

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.692
Are you waiting for your daughter? Yeah.
She was supposed to be on that train.

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:55.780
She started out in Munich, was to change
at Verona. Yet there's no sign of her on it.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.115
She could have missed the Verona
connection if her train was late.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.785
If you don't mind waiting a while, I'll put a
call through to Verona and see what happened.

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.870
Yes, we'll wait. Thanks a lot.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.084
Damn trains.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:11.003
They should have flown.
That can be just as bad.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.470
I'm sorry about this, Doctor.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.682
Apparently all the trains in Germany
have had long delays,

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:25.267
so I'm sure she must have
missed her connection. Oh!

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:29.397
What about the Munich train? When does that get
to Verona? We could drive up and meet her there.

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.732
They don't know yet exactly.
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.194
Now what?

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.113
Listen, could you do us a favor?
Sure.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.823
Telephone us at the house when you
have definite news. Yes. Certainly.

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:42.993
That way we won't have to wait around
here. I'd really appreciate that.

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:45.203
All right. Good-bye.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.191
Dr. Stradi, could you come
for a moment, please?

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:16.777
There's a woman
in the waiting room who's hurt.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.863
I'll wait here. I won't
be a minute, darling.

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:22.283
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
I'll be right back.

01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:26.412
This way, Doctor.
Right.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.122
It's quicker around here.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.917
Sorry to bother you like this, but it looks like quite
a nasty cut, and I wouldn't know what to do about it.

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:36.839
♪♪

01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:48.434
Oh, you really shouldn't have
bothered. Oh, don't be silly.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.312
Now then, let's see
what we've got here.

01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:53.898
How did you manage to do this?
I fell down on the street.

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:56.525
It's so stupid of me.
Well, it's not too serious.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.320
But it should have a couple of stitches
to hold it together.

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.949
You'll have to go
to- to emergency.

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:06.494
There's a hospital nearby.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.458
To the hospital?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.961
Oh, no, Doctor. I don't want to go
to a hospital on Christmas Day.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:19.090
Well, there's not very much
I can do. I'm sorry.

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.258
Oh, please, Doctor.

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:23.094
Well, I don't have
any instruments here.

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:24.762
Where are they? At the house?

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.306
Well, yes-
Couldn't you do it there?

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.520
Well, all right.
You'll have to come home.

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:35.189
Thank you. You're an angel.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.633
I think I caught a cold on that damn-

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:06.095
In the dance
hall, it wasn't heated.

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.932
Well, uh, tell me.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.434
What made you decide to
spend your vacation in Italy?

01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:15.271
You have family here? No, we're camping near the lake.

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.856
Ah.

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:19.900
What are you laughing at?

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:22.904
It's true, really.
I met them at the campsite this morning,

01:11:22.989 --> 01:11:25.991
and they said they'd help me
when they saw I was hurt.

01:11:31.956 --> 01:11:33.623
There we are.

01:11:33.749 --> 01:11:35.834
Thank you, Doctor.
You're welcome.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.087
Um, how much do I owe you?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

01:11:39.213 --> 01:11:41.381
You don't owe me anything.
That's very sweet of you. Thanks.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:44.426
Um, do you think
you could call me a taxi?

01:11:44.552 --> 01:11:47.512
Well, let's see. Maybe easier
if I drive you in. Thank you.

01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:50.599
Can you manage all right?
Yes. Yes.

01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:57.522
Does it feel better?
Yes. Much better.

01:11:57.607 --> 01:12:00.317
Try and rest it as much as you can,
give it a chance to heal.

01:12:00.443 --> 01:12:01.818
Giulio. Yes, dear.

01:12:01.944 --> 01:12:04.905
I've got something to eat
for them. Ah. This way.

01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:12.120
Oh, you didn't have to do this.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.582
Well, it's Christmas,
and you have to eat.

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:17.876
Mmm. This looks marvelous.

01:12:18.002 --> 01:12:20.462
I'll get it.

01:12:26.677 --> 01:12:29.846
No, my dear, they're not here yet.
The trains have been delayed.

01:12:29.931 --> 01:12:33.391
Well, you know how traveling is these days.
Don't worry. They'll be here soon.

01:12:33.476 --> 01:12:35.685
Yes, we're waiting to hear
from the station now.

01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:37.437
Who is it, Giulio?
Herta in Munich.

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:39.105
She wanted to talk to Margaret.

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.274
Don't hang up.
I want to talk to her.

01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:44.319
Right. Hold on, Herta.
Laura wants to say hello.

01:12:49.242 --> 01:12:51.159
Fill her up, please.

01:12:52.787 --> 01:12:55.747
Hello there. Is that you, Louis?

01:12:55.831 --> 01:13:00.418
Yes. Yes, I'll be home in about a couple
of hours, and I got the present you wanted.

01:13:00.503 --> 01:13:03.088
Afraid I missed the train.
Tell Mama, huh?

01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:05.840
Yes. See you later, Son.

01:13:15.184 --> 01:13:18.228
I'll never get a taxi today. How the
hell will I ever get to the airport, huh?

01:13:18.312 --> 01:13:21.022
I don't know, sir. I guess you'll have to
wait here for someone who's going that way.

01:13:21.524 --> 01:13:23.275
Is it all right?
Mmm, yes.

01:13:25.778 --> 01:13:27.153
Wonderful.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.698
Don't you want coffee, darling?
Yes, thanks.

01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:32.117
Here is the news.

01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:36.037
Thousands of people packed into St. Peter's
Square this morning for Christmas Mass.

01:13:36.122 --> 01:13:40.542
The pope blessed the crowd
and later gave a special prayer for world peace.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:44.504
The service was heard and watched
by millions of Catholics all over the world.

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:50.176
An hour ago, the body of a 16 or 17-year-old girl
was found by the Innsbruck-Verona railway track.

01:13:50.303 --> 01:13:55.890
The police who are investigating this tragedy have
not as yet ruled out the possibility of foul play.

01:13:56.017 --> 01:13:59.227
It's Christmas
Day too. Violence and killing.

01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:01.813
I think I'll turn it off.

01:14:01.897 --> 01:14:04.107
It's too depressing.

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:11.614
You feeling ill?

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:14.534
A little. I feel a bit dizzy.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.453
Would you like to lie down? You should.

01:14:16.537 --> 01:14:18.079
Ah, yes.
I'll take you upstairs.

01:14:18.164 --> 01:14:19.664
Thanks very much.

01:14:53.407 --> 01:14:56.159
Hello. Police here. Can I help you?

01:14:56.243 --> 01:14:58.703
I think I know who killed that girl.

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:01.831
You should look for a well-dressed
young blonde woman.

01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:05.877
She's about 30 years old and is traveling
with a couple of young thugs.

01:15:05.961 --> 01:15:08.922
I saw those three
with two young girls on the train.

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:11.174
What is your name, please, sir,
and where are you calling from?

01:15:11.258 --> 01:15:12.801
They are the murderers.

01:15:28.234 --> 01:15:33.823
Giulio.

01:15:34.907 --> 01:15:36.408
Yes?

01:15:37.201 --> 01:15:38.743
Listen, dear.

01:15:38.828 --> 01:15:40.703
Did you see
that scarf he's wearing?

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.666
The awful bright turquoise one, with
the hand-painted picture on it. Well?

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:48.420
Herta said Lisa bought one in Munich,
and well, I began to wonder.

01:15:48.504 --> 01:15:49.587
Wonder what?

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:53.466
I don't know. Just intuition.
I thought it was a strange coincidence.

01:15:53.551 --> 01:15:57.554
My dear, I bet they sold
thousands of the things already.

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:59.764
Uh, how is she?

01:15:59.849 --> 01:16:02.350
She's lying down.
She's all right, I guess.

01:16:06.897 --> 01:16:08.273
What's up?

01:16:08.357 --> 01:16:10.442
Those two are onto us.

01:16:10.526 --> 01:16:12.110
You're crazy.

01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:15.488
No, I'm sure of it.
They've been looking at me strangely.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.532
Why don't you
shut your mouth, you idiot?

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:19.659
He probably knows
you're shooting horse.

01:16:22.788 --> 01:16:24.330
I'll get it, dear.

01:16:27.877 --> 01:16:29.919
Hello. Dr. Stradi.

01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:33.882
Hello, Doctor? This is the stationmaster.
Well, I'm glad you called. What news?

01:16:33.966 --> 01:16:36.968
Well, apparently that train from Munich
had to be searched.

01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:38.970
They had warning
there was a bomb somewhere on it.

01:16:39.054 --> 01:16:40.972
What did you say? A bomb?

01:16:41.056 --> 01:16:44.476
Yes, Doctor. Anyway, they had to search the whole train
- everybody's baggage.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.728
They checked passports and
everything. That's why it was delayed.

01:16:46.812 --> 01:16:49.981
Yes, but did they find it? No.
Nothing. It must have been a hoax.

01:16:50.065 --> 01:16:52.901
It'll arrive in Verona in two
hours. About two hours, you say?

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:54.569
11:00, 11:15.
Fine.

01:16:55.279 --> 01:16:57.238
Fine. Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

01:16:57.323 --> 01:16:59.073
Mm-hmm. You're welcome, Doctor.

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:06.498
Is anything wrong, Giulio?
No, nothing's wrong.

01:17:06.582 --> 01:17:08.458
Nothing serious.

01:17:08.542 --> 01:17:12.253
The train was held up for a while.
It'll be here in a couple of hours.

01:17:44.662 --> 01:17:46.579
I know what we'll do, Laura.

01:17:46.664 --> 01:17:49.332
We'll pick the girls up
at Verona, all right?

01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:51.626
Put your coat on. I'll warm up the car.

01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:16.337
Tell your friends to get ready.
I'll drop you in town.

01:19:50.163 --> 01:19:52.539
Hey, you finished yet?

01:19:52.624 --> 01:19:55.626
- They'll give us a ride into town.
- Yes, I'm ready.

01:19:57.087 --> 01:19:59.672
Jesus, ain't they got
no crapper in this joint?

01:19:59.756 --> 01:20:02.591
They've got five or six.
There's one through there.

01:20:45.009 --> 01:20:47.010
Classical ]

01:20:47.095 --> 01:20:49.388
Merry Christmas, Doctor.
Where's Lisa?

01:20:49.472 --> 01:20:51.807
Hello, Marie.
She's not here yet, I'm afraid.

01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:54.643
That's strange. She called me
yesterday evening from Austria.

01:20:54.728 --> 01:20:56.937
She tried to call you,
but there was no answer.

01:20:57.021 --> 01:21:00.607
Their train was stopped, so they were planning
to come on a train directly from Innsbruck.

01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:03.652
Maybe they changed
their minds.

01:21:05.447 --> 01:21:06.864
I don't know. I guess so.

01:21:06.948 --> 01:21:09.032
Well, when she gets in,
tell her to call, will you?

01:21:09.159 --> 01:21:11.744
I'll be at home.
All right, Marie, yes.

01:21:11.828 --> 01:21:14.538
Good-bye, Doctor.
Bye, dear.

01:21:28.344 --> 01:21:32.723
Here is a special news flash
on the still unsolved Christmas Day tragedy.

01:21:32.849 --> 01:21:37.394
The body of another young girl has been
found alongside the Innsbruck-Verona track.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.649
Police have also recovered baggage and clothing
that they think belong to the two victims.

01:21:42.776 --> 01:21:47.780
One of the girls was definitely murdered on
the train, having been violated with a knife.

01:21:47.864 --> 01:21:51.450
Police speculate that the second girl
may have jumped from the train in terror...

01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:53.786
and died as a result of the fall.

01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:58.081
From the articles found alongside the track,
police have recovered one passport.

01:21:58.166 --> 01:22:02.044
It is that of Margaret Hollendorf,
a resident of Munich and one of-

01:22:10.053 --> 01:22:11.553
Oh, my God!

01:22:13.431 --> 01:22:16.391
Oh, God, no. It can't be true.

01:22:19.813 --> 01:22:22.981
Lisa.

01:22:23.066 --> 01:22:24.775
Lisa, Lisa.

01:22:44.921 --> 01:22:46.505
You killed them!

01:22:46.589 --> 01:22:49.633
- That scarf was Lisa's. You were on the
train with them. - What are you doing?

01:22:49.717 --> 01:22:51.134
That's why you were at the station.

01:22:51.261 --> 01:22:53.303
You and your friends killed Margaret
and Lisa! I had nothing to do with it!

01:22:53.429 --> 01:22:56.098
It was you and your friends. Please
listen to me. It was the others who did it.

01:22:56.182 --> 01:22:58.600
You were there too,
so I'm going to kill you.

01:22:58.685 --> 01:23:02.563
But it was the others who did it. I had nothing
to do with it. Don't you realize they're on drugs?

01:23:02.647 --> 01:23:04.731
Then I'll kill them
as soon as I've killed you.

01:23:04.816 --> 01:23:07.150
No, believe me, I couldn't help it.
They said they'd kill me.

01:23:07.235 --> 01:23:09.695
They're crazy, drug addicts.
Don't you understand?

01:23:09.779 --> 01:23:11.655
There was nothing I could do.

01:23:11.739 --> 01:23:13.532
