01:04.593 --> 01:06.159
(KION READING)

01:14.568 --> 01:17.535
Ono, how's it looking
from up there?

01:17.537 --> 01:19.503
We've got
       a big rain cloud
          moving in.

01:19.505 --> 01:21.938
Other than that,
  no signs of trouble.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.306
Wait.

01:24.242 --> 01:25.774
Mzingo and the vultures.

01:25.776 --> 01:27.075
They're circling...

01:27.077 --> 01:29.510
And that usually
         is a sign of trouble.

01:29.512 --> 01:31.245
Let's go see
     what they're up to.

01:31.247 --> 01:32.546
Ono, lead the way!

01:32.548 --> 01:33.680
Affirmative!

01:37.518 --> 01:39.718
So, where are you
      taking me exactly?

01:39.720 --> 01:42.721
Don't worry,
           we're almost there.

01:42.723 --> 01:44.723
KIARA:
You know I have
to be back soon.

01:44.725 --> 01:48.026
It's the first time
I'm presiding over
the Royal Buffalo Wallow.

01:48.028 --> 01:50.361
My mom and dad
       won't be there.
        It's just me.

01:50.363 --> 01:52.496
So I have to make
      a good impression.

01:53.866 --> 01:55.699
(GIGGLES)
          Of course.

01:55.701 --> 01:57.600
That's what
   this is all about.

01:57.602 --> 01:58.634
And...

01:58.636 --> 02:01.703
You were going to help me
get ready, remember?

02:01.705 --> 02:02.870
We will, Kiara.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.305
Look.
                  Here we are!

02:05.307 --> 02:07.407
Urembo Meadows!

02:07.409 --> 02:09.809
And we're here...
             Why?

02:09.811 --> 02:14.045
(SIGHS) You need
to look your best for
your princessy duties.

02:14.047 --> 02:15.880
What's wrong with
     the way I look now?

02:15.882 --> 02:17.748
Nothing, Kiara!
       Nothing at all!

02:17.750 --> 02:20.884
Nothing that
we can't fix.
(GIGGLES)

02:20.886 --> 02:23.419
Oh, c'mon Kiara!
              It'll be fun!

02:23.421 --> 02:24.486
Okay.

02:24.488 --> 02:26.321
I guess
         I have a little time.

02:26.323 --> 02:28.022
(SHRIEKING)

02:31.594 --> 02:33.627

02:33.629 --> 02:35.829
I move we forego
     prolonged debate...

02:35.831 --> 02:37.664
And dive into business.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.732
I second the motion.

(SCREECHING)

02:42.569 --> 02:43.501

02:48.174 --> 02:49.339
Go ahead.

02:49.341 --> 02:51.140
Make your move, Mwoga!

02:51.142 --> 02:52.608
Don't worry, baboonie!

02:52.610 --> 02:54.176
The Lion Guard will save you.

         You're safe.

03:09.421 --> 03:10.753
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:14.591 --> 03:15.756
First baboons,

03:15.758 --> 03:16.923
now rain...

03:16.925 --> 03:18.925
(SIGHS)
Could it get any better?

03:22.163 --> 03:23.695
(SCREECHING)

03:23.697 --> 03:25.263
Oh, no!
          Baboonie!

03:26.866 --> 03:28.465
Fuli! The baboon!

03:28.467 --> 03:30.166
You're the only one
           fast enough!

03:30.168 --> 03:32.201
Got it, Kion.
<i>Huwezi!</i>

03:36.640 --> 03:38.039
You know, Kiara,

03:38.041 --> 03:41.509
a little moisture is good
for your complexion.

03:41.511 --> 03:42.943
A little moisture?

03:42.945 --> 03:44.844
This rainstorm
           could last all day.

03:47.615 --> 03:48.547
Huh?

03:52.552 --> 03:55.052
(BOTH INHALING)

03:56.789 --> 03:58.455
After all that rain,

03:58.457 --> 04:01.024
the flowers smell
             even sweeter!

04:01.026 --> 04:04.961
Which means
you'll smell even sweeter
for the Buffalo Wallow!

04:05.630 --> 04:06.929

04:10.367 --> 04:11.733
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

04:20.142 --> 04:21.406
Oh, no.

04:21.409 --> 04:22.808
That was
            our only way back!

04:26.312 --> 04:27.711
Huh?

04:27.713 --> 04:29.779
I don't remember an island
    being there before...

04:31.516 --> 04:32.781
Kiara?

04:35.752 --> 04:37.485
(GRUNTING)

04:37.487 --> 04:39.987
Hold on!
    I've got you! (GRUNTS)

04:41.724 --> 04:42.856
There, you're safe.

04:42.858 --> 04:44.057
Again.

04:44.059 --> 04:46.526
(GIBBERING)

04:46.528 --> 04:49.729
(GROANS)
   Maybe you should
   go on home now.

04:50.698 --> 04:52.664
Aw, that's so cute!

04:52.666 --> 04:54.432
I think the little guy
likes you.

04:54.434 --> 04:56.700
Too bad Fuli
         doesn't like baboons.

04:56.702 --> 04:58.601
I like baboons just fine.

04:58.603 --> 05:01.070
As long as they're not
  anywhere near me.

05:01.705 --> 05:03.538
Everyone.
          Everyone!

05:03.540 --> 05:05.006
You won't believe this, but...

05:05.008 --> 05:06.707
(COOING)

05:06.709 --> 05:08.608
Somebody want
to get this thing off me?

05:08.610 --> 05:11.377
Somebody want to get me
off this island?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.511
Kiara?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.012
Oh. Yes.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.114
That's what I was going
 to say you wouldn't believe.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.884
I thought
   Dad asked you to handle
 the Buffalo Wallow ceremony.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.685
What are you doing
       on that island?

05:21.687 --> 05:23.887
It's wasn't an island
when we got here.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.556
The rain washed away
all the land around us.

05:26.558 --> 05:27.723
Relax, Kiara.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.858
We'll get you
       off that island.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.025
Yeah, Kiara!

05:31.027 --> 05:32.292
Listen to Kion.

05:32.294 --> 05:35.028
Come and relax
       in the flowers.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.397
By the time
  the Lion Guard rescues us,

05:37.399 --> 05:41.200
we'll have you smelling
       and looking great for
       the buffaloes.

05:41.202 --> 05:42.701
Uh, Kion?

05:42.703 --> 05:44.269
What're we going
to do with this guy?

05:44.271 --> 05:46.104
We need to get him home.

05:46.106 --> 05:50.207
His family probably lives
     in the big baboon tree in
     Nyani Grove.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.741
It's not far.

05:51.743 --> 05:54.877
So it shouldn't take you
  too long to get him home.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.545
Me? Uh...

05:56.547 --> 05:59.080
Don't you need me
       to help you get
    Kiara off the island?

05:59.082 --> 06:01.449
We can manage
until you get back.

06:01.451 --> 06:05.319
Besides, I think
       that baby baboon
       kinda likes you.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.987

06:13.260 --> 06:14.826
Be right back.

06:14.828 --> 06:15.693

06:16.429 --> 06:17.661

06:38.978 --> 06:40.277
Well, here you are.

06:40.279 --> 06:43.079
Back home in Nyani Grove.

06:43.081 --> 06:45.781
Now I can get back
  to helping the Lion Guard.

06:45.783 --> 06:46.915
Baboons?

06:46.917 --> 06:48.783
Hello!

06:48.785 --> 06:49.884
Anybody home?

06:51.487 --> 06:52.986
Fuli of the Lion Guard?

06:52.988 --> 06:55.421
What are you doing here?

06:55.423 --> 06:58.757
I just wanted to make sure
   this baby got home safe.

06:59.159 --> 07:01.259
Ah... (HOOTS)

07:01.261 --> 07:02.360
That's nice of you.

07:02.362 --> 07:04.228
Just one little problem.

07:05.297 --> 07:06.929
That's not our baby.

07:06.931 --> 07:10.364
(HOOTS) He belongs
to our, uh, neighbors.

07:10.366 --> 07:11.698
Fine.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.700
Which tree do they live in?

07:13.702 --> 07:15.368
(LAUGHING) Tree?

07:17.038 --> 07:19.138
They don't live
       in a tree, Fuli.

07:19.140 --> 07:22.607
They live
on Mapango Cliffs.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.808
In a cave.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.778
Way up at the top.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.714
Way up at the top?

07:29.716 --> 07:34.484
(SIGHS) Guess this is going
   to take a little longer
       than I thought.

07:36.821 --> 07:37.953
Fuli?

07:37.955 --> 07:40.722
When you see
the cliff baboons,

07:40.724 --> 07:43.091
will you give them
      a message from us?

07:43.093 --> 07:44.225
What is it?

07:44.227 --> 07:46.227

Ugh! I said,

And I don't want to keep
      the buffaloes waiting.

08:47.808 --> 08:50.275
We have to find a way
     to cross that river!

08:50.277 --> 08:52.377
But why even attend
     the buffalo ceremony

08:52.379 --> 08:53.878

          your best?

08:55.047 --> 08:57.881

09:01.652 --> 09:03.618
A-ha! I got it!

Use the Roar to get
         rid of all the water!

09:05.455 --> 09:08.155
Then they could just
           walk off the island.

09:08.157 --> 09:10.857
Unless the Roar
     destroys the island.

09:10.859 --> 09:12.325
That wouldn't be good.

But there might be
another way to get them
off the island.

       you look better.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.903
There are more important
  things than how you look.

20:25.972 --> 20:28.005
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:28.007 --> 20:30.340
I have a royal duty
           to perform.

20:31.109 --> 20:32.641
(BUFFALO GRUNTING)

20:32.643 --> 20:34.576
Your Highness.

20:34.578 --> 20:35.810
Vuruga Vuruga.

20:35.812 --> 20:37.311
So good to see you.

20:37.313 --> 20:38.612
And you.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.548
I must say,
        you look ready
       for the Wallow!

20:43.585 --> 20:47.653
Usually the royals
     are always so stuffy
       at these things.

20:47.655 --> 20:51.323
But this,
      this is most impressive!

20:51.325 --> 20:56.494
Clearly, you understand
   what the Buffalo Wallow
        is all about.

20:56.496 --> 20:59.697
Uh, thank you,
        Vuruga Vuruga.

20:59.699 --> 21:02.332
Though Zuri and Tiifu deserve
   some of the credit, too.

21:04.336 --> 21:07.437
They always insist
I try to look my best.

21:10.642 --> 21:11.774
Now!

21:11.776 --> 21:14.543
Let the Buffalo Wallow begin!

21:14.545 --> 21:16.344
(BUFFALO LOWING)

21:33.829 --> 21:35.228
<i> Poa!</i>

21:35.230 --> 21:37.296
That sure looks like fun.

21:37.298 --> 21:38.730
Fuli?

21:38.732 --> 21:41.733
(SIGHS)
        Sorry it took so long.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.701
The baby baboon's home safe.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.137
Just wasn't as simple
     as I thought it would be.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.774
Nothing's ever simple
        when it comes
     to Fuli and baboons.

21:50.776 --> 21:54.144
Yeah!
Bet you're glad to be rid of
that pesky little baboonie.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.845
(LAUGHS) You know it.

22:00.751 --> 22:02.217
(SOFTLY) Baboons.

22:03.305 --> 22:09.788
