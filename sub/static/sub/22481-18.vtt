WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:04.105
Back to our roots.
Patrol day.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.206
Chasing calls.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.274
Rolling in black and whites.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.408
Hitting the front lines.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.776
Wearing polyester pants.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.111
CORTEZ:
Happy patrol day.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.113
You know the drill.
Once a month...

00:12.180 --> 00:15.083
We help out
with crime suppression
in high-volume areas.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.285
Keeps our street game sharp.
LUCA: And our
foodie game on point.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.919
Just downloaded
the food truck map.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.688
Gonna make the rounds today.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.956
Chicken and Waffle Wagon,
Hot Ribs on Hot Wheels...

00:23.023 --> 00:24.325
There's no way
I'm eating that stuff.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.327
CORTEZ: While Hondo
and Mumford's teams
are on patrol,

00:26.394 --> 00:28.996
Vandelli's team will be
taking point on all
S.W.A.T. calls

00:29.063 --> 00:30.098
if anything pops up.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.232
You have your assignments.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.301
Street and Tan,
Olympic division.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.802
Rash of daytime
robberies this week.
Mmm-hmm.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.969
Got a description
of the thief.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.138
Chris, you're with Mumford.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.107
Van Nuys division.
Standard patrol.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.908
Where is Hondo?
CORTEZ:
He needed a personal day.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.443
You and Luca...

00:42.510 --> 00:44.778
We got Mid-City
Wilshire division.
...have been reassigned.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.013
You're with me, here at HQ.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.182
There are some
at-risk kids visiting today,

00:48.249 --> 00:50.118
part of our new
community outreach.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.319
These kids are at

00:51.385 --> 00:52.586
Serious behavioral
problems at school.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.322
They're all in danger
of being expelled.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.590
So we reach out to them now,
we don't have
to lock 'em up later.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.992
That's the idea.
Thanks, everyone, be safe.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.196
Don't worry, Luca, we'll hit
that Chicken and Waffle Wagon
for you.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.731
CHRIS:
I don't get it.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.666
Mumford requested me
as his patrol partner

01:05.733 --> 01:07.501
Come on, now, Chris,
he's losing Sanderson.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.637
My guess, you little hotshot,
is he's poaching you.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.340
Please, no.
Look, the higher-ups want
some diversity on his team.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.742
I guess we've been
making 'em look
a little too white and male.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.377
So he wants me
to fill a quota?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.979
It's the same old, same old,
Chris, you know what it is.
Just be you.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.314
What do you think
his pitch is gonna be?

01:20.381 --> 01:21.515
Honestly, I have no idea,

01:21.582 --> 01:22.850
but, man, I would
love to hear it.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.685
It's gonna be sweet
turning him down.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.488
Okay. Hey, don't go
having too much fun with that.
I'll try not to, boss.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.557
I'll drive.
Take-charge attitude.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.492
I like that, Alonso.

01:31.559 --> 01:32.860
So sweet.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.233
Looking good, Brianna.
Don't try
to butter me up.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.034
You were supposed
to have been here yesterday.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.704
Okay, slow down,
I had a hostage situation
that made me miss my flight.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.706
Likely story.
Can you stop
your fussing

01:45.773 --> 01:47.175
and just give your
brother a hug?

01:48.542 --> 01:49.777
Good to see you.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.145
Ah, it's really good
to see you.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.580
Thanks for holding down
Oakland for me.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.814
You're welcome.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.383
And if you want
to be a real hero,

01:55.449 --> 01:57.117
help me get Dad moved to L.A.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.319
Come on.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.156
How's your job
at the Getty?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.392
Good.
I'm curating an installation.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.026
Interpretive media piece.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.661
Lot of lights.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.697
Nice.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.165
Brie, what the hell
is all of this?

02:11.232 --> 02:13.133
I thought the deal
was you pack up Pops,

02:13.201 --> 02:14.802
and then I fly up here
to help you

02:14.868 --> 02:16.537
move him to L.A.
to live with you.
Some deal.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.406
He told me this morning
he changed his mind.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.007
So what did I
fly up here for?
Hondo,

02:20.073 --> 02:22.410
he can't live
on his own anymore.
He's getting worse.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.812
I just talked
to the man a week ago.
He's the same as always.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.680
You do know
what MG is, right?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.382
He's got
muscle weakness,

02:28.449 --> 02:31.018
blurred vision, sometimes it's
hard for him to breathe.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.387
And he's been living
with it for over a year,
and he's been fine.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.389
Brie, he's a
grown-ass man.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.358
If he doesn't want to move,
why you trying to force him?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.693
His doctor says
he needs full attention.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.829
He certainly can't be
walking up and down
these stairs every day.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.298
Okay, what about your mom?
Is there any chance of them
getting back together?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.267
No. She's done.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.601
Got herself a new man.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.370
Oh, for real?
What's his name

02:49.437 --> 02:51.171
Oh, you funny.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.542
Still talking about Pops
leaving your mom for mine.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.776
I'm just saying.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.579
My mom's been
predicting this day.
For 30 years.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.647
Yeah, I know.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.818
The old man still
has his wall of fame.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.195
You know, my dad,
he introduced me to jazz.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.064
Gil Scott-Heron.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.068
He taught me how to make
Louisiana gumbo right there.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.404
Taught you how to cook,
gave me the art bug.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.508
I'm worried about him.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.042
See for yourself.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.814
One of us needs to talk him
into moving to L.A.,

03:33.881 --> 03:36.384
and I... I am all out
of arguments.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.953
Hey.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.289
I'm sorry.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.123
I didn't mean to
dump it all on you.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.758
It's gonna be okay.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.527
Where is he?
Where else?

03:46.594 --> 03:47.628
The ROMEO Club.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.532
Can I borrow your car?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.467
My backup's been on
my left ankle since
I was boot.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.537
Most cops carry their clutch
piece at the waistband.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.706
But whatever works
for you, you know?

03:58.772 --> 04:02.276
I... I'm open to new ideas,
new approaches.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.544
Good to know.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.178
How's things on Team Hondo?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.980
No complaints.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.317
Treats me well.
DISPATCHER:
All units, we have shots fired

04:09.383 --> 04:11.118
in the 1300 block
of Victory Boulevard.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.688
50-David to Control, show us
responding to shots fired.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.993
Come on.
Help me!
Please help me!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.662
It's all right, I got you.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.963
He tried to kill me.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.565
All of us,
and then he just ran off.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.833
Anybody else in there?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.200
My patient, he shot him!

04:27.267 --> 04:28.302
CHRIS:
Easy, easy.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.870
What's your name?
Dr. Korva Green.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.372
Let me see.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.441
50-David, making entry
to the building.
Looks like a flesh wound.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.545
24-David, we're Code 6
at a shooting call.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.779
I need an R.A. for a female.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.016
MUMFORD:
I got a 187 in Office 230.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.354
Send backup to clear
the rest of the building.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.556
He pointed the gun
right at me,
but it didn't fire.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.990
He said he was going
to get another one.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.992
Another gun?
D.O.A. inside.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
In our sessions,
he never talked about guns.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.063
And the shooter
was a patient of yours?
Yeah.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.165
Hey, it's okay.
You got this. Hey.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.833
Hey. Breathe.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.702
Breathe.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.737
What was his name?
Uh, Zack Calnick.

05:03.804 --> 05:08.175
Uh, he was in a court-ordered
intervention program
as part of his probation.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.144
Uh, last week
he wanted to talk
about a new girlfriend.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.580
Did you get her name?
No.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.348
His sessions were over,
I had to wait-list him.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.649
I'll call in a BOLO.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.087
You did good, real good.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.490
These guys will take
good care of you and take you
to the hospital, okay?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.794
Guy kills a patient,
tries to kill his shrink,

05:26.860 --> 05:27.928
says he's gonna
get another gun?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.530
Doesn't sound like
the end of trouble.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.998
Sounds like the start of it.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.067
You sold me a piece of crap.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.736
Jammed after a couple rounds.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.571
Zack, man, easy.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.807
I'm fixing it, okay?
This is custom work.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.443
Here, try that.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.744
Wait.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.380
How about I give you
this bump stock?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.848
Half price.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.317
400 to 800 rounds per minute,
you'll never miss a target.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.430
Range is hot.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.012
I'll take it.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.988
Zack Calnick, 27,
forklift driver.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.990
Five jobs in three years.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.859
Charged with battery,
aggravated mayhem
in the workplace,

07:05.926 --> 07:07.861
couple of restraining orders.
Real winner.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.196
Anything on that mystery
girlfriend?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.297
Nothing yet.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.066
You were good
with that shrink.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.969
Some cops, not so good at
those interpersonal things.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.772
Skills like yours,
big asset on the job.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.373
Thanks.
DISPATCHER:
Any available unit,

07:20.440 --> 07:23.343
we have a possible sighting
of 187 suspect Zack Calnick.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.912
29 La Tuna Road.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.914
Right around the corner.
50-David responding.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.320
I got it.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.463
Civilian down.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.539
24-David to Control,
we have a 187.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.040
Roll Homicide
to this location.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.542
No sign of
the suspect.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.343
Bootleg gun shop?
Ghost guns.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.378
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.281
Perfect for anybody
with a record
and on probation.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.650
I think Zack took
more than that.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.652
A bump stock's gone.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.354
Zack tries to kill his shrink,
takes out a patient

08:07.420 --> 08:08.822
and a gun dealer.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.824
And now we got a spree
killer with a machine gun.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595
Fifteen.
Ooh!

08:14.662 --> 08:16.597
See, see, see
What you gonna do
with that, Yule?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.431
YULE: Mess with it, man, but,
you know...

08:18.498 --> 08:20.267
Oh, look out, boys,
young blood Hondo's here

08:20.333 --> 08:22.435
to serve justice.
What's going on, Oz?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.037
Tell me about it.
You know I was
a Black Panther?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.372
HONDO: Yes, I do.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.574
And with much respect.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.375
Big Yule,
what's the good word, sir?

08:28.441 --> 08:29.977
The struggle is real,
young brother.

08:30.043 --> 08:33.947
Never thought that
Daniel's boy would
grow up to be a po-po.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.616
Not just a po-po,
my boy is S.W.A.T.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.150
Oh, excuse me.
Ooh, S.W.A.T.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.591
Good to see you, Pop.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.559
All right, delinquents,
make room.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.394
Don't shoot, Hondo, my
hands is up.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.896
Every time y'all get together,
throwing bones,

08:48.962 --> 08:50.330
you start thinking
you're some comedians.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.565
OZ: Easy.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.433
Hey, Pop.
Hmm?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.768
You got a second?
Why don't you sit down
and have something to eat?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.136
I'll have Sunny
bring you something sweet.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.237
I'm okay, Pop. I'm good.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.439
Hey, Sunny!
Come here, girl.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.708
Look at you...
My, my, my.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.975
You something
else today, girl.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.612
Aw, Daniel.
What do you need?

09:04.678 --> 09:06.546
Listen, why don't you bring
my boy here something sweet?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.949
This is my son. He's almost
as pretty as I am, huh?

09:11.318 --> 09:12.820
OZ: Pretty.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.122
You want flan
or tres leches cake?

09:15.188 --> 09:17.424
Sunny, I appreciate it,
but I don't have
a lot of time.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.092
He'll have the cake.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.761
Pop, come on, man, I
just came to talk to you.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.162
Is that cool?
And I asked you
to sit down

09:22.229 --> 09:23.831
and have something
to eat with me.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.333
Let's not forget
who the damn father is
and who the damn son is.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.404
Sit down.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.044
Sure, Pop.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.379
He'll have the cake.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.314
You'll enjoy it.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.050
They put cinnamon on it,
it's really good.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.417
My play, huh?

09:44.484 --> 09:45.786
OZ: Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Watch this.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.354
Ooh!

09:47.420 --> 09:48.455
YULE:
It's a big boy's game.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.556
This is a big boy's game.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.925
Wow.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.930
TAN:
Give me your hands.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.867
You good?
Yeah.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.338
Cell phones, a watch,

10:38.405 --> 10:39.673
some jewelry.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.842
Along with a crowbar
and a lockpick.
Get up.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.543
Everything but a guilty plea.
All right, he's clean.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.644
Let's go.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.614
Yo, Street, hold up.
My radio's gone.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.149
You take his radio, too?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.617
No.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.285
Must've fallen between
here and the car.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.354
Aw, man.
All right, all right.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.689
No need to panic.
Street.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.190
S.W.A.T. rule is,
you lose a piece
of police equipment,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.992
you got to hand-wash
Black Betty for a month.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.428
That's not counting
all the crap I'm gonna get
if this goes public.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.030
It must've fallen when
I jumped the fence.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.598
Babysit him,
I'll go look for it.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.441
This is Officer Jim Street.
Did you find
my partner's radio?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.278
GIRL: Uh, maybe.
What's it look like?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.380
Looks like exactly
what you're holding
in your hand right now.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.015
Can you prove it's yours?

11:22.082 --> 11:25.085
Uh,
this is Officer Victor Tan,
and this is not a game.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.653
That's police property...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.588
Come here.
...and it's a crime
not to return it.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.825
Can't talk to
Officer Victor Tan right now.
I have cheer practice.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.231
You have no idea how glad I am

11:38.298 --> 11:39.733
not to be the screw-up
right now.

11:41.735 --> 11:42.903
Come on.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.304
CORTEZ:
Sergeant Vandelli,

11:44.371 --> 11:45.572
Robbery/Homicide
will meet you

11:45.638 --> 11:46.907
at Zack Calnick's apartment
with the warrant.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.608
All right, we're
on it, Captain.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.677
DEACON:
There are a lot of benefits
for working hard in school.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.946
Showing respect for your
teachers, other classmates.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.949
And you definitely
don't want to get in trouble
and have S.W.A.T. showing up

11:56.016 --> 11:57.818
at your front door.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.520
There's an active shooter
on the loose.
You really don't need us?

12:00.587 --> 12:02.089
Vandelli's got his apartment,
and Booker's team

12:02.155 --> 12:03.490
is searching the area
he was last seen in.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.826
I need you here in case
of another emergency.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.497
Okay, who wants to see a tank?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.299
I do! I do! I do! I do!
Me, me, me!

12:12.365 --> 12:13.533
Me, me, me, me!
I do! I do! I do!

12:13.600 --> 12:15.836
Okay, come on, you guys.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.304
Let's go.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.110
Brianna's worried
about you, Pop.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.712
And I thought you and her
agreed on this move to L.A.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.615
Yeah, I can't leave
Oakland now, no.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.818
Mickey's about to
lose his corner store

12:30.884 --> 12:34.021
due to some rent increase
or something like that,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.824
some tech start
just move in and...

12:36.890 --> 12:38.491
You know, I really thought,
after all these years,

12:38.558 --> 12:40.693
you'd be done
with the struggle.
Never.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.998
Gentrification
is a conspiracy.
Besides, Mickey needs me.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.633
Mickey needs you, huh?

12:46.699 --> 12:50.037
Now wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.372
Nothing, Pop, nothing.
Look, it ain't about that.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.842
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute,
you got your chest
all puffed up

12:54.908 --> 12:56.009
like you got something to say.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.477
If you got something
to say, say it, son.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.912
Brianna's telling me
that your doctors say

12:58.979 --> 13:00.680
that you can't be living
by yourself.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.850
Oh, Brianna,
the doctors.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.485
All they doing is concerned
about getting sued.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.320
Now, what Brianna
doesn't understand

13:07.387 --> 13:10.757
is that she thinks that
Jayne is not coming back.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.425
But she's wrong.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.029
Jayne is coming back
because she don't know
what you and I got,

13:16.096 --> 13:19.232
which is that
Harrelson charm.
Oh, baby.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.468
You can't get away
from that.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.407
Pop

13:28.475 --> 13:29.509
Pop, you good?

13:29.576 --> 13:30.911
I'm fine, fine. Just got...

13:30.978 --> 13:32.712
Just got a little
chest pepper,
that's all.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.747
Just give me a second.
All right, take it easy,
but talk to me.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.916
What's going on with...
Stop, man.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.317
You're starting to sound
like your sister.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.718
I'm just saying, Pop.
I'm fine.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.889
Still with the
flip phone.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.223
It work, don't it?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.491
Hello.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.794
Oh, hey, beautiful.
How you doing?

13:47.861 --> 13:49.562
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm fine.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.333
Yeah. That's right, yeah,
he's here. Mmm-hmm.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.102
All right,
I'll tell him.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.071
Okay, see you
later. Bye now.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.207
So you got a lunch
date with Genise.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.441
Genise?
Yeah.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.542
What are you
talking about?

14:02.609 --> 14:03.977
Well, Yule said
that, uh,

14:04.044 --> 14:06.113
that you was in town
and she decided she wanted

14:06.179 --> 14:08.115
to see you, so you got
a lunch date with her.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.751
You're gonna meet her over
at the diner on Sixth.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.986
Okay? 1:00.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.554
It's a cheap place.
You ain't got to worry.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.123
Pop, come on, man.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.525
Let's just go back
to the house and talk more
about you moving to L.A.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.193
You're gonna have
lunch with Genise,

14:20.260 --> 14:21.995
and I'll get home
when I get home.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.832
Pop, you good to drive?

14:25.899 --> 14:28.101
I've been driving this baby
since before you was born.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.636
As a matter of fact,

14:29.702 --> 14:33.540
I picked you up from
the hospital in this girl.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.375
CORTEZ: Vandelli hit
our shooter's apartment,

14:35.442 --> 14:38.111
came up empty. His picture's
with every cop in the city.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.879
Any luck with
Dr. Green?

14:39.947 --> 14:42.649
Says she recalled Zack
mentioning a woman named Joy
about a month ago.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.117
That's the mystery
girlfriend, right?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.986
Not sure.
She works at Clover Syndicate.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.821
Her name is Joy Meyers.
She's on the company website.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.290
I'm sending her pic
to you right now.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.392
MUMFORD: That's the big
office complex on Vanowen.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.094
We'll swing by,
see if she knows him.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.795
Dr. Green give us
any clues on, uh,

14:55.862 --> 14:57.030
Zack's motive?
Possible targets?

14:57.097 --> 15:01.101
She says he was bipolar,
emotionally detached, angry.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.270
Let me know if you find
any useful information.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.272
Sounds like borderline
personality disorder,

15:05.338 --> 15:07.107
explains the rage.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.476
Person who craves empathy,
cannot connect with others.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.112
My new wife's
rubbing off on me.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.981
DISPATCHER:
All units, we have a call

15:14.047 --> 15:17.050
of shots fired at 269 Vanowen.
Shooter is male, white.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.419
That's Clover Syndicate.
Zack's going after Joy.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.870
Where is she?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.344
L.A.P.D. S.W.A.T.!

15:44.411 --> 15:46.980
Everybody down!
Get down!

15:49.716 --> 15:52.285
I got Zack. You find Joy.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.304
Joy Meyers. Joy.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.973
Come on, let's get
you out of here.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.383
Chris!

17:07.327 --> 17:08.695
MUMFORD:
Chris!

17:15.835 --> 17:17.637
Stay down.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.194
How much does it cost?
How fast can it go?

17:41.261 --> 17:44.464
Six figures. 85 max.
We call her Black Betty.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.133
Yeah, we use her
to chase down bad guys,

17:46.199 --> 17:47.634
which is why it's better
to be a good guy.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.035
Bad guys can drive
big trucks, too.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.303
And some still get away.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.738
Yeah, not...
Not when we're after 'em.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.374
Hey, you want
to hit the siren?

17:54.441 --> 17:55.608
All right, come on,
let's go.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.610
Matthews, take 'em
around the back.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.911
Hey, Travis.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.680
So how'd you end up getting
in so much trouble anyway?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.315
Why? 'Cause I'm
in a wheelchair?

18:02.382 --> 18:05.318
No, because your teacher
says that you could get
straight As.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.853
You know what I think?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.121
I think it's because
you want to prove

18:08.188 --> 18:09.456
that you're as tough
as the other kids.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.291
Don't have to prove it.
Travis.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.925
You don't have to act out
to make friends.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.227
You could join
an academic club.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.528
You could play basketball.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.364
Basketball?
Yeah.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.566
You'd have to get a custom
chair, but I got a buddy who
plays in a wheelchair league.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.734
Really?
Really.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.372
Okay, you hit
the siren button.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.884
Yeah, I mean, that's...
The lights are good, too,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.519
but the siren's right here.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.693
Hey, hey.
It's okay.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.094
It's no worries.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.230
Now, reading is hard.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.910
Hey, what's up?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.012
Yo, Chris,
are you all right?
Hey, you all right?

19:06.078 --> 19:08.415
I'm good, I just need to,
uh, get cleaned up.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.549
What happened?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.218
The shooter suspect
jumped her.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.986
She went after him one-on-one,
couldn't take him down.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.955
Guess her bite isn't
as big as her bark.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.432
CHRIS:
Who snitched?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.166
Deacon or Luca?
HONDO: That doesn't matter.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.569
One of my team gets hurt,
I need to be in the know.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.070
Now, how you holding up?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.905
A few bruises,
some stitches,
no... No biggie.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.006
What happened?

19:35.442 --> 19:38.478
He was stronger than me.
He got away, that simple.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.946
No cop wins
every fight, Chris.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.282
That's why we bring backup.
Now, where was Mumford?

19:42.349 --> 19:44.384
Searching the other part
of the building.

19:44.451 --> 19:48.120
But now, uh, he, uh...
He looks at me
like I'm roadkill,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.223
like I'm some
kind of liability.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.059
I know, a woman doesn't get
the same benefit of the doubt,
sometimes, when things go bad.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.728
It's not like I was ever gonna
be on Mumford's team,

19:55.795 --> 19:57.497
but at least I wanted
to hear him beg, you know?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.132
Forget Mumford.
You are a fighter, Chris.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.271
Worst part is, this guy's
looking to hurt other people,

20:04.337 --> 20:05.838
and I had a chance
to take him down.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.841
Okay, then you knuckle up
and go get
that son of a bitch.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.346
Roger that, boss.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.264
Genise Pouncey,
prettiest girl in Oakland.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.333
It's Livingston now.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.703
And, God,
I absolutely hate you.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.605
How do you look better
after all these years?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.973
Uh, it's just the way
my mama made me.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.809
Plus, I get paid to
exercise a little bit.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.446
Time to exercise is hard
to get in my house.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.916
Laundry, dishes, two kids,
full-time job.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.551
You still look
hella fine to me.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.986
So your daddy ratted me out
that I was in town, huh?

20:54.053 --> 20:55.722
No secrets in the ROMEO Club.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.457
Oh, "Retired Old Men
Eating Out."

20:57.524 --> 20:59.892
You know, that's a
hell of a long way

20:59.959 --> 21:01.193
from that Panther slogan

21:01.260 --> 21:03.630
they used to chant
back in the day.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.197
When I heard you
were gonna be here,

21:05.264 --> 21:09.969
well, I'm not usually
nostalgic, but...

21:10.036 --> 21:11.471
Thanks for coming.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.740
Yeah.
I thought maybe you
forgot all about me.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.041
Never forget your first love.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.345
How you been?

21:19.412 --> 21:20.880
Kids are good. Teenagers.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.849
James, T.J.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.051
My husband took 'em
to the movies
so we could meet up.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.119
What's he do?
Insurance.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.021
All that stuff's
on my Facebook page.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.358
You'd know it all
if you joined...
Genise, that ain't me.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.992
I don't like living
my life online.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.927
Okay, but wait a minute,
wait a minute.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.062
Teenagers, though?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.797
When did that happen?
I know.

21:37.864 --> 21:41.033
It seems like yesterday
you were visiting your dad
for the summer,

21:41.100 --> 21:43.770
sneaking me
across the bridge
to San Francisco.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.605
My girl wanted
to see fireworks
in Chinatown,

21:45.672 --> 21:47.239
and what my girl wanted,
my girl got.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.176
Still my favorite
Fourth of July.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.078
Your dad still got that '64?
Oh, yeah.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.413
That's his little baby.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.014
We were gonna drive it
down the 5 tomorrow.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.384
He's supposed to be moving in
with Brianna, but, uh,

21:57.450 --> 21:59.486
he hasn't
accepted it yet.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.488
He's sick.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.523
He can't live alone anymore.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.257
Whole ROMEO Club's got issues.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.594
My dad had
heart surgery last year.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.597
You know, I was standing next
to him today,

22:10.663 --> 22:13.966
and he... He just
seemed smaller.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.602
I mean, that
old guard,

22:15.668 --> 22:17.870
I mean, I just knew
they were gonna live forever.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.339
Too much reality.
Yeah.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.642
Even from the man who hangs
outside of helicopters.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.211
Oh, stop it, stop it.
Uh-huh. Don't think
that I didn't see that picture

22:25.277 --> 22:27.714
last year.
Okay, I did that,
I did that.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.550
But that's a lot easier
than wrangling
my hell-raising pops.

22:30.617 --> 22:31.784
Got your work cut out for you.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.052
Don't I know it.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.257
Zack and I went out
on two dates.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.993
He asked me on a third
last night,
but I wasn't interested.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.395
How did he take that?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.931
Well, he shot his shrink
this morning,
so I guess not well.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.966
Hold on, are you saying
Zack's killing people

22:47.033 --> 22:49.536
because I wouldn't
go out with him again?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.003
MUMFORD:
No, calm down, okay?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.672
Take a breath.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.375
Joy,

22:56.443 --> 22:58.445
none of this is your
fault. We're just trying

22:58.511 --> 23:00.613
to find Zack before
he hurts more people.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.914
He ever mention any family?

23:01.981 --> 23:04.383
A little.
He said it sucked
growing up with them.

23:04.451 --> 23:05.618
MUMFORD: In what
way did it suck?

23:05.685 --> 23:06.919
Did he mention
a person?

23:06.986 --> 23:08.621
A place? Does he have
a grudge against somebody?

23:08.688 --> 23:09.922
That's third date stuff.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.291
He just said his mom was mean.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.798
Chicken and waffles selfie.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.467
Luca's gonna go bananas.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.638
What? Coming here
was your idea.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.440
That was before some
girl stole my radio.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.008
Found it.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.243
You dropped it,
so she didn't really steal it.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.580
You're my partner.
You're supposed
to have my back.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.247
Dude, I'm Code 7 right now,

23:35.314 --> 23:37.884
but after that, I promise,
I'm all over it.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.823
Fine.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.424
Lunch can wait, I guess.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.859
What are you doing?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.629
Switching frequencies
from the dispatch channel.

23:49.696 --> 23:52.532
Hit the reserve tac frequency,
buy a little privacy.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.601
Hey.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.202
Hope cheer practice was good.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.670
I bet you rock those pom-poms.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.075
Tell you what.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.211
You turn over the radio,
you get a hundred bucks.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.548
GIRL: Someone already
offered me $300.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.349
Return that radio,

24:10.416 --> 24:12.852
or I am arresting you
for theft of police property.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.154
Arrest me? You don't
even know who I am.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.190
And, by the way,
I was going to let you have it
for a hundred bucks.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.559
Fine, fine.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.793
It is a deal.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.261
Forget it.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.798
Way to close, baller.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.336
Thank you.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.071
You know, I always did
like this place.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.873
They make their sandwiches
like my mom does.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.175
You always were a mama's boy.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.844
It's a good thing.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.812
How many dates
did we have here?

24:39.879 --> 24:41.447
We had some fun times.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.951
I think the reason
I wanted to see you

24:45.017 --> 24:48.721
is because I kind of
lost touch
with that teenage girl.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.857
Kind of forgot
who she was.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.258
Wanted to remember.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.492
Is that weird?

24:56.162 --> 24:59.265
She was the sexiest dancer
in all of Alameda County.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.269
She loved people.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.572
And she believed
in being good.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.507
I mean, she had no trouble
getting bad from time to time.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.142
I mean, girl,
you had some skills.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.878
Oh, shh...
I won't tell.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.582
And she made me want
to be good, too.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.085
You made me feel special.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.519
You were special.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.390
So, how you doing now?

25:24.456 --> 25:26.525
Amazing husband,
beautiful kids.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.728
Couldn't imagine
my life without them.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.829
How about you?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.064
I got my dream job.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.100
You seeing anyone?

25:35.401 --> 25:36.535
I was,

25:36.603 --> 25:39.672
but, you know, it, uh,
it got complicated...

25:42.208 --> 25:45.077
But S.W.A.T.'s enough
for me right now.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.714
Ever think the reason
you never settled down
was because of your pops?

25:49.148 --> 25:52.351
Boys look to their fathers
to lead by example.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.821
He abandoned you, your
sister, your mother.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.924
Maybe part of you worries
that you'll do the same
someday.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.659
You always did
like going deep,
didn't you

26:04.864 --> 26:06.265
Genise,

26:07.433 --> 26:09.001
the truth is,

26:11.403 --> 26:14.106
I was always closer
to my pop than I was my mom.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.744
We were tight.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.345
He was my hero.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.983
But when he left and,
you know,
disappeared on my mom,

26:24.050 --> 26:25.752
just with no warning, I...

26:26.753 --> 26:28.554
I don't know what it is.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.357
Things were just never quite
the same between him and me.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.859
I mean, I came up
for the summers,

26:32.925 --> 26:34.393
and I talked to him
on the phone, but...

26:36.162 --> 26:38.798
You think the reason
he doesn't want to move

26:38.865 --> 26:41.467
is he's embarrassed
to need you now?

26:41.533 --> 26:43.903
Think he doesn't sense
this anger you're holding
onto?

26:47.306 --> 26:49.275
It's not just anger.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.313
There's a lot of love, too.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.548
Does he know you got
both parts for him?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.417
You ever tell
him about it?

26:58.484 --> 27:00.519
You know us Harrelson men.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.554
We're hardheaded,
we're stubborn.
Yeah.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.123
But you're full of heart.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.728
He's not just sick, Hondo.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.529
He sees the end.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.231
It's happening
with my dad.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.201
He is terrified
that he's gonna be put
in an old folks home

27:15.267 --> 27:16.869
like his dad.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.139
So I'm the one
who has to be strong now.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.876
I'm the one who has to
reassure him he's not alone,

27:23.943 --> 27:27.246
even when he's not
willing to admit

27:27.313 --> 27:28.881
it all scares him to death.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.285
Me and my pops,
we just don't talk that way.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.887
Doesn't mean it can't start.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.059
I got to go.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.162
It was really good
to see you, though.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.530
Yeah.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.664
You, too.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.103
Back to reality.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.538
You take care of yourself.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.949
You know the story
about that bus stop?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.017
Story?

28:05.084 --> 28:06.252
Yeah.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.386
Found a kid there.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.587
A runaway.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.856
He was there two days.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.223
Eight years old.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.192
He ran away 'cause
his mom was mean.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.927
She hit him.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.797
He thought the bus driver
or one of the passengers
would help him.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.266
Someone would notice him,
see him hurting, and say,

28:20.332 --> 28:22.001
"Do you need help?"

28:24.837 --> 28:26.005
No one ever did.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.808
Three dollars.

28:30.509 --> 28:33.679
He stayed there all day
and night, no food,
no water, nothing.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.786
You don't have any money
or something?

28:39.852 --> 28:41.420
Nobody helped him.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.756
They all passed him by.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.725
'Cause he was bad,
just like his mother
always told him.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.236
Keep it.

29:00.606 --> 29:01.707
Hey.

29:01.774 --> 29:02.842
What happened to the kid?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.711
He became a man.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.546
The cops killed him.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.081
He died?

29:09.148 --> 29:10.249
Yeah.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.686
But not before taking out
a lot of people on that bus
first.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.965
CORTEZ:
New intel on Zack Calnick.

29:26.032 --> 29:29.101
A hot dog vendor in the Valley
heard him threaten to
kill people on a bus.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.970
There's over 2,000 buses
in this city.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.704
And hundreds of thousands
of riders.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.041
Detective Ferris is putting
out a description
to all bus drivers.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.508
Okay, how are we gonna
narrow it down?

29:36.575 --> 29:38.344
Maybe this will help.
TSA said they found

29:38.410 --> 29:40.179
Zack's abandoned car
near Burbank Airport.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.349
We focus on every bus
in or out of that airport
until we know more.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.451
Vandelli's team is chasing
a lead on the other side
of town,

29:45.517 --> 29:46.919
so I need you
to take point on this.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.587
Get moving.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.556
Why don't you sit
this one out, Alonso?
You could use a break.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.824
You know what?
She's good.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.392
Okay, I want her
watching my back.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.861
Like Luca said.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.229
I'm all in.
Mmm-hmm.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.765
All right, kids.
S.W.A.T.'s got to go
catch a bad guy.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.700
Now, listen, you're young,
you got a lot of life

30:01.767 --> 30:04.036
in front of you, so make
the right choices, all right?

30:04.103 --> 30:06.205
And you. I'm serious
about my offer.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.240
I think you'd have
a lot of fun
in that wheelchair league.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.510
Okay, see you guys.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.744
Let's do this.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.113
Yep. Let's get him.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.550
Hey, Captain.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.419
Do me a favor?
Can you keep Kelly here,

30:20.486 --> 30:22.621
just till I get back,
and have her mom come in?

30:22.688 --> 30:24.490
It's important,
I'll explain later, okay?

30:32.231 --> 30:34.566
STEVENS: Officer Tan.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.503
You didn't turn in your radio.
And I still need it.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.971
Sorry, Sarge, it's in my car.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.040
Got to move on this call, I'll
get it to you when I get back.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.308
Make sure you do.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.245
My career's being held
hostage by a cheerleader.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.948
Man, I can't take any more
of you moping around.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.517
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of this for you.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.253
I need to find
that address book.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.955
Mickey's gonna need
a pro bono.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.357
You need to pack, Pops.

30:58.424 --> 31:01.193
Come on, you need to tell me
what is coming with us,

31:01.260 --> 31:03.762
what is being donated
and what is getting
thrown out.

31:03.829 --> 31:07.066
I can't help take care of you
unless you help me
box up all of this crap,

31:07.133 --> 31:08.234
and move it and you
out of here.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.435
Where have you been?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.337
Checking up on Genise.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.441
You two really are
like peas in a pod.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.143
You said
you were gonna solve this.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.477
I am.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.747
It's time to get real, Pop.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.583
Your doctors say you
can't live alone,

31:24.650 --> 31:26.485
and your family's not here.
We're in L.A.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.020
No, I'll be fine,
as soon as Jayne gets back.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.588
Okay, just stop. Stop.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.924
Jayne ain't coming back
for you, man, wake up.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.693
Just like you ditched
Mom, Winnie, and me,
and you never came back.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.601
You know, I remember
when we were so close,

31:42.668 --> 31:43.769
water couldn't come
between us.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.673
It was just you and me.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.842
And, man, I thought I
meant everything to you.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.078
But then you left.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.346
Walked out, gone.

31:55.881 --> 31:58.150
And for a while, that made
me feel like I was nothing.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.751
Hondo...

32:00.919 --> 32:02.288
You weren't nothing, son.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.424
You were everything.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.795
My boy.

32:09.861 --> 32:13.065
I'm sorry, I can't take back
what happened to you...

32:13.132 --> 32:15.201
Me falling in love with Jayne.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.071
So, look, why don't you just
go on back to L.A.,
forget about me.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.672
I can't do that.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.842
You're my father.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.113
The only father
me and her got.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.651
I know what it is
to be left behind.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.820
But I ain't gonna
let you feel that way.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.155
Well, I'm not going.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.889
Pops, your doctor says you
can't live by yourself.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.725
I know what the doctor says!

32:39.791 --> 32:41.660
He said I'm dying.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.096
You think I don't know that?
You think I can't feel that?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.464
And I don't need
the two of you

32:45.531 --> 32:47.166
reminding me of it
all the time.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.634
It's not about you dying!

32:49.801 --> 32:51.170
It is about you living.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.105
Where Brianna and I can
come around you more.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.806
I bailed on you and Winnie.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.542
So now you got a pass.
You can bail on me.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.877
Look, son, I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry about all of it.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.246
And I will not allow myself

33:00.312 --> 33:01.413
to become a burden
on my family.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.914
You are not a burden.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.684
You are a responsibility,

33:05.751 --> 33:07.053
which is something
I learned from you

33:07.119 --> 33:08.320
for what you didn't do.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.758
But you also taught me a lot.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.628
And without it, I couldn't be
the man that I am today.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.999
Pop, please...

33:23.001 --> 33:25.304
Pack your things,

33:25.371 --> 33:27.273
because we are leaving
here as a family.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.178
And we're already late
hitting the road.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.464
L.A. Metro came through.
DEACON:
We locate Zack?

33:52.531 --> 33:53.565
Bus 254,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.167
on the Hollywood Way route.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.069
Lot of airport employees
take that line home.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.105
Why didn't this guy
start shooting as soon
as he got on the bus?

33:59.171 --> 34:00.972
FERRIS: Bus connects
to the North Hollywood
station.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.808
And hundreds more
potential casualties.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.011
Deacon, that bus is headed
for a major transit station.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.913
He's waiting for it to fill up
with more passengers.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.296
How many passengers
on the bus?
CORTEZ: Up to 14 now.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.831
DEACON:
Mapping out a diversion.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.633
Intersection of Valhalla
and Empire.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.102
Okay, we need a red-light
delay before the bus hits
the intersection.

34:30.169 --> 34:31.370
Once it stops, we'll engage.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.571
CORTEZ:
You'll need a road crew.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.005
I'll radio Public Works
to meet you there.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.982
Olivia, this is Captain Cortez
with the L.A.P.D.

34:44.049 --> 34:45.984
I need you to listen
to me very carefully

34:46.051 --> 34:48.120
and act completely
normal, okay?

34:48.187 --> 34:50.189
There's a man on your bus
who we believe

34:50.256 --> 34:52.491
is a danger to you
and your passengers.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.660
He's in the back
with the duffel bag.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.395
We have officers on the way,

34:56.462 --> 34:59.365
and if you do exactly
what I say when I say it,

34:59.431 --> 35:01.967
we can keep you and everybody
else on that bus safe.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.703
If you understand everything
I just said,

35:04.770 --> 35:06.305
say, "I'm on my way."

35:07.473 --> 35:08.874
I'm on my way.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.223
This way.
Come on through.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.557
Come on through.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.604
30-David, I have visual.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.273
Rear of the bus,
last row.

35:46.778 --> 35:47.979
He's getting up.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.882
Stay calm.
When you get to the red light,

35:50.949 --> 35:53.285
I need you to hit
the emergency override
so all doors open.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.620
I'll tell you when.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.439
30-David, bus is in position.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.840
50-David in position.

36:14.906 --> 36:15.941
On your count, Deacon.
DEACON: On my count.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.043
Three, two, one...

36:18.109 --> 36:19.245
Olivia, open the doors.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.453
Head down!
Head down!

36:27.519 --> 36:30.289
Everybody out!
Move, move, move, move! Move!

36:59.017 --> 37:01.887
MUMFORD: Alonso, hey.
Nice work out there.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.122
You came back from an early
setback and really kicked ass.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.825
Thanks.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.094
I could use that
dynamic on my team.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.229
You think, uh,

37:11.297 --> 37:14.032
I could talk you into
switching squads?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.736
Wow, this is out of the blue.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.171
I'm losing Sanderson.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.140
You'd be a higher
rank on my team.

37:24.410 --> 37:28.780
Sorry. Hard pass,
but if you're serious
about adding a woman,

37:28.847 --> 37:31.517
there's a cop named
Erica Rogers
in S.W.A.T. Academy.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.419
A real badass.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.487
And if she makes the cut,
you should check her out.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.523
Will do.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.192
Hey, Chris, hell
of a patrol day.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.662
I didn't like
how it started,

37:43.729 --> 37:45.631
and I didn't like how people
were looking at me afterwards.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.998
Well, I always had
faith in you.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.234
And anyone that didn't,
they do now.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.003
S.W.A.T. strong.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.845
Guess what I just turned down.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.647
You took down
the shooter, too.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.014
Did Mumford get on his knees
and beg you?

38:03.081 --> 38:04.215
Close.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.718
But, uh...
I did set him straight.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.887
Well, you can't blame him
for wanting the best, Chris.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.889
You know I'll want
to hear some stories
when I get back to L.A.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.558
You got it.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.126
He said his albums
are coming with, right?
Oh, hell yeah.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.228
Hey, you think you can
escort him to the museum

38:17.295 --> 38:19.164
to check out my exhibit
opening night?

38:19.230 --> 38:21.066
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.568
Any chance we can get
Winnie to show up?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.337
Not yet, Brie.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.673
Winnie's got to find
her own way with Pops.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.408
I'll ask her, but just
don't get your hopes up.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.142
She's his daughter.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.578
One day she'll crack.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.912
Yeah, I hope so.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.547
She doesn't have forever,
but I'll talk to her.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.584
Hey, don't forget
my car trophies.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.085
It's already packed.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.861
Uh, these come with me.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.965
I got this.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.147
That's a cool badge.
It's for my mom.

39:10.982 --> 39:11.983
Hi, Mom.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.084
Baby.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.953
Kelly, can you go
get your backpack?

39:20.526 --> 39:23.361
Did Kelly do
something wrong again?
LUCA: No.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.531
No, your daughter's
a good kid.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.199
I don't want to overstep,

39:28.266 --> 39:30.969
but I think
she might have dyslexia.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.238
How would you know that?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.940
Officer Luca is
familiar with the signs.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.909
Yeah, see, I'm...
I'm dyslexic, too.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.580
But I wasn't diagnosed
till I was, like, 14.

39:41.647 --> 39:44.650
Yeah, it led to a lot of anger

39:44.716 --> 39:46.084
and fights.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.153
You think Kelly is having
problems in school
because she's...

39:48.219 --> 39:49.621
I think it's worth
finding out.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.389
I mean, it's a simple test.

39:51.457 --> 39:54.392
I have two jobs.
I don't have time
or money to deal with it.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.761
Okay, if you want,
I'll take her.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.099
Hi-ya.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.771
LUCA: All right, kiddo,
no more pulling fire alarms

40:05.837 --> 40:07.573
to get out of
spelling tests.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.841
I'm gonna help you with that
reading thing, all right?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.343
Okay?
Okay.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.312
All right.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.891
So, how'd you
get her to show?

40:25.957 --> 40:29.294
Well, I told her you
were gonna lose your job.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.297
And I told her that
you were willing
to go up to 400 bucks.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.732
$400?
Shh.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.938
This is not a gift.
This is a loan.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.877
All right,
let's do this.

40:49.247 --> 40:50.482
You the girl who
stole my radio?

40:50.549 --> 40:53.351
He means found it.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.821
How does a cop even lose
his radio, anyway?

40:55.887 --> 40:57.589
That's, like,
super stupid.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.925
I was in pursuit of a suspect.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.027
He was. The world's
a safer place now.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.529
So stop torturing
the guy.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.931
Fine.
First things first.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.540
Hope you're happy.
I am a cop, not a bank.

41:14.606 --> 41:15.941
I'm gonna have to sell
some Lakers tickets

41:16.007 --> 41:17.475
that I got as a gift
to pay that off.

41:17.543 --> 41:21.713
I feel you, but now
I get to go to cheer camp,
so yay team.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.283
Schooled by a cheerleader.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.688
You better not tell anyone.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.289
That depends.

41:31.356 --> 41:32.758
You got any more
Lakers tickets?

41:42.033 --> 41:43.835
BRIANNA:
I'm ready.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.904
HONDO: All right,
you lead the way,
we'll follow.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.749
It's time to go, Pop.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.619
Yeah, I know.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.390
* Now, see the little ol'
brown-eyed girl

42:05.456 --> 42:07.092
* Hey, now

42:07.158 --> 42:11.162
* Now that you're sleeping

42:11.229 --> 42:13.231
* I've got a confession
to make

42:14.933 --> 42:17.769
* 'Bout secrets that
I've been keeping

42:19.705 --> 42:23.241
* Me and your mama
have some problems

42:23.308 --> 42:28.346
* A whole lot of things
on our minds

42:28.413 --> 42:31.116
* But lately, girl,
we been thinking

42:31.182 --> 42:33.151
* That we were wasting time

42:33.218 --> 42:35.320
* Nearly all the time

42:35.386 --> 42:39.791
* And your daddy loves you *
