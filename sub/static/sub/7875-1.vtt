WEBVTT

00:34.782 --> 00:38.077
- Francine, the meal looks delicious.
- Thank you, Klaus.

00:38.243 --> 00:41.705
I'm starting a new family tradition
of Sunday-night dinners.

00:43.123 --> 00:45.876
Wait, only four place settings?

00:46.043 --> 00:47.503
No, that's cool. That's cool.

00:47.669 --> 00:50.130
I'm supposed to hang
with my chick anyway.

00:50.297 --> 00:54.842
She's been bugging me to spend more
time with her, and she doesn't exist.

00:55.009 --> 00:56.969
Franny, I need you to run lines with me.

00:57.136 --> 00:59.430
<i>- I'm going for a part on Ghost Whisperer.
- What?</i>

00:59.597 --> 01:03.142
Oh, I didn't tell you? I'm gonna
become the greatest actor of all time.

01:03.309 --> 01:05.352
Okay, let's do this.

01:05.686 --> 01:07.814
Some say you're a ghost whisperer.

01:07.980 --> 01:12.193
If you truly are a ghost whisperer,
then you'll let me talk to my dead wife.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.321
Not now, Roger. Dinner's ready.

01:18.282 --> 01:22.286
Oh, Franny, it's so awful
the way they treat you.

01:22.453 --> 01:26.457
- I'm just trying to do something nice...
- Damn it, I still can't cry on cue.

01:26.624 --> 01:28.125
I'm gonna go work on it.

01:28.291 --> 01:31.503
What, no dinner?
You're a terrible wife and mother.

01:34.172 --> 01:38.426
Everyone ran off last week before I could
explain the point of Sunday-night dinner.

01:38.593 --> 01:40.679
Which is to reconnect as a family.

01:40.846 --> 01:44.349
And when your father gets home,
we'll do just that.

01:46.476 --> 01:50.522
Hi, I'll take a roast beef to go and
a medium Mr. Pibb, no ice. Fantastic.

01:50.689 --> 01:53.733
Stan, get inside right now
and have dinner with your family.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.029
If that's your attitude, I don't know why
you people even have a drive-through.

01:58.196 --> 02:01.199
<i>Didn't get Whisperer. Casting director's
a whore, she hates me.</i>

02:01.366 --> 02:04.368
<i>But I'm up for Medium.
The writing's more complex on this one.</i>

02:06.036 --> 02:07.663
Some say you're a medium.

02:07.830 --> 02:11.500
Well, if you truly are a medium,
then you'll let me talk to my dead wife.

02:11.667 --> 02:15.087
- Roger, not now.
- Dream-killer.

02:15.671 --> 02:17.673
Why can't I cry?

02:17.840 --> 02:20.175
Stan, the family is trying to bond...

02:20.342 --> 02:23.304
...and we would appreciate
your help. Right, kids?

02:23.470 --> 02:26.974
I can't, Jeff. I'm having stupid dinner
with my stupid family.

02:27.141 --> 02:29.310
You see, Stan?
Our family's drifting apart.

02:29.476 --> 02:32.855
All right, Francine. Just relax.
I know exactly what we need.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.316
It's time for a Smith family vacation.

02:35.482 --> 02:37.735
Yeah, we always have
the best time on vacation.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.360
Dad, can we go to Graceland?

02:39.527 --> 02:42.614
If you wanna pay respects
to a fat man who died on the toilet...

02:42.780 --> 02:44.699
...we can visit your Aunt Mary's grave.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.374
This place is amazing.
I love you all so much.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.877
Family hug.

02:56.044 --> 03:00.882
You were right, Stan. This vacation
is exactly what we needed.

03:01.049 --> 03:03.259
<i>Hello.</i>

03:03.426 --> 03:05.386
Roger?

03:08.473 --> 03:12.185
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bac-ey.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.396
Roger, what's going on?

03:16.563 --> 03:19.232
I woke you up because
I need to borrow your blue dress.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.610
I've decided to go out
for parts as a woman.

03:21.777 --> 03:25.614
<i>It came to me out of nowhere when I
was watching Tootsie last night on AMC.</i>

03:25.781 --> 03:27.449
<i>Then they showed Arachnophobia.</i>

03:27.616 --> 03:30.619
Not what I would call
an American movie "classic."

03:30.786 --> 03:33.163
No, Roger.
Why are we in these things?

03:33.330 --> 03:36.208
Oh, the goo. Yeah.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.834
Every year, Stan checks out...

03:38.001 --> 03:40.462
...these artificial-memory chambers
from the CIA...

03:40.629 --> 03:44.091
...plops you suckers in
and then programs a great vacay.

03:44.257 --> 03:48.803
This year's Maui. Sweet. Did you get me
one of those "hang loose" T-shirts?

03:48.969 --> 03:54.350
- See? Because you didn't really go.
- But if we're in here, where's Stan?

03:54.517 --> 03:55.810
Come on, Georgetown.

03:55.976 --> 03:57.311
<i>Hoyas. Hoyas.</i>

03:57.478 --> 04:00.398
<i>- Hoyas. Hoyas. Hoyas.
- Hoyas. Hoyas. Hoyas.</i>

04:03.818 --> 04:06.946
There's an old German saying,
"Don't blame the fish."

04:07.113 --> 04:11.325
There are other sayings,
but they mostly involve genocide.

04:15.538 --> 04:16.997
Let me get this straight.

04:17.164 --> 04:21.209
All of our vacations, the only thing
that ever brought this family together...

04:21.377 --> 04:23.628
...have been a big, fat, fake lie?

04:23.795 --> 04:25.380
Yes!

04:25.547 --> 04:29.300
- Yes to you and yes to the game.
- How did you get us into those vats?

04:29.467 --> 04:34.097
Well, remember how every year I cook
our annual pre-vacation pancakes?

04:34.264 --> 04:38.059
Stan, aren't you excited
to go to the GalÃ¡pagos Islands?

04:39.144 --> 04:41.312
Can't wait.

04:41.479 --> 04:43.064
Now eat up.

04:48.236 --> 04:52.115
<i>Then I gingerly carry your bodies
downstairs...</i>

04:52.282 --> 04:54.159
<i>... strip you down,
put you in the goo...</i>

04:54.325 --> 04:56.703
<i>... and program the greatest
family vacation ever.</i>

04:58.246 --> 05:00.164
So in Mexico when
I went hang-gliding...

05:00.330 --> 05:03.959
...and you told me you loved me...?
- Neither of those things ever happened.

05:04.126 --> 05:05.544
Why do this?

05:05.711 --> 05:07.462
I wanted you
to have good memories...

05:07.629 --> 05:10.757
...but my idea of a vacation
is a vacation away from you people.

05:10.924 --> 05:12.301
That's terrible.

05:12.467 --> 05:16.430
Stan, we are going on a real vacation
and this family is going to bond.

05:16.597 --> 05:19.683
- We could go skiing.
- Or, here's an alternate pitch.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.393
Stay here, watch the Duke game...

05:21.560 --> 05:23.937
Just hear me out.
I order boneless wings from KFC.

05:24.104 --> 05:25.606
- But...
- Hang on to that thought.

05:25.772 --> 05:28.317
I take a long bath and then...
Wait for it.

05:28.483 --> 05:29.902
- None of you are here.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.570
Or... Just hear me out.

05:31.737 --> 05:34.363
We stay home,
and for the rest of our lives together...

05:34.530 --> 05:37.909
...every time you doze off,
I slam a book on your testicles.

05:38.492 --> 05:40.369
Did someone say skiing?

05:40.536 --> 05:42.872
Yes. I did.

05:48.544 --> 05:51.672
I'm so nervous.
This is my first soap opera audition.

05:51.839 --> 05:53.507
Oh, my God, I didn't see you there.

05:53.674 --> 05:56.385
You make absolutely
no impression at all.

05:56.552 --> 05:59.847
Betty Bea Getty McClanahan,
we're ready for you.

06:00.014 --> 06:02.224
- Good luck.
- Oh! Oh, you did it again.

06:02.391 --> 06:06.395
Darling, I swear, put a bell
around your neck or something.

06:06.562 --> 06:09.648
Yes, Mr. Sureshow,
I may have left Sunrise Valley a girl...

06:09.814 --> 06:13.193
...but I can assure you,
I return a confident, sexy woman...

06:13.360 --> 06:16.613
...who can shoe a horse
and please her man.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.407
Yes! We have found our Miss Fiona.

06:19.574 --> 06:23.662
My dream has come true.
You humble me. I am humbled.

06:23.828 --> 06:25.455
Excuse me.

06:25.622 --> 06:28.124
Go home, bitches. Show's over.
I nailed it.

06:32.462 --> 06:35.298
What a day. Perfect powder,
the slopes were empty.

06:35.465 --> 06:38.218
Family hug.

06:38.927 --> 06:42.430
Sorry, I need this outlet to plug in
the "Tempest" machine I got on eBay.

06:42.597 --> 06:45.432
- Stan!
- I didn't do this. Where's Steve?

06:45.599 --> 06:47.976
Don't get me wrong,
I like the Berenstain Bears.

06:48.143 --> 06:50.771
I just wouldn't want one of them
marrying my daughter.

06:50.938 --> 06:52.731
- Indeed.
- Steve!

06:52.898 --> 06:54.983
How could you put us in the goo?

06:55.150 --> 06:58.821
Dad had the right idea.
I need time away from you people too.

06:58.987 --> 07:03.033
Okay, enough of this. Clearly,
the men in this house can't be trusted.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.413
Hayley, come on.
You and I are gonna plan a real trip.

07:07.579 --> 07:11.083
- You undressed me?
- Oh, no. Toshi did.

07:16.046 --> 07:20.049
- It's so hot, Brock.
- Oh, you'll get used to it, Miss Fiona.

07:20.216 --> 07:23.511
Will I? I'm pregnant. Pregnant!

07:25.888 --> 07:28.724
- Cut.
- What the hell, Jerry?

07:28.891 --> 07:31.144
I need you to make the crying
more convincing.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.396
You think I can't cry? I can cry.

07:33.563 --> 07:35.731
I cried when I read this dreck.
Who wrote it?

07:35.898 --> 07:38.192
An illiterate Irishman's Polish monkey?

07:38.359 --> 07:40.444
- I did.
- I quit.

07:40.611 --> 07:44.615
If you quit, I'll see to it
you never work in this town again.

07:44.782 --> 07:47.660
Let me explain something to you
about show business, Jerry.

07:47.827 --> 07:51.289
It's a business.
And I am the greatest actor of all time.

07:51.455 --> 07:53.583
- What's your name?
- Parker.

07:53.749 --> 07:56.459
Lunch was late today.

07:59.546 --> 08:03.758
"Attach stabilizing-rod B
to ankle-constraint A"?

08:03.925 --> 08:06.428
We should've just paid the guy
to put this together.

08:06.595 --> 08:08.471
Hayley!

08:08.638 --> 08:11.057
I can't believe you put us in the goo.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.227
What? We planned to go to Italy,
so I sent you to Italy.

08:14.394 --> 08:18.899
You're missing the point. All I wanted
was to have dinner once in a while...

08:19.065 --> 08:20.942
...and spend some real time together.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.278
But you know what? I'm done. Done.

08:23.445 --> 08:27.032
And you know why?
Because you are an ass family.

08:27.199 --> 08:30.492
If someone asked me who lived
in this house, I'd say the Asses.

08:30.659 --> 08:33.453
And I'd be right. I just...

08:33.621 --> 08:36.789
I don't know why it has to... l...

08:40.794 --> 08:44.131
Hey Mr. S, you wanna help
strap me into this thing?

08:46.717 --> 08:48.969
Francine, you were right.
We've been horrible.

08:49.136 --> 08:51.805
- But we're gonna make it up to you.
- We booked a cruise.

08:51.972 --> 08:54.808
- We leave in an hour.
- You're just gonna put me in the goo.

08:54.975 --> 08:56.936
No, we're not. Honey, look.

08:57.102 --> 08:59.521
I'm returning the goo chambers
to the CIA.

08:59.688 --> 09:03.943
Ma'am, don't get any of that goo
on you. It'll rot out your womb.

09:04.109 --> 09:07.695
Oh, my God. We are going
on a real vacation.

09:07.862 --> 09:12.033
The only goo you're gonna see
is goo-od times.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.452
It was a stretch,
but I made it work, didn't I?

09:14.619 --> 09:16.454
- No.
- That's right.

09:24.879 --> 09:29.717
Remember, the winning family
gets 100 cruise points, no cash value.

09:29.884 --> 09:33.304
I want those valueless cruise points.

09:35.014 --> 09:37.392
- Smiths win.
- Yes!

09:37.558 --> 09:40.227
I'm gonna go sign us up
for face-painting class.

09:40.394 --> 09:43.980
Steve, you're gonna be a rabbit.
Hayley, you're gonna be a squirrel.

09:44.147 --> 09:46.942
And I'm gonna be a panda.

09:48.860 --> 09:53.365
- I can't take this cruise any more.
- I'll tell you something. I am at my limit.

09:53.532 --> 09:56.159
Here is the line
and here's face-painting, okay?

09:56.326 --> 09:58.120
Yeah, yeah, try and paint my face.

09:58.286 --> 10:00.288
Come at me with a brush,
see what happens.

10:00.455 --> 10:02.582
- I miss the goo.
- I know this is torture.

10:02.749 --> 10:06.253
But we owe it to your mother to pretend
to have a great time as a family.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.213
- So let's turn it up a notch.
- Okay.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.549
- Fine.
- Come on, Hayley, let's go to the bar.

10:10.715 --> 10:14.302
Steve, you stay here
and cool off with a charley horse.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.723
Hi, I'm Becky,
cruise activities director.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.101
I'm Steve.
I have five friends on MySpace...

10:22.268 --> 10:24.437
...and I'm awaiting approval
from a sixth.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.605
- You're cute.
- Oh, in a harmless...

10:26.772 --> 10:28.566
...little brother kind of way, right?

10:28.732 --> 10:31.110
No, in an
I've-taken-a-lot-of-boys'-virginity...

10:31.277 --> 10:32.945
...kind of way.

10:40.995 --> 10:44.123
- What a day for our family.
- Family.

10:44.290 --> 10:46.709
You guys sure are having a good time.

10:46.876 --> 10:50.670
Of course we are. That's what families
do. They have good times. To family!

10:50.837 --> 10:53.882
- Family!
- Francine, guess what tonight is.

10:54.048 --> 10:56.134
Sunday. We're about to finally have...

10:56.301 --> 10:58.720
...that special Sunday-night dinner
you wanted.

10:58.887 --> 11:01.055
Hi, Steve. Wanna introduce me
to your family?

11:01.222 --> 11:03.099
Family!

11:03.266 --> 11:06.644
- Why didn't you do it that time?
- I thought we were done with it.

11:07.270 --> 11:10.023
Hey, everyone, this is Becky.
She works on the boat.

11:10.190 --> 11:12.775
Your son is 14, going on me.

11:12.942 --> 11:14.819
Okay, something's not right here.

11:14.986 --> 11:18.114
You're all too happy,
you keep yelling "family."

11:18.281 --> 11:19.866
Family!

11:20.033 --> 11:22.076
How's it feel? Not so good?

11:22.243 --> 11:24.746
And now a thin girl is crazy for Steve?

11:24.912 --> 11:28.165
I don't buy it. You put me
in the goo again.

11:28.332 --> 11:31.376
Francine, I swear on the lives
of our future grandchildren...

11:31.543 --> 11:34.254
...that only Steve will be able
to give us, this is real.

11:34.421 --> 11:38.175
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Fantastic Cruises Dinner Theater...</i>

11:38.342 --> 11:41.678
<i>... proudly presents some poor soul
on the downswing of their career...</i>

11:41.845 --> 11:45.641
<i>... doing a tribute
to Olivia Newton-John.</i>

11:46.433 --> 11:49.561
<i>Xanadu</i>

11:49.728 --> 11:52.856
<i>Can 't cry on cue</i>

11:53.023 --> 11:57.444
<i>Now I am here in Xanadu</i>

11:57.611 --> 11:59.112
Ma'am, I talked to the chef.

11:59.279 --> 12:01.447
There's no cream in the soup,
like you asked.

12:01.614 --> 12:03.032
<i>Xanadu</i>

12:03.199 --> 12:07.495
Roger's playing Olivia Newton-John
on our cruise ship?

12:07.662 --> 12:10.373
Oh, this has goo written all over it.

12:10.539 --> 12:14.085
Honey, no. You saw them take those
machines away. I promise, this is real.

12:14.251 --> 12:18.673
Oh, yeah? Well if it's real,
then I probably shouldn't do this.

12:20.633 --> 12:24.011
I'm sorry, sir. She thinks
she's in the goo. Francine, come back.

12:30.351 --> 12:31.894
Mom, get down from there.

12:32.061 --> 12:34.897
I'll see you all in the living room
in a minute.

12:35.730 --> 12:39.484
I'm in the goo.

12:40.985 --> 12:45.323
You're not in the goo.
And you have the room key.

12:49.911 --> 12:51.955
Becky, thanks for getting us
this lifeboat.

12:52.122 --> 12:55.875
I mean, lifeboobs.
Wait. No, no, I was right.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.294
Stan!

13:01.047 --> 13:03.717
Oh, Francine, thank God you're okay.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.971
You know, while I was out there,
I made a promise to God.

13:08.138 --> 13:12.307
I said if he saved me,
I'd dedicate my life to him.

13:12.474 --> 13:16.478
Obviously, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm starved. Did you bring any food?

13:16.645 --> 13:18.856
Didn't need to.
The ship's got plenty of food.

13:19.022 --> 13:21.275
Oh, so you told the ship
to come back for us?

13:22.651 --> 13:24.778
Yeah, that would've been the call.

13:24.945 --> 13:26.989
I'm sure Roger
will get them to come back.

13:29.116 --> 13:33.036
- How dare you treat a lady like this?
- We caught you stealing silverware.

13:33.203 --> 13:36.081
I did nothing of the kind.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.917
Okay, okay, I took your silverware.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.795
But in fairness, you ran out
of the mango shrimp salad...

13:41.962 --> 13:43.213
...two brunches in a row.

13:43.380 --> 13:47.300
So who's the real thief here?
Both. Both of us.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.846
You seem to be in distress.

13:52.013 --> 13:53.806
I just can't catch a break.

13:53.973 --> 13:55.892
And I don't have any money
to get home.

13:56.058 --> 13:59.395
You know, I'm an actress.
And I'm amazing.

13:59.562 --> 14:02.815
Really? My cousin runs
a small performance space.

14:02.982 --> 14:05.109
- Perhaps he could use you.
- Oh, the theater.

14:05.276 --> 14:09.155
That's where I cut my teeth.
Trotting the boards with Phil.

14:09.322 --> 14:12.074
Seymour Hoffman.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.876
<i>Oh, Equus.</i>

14:29.507 --> 14:31.593
We haven't eaten in four days.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.471
Damn it, why couldn't you
jump off the boat after dinner?

14:34.638 --> 14:38.475
This isn't my fault. I just wanted us
to spend some time together.

14:38.642 --> 14:40.018
Steve's hiding food.

14:40.185 --> 14:42.604
No, it's just a picture
I took with some grapes.

14:42.771 --> 14:45.857
- Give it to me.
- Share it, you have to share it.

14:46.983 --> 14:50.320
No! What are we gonna do
for pictures of food now?

14:50.487 --> 14:51.863
Look.

14:55.075 --> 14:57.493
A house. We're saved.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.328
I'm gonna check out the situation.

14:59.495 --> 15:03.374
And you guys can check out my ass
as I walk away. I think you'll be pleased.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.338
- Yeah, hi. We landed on your beach.
- They better have food up there.

15:09.505 --> 15:12.591
If they have any chocolate sauce,
I'll let you lick it off me.

15:12.758 --> 15:15.469
On, no thanks. My mom doesn't like me
to eat chocolate.

15:15.636 --> 15:18.514
But maybe some nice carob paste
or some hummus.

15:19.098 --> 15:20.140
Okay, here's the deal.

15:20.307 --> 15:22.017
- They're gonna hunt us.
- What?

15:22.184 --> 15:24.061
The guy said we had
a 20-minute start.

15:24.228 --> 15:26.105
Then they're gonna
hunt us like animals.

15:26.271 --> 15:27.481
That doesn't sound right.

15:27.648 --> 15:30.900
Yeah, now that I said it out loud,
it does sound a little strange.

15:31.067 --> 15:33.486
I'm gonna go see what's going on.

15:35.863 --> 15:37.865
Hi, I'm Francine.

15:38.032 --> 15:40.618
My husband seems to think that...

15:40.785 --> 15:43.579
...you were gonna hunt us down
like animals.

15:43.746 --> 15:45.415
Yep.

15:50.962 --> 15:52.755
Okay, then.

15:52.922 --> 15:55.925
Look, that cloud looks like
one of those old-fashioned phones.

15:56.092 --> 15:59.887
Yeah, and that string of clouds
next to it looks like the cord.

16:00.054 --> 16:02.515
That's a good addition.
It does look like the cord.

16:02.682 --> 16:05.892
- Good contribution.
- It's real! It's real! Get out of my way!

16:44.138 --> 16:46.557
- I'm exhausted.
- I'm starving.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.726
Steve has a charley horse.

16:49.935 --> 16:52.188
We should all
spend the night here and rest.

16:52.688 --> 16:57.067
Mr. Smith, you light a fire and I'll catch
rainwater with one of these plant leaves.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.113
Becky!

17:05.451 --> 17:07.328
- She's gone.
- No!

17:07.494 --> 17:09.288
- We're trapped.
- I'll get us out.

17:11.832 --> 17:13.375
I'm too weak from hunger.

17:13.541 --> 17:16.627
I used my last bit of energy
giving Steve that charley horse.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.172
- Worth it.
- We are gonna die in here.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.258
I can't believe starving to death
is how I'm going out.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.801
I thought for sure
I'd shoot myself in my study.

17:24.969 --> 17:27.222
Stop it. No one is gonna die.

17:27.387 --> 17:30.683
Mom, there's no way out and there's
nothing in this cave we can eat.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.187
Actually, there is one thing.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.525
- Good Lord, Francine.
- Oh, my God, Mom! That's disgusting.

17:38.691 --> 17:43.112
Of course it is. But I'm not gonna stand
by and watch my family perish.

17:43.279 --> 17:46.366
This is our first
real vacation we've taken together...

17:46.532 --> 17:50.328
...and it sure as hell is not gonna be
the last. Now who's with me?

17:50.495 --> 17:54.498
Francine, you've clearly gone insane.
I'm not even gonna entertain that idea.

17:54.665 --> 17:56.667
You wanna play 20 questions
until we die?

17:56.833 --> 17:57.918
I'm thinking of a person.

17:58.085 --> 17:59.503
- Ronald Reagan.
- Damn.

18:04.675 --> 18:07.719
Is this a nickel?
Someone threw a nickel.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.179
Cold.

18:09.763 --> 18:11.223
Eddy, what's become of me?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.767
I was gonna be
the greatest actor of all time.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.727
But instead, I've hit rock bottom.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.772
Actually, this is the bottom.

18:21.149 --> 18:25.529
Meet SeÃ±or Hidalgo. You will be having
unpleasant sex with him tonight.

18:25.696 --> 18:28.906
What? Oh, my God.
This can't be happening.

18:29.073 --> 18:30.283
What am I doing here?

18:30.449 --> 18:33.786
I miss my house, I miss my family.
I just wanna go home.

18:33.953 --> 18:36.414
I just wanna close my eyes and,
when I open them...

18:36.580 --> 18:38.165
...I'll be home, okay?

18:38.332 --> 18:41.752
SeÃ±orita, no, no. Do not cry.

18:41.919 --> 18:44.630
Never before have I been so moved.

18:44.797 --> 18:49.719
Here, take this money. Go.
Go, start a new life for yourself...

18:49.885 --> 18:53.472
...far away from this place
and my indiscriminate boner.

18:53.639 --> 18:57.810
Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir.
Bless you. Bless you.

18:59.145 --> 19:02.188
I did it. I can finally cry on cue.

19:02.355 --> 19:04.983
I truly am
the greatest actor of all time.

19:05.150 --> 19:08.111
Oh, thank God I'm out of that jam.

19:08.445 --> 19:10.196
Gonna be a long trip home.

19:10.363 --> 19:13.324
Maybe I'll just stop in here
for a little drink.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.377
Okay, that's it. Let's do it.
Let's eat her.

19:24.544 --> 19:26.796
- Steve!
- Stan, he's choosing life.

19:26.963 --> 19:29.674
- There's no shame in that.
- Hayley!

19:29.841 --> 19:32.552
I've eaten macrobiotic burritos.
I can eat this.

19:32.719 --> 19:35.930
Stan, we either do this
as a family or not at all.

19:36.097 --> 19:38.891
No! Don't you get it?
She's a human being.

19:39.057 --> 19:40.809
A human being with a name.

19:40.976 --> 19:45.105
Becky Arangino. She's from Seattle.
She's 5-foot-4. She's...

19:45.272 --> 19:47.941
...an organ donor.

19:52.154 --> 19:55.824
Okay, I'll say it.
I'll say what we're all thinking.

19:55.991 --> 19:58.535
We ate a person. We did.

19:58.702 --> 20:04.750
But I'll say another thing. It's Sunday
night and we finally had a family dinner.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.586
And you know what? It was nice.

20:07.753 --> 20:09.213
Ready.

20:27.939 --> 20:31.234
- It's paint.
- Awesome!

20:31.400 --> 20:33.611
Yeah. Red team wins.

20:33.778 --> 20:35.905
- We're not dead.
- Of course not.

20:36.072 --> 20:40.826
No one dies here at Jimmy Buffet's
Most Dangerous Game Family Retreat.

20:44.997 --> 20:48.291
Man, it took us two days to find you.
You must be starving.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.585
Hey, weren't there five of you?

20:51.253 --> 20:57.050
Well, nothing bonds a family
like a dark, horrible secret.

20:57.217 --> 21:00.303
So where do you guys
wanna go next year?

21:04.474 --> 21:07.769
- To the goo.
- To the goo!

21:49.852 --> 21:51.937
