00:02.359 --> 00:04.427
? ?

00:07.331 --> 00:09.498
Psst. In here!

00:13.938 --> 00:16.873
I'm safe.
Not quite.

00:16.874 --> 00:19.709
The amulet, please,
Mr. Stinson.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.114
Why?

00:26.250 --> 00:28.751
Help! Help!
The kid.

00:33.958 --> 00:36.192
Help!
Hang on, kid.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.539 --> 00:51.374
Grab my tie.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.609
But you're not supposed
to take the tie off.

00:53.610 --> 00:56.112
You lost a bet with your
friends Lily and Marshall

00:56.113 --> 00:58.714
which requires you to wear
the tie for a full year.

00:58.715 --> 01:02.318
If it means saving your life,
I think they'll understand!

01:02.319 --> 01:03.887
They sound like nice people!

01:03.888 --> 01:04.921
Yeah, they are.

01:04.922 --> 01:06.923
Grab that...

01:09.126 --> 01:10.659
Come on.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.428
That's it.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.167
Thanks, Mister.

01:18.168 --> 01:19.682
How can I repay you?

01:19.802 --> 01:22.505
You can stay in school,
that's how.

01:24.474 --> 01:26.776
No!

01:26.777 --> 01:27.810
True story.

01:27.811 --> 01:29.612
But golly, I'm just gonna miss

01:29.613 --> 01:32.315
the heck out of
that ducky tie. I really am.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.351
Look what I just found
in the trash.

01:35.352 --> 01:37.553
No!

<i>Kids, you haven't truly
lived until somewhere,</i>

01:58.377 --> 02:00.787
<i>somebody puts a sign up because
of something you did.</i>

02:00.907 --> 02:01.824
<i>For instance...</i>

02:01.825 --> 02:03.869
Have you guys seen that sign
out front that says

02:03.989 --> 02:05.717
"Absolutely No
Boogie-Boarding"?

02:05.837 --> 02:07.370
What's that all about?

02:07.371 --> 02:09.872
Oh, that's a great story.
You got time for it?

02:09.874 --> 02:13.810
Well, I'm supposed to go to
my mom's birthday party, so...

02:13.811 --> 02:16.012
please make it as
long as you can.

02:16.013 --> 02:18.081
Well, it happened
a few months ago.

02:18.082 --> 02:19.883
The night of the hurricane...

02:19.884 --> 02:22.252
<i>Kids, it was August 26, 2011,</i>

02:22.253 --> 02:25.922
<i>and Hurricane Irene was
barreling towards New York.</i>

02:25.923 --> 02:27.790
Guys, guys, guys.

02:27.791 --> 02:29.492
This storm is serious.

02:29.493 --> 02:31.761
Luckily, you are friends
with a former Boy Scout.

02:31.762 --> 02:33.196
And a Boy Scout is always what?

02:33.197 --> 02:34.464
Unpopular?
Beaten up?

02:34.465 --> 02:35.765
Going to the movies
with his mom?

02:35.766 --> 02:37.633
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

02:37.634 --> 02:39.469
Prepared to spend lunch
in his locker?

02:39.470 --> 02:40.703
Prepared to die a virgin?

02:40.704 --> 02:42.105
Prepared to paint
his sister's nails?

02:42.106 --> 02:44.007
Prepared for emergencies!

02:44.008 --> 02:45.441
That's why a week ago,

02:45.442 --> 02:47.244
when Irene was just
a tropical depression-

02:47.245 --> 02:49.112
You're a tropical depression.

02:49.113 --> 02:50.947
This guy got us...

02:50.948 --> 02:52.749
a disaster backpack,

02:52.750 --> 02:55.551
and a rental car that seats
five, parked right outside.

02:55.552 --> 02:57.320
We're gonna drive up
to my place in Westchester

02:57.321 --> 02:58.488
where we'll all be safe.

02:58.489 --> 03:00.290
Boy Scouted!
You're welcome.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.624
Ted's right, we should go.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.126
Hey, on the way out of the city,

03:03.127 --> 03:05.628
do you mind if we stop at my
place so I can get something?

03:07.598 --> 03:09.499
Okay, what did you have to get?

03:09.500 --> 03:12.535
My drink on.
We're not going anywhere.

03:12.536 --> 03:14.004
What? No!

03:14.005 --> 03:16.172
We don't have time for this!
We gotta get going!

03:16.173 --> 03:18.141
Ted, I'm older than you.
Yeah.

03:18.142 --> 03:19.409
And taller.
Just older.

03:19.410 --> 03:21.278
And when you reach my age,
and height,

03:21.279 --> 03:23.613
you'll see that things like this
hurricane are no big deal.

03:23.614 --> 03:25.215
They're going to close
the bridges.

03:25.216 --> 03:27.417
You guys, we got
to get out of here.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.452
I'm afraid I'm with
blondie on this one.

03:29.453 --> 03:31.388
This storm is nothing.
I'm from Vancouver.

03:31.389 --> 03:33.256
You know what we call
this in the Couv?

03:33.257 --> 03:34.791
Barbecue weather.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.960
Yeah, I'm with these guys.

03:36.961 --> 03:39.396
Drinking beer in front
of Barney's giant TV

03:39.397 --> 03:40.863
beats sitting in the car

03:40.864 --> 03:42.165
<i>listening to
Memoires of a Geisha.</i>

03:42.166 --> 03:44.600
Come on, we're at the best part.

03:44.601 --> 03:47.971
Oh, it's my mom,
checking to see if I'm okay.

03:47.972 --> 03:49.372
Hey, Mom.

03:49.373 --> 03:51.808
Ooh, Mommy!
It's dwizzling out!

03:51.809 --> 03:53.609
I'm so scared!

03:53.610 --> 03:54.844
Bikini weather.

03:54.845 --> 03:56.813
Marshall, you're with me, right?

03:56.814 --> 03:59.482
Sorry, old friend.

03:59.483 --> 04:02.385
But I can't afford
to tempt fate.

04:03.454 --> 04:05.721
Oh right, I was being
really weird.

04:05.722 --> 04:07.157
I should explain.

04:07.158 --> 04:08.724
Last summer I quit my job.

04:08.725 --> 04:10.526
And then, a week before
the hurricane...

04:10.527 --> 04:14.965
Huh, my medical
insurance just expired.

04:14.966 --> 04:18.634
That gives me two uninsured weeks
before I'm added to your plan.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.236
It's no biggie.

04:20.237 --> 04:22.572
Ow!
Paper cut.

04:23.507 --> 04:28.578
Death is all around us.

04:28.579 --> 04:30.613
So for the next two weeks

04:30.614 --> 04:33.749
he was basically a really
clingy Edgar Allan Poe.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.853
The Grim Reaper beckons.

04:36.854 --> 04:41.591
I feel his icy grip
around my throat,

04:41.592 --> 04:44.094
the breath of his hounds
at my heels,

04:44.095 --> 04:50.700
the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of
his scythe on my chamber door.

04:50.701 --> 04:53.836
And you, with your
blithe request,

04:53.837 --> 04:56.206
you only hasten
his inevitable triumph.

04:56.207 --> 04:58.375
Is that what you desire?

04:58.376 --> 05:00.543
Is that what you desire, Lily?

05:00.544 --> 05:03.346
I just wanted you
to get us some bagels.

05:03.347 --> 05:05.315
Bagels?!

05:05.316 --> 05:08.684
Do you have any idea

05:08.685 --> 05:12.088
what could happen to me
whilst getting bagels?!

05:18.362 --> 05:21.697
What the...?!
No, not like this!

05:21.698 --> 05:23.566
Fine. I'll go get the bagels.

05:23.567 --> 05:24.800
No!

05:24.801 --> 05:26.202
Why not?

05:26.203 --> 05:28.238
And remember, not too
much cream cheese.

05:28.239 --> 05:30.206
Half a shmear, max.

05:30.207 --> 05:33.043
Thanks, baby.

05:34.478 --> 05:37.747
No! No! Not like this!

05:37.748 --> 05:40.216
Okay, now you're just
being ridiculous.

05:40.217 --> 05:42.085
Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!

05:42.086 --> 05:44.620
People get run over by buses

05:44.621 --> 05:47.657
and hit in the nuts by
skateboards, bitten by babies.

05:47.658 --> 05:49.959
Nobody wakes up and says,
"Today I'm gonna star

05:49.960 --> 05:51.261
in a YouTube video."

05:51.262 --> 05:53.396
You've said that at
least a dozen times.

05:53.397 --> 05:56.332
Lily, for the next two weeks

05:56.333 --> 05:59.735
you must be by my side
protecting me.

05:59.736 --> 06:01.771
Why, what's gonna happen?

06:01.772 --> 06:04.941
Answer: a hurricane.

06:04.942 --> 06:06.976
Just let me take off the tie!
Please!

06:06.977 --> 06:08.978
I have to wear this at work.

06:08.979 --> 06:11.314
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

06:11.315 --> 06:15.285
If the SEC pursues charges,
it's going to be all our asses.

06:15.286 --> 06:19.589
Nobody takes this
more seriously than I do.

06:19.590 --> 06:22.492
Please, can I take it off?

06:22.493 --> 06:27.363
You... may... knot.

06:27.364 --> 06:29.099
With a "K."

06:29.100 --> 06:30.833
A little tie pun.

06:30.834 --> 06:32.602
This is far from over.

06:32.603 --> 06:36.406
You have a price, Eriksen,
and I will find it.

06:36.407 --> 06:41.711
When the end of day is nigh,
I'll have taken off this tie.

06:41.712 --> 06:45.548
I'm going to like the way
I look, I guarantee it.

06:47.184 --> 06:48.618
So boogie-boarding...

06:48.619 --> 06:50.886
Boogie-boarding. So I was trying
to get these guys to leave.

06:50.887 --> 06:52.888
Hey, Nerdlinger,

06:52.889 --> 06:54.524
what's with the safety boner?

06:54.525 --> 06:55.958
I mean, come on.

06:55.959 --> 06:59.129
The disaster kit, the car,
the ladies' rain boots-

06:59.130 --> 07:00.896
Uh, they're men's.

07:00.897 --> 07:03.666
Pink is just easier to
spot from the rescue chopper.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.035
Look, forgive me for caring
about you guys,

07:06.036 --> 07:07.703
but you're my best friends
in the world

07:07.704 --> 07:09.572
and I just want to make sure
you're okay.

07:09.573 --> 07:14.844
Ah. Ted, you are
a giant whining bummer.

07:14.845 --> 07:15.811
Barney...

07:15.812 --> 07:16.912
Come on, Ted,

07:16.913 --> 07:20.216
this storm is not a big deal.

07:20.217 --> 07:22.385
This storm is a big deal.

07:22.386 --> 07:23.853
Let's replay
that harrowing footage

07:23.854 --> 07:25.655
of Irene touching
down in North Carolina.

07:30.994 --> 07:32.895
We gotta get out of here!

07:32.896 --> 07:35.031
Go, go! Come on,
come on!

07:37.329 --> 07:38.870
Please let me take it off!
No.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.478
$5,000?
No.

07:40.598 --> 07:41.285
Is he serious?

07:41.386 --> 07:42.419
$10,000?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.787
No.
Dudes, take the money.

07:43.788 --> 07:45.189
$20,000?
No.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.157
Yes. I'll let you slap me in the face

07:47.158 --> 07:49.059
as hard as you can.
You have my attention.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.561
<i>Kids, you remember Marshall
and Barney's slap bet.</i>

07:51.562 --> 07:54.464
<i>A few years earlier,
Barney lost a bet to Marshall.</i>

07:54.465 --> 07:58.202
<i>His penalty was five slaps
delivered anyplace, anytime.</i>

07:58.203 --> 08:01.471
<i>So far, Marshall had slapped
Barney four times.</i>

08:01.472 --> 08:03.507
<i>Which meant he only had
one slap left.</i>

08:03.508 --> 08:05.542
What do you say, Marshall?

08:05.543 --> 08:08.345
Are you going to seize
this slap-ortunity

08:08.346 --> 08:10.247
or let it slap
through your fingers?

08:10.248 --> 08:12.149
Don't let him
tempt you, Marshall.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.019
I don't know, Lily. I mean
we have a baby on the way.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.654
An extra slap could
really come in handy.

08:17.655 --> 08:18.956
No! No!

08:18.957 --> 08:21.058
This is crazy.

08:21.059 --> 08:24.295
You having to wear that tie
for another ten months

08:24.296 --> 08:26.163
is all the satisfaction I need.

08:26.164 --> 08:27.398
Plus,

08:27.399 --> 08:29.199
I still have one slap left,

08:29.200 --> 08:32.602
and that feels good. But if
you didn't have that slap left-

08:32.602 --> 08:36.373
if say, I were to get you
to slap me tonight-

08:36.374 --> 08:39.275
I suppose that
would change everything.

08:40.211 --> 08:42.846
I suppose it would.

08:44.282 --> 08:48.052
<i>Le jeu commence.</i>

08:48.053 --> 08:53.023
<i>Je m'appelle Marshall.</i>

08:54.892 --> 08:56.827
So boogie-boarding...
Boogie-boarding.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.628
So I was trying to get
these guys to leave,

08:58.629 --> 09:00.030
but there was
one little problem.

09:00.031 --> 09:01.298
Come on, let's go.

09:01.299 --> 09:02.399
I'm staying.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.201
What?!
Barney?!

09:04.202 --> 09:06.070
Hey, hey, it's going to get
pretty crazy out there.

09:06.071 --> 09:08.138
And if some hot woman gets
all her clothes blown off,

09:08.139 --> 09:09.639
and I'm not up here
to videotape it

09:09.640 --> 09:11.508
and put it up on the Internet,
who will, FEMA?

09:11.509 --> 09:12.843
Come on, open your eyes.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.544
No, no, you are coming with us.

09:14.545 --> 09:17.781
We leave no man behind.

09:17.782 --> 09:19.383
Hey, Mom.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.986
Uh, yeah, the boots
were a big hit.

09:23.554 --> 09:24.989
You know, I better pee.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.157
But when Lily and I get back,
we're all leaving.

09:27.158 --> 09:28.859
Wait, I have to go
pee with you?

09:28.860 --> 09:31.362
You want me to go
to the "bathroom,"

09:31.363 --> 09:34.798
the most dangerous room
in the house by myself?

09:34.799 --> 09:36.933
Do you have any idea
what could happen?

09:38.169 --> 09:40.871
Ow! My eye!

09:40.872 --> 09:43.240
I'm blind!

09:45.276 --> 09:48.678
No, no!
Not like this!

09:48.679 --> 09:50.614
I don't think
we're seeing eye to eye

09:50.615 --> 09:52.682
about the likelihood
of that happening.

09:53.684 --> 09:55.019
Hey, it's my dad.

09:55.020 --> 09:57.388
My dad's calling me.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.723
Hey, do you know where...?
Ted got his boots?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.458
Yeah. They're fabulous.
I totally want a pair.

10:01.459 --> 10:04.228
Okay, Dad, I will. Thanks.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.431
Guys, Dad says this hurricane is
a bigger deal than you thought.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.500
I'm taking charge.
We are getting out of here.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.536
Okay, what is with
everybody's parents calling

10:12.537 --> 10:14.038
to check up on them?

10:14.039 --> 10:16.173
It's just a little rain.

10:16.174 --> 10:17.741
Lawn-mowing weather.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.876
Bocce weather.

10:19.877 --> 10:21.211
Wow. You're really bummed

10:21.212 --> 10:22.646
that your dad's
not worried about you.

10:22.647 --> 10:23.813
What?!

10:23.814 --> 10:26.783
Eh... What would my
dad be worried about?

10:26.784 --> 10:29.853
That I'm not wearing
enough sunblock?

10:29.854 --> 10:32.122
House-painting weather.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.391
Ted, you're back.

10:34.392 --> 10:36.160
I've changed my mind.
I'm in. Let's go.

10:36.161 --> 10:37.894
Yeah, I changed my mind, too.
You can't come.

10:37.895 --> 10:39.296
Everybody else,
we're moving out.

10:40.231 --> 10:41.631
That's harsh.

10:41.632 --> 10:43.934
You know what else is harsh?
Ultraviolet light.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.835
I fell asleep in the tanning bed
this week

10:45.836 --> 10:48.072
and I think I got a sunburn
on my cheek.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.507
It's so sensitive.

10:50.508 --> 10:53.177
It's like a big, red bull's-eye.

10:53.178 --> 10:54.478
Ouchie.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.880
Did you take my blush
out of my purse?

10:56.881 --> 10:59.683
So, boogie-boarding.

10:59.684 --> 11:01.151
Boogie-boarding.

11:01.152 --> 11:02.586
Oh, come on, Ted,

11:02.587 --> 11:03.920
you can't just leave him here.

11:03.921 --> 11:05.189
Uh, yeah, I can.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.391
You called me a giant
whining bummer.

11:07.392 --> 11:08.858
You're not allowed in my car.

11:08.859 --> 11:11.462
You don't get to find out
if the geisha finds love.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.696
This is about principle.

11:16.033 --> 11:17.568
Hey, Ted.
I'm ready to go.

11:17.569 --> 11:19.503
And you must be "Principle."

11:19.504 --> 11:22.339
Ah, on a separate note,
guys, this is Maya.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.873
I just met her out in the hall.

11:23.874 --> 11:25.175
We have a lot in common,

11:25.176 --> 11:26.910
such as our mutual love
of country music,

11:26.911 --> 11:28.579
NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy.
Just go with it.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.347
She needed a ride
out of the city,

11:30.348 --> 11:32.416
and we have an extra seat
in the car, so...

11:32.417 --> 11:33.817
Okay, let's hit it!

11:33.818 --> 11:35.185
Wow.

11:35.186 --> 11:36.753
It's come to this.

11:36.754 --> 11:38.222
You could help a friend,

11:38.223 --> 11:40.190
but instead, you're choosing
the hot girl in

11:40.191 --> 11:41.492
the tight tank top.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.495
Your training is complete!

11:44.496 --> 11:46.730
I'm so proud of this kid!

11:46.731 --> 11:49.266
But seriously,
the storm's coming in,

11:49.267 --> 11:50.734
so dump the hoochie
and wheels up.

11:50.735 --> 11:52.236
You promised me a seat.

11:52.237 --> 11:53.237
Oh, for God's sake.

11:53.238 --> 11:54.804
You two both go.
I'll stay here.

11:54.805 --> 11:56.473
What? Lily, no!
Shotgun!

11:56.474 --> 11:58.908
You're staying. Then
Lily can come! Wha...?

11:58.909 --> 12:00.611
No, no, no, I'll stay here.
Why?

12:00.612 --> 12:03.614
I just want
some time away from you!

12:04.749 --> 12:07.083
What?

12:07.084 --> 12:09.253
Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you,

12:09.254 --> 12:12.556
but I haven't had a second alone
in weeks!

12:12.557 --> 12:14.224
It's summer vacation!

12:14.225 --> 12:16.760
All I want to do is
sit in the bathtub

12:16.761 --> 12:18.995
and read a book, but now...

12:18.996 --> 12:22.199
Baby, I forgot to bring a book.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.069
Do you mind reading
yours out loud?

12:26.070 --> 12:28.572
Hey, it's been no picnic
for me either.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.073
You don't even do the voices.

12:32.443 --> 12:34.378
Blocked number.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.179
Hello?

12:35.180 --> 12:38.515
RJ? It's your father.

12:38.516 --> 12:40.917
Daddy?

12:40.918 --> 12:42.986
I love you.

12:42.987 --> 12:44.521
It means so much
that you called.

12:44.522 --> 12:47.691
Ha! I knew that you
wanted him to call. Busted!

12:49.160 --> 12:50.494
That was you?

12:50.495 --> 12:52.095
I really think
you should slap him.

12:52.096 --> 12:53.096
You should slap him!

12:53.097 --> 12:53.797
Slap him.
Slap him.

12:53.798 --> 12:55.765
Two cheeks, no waiting.

12:55.766 --> 12:58.635
Good, 'cause I really
think I'm gonna slap him!

12:58.636 --> 12:59.469
So, boog -boarding?

12:59.470 --> 13:00.204
Boogie-boarding.

13:00.205 --> 13:01.638
Come on, Ted.

13:01.639 --> 13:03.807
You're gonna give some
random floozy a ride,

13:03.808 --> 13:04.974
but not take Barney?

13:04.975 --> 13:06.510
Floozy?!

13:06.511 --> 13:07.844
If she's going, I'm not going!

13:07.845 --> 13:09.279
Lily, you're staying.
Let's go.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.681
If Lily's staying,
then I'm staying!

13:10.682 --> 13:12.048
Then I'm going.
Then I'm going.

13:12.049 --> 13:14.184
You can't go, Marshall,
'cause I'm going.

13:14.185 --> 13:16.520
If Barney's going, I'm
not going! Then I can go.

13:16.521 --> 13:17.854
Then I'm staying.
Then I'm staying.

13:17.855 --> 13:18.855
Then I'm going.

13:18.856 --> 13:19.956
Then I'm not going.

13:19.957 --> 13:22.192
Okay, you know what?
I'm going.

13:22.193 --> 13:24.228
This storm's been on Doppler
radar for a week.

13:24.229 --> 13:26.129
I'm the only one
who prepared for it.

13:26.130 --> 13:28.265
And you all made fun of me.
So guess what?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.267
This Boy Scout
is taking a hike. Good-bye!

13:33.037 --> 13:36.406
Maya, real quick, did you think
there was anything here, or...

13:36.407 --> 13:37.407
Oh, I have a boyfriend.

13:37.408 --> 13:38.542
Good-bye!

13:38.543 --> 13:41.378
Um, Ted...?

13:41.379 --> 13:43.813
The time for evacuation is over.

13:43.814 --> 13:46.049
Everyone should now go inside
and be prepared

13:46.050 --> 13:49.253
to stay inside until weather
conditions improve,

13:49.254 --> 13:52.856
which won't likely be
until Sunday afternoon.

13:52.857 --> 13:55.259
We're stuck here?

13:55.260 --> 13:57.193
Okay, let's not panic.

14:00.765 --> 14:04.301
You know what?
Let's panic.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.364
Hey, if we don't make it
through the night,

14:14.765 --> 14:17.759
I want you guys to know,
and I really mean this...

14:18.570 --> 14:22.005
I wish I had branched out
and made more friends in my 20s.

14:22.006 --> 14:24.245
Well,

14:24.468 --> 14:27.163
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

14:27.468 --> 14:30.881
By myself, I guess.

14:30.882 --> 14:33.117
Watch out for bears.

14:36.654 --> 14:41.325
Since this might be the end,
I gotta confess something.

14:41.326 --> 14:42.326
Can I?

14:42.327 --> 14:43.894
Might as well.

14:43.895 --> 14:48.332
Barney and I have been doing
the wild thing...

14:48.333 --> 14:50.934
this whole time.

14:50.935 --> 14:53.804
Except a brief period last year
when he was shacking up

14:53.805 --> 14:55.573
with Marshall's mom.

14:55.574 --> 14:59.176
But luckily, three-ways
were on the menu, so...

14:59.177 --> 15:02.113
Marshall, you know she didn't
say any of that, right?

15:02.114 --> 15:05.616
I know, but I just want
to slap him so bad!

15:05.617 --> 15:08.919
But that tie is so stupid!
But the slap would feel so good!

15:08.920 --> 15:10.854
But he hates that tie so much!

15:10.855 --> 15:13.090
Perhaps I can help.

15:13.091 --> 15:16.893
Marshall, ask yourself this
question: why today?

15:19.097 --> 15:21.432
He hasn't said anything about
that tie for weeks,

15:21.433 --> 15:23.033
and yet, suddenly today,

15:23.034 --> 15:24.935
he can't wear it another second?

15:26.037 --> 15:27.704
No, there's a reason.

15:27.705 --> 15:29.373
You've got something coming up.

15:29.374 --> 15:31.475
Something where you're

15:31.476 --> 15:34.845
on display, vulnerable...

15:34.846 --> 15:35.912
exposed.

15:37.782 --> 15:39.183
It's not work-related.

15:39.184 --> 15:41.619
No, this is relationship stuff.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.388
You're trying
to impress someone.

15:44.389 --> 15:45.756
In the lie you told,

15:45.757 --> 15:47.724
you said you were being chased
by two goons.

15:47.725 --> 15:49.092
So it's two people.

15:49.093 --> 15:50.628
A couple, perhaps.

15:52.130 --> 15:55.366
You're meeting
Nora's parents tomorrow!

15:55.367 --> 15:57.834
Wrong!

15:57.835 --> 15:59.936
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong!

15:59.937 --> 16:03.240
It's in two days, and I really
want them to like me!

16:03.241 --> 16:05.176
Oh-ho!
Therapisted!

16:05.177 --> 16:06.810
Shrinked? Shrunk?

16:06.811 --> 16:08.011
We'll figure it out.

16:08.012 --> 16:09.680
So, boogie-boarding.

16:09.681 --> 16:10.981
Boogie-boarding.

16:10.982 --> 16:14.818
Hey, Lily, can I talk
to you for just a second?

16:15.953 --> 16:17.454
Come here.

16:17.455 --> 16:20.791
Marshall, if I'm in here to
brush your teeth, I swear to...

16:22.093 --> 16:24.495
I'm sorry
that I've been so needy lately.

16:24.496 --> 16:26.730
I know that you need
some time alone.

16:26.731 --> 16:29.600
So... I'll be in
the other room.

16:30.768 --> 16:32.703
You're not going anywhere.

16:34.239 --> 16:37.208
Mmm...
Hey...

16:39.511 --> 16:41.412
And the funny thing is,

16:41.413 --> 16:44.481
after that night,
we'll never be alone again.

16:44.482 --> 16:46.617
You made that in my bathroom?

16:46.618 --> 16:49.019
Whoops.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.822
Wow, a hurricane baby.

16:51.823 --> 16:54.658
Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would
be a sweet name.

16:54.659 --> 16:56.594
It would be a crazy sweet name!

16:56.595 --> 16:58.629
Thanks, Ted.

16:58.630 --> 17:01.532
Anyway, the next day,
after the danger had passed...

17:01.533 --> 17:03.900
It's closed.

17:03.901 --> 17:04.901
Now what?

17:04.902 --> 17:07.904
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

17:07.905 --> 17:09.906
Hey!

17:09.906 --> 17:12.409
Nice!

17:12.410 --> 17:13.676
To surviving the hurricane.

17:13.678 --> 17:14.678
Yay!

17:14.679 --> 17:17.714
I love you guys.
Love you.

17:17.715 --> 17:20.451
<i>I did finally make it up here
to the house later that week</i>

17:20.452 --> 17:22.586
<i>only to find that
a falling oak tree had</i>

17:22.587 --> 17:24.154
<i>landed in the living room.</i>

17:24.155 --> 17:27.089
<i>If we'd been here, it would
have crushed us like bugs.</i>

17:27.090 --> 17:29.426
<i>You see, kids, there's no way
of knowing for sure</i>

17:29.427 --> 17:30.927
<i>where the safest place is...</i>

17:30.928 --> 17:34.431
<i>so the best you can hope for is
to have some good company.</i>

17:34.432 --> 17:36.767
Guys, how far do you think I can
boogie-board on this thing?

17:36.768 --> 17:38.201
So far!

17:38.202 --> 17:41.171
Marshall, your insurance doesn't
kick in till tomorrow.

17:41.172 --> 17:43.407
Yeah, well, you know what?

17:43.408 --> 17:44.975
Life kicks in right now.

17:49.314 --> 17:51.915
? ?

17:54.786 --> 17:56.353
Don't worry, he wasn't hurt...

17:56.354 --> 17:58.155
<i>the first time.
I have splints!</i>

17:58.156 --> 18:00.491
<i>The second time he went through
the front window of Maclaren's.</i>

18:00.492 --> 18:02.793
Hence the
"No Boogie-boarding" sign.

18:02.794 --> 18:04.928
All right, guys, I gotta go.

18:04.929 --> 18:07.665
Barney, good luck
with Nora's parents.

18:07.666 --> 18:08.666
Bye.
Bye.

18:08.667 --> 18:09.667
See you later.

18:09.668 --> 18:11.635
All right. See you.
See ya.

18:12.870 --> 18:13.970
Hey, Barney?

18:13.971 --> 18:14.871
Hmm?

18:14.872 --> 18:16.907
Listen, um, we made a baby

18:16.908 --> 18:18.509
in your bathroom.

18:18.510 --> 18:20.010
So we owe you one.

18:21.245 --> 18:23.246
So we say...

18:23.247 --> 18:25.382
you can take off the ducky tie.

18:27.452 --> 18:29.787
For three slaps.

18:29.788 --> 18:31.655
Three slaps?

18:31.656 --> 18:34.491
And to be clear,
this would add three slaps

18:34.492 --> 18:38.161
to Marshall's existing one,
giving him four slaps in total.

18:38.162 --> 18:38.995
Deal.

18:41.966 --> 18:43.266
I'm free!

18:43.267 --> 18:47.170
God, this feels so good!

18:47.171 --> 18:49.873
This was a mistake!

18:49.874 --> 18:51.241
I wanna put the tie back on!

18:51.242 --> 18:52.476
I wanna put the tie back on!

18:52.477 --> 18:54.044
Why do I have to be
Barney right now?

18:56.280 --> 18:57.715
Three slaps remaining!

18:57.716 --> 19:00.016
Three slaps. Wow,
I like the sound of that.

19:00.017 --> 19:01.819
I think I'll save
those bad boys,

19:01.820 --> 19:03.286
you know, for a rainy day.

19:03.287 --> 19:04.888
Okay.
The worst is over.

19:06.891 --> 19:07.991
Ah!

19:07.992 --> 19:10.527
Two slaps remaining!

19:12.163 --> 19:13.397
It's all right.

19:13.398 --> 19:15.332
Hey, it's all done...

19:15.333 --> 19:16.633
for now.

19:16.634 --> 19:18.435
I think I need to go home

19:18.436 --> 19:20.637
and reevaluate how
I make life decisions.

19:20.638 --> 19:22.939
Come on. I have
to go back to work.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.008
Let's split a cab. Okay. Yeah.

19:30.548 --> 19:35.819
Did you ever tell those guys
about that other thing

19:35.820 --> 19:37.220
that almost happened?

19:37.221 --> 19:41.191
That other thing?

19:41.192 --> 19:42.926
Oh, that. No. Did you?

19:42.927 --> 19:44.194
No.

19:45.430 --> 19:47.330
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that phone call.

19:47.331 --> 19:48.399
Oh, it's fine.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.834
No, it is so not fine.
I was a jerk.

19:50.835 --> 19:52.836
And if you don't mind my
saying, your dad is

19:52.837 --> 19:55.873
a complete idiot
for not calling.

19:55.874 --> 19:58.542
He should never let a day go by
without calling you

19:58.543 --> 20:02.613
because when I let a day go by
without talking to you...

20:02.614 --> 20:08.419
Um, that day's just no good.

20:13.024 --> 20:15.125
Um, sorry.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.427
Um...

20:17.462 --> 20:19.129
It's my dad.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.263
Wait, show me your hands.

20:20.264 --> 20:21.298
My hands.

20:21.299 --> 20:24.200
Hey, Dad!

20:24.201 --> 20:26.937
That's what I've been saying!

20:26.938 --> 20:28.806
Golf weather!

20:28.807 --> 20:30.507
Can you believe we almost...?

20:30.508 --> 20:32.075
I know.

20:32.076 --> 20:33.143
Good thing we didn't.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.245
Yeah. I mean, not
long after that

20:35.246 --> 20:36.613
you got together with Nora.

20:36.614 --> 20:37.781
And you met Kevin.

20:37.782 --> 20:38.882
Yeah.
Disaster averted.

20:38.883 --> 20:40.183
Exactly.

20:40.184 --> 20:42.252
It would've ruined everything
if we'd been all...

20:42.253 --> 20:43.226
ah-la-la-la...

20:43.346 --> 20:45.355
I know, right?
So dumb...

20:45.356 --> 20:47.816
La-la-la-la-la-la...
