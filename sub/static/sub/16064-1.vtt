WEBVTT

03:27.749 --> 03:30.957
Go in a little deeper.
It's gotta snap easy.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.293
We don't want anybody
getting killed out there.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.635
Whoo! Little John!

03:41.763 --> 03:44.049
This is beautiful! Did you see that?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.839
It looks a little heavy, Morgan.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.012
It'll knock you on your ass, sir knight!

03:48.186 --> 03:51.770
That's just what I'm afraid of, a hit in
the head with that thing. Let me see it.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.514
It doesn't have as much force
as a Lance tip head on.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.480
A Lance tip will snap your neck for you.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.069
That's for swinging side-arm.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.961
I don't know, little John.
It's not like a ball and chain.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.881
The chain absorbs most of the impact.
This damn thing's solid.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.881
So, what the hell?
Kay's got that long-handled battle-axe.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.010
Yeah, but the head's made out of
rubber. This thing's got its own inertia.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.680
Did you see that?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.228
Just cos your armour'll
take a bazooka shell.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.942
Don't forget some of us
are wearing tinfoil.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.608
That's your problem.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.857
My problem is to knock you
out of that saddle,

04:44.993 --> 04:46.403
and this baby is sure gonna help.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.681
We don't need to make it
any rougher than it already is.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.868
All right, we won't use it today.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.207
We'll try it out first, ok?

04:54.336 --> 04:56.418
Unless you'd like to use it.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.037
- Ah, no thanks.
- I'm not afraid of it.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.468
I'll still blow you away.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.085
- Has anyone seen Billy yet?
- Not since he rode out with lin.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.634
Geez, how can we tourney
without our king to lead us?

05:07.766 --> 05:09.222
There may not be a tourney.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.842
- Alan, we got trouble with the law.
- Aw, Christ.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.538
- Did he say where he was heading?
- Somewhere down by the river.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.364
Aah! Oh!

05:23.490 --> 05:26.232
Lester, I think maybe
we should go get a seat, ok?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.970
Oh, Helen, shut up
and give me another beer.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.827
- Daddy.
- Another 75 cents.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.288
- Huh?
- Another 75 cents.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.204
No, no, sweetheart, I paid you for two.
That's my second ear of corn.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.953
No, no, no, sweetheart, you dropped
your second ear of corn.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.173
That's your third ear of corn.
Another 75 cents, please.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.239
Julie,
you're shaking up the beers!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.504
Daddy, you're a slob!

05:48.640 --> 05:50.301
A fat

05:50.433 --> 05:53.175
slob jerk!

05:53.311 --> 05:56.929
And, mother, you're a wimp!

05:57.065 --> 06:02.651
Do you hear that, Helen? That's your
daughter calling me a fat slob jerk!

06:02.779 --> 06:05.316
Bingo.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.241
Hey, Morgan le fay.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.660
- You look beautiful again today.
- Mm-hm.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.954
- Come here. Come here.
- Stop it. Stop.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.703
Hey, you better watch out.
I'm fixing your bikes, you know.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.276
- You're fixing my bikes, you know?
- Mm-hm.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.460
I'll fix your bike, you know.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.507
- Look, don't put that grease on me.
- Uh-huh.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.627
No, whoa, whoa! Stop.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.754
We got trouble with the law.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.598
- What?
- Go find Merlin.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.729
Oh! Oh, you jerk!

06:47.866 --> 06:52.109
Oh. Oh, my god. Oh, god.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.237
- It's all right. I'll be all right.
- Are you hurt? God, I'm so sorry.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.238
I can't believe it. Ow! Damn!

06:57.375 --> 06:59.366
- Aah!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

06:59.502 --> 07:02.289
- No, no, no, I'm hurt enough already.
- Oh, gee, I didn't see you.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.941
I was walking down this way
and before I knew it

07:03.965 --> 07:05.080
right, right, right.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.423
Here.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.545
No problem.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.720
No broken bones.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.311
Anyway, it's what I do.
Fall off bikes is what I do.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.352
- You'll see. You gonna be here later?
- I don't know.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.067
Oh, well.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.482
Er... it gets kinda rough out there
sometimes, huh?

07:31.618 --> 07:34.735
- I mean, does it get bloody?
- Nah, sometimes a little.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.659
It's never too bad
when it's just a show, though.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.534
- You ever ride a bike?
- Uh-uh.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.912
Well, listen, I gotta go for a little ride.
You wanna come?

07:45.924 --> 07:48.336
Come on. Come on.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.182
- Ok, now just hang on to me.
- Oh!

08:02.691 --> 08:04.251
Like I said,
I'm gonna have to shut you down.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.561
Now just wait a minute.
We have a permit.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.607
Come on, tuck.
Where the hell's the permit?

08:11.533 --> 08:14.445
I didn't sign this.
You, er... sign this, Jess?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.660
Never seen it before.
Guess the sheriff must have signed it.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.075
I don't see how we can
let this go on, Jess.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.915
No, er... medical facilities. No doctor.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.705
- He's a doctor.
- He's a what?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.400
And he's got enough equipment and
supplies to handle an emergency.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.962
- You're a doctor? Medical doctor?
- That's right.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.958
- Licensed to practise?
- In good standing.

08:33.096 --> 08:37.009
No malpractice.
Clean record. No problems.

08:38.226 --> 08:42.139
Look, so he didn't sign the permit.
The sheriff did.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.979
So let's go find the sheriff!

08:45.108 --> 08:47.815
It's got nothing to do with who
signed the permit and who didn't.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.870
Where the hell have you been?
We have trouble with the police.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.455
Who's she?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.542
- Who are you?
- Julie Dean!

09:13.678 --> 09:17.466
- What?
- My name's Julie!

09:17.599 --> 09:19.385
Her name's Julie!

09:57.180 --> 09:58.670
What's the problem, magician?

09:58.807 --> 10:02.891
It's, um... same old thing, you know?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.055
We properly got
a permit to use the field,

10:05.188 --> 10:06.916
and it was signed
by the sheriff of Bakersfield.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.900
The deputy doesn't want
to know about the sheriff.

10:08.942 --> 10:13.732
He wants his own little pay cheque or
he says he'll shut down the tournament.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.149
- Tuck, what's the gate today?
- We're not paying.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.989
Aw, come on, Billy.
What do you think you're gonna do?

10:19.119 --> 10:22.657
I'm gonna say no, that's all. We're not
paying. It's wrong to pay this guy off.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.997
- Come on.
- It's wrong, Morgan!

10:29.712 --> 10:33.079
We don't need any hassles. We're
talking about serious hassles here.

10:33.216 --> 10:37.459
I don't think this guy's gonna do
anything. He's not gonna shut us down.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.428
He's not gonna do shit.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.390
Come on. Come on,
let's start the games.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.345
'And he walked him!

11:01.369 --> 11:04.611
'And that should be all
for Johnson here in the eighth.'

11:16.467 --> 11:18.173
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

11:18.386 --> 11:20.968
Welcome to the games
of the court of sir William the king.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.256
When t h white wrote down

11:24.392 --> 11:27.304
the magical tale of Arthur
and the round table,

11:27.437 --> 11:30.224
he called it "the once and future king".

11:30.356 --> 11:33.598
Once honour and nobility reigned.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.977
In the future, may they also reign.

11:47.290 --> 11:51.078
In those magical days,
when honour was the true thing,

11:51.211 --> 11:55.921
a good knight's hardened steel
was a symbol of that honour.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.712
You know, I don't have the balls
to wear anything like that.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.961
Don't I wish! Give me a beer.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.214
In times of peace,
the knights would ride tournaments,

12:06.351 --> 12:10.811
to keep their skills sharp and to
practise the chivalries of battle.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.476
Don't touch, Jim. Those things
can bite your fingers off.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.523
And now the king of our little
Camelot, the noble sire William

12:18.655 --> 12:20.111
and his lovely lady linet.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.152
- What's the new toy?
- That's the mace I made for Morgan.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.615
It's got a solid hit?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.110
Yeah, it's made
out of metal, not rubber.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.114
- Alan thinks it's too heavy.
- Let me see it.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.458
Well, I never did know
a king who was on time, did you?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.545
I didn't think we should use it
until we tried it out first.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.001
Trumpets.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.262
Just do it.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.390
If Morgan needs a hand weapon,
tell him it's ok to use the mace.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.982
Ah, come on, bill, you...

12:58.278 --> 13:02.897
My lords and ladies, the ever punctual
sir William the king.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.651
Long live king William!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.256
Hey, what's up? Is something wrong?

13:30.393 --> 13:33.180
Oh, it's... it's nothing.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.190
And now the noble knights
of our kingdom!

14:16.314 --> 14:21.274
What you will see, ladies and gents,
is absolutely real.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.688
It's like drawing lots. You never know
who you're gonna ride against.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.111
Now, any foul play
will be ruled on by the king,

14:29.243 --> 14:31.734
the ultimate referee,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.511
and the king himself
may ride in the game,

14:33.581 --> 14:34.941
should he feel an opponent worthy.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.136
Far out!

14:58.272 --> 15:01.810
That was sir pellinore
besting sir ban of Boston.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.683
And a well-placed blow it was.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.187
- Your life is in my hands, sucker.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.323
Hey, Joe!

15:08.449 --> 15:11.657
The winners fight each other
until there's a champion.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.026
- Did you see that shot?
- Yeah, it's all right, brother.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.288
They're like acrobats, that's all.
They're like the wrestlers on TV.

15:17.417 --> 15:22.252
They got these blood bags in their
mouths, you know what I mean?

15:22.380 --> 15:23.836
On!

15:25.758 --> 15:28.875
Ewing! You don't have a chance!

15:29.011 --> 15:31.218
It's ewain.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.075
Keep your eye on me today.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.075
Sir ewing beats sir bleoboris.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.831
All right!

16:08.009 --> 16:11.422
Sir marhalt
defeated by sir rocky!

16:11.554 --> 16:14.296
Better luck next time, sir marhalt.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.091
Far out!

16:24.442 --> 16:29.937
Next to ride against sir Kay,
Morgan, the infamous black knight.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.464
Yeah!

16:52.929 --> 16:56.968
In cases like this, the king,
sir William, can judge a Victor

16:57.099 --> 16:59.340
or call for another pass.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.757
Now in the case of another pass,

17:00.853 --> 17:05.061
the knights may not use their lances
but must turn to hand weapons.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.810
Neither man was the clear Victor.
Fight again, sir knights.

17:09.945 --> 17:14.609
Morgan had the advantage so sir Kay
will choose. Mounted or hacks, sir Kay?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.529
Hacks.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.351
No, no, the mace. The mace.

17:51.946 --> 17:52.946
What?

17:53.072 --> 17:57.111
Billy says you can use it, if you want it.
It's up to you.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.279
Yeah?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.871
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.430
Ok.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.485
In the side hacks,
the knights don't use the rail.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.481
They ride in the open field
and they can pass at each other

18:37.617 --> 18:40.905
for as long as it takes
for one to eliminate the other

18:41.037 --> 18:43.244
or until one concedes.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.341
God, they're really revved up.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.723
Come on, Kay!

20:01.242 --> 20:04.075
Billy, you're not gonna do this.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.910
Maybe Morgan will lose.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.588
Yahoo!

20:19.468 --> 20:23.256
Billy, your shoulder.
You're still not right from the last one.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.193
Er... the king, ladies and gentlemen.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.403
The king will ride against
sir Morgan, the black knight.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.413
All right, sir knight. Here.

20:59.550 --> 21:03.088
The king can elect to face
any knight he deems worthy

21:03.220 --> 21:06.178
or any knight who offends his honour.

21:06.307 --> 21:10.892
Sir Morgan being a worthy knight,
let's assume the former in this case.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.430
What is it?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.677
If the king goes down,
we have to be ready for rescue.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.725
Why?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.746
We have to get to Morgan
before he can make the king yield.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.011
If Billy surrenders, he loses the crown.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.513
I et's move it out!

23:27.323 --> 23:29.860
The king is rescued!

23:29.992 --> 23:32.324
The king is rescued!

23:35.789 --> 23:39.247
My god. Get a stretcher!
Get a... get a stretcher!

23:39.376 --> 23:40.991
Punch, whiteface, somebody!

23:54.350 --> 23:57.137
Use the power of his swing!

24:01.899 --> 24:04.140
- Watch out!
- Watch it, watch it, watch it!

24:04.276 --> 24:05.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.434
Use his power!

24:09.698 --> 24:12.906
- Come on! Yeah!
- Hit it, Alan!

24:22.378 --> 24:25.666
Oh, wow! Ooh! Far out!

24:31.845 --> 24:33.551
You all right? Let me see.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.967
- I'm all right.
- You're all right.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.307
- You almost made it, didn't you?
- Yeah.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.641
Basics, morg.

24:39.770 --> 24:43.262
You forgot your basics.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.184
No, I didn't.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.608
- Wow, this is a hell of a show!
- Come on.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.573
It's a fake. It's all a fake.
They try to make it look tough.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.284
They try to make it look dangerous.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.621
All right, who proved what out there?

25:18.726 --> 25:21.388
Morgan proved he could kick my ass.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.394
Steady.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.485
- What's the story, Merlin?
- Could be worse. Could be better.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.980
His helmet and his chest plate
just scissored him.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.951
- Took a big bite. Missed the artery.
- It's nobody's fault, man.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.321
- You know what you're doing?
- Hey!

25:42.458 --> 25:46.076
Why don't you all get out of here?
I'm gonna stitch him up.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.372
Ok, let's go. Let's get out of here.

25:52.801 --> 25:57.386
We're all in this
because of the lifestyle.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.130
And we got our own place,
and you did that. You set that up.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.134
And you know what it's about.

26:03.270 --> 26:07.354
And what it's about is having
things we can count on.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.849
And one of the things
we count on, man, is you!

26:11.111 --> 26:13.193
Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going, kid?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.779
I'd like to get Billy Davis's autograph.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.446
Well, the king is a little busy right now.
You want to try again later?

26:19.578 --> 26:22.160
Now, you've been messing up lately,

26:22.289 --> 26:24.746
but you keep putting it on the rest of us,

26:24.875 --> 26:26.866
and this whole thing's gonna blow up,

26:27.002 --> 26:29.539
and nobody needs that kind of shit, man.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.957
That's why we're here.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.762
What's his problem, lin?

26:47.898 --> 26:51.231
Wow! You were fantastic!
Fabulous! I just couldn't believe it.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.567
- Come on, we gotta finish the show.
- Isn't he great?

26:53.695 --> 26:56.027
God. Wait till I tell
my girlfriends about this.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.956
Ok, look, everybody get out of here.
We got a show to finish. Let's go.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.163
Even the best suffer defeat.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.576
Rocky is down,

27:07.709 --> 27:12.203
leaving sir Hector of ewick
to compete with the championship

27:12.339 --> 27:16.002
with sir ewain
against sir bors and sir Alan.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.133
Is she ok?

27:22.891 --> 27:26.224
Sir Hector of ewick
competing in game one.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.435
Are you all right?

27:28.564 --> 27:31.931
- Where is she?
- Rocky!

27:32.067 --> 27:35.525
Basics. You forgot your basics.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.986
You'd better disappear quick, killer,
or I'm gonna get that mace

27:41.118 --> 27:44.702
and do something very very bad
to your basics.

27:44.830 --> 27:48.573
- Ooh.
- Ha-ha.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.791
- Oh.
- Sounds like fun.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.922
Had another dream.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.170
That right?

28:03.307 --> 28:05.969
Black bird again.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.841
Same black bird.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.432
The way you get knocked around,

28:10.564 --> 28:13.431
you're bound to have
some weird dreams, Billy.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.254
Come on, man. Look, man, you're
supposed to believe in stuff like this.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.714
Say, man, if I didn't believe in magic,

28:17.738 --> 28:23.324
I'd still be treating gall bladders,
prostates and stuff like that.

28:23.452 --> 28:28.742
See, magic ain't got nothing to do with
organs and glands and busted necks.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.492
Magic got to do with the soul, man.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.414
Only the soul's got destiny.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.628
It got wings, it's can fly.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.624
That's magic. The body...

28:39.760 --> 28:43.344
The body's just got a few minutes down
here in the dirt with the rest of us.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.884
- You see things before they happen.
- Mm.

28:46.016 --> 28:50.134
That's probability.
Some things is just sure to happen.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.477
Seeing 'em coming
ain't nothing to get excited about.

28:52.606 --> 28:58.021
No, you taught me too good,
magician. You taught me to believe.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.269
That black bird's gonna get me.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.192
Yeah, maybe
you'll make it happen yourself.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.361
Probability, man.

29:05.494 --> 29:09.658
Some day, some cat comes along
with a black bird painted on his shield.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.327
You freak out, drop your guard,

29:12.459 --> 29:15.917
and, ca-po-ze, ca-poza,
ba-uu-wa, he gets you.

29:17.339 --> 29:22.083
- Maybe that's my destiny.
- Big d. Ah, destiny'll mess with you.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.505
Like the real king Arthur.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.720
You know how the story go.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.760
Let's get it once more, huh?

29:29.893 --> 29:32.350
Command performance for the king.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.891
A-o00h.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.360
Once upon a time ago, ba-Bo-zee,

29:42.489 --> 29:46.357
in days of old, when knights were bold,
there was king Arthur.

29:46.493 --> 29:49.656
Oh, Merlin told him
that his own kid would kill him,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.700
so Arthur sends all the babies
in the land away on a boat,

29:52.833 --> 29:55.666
not knowing which of the many women
he was always messing with

29:55.794 --> 29:56.829
might have had his kid.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.873
Boat wrecks in a storm.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.549
Destiny, big d, you see.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.418
Ah.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.422
One baby lives, Arthur's baby.

30:09.558 --> 30:14.222
Nobleman finds it along the shore,
raises it to be a fighting knight.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.970
Knight comes by one day and... whew!

30:17.107 --> 30:20.599
Wastes the king, blows him away.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.987
If Arthur hadn't have tried to stop it,
it might never have happened.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.607
Course, he only got the king's body.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.575
That's it.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.584
And we're coming down to it,
ladies and gentlemen,

30:43.717 --> 30:47.209
the final passes that will decide
the champion for today's games.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.463
Sir Alan will ride
against the noble Hector.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.965
Let me get it hitched.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.889
Alan! Alan, wait!

31:07.324 --> 31:09.690
Er... who gave you that?

31:10.827 --> 31:13.569
- What?
- Some guy, right?

31:13.705 --> 31:16.117
No, my father gave it to me.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.499
If that's a present from another guy,

31:19.628 --> 31:23.337
it's bad luck for you to give it
to me as your champion.

31:23.465 --> 31:26.423
So, if I lose, it's on you.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.529
Whoo! All right!

31:58.208 --> 32:00.665
And so, my lords and ladies,

32:00.794 --> 32:03.706
the championship of the day
will be decided in the final tilt

32:03.839 --> 32:08.424
between the gallant sir ewain
and the noble sir Alan.

32:08.552 --> 32:11.510
All right! All right!

32:21.523 --> 32:23.605
My hero!

32:26.778 --> 32:28.643
See? Good luck, huh?

32:28.780 --> 32:32.614
The king. My lords and
ladies, the king is restored to us.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.108
Long live the king!

32:37.581 --> 32:42.450
The king is on his throne and in good
time to honour the champion of the day.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.292
And to us, my lords and ladies,

32:44.421 --> 32:49.916
the champion of the day is truly
a champion, honoured and rewarded.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.087
There is a purse
for the champion, of course,

32:52.220 --> 32:55.132
but, more importantly,
until the next games,

32:55.265 --> 32:59.008
he will sit in an honoured place
in the king's favour.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.556
He will be absolved from certain duties

33:01.688 --> 33:04.225
and be granted privileges
within our society.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.645
So, being champion of the games
is no small thing to a knight.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.358
Make it three and I'll buy you a beer.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.524
- And the brave sir ewing...
- Yeah? You're on.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.693
The Valiant sir Alan,
they both deserve the honour well.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.909
May the better man win!

33:19.915 --> 33:22.156
Good night, sweet prince.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.795
Sir ewing, my lords and ladies!

33:36.932 --> 33:39.298
- The champion of the day!
- Ewain, ewain!

33:39.434 --> 33:42.050
Hey, pip! It's ewain the invincible!

33:42.187 --> 33:46.055
Nah, I'm all right. Get the bike.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.601
It's ok. Go ahead.

34:16.972 --> 34:21.090
Hi. I could sure use one
of those rubdowns tonight.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.329
What's the matter?
Alan get all the townie action, huh?

34:23.353 --> 34:24.559
Oh, geez.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.181
Where's Julie?
Has she come back yet?

34:30.318 --> 34:32.603
I don't know.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.674
So, how in the
hell are we gonna find her?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.418
She's probably gone home.
Come on, let's go.

34:36.449 --> 34:41.784
I'll kick that kid's face,
calling me a fat slob jerk!

34:41.913 --> 34:45.280
And now the part I know
some of you have been waiting for.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.204
This is a traditional part
of our tournament.

34:48.335 --> 34:51.418
So, those of you with your own bikes...

34:51.547 --> 34:54.380
Just what the hell
am I signing away here, man?

34:54.509 --> 34:57.467
Well, your... your intelligence,
your good looks,

34:57.596 --> 34:59.632
and your social standing,
nothing really.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.597
Here, put this on and keep it on.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.342
And if nobody's
up for a direct challenge...

35:05.478 --> 35:07.238
If you don't know
how to write your own name,

35:07.314 --> 35:08.804
why don't you just make an x?

35:11.192 --> 35:12.898
Don't forget to pick up the helmet.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.111
It's the thing that looks like your head,
only it's got a chin strap.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.774
Billy, I...

35:22.078 --> 35:24.740
Aw, man.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.626
You all right? Yeah?

35:33.548 --> 35:36.290
I guess little John's mace is too heavy.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.260
This is...

35:45.602 --> 35:47.718
Yeah. Ok.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.978
Look, what did you do out there, man?

35:51.107 --> 35:54.520
You went under me like you wanted me
to smash you or something.

35:54.653 --> 35:58.896
I mean, you wanna prove the mace is
too heavy, you don't have to die to do it.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.614
Oh, sir William? Could you sign
your name on your picture?

36:01.743 --> 36:04.735
Could you make it to Billy?
Billy's my name, too.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.203
- Look at that spread.
- What is this?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.243
It's a magazine called "cycle riders".

36:10.543 --> 36:13.501
Now, see, l... I didn't know about this.
Merl, I didn't know about this.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.838
Must be the piece they did in johnstown.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.736
I mean, obviously that is you.
I mean, you were there.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.093
Yeah, I was there.
Yeah, right, that's me.

36:25.100 --> 36:30.470
I'm sorry, but I don't like
this kind of stuff.

36:30.605 --> 36:34.143
All I want you to do is just,
you know, sign your name.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.601
I can't.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.819
See, I...

36:42.701 --> 36:46.819
This is like evil knievel
or somebody like that.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.664
It's got nothing to do
with what we're doing.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.283
Do you understand me?
I can't. I'm sorry.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.337
I'm really sorry.

37:00.719 --> 37:05.383
Come here, my man. How about
the autograph of the next king?

37:05.515 --> 37:07.722
You can be the first.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.143
Oh, wow!

37:14.190 --> 37:16.021
Oh, wow!

37:20.488 --> 37:22.341
There, now you have something
to hang on my Lance.

37:22.365 --> 37:25.323
She's got plenty
to hang on your Lance.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.741
- I owe you, grundy.
- Hey, retail prices, you know.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.865
Thanks, man.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.486
Very clever, very clever.
But he's a comedian.

38:06.451 --> 38:10.160
- Speaking of clowns...
- Yeah, he's still here.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.404
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.097
- What now?
- Let's go raise some hell!

38:35.230 --> 38:36.595
All right!

39:12.058 --> 39:13.514
Damn, he's good.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.664
Hey! I'm really impressed!

39:38.585 --> 39:41.122
But I wanted the axe back!

39:41.254 --> 39:44.792
- All you had to do was ask.
- Thanks.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.165
- By the way...
- Yeah?

39:47.302 --> 39:49.133
Look out for that barn!

39:49.262 --> 39:50.422
Aah!

40:06.821 --> 40:09.779
Whoa! Whoa! Shit!

40:22.754 --> 40:25.746
That's really not bad.

40:25.882 --> 40:30.672
You looked pretty great there
for a while. But you lost your guts.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.215
You gotta have guts
to do what we do, baby.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.014
That's basic number one.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.358
J said the signifyin' monkey
to the lion one day

40:54.494 --> 40:57.361
j there's a great big elephant
down the way

40:57.497 --> 41:00.955
j going round talking, I am sorry to say

41:01.084 --> 41:04.121
j about your mama
in a scandalous way

41:04.253 --> 41:07.040
j he's talking 'bout your mama
and your grandma too

41:07.173 --> 41:09.710
j he ain't got too much respect for you

41:10.593 --> 41:12.754
j you wanna chat? I sure am glad

41:12.887 --> 41:16.345
j cos what he said about your mama
made me mad

41:16.474 --> 41:19.261
j signifyin' monkey

41:19.394 --> 41:21.385
j sit up in your tree

41:22.063 --> 41:25.305
j you is always lyin' and signifyin'

41:25.441 --> 41:27.807
j but you better not monkey with me

41:27.944 --> 41:31.357
- j say what?
- & signifyin' monkey

41:31.489 --> 41:34.447
- j hoo!
- J stay up in your tree

41:34.575 --> 41:39.365
j you is always lyin' and signifyin'
but you better not monkey with me...

41:39.497 --> 41:41.237
Take it, tuck.

41:47.213 --> 41:51.297
Everybody here made a conscious
adult decision to be here,

41:51.426 --> 41:54.042
to be with you.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.012
When you go crazy, you force them
to rethink that decision.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.972
- You've got to...
- Compromise.

42:00.101 --> 42:03.389
Change doesn't have
to mean compromise.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.603
We're bigger now. Things are different.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.474
Christ, we've got an overhead!

42:12.363 --> 42:15.355
Publicity helps the overhead.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.198
They're bringing in more crowds.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.908
More sucker-headed
American driftwood

42:20.038 --> 42:23.030
that can't tell the difference
between me and Jim Jones

42:23.166 --> 42:26.408
or Charles manson
or the great wallenda.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.082
That kid... that kid thinks
I'm evel knievel!

42:30.214 --> 42:35.425
That kid thinks you're Billy Davis!
Sir William the knight! You're his hero!

42:35.553 --> 42:38.590
I'm not trying to be a hero!

42:38.723 --> 42:40.384
I'm fighting the dragon!

42:40.516 --> 42:42.757
J always lying and signifying

42:42.894 --> 42:46.011
j but you better not monkey with me

42:46.147 --> 42:48.854
j you better not monkey

42:48.983 --> 42:52.066
j you is always lyin' and signifyin'

42:52.195 --> 42:54.937
j but you better not monkey with me j

42:58.826 --> 43:01.909
- all right!
- Nice! Finel

43:02.038 --> 43:03.403
all right!

43:11.089 --> 43:14.707
I was never into
this king Arthur crap anyway.

43:14.842 --> 43:19.757
I was into the bikes, man, the bikes.
That's how I got here.

43:19.889 --> 43:22.221
He just recently found out
Morgan le fay was a woman.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.970
That's all right.
Pip's known all his life he's a woman.

43:29.148 --> 43:31.434
Oh...!

43:38.574 --> 43:40.986
Are you gay, pip?

43:41.119 --> 43:44.987
In the sense of happy,
carefree, light-hearted?

43:45.123 --> 43:47.159
And can we have this discussion later?

43:47.291 --> 43:49.373
Come on, be straight with me.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.313
Come on, Angie. When did you
ever see pip with a woman?

43:51.337 --> 43:53.623
I see him with rocky a lot.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.667
Well, come on,
pip hangs out with me a lot.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.542
Yeah, but everybody knows
you're my main squeeze.

43:58.678 --> 44:01.078
Oh, sure, with you hanging around
with anything that wiggles.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.048
People probably think I'm gay.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.097
Ever since I've been a grease monkey,
they've been thinking that anyway.

44:09.230 --> 44:11.391
Yeah, right.

44:11.524 --> 44:14.516
- Are you gay, pip?
- God.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.188
Great to have you around, Angie.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.153
You really know how to cut through it,
don't you?

44:19.282 --> 44:24.117
Damn it! You take it every day of your
life from people that think you're gay.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.237
Well, I'm one of your best friends
and I don't know. Are you?

44:28.916 --> 44:31.578
I don't know either.

44:31.711 --> 44:34.418
I don't, ok?

44:35.756 --> 44:38.122
Well, maybe that's why
you take so much heat, huh?

44:40.595 --> 44:42.506
I mean, rocky doesn't take any heat.

44:42.638 --> 44:46.347
- Yeah, that's cos rocky kicks ass.
- No, that's not true.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.933
I don't take any heat
because I know who I am,

44:50.062 --> 44:52.724
and very often I do kick ass.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.582
J down a country Lane
I strolled on a door, I chanced to knock

45:20.718 --> 45:24.552
j have you any pots and kettles
with a rusty hole...

45:27.391 --> 45:31.475
- Did you invite company?
- No, just you, I guess.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.096
Oh, man.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.940
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus, it's the swine.

45:38.069 --> 45:41.311
- I smell bacon.
- That's the swine, man.

45:41.447 --> 45:44.189
Oh, whither goest, thou yonder?

45:56.128 --> 45:59.040
Come on.

46:00.716 --> 46:04.004
- Hello!
- Open up!

46:04.136 --> 46:05.592
What's going on?

46:05.721 --> 46:08.963
We got reason to believe there's
a controlled substance in this Van.

46:09.141 --> 46:12.804
- Oh, yeah? You got a warrant?
- Yeah.

46:12.937 --> 46:16.304
- Right here.
- Jesus Christ.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.160
- Hey, tuck!
- Huh?

46:35.293 --> 46:37.750
What the hell's going on, tuck?

46:39.463 --> 46:42.045
What the hell's going on?

46:42.174 --> 46:43.960
It's a raid.

46:44.093 --> 46:46.175
It's the cops from Bakersfield.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.010
But there's nothing to raid, tuck.

46:48.139 --> 46:52.599
They're looking for something.
I snuck out.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.718
I was afraid they'd find my still.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.516
I keep telling you, tuck,
wine's not illegal.

46:57.648 --> 47:02.267
Well, it's more exciting
to think that it is.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.485
Come on, Julie, let's go.

47:04.613 --> 47:07.446
I better not go back there!
They're probably looking for Mel!

47:07.575 --> 47:09.816
All right, you stay here with tuck.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.611
I'll be back.

47:17.543 --> 47:21.252
This is unreal. This is totally unreal.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.629
Hey, didn't you take
some vows or something?

47:28.804 --> 47:34.970
Oh, no. I do believe we've found
a cache of elusive sponduics.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.219
The unholy weed.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.688
- It's a plant, Billy.
- I know it, man.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.982
All right, let's go.

47:50.117 --> 47:53.280
As you may remember from
our, er... earlier conversations,

47:53.412 --> 47:55.698
I am a reasonable man.

47:55.831 --> 47:59.949
I'm sure we can reach a... er, informal
bail arrangement for your boy here.

48:00.086 --> 48:04.671
You again! I told you to pay
this guy off the last time.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.630
Now I bet your price just went up, huh?

48:06.759 --> 48:08.374
And I said we're not paying.

48:08.511 --> 48:13.380
And we're not paying this rat-pile
heap of dog shit a goddamn cent.

48:13.516 --> 48:15.427
You wanna take him in? Take me in, too.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.412
Oh, that's real sweet.
We'll all go together.

48:17.436 --> 48:20.394
Merl, go get Steve.
We ain't paying off on no frame.

48:20.523 --> 48:22.388
Bagman ain't going to no jail alone.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.982
We got a show
to do in three days!

48:25.111 --> 48:28.649
- We do have to get there.
- Maybe we can't make it.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.221
Oh, yeah, sure, sure. We haven't
got enough problems as it is.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.865
I do think you boys ought to reconsider.

48:33.994 --> 48:37.407
Small town jails is,
er... uncomfortable places.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.747
Damn uncomfortable.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.708
All them lead pipes and stuff.

48:42.837 --> 48:45.374
Bagman ain't going to no jail alone.

48:46.507 --> 48:50.341
Anything happens in that jail,
there's gonna be a witness.

48:52.638 --> 48:55.926
The rest of you stay here
until we get out.

49:01.522 --> 49:05.106
Now are you going
to arrest me, fat man,

49:05.234 --> 49:07.771
or do I have to do something
to provoke you?

49:07.903 --> 49:10.315
All right, Jack, you got it.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.410
Aw, Christ.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.754
Let's go.

49:29.884 --> 49:33.297
That man's hurt. Better not be worser
when I see him again.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.044
Neither one of 'em. You hear me?

49:35.181 --> 49:39.015
Oh, that's right, you're a doctor.
Damn lucky thing you're around, doc.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.143
Hit it.

49:40.269 --> 49:42.260
Wait here.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.524
This is crazy!

49:46.650 --> 49:49.210
Let's go after them, pay them,
and then get the hell out of here!

49:49.278 --> 49:51.189
We're not paying!
That's the way Billy wants it!

49:51.322 --> 49:52.437
Billy's insane!

49:52.573 --> 49:54.693
It's done, Morgan!
There's nothing we can do about it.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.193
Oh, that's great.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.444
So, what, we save 500 bucks here and
we lose 2,000 for blowing a show?

49:59.580 --> 50:00.580
That's good.

50:00.706 --> 50:05.291
We're not gonna lose anything.
We're going to Lawrence.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.377
Angie, you go ahead now
with tuck and pip.

50:08.506 --> 50:09.506
When you get to a phone,

50:09.632 --> 50:12.339
try all the motels in Lawrence
and see if you can find Steve.

50:12.468 --> 50:16.006
If you can't raise him by phone, as
soon as you get to town, try to find him.

50:16.138 --> 50:18.492
The rest of us, we got some packing
to do. We're moving out.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.427
I need somebody
to drive bagman's truck.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.095
I want to be on the road in an hour.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.348
Let's get organised.

50:23.395 --> 50:25.886
We got to load up all the bikes.
Who's gonna drive what.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.376
Bobbie, come help me with the tents.
We're gonna strike them right now.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.981
- All right.
- Let's go.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.066
I'll drive the truck.

50:36.742 --> 50:39.859
You better stay,
see what you can do.

50:39.995 --> 50:41.155
I got some ideas.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.079
No! Nol

50:44.208 --> 50:45.618
nol

50:45.751 --> 50:48.288
- you wanted a witness? Huh?
- What about me? Mel!

50:48.420 --> 50:51.002
You wanted a witness?
Around here, they don't count for much!

50:51.131 --> 50:54.919
All you gotta do is tell me to send out
for your boys with the money!

50:55.052 --> 50:56.883
That's what you gotta do!

50:57.012 --> 50:59.879
Don't hit him no more.

51:00.015 --> 51:02.176
Ok?

51:07.481 --> 51:10.063
- Bagman.
- What?

51:10.192 --> 51:13.400
- You ok, man?
- I'm all right.

51:23.664 --> 51:25.700
Sheriff's up in loyal gorge,
fishing, Julie.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.994
Oh, lord.

51:28.127 --> 51:29.412
What's the problem?

51:29.545 --> 51:33.037
Oh, I could call over at the jail.
Jess or somebody'd be over there.

51:33.173 --> 51:36.165
No. No, that's ok.
We'll just forget about it.

51:36.302 --> 51:40.045
- Er..how far is this loyal...
- Loyal gorge. 60 miles. 80 maybe.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.593
What's the problem?
You in some kind of trouble, Julie?

51:43.726 --> 51:45.216
No, I'm not in any kind of trouble.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.468
Er... we just needed to see
the sheriff, that's all.

51:47.605 --> 51:49.015
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.

51:49.148 --> 51:53.232
Julie Dean! You don't just come
around banging on people's doors

51:53.360 --> 51:55.271
at four o'clock in the morning!

51:55.404 --> 51:57.924
What the hell you doing up
at four o'clock in the morning anyway?

51:57.948 --> 51:59.358
Sorry, sorry.

51:59.491 --> 52:00.594
Oh, you kids is always up to something.

52:00.618 --> 52:01.824
Good night.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.943
No damn good. I knowed you
since was a tadpole.

52:04.079 --> 52:06.991
- Take your bike. You got gas, man?
- Yeah, I think I got enough.

52:07.124 --> 52:10.036
- There's some all-nighters on I-79.
- See you all later.

52:13.255 --> 52:17.715
Since when you messing around
motorcycles, Julie Dean?

52:17.843 --> 52:20.630
You could die on them things!

52:20.763 --> 52:23.049
Them things is damnable. Damnable!

52:33.859 --> 52:37.443
Look, even if you're pissed off at me,
would you please talk to me?

52:37.571 --> 52:39.402
I gotta keep awake.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.863
I'm not pissed off.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.778
I don't know what I am.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.869
I don't know what I am, remember?

52:47.998 --> 52:50.740
As you helped me realise back there
in front of everybody.

52:52.586 --> 52:56.625
What about you? You're not
on such solid grounds, you know.

52:56.757 --> 53:00.170
Morgan dumps on you all the time. He
cheats on you every chance he gets.

53:00.302 --> 53:02.072
He's probably back there
with somebody right now.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.929
God! I asked you to talk to me!
I don't want to hear this shit!

53:05.057 --> 53:08.299
God damn it! You can say anything.
You can say anything you want to.

53:08.435 --> 53:09.954
But nobody can say
anything back to you!

53:09.978 --> 53:14.312
That was just being mean, pip, and
you know it. I was not being mean!

53:14.441 --> 53:16.432
Jesus.

53:27.079 --> 53:30.663
Sometimes you don't know
where your life's going.

53:30.791 --> 53:33.282
Sometimes I feel like
I don't fit in anywhere.

53:42.803 --> 53:46.216
God damn it, ange,
I do think you're screwed up.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.088
You hang around that jerk Morgan

53:48.225 --> 53:50.225
just because you think
nobody else wants to schtoop

53:50.269 --> 53:52.134
a woman with grease on her face.

53:52.271 --> 53:54.102
But you don't even wipe the grease off.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.940
- Schtoop?
- Schtoop.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.811
It's a perfectly good word.
I think you know what it means.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.438
Well, if I wipe the grease off,
will you schtoop me, my dear?

54:04.575 --> 54:08.067
No, I wouldn't.
I'd rather boff boys.

54:08.203 --> 54:10.114
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

54:11.665 --> 54:13.951
Ok.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.075
Steve! My god, that's Steve!

54:24.511 --> 54:27.674
Steve! Where the hell have you been?

54:27.806 --> 54:29.387
We've called every motel in Lawrence.

54:29.516 --> 54:33.509
I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd ride on
and meet y'all in Bakersfield.

54:33.645 --> 54:36.057
All right, what the hell's wrong?

54:36.190 --> 54:39.182
Nothing's wrong! Billy's in jail!

54:39.318 --> 54:43.732
He's got a broken neck!
But nothing's wrong, Steve!

54:43.864 --> 54:45.650
Y'all are a wacky bunch, all right!

54:45.783 --> 54:49.776
That's our lawyer, right?
God, are we in trouble.

54:51.038 --> 54:55.122
You simple-minded
pea-brain lump of cow paddy!

54:55.250 --> 54:57.662
I get to go up to loyal gorge
once or twice a season,

54:57.795 --> 55:00.582
and you, you dim-witted numb...

55:10.098 --> 55:12.180
You better be looking out for me, man.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.675
Keep one eye on the door,
wherever you are, cos some day

55:14.812 --> 55:18.475
I'm gonna ride in there
and I'm gonna wipe you out.

55:19.399 --> 55:21.559
- Let's go, let's go. Come on, Billy.
- You understand?

55:21.610 --> 55:24.022
- Come on, Billy!
- I'm gonna wipe you out!

55:24.154 --> 55:26.736
- You fat...
- Come on!

55:26.865 --> 55:29.527
All right, all right.

55:31.411 --> 55:34.198
- Come on, Billy!
- I'm gonna wipe you out, man!

55:34.331 --> 55:36.242
Hey, come on!

55:43.215 --> 55:47.003
'5-42' - 'go ahead.'

56:15.122 --> 56:18.159
That's cos of me, isn't it?

57:00.959 --> 57:02.665
- Where you going?
- Lawrence!

57:02.794 --> 57:04.856
- What about the others?
- They went on ahead last night.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.620
Lin took 'em on ahead to Lawrence.

57:06.757 --> 57:10.090
I told her to wait. I told her, I told
everybody to wait till I got back.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.779
I told 'em to set up camp
and wait till I got back.

57:11.803 --> 57:14.169
Nobody goes anywhere in this outfit
without my permission.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.922
That's it! That's enough!

57:18.060 --> 57:23.271
I ain't gonna listen to this, man,
not after last night.

57:23.398 --> 57:27.107
You wanted the Bakersfield jail,
you got it, baby.

58:02.020 --> 58:06.389
Hi. I'm Sheila farrow,
wcap in Washington DC,

58:06.525 --> 58:08.231
and this is Judy rawis.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.600
Ses ee

58:09.736 --> 58:13.069
- and this is Joseph...
- Bontempi.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.689
Joe bontempi.

58:15.826 --> 58:18.909
It means good time in Italian.

58:20.163 --> 58:24.702
I'm not with Sheila here.
Tried to be, but couldn't score.

58:24.835 --> 58:27.872
I got other business.
You know about it?

58:28.046 --> 58:30.332
Well, I talked to Steve lock about it.

58:30.465 --> 58:33.878
Silver bullet enterprises.
Entertainment company out of DC.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.344
We book Vegas mostly, but we send
our people all over the country.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.383
Now, we're all together
on the insurance, right?

58:39.516 --> 58:41.928
- Yeah, man stopped by yesterday.
- Steve?

58:42.060 --> 58:43.997
- Yeah, hell of a nice feller.
- Yeah, he's great.

58:44.021 --> 58:47.889
- You're not a real priest, are you?
- You're goddamn right.

58:48.025 --> 58:51.609
No, just kidding.
No, I couldn't have any fun.

58:52.279 --> 58:54.757
You're trying to sell these kids.
We don't even know who they are.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.818
- Yeah, well, that makes us even.
- Oh, no.

58:57.951 --> 59:02.320
I mean, are you just hanging posters
or are you actually with the group?

59:02.456 --> 59:04.538
- We're part of the group.
- Good.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.202
Where can we find Billy Davis?

59:06.334 --> 59:07.915
- Billy's not here yet.
- Uh-huh?

59:08.045 --> 59:13.085
Oh, Sheila! My prayers
have been answered.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.958
I do a little spotting
for several magazines.

59:16.094 --> 59:20.258
I figure if I can get some
great colour stills... I don't know.

59:20.390 --> 59:23.310
Anyway, that's why Judy's here. But
that's not my first order of business.

59:23.435 --> 59:27.144
You see, I will be producing a piece
that we're going to shoot in brower.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.480
Now, we feel there's a good chance
for the network to pick it up.

59:30.609 --> 59:32.045
Wait a minute.
Are you talking about TV?

59:32.069 --> 59:33.354
Of course.

59:33.487 --> 59:36.229
- Tuck, you know about this?
- No, I don't.

59:36.364 --> 59:37.900
- Hi. Louis Tucker.
- Hi

59:38.033 --> 59:41.651
better known as friar tuck,
god's humble servant.

59:41.787 --> 59:44.369
Also known as the, er... funky friar.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.204
Ooh! Get down, get down!

59:46.333 --> 59:48.995
Yes, well, you see,
I thought I'd come ahead

59:49.127 --> 59:52.039
and kind of plug into
what your little group is all about.

59:52.172 --> 59:55.209
- But Billy Davis isn't in town yet.
- Oh!

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.878
Hey, Morgan, these are TV people.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.972
Er... not me. Uh, Joe bontempi.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.934
Silver bullet incorporated.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:10.475
Anyway, they're looking for Billy.
I guess Steve set all this up.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.347
Billy's in jail.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:16.193
- Are you serious?
- He might not make the show.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:21.566
But, er... he's the star, isn't he?

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.613
- We can handle it without him.
- No problem.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.038
That's great.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.907
My friend and I here
are gonna sell you tickets.

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.658
Don't forget to say hi to the bird.
They love that.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:17.788
You want a ticket, leave your name
out here in front of the courthouse, ok?

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.484
You're gonna love the show, I tell you!

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.509
I'm gonna come back. I'll trade you
that ice-cream cone for a ticket.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.174
How much you having?

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.138
Hey, mister, get on down here!
Buy a ticket!

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:28.757
This is the greatest show on wheels.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:31.636
Meet me in front of the courthouse!

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.636
Yeah, yeah, see that?

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.265
You can't miss this ride.
The concept's...

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.841
Well, shoot!

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.599
You sprung him.
I'm missing out on all the fun this trip.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:55.719
How you doing, Steve?

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.306
Ah. Ooh.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:02.855
My god. What hit you,
the Pittsburgh steelers?

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:05.229
No. Bakersfield cowboys.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.866
- Merl, you got any edibles on board?
- Some, yeah.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.826
I'll tell you what,
I didn't sleep last night,

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:16.164
and I don't think I can turn around
and make it back to Lawrence.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.973
I... I was thinking about taking some grub

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.981
and finding a place to camp out
around here somewhere.

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:24.499
Wa-oh-za-Bo-zee-ooh! Ow!
That don't sound half bad.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:27.091
We haven't had any sleep ourselves.
Let's look for a spot.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.698
Steve, if you guys
are gonna camp out,

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.283
- let me take your bike into Lawrence.
- Nah.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:31.534
You can ride in
with these guys tomorrow.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:35.847
Nah. You ain't taking no long ride
on a bike, till that neck stitches.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.812
- Merl, I just want to get back.
- Hey!

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.555
You gonna cool off and take it easy,

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:44.025
or do I have to shoot you
full of something?

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:54.403
This guy wants to handle us? What
do you mean, he wants to handle us?

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.825
I thought that's what you did.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:01.539
Yeah, I can get you into Lawrence.
I can get you into brower, even.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:05.710
But... but I don't know the big circuit.
I'd still be with you for legal and all.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:06.877
The big circuit?

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.752
You're gonna pull 15k out of brower.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.638
You could pull 30 or 40
out of some of these big county fairs.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:17.009
Hell, Billy, I can't even get
those folks on the telephone.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:20.808
They book acts from guys like this guy
that they've been dealing with all along.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.976
We're not an act.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:28.149
Yeah. Well, neither's bull-roping,
you know what I mean?

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.925
You do three or four
of these big gigs a summer,

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.861
you can do whatever the hell
you wanna for the rest of the year.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:36.657
Hell, this guy's talking about setting
you up with all fancy new costumes.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.434
He's even talking
about setting up some deal

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.618
with some cycle manufacturer.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.997
I'm surprised you even brought
this guy around, Steve.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:46.838
Well, damn it, Billy,
I'm just trying to help you along.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.796
You guys is the most fun I get in my life.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.921
I just don't want to see you all break up.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.934
Damn it, Billy, you're all stone broke
most of the time.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.429
And you take in every damn long hair

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.043
that knows how to make
a pair of sandals,

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.934
and you wanna pick up
the blue cross tab?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.910
Do you have the slightest idea
what gas is selling for, or two-by-fours,

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.363
or hamburger, or anything else?

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.983
You think it's breaking up?

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.406
It's money, Billy.
It's all to do with money.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:25.582
Money makes the world go round,
even your world.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.004
No.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:29.964
It's just getting too tough.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.630
It's tough to live by the code.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.380
I mean it's real hard to live
for something that you believe in.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.393
People try it
and then they get tired of it,

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:45.639
like they get tired of their diets,

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:50.109
or exercise, or their marriage,

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.320
or their kids,

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:56.031
or their job, or themselves,

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:00.074
or they get tired of their god.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.937
You can keep the money
you make off this sick world, lawyer.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.327
I don't want any part of it.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:11.127
Anybody who wants to live more for
themselves, he doesn't belong with us.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.946
Let him go out and buy some pimpy
psychiatrist's paperback says it's ok.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.804
Don't ask me to say it's ok.
It's not ok.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.430
Once I was in a jail in Alabama,

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:29.399
and I got my ass kicked
just like I did last night,

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.018
only then it was because
I was a nigger lover.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.929
Well, I woke up in the morning...

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:42.411
And I didn't even have energy
enough to lick my wounds.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.747
I found out I'd given up.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.539
So, I tried to kill myself.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:55.296
Tried to cut my wrist
with a bed spring. Ha-ha-hal!

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.967
See, I found out that
I'd given up on it all

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.762
because of where I was,
what was all around me.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:08.685
Well, last night, I get my ass kicked
and I came up laughing,

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.101
because now I'm in Camelot.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:17.986
You see, the way I see it
is this. You got two separate fights.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:21.575
The one for truth and justice and
the American way of life and all that,

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:24.366
that's gotta take a back seat
to the one for staying alive.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.161
You gotta stay alive.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.730
Man, you can have the most beautiful
ideals in the whole world.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:32.245
But if you die, your ideals
are gonna die with you.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:35.957
The important thing is
we gotta stay together.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.301
We gotta keep this troop together.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.760
And if keeping the troop going

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.129
means that we have to take
some of this promoter's money,

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.683
well, then I say let's take it
and get some sleep.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.073
Hey, get rid of that grass
before we get into camp tomorrow.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:11.993
I don't want that shit around.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.915
- Bagman.
- Huh? Oh.

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:55.582
Shh. Listen, I've been thinking
about what you said.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:56.835
That stuff you said earlier?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:00.174
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it real hard.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.042
- There's not two different fights.
- What?

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.532
There can't be two different fights.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:07.424
You've got to fight for your ideals,
and if you die, your ideals don't die.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.892
The code that we're living by
is the troop.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.229
The troop is our code.
I can't let people walk on that idea.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.600
- Billy.
- I can't!

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:31.788
- What the hell's going on?
- Billy's using your bike.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:03.738
- Where's the wine?
- Here.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.242
But you get your food and your supplies.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.058
And it is right that everybody gets
the same amount of spending money.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:12.351
All the decisions are made here.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.208
But the merchants,
they're like serfs, you know.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:18.453
- Only the knights can make decisions.
- The king makes the final decision.

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:21.205
On the advice of the knights.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:25.335
We could all take in a little more cash
if we didn't spend so much on weapons.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.871
Yeah, and a lot less on parts, too.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.338
Ah, our king.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.760
- Billy Davis?
- Himself.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:34.477
Oh, yeah, the
goddamned knights have it the cushiest.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:35.765
My god, he's hurt.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.307
I mean we all understand
they're big brave machos,

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.844
but things are getting out of hand!

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.189
They don't care what they smash up.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:46.985
We blow five bikes a week, parts
cost a fortune, and those lances!

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:48.804
Then they let the townies
ride with the stuff!

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:51.490
Hey, look, you don't like it?

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.658
Get out!

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.857
Do you think the people...
Do you think the people show up here

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.247
to buy your goddamn jewellery?

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:03.873
Your pots, your corn?

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.321
Why don't you go sell them
in some shopping mall somewhere?

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.381
I just spent last night in jail

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.631
with a man who got his head beat in
for something he believed in!

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:15.101
And if you don't believe in it,
then get the hell out of here!

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.062
You don't know what we were
talking about. All we were saying is...

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.773
What is this?
What is this? A council meeting?

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.235
Huh? This is a council meeting.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:30.275
You cannot have a council meeting
without everybody being here!

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:33.744
You cannot have a council meeting
without everyone being here!

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:38.116
Oh, go shove
your goddamn council meeting!

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.459
Yeah?

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:43.188
Yeah? That's... that's a 20 dollar fine.
That is a 20 dollar fine.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.856
You can pay me right now or you can
get your ass right out of here.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.380
Oh, man.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.838
We're already gone, Billy.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:55.634
Hey, Billy, we're just trying to get
some things together for you, man.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.635
Where's Merlin?

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.896
Merlin's not here.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.690
I'm not here.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:12.610
Lin, you know this. You know...
Where's tuck? Where the hell is tuck?

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.366
Now this is a picture I'd like to get.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.084
My photographer caught
with her pants down.

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:24.670
I'll drink to that.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:31.340
Whoa!

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:32.837
Stop it!

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.016
Let me help. That's too low.

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:40.011
You got it all over you.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.538
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:04.036
There's a council meeting
going on out there.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.169
Who are you?

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.543
Who's she?

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.865
- Are you with that guy out there?
- Yes.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.221
Are you with that guy
in the suit out there? Huh?

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.349
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.965
On!

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:23.555
Shut the door!

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:31.984
Ah, shit.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:34.357
Hi.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.488
I didn't order this!

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:41.910
Lin, I wanna talk to you.

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:46.127
I wouldn't take it personally, Joe.
You know how talent feels about agents.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.747
Christ, he's a lunatic! Look at this!

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:52.091
I came all the way out here
to talk to him!

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:55.302
The man does not work for me!

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:58.719
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Joe.
This one's much better-looking.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.388
It can't be done, lin.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.305
This

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.649
this can't be done.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.993
I took a major chance in my life
to do this.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.869
I'd just gotten to the point
where I'd given up on fantasies.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.872
I gave up on fantasies a long time ago.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.422
And then you show up...

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.009
With this fantasy-intense dream.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:48.147
I wanted you, not your dream.

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:54.069
But enough of that dream
rubbed off on me.

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:58.858
I'm vulnerable again.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.537
And now you tell me it can't be done?

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.578
I could have told you that two years ago.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.131
Two years.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.847
You're still here.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.092
I'm here.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:32.518
I don't know if it's because of you
any more, Billy, but I'm here.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.963
Hey, what's your problem?

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:56.878
Hey!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.015
Hey, bad news.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.876
- What's wrong?
- It looks really like trouble.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.266
A lot of these local guys
came in all duded up.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:16.644
Some made their own armour. Bad.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.067
So, er... we'll see you guys in DC?

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.065
Now, you're sure you can get the riders?

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:22.471
Because I'm gonna work right now.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.157
- Bookings, costumes, publicity.
- I can get the riders, right?

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:28.406
This here is...

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:31.605
All right, all right. You know, this is
looking a lot better than I had hoped.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:35.622
You see, the smaller the group,
the juicier the split.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.464
Just like big rock groups.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.709
You, see, a big group,
nobody makes any money.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:43.508
I handle small groups only.
There's more bread.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.552
They are happier.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:49.176
And if they are happy, I am happy,

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.813
my brother, are you happy?

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.063
What's your name again?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.076
- Marhalt.
- Marhalt. No, I mean your real name.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:01.147
- Marhalt.
- Right.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:07.911
Hey, bors, who's the dude?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.996
- Some promoter from DC, man.
- Excuse me.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.458
Morgan and a bunch of guys,
they're leaving with him.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:13.866
Half the group's going, I swear.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:16.583
- Could you stop that for now, ok?
- Right.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:19.377
Half the group's leaving, I swear it.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.752
- Alan, I think I'm gonna pull out.
- Look, I asked you to stop that.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.174
That is professional equipment.
Let go!

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.093
Good. Go take some pictures of birds.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.557
Hey, she's ok. She's my friend.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.802
The beauty is really a beast.

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.724
I just told her you were a nice guy.

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:36.020
- Hey, bors, you pulling out?
- Yeah.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.188
Billy's out of commission.
Everybody's cutting.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.402
We're not gonna make brower.
There's no bread.

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:45.738
Nah, man. That guy's a real asshole
he's going with.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:50.159
I don't know. I'm just gonna...
I don't know, just ride out of here.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.283
The whole thing's over, man.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.747
I've made a decision.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:03.422
When this thing is over today
I'm taking off with this guy.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:08.423
I mean, he's offering me the world
and this is rapidly going into the toilet.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:11.801
And I deserve to be king
so I'm forming my own kingdom.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:16.018
Pardon me, but you didn't win the right.
You didn't win the crown.

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.390
Oh, geez, come on.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:20.359
I beat Billy in Bakersfield.
I've been beating him regularly.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:22.773
And I don't want his crown.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.740
That's a crown of thorns,
if you know what I mean.

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:29.031
Look, maybe I'm missing
something here, you know?

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:31.654
I mean, if this breaks...
When this breaks up...

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:37.160
You know, I'm like you, a trade school
dropout. I mean, I love these bikes.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.708
These bikes make me very happy
and I love what I do.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.172
Pardon me, but you also love yourself.

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:44.132
Well, that's not so bad, either.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.252
You should try it some time.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.674
- You bastard.
- See?

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:51.674
I gotta love myself.
Everybody else thinks I'm a bastard.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.146
- I need a mechanic.
- No.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.032
If I'm gonna sit around
and wait for you at night,

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:07.276
I might as well be
where I have my friends.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.262
I mean, at least I can get up
a game of cards or something.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.026
Now, see, why do you do that?

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.350
Why do you make yourself out
to be such a loser all the time?

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.285
I'm not the loser, Morgan.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.204
There's nobody
I'm interested in right now but you.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.373
But some day there's gonna be,

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:24.465
and that's the gamble you take
every time you go away.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:28.919
He'll be back. They'll all be back.
I give it two weeks.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.139
God damn you!

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:36.352
How can you be so blind about
everything in your life? Mor...

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.268
Can't you understand? This isn't
just a roadside carny any more.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:42.392
Not for some of us, anyway.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:45.065
It's a lot more than that.
It's a whole lot more.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.030
If you can't get some sort
of spiritual fix out of this,

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:51.400
then... then you belong
with that loudmouth hype artist.

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.451
Damn it!

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.804
And so, my... my lords and ladies,

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.980
the noble sir ban will ride
against the Valiant dame rocky.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.977
- Shit!
- Rocky and ban.

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:11.114
It's all right.
Will she get through just one more?

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.732
- Yeah, one more, but that's about it.
- That's all she wrote.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:17.487
And to us, my lords and ladies, the
champion of the day is truly a champion,

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:20.285
- honoured and rewarded.
- Ah!

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.978
There is a purse for the champion,

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.322
- but more importantly...
- Jesus!

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.543
Until the next games, he will sit at
an honoured place in the king's favour,

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:30.381
for being champion of the games
is no small thing to a knight.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:42.261
Does this mean I don't have
to do dishes tonight, my liege?

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:02.240
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, hand weapons.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:03.741
Your choice.

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.459
- Joe.
- Don't put up the rail.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:07.690
- Here you go.
- Don't put up the rail.

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:10.330
What the hell's going on around here?

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.275
- I can't raise my arm, Merlin.
- Sit right down there.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:35.408
Aah!

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:39.402
- Hey, they getting too rough out there.
- Shit, it's out of control.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.871
Well, er... rocky and ban
seem to be a little...

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.580
What difference does it make?

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:51.877
Trumpets!

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.379
Are you leaving with the rest of them?

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:33.839
No.

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:36.674
Would you get back up there, please?

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:39.169
Ok.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.137
Thanks.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.562
I'll go in for you, if you want.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:56.986
You'd do that for me, wouldn't you?

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.946
Sure.

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:05.115
I won't be nearly as good as you.

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.331
My god.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.901
Music! Music! Music!

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:40.439
Music! Music! Music! Music!

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.971
All right, come on, you guys.
Start the music, huh? Let's go.

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:46.032
- Music! Music!
- Come on, look alive, look alive.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:48.780
Noble knights.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.000
These brave fighters.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:57.335
Brave fighters who...

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:00.002
They're gonna kill each other.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:14.439
God damn.

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:19.353
It's two years' worth of grudges,
Morgan. It's their last shot.

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:30.114
- They're crazy.
- Yeah, they are. They're crazy.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:31.956
You see,
that's what makes them sellable.

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:44.170
She won! Rocky won!
My lords and...

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.547
Oh, my god, the bike.

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.015
The bike!

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:53.474
Jennifer!

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:02.230
Come on, get back, get back.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:04.106
Oh, Jesus!

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.153
Somebody get me a stretcher!

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.431
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Everything is under control.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:10.411
Please, now... now just stay
where you are.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.326
Get back! Come on! Get back!

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:19.295
Normally, we do invite people from the
town to compete against the knights,

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:22.541
but obviously today we will not do that.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:29.215
You guys picked
the wrong day to get cute.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:40.400
Let's go play too, huh?

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:44.192
This is your lucky day, sweetheart.
I got a lot of energy after a big fight.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.906
- Oh, I'm counting on that.
- Mm-hm.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.990
- All right.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.244
Go for it!

01:27:42.048 --> 01:27:45.006
Give me my Lance. Thank you.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.585
If we get out of this alive,
will you be my lover?

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.371
Yes!

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.380
Well, we just married on radio.

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:46.943
On!

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.601
- I got this guy!
- No, Alan.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:08.191
I've been waiting for this guy
for a long time, man.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:16.571
He can't fight! He's hurt bad.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:18.534
Take me!

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:34.175
Jesus, Billy! What are you doing?

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:37.171
If you refuse to fight, then yield!

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.514
Get off the field! This battle is mine!

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:43.511
I'm not gonna fight youl!
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.078
Holy shit! Is that real?

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.174
All right, damn it! Come on!

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:54.998
Yield.

01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:58.844
I don't want to hurt you any more.
You have to yield.

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:47.638
Oh! Are you ok?

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.267
Give him some water. Here, sip.

01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:57.394
Look at me. Oh.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:00.897
Blood.

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:09.288
Shit.

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:56.698
I just need some time, lin.

01:35:56.876 --> 01:36:00.084
I gotta get out of here for a while.

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:02.291
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:06.708
I just need to take a ride.

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.278
Sheriff was by.

01:37:13.411 --> 01:37:15.823
Said that woman's gonna be all right.

01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:20.866
Well, thank the lord for something.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:24.119
What's the matter, Steve?
You afraid the premium was going up?

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.139
Beat the blackbird, magician.

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:49.064
Kicked his round ass square.
Don't know if you beat him.

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:53.864
Did they go?

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:01.705
We'll just have to wait and see.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:08.171
Steve? If you would...

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:11.917
Could you find out, er...
How long we can stay here?

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:14.760
How much it'd cost us?

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:23.557
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:11.184
- How you doing, Luke?
- I don't believe it!

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:15.063
- I just don't believe it!
- Sam, how you doing?

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:17.030
- Hi, Alan.
- You guys look great.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.697
- Yeah?
- You look just great.

01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:21.694
Who are these guys?

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:24.163
Well, that's Dylan and this is Morgan.

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:27.659
Oh, wow. Another Morgan.
That's all we need, man.

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.995
Geez, I haven't seen you guys
since I left st Vincent's.

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.544
I didn't even know
if you'd still be up here for sure.

01:39:34.677 --> 01:39:35.962
Oh, we're here forever.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:38.882
Well, we're here for a couple of days.

01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:40.117
- Think you can handle it?
- Sure.

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:42.632
Do you think we can handle that?
Come on inside. Come on.

01:39:42.768 --> 01:39:45.134
- Aah!
- Come on.

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.831
- See you guys later.
- Yeah, all right.

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:47.939
Come on in here.

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:53.564
Oh, nice, nice.
I give you a three-five, Morgan.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.778
And he can dive, too?

01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:01.150
Give me... dope!

01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:03.824
Don't get it wet.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.670
Hey! All right!

01:40:13.799 --> 01:40:16.757
Hey! What is going on here?

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:19.172
- What is this?
- This is it!

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:22.092
This is decadent.
This is Washington DC decadence.

01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:24.011
- I love it.
- All right!

01:40:24.143 --> 01:40:26.304
- Did I promise you good times?
- You did!

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:28.165
- You did so!
- Well, ok! Well, oki

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.475
say hi to Jeannie over here.
That's Sheila.

01:40:30.608 --> 01:40:31.814
- That's Judy.
- Hil

01:40:31.943 --> 01:40:33.479
- that's tuck.
- Looking good.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:36.318
- And there's Morgan.
- I'm going inside.

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:37.966
- Well, come on in.
- Yeah, in a minute.

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:39.605
Would you fix me a drink, please?

01:40:39.742 --> 01:40:43.576
- What would you like?
- Anything. Triple anything.

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:46.696
Hey. Er... saw the armour. It looks great.

01:40:46.832 --> 01:40:49.436
It's not gonna be ready for a couple
of weeks, though. It doesn't matter.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.900
I got a great suit for you
for tomorrow for the photo session.

01:40:52.088 --> 01:40:54.750
That's am, paisan.
I want you awake and looking good.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.588
He always looks good.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.924
Hey, er... and everything's ok
with the bikes, too.

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:02.591
Take delivery on Wednesday.
Wait till you see 'em.

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:06.716
Gorgeous. Custom designed.
Wait till you see the hummers, man.

01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:08.058
Morgan, before you go,

01:41:08.187 --> 01:41:11.600
what I need from you is your signature
on just a few documents.

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.313
Insurance forms.

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:15.629
It's just so you don't sue us
if you fall off your bike, you know?

01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:18.440
You got workman's comp there.
I'll talk to you later, all right?

01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:21.531
Hey, Joe.
I ook at this. You see this?

01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:23.445
We had a child while you were gone.

01:41:23.578 --> 01:41:25.489
Say hi to Joe. He's the boss.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:28.363
Baby love Joe!

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:31.616
Joe smooth!

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:35.495
I gotta get rid of tuck.

01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:50.723
Oh, Jesus.

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:53.478
You really are a hunk.

01:41:55.276 --> 01:41:58.484
Oh, god. I wish he wasn't coming back.

01:41:58.613 --> 01:42:00.854
Er... you wish he wasn't coming back?

01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:03.652
Louis, the guy I live with.

01:42:06.245 --> 01:42:08.907
Ah!

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.077
Now what the hell did you expect?

01:42:12.209 --> 01:42:16.669
You didn't think I could afford
all this myself, did you?

01:42:23.512 --> 01:42:26.629
Need a little attitude right here.

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:30.179
Quiet, please. Look that way.

01:42:34.523 --> 01:42:35.683
Yeah, look up here.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.432
I ook at him like he's real hot.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.982
He is real hot.

01:42:42.114 --> 01:42:43.425
Morgan,
you look right in here, ok?

01:42:43.449 --> 01:42:45.906
Hey, Morgan,
when's our turn, man?

01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:47.137
Now don't be greedy, now.

01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:50.028
Morgan. Morgan, please concentrate.
Thank you.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:54.749
- What are you doing after the shot?
- Ok, everybody think medieval sex.

01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:57.118
How come Judy can't shoot this stuff?

01:42:58.673 --> 01:43:01.335
But Judy can shoot this stuff.

01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:03.195
There's no point
in Judy shooting this stuff.

01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:05.084
This is not documentary work.

01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:07.587
What she does is documentary work,
which is...

01:43:07.723 --> 01:43:09.463
This is studio work. This is...

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.119
- You've done studio, haven't you?
- Uh-huh.

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:12.621
- What do you think of it?
- I love my work.

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:16.058
Well, look at it. It's porn. That's...
Look, see, they're set-up shots.

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:19.728
That's just... that's controlling the
environment. That's not real life, hm?

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.350
That's not real life.

01:43:21.487 --> 01:43:23.648
- There'll be work, all right?
- Mm. Ok.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:26.739
- Trust me. Trust me.
- Mm-hm, I trust you. Yeah, ok.

01:43:36.836 --> 01:43:39.373
Great shot!

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:45.291
J it's a pity there's just emptiness

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:50.263
j but with sorrow there comes joy

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:55.761
j and I would rather die in a hurricane

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:59.514
j than to never know the storm...

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:06.445
J fears I know, I face them

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:11.238
j as my castle walls will fall

01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:19.370
j oh, but I would let
those castles tumble

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:26.423
j or I'd never love at all...

01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:30.966
- Keep playing.
- New song.

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:34.306
It's not finished yet.
I'll play it for you some day.

01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:53.029
How long are we gonna stay here?

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:57.078
The rent's paid.

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:59.199
It's a nice place.

01:45:08.219 --> 01:45:10.335
Till they come back.

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:13.133
- You think they're coming back?
- Yes.

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:16.094
I don't know, man.
Maybe some of them.

01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:17.227
They'll all come back.

01:45:17.394 --> 01:45:19.259
Well

01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:25.813
I know it's important to me, like
for us, to all still be here, you know?

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:28.903
But I'm not sure about them.

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:32.273
It's important for them, too.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:35.446
Those guys, the stray sheep...

01:45:37.248 --> 01:45:39.534
That's all I think about.

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:42.079
I got nothing left to give.
I take you all for granted.

01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:43.951
I don't give you anything.

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:46.875
Man, you give us everything, man.

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:49.214
You give us, you know, a chance.

01:45:56.392 --> 01:45:58.223
Yeah, but I don't pay you any attention.

01:46:03.065 --> 01:46:05.226
I'm sorry about that.

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:08.066
Play your song, will you?

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:11.608
- Yeah, it's like... it's not finished yet.
- Well, finish it.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:14.823
Instant song.

01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:17.364
Nah, I'll play it for you some day.

01:46:18.497 --> 01:46:20.488
I promise.

01:46:23.252 --> 01:46:25.083
Good.

01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:58.905
I think that what Alan does
is... is, er... hero stuff.

01:46:59.038 --> 01:47:00.118
Certainly more so than not.

01:47:00.164 --> 01:47:06.034
I think what Alan does is, er...
Anarchistic and rebellious,

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:08.035
to say nothing of the violence.

01:47:08.172 --> 01:47:11.164
- What do you think hero stuff is?
- I don't know.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.758
I guess, you know, like old movies
Brando was a part of.

01:47:14.887 --> 01:47:16.593
Brando?

01:47:16.722 --> 01:47:19.304
Brando's anti-anti-antihero.

01:47:19.433 --> 01:47:21.173
What about Brando in "the wild one"?

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:24.143
That's very close to Alan's
kind of thing, "the wild one".

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:27.388
There you have antihero as hero.

01:47:27.524 --> 01:47:29.685
I think I got you there.

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:33.102
I'm not, er...

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:37.857
Anti-anti-antihero.

01:47:37.993 --> 01:47:41.110
I'm just, er... anti-anti-chicken.

01:47:41.997 --> 01:47:44.989
Remember that night
in a restaurant in a garden,

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:49.539
waiter comes to my table and
he says, "kid, this ain't your night.

01:47:49.672 --> 01:47:52.084
"We just ran out of fish.
You'll have to eat the chicken."

01:47:52.216 --> 01:47:56.050
Hey! Hey, come on!
Can't we go and party or something?

01:47:56.178 --> 01:47:59.170
You was my brother, Charlie.

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.951
You should have
looked out for me a little bit.

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:02.590
You should have looked out for me

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:04.967
so I wouldn't have to be stuck
with a bad piece of meat.

01:48:05.104 --> 01:48:07.311
I gotta go.

01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:10.476
- I love you. Shit, what can I say?
- All right.

01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:12.770
We got something to do.

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:18.522
I coulda had class!

01:48:47.062 --> 01:48:49.053
Oh, man.

01:48:51.316 --> 01:48:53.807
I really don't understand this.

01:48:56.739 --> 01:48:58.024
I know you don't.

01:48:58.157 --> 01:48:59.943
Oh.

01:49:00.075 --> 01:49:02.066
I'm sorry.

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:38.067
On!

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:47.991
Oh...

01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:52.287
Fuck.

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:56.207
I know what you're saying,
but... what? What?

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.921
Hey!

01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:01.087
Oh, man.
Where the hell have you been?

01:50:07.684 --> 01:50:10.300
Oh, shit, Morgan. Bad craziness.

01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:59.308
There can be only one king, Morgan.

01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:03.608
You can't just split off and start over
again whenever you want.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.072
We both know that inside.

01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:10.114
There can only be one king
at one time.

01:51:10.289 --> 01:51:12.245
That's the law.

01:52:32.037 --> 01:52:35.529
- J going home
- J ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba

01:52:35.666 --> 01:52:39.454
- j we're going home
- J ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba...

01:52:53.767 --> 01:52:55.974
Billy.

01:52:56.103 --> 01:52:58.059
Hey, Billy.

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.542
Alan!

01:53:32.556 --> 01:53:34.421
Hi.

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:37.049
- Hi.
- I'm back.

01:53:57.789 --> 01:53:59.996
Urn...

01:54:03.628 --> 01:54:05.459
Stop it!

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.438
Billy?

01:54:34.618 --> 01:54:36.904
My king.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.198
If you'll allow me, I will fight for you
in defence of the crown.

01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:44.791
These others will challenge.

01:54:46.797 --> 01:54:48.913
Shit, I can't talk like that.

01:54:49.049 --> 01:54:50.289
Morgan's agreed to fight

01:54:50.425 --> 01:54:52.779
and if you promise to sit on your ass
and stay out of the way,

01:54:52.803 --> 01:54:55.966
there's still some of us
that'll fight for you.

01:54:57.182 --> 01:54:59.264
- All right.
- All right!

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:13.688
Hey! Come on! Let's go!
We've got a lot of work to do!

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:49.939
How in the hell can I tell you
how much it cost, huh?

01:55:50.068 --> 01:55:53.777
You cannot put a price on reputation.
My reputation is at stake.

01:55:53.905 --> 01:55:57.397
Look at that! That's grand larceny!
That's... that's Grand Theft Auto!

01:55:57.534 --> 01:55:59.820
- Oh, look. Look, look.
- Cycle! Grand theft cycle, man!

01:55:59.953 --> 01:56:02.239
- Which is worse!
- Let's bring it down a few steps.

01:56:02.372 --> 01:56:04.559
Let's just bring it down.
Now let's just talk like this.

01:56:04.583 --> 01:56:06.144
- Yeah, ok, fine, fine.
- All right? Now, look.

01:56:06.168 --> 01:56:08.375
The motel they smashed up,
now, they gave me a figure,

01:56:08.503 --> 01:56:11.290
and they were real happy and
business-like and co-operated with me.

01:56:11.423 --> 01:56:12.879
Now, all I'm asking from you is...

01:56:13.008 --> 01:56:16.000
What are you telling me?
You're telling me that the deal is off?

01:56:16.136 --> 01:56:17.864
That they don't have to
honour their commitments?

01:56:17.888 --> 01:56:19.699
- Look. Look! Look, look!
- They have signed contracts, man!

01:56:19.723 --> 01:56:22.681
If you want to know the future,
you'd better go talk to Merlin...

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.846
Because I sure as hell can't tell
who's gonna win or who's gonna lose.

01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:28.470
Alan wins, then Billy's still king.

01:56:28.607 --> 01:56:30.598
Lord knows what he's gonna do.

01:56:30.734 --> 01:56:32.065
Now, if Morgan wins,

01:56:32.194 --> 01:56:34.130
how in the hell am I supposed
to know what he's gonna do?

01:56:34.154 --> 01:56:35.940
Well, I don't care
who wins or loses, man!

01:56:36.072 --> 01:56:37.903
That's not my business!
I am not a bookie!

01:56:38.033 --> 01:56:40.149
Can I interest you in a screwdriver?

01:56:40.285 --> 01:56:42.446
- Try some knobs.
- Knobs? Ok.

01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:44.740
There are only about 24.

01:56:44.873 --> 01:56:46.454
Ow! Ow!

01:56:46.583 --> 01:56:48.949
- Jesus! Are you hurt?
- Forget it, forget it.

01:56:49.085 --> 01:56:51.076
Punch, punch!
Come on, sit down, sit down.

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:54.376
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Now, look,
you can figure it out better than I can.

01:57:06.728 --> 01:57:09.310
- What are you guys doing?
- Getting ready for you.

01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:14.308
I need a hack driver for tomorrow.
Got anybody?

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:17.105
Sure.

01:57:17.239 --> 01:57:19.730
Somebody from my side, on my side.

01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:24.321
- We play fair.
- Yeah, I know.

01:57:24.454 --> 01:57:26.410
Take green.

01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:29.118
Thanks.

01:57:34.965 --> 01:57:36.455
Oki

01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:39.458
- whoo! Bitching, bro!
- Ok, guy!

01:57:39.594 --> 01:57:41.255
Say no more!

01:57:50.146 --> 01:57:53.889
- What are the boundaries?
- No boundaries.

01:57:54.025 --> 01:57:56.061
Wherever it takes you.

01:57:58.989 --> 01:58:01.480
Ok. Now, this is a toughie.

01:58:01.616 --> 01:58:04.608
What constitutes surrender?

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.609
Surrender?

01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:09.700
You gonna surrender?

01:58:09.833 --> 01:58:11.949
Are you gonna surrender?

01:58:14.337 --> 01:58:16.794
Nobody's gonna surrender,

01:58:16.923 --> 01:58:21.417
and I don't think it's necessary
for anybody to get hurt bad.

01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:27.594
So, any knight separated
from his machine is out.

01:58:36.234 --> 01:58:38.896
Christ, I feel like
I caused the whole thing.

01:58:39.029 --> 01:58:42.613
Hey, hey, hey.
Steve, you didn't cause anything.

01:58:42.741 --> 01:58:45.198
- I caused it.
- That's right.

01:58:45.327 --> 01:58:47.158
See, Billy the king
turned around one day

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:50.654
and seen how many of us
was looking to him.

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.405
He say, "what's all this noise?

01:58:52.542 --> 01:58:57.582
"And what's all these folks
looking to me for?"

01:58:57.714 --> 01:59:00.922
They think you're trying to look bad,
trying to get your ass whooped.

01:59:01.051 --> 01:59:05.636
They think you're some little cat trying
to prove you don't deserve to be king.

01:59:05.764 --> 01:59:09.256
You're saying, "in you,
look past the mist,

01:59:09.392 --> 01:59:13.260
"see what you be, your own majesty,
don't try to find yourself in me.

01:59:13.396 --> 01:59:16.638
"I ain't that great, no-how.
Follow your own soul."

01:59:20.028 --> 01:59:21.859
Dig it.

01:59:52.602 --> 01:59:53.933
For the crown!

01:59:54.104 --> 01:59:57.141
The crown lives forever!

02:00:07.826 --> 02:00:11.239
These are
the weapons you have chosen.

02:00:12.956 --> 02:00:17.290
You may not
draw weapons from the rack.

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:21.161
Good luck.

02:00:52.537 --> 02:00:54.698
Oh, boy.

02:01:54.182 --> 02:01:56.013
God damn that bike!

02:01:58.102 --> 02:02:01.185
It's not your fault, it's not that...

02:02:06.361 --> 02:02:09.398
Come on, Joe, jump on it!

02:02:10.406 --> 02:02:12.863
Come on,
you dumb stupid-ass machine!

02:02:16.955 --> 02:02:18.991
Watch it, Alan!

02:02:28.925 --> 02:02:31.337
All right, bors! Yeah! Yeah!

02:04:17.158 --> 02:04:20.491
You're an asshole, ewing!
Oh, yeah? It's ewain, schmuck!

02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:22.156
Ah! Come on, let's get the...

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:24.449
- All right!
- Hey, hey, babe.

02:04:24.582 --> 02:04:27.369
Let's just keep it in the family.

02:04:30.004 --> 02:04:32.586
Basics, Morgan!
You forgot your basics!

02:04:32.715 --> 02:04:35.548
Ha-ha! Basics, rocky!

02:04:35.677 --> 02:04:37.258
Basics!

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.766
Look out, look out, look out!

02:04:49.899 --> 02:04:51.935
Rescue! Hey, ban!

02:04:54.278 --> 02:04:56.860
- Let's just keep moving, ok?
- All right.

02:06:02.513 --> 02:06:04.674
Driver! Rescue driver!

02:06:37.090 --> 02:06:39.001
What is that? Some kind of new move?

02:06:39.133 --> 02:06:42.250
Improvisation.
It was sheer improvisation.

02:06:42.386 --> 02:06:44.468
Come on, let's go.

02:06:46.224 --> 02:06:48.385
Come on! Get off the field!

02:06:48.518 --> 02:06:50.224
Come on!

02:07:00.905 --> 02:07:03.396
Come on!

02:07:59.797 --> 02:08:01.708
Alan!

02:11:41.227 --> 02:11:43.058
Morgan.

02:12:10.256 --> 02:12:12.167
You know those contracts?

02:12:15.428 --> 02:12:18.215
Burn 'em, baby.

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.884
Oh.

02:13:47.645 --> 02:13:50.853
I love you... my master.

02:13:52.942 --> 02:13:55.058
Goodbye.

02:15:50.893 --> 02:15:53.305
Oh! Ohl

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:09.111
On!

02:16:12.247 --> 02:16:14.329
Aaah!

02:17:36.248 --> 02:17:41.993
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

02:17:42.129 --> 02:17:45.370
and to the Republic for which it stands,

02:17:45.507 --> 02:17:47.998
one nation under god...

02:17:48.135 --> 02:17:51.127
Indivisible with Liberty and...

02:18:23.462 --> 02:18:25.043
Excuse me.

02:18:31.053 --> 02:18:33.465
All right, class.

02:18:33.597 --> 02:18:35.462
Class, please come to order.

02:21:18.595 --> 02:21:22.964
J sitting here alone in my father's home

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:27.935
j tomorrow I'll be leaving
I'll be on my own...

02:21:32.567 --> 02:21:36.901
J to the hills as a child I'll go

02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:41.364
j but I'd rather be a wanderer
than to never go at all...

02:21:51.545 --> 02:21:55.788
J in my soul a song lies sleeping

02:21:55.924 --> 02:21:57.789
j waiting to be born

02:21:57.926 --> 02:22:01.589
j I can hear weeping

02:22:05.517 --> 02:22:09.476
j deep inside I can feel her dance

02:22:09.646 --> 02:22:11.682
j go and run to me, lover

02:22:11.815 --> 02:22:16.309
4 touch my innocence...

02:22:19.281 --> 02:22:23.240
J I see that life is an open road

02:22:23.368 --> 02:22:29.284
j there'll be people who stay
there'll be people who go

02:22:29.416 --> 02:22:33.910
j I know at first it pains me so

02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:37.538
j to think I'm just learning how

02:22:40.635 --> 02:22:43.547
j tolet go...

02:22:57.903 --> 02:23:01.236
J it's a pity there's just emptiness

02:23:01.364 --> 02:23:05.778
j but with sorrow there comes joy

02:23:05.911 --> 02:23:11.156
j and I would rather die in a hurricane

02:23:11.291 --> 02:23:16.035
j than to never know the storm

02:23:17.464 --> 02:23:20.581
j fears I know, I face them

02:23:20.717 --> 02:23:26.087
j as my castle walls will fall

02:23:26.223 --> 02:23:32.389
j oh, but I would let
those castles tumble

02:23:37.818 --> 02:23:41.231
J or I'd never love at all j
