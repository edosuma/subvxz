WEBVTT

00:09.250 --> 00:11.333
Hey, look at this, Kyle.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.083
Mom.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.542
Oh, my God.
Put it back.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.917
But it's Tommy Bonzai.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.542
I don't want to wear
Tommy Bonzai on my shirt.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.250
Why not? I thought you loved
the Bonzai Brigade.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.000
'Cause I gotta look cool.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.250
'Kyle's gotta look cool.'

00:28.333 --> 00:29.834
Tell her why.

00:29.917 --> 00:31.250
Tell her why.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.917
Shelby's gonna be in
my class this year.

00:37.375 --> 00:38.834
Shelby Bryman?

00:38.917 --> 00:42.375
And everyone knows Miss Drake
seats alphabetical, so..

00:42.458 --> 00:44.542
She'll sit next to me.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.083
Got it.

00:46.166 --> 00:47.291
Strikin' Tommy.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.792
Look, how do these
grab you for cool? Hmm?

00:50.875 --> 00:52.375
Yeah.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.250
Oh, yeah.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.333
25 bucks a pop.

00:56.417 --> 00:59.125
Come on, it's just
a couple of shirts.

00:59.208 --> 01:00.583
One shirt?

01:02.542 --> 01:04.417
Maybe one.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.500
Let's hit the dressing room.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.166
I can go by myself.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.709
I don't know.

01:09.792 --> 01:11.834
I'm not a baby, Mom.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.667
He'll be
fine,
I promise.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.458
Kyle?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.875
You got to pretend to try
these on for mom.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.750
Kyle.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.625
Kyle?

01:51.667 --> 01:53.667
Kyle!

01:56.542 --> 01:58.333
Kyle!

02:35.959 --> 02:37.500
Father.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.959
(male #1)
'John.'

02:40.792 --> 02:42.083
Thanks for dropping by.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.125
Oh, thanks nothing.
You owe me a dime.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.709
Aah.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.583
Our Lord rested on Sunday.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.542
Apparently, so does
the Sixers defense.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.291
Yeah..

02:56.500 --> 02:58.000
Janie was here
yesterday.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.542
Yeah.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.417
Final arrangements
for the baptism.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.625
Yeah.

03:02.709 --> 03:04.750
Her boy is growing
like a weed.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.208
Something going
on with her?

03:07.291 --> 03:08.834
Not that I know of.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.667
Have you talked lately?

03:12.041 --> 03:14.959
Well, it's been a few weeks.
I'm swamped at work.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.417
Well, work is why I called you.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.583
In 1998, I took
confession
from a neighborhood kid

03:22.667 --> 03:24.750
Bernie Gantz.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.417
He was caught up
in a kidnapping.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.250
- Kidnapping of who?
- A little boy. Kyle Bream.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.625
They found him dead
in Salem Harbor.

03:34.709 --> 03:35.625
Hmm.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.417
Has Gantz confessed
to the murder?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.834
No, said he was
just
paid to watch him.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.875
Where do I find him?

03:42.959 --> 03:44.500
All Saints ground.

03:44.583 --> 03:47.667
He got himself killed last
week, robbing a jewelry store.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.625
Bernie never did
much with his life.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.291
Maybe some good can
come from his death.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.542
I'll pull the job,
take another look.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.000
And give Janie a call.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.959
Yeah. I will.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.959
Kyle Bream, nine
years old
disappeared

04:45.041 --> 04:47.250
from a department
store in
Torresdale.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.000
'A day later, the parents
get a ransom call.''

04:49.083 --> 04:50.625
FBI come in?

04:50.709 --> 04:53.458
They set up a money drop,
put undercovers at the
scene.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.125
Hey.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.709
Hey.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.000
Dad puts the cash in a
prearranged Dumpster.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.750
Ten minutes later, a guy
comes digging the Feds move in.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.041
He's the wrong guy
just a vagrant.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.458
Kidnapper never showed.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.250
Figured he made
the Feds, got spooked.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.291
And the Breams never
saw Kyle again.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.083
Body was found a month
later, drowned.

05:16.166 --> 05:19.083
So the heat's on, kidnapper
cuts
his losses and kills the kid.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.250
Did they ever get close
on who snatched him?

05:21.333 --> 05:22.959
No phone trace.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.542
Nothing on store cameras.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.458
(Will)
Maybe the late
Bernie Gantz gets us closer.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.959
Oh, Gantz is the guy
who told your brother

05:30.041 --> 05:31.250
he was paid to watch Kyle?

05:31.333 --> 05:32.875
Mmm. What did you find on him?

05:32.959 --> 05:36.792
He was small time theft,
credit
card fraud, a forgery charge.

05:36.875 --> 05:39.417
Tried to fake
a Power Ball ticket.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.125
It's a real brain trust, huh?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.417
His older brother Manny.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.083
'Same shed, different tool.'

05:44.166 --> 05:47.291
A lot of the same
arrests as Bernie.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.875
Could be a team?

05:58.834 --> 05:59.917
Hey, Manny.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.458
Mind if we step
into your office?

06:01.542 --> 06:04.000
Of..
Office? I just eat here.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.792
<i>kubide</i>
west of the Nile.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.041
(John)
'We want to talk to you
about Kyle Bream.'

06:08.125 --> 06:09.625
- Who?
- Nine year old.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.792
Got abducted, and
murdered in '98.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.125
Yeah, your brother
Bernie was in on it.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.667
Bernie had his own life.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.667
Well, you got mirror-image
rap sheets that say different.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.792
You were partners.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.333
We can't get Bernie
on murder

06:20.417 --> 06:22.792
him being dead and all,
but we can still get you.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.333
Whoa! Back the truck up.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.000
We had nothing to do
with that kid dying.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.792
So just the kidnapping then?

06:28.875 --> 06:30.667
You can talk to us
or the Feds

06:30.750 --> 06:32.834
they'd be real interested in
your little operation here.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.583
Operation?

06:34.667 --> 06:36.125
It's just some fake
ID's for kids.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.959
Selling forged papers out
of a Middle Eastern
restaurant.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.333
Two words, Manny.
Patriot Act.

06:41.417 --> 06:44.166
They could put you in a
hole no lawyer, no trial..

06:44.250 --> 06:46.291
<i>kubide.</i>

06:51.125 --> 06:52.959
This guy hired us
to watch the kid.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.458
We were
baby-sitters
that's it.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.709
What guy?
Give us a name.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.792
No names,
that's how he wanted
it.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.500
- 'Anonymous-like.'
- How'd it work?

06:59.583 --> 07:03.000
One crew to snatch
the kid, one...to watch..

07:03.083 --> 07:06.166
No names, no faces..

07:06.250 --> 07:08.083
I only saw the guy once.

07:11.375 --> 07:14.291
- Gin.
- Oh, you rat bastard!

07:14.375 --> 07:16.583
'Hey, kid, you
want to play?'

07:16.667 --> 07:19.083
You can't do any worse
than this mook.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.542
My dad's coming to get me.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.250
'Sure he is.'

07:26.333 --> 07:28.875
I'm gonna miss the
first day of school.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.291
That's the breaks, kid.

07:36.542 --> 07:39.083
I'm supposed to sit
next to Shelby.

07:43.792 --> 07:44.750
That's him.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.542
Dad?

07:46.625 --> 07:48.959
- Take him in the other room.
- Come on.

07:54.792 --> 07:57.250
- Kyle's in the other room?
- Yeah, you're clear.

08:01.291 --> 08:03.166
- He okay?
- Keeps asking about his dad.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.583
Worried school
started without him.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.709
This'll all be
over soon enough.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.083
I gave the parents the terms.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.041
They'll get the kid
as soon as they pay
up.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.583
What if they can't pay up?

08:10.667 --> 08:13.750
They've got 100 large
in bearer bonds in their
safe.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.375
They'll pay.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.875
Bonds in the safe.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.375
- How'd he know about that?
- Beats me.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.333
All I know is that when
the drop went south

08:24.417 --> 08:26.834
he got cold feet
he paid us off.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.667
And you left
Kyle with him?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.333
It was business.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.542
Yeah.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.500
So is this.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.792
We packed up Kyle's
room last year.

08:51.500 --> 08:57.375
It's hard to...know what
to keep, what to let go of.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.375
Sure.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.250
Or what to do with the room.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.625
Maybe one day it'll
be a nursery again.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.875
We might have a lead.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.834
Someone involved
in the kidnapping.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.083
Did you own some bearer bonds,
Mr. Bream, back in '98?

09:13.166 --> 09:14.208
Yeah.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.458
We cashed them in
for the ransom.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.166
The FBI thought
our best chance

09:18.250 --> 09:20.834
was to go
along
with their
sting.

09:20.917 --> 09:22.291
I didn't want to.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.458
Did they go
against
your wishes?

09:24.542 --> 09:28.625
Ken thought we should take
their advice ...so we did.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.291
(Ken)
'They explained
the percentages.'

09:31.375 --> 09:32.750
This was our best shot.

09:32.834 --> 09:36.125
Unfortunately, those
percentages
didn't apply to us.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.875
- That's not Kyle.
- They said to stay back.

09:41.959 --> 09:44.500
It's not him they
can't
put Kyle in that
bag.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.625
He's gone, baby.
Oh, God, he's gone.

09:46.709 --> 09:48.959
- You said to work with them.
- I thought--

09:49.041 --> 09:50.875
You said that's how
we'd get him back.

09:50.959 --> 09:53.375
You said he could go by
himself to the dressing
rooms.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.166
- Baby..
- You promised he'd be fine.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.333
Anyway.

10:06.417 --> 10:10.000
We believe whoever
knew about the bonds

10:10.083 --> 10:12.333
had something to do
with the kidnapping.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.417
No one knew about them.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.083
(Nick)
'You sure about that?'

10:15.166 --> 10:17.250
Yeah, I never
told a soul.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.000
What?

10:21.083 --> 10:23.166
My sister.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.041
I told her...
in case
something

10:26.125 --> 10:28.750
'ever happened to us
I wanted them to know.'

10:28.834 --> 10:30.041
Them?

10:30.125 --> 10:31.834
She and her husband.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.250
You told Ed?

10:34.333 --> 10:36.000
Who's Ed?

10:41.250 --> 10:42.750
(Scotty)
'Things didn't turn
out so good between'

10:42.834 --> 10:45.375
you, and Tina
Bream's
sister, huh, Ed?

10:45.458 --> 10:47.291
Didn't even make it to
his second anniversary.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.792
I had a problem.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.417
I guess you
guys
know that.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.125
Locked up three times
for drugs, twice for theft.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.542
I was stealing
to support my habit.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.709
Slippery slope.

10:56.792 --> 10:59.208
Petty theft...kidnapping..

10:59.291 --> 11:00.458
- Murder.
- No.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.542
Manny Gantz picked you
out of a photo spread.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.375
You snatched Kyle
killed your own nephew.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.750
- I didn't kill no one.
- You needed money.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.583
The in-laws had it
you knew how to get it.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.500
Yeah, but when things got
hinky with the ransom

11:10.583 --> 11:12.458
you got nervous, and
now Kyle's a liability.

11:12.542 --> 11:13.709
- I'm out of here.
- Hey, Eddie.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.417
You ain't listening?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.417
We got a witness.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.667
Okay.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.458
I'm a scumbag.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.250
I took Kyle, but..

11:31.583 --> 11:33.750
...when I saw
the Feds at the drop

11:33.834 --> 11:36.458
I got scared, so..

11:36.542 --> 11:38.834
...I made other arrangements.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.917
So you're Kyle.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.417
You like comics, Kyle?

11:50.542 --> 11:53.291
Some.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.500
They made this one
into a movie, right?

11:58.542 --> 12:00.333
It was a video game first.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.959
Right. You like
video games?

12:04.375 --> 12:08.750
My mom says...
Sega makes your head
soft.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.792
Hey, I got a Sega.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.083
My head's okay.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.625
You can come play games
at my house if you want.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.041
I want my mom and dad.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.166
Mm.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.959
I'm told they went on a trip.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.834
Without me?

12:28.917 --> 12:30.542
I don't know why.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.417
Was it 'cause..

12:37.500 --> 12:40.625
...m-my shirt costs $25 a pop?

12:42.583 --> 12:44.667
Wow.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.333
You know, that is a lot
of money for a shirt.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.750
Hey.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.709
Shh.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.667
No worries.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.208
See...you and me..

13:01.291 --> 13:03.875
...we could take
a trip of our own.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.291
'An adventure.'

13:08.083 --> 13:10.458
You can have your
own secret identity.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.000
Like Peter
Parker
in Spider-Man?

13:15.083 --> 13:16.417
Exactly.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.709
Parker.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.959
'I like that name.'

13:30.000 --> 13:32.500
Me and this guy made a deal.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.083
What kind of deal
are we talking about?

13:38.500 --> 13:41.291
What'd you do with Kyle?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.333
I sold him.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.625
Hey, babe. How are you?

14:03.834 --> 14:06.417
I thought you'd
bring the baby.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.041
He's with Mom.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.417
She coming Friday?

14:14.166 --> 14:15.709
Of course.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.125
I saw your uncle yesterday,
and uh..

14:20.208 --> 14:22.333
...he thought
you seemed upset.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.709
No.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.166
Janie?

14:29.792 --> 14:31.208
What?

14:34.083 --> 14:36.500
I saw Brad Witham
last week.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.417
I was having
dinner at
Olson's.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.250
He was behind the bar.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.792
Are you sure it was him?

14:49.875 --> 14:51.417
I know that smile.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.458
Right.

14:54.542 --> 14:57.458
Remember how you wanted
to press charges?

14:57.542 --> 15:00.125
- Yeah.
- Or at least go find him,
and..

15:00.208 --> 15:02.291
You and Mom stopped me.

15:06.041 --> 15:08.458
I wish you
hadn't
listened to us.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.917
Oh, Janie.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.583
Why was I worried about
what
people would think of me?

15:13.667 --> 15:16.083
Who cares about that now?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.542
You were so sure
of what you wanted.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.333
- You begged me--
- I know.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.417
You wanted to just forget it.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.667
Well.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.500
I was 18.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.291
I was wrong.

15:35.959 --> 15:39.542
So, what do we know about
this
guy who bought Kyle Bream?

15:39.625 --> 15:42.000
- Name's Rudy Tanner.
- Was, anyway.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.667
- Suspect's a cold job, too.
- For real? How'd it go?

15:44.750 --> 15:47.667
The guy was shot a few months
after Kyle turned up dead.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.875
School administrator, 45

15:49.959 --> 15:52.500
lived in Morrell Park.
Nice neighborhood.

15:52.583 --> 15:55.792
Well, someone took him out
in his nice tomato garden.

15:55.875 --> 15:59.083
(Lilly)
'The assigned took evidence
from the home computer.'

15:59.166 --> 16:01.166
Turns out Tanner was
running a website.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.291
"Boys-in-bloom.com."

16:05.375 --> 16:06.709
- Kiddie porn--
- Oh, man.

16:06.792 --> 16:09.375
- Kyle was an investment.
- Um, so why kill him?

16:09.458 --> 16:10.500
Let's get with
the Feds, see if they

16:10.583 --> 16:12.041
red-flagged
visitors to the site.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.458
This guy got family?

16:13.542 --> 16:14.792
Uh..

16:14.875 --> 16:16.166
...it looks like
he had a wife.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.166
Didn't she get the prize.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.166
This boy may have
stayed with you

16:24.250 --> 16:26.291
and your husband in
the fall of '98.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.583
Rudy and I were
separated by then.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.458
Was that because
of his website?

16:30.542 --> 16:33.125
I found out about that after
he died, like everyone else.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.709
Never suspected?

16:34.792 --> 16:38.125
I had a night job, a weekend
job, plus this during the
week.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.333
I didn't have time
to monitor him.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.375
- So you divorced him.
- He left me.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.333
Ditched me to raise
Archie on my own.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.166
- Archie's your son?
- Yeah.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.417
Did he ever spend time with
his dad after you two split?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.917
He'd stay with him
on the weekends when I worked.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.166
You weren't
worried about
that?

16:53.250 --> 16:55.542
Rudy would never..

16:55.625 --> 16:58.291
Not his own son.

16:58.375 --> 16:59.750
You ever see this kid?

17:01.834 --> 17:04.583
- But his hair was
different.
- How so?

17:04.667 --> 17:07.667
It was blond, like
Archie's I remember

17:07.750 --> 17:09.208
thinking they could've
been brothers.

17:09.291 --> 17:12.208
- Where was this?
- At Rudy's house,

17:12.291 --> 17:15.208
One Sunday when I went
to pick up Archie.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.208
Archie!

17:19.000 --> 17:21.417
Got to go! Right now!

17:21.500 --> 17:23.291
'Archie!'

17:23.375 --> 17:26.291
Mom? In here.
Y-You're early.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.625
And I want to get
to the store
before

17:27.709 --> 17:28.959
it closes, so
get your
stuff.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.709
But Dad wanted me
to make milkshakes.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.000
If I don't shop tonight,
I can't go again

17:32.083 --> 17:34.625
until Wednesday,
so let's move it.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.166
Put your coat
on.
I'll get your
stuff.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.542
No, Mom, y-you
can't go in there.

17:44.083 --> 17:47.166
That's Parker,
some family friend.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.709
Why is he in
your bedroom?

17:48.792 --> 17:51.834
His parents are out of town,
so dad gave him my room.

17:51.917 --> 17:54.166
(Kyle)
'I don't like
Samurai Planet.'

17:55.417 --> 17:58.000
He got the wrong ones.
I like Bonzai Brigade.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.625
I've got all 24 issues at home.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.000
What are you doing
here, Sandra?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.542
I-I got off early.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.458
- Let's go, Archie.
- Can't I just stay?

18:07.542 --> 18:09.333
I mean, maybe Dad
could bring me home.

18:09.417 --> 18:11.875
Next time, kiddo.
Get your coat.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.875
Nap time in ten
minutes, star.

18:17.041 --> 18:18.917
His parents are
colleagues of
mine.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.166
They're both sick.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.917
It's a real tragedy.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.709
Archie said they
went out of town.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.291
It's a cover story.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.166
He looks like Archie
when he was--

18:30.250 --> 18:31.709
Nine.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.417
Yes, he does.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.000
Such a wonderful age.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.875
I didn't know
anything was wrong.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.083
I didn't.

18:53.792 --> 18:56.709
Your mom saw this kid
at your dad's place.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.291
Yeah, that's, um..

19:02.375 --> 19:06.417
That's, what's his
name?
Uh...Parker.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.875
Parker?

19:07.959 --> 19:09.709
Yeah, my-my dad took
him in for a while.

19:09.792 --> 19:12.375
He was having some
problems at home.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.208
That's what your
pop said, huh?

19:14.291 --> 19:16.250
Yeah, he was
like
that generous.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.250
The kid's real name
was Kyle Bream.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.125
He got murdered after
your dad took him in.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.250
'Murdered?'

19:24.333 --> 19:26.500
You're not saying my dad
had
anything to do with that?

19:26.583 --> 19:29.083
Your dad bought Kyle
from the man who kidnapped him.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.750
- No.
- Archie.

19:31.834 --> 19:34.291
- He was a child pornographer.
- Oh, not that crap again.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.834
There's evidence
his website.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.375
My dad gave this
kid a home after

19:38.458 --> 19:40.333
his own parents
bailed on him.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.917
Can we throw the football, Dad?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.291
'Practice my spiral?'

19:47.375 --> 19:49.417
Sure. Later.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.625
What's wrong, Parker?

20:02.709 --> 20:04.208
Nothing.

20:12.625 --> 20:13.959
Tell me.

20:16.041 --> 20:19.208
I didn't really care
if I had cool shirts.

20:19.291 --> 20:22.417
I know, but people get
overwhelmed sometimes.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.959
That's what happened
to my mom and dad?

20:27.041 --> 20:28.875
A little boy can
be very
expensive.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.709
That's why they
didn't want me?

20:31.792 --> 20:34.250
Yeah.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.125
But Uncle Rudy does.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.917
And he won't leave you.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.959
Can we practice now?

20:41.041 --> 20:42.750
Whatever Parker wants.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.333
Parker isn't
good
at football.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.375
My dad just tried to help him.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.250
Kyle had brown hair.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.333
So?

21:00.417 --> 21:03.166
Your dad changed it
to look like yours.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.166
Your mom said you could
have been brothers.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.333
And your meaning is what?

21:10.166 --> 21:12.709
My father was a good man.

21:30.625 --> 21:35.125
- 'Hey, boss.'
- What's the latest?

21:35.208 --> 21:38.792
Well, this Rudy Tanner did
a Stockholm Syndrome on Kyle.

21:38.875 --> 21:41.959
Had him believing his
parents ran out on him.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.709
That explains how
he kept him there.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.667
Also had his son Archie thinking
he was the world's greatest dad.

21:47.750 --> 21:51.250
Hmm, a kid's got
to believe in someone.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.500
(Will)
'Got the FBI file on
Tanner's website.'

21:54.583 --> 21:56.375
There's pictures.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.375
Of Kyle?

21:57.458 --> 21:58.917
Among others.

22:01.917 --> 22:03.583
That might not be
the worst of it.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.250
Federal watch list for
paying
members to the site.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.208
Check the B's.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.792
Ken Bream?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.250
Kyle's dad had himself
a membership.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.041
You like boys, Ken?

22:27.125 --> 22:28.500
What are you talking about?

22:28.583 --> 22:31.417
Your membership
to boys-in-bloom.com.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.875
Kyle showed up
on that site...as a model.

22:34.959 --> 22:36.709
Yeah, that's some
kind of coincidence.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.583
It's not what you think.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.333
(Nick)
'Then what is it?'

22:41.709 --> 22:43.083
(Tina)
'My husband didn't have
anything'

22:43.166 --> 22:44.959
'to do with what
happened to Kyle.'

22:45.041 --> 22:48.083
You don't really sound
convinced of that.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.417
I just shouldn't
have believed him.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.625
About what?

22:51.709 --> 22:54.333
That Kyle would
be okay by himself

22:54.417 --> 22:56.458
at the store.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.917
We're not talking about
the dressing room, Tina.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.375
Then what?

23:00.458 --> 23:02.583
(Will)
'Mrs. Bream, your
husband was accessing'

23:02.667 --> 23:05.000
child pornography
on the Internet.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.917
I know.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.375
(Nick)
'Rudy Tanner.'

23:11.458 --> 23:13.625
- You know him?
- No.

23:13.709 --> 23:16.375
See, the innocent answer would
have been "Rudy" who?

23:16.458 --> 23:18.291
- Or just "Who"?
- I would have taken either.

23:18.375 --> 23:20.959
- I didn't know him.
- 'Didn't ?'

23:21.041 --> 23:23.750
Hey, pervert.
We're talking to you.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.041
- What'd you call me?
- 'I know what you are.'

23:26.125 --> 23:27.792
I make a study out
of people like you.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.625
You don't know anything.

23:31.625 --> 23:33.250
Then tell us.

23:34.959 --> 23:37.333
It was Rudy Tanner's site.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.542
Pictures of little boys?

23:39.625 --> 23:41.166
Including Kyle.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.375
I'm the one who
told Ken about it.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.125
How did you know?

23:49.667 --> 23:53.834
We got...crank calls
after Kyle died.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.709
Letters.

23:56.792 --> 23:58.375
You don't know how cruel.

23:59.625 --> 24:02.834
At first, I thought
she was one of them.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.083
M-Mrs. Bream?

24:10.959 --> 24:12.250
I, uh..

24:12.333 --> 24:13.959
I saw your boy.

24:15.291 --> 24:16.208
What?

24:16.291 --> 24:19.333
Your son, Kyle I..

24:19.417 --> 24:21.709
...I saw him.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.041
My son is dead.

24:23.125 --> 24:27.125
Last fall, in a
house
on Highland
Street.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.375
Don't do this.

24:28.458 --> 24:29.542
The man who lives there

24:29.625 --> 24:33.959
Rudy Tanner,
he hurt my boy
too.

24:35.834 --> 24:38.041
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.709
He took pictures of your boy.

24:40.792 --> 24:44.041
- There's a website--
- Get away from me.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.583
'He likes Bonzai Brigade.'

24:52.625 --> 24:54.875
But not Samurai Planet.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.667
'He said he had all the
good comics at home.'

24:59.750 --> 25:01.792
'24 issues.'

25:03.625 --> 25:06.417
Rudy lied to me.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.000
But I believed him.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.166
I'm..

25:13.250 --> 25:15.583
I'm so sorry.

25:16.667 --> 25:17.917
I'm sorry.

25:19.458 --> 25:24.000
She told me, and I told Ken.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.583
Why not go to the police?

25:25.667 --> 25:27.792
I didn't have a lot of
faith
in the authorities

25:27.875 --> 25:29.333
at that point.

25:32.291 --> 25:33.834
Right.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.250
It was time
to make things right.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.709
I went to that site

25:39.792 --> 25:43.375
that woman told Tina about.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.375
I bought a password.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.542
And there was Kyle...in..

25:51.750 --> 25:53.500
We know.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.875
She blamed me

25:58.959 --> 26:01.458
'for-for losing him'

26:01.542 --> 26:03.750
and for the FBI.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.583
I had to make it up to her.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.375
By doing what?

26:32.083 --> 26:33.500
Turn around.

26:37.667 --> 26:38.875
Who are you?

26:38.959 --> 26:41.166
I was Kyle Bream's dad.

26:41.250 --> 26:44.333
Oh! The boy in the harbor.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.333
I read about him.
I'm so sorry.

26:47.417 --> 26:50.125
- You got nerve.
- No, Mr. Bream.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.583
'You know that feeling
when you wake up'

26:51.667 --> 26:56.667
from a nightmare and you
realize
it was just a dream?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.500
How good that feels?

26:58.583 --> 27:00.166
That relief?

27:02.542 --> 27:04.375
When I wake up.

27:04.458 --> 27:07.375
I realize it was all real.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.583
- I didn't kill him.
- I saw the pictures.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.917
That's all it was.
It was just pictures.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.417
And that was enough.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.917
You deserve worse than this.

27:20.291 --> 27:22.125
But it'll have to do.

27:27.375 --> 27:28.959
Then let me tell
you the truth.

27:29.041 --> 27:31.041
Dad.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.208
He was the best piece of..

27:53.917 --> 27:56.083
I never thought I'd
get away with it.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.959
Then, months went by,
then years.

28:04.625 --> 28:07.125
You know we're going
to have to charge you.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.500
It was wrong, I know, but..

28:16.208 --> 28:18.208
...I'm not sorry.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.625
It didn't help, though.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.959
He's still gone.

28:33.709 --> 28:35.959
(Lilly)
'You told Tina Bream what
was going on in that house'

28:36.041 --> 28:37.375
'but you didn't tell us.'

28:37.458 --> 28:38.750
I've got caravan
in ten minutes.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.792
You knew what was
happening with
Kyle.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.125
Plus a client is
waiting for me to call.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.125
Hey, Sandra,
stand still.

28:47.583 --> 28:50.083
He was her son.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.542
She deserved to know.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.917
Telling her got
your
husband killed.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.250
Is that kind of
what you intended?

28:55.333 --> 28:57.959
I saw that boy's
picture in the paper

28:58.041 --> 28:59.125
and I knew what
Rudy had done.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.125
I thought he should pay.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.250
For what he did to Kyle?

29:05.250 --> 29:06.333
Or to Archie?

29:06.417 --> 29:08.500
He never touched Archie.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.500
You told Mrs.
Bream
Rudy lied to you.

29:12.583 --> 29:15.667
You weren't just talking about
that day with Kyle, were you?

29:15.750 --> 29:16.959
That's why all
the night jobs.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.500
The weekend jobs.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.583
'Never going home.'

29:20.667 --> 29:22.542
'Would have meant having
to deal with it.'

29:22.625 --> 29:26.375
I never thought a man like Rudy
would look at someone like me.

29:26.458 --> 29:28.583
So you let him
hurt
your own boy?

29:30.750 --> 29:32.458
I pretended I didn't see.

29:33.750 --> 29:36.166
It was easier that way.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.834
To believe..

29:38.917 --> 29:41.500
What?

29:41.583 --> 29:43.291
That I was his star.

29:45.041 --> 29:48.000
He always called me that, he..

29:48.083 --> 29:51.959
Before Archie was born, "Star".

30:02.458 --> 30:04.542
(Scotty)
'Your mom's sorry, Archie'

30:04.625 --> 30:06.417
for what your dad did.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.375
For not stopping him.

30:09.458 --> 30:12.041
I don't know what
she means by that.

30:12.125 --> 30:14.875
Why are you protecting him?
He hurt you.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.417
He hurt Kyle too, didn't he?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.667
He was there for me.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.917
She wasn't.
She was never around.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.667
She worked three jobs
to support you.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.000
To avoid me, you mean.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.375
Look, whatever your
mom's feelings were

30:25.458 --> 30:27.125
your dad did worse.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.709
No.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.667
No, he..

30:33.959 --> 30:35.041
...he loved me.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.333
That ain't love, Archie.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.375
He couldn't have hurt Parker

30:43.458 --> 30:45.542
because Parker went away.

30:52.041 --> 30:53.959
You make a mean
milkshake, son.

30:54.041 --> 30:55.542
'Doesn't he, Parker?'

30:55.625 --> 30:56.959
'Yeah.'

31:00.291 --> 31:01.917
I got to go
to the
bathroom.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.125
Come here.

31:06.041 --> 31:08.500
Hey, keep the door open.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.125
Why do you watch
him like that?

31:15.208 --> 31:16.709
Like what?

31:18.583 --> 31:20.458
He's never going away, is he?

31:23.291 --> 31:25.542
I'm going online.
Keep off the phone.

31:27.792 --> 31:29.375
- Dad?
- What, Archie?

31:29.458 --> 31:31.959
Why...why don't you
like me anymore?

31:36.875 --> 31:39.417
Get your stuff before
mom blows a gasket.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.333
(Rudy)
'A deal's a deal.
He's bought and paid for.'

31:48.417 --> 31:49.625
(Eddie)
'I'll get your money back.'

31:49.709 --> 31:51.125
(Rudy)
'I don't want the money.'

31:51.208 --> 31:53.250
- I have what I want.
- Please..

31:53.333 --> 31:55.625
(Eddie)
'I made a mistake.'

31:55.709 --> 31:57.709
Uncle Ed?

32:02.417 --> 32:05.417
You saying Kyle's uncle
came to the house?

32:05.500 --> 32:08.667
I told you my dad
was innocent.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.959
What happened when Ed came?

32:13.667 --> 32:15.500
He took Kyle away.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.166
That was the last time
that I ever saw him.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.583
I told you, I gave Kyle
to that Tanner guy.

32:25.667 --> 32:26.834
Sold him.

32:26.917 --> 32:28.250
And that was the
last
you saw of him?

32:28.333 --> 32:29.834
- Right.
- That's weird.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.667
I got a witness puts you at
Tanner's place after the
fact.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.083
- What witness?
- His son.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.375
(Will)
'He said you came
back for Kyle.'

32:36.458 --> 32:37.500
(Scotty)
'Did a repo.'

32:37.583 --> 32:39.166
Someone offer you
a better price?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.792
Maybe you thought it was safer
for you if Kyle was dead.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.542
- No tracks.
- Come on, no.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.291
- No, you didn't go back
there?
- Yeah, okay.

32:45.375 --> 32:48.417
- I went, but that's not--
- He was your nephew, Eddie!

32:48.500 --> 32:50.166
It's blood.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.000
I smoked up all the money.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.375
Six weeks straight
I'm flying.

32:58.458 --> 33:00.583
Then I come down

33:00.667 --> 33:02.709
seen what I done.

33:02.792 --> 33:05.000
I went back there
to make things right.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.709
(Kyle)
'Uncle Ed?'

33:07.792 --> 33:09.291
Uncle Ed, what
are you doing here?

33:09.375 --> 33:10.542
I came to take
you home.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.166
This is his home.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.000
- Right, Parker?
- Parker?

33:14.083 --> 33:17.375
Archie, take him
to his room.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.542
Kyle, don't you
want to go home?

33:19.625 --> 33:21.625
He is home!

33:21.709 --> 33:23.250
'It's okay, Uncle Ed.'

33:23.333 --> 33:25.583
I'm too expensive.

33:29.417 --> 33:30.583
What'd you do to him?

33:30.667 --> 33:32.458
I loved him.

33:32.542 --> 33:35.750
Which is more than
you can say, Uncle
Ed.

33:35.834 --> 33:38.125
So, the parents, they don't
know about the whole child

33:38.208 --> 33:40.041
peddling side of the family.

33:40.125 --> 33:41.375
Aren't you the black sheep?

33:41.458 --> 33:43.083
You can't just keep
him here like this.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.417
'That's why we're
gonna go away.'

33:44.500 --> 33:47.208
- Where?
- Canada maybe, or Europe.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.583
Just him and me,
no distractions.

33:48.667 --> 33:49.792
(Eddie)
'You're crazy.'

33:49.875 --> 33:51.667
'Kyle, get out here!'

33:51.750 --> 33:54.583
Kidnapping, 25 to life.

33:54.667 --> 33:57.709
That means stone-cold
sober in a six by nine
cell.

33:57.792 --> 34:00.875
Think about it.

34:00.959 --> 34:03.750
Oh, you're out of money.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.542
'Don't be ashamed.'

34:05.625 --> 34:07.667
We all have our needs.

34:07.750 --> 34:10.125
Will a thousand do it?

34:10.208 --> 34:11.291
Two?

34:11.375 --> 34:12.375
Get away from me.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.709
Five?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.333
We have a winning number.

34:23.917 --> 34:26.625
God, help me.

34:26.709 --> 34:28.166
I left him.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.125
I hadn't had
a hit in
days.

34:31.208 --> 34:32.417
You don't know
what it's like.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.250
No, I guess I'm missing out.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.000
Archie said you took him.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.166
I'd give anything
if that were true.

34:50.834 --> 34:52.500
How's the drink?

34:52.583 --> 34:53.917
Good.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.959
- What are you having?
- Scotch, neat.

35:03.041 --> 35:05.500
- McCallan? Oban?
- Well.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.792
Pretty girl. Maybe
you'll get lucky,
huh?

35:10.875 --> 35:12.041
You never know.

35:13.417 --> 35:14.709
Get a few drinks in her,
take her home

35:14.792 --> 35:16.166
she's good to go, right?

35:16.250 --> 35:17.166
Ah.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.125
Even if she says otherwise.

35:21.417 --> 35:22.917
Do I know you?

35:25.250 --> 35:27.667
You don't remember.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.625
Maybe the name, Stillman.

35:33.417 --> 35:36.041
- Janie's dad.
- Hmm.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.792
It's been like 20 years.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.834
Eighteen.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.792
Look, I don't know
what she told--

35:41.875 --> 35:44.333
She lives in this
neighborhood now.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.041
This is her home.

35:48.417 --> 35:50.083
So, tonight..

35:50.166 --> 35:51.917
...you're
going
to quit this
job.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.625
You can't tell
me what to do.

35:57.667 --> 36:00.500
I can do a lot, Brian.

36:00.583 --> 36:03.875
18 years ago, my
daughter
kept me and you apart

36:03.959 --> 36:05.500
but times change.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.125
You get me?

36:22.750 --> 36:25.959
You and Kyle's uncle tell
different stories, Archie.

36:28.208 --> 36:31.000
You're going to believe
a meth-head kidnapper or me?

36:31.083 --> 36:33.375
Well, you agree on one thing.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.709
Ed came back for Kyle,
but he didn't leave with him.

36:36.792 --> 36:39.250
Your dad persuaded
him otherwise.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.125
My dad wouldn't kill Parker.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.208
Even after he got tired of him?

36:43.291 --> 36:45.625
Like he got tired of you?

36:45.709 --> 36:47.792
No.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.208
Not Parker.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.625
Why not?

36:53.250 --> 36:55.083
Because he was his "Star".

37:03.291 --> 37:05.250
Huh.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.458
'Non-filters.'

37:06.542 --> 37:08.375
Reminds me of home.

37:11.208 --> 37:15.333
Yeah, my mom had
a two-pack a day
habit.

37:15.417 --> 37:16.375
Good for her.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.125
'And a little vodka to..'

37:18.208 --> 37:20.125
...smooth it all out.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.041
Yeah, some nights
more than a little.

37:23.125 --> 37:28.500
Then it was my job to
clean
her up, put her to bed.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.375
That sounds great.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.333
'It sucked.'

37:35.834 --> 37:37.959
I did it anyway.

37:38.041 --> 37:40.166
Hmm. Know why?

37:41.542 --> 37:44.333
Because after I
tucked
her in some nights

37:44.417 --> 37:48.125
she'd reach out..

37:48.208 --> 37:50.250
...like this.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.500
And that made it
okay,
her doing that..

37:57.083 --> 37:59.125
...loving me.

38:01.250 --> 38:03.417
I would have done
anything for that.

38:07.542 --> 38:10.792
Yeah?

38:10.875 --> 38:13.041
Yeah.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.709
'Like you did.'

38:15.792 --> 38:17.542
For years.

38:20.917 --> 38:22.333
For your dad.

38:22.417 --> 38:26.750
Yeah, but then
Kyle came along.

38:26.834 --> 38:28.208
Right?

38:28.291 --> 38:30.875
Took your bedroom, your stuff.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.667
(Lilly)
'Your dad found
someone new to love'

38:33.750 --> 38:35.959
'and he was going
to take him away'

38:36.041 --> 38:38.000
and leave you behind.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.333
Canada or Europe.

38:45.208 --> 38:46.834
You were only 13.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.041
You needed your dad.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.417
I believed him, you know?

38:53.500 --> 38:54.709
You believed?

38:54.792 --> 38:56.667
What he always told me.

38:58.125 --> 38:59.792
That I was his "Star."

39:02.083 --> 39:04.208
I couldn't let Parker
have my dad.

39:13.875 --> 39:15.500
[whispers]
Hey.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.000
Come on, get up.

39:17.083 --> 39:18.542
We're leaving.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.667
Wh-Where are we going?

39:21.750 --> 39:24.000
Tell me where you live.
I can take you home.

39:24.083 --> 39:25.417
I am home.

39:25.500 --> 39:29.041
No, this is my
home, not yours.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.375
Y-Your mom and dad
never went away.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
They didn't?

39:44.542 --> 39:46.542
'They've been looking for you.'

39:46.625 --> 39:49.125
'That's you.'

39:49.208 --> 39:50.291
Yeah.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.125
You ready to go home?

40:07.542 --> 40:09.000
Those lights,
that's
Torresdale.

40:09.083 --> 40:11.834
That's where
your house
is.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.375
This is as far as I go.

40:14.458 --> 40:16.959
The rest is up to you.

40:17.041 --> 40:19.375
I can't swim that far.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.250
Listen to me.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.834
Your mom and your dad

40:23.917 --> 40:25.625
they're there
waiting for
you.

40:26.959 --> 40:29.917
'Look, you can make it,
little guy, go on.'

40:30.000 --> 40:31.333
Can you come with me?

40:31.417 --> 40:33.166
No. This is my home.

40:34.542 --> 40:37.583
- He doesn't even like you.
- He does like me.

40:37.667 --> 40:39.208
He's my dad.

40:40.625 --> 40:43.000
Look, he's coming,
Kyle.
You gotta go.

40:44.792 --> 40:46.500
- Where is he?
- He's right behind us.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.000
You gotta go now.

41:02.208 --> 41:05.500
I can make it, right, Archie?

41:05.583 --> 41:07.208
Yeah.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.834
Keep going.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.959
You can make it, little guy.

44:44.125 --> 44:45.375
