(female narrator)
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.170 --> 00:04.467
Toby's fiancee kind of left this

00:04.500 --> 00:06.468
and I kinda, sort of
didn't give it back.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.161
I wouldn't want people to think
you stole somebody's phone.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.999
Somebody whose mother
is running against

00:10.110 --> 00:12.135
your mother.
That would be awkward.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.231
(Emily)
'I'm broke.
I'm donating my eggs.‘

00:14.340 --> 00:16.069
This isn't going to hurt a bit.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.072
You've been my rock.
Thank you.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.211
You're here to tell me
if you'd feel safe

00:22.320 --> 00:23.719
'should Charlotte DiLaurentis
leave the hospital.‘

00:23.820 --> 00:27.278
There's a line of girls
just waiting to take your place.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.221
- What do you wanna do?
- Can we just keep driving?

00:29.330 --> 00:32.026
Where did you go that night
after you left Aria?

00:32.130 --> 00:33.449
(Aria)
I've gotta get in there
and get that golf club

00:33.560 --> 00:35.198
before Sara tries
to frame my dad.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.221
(Spencer)
I haven't broken into a place

00:36.330 --> 00:37.319
since my dorm room.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.159
Aria, Sara's staying here

00:39.270 --> 00:40.692
because this was
Charlotte's old room

00:40.800 --> 00:43.268
when she was a patient
at Radley.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.073
Aria?

00:47.510 --> 00:49.671
I'm not used to having
an audience.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.169
Well, if you were experiencing
performance anxiety

00:52.280 --> 00:54.339
I was completely unaware of it.

00:54.450 --> 00:55.769
[chuckles]

00:55.880 --> 00:58.189
[sighs]
I thought places like this

00:58.290 --> 01:00.212
only existed in old movies.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.384
How'd you find it?

01:02.490 --> 01:05.459
Well, I searched for "Romantic"

01:05.560 --> 01:06.629
and, then "Tacky."

01:06.730 --> 01:08.550
[chuckles]

01:08.660 --> 01:10.423
You feeling better?

01:10.530 --> 01:12.395
Much better.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.731
Would you like some more
budget champagne?

01:15.840 --> 01:19.731
Not now. Let's give these cupids
something to remember.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.432
Oh.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.100
[pop music]

01:27.820 --> 01:30.448
[intense music]

01:38.230 --> 01:40.095
Look at this.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.131
Now I know where Charlotte
learned all those

01:46.240 --> 01:48.299
special little skills she had.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.279
[music continues]

02:03.650 --> 02:06.380
All this dust
and the doorknob's clean.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.524
(Aria)
'Spencer, stay close.‘

02:13.430 --> 02:15.557
'Why is this hallway so narrow?‘

02:15.660 --> 02:18.265
(Spencer)
'Cause it's not
a real hallway.

02:18.370 --> 02:19.496
It's been walled off.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.431
And this whole section
of the sanitarium

02:21.540 --> 02:23.599
sealed like something
in a Poe story.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.673
(Aria)
'So what, you-you think
they put the wall up'

02:26.780 --> 02:28.600
'when they turned
this place into a hotel?‘

02:29.880 --> 02:32.314
Well, the sanitarium
must have done it.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.341
Why?

02:33.450 --> 02:36.180
Well, to avoid having to explain
things like that

02:36.290 --> 02:38.542
littl_e motivational
experiment back there.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.687
Buildings can have secrets, too,
just like people.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.486
(Aria)
'So the hotel doesn't know
this exists?‘

02:44.590 --> 02:46.922
(Spencer)
I bet it's not on any
of the blueprints.

02:47.030 --> 02:49.225
- But Sara knew.
- Yeah.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.469
How do you suppose
that happened?

02:51.570 --> 02:53.561
Long, quiet chats
with Charlotte?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.194
Mm-hm.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.335
[sighs]

02:56.440 --> 02:59.159
[music continues]

03:01.440 --> 03:03.476
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.707
Spencer, the file cabinet.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.471
What about it?

03:09.020 --> 03:10.715
No dust.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.378
[clattering]

03:15.690 --> 03:18.329
[music continues]

03:21.260 --> 03:23.364
Are we still in Pennsylvania?

03:25.330 --> 03:27.639
Yeah, we're behind
the Radley someplace.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.334
Well, this explains
how Sara got in and out

03:30.440 --> 03:32.670
of her hotel room
to mess with us.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.499
Why go to so much trouble just
to sneak out of a hotel room?

03:35.610 --> 03:38.443
Maybe the sneaking's
only part of it.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.768
You're still really
good at this.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.348
I've had a lot of practice.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.441
* Got a secret
can you keep It *

03:45.550 --> 03:48.314
* Swear this one you'll save

03:48.420 --> 03:50.479
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:50.590 --> 03:53.252
* Taking this one to the grave

03:53.360 --> 03:55.590
* If I show you
then I know you *

03:55.700 --> 03:58.362
* Won't tell what I said

03:58.470 --> 04:00.563
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

04:00.670 --> 04:03.230
* If one of them is dead *

04:04.710 --> 04:06.268
[door opens]

04:08.010 --> 04:10.308
We found a hole in the hotel.

04:10.950 --> 04:11.905
What, you what?

04:12.010 --> 04:13.614
A hole, in the wall

04:13.720 --> 04:15.676
in Sara's closet,
in her room at The Radley.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.941
That's how she's been coming
and going all this time

04:18.050 --> 04:18.982
without walking
in front of those

04:19.090 --> 04:20.387
peslq cameras in the lobby.

04:20.490 --> 04:21.479
Hold on, hold on. Okay?

04:21.590 --> 04:22.784
I've been working with the data

04:22.890 --> 04:23.857
from Yvonne's cell phone.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.450
You found something?

04:25.560 --> 04:26.959
It was buried
deep in the server.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.826
I looked but...I didn't touch.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.261
What is it?

04:32.370 --> 04:34.565
It's the opposition research
file on your mom.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.708
These are my mom's
medical records.

04:37.810 --> 04:38.936
How do they have these?

04:39.980 --> 04:40.969
(Caleb)
'Look at the corners,
the folds.‘

04:42.240 --> 04:44.401
This isn't a scan, somebody
photographed this with a phone.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.774
_ This is not _research_.
This IS an mvasnon of privacy.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.814
Uh, this is exactly what's
wrong with American politics.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.808
- This is completely illegal--
- Spencer.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.820
Spencen

04:56.930 --> 04:59.398
[instrumental music]

04:59.500 --> 05:01.422
Did you know your mom was sick?

05:02.570 --> 05:03.764
Yeah.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.622
Um..

05:05.730 --> 05:07.334
She was.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.294
She was a long time ago.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.837
You better look.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.019
(Spencer)
"'Breast-conserving surgery.‘

05:21.120 --> 05:23.315
"Blood panels clear.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.309
Prognosis,
cautiously optimistic."

05:26.420 --> 05:28.411
This report is dated
eight months ago.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.526
My guess is that the Phillips
campaign is gonna leak this.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.688
They're gonna make it
seem like your mom's been

05:35.800 --> 05:37.665
keeping it a secret,
and that she's not healthy

05:37.770 --> 05:39.328
enough to serve.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.369
S-she never told me
anything about this.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.859
[music continues]

05:49.480 --> 05:50.549
I don't understand why

05:50.650 --> 05:52.777
the state police are getting
involved.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.643
There's a history here,
Dr. Rollins.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.889
Several jurisdictions
were involved.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.481
They said that,
Charlotte's death..

06:00.460 --> 06:02.781
...she struggled.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.983
Her wounds indicate
that she fought back.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.354
What exactly were those wounds?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.793
Anything that you have to say
to me you can say

06:10.900 --> 06:13.596
in front of Dr. Rollins.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.635
Before her body was thrown
from the bell tower

06:16.740 --> 06:19.038
she was struck along
the cervical spine

06:19.140 --> 06:21.108
with some kind of metal rod.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.940
Rectangular at the end
and hollow.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.142
How do you know the shape?

06:25.250 --> 06:26.672
It made an impression.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.645
A cut in the skin of her neck.

06:31.820 --> 06:32.582
Alison

06:32.690 --> 06:34.578
have you ever heard of
a restaurant

06:34.690 --> 06:36.658
called The Two Crows?

06:37.530 --> 06:39.122
I don't think so.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.095
What about it?

06:41.200 --> 06:43.964
The night Charlotte came home,
the night she was murdered

06:44.070 --> 06:46.129
someone used the landline
from The Two Crows

06:46.230 --> 06:48.391
to call this house.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.831
Nobody called here.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.407
The call went through.

06:51.510 --> 06:53.171
It lasted
more than three minutes.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.532
There weren't any calls.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.545
Were you here all night?

07:00.180 --> 07:02.648
No.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.945
Then it could have come
after you left.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.486
There's only one landline
and that rings down here.

07:08.590 --> 07:11.855
If you didn't answer it
and Dr. Rollins was gone

07:11.960 --> 07:13.825
then it must have been Charlotte
who picked up the phone

07:13.930 --> 07:16.148
and talked to someone
for three minutes.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.797
[dramatic music]

07:19.770 --> 07:21.431
- A hole in the closet?
- 'Yeah.‘

07:21.540 --> 07:22.905
(Spencer)
It led to all of this space
underneath.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.103
Whole parts of Radley
that had been sealed off.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.677
Parts from when
Charlotte was there.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.431
- Should we tel||\l Hanna's mom?
- o.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.472
If we tell Mrs. Marin,
she'll throw Sara out

07:31.580 --> 07:33.445
lock, stock and ladder.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.108
This way we know
about her escape hatch

07:35.220 --> 07:36.744
but she doesn't know
that we know.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.086
Maybe I really did see her
in the clinic.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.215
Have you checked in with them..

07:42.320 --> 07:43.856
...to make sure
that everything's okay?

07:43.960 --> 07:47.123
Yeah. I, I'm gonna go over
there as soon as they open.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.754
Guys, we need to tell Ali.

07:48.860 --> 07:51.169
- Tell Alison what?
- She was with me at the clinic.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.794
And she needs to know
about that.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.231
She needs to know about Sara.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.160
Okay, if we do tell Alison

07:56.270 --> 07:58.602
we have to be ready
for her to turn right around

07:58.710 --> 08:00.200
and go talk
to the police about it.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.005
Maybe that should happen.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.044
Maybe this is a new problem
and we're getting

08:04.150 --> 08:06.471
stuck in old thinking.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.878
{Secrets _
are getting toxrc again.'

08:08.980 --> 08:10.641
I don't know, just keep
on trying to get in touch

08:10.750 --> 08:13.014
with Hanna. I have to go
meet my mom at headquarters.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.781
Okay.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.798
Do you want me
to come with you?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.024
Are you absolutely sure?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.165
Yeah. I'll be alright.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.795
Or I will be as soon as I know.

08:28.900 --> 08:29.969
Okay.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.735
Hi.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.274
Liam.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.507
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:37.610 --> 08:38.872
Oh, my God.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.777
Wait. What are you doing here?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.108
- That was it for the welcome?
- No, no, no.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.688
- Is something wrong?
- No, no. All is good.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.951
I wouldn't come all
this way with bad news.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.517
- 'Hey.'
- Em.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.519
- This is Liam.
- Yeah. I know, we met.

08:52.630 --> 08:53.858
Sort of. On the computer.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.723
Nice to meet you in person.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.060
Um, I'll give you a call
as soon as I know.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.831
Okay.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.737
So, what's up?

09:02.840 --> 09:05.138
You and I need to talk
about Ezra Fitz.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.901
And the book.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.044
[indistinct chattering]

09:18.350 --> 09:20.079
- Morning, Spencer.
- Hey. Uh..

09:20.190 --> 09:22.010
I was hoping I could talk
to my mom for a second.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.327
Sure, I'll look the other way
if you can get her

09:24.430 --> 09:26.125
after she finishes
the phone call.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.197
Okay.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.324
Oh, and, uh,
tell Melissa I can't

09:28.430 --> 09:29.727
reimburse her
without a flight number.

09:29.830 --> 09:30.819
If she can't find
the boarding pass

09:30.930 --> 09:32.295
tell her to look
for the luggage tag.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.867
- Sure.
- Thanks.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.096
Yeah.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.668
You're welcome. Bye-bye.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.567
You were just gone
this morning.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.977
I know.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.241
Yeah, I looked at my phone
and added up the events

09:43.350 --> 09:47.047
and realized I was heading
towards a 27-hour day.

09:47.150 --> 09:48.742
- You were talking to Gill?
- Yeah.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.182
- Tell him not to worry.
- Worry about what?

09:51.290 --> 09:52.780
About the poll numbers
coming out today.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.687
He thinks they're gonna be soft.

09:54.790 --> 09:55.950
Well, are you worried?

09:56.060 --> 09:58.654
Uh, it's not on my schedule,
so I guess I'm not.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.856
I know this is the hard part

10:01.960 --> 10:04.599
but after the election
comes the fun, right?

10:04.700 --> 10:05.769
- Right.
- 'Alright.‘

10:05.870 --> 10:07.132
Family bonding time is over

10:07.240 --> 10:09.128
we have our radio interview
In two mInutes.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.730
Okay.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.728
- Best of luck!
- Thanks, honey.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.728
- Later.
- Later.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.273
- Bye.
- So, explain this to me.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.371
Yes, these are
the main talking points.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.742
(Veronica)
'Uh-huh'

10:19.850 --> 10:21.078
(male #1)
'I did a little pre-screening.‘

10:21.180 --> 10:23.045
- 'He's not gonna ask that.‘
- 'No, no, no!'

10:25.920 --> 10:27.808
[sighs]

10:29.360 --> 10:31.681
[instrumental music]

10:31.790 --> 10:34.156
[knocking]

10:36.730 --> 10:38.960
- Emily.
- Hey.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.091
You're closed?

10:42.200 --> 10:45.658
We_ had an accident
last night, a malfunction.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.332
What kind of a malfunction?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.305
Our one
of the freezer units failed.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.207
We lost everything
in the unit.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.871
I'm sorry but it was the unit
with your donated eggs.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.985
It wasn't just me,
was it?

11:01.090 --> 11:02.921
We're cross-checking
but there are something

11:03.030 --> 11:05.055
like 30 clients involved.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.696
Thirty people?

11:07.860 --> 11:09.691
There are backups.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.427
And the backups have backups

11:11.530 --> 11:13.737
but everything failed.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.161
The power was cut,
the alarms..

11:16.270 --> 11:18.830
Everything.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.272
I have to get back.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.302
We're still making calls.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.970
[music continues]

11:38.530 --> 11:41.158
[clattering]

11:50.940 --> 11:53.704
[instrumental music]

12:05.390 --> 12:06.948
Jordan?

12:07.520 --> 12:09.215
Jordan?

12:11.130 --> 12:12.722
[knock on door]

12:15.530 --> 12:17.760
Hey, did you order breakfast?

12:17.870 --> 12:19.724
Someone left this tray outside.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.989
Where were you?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.738
Just went down stairs
to make some calls

12:22.840 --> 12:24.865
and use the Wi-Fi
without waking you.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.801
Sorry, I should've
left a note.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.002
Well, don't do that,
don't leave

12:28.110 --> 12:29.907
without telling me
where you're going.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.409
Hanna, are you okay?

12:31.510 --> 12:34.741
Yes, I'm fine, we just..
We have to go.

12:34.850 --> 12:36.112
Where would we be going?

12:36.220 --> 12:38.142
Back to Rosewood.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.457
Okay, I-I'll call the driver
we'll get out of here.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.188
Uh, have some breakfast.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.155
I didn't order any.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.751
Oh, it's must be
on the house then.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.260
[intense music]

13:08.280 --> 13:10.089
(Alison)
'When did it start again?‘

13:10.190 --> 13:12.408
(Spencer)
After Charlotte's funeral.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.784
After Sara came back.

13:14.890 --> 13:18.781
Look, Ali,
whoever this person is..

13:18.890 --> 13:21.358
...they think we know
who killed your sister.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.894
'Do you have any idea
who could have done it?'

13:25.370 --> 13:28.828
I know that Charlotte
hurt a lot of people but..

13:28.940 --> 13:30.066
...for someone
to kill her..

13:30.170 --> 13:33.469
No, Ali, whoever's
threatening us now, who..

13:33.580 --> 13:35.502
Whoever's stealing Emily's eggs

13:35.610 --> 13:37.840
and sending us pictures
of golf clubs

13:37.950 --> 13:39.440
'that person
didn't kill Charlotte'

13:39.550 --> 13:41.916
they want revenge
for what happened to her.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.578
What golf club?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.487
The murder weapon
was a golf club.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.478
No, it wasn't.

13:47.590 --> 13:50.081
What Detective Tanner described
was a hollow piece of metal

13:50.190 --> 13:51.987
cut with a rectangle at the end.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.359
Are we getting punked?

13:55.460 --> 13:57.121
'The picture, the golf club'

13:57.230 --> 13:58.891
maybe this is
some kinda of joke?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.297
I don't think
it could be a joke.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.960
I mean, Sara doesn't have any
sense of humor left.

14:03.070 --> 14:05.106
Guys...have either of you

14:05.210 --> 14:07.838
heard of a restaurant
called The Two Crows?

14:07.940 --> 14:09.373
[intense music]

14:10.480 --> 14:12.402
But you are in touch
with them?

14:13.650 --> 14:16.983
Yeah, it's a one way
communication.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.114
Hmm.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.359
The point is
our boss is excited

14:20.460 --> 14:22.985
and it would be a good thing
for us to keep her that way.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.981
Has he sent you more pages?

14:27.530 --> 14:30.090
- Yeah.
- Can I see them?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.428
I thought ifI came here
I could read them

14:31.530 --> 14:33.395
without you having to put them
on the internet.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.639
Yeah. Yeah.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.901
- I'll show you the pages.
- Great.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.875
Jillian had some notes
about Tom.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.641
I wanted to head off
any problems.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.308
What kind of notes?

14:45.410 --> 14:46.570
(Emily)
'1 was just actually'

14:46.680 --> 14:48.511
looking forward to it.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.212
I'm sorry, Em.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.947
I didn't know you weren't
gonna keep them anyway

14:52.050 --> 14:54.314
but I'm so sorry.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.423
I keep thinking about all those
other women and couples.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.454
You know, someone would do that
just to steal my eggs.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.495
Well, first off, I think
that you should stay here.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.023
You have enough to deal with,
without having to..

15:06.130 --> 15:08.030
...keep up the shields
with your mother.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.929
Yeah, I think,
that's an excellent idea.

15:19.310 --> 15:21.574
When I was driving back
into town, I..

15:21.680 --> 15:23.443
...past that
"Welcome to Rosewood" sign

15:23.550 --> 15:25.586
and I kept thinking..

15:25.690 --> 15:28.955
...why did we come back and why
can't we stay away from here?

15:29.060 --> 15:31.278
What does this creep
want from us?

15:31.390 --> 15:33.597
They want us to lead them
to Charlotte's killer.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.951
Why us?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.324
Because we wanted
Charlotte dead.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.361
I mean, think about it.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.598
All the people
who could've killed Charlotte..

15:43.710 --> 15:45.007
...they might have done it
because they thought

15:45.110 --> 15:46.429
that's what we wanted.

15:47.710 --> 15:50.474
What kind of nut
would think that?

15:50.580 --> 15:53.344
The kind who would
hold my eggs for ransom..

15:53.450 --> 15:55.668
...and destroy a freezer
full of potential babies

15:55.780 --> 15:57.486
just to get them.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.945
[music continues]

16:00.720 --> 16:02.381
* We're done playing nice

16:02.490 --> 16:03.559
* Nice

16:03.660 --> 16:05.981
* So don't be a martyr

16:07.230 --> 16:08.959
* We've got to be harder

16:09.060 --> 16:10.391
[door opens]

16:13.400 --> 16:15.493
* We came here to fight..

16:15.600 --> 16:16.965
Hello, Spencer.

16:17.070 --> 16:19.607
* And that's just
a part of life *

16:19.710 --> 16:22.099
* And that's just
a part of life.. **

16:22.210 --> 16:24.508
What happens if I just
ask you something straight out?

16:25.810 --> 16:28.040
Try it and see.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.345
Did you tell Yvonne
to leave her phone at lunch?

16:31.790 --> 16:33.155
Yes.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.216
To prove to her
that she shouldn't trust me.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.524
That's what I told her.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.019
Yeah, but then you
never told her that I took it.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.388
No.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.627
Because that's not really
why you set it up.

16:45.730 --> 16:48.164
You wanted me to have it,
you wanted me to find something.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.131
[sighs]

16:50.240 --> 16:53.038
That sounds very elaborate.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.437
Yes, but this way
it wouldn't look

16:54.540 --> 16:57.008
like you're passing me
campaign information?

16:57.110 --> 16:58.304
You could have
plausible deniability

16:58.410 --> 17:00.378
if I ever
actually found something.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.083
I'm sorry..

17:04.190 --> 17:06.283
...about your mother, Spencer.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.017
I'm praying
that she'll be alright.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.008
Why did you go
through all this trouble?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.552
Because it's wrong..

17:11.660 --> 17:14.049
...what they wanna do.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.799
The campaign's gonna leak
the report.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.425
It'll look like your mother
is unworthy of the public trust.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.695
Does Yvonne know?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.665
I'm sure she doesn't.

17:24.770 --> 17:25.737
I doubt her mother knows

17:25.840 --> 17:27.603
plausible deniability.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.371
Right.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.112
[scoffs]

17:33.220 --> 17:35.347
Oh, my God,
Spence, are you..

17:35.450 --> 17:37.441
You didn't know
your mother was sick?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.454
I'm so sorry,
I-I thought that you must--

17:42.560 --> 17:44.221
Thank you, Mona.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.366
What the clinic tell
about the accident?

17:52.470 --> 17:56.133
- Mechanical failure.
- And she believes that?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.537
What do you mean
does she believe it?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.302
Well, the way we rushed
back here, I wondered if..

18:00.410 --> 18:01.604
...maybe she thought
it was more than that.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.678
Because she's a woman
pumped With hormones?

18:03.780 --> 18:05.304
Because of the things
she's been through

18:05.410 --> 18:07.071
with you and your friends
in the past.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.545
Okay, so she's not hormonal

18:08.650 --> 18:11.380
she's paranoid,
is that what you mean?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.482
I don't think I'm doing
very well in this conversation.

18:14.590 --> 18:15.716
You started it.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.481
Because I'm worried about you.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.478
Look, I've had a rough
couple of days, okay?

18:19.590 --> 18:21.421
Hanna, I've never seen you
wound so tight.

18:21.530 --> 18:24.363
I buried someone
who made my life hell for years.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.132
I'm now being questioned
in her murder. I lost my job--

18:27.240 --> 18:29.299
Bad things happen all the time.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.459
Conspiracies are harder
to come by.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.502
Someone tried to hurt you

18:34.610 --> 18:37.738
and they went to amazingly
complex lengths to do that.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.670
That person is dead.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.749
If you keep looking for things
in the shadows I guarantee you

18:42.850 --> 18:46.149
you're gonna start seeing them.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.309
Come back to New York with me.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.485
I can't.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.126
Emily needs me.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.629
Yeah?

18:54.730 --> 18:56.618
What does Hanna need?

19:02.270 --> 19:05.137
[birds chirping]

19:07.510 --> 19:10.399
[clock ticking]

19:10.510 --> 19:12.398
[sighs]

19:24.590 --> 19:26.558
What do you think?

19:27.960 --> 19:31.225
What's that Dr. 0 quote?

19:31.330 --> 19:33.696
Good writing doesn't tell you
it's raining..

19:33.800 --> 19:36.735
...it lets you feel what
it's like to be rained upon.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.562
You like it?

19:39.670 --> 19:42.332
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's beautiful.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.171
Wait, you said
that Julian had notes.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.713
Well, nothing that
can't be addressed.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.687
Sometimes there's
a shift in language.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.553
Conflicting voices.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.625
You're former teacher's
a terrific writer.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.789
Gives me a rush reading
his stuff in manuscript.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.623
Same sort of rush I get
when I read your writing.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.395
Well, he was my teacher.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.331
Hmm.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.634
You wrote this.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.732
Not all of it,
but big parts of it.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.717
I-I might have...
cleaned up the syntax.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.210
You put in the man
with the straw hat.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.345
The one we saw at Logan.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.715
- God, you were with me.
- Mm-hmm.

20:29.820 --> 20:33.358
I got a funny feeling
after I read the second chapter.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.349
I thought I'd better
take a look.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.792
This...is even more you.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.777
Is Ezra Fitz here in Rosewood?
Maybe a little incapacitated?

20:52.910 --> 20:55.014
Hmm.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.769
Does he know what you're doing?

20:56.880 --> 21:00.680
And what exactly...
do you think you're doing?

21:03.790 --> 21:05.951
Do you believe her?

21:06.060 --> 21:08.494
I think it's the truth.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.865
It might be the truth,
but you believe Mona?

21:11.970 --> 21:13.369
You believe why she did this?

21:13.470 --> 21:15.961
I don't think anybody knows
why Mona does anything

21:16.070 --> 21:17.708
including Mona.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.973
But there's the file,
that's the reality.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.775
What did your mom say?

21:24.550 --> 21:25.949
I don't know, I couldn't..

21:26.050 --> 21:28.416
I couldn't even talk to her.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.784
Look, you are already
in the Phillips computer.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.417
Can't you just corrupt the file?
Can you erase the report?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.657
They can't say anything
because they

21:35.760 --> 21:37.318
shouldn't have it
in the first place!

21:37.430 --> 21:39.682
Spencer, right now,
I'm a fly on the wall

21:39.790 --> 21:42.429
the minute that I do anything,
like, delete a file

21:42.530 --> 21:44.498
'red lights go off everywhere.‘

21:44.600 --> 21:46.693
I am breaking the law
just by being in there.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.434
You know what
she has to do, right?

21:56.540 --> 21:58.940
Your mom has to go
public with this.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.847
She has to get in front
of the story before

22:00.950 --> 22:02.838
the other side leaks it.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.989
It's her secret, not mine.

22:07.090 --> 22:08.557
Well, one way or another

22:08.660 --> 22:10.787
it's not gonna be
a secret much longer.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.620
[cell phone beeps]

22:18.900 --> 22:20.458
[sighs]

22:26.610 --> 22:28.771
I never intended _
to actually start writing it.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.541
Ijust..

22:30.650 --> 22:32.902
...wanted to keep
Julian interested.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.511
Well, you did that.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.019
[sighs]
Is Ezra gonna be

22:36.120 --> 22:37.109
in big trouble over this?

22:37.220 --> 22:39.085
How come you're not asking

22:39.190 --> 22:40.714
if you're gonna be in trouble?

22:40.820 --> 22:42.879
Well, I just took
that for granted.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.878
There's a fine line between

22:46.990 --> 22:49.493
trouble and...high adventure.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.961
I think you should
finish the chapter.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.664
If he's not back by then,
we'll figure something out.

22:56.770 --> 22:57.805
He'll be back.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.899
I think you're right

22:59.010 --> 23:00.409
he'll probably be back.

23:00.510 --> 23:01.829
But when he does,
you'll have to explain

23:01.940 --> 23:04.943
all this creative writing
you've been doing and why.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.644
How do you think
he's gonna feel about that?

23:09.550 --> 23:13.088
I poked the bear
and the bear stole Emily's eggs.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.852
We poked the bear together.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.086
So, it is our fault.

23:17.190 --> 23:19.385
What happened to Emily?

23:19.490 --> 23:22.527
No. Bullies don't
need an excuse.

23:22.630 --> 23:24.063
They're just bullies.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.058
I bet that A was planning this
as soon as they found out

23:26.170 --> 23:28.138
what Emily was up to.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.969
You said "A."

23:30.070 --> 23:31.935
I mean, what do you
want me to call it, Waldo?

23:32.040 --> 23:35.601
No, it's not A.
It's not the same person.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.541
It's-it's just a letter,
a symbol.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.619
You know, it's like...
an algebra problem.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.041
Solve this equation for A.

23:43.150 --> 23:45.812
Yeah. I can't tell you
how much algebra comes up

23:45.920 --> 23:47.581
in my everyday life.

23:47.690 --> 23:51.126
It's not the same person,
but they want the same thing.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.994
They wanna make you miserable.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.988
But this time, you are smarter

23:56.100 --> 23:58.421
and you're stronger.

23:58.530 --> 23:59.428
And you know that
you can beat this

23:59.530 --> 24:01.839
because you have done it before.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.745
So, when did you go
all micro-brew?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.545
[clears throat]

24:12.650 --> 24:15.676
Couple of years ago.
Mostly because of Toby.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.544
We kept threatening
to open a brewery.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.709
Well, maybe you will.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.458
Maybe.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.982
Things have changed though.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.581
Personal dynamics are different.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.749
Yeah, I guess so.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.231
If you have to go..

24:36.340 --> 24:37.830
Yeah, actually..

24:37.940 --> 24:40.135
...there are some things
I need to take care of, so..

24:40.240 --> 24:42.731
Oh, no, no, no. It's good.

24:42.840 --> 24:43.772

Who's your friend?

25:03.770 --> 25:06.591
Uh, this is Harvey.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.590
He really likes
your hors d'oeuvres.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.930
Well, he better,
they cost enough.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.972
I don't think Sybil
likes me very much.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.173
Who's Sybil?

25:19.280 --> 25:20.269
Your new boss.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.610
[chuckles]
Her name is Celeste.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.848
Ah...I called her Sybil.

25:25.950 --> 25:28.009
Probably why
she doesn't like me.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.852
She looks like a Sybil, though.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.895
All these designers that
you work for look like Sybil's.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.864
I can't keep track.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.064
I thought that
you wanted to come here.

[sighs]
I've been buried in work
for three weeks.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.076
I wanted to be with you.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.068
Then come back inside.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.681
So, um..

26:01.790 --> 26:03.985
...do you wanna go
to the Hamptons next weekend?

26:04.090 --> 26:06.923
The Hamptons are just
another part of Manhattan

26:07.030 --> 26:09.590
except it takes three hours
to get there.

26:12.330 --> 26:14.298
What do you want?

What do you want?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.137
I want to be in a place
where we don't have to

ask each other what we want.

to just...sort of knowing

- Yeah. I'm sure.

Will I see you at the apartment?

Where else would I go?

We didn't have much choice.

I know you've all got
your own lives, things to do..

27:40.350 --> 27:43.729
...and staying in Rosewood
has got to be a sacrifice.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.048
It certainly is for me.

we're strangers here.

of the old town?

In some ways, yes.
In other ways, not so much.

it's different.

to Charlotte DiLaurentis

and your friends weren't here

But when everybody
gets together..

28:13.920 --> 28:16.684
...I just think that's
a very interesting statistic

28:16.790 --> 28:17.950
don't you?

28:18.060 --> 28:20.153
I don't know about statistics.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.455
I just know that
Alison deserves some answers.

I'm glad you feel that way.

to keep all interested parties

it was just Charlotte and me.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.926
My dad didn't want anything
to do with us.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.368
Jason was
at the Carissimi Group.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.909
We were alone..

taking care of Charlotte.

Dr. Rollins
saved Charlotte's soul..

...and you fell
in love with him.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.841
At first, I thought
it was gratitude..

30:27.550 --> 30:30.212
...but it wasn't.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.925
And then I realized
it was mutual.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.096
And it was also inappropriate

30:36.200 --> 30:38.259
because he was
your Sister's doctor.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.231
In one way
Charlotte and I are alike.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.832
We put a lot of energy

30:46.940 --> 30:49.500
into being people
no one could love.

Like we were trying
to prove something.

..and sees you,
and it's alright.

Ten even.

I was gonna talk to Spencer.

would try and stop me.

telling her about us?

34:06.710 --> 34:08.701
It helped.

Helped?

I think there's
an argument to be made

34:23.360 --> 34:25.328
for keeping it the way it is.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.250
For now.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.591
I guess we could do that.

34:30.700 --> 34:34.136
But then we're gonna be
having this conversation in..

34:34.240 --> 34:35.730
...a month..

34:35.840 --> 34:37.489
...or a year.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.158
And I don't think
I can take that.

34:39.270 --> 34:42.239
I know
it's been difficult, but..

34:42.340 --> 34:43.602
...I wanna protect you.

34:43.710 --> 34:46.201
You don't have to
protect me from rumors.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.677
They can't hurt me.

34:48.780 --> 34:50.316
Not anymore.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.411
But if you're
afraid for yourself

34:52.520 --> 34:53.839
well, that's..

34:53.950 --> 34:56.214
...that's something else.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.481
What do you want, Alison?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.590
I want something
very complicated.

35:04.930 --> 35:08.297
I want you to take me
to a movie.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.130
I want you to hold my hand
in a restaurant.

35:12.910 --> 35:16.232
[instrumental music]

35:18.880 --> 35:22.179
[leaves rustling]

35:23.220 --> 35:24.585
We should've waited for Spencer.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.250
No, we have to get there
before Sara has a chance

35:27.350 --> 35:29.181
to take Emily's eggs
out of the mini-bar.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.382
I don't think
she shoved them in there

35:30.490 --> 35:32.378
with those $7 orange juice.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.594
God, my mom thought she got
rid of all the Radley ghosts.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.190
Wait till she finds out
about this.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.528
She'll be down here
with a jackhammer.

35:37.630 --> 35:38.790
[thudding]

35:38.900 --> 35:41.266
(Aria)
What was that?

35:41.370 --> 35:43.895
Do you think that's Sara?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.865
Maybe she needs a hand.

35:45.970 --> 35:49.235
[intense music]

35:50.810 --> 35:54.143
[grunting]

35:58.790 --> 36:01.418
[panﬁng]

36:05.490 --> 36:07.287
I wanted to see for myself,
and I thought

36:07.390 --> 36:09.927
maybe there was an old freezer
or something down there.

36:10.030 --> 36:13.591
There's nothing.
No electricity, no nothing.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.567
Why didn't you tell us?
We could've gone with you.

36:16.670 --> 36:19.707
I wanted to go alone,
in case I found them.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.539
The desk clerk said
nobody's seen Sara Harvey

36:21.640 --> 36:23.437
since she left the hotel
last night.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.768
Where is she?

36:25.910 --> 36:27.571
I don't know, probably
in some other hole somewhere.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.511
I'm sorry about
grabbing your boob, Em.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.418
Don't worry about it.
I just have to face it.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.317
One way or another,
my eggs are gone.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.684
Look, Emily, you have the money.

36:36.790 --> 36:40.180
Use it. Finish school.
That's what you wanted.

36:40.290 --> 36:41.655
That's why you
put yourself through this.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.193
Yeah, Hana's right.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.268
What happened was terrible

36:45.370 --> 36:47.292
but you're not responsible.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.328
Bullies don't need excuses.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.465
You can always
donate them again.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.731
Just remember
to keep some for yourself.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.206
Yeah, Ijust wanna be
with someone when that happens.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.746
And so far my relationships
have all been challenging.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.738
Well, you will have kids

37:02.850 --> 37:04.818
you will have kids,
Spencer will have kids

37:04.920 --> 37:08.617
I will have kids, and we will
all have beautiful babies.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.756
- More visualizations?
- Absolutely.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.488
Just wait till you see what
I've planned for our playdates.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.555
[fire crackling]

37:16.660 --> 37:17.820
[door opens]

37:19.770 --> 37:21.226
[door closes]

37:23.040 --> 37:24.405
Hey.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.329
Hey.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.600
You know I was thinking..

37:29.710 --> 37:32.508
...maybe the other side
won't use it.

37:32.610 --> 37:35.511
Maybe they'll have...
an attack of conscience

37:35.620 --> 37:38.783
and, uh...take the high road.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.812
Well, there's never
any traffic up there.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.456
Hmm.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.288
How's your mom?

37:46.390 --> 37:48.392
She's tired.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.798
But she's happy.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.788
She's really happy.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.565
And how about you?

37:59.540 --> 38:01.633
'You need anything?‘

38:02.580 --> 38:07.404
* What a thing to do-o-o

38:07.510 --> 38:09.569
I need you to go get a glass

38:09.680 --> 38:11.409
'cause your girlfriend's
drinking all by herself

38:11.520 --> 38:12.839
and it's real sad.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.417
[chuckling]

38:14.520 --> 38:16.283
That I can do.

38:16.390 --> 38:20.520
* And now I can't sleep

38:23.430 --> 38:27.298
* Knowing that you got to me

38:29.570 --> 38:36.408
* This is just a ga-a-ame

38:36.510 --> 38:39.570
* You played me like a fool

38:39.680 --> 38:44.686
* You played me like a fool *

38:44.790 --> 38:45.779
I'm sorry.

38:47.850 --> 38:49.556
No, I...should be honored

38:49.660 --> 38:51.855
that you thought
I would kill someone for you.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.622
Ezra, I was afraid.

38:54.730 --> 38:57.392
Alright? I-I felt all of this
just starting over again.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.559
It was terrible.

39:00.830 --> 39:02.559
Look the night
Charlotte was killed

39:02.670 --> 39:04.763
after I left you, I..

39:05.810 --> 39:07.505
...I wanted to tell you
where I went

39:07.610 --> 39:09.737
but I was asked not to.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.104
- 'By who?‘
- By your dad.

39:12.210 --> 39:14.519
And your mom.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.338
I saw them in town..

39:17.450 --> 39:19.611
...and they...
didn't want you to know

39:19.720 --> 39:21.483
that they were getting close
to getting back together

39:21.590 --> 39:22.887
so they asked me
not to tell you.

39:22.990 --> 39:25.629
And it all seemed_
very innocent at the time.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.119
So I...went to the House of Pies

39:28.230 --> 39:30.721
and I ended up
having a three-hour conversation

39:30.830 --> 39:32.627
about politics
with a trucker named Earl

39:32.730 --> 39:33.958
and then I went home afterwards.

39:34.070 --> 39:35.799
Why did you not tell me
all of this when we

39:35.900 --> 39:37.629
showed up here
like a bunch of vigilantes

39:37.740 --> 39:38.729
accusing you of murder?

39:38.840 --> 39:41.707
Because I was so angry at you.

39:41.810 --> 39:44.802
Ijust...got in the car
and drove away.

39:44.910 --> 39:49.119
And I was about
20 miles outside of town when..

39:49.220 --> 39:50.448
...I started to think
about all the lies

39:50.550 --> 39:52.518
that I've told you.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.087
Everything that
I've...talked you into

39:54.190 --> 39:55.748
everything that
I've talked myself into

39:55.860 --> 39:59.159
and it was always
for a good cause.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.728
Of course,
you thought I would do it.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.498
I made sure of that myself.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.659
So I..

40:07.770 --> 40:09.795
What I'm trying
to say is that I..

40:09.900 --> 40:12.539
...I'm the one
that should say sorry.

40:16.610 --> 40:18.908
Well, my parents
are getting remarried.

40:19.010 --> 40:20.568
Oh.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.739
Well, I guess it was worth
keeping that secret.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.656
Ezra, where were you?

40:33.760 --> 40:35.022
Albany.

40:35.130 --> 40:36.552
. (Aria)
Albany?‘

40:36.660 --> 40:38.560
The state university there.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.023
Buddy in the English Department

40:40.130 --> 40:42.030
and he let me crash.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.832
What's this?

40:47.510 --> 40:49.000
The new book.

40:49.110 --> 40:51.431
The next three chapters.

40:51.550 --> 40:52.778
I would like you to read it

40:52.880 --> 40:54.848
before I send it
to the publisher.

40:54.950 --> 40:57.839
[instrumental music]

41:02.860 --> 41:04.487
Alright. Ahem.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.455
- We should go to bed.
- Yeah.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.495
Oh. No, one more thing.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.563
[sighs]

41:14.170 --> 41:16.035
[intense music]

41:16.140 --> 41:17.664
What's wrong?

41:18.710 --> 41:21.873
Melissa's suitcase is broken.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.074
And there's a part missing
that's metal..

41:25.180 --> 41:27.944
