00:14.431 --> 00:17.058
You did it! You did it!

00:18.000 --> 00:19.100
Come here!

00:19.200 --> 00:21.058
You just hit it big time!

00:21.605 --> 00:23.264
You just won the Big Bundle!

00:23.315 --> 00:24.974
And what a bundle it is, Ron!

00:25.025 --> 00:27.944
Do you realize you just won $50,000?

00:29.655 --> 00:31.030
There you are.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.191
Yeah, that's only the beginning.

00:33.242 --> 00:35.818
The Really Big Bundle is that
you're going to have a week

00:35.869 --> 00:38.379
at the most fabulous resort in the world.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.072
You're going to Delos, Ron!

00:40.123 --> 00:41.824
- Delos!
- That's right, Delos.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.202
Where you may choose Roman World,

00:44.253 --> 00:45.578
a lusty treat for the senses,

00:45.629 --> 00:47.914
where beautiful robot women
are yours to command

00:47.965 --> 00:50.750
and robot gladiators die
at the point of your sword.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.253
Or Medieval World, an exact
reconstruction of 13th century Europe,

00:54.304 --> 00:56.452
where you may live like an absolute king.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.382
Or Spa World, a garden of pleasure,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.426
where old age and pain
have been eliminated.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.638
Or Futureworld, where you will be
transported throughout the solar system,

01:03.689 --> 01:05.723
commanding you very own rocket ship,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.518
enjoying the favors of robot women
of weightless beauty,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.686
soaring through space like an astronaut.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.939
All that and more is yours, Ron.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.865
Congratulations.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.365
You keep following me?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.619
Bye, Mac.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.240
Hello, Shorty.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.409
How many points you gonna give
on the Colts?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.377
- Seven.
- Seven?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.297
I got 50 says you're wrong.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.375
Ain't never gonna get rich being stupid.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.711
Just say I got a hunch.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.263
- I read your column today.
- Yeah, what'd you think?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.716
It's gonna wrap a lot of garbage.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.392
Yeah, quack, quack, quack.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.851
Hey, you behind on your bills?

04:36.902 --> 04:37.977
Good morning to you too.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.731
Some guy's been calling for you
every five minutes for the last two hours.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.274
Driving me nuts!

04:43.325 --> 04:44.992
- Get a number?
- Nope.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.030
City desk, Browning.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.449
<i>Is this Chuck Browning?</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:52.450
That's right.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.453
Look, you wrote a story a couple of
years ago about the trouble at Westworld.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.495
You're the same guy, right?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.663
You bet.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.624
<i>I got a story for you, maybe a big one.</i>

05:00.675 --> 05:01.876
All right, tell me.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.544
<i>You crazy? I ain't giving it away.</i>

05:03.595 --> 05:05.629
<i>I'm in trouble. I need some money.</i>

05:05.680 --> 05:07.840
- Okay, how much?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

05:07.891 --> 05:10.176
All I want is for you to meet me somewhere.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.219
I'll tell you what I got,
you pay me what it's worth.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.262
All right, what's your name?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.849
<i>Frenchy. Frenchy DuPorte.</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:19.977
Mee tme in ten mimutes at the
Hyatt Regency crossover, Frenchy.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.020
<i>What do you look like?</i>

05:21.071 --> 05:22.313
I seen your picture.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.614
<i>I'll find you.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.026
Anything?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.744
It's my day for long shots.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.173
Frenchy?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.558
What's the matter?

05:54.771 --> 05:55.980
Frenchy, what happened?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.015
Delos.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.275
What?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.820
Delos.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.168
- You're late.
- You're right.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.959
Two years ago, the worst day
in the history of Delos

06:25.010 --> 06:28.170
began with no obvious signs
that anything would go wrong.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.840
The robots were behaving as programmed.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.051
And although there was some evidence
of circuit malfunction,

06:34.102 --> 06:36.303
it was well within the normal parameters.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.000
Mr. Dyffy, are you saying that despite
your sophisticated sensors,

06:40.051 --> 06:42.184
- What the hell are you doing here?
- <i>you had absolutely no indication about it?</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:43.235
- Later.
- <i>None at all.</i>

06:43.987 --> 06:46.000
Then quite suddenly,

06:46.114 --> 06:49.108
one of our most complicated
robot gunslingers

06:49.159 --> 06:52.695
began to act in a most vicious manner.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.321
For the first time in our history,

06:54.372 --> 06:56.282
a robot actually killed a guest.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.600
Within a few moments

06:58.710 --> 07:01.412
Delos was in turmoil.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.164
I thought your only problem
was in Westworld?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.917
No, thanks to your Mr. Browning,

07:06.968 --> 07:09.962
Westworld got the brunt of the bad publicity,

07:10.013 --> 07:12.806
but the breakdown occured
throughout the resort.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.758
Mr. Duffy, I don't quite understand

07:14.809 --> 07:17.227
why you didn't shut off
the power supply to your robots.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.762
We did.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.266
But they ran on reserve long enough
to do a great deal of damage.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.850
- How many guests were killed?
- More than 50.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.863
And of course, many of our own
technicians also died.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.235
In fact, by the time we regained control,

07:33.286 --> 07:36.030
95 members of our technical
and maintenance staff

07:36.081 --> 07:37.740
had either been killed or wounded.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.325
Aside from the human loss,

07:39.376 --> 07:43.545
It was a financial and public relations
disaster of the first magnitude.

07:45.757 --> 07:49.627
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
those of us who have devoted our lives

07:49.678 --> 07:53.756
to creating Delos, were stunned
by the events I've just shown you.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.808
Yet, we did not lose faith.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.969
Now, for the last two years,

07:59.020 --> 08:05.275
we have invested more than 1.5 billion
dollars to rebuild our equipement.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.438
We have replaced every circuit,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.899
every program, every robot.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.946
The new Delos is not only the most
fantastic resort in human history,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.039
it is also fail-safe.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.909
Now, last month, as you know,

08:21.960 --> 08:24.036
we re-opened the resort.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.000
Public response has been good,

08:26.051 --> 08:28.749
but, quite frankly,
not as good as it should be.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.128
Our problem is the memory
of a disaster at Westworld.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.638
And that's why we've come to you.

08:34.972 --> 08:40.635
We offer the IMC Network
an absolute exclusive story for all media.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.722
Every phase of our operation
will be open to you.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.724
And all we ask in return

08:45.775 --> 08:50.029
is that you treat us
in a fair and positive manner.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.814
Arthur.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.316
Arthur, you mustn't do this to me.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.152
Not for one damn minute, do you hear me?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.320
They can hear you in the lobby, honey.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.571
I'm not talking to you, mister!

08:59.622 --> 09:02.950
Listen, you promised me that
the Delos story would be mine.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.829
Exclusive to television
and exclusive to me, is that right?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.747
- Yes.
- Then will you tell me why

09:08.798 --> 09:12.876
this ink-stained Neanderthal
was invited to our meeting?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.753
He has an angle. I want to pursue it.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.171
Well, let's call it a hunch.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.348
Oh, wonderful.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.804
And when the people at Delos find out
that you have sent Mr. Bad News himself,

09:23.855 --> 09:25.829
that's the end of our exclusive.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.975
I told Mr. Duffy what I had in mind.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.101
He has no objection.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.021
- Well, I do!
- Yes, I gathered as much.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.898
But I would like to remind you
that while you are indeed

09:34.949 --> 09:37.693
a glamorous and highly paid
television correspondent,

09:37.744 --> 09:38.861
you're still an employee.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.739
In fact, you're my employee.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.408
And unless you would like
to spend the next five years

09:44.459 --> 09:47.911
doing weather and fashion
in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,

09:47.962 --> 09:50.214
you will now shut up and do as you're told.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.082
Oh, yes?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.917
Yes, Arthur?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.385
We'll see about that.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.053
Excuse me.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.637
Socks, come on, lighten up.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.722
Oh, what do you want?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.265
Well, I just want to tell you I like your style.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.726
You had old Holcombe there
swallowing his corporate stripes.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.236
You mean you're sorry you fired me?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.646
That was 'cause you weren't
a very good reporter.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.565
Listen, I was a kid out of college
who happened to think

10:16.616 --> 10:19.193
that newspapers ought to be more
than dirt and bad news.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.036
That sounds like a line from an old movie.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.616
You know, you'd think that
even so dumb a brain as yours

10:25.667 --> 10:26.700
would finally get the message.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.953
I happen to have 55 million viewers
worldwide.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.123
You've got a couple thousand old crones
in the public library.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.750
Why don't you wise up, mister?

10:34.801 --> 10:35.793
Nobody reads.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.628
Well, then you've got nothing to worry about.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.138
Now, come on, let's have a truce.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.340
I don't trust you.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.008
Well, you like me a little, don't you?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.094
Anyway, we've got a week
to spend together alone,

10:45.145 --> 10:46.270
so what the hell?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.473
I don't like being called Socks.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.891
Well, I can't help that.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.102
The first time that I was with you,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.028
you had those outrageous red socks on.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.855
Took me a week to get over that.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.233
Yeah, and then you fired me.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.110
Well, now listen, that was business.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.486
Now, come on, what do you say?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.279
Truce, huh?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.998
I'll think about it.

11:27.562 --> 11:31.974
General Karnovski regrets,
but he does not give interviews now.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.016
He's on vacation.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.394
Well, listen the right interview
in an important American paper

11:35.445 --> 11:36.645
could be good for the General.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.105
Maybe get him a promotion.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.325
The General does not need a promotion.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.160
You've got a point.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.696
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.948
You mean to tell me that
you've never heared of me?

11:47.999 --> 11:50.075
I mean, really.
I mean, come on, you look at me.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.786
You're putting me on
with those beautiful green eyes.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.289
Honey, I won, the Big Bundle!
The TV contest!

11:55.340 --> 11:56.548
You must've heard of that!

11:58.092 --> 12:01.011
A montage of international types.
I think that would be a good idea.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.047
Well, well, how do you do?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.382
- Terrible.
- Why?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.384
I tried the Iranian oil ministers, nothing.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.635
Karnovski said nyet.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.220
That leaves Takaguchi.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.471
My last shot over there.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.973
What is it that you're after, anyway?

12:13.024 --> 12:15.017
I don't know, this Delos guset list

12:15.068 --> 12:17.352
looks like a rerun from the last
Geneva Conference.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.856
Oil ministers, rocket experts,
heavyweight electronic types.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.193
For God sakes, at $1,200 a day,
who else could afford this?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.528
You know, you are looking
for something that isn't there.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.613
You may be right.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.697
Hey, Miss Ballard.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.284
Miss Ballard, now, listen now,
you have got to put me on your show.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.870
No fooling now, I am a real angle.
Oh, excuse me, pal.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.039
Oh, that's all right. Listen,
why don't you take that seat there?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.071
- Oh, thanks, thanks.
- You bet.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.042
- What's your name?
- Ron Thurlow, Ron.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.074
The Big Bundle, you know?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.502
- Ron, I'm Chuck Browning.
- Hi.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.004
Ron, you don't read, do you?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.547
Me, no, I'm a tube freak.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.882
Right, well, you just sit right there,

12:46.933 --> 12:49.009
'cause I know Miss Ballard loves
to get close to her viewers.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.135
- Oh, thanks.
- You bet.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.220
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.180
- Thanks, pal.
- Anytime.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.766
Nice felllow. Now, listen,
here's the deal, Miss Ballard.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.268
You see, now, I am a common type man,

12:58.319 --> 13:00.687
but you see, right now,
well, I'm a big winner.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.189
Now, that's news, right?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.691
Yes, that's right, Ron,
but let me tell you something.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.110
You see, the video crew
isn't here on this trip.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.654
This is just a research trip, you see.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.697
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.708
- Doggone that's too bad.
- Sorry.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.786
Hey, do you know what this fella told me?

13:15.837 --> 13:18.413
He told me, "Once you make it
with a robot chick,

13:18.464 --> 13:21.000
"that's it, you don't never want nothing else."

13:21.051 --> 13:22.968
I swear to God, that's what he told me.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.555
Are you going to do it?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.349
Do what, Ron?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.727
Have sex with a robot?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.480
Not this trip, Ron.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.350
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

Please, come this way.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.346
Sure will, ooh man,
you are some kind of machnery.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.182
All the girls on Futureworld

15:00.233 --> 15:02.809
Oh, yes, sir, they come
in all shapes and sizes.

15:02.860 --> 15:03.894
Whatever you desire.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.562
Honey, you are perfect.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.022
Oh, no sir, I'm a 500.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.448
I'm not programmed for sex.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.969
- Futureworld, huh?
- Mmm.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.463
Well, Duffy wasn't lying about one thing.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.506
What's that?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.716
This place is three time larger
than the old one.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.385
- Is it?
- You bet, and how.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.304
Well, it's all set, a day or two in Futureworld,

15:39.355 --> 15:40.555
and you can come back stage with me

15:40.606 --> 15:42.808
and see the hard work behind the magic.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.685
Of course, at any time,
you're free to go where you wish.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.104
No restrictions?

15:47.155 --> 15:50.399
Well, for your own safety, we can't
have you wandering off just anywhere.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.068
But whatever you want to see,
we'll be glad to show you.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.454
Well, that's a hell of a lot better
than the last time I was here.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.415
Well, we have blast off
scheduled in half an hour.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.452
And you, Miss Ballard, are
the commander of the flight.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.587
I am?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.749
<i>Medieval World guests are reminded</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:11.294

16:17.518 --> 16:19.469
- Mr. Takaguchi?
- Yes.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.596
I'm very sorry, I've checked with control,

16:21.647 --> 16:23.932
and it's impossible for you
to use your father's sword.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.560
- We're very sorry.
- Quite right, I understand.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.321
Your weapons must, of course,
be very special.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.117
I'm really very nervous.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.452
Oh, no, there's nothing to worry about.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.745
It's all play-like,
we're not really going anywhere.

16:45.796 --> 16:46.922
I don't think.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.624
Ta-da.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.710
- So, how do I look, huh?
- Not too shabby, come on.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.011
Oh, not so bad yourself.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.715
My name is Eric. This is Erica.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.548
Be sure you stay in touch with base,

I've changed my mind.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.967

23:47.009 --> 23:48.376
Who authorized the camera?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.637
No one, sir, they were told not to bring them.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.422
Well, don't make any issue of it,

Everything all right?

24:33.722 --> 24:34.973
Yes, I think so.

Close your fist, please.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.858
Good.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.188

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you sure we can't get hurt?

29:23.345 --> 29:25.004
'Cause I got plans for tonight.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.048
There's really nothing to worry about.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.967
Skiing on Mars is not
that different than on Earth.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.928
Of course, the snow is red.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.305
And gravity is one third.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.357
But your skis are designed for that purpose.

You must remember that I've been

Put your quarter on the table, honey.
We'll get to that one.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.550
I'll be there in a second.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.550
Yes, sir. May I get you something?

30:11.601 --> 30:13.135
You have pretty good memory banks?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.387
I'm a 500, sir.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.300
- We have quite excellent memories.
- Good.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.191
You ever seen that fellow before?

30:22.237 --> 30:23.813
No, sir. Is he a guest?

30:23.864 --> 30:25.573
I guess you'd call him inoperative.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.441
Thanks.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.572
Now, are you sure that they are robots?

30:33.623 --> 30:35.157
- They're not ging to get hurt or anything, are they?
- Positive.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.617
Just pick up the gloves, honey.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.960
Okay.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.130
- Ready?
- Yep.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.270
- Chuck?
- Yeah?

31:01.318 --> 31:03.185
I forgive you everything.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.730
Did you see that?
Did you see that left? Pow!

31:05.781 --> 31:06.856
Terrific.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.274
I'm afraid I interrupted.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.818
Bu I think now would be a good time
for you to come backstage with me.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.612
All the worlds are at full function,
and you do have limited time.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.031
- Good.
- I forgot something.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.832
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.838
Bartender?

31:23.382 --> 31:24.373
Yes, sir?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.292
That photo I showed you earlier,
I forgot to get it back.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.044
Oh, no, sir. I gave you the picture back.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.086
No, you didn't.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.096
Oh, yes, sir.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.424
- You're a liar.
- No, sir.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.508
I'm not programmed to lie.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.686
Well, for a man without a program,
you do a pretty damn good job!

31:38.730 --> 31:40.389
Something wrong?

31:40.440 --> 31:42.183
No.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.434
No, I must've made a mistake.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.855
Well, to err is human.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.231
That must be it.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.450
But it's all right. I have another one.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.286
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

31:54.704 --> 31:57.823
<i>The first space safari to the caves of Venus</i>

31:57.874 --> 32:00.626
<i>is available for sign up at the tour desk.</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:06.248
Mr. Duffy, you know, I wanted to ask you
about those chessmen.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.708
Are they real, or what are they?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.085
No, they're holograms.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.544
Optical illusions.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.389
<i>Everything in Futureworld is perfectly safe.</i>

32:13.849 --> 32:16.058
We don't use this very often, so...

32:17.269 --> 32:18.853
watch your step, huh?

32:23.233 --> 32:25.726
It's hard to belive we never left the ground.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.195
I was convinced that we were really in orbit.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.303
I thought the queen stole that camera.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.681
She did. Apparently, he stole it back.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.808
The Takaguchi horse and lance

33:05.859 --> 33:07.560
are now programmed for combat

33:07.611 --> 33:11.030
with a plus 10 probability of victory
on the first pass.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.258
<i>Begin the joust sequence on my mark.</i>

33:39.309 --> 33:44.021
<i>3, 2, 1, mark.</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:06.911
Guests always win?

34:06.962 --> 34:09.246
We try to make it believable
for them, of course.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.290
But the guests are always the victors.

34:11.341 --> 34:12.333
Mind if we look around?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.967
No, go right ahead.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.597
Please, mark this robot
for pick-up and repair.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.384
Notify Robor Center that
all vital signs were terminated...

34:22.435 --> 34:24.637
You just relax and enjoy yourself.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.522
Take this all in.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.286
Come here a second.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.789
- Where are we going?
- Just come here.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.034
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.168
I want you to pick out one of
these guys and turn him on.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.830
Why would you want me to do that?

34:51.880 --> 34:53.831
- Just trust me.
- Why should I trust you?

34:53.882 --> 34:55.384
Just trust me for once, will you Socks?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.295
Pick out one of these guys
and do a number on him

34:58.346 --> 34:59.713
and get him interested, you know?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.131
What is your game?

35:01.182 --> 35:03.267
It's no game, believe me.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.145
Oh, you do remember
how to get someone interested?

35:08.440 --> 35:11.150
Do I remember how to get
someone interested?

35:12.068 --> 35:13.402
Okay, which one?

35:20.827 --> 35:22.494
Piece of cake.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.795
Hey, you really know what you're doing.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.382
I've been watching you.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.794
I'm Tracy Ballard.

35:38.845 --> 35:39.962
How do you do?

35:40.013 --> 35:41.046
Hi, what's your name?

35:41.097 --> 35:42.306
Steven.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.468
Steven, I'm doing a video special on Delos,

35:46.519 --> 35:49.605
and, God, it's so confusing, you know?

35:51.524 --> 35:53.559
I thought maybe later on
we could get together.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.561
You could sort of help me out.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.780
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.991
Ah, you're married, huh?

36:01.534 --> 36:02.785
No, ma'am.

36:04.621 --> 36:05.704
Well.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.575
Gee, this is a wonderful job,
but don't you kind of get...

36:09.626 --> 36:11.952
a little lonely, Steven?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.295
No, ma'am.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.675
You're not making this easy, Steven.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.919
Tell me, do you think I'm pretty?

36:20.970 --> 36:22.429
Yes, ma'am.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.008
Well, I'm awfully lonely here.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.969
Steven, I... I'd like it--

36:29.020 --> 36:30.220
I'm sorry, ma'am.

36:30.271 --> 36:33.474
All right, begin the spacewalk
sequence on my mark.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.359
Bring the moon up a little fuller, please.

36:36.111 --> 36:40.739
3, 2, 1, mark.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.985
I think you better try him yourself.
I don't think he likes girls.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.320
Yeah, then come on.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.155
What are we trying to prove?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.500
Just come on.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.367
Give me a quantum 9.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.826
- Hey, Duffy.
- You seen enough?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.578
Enough to know that
I'm getting the fast shuffle.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.663
What are you talking about?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.415
Well, in my business we call it
managed news.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.458
Such as?

36:59.509 --> 37:01.502
Such as what's wrong
with all the people in this room?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.921
I mean, are they drugged
or hypnotized or what?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.673
Because they sure as hell aren't normal.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.890
They're normal for robots.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.053
All these people are machines?
That's impossible!

37:11.104 --> 37:13.013
Seems I'm to blame for not explaining.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.725
You see, we discovered that one of the
causes for our disaster with Westworld

37:16.776 --> 37:19.019
lay with the human flaws of our controllers.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.771
So we replaced them with these.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.940
The model 700 technician series.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.274
They have no ego.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.826
So, they have no hang-ups.

37:26.494 --> 37:30.873
And thus, one more source
of error is eliminated.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.324
They're all robots.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.367
I feel very badly.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.043
I was sure that Dr. Schneider had told you.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.457
Prepare the Martian ski sequence
for five guests.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.718
And return power to grid 3.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.121
I'll tell you something, mister.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.082
That is the last time you get me
to flyspeck Delos.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.002
And if you don't stop acting
like such a paranoid idiot,

38:25.053 --> 38:27.129
I hope Duffy throws you out of here.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.214
Well, why didn't he tell us?
I mean, why did he wait?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.257
He forgot.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.885
Isn't that a perfectly normal
human thing to do?

38:32.936 --> 38:34.720
If you weren't so eager to do a hatchet job,

38:34.771 --> 38:36.104
you wouldn't think twice about it.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.372
I thought you should see
what's left of Westworld.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.742
I don't want to be accused
of trying to hide anything.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.869
Oh, now Mr. Duffy, I hope you understand

38:58.920 --> 39:01.246
I don't think you're trying to hide anything.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.123
I think that Delos is wonderful

39:03.174 --> 39:05.876
and I'm sure that's how the story's
going to come out.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.002
That's very gratifying.

39:07.053 --> 39:10.339
Gratifying, yes. Well, I'd like to have
a look around by myself.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.174
If you don't have any objections?

39:12.225 --> 39:13.642
- Not at all.
- Hmm.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.272
Interesting fellow.

39:19.816 --> 39:22.317
- Certainly has a suspicious mind.
- Oh, yes.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.695
He thinks it's admirable.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.482
Chuck?

42:09.819 --> 42:11.403
Chuck, where are you?

42:24.667 --> 42:25.893
Chuck?

42:41.667 --> 42:42.893
Chuck?

42:52.028 --> 42:53.103
Can I give you a hand?

42:53.154 --> 42:55.188
You brat!

42:55.239 --> 42:57.983
I should've known better
than to worry about you.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.326
Tracy.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.120
Damn!

43:03.998 --> 43:07.501
I just... can't decide.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.370
Then don't.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.963
Take us both.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.211
I don't think that would work out.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.629
Why not?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.431
We're both sex models.

43:23.309 --> 43:24.718
Yeah, that's okay for you,

43:24.769 --> 43:27.220
but... I mean...

43:27.271 --> 43:29.898
I mean, what the hell, I'm no Superman.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.776
You'd be surprised.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.979
Well, I'll leave you to yourselves.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.355
Dinner should be along shortly.

43:37.406 --> 43:39.441
Better get plenty of rest.
Got a big day head of us.

43:39.492 --> 43:40.484
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.069
Good night.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.537
Socks.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.698
Aw, come on, Socks, it was only a joke.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.576
My bed is upstairs, yours is downstairs.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.912
Let's make damn sure we keep it that way.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.131
Monitoring diarthrosis objevis.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.626
Hyaline and synovial read-outs recorded.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.636
Status.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.130
We're completing the gross body series.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.216
We'll start molecular studies in one hour.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.967
All right, did you alter their food?

44:06.018 --> 44:08.553
Yes, sir, we should have 4 to 6 hours.

44:08.604 --> 44:11.807
I want all thermal x-ray and electrochemical
studies finished by tonight.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.433
- That's not much time.
- It'll have to do.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.777
Our Mr. Browning is getting
much too curious.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.006
I have a holograph in my screen.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.126
Restructuring. Read-out normal.

44:39.177 --> 44:43.171
<i>Security reports that drugs were added
to the food intake of all four subjects.</i>

44:43.222 --> 44:47.509
<i>The subjects are now asleep and
available for pick-up at 2100 hours.</i>

44:47.560 --> 44:51.146
<i>All subjects should be returned
to their rooms by 0230.</i>

46:47.680 --> 46:49.931
Begin all graphic studies on my mark.

46:50.808 --> 46:51.850
<i>3,</i>

46:52.977 --> 46:54.436
<i>2,</i>

46:55.229 --> 46:56.314
<i>1,</i>

46:56.429 --> 46:57.514
<i>mark.</i>

46:57.565 --> 47:00.725
I am reading the cytoplasmic structure now.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.395
I want the chemical read-outs,
as soon as you've got them.

47:03.446 --> 47:06.481
Affirmative. Carbon, hydrogen,

47:06.532 --> 47:08.483
nitrogen and oxygen readings are up.

47:08.534 --> 47:12.153
Camino cytonic channels, hyperbilia,

47:12.204 --> 47:15.957
mitochondria, endoplasmic
readings are recording.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.982
Magnesium count.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.617
1.7, sir.

48:02.963 --> 48:08.084
Hematology, red cell mass, 2.0 liters.

48:08.135 --> 48:11.054
Hematocrit, 0.44.

48:36.789 --> 48:38.990
<i>This is a time warning to all personnel.</i>

48:40.042 --> 48:42.127
<i>It is now 0210.</i>

48:42.711 --> 48:45.630
<i>All tests must be completed by 0215.</i>

48:46.340 --> 48:50.301
<i>All subjects must be returned to
their sleeping quarters by 0230.</i>

49:16.871 --> 49:18.405
Chuck!

49:18.456 --> 49:20.874
- Chuck! Chuck!
- What's the matter?

49:21.167 --> 49:22.784
Oh, I had this awful deram.

49:22.835 --> 49:24.077
It was horrible.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.788
I was in the hospital and
these peopple kept hurting me.

49:26.839 --> 49:29.082
And kept hurting me,
and I couldn't do anything.

49:29.133 --> 49:30.542
It's all right now, it's over.

49:30.593 --> 49:31.876
Come and sit down.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.500
Here you go, sit down.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.924
I'm sorry, I feel like an idiot.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.643
But... it was so real.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.347
It's no problem. No problem at all.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.200
What are you doing dressed?

49:48.402 --> 49:51.654
Well, to tell the truth, I was on my way
to take a little unauthorized tour.

49:51.906 --> 49:54.732
Oh, no, you can't do that.
That could be dangerous.

49:54.783 --> 49:57.569
Socks, I don't know if I've got
a real story here or not.

49:57.620 --> 50:00.288
But I'm not going to find out
following Duffy around, you know?

50:01.290 --> 50:02.574
If you're going, I'm going.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.409
- Wrong. No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.786
Just because I get mad at you
doesn't mean I want to see you get hurt.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.795
You stay here.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.548
The minute you walk out that door,
I'm going to call Duffy.

50:11.884 --> 50:13.001
Oh, you wouldn't do that.

50:13.052 --> 50:14.919
Try me.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.138
You are the most stubborn woman
I have ever met.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.350
All right, hurry up, go up and change.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.019
But don't take all night!

50:31.737 --> 50:32.729
Where are we going?

50:32.780 --> 50:34.364
Power plant.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.260
What is that, anyway?

51:04.311 --> 51:06.221
Looks like a road map
to all the tunnel systems.

51:06.272 --> 51:07.347
Well, is that good?

51:07.398 --> 51:08.973
- That's bingo, Socks.
- Oh.

51:09.024 --> 51:10.358
Come on, lets go.

51:32.047 --> 51:34.707
It's a 400. It's programmed not to stop us.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.134
- Are you sure?
- No!

51:42.975 --> 51:43.933
That's it.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.144
That's the entrance to the tunnels.

51:50.482 --> 51:51.941
Yep, come on.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.648
Are you sure you know where you're going?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.659
- Not entirely.
- Oh, terrific.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.170
Okay.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.296
Where are we?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.298
Right beneath the Research
and Development area.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.467
If they're keeping any secrets,
this is where they ought to be.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.726
Oh, boy.

53:40.175 --> 53:43.010
Oh, yes. Duffy said they were
building an Eastworld.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.054
Duffy said a lot of things.

53:46.098 --> 53:47.223
Come on.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.975
What are you looking for anyway?

53:58.026 --> 53:59.444
How the hell do I know?

54:02.698 --> 54:04.524
I think we ought to get out of here.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.192
Damn it, we just got here.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.952
Just...

54:09.830 --> 54:11.706
We got to get some light in here.

54:12.374 --> 54:13.541
Hmm.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.119
Hey, you don't know what you're doing.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.121
Don't bother me.
I got an insinct for these things.

54:20.174 --> 54:22.216
Turn it off. Will you turn it off?

54:26.972 --> 54:28.639
Maybe they work in a combination.

54:36.982 --> 54:38.566
How impressive.

55:01.215 --> 55:04.208
Oh, for God's sake, let's get out of here.

55:04.259 --> 55:07.044
You know this is about as exciting
as a visit to the waterworks.

55:07.095 --> 55:10.181
Oh, lighten up, Socks. Determination
is a mark of a good reporter.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.363
Chuck!

55:28.000 --> 55:29.100
Come on!

55:32.079 --> 55:33.196
Down!

55:33.247 --> 55:34.113
- Go!
- Chuck!

55:36.166 --> 55:37.250
Up, up!

55:55.561 --> 55:56.700
Chuck!

56:15.247 --> 56:16.497
Get out of here!

56:43.233 --> 56:44.650
I can't hold it.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.951
Let's go for the other chamber. Come on!

56:59.833 --> 57:01.500
Find something to jam the wheel.

57:02.836 --> 57:04.828
- Where shall I put it?
- Here, here.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.172
Brace it on the table.

57:12.763 --> 57:13.721
Let's get out of here.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.224
What happened?

57:25.275 --> 57:26.359
I don't know.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.194
What the hell are you doing
in there, anyway?

57:30.489 --> 57:32.023
Come on out of there.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.566
Is it safe?

57:33.617 --> 57:36.360
You haven't died and gone to heaven,
have you? Yeah, it's safe.

57:36.411 --> 57:37.870
You can ckick them in the butt,
they won't do nothing.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.705
Come on!

57:52.678 --> 57:54.670
Listen, I don't know how we can thak you.

57:54.721 --> 57:55.796
Just hurry up. We'll do fine.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.798
Ther'll be a whole damn army
of iron here in a minute.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.101
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.200
Check the white chamber.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.036
You come with me.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.231
Okay, we're safe now.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.392
They won't search down here?

58:49.443 --> 58:51.018
No, no. No iron ever comes down here.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.061
It's too wet for them.

58:52.112 --> 58:53.813
Screws up their circuits.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.648
We had a fire once,
the sprinklers went off.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.274
You should've seen them robots.

58:57.325 --> 58:59.368
They were standing around
like a bunch of drunks.

59:03.165 --> 59:04.657
There's the power plant right up there.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.242
You can go back the way you got here.

59:06.293 --> 59:08.327
Listen, I would really like to talk to you.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.662
I got nothing to say.

59:09.713 --> 59:10.705
Well, we're reporters, see.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.623
Yeah, I know who you are.
I've been watching you.

59:12.674 --> 59:13.883
Well, what's your name?

59:15.135 --> 59:16.168
Harry Croft.

59:16.219 --> 59:19.422
Well, Mr. Croft, you're just the kind
of man we've been looking for.

59:19.473 --> 59:21.215
Someone who knows their way
around this place

59:21.266 --> 59:22.383
and is not afraid to talk about it.

59:22.434 --> 59:24.176
Now, wait a minute, I did you a favor,

59:24.227 --> 59:26.262
because I don't like to see
anybody get into trouble.

59:26.313 --> 59:27.805
But I got nothing to talk about.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.057
Well, do you know who Miss Ballard is,
Mr. Croft?

59:30.108 --> 59:31.434
She's a reporter, right?

59:31.485 --> 59:33.019
Oh, hell, she's much more than a reporter.

59:33.070 --> 59:35.479
She's a top television commentator.

59:35.530 --> 59:39.316
She has her own show
with 55 million viewers worldwide.

59:39.367 --> 59:42.403
Now, she wants to inerview you
for her program, right?

59:42.454 --> 59:44.246
Yes, yes, I do.

59:44.706 --> 59:45.998
What, me?

59:47.542 --> 59:51.420
Well... I was here since the opening.

59:51.797 --> 59:54.832
The first one, way, way back.
And I've seen it all.

59:54.883 --> 59:58.691
That's it. Harry Croft, the man
behind the iron mask at Delos.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.921
- Yes.
- Would they see this in Cleveland?

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.264
They certainly will.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:04.433
My mother's in Cleveland.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.061
Hell, man, your mother's
going to be proud of you.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:09.980
I don't know.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.545
All right.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:23.911
Nobody here, sir.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.413
All right, come with me.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.551
I got a room up top, but...

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.254
me and Clark, we like
our little corner here best of all.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.798
Ths is Clark.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:45.700
Clark!

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.636
Well, hello, Clark.

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:51.355
He's an old 400 series
I saved from the junkyard.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:55.142
You want some coffee? Booze?

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:56.852
Coffee would be wonderful.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.229
What kind of booze do you have?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.189
Any kind you want, long as it's gin.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.232
Terrific.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:02.566
Come on, sit down,
make yourselves comfortable.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.819
- Okay.
- Give me a coffee and a couple of gins.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.445
And don't forget the ice.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.571
You got to stay on top of him.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:08.906
He gets a little sloppy sometimes.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.116
Why do you call him Clark?

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:14.128
You know, from Superman,
Clark Kent, man of steel.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.831
Is this his face?

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:21.669
Yeah... I kind of got tired of taking it off
every time I had to fix him.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.837
He don't mind.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.389
Oh, it's a sad face.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.217
Well, he used to work at the Roman World.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:31.095
He was one of the original iron men
in all the orgies.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.721
He's seen a lot, Clark has.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.565
It's wonder he can still move at all.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.442
Thank you, Clark.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:40.487
Yeah, well, I imagine you've seen
some things yourself, Harry.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.282
Well, you know.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:47.286
You... develop a taste
for the iron after a while.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.913
It's good.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.074
I remember one night.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.910
Frenchy and I had a couple of girls
up here from the Westworld.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:59.039
ooh-wee, we blew a few fuses
that night, I'll tell you.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.374
You said Frenchy.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:02.168
Yeah, it's a guy that used to work here.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.302
Why? Do you know Frenchy?

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.347
May I ask what you are doing here
at this time of night?

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.891
Hi, there.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:19.351
Yes, we couldn't sleep, wandered around,

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.895
and found ourselves here.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.396
Not very likely.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.106
Are you calling the lady a liar?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:29.320
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Harry was
just telling us about the good old days.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.905
He would have done better to remember

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.364
that we do not encourage contact

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.450
between our employees and our guests.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.243
We're not your guests.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:37.912
We're reporters.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:39.496
You invited us here, remember?

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.249
So, you can save that line of crap
for your robots, mister.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.544
And Dr. Schneider, if we're not allowed
to interview anybody we want,

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.047
then I think that we just better
leave Delos right now.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.882
You can talk to anyone you wish.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.176
I merely request that you inform Mr. Duffy

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.095
and not sneak around
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:56.597
Surely, that's not too much to ask.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.724
Listen, I was just leaving anyway.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.351
No, that's all right, Harry. It's late.

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.603
And I think that we're the ones
that ought to be going.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.571
If you follow me, I'll see you to your rooms.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:09.660
- Chuck?
- Right.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.071
Thanks, Harry, We'll see you.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.247
Yeah, okay.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.922
Clark, give me another gin.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:26.502
What'd I tell you?

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:27.836
It never changes.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.639
You get mixed up with people,
all you got's trouble.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:36.679
Good night.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.188
Thanks for everything, Doc.
It's been a swell evening.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:42.851
Mister, if this was your idea of a swell
evening, you have got the wrong girl.

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:45.312
No, I don't, and one of these days
you're going to be a hell of a reporter.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.563
- What did I do?
- Come with me.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.240
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Come on.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.570
Harry spoke of a Frenchy, remember?

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:54.770
Yeah.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.409
Well, this guy called Frenchy got himself
killed trying to tell me about Delos.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.785
Now, I never got the story.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:02.496
But he was carrying these clippings
about heavyweight people

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:03.747
from every country on Earth.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:06.050
You know, bankers and commissars,
you name it.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.335
I don't get the connection.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.712
Well, I checked.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.348
And each one of them
was a guest at Delos.

01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:14.508
Now, I smell a big rat.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:17.761
But I want to talk to Harry alone
and I'm going to need your help, Socks.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.179
Oh, listen I don't know.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:20.723
I mean, we keep breaking their rules,

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.100
they're never going to let me back
with a video crew.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.686
Anyway, we promised
that we would be fair.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:28.272
Okay, you help me tomorrow.

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.399
and if I don't get something solid from Harry,

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.484
then I'll lay off, all right?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.370
Okay, okay.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.114
Hey, you were pretty terrific tonight,
do you know that?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:40.576
Oh, you weren't too shabby yoursef.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.494
I bet you say that to all your copy boys.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.662
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.047
I don't.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.806
Shuttle 10-4-3 is clear to proceed to Mars...

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.389
Please, expedite repair of the fountain.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.725
4-2-7, do you copy?

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:08.436
We can see the fountain, and it is
not functioning in its proper mode.

01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:09.772
Do you copy?

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.899
4-2-7, please respond.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.150
<i>Yes, I copy, you miseralbe bag of bolts!</i>

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.650
If you think you can do any better,
get your iron butt down here,

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.572
otherwise, shut up!

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.499
4-2-7, out.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.583
We call it our Inner Space Chamber

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.794
and we hope to make it
a regular part of Futureworld.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.588
The idea is to actually make
a videotape of a dream.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:37.257
You take it with you, play it back,
find out what you're thinking about.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:39.134
That is absolutely incredible.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.769
- You want to try it?
- Go ahead, Socks, go for it.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.473
Well, yes, yes, I do, you know.
Maybe I could use it on the program.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.475
I think you'll find this a unique experience.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:48.185
- Chuck, would you just wait here?
- You bet.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:49.361
I gotta see this.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.189
Wait a minute, you mean he can watch?

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Unless you object.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.151
Well, I don't know whether I do or not.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:57.694
I mean, it depends on what I dream,
doesn't it?

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.581
Well, don't you worry about it.
I won't tell anybody.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.075
All right, wise guy.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.127
It's about time you learned
something about women.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.005
- This way.
- Hmm.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.005
Are you sure I won't have a nightmare?

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.799
I mean, this thing looks pretty frightening.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.476
Well, we'll see to it that that doesn't happen.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:24.688
The couch is designed to remove any
pressure along the neural spinal column.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:28.434
And the material bleeds air at the
exact tempreature of your body.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.145
So, you'll see nothing,
feel nothing, hear nothing.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.230
Your mind will begin to feed on itself.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.732
With my luck, I won't be able to fall asleep.

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:38.494
Bye.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:46.367
Every thought, like every eye blink
or a heartbeat

01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:48.745
releases currents of electricity,

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:51.173
which can be transformed into waves.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.375
She's got a lot on her mind, huh?

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.669
Well, we're recording 2,000 different waves

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.880
from 5,000 separate brain locations.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.382
- Wow.
- Millions of bits of information.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:01.425
We take it all in...

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:03.685
and put it back together.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:05.804
On this.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:06.939
- What's this?
- Take a look.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.202
You know what you're seeing?

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:21.862
I can't believe it.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.280
Well, it's true.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:24.915
You're looking directly into her mind.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.493
We've learned how to convert thought waves

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.586
back into the images the mind creates.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.663
It isn't perfect, of course.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.216
It'll do. Wow.

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.302
Activate the pain-pleasure gradient, please.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.106
Who's that?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.233
- Reference?
- A fantasy lover.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.727
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.612
Start a video recording on my mark.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:01.952
3, 2, 1, mark.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.491
We're losing it. She's waking up.

01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:14.279
Better give her a moment.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.907
Real life is a shock after that.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.250
Yeah, I'll bet.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:40.388
I call.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:41.398
What'd you got?

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:45.852
I said I'll call.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.021
Damn it, show me your cards!

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.656
I'll be go to hell.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:53.910
All right, what'd you got?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:13.763
Four kings, huh?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.977
I find out you been cheating,
I'm gonna fry your wires.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:25.392
All rght, it's my deal.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.643
Five cards stud.

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:29.729
Jokers with aces, straights, and flushes.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.073
Fool around, cheat this time.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.868
All right, ante up!

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.617
All right, you just stay away, mister.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.369
I'm in all the trouble I need because of you.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.587
Is that Frenchy?

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.583
My God, what happened to him?

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.051
Somebody killed him.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.795
I don't know why they'd want to do that.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.338
He never hurt anybody.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:56.723
What was his job?

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.301
He's a workman, same as I am.

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:02.721
He had a run-in with Dr. Schneider
and he quit.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.223
Or else he got fired, I don't know.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.275
He talked to me just before he was killed.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:10.070
He said he had the big story about Delos.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.114
Do you know what he was talking about?

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.902
- Do you?
- Maybe.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.244
Well, what?

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.288
Do you think they'll treat you any better?

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:23.416
Hmm?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.124
I'm probably going to lose my job,
because of this.

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:34.294
But I don't look like I got much
of a future anyway.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.879
Come on.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.097
I got something to show you.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.146
Don't you touch them cards.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.199
You know there used to be
a couple dozen maintenance men.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.825
In each world.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:09.329
Now it's all machines except for me
and a couple other guys.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.332
Everything changed
after they brought out the 700s.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:13.541
Changed how?

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.168
They're just different, that's all.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.836
They think too much.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.213
They don't think for themselves, do they?

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.256
No, no, they're iron just like the rest of them.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.009
They don't go anywhere, do anything
they're not programmed to.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.886
- But...
- But they got you worried, huh?

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.980
- This is it.
- All right.

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.113
What is it?

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.656
Used to be dead inventory.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.991
I don't know what it is now.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.786
I know one thing. That's the only door
in Delos I can't get in.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:52.505
The only ones allowed in there are the 700s.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.507
What's that?

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.723
Write down what I tell you.

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:15.311
7, 4, 3,

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.239
1, 6.

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.327
7, 4, 3, 1, 6.

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.752
Let's try it.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:41.337
Yeah, I've tried it a dozen times.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.256
I can't get in thoose doors.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.133
Hell, one more time, Harry.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:47.393
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:07.831
Give me those numbers.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:13.620
7, 4, 3,

01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:15.964
1, 6.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.847
I told you.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:50.573
- You...?
- No, I don't smoke.

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.575
I tried that code every way I could.

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.577
I can't get in, just can't get in.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.496
Well, maybe it's not the code, you know?

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.123
Maybe it's something else,
something personal.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.374
What do you mean?

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.251
Fingerprints or voice, you know?

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.586
700s haven't got no fingerprints.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:06.306
Only way you can tell the difference
between them is in their eyes.

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.469
That's it! Goddamn it, that's it!

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.512
Their eyes.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.181
That light reads the circuitry in their eyes.

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.191
Come on!

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:20.170
Well, I hope you'll accept
my apologies for Chuck's behavior.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:23.857
I think he's just overtrained
for a simple story like Delos.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:26.317
Well, we're not worried. I'm sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.060
You know, I find that man, Harry,
an interesting character.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.905
I definitely want to use him on the show.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.574
- Harry's one of our old boys.
- Ah.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.950
Mr. Duffy feels sorry for him,

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:36.119
but frankly, I think he should have
been phased out long ago.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:37.328
Well, why's that?

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.539
His skills are no longer needed.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.124
Our 700s can do it better.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:42.709
Oh, Mort, that's not entirely true.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.419
We haven't solved the problem of wet areas.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.920
Harry is still quite valuable.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:48.756
Well, anyway, don't you think it's dangerous
to rely too much on the robots?

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.508
Don't you think something
could go wrong again?

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.060
Not at all.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.108
Hey, iron ass!

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.520
Are you running correlates
on organic emissions?

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:42.318
I have the resonance frequency
on the protein molecules.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.939
Electromagnetic shaping positive.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.315
Subject beta-niner.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:50.028
Energy matrix play out is particulating...

01:19:50.766 --> 01:19:51.828
now.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:35.848
It's all right.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.229
Do you know what it is?

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.189
Wasn't here before.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.287
It's Karnovski.

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:35.009
Chuck, isn't that...?

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:36.928
It's Takaguchi.

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:56.364
Oh, my God, I don't beleive it.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.480
- They're duplicates.
- What?

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:40.483
They are creating and programming
duplicates of real people.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.985
That's what Frenchy's list
meant about the politicians

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:44.862
and the commissars and the generals.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.648
They've all been replaced by those things.

01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:50.960
You'll start the family history program
on my mark.

01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:55.631
3, 2, 1, mark.

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:04.966
Let us repeat our social
attitude program, please.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:07.560
And add a factor of 5 to the medulla circuit.

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:11.764
You will never harm Delos.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.649
I will never harm Delos.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:19.063
You will do what Delos instructs you to do.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:22.858
I will do whatever Delos instructs me to do.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:24.902
<i>You will destroy your original.</i>

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.455
I will destroy my original.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:29.740
There's a plane leaving in about 3 hours.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.701
We should get back to our rooms,
get our stuff together,

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:32.743
and get on that flight.

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.954
- Yeah, but what about Duffy?
- We'll call him from the airport.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:36.622
- You know your way back from here?
- You bet.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:37.873
I wouldn't stay in that room too long.

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:39.166
I don't beleve it's safe.

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.043
I'll meet you at the power plant
in half an hour.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.004
I know a place we can hide
until the plane leaves.

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.506
Okay, but if we don't show,
you get out best way you can.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.391
- Good luck.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:51.679
I'll just be a minute.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.314
All right, I'll try to get Holcombe,
tell him what happened.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.478
Operator, I want to make
a person-to-person call

01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:01.397
to Arthur Holcombe,

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:03.699
International Media Corporation.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.736
Right, 7-2-5,

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.988
4-5-7,

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:13.284
8-8-6-9-6.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:14.744
Yeah, sure, I'll wait.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.462
Put the phone down, Chuck.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:24.629
You're a part of it?

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.847
Yes, of couse, I am.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.300
Now, where is Miss Ballard?

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.727
She's with Harry.

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:34.180
They're supposed to meet me here.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.098
Well, I suppose it's possible that ocasionally

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:37.858
even a newspaper reporter tells the truth.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.152
We'll just go upstairs and check, shall we?

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:48.911
Why are you doing this?

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:51.364
Oh, that should be obvious.

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:53.324
If you read your own newspaper
more carefully,

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.959
you'd understand our position quite easily.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:26:58.329
The human being is a very unstable,

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.500
irrational,

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.382
violent animal.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.135
Now, hold it.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:09.965
All our probability studies
indicate that if left alone,

01:27:10.016 --> 01:27:12.510
you'll destroy much of this planet
before the end of the decade.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.687
Now, we at Delos are determined
to seeing that doesn't happen.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:24.188
We don't intend to be destroyed
by your mistakes.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:27.400
So, you're replacing human leaders
with your own duplicates, huh?

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:31.612
Yes. With duplicates who are programmed
to think first of the welfare of Delos

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:33.155
and to accept our instructions.

01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:34.665
Downstairs.

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:42.790
Why bother with Tracy or me?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.000
Because we need the favorable publicity

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:47.094
to attract the top rank of human leadership.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.505
The stories your duplicates create

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:53.058
will guarantee that every Chief of State
will soon be among our guests.

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.722
You can't possibly succeed.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.765
We can and we will.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:04.061
Look, don't imagine that these duplicates
we've created are mere robots.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.896
They are not machines.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:08.107
They are living beings

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:11.152
produced by the genetic information
in your own cells.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:13.112
There are no mechanical parts.

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:15.114
Even those of us who create them

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:17.208
can't tell the original from the duplicate.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:25.800
Jesus!

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:38.846
Shoot him!

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:40.306
Shoot him! I can't hold him!

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.608
Now!

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.568
What are you doing?

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:36.620
He was much too strong.

01:30:12.157 --> 01:30:13.232
What do we do now?

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:16.243
Well, we can't stay here.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.414
What about Westworld?
That was deserted.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.001
Yeah, good idea.

01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:31.175
You know I'd take you with me, don't you?

01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:32.877
You know that.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.587
It just... It wouldn't work out.

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.131
I mean, people on the outside, they just...

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.134
they never would understand
how it is with us.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:43.304
The hell with them.

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:44.930
When we get this thing straightened out,

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:47.316
I'll be back to get you.
Don't worry about that.

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:48.984
Don't worry about it.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.372
You been a good pal to me.

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:03.332
I'm gonna sure miss you.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.461
Watch out for the bad circuit
in your arm, you hear?

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:10.422
You got to be careful now.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:16.720
So long, you ol' bag of bolts.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:19.431
We'll see you.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:46.709
Okay.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:49.244
You wait by the barn.

01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:50.537
I'm going to get Harry and be right back.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:51.914
Okay, look.

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:54.216
- You be careful.
- You bet.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.552
- Go on.
- Yeah.

01:32:08.064 --> 01:32:09.473
- Hi.
- Where is Tracy?

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.191
- She's safe.
- Great, let's go.

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:42.589
Don't hurry, Chuck.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.932
I'll find you.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:57.654
Chuck? Chuck?

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:11.160
Hello, Tracy.

01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:19.384
Why! Well, you... You can't be.

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:21.428
But I am.

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.891
What are you?

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:29.019
You.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:33.107
Don't run there.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:36.935
You were going to run to the saloon

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:39.855
and hide in the gap between
the floorboard and the ground.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:43.067
How can... How can you know that?

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.319
Because I have your mind.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.122
And what you think, I think
and what you know, I know.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.741
And now it's too late to run,

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:53.627
because we're both within
accurate range of these guns.

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:56.789
Yes, I... Yes, I just... I just thought of that.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.582
Yes, I know you did.

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:01.301
It's a good thing Father taught us
how to shoot, isn't it?

01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:03.170
Yes.

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:06.473
Maybe we shouldn't have worried so much
about whether he loved us or not.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:11.353
No... He was just busy, I guess.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.105
Yes.

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:16.892
Well, it's been good to meet you.

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:18.227
But of course...

01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:19.570
there can only be one of us.

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:23.107
- Yes.
- And since...

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.442
since you can read my mind.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.244
I can read yours.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.371
Yes.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.174
Hey, Chuck?

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.678
Chuck, this isn't going to get us
anywhere, you know?

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:18.563
We're both lousy shots.

01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:21.350
Remember Sergeant Rucker at basic?

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:26.000
Browning, you couldn't hit an elephant
in the ass at 5 yards with a bazooka.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.314
Be careful, brother.

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:02.941
Don't forget we're afraid of heights.

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:12.821
Oh, good.

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.615
Damn good, really.

01:40:24.101 --> 01:40:25.844
Well, Chuck, it's been fun.

01:40:25.895 --> 01:40:28.054
But I've got a plane to catch
and a story to write.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:29.139
You know what I mean?

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:30.815
Anyway, don't feel too bad.

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.518
You're not going to die, exactly.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.403
Just going to be replaced.

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:43.982
I thought I'd see you off personally.

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:45.942
Thank you.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:49.070
It's just been a fabulous time, really.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:52.365
I look forward to coming back
with a video crew next week.

01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:55.118
Really, it was just a wonderful time.

01:42:55.169 --> 01:42:57.412
And I hope you'll thank Mr. Duffy for us.

01:42:57.463 --> 01:42:58.672
I certainly will.

01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:01.291
What about you, Chuck?

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:04.377
Have we satisfied your suspicions?

01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:06.421
I'd like to apologize for that.

01:43:06.472 --> 01:43:08.932
But I think your patience with me
will be rewarded.

01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:11.384
I intend to write a story that will make

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:14.721
everyone who can afford it,
a Delos customer.

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.015
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:43:16.066 --> 01:43:18.350
- That's wonderful.
- <i>Laker Airways anounces the departure</i>

01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:21.102
<i>of flight 936 for New York</i>

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:22.445
- Wonderful.
- <i>and San Fransico.</i>

01:43:22.905 --> 01:43:24.522
<i>This is the final call for...</i>

01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:26.149
Oh, that's us.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.026
- Let's go.
- So long, Doc.

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:29.569
<i>All aboard, please.</i>

01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:09.159
They are the... the wrong ones.

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:27.877
Did you talk to Arthur?

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.796
Yeah, told him the whole story.

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:31.548
It'll be old news by the time we get home.

01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:34.634
Hey, you know, I still don't think
that kissing you

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:37.637
was a very scientific way
of finding out who was who.

01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:40.231
Well, there are some things
you just can't fake, Socks.
