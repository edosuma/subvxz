Mmm, my, that smells good.

01:01.761 --> 01:04.696
Mm-hmm.
No, ma, don't open it.
It'll fall.

01:04.763 --> 01:07.866
Oh. You know,
this is the first time...

01:07.933 --> 01:10.869
That I've made
something different
for Sunday breakfast...

01:10.936 --> 01:13.705
Since before
I got married.

01:13.773 --> 01:17.876
How does it feel
being creative again ?
Oh, good, I guess.

01:17.943 --> 01:21.880
But I don't know.
I think your father's gonna
feel like a Guinea pig.

01:21.947 --> 01:24.482
And I'm not so sure
he'll like it.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.484
He'll have to accept it.

01:26.552 --> 01:28.787
That's what
women's liberation
is all about.

01:28.854 --> 01:34.125
You're an individual, too,
and you have to be free
to do your own thing.

01:34.193 --> 01:37.562
I suppose.
Gee, I've enjoyed
this, ma.

01:37.629 --> 01:39.731
Working with you
and talking.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.901
Why, this is the first
real heart-to-heart
we've had maybe ever.

01:42.968 --> 01:44.903
That's right.

01:44.970 --> 01:49.107
It's been really great
'cause we've been
talking like friends.

01:49.175 --> 01:53.277
Yeah, we worked ourselves up
from mother and daughter.

01:53.345 --> 01:55.413
Oh, ma,
that's lovely.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.582
You know what's nice, ma ?

01:57.649 --> 02:00.451
I've told you things today
I never ever told anybody...

02:00.519 --> 02:02.486
Except my very best
girlfriends.

02:02.554 --> 02:06.091
Really ?
Yeah.

02:06.158 --> 02:08.092
Gloria, come here.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.095
Sit down.

02:10.162 --> 02:13.932
Yeah, ma ? You got
some intimate girl stuff
you're gonna share with me ?

02:13.999 --> 02:18.036
Well, nothing that I'd write
to dear Abby about.

02:18.104 --> 02:22.107
Do you know that once
I kissed a boy...

02:22.174 --> 02:26.111
For 11 and a half minutes
nonstop ?

02:27.279 --> 02:30.849
- Mother, no.
- It was a contest.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.885
His name was
Scott flenderhook.

02:33.953 --> 02:37.122
Oh, we-- we could have gone
for 15 minutes,

02:37.189 --> 02:39.891
only he had one bucktooth.

02:41.426 --> 02:46.464
I got a shootin' pain
from my upper lip
to my right temple.

02:46.531 --> 02:49.433
Well, did you win
the contest ?
Oh, yeah.

02:49.501 --> 02:52.036
The only couple
that came close...

02:52.104 --> 02:56.641
Was Lucy shinado
and Melvin pransky.

02:56.708 --> 03:00.311
Lucy had spaghetti for dinner,
with butter and garlic.

03:00.379 --> 03:05.483
<i>So after nine minutes,</i>
<i>they had to pull 'em apart.</i>

03:06.718 --> 03:10.354
You know, because Melvin
was turning green.

03:10.422 --> 03:14.725
That's a funny story, ma.
I'm glad you shared it
with me.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.162
Who's sharin' what
with who ?
Good morning, Archie.

03:17.229 --> 03:19.831
Morning, daddy.
Ma just told me
the funniest story--

03:19.899 --> 03:21.900
about how we met !

03:24.236 --> 03:29.007
You remember, Archie.
It was in the puritan may
coffee shop.

03:29.074 --> 03:32.143
Oh, yeah,
you was with that guy
flenderhook...

03:32.211 --> 03:34.578
With the bicuspid
out to there.

03:36.548 --> 03:40.418
Kissin' him must have been
like kissin' a nail.

03:40.485 --> 03:43.188
Though you swore to me
you never done it.

03:43.255 --> 03:45.356
[ Sniffs ]
What you got in here ?

03:45.424 --> 03:48.526
Daddy, no !
What the hell
is in there ?

03:48.593 --> 03:50.695
You'll see.
[ Timer bell dings ]

03:50.762 --> 03:54.265
Oh, it's done.
We can take it out now.
Just wait, Archie.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.535
You're gonna like it.
It's your breakfast.

03:57.602 --> 04:00.438
Bacon souffle !

04:00.505 --> 04:04.542
I ain't gonna eat
none of that.

04:04.609 --> 04:07.846
What happened to
my eggs over easy
and my crispy bacon ?

04:07.913 --> 04:12.383
Well, Gloria and I
were talking about
creative cooking,

04:12.451 --> 04:15.987
and she found this recipe
right on the egg carton.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.988
See ?

04:18.057 --> 04:21.492
"A cheerful change
from the humdrum
morning fare."

04:25.130 --> 04:28.532
You're a pip,
you know that ?

04:28.600 --> 04:30.902
What day of the week
is this ?
Sunday.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.738
What do I have for breakfast
every Sunday of my life,
Edith ?

04:33.805 --> 04:36.574
[ Sighs ]
Prune juice,
just six ounces;

04:36.641 --> 04:38.910
eggs over easy,
drain the grease;

04:38.978 --> 04:40.912
bacon crispy,
drain the grease;

04:40.980 --> 04:43.748
toast, three slices,
buttered lightly;
And coffee.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.385
Mountain-grown.
Right.

04:50.289 --> 04:54.125
And I don't need
no cheerful change from
the humdrum morning fare...

04:54.193 --> 04:56.127
You just "emunerated."

04:56.195 --> 04:59.163
Give me a regular
Archie bunker breakfast.
That's all I want.

04:59.231 --> 05:01.499
Eggs over here,
bacon over there.

05:01.566 --> 05:04.102
You can send that souffle
back to Charles de gaulle.

05:04.169 --> 05:06.470
Daddy,
Charles de gaulle's dead.

05:06.538 --> 05:10.674
That's right.
And I need a souffle
about as much as he does.

05:12.511 --> 05:16.614
Boy, oh, boy,
a woman sure has no chance
to express herself around you.

05:16.681 --> 05:18.616
It's as if
she were in prison.

05:18.683 --> 05:21.852
She can't grow, can't change.
She's second-class,
half a person.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.789
Hold it there,
little girl.

05:24.856 --> 05:27.858
Them ain't your words.
Where are you getting
all that from ?

05:27.927 --> 05:32.363
Oh, Gloria has been reading
a book about women's lib.

05:32.431 --> 05:34.632
Oh, jeez.

05:34.699 --> 05:37.701
Three books, daddy,
and I didn't read them,
I devoured them.

05:37.769 --> 05:41.472
Not only that,
I had Michael read them too.
Mike ?

05:41.540 --> 05:43.808
It ain't enough that he's
a pinko and an atheist.

05:43.875 --> 05:47.145
You're gonna
turn him from a man
into a "morphodite."

05:48.347 --> 05:50.415
What's a "morphodite" ?

05:50.482 --> 05:54.085
A freak with
a little too much of each
and not enough of neither.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.291
Michael isn't like you,
daddy.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.293
He's open-minded
and flexible.

06:02.361 --> 06:05.063
He recognizes--
and you better recognize too--

06:05.130 --> 06:07.832
that women are individuals,
your wife is an individual.

06:07.899 --> 06:11.502
She's entitled
to the same rights
and privileges as you.

06:11.570 --> 06:14.238
Edith, are you listening
to this over here ?

06:14.306 --> 06:17.241
A dreaded disease
is "infilterating"
our home,

06:17.309 --> 06:19.610
and your daughter's
bringing it in here.

06:19.678 --> 06:24.015
Next she'll have you
prancing around in hot pants
and burning your brassieres.

06:28.387 --> 06:32.256
Oh, no, Archie.
I'm afraid of fire.

06:35.861 --> 06:40.164
Even when I was a little girl,
I couldn't toast marshmallows.

06:40.232 --> 06:42.367
I heard the story,
so get off it.

06:42.434 --> 06:45.103
Somebody else had to
put it in the fire.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.338
Stifle that, will you !
And then I would
pick it off the twig.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.340
Will you stifle that !

06:49.408 --> 06:52.443
Daddy, you just stop that
and let mother do her thing.

06:52.511 --> 06:55.113
I'm waiting for her
to do her thing,

06:55.180 --> 06:59.450
and her thing on a Sunday
morning is eggs over easy
and crispy bacon.

06:59.518 --> 07:02.720
And drainin' the grease off.
I'll fix it for you
right away, Archie.

07:02.787 --> 07:04.722
Please !
Mother, no !

07:04.789 --> 07:07.358
"Mother, no" ?
What is she doing
anyway ?

07:07.426 --> 07:09.894
Submitting to him,
that's what she's doing.

07:09.961 --> 07:13.097
Submitting to
her king, her ruler,
her lord and master.

07:13.165 --> 07:17.168
Gee, I couldn't have
said that better myself.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.470
You're into that
women's lib thing, huh ?

07:19.538 --> 07:21.972
We was into it,
and now we're out of it.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.410
Will you tell your wife
to stop putting fancy ideas
into her mother's head...

07:25.477 --> 07:27.412
'Cause they don't
belong there.

07:27.479 --> 07:30.281
It's like puttin' lace
on a bowlin' ball.

07:30.349 --> 07:34.718
Mother, how can you just
lie down and be stepped on
this way ?

07:34.786 --> 07:37.255
Well, I'm not lying down.

07:37.322 --> 07:39.924
And I don't feel like
I'm being stepped on.

07:39.991 --> 07:43.727
I'll get your eggs, Archie.
You see what you're
doing to her ?

07:43.795 --> 07:47.831
You're choking her spirit,
her entire personality.

07:47.899 --> 07:50.868
Here's a woman
who will never ever realize
her full potential,

07:50.936 --> 07:52.937
and it's all because
of you, daddy.

07:53.004 --> 07:54.939
I just wanna eat.

07:55.006 --> 07:57.975
Tell him, Michael.
Tell him what he's
doing to her.

07:58.043 --> 07:59.977
It's none of my business.

08:00.045 --> 08:02.947
The oppressed blacks
are your business.

08:03.014 --> 08:05.783
Discrimination
against puerto ricans
and Jews and poles...

08:05.850 --> 08:08.119
And every other minority
is your business.

08:08.187 --> 08:12.690
- What about discrimination
against women ?
- It's not the same thing.

08:12.757 --> 08:16.060
How can you say that ?
You read the books.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.430
Yes, I read the books,
but that doesn't mean
I buy the whole bag.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.433
Yes, I believe women
should have equal
job opportunities.

08:22.501 --> 08:26.604
Yes, I believe they
should have equal pay.
You better believe in it.

08:26.671 --> 08:30.108
But I don't believe in a woman
opening up her big mouth
around the house.

08:30.175 --> 08:33.177
So shut up, will you !
Like hell I will !

08:33.245 --> 08:35.179
Gloria bunker !

08:35.246 --> 08:37.681
Her name's not bunker.
It's stivic.

08:39.551 --> 08:42.186
Don't be swearing
around the house,
Gloria bunker.

08:42.254 --> 08:45.756
- Her name's Gloria stivic.
- Whatever.

08:45.824 --> 08:50.161
Oughta be ashamed of herself,
swearing around the house,
and in front of her mother,

08:50.229 --> 08:53.364
and on a Sunday morning,
and, Edith, I'm hungry !

08:53.432 --> 08:56.501
I think you ought
to be ashamed.

08:56.568 --> 09:00.471
You and my husband,
who I thought I knew,
and now I see I don't.

09:00.539 --> 09:05.009
I'm gonna tell you something
about my mother and me.
You do not own us.

09:05.076 --> 09:07.845
We are free and equal
human beings...

09:07.912 --> 09:10.681
Who represent
half the population
of this earth,

09:10.749 --> 09:12.683
the female population.

09:12.751 --> 09:15.419
And we're tired
of being exploited by men,

09:15.487 --> 09:18.689
tired of you holding us down
and then keeping us back.

09:18.757 --> 09:21.025
If you continue
to exploit us,

09:21.092 --> 09:23.528
we're gonna rise up
against you someday...

09:23.595 --> 09:26.197
Like our black sisters
and our chicano sisters...

09:26.265 --> 09:28.199
And all the other
oppressed sisters !

09:28.267 --> 09:32.303
I don't know what I'm
saying anymore, but you men
better believe it !

ruined this way.

I've never seen her
get like that.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.409
What time of the month
is it ?

10:14.213 --> 10:16.814
No, it ain't that,
Archie.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.283
She's really upset.

10:28.993 --> 10:31.495
That was quite a scene
you put on down there.

10:31.563 --> 10:33.931
It's not funny, Michael.

10:33.998 --> 10:37.602
I may not be able to
express it well, but you know
what women's lib means to me.

10:37.669 --> 10:39.670
How could you say
those things to me
down there ?

10:39.738 --> 10:43.774
Because you know how upset
I've been all weekend
about my grades.

10:43.842 --> 10:46.444
I'm uptight about them.
They're coming
in tomorrow's mail.

10:46.511 --> 10:48.479
My whole scholarship
depends on them.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.282
We're talking about me
and my problems now.

10:51.350 --> 10:55.119
Why can't you see
how much this means to me ?

10:55.186 --> 10:57.521
Uh, look, Gloria,
I'm sorry.

10:57.589 --> 10:59.957
I'm just a little nervous,
that's all.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.826
But you know how I feel
about equality
between the sexes.

11:02.894 --> 11:05.963
I'm not sure anymore.
How do you feel ?

11:06.030 --> 11:09.199
I believe in total equality
between man and woman.

11:09.268 --> 11:12.970
But that equality
can only come about
when the female partner...

11:13.037 --> 11:16.206
Is willing to confess
her total inferiority.

11:21.813 --> 11:25.483
I'm your equal as soon
as I admit to you...

11:25.550 --> 11:28.886
That I'm totally
inferior ?
Yes.

11:28.953 --> 11:31.822
You're insane, Michael !
You're out of your head !
Wait a second.

11:31.890 --> 11:36.059
Gloria, you're upset because
you forgot I don't really
think women are inferior.

11:36.127 --> 11:39.730
It's just a game,
a game dictated by nature.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.333
Didn't I ever explain this
to you before ?

11:42.401 --> 11:44.702
Sit down, I'll explain it
to you again.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.338
You, the woman,
come to me, the man,

11:47.406 --> 11:51.008
and you admit that
you're weaker, more needful
and you're inferior.

11:51.075 --> 11:54.011
Oh, no !
The minute you admit to me
that you're inferior,

11:54.078 --> 11:56.013
my maleness
is satisfied,

11:56.080 --> 11:59.016
I can immediately
elevate you to a level
of complete equality.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.018
But, Michael--
wait a second.

12:01.085 --> 12:03.688
Don't you see that you
gotta let me, the male,
make the decision ?

12:03.755 --> 12:07.458
Then we're forever equal,
and the question doesn't
have to come up again.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.528
Don't you remember me
explaining this to you ?

12:10.595 --> 12:13.364
My male-female
game plan.

12:13.432 --> 12:18.135
Oh, yeah, yeah, that.
I remember that now.

12:18.203 --> 12:22.005
That was the night
of our engagement party.
Right. There you go.

12:22.073 --> 12:26.009
You found a bottle of wine,
and after everyone was gone,

12:26.077 --> 12:29.012
we sat on the floor
in front of a gooseneck lamp,

12:29.080 --> 12:31.549
pretending it
was a fireplace.
Oh, yeah.

12:31.616 --> 12:35.720
We're sober now, Michael,
and we're older.

12:35.787 --> 12:39.623
And I do not want
to say I'm inferior.
That is dumb.

12:40.992 --> 12:42.960
That is not dumb !

12:43.027 --> 12:46.731
That is the essence
of the whole male-female
relationship.

12:46.798 --> 12:49.500
Then I suppose
I'm too dumb to see it.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.903
You said it, not me.
You don't take me seriously.

12:52.971 --> 12:56.707
Why should you ?
We women, we're nothing
but sex objects.

12:56.775 --> 12:59.243
What's wrong with that ?
Michael !

12:59.310 --> 13:03.213
I should be that lucky !

13:03.281 --> 13:06.417
One more dumb joke,
and I'm leaving you.
You understand that ?

13:06.485 --> 13:08.886
I'm leaving you
on the next dumb joke.

13:08.953 --> 13:11.188
You would do that,
wouldn't you ?

13:11.256 --> 13:13.657
Knowing how uptight I am
about my grades,

13:13.725 --> 13:16.560
knowing that my whole
future depends on it,
you would do that.

13:16.628 --> 13:19.363
You did it again.
We're back to you
and your problem.

13:19.431 --> 13:22.366
That's right,
because my problem involves
our whole future together.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.870
It's more important
than yours !
Because I'm only a woman.

13:25.937 --> 13:29.907
That's the way men feel--
your problems are always
greater than ours.

13:29.974 --> 13:32.109
Well ?

13:32.176 --> 13:37.815
And the declaration
of independence says
we're all created equal.

13:37.883 --> 13:42.219
Ha !
It says all <i>men</i>
<i>are created equal.</i>

13:45.690 --> 13:49.159
The declaration
of independence
says nothing about women !

13:49.227 --> 13:51.729

as I mean to you,

13:51.797 --> 13:54.465

as you're gonna take me--

13:54.533 --> 13:56.967

What does it
look like I'm doing ?

Fine !

maybe she'll teach him a lesson
and throw him outta here.

You can't mean that.
You're acting
like a child !

14:31.402 --> 14:35.172
You're acting irrationally.
Why can't we talk about this
like rational people ?

What is the suitcase for ?

14:38.643 --> 14:41.512

just as much for you
as I am for myself.

Wait a second.
[ Edith ]
Where are you going ?

14:43.582 --> 14:45.683
If anybody wants me,
I'll be at Trudy's.

14:45.750 --> 14:49.019
You leave this house
while I am uptight
about my grades,

14:49.087 --> 14:52.189

you hear me ?

14:52.256 --> 14:55.593
Wait a minute, meathead.
It's her house !

14:58.663 --> 15:00.631
I don't want to
come back,

15:00.699 --> 15:03.901
not till you
learn to treat me
as an equal partner.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.303
You want to be treated
as a partner ?

15:06.371 --> 15:10.641
Then why don't you act
like a partner and not some
silly little windup doll ?

15:10.709 --> 15:14.879
Windup doll, huh ?
Is that the way
you think of me ?

15:14.946 --> 15:17.381
Well, if that's what
you think of me,

15:17.448 --> 15:21.351
then this is your little
windup doll saying,
"over and out !"

15:38.469 --> 15:42.239
Well, Edith,
it looks like we
lost a daughter...

15:44.308 --> 15:46.577
But we gained
a meathead.

15:56.988 --> 15:59.757

Do you have to do that, ma ?

bad enough already ?

16:03.628 --> 16:07.364
Look how sorry he is.
He's eating his food
and Gloria's too.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.770
I told you,
when I'm nervous, I eat.

16:14.005 --> 16:16.106
I'm nervous
about the grades.

They're coming in the morning.
My whole scholarship
depends on it.

His wife leaves him,
and all he can think
about's his grades.

That's not all I'm
thinking about, Archie.

16:29.353 --> 16:33.958
I love Gloria very much.
It's because I love her that
I'm worried about my grades.

Because it means
our future together.

He's eatin' like
he's gonna be hung.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.869
Let me ask you something,
Sonny boy.

16:45.937 --> 16:49.306
Suppose Gloria stays away
for two, maybe three months.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.642
What do you figure to do ?

16:51.710 --> 16:54.645

at one of her girlfriend's.

at her house,

a home of your own,
you'll be king.

was to call me Edith.

When you're not there
to share something with me,
I don't experience it.

what that means ?

each other, if we can't feel
anything without each other,
