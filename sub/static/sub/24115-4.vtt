WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:03.360
<i>Nyssa here has yet</i>

00:03.480 --> 00:04.550
to be paired with someone.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.996
As my youngest daughter,
you'll be binding with her.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.793
What's she like,
Nyssa-Vex?

00:08.960 --> 00:09.757
She's interesting.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.957
Council's scheduled
my binding to Dev.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.671
Black Zero's leadership
hierarchy.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.559
- Who's he?
- Unknown.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.840
Intelligence suggests he's
a relatively new player.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.674
Seems to be rising up through
the ranks very quickly.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.509
We've detected Black Zero
activity in this area.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.512
There are thousands
of innocent citizens

00:26.680 --> 00:27.680
<i>in this sector.</i>

00:27.920 --> 00:30.230
- We have our orders.
- I know, but we can't...

00:30.400 --> 00:32.517
We don't choose which
orders we follow.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.840
We're still assessing the
nature of the threat, Primus.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.390
- Your job is to neutralize.
- Negative, Primus.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.597
You are disobeying
a direct order.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.936
- What happened here?
- She murdered him.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.314
It was self-defense.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.216
The only arrest made in
the Rankless Initiative.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.594
One of our own Sagitari.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.376
What are you going to tell
the voice of Rao?

00:50.400 --> 00:51.595
The mission is a failure.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.916
Rhom is my friend.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.080
<i>She's been taken over by
Brainiac's nanotechnology.</i>

00:55.120 --> 00:56.760
<i>What if we could find
a way to disable it?</i>

00:57.560 --> 01:00.439
She's still alive.
The counsel need to see her.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.040
I can't.
I have to save her.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.316
<i>Brainiac is coming for us.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:06.951
Your world is at an end.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.520
She's here.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.873
You kept me waiting.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.394
Apologies, Your Eminence.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.118
Anda, you are to begin
preparations

01:35.320 --> 01:37.676
for the Nova Cycle celebration.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Nova Cycle?

01:39.080 --> 01:40.514
But it's not for weeks.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.797
It is Rao's will that
His Reverence begin

01:42.960 --> 01:45.475
the Nova Cycle today.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.837
The military's failed
initiative has created

01:50.040 --> 01:51.394
much unrest.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.394
The faith of the Rankless
has been shaken.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.834
The Nova Cycle celebrations
will begin today.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.159
I'll start preparing
immediately.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.358
We shall walk amongst
the Rankless and show them

02:05.560 --> 02:09.315
how the light of Rao
can heal all wounds.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.757
Today we will spread
the word of Rao.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.671
Today Kandor will be reborn.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.240
Stand aside, Sagitari.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
What squad are you with?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.710
That's none of your concern.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.473
Hey, you can't go in there.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.632
This communication hub
is restricted.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.640
You, stop!

03:12.600 --> 03:13.920
Stand down!

03:14.720 --> 03:16.234
I need to check
with my commanding...

03:19.240 --> 03:21.550
Hub's clear.
Commander?

03:27.120 --> 03:28.120
Get to work.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.675
Grandfather,
her vitals are falling.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.274
Well,
as far as my readings show,

03:39.440 --> 03:41.511
Rhom's in no pain,
but there's nothing more

03:41.680 --> 03:42.875
we can do for her medically.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.551
The alien technology
Brainiac used is...

03:45.720 --> 03:48.235
It's not like anything
I've seen before.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.955
How long does she have?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.432
A matter of hours, possibly.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.794
Rhom has a daughter.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.636
Ona.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.958
Then Kem and I should be
the ones to tell her.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
Commander Zod,

04:20.360 --> 04:22.431
you're to report to
intelligence for review.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.432
That seems fast for
the After-Action panel.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.829
The action's barely ended.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.912
You disobeyed a direct order.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.395
I protected my squad.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.153
Three of your squad are dead,
Lyta.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.674
I know that better
than anyone,

04:32.840 --> 04:34.069
but the rest of them are alive

04:34.240 --> 04:35.256
because of my actions
down there.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.396
Save it for the review.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.711
Get changed.
You follow Dev-Em.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.510
Lyta, command is about more
than making tough calls.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.155
It's about being able
to answer for them too.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.232
I've tried so hard
to teach you this,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.915
but you've continually
refused to listen.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.995
All these years,
all your lessons...

04:54.360 --> 04:57.319
I never wanted your help.
I wanted a mother.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.120
You know,
I always wanted a droid.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.550
A real sassy one like R2-D2.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.235
I gotta say Hologram
Granddaddy's pretty sweet.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.080
It'd be better if he could
hold things, fetch beers.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.113
And, you know,
more of a personality.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
Like me.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.960
Adam.

05:22.080 --> 05:22.911
Did you see that?

05:24.880 --> 05:25.880
What?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.080
Okay,
I swear we're being followed.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
I've got a visual.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.112
Hey.
Didn't think I'd see you

05:47.320 --> 05:48.913
before you went in.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.957
Listen, about last night,
what I did...

05:52.160 --> 05:53.560
You followed orders, Dev.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.836
None of this is your fault.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.554
I'm... I'm okay.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.837
You're a good Sagitari, Lyta.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.736
Proved yesterday you were
an even better commander.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.114
I told them that.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.040
Thanks for always
having my back.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.474
If you don't know by now,

06:08.040 --> 06:09.838
it's more than loyalty, Lyta.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.989
Commander Zod!

06:26.520 --> 06:28.751
It's the voice.
Why is he here?

06:28.920 --> 06:31.674
Come to inspect damage,
I guess.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.593
Where was His Grace
last night?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.513
Look who decided to show up.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.296
Haven't they done enough
already?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.073
We should return
to the Guilds.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.789
Tyrant!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.440
Shame on you!

06:56.640 --> 06:58.950
- Rao's wrath find you!
- This isn't Rao's way!

07:04.160 --> 07:07.995
It is clear to the Voice of
Rao Sagitari abuse their power.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.119
No matter the guild, rank,
title, or name,

07:11.320 --> 07:13.880
those who wronged you will
be met with swift justice

07:14.040 --> 07:15.360
before the Nova Cycle.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.318
It is the word of Rao.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
Your Eminence.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.152
We must assuage
the discontent

07:29.320 --> 07:30.470
amongst the Rankless.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.833
I need someone to take
responsibility

07:33.000 --> 07:35.469
for the military's failures
before I return

07:35.680 --> 07:37.034
to begin the ceremony.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.200
Of course.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.640
Who do you have in mind?

07:40.600 --> 07:43.877
Someone of high authority.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.669
Your refusal, Commander Zod,

07:47.840 --> 07:49.680
to carry out your Primus' order
led to the loss

07:49.760 --> 07:53.720
of vital intel and the escape
of Black Zero operatives.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.918
Circumstances changed beyond
leadership's knowledge.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.516
Rankless unrest created
unexpected variables

07:59.680 --> 08:01.433
dire to the safety
of my squad.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.037
And I'm to understand similar
variables lead to the deaths

08:05.200 --> 08:07.157
of three of your squad,
correct?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.792
- Yes.
- Tell us about that.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.553
Start with the
questionable arrest

08:11.760 --> 08:13.160
of Sagitari Kol-Da.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.994
She murdered an unarmed
Rankless citizen.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.597
You never even witnessed
the citizen's death, did you?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.719
No, I did not.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.873
I'm just trying
to understand.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.594
A man was dead.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.399
Handcuffed and unarmed.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.155
This caused the Rankless
to become volatile.

08:33.559 --> 08:37.270
So what this panel needs to
understand is arresting Kol-Da

08:37.440 --> 08:38.794
prevented a riot,

08:38.960 --> 08:40.837
which would have endangered
every Sagitari

08:41.039 --> 08:42.474
in this initiative...

08:42.640 --> 08:44.950
Which last I counted was more
than three men,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.396
so as I have nothing
left to say,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.836
I would like to return
to my squad for duty.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.719
I'm afraid you
can't do that yet.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.360
This is a military review.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.477
It's not the Tribunal's
jurisdiction.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.831
New evidence has emerged
that changes that.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.837
Commander Zod,
it is by Rao's word

09:01.000 --> 09:03.037
that you are hereby charged
with treason

09:03.240 --> 09:06.039
for conspiring with Black Zero.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.316
Take her away.

09:16.360 --> 09:20.240
I just served her r'antha
eggs and ran away.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.153
I can't even look at her.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.715
I know, mate.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.360
But we have to tell her.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.840
I'll never forget the day
Mama Zed sat me down

09:29.040 --> 09:29.712
and told me.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.358
It was like life came
crashing down, you know?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.237
You know, maybe we should
talk to Mama Zed.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.039
She'll know how to handle this.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.196
I dunno.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.115
You all right, buddy?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.636
Yeah, I'm, uh,
just gonna do my rounds.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.192
I'm gonna go think
about smoking.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.910
Hi, Ona.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.271
Is Uncle Kem sad
that Mom's sick?

10:21.800 --> 10:22.631
Oh, your Uncle Kem?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.554
Um, no.
Uh...

10:25.720 --> 10:29.475
It's okay, Seg.
Mom's going to be fine.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.036
I've been praying for her.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.073
You ought to go.
I'll talk to Ona.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.119
Kem?
What's going on now?

10:40.320 --> 10:42.551
- Talk to me.
- The regulars...

10:42.720 --> 10:44.951
The regulars are saying
the Voice came down.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.835
Promise justice for the man
the Sagitari killed

10:48.040 --> 10:49.679
in last night's shit storm.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.435
Seg, the Word of Rao just
announced who's responsible.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.960
It's Lyta.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.830
She's been arrested.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.838
Back off.
I need to speak to Lyta-Zod.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.560
Area's restricted,
Rankless.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.473
I'm not Rankless anymore.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.320
And I'm not looking
for trouble.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.119
I know what you're
looking for.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.552
Tell me why you need
to see Lyta.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.473
Do you really wanna
do this now?

11:21.240 --> 11:23.311
I want to hear you say it.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.676
I don't think you do.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.669
I know you're upset,
but none of this helps Lyta.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.238
Go now.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.953
I will only say this once.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.032
Stay away from Lyta.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.352
Or what?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.876
You gonna add another El
to your kill list?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.360
Or maybe just arrest me
like you did your own daughter?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.040
I had nothing
to do with this.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.976
I suppose you could do
nothing to stop it, either!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.560
She's charged with treason,
you shit!

11:56.720 --> 11:58.040
By the Voice of Rao himself.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.795
Lyta's fate is out
of my control.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.160
What's gonna happen to her?

12:04.240 --> 12:07.438
She'll be executed,
just like your grandfather was.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.080
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.471
I believe you are the reason
it is happening,

12:11.640 --> 12:12.994
so don't come back here.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.039
Nyssa, you have a visitor.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.429
Open.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.516
Which one?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
The gold one.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.760
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.752
Uh... no.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
Yes.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.471
- I need your help.
- With what?

12:59.280 --> 13:02.000
Getting charges of treason
dropped against Lyta-Zod.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.230
We have to help her.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.198
Lyta-Zod's a traitor.
That's...

13:05.360 --> 13:08.080
Untrue.
She's being set up.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.357
To take the fall
for the Rankless initiative.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.592
Why would you care
about a Zod?

13:13.520 --> 13:15.512
Jayna killed my parents,
not Lyta.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.080
She had nothing to do with it.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.560
And she doesn't deserve to die
for a crime she didn't commit.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.392
You can do better than that.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.480
Why do you want
to save Lyta-Zod?

13:25.640 --> 13:27.393
It's true.
Okay?

13:27.600 --> 13:28.750
We're old friends.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.470
Really?

13:31.400 --> 13:35.189
You, former Rankless
and her a Sagitari...

13:35.560 --> 13:37.677
Also daughter of Primus Zod.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.833
Sorry.
I don't buy it.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.713
Why do you want
to save Lyta-Zod?

13:42.920 --> 13:43.990
Because I love her.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.160
I love her.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.830
And I can't lose her.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.920
Was that so hard?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.674
You knew.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.280
I suspected.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.596
You confirmed it.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.520
Now we can move forward.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.359
Since the Voice of Rao
took control,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.318
no execution has been stayed.
I...

14:15.480 --> 14:16.311
Nyssa.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.719
No games.
Will you help her?

14:25.920 --> 14:28.355
<i>I was questioning suspects
when a Rankless man</i>

14:28.520 --> 14:32.150
<i>ran at me yelling,
"Begin again at Zero."</i>

14:32.320 --> 14:33.470
<i>I defended myself.</i>

14:33.680 --> 14:36.115
<i>By the time Commander Zod
found me,</i>

14:36.560 --> 14:39.632
<i>I'd examined the body and saw
what looked to be a body bomb.</i>

14:39.800 --> 14:41.598
<i>Guy nearly blew us all away.</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:43.558
<i>You saved a lot of lives.</i>

14:43.720 --> 14:45.598
<i>Commander Zod didn't
see it that way.</i>

14:45.840 --> 14:48.150
<i>She arrested me and pissed off
the Rankless</i>

14:48.360 --> 14:50.716
<i>by saying I killed
an innocent man.</i>

14:51.280 --> 14:52.999
Made no sense.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.710
The autopsy confirmed
the body bomb,

14:56.240 --> 14:59.199
proving Lyta's testimony
to be false.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.438
And her refusal
to enact your order

15:03.880 --> 15:07.794
is further evidence that Lyta
is clearly aligned

15:07.960 --> 15:09.030
with Black Zero.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.320
I'm sorry.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.951
That is some bullshit.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.709
What are you gonna do?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.896
Set a plan in motion,
but I need a sure way to prove

15:29.920 --> 15:31.070
Lyta's innocence.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.193
Well, I talked to Val
and after a very graphic

15:34.360 --> 15:36.272
biology lesson,
he told me that Rhom's

15:36.440 --> 15:37.736
not doing so well,
so it looks like

15:37.760 --> 15:38.816
we are running out of time.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.880
We need to get back there.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.515
Absolutely.
It looks like she's

15:41.680 --> 15:42.976
- our best shot...
- I'm gonna give Rhom

15:43.000 --> 15:44.878
- to the Council.
- Whoa, what?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.474
They have to see
what was really

15:46.640 --> 15:47.720
in that communications hub.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.320
It's the only way
to clear Lyta's name.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.880
You're gonna get
yourself executed.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.896
And you're gonna give up our
only lead against Brainiac.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.880
If Krypton is destroyed,
saving Lyta won't matter.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.509
A Krypton without Lyta
isn't worth saving.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.320
All right, all right,
all right, listen.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
Uh...

16:05.440 --> 16:06.440
You stay.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.351
See what you can do for Lyta.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.696
I'm gonna go to the Fortress
and see if...

16:08.720 --> 16:10.680
- We don't have time, mate.
- Just stop it, you...

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
I have to do this, Adam.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.430
Val, I'm headed your way.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.320
Do you read me?

17:05.839 --> 17:08.150
If you're going to glare at
me with disappointment,

17:08.400 --> 17:09.595
you can leave.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.795
I came here to help.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.559
I thought you weren't
doing that anymore.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.757
You are many things, Lyta.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.559
But you're my daughter,

17:23.720 --> 17:25.598
and you are a Zod.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.516
And Zods are not traitors.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.519
You don't deserve death.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.996
You believe me?

17:32.160 --> 17:34.311
I believe you're here
for the wrong reasons.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.996
Whatever those reasons are,
I believe they involve Seg.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.998
I think you're here
protecting him.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.953
It's more complicated
than that.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.550
No, Lyta.
Give up Seg and end this.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.076
Even if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.960
If you want to help me,
then for once in your life,

17:50.160 --> 17:50.798
trust me.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.595
Trust runs both ways, Lyta!

17:54.560 --> 17:57.553
Please tell me what
this is about.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.896
Primus,
you should clear the room now.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.280
I need to speak with
your daughter.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.152
I'm her advocate
in this matter.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.595
Oh, great.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.872
Hey.
Hey, what is this?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.396
Hmm?
Where am I?

18:42.280 --> 18:43.714
Oh, not the gloves.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.600
No good is gonna come
from putting those on.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.315
Shut up.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.440
Hey.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.910
Hey, what is that?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.240
Hey, what are you gonna
do with that?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.036
No, wait, stop.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.317
No!

19:32.200 --> 19:34.795
You can drop
the impartial act.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.555
I know you only work to serve
your father's political agenda.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.359
My father didn't
send me here.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.076
Seg did.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.950
- Do you know where he is?
- I haven't seen him.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.391
Well, I mean,
since he left my place.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.759
He hasn't been here?

19:52.960 --> 19:55.156
So you know about me and Seg?

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
I do.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.235
Does Dev-Em?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.392
Save your threats.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.155
The execution you don't stop
will have me out of your way

20:06.320 --> 20:07.390
soon enough.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.639
I don't need to remove you.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.160
Seg and I are already
guaranteed a future.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.560
We have a child.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.553
His name is Cor-Vex.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.511
Well, thanks for coming.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.275
I think I'll take my chances
with the executioner's blade.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.477
If you don't want my help,
that's your call.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.075
But you are embroiled
in a political witch hunt

20:30.240 --> 20:32.232
led by the Voice
of Rao himself.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.119
And as the Chief Magistrate's
daughter

20:34.280 --> 20:35.999
and an accomplished lawmaker,

20:36.160 --> 20:40.518
I am your best hope of escaping
this ordeal unscathed.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.469
I urge you to have
some faith in me.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.957
After all, Seg does.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.429
What do you need to know?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.440
Let's start with discrepancies.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.077
Tell me about Kol-Da.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.670
That's enough.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.360
What was that thing?

21:31.560 --> 21:32.755
What did you do to me?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.277
Nothing to cause
permanent damage.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.631
If you're going to torture me,
asshole,

21:37.800 --> 21:39.234
at least ask me some questions.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.035
You endured a test,
not torture.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.634
Oh, a test.
Good.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.950
Thanks for explaining.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.793
I feel so much
less tortured now.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.280
Hmm.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.160
The Outlands creature we use
is quite rare.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.516
It has the ability
to nest in the mind

21:57.680 --> 22:01.469
and upset the very nature
of any man.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.597
What it doesn't work on
are Sentries.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.190
Now that I know
you are not one,

22:08.440 --> 22:10.796
tell me what you know
about Brainiac.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.078
How do you know
about Brainiac?

22:20.520 --> 22:21.715
Who are you?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.595
I didn't bring you here
to ask me questions.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
I have my own.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.960
And I need
to get out of here.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.395
Someone's life is at stake.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.950
Your life is at stake.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.560
You gonna kill me?

22:32.720 --> 22:34.279
I prefer not.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.116
And I've ordered my men not to
harm you unless I say so.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.271
Your fate is in your own hands.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.437
The faster you help us, Seg,

22:46.600 --> 22:49.320
the faster you can help the
friend you spoke of.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.437
I don't do deals
with terrorists.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.440
Sagitari... as much as I dislike
them...

22:53.640 --> 22:55.921
don't tend to kidnap people,
so those uniforms are stolen.

22:56.080 --> 22:59.676
And judging by this stronghold,

22:59.920 --> 23:02.754
I'd wager that
you're Black Zero.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.710
If Black Zero knew
about Brainiac,

23:16.880 --> 23:18.576
do you think they'd be wasting
time battling that

23:18.600 --> 23:21.991
six-faced liar and his
unraveling theocracy?

23:22.280 --> 23:23.430
So you're on your own?

23:23.720 --> 23:26.792
Black Zero initially provided
me with some manpower.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.919
And some very useful resources.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.675
But my men follow my orders.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.399
And my orders serve Kandor.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.351
Of course they do.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.496
You know, I'd hate to be you
when Black Zero find out

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
they're being used.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.473
Black Zero is of no concern.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.040
Krypton's survival is.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.554
And to protect it from Brainiac,

23:45.720 --> 23:48.360
I need to know what
his sentry was doing

23:48.560 --> 23:50.279
in that communications hub.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.071
She was uploading
data to Brainiac.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.160
We tried to stop her,
but she was too far along.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.955
I thought we had more time.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.479
After it uploaded the data,

24:01.640 --> 24:02.437
what happened to the Sentry?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.136
Did you destroy it,
or did it go dormant?

24:04.160 --> 24:05.880
Hey, that it is a she,
and her name is Rhom.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.696
And I'm not answering any more
of your questions, and you...

24:07.720 --> 24:09.279
Is it still alive?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.432
I don't give up my friends.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.109
That Sentry's
not your friend.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.192
Not anymore,
and if it is alive,

24:15.360 --> 24:17.033
then it didn't
complete its mission.

24:17.200 --> 24:17.997
No, I told you.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.480
She uploaded the data
to Brainiac.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.960
That was just a part of it.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.153
A Sentry will seek to infect
a more useful, powerful host,

24:24.320 --> 24:26.073
after which it's disconnected
and shut down.

24:26.240 --> 24:29.074
If I can tear it open,
access its memory nodes...

24:29.240 --> 24:31.596
Hey, no one's tearing anyone
open, you son of a bitch.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
She's still alive.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.910
Don't disrespect
the commander.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.556
Thank you, Tak.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.196
But...

24:44.680 --> 24:48.435
No one touches Seg
unless I say.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.157
You know, I never see you
without that thing.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.720
It must be special.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.520
It was Mom's,
but she gave it to me.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.431
Ah.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.037
Oh, best to keep away from
that scoundrel, sweetheart.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.429
Scoundrel?

25:13.600 --> 25:15.080
All right, well,
that is a fair point.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.318
Oh.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.712
Ona, this...
This is Mama Zed.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.151
Mama Zed raised
your Uncle Kem.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.757
He's not my real uncle.
I just call him that.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.110
Oh, that's all right.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.714
I'm not his mama.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.673
But I still think of him
as family.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.314
Well, that makes us sort of
like family, too, then, hmm?

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
Tell you what.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.719
Why don't you have this,
and sit down,

25:42.920 --> 25:44.912
and I'll make you my specialty?

25:45.160 --> 25:46.160
Okay.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.800
You haven't told her?

25:58.640 --> 25:59.640
No.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.919
What if she doesn't find
happiness again?

26:09.080 --> 26:10.116
What if she...

26:11.760 --> 26:13.274
What if she ends up like me?

26:16.560 --> 26:20.713
You tell Ona,
"Never give up hope."

26:29.040 --> 26:33.398
Mama Zed is the best cook
on Krypton.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.515
Ona, can we talk?

26:44.680 --> 26:47.718
My mama's not coming home,
is she?

26:49.240 --> 26:50.993
No, sweetheart, she's not.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.593
I'm so, so sorry.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.154
We did everything
that we could.

27:05.040 --> 27:05.871
But you know what?

27:08.520 --> 27:10.751
You are gonna be fine.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.878
You know why?
'Cause I'm gonna look after you.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.033
And I am never gonna
let anything

27:18.200 --> 27:19.839
bad happen to you ever.
I swear.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.798
Are we still going
to Nova Cycle?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.231
I need to do something
for my mom.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.755
I'm sure we can manage that.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.874
How could you be so stupid?

27:54.080 --> 27:54.877
What in the name of Rao...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.151
What did you offer Kol-Da
to lie for you?

27:57.360 --> 27:58.157
Her freedom, I'm guessing.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.396
Keep your voice down.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.880
Lyta told me her story.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.394
She's innocent.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.914
You manipulated everything.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.080
You believe her?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.670
- She's a traitor.
- She's a Zod.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.150
Their house is built
from honor.

28:10.320 --> 28:11.470
Unlike ours.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.400
Well, what does it matter?

28:13.840 --> 28:15.672
True or not,
Lyta's fate is out

28:15.880 --> 28:17.075
of my control.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.594
You have the power
to stop this.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.473
My hands are tied.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.976
The Voice of Rao demanded a
scapegoat for that miserable

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Rankless initiative.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.190
What was I to do?

28:25.360 --> 28:26.555
Defy his order?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.160
So you picked
Jayna's daughter?

28:28.320 --> 28:29.549
The voice demanded
an officer.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.996
Someone from a noble house.
A Zod.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.117
Our plans rest
on Jayna's military...

28:34.280 --> 28:36.033
Oh, you think
I don't know that?

28:36.200 --> 28:37.920
I've been working years
to incur the loyalty

28:38.040 --> 28:39.040
of the Guilds' elite.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.840
Preparing to approach Jayna
for her support.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.793
Have you any idea what it takes
to influence a Zod?

28:43.960 --> 28:45.952
Then don't let the Voice
unravel everything

28:46.160 --> 28:47.416
- we have worked to...
- I have been doing this

28:47.440 --> 28:49.159
to protect everything!

28:52.200 --> 28:54.112
It was finally aligning.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.953
Seg was even starting
to trust me.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.952
Well, that can still stand.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.191
Seg has nothing
to do with Lyta.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.999
He's in love with her.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
He told me.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.990
The Rankless hold House El
in high regard.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.560
Seg can unite Kandor.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.996
We need him and Jayna.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.197
But the moment Lyta dies,
so does our chance

29:15.360 --> 29:17.033
to overthrow the Voice of Rao.

29:19.360 --> 29:23.593
I refuse to lie down and let
the Voice retain his power.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.879
- I am not afraid of him.
- Well, you should be.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.317
Unless you wish to see the
Voice of Rao's wrath yourself,

29:30.480 --> 29:32.278
Lyta must die.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.119
So this is what you do.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.350
Just kill anyone you think
is in your way.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.560
No.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.270
I kill who I know
is in my way.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.511
Our existence is at stake,
and if you fail

30:08.680 --> 30:09.909
to understand that,

30:10.080 --> 30:12.640
then you are just another
idealistic El

30:12.800 --> 30:16.077
without the stones to effect
real change.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.915
Another?

30:21.160 --> 30:23.231
You knew my grandfather?

30:24.960 --> 30:29.000
My history with your family
is complicated.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.830
But it doesn't have to be
that way any longer.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.759
The choice is simple, Seg.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.237
You help me find that sentry,
and together

30:37.640 --> 30:40.633
we can protect the future
of Krypton.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.553
Well, that sounds good
in theory.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.189
But I have no way of knowing
if you're gonna keep your word.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.680
You're right.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.635
How can I prove
that I am honorable?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.631
Breaking a prisoner out of
Fort Rozz would be a start.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
Very well.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.000
We will help you,

30:58.960 --> 31:01.395
and you will help us
find that Sentry.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.896
Honor your word,
and I will lead you

31:02.920 --> 31:04.240
to Rhom's location myself.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.840
I'll prepare my men.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.149
History will remember
your decision, Seg.

31:32.200 --> 31:32.838
There!

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, the Offerings Altar?

31:34.120 --> 31:36.760
My mom and I make an offering
every cycle to Rao.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.320
It's tradition.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.199
The Voice has to have it

31:40.440 --> 31:43.399
to help mom find
her way to Rao.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.989
Then we'll do it together.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.800
Come on.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.036
Sorry.
Excuse me.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.554
Um, can...
Oh, okay.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.040
Good chat.

32:09.360 --> 32:14.230
I think getting near to Voice
of Rao is a very bad idea.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.632
Ona?
Ona?

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
Ona?

32:26.640 --> 32:27.312
Ona!

32:27.480 --> 32:28.880
Ona, just stay there, okay?

32:43.800 --> 32:45.553
Wait, Ona, stop!
Ona, come back!

32:46.080 --> 32:48.016
Please, please, please!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:48.040 --> 32:49.880
Please, please, please,
don't hurt her, please.

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
She just want...

32:51.680 --> 32:53.751
Ona just wanted to see you.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.216
She wanted to give
you an offering

32:55.240 --> 32:56.640
on behalf of her mother.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.077
She loves Rao more than anyone
I have ever met.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.991
And on this day in particular,
she's mourning her mother.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.435
So, please.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.559
Please just show
her some kindness.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.355
Show her that...

33:12.400 --> 33:14.198
Show her that Rao loves her,
too.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.430
Show everyone.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.194
As your mother's light fades,

33:36.720 --> 33:40.350
may she find Rao's
in the higher plane

33:40.640 --> 33:43.155
and be reborn
a servant unto him.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.559
As her daughter
will on Krypton.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.559
Let her faith serve as example.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.919
Look upon her as my disciple.

33:57.080 --> 34:01.359
For she will be given rank
and serve as a novice.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.193
Word of Rao.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.313
What do you think,
Uncle Kem?

34:15.480 --> 34:17.312
I think that you
look so happy.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.110
Your mother is gonna
be so proud.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.672
Thank you.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.714
Seg?
Seg?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.159
Val, where is he?

34:50.239 --> 34:51.469
I haven't seen him.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.359
Although he did try
to communicate briefly

34:53.520 --> 34:55.239
before his comm lost signal.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.831
Mr. Strange,
you should see this.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.038
Please, Mr. Strange
was my dad.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.551
And also what we called the kid
in gym class who licked feet.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.997
Call me Doctor.
No, better make it Adam.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.913
- Adam...
- Have you really not seen him?

35:11.080 --> 35:15.040
Adam, my Nubots have found
a way to Rhom's cortex.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.640
If they find a way in,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.275
we can sift through updates
Rhom sent.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.390
What the hell was that?

35:22.560 --> 35:23.920
The cerebellum has
just been struck

35:24.080 --> 35:25.309
by an immense surge of power.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.594
Ona.
Where's Ona?

35:32.760 --> 35:34.433
She's okay.
She's with Kem.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.958
No, no.
You have to stop Ona.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.120
What?

35:40.480 --> 35:41.800
Hey, hey!

35:47.800 --> 35:49.678
Rhom, stop her from what?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.030
What does that mean?

35:51.800 --> 35:54.440
The Nubots are flushing
themselves from Rhom's system.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.353
Her link with Brainiac
has been severed.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
So she's gone?

36:12.240 --> 36:13.240
Okay.

36:13.880 --> 36:14.880
We gotta tell Seg.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.834
If we can find him.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.429
Commander is ready for you.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.231
So, you been doing the stoic
Black Zero thing long?

36:24.400 --> 36:26.198
Or just trying it out?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.034
That's a good way
to lose a finger.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.235
Your daughter is the

38:03.400 --> 38:04.675
first ever Zod

38:04.880 --> 38:06.473
to be labeled a traitor.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.639
I can't imagine how that feels.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.440
Leave before I remove you.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.673
I know you hate my father.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.673
But I've come to make
you an offer

38:18.840 --> 38:20.479
that could save Lyta's life.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.074
For the cost of what?

38:22.560 --> 38:24.074
My soul?

38:24.560 --> 38:25.914
Loyalty.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.118
Pledge your support
for my father.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.915
Help us take back Kandor
for the people

38:31.120 --> 38:32.600
and overthrow
the Voice of Rao.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.151
You speak of treason while
my daughter dies for it.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.199
I should kill you.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.751
If you do,
Lyta's fate is sealed.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.440
But if you join us,
we'll have the strength

38:44.600 --> 38:46.478
of your military
to enact the coup.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.475
Wrest power from the Voice
and release your daughter.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.037
One tyrant for another.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.159
My father can unite
the Guilds and the Rankless.

38:56.320 --> 38:59.552
We can create a golden age
for Kandor run by its people.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.275
With himself at the helm.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.354
There's always a catch
with House Vex.

39:05.520 --> 39:09.116
You ask me to betray my oath
to the state,

39:09.440 --> 39:13.480
to dishonor my name and what it
stood for since Krypton began.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.632
How much is all that honor
worth to you

39:15.800 --> 39:18.793
if you sacrifice your family
to retain it?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.350
Think it over.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.240
I'll be waiting.

39:39.160 --> 39:39.911
This is your Commander.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.958
Seg-El is somewhere
in the complex.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.595
Find him.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.831
Today marks the beginning
of our Nova Cycle...

39:46.000 --> 39:48.560
a celebration of birth
and rebirth.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.359
A celebration of Rao.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.876
We begin anew,
absolved of our sins

39:53.040 --> 39:54.360
from the prior cycle.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.080
- It is a day of faith.
- And justice.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.555
Let us pray to Rao.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.352
Holy Rao,
out of the endless void

40:28.560 --> 40:30.074
you kindled the sun.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.514
By your strength,

40:33.440 --> 40:35.079
<i>you gave us life.</i>

40:37.680 --> 40:40.832
<i>For your glory,
we offer our death.</i>

40:43.480 --> 40:47.076
<i>Today's the day we escape
the darkness of sin</i>

40:48.040 --> 40:50.555
<i>and renew our faith
by your light once more.</i>

40:52.800 --> 40:55.474
<i>Today is the day
we live again.</i>

40:56.000 --> 40:57.434
Today is Nova.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.200
Praise Rao.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.351
Praise Rao.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.917
Let the Nova Cycle begin.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.556
Ona!
