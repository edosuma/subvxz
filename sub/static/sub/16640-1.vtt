01:32.640 --> 01:34.790
This is the conveyor belt?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.751
Mind out.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.434
Wait, wait, wait.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.635
Balraj! Can you get
the other one?

01:44.680 --> 01:46.671
Can you check this one?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.153
I just did.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.879
This is mayhem.
This is like bedlam.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.638
Good, isn't it?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.837
What do you mean
it's a bit like New York?

02:02.880 --> 02:05.838
Better get used to it, Darcy.
We're here for two weeks.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.518
Jesus, Balraj, where the hell
have you brought me?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.755
Hurry up, you silly girls!

02:38.800 --> 02:43.157
We must make sure Jaya meets this
Mr. Balraj from London before anyone else.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.716
All mothers think that any single guy
with big bucks must be shopping for a wife.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.955
I'm embarrassed to say,
but I hope he is.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.511
What, shopping or loaded?

02:52.560 --> 02:54.278
Well, both.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.474
Lakhi, you think your mother
has gone crazy?

02:57.520 --> 02:59.431
That I am letting you wear that?

02:59.480 --> 03:02.153
I told you, Lakhi.
It's very vulgar.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.069
But, Mama. It's killing, Mama!

03:05.840 --> 03:09.116
Oh, if it's killing, it's what
everyone's wearing in Mumbai.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.835
But we want Balraj to look into
Jaya's eyes, not your mames.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.472
She's our only hope.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.636
If we do not get the
eldest married first,

03:16.680 --> 03:19.478
we'll never be able to marry
rest of you for the shame.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.113
Come on, Lakhi,
it's only a party.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.390
Save your fussing for
the big wedding tomorrow.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.271
Papa, just chill.
Let me fix my dupatta.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.231
Oh! Nameste.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.871
Chandra, make sure you smile.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.751
Now, sit back.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.031
- Hi, Lakhi.
- Hi.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.272
Hello, dear.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.754
- Can we sit here?
- Of course!

03:43.800 --> 03:46.872
- Mama, we'll go and see the bride.
- OK, come soon.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.229
- Chandra, don't be too long.
- OK.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.113
Oh, this must be the famous Balraj from UK.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.549
He's from the Uppal family
of Delhi, you know.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.034
Hey, Balraj, you made it in one piece
from London.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.433
Is that his name?

04:03.480 --> 04:06.631
I completely forgot
groom is bringing guest from England.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.591
Apparently, he's a barrister.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.797
Is that right? A barrister?

04:11.840 --> 04:14.912
And his family live in Windsor,
near the Queen's castle.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.235
Really? Next to the Queen?

04:17.279 --> 04:21.353
Oh, his sister is looking so lovely.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.311
So fair, nah?

04:23.360 --> 04:26.079
- Who's that Englishman with him?
- He's American.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.076
His name is William Darcy.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.714
He was Balraj's fast friend at Oxford.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.354
From one of the richest families in America.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.516
They own hotels all over the world.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.471
Shame he's not Indian, though.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.112
Sure you're OK about going away
to London? You only met him twice.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.116
He's nice and so is his family.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.597
You need to get out of this town, Lalita.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.551
You know there's nothing for you here.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.034
All the guys just want girls
from rich families.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.991
Papa needs me. I couldn't leave.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.076
His friend Balraj is great.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.196
He's looking for a girl too, you know.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.795
Good Lord, is it me, or is every woman
over 50 giving you the eye?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.279
Don't be dense, Darcy.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.472
Every mother in this room is wetting
her knickers for him for their daughters.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.909
- Can we leave yet?
- Kiran, I'm his best man.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.678
I can't just bail out on him, can I?

05:16.720 --> 05:19.314
It's 10am in New York.
I wouldn't mind getting back early

05:19.360 --> 05:21.874
so I can go through the financials
on that hotel in Goa.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.956
Will you stop working, just this once?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.911
And you stop being such a coconut.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.599
This is our dear, dear motherland. Enjoy it.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.313
The only thing India's good for
is losing weight.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.319
Are you sure this is safe to eat? I don't
want to get Delhi belly on my first day.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.272
- What's happening now?
- The Indian version of American Idol.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.912
I hope you've brought earplugs.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.555
This is where the girls tease the boys,
and the boys tease the girls.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.838
Brace yourself, Darcy.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.633
He's about to transform
into the Indian MC Hammer.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.358
What are they like?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.950
What are they singing?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.790
Oh, these pretty girls fluttering
temptingly like kites without string.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.636
These girls are like naked live wires.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.797
If you get too close,
you'll get an electric shock of love.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.108
Ooh!

08:21.760 --> 08:24.354
Oh, my gosh, she's beautiful!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.711
There's still time.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.591
That's fantastic. Thank you.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.871
Come and dance.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.831
You must be joking.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.751
The two of you, dance.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.354
Let go of me!

10:26.760 --> 10:28.671
Thank you.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.276
Darcy, what are you doing?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.708
- My drawstring keeps coming undone.
- Let's see.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.115
I don't know why
you made me wear these pants.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.435
Why don't we just alert the media?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.357
She's too outrageous.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.834
I'm telling you, she'll
give us all a bad name.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.952
You know she is spending
all night texting boys?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.558
Lakhi.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.556
Stop it now. Lakhi.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.795
Good evening, sir.
We're from the groom's side.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.876
We'd like to introduce ourselves, if we may.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.319
I'm Balraj.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.078
- This is my sister Kiran.
- Hi.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.634
- And my good friend William Darcy.
- Hello.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.274
Very nice to meet you all.
Er, I'm Chaman Bakshi.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.276
May I introduce my family to you?

11:13.320 --> 11:15.993
This is my wife, Mrs Manurma Rama Bakshi,

11:16.040 --> 11:20.113
and, er, these are my daughters:
Jaya, Lalita, that's Lakhi and that's Maya.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.755
Four daughters in one family!
God has blessed you four times over.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.156
Such a pleasure
to make your fine acquaintance.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.916
Would you do me the honour?

11:29.960 --> 11:30.995
Papa?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.110
Of course, of course. Please, please.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.752
Darcy, why don't you ask one of
Jaya's lovely sisters to dance as well?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.233
No.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.794
Um, I'm sorry. I can't.
I must get back and work.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.751
I have a conference call.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.233
But it's easier than you think.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.510
- I can show you.
- No, I really can't.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.835
Maybe another time.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.232
Rich American.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.238
What does he think -
we are not good enough for him?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.233
You should have seen Mrs Lamba's face.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.238
Balraj didn't dance with
any other girl all night.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.471
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist
my pretty Jaya's charms.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.509
Mama.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.073
Or yours, I'm sure.

12:20.120 --> 12:25.592
Just imagine - if Jaya went to live in UK,
we could visit her any time.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.835
I would hate to have
my daughters so far away.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.599
But we have so many.
One or two can go abroad.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.517
They'll earn more. God knows they need to,

12:32.560 --> 12:35.518
because we can't afford to give them
all decent dowries.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.438
Perhaps we should have drowned some
at the time of their birth.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.119
We wouldn't have had these problems
if we had gone to US.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.357
Did I tell you about this fellow
who went to America and made it rich?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.870
My brother did all the paperwork to
sponsor us, but you didn't want to leave.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.753
This fellow went to America
and bought a huge American house

12:50.800 --> 12:52.233
and built three swimming pools.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.919
Now he owns three Subway franchises
in New Jersey.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.632
And what do we have?

12:56.680 --> 13:00.070
An old house, an old farm, and new bills.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.317
So when his father visited from India,
he showed him around his mansion

13:03.360 --> 13:05.078
and three swimming pools.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.953
His father asked,
"But, son, why do you need three pools?"

13:08.000 --> 13:12.152
So he said proudly, "Well, one is filled
with cold water for when I feel hot.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.634
The second is filled with
hot water when I feel cold."

13:14.680 --> 13:17.752
The father nodded and said,
"But why is the third pool empty?"

13:17.800 --> 13:21.270
He said, "Well, that's when
I don't feel like swimming at all."

13:23.560 --> 13:25.232
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.835
Listen, Balraj, if you really
wanna get married,

13:31.880 --> 13:34.952
hook up with an Indian girl
from England, or even America.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.638
You'd have something in common.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.831
Look, I didn't have any problems
talking with Jaya, did I?

13:39.880 --> 13:42.952
She's intelligent, she's beautiful.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.479
Come on, Bal.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.238
Look around you.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.077
You said it yourself, man.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.792
We're in Hicksville India.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.436
Then why did I see you eyeing up Lalita?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.755
She's beautiful, yeah, but...

14:01.800 --> 14:05.634
But not your mum's idea
of the mother of her heirs, right?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.398
Not exactly, no.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.476
- Bye.
- Give me that bag.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.351
- Why?
- I want to go over there.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.356
- Come.
- Just give me the bag.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.550
# Is this going to be

14:17.600 --> 14:20.194
# The last time we three

14:20.680 --> 14:24.514
# Walk down this street together?

14:25.720 --> 14:28.314
# She's going to be wed

14:28.360 --> 14:30.476
# It doesn't mean she's dead

14:31.080 --> 14:35.517
# We'll be friends for ever

14:36.040 --> 14:38.713
# It's not long before the day

14:38.760 --> 14:41.354
# I up, up, up and fly away

14:41.400 --> 14:45.632
# So let's make this a walk to remember

14:47.080 --> 14:49.116
# There are stars in your way

14:49.160 --> 14:51.799
# From Amritsar to UK

14:51.840 --> 14:54.354
# There are stars in your way

14:54.400 --> 14:56.630
# From Amritsar to UK

14:57.440 --> 14:59.510
# You are the golden girl

14:59.560 --> 15:02.154
# The centre of the world

15:02.200 --> 15:04.919
# Just ask and you shall have it

15:04.960 --> 15:07.599
# This is your moment, grab it

15:07.640 --> 15:09.870
# Your wish is our command

15:09.920 --> 15:12.195
# We'll supply what you demand

15:12.680 --> 15:15.194
# You've turned their lives around

15:15.240 --> 15:17.834
# You got a marriage into town

15:23.640 --> 15:26.029
# A marriage has come to town

15:26.080 --> 15:28.548
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

15:28.640 --> 15:31.029
# Life is great, let's celebrate

15:31.080 --> 15:34.038
# The sacred union two souls have found

15:44.400 --> 15:47.949
# You see flowers are most important

15:49.320 --> 15:53.279
# Bright garlands can never be forgotten

15:55.120 --> 15:57.031
# No-one can be at your wedding

15:57.080 --> 15:59.799
# With a bad taste in their mouth

15:59.840 --> 16:02.274
# So we will supply the ras malai

16:02.320 --> 16:04.675
# The guests won't leave without

16:10.560 --> 16:12.278
Look at that.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.355
Come on.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.389
Hurry up.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.589
Ha!

16:15.640 --> 16:20.191
# Fancy pearls and precious stones
imported from far and wide

16:20.880 --> 16:26.079
# We melt and mould
and set for our 24-carat bride

16:26.120 --> 16:30.875
# Cut, colour, clarity,
the best you've ever seen

16:31.520 --> 16:36.355
# Only the Kohinoor is better,
but you'll have to ask the Queen

16:39.360 --> 16:41.715
# A marriage has come to town

16:41.760 --> 16:44.718
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

16:44.760 --> 16:47.194
# Life is great, let's celebrate

16:47.240 --> 16:49.959
# The sacred union two souls have found

16:54.880 --> 17:01.672
# Life and all its intricacies

17:02.720 --> 17:06.792
# We'll paint on your hands and feet

17:07.560 --> 17:14.910
# The colour of mud
shows the heat in the blood

17:16.839 --> 17:22.915
# Henna is the earth
and all her fertility

17:23.720 --> 17:29.716
# We'll darken your lifeline,
to deepen with time

17:30.440 --> 17:36.515
# Adding soul to the magic
that is to be

17:39.760 --> 17:44.197
# Your life and all its intricacies

17:45.160 --> 17:48.994
# Who can tell you more
about Yin and Yang?

17:49.960 --> 17:54.272
# Sharing one spirit
between woman and man

17:55.360 --> 17:59.558
# Marriage is the path
taken by he and she

18:00.520 --> 18:04.672
# May your new life
be kissed by harmony

18:09.520 --> 18:14.548
# It seems they had nothing
in their lives before today

18:14.600 --> 18:19.799
# And why are they so happy
to give a daughter away?

18:19.840 --> 18:24.914
# You've got what you always wanted
and for that I am glad

18:24.960 --> 18:30.273
# But just take a look around you,
the city has gone mad

18:36.040 --> 18:40.158
# Can't wait for the day,
can't keep our shoulders down

18:41.240 --> 18:45.472
# God bless you for getting
this marriage into town

18:46.480 --> 18:48.948
# A marriage has come to town

18:49.000 --> 18:51.389
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

18:51.440 --> 18:54.273
# Life is great, let's celebrate

18:54.320 --> 18:56.629
# The sacred union two souls have found

18:56.680 --> 18:59.194
# A marriage has come to town

18:59.240 --> 19:01.834
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

19:01.880 --> 19:04.474
# A marriage has come to town

19:04.520 --> 19:07.193
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

19:45.800 --> 19:47.074
Hi, hi.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.678
They look sizzling, yeah?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.392
Jaya should grab him right away.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.953
Seduce him before he leaves,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.515
give him a little taste
so he comes begging back for more.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.357
What makes you such an expert, huh?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.669
I know enough to know that if
that damn cute Darcy was looking at me

20:01.720 --> 20:04.518
the way he is looking at you now,
I wouldn't ignore him.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.551
You're nuts, Chandra.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.352
Oh, God, is he coming now?

20:09.760 --> 20:11.159
- Lalita.
- Huh?

20:11.200 --> 20:12.315
Marry him.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.839
Divorce him right away.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.199
Then give me half.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.710
Someone's having some fun up here.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.115
- It's not my tie, is it?
- No, we were just joking...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.515
- Excuse me.
- Someone's thinking of you.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.551
I'm off to get a Coke. Bye.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.838
- What'd she say?
- Oh, it's just an old saying.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.952
We say whenever you sneeze,
it means someone's thinking of you.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.474
It's probably my lawyer.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.034
Can't get any work done in the hotel I'm in.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.548
- Which hotel's that?
- It's the DN International.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.511
That's the best hotel in town.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.675
Oh.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.677
Their computer system keeps crashing,
the electricity goes.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.711
I don't know how business functions here.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.229
Are you a barrister like Balraj?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.635
No, no, no.
My family's in the hotel business.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.796
I'm sure Amritsar's hotels can't compare,

21:01.840 --> 21:04.308
but I bet there's a slight price difference.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.079
How much does it cost
to stay in one of your hotels?

21:07.120 --> 21:10.032
A good room's about four,
five hundred dollars a night.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.674
That's more than what most people
make here in a year.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.035
Well, pretty bad when you put it like that.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.877
But, people who can afford it,
they want the best. It's...

21:20.680 --> 21:23.274
There's nothing wrong
with having standards, is there?

21:23.320 --> 21:26.039
No, as long as you don't
impose them on others.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.469
- This is your first Indian wedding?
- Mmm, yeah.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.397
And it's been an experience.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.112
You're not enjoying it?

21:38.160 --> 21:42.358
No, no, I am. I just find the whole
arranged marriage thing a little strange.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.517
I don't know how two people can get married
that don't know each other.

21:45.560 --> 21:49.075
I mean, it's a little backward,
don't you think?

21:49.120 --> 21:50.519
That's such a cliche.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.950
It's different now.
It's more like a global dating service.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.470
The groom looks pretty happy.
Did his parents force him into it?

21:58.480 --> 22:01.631
No, he asked his parents
to find him a bride, actually.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.511
He was busy running his company.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.838
- He just wanted it to be simple.
- I see, and so he came here.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.032
Is that what you think, too, that India
is the place to go for a simple woman?

22:14.440 --> 22:15.759
No, that's not what I meant.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.679
Americans think they've got the answers
for everything, including marriage.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.429
Pretty arrogant, considering they've got
the highest divorce rate in the world.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.711
What I was trying to say is that
he wanted a bride who was traditional.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.116
Darcy! Stop boring her to death
and come and get down with us.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.919
Listen, er...

22:37.880 --> 22:39.996
I'm a hopeless dancer, but...

22:40.040 --> 22:43.794
well, this looks like you just screw in
a light bulb with one hand,

22:43.840 --> 22:45.478
you pet the dog with the other.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.078
Will you teach me?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.518
You know what?

22:49.560 --> 22:52.154
I think you should find someone
simple and traditional

22:52.200 --> 22:54.191
to teach you to dance like the natives.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.397
We're all flying down to Goa tomorrow.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.556
Darcy's looking into a hotel he may acquire.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.033
Mr Bakshi,

23:18.080 --> 23:20.230
we'd love for Jaya to join us as our guest.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.316
Oh, how nice, a hotel in Goa.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.995
Mr Balraj, I am not sure if it would be
appropriate to let Jaya go on her own.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.792
Oh, I understand.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.671
Don't be silly, dear.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.438
So kind of you to invite Jaya.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.311
Perhaps her sister can accompany her?

23:34.360 --> 23:37.272
- I think I can go to Goa.
- Lakhi, you're too young.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.437
- Lalita should accompany her sister.
- But, Papa...

23:40.480 --> 23:42.232
Don't be a silly girl.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.157
Go and have fun with your sister.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.115
Sure, I'd love to come with Jaya.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.072
Wonderful. I'll send the driver
over in the morning.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.951
- Good night to you all.
- Thank you.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.956
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.752
Good night.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.677
Have you gone crazy, old man?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.314
This is Jaya's chance
to win him once and for all.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.316
And he'll get to see her in a swimsuit.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.679
Are you crazy?

24:15.760 --> 24:17.671
Hello.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.631
What's this?

24:20.680 --> 24:22.591
Thank you.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.391
- Sea Breeze.
- Oh, thanks.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.437
Darcy, darling, can you tear yourself
away from the love of your life

24:43.480 --> 24:46.631
and put some lotion on my back?
I don't want to get too dark.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.830
I'm writing to my little sister Georgie.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.836
Oh, my God!

24:50.880 --> 24:52.791
You lugged that all this way?

24:52.840 --> 24:55.832
That explains why you haven't got
much room for outfits.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.552
Do you have something
against books?

24:57.600 --> 25:00.558
Or do you resent them because
they leave less room for make-up?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.397
No.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.351
No, I just never
have time for them.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.756
Indians here have
a lot more free time.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.077
Or maybe you're just a much more
accomplished woman than I am.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.076
Mm-hm. Maybe.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.471
Darcy's a great reader.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.712
In fact, I think a love of books
is on his list for his ideal woman.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.069
I think you've had one
too many Sea Breezes.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.999
I remember a very drunken night
in Oxford when you recited the list.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.838
She has to be smart,
speak several languages...

25:32.880 --> 25:34.552
All right, Kiran, drop it.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.319
No, I recall, she had to be athletic,

25:37.360 --> 25:39.555
voluptuous, of course,

25:39.600 --> 25:42.068
graceful, witty, confident...

25:42.120 --> 25:45.999
I'm not surprised Mr Darcy hasn't found
his ideal woman with a list like that.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.951
Does this mean you're an ideal man?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.151
I guess you'd be
a better judge of that than me.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.350
As far as I can tell,
most men have faults.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.153
Arrogance, pride, vanity...

25:56.200 --> 25:58.634
She's certainly read
you like a book, Darcy.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.711
No.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.791
I just think you got me all wrong.

26:04.840 --> 26:09.038
Well, you'd certainly have trouble
finding your ideal woman in India.

26:09.080 --> 26:13.039
I didn't hear "simple", "traditional",
"subservient" on your list.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.719
Come on, give me a break.
Now you're twisting my words.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.910
You said yourself that
you're used to the best.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.030
I'm sure you think
India's beneath you.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.877
If I really thought that,

26:22.920 --> 26:25.798
then why would I be thinking
about buying this place?

26:25.840 --> 26:27.558
You think this is India?

26:27.600 --> 26:30.398
Well, don't you wanna see
more investment, more jobs?

26:30.440 --> 26:32.158
Yes, but who does it
really benefit?

26:32.880 --> 26:36.634
You want people to come to India
without having to deal with Indians.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.229
That's good. Remind me to add that
to the tourism brochure.

26:40.280 --> 26:44.159
Isn't that what all tourists want here?
5-star comfort with a bit of culture thrown in?

26:44.200 --> 26:46.475
I don't want you turning India
into a theme park.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.988
I thought we got rid of
imperialists like you.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.315
I'm not British. I'm American.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.271
Exactly.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.071
What the hell's he doing here?

28:11.080 --> 28:12.513
Oh, my God.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.719
Hello.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.113
# Enter in the dance
Plug it in an' we begin

28:35.160 --> 28:37.037
# Crowd up in the centre

28:37.080 --> 28:38.991
# They watch be dibidim

28:39.040 --> 28:42.237
# Watch the way we drop it
in a mix timing

28:42.600 --> 28:45.592
# Rise and amplifying
when we come in with the swing

28:46.160 --> 28:49.038
# Just following the back
an' naturally harmonisin'

28:49.720 --> 28:52.951
# Climb into position
with synchronised things

28:53.520 --> 28:56.432
# Live from out the ghetto we maximisin'

28:57.000 --> 29:00.197
# Sound of the Groove Armada,
we superstylin'

29:05.480 --> 29:07.391
# We superstylin'...

29:16.000 --> 29:17.911
- Hello again.
- Hi.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.392
- How are you?
- Fine. Thanks.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.795
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.116
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not much of a drinker.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.072
Neither am I. I only drink here
cos it's cheaper than the water.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.671
I'm Johnny, by the way.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.312
Johnny Wickham.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.590
Pleased to meet you, Johnny. I'm Lalita.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.991
Lalita.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.877
How do you know Will Darcy?

29:44.920 --> 29:46.831
I saw you two blank each other.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.319
I was going to go over
and say hi to the guy,

29:51.360 --> 29:54.033
but then I realised I'd have
to talk to the wanker.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.877
We sort of grew up together,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.992
cos my mum used to work for
Darcy's family in England.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.951
She was his nanny.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.992
See, their family had a couple
of big old country hotels.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.951
Dad was a really keen golfer.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.275
Well, Darcy's dad was
a really keen golfer.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.788
I used to caddy for him.
Really nice old fella.

30:11.760 --> 30:16.675
Gave me a great job when I left school,
and I don't know, Darcy was never too keen.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.311
So when the old man died
a few years back,

30:20.360 --> 30:23.113
you can guess who was
the first one to get fired.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.798
What, just like that?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.434
With his dad gone,
he didn't have to explain, did he?

30:27.480 --> 30:29.357
But your mum helped raise him.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.072
Yes, she did.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.714
You know, Darcy's mum
is even worse than he is.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.715
She's been trying
to get him hitched to this...

30:36.760 --> 30:38.352
this rich New York girl for years.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.038
It's the ultimate business merger.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.310
So she's arranging his marriage?

30:43.200 --> 30:45.953
- You could call it that, yeah.
- What a hypocrite.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.434
See, that's the great thing
about living in India.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.074
You don't have to have money
to enjoy this place,

30:56.120 --> 31:00.671
and if you have money, you never get
to see the real India, you know?

31:01.720 --> 31:05.110
I just feel like people here
have got their priorities sorted.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.391
I'd love for you to come to Amritsar.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.351
It's... It's beautiful.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.195
It's just that not many
tourists go there.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.991
Am... Amritsar?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.508
Is that where
the Golden Temple is?

31:20.800 --> 31:22.711
Yeah.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.075
I'm sorry we're leaving today,
but I'd love to show you my home town.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.111
Yeah, I'd love to show you London.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.115
# My eyes are searching
My hips are working

31:33.160 --> 31:35.628
# My lips are waiting
Take me to love

31:35.680 --> 31:37.875
# My skin's pulsating
My body's shaking

31:37.920 --> 31:40.388
# My lips are aching
Take me to love

31:40.440 --> 31:42.795
# Payal bajake
Gungru bajake

31:42.840 --> 31:45.149
# Tu je divana kar dar la

31:45.200 --> 31:46.394
# Churi bajake

31:46.440 --> 31:47.714
# Chutkhi bajake

31:47.760 --> 31:49.478
# Tu je divana kar dar la

32:04.280 --> 32:08.558
# India's the place for me

32:08.600 --> 32:12.878
# India sets you free

32:13.840 --> 32:17.310
# Shola badan hai mera

32:18.120 --> 32:21.908
# Badan pay sitare hai

32:23.240 --> 32:27.518
# Akho me hai bijiliah

32:27.560 --> 32:32.031
# Le bo meh shirareh hai

32:32.720 --> 32:35.154
# My eyes are searching
My hips are working

32:35.200 --> 32:37.111
# My lips are waiting
Take me to love

32:39.000 --> 32:42.675
# Oh! Whoa-oh!

32:43.480 --> 32:46.153
# Take me

32:46.200 --> 32:49.510
# Take me to love

32:49.560 --> 32:51.471
# To love

33:05.600 --> 33:07.875
Oh, my God!

33:16.000 --> 33:18.150
Hurry up, Bijili.
And be careful!

33:18.200 --> 33:20.111
Oh!

33:21.960 --> 33:24.474
- Ah, you're back.
- What's going on, Lakhi?

33:24.520 --> 33:25.953
Everything OK?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.911
- Yes, Mama, it was lovely.
- Good.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.714
Now one is all but taken care of,
we have to prepare for Number 2.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.751
- What?
- Maya, hurry up with the bucket!

33:33.800 --> 33:35.597
He'll be here soon.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.552
- Who? Who, Mama?
- Don't ask me.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.636
Kholi saab. He's on his way
from the airport.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.193
- Who?
- Kholi.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.597
He's your father's sister's husband's sister's son.
And he's a top accountant in California.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.631
But why is he coming here?

33:48.680 --> 33:51.114
To look at me for his bride.
What do you think?

33:56.520 --> 33:59.273
Hurry up, girls, come on here.
I want to look at you.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.276
Hurry up, hurry up. Come on, fast.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.470
Now, listen to me carefully, girls, huh.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.274
It's very important to make a good
first impression on Kholi saab.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.629
Stand straight... smile...

34:10.360 --> 34:12.828
...don't talk unnecessarily,

34:12.880 --> 34:15.678
and don't say anything too intelligent. You!

34:15.719 --> 34:18.393
Shame she only selectively practises
what she preaches.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.748
Why don't you go outside
and welcome the guest?

34:20.800 --> 34:21.869
I'll do that.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.353
Bijili, go outside and get the luggage.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.311
Mamaji! Whassup!

34:28.000 --> 34:29.911
Hello. How are you?

34:31.080 --> 34:33.230
Yes, madam, no problem. Bijili is here.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.190
Go outside, you bloody fool.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.831
Hey, hey! Eurgh!

34:39.600 --> 34:41.112
Bijili.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.150
- Oh.
- Hey!

34:43.199 --> 34:45.554
Come in, Kholi saab. Welcome.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.511
We weren't expecting you so early.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.471
You've really taken us by surprise.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.876
What a pleasure to see you, Mamaji,
after so long time.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.350
Oh. Oh, ho.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.709
Oh, of course. You remember my daughters.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.914
Jaya, Lalita,

35:02.960 --> 35:05.315
Maya and Lakhi.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.032
Oh!

35:07.080 --> 35:11.437
From small great caterpillars
to such beautiful b-butterflies.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.228
And so like you...
Madame Butterfly.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.518
This is my dream home.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.788
Colonial style.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.912
Five bedrooms,
three and a half bathrooms,

35:25.960 --> 35:28.758
$850,000.

35:29.480 --> 35:32.392
- That's four crores, 25 lakhs.
- Oh, my.

35:32.440 --> 35:33.998
I bought it only six months ago.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.759
It's already worth $900,000.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.870
I bet it has three swimming pools.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.679
Actually, the complex has
two pools, er, plus my crib.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.398
It has its own hot-tub bath
with super-jets.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.078
It's the bomb.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.316
Is it near Beverly Hills
9-zero-2-1-zero?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.713
No.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.557
No, it's in the valley.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.275
Er, but 20 minutes down 101 Freeway,
and you're in North Hollywood.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.473
Did you hear that, Lalita?

36:06.520 --> 36:08.556
He lives in Hollywood.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.158
You must join me in US.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.395
You must, you must, you must. Eh?

36:12.440 --> 36:16.149
I could help you start a business there.
That's where the money's to be made.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.589
UK's finished, India's too corrupt.

36:18.640 --> 36:22.349
Kholi saab, India is still a
young country since Independence.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.550
I hardly think its potential is over.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.478
What do you think your US was like
after 60 years of independence?

36:27.520 --> 36:30.796
They were killing each other with slavery
and blindly searching for gold.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.150
I tell you, boss, I've made a packet
as an accountant in LA.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.078
You know, the Indian community there
is very professional,

36:44.120 --> 36:47.078
all doctors and computers and...

36:47.120 --> 36:52.433
not like these uneducated
minicab/7-Eleven store types.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.516
It's ours for the taking.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.630
Anyone can become an American.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.956
Then... why come back here?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.355
Ah... ba da bing, ba da boom.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.719
"Ba da bing, ba da boom"?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.716
There's only one problem with America.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.910
Our girls that are born there,

37:08.960 --> 37:11.269
they've totally lost their roots.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.436
Completely clueless.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.675
Our girls are very rooted.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.837
They're really very, very traditional, huh?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.199
You know, in US,

37:21.240 --> 37:24.437
they're all too outspoken
and career-orientated.

37:24.480 --> 37:28.519
And some have even turned into...

37:29.800 --> 37:31.119
...the lesbian.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.989
So that leaves me no choice.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.396
I may be healthy, wealthy and wise,

37:38.440 --> 37:43.150
but as they say,
"no life... without wife".

37:45.600 --> 37:47.556
Kholi saab.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.993
You're a poet as well.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.270
Did you hear that, Mr Bakshi? Huh?

37:53.320 --> 37:55.914
- No life without wife.
- Yes.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.996
Very wisely spoken.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.998
I think God is smiling down on me.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.474
I'm spoilt for choice in this house.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.717
I suppose, as the eldest...

38:08.600 --> 38:10.318
...Jaya must be the first choice.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.909
Actually... er, Kholi saab...

38:13.960 --> 38:17.873
Jaya is practically
engaged to someone else.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.989
Oh.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.430
Er, b-b-but, er,
Lalita is unspoken for.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.833
La-Lalita.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.952
Lalita.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.394
# Lonely Mr Kholi from Los Angeles

38:37.800 --> 38:40.075
# Came to Punjab on one bent knee

38:40.120 --> 38:42.714
# He had a Green Card, new house, big cash

38:43.040 --> 38:45.474
# Still made a wish with every fallen lash

38:45.520 --> 38:47.556
# For you to do the journey with him

38:47.600 --> 38:50.194
# To smile when he got home,
ask how his day had been

38:50.240 --> 38:52.515
# He wants you by his side,
in joy and strife

38:52.560 --> 38:54.471
# Poor Mr Kholi

38:54.520 --> 38:57.671
# He has no life without wife

38:57.720 --> 38:58.994
# No life

38:59.960 --> 39:01.279
# Without wife

39:03.160 --> 39:06.232
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah yeah

39:07.640 --> 39:08.914
# No life

39:09.960 --> 39:11.871
# Without wife

39:11.960 --> 39:13.871
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

39:14.520 --> 39:16.909
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

39:17.880 --> 39:20.394
# I don't want a man who ties me down

39:20.440 --> 39:22.795
# Does what he wants while I hang around

39:22.840 --> 39:25.434
# I don't want a man who's crude and loud

39:25.480 --> 39:27.630
# Who wants a pretty wife to make him proud

39:27.680 --> 39:30.194
# I don't want a man who can't be funny

39:30.240 --> 39:32.549
# Tells tall tales about making money

39:32.600 --> 39:34.318
# Oh, yeah

39:35.200 --> 39:39.273
# I don't want a man
who'll grab the best seat

39:40.440 --> 39:43.830
# Can't close his mouth
when he starts to eat

39:45.440 --> 39:49.228
# I don't want a man
who likes to drink

39:50.200 --> 39:54.193
# Or leaves his dirty dishes in the sink

39:55.520 --> 39:57.909
# I don't want a man
who wants his mummy

39:57.960 --> 40:00.394
# A balding pest
with too much tummy

40:00.440 --> 40:02.908
# I don't want a man
who's dead in the head

40:02.960 --> 40:04.234
# Poor Mr Kholi

40:04.280 --> 40:05.474
# Hai, Mr Kholi

40:05.520 --> 40:07.112
# Maybe he's good in bed

40:11.280 --> 40:12.474
Euurghh!

40:13.560 --> 40:15.357
# No life

40:15.960 --> 40:17.473
# Without wife

40:19.240 --> 40:22.277
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah yeah

40:23.640 --> 40:25.835
# No life

40:25.880 --> 40:27.996
# Without wife

40:28.040 --> 40:30.190
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

40:30.560 --> 40:33.552
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

40:38.520 --> 40:41.353
# What you don't want
don't matter no more

40:41.400 --> 40:43.789
# Soon you'll be married
and ready to go

40:43.840 --> 40:46.308
# A match made in heaven
just like milk and honey

40:46.360 --> 40:48.954
# You make aloo gobi,
he'll make the money

40:49.000 --> 40:51.389
# Every day will be the same,
according to his plan

40:51.440 --> 40:55.513
# Forget what you want,
Mr Kholi's now your man

40:56.280 --> 40:58.271
# No life

40:58.320 --> 41:00.436
# Without wife

41:01.760 --> 41:04.194
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah yeah

41:05.240 --> 41:07.595
# I just want a man with real soul

41:07.640 --> 41:10.029
# Who wants equality and not control

41:10.080 --> 41:12.674
# I just want a man good and smart

41:12.720 --> 41:15.314
# A really sharp mind and a very big heart

41:15.360 --> 41:17.510
# I just want a man not scared to weep

41:17.560 --> 41:20.199
# To hold me close when we're asleep

41:20.240 --> 41:22.117
# Oh, yeah

41:22.880 --> 41:26.839
# I just want a man who loves romance

41:27.520 --> 41:31.479
# Will clear the floor and ask me to dance

41:32.800 --> 41:35.155
# I just want a man who gives some back

41:35.200 --> 41:37.794
# Who talks to me and not my rack

41:37.840 --> 41:40.229
# I just want a man whose spirit is free

41:40.280 --> 41:42.874
# Will hold my hand, walk the world with me

41:42.920 --> 41:44.717
# Oh, yeah

41:44.760 --> 41:46.955
# No life

41:47.000 --> 41:49.389
# Without wife

41:50.480 --> 41:53.916
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah yeah

41:54.880 --> 41:56.279
# No life

41:57.280 --> 41:59.236

# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

42:02.120 --> 42:04.429
# Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

42:11.520 --> 42:15.638
# Sorry, Mr Kholi, it is not to be

42:15.680 --> 42:20.834
# My heart is set on another, you see

42:20.880 --> 42:26.000
# The wandering soul I was meant to meet

42:26.040 --> 42:30.989
# Has finally come and swept me off my feet

42:32.840 --> 42:37.755
# Now I dream of what it would be like

42:37.800 --> 42:42.794
# To be an overseas bride dressed in white

42:43.440 --> 42:48.275
# To have a little home in the country

42:48.720 --> 42:53.748
# And live in the land of Her Majesty

43:40.880 --> 43:42.359
Come, come.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.799
Thank you.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.878
Yes?

43:46.920 --> 43:48.558
Um, nameste gee.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.070
Er, I came to see Lalita.
I'm friends with her.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.838
Friends?

43:53.880 --> 43:55.313
Yes.

43:56.520 --> 43:57.839
Lalita!

43:57.880 --> 43:59.996
Yes, Mama.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.679
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.914
- You made it.
- Yeah.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.598
- Come in.
- Thank you.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.870
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thank you.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.433
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, Jaya.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.152
- How are you?
- Yeah.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.555
Papa, this is our friend from Goa.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.478
- Johnny Wickham. He's from London.
- Chaman Bakshi.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.795
Oh, pleased to meet you. Johnny Wickham.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.751
He wanted to see
the Golden Temple.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.951
So, do you think he could stay
with us, Papa? Please?

44:24.000 --> 44:27.151
Yes, of course. We can do with
some fresh conversation here.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.758
I'll show you the guest room.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.313
Thank you very much, Mr Bakshi.

44:30.360 --> 44:32.032
Mrs Bakshi.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.237
- Oh, God, he's too yum.
- Sshh, he'll hear you.

44:36.280 --> 44:39.829
He cannot stay here.
Hippies are dirty and they steal.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.677
Mama, he's not a hippy.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.711
And what will Kholi saab say?

44:43.760 --> 44:46.672
He is staying here in a house
full of young unmarried women?

44:46.720 --> 44:49.712
Mr Kholi's been in the house a day
and is already running things?

44:49.760 --> 44:52.149
We can take him to the
Garbha tonight. No, Mama?

44:52.200 --> 44:55.158
Lalita, please may I have
the first dance with him?

44:55.200 --> 44:56.679
See what you've started.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.154
Don't be ridiculous.
He cannot come to the Garbha.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.953
But, Mama, there's never enough
cute boys to dance with.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.672
Have you all gone mad?

45:03.720 --> 45:06.359
What will Balraj think of us
if we all land up there with him?

45:06.400 --> 45:07.549
It's really unfair.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.749
What's unfair?

45:08.800 --> 45:11.314
Papa, she will not have our friend
come to the Garbha.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.669
Of course he should come
and see Garbha with us.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.278
I just invited him.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.069
This is really a madhouse.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.317
I'm so glad he's come.
I really didn't think he'd make it.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.237
I can't wait to see Balraj.

45:30.280 --> 45:33.078
I wish he didn't have to bring
that Darcy with him.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.236
There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

45:37.040 --> 45:41.795
If Darcy is Balraj's best friend, he can't
be as awful as Johnny thinks he is.

45:41.840 --> 45:45.071
Jaya, you look absolutely beautiful.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.195
And, Lalita, you look nice too.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.992
You've really made
an effort tonight.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.191
No doubt you had
certain someone in mind.

45:55.800 --> 45:58.075
Hey, mastered the Garbha already?

45:58.120 --> 46:00.395
Ah, no, I can only
hope and pray, really.

46:00.440 --> 46:03.512
But um, Lakhi's a great teacher,
though. Really good.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.028
His Garbha style is killing, man.

46:06.080 --> 46:09.038
- Jaya, they're here. Quickly. Move, please.
- Sorry.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.832
- Don't worry.
- Lakhi.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.478
I'm so sorry about my mother.
She can be a little abrupt.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.317
There's no need to apologise.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.952
I appreciate her letting me stay.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.112
I'm so glad you came.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.435
You couldn't come to India
and not see Amritsar.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.198
No, you, you were right.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.916
It's very beautiful.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.749
You sure you're ready for this?

46:32.800 --> 46:34.313
I'm willing to take the risk.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.839
- Well...
- Hello.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.757
Oh, hi. Hi. Hey, there, buddy.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.756
Hi, buddy, how are you?

46:39.800 --> 46:41.995
Madam, would you do me the honour?

46:42.040 --> 46:44.679
You know, actually,
I prefer American hip-hop,

46:44.720 --> 46:47.314
but as Gloria Estefan says,

46:47.360 --> 46:49.396
"The rhythm is going to get you."

46:50.440 --> 46:52.351
So, bring it on.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.472
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.954
You look like you were
working hard out there.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.911
Hey, there, partner.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.473
This is Mr Kholi.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.954
And this is my best friend,
Chandra Lamba.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.798
It's such a great pleasure to meet
yet another beautiful young lady.

48:12.800 --> 48:15.758
There must be something magical
in the water in Amritsar.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.791
I'd happily get drunk on it.

48:19.520 --> 48:23.433
Please, er, can I have the honour of
getting you ladies a... a soft drink?

48:23.480 --> 48:24.959
- Yes, please.
- Oh.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.513
- Thank you.
- Oh.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.073
Oh, my God, I thought he was going
to put you in hospital out there.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.519
Try eating with him.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.199
It's like looking at a
Jackson Pollock painting.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.915
So... Jaya told me
you met someone in Goa.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.598
Maybe.

48:43.640 --> 48:47.189
So Mr Darcy didn't manage
to seduce the jewel of Amritsar?

48:47.240 --> 48:50.232
Please, he's such
a conceited, arrogant...

48:50.280 --> 48:51.599
Hello, Lalita.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.788
H-hello.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.273
- H-hi.
- Hi.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.879
I've been studying
this Garbha thing.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.953
It's a little out of my league,
but what the hell?

49:04.960 --> 49:06.359
Would you like to dance?

49:12.320 --> 49:13.878
Sure.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.073
Lalita?

49:25.120 --> 49:26.951
She... She...

49:34.920 --> 49:37.878
I believe we're coming to your house
for dinner tomorrow night.

49:37.920 --> 49:40.195
Balraj said your father invited us all.

49:40.240 --> 49:43.915
Can't wait. Surprised to see
your old friend Johnny?

49:45.800 --> 49:48.598
I wasn't so much surprised
as disappointed.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.517
He's staying with us.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.676
My family really like him.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.916
Oh, yeah, everyone
loves Wickham.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.758
He makes friends easily,
but he loses them just as quickly.

49:59.800 --> 50:02.837
And what about you?
Are you a loyal friend?

50:02.880 --> 50:05.030
What are you talking about?

50:05.080 --> 50:07.355
I've heard so many things
about you, Darcy.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.879
I can't seem to figure you out.

50:09.880 --> 50:12.519
Maybe you shouldn't listen
to everything you hear.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.198
You should talk.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.232
After all the rubbish you said
about arranged marriages,

50:17.280 --> 50:20.317
I can't believe your mother's
arranging yours.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.034
May I have this dance,
Madam Bakshi?

50:25.080 --> 50:27.230
I thought you'd never ask.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.236
Shall we, er...?

51:15.400 --> 51:18.312
Lalita! Bijili!

51:18.360 --> 51:20.157
Where is my china?

51:20.200 --> 51:23.988
I'm sorry about this stupid dinner tonight.
I... I wanted you to join us.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.951
Don't worry about it.
I'm used to it.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.676
Still, I wish you could come.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.188
It would make this evening
a lot less boring.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.509
Ah, there you are!

51:38.560 --> 51:40.676
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.233
Where have you been?

51:42.280 --> 51:45.192
Lakhi's decided she wants
to show me the town tonight.

51:45.240 --> 51:50.109
I'm going to take him for Amritsari fish,
fruit cream and hot gulab jamans.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.673
That's nice.

51:51.720 --> 51:54.598
- Why are you looking? Look at me.
- Bring my china!

51:54.640 --> 51:56.437
- Stop it. What?
- Chelo, Bijili.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.152
Bring the ones which are not chipped.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.349
Don't.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.118
I'm warning you.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.870
The Cobra dance.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.717
Thank you.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.398
That was lovely, Maya.

53:40.360 --> 53:43.158
- Papa, shall I play the sitar now?
- That's all right, Maya.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.873
You have entertained us enough
for the evening. Thank you.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.638
Very good.

53:50.080 --> 53:54.790
I still can't believe I'm sitting with
a Darcy in Amritsar of all places.

53:54.840 --> 53:58.037
- This world is too small, no, dude?
- Way too small.

53:58.080 --> 54:03.393
Lalita, my firm has been doing business
for many years with Darcy's mother,

54:03.440 --> 54:06.079
Ms Catherine, beautiful lady.

54:06.120 --> 54:09.192
- She has a such big hotel in Beverly Hills.
- Can I get anyone a drink?

54:09.240 --> 54:10.992
- Me, please.
- Yes, please.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.393
Let me help you with that.

54:14.320 --> 54:17.676
Why don't you all have something?
Balraj, have something.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.631
I saw you dance with Wickham,

54:19.680 --> 54:21.989
and I hear from Darcy
that he's staying with you.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.439
Yeah.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.879
So?

54:25.600 --> 54:28.398
Don't fall for his bullshit.
He's more trouble than he looks.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.476
His mother was Darcy's nanny,
therefore...

54:30.520 --> 54:31.919
And you're Darcy's friend.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.190
Of course you'd take
his side, wouldn't you?

54:34.240 --> 54:36.549
There's no crime in being
the son of a servant.

54:38.640 --> 54:43.077
I have heard so many stories about
your Mr Darcy saab in Goa, Balraj.

54:43.120 --> 54:46.795
Mmm, let's just say that Darcy and India
have had a little bit of a rough time.

54:46.840 --> 54:50.628
Ah, these Indians, they don't know
how to treat tourists.

54:50.680 --> 54:53.672
- There's no sophistication.
- What do you mean "these Indians"?

54:53.720 --> 54:57.349
- Are you no longer an Indian?
- I'm a Green Card holder now.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.994
India is decades behind.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.918
Oh, I think there is a lot
about India that we don't have.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.359
Oh, really? Like what?

55:09.400 --> 55:13.359
Well, I think it's nice the way
the families, um, come together.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.719
I lost my father a while back

55:15.760 --> 55:18.354
and my mum spends a lot of
her time in New York,

55:18.400 --> 55:21.119
so, my sister and I, we don't
really have a family home.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.549
And I can't remember
the last time that all my family

55:23.600 --> 55:25.716
kind of got together like this.

55:25.760 --> 55:29.548
Oh, Kholi saab is only trying
to win over my daughters.

55:29.600 --> 55:34.594
Yes, he wants them to be in love
with America as much as he is.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.835
And why is that?

55:36.880 --> 55:40.031
Well, you can see for yourself, Mr Darcy,

55:40.080 --> 55:44.631
they are all exceptional marriageable
prospects for any single young man.

55:44.680 --> 55:48.070
I hope you brought
big appetites.

55:48.120 --> 55:50.714
Mrs Bakshi has planned
a special feast for all of us.

55:50.760 --> 55:55.117
The truth is that Kholi saab
was quite taken by Jaya at first,

55:55.160 --> 55:58.914
but after I explained to him
that she was being coveted

55:58.960 --> 56:03.317
by another fine gentleman from abroad,
I then steered him towards Lalita.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.550
Balraj, you are a very lucky man.

56:07.600 --> 56:11.752
Jaya's had many suitors before,
with her great beauty and fine figure,

56:11.800 --> 56:14.439
but none were
good enough for her.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.869
You two will make a fine couple

56:16.920 --> 56:19.229
and you will have no regrets
on your wedding night.

56:35.280 --> 56:38.272
Lalita Beti!

56:40.080 --> 56:43.709
Jaya, I need some help
in the kitchen.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.714
Come, come.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.829
Come on.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.591
Phew.

57:15.640 --> 57:17.232
Power walking.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.192
It's so healthy.
Everyone in LA is so healthy.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.549
They all like to exercise
but not read.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.637
Oh, no, no. There are great
bookstores too, word up.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.671
There's nothing
you can't find in LA.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.757
Nothing? You sure you don't miss
some things from here?

57:32.800 --> 57:36.236
Well, er, to be honest...

57:38.600 --> 57:41.717
what I do miss most
is companionship.

57:41.760 --> 57:45.469
You know, you can get very lonely
in such a big place and...

57:45.520 --> 57:46.635
and...

57:47.640 --> 57:49.517
Lalita, I like you.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.550
You're very peppy and bright,

57:52.600 --> 57:54.795
and I wanna marry you
and bring you back.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.910
- I spoke to your mother...
- You spoke to her?

57:56.960 --> 57:58.678
Yes, she's very enthusiastic.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.871
I'm sorry, you should have
spoken to me first.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.512
I'm not ready to be married.

58:03.560 --> 58:06.279
I... I really can't accept.

58:06.320 --> 58:09.676
Well, Lalita, I'm offering
to take you to America, huh?

58:09.720 --> 58:12.154
You and your family will have
no more worries.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.152
I could never be the kind of wife
that could make you happy.

58:19.440 --> 58:22.352
And I don't think you could
make me happy either.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.389
I work for some of the
richest people in America.

58:26.440 --> 58:30.149
I have savings and bonds and stocks
and you wouldn't even have to work.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.599
But I like working.

58:31.640 --> 58:33.756
OK. OK. Oh...

58:33.800 --> 58:37.031
You know, you may never get
such a good offer like this one again.

58:38.040 --> 58:39.758
I'm sorry.

58:43.440 --> 58:46.318
It's too, too much tension
for me now.

58:47.400 --> 58:50.153
She is happy to let us
all be ruined.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.150
You must speak to her, old man.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.509
She wants love to be there
from the beginning.

58:56.560 --> 58:59.836
Where was the love-shove
when we first got married, huh?

59:01.000 --> 59:05.516
Tell her. Tell her that you
marry first, then love grows.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.474
I'll never speak to her again
if she refuses him.

59:10.800 --> 59:13.394
Lalita, do you understand
what your mother is saying?

59:14.600 --> 59:19.754
She is saying that she will never speak to you
again if you do not marry Kholi saab. No?

59:19.800 --> 59:20.869
Yes.

59:22.640 --> 59:25.996
And I will never speak
to you again if you... do.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.268
What?

59:31.640 --> 59:33.517
Oh, Kholi, Kholi saab.

59:33.560 --> 59:34.754
Where are you going?

59:34.800 --> 59:37.189
Listen to me, Kholi saab. Listen to me.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.515
Please don't leave like this.
Kholi saab?

59:40.320 --> 59:41.548
Kholi saab?

59:41.600 --> 59:44.239
Kholi saab? Kholi saab,
please listen to me.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.510
Oh, my God. Kholi saab,
I'll talk to her.

59:46.560 --> 59:49.677
Just listen to me. I'm sure
she will understand, Khol...

59:49.720 --> 59:52.393
Oh, Jaya, Balraj is here.

59:53.560 --> 59:54.834
Kholi saab.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.393
- I thought you were leaving next week.
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.512
I've just found out that I have to be
on the next flight back to London.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.437
Some important business has come up.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.198
- Hang on a sec.
- Where are you going?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.629
Kiran and Darcy want to go home too, so...

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.839
Yeah.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.028
I understand.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.150
But I'll e-mail you
as soon as I get back. OK?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.268
Well, I... suppose I'd better go.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.593
Everything OK?

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.719
Bye.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.912
Mama!

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.518
Mama.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.835
Mama, you won't believe
what has happened.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.155
Jaya, Lalita, come fast.
You won't believe this.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.599
What is wrong?

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.837
Papa, Kholi has proposed to Chandra Lamba.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.995
- What?
- What?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.272
- I bet she gave him two tight slaps.
- No, she said yes.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.799
And you know what?

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.035
They're having a small temple ceremony here,

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.799
and then a big American wedding in LA.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.478
No.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.633
I can't believe
my best friend would do that.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.197
One billion Indians and she had
to marry one of the stupidest?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.357
People do horrible things for money.
And a Green Card, too.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.469
No, no.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.715
But on the inside,
Chandra is not like that.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.036
Not everyone can stand up to the pressure
the way you can, Lalita.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.151
Better single than unhappy.
Tikk hai nah?

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.798
I have to go.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.035
My mates are waiting for me
in Varanasi.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.954
And I don't want to go but I don't
want to desert my mates either.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.196
Of course.
Of course you should go.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.834
I knew you wouldn't stay for ever.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.238
Johnny! Wait, you
can't leave without me.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.679
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.597
Oh. Oh, Lakhi.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.471
You'll come back, nah?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.839
Maybe, yeah.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.348
And, and don't you dare
remove this, OK?

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.949
You know it's bad luck if you do,
and you promised you wouldn't.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.831
All right, well, um...

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.711
Well, I'd better go. OK?

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.432
I don't want to miss that train.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.038
Come.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.795
# Show me the way

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.434
# Take me to love

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.399
# Another world

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.113
# How I long to be

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.711
# Where fallen stars must lie

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.150
# Roses bloom, never die

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.031
# Show me the way

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.991
# Take me to love

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.395
# Show me the way

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.034
# Take me to love

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.317
# A cold sunset

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.870
# Gold drop, left to melt

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.998
# Close my eyes and wish I could see

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.197
# If it is near

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.596
# Or far from me

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.234
# This place called love

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.151
# Is it for real?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.838
# Or is it just a dream?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.311
# Show me the way

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.316
# Take me to love

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.915
# Another world

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.793
# How I long to be

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.237
# Under clouds that don't cry

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.477
# Wounded birds can soar high

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.715
# Show me the way

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.149
# Take me to love

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.197
Sit down. It will pick up.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.032
Hello? Bakshis' residence.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.115
Yes.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.838
Why, hello, Kholi saab.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.717
Really?

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.035
That's very kind of you.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.913
It's really too much.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.316
Chandra wants us to be
at her wedding in LA.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.476
They are sending us four tickets.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.272
Come on.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.269
Hi, Chandra.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.629
Four tickets.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.274
It's so good to hear you
sounding so happy.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.711
Jaya, we can stop over in London.
You can meet Balraj again.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.557
All right, love.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.159
Hello?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.997
Is that Kiran?

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.874
Hi. It's Jaya Bakshi...
from Amritsar.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.709
Actually, we were just
passing through London.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.079
Really?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.109
OK.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.991
We'll come by today, then.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.189
Great.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.753
Bye.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.915
See!

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.871
How nice to see you all again
in our part of the world.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.959
The Thames.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.433
Windsor Castle.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.516
Oh, flag's up, Queen's at home.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.673
The Queen?

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.073
So many lovely paintings.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.869
- Is that an Andy Warhol?
- Wrong decade.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.514
We have several originals
Mummy found in Barcelona.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.437
Oh, Italian. How nice.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.597
Do sit down.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:20.077
Lakhi.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.951
- Oh, my God. Johnny!
- Hey!

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.434
How are you? Oh, my God.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:27.517
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I came here to surprise you.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.073
You have. It's a
lovely surprise. Thank you.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.031
We brought her over from India.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.712
Don't know how we'd manage without her.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.229
Um, won't Balraj
be joining us for tea?

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:41.747
Oh, no. Didn't I tell you?
Balraj isn't here.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.031
He's in New York
with my parents.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.232
No, you didn't tell me.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.511
Yeah... they wanted him to meet
a couple of girls out there.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.913
Cake?

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.678
Lemon one's low fat.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.508
Flight 714 to Los Angeles
is now ready for boarding.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.394
Would all first-class passengers
please make their way to gate 37.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.997
Lalita?

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.634
- Hey.
- Oh, wow.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.158
Hi.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.158
I was just checking in and I...

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.633
You're on your way to LA?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.319
Yes, we are going for Kholi's wedding.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.587
Oh, of course.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.270
They are booked into our hotel in Beverly Hills.
It's beautiful in the garden for a wedding.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:38.551
- Oh, should we be getting on too?
- Not yet, Mama.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.830
They let first class on
before everyone else.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.916
I hope we are in better seats.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.157
Oooh, it was so crowded
and noisy coming from Delhi.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.234
Yeah.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.191
I had a meeting in London.
On my way home.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.713
Well, it's nice to see you all.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.432
Maybe I'll see you
at the wedding.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.831
Thank God we're in economy.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.191
One thing I asked - not to be
near the toilets.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.437
How will we sleep with all the
flush noise and the doors banging?

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.469
Hello.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.437
- Pretty cramped back here, huh?
- Yes. No leg-room for my blood circulation.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.870
Mrs Bakshi, would you like to
exchange seats with me in first?

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.433
No, we're fine, thank you.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.232
Really, young man?

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.679
Me in first class?

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.358
- Are you sure?
- Yes, please.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.075
- It's the least I could do to repay your hospitality.
- Sure.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.678
Show me.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.278
Come, show me.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.312
Well, who could have guessed
he'd be so thoughtful?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.836
Another glass of
champagne, madame?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.996
Yes. Thank you.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.035
Well, your mom's very happy.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.550
Thank you, but you really
didn't need to do that.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.875
Oh, it's a very small
price to pay,

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.754
if it means I get to sit next to you
for the next ten hours and 53 minutes.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.990
Well, I do intend to sleep
for at least ten of those hours.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.034
Yeah.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.759
How's Wickham?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.917
Don't know,
haven't heard from him.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.030
Well, that sounds just like him.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.110
Why do you hate him so much?

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.473
Listen, Lalita, some things
are best left unsaid.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.158
Now, I wouldn't lie to you.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.509
You just have to trust me -
he's a nasty piece of work.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.230
I would hate it if he ever hurt you.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.235
I wanted to tell you in India but...

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.232
Well, I'm glad that I can
warn you now.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.957
Warn me?

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.632
Let's just say it's a good thing
that he hasn't been in touch.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.793
And I guess the way you two were dancing...

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.792
I was a little jealous.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.831
What's going on with Balraj?

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.909
He never wrote or called Jaya
ever since India.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.477
You know, he and Kiran...

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.318
they know a fair bit about pressure
from their parents, too.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.154
I guess we all do.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.874
From what Johnny said, er,
I hear your mother's no different.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.793
Yeah.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.910
Well, I don't know
what Johnny told you,

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.431
but my mom's probably not
the best judge on marriage.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.039
I think sometimes the only reason that my
parents stayed together as long as they did

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.038
was... cos they lived
in separate countries.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.557
You know, I wanna marry someone
I can't wait to see every day.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.518
You know, we're not gonna
get any sleep in these chairs.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.758
Get used to it.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.794
And take your arm off my arm-rest
and keep your leg to your side.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.192
# Hey, must be the money!

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.151
# If you wanna go and get high wit me

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.475
# Smoke an L in the back of the Benz-y

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.114
# Oh, why must I feel this way?

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.276
# Hey, must be the money!

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.514
Welcome.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.879
Oh, hello.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.150
# Hey, must be the money!

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.111
# Must be the money!

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.038
It's all good.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.036
And this is the
en-suite bathroom.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.719
This one has hot-tub bath
with super-jets.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.675
Oh, oh, you must see this closet.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.631
Just look at the space.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.309
Chandra has this entire side
for all her 51 wedding suits.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.395
51.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.510
And that's gonna be the gym.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.596
And that's my crib.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.239
Very nice, Kholi saab.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.191
I know what you're thinking.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.151
But he's a good man.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.395
I'm not romantic like you, Lalita.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.791
I didn't want to take the chance
in case my prince never came.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.913
I know he's not for you, but...
but he's kind and...

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.951
and adores me.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.831
And I love it here.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.756
Chandra, I'm truly happy for you.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.476
I... I think I was a bit
too quick to judge him.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.312
I'm sorry.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.828
It's fine.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.230
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, Kholi saab, it's lovely.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.635
The ceiling is so ornate.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.750
To think my wedding's
going to be here!

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.676
Just put those figures
on my desk.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.472
Oh, here we go.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.475
Hi.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.953
Hey.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.911
- Mr Darcy.
- Hello, everyone.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.191
Good afternoon, sir.
Isn't it great we're all together again?

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.119
Er, only this time we have
home-court advantage, no, sir?

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.551
OK, come on,
I'll show you around.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.033
- Please.
- Mama.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.513
Come, come. Come, Beta.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.999
Mmm, that's very good, Paul.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.270
Excellent.
I'll put the order in today.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.673
Mmm.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.597
Mmm, Will!

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.913
Mother.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.351
I'd like you to meet
the Bakshi family.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.551
So these are Kholi's relatives?

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.318
Such a pleasure
to meet you, madam.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.078
And your lovely hotel.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.429
It's, er, first class.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.436
So tell me everything
about India.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.311
I've always been
fascinated by it.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.636
India is such a huge country,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.711
It's always been a dream of mine,
since I was a little girl, to go there.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.911
I was devastated when
Will said that I shouldn't go.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.349
Oh, that's not
what I said, Mother.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.392
I said that it might be hard
for you to travel there.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.392
But you're the one that didn't
want to buy the hotel there.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.793
The Board wanted to.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.116
Oh, everybody has their hand
on India these days.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.196
But Will refused.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.515
Well, that was
for lots of reasons.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.429
In fact, it was Lalita who helped me
make that decision.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.391
A decision that lost us a fortune.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.679
Well, there's so much
to see in India, Mrs Darcy.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.472
You must come some time.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.590
Well, if I had a hotel,
I might have.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.757
But, well, with yoga, and spices,
and Deepak Chopra,

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.836
and wonderful
Eastern things here,

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.155
there's no point in
travelling there any more.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.430
Well, I don't know about that.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.916
People haven't stopped going to Italy
because Pizza Hut's around their corner.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.712
Yes, right.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.193
Yes.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.514
Ah, Georgina.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.835
Oh, hey, Georgie.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.233
Hey.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.918
Hey, come here.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.589
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
my little sister, Georgie.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.108
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.071
So this is Lalita?

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.269
Yeah.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.757
Oh, Will told me all about your
fab time together in India.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.473
Food poisoning, being ravaged
by mosquitoes.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.556
Not your brother's idea
of a perfect holiday.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.192
There were lots of things I liked.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.435
Well, I hope I get to hear
you play guitar.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.199
- What?
- Yeah, Will said you played beautifully.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.195
No.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.992
He's just exaggerating.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.996
No, my brother never lies.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.078
Lunch.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.237
He's one of the most eligible
bachelors in this town.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.999
You should be stirring your
husband's dinner, not trouble.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.838
- Darcy was just being friendly.
- Very friendly.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.630
After meeting his mother,
I even felt a little sorry for him.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.070
I think what changed your mind
was seeing the size of his hotel.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.196
Oh, hello?

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.754
Ah, hello, Mr Darcy.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.751
What can I do for you?

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.711
Oh, Lalita. Yeah.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.671
Well, yes, she's just here.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.914
Huh?

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.713
Here's to the only person
I've ever seen stand up to my mother.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.273
I hope I wasn't too rude.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.878
Mmm. Trust me,
it's good for her.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.795
It reminded me of when
I first arrived in India.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.311
I'm trying to deal with everything and then,
boom, you jump straight down my throat.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.998
I didn't know what had hit me.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.871
You deserved it.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.558
Oh, come on.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.759
I really like this place.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.439
It's not at all where
I expected you'd take me.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.438
Ah-ha, you see.
I told you you misjudged me.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.799
The band is great.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.911
Why don't you show them
how it's done?

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.313
No, no, no, no, no way.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.989
No, I guess your guitar playing can't
compare to your sister's snake dance.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.271
# Show me the way

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.709
# Take me to love

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.952
# Things only heard now I want to feel

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.672
# My soul caressed by silken breeze

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.029
# Whisper secrets to listening trees

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.638
# Show me that world

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.318
# Take me to love

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.593
# Show me the way

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.870
# Take me to love

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.229
# Come out, blue moon

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.071
# I need a friend soon

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.152
# To share what I feel, it's so rare

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:02.030
# Shine down on me so I can see

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:07.234
# The silver street that leads me
to the place I want to be

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.553
# Show me the way

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.556
# Take me to love

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.993
# Show them the way

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.270
# Take them to love

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.558
# Things only heard now they want to be

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.034
# Two beings with one beating heart

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.594
# For their whole lives not to part

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.312
# Show them that world

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.998
# Take them to love

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.549
# La-la la-la la la-la-la

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.079
# Show them the way

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.678
# La-la la-la

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.756
# La-la la-la-la

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:19.236
# Take them to love

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.238
# La-la la la-la-la

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.679
# La-la la-la

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.631
# La la-la-la

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.994
# La-la la-la la la-la-la

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.270
# Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah...

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.193
- Hey, how you doing?
- Great.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.719
- This is my wife.
- Nameste.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.955
- My mother-in-law.
- Hello.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.399
Jaya, smile, please.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.908
Your face looks like
a baby's smacked bottom.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.669
Kholi wants you to meet a plastic
surgeon from Orange County.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.314
I can't just forget
Balraj like that, Mama.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.157
Please don't make it any worse.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.758
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.791
Er, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.831
You look more
comfortable this time.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.519
- It really suits you.
- There you are!

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.711
- Hi, Lalita.
- Hello, Mrs Darcy.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.911
Er, I'd like you to meet
Will's girlfriend, Anne.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.712
Lolita.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.355
That's such a cute name.
Like the movie, right?

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.278
Er, it's, um, Lalita.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.072
Nice to meet you...

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.394
Anne.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.874
- Anne.
- This is so much fun.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.399
Look at all the colours.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.954
Just imagine, she would
have missed all of this,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.788
so I insisted that she come
on the plane from New York with me.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.389
Lalita, doesn't Anne look
wonderful in Indian clothes?

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.953
Oh, stop that, Catherine.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.194
She's too kind.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.958
You look lovely.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.036
Shall we go?
The ceremony is starting.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.279
...keep her, in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.673
Yes, I do.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.314
Chandra, do you take this man as your
lawfully wedded husband, to love,

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.555
honour and comfort him,
and to keep him,

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.194
in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.514
Yes, I do.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.154
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.909
I hereby pronounce you
man and wife. You may kiss.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.513
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.834
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.791
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.913
- That ceremony was so beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.554
- They both look really happy.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.038
So I guess the next Indian wedding
I'll get to go to is Balraj's.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.356
Well, that's if he and
my brother make up.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.311
What do you mean?

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.478
Well, he and my brother aren't
really talking much right now.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.839
Yeah? Why?

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.914
Um, he didn't tell me everything,
but I guess Balraj met someone in India

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.076
and Will didn't think she was right

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.634
and ended up having to talk him
out of marrying her.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.231
Your brother talked him out of it?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.475
Oh, no, he was just
looking out for him.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.398
The girl's mom was
a total nightmare.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.433
She was a gold-digger out to nail
a rich hubby for her daughter.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.198
Scary or what?

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.037
Oh, there's Will.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.548
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I gotta go.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.517
Lalita, wait.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.355
Please, give me
a minute to explain.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.470
I'm sorry about Anne coming.
I didn't know.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.751
I don't give a damn about her.
I hope you two are very happy.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.315
I don't love her. My mother never
told me she was inviting her.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.636
Look, it's not my business
what you and your mother do.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.079
Yes, it is.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.593
Look, Lalita...

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.993
...I love you.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.679
And I hated seeing you
with Wickham in India.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.076
And I tried my hardest to
forget you, but I couldn't.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.793
I know this sounds totally crazy,
my mom's gonna flip out,

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.512
but I don't want you to leave.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.637
Only you could say that you love me
and insult me at the same time.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.788
What?

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.239
You tried to forget me.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.590
Loving me is crazy.
I'm not good enough for your mother.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.998
And you think I'd want to leave my family
for you after you've ruined my sister's life?

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.951
- Hold on, hold on.
- Georgie told me.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.468
You talked Balraj out of
marrying Jaya.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.433
Yeah, yeah, I did.
But I had my reasons.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.148
- And you ruined Wickham's life too.
- Look, just let me explain.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.034
We may not have your family's money,
but that does not make us inferior to you.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.036
I'm being honest
with you here, all right?

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.469
My family are not gonna be
jumping for joy about it.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.999
I'm telling you that
I don't care.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:43.430
When I first met you, I thought you were
rude, arrogant, intolerant and insensitive.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.712
But over the last few days, I thought
maybe... maybe I'd made a mistake.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.758
But I was right.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.634
You're the last person
I'd ever want to be with.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.512
Hey, Mr Darcy.
How are you doing?

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.755
Hey, Kholi.
Er, is Lalita here?

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.756
I'm sorry, sir,
you've missed her.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.711
- What?
- I took them to the airport.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.512
They're on their way to London.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.710
You want to come in
for a beer or something?

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.354
I'll get it.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.556
It's so tragic.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.795
Not a single proposal.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.751
So sad.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.349
My fate is to live in
that rotten house

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.915
full of spinsters
and no grandchildren.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.157
- Don't worry.
- Everything will be all right.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.876
Mama... I was thinking,
can I go shopping?

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.753
- Go, Lakhi, go.
- Thank you, Mama.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.595
If we are not bringing back
any husbands, and she goes shopping,

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.074
at least we won't be
going back empty-handed.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.314
Hey, what's wrong?

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.710
We almost did have a proposal.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.796
A proposal?

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.512
Who?

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.351
- Will Darcy.
- Darcy?

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.996
I know this sounds crazy.

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.951
What did he say?

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.957
That he loves me.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.911
And what did you say?

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.191
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.276
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.639
Good to see you.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.989
- How long have you been waiting?
- Not very long.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.553
Shall we go? Come on.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.270
It's from Lakhi.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.833
God.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.111
- Darcy...
- Lalita...

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.911
I feel like I owe you an apology.

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.872
- This isn't a good time.
- Lalita, please, just...

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.637
I'm sorry about Jaya.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.797
I wasn't sure whether
she really loved Balraj.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.752
I thought your mom
was just pushing her.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.199
I was an idiot.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.073
I've apologised to Balraj
because I know he still loves her.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.509
- He'd like to see her.
- I don't have time for this.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.074
- Wickham has...
- Wickham is a liar.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.748
He got my sister pregnant
when she was 16.

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.479
And he ran off and tried to marry her
for my father's money.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.715
I stopped him and I had
to pick up the pieces.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.591
Oh, my God.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.232
- What?
- Lakhi.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.316
Lakhi has gone off
with Wickham.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.316
What?

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.954
Lakhi went out shopping yesterday
and she never came back.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.549
Mama's sick in bed. Papa's here
from India with the police.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.476
They can't seem
to find her anywhere.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.839
Wickham!

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.671
Lakhi!

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.318
Know where he is?

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.835
It's so beautiful. I love it.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.634
He left with some bird.
Said something about the London Eye.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.079
Smile.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.831
I don't know.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.669
- My God, Johnny, I want to go on that.
- Hey!

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.394
I want to go on that.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.668
Lalita!

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.759
Lakhi!

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.029
Lakhi!

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.436
Oh, my God, Bollywood!

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.198
Go away!

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.274
No!

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.350
Go away!

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.470
Johnny, there's two seats.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.915
- Darcy.
- All right.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.110
 - Lakhi.
- Lakhi, let's go.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.792
Lakhi!

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.478
Come back.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.077
- Lakhi!
- Johnny.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.190
Just... stop it now.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.116
Leave him. Let's go.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.434
Lalita.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.835
Not him. Please, anyone...

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.751
Don't you dare.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.193
Lalita, it was always you!

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.435
I'm so sorry.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.391
Let's call Mama and Papa.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.871
- Oh, silly girl.
- Papa.

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.638
Oh, Lakhi.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.716
- Thank God you're safe.
- Mama, I'm so sorry.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.034
What sorry?

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.152
No boy's coming within ten miles
of you until you get married.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.392
Mama, Papa, it's Will
who found her.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.589
Oh.

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.995
Thank you so much, son,
for bringing her home.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.191
- We're really indebted to you.
- No, really.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.390
- Lalita, help him clean up his face.
- Yes.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.510
Balraj is here.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.913
Tell them.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.952
Yes, yes, yes.
Er, there's an important news.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.230
- Your sister is getting married.
- Yes!

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.996
Oh, my God!

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.994
Congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.758
- It's a long story.
- Hey, congratulations.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.233
Thank you.

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.316
- Come on, sit down now.
- Come, Darcy, son.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.952
Come sit down,
sit down, sit down.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.070
- She's back now, she's fine.
- Hear hear.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.236
Relax.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.795
Balraj, now that we are
one big family,

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.719
why don't you find our Lalita
a nice Indian husband?

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.035
Don't you have any cousins?

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.230
That's nice.
Have a ladoo, please.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.589
- I would love to have one.
- Wonderful.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.798
I'm so happy for you, Jaya.

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.037
I told you, the moment
he saw you, he was yours.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.071
I didn't think it would ever
happen for me.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.553
But it did.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.309
Jaya.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.396
Balraj is already here.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.798
Beautiful.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.831
Agai bharat.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.791
Chalo.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.511
- Where's Darcy?
- He'll be there somewhere.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.518
Have you not seen him? He's over there.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.352
# A marriage has come to town

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.994
# Laughter, colour, light and sound

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.474
# Life is great, let's celebrate

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.239
# The sacred union two souls have found

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.233
# Can't wait for the day

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.191
# Can't keep our shoulders down

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.590
# God bless you for getting
this marriage into town

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.309
# My eyes are searching

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.475
# My hips are working

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.669
# My lips are waiting

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.709
# Take me to love

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.079
# My skin's pulsating

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.189
# My body's shaking

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.389
# My lips are aching

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.509
# Take me to love

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.675
# Payal bajake

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:15.914

# India's the place for me

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.359
# India sets you free

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.870
# Shola badan hai mera

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.278
# Badan pay sitare hai

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.279
# Akho me hai bijilia

# Le bo meh shirareh hai

# His love forsaking

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.194
# Why am I waiting?

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.754
# Take me to love

That's a wrap!

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.191
# Touch My Body

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.074
# Touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.429
# Deliver it,
make me shiver from head to toe

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.951
# Move my waistline side to side

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.594
# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.757
# Can you touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt?

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.439
# Deliver it,
make me shiver from head to toe

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.391
# Move my waistline side to side

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.034
# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.633
# What have I got to do
to get a little closer to you?

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.591
# To you

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.078
# I've been watching you,
I really wanna get to know you

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.076
# Know you

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.793
# I'm kinda feeling your vibe
as I look in your eyes

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.638
# And you're watching my thighs
moving left to right

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.591
# So what do you wanna do?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:08.518
# You come to me
and I'll come to you

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.632
# Touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.035
# Deliver it,

# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.116
# Can you touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt?

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.993
# Deliver it,
make me shiver from head to toe

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.951
# Move my waistline side to side

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.594
# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.516
# If I could be alone with you,
this is what I would do

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.754
# I would do

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.318
# I would grab you by the hand
and begin to show you

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.877
# Show you

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.309
# How to make it real hot,
never want it to stop

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.874
# Take it up to the top,
make my body rock

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.831
# So what are you gonna do?

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.273
# You come to me and I'll come to you

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.959
# Touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.833
# Deliver it,
make me shiver from head to toe

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.791
# Move my waistline side to side

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.434
# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.358
# Can you touch my body,
make me feel like I've never felt?

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.994
# Deliver it,
make me shiver from head to toe

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.231
# Move my waistline side to side

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.874
# Come on, push up on me,
I'm feeling hot tonight

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:13.876
# Now, can you rocket up, rocket up?

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.878
# Don't stop, just move your waistline
from side to side

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.797
# Now, why don't you push it up,
push it up?

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.592
# And do the body right

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.551
# Do the body right, do the body right

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.511
# Now, can you rocket up, rocket up?

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.472
# Don't stop, just move your waistline
from side to side

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.476
# Now, why don't you push it up,
push it up?

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.431
# And do the body right
