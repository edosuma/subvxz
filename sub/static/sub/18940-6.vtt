00:13.667 --> 00:16.834

00:16.875 --> 00:19.834

00:19.875 --> 00:22.709
- Heidi says that the whole town

00:22.750 --> 00:24.417
- The train station?

01:17.709 --> 01:20.750

01:17.709 --> 01:20.750
your signature.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.709
- A transfer request.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.709
- I am a proficient radio

01:27.750 --> 01:29.959

01:27.750 --> 01:29.959
David is a promising

01:30.000 --> 01:31.792

his final field test.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.709
- Krystina--

01:31.834 --> 01:33.709
- Which is why,

01:33.750 --> 01:36.375
in my professional opinion,

01:33.750 --> 01:36.375
he was not ready to be deployed.

01:36.417 --> 01:39.250
- I choose agents for missions

01:36.417 --> 01:39.250
based on a variety of factors,

01:39.291 --> 01:41.417
Sergeant. It's not always

01:39.291 --> 01:41.417
about performance at the Camp.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.625
- Which means

01:41.458 --> 01:43.625
you didn't trust my judgment.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.917
And if you don't trust my

01:46.959 --> 01:49.667
So, if you'll sign--

01:46.959 --> 01:49.667
- Sergeant.

I'm sorry, it's urgent.

He bored me to death

02:45.417 --> 02:47.583
in one phone call.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.583
- He didn't

02:47.625 --> 02:49.583
bring up his philosophy

02:47.625 --> 02:49.583
of aesthetics, did he?

The Germans anyway.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.250
No, I knew all along

04:20.709 --> 04:23.333

Two trains were listed

It's confusing,

05:13.417 --> 05:17.709

than he can.

05:30.709 --> 05:33.792

05:30.709 --> 05:33.792

07:54.458 --> 07:56.625
Here's some food.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.291
There's enough to share,

07:56.667 --> 07:59.291
but we need to talk.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.750
- I know why you are here.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.750
- Jana, please.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.667
- There's a train

08:01.792 --> 08:03.667
Monday morning.

08:03.709 --> 08:07.750
I filed the transport

08:03.709 --> 08:07.750
memorandum myself.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.333
I didn't realize at the time;

08:07.792 --> 08:11.333
it's going to the camps.

08:11.375 --> 08:14.417
We will be on it,

08:14.458 --> 08:17.250
whether I say

08:14.458 --> 08:17.250
something or not.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.709
Don't worry.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.709
♪♪♪

08:21.542 --> 08:23.709
- I'll come back for you.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.792
I'll get you out,

08:23.750 --> 08:26.792
all of you.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.875
I promise.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.708
Ahem! Thank you.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.709
- <i> Obergruppenfuhrer.</i> Was I

08:46.959 --> 08:49.709
expecting you this morning?

08:49.750 --> 08:52.333
- I'm waiting

08:49.750 --> 08:52.333
for my car's refuel.

08:52.375 --> 08:55.667
I was hoping for an update

08:52.375 --> 08:55.667
on your progress

08:55.709 --> 08:57.667
finding the Allied spies

08:55.709 --> 08:57.667
in Pruszko.

08:57.709 --> 09:00.291
- Intelligence is

08:57.709 --> 09:00.291
precision work. It takes time.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.917
- My operation

09:00.333 --> 09:02.917
is in a delicate phase.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.208
I need to know

09:02.959 --> 09:05.208
if the spies are just here

09:05.250 --> 09:07.208
to rabble-rouse

09:05.250 --> 09:07.208
with the ruffians

09:07.250 --> 09:09.208
in the woods

09:07.250 --> 09:09.208
or if they know about Marigold.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.375
- I've secured the office

09:09.250 --> 09:11.375
against an internal leak,

09:11.417 --> 09:13.792
but we're still gathering

09:11.417 --> 09:13.792
intelligence on the Resistance.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.166
If they're working with spies,

09:13.834 --> 09:16.166
I'll find them.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.709
- I imagine

09:16.208 --> 09:18.709
you are highly motivated.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.959
It's healing well.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.959
Sabine will be pleased.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.166
- I could protect Marigold

09:23.000 --> 09:25.166
better if I knew what it was,

09:25.208 --> 09:27.792
<i>Obergruppenfuhrer.</i>

09:25.208 --> 09:27.792
- I have the RSD for protection.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.000
- The Fuhrer's Guard doesn't

09:27.834 --> 09:30.000
normally take assignments

09:30.041 --> 09:32.583
outside of his protection.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.583
- They do for an operation

09:32.625 --> 09:35.458
this important. All I need

09:32.625 --> 09:35.458
from you is to find out

09:35.500 --> 09:37.458
what the Allies know

09:35.500 --> 09:37.458
about Marigold,

09:37.500 --> 09:39.917
if anything.

09:39.959 --> 09:41.875
How is Sabine?

09:41.917 --> 09:44.208
- She's well.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.208
- Keeping busy?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.583
- She's become involved

09:44.250 --> 09:46.583
with the Women's League

09:46.625 --> 09:49.750
down the hall.

09:46.625 --> 09:49.750
- It will be good

09:46.625 --> 09:49.750
for her to make some friends.

09:49.792 --> 09:53.166
- Her happiness

09:49.792 --> 09:53.166
is my first concern.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.750
- A woman is most content

09:56.750 --> 09:58.750
with a family

09:58.792 --> 10:01.542
to care for, Franz.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.667

10:15.500 --> 10:18.834

10:15.500 --> 10:18.834
- I hope so.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.333
I need to transport

10:18.875 --> 10:21.333
several packages

10:21.375 --> 10:24.166
from the Town Hall.

10:21.375 --> 10:24.166
I know it's last minute,

10:24.208 --> 10:26.166
but it has to be tomorrow.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.208
It's quite urgent.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.041
- There's a 1:30

10:33.083 --> 10:35.792
train west, out of town.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.834
Very few passengers;

10:35.834 --> 10:37.834
the Germans haven't commandeered

10:37.875 --> 10:39.834
any space for soldiers.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.625
I'm sure there's room

10:39.875 --> 10:42.625
for some extra cargo.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.667
- Wonderful!

10:44.709 --> 10:46.834
Can someone come

10:44.709 --> 10:46.834
and pick them up?

10:46.875 --> 10:49.250
- I'm afraid

10:46.875 --> 10:49.250
I'm not here tomorrow.

10:49.291 --> 10:52.917
- Hm. I don't think

10:49.291 --> 10:52.917
I can lift them myself.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.625
- Irena,

10:54.667 --> 10:56.458
do you have

10:54.667 --> 10:56.458
any cargo packing slips?

10:56.500 --> 10:59.375
I've run out.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.375
- I'll get some from the back.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.792
- I'll leave the door

11:01.792 --> 11:03.792
to Car 20 unlocked,

11:03.834 --> 11:06.417
but I need you

11:03.834 --> 11:06.417

11:06.458 --> 11:08.625
- Getting any closer

11:06.458 --> 11:08.625
to the Marigold refinery?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.750
- Not yet. But I am going

11:10.792 --> 11:13.041
to the station manager's house

11:10.792 --> 11:13.041
tomorrow to see if I can.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.709
- How?

11:13.083 --> 11:16.709
- I have a date.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.917
-: Oh. Um--

11:18.917 --> 11:20.917
- Here you go.

11:20.959 --> 11:24.709
- I'm sure I can take care

11:20.959 --> 11:24.709
of the packages myself.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.291
It's fine. He's so kind to help.

You know, you were

12:30.375 --> 12:33.333
blew up a tank at Dieppe?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.333
- No, no, no. It was two.

And they almost stole

12:33.375 --> 12:35.542
Enigma machine.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.959
classified if it wasn't true.

Because you never tell

26:56.875 --> 27:00.166
Keppler, yes.

He knows

27:00.208 --> 27:02.792
what he's doing.

27:11.166 --> 27:13.333
- Something to soften the blow

27:13.375 --> 27:15.542
of working on our day off.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.917
- Mmm.

27:22.959 --> 27:26.291
- I must admit

27:22.959 --> 27:26.291
that I, uh,

27:26.333 --> 27:28.667
was a bit distracted

27:26.333 --> 27:28.667
before you arrived.

27:28.709 --> 27:32.041
- Nothing to be

27:28.709 --> 27:32.041
concerned about, I hope?

27:32.083 --> 27:34.625
- There is always something.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.959
Spending time with my daughter,

27:34.667 --> 27:37.959
worrying as fathers do.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.583
It's been a difficult

27:38.000 --> 27:41.583
year for her.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.583
- I must stop myself

27:41.625 --> 27:43.375
from trying to fix

27:41.625 --> 27:43.375
everything at once.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.375
It's hard not being able

27:45.417 --> 27:47.542
to keep someone you love

27:45.417 --> 27:47.542
in your pocket.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.709
- Sometimes, maybe you have

27:50.583 --> 27:52.709
to push them away...

27:54.709 --> 27:56.917
...let them stand

27:54.709 --> 27:56.917
on their own

27:56.959 --> 27:58.917
to make them stronger.

27:58.959 --> 28:01.542

28:01.583 --> 28:03.959
as simple as tinkering

28:01.583 --> 28:03.959
with octane levels.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.667

33:00.583 --> 33:02.792

They won't be expecting us

I can't believe you refused

34:18.333 --> 34:20.792
to even try to save

34:20.833 --> 34:23.792

34:20.833 --> 34:23.792

34:23.833 --> 34:26.833

34:33.583 --> 34:35.500
You knew.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.083
You refused to send me

34:39.125 --> 34:42.542

34:39.125 --> 34:42.542
they were going to die.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.500
Peter and David

34:52.917 --> 34:55.500
from the others?

34:55.542 --> 34:57.750
You knew they would be captured.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.750
- Yes.

34:57.792 --> 34:59.750
The Germans found out

34:57.792 --> 34:59.750
there were two Allied spies.

34:59.792 --> 35:02.208
Faber had to show due diligence

34:59.792 --> 35:02.208
and I had to protect

35:02.250 --> 35:04.750
Aurora's team.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.750
- You sent them to die.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.834
- Faber and I had to sacrifice

35:06.875 --> 35:08.834
two discard agents--

35:06.875 --> 35:08.834
- "Discard"?!

35:08.875 --> 35:11.125
They were people, sir!

35:11.166 --> 35:14.125
- Do you think

35:14.166 --> 35:16.166
that I don't know that?

35:32.417 --> 35:34.917
I thought

35:34.959 --> 35:39.291
that if I didn't

35:34.959 --> 35:39.291
send you into the field,

35:39.333 --> 35:42.667
you wouldn't die.

35:39.333 --> 35:42.667
If I kept you close,

35:42.709 --> 35:45.709
I could keep you safe.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.500
But that is not

35:45.750 --> 35:48.500
my decision to make.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.917
- You signed

35:53.667 --> 35:55.917
the transfer request.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.625
- Transfer if you need to,

35:57.834 --> 35:59.625
Krystina, I understand.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.834
Or you can stay,

36:02.875 --> 36:05.625
take the next flight

36:02.875 --> 36:05.625
into the field. I won't...

36:07.834 --> 36:10.500
I won't hold you back.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.959
- The intelligence

36:13.625 --> 36:15.959
has been sent to Berlin.

36:19.750 --> 36:21.834
It lines up with the whispering

36:21.875 --> 36:24.583

36:21.875 --> 36:24.583
from Oslo, Bergen.

36:24.625 --> 36:27.041
When the Allies

36:24.625 --> 36:27.041
make their move,

36:27.083 --> 36:29.041
our U-boats

36:27.083 --> 36:29.041

36:29.083 --> 36:31.000
- What about the damage

36:29.083 --> 36:31.000
to your refinery?

36:31.041 --> 36:33.000
- A month's worth

36:31.041 --> 36:33.000
of repair.

36:33.041 --> 36:36.750
The important thing was

36:33.041 --> 36:36.750
protecting Operation Marigold.

36:36.792 --> 36:38.875
- How am I to do that

36:36.792 --> 36:38.875
without knowing

36:38.917 --> 36:41.750
what Marigold is,

36:38.917 --> 36:41.750
<i>Herr Obergruppenfuhrer?</i>

36:41.792 --> 36:45.041
Yesterday, I had to follow

36:41.792 --> 36:45.041
the spies to their plan.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.041
- Professor Harald Voigt.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.041
An engineer.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.458
He is working

36:52.500 --> 36:55.000
on a formula to increase

36:52.500 --> 36:55.000
the production of synthetic oil.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.041
- I thought it wasn't viable.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.041
Too expensive.

36:57.083 --> 36:59.625
- Not with Voigt's process.

36:57.083 --> 36:59.625
All he needs is coal,

36:59.667 --> 37:02.834
which Germany

36:59.667 --> 37:02.834
has in abundance.

37:02.875 --> 37:05.125
We won't have

37:02.875 --> 37:05.125
to waste resources

37:05.166 --> 37:07.125
fighting for oil

37:05.166 --> 37:07.125
on foreign lands.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.917
It will be cheap and plentiful,

37:07.166 --> 37:09.917
right here in the Reich.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.583
- That's outstanding news,

37:09.959 --> 37:12.583
<i>Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.</i>

37:12.625 --> 37:15.792
I now understand the level

37:12.625 --> 37:15.792
of your precautions.

37:12.625 --> 37:15.792
- Voigt is very close.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.125
He works almost

37:15.834 --> 37:19.125
in complete solitude.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.125
The few colleagues he entrusts

37:21.166 --> 37:23.709
only know a fragment

37:21.166 --> 37:23.709
of the full picture,

37:23.750 --> 37:26.667
and no copies exist

37:23.750 --> 37:26.667
on paper of his work.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.250
- That sounds foolproof.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.208

37:38.250 --> 37:41.208
our planes,

37:41.250 --> 37:43.875
they're dying of thirst.

37:43.917 --> 37:47.792
Full conversion to synthetic oil

37:43.917 --> 37:47.792
by winter changes everything.

37:47.834 --> 37:51.709
It is our most certain step

37:47.834 --> 37:51.709
towards victory.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.583
-: Here we are.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.583
I have them here. So this is...

38:00.625 --> 38:04.500
- What's all the excitement?

38:00.625 --> 38:04.500
- We are moving forward with

38:00.625 --> 38:04.500
our Germanization campaign.

38:04.542 --> 38:08.041
I wanted to wait until our

38:04.542 --> 38:08.041
security issue was dealt with.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.083
- You found

38:08.083 --> 38:10.083
the leak, then?

38:10.125 --> 38:12.083
- I questioned the Jews.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.083
They were uncommunicative.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.125
But I'm confident the problem

38:14.125 --> 38:16.125
has been dealt with.

38:16.166 --> 38:18.709
I had them executed

38:16.166 --> 38:18.709
yesterday afternoon.

38:22.041 --> 38:24.417
Don't worry.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.500
We won't be

38:24.458 --> 38:26.500
short-staffed for long.

38:26.542 --> 38:29.583
Plenty of good German workers

38:26.542 --> 38:29.583
arrive soon.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.750
And just in time.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.750
I had to wait ages

38:33.792 --> 38:35.750
to get approval from Goetschl

38:33.792 --> 38:35.750
for my campaign.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.583
Ego the size of a barn,

38:37.625 --> 38:40.709
sense of a mule.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.709
But protocol is protocol.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.917
- That must have been

38:40.750 --> 38:43.917
so frustrating.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.583
To feel so powerless.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.583
- You have no idea.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.750
But finally,

38:46.625 --> 38:49.750
we can begin tomorrow.

38:49.792 --> 38:52.625
There are several towns

38:49.792 --> 38:52.625
to be resettled.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.125
- Which ones?

38:54.166 --> 38:56.709
- Only Goetschl

38:54.166 --> 38:56.709
and myself can know.

38:56.750 --> 38:59.542
I find t's best to keep

38:56.750 --> 38:59.542
these operations quick

38:59.583 --> 39:01.625
and quiet.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.625
First, we pre-categorize

39:01.667 --> 39:04.000
the current occupants

39:01.667 --> 39:04.000
of the town.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.000
Anyone with Nordic

39:04.041 --> 39:06.000
or Phalian traits

39:06.041 --> 39:08.000
can be Germanized

39:06.041 --> 39:08.000
and may remain.

39:08.041 --> 39:11.667
The soldiers then come in

39:08.041 --> 39:11.667
to clean out the rest.

39:11.709 --> 39:13.625
- "Clean"?

39:13.667 --> 39:15.583

39:15.625 --> 39:17.625
