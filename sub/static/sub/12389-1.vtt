18:23.102 --> 18:26.128
Ifyou want to commit
suicide, why don'tyou
jump offa bridge?

18:26.205 --> 18:29.106
What's the matter
withyou, Mack?
This nut hit me.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.642
Don't be
a wise guy.
[ Chattering ]

18:31.710 --> 18:35.441
Driver's license? That's a laugh.
You probably don't even have one.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.982
[ Crowd Chattering ]

18:43.889 --> 18:46.824
You know, I get the funniest
feeling that somebody's
trying to tell us somethin'.

18:46.892 --> 18:50.225
I hope we find out what it is
before we kill each other.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.560
Why don't we duck into
that bar and see ifwe can't
decipher the message?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.567
All right.
[Drivers Arguing]

18:56.635 --> 19:00.969
Here, fellas. This ought to
straighten out the whole beef,
if a cop don't show up.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.252
What'll it be?
Oh, something light.

19:21.326 --> 19:25.558
Quinine water
with just a drop of gin.
Vodka martini, please.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.192
You know, we're gonna
have to come up with
some sort ofa system.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.736
Now it's a matter
ofsurvival.
Well,

19:31.803 --> 19:35.864
why don't we check
itineraries each morning
so we can avoid each other?

19:35.941 --> 19:39.069
Well, I want to
continue to meetyou,
but not head-on.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.544
Well, I tell you.
Let's divide the town in half.

19:41.613 --> 19:45.379
You take the north,
and I'll take the south.
We can talk across the border.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.386
Before we get to strategy,
I think a few vital statistics
are in order.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.719
You said your name was Joan,
and I assumeyou're a model.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.282
Uh-uh. What makes you
assume that?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.158
That hatbox.
It's a dead giveaway.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.323
Wrong.
Actress?

20:00.399 --> 20:04.199
Well, I'm studying to be,
but that's not what I do for a living.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.999
Well, what doyou do
for a living?

20:07.072 --> 20:09.768
Uh, that's my secret.

20:09.841 --> 20:14.244
Bet I can guess it.
There's really no trick to it
ifyou try long enough.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.908
Ten questions.
Okay, but even if
you do guess it,

20:17.983 --> 20:20.076
I might not tell you.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.950
Bartender, let me have
some swizzle sticks, please.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.585
No, I'd like 1 0 ofthem.
We're gonna play a game.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.737
Thankyou. Uh, could I avail myself
ofyour services?

20:39.805 --> 20:42.831
Mmm, yes.
Uh-huh.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.638
Is there any special training
required forwhatyou do?

20:45.711 --> 20:47.906
Oh, very little.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.677
Well, could whatyou do
be done in an office?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.684
Mm-hmm.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.721
An apartment?
Mostly.

20:56.788 --> 21:00.053
Uh, no, no.
Are your clients
exclusively male?

21:00.125 --> 21:02.093
Yes.
I see.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.095
Is a telephone
essential inyour work?

21:05.163 --> 21:07.825
[Joan ]
Very essential.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.770
Would what you do
bring extra comfort
and happiness to me?

21:13.872 --> 21:16.102
[Joan ]
I'd like to think it would.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.165
Are you in business
foryourself?

21:18.243 --> 21:20.609
Oh, no, I'm with
an organized group.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.580
You know you only have
two questions left.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.846
Is there any risk involved
in whatyou do?
Oh, my goodness, yes.

21:26.918 --> 21:30.479
Why, doyou know that last week,
a girl fell offthe fireplace?

21:34.926 --> 21:37.793
And you won't believe
what happened to me not long ago.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.730
The sofa caught fire.
I just got a broom,

21:40.799 --> 21:44.701
beat it out
and I went on as though
nothing had happened.

21:45.771 --> 21:49.969
Wow. Well,
one last question.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.534
Do your clients have to be
present in order to avail
themselves ofyour services?

21:53.612 --> 21:56.479
No.
Whew. Well, that's a relief.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.779
What doyou mean by that?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Forget it.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.376
I'm sure whateveryou do,
you do very, verywell.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.150
Oh, my goodness!
It's getting late.
I've gotta be going.

22:05.223 --> 22:08.351
I'll haveyou home
in no time. Check, please.
Please don't bother.

It's really quite a ways.
It's no bother at all.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.260
By the way,
I wish you a lot ofluck
on your acting career.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.927
It's a very
difficult business.
Ha! Don't I know.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.529
The last job I had
was in a patriotic pageant.
It was six months ago.

22:20.605 --> 22:24.541
I performed before 1 4,000 men
at a convention in Atlantic City.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.067
I even got
nine curtain calls.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.445
Wow. Wow!

22:34.019 --> 22:38.080
Hey, Charlie, you ever been
to one of them conventions
in Atlantic City?

22:38.156 --> 22:41.785
Nope.
You know, I think
we're missin' somethin'.

22:43.528 --> 22:47.692
It's quite late and really,
I feel guilty about taking you
out ofyourway.

22:47.766 --> 22:51.327
How doyou know what
myway is? We might live
next door to each other.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.566

up around 62nd Street.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.682

23:12.758 --> 23:14.692
What did I tell ya?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.095
So this cop kind oflooks
at me nasty like and says,

23:27.172 --> 23:31.370
"It's a good thing I wasn't
bendin' down fixin' a run
in my stockin'."

23:31.443 --> 23:33.604
Broke me up, I tell ya.
Which house, lady?

by the fire hydrant.

have to take me
to the door, really.

But I want to.
Oh.

Well, good night again.

Tom, please don't bother.
I insist on walking you
toyour door.

24:17.656 --> 24:21.490
But it's silly foryou
to climb all those stairs.
But I want to.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.188
Believe me, I want to.
Oh.

24:40.145 --> 24:44.343
Well, goodnight again.

- May I ask how long
you've lived here?
- Oh, just a very short while.

Oh.

did we?

Oh, i-i-it's you.
Um-- Ahem.

26:06.031 --> 26:10.934
I hate to leave
dirty milk bottles
in the hallway.

26:11.002 --> 26:14.494
By the way, I was wondering.
Could I takeyou out
tomorrow night?

26:15.640 --> 26:17.767
I'd love to meetyou
someplace.

26:17.842 --> 26:21.835
I think this place
is most convenient for me.
How about 8:00?

26:21.913 --> 26:24.575
Well, I-I don't
expect to be--
Tomorrow night at 8:00.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.879
Good night.

get a key?
I don't know.

27:20.338 --> 27:23.774
I don't know!
Call the police, Tom.
She's after the paintings.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.470
I'll be personally responsible
for the paintings.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.671
Somebodyjust stole
your apartment and your name...

27:28.747 --> 27:31.045
and you're gonna be responsible
for my paintings?

27:31.116 --> 27:33.243
Call the police!
I will not call the police.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.548
I'm not convinced that
this girl is a thief.

27:35.620 --> 27:39.021
I've gotta find out for myself
just what's going on.

27:39.090 --> 27:42.526

where doyou expect to live?

27:42.594 --> 27:45.995

what are friends for?

foryour paintings,
who did you come to?

I hopeyou don't mind
ifl don't make it up foryou.
That's all right.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.288
Doyou have an extra key?
Hmm?

28:11.356 --> 28:14.348
An extra key.
Oh-ho, over my dead body.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.657
Harvey, are we bosom pals?
I mean bosom pals?

28:17.729 --> 28:20.163
Bosom, yes. Key, no.

28:20.231 --> 28:22.961
Do you realize what would happen
if I did call the police?

28:23.034 --> 28:27.664
The paintings would become
a matter of public information
and community property.

28:27.739 --> 28:33.006
Now, eitheryou give me
the key or, uh, I'll have to
call the police.

28:42.987 --> 28:46.354
You bring one little bunny
up to this place, I'll haveyou
both arrested for trespassing.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.358
Me?
Yeah!

28:49.728 --> 28:51.923
Who areyou calling?
I'm gonna call my place.

28:51.996 --> 28:54.294
I cannot believe
what has happened.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.664
Hey, doyou think I had
some sort ofa lapse?
Yeah.

28:59.537 --> 29:02.802
- Line's busy.
- Of course it's busy.
She's probably calling the truck.

29:02.874 --> 29:04.808
Come and get it!

29:06.544 --> 29:10.173
Goldilocks! I feel
just like Goldilocks...

29:10.248 --> 29:12.682
sleeping in Papa Bear's bed.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.687
- What?
- Oh, relax. Milford's in California.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.519
I couldn't let Baffle
see where we live.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.550
I got no time to horse around.
The sink is stopped up,
the fuse blew in the bathroom...

29:23.628 --> 29:25.562
and we got ants
in the refrigerator.

29:25.630 --> 29:28.326
You get outta that bed
and come home!

29:28.399 --> 29:31.960
But I'm stuck here.
Besides, we have another
date tomorrow night.

29:32.036 --> 29:36.473
Be a good kid, Audrey.
Bring mywhite dress,
my cold cream and toothbrush, huh?

29:36.541 --> 29:40.375
You get home this very minute
or I'll come over and getyou!

29:42.614 --> 29:45.811
You can't just move into
somebody's apartment
without permission.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.876
It's forcible entry.
It's trespassing.
It's a criminal offense--

29:48.953 --> 29:50.944
punishable by law!

29:57.662 --> 29:59.596
He's in California, huh?

30:06.237 --> 30:08.171
Mmm.

30:08.239 --> 30:11.606
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.208
Where am I?

30:17.282 --> 30:21.013
Oh. Oh, all right.
Come on, Goldilocks.
Get up.

30:21.085 --> 30:24.179
It's morning. Come on.
Up, up, up, up.
I heard ya.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.189
I heard ya.
I heard ya.

Hey, this is the life.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.260
Whydon'tyou go in
andtub first...

30:34.332 --> 30:37.893
while I just wallow
in this ecstasy, huh?

30:37.969 --> 30:43.168
Joan, let's not get carried
away. We are trespassing.
We could get arrested.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.672
You worry too much.
I do, huh?

30:46.744 --> 30:49.338
Mm-hmm.
Suppose Milford made
a sudden return to New York.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.644
Suppose he walked
into this room right now.

30:51.716 --> 30:55.379
Would you wanna be
found here like this?
I should say not.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.978
I'm gonna go bathe
and put some makeup on.

31:03.194 --> 31:07.028
Leave mesome ofthat
hot water, willya?

31:07.098 --> 31:09.089
I heard ya.
I heard ya.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.904
- You ever meet this Milford guy?
- Uh-uh.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.202
I only sweep up the remains.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.572
Anyidea what
his racket is?

31:18.643 --> 31:21.134
I'd say he books talent
for orgies.

31:21.212 --> 31:26.115
I got news forya.
He's a jockey.
A what?

31:26.184 --> 31:28.118
A jockey.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.781
I found this
in the night table.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.290
"Ginny Frazell.
Chestnut hair. Spirited.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.793
"Good legs. Slow starter,
but great in stretch.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.022
Murray Hill 3-7599."

31:39.097 --> 31:41.725
Ifhe ain't a jockey,
he sure loves horses.
Ha!

31:41.799 --> 31:44.597
He'll love anything.
I clean up this stable. I know.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.603
Here.
Read this one.

31:46.671 --> 31:50.402
"Agnes Whitby.
Good disposition. Affectionate.

31:50.475 --> 31:53.808
Slightly nervous.
Needs two or three outings."

31:53.878 --> 31:58.508
I guess ifhe likes you,
he shoves a piece of sugar
in your mouth.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.313
Oh, "Flo Whitby.
Mother of Agnes.

32:01.386 --> 32:06.585
Superb track record. Breaks fast.
Always there at the finish."

32:06.658 --> 32:10.185
What's a swingin' jockey like him
doin' with a bottle ofbubble bath?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.525
Maybe his mothervisits him
once in a while.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.361
Or Agnes's mother.
Doyou think it'd
be all right...

32:15.433 --> 32:17.367
ifwe stayed again tonight?

32:17.435 --> 32:21.303
I've got enough apartments to clean
without adding a new one.

32:21.372 --> 32:25.706
J ust one more night?
How can you give up
that wonderful bathtub?

32:25.777 --> 32:29.941
Suppose he asks you
for a date tomorrow night
and the next night and the next?

32:32.317 --> 32:36.549
Yeah, that's true.
I can't wear the same dress
each time, can I?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.555
Now wait a second.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.230
Your stuff's on the left,
mine's on the right.
It's a pretty tight squeeze.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.266
What about
the other closet?
Oh, it's loaded.

32:49.334 --> 32:52.303
It's got fishing rods,
diving equipment,
a bowling ball.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.463
There's even
a saddle in there.

32:54.539 --> 32:58.839
Hey, maybe he really is
a jockey.
Call Agnes.
See ifshe whinnies.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.174
Ooh. It's 8:00.
I'd better get a move on.

33:01.245 --> 33:04.772
You rememberwhat I said.
Don't let Baffle into this apartment.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.249
It's about as feminine
as a wrestler's locker room.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.845
A guy takes a girl out
for a big evening, how can I
tell him to wait in the hall?

33:10.922 --> 33:12.856
I'll tell you how.

33:12.924 --> 33:16.189
You say, "Wait in the hall."
That's how.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.524
Oh, nowyou're a big help.

33:18.596 --> 33:21.997
Next time someJoe takes you out,
you have to do like I do.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.000
I tell them I live in Connecticut.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.765
Then they take me
to Grand Central Station,
and I duck into the subway.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.138
What happens when they
insist on putting you
on the train?

33:31.209 --> 33:35.111
So once in a while,
I spend a night in New Haven.
[DoorBuzzer]

33:35.179 --> 33:37.511
You rememberwhat I said.

33:37.582 --> 33:40.346
Don't let him in.
What ifhe insists
when we come back?

33:40.418 --> 33:42.978
So I'll move the sofa
out into the hallway.
Ooh, thanks a lot.

33:43.054 --> 33:44.988
[Buzzer]
Coming!

33:45.056 --> 33:47.183
Now rememberwhat I said.

33:47.258 --> 33:49.351
[ Laughs Nervously]
Hi, Tom.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.123
Uh, I'm kind of early.
Mind ifl come in?

33:52.196 --> 33:55.529
The place is such a mess.
You see, I'm having maid trouble.

33:59.637 --> 34:03.038
Yeah. We can't get 'em
out ofthe bathtub.

34:08.112 --> 34:11.047
Quinine water
and a drop of gin.
Vodka martini.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.118
Charlie.
Charlie!

34:17.188 --> 34:20.418
There's that little swinger
I was telling you about.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.127
The cute little kid?

34:24.195 --> 34:27.027
You've been in that
domestic vodka again.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.726
Take these over
and lay an ear on 'em.

34:29.801 --> 34:34.601
You'll hear talk
that'll singe the fuzz
right out ofyour navel.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.606
You know,Joan,
I admireyou.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.074
I mean, you are
a rarity.
Oh?

34:39.143 --> 34:44.739
Well-- Thankyou.
With everybody crying about
the immorality ofthe times,

34:44.815 --> 34:46.841
hereyou are,
a little Puritan...

34:46.918 --> 34:49.648
in the middle of
this great big evil city,

34:49.719 --> 34:52.484
- won't allow a man
into her apartment.
- Oh--[Sputtering]

34:52.556 --> 34:55.117
I toldyou myhousekeeper
didn'tshow up.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.026
You know that's not so.
You're just being
respectable and proper.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.532
And I commend you for it.
Well, a girl should be careful.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.898
Just recently, a fellow
took me out to dinner
and then to a show...

35:04.969 --> 35:08.336
and then got terribly upset
because I wouldn't let him
kiss me good night.

35:08.406 --> 35:12.069
Well,youstayold-fashioned.
Andas faras myinterest in
yourapartment is concerned,

35:12.143 --> 35:15.738
why, it's purely professional.

35:15.813 --> 35:19.271
Professional?
Mm-hmm. I'm interested
in things people live with:

35:19.350 --> 35:22.911
furnishings, accessories,
uh, paintings.

35:22.987 --> 35:25.683
Paintings? Well, I certainly
don't have any ofthose.

35:25.756 --> 35:29.453
You don't?
Not unless you can call
something that looks like...

35:29.527 --> 35:33.725
a two-headed man with
a three-legged chicken standing
on one ofthem paintings.

35:33.798 --> 35:37.928
Oh. That sounds very
Impressionistic, somebody
likeJacques Pirraux.

35:38.002 --> 35:41.335
They could be veryvaluable.
Ifl wereyou, I would take
good care ofthem.

35:41.405 --> 35:45.034
Well, i-is thatyour business?
Paintings?

35:45.109 --> 35:48.010
Not exactly.
I'm an interior decorator.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.483
You, an interior decorator?

35:53.551 --> 35:58.352
Why not? Is it so strange
that I enjoy chintzes and
gingerbready knickknacks?

35:58.422 --> 36:00.583
[ Voice Cracking ]
No-- Ahem. No.

36:00.658 --> 36:04.560
It's just that I never
thought ofyou in that way.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.859
Anyone ever tell you
you don't hear so good?

36:06.931 --> 36:09.991
She's a girl scout,
and he's an interior decorator.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.399
That's an interior decorator?

36:12.470 --> 36:15.871
Not only don't you hear good,
you don't see good.

36:17.275 --> 36:20.767
I think it's so exciting
whatyou do.

36:20.845 --> 36:24.281
You know, the sight
of an old Flemish tapestry
in muted tones...

36:24.348 --> 36:27.010
or a Louis XV credenza--

36:27.084 --> 36:29.644
why, they do things to me
that nothing else can do.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.656
Oh, I love pretty things.
But now that I knowyou're
an interior decorator,

36:33.724 --> 36:38.661
I certainly can't takeyou
to see my place, but I'd love
to visityour apartment.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.663
My apartment?
Mm-hmm.

36:40.731 --> 36:45.134
Well, why mine?
The answer should be
quite obvious, shouldn't it?

36:45.203 --> 36:48.366
The fact ofthe matter is,
my place is quite disorganized.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.203
I've been having
maid trouble too.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.800
I tell you what.
You take me toyour apartment,

36:53.878 --> 36:56.540
and I'll showyou what I can do
with a vacuum cleaner.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.650
Thankyou.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.912
Good night.
Oh, night.

37:08.259 --> 37:11.126
You know somethin', Charlie?
You're stupid.

37:15.600 --> 37:20.367
Oh, this is very lovely,
just not what I expected
in a decorator's apartment.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.963
Well, tell me more
aboutyour apartment.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.976
It's really quite ugly.
What doyou find
so ugly about it?

37:27.044 --> 37:31.572
Those ridiculous paintings, of course.
I'd like to toss them out.

37:32.883 --> 37:36.341
- You didn't.
- No, but I'm thinking about it.

37:38.489 --> 37:41.481
Let me freshen that up.
You know it's warm in here.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.584
I can open the door foryou.

37:45.162 --> 37:48.131
There. A little fresh air.
That's better.

37:48.199 --> 37:51.635
Uh, how long did you say
you lived in your place?

37:51.702 --> 37:54.364
Oh,just a short while.
Uh-huh.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.274
There's something very familiar
about that address.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.580
In fact, I think I went
to a party there one time.

38:05.483 --> 38:08.748
I can't recall the guy's name,

38:08.819 --> 38:11.310
but I'm positive
it was your apartment in fact.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.323
It's possible.
Doyou know who I mean?

38:13.391 --> 38:15.791
I never met the gentleman.

38:21.499 --> 38:25.492
You know, a guy dreams up
all sorts of deceptions...

38:25.569 --> 38:27.560
to lure a girl
up to his apartment,

38:27.638 --> 38:31.074
and, uh, you invited
yourselfhere.

38:31.142 --> 38:36.136
Well, I trustyou,
and that's a compliment
toyour character.

38:37.348 --> 38:41.045
Well, maybe it's that
you think I'm harmless,

38:41.118 --> 38:44.246
and, uh, that's no compliment.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.122
A man is only as dangerous...

38:48.192 --> 38:50.626
as a girl wants him to be.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.629
Say, what's the prop--

38:54.165 --> 38:58.625
What's the proportion of gin
and quinine water in this drink?

39:00.237 --> 39:04.003
Oh, I'd say about even Steven.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.906
I'd say it was
more Steven than even.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.681
Say, you're not trying
to get me drunk, areyou?

39:12.750 --> 39:16.618
We'll examine the motives
later, hmm?

39:16.687 --> 39:20.817
But later may be too late.
You know somethin'?

39:20.891 --> 39:22.825
We're talkin' too much.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.351
But ifl don't talk,
how am I gonna know
what's going on?

39:26.430 --> 39:28.625
Ifanything
very important happens,

39:28.699 --> 39:31.327
I, uh, guaranteeyou'll be
the first to know.

39:39.276 --> 39:43.713
Harvey, sweetheart!
When did you get back into town?

39:43.781 --> 39:46.249
Why, you lookjust fantastic.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.286
Just like I always say,
my place is your place.

39:49.353 --> 39:52.618
That's why I gave you
the key, you know.
How was your trip?

39:52.690 --> 39:55.955
I thought I told you--
You told me you were
comin' into town,

39:56.026 --> 39:58.927
but you never told me
what time the plane
would get there.

39:58.996 --> 40:01.829
I would've been there to meetya.
Hey,Joan, this is Harv.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.925
How doyou do?
My best pal.
Greatest pal a guy ever had.

40:05.002 --> 40:07.402
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Will you stop that?

40:07.471 --> 40:09.837
I am not going to letyou--
Isn't he a sweet man?

40:09.907 --> 40:12.842
He's not gonna let me
inconvenience myselfby
putting him up for the night.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.573
Harvey, ifyou wanna
spend the night in a dreary
old hotel room, go ahead.

40:16.647 --> 40:20.174
I'm not going to--
Come on in the kitchen.
I wanna get you a glass of milk.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.846
You must've had a very rough trip.
We'll be back in a second.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.719
I don't want any milk.
It doesn't matter.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.783
Ijust don't want to get evicted.
Look, I thought I toldyou--

40:29.860 --> 40:33.660
Shh! This is the girl
that took my place.
What is she doing in my place?

40:33.731 --> 40:37.667
She won't let me go to
my place, so I had to call
your place my place.

40:37.735 --> 40:40.169
Get her out ofhere.
Harv, I've been working on her.

40:40.237 --> 40:44.037
She's just starting to talk.
Teach her how to walk
and get her out ofhere.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.874
Look, she's ready
to spill the beans,
and she's no crook.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.971
In fact, she has no idea of
the value ofyour paintings.
Really?

40:51.048 --> 40:53.278
Yeah. She thinks
they're ridiculous.
Oh, really?

40:53.350 --> 40:58.117
Yeah. So ridiculous,
she wants to throw 'em out.
Is that so? No.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.090
Oh, no. No!
Well, I didn't
mean it that way.

41:01.158 --> 41:04.787
It's just a joke.
I want my paintings, Tom.
I want them tonight. Now!

41:04.862 --> 41:06.796
Harvey, please,
it was just a joke.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.526
The paintings are perfectly safe.
They're all right.

41:09.600 --> 41:14.060
Now be a pal.
Give me a little time.
I'm on the five-yard line.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.471
Why don'tyou check into
the Plaza Hotel? I'll pay
for everything, all right?

41:17.541 --> 41:20.601
You check into the Plaza Hotel!
Word ofhonor.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.272
Ifl detect any evidence
of criminal intent,

41:23.347 --> 41:26.145
I'll pick up the paintings
and call the police.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.811
Scout's honor.

41:28.886 --> 41:33.983
Ohh. I've been locked in
with mywife's lawyers for six hours.

41:34.058 --> 41:38.085
I've got indigestion.
I'm tired.

41:38.162 --> 41:41.893
All I wanna do is rest my head
on myvery own pillow.

41:41.966 --> 41:45.197
I'll pack it in a bag
and you can take it with you.
Oh, thankyou.

41:45.269 --> 41:47.669
Sure. Knewyou'd
see it myway.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.575
Going so soon, Harv?
Tom, you're a terrible host.

41:53.644 --> 41:57.045
Give the man some quinine water.
Makeyourselfat home, Harv.

41:57.114 --> 41:59.048
I have no home.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.018
Good night, Harv.

42:08.359 --> 42:12.056
What does he mean bythat?
Who, Harv?

42:12.129 --> 42:15.826
Well, he actually is suffering
from a terrible emotional problem.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.630
He thinks he's
a wandering gypsy.

42:18.702 --> 42:22.661
He wears bright-colored
shirts and earrings.
Even shakes a tambourine.

42:22.740 --> 42:27.143
Tsk. Poor Harv.
Listen--

42:35.185 --> 42:37.710
Tom.
Hmm?

42:37.788 --> 42:40.552
Take me home.
Home?

42:40.624 --> 42:42.558
Why?

42:42.626 --> 42:45.652
I don't think I should be
here in this condition.

42:45.729 --> 42:49.563
What condition?
Well, I don't know,

42:49.633 --> 42:54.468
but it feels good and I'd be
afraid to feel any better.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.597
Don'tyou trust me?

42:56.674 --> 42:58.608
Should I?

43:42.286 --> 43:45.778
8:00 will be fine,
Tom. Oh, I was looking
at those paintings.

43:45.856 --> 43:48.188
They are by
that fellowSchmeero.

43:49.259 --> 43:53.161
Oh, Pirraux.
Well, is he a boozer?

43:54.531 --> 43:56.726
Nobody sees things
like that sober.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.736
I'd still like
to toss them out.

44:00.804 --> 44:04.171
Tom, why do you stutter
when I say that?

44:06.010 --> 44:07.944
Okay, I'll think about it.
[DoorBuzzer]

44:08.012 --> 44:10.742
Oops. Somebody's at the door.
See you at 8:00.

44:13.751 --> 44:15.685
Hi, guys.

44:18.822 --> 44:23.020
Been rehearsing since
1 0:00 this morning.
Don't ask me why.

44:23.093 --> 44:27.530
Girl, nobody's making you
do it with whips. You don't
like the play, quit.

44:27.598 --> 44:30.158
Maybe ifl knew
what was going on--

44:30.234 --> 44:34.227
Twenty-two weeks rehearsing
and still doesn't get
the author's message.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.534
Tell me about last night.

44:36.607 --> 44:39.735
Well, he was very nice.
He-He's considerate...

44:39.810 --> 44:42.040
and, and refined.

44:42.112 --> 44:45.946
He called the play "The Onion"
because life is like an onion.

44:46.016 --> 44:49.508
Peel away the skins,
what haveyou got?
A naked onion.

44:49.586 --> 44:53.920
Now shut up.
All men are considerate
and refined the first time out.

44:53.991 --> 44:57.290
No, Tom's really different.
He's an interior decorator.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.295
[ Laughing ]
Oh, no, come on.

44:59.363 --> 45:04.426
I'm not kidding.
He loves art and frilly,
chintzy, gingerbready things.

45:04.501 --> 45:07.095
That's why he wants to see
this apartment so badly.

45:07.171 --> 45:09.605
He says he's got a lot ofideas.

45:09.673 --> 45:12.039
I'll bet he has.
Look, honey,

45:12.109 --> 45:15.203
you've latched onto
a very high-grade mechanic.

45:15.279 --> 45:17.873
He's an interior decorator
like I'm an astronaut.

45:17.948 --> 45:20.542
First he relaxes you
with the chintz bit.

45:20.617 --> 45:23.643
Then the next thing you know,
you're asking to see his apartment.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.417
I've already seen
his apartment.
What did I tell you?

45:26.490 --> 45:29.789
That's as far as it went.
Patience.
He'll get there.

45:29.860 --> 45:32.328
Look, he was a perfect gentleman.
I went to his apartment.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.490
I had a couple of drinks.
I got a little dizzy.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.729
So he brought me home,
kissed me on the forehead and left.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.400
Could be he is
an interior decorator.

45:43.474 --> 45:47.672
The authorsays
life's like an onion not only
because it's got skins...

45:47.745 --> 45:49.838
but also because it stinks!

45:49.913 --> 45:54.680
Look, why don't you
make like a potato
and get boiled?

45:54.752 --> 45:58.051
Now leave us alone.
He's coming here at 8:00.

45:58.122 --> 46:01.387
Well, just remember to keep him
out in the hallway.

46:03.193 --> 46:06.321
Maybe I could tell him
it's my brother's apartment.

46:06.396 --> 46:09.194
- You haven't got a brother.
- Well, he doesn't know that.

46:09.266 --> 46:12.133
He'll findout.
Men don't like women who lie.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.137
Besides,
you got a great big doozy
working foryou right now.

46:15.205 --> 46:19.369
That's enough.
Maybe we can stall him
until we rent another apartment.

46:19.443 --> 46:23.072
Do you realize what it
would cost to decorate one
as nicely as this?

46:25.816 --> 46:27.750
Wait a second.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.715
Wait a second.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.155
Now just what piece
ofhanky-panky...

46:34.224 --> 46:37.455
doyou have cooking in
that twisted little mind?

46:44.535 --> 46:46.594
[ Gasps ] Oh!
I just remembered.

46:46.670 --> 46:49.161
I got an appointment
with my dentist in Jersey City.

46:49.239 --> 46:52.208
Well, wait for me.
My teeth are killing me.
Halt.

46:52.276 --> 46:56.178
No one is leaving the premises.
I am gonna put skirts
on this apartment,

46:56.246 --> 46:58.180
and you two are gonna help me.

47:04.254 --> 47:07.985
Mm-hmm. Oh, yes.

47:08.058 --> 47:11.289
English tailoring.
Butwearable, wearable.

47:12.563 --> 47:15.896
Your husband's, ma'am?
Mmm.

47:15.966 --> 47:19.732
Hardlyworn, hardlyworn.
He left me.

47:19.803 --> 47:23.398
I see. How long
wereyou married?

47:25.342 --> 47:28.368
Well, I-I'd rather not
talk about it ifyou don't mind.

47:28.445 --> 47:33.576
Oh, but I do mind.
You see, I operate here under
the benevolence ofa police license.

47:33.650 --> 47:37.450
Iflaccept merchandise
ofquestionable origin,

47:37.521 --> 47:39.887
I jeopardize that license
and my own good name.

47:39.957 --> 47:43.620
Well! Ifyou're suggesting
that I'm a thief--

47:43.694 --> 47:47.687
Well, you sayyou're married,
but I seeyou wear no band.

47:49.366 --> 47:52.802
Or could it be that
the vows were never spoken?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.805
Oh, pity.

47:55.873 --> 47:59.673
You're in difficulty.
But the shame is not in loving unwisely.

47:59.743 --> 48:04.339
The shame rests on him
who'd sip the nectar, you might say,

48:04.414 --> 48:07.508
and take flight before
the blossom has fruited.

48:08.919 --> 48:10.853
Mr. O'Shea!

48:10.921 --> 48:13.321
What is it, girl?
Oh, I'm afraid thatyou have--

48:13.390 --> 48:17.087
Oh, don't be afraid, child.
Have courage.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.288
After all, it's the most natural,
sacred of miracles.

48:21.632 --> 48:25.864
I, uh, I'll lend you
a hundred dollars on the lot.

48:25.936 --> 48:28.029
In spite ofthe tailoring.

48:39.316 --> 48:42.285
Uh, you're sure
you won't sell them?

48:42.352 --> 48:45.412
Still hoping
the rascal will return.

48:45.489 --> 48:48.856
They rarely do.
They rarely do.

48:48.926 --> 48:53.226
No, no, you make
a new life foryourself,
develop an interest.

48:53.297 --> 48:56.892
Haveyou any musical ability?
No, sir.

48:56.967 --> 49:01.404
Oh, here. Plunk on this
to while away the days.

49:01.471 --> 49:04.668
And when the time comes,
I'll have a perambulator foryou.

49:04.741 --> 49:08.802
Watch your step now
as you go out. You've got
to take great care ofyourself.

49:08.879 --> 49:10.813
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

Ah, they can't fool O'Shea.

49:28.332 --> 49:31.733
Call me at the Plaza
as soon as you find out.
Harvey, will you relax?

49:31.802 --> 49:34.669
The paintings are all right.
Call me anyway.

Look, it's now 7:00.
I'm gonna push the watch
up to 8:00.

She can't possibly
leave me in the hall
for a whole hour.

49:40.877 --> 49:43.812
She's gotta ask me in.
Talk toyou later.
Mmm, yeah.

Well, hi, Tom.
Hi.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.529
What areyou doing here
so early?
Early?

50:09.606 --> 50:11.836
We did make it
for 8:00, didn't we?

50:11.908 --> 50:15.901
But it's only 7:00.
7:00?

50:15.979 --> 50:20.006
Well, it is racing a bit.
I guess I am early. Sorry.
I'll just wait out here.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.381
Don't be silly.
Come on in.

50:23.754 --> 50:25.688
Well, come on!

50:44.674 --> 50:47.040
Uh, Tom? This is Luther.

50:47.110 --> 50:50.443
Hi, neighbor.
Luth, will you get
my guest a drink?

50:50.514 --> 50:53.415
I'll just be one minute.
What areyou drinkin'?

50:53.483 --> 50:55.747
Uh, uh, uh, nothing.
Thankyou.

50:55.819 --> 50:58.083
You name it, we've got it.

50:58.155 --> 51:01.591
Uh, ifyou don't mind,
I'll just browse around.

51:06.396 --> 51:09.422
How are they getting along
out there?

51:09.499 --> 51:12.229
Okay, I guess.
I'd sure like to meet the guy,

51:12.302 --> 51:15.237
but I look like I been workin' out
with the Green Bay Packers.

51:20.343 --> 51:23.574
- He's cute, isn't he?
- Not from this angle.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.343
He can walk, can't he?

51:28.418 --> 51:31.683
Sure.
You betterwatch yourself
with this guy.

51:31.755 --> 51:34.189
He's gotta be a wolf
from what I can see.

51:38.895 --> 51:42.353
Tom, what's the trouble?
Oh, no trouble.
No trouble at all.

51:42.432 --> 51:45.424
I was just checking
the upholstery. It's fine.
Very fine indeed.

51:45.502 --> 51:49.131
Oh. Well, I'm all ready.
What's on the agenda?

51:49.206 --> 51:52.972
I thought we'd catch a movie,
then I'd takeyou for a bite to eat...

51:53.043 --> 51:58.709
and then I'd like to talk toyou
about some exciting ideas I have
for redoing my apartment.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.716
Wonderful.

52:03.887 --> 52:07.448
I don't know about that guy.
What's he look like toyou?

52:07.524 --> 52:09.458
Just another pretty face.

52:18.668 --> 52:21.899
Ifthere's one thing
I cannot stand,
it's a clean Italian movie.

Luigi Brocatelli
always plays such a wolf.

an 80-year-old shoemaker.

a good spaghetti place.

Whereyou been hidin'?
- At the office. Been very busy.

Hey, let's go someplace.
Dressed like this?

- Really, some other time, huh?
- You're close by.
How aboutyour place?

How aboutyour place?

The painters are coming tomorrow.
The whole joint's torn up.

Howaboutyourplace, Tom?

53:01.211 --> 53:04.942
Well, I'd love to haveyou,
but the woman next door
is very sick...

53:05.015 --> 53:08.007
and the doctors are
coming in and going out.

53:08.084 --> 53:11.076
It's terrible. I'll giveyou a call
next week, all right?

53:11.154 --> 53:13.918
It was nice to seeyou.
Good night.
Good night.

53:13.990 --> 53:17.391
Gee, I'm awfully sorry
about not having you
over to my place.

53:17.460 --> 53:21.191
I have an idea.
Why don'tyou all
come over to my place?

53:24.167 --> 53:26.101
Why didn't I think ofthat?

53:27.938 --> 53:30.566
FourScotches, one vodka.
Make that two--

53:30.640 --> 53:34.599
The least you could do
is come out and say hello.
I will not go out and say hello.

53:34.678 --> 53:37.647
I just told them we'd stop here
on the way to Joan's place.

53:37.714 --> 53:41.480
So take 'em
to Joan's place!
Joan has no place.

53:41.551 --> 53:45.487
My place is her place.
I couldn't take 'em to my place
because your place is my place.

53:45.555 --> 53:49.616
This gang knows my place,
so I had to come to your place.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.832
I am seriously thinking
of destroying myself.

54:00.904 --> 54:05.136
What will you do when
I'm no longer here? Will you
move me out ofthat place too?

54:05.208 --> 54:09.542
Harvey, don't be bitter.
You know it pains me
to do these things.

54:09.613 --> 54:13.174
I told you to call the police days ago.
I'm worried about my paintings.

54:13.250 --> 54:17.084
Well, stop worrying.
I'll find them.
You'll find them?

54:17.153 --> 54:20.316
I didn't mean that.
Theywere temporarily
removed for safety's sake.

54:20.390 --> 54:24.349
They should be back--
What happened
to my paintings, Tom?

54:24.427 --> 54:27.225
Nothing. Believe me, they're safe.

but as far as being lost--
Where are my paintings?

Oh, all I want
is a good night's sleep.

55:19.949 --> 55:23.578
A good night's sleep
and my oil paintings.
Is that asking too much?

55:23.653 --> 55:26.850
No, I thinkyou're
being very reasonable.

to be ofsome help.

You just stay away, that's all.

Youjust handedme
mytrousers, right?

55:47.577 --> 55:49.772

and go over there.

Why are we running?
We don't even know the apartment.

the penthouse,

you miserable, depraved beast.

Wait a second.
This doesn't look like the--

57:07.157 --> 57:11.753
All you had to do was
lift a phone at the hotel.
You can do that from any position.

57:11.828 --> 57:14.353
We were having
so much fun, who bothered
to look at the clock?

57:14.431 --> 57:19.368
Doyou realize we called
every place in town,
including the morgue?

57:19.436 --> 57:23.202
By the way,
ifTom was with you,

57:23.273 --> 57:26.003
who did Luther
punch in the face?

57:26.075 --> 57:30.409
Must have been Tom's friend.
He went back to sleep
at Tom's apartment.

57:30.480 --> 57:34.610
Oh, well, anyone who's
stupid enough to answer the door
at 4:30 in the morning...

57:34.684 --> 57:36.743
deserves a punch in the face.

57:36.820 --> 57:40.347
I-It's getting pretty serious
between Tom and me.

57:40.423 --> 57:45.224

Takes me longer to
break in a pair ofshoes.

last night I wanted
to tell him the truth,

to Mother Audrey. Don't.

to roast a duck?

Oh, that's pretty good. Ask me
ifl can roast a cottage cheese,
I might helpyou.

Well, Tom's favorite dish
is duck l'orange, so I
invited him up for dinner.

in your head?

I couldn't tell him
I can't cook.
Why couldn'tyou tell him?

58:21.698 --> 58:25.794
All you have to say
is "I can't cook." That means,
quote, "I can't cook," unquote.

deeper and deeper.

make a decent duck l'orange.

about my securities and the boat.

accuse me ofthings like that.
- You're in love with that girl.

is a person insane.

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:49.454
What are the charges?
No, no charge.
Glad to be ofhelp.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:52.926
Thankyou, Mr. O'Shea.
Ifl might make
a suggestion,

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:56.829
now that he's back,
you run him down to city hall
and get a licence.

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:59.663
There's something
I must tell you.

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:03.569
Tell me nothing.
The child's got to have a name.

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:06.403
I am not going
to have a child!

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:09.535
Well, don't tell him
'til afterthewedding.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.637
You get the certificate.
It's a permanent credit card.

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.648
You listen to O'Shea.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:21.622

right afteryou left.
Oh.

Hello?
Oh, hello, Tom.

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:31.318
No, I just stepped out
for a minute.

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:35.853
Um, Tom, I was wondering
ifwe should be seeing
each other again.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.134
Well, there are many reasons.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:45.105
Oh, no, you've been very nice
and I've enjoyed being with you.

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:50.338
Oh, I do, I do.

Oh, Tom.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:06.324
You mean, he shuttled in
and shuttled out again?

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.863
Must we go through
all the details, Mr. O'Shea?

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:11.923
You can't have him
running in and out like the tides.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.434
You'll wearyourself out
carrying the suits.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:17.438
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Never mind the money.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:21.670
Just hold the suits for me, huh?
Doyou love the man?

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.974
Mr. O'Shea, there is no man.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:28.039
I see.
You want to forget him.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.244
Good riddance it is.
So, now I can tell you.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.948
Good-bye, Mr. O'Shea.
There's anotherwoman.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.694
What did you say?

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.925
I found this in one
ofthe pockets the first
timeyou came in.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:48.493
I didn't want to upsetyou,
so I slipped it to one side.

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.970
Well, that's Tom.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:57.543
That's Tom!
That's Tom Milford!

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.808
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.873
Oh, I just want to die.

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:06.045
Oh, I am so embarrassed.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:09.147
I-I-I just want to die!

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:12.794
Why didn't the bum say something,
not string you along?

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:16.797
All that changed hands
was some quininewater
and a roast duck.

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:21.802
Because hewanted me to look
like the biggest idiot that
ever came out ofthewest.

Orthe north, south
and east. And Canada!

Ifhe had one shred
of decency,

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.645
hewould have never
led me on.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.647
Any gentleman
would have spoken up...

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.876
the minute I brought him
back to his apartment.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:39.648
Only a lying, sneaky,
deceitful snake would
do that to a girl!

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:43.657
Yeah, when all you did
was steal his apartment
and hock all his clothes.

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.660
Why didn't he stop me?
Why did you start it?

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.662
Don't change the subject.

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.664
Give me a hand
with these slipcovers.

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:54.964
He is not gonna get awaywith it,
you understand me?

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:57.972
Joanie, sit down, hmm?

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.908
Doyou know thatyou
could get six months for this?

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:06.539
Jail! Pokey-pie!
You should be grateful
he didn't blow a whistle.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.640
Oh, he wouldn't dare!

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:13.950
He wouldn't dare, because
I can prove he led me on
for immoral purposes!

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:18.482
You didn't tell me about that.
When did it happen?

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.994
It didn't, but he was
getting around to it!

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:24.260
Areyou gonna help me?
I am not leaving
this apartment.

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:27.392
He humiliated me,
and he is not gonna
get awaywith it.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:30.404
I'm from Iowa.
What's that got to dowith it?

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:34.465
I don't know, but he's
gonna rue the day he
toyed with Joan Milford.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.477
Your name is Howell,
remember?

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.945
Howyou gonna
get him to rue?
I'll think ofsomething.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.948
Then you're gonna keep
your date tonight?

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:42.950
Ooh, I can'twait.

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:47.284
He mayjust give me the clue
on the bestwayto rue.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:56.758
It hardly seems possible
we've known each other
less than two weeks.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.062
I feel like I've
known you forever.

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:02.900
And yet we really know
very little about one another.

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.905
What more do you have to know?

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:08.272
Oh, things like
your ideas and such.

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:10.277
At 2:30 in the morning?

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:12.609
It's a heck of a time
to exchange ideas.

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.945
You know, you once told me,

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:18.816
the most important quality
in a woman was honesty.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.355
What doyou think the most
important quality in a man is?

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:24.790
Same thing-- honesty.
Honesty in anybody.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.455
And doyour friends
consideryou an honest man?

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.794
I like to think so.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:34.802
You must have such exciting friends,
especially among the women.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.168
No, I'm actually
a lonelyman.

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:40.538

is mywork.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.169
Splashes of colors
or beautiful fabrics,

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.179
ora well-turned
piece ofwood--

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.681
those are the things
that can thrill me.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:50.309
I'm really quite an artist.

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:54.048
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, you certainly are
quite an artist.

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:56.056
But, you know,

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.058
you should have
more friends.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.060
I haveyou.
What more do I need?

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.494
What doyou say
I have a party foryou?

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:05.294
We have each other.
That's plenty, isn't it?

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.460
But I'm not really
very exciting,

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.505
and I can introduceyou
to a lot ofinteresting people.

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:14.030
Mmm,
I'm very uncomfortable
around people.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.703
Well, Tom, my mind's made up.

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.110
I'm gonna invite
a few friends over Friday night,

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.172
and we can have
a few drinks and dance,

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.183
and I'll get
some sandwiches in.

would doyou good.

then I'm for it.

A "Streets of Paris" party.

All the girls
are coming dressed...

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.724
as their favorite women
ofthe boulevard.

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.670
Oh, fine.
Oh, and, Agnes,

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:20.469
it's a surprise party,
so don't call Tom back.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.401
All righty.
Good-bye, Agnes.

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:27.915
What'reyou trying
to do,Joan?

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.816
This is national
rue week, remember?

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.013
But what point areyou
trying to make?

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:36.455
This is a man who demands
honesty in his women.

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:40.358
I justwant to show him
that it's a pretty good
virtue in men too.

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:42.862
"I'm so alone,Joan.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:47.027
I'm so uncomfortable
around women."

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:50.868
You're going to an awful
lot oftrouble for a guy
you're supposed to hate.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.244
You want a lift home?

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.246
No. I'm gonna
hang around and do
a little thinking.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.248
Good afternoon,

What doyou want
to think about?

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.483
Joan. Suddenly,
she's very important to me.

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.491
I'm awfully fond ofthat girl.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:14.585
I don't dig it.
You know she's been one long lie.

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:18.121
No, her only crime has been
trying to impress me.

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:22.295
No matter howyou rationalize,
she's trespassing.

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.565
That's morally and legallywrong.

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:27.836
Well, what about a man
who conceals assets...

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:31.242
that morally and legally
are not completely his?

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:35.409
- Such as a nice collection
of oil paintings?
-Well, then.

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:38.509
She's throwing a little
partyfor me tonight.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:42.682
I told her I didn't have manyfriends.
I was kind ofa hermit.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:45.021
That must have been
a verytouching scene.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:48.062
Harvey, I feel like a heel.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.620
For two weeks now,
I've been spiking her drinks,

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:54.999
playing on her sympathies,
lurking around just waiting
to take advantage.

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.538
Would you want somebody
to do that toyour sister?

01:22:57.605 --> 01:23:00.540
I sure would.
My sister's single and pushing 40.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:04.977
I'm gonna tell herwho I am
and forgive her forwhat
she's done.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.571
I don't carewhatyou do,
just come backwith my paintings.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:13.115
Why don'tyou come along
with me and pick up
the paintings yourself?

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:16.055
After all, you've been involved
in this from the beginning.

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:18.058
Could be a lot oflaughs.

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.060
Could just be a lot oflaughs.

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:16.306
Must be old home week.

is this without men?

Be patient.
You know Tom's always
full ofsurprises.

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.314
He never surprised me.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.976
Look at the one at the table--

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:53.020
the one stuffing her face
with the tuna fish sandwiches.

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.926
That's gotta be Ginny Frazell.

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:02.622
Slow starter
but great in the stretch.

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:05.393
That's right, Chief,
dozens of'em.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.401
I can't figure it, either,

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:11.132
unless the Seventh Fleet's
steamin' down Madison Avenue.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.640
What'reyou gonna do
when the man finally shows up?

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.650
I don't have to do anything.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:26.346
I just want him to see me.
He'll get the message.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.889
Chief, I counted 50.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.982
Must be a national
convention.

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.550
Just a second.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:36.028
Two male individuals
just arrived.

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:38.531
I can't see their faces.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.838
But they ain't here
to read the gas meters.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:48.239
Yeah, yeah.
Better charter a bus.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.479
Well, it looks like
they're all here.

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:54.174
I wish he'd hurry.
I'm getting worried.

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.945
What areyou worried about?

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.952
I don't know.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.954
But with all this talent
and no place to put it,

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:03.354
something's gotta give.

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:07.292
That's funny.
I could have sworn
she said a few friends.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:09.296
Sounds like a few dozen to me.

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.298
That's what I mean
about this girl.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.300
She's so concerned
for mywelfare.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:16.201
Imagine going to
all this trouble and expense.

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:20.230
I just hope there's someway
I can repay her. Well--

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.936
Hi.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.312
[ All Chattering ]

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:31.443
Where's the other fellas?
There's only two ofyou.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:38.149
I'll grab the paintings
and meetyou in the car.

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:50.904
What is this?

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:53.406
Welcome toyour party,
Mr. Milford.

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:57.433
I just thoughtyou might enjoy
being surrounded bythe, uh,

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.946
things you love best.

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:02.847
I was on myway to
clear up this whole mess.

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.351
You're a little bit late.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.787
A girl takes me to my own apartment,
tells me it's hers.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.949
I couldn't get over
the shock for a week.

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:13.619
That still leaves
one week unaccounted for.

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:17.756
You deliberately led me on to
humiliate me, and you have. Good-bye.

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.323
Now, listen.
Step aside, please.

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:23.802
Could we be alone, please?

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.806
Oh, sure.
What did you have in mind?

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.808
I meantJoan.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:32.073
You stay right here, Audrey.

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:35.980
I have as much right
to be offended as you do.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.986
I knew what I was doing was wrong,
but my motives were good.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.522
I met a man I liked,
and I wanted to impress him.

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:45.081
Butyou lied to me
foryour own evil purposes!

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:47.684
Ifl say I loveyou?

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.359
I-I-I suggestyou scratch
this horse, Mr. Milford.

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:57.370
It's shy, nervous and refuses
to enter the starting gate.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.497
Now,you're talkin'about lies.

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.508
How about your lies to me?

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:04.602
Didn't you tell me you were
a very good cook, huh?

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:07.705
You know you didn't cook
that duck dinner.
I tried.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:12.082
Can you hear
what he's sayin'?

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:16.590
He sounds disappointed because
she didn't make him a duck dinner.

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:21.962
What about the other one
that's playing cards on the bed?

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:26.265
I'm still workin'
on the duck dinner.

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.903
I have to leave.
No, really.

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.906
Harvey.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:35.374
No, you can't leave,
Harvey.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.377
Please.
I've got an appointment.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:40.243
You don't have to.
Yes, I have to.

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:51.418
Uh, whereyou
goin', sir?
Home.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:54.825
We have one stop
to make first.
Into the wagon.

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:57.296
I don't know anything
about those people.

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.890
I'm a responsible businessman.
I just came for my paintings.

01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:01.901
Into the wagon.

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:04.733
Please, Sergeant, I've never seen
those people before in my life.

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:08.242
See, mywife, Leona,
she's asking an awful lot of money.

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:11.005
Anyway, I was keeping my paintings
up at Tom's place,

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.013
and I was staying
in my beautiful apartment,

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.709
and then he asked me to
check into the Plaza hotel, which I did.

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:18.980
I was gonna call you fellas,
but this girl kept ordering martinis,

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:22.147
and then when my zipper got stuck--
In the wagon.

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:26.489
Oh, all right, I'll get in there.
Just push a little bit.

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:28.529
Come on out here.

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.530
I'll haveyou broken
forthis, you goon.

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:34.034
But I told you.
I'm a secretary at the U.N.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:37.230
Wait'll my old man
gets a hold ofthat Milford.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.241
Why don'tyou
believe me?

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.743
Officer, it was all a joke.

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:46.302
I mean, it was my idea.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:48.315
I don't even know these girls.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.817
Sure, girlie, nobody knows
nobody around here.

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:53.683
You all just happen to be
waiting for a trolley car.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:56.155
In the van!

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.454
I can explain
this whole thing.

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:01.051
I live here.
They're all friends of mine.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.064
I never even got a traffic ticket
in mywhole life.

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:07.067
Maybe somebody can help me.
Officer, let me explain it toyou.

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:10.332
The whole thing
is just a gag.
You again.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:13.841
I didn't recognizeyou
with your pants on.

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.842
Yes, sir.
I'll go quietly.

Lovely evening
to get arrested, isn't it?

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:38.292
You know, ifyou like
the apartment,

I have no objections
toyour using it on
a more permanent basis.

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:47.564
That is, uh, ifyou'd like to use
the Milford name...

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:50.634
on a more permanent basis.

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:52.975
Pay attention.
That's a proposal.

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:57.108
And you don't have
to worry about tossing
away those paintings,

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:59.813
because they belong to Harv.

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:05.325
Oh, are these magnificent
paintings reallyyours?

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:08.328
Oh, yes.
I think so. I-I, uh...

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:12.389
Oh, well, I was only
saying the other day...

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:17.404
that whoever owns these paintings,
must be a man ofgreat taste
and refinement.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:19.406

Oh, really?

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.408
Uh-huh.
Well.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:26.607
I'm passin' the police station,
and these two vans pull up...

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:30.242
and unload the biggest
bunch of night flyers
you've ever seen.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.912
And who doyou think
is right smack
in the middle ofthem?

How about that?

Like I always said,
"The city's a jungle."

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.757
Crawling with vice, it is.

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.061

with the bloom ofinnocence
still on her cheeks,

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.835
comes into the place,
and would you believe it?
