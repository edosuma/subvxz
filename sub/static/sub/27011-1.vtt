01:49.526 --> 01:53.488

01:53.614 --> 01:56.032

to the point.

the Replacement Party...

02:01.205 --> 02:03.289

all over this country...

02:03.415 --> 02:06.542

with the statement...

02:06.668 --> 02:09.461
"I don't want
to get mixed up in politics"...

02:09.588 --> 02:12.924

or "I'm not interested."

"I can't do anything about it anyway."

02:19.681 --> 02:22.058

02:22.184 --> 02:24.060
Number one:

02:24.186 --> 02:26.896
All of us are
deeply involved with politics...

02:27.022 --> 02:29.023
whether we know it or not...

02:29.149 --> 02:31.651
and whether we like it or not.

And number two:

02:33.570 --> 02:36.614
We can do something about it.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.325
When you pay more
for an automobile...

his first voyage to America...

02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:23.753

02:18:23.921 --> 02:18:26.089
Have you stood
on a high and windy hill...

02:18:26.255 --> 02:18:28.924
and heard the acorns
drop and roll?

02:18:29.050 --> 02:18:31.386
Have you walked in the valley
beside the brook...

and remembered?

02:18:33.847 --> 02:18:37.016

smell like oranges to you?

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:40.269
In a commencement speech,
such questions were fitting, perhaps...

02:18:40.396 --> 02:18:43.647
but hardly the material with which
to launch a presidential campaign.

02:18:43.773 --> 02:18:46.275
Even those who pay
close attention to politics...

02:18:46.402 --> 02:18:48.653

Hal Phillip Walker...

02:18:48.779 --> 02:18:50.655

02:18:50.781 --> 02:18:52.740

02:18:52.866 --> 02:18:56.451
Summer, if not late spring,
would surely do away with all that.

02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:00.123
Well, now that summer,
along with presidential primaries,
is heavy upon us...

02:19:00.249 --> 02:19:03.626
and the frost is still there,
perhaps we should take a closer look.

02:19:03.752 --> 02:19:06.963
Hal Phillip Walker is,
in a way, a mystery man.

02:19:07.089 --> 02:19:11.092
Out of nowhere, with a handful
of students and scarcely any pros...

02:19:11.218 --> 02:19:14.219
he's managed to win
three presidential primaries...

02:19:14.346 --> 02:19:17.764
and is given a fighting chance
to take a fourth: Tennessee.

02:19:17.891 --> 02:19:20.601
A win in that state would
take on added significance...

02:19:20.727 --> 02:19:23.271

in the last 50 years...

02:19:23.397 --> 02:19:26.983

for the winning presidential candidate.

02:19:30.154 --> 02:19:32.572

at some more convenient season.

02:19:37.702 --> 02:19:40.329
But wherever he may be going,
it seems sure...

02:19:40.496 --> 02:19:43.415
that Hal Phillip Walker
is not going away...

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:45.501
for there is genuine appeal...

02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:48.504
and it must be related
to the raw courage of this man...

02:19:48.672 --> 02:19:52.550
running for president,
willing to battle vast oil companies...

02:19:52.676 --> 02:19:55.094

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.347

and remove lawyers from government,
especially from Congress.

This building
was originally here...

02:22:05.642 --> 02:22:08.186
It was made out of lumber
and plaster of Paris.

02:22:08.312 --> 02:22:10.813
- Oh, yeah?
- This whole big building.

02:22:10.939 --> 02:22:14.150
See, they built it
for a centennial celebration...

02:22:14.318 --> 02:22:17.069
and people liked this,
and they didn't want it torn down.

02:22:17.196 --> 02:22:19.488
Nashville got to be called
"Athens of the South."

02:22:19.615 --> 02:22:22.700

- Because of this building?

02:22:22.826 --> 02:22:24.702
- Yeah, right.
- That's good!

02:22:24.828 --> 02:22:27.747

This one was originally just...

02:22:27.873 --> 02:22:30.583
this was built back up
right before I was born.

she's not going to appear again!

02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:40.695

- Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.

02:23:40.821 --> 02:23:44.198

a knife in my wife's back like that?

02:23:44.324 --> 02:23:47.952
