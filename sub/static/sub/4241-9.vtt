WEBVTT

00:04.836 --> 00:06.052
House seats to sectionals.

00:06.053 --> 00:07.255
Those things are hard to come by.

00:07.256 --> 00:09.639
Scalpers are getting, like,
five bucks for them.

00:10.498 --> 00:14.086
I however, as coach of one of
the competing teams, get two,

00:14.290 --> 00:16.505
and I would be honored if
you would be my plus one.

00:16.966 --> 00:18.423
I mean, you being at sectionals

00:18.424 --> 00:20.728
is-is kind of a good
luck charm for us.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.711
I would love to.

00:22.577 --> 00:24.406
I mean, not that we're
gonna need any talismans.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.420
I have a killer set list planned.

00:26.421 --> 00:27.698
First... no, let me guess.

00:27.954 --> 00:29.861
Finn and Rachel are gonna
do a ballad, right?

00:29.862 --> 00:30.971
Followed by the kids joining in

00:30.972 --> 00:33.413
with a classic rock number
where Mercedes will belt out

00:33.414 --> 00:34.976
the last jaw-dropping note.

00:34.977 --> 00:36.154
Have you been going
through my desk?

00:36.155 --> 00:37.250
It's what you always do.

00:37.251 --> 00:39.560
Every team tries to showcase
their strongest players.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.421
Look, just seeing your kids
do the rocky horror thing

00:41.422 --> 00:44.288
really reminded me of how much
talent you've got in Glee club.

00:44.721 --> 00:46.593
Quinn has a beautiful voice,

00:46.594 --> 00:48.526
and Mike Chang has
dance moves that are

00:48.527 --> 00:49.891
to die for.

00:49.892 --> 00:50.803
Look, I'm sure that you know

00:50.804 --> 00:53.052
what you're doing;
I'm not saying that.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.144
Everyone has picked you as
favorites for sectionals,

00:55.145 --> 00:56.794
you won your sectional last year.

00:57.028 --> 00:59.461
It's just, I don't know, you
guys used to be the underdogs.

00:59.462 --> 01:01.729
Now you're a real team,
which is wonderful.

01:02.183 --> 01:03.963
You're a constellation of stars.

01:04.393 --> 01:05.811
I would just hate to think

01:05.812 --> 01:07.800
that you might be
ignoring some of them

01:08.241 --> 01:11.179
because they don't burn
quite as obviously bright.

01:13.997 --> 01:15.195
I've said too much.

01:15.382 --> 01:16.266
No.

01:18.394 --> 01:19.658
You said just enough.

01:21.025 --> 01:22.904
Mr. Schuester,
I have an announcement.

01:22.905 --> 01:24.648
I've selected the
perfect moving ballad

01:24.649 --> 01:27.334
for Finn and I to sing to launch
our performance at sectionals.

01:27.335 --> 01:29.269
Me first. Two things:

01:29.270 --> 01:30.685
First, our competition
at sectionals

01:30.686 --> 01:32.277
are your classic stool choirs.

01:32.278 --> 01:34.435
Great voices, but they don't move.

01:34.436 --> 01:35.328
Now, if we're gonna beat them,

01:35.329 --> 01:38.008
we need to do what
they can't: Dance.

01:38.281 --> 01:40.111
Which is why I've
decided to feature

01:40.112 --> 01:43.385
Brittany and Mike Chang's sweet
moves in our performance.

01:43.386 --> 01:45.812
Wait, they're gonna dance in
front of me while I sing my solo?

01:45.813 --> 01:47.776
You're not getting a solo for
this competition, Rachel.

01:47.938 --> 01:50.523
Finally. So what song
do I get to sing?

01:50.524 --> 01:52.982
I was thinking that the winners
of our duets competitions

01:52.983 --> 01:54.227
would take the leads.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.743
Ken and Barbie?

01:55.744 --> 01:57.748
A-are you trying to throw this?

01:57.749 --> 02:00.160
You used to be just sort
of unlikable, but now

02:00.161 --> 02:01.728
I pretty much feel
like punching you

02:01.729 --> 02:03.690
every time you open your mouth.

02:03.834 --> 02:06.094
Okay, listen,
I have talked the talk

02:06.095 --> 02:08.751
about everyone in here feeling
special for over a year now,

02:09.168 --> 02:11.117
but, frankly,
I haven't walked the walk.

02:11.118 --> 02:13.224
I mean, we have got a
lot of talent here,

02:13.506 --> 02:14.442
and I'm gonna highlight it.

02:14.443 --> 02:15.392
Do something!

02:15.453 --> 02:17.963
Look, I'm all for
pumping up the team,

02:17.964 --> 02:20.529
making everyone feel special,
but that's for practice.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.094
You don't take the
star quarterback out

02:22.095 --> 02:23.117
- before the big game.
- Yep.

02:23.118 --> 02:25.561
Easy to say when you're
the star quarterback.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.772
This isn't just about me,
this is about the team.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.323
You are such a hypocrite.

02:29.324 --> 02:31.009
Like you even know
what that means.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.620
It means that your boyfriend
is full of crap, hobbit.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.301
You know what,
ever since the wedding,

02:35.302 --> 02:37.149
you've been up my butt,
and I'm sick of it!

02:37.150 --> 02:38.355
Come on, Rachel,
she's not worth it.

02:38.356 --> 02:39.315
Oh, really?

02:39.531 --> 02:40.734
'Cause that's not what you thought

02:40.735 --> 02:42.328
last year in that motel room.

02:43.340 --> 02:44.538
That's right, Yentl,

02:44.678 --> 02:46.883
your sweetheart...
he's been lying to you.

02:46.884 --> 02:49.096
'Cause he and I totally
got it on last year.

02:49.097 --> 02:50.961
Okay, enough already.

02:53.033 --> 02:56.059
No more conversations about this,
or-or anything.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.913
This is our plan for sectionals,

02:57.914 --> 02:59.162
and that is that.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.552
Mike, Brittany,

03:01.750 --> 03:03.183
come on up, let's
start choreographing.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.146 --> 03:21.747
And now let's welcome the
newest addition to the warblers,

03:22.139 --> 03:23.215
Kurt Hummel.

03:33.084 --> 03:35.902
And our oldest tradition
for our newest warbler,

03:36.147 --> 03:37.299
an actual warbler.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.885
Kurt, meet Pavarotti.

03:39.547 --> 03:42.137
This bird is a member of an
unbroken line of canaries

03:42.138 --> 03:44.752
who have been at
Dalton since 1891.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.979
It's your job to take care of him

03:46.980 --> 03:49.479
so he can live to carry
on the warbler legacy.

03:50.037 --> 03:50.999
Protect him.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.507
That bird is your voice.

03:52.508 --> 03:53.931
Hey, I'll bring him
to work with me.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.510
Weekends I volunteer
at a stray cat rescue.

03:58.247 --> 03:59.536
It's at the bottom of a coal mine.

04:00.387 --> 04:01.261
That was a joke.

04:01.262 --> 04:03.297
I-I don't, I don't
work at a coal mine.

04:04.257 --> 04:05.443
Let the council come to order.

04:05.444 --> 04:07.810
Today we discuss the set
list for sectionals.

04:07.811 --> 04:08.448
Council?

04:08.449 --> 04:09.876
We don't have a director.

04:09.877 --> 04:12.312
Every year, we elect three
upperclassmen to lead the group.

04:12.313 --> 04:13.871
But don't worry, we all get a say.

04:13.872 --> 04:15.254
Oh, fantastic.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.774
I have a lot of ideas.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.587
Warblers, if I may?

04:19.108 --> 04:20.980
Now, I can't deny that
the warblers' vocals

04:20.981 --> 04:22.774
are absolutely dreamy.

04:22.775 --> 04:24.439
But I believe our
set for sectionals

04:24.440 --> 04:27.422
this year should have a
little more showbiz panache.

04:27.423 --> 04:29.739
I think we should open with
"Rio" by Duran Duran.

04:29.740 --> 04:32.205
Uh, the council is responsible
for song selection.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.449
But we appreciate
your enthusiasm, Kurt.

04:34.450 --> 04:35.734
It'll come in handy one day

04:35.735 --> 04:37.507
when you're sitting
behind this desk.

04:38.126 --> 04:41.787
Now, I propose we do our
entire set at sectionals

04:41.788 --> 04:43.266
in eight-part harmony.

04:44.356 --> 04:45.933
Just tell me if it's true.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.199
I'm sorry.

04:50.504 --> 04:51.671
Okay? I shouldn't
have lied to you.

04:51.672 --> 04:53.008
I just thought that if
I told you the truth,

04:53.009 --> 04:56.143
you'd get so mad at me,
and you're kind of scary.

04:56.144 --> 04:58.340
Don't you see how it's
ten times worse now?

04:59.022 --> 05:00.033
Why her?

05:00.034 --> 05:01.468
I mean, Quinn I'd understand,

05:01.469 --> 05:02.460
but her?

05:02.461 --> 05:04.627
Do you think she's
prettier than me?

05:04.628 --> 05:05.721
Don't answer that.

05:06.585 --> 05:09.228
My dads went to couples
counseling because one of them

05:09.229 --> 05:11.229
put up wallpaper in the den
without asking the other,

05:11.230 --> 05:12.716
and they said it was the
only thing that kept them

05:12.717 --> 05:13.449
from killing each other.

05:13.450 --> 05:14.799
- Okay.
- We need your help.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.375
Uh, that's why I set up
this counseling session.

05:18.053 --> 05:19.180
You're both in Glee.

05:21.134 --> 05:22.146
Why don't you sing about it?

05:22.147 --> 05:23.344
Right? Aren't there
some great songs

05:23.345 --> 05:25.961
about betrayal or something?

05:25.962 --> 05:27.720
I'm pretty sure there's
some eagles songs.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.457
Right, let's do plan b.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.689
We'll start with you, Finn.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.306
Why did you lie to Rachel?

05:33.307 --> 05:34.483
I didn't want to hurt her.

05:35.089 --> 05:37.341
Then why did you do it with her?

05:37.342 --> 05:39.250
Why are you so caught up with
who it was? It doesn't...

05:39.251 --> 05:40.310
Was it because she's hot?

05:40.311 --> 05:41.945
Yeah, sure, she's super hot,

05:41.946 --> 05:43.058
but, um, that's...

05:45.595 --> 05:46.687
As a therapist,

05:47.113 --> 05:49.223
is it productive for me
to slap him right now?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.213
Well, I'm not a therapist, but no.

05:51.717 --> 05:54.831
Um, maybe you should storm out.

05:54.832 --> 05:55.606
Yeah.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.800
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

06:10.563 --> 06:12.881
What are you doing? We've
been looking for you all day.

06:13.229 --> 06:14.688
I'm paralyzed with fear.

06:14.689 --> 06:16.125
I've been here since
second period.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.065
I really, really have to pee.

06:18.906 --> 06:20.114
What are you afraid of?

06:20.115 --> 06:21.568
You're gonna be
featured at sectionals.

06:21.569 --> 06:22.666
You should be happy.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.006
I can't handle the pressure.

06:24.828 --> 06:26.573
I know I'm more talented
than all of you...

06:26.574 --> 06:27.903
Britney Spears taught me that.

06:27.904 --> 06:31.851
It's just, I can't have whether
we win or lose on my shoulders.

06:31.852 --> 06:33.557
B-but we all know you can do it.

06:33.558 --> 06:34.880
And I know that I can't.

06:35.086 --> 06:36.801
Just like I know the
cricket that reads to me

06:36.802 --> 06:38.871
at night is totally
stealing my jewelry.

06:40.011 --> 06:42.465
It's really too bad I...

06:43.124 --> 06:44.770
I can't give you my magic comb.

06:46.150 --> 06:47.228
What's a magic comb?

06:47.229 --> 06:48.918
You've never heard
of a magic comb?

06:48.919 --> 06:50.592
Mm-mm. You comb your hair with it,

06:50.593 --> 06:51.777
and you can't lose.

06:52.653 --> 06:53.710
I'd give you mine,

06:53.711 --> 06:55.507
but I need it.

06:55.508 --> 06:56.539
Wait.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.544
Since you're going to dance
the lead at sectionals,

07:00.052 --> 07:01.814
you win, I win.

07:01.904 --> 07:03.500
Please, can I have the magic comb?

07:09.817 --> 07:10.745
Here.

07:11.017 --> 07:12.897
Artie, thank you so much.

07:13.187 --> 07:15.167
You really are the
best boyfriend ever.

07:18.550 --> 07:19.966
We're gonna win this thing

07:19.967 --> 07:21.358
'cause of you.

07:22.498 --> 07:24.478
All I can say is I didn't
steal that soda machine,

07:24.479 --> 07:25.766
and if I did, I wasn't alone.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.090
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that I
didn't hear that because if I did,

07:28.442 --> 07:30.113
I'd be down to ten
Glee club members,

07:30.114 --> 07:31.627
which as you probably
remember from the rule book

07:31.628 --> 07:33.719
is two less than what we need
to compete at sectionals.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.154
I'm not big on reading rule books.

07:35.490 --> 07:36.832
Well, I'm not big on reading.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.135
Kurt's gone,
and he's not coming back.

07:39.136 --> 07:41.038
We need a 12th member.

07:41.374 --> 07:43.926
Now, I always go to Rachel
and Finn in these situations,

07:43.927 --> 07:46.504
but you might be the most well-
known kid in this entire school.

07:46.505 --> 07:48.468
There's a method to my madness.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.312
I want you to use that madness
to recruit a new member.

07:51.665 --> 07:54.005
Glee needs you to
be its ambassador.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.965
More like its am-bad-ass-ador.

07:56.554 --> 07:59.405
- But what's in it for me?
- You love the Glee club.

07:59.406 --> 08:01.083
We get a new member and we win,

08:01.084 --> 08:02.784
you get to keep
doing what you love.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.433
You can count on me, Mr. Shue.

08:08.118 --> 08:09.325
Hey, Kurt, wait up!

08:10.916 --> 08:13.601
I saw that Glee club
was hard for you today,

08:13.602 --> 08:15.578
seeing your ideas
shot down like that.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.208
It's just a different
energy in there.

08:17.209 --> 08:18.339
Not better or worse,

08:18.340 --> 08:20.159
just something I'll
have to get used to.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.621
We recognize that.

08:21.622 --> 08:22.980
And we have a tradition
at this school

08:22.981 --> 08:24.808
of rewarding a student
with a good attitude.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.195
So, we would like to invite
you to audition for a solo.

08:28.196 --> 08:29.228
For sectionals?

08:29.229 --> 08:32.014
For sectionals.
Sing something good.

08:34.403 --> 08:35.173
All right, listen up.

08:35.174 --> 08:36.941
Are you gonna light your
farts on fire again?

08:36.942 --> 08:38.335
Because I'm a major fan.

08:38.336 --> 08:39.532
I want to talk to you guys.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.102
About Bruce Springsteen.

08:41.102 --> 08:41.885
Is this going somewhere?

08:41.885 --> 08:43.155
Don't push me, Karofsky.

08:43.157 --> 08:44.558
You forced my boy
Kurt out of here,

08:44.559 --> 08:45.871
and juvie or no,
you're already number one

08:45.872 --> 08:47.287
on my list to go
all death star on.

08:47.972 --> 08:52.214
Anyways, so Bruce is destined to
go blue collar his whole life,

08:52.498 --> 08:54.768
but instead, he goes and buys
an old strat from a pawn shop

08:54.769 --> 08:56.296
and just starts wailing on it,

08:56.297 --> 08:58.905
starts putting all the pain and
the promises and the dreams

08:58.906 --> 09:00.724
into that music,
and the next thing he knows,

09:00.725 --> 09:03.436
he's on the cover of time and
newsweek in the same week.

09:04.022 --> 09:05.158
Those are magazines.

09:05.159 --> 09:07.809
Not to seem redundant,
but is this going somewhere?

09:07.810 --> 09:09.179
Glee club, dudes.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.216
It's time to join up.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.711
Sign up for Glee club?

09:11.712 --> 09:13.864
Why don't you come to
my church on Sunday

09:13.865 --> 09:16.183
and get some of my cousins
to sign up for the klan?

09:17.297 --> 09:18.514
Glee club is cool.

09:18.515 --> 09:20.836
Glee club is most
definitely not cool.

09:20.837 --> 09:23.806
Clearly we need to reinstate
the 10:00 A.M. slushie.

09:24.682 --> 09:26.304
I say we make an example of him.

09:26.831 --> 09:28.000
I say you're right.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.317
Get him! Get him!

09:30.318 --> 09:31.698
Not the face! Not the face!

09:32.045 --> 09:33.765
Where's puck? I haven't
seen him since yesterday,

09:33.766 --> 09:35.039
and I need him to get me a churro.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.086
My guess is he'd rather quit
Glee club than lose sectionals,

09:38.087 --> 09:39.343
and I can't blame him.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.457
Our set's gonna be real
light on the Mercedes.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.017
I'm telling you,
if the warblers win sectionals,

09:43.018 --> 09:44.423
it's only because
we gave them Kurt.

09:44.424 --> 09:45.406
We should not clap.

09:45.407 --> 09:47.010
If we lose,
we should throw possums.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.020
Rachel, what are you doing?

09:55.380 --> 09:56.546
I'm not doing anything.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.487
You've silenced my talents,
I'm merely protesting.

10:01.069 --> 10:02.494
My talents are
wasted in this club.

10:02.495 --> 10:05.207
My star shines too bright, and I
think you're threatened by it.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.591
Take that off!

10:06.592 --> 10:08.068
I'm tired of this, Rachel.

10:08.370 --> 10:09.864
You have a terrible attitude,

10:09.865 --> 10:12.056
you're a lousy sport,
and it is not okay anymore.

10:12.057 --> 10:13.230
Well, I'm upset!

10:13.231 --> 10:14.829
I'm furious about this!

10:15.115 --> 10:16.859
About a couple of things,
actually.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.247
Well, I'm sorry
you're disappointed.

10:18.248 --> 10:21.167
But you know, you could also
make the choice to be happy

10:21.168 --> 10:22.808
that we're a part of
a Glee club that is

10:22.809 --> 10:24.677
bursting at the seams with talent.

10:24.678 --> 10:26.580
There's an awful lot of
"me" talk going around.

10:26.581 --> 10:27.352
"What's in it for me?

10:27.353 --> 10:29.018
What solo am I gonna sing?"

10:29.318 --> 10:32.574
Now, when we go to sectionals,
we're gonna be good sports.

10:32.575 --> 10:33.664
We'll cheer on the hipsters,

10:33.665 --> 10:35.843
we'll cheer on Kurt
and the warblers.

10:35.844 --> 10:36.815
And if they win,

10:36.982 --> 10:38.466
we will congratulate them.

10:38.714 --> 10:40.834
Because that's who we are.

10:41.299 --> 10:42.414
Dude, where have you been?

10:42.415 --> 10:43.894
I found him in a porta potty.

10:45.148 --> 10:47.596
I was trying to find Kurt's
replacement for sectionals.

10:51.312 --> 10:54.484
I was trapped in that
porta potty for 24 hours.

10:56.442 --> 10:59.098
Buddha, Allah, Satan, help me!

11:07.092 --> 11:08.461
Are you an angel?

11:08.462 --> 11:10.055
Screw you.

11:13.278 --> 11:15.092
So I asked her if
she wanted to join.

11:15.093 --> 11:16.533
Here are my conditions:

11:16.534 --> 11:17.942
A carton of Cadbury eggs.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.294
Good luck finding them.
They're not in season.

11:20.295 --> 11:23.324
And I want seven
minutes in heaven...

11:23.325 --> 11:25.274
With you.

11:27.772 --> 11:30.390
I have to say,
she kinda rocked my world.

11:32.114 --> 11:36.033
Okay, guys, um, well, looks
like we're back in business!

11:36.457 --> 11:38.067
Let's all welcome
our newest member,

11:38.068 --> 11:39.427
Ms. Lauren Zizes.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.083
Puck, nice work.

11:44.452 --> 11:45.464
We owe you one.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.594
Did I tell you he
bought me dinner after?

12:04.861 --> 12:05.833
You okay?

12:05.964 --> 12:07.146
Why are you talking to me?

12:07.147 --> 12:08.549
Are you gonna steal
something from me?

12:08.550 --> 12:10.406
Look, after six hours
in that port-o-john,

12:10.407 --> 12:11.902
Ozzy himself would
have turned to God.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.407
I prayed. I promised him

12:14.408 --> 12:16.605
that if he got me out of there,
I'd start being nicer to people.

12:16.824 --> 12:18.358
Then I realized there was
no way I could do that,

12:18.359 --> 12:20.402
so I changed it to just Jews.

12:20.403 --> 12:21.639
It's Finn.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.027
Boyfriend troubles?
I got that covered.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.696
Considering I'm usually
the cause of them,

12:25.697 --> 12:26.987
I'd say I'm an expert.

12:27.655 --> 12:28.517
Walk with me.

12:32.622 --> 12:33.920
Have you been working out?

12:34.650 --> 12:36.049
Your arms seem bigger.

12:36.862 --> 12:37.980
It's the steroids.

12:42.207 --> 12:43.349
We have a big problem.

12:43.350 --> 12:45.104
Is the problem your outfit?

12:45.105 --> 12:46.878
Because you look like a
cheerleader zombie corpse.

12:46.879 --> 12:49.242
I have no choice.
Mike Chang likes cheerleaders.

12:49.243 --> 12:50.733
You of all people should know.

12:50.734 --> 12:52.069
He's having an
affair with Brittany.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.500
What? You crazy.

12:53.501 --> 12:55.460
You haven't noticed her
ignoring you lately?

12:55.461 --> 12:56.723
Not really. It's shark week.

12:56.724 --> 12:57.535
They're inseparable.

12:57.536 --> 12:58.805
They're doing a number
together at sectionals.

12:58.806 --> 12:59.957
- They've been rehearsing.
- Really?

13:00.393 --> 13:01.641
Just rehearsing?

13:01.825 --> 13:04.436
Exhibit a. I kissed him,
and it tasted like lip smackers.

13:04.437 --> 13:05.973
You know who wears lip
smackers? Brittany.

13:05.974 --> 13:06.793
And she doesn't mind sharing.

13:06.794 --> 13:07.933
I love borrowing her lip smackers.

13:07.934 --> 13:08.887
It's like candy for your lips.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.081
Don't be naive, Artie.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.323
She's a cheerleader,
he's a football player.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.705
You and I never had a
chance at either of them.

13:24.987 --> 13:26.998
Hey, Rachel.
I've been looking for you.

13:26.999 --> 13:28.866
Don't bother spying
on me to get a leg up,

13:28.867 --> 13:31.940
because the only solos that I'm
getting for sectionals are in my mind.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.710
Actually, I was hoping
you could help me.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.251
I've been sitting in
my car for over an hour

13:35.252 --> 13:37.120
waiting for Karofsky to
make a Mickey D's run.

13:37.446 --> 13:39.278
I've been invited to
audition for a solo.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.810
Why should I help you? I mean,
you're our competition now.

13:41.811 --> 13:43.590
Because even though
we hate each other,

13:43.591 --> 13:45.027
we've had our moments,

13:45.028 --> 13:46.777
and I could use your expertise.

13:46.778 --> 13:49.014
And no one knows how to kill
a ballad quite like you.

13:49.015 --> 13:52.367
You are as brilliant and
talented as you are irritating.

13:52.751 --> 13:54.524
Considering that this
might be my only chance

13:54.525 --> 13:58.328
to sing for a little while,
I'll give you a couple of tips.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.162
So, what did you,
uh, have in mind?

14:00.163 --> 14:02.484
I've settled on Celine Dion's classic
"my heart will go on."

14:02.485 --> 14:03.975
Oh, no. No, no, no.

14:03.976 --> 14:04.838
- No?
- Listen, you need something

14:04.839 --> 14:06.457
much more personal than that.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.760
I mean, this is about you.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.883
Do you ever fantasize
about your own funeral?

14:09.884 --> 14:11.063
- No.
- I do.

14:11.064 --> 14:13.841
Finn throwing himself into
the grave out of grief,

14:13.842 --> 14:16.246
and all of the heartfelt
speeches and the regrets.

14:16.247 --> 14:17.030
That's insane.

14:17.031 --> 14:18.744
Clearly no one in the
Glee club appreciates me.

14:18.745 --> 14:21.549
Is it so wrong for me to fantasize
about them finally realizing

14:21.550 --> 14:23.742
how amazing I am,
but it being too late?

14:23.743 --> 14:27.140
And there's only one song
that expresses those feelings.

14:28.094 --> 14:30.377
I'm sure that it's
in here somewhere.

14:30.378 --> 14:31.333
Oh...

14:33.479 --> 14:37.186
* It won't be easy *

14:37.187 --> 14:40.889
* You'll think it strange *

14:40.890 --> 14:46.568
* When I try to explain how I feel *

14:46.569 --> 14:49.375
* That I still need your love *

14:49.376 --> 14:53.766
* After all that I've done *

14:54.156 --> 14:58.873
* You won't believe me *

14:58.874 --> 15:04.428
* All you will see is
the girl you once knew *

15:04.429 --> 15:10.052
* Although she's dressed
up to the nines *

15:10.053 --> 15:17.156
* At sixes and sevens with you *

15:18.707 --> 15:26.448
* I had to let it happen,
I had to change... *

15:26.449 --> 15:32.209
* Couldn't stay all
my life down at heel *

15:32.898 --> 15:36.162
* Looking out of the window *

15:36.163 --> 15:40.395
* Staying out of the sun *

15:40.748 --> 15:45.697
* So I chose freedom *

15:45.698 --> 15:51.492
* Running around,
trying everything new *

15:51.493 --> 15:54.612
* But nothing impressed me *

15:54.613 --> 15:57.451
* At all *

15:57.939 --> 16:04.619
* I never expected it to... *

16:06.228 --> 16:10.912
* Don't cry for me, Argentina *

16:11.465 --> 16:13.030
* The truth is *

16:13.031 --> 16:16.428
* I never left you *

16:16.429 --> 16:19.478
* All through my wild days *

16:19.479 --> 16:22.266
* My mad existence *

16:22.267 --> 16:25.114
* I kept my promise *

16:25.115 --> 16:29.771
* Don't keep your distance *

16:33.101 --> 16:37.662
* Don't cry for me, Argentina *

16:38.425 --> 16:43.128
* The truth is, I never left you *

16:43.129 --> 16:46.000
* All through my wild days *

16:46.001 --> 16:48.711
* My mad existence *

16:48.712 --> 16:51.620
* I kept my promise *

16:51.621 --> 16:56.785
* Don't keep your distance *

16:58.767 --> 17:01.151
* Have I said too much? *

17:01.289 --> 17:05.063
* There's nothing
more I can think of *

17:05.064 --> 17:07.962
* To say to you *

17:12.536 --> 17:14.664
* But all you have to do *

17:14.665 --> 17:17.150
* Is look at me to know *

17:17.151 --> 17:20.579
* That every word *

17:20.580 --> 17:22.580
* Is true... *

17:40.590 --> 17:42.550
So how many times have
you guys auditioned?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.599
Three.

17:44.867 --> 17:45.811
Six.

17:47.323 --> 17:48.265
Hey, guys.

17:48.266 --> 17:49.819
Nick, Jeff,

17:50.043 --> 17:51.287
congrats, you're moving on.

17:51.288 --> 17:52.848
Oh, dude.

17:54.296 --> 17:55.368
Thank you.

17:55.587 --> 17:57.281
Congratulations. Thank you.

17:58.783 --> 18:00.125
Any sage advice?

18:02.435 --> 18:04.353
Don't try so hard next time.

18:04.402 --> 18:07.106
I didn't realize that
caring was frowned upon.

18:07.107 --> 18:09.041
I don't know how it
worked at your old school,

18:09.042 --> 18:12.295
but did you notice that we all
wear uniforms around here?

18:12.296 --> 18:14.858
It's about being part of the team.

18:15.119 --> 18:18.314
I guess I'm just used to having
to scream to get noticed.

18:18.315 --> 18:19.567
You're not going to
make it as a warbler

18:19.568 --> 18:21.363
if all you care about
is getting noticed.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.999
You're right, I'm sorry.

18:24.213 --> 18:26.865
I know it's going to take
some getting used to,

18:27.323 --> 18:28.803
but you'll fit in soon enough,

18:29.293 --> 18:30.493
I promise.

18:35.123 --> 18:36.435
How's the number for
sectionals coming?

18:36.436 --> 18:37.045
Hi.

18:37.046 --> 18:38.449
Um, yeah, it's good.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.346
Wait, do you maybe want
to see a movie tonight?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.901
Uh, I can't,
I have rehearsal with Mike.

18:42.983 --> 18:44.934
Well, how about a latte
tomorrow morning?

18:45.143 --> 18:47.649
Artie, I can't, and I can't
talk right now either.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.587
I have to go rehearse.
I'm really, really sorry.

19:04.246 --> 19:06.403
Hey. Something wrong?

19:06.413 --> 19:08.134
I'm beginning to think
my new directions

19:08.135 --> 19:10.517
for the new directions
was a terrible idea.

19:10.518 --> 19:12.685
Oh, no. We're off to sectionals,
and I have...

19:13.135 --> 19:14.925
I've never seen the
kids so out of sync.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.235
You look great, though.

19:17.236 --> 19:18.085
Ready to go?

19:18.477 --> 19:19.627
I can't.

19:20.841 --> 19:21.773
Why?

19:23.559 --> 19:25.616
I didn't tell Carl I
was going with you.

19:25.952 --> 19:28.726
Ever since rocky horror he's
had some issues with you,

19:29.083 --> 19:30.951
you know, with us
spending time together,

19:30.952 --> 19:33.108
and, um, actually,
it was counseling Finn and Rachel

19:33.109 --> 19:34.367
that made me realize that

19:35.245 --> 19:36.895
sometimes the
withholding of the truth

19:36.896 --> 19:38.907
can make someone
fellas bad as lying,

19:39.183 --> 19:41.592
so I told him the truth last night

19:41.593 --> 19:42.859
and we had a big fight.

19:43.571 --> 19:47.377
Then we made up and... then
he told me that he loved me...

19:48.944 --> 19:50.888
And then I told him
that I love him back.

19:54.828 --> 19:58.374
Well, we're going to
miss our good luck charm.

20:01.056 --> 20:02.389
Mr. Schuester,

20:02.390 --> 20:04.091
not that I really care,
but if we don't leave now,

20:04.092 --> 20:05.609
we're going to miss
the competition.

20:08.994 --> 20:10.095
Good luck. Okay.

20:10.096 --> 20:10.875
Yeah, thanks.

20:23.078 --> 20:24.912
Then go down to
7-Eleven and get some.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.504
I need raisinets.

20:26.505 --> 20:27.688
Carb loading?

20:28.397 --> 20:30.462
Puck got Lauren Zizes
to take your place

20:30.463 --> 20:33.080
and she won't go on unless
she gets her damn candy.

20:33.714 --> 20:35.416
She's a warm body.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.841
Hey, did you, uh, get your solo?

20:37.842 --> 20:38.814
Sadly, no.

20:38.815 --> 20:39.999
Oh, wow, if you didn't get a solo,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.504
then they must be really good.

20:41.505 --> 20:42.713
We are doomed.

20:43.203 --> 20:44.482
Sorry, that was selfish.

20:44.483 --> 20:47.949
What I meant to say was, "wow,
that, that really sucks.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.332
I'm, I'm sure you
were really good."

20:49.333 --> 20:51.656
I was... I mean, I think I was.

20:52.054 --> 20:53.441
Being in the warblers has
really made me question

20:53.442 --> 20:54.903
everything I thought about myself.

20:55.464 --> 20:56.263
Yeah.

20:57.119 --> 20:58.642
What has become of us, Kurt?

21:01.719 --> 21:03.592
So do you miss us?

21:03.593 --> 21:04.727
I do.

21:04.728 --> 21:05.531
Being a warbler is great,

21:05.532 --> 21:08.284
but I don't think they
appreciate my individuality

21:08.285 --> 21:09.558
as much as you guys did,

21:09.972 --> 21:11.119
and I can't help but think

21:11.120 --> 21:12.367
that I let you guys down.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.719
It's your life, Kurt,

21:13.720 --> 21:15.228
and you weren't safe
at McKinley anymore

21:15.229 --> 21:16.441
and we all get it.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.229
How come you were
never this nice to me

21:18.230 --> 21:19.468
when I was your teammate?

21:19.469 --> 21:21.315
Because you were my
only real competition.

21:21.316 --> 21:23.405
Hmm, yeah, true.

21:23.406 --> 21:24.798
Aw...

21:30.421 --> 21:31.634
So how's Finn?

21:31.635 --> 21:32.569
I feel bad.

21:32.570 --> 21:34.216
I haven't spoken to
him since the wedding.

21:34.217 --> 21:36.991
I haven't really talked
to him much either.

21:36.992 --> 21:39.099
I found out that he and Santana

21:39.100 --> 21:41.952
were romantically involved
and he lied to me about it.

21:41.953 --> 21:43.312
Wait, you didn't know about that?

21:43.313 --> 21:45.111
Kurt, they're calling places.

21:45.567 --> 21:46.077
Hey.

21:46.449 --> 21:47.426
Thanks again, Rachel.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.407
* Every generation *

21:59.890 --> 22:03.280
* Blames the one before *

22:04.805 --> 22:07.896
* And all of their frustrations *

22:09.379 --> 22:11.944
* Come beating on your door *

22:14.633 --> 22:16.504
* I know that I'm a prisoner *

22:16.505 --> 22:18.988
* To all my father held so dear *

22:19.451 --> 22:21.308
* I know that I'm a hostage *

22:21.931 --> 22:23.823
* To all his hopes and fears *

22:23.824 --> 22:26.890
* I just wish I could
have told him *

22:27.065 --> 22:31.294
* In the living years *

22:32.001 --> 22:34.969
* Say it, say it, say it loud *

22:34.970 --> 22:36.184
* Say it loud *

22:38.264 --> 22:40.632
* Say it clear... *

22:42.263 --> 22:44.283
* Say it, say it, say it *

22:44.284 --> 22:47.079
* You can listen
You can listen *

22:47.080 --> 22:50.832
* As well as you hear
As well as you can hear *

22:50.833 --> 22:54.078
* Hey, you got to
realize that it's true *

22:54.079 --> 22:55.159
* Come on, come on
Say it loud *

22:55.160 --> 22:57.839
* Say it, say it, say it
Say it loud *

22:58.773 --> 23:00.887
* Say it clear
Say... *

23:00.888 --> 23:02.141
* Say it. *

23:09.665 --> 23:12.195
And now, for our second
performance of the program,

23:12.196 --> 23:14.483
from Dalton academy
in Westerville,

23:14.793 --> 23:16.194
the warblers.

23:18.401 --> 23:19.647
* Hey *

23:20.316 --> 23:22.288
* Hey *

23:22.722 --> 23:24.942
* Hey *

23:26.040 --> 23:27.039
* Tonight *

23:27.040 --> 23:29.510
* Hey
Hey *

23:29.511 --> 23:31.257
* Hey
Hey *

23:31.624 --> 23:32.735
* Hey *

23:32.736 --> 23:33.964
* Hey *

23:33.965 --> 23:36.170
* Hey... hey... hey... *

23:36.171 --> 23:38.753
* Your lipstick stains *

23:39.439 --> 23:43.956
* On the front lobe of
my left-side brain *

23:44.731 --> 23:47.202
* I knew I wouldn't forget you *

23:47.203 --> 23:48.567
* And so I went *

23:48.568 --> 23:52.373
* And let you blow my mind *

23:52.374 --> 23:55.282
* Let you blow my mind *

23:55.863 --> 23:58.984
* Your sweet moonbeam *

23:58.985 --> 24:00.278
* The smell of you *

24:00.279 --> 24:04.516
* In every single dream I dream *

24:04.517 --> 24:06.694
* I knew when we collided *

24:06.695 --> 24:09.376
* You're the one I have decided *

24:09.377 --> 24:11.653
* Who's one of my kind *

24:11.983 --> 24:15.928
* One of my kind *

24:15.929 --> 24:18.024
* Hey, soul sister *

24:18.025 --> 24:22.010
* Ain't that Mr. mister on the radio? *

24:22.011 --> 24:22.870
* Stereo *

24:22.871 --> 24:24.264
* The way you move *

24:24.265 --> 24:25.743
* Ain't fair, you know *

24:25.744 --> 24:27.946
* Hey, soul sister *

24:27.947 --> 24:29.696
* I don't want to miss *

24:29.697 --> 24:33.384
* A single thing you do *

24:35.459 --> 24:36.076
* Oh, tonight *

24:36.077 --> 24:38.099
* The way you can cut a rug *

24:38.100 --> 24:41.017
* Watching you's the
only drug I need *

24:41.018 --> 24:42.887
* So gangsta, I'm so thug *

24:42.888 --> 24:45.507
* You're the only one
I'm dreaming of *

24:45.508 --> 24:48.414
* You see, I can be
myself now finally *

24:48.415 --> 24:50.776
* In fact, there's
nothing I can't be *

24:51.304 --> 24:53.985
* Nothing I can't be
I want the world to see *

24:53.986 --> 24:55.602
* You'll be with me *

24:55.603 --> 24:57.861
* Hey, soul sister
Ooh *

24:57.862 --> 25:01.492
* Ain't that Mr. mister on the radio? *

25:01.493 --> 25:05.428
* Stereo, the way you move
ain't fair, you know *

25:05.429 --> 25:07.504
* Hey, soul sister *

25:07.505 --> 25:12.447
* I don't want to miss
a single thing you do *

25:13.076 --> 25:14.984
* Miss a thing *

25:14.985 --> 25:15.981
* Tonight *

25:15.982 --> 25:18.435
* Hey
Hey *

25:18.436 --> 25:21.026
* Hey
Hey *

25:21.656 --> 25:24.317
* Hey
Hey *

25:24.982 --> 25:26.988
* Tonight
Hey *

25:26.989 --> 25:28.373
* Hey *

25:28.921 --> 25:31.537
* Hey
Hey *

25:31.538 --> 25:33.050
* Hey *

25:33.051 --> 25:35.997
* Hey
Hey *

25:50.998 --> 25:54.305
These costumes are causing
some unmentionable chafing.

25:54.306 --> 25:55.327
Are you okay?

25:55.328 --> 25:56.865
No. I'm totally freaking out.

25:56.866 --> 25:58.305
Last time we performed
in front of an audience,

25:58.306 --> 25:59.820
I went into labor.
I think I'm having

25:59.821 --> 26:00.903
post traumatic stress disorder.

26:00.904 --> 26:03.557
Fyi, I'm totally
available to fill in.

26:03.558 --> 26:04.822
Nowhere to run.

26:04.823 --> 26:07.052
From me or your lies.

26:07.053 --> 26:08.928
I hope they judge us on
dancing and adultery,

26:08.929 --> 26:10.570
because you're aces
at both of them.

26:10.571 --> 26:12.561
I don't understand
how you found out.

26:12.562 --> 26:15.073
I am so stupid.
I can't believe I did it.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.844
I've never felt more awful
about anything in my life.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.275
What's Artie all worked up about?

26:22.820 --> 26:24.138
You are such a jerk.

26:24.139 --> 26:26.331
You told Kurt?
I don't remember. Maybe.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.541
About Finn and Santana?

26:27.734 --> 26:28.618
No. I think I told him.

26:28.619 --> 26:29.787
Who told you?

26:29.788 --> 26:32.117
Me. I think Brittany told me.

26:32.118 --> 26:33.905
Or maybe it was puck.
Yeah, it was me.

26:33.906 --> 26:35.515
Everybody knew about this but me?

26:35.516 --> 26:37.247
Pretty much.
Nobody tells you anything

26:37.248 --> 26:39.250
because a, you're a blabber mouth

26:39.251 --> 26:41.026
and b, we all just
pretend to like you.

26:41.027 --> 26:42.580
That's not true.
I kind of like her.

26:42.581 --> 26:45.291
Look, Rachel, when this all happened,
you were dating

26:45.292 --> 26:47.465
another guy, so you don't
really have a right to be pissed

26:47.466 --> 26:48.760
at me about it, okay?

26:48.761 --> 26:50.634
And fine. I shouldn't
have lied about it,

26:50.635 --> 26:52.889
but to be honest,
that isn't what you care about.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.724
You care about the
Santana of it all.

26:54.725 --> 26:56.520
Oh, who are you right now?

26:56.521 --> 26:58.556
Best... green room...
ever. You know what?

26:58.557 --> 27:00.031
You guys are going to
have to find somebody else

27:00.032 --> 27:01.240
to mindlessly harmonize

27:01.241 --> 27:02.555
in the background, because I'm not

27:02.556 --> 27:04.060
going onstage with him.

27:04.061 --> 27:06.525
Make that two subs. I'm not
going out there with Brittany.

27:06.526 --> 27:07.981
Me, either. Enough!

27:08.742 --> 27:09.963
Listen to yourselves!

27:10.532 --> 27:11.844
I'm ashamed of you.

27:12.390 --> 27:14.162
Think back to where you
were this time last year.

27:14.469 --> 27:16.773
In this room. No set list,
no choreography.

27:16.774 --> 27:19.720
No chance in hell of winning,
but you did win.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.777
Because you did it together.

27:21.778 --> 27:23.702
Look, I don't care if you
guys hate each other.

27:23.918 --> 27:25.653
All I want is for you
guys to go out there

27:26.010 --> 27:28.325
and sing together. Get up there,

27:28.326 --> 27:29.302
and for six minutes,

27:29.303 --> 27:32.848
remind yourselves
that you're not alone.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.324
All right. Show time!

27:48.388 --> 27:50.260
Just tell me why you
would cheat on me.

27:50.261 --> 27:52.249
I don't know.
Why would I cheat on you?

27:52.250 --> 27:53.627
Is this, like, a mad lib,
or something?

27:53.628 --> 27:54.680
You cheated on me with Mike.

27:54.681 --> 27:57.192
You admitted it to me
in the green room. When?

27:57.193 --> 27:58.729
When I was accusing
you of adultery.

27:58.797 --> 28:00.197
What does that have to
do with me cheating?

28:00.265 --> 28:01.999
"Adultery" means cheating.

28:02.489 --> 28:03.734
I thought it meant being stupid.

28:04.939 --> 28:06.003
Like being a dolt.

28:06.870 --> 28:08.333
I didn't cheat on you.

28:08.573 --> 28:10.168
I did something much worse.

28:13.114 --> 28:15.006
I lost your magic comb.

28:15.147 --> 28:16.611
I don't know what happened.

28:16.612 --> 28:17.783
I had it in my pocket.

28:17.784 --> 28:20.494
And then I went to
motocross practice,

28:20.495 --> 28:22.485
and then, when I left,
it was gone.

28:22.486 --> 28:25.470
That's why I've been avoiding you.
I was so ashamed.

28:25.627 --> 28:26.392
That magic comb

28:26.393 --> 28:28.706
was our only chance of winning,
the only thing keeping me

28:28.707 --> 28:30.046
from totally screwing it up.

28:31.229 --> 28:32.993
I didn't want to let
you down, Artie.

28:33.394 --> 28:34.618
That wasn't a magic comb.

28:34.619 --> 28:36.603
I just found it on the floor

28:36.604 --> 28:38.684
and ran into you on the way
to tossing it in the trash.

28:38.737 --> 28:40.510
And you let me comb
my hair with it?

28:40.511 --> 28:42.251
You don't need a magic comb.

28:43.216 --> 28:45.568
You're magic, Brittany...
the way you move...

28:45.569 --> 28:47.011
And I just should
have told you that

28:47.012 --> 28:48.958
in the first place, and I'm sorry.

28:57.878 --> 28:59.635
When I'm out there dancing today,

28:59.636 --> 29:02.334
it won't be for the
team or for the crowd.

29:02.748 --> 29:03.974
It will be for you.

29:07.573 --> 29:08.744
What are you doing?

29:08.745 --> 29:09.880
I'm a wrestler.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.726
This is how I get psyched
up for competition.

29:12.556 --> 29:14.068
Listen, you don't
have to be nervous.

29:14.069 --> 29:16.130
You saved my life.
I've got your back.

29:16.941 --> 29:19.274
Oh, I'm not nervous. You know why?

29:19.275 --> 29:20.116
Why?

29:20.117 --> 29:22.014
Because show choir is stupid.

29:22.015 --> 29:24.967
And now for our final
performance of the program...

29:24.968 --> 29:27.874
From McKinley high,
the new directions!

29:27.875 --> 29:28.381
What?

29:31.323 --> 29:32.425
You look beautiful.

29:46.447 --> 29:53.233
* Now I've had the time of my life
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

29:53.234 --> 29:57.090
* No, I've never felt
like this before *

29:57.577 --> 30:02.111
* Yes, I swear it's the truth *

30:02.112 --> 30:04.365
* And I owe it all to you *

30:04.366 --> 30:10.998
* 'Cause I've had the
time of my life *

30:10.999 --> 30:14.226
* And I owe it all to you *

30:17.761 --> 30:19.948
* I've been waiting for so long *

30:19.949 --> 30:22.038
* And now I finally found someone *

30:22.039 --> 30:23.642
* To stand by me *

30:23.643 --> 30:26.214
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

30:26.215 --> 30:28.683
* We saw the writing on the wall *

30:28.684 --> 30:32.882
* As we felt this magical fantasy *

30:35.183 --> 30:37.208
* Now with passion in our eyes *

30:37.209 --> 30:40.971
* There's no way we could
disguise it secretly *

30:40.972 --> 30:43.678
* Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da... *

30:43.679 --> 30:45.839
* So we take each other's hand *

30:45.840 --> 30:50.265
* 'Cause we seem to
understand the urgency *

30:50.780 --> 30:51.764
* Oh *

30:51.765 --> 30:53.062
* Just remember *

30:53.947 --> 30:56.855
* You're the one thing *

30:57.362 --> 31:00.710
* I can't get enough of *

31:00.711 --> 31:02.061
* I can't get enough of *

31:02.062 --> 31:05.836
* So I'll tell you something *

31:07.027 --> 31:09.149
* This could be love *

31:09.150 --> 31:11.131
* Because *

31:11.132 --> 31:15.478
* I've had the time of my life *

31:15.989 --> 31:19.845
* No, I never felt this way before *

31:19.846 --> 31:22.192
* Never felt this way
Yes, I swear *

31:22.520 --> 31:24.210
* It's the truth *

31:24.619 --> 31:27.502
* And I owe it all to you *

31:27.503 --> 31:29.239
* Ba ba ba ba ba ba *

31:29.240 --> 31:30.711
* Ba ba ba ba ba ba *

31:30.712 --> 31:32.908
* Ba ba ba ba
Now, I *

31:32.909 --> 31:34.228
* Ooh...I *

31:34.229 --> 31:37.572
* Had the time of my life *

31:37.997 --> 31:40.889
* No, I never felt this way before *

31:40.890 --> 31:43.891
* Never felt this way
Yes, I swear *

31:44.125 --> 31:45.612
* It's the truth *

31:46.306 --> 31:48.555
* And I owe it all to you *

31:49.110 --> 31:53.938
* Oh, I had the time of my life *

31:53.939 --> 31:57.057
* Of my life
And I never felt *

31:57.058 --> 31:59.409
* This way before
Never felt this way *

31:59.410 --> 32:01.506
* Yes, I swear
Yes, I swear *

32:01.507 --> 32:03.645
* It's the truth
It's the truth *

32:03.646 --> 32:06.307
* And I owe it all to you *

32:06.308 --> 32:09.263
* Ooh... oh... oh... *

32:09.264 --> 32:12.303
* Oh... oh! *

32:28.755 --> 32:32.509
* Well, sometimes I
go out by myself *

32:32.510 --> 32:35.334
* And I look across the water
Ooh ooh ooh *

32:35.791 --> 32:38.042
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

32:38.043 --> 32:41.083
* And I think of all the things,
what you're doing *

32:41.084 --> 32:43.273
* And in my head,
I paint a picture *

32:43.274 --> 32:46.313
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

32:47.291 --> 32:49.030
* 'Cause since I've come on home *

32:49.031 --> 32:51.327
* Well, my body's been a mess *

32:51.328 --> 32:53.592
* And I miss your ginger hair *

32:53.593 --> 32:56.039
* And the way you like to dress *

32:56.606 --> 32:58.567
* Oh, won't you come on over? *

32:58.792 --> 33:01.741
* Stop making a fool out of me *

33:02.987 --> 33:06.800
* Why don't you come on over,
Valerie? *

33:07.697 --> 33:09.279
* Ba, ba, bada, ba,
ba, ba, bada ba *

33:09.280 --> 33:11.951
* Valerie...
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

33:11.952 --> 33:13.754
* Why don't you come on over? *

33:13.755 --> 33:16.921
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

33:16.922 --> 33:18.230
* Valerie, Valerie *

33:18.231 --> 33:21.115
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

33:21.116 --> 33:22.810
* Why don't you come on over? *

33:22.811 --> 33:24.034
* Well, sometimes *

33:24.035 --> 33:28.399
* I go out by myself and
I look across the water *

33:28.723 --> 33:30.378
* Ooh, ooh *

33:31.713 --> 33:34.958
* And I think of all the things,
what you're doing *

33:34.959 --> 33:38.211
* And in my head I paint a picture
Ooh, ooh *

33:41.032 --> 33:42.810
* 'Cause since I've come on home
Ah, ah... *

33:42.811 --> 33:45.189
* Well, my body's been a mess *

33:45.190 --> 33:47.313
* And I've missed your ginger hair *

33:47.314 --> 33:50.052
* And the way you like to dress *

33:50.267 --> 33:52.472
* Ah, ah... 
Won't you come on over? *

33:52.473 --> 33:55.444
* Stop makin' a fool out of me *

33:56.703 --> 34:01.018
* Oh, why don't you
come on over, Valerie? *

34:01.257 --> 34:03.163
* Ba, ba, bada, ba,
ba, ba, bada, ba *

34:03.164 --> 34:05.846
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

34:05.847 --> 34:07.625
* Why don't you come on over? *

34:07.626 --> 34:10.322
* Valerie, Valerie *

34:10.322 --> 34:11.726
* Why don't you come on over? *

34:11.728 --> 34:14.568
* Valerie
Ba, ba, bada, ba *

34:14.569 --> 34:19.320
* Why don't you come
on over Valerie? *

34:32.313 --> 34:34.812
And now, this year's head judge,
associate director

34:34.813 --> 34:36.571
of the Ohio department
of motor vehicles,

34:36.572 --> 34:39.360
Mr. Pete Sosnowski.

34:40.225 --> 34:41.217
Thank you.

34:41.928 --> 34:44.681
And thank you to all the groups
who performed here today.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.704
We all had a serious good time.

34:47.705 --> 34:50.726
You know what else is
a serious good time?

34:50.728 --> 34:53.149
Taking two minutes to save a life

34:53.150 --> 34:56.003
by filling out an
organ donor card.

34:56.004 --> 34:59.124
Because it's never
too late to donate.

35:00.896 --> 35:02.849
Drum roll, please.

35:03.898 --> 35:05.796
In third place...

35:06.851 --> 35:08.641
The hipsters!

35:12.880 --> 35:13.801
Thank you.

35:13.843 --> 35:15.370
Drive carefully.

35:15.371 --> 35:18.889
And now, the winner of this year's

35:18.890 --> 35:23.457
west-central sectional is...

35:28.058 --> 35:29.469
It's a tie.

35:30.049 --> 35:33.583
Congratulations! You're all
going to the regionals!

35:38.744 --> 35:40.955
Congratulations. Oh, nice work.
See you at regionals.

35:46.276 --> 35:47.542
We get to go on.

35:48.794 --> 35:49.664
Yeah.

35:53.909 --> 35:54.655
Hey.

35:54.895 --> 35:55.685
Hi.

35:57.908 --> 35:58.982
You okay?

35:59.140 --> 36:00.032
Is that it? Is that your trophy?

36:00.033 --> 36:01.509
Yeah, this is it. Wow.

36:01.751 --> 36:03.212
We won. I know. I heard.

36:03.213 --> 36:04.805
It's exciting.
Congratulations. Thanks.

36:04.806 --> 36:06.766
I wanted to call you, but I, uh...

36:07.436 --> 36:08.290
Emma, it's cool.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.323
Guess you didn't need your
good luck charm, after all.

36:10.324 --> 36:11.273
You were missed.

36:12.636 --> 36:14.439
I need to tell you
about my weekend.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.218
I think I'd rather not
hear all the details.

36:16.219 --> 36:18.605
Carl took me to Vegas...
why are you telling me this?

36:20.552 --> 36:23.184
Is-is that an engagement ring?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.169
It's a wedding ring, actually.

36:30.819 --> 36:31.901
I...

36:35.217 --> 36:36.878
I... I'm happy for you.

36:37.271 --> 36:38.631
Will, I... let's just...

36:38.632 --> 36:40.121
Leave it at that, hmm?

36:45.546 --> 36:48.047
When we first started Glee club,
I told Mr. Schuester

36:48.048 --> 36:50.754
that being a part of something
special makes you special,

36:50.755 --> 36:51.848
and I don't know, I just...

36:51.849 --> 36:53.949
I think I lost that
somewhere along the way.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.368
But winning that way
at sectionals...

36:56.369 --> 36:57.856
It really reminded me of it.

36:59.275 --> 37:00.776
Are we a part of
something special...

37:01.962 --> 37:02.727
You and me?

37:06.912 --> 37:07.814
Yes.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.372
I love you.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.248
No more lying...

37:22.137 --> 37:22.944
Ever.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.589
There's, um, something
that I-I need to tell you.

37:36.005 --> 37:38.397
Last week, when...
when we were fighting,

37:39.215 --> 37:39.981
I was...

37:39.982 --> 37:42.943
I was so mad at you and I was...
I was so hurt

37:42.944 --> 37:45.189
that I wanted to make you feel

37:45.190 --> 37:46.634
as bad as I felt.

37:51.345 --> 37:53.828
Is something wrong?
Did I bite you again?

37:53.829 --> 37:55.461
I did this to Finn once before.

37:55.462 --> 37:56.903
I-I can't do it again.

37:57.490 --> 37:58.832
I'm sorry. I have to go.

37:59.669 --> 38:00.485
I'm so sorry,

38:00.486 --> 38:02.217
and-and it will never,

38:02.218 --> 38:03.490
ever happen again.

38:03.491 --> 38:05.521
I knew you were a lot
of things, Rachel,

38:05.522 --> 38:08.206
and I loved you because and in
spite of all of them, but...

38:08.865 --> 38:10.237
I never thought you were mean.

38:10.238 --> 38:11.490
I'm saying that I'm sorry.

38:11.491 --> 38:13.301
And doesn't what you
did with Santana

38:13.302 --> 38:14.554
kind of cancel this out?

38:14.555 --> 38:15.719
We weren't together.

38:16.196 --> 38:18.339
I didn't cheat on you.
How could you do this to me?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.396
It was a mistake.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.161
Well, maybe we should go to
another counseling session

38:22.162 --> 38:22.645
with miss Pillsbury.

38:22.646 --> 38:25.209
Can't have couple's counseling
if you're not a couple.

38:25.831 --> 38:27.092
You're breaking up with me?

38:27.093 --> 38:29.416
What you did was
really bad, Rachel.

38:29.818 --> 38:31.824
And you knew how sensitive
I'd be about this

38:31.825 --> 38:33.284
after what happened with Quinn.

38:34.548 --> 38:36.610
You said you'd never
break up with me.

38:41.837 --> 38:43.920
I never thought you'd
make me feel like this.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.172
I got your text. What's wrong?

38:52.173 --> 38:53.992
It's Pavarotti. I think he's sick.

38:54.274 --> 38:56.532
I've been taking good care of him,
but he-he won't sing,

38:56.533 --> 38:58.453
and-and he's losing his feathers.

38:59.447 --> 39:01.161
Oh, he's just molting.

39:01.162 --> 39:02.438
He's growing a new
coat of feathers,

39:02.439 --> 39:04.367
so his body has to
shut down a little.

39:05.065 --> 39:06.490
But don't worry about it.

39:06.491 --> 39:11.465
He's got food, water,
he seems to like his cage.

39:11.466 --> 39:12.972
Just give it a little while.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.376
He'll be singing again in no time.

39:18.860 --> 39:19.750
Don't forget.

39:19.751 --> 39:21.778
Warbler practice tonight at 5:00.

39:21.779 --> 39:23.114
Regionals, here we come.

39:30.666 --> 39:31.712
You changed your look.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.124
Yeah, this is more me.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.002
I'm sorry I doubted you, Mike.

39:37.338 --> 39:38.268
Asian kiss?

39:38.861 --> 39:40.096
Asian kiss.

39:43.058 --> 39:44.693
Congratulations, guys.

39:44.894 --> 39:47.559
It wasn't pretty, but we're
moving on. You got that?

39:48.441 --> 39:50.524
And I, for one,
am going to be happy to have

39:50.525 --> 39:52.416
regionals and
nationals to focus on.

39:53.046 --> 39:55.349
Mr. Shue, we heard the news
about miss Pillsbury marrying

39:55.350 --> 39:58.199
the finest dentist alive.
It's all right.

39:59.094 --> 40:00.127
We don't need to talk about it.

40:00.128 --> 40:01.025
Now...

40:01.938 --> 40:03.859
I know we've had our, um...

40:04.647 --> 40:05.751
Our dramas this week,

40:06.495 --> 40:08.293
but our family's back
in a happy place,

40:08.918 --> 40:11.968
and I think we should celebrate
the best way we know how.

40:13.296 --> 40:15.434
Rachel... so how would
you like to solo?

40:16.767 --> 40:19.888
Thanks, but, um, I don't really
feel like a solo right now.

40:20.431 --> 40:21.937
I-I'd like to defer

40:21.938 --> 40:24.369
to this week's two unsung heroes,

40:25.437 --> 40:26.814
Mercedes and Tina.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.032
Well, don't have to ask me twice.

40:31.834 --> 40:37.073
* Happiness hit her like a train *

40:37.074 --> 40:38.832
* On a track *

40:44.702 --> 40:47.094
* Coming towards her *

40:48.175 --> 40:51.509
* Stuck, still no turning back *

40:56.521 --> 41:02.271
* She hid around corners,
and she hid under beds *

41:02.603 --> 41:04.034
* She killed it *

41:04.035 --> 41:08.714
* With kisses,
and from it she fled *

41:09.472 --> 41:12.279
* The dog days are over *

41:12.280 --> 41:15.532
* The dog days are done *

41:15.742 --> 41:21.450
* The horses are coming,
so you better run *

41:21.911 --> 41:25.473
* Run fast for your mother,
run fast for your father *

41:25.474 --> 41:26.701
* Run for your children *

41:26.702 --> 41:28.666
* For your sisters
and your brothers *

41:28.667 --> 41:31.479
* Leave all your love
and your loving behind *

41:31.480 --> 41:34.842
* You can't carry it with
you if you want to survive *

41:34.843 --> 41:37.843
* The dog days are over *

41:38.142 --> 41:41.151
* The dog days are done *

41:41.514 --> 41:43.718
* Can't you hear the horses ?*
