\h\hwith their new movie

12:46.560 --> 12:47.760
{\an1}premiering today.

12:47.830 --> 12:50.030
{\an1}I GOT MY TICKET.

{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI'm here live in Korea
to give you a first-hand look

{\an1}at how American cartoons
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hare made.

12:55.770 --> 12:59.740
{\an1}But first, let's take a look
\h\h\h\hback at the year 1928,

12:59.810 --> 13:01.780
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthe year when you
might have seen Al Capone

{\an1}dancing the Charleston
\hon top of a flagpole.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.220
{\an1}\h\h\h\hIt was also the year of
the very first Scratchy cartoon

{\an1}entitled "That Happy Cat."

13:22.300 --> 13:24.200
{\an1}( <i>whistling )</i>

13:29.540 --> 13:31.070
{\an1}The film did very poorly

13:31.140 --> 13:33.370
{\an1}but the following year,
Scratchy was teamed up

13:33.440 --> 13:35.680
{\an1}with a psychotic young mouse
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hnamed Itchy

13:35.740 --> 13:38.650
{\an1}and cartoon history was made.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.210
{\an1}Here's their first cartoon
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\htogether:
