Yeah.

19:31.247 --> 19:33.246
[ Voice breaking ] It's clear
that things are serious

19:33.247 --> 19:34.247
with you and Blue, so...

19:37.247 --> 19:40.246
...um, I think it's time
we get a divorce.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.246
Yeah, sure, no, I'm...

19:42.247 --> 19:43.247
It makes sense.

19:47.247 --> 19:49.246
It's gonna be weird
not being married to you.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.246
Yeah, I would've
thought it got weird

19:51.247 --> 19:53.246
when you started living
with another woman, but...

19:53.247 --> 19:53.417
[ Chuckles ]

19:56.127 --> 19:57.246
Yeah.

19:57.247 --> 19:58.247
Yeah.

19:58.248 --> 19:59.417
[ Sniffles ]

20:01.587 --> 20:05.246
I-It'll be weird not being
married to you, too.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.247
[ Cellphone chimes ]

20:07.247 --> 20:09.246
What's up?

20:09.247 --> 20:10.247
Oh, um, nothing.

20:12.247 --> 20:14.246
I don't know, actually, um...

20:14.247 --> 20:16.246
I don't know why
I'm hiding this.

20:16.247 --> 20:17.756
Uh...

20:17.757 --> 20:20.246
I-I met a guy at the bar
the other night,

20:20.247 --> 20:23.756
and, uh, he wants
to go out on Friday.

20:23.757 --> 20:24.247
With me.

20:26.247 --> 20:27.247
Cool.

20:29.247 --> 20:31.246
So you like him?

20:31.247 --> 20:34.256
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
we only went out once.

20:34.257 --> 20:36.257
But, you know, I think
he could be my soulmate.

They're old enough
to behave like adults,

20:52.587 --> 20:54.246
but they don't <i> think
</i> like adults.

20:54.247 --> 20:55.247
You just got to hang in there.

[ Sighs ]

20:56.757 --> 20:58.246
I don't know how
<i>you</i> handled it,

20:58.247 --> 21:01.246
with me sneaking in
and out of Darlene's
bedroom all the time.

21:01.247 --> 21:03.246
You guys were right downstairs
when we were going at it.

21:03.247 --> 21:04.757
We weren't exactly quiet.

21:13.127 --> 21:14.246
You know, David...
[Sighs]

21:14.247 --> 21:16.246
if you disappeared,

21:16.247 --> 21:18.247
everybody would think
you just ran off again.

21:20.247 --> 21:22.247
I pushed too hard.
I felt it.
