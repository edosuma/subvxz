Previously on "Quantico"...
Miranda: Natalie Vasquez?

00:03.750 --> 00:04.739
You know why
she would request

00:04.750 --> 00:05.785
an emergency
leave of absence?

00:05.790 --> 00:06.996
I got an e-mail from her
this morning.

00:07.000 --> 00:07.785
Did something happen?

00:07.790 --> 00:09.542
Natalie: Alex, run!

00:09.550 --> 00:12.337
When I was 17,
I was part of an organization.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.581
Like a cult?
My dad rescued me.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.423
My son's a greater danger
to himself than you know.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.227
But I do.
I was there.

00:19.230 --> 00:20.299
You thought
if you blew yourself up

00:20.310 --> 00:21.846
in the middle
of the courthouse,

00:21.850 --> 00:24.557
you would show people
the truth?
I was just a kid!

00:24.560 --> 00:27.051
I'm on a rescue mission.
Who are you
trying to rescue?

00:27.060 --> 00:28.550
My best friend.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.482
Ross tried to leave, too,
but they wouldn't let him.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.196
You ready?
Tonight's the big night.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.906
Will: Besides the fact
that I'll be penetrating

00:33.910 --> 00:35.946

I'd call tonight pretty average.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.736

Drew: _
We have a connection,

00:39.960 --> 00:40.995
but I don't think
we should explore it

00:41.000 --> 00:42.410
any more
than we already have.

00:42.420 --> 00:44.411
Your project
might have some life in it.

You're not_in the clear because
I'm coming after you now.

Alex: I want to speak to Caleb.
I know you're hiding him.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.831
You need help.
I think you're the only one
that needs help.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.216
She fell for it.

You're fine.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.361
Why -- Why'd you handcuff me
to the radiator?

01:25.370 --> 01:27.691
You asked me to.

through all this, Alex.

01:36.670 --> 01:38.831

My mom and I
had to dry out my dad

01:41.220 --> 01:43.381
more times
than I can count.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.268
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

Where the hell is she?

01:48.270 --> 01:50.147
[ Sighs ] Gone.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.061
Off the grid.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.435
Her, Will, Simon.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.489
And you really think
that she could be behind this?

01:56.490 --> 01:58.856
I mean [Sniffs]
we know her.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.863
Nobody knows anybody.

02:01.870 --> 02:02.905

02:03.950 --> 02:06.578
So, how do we find her?

02:06.580 --> 02:09.879
Or Simon or Will or [Sniffs]
whoever's behind that voice?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.087
The only thing we had
was a bunch of level-A suits

02:12.090 --> 02:14.547
stolen in the Columbia break-in,
and that led nowhere.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.166
Look, I -- I got to go to work,
and then I'll be back.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.546
Alex, wait.

02:18.550 --> 02:21.678
We're heading down
a-a major conspiracy right now,

02:21.680 --> 02:24.638
and you're gonna head
to the FBI basement
to push papers?

02:24.640 --> 02:26.176
They're gonna think
something's up if I don't.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.169

Neither do the newbies.

an inch of his life by Caleb.

Well, that's not what Will said.
Why would he lie?

that put him in the hospital?

are you gonna give?

and we'll figure
something else out?

Um -- Um, I'm sorry.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.656
I just had to say hi
to an old friend.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.991
I didn't know
you were back in town.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.036
No, I didn't tell you.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.371
We're upgrading
our security system,

09:10.380 --> 09:12.462
and Miss Wyatt noticed
that our old O.S.

09:12.470 --> 09:14.711
wasn't doing us any favors.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.042
So she volunteered to personally
supervise our transition

09:18.050 --> 09:19.881
to McGregor-Wyatt's
sobeare and hardware.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.597
Mm.
That's so kind of you.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.977
Your old stomping grounds,
huh?

09:24.980 --> 09:27.016
Must be fun to be back.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.853
So, met any of our classmates
while you've been here?

09:29.860 --> 09:32.317
No, I'm just here
on business.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.060
Why don't you stop by
when you have a second?

09:34.070 --> 09:36.482
Uh,
it's been way too long.

09:36.490 --> 09:39.823
Oh, and here I was thinking
it hadn't been long enough.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.900
[ Sighs ] Okay.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.868
[ Clears throat ]
So, page eight.

09:44.870 --> 09:46.610
Did you reach Vasquez?

09:46.620 --> 09:49.077
I went by her place
and looked around.
Hmm.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.082
Yes, I still have a key.
That's not the point.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.125
Everything's still there.

09:52.130 --> 09:54.507
Her clothes, her laptop,
her passport.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.750
What does that tell you?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.376
You haven't told me anything
that can't be explained

09:58.380 --> 09:59.768
by a last-minute getaway.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.715
No, no, no. I had the guys
check her credit cards,

10:01.720 --> 10:02.709
ping her cell.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.971
Zero activity.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.049
The last cellphone ping

10:05.060 --> 10:06.596
was six days ago
near Ward's Island.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.669
10:13 pm.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.977
That's 30 minutes

10:08.980 --> 10:09.810
before Alex showed up
to my apartment crying.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.640
That's crazy.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.481
That doesn't mean
It's a connCIdence.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.276
Fine.
I'll take it to Miranda.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.929
Wait!

10:16.940 --> 10:18.771
Not until we figure out
what happened

10:18.780 --> 10:21.032
and find proof.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.076
So, what's next
for the day?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.286
Are we going
to further develop

10:24.290 --> 10:25.826
our undercover identities
or not?

10:25.830 --> 10:28.446
Maybe learn how to collect
intelligence?

10:28.450 --> 10:31.294
Give me 5,000 words
on each of these cases.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.915
Cartel killings?

10:32.920 --> 10:36.299
What does this have to do with
Infiltratlng an extremist cell?

10:36.300 --> 10:39.679
You know, it's a myth
that Arab women are submissive.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.806
It really is.

10:40.810 --> 10:42.675
Um, Agent Freed,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.636
we just need
a little more context.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.176
Okay.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.057
How about
chain of command?

10:48.060 --> 10:50.062
There's your context.

10:50.070 --> 10:54.222
When you're finished,
swing by my place.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.357
That's it.
I'm texting Liam now.

10:57.610 --> 10:58.645
Drew: Career day?

10:58.650 --> 11:00.402
Could this feel more like
high school?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.650
Who's your first stop?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.321
It's the rep
from White Collar.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.900
You want to bust
billionaires?

11:04.910 --> 11:05.899
Are you kidding me?

11:05.910 --> 11:07.775
An assignment

11:07.780 --> 11:10.044
where I get to meet my future
husband and arrest him?

11:10.050 --> 11:12.166
[ Chuckles ]
Sign me up.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.991
The cartels own half the border
between Del Rio and Laredo,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.627
and they do not play nice.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.370
Then again,
neither do I.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.057
I'm gonna go wander.

Alex, right?
Yes. Hi.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.068
We've actually met,
but you were just a kid.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.061
I, uh -- I went through here
with your father.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.935
Oh.

11:35.940 --> 11:38.727
He was one of the most exciting
and inspiring men I've known.

11:38.730 --> 11:41.278
Thank you.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.157
I know the Office
of Professional Responsibility

11:43.160 --> 11:44.400
isn't sexy,

11:44.410 --> 11:46.947
but is there anything
I can answer for you?

11:46.950 --> 11:48.986
Um...

11:48.990 --> 11:50.321
actually, yes.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.036
There is.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.281
Well, C.T. sounds amazing.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.667
But what do you guys
do for fun?

11:56.670 --> 11:58.376
For fun, we work.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.257
Yeah, but when
you're not working.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.966
At C.T.,
we call that sleeping.

12:03.840 --> 12:08.129
Look, if it's a friend
you're worried about medically,

12:08.140 --> 12:10.017
OPR's guidelines
are very clear.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.556
You have to say something.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.936
Turn in a friend?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.261
There's no other way
this ends well.

frontier in law enforcement.

We know it's not glamorous.

You'll spend more hours a day
in a small, dark room

extensively online.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.427

to catch them In anythIng.

And what goes on in there past
those introductory assessments,

12:49.680 --> 12:51.648

your top three choices.

placed in these programs,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.270
most of you will not.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.896
That's because today wasn't
about you checking them out.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.868
It was_ about them
checkIng you out.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.458
are the names of the programs

13:19.710 --> 13:22.042
that you've received interest
from one program.

her entire company with her.

has Miranda on her side,
she's untouchable.

Blackout protocol says

14:48.460 --> 14:51.304
the servers can only be down
for six seconds.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.461
If we're still down
at seven seconds,
that is a problem.

Got it?

of my business.

in here,

to our servers.

allegations made against you.

I would say something.

Do you?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.390
Okay.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.393
So, what would you like me
to tell everyone?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.970
That I made
a mistake again?

That [Sighs] all the events
that I referred to in your life

17:12.950 --> 17:14.850

nothing but trivia?

17:14.860 --> 17:17.317
You should start
payIng attentIon, Alex.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.073
You're still running around
playing the victim

17:20.080 --> 17:22.071
and hurting people
while you do it.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.492
You hurt Ryan
when he got shot.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.740
You hurt Nimah and Raina

17:25.750 --> 17:27.706

drove them apart.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.826

personal vendetta.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.829
Face it, Alex.

is over,

And not believing me today,
that might be the worst.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.562
On my mark,

17:56.990 --> 18:00.198
land at the balcony, breach,
and eliminate the threat inside.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.158

a training exercise,

18:03.160 --> 18:05.116

NATs today, and they're so --

39:27.570 --> 39:29.606
[ Chuckles ]

39:29.610 --> 39:31.612
They're so bright
and shiny.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.157
They have no idea
what they're in for.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.651
This --
This isn't easy work.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.828
We go undercover
with criminals.

39:40.830 --> 39:45.756
We -- We face the dark side
of humanity every single day.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.832
But we do it 'cause we're making
the world a better place.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.489
And I truly believe that.

39:50.500 --> 39:55.631
And whether or not you take
that home with you is --

39:55.640 --> 39:57.267
It's up to you.

39:57.270 --> 40:01.604
Do you...
take it home with you?

40:01.610 --> 40:04.397
Every day.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.107
But it hasn't broken me
yet.

40:07.110 --> 40:08.930
Liam:
As many of you know,

40:08.940 --> 40:12.649
Drew Perales left this evening
of his own volition.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.902
He declined
something we asked of him --

40:15.910 --> 40:22.031
to face a potential future
that wasn't pretty head-on.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.371
If you want to make it here,

40:23.380 --> 40:25.450
if you want to make it
out there,

40:25.460 --> 40:27.121
you're going
to have to accept the fact

40:27.130 --> 40:28.700
that we all have strengths...

40:28.710 --> 40:30.246
[ Knock on door ]

40:30.250 --> 40:32.423
...and weaknesses.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.427
Agent Susan Coombs,
your new handler.

40:36.430 --> 40:38.500
Agent Coombs,
so nice to meet you.

40:38.510 --> 40:39.920
My sister and I were
just making a list

40:39.930 --> 40:42.228
of all the programs
we're interested in.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.936
White collar,
cyber crime --

40:43.940 --> 40:46.181
Securities fraud
should be the last thing
on both of your minds.

40:46.190 --> 40:47.680
Do you have any idea
what kind of an asset

40:47.690 --> 40:49.760
you're going to be
in counterterrorism?

40:49.770 --> 40:51.988
Liam: You're gonna have to come
to terms with who you are,

40:51.990 --> 40:54.447
not who you want to be.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.488
Because we're not training you
to be heroes.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.038
We're training you to be FBI.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.166
Caleb's gone?

41:03.170 --> 41:05.456
He's gone.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.530
So, I only have one question.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.701
Are you ready?

41:16.890 --> 41:19.677
Shelby: A church.
Why a church?

41:19.680 --> 41:22.092
Could the trace be wrong?

41:22.100 --> 41:24.728
Will: Who is it?
Who's there?

41:24.730 --> 41:26.186
Alex.

41:26.190 --> 41:27.805
[ Exhales sharply]
Will.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.471
No,dont,dont!
Don't come any closer.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.469
Stay back.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.697
No, stay back.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.941
Stay back.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.690
I was dropped here.
Where's Simon?

41:35.700 --> 41:37.907
I don't know.
Just stay back.

41:37.910 --> 41:39.730
I'm sick.
I don't have much time.

41:39.740 --> 41:41.150
Hey, what are
you talking about?

41:41.160 --> 41:42.878
I helped build it.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.246
I helped build it
with my own hands.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.569
Build what?

41:46.580 --> 41:47.740
The nuke.

41:47.750 --> 41:48.819
You have to find it.

41:48.830 --> 41:51.287
Please, you...

41:51.290 --> 41:53.713
you have to find it fast.
