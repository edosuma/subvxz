WEBVTT

00:57.097 --> 00:58.741
It's okay.

01:05.342 --> 01:06.480
Just pick it up!!

01:23.825 --> 01:26.180
A lot of lucky people
were on this beach.

01:26.215 --> 01:29.900
One fatality. The pilot.

01:29.935 --> 01:32.887
EPA had some environmental
concerns with the fuel spill.

01:32.922 --> 01:34.852
And now we're waiting on  NTSB.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.859
Yes, so we can't touch
a thing till they get here.

01:37.894 --> 01:39.712
And I can't touch the body.

01:39.747 --> 01:42.230
A lot of people are gonna
want to look at this one Alexx.

01:42.265 --> 01:44.973
Poor guy's gonna have to wait.

01:45.822 --> 01:50.064
This poor guy has covered
up his registration numbers.

01:50.099 --> 01:53.770
I guess he didn't want to be
recognized by Coast Guard or FAA.

01:53.805 --> 01:56.539
The question is,

01:57.674 --> 01:59.885
what was he hiding?

01:59.920 --> 02:02.433
You find something?

02:03.349 --> 02:06.085
That looks like a drain with the

02:06.120 --> 02:09.478
valve blown off.

02:15.531 --> 02:17.616
It could have been
sheared off on the beach.

02:17.651 --> 02:20.972
I think this one has
been helped along.

02:21.116 --> 02:22.584
You mean sabotage?

02:22.619 --> 02:24.182
Nope,

02:24.217 --> 02:25.884
I mean murder.

03:00.853 --> 03:03.454
CSI: MiaMi
2x21  Not Landing

03:03.580 --> 03:05.124
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS:  2004/05/03

03:47.500 --> 03:49.169
A lot of fish in the water on this one.

03:49.204 --> 03:50.872
NTSB just released him.

03:50.907 --> 03:52.346
I need a cause of death
as soon as you know, Alexx

03:53.381 --> 03:55.528
You'll be the first.

04:10.182 --> 04:13.022
It was set up to climb,
auto-pilot was on.

04:13.057 --> 04:15.062
Could have been pilot error.

04:15.097 --> 04:17.515
I guess that's possible.

04:17.350 --> 04:21.619
Took out the seats and replaced
them with these fuel bladders.

04:21.654 --> 04:25.915
Meaning that a cargo plane
designed for long distance travel.

04:25.950 --> 04:28.865
Long flight over the ocean.
Pilot probably had a class four rating.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.544
- He knew what he was doing.
- Travelling with no identification.

04:32.579 --> 04:33.993
You think he was smuggling?

04:34.028 --> 04:38.302
I don't know, but whatever it was, 250
gallons of it was flushed from that bladder,

04:38.337 --> 04:41.773
out of that valve
before he crashed.

04:48.348 --> 04:51.077
We need to take this whole plane
back to our hangar for a prelim,

04:51.112 --> 04:54.534
- cargo included.
- Well, not before we go over it.

04:54.569 --> 04:57.118
We might tell you
what brought it down.

05:54.113 --> 05:55.969
Speed!

05:56.004 --> 05:57.343
What have we got?

05:57.378 --> 06:01.546
Uh, Manganese Dioxide fused
with Potassium Hydroxide,

06:01.581 --> 06:04.886
creates Potassium Permanganate.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.710
It's primarily used to disinfect
cocaine. It makes it totally pure.

06:07.745 --> 06:11.445
Yes, the South American drug trade
is dying to get their hands on this stuff.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.441
The DEA has a restriction on it.

06:13.476 --> 06:16.253
Makes 250 Gallons
pretty valuable cargo.

06:16.288 --> 06:20.342
Yeah, so our guy was on
a delivery run when he crashed.

06:20.377 --> 06:21.818
Hang on a second. Yeah.

06:21.853 --> 06:24.992
Hey, I checked the plane's
registration with the FAA,

06:25.027 --> 06:27.162
the pilot's name is Adam Decker,

06:27.197 --> 06:28.758
Rockwater address.

06:28.793 --> 06:32.114
He co-owns the plane with his
business partner, Wess Gallagher.

06:32.149 --> 06:34.402
Okay, did you get the name
of their business?

06:34.437 --> 06:38.125
Yes, Dolsen Treatment Labs.
I'll keep you posted.

06:39.614 --> 06:41.189
Chemicals!

06:41.224 --> 06:45.291
Okay, Rockwater here we come.

07:09.641 --> 07:10.845
Mrs. Gallagher?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.170
Yes.

07:12.205 --> 07:13.719
Is your husband home?

07:13.754 --> 07:15.103
He's in the back.

07:15.138 --> 07:17.599
- Is there trouble?
- No, I'd just like to speak to him.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.854
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

07:28.871 --> 07:30.638
Fly away homes.

07:30.673 --> 07:32.915
Suburbia on the runway.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.664
Yeah, an affluent community.

07:34.699 --> 07:38.057
Fly to Orlando for a meeting,
home for dinner.

07:38.092 --> 07:40.164
Where do we go maam?

07:40.328 --> 07:44.522
I worked on that plane to keep it
in the air, not bury it on Miami Beach.

07:44.557 --> 07:48.394
- So he trusted you to maintain it?
- We were partners, I hope so.

07:48.429 --> 07:49.999
You and Adam went to Yale together.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.731
He pushed test tubes
around for a few years,

07:51.766 --> 07:53.471
they gave him a degree
in chemical engineering.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.754
And you got one
for mechanical engineering.

07:55.789 --> 08:00.055
That's right. / Together you created
"Dolsen Treatment Labs".

08:00.090 --> 08:02.855
Quite a success story I understand.

08:02.890 --> 08:06.121
You spilled something on your boot.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.957
It's probably just fuel.

08:08.992 --> 08:12.043
Actually,
it's Potassium Permanganate,

08:12.078 --> 08:14.221
which is what you and
Adam were smuggling right?

08:14.256 --> 08:16.210
No, that's not true.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.024
Speed, let's take a
look at his hands, alright?

08:19.059 --> 08:20.753
Why?

08:20.788 --> 08:23.212
To eliminate you

08:23.247 --> 08:25.131
as a suspect.

08:29.223 --> 08:30.745
What is this thing?

08:30.780 --> 08:34.340
Ah, it's just a little toy
we have for sniffing out residue.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.765
Like what?

08:35.799 --> 08:43.376
Like RDX, which is an explosive
that we found on the fuselage as well.

08:43.412 --> 08:44.862
So what did you do? You uh,

08:44.897 --> 08:47.940
sabotage the valves
with the explosives?

09:04.002 --> 09:07.321
And when the chemicals
blew out during the flight,

09:13.961 --> 09:17.018
it affected the center of gravity.

09:17.053 --> 09:20.026
The tail goes down,

09:20.061 --> 09:22.634
the nose goes up.

09:22.669 --> 09:25.263
It stalls,

09:25.298 --> 09:27.328
and then crashes.

09:27.363 --> 09:28.824
Right, Wess?

09:37.701 --> 09:39.510
I didn't intend to kill him.

09:39.545 --> 09:42.515
I just didn't want him to make
the run to South America.

09:42.550 --> 09:45.419
I told him that there had to be
other ways to raise the money.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.242
Raise the money?
For what?

09:49.351 --> 09:51.729
We were working on a
new plane together.

09:51.764 --> 09:54.207
State-of-the-art design.

09:54.349 --> 09:56.002
He was a good pilot.

09:56.037 --> 09:58.805
He should have been able
to make a soft landing.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.864
I didn't want him to
get arrested for smuggling.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.291
I was trying to protect him.

10:02.326 --> 10:05.387
I guess you didn't
try hard enough, did you?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.301
That was Alexx.

10:08.336 --> 10:11.990
Adam Decker died of Carbon
Monoxide poisoning.

10:12.025 --> 10:14.872
So Adam died before the crash.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.886
Wess' sabotage didn't kill him.

10:19.178 --> 10:21.697
You just got lucky Wess.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.446
This Adam Decker suffocated
on the plane's combustion.

10:31.481 --> 10:34.066
Yeah, Alexx said
respiratory arrest.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.486
Carbon Monoxide starved
his body of oxygen.

10:39.783 --> 10:42.527
CO poisoning usually
turns the skin red.

10:42.562 --> 10:44.117
Why not our guy?

10:44.152 --> 10:45.527
He was Anemic.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.735
Low hemoglobin,

10:47.770 --> 10:50.735
no redness.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.801
Got a scrape here.

10:55.836 --> 10:58.237
Yeah, you're gonna have a
few scrapes, it was a plane crash.

10:58.272 --> 11:00.418
Hmm, well thanks for the update,

11:00.453 --> 11:03.120
but uh, this is not from
hitting the beach.

11:03.155 --> 11:05.243
Well, NTSB brought it in a flatbed.

11:05.278 --> 11:07.342
It's not like they put it in bubble wrap.

11:07.377 --> 11:09.873
Yeah, realize that too.

11:09.908 --> 11:11.614
Someone keyed this.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.662
Ok, I see that.
But why would somebody do that?

11:18.697 --> 11:21.768
At these airparks, these planes
are like sports cars.

11:21.803 --> 11:24.202
People's pride and joy.

11:27.876 --> 11:31.216
You key one of these things,
you're sending a message.

11:31.484 --> 11:33.574
My husband flew that plane
yesterday afternoon.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.813
It was fine.

11:34.848 --> 11:35.984
Ok, well uhm,

11:36.019 --> 11:39.391
can you think of anyone who
had a grudge against your husband?

11:39.426 --> 11:42.195
He worked with all kinds
of people in his business.

11:42.230 --> 11:46.271
We were thinking someone
a little closer to home.

11:47.803 --> 11:50.584
He didn't care
for Jeff Latham very much.

11:50.619 --> 11:52.833
Who's he? / Neighbor.

11:52.868 --> 11:57.670
Jeff never shared the same enthusiasm
for flying that my husband did.

11:57.828 --> 12:00.395
Jeff lives in a airpark
and he doesn't like flying?

12:00.430 --> 12:02.708
His wife.

12:05.583 --> 12:09.103
My husband would run
engine tests late at night.

12:09.138 --> 12:12.812
Jeff would show his appreciation by rolling
our trash barrels into the street the next morning.

12:12.847 --> 12:14.829
Stupid stuff.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.280
Then it got serious.

12:16.315 --> 12:18.217
How serious?

12:18.252 --> 12:21.482
Jeff took a swing at Adam
over by the airstrip,

12:21.517 --> 12:23.297
for buzzing over his house.

12:23.332 --> 12:25.083
The more Adam laughed about it,

12:25.118 --> 12:27.285
the angrier Jeff got.

12:28.569 --> 12:31.819
Guess it's settled now, isn't it?

12:34.286 --> 12:36.872
Oh yeah, we had our differences.

12:36.907 --> 12:39.019
No question.

12:39.054 --> 12:40.754
Despite what he thinks,

12:40.789 --> 12:42.736
there are rules to  follow in airparks.

12:42.771 --> 12:45.490
Airparks and everywhere else.

12:45.525 --> 12:47.756
So what did my husband do now?

12:48.910 --> 12:51.272
Nothing, let me handle this.

12:51.307 --> 12:53.968
You know last week he did throw
some garden tools on the runway.

12:54.003 --> 12:55.410
Can you arrest him for that?

12:55.445 --> 12:59.104
Don't you have some
propellars to polish or something?

13:01.249 --> 13:02.843
Look, whatever it
was this time, trust me.

13:02.878 --> 13:04.960
Adam Decker had it coming.

13:04.995 --> 13:07.855
You mean like dying
in a plane crash?

13:08.332 --> 13:11.209
This morning on Miami Beach.

13:11.244 --> 13:12.940
You don't think
I had something to do with that?

13:12.975 --> 13:14.303
You two have a history.

13:14.338 --> 13:15.894
Yeah, but that
doesn't mean I went out...

13:15.929 --> 13:19.480
We have evidence that proves his
plane was vandalized prior to the crash.

13:19.515 --> 13:21.704
Scraped with a car key.

13:21.854 --> 13:23.802
Care to show us your set
for comparison?

13:23.837 --> 13:26.298
No, because I'll tell you right now!

13:26.333 --> 13:28.558
Okay, I did take a swipe at his plane,

13:28.593 --> 13:32.172
because the man was smug,
and he was pompous and reckless.

13:32.207 --> 13:34.193
I gotta say guys, I hated him.

13:34.228 --> 13:36.761
Enough to poison him
with carbon monoxide?

13:36.796 --> 13:39.139
This was just a
neighborhood dispute.

13:39.174 --> 13:40.731
It was nothing.

13:40.766 --> 13:43.289
Well, I tell ya Jeff,

13:43.421 --> 13:46.333
it's something now.

13:59.782 --> 14:03.263
So his boss said he just came
back from uh, parking a car.

14:03.298 --> 14:05.863
Ran back and just fell out.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.829
Going to soon, sugar.

14:09.864 --> 14:12.178
No visible trauma.

14:12.952 --> 14:16.546
But it wouldn't be the first time
paramedics missed an entry wound.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.304
You need some help? / Nah,

14:18.339 --> 14:21.207
I could undress
a dead man in my sleep.

14:21.242 --> 14:23.411
I'm leaving that one alone.

14:31.186 --> 14:32.415
Alexx!!!

14:32.450 --> 14:33.989
It's ok.

14:36.544 --> 14:38.478
You okay?

14:38.513 --> 14:41.298
- Yeah.
- You want me to call  rescue?

14:41.488 --> 14:43.518
I'm fine.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.352
Exploding jacket.

14:47.207 --> 14:49.895
got us another crime scene.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.103
Smells like lead.

14:52.138 --> 14:54.526
It's part of a key pad.
Could be home made.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.999
If somebody was trying to kill this boy,

14:56.034 --> 14:57.968
they were about half an hour too late.

14:58.003 --> 15:00.165
Not too late to almost take you out.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.980
You ok? Sure? / Yeah.

15:05.922 --> 15:08.664
We're not done with our prelim, guys.

15:08.776 --> 15:11.279
Oh, we're just looking.

15:11.429 --> 15:14.090
So how do you think the carbon
monoxide got into the cockpit?

15:14.125 --> 15:19.303
Well, the weakest part of any exhaust system
is where the pipe is weldedto the muffler.

15:20.451 --> 15:21.944
This one's cracked.

15:21.979 --> 15:23.804
That could have cracked on impact.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.872
Could have, but uh,

15:25.907 --> 15:28.580
that definitely didn't.

15:29.037 --> 15:31.951
Oh, look at here,
someone's drilled a hole into the pipe.

15:31.986 --> 15:35.413
Yeah, the carbon monoxide
would have filled the engine bay.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.852
The engine bay is completely
sealed off from the rest of the plane.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.955
Not anymore.

15:44.990 --> 15:49.483
Someone drilled a hole through
the firewall into the cockpit.

15:49.957 --> 15:52.818
Carbon monoxide,
you can't see it, can't smell it.

15:52.853 --> 15:54.897
Poor guy didn't
even have a chance.

16:11.243 --> 16:13.520
You said the auto-pilot
was engaged right?

16:13.555 --> 16:15.588
Plane flies itself till
it's told  otherwise.

16:15.623 --> 16:17.015
Why did it stop flying?

16:17.050 --> 16:19.481
Could have flown into a rain cloud,
wings could have iced up.

16:19.516 --> 16:22.873
Ice changes the shape of the
wing and disrupts the airflow.

16:22.908 --> 16:24.001
It's ironic.

16:24.036 --> 16:26.402
Who could've guessed
that ice could  kill you in Miami?

16:27.037 --> 16:29.877
A good pilot could have regained
control before it hit the beach.

16:29.912 --> 16:32.331
- Yeah, not a dead one.
- Just so you know,

16:32.366 --> 16:35.045
you can't take any
of this from the hangar.

16:35.138 --> 16:38.895
This accident may have been
caused by an intentional criminal act.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.780
It's the smallest little piece.

16:43.815 --> 16:45.990
Just the smallest.

16:51.514 --> 16:54.093
I need a copy of everything
for the public document.

16:54.128 --> 16:56.065
You'll get it.

16:56.584 --> 16:58.927
You know what?
I got one more question.

16:58.962 --> 17:01.568
Was there any radio
traffic before the crash?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.791
No May-day, just a phone call.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.595
Look tower.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.272
Do you know where it came from?

17:10.308 --> 17:14.066
Neighbor back at the airpark.
Guy named Tony Mackin.

17:14.101 --> 17:17.038
He was monitoring the airport
frequency, heard the pilot on the radio,

17:17.073 --> 17:19.246
got worried
and called the FAA.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.510
Well, it looks like we've got
another suspect.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.383
Thank you very much.

17:26.205 --> 17:30.189
Mr. Mackin, NTSB said you heard
Adam Decker's radio call before the ...

17:32.224 --> 17:34.303
Yeah, I made them respond.

17:34.338 --> 17:36.433
You monitor the airport frequency?

17:36.468 --> 17:40.704
Yeah, I got like uh,
inner ear imbalance.

17:40.739 --> 17:41.557
They say I can't fly anymore.

17:41.592 --> 17:43.650
So I'm like the resident
control tower right now.

17:43.685 --> 17:46.787
You remember what Decker said?

17:46.822 --> 17:50.628
Something about making
an unscheduled stop.

17:50.783 --> 17:53.989
Advise. will be diverting to Miami.

17:54.422 --> 18:00.932
Changing frequency to
Miami flight services station.

18:00.967 --> 18:04.796
You know, one words he said was
he couldn't keep his eyes open.

18:06.631 --> 18:09.182
Do you remember approximately
what time that was?

18:09.217 --> 18:12.552
Yeah, it was like 9:30.

18:12.587 --> 18:15.480
You know, I called FAA
right after I heard him.

18:15.515 --> 18:17.057
Ok. Great!

18:17.092 --> 18:18.734
Well, thank you for your time.

18:18.769 --> 18:22.528
Yeah.

18:25.762 --> 18:27.307
Something's not right about that.

18:27.342 --> 18:29.901
Yeah, we need a timeline.

18:40.251 --> 18:44.215
Hey. / The FAA logged
Mackin's call at 9:35.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.372
Ok. The plane hit the beach
15 minutes later.

18:47.407 --> 18:49.541
Is this chamber the same area
as the cockpit?

18:49.576 --> 18:53.928
Yeah, the dummy, and the seat,
the bladder's in the rear.

18:53.963 --> 18:57.051
So we can figure out how much
CO was pumped into the cabin.

18:57.086 --> 19:01.906
Yeah. I am using the manufacturer's
recommended setting to calculate the amount of CO.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.178
I added a color dye for reference.

19:10.719 --> 19:13.449
15 minutes after take-off,

19:13.484 --> 19:16.916
there was enough CO in the
cockpit to put the pilot into a coma.

19:16.951 --> 19:20.860
So at that rate of flow,
how much longer did he have?

19:26.809 --> 19:28.563
Five minutes max.

19:28.598 --> 19:31.020
Wendy said he took off at nine.

19:31.055 --> 19:33.006
So he would have
been dead by 9:20.

19:33.041 --> 19:38.318
Mackin said he heard Decker's voice
over the radio for sure after 9:30.

19:38.353 --> 19:41.551
Mackin is lying.
I'm gonna call Horatio.

19:43.681 --> 19:45.332
I screwed up the time, so what?

19:45.367 --> 19:49.107
Why did you wait 20 minutes
to call the FAA.

19:49.226 --> 19:50.301
I was busy.

19:50.336 --> 19:51.814
What's her name Tony?

19:51.849 --> 19:53.818
- What are you talking about?
- The woman you were with,

19:53.853 --> 19:56.058
what's her name?

19:59.001 --> 20:00.987
Wendy Decker.

20:01.022 --> 20:03.218
The victim's wife. Interesting.

20:03.253 --> 20:04.525
Yeah.

20:04.560 --> 20:09.122
So the husbands fly away,
and leave the wives behind for old Tony.

20:09.157 --> 20:12.293
Hey, they knock on my door,
I don't knock on their doors.

20:12.328 --> 20:14.914
You know what I'm sayin'?

20:14.997 --> 20:19.813
So Wendy visited, and you were monitoring
her husband Adam on the radio.

20:19.848 --> 20:22.420
We always left the radio on
in case Adam turned around.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.593
You know, we didn't
want any surprises.

20:24.628 --> 20:29.555
Except this time, you know, Wendy,
she asked me to turn the radio off.

20:29.590 --> 20:33.682
Wendy told you to turn the radio off
after she heard her husband's voice?

20:33.717 --> 20:35.677
Yeah.

20:36.182 --> 20:37.564
You know what?

20:37.599 --> 20:40.195
Let's go visit the grieving widow.

20:42.721 --> 20:47.216
You have quite the little
Cul-de-sac going here.

20:47.326 --> 20:52.167
So Wendy, you were in bed
with Tony when Adam called

20:52.202 --> 20:56.205
on the radio and you
instructed Tony to shut it off.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.679
- Right?
- I was embarassed.

20:58.714 --> 21:01.768
Not enough to stop
what you were doing.

21:04.678 --> 21:10.435
November 4879-487 pappa
as advised diverting to Miami.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.489
It's Adam, turn it off.

21:13.641 --> 21:15.619
Changing the frequency.

21:15.835 --> 21:18.482
Do you have any idea
how guilty I feel about this?

21:18.517 --> 21:21.111
Guilty that you and your
boyfriend killed your husband?

21:21.146 --> 21:22.747
Tony's not my boyfriend.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.463
Frankly, it was a way to get
back at Adam for cheating on me.

21:25.498 --> 21:28.059
Wendy, that's called motive.

21:28.094 --> 21:29.951
Only if I killed him.

21:29.986 --> 21:31.329
And I didn't.

21:31.364 --> 21:33.699
Who was your husband seeing?

21:33.793 --> 21:37.520
- I don't know.
- Something tipped you off didn't it?

21:37.555 --> 21:39.702
What was it?

21:41.957 --> 21:43.335
He didn't think I would find it.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.848
It reeked of perfume,
and it wasn't my bedding pattern.

21:46.883 --> 21:48.325
There was writing all over it.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.057
One of Adam's stupid math formulas.

21:51.092 --> 21:54.579
I knew it must have been
important to him, so I washed it,

21:54.614 --> 21:56.755
and put it back.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.391
I was waiting for him to find it.

21:59.426 --> 22:03.311
My way of saying "Screw you.
I know what you've been doing."

22:06.315 --> 22:07.870
Excuse me.

22:11.986 --> 22:14.542
That's a very unusual sound system.

22:14.577 --> 22:17.835
Adam designed it.
He was always tinkering with things.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.294
Right, I noticed that um,

22:20.329 --> 22:24.788
I noticed this speaker is
different than the other one.

22:27.031 --> 22:28.815
And here's why.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.587
Mrs. Decker,

22:30.622 --> 22:34.599
this is a camera.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.054
A camera?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.683
Someone broke into our home?

22:38.718 --> 22:40.813
Not necessarily.

22:50.067 --> 22:52.758
Is this tiny thing
really a camera?

22:52.793 --> 22:54.668
Yeah, it's a good one too.

22:54.703 --> 22:59.349
Needs almost no light, it's got
high resolution, wide field of view.

22:59.384 --> 23:01.261
Camera's not hooked up to the VCR.

23:01.296 --> 23:04.414
It's transmitting outside
of the house and uh,

23:04.449 --> 23:07.062
2.4 GHZ transmittor.

23:07.097 --> 23:09.775
Broadcasts in any
direction up to 200 feet.

23:09.810 --> 23:13.931
Someone at the airpark was
definitely spying on our dead guy.

23:13.966 --> 23:16.067
It had to be Wess.

23:16.102 --> 23:18.480
Oh, I'm sorry ma'am.
I didn't realize you were  there.

23:18.515 --> 23:19.748
It's Ok.

23:19.783 --> 23:21.240
You said Wess.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.895
You mean Adam's business partner?

23:22.930 --> 23:24.057
Yeah.

23:24.092 --> 23:26.709
Last block party,
Wess had a little too much.

23:26.744 --> 23:29.569
Accused Adam of sleeping
with his wife Cindy.

23:29.604 --> 23:32.422
He was probably trying to prove it.

23:33.765 --> 23:36.627
Look, someone was
sleeping with my wife.

23:36.662 --> 23:40.829
She was walking around humming
and smiling every weekend.

23:40.864 --> 23:42.265
It wasn't because of me.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.595
I was in Tampa all week, working.

23:44.630 --> 23:46.589
And you suspected your
business partner.

23:46.624 --> 23:49.512
I suspected every guy in
that airpark, including Adam.

23:49.547 --> 23:52.064
So you planted a camera to prove it?

23:52.099 --> 23:53.612
They had a camera too?

23:53.647 --> 23:55.413
Too?

23:55.448 --> 23:56.968
Yeah, I uh,

23:57.003 --> 23:59.904
I found a camera
in the smoke detector

23:59.939 --> 24:02.545
in our bedroom last week
when I went in to change the battery.

24:02.580 --> 24:05.775
Figured the last owners
put it in to spice things up.

24:05.810 --> 24:08.833
Two cameras, two different houses.

24:08.868 --> 24:10.600
Why stop at two?

24:14.260 --> 24:17.042
Ms. Latham I'm Calleigh Duquesne,
I'm with the Miami-Dade police department.

24:17.077 --> 24:18.765
This is my partner,Eric Delko.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.757
Hmm, let me guess.
You guys here to see Jeff again?

24:20.792 --> 24:24.405
Actually we have reason to believe
that there's a camera hidden in your home.

24:24.440 --> 24:29.654
Is this some sort of practical joke
my neighbors set you up to?

24:30.212 --> 24:32.344
What's with the stuff?

24:32.379 --> 24:34.104
Well, this is a spy finder,

24:34.139 --> 24:37.220
it will help us detect any
hidden surveillance equipment.

24:37.255 --> 24:39.760
With your permission,
we'd like to scan your home.

24:39.795 --> 24:42.359
It'll just like a check up.

24:42.478 --> 24:43.788
All right.

24:47.622 --> 24:50.839
I don't understand. I mean,
wouldn't I be able to see a camera?

24:50.874 --> 24:53.968
You'd be surprised where
a cover up camera can hide.

24:54.003 --> 24:57.510
This scanner will see
any camera that sees it.

25:08.820 --> 25:11.166
Clock radio.

25:21.951 --> 25:24.090
Oh my god.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.970
- That's aimed at...
- Your bed.

25:29.874 --> 25:31.682
I checked all three cameras,

25:31.717 --> 25:34.159
the transmittors that go
with them, and the wiring.

25:34.194 --> 25:37.428
There's not one single fingerprint
or anything we can use.

25:37.463 --> 25:39.067
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.150
- Are you having any luck?
- I think so.

25:41.185 --> 25:44.417
We know where
all of the cameras are,

25:45.441 --> 25:51.443
and we know that they all transmit
at a max of 200 feet in any direction.

25:51.478 --> 25:54.767
The receiver has to be in the overlap.

25:58.627 --> 26:01.775
Got an antenna and
a receiver up here.

26:03.557 --> 26:04.848
Wire trace?

26:04.883 --> 26:09.072
Yeah, this energizer sends
a constant signal down the wire,

26:09.107 --> 26:13.278
and this tracer tracks that signal.

26:13.313 --> 26:17.184
Well, ten bucks says its the
business partner Wess Gallagher.

26:17.219 --> 26:18.577
Oh, you're on.

26:18.612 --> 26:20.632
I'll take Mackin,
the resident stud.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.875
All right.
You're on.

26:45.084 --> 26:48.070
Ten bucks please.

26:50.227 --> 26:52.392
At least it buys us a warrant.

27:03.251 --> 27:04.081
Hey.

27:04.116 --> 27:06.101
Hey.

27:06.136 --> 27:08.237
I figured you'd take a sick day.

27:08.272 --> 27:12.836
Well, a little excitement
doesn't mean life stops, or death.

27:12.871 --> 27:18.497
Our valet, died of a brain aneurysm,
rupture in the middle cerebral artery.

27:18.532 --> 27:22.120
- What did you get?
- Explosive was lead picrate.

27:22.155 --> 27:24.197
You can basically
buy the ingriedients

27:24.232 --> 27:26.466
in any home improvement store.

27:26.501 --> 27:30.079
Real sensitive to shock, heat, friction.

27:30.114 --> 27:31.605
It was in this thing.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.122
Inside his cellphone?

27:33.157 --> 27:35.559
It's a carto.

27:35.806 --> 27:38.857
Someone rigged
our valet's cellphone?

27:38.892 --> 27:40.982
Well, I don't think it was his,

27:41.017 --> 27:43.374
cuz it costs more than
he probably makes in two weeks?

27:43.409 --> 27:44.626
He stole it.

27:44.661 --> 27:47.814
So, can you trace the phone,
GPS, something like that?

27:47.849 --> 27:50.378
The GPS is gone,
we don't need it.

27:50.413 --> 27:53.544
Take a look at that.

27:54.763 --> 27:56.403
Looks like a serial number.

27:56.438 --> 27:59.523
I'm gonna have homicide
track down the owner.

27:59.558 --> 28:03.603
I gotta finish up some of that
work on the  plane crash, but uhh,

28:03.638 --> 28:06.030
if they find anything I'll page you.

28:06.065 --> 28:07.837
Thanks Timmy.

28:16.385 --> 28:18.448
Hey hey hey hey wo wo.

28:18.483 --> 28:19.855
A warrant? For what?

28:19.890 --> 28:22.345
I couldn't have been here to
sabotage the plane cuz you know,

28:22.380 --> 28:26.732
I got witnesses that say that they saw me
at my son's birthday party down at South Beach.

28:26.767 --> 28:28.404
Tony.

28:28.439 --> 28:32.419
You've been placing video cameras
in your neighbors bedrooms.

28:32.454 --> 28:36.584
Hey, I don't know nothing
about no hidden video cameras.

28:36.619 --> 28:39.055
All right? I told you.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.732
H. / Yeah.

28:43.767 --> 28:46.634
Very nice Tony, motion activated.

28:46.669 --> 28:50.297
Now Tony, do I need to take a look at
those video tapes to know what's on them?

28:50.332 --> 28:54.160
Look, it's no harm no foul all right?

28:54.195 --> 28:55.708
You know, I mean...

28:55.743 --> 28:57.318
I just, ah...

28:57.513 --> 29:00.510
I like to watch you know and,

29:00.545 --> 29:04.435
We're all guys here,
there's no harm done?

29:04.994 --> 29:09.291
Not when one of the people
on the tapes gets murdered.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.964
There are five more
cases just like this.

29:15.999 --> 29:17.886
How long have you
been selling porn Tony?

29:17.921 --> 29:20.194
Hey, that's not illegal.

29:20.229 --> 29:23.933
It is if your stars don't know
they're on camera.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.280
Are these yours?

29:27.315 --> 29:28.650
Yeah.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.562
The 3/4 inch bit is missing.

29:30.597 --> 29:31.863
So what?

29:31.898 --> 29:35.090
That is the size of the hole
that brought Adam's plane down.

29:35.125 --> 29:38.807
Where's the bit? / Oh, man,
I loaned that to Jeff Latham.

29:38.842 --> 29:40.779
Its the guy that keyed
out on Deckers plane.

29:40.814 --> 29:44.382
Let's go talk to Jeff again.

29:44.417 --> 29:48.044
Yeah, I borrowed the drill bit,
I didn't have a 3/4 inch.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.480
But you knew that the hole
that brought Adam's plane down

29:50.515 --> 29:52.980
needed to be just
that big though, didn't you?

29:53.015 --> 29:54.196
I already told you.

29:54.231 --> 29:57.574
I don't know anything about planes,
I wouldn't know where to drill.

30:33.213 --> 30:34.726
Excuse me.

30:34.761 --> 30:36.186
- Yes?
- It's a definite match.

30:36.221 --> 30:39.625
Oh, good. Would you explain
to Mr. Latham what that means?

30:39.660 --> 30:44.698
Mr. Latham, the drill that you
borrowed makes a very distinctive hole.

30:47.848 --> 30:50.268
This is the hole from
Adam Decker's plane,

30:50.303 --> 30:51.993
this is the test hole that we made.

30:52.028 --> 30:54.241
They were both
made with the same bit.

30:54.276 --> 30:55.556
And it's the one
we found at your house.

30:55.591 --> 30:58.401
That means that that
drill bit right there

30:58.436 --> 31:01.754
is responsible for
your neighbor's murder.

31:01.789 --> 31:02.810
We spoke with Wendy,

31:02.845 --> 31:05.503
and she said her husband
flew the plane late yesterday.

31:05.538 --> 31:06.435
No problems.

31:06.470 --> 31:08.338
So whoever did it,
did it last night.

31:08.373 --> 31:10.843
Show me someone who saw
me sabotage that plane?

31:10.878 --> 31:13.227
Are you aware that we
have arrested Tony Mackin

31:13.262 --> 31:16.289
for video taping people's
bedrooms in your community,

31:16.324 --> 31:19.121
including your bedroom.

31:20.718 --> 31:25.660
Word gets around, yeah. / So you won't
mind if I take a look at the tape from last night

31:25.695 --> 31:28.858
to make sure
you didn't leave your room.

31:32.338 --> 31:34.118
As a matter of fact, I do.

31:34.153 --> 31:37.362
I'm sorry, I was just being polite.

31:54.888 --> 31:56.924
You found my phone?

31:56.959 --> 31:59.032
Have a seat.

32:02.308 --> 32:05.653
Have lunch at the
Wayfare Grill today?

32:05.688 --> 32:08.988
- Shark steak.
- Sounds delicious.

32:09.023 --> 32:13.003
A valet attendant stole
your phone from your car.

32:13.038 --> 32:16.713
I was thinking someone
from the gym stole it.

32:16.807 --> 32:19.259
So, where is it?

32:22.876 --> 32:24.313
Man!

32:24.348 --> 32:26.842
Probably doesn't look the same.

32:27.382 --> 32:30.365
- No warranty.
- That's sucks.

32:30.583 --> 32:34.194
You do realize that you blew up your
own cellphone by putting explosives in it.

32:34.229 --> 32:35.860
In the phone's battery department.

32:35.895 --> 32:37.318
So what are you crazy?

32:37.353 --> 32:38.750
Hey look.

32:38.785 --> 32:40.188
Some guys

32:40.223 --> 32:43.975
like to keep alcohol
in their car, video games.

32:44.010 --> 32:45.840
I like to go to the Everglades.

32:45.875 --> 32:47.977
Blow things up.

32:48.012 --> 32:49.590
It's a sport.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.482
It's a sport?

32:51.517 --> 32:54.276
It's fun, like fireworks.
It doesn't hurt anybody.

32:54.311 --> 32:55.883
You know, where's the harm?

32:55.918 --> 32:58.810
It's not like I'm a terrorist or anything?

32:59.120 --> 33:01.035
Well, you're looking at
three years minimum.

33:01.070 --> 33:02.795
I bought all the ingriedients legally.

33:02.830 --> 33:03.784
That doesn't matter.

33:03.819 --> 33:08.857
Possessing or manufacturing
an explosive device is a felony.

33:08.892 --> 33:11.464
This is all cuz some guy
ripped me off?

33:11.499 --> 33:14.719
That guy died of unrelated causes.

33:14.754 --> 33:18.260
But your bomb almost killed
our medical examiner.

33:18.295 --> 33:20.872
Ah, this isn't fair.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.598
- Wanna talk about fair?
- Who are they?

33:24.633 --> 33:25.846
My kids.

33:25.881 --> 33:29.167
They almost lost their mother
because you like to blow things up.

33:29.202 --> 33:30.654
So tell me,

33:30.689 --> 33:33.537
is that fair?

33:36.863 --> 33:41.446
So, I should call a lawyer? Right?

33:44.612 --> 33:45.947
Reality TV.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.311
Can I watch?

33:47.346 --> 33:49.513
Yeah, have a seat.

33:54.297 --> 33:56.736
Tell me when I have to look away.

33:56.771 --> 33:59.174
That's the thing.
You never have to.

33:59.209 --> 34:00.109
What are you telling me?

34:00.144 --> 34:06.822
I'm telling you Jeff Latham should
probably see a doctor about the little blue pill.

34:06.857 --> 34:09.743
That explains why
he didn't want us to watch the tape.

34:14.154 --> 34:15.181
That's it.

34:15.216 --> 34:17.518
Stays like that until morning.

34:18.001 --> 34:22.880
So if Jeff Latham left the room to
sabotage the plane, we'll never know.

34:25.222 --> 34:29.309
The dead guy's widow said there was
some kind of drawing on this pillow case.

34:29.344 --> 34:32.040
I tested it,
it's not ink, it's vegetable oil.

34:32.074 --> 34:35.909
And when our girl washed it,
the pigment rinsed away but

34:35.944 --> 34:38.844
oil is heavier than water,

34:38.879 --> 34:40.975
so the oil stayed
embedded in the fibers.

34:41.010 --> 34:43.181
Right, it means that
it's there we just can't see it.

34:43.216 --> 34:44.574
Ninhydrin spray.

34:44.609 --> 34:46.962
Care to do the honors?

35:06.375 --> 35:10.691
- What is it?
- Rudimentary schematic.

35:11.701 --> 35:13.382
There's some lettering.

35:13.417 --> 35:16.645
Well, it's an equation
for a chemical reaction.

35:17.294 --> 35:20.654
I was kind of expecting
it to be a love note.

35:20.689 --> 35:23.640
we used to heart with initials.

35:23.675 --> 35:25.726
What?

35:25.761 --> 35:28.490
It's a pillow case.

35:28.815 --> 35:32.485
Yeah, it's probably just
the handiest thing to write on.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.310
It's an equation for a fuel cell.

35:36.345 --> 35:39.713
Holy Grail of aviation.
Cheap power,

35:39.748 --> 35:41.519
no emissions.

35:41.554 --> 35:43.380
Is it a part of the plan that uh,

35:43.415 --> 35:45.037
new plane Decker was working on?

35:45.072 --> 35:50.532
Correct. Have we determined what
was used to write on the pillow case.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.490
- It was an oil based cosmetic.
- Based on the fine lines,

35:53.525 --> 35:55.681
I guess an eye liner. / So...

35:55.716 --> 35:58.356
we're looking for a woman.

36:02.284 --> 36:05.102
I scanned video feeds
from every bedroom.

36:05.137 --> 36:06.555
Nothing close.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.732
And then I found this one.

36:11.115 --> 36:12.912
Jeff and Heddy's bedroom.

36:12.947 --> 36:16.109
The good thing about these pin hole
cameras is that they hold focus well

36:16.144 --> 36:19.183
from very far to very close.

36:20.542 --> 36:24.265
Can we clean that up? / Yeah.

36:25.420 --> 36:27.808
Let's magnify that, Eric.

36:31.324 --> 36:33.911
Same pattern as
the one the wife found.

36:33.946 --> 36:35.682
It looks like match to me.

36:35.717 --> 36:37.420
It wasn't an affair.

36:37.455 --> 36:39.020
Pilots call it something else?

36:39.055 --> 36:41.155
Adam and I were in love.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.368
The only reason that he cut it off

36:42.403 --> 36:45.445
was cuz he was afraid that
his wife was going to find out.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.351
And she did find out.

36:48.386 --> 36:50.737
What are you talking about?

36:51.890 --> 36:55.291
I'm talking about your invention.

36:55.462 --> 36:59.856
The new fuel source for airplanes.

36:59.891 --> 37:02.378
That was one
of Adam's crazy ideas.

37:02.413 --> 37:06.013
That's not true.
This is your idea.

37:07.999 --> 37:09.870
I was thinking

37:09.905 --> 37:12.020
Why don't you show me.

37:17.956 --> 37:21.977
You have quite an impressive
academic record Mrs. Latham.

37:22.012 --> 37:24.006
Detective Salas ran you.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.004
Masters degree from MIT.

37:26.039 --> 37:29.060
Two years with one of the biggest
chemical companies in the world.

37:29.095 --> 37:31.317
And a commercial pilots rating.

37:31.352 --> 37:35.126
It's no wonder you shared your idea
with Adam. You were kindred spirits.

37:35.161 --> 37:41.051
Until he registered the pattern
in Washington behind your back.

37:41.086 --> 37:42.672
Really? I didn't know.

37:42.707 --> 37:44.639
That's not true either.

37:44.674 --> 37:47.155
There are no secrets
in your neighborhood.

37:47.190 --> 37:49.257
He took your idea Heddy,

37:49.292 --> 37:51.386
and then you took his life.

37:51.421 --> 37:53.125
You can't prove that.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.356
Or to the wise, this is
where you deny the allegation.

37:57.391 --> 37:59.507
Am I under arrest?

38:00.467 --> 38:02.548
Not yet.

38:08.958 --> 38:12.797
When you tested the drill bit
did you wear safety goggles?

38:12.832 --> 38:14.051
I did.

38:14.086 --> 38:16.458
The inflation went everywhere.

38:20.988 --> 38:23.423
Which means
she had to as well, right?

38:23.458 --> 38:24.752
Yeah.

38:24.787 --> 38:26.987
I didn't find any with Jeff's drill.

38:27.022 --> 38:30.312
Ok. Here's what we do.
Go back to the Decker hangar,

38:30.347 --> 38:33.093
where the hole was drilled.

39:28.972 --> 39:30.895
Speed.

39:30.930 --> 39:36.996
Well, so far, we have the fibers from the goggles
matching the fibers from the fire installation wall.

39:37.493 --> 39:41.266
So she sneaked in
in the middle of the night.

39:44.077 --> 39:47.154
Picked up Adam's
goggles and put them on.

39:51.840 --> 39:55.161
The mistake she made
was leaving them behind.

39:55.196 --> 39:57.078
Epithelials.

39:57.113 --> 39:59.223
Got two subjects.

39:59.258 --> 40:02.634
The first is the victim's That's a
no brainer cuz they're his goggles,

40:02.669 --> 40:06.422
and the second one didn't come
up on CODIS but the DNA is female.

40:06.457 --> 40:10.726
So we get a sample
off her, she's ours.

40:18.405 --> 40:20.474
- Where's your wife Jeff?
- I thought you were done with this.

40:20.509 --> 40:22.319
Where is she?

41:14.439 --> 41:17.036
Let's go, Heddy.

41:17.071 --> 41:19.458
Come on, Heddy.

41:27.657 --> 41:29.430
A winner.

41:31.027 --> 41:33.101
Let me see your hands, Heddy.

41:33.136 --> 41:37.385
Lie face down on
the ground right now.

41:49.902 --> 41:51.607
Well, Heddy,

41:51.642 --> 41:54.720
almost.

41:57.032 --> 41:59.176
Almost.
