00:00.960 --> 00:02.359
- Previously on Hannibal...

00:02.400 --> 00:04.368
- I've given my life to death.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.095
- Death has followed you home.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.493
- I don't think I want
to do chemotherapy.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.701
- Do I have any say in this?
- No.

00:09.740 --> 00:13.301
- I'm devoting a lot of time
to this mural, Will.
I could use your help.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.343
- What was the cause of death
in the bailiff's murder?
- Bullets.

00:16.380 --> 00:19.372
- And in Will Graham's victims?
- Mutilation.
- There are clearly

00:19.420 --> 00:21.342
two different killers
and two different cases.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.780
- Will cla_ims someone else
committed the crimes
he's accused of.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.288
- He said that person was you.
- Perhaps he was half right.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.124
- Wrap the leader

00:38.170 --> 00:41.697
around the tippet. Four,

00:41.740 --> 00:45.267
five, six times.

00:45.310 --> 00:48.074
Tuck the end

00:48.110 --> 00:50.078
between the lines.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.805
Tighten.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.512
And... trim.

00:54.550 --> 00:57.542
It's called a blood knot.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.189
Your father taught you
how to hunt.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.721
I'm going to
teach you how to fish.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.524
- Same thing, isn't it?

01:08.560 --> 01:11.529
One you stalk,
the other you lure?

01:11.570 --> 01:13.595
- One you catch,

01:13.640 --> 01:15.790
the other you shoot.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.207
- What are you trying to catch?

01:21.210 --> 01:23.178
- The one who caught you.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.747
- The one that got away.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.816
- Catch a fish once

01:27.850 --> 01:31.115
and it gets away, it's
a lot harder to catch again.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.352
(chuckling)

01:40.160 --> 01:43.823
- Everybody thinks you're lying
about the one that got away.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.464
- That's why
I have to catch him.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.668
Last thing before
casting a line:

01:54.710 --> 01:57.247
name the bait
on your hook

01:57.280 --> 01:59.475
after somebody
you cherished.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.909
- To say goodbye?

02:01.950 --> 02:04.180
- If the person you name it
after cherished you,

02:04.220 --> 02:06.415
as the superstition goes,
you will catch the fish.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.725
- Oh.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.751
And what did you name it?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.291
- Abigail.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.778
(creaking sound)

02:41.590 --> 02:44.479
- You were right.
Killer was in the mural.

02:44.530 --> 02:48.421
Just where you said he'd be.
His name was James Gray.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.325
We found his vehicle
outside the farm.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.429
Enough DNA on the bed of his
truck for us to be confident

02:52.470 --> 02:56.406
he's the Muralist.
- You found as much evidence
on him as you did on me.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.432
- I'm glad you said it.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.675
- Who stitched him
into the mural?

03:01.710 --> 03:05.476
- We don't know.
He may have had a partner.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.375
Another killer. Maybe
they had a suicide pact.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.786
- There was no partner.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.688
This artist worked alone
until he was stitched
into his own creation.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.553
- No signs of a struggle.
- No.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.718
So, this second killer,
whoever he is,

03:19.760 --> 03:22.263
understood the Muralist
well enough

03:22.300 --> 03:25.292
not just to find his canvas,
but well enough to convince him

03:25.330 --> 03:27.594
to be part of it.
- You have an idea
who that might be?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.269
- I do.
- Don't say, "Hannibal Lecter."

03:31.310 --> 03:34.837
- I'm saying Hannibal Lecter.
- Didn't you stop ringing
that bell?

03:34.880 --> 03:38.577
- I'm not asking you to believe
anything you can't prove.
I'm just asking you

03:38.610 --> 03:42.341
to prove it.
- Hannibal Lecter has no reason-
- That IS exactly right.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.483
He has no discernible reason
other than

03:44.520 --> 03:46.613
his own amusement and curiosity.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.481
- That's hard to prove.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.589
- There will be _
a very clever detail

03:51.630 --> 03:53.757
to find
on James Gray.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.519
He wouldn't be able
to resist it. Probably something

03:56.570 --> 04:00.438
that was overlooked.
Something hidden.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.531
- I'll look for clever details.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.902
But I'm not looking
for Hannibal.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.670
- Just as long
as you're looking.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.389
You look out there.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.411
I'll look in here.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.879
(bee buzzing)

04:26.560 --> 04:30.769
(buzzing)

04:58.560 --> 05:01.859
***

05:23.020 --> 05:26.888
I'll give you the same deal
I gave Beverly Katz.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.457
I know you know
what it is.

05:29.490 --> 05:32.596
You've been recording
our conversations.

05:32.630 --> 05:35.997
Or are we pretending
you didn't?

05:36.030 --> 05:38.396
- What "this" are you
offering in exchange

05:38.430 --> 05:40.660
for my "that"?
- I'm quite the topic

05:40.700 --> 05:44.534
_ of conversation
In psychiatric Circles.

05:44.570 --> 05:47.539
(chuckling)

05:47.580 --> 05:50.970
- I shared my diagnosis of you
on the witness stand.

05:51.010 --> 05:54.548
Your personality disorders,

05:54.580 --> 05:56.810
neuroses-- all forgeries.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.818
- Even if that were true,
I'd still be a psychopath

05:58.850 --> 06:00.818
of some interest.
- Mm.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.885
Quite a manipulative
one at that.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.649
Poor, confused, wounded bird

06:05.690 --> 06:08.727
for Agent Crawford and
Doctors Lecter and Bloom.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.160
And for me, well,

06:11.200 --> 06:14.397
I get the psychopath's
triumvirate: charm,

06:14.440 --> 06:17.000
focus, and ruthlessness.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.008
The charm being
debateable, of course.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.975
- So, either I'm a psychopath

06:22.010 --> 06:24.672
or I am delusional.

06:24.710 --> 06:28.419
Or I'm right about Hannibal
Lecter. Aren't you curious

06:28.450 --> 06:31.578
which one it is?

06:31.620 --> 06:35.010
- Will you allow me to test you?
- Test me?

06:35.060 --> 06:38.621
I'll take 'em all.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.788
You will be the first
and last word in the mind

06:41.830 --> 06:45.721
of Will Graham. God, you could
dine out on that for years.

06:45.770 --> 06:49.035
- What about Dr. Lecter?

06:49.070 --> 06:51.106
- Shouldn't you be

06:51.140 --> 06:53.199
my one and only psychiatrist,
Dr. Chilton?

06:53.240 --> 06:56.107
- Ideally.
- Well then,

06:56.140 --> 06:58.176
as to your "that"

06:58.210 --> 07:00.917
for my "this."

07:00.950 --> 07:03.817
Do not discuss me or my therapy

07:03.850 --> 07:05.784
with Hannibal Lecter.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.153
Tell him that you've
decided I am no longer

07:09.190 --> 07:11.420
any of his business.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.722
I am now under

07:15.760 --> 07:19.093
your exclusive care.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.732
- Lazarus had it good.

07:24.770 --> 07:27.079
My social circle
doesn't include a friend

07:27.110 --> 07:30.170
with power over death.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.576
I suppose I should've
embraced Facebook

07:32.620 --> 07:34.770
while I had the chance.
(chuckling)

07:46.600 --> 07:48.693
I never should have
let Jack talk me

07:48.730 --> 07:51.267
into taking chemo.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.268
- He's trying to
extend your life.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.734
- He's trying to extend
a quality of life

07:55.770 --> 07:57.533
that's not
worth the effort.

07:57.570 --> 08:00.209
- Jack's efforts or yours?

08:02.240 --> 08:05.539
- I'm vomiting
my stomach lining.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.651
fifteen to eighteen hours.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.783
On a bad day, I don't sleep.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.890
My best-case
scenario

08:20.930 --> 08:24.969
is prolonged pain management.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.537
- Jack will help you manage.

08:29.670 --> 08:33.276
He loves you, Bella.

08:33.310 --> 08:36.871
When you are gone, he will feel
your silence like a draft.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.071
- My silence

08:39.110 --> 08:41.715
is inevitable.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.947
The war is over.

08:44.990 --> 08:49.211
The cancer is
an occupying force.

08:49.260 --> 08:52.229
I want to surrender.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.798
While I still
have my dignity.

08:58.730 --> 09:02.632
- You are considering
ending your life?
- Suicide seems

09:02.670 --> 09:06.106
like a valid solution
to my problem.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.749
- How does that
make you feel?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.184
- Alive.

09:20.290 --> 09:23.123
How does it make you feel?

09:25.930 --> 09:29.195
- I've always found the idea
of death comforting.

09:29.230 --> 09:32.666
The thought that my life
could end at any moment

09:32.700 --> 09:35.669
frees me to fully appreciate

09:35.700 --> 09:37.736
the beauty, and art,

09:37.770 --> 09:39.738
and horror

09:39.780 --> 09:41.839
of everything
this world has to offer.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.769
- A death benefit?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.869
- Upon taking his
own life, Socrates

09:46.920 --> 09:50.117
offered a rooster to the god
of healing, Asclepius,

09:50.150 --> 09:52.015
to pay his debt.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.315
- What debt might that be?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.681
- To Socrates, death
was not a defeat...

09:59.930 --> 10:01.921
...but a cure.

10:09.870 --> 10:13.203
- Gentlemen...

10:13.240 --> 10:16.038
Local police were supposed
to exterminate the bees

10:16.080 --> 10:18.799
so we could work the
crime scene. Apparently,
someone shut that down.

10:18.850 --> 10:21.717
- I did.
- He did.
- Jimmy?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.911
- Well, I love bees.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.657
Did you know that the drone

10:26.690 --> 10:29.215
is nature's most talented
swcrdal swordsman?

10:29.260 --> 10:31.228
When the drone
mates with the queen,

10:31.260 --> 10:33.694
his ejaculation
is so explosive,

10:33.730 --> 10:35.698
it's audible
to the human ear.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.391
- All right.

10:37.430 --> 10:41.799
- How long has he been out here?
- Ah, from de-comp,

10:41.840 --> 10:44.866
I'd estimate two weeks.
- Which makes sense with how
much honey is being produced.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.769
- Do bees naturally hive
in human carcasses like this?

10:49.810 --> 10:53.678
- No. The victim was purposely
repurposed as a human apiary.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.676
- Purposely.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.981
of the brain to
make room for the hive.

11:03.190 --> 11:06.694
- Zeller's out in the field,
otherwise I'd ask him
to help me with this.

11:06.730 --> 11:09.153
You were a surgeon, right?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.169
- I was a surgeon and
a doctor, yes. Have you found

11:12.200 --> 11:14.395
any evidence on
the Muralist's friend?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.807
- That's what
I need your help with.
Might not have been a friend.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.831
Might not have even
been an acquaintance.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.836
Whoever killed him,
understood him.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.098
- So often you open your mouth

11:24.150 --> 11:26.971
and I hear Will Graham's
words come out.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.319
- I have an arrangement
with Will.

11:30.350 --> 11:33.285
He's agreed to consult
with me on cases,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.857
ifI keep investigating
the murders he's accused of.

11:35.890 --> 11:39.189
- I'm happy to hear that.

11:39.230 --> 11:42.358
Will needs a champion
now more than ever.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.221
- He has you, doesn't he?

11:45.270 --> 11:48.239
You think there's a chance
he could be innocent.
I know you do.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.266
- I believe there is
a possibility.

11:52.310 --> 11:55.734
- I'm just relieved he's not
saying the killer is you
anymore.

11:55.780 --> 11:59.102
- At least not to me.

12:00.950 --> 12:03.043
Who does Will believe
killed the Muralist?

12:03.090 --> 12:05.046
- Doesn't know.

12:05.090 --> 12:07.354
He thinks if
James Gray's killer

12:07.390 --> 12:09.210
hid him in the mural, he may
have hid something else.

12:09.260 --> 12:12.752
- A signature?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.950
What kind
of killer

12:15.000 --> 12:18.868
seeks to depict the unconscious,
instinctual striving
of his victim

12:18.900 --> 12:21.869
by sewing him into
his own human mural?

12:21.900 --> 12:25.063
- It wasn't just
for appearances.

12:25.110 --> 12:28.978
- You have to get to the truth
beneath the appearances.

12:29.010 --> 12:32.912
Only by going deep beneath
the skin will you understand

12:32.950 --> 12:35.919
the nature of this
killer's pathology.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.983
_- Before I start
asking you questions,

12:45.030 --> 12:47.954
I need _some confidence that
you Will be telling the truth

12:48.000 --> 12:50.992
when you answer.
- What's this?

12:51.030 --> 12:53.294
- A consent form.
You're agreeing

12:53.340 --> 12:56.161
to a narcoanalytic
interview. You. Me.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.805
And our old friend,
sodium amytal.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.899
- A little something
to loosen my tongue?

13:00.940 --> 13:03.170
- Something lawfully
used in the evaluation

13:03.210 --> 13:05.007
of psychotic patients.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.177
- What would you use

13:07.220 --> 13:09.984
to induce memory loss in a
patient, psychotic or otherwise?

13:10.020 --> 13:13.888
- The protein synthesis
that moves memories

13:13.920 --> 13:17.856
from short-term to long-term
can be interrupted,

13:17.890 --> 13:21.098
but that requires
tools and skills.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.860
And a certain level
of unorthodoxy.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.937
- Does Hannibal Lecter possess
those tools and skills?

13:26.970 --> 13:30.360
- Dr. Lecter has indicated
to me that he is open

13:30.410 --> 13:33.299
_ to the unorthodox when
it comes to treating patients.

13:33.340 --> 13:35.308
- I wonder how that
subject came up...

13:35.340 --> 13:38.400
Sharing stories
of the unorthodox.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.272
- Sign here.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.377
- I want you to draw
a clock for me.

14:52.650 --> 14:56.086
- (muffled): Did Dr. Lecter
administer any drug therapies

14:56.120 --> 14:57.951
during your sessions together?

14:57.990 --> 15:00.356
Sedatives...

15:08.000 --> 15:10.707
- The stro_be causes neurons
to fire en masse,

15:10.740 --> 15:14.005
like striking many
piano keys at once.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.116
The strobe causes neurons
to fire en masse,

15:20.150 --> 15:23.039
like striking many...

15:24.590 --> 15:28.219
The dissonance might foster
a change in your mind.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.929
Is something wrong?

15:39.770 --> 15:42.398
- Will...?

15:46.210 --> 15:48.599
- He was inducing seizures.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.279
He was encouraging them.
The blackouts.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.449
The lost time.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.984
It was strategic.
It was planned.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.308
- You would only see a seizure
response in a brain

16:01.360 --> 16:03.658
afflicted with
photosensitive epilepsy.

16:03.690 --> 16:06.523
- Or afflicted by something
just as damaging.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.551
Like encephalitis.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.165
- That would suggest a radically
unorthodox form of therapy.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.236
- Yes, it would.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.539
- Dr. Lecter.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.013
I am so embarrassed.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.016
You didn't get my message?

16:36.060 --> 16:38.688
I canceled
your appomtment

16:38.730 --> 16:40.755
with Will Graham.
- Is everything all right?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.462
- I can explain.
Shall we?

16:47.700 --> 16:50.737
Will is at _a delicate
p0int in his therapy.

16:50.770 --> 16:54.399
I don't want to confuse him
any more than he already IS.
- Confuse him?

16:54.440 --> 16:58.069
Isn't it your opinion he's
an intelligent psychopath?
- It was,

16:58.110 --> 17:00.817
but my opinion is evolving.

17:00.850 --> 17:05.389
After administering a
narcoanalytic interview,

17:05.420 --> 17:08.059
therapeutically vital
information has come to light.

17:08.090 --> 17:11.457
- What sort of information?
- What Will Graham suffers from

17:11.490 --> 17:14.653
may not be a single condition,
but a continuum

17:14.700 --> 17:16.520
of illnesses, all with different

17:16.560 --> 17:19.427
neurological mechanisms.
Some naturally occurring,

17:19.470 --> 17:23.167
others appear to have
been induced.
-Induced?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.565
Induced by whom?

17:25.610 --> 17:28.534
- Did you ever use any kind
of light stimulation

17:28.580 --> 17:30.571
in your treatment?

17:30.610 --> 17:33.613
- Light stimulation is a
standard tool for neurotherapy.

17:33.650 --> 17:36.847
- Evidently, it was overloading
his visual cortex.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.383
Creating seizures,
time loss,

17:39.420 --> 17:41.559
gaps in his memory.

17:41.590 --> 17:44.184
Almost strategically,
it seems.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.152
- You're suggesting
it was intentional?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.168
- All our conversations
about psychic drivmg.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.668
You were so curious and eager
to hear what I had to say

17:53.700 --> 17:56.669
while saying
very little yourself.
- I had very little to say.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.669
- I have been thinking
about the possibility

17:59.710 --> 18:03.248
that you may have been psychic
driving Will Graham all along.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.144
- A bold accusation,
Frederick.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.740
- You are not the only
psychiatrist accused of
making a patient kill.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.526
We have to
stick together.

18:23.730 --> 18:26.324
- Last time I did this,

18:26.370 --> 18:28.634
this isn't how I did this.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.809
The young man at the dispensary

18:30.840 --> 18:33.673
calls this "purple kush."

18:43.720 --> 18:45.688
He says

18:45.720 --> 18:48.257
all his_
cancer patients

18:48.290 --> 18:52.226
love its "deep body stone."
(chuckling)

18:52.260 --> 18:55.593
- May I?

18:55.630 --> 18:58.758
- Do you still get drug tested?
- Oh, come on, gimme that thing.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.905
I'm supporting my wife.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.818
- I filled out my advance
directive today.

19:17.850 --> 19:20.785
I added a DNR.

19:20.820 --> 19:24.358
- Oh, you are harshing
my buzz right now.

19:24.390 --> 19:27.951
I read an article
the other day

19:28.000 --> 19:30.491
about magnetic hyperthermia.

19:30.530 --> 19:33.738
It's looking promising
as a treatment

19:33.770 --> 19:36.762
for lung cancer.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.571
- Come here.

19:48.580 --> 19:52.744
I know what to expect
from lung cancer.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.657
I am my mother's daughter,

19:55.690 --> 19:58.727
and I watched her
go through exactly

19:58.760 --> 20:01.695
what I am going through now.
- I know.

20:01.730 --> 20:05.268
- Hey... I remember

20:05.300 --> 20:07.860
sitting by her bed

20:07.900 --> 20:09.959
when she woke up
in so much pain

20:10.000 --> 20:12.400
that all she could do
was scream my name.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.973
I didn't know
how to help her.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.001
So I did nothing.

20:19.050 --> 20:20.938
- There was nothing
you could do.

20:20.980 --> 20:23.687
- And there will be a time
when there is nothing

20:23.720 --> 20:25.984
you can do.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.581
And I don't want you
to remember me

20:29.620 --> 20:33.829
pleading with you
to make the pain go away.

20:33.860 --> 20:38.263
- Oh, I'm not going
to remember you that way.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.791
First of all,
I'm going to remember you

20:40.840 --> 20:43.866
walking along the quays
of Italy in the sunshine

20:43.910 --> 20:46.538
with a trail of signori
behind you

20:46.570 --> 20:49.733
shouting "bella,
bella, bella."

20:49.780 --> 20:52.499
And I'm going to remember

20:52.550 --> 20:55.644
that your hands...

20:55.680 --> 20:59.514
that they smelled of thyme when
you came in from the garden.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.518
And garlic and onions

21:01.560 --> 21:04.950
every time you left the kitchen.
(laughing)

21:07.360 --> 21:10.864
I'm going to remember you as
beautiful as you are right now.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.788
- Well, good.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.301
Good.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.784
- Duncan Halloran,
fifty-two, divorced, bankrupt.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.856
Reported missing
six months ago.

21:38.890 --> 21:41.393
- And what do we know
about his death?

21:41.430 --> 21:44.593
- Considering any post-mortem
morphological changes, this
guy's white blood cell count

21:44.630 --> 21:46.689
was through the roof
when he died.
- You're telling me

21:46.730 --> 21:49.369
his killer was a_ fever_
and/or a masswe infection?

21:49.400 --> 21:52.506
- Lock 'em both up.
- No family. No money.

21:52.540 --> 21:55.373
No reason to live.
Alive, dead, or dying,

21:55.410 --> 21:57.469
who put him under the tree?
- It's possible

21:57.510 --> 22:00.479
we're dealing with
a highly motivated
religious individual here.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.479
- Explain.
- In Hinduism, honey is one of
the five elixirs of immortality.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.489
In Christianity, the bee
is considered to be

22:07.520 --> 22:11.024
an emblem of Christ; his
mildness and mercy on one side,

22:11.060 --> 22:14.598
his Old Testament
justice on the other.
- OK. The orbital bone,

22:14.630 --> 22:17.861
his sphenoid, um, behind where
the eyeballs would usually be,

22:17.900 --> 22:20.698
there's tiny punctures.
Something long and sharp

22:20.740 --> 22:23.038
was pushed in his brain.

22:23.070 --> 22:26.836
Jack, this guy was lobotomized.

22:30.780 --> 22:34.546
- How are you feeling today?
- Not well.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.038
My arthritis is killing me.
I can't take much more of it.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.548
- A course of bee venom
therapy would soothe

22:41.590 --> 22:43.581
the inflammation.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.723
- I can barely afford
this treatment.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.797
- That's a problem
for another day.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.469
Now,

22:51.500 --> 22:54.936
you just quiet your mind.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.859
Just live in the present.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.737
You feel that?
- No.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.805
- Good.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.512
You feel that?

23:07.550 --> 23:09.939
- No.
- Good.

23:13.220 --> 23:15.154
Feel that?

23:15.190 --> 23:18.421
- I can't feel anything.

23:18.460 --> 23:21.497
- Good.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.860
Then you won't
feel this...

23:36.880 --> 23:41.544
(whimpering)

24:12.880 --> 24:14.108
- Mister,

24:14.150 --> 24:17.074
you're not supposed
to stare at the sun.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.816
It'll hurt
your eyes.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.084
(The girl screams.)

24:30.160 --> 24:34.130
- Multiple holes on this guy.
Over a dozen.

24:34.170 --> 24:36.593
Both eye sockets.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.767
The-the lesions have severed

24:38.810 --> 24:40.675
most of the nerve tract
in the frontal lobe.

24:40.710 --> 24:43.804
- He's covered in bee stings
like he got swarmed.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.842
Must be floating in apitoxin,
or he doesn't feel a thing.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.610
- Yeah, the not feeling anything
has got nothing to do
with bee stings.

24:49.650 --> 24:52.539
Welcome to the world
of the living dead.

24:52.590 --> 24:53.852
- There's a pattern.

24:53.890 --> 24:56.882
- Hey.
- Hey...

24:56.920 --> 25:00.128
Look what the cat's dragged in.
- What are you looking at?

25:00.160 --> 25:02.799
- (both): A pattern.

25:02.830 --> 25:06.163
- See, some of the bee stings
triggered an allergic reaction,
others didn't.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.566
- The inflamed bee stings
were all in line

25:08.600 --> 25:11.137
with the body's meridian,
on acupuncture points.

25:11.170 --> 25:14.833
The bee stings are
hiding the needle marks.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.199
- What did you say?

25:16.240 --> 25:20.040
- Uh, the bee stings are
hiding the needle marks?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.744
- Stitches are hiding stitches.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.318
- Only by going deep
beneath the skin

25:57.350 --> 26:01.787
will you understand the nature
of this killer's pathology.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.789
- He took his kidney.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.729
- I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

26:18.770 --> 26:23.104
Tell me if he's real.

26:23.140 --> 26:26.678
- I don't see anyone.
- No, he's right there.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.076
- There's no one there.
- You're lying.
- We're alone.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.213
You came here alone. Do you
remember coming alone?

26:31.250 --> 26:33.980
- Please don't lie to me.
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs is dead.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.820
You killed him.
You watched him die.
- What's happening to me?

26:37.860 --> 26:41.159
- Will. Will, you're having

26:41.200 --> 26:43.691
an episode. I want you
to hand me the gun.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.324
Will, I want you
to hand me your...

26:46.370 --> 26:48.861
Will...

27:07.090 --> 27:10.355
He's had a mild seizure.

27:10.390 --> 27:13.928
- That... doesn't seem
to bother you.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.827
- I said it was mild.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.976
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

27:31.780 --> 27:34.340
- Why do you say "claimed"?

27:34.380 --> 27:37.042
- Because you're not.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.685
You know you're not and
you don't know much more

27:39.720 --> 27:41.881
about who you are
beyond that.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.981
- Are you
the Ripper?

27:49.500 --> 27:52.799
- A terrible thing,

27:52.830 --> 27:55.333
to have your identity
taken from you.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.428
- Whoever killed James Gray
didn't just take his leg.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.020
Sutures hidden
beneath the stitching

28:24.070 --> 28:26.095
that wove him into the mural.
One crime made to look
like another.

28:26.130 --> 28:29.293
- Like the Copycat.

28:29.340 --> 28:33.265
And...

28:33.310 --> 28:35.904
the Chesapeake Ripper.

28:35.940 --> 28:39.478
- Now you're saying Hannibal
Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper?
- I'm saying

28:39.510 --> 28:42.513
also the Chesapeake Ripper.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.939
Um...

28:44.990 --> 28:46.912
were the kidneys
surgically removed?

28:46.950 --> 28:49.817
- Yes.
- Dr. Lecter was a surgeon.

28:49.860 --> 28:53.079
- I know he was. I asked him to
consult on James Gray's autopsy.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.328
- You what?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.920
If you invited him

28:59.970 --> 29:02.029
with an actual agenda,
Hannibal would know it.

29:02.070 --> 29:04.368
- He pointed me to the evidence.
- He pointed you

29:04.410 --> 29:06.503
to an absence of evidence.

29:06.540 --> 29:08.906
He's baiting a hook, Beverly.

29:08.940 --> 29:12.171
He's toying with you.
Go to Jack. Tell him everything.

29:12.210 --> 29:15.475
- I can't bring this to Jack
until I can back it up.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.785
- Stay away

29:18.820 --> 29:21.050
from Hannibal Lecter.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.888
- The Chesapeake Ripper
kept surgical trophies.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.525
If Hannibal's the ripper, what's
he doing with his trophies?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.970
(crows cawing)

29:53.520 --> 29:56.011
- He's eating them.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.417
(knocking)

30:25.390 --> 30:28.314
- Katherine Pimms?
- Yes.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.510
- I'm Special Agent
Jack Crawford with the FBI.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.482
This is Agent Zeller
and Agent Price.

30:32.530 --> 30:35.522
We'd like to speak
with you about two
of your former patients.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.097
- Would you like to come in?

30:38.130 --> 30:41.258
- When was the last time you saw
Duncan Halloran or Lloyd Roat?

30:41.300 --> 30:43.939
- Whenever our last
appomtments were.

30:43.970 --> 30:47.599
I can check in my calendar,
if you want.
- Sure.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.631
- Have you found them?
- Yes, we have.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.944
Mr. Halloran is deceased.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.438
And Mr. Roat
might as well be.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.243
- Whew...

30:59.090 --> 31:02.582
Poor Mr. Halloran...
- What were you
treating him for?

31:02.620 --> 31:06.488
- That man trudged
from disease to disease.

31:06.530 --> 31:09.954
He _had severe_ combined
immunodefICIency.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.219
Life didn't seem
to be going his way.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.295
Please.
- Thank you.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.138
- Hm...

31:21.180 --> 31:23.603
I find that, uh,

31:23.640 --> 31:27.440
people don't get their own way

31:27.480 --> 31:29.675
because, um,

31:29.720 --> 31:32.541
they often don't know themselves

31:32.590 --> 31:36.412
where that way leads.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.224
Mr. Halloran,
he couldn't envision

31:39.260 --> 31:41.626
a dignified end of life.

31:41.660 --> 31:45.061
So, it's much nicer to die,

31:45.100 --> 31:48.661
well, for him,
to die in a meadow,

31:48.700 --> 31:52.204
a head full of bees.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.368
Have you tried the honey?
- No.

31:58.410 --> 32:01.573
- I couldn't bring myself to
either. It seemed

32:01.620 --> 32:04.316
too morbid.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.409
- So you left him in the field

32:06.450 --> 32:08.714
to die?
- I brought him

32:08.760 --> 32:12.628
to the field to die.
I didn't kill him.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.651
I quieted his mind

32:14.700 --> 32:16.725
so that he could
die in peace.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.695
- And Mr. Roat?

32:19.730 --> 32:23.234
You quieted his mind, too?
- Oh, him.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.329
He suffered

32:25.370 --> 32:28.373
crippling arthritis.

32:28.410 --> 32:31.208
After he was quieted...

32:33.210 --> 32:36.976
...I saw him walk pain-free
for the very first time

32:37.020 --> 32:39.488
in his life.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.217
I can't make pain go away,

32:43.260 --> 32:46.582
but I can make it so that
it doesn't matter.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.463
I-I protected them.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.139
I protected these people

32:54.170 --> 32:56.434
from hopelessness.

32:56.470 --> 33:00.406
And that's beautiful.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.644
- Please come in.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.614
- It's a little unnerving,

33:11.650 --> 33:15.188
not being able to walk
across the floor.

33:15.220 --> 33:18.781
- Nothing can be so unnerving
for someone strong

33:18.830 --> 33:21.298
as being weak.

33:23.530 --> 33:27.227
- I was so weak
after chemotherapy,

33:27.270 --> 33:30.239
Jack had to
physically pick me up.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.636
It was the second time

33:32.670 --> 33:34.774
he carried me
across the threshold.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.108
I brought you something.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.141
- A gift?

33:47.390 --> 33:50.416
- Paying my debt.

33:50.460 --> 33:53.384
- Coq Gaulois.

33:53.430 --> 33:56.319
- For helping me understand

33:56.360 --> 33:59.363
that death is not a defeat,

33:59.400 --> 34:02.233
but a cure.

34:12.410 --> 34:14.378
- What have you taken, Bella?

34:14.420 --> 34:17.378
- My morphine.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.411
Every bit of it.

34:24.330 --> 34:27.822
I didn't want to die at home.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.749
I didn't want Jack to find me.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.830
I didn't want him
to make that call...

34:38.570 --> 34:42.734
...to be in the room
with my body,

34:42.780 --> 34:46.204
waiting...

34:46.250 --> 34:50.311
for it to become_
some ceremonial object

34:50.350 --> 34:53.148
apart from him,

34:53.190 --> 34:56.682
separate

34:56.720 --> 34:59.621
from who I was,

34:59.660 --> 35:02.857
someone he can only...

35:06.430 --> 35:08.762
...hold in his mind.

35:15.810 --> 35:19.405
- You denied him his goodbye.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.715
- I denied him...

35:22.750 --> 35:26.811
a painful goodbye.

35:30.660 --> 35:34.323
And allowed myself
a peaceful one.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.795
Tell Jack...

35:45.710 --> 35:49.271
...I love him very much.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.403
- Yes.

35:58.950 --> 36:01.510
- Goodbye,

36:01.560 --> 36:04.188
Dr. Lecter.

36:28.450 --> 36:30.441
- Goodbye, Bella.

37:49.430 --> 37:51.819
- No...

37:56.400 --> 37:59.005
No...

37:59.040 --> 38:02.339
(whimpering)

38:13.650 --> 38:16.312
- Hey. Have you seen Jack?

38:16.360 --> 38:18.328
- Oh. No, no, no,
there was, uh,

38:18.360 --> 38:20.624
some emergency with his wife.
Dr. Lecter called

38:20.660 --> 38:22.753
from the hospital,
asked him to come down.
- Is Mrs. Crawford okay?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.961
- I don't know.
He didn't say.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.299
- So Hannibal's
at the hospital, too?

38:40.580 --> 38:42.810
(moaning softly)

38:50.820 --> 38:53.880
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.561
- I'm here.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.659
I'm here.

39:18.750 --> 39:22.117
- What are you
doing here?

39:24.120 --> 39:26.122
- I want to
apologize.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.992
I couldn't honor
what you asked of me.

39:42.010 --> 39:44.843
I'm sorry.

39:52.550 --> 39:55.087
(coughing)

39:59.560 --> 40:01.551
- Get out.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.711
- Gotcha.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.191
(creaking)

42:05.950 --> 42:08.748
Oh, my God.

42:20.970 --> 42:24.861
(gunshots)
