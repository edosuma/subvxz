WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:07.510
Where's your dignity?

00:07.520 --> 00:08.910
I'm celebrating my freedom.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.670
I thought it was about me dad.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.750
I've no interest in him.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.310
I'm going in as an out-patient,
to get my meds assessed.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.310
Have you been here
this whole time?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.870
I'm not sure.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.350
Frank, my Frank!

00:20.360 --> 00:24.350
I never doubted you for a second!

00:25.680 --> 00:28.630
Anyone watching, thinking
they know fuck all

00:28.640 --> 00:32.630
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:32.720 --> 00:35.830
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:35.840 --> 00:38.230
sending prices sky high...

00:38.240 --> 00:42.150
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:42.160 --> 00:45.030
Now you've got
your ConDemNation...

00:45.040 --> 00:48.070
Liberals noshing Tories like altar
boys picking dimps up!

00:48.080 --> 00:51.950
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:51.960 --> 00:55.870
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:55.880 --> 00:57.550
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:57.560 --> 01:01.230
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.230
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

01:05.360 --> 01:08.430
and they charge us for water!

01:08.440 --> 01:12.430
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.590
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.590
Yak yak yak yak!

01:18.600 --> 01:22.030
It's not theirs any more.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.350
This is our England now.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.350
Paaaarty!

01:43.200 --> 01:46.110
People get confused about freedom,
as a concept.

01:46.120 --> 01:49.470
They think freedom concerns
human rights.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.630
You know, freedom of speech,
freedom of expression,

01:51.640 --> 01:54.150
blah, blah, fucking blah.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.830
All bollocks.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.830
The meaning of the word has been
distorted beyond recognition,

01:59.840 --> 02:02.870
sliced up like it can be
quantified.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.390
I'll see your freedom of assembly

02:04.400 --> 02:08.389
and raise you freedom
of association.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.670
Queen, seven, six, yeah?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.910
Now, OK, who wants a card?

02:19.920 --> 02:22.070
Hit me.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.510
Queen to the Chezer,
Big Bullto Tab-lations.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.510
'Ask any one of these muppets
about freedom, and they'll tell you,

02:28.520 --> 02:32.510
'you've no idea what it is
until it's been taken from you.'

02:32.680 --> 02:36.190
Three to the dealer,
which was my size

02:36.200 --> 02:39.230
when I came out of those bastard
freezing showers earlier.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.230
Who wants a card?

02:40.240 --> 02:42.550
Hit me.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.590
No, you...

02:43.600 --> 02:47.430
No, look, you've fucking
already got 20!

02:47.440 --> 02:49.710
All right, I'll get to you.
Fuckin'...

02:49.720 --> 02:53.710
Eh, Scanlon, Scanlon, who was up
front for City last night?

02:55.080 --> 02:57.070
Medication time,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:57.080 --> 02:57.950
Hit me.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.390
I will in a minute...

02:59.400 --> 03:00.350
Scanlon!

03:00.360 --> 03:02.790
Scanner... When, what?

03:02.800 --> 03:06.590
I just... I... you know...
take me now.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.990
All right, buddy.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.390
Eh, where do you think she keeps
her loose change?

03:11.400 --> 03:15.390
There, or there?!

03:16.280 --> 03:19.430
Eh, come on.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.910
Scanner!

03:21.920 --> 03:25.230
He can't...

03:25.240 --> 03:27.470
Excuse me, love, excuse me, love...

03:27.480 --> 03:30.350
Do you think you could just
turn the music down a bit,

03:30.360 --> 03:34.350
so that perhaps the boys don't
need to SHOUT to be heard?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.830
Don't get upset, Mr Gallagher.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.830
We have a lot of old people on this ward who
wouldn't hear the music if we turned it lower.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.110
When I'm gone, they can have it
as loud as they want...

03:44.120 --> 03:48.110
You're not going anywhere.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.990
Oh, really?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.830
And what part of blowing your
examiner in nursing school

03:53.840 --> 03:57.430
qualifies you to
make that decision?

03:57.440 --> 04:01.070
As it happens, the length
of your stay is largely my decision.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.590
I make a recommendation
and the panel act on it.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.110
An abusive potty-mouth is unlikely
to strengthen your case.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.350
Potty Mouth?!

04:09.360 --> 04:10.550
Potty Mouth!

04:10.560 --> 04:12.350
Am I being hospitalised
in the 1950s?

04:12.360 --> 04:16.149
Is James Robertson-Justice
doing the rounds?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.110
Your medication.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.149
What's in it?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.110
There's no need to be squeamish.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.430
If you don't want to
take the drugs orally,

04:23.440 --> 04:24.950
we can find another way!

04:24.960 --> 04:27.990
Squeamish about drugs? Me?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.150
I have never been so insulted.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.150
I was just trying to figure out
a way how to get his and hers

04:33.160 --> 04:37.150
and hers.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.190
You were talking about sticking them
pills up my arse, weren't you?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.870
'Visiting is two until four,
and is permitted

04:55.880 --> 04:59.870
'entirely at the discretion
of the clinical consultant.'

05:00.440 --> 05:04.430
Thank you, that was just as helpful
the first twice you told me.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.950
My fiancee was suffering memory
loss until very recently.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.670
Familiar objects
or faces might be of value.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.670
Couldn't you make an exception,
just this once?

05:20.040 --> 05:22.230
'No.'

05:22.240 --> 05:24.630
I want to speak to
someone in charge.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.830
Get me the chief...

05:26.840 --> 05:28.030
psychiatrist.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.190
'Yeah, that's me.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.350
'I'm the chief psychiatrist.
What do you want?'

05:31.360 --> 05:32.750
Don't be ridiculous.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.790
You're an arsehole in a crew-neck!

05:34.800 --> 05:38.110
I want someone who stayed
on at school beyond year nine.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.110
'All right. Just a minute.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.790
'Hello? Yeah, it's me,
the professor.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.510
'What can I do you for?'

05:50.520 --> 05:54.510
Frank!

05:56.040 --> 05:58.670
BABY CRIES

05:58.680 --> 06:00.550
Can I have another one, Jay?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.310
What's wrong with that one?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.910
Nothing. It's just...

06:03.920 --> 06:05.310
You're not missing him?

06:05.320 --> 06:09.310
He's been gone three week and I'm only
now getting his stink out me nostrils.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.470
But? It's the one time
it genuinely in't his fault.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.870
And we're like "We know him
better than you, Libby.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.310
"He'll rob, cheat, run away."

06:19.320 --> 06:21.950
In fairness, Carl,
he has got previous.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.150
Don't make it right, does it?

06:23.160 --> 06:24.790
It's her I feel sorry for.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.870
Women plan their weddings when
they're little girls.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.790
To wait until you're her age,
until you're nearly a coffin-dodger

06:31.800 --> 06:33.590
only to have it snatched away.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.230
Ah well, fuck all to be done.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.830
We could put it on for 'em.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.190
The wedding.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.790
We could organise it to say sorry.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.070
No.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.070
We could organise it for them.

06:45.080 --> 06:49.070
I'll spread the word.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.110
Ah, all dressed up
and nowhere to go.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.110
What a shame.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.430
How did you get my number?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.470
There's not much gets in my way
when there's something I want.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.630
That do it for him, does it, Frank?

07:16.640 --> 07:17.710
The slutty librarian look?

07:17.720 --> 07:21.150
It's not a look.
I am a slutty librarian.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.950
Except for the slutty bit.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.590
You've got...

07:24.600 --> 07:28.550
You and your cripple mother
are occupying my marital home,

07:28.560 --> 07:31.630
and I would very much appreciate
it if you would vacate...

07:31.640 --> 07:35.630
I don't mean to be cruel, but Frank
divorced you, it's time to move on.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.950
It's just all there...

07:37.960 --> 07:40.830
When one is divorced, in absentia,
one can contest it,

07:40.840 --> 07:43.670
which I have done,
and the original petitioner

07:43.680 --> 07:47.670
has 28 days in which to challenge
my challenge, which Frank hasn't.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.070
He's in hospital.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.990
How's poor little me
to know that?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.430
Frank's 28 days run out tomorrow,

07:53.440 --> 07:57.190
so make sure you hand
the keys over by five.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.870
You've got a house.
You don't need ours.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.870
I know, but it's not
so much about me having it...

08:04.920 --> 08:07.590
it's more about you...
not having it.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.590
This has nothing to do with
the house, or Liam, or Stella.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.590
This is about Frank.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.590
As if.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.630
Watch yourself, Monica.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.630
Nothing much gets in my way either.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.270
This is my first erection
since 1987.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.390
Mimi?

08:47.400 --> 08:51.390
Upstairs.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.510
Mimi?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.510
I'm in the...

08:58.520 --> 09:01.390
I need your help.
I have to see Frank.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.870
Monica's trying
to nullify the divorce.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.950
Bitch.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.950
Would it be all right
if I wipe my arse first?

09:17.360 --> 09:21.350
So, he went off with the other
g-girl, and I never saw him again.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.230
Is that why you tried to kill
yourself, Carly?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.750
You were ashamed?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.750
I'm n-not ashamed.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.670
Can you understand how it felt
for your parents to have

09:33.680 --> 09:37.670
a daughter who behaved like...
well, like a slut?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.910
I d-didn't do what they said.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.910
Slut isn't my word,
but it's the word others might use.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.790
Something to add, Mr Gallagher?

09:48.800 --> 09:51.910
No, nothing, fuck you very much.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.910
Perhaps the group can
learn from your situation.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.230
Well, I'm always happy to oblige,
you know, for the sake of the group.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.110
OK, go ahead... Mildred.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.670
Why do you think you're here, Frank?

10:18.160 --> 10:22.150
Well, I'm here because I fight,
fuck,

10:23.640 --> 10:27.630
imbibe to excess every day in life,
regular as religion,

10:29.440 --> 10:33.430
and that scares the living shit
out of dusty-cunted control freaks

10:35.880 --> 10:38.910
such as your good self.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.470
That close enough?

10:40.480 --> 10:44.470
LAUGHTER

10:52.100 --> 10:55.090
Point is, we are a community,
and one of us needs some help.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.890
We've got 24 hours to pull
together a wedding,

10:57.900 --> 11:01.890
and everyone is going
to play their part.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.890
I could...

11:05.900 --> 11:09.890
I'm fine. Thanks.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.450
No, no - just try and keep up,
will you?

11:13.460 --> 11:17.450
Superman, Spider-Man,
Wizard of Oz - fictional.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.810
Barbara Windsor - real.

11:19.820 --> 11:23.810
'Mr Gallagher to Reception.'

11:24.500 --> 11:28.490
Two minutes.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.210
How did you...?

11:49.220 --> 11:50.690
I'm not allowed visitors.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.330
I gave him chocolate.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.250
Is that a euphemism?

11:54.260 --> 11:55.490
You let him...

11:55.500 --> 11:56.650
up the shitter?

11:56.660 --> 12:00.050
No, God, no. Real chocolate.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.130
Mimi knows everyone,

12:01.140 --> 12:04.730
put out feelers. Turns out the head
of security's a big fat fella,

12:04.740 --> 12:08.610
do anything for a couple
of airport-sized Toblerones.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.890
I thought you'd got cold feet.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.895
Well, I had, in a manner of speaking.
Not just me feet...

12:12.896 --> 12:14.890
the fuckers took every
thread of clothing I had.

12:16.540 --> 12:19.490
I feel so ashamed.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.490
I believed everything they said...
that clip on the web.

12:24.460 --> 12:27.930
Well, to be honest, I...I'd
seriously considered shagging her,

12:27.940 --> 12:29.130
just...just for the warmth.

12:29.140 --> 12:32.090
But I couldn't. I just couldn't.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.810
Because of you, Libby.

12:34.820 --> 12:38.690
I bought the new kitchen
and joined in,

12:38.700 --> 12:41.850
casting stones when no sin
had been committed.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.890
Can you ever forgive me?

12:43.900 --> 12:44.850
Frank?

12:44.860 --> 12:46.050
Er, what?

12:46.060 --> 12:49.010
Sorry. Er, sorry - I just...

12:49.020 --> 12:49.730
Midnight Express for a minute there.

12:49.740 --> 12:52.130
Monica's trying to sabotage
our happiness.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.610
We won't let her!

12:53.620 --> 12:56.810
We've only got 24 hours,
or your divorce is annulled.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.050
I'm getting out. For you.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.770
I'll wed you, Libby Croker.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.170
I love the bones of you,
Frank Gallagher.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.210
And I love... Did you say
we've got a new kitchen?

13:07.220 --> 13:07.970
Yes.

13:07.980 --> 13:08.530
Yes.
Time.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.250
Well, I hope we didn't stump for it.

13:11.260 --> 13:14.810
One of the very few advantages
of local authority housing, that is.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.250
That's what council tax is for.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.490
Did you get the receipt?

13:18.500 --> 13:22.490
I am coming home, Libby. Mark me.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.690
Veil and all. It's needed.

13:33.700 --> 13:34.810
I need netting, Lillian.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.610
Fine, coloured netting - yellow,
pale blue, salmon pink. And ribbon.

13:38.620 --> 13:41.810
It's a bastard getting haberdashery
on short notice round here.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.730
I might need mine.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.490
Wedding favours.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.970
Bomboniere in lace and ribbon,
maybe a whisky-fudge filling.

13:47.980 --> 13:51.970
They go for five quid
each in the shops, easy.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.050
What? Just cos I'm a bloke,

13:55.060 --> 13:57.450
I'm not allowed to appreciate
a bit of decorative embroidery?

13:57.460 --> 14:00.050
Dresser on't landing,
left-hand cupboard.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.650
Just take what you need.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.410
You're not doing
Malcolm Talcum in there, are you?

14:04.420 --> 14:07.250
Do I look like I work without a harness?

14:07.260 --> 14:08.810
I'm baking the cake for Frank
and Libby.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.130
You?!

14:10.140 --> 14:14.130
Yes. There is more to me than remarkably
strong pelvic floor muscles, you know.

14:15.140 --> 14:18.730
We're out of flour.

14:18.740 --> 14:22.730
And this young lady wants
to work with children

14:23.220 --> 14:27.210
and bring about world peace.
This one is kind to animals.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.530
Overly affectionate, if you ask me.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.410
Can't hear you. >

14:33.420 --> 14:37.410
(STUTTERS) He's just a deaf
and dumb Indian.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.250
Oh, is that right, chief, eh?

14:39.260 --> 14:41.610
You can't make a sound?

14:41.620 --> 14:45.610
(MOUTHS) Eh? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

14:47.420 --> 14:48.330
Yeah, hey, hey!

14:48.340 --> 14:52.330
He likes to(STUTTERS) burn stuff.

14:52.820 --> 14:56.010
What's with the
P-P-P-Porky Pig routine?

14:56.020 --> 14:59.050
You're not what's become
of Gareth Gates, are you?

14:59.060 --> 15:01.410
You've been here three weeks.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.770
I always... (STUTTERS) ..stutter.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.010
Yes, well, I've been mashed off me
fucking tits.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.730
I couldn't have counted me
own testicles,

15:07.740 --> 15:11.290
let alone told you the therapeutic
speech needs of my room-mates.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.050
So how come you're not mashed?

15:14.060 --> 15:17.330
Because...

15:17.340 --> 15:21.330
I've been doing
this for the last 48 hours.

15:22.060 --> 15:25.170
Spit, don't swallow.

15:25.180 --> 15:29.170
Something me first wife lived by,
more's the pity.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.810
Believe me, it goes
against the grain.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.330
Outside, I'm an outspoken
advocate for pharmacology

15:38.340 --> 15:40.650
and all its liberating qualities,
but in here,

15:40.660 --> 15:42.250
they use it to keep you down.

15:42.260 --> 15:46.250
And if I'm breaking out, kid...
Need a clear head, know what I mean?

15:47.540 --> 15:51.530
Your flies are undone, chief.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.010
Oi!

16:01.020 --> 16:01.970
Feel free to roll
your tongue back in.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.410
I would if she stopped hanging
her fanny in my face.

16:04.420 --> 16:08.410
Besides, it's bad luck for a muff to be
wearing a wedding dress that's not hers.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.610
Don't call her a muff. Besides, we don't
do superstitions. We're Catholics.

16:12.620 --> 16:13.730
So was Jesus.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.570
Didn't stop those
fuckers crucifying him.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.130
Jesus was a Catholic?
Killed by Muslims?

16:18.140 --> 16:22.130
No religious disputes
till after the ceremony.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.690
I need your oven. Ours is too small.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.610
Sorry.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.450
Is this OK?

16:37.460 --> 16:39.330
Yeah.

16:39.340 --> 16:42.090
No, it's fine.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.210
You look like a hooker.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.290
Thank you, Mum.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.890
A desperate, middle-aged one.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.890
I understand couples growing
apart, seven-year itch.

16:51.340 --> 16:55.210
I've even heard of women
who so repulse their men,

16:55.220 --> 16:57.410
the poor fellas turn
to homosexuality!

16:57.420 --> 17:00.330
But to drive a man insane,

17:00.340 --> 17:04.329
to push him over the edge of reason,
that's quite a talent.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.010
What are you doing?

17:07.020 --> 17:11.010
Excuse me - I'm having a
conversation with my own daughter. >

17:13.660 --> 17:14.690
Have you seen it out there?

17:14.700 --> 17:18.690
That lot could put on the Olympics
for ten bob and two milk bottle-tops.

17:19.060 --> 17:21.050
Seb Coe'll be crying
into his Pimm's.

17:21.060 --> 17:24.849
I'm really touched, Mimi.

17:24.859 --> 17:25.970
Frank would be, too.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.970
There's not one woman on the estate
would've done any different, you know.

17:30.140 --> 17:34.130
I let him down, Mimi.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.210
You misjudged your fella.
It's not a fucking crime.

17:38.220 --> 17:41.210
Especially considering
his previous record.

17:41.220 --> 17:45.210
It's all for nothing, all those
good people out there. This.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.970
Who am I kidding?
There won't be any wedding.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.730
Monica wins, we lose.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.090
That's bollocks.

17:55.180 --> 17:59.170
They're never going to let him out.
I don't deserve him after what I've done,

18:00.460 --> 18:04.450
and she's pulling the strings,
like the puppet-master!

18:05.140 --> 18:08.250
Ow!

18:08.260 --> 18:10.650
I'm going to tell you
something my mother told me,

18:10.660 --> 18:14.250
and it's always stuck.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.250
Stop moaning and feeling sorry for
yourself, you whiny little bitch!

18:18.500 --> 18:22.290
If he matters to you so much,
then get off up your arse

18:22.300 --> 18:26.290
and go and fetch him.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.490
And it's not just me.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.850
Taking over the asylum, are we?

18:50.860 --> 18:51.930
Good for you, kid.

18:51.940 --> 18:55.650
Now, if it's all the same,
I've got a lot on me mind.

18:55.660 --> 18:59.650
But I thought we were
g...g...g...getting out.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.570
Yeah, well, easy said.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.770
Or not, in your case.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.770
We've got a map. Taber.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.730
It's...tattooed across his back.

19:11.740 --> 19:15.730
Fucking knew Prison Break
was realistic.

19:18.020 --> 19:20.690
Tomorrow morning, after meds.

19:20.700 --> 19:24.690
The orderlies go to brekkie.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.090
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:46.100 --> 19:48.890
Come in.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.010
It's Liam.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.810
He says if I'm best man
I'm supposed to do a speech.

19:51.820 --> 19:54.090
That's right.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.970
I don't do speeches.

19:55.980 --> 19:59.290
I'm the strong, silent one.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.290
You're a shit-stirring
little fucker.

20:10.740 --> 20:14.370
Dunno how you can stand it here
after all he did to you.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.090
The place makes me want to take
a nail-brush to my skin.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.610
Mm.

20:18.620 --> 20:21.730
Sometimes think they should put
serotonin in the water supply

20:21.740 --> 20:24.050
for these places, do us all
a favour.

20:24.060 --> 20:26.610
Hm.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.370
Still...

20:28.380 --> 20:30.370
Another 24 hours
and we're done, eh?

20:30.380 --> 20:32.250
Mm.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.890
I do love you, Mon.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.210
Don't know what I'd do without you.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.650
What?

20:39.660 --> 20:41.050
Oh, yeah.

20:41.060 --> 20:45.050
I know.

20:45.140 --> 20:49.050
Could I have a napkin, please?

20:49.060 --> 20:53.050
HORN BLASTS

21:06.420 --> 21:09.330
Fucking hell - I can't look at that.

21:09.340 --> 21:12.730
I can't fucking get any more, mate,
I tell ya.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.170
Go on. Pop 'em in the bag.

21:14.180 --> 21:18.170
They'll be put to good
use on the outside.

21:19.300 --> 21:22.850
Here you are, chief - something to
remember me by when I'm famous.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.690
(SHOUTS)

21:25.700 --> 21:27.330
You can't m-m-m-make me!

21:27.340 --> 21:30.610
I think I can.
These are prescribed for you.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.930
Hey!

21:31.940 --> 21:33.090
Is this your doing?

21:33.100 --> 21:33.930
What?

21:33.940 --> 21:35.850
Carly hasn't taken her
meds in nearly 24 hours.

21:35.860 --> 21:36.890
It's no wonder
she's feeling anxious.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.010
Well, ramming them down
her throat with a clenched fist

21:39.020 --> 21:39.770
ain't going to calm
her down any, is it?

21:39.780 --> 21:41.850
You're a medical practitioner now,
are you?

21:41.860 --> 21:43.690
Something else to add
to your many talents.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.850
I'm just...

21:44.860 --> 21:45.770
Just... That is not necessary.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.770
Take your hands off me!

21:48.780 --> 21:51.050
All right! Don't... Fucking ease up.

21:51.060 --> 21:55.050
Come on, then. I'm just trying
to fucking help. Fucking hell!

22:13.860 --> 22:17.850
BANG

22:38.700 --> 22:41.610
BAGPIPES BLAST

22:41.620 --> 22:42.010
BABY CRIES

22:42.020 --> 22:43.570
We're all right.

22:43.580 --> 22:45.610
She slept from ten-to
till twenty-past.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.090
Carl kept us company.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.890
Oh...

22:48.900 --> 22:52.890
Right, this is what I've got.

22:54.220 --> 22:58.210
"Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf
of the bride and groom..."

22:59.100 --> 23:00.130
That's took me all night.

23:00.140 --> 23:04.130
If I wanted to do fucking speeches,
I would've stuck in at school!

23:05.460 --> 23:09.450
We are fucked.

23:11.420 --> 23:13.770
Please.

23:13.780 --> 23:17.770
Can you help us?

23:30.860 --> 23:32.450
(SCREAMS)

23:32.460 --> 23:36.450
Oh...

23:37.500 --> 23:41.490
And up.

23:42.580 --> 23:46.570
And relax.

23:47.580 --> 23:51.570
And stretch again.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.970
All right, Mr Gallagher?

24:05.140 --> 24:08.010
The group were in the middle
of exercise.

24:08.020 --> 24:10.690
Pardon me, I just...

24:10.700 --> 24:14.690
I'm supposed to have my
anti-psychotics now.

24:17.580 --> 24:21.570
Wait there, please.

24:32.420 --> 24:36.130
Open the door!

24:36.140 --> 24:36.890
How...?!

24:36.900 --> 24:38.090
I've got tolerance, haven't I?

24:38.100 --> 24:42.090
That's how we used to get our kicks
when the kitty was empty - jump leads.

24:42.260 --> 24:43.490
We'd better g...g...

24:43.500 --> 24:47.490
Yeah, yeah. They'll be here by the
time you've said it. Come on. Come on!

24:48.100 --> 24:49.610
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Lovely. Love...

24:49.620 --> 24:53.010
Let me out.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.330
You?

24:54.340 --> 24:58.330
And her? And you?

25:02.180 --> 25:06.170
Let me ou-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-ut!

25:06.300 --> 25:10.290
Frank. Come on.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.970
We've got the fucking keys,
Sitting Bull.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.810
Come on.

25:17.820 --> 25:21.810
Frank!

25:24.020 --> 25:25.810
Let me out!

25:25.820 --> 25:27.090
Come on!

25:27.100 --> 25:31.090
Let me ou-u-u-u-u-u-u-ut!

25:34.600 --> 25:35.630
Lillian?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.310
What the fuck is that?

25:37.320 --> 25:39.870
I've improvised.
Inspired by Versace.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.510
No wonder he got fucking shot.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.470
Haute cuisine!

25:43.480 --> 25:47.470
It looks like you've sneezed
a lucky bag onto a doily.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.830
Right, love, let's have you.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.990
Jamie.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.990
Yes, mate.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.710
CELTIC FOLK MUSIC PLAYS

26:11.280 --> 26:15.270
Like a pig in fucking clogs!

26:16.280 --> 26:20.270
It won't bind. I can't make the cake
fucking bind.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.390
Come on, you were doing so well.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.110
This is the only layer
I can get to bind.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.590
HEAVY THUD

26:29.600 --> 26:32.950
Fancy a bite?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.670
Oh, easy, they're delicate, these.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.030
Oh, shut the fuck up!

26:36.040 --> 26:40.030
You're such a woman these days, I'm
surprised you're not breast feeding.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.590
I thought you were home?

26:43.600 --> 26:45.470
I've been in there
gone an hour.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.310
Ate one of his flipping curries.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.870
Nowt wrong with the cooking.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.150
Maybe it's got something
to do with the vodka ices

26:51.160 --> 26:52.950
she was sneaking in all night.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.950
Hold on, what's this about you
drinking vodka ices?

26:55.960 --> 26:58.110
For fuck's sake, what's wrong
with you? Eat it!

26:58.120 --> 27:02.070
ROWDY CHATTER

27:02.080 --> 27:03.390
What's this?

27:03.400 --> 27:07.390
Wedding by chaos theory?

27:09.200 --> 27:13.190
BELL RINGS

27:14.080 --> 27:16.110
Right, everyone!

27:16.120 --> 27:20.110
I think it's time we got organised.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.270
Right, look, look!

27:26.280 --> 27:30.230
It's very nice, you know,
very flattering...

27:30.240 --> 27:32.390
but it's like
Shaun of the fucking Dead.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.070
I'm very proud to be
captain of the Merry Pranksters,

27:35.080 --> 27:39.070
but you're hardly inconspicuous,
are you?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.790
You'll get me huckled.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.190
(GROANS)

27:43.200 --> 27:45.390
You'll be all right, go on.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.870
Go on.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.870
Go on, cowboy.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.790
Cheer up, Charlie.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.310
It's C...

27:57.320 --> 28:01.310
Carly, yeah I know,
it's just an expression.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.430
Frank!

28:08.640 --> 28:12.110
You'll be all right, love.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.470
Just don't...

28:13.480 --> 28:16.670
give yourself away for nothing.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.390
I want lads to like me.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.590
Sweetheart, any lad who likes you
because you ride him

28:21.600 --> 28:24.110
behind the pavilion is hardly
likely to have your

28:24.120 --> 28:28.110
long-term interests at heart, OK?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.590
Can I visit you?

28:29.600 --> 28:33.150
Yeah, course you can.

28:33.160 --> 28:37.150
I've a son at home who'd be lucky
to know a lass like you.

28:37.600 --> 28:41.350
He'll try and shag you before you
get your coat off, mind,

28:41.360 --> 28:45.350
but make him wait,
make him appreciate you.

29:03.160 --> 29:07.150
Come on!

29:10.560 --> 29:14.550
Fuckin' hell, help us out, will ya?

29:17.600 --> 29:21.590
Oi!

29:28.360 --> 29:32.350
Thank you.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.390
Gallagher, Francis.
Must be sedated.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.390
Come on.

29:53.720 --> 29:57.430
I gathered opinion.
It seems you might have a point.

29:57.440 --> 30:01.430
If I had to get married in that,
I'd throw myself in front of a tram.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.710
Which would be a slow
death in Manchester.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.470
Where does that leave us?

30:04.480 --> 30:07.830
She could use the old dress
I married in.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.070
Ancient, but me mother,
grandmother,

30:11.080 --> 30:15.070
and great grandmother
wore it before me.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.310
Half of the battle is knowing
when you're beat.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.190
Truth is, I can barely toast bread.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.670
A case of ambition
exceeding ability.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.670
So, what's this?

30:27.680 --> 30:29.150
Where there's a will, Karen.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.590
I'm gonna make my contribution
to Libby personally.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.590
Something more in line with my area
of expertise.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.470
Liam's gonna email a speech over.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.470
You can download them
off the internet. You got a printer?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.630
I love it when a plan
comes together.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.630
Coming together...
now there's a thought.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.070
CHEERING

31:20.120 --> 31:21.430
Libby!

31:21.440 --> 31:24.590
You look beautiful.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.470
I'm so proud of you.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.470
Oh, Mum. I always knew
it would be like this.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.710
Thank you so much.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.030
Hang on a minute.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.310
You can't walk.

31:41.320 --> 31:44.710
It's all too perfect, innit?

31:44.720 --> 31:48.430
Of course it's a dream.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.670
Perfect things don't happen to you,
Libby.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.670
LAUGHTER ECHOES

32:00.960 --> 32:03.390
My God!

32:03.400 --> 32:05.190
LOUD BANG

32:05.200 --> 32:09.190
SCREAMING

32:29.240 --> 32:33.230
CARIBBEAN STEEL DRUM MUSIC PLAYS

32:33.360 --> 32:37.350
I think it's better
than a wedding cake.

32:37.440 --> 32:41.430
Slaved over a hot stove for these.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.510
Second time lucky.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.590
It's all good.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.590
Very good.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.430
Good choice.

32:50.440 --> 32:54.430
Someone's coming.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.990
TAPE OF BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS

33:04.000 --> 33:07.270
Thought you might need one of these.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.230
I had a funeral.

33:08.240 --> 33:12.230
Well, they won't
be going anywhere then, will they?

33:14.840 --> 33:18.510
BAGPIPE TAPE PLAYS AGAIN

33:18.520 --> 33:19.830
I made it. I made it!

33:19.840 --> 33:20.910
Thank fuck for that.

33:20.920 --> 33:24.910
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:32.520 --> 33:35.750
Right, so where is she?

33:35.760 --> 33:39.310
Oh, Libby?

33:39.320 --> 33:40.830
Thought she was with you.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.950
TAPE STOPS

33:43.960 --> 33:47.270
She's probably just being
fashionably late.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.670
What's this? Spirit of the Blitz?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.230
What have you done with her?

33:51.240 --> 33:53.470
Who, the geek?

33:53.480 --> 33:54.910
I'm surprised you're not relieved
she hasn't showed.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.870
I'm fuckin' warning you, Monica.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.550
I haven't done anything.

33:58.560 --> 34:02.510
If she's not here, then,
she must've found sense.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.590
One thing I will
say for Chatsworth,

34:05.600 --> 34:08.949
you do know how to party.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.949
Did you miss me?

34:14.659 --> 34:18.650
Any word?

34:18.820 --> 34:19.889
Where is she?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.610
I'm not her keeper.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.370
Oh, but you know something.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.570
Tell him.

34:27.580 --> 34:31.570
Or I'll take Boyzone
off the jukebox.

34:33.219 --> 34:34.650
She left before dawn.

34:34.659 --> 34:38.570
She might have said something
about going to the nuthouse

34:38.580 --> 34:39.610
to fetch you out.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.409
Oh, fuck!

34:41.420 --> 34:44.090
Her phone's ringing.

34:44.100 --> 34:44.889
Libby?

34:44.900 --> 34:47.090
Libby. Is that...?

34:47.100 --> 34:50.250
Hello! Hello!

34:50.260 --> 34:52.850
Fuck!

34:52.860 --> 34:54.370
Do you think we should...?

34:54.380 --> 34:56.010
Yeah, probably.

34:56.020 --> 35:00.010
Frank!

35:11.340 --> 35:15.330
(BABY CRIES)

35:18.780 --> 35:21.690
(BABY CRIES)

35:21.700 --> 35:24.290
Did Peck and Niven have to
contend with crying infants

35:24.300 --> 35:26.210
when they stormed
the Guns of Navarone?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.050
I couldn't leave her
in the pub, could I?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.890
It would've been irresponsible.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.410
EXPLOSION

35:32.420 --> 35:36.410
Right, What's the plan?

35:37.100 --> 35:40.410
Shane and Ches - up the rear,
coming in a pincer movement,

35:40.420 --> 35:42.210
with Jamie and Carl in the corridor.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.010
I'm going to parascend down
through the sky-light.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.010
How the fuck do I know what the plan
is? Do I look like I was in 'Nam?

35:48.020 --> 35:49.250
Well, you could've been.

35:49.260 --> 35:49.970
Altrincham, maybe.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.210
Fucking Chippenham.

35:51.220 --> 35:51.970
Nottingham.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.610
Cheltenham.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.290
Didsbury.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.970
EXPLOSION

35:57.980 --> 36:00.330
I'll leave the intrigue
to you lot in the cheap seats.

36:00.340 --> 36:03.410
I'm going to get Libby.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.130
He's like Scott of the Antarctic
or summat.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.930
It'll be the drugs he's on,
still affecting him.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.930
It must be. He's completely
forgotten he's an arsehole.

36:09.940 --> 36:13.930
Debenhams!

36:28.140 --> 36:30.810
Oh, you're just looking after that
for them, are you?

36:30.820 --> 36:31.810
That why you're only
taking the cash?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.450
That why you're only taking the cash?
How dare you?

36:33.460 --> 36:34.610
Security will be...

36:34.620 --> 36:37.170
Oh, shut up! You're not
dealing with fucking...

36:37.180 --> 36:38.570
Don't work on grown-ups, love.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.130
You can't have her, you know.

36:40.140 --> 36:43.610
Monica's moved on. She's
with me now. She's happy.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.610
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can see that(!)

36:45.620 --> 36:48.730
That's why she's hanging
round my home, my pub,

36:48.740 --> 36:49.810
why she's trying to stop Libby
and me getting hitched.

36:49.820 --> 36:51.570
She doesn't care about that.

36:51.580 --> 36:53.210
She's only bothered about her kids.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.890
Can't stand the thought of them
being neglected.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.930
Oh, really?

36:55.940 --> 36:59.610
And what kids is that then, Mildred?

36:59.620 --> 37:01.050
Liam and Stella.

37:01.060 --> 37:01.890
And the others?

37:01.900 --> 37:03.450
What others?

37:03.460 --> 37:06.090
The other five.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.690
Oh, yeah. Total of seven.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.570
The one that's in there now
must have to brace itself

37:11.580 --> 37:15.570
against the sides
when she's taking a dump!

37:20.980 --> 37:23.090
You stupid cow.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.930
She's going to ditch you and run,

37:24.940 --> 37:27.610
same as she's done with
everyone else in her life.

37:27.620 --> 37:31.610
Men like you should be locked up.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.490
Oh...

37:37.060 --> 37:39.730
Might as well be hung
for a sheep as a lamb.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.130
Eh!

37:41.140 --> 37:42.650
Where is she, chief?

37:42.660 --> 37:44.610
Come on, tell me
and I'm out of here.

37:44.620 --> 37:48.610
And the world's your lobster.

37:49.020 --> 37:51.010
When the fire alarm went off,
they all bolted,

37:51.020 --> 37:54.210
left her in the treatment room.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.330
Bzzzzzz!

37:56.340 --> 38:00.330
She stumbled out ten minutes later,
all electrodes and stuff still on.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.130
Phone.

38:03.140 --> 38:07.130
Come on.

38:09.380 --> 38:13.370
Ah. Knock yourself out.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.570
You're taking the piss!

38:15.580 --> 38:17.410
Frank!

38:17.420 --> 38:18.770
Come on.

38:18.780 --> 38:19.450
Libby's at The Jockey.

38:19.460 --> 38:20.650
What?

38:20.660 --> 38:22.370
There's still time.

38:22.380 --> 38:25.010
Have we got time for a pint?
It's been a while.

38:25.020 --> 38:29.010
Move.

38:34.740 --> 38:38.730
(SOBBING)

38:40.060 --> 38:41.090
Frank!

38:41.100 --> 38:42.530
Frank, listen!

38:42.540 --> 38:44.410
Look, maybe it isn't about the kids.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.970
Maybe Esmerelda here
isn't entirely wrong.

38:46.980 --> 38:48.090
About what?

38:48.100 --> 38:50.250
We've been through
a lot together, eh?

38:50.260 --> 38:52.010
A whole lifetime together.

38:52.020 --> 38:53.250
Oh...

38:53.260 --> 38:55.090
No, it's only the finality
of the divorce.

38:55.100 --> 38:59.090
It's made me realise
that I still want to be...

38:59.300 --> 39:02.010
No, I need to be...

39:02.020 --> 39:03.050
Monica Gallagher.

39:03.060 --> 39:06.130
She had you sectioned!

39:06.140 --> 39:08.650
Yeah, only because
I wanted to keep you.

39:08.660 --> 39:12.650
It was always you, Frank.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.410
Yeah, well, it was Norma
for a while.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.970
Yeah, but...

39:16.980 --> 39:20.370
Then Nurse fucking Lobotomy
in there, Ian's dad,

39:20.380 --> 39:23.810
the hypnotist,
the bloke from the dole,

39:23.820 --> 39:26.810
the mechanic when we wanted
a spark plug that time.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.970
Yeah, I know.

39:27.980 --> 39:31.970
I've made mistakes - we both have.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.970
But I'm back.

39:40.980 --> 39:43.690
I'll always come back.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.650
The others don't matter.

39:46.660 --> 39:49.530
I know now.

39:49.540 --> 39:53.330
You're the one.

39:53.340 --> 39:57.330
Yeah...

40:01.100 --> 40:05.090
..but you're not.

40:06.740 --> 40:10.730
She is.

40:21.140 --> 40:22.290
Fuck's going on?

40:22.300 --> 40:24.130
I knew you'd come.

40:24.140 --> 40:25.370
Wait!

40:25.380 --> 40:27.370
Wait a minute.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.570
Fuck's sake, Carl. What?

40:28.580 --> 40:30.490
Dad...

40:30.500 --> 40:32.250
You don't need your speech, Carl.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.730
They're not getting married.
We had to let the priest go.

40:34.740 --> 40:35.450
Oh...

40:35.460 --> 40:36.730
It's not my speech.

40:36.740 --> 40:40.610
It's from Liam.

40:40.620 --> 40:43.170
"Carl, if you're reading
this out loud,

40:43.180 --> 40:46.850
"it means you haven't looked
at the speech I've sent you

40:46.860 --> 40:48.930
"till the last possible moment,

40:48.940 --> 40:52.450
"and so are completely unaware
that this is a letter from me...

40:52.460 --> 40:53.650
"and not a speech."

40:53.660 --> 40:56.250
LAUGHTER

40:56.260 --> 40:59.370
Twat. I'll, erm.. I'll skip.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.570
"Dad, I know what you must think,

41:01.580 --> 41:04.210
"but I didn't betray you
on that stag night.

41:04.220 --> 41:08.170
"Mum did, so she could
have you locked up,

41:08.180 --> 41:09.770
"grab hold of me and Stella,

41:09.780 --> 41:12.770
"and use us to get
a decent house off the council."

41:12.780 --> 41:14.250
You fucking what?

41:14.260 --> 41:18.010
Well, have you any idea how long
the list is for a single woman?

41:18.020 --> 41:22.010
I'm with child.

41:22.420 --> 41:23.450
Wow.

41:23.460 --> 41:26.130
"But don't blame Mum.
Don't hate her.

41:26.140 --> 41:29.970
"Life didn't deliver what Mum hoped,

41:29.980 --> 41:33.490
"and she's found that
harder than most.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.930
"It's damaged her.

41:34.940 --> 41:38.930
"But she's my mum...

41:40.980 --> 41:44.970
"..and that's why
I'm going to stay with her.

41:50.260 --> 41:54.250
"I'm going to fix her, if I can.

41:56.140 --> 42:00.130
"Cos if I can love her,
then maybe she can love herself.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.650
"So Carl, you twat,

42:06.660 --> 42:10.650
"don't come after me.

42:11.980 --> 42:15.290
"It's where I want to be.

42:15.300 --> 42:19.290
"Love you. Good night
and good luck, Liam"

42:20.580 --> 42:23.130
Can't half drone on,
that Liam, eh?

42:23.140 --> 42:27.130
Thought he'd never shut up.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.330
You did good.

42:41.340 --> 42:44.010
Hear, hear.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.770
Shame they couldn't actually get
wed after all that, though, innit?

42:45.780 --> 42:48.730
Kinda sweet, though.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.730
Do you think they're kinky-weird
or just...weird?

42:54.460 --> 42:55.570
Do you fancy...

42:55.580 --> 42:56.610
Yeah, I do.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.210
And I have done all day,
desperately.

42:59.220 --> 43:03.210
So much so that...I had to
tape my stiffy to me belly.

43:04.940 --> 43:08.930
I was going to say "pakora."

43:09.900 --> 43:12.290
But if you want to
come back to my bed...

43:12.300 --> 43:13.730
I do.

43:13.740 --> 43:17.730
Our bed.

43:17.820 --> 43:19.450
Now.

43:19.460 --> 43:23.450
I want you now.

43:26.340 --> 43:28.010
Is it how you imagined it?

43:28.020 --> 43:29.730
No.

43:29.740 --> 43:32.730
Not remotely. Not even a little bit.

43:32.740 --> 43:36.730
But...what they've done, for us,

43:37.740 --> 43:38.770
it's incredible.

43:38.780 --> 43:40.170
Yeah, you're right.

43:40.180 --> 43:44.170
Cos usually, they're...

43:44.940 --> 43:48.930
..cunts, and I wouldn't mourn
any one of them,

43:51.380 --> 43:54.690
but, you know,
this past couple of days...

43:54.700 --> 43:58.530
Yeah, they're all right.

43:58.540 --> 44:01.370
We're soulmates, Frank.

44:01.380 --> 44:02.970
Yeah.

44:02.980 --> 44:06.370
We are. It's great and all that,
but...

44:06.380 --> 44:10.370
About this kitchen - what the fuck
was wrong with the old one?

44:12.420 --> 44:16.410
GNARLS BARKLEY: Crazy

44:31.580 --> 44:35.570
'Freedom isn't quantifiable -
you can't measure it.

44:36.740 --> 44:40.450
'It's a feeling you either have
or you don't.

44:40.460 --> 44:44.450
'One man's straitjacket is another
man's keys to the kingdom.'

44:47.820 --> 44:49.970
Got another job lined up
for tomorrow if you're interested.

44:49.980 --> 44:51.530
Working for the family now.

44:51.540 --> 44:52.570
It's Carl's 21st.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.290
We need to mark it.

44:54.300 --> 44:55.690
You need to give it to
a guy called Kermit.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.730
You must be Carl.

44:56.740 --> 44:57.570
Carl Gallagher.

44:57.580 --> 44:59.090
This is two-grand light!

44:59.100 --> 45:00.770
He hasn't been home.

45:00.780 --> 45:01.890
Just been talking about your lot.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.530
All right, all right. Calm down, calm down.

45:05.540 --> 45:07.410
How have you managed to run up
a 500 phone bill?

45:07.420 --> 45:09.130
It's a gay sex line.

45:09.140 --> 45:12.210
Joe rented it out, got some lads to
man the phones - he raked it in.

45:12.220 --> 45:13.650
You want to stick it up my
virgin arse, don't you?

45:13.660 --> 45:17.650
No, I'm going to stick it on a cracker.

45:49.420 --> 45:53.410

Gallagher, you're barred.

46:17.860 --> 46:19.930
Fucking Scousers.

46:19.940 --> 46:23.810
I knew it!

46:23.820 --> 46:27.810
Ooohhh, me arse.
