02:36.797 --> 02:38.648
Assholes.

03:06.328 --> 03:08.430
- Hey, where've you been?
- Nowhere.

03:08.976 --> 03:09.976
Nowhere?

03:11.023 --> 03:12.805
- I went running.
- Bullshit.

03:12.822 --> 03:14.148
Am I talking to you?

03:14.414 --> 03:15.414
Hey, come here.

03:15.734 --> 03:17.001
Empty your pockets.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.289
Ma, come on.

03:27.234 --> 03:28.701
Can I go now, officer?

03:28.836 --> 03:29.984
Check his socks.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.469
Fuck off!
No one's talking to you.

03:32.486 --> 03:34.693
Hey. Don't talk to your brother like that.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.554
Hand them over.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.752
What did I tell you about this, huh?

03:45.227 --> 03:46.227
Go get ready.

03:49.992 --> 03:51.722
I didn't know you could read.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.929
You're the one in summer school, dumbass.

04:40.148 --> 04:42.718
- Hey, yo, I'm in here.
- Yo, hurry up.

04:45.945 --> 04:48.479
- Are you jacking off in there?
- No!

04:49.250 --> 04:51.281
Got some tweezers out here,
if you're having trouble.

04:51.298 --> 04:54.321
Can I have some privacy please. Dude.

04:56.820 --> 05:00.054
Hey, look, we're leaving in five minutes.
I ain't waiting for you.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.343
Okay. Yep.

05:02.961 --> 05:05.094
Don't flush the toilet, alright?

05:05.111 --> 05:07.406
Hey, ahh, damn it.

05:09.844 --> 05:12.007
- Asshole!
- Five minutes!

05:31.344 --> 05:32.344
I'm coming.

05:44.641 --> 05:46.421
- Ma, the phone.
- Jack, come on.

05:46.438 --> 05:48.031
- Who is it?
- I dunno.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.515
Well, can you find out?

05:49.532 --> 05:50.930
Yo, come on.
I'm gonna be late.

05:51.172 --> 05:52.969
- Fine. Come on. Come on.
- Jack.

06:04.047 --> 06:06.758
<i>This is Karen, Tom and Jack.
Please leave a message.</i>

06:09.648 --> 06:11.811
<i>Hey, Karen, it's Grant.</i>

06:11.828 --> 06:13.492
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

06:15.202 --> 06:19.757
<i>Look, I hate to leave something like this on your machine,
so if you're there, please pick up.</i>

06:21.984 --> 06:24.918
<i>Your sister had another incident last night.</i>

06:25.617 --> 06:26.617
<i>She's fine.</i>

06:27.125 --> 06:29.508
<i>I mean, they say
it's not as bad as last time, but...</i>

06:29.525 --> 06:34.007
<i>I have to drive us back to the clinic tomorrow
and I don't have anybody to look after Ben.</i>

06:34.641 --> 06:39.187
<i>I was hoping that he could come
stay with you guys for just a couple of days.</i>

06:39.641 --> 06:40.641
<i>Look, I just...</i>

06:40.658 --> 06:42.742
<i>I just really can't take him with me.</i>

06:42.945 --> 06:46.545
<i>Could you give me a call back
as soon as you get this?</i>

06:59.648 --> 07:01.601
- You okay for a ride back?
- Yeah.

07:01.618 --> 07:04.250
Do you think you can spot me like five bucks,
maybe just for lunch.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.352
- Jesus Tom!
- I just... I got no cash.

07:10.852 --> 07:11.918
Hey, thanks mom.

07:14.258 --> 07:15.258
[???] in today?

07:15.930 --> 07:17.772
Yeah. [???] Monday.

07:17.789 --> 07:18.789
[???]

07:19.039 --> 07:21.039
Don't let him dick you around.

07:27.508 --> 07:30.227
...you see compounds that have two of the same,

07:30.244 --> 07:32.281
they're gonna be what?

07:32.298 --> 07:33.500
Pretty much non-polar.

07:33.517 --> 07:38.164
So you can have things
that have two nitrogens and whatnot.

07:38.531 --> 07:40.703
Okay, in a polar bond...

07:40.720 --> 07:42.703
It's not like an ionic bond
that we talked about

07:42.720 --> 07:45.813
where one of the elements
gives up an electron to the other one

07:45.830 --> 07:49.405
in order to satisfy
that valence ring of eight.

07:49.499 --> 07:53.062
They end up sharing still,
so they're covalent.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.109
Okay. But let's take fluorine...

07:57.126 --> 07:59.100
And who remembers...?
We went over...

07:59.117 --> 08:02.827
Fluorine is the most electronegative.

08:03.148 --> 08:04.984
And you need to remember that.

08:05.001 --> 08:07.687
Now, what we're gonna do later, not today...

08:07.704 --> 08:10.836
But there's numbers
on the periodic table that actually...

08:10.853 --> 08:15.320
Somebody's gone in and said-
Put a number to how electronegative this is.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.967
- Cya later.
- Bye.

08:43.820 --> 08:44.820
Hey, Robyn.

08:47.961 --> 08:48.961
Hey, Robyn.

08:49.375 --> 08:50.375
What's up?

08:50.516 --> 08:52.289
Could I talk to you for a sec?

08:52.306 --> 08:53.430
About?

08:53.945 --> 08:55.343
Just to talk?

08:55.383 --> 08:57.227
Nah, dude, I gotta get home.

08:57.259 --> 08:58.570
But text me.

08:58.905 --> 08:59.749
Alright, cool.

08:59.769 --> 09:01.902
Well, you're still having that party
tomorrow night, right?

09:01.919 --> 09:02.823
Yeah.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.066
Alright, well.
I guess I'll see you there then, yeah?

09:05.083 --> 09:07.410
- Yeah, alright.
- Alright, cool.

09:13.012 --> 09:15.214
What makes you think you're invited, Scab?

09:15.231 --> 09:17.199
It's a free house, ain't it?

09:18.371 --> 09:21.418
- Yeah, but no tiny dicks allowed.
- Shut up, Holly.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.441
What?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.672
We all saw the photo, Tiny Tim.

09:26.910 --> 09:27.910
Whatever.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.769
You've never even fucking seen one before.

09:29.786 --> 09:30.785
Have too.

09:30.802 --> 09:32.340
Your dad's don't count.

09:32.647 --> 09:34.902
Scab's got a tiny dick.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.942
- Scab's got a tiny dick.
- That's not my name.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.786
I said that's not my name.

09:39.122 --> 09:40.122
Yo, Jack.

09:41.426 --> 09:43.626
'The fuck you think you're going?

09:43.832 --> 09:44.863
Hey, Shane.

09:44.910 --> 09:45.910
Hey, Shane?

09:46.098 --> 09:48.004
What, are we fucking friends now,
or something?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.473
Go pick on someone else, dickhead.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.480
Yo, Harriet, shut the fuck up.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.848
This look familiar to you, huh?

09:56.395 --> 09:57.395
No?

09:58.379 --> 09:59.979
Oh, that's really funny.

10:00.098 --> 10:04.402
'Cause some asshole came to my dad's house
this morning and tagged my garage.

10:05.239 --> 10:06.905
You know what they wrote?

10:07.458 --> 10:08.458
No.

10:11.489 --> 10:12.489
Fuck off.

10:13.918 --> 10:16.411
- No ideas huh?
- Get the fuck off!

10:27.622 --> 10:30.215
Next time,
it's going in your fucking mouth.

10:30.232 --> 10:31.465
Got me?

10:34.622 --> 10:35.622
Cunt.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.418
Hey, Jack.

10:54.997 --> 10:55.997
Jack.

10:58.145 --> 10:59.145
Jack.

10:59.418 --> 11:00.418
Leave me alone.

11:01.372 --> 11:02.372
Are you okay?

11:02.991 --> 11:03.991
Fine.

11:05.257 --> 11:07.899
You know, you can come wash your face
at my house it's just right around the corner...

11:07.916 --> 11:09.312
Leave me alone.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.798
Fine.

11:15.751 --> 11:16.751
Be a dick.

13:13.922 --> 13:15.686
- Tom back yet?
- No.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
Anyone call?

13:20.959 --> 13:22.226
<i>Three new messages.</i>

13:23.043 --> 13:24.442
Can you turn that down?

13:25.612 --> 13:27.447
<i>Hey, Karen, it's Grant.</i>

13:27.745 --> 13:29.377
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

13:30.588 --> 13:35.182
<i>Look, I hate to leave something like this on your machine,
so if you're there, please pick up.</i>

13:35.667 --> 13:37.603
<i>Your sister had another incident last night.</i>

13:37.620 --> 13:38.733
Jack, turn that off.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.257
- Ma.
- Off.

13:46.487 --> 13:48.220
Ma. I was just about...

13:49.593 --> 13:50.860
No, I'm still here.

13:54.515 --> 13:56.981
No, no. It's fine.
Of course we can.

13:57.243 --> 13:58.243
Yeah.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.027
How's he taking it?

14:05.622 --> 14:07.355
Okay, when does he get in?

14:08.766 --> 14:10.217
Tomorrow, right? Okay.

14:10.889 --> 14:11.889
Fine.

14:12.978 --> 14:17.372
Yeah. Yeah, please. Just have her call me
when she's feeling more herself. Okay.

14:18.616 --> 14:20.150
Yeah. Have her call me.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.527
Okay.

14:23.141 --> 14:24.141
Bye.

14:28.297 --> 14:29.297
Who was that?

14:44.586 --> 14:45.586
Get off.

14:45.700 --> 14:46.966
What is that stuff?

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
Paint.

14:54.046 --> 14:55.855
Why can't Tom look after him?

14:55.872 --> 14:57.347
Tom's working.

14:58.584 --> 15:00.654
It's just a couple of days.
What is your problem?

15:00.671 --> 15:01.715
Nothing.

15:03.063 --> 15:04.196
He's your cousin.

15:04.213 --> 15:05.387
So?

15:05.862 --> 15:08.544
So? He's family. Look out for him.

15:08.714 --> 15:09.957
Tom's family.

15:10.804 --> 15:12.613
He ain't never looked after me.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.430
He'd be there when you needed him.

15:15.075 --> 15:16.075
Says you.

15:23.818 --> 15:24.818
This is it.

15:25.765 --> 15:27.229
Don't mention Aunt Sharon.

15:27.246 --> 15:28.929
Not unless he brings it up.

16:13.909 --> 16:15.043
How was the ride?

16:22.086 --> 16:24.753
Had to get up at the crack of dawn, huh?

16:29.098 --> 16:31.012
Grant told me that
you started taking guitar lessons.

16:31.029 --> 16:34.072
You know, the neighbours
might have one if you wanted to practice.

16:55.602 --> 16:57.335
Sorry your mum went crazy.

16:57.495 --> 16:59.677
Ow. What the fuck.

16:59.879 --> 17:01.546
He didn't mean that, Ben.

17:03.636 --> 17:04.969
Watch your language.

17:13.161 --> 17:15.178
Hey, why don't you show Ben
around the neighbourhood?

17:15.194 --> 17:16.376
Don't wanna.

17:16.393 --> 17:18.141
Jack. Jack, come here.

17:19.377 --> 17:22.574
Listen, I'm doing remote all morning,
so I don't want you boys in the house.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.404
Ma, I don't wanna go out.

17:24.657 --> 17:26.018
Hey, thanks, Ben.

17:26.865 --> 17:29.664
Listen. I don't ask you for a lot of things,
so just help me out here.

17:29.681 --> 17:32.218
Just look after your cousin this weekend.

17:32.465 --> 17:33.865
And get the last bag.

17:35.519 --> 17:38.038
You don't want to go out? Fine.
But you stay upstairs or you go out back.

17:38.055 --> 17:40.024
I don't want to see you downstairs.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.601
That's Tom's. Don't touch it.

18:25.185 --> 18:26.252
Don't sit there.

18:34.723 --> 18:38.115
Jesus Christ, dude.
Take your fucking bag off.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.940
Look. I'm not your babysitter, alright?

18:46.390 --> 18:49.990
If you want something to do,
I got some old toys under my bed.

18:55.850 --> 18:56.850
Go on.

19:06.221 --> 19:10.687
Look. I got some rules
to set straight while you're here, alright?

19:11.566 --> 19:14.671
First, if you see any people
I know, you don't talk.

19:14.688 --> 19:15.888
Like, at all.

19:16.448 --> 19:20.424
Like, even if they ask you a question like
"What's your name?" You don't answer.

19:20.778 --> 19:25.165
Second, I don't want you talking about
anything we did when we were kids, okay?

19:26.898 --> 19:29.514
I mean... I guess if you're not talking at all,
it won't be a problem.

19:29.531 --> 19:32.424
But even if you had to talk,
which you shouldn't,

19:32.441 --> 19:34.319
I don't want you talking about that stuff.

19:34.710 --> 19:35.901
Got that?

19:37.620 --> 19:38.620
Yeah.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.577
Do you have a ball for this?

19:52.829 --> 19:54.029
Get ready to duck.

19:54.606 --> 19:57.346
I don't want to hit you in the face,
and you go crying and get me in trouble.

19:57.451 --> 19:58.303
Okay.

19:58.389 --> 20:01.240
If it does hit you in the face though,
just say you fell over or some shit.

20:01.257 --> 20:02.620
Okay? While we were playing catch.

20:02.637 --> 20:03.411
Okay.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.388
Oh, and if it goes into
the neighbours yard, you gotta go get it.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.470
'Cause if they see me
in there again, I'm fucked.

20:07.699 --> 20:09.665
- Okay.
- Alright.

20:09.759 --> 20:10.759
Let's see it.

20:13.623 --> 20:14.623
Fuck.

20:14.893 --> 20:15.893
What was that?

20:16.846 --> 20:18.753
Throw it-
You gotta throw it proper.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.111
Like this. You see?

20:21.618 --> 20:22.618
You see that?

20:23.044 --> 20:24.644
I think that's softball.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.115
It's not. It's fucking baseball,
that's what it is.

20:28.324 --> 20:29.970
Throw it like that this time.

20:30.609 --> 20:31.609
You ready?

20:38.434 --> 20:39.434
Fuck.

20:39.451 --> 20:41.441
You're not doing it right.
You're putting-

20:41.458 --> 20:43.192
You're putting a curve on it.

20:55.544 --> 20:58.323
I think that's like six strikes.

20:58.935 --> 20:59.935
Is not.

21:01.103 --> 21:02.431
You're throwing it all over the place.

21:02.448 --> 21:04.502
You're throwing like balls and shit.

21:04.519 --> 21:06.605
I should be walking home by now.

21:06.865 --> 21:09.417
Alright, you know what smartass.
You wanna try?

21:09.691 --> 21:11.157
Alright, let's see it.

21:13.050 --> 21:15.218
I'm gonna throw it just like you did.

21:15.394 --> 21:16.660
Alright, you ready?

21:26.214 --> 21:27.214
Jack!

21:36.390 --> 21:37.723
That was a good hit.

21:38.011 --> 21:39.011
Thanks.

21:40.394 --> 21:41.660
You play on a team?

21:41.963 --> 21:42.963
Yeah.

21:43.551 --> 21:45.608
Got, like, uniforms and stuff?

21:46.103 --> 21:47.103
Yeah.

21:47.536 --> 21:48.536
That's cool.

21:50.159 --> 21:51.693
Tom did that for a bit.

21:51.989 --> 21:53.189
Played for school.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.880
They had some ugly ass uniforms.

21:56.364 --> 21:57.631
I still wanted one.

21:59.261 --> 22:00.794
Sorry about the window.

22:04.411 --> 22:05.811
Sorry about your mom.

22:10.732 --> 22:13.095
You wanna talk about it?

22:13.363 --> 22:14.363
Not really.

22:20.107 --> 22:22.374
So what's there to do around here?

22:25.029 --> 22:26.029
Fuck all.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.451
Alright.

22:32.468 --> 22:34.290
So I'm going to try hit the window.

22:35.348 --> 22:36.815
Ooh. No, that was bad.

22:37.978 --> 22:39.807
- Nearly.
- You ready? Ready?

22:39.886 --> 22:41.663
I can usually do it with a baseball.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.796
There we go.

22:43.063 --> 22:44.063
See?

22:44.268 --> 22:45.334
Come on. Try it.

22:47.327 --> 22:48.927
Just get a little [???].

22:51.325 --> 22:52.325
Just like that.

22:52.464 --> 22:53.619
Pass it back to you.

22:53.808 --> 22:56.141
And the just get ready to catch it.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.308
I got you.

23:06.497 --> 23:08.208
Who's your favorite superhero?

23:08.489 --> 23:10.089
I have to say Spider-man.

23:11.347 --> 23:13.014
Guess who my favorite is.

23:13.664 --> 23:15.363
- Superman?
- No.

23:16.588 --> 23:17.588
The Flash?

23:18.984 --> 23:20.139
- Come on.
- Batman?

23:20.156 --> 23:21.156
Yes.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.215
You know why Batman's the best?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.325
Because he doesn't have any super powers

23:25.342 --> 23:29.758
and he's still one of the greatest
super heroes of all time.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.447
If you could pick any two super powers,

23:32.464 --> 23:36.733
- Oh, I know. Definitely invisibility.
- which two super powers would you pick?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.159
Why invisibility?

23:38.302 --> 23:39.396
Because...

23:39.572 --> 23:44.298
There's a lot of times when I'm at home
and I just don't want to be.

23:44.826 --> 23:47.292
- Alright.
- And I also want to fly.

23:47.814 --> 23:49.064
What about you?

23:50.300 --> 23:52.126
Super speed for sure.

23:52.143 --> 23:56.349
And I'm afraid of heights.
I don't like heights. So not flying.

23:56.694 --> 23:58.561
Why do you want to be really fast?

23:58.578 --> 24:00.379
I dunno. It just seems cool.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.152
- Oh, did that go in?
- That went in.

24:03.169 --> 24:04.324
It did?

24:05.535 --> 24:07.104
- Bullseye.
- Oh, you got one. Alright.

24:07.121 --> 24:08.123
Twenty points.

24:08.140 --> 24:10.047
Well, you're good at baseball.

24:16.466 --> 24:20.125
See, it's not that hard.
You just have to make that hard P sound.

24:25.451 --> 24:26.451
Yo, Scab!

24:27.436 --> 24:28.569
Hey, where are you going?

24:28.586 --> 24:29.715
Away.

24:30.522 --> 24:32.573
Hey, you got a cigarette for me by any chance?

24:32.590 --> 24:33.641
No.

24:34.162 --> 24:35.450
You give one to your boyfriend over here?

24:35.467 --> 24:36.856
He's my cousin, dick.

24:36.873 --> 24:39.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What did you just say?

24:41.141 --> 24:42.607
Hey, what did you say?

24:43.888 --> 24:46.310
Nothing. I don't have any more cigarettes.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.067
No. What did you call him, man?

24:50.021 --> 24:51.021
Nothing.

24:52.710 --> 24:53.710
Nothing?

24:56.823 --> 24:57.488
Huh?

24:57.505 --> 24:58.947
He's the one calling me a fag.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.243
I ain't call you a fag.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.313
No, no. He said that
this was your boyfriend.

25:02.456 --> 25:04.461
He didn't call you a faggot, did he?

25:05.457 --> 25:06.457
Did he?

25:07.762 --> 25:09.057
Huh? Did he?

25:09.845 --> 25:10.845
Did he?

25:13.185 --> 25:14.518
Get the fuck off me.

25:14.988 --> 25:16.407
Get the fuck off.

25:17.130 --> 25:20.047
- Watch how you talk to me, Scab.
- Get the fuck off me.

25:20.064 --> 25:23.107
I said watch how you fucking talk to me.

25:23.973 --> 25:24.973
Stop.

25:25.229 --> 25:27.096
Yo. Man.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.814
[???] for the ciggie.

25:35.679 --> 25:36.679
Hey.

25:37.150 --> 25:40.217
Didn't know you were
a little chubby chaser.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.566
Go. Run along with your little boyfriend.

25:57.287 --> 25:58.751
Ow. Fuck.

26:05.158 --> 26:06.491
You're fucking dead.

26:17.651 --> 26:18.651
Come on.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.160
Get under.

26:43.784 --> 26:45.001
Shit man.

26:48.413 --> 26:49.880
Yo. Let's go this way.

27:48.973 --> 27:51.140
Why did that kid call you Scab?

27:51.193 --> 27:53.193
'Cause he's a dick.

27:55.119 --> 27:57.237
Some kids call me Schizo,

27:57.254 --> 27:58.254
at school.

27:58.367 --> 27:59.567
They're dicks too.

27:59.839 --> 28:00.743
Come on.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.007
Why can't we go home?

28:02.024 --> 28:03.953
They'll send someone to watch out there.

28:26.584 --> 28:28.650
Don't break the fucking window.

28:29.949 --> 28:31.128
Harriet.

28:31.145 --> 28:32.830
Doofus is here.

28:38.387 --> 28:39.520
What do you want?

28:42.423 --> 28:43.557
Could we come up?

28:44.546 --> 28:47.254
You know, you were
a real dick to me, yesterday.

28:48.009 --> 28:50.593
I was just trying to help.
You know that, right?

28:52.606 --> 28:53.606
I'm Sorry.

28:56.603 --> 28:57.603
Who's that?

28:58.361 --> 28:59.539
It's my cousin.

28:59.728 --> 29:01.433
He's related to you?

29:01.558 --> 29:02.932
What's his name?

29:03.849 --> 29:04.849
Ben.

29:05.802 --> 29:07.690
Look. Can we come in now?

29:13.595 --> 29:15.595
You're not cool, but whatever.

29:15.802 --> 29:16.802
Here.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.822
Does he drink?

29:20.288 --> 29:21.288
Dunno.

29:21.421 --> 29:22.604
You ever drink?

29:26.245 --> 29:27.905
Aww, virgin.

29:29.715 --> 29:31.648
You're gonna stink up my room.

29:31.668 --> 29:33.523
Just light some incense or something.

29:33.608 --> 29:35.142
Give me a lighter then.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.182
What do you keep looking at?

29:47.199 --> 29:48.406
Nothing.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.441
It's okay. You can talk around them.

30:15.073 --> 30:16.073
Truth.

30:17.918 --> 30:18.918
Okay.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.347
Have you seen a girl down there, before?

30:28.472 --> 30:29.472
No.

30:29.949 --> 30:32.000
Little man. I think she's offering.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.715
I'm actually not, fuckhead, but thanks.

30:35.438 --> 30:37.514
Why not?
What's wrong with him?

30:37.553 --> 30:38.553
Nothing.

30:38.595 --> 30:40.195
He's a good looking guy.

30:40.223 --> 30:41.765
So? That doesn't mean
I want to fuck him.

30:41.782 --> 30:43.361
Alright, alright, guys.

30:43.986 --> 30:45.386
Jack. It's your turn.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.146
Okay. Harriet, truth or dare?

30:49.916 --> 30:50.841
Dare.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.827
Ooh. No, don't do it.

30:53.146 --> 30:55.997
It's her turn.
You can pick on your turn.

30:56.792 --> 30:58.192
What do I have to do?

30:59.084 --> 31:02.560
I dare you to flash Ben and me.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.027
Oh, come on.
Are you serious?

31:05.044 --> 31:06.987
I'm very serious.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.272
What is with you boys and tits?

31:09.289 --> 31:11.277
Seriously. You know they're just fat?

31:11.294 --> 31:14.050
- Like, it's not a big deal.
- Show us then.

31:14.227 --> 31:15.760
If it's not a big deal.

31:19.207 --> 31:20.207
Okay.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.172
All good.

31:24.988 --> 31:28.087
I don't think Ben saw.
Did you see that, Ben?

31:30.150 --> 31:32.392
- He must've missed it.
- Oh, I...

31:32.618 --> 31:34.665
You're a little perv, aren't you?
I fucking knew it.

31:34.682 --> 31:36.376
I knew he would be a little perv.

31:36.393 --> 31:38.431
Come on. Shirt up.

31:39.454 --> 31:41.141
Okay. Fine.

31:44.705 --> 31:45.705
See?

31:46.173 --> 31:47.556
No big deal.

31:49.189 --> 31:50.798
Everyone get a good look?

31:50.845 --> 31:52.579
Good? Okay, that's enough.

31:53.189 --> 31:55.056
Seven out of ten, I'd say.

31:55.298 --> 31:56.298
Ten.

31:56.541 --> 31:57.665
Definite ten.

31:58.876 --> 32:01.048
- That's generous.
- Shut up.

32:01.564 --> 32:02.564
It's my turn.

32:03.111 --> 32:04.111
Jack.

32:04.259 --> 32:05.524
Truth or dare?

32:06.595 --> 32:08.767
- Truth.
- You're a fucking looser.

32:08.978 --> 32:11.173
You can't do that dare
and then pick truth.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.095
It's not the rules.
I can do what I want.

32:13.112 --> 32:14.876
Okay. Okay.

32:15.970 --> 32:17.485
Do you like Robyn?

32:19.111 --> 32:20.111
Nah, do a dare.

32:20.128 --> 32:21.689
Oh, why? 'Cause you do?

32:21.706 --> 32:23.689
Just do a dare, alright?

32:24.994 --> 32:25.994
Fine.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.618
I dare you to flash us.

32:30.533 --> 32:31.884
- No boxers though.
- Yeah.

32:31.901 --> 32:33.712
- Full off.
- Fuck off.

32:34.447 --> 32:36.290
- No I'm not doing that.
- Come on.

32:36.307 --> 32:39.314
- Yeah, you have to do it.
- No. I'm not doing that.

32:39.331 --> 32:40.986
You made me flash.

32:41.003 --> 32:42.900
- Your turn.
- That was the fucking dare. Come on.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.915
- No. No, give me another one. Come on.
- No, you have to choose between those two.

32:45.932 --> 32:47.962
- Come on.
- Let's go.

32:52.455 --> 32:53.455
Alright.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.587
- But only if Ben does it too.
- What?

32:55.767 --> 32:56.922
- Come on, Ben.
- No way.

32:56.939 --> 33:00.111
Yeah. You go first
and I promise I won't look.

33:00.130 --> 33:01.083
You gotta go.

33:01.100 --> 33:01.973
- Come on.
- No.

33:01.990 --> 33:03.895
Now, come on, Ben.
You do it, he does it. Let's go.

33:03.913 --> 33:08.248
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

33:08.265 --> 33:09.616
Come on, Ben.
Let's go!

33:10.257 --> 33:11.757
Ben! Come on!

33:11.774 --> 33:13.366
- Go for it.
- Come one.

33:13.383 --> 33:14.460
Let's go.

33:14.476 --> 33:15.693
- Let's go.
- Ben.

33:15.710 --> 33:17.178
Come on.
It's the only way he'll go.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.397
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.015
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

33:22.054 --> 33:23.569
Ben! Yeah!

33:26.366 --> 33:28.702
- Come on, Ben.
- Whoo! Ben

33:35.093 --> 33:36.405
Oh my God.

33:38.421 --> 33:40.272
- Did you do it?
- You're insane.

33:40.406 --> 33:41.772
Oh, you actually did it.

33:41.789 --> 33:44.499
- That was great.
- That looked pretty good to me.

33:44.843 --> 33:47.343
- That looked really good to you?
- Yeah, that looked pretty good to me.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.773
Oh. Give it a kiss, then.

33:48.790 --> 33:51.421
Oh, fuck off dickhead.
It's your turn.

33:51.438 --> 33:52.913
No way. I didn't think
he was going to do it.

33:52.937 --> 33:54.334
- But he did it.
- You have to.

33:54.351 --> 33:56.146
- It's your turn.
- So? Fuck you. I'm not doing it.

33:58.476 --> 34:00.178
- Come on.
- I'm not doing it, alright.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.639
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

34:01.656 --> 34:03.132
- No.
- You gotta do it.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.991
You have to do it. Let's go.

34:06.008 --> 34:08.295
- I'm not doing it.
- You're suck a pussy.

34:08.531 --> 34:09.905
Give me another one.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.100
- No. Those are your only two shots.
- That's it.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.373
You have to pick between those two.

34:15.288 --> 34:16.688
Which one will it be?

34:18.155 --> 34:19.355
I'll give you one.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.205
- Alright. This will be good.
- What do you got?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.080
I dare you to kiss Harriet.

34:29.007 --> 34:32.239
What, like a peck or like... spitty?

34:32.255 --> 34:33.255
No.

34:34.757 --> 34:35.757
Why?

34:36.663 --> 34:37.730
'Cause. Just no.

34:39.530 --> 34:41.257
So you can see my tits,
but you can't kiss me?

34:41.274 --> 34:43.842
- Nah. It ain't like that.
- Bullshit.

34:44.764 --> 34:46.036
Yeah, jeez... what...

34:46.054 --> 34:48.483
Like, what's wrong with you,
you can't fucking kiss her?

34:49.092 --> 34:51.366
No. It's just...
It's just a dumbass game.

34:51.585 --> 34:53.616
What the fuck, Scab.
Just give her a kiss.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.991
- He'd do it if it was Robyn.
- No.

35:00.686 --> 35:02.710
Fine. Whatever. I'll do it.

35:02.727 --> 35:05.101
No. I don't want you to do it
if it's so horrible and shit.

35:05.118 --> 35:07.093
It's not horrible and shit.

35:08.312 --> 35:09.312
Just...

35:10.687 --> 35:14.483
What? It's just a fucking kiss.
Haven't you  kissed anyone before?

35:14.828 --> 35:15.843
Yeah.

35:20.031 --> 35:21.944
Oh my God.
No you haven't.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.897
Yeah, I have. Loads of people.

35:25.991 --> 35:27.291
Yeah? Like who?

35:29.273 --> 35:30.739
You wouldn't know em'.

35:33.507 --> 35:34.507
Okay.

35:37.812 --> 35:40.078
Fuck off. Don't tell anyone, yeah?

35:40.327 --> 35:43.069
I mean it.
Don't tell anyone.

35:43.843 --> 35:44.843
None of you.

35:47.937 --> 35:48.937
Well...

35:51.562 --> 35:52.895
- Yep. Alright.
- I won't.

35:54.577 --> 35:55.977
I don't know anybody.

36:01.171 --> 36:03.178
Um, so...

36:03.195 --> 36:04.499
do you wanna?

36:06.062 --> 36:07.062
What?

36:08.937 --> 36:09.937
Kiss me.

36:13.757 --> 36:14.757
Alright.

36:42.726 --> 36:44.202
Yo, Harriet!

36:45.554 --> 36:46.554
- Harriet!
- Oh, fuck off.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.241
Harri!

36:50.999 --> 36:52.133
What do you want?

36:52.202 --> 36:54.802
A little bird told me Scab's at your house.

36:54.976 --> 36:56.376
He ain't here, Shane.

36:57.702 --> 36:59.171
Who are you talking to then?

36:59.188 --> 37:00.296
Holly.

37:00.796 --> 37:02.405
Hey, Shane.

37:02.632 --> 37:04.507
Holly, you can't say "hi" to me?

37:04.554 --> 37:05.687
What do you want?

37:06.248 --> 37:08.116
Just you two girls then, huh?

37:08.148 --> 37:09.148
Yeah.

37:10.257 --> 37:12.288
Well. We'll text you
if we see them though.

37:12.305 --> 37:14.210
We can't just come up and
hang out with you guys?

37:14.227 --> 37:15.953
Shoot the shit. I know
you're all bored up there.

37:15.970 --> 37:17.656
We're kinda having girls time right now so...

37:17.673 --> 37:19.781
Oh. They're having girls time.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.468
Is your dad here?

37:21.663 --> 37:22.600
Yeah.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.225
Really? 'Cause I don't see
his car anywhere.

37:27.273 --> 37:28.406
It's in the shop.

37:28.882 --> 37:30.482
Harriet, just let us up.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.288
- No, Beavan.
- No?!

37:33.929 --> 37:34.929
Run.

37:43.111 --> 37:45.178
Get back here, you little shit.

37:50.807 --> 37:51.807
Jack!

37:54.025 --> 37:55.556
Yo, leave him. Leave him.

37:56.346 --> 37:57.720
He ain't going far.

38:06.010 --> 38:07.010
Jack?!

38:09.643 --> 38:10.643
Jack?!

38:12.361 --> 38:16.361
Why don't you come save
your little boyfriend huh, scouch?

38:17.416 --> 38:19.283
What's your name, boyfriend?

38:19.486 --> 38:20.486
Huh?

38:20.503 --> 38:22.173
- What's your name?
- Ben.

38:22.744 --> 38:26.077
You're gonna leave little Ben here,
all alone, with us?

38:35.088 --> 38:37.791
You know you're only
making this worse, right?

38:39.674 --> 38:41.197
Let him go, man.

38:43.471 --> 38:44.471
Sure.

38:44.619 --> 38:47.142
Yeah, I'll let him go.
Just come out here.

38:47.315 --> 38:48.916
He didn't do anything.

38:50.283 --> 38:52.548
No. But you did, Scab.

38:55.775 --> 38:56.775
Look...

38:57.525 --> 39:00.125
You come out now,
then I'll let him go.

39:01.744 --> 39:03.478
You wait around though...

39:12.166 --> 39:13.166
Alright.

39:13.791 --> 39:17.127
Guess we're gonna have to take
little Ben, here, back to ours.

39:19.158 --> 39:24.517
Look. When you find your balls. We'll be
at Beav's waiting for you to come pick him up.

39:26.315 --> 39:28.781
Don't make us wait too long, alright?

39:30.338 --> 39:33.271
We're gonna have fun with you, little piggy.

39:40.869 --> 39:42.736
He's probably still running.

39:45.354 --> 39:48.119
How's your boyfriend
gonna leave you like that, man.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.986
Yo. Look at his titties, boy.

39:50.003 --> 39:51.633
Maybe we should milk them.

39:52.065 --> 39:53.998
Look at your white ass chest.

39:55.549 --> 39:57.767
Yo. Hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up.

39:59.455 --> 40:01.922
He deserves a fighting chance, right?

40:07.979 --> 40:09.345
Hey, chipmunk...

40:10.127 --> 40:12.060
You wanna play a little game?

40:13.783 --> 40:14.752
Look, look, look.

40:14.769 --> 40:16.275
If you-
If you win,

40:16.292 --> 40:18.041
then, you know, we'll sit here, you know...

40:18.058 --> 40:21.956
We'll chill out, you know, watch some
TV until your boyfriend shows up.

40:22.907 --> 40:24.040
How's that sound?

40:26.470 --> 40:27.470
Answer?

40:30.352 --> 40:32.219
Hey, I asked you a question.

40:35.852 --> 40:37.652
Do you want to play a game?

40:40.329 --> 40:42.336
Alright. It's real simple.

40:44.954 --> 40:46.487
I'm gonna count to ten.

40:47.290 --> 40:52.172
If you're still holding that
by the time I count to ten, then you win.

40:52.727 --> 40:56.015
But if you drop it before I get to ten,

40:56.032 --> 40:57.032
you lose.

40:57.517 --> 40:58.719
You got it?

41:04.399 --> 41:05.399
Ready?

41:15.876 --> 41:16.876
One.

41:18.329 --> 41:19.329
Two.

41:20.384 --> 41:21.384
Three.

41:23.110 --> 41:24.383
Four.

41:25.704 --> 41:27.016
Five.

41:28.056 --> 41:29.313
Six.

41:38.173 --> 41:39.173
You lose.

41:53.095 --> 41:54.095
Ow.

41:56.946 --> 41:57.946
Oh shit.

41:58.626 --> 42:00.293
Why you looking down for?

42:00.509 --> 42:01.664
- Yeah.
- Head up.

42:01.681 --> 42:03.626
Head up, son. Head up.

42:04.454 --> 42:06.899
Wish your boyfriend was here, huh?

42:09.267 --> 42:10.933
That feel good, baby boy?

42:12.345 --> 42:13.745
Are you about to cry?

42:14.407 --> 42:16.180
Yo. That one is so bad, over there.

42:16.767 --> 42:17.767
You ready?

42:25.157 --> 42:26.922
Oh. You close!

42:27.235 --> 42:28.235
You close.

42:28.252 --> 42:30.141
Alright, alright.
One more time, One more time.

42:33.493 --> 42:34.693
To the right, man.

42:35.368 --> 42:36.968
Come on. You ain't shit.

42:38.688 --> 42:40.422
Yo. Ten bucks, bare chest.

42:42.618 --> 42:43.977
Oh, yeah!.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.032
That's a hit.

42:48.071 --> 42:50.055
Feel bad for you now, bro.

42:51.868 --> 42:53.068
The hell was that?

42:55.696 --> 42:58.274
Hey. Is that you, Scab?

43:00.665 --> 43:01.844
Yo, Scab!

43:02.438 --> 43:04.972
This thing draws blood at close range.

43:04.993 --> 43:07.547
If you don't want your boyfriend to bleed,

43:07.564 --> 43:09.805
you better come out right now.

43:17.798 --> 43:18.798
Scab!

43:22.110 --> 43:24.453
[???] Shane. That's it.

43:25.142 --> 43:26.461
He ain't here.

43:27.204 --> 43:28.766
Better get here soon.

43:30.431 --> 43:33.555
- Open fire.
- Sorry, your boyfriend ain't coming to save you.

43:55.907 --> 43:56.907
Tom!

43:58.118 --> 43:59.118
Tom!

44:09.735 --> 44:11.985
No, no, no. He's moving around.
Get off the ropes.

44:13.227 --> 44:14.945
Move out of there! Get out of there!

44:14.962 --> 44:16.028
He's going down!

44:16.720 --> 44:18.180
That's what I'm talking about.

44:18.204 --> 44:21.117
Fucking right. Give me my money.
Give me my money.

44:21.243 --> 44:22.977
Come on man, hurry up.

44:25.024 --> 44:26.571
Where's my money bro?

44:28.407 --> 44:30.305
Yo. You got my money, or what?
What's up?

44:30.829 --> 44:33.162
I'm gonna give it to you next week.

44:33.259 --> 44:35.711
I've been hearing that a lot lately, man.

44:36.563 --> 44:37.563
Tom.

44:40.852 --> 44:41.852
Jack?

44:59.907 --> 45:01.974
Don't tell mom about the fight.

45:05.626 --> 45:07.078
How much do you owe?

45:08.712 --> 45:10.024
Enough.

45:36.220 --> 45:37.532
Relax. I'm coming.

45:38.321 --> 45:39.321
Yo, man.

45:40.399 --> 45:41.399
Where is he?!

45:42.227 --> 45:43.953
He's out back, man!

45:44.149 --> 45:45.149
Come on, man!

45:45.829 --> 45:47.102
Hey, dude, what the fuck?!

45:47.119 --> 45:49.094
Shut the fuck up, both of you!

45:56.938 --> 45:58.149
Untie him.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.172
Who's idea was this?

46:09.929 --> 46:10.929
Huh?

46:11.024 --> 46:12.219
Are you alright?

46:12.423 --> 46:13.578
Who's idea?

46:14.923 --> 46:16.789
Who's fucking idea was this?

46:19.095 --> 46:20.095
Nothing?

46:24.095 --> 46:25.095
Okay.

46:46.810 --> 46:50.044
Any of you come near
my little cousin again, that's your fucking face.

46:50.060 --> 46:51.810
You understand me?

46:53.404 --> 46:56.372
Fucking big shots
picking on a twelve year old.

46:57.301 --> 46:58.501
My dad's TV man...

46:59.209 --> 47:00.209
What was that?

47:01.646 --> 47:03.856
He said it's his dad's TV.

47:05.115 --> 47:06.781
Oh, is that what he said?

47:10.349 --> 47:14.060
Don't answer for other people.

47:15.388 --> 47:19.153
You're not even supposed
to come near me, Tom.

47:23.224 --> 47:24.841
Go ahead and squeal.

47:25.084 --> 47:28.872
I'm sure they'd love to hear
how you tied up some kid in your backyard.

47:39.334 --> 47:40.934
Ben, you got your stuff?

47:41.505 --> 47:42.505
Let's go.

48:14.263 --> 48:15.263
You okay?

48:18.535 --> 48:19.535
Ah, fuck. Ahh.

48:20.365 --> 48:22.786
How many times did I tell you
to leave Shane alone?

48:22.803 --> 48:24.115
How many times?

48:24.132 --> 48:25.247
It wasn't my fault. He-

48:25.264 --> 48:27.646
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Ow. Ow. Fuck.

48:27.825 --> 48:29.825
It's never your fucking fault.

48:32.959 --> 48:35.731
You know how much trouble
I could get into for what I did in there?

48:35.748 --> 48:37.708
Has that even crossed your mind?

48:39.943 --> 48:43.544
It doesn't right? Cause the whole
fucking world revolves around you.

48:47.388 --> 48:48.388
You okay?

48:49.802 --> 48:51.002
Wipe yourself off.

48:55.396 --> 48:58.872
When's the last time
you did something for somebody else?

49:48.951 --> 49:51.951
Tell mom I'm not going
to be home till late.

49:53.169 --> 49:54.325
Hey, Ben.

49:56.232 --> 49:57.388
Hey, wait up.

49:57.943 --> 49:58.958
Hey.

49:59.177 --> 50:00.411
You okay?

50:01.084 --> 50:02.974
Listen. I'm sorry, okay?

50:03.302 --> 50:04.841
- I'm sorry.
- Just leave me alone.

50:04.858 --> 50:07.833
- Ben. I'm sorry.
- Just leave me alone.

50:08.490 --> 50:11.669
You're not my friend.
So don't try to act like it.

50:18.701 --> 50:20.101
Home's the other way.

50:33.826 --> 50:36.177
Hey, don't tell my mom, alright?

51:10.076 --> 51:11.638
Oh, Ben, your dad called.

51:11.655 --> 51:13.826
I told him you'd call him back after dinner.

51:17.552 --> 51:19.419
So, you guys have fun today?

51:26.412 --> 51:27.412
Good.

51:28.357 --> 51:31.157
Ben, you're sleeping in
Tom's bed tonight, okay?

51:31.248 --> 51:33.714
He'll take the couch when he gets in.

52:39.044 --> 52:43.403
Hey, man, it's two players...
if you wanna...

53:13.498 --> 53:14.498
I'm sorry.

53:17.146 --> 53:19.213
I should've let them take me.

53:36.802 --> 53:39.002
You know why people call me Scab?

53:42.896 --> 53:43.896
Tom started it.

53:45.709 --> 53:46.909
When I was little.

53:51.060 --> 53:54.200
My dad had this nickname for me.

53:55.529 --> 53:57.462
He used to call me King Jack.

53:59.349 --> 54:01.185
Put me on his shoulders.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.731
Carrying me all throughout the house,

54:03.748 --> 54:06.044
saying I was the king of everything.

54:07.107 --> 54:11.130
The couch, the backyard, everything.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.647
Tom didn't like it.

54:22.013 --> 54:24.896
He used to punch me
when dad wasn't around.

54:29.021 --> 54:31.404
Pick on me at school, too.

54:32.684 --> 54:34.622
He was mad popular so...

54:34.998 --> 54:37.598
Whatever he did, everyone kinda copied.

54:42.599 --> 54:44.130
Said I wasn't a king.

54:46.146 --> 54:48.079
Wasn't even a fucking person.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.966
Just some scab.

55:07.099 --> 55:09.708
I never really had a lot of friends.

55:13.341 --> 55:15.004
Like...

55:15.021 --> 55:16.308
ever.

59:15.427 --> 59:16.583
There you are.

59:17.084 --> 59:19.130
I thought you weren't gonna make it.

59:19.216 --> 59:21.294
Oh yeah. Here I am.

59:26.982 --> 59:28.182
I like your house.

59:28.333 --> 59:29.333
Thank you.

59:33.489 --> 59:35.089
Shane isn't here, is he?

59:35.162 --> 59:36.762
No. I didn't invite him.

59:36.841 --> 59:38.075
Alright, cool.

59:42.380 --> 59:43.380
Are you okay?

59:43.451 --> 59:46.200
What? Oh yeah, yeah,
no, I'm great. Yeah.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.409
How are you doing?

59:48.873 --> 59:50.263
How am I doing?

59:51.287 --> 59:54.192
That's kind of a tough question
to ask at a party.

59:55.787 --> 59:58.021
Come on. You're too sober.

01:00:13.998 --> 01:00:15.661
Come on. It's not that bad.

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.341
Does your mom use that stuff
to clean the house?

01:00:18.654 --> 01:00:21.185
Fuck you. That's my drink.

01:00:22.373 --> 01:00:25.106
I don't share it with everyone, you know.

01:00:29.318 --> 01:00:32.786
Hey, look, I wanted to say I was sorry,

01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:36.247
about yesterday, with the photo.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.310
- I didn't mean to show it to the girls, they just-
- Whatever.

01:00:40.327 --> 01:00:42.787
No, really. It was shitty.

01:00:45.162 --> 01:00:46.302
A little bit.

01:00:46.755 --> 01:00:48.169
A little bit?

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.458
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.099
Like a lot of bit.

01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:57.528
Alright, yeah, like a lot of bit.

01:00:58.216 --> 01:01:00.911
So... apology shot?

01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:02.731
No, no, no. It's cool.

01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:04.341
- Take it.
- No. I'm fine.

01:01:04.358 --> 01:01:05.730
- Take it.
- It's cool. It's fine.

01:01:05.747 --> 01:01:08.199
Come on. Or else
I'm gonna feel bad all night.

01:01:11.199 --> 01:01:12.733
Alright. Alright, fine.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:21.944
Can I tell you something?

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.980
Yeah.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:27.039
About the photo?

01:01:36.646 --> 01:01:37.779
I kinda liked it.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:34.594
Don't look at me like that.

01:02:34.795 --> 01:02:35.990
Like what?

01:02:37.271 --> 01:02:39.903
I don't like it when boys look at me like that.

01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:41.287
Like what?

01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:43.830
Close your eyes.

01:02:44.271 --> 01:02:45.271
Okay.

01:03:00.732 --> 01:03:01.732
No peaking.

01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:02.919
Okay.

01:03:12.341 --> 01:03:13.808
Tell me what you want.

01:03:16.271 --> 01:03:17.738
Tell me what you want.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:19.825
This is good.

01:03:20.099 --> 01:03:21.099
Yeah?

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:23.599
Yeah.

01:03:49.755 --> 01:03:50.755
Robyn?

01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:53.341
Robyn?

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.083
Hey, Scab.

01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:58.019
Get the fuck out.
No stop.

01:03:58.273 --> 01:03:59.273
Shut up.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:04.218
Hey.

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:05.695
I thought it was just a joke.

01:04:05.712 --> 01:04:07.381
Yo, get the fuck
out of here right now.

01:04:07.398 --> 01:04:10.484
- No. It's my house Shane.
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:15.863
Yo, turn the camera off, man.

01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:19.187
Turn it off.

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:26.132
You guys wanna go downstairs
and make sure she's not making a fucking scene?

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:28.242
Huh?

01:04:38.273 --> 01:04:40.273
Where's your brother now, huh?

01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:43.499
He's not here to save you?

01:04:46.594 --> 01:04:49.406
Maybe you shouldn't have have
brought him around today, you little fucker.

01:04:49.423 --> 01:04:50.930
That was a bad idea.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920
Fuck.

01:04:56.344 --> 01:04:57.344
Fuck.

01:05:00.234 --> 01:05:01.901
Come on. He went outside.

01:05:06.258 --> 01:05:08.070
Help! Help! Help! Help!

01:05:08.117 --> 01:05:09.117
Hey, shut up!

01:05:09.734 --> 01:05:10.868
Shut the fuck up.

01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:14.357
Don't move or I'll take out your eye.

01:05:21.023 --> 01:05:22.223
Works, doesn't it.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.719
Your brother used to say that.

01:05:29.881 --> 01:05:31.948
You're gonna remember me, Scab.

01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:37.796
Everyday, when you wake up
and look in that mirror.

01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:40.010
You're gonna remember me.

01:05:58.086 --> 01:05:59.367
C'mon!

01:05:59.384 --> 01:06:00.718
C'mon!

01:06:01.594 --> 01:06:03.781
- Let's go, Jack!
- You're fucking dead.

01:06:03.844 --> 01:06:05.335
Jack! Now!

01:06:05.844 --> 01:06:08.515
You're fucking dead, you little shit.

01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:14.172
- You're fucking dead!
- Leave him alone!

01:06:15.227 --> 01:06:16.437
- Come here!
- Whoa, Shane.

01:06:16.454 --> 01:06:18.203
I said leave him alone!

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.445
Get outta my house, assholes.

01:06:20.766 --> 01:06:24.555
- Yo Shane, we gotta get outta here.
- I said get outta here, Shane.

01:06:25.758 --> 01:06:27.000
Move, Scab.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.375
No.

01:06:30.266 --> 01:06:32.117
I said move, Scab!

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:34.197
That's not my name.

01:06:46.938 --> 01:06:50.530
When I tell you to do something, Scab,

01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:51.827
you do it!

01:06:51.844 --> 01:06:53.492
You fucking do it!

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.363
What are you looking at, huh?

01:07:17.493 --> 01:07:18.493
Stay down.

01:07:19.179 --> 01:07:22.131
Stay the fuck down.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.414
What are you looking at?!
Go home!

01:07:37.079 --> 01:07:38.079
Go!

01:07:45.196 --> 01:07:47.086
No, man! Chill!.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.617
Chill. That's enough.

01:07:54.188 --> 01:07:56.234
Stop. He ain't moving.

01:08:59.383 --> 01:09:00.917
I said leave him alone.

01:10:07.094 --> 01:10:08.297
Whoa.

01:10:08.314 --> 01:10:09.625
It's alive.

01:10:10.329 --> 01:10:11.329
Mom.

01:10:11.906 --> 01:10:12.906
Is he up?

01:10:16.414 --> 01:10:17.897
Hey. Back down.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:19.211
Don't move.

01:10:20.047 --> 01:10:21.314
When did he get up.

01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:22.641
Just now.

01:10:23.399 --> 01:10:24.599
Hey, are you okay?

01:10:28.454 --> 01:10:30.094
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:10:34.789 --> 01:10:37.344
You know you scared
the shit out of me, right?

01:10:43.609 --> 01:10:45.078
Emma came by from the hospital.

01:10:45.095 --> 01:10:48.953
She said you had a cracked rib.
Maybe a mild concussion.

01:10:49.196 --> 01:10:51.596
That it could have been a lot worse.

01:10:58.446 --> 01:10:59.846
I'm glad you're okay.

01:11:03.415 --> 01:11:05.681
Hey, Pete, he just fucking got up.

01:11:05.698 --> 01:11:06.946
Sorry.

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:12.125
The sooner I can ask him a couple of questions,
the sooner I can get out of here.

01:11:13.383 --> 01:11:15.050
How are you feeling Jack?

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.860
Tired.

01:11:18.743 --> 01:11:22.109
Nobody from the party's talking,
so you wanna tell me what happened to you?

01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:35.578
I fell off my bike.

01:11:36.165 --> 01:11:37.165
Jack.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.511
Must have fell pretty hard.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.844
I was going pretty fast.

01:11:46.407 --> 01:11:47.407
Great.

01:11:47.782 --> 01:11:50.449
Well. I'm glad I stuck around for that.

01:11:51.594 --> 01:11:55.124
Look, if he changes his mind
and he wants to press charges or something,

01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.617
you know where to find me.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.820
And I don't want to get to know you
like I know your brother.

01:12:00.094 --> 01:12:01.602
Love you too, Pete.

01:12:01.619 --> 01:12:03.109
Go fuck yourself.

01:12:07.922 --> 01:12:09.456
You fell off your bike?

01:12:15.672 --> 01:12:17.531
Okay, look...

01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:21.211
You don't wanna tell me
what happened last night? That's fine.

01:12:21.228 --> 01:12:23.898
But it's never happening again,
you hear me?

01:12:28.203 --> 01:12:32.492
I don't know what's going on in your head,
but something has gotta change.

01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:37.721
You could be a good kid if you wanted.

01:12:48.008 --> 01:12:49.297
I'm sorry, Ma.

01:12:54.774 --> 01:12:55.774
I know.

01:12:57.243 --> 01:13:01.509
But you are not leaving this house
for the rest of this summer.

01:13:40.829 --> 01:13:41.829
Thanks.

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.463
For coming back for me.

01:13:51.524 --> 01:13:52.657
Don't mention it.

01:13:59.594 --> 01:14:01.117
How did we get home?

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:06.375
Some of the older boys
took you in their car.

01:14:09.954 --> 01:14:11.148
Was it cool?

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:12.875
Yeah.

01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:14.558
It was pretty cool.

01:14:40.594 --> 01:14:41.834
Hey, doofus.

01:14:43.368 --> 01:14:44.368
Hey.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.040
Hey.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.584
How are you feeling?

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:53.617
Been better.

01:14:56.336 --> 01:14:57.870
Robyn says she's sorry.

01:14:59.032 --> 01:15:00.032
Whatever.

01:15:00.805 --> 01:15:04.102
She says you should go visit her
when you're feeling better.

01:15:04.774 --> 01:15:05.774
I'll pass.

01:15:08.446 --> 01:15:10.648
You know you're still a dick, right?

01:15:12.438 --> 01:15:13.438
Yeah.

01:15:22.665 --> 01:15:23.867
I'm sorry.

01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:29.329
Whatever.

01:15:33.743 --> 01:15:34.836
What's that?

01:15:35.102 --> 01:15:37.569
There's your clothes from the party.

01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:40.969
There's no money in the wallet.
But that's how I found it.

01:15:40.986 --> 01:15:42.094
Honest.

01:15:42.899 --> 01:15:43.899
Thanks.

01:15:48.399 --> 01:15:50.266
I brought you something, too.

01:15:58.547 --> 01:15:59.547
I made it.

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:03.274
I thought it would make you feel better.
Or whatever.

01:16:07.133 --> 01:16:09.352
