WEBVTT

00:08.802 --> 00:10.136
Viktor, we got her.

00:14.933 --> 00:15.934
Gun.

01:20.165 --> 01:22.709
Well, you found us.
Come on in, Padre. How you doing?

01:22.792 --> 01:23.793
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.006
This is your
friend's place?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.174
Yeah, Denis.

01:29.966 --> 01:31.509
Wait till you meet him.
He's hysterical.

01:31.593 --> 01:32.969
You're gonna love him.
There he is.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.054
How you doing, Denis?
Morning, mate.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.268
He's just tired, that's all.
Don't worry about that.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.520
So, looking for God?
How'd it go?

01:42.604 --> 01:43.855
It's hard to say.

01:44.731 --> 01:48.026
But for a first night,
it was definitely interesting.

01:48.735 --> 01:49.903
I met this woman.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.406
No, not like that.
She was in trouble,

01:54.157 --> 01:55.283
so I helped her.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.785
That's great.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.953
- Helping's nice.
- Never mind.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.747
- Where's Tulip?
- Tulip?

02:01.539 --> 02:02.707
She's still sleeping?

02:02.791 --> 02:04.083
No, no, she went out.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.295
- Out?
- Yeah.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.588
- Where?
- I don't know.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.298
- When?
- When, what?

02:10.381 --> 02:11.549
Did she go out?

02:12.342 --> 02:13.343
Last night.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.972
So she went out in
the middle of the night and didn't say

02:18.056 --> 02:21.017
where, or why,
or when she'd be back?

02:21.100 --> 02:22.644
Yeah.
Maybe you should call,

02:22.727 --> 02:24.813
just check in,
make sure she's all right.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.064
It's weird, isn't it?

02:27.899 --> 02:28.900
For Tulip?

02:30.109 --> 02:31.319
No, it's pretty typical.

02:32.612 --> 02:34.030
I'm gonna take a nap.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.324
Oh! Uh...

02:36.407 --> 02:37.659
Bedroom's
down the hall, there.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.870
Yeah,
that's the one.

02:44.457 --> 02:45.458
Sleep tight.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.239
No!

03:17.198 --> 03:18.741
No!

03:41.139 --> 03:42.140
Keep at it.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.726
This might be one of
those all-day things.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.504
So?

04:15.715 --> 04:17.175
What are we gonna do
with you?

04:59.801 --> 05:00.885
Hello?

05:03.179 --> 05:04.180
Hello.

05:06.808 --> 05:08.226
Who's there?

05:29.122 --> 05:30.581
What's going on?

05:31.249 --> 05:32.750
The whole block's down?

05:33.835 --> 05:34.836
Most unusual.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.088
Routine maintenance,
I guess.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.382
We better get
back to our hells.

05:39.882 --> 05:40.925
They'll be back soon.

05:41.009 --> 05:42.010
Yeah.

05:42.093 --> 05:44.262
Run along,
granny goody-two-shoes.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.222
I just don't want
to get in trouble.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.765
Hey, idiot.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.309
You're in hell.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.312
You're already in trouble.

05:53.771 --> 05:54.772
Hey.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.572
Leave her alone.

06:05.283 --> 06:07.410
Holy shit.

06:08.453 --> 06:11.664
My frickin' Jesus,
check out New Guy.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.500
Oh, my God, dude.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.921
All right, dude, I gotta
ask you a question, you gotta be honest.

06:19.005 --> 06:21.966
Has anyone ever told you
that your face is disgusting?

06:23.634 --> 06:26.387
It's like your face is
one big, giant sphincter.

06:27.013 --> 06:28.347
I'm gonna put my
meat in your mouth

06:28.431 --> 06:30.433
and have oral and
anal at the same time.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.730
All right, Tyler.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.150
That is enough.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.487
What? We're just
having some fun.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.571
Yeah.

06:44.322 --> 06:46.532
And now the fun is over.

06:58.211 --> 07:00.046
What if it isn't over,

07:01.130 --> 07:02.215
<i>Mein FÃ¼hrer?</i>

07:05.051 --> 07:06.094
What if the fun's
just beginning?

07:06.177 --> 07:08.554
What are we gonna
do about that then?

07:12.475 --> 07:13.518
Huh?

07:21.859 --> 07:24.028
Go back to your hells.

07:24.904 --> 07:25.988
Quick.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.836
Once the machine starts,
the doors lock.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.505
You can come in
my hell if you want.

07:45.508 --> 07:46.509
Suit yourself.

07:47.552 --> 07:49.595
But they will put
you in the hole.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.354
That was brave.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.194
Sticking up for the gypsy.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.906
You're Hitler.

08:10.283 --> 08:11.284
Yes.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.580
You started World War Two.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.250
I did. Yes.

08:22.712 --> 08:24.172
You killed like...

08:24.255 --> 08:25.756
...millions of people.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.676
I did terrible things.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.560
Here we go again.

09:14.472 --> 09:18.142
Two of your best
plum cakes, please. Extra flaky crust, <i>danke.</i>

09:23.064 --> 09:24.065
<i>Guten tag.</i>

09:24.148 --> 09:25.358
Elsa, there you are.

09:25.441 --> 09:28.319
- I just ordered plum cakes.
- Oh, yummy.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.821
I dropped by your
house yesterday.

09:30.905 --> 09:31.989
Oh, did you?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.825
I had to help my
mother at the store.

09:40.748 --> 09:41.749
Excuse me.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.759
Yes, of course. My fault.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.095
<i>- Guten tag.
- Guten tag.</i>

09:58.724 --> 10:01.269
I'm sorry, you were saying,
you were helping your mother.

10:01.352 --> 10:04.272
Adolf, see that
man with the hat?

10:04.897 --> 10:08.025
That's Herman Hoehne,
the gallery owner I told you about.

10:08.693 --> 10:09.902
We're old friends.

10:09.986 --> 10:11.779
You must show
him your drawings.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.155
Oh...

10:13.239 --> 10:14.240
They're not ready.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.033
That is what you
always say.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.120
You have such talent,
you must...

10:24.417 --> 10:28.546
Communists.
They're all vermin. They should be exiled.

10:29.422 --> 10:30.798
Yes, I suppose so.

10:31.549 --> 10:32.633
You disagree?

10:33.467 --> 10:37.388
The Communists are scum,
infiltrating our society.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.349
Yes, no. Of course
you are right. Yes.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.560
Vermin.
That is exactly right.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.063
Yeah, they'll get
what's coming to them.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.317
Would you like tea?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.693
I'm fine.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.741
Go. Show him your work.

11:00.578 --> 11:01.912
Again?

11:03.748 --> 11:05.875
That was your worst memory?

11:09.754 --> 11:11.380
Your door will be opened.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.092
Go back to your cell now.
While you still can.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.562
What is your name,
by the way?

11:30.441 --> 11:31.776
Eugene Root.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.615
Welcome to hell, Eugene.

11:55.591 --> 12:00.513
<i>We danced in the moonlight</i>

12:00.971 --> 12:04.308
<i>Held hands in the park</i>

12:04.683 --> 12:06.560
<i>It's a miracle</i>

12:06.769 --> 12:10.898
<i>Moment of love</i>

12:11.148 --> 12:12.525
No!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.235
No!

12:14.735 --> 12:16.195
No!

12:24.662 --> 12:26.122
I'm sorry.

12:36.507 --> 12:37.508
Here.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.349
No more crying, okay?

12:48.853 --> 12:50.729
'Cause crying
isn't gonna fix this.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.526
I brought you in.

12:56.527 --> 12:57.778
I trusted you,

12:59.196 --> 13:00.948
made you a part of my family.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.164
And in return,
you made a fool out of me.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.498
I'm sorry.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.544
I don't know
what else to say.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.963
Well, you better
think of something,

13:17.548 --> 13:19.633
'cause "sorry" isn't
gonna fix this either.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.055
Excuse me, boss.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.475
He's conscious again.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.393
Not sure how
long we'll have him.

13:30.102 --> 13:33.314
Walk around,
clear your head.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.316
And when I ask you again,

13:36.066 --> 13:37.818
give me a better answer.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.625
Hey, Tulip.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.086
Hey, Pat.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.478
<i>You've forgotten us, haven't you?</i>

14:13.187 --> 14:16.190
<i>You moved on
and your life continued.</i>

14:16.273 --> 14:17.983
<i>But others weren't so lucky.</i>

14:18.067 --> 14:22.738
<i>The waters went down,
but the pain rose, the grief continued...</i>

14:22.821 --> 14:26.909
I lost my house,
my clothes, everything.

14:27.618 --> 14:30.037
I asked the Federal
Government for help...

14:31.288 --> 14:32.831
But you know how that goes.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.628
<i>I lost my restaurant.</i>

14:38.921 --> 14:42.299
<i>Made the best ribs
in all of New Orleans. People would travel...</i>

14:42.383 --> 14:43.384
What is this?

14:43.759 --> 14:44.927
Infomercial.

14:45.761 --> 14:46.762
No Tulip?

14:48.556 --> 14:50.015
She hasn't called you?

14:50.099 --> 14:52.226
Why would I ask
if she's here if she'd called?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.478
Yeah, no.

14:54.562 --> 14:55.563
Uh...

14:55.980 --> 14:57.982
Right, that'd just
be weird.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.401
Uh...

15:00.859 --> 15:02.736
Denis. Denis.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.990
Padre. Padre, Denis.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.908
Thank you
for letting us stay.

15:08.701 --> 15:09.743
It's a beautiful place.

15:20.838 --> 15:21.880
Everything okay?

15:22.131 --> 15:24.008
Yeah, it's just...
That's just French.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.179
Right.

15:30.014 --> 15:31.640
Grab something to
eat and then we'll go.

15:32.016 --> 15:34.184
Wait... What?
Where are we going?

15:35.561 --> 15:38.606
Jazz clubs.
Still got 137 more to see.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.399
Yeah, but what
about Tulip?

15:40.482 --> 15:41.483
What about her?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.111
Are you not
wondering where she is?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.237
I know exactly
where she is.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.530
You do?

15:47.031 --> 15:48.282
We're in a fight.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.993
So she's out somewhere
being mad at me.

15:51.452 --> 15:53.329
- Being mad at you?
- Yeah.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.664
Shopping, shoplifting.
Cheating at cards.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.083
- Calling off marriages.
- Yeah, but she...

15:58.167 --> 16:00.002
She never said anything
like that to me, though.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.712
She just
got up and left without saying a word.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.880
- Do you know what I mean?
- Right.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.548
'Cause we're in a fight.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.009
- But I...
- Anyway.

16:07.343 --> 16:08.802
This woman last night,

16:09.345 --> 16:11.472
she told me about
some secret organization

16:11.555 --> 16:13.432
with designs on
world domination? You know about that?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.142
Yeah. Sure,
which one is it?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.519
ZOG, Rosicrucians,
Reptilians.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.313
Secret society
of alien lizards.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.648
They impersonate
celebrities

16:20.731 --> 16:24.026
in an attempt to
take over the planet through popular culture.

16:25.069 --> 16:26.403
- Is that it?
- No.

16:26.487 --> 16:27.988
Right.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.783
The one I was told about
the guys were wearing white suits.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.494
- Yeah?
- They drive white vans.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.914
Maybe some sort of
religious organization.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.248
White suits?

16:38.332 --> 16:41.043
I don't know about that,
Padre. It sounds pretty fake to me.

16:41.919 --> 16:42.920
Hmm...

16:44.630 --> 16:45.756
White vans...

16:59.186 --> 17:00.312
In position.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.443
<i>We're living under a bridge,</i>

17:06.527 --> 17:09.655
<i>and I work three jobs
just to keep a tarp over our heads.</i>

17:10.280 --> 17:11.949
<i>I used to go
to prostitutes.</i>

17:12.366 --> 17:13.742
<i>Now I am one.</i>

17:14.535 --> 17:17.913
<i>I thought things couldn't get
worse than a Category 5 hurricane.</i>

17:18.205 --> 17:20.541
<i>But for me, Katrina
was just the beginning.</i>

17:20.624 --> 17:23.460
- Oh, my God. Jesse! Jess!
- What is it?

17:23.544 --> 17:25.045
Jesse, come and have a look!

17:25.295 --> 17:26.547
Quick, quick, quick.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.217
It's bloody God from
your church, look! See?

17:30.467 --> 17:31.719
<i>...I lost my insurance,</i>

17:31.802 --> 17:34.304
<i>and now I'm mentally ill.</i>

17:35.305 --> 17:36.974
It's the God from the church.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.601
<i>I still believe
that people are good,</i>

17:39.685 --> 17:43.480
<i>and that's what
helps me sleep at night.</i>

17:47.818 --> 17:49.194
<i>How do you sleep at night?</i>

17:49.695 --> 17:51.655
<i>Hi, I'm Frankie Muniz.</i>

17:52.156 --> 17:55.117
<i>I'm not homeless,
and neither are they.</i>

17:55.617 --> 17:57.578
<i>We're all actors.</i>

17:57.661 --> 17:58.746
<i>But Katrina-related
homelessness is real.</i>

17:58.829 --> 18:00.080
Frankie Muniz, huge talent.

18:00.164 --> 18:01.832
<i>So when it comes
time to give...</i>

18:01.915 --> 18:03.500
<i>What do we say?</i>

18:04.084 --> 18:05.836
<i>Don't forget!</i>

18:07.713 --> 18:09.173
Fake God.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.342
He's an actor.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.095
Fake God is a local actor.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.389
Uh-huh.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.444
It's only this block
that's on the fritz, right?

18:30.527 --> 18:31.779
That's correct.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.910
Bulb's almost brand-new.
So that can't be it.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.620
It has to be electrical.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.205
Could be mechanical.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.041
Could be the fan.
Could be a lot of things.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.296
Did you leave
the room right now?

18:50.130 --> 18:51.131
No.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.350
This going to take a while?

19:02.559 --> 19:03.811
Maybe full reset.

19:06.814 --> 19:08.023
Come with me.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.206
This actor could
answer lots of questions.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.667
- Like what?
- Like why'd they hire him?

19:27.209 --> 19:30.003
Does he look like God?
Does he act like God?

19:30.087 --> 19:32.548
Maybe God hired him.

19:33.549 --> 19:34.550
All right.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.097
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.475
We looked online,
you represent an actor here,

19:44.101 --> 19:47.980
Mark Hairlik? Harelic?
From the Katrina commercials.

19:48.397 --> 19:51.108
<i>Harelik. Do you have
an appointment?</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:52.776
Nope.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.528
<i>All right, coming.</i>

20:05.330 --> 20:06.331
Hey, guys.

20:08.584 --> 20:09.585
How you been?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.301
Hey, Jimmy, you're still
playing with this guy?

20:17.968 --> 20:21.013
He will rob you blind.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.821
Mmm...
Something smells good.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.494
Pete, Nick...

20:45.954 --> 20:46.955
Please.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.791
I know I messed up big time.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.293
We need more salt.

20:58.342 --> 20:59.843
Still no word from Tulip?

21:01.845 --> 21:02.888
It's weird, isn't it?

21:03.180 --> 21:04.181
Mmm.

21:05.557 --> 21:06.892
You're not worried.

21:08.477 --> 21:09.478
That's good.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.605
Why would I be worried?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.023
Well, if I had
a girl like Tulip,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.525
I'd be worried
day and night, mate.

21:15.609 --> 21:19.279
If you had a girl
like Tulip, you'd be wasting your time.

21:19.363 --> 21:21.949
If there's one thing
Tulip O'Hare can do, it's look after herself.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.617
- Hey, guys, Teddy Gunth.
- Yeah.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.371
Sorry about the wait.
It's pilot season, so crazy busy,

21:27.871 --> 21:30.082
but how can I
be of help to you?

21:30.165 --> 21:32.042
You represent
a Mark Harelik?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.543
I do. Huge talent.

21:34.211 --> 21:37.214
Tell me, what exactly
are you looking for?

21:39.257 --> 21:40.634
We're looking
for Mark Harelik.

21:40.717 --> 21:41.969
We have a few
questions for him.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.512
Right, right. Okay,

21:43.595 --> 21:45.639
so I'm hearing tall,
Jewish, right?

21:45.722 --> 21:46.807
Maybe kind of soulful?

21:46.890 --> 21:48.475
You guys definitely
came to the right place.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.227
Um, let me ask you something.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.397
Does it have to
be European white?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.607
Or can it be
maybe Hispanic?

21:55.732 --> 21:57.943
And the only reason
why I ask this, right, is because

21:58.068 --> 21:59.945
I just signed
this Cuban guy.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.489
He's so good.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.657
No, just tell us
where he is.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.410
See, it doesn't really
work that way, boss.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.954
You want access to
a Teddy Gunth client,

22:10.163 --> 22:11.999
you gotta go
through Teddy Gunth.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.543
Now, what is
this project?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.336
It's <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

22:23.844 --> 22:27.222
And are we talking
guest star or something larger?

22:27.305 --> 22:28.306
It's reoccurring.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.183
But there's a chance
he'll get up to series regular

22:30.267 --> 22:31.435
if he's God-like.
You know what I mean?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.400
I want premium cable rate.
Fifteen thousand per episode.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.484
Done.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.028
And per diem,
plus round-trip airfare, first class.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.362
Business.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.239
Nice try. This is HBO.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.700
No one's made of money,
Gunth, all right?

22:46.783 --> 22:48.910
Even Dinklage
flies business. Christ.

22:49.911 --> 22:50.912
- Really.
- Yeah.

22:56.293 --> 22:59.171
- Done.
<i>- Excelente,</i> Gunth.

22:59.463 --> 23:02.382
All right. Now, we need
to arrange a costume fitting immediately.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.217
Where the hell is he?

23:04.301 --> 23:05.594
Who? Harelik? No idea.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.180
What on earth
do you mean, Gunth?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.182
Hold on, hold on.
Let me show you this Cuban guy.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.559
We don't want
the Cuban guy, Gunth. We don't want him.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.978
We want Harelik
or there's no deal here, all right?

23:15.479 --> 23:16.563
I don't know where he is.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.607
For God's sake,
he's ridiculous, this man.

23:19.107 --> 23:22.110
I got him this gig, moment he got it,
never heard from him again.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.737
- The Katrina commercial?
- No.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.239
No, no, no.
That was over a year ago. This was...

23:26.323 --> 23:27.616
This was some
out-of-town understudy thing

23:27.699 --> 23:30.077
for some larger-than-life
type character like...

23:30.827 --> 23:32.079
Like a mob boss,
or an emperor, or something...

23:32.162 --> 23:33.246
Or God.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.331
Yeah, that was it.
It was God.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.626
And who hired him?
Who was behind this?

23:41.171 --> 23:42.798
Who knows?
Voices on a phone, right?

23:42.881 --> 23:43.882
Oh, great.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.470
I'll tell you
this much though, snooty freaking bastards.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.931
Because I remember,
I told him to send me his audition tape,

23:51.014 --> 23:52.682
'cause I wanted it for,
like, his actor reel, right?

23:54.017 --> 23:55.560
They told me to pound sand.

23:56.311 --> 23:58.855
Yeah. Teddy Gunth.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.525
So I told them,
"You listen to me right now.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.277
"You send me his goddamn
audition tape right now

24:04.361 --> 24:06.571
"or I'm gonna have
Screen Actors Guild on you so fast,

24:06.655 --> 24:08.156
"your shoes are gonna curl."
And believe me,

24:08.240 --> 24:09.282
that got their attention.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.743
- They sent it to you? His tape?
- Yeah.

24:11.827 --> 24:14.621
- What's on it?
- Are you crazy? I didn't watch it.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.873
Have you ever seen
an actor's audition? Nobody watches them.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.543
Waste of time.
It's ridiculous. Making me furious.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.128
HBO is gonna hear
about this, Gunth.

24:21.211 --> 24:24.714
- I tell you what...
- This tape? Do you have a copy?

24:28.885 --> 24:30.470
What do you mean, he's gone?

24:30.554 --> 24:31.888
How could that happen?

24:34.141 --> 24:35.559
Who let him out?

24:38.353 --> 24:39.729
Well, someone
better find him

24:39.813 --> 24:41.523
or we'll have to
answer to you know who.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.861
Jesus.

24:53.577 --> 24:56.163
You're new, so here's
a little background.

24:57.205 --> 25:00.083
When this place was initially
conceived and constructed,

25:00.917 --> 25:03.879
no one had any idea
the kind of numbers we'd be getting.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.425
Obviously, we have
issues of overcrowding.

25:09.718 --> 25:12.596
We're underfunded
and sometimes the machine breaks down.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.976
We'll have you back
to your hell soon enough.

25:19.311 --> 25:22.147
Until then I'm gonna
put you in holding with the others.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.150
And this is what you
need to consider...

25:27.444 --> 25:31.698
Lots of first-timers, they get very
excited when their hells break down.

25:31.781 --> 25:36.077
"Let's take a break,
put our feet up, it's vacation time."

25:37.746 --> 25:39.581
You know what
I do with them?

25:40.540 --> 25:41.541
No, ma'am.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.008
I put them in the hole.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.600
You think your
worst memory is bad?

25:59.184 --> 26:01.102
You think that's torture?

26:01.561 --> 26:03.063
We can make it worse.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.652
One more thing.

26:09.861 --> 26:12.030
I've been reviewing
your hell.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.826
You seem like
a nice young man.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.746
Sweet. Kind.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.498
Loyal.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.458
Thank you.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.504
That kind of behavior
will not be tolerated here.

26:27.587 --> 26:28.672
Do you understand?

26:30.340 --> 26:31.341
Yes, ma'am.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.346
This is hell,
act accordingly.

26:41.017 --> 26:42.519
We will be watching.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.494
Hey, Allie.

27:02.706 --> 27:03.748
How you doing?

27:06.584 --> 27:08.420
You got so big, huh?

27:10.755 --> 27:12.757
Those bracelets
are pretty.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.302
You make them?

27:20.015 --> 27:21.891
I hope my father
kills you.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.577
Um...

27:41.619 --> 27:46.082
Mark Harelik.
6'2". Gunth Management.

27:54.549 --> 27:55.675
When you're ready.

27:55.759 --> 27:56.843
Okay.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.678
Um...

28:00.305 --> 28:02.307
Let me just ask...
Is there...

28:02.390 --> 28:03.641
Who am I talking
to in the scene?

28:03.725 --> 28:05.977
'Cause it's not quite
clear from the script.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.103
Could be
the heavenly host

28:07.187 --> 28:09.105
or different angels
calling up from Earth.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.524
Your goal is to reassure
the faithful, et cetera, et cetera.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.985
Okay, all right,
all right. Got it.

28:21.910 --> 28:23.870
Ha!

28:28.625 --> 28:30.585
- Okay.
- Who are you?

28:31.419 --> 28:35.965
I am the alpha
and the omega.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.095
Could I start one more time,
please. I didn't...

28:40.637 --> 28:41.763
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.

28:48.978 --> 28:52.315
<i>I am the alpha
and the omega,</i>

28:52.982 --> 28:55.443
<i>and the bright morning star.</i>

28:56.361 --> 29:00.407
<i>I am the Lord, your God.</i>

29:01.324 --> 29:05.578
<i>My children,
why have you called me?</i>

29:06.204 --> 29:07.455
<i>That was great.</i>

29:08.456 --> 29:10.041
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

29:10.125 --> 29:11.167
<i>Can we move on
to the other scenes?</i>

29:16.047 --> 29:18.174
<i>Let's try the "Empathy
with Sufferers" scene.</i>

29:18.675 --> 29:20.468
<i>"Empathy with Sufferers, "
right.</i>

29:22.011 --> 29:26.224
<i>The Lord your God
has heard your lamentations,</i>

29:26.766 --> 29:28.393
<i>your wailing,</i>

29:29.436 --> 29:31.521
<i>rest well, my child,</i>

29:32.647 --> 29:34.107
<i>your suffering</i>

29:34.983 --> 29:37.193
<i>is my suffering,</i>

29:37.735 --> 29:40.113
<i>I shall soothe your pain</i>

29:40.947 --> 29:43.032
<i>and dry your tears.</i>

29:46.995 --> 29:48.872
<i>Your suffering
is my suffering.</i>

29:49.414 --> 29:50.540
<i>That just kills me.</i>

29:50.832 --> 29:51.791
He's pretty good.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.042
<i>Great. Hold on.</i>

29:54.377 --> 29:56.379
<i>And finally,
your last scene?</i>

29:56.921 --> 29:58.339
<i>"Scary Prophecy."</i>

29:58.423 --> 29:59.632
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

30:02.260 --> 30:04.012
<i>Hear me!</i>

30:05.054 --> 30:08.224
<i>Hear me and tremble</i>

30:08.308 --> 30:11.478
<i>and know the signs
of the world to come!</i>

30:12.562 --> 30:17.233
<i>Look for the changes,
for things impossible.</i>

30:18.026 --> 30:22.280
<i>The dying land,
the falling sky,</i>

30:22.363 --> 30:26.117
<i>the beasts of the field
thrown into confusion.</i>

30:26.910 --> 30:29.579
<i>Look for the days to shorten,</i>

30:29.662 --> 30:32.207
<i>look for the darkness to grow</i>

30:32.290 --> 30:34.876
<i>and look for the wicked</i>

30:34.959 --> 30:39.756
<i>to know my wrath!</i>

30:41.716 --> 30:43.676
<i>Excellent, thank you.</i>

30:43.843 --> 30:46.804
<i>I pushed
that last part, don't you think?</i>

30:47.597 --> 30:50.350
<i>I mean, it's not as scary
if he's trying to be scary,</i>

30:50.433 --> 30:51.518
<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

30:51.601 --> 30:52.936
I agree with that.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.395
<i>You understand
it's an open-ended arrangement?</i>

30:54.479 --> 30:55.730
<i>There's no out-date.</i>

30:55.813 --> 30:57.190
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

30:57.273 --> 30:58.816
<i>And you're
okay with that?</i>

30:58.900 --> 31:04.030
<i>Well... Gosh, I've been
thinking about this for a long time.</i>

31:04.113 --> 31:07.450
<i>Obviously,
it's a big commitment, but...</i>

31:10.411 --> 31:12.539
<i>It's the role of a lifetime.</i>

31:12.622 --> 31:16.125
<i>In that case,
congratulations. You've got the part.</i>

31:18.253 --> 31:19.671
<i>Yes!</i>

31:19.837 --> 31:21.548
Oh!

31:21.756 --> 31:23.007
Holy shite!

31:23.967 --> 31:25.468
They killed him!

31:27.387 --> 31:28.763
They had to.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.349
Only way
to get him to heaven.

31:32.141 --> 31:33.810
All right, so...

31:35.436 --> 31:38.231
God's an expert
crier and he yells a lot.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.275
We kind of
knew that already.

31:40.358 --> 31:41.651
Weird though, right?

31:41.776 --> 31:43.278
If it isn't weird, then they
changed the definition

31:43.361 --> 31:44.445
while I wasn't
bloody looking.

31:44.529 --> 31:45.530
No, no.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.032
We're here.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.494
Fake God was from here.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.331
And other people are
looking for God here.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.041
That's weird.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.835
Right.
I vote we call it a day.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.670
Let's ring Tulip,
see what she's up to.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.381
I feel like
I'm missing something.

32:05.008 --> 32:06.759
Something really obvious.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.345
I'm sure, yeah.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.538
Looking
for a gun, huh?

32:36.706 --> 32:38.583
In the ol' gun
safe maybe?

32:39.375 --> 32:41.711
Yeah, we changed
the combo a month ago.

33:08.363 --> 33:09.739
Hey, Marte.

33:50.488 --> 33:51.823
Let me go.

33:53.449 --> 33:54.492
No.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.161
Let me go, Viktor,

33:57.245 --> 34:00.081
or I swear to God,
I will blow your brains out.

34:00.957 --> 34:02.125
Yeah?

34:03.501 --> 34:04.794
So do it.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.630
Come on,
now's your chance. Do it.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.311
All right, all right,
that's enough.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.816
Want me to have
a crack at her, boss?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.277
No, thank you, Pat.

34:30.695 --> 34:32.321
Leave her to me.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.101
Show me your saggies.
Come on, show me.

35:02.185 --> 35:03.352
Just one time.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.605
Hey!

35:07.857 --> 35:10.193
Speak English. English!

35:11.152 --> 35:12.320
What is wrong with you?

35:12.403 --> 35:13.529
Hello.

35:20.995 --> 35:25.291
How was your chat with
Superintendent Mannering?

35:27.919 --> 35:28.920
Fine.

35:29.212 --> 35:32.048
Fine, was it?
Yeah? Good.

35:34.383 --> 35:37.261
What is the use
of a puzzle book

35:37.345 --> 35:39.305
if all the answers
are filled in?

35:40.181 --> 35:43.142
But I suppose that is
exactly their point,

35:43.226 --> 35:44.560
isn't it?

35:45.895 --> 35:47.980
No rest for the wicked.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.734
You don't seem that bad.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.154
Anymore.

35:56.697 --> 35:57.740
At least to me.

36:03.579 --> 36:04.580
I mean...

36:06.332 --> 36:07.333
Are you?

36:11.504 --> 36:14.465
Am I what, Eugene?

36:18.052 --> 36:19.053
Bad?

36:21.514 --> 36:23.432
Hey, look.
It's New Guy.

36:23.558 --> 36:25.560
And he brought
his anal face!

36:27.103 --> 36:28.354
What're you guys doin'?

36:28.437 --> 36:30.314
Just talking?
Catchin' up?

36:31.107 --> 36:33.150
- Tyler.
- What?

36:33.234 --> 36:35.903
I like talking.
He can talk to me, too.

36:36.654 --> 36:38.406
Say something, like...

36:38.489 --> 36:39.740
Um...

36:39.824 --> 36:40.950
Spaghetti.

36:41.117 --> 36:43.286
Or no, no, no, no.
No, Mississippi!

36:43.494 --> 36:45.830
Say Mississippi.

36:47.957 --> 36:50.293
Come on, ass face,
say Mississippi!

36:52.295 --> 36:54.130
- Say it.
- Stop.

37:01.721 --> 37:02.889
Yeah?

37:03.723 --> 37:05.141
Or what?

37:06.475 --> 37:07.643
Or...

37:10.688 --> 37:12.481
Just don't.

37:16.819 --> 37:18.696
What happened to you,
Hitler?

37:19.822 --> 37:21.866
You used to be Hitler.

37:21.991 --> 37:24.493
What happened to
the <i>Blitzkrieg,</i> and the <i>Sieg Heils?</i>

37:24.660 --> 37:25.870
Remember <i>Sieg Heil?</i>

37:25.953 --> 37:27.455
<i>- Sieg Heil!
- Nein.</i>

37:36.505 --> 37:37.548
Please, Tyler.

37:37.632 --> 37:39.133
Please, Tyler.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.513
Down goes Hitler!

37:45.222 --> 37:47.350
Down goes Hitler!

37:49.435 --> 37:52.939
Come on,
who else wants a piece of some fascist ass?

37:54.357 --> 37:56.525
<i>Sieg Heil!</i>

38:00.780 --> 38:01.781
Hey!

38:02.156 --> 38:03.115
Hey!

38:03.199 --> 38:04.200
Wait!

38:30.101 --> 38:31.102
Sieg!

38:31.352 --> 38:33.145
Heil!

38:34.730 --> 38:37.066
<i>Sieg Heil!</i>

38:42.905 --> 38:43.906
<i>...a long time.</i>

38:43.990 --> 38:45.658
<i>Obviously,
it's a big commitment...</i>

38:45.741 --> 38:47.410
All right,
Jess, can we just...

38:48.869 --> 38:50.454
<i>- It's the role of a lifetime.</i>
- Jess.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.416
<i>In that case,
congratulations. You've got the part.</i>

38:53.791 --> 38:55.251
<i>Yes!</i>

38:56.419 --> 38:58.295
There, see?

38:58.754 --> 39:00.548
Corner of the screen,
you can just make out a hand.

39:00.631 --> 39:02.758
- Jess.
- If I could just magnify that.

39:02.842 --> 39:04.051
I could find out
whose hand it is.

39:04.135 --> 39:06.887
Jesse. Jess, Jess?

39:07.972 --> 39:09.432
What?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.393
- What is it?
- I think Tulip's in trouble.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.978
- I don't know.
- What?

39:15.104 --> 39:16.439
Bollocks! I wasn't
supposed to say, all right?

39:16.522 --> 39:17.982
Supposed to say what?

39:18.065 --> 39:19.191
I've been hinting
all day long

39:19.275 --> 39:20.401
and you just
haven't been listening,

39:20.484 --> 39:21.652
you haven't been
pickin' up on it!

39:21.736 --> 39:24.405
Okay, well, I'm picking up on it now.
What are you talking about?

39:24.488 --> 39:27.199
She told me
she could handle it.

39:27.283 --> 39:30.077
And under no circumstances
am I to tell you, so...

39:30.161 --> 39:31.328
Where is she?

39:31.412 --> 39:33.164
Padre, I want to tell you,
but she made me promise!

39:33.247 --> 39:34.540
Where is she?

39:35.750 --> 39:37.626
The problem is,
I went crazy in high school.

39:37.710 --> 39:39.378
Tried everything
I could get my hands on.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.338
Gel, mousse, powder.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.257
I think my follicles,
they just gave up.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.550
That's a real thing.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.052
The follicles,
they give up?

39:46.135 --> 39:48.429
- Can I help you?
- This Viktor Kruglov's place?

39:48.512 --> 39:50.056
This is private
property, pal. Get lost.

39:50.139 --> 39:51.182
Open the gate.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.894
Sit down. Don't move.

39:55.728 --> 39:56.896
Where's Tulip?

39:56.979 --> 39:58.064
I don't know.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.068
Nobody move.

40:32.973 --> 40:35.267
It happens sometimes.
Heart gives out.

40:37.228 --> 40:39.188
It's an art, not a science.

40:45.361 --> 40:47.488
You're awake. Good.

40:48.531 --> 40:52.034
I don't know what you did
to the guys out there,

40:52.326 --> 40:54.370
but I am definitely curious.

40:56.914 --> 40:58.207
Choices.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.876
Hardest part of the job.

41:04.630 --> 41:08.717
<i>Oh</i>

41:09.552 --> 41:12.388
All right.
Let's get to the bottom of things...

41:12.471 --> 41:14.140
Stop.

41:16.559 --> 41:17.685
Stop.

41:17.768 --> 41:20.563
<i>I bet she never had
a back street guy</i>

41:20.646 --> 41:22.982
<i>I bet her mama
never told her why</i>

41:24.567 --> 41:27.987
<i>I'm gonna try
for an uptown girl</i>

41:28.070 --> 41:32.032
<i>She's been living
in her white bread world</i>

41:32.116 --> 41:35.744
<i>As long as anyone
with hot blood can</i>

41:35.828 --> 41:39.456
<i>And now she's looking
for a downtown man</i>

41:39.540 --> 41:41.125
<i>That's what I am</i>

41:41.500 --> 41:44.336
<i>And when she knows what</i>

41:44.420 --> 41:48.465
<i>She wants from her time</i>

41:48.549 --> 41:51.844
<i>And when she wakes up</i>

41:51.927 --> 41:55.639
<i>And makes up her mind</i>

41:55.723 --> 41:59.727
<i>She'll see I'm not so tough</i>

41:59.810 --> 42:01.478
<i>Just because</i>

42:01.562 --> 42:05.232
<i>I'm in love
with an uptown girl</i>

42:05.316 --> 42:09.028
<i>You know I've seen her
in her uptown world</i>

42:09.111 --> 42:12.781
<i>She's getting tired
of her high class toys</i>

42:12.865 --> 42:16.202
<i>And all her presents
from her uptown boys</i>

42:33.510 --> 42:35.471
<i>Uptown girl</i>

42:35.554 --> 42:38.724
<i>You know I can't afford
to buy her pearls</i>

42:38.807 --> 42:42.728
<i>But maybe someday
when my ship comes in</i>

42:42.811 --> 42:46.232
<i>She'll understand what
kind of guy I've been</i>

42:46.315 --> 42:48.567
<i>And then I'll win</i>

42:48.651 --> 42:51.278
<i>And when she's walking</i>

42:51.362 --> 42:55.699
<i>She's looking so fine</i>

42:55.783 --> 42:58.911
<i>And when she's talking</i>

43:03.707 --> 43:06.585
<i>She'll say I'm not so tough</i>

43:06.669 --> 43:08.295
<i>Just because</i>

43:09.505 --> 43:11.006
Where is she?

43:11.382 --> 43:12.800
Bedroom.

43:28.732 --> 43:30.192
- Jesse...
- Who the hell are you?

43:30.276 --> 43:31.694
Jesse!

43:34.530 --> 43:35.614
It's okay.

43:35.864 --> 43:36.991
Jesse, don't!

43:37.366 --> 43:38.367
Jesse!

43:39.076 --> 43:40.369
Jesse, you can't kill him.

43:44.206 --> 43:45.541
He's my husband.
