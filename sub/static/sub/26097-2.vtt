00:08.008 --> 00:11.637
[Christopher] <i>Mom, how long is your friend</i>
<i>going to be sleeping in my train room?</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:16.183
-There's a 10 a.m. to Santa Fe.
-It's a guest room, Christopher.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.060
And don't be rude.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.311
Ignore him.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.521
He's a pill.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.940
[sighs]

00:23.065 --> 00:26.568
This is the tightest made bed
I've ever felt.

00:26.652 --> 00:30.447
-Were you ever in the military?
-I like to be really wedged in.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.785
-Like I'm buried underground.
-And did you... vacuum the rug?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.328
I got up early.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.373
I also gave the bathroom a teensy scrub.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.877
Hope you don't mind, I put out ingredients
for blueberry-buttermilk coffee cake,

00:43.961 --> 00:45.754
just to get them down
to room temperature.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.838
Marry me. [chuckles]

00:46.922 --> 00:49.841
[deep breath] I really appreciate you
letting us stay here.

00:49.925 --> 00:53.554
And I promise Monkey
and I will be out of your hair soon.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.848
Someone as annoying as Kathy
does not deserve a cat this cute.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.433
-Right!
-I mean, look at her!

00:58.517 --> 01:00.602
-She's such a little cuddle-pud.
-[sighs] Oh!

01:00.936 --> 01:02.521
I cleaned out a drawer for you.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.149
It was mostly handwritten train schedules

01:06.233 --> 01:08.610
and Ziploc bags full
of empty pistachio shells.

01:08.694 --> 01:09.611
[chuckles]

01:09.695 --> 01:12.531
Thanks. I won't need it, I'll be home
before you know it.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.907
You think so?

01:14.283 --> 01:17.619
Yes. I mean, Doug and I
have been through so much.

01:17.703 --> 01:21.123
Twenty-two years of marriage,
it doesn't just end like that, right?

01:21.707 --> 01:24.543
Well, you're welcome to stay here
for as long as you want.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.545
[Christopher] <i>No, she is not.</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:27.713
[sighs]

01:27.796 --> 01:32.050
[Sam] <i>After a female emperor penguin</i>
<i>lays an egg, she immediately goes away,</i>

01:32.843 --> 01:36.847
leaving the male to care for
and warm the egg until it hatches.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.265
Oh, yeah?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.392
[penguins squawk]

01:42.185 --> 01:45.188
-Where's the egg?
-Under the father's tail feathers.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.774
That's a dude? That's cool.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.110
-[shouts] Hey!
-Ketchup.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.446
What are you watching?

01:52.696 --> 01:53.905
[both] Baby penguin cam.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.158
More like baby boring boring.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.911
Hey, looking good, Case.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.455
[Casey] Mmm.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.457
This uniform is so lame.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.500
It's your first day, you excited?

02:06.209 --> 02:10.672
I don't know. Sam, are you sure
you're going to be okay without me?

02:10.756 --> 02:12.466
-[pouring juice]
-Yes, you're so annoying.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.552
I feel like I've adequately prepared him
for the real world.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.596
-Yeah, thanks for that.
-Yeah.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.767
-Knock, knock.
-Mom. And a cat.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.478
What are you doing here?

02:27.939 --> 02:30.609
I just came to see everyone off

02:30.692 --> 02:33.195
on their big first day back,
after the break.

02:35.030 --> 02:39.242
Also, I left a couple things.
Like, I didn't pack any good socks.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.203
We're just getting ready to go.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.705
Fridge is pretty empty.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.750
Maybe I should go by the store
and pick up some supplies.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.794
-I could make dinner.
-We got it.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.881
What about something else that I could do,
dishes or beds.

02:52.964 --> 02:53.965
[Doug] It's all done.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.844
-You don't live here anymore, lady.
-Come on, let's go. We can't be late.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.930
It's the first day. Sam...

03:02.307 --> 03:03.225
Sam?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.060
Sam, honey?

03:05.644 --> 03:07.020
I really missed you.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.357
It's the first night I've ever been
apart from you.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.652
[sniffs]

03:16.530 --> 03:19.574
-You have a cat now?
-Temporarily.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.452
[exhales]

03:22.911 --> 03:25.038
Why do villains always have cats?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.958
[Doug] Come on, we can't be late.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.682
[crows cawing]

03:45.016 --> 03:47.144
[sighs]

03:49.354 --> 03:52.190
-Hey.
-Hi, you're Izzie, right?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.901
I'm Casey. I'm the...

03:55.861 --> 03:59.448
Sorry, you know that.
I'm, like, super nervous.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.783
Oh, I'm the new kid from Newton.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.037
-Look, new kid from Newton.
-Casey is my name, actually.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.915
I'm sure you were hot shit
at your last crappy school, but--

04:08.999 --> 04:11.293
Wow, warm welcome.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.420
They should put you
in the orientation video.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.423
-But I've heard about you.
-Good things?

04:16.506 --> 04:19.342
You punched a girl in the face
and got suspended, so, no.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.888
I've worked my ass off to build this team
and we don't need any drama.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.600
-[tsking] I don't want any drama either.
-Don't care.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.310
Just handle yourself.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.606
Um...

04:32.689 --> 04:35.400
Coach said you were going
to show me around. Is that...

04:36.735 --> 04:39.029
Classes are in there. Good luck.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.157
Okay, thank you. That's super helpful.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.342
[students chattering]

05:00.425 --> 05:04.095
-Hi, Sam, I'm back from Maine.
-Obviously.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.808
You look like Roald Amundsen,
dressed for an expedition.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.893
Without the frostbite and the beard.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.687
-Is that a compliment?
-Of course.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.064
Thank you.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.067
My mom wasn't feeling well
and she gave me her credit card

05:17.150 --> 05:19.611
and I may have gone a little bananas
at the L.L. Bean outlet.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.864
Anyway, um... I did some thinking
while I was away.

05:22.948 --> 05:27.035
The pastoral beauty just really encourages
quiet reflection and...

05:27.786 --> 05:30.121
I'm thinking we should keep things
casual between us.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.581
Okay.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.874
[students chattering]

05:32.958 --> 05:34.209
What does that mean?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.170
Well, my cousin Coco was home
from Skidmore for the holidays,

05:37.254 --> 05:40.173
and she has several casual relationships.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.342
It allows for adult fun,

05:42.425 --> 05:44.594
while...
keeping a focus on what's important,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.346
like her own life and future.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.225
Plus I only have 12 more years to make it
on the <i>Forbes 30 Under 30</i> list, so...

05:50.308 --> 05:53.061
And I was thinking of taking a trip
to Oprah's girls' school...

05:53.144 --> 05:57.190
<i>Sometimes when talking to Paige,</i>
<i>I lose track of what her words mean.</i>

05:57.774 --> 06:01.987
It's like she's a whale
or a dolphin using echolocation.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.238
[breathes]

06:03.321 --> 06:05.240
And I'm a boy speaking English.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.325
[whale song]

06:13.957 --> 06:18.086
-[whale song continues]
-[Sam chuckles]

06:18.253 --> 06:19.087
What?

06:20.088 --> 06:22.340
I was just thinking
about how you're like a whale.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.383
What?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.553
-Echolocation.
-God, Sam, I swear...

06:26.636 --> 06:29.180
sometimes it's like we speak
completely different languages.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.266
-Exactly.
-Anyway, as I was saying...

06:31.349 --> 06:34.978
while things between us
will be totally casual, and no strings...

06:35.770 --> 06:36.897
we can still do this.

06:43.528 --> 06:47.324
[wet kissing]

06:48.158 --> 06:48.992
Good.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.368
I agree.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.661
More of that?

06:52.203 --> 06:54.748
Oh, sorry, no, I have studying to do.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.791
But see? It's casual.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.005
[students chattering]

07:02.631 --> 07:03.715
Sam.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.968
What are you doing?
We can't hold hands. We're not together.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.929
We were just making out.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.555
So?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.100
[students laughing]

07:18.438 --> 07:20.315
Excuse me, do you know where CL172 is?

07:22.484 --> 07:23.985
Awesome. Thank you so much.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.820
[bell jingling]

07:25.946 --> 07:28.114
Really? That's your bell?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.200
[more intense jingling]

07:30.533 --> 07:31.368
I mean...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.745
Step five directly produces ATP

07:33.828 --> 07:38.333
because the substrate link to coenzyme A
is sufficiently energetic to...

07:38.667 --> 07:40.293
-Power the reaction?
-Exactly.

07:40.377 --> 07:44.005
But it also makes something else happen.
The manipulation...

07:44.297 --> 07:46.716
Of the substrate
to produce its original form.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.636
[voice fading away] Now, with step six,
the carbons are finally removed...

07:49.719 --> 07:51.721
-[teacher's voice grows muted]
-[distorted audio]

07:56.351 --> 07:59.187
Is this AP? 'Cause I'm supposed
to be in regular Bio.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.480
This is regular.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.608
Oh, cool. Yeah.
I just never knew I was dumb.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.196
-...chapters seven through 12.
-[Sam] <i>I don't understand this at all.</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:10.907
First, Paige made out with me
in the art room,

08:10.991 --> 08:14.035
but then she wouldn't hold my hand
even though she's the one

08:14.119 --> 08:17.205
who came up with the hand-holding rule
in the first place, months ago.

08:17.956 --> 08:22.377
Tale as old as time, beautiful vixen
using her wiles to scramble your brains.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.045
Yes, they do feel scrambled.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.090
Because you, my man, are in the gray area.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.385
First, you and Paige were hot
and heavy: relationship.

08:30.468 --> 08:34.597
Then you broke her heart and she murdered
that poor penguin: not a relationship.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.268
So she wants to protect herself,
but still finds you really cute, obvi.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.062
And now, you're all up in that gray area.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.275
Is... the gray area a bird or me?

08:45.358 --> 08:49.029
Yes. Okay. Advice incoming. Sit down.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.740
Good. I was hoping for this.
I brought my notebook.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.242
Uhh!

08:56.745 --> 08:58.621
You ready? Here's what you do.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.707
[people chattering]

09:00.874 --> 09:03.084
-Nothing.
-What?

09:03.668 --> 09:06.296
Dude, the gray area is the bomb!

09:06.379 --> 09:10.175
You get all the nookie and none of the
responsibility. Let me put it this way:

09:10.258 --> 09:12.719
What's the reason
you'd never have a dragon as a pet?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.846
-Ahh! So many.
-Exactly.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.183
Where are you going to find the treasure
for it to fall asleep on?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.393
How do you keep it
from burning down your house?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.479
How do you keep it a secret from the FBI,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.732
so they don't take him away, wrap him in
plastic and take away his powers like ET?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.192
[people chattering]

09:27.275 --> 09:31.488
If all those problems just magically
went away, then poof!

09:31.571 --> 09:34.199
You get to pal around
with a dope-ass dragon all day.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.828
-I don't think I'm following.
-The gray area is good.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.041
I don't know. I like rules, I need rules.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.626
Then ask her for the rules.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.922
But for real, how baller would it be
to have a dragon?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.174
-Not very.
-What if it could sing?

09:52.634 --> 09:53.468
Still no.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.472
[drumming]

10:00.767 --> 10:01.684
Hi.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.061
[sighs]

10:03.144 --> 10:05.271
You look tired, Newton. Tough day?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.232
[Casey] No. It's been great.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.192
Find your way around alright?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.152
Yeah.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.323
Actually, this super helpful girl
showed me around, so...

10:16.825 --> 10:19.327
[student] Isn't this place great?
You're gonna love it.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.287
-Are you bulimic?
-No.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.916
Oh, good. I don't need those kind
of influences in my life.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.794
Cool shoes. My mom made me
get new ones for Christmas,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.922
which is dumb 'cause we were in Paris
and the Euro conversion is ridic.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.883
I like when they're old and worn,
like yours.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.846
-Thanks.
-We were in Aspen again. So boring.

10:37.929 --> 10:42.350
My parents are on this kick, they take us
to a European city each year. Exhausting.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.435
What'd you do for break?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.813
Um...

10:46.896 --> 10:48.106
Nothing, really.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.817
Went to Target a couple times.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.779
[girls laugh]

10:54.946 --> 10:56.948
[panting]

10:57.031 --> 10:59.075
Um... I think I'm stretched.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.202
-Is this the path, here?
-Yeah.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.120
Okay.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.458
She's hilarious.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.839
Hi.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.892
Did Mom come back here?

11:23.975 --> 11:24.976
I don't know.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.896
How's the penguin dad doing?

11:28.521 --> 11:32.567
If I had to guess... hungry.
He hasn't eaten in over a week.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.069
I got pizza.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.487
Oh.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.583
[typing on mobile]

11:49.000 --> 11:50.877
[phone chimes]

11:53.129 --> 11:54.672
[typing on mobile]

11:55.173 --> 11:56.549
[Elsa breaths deeply] Damn.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.177
That must have been
one good lasagna you left.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.389
I can't lie, it was pretty impressive.
This is good. I think this is good.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.517
This is good. So what are
you going to wear? I'm thinking,

12:06.601 --> 12:08.811
we accentuate the chestal area.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.438
Want to look at my closet?

12:10.521 --> 12:13.399
-I'm gonna cut bangs.
-What, like now?

12:13.483 --> 12:15.652
I used to have bangs. They looked good.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.238
They were cute. I'm going to do it.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.835
[scissors snip]

12:33.002 --> 12:35.672
-[Casey] I'm quitting.
-[chuckles] No...

12:35.838 --> 12:38.174
-No, you're not.
-I hate it there.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.928
It's only been a day.
Just give it a chance.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.847
No. Come back to Newton.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.642
[whispers] Give up your dreams, Casey.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.018
Maybe I should.

12:49.477 --> 12:53.398
Honestly, the students suck,
the classes suck.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.817
Just a big old ball of suck.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.195
And the school bell sounds
like an elf hitting a tiny triangle.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.991
Which, at first I thought was soothing,
but then it gets really creepy.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.368
Yeah, that would weird me out, too.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.579
And the team captain, Izzie,
hates me for some reason.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.747
I will kill her.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.877
-You're pretty wound up today, aren't you?
-Yeah, it's really hard without you.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.671
-Mm-hmm.
-You balance me.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.840
[ominous ringtone plays]

13:19.465 --> 13:20.883
Ugh! It's my mom.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.345
She's been calling me, all day,
to see how it went.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.888
[grunts] That's cool of her.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.392
No, it's not. Ugh.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.019
She's awful.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.396
-Yeah. Correct.
-We hate her.

13:34.022 --> 13:38.401
Look, I know it's tough for you at school
right now, but you're awesome.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.488
And anybody that gets to know you
loves you, even snooty assholes.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.199
I should probably be worried about

13:45.283 --> 13:48.453
some fancy rich dude
stealing you away from me.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.454
[chuckles]

13:49.579 --> 13:50.747
You probably should.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.831
Yeah.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.042
[sighs]

13:54.459 --> 13:57.378
I mean, you guys can do this,
but I am not leaving.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.340
Okay. [chuckles]

14:01.132 --> 14:04.635
Hey, Sam, don't you think
Casey should come back to Newton?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.263
I actually didn't miss her at all today.
So, no.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.391
Well, that's totally not hurtful at all.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.852
Dad brought pizza.
There's enough for everyone,

14:12.935 --> 14:16.314
but only if all non-family members
only have one slice.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.067
Okay.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.070
[all sigh]

14:23.988 --> 14:26.783
Hey, don't worry about school.
You got this.

14:26.866 --> 14:32.455
And if you don't, you can always come back
to Newton. Go, Owls! Hoot, hoot! [laughs]

14:32.538 --> 14:34.707
What's happening to me?
[chuckles]

14:34.791 --> 14:36.793
[school bell ringing]

14:37.085 --> 14:39.087
[students chattering]

14:40.838 --> 14:44.759
Oh, Sam, good. Which thank you note
for the Dean of Admissions at Bowdoin?

14:44.842 --> 14:48.179
I think the whimsical design says,
"I can think outside the box."

14:48.262 --> 14:51.432
But the flowers say, "I'm traditional
and I can buckle down."

14:52.100 --> 14:54.185
I don't care. Paige...

14:54.268 --> 14:57.855
I need you to clarify the rules
of a casual relationship.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.400
Oh! Um...

15:00.650 --> 15:03.361
I haven't really thought about it, but...

15:03.444 --> 15:05.905
Rule number one: We don't hold hands.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.574
We don't hold books,
we don't hold anything.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.452
Well, except for each other,
when I say that we can.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.704
I don't need you to do anything.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.706
I'm just telling you how I feel.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.711
Okay, we don't discuss feelings,
crushes or finances.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.297
Oh! And our weekends are our own.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.634
If we happen to be eating lunch
together or studying together,

15:26.717 --> 15:30.263
sit across the table from each other,
not side-by-side like the French.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.349
-But we do kiss like the French.
-Got it.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.644
You want to watch the penguin cam with me?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.396
[laughs] Absolutely not.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.816
A shared interest
that involves birth is a minefield,

15:41.899 --> 15:43.401
definitely against the rules.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.861
Okay.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.780
[typing]

15:48.781 --> 15:51.033
But that looks really cute.
Send me the link.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.916
[students chattering]

16:02.670 --> 16:04.672
[phone chimes]

16:11.804 --> 16:14.891
Excuse me? Why is no one in uniform?

16:15.641 --> 16:16.851
Casual dress day.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.645
Great.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.441
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.109
-[chattering]
-May I help you?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.278
Could I get a slice of pizza, please?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.655
Sure thing.
That'll be 23 convenience points.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.699
What's a convenience point?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.117
They're on your Flex card.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.538
Okay, yesterday was my first day
and I brought my lunch.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.041
So, do you take cash?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.626
No. Sorry.

16:42.043 --> 16:46.172
Convenience points only, but there is
a vending machine around the corner.

16:47.089 --> 16:47.965
Great.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.593
Can I help you?

16:51.093 --> 16:53.095
-[sighs]
-[lock rattles]

17:01.562 --> 17:04.357
Try 32-12-17.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.943
[students chattering]

17:13.366 --> 17:15.493
-How did you know?
-Because that's my locker.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.663
Great.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.289
Bad day?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.041
Bad week.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.294
This place is impossible.
The classes are hard.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.088
The toilets are, like, hidden.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.257
What is a convenience point?

17:29.340 --> 17:30.925
What's wrong with real money?

17:31.008 --> 17:34.303
You Clayton people too delicate
to touch actual cash?

17:34.845 --> 17:38.140
I've been surviving off of granola bars
and peanuts I found in my pocket.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.060
Actually, this is a nut-free campus.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.440
[chuckles] Sorry. I think they hide
the bathrooms on purpose.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.818
Sends the message
that we're too fancy to take a dump.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.903
[laughs] I'm Casey.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.364
-Nate.
-It's nice to meet you, Nate.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.576
You're, like, the only...
halfway nice person I've met.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.868
Halfway nice?

17:58.286 --> 18:01.080
-I'm being cautious.
-Well, that's no fun.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.082
-Nate.
-Hey.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.334
I see you met Newton.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.254
I thought your name was Casey.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.505
Bye, Newton.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.217
It is, it's Casey.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.386
It's Casey.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
[school bell]

18:20.266 --> 18:21.475
That's the warning bell.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.561
Okay. Bye.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.274
[door closes]

18:32.778 --> 18:33.821
Hi.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.745
[exhales]

18:41.454 --> 18:42.455
Hey.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.664
Hey.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.333
[sighs]

18:48.628 --> 18:49.754
So...

18:50.338 --> 18:53.758
-Should we order some coffee, or...
-No.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.678
That's a good idea. I had an extra cup
at Luisa's this morning.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.932
She makes this incredible hazelnut blend
and I'm a little, you know...

19:02.016 --> 19:03.267
Too much.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.436
[Doug clearing throat]

19:05.519 --> 19:09.315
Listen, Elsa, you can't just come
by the house whenever you want.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.443
Okay, we need to set some ground rules.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.528
Ground rules?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.072
Yeah.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.908
[unfolding paper]

19:19.241 --> 19:20.618
You wrote them down?

19:20.701 --> 19:23.537
-Yeah, it helps me remember. So?
-Okay.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.122
No...

19:26.624 --> 19:27.667
[clears throat again]

19:27.750 --> 19:30.795
If you want to see the kids
at the house, that's fine,

19:30.878 --> 19:32.838
but I need at least
a couple hours' notice.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.717
Why? So you can hide the body?
[laughs]

19:38.427 --> 19:41.514
I was just wondering
why you need so much time.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.974
[Doug] Only text me in an emergency.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.311
I don't need to be hearing from you
30 times a day.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.563
I think that's an exaggeration.

19:50.815 --> 19:55.111
And assume I have all the household
chores done unless I say otherwise.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.489
Doug, sweetie, you don't have to do
everything by yourself.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.282
Penguin dads do it.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.451
I'll be fine.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.124
Hey, Doug.

20:09.291 --> 20:14.171
I know how hurt you must be.
And what I did is unforgivable.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.798
[deep breath]

20:15.923 --> 20:18.592
But we can work through this.
I know we can.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.344
[clears throat]
Just follow the rules, Elsa,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.680
and we're gonna be fine.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.272
You're not...

20:33.441 --> 20:34.316
What?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.486
What?

20:39.029 --> 20:40.406
[voice breaking] Nothing.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.787
Okay. I gotta go.

20:55.129 --> 20:58.758
Rings go on and then they go off.
It could just be temporary, honey.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.469
At least you have this cute new haircut.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.638
[voice breaking]
He didn't even notice my bangs.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.974
Well, men are dumb.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.560
[phone ringing]

21:09.643 --> 21:10.478
Kathy.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.605
Ugh!

21:13.981 --> 21:15.566
[deep breath]

21:15.649 --> 21:16.567
Hello?

21:16.817 --> 21:21.071
Hey, lady face, so we're back
and I am coming to pick up Monkey.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.365
Put me on speaker.
I want to talk to my gal.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.743
-No.
<i>-Wait, what?</i> [chuckles]

21:26.202 --> 21:28.162
No. You can't have her back.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.372
No, [sobs]

21:30.623 --> 21:32.041
I need her more than you do.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.293
And she needs me.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.758
Okay. She's lost it.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.343
That was awesome.

21:42.927 --> 21:43.886
Yeah?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.682
Oh... Oh.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.811
-Hello again.
-I got a stupid Flex card.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.189
-Can I eat now?
-You sure can.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.400
-In 48 hours.
-What?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.444
There's a holding period. I'm sorry.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.405
But, there is a vending machine
around the corner--

22:03.489 --> 22:04.907
I know that. Yeah.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.538
Oh.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.501
Oh, dear God. [sighs]

22:16.502 --> 22:20.089
-Yup, it's why I got a large.
-Thank you, I will eat this whole thing.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.258
You can have my granola bar and nuts.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.884
[munching]

22:23.968 --> 22:26.470
-48 hour waiting period?
-Yes.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.223
It's easier to get a handgun
than lunch at this place.

22:30.266 --> 22:34.311
You know, it may not feel like it, but
I know the track team's glad you're here.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.398
You're right. It doesn't feel like it.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.568
You should've heard them
after you broke that record.

22:40.776 --> 22:45.072
It's why Izzie is so threatened,
you're faster than her.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.533
[students chattering]

22:47.950 --> 22:50.578
Should you really be saying that
about your girlfriend?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.124
I won't tell if you don't. [laughs]

22:57.585 --> 23:01.255
Yeah, I feel that. Two times a year
I'll wear a pair of my dad's underwear

23:01.338 --> 23:03.757
to remind myself why
I'm not a tighty-whitey guy.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.551
And why he's always so grumpy.

23:05.634 --> 23:09.805
That's why I like Paige.
She doesn't mind when I say weird stuff.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.392
And now that she's explained the rules,
I like the casual relationship

23:13.475 --> 23:15.227
because we still get to make out.

23:15.561 --> 23:20.065
And you get to buzz around other flowers
like the horny little bumblebee you are.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.443
Oh. There's a cutie.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.486
[customers chattering]

23:27.364 --> 23:29.366
[phone rings]

23:30.910 --> 23:33.746
-How does she know?
-That right there is witchy.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.623
She wants me to come over.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.833
You know what that means.
Need a condom?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.210
I carry 12 at all times.
Three in my shoes,

23:40.294 --> 23:45.299
two in my back pocket, several in
my front pocket and one... in your ear.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.135
You walk around with condoms
in your shoes?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.970
It helps my plantar fasciitis.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.097
-Huh.
-[door closes]

23:52.181 --> 23:53.307
Thanks for coming.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.562
Rule number nine:

23:58.646 --> 24:00.606
No kissing hello or goodbye. Remember?

24:00.689 --> 24:02.775
Yeah. Sorry, I just...

24:04.026 --> 24:06.612
I just found out
I got wait-listed for Bowdoin. [sobs]

24:07.196 --> 24:10.658
I've been sad-baking all day,
I already ate, like, six cookies. [cries]

24:11.408 --> 24:13.494
-I feel really rejected.
-Rule number three:

24:13.577 --> 24:16.664
No talking about feelings.
So, where should we make out?

24:16.747 --> 24:17.957
The couch?

24:18.332 --> 24:19.249
Um...

24:21.210 --> 24:23.462
Honestly, I feel pretty bummed.

24:24.046 --> 24:27.800
I mean, can't we just, like...
cuddle and watch a movie?

24:28.384 --> 24:29.593
Is that a joke?

24:29.927 --> 24:33.305
-Rule number four and eleven.
-Sam, forget about the rules.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.975
Okay? How do you feel about me?

24:37.643 --> 24:39.979
I don't know. I don't know how I feel.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.857
-But Julia says that's okay sometimes.
-When did she say that?

24:43.941 --> 24:47.987
Last week, when I went to tell her about
all the stuff happening with my parents.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.031
What do you mean? What... What stuff?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.157
Oh!

24:52.241 --> 24:56.161
My mom cheated on my dad and now
she lives with Christopher and has a cat.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.664
-What?
-I know, cats are the worst.

24:58.747 --> 25:02.584
No. Sam, why wouldn't you tell me
about your parents?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.920
I didn't need to, I told Julia about it.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.922
[exhales]

25:07.006 --> 25:11.593
Okay, Sam, I'm really sorry
and I'm here if you want to talk,

25:11.677 --> 25:15.973
but, I mean, when I got wait-listed
for Bowdoin and, you know,

25:16.056 --> 25:19.560
something bad happened to me,
you're the first person I wanted to tell.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.522
And for... For you,
that person is still Julia.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.983
She's really helpful.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.278
[clicks tongue] I think we need
to end our casual relationship.

25:29.945 --> 25:30.779
What?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.742
But now that I know the rules,
I'm really good at it.

25:34.825 --> 25:35.826
I know you are.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.370
But I guess I'm not.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.877
I got to hand it to you. I never left
a break up with homemade cookies.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.881
She said she wanted them and me
out of her sight.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.799
I get that.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.098
Ooh. Give me one.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.310
What's up?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.562
Paige broke up with me.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.772
Oh...

26:05.397 --> 26:07.149
I didn't know you were back together.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.778
I don't even know if we were.

26:11.904 --> 26:12.738
Hm...

26:14.156 --> 26:16.158
[melancholy pop music plays]

26:16.909 --> 26:18.702
[knocking the door]

26:26.752 --> 26:27.669
Cute bangs.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.004
Thank you.

26:31.215 --> 26:36.136
My little Monkey, I missed you...

26:58.951 --> 27:01.537
[Sam] <i>I know it was just</i>
<i>a casual relationship,</i>

27:01.870 --> 27:05.165
but it was still nice to know
that Paige was there if I needed her.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.459
I'm sorry, Sam.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.462
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

27:13.132 --> 27:13.966
Hey...

27:14.341 --> 27:16.635
do you want to go watch
the penguin cam thing?

27:17.219 --> 27:20.889
Okay. If the wind picked up,
the father might have shifted positions.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.393
That would be crazy.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.480
You're a good kid.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.025
-Shut up.
-Give me 20 bucks, I won't tell anybody.

27:32.109 --> 27:35.904
-Get out of here, you're so stupid.
-[Sam] He's in a different position!

27:35.988 --> 27:37.030
Come look!

27:37.114 --> 27:39.116
[phone chimes]
