00:19.452 --> 00:21.854
¶

00:21.856 --> 00:24.023
(silverware tapping glass)

00:27.794 --> 00:29.962
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:29.964 --> 00:34.166
Welcome to the
american morbidity museum's

00:34.168 --> 00:36.969
Night of discovery.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.705
It is your
insatiable curiosity,

00:39.707 --> 00:42.641
Your unquenchable
quest for knowledge,

00:42.643 --> 00:45.978
And of course your
generous donations

00:45.980 --> 00:48.981
That have made
this evening possible.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.682
All of you.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.018
But I want to acknowledge
one person in particular

00:53.020 --> 00:57.056
Without whom none of us
would be here tonight.

00:58.491 --> 00:59.892
Mr. James martone.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.794
(applause)

01:03.730 --> 01:05.164
Mr. Martone...

01:05.166 --> 01:06.832
Did you think for
a split second

01:06.834 --> 01:08.534
She was gonna
call your name?

01:08.536 --> 01:10.335
(scoffs)
why not?

01:10.337 --> 01:11.336
(chuckles)

01:11.338 --> 01:13.172
I certainly deserve it.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.041
Without me, there wouldn't be
a gala exhibition.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.677
But you and I--
we toil in the dark,

01:18.679 --> 01:21.680
Unrecognized, unappreciated.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.715
But well paid.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.351
Lillian: ...By
presenting an exhibit of

01:26.353 --> 01:29.555
Exquisite human anomalies.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.023
We call it

01:31.025 --> 01:33.492
"modern mutations."

01:40.767 --> 01:42.835
Phocomelia.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.772
(crowd gasps)
in layman's terms,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.373
The illustrated seal boy.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.109
Maggie:
<i>That's a real nice fantasy,</i>

01:50.111 --> 01:52.377
<i>But where are you gonna</i>
<i>get the tanks?</i>

01:52.379 --> 01:56.615
I already got one lined up from
a bankrupt aquarium in wichita.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.884
I put a deposit
on a barn outside of town,

01:58.886 --> 02:02.054
So we'll store the bodies and
the tanks until the time comes.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.223
But I told you, I'm not gonna be
involved with murder.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.391
Oh, no, no.
Accidents happen all the time.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.894
Ugh.
People run away
from the circus, right?

02:08.896 --> 02:10.896
No questions asked.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.931
The key is preserving
the specimens,

02:12.933 --> 02:15.067
Keeping up appearances.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.302
So these freaks are gonna be
beautiful corpses?

02:17.304 --> 02:18.470
How?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.739
Poison? Suffocation?
Drowning?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.107
Yeah. All great ideas.

02:22.109 --> 02:25.110
That's why I got to keep elsa
on the hook.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.913
I have to have access
and the time to finesse it.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.916
And I need you
on the inside to help me.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.419
What's the matter,
you going soft?

02:34.421 --> 02:36.088
No.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.925
Ah. You need to put a little
lead in your loafers, cupcake.

02:39.927 --> 02:44.263
The only thing people in jupiter
hate more than freaks are poofs.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.298
Get rid of the
magazines, stanley.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.033
(sighs)

02:49.435 --> 02:51.436
Done.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.938
Does that mean
you're in?

02:52.940 --> 02:55.440
I'm in.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.609
But since I have
to live with them,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.444
I want an additional
five percent.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.946
(chuckles)

03:00.948 --> 03:02.948
That's my girl.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.184
Always eyes on the prize.

03:07.954 --> 03:12.124
Fraulein elsa's cabinet
of curiosities

03:12.126 --> 03:15.194
Is about to have
a terrible run of bad luck.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.700
(armoire door creaks shut)

04:29.269 --> 04:30.269
(clock chiming)

04:30.271 --> 04:32.537
Dora!

04:32.539 --> 04:35.574
It's quarter past 7:00!

04:35.576 --> 04:38.110
I don't hear the percolator on.

04:43.082 --> 04:47.052
(screaming)

04:47.054 --> 04:48.053
Dandy!

04:48.055 --> 04:49.054
Mother!

04:49.056 --> 04:51.056
Dandy!
Mother!

04:51.058 --> 04:53.125
(yells)
mother!

04:55.561 --> 04:57.896
Someone's broken into our home
and murdered dora.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.233
Oh, god, dandy,
what have you done?! Oh, god!

05:01.235 --> 05:03.068
I'm sorry!
She's a mother!

05:03.070 --> 05:05.237
She was saying
awful things to me!

05:05.239 --> 05:07.939
Just like everything else in
your life, I'm the one who has

05:07.941 --> 05:09.908
To clean it up.
I'll help!

05:09.910 --> 05:12.778
We can dig a hole in the
backyard by the potagerie.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.780
Go to your room
and stay there!

05:14.782 --> 05:17.649
And I don't want to see your
face for the rest of the day!

05:38.104 --> 05:40.072
Stanley:
Miss mars?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.941
You are late, mr. Spencer.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.444
Oh, ah.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.945
My sincere apologies.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.647
I was lost in the
maze of tents.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.649
(whistles)

05:50.651 --> 05:52.651
What an extraordinary
place, a marvel.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.152
And...

05:54.154 --> 05:58.457
The most marvelous is you here

05:58.459 --> 05:59.958
In the flesh.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.927
It's a full house
tonight, you know.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.964
Schnapps?
Hmm.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.967
And please,
get to the point.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.636
The show can't go on
without its star.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.672
Hmm. Well,

06:13.674 --> 06:17.376
As you know, I'm here
from the land of dreams--

06:17.378 --> 06:20.011
Hollywood, california.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.481
And who do you work for?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.816
Is it mgm?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.151
Mm-mm.
No.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.054
Rko? (chuckles)

06:29.056 --> 06:32.491
I work for the biggest
network in television,

06:32.493 --> 06:36.728
Wbn-- the worldwide
broadcasting network.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.731
As I'm sure you're aware,
being a woman of the world,

06:39.733 --> 06:43.068
Tv is the new thing.

06:44.837 --> 06:48.240
I would rather be boiled in oil
than... Be on television.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.909
Huh.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.413
You know, over 40% of
this country's population

06:54.415 --> 06:56.548
Owns a television
set, miss mars.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.551
Tv is the future.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.854
Squeezing the beauty and glamour
of the silver screen

07:02.856 --> 07:05.023
Into that little
black and white box--

07:05.025 --> 07:07.225
This is the future,
mr. Spencer?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.226
(chuckles)

07:08.228 --> 07:10.028
I find it very depressing.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.430
Hmm.

07:11.432 --> 07:15.400
But, miss mars,
imagine yourself

07:15.402 --> 07:17.903
In everyone's living room

07:17.905 --> 07:20.105
At the exact same moment.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.375
Everyone in america listening
to you sing and entertain them.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.377
Your name on the tip

07:25.379 --> 07:27.946
Of everyone's tongue.
My name

07:27.948 --> 07:32.250
Alongside some of type of,
uh, instant coffee or shampoo?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.852
(scoffs) no.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.423
I know for a fact

07:38.425 --> 07:44.296
Motion pictures will never
be replaced by your tv, no.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.898
Motion pictures

07:46.900 --> 07:50.569
Are the expression of our souls,

07:50.571 --> 07:53.905
Our inner dreams and fantasies.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.907
So let me get
this straight.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.478
You'd rather perform in front of
a tent full of rednecks

07:59.480 --> 08:03.415
And forego indoor plumbing
than star in <i>the elsa mars hour.</i>

08:03.417 --> 08:08.320
I would never participate
in what I consider to be

08:08.322 --> 08:13.191
The death... Of art
and civilization.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.929
Well, not everyone
wants the same thing.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.665
I look forward
to seeing your act.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.734
I'm sure it's gonna slay me.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.940
Jimmy:
<i>That's right, folks.</i>

08:28.942 --> 08:30.442
For as long as I can remember,

08:30.444 --> 08:32.777
Uh, I've been known
as lobster boy.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.145
Known as lobster boy.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.615
(drumroll)

08:36.617 --> 08:39.484
For as long as I can remember,
I've been known as lobster boy--

08:39.486 --> 08:41.453
Son of neptune, god of the sea.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.988
But my pincers
don't hold me back.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.957
Watch me juggle.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.692
Whoa. Whoa.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.694
You still
rehearse? Oh.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.329
(laughs)

08:51.331 --> 08:53.164
Yeah.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.634
After all these years,
I still get stage fright.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.136
We haven't had a full house
in as long as I can remember.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.005
Well, that's
because of you.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.373
You're a local hero.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.575
Right now, I want to throw up.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.379
I can take your mind off it.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.815
Let me read your palm.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.150
I'll tell you
your future.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.552
(chuckles)

09:13.554 --> 09:15.987
No, thanks.

09:15.989 --> 09:19.057
Do you want to know
what I think?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.193
You're scared of what I might
say, so you're chickening out.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.664
(laughs)
come on, give me
your hand, stupid.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.899
Aw.
You got nothing
to lose.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.008
There's a shadow here.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.677
A shadow of a man.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.745
He's coming soon.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.415
He'll tell you things,
make you promises.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.050
He's a liar.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.018
Stay away from him.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.687
Wow.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.088
You see all that in my hand?

09:52.191 --> 09:54.025
You need to leave

09:54.027 --> 09:55.760
As soon as
possible; go north.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.062
Maybe new york.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.763
Big apple, huh?

09:58.765 --> 09:59.931
Go now.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.866
What's stopping you?

10:01.868 --> 10:04.035
You're smart,
you're good-looking.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.338
You could do
anything you want.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.942
(clears throat softly)

10:12.878 --> 10:14.779
Anything except that, I guess.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.583
Your future's bright.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.518
I'm just not in it.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.123
Save it for
the paying customers.

10:26.592 --> 10:30.495
I was an idiot to think I had
a chance with a girl like you.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.911
Ethel:
Anybody seen dell?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.813
Full house,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.815
And the damn barker's
nowhere to be found.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.283
I'll look for him.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.919
No, I need you to get the
pinheads ready for the opener.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.988
Jimmy, you go.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.959
No good son of a bitch probably
passed out drunk in his caravan.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.661
(sighs)

11:05.798 --> 11:08.099
Thank you, my good man.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.035
Ah.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.174
Dell, open up!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.510
Come on, dell! We don't
have time for your shit!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.612
Let's go!
(jazz music playing)

11:20.614 --> 11:23.281
Open up!

11:23.283 --> 11:26.685
He ain't here, jimmy.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.653
Well, where is he?
When's he coming back?

11:28.655 --> 11:31.656
Who the hell knows?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.958
Shit.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.795
Come on, get your stuff.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.363
I ain't in the mood, jimmy.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.631
On account of that asshole?

11:39.633 --> 11:42.033
(chuckles)

11:42.035 --> 11:44.002
Look, I know you all think

11:44.004 --> 11:47.505
He ain't nothing
but a bully and a thug,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.974
But you don't know him
like I do.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.843
Yeah, he's a regular boy scout.

11:51.845 --> 11:55.046
I ain't trying to make
no apologies for him.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.882
It's just, we had a good life
for a while.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.051
(chuckles)

12:00.053 --> 12:02.320
I'd always been a freak,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.055
But he made me proud
of who I was.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.324
(sighs)

12:06.326 --> 12:09.327
'cause when
he'd trot me out there,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.996
We were a team.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.900
I'd drop my cloak,
and the crowd would gasp.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.069
(laughs)

12:19.839 --> 12:24.342
Oh, and I never felt
more alive in my life.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.012
Now all I feel is nothing.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.581
Empty.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.016
Maybe he don't
want to be

12:32.018 --> 12:34.085
On my team anymore.

12:49.568 --> 12:50.869
(clicks tongue)

12:50.871 --> 12:53.037
What are you
still doing here?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.440
The whole town's
come out to see you.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.475
Go on, now.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.813
I didn't do anything.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.583
You want to know
who was brave?

13:05.585 --> 13:08.920
Meep.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.422
Sometimes life is just
a bleak pool of despair,

13:11.424 --> 13:13.892
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.426
What do you
know about it?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.629
You ever kill somebody?

13:18.597 --> 13:20.098
I let my pride

13:20.100 --> 13:23.134
And my anger get the best of me.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.071
And now meep's dead
because of me.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.907
And there ain't
nothing I can do

13:28.909 --> 13:31.609
To ever wipe that
off my slate.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.679
I wish I could take it back.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.082
(sniffles)

13:38.084 --> 13:40.084
(crying):
I didn't mean it.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.920
I'm sorry, meep.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.421
It should have been me.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.923
Oh... Oh, hush, now.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.825
It should have been me.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.593
Hush. Shh, shh, shh.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.295
(sobbing): I wasn't
there to protect you.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.497
Come on, come on,
come on.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.766
You're one of the good guys,
jimmy. Huh?

13:54.768 --> 13:56.601
You're good.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.002
Huh?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.003
Uh, no...

14:10.783 --> 14:12.517
(panting)

14:12.519 --> 14:14.686
(moans)

14:15.788 --> 14:18.690
Make me feel something, jimmy.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.693
I want to feel...
Something again.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.894
(panting, moaning)

14:26.966 --> 14:29.300
(moaning loudly)

14:29.302 --> 14:31.302
Desiree: (shrieks)
stop! Stop, stop, stop!

14:31.304 --> 14:32.871
Stop, stop, stop!

14:32.873 --> 14:34.372
(gasping)
shit!

14:34.374 --> 14:35.707
(gasps)

14:35.709 --> 14:37.475
Jimmy:
<i>Help!</i>

14:37.477 --> 14:40.144
Help me!
She needs a doctor!

14:40.146 --> 14:41.980
(gasping)

14:41.982 --> 14:43.982
Amazon eve: Oh, my god,
she's bleeding.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.984
Pepper:
Blood! Blood! Blood!

14:45.986 --> 14:47.352
We need a car.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.653
I got to get her
to a hospital!

14:48.655 --> 14:49.888
All of you, in your places now!

14:49.890 --> 14:51.155
Where's dell?

14:51.157 --> 14:51.990
He's not here.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.524
Go and get up on that stage.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.893
Folks are here to see ya.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.160
I'll handle this.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.729
(drumroll)

14:58.998 --> 15:02.533
(laughter, applause)

15:02.535 --> 15:05.403
Salty and pepper,
ladies and gents!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.874
And now...

15:09.876 --> 15:11.342
For the grand lady herself--

15:11.344 --> 15:15.847
Welcome to the stage
fraulein elsa mars!

15:15.849 --> 15:17.949
(crowd cheering)

15:20.920 --> 15:22.687
¶

15:22.689 --> 15:26.024
¶ it's a god-awful
small affair ¶

15:26.026 --> 15:30.695
¶ to the girl
with the mousy hair ¶

15:30.697 --> 15:34.899
¶ but her mommy
is yelling, "no!" ¶

15:34.901 --> 15:39.103
¶ and her daddy
has told her to go ¶

15:39.105 --> 15:42.073
¶ but her friend
is nowhere to be seen ¶

15:42.075 --> 15:43.441
(distorted, echoing cough)

15:43.443 --> 15:45.877
¶ now she walks
through her sunken dream ¶

15:45.879 --> 15:50.715
(chattering voices echo)
¶ to the seat
with the clearest view ¶

15:50.717 --> 15:52.917
¶ and she's hooked
to the silver screen ¶

15:52.919 --> 15:54.452
(chattering voices echo)

15:54.454 --> 15:57.956
¶ but the film is
a saddening bore ¶

15:57.958 --> 16:02.427
(distorted chatter, laughing)
¶ for she's lived it
ten times or more ¶

16:02.429 --> 16:05.964
¶ she could spit
in the eyes of fools ¶

16:05.966 --> 16:09.233
(distorted chatter continues)
¶ as they ask her
to focus on... ¶

16:09.235 --> 16:12.070
(amplified heartbeat)

16:12.072 --> 16:14.672
(ears ringing)

16:16.442 --> 16:18.076
(amplified heartbeat continues)

16:18.078 --> 16:19.744
(bag crinkling loudly)

16:19.746 --> 16:20.845
(loud crunching)

16:22.948 --> 16:25.984
(amplified heartbeat continues)

16:32.925 --> 16:33.925
(object whooshes)

16:33.927 --> 16:35.126
(echoing thud)

16:35.128 --> 16:38.329
(amplified heartbeat continues)

16:46.271 --> 16:49.774
(amplified heartbeat continues)

16:49.776 --> 16:53.411
(crowd booing loudly, shouting)

17:00.853 --> 17:02.653
Knock, knock.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.756
You wanted to see me?

17:06.692 --> 17:09.360
Yeah.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.130
Tell me more
about this...

17:12.132 --> 17:14.198
Television.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.045
(shudders)
what?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.513
All of a sudden
now you're modest?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.848
Well, I ain't never been
to no doctor before.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.517
(knocking)

17:32.519 --> 17:33.985
Just get up
on the table.

17:33.987 --> 17:35.586
Bonham:
You ready for me?
Uh...

17:36.889 --> 17:39.257
Yeah, uh, she's ready.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.632
Wait. Wait.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.501
You're leaving?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.003
Oh.

17:52.005 --> 17:55.206
No. I can stay if you like.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.742
Vaginal bleeding.
Do you have

17:57.744 --> 17:59.343
Regular menses?

17:59.345 --> 18:01.579
Do you bleed
once a month?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.915
(scoffs) once a month?
Oh, god, no.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.017
Maybe a couple times a year.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.018
But this isn't that.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.386
Tonight I was

18:08.388 --> 18:10.054
Fooling around
with jimmy.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.556
Lobster boy.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.025
I think he pierced a hole
right through me.

18:14.027 --> 18:16.227
Let's take a
look, shall we?

18:16.229 --> 18:17.862
It's okay.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.931
He's gonna take a look.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.899
Lie down.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.869
Gonna take
a look at you.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.604
(gasps)

18:34.079 --> 18:36.214
(gasps loudly)

18:36.216 --> 18:38.249
Shh.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.885
Just try to relax your belly.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.086
Where were you born?

18:42.088 --> 18:45.056
Philadelphia.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.426
The midwife smacked me
on my ass and said,

18:48.428 --> 18:51.796
"congratulations, mary,
you finally got you a boy."

18:51.798 --> 18:53.564
My mother

18:53.566 --> 18:55.266
Was over the moon.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.401
She named me derek,
after her father,

18:57.403 --> 18:59.604
Who was a baseball player.

18:59.606 --> 19:03.441
Thought maybe I'd follow
in his footsteps.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.909
(chuckles softly)

19:04.911 --> 19:07.478
But that all changed
when I turned 12

19:07.480 --> 19:09.647
And started growing these.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.916
Bonham:
Well...

19:11.918 --> 19:13.951
(groans)

19:13.953 --> 19:15.920
Okay, doc.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.788
Don't sugarcoat it.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.991
Well, the midwife
was wrong.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.792
You're not a boy;
you never were.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.595
You probably have an
excess of testosterone.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.998
Your body got confused

19:27.000 --> 19:30.801
And produced more estrogen
to compensate,

19:30.803 --> 19:34.338
Which may account for
your accessory breast.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.174
What about my ding-a-ling?

19:36.176 --> 19:38.943
Um, that is
not a penis.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.945
That is an
enlarged clitoris,

19:40.947 --> 19:43.948
Which I can surgically
reduce if it bothers you.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.450
But either way, physically

19:46.452 --> 19:50.955
And genetically,
you are 100% woman.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.692
Now, the bleeding
that you experienced,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.627
That was a miscarriage,

19:56.629 --> 19:59.864
And I'm sorry to say that
that was about 12 weeks.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.367
Now, there was no
sign of injury,

20:03.369 --> 20:06.070
But the baby was
just not viable.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.307
The baby?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.975
If you wait
a few months,

20:10.977 --> 20:13.311
You and your husband
can try again.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.880
But now I must
be blunt.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.550
At your age, I wouldn't
wait too long.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.591
I could have a baby with dell.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.368
Gloria: Make sure
it's extra deep, gentlemen.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.003
I'm planting a whole slew

20:39.005 --> 20:40.538
Of narcissus
bulbs for spring.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.007
They're divine when arranged
with siberian iris.

20:43.009 --> 20:46.010
Miss gloria, you only need
18 inches for narcissus.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.378
We're already at 12 feet.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.513
They are special bulbs
from holland.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.082
Please do not
question me.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.020
Dandy: The body
will decompose down there

20:56.022 --> 20:59.557
And give life
to these flowers.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.259
In spring,

21:01.261 --> 21:03.761
We will look down at the blanket
of color and say,

21:03.763 --> 21:07.164
"she did not die in vain."

21:09.768 --> 21:11.369
I'm sorry I killed dora, mother.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.537
I hate to have

21:13.539 --> 21:15.072
Put you out like this.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.342
You have the sickness
like your father had before you.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.713
He stifled it
the only way he could.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.216
These mental perversions

21:25.218 --> 21:28.953
Are an affliction
of the extremely affluent.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.056
Cousins marry cousins
to protect the money,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.258
To keep the estates whole.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.627
Inbreeding.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.396
Becomes a right of passage

21:38.398 --> 21:41.899
To have a psychotic or two
in the line.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.136
Jack the ripper was a windsor,
for god's sake.

21:46.405 --> 21:49.073
I wanted to be an actor, mother.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.109
None of this would've happened
if you had let me.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.513
I need to
express myself.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.116
Please, mother, I...

21:59.118 --> 22:01.619
I don't want to
end up like daddy.

22:01.621 --> 22:06.090
Swinging lifeless
on a japanese maple.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.258
I won't have that for you.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.793
But it's 1952.

22:08.795 --> 22:11.128
You can't just go around
picking up vagrants

22:11.130 --> 22:12.430
And killing them.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.098
People are missed.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.500
I'll figure something out.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.179
¶

22:54.139 --> 22:56.474
No, no, no,
ma petite.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.676
There's a smudge.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.877
I have to be perfect.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.212
I have to take
publicity photos

23:01.214 --> 23:03.147
For my new tv show.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.882
I have to be a fantasy.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.350
Yes, miss elsa.

23:06.352 --> 23:10.688
¶ fame, makes man
take things over ¶

23:10.690 --> 23:15.226
¶ fame, what you get

23:15.228 --> 23:16.660

¶ what's your name?

23:41.853 --> 23:44.388
(gasps)

23:44.390 --> 23:46.357
Astonishing.

23:46.359 --> 23:48.526
Isn't it just?

23:48.528 --> 23:52.530
Now, this one seems less
pristine than the other.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.032
Hmm.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.367
That's because

23:56.369 --> 23:58.436
She went first.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.904
Uh, that won't affect

23:59.906 --> 24:01.505
The price, will it?

24:03.909 --> 24:07.445
May I ask, how did they...

24:07.447 --> 24:09.046
Expire?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.214
(clicks tongue)

24:10.216 --> 24:11.549
Would you believe it?

24:11.551 --> 24:13.617
The droopy one
caught a cold.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.053
Stanley:
Ta-da.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.388
Bette:
Pink cupcakes!

24:17.390 --> 24:19.390
Oh!

24:19.392 --> 24:21.792
What a treat.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.960
Well, I thought
we needed something

24:22.962 --> 24:24.061
To celebrate your future.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.297
<i>The tattler twins hour</i>

24:26.299 --> 24:29.400
Is gonna be a smash hit.

24:29.402 --> 24:30.868
Try one.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.504
Did you bake them?

24:35.073 --> 24:37.708
(whistling)

25:04.102 --> 25:06.003
Dot, cupcake.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.074
The whole hour
would be us?

25:11.276 --> 25:12.943
How would we ever learn
enough songs?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.011
Well,

25:14.013 --> 25:15.446
You'd welcome other guests.

25:15.448 --> 25:17.448
Uh, perry como.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.683
Dinah shore.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.953
Oh, I adore
dinah shore.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.955
We were never allowed

25:24.957 --> 25:25.956
To play her records.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.260
Mother said she was high yellow.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.564
(coughing)

25:39.004 --> 25:41.539
Serves you right
for being such a glutton.

25:41.541 --> 25:44.375
(coughing, gasping)

25:49.014 --> 25:50.981
Stanley:
<i>Started out as the sniffles.</i>

25:50.983 --> 25:55.019
<i>Turned into</i>
<i>something much worse.</i>

25:55.021 --> 25:57.321
<i>Pneumonia,</i>
<i>I think the doctor said.</i>

25:57.323 --> 25:58.489
How tragic.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.391
Yeah, right?

26:00.393 --> 26:02.393
Bless their hearts.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.995
Amazing how something
so seemingly innocuous

26:04.997 --> 26:07.364
Can cause such damage.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.832
Dot:
<i>Oh, god.</i>

26:08.834 --> 26:10.501
Oh, I can't hear her.

26:10.503 --> 26:12.169
Oh, it hurts.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.340
Oh, it hurts.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.842
Please, you have to get us
to a hospital.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.046
Oh, my god. Oh...

26:22.048 --> 26:23.747
(crying)

26:23.749 --> 26:24.848
(humming softly)

26:24.850 --> 26:26.050
Oh, my god,
it hurts.

26:26.052 --> 26:30.054
Please, please,
please, please. (crying)

26:30.056 --> 26:32.022
Huh?

26:32.024 --> 26:34.525
Cupcake.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.859
I don't want a cupcake.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.861
(sobs)

26:37.863 --> 26:39.396
Bette, wake up!

26:39.398 --> 26:41.065
Wake up, please,
I beg of you.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.033
Shh, shh, shh.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.702
Please help me.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.204
Please.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.606
Mm... Ow.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.907
(grunts)

26:49.909 --> 26:51.709
Ow. (grunts)

26:51.711 --> 26:54.745
You should've had a cupcake.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.414
They're to die for.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.383
Did you bake them?
With my own two hands.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.385
No cupcakes.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.087
We have to
watch our figure

27:03.089 --> 27:05.289
If we're gonna be
television personalities.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.961
Right.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.631
¶ and nothing coming in.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.275
(grunting)

27:25.277 --> 27:27.478
Dandy: <i>I was destined to be</i>
<i>the greatest actor of all time.</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:30.080
<i>Monty clift? If I had been</i>
<i>in</i> a place in the sun,

27:30.082 --> 27:31.749
<i>George stevens</i>

27:31.751 --> 27:33.651
<i>The walk to the electric chair</i>

27:33.653 --> 27:37.254

<i>They advertise in the back</i>
<i>of the superman comics.</i>

27:39.125 --> 27:41.825
<i>And I practiced acting faces</i>
<i>in front of the mirror--</i>

27:41.827 --> 27:44.461
<i>Sad, happy, moody.</i>

27:44.463 --> 27:46.497
<i>But mother wouldn't let me.</i>
<i>I hate her!</i>

27:46.499 --> 27:49.600
But she can't keep my greatness
<i>in the slips.</i>

27:49.602 --> 27:51.669
One door closes, another opens.

27:52.771 --> 27:55.773
<i>And this body is america,</i>

27:55.775 --> 27:59.109
<i>Strong, violent and full of</i>

27:59.111 --> 28:01.845
<i>My arms will hold them down</i>

28:01.847 --> 28:03.847

<i>When dora died,</i>

<i>The clown was put on earth</i>

28:21.634 --> 28:26.637
<i>To introduce me to</i>

28:26.639 --> 28:28.639
<i>But I am no clown.</i>

28:28.641 --> 28:32.009
<i>I am perfection.</i>

28:32.011 --> 28:34.044
<i>I am greatness.</i>

28:34.046 --> 28:37.848
<i>I am the future,</i>
<i>and the future starts tonight.</i>

"slave to love" playing)

¶ tell her I'll be waiting

28:57.369 --> 29:00.504
¶ in the usual place

29:20.860 --> 29:23.093
Watch it!
Pardon me.

29:25.029 --> 29:27.798
¶ slave to love...

29:28.900 --> 29:31.535
Two brandy alexanders.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.804
Let me see.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.374
Wow.

29:37.376 --> 29:41.044
(chuckles) ah, it's a goddamn
waste you being here.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.946
Your stuff should be
in one of them hot shit

29:42.948 --> 29:45.449
Fort lauderdale
galleries.
Yeah?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.284
Yeah.
Hey, you know,

29:47.286 --> 29:49.219
Some guy was in
here the other day

29:49.221 --> 29:52.222
From los angeles, and he said
they have this big pier

29:52.224 --> 29:54.725
Right out over the ocean
and there are guys there

29:54.727 --> 29:57.394
Doing caricatures for the
tourists for two bucks a pop.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.430
I'm telling you, the west is
where it's all happening now.

30:00.432 --> 30:03.801
You think I'm good
enough to do that?

30:03.803 --> 30:06.804
Did he tell you
he was gonna take you there?

30:06.806 --> 30:08.972
'cause he's lying,
you know.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.475
Just a hound dog salesman

30:11.477 --> 30:13.944
Trying to get his rocks off
when he's away on business.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.979
Whoa. Why-why are you
getting all possessive?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.748
I got to work, right?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.983
'cause you and me
aren't just about work.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.585
I keep telling you,

30:21.587 --> 30:23.253
If you're getting
out of this place,

30:23.255 --> 30:24.755
It's with me.

30:24.757 --> 30:26.924
I'm not getting out.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.926
I like it here.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.094
I make good bread;
murray pays off

30:31.096 --> 30:32.963
The cops so no
one bothers us.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.998
The worst thing that
happens to me is...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.668
A little blood in my shorts
if someone gets a little rough,

30:37.670 --> 30:39.469
Or I get a load
in my hair.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.272
I told you not to talk
about things like that with me!

30:42.274 --> 30:44.007
There are no other guys but me!

30:44.009 --> 30:45.576
Bartender: Hey!
(gun cocks)

30:46.678 --> 30:47.678
We're fine.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.079
It's all right.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.182
(sighs)
look, I'm...

30:52.184 --> 30:54.785
I'm here almost every day.

30:54.787 --> 30:57.487
I skip out on work
sometimes to be with you.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.857
We drink and we talk.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.291
About real life.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.861
You can't tell me
that's all on the clock.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.496
Yeah. We talk.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.131
You tell me stuff, too.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.700
About your wife.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.202
About how you're gonna leave.
Big talk.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.872
Usually lasts until
you finish, and then...

31:14.874 --> 31:16.707
You're out the door
before I can wipe my dick off.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.208
This is hard for me!

31:19.811 --> 31:23.380
I got... I got a lot
of complications.

31:25.483 --> 31:28.151
I've been doing this
my whole life.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.821
But with you,

31:30.823 --> 31:33.357
I'm really gone, andy.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.893
I...

31:35.895 --> 31:37.327
Love you.

31:37.329 --> 31:40.497
Love me?

31:40.499 --> 31:43.066
You've been in town a month.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.670
You know what I don't
get about you, dell?

31:46.672 --> 31:48.872
What do you have to lose?

31:48.874 --> 31:51.074
I mean, most of
the johns in here

31:51.076 --> 31:54.011
Are businessmen,
lawyers, fathers.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.881
No one is inviting you
to join the chamber of commerce.

31:57.883 --> 32:01.251
Who are you hiding out from?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.353
You're already a freak.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.256
And no one knows
I'm one of them.

32:07.692 --> 32:10.761
So what's your play here,
handsome?

32:10.763 --> 32:13.030
Eventually I will leave.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.531
(sighs): Yeah.
But until then,

32:14.533 --> 32:17.367
Let me get you
your own little place.

32:17.369 --> 32:20.370
Not that motel
you're staying in, just...

32:20.372 --> 32:23.073
A-a place with a record player

32:23.075 --> 32:24.608
And good light,
where you can draw.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.877
I don't want you hanging
around this place no more,

32:26.879 --> 32:28.712
Letting these creeps paw at you.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.047
I think you still
love your wife, dell.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.081
I got a heart,
you know?

32:31.083 --> 32:33.383
I do feel things.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.252
When I'm bending
those steel bars

32:35.254 --> 32:37.888
Or I got a stack of three
acrobats standing on my head,

32:37.890 --> 32:41.892
It hurts like hot lead
in my fingers and shoulders.

32:41.894 --> 32:43.260
Most people can't take the pain.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.962
But not me.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.463
The pain don't
define me.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.765
But I still feel it.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.601
Every time I leave this place,
every time I can't go in

32:51.603 --> 32:53.070
Because you're with
some other guy,

32:53.072 --> 32:54.905
Giving yourself
to him even though

32:54.907 --> 32:57.307
I know he doesn't
give two shits about you.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.450
There is nothing worse

33:06.452 --> 33:09.586
Than the hurt of loving someone

33:09.588 --> 33:11.655
You can't have.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.163
Look, dell...

33:21.766 --> 33:23.500
I work here.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.670
This is my office.

33:28.272 --> 33:31.208
When I'm here, I'm working.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.845
You get what I'm saying?

33:41.152 --> 33:43.520
Wait, stay a while.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.589
I'll get the next round.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.029
(sighs)

34:01.305 --> 34:03.640
Hello.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.209
Well, hello, stranger.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.013
What would you like?

34:10.015 --> 34:12.049
Excuse me?

34:12.051 --> 34:13.316
(laughs)

34:13.318 --> 34:14.985
Well, it's a dollar
to sit and talk,

34:14.987 --> 34:16.653
Five for a dance,

34:16.655 --> 34:19.056
Ten to go into
the alley behind the bar

34:19.058 --> 34:21.958
And 20 to take me home.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.904
Bette: He wants to make us
television stars.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.539
I don't understand.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.542
We could have
such a fantastic time,

34:38.544 --> 34:41.278
Singing and dancing
on our own tv show.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.383
Elsa:
I am with your sister, dot.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.585
The opportunity of a lifetime

34:48.587 --> 34:51.054
Presents itself
on a silver platter,

34:51.056 --> 34:52.689
And you hesitate?

34:52.691 --> 34:55.058
I don't know if
he's told you yet,

34:55.060 --> 34:57.360
But he has asked me
to go as well.

34:57.362 --> 35:00.864
Would you be a guest on
the <i>tattler sisters' hour?</i>

35:00.866 --> 35:02.866
Elsa:
(scoffs) hardly.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.368
In addition to having
my own show,

35:05.370 --> 35:08.705
He has asked me to mentor you.

35:08.707 --> 35:09.940
And what could be better?

35:09.942 --> 35:12.542
Because I, more than anyone,

35:12.544 --> 35:14.945
Want the very,
very best for you.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.213
Dot:
<i>I don't trust her.</i>

35:16.215 --> 35:17.614
Elsa:
So...

35:18.883 --> 35:20.951
...Go to bed early tonight.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.053
Get lots of rest.

35:23.055 --> 35:24.554
And in the morning,

35:24.556 --> 35:27.457
I have arranged

35:27.459 --> 35:31.061
For a discreet
private fitting for you

35:31.063 --> 35:34.397
With the best seamstress
in town.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.600
Stars need always

35:36.602 --> 35:39.903
To be fashionable.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.073
Dot:
<i>She's angling for something.</i>

35:43.075 --> 35:44.474
Bette:
<i>Who cares?</i>

35:44.476 --> 35:46.810
<i>I'd love a new hat.</i>

36:03.094 --> 36:06.296
Dell:
Hey, baby.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.931
Where you been?

36:07.933 --> 36:11.101
Been looking all over for you,
worried sick.

36:11.103 --> 36:13.003
Desiree:
Uh-huh.

36:14.939 --> 36:16.006
What's going on?

36:16.008 --> 36:18.608
I had to go to the doctor.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.810
The doctor?

36:20.812 --> 36:21.945
What happened?

36:21.947 --> 36:23.280
Are you all right?

36:23.282 --> 36:26.816
I'm great. Doctor says...

36:26.818 --> 36:29.786
I'm 100% woman.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.955
Turns out
I can even have babies.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.957
It's not too late.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.693
A baby.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.795
(chuckles)

36:38.797 --> 36:40.864
That's great.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.474
Uh-huh.

36:51.476 --> 36:54.978
It was.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.814
Until ethel
told me the truth.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.516
Your daddy had
the lobster hands.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.017
Ethel.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.485
(sighs)

37:02.487 --> 37:04.821
Look, that old whore's
got it out for me.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.990
You can't believe a word
out of that mangy broad.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.826
And my whole life,
I thought I was the freak.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.328
(coughing)

37:11.330 --> 37:15.065
Dirty, vile-- all the things
my mama used to call me.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.700
But it was you, dell.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.001
You're the one

37:18.003 --> 37:20.036
With freak
blood running

37:20.038 --> 37:22.172
All through your veins!

37:22.174 --> 37:26.543
You chickenshit son of a bitch,
you're jimmy's father!

37:26.545 --> 37:28.011
Who gives a shit
about jimmy?!

37:28.013 --> 37:33.516
When I think of all the time
I wasted on your sorry ass,

37:33.518 --> 37:36.052
'cause I thought this jacked up
sham of a marriage

37:36.054 --> 37:39.589
Was all I had,
all that I deserved.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.524
Well, let me
tell you something.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.426
I'm gonna get me
my normal life.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.029
The pretty house,
have me some babies.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.597
But not with you.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.099
Never with you.

37:54.538 --> 37:57.941
Hey, answer me this.

37:57.943 --> 38:02.212
Who's gonna go for a big-dicked,
three-titted woman like you?

38:02.214 --> 38:04.948
Doctor says it's just
extra-large lady parts.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.050
All cosmetic.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.119
He gonna do a
surgery, and poof,

38:09.121 --> 38:13.890
I'll look like any other lady
just walking down the street.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.226
Do you think there's something
better out there for you?

38:16.228 --> 38:18.261
You go on and
do your worst,

38:18.263 --> 38:20.063
'cause once they
change me down there,

38:20.065 --> 38:23.700
I'm gonna be too much
woman for you anyway.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.372
I'm moving
into ethel's caravan.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.479
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

38:51.095 --> 38:53.163
In there?
Mm-hmm.

39:01.138 --> 39:02.939
(chuckles)

39:02.941 --> 39:06.142
Um... How did you find
this place?

39:06.144 --> 39:09.112
It belonged to a
friend of mine.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.847
Charming.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.131
I'm not a fruit.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.600
Okay.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.873
But you didn't pay me
$100 just to talk.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.978
I have a keen idea.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.013
We turn our backs to each other.

39:44.015 --> 39:48.818
You take off your clothes,
and I'll take off mine.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.655
On the count of three,
we turn around.

39:52.657 --> 39:55.492
Whatever magic
happens...

39:55.494 --> 39:57.293
Happens.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.497
(both laugh)

40:00.499 --> 40:02.565
Okay.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.174
You're very handsome.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.577
But you already know that.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.514
Has anyone ever

40:17.516 --> 40:19.916
Painted you before?

40:19.918 --> 40:22.218
I'd like to do you

40:22.220 --> 40:25.422
In oils, cubist style,
like picasso.

40:25.424 --> 40:28.258
Can you shut up now?
I want to make this just right.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.232
Ready?

40:36.234 --> 40:38.435
Yup.

40:38.437 --> 40:42.672
One... Two... Three.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.280
(grunting)

40:58.556 --> 41:00.356
(grunts echoing)

41:03.627 --> 41:05.361
(panting)

41:07.598 --> 41:09.399
(grunts)

41:09.401 --> 41:11.634
(panting)

41:16.574 --> 41:19.075
(coughs)

41:19.077 --> 41:20.743
(gasping)

41:20.745 --> 41:23.580
Why are you still moving?

41:23.582 --> 41:24.914
Help me!

41:24.916 --> 41:26.249
You're supposed
to be dead.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.484
Help me!
Just die!

41:34.492 --> 41:37.260
Dandy: <i>Rule number one</i>
<i>of a good killer:</i>

41:37.262 --> 41:39.028
<i>Make sure</i>
<i>all the evidence is gone.</i>

41:40.598 --> 41:42.699
<i>Start with the limbs.</i>

41:44.935 --> 41:48.004
(sizzling)

41:54.278 --> 41:55.879
(coughing)

41:58.516 --> 42:00.517
How can you be still alive?

42:00.519 --> 42:03.186
(panting)

42:03.188 --> 42:05.021
You're making me feel bad!

42:05.023 --> 42:06.456
Stop it!

42:06.458 --> 42:07.857
Please...

42:07.859 --> 42:09.292
Kill me.

42:09.294 --> 42:11.294
Please kill me.

42:11.296 --> 42:14.063
Ple... Please kill me.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.435
(groaning)
(blade sawing)

42:27.978 --> 42:30.046
(phone ringing)

42:31.882 --> 42:33.983
Hello?

42:33.985 --> 42:35.151
Regina:
Hello, mrs. Mott.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.987
This is regina ross,
dora's daughter.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.556
How are you today?

42:39.558 --> 42:41.357
Fine, fine.
How are you?

42:41.359 --> 42:42.892
I'm wonderful.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.894
I'm really enjoying
my time here

42:44.896 --> 42:46.996
At the barbizon secretary
school in new york city.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.065
I'm learning so much,

42:49.067 --> 42:50.867
And I'm hoping to be
placed in a position

42:50.869 --> 42:52.502
At a law firm as
soon as I graduate.

42:52.504 --> 42:55.004
Quite frankly, I'm completely
overwhelmed, regina.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.906
I'll have to call you back
another time.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.509
Well, I'm-I'm sorry
to hear that, mrs. Mott,

42:59.511 --> 43:01.244
But I'm concerned
about my mother.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.913
She missed
our weekly phone call yesterday.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.882
Is she all right?

43:05.884 --> 43:07.183
Yes, she's fine.

43:07.185 --> 43:10.019
Your mother works
very hard for me, dear.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.021
Right now, she's
at the farm stand

43:12.023 --> 43:14.090
Buying winter squash, and
with the holidays coming up,

43:14.092 --> 43:17.226
I doubt she'll have much time to
call you for a month at least.

43:17.228 --> 43:20.029
You tell my mother to call me
the minute she gets home.

43:20.031 --> 43:20.930
I'll tell her.

43:20.932 --> 43:24.534
Regina,
may I ask you a question?

43:24.536 --> 43:27.103
You played with dandy
when you were a child.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.539
You spent time with us
as a family.

43:29.541 --> 43:31.040
Yes, yes, ma'am, I did.

43:31.042 --> 43:35.078
What are your remembrances
of me as a mother?

43:35.080 --> 43:39.549
I don't remember you
really being with us.

43:39.551 --> 43:41.384
With him.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.720
There were always the nannies,
who quit regularly,

43:43.722 --> 43:44.954
He bit so many of them.

43:44.956 --> 43:47.957
I raised my child
as I was raised.

43:47.959 --> 43:51.260
He called for me once
when he had a raging fever.

43:51.262 --> 43:52.962
I didn't go in his room.

43:52.964 --> 43:56.065
I was afraid I didn't know
how to comfort him.

43:56.067 --> 43:59.402
So I sent his governess in.

43:59.404 --> 44:02.572
(voice breaking):
He never called for me again.

44:02.574 --> 44:04.607
Mrs. Mott?

44:04.609 --> 44:06.776
Mrs. Mott, I-I...

44:06.778 --> 44:08.578
I'm feeling really
uncomfortable,

44:08.580 --> 44:10.446
So I'm going to go now.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.915
Uh, please tell
my mother to call me.

44:12.917 --> 44:14.984
Th-thank you.

44:17.087 --> 44:19.155
Mother?

44:28.932 --> 44:31.267
Miss elsa?

44:31.269 --> 44:33.603
Didn't you say
we were going into town?

44:33.605 --> 44:35.938
That sign back there said
it was to the left.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.107
Trust me, <i>liebchin.</i>

44:38.109 --> 44:40.777
I have got even a better idea.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.478
Bonham:
Mr. Toledo,

44:42.480 --> 44:45.848
I want to say how sorry I am
for your loss.

44:45.850 --> 44:48.484
A miscarriage is always
a bitter disappointment.

44:48.486 --> 44:50.787
Yeah, that's true.

44:50.789 --> 44:54.123
What are you gonna do?
You got to play to win, right?

44:54.125 --> 44:55.491
So you were what,

44:55.493 --> 44:58.995
Some kind of fancy surgeon
up north?

44:58.997 --> 45:00.463
You could say that, I suppose.

45:00.465 --> 45:01.964
What brought you down here?

45:01.966 --> 45:03.700
My wife and I moved down here
to be near

45:03.702 --> 45:06.335
Our daughter and, uh,
her family.

45:06.337 --> 45:08.137
But not to retire.

45:08.139 --> 45:10.873
Semi-retired.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.675
I like to keep busy.

45:12.677 --> 45:14.644
Busy, busy body.

45:14.646 --> 45:15.878
I'm sorry?

45:18.048 --> 45:20.183
I hear you're gonna operate
on my dessi,

45:20.185 --> 45:22.518
Make her
into a bona fide female.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.722
Well, she is a female.

45:25.724 --> 45:29.659
But if a little cosmetic change
makes her feel better,

45:29.661 --> 45:31.894
I don't see the harm.

45:34.998 --> 45:37.333
Do me a favor,
all right, doc?

45:37.335 --> 45:38.835
You keep your hands off my wife,

45:38.837 --> 45:40.837
And I'll keep my hands
off your family.

45:40.839 --> 45:42.839
You got it?!
I'm sorry.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.407
You sure are sorry.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.843
Maybe it's time for you
to retire for real.

45:46.845 --> 45:50.580
Give these magical hands
of yours a little rest!

45:50.582 --> 45:51.748
(bones crack, bonham screaming)

45:51.750 --> 45:53.583
Let's make it a matching set.

45:53.585 --> 45:55.384
Huh?
(bones crack)

45:55.386 --> 45:56.986
(screaming continues)

46:01.024 --> 46:02.725
Try to operate with those.
Now you might

46:02.727 --> 46:04.427
Be thinking about talking
to the police,

46:04.429 --> 46:05.695
But if you talk to them

46:05.697 --> 46:07.597
Or to dessi or anyone else,

46:07.599 --> 46:09.732
I'll pay a visit to those
beautiful little grandkids

46:09.734 --> 46:11.200
Of yours.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.368
Their tiny little fingers,

46:12.370 --> 46:15.438
They'll snap like twigs.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.109
(doorbell rings)

46:29.553 --> 46:33.589
Oh, hello.
What are you doing here?

46:33.591 --> 46:37.293
I have brought you something
I believe you want.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.362
