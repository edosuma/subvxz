00:00.273 --> 00:02.001
Your job is to find out
who's leaking

00:02.074 --> 00:04.372
our laser technology
to the competition.

00:05.778 --> 00:07.268
Would you look at that?

00:07.346 --> 00:08.904
I'm looking.
What are we seeing?

00:08.981 --> 00:10.243
What are you hiding
from me?

00:10.316 --> 00:11.476
I have a personal problem

00:11.550 --> 00:13.745
that will interfere
with my handling this case.

00:15.421 --> 00:17.286
Somebody tried
to kill me last night.

00:17.356 --> 00:18.755
Now, you go after your spy,

00:18.824 --> 00:20.416
and I'll go
after my assailant.

00:25.431 --> 00:27.023
Good Lord!
Hold on, Higgins.

02:11.838 --> 02:13.203
It's open.

02:17.978 --> 02:19.309
It's open!

02:26.653 --> 02:28.314
Higgins,
I said it was open.

02:28.388 --> 02:29.582
Sorry.

02:30.390 --> 02:31.379
I didn't hear you,

02:31.458 --> 02:33.483
and I didn't want to
barge in without knocking.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.994
Why not? That's the way
you usually enter.

02:36.496 --> 02:37.622
Magnum.

02:38.798 --> 02:40.993
I have always been
a stable,

02:41.401 --> 02:43.028
well-adjusted individual.

02:43.103 --> 02:45.901
Organized, of sound thought
and behavior.

02:46.206 --> 02:49.073
Seldom bumped off course,
even on the battlefield.

02:49.142 --> 02:51.042
But today I... Today...

02:55.248 --> 02:57.148
I say, did someone die?

02:57.517 --> 02:58.609
What?

02:58.852 --> 03:00.479
You're almost wearing a suit.

03:00.553 --> 03:02.043
I should think
the only occasion

03:02.122 --> 03:03.987
for which you'd do that
would be a funeral.

03:04.057 --> 03:05.854
I know it's almost a suit,
Higgins.

03:05.925 --> 03:07.950
See, my slacks
are kind of dirty and...

03:08.028 --> 03:09.052
Never mind, Higgins.

03:09.129 --> 03:11.120
What were you saying
about your sound mind?

03:11.197 --> 03:12.892
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

03:12.966 --> 03:14.991
It's just that this,
this telegram...

03:15.068 --> 03:17.468
Well, it's knocked me
for a loop.

03:19.472 --> 03:21.337
What's wrong, Higgins?

03:23.910 --> 03:26.401
The Lady Ashley
is coming to Hawaii.

03:26.479 --> 03:27.741
Next week.

03:27.814 --> 03:29.213
Lady Ashley?

03:29.849 --> 03:31.282
The one you said
was built

03:31.351 --> 03:33.046
like the Prince Albert
Memorial?

03:33.119 --> 03:34.245
Precisely.

03:34.921 --> 03:37.389
Higgins, I should think
you'd be delighted.

03:38.058 --> 03:40.458
Magnum, I'm going to be
very straight with you.

03:40.527 --> 03:44.258
The plain and simple truth is,
I can't bear to see her.

03:44.330 --> 03:45.957
I thought
she was an old flame.

03:46.032 --> 03:48.262
She was my fiancee.
My betrothed.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.131
But it would be
incredibly awkward

03:50.203 --> 03:52.671
after so many years,
decades actually.

03:52.739 --> 03:56.197
What I'm trying to say is,
the last time I saw Penelope,

03:56.276 --> 03:59.336
I was considerably
different looking.

03:59.946 --> 04:01.038
Well, so was she!

04:01.114 --> 04:03.344
You're probably not
the only one who got fat.

04:06.619 --> 04:08.018
Who changed.

04:11.024 --> 04:12.150
No.

04:12.425 --> 04:15.690
I'm sure Penelope is as trim
as the day I left her.

04:18.398 --> 04:21.560
You know, Higgins,
it is absolutely miraculous,

04:22.035 --> 04:23.502
what can be done
in a week.

04:26.339 --> 04:27.363
Miraculous?

04:27.440 --> 04:28.429
Sure.

04:28.508 --> 04:31.238
A concentrated program
of running,

04:31.311 --> 04:33.302
swimming, weights,

04:33.379 --> 04:34.971
body wraps,
Marine exercises.

04:35.048 --> 04:36.242
You know, Higgins,

04:36.449 --> 04:39.646
in one week you could
be looking like...

04:41.087 --> 04:42.247
like...

04:43.957 --> 04:46.585
like the man
you once were.

04:48.728 --> 04:50.889
Do you really think
that's possible, Magnum?

04:50.964 --> 04:52.864
Yes. Absolutely.

04:52.932 --> 04:55.127
Of course, you're gonna need
an instructor.

04:55.201 --> 04:56.498
I mean, if you went into

04:56.569 --> 04:58.969
an extremely rugged physical
conditioning program

04:59.038 --> 05:01.438
without the proper guidance,
I mean, you could...

05:01.508 --> 05:02.736
Name it.

05:02.876 --> 05:04.503
Well, let's see.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.709
That'll be my limo.

05:10.550 --> 05:11.608
Ta.

05:29.869 --> 05:31.200
Magnum.

05:34.507 --> 05:36.202
What's going on?

05:37.143 --> 05:38.303
I'm trying to decide

05:38.378 --> 05:40.278
whether I want
the tennis courts for a year,

05:40.346 --> 05:42.780
or unlimited access
to the wine cellar for two.

05:42.849 --> 05:43.838
In any case,

05:43.917 --> 05:45.680
I don't want anything
entering that body

05:45.752 --> 05:47.982
except pineapple juice
or water till I get back.

05:48.054 --> 05:50.045
And that goes for
cigarettes, too.

05:55.528 --> 05:57.758
And start
sucking in that gut.

06:16.816 --> 06:18.078
<i>Poor Higgins.</i>

06:18.151 --> 06:19.243
<i>The Lady Ashley,</i>

06:19.319 --> 06:21.150
<i>my wearing a suit,</i>
<i>and the limo,</i>

06:21.221 --> 06:23.587
<i>it was all too much</i>
<i>for the little guy.</i>

06:23.656 --> 06:25.146
<i>Of course</i>
<i>I couldn't spend time</i>

06:25.225 --> 06:27.022
<i>enjoying Higgins'</i>
<i>little predicament.</i>

06:27.093 --> 06:28.890
<i>I had one of my own.</i>

06:32.265 --> 06:34.290
Let's see. I know that

06:34.367 --> 06:37.131
you'd all like to hear
that I've caught the spy.

06:38.238 --> 06:41.207
Well, I think
I'm close. Very close.

06:41.941 --> 06:44.739
I've narrowed it down
to someone in marketing.

06:44.811 --> 06:46.836
That's over 200 employees!

06:47.146 --> 06:49.137
Yes, I know. But there's
only a couple of dozen

06:49.215 --> 06:50.876
who have access
to the computer codes,

06:50.950 --> 06:53.111
and whoever is getting
the information out,

06:53.186 --> 06:55.677
is doing it through
the marketing computer.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.552
Oh. Uh, while
we're on the subject,

06:57.624 --> 07:00.184
your entire
computer coding system,

07:00.260 --> 07:02.091
is vulnerable
to outside interdiction,

07:02.161 --> 07:03.458
including accounting.

07:03.529 --> 07:04.860
Accounting?

07:04.931 --> 07:06.899
We've got no problems
with accounting.

07:06.966 --> 07:08.866
Look, your job is
to find out who's leaking

07:08.935 --> 07:10.869
our laser technology
to the competition.

07:10.937 --> 07:13.462
Yes, I know, but
my investigation indicates

07:13.539 --> 07:15.268
that it is
technically possible

07:15.341 --> 07:17.206
for someone to enter
their own program

07:17.277 --> 07:19.973
into the accounting computer
and rip the company off.

07:20.046 --> 07:22.344
I thought our codes
were checked or changed

07:22.415 --> 07:24.713
periodically
to avoid just that.

07:24.918 --> 07:26.977
Well, we have
a computer analyst

07:27.053 --> 07:29.385
check out the entire system
once a month.

07:29.455 --> 07:31.685
In fact, our next check
is due this Wednesday.

07:31.758 --> 07:34.249
Well, I'm just indicating
that that's an area

07:34.327 --> 07:36.522
that could be
a problem in the future.

07:38.097 --> 07:39.758
We appreciate
your warning.

07:39.832 --> 07:41.299
But the bottom line is

07:41.367 --> 07:44.336
you don't have the spy,
isn't that it, Mr. Magnum?

07:57.216 --> 07:59.081
And don't worry
about Kaapa.

07:59.152 --> 08:00.710
The only way he knows
how to function

08:00.787 --> 08:01.845
is with pressure.

08:01.921 --> 08:03.684
Oh, by the way,
Magnum, uh,

08:03.756 --> 08:05.849
I appreciate your
trying to accommodate

08:05.925 --> 08:08.325
the board's
unspoken dress code.

08:08.394 --> 08:10.521
I don't think I've ever
seen a coat and tie

08:10.596 --> 08:12.063
worn with blue jeans.

08:12.131 --> 08:13.189
Well, sir,

08:13.266 --> 08:15.860
I don't usually operate
in the corporate structure,

08:15.935 --> 08:17.800
and this is about
as close as I could come.

08:17.870 --> 08:18.996
Well, It's a great look.

08:19.072 --> 08:20.437
I wish I could
feel comfortable

08:20.506 --> 08:21.700
in something like that.

08:21.774 --> 08:24.675
Sometimes, I think I was born
in a three-piece suit.

08:26.646 --> 08:28.546
Oh, I'll have a, uh, beer.

08:29.582 --> 08:31.015
Bourbon and soda.

08:36.222 --> 08:37.416
Mr. Randolph,

08:37.457 --> 08:39.618
you seem to have
something you want to say.

08:39.692 --> 08:40.750
Yeah, Magnum,

08:40.827 --> 08:44.058
we've known each other
a while, not... not too well,

08:44.430 --> 08:46.796
but l... I think
we have a good rapport.

08:47.066 --> 08:49.261
I feel comfortable
with you.

08:49.335 --> 08:52.133
That is, as comfortable
as I can feel,

08:52.205 --> 08:55.140
talking about something
like this to anyone.

08:55.208 --> 08:58.177
It's just a real delicate
problem that I need help on.

08:58.978 --> 09:00.809
You're the only one
I know.

09:01.147 --> 09:02.637
Is it the company?

09:02.715 --> 09:04.114
I wish it was.

09:04.317 --> 09:05.443
Thank you.

09:13.993 --> 09:17.019
I think my wife
is having an affair.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.899
What makes you think so?

09:21.968 --> 09:23.697
Well, it's little things.

09:23.770 --> 09:26.000
Ticket stubs to plays
I didn't see.

09:26.773 --> 09:29.298
Matchbooks to restaurants
where I don't eat.

09:30.109 --> 09:33.374
Well, that's hardly incriminating
evidence, Mr. Randolph.

09:33.646 --> 09:36.240
I know. It's... it's more
of a feeling that I have.

09:37.183 --> 09:39.174
I've always trusted Claudia.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.379
But I've always been
a realist, too.

09:41.654 --> 09:43.281
She's very beautiful.

09:43.356 --> 09:45.449
And she's younger
than I am.

09:45.525 --> 09:47.186
Have you ever tried
talking to her?

09:47.260 --> 09:49.888
About what?
My sordid suspicions?

09:50.430 --> 09:53.160
What if I'm wrong?
And l... I pray that I am.

09:54.734 --> 09:57.430
So, you want me
to follow her?

09:58.704 --> 09:59.762
That is

09:59.839 --> 10:02.137
what you're trying to ask me
to do, isn't it, sir?

10:02.208 --> 10:04.199
I don't know what else
to do, Magnum.

10:05.211 --> 10:08.271
I can try to overcome
the feeling that I have,

10:09.015 --> 10:10.107
but if I can't,

10:10.183 --> 10:12.014
she's gonna know
something is wrong.

10:12.318 --> 10:15.082
It's gonna
wear at me and her.

10:15.154 --> 10:16.815
Maybe destroy us.

10:17.590 --> 10:20.388
I don't like to be
suspicious of my wife.

10:20.893 --> 10:23.885
But l... I have to find out.

10:24.897 --> 10:26.865
I have to know for sure.

10:28.801 --> 10:31.770
Please, Magnum.
Will you help me?

10:41.147 --> 10:42.910
<i>I put in</i>
<i>one of the longest days</i>

10:42.982 --> 10:44.745
<i>of my investigative career</i>
<i>in the pursuit</i>

10:44.817 --> 10:47.285
<i>of Mrs. Randolph's lover,</i>
<i>if there was one.</i>

10:47.353 --> 10:49.287
<i>And I came up empty,</i>
<i>which was good.</i>

10:49.355 --> 10:51.687
<i>I hope Mrs. Randolph</i>
<i>kept up her good behavior</i>

10:51.757 --> 10:53.418
<i>for her sake as well as mine.</i>

10:53.493 --> 10:55.120
<i>I needed a rest.</i>

11:45.545 --> 11:47.911
<i>In Hawaii,</i>
<i>the tourists rarely frequent</i>

11:47.980 --> 11:50.073
<i>the watering spas</i>
<i>of the local gentry</i>

11:50.149 --> 11:51.241
<i>and vice versa.</i>

11:51.317 --> 11:53.581
<i>This hotel was strictly</i>
<i>for moneyed tourists,</i>

11:53.653 --> 11:55.143
<i>which meant it was unlikely</i>

11:55.221 --> 11:57.189
<i>Mrs. Randolph would</i>
<i>run into anyone she knew,</i>

11:57.256 --> 11:58.280
<i>which means...</i>

11:58.357 --> 12:00.825
<i>hell, you know what that means</i>
<i>as well as I do.</i>

12:46.905 --> 12:48.338
16.

12:54.913 --> 12:56.312
17.

13:03.087 --> 13:04.577
Magnum, please.

13:04.656 --> 13:06.590
18. No. No.

13:08.126 --> 13:09.457
I can't go on.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.154
Come on, Higgins.

13:12.864 --> 13:13.990
18.

13:14.065 --> 13:15.589
We already did 18.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.430
Oh. Okay, one more.

13:19.737 --> 13:22.672
And 20.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.332
Ah! That's great, Higgins.

13:24.409 --> 13:26.604
Look, tomorrow
we'll move it up to 30.

13:26.678 --> 13:27.770
30?

13:27.846 --> 13:29.040
Well,
that's the idea.

13:29.113 --> 13:30.375
You do a little more each day

13:30.448 --> 13:32.279
in order to gradually
build yourself up.

13:32.817 --> 13:35.445
From 20 to 30 is gradual?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.886
We don't have
a whole lot of time, Higgins.

13:39.457 --> 13:40.754
Look at it this way.

13:40.825 --> 13:43.020
When Penelope sees
how great you look

13:43.094 --> 13:44.823
after all these years,

13:44.896 --> 13:48.093
all the pain and sweat
and agony will be worth it.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.895
I certainly hope so.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.198
Let me ask you
something personal, Higgins.

13:55.406 --> 13:56.498
What?

13:57.342 --> 13:59.276
I was wondering,
whatever happened

13:59.344 --> 14:01.335
between you
and Penelope anyway?

14:02.847 --> 14:04.075
Well,

14:05.617 --> 14:07.608
shortly after
we were engaged

14:07.685 --> 14:09.585
I entered the service.

14:10.288 --> 14:13.416
One day, I received a piece
of correspondence from her.

14:13.892 --> 14:16.520
A "Dear Jonathan" letter,
as it were.

14:17.128 --> 14:19.062
It seems she wasn't
inclined to wait

14:19.130 --> 14:21.121
for my military stint
to end,

14:21.666 --> 14:24.032
and had taken up
company with a podiatrist.

14:24.102 --> 14:25.262
A foot doctor?

14:25.336 --> 14:26.428
Yes.

14:26.671 --> 14:28.468
He was treating
her bunions.

14:29.107 --> 14:30.472
I was away.

14:31.242 --> 14:33.301
One thing naturally led
to another.

14:35.513 --> 14:36.775
Well,

14:36.981 --> 14:38.778
let's get on with it.

14:40.652 --> 14:43.587
As you pointed out,
we haven't much time.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.418
You're gonna have to
carry on without me

14:45.490 --> 14:47.822
for a little while, Higgins.
I promised Charlie Doyle

14:47.892 --> 14:49.985
that I'd help him out
on a case this afternoon.

14:50.061 --> 14:51.858
Charlie Doyle?
That sleazy mole

14:51.930 --> 14:54.455
who tries to pass himself off
as a private investigator?

14:54.532 --> 14:56.523
Come on, Higgins,
Charlie's okay.

14:56.601 --> 14:59.126
He just gets himself in
weird situations, that's all.

14:59.203 --> 15:00.397
What's he want you
to do now?

15:00.471 --> 15:01.597
Help him find a hit man?

15:01.673 --> 15:03.834
Well, actually,
that might've been easier.

15:03.908 --> 15:05.899
See, he was hired
to follow this guy's wife

15:05.977 --> 15:07.968
in order to find out
who her lover was.

15:08.046 --> 15:09.172
And when he did,

15:09.247 --> 15:11.738
that lover turned out
to be Charlie's best friend.

15:12.684 --> 15:13.776
Hmm.

15:14.152 --> 15:15.983
Well, it is a bit sticky.

15:16.054 --> 15:17.544
One's first inclination
usually

15:17.622 --> 15:19.055
is to have a talk
with the friend.

15:19.123 --> 15:20.613
But of course
he can't do that.

15:20.692 --> 15:22.819
Of course. Why not?

15:22.894 --> 15:25.089
Oh, come now,
Magnum, it's unethical.

15:25.163 --> 15:27.324
It's a breach
of client confidentiality.

15:27.398 --> 15:28.524
Besides, it's not his place

15:28.600 --> 15:30.329
to hand out
unsolicited opinions

15:30.401 --> 15:32.733
friend or no friend,
don't you agree?

15:32.804 --> 15:35.170
Yeah. That's what
I told Charlie.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.374
And what did he do?

15:37.842 --> 15:38.900
Quit?

15:38.977 --> 15:41.138
Well, what's the problem?
Is it the money?

15:41.212 --> 15:42.941
No, sir,
the money is fine.

15:43.014 --> 15:44.038
As a matter of fact,

15:44.115 --> 15:45.742
I'm returning the advance
you gave me.

15:45.817 --> 15:47.375
Why can't you
stay on the case?

15:47.452 --> 15:49.886
Well, I've... I've got a
personal problem to take care of,

15:49.954 --> 15:52.514
and the case wouldn't get
my full attention.

15:52.590 --> 15:53.716
Now, look,

15:53.791 --> 15:55.691
take care
of the personal matter,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.751
and then continue
on the case.

15:57.829 --> 15:59.490
I don't think
that would work.

16:00.231 --> 16:01.994
You found out
something about Claudia.

16:02.066 --> 16:03.624
She's seeing somebody,
right?

16:03.701 --> 16:05.032
Mr. Randolph, please

16:05.103 --> 16:07.571
just hire yourself
another private investigator.

16:07.639 --> 16:10.107
You realize what
you're doing to me, Magnum?

16:10.174 --> 16:11.903
I told you how difficult
it was for me

16:11.976 --> 16:13.637
to hire
a private investigator.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.440
Now you tell me
to look for another one.

16:15.513 --> 16:17.140
I don't think
that's very fair.

16:17.215 --> 16:18.512
I'm really sorry, sir.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.448
Come on, now,
what are you hiding from me?

16:20.518 --> 16:21.507
Mr. Randolph,

16:21.586 --> 16:23.178
I really do have
a personal problem,

16:23.254 --> 16:25.654
that will interfere
with my handling this case!

16:26.324 --> 16:28.155
All right. All right.
I'm sorry.

16:28.226 --> 16:30.023
L... I shouldn't
push you like that.

16:30.094 --> 16:32.858
Is there anything I can do
to make you change your mind?

16:33.464 --> 16:34.692
No, sir.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.559
You know the board

16:37.635 --> 16:39.626
is going to be
very disappointed, too.

16:39.704 --> 16:41.934
Well, sir. It seems to me
it's just a matter

16:42.006 --> 16:43.769
of watching those people
in marketing,

16:43.841 --> 16:45.706
who have access to the code.

16:45.777 --> 16:47.404
Just about any
private investigator

16:47.478 --> 16:48.809
can do that for you.

16:50.348 --> 16:52.111
I don't know what to say.

16:53.084 --> 16:54.711
I'm really sorry,
Mr. Randolph.

16:54.786 --> 16:56.276
L... I wouldn't do this to you

16:56.354 --> 16:58.413
unless it were
absolutely necessary.

16:58.489 --> 17:00.286
I know that, Thomas.

17:01.159 --> 17:02.683
Thank you, sir.

17:17.541 --> 17:19.532
Hey, Rick,
why don't we get T.C.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.009
And go out
for a big steak dinner?

17:21.079 --> 17:23.104
You know at that place
you're always talking about?

17:23.181 --> 17:24.910
The one on the other
side of the island.

17:24.982 --> 17:26.381
They import their beef
from Texas?

17:26.451 --> 17:27.577
The Stockyard.
Yeah.

17:27.652 --> 17:29.779
No. I can't,
but you and T.C. Go ahead.

17:30.088 --> 17:31.646
Don't you get off
pretty soon?

17:31.723 --> 17:32.849
Yeah.

17:33.057 --> 17:35.025
Okay. Well, we don't
have to have a steak.

17:35.093 --> 17:37.891
Why don't we go to that place
that's near your old club?

17:37.962 --> 17:39.224
You always
liked that a lot.

17:39.297 --> 17:41.788
No, I'm sorry, Thomas.
I already made other plans.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.632
Other plans?

17:44.035 --> 17:46.401
Yeah. You know,
believe it or not,

17:46.471 --> 17:48.598
I do have a life
outside of this club.

17:48.673 --> 17:51.005
Yeah? Where you going?

17:51.075 --> 17:52.133
Out.

17:52.210 --> 17:53.268
Alone?

17:53.344 --> 17:54.606
Thomas,

17:54.679 --> 17:56.374
you're starting to sound
like my mother.

17:56.447 --> 17:58.847
Look, you and T.C. Go out
and have a good time.

18:01.285 --> 18:02.377
And don't worry,

18:02.453 --> 18:04.683
I'll have the car home
by midnight, Mommy.

18:27.578 --> 18:28.772
Hi.

18:30.014 --> 18:31.675
I ordered for you.

18:34.252 --> 18:35.446
To us.

18:43.728 --> 18:45.252
Claudia, what's wrong?

18:46.230 --> 18:47.492
Claudia.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.063
Rick, I can't see you
for a while.

18:50.568 --> 18:51.728
What?

18:51.936 --> 18:54.496
This is all just happening
too fast.

18:54.572 --> 18:57.905
Listen, where I come from
two weeks is not too fast.

18:58.242 --> 18:59.402
Well, it is to me.

18:59.477 --> 19:01.536
Come on. Last night
you were ready to sail off

19:01.612 --> 19:03.045
with me for the weekend!

19:03.114 --> 19:05.173
Rick, that was a fantasy.

19:05.249 --> 19:07.149
Did your husband
find out about us?

19:08.853 --> 19:10.480
I think he suspects.

19:10.555 --> 19:11.920
Great!
What?

19:11.989 --> 19:13.115
Don't you see, Claudia,

19:13.191 --> 19:15.318
this is our chance for us
to come out in the open?

19:15.393 --> 19:17.122
Rick, what are you
talking about?

19:17.195 --> 19:18.355
A divorce.

19:18.429 --> 19:20.727
Now look, you said
you don't love him anymore,

19:20.798 --> 19:22.959
that he never loved you,
he just owned you.

19:25.369 --> 19:27.496
Were those just lies,
Claudia?

19:27.572 --> 19:28.698
No.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.107
Well...

19:32.643 --> 19:35.271
Yes, maybe some of them,
I don't know.

19:37.281 --> 19:38.339
Claudia.

19:38.416 --> 19:41.317
Rick, please,
just listen to me, okay?

19:44.388 --> 19:46.356
This has been wonderful.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.983
And you've been wonderful.

19:49.627 --> 19:51.720
But now that
Jim is suspicious,

19:51.796 --> 19:53.730
it just isn't the same.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.394
God, Rick.
I'm confused. I'm scared.

20:01.539 --> 20:03.700
I may still
love my husband.

20:04.308 --> 20:05.866
May love or do?

20:07.812 --> 20:09.279
I don't know.

20:11.082 --> 20:12.344
But until I find out,

20:12.416 --> 20:14.646
I don't think
we should see each other.

20:16.254 --> 20:17.846
I'm sorry, Rick.

20:20.358 --> 20:21.620
Claudia.

20:21.993 --> 20:23.324
Claudia.

21:01.532 --> 21:04.467
You finally decided
to show up to work, huh?

21:07.138 --> 21:08.628
Hey! What's the matter
with you?

21:08.706 --> 21:09.695
Nothing!

21:09.774 --> 21:11.401
What do you mean,
nothing?

21:11.475 --> 21:14.239
Look, I said nothing, now
just back off of me, will you?

21:14.879 --> 21:16.574
What is wrong
with everyone?

21:16.647 --> 21:19.207
Thomas is sitting there
like his mother just died.

21:19.283 --> 21:21.945
You come driving up
here like a lunatic.

21:22.019 --> 21:25.011
And if anybody should be mad,
it should be me.

21:25.089 --> 21:26.647
Why? What happened
to you now?

21:26.724 --> 21:29.557
Oh, that turkey invited me
to lunch on him.

21:29.961 --> 21:33.021
Said that he was gonna
talk to me

21:33.097 --> 21:35.258
about paying up
some of his old debts.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.595
He was getting paid

21:36.667 --> 21:38.259
by this... this... this
Randolph guy.

21:38.336 --> 21:39.564
I drive all the way...

21:39.637 --> 21:41.434
Wait a minute.
What Randolph guy?

21:43.674 --> 21:45.801
James, yeah,
James Randolph.

21:45.876 --> 21:47.605
Some rich guy
he was working for,

21:47.678 --> 21:49.703
only he's not
working for him anymore.

21:50.948 --> 21:52.813
Rick. Hey, Rick!

21:54.285 --> 21:55.513
Phooey.

22:01.993 --> 22:03.324
Unless you're paying for this,

22:03.394 --> 22:04.691
just don't plan on
finishing it.

22:04.762 --> 22:05.786
What?

22:05.863 --> 22:07.626
You're working
for James Randolph.

22:10.134 --> 22:11.158
Oh, hell.

22:11.235 --> 22:12.896
Ah, hell is right.

22:12.970 --> 22:15.200
Come on, Rick, I'm not
working for him anymore.

22:15.272 --> 22:16.296
Of course not.

22:16.374 --> 22:18.501
The case is over now
that you've told him about me.

22:18.576 --> 22:20.669
Wrong. I quit the case,
I didn't tell Randolph.

22:20.745 --> 22:22.269
Did you get a lot
of cheap thrills

22:22.346 --> 22:24.678
following us around
with your little Instamatic?

22:24.749 --> 22:26.273
Got any 8 x 10s I could buy?

22:26.350 --> 22:27.908
Stop it.
Sure. I'll stop it!

22:30.988 --> 22:32.421
This is a private club.

22:32.490 --> 22:34.185
Unless you've got
membership money, pal,

22:34.258 --> 22:36.419
I suggest you leave.
And leave now.

22:50.307 --> 22:51.604
<i>I knew Rick's behavior</i>

22:51.675 --> 22:54.075
<i>stemmed more from frustration</i>
<i>than it did anger.</i>

22:54.145 --> 22:57.239
<i>But somehow that didn't</i>
<i>make me feel any better.</i>

24:58.784 --> 25:00.115
Hi there, Mr. Magnum.

25:00.186 --> 25:01.244
Hi.

25:02.188 --> 25:04.053
Gate not working today?

25:04.123 --> 25:06.887
No, sir. Your security card
is out-of-date.

25:06.959 --> 25:08.017
Out-of-date?

25:08.094 --> 25:09.118
Yes, sir.

25:09.195 --> 25:11.186
They changed
all the cards and passes.

25:12.398 --> 25:14.423
This electronic device
has been modified

25:14.500 --> 25:16.798
so that any foreign object
or counterfeit card

25:16.869 --> 25:18.860
that passes over
its electronic eye

25:18.938 --> 25:21.031
sets off a buzzer.
It's a good idea.

25:21.107 --> 25:22.301
Yes, I know.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.900
That was a suggestion I made
to the board of directors.

25:24.977 --> 25:26.137
That was your idea?
Yeah.

25:26.212 --> 25:27.839
It's a darn good one.
Congratulations.

25:27.913 --> 25:29.278
Thank you.

25:30.883 --> 25:32.407
Aren't you gonna
let me in the gate?

25:32.485 --> 25:34.248
Well, I can't, sir.
Why not?

25:34.320 --> 25:36.254
Because your security pass
is out-of-date.

25:36.322 --> 25:37.755
I just told you.

25:37.890 --> 25:39.050
I see. Well,

25:39.125 --> 25:41.559
where can I go to get
an up-to-date security pass?

25:41.627 --> 25:42.685
Third floor.

25:42.762 --> 25:44.627
Third floor. Thank you.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.156
But you're not going to let me
go to the third floor

25:48.234 --> 25:50.498
because my security card
is out-of-date.

25:50.603 --> 25:52.798
I just follow
the rules, sir.

25:54.106 --> 25:56.074
Okay. Let me ask you this.

25:56.142 --> 25:57.666
Could you at least
call Mr. Randolph

25:57.743 --> 25:59.074
and tell him I'm here?

25:59.145 --> 26:00.203
That I can do.

26:00.279 --> 26:01.303
Thank you.

26:09.121 --> 26:10.486
Here you go.

26:12.391 --> 26:13.824
Ah, Thomas,

26:14.360 --> 26:16.487
what brings you
back to the company?

26:16.562 --> 26:18.154
Well, I just thought
I'd stop by

26:18.230 --> 26:20.790
and see if you were taking
any of my advice on security.

26:20.866 --> 26:22.629
I'm sorry about
the inconvenience,

26:22.702 --> 26:24.533
but at least we know
that your suggestions

26:24.603 --> 26:25.831
have proven effective.

26:25.905 --> 26:27.304
Let me ask you something,

26:27.373 --> 26:29.307
does everybody know
I'm off this case?

26:29.375 --> 26:31.343
Not yet. I haven't made
a formal announcement

26:31.410 --> 26:32.399
to the board.

26:32.478 --> 26:35.242
I have hired another man
to finish the investigation.

26:35.948 --> 26:37.506
Thomas Magnum,

26:37.583 --> 26:41.212
this is, uh, J. Weston Reese,
Investigating Consultant.

26:41.287 --> 26:42.948
How do you do?
Mr. Magnum.

26:43.022 --> 26:45.252
I read through your evaluation
and I found it sound.

26:45.324 --> 26:46.348
Very sound.

26:46.425 --> 26:47.414
Thank you.

26:47.493 --> 26:48.517
I hope you don't mind

26:48.594 --> 26:50.562
if I disagree with you
on one point, though.

26:51.330 --> 26:54.094
The hypothesis that
our spy is in marketing.

26:54.667 --> 26:57.329
You see, after
we reevaluated your data

26:57.403 --> 26:58.802
through our computer,

26:58.871 --> 27:01.806
of course after my own
personal investigation,

27:01.874 --> 27:05.071
l... I think the person we're
after might be in R and D.

27:05.144 --> 27:07.339
Well, I think
the person we're after

27:07.413 --> 27:09.540
drives a gray sedan
and tried to kill me.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.009
What are you
talking about?

27:13.085 --> 27:15.383
Somebody tried very hard
to run me over.

27:15.454 --> 27:17.149
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

27:17.656 --> 27:19.351
Why would you assume that

27:19.425 --> 27:21.393
there's necessarily
a correlation?

27:21.460 --> 27:24.122
Well, I may not have your
nifty computer, Mr. Reese,

27:24.196 --> 27:26.323
but I've got pretty
terrific intuition.

27:26.398 --> 27:27.387
And it tells me

27:27.466 --> 27:29.400
I was getting very close
to finding our spy.

27:29.468 --> 27:30.958
Hmm. Perhaps.

27:31.170 --> 27:33.570
Could it be possible
that this attack on you

27:33.639 --> 27:35.539
might stem from
one of your other case?

27:36.475 --> 27:38.636
I'm not on any other cases.

27:38.844 --> 27:41.438
Thomas, uh, let me get
a memo off immediately

27:41.514 --> 27:42.913
to everyone in the company,

27:42.982 --> 27:44.745
that you're no longer
working for us.

27:44.817 --> 27:46.785
Well, I appreciate that,
but in the meantime,

27:46.852 --> 27:47.841
I hope you don't mind

27:47.920 --> 27:49.683
if I conduct
my own investigation.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.188
Mr. Magnum,

27:52.925 --> 27:55.655
I've been retained to solve
this security leak.

27:55.728 --> 27:57.923
My firm doesn't take
freelance partners.

27:59.665 --> 28:00.859
You know,
I'm not looking

28:00.933 --> 28:02.730
to play a duet with you,
Mr. Reese,

28:02.802 --> 28:04.064
but somebody
tried to kill me.

28:04.136 --> 28:05.364
Now, you go after your spy,

28:05.437 --> 28:07.132
and I'll go
after my assailant.

28:07.206 --> 28:08.537
But don't be surprised

28:08.607 --> 28:10.768
if it ends up to be
the same person, okay?

28:11.410 --> 28:12.877
Mr. Randolph.

28:17.349 --> 28:18.714
Uh, Donna?

28:18.851 --> 28:21.843
Uh, get off a memo
to all heads of department,

28:21.921 --> 28:23.912
that, uh, Thomas Magnum
is no longer...

28:23.989 --> 28:24.978
No! No!

28:25.057 --> 28:26.649
Uh, hold on, Donna.
What is it?

28:26.725 --> 28:28.158
That's counterproductive.

28:28.227 --> 28:30.195
If our spy is truly out
to get Magnum,

28:30.262 --> 28:31.490
then he's panicking.

28:31.564 --> 28:33.657
There' s a good chance,
he's gonna show his hand.

28:33.732 --> 28:34.790
Wait a minute.

28:34.867 --> 28:37.358
We only need a day or two.
We'll take precautions.

28:39.205 --> 28:40.638
Mr. Randolph,

28:40.840 --> 28:43.604
you are paying me
a lot of money for my advice.

28:44.210 --> 28:46.269
Don't you think
you ought to take it?

28:48.547 --> 28:50.845
Donna, forget that memo.

28:59.692 --> 29:01.284
Oh, hey, thanks.

29:07.199 --> 29:09.463
Hey, man, are my eyes
playing tricks on me?

29:09.535 --> 29:11.002
No, that's Higgins.

29:11.070 --> 29:13.300
You should've seen him
this morning on a surf ski.

29:13.372 --> 29:14.430
What's wrong with him?

29:14.506 --> 29:16.406
He's on some kind
of shaping up kick.

29:16.475 --> 29:18.375
He's got an old flame
coming to see him.

29:21.714 --> 29:24.239
Hi, Rick. How did I do?

29:25.618 --> 29:27.347
Seven minutes,
right on the nose.

29:27.419 --> 29:29.614
He runs a 7-minute mile?

29:29.688 --> 29:31.519
No. A 7-minute beach.

29:33.726 --> 29:35.887
Hey, Higgins,
when is Mama coming in?

29:36.629 --> 29:38.529
The last time I heard
from Penelope,

29:38.597 --> 29:40.258
she was in Tokio.

29:40.432 --> 29:43.196
She'll be in Honolulu
day after tomorrow.

29:43.702 --> 29:45.602
Kind of anxious
to see her, huh?

29:46.338 --> 29:47.532
Well,

29:47.907 --> 29:49.431
yes, actually.

29:49.775 --> 29:53.404
The idea has, uh, become
quite appealing to me,

29:53.479 --> 29:56.346
although I must confess,
it wasn't initially.

29:56.916 --> 29:58.679
The idea of
seeing her again has,

29:58.751 --> 30:00.343
as Shakespeare put it,

30:00.419 --> 30:03.354
"Summoned up remembrances
of things past."

30:03.422 --> 30:05.754
I remember the night
before I left for France.

30:05.824 --> 30:08.258
It was the last time
I was to see Penelope.

30:08.327 --> 30:10.158
We strolled along the Avon,

30:10.229 --> 30:12.197
as the sun,
shimmering on the water,

30:12.264 --> 30:14.698
slowly slipped
beyond the horizon.

30:14.767 --> 30:16.029
Her delicate cologne

30:16.101 --> 30:18.001
mingled with
the aroma of lilacs.

30:18.871 --> 30:22.068
Nearby, a village lad
was playing the concertina,

30:22.241 --> 30:24.004
a bittersweet song.

30:25.344 --> 30:27.574
I took her
in my arms and said:

30:28.180 --> 30:29.943
"I swear by Almighty God

30:30.015 --> 30:32.916
to be faithful
and bear true allegiance."

30:33.919 --> 30:35.386
Uh, say what?

30:36.922 --> 30:39.789
The last line of
the Yorkshire Regiment oath.

30:39.858 --> 30:41.826
Brought tears to her eyes.

30:42.294 --> 30:44.922
I say, Rick,
could I have a cigarette?

30:46.165 --> 30:47.189
No.

30:50.469 --> 30:52.369
What're you doing here?

30:53.405 --> 30:54.531
Come on, Rick.

30:54.773 --> 30:56.297
This is a private club.

30:57.743 --> 30:59.608
Do my ears deceive me?

30:59.678 --> 31:01.111
No, they don't.

31:02.281 --> 31:05.079
Well, in that case,
Magnum is here as my guest.

31:07.353 --> 31:09.218
He's helping me train.

31:13.258 --> 31:14.555
Well, uh,

31:14.626 --> 31:17.459
I got some things
I need to take care of.

31:19.331 --> 31:21.458
Knock her dead,
Higgie baby.

31:21.567 --> 31:22.693
T.C.,

31:24.236 --> 31:25.999
I didn't tell
Randolph about Rick.

31:26.071 --> 31:28.266
You should have told
Rick about Randolph.

31:28.340 --> 31:29.967
I couldn't.
It wasn't ethical.

31:30.042 --> 31:32.101
Man, I don't want to hear
this ethical madness.

31:32.177 --> 31:34.008
What's this Randolph cat
ever done for you

31:34.079 --> 31:35.171
compared to Rick?

31:35.247 --> 31:37.613
That's not the point!
Randolph was a client!

31:38.650 --> 31:40.345
Rick was your buddy.

31:51.597 --> 31:53.462
Sounds like
Charlie Doyle's business

31:53.532 --> 31:55.397
was a little closer
to home.

31:56.101 --> 31:58.001
Magnum, from
what I've just heard,

31:58.070 --> 31:59.560
you did the right thing.

31:59.638 --> 32:01.162
I know that, Higgins.

32:02.007 --> 32:05.374
I know that,
I just don't feel that way.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.274
Well, what's next
on my training agenda?

32:23.662 --> 32:25.960
<i>Normally, the chance</i>
<i>to make Higgins sweat</i>

32:26.031 --> 32:27.862
<i>would have seemed</i>
<i>like a lot of fun.</i>

32:27.933 --> 32:30.629
<i>Today,</i>
<i>it barely raised a smile.</i>

32:38.343 --> 32:39.469
Okay, Higgins,

32:39.545 --> 32:41.479
I think you've had
enough for today.

32:42.714 --> 32:44.045
Thank you.

32:49.421 --> 32:51.321
Good Lord!
Someone's shooting at us.

32:51.390 --> 32:53.358
I am aware of that, Higgins.

32:59.131 --> 33:00.621
I counted six.

33:00.699 --> 33:02.530
He can only have
three rounds left.

33:08.740 --> 33:11.004
Unless, of course,
he has another magazine.

33:11.743 --> 33:14.837
It sounds like a 9mm
Beretta semiautomatic.

33:15.447 --> 33:17.711
It'll wreak havoc
with the car.

33:43.408 --> 33:45.137
Bloody rotten luck.

33:50.816 --> 33:52.443
Hold on, Higgins.

34:02.828 --> 34:04.352
I say, Magnum,

34:04.429 --> 34:06.693
that was rather exhilarating.

34:07.199 --> 34:10.657
Reminds me of the time
I outraced a panzer tank.

34:11.235 --> 34:12.862
It was outside of Tobruk,

34:12.938 --> 34:15.031
and I was a halftrack
at the time,

34:15.107 --> 34:18.007
had two wounded tommies,
and an American GI.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.110
We were low on petrol

34:20.179 --> 34:22.841
when this tank appeared
over the rise.

34:28.853 --> 34:31.516
<i>How anyone so tired</i>
<i>could talk so much</i>

34:31.590 --> 34:32.716
<i>was beyond me.</i>

34:32.791 --> 34:34.782
<i>I ended up dropping</i>
<i>Higgins off at the estate</i>

34:34.860 --> 34:36.327
<i>and sending him for a swim.</i>

34:36.395 --> 34:39.228
<i>Then I got a pass into Pearl</i>
<i>and went looking for Mac.</i>

34:39.297 --> 34:40.958
<i>I needed his expertise,</i>
<i>and for once,</i>

34:41.033 --> 34:42.864
<i>wouldn't have to</i>
<i>con him out of it.</i>

34:42.935 --> 34:44.766
<i>I knew he'd say yes.</i>

34:44.902 --> 34:45.927
No.

34:46.004 --> 34:47.869
I haven't even asked
anything yet.

34:47.940 --> 34:49.931
Hearing the question
won't change the answer.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.101
Oh, I know, Mac,
you think I came here

34:52.177 --> 34:53.667
because I need
some information

34:53.745 --> 34:55.076
or I wanna use
your computer.

34:55.147 --> 34:56.170
Well, you're wrong.

34:56.248 --> 34:57.840
That's not what
I want at all.

34:57.916 --> 34:59.474
Well,
this ought to be good.

34:59.551 --> 35:01.075
Come on, Mac,
I'm on a case

35:01.153 --> 35:03.348
and I just simply need
your expertise.

35:03.422 --> 35:05.856
As a matter of fact, I'll even
supply the computers.

35:06.992 --> 35:08.584
Sure, and I suppose
you'll also pay me

35:08.660 --> 35:10.150
a consulting fee, right?

35:10.963 --> 35:12.328
Absolutely.

35:12.397 --> 35:13.921
Magnum,
get out of here, will you?

35:13.999 --> 35:15.694
Come on, Mac,
I'm serious.

35:16.902 --> 35:18.927
How serious?

35:21.840 --> 35:23.000
Uh...

35:23.208 --> 35:25.199
Say $20-an-hour serious.

35:28.614 --> 35:30.479
And all you want
is my expertise?

35:34.319 --> 35:36.583
And, uh, you're willing
to pay for it?

35:40.025 --> 35:41.686
And it's all legal?

35:47.666 --> 35:49.327
Well, now, I won't be
able to take off

35:49.401 --> 35:51.335
during the days,
but, uh, I could do it

35:51.403 --> 35:53.337
either late at night
or early in the morning.

35:53.405 --> 35:55.305
Night would be
just perfect, Mac.

36:36.064 --> 36:38.294
Don't they, uh,
give you a card?

36:38.366 --> 36:40.527
Mac, I'm their
security consultant.

36:40.602 --> 36:41.626
So?

36:41.703 --> 36:43.671
So I have to see
how good their security is.

36:43.738 --> 36:45.103
Ah! Here.

36:46.441 --> 36:48.500
I'll have to
recommend changing that.

37:00.255 --> 37:02.018
Magnum, you are
telling me the truth?

37:02.090 --> 37:03.148
Of course.

37:03.224 --> 37:04.657
I mean, you wouldn't
involve me

37:04.726 --> 37:05.920
in a breaking
and entering...

37:05.994 --> 37:07.222
Shh, Mac.

37:07.295 --> 37:09.092
I'm taking out a pick,

37:09.164 --> 37:11.189
and putting the pick
in the lock

37:11.266 --> 37:13.359
and picking our way in.

37:14.936 --> 37:15.960
There.

37:16.037 --> 37:17.664
Now you see
why they hired me.

37:17.739 --> 37:20.469
Their security system
is just pitiful.

37:37.358 --> 37:39.485
Now the leaks aren't
coming out physically,

37:39.561 --> 37:41.461
not the way the employees
are searched.

37:41.529 --> 37:44.089
Now, I think that our spy
is using a computer

37:44.165 --> 37:46.224
to relay the information
to a competitor.

37:46.301 --> 37:47.768
Now what I need you to do,

37:47.836 --> 37:49.064
is to find out
which computer

37:49.137 --> 37:51.002
has a suspicious
looking interface program.

37:51.072 --> 37:52.198
Oh, sure.

37:52.273 --> 37:54.764
But I can't do anything,
Magnum, without the codes.

37:54.843 --> 37:56.401
At least a magic wand
or something.

37:56.478 --> 37:58.002
Your magic wand.
Oh.

37:59.814 --> 38:01.782
Now tickle
those ivories, Mac.

38:06.087 --> 38:07.884
Hey, how can you
expect me to work?

38:07.956 --> 38:09.321
I'm sorry.

38:12.127 --> 38:13.526
Would you look at that?

38:14.129 --> 38:15.926
I'm looking.
What are we seeing?

38:15.997 --> 38:18.192
The 6-digit code,
somebody else is locked in.

38:18.266 --> 38:19.392
They've got priority.

38:19.467 --> 38:20.491
Huh?

38:20.568 --> 38:22.593
Two people can't use
a computer at the same time,

38:22.670 --> 38:23.932
when somebody else
is using it.

38:24.005 --> 38:25.097
Right now?
Right now.

38:25.173 --> 38:26.265
Can you tell me where?

38:26.341 --> 38:27.365
Yeah.

38:28.977 --> 38:30.103
Marketing?

38:30.178 --> 38:31.611
Research and development.

38:49.464 --> 38:52.092
Hello, Mr. Dixon.
You're working late.

39:00.675 --> 39:01.801
Mac,

39:01.943 --> 39:03.934
I'd like you
to meet our spy.

39:04.145 --> 39:06.113
Have a chair,
Mr. Dixon.

39:07.615 --> 39:09.014
Well, well.

39:09.184 --> 39:11.049
You know,
I've got to hand it to you.

39:11.119 --> 39:12.814
Selling secrets
and embezzling funds

39:12.887 --> 39:14.411
at the same time.
Takes guts.

39:14.489 --> 39:15.547
Embezzling?

39:15.623 --> 39:17.181
Yeah. I've been
playing around

39:17.258 --> 39:18.691
with the accounting codes.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.024
This morning someone
transferred $2 million,

39:21.095 --> 39:23.256
to a numbered bank account
in Switzerland,

39:23.331 --> 39:25.196
and didn't bother
to tell accounting.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.166
Where I come from,
that's a no-no.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.944
I didn't embezzle any money.

39:40.013 --> 39:41.275
Now you've got to
believe me!

39:41.347 --> 39:42.780
I don't believe
thieves,

39:42.849 --> 39:44.749
especially when
they try to kill me.

39:45.585 --> 39:47.246
I wasn't trying
to kill you.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.719
Just scare you a little.

39:48.788 --> 39:49.948
Well,
the first time worked.

39:50.023 --> 39:51.820
You didn't have to
come back for seconds.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.215
There was no second time.

39:54.894 --> 39:57.328
Look, you've got me
on industrial espionage,

39:57.397 --> 39:59.831
but I'm not gonna
take the rap for embezzlement.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.924
I don't even know
the accounting codes.

40:02.001 --> 40:03.298
Nobody has access to those

40:03.369 --> 40:04.859
except the people
in accounting,

40:04.938 --> 40:06.371
and the company president.

40:06.940 --> 40:08.601
Randolph has the codes?

40:08.675 --> 40:10.040
Of course,
as company president

40:10.109 --> 40:11.633
he has access to all codes.

40:14.647 --> 40:16.205
What's his home
phone number?

40:16.282 --> 40:17.579
No, you won't
reach him there.

40:17.650 --> 40:20.210
He's taking the corporate jet
to Japan this morning.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.426
You suppose you could play gin
without cheating?

40:34.934 --> 40:36.697
I have to talk
to Mrs. Randolph.

40:36.769 --> 40:39.135
Fine. Would you like
to wait on the terrace?

40:46.479 --> 40:48.970
Mrs. Randolph, uh, there is
someone here to see you.

40:49.048 --> 40:50.447
Thank you.

41:10.436 --> 41:11.903
What are you doing here?

41:11.971 --> 41:13.097
I've got to
talk to you.

41:13.172 --> 41:14.298
Rick, this is insane!

41:14.374 --> 41:16.137
I know your husband
found out about us,

41:16.209 --> 41:17.938
and you're scared.
I understand.

41:18.011 --> 41:19.535
There is nothing
to understand.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.739
Rick, I've given it
a lot of thought, it's over.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.715
Claudia, you can't just
throw everything away

41:24.784 --> 41:25.808
that we've had.

41:25.885 --> 41:27.284
Everything that we've had?

41:28.454 --> 41:30.718
Rick, they were
a few brief encounters.

41:30.790 --> 41:31.848
They were nice.

41:31.924 --> 41:33.915
But we weren't together
for the right reason.

41:33.993 --> 41:36.154
Since when isn't love
the right reason?

41:38.531 --> 41:40.158
Rick, I don't love you.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.959
I don't believe that,
Claudia.

41:43.036 --> 41:44.333
Look, I've got to go.

41:44.404 --> 41:46.838
My husband's waiting for me
right now at the airport.

41:46.906 --> 41:48.430
We're flying to Japan
on business.

41:48.508 --> 41:49.770
I'll take you
to the airport.

41:49.842 --> 41:50.866
What?

41:50.943 --> 41:52.808
You got to give me
a chance to convince you.

41:52.879 --> 41:54.574
Believe me, I love you.

41:54.647 --> 41:56.512
Rick, I do believe you.

41:56.582 --> 41:59.142
But that doesn't mean
that my feelings have to be...

41:59.218 --> 42:00.344
If you can go off
with him,

42:00.420 --> 42:02.820
then I'll believe everything
that you're saying.

42:02.922 --> 42:05.186
But I gotta see it
for myself.

42:06.025 --> 42:08.289
Why are you making it
so hard on yourself?

42:12.699 --> 42:14.826
<i>I should've recognized</i>
<i>the coincidence,</i>

42:14.901 --> 42:16.732
<i>since any objective</i>
<i>private investigator</i>

42:16.803 --> 42:18.737
<i>would've seen</i>
<i>through the whole thing.</i>

42:18.805 --> 42:21.103
<i>That's where Randolph</i>
<i>played it so smart.</i>

42:21.174 --> 42:23.301
<i>He took away my objectivity.</i>

42:23.376 --> 42:24.502
<i>Worse than that,</i>

42:24.577 --> 42:27.444
<i>he exploited</i>
<i>the vulnerability of a friend.</i>

42:54.640 --> 42:57.108
Claudia, I still just
don't understand.

42:57.176 --> 42:59.167
Rick, haven't you
ever been in relationships

42:59.245 --> 43:00.576
that just didn't work?

43:00.646 --> 43:02.841
Yeah, but there's
no reason for it.

43:02.915 --> 43:04.576
There usually never is.

43:04.650 --> 43:06.140
Claudia.

43:08.488 --> 43:09.978
Don't worry about it.
Just tell him

43:10.056 --> 43:12.217
I'm a friend that
drove you to the airport.

43:13.092 --> 43:14.218
Anything wrong?

43:14.293 --> 43:15.351
No, darling.

43:15.428 --> 43:17.396
Rick, this is
my husband, Jim.

43:18.965 --> 43:20.956
Rick was kind enough
to give me a ride.

43:21.033 --> 43:22.591
I appreciate that.

43:22.668 --> 43:25.034
Wouldn't want to go
flying off without my wife.

43:25.438 --> 43:26.598
No problem.

43:26.672 --> 43:28.003
Well, I guess
we'd better be off.

43:28.074 --> 43:29.132
Yes.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.539
Oh, great!

43:32.178 --> 43:34.669
Can't you just
stay out of my life?

43:38.217 --> 43:40.310
Get back in the car,
Magnum.

43:40.386 --> 43:42.479
You're gonna use him
all the way, aren't you?

43:43.523 --> 43:45.013
Back off now!

43:49.028 --> 43:50.393
I'm not bluffing.

43:50.463 --> 43:52.260
Oh, I think you are.

43:52.999 --> 43:55.832
See, you're an embezzler,
Mr. Randolph, not a killer.

43:56.369 --> 43:59.304
But if you want to
shoot him, you go ahead.

43:59.572 --> 44:01.938
Because you won't have time
to get to me,

44:02.008 --> 44:04.238
and you sure as hell
won't get away.

44:04.310 --> 44:05.743
No, Jim! No!

44:11.117 --> 44:12.914
You hold her!
I'll get him.

44:42.748 --> 44:44.375
Randolph!

44:58.231 --> 45:00.256
I don't understand
what happens to me.

45:00.333 --> 45:02.062
I get wrapped up
in something like that,

45:02.134 --> 45:03.260
and I lose touch.

45:03.336 --> 45:05.600
Someone says to me,
"Believe me."

45:05.938 --> 45:07.803
I say, "Okay."

45:08.407 --> 45:10.773
I'm a big sucker.
A big fat sucker.

45:12.311 --> 45:14.040
You know,
I could've gotten killed,

45:14.113 --> 45:15.944
if you hadn't have...

45:16.782 --> 45:18.977
I could've got killed,
period.

45:19.218 --> 45:21.083
You were gonna let
Randolph shoot me.

45:21.153 --> 45:22.245
No, I wasn't.

45:22.321 --> 45:23.720
Then what was
all that about:

45:23.789 --> 45:25.017
"Go ahead,
if you shoot Rick,

45:25.091 --> 45:26.388
you won't have time
to get me"?

45:26.459 --> 45:28.051
Well, I knew he was bluffing.

45:28.895 --> 45:30.260
How did you know?

45:33.799 --> 45:36.324
I just knew, that's all.
Believe me.

45:38.337 --> 45:39.463
Okay.

45:42.341 --> 45:43.808
You know, I can't believe

45:43.876 --> 45:46.538
what Higgie baby
went through for this.

45:48.381 --> 45:49.780
I bet she barks.

45:50.917 --> 45:52.441
Come on, T.C.,
that's an old picture.

45:52.518 --> 45:54.145
She probably looks
a lot different now.

45:54.220 --> 45:55.881
Yeah,
about 40 years uglier.

46:16.542 --> 46:17.975
Hi, Higgins.

46:19.211 --> 46:22.476
Now, Higgie baby,
that is bad.

46:23.649 --> 46:24.980
Thank you.

46:25.618 --> 46:27.677
I am assuming
that is a compliment.

46:27.753 --> 46:28.777
Right on.

46:28.854 --> 46:30.253
Higgins, you look great.

46:30.323 --> 46:33.190
Penelope's gonna be in for
a hell of a surprise, honest.

47:06.525 --> 47:08.516
Ah, Jonathan.

47:09.462 --> 47:10.759
Penelope.

47:11.831 --> 47:13.890
It's been a long time.

47:15.001 --> 47:16.127
Yes.

47:16.635 --> 47:18.034
Yes, it has.

47:24.076 --> 47:25.100
Oh.

47:25.177 --> 47:27.702
Jonathan, I'd like you
to meet Paolo.

47:28.814 --> 47:30.941
My traveling companion.

47:33.119 --> 47:35.849
We've been
all around the worid.
