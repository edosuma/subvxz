WEBVTT

00:06.298 --> 00:08.883
Sharon is a very funny woman,

00:08.967 --> 00:11.511
but she has less faith
in American individualism than I do.

00:11.595 --> 00:15.014
Hang on, I have plenty of...
When did I ever express any lack of faith?

00:15.099 --> 00:18.393
I didn't say and never said
that Barack Obama was a socialist.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.395
- Seriously?
- What I said and I have always said...

00:20.479 --> 00:22.188
Lewis, you are begging me
to run a sound package

00:22.272 --> 00:24.607
Monday morning that
shows you hundreds of times

00:24.692 --> 00:26.693
calling the president a socialist.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.528
I'll read your columns on the air.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.155
The policies are, look up the definition,
my friend, they're socialist.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.866
By your definition, so were Ronald Reagan's.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.743
What do you think taxes are?

00:35.828 --> 00:37.120
That was the last great president.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.955
American individualism
can't build roads.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.124
- An individual...
- Go on, get it all out.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.876
Thank you,
since the question was addressed to me.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.588
An individual can't build a school
or assemble an army...

00:47.673 --> 00:49.716
No one's talking about
disbanding the army.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.718
So we can agree
that the government is good for that?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.636
- Yes. Fine.
- Yes.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.848
A fire department, good idea or bad idea?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.474
You are getting so worked up, Sharon.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.476
I'm afraid you're gonna start shooting
light out of your ass.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.771
Good idea or bad idea
on the fire department?

01:03.856 --> 01:06.357
Or should it be a private fire department

01:06.442 --> 01:09.819
that only comes to your burning house
if you paid your monthly fire bill?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.238
I am more than happy to pay
for a fire department.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.865
I am not happy to pay for a painting

01:13.949 --> 01:16.743
that I don't wanna look at,
poetry I don't wanna read.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.953
You can't skip right to the NEA!

01:19.037 --> 01:20.913
And you cannot skip right to the army.

01:44.897 --> 01:49.984
0.00004% of the federal budget

01:50.068 --> 01:55.031
and is code for New York,
Jewish, perverted and gay.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.658
- Will.
- Yes, sir.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.536
Anything to add?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.291
I think we'd need a more
precise definition of "perverted."

02:05.375 --> 02:07.376
Okay.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.504
We'll go on to the next question.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.798
- You, sir.
- My name's Steven.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.300
I'm a junior
and my question is for Will McAvoy.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.763
Do you consider yourself a Democrat,
a Republican or Independent?

02:20.390 --> 02:23.100
I consider myself a New York Jets fan, Steven.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.978
Since it's been brought up,

02:26.063 --> 02:31.192
you've almost religiously avoided stating
or even implying a political allegiance.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.027
Is that because as a news anchor

02:33.111 --> 02:35.905
you feel the integrity of your broadcast
would be compromised?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.742
That sounds like a good answer. I'll take it.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.579
There was a short piece
on Vanity Fair's website

02:43.664 --> 02:46.082
by Marshall Westbrook, you probably saw it,

02:46.166 --> 02:49.252
where he calls you
the "Jay Leno of news anchors."

02:49.461 --> 02:51.629
You're popular
because you don't bother anyone.

02:51.713 --> 02:52.713
Yeah.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.423
How do you feel about that?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.762
Jealous of the size of Jay's audience.

02:59.847 --> 03:04.225
Are you willing to say here tonight
whether you lean right or left?

03:06.645 --> 03:10.398
I've voted for candidates
run by both major parties.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.192
Let's move on to the next question.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.528
- Go ahead.
- Hi. My name is Jenny.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.155
I'm a sophomore,
and this is for all three of you.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.118
Can you say in one sentence or less...

03:22.786 --> 03:24.662
Um, you know what I mean.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.749
Can you say why America
is the greatest country in the world?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.670
Diversity and opportunity.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.963
Lewis.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.091
Freedom and freedom.
So let's keep it that way.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.927
Will.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.306
The New York Jets.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.977
No, I'm gonna hold you to an answer on that.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.230
What makes America
the greatest country in the world?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.152
Well, Lewis and Sharon said it,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.738
diversity, and opportunity,
and freedom and freedom.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.043
I'm not letting you
go back to the airport

04:12.127 --> 04:13.336
without answering the question.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.808
Well, our Constitution is a masterpiece.
James Madison was a genius.

04:27.893 --> 04:32.021
The Declaration of Independence is, for me,
the single greatest piece of American writing.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.443
You don't look satisfied.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.197
One's a set of laws
and the other's a declaration of war.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.407
I want a human moment from you.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.956
What about the people? Why is America...

04:50.040 --> 04:51.666
It's not the greatest country
in the world, Professor.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.042
That's my answer.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.464
- You're saying...
- Yes.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.927
- Let's talk about...
- Fine. Sharon, the NEA is a loser.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.929
Yeah, it accounts for a penny
out of our paycheck,

05:05.013 --> 05:06.764
but he gets to hit you
with it any time he wants.

05:06.848 --> 05:10.309
It doesn't cost money, it costs votes.
It costs airtime and column inches.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.187
You know why people don't like liberals?
Because they lose.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.524
If liberals are so fuckin' smart,
how come they lose so goddamn always?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.817
- Hey...
- And with a straight face

05:17.901 --> 05:19.485
you're gonna tell students

05:19.569 --> 05:21.737
that America is so star-spangled awesome

05:21.822 --> 05:24.115
that we're the only ones
in the world who have freedom?

05:24.199 --> 05:27.034
Canada has freedom. Japan has freedom.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.329
The UK, France, Italy,
Germany, Spain, Australia.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.790
Belgium has freedom!

05:32.874 --> 05:35.960
207 sovereign states in the world,
like 180 of them have freedom.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.170
- All right...
- And, yeah, you, sorority girl.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.007
Just in case you accidentally wander
into a voting booth one day,

05:41.091 --> 05:42.883
there are some things you should know,
and one of them is

05:42.968 --> 05:44.343
there is absolutely no evidence

05:44.428 --> 05:47.096
to support the statement
that we're the greatest country in the world.

05:47.180 --> 05:52.685
We're seventh in literacy, 27th in math,
22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy,

05:52.769 --> 05:56.522
178th in infant mortality,
third in median household income,

05:56.606 --> 05:58.691
number four in labor force,
and number four in exports.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.235
We lead the world in only three categories,

06:01.319 --> 06:05.823
number of incarcerated citizens per capita,
number of adults who believe angels are real,

06:05.907 --> 06:09.326
and defense spending where we spend
more than the next 26 countries combined,

06:09.411 --> 06:10.870
25 of whom are allies.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.372
Now, none of this is the fault
of a 20-year-old college student,

06:13.457 --> 06:15.166
but you nonetheless are without a doubt

06:15.250 --> 06:18.878
a member of the worst period
generation period ever period.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.839
So when you ask what makes us
the greatest country in the world,

06:21.923 --> 06:24.383
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.968
Yosemite?

06:38.315 --> 06:40.066
We sure used to be.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.069
We stood up for what was right.

06:44.196 --> 06:48.741
We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws,
struck down laws for moral reasons.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.494
We waged wars on poverty, not poor people.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.914
We sacrificed. We cared about our neighbors.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.833
We put our money where our mouths were,
and we never beat our chest.

06:58.085 --> 07:02.755
We built great big things,
made ungodly technological advances,

07:02.839 --> 07:07.968
explored the universe, cured diseases,
and we cultivated the world's greatest artists

07:08.053 --> 07:10.179
and the world's greatest economy.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.517
We reached for the stars,

07:16.645 --> 07:17.895
acted like men.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.147
We aspired to intelligence.
We didn't belittle it.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.191
It didn't make us feel inferior.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.946
We didn't identify ourselves
by who we voted for in the last election,

07:27.030 --> 07:29.990
and we didn't... We didn't scare so easy.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.119
Huh.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.747
We were able to be all these things
and do all these things

07:36.832 --> 07:38.833
because we were informed.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.003
By great men, men who were revered.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.551
First step in solving any problem
is recognizing there is one.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.223
America is not the greatest country
in the world anymore.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.312
Enough?

08:07.946 --> 08:10.156
- What the fuck was that?
- Are you out of your mind? That was a kid.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.826
I'm sorry! I'm taking medicine for vertigo,
and I think it works because I've got it.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.828
You're in trouble, man.
You can't talk to me like that.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.496
- Do you need a doctor?
- Jesus Christ.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.248
Listen, listen!

08:20.584 --> 08:22.126
What did I say out there?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.634
I'm excited to meet them, too, but...

10:44.436 --> 10:47.146
I'm excited to meet them, too, but not tonight.
It's just too soon.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.314
When did you decide that?

10:48.398 --> 10:52.151
I really can't pinpoint the time.
I have to get back into my meeting.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.652
It's not a meeting, it's a party.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.987
- There's pizza.
- We've been dating for four months,

10:55.071 --> 10:56.322
and I think that's too soon
to meet her parents.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.408
That's like level three stuff.
We're at level two. Can I get a ruling?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.368
When your conversation
started in front of my desk,

11:01.453 --> 11:04.538
I was concerned that I'd been caught
in the middle of something personal,

11:04.622 --> 11:07.041
but I can see now
that I was worried for nothing.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.127
I think it's too soon to meet your parents.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.004
I'm not comfortable with it.
Can you respect that?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.422
I've been telling them
about you for months.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.506
What am I supposed to say?

11:14.591 --> 11:15.924
- That I had to work late.
- Why?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.426
Why does anybody ever have to work late?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.677
They don't. They're usually lying.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.262
That's true, but I know that you can sell it.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.639
Now why would you make a dumb decision
when I'm offering...

11:22.724 --> 11:24.641
Loyalty, I'm making a dumb decision
out of loyalty.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.477
You're making a smart one out of ambition.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.644
Yeah.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.897
He can't remember your name, Maggie,
and I'm the asshole.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.940
I was an intern,
and he promoted me to his assistant.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.277
He didn't promote you, honey.
He thought you were his assistant.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.239
You have to go back to your pizza meeting,
but could you do me a favor

11:39.324 --> 11:40.699
and not talk about us in front of...

11:40.784 --> 11:42.701
Everybody here knows. Nobody here cares.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.912
They will once we start fighting
in the middle of the newsroom,

11:44.996 --> 11:46.372
and one of us is gonna get fired.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.916
Do you think it's gonna be the hotshot EP
out of Columbia J-school

11:49.000 --> 11:52.169
or you think it's gonna be the intern
who got accidentally promoted to assistant?

11:52.629 --> 11:53.962
You're making a mistake.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.631
I'm used to them by now.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.132
- Loyalty?
- Yep.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.595
He just walked into his office
without noticing that his staff isn't here.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.643
Text me when you're done
with your parents tonight.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.983
Where's... Where is everybody?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.361
Welcome back, man.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.072
Thanks. Where is everybody?

12:20.615 --> 12:22.324
You gotta go up to see Charlie.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.452
Okay. Where is everybody?

12:25.537 --> 12:28.914
I have strict orders from Charlie not to say
anything until he's talked to you first.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.332
I've got a meeting.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.001
What's going on?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.719
Okay. Ooh!

12:43.346 --> 12:44.930
Couldn't say the answer from over there?

12:45.014 --> 12:46.348
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.058
Charlie Skinner needs to see you in his office.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.852
- Now?
- He said as soon as you come in.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.353
What's... You're Ellen?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.147
- Maggie, Margaret.
- What's going on?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.898
We know as little as you do.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.442
- Really?
- Almost as little as you do.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.901
What's the part that you know that I don't?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.903
- You should talk to Charlie Skinner.
- Where's Karen?

13:00.363 --> 13:02.489
- There's no one who works here named Karen.
- My assistant.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.700
- I'm your assistant.
- You're Ellen.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.702
- Margaret.
- Okay.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.204
Uh, I'll let his secretary know
you're on your way.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.581
Her name is Karen.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.958
No one's named Karen. No one.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.793
- All right.
- I'll call up for you.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.800
Angela, hi. It's Maggie from downstairs.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.844
- You can go on in. He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.971
You own this now,
my friend. You have bought it.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.266
You have paid for it and you have the receipt.
I wanna be crystal clear, this is yours.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.434
You're wearing it.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.227
- Henry wants me to make sure you know that.
- Wait.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.979
Mr. Will McAvoy has just
stepped into my office,

13:34.063 --> 13:35.898
so I need to walk him through this.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.691
- Shit, how much does he know?
- You're on speaker.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.984
I don't know anything. Who is this?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.153
Heh-hey, Will! How was the vaca...

13:42.614 --> 13:44.031
Welcome back. You look great.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.365
I don't know what just happened there.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.744
Two weeks in Saint Lucia
was just what the doctor ordered, literally.

13:49.579 --> 13:50.996
- You've got pictures?
- No.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.664
Don't worry about it. TMZ does.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.083
- You were down there with Erin Andrews.
- There's a picture?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.461
No, that was a trap,
but I knew you were seeing her.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.297
- All right, seriously, what the hell's going on?
- Something exciting.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.966
Hardly anybody who works for me
is where they usually are.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.219
- I was in a bar in Da Nang.
- Just now?

14:05.303 --> 14:06.512
1969.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.015
I was embedded with
the 144th Artillery for UPI,

14:10.099 --> 14:14.603
and I was sitting there with a warm Coke,
watching a beautiful Vietnamese woman

14:14.687 --> 14:17.814
doing an exotic dance
right in the middle of everybody.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.691
A beautiful, beautiful woman.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.527
And I thought to myself,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.863
"I will never know what it is
to be with a woman like that."

14:25.114 --> 14:28.325
And at that exact moment,
the woman spun twice,

14:28.409 --> 14:30.911
teetered over, and fell right into my lap.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.289
That was a story about how sometimes
things fall right into your lap.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.959
Where's my staff?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.753
The answer to that question has several parts.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.549
First, we're gonna try Elliot out at 10:00.
He's starting in two weeks.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.884
Good. Thank you.
With the right EP, he'll do great at 10:00.

14:45.969 --> 14:49.096
I think so, too, and I know how much
he appreciates your lobbying hard for him.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.556
He really looks up to you.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.140
What's this got to do with my staff?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.518
- He's taking your staff.
- What are you talking about?

14:54.602 --> 14:58.397
Well, strictly speaking, he's taking your EP
and your EP's taking your staff.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.232
- Wait, Don's going with Elliot?
- Listen...

15:00.316 --> 15:01.900
- Where is he?
- There's no need...

15:01.985 --> 15:03.735
- Where is he?
- They're both...

15:03.820 --> 15:06.780
Don got everyone pizza.
They're in one of the conference rooms.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.031
Will!

15:08.116 --> 15:10.534
I gave him his first job on the air,
his first job on a panel,

15:10.618 --> 15:12.452
his first job as a substitute anchor.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.746
I make it known to anyone
who matters I'd like to see him at 10:00.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.583
- He poaches Don.
- Elliot didn't poach him. Don asked to go.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.668
- He asked to go? He asked to go?
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.379
- Because of what happened?
- Absolutely not. That's over.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.922
It's not over. The story won't end.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.757
Did anybody hear
the second half of what I said?

15:25.842 --> 15:27.759
- I made a rousing call...
- It's not why Don's leaving.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.136
Why is he leaving?

15:29.304 --> 15:30.512
Oh!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.849
Yeah, I get that there are moments,
small moments, infrequent moments,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.350
where I'm not the easiest guy to work with,

15:35.435 --> 15:36.852
- but who the hell is?
- I am.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.770
Well, it helps
that you're drunk most of the time.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.439
It certainly does. Do me a favor...

15:40.523 --> 15:42.274
This is more than unprofessional,
it's uncivilized.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.567
But more than that, it's unprofessional.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.277
- Just do me a favor, okay?
- Sure.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.446
- Try not to make a scene...
- Hey, dickless!

15:47.530 --> 15:50.073
Not you. You're in a minute. You.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.742
Hey, Will.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.702
Congratulations on the show.
You're gonna do great.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.662
I'd have called you,
but I didn't know where you were staying.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.289
I kept getting an out-of-the-office reply.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.041
You're taking my executive producer?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.335
Before you go any further, I strongly objected.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.128
- Did you?
- For all the reasons...

16:03.212 --> 16:05.922
- I think this conversation's about me.
- Catlike instincts.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.799
I tried to get in touch with you,
but Charlie said...

16:07.884 --> 16:08.967
- You asked to leave?
- I did,

16:09.052 --> 16:10.844
- but we have two weeks before...
- Because of what happened?

16:10.928 --> 16:12.471
Because the second half
was a rousing call to...

16:12.555 --> 16:14.556
- It has nothing to do with what happened.
- The timing is curious.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.933
Didn't you tell him it doesn't have anything
to do with what happened?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.478
Yes, and talk to him
when you're talking to him.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.813
After all the time
we spent working side by side?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.857
I've been your EP for 13 weeks.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.484
That's the longest
I've ever worked with anybody!

16:25.652 --> 16:28.487
I mean, you were the one. You were my guy.
We were like the Everly Brothers.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.072
You'll interview some good candidates.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.240
Don, please, I'll replace you in 15 minutes.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.911
You know, it wasn't
the anti-American thing, Will,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.955
or even that you aimed a profanity-laced
tirade at a college sophomore...

16:39.040 --> 16:42.459
She's talking about suing the university
for mental anguish.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.003
- Talking about it to who?
- Mostly Kathie Lee and Hoda.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.047
- Guess who her lawyer is.
- If you say Gloria Allred...

16:47.131 --> 16:50.092
- It's your personality.
- What?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.094
The reason I'm leaving
and the reason the others are.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.512
I'm affable!

16:53.596 --> 16:57.808
To strangers, to people who watch you on TV.
You yelled at me in front of the crew.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.686
- That's what this is about.
- Yes, that's what this is about.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.604
Yeah, you know, I thought
you were talking into my ear.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.855
That's what I'm supposed to do.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.899
I had Stanley McChrystal
on satellite from Kandahar.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.111
He's being shot at by the fucking Taliban,
and you were yakking in my ear.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.363
I wasn't yakking.
I was telling you not to let him off the hook.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.657
Was that something
that really needed to be said four times?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.158
Yeah, because you let him off the hook,

17:15.243 --> 17:17.494
as was pointed out by everyone
with Internet access.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.955
You blew that interview,
and you took it out on me.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.373
It was two days
after the thing with the student.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.750
I thought it would be a good idea
to show deference to a three-star...

17:23.835 --> 17:26.503
You took it out on me,
you did it in front of the staff,

17:26.587 --> 17:28.797
then you took it out on the staff
the way you're doing right now.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.799
The staff isn't here!

17:30.883 --> 17:34.219
You're taking the department heads.
Who the hell knows who they're taking?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.470
Maggie's standing right there.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.681
Her name happens to be Ellen!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.226
It's Margaret.

17:41.310 --> 17:45.272
And simply put, you are a smart,
talented guy who isn't very nice

17:45.356 --> 17:47.232
and the countdown
to your retirement from relevance...

17:47.316 --> 17:48.608
- All right.
...started the moment you called

17:48.693 --> 17:50.152
conservatives idiots and liberals losers.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.571
- That's enough.
- A bad reaction to vertigo medicine?

17:52.655 --> 17:53.905
- Don.
- Did you just send that gift-wrapped

17:53.990 --> 17:55.240
to every comedian in the world?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.742
I didn't have a lot of time to think.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.994
- Do you think maybe if you'd let me prep you!
- Don.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.079
- You had a brand!
- I'm a Marine, Don!

18:01.164 --> 18:04.291
I will beat the shit out of you!
I don't care how many protein bars you eat.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.626
Hey, hey, hey, hey. All right.

18:10.047 --> 18:14.134
All right, look, I'm sorry I said all that.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.219
No, it's easier to say than the truth.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.722
- What?
- You're jumping a sinking ship.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.808
You've always been
the smartest guy around here.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.523
I appreciate you promoting me up
as fast as you did.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.108
And I will work with whoever you hire

18:30.193 --> 18:33.028
to make it a smooth transition
over the next two weeks.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.450
- Is that the afternoon brief?
- Yeah.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.208
I'm... I'm sorry about all this.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.711
No, no, no. Good luck with the show, man.
I'm here for whatever you need.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.385
You did let McChrystal off the hook because
you were gun-shy after Northwestern.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.471
- He was right about that.
- I didn't let him off the hook.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.973
He's a general.
He's a professional strategist, Charlie.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.558
He's schooled in evasive tactics.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.227
Against armies, not journalists.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.563
Chief Brody, Hooper, and Captain Quint didn't
let Jaws off the hook is what I'm saying.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.731
All right.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.692
- I didn't know.
- What?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.028
I didn't know that people
didn't like working for me.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.696
- Do you care?
- No.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.990
Of course I care. Anybody would care.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.368
But honestly, I don't.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.539
I do. I am a perfectly nice guy
and I have the focus group data to prove it,

19:25.623 --> 19:27.249
so maybe the problem lies not with me...

19:27.333 --> 19:30.043
- I hired a new EP for you.
- What do you mean?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.712
I hired you a new EP.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.506
You hi... You...

19:34.590 --> 19:38.510
I'm never going on vacation again.
You hired a new EP without my meeting him?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.345
- Her.
- Without my meeting her?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.055
- No, you've met her.
- Who?

19:44.976 --> 19:49.938
Charlie, have you hired to run my show,
without consulting me...

19:50.022 --> 19:51.439
You were unreachable.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.525
Only one person knew
how to get in touch with you.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.861
- It was you!
- I had to right the ship.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.447
You know that for this particular job,
there's no one better.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.033
You're not talking about MacKenzie.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.869
I had to right the ship.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.871
You're too big an asset to screw around with

20:05.955 --> 20:09.040
and your focus group data
isn't saying what it said three weeks ago.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.876
- Charlie...
- She was in Peshawar...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.878
- Oh, my God.
- For four months.

20:12.962 --> 20:17.257
The Green Zone for a year before that.
Her guys were filing stories from caves.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.927
She comes home, she wants to be
an EP again, have a normal life,

20:21.012 --> 20:24.347
and there's nothing for her at CNN,
nothing for her at ABC.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.683
- I knew that.
- She's exhausted.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.188
Not like at the end of a long day.
She's mentally and physically exhausted.

20:32.315 --> 20:35.734
She hasn't had four hours' sleep in two years.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.320
She's been shot at
in three different countries.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.324
And she's been to way too many funerals
for a girl her age.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.410
- She wants to come home.
- Yeah, look, I don't blame her.

20:45.494 --> 20:49.414
They don't have a job for her in Atlanta,
DC, or New York.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.250
MacKenzie... Line up any 10 people,

20:52.335 --> 20:54.669
eight of them will tell you
she's the best EP in the business

20:54.754 --> 20:56.463
and the other two will be stupid!

20:57.173 --> 20:59.215
I'm one of the eight,
but it's not gonna happen.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.759
- It's happened.
- No.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.595
She's coming up from DC today
with one of her people.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.014
No, listen to what I'm telling you.
I can't give my approval.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.350
The deal's a day away from being signed,
three years.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.602
I have approval over my executive producer.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.021
- You would think so, wouldn't you?
- I would, yeah.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.148
Business Affairs
went through your whole deal.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.650
I don't have contractual approval?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.777
- No. But you know what?
- I don't have contractual approval?

21:18.861 --> 21:21.696
You're up for renegotiation in 18 months.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.239
I'd have your agent put that clause...

21:23.574 --> 21:25.283
No, I'm walking down the street
to William Morris.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.953
- I'm gonna renegotiate my contract right now.
- It's not gonna go your way.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.665
I generate an annual profit
of $210 million on my own.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.542
That's not counting the lead-in freight
I push to 9:00 and 10:00.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.295
That may be tipping money for this company,
but it's not nothing.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.463
- Will.
- What?

21:38.547 --> 21:39.965
When was the last time you saw her?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.341
I don't know. About three years ago.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.135
Coincidentally,
that's the last time you were a nice guy!

21:47.223 --> 21:49.307
Would you like another, Mr. Skinner?

21:49.392 --> 21:50.517
Yes, please.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.687
Most notably Lehman's
former CEO Richard Fuld,

21:53.771 --> 21:57.148
seen here testifying to the House Oversight
Committee on Capitol Hill.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.568
The 2,200 pages report a serious lapse
by top executives

22:00.653 --> 22:03.071
and details the accounting gimmick
used by Lehman,

22:03.155 --> 22:06.449
including the use of something
they call the Repo 105

22:06.575 --> 22:09.828
to move about $50 billion
in debt off of the books.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.330
They say the company withheld information.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.874
They further outlined an auditor failure,
saying that

22:14.959 --> 22:17.627
Ernst & Young basically was performing...

22:17.712 --> 22:19.004
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

22:19.088 --> 22:21.172
- I'm MacKenzie McHale.
- How can I help you?

22:21.257 --> 22:23.383
I'm supposed to be meeting with Will.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.844
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.887
- You're MacKenzie.
- I am. And you are?

22:27.972 --> 22:29.389
- I'm Mag...
- Mac.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.599
Hey, Don.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.353
MacKenzie gave me
my first summer internship.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.856
Don't tell me you're here
to interview for my job.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.524
No, I'm here to do your job.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.359
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.278
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.071
When were you hired?

22:45.156 --> 22:47.449
- Is Will in his office?
- He's not, but his agent's office

22:47.533 --> 22:49.701
is just down the street,
and he should be back any minute.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.165
- He's at his agent's office?
- Yes...

22:57.084 --> 22:58.960
- I'm sorry. I gave too much information.
- Yep.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.422
- Now I understand.
- What's your name?

23:02.506 --> 23:04.174
- Maggie.
- Maggie.

23:04.258 --> 23:08.261
Let me try to guess at something,
and you tell me how close I am to being right.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.556
This whole move was done behind Will's back
and he just found out now,

23:11.640 --> 23:15.810
and he stormed off to his agent's office
to see why he doesn't have approval.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.147
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.316
Okay.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.528
All right, you're going to see some things.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.076
I'm just gonna sit here till he gets back.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.369
I'm going to sit here.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.497
Good luck.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.375
This still looking good to you?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.471
You said your name was Maggie?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.473
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am? How old do I look?

23:53.557 --> 23:56.601
No! No, no, no.
I heard you were embedded for a while.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.436
Twenty-six months.
Anything happen while I was gone?

23:58.521 --> 24:00.772
- That's why I called you ma'am.
- So did the Marines.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.816
You sure don't look like you've been in a war.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.026
The first thing I did when I got back
was buy women's clothes.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.569
I maxed out three credit cards.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.863
But I figured, "Hey, the economy's booming,
so what the heck."

24:08.948 --> 24:10.615
- Oh, God.
- I'm kidding.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.203
- Oh, excuse me.
- It's all right.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.791
Hi, Dad. I'm fine.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.960
I left a message for you and Mom at the hotel

24:22.044 --> 24:25.713
because I wanted to let you know
it'll just be the three of us for dinner tonight.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.257
Don can't make it.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.718
He has to work late.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.973
He just does. You know, with him
running 10:00 now, he's so...

24:35.057 --> 24:39.227
And he feels terrible about it.
He was really looking forward to meeting you.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.730
I know, but in this case it's true.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.486
So, great.
So I'll meet you guys in the lobby at 9:15.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.904
Okay. Bye, Dad.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.415
You okay?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.917
Oh, I've just got an allergy.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.335
To what?

25:05.254 --> 25:06.629
Oysters.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.511
- I hate lying to my father.
- I wasn't lying.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.681
Yeah. Why won't Don go to dinner?
He thinks it's too early?

25:19.018 --> 25:21.769
- Don's not my boyfriend.
- He's in a picture on your desk.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.022
It's with a couple of your friends
so it's not obvious,

25:24.106 --> 25:26.065
but it's a picture of your boyfriend.

25:26.150 --> 25:29.110
- I don't care. I'm not reporting you to HR.
- Thank you.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.529
Does he want you to do things in the bedroom
you're uncomfortable with?

25:31.614 --> 25:32.906
- No.
- Damn it.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.115
These are just routine questions.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.075
You put that all together really fast.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.952
It's not an original story.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.541
My dad knew I was lying.

25:43.626 --> 25:47.253
Now he's gonna hate Don,
and that's not what I wanted to happen.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.055
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Your eyes are red.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.015
Turn and face me.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.937
When he calls you tonight at 11:00
and wants to come by,

26:04.021 --> 26:05.605
don't lay on a tone of voice,

26:05.689 --> 26:07.690
just tell him real nice
that you're hanging with your roommates

26:07.775 --> 26:09.275
and you'll see him at work.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.945
Do that three times. He'll get the idea.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.823
Are you going with Don to 10:00?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.825
- No.
- Why not?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.869
It's just that I was...

26:22.122 --> 26:24.999
Loyalty. I'm Will's assistant.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.503
No, associate producer.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.422
You're an associate producer now.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.758
I'm crazy about loyalty.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.594
- You'll report to him.
- Mac! Mac!

26:36.929 --> 26:40.098
Did you know, did you know...

26:40.474 --> 26:42.100
- Are you all right?
- Jim, that's Louis Vuitton luggage.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.935
I'm fine, thank you.
Can I talk to you a second?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.895
Sure. James Harper, this is Maggie...

26:45.980 --> 26:47.438
- Margaret.
- This is Maggie Margaret.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.940
Margaret Jordan. Maggie's fine.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.733
Nice to meet you. Now, please.

26:51.402 --> 26:54.654
- Did you hurt anything?
- Everything, I think, but please...

26:57.032 --> 27:00.576
Did you know that Will McAvoy
didn't know that you were hired as EP

27:00.661 --> 27:02.495
and that he's at his agent's office right now?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.831
I didn't know that when the day began,
but I know it now.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.624
I quit my job for this, Mac,

27:06.709 --> 27:08.793
and so did the three other people
you told me to bring.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.420
Our show was canceled,
so we were out of work anyway.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.796
I was offered any other show I wanted at CNN.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.631
- I know, but I wasn't.
- That's not the point.

27:13.716 --> 27:14.841
Excuse me.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.969
It's aggravating when you rise to a position
of, you know, a certain position of...

27:18.053 --> 27:19.929
I put down first and last month's rent.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.098
- Do I have a job in New York?
- Yes, of course you do.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.516
- You're sure?
- No.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.310
I'm calling Tom Walton and begging for a job.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.602
- I'll cover hurricanes.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.647
What? And why didn't you tell me there's
some kind of problem with you and Will?

27:29.732 --> 27:32.775
Because that's personal.
Do you see me asking personal questions?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.527
Now, when was the last time
you were in love with a woman?

27:34.611 --> 27:35.820
- What?
- When was the last time

27:35.904 --> 27:37.572
you had a passionate
relationship with a woman?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.282
Like Hollywood love, high school love?

27:39.366 --> 27:40.825
You know the only reason
I'm still standing here

27:40.909 --> 27:41.993
is that I have nowhere else to go, right?

27:42.077 --> 27:43.578
I do know that. When was the last time?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.788
- Never. That's never happened.
- Right.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.248
And you know
how you've always had a crush on me?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.333
I have never had a crush on you.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.043
You've always had a little crush on me.
It's been cute.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.377
Never had a crush on you, but go ahead.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.212
The girl you just met, Maggie,

27:53.297 --> 27:56.549
she's me before I grew into myself
and got hotter with age.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.843
I don't understand why
you chose this moment to lose it!

27:58.927 --> 28:00.887
- Just...
- Why are you afraid to see Will McAvoy?

28:00.971 --> 28:03.431
- You have to tell me.
- Hey, jughead, I ain't afraid of nothing

28:03.515 --> 28:05.224
except jellyfish, which is completely normal.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.894
- Now look at the girl. Not a big look, stupid.
- I didn't look at all.

28:07.978 --> 28:11.022
You're right. Okay, just glance over.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.610
Cupid, bam!

28:16.945 --> 28:19.781
Can we cut to the chase?
What's in this for you?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.741
Now why does it have to be like that?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.117
It doesn't, but it is.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.828
I need Don Keefer to help me
through this transition.

28:25.913 --> 28:29.082
It turns out Don's dating Maggie,
and I'm not sure he's right for her.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.876
Really? After knowing them
as a couple for this long, you're not sure?

28:31.960 --> 28:33.544
He's going to be threatened by you,

28:33.629 --> 28:35.713
so he'll try to impress Maggie,
who's staying with Will.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.382
- You understand?
- Yeah, I'm calling Walton.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.926
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
- What?

28:43.305 --> 28:44.472
You're right.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.477
You've done enough.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.731
You've done everything
I've ever asked you to do

28:53.816 --> 28:55.983
and a ton of stuff I'd never ask anyone to do.

28:59.655 --> 29:02.240
Tell me where you want to work,
and I'll make the call.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.908
- Look...
- Fly away, little bird.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.619
- Jesus. You know what...
- Something great is about to happen here,

29:06.703 --> 29:08.079
and you're gonna want to be a part of it.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.997
Tell me what the problem is with you and Will.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.374
I can't.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.379
Put the phone away.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.717
This is a solid promise,
we're going to do the best news on TV.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.137
- Either that or...
- We'll all be filling out job applications

29:24.221 --> 29:26.973
at Dave and Buster's,
but we'll be doing it together.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.767
Now you just sit here a minute, all right?

29:30.227 --> 29:31.436
Sure.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.062
- Do you know how to flirt?
- Yes.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.272
Show me.

29:35.149 --> 29:36.190
Hi.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.986
Okay, just sit here. We're gonna be great!

29:40.070 --> 29:42.363
- Where's the rest of the staff?
- They left.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.004
Hi, Will. It's good to see you.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.093
This is Jim Harper, my senior producer.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.803
- The others are coming up...
- Let's go in my office.

30:05.888 --> 30:06.929
Sure.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.015
Somebody wanna tell Don
the lunch party's over,

30:09.099 --> 30:10.558
and I need someone on the assignment desk

30:10.642 --> 30:13.019
in case there happens to be,
what do you call it, news?

30:13.562 --> 30:15.062
Can I get you some coffee or anything?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.106
- Water or maybe...
- We're fine.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.289
I tried to get in touch with you
while you were on vacation.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.999
Nobody seemed to know how to do that.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.793
Or at least they weren't willing to say.

30:42.925 --> 30:46.552
Actually, I've tried to get in touch with you
a lot of times in the last three years.

30:46.637 --> 30:47.762
Did you get all those e-mails?

30:47.846 --> 30:48.930
- Yeah.
- What did you think?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.431
I didn't read them.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.601
I understand. There's no need to apologize.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.771
Thank you.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.033
You look good after your vacation.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.244
You look rested.
I've never been to Saint Lucia.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.453
- Is it great?
- Yeah.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.622
You were down there with Erin Andrews?
It's not my business.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.791
You can go anywhere with anyone.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.960
Thank you again.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.632
Hey, this can work.
In fact, it's gonna work great.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.176
I asked my agent to negotiate
a three-year contract.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.053
You know me,
I think that's the longest contract...

31:29.137 --> 31:31.055
It's not a three-year contract anymore.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.433
- I'm sorry?
- It's not a three-year contract anymore.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.979
It's a 156-week contract
that gives me the opportunity

31:38.063 --> 31:41.732
to fire you 155 times at the end of each week.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.901
We'll wait a few months
to make sure it's not a story

31:43.986 --> 31:46.571
Bill Carter can shove up my ass.
We'll do it, then.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.906
How did you get my contract changed?

31:48.991 --> 31:51.200
I gave the network back
some money off my salary.

31:51.285 --> 31:53.244
- How much money?
- A million dollars a year.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.246
- You gave back a million dollars a year?
- Yeah.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.790
You paid a million dollars
to be able to fire me any time you want?

31:57.874 --> 32:01.168
$3 million. And not any time I want,
just the end of each week.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.674
How the hell much money do you get paid?

32:07.551 --> 32:09.218
- Don?
- Speaking.

32:09.303 --> 32:12.221
You should meet James Harper,
MacKenzie's senior producer.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.223
- Jim.
- Were you with MacKenzie in Afghanistan?

32:14.308 --> 32:16.767
Yeah. And Iraq.

32:16.852 --> 32:21.188
And sometimes when you're in Afghanistan,
it turns out you're really in Pakistan.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.941
- Twenty-six months.
- You ever produce from the studio?

32:24.026 --> 32:26.652
For about a year in Atlanta
before MacKenzie took me out.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.571
- She's crazy, you know.
- I know.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.865
I've never seen anyone love
being an American so much.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.992
And when you factor in
she isn't an American, it's all very...

32:33.076 --> 32:35.119
Yeah, she is American, actually.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.623
Her dad was Margaret Thatcher's
ambassador to the UN and she was born here.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.790
Yeah, and immediately locked in her room

32:39.875 --> 32:41.751
and shown Frank Capra movies
until she was 21.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.378
She's like a sophomore
poli-sci major at Sarah Lawrence.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.881
Exactly like that. Yeah.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.050
I guess the only real differences
are her two Peabodys

32:49.134 --> 32:51.135
and the scar on her stomach
from the knife wound she got

32:51.219 --> 32:53.638
covering a Shiite protest in Islamabad.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.141
Welcome.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.768
I'm just taking your temperature.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.936
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much trouble am I in with you?

33:01.021 --> 33:02.480
I'm over it.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.774
Hey, do this to me.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.526
Do this to me all you want,
but you can't do it to them.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.528
- Who?
- People followed me here...

33:09.613 --> 33:13.783
Jim Harper, my senior producer, bookers,
H&A producer, desk editors, field producers...

33:13.867 --> 33:16.327
- They can't possibly be my problem.
- Will, come on now.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.662
What do you want from me, MacKenzie?

33:17.746 --> 33:20.665
They're in the process of moving.
They've put down security deposits.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.625
They found roommates.
They're looking at preschools...

33:22.709 --> 33:25.961
Yeah, they fucked up, Mac! They trusted you!

33:42.187 --> 33:43.729
You've got a news alert.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.820
Pardon me, Don.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.822
You've got a news alert.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.912
It's yellow.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.142
There's been an explosion
off the coast of Louisiana.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.770
How can there be an explosion
in the middle of the water?

34:24.855 --> 34:26.522
- An oil rig.
- An oil rig.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.821
"Well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico."

34:37.159 --> 34:39.744
All right, Tess, get on the assignment desk
and see if this goes anywhere.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.078
Okay.

34:42.038 --> 34:45.791
"Flames reach 150 feet in the air."

34:49.004 --> 34:51.756
If you had read any of my e-mails
or answered my calls,

34:51.840 --> 34:55.426
you'd know that I take responsibility
for everything and...

34:55.510 --> 34:57.636
I already did know that,
and I already didn't care.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.346
That I'm sorry.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.015
- Are you?
- Yes.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.603
MacKenzie, I...

35:06.188 --> 35:10.441
I just, you have no idea how I've longed
to hear those words. I...

35:11.902 --> 35:13.611
I forgive you. Can you forgive...

35:13.695 --> 35:16.197
- You're being sarcastic.
- Oh, how you know me.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.240
"Emergency rescue crews
arrive on location

35:18.325 --> 35:23.120
"at burning well located 50 miles offshore.
Twelve to 15 people believed missing."

35:23.205 --> 35:25.039
- It's still yellow.
- Still yellow.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.542
Don, they just haven't changed the color yet.
Somebody should tell Will or at least...

35:28.627 --> 35:33.214
I'm not knocking on Will's door right now,
and you don't work here yet.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.966
- So, dude, relax. Anything new?
- No.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.635
- There might be.
- There won't be.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.929
An oil rig in the Gulf exploded.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.680
- Persian Gulf?
- No, the Gulf of Mexico.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.308
- Kendra.
- BP Deepwater Horizon.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.811
It's about 50 miles southeast
of Venice, Louisiana.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.147
The Coast Guard evacuated seven people,
all of them critically injured,

35:50.232 --> 35:51.857
and they're searching
for 11 confirmed missing.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.025
Still yellow.

35:53.109 --> 35:57.446
Isn't it possible that AP's busy right now,
and they've got an intern on the updates?

35:57.531 --> 35:59.448
They may have bigger problems
than the missing crew.

35:59.533 --> 36:02.451
What do you mean? What do you mean
bigger problems than the missing crew?

36:02.536 --> 36:05.704
Hang on! Hang on! Listen to what he said.

36:06.706 --> 36:07.957
What did you say?

36:08.124 --> 36:10.751
I said they may have bigger problems
than the missing crew.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.002
Why?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.921
I checked out BP Deepwater Horizon.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.757
That rig is drilling
at 18,000 feet below sea level.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.467
There are only a couple of things
that could have failed.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.219
- And if it was the wrong one...
- Pressure.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.763
It would be like trying to toss a hat
on a fire hose.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.931
What the hell are you two talking about?

36:24.057 --> 36:25.224
It's more than 11 missing guys.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.644
There might be a massive oil spill
50 miles off the coast of Louisiana.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.188
- I'm sorry, man. Tell me who you are again.
- I'm Jim Harper.

36:31.273 --> 36:34.024
And I may or may not be, but almost
definitely won't be a senior producer here

36:34.109 --> 36:37.695
under MacKenzie if she still has a job, which
sounds like she probably absolutely doesn't.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.655
Okay, well, whatever it is
doesn't start for two weeks,

36:39.739 --> 36:41.031
so you're still in my newsroom,

36:41.116 --> 36:43.117
and you're behaving in a way
that is bothering me.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.119
- Gotta be blunt.
- Got it.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.705
The truck in Pasadena,
they're five blocks from the courthouse.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.206
Are they covering the Rose Bowl?

36:49.291 --> 36:51.458
And I cannot look
at the same loop of people...

36:51.543 --> 36:53.252
This is Jim Harper.

36:54.588 --> 36:55.796
All right.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.306
For the moment,
your people can have their jobs.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.475
Like I said, I have to wait to make the move
because there was a press release.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.104
But when I hire the new EP,
who I will hire by hiring them myself,

37:12.188 --> 37:14.732
whoever it is, is going
to get to interview the new people.

37:14.900 --> 37:15.983
All right.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.320
Well, I appreciate that.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.740
They're really good, Will.
You're gonna want to keep them.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.034
- Don't just dump them because of...
- They'll get a fair chance.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.453
- Okay.
- I haven't started my script.

37:28.455 --> 37:29.997
I'll get out of your way.

37:41.343 --> 37:43.093
There's nothing
that's more important in a democracy

37:43.178 --> 37:44.678
than a well-informed electorate.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.722
You know you're still on this side of the door.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.266
When there's no information
or, much worse, wrong information,

37:49.351 --> 37:52.937
it can lead to calamitous decisions
and clobber any attempts at vigorous debate.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.773
- That's why I produce the news.
- We're all grateful to you.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.733
- You're spinning out of control.
- No, I'm not.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.443
You're terrified
you're going to lose your audience,

37:59.527 --> 38:00.945
and you'd do anything to get them back.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.739
You're one pitch meeting away
from doing the news in 3-D.

38:03.823 --> 38:07.117
This isn't nonprofit theater.
It's advertiser-supported television.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.536
- You know that, right?
- I'd rather do a good show for 100 people

38:09.621 --> 38:11.747
than a bad one for a million,
if that's what you're saying.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.666
What is it you're talking
to me about right now?

38:13.750 --> 38:17.378
I've come here to produce a news broadcast
that more closely resembles the one we did

38:17.462 --> 38:21.715
before you got popular
by not bothering anyone, Leno.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.135
I think Jay and I would rather be employed
if it's all the same to you.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.222
It's not all the same to me, you punk.

38:28.473 --> 38:33.560
I've come here to take your IQ and your talent
and put it to some patriotic fucking use.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.980
And where does it say
that a good news show can't be popular?

38:36.064 --> 38:38.148
- Nielsen ratings.
- We're going to do a good news show

38:38.233 --> 38:39.900
and make it popular at the same time.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.860
- That is impossible.
- Between your brains,

38:41.945 --> 38:45.489
- charm, looks, and affability and my...
- Refusal to live in reality.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.158
...expertise in producing you... Ugh!
- It's impossible, Mac!

38:48.243 --> 38:52.079
Social scientists have concluded
that the country is more polarized

38:52.163 --> 38:56.083
than at any time since the Civil War.
The Civil War.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.918
Yes, people choose the news
they want now, but...

38:58.003 --> 39:00.754
People choose the facts they want now.

39:00.922 --> 39:03.590
So what you've just described is impossible.

39:03.675 --> 39:07.678
Only if you think an overwhelming majority
of Americans are preternaturally stupid.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.013
- I do.
- I don't.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.265
And if you let me, I can prove it.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.351
You know what you left out of your sermon?

39:14.436 --> 39:17.604
That America is the only country
on the planet that, since its birth,

39:17.689 --> 39:21.608
has said over and over and over
that we can do better.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.777
It's part of our DNA.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.114
People will want the news
if you give it to them with integrity.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.117
Not everybody, not even a lot of people, 5%.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.829
And 5% more of anything
is what makes the difference in this country.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.290
So we can do better.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.421
What?

39:42.797 --> 39:44.298
I'm thinking.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.304
Yeah, that whole speech did nothing for me.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.484
- I'd like to talk to Don.
- Are you sure?

40:05.570 --> 40:07.196
Right there.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.408
Excuse me.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.410
I don't mind if you sit
somewhere and observe,

40:13.495 --> 40:15.537
but I mind you doing anything else.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.706
You got it, but I just got a call from a source.

40:18.458 --> 40:19.750
What kind of source?

40:19.834 --> 40:22.461
I can't tell you much except that
he's an engineer with BP in London.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.547
He says he's sitting in meetings
where they don't know how to cap the well.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.717
- Who's the source?
- Can't tell you.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.678
- Anything else?
- A lot.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.430
I got two pages of notes
from my conversation with...

40:33.515 --> 40:36.016
- Oh, great.
- Okay. Yeah.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.902
Thanks for calling back.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.285
Yeah.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.454
Now I'd like you
to listen to these words

40:57.539 --> 41:01.041
which were written 500 years ago
by Don Miguel de Cervantes,

41:02.377 --> 41:05.629
"Hear me now, O thou bleak
and unbearable world.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.632
"Thou art base and debauched as can be.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.636
"But a knight with his banners
all bravely unfurled

41:12.720 --> 41:15.764
"now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!"

41:18.977 --> 41:20.519
That was Don Quixote.

41:22.480 --> 41:26.608
Those words were written 45 years ago
by the lyricist for Man of La Mancha.

41:26.693 --> 41:27.818
Didn't think you'd know that,

41:27.902 --> 41:29.862
but the point's still the same,
it's time for Don Quixote!

41:29.946 --> 41:32.739
- You think I'm him?
- No, I think I'm him. You're his horse.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.033
- He rode a donkey.
- Well, I can't help you there.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.202
- I have to write my script.
- I'll write it for you.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.247
"The volcanic eruption in Iceland
is believed to have started on March 20th

41:40.331 --> 41:42.708
"and has led to a worldwide
transportation disaster.

41:42.792 --> 41:46.086
"The suspension of air traffic was in no way
caused by America, which I love.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.754
"You have to believe me."

41:47.839 --> 41:49.882
You want me in the same shouting match
as everybody else?

41:49.966 --> 41:52.009
I want you to not apologize
for saying something...

41:52.093 --> 41:53.260
All right!

41:53.553 --> 41:55.137
You got yourself in the shouting match

41:55.221 --> 41:57.723
when you took vertigo meds
and I'd have you winning it.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.266
And what does winning look like to you?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.810
Reclaiming the Fourth Estate,

42:01.895 --> 42:05.397
reclaiming journalism
as an honorable profession,

42:05.481 --> 42:10.694
a nightly newscast that informs a debate
worthy of a great nation,

42:10.778 --> 42:14.198
civility, respect,
and a return to what's important,

42:14.282 --> 42:17.534
the death of bitchiness,
the death of gossip and voyeurism,

42:17.619 --> 42:21.038
speaking truth to stupid,
no demographic sweet spot,

42:21.122 --> 42:23.790
a place where we all come together.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.795
We're coming to a tipping point.
I know you know that.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.131
There's gonna be a huge conversation.

42:31.216 --> 42:35.594
Is government an instrument of good
or is it every man for himself?

42:36.137 --> 42:38.263
Is there something bigger
we want to reach for

42:38.348 --> 42:41.058
or is self-interest our basic resting pulse?

42:42.143 --> 42:44.353
You and I have a chance
to be among the few people

42:44.437 --> 42:46.730
who can frame that debate.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.442
That's, it's...

42:50.818 --> 42:52.152
Quixotic?

42:53.488 --> 42:56.156
- Don.
- Jesus Christ, we're on it, okay, Jimmy Olsen?

42:56.241 --> 42:58.784
Listen, we've got 55 seconds for a phoner
with the Coast Guard liaison.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.911
That's not nearly enough,
and you're chasing the wrong story.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.037
Oh, brother.

43:02.121 --> 43:04.748
Listen, Halliburton was the contractor
on this special type of concrete...

43:04.832 --> 43:06.959
Seriously, you're being disruptive now.

43:09.712 --> 43:11.296
Hey, how happy is Charlie Skinner gonna be

43:11.381 --> 43:13.924
when I phone this over to CBS
and he finds out you had it first?

43:14.008 --> 43:15.592
All right, that's it. Get the fuck out.

43:15.677 --> 43:18.136
Okay. You're right.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.681
Elevator's this way?

43:24.769 --> 43:26.812
God damn it.

43:26.896 --> 43:27.896
What?

43:27.981 --> 43:29.815
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to Mac for just a second?

43:29.899 --> 43:31.108
Your guy here is a pain in the ass.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.110
An oil well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.945
The Coast Guard's searching
for missing crew members.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.780
- I'll fill you in at the 6:00 rundown.
- There's more.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.907
- He doesn't need to hear this right now.
- Let's go outside.

43:38.992 --> 43:40.742
No, if Don doesn't want me to hear it,
I'd like to hear it.

43:40.827 --> 43:41.868
Oh, blow me.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.829
I want you to not use
that language in front of women

43:43.913 --> 43:46.081
and to forever not suggest that image to me.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.249
What's on your mind? Who are you?

43:47.333 --> 43:49.584
- Jim Harper, my senior producer.
- Senior?

43:49.669 --> 43:51.670
- Is he old enough to drive at night?
- What happened?

43:51.754 --> 43:53.422
Two calls within five minutes of each other.

43:53.506 --> 43:55.716
The first one was from a friend of mine
at BP in London saying

43:55.800 --> 43:58.343
he's sitting in meetings
where they don't know how to cap the well.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.095
- Jesus.
- The oil is still spilling?

44:00.179 --> 44:01.680
Yeah, at a pretty alarming rate.

44:01.764 --> 44:04.641
The first estimate was
about 10,000 gallons an hour.

44:04.726 --> 44:07.185
My guy says it's closer to 100,000

44:07.270 --> 44:08.812
and could get as high
as a quarter of a million.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.564
Why is this well different from other wells?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.441
The depth.

44:12.525 --> 44:15.819
I need one of your staffers.
I don't know his name.

44:15.903 --> 44:18.613
He sits in the back. He's the one with...

44:18.698 --> 44:21.199
Are you trying to say
the Indian stereotype of an IT guy?

44:21.284 --> 44:23.076
- Yes.
- Punjab!

44:23.161 --> 44:24.995
- I don't think that's his name.
- Why not?

44:25.079 --> 44:26.872
Punjab's a character
from Little Orphan Annie.

44:26.956 --> 44:28.248
Tell him about the pressure.

44:28.374 --> 44:33.462
Uh, Deepwater Horizon is aptly named.
They're drilling at 18,000 feet below sea level.

44:33.546 --> 44:34.588
Is that dangerous?

44:34.672 --> 44:36.590
Take the Grand Canyon,
make it three times deeper,

44:36.674 --> 44:39.009
fill it with water,
and poke a hole in the bottom.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.636
You can't just yank the pin out of the planet,
and that's what's happened.

44:41.721 --> 44:43.430
How do you know all this? You're the IT guy.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.183
- I'm not the IT guy. I write your blog.
- Are you kidding?

44:46.267 --> 44:48.060
I think we're in the first hours
of a serious story.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.520
- No. I have a blog?
- Not the time.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.105
How do you know this stuff?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.816
I made a volcano in primary school.

44:54.901 --> 44:57.235
So did I. I didn't know I was supposed
to learn something from it.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.196
- What was the second call?
- My guy at Halliburton.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.864
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing, Charlie.

45:00.948 --> 45:03.575
- Can we please get back to work?
- A rig exploded in the Gulf?

45:03.659 --> 45:04.701
It's yellow.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.828
Not anymore. It just got bumped up to orange.

45:06.913 --> 45:07.871
It's orange.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.956
Okay, the rig was due
to be moved to its next role

45:10.041 --> 45:12.459
as a semi-permanent production platform
at a new location,

45:12.543 --> 45:14.795
and Halliburton was hired to seal
the well with cement.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.213
- Who are you?
- Jack something.

45:16.297 --> 45:19.007
It's Jim something,
and both of my guys are identifying

45:19.092 --> 45:21.468
the failure of the cement's mix
as the cause of the explosion.

45:21.594 --> 45:26.390
But here's the thing, Halliburton performed
tests on the cement mix,

45:26.474 --> 45:28.392
and the tests showed it was gonna fail.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.602
- Holy Mother.
- Yeah, hang on, Holy Mother.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.104
I need to know who your sources are.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.732
Hey, I don't know you, Scooter.

45:35.817 --> 45:40.153
Look, you don't have to trust me.
She trusts me. You just have to trust her.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.740
Try another strategy.
How high up is the guy at BP?

45:43.825 --> 45:46.118
High enough to be in on the meetings,
and I never said it was a guy.

45:46.202 --> 45:48.078
Actually, you did.
Does he have an axe to grind?

45:48.162 --> 45:49.871
- No.
- What about the guy at Halliburton?

45:49.956 --> 45:52.457
I didn't say he was a guy,
but we'll call him that.

45:52.834 --> 45:55.794
And he is solid.
You guys have to follow up on this, all right?

45:55.878 --> 45:57.838
You're gonna wanna open
with the Coast Guard search

45:57.922 --> 45:59.965
and then pivot to this because...

46:00.049 --> 46:01.425
- Neal.
- Neal says...

46:01.509 --> 46:03.552
It's gonna be the biggest
environmental disaster in history.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.470
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

46:05.555 --> 46:07.973
Can we please get back to work
and send the Hardy Boys to their room?

46:08.057 --> 46:09.099
Neal, tell them.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.726
After an explosion like that,
the first thing that's supposed to happen

46:11.811 --> 46:14.813
is the underwater blowout preventer
should automatically close.

46:14.897 --> 46:19.025
The flames are still 150 feet high,
so that obviously didn't happen.

46:19.235 --> 46:20.444
Now when they get the fire out,

46:20.528 --> 46:23.488
they're gonna send a submersible ROV
down there to turn the preventer on manually,

46:23.573 --> 46:27.367
but my source says,
"At that depth with that much pressure,

46:27.452 --> 46:30.328
"it has to be the mechanics
that failed and not the electronics."

46:30.413 --> 46:33.039
In other words,
trying it manually isn't gonna work either.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.876
So they're gonna have to build relief wells
and that's gonna take months.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.963
Months of oil spilling into the Gulf
at a rate of 4.2 million gallons a day.

46:40.047 --> 46:45.385
And just for the record, the Gulf of Mexico
contains 643 quadrillion gallons of water.

46:45.470 --> 46:46.678
I think you may be overreacting.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.180
You are dramatically underreacting.

46:48.264 --> 46:49.973
I'm the only one who's not
dramatically doing anything.

46:50.057 --> 46:53.477
In four days, it'll have spilled as much oil
as the Exxon Valdez.

46:53.561 --> 46:56.104
It's a week before the oil
reaches Louisiana shores,

46:56.189 --> 46:57.481
three days if the wind shifts.

46:57.565 --> 46:58.648
Is the wind gonna shift?

46:58.733 --> 47:00.734
Only if Louisiana's luck
stays exactly the same.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.403
You've gotta tell him your sources.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.114
I can't.

47:06.199 --> 47:08.742
He can't trust you unless you trust him.

47:13.247 --> 47:16.208
All right, the necessary people
go into my office, close the door.

47:16.292 --> 47:18.668
- I want Mac as a witness.
- Fine.

47:24.592 --> 47:28.428
The BP engineer is my college roommate.
He's a junior VP. He's been there a year.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.348
And how do I know you're not
being fed misinformation by James O'Keefe

47:31.432 --> 47:33.600
in the hope that I run with it
and make his day?

47:33.684 --> 47:35.393
Who's your Halliburton guy?

47:39.357 --> 47:40.607
My big sister.

47:41.025 --> 47:44.110
She's got a PhD in mechanical engineering,
and she voted for McCain.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.030
You're telling me you got not one
but two people to roll over

47:47.114 --> 47:49.032
on their employers within five minutes?

47:49.116 --> 47:50.659
I know, it's just lucky.

47:50.743 --> 47:53.119
- How often do you get this lucky?
- This is my first time.

47:53.204 --> 47:57.707
Um... It's a search and rescue operation
in which no one is going to be rescued

47:57.792 --> 48:00.126
because Michael Phelps
with an outboard motor on his ass

48:00.211 --> 48:03.630
couldn't out-swim that fire,
and you're letting a guy who you just met

48:03.714 --> 48:07.050
and a woman who, I don't know what the hell,
spin this into the end of the world.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.885
But forget that.

48:08.970 --> 48:12.764
If you're wrong about Halliburton,
that's the first line of your bio forever.

48:12.848 --> 48:15.600
"Isn't this the same guy
who said that Halliburton caused that spill?"

48:15.685 --> 48:18.645
And, by the way, you publically accuse them
of negligent homicide

48:18.729 --> 48:21.064
and you're wrong, they will take you to court.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.900
They will win
and they will end up owning AWM.

48:23.985 --> 48:27.529
They will have their own record label.
They will have theme parks.

48:34.954 --> 48:36.288
Let's throw out the rundown.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.540
- Attaboy.
- This is out of control.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.750
We're throwing out the rundown.

48:40.835 --> 48:43.420
Gary, see if you can get me a spokesman
from BP on the phone.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.255
- Get me anything...
- Where are you going?

48:45.339 --> 48:46.965
I was told to put together a new show.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.758
Guys, can I have your attention?

48:48.843 --> 48:53.888
I'm sorry if I've been a little inaccessible
or terse lately or for several years,

48:53.973 --> 48:57.350
but if I could just see a show of hands,
who's going with Don to 10:00?

49:05.735 --> 49:07.444
All right, I appreciate all the hard work.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.820
And as a token of that appreciation,

49:08.904 --> 49:11.698
I'm giving you guys two weeks' paid vacation
starting right now.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.492
Hold on.
You're gonna have her run the show?

49:14.577 --> 49:16.411
- Yeah.
- Don't do this, Will.

49:16.495 --> 49:18.747
I just offered her
the most humiliating contract

49:18.831 --> 49:20.290
since Antonio got a loan from Shylock.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.042
She took it.
I don't know what that is, but I like it.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.835
You're gonna do a full hour
on an environmental story,

49:23.919 --> 49:26.755
and you don't wanna at least wait until
there's film of an oil-covered pelican?

49:26.839 --> 49:28.423
It's not just an environmental story.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.133
Everywhere I look,
people are dressed up in costume,

49:30.217 --> 49:32.093
screaming about how bad government is.

49:32.178 --> 49:33.386
What's your position?

49:33.471 --> 49:34.846
That people should know
what they're screaming about.

49:34.930 --> 49:35.930
Are you ready to go on television and say

49:36.015 --> 49:38.975
that this well wouldn't have blown up
if there had been more government oversight?

49:39.060 --> 49:40.435
I'll give you my next paycheck
if it doesn't turn out

49:40.519 --> 49:43.563
that some department was defunded
or some industry was deregulated.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.273
He'll do it, too.

49:47.568 --> 49:49.653
I didn't buy any of that bullshit
you said in my office,

49:49.737 --> 49:51.321
but can you start two weeks early?

49:51.405 --> 49:52.989
You plainly bought it a lot, and yes.

49:53.074 --> 49:55.158
- I didn't buy it at all, and go.
- Okay.

49:55.242 --> 49:57.494
But it's obvious now
that you ate it up with a soup ladle.

49:57.578 --> 49:59.245
- Just go.
- Who's my booker?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.247
- Right here.
- Jim's gonna tell you who to line up.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.291
Everybody out who doesn't need to be here.

50:03.376 --> 50:04.709
Wait!

50:06.587 --> 50:08.004
Seriously, though, I have a blog?

50:08.089 --> 50:09.964
- Now!
- Yeah. It's Gary Cooper from News Night.

50:10.883 --> 50:13.385
I'm good. I need to speak to someone
about recent legislation.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.345
You go out around 8:20.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.597
We could send a crew and do that
right from the Coast Guard station.

50:17.682 --> 50:20.475
Hello, this is Jim Harper. I'm the senior
producer with News Night on Atlantis,

50:20.559 --> 50:22.727
and we're looking into a story
about the BP Deepwater Horizon rig

50:22.812 --> 50:24.020
that just exploded in the Gulf.

50:24.105 --> 50:25.313
This is Margaret Jordan from News Night.

50:25.398 --> 50:27.190
We're looking for someone
from the EPA to comment

50:27.274 --> 50:29.025
on the explosion at Deepwater Horizon.

50:29.110 --> 50:31.528
Take him to our studio in New Orleans.

50:31.612 --> 50:34.197
I'm so sorry. Can I put you on hold? Okay.

50:34.657 --> 50:38.410
Hi, Mike. It's Tess Westin from News Night.
We're doing a whole hour on the explosion.

50:38.494 --> 50:40.203
I really need your input on this.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.997
You're on speaker with me,
MacKenzie McHale and...

50:43.082 --> 50:44.541
- Jim Harper.
- Jim Harper.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.710
- Margaret. Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

50:46.794 --> 50:50.380
There's a government agency called the MMA,
the Minerals Management Agency.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.090
They have some kind
of oversight over offshore drilling.

50:52.174 --> 50:53.216
I don't know anything about them.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.551
- Can you write me a short memo?
- Sure.

50:54.635 --> 50:55.802
- I'll do it.
- I can do it.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.221
You're not the only one with loyalty.
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

50:58.305 --> 50:59.848
- I can do this.
- Can you do this?

50:59.932 --> 51:01.057
You can't just look it up on Wikipedia.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.475
- He's right.
- I wasn't going to.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.727
She's Will's assistant.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.520
- I'm an associate producer.
- Since when?

51:05.604 --> 51:06.771
- About two hours ago.
- That's great.

51:06.856 --> 51:08.106
And you're wasting my time.

51:08.190 --> 51:11.234
You guys duke it out over who my boss is,
but I'd like to get this one thing right.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.777
Knock it out of the park.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.823
I need a geologist.
Don, who's our go-to geologist?

51:16.907 --> 51:20.910
Our go-to geologist?
There's not a lot of breaking news in geology.

51:20.995 --> 51:24.873
Dr. James Morris at MIT
and Dr. Marvin Hasbrook at Stanford.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.541
Whoever answers the phone first.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.462
Is the EPA ready to comment?

51:30.546 --> 51:32.338
We're waiting for a comment from BP.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.384
Are you able to get the White House
on the phone?

51:36.469 --> 51:38.178
- Yeah.
- Then do it.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.346
Halliburton is in it, Sean. That ship has sailed.

51:40.431 --> 51:43.600
Studio 1-A, this is Broadcast Center.
You're up on router 3.

51:43.684 --> 51:44.934
Copy that, Center. Router 3.

51:45.019 --> 51:47.854
No, throw out all the remotes.
It's a whole new rundown.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.425
Thank you.

52:36.445 --> 52:39.572
Joey, these three are confirmed,
but you should build all five.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.449
Got it.

52:50.125 --> 52:53.169
Will, we've confirmed these three guests.
We're waiting on two others.

53:03.097 --> 53:04.180
Two minutes.

53:04.265 --> 53:05.640
Who's our wardrobe supervisor?

53:05.724 --> 53:07.183
- We don't have one.
- Get one.

53:07.268 --> 53:11.688
Charcoal gray, navy blue, and black.
Zegna, Armani, Hugo Boss.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.439
He's not gonna look like
an elite Northeastern prick?

53:13.524 --> 53:15.567
He is. Let's make that sexy again.

53:15.651 --> 53:16.860
Was it ever sexy?

53:16.944 --> 53:18.862
Ask the Kennedy brothers. Oh, Will?

53:18.946 --> 53:20.822
Don't talk to me
unless you absolutely have to, all right?

53:20.906 --> 53:21.990
I absolutely have to.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.409
I thought this would be a good time
to get a couple of things straight.

53:24.493 --> 53:25.535
I'm on TV in 90 seconds.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.871
I don't think this is a good time
to get a couple of things straight.

53:27.955 --> 53:31.040
That's funny, because I think it's the best time
to get a couple of things straight.

53:31.125 --> 53:32.083
Can people hear me in there?

53:32.167 --> 53:33.710
Not yet. Now they can.

53:33.794 --> 53:35.211
Take me off.

53:35.296 --> 53:38.506
So I did a terrible thing
and I don't expect you to forgive me.

53:38.591 --> 53:39.549
Take me off.

53:39.633 --> 53:41.301
You've got my contract,
but the thing you have to know

53:41.385 --> 53:44.721
is that between 8:00 and 9:00,
you are completely mine.

53:44.805 --> 53:47.432
For an hour, five times a week I own you.

53:47.516 --> 53:51.060
But in my case,
it's for your own good and for the good of all.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.646
Say "I understand" so I can
get these guys a sound level.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.148
I don't see it working that way.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.816
- You don't?
- No.

53:57.276 --> 53:58.443
Okay.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.362
- Where's my graphics producer?
- Right here.

54:01.822 --> 54:02.906
I'm MacKenzie. What's your name?

54:02.990 --> 54:04.574
- Sixty seconds.
- Jo... Joey.

54:04.658 --> 54:05.909
Can I get some quiet?

54:05.993 --> 54:07.827
Joey, could I have your seat
for just a second?

54:07.912 --> 54:09.412
Yes, ma'am.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.752
There you go. Show that to Will, please.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.170
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.172
Will, check out your preview screen.

54:23.135 --> 54:24.218
Get it off there!

54:24.303 --> 54:26.054
- Say you understand.
- Thirty seconds.

54:26.138 --> 54:28.890
Someone's gonna spill coffee on a button
and broadcast that thing. Get it off.

54:28.974 --> 54:31.684
I've got a one-week contract.
I don't have a lot to lose.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.062
I'm just glad nobody's invented a way
to digitally store images

54:34.146 --> 54:36.105
and upload them onto a free website
where anyone can see them.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.232
Has someone invented a way
to digitally store images?

54:38.317 --> 54:39.609
YouTube! YouTube!

54:39.693 --> 54:42.278
Now you're just the crazy guy
shouting "YouTube!"

54:42.363 --> 54:44.155
- Oh, God...
- Just say you understand.

54:44.239 --> 54:46.157
- I understand!
- Good!

54:47.034 --> 54:48.785
You warmed up?
You wanna screw around some more?

54:48.869 --> 54:50.203
- I'm good!
- Ten.

54:50.496 --> 54:52.372
There's no script.
There's nothing on the prompter.

54:52.456 --> 54:54.457
Nothing on the prompter
is where this man eats.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.042
And rolling.

55:00.965 --> 55:02.548
Stand by, Joe.

55:09.515 --> 55:11.349
Stand by, Camera 1.

55:13.644 --> 55:15.353
Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy.

55:15.437 --> 55:17.647
Breaking news tonight
in what could be the biggest disaster

55:17.731 --> 55:19.983
to hit the Gulf of Mexico
since Hurricane Katrina

55:20.067 --> 55:22.860
and the biggest environmental catastrophe
to stain our shores

55:22.945 --> 55:25.113
since the crash of the Exxon Valdez.

55:25.197 --> 55:28.074
An oil rig in the Gulf,
British Petroleum's Deepwater Horizon,

55:28.158 --> 55:30.326
50 miles off Venice, Louisiana,

55:30.411 --> 55:34.038
exploded into flames
shortly after 2:00 p.m. Eastern time.

55:34.123 --> 55:36.833
Seven crew members
have been evacuated to an area hospital

55:36.917 --> 55:38.835
where they remain in critical condition,

55:38.919 --> 55:41.921
and the Coast Guard is in the fifth hour
of a search and rescue mission,

55:42.006 --> 55:45.049
in the hope of finding
11 crew members still unaccounted for.

55:45.134 --> 55:47.010
Our coverage begins with Sherrie Stone

55:47.094 --> 55:49.095
at the US Coast Guard station
in Baton Rouge.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.597
- Sherrie?
- Yes, Will, the Coast Guard got...

55:51.682 --> 55:53.016
All right, you'll be coming back

55:53.100 --> 55:56.352
to Rear Admiral Loretta Hill
of the Coast Guard.

55:56.437 --> 55:58.354
Just right after 3:00 p.m. Eastern time...

55:58.439 --> 56:00.690
The missing men may be
only the tip of this tragedy.

56:00.774 --> 56:04.861
ACN has learned exclusively
that senior level officials inside BP

56:04.945 --> 56:07.113
are scrambling to figure out
a way to cap the well,

56:07.197 --> 56:09.824
which, three and a half miles
below the surface of the Gulf,

56:09.908 --> 56:12.368
is pouring oil into the sea
at a rate of 125,000...

56:12.453 --> 56:14.871
I'm sure you'd like to see
some kind of statement on the screen.

56:14.955 --> 56:18.541
"Our thoughts and prayers are with
the families of the missing crew members."

56:18.625 --> 56:21.169
I can help you out with that,
but I'll also need a statement

56:21.253 --> 56:24.213
that says at this hour
you don't know how to cap the well.

56:24.298 --> 56:25.798
You have about 25 minutes.

56:28.427 --> 56:31.054
Dr. Morris, this is New York.
Can you hear me? Good.

56:31.138 --> 56:33.723
We'll be coming to you in about two minutes.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.850
You've got to ask her
why there's no contingency.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.311
Why is there no contingency?

56:38.395 --> 56:40.730
Nancy, why are we drilling
three miles underwater

56:40.814 --> 56:44.400
when we don't have the technology to fix
the world's most predictable emergency?

56:50.157 --> 56:51.324
Jim.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.492
Jim!

56:53.160 --> 56:56.287
Jim. Jim.

56:56.663 --> 56:58.748
Jim? You have a hold button.

56:58.832 --> 57:00.625
- Hold, please.
-  Jim!

57:03.003 --> 57:04.545
- You got it?
- I...

57:05.339 --> 57:08.424
- Oh, shit.
- I got it and I think a little bit more.

57:10.594 --> 57:11.761
- Come with me.
- Okay.

57:11.845 --> 57:14.263
- Take the pad.
- Thank you.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.974
Dr. James Morris of the US Geological Survey

57:17.059 --> 57:19.852
and Professor of Petroleum Geology at MIT.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.230
BP Deepwater Horizon is engulfed in flames

57:22.314 --> 57:24.816
and the search continues
for 11 missing crew members.

57:24.900 --> 57:26.484
We'll be right back.

57:30.864 --> 57:33.074
When we come back, it'll be Halliburton.
Are you ready?

57:33.158 --> 57:35.493
- No statement from BP?
- Don't worry about BP.

57:35.577 --> 57:39.163
You're going to Halliburton's
spokesperson Dick Warren.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.334
This is beautiful.

57:43.418 --> 57:46.087
Just sitting here, Charlie.
I'm watching the news.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.760
Young lady, get on your Twitter account.

57:53.053 --> 57:55.847
We're doing this whole broadcast on the fly.

57:55.931 --> 57:57.807
Will doesn't have a rundown,

57:57.891 --> 58:00.935
it's the EP's first show,
and she's got the whole thing in her head.

58:01.019 --> 58:03.020
She's the only one who knows
where we're going next.

58:03.105 --> 58:07.608
It's a feat that requires incredible trust
between the anchor and the EP.

58:07.693 --> 58:08.943
Say all that.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.778
I can only use 140 characters.

58:11.780 --> 58:12.947
Figure it out.

58:13.031 --> 58:15.158
- We are trying to gather information...
- Sir, please. Please!

58:15.242 --> 58:17.368
...as quickly as possible.
It isn't easy while we're being hounded.

58:17.452 --> 58:19.537
- Let's just take a breath.
- I'm breathing fine.

58:19.621 --> 58:21.205
Zoneseal 2000.

58:21.290 --> 58:25.168
Your company was hired
to provide Zoneseal 2000 and SCR-100,

58:25.252 --> 58:28.671
a synthetic, cement-like substance
meant to seal off the well, yes or no?

58:28.755 --> 58:31.507
- Yes, we were, but now you're saying...
- That's all I was saying.

58:31.592 --> 58:34.177
Now I'm asking if your company did tests
on the substance

58:34.261 --> 58:36.512
before installing it at the base
of Deepwater Horizon.

58:36.597 --> 58:38.973
We do exhaustive tests
on everything we manufacture.

58:39.057 --> 58:42.685
Do you have the results of these exhaustive
tests done on Zoneseal 2000?

58:42.769 --> 58:44.395
Now you're being unnecessarily flippant.

58:44.479 --> 58:47.023
Look, I am not some college student
you can shout at.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.025
We're not going to commercial
till he answers your question.

58:49.109 --> 58:51.360
No, you're the spokesperson for Halliburton.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.112
And I came on this program voluntarily.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.363
I don't have subpoena power.

58:54.448 --> 58:55.907
Everyone comes on this program voluntarily.

58:55.991 --> 58:58.701
Understand that this is all happening fast

58:58.785 --> 59:01.704
and that this is information
that isn't at our fingertips.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.039
You don't have the test results
at your fingertips?

59:03.123 --> 59:04.540
For the moment,
Halliburton's thoughts and prayers...

59:04.625 --> 59:06.375
All of our thoughts and prayers
are with the missing crew...

59:06.460 --> 59:08.294
Nobody's thoughts and prayers
are with the fire.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.712
- Sir...
- Good to see you again, Will.

59:09.796 --> 59:13.591
Aren't the test results on a computer?
Are they buried in the middle of a wheat field?

59:13.675 --> 59:15.384
- We will make the test results...
- It's about time.

59:15.469 --> 59:16.886
What's the Minerals Management Agency?

59:16.970 --> 59:19.430
It's the Minerals Management Service,
the MMS,

59:19.514 --> 59:23.059
and they have 56 inspectors
overseeing 3,500 production facilities

59:23.143 --> 59:26.646
that operate 35,591 wells in the Gulf region.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.981
That's according to the Interior Department,
not Wikipedia.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.400
56 inspectors for 35,000 wells?

59:31.485 --> 59:34.195
- It gets better.
- We're out. Back in 90 seconds.

59:34.279 --> 59:36.280
- BP statement?
- Hang on.

59:36.365 --> 59:38.449
Inspections for drilling rigs
are required monthly,

59:38.533 --> 59:43.162
but Deepwater Horizon was only inspected
nine times in 2009 and six times in 2008.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.914
- What's coming?
- Hang on.

59:44.998 --> 59:48.501
The last inspection was done 20 days ago
by Eric Neal,

59:48.585 --> 59:51.254
who was sent by himself even though
he had only just started his training

59:51.338 --> 59:52.797
as a government inspector of drilling rigs.

59:52.881 --> 59:54.173
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.591
- Is it the BP statement?
- Oh, my God,

59:55.676 --> 59:57.635
would somebody hit him with a stun gun?

59:57.719 --> 59:58.719
30 seconds.

59:58.804 --> 1:00:00.846
What I wouldn't give
to have a phone hook-up with this guy.

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:02.181
- You do.
- What?

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:03.933
He's on hold. It's this blinking light.

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:07.812
Maggie, I am taking you shopping!

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:09.522
- Will, listen up.
- Phone graphic, Eric Neal.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:11.274
- N-E-A-L.
- Minerals Management is wildly understaffed.

1:00:11.358 --> 1:00:12.608
- Jesus.
- We've got the guy on the phone.

1:00:12.693 --> 1:00:14.026
Give me all the numbers.

1:00:15.028 --> 1:00:16.529
- Me?
- Give him the numbers.

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:19.115
- Let's go!
- Okay. 56 inspectors.

1:00:19.199 --> 1:00:21.534
- 10 seconds.
- 3,500...

1:00:23.996 --> 1:00:25.997
Take it easy with him.
He's gonna be scared to death.

1:00:26.081 --> 1:00:28.124
In three, two...

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:32.378
Welcome back to breaking news.

1:00:32.462 --> 1:00:36.215
The oil rig BP Deepwater Horizon
has exploded into flames

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:38.259
50 miles off the coast of Louisiana,

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:41.345
leaving 11 crew members missing
and feared dead.

1:00:41.430 --> 1:00:44.307
We're on the phone with Eric Neal
of the Minerals Management Service.

1:00:44.391 --> 1:00:45.933
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Neal.

1:00:46.018 --> 1:00:47.518
It's good to... Thank you.

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:51.647
Can you confirm that the MMS employs
56 inspectors in the Gulf region?

1:00:51.732 --> 1:00:52.815
I believe that's correct.

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:57.611
And the 56 of you oversee 35,591 wells?

1:00:57.904 --> 1:01:01.824
- I believe that's correct.
- That's 635 wells for each inspector.

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:04.160
The wells are required
to be inspected once a month.

1:01:04.244 --> 1:01:06.162
- Is that correct?
- The drilling wells, yes.

1:01:06.538 --> 1:01:08.873
Is it possible with so few inspectors
and so many wells

1:01:08.957 --> 1:01:11.917
to properly inspect each platform
as scheduled?

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:15.463
Ourbudget's very limited.

1:01:15.547 --> 1:01:18.299
A single inspector would
have to thoroughly review two wells a day,

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:19.967
six days a week for a year.

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:21.969
I know.

1:01:22.054 --> 1:01:24.805
Would an easy solution be
to have the oil companies themselves

1:01:24.890 --> 1:01:26.974
pay for the cost of a proper inspection?

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:30.269
Isn't that what car owners have to do?

1:01:30.354 --> 1:01:33.689
Well, that isn't my field of expertise.

1:01:33.774 --> 1:01:35.691
- Statement from BP.
- Right here.

1:01:35.776 --> 1:01:39.695
Mr. Neal, you were sent to inspect
Deepwater Horizon 19 days ago,

1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:41.781
April 1 st, is that right?

1:01:41.948 --> 1:01:43.532
I was, yes.

1:01:43.617 --> 1:01:46.410
Were you aware that dating
back to September, 2001,

1:01:46.495 --> 1:01:50.873
Deepwater Horizon had shown five red flags
or incidents of noncompliance?

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:54.085
Um, I'm not sure
I'm authorized to speak about that.

1:01:54.169 --> 1:01:56.879
I understand. I only have two more questions.

1:01:56.963 --> 1:01:59.215
Prior to your inspection
of the rig on April 1st,

1:01:59.299 --> 1:02:02.968
how many inspections
had you done of offshore oil drilling rigs?

1:02:04.638 --> 1:02:06.472
- None.
- None?

1:02:06.556 --> 1:02:09.558
- Except in training.
- And how long have you been in training?

1:02:10.519 --> 1:02:12.937
- Four months.
- Thank you very much.

1:02:13.021 --> 1:02:15.689
That was Eric Neal
with the Minerals Management Service.

1:02:15.774 --> 1:02:18.692
- We have the statement.
- We now have a statement from BP.

1:02:18.777 --> 1:02:20.486
We'll put it up on the screen for you.

1:02:20.779 --> 1:02:22.863
"The thoughts and prayers..."

1:02:22.948 --> 1:02:24.615
"The thoughts and prayers of Tony Hayward

1:02:24.699 --> 1:02:26.867
"and everyone at BP
are with the missing crew members

1:02:26.952 --> 1:02:29.578
"of the BP Deepwater Horizon
and their families.

1:02:29.663 --> 1:02:32.915
"We are looking at every possible solution
to the problem of capping the well

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:35.418
"and will, of course,
offer our complete assistance

1:02:35.502 --> 1:02:37.795
"to the various US agencies
involved in repairing

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:40.840
"and cleaning up the damage done
by this terrible accident."

1:02:42.134 --> 1:02:44.093
So, glass half-full.

1:02:44.970 --> 1:02:47.096
They're offering to help clean up.

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:51.183
This is obviously just beginning.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.436
We'll be bringing you more
as this story develops.

1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:56.772
Terry Smith is coming up right now
with The Capitol Report from Washington.

1:02:56.857 --> 1:02:58.858
I'm Will McAvoy. Goodnight.

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:38.731
Did the White House call?

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:41.567
Gibbs wants to know what we know
and how we know it.

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:43.402
We're not giving up the new guy.

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:46.530
Hey, the news alert's at red.

1:03:46.615 --> 1:03:48.782
- We got it right.
- We got the spill right.

1:03:48.867 --> 1:03:50.367
We don't know
what we're doing with Halliburton.

1:03:50.452 --> 1:03:52.411
- We don't know what's gonna happen...
- God, you're a pussy.

1:03:52.496 --> 1:03:56.248
- You know, I'm just being...
- And it's not like you said the sorority girl

1:03:56.333 --> 1:03:59.001
is responsible for setting
the hemisphere on fire.

1:03:59.085 --> 1:04:02.254
Give the Internet an hour.
That's exactly what it'll say we said.

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:05.216
I'm too old to be governed
by fear of dumb people.

1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:06.592
I'm not.

1:04:07.594 --> 1:04:09.303
You're older than you think.

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:12.264
Don't learn that the hard way.

1:04:14.226 --> 1:04:18.270
You didn't bring her in to right the ship.
You brought her in to build a new one.

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:19.855
You knew Don would go with Elliot.

1:04:19.940 --> 1:04:22.775
- You orchestrated the whole thing.
- Yeah.

1:04:23.902 --> 1:04:27.821
For a long time now, I badly wanted to watch
the news on my TV at night.

1:04:28.114 --> 1:04:32.034
Then it occurred to me, I run a news division.

1:04:32.953 --> 1:04:35.788
She's indifferent to ratings, competition,
corporate concerns,

1:04:35.872 --> 1:04:37.957
and, generally speaking, consequences.

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:40.459
Good, 'cause you just described my job.

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:42.878
I'm Don Quixote, you can be Sancho,

1:04:42.963 --> 1:04:45.714
she'll be Dulcinea,
and everyone out there is the horse.

1:04:45.799 --> 1:04:48.467
Donkey. How did you know
about that conversation?

1:04:48.552 --> 1:04:50.344
I know everything.

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:53.305
Anchors having an opinion
isn't a new phenomenon.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:56.892
Murrow had one and that
was the end of McCarthy.

1:04:56.977 --> 1:04:59.144
Cronkite had one and that
was the end of Vietnam.

1:04:59.229 --> 1:05:02.690
- I'm not those guys.
- I'm betting all my money on you're wrong.

1:05:03.316 --> 1:05:04.733
You know what, kiddo?

1:05:04.818 --> 1:05:09.196
In the old days of about 10 minutes ago,
we did the news well.

1:05:09.281 --> 1:05:13.075
You know how? We just decided to.

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:23.127
Will...

1:05:23.837 --> 1:05:27.798
I fucking loved
what you said at Northwestern,

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:30.092
and that's why I brought her here.

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:45.232
Neal.

1:05:46.484 --> 1:05:48.694
- Welcome to the show, mate.
- Thanks for everything.

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:50.446
Take care.

1:05:50.530 --> 1:05:52.114
- Hey, good show.
- Good show.

1:05:52.198 --> 1:05:53.490
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

1:05:54.034 --> 1:05:56.076
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:07.087
- Excuse me. Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1:06:07.172 --> 1:06:11.008
I didn't have time before to say great job.

1:06:11.092 --> 1:06:12.968
Are you kidding? You were like Batman.

1:06:13.053 --> 1:06:14.261
I am, actually.

1:06:14.346 --> 1:06:17.723
I felt like the cape was a little campy,
but I still have the car and the utility belt.

1:06:18.725 --> 1:06:20.643
- Right.
- Yeah.

1:06:21.519 --> 1:06:23.729
I shouldn't say things.

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:26.148
Well, that was huge.

1:06:26.232 --> 1:06:28.233
- I just answered my phone.
- Well...

1:06:28.318 --> 1:06:30.819
Don, we got off on the wrong foot.

1:06:30.904 --> 1:06:33.322
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I appreciate that.

1:06:33.406 --> 1:06:35.741
Another night when I haven't
spent the day getting my ass kicked, okay?

1:06:35.825 --> 1:06:37.242
You got it.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.495
- Are your folks down in the lobby?
- Yeah.

1:06:40.246 --> 1:06:43.666
How about I come down and say hi?
We get to meet. I'll apologize in person.

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:46.960
I'll come back upstairs for a couple of minutes
so it looks like I'm working.

1:06:47.045 --> 1:06:48.837
You call me when you're done with dinner.

1:06:49.839 --> 1:06:51.465
It's a compromise.

1:06:52.384 --> 1:06:53.676
You!

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:02.518
Your name is Margaret Jordan.

1:07:04.854 --> 1:07:06.355
Yes, it is.

1:07:07.649 --> 1:07:09.525
That was a good show, Will.

1:07:11.778 --> 1:07:13.862
MacKenzie, I was wrong, you were right.

1:07:14.948 --> 1:07:16.740
What did everybody else run?

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:20.285
What did they run, Don?

1:07:20.370 --> 1:07:23.664
Flights resumed in Europe and
the iPhone prototype that was left at a bar.

1:07:24.916 --> 1:07:26.583
They all closed with the oil rig, though.

1:07:26.668 --> 1:07:27.918
Spill?

1:07:28.128 --> 1:07:29.294
Search and rescue.

1:07:36.636 --> 1:07:37.886
We should go.

1:07:39.973 --> 1:07:41.390
Goodnight, guys.

1:07:42.934 --> 1:07:44.685
Night.

1:07:57.991 --> 1:07:59.658
I don't know what you're miming.

1:07:59.743 --> 1:08:01.034
Just...

1:08:03.204 --> 1:08:04.538
You're fine.

1:08:26.561 --> 1:08:28.771
Can I talk to you a second?

1:08:28.855 --> 1:08:30.856
8:00 to 9:00 is over.

1:08:34.694 --> 1:08:36.737
I understand.
I just wanted to mention something.

1:08:36.821 --> 1:08:39.907
Hang on.
Enough of this shit about being disengaged.

1:08:42.827 --> 1:08:44.787
Guys, great job tonight.

1:08:44.871 --> 1:08:47.664
These things are done by teams,
and I've got the best team in television.

1:08:47.749 --> 1:08:49.249
I'm gonna make sure
each and every one of you

1:08:49.334 --> 1:08:51.251
knows how important you are to me.

1:08:53.546 --> 1:08:55.547
- This isn't our control room.
- No.

1:08:55.632 --> 1:08:57.090
Then screw it.

1:09:00.595 --> 1:09:02.012
Will.

1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:07.684
You won't remember this,

1:09:07.769 --> 1:09:11.230
but the first time you met my parents,
you had flowers for my mother.

1:09:11.731 --> 1:09:15.526
You took my father to an Orioles game,
and then you met us for dinner.

1:09:15.610 --> 1:09:17.277
And I wanted to tell you...

1:09:20.865 --> 1:09:22.866
That you were perfect.

1:09:24.744 --> 1:09:26.995
Like I said, you wouldn't remember,
but I wanted to thank you...

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.666
The Orioles won 4-3
on a walk-off double from Miguel Tejada

1:09:30.750 --> 1:09:32.167
with runners on first and third.

1:09:32.252 --> 1:09:35.170
Your father ordered a beer,
and I ordered a Diet Coke.

1:09:35.255 --> 1:09:37.840
And he said, "McAvoy,
you're a Republican nitwit

1:09:37.924 --> 1:09:39.716
"and every word you've ever said or
written about China

1:09:39.801 --> 1:09:42.261
"is incomprehensible bollocks.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:47.182
"But for reasons passing understanding,
my MacKenzie seems to be in love with you.

1:09:47.267 --> 1:09:51.728
"So you can have a pint on a hot summer's
day without earning my disapproval."

1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:53.981
We ended up having three.

1:09:59.863 --> 1:10:02.573
You two idiots were drunk
when you met us for dinner?

1:10:02.699 --> 1:10:04.616
Yeah.

1:10:06.578 --> 1:10:08.203
Your dad's feeling all right?

1:10:10.582 --> 1:10:13.041
Charlie says you're physically
and mentally exhausted.

1:10:14.794 --> 1:10:18.130
I've been exhausted since I was 30.
Everybody's exhausted.

1:10:21.801 --> 1:10:23.719
I just wanted to come back
and be in a newsroom.

1:10:25.638 --> 1:10:27.973
Well, this one's yours for a week.

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:31.226
- Good show tonight.
- You, too.

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:37.149
It wasn't vertigo medicine.

1:10:38.568 --> 1:10:41.153
I thought I saw you in the audience.
That's how I got flustered.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:44.197
I thought I saw you,
but it turned out to be someone else.

1:10:46.326 --> 1:10:47.826
No, wait.
