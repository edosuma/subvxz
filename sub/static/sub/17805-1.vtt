01:07.663 --> 01:12.919
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

01:18.855 --> 01:24.116
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!

01:28.504 --> 01:33.996
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

02:10.908 --> 02:12.623
What is it like,
the planet we're approaching?

02:12.648 --> 02:16.666
Nothing but ice and snow.
A barren desert of whiteness.

02:17.111 --> 02:18.774
Scan it with our computer waves.

02:18.974 --> 02:21.737
The enemy's weapons may be
hidden beneath its surface.

05:09.048 --> 05:10.940
Aha!
Looks like the cops.

05:14.427 --> 05:16.715
As Thor, chief of the imperial police,

05:16.915 --> 05:19.203
I order you to surrender at once

05:23.438 --> 05:25.148
Stella, you cheap smuggler

05:25.173 --> 05:26.991
I am police robot M.

05:27.191 --> 05:29.003
You have the right to remain silent.

05:32.571 --> 05:34.877
Go for hyper space.

05:47.256 --> 05:49.536
Let's hope this star-buggy stays together.

05:50.563 --> 05:53.073
What's our chances?
40% total disintegration..

05:53.373 --> 05:55.164
30% molecular ignition..

05:55.364 --> 05:57.264
..20% gamma contamination.

05:57.521 --> 05:59.319
You are very reassuring
I assume that means -

05:59.472 --> 06:01.504
we have a 10% chance
of making it.

06:01.781 --> 06:04.078
Not really!
3% structural collapse

06:04.378 --> 06:06.160
3%...
Alright Alright!

06:06.368 --> 06:08.004
Just keep on course
and get ready

06:08.104 --> 06:10.004
to reenter normal space.

06:15.023 --> 06:17.023
Ready when you are.

06:21.821 --> 06:23.276
We've done it!
We've done it!

06:23.370 --> 06:25.376
Not quite. Look!
The Nutrant star!

06:27.452 --> 06:29.966
If it gets a hold on us,
it'll crush us.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.302
Prepare to release
Ath-Power stage.

06:42.775 --> 06:43.823
Eject!
Eject!

06:54.045 --> 06:55.927
Ha Ha!
We made it.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.515
Plot us a new course,
so that cop cant find us.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.026
Even as you speak.
It's been taken care of.

07:04.919 --> 07:07.355
There's the border
of the haunted stars.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.439
If we'd traveled
one second further,

07:09.464 --> 07:11.777
we would have wound up
right beside them.

07:12.746 --> 07:14.635
What in the universe is that?

07:21.958 --> 07:23.878
It's a spaceship.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.067
No, its a launch.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.693
Their power is totally down.

07:29.242 --> 07:30.999
Maybe they're wounded,

07:31.199 --> 07:33.099
to weak to send a signal.

07:33.299 --> 07:35.299
I'm gonna have a look.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.541
What's the radiation level?

07:55.928 --> 07:58.002
Normal.
The hull isn't damaged.

07:58.204 --> 07:59.907
I'm going inside.

08:15.336 --> 08:16.735
Is everything alright?

08:17.307 --> 08:18.403
Yes!

08:18.603 --> 08:21.103
Wait a minute..
There's someone here.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.003
He looks like he's hurt pretty bad,

08:40.097 --> 08:41.433
but he's alive

08:42.761 --> 08:44.275
I'll try to get him back to the ship.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.375
I'll help you bring him aboard.

08:51.514 --> 08:53.127
He's dehydrated.

08:53.153 --> 08:54.753
Suffering from exhaustion.

08:54.870 --> 08:57.833
But the launch was full of supplies.
Everything he could have needed.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.193
He's also in chock.

09:02.299 --> 09:04.775
He keeps talking about monsters..
..Red monsters

09:07.415 --> 09:09.990
He wants us to alert someone..
Urgently.

09:10.015 --> 09:11.098
Who?

09:12.478 --> 09:15.078
The Emperor
of the first circle of the universe.

09:20.759 --> 09:23.081
It's the emblem of the chief
officers of the imperial navy.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.778
I'd say red hot potatoes for
small time smugglers on the run like us.

09:29.985 --> 09:31.752
We'll, what do we do?

09:31.789 --> 09:33.626
You go to prison, Stella star.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.500
Your leap through
hyperspace didn’t fool us.

09:36.838 --> 09:39.219
Your friction trail was easy to follow.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.016
Hehehe..

09:41.869 --> 09:44.237
You are completely
surrounded by fighter ships.

09:50.370 --> 09:52.213
This time you've won.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.279
We surrender.

09:54.402 --> 09:56.620
There won't be a next time, Stella Star!

09:56.853 --> 09:59.153
Don't worry.
We'll get out of this.

10:41.571 --> 10:42.613
My Lord!

10:45.276 --> 10:48.269
Yes. What is it Ellrik?

10:48.583 --> 10:50.797
They found one damned survivor.

10:50.997 --> 10:54.810
Right now, the imperial shuttle ship
has taken him to their medical centre.

10:55.210 --> 10:58.042
But his brain seems to
be thoroughly damaged

10:59.238 --> 11:01.425
He will be of no help to them,
to find the ship.

11:02.123 --> 11:03.823
Mhmm..

11:15.997 --> 11:18.598
Come to me, Golem!

11:37.899 --> 11:41.124
I have a simple task for you.

11:42.095 --> 11:44.999
You must not fail me.

11:55.297 --> 12:00.240
Therefore, the great machines
of the central operating system..

12:00.390 --> 12:05.410
..of imperial justice hereby sentence you,

12:05.560 --> 12:08.380
Akton, of ninth Vega..

12:08.530 --> 12:13.002
..to 220 years hard labor

12:13.152 --> 12:16.070
in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.763
As for you, Stella Star,

12:21.913 --> 12:24.938
having considered all the arguments..

12:25.038 --> 12:28.338
Studied all the Video-tapes,
the accusations..

12:28.438 --> 12:33.063
..we condemn you to forced labor for life..

12:33.263 --> 12:36.960
..in the penal colony..

12:37.110 --> 12:38.510
..of Nocturne the 2nd

12:39.949 --> 12:42.599
This session is hereby adjourned.

12:46.184 --> 12:48.445
Throw the radium into the furnace.

12:48.469 --> 12:49.874
Careful now.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.164
I said let's go, move!

12:52.686 --> 12:54.308
Faster!

12:54.413 --> 12:56.158
Move, Let's go!

12:56.180 --> 12:57.932
Will you step it up!

12:58.450 --> 13:00.520
Here! You can move faster than that!

13:01.349 --> 13:03.046
Careful with that Radium.

13:03.512 --> 13:07.412
Will you move!
Move down those stairs!

13:07.512 --> 13:08.924
Throw it the furnace!

13:09.124 --> 13:11.024
Do what I tell you!

13:11.324 --> 13:14.824
Where do you think you are.
We haven't got all day!

13:16.199 --> 13:17.999
Alright, 5 minutes of rest

13:18.199 --> 13:19.727
Move quickly now!

13:19.927 --> 13:22.627
Prisoners get back to their posts!
Let's go!

13:22.827 --> 13:24.927
Come on quickly now!

13:28.326 --> 13:29.501
Let's go!

13:31.450 --> 13:33.977
I've been at this for 12 straight hours..

13:35.533 --> 13:37.202
..the radiation will burn my skin off.

13:37.351 --> 13:39.097
Were not slaves.

13:40.074 --> 13:41.203
You'd better work.

13:41.303 --> 13:44.024
If you don’t want the taste of the burning
of their energy whips too.

13:44.516 --> 13:46.634
But there must be a way to escape.

13:47.128 --> 13:49.227
There will be a way, you know.

13:49.751 --> 13:51.294
Blow ups happen.

13:51.547 --> 13:54.967
If I could only succeed
in overfeeding the furnace.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.279
But overfeed it with what?

13:57.453 --> 13:58.884
Energy!

13:58.984 --> 14:01.061
Then a gun ray could be enough.

14:01.161 --> 14:02.465
Planing an escape!

14:02.565 --> 14:04.089
This is what you're gonna get, lady!

16:24.248 --> 16:26.313
You can drop the riffle-ray.

16:32.309 --> 16:34.470
Now turn around.

16:37.511 --> 16:38.685
You!

16:40.216 --> 16:42.849
I bet you never expected to see me here.

16:43.444 --> 16:45.586
And you too.

16:45.646 --> 16:47.990
Poor Stella.
Your escape efforts have been wasted.

16:48.015 --> 16:49.449
OK.

16:49.918 --> 16:51.691
I've lost again.

16:51.891 --> 16:54.444
We were sent to free you,
your sentence has been cancelled.

16:55.131 --> 16:56.531
Have you both gone mad?

16:56.631 --> 16:59.547
I only have logic animotion circuits.
No room for craziness.

16:59.847 --> 17:02.243
Well, I've been assigned
to a top secret imperial mission,

17:02.252 --> 17:04.452
we must now leave and set Akton free.

17:09.051 --> 17:11.034
There, he's yours

17:15.223 --> 17:16.840
My gift to you.

17:20.010 --> 17:22.068
Would I lie to you?

17:36.312 --> 17:39.012
Look, it is the imperial flagship.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.665
Akton, you are gonna meet
some real royalty.

18:54.865 --> 18:58.527
He's here!
There is his holographic image.

19:11.097 --> 19:14.672
His Highness; The emperor
of the first circle of the universe.

19:15.618 --> 19:20.354
I come to you because my faithful robot,
Elle, has told me..

19:21.238 --> 19:24.163
..that you are the only one
who could save us.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.860
You know, you must
be the best pilot in the whole galaxy..

19:29.477 --> 19:32.738
..and you Akton, the best navigator.

19:32.938 --> 19:37.101
Stella, our galaxy is split..

19:37.407 --> 19:39.554
..into 2 waring factions.

19:39.906 --> 19:45.105
Our own and
the one ruled by the evil count..

19:45.455 --> 19:49.287
..Zarth Arn!
From the league of the dark worlds.

19:49.979 --> 19:54.880
Recently we've begun to receive troublesome
reports from our spies among the league.

19:55.305 --> 19:59.776
They have informed us
that the count has created a weapon..

20:00.079 --> 20:03.706
..a new, limitless weapon.

20:04.015 --> 20:06.626
A Weapon so vast, so huge..

20:07.065 --> 20:11.246
..that it would take
a whole planet to conceal it.

20:12.987 --> 20:15.408
That is why we sent the mission ship.

20:15.740 --> 20:17.685
Did they find the planet?

20:18.117 --> 20:20.519
The ship came so close..

20:20.936 --> 20:22.629
..so close..

20:23.789 --> 20:26.172
..to discovering the counts secret..

20:28.544 --> 20:31.764
.. when it was suddenly attacked
by a horde of unknown monsters.

20:33.001 --> 20:35.229
We had assumed it was destroyed,

20:35.254 --> 20:37.240
we lost all hope.

20:37.613 --> 20:43.136
Until you found the launch from that ship.

20:43.236 --> 20:46.046
And now, with the utmost secrecy..

20:47.727 --> 20:51.954
..you must sail to the haunted stars.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.841
You must find that ship.

20:55.866 --> 20:58.827
Find the counts secret

20:58.977 --> 21:01.191
planet and destroy it.

21:07.109 --> 21:08.330
There's something else.

21:11.483 --> 21:13.079
When you complete the mission..

21:14.322 --> 21:16.370
.. search for the commander..

21:16.908 --> 21:18.224
..of that missing ship.

21:23.389 --> 21:25.364
He was my only son.

21:53.630 --> 21:56.385
The first possibility is the Origa system.

21:56.727 --> 21:58.533
Also know as the worlds asleep.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.102
But this system is still within our galaxy

22:01.450 --> 22:03.642
and we should've found it by now.

22:04.259 --> 22:06.376
The same also applies
to the white sun of Ohzon

22:08.045 --> 22:10.082
so only the third possibility remains:

22:10.845 --> 22:12.909
The heart of the haunted stars.

22:14.452 --> 22:16.357
An unknown planet named..

22:16.924 --> 22:18.141
Euraphas!

22:19.243 --> 22:21.121
Well, shall we begin our search?

22:22.268 --> 22:23.723
Lets go!

22:23.905 --> 22:25.885
The distance we must travel is enormous.

22:25.965 --> 22:29.149
By using hyperspace,
what would normally take 2 months to reach

22:29.251 --> 22:31.262
We should do in 2 hours.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.474
Everything ready?
Ready! Right!

22:36.926 --> 22:40.083
Every time I go into hyperspace
I get nervous.

22:51.588 --> 22:53.783
Prepare for re-entry to normal space.

23:01.524 --> 23:03.481
We've arrived!

23:18.345 --> 23:21.263
Its not very far from here.
You can reach by using the space shuttle.

23:24.395 --> 23:27.278
Thor and I will wait for you there.
Hidden in that canyon.

23:27.547 --> 23:30.219
So that were ready in case of another
surprise attack of the count.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.285
That sounds fine with me.

23:33.508 --> 23:34.963
Is there air out there?

23:35.022 --> 23:36.768
Yeah. Yeah you can breathe.

23:37.302 --> 23:39.981
Alright. lets go!
Follow me!

23:45.161 --> 23:48.457
I'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship.
The controls are easy!

23:48.548 --> 23:50.638
Now watch your step right here.

24:00.099 --> 24:01.732
Take care.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.536
You alright?
You bet. Lets go.

24:19.964 --> 24:25.333
Don't you think were a little low?
I haven't been programmed to walk on water.

24:26.166 --> 24:29.182
Ohh me. water makes me so nervous

24:29.380 --> 24:31.344
Everything makes you nervous.

24:32.349 --> 24:35.197
It's the launch.
Lets land.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.006
OK! Take it in easy.

24:39.018 --> 24:41.835
Shuttle to star-ship!
We are landing now.

24:42.399 --> 24:43.411
Roger. Out.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.430
My seat-belt’s stuck.

24:52.597 --> 24:53.631
Oh Elle, come on!

24:54.125 --> 24:55.732
Take it easy, I'm coming.

25:00.706 --> 25:01.706
Look at that!

25:01.976 --> 25:03.030
Amazing!

25:03.420 --> 25:05.662
It's almost buried.

25:05.687 --> 25:07.829
The impact was tremendous.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.222
I doubt if anyone could have survived.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.572
The nuclear exhaust ports
have been gutted by fire.

25:21.135 --> 25:22.841
We'd better look around.

25:23.436 --> 25:24.746
What's that?

25:25.976 --> 25:27.424
I don't know.

25:40.443 --> 25:42.446
Seems to be a planetary artifact.

25:42.704 --> 25:44.779
Well, it certainly is an antique.

25:44.908 --> 25:46.892
Looks like some sort of Laser spear.

25:47.884 --> 25:49.808
This planet is inhabited.

25:49.947 --> 25:51.773
We must be very careful.

25:51.892 --> 25:53.995
We are in the evil counts domain.

25:56.399 --> 25:59.908
These stars are extremely far
and remote, even for him.

26:00.526 --> 26:04.117
Probably they've set up
a fully independent kind of civilization.

26:05.371 --> 26:09.419
We're wasting time. We'd better
start looking for the missing crew.

26:10.129 --> 26:11.697
Come on. Lets go this way.

26:12.879 --> 26:16.190
Look!
Amazons on horseback.

26:16.515 --> 26:18.241
I hope they are friendly.

26:20.563 --> 26:22.487
We'll soon find out.

26:35.455 --> 26:36.983
Take my revenge.

26:39.978 --> 26:41.188
Kill 'em.

26:55.260 --> 26:56.590
Die robot.

26:59.507 --> 27:01.134
You'll pay for this -
All of you!

27:03.990 --> 27:05.121
Don't make us kill you.

27:07.324 --> 27:08.454
Come on!

27:13.038 --> 27:15.181
Stop!
There is no escape.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.770
Take your hands off of me.

27:20.988 --> 27:22.119
Let me go.

27:29.242 --> 27:31.881
Get your hands off of me.
Let me go.

27:37.009 --> 27:39.310
Queen Querrelia. This
is the spy we captured.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.136
She came through the forbidden sea.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.576
You're a spy.

27:43.874 --> 27:45.799
As the men from the launch were too.

27:47.783 --> 27:50.362
But nothing
is going to stop the count anymore.

27:51.953 --> 27:54.492
Even if you had passed by this world..

27:54.611 --> 27:56.858
..you'd never
be able to discover the counts planet.

28:00.028 --> 28:04.988
Two packs of murdering guardians are there
to watch and protect it from intruders.

28:06.099 --> 28:09.711
..and now:
Put her into the mind probe.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.305
No! No!

28:11.385 --> 28:12.992
Hold it right there!

28:13.210 --> 28:14.242
Elle!

28:15.214 --> 28:17.912
Release her or I'll blast your queen.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.063
I mean it.

28:21.960 --> 28:22.992
Come on now.

28:23.170 --> 28:25.015
Don’t you people move or you are dead.

28:26.474 --> 28:29.410
Give me the trouble and I'm
gonna clean out your sinuses real good lady

28:29.709 --> 28:31.078
Now you stand there.

28:31.891 --> 28:32.903
Ok, Close the door.

28:33.181 --> 28:34.868
Don’t you follow us now.

28:35.066 --> 28:37.031
Stop them!
Stop them!

28:42.864 --> 28:43.936
Behind you!

28:45.820 --> 28:47.407
Come on, lets go!

28:47.546 --> 28:49.947
Elle you're terrific.
I didn't know you had it in you.

28:55.799 --> 28:57.737
Where's the release mechanism?

28:57.883 --> 28:59.149
It's jammed!

28:59.867 --> 29:01.296
Take cover!

29:03.240 --> 29:05.046
Here goes the last shot.

29:06.692 --> 29:07.882
Full power!

29:10.932 --> 29:11.963
Come on, lets go!

29:12.597 --> 29:13.728
Hurry! Hurry!!

29:19.066 --> 29:20.118
Guardian..

29:20.892 --> 29:22.656
..take my revenge.

29:24.145 --> 29:25.534
Kill them.

29:35.628 --> 29:36.628
Look!

29:37.533 --> 29:39.562
Whoa!
Run for your life!

29:40.826 --> 29:43.564
There! That narrow
passage in the rocks.

29:44.655 --> 29:46.362
Come on Stella, run!

30:12.087 --> 30:13.159
Hurry!

30:31.906 --> 30:33.176
Oh! Elle!

30:50.326 --> 30:52.053
We better move!

30:52.093 --> 30:54.256
The amazon air-fighters will be here soon.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.914
Quick, to the ship!

31:16.943 --> 31:19.879
They're attacking.
I'll man the laser-canon.

31:22.618 --> 31:24.046
Specter 7..Fire!

31:33.703 --> 31:35.866
Ok, get ready.
Here they come.

31:37.750 --> 31:39.972
Power is up to full battle speed.

31:48.249 --> 31:49.257
You!

31:50.215 --> 31:52.255
Why don't you come back now?

31:53.706 --> 31:55.363
Here they come. Specter 3.

32:04.379 --> 32:06.445
Alright.
We've got them!

32:08.595 --> 32:09.734
Fire! Fire!

32:10.695 --> 32:11.695
Yeah!

32:11.885 --> 32:13.853
One more.
There's one more!

32:19.093 --> 32:20.569
We've got 'em.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.706
Watch out on the right.

32:24.562 --> 32:26.364
We're down from 6 to 5.

32:26.713 --> 32:27.713
Get ready.

32:34.629 --> 32:36.003
More to the left.

32:39.718 --> 32:40.803
Steady.

32:40.941 --> 32:42.497
Then fire 5.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.114
Then 6.

32:44.348 --> 32:46.678
Fire the laser-canon, robot.
Fire!

32:47.685 --> 32:49.598
Yeah! Hahaa!

32:49.961 --> 32:51.175
We got it!

32:54.677 --> 32:56.431
We're holding.

32:59.651 --> 33:00.651
Now!

33:00.675 --> 33:02.940
8 ships approaching from the right. Fire!

33:06.854 --> 33:09.767
Alright, we've won.
We did it.

33:21.674 --> 33:24.907
I found the positions
to both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship.

33:26.053 --> 33:28.818
The mother-ship is closest
so we'll check it out first.

33:30.515 --> 33:31.515
It's here.

33:31.539 --> 33:33.864
On the 3rd planet
of the next solar system.

33:34.094 --> 33:35.889
I've never been there.

33:37.956 --> 33:38.956
What's it like?

33:39.004 --> 33:42.092
Red fogs, high winds, low gravity.

33:43.342 --> 33:44.660
The air is breathable.

33:44.842 --> 33:46.707
And the atmospheric conditions are stable.

33:47.310 --> 33:48.310
However..

33:48.472 --> 33:52.076
The entire planet
is covered with ice and snow.

33:53.304 --> 33:55.923
And you must
be extremely careful when the sun sets.

33:56.185 --> 33:58.289
The temperature drops
thousands of degrees.

33:58.571 --> 34:00.729
And in an instant, everything freezes over.

34:36.402 --> 34:38.456
What a terrible crash.

34:39.123 --> 34:40.909
No-one could have survived.

34:44.536 --> 34:47.353
Do you see any signs of the emperors son?

34:47.396 --> 34:49.697
If he's in the middle of all this

34:49.737 --> 34:53.032
I don't even know
if his own mother would recognize him.

34:55.418 --> 34:56.846
Then it's all over.

34:57.219 --> 35:00.449
There's no hope of ever
finding the counts secret fortress.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.944
There's still the third launch.

35:05.383 --> 35:07.898
It's probably
lost out in the stars, who knows?

35:08.758 --> 35:11.750
Anyway, it's useless
to raise false hopes.

35:12.572 --> 35:13.905
It's been too long.

35:13.930 --> 35:16.349
And this galaxy is wild and hostile.

35:16.778 --> 35:19.166
Come on Elle, lets go back to the ship.

35:20.172 --> 35:21.664
We'd better hurry.

35:21.697 --> 35:25.315
We're running out of time
and our power-packs are nearly finished.

35:25.354 --> 35:26.831
Let's get rid of them.

35:27.887 --> 35:29.363
It's gonna be a long walk back.

35:31.222 --> 35:32.754
My feet are already cold.

35:34.769 --> 35:37.920
It's times like these
i'm glad to be a robot.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.323
What's the matter with you, Akton?

36:07.583 --> 36:09.480
Well, I'm just refining my powers.

36:11.012 --> 36:13.623
And what's your problem,
ships-computer, huh!

36:15.817 --> 36:20.261
Is everything alright with Stella and Elle?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.452
I'm not worried about them.

36:23.551 --> 36:24.654
I'm just waiting.

36:28.879 --> 36:30.712
Your waiting is over.

36:38.316 --> 36:42.094
At last Thor.
You have some good news for me?

36:42.142 --> 36:45.301
Yes Excellency.
I have killed the alien pathfinder..

36:45.364 --> 36:47.029
..and taken over this ship.

36:47.077 --> 36:49.592
What of Stella Star?

36:50.338 --> 36:52.758
And that tin policeman.

36:52.933 --> 36:55.798
This planet
will take care of them, Excellency.

36:56.065 --> 36:57.430
Good!

36:57.992 --> 37:01.072
And I await your immediate arrival.

37:14.601 --> 37:16.688
Elle, how much further?

37:16.760 --> 37:19.910
We should be close.
Just a few more radiants.

37:25.175 --> 37:28.509
Ships-computer!
Why aren't the main engines firing?

37:30.406 --> 37:32.851
There is a malfunction.

37:33.707 --> 37:35.310
A malfunction?

37:36.007 --> 37:37.150
Where?

37:37.973 --> 37:41.576
I am not programmed for this malfunction.

38:12.441 --> 38:15.338
Akton!
We're here!

38:26.696 --> 38:29.521
Akton! Thor!
Let us in. The sun is setting.

38:29.577 --> 38:31.704
That's exactly why I'm not letting you in.

38:31.825 --> 38:35.039
Soon you'll be dead and
I'll be gone from this planet.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.439
Have you gone crazy? Open this hatch!

38:38.614 --> 38:39.614
No!

38:40.011 --> 38:41.169
Where's Akton?

38:41.262 --> 38:43.135
Akton is dead.

38:43.222 --> 38:45.547
And I'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn..

38:45.572 --> 38:47.628
..as the prince of the League of Darkness.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.926
Thor, a traitor?
I cannot believe it.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.846
I cannot trust
my own logic circuits anymore.

38:59.050 --> 39:00.391
He fooled me too.

39:01.153 --> 39:03.010
It's no use. We're gonna freeze.

39:03.238 --> 39:05.603
Maybe not.
Maybe I can save you.

39:05.643 --> 39:06.666
Let's stop here.

39:06.691 --> 39:09.143
Now you lie down in the snow, face up.

39:09.727 --> 39:10.735
Okay.

39:17.009 --> 39:20.016
Now give me your hand
so I can monitor your temperature.

39:23.747 --> 39:26.088
I can use my energy
to keep your heart working.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.421
You'll be in a state
of suspended animation.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.116
Elle!

39:30.847 --> 39:34.878
As an opponent, I always knew
you were programmed to never give up.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.006
Which was infuriating.

39:40.627 --> 39:42.246
But now that quality..

39:43.132 --> 39:44.386
..must be..

39:45.251 --> 39:46.441
..best.

39:46.513 --> 39:49.429
You are the most faithful companion
a woman ever had.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.810
And I too, respect you, Stella.

39:51.843 --> 39:54.104
You are the nicest human being I've known.

39:54.779 --> 39:58.255
Now, maybe, is a good time
to use your ancient system of prayer.

39:58.342 --> 40:00.532
And hope it works for robots, as well.

40:01.741 --> 40:03.487
Goodbye my friend.

40:05.066 --> 40:06.709
Goodbye for now, Stella.

40:29.118 --> 40:32.007
You were expected here hours ago!

40:32.476 --> 40:34.452
I've been delayed by a malfunction.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.793
I don't tolerate malfunctions..

40:37.841 --> 40:40.127
..or inefficiency here in my realm

40:42.561 --> 40:45.268
How long will the delay be?

40:46.315 --> 40:47.974
I think a very long time.

40:48.355 --> 40:50.728
You shouldn't try taking off
without asking me first.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.609
This time I'll make sure you are dead.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.502
I'll fix you.

41:43.797 --> 41:46.553
Alright Akton.
This is it.

41:47.180 --> 41:48.617
Say goodbye.

41:49.029 --> 41:50.029
What?

41:51.603 --> 41:52.785
Stop!

41:53.206 --> 41:54.754
Put down the gun.

41:54.779 --> 41:55.800
Stop!

41:55.825 --> 41:58.397
No-one can survive these deadly rays.

42:00.329 --> 42:03.305
Those deadly rays will be your death.

42:16.636 --> 42:17.643
Elle?

42:19.048 --> 42:20.199
Elle, do you read me?

42:20.224 --> 42:22.651
This is Akton.
I've taken over the ship.

42:22.676 --> 42:24.548
Do you read me?

42:39.333 --> 42:41.223
Her pulse rate is 16.

42:41.248 --> 42:44.675
She may survive if you can use your powers
and bring her back slowly.

42:45.547 --> 42:46.722
Careful now.

42:53.390 --> 42:54.620
Close the hatch.

43:45.285 --> 43:46.770
Look! It's working!

43:47.318 --> 43:48.652
She's going to make it.

44:11.467 --> 44:12.904
Come on Stella!

44:38.040 --> 44:39.175
Whats wrong?

44:39.200 --> 44:41.548
The main engines will not fire.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.484
Thor must have tried everything.

44:43.509 --> 44:45.231
What are we gonna do now?

44:45.952 --> 44:48.579
So..We get out of one mess..

44:48.612 --> 44:50.443
..just to find ourselves in another.

44:50.468 --> 44:51.499
Not necessarily.

44:51.579 --> 44:53.928
What do you mean?
We are stuck!

44:54.209 --> 44:56.328
Even the transmitter is out of order.

44:57.431 --> 44:58.987
We can take off immediately.

44:59.503 --> 45:00.709
Take off?
How?

45:01.943 --> 45:05.443
The ship is not operating,
simply because I borrowed this reactor.

45:14.534 --> 45:16.233
Then you knew about Thor.

45:16.763 --> 45:17.855
Yes I did.

45:19.783 --> 45:21.474
So you see into the future.

45:22.554 --> 45:24.601
All these years you never told me.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.696
Think of all the trouble
I might have avoided

45:27.721 --> 45:29.562
You have tried to change the future.

45:30.110 --> 45:31.745
Which is against the law.

45:32.142 --> 45:33.737
So therefore, I can tell you nothing.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.484
Let's find the 3rd launch.

45:35.674 --> 45:38.016
Akton, you are something else!

45:38.381 --> 45:40.341
Yes.
Time is running out.

45:40.831 --> 45:41.831
Lets go!

46:14.598 --> 46:15.878
We're arriving.

46:16.836 --> 46:18.725
That's the planet Demundia.

46:19.225 --> 46:21.855
There in barren land
and wast emptiness

46:21.880 --> 46:23.655
we'll find the 3rd launch.

46:27.123 --> 46:28.504
Somethings wrong.

46:28.529 --> 46:29.901
Everything has stopped.

46:29.926 --> 46:30.941
What's happening?

46:31.021 --> 46:32.124
Power failure!

46:40.339 --> 46:43.044
My circuits!
My circuits are failing.

46:43.069 --> 46:46.129
We've been hit.
By an energy beam.

46:51.828 --> 46:53.899
I am out of control.

46:54.685 --> 46:55.741
Look!

46:58.163 --> 46:59.401
What is it?

47:01.329 --> 47:03.290
It must be the Counts weapon!

47:03.338 --> 47:05.623
Oh my head, oh!

47:21.217 --> 47:23.804
Fire, you stupid robot!
Fire!

47:32.538 --> 47:34.292
What's happening?

47:52.912 --> 47:54.269
Here, let me help you.

47:55.971 --> 47:57.899
The attack is over.
You'll be alright.

47:57.931 --> 47:59.912
I thought I was gonna go insane.

48:00.103 --> 48:01.651
We've just survived an attack

48:01.676 --> 48:04.238
of the most powerful weapon
in the entire galaxy.

48:26.338 --> 48:28.701
If Akton's calculations
are correct

48:28.726 --> 48:30.799
we should find the launch this way.

48:32.454 --> 48:34.637
In a crater just over..

48:35.073 --> 48:36.105
There!

49:05.773 --> 49:07.138
Oh me!

49:07.607 --> 49:10.400
Don't say it. Don't say
I know..

49:10.463 --> 49:12.400
Steam makes you nervous.

49:12.701 --> 49:14.834
No, no! Not really.

49:15.438 --> 49:17.324
Why should I be nervous?

49:17.535 --> 49:20.366
There is nothing
to be afraid of round here.

49:32.766 --> 49:36.673
Looks totally wrecked
but it's definitely the third launch.

49:37.084 --> 49:37.951
I'd better go down.

49:37.976 --> 49:41.774
No, I insist.
Time for a little robot-chauvinism.

49:41.799 --> 49:43.243
You stay here.

49:44.027 --> 49:45.351
Be careful Elle.

49:45.795 --> 49:48.041
You do not have to worry about me!

50:33.044 --> 50:34.068
Release her!

51:37.848 --> 51:38.967
Let me down!

51:41.650 --> 51:42.443
Help!

51:43.173 --> 51:44.078
Help!

52:16.397 --> 52:17.286
Help!

52:17.350 --> 52:18.350
Don't.. Don't..

52:38.816 --> 52:39.840
Relax.

52:40.006 --> 52:41.467
Take it easy.
I'll cut you down.

52:46.473 --> 52:47.275
There.

52:47.703 --> 52:48.790
You're free.

52:57.608 --> 52:59.743
That was a little too close for comfort.

52:59.823 --> 53:00.641
Come on.

53:01.164 --> 53:01.958
Come on!

53:24.392 --> 53:25.527
We rest here.

53:25.947 --> 53:27.241
This is safe.

53:36.881 --> 53:37.897
Who are you?

53:48.055 --> 53:50.579
This is an energy-shield mask.

53:51.257 --> 53:53.099
And the amount of energy is limited.

53:56.091 --> 53:57.138
My name is Simon.

53:57.859 --> 54:00.844
I'm the only survivor
from the wreck of an imperial mission.

54:01.216 --> 54:02.264
Are you really?

54:02.650 --> 54:06.075
We've been searching for you
all through these damned haunted stars.

54:06.872 --> 54:07.792
Why?

54:08.591 --> 54:10.869
The emperor's orders
were to find the Count's phantom planet

54:10.894 --> 54:12.324
and to destroy it.

54:13.340 --> 54:15.022
So you know about the monsters?

54:15.967 --> 54:17.340
Yes I do.

54:17.716 --> 54:18.994
But it's useless.

54:20.502 --> 54:22.589
We did not succeed
in find the planet either.

54:24.339 --> 54:25.854
And now there's no time left.

54:26.267 --> 54:27.831
The cavemen will waiting for us.

54:43.739 --> 54:46.818
Alright, stay very close and very quiet.

54:50.385 --> 54:51.702
Oh, this way looks safe.

54:58.854 --> 54:59.943
This way.

55:25.366 --> 55:26.485
Simon!

55:48.776 --> 55:49.554
No!

55:59.715 --> 56:00.809
Akton!

56:28.642 --> 56:29.587
You alright?

56:30.417 --> 56:32.496
Akton, thank god you got here in time.

56:33.473 --> 56:34.877
You must've known all along.

56:37.086 --> 56:38.586
By the way, this is Simon.

56:39.015 --> 56:40.824
The only survivor
from the imperial mission.

56:40.907 --> 56:42.383
We owe you our lives.

56:43.089 --> 56:44.113
Now maybe..

56:44.374 --> 56:46.850
..with your help, we can still
find the Count's phantom planet

56:47.429 --> 56:49.754
Lets go aboard your ship
and continue on at once.

56:49.779 --> 56:51.596
There's no need to continue.

56:51.704 --> 56:53.093
Have you gone crazy?

56:53.775 --> 56:56.902
That's our primary mission: To
find the planet and destroy it.

56:56.927 --> 56:59.077
I know,
but we've already found it.

56:59.719 --> 57:00.719
Think about it.

57:00.981 --> 57:03.608
Then you'll understand that
this is the Count's planet.

57:05.138 --> 57:07.043
Remember what the Amazon queen said:

57:07.233 --> 57:10.575
A planet occupied
by two packs of evil defenders.

57:11.442 --> 57:13.212
The first we met while in space.

57:13.363 --> 57:14.339
The red monsters.

57:15.244 --> 57:16.284
And the second..

57:16.419 --> 57:17.641
Right here. The Troglodytes.

57:18.387 --> 57:21.355
And there’s no question about it.
This is the planet!

57:22.069 --> 57:22.942
This?

57:23.767 --> 57:24.990
That's incredible.

57:25.267 --> 57:27.132
I was here and I didn't even realise it.

57:27.783 --> 57:29.081
There's no way you could have.

57:29.467 --> 57:32.212
Anyway, we proceed at once
and destroy all that machinery.

57:32.237 --> 57:33.181
Right?

57:33.633 --> 57:34.435
Right.

58:20.262 --> 58:22.313
There is the door
that'll take us to the machinery.

58:28.426 --> 58:30.227
This is the Counts secret domain.

58:31.505 --> 58:33.283
The very heart of the phantom planer.

58:34.811 --> 58:37.382
From here he plan to control
the entire universe.

58:38.823 --> 58:39.980
This is incredible.

58:40.410 --> 58:41.466
Where is everybody?

58:41.855 --> 58:43.569
Everything is set in our destiny.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.811
Soon you'll know all the answers.

59:03.079 --> 59:05.039
This will take
us to operation headquarters.

59:14.253 --> 59:15.412
After you, my dear.

59:19.330 --> 59:21.695
Here's the nerve center
of the entire operation.

59:24.489 --> 59:25.727
This is unbelievable.

59:26.938 --> 59:28.025
Fantastic.

59:29.422 --> 59:32.287
Pre-programmed computers.
They could run forever.

59:32.955 --> 59:35.094
All these power modules,
what are they for?

59:35.844 --> 59:38.942
This is the force
that projected the red monsters into space.

59:39.890 --> 59:42.477
Then this is the way
they produced real monsters?

59:43.418 --> 59:45.045
No. Not real.

59:45.070 --> 59:46.910
The monsters never existed.

59:46.935 --> 59:50.816
These machines discharged mental
projections of monsters in our brains

59:51.413 --> 59:52.794
There's the control-panel.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.012
Well, destiny must take it's course.

01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:16.845
No, we can't allow this to happen.

01:00:17.283 --> 01:00:19.553
We must destroy it, at once.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.838
You've been very lucky.

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:47.520
And clever.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.320
You survived every trap
that I'd lay for you.

01:00:51.864 --> 01:00:55.864
Then I realized that your success
would become my triumph.

01:00:57.192 --> 01:00:58.759
How much time is left, Captain?

01:00:58.784 --> 01:01:00.514
Half a quadrant to go, My-lord.

01:01:03.724 --> 01:01:05.336
You hear?

01:01:05.665 --> 01:01:07.824
In less than an hours time

01:01:08.308 --> 01:01:10.435
All that'll be left of this planet

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.784
Will be ashes and cosmic dust.

01:01:13.934 --> 01:01:14.839
Forever.

01:01:16.567 --> 01:01:20.303
Then you will be among the dead.

01:01:21.702 --> 01:01:24.012
The emperor will make you pay for this.

01:01:24.037 --> 01:01:26.104
The Emperor?

01:01:26.668 --> 01:01:28.374
I forgot to inform you..

01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:33.911
..that the Emperor will be
blown to pieces along with the rest of you.

01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:35.983
Yes!

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.808
I told the emperor
that we had found you on this planet.

01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:44.221
He's on his way here now, at top speed.

01:01:45.419 --> 01:01:47.371
He'll get here just in time..

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.830
..to join the fireworks.

01:01:52.886 --> 01:01:54.814
I'm sorry, your highness.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.489
You've lost.

01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:57.799
Highness?

01:01:58.471 --> 01:01:59.535
Forgive me Stella.

01:02:00.638 --> 01:02:03.043
But in the beginning
I didn't know whose side you were on.

01:02:04.357 --> 01:02:07.262
And after-wards
I didn't know how to tell you

01:02:08.003 --> 01:02:10.884
Yes, he is Simon, son of the Emperor
and heir to the throne.

01:02:20.851 --> 01:02:25.938
You two are to prevent them
from leaving this room at all cost.

01:02:26.749 --> 01:02:29.638
You will stay with them until the end.

01:02:31.192 --> 01:02:32.446
Kill them..

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:34.350
..if you have to.

01:02:51.938 --> 01:02:54.580
Now it will be just a matter of waiting.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.516
An hour goes by quickly.

01:03:15.937 --> 01:03:18.055
We've got to get past those golems.

01:03:18.547 --> 01:03:19.697
Yes, but how?

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.106
Have faith.

01:03:27.131 --> 01:03:28.583
And never give up hope.

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:19.420
Look out!

01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:40.652
We are now approaching Demundia.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.765
All crewmen to landing stations.

01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:45.162
All crewmen to landing stations.

01:06:06.032 --> 01:06:08.160
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.637
You and the prince will live.

01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:13.988
Akton, you've got to get up.

01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:15.726
We must get away from here.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:19.690
I shall remain here.

01:06:20.135 --> 01:06:21.929
Please get up, please.

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:26.074
I'm no longer useful at this time.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.628
You're talking nonsense.
You can heal yourself in no time at all.

01:06:31.342 --> 01:06:32.326
No.

01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:35.297
I must obey destiny.

01:06:35.979 --> 01:06:37.000
Akton!

01:06:37.813 --> 01:06:39.027
We'll carry you.

01:06:39.353 --> 01:06:40.615
Go.

01:06:40.774 --> 01:06:42.338
It's your duty.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.861
You must live.

01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:49.696
I can't.

01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:50.942
I can't leave you.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.068
You're the only human-like
friend I ever had.

01:06:54.504 --> 01:06:56.964
I don't understand. You never die.

01:06:57.099 --> 01:06:58.797
Stella, Stella.

01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:00.685
I've accomplished the mission.

01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:01.806
Yes, but I..

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:05.626
Others are coming.
Even as I speak they'll rescue you.

01:07:07.586 --> 01:07:08.634
Don't worry.

01:07:11.245 --> 01:07:12.872
I'll live forever.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:15.996
Now go.

01:07:16.774 --> 01:07:17.711
Go.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.597
Father!

01:08:25.036 --> 01:08:26.520
We must leave at once.

01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:29.076
48 seconds left to the explosion.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.584
We've got to get out of here.

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:31.662
It's true father.

01:08:31.688 --> 01:08:34.143
The Count has mined the planet
with nuclear charges.

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:35.729
We're all about to die.

01:08:36.604 --> 01:08:38.160
You know something, my boy?

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:42.024
I wouldn't be emperor
if I didn't have some powers at my command.

01:08:48.093 --> 01:08:49.671
Imperial battle-ship!

01:08:51.575 --> 01:08:52.488
Holt..

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.970
..the flow of time.

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:06.251
In the space of 3 minutes

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:08.832
Every molecule on this planet
will be immobilized.

01:09:09.969 --> 01:09:11.524
But after the third minute

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.157
The green ray loses it's power.

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:15.255
Time will flow once again.

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:17.819
And everything will explode.

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:20.189
Three minutes are enough, father.

01:10:24.939 --> 01:10:26.868
Now, the Count believe that we are dead.

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:30.239
That our armies have dispersed.

01:10:30.264 --> 01:10:31.612
And that we have no leader.

01:10:33.047 --> 01:10:37.238
He is supremely confident that he can
overcome us with the greatest of ease.

01:10:39.185 --> 01:10:40.415
Well then.

01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:42.749
Now is the time to surprise him.

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:48.017
We will attack his headquarters

01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:51.319
before his fleets can join him.

01:10:52.446 --> 01:10:54.732
If we succeed in this

01:10:54.757 --> 01:10:56.867
we could save billions of lives.

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.972
Gather together all our legions.
Sir!

01:11:06.467 --> 01:11:08.094
And order the attack.

01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:55.414
By sunset,
I'll be the new Emperor.

01:12:56.092 --> 01:13:00.822
And I will be the master
of the whole universe.

01:13:58.037 --> 01:13:59.489
Kill them!

01:14:58.231 --> 01:14:59.921
Enemy arriving with torpedoes.

01:14:59.946 --> 01:15:01.429
Prepare for attack.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.293
Kill! Kill!

01:15:47.318 --> 01:15:48.611
Over there.

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:53.387
We've got them, father.
It's working

01:16:12.983 --> 01:16:13.991
Kill!

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:15.030
Kill!

01:17:48.628 --> 01:17:49.739
Kill them!

01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:19.652
Let's squad. Come on

01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:24.481
Over there, quickly.

01:19:05.394 --> 01:19:08.108
Now let's give the Emperor

01:19:08.133 --> 01:19:09.957
a great reception.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.727
Put in use the mightiest weapon.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.691
The doom-machine.

01:19:15.738 --> 01:19:19.730
Send it off to towards
the Emperor's capital world

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:23.516
and destroy the emperor's imperial planet.

01:19:23.919 --> 01:19:27.085
Zarth-Arn!!
Yeah!

01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:29.490
It's over.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:32.759
We're finished.

01:19:35.418 --> 01:19:36.783
We've lost.

01:19:40.093 --> 01:19:40.998
No.

01:19:43.441 --> 01:19:45.457
No, there's still a way.

01:19:46.211 --> 01:19:47.957
There's one solution left.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.508
I'm afraid we're forced to use it.

01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:52.556
What?

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.765
Starcrash!

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.892
Four dimensional attack.

01:19:59.551 --> 01:20:00.360
Yes!

01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:02.976
If we can re-enter space

01:20:03.001 --> 01:20:06.140
at the precise moment

01:20:06.165 --> 01:20:10.535
the impact of surprise upon the Count
will be so overwhelming

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.618
that he cannot halt us.

01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:14.976
But father,
there is not a weapon powerful enough.

01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:16.540
Oh yes, there is.

01:20:17.159 --> 01:20:18.651
The floating city.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.965
The floating city.

01:20:21.173 --> 01:20:22.372
Yes, yes I know.

01:20:23.212 --> 01:20:26.879
Although we destroy it's
hope, it's future..

01:20:27.812 --> 01:20:29.637
..I'm afraid we must sacrifice it.

01:20:29.662 --> 01:20:33.287
By setting it towards the Count's fortress.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.913
It's our only way.

01:20:41.489 --> 01:20:43.250
Now you must help me.

01:20:47.353 --> 01:20:48.773
Both of you.

01:20:50.602 --> 01:20:51.285
Go!

01:20:51.453 --> 01:20:52.986
And direct it's course.

01:21:11.693 --> 01:21:12.407
Zoltan!

01:21:12.915 --> 01:21:13.804
Yes, my-lord.

01:21:14.379 --> 01:21:18.600
Now set the doom-machine
against the imperial space station itself.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.450
How long will it take?

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.213
15 minutes.

01:21:21.238 --> 01:21:22.721
The set it in motion.

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:26.118
I want to wipe out the Emperor
from the whole of the universe.

01:21:26.777 --> 01:21:27.785
Yes, my-lord.

01:21:31.533 --> 01:21:33.477
When do we reach the floating city?

01:21:33.502 --> 01:21:34.819
In less than 2 minutes.

01:21:34.844 --> 01:21:37.065
Right. I'll check the docking facility.

01:21:38.057 --> 01:21:38.708
Right!

01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:52.680
Everything checks out OK.

01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:54.831
Look!

01:21:54.856 --> 01:21:56.013
The floating city.

01:21:56.038 --> 01:21:57.307
Already evacuated.

01:21:57.719 --> 01:22:00.775
The technicians have already set the
charges and freed the atomic engines.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.687
If everything goes smoothly

01:22:02.712 --> 01:22:06.006
I'll try to eject myself
as soon as I re-enter space.

01:22:06.582 --> 01:22:07.792
But surely I'll come with you!

01:22:07.817 --> 01:22:08.864
No, no, no!

01:22:08.889 --> 01:22:11.983
It's more important that you stay here
to rescue me once this is all over.

01:22:14.419 --> 01:22:15.324
Alright.

01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:16.999
I'll stay.

01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:19.110
But I cannot let you go alone.

01:22:20.086 --> 01:22:22.185
In fact our best scientists
have spent the last

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.308
few hours reconstructing
an old friend of yours.

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:29.446
Elle!

01:22:31.367 --> 01:22:33.692
You can't keep a good robot down.

01:22:36.312 --> 01:22:38.637
This is incredible, they rebuild you.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:40.494
But how?
You look marvelous.

01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:42.145
Very carefully.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.153
And they used the latest components.

01:22:44.178 --> 01:22:46.422
I feel like a new machine.

01:22:46.447 --> 01:22:47.709
Go now. Quickly!

01:22:47.734 --> 01:22:49.702
The survival of our galaxy
is in your hands.

01:23:26.424 --> 01:23:29.426
This will take us directly
to the control-room.

01:23:29.759 --> 01:23:32.521
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

01:23:39.197 --> 01:23:41.237
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

01:23:45.952 --> 01:23:47.928
This doesn't make you nervous, does it?

01:23:48.261 --> 01:23:49.960
I've never flown a city before.

01:23:50.468 --> 01:23:52.047
Well, leave it to me.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.440
Build up maximum energy.

01:24:31.465 --> 01:24:33.924
We must leap
through the very heart of the stars.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.137
Prepare to transit. 8 degrees.

01:24:47.341 --> 01:24:48.683
Ok. I'm ready.

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:07.092
My-lord!

01:25:07.497 --> 01:25:08.382
Yes Ellrik?

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:10.986
A floating ship is about to crash into us.

01:25:11.011 --> 01:25:11.732
What?

01:25:12.542 --> 01:25:13.550
Zoltan!

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:14.883
Yes my-lord.

01:25:15.251 --> 01:25:17.799
Destroy the floating ship approaching us.

01:25:22.347 --> 01:25:23.945
It can't be done.

01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:25.016
It's too close.

01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:27.639
There it is. Dead-ahead.
Alright!

01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:31.309
The Count's fighters.
We've got to evade them.

01:25:34.426 --> 01:25:37.022
All systems prepare for full power.

01:26:05.088 --> 01:26:06.905
Let's lock in these controls.

01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.606
Move it out. Quick.

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:09.495
Right!

01:26:10.067 --> 01:26:10.805
Let's go!

01:26:29.437 --> 01:26:31.643
Come back, you fools.
You cowards.

01:26:31.668 --> 01:26:32.897
Come back and fight.

01:26:32.922 --> 01:26:33.818
My-lord?
Yes!

01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:35.247
Come, or you'll be destroyed.

01:26:35.272 --> 01:26:36.694
You stay here.
Go!

01:26:41.455 --> 01:26:45.035
Let's get out of here or there won't be
enough left of me to put back together.

01:26:45.413 --> 01:26:46.484
You can bet on that!

01:26:49.364 --> 01:26:51.182
Circuits, don't fail me now.

01:27:07.362 --> 01:27:10.462
Zarth-Arn!! Zarth-Arn!!

01:28:26.544 --> 01:28:29.329
It's Simon. Simon!

01:28:29.968 --> 01:28:31.127
We're over here.

01:28:36.085 --> 01:28:37.767
Stella. Stella!

01:28:40.652 --> 01:28:42.113
And welcome home.

01:28:58.747 --> 01:28:59.628
Stella!

01:28:59.653 --> 01:29:00.462
Simon!

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:01.961
Ah Stella.

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:03.614
Simon.

01:29:06.368 --> 01:29:08.002
Is that so.

01:29:08.027 --> 01:29:10.003
Well..
It's done

01:29:10.892 --> 01:29:11.836
It's happened.

01:29:13.357 --> 01:29:15.675
The stars are clear.

01:29:17.379 --> 01:29:19.213
The planets shine.

01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:23.229
We've won.

01:29:25.624 --> 01:29:29.536
Oh, some dark force no doubt

01:29:29.561 --> 01:29:31.298
Will show it's face once more.

01:29:33.139 --> 01:29:36.289
The wheel will always turn.

01:29:39.686 --> 01:29:40.964
But for now it's calm.

01:29:44.276 --> 01:29:45.514
And for a little time..

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:47.554
..at least..

01:29:50.583 --> 01:29:52.161
..we can rest.
