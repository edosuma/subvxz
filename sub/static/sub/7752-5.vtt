<i>Previously on "Devious Maids"... </i>

00:01.744 --> 00:04.230
Here's to being pregnant and
getting left at the altar.

00:04.378 --> 00:05.711
I can't believe Javi left you

00:05.746 --> 00:07.213
just because you're
carrying another man's baby

00:07.248 --> 00:09.049
and tried to pass it off as his.

00:09.083 --> 00:12.017
You can stay here with
the baby, where you belong.

00:12.052 --> 00:15.854
You are the most beautiful
woman I have ever met,

00:15.888 --> 00:17.022
and I have fallen in love with you.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.024
They told me you were killed.

00:19.359 --> 00:20.559
But I'm back now.

00:20.593 --> 00:24.396
We will all be one big, happy family.

00:24.430 --> 00:25.664
Men are bad.

00:25.698 --> 00:27.866
We deserve to be punished. [Sighs]

00:27.900 --> 00:29.199
Carmen, that's a sex thing.

00:29.234 --> 00:30.601
He said he'd pay me to do it again.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.503
I don't want this man anywhere near you.

00:32.537 --> 00:34.071
This place is a disaster zone.

00:34.105 --> 00:35.172
Maybe you should hire a maid.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.841
MARISOL: He works for me now.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.676
He's an absolute professional.

00:38.710 --> 00:39.877
BLANCA: What the hell happened in here?

00:39.911 --> 00:41.512
Did you kill him?

00:41.546 --> 00:43.681
You know, I've been trying
to call Blanca. Is she home?

00:43.715 --> 00:46.015
She quit. Yeah. She took
off while we were at dinner.

00:46.049 --> 00:47.450
She didn't even leave a note.

00:47.485 --> 00:49.285
I am not having an affair.

00:49.319 --> 00:52.221
Sooner or later, I'm going
to find out the truth.

00:52.256 --> 00:54.791
I think tonight's the night.

00:54.825 --> 00:57.360
We pulled prints from the
hand found in your garden,

00:57.395 --> 00:58.561
and we've been able to identify the victim.

00:58.596 --> 01:00.096
That's Louie Becker.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.431
He was involved with a friend of mine.

01:01.465 --> 01:02.631
This friend of yours what's her name?

01:02.665 --> 01:04.299
Are you Genevieve Delatour?

01:04.333 --> 01:06.535
I need to speak to you about
the murder of Louie Becker.

01:08.304 --> 01:09.571
[Doorbell rings]

01:12.341 --> 01:14.910
Oh, thank God you're here.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.311
[Door closes]

01:16.345 --> 01:17.646
Genevieve hasn't said anything, has she?

01:17.680 --> 01:19.281
No, we've been waiting for you.

01:19.315 --> 01:21.215
I figured she shouldn't
answer any questions

01:21.249 --> 01:23.083
- without her lawyer present.
- That's smart.

01:23.118 --> 01:26.120
So she's been hiding in the
bathroom for the last 40 minutes.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.922
That sounds about right.

01:27.956 --> 01:31.492
Mrs. Delatour, what was your
relationship with Mr. Becker?

01:31.527 --> 01:33.795
He was the tennis pro at our club.

01:33.829 --> 01:36.463
Such a tragedy what happened.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.498
- [Whispers] How was that?
- [Whispers] That was fine.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.766
You can stop asking.

01:39.801 --> 01:40.934
Oh.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.336
It's my first murder investigation.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.639
I was told you and the
deceased were lovers.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.273
What?! [Chuckles] That's ridiculous.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.008
If they were lovers, I'd know about it.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.678
[Chuckles] Well, there you have it.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.512
You didn't answer the question.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.780
Really? I thought I did.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.281
Oh, for God's sake,

01:56.316 --> 01:58.617
tell the detective you
did not have an affair

01:58.652 --> 01:59.852
with the murdered man.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.187
Well...

02:02.221 --> 02:05.257
You slept with your tennis pro?

02:05.291 --> 02:06.492
How long was this going on?

02:06.526 --> 02:10.329
Ma'am, I'll ask the questions here.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.964
H... how long <i>was</i> this going on?

02:12.998 --> 02:14.499
Just a few months.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.767
It wasn't a big deal.

02:15.801 --> 02:17.268
But I was told it ended badly.

02:17.302 --> 02:18.803
What happened between you two?

02:18.838 --> 02:22.306
Um... pass.

02:22.341 --> 02:24.342
Excuse me? You can't do that.

02:24.376 --> 02:26.711
Actually, my client has every
right <i>not</i> to answer,

02:26.745 --> 02:27.845
so let's move on.

02:27.879 --> 02:29.680
Yes.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.015
Why don't you go pester someone
else, like Evelyn Powell?

02:32.049 --> 02:33.684
She was always flirting with Louie.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.185
I'll check that out.

02:35.219 --> 02:36.687
Now, we've determined

02:36.721 --> 02:38.555
the murder took place the night of the 1st.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.990
Where were you?

02:40.024 --> 02:41.625
At a book party.

02:41.659 --> 02:43.059
For my friend Marisol.

02:43.094 --> 02:44.361
I remember.

02:44.395 --> 02:47.630
And, Michael, you saw me there. Tell him.

02:47.664 --> 02:50.232
Yes, my wife and I talked to her.

02:50.266 --> 02:51.834
Then it's settled.

02:51.869 --> 02:53.135
I'm innocent.

02:53.169 --> 02:55.471
Thank you so much for coming by.

02:55.506 --> 02:57.473
It's just I still don't understand

02:57.508 --> 02:59.074
the circumstances of your breakup.

02:59.109 --> 03:01.343
We didn't have a lot in common.

03:01.378 --> 03:05.380
I'm delightful, and he's
a slimy, little weasel.

03:05.414 --> 03:07.849
May he rest in peace.

03:07.884 --> 03:09.217
Sounds like you didn't like him very much.

03:09.251 --> 03:10.685
I didn't.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.321
- Genevieve.
- The truth is, I loathed him.

03:13.355 --> 03:16.057
But I won't demean myself
by standing here and...

03:16.091 --> 03:18.559
and explaining why to the likes of you.

03:18.593 --> 03:20.828
If you don't like that, you
can arrest me, Detective!

03:20.862 --> 03:24.832
But I have said all I am going to say!

The laundry.

03:50.257 --> 03:51.925
You're 20 minutes early.

03:51.959 --> 03:54.192
Well, I figured I'd get a
head start on some things.

03:54.226 --> 03:55.694
Is that a problem?

03:55.728 --> 03:59.064
Y... No, I just... I'm
not ready for you... ouch.

03:59.098 --> 04:02.100
I haven't gotten dressed, and
I haven't even put on makeup.

04:02.134 --> 04:05.403
So this is you just rolling out of bed?

04:05.438 --> 04:08.106
Yeah.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.541
Hmm.

04:09.575 --> 04:11.108
Uh, you know what?

04:11.142 --> 04:13.611
I'll, um, I'll take care of these.

04:13.645 --> 04:15.112
Your panties?

04:15.146 --> 04:18.815
They're underwear, and I
prefer to fold them myself.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.651
I've got two sisters and a mother.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.319
You think I've never seen panties?

[Chuckles] Whatever you want.

I am here to service you.

04:28.459 --> 04:29.826
No, no.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.795
Okay, you can't talk like...

04:31.829 --> 04:34.664
Um, I know what you
meant to say, but it's...

04:34.699 --> 04:37.166
it's not professional to, um...

04:37.201 --> 04:38.468
No, I got you.

04:38.502 --> 04:39.669
Don't worry.

04:41.205 --> 04:43.339
Uh, there... there are some things I
would like you to take care of this week.

04:43.373 --> 04:46.008
Uh, organize the pantry,
clean the air vents.

04:46.042 --> 04:47.643
I'm on it.

04:47.677 --> 04:49.244
Thanks. I'll be upstairs.

04:49.278 --> 04:50.579
Oh! One more thing.

04:50.614 --> 04:53.916
Did you want me to hand-wash these?

04:57.053 --> 04:59.121
I'll take care of the laundry.

05:02.390 --> 05:05.994
Thank you for letting
me borrow your furniture.

05:06.028 --> 05:07.862
You should thank Spence.

05:07.896 --> 05:09.631
It all belongs to him.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.634
Oh, I thought it was yours
'cause everything is so small.

05:12.668 --> 05:14.636

Hey, that happens to be a very
expensive, very classic piece.

05:21.509 --> 05:22.843
I'm sorry, man.

05:22.877 --> 05:24.044
There's nothing wrong with your chair.

05:24.078 --> 05:25.612
It's my fault. I'm too tall.

05:27.581 --> 05:28.782
Damn it!

05:28.816 --> 05:30.517

05:30.551 --> 05:31.551

- Uh-huh?
- With the wedding.

- Mm-hmm.
- And the coma.

It'll be good for you. Come on, <i>mijo.</i>

06:12.256 --> 06:15.859
Let's get some more little
furniture from the truck, huh?

06:15.894 --> 06:17.494
[Chuckles] That's good? Come on.

06:20.932 --> 06:22.666
What?

06:22.701 --> 06:26.335
Miguel and I go to the park on
Sundays, hang out, shoot hoops.

06:26.369 --> 06:28.370
We've been doing it since you were in
the hospital. It's kind of our thing.

06:28.405 --> 06:31.040
Oh, uh, I didn't realize.

06:31.075 --> 06:32.608
I will talk to Ernesto.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.910
Good.

06:33.944 --> 06:36.045
But you have to do something, too.

06:37.414 --> 06:40.850
You can't criticize
Ernesto in front of Miguel.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.351
It's disrespectful.

06:42.385 --> 06:45.453
Ernesto doesn't respect <i>me.</i>

06:45.487 --> 06:47.222
He's ragging on my furniture, my height.

06:47.256 --> 06:49.191
So he's taller than you.

06:49.225 --> 06:52.393
You can still be the bigger man, hmm?

<i>whether or not the victim knew... </i>

07:12.874 --> 07:15.142
[Sighs] I was watching that.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.643
It's such an awful story.

07:16.678 --> 07:19.345
I don't want Katy
accidentally listening to it.

07:19.379 --> 07:21.214
I need to know what's going on.

07:21.248 --> 07:23.950
Police questioned Genevieve last night.

07:23.984 --> 07:25.618
She's a person of interest in the case.

07:27.087 --> 07:28.788
Oh, my God.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.356
You... you think she had
something to do with it?

07:30.390 --> 07:32.692
No, I don't.

07:32.726 --> 07:35.360
But she had a relationship with Louie.

07:35.394 --> 07:39.164
I guess he had affairs with a
lot of the women at the club.

07:39.199 --> 07:40.632
Really? [Scoffs]

07:42.335 --> 07:45.704
Well, I hadn't heard that. [Sighs]

07:45.738 --> 07:47.572
You knew Louie, right?

07:47.606 --> 07:49.541
I took a few lessons from him.

07:50.676 --> 07:52.409
But I didn't have an affair with him,

07:52.444 --> 07:54.078
if that's what you're suggesting.

07:54.112 --> 07:55.913
I wasn't.

07:55.948 --> 07:57.715
Police said Louie was murdered

07:57.749 --> 08:00.885
the night of Marisol's book
party, same night I left town.

08:00.919 --> 08:03.554
Do you remember anything from that night?

08:03.588 --> 08:07.358
Uh, it... it was, uh, it was a quiet night.

08:07.392 --> 08:11.828
Uh, you'd gone to the airport,
and Katy and I went to bed.

08:13.898 --> 08:16.032
What about Blanca? Didn't
she move in that night?

08:16.067 --> 08:18.368
Blanca? That was the same night?

08:19.636 --> 08:22.405
I don't really remember.

- No.

08:25.275 --> 08:28.577
Honestly, Michael, I try
not to think about Blanca.

08:28.611 --> 08:30.045
Why's that?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.446
Because she wasn't a good fit.

the whole thing, okay?

09:13.021 --> 09:14.421
from your married paramour.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.956
He's really mad about
me doing this with you.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.457
He wrote it in all caps.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.659
Who is this mystery lover of yours, anyway?

09:20.693 --> 09:21.994
You must tell me.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.063
That's none of your business!

09:24.097 --> 09:25.398
Sorry.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.800
Carmen, there is nothing less appealing

09:27.834 --> 09:29.902
than an apologetic dominatrix.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.305
Fine. I'm not sorry. But I'm
also not talking about him.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.438
Why not? Do I know him?

09:35.308 --> 09:36.441
Shut your mouth!

09:36.475 --> 09:38.776
I  <i>do</i> know him.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.779
Well, I imagine he must be very handsome.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.181
You wouldn't be dating a troll.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.083
Shut it, dog!

09:45.117 --> 09:46.151
Now, that's more like it.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.989
And, Mistress, please <i>don't</i> be gentle.

09:59.203 --> 10:01.538
Oh, how thoughtful. You brought me lunch.

10:01.572 --> 10:04.173
Genevieve, I'm worried about you.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.909
I'm fine.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.811
You're a person of interest
in a murder investigation.

10:08.845 --> 10:09.912
That's not fine.

10:09.946 --> 10:12.047
Oh, well. It'll blow over.

10:12.081 --> 10:14.383
Come on. You're freaking out.

10:14.418 --> 10:16.585
Talk to me.

10:16.620 --> 10:19.221
What went on between you and Louie?

10:20.356 --> 10:21.557
I can't.

10:21.591 --> 10:23.358
It's too awful.

10:23.393 --> 10:26.561
It can't be worse than murder.

10:26.595 --> 10:29.063
Can it?

10:32.034 --> 10:34.035
Louie and I...

10:34.069 --> 10:35.904
made a sex tape.

10:35.938 --> 10:37.505
[Gasps]

10:37.540 --> 10:38.940
Oh, my God.

10:38.974 --> 10:40.542
But that's not the awful part.

10:40.576 --> 10:42.375
- It's not?
- No!

10:42.410 --> 10:44.578
I'm not ashamed of my body. You know that.

10:44.612 --> 10:46.547
You've seen me naked dozens of times.

10:46.581 --> 10:49.382
I know. I keep buying you robes,
but you never get the hint.

10:49.417 --> 10:54.788
On this video, Louie and I
tried something... different.

10:54.823 --> 10:56.723
I don't like where this is going.

10:57.992 --> 11:00.460
It's called the Blooming Orchid.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.295
It's a sex position.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.798
And you have to be quite limber to do it.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.233
[Groans] You're right. This
<i>is</i> worse than murder.

11:08.268 --> 11:13.906
Louie showed the video to
his friends at the club.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.942
[Sighs] Naturally, I was
furious when I found out.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.743
I can imagine.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.913
Even though I'm trying really,
<i>really</i> hard not to.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.617
The idea of his friends
gawking over it... Ugh!

11:25.651 --> 11:26.751
I was mortified.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.053
- Tell that to the police.
- No!

11:29.088 --> 11:32.590
If word gets out, I'll be a laughingstock.

11:32.624 --> 11:34.758
And what about Christopher?

11:34.793 --> 11:37.595
- We've only just started dating.
- So?

11:37.629 --> 11:41.164
So, I'm already declining
his invitation to Greece.

11:41.199 --> 11:44.969
If he hears about the Blooming Orchid,

11:45.003 --> 11:46.804
he may never get over it.

11:46.838 --> 11:50.306
Are you really willing to
risk going to jail over this?

11:50.340 --> 11:51.574
Let me help you.

11:51.609 --> 11:54.110
That's my lawyer's job.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.746
Your job is to be my friend

11:56.780 --> 11:59.015
and take this secret to your grave.

12:03.954 --> 12:05.488
ERNESTO: <i>Quien es?</i>

12:05.523 --> 12:08.023
It's me... Rosie.

12:08.057 --> 12:10.358
<i>iPasale!</i> It's open.

12:13.362 --> 12:14.630
Ernesto?

12:14.664 --> 12:16.331
I'll be right there.

12:16.365 --> 12:19.034
I want to talk to you about Sunday.

12:19.068 --> 12:20.301
What about it?

12:20.336 --> 12:22.203
Ooh.

12:24.039 --> 12:25.940
Huh?

12:25.974 --> 12:27.141
Sunday.

12:27.175 --> 12:29.309
Sunday what?

12:29.344 --> 12:31.145
You wanted to talk to me about it.

12:32.414 --> 12:33.814
Yes, uh...

12:33.849 --> 12:36.216
Maybe you should put some clothes on first.

12:36.251 --> 12:38.218
Oh. I was about to take a shower.

12:38.253 --> 12:40.654
I got sweaty moving boxes all day.

12:40.688 --> 12:42.388
Oh, that must have been so...

12:43.691 --> 12:45.158
What?

12:46.427 --> 12:49.029
I forget the word in English.

12:49.063 --> 12:50.329
<i>En Español?</i>

12:50.364 --> 12:53.900
I forget the word in Spanish, too.

12:53.935 --> 12:55.835
Are you all right?

12:55.870 --> 12:58.671
Uh, Spence has plans with Miguel on Sunday.

12:58.705 --> 13:00.839
You can't take him to church then.

13:00.874 --> 13:02.407
Okay.

13:02.442 --> 13:03.909
We can go Saturday night.

13:03.944 --> 13:06.579
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.613 --> 13:08.013
That was easy.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.514
What can I say?

13:09.549 --> 13:10.649
I'm easy.

13:11.785 --> 13:13.886
Yes, well...

13:13.920 --> 13:17.254
He will be very happy.

13:17.289 --> 13:19.724
Spence.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.226
My husband.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.261
Do you think I don't know who Spence is?

13:25.564 --> 13:27.431
I have to go.

13:31.570 --> 13:35.105
EVELYN: No, Detective, thank <i>you.</i>

13:35.139 --> 13:37.207
Of course. I will be right down.

13:37.241 --> 13:38.274
[Cellphone beeps]

13:38.309 --> 13:39.375
Who was that?

13:39.410 --> 13:41.011
The police.

13:41.045 --> 13:43.113
It seems our severed leg

13:43.147 --> 13:46.750
belonged to the tennis pro from the club.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.251
Oh, no.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.952
Well, I hope this won't
affect our monthly dues.

13:49.987 --> 13:52.421
Anyway, the detective wants to speak to me.

13:52.455 --> 13:54.389
I'll be gone for a couple hours.

13:54.424 --> 13:55.691
I'll try not to get into any trouble.

14:01.732 --> 14:03.733
[Door opens]

14:05.102 --> 14:07.702
Marisol! What a surprise.

14:07.737 --> 14:09.871
I'm afraid I was just leaving.

14:09.905 --> 14:11.472
Oh, well, I was just in the area.

14:11.507 --> 14:13.574
I thought I'd stop by to see
how Carmen is working out.

14:13.609 --> 14:15.610
Well, now that you ask,

14:15.645 --> 14:18.613
Carmen is not what I would call... good.

14:18.648 --> 14:20.481
[Sighs] I'm sorry to hear that.

14:20.516 --> 14:22.650
All maids are varying
degrees of disappointing,

14:22.684 --> 14:25.218
but I think this one actually
collects dust from other homes

14:25.253 --> 14:26.787
and sprinkles it around ours.

14:26.821 --> 14:28.455
[Laughs] I will talk to her.

14:28.489 --> 14:29.823
Also, her ironing is horrific.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.458
If she ruins one more silk blouse...

14:31.492 --> 14:33.593
I'll handle it. She inside?

14:33.628 --> 14:35.763
Well, it's before noon.
She's probably still in bed.

14:35.797 --> 14:37.731
Try the pool house. Mwah.

14:42.502 --> 14:45.071
- [Whip cracking]
- [Adrian grunting]

14:59.351 --> 15:01.252
- [Whip cracks]
- Oh!

15:01.287 --> 15:03.088
Oh, I've been so very bad.

15:03.122 --> 15:04.589
Yes!

15:04.623 --> 15:05.857
Oh!

15:05.892 --> 15:07.759
Yes! Thank you!

15:14.513 --> 15:17.349
What can I do for you, Detective?

15:17.383 --> 15:19.550
I need to ask about your
relationship with Louie Becker.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.619
I had no relationship with him

15:21.653 --> 15:24.155
beyond polite conversation at the club.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.892
And his disembodied tibia in my flower bed.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.960
Apparently Mr. Becker had a
reputation as a ladies' man. Mm.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.496
It's been suggested you
might have flirted with him.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.131
I'm sorry.

15:34.165 --> 15:37.167
It sounds like you think I
had motive to murder Louie.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.536
- Did you?
- Of course not!

15:39.570 --> 15:41.305
Who gave you that ridiculous idea?

15:41.339 --> 15:43.040
I'm not at liberty to say.

15:43.074 --> 15:45.209
Well, it must have been
someone from the club.

15:45.243 --> 15:47.377
- Tanya Taseltof?
- I think I have enough here.

15:47.411 --> 15:49.379
- Gail Fleming?
- Please, Mrs. Powell.

15:49.413 --> 15:50.746
Genevieve Delatour?

15:50.781 --> 15:53.549
Oh. I can't say.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.652
Oh, that skinny, little hag.

15:56.686 --> 15:58.421
I'm gonna murder her.

15:59.556 --> 16:02.358
That was a figure of speech.

16:02.393 --> 16:04.359
[Knock on door]

16:04.394 --> 16:06.761
Hello. Can I help you?

16:06.796 --> 16:07.996
Who are you?

16:08.031 --> 16:09.764
I'm Jesse. I'm Marisol's maid.

16:09.799 --> 16:12.234
Okay.

16:12.268 --> 16:13.568
I'm confused.

16:13.602 --> 16:15.037
[Chuckles] It's crazy, right?

16:15.071 --> 16:17.605
I clean houses, and I'm a man.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.042
Yes, you are.

16:20.076 --> 16:21.208
[Chuckles]

16:21.243 --> 16:22.276
Is she home?

16:22.311 --> 16:24.245
She is. Please come in.

16:27.482 --> 16:29.283
Marisol, you have a guest!

16:29.318 --> 16:30.418
It is...

16:30.452 --> 16:33.354
Carmen. Carmen Luna.

16:34.089 --> 16:36.424
Carmen, my office. Now.

16:40.328 --> 16:42.462
[Camera shutter clicks]

16:46.767 --> 16:48.101
I saw you.

16:48.135 --> 16:50.470
Saw what? I took a picture. Big deal.

16:50.504 --> 16:51.904
Not that.

16:51.939 --> 16:53.940
I saw you at the Powell house.

16:53.975 --> 16:56.108
In a leather jumpsuit

16:56.142 --> 17:00.645
treating Adrian Powell like
he was a... bad cocker spaniel.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.214
Oh, God.

17:02.248 --> 17:05.550
Why the hell would you agree
to do something like that?

17:05.585 --> 17:06.785
Mr. Powell asked me.

17:06.819 --> 17:07.886
And you said <i>yes?</i>

17:07.920 --> 17:09.154
Well, not at first.

17:09.189 --> 17:10.722
But one day I was really mad at Sebastien,

17:10.756 --> 17:12.457
and I really wanted to hit someone...

17:12.491 --> 17:14.724
Then take a kickboxing class!

17:14.759 --> 17:16.594
You don't beat up your boss.

17:16.627 --> 17:21.632
I know, Marisol, but he paid me
extra, and he gave me shoes...

17:21.665 --> 17:24.667
- Carmen!
- Okay, you're right! You're right!

17:24.703 --> 17:26.471
I don't know what I was thinking.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.738
I'll stop.

17:27.771 --> 17:30.907
- Okay. Good.
- [Sighs]

17:30.941 --> 17:34.811
'Cause employers and employees
need to have boundaries.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.079
You understand?

17:36.114 --> 17:38.181
You're one to talk.

17:38.216 --> 17:40.017
What's that mean?

17:40.051 --> 17:42.352
Like you hired that beautiful
man because he's a good maid?

17:42.387 --> 17:44.287
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

17:45.556 --> 17:46.788
You think he's attractive?

17:47.724 --> 17:49.525
[Scoffs] I hadn't noticed.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.593
<i>Mentirosa. You noticed.</i>

17:51.628 --> 17:53.595
You'd have to be dead not to notice.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.331
Okay, fine.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.766
He's gorgeous. You happy?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.701
Every time I see him,
I have to remind myself

17:59.736 --> 18:01.303
to look in his eyes and not in his chest.

18:01.338 --> 18:04.039
- [Chuckles]
- JESSE: Marisol?

18:05.241 --> 18:06.874
Jesse?

18:06.909 --> 18:10.045
Yeah, um, I'm cleaning the
air vents like you asked,

18:10.079 --> 18:15.616
and just so you know,
I can hear... everything.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.557
Okay.

18:23.591 --> 18:24.891
Thanks for the heads-up.

18:29.597 --> 18:30.664
[Laughs]

18:30.698 --> 18:33.233
[Sighs]

18:44.010 --> 18:45.178
Mommy?

18:45.212 --> 18:46.812
Yes, my love?

18:46.846 --> 18:48.881
Are you sick?

18:48.915 --> 18:50.516
No, not at all.

18:50.551 --> 18:54.386
Then why are you taking medicine?

18:56.589 --> 18:57.722
Uh...

18:59.258 --> 19:03.395
Because sometimes grownups get sad,

19:03.429 --> 19:08.433
and these pills make us feel happy again.

19:08.468 --> 19:10.602
But they are not for kids.

19:10.636 --> 19:13.437
You understand?

19:13.472 --> 19:15.872
Now, you know what would
really make me feel better?

19:17.109 --> 19:18.576
A hug. Come here.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.953
Have you ever heard of a sex position

19:30.988 --> 19:32.855
called the Blooming Orchid?

19:32.889 --> 19:35.525
<i>Sucia! You did that?</i>

19:35.559 --> 19:37.760
I had no idea you were so freaky.

19:37.794 --> 19:39.429
Wasn't me.

19:39.463 --> 19:41.931
It was... a friend.

19:41.965 --> 19:44.234
You know, you really shouldn't
try that while you're pregnant.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.701
It wasn't me. Look...

19:48.304 --> 19:52.241
You promise not to tell
anybody what I'm about to say.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.542
Of course.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.478
Genevieve made a sex tape.

19:56.513 --> 19:59.814
[Chuckling] Oh... my God.

19:59.849 --> 20:01.283
<i>Escándalo!</i>

20:01.317 --> 20:03.484
It was with that tennis
pro who got murdered.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.919
And he showed it to some
of his friends at the club.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.389
Genevieve is so embarrassed.

20:08.423 --> 20:09.457
I would be, too.

20:09.491 --> 20:11.058
The Blooming Orchid?

At her age? Hmm.

20:12.427 --> 20:14.395
Well, what is it? You have to tell me.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.430
Okay, it's when a woman
wraps her leg and...

20:16.465 --> 20:18.132
- EVELYN: Carmen!
- Crap. I got to go.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.766
What? No!

20:19.800 --> 20:23.102
Your derelict ironing has
ruined my very favorite blouse.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.437
Please give me one good reason

We can't do this.

I used to make you feel?

21:20.191 --> 21:22.192
I remember.

21:22.227 --> 21:25.395
I can do that for you again.

coffee for free at your house?

22:20.974 --> 22:23.774
You know the coffee at my place
still costs <i>me</i> money, right?

22:23.809 --> 22:25.276
I also like your chairs better.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.378
Well, we're not going to my place.

So now I don't know what to say to him.

22:52.503 --> 22:54.238
[Sighs] You're right.

22:54.272 --> 22:58.307
I just have to be an adult
and own up to it and apologize,

22:58.342 --> 23:00.076
and then I can just put
this whole thing to bed.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.677
Maybe you should ask him out.

23:01.711 --> 23:02.811
What?!

23:02.846 --> 23:04.713
I can't do that. He's my maid.

23:04.748 --> 23:07.149
So? I dated Spence when I was his maid,

23:07.184 --> 23:08.684
and look how that turned out.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.353
You got shot at your wedding.

23:10.387 --> 23:13.188
Well, until then, it was good.

23:13.222 --> 23:14.522
Well, I can't date Jesse.

23:14.556 --> 23:16.191
Not only does he work for me,

23:16.225 --> 23:18.193
but he is also 10 years younger than I am.

23:18.227 --> 23:19.327
At least.

23:20.963 --> 23:24.165
The point is, he wouldn't
even be interested in me,

23:24.200 --> 23:25.934
and besides, he's not my type.

23:25.968 --> 23:27.068
Not your type?

23:27.103 --> 23:28.370
Marisol, look at your ex-husbands.

23:28.404 --> 23:29.871
You've always pick "the right guy,"

23:29.905 --> 23:31.738

wrong guy for once in your life.

Okay, well, I appreciate
the advice, ladies.

You're not gonna listen
to a word we said, are you?

23:45.220 --> 23:46.953
No, I'm not.

Ah. Good afternoon, Mrs. Powell.

23:54.061 --> 23:57.563
Hello... you.

23:57.597 --> 24:00.533
Forgive me, but I've been asking around,

24:00.567 --> 24:03.236
and I understand you were
friends with Louie Becker.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.569
Good friends.

24:04.603 --> 24:06.138
I still can't believe he's gone.

24:06.172 --> 24:07.739
Yes. Yeah.

24:07.773 --> 24:09.374
So tragic.

24:12.078 --> 24:17.715
Did he ever share a video
with you of a... sexual nature?

24:17.750 --> 24:20.785
I don't feel comfortable
talking about that.

24:20.820 --> 24:28.960
Well, how much will it take
to make you comfortable?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.767
Oh, she's out, fortunately.

Uh, I have a, uh, specific
request for our new home.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.673
And I don't think she would approve.

24:43.707 --> 24:45.575
[Chuckles] Why is that?

24:45.609 --> 24:48.578
I need a certain kind of room.

Dark, private, soundproof.

24:52.683 --> 24:54.150
Sort of like a...

- Precisely.

24:56.552 --> 24:58.320
Well, you picked up on that rather quickly.

24:58.355 --> 24:59.955
Very good at my job.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.191
I'd be more than willing to
renovate a roomy basement,

25:02.225 --> 25:04.460
- perhaps a wine cellar.
- I'll look into it.

it wasn't because of you.

I was hoping that you could, uh,

26:45.989 --> 26:47.790
help me get in touch with Blanca.

26:47.824 --> 26:50.093
She's not returning my phone calls.

26:50.127 --> 26:52.861
I'm sorry. She's not
returning mine, either.

26:52.896 --> 26:55.530
I feel awful about her taking
off on you guys like that.

26:55.565 --> 26:56.931
Well, it's not your fault.

26:56.966 --> 26:58.933
Well, I recommended
her. I feel responsible.

26:58.968 --> 27:03.405
See, the thing is, is I
really need to talk to Blanca.

27:03.439 --> 27:05.940
- Because of Katy.
- Katy?

27:05.975 --> 27:09.244
Well, she became very attached to Blanca,

27:09.278 --> 27:11.479
and I thought if they spoke on the phone,

27:11.513 --> 27:13.981
maybe Katy might feel better.

27:14.015 --> 27:16.584
I might be able to track her down.

27:16.618 --> 27:18.152
I started a healthcare plan

27:18.186 --> 27:20.488
for my employees, and Blanca joined.

27:20.522 --> 27:24.891
Maybe there's an emergency
contact in her paperwork.

27:24.926 --> 27:28.495
Ah. She has a sister in Arizona. Amelia.

27:28.529 --> 27:30.296

Why do you ask?

I don't know.

27:39.473 --> 27:41.641
She never got along with Blanca.

27:41.675 --> 27:44.177
I keep wondering if
there's more to the story.

27:45.811 --> 27:47.412
I'm afraid I'm in the dark on that one.

27:47.447 --> 27:50.582
Well, if you're looking for a new maid,

27:50.617 --> 27:52.083
I can drop by tomorrow with some ideas.

27:52.118 --> 27:54.453

lovely as your invitation is,

to stay here for Zoila.

and I had a dirty dream.

30:15.069 --> 30:17.737
Ah. And this dream was
not about your husband?

It was about <i>one</i> of my husbands.

30:21.242 --> 30:22.442
What?

30:22.477 --> 30:24.878
I dreamed about my husband who died.

Oh, he used to be late, but
he's not so late anymore.

for what we dream about.

31:36.078 --> 31:38.179
Blanca's missing.

31:39.181 --> 31:40.382
What?

31:40.416 --> 31:41.850
I called her sister in Arizona.

31:41.884 --> 31:43.252
She's not there.

31:43.286 --> 31:44.519
No one can get in touch with her.

31:44.554 --> 31:47.322
I'm sure there's an explanation.

31:49.592 --> 31:51.360
I also looked at her bank account.

31:52.861 --> 31:54.762
Why were you giving Blanca extra money?

31:57.633 --> 31:59.099
She wanted to go to college.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.601
[Clears throat]

32:00.636 --> 32:01.869
And she <i>was</i> doing such a good job...

32:01.903 --> 32:03.404
No.

32:03.438 --> 32:06.039
You said she was a bad fit.

32:06.074 --> 32:08.442
I think you were paying
her off to keep her quiet

32:08.477 --> 32:10.443
'cause she knew what
happened to Louie Becker.

32:10.478 --> 32:12.679
[Chuckles] Not that again.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.947
He was here that night, the
night that Blanca moved in.

32:16.450 --> 32:19.519
I told you I was not
having an affair with him.

32:19.553 --> 32:20.787
Oh, I know you weren't.

32:20.821 --> 32:23.423
So, why would he be here?

32:24.725 --> 32:26.125
Because I sent him.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.927
You remember the night
of Marisol's book party?

32:28.961 --> 32:30.296
And you get to miss

32:30.330 --> 32:32.030
all the difficult parts of child rearing.

32:32.064 --> 32:33.399
I can assure you, we're not missing

32:33.433 --> 32:35.133
<i>all</i> the difficult parts.

32:35.168 --> 32:38.036
No one ever said that being
a parent was easy, Michael.

32:38.070 --> 32:40.038
Excuse me.

32:45.243 --> 32:47.044
Good, you're here.

32:47.979 --> 32:49.880
I think tonight's the night.

32:51.082 --> 32:52.617
How do you know?

32:52.651 --> 32:54.385
I'm going out of town on the red-eye.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.720
Taylor can't wait for me to leave.

32:55.754 --> 32:57.154
And you think she'll call the lover?

32:57.189 --> 32:59.056
The minute I'm out the door.

32:59.090 --> 33:01.425
Now, are you sure she's having an affair?

33:01.459 --> 33:02.992
Hushed telephone calls, sneaking around?

33:03.027 --> 33:04.227
What else could it be, Louie?

33:04.261 --> 33:06.296
I'll find out.

33:06.331 --> 33:08.432
Get me pictures.

33:08.466 --> 33:10.600
I want to know who this bastard is.

33:10.635 --> 33:12.068
The key's in there, too.

33:12.102 --> 33:13.804
Get in, get out. Make sure no one sees you.

33:13.838 --> 33:15.839
I'll call you as soon as it's done.

33:18.342 --> 33:20.576
You sent that man to spy on me?

33:20.610 --> 33:22.911
And he turned up dead. Now
our maid is missing, too.

33:22.946 --> 33:24.447
You think I'm a murderer?

33:24.481 --> 33:26.181
No.

33:26.216 --> 33:28.851
But I think you know
what happened that night.

33:30.821 --> 33:32.254
Taylor...

33:33.724 --> 33:35.623
... just tell me the truth.

33:35.658 --> 33:37.124
Maybe I can help you.

33:37.159 --> 33:39.828
I don't trust you.

33:39.862 --> 33:42.330
You're in a world of trouble, Taylor.

33:42.365 --> 33:46.133
And whatever happened, it's gonna come out.

33:46.168 --> 33:48.536
I'm going to a hotel.

33:50.138 --> 33:51.805
Michael, wait!

33:51.840 --> 33:53.306
When are you coming home?

33:53.341 --> 33:55.709
I don't know.

33:57.545 --> 33:59.446
[Door closes]

34:03.885 --> 34:05.652
You're home late.

34:07.389 --> 34:10.656
I spent the afternoon
at the police station.

34:10.690 --> 34:13.993
I told them about the sex tape,
answered all their questions.

34:14.027 --> 34:15.728
You did?

34:15.763 --> 34:19.063
Well, it didn't make much
sense to keep it a secret

34:19.099 --> 34:20.400
now that everyone has seen it.

34:21.835 --> 34:24.370
Wait. How did <i>that</i> happen?

34:24.405 --> 34:26.471
You betrayed me. That's how.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.206
What are you talking about?

34:28.239 --> 34:30.708
You told Evelyn Powell about it!

34:30.743 --> 34:31.909
No, I didn't!

34:31.944 --> 34:33.177
I swear!

34:33.212 --> 34:34.978
Well, you must have told <i>someone!</i>

34:35.014 --> 34:36.415
No!

34:36.449 --> 34:39.384
I mean, I may have mentioned it to Carmen.

34:42.121 --> 34:46.156
I'm... so, so sorry.

34:46.190 --> 34:51.261
What happened to
maid-employer confidentiality?

34:51.295 --> 34:53.196
That's not a thing.

34:53.231 --> 34:58.235
But I told you I'm sorry,
and I really, really am.

34:58.269 --> 35:00.169
From the bottom of my heart.

35:00.203 --> 35:04.541
I trusted you, and you ruined my life!

35:04.575 --> 35:06.676
Now, hold on a second.

35:06.710 --> 35:08.411
All I do is help you!

35:08.446 --> 35:10.379
And this is what I get in return?

35:12.883 --> 35:14.283
All you do is help me?

35:14.318 --> 35:15.785
That's right.

35:15.820 --> 35:17.920
What about when you told me to lie to Javi?

35:17.954 --> 35:22.223
"Pretend it's his baby,
Zoila. He'll never find out."

35:22.258 --> 35:23.959
Is that what you mean by helping?

35:23.993 --> 35:25.594
That was good advice!

35:25.628 --> 35:27.095
Then why isn't Javi here now?

35:27.129 --> 35:29.030
Because you didn't listen!

35:29.065 --> 35:31.132
If you'd kept your mouth shut...

35:31.167 --> 35:33.201
If you'd kept your nose out of my business!

35:33.235 --> 35:35.269
Don't blame me for what happened!

35:35.303 --> 35:37.738
I'm not the one who was sleeping
with two men at the same time!

35:37.773 --> 35:40.708
No! You're too busy making a sex tape!

35:40.742 --> 35:43.778
- [Sighs]
- Wait!

35:43.812 --> 35:47.114
I can't bear to be in the
same house with you right now.

35:47.148 --> 35:49.550
Where are you going?

35:49.585 --> 35:52.285
Greece.

36:01.552 --> 36:03.286
Uh, Jesse?

36:04.555 --> 36:06.422
What's up? Why don't you take a break?

36:06.457 --> 36:08.191
Uh, I was hoping we could have that talk.

36:08.225 --> 36:10.694
Oh, sure.

36:10.728 --> 36:14.330
But my eyes are up here.

36:14.364 --> 36:16.132
Yes.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.933
About that conversation

36:17.968 --> 36:19.301
you heard my friend and
I having yesterday...

36:19.335 --> 36:21.536
No, I'm just playing.
Don't... Don't sweat it.

36:21.571 --> 36:24.640
Well, I need you to know that I value you.

36:25.742 --> 36:27.710
I don't ever want you to feel demeaned.

36:27.744 --> 36:32.114
Well, if anything, I'm flattered.

36:32.148 --> 36:37.384
That's nice of you to say,
but employer, employee.

36:37.419 --> 36:39.053
There's a good reason there's a line there.

36:39.088 --> 36:42.056
Look, look, I get it.
It's... it's cool, seriously.

36:42.091 --> 36:43.224
Thank you.

36:43.258 --> 36:44.892
[Chuckles] Such a relief.

36:44.927 --> 36:48.529
But for what it's worth...

36:48.563 --> 36:50.632
I think you're really hot, too.

36:58.138 --> 36:59.873
Where is Blanca?

36:59.907 --> 37:03.076
You said you paid her
off and she went home.

37:04.112 --> 37:06.713
No, she is not there!

37:06.748 --> 37:08.348
Did you do something to her?

37:08.382 --> 37:09.548
Do you swear?

37:09.582 --> 37:11.917
Mommy?

37:11.952 --> 37:13.919
Sweetheart... you should be in bed.

37:13.954 --> 37:15.154
What are you doing up?

37:15.188 --> 37:17.356
I heard yelling.

37:17.390 --> 37:19.825
[Sighs] Sorry. I didn't... 
I didn't mean to wake you.

37:19.860 --> 37:22.494
[Sniffles]

37:22.529 --> 37:24.163
Are you sad again?

37:25.898 --> 37:28.066
Uh, Katy, sweetie, I... I need to...

37:28.100 --> 37:31.036
I need to finish this call, and, uh,

37:31.070 --> 37:33.938
and then I'll tuck you
into bed again, okay?

37:33.973 --> 37:36.440
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:38.077 --> 37:39.243
Sorry. It's my daughter.

37:39.278 --> 37:41.680
No, because I don't believe you.

37:59.130 --> 38:01.197
Thank you for meeting me.

38:01.231 --> 38:03.299
I really wanted to talk to you in person.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.902
About that silly video?

38:05.936 --> 38:07.804
I don't really care about that.

38:07.838 --> 38:09.605
You don't?

38:09.639 --> 38:12.208
We all have pasts.

38:12.242 --> 38:14.276
I'm more interested in our future together.

38:14.311 --> 38:16.978
Oh, good.

38:17.013 --> 38:21.449
Because I was thinking I
<i>could</i> go to Greece with you

38:21.483 --> 38:23.451
if you'll still have me.

38:24.854 --> 38:26.955
Nothing would make me happier.

38:26.989 --> 38:28.556
[Sighs]

38:28.591 --> 38:30.258
But what about your maid?

38:32.661 --> 38:34.261
What about her?

38:41.136 --> 38:43.337
Mr. Powell?

38:43.371 --> 38:44.671
Do you have a minute?

38:44.706 --> 38:45.973
Ah, ah, ah.

38:46.007 --> 38:47.341
What have I said about politeness?

38:47.375 --> 38:50.244
Listen up, pig.

38:50.278 --> 38:52.178
Much better. Proceed.

38:53.881 --> 38:57.117
Look, you've been very generous with me,

38:57.151 --> 39:01.020
but this whole S&M thing... 
I don't want to do it anymore.

39:01.055 --> 39:02.521
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

39:02.556 --> 39:05.491
I was so looking forward
to playing with my new toy.

39:05.525 --> 39:07.160
What <i>is</i> that?

39:07.194 --> 39:09.694
Something to put a little extra...

39:09.729 --> 39:12.097
spark into our sessions.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.832
Oh, my God. That looks painful.

39:13.867 --> 39:15.667
It really does.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.469
What do you say we give it a try
tomorrow when Evelyn isn't home?

39:18.738 --> 39:21.506
I just told you... I'm done with all that.

39:23.342 --> 39:25.943
You're a woman with strong convictions.

39:25.978 --> 39:29.046
I bet Sebastien likes that about you.

39:29.081 --> 39:31.015
What?

39:31.049 --> 39:34.485
Sebastien, our realtor,
your married boyfriend.

39:35.553 --> 39:38.222
I put two and two together.

39:38.257 --> 39:41.659
Now, I assume neither of you
would want your tawdry affair

39:41.693 --> 39:43.059
to be public knowledge.

39:45.062 --> 39:47.497
You think you can threaten me?

39:47.531 --> 39:48.865
I'll tell Mrs. Powell

39:48.900 --> 39:50.333
what you've been up to behind her back.

39:50.367 --> 39:53.469
And if I know Evelyn,
she'll fire you on the spot.

39:53.504 --> 39:54.504
She'll fire him, too.

39:56.340 --> 39:59.708
You seem to be in a bit
of a bind, Mistress Luna.

40:01.678 --> 40:03.879
I feel bad for you. I really do.

40:05.015 --> 40:06.248
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:06.283 --> 40:10.352
And the safe word will be "blackmail."

40:18.360 --> 40:20.528
Are you ready for bed?

40:20.562 --> 40:23.898
Why are you wearing your best underwears?

40:23.933 --> 40:26.367
Did something happen to
your floppy, old pajamas?

40:26.401 --> 40:31.840
I thought we would, um,
switch things up a bit.

40:33.107 --> 40:34.374
Miguel's asleep.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.179
What? What's wrong?

40:39.214 --> 40:41.414
I don't feel so good.

40:41.449 --> 40:43.116
- Really?
- [Clears throat]

40:43.151 --> 40:47.221
It's like, um, a tickle in my throat.

40:47.255 --> 40:49.456
I... I must be coming down with something.

40:49.490 --> 40:50.756
I'll sleep on the couch.

40:50.790 --> 40:52.524
No, you don't have to do that.

40:52.559 --> 40:57.063
Trust me. It's, uh, safer this way.

40:57.097 --> 40:59.431
For everyone.

41:02.936 --> 41:05.604
[Doorbell rings]

41:07.006 --> 41:08.406
Oh, hi, Katy. Where's your mom?

41:08.440 --> 41:09.474
I came by to talk to her.

41:09.508 --> 41:12.143
- She won't wake up.
- What?

41:15.014 --> 41:16.381
Oh, my God.

41:16.415 --> 41:18.049
Oh, my God. Taylor?!

41:18.084 --> 41:19.217
Taylor?!

41:20.519 --> 41:21.719
Is she gonna be okay?

41:21.754 --> 41:23.921
I don't know, sweetheart.

41:23.955 --> 41:27.157
Um, I... I need an ambulance
at 5519 Canon Drive.

41:27.192 --> 41:28.425
Please hurry.

41:29.627 --> 41:30.895
Taylor?

41:30.929 --> 41:32.829
Taylor?

41:32.864 --> 41:35.065
Taylor!
