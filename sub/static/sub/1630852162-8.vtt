WEBVTT

00:12.887 --> 00:15.056
-Those are civil defense alarms!
-Settle down.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.766
Are we being attacked by robots?

00:16.850 --> 00:19.978
Sorry, I don't have any information now.
Let's not overtax your new heart.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.438
We're being attacked by robots.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.274
He beat up three of them,
but not before they broke into the dam,

00:24.357 --> 00:26.526
which turned off the shields,
which turned on the sirens.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.569
So what are we gonna do?

00:27.652 --> 00:30.196
"We"? No. Your condition is stable
as long as you stay in bed.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.323
It's fine.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.368
I mean it. If you overexert yourself,
you can suffer allograft rejection.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.288
I know. And then my heart will fail.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.582
-And then you'll die.
-So let's not do that.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.089
Yeah… Yeah.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.384
We both have mechanical hearts now.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.097
We're gonna make it through this.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.438
<i>Time to contact, 98 minutes.</i>

01:03.521 --> 01:05.148
We need that shield back up.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.859
Our teams are assessing
the situation at the dam.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.446
-They're drawing up recommendations.
-I was there. Here's my recommendation.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.156
Those turbines are toast.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.784
We don't have enough time
to get 'em repaired.

01:15.867 --> 01:16.701
Who are you?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.953
I'm an expert on things
that can't get repaired.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.956
-I don't think that came out right.
-What are we supposed to do?

01:22.040 --> 01:25.543
To start, we need 200 million watts
previously produced by the dam.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.838
-Those turbines are irreplaceable.
-Turbines are just things that spin.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.799
Anything that spins can generate energy.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.842
Like a Jupiter's takeoff
and landing engine.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.679
Yes, exactly!
We get a bunch of tiny spinning things

01:36.763 --> 01:39.641
to add up to the three
giant, irreplaceable ones.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.812
To pull this off, we need every Jupiter
on the colony to fly here immediately.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.231
-You'll plug them all into the city?
-Yes.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.857
The grid will overheat instantly.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.984
Not if you cool the cables
with liquid helium.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.903
Uh-- You have enough.
I've already checked.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.907
What if your plan doesn't work?
Will the Jupiters still be flightworthy?

01:57.075 --> 02:00.161
No. Once you jury-rig the engines,
the ships are grounded.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.830
There's no going back.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.252
So the alien robots, you still have
one of their engines, correct?

02:07.335 --> 02:11.297
Yes. We have one on the Jupiter 2.
Why do you ask?

02:11.381 --> 02:12.799
I can't gamble on this.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.094
As far as I can tell, that alien
technology is the only chance we have.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.638
There are other Alpha Centauris out there.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.808
Madam Chancellor,
these robots are relentless.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.977
Wherever we go, they will find us.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.729
We can't use their engine again.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.524
That's what got us
in this mess in the first place.

02:29.607 --> 02:33.486
To win, we need to use our own tools,
things that make us different from them.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.946
Our smarts,

02:35.029 --> 02:37.031
our resourcefulness,

02:37.115 --> 02:38.616
and our courage.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.743
That's how we beat them.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.509
Jupiter 17, tighten your approach!

02:56.593 --> 02:59.971
We're all gonna have to get cozy here,
so don't worry about your paint job!

03:00.847 --> 03:04.058
Don't wait for them to land!
Keep those cables running!

03:05.643 --> 03:07.854
Hey. I heard you need extra hands.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.105
Uh, yeah, sure.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.650
-You got enough slack?
-I'm good.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.444
All right.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.285
So, uh, John, uh…

03:23.161 --> 03:26.706
<i>All nonessential personnel,</i>
<i>please report to evacuation stations.</i>

03:26.789 --> 03:28.333
The kids will be leaving soon.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.418
Robinson, help out!

03:30.919 --> 03:32.003
Yeah, I'm coming.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.005
I'll be back.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.908
<i>The first convoy of children</i>
<i>and medical evacuees is leaving now.</i>

04:01.991 --> 04:03.493
Come on. Right this way.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.620
It's all clear.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.872
Are you looking for your evacuation group?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.791
I know exactly where I'm going.

04:14.379 --> 04:18.216
<i>Kendall Lambert</i>
<i>is cleared to travel with evac group 4.</i>

04:22.053 --> 04:24.222
Time to contact, 20 minutes.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.057
How close are we
to getting that shield up?

04:26.140 --> 04:29.477
It's tight, but at the rate the Jupiters
are being plugged in, we're on pace.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.395
Good.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.231
<i>Maureen, hey,</i>
<i>do you have a minute?</i>

04:33.856 --> 04:34.983
Not really.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.111
I-- I just wanna know our odds.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.948
Everyone's working hard to increase them.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.533
Goodbye, Smith.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.661
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Maureen,</i>
<i>you're the only person who can help me.</i>

04:48.579 --> 04:50.373
Are we gonna make it or not?

04:55.211 --> 04:59.674
When I was a little girl, I used to spend
nights looking up at the stars.

05:00.383 --> 05:04.679
I knew there was some other world
out there waiting for me.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.265
Getting there seemed impossible,

05:07.348 --> 05:08.474
but here I am.

05:09.934 --> 05:13.938
Our odds are worse than usual,
but we are going to make it,

05:14.689 --> 05:15.982
because we have to.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.943
Thanks, Maureen.
That's all I need to know.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.337
From your perspective,
this must seem pretty bad,

05:37.420 --> 05:41.049
but you have to understand the situation.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.509
If we're gonna believe Maureen Robinson,

05:45.636 --> 05:49.599
then the sun is gonna rise
on a quiet patch of land that's all mine.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.482
This is my only chance of getting that.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.697
Help Dr. Smith.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.074
Help who?

06:06.157 --> 06:08.701
And don't say family. I don't have one.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.829
So whoever you want me to help,
the answer is no.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.999
Help Dr. Smith.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.150
They'll be okay. Judy's with them.

06:56.999 --> 07:00.044
This is Judy Robinson.
Just checking on Will's status.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.339
His condition is unchanged.
Holding steady.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.812
Does anyone have any idea
where they're sending us?

07:17.895 --> 07:20.648
I heard we're headed to a copper mine.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.902
It's also where the first colonists buried
their MMRTGs when they got green energy.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.530
So they're hiding us
with the nuclear waste?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.575
Maybe it won't be so bad.
How nuclear is the waste?

07:31.784 --> 07:34.662
We shouldn't be evacuating.
We should be pitching in.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.207
I feel like the powers that be
don't recognize how excellent we are.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542
I agree.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.005
I mean, didn't we save all our parents?

07:44.839 --> 07:45.798
We did.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.842
And then we ran away from robots.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.094
We're good at running away.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.610
<i>The last wave of Jupiters</i>
<i>is landing now.</i>

08:05.693 --> 08:08.404
Great, Don.
Get them plugged in as fast as you can.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.208
-Ready!
-Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!

08:20.291 --> 08:24.086
No! You never, ever
plug the in into the out!

08:24.170 --> 08:26.255
You're gonna draw all the power
back to the Jupiter!

08:26.339 --> 08:28.466
You'll turn it into a giant bug zapper

08:28.549 --> 08:30.968
and then you're gonna
fry everyone touching it!

08:31.052 --> 08:32.345
What were you thinking?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.601
Well, good job, really.
Thank you. Proud of you.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.902
We've achieved minimum power.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.904
Activating shields.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.699
-EMF towers coming online now.
-Okay, that's a start.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.328
But we won't have total coverage
until every Jupiter is plugged in.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.501
Shield coverage at 65%.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.420
Incoming target
is maintaining course.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.090
They're not pulling up?

09:09.173 --> 09:11.676
They're accelerating.
3,000 kilometers per hour.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.346
4,000. 6,000. 9,000.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.390
They must have detected
our shield coming up.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.308
They're trying to squeeze through.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.435
Shield coverage at 85% and climbing.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.690
I'm plugging the last one in now.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.067
-Please tell me it's enough.
-<i>It's gonna be close.</i>

09:29.277 --> 09:31.028
Shield coverage at 90%.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.573
Recalculating time to contact.

09:35.032 --> 09:35.908
Ten seconds.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.619
Nine, eight,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.455
seven, six,

09:42.081 --> 09:43.040
five…

09:46.752 --> 09:48.212
…two, one.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.808
Shields are up. Did they make it through?

10:01.392 --> 10:03.561
Operations to convoy. What's your status?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.316
What is that sound?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.651
It means our radios are useless now

10:11.861 --> 10:13.321
because the robots are here.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.000
Will, are you okay?

10:26.083 --> 10:27.126
-Yeah.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.254
I need to go to see if anyone
needs help. There may be injuries.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.923
Stay inside the Chariot.
You'll be safe in here.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.111
Anyone see where our driver went?

10:57.406 --> 10:58.407
Isn't that him?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.662
-Why is everybody running?
-They're coming!

11:03.204 --> 11:06.332
-We need to get out of here.
-Agreed.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.460
-Come on.
-Come on. Come on!

11:30.356 --> 11:31.691
What's that new face mean?

11:38.155 --> 11:39.532
You want the engine.

11:39.615 --> 11:43.994
Of course you want the engine.
You always want the engine. But why now?

11:51.293 --> 11:54.964
It seems like we'd be on Alpha Centauri
in time for dinner if you switched it on.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.799
Danger.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.220
No meteor would be large enough
to create that kind of destruction.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.263
Agreed.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.515
Then what did?

12:07.017 --> 12:09.812
I killed them.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.486
Somebody! Somebody help, please!

12:18.028 --> 12:19.947
We need to keep the engine away from them!

12:21.073 --> 12:22.158
Stop, please!

12:33.961 --> 12:36.213
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>please reinsert IV.</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:40.217
<i>-Warning, status compromised.</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:43.804
<i>-Warning, risking critical heart failure.</i>

12:44.597 --> 12:48.100
<i>Please return to the bed.</i>
<i>Please return to the bed.</i>

12:48.976 --> 12:50.394
<i>Please return to the bed.</i>

12:54.064 --> 12:54.940
Will!

12:55.983 --> 12:58.110
Excuse me! Excuse me!

13:12.833 --> 13:16.837
Will? Will! Oh my God.
You shouldn't be out here.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.049
-It's the robot engines.
-I'm gonna get you out--

13:20.132 --> 13:21.342
They can use them as weapons.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.886
What are you talking about?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.889
Their engines rip holes in space.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.974
Know what it would do
if it was sitting on a planet?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.602
-I have no idea.
-You've already seen it.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.020
The planet we were stranded on,

13:33.103 --> 13:36.190
the one with all the meteors
and the giant missing piece.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.818
You mean the one where
the guys before us went extinct?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.445
You have to keep that engine
away from them.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.532
Okay, um, I'm gonna get Judy.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.450
No! There's no time.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.327
It's gotta be you.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.662
Will, I can't.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.704
Penny.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.500
Hey. Listen to me.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.420
I know you better than you know yourself.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.508
You're smart, brave,
and you're stronger than you think.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.344
You can do this.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.019
Okay.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.855
Okay, fine.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.233
Just you stay here…

14:20.943 --> 14:22.444
and don't get any worse.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.638
Just going out
for a little stroll.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.976
Just another day on Alpha Centauri.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.690
The sun is shining,
just like in the brochure,

14:59.773 --> 15:03.527
and definitely not surrounded by smoke.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.741
No burning spaceship wreckage.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.202
Definitely no robots.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.087
I have invested so much time
and energy in two years

15:22.171 --> 15:24.423
trying not to touch alien objects,

15:25.090 --> 15:26.175
yet here I am.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.146
-Penny?
-Oh, thank God you're here.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.773
I'm trying to help injured people,

15:40.856 --> 15:43.025
and I see you wandering
through a disaster area.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.654
We need to keep this far away from them.
The robots can use it as a bomb.

15:46.737 --> 15:50.199
Like, a big one.
I guess it can rip holes in space.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.867
Okay. Quit explaining. Let's do it.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.372
-Come on, grab the other side.
-Okay.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.375
-Okay…

16:04.838 --> 16:06.924
-Whoa!

16:07.007 --> 16:10.344
Don't worry. It's stuck under there.
Let's keep going.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.140
Penny!

16:18.018 --> 16:19.311
Penny, come on!

16:20.771 --> 16:23.065
-What are you doing?

16:32.199 --> 16:33.033
Penny!

16:35.119 --> 16:36.495
You're dying, aren't you?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.670
-Penny, come on!
-Okay, I'm coming.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.968
Penny, there's no time. Just leave it!

16:53.721 --> 16:56.473
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you,
so watch it with the claws.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.907
I'm Penny Robinson, by the way.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.287
Uh…

17:20.998 --> 17:22.750
And I don't want any trouble.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.172
So this is how the book ends.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.070
Penny!

17:51.153 --> 17:52.988
You said she was right behind you.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.531
Look.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.580
Hi, do you have a name?

18:01.663 --> 18:03.707
Robot-- Robot's already taken.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.835
Can I call you Sally?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.338
You look like a Sally.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.633
Penny?

18:13.550 --> 18:16.053
Penny. What did you do?

18:17.596 --> 18:18.764
I helped her.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.015
That's it?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.727
When I saw her struggling,
I thought about how when I need help,

18:23.811 --> 18:26.188
I have my family, and I have my friends,

18:27.523 --> 18:29.608
but she didn't have anybody.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.276
None of them do.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.919
Oh.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.548
Come on. We gotta help them too.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.697
I won't make this easy for you.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.057
I don't have the words for this.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.644
That's okay. That's my department.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.700
This changes everything.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.622
Help Will Robinson.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.381
Hey.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.259
I need to tell you something.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.553
What?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.598
I told you so.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.821
You've gotten better at it.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.827
Trouble, Penny Robinson.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.996
You're saying I'm trouble?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.289
Trouble.

20:50.874 --> 20:54.586
Oh, <i>in </i>trouble.
We're gonna work on prepositions.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.264
We need to keep this engine
away from them.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.312
But you already knew that.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.234
Be careful, Sally.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.413
Oh…

22:16.335 --> 22:18.170
Hey.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.802
Yeah, I know.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.265
It's bad, but… had a lot of work to do.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.517
Yes, Will Robinson.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.570
So, who's flying the ship?

22:49.951 --> 22:50.827
Buckle up.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.121
You sure about this?

22:53.205 --> 22:56.249
I'm perfectly capable
of piloting this Jupiter…

22:58.335 --> 23:00.962
assuming the flight manuals I read
were up-to-date.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.188
Jupiter 2 to Penny and Judy Robinson.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.066
We're coming to get you
and that engine out.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.567
We are?

23:24.986 --> 23:27.948
<i>We're on our way.</i>
<i>I just need you to send me your location.</i>

23:28.031 --> 23:30.867
Negative, Jupiter 2. Do not approach.
You'll be shot out of the sky.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.831
What's your status?

23:35.914 --> 23:39.042
We're cut off from the convoy,
but we're okay where we are.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.087
-Will, shouldn't you be in an ambulance?
-<i> I'm fine.</i>

23:42.754 --> 23:44.256
My heart's indestructible now.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.884
By the way, you gave me an idea.

23:49.719 --> 23:50.846
A big one.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.848
Do Mom and Dad know?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.892
Systems back online.

23:55.976 --> 23:59.688
Okay. Switch to the satellite view.
Show us the road out of town.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.648
Affirmative.
Getting it on the display.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.736
Are those robots…
on the ground?

24:08.155 --> 24:09.573
They're fighting each other.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.032
That's good news, right?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.994
<i>Jupiter 2 to operations.</i>
<i>This is Will Robinson.</i>

24:14.077 --> 24:15.454
-Will?
-Will?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.247
<i>Who's piloting the ship?</i>

24:17.330 --> 24:18.457
I am, Maureen.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.499
Smith?

24:19.583 --> 24:22.043
Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of this?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.086
-<i>Will…</i>
-Listen.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.254
<i>There's not much time.</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:26.798
Penny and Judy
have the engine from SAR's ship.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.093
It has to be kept from him,
no matter what.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.636
<i>It could destroy the planet.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:35.098
-Yeah. We can do that.
-No, you can't go off alone again!

24:35.182 --> 24:36.808
I'm not alone this time, Mom.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.899
I think I finally know
how to end this war.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.485
SAR was wrong…

24:48.820 --> 24:49.863
and so was I.

24:49.946 --> 24:53.325
<i>Robot and I aren't a fluke.</i>
<i>Penny just proved that.</i>

24:53.408 --> 24:55.410
Every robot can be free.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.330
Someone just has to make them see that.

24:59.748 --> 25:00.582
<i>Just…</i>

25:02.751 --> 25:04.920
Just hold on till Robot gets back.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.047
-Robot?
-What about you?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.719
Fingers crossed.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.762
-Will?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.388
-No!
-Will?

25:15.889 --> 25:19.100
John, his heart can't take the strain.

25:19.184 --> 25:23.438
Hey. He told us to hold on,
so that's what we're gonna do.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.233
But first things first.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.777
Let's get our kids out of there. Come on.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.992
So, where are we going?

25:56.930 --> 26:00.016
Okay. Okay. I think we're losing.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.227
I know.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.396
<i>Judy, Penny, if you can hear us,</i>

26:04.479 --> 26:06.481
<i>we're coming to get you and the engine</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

26:06.565 --> 26:08.316
<i>Meet us at the main road.</i>

26:08.400 --> 26:10.860
Our ride's here!
All right, keep your heads down.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.847
-Dad! Okay. Okay.
-Come on. Hurry!

26:38.930 --> 26:40.432
-Here you go.
-Quick!

26:40.515 --> 26:42.142
-Let's go.
-Okay. I'm in.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.269
-You okay?
-Come on. Let's go.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.194
We're gonna need to find someplace
to put that thing.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.071
Somewhere the robots can't get to it.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.244
So, when we were plugging all the Jupiters
into the city grid,

27:01.328 --> 27:05.415
you know that one thing that
you're never, ever, ever supposed to do?

27:05.498 --> 27:07.292
You mean plugging the in in the out?

27:08.668 --> 27:09.669
We're doing it.

27:12.964 --> 27:13.798
Yeah.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.125
You really should be lying down.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.418
Same difference.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.050
What is this place?

27:58.551 --> 27:59.594
Home.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.889
Is anyone else worried
there might be a lot of robots here?

28:02.972 --> 28:04.140
There better be.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.271
You're one of them.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.775
They'll listen to you.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.662
I knew you wouldn't come here without me.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.753
But now you have to finish this.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.549
Tell them everything.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.989
Since that engine is shut off,
the robots can't sense it,

29:01.072 --> 29:03.116
so they're searching Jupiter to Jupiter.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.243
The J65. That's us.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.079
That's Don.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.416
And that's them.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.210
<i>Maureen, we're in.</i>
<i>Sealing the door now.</i>

29:20.049 --> 29:21.384
You have trouble finding it?

29:21.468 --> 29:23.678
It was in the scrapyard
scheduled for recycling.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.223
Yeah, the powers that be had it towed
because it wasn't street-legal anymore.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.434
Still got a few miles left in it.
I can relate.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.686
-Let's hope we don't need it.
-<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

29:32.270 --> 29:36.733
I'm at the substation.
I hope you guys are nice and snug inside.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.735
<i>We're good, Don. We're ready.</i>

29:39.319 --> 29:41.654
Okay, in into the out.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.490
At the count of one.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.328
Hey, Don, we're not electrified yet.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.413
<i>-What's happening?</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:52.999
Slight hiccup.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.335
Is that a hiccup you can fix?

29:57.670 --> 30:00.465
No problem.
I just have to resolder the capacitor.

30:03.968 --> 30:04.969
Where is it?

30:05.804 --> 30:06.805
Oh!

30:07.388 --> 30:08.556
Oh, no, no, no, no!

30:09.849 --> 30:12.185
No! Why would anyone put a grate here?

30:12.769 --> 30:14.187
Gah!

30:23.988 --> 30:25.073
They're getting close.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.867
Come on, Don.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.620
You're not gonna let your family die
'cause you can't connect a wire.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.040
Uh, they're all over the Jupiter
right next to us.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.877
Don, if you have any tricks
up your sleeve, now is the time.

30:39.045 --> 30:39.921
Oh!

30:42.465 --> 30:45.426
Mmm! Oh, once a roughneck,
always a roughneck!

31:01.526 --> 31:03.069
-Now!

31:13.121 --> 31:15.540
<i>Thanks, Don!</i>
<i>We're good, for now.</i>

31:18.793 --> 31:20.378
Oh, great.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.923
They're not gonna just give up
because their buddies got zapped.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.425
Don, you did what you could.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.635
<i>Now try and find some cover. Stay safe.</i>

31:27.719 --> 31:29.053
See you on the other side.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.222
Okay, let's settle in.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.892
The electrical field will hold

31:33.975 --> 31:35.977
until the fuel
powering the Jupiters runs out.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.312
How long will that be?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.272
Till Will gets back.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.868
Will… stay awake.

31:55.955 --> 32:00.376
We're here,
but they don't seem too happy to see him.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.216
The robot's drawing pictures.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.101
It's the story of the two of you.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.188
How you met.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.398
How you changed him.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.582
Will, he's drawing something new.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.419
I think it's a picture of your sister
doing what you did.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.463
Bonding with the robot.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.099
They're not listening.

32:57.809 --> 32:58.768
They're leaving.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.512
Is there anything you can do?

34:29.192 --> 34:31.652
Trust, Will Robinson.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.202
No.

35:25.915 --> 35:26.833
No.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.001
No.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.465
No.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.481
What did you do?

36:01.117 --> 36:04.162
Why did he do that?
He shouldn't have done that!

36:04.662 --> 36:05.538
You know why.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.795
Let's get you back to the ship.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.176
I can still feel him.

36:19.886 --> 36:20.928
He's gone.

36:22.013 --> 36:22.930
I'm sorry.

36:23.931 --> 36:24.849
Let's go.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.577
The last thing he said to me…

36:46.078 --> 36:47.121
was "trust."

36:48.789 --> 36:52.251
Maybe he was trusting us
to go on… without him.

36:56.881 --> 37:01.135
According to this, I'm…
I'm completely healed.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.392
That's a piece of Robot.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.980
I think he put that there
when he put his hand on your heart.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.108
He saved me.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.527
He saved me too.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.529
How?

37:21.113 --> 37:22.365
Back in the med facility,

37:22.448 --> 37:26.244
I was about to do something
you can't… ever come back from.

37:27.203 --> 37:31.290
I didn't think I had a choice,
but the robot gave me one.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.710
I thought he was asking for help,

37:35.503 --> 37:37.380
but he was there to help <i>me.</i>

37:38.506 --> 37:40.675
He knew what I needed.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.552
He's always seemed to know
what we both needed.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.197
Is that sound coming from them?

38:04.907 --> 38:06.784
-It's a command.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.412
To do what?

38:25.553 --> 38:28.014
<i>Primary fuel reservoir depleted.</i>

38:28.097 --> 38:30.182
<i>Switching to reserve fuel supply.</i>

38:30.266 --> 38:33.060
<i>Reserve fuel level at 10%.</i>

38:37.606 --> 38:40.526
<i>Reserve fuel level at 9%.</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:47.575
I heard that, among your various skills
of soldiering and growing corn,

38:47.658 --> 38:51.454
that you worked on
second-grade research projects.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.498
Judy tell you that?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.752
Everyone thought I was gone,
but you kept me alive for her.

38:59.211 --> 39:02.590
-A lot of guys wouldn't have done that.
-You were a fallen hero.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.509
The most decorated astronaut in history.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.181
Sitting at the kitchen table

39:10.723 --> 39:14.060
writing your résumé
on a big piece of cardboard

39:14.977 --> 39:17.646
with markers
that smelled like strawberries.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.441
First man to Mars.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.863
First man to… leave the solar system.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.288
First in a lot of things.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.874
I had some big shoes to fill.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.378
Markers that smelled
like strawberries, huh?

39:41.128 --> 39:42.421
Sounds nice.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.464
It was.

39:44.965 --> 39:48.219
All those firsts don't seem like much
compared to what I missed.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.763
Took me a while to figure that out too.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.058
<i>Reserve fuel level critical.</i>

39:54.141 --> 39:55.351
We're out of fuel.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.369
Go!

40:20.709 --> 40:22.586
Come on, hurry. Kids, get in.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.381
-You know the plan?
-Yeah, we're ready.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.551
Take care of our kids.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.637
Be careful!

40:46.777 --> 40:48.404
-You drive!

41:10.384 --> 41:11.677
Hey. Uh…

41:12.219 --> 41:15.556
I saw there's, uh,
an Italian restaurant near the park.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.101
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.021
You think they make decent gnocchi?

41:25.357 --> 41:28.194
How about when this is all over,
we could find out?

41:29.111 --> 41:30.112
Just you and me.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.407
I would love that.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.030
John.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.450
John!

42:22.957 --> 42:23.832
Oh!

42:32.841 --> 42:35.970
Someday, I'm gonna see you up close.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.276
It looks different
from up here, doesn't it?

42:51.652 --> 42:52.653
Yeah.

42:58.826 --> 43:03.038
When I was your age,
I used to dream about being up here.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.500
But it's even better than I imagined.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.545
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

43:11.171 --> 43:15.676
'Cause it's with you
and your sisters and your dad.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.605
Ow.

43:52.129 --> 43:52.963
Hey!

43:55.299 --> 43:56.842
You know Will Robinson?

43:57.843 --> 43:59.053
I'm his mother.

44:11.649 --> 44:12.900
You're next.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.171
It's from Will.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.678
-I know those engines.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.579
Will Robinson.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.084
You need to turn it off.

45:55.961 --> 45:56.962
No.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.507
Turn it off now!

46:00.591 --> 46:02.301
Kill masters.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.178
Kill heart.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.892
He's gonna take us down with him.

46:17.524 --> 46:18.859
Will!

46:21.278 --> 46:22.654
Will, no!

46:25.282 --> 46:28.118
Trust, Will Robinson.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.833
He knew you'd go for my heart again.

46:44.426 --> 46:45.677
And I trust him.

46:54.770 --> 46:55.813
I'm okay.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.039
Robot?

47:15.749 --> 47:17.125
Robot, is that you?

47:37.938 --> 47:39.940
Safe, family.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.844
So less than 24 hours
after the Robinsons get here,

48:08.927 --> 48:10.846
Alpha Centauri is trashed.

48:11.763 --> 48:14.933
I'm not saying there's a connection,
but it doesn't look good.

48:16.602 --> 48:22.566
I… see it as an opportunity
to build it better a second time.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.945
That's gonna be one hell of a to-do list.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.707
I could use a hug about now.

48:38.790 --> 48:40.584
-Anyone?

48:46.131 --> 48:48.258
<i>I guess it's my job</i>
<i>to write the epilogue.</i>

48:49.051 --> 48:51.553
<i>That's fine. As jobs go, it's pretty easy.</i>

48:51.637 --> 48:54.765
<i>I just sit in a chair</i>
<i>and scribble on a piece of paper</i>

48:54.848 --> 48:56.892
<i>while Mom's in orbit</i>

48:56.975 --> 48:59.478
<i>building another spaceship</i>
<i>to replace the Resolute.</i>

49:00.604 --> 49:05.150
<i>She's assisted by super-advanced beings</i>
<i>whose technology still seems like magic.</i>

49:05.233 --> 49:06.151
Well…

49:09.071 --> 49:10.238
<i>And also Don.</i>

49:10.322 --> 49:12.157
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if--
-Right there.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.701
Yes, I know. But if we move stuff…

49:14.785 --> 49:16.620
Just take this. Here you go. Heads up.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.752
<i>Once the robots were freed</i>
<i>from their old programming,</i>

49:23.835 --> 49:25.754
<i>they could do whatever they wanted.</i>

49:25.837 --> 49:29.174
<i>Most left and didn't feel the need</i>
<i>to tell us where they were going.</i>

49:29.257 --> 49:33.220
<i>Now they're writing their own commands,</i>
<i>they're all different. Just like we are.</i>

49:37.140 --> 49:41.728
<i>For her part, once she was reassembled,</i>
<i>again, Sally left almost immediately.</i>

49:42.813 --> 49:46.692
<i>I was disappointed at first,</i>
<i>then I realized she's just a girl</i>

49:46.775 --> 49:49.361
<i>who's not afraid</i>
<i>to go find her place in the universe.</i>

49:50.278 --> 49:52.072
<i>I like to think she got that from me.</i>

49:55.158 --> 49:57.202
<i>I've never seen Dad this relaxed.</i>

49:59.037 --> 50:03.125
<i>They say that, more than anyone else,</i>
<i>soldiers appreciate the value of peace.</i>

50:06.920 --> 50:08.046
<i>Judy hasn't slowed down,</i>

50:08.130 --> 50:11.758
<i>but I think she finally realized</i>
<i>that she has nothing to prove to anyone.</i>

50:13.719 --> 50:18.348
<i>I haven't seen Dr. Smith for a while,</i>
<i>which makes me nervous.</i>

50:28.859 --> 50:30.235
You're looking better.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.738
You may have got rid of the evidence,

50:32.821 --> 50:35.991
but I still know what you did
and who you really are.

50:42.748 --> 50:45.208
You think I'll fall for
the same trick twice?

50:45.292 --> 50:46.585
It's not a trick.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.463
It's a confession.

50:55.260 --> 50:57.721
Prisoner 002, you have a visitor.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.348
Hmm.

51:04.102 --> 51:06.521
Did you bake me a cake with a file in it?

51:07.105 --> 51:08.190
I don't bake.

51:09.649 --> 51:11.401
And you don't need a file.

51:13.570 --> 51:17.866
When I was reviewing the passenger list
for Solidarity's maiden voyage from Earth,

51:17.949 --> 51:22.037
I came across the name… Jessica Harris,

51:22.621 --> 51:24.873
authorized by Dr. Zoe Smith.

51:26.124 --> 51:27.167
Who is she?

51:27.250 --> 51:28.418
My sister…

51:30.170 --> 51:31.213
technically.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.091
She's disowned me.

51:36.551 --> 51:38.804
Then she doesn't know who you really are.

51:39.387 --> 51:41.681
I'm not sure I know
who I am at this point.

51:43.308 --> 51:44.226
I do.

51:46.436 --> 51:47.813
When you get out of here,

51:48.730 --> 51:50.023
look me up.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.867
Mom! Come on!
Dinner's gonna get cold!

52:09.292 --> 52:10.710
<i>We'll see how it turned out.</i>

52:10.794 --> 52:13.922
The recipe didn't account for hybrid corn,
so I had to improvise.

52:14.005 --> 52:14.840
Of course you did.

52:14.923 --> 52:17.634
Sorry we're late.
Debbie got into a fight with a goat.

52:19.219 --> 52:20.262
Wow!

52:20.929 --> 52:24.432
Everything smells amazing! That's
the first time I've said that in a while.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.561
Yeah. Civilization is nice, right?

52:27.644 --> 52:30.272
We're not even planning
to leave this galaxy.

52:30.355 --> 52:33.024
-Did you okay this?
-It's the first I've heard of it.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.903
I've already logged
over a hundred hours of flight time, and…

52:38.113 --> 52:39.781
and this time I won't be alone.

52:40.740 --> 52:43.076
Trust Will Robinson.

52:49.040 --> 52:52.043
Okay, just be home by Christmas.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.837
We will be. Don't worry.

52:54.963 --> 52:56.381
-I promise!

52:56.464 --> 52:58.508
Guys, I promise.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.843
Okay.

53:01.595 --> 53:03.722
All right. I'm starving.

53:03.805 --> 53:05.140
Don't you wanna say grace?

53:05.974 --> 53:07.767
-Can we start?
-Yeah.

53:13.106 --> 53:14.024
Thank you.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.400
Pass it down.

53:15.483 --> 53:16.943
Oh yeah. Is this for me?

53:17.027 --> 53:18.278
It's easier to do it that way.

53:21.907 --> 53:24.242
Hey! Slow down! Slow down!

53:30.123 --> 53:33.960
<i>Will said, "Don't worry.</i>
<i>I promise I'll be home for Christmas."</i>

53:34.044 --> 53:37.964
But we all know things don't always
work out the way we plan.

53:41.843 --> 53:43.303
The end.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.150
Of chapter one.

54:03.531 --> 54:08.370
This is Will Robinson of the first
Human-Robot Exploratory Group.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.958
I don't know exactly
where we are right now…

54:15.794 --> 54:17.003
but it's beautiful.
