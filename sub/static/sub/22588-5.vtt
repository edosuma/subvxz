You know, I got to hand it

01:20.887 --> 01:23.548
He's done a remarkable
job with The Joker.

01:23.550 --> 01:27.774
Yes, he's brought modern
penology a long way, chief.

01:27.776 --> 01:31.202
I never thought I'd see
the day when the likes of him

01:31.204 --> 01:33.099
would be content
to play baseball

01:33.101 --> 01:35.827

a prison-break.

I'm afraid you're
going to have

04:02.350 --> 04:04.644
to practice

04:08.706 --> 04:09.636
Gee whiz, Aunt Harriet

04:09.638 --> 04:11.832
what's so important
about Chopin?

04:11.834 --> 04:14.361
All music is important, Dick.

04:14.363 --> 04:15.692
It's the universal language.

You're right.

harder from now on.

Your-your snack, Master Dick.

Holy cofax, you mean..

04:45.578 --> 04:49.801
I mean, I didn't know
it was getting so late, Bruce.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.462
Ball game, indeed.

04:53.464 --> 04:56.757
I don't know what I'm going
to do with that boy, Alfred.

04:56.759 --> 04:59.451
He just doesn't seem
to have any appreciation

04:59.453 --> 05:02.314

05:02.316 --> 05:04.278
No need, madam.

05:08.373 --> 05:11.831
- Not him again.
- How soon can you get here?

07:29.635 --> 07:32.129
Propelled him out
before the astonished guards

07:32.131 --> 07:34.358
could get a shot at him.

07:35.958 --> 07:40.948
Ingenious. Only The Joker
would think of that.

07:40.950 --> 07:43.543
You searched
the area outside?

07:43.545 --> 07:44.341
Sure thing, we did

07:44.343 --> 07:46.905
and found nothing
but the net he landed in.

07:46.907 --> 07:51.529
But inside at the base of that
spring they discovered this.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.222
A good likeness.

07:56.224 --> 07:58.218
A good likeness
but a bad joke.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.550
Laughing at us
for letting him get away.

07:59.552 --> 08:02.611
'It might be more
than a joke, Chief O'Hara.'

08:02.613 --> 08:06.205
Batman's right.
It could be a clue.

08:06.207 --> 08:06.871
A clue?

08:06.873 --> 08:08.601
Sure. The crime wave
he's plotting.

08:08.603 --> 08:12.028
But why would he
leave you a clue, Batman?

08:12.030 --> 08:12.961
He might not mean to.

08:12.963 --> 08:16.155
It's a trait of the
criminal mind the urge to boast.

08:16.157 --> 08:20.348
It often leads to the criminals
giving himself away.

08:21.081 --> 08:24.940
A bust mounted on a pedestal.

08:24.942 --> 08:27.036
'A bust.'

08:27.038 --> 08:28.101
'A pedestal.'

08:28.103 --> 08:32.592
Where does one usually find
a bust mounted on a pedestal?

08:32.595 --> 08:36.121
- In a museum.
- Right. Or in a hall of fame.

08:36.123 --> 08:37.650
- Or in both!
- Exactly.

08:37.653 --> 08:41.578
A perfect set up for
one of The Joker's jolly crimes.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.775
I don't understand, Batman.

08:43.777 --> 08:47.535
This very day
the Gotham Museum of Modern Art

08:47.537 --> 08:48.932
opened a new exhibit.

08:48.934 --> 08:49.898
A comedians Hall of Fame.

08:49.900 --> 08:54.556
I read in the paper, they were
not going to include The Joker.

08:54.558 --> 08:57.884
Just the thing
to make him want to get even.

08:57.886 --> 08:58.883
Of course.

08:58.885 --> 09:03.109
The museum also houses
a fabulous jewel collection.

09:03.111 --> 09:06.037
Oh, chief, why didn't
we think of that?

09:06.039 --> 09:07.900
Me hats off to you, Batman.

09:07.902 --> 09:10.529
Save the compliments,
Chief O'Hara.

09:10.531 --> 09:11.562
Our job has just begun.

09:11.564 --> 09:15.954
Come on, Robin. We've got
a date at the Gotham Museum.

09:44.309 --> 09:48.599
Oh, there he is.
It's Robin, the Boy Wonder!

09:50.564 --> 09:52.526
Oh, my God!

09:56.787 --> 10:01.012
That's okay,
Batman. Don't worry.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.808
Thanks, officer.

10:07.869 --> 10:09.863
Police emergency,
clear the museum.

10:09.865 --> 10:13.724
We think there may be
a daring crime plotted.

10:13.726 --> 10:15.953
Yes. Yes, of course.

10:25.505 --> 10:27.467
Strange. Look.

10:27.603 --> 10:28.599
'The Joker.'

10:28.601 --> 10:32.459
He's included in the Comedians
Hall of Fame after all.

10:32.461 --> 10:34.455
Maybe the paper
made a mistake.

10:34.457 --> 10:35.454
Or else..

10:36.787 --> 10:39.447
'Attention ladies
and gentlemen..'

10:39.449 --> 10:42.210
...the museum is
now closing for the day.

10:42.212 --> 10:45.205
We will reopen tomorrow
at ten o'clock.

10:45.207 --> 10:47.600
'Move promptly
to the exits, please.'

10:47.602 --> 10:49.930
You were saying,
Batman, "Or else.."

10:49.932 --> 10:51.260
I don't know.

10:52.262 --> 10:56.487
Museum officials could've heard
about The Joker's prison-break

10:56.489 --> 10:57.585
and hastily included him.

10:57.587 --> 11:00.580
Sure. So as not to enrage him
into stealing the jewels.

11:00.582 --> 11:03.941
Or else, this whole thing
could be a trick

11:03.943 --> 11:06.502
to divert us
from his real intentions.

11:06.504 --> 11:07.700
Holy red herring!

11:07.702 --> 11:09.097
How will we find out?

11:09.599 --> 11:13.092
Let's look up
the director of the museum.

11:15.589 --> 11:18.582
What's the matter, Batman?

11:18.584 --> 11:22.276
No, it's nothing, for a second
there I could've sworn

11:22.278 --> 11:25.204
I saw that statue move.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.003
Sure looks lifelike.

11:26.005 --> 11:28.266
It's almost as if
I could hear that

11:28.268 --> 11:31.129
hateful Harley Quinn laughing.

11:31.131 --> 11:34.223
Come on,
let's find the director.

11:34.458 --> 11:37.019
Quick, where do
we find the director?

11:37.021 --> 11:38.150
The administrative annex.

11:38.152 --> 11:39.282
Entrance next door, Batman.

11:39.284 --> 11:42.542
Thanks. Sorry about
the early closing.

11:49.932 --> 11:52.093
Lock it up good.
The Joker's on the loose.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.589
Don't worry about him getting
in here, Batman. No, sir.

11:54.591 --> 11:57.983
Once I get these doors locked,
the museum is burglarproof.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.912
No one could break into it.

11:59.914 --> 12:01.843
Come on, Robin.

12:01.845 --> 12:04.106
Ready to lock up, Mr. Hovis.

12:04.108 --> 12:05.769
Coming.

12:14.756 --> 12:17.749
Come, my comic cohorts in crime.

12:19.715 --> 12:21.543
Come, Oliver.

12:25.937 --> 12:28.365
Come, Stanley.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.355
Come, Ernie.

12:39.415 --> 12:42.042
W.C. Fields, come.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.493
Come, my puckish
partners in plunder.

12:51.495 --> 12:52.457
Batman has been outwitted

12:52.459 --> 12:56.617
and the fabulous jewel
collection is ours.

13:12.326 --> 13:14.886
Strange. No answer. I wonder.

13:15.721 --> 13:17.016
What is it, Batman?

13:17.018 --> 13:19.246
Something that guard said.

13:19.248 --> 13:21.941
All he said was that
the museum was burglarproof.

13:21.943 --> 13:24.537
Yes, but then he
added something else.

13:24.539 --> 13:28.297
He said, no one
could break into it..

13:28.299 --> 13:29.461
Holy stuffing!

13:29.463 --> 13:30.593
Exactly, Robin.

13:30.595 --> 13:33.821
That doesn't mean
that someone couldn't..

13:33.823 --> 13:35.884
Break out!

13:37.317 --> 13:40.975
- Guard! Guard!
- Smash the lock.

13:47.134 --> 13:49.362
Oh, how delicious it is.

13:49.364 --> 13:50.826
The Joker outwits Batman

13:50.828 --> 13:53.788
and steals
the fabulous jewel collection

13:53.790 --> 13:56.549
right out from
under his nose.

13:57.849 --> 14:00.510
Oh, my playful pilfering pals.

14:00.512 --> 14:01.508
How delicious it is.

14:01.510 --> 14:03.871
We hate to sound
a sour note, Joker.

14:03.873 --> 14:06.898
But it's time for us
to make our own collection.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.161
Destroy them!

14:33.123 --> 14:35.949
<i> Watch out, Batman.</i>

14:35.951 --> 14:37.613
Batman!

14:43.373 --> 14:46.299
We have two more jewels
for our collection.

14:46.301 --> 14:47.130
My comic cronies.

14:47.132 --> 14:53.055
Batman and Robin, the dashing
diamonds of derring-do.

14:54.687 --> 14:55.849
Come, my funny fellows.

14:56.051 --> 15:00.475
We've got a little
diamond cutting to do.

15:03.972 --> 15:06.998
<i> Is Batman to become</i>
<i> just another jewel</i>

15:07.000 --> 15:09.993
<i> in the Clown Prince's crown?</i>

15:34.154 --> 15:37.081
Here's a joke on you, you fiend.

15:40.144 --> 15:40.874
It's the gasser.

15:40.876 --> 15:43.769
This is the end
of your evil career.

15:43.771 --> 15:46.432
That cursed utility belt again.

15:48.896 --> 15:50.924
I swear by all that's funny

15:50.926 --> 15:53.919
I shall never be
fooled by that insidious

15:53.921 --> 15:57.813
unconstitutional device again.

16:00.411 --> 16:03.969
Two heads
for the price of one.

16:07.930 --> 16:13.719
<i> Could this be a threat?</i>
<i> Will The Joker keep his vow?</i>

16:13.721 --> 16:15.150
<i> Can he?</i>

16:15.152 --> 16:16.880
<i> How?</i>

16:22.107 --> 16:26.065
<i> Gotham Pier Amusement Park.</i>

16:28.163 --> 16:32.654
<i> What more appropriate place to</i>
<i> find the hideout of The Joker?</i>

16:32.656 --> 16:36.182
Never again will Batman
have the advantage over me

16:36.184 --> 16:38.211
with that utility belt of his.

16:38.213 --> 16:43.003
No, never again will that
ghastly girdle thwart my plans.

16:43.005 --> 16:46.165
For I,
the Clown Prince of Crime

16:46.167 --> 16:47.330
have found the answer to it.

16:47.332 --> 16:50.889
- What is it, Joker?
- My own utility belt.

16:50.891 --> 16:52.020
Gee, terrific.

16:52.022 --> 16:55.149
- Can I try it--
- Hands off, you fool.

16:55.151 --> 16:56.845
It is for me, only.

16:56.847 --> 16:59.208
Me, your merry master.

16:59.776 --> 17:03.368
It's secrets are
my precious property.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.330
What does it do, Joker?

17:05.333 --> 17:06.795
Everything.

17:06.797 --> 17:08.392
It's my Aladdin's lamp.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.122
Gee, can I make
a wish on it?

17:11.124 --> 17:12.452
Do, my pretty!

17:12.454 --> 17:15.380
Gee, I'd like
a million bucks.

17:15.382 --> 17:19.473
- A sable wrap--
- Oh, common place.

17:19.476 --> 17:22.169
A two-week ocean cruise?

17:22.171 --> 17:23.733
Extraordinary.

17:23.736 --> 17:24.897
What, Joker?

17:24.900 --> 17:25.431
Just the thing.

17:25.433 --> 17:28.792
The most astonishing coup
anyone ever pulled.

17:28.794 --> 17:32.153
Queenie, quick,
get me that newspaper.

17:32.155 --> 17:34.349
Here you are, Joker.

17:35.216 --> 17:36.745
S.S. Gotham.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.242
The new super luxury liner

17:38.244 --> 17:41.005
going to be launched
this Saturday. Yes!

17:41.007 --> 17:44.699
Gosh, you think you could use
your utility belt to, uh

17:44.701 --> 17:46.995
get me a cruise
on the S.S. Gotham.

17:46.997 --> 17:50.755
A cruise?
Mere petty pilfering.

17:50.757 --> 17:52.785
I'll get you the whole ship!

17:52.787 --> 17:55.214
- What?
- The whole ship?

17:55.216 --> 17:59.274
- How, Joker?
- Ah! First steps first.

17:59.276 --> 18:01.238
Our old nemesis Batman.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.332
- 'He'll try to stop us.'
- Exactly. Exactly.

18:04.334 --> 18:08.659
We must first eliminate
Batman from the scene.

18:18.312 --> 18:20.273
Since you're
the majority stockholder in

18:20.275 --> 18:23.202
Gotham shipping lines,
Bruce, I hope you'd be pleased

18:23.204 --> 18:26.297
to hear that I've arranged
for Batman and the Boy Wonder

18:26.299 --> 18:30.256
to christen the S.S. Gotham
when she's launched on Saturday.

18:37.247 --> 18:40.174
What is it, commissioner?
What does it mean?

18:40.176 --> 18:42.104
It looks like
a clown doll to me.

18:42.106 --> 18:45.099
'It's that chap
on the chicanery again.'

18:45.101 --> 18:46.097
'The Joker.'

18:46.099 --> 18:49.325
Could he be subconsciously
pointing toward his next crime?

18:49.327 --> 18:50.690
Maybe he's gonna
rob the circus.

18:50.692 --> 18:54.317
Oh, no, no, no.
The circus left town last week.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.032
'Batman should know
about this immediately.'

19:23.936 --> 19:27.262
I'm sorry, commissioner,
but Batman is out for the day.

19:27.264 --> 19:32.053
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll leave
word that you called.

19:39.809 --> 19:41.072
He's not there.

19:41.074 --> 19:43.601
What are we to do now,
commissioner?

19:43.603 --> 19:44.865
I don't know.
I just don't know.

19:44.867 --> 19:48.758
Well, don't worry. I'm sure the
police department can handle it.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.620
Dick and I are already late
for that Chopin concert.

19:51.622 --> 19:54.648
If you need anything,
please let us know.

19:54.650 --> 19:55.813
Yes, I'll do that, Bruce.

19:55.815 --> 19:59.141
Oh, by the way,
it may sound strange but..

19:59.143 --> 20:02.735
...I wonder if I could keep
that doll for a souvenir.

20:02.737 --> 20:05.597
- Any use for it, O'Hara?
- Hmm, not for me.

20:05.599 --> 20:08.159
The sooner we get
this out of headquarters

20:08.161 --> 20:09.490
the better I like it.

20:09.492 --> 20:10.522
With our compliments, Bruce.

20:10.524 --> 20:14.881
A souvenir of your
narrow brush with crime.

20:14.883 --> 20:17.111
Thank you, commissioner.

20:19.775 --> 20:21.737
We're already
late for the concert

20:21.739 --> 20:24.132
but if you need us
for anything just let us know.

20:24.134 --> 20:28.491
Huh? A fat lot of help he'd be
against someone like The Joker.

20:28.493 --> 20:31.054
Oh, he's a good man Bruce Wayne.

20:31.056 --> 20:36.545
But not even all his money
could buy us another Batman.

20:41.872 --> 20:46.827
Gosh! Nothing but perfectly
ordinary dust patterns.

20:47.661 --> 20:48.891
I'm disappointed alright.

20:48.893 --> 20:52.751
I'd hope for some clue to the
location of his secret hideout.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.948
Think it's worth
checking for secret writing?

20:54.950 --> 20:56.379
No, I hardly think so.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.641
That's not
The Joker's way of working.

20:58.643 --> 21:01.702
Why did The Joker throw
the doll through the window?

21:01.704 --> 21:04.531
What was the point of it?

21:05.897 --> 21:08.658
- I think I've got it.
- You have, Batman?

21:08.660 --> 21:13.583
What other kind of clown is
there besides a circus clown?

21:13.585 --> 21:17.344
I'll give you a hint, tonight,
there's gonna be a live telecast

21:17.346 --> 21:20.072
of the Gotham City
opera company.

21:20.473 --> 21:21.835
Golly, Batman,
I still don't get it.

21:21.837 --> 21:27.393
They're performing a certain
celebrated Italian opera.

21:28.493 --> 21:29.589
Holy ravioli!

21:29.591 --> 21:30.388
Your warm.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.551
Pagliacci!

22:03.867 --> 22:06.527
That's beautiful.

22:06.529 --> 22:07.891
I-I always..

22:07.893 --> 22:10.420
I always loved that song.

22:16.912 --> 22:19.972
Melancholy, baby.

22:46.894 --> 22:48.590
Joker!

23:03.433 --> 23:05.895
It's my mother-in-law.

23:29.357 --> 23:33.747
They-they shouldn't be
out with those colds.

23:36.245 --> 23:38.506
And now people of Gotham City

23:38.508 --> 23:42.799
the moment you have
all been waiting for.

23:45.330 --> 23:47.225
The grande finale.

23:47.227 --> 23:49.754
The climax of my performance.

23:49.756 --> 23:52.316
The zenith of my career!

23:54.215 --> 24:01.134
The unmasking of Batman
and Robin the Boy Wonder.

24:03.433 --> 24:05.261
<i> Could this mean curtains?</i>

24:05.263 --> 24:08.588
<i> Will the identities</i>
<i> of our Dynamic Duo be</i>

24:08.590 --> 24:10.619
<i> revealed to the whole world?</i>

24:10.621 --> 24:15.477
<i> Is this the end of their</i>
<i> career as crime-fighters?</i>

24:15.479 --> 24:18.240
<i> Can they avert disaster?</i>

24:18.242 --> 24:20.436
<i> Answers, tomorrow.</i>

24:20.438 --> 24:22.366
<i> Same Bat-time.</i>

24:22.368 --> 24:25.161
