05:32.489 --> 05:34.721
Good dog, good dog.

05:34.721 --> 05:40.716
No! Puppy. Come here. Come back.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.833
Come here. Come back here. Here.

05:46.336 --> 05:50.079
No. Come back here. Come on.
Come here, come here!

05:50.079 --> 05:53.124
Come here. Bad dog. Sit down, down.

05:55.335 --> 05:57.826
You mad dog.

05:59.015 --> 06:01.299
No. Come here.

06:01.591 --> 06:05.167
Now, get away out. Get away out back.

06:32.361 --> 06:34.446
Mr. Oak!

07:19.053 --> 07:20.660
Bathsheba.

07:20.662 --> 07:22.983
She was here.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.784
I brought her a lamb. I thought
she might like to rear it.

07:27.510 --> 07:30.419
She might. Bathsheba.

07:30.419 --> 07:33.922
She should be here.
Would you care to wait?

07:33.922 --> 07:36.082
Thank you.

07:51.545 --> 07:54.017
If you'd like to leave
the lamb, I'll tell her.

07:55.684 --> 08:00.137
Well, the lamb isn't really the
business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.

08:01.628 --> 08:05.256
In short, I was going to ask
her if she'd like to be married.

08:05.257 --> 08:06.866
Were you, indeed?

08:06.867 --> 08:10.356
Because if she would, I'd
be very glad to marry her.

08:16.205 --> 08:19.417
Do you know if she has any other
men hanging about her at all?

08:19.427 --> 08:25.286
Dozens, I'm afraid.
One, two, three, dozens.

08:25.286 --> 08:27.821
Oh, that's unfortunate.

08:28.030 --> 08:33.212
I'm only an everyday sort of man and
my only chance was in being first comer.

08:35.193 --> 08:38.460
No use of my waiting, then.

08:39.447 --> 08:41.813
Well, I'll take myself off.

08:46.611 --> 08:49.688
Mr. Oak! Mr. Oak!

08:49.698 --> 08:53.232
- It's not true.
- What isn't?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.140
- Dozens.
- Oh.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.643
Not one nor two nor three.

08:57.842 --> 08:59.957
- I see.
- In fact, I haven't anyone at all.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.898
Well, I'm really and truly
very glad to hear that.

09:10.072 --> 09:14.639
- I've got a snug little farm.
- Yes, yes, you have.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.344
A man's advanced me money to
begin, but I shall pay that off...

09:17.345 --> 09:20.050
...soon as my sheep come to market.

09:21.616 --> 09:27.568
I'm only an everyday sort of man, but,
I've got on a little since I was a boy.

09:30.927 --> 09:34.054
And when we're married, I shall
work twice as hard as I do now.

09:35.411 --> 09:39.685
I know I can make you happy. You
shall have a piano in a year or two.

09:39.987 --> 09:42.385
Farmers' wives are
getting to have pianos now.

09:42.385 --> 09:44.639
Oh, I should like that.

09:44.460 --> 09:48.548
And I could practice up a flute.
Play for you in the evenings.

09:48.548 --> 09:53.063
You shall have one of those
10 pound gigs for market.

09:53.064 --> 09:55.784
- Really?
- And a frame for cucumbers.

09:57.359 --> 09:59.706
We'll have the wedding
put in the papers.

09:59.707 --> 10:03.636
- Oh, I should love that.
- And the babies in the list of births.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.585
And at home by the fire, whenever
I look up, there you will be.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.105
And whenever you look
up, there I shall be.

10:15.418 --> 10:19.392
I'm sorry, but it's no use.

10:19.392 --> 10:20.768
Why?

10:20.768 --> 10:23.979
Because I don't love you.

10:26.502 --> 10:30.090
Now, that is a tale. You chase after
a man, then you say you don't want him.

10:30.091 --> 10:31.310
I didn't chase after you.

10:31.357 --> 10:34.385
I just didn't want you thinking
I was any man's property.

10:37.827 --> 10:43.040
Look, Mr. Oak. You're a
farmer, just beginning.

10:43.042 --> 10:47.024
And in common prudence, you ought
to marry a woman with money...

10:47.025 --> 10:51.007
...who can clear you of debt
and stock up a good farm for you.

10:51.007 --> 10:53.958
That's the very thing
I've been thinking myself.

10:55.209 --> 10:57.493
Then why'd you come here bothering me?

10:59.275 --> 11:02.988
Perhaps because I can't
bring myself to be prudent.

11:02.989 --> 11:05.793
Oh, I see. And how could
you possibly expect me...

11:05.794 --> 11:08.597
to marry someone who can't be prudent?

11:08.597 --> 11:14.301
No, Bathsheba. I'll wait a while.

11:13.978 --> 11:17.063
I love you far more than common.

11:20.192 --> 11:24.937
I'm sorry, but I don't love you a bit.
So it'd be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

11:26.813 --> 11:28.304
Very well.

11:28.304 --> 11:31.099
Then I shall ask you no more.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.252
- Bye-bye, auntie.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

12:52.549 --> 12:55.351
- Get a message to me.
- I will.

12:55.352 --> 12:58.076
- Take care of her, Mr. Gibbons.
- Take care of yourself too.

13:03.264 --> 13:05.871
Don't forget to write to me!

16:18.242 --> 16:20.347
Boxey!

16:23.549 --> 16:26.261
Boxey!

17:04.424 --> 17:06.925
Thank God I'm not married.

17:39.094 --> 17:41.826
Form ranks there.

17:45.444 --> 17:48.656
Come on. Get into line.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.961
Frank. Frank.

18:23.566 --> 18:28.194
Fanny. Come on. Come on.

18:33.284 --> 18:36.193
What are you doing
here? I can't stop now.

18:36.297 --> 18:39.351
But you did say that I
could come and see you.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.657
You shouldn't be here.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.942
Frank? When will it be?

18:44.942 --> 18:46.777
When will what be?

18:46.777 --> 18:50.301
- The ceremony.
- The ceremony?

18:50.301 --> 18:51.771
The wedding.

18:53.639 --> 18:56.224
You did say time and
again we'd be married.

18:56.224 --> 19:00.561
If I said so, then we will.
Only, I can't stop now.

19:00.561 --> 19:02.438
You did mean it, didn't you, Frank?

19:03.752 --> 19:08.037
Fanny. Do I love you.

19:09.184 --> 19:10.967
Oh, Frank.

19:10.968 --> 19:13.532
Well, do I?

19:13.741 --> 19:17.088
You will get permission
from the officers, won't you?

19:17.088 --> 19:22.020
I'll get more than permission,
unless I get on. I'll lose my stripes.

19:22.022 --> 19:25.565
And you'll lose your week's
wages if you don't get back.

19:26.222 --> 19:28.287
As soon as we get our
posting, I'll send you word.

19:28.391 --> 19:30.893
- I'll come right away.
- You'll come when I tell you.

19:30.894 --> 19:32.524
And not a minute later.

19:33.010 --> 19:37.453
Now, don't be a doodle, Fanny.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.543
That's enough of that.

19:47.483 --> 19:48.902
Forward, march.

20:03.584 --> 20:05.346
You looking for a hand, sir?

20:05.348 --> 20:07.754
No. I'm looking for a place myself.

20:08.150 --> 20:10.882
- Do you anyone who needs a bailiff?
- Oh, that I don't.

20:19.745 --> 20:22.780
- How long have you been a shepherd?
- A year, sir.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.515
What work are you after?

20:28.515 --> 20:31.226
- Bailiff, sir.
- I'm wanting a shepherd.

20:55.624 --> 20:57.897
What about old Samway?

20:57.898 --> 21:00.171
There was no one better in his
day and there's work in him yet.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.289
Not enough for my acreage.

21:03.498 --> 21:05.135
You get him cheap.

21:17.126 --> 21:20.264
- Are you wanting a shepherd?
- No, a bailiff.

21:20.756 --> 21:23.610
- Seven shillings.
- I've got three children, I can't...

21:23.819 --> 21:25.039
Seven shillings a week and a cottage.

21:25.041 --> 21:28.366
- I don't know, sir. I was hoping 8.
- It's a good cottage.

21:28.367 --> 21:31.192
- Take it, Tom.
- I was hoping 8, sir.

21:31.194 --> 21:34.247
- No.
- All right, sir, all right.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.127
Whose farm were you last upon?

21:49.127 --> 21:51.546
My own, sir.

22:52.961 --> 22:57.226
Good night, Mr. Boldwood.
I'll race you home sometime.

23:20.239 --> 23:23.965
Her's a handsome body of
a woman, the new mistress.

23:25.154 --> 23:28.137
As far as looks are concerned, that is.

23:28.142 --> 23:32.073
So her do seem. So her do seem.

23:34.082 --> 23:36.385
Hey, boy, steady.

23:39.791 --> 23:44.933
They say, sir every night afore her goes
to bed, her sits in front of the mirror...

23:44.970 --> 23:47.934
...to see her nightcap's on proper.

23:50.070 --> 23:52.646
There's a vain female.

23:53.408 --> 23:55.733
And not a married woman.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.080
Of all the world.

23:59.695 --> 24:03.137
It were a funny thing to
do, leave a farm to a woman.

24:03.137 --> 24:08.078
I never thought old Mr. Everdene
would ever leave a farm to a woman.

24:09.037 --> 24:12.021
His nearest relation, she is. Ah.

24:17.714 --> 24:23.427
Looks in the glass to put on her
nightcap properly. Very vain female.

24:34.689 --> 24:41.559
Help, everyone!

24:43.647 --> 24:47.858
That were a funny thing to
do, leave a farm to a woman.

24:48.661 --> 24:52.540
Looks in her glass to put
on her nightcap properly.

24:52.728 --> 24:56.544
- That's a vain female.
- Her's a vain female, for sure.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.120
Hurry up, hurry up.

25:09.703 --> 25:13.520
The whole yard will go up.

25:23.262 --> 25:26.022
Where's the bailiff?
Where's Bailiff Pennyways?

25:26.607 --> 25:30.536
- Where's Bailiff Pennyways?
- Nobody's ever seen him, it's hopeless.

25:30.896 --> 25:34.345
I don't know where he
is in all this mess.

25:44.613 --> 25:46.887
Where's Bailiff Pennyways?
He must be somewhere.

25:46.887 --> 25:49.681
Just go and find him.
Go and find the bailiff.

25:55.105 --> 25:57.811
- Leave the rick alone.
- It's gone. It's hopeless, sir.

25:58.222 --> 26:01.317
- It's hopeless.
- No, it's not. Get rick tops.

26:01.487 --> 26:03.195
Rick tops. Rick tops.

26:03.331 --> 26:04.948
You, get water.

26:05.246 --> 26:07.458
Bring those underneath,
stop the draft underneath it.

26:07.459 --> 26:10.995
Water. Bring the water over here!

26:10.996 --> 26:13.761
This way.

26:19.972 --> 26:22.157
Make a line. Make a line. Make a line.

26:26.850 --> 26:31.160
Full buckets coming up.
The empty ones going down.

26:31.193 --> 26:33.278
Who's that giving orders?

26:33.280 --> 26:35.168
Bring the water over here.

26:35.169 --> 26:39.178
- Pass them down quicker.
- Buckets. Buckets.

26:39.179 --> 26:40.535
There goes the other rick.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.649
- Get the ladder.
- The ladder.

26:49.373 --> 26:50.788
Fetch your dad's claw.

26:53.183 --> 26:58.290
- Who is that man taking charge?
- Whoever he is, he saved your ricks.

27:06.551 --> 27:08.845
Where's Bailiff Pennyways?

27:27.748 --> 27:30.776
You want a shepherd, ma'am?

27:43.491 --> 27:45.576
Who's that?

27:45.577 --> 27:48.243
What are you doing here, Mr. Pennyways?

27:48.661 --> 27:51.420
It's you, Miss Everdene.
You startled me.

27:51.946 --> 27:57.150
- I was shifting some barley from the fire.
- Don't you lie to me like that.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.176
Leave that and get out.

27:59.599 --> 28:02.101
- Don't get the wrong idea, Miss Everdene.
- I haven't.

28:02.204 --> 28:05.007
Last count there were five
sacks missing. Now I know why.

28:05.008 --> 28:07.434
I want you off this farm before sunrise.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.862
Otherwise, I'll have you
thrown off. Do you understand?

28:09.863 --> 28:11.490
Give me the keys.

28:18.258 --> 28:24.760
- Laid at him like a tomcat, I heard.
- Did she?

28:39.727 --> 28:42.815
Question is, who's gonna be baily now?

28:49.369 --> 28:52.476
What kind of a place is this to live at?

28:52.477 --> 28:55.501
What kind of a missus
is she to work under?

28:55.880 --> 28:57.990
Her hasn't had the farm
above a couple of weeks.

28:57.991 --> 29:00.409
Her uncle was took bad,
doctor was sent for.

29:00.410 --> 29:02.827
But with all his worldwide
skill, he couldn't save the man.

29:10.607 --> 29:12.690
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.

29:12.691 --> 29:14.709
Before I begin, you ought to know...

29:14.710 --> 29:16.726
...that the bailiff has
been dismissed for thieving.

29:17.106 --> 29:20.674
- Pennyways?
- And I resolve to have no bailiff at all.

29:20.778 --> 29:23.322
I shall manage everything
with my own head and hands.

29:23.427 --> 29:27.671
So from now on, these keys
remain where I can find them.

29:29.777 --> 29:33.496
Now, there's 10 shillings on his
pay, for anyone who wants to stay.

29:33.533 --> 29:36.407
And no hard words for
anyone who wants to go.

29:37.502 --> 29:39.006
What do you say?

29:42.394 --> 29:44.579
I'll stay, miss.

29:45.902 --> 29:47.911
And I'll stay too, ma'am.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.222
Henery Fray.

29:51.475 --> 29:53.514
What's your name?

29:55.684 --> 29:59.411
Me? Cainy Ball.

29:59.412 --> 30:03.007
Cain? How did you come by such a name?

30:05.542 --> 30:12.398
It were like this, ma'am. My mother,
her not being a scripture-read woman...

30:12.399 --> 30:16.005
...made a mistake at my christening.

30:16.897 --> 30:27.563
Her thought that Abel killed Cain. And
her called me Cain mistaking Abel for Cain.

30:28.361 --> 30:31.705
How unfortunate for you.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.465
Thank you.

30:34.613 --> 30:39.200
We call him Cainy
because it sounds better.

30:39.723 --> 30:41.779
Andrew Randall.

30:42.558 --> 30:44.209
Will you stay?

30:44.673 --> 30:49.482
- Well, I...
- He can curse as well as you or I...

30:49.518 --> 30:52.000
But he can't say a
common speech to save him.

30:52.001 --> 30:55.272
If you're staying,
Andrew, just nod your head.

30:56.323 --> 31:00.005
Oh...

31:00.006 --> 31:03.685
Finish thanking me in a day or two.

31:05.055 --> 31:07.354
Laban Tall, will you stay with us?

31:07.458 --> 31:09.279
For you, or anyone
else who pays me well.

31:09.281 --> 31:11.914
- A man must live.
- Who's that woman?

31:11.915 --> 31:13.815
I be his lawful wife.

31:13.816 --> 31:15.428
Oh, you are?

31:15.429 --> 31:18.064
- Well, will you stay, Laban?
- He'll stay, ma'am.

31:18.065 --> 31:20.264
I suppose he can speak for himself.

31:20.265 --> 31:24.433
Oh, Lord, ma'am, not he.
Poor gawk-hammer mortal.

31:25.060 --> 31:27.815
Thank you, ma'am.

31:28.413 --> 31:30.017
Fanny Robin.

31:30.643 --> 31:33.942
Born on the farm. Brought up by
your uncle, one of the family.

31:33.943 --> 31:37.762
Oh, I hope you'll remain so.
Two shillings and sixpence.

31:37.763 --> 31:38.901
Thank you, ma'am.

31:38.902 --> 31:41.411
Temperance and Soberness Miller.

31:41.412 --> 31:43.030
Both women, I suppose.

31:43.031 --> 31:46.313
- Here we be.
- Here we be, ma'am.

31:46.596 --> 31:47.776
What do you do?

31:47.777 --> 31:51.506
Tend the threshing machine,
wimble haybonds, ma'am

31:51.520 --> 31:54.366
and say whoosh to the cocks
when they go upon the seeds.

31:54.377 --> 31:58.968
And plant Early Flourballs and
Thompson's Wonderfuls with a dibble.

32:00.348 --> 32:02.647
Are they satisfactory women?

32:02.753 --> 32:06.234
Yielding women, ma'am. As
scarlet a pair as ever you saw.

32:06.235 --> 32:08.399
-Sit down.
- Who, ma'am?

32:08.503 --> 32:09.800
Sit down.

32:10.387 --> 32:15.319
Temperance and Soberness,
live up to your names.

32:19.804 --> 32:24.490
Joseph Poorgrass, I'll
stay, sir. Ma'am, I meant.

32:25.117 --> 32:28.319
Thank you.

32:32.199 --> 32:33.729
This is the new shepherd, miss.

32:34.413 --> 32:36.381
Oh, yes.

32:36.382 --> 32:38.724
You understand your duties?

32:38.725 --> 32:41.046
Quite well, thank you, Miss Everdene.

32:41.729 --> 32:43.833
And if I'm in any doubt, I'll inquire.

32:47.246 --> 32:49.238
Thank you.

32:52.470 --> 32:58.138
You know, I don't yet know my
powers or my talents in farming...

32:58.139 --> 33:00.097
...but I shall do my best.

33:00.098 --> 33:03.498
And if you serve me well,
so shall I serve you.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.300
Don't let anyone suppose that
because I'm a woman...

33:06.319 --> 33:10.063
I don't understand the difference
between bad goings-on and good.

33:10.302 --> 33:11.930
I shall be up before you're awake.

33:11.931 --> 33:14.215
I shall be afield before you are up...

33:14.216 --> 33:16.766
...and I shall have breakfasted
before you're afield.

33:16.902 --> 33:20.106
In short, I shall astonish you all.

33:22.285 --> 33:28.052
What a mess. I don't know what he
wanted all these old papers for.

33:28.625 --> 33:33.889
- Don't you feel that way?
- Oh, excellent, you are so strong.

33:33.890 --> 33:35.581
- All right with it?
- Mm.

33:35.582 --> 33:37.016
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

33:37.017 --> 33:41.557
- I wonder if I shall be able to keep it up.
- Oh, yes, of course you will.

33:42.778 --> 33:45.079
Yes, I will.

33:48.815 --> 33:51.710
Look what I found, miss. A valentine.

33:52.023 --> 33:54.733
Be a pity not to send it,
seeing it's the season.

33:54.735 --> 33:56.403
Oh, yes, so it is.

33:57.308 --> 34:00.717
Isn't that lovely? I'll send
it to one of the Coggan boys.

34:00.718 --> 34:03.459
They'd love it.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.006
- Yes.
- Oh, that's lovely. Thank you, Maryann.

34:11.914 --> 34:15.123
He's ridden right up to the front door.

34:15.983 --> 34:18.068
Impertinence! I'm not seeing
anyone who behaves like that.

34:18.105 --> 34:20.089
And I don't care who it is.

34:20.402 --> 34:22.235
Who is it?

34:22.235 --> 34:26.233
It's Mr. Boldwood. He's got the farm
opposite. I wonder what he wants.

34:28.598 --> 34:30.911
Why doesn't someone answer
the door? He'll ride away.

34:30.992 --> 34:33.634
- You're gonna see him, then?
- Why, no. Of course not.

34:33.635 --> 34:36.752
I don't want him to go without
knowing I'm not gonna see him.

34:37.770 --> 34:41.313
- Oh, Maryann, you go.
- I can't go like this, miss.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.275
He'll ride away.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.137
Fanny!

34:45.889 --> 34:47.585
Where is the girl?

34:54.543 --> 34:58.534
- Oh, Mr. Boldwood.
- Is Miss Everdene in, Mrs. Coggan?

34:58.535 --> 35:00.160
I'll see, sir.

35:03.008 --> 35:04.735
No.

35:04.975 --> 35:09.702
I'm sorry, sir. Miss is dusting bottles and
it's quite an object. Begs to excuse her.

35:09.805 --> 35:13.539
I was just wondering if she wanted any
advice, what with the fire and so on.

35:13.540 --> 35:16.484
Tell her I'll be too
happy to be of service.

35:16.485 --> 35:19.427
I'll tell her, sir. I'm
sure she'll be grateful.

35:23.495 --> 35:26.631
- Morning, Mr. Boldwood.
- Morning, Fray.

35:26.632 --> 35:29.767
Tell your mistress if she needs any
help, not to be too proud to ask.

35:29.768 --> 35:34.665
I will that, sir. We're like England
herself now, with a queen at the helm.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.935
Indeed. I wish you joy of that.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.640
Mr. Boldwood. Is there a Mrs. Boldwood?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.126
No.

35:44.127 --> 35:48.275
Never was there such a hopeless man for a
woman. Been courted by sixes and sevens.

35:48.447 --> 35:52.348
All the girls, gentle and simple,
for miles around have tried him.

35:52.349 --> 35:55.734
Janey Perkins worked him
for two months, like a slave.

35:55.735 --> 36:00.411
He cost Farmer lves' daughters nights
of tears and 20 pounds in new clothes.

36:00.412 --> 36:03.644
Oh, he's married to his
farm. That's the truth of it.

36:03.851 --> 36:09.187
There's no woman can touch him, miss.
'Tis said he has no passionate parts.

36:22.639 --> 36:26.719
- Did anybody ever want to marry you?
- Oh, lots of them, I dare say.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.811
A man wanted to, once.

36:31.547 --> 36:33.757
- How nice it must seem.
- Ha, ha.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.925
And you wouldn't have him?

36:35.926 --> 36:38.438
He wasn't good enough for me.

36:38.849 --> 36:43.392
- Did you love him, miss?
- Oh, no, but I did rather like him.

36:45.591 --> 36:50.753
Come along. It'll do the work
of 10 men, and do it better.

36:51.307 --> 36:53.648
So don't let's have any
shaking of heads. Come along.

36:53.803 --> 36:59.433
I want one man on the bags and
two at the back to clear the straw.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.128
Come on, it won't attack you.

37:02.110 --> 37:05.826
Come along. Two at the back.

37:07.911 --> 37:13.032
The rose is red, The violet blue
Carnation's sweet And so are you

37:17.307 --> 37:20.044
- Do you know what I'd like to do?
- What?

37:20.045 --> 37:22.379
Send this to Mr. Boldwood.

37:22.380 --> 37:25.580
- Well, he'll not be amused, miss.
- Do you think I shouldn't?

37:27.015 --> 37:30.157
- Oh, yeah, go on. Go on.
- Yes, I'm going to.

37:30.367 --> 37:32.741
Where's some ink? I saw some...
Oh, there it is.

37:58.393 --> 38:02.494
-

38:09.322 --> 38:11.196
- Tomorrow at 11:00.
- Yes.

38:11.410 --> 38:13.601
At All Saints.

38:15.374 --> 38:21.297
- Don't you be late.
- Oh, Frank.

39:18.544 --> 39:20.633
Eyes on me. Tuba.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.450
Tuba.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.758
Eyes on the leader.

40:06.778 --> 40:09.767
She will have to be here in the
next quarter of an hour, you know.

40:29.266 --> 40:33.186
- Is this the All Saints Church?
- This is the Garrison Church of All Souls.

40:55.843 --> 40:59.777
Oh, Frank. Oh, Frank. Thank heavens.

40:59.778 --> 41:03.322
Oh, I made a terrible
mistake. Can you believe it?

41:03.324 --> 41:06.048
I thought the
Garrison Church was All Saints.

41:06.096 --> 41:09.382
And then I realized. But
it's all right, isn't it, Frank?

41:09.383 --> 41:12.839
I mean, it can
always be tomorrow, can't it?

41:14.653 --> 41:17.197
You fool, for so fooling me.

41:18.136 --> 41:22.527
Oh, Frank, I am sorry. But
it can be tomorrow, can't it?

41:22.528 --> 41:25.243
Can it? You made a fool out of me.

41:25.244 --> 41:29.269
- Well, when will it be, Frank?
- I don't know. I don't know.

41:30.210 --> 41:33.502
I said I was sorry!

42:04.723 --> 42:07.204
-

42:14.108 --> 42:18.015
Why, I wouldn't give you
45 shillings a quart for it.

42:18.016 --> 42:21.586
- 45 shillings a quart?
- No, not 45 shillings.

42:35.660 --> 42:38.088
Good morning, miss.

42:38.089 --> 42:43.179
Good morning. I wonder if you could help
me. Where would I get the best corn seed?

42:43.409 --> 42:44.996
You've come to the right place.

42:44.997 --> 42:48.337
That's old Everdene's niece.

42:48.338 --> 42:50.954
Sam here has the finest in the county.

42:51.059 --> 42:54.217
Trouble is, it's gone the
moment he sets his foot in the exchange.

42:54.218 --> 42:57.149
'Tis true. 'Tis true.
I haven't got a sack left.

42:57.150 --> 43:00.424
Still, I dare say, you
could thresh an extra sack or two?

43:00.425 --> 43:02.418
Well, I dare say, I might, possibly.

43:02.419 --> 43:06.243
But, mark you, 60 shillings a sack
is what I've been offered.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.023
Sixty shillings?

43:08.024 --> 43:11.115
You'll not find better than
that, miss, wherever you go.

43:11.292 --> 43:13.418
Here, have a look on
it. There's no nose to it.

43:13.557 --> 43:16.754
You won't find better
grain than that in the market.

43:20.026 --> 43:23.253
Well, now, I know nothing
about these matters, it's obvious.

43:23.254 --> 43:25.165
Oh, you can trust Sam, miss.

43:25.184 --> 43:31.665
Or I'd say that this was a fusty,
pinched, no-good parcel of pig fodder.

44:39.432 --> 44:42.496
Stay.

45:44.121 --> 45:47.770
Gabriel. Good morning.

45:47.772 --> 45:49.048
Well, miss?

45:49.049 --> 45:51.914
I've been checking the records.
We've never had so many lambs...

45:51.915 --> 45:54.782
...come to maturity
as this year. Not ever.

45:54.783 --> 45:56.361
Well, we've been lucky, miss.

45:56.362 --> 45:58.178
I've been lucky.

46:31.546 --> 46:33.469
Morning.

46:33.470 --> 46:35.809
Morning, Mr. Boldwood.

46:37.894 --> 46:41.796
- Good morning, Miss Everdene.
- Mr. Boldwood. Good morning.

46:43.718 --> 46:45.989
I have come, hoping
that I might speak to you.

46:46.577 --> 46:49.962
Yes. Yes, of course.

47:11.186 --> 47:14.657
I feel almost too much to think.

47:16.117 --> 47:19.646
But I've come to
talk to you without preface.

47:20.600 --> 47:24.416
My life has not been my own
since I've beheld you clearly.

47:25.338 --> 47:29.347
Miss Everdene, I've come to
make you my offer of marriage.

47:31.157 --> 47:38.019
Beyond everything, everything I
ever believed I want you as my wife.

47:40.978 --> 47:44.803
It will be a good thing to put
the whole valley under one master.

47:45.012 --> 47:48.630
What's her got to get married for?
Her's strong enough to fight her battles.

47:48.631 --> 47:51.759
Well, he's a fine man.
She'd be lucky to have him.

47:51.928 --> 47:58.153
Shouldn't I like to kiss her.
Oh. Smack her on her cherry-red lips.

48:00.655 --> 48:04.599
That's enough of that
smack-and-coddle style of yours, Mark Clark.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.801
Do you understand?

48:10.648 --> 48:14.799
I would never have spoken
out had I not been led to hope.

48:14.800 --> 48:17.656
Oh, that foolish valentine.

48:17.657 --> 48:19.374
Foolish?

48:20.835 --> 48:24.085
That foolish, wanton valentine.

48:24.816 --> 48:28.377
If you can only forgive
me for my thoughtlessness.

48:28.378 --> 48:30.075
No, don't say thoughtlessness.

48:31.015 --> 48:34.560
Made me believe it was something
more, a sort of prophetic instinct.

48:34.843 --> 48:39.364
The beginning of a
feeling that you would like me.

48:39.450 --> 48:42.503
You shall have everything you want.

48:42.504 --> 48:45.555
No worries. No household cares.
No thought of weather in the harvest.

48:47.015 --> 48:51.193
I wish I could put my
feelings into more graceful shape.

48:52.856 --> 48:55.616
Miss Everdene, if you could...

48:57.141 --> 48:59.692
I do not love you, Mr. Boldwood.

48:59.693 --> 49:01.994
Certainly, I must say that.

49:01.995 --> 49:06.623
Say, at least, that you
do not refuse me absolutely.

49:08.449 --> 49:12.724
God only knows how much you mean to me.

49:13.486 --> 49:17.538
- I don't know what to say.
- Then say nothing.

49:17.747 --> 49:21.802
And let me speak to
you again upon the matter.

49:24.942 --> 49:27.069
I'm afraid they will notice us.

49:26.027 --> 49:31.582
- May I call on you tomorrow?
- Oh, no, please.

49:31.686 --> 49:33.617
You must give me time.

49:33.618 --> 49:35.562
Any time.

49:37.163 --> 49:41.994
- I'm happier now.
- I beg you, you mustn't think...

49:42.454 --> 49:44.748
No, no, no. I must think.

49:44.858 --> 49:48.875
Yes. And I will wait.

50:28.917 --> 50:31.152
Gabriel.

50:33.193 --> 50:34.927
Are you there?

50:36.187 --> 50:39.813
Gabriel. Is that you?

50:41.040 --> 50:43.125
Yes, miss.

50:46.983 --> 50:48.369
Did you not hear me calling?

50:49.188 --> 50:51.013
No, miss.

50:55.340 --> 50:58.589
I wondered whether
everything was ready for the shearing.

50:58.590 --> 51:03.334
Oh, yes, indeed, miss.
You needn't worry on that score.

51:04.379 --> 51:07.451
Tell me, Gabriel, did the men...

51:07.452 --> 51:10.523
...make any observation on
my going off with Mr. Boldwood?

51:10.733 --> 51:12.632
Yes, they did.

51:15.711 --> 51:17.563
Did they think it odd?

51:17.877 --> 51:20.781
No, miss, not odd.

51:20.782 --> 51:23.142
Well, what did they say?

51:23.983 --> 51:28.810
That Boldwood's name and your own were
likely to be flung over pulpit together.

51:28.882 --> 51:32.800
Oh, that's absolute nonsense.
There's not a word of truth in it.

51:32.811 --> 51:34.786
And I want you to tell them so, Gabriel.

51:34.787 --> 51:37.145
Well, now, Bathsheba...

51:37.146 --> 51:38.639
Miss Everdene, you mean.

51:40.535 --> 51:43.172
I mean this, Miss Everdene, I mean this.

51:43.792 --> 51:46.294
If Mr. Boldwood really
spoke to you of marriage...

51:46.295 --> 51:49.006
...I am not gonna put it about
that he didn't just to please you.

51:49.082 --> 51:52.077
I already tried to please
you too much for my own good.

51:52.079 --> 51:55.967
I only want you to tell them
that I'm not going to marry him.

51:55.968 --> 51:58.635
Not that there'd be
any shame in it if I were.

51:58.636 --> 52:02.093
However, I'm not, and I'd
be glad if you told them so.

52:02.094 --> 52:06.195
I can say that to them,
if you wish, Miss Everdene.

52:06.196 --> 52:09.225
Likewise, I could give an
opinion to you on what you've done.

52:09.328 --> 52:13.547
I dare say you can. But
I don't want your opinion.

52:20.714 --> 52:23.534
Well, what is your opinion?

52:23.982 --> 52:25.678
That it's unworthy.

52:27.243 --> 52:29.587
I'm sorry if that
sounds like a reprimand.

52:29.588 --> 52:30.836
Oh, no, not at all.

52:30.837 --> 52:33.494
As far as I'm
concerned, a reprimand from you...

52:33.495 --> 52:36.567
...is the same as a
compliment from anyone of real judgment.

52:41.252 --> 52:45.182
And where in
particular lies my unworthiness?

52:45.183 --> 52:47.358
In not marrying you, perhaps?

52:55.689 --> 53:00.902
My opinion is that you are blame for
playing pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood.

53:01.005 --> 53:03.227
Leading a man on you
don't care for, for the fun of it.

53:03.228 --> 53:05.235
Just to satisfy your own vanity.

53:05.438 --> 53:07.905
How dare you
criticize my personal conduct.

53:07.906 --> 53:11.464
- You invited it.
- I will not allow any man to criticize me.

53:11.465 --> 53:13.302
I won't have you a moment longer.

53:13.304 --> 53:16.007
Very well. In that
case, I shall be glad to go.

53:16.015 --> 53:19.831
- Go then, in heaven's name.
- Very good, Miss Everdene.

54:15.362 --> 54:16.879
Can't you do anything?

54:16.880 --> 54:20.049
There's only one man in
the county that knows the trick.

54:20.050 --> 54:23.805
Well, get him. Go on, hurry.

54:24.583 --> 54:26.259
Shepherd Oak, missus.

54:27.115 --> 54:29.243
I won't have him on this farm.

54:32.165 --> 54:34.544
How about Farmer Boldwood? He'll know.

54:34.647 --> 54:38.112
He haven't got the touch,
saving your presence, not with animals.

54:38.113 --> 54:41.967
They'll all be as dead as nits
if they bain't be gut out and cured.

54:45.169 --> 54:50.992
I won't have him on this
farm. I won't, I won't, I won't.

55:00.074 --> 55:04.072
She says you must come at once, Gabriel.

55:04.910 --> 55:09.517
Must? You go tell
your mistress for me...

55:09.622 --> 55:11.506
...that beggars can't be...

55:11.507 --> 55:13.143
..."choosers," he says.

55:13.144 --> 55:16.482
And you must ask him civil.

55:16.483 --> 55:22.426
As becomes any human being
begging a favor from another.

55:32.623 --> 55:34.824
I won't.

55:38.878 --> 55:42.212
-

57:57.352 --> 57:59.047
Go. Yip. Yip.

58:15.904 --> 58:17.990
Get on. Get up.

58:17.992 --> 58:22.307
Get on now.

58:26.894 --> 58:29.749
-

58:32.253 --> 58:34.178
Gabriel.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.624
Gabriel.

58:43.698 --> 58:47.584
Would you stay on with us, please?

58:48.457 --> 58:51.419
I will.

59:29.503 --> 59:31.898
Now, Master
Poorgrass, what about your song?

59:33.849 --> 59:41.015
Don't be ungrateful, Joseph.
Mistress is looking hard at you.

59:34.611 --> 59:38.017
I be all but in liquor
and the gift is wanting in me.

59:41.118 --> 59:46.164
- Come on. Come on, now.
- Yeah, come on. "Seeds of Love."

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.778
Mr. Boldwood, how nice to see you.

01:01:27.198 --> 01:01:28.820
Good evening, Miss Everdene.

01:01:29.694 --> 01:01:31.780
Evening.

01:01:33.331 --> 01:01:36.128
Gabriel, would you...?

01:01:36.129 --> 01:01:38.203
Will you sit down, Mr. Boldwood?

01:01:38.204 --> 01:01:39.768
- Thank you, Oak.
- All right.

01:01:44.394 --> 01:01:46.479
- Will you sing us a song, mistress?
- Liddy.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.070
Gabriel.

01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:54.991
- Yes?
- Do you have your flute?

01:01:56.854 --> 01:01:58.863
- Will you play if I sing?
- Well, what shall it be, miss?

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:02.552
"Bushes and Briars."

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:07.537
Now, let's have a bit
of quiet for the mistress.

01:03:55.142 --> 01:03:58.170
- Thank you, mistress.
- That's great.

01:04:02.446 --> 01:04:06.279
- Good night.
- Thank you very much.

01:04:28.229 --> 01:04:33.443
If I can believe in any way
that I could make you a good wife...

01:04:33.444 --> 01:04:35.335
...I will indeed
be willing to marry you.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.992
- Miss Everdene.
- But I cannot promise yet.

01:04:38.993 --> 01:04:41.182
And I have not promised tonight.

01:04:41.183 --> 01:04:46.066
You shall not regret it. If it's
in my power, you shall not regret it.

01:04:47.213 --> 01:04:49.317
When can I hope to hear?

01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:53.408
Why, I shall not keep you in
suspense a moment longer than I need.

01:04:53.409 --> 01:04:56.694
- Please, don't decide hastily.
- No, no, I won't.

01:05:00.409 --> 01:05:03.492
Perhaps... Perhaps...

01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:04.908
...by harvest time?

01:05:04.909 --> 01:05:07.401
By harvest time.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:12.740
- By harvest time I shall know.
- Yes, you shall have your answer.

01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:19.825
But please remember,
I have not promised yet.

01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:19.072
Good night, mate.

01:06:19.073 --> 01:06:20.946
Good night.

01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:23.643
Let me go.

01:06:23.644 --> 01:06:26.084
I haven't got you.

01:06:26.085 --> 01:06:27.589
Is it a woman?

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:29.101
You have.

01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:30.585
And it is.

01:06:31.647 --> 01:06:33.987
A lady, I should've said.

01:06:34.915 --> 01:06:37.397
If you'll just give
me the lantern a moment...

01:06:39.511 --> 01:06:42.364
...I’ll unfasten you in no time.

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:45.957
Please do. I'm in a hurry.

01:06:46.199 --> 01:06:49.362
Oh, dear. Oh, dear me.

01:06:49.363 --> 01:06:51.505
It could be a long business. Mm.

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:58.632
Uh, unless you want me
to, uh, cut the material.

01:06:57.459 --> 01:07:00.660
Then cut it.

01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:03.786
You don't want me to do that. No need.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:07.931
If you'll just, hang on a moment,
I'll,...

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:12.304
Hold still. Be patient, patient.

01:07:12.305 --> 01:07:15.200
You're not doing anything.

01:07:15.201 --> 01:07:17.290
I'm looking at a beautiful face.

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:20.429
One of the most
beautiful faces I've ever seen.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.468
Well, it's unwillingly shown.

01:07:22.469 --> 01:07:27.096
I like you the better for
that incivility, I must say.

01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:30.054
You're making it worse on purpose.

01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:33.481
- Please go and leave me here.
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:36.698
If I go, I shall drag you with me.

01:07:36.699 --> 01:07:40.269
And, uh, ha, ha, if I leave you here,...

01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:44.902
...well, I'm absolutely
bound to stay and keep you company.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.029
Who are you?

01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:50.438
- Sergeant Troy, ma'am.
- What are you doing here?

01:07:50.439 --> 01:07:54.531
Before I entered the
service of Her Majesty...

01:07:54.532 --> 01:07:55.673
...I used to live here.

01:07:56.187 --> 01:07:58.611
I always come back for haymaking.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.252
There we are. Free.

01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:08.735
I only wished it had been the
knot of knots. There's no untying.

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:28.999
...beauty.

01:08:25.328 --> 01:08:26.805
Good night...

01:09:30.327 --> 01:09:33.710
Ah, Miss Everdene,
little did I think it was you...

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:37.960
...the queen of the corn marketer
herself, I was speaking to the other night.

01:09:38.881 --> 01:09:42.714
I'm sorry if I offended
you. But it does seem a bit hard.

01:09:42.715 --> 01:09:44.563
What seems hard?

01:09:44.743 --> 01:09:49.613
That ill luck should follow a man for
honestly telling a woman she's beautiful.

01:09:49.613 --> 01:09:52.304
It's not your
honesty I take exception to.

01:09:52.305 --> 01:09:54.400
It's your impudence.

01:09:54.401 --> 01:09:56.670
Miss Everdene...

01:09:55.997 --> 01:10:10.332
A woman like you does more
damage than she can conceivably imagine.

01:09:57.037 --> 01:09:59.568
...you do forgive me, don't you?

01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:01.105
I do not.

01:10:01.106 --> 01:10:03.892
How can you blame me for your looks?

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:14.096
Please go away. I'd
rather you didn't talk to me again.

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:20.123
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you since I first met you.

01:10:20.124 --> 01:10:23.063
- Oh.
- Honestly.

01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:26.218
I loved you then, at once...

01:10:26.429 --> 01:10:28.985
...and I do now.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:35.012
It's not possible. There's
no such sudden feeling in people.

01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:47.846
Evening, Gabriel.

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:37.222
Sergeant Troy reporting
for sword exercise, ma'am.

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.626
Sit down.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:54.299
First, I'll show you the cuts.

01:11:55.952 --> 01:11:58.613
Cut one, as if you were sowing corn.

01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:03.960
Cut two, as if you were hedging.

01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:06.416
Cut three, as if you were reaping.

01:12:08.568 --> 01:12:11.003
And four, as though you were threshing.

01:12:10.783 --> 01:12:16.735
And from the left:
One. Two. Three. Four.

01:12:16.736 --> 01:12:20.364
Now I'll show you how
they look in action. Stand up.

01:12:23.365 --> 01:12:26.074
- You're the enemy, right?
- No!

01:12:26.337 --> 01:12:30.841
- You're not scared, are you?
- No.

01:12:31.057 --> 01:12:34.398
Because if you're
scared, I can't perform.

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:37.927
I promise I won't touch you. Don't move.

01:12:37.928 --> 01:12:42.741
- Is it very sharp?
- No, got no edge at all.

01:12:43.004 --> 01:12:44.871
Hold still.

01:12:55.401 --> 01:12:57.104
Are you sure you're not scared?

01:12:57.105 --> 01:12:59.362
Sure

01:12:59.572 --> 01:13:01.953
Of course, we
usually do them from horseback.

01:13:01.954 --> 01:13:04.139
I'll show you.

01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:28.246
Hold still. There's a
caterpillar on you. Don't move.

01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:33.668
Wait a moment.

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:37.125
There's a lock of hair needs tidying.

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:44.469
Bravely borne. Wonderful in a woman.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:47.885
How did you do that
with a sword that has no edge?

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:49.340
No edge?

01:14:49.341 --> 01:14:51.606
This sword will shave like a razor.

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.751
But you said it...

01:14:55.355 --> 01:14:58.454
- I've been within an inch of my life.
- I wouldn't say that.

01:14:58.455 --> 01:15:00.459
I'd say half an inch...

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.699
...of being pared alive 295 times.

01:16:26.656 --> 01:16:29.895
If he marry her, she'll
give up farming, all right.

01:16:26.768 --> 01:16:33.571
Well, I wish I had half such a
husband. I'd give up farming, all right.

01:16:34.344 --> 01:16:38.109
I've heard he's had almost as many
girls as there are letters in the alphabet.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:40.764
Mistress will be Y or Z, at the least.

01:16:41.447 --> 01:16:44.803
Temperance, Money,
you're dreadful.XXXXXXX

01:16:45.285 --> 01:16:49.066
I heard what you said. So
don't waste time denying it.

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:59.855
I simply want you to know I
don't care for Mr. Troy in the least.

01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:02.983
- So don't let me catch you gossiping again.
- We wouldn't.

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:06.696
Because I don't care
for him. In fact, I hate him.

01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:08.678
Do you understand? Hate him.

01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:11.136
- I hate him too, miss.
- We all hate him, miss.

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:13.374
He's a wild scamp.
You do right to hate him.

01:17:13.492 --> 01:17:16.471
What do you mean wild
scamp? How dare you to my face.

01:17:16.472 --> 01:17:19.060
By what right have you
to hate him? You or anyone?

01:17:19.338 --> 01:17:21.674
Not that I care for him. I don't.

01:17:21.675 --> 01:17:23.458
I don't.

01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:31.427
If I catch any of you saying a word
against him I’ll have you dismissed instantly.

01:17:31.428 --> 01:17:33.486
Understand?

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:43.100
It's your fault. What you said that for?

01:17:47.178 --> 01:17:49.712
You gossip. Oh, stop. It's not funny.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.510
Storm's passing now, miss.

01:18:26.563 --> 01:18:28.906
Fine tomorrow.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.897
I hope you're not still angry, miss.

01:18:31.898 --> 01:18:34.547
Angry? Oh, no, no.

01:18:34.548 --> 01:18:37.119
People always say such foolery.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:41.218
From now on I'm gonna tell them, "A
lady like Miss Everdene can't love him."

01:18:41.219 --> 01:18:43.163
I'll say that in plain black and white.

01:18:44.165 --> 01:18:46.339
You fool, can't you see?

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:49.917
- Aren't you a woman yourself?
- Miss?

01:18:49.918 --> 01:18:54.939
I love him to the very
distraction and misery and agony.

01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:00.370
Liddy, come here.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:09.164
Tell me, the things they say about him,
tell me they're not true, are they?

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:14.790
No, miss. I don't...
No, I'm sure they're not true.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.551
You only agree with
me like that to please me.

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:22.103
- He can't be bad as they said. D'you hear?
- Yes, miss, yes.

01:19:22.104 --> 01:19:24.244
And you don't believe he is?

01:19:24.245 --> 01:19:26.735
Well, I don't know what to say, miss.

01:19:26.736 --> 01:19:30.175
If I say no, you don't believe
me. If I say yes, you rage at me.

01:19:30.176 --> 01:19:33.616
Well, say you don't
believe it. Say you don't!

01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:38.056
I don't believe him to be so
bad as they make out.

01:19:38.057 --> 01:19:41.253
He's not bad at all. I know he isn't.

01:19:41.741 --> 01:19:44.924
It's just jealousy and
gossip that makes them say so.

01:19:45.075 --> 01:19:46.648
Anyway, he's not here...

01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:50.377
...for a few days.

01:19:51.339 --> 01:19:53.767
I don't often cry, do l, Lid?

01:19:55.717 --> 01:19:59.186
Why is loving such a misery?

01:20:02.734 --> 01:20:06.567
- I shall be ruined, Lid. I know I shall.
- Oh, no, miss.

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:09.340
If he comes back to Weatherbury...

01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:12.818
Then he must not, miss.

01:20:13.026 --> 01:20:15.939
He mustn't come back here.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:22.314
No...he mustn't.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.041
Ladies and gentlemen, and listen
to a tale of adventure...

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:19.621
...of a life of which you
have never heard before.

01:21:19.996 --> 01:21:24.550
This is the tale of
Captain Cook, and this is his ship.

01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:29.889
From there, he
sailed on into uncharted seas.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.989
Never before entered by civilized man.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:42.018
At last, they sighted land,
and soon they arrived at Tahiti.

01:21:42.019 --> 01:21:45.986
The paradisiacal
island of the South Seas

01:21:45.987 --> 01:21:50.029
Where everyone went naked,
as you can see.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:53.198
And lavish entertainment
was offered to them.

01:21:53.519 --> 01:22:00.065
Including dancing girls and
other delights of forbidden fruits.

01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:06.002
But all was not beer and
skittles, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:06.003 --> 01:22:08.680
For to their horror and dismay...

01:22:08.681 --> 01:22:16.241
...the captain and his crew were
present next day as a human sacrifice.

01:22:16.242 --> 01:22:21.807
At which the unfortunate
victim was tied up...

01:23:38.153 --> 01:23:40.237
Is it working better now, Parsons?

01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:42.577
All right now, Mr. Boldwood, sir.

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:35.528
Oh, Mr. Boldwood.

01:25:36.049 --> 01:25:39.273
- Good evening, Liddy.
- Good evening, sir.

01:25:39.274 --> 01:25:41.695
Your mistress is back?

01:25:41.696 --> 01:25:43.180
Well, um...

01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:46.294
- She's tired?
- Rather, sir.

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:49.078
You think I might see her for a moment?

01:25:49.079 --> 01:25:53.285
Oh, she cannot see you,
sir, at present. Um, not anyone.

01:25:53.286 --> 01:25:56.310
Yes, I see. I see.

01:25:56.919 --> 01:26:00.185
Um, would you tell
her that I called her?

01:26:00.186 --> 01:26:03.215
Yes, sir. Good night.

01:26:23.198 --> 01:26:26.319
- Much obliged to you, James.
- Cheerio, Troy.

01:26:34.172 --> 01:26:36.116
Sergeant Troy?

01:26:36.436 --> 01:26:38.057
That's my name.

01:26:38.357 --> 01:26:40.083
I'm William Boldwood.

01:26:40.199 --> 01:26:42.420
Oh, yes, good evening.

01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:44.994
I want a word with you.

01:26:44.995 --> 01:26:50.156
About her who lives up there.

01:26:50.782 --> 01:26:54.788
And a woman you've cruelly
wronged. And should have married.

01:26:54.825 --> 01:26:59.424
- Really? I wonder at your impertinence.
- You're gonna have a conversation with me.

01:26:59.425 --> 01:27:04.003
Very well. No need to raise your voice.

01:27:04.422 --> 01:27:07.982
I know about you and Fanny Robin.

01:27:07.983 --> 01:27:09.812
Do you, now?

01:27:09.813 --> 01:27:11.560
You ought to marry her.

01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:14.037
I suppose you're right.
Unfortunately, I can't.

01:27:14.038 --> 01:27:15.080
Why not?

01:27:16.671 --> 01:27:19.116
First of all, she's disappeared.

01:27:19.117 --> 01:27:23.050
And secondly I’m too poor.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.128
I may as well speak plainly.

01:27:27.129 --> 01:27:29.838
I don't wish to enter into the
question of right or wrong.

01:27:30.113 --> 01:27:33.552
I intend a business transaction with you.

01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:36.220
I see.

01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:42.186
Leave Weatherbury, now and
you'll take 50 pounds with you.

01:27:42.753 --> 01:27:48.316
Fanny will have 50 to prepare for marriage
and 500 for you on the day of the wedding

01:27:48.378 --> 01:27:50.818
What do you say?

01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:54.712
- Is that reasonable?
- Yes, very.

01:27:55.547 --> 01:27:58.953
Fifty pounds, right away, did you say?

01:27:59.996 --> 01:28:01.873
Yes.

01:28:04.271 --> 01:28:07.321
Seems you've counted on me accepting.

01:28:10.138 --> 01:28:13.007
I'm afraid she's expecting me.

01:28:13.008 --> 01:28:16.740
- I suppose I better wish her goodbye.
- I don't see the necessity.

01:28:16.741 --> 01:28:19.267
Can't you just go?

01:28:19.268 --> 01:28:22.563
She'll only wander
around looking for me.

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:24.719
You know women.

01:28:25.699 --> 01:28:27.044
Tell you what.

01:28:27.589 --> 01:28:29.674
You shall hear all I say to her.

01:28:29.675 --> 01:28:32.833
It'll help you in your
lovemaking when I'm gone.

01:28:35.686 --> 01:28:37.547
Wait there.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:45.953
Frank, darling. Is that
you? Oh, Frank. It's been so long.

01:28:47.486 --> 01:28:51.554
You go in. I've left
my bag. I won't be a moment.

01:29:06.923 --> 01:29:09.777
You see my difficulty.

01:29:12.802 --> 01:29:16.198
- I'll kill you.
- And ruin her?

01:29:25.939 --> 01:29:28.649
It would be a mistake
to kill me. Would it not?

01:29:28.692 --> 01:29:32.672
It could be a mistake to kill you now.

01:29:32.673 --> 01:29:34.774
Better kill yourself.

01:29:34.775 --> 01:29:40.024
Far better. She must love you.

01:29:41.434 --> 01:29:44.404
She must love you indeed.

01:29:44.673 --> 01:29:47.826
Troy, you've got to make her your wife.

01:29:47.913 --> 01:29:49.833
Fanny or Bathsheba?

01:29:49.958 --> 01:29:54.050
- I want to be quite sure I do what...
- Bathsheba. And I will help.

01:29:54.051 --> 01:29:56.821
You shall have the same money as before.

01:29:56.822 --> 01:29:58.980
Anything you need.

01:29:59.502 --> 01:30:02.062
As long as you do what is right.

01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:08.316
She has a right to
approve of the arrangement...

01:30:08.317 --> 01:30:10.189
...don't you agree?

01:30:38.552 --> 01:30:40.919
Oh, Mr. Boldwood?

01:30:41.457 --> 01:30:50.565
Fifty pounds not to marry
Fanny, 50 pounds to marry Bathsheba.

01:30:41.768 --> 01:30:46.901
Now, what was the arrangement?

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.800
Only one snag, really.

01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:55.031
Do you know what that is, Mr. Boldwood?

01:30:55.219 --> 01:30:58.780
We were married this morning.

01:33:54.553 --> 01:33:56.942
Thank you, darling.

01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:32.690
- Evening, Gabriel.
- Evening, thank you.

01:37:33.136 --> 01:37:37.103
- Evening.
- Good evening.

01:39:26.005 --> 01:39:27.973
- They really have had quite enough...
- I'll tell you what we'll do, friends.

01:39:28.715 --> 01:39:32.790
We'll send the women home
to warm the beds.

01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:38.785
And we men will stay and have a
carouse to ourselves. What do you say?

01:39:40.369 --> 01:39:44.510
But let any man show a white feather, and
he can look elsewhere for a winter's work.

01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:47.015
It'll only do them harm...

01:39:47.021 --> 01:39:49.984
- You want a song?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:51.492 --> 01:39:53.440
"Jolly Tinker."

01:39:56.073 --> 01:39:58.158
Half an hour.

01:43:34.853 --> 01:43:38.607
Gabriel! Is my husband up there?

01:43:38.714 --> 01:43:40.644
He's still in the barn, ma'am.

01:43:40.645 --> 01:43:42.133
What can I do?

01:43:42.134 --> 01:43:46.491
Tie these ropes to the
saddles, ma'am. If you can.

01:44:01.443 --> 01:44:04.708
Hold on, Gabriel! Hold on!

01:44:21.206 --> 01:44:23.291
Can you take the weight, ma'am?

01:45:16.387 --> 01:45:18.433
Gabriel!

01:45:18.434 --> 01:45:20.247
You must understand.

01:45:20.248 --> 01:45:26.271
Listen, when I went to Budsmouth I
meant to give up Mr. Troy. I really did.

01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:27.858
It doesn't matter.

01:45:27.859 --> 01:45:30.870
I didn't mean to hurt
anybody or betray myself.

01:45:31.307 --> 01:45:34.028
What's done is done.

01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:54.970
- Thank you, Gabriel. Thank you a thousand
- Go in, woman. Go in.

01:49:05.691 --> 01:49:08.856
Half an hour? Half an hour, indeed.

01:49:09.835 --> 01:49:15.116
I told you half an hour.
I've been worried sick all night.

01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:50.893
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:50:07.855 --> 01:50:09.758
Hello, my beauty.

01:50:28.069 --> 01:50:32.202
I'm sorry. Mrs. Troy.

01:50:34.043 --> 01:50:35.873
Now, come.

01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:15.230
- Have you seen Mr. Boldwood?
- I ain't seen him, no.

01:51:38.183 --> 01:51:40.226
Good morning, sir.

01:51:41.053 --> 01:51:42.978
Good morning, Oak.

01:51:43.139 --> 01:51:45.643
How are you, sir?

01:51:45.644 --> 01:51:48.960
Well. Very well.

01:51:53.358 --> 01:51:55.885
It's a terrible sight, sir.

01:51:55.886 --> 01:52:00.197
Possibly. Whatever
happened, it's my fault.

01:52:00.199 --> 01:52:05.044
I don't believe I shall
save a tenth of my corn this year.

01:52:06.713 --> 01:52:11.450
Oak, I’ve been a weak and foolish man.

01:52:13.199 --> 01:52:15.346
I don't know what I can do.

01:52:16.494 --> 01:52:19.577
It's this miserable grief.

01:52:21.127 --> 01:52:25.567
I had some faint
belief in the mercy of God...

01:52:25.568 --> 01:52:28.306
...before I lost that woman.

01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:32.951
I know they will
laugh about me in the parish.

01:52:34.224 --> 01:52:37.236
- I don't think so, sir.
- I think so, Oak.

01:52:39.426 --> 01:52:43.399
However, no woman's
had power over me for long.

01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:47.119
We were never really engaged.

01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:53.094
I wasn't jilted,
whatever they say, was I?

01:52:55.170 --> 01:52:57.546
I won't give up.

01:52:58.951 --> 01:53:02.025
I wasn't jilted.

01:53:02.564 --> 01:53:05.055
She never promised.

01:53:28.931 --> 01:53:31.385
-  I'll need 2 guineas on the white.
- Make it 4.

01:53:31.386 --> 01:53:33.844
- Okay, I'll raise you 2.
- I'll take it.

01:53:38.984 --> 01:53:41.571
Not dodging the issue, are you, Troy?

01:53:41.579 --> 01:53:45.338
- I'm not the one for that, Your Lordship.
- Still 50 guineas, then?

01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:48.531
Fifty guineas? Hardly worth my coming.

01:53:51.363 --> 01:53:56.937
- Make it a hundred.
- And 20? If you've got it to lose.

01:54:26.431 --> 01:54:29.142
Come on, my beauty.

01:55:54.505 --> 01:55:56.546
Frank.

01:55:58.156 --> 01:56:00.389
Frank.

01:56:05.674 --> 01:56:07.758
Fanny?

01:56:08.924 --> 01:56:10.717
My God, what are you doing here?

01:56:10.872 --> 01:56:13.011
I wouldn't have come...

01:56:13.225 --> 01:56:14.861
...but I need help.

01:56:14.862 --> 01:56:19.033
Where have you been?
What's happened to you?

01:56:21.979 --> 01:56:25.968
- Why didn't you write to me?
- I feared to.

01:56:27.855 --> 01:56:31.037
- Is that you, master?
- Yes. Yes.

01:56:33.793 --> 01:56:37.193
Shall I be getting the
boy to give him a rubdown, sir?

01:56:37.194 --> 01:56:38.237
Um, in a moment. In a moment.

01:56:43.967 --> 01:56:46.296
- You can't stay here.
- I know, I know.

01:56:46.303 --> 01:56:50.389
I had to see you, Frank.
I am going. I'm going, Frank.

01:56:50.404 --> 01:56:52.426
- Where?
- Casterbridge.

01:56:52.427 --> 01:56:54.438
- Where will you stay?
- The workhouse.

01:56:54.439 --> 01:56:57.299
You can't stay there.

01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:05.796
Well, perhaps for tonight.
And tomorrow I'll come for you.

01:57:05.797 --> 01:57:08.368
I'll bring all the
money I can lay my hands on.

01:57:08.410 --> 01:57:11.330
We'll find you some proper lodgings.

01:57:22.836 --> 01:57:27.318
Eleven o'clock at the Corn
Exchange. I'll meet you there.

01:58:27.046 --> 01:58:29.492
Could you let me have 20 pounds?

01:58:30.393 --> 01:58:31.674
What for?

01:58:31.685 --> 01:58:37.809
There's another fight tomorrow and if I
could raise some cash, I can win back what I lost.

01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:41.361
It's not the money I
care about, it's just...

01:58:41.362 --> 01:58:42.404
Good.

01:58:44.078 --> 01:58:46.097
I don't want you to go.

01:58:47.349 --> 01:58:50.162
Oh, Frank, please?

01:58:51.079 --> 01:58:53.137
Don't.

01:58:56.374 --> 01:58:59.143
It's only a few weeks ago
you said I was...

01:58:59.144 --> 01:59:02.930
...sweeter to you than all your
other pleasures put together.

01:59:04.016 --> 01:59:06.569
I am your wife.

01:59:15.921 --> 01:59:18.268
Frank, what's the money really for?

01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:22.605
All this grumbling over a little money.

01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:27.709
I think I have the right to
grumble a little if I'm the one who pays.

01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:32.027
Well, you've had your little
grumble, so now suppose you pay.

01:59:36.264 --> 01:59:41.176
Bathsheba, give me the
money or you'll be sorry.

01:59:41.177 --> 01:59:43.542
I'm sorry already.

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:45.996
Sorry about what?

01:59:47.487 --> 01:59:50.258
My romance has come to an end.

01:59:52.625 --> 01:59:55.493
All romances end at marriage.

01:59:56.252 --> 02:00:02.081
I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You
grieve me to the soul by being smart at my expense.

02:00:02.131 --> 02:00:04.059
Well, you're dull enough at mine.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.206
When I married you, your
life was dearer to me than my own.

02:00:08.384 --> 02:00:11.690
Frank, I would've died for you.

02:00:11.691 --> 02:00:15.843
Well, if you repent of marrying, so do I.

02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:21.864
I only repent if you don't love me
more than any other woman in the world.

02:00:22.221 --> 02:00:24.785
Not otherwise, Frank.

02:00:30.771 --> 02:00:33.626
Don't be so desperate.

02:00:34.602 --> 02:00:37.141
Don't be so desperate.

02:00:41.627 --> 02:00:43.503
Frank?

02:00:46.735 --> 02:00:49.665
That girl you were with, who was she?

02:00:53.003 --> 02:00:55.256
No one.

02:00:55.191 --> 02:00:59.549
No one.

02:03:23.232 --> 02:03:26.699
Come on in, Joseph. What's the hurry?

02:03:27.443 --> 02:03:30.933
The poor woman's dead. Nothing
will bring her back to life again.

02:03:34.224 --> 02:03:38.385
- Come on, Joseph.
- All right, Matthew.

02:03:57.125 --> 02:04:00.776
I can only stay a
minute. I got to be in before...

02:04:38.106 --> 02:04:39.909
Joseph.

02:04:39.982 --> 02:04:41.828
Joseph.

02:04:41.934 --> 02:04:46.619
- What time is it?
- It's past 5. The parson's gone home.

02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:48.869
We shall have to
bury her in the morning.

02:04:49.338 --> 02:04:57.438
Well, I got a slight attack of the
multiplying eye. I got a bit held up.

02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.576
Mistress says to take her up to the
house. She can lie there till morning.

02:05:06.039 --> 02:05:10.588
After all, that's where she came from.

02:05:19.715 --> 02:05:21.791
Move over, Joseph.

02:05:25.244 --> 02:05:26.868
Come on, now. Up.

02:05:47.347 --> 02:05:50.079
I'll sit up for
master if you like, miss.

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.004
I'm not at all afraid of
Fanny if I may sit in me own room.

02:05:54.237 --> 02:05:57.766
It's all right, Liddy.
I'm all right, you go to bed.

02:05:58.162 --> 02:06:00.831
Very well, miss.

02:06:07.788 --> 02:06:10.214
-Liddy?
- Miss?

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:14.906
Fanny passed through
Weatherbury yesterday, didn't she?

02:06:17.287 --> 02:06:20.381
I believe she did, miss, yes.

02:06:34.916 --> 02:06:36.585
What did she die of?

02:06:39.322 --> 02:06:43.329
What I heard, miss, was a...
A wicked story, l...

02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:47.152
I can't believe it,
so I wouldn't repeat it.

02:06:50.407 --> 02:06:52.661
Her sweetheart was a soldier, wasn't he?

02:06:52.662 --> 02:06:55.958
That's right, miss.
In Mr. Troy's regiment.

02:07:00.098 --> 02:07:02.393
- Go to bed now.
- No, I'll stay with you.

02:07:02.417 --> 02:07:03.987
Go to bed, please.

02:07:04.403 --> 02:07:06.489
Please.

02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:10.715
Miss.

02:07:28.338 --> 02:07:32.309
It was someone in his
regiment. That's what I always said.

02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:34.943
I always said that.

02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:52.549
More women than he knew
what to do with. Fanny Robin.

02:08:07.899 --> 02:08:11.720
Leaving her in that condition.

02:08:13.190 --> 02:08:16.629
- Oh, it's not true.
- True, right enough.

02:10:08.201 --> 02:10:10.744
Oh, God help me. Oh.

02:11:03.256 --> 02:11:05.002
Who is it?

02:11:06.046 --> 02:11:08.484
I must go. I must go.

02:11:08.878 --> 02:11:10.963
I must go.

02:11:12.007 --> 02:11:15.192
- I must go, I must...
- I want you to stay.

02:11:58.630 --> 02:12:01.314
Oh, don't, don't, don't.

02:12:04.131 --> 02:12:06.219
Don't, don't.

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:11.289
I love you better than she
did. Kiss me. Kiss me, kiss me.

02:12:11.811 --> 02:12:14.898
You will kiss me. I'm your wife.

02:12:18.588 --> 02:12:22.974
In the sight of
heaven you are my very wife.

02:12:22.975 --> 02:12:25.682
My darling Fan.

02:12:28.889 --> 02:12:31.209
I'm your wife.

02:12:32.045 --> 02:12:35.691
I'm not morally yours.

02:12:43.202 --> 02:12:46.738
This woman is more
to me, dead as she is...

02:12:46.739 --> 02:12:50.352
...than you ever were.

02:12:50.386 --> 02:12:52.187
Or are.

02:12:52.275 --> 02:12:55.130
Or could be.

02:13:46.707 --> 02:13:48.827
Almighty God that give us grace...

02:13:48.828 --> 02:13:51.613
Almighty God that give us grace...

02:13:52.083 --> 02:13:54.322
Almighty God that give us grace...

02:13:54.323 --> 02:13:57.279
Almighty God that give us
grace, that we may cast away the works...

02:14:03.622 --> 02:14:08.606
Almighty God that give us
grace, that we may cast away the works...

02:14:10.033 --> 02:14:12.632
Almighty God that give us
grace, that we may cast away the works...

02:14:12.633 --> 02:14:18.327
...that we may cast
away the works of darkness...

02:14:19.337 --> 02:14:22.589
Almighty God that give us grace...

02:14:22.551 --> 02:14:29.283
...that we may cast away the works of
darkness and on us put the armor of light.

02:14:31.801 --> 02:14:33.241
Miss!

02:14:33.650 --> 02:14:37.305
- Liddy.
- Oh, miss, come in, do.

02:14:40.043 --> 02:14:45.145
You must come in. Look at you. Look.

02:14:45.146 --> 02:14:48.096
- Oh, Liddy.
- You'll catch your death.

02:14:48.097 --> 02:14:50.129
No, no, I can't.

02:14:51.279 --> 02:14:53.325
He's gone.

02:14:54.308 --> 02:14:56.021
He has?

02:14:57.392 --> 02:14:59.165
Come on, come on.

02:14:59.487 --> 02:15:01.842
Oh, no, no, I can't go home yet.

02:15:01.843 --> 02:15:04.839
I must think.

02:18:48.068 --> 02:18:51.680
This ain't never worth 3
shillings, you know very well it ain't.

02:18:51.681 --> 02:18:55.702
- Got a nose to it.
- Nose, don't be damn good...

02:18:55.704 --> 02:19:00.286
- Been in the rick for two years.
- 2 years? That's a bit of this year's corn.

02:19:00.287 --> 02:19:01.931
- That's a fair price.
- Not bad at all.

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:04.947
- I'll give you 50.
- How many sacks do you want?

02:19:04.948 --> 02:19:07.592
- How many you got there?
- I've got 56 left.

02:19:07.593 --> 02:19:11.808
- 44 for the quart.
- 43.

02:19:11.809 --> 02:19:15.403
- I be looking for Mrs. Troy. Is that she?
- Yes, that's Mrs. Troy over there. Yes.

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:22.407
- Mrs. Troy?
- Yes.

02:19:22.409 --> 02:19:26.159
I have some pretty bad news for you.
I'm afraid your husband's been drowned.

02:19:27.517 --> 02:19:29.909
He washed out to sea.

02:19:35.749 --> 02:19:38.512
- What's happened?
- Her husband's been drowned.

02:19:41.155 --> 02:19:42.902
Coast Guard found his clothes
and brought them into Budsmouth.

02:20:07.512 --> 02:20:09.017
Get some water.

02:20:20.176 --> 02:20:22.391
I want to go.

02:20:26.876 --> 02:20:29.522
I want to go home.

02:20:44.613 --> 02:20:46.774
- Morning, Mrs. Troy.
- Morning.

02:20:46.775 --> 02:20:49.703
Morning, Mr. Oak.

02:21:04.406 --> 02:21:05.735
Gabriel.

02:21:14.598 --> 02:21:16.213
Jan?

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.545
- How are you?
- Oh, pretty tidy, sir. Thank you.

02:21:23.006 --> 02:21:25.126
- Good morning.
- Ten and six.

02:21:26.156 --> 02:21:27.920
Henery?

02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:31.091
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Oak. Thank you.

02:21:34.272 --> 02:21:35.901
Cainy.

02:22:26.473 --> 02:22:31.928
In six years, you'll be free to remarry.
Even if nothing more is heard of him.

02:22:32.246 --> 02:22:34.883
I'm willing to wait that long.

02:22:36.359 --> 02:22:38.512
More than willing.

02:22:39.210 --> 02:22:41.372
If you are willing...

02:22:43.042 --> 02:22:46.616
...to promise that in six
years, if you are still alone...

02:22:46.617 --> 02:22:48.242
We may all be dead.

02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:51.465
- Six years!
- But if we are not.

02:22:53.134 --> 02:22:55.195
Mr. Boldwood, I will say this.

02:22:55.196 --> 02:22:59.216
I will never marry another man
whilst you wish me to be your wife.

02:22:59.218 --> 02:23:01.356
I cannot say more.

02:23:01.357 --> 02:23:05.495
Promise me, that in
six years, you'll be my wife.

02:23:06.696 --> 02:23:09.652
If I can give you
happiness by a mere promise...

02:23:09.759 --> 02:23:13.168
...not to get married before six
years, should my husband not return...

02:23:13.169 --> 02:23:14.524
Promise.

02:23:16.192 --> 02:23:18.337
It is a great honor to me and I cannot...

02:23:18.338 --> 02:23:19.380
Promise.

02:23:19.934 --> 02:23:22.003
- ...consider...
- Promise.

02:23:23.256 --> 02:23:25.424
I cannot yet promise.

02:23:26.988 --> 02:23:30.987
If not yet...then when?

02:23:30.988 --> 02:23:33.115
Soon.

02:23:36.872 --> 02:23:39.381
Christmas.

02:23:39.847 --> 02:23:41.876
Christmas.

02:23:42.476 --> 02:23:45.263
Christmas.

02:24:08.971 --> 02:24:11.612
Come for Captain Fortesque's
famous circus and menagerie.

02:24:11.613 --> 02:24:14.254
This way, ladies and gentlemen.

02:24:14.255 --> 02:24:18.552
One penny admission or 2 pennies
for a cushion filled with straw.

02:24:21.350 --> 02:24:28.704
For 1 penny, ladies and gentlemen
you can see Captain Fortesque...

02:24:28.705 --> 02:24:39.686
Animals imported from the Far
East for your special entertainment.

02:24:51.283 --> 02:24:55.864
Come and see Captain
Fortesque as the infamous Dick Turpin,

02:24:55.865 --> 02:25:00.448
on his famous pony, Black Bess.

02:25:05.642 --> 02:25:07.728
Draw up, ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to commence.

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:15.686
-How do you do? Pleased to meet you.
- Evening, Mrs. Troy.

02:25:15.687 --> 02:25:18.478
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Troy.
- How do you do?

02:25:21.084 --> 02:25:24.232
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, thank you. Very much.

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:28.623
You all right, mate?

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:34.028
- I can't go on.
- Don't be ridiculous.

02:25:34.029 --> 02:25:35.611
I've lost my voice.

02:25:35.612 --> 02:25:38.085
You were singing
your head off a minute ago.

02:25:38.086 --> 02:25:41.280
- That's how it went.
- They'll tear the place apart.

02:25:41.281 --> 02:25:42.949
There's 50 pound in there.

02:25:45.804 --> 02:25:51.473
To tell you the truth, there's a
man out there I owe money to.

02:25:51.474 --> 02:25:56.208
You've dodged creditors before. Brush up
your mustache and thicken your voice.

02:25:56.209 --> 02:25:58.814
It's a risk you'll damn
well have to take, captain.

02:25:58.815 --> 02:26:03.012
Captain Fortesque
and his pony, Black Bess.

02:26:03.013 --> 02:26:07.159
Draw up, ladies and gentlemen.
The show is about to commence.

02:26:07.196 --> 02:26:09.473
Afternoon, sergeant.

02:26:09.474 --> 02:26:11.912
Not drowned, then, I see.

02:26:11.913 --> 02:26:15.911
Story is, you was drowned.

02:26:15.912 --> 02:26:17.452
The story was wrong, wasn't it?

02:26:17.453 --> 02:26:22.481
- Had a bit of luck. Got picked up.
- You always was lucky, eh, sergeant?

02:26:22.482 --> 02:26:24.030
What are you doing here?

02:26:24.031 --> 02:26:26.664
Oh, I thought we might
do a bit of business together.

02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:29.458
Just get out, will you?

02:26:29.459 --> 02:26:31.824
If you like, sergeant.

02:26:34.558 --> 02:26:38.379
I'm sure Mrs. Troy will
be relieved to hear the news.

02:26:38.699 --> 02:26:40.456
The show is about to commence.

02:26:56.802 --> 02:27:01.660
Stand and deliver!
Your money or your life!

02:27:01.661 --> 02:27:04.756
Come on out. It'll
be the better for you.

02:27:04.757 --> 02:27:08.650
Don't shoot. Don't shoot,
please, sir. Oh, my goodness.

02:27:45.146 --> 02:27:49.096
This should take some
weight off his shoulders.

02:27:49.097 --> 02:27:55.240
Oh, my good woman. I'll wager
she could spare a pound or two.

02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:58.121
Oh, me pies.

02:29:21.417 --> 02:29:23.190
Aha!

02:29:23.932 --> 02:29:29.266
- Here's the groom. Look after her well.
- That's Mr. Pennyways.

02:29:29.267 --> 02:29:30.727
Keep your mouth shut.

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:34.417
Tell no one you recognize me, and
you'll not lack your proper reward.

02:29:34.547 --> 02:29:41.013
But speak to those you shouldn't
and you won't live to tell the tale.

02:30:20.236 --> 02:30:22.820
Thrust. Thrust.

02:30:46.497 --> 02:30:51.576
When the spires of York
Minster Now burst on my view...

02:30:51.577 --> 02:30:55.043
And the chimes they were ringing a knell

02:30:55.044 --> 02:31:00.758
Halt. Halt, my brave mare

02:31:00.759 --> 02:31:02.992
They no longer pursue

02:31:02.993 --> 02:31:06.783
As she halted, She staggered

02:31:08.762 --> 02:31:10.535
She fell

02:31:15.301 --> 02:31:18.664
Her breathings are over

02:31:18.665 --> 02:31:22.354
All hushed to her grave

02:31:22.355 --> 02:31:27.327
My bonny Black Bess,
Once my pride

02:31:27.328 --> 02:31:31.556
Now her poor heart has burst

02:31:31.779 --> 02:31:34.616
Her rider to save

02:31:34.532 --> 02:31:38.811
For Dick Turpin she lived

02:31:39.751 --> 02:31:43.067
And she died

02:32:06.063 --> 02:32:07.788
There.

02:32:07.992 --> 02:32:10.909
- Have you enough chairs?
- Plenty.

02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:12.481
- Place them along the wall.
- Good.

02:32:13.658 --> 02:32:17.926
- Gunning, there's no holly with berries.
- Yes, sir.

02:32:19.489 --> 02:32:23.413
- Now, you have enough of everything?
- I'm not sure, sir.

02:32:23.414 --> 02:32:26.245
Not sure? If you're not sure, ask.
Understand? There must be no mistakes.

02:32:26.246 --> 02:32:29.077
If you need anything,
send into Casterbridge.

02:32:29.078 --> 02:32:31.521
This has got to be a great occasion.

02:32:31.522 --> 02:32:34.033
This house hasn't seen a
party like this since I was a boy.

02:32:34.069 --> 02:32:35.536
I know that, sir.

02:32:35.537 --> 02:32:37.796
- Since I was a boy.
- Yes, sir.

02:32:39.465 --> 02:32:43.607
Is there any new knot
in fashion, do you know?

02:32:43.608 --> 02:32:46.361
I don't know that, sir.

02:32:48.876 --> 02:32:51.583
Plates, please. Over here.

02:33:42.548 --> 02:33:45.745
"They shall take other stones
and put them in the place of those...

02:33:45.746 --> 02:33:48.243
...and he shall take
mortar and plaster the house."

02:33:48.244 --> 02:33:50.187
That's no good.

02:33:52.505 --> 02:33:54.674
"Enter ye in at the
straight gate, for wide is the gate...

02:33:54.675 --> 02:33:57.086
...and broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction...

02:33:57.816 --> 02:34:00.953
...and many there
be which go in thereat."

02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:05.646
I don't know what to do.

02:34:05.647 --> 02:34:08.460
I just don't know what to do.

02:34:08.808 --> 02:34:13.332
I really believe that if I don't give
him my word, he'll go out of his mind.

02:34:13.333 --> 02:34:17.039
Gabriel, I believe I hold
his entire future in my hands.

02:34:18.407 --> 02:34:21.117
I tremble at responsibility.

02:34:21.118 --> 02:34:23.820
I hope nothing so
dreadful hangs on it as you fancy.

02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:27.684
Perhaps you should give him the
conditional promise that he wants.

02:34:27.685 --> 02:34:29.946
- I think I would.
- But is it right?

02:34:29.947 --> 02:34:32.046
Is it right, Gabriel?

02:34:32.336 --> 02:34:38.189
The only sin, to my mind lies in thinking
of ever marrying a man you don't love.

02:34:38.188 --> 02:34:40.623
You may suppose that love is wanting.

02:34:40.624 --> 02:34:44.296
Love is an utterly
sorry, worn out, bygone thing.

02:34:44.297 --> 02:34:46.236
For him or anyone else.

02:34:46.951 --> 02:34:50.679
Sorry, ma'am, I'm obviously
not the right person to advise.

02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:22.286
Good evening, Mr. Boldwood.

02:35:22.287 --> 02:35:24.377
Good evening.

02:35:28.653 --> 02:35:31.574
- Have you everything you need, ladies?
- Yes, thank you.

02:35:34.862 --> 02:35:36.947
Good evening.

02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:42.442
- There's a supper table downstairs.
- Thank you so much. You're very kind.

02:35:45.802 --> 02:35:47.960
Enjoy yourselves.

02:35:52.043 --> 02:35:54.170
- Good evening, Mr. Boldwood.
- Good evening.

02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:07.135
Good evening, Mr. Boldwood, sir.

02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:09.635
Coggan. Fray.

02:36:10.492 --> 02:36:13.905
Don't feel you have to stay
down here. There's dancing here.

02:36:13.906 --> 02:36:17.319
Food. Help yourselves.

02:36:18.154 --> 02:36:22.467
- I want you all to enjoy yourselves.
- That's very kind of you.

02:36:37.891 --> 02:36:40.833
- So you've come.
- Oh, yes, of course. I said I would.

02:36:40.834 --> 02:36:42.479
Yes, you said.

02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:49.525
- I must speak to you.
- Please, no. Not yet, please.

02:36:49.565 --> 02:36:53.734
- I must. Now.
- Please, I do beg of you, please.

02:36:55.715 --> 02:36:58.204
Oh, good evening, Mr. Boldwood.

02:36:58.205 --> 02:37:01.783
Oh, may I have the
pleasure of presenting Dr. And Mrs...

02:37:01.784 --> 02:37:04.556
- Braybrook. Mrs. Troy.
- This is my daughter, Janet.

02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:08.240
Splendid party.

02:37:19.599 --> 02:37:21.343
Well, what do you say?

02:37:22.012 --> 02:37:24.008
Your promise, do you give it?

02:37:25.332 --> 02:37:31.154
Mr. Boldwood, I'm not the
same as I was when...before...

02:37:31.526 --> 02:37:33.522
You're still a very beautiful woman.

02:37:35.087 --> 02:37:38.367
I ask only for the
privilege of looking after you.

02:37:41.970 --> 02:37:44.988
If I say yes,
you'll not press me anymore?

02:37:44.989 --> 02:37:47.207
No.

02:37:48.667 --> 02:37:50.799
Very well.

02:37:52.639 --> 02:37:56.932
In six years, if my
husband has not returned...

02:37:58.811 --> 02:38:00.815
...I will be your wife.

02:38:08.636 --> 02:38:10.244
Oh, no, I cannot wear a ring.

02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.836
As a token...of a present
engagement, with a marriage at the end.

02:38:15.914 --> 02:38:19.685
No. Besides I would not
want anyone to know about...

02:38:19.686 --> 02:38:21.737
Wear it tonight.

02:38:22.258 --> 02:38:27.008
Just for tonight. Please?

02:39:52.406 --> 02:39:54.454
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:39:54.844 --> 02:39:57.376
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:39:57.377 --> 02:40:00.556
I wish to propose a toast.

02:40:01.598 --> 02:40:03.593
I want you to charge your glasses.

02:40:03.738 --> 02:40:05.276
Gunning.

02:40:05.277 --> 02:40:09.245
And when you have, I want you
to drink with me...to the lady who...

02:40:09.247 --> 02:40:12.141
Is Mrs. Troy here?

02:40:33.333 --> 02:40:35.276
Bathsheba.

02:40:35.902 --> 02:40:37.990
I come here for you.

02:40:39.969 --> 02:40:42.334
I've come to take you home.

02:40:45.495 --> 02:40:47.293
Come, madam.

02:40:48.754 --> 02:40:50.873
Do you hear me?

02:40:55.154 --> 02:40:57.257
Come.

02:41:03.531 --> 02:41:07.670
Frank! Frank!

02:41:10.797 --> 02:41:12.682
Frank.

02:41:24.438 --> 02:41:26.113
There's nothing I can do, Mrs. Troy.

02:41:28.504 --> 02:41:31.176
Frank. Frank.

02:41:38.796 --> 02:41:40.969
Frank.

02:41:44.771 --> 02:41:46.983
Frank! Frank!

02:41:57.299 --> 02:42:01.457
Frank. Frank. Frank.

02:43:00.628 --> 02:43:02.284
Come on.

02:43:17.717 --> 02:43:19.464
Come on. Hurry. We're late.

02:43:27.796 --> 02:43:30.207
Good afternoon, Mrs. Troy.

02:44:07.363 --> 02:44:10.817
Eight months.
Seems like yesterday to me.

02:44:11.549 --> 02:44:14.892
It seems years ago to me. Long years.

02:44:16.667 --> 02:44:20.480
And I've been dead between.

02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:25.078
Are you in the choir now, Gabriel?

02:44:25.445 --> 02:44:27.225
For quite a time now.

02:44:35.143 --> 02:44:38.085
- Mrs. Troy?
- Yes.

02:44:38.554 --> 02:44:41.996
- I've been hoping to have a word.
- What?

02:44:41.997 --> 02:44:45.307
The fact is, I'm
thinking of leaving England.

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:49.685
- Leaving England?
- I don't see much of a future here.

02:44:51.468 --> 02:44:53.737
California's the spot I had in mind.

02:44:54.492 --> 02:44:58.030
But I thought you were to have
Mr. Boldwood's place. I heard it...

02:44:58.031 --> 02:45:00.743
I had the offer, but I decided not.

02:45:00.744 --> 02:45:05.512
That's why I thought it
fair to give you clear notice.

02:45:07.005 --> 02:45:08.708
Oh, I see.

02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:11.782
Why, I'd hoped that if
you leased Mr. Boldwood's...

02:45:11.783 --> 02:45:14.420
...you might still give a
helping look across at mine.

02:45:14.421 --> 02:45:16.940
I would have, willingly.

02:45:16.941 --> 02:45:20.194
Now that I'm at my most
helpless, you're going away.

02:45:21.193 --> 02:45:23.601
Yes. That's the misfortune of it all.

02:45:23.848 --> 02:45:28.357
And it's because of that very
helplessness that I feel bound to go.

02:45:30.652 --> 02:45:32.291
I see.

02:45:35.031 --> 02:45:37.755
Yes, ma'am.

02:45:37.756 --> 02:45:39.668
Well...

02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:46.468
Good afternoon, ma'am.

02:47:23.835 --> 02:47:25.988
Oh, Gabriel.

02:47:28.492 --> 02:47:31.296
You're not really going, are you?

02:47:32.646 --> 02:47:36.417
Well, I will stay on one
condition, and on one condition only.

02:47:37.565 --> 02:47:39.939
- Well?
- This one.

02:47:40.412 --> 02:47:43.630
That whenever I
look up, there you will be.

02:47:44.236 --> 02:47:48.483
And whenever you
look up there shall I be.

02:48:17.612 --> 02:48:19.206
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

02:48:19.461 --> 02:48:21.511
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

02:48:22.417 --> 02:48:23.597
Thank you.

02:48:27.215 --> 02:48:29.138
- Good night.
- Good night.
