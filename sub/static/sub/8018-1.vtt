00:18.000 --> 00:24.330
72 hours later, he had received
more than a hundred videos from the same creature.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.747
What a cold!

00:38.080 --> 00:40.872
What the heck is that?

00:45.122 --> 00:48.289
Wait! I do not see anything!

00:49.454 --> 00:52.912
- Hell!
- Where did that voice come from?

00:53.662 --> 00:59.120
- What was it? Do not play games with me now.
- Shivering death.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.620
Where are we?

01:02.371 --> 01:07.120
Here we go! Run!

01:08.287 --> 01:10.287
- What was it?
- Stop...

01:11.037 --> 01:12.995
Wait! I can not!

01:16.620 --> 01:22.162
The video became one of the most frightening legends
invisible online.

01:30.994 --> 01:37.826
A year ago Laqha-Warmi got 8 hours
uncut material creature.

01:49.118 --> 01:53.576
Now would be able to tell the story.

01:59.159 --> 02:02.075
Our Father, hallowed be thy nimesi-

02:02.825 --> 02:06.533
Your kingdom come and your will be done
both on earth as in heaven.

02:07.284 --> 02:10.283
Give us our daily bread, and let us
debt forgiveness

02:10.532 --> 02:13.174
As we give them,
who trespass against us.

02:13.409 --> 02:17.783
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

02:18.533 --> 02:22.450
Hell! What is that?

02:25.658 --> 02:28.074
Where am I?

02:31.158 --> 02:38.449
God, save me. Hear my prayer.
I can not...

02:39.948 --> 02:44.282
Say what you want! What do you want?

02:45.448 --> 02:47.781
No, no, please.

02:51.697 --> 02:53.614
Stop!

02:59.115 --> 03:05.282
Hell! No no! Please!

03:14.613 --> 03:17.696
This is the last moment of my life...

03:18.446 --> 03:25.695
If anyone finds this, this may not seem
parents. Tell them...

03:33.238 --> 03:35.113
Please!

03:47.611 --> 03:51.694
I would die for you, Ani!
How can you keep those shorts?

03:52.445 --> 03:56.903
How can I think of anything else?
What does she want?

03:57.653 --> 03:59.194
- Moron.
- Hello.

03:59.361 --> 04:01.111
- See teachers.
- Benjamin.

04:01.861 --> 04:06.069
- So?
- Tell the class what you said.

04:06.819 --> 04:11.194
I told Joshua,
that bothers me...

04:11.944 --> 04:13.693
He is a dreamer.

04:14.444 --> 04:19.860
That representaatiotavat
are important to the final work.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.235
Joshua, this is not a situation comedy.

04:22.984 --> 04:27.651
Put the camera away and think about something
creative and original.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.276
Okay. Original and creative.

04:31.776 --> 04:38.859
I love it when you do that, Ani.
Tell me something about yourself.

04:39.609 --> 04:44.401
Idiootit.com shows...
"Benjamin".

04:45.151 --> 04:51.151
- You clear on what you are shooting.
- I want to show you how stupid you are.

04:51.900 --> 04:57.316
There is nothing more stupid than you
walking hand in hand with Lucas.

04:58.066 --> 05:01.774
- Why are we friends with you?
- He's following us.

05:02.524 --> 05:05.316
See who comes.
A former girlfriend.

05:06.982 --> 05:10.982
- Have you begun to document the injury?
- Why were not you in class?

05:11.732 --> 05:15.107
I had to do.
Do you come up with the topic?

05:15.857 --> 05:21.732
- No, we describe only each other.
- Do you have a great idea?

05:22.481 --> 05:25.899
Have you heard the reaction from videos?

05:26.647 --> 05:29.106
- Yes, they are on the Internet.
- No.

05:29.856 --> 05:34.106
Describe the people who watch videos,
with torture or dying...

05:34.855 --> 05:37.106
And monitor the reaction.

05:37.855 --> 05:42.481
Therefore describe torture
and dying people. Sounds good.

05:43.231 --> 05:49.063
No, not that what they see,
only reactions.

05:49.813 --> 05:52.980
That's why the name is a reaction to the video.

05:53.730 --> 05:58.147
We can examine it and think about what they see.

05:58.897 --> 06:03.313
- It sounds complicated.
- It's a good idea.

06:04.062 --> 06:09.686
What do we do with you, Lucas?
All right, we do it.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.062
It sounds complicated, but the
interesting.

06:13.811 --> 06:16.770
- I can get the cameras.
- Really?

06:17.520 --> 06:21.479
- 3D cameras.
- Where'd you get them?

06:49.935 --> 06:53.851
- Are these the ones Carla?
- No, those are old.

06:54.726 --> 06:57.893
- Come here.
- This is the University of forbidden zone.

06:58.643 --> 07:02.435
- I have the key.
- It is strange.

07:03.185 --> 07:07.726
I'm not going to tell you how I got it.
We're here.

07:08.476 --> 07:13.101
All have been entered.
There are a lot of tools.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.725
Wait.

07:17.850 --> 07:20.058
That's not good.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.975
I found it.

07:23.725 --> 07:28.142
- I am not convinced.
- You've said it a thousand times.

07:28.892 --> 07:31.892
- We're just...
- Did you touch something, Benjamin?

07:32.641 --> 07:34.933
- I do anything.
- Benjamin.

07:35.682 --> 07:39.557
- Maybe it was Lucas.
- It was nothing.

07:42.057 --> 07:46.057
- We can still go back.
- Visit by it's here.

07:46.806 --> 07:50.890
- Where do we take the cameras?
- You will come to you, Joshua.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.140
Wait...

07:55.931 --> 07:59.765
This. They should be here.

08:05.265 --> 08:08.973
- Look at this beauty!
- What technology!

08:09.722 --> 08:13.056
Try it. We need two.

08:14.597 --> 08:19.930
- All right. Shall we go?
- Yes.

08:20.679 --> 08:26.389
This works very well.
Stay on it.

08:27.596 --> 08:30.596
- Nose scratch.
- Say hello to the teachers.

08:31.347 --> 08:34.721
- Hey, what's up?
- Good.

08:41.511 --> 08:46.138
We have to go. Hasten.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.888
- You do not agree with this?
- There is someone.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.428
What is that? Run!

08:57.178 --> 09:00.844
Why do not we describe
ordinary cameras?

09:12.927 --> 09:18.386
This camera is amazing! It brings up all your skin
errors, Lucas.

09:19.136 --> 09:24.427
- You look awful. Congratulations!
- Look at this. Does it work well?

09:25.177 --> 09:31.551
- Can you see it?
- Whether you're funny.

09:32.301 --> 09:36.010
- Look at me, I'm a funny sweater!
- Stop.

09:36.759 --> 09:40.426
Carla? Can we really leave
cameras here?

09:41.176 --> 09:46.176
They may be  here.
In addition, we need to start.

09:46.925 --> 09:52.426
I'm just a little hungry.
Would you get something to eat, Lucas?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.675
No, not yet.

09:54.717 --> 09:58.009
- Let's go to the place around the corner.
- It is not good.

09:58.759 --> 10:03.342
Let's see what you can find.
I will offer.

10:04.091 --> 10:05.633
Do not worry. I have money.

10:06.341 --> 10:09.715
Do you not see that he has a goal,
but you're on the road?

10:10.465 --> 10:13.798
- We're going to eat, then.
- In this condition a friend!

10:14.548 --> 10:18.216
We're going to eat.
Do you want something?

10:18.966 --> 10:23.757
- No. Do you want?
- We'll be back in half an hour.

10:24.507 --> 10:27.132
Is there enough time for you?

10:27.882 --> 10:35.632
Very fun. Thank you very much.
Do not mind her.

10:40.672 --> 10:42.214
Look...

10:42.589 --> 10:44.881
- What do you do?
- What do you think?

10:45.631 --> 10:49.256
- I do not want to mess things up.
- What things?

10:50.006 --> 10:55.172
- This. We are working together.
- Come on, Joshua.

10:55.922 --> 11:00.838
Nothing happens. We keep just for fun.

11:01.963 --> 11:08.505
Calm down. Do not exaggerate.
Keep only the fun, right?

11:15.629 --> 11:19.504
Camera is turned on.

11:25.004 --> 11:28.212
- Enjoy now. I may provide you with any more.
- Stingy.

11:28.962 --> 11:35.544
Wasteful? I left Joshua's former
with his girlfriend, and I'm stingy?

11:36.295 --> 11:41.503
- Do you think they are doing that?
- What do you think? He is my friend.

11:42.254 --> 11:46.044
I taught him everything.
He does everything right.

11:46.793 --> 11:50.668
Would not you have been taught to be
not to mention the food in your mouth?

11:51.419 --> 11:56.210
I'm lazy. I prefer two things at a time
. Do you think he is ready?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.835
I do not know. Ask them.

11:59.877 --> 12:05.584
How could I go ask
"are you ready?"

12:06.335 --> 12:08.542
- I correctly you like me?
- You lost!

12:09.293 --> 12:11.210
- Joshua.
- Pelästyitte!

12:11.960 --> 12:15.877
- I managed.
- Yes, moron. You've managed.

12:16.626 --> 12:19.418
- Did you do it?
- Sneezes and you came?

12:20.167 --> 12:24.458
- Shut up. Now to work.
- How did you get the girl?

12:25.209 --> 12:29.166
You will not fail even to meet him.

12:30.916 --> 12:35.541
Consider Joshua.
Never leave your girlfriend alone in your room.

12:36.291 --> 12:40.833
- She's not my girlfriend.
- That's right. Worse.

12:41.583 --> 12:45.750
What if our research reaktiovideoita-

12:46.499 --> 12:49.458
Would film our own reactions?

12:50.208 --> 12:55.540
Are you kidding?
Can you think of that all by yourself? Congratulations!

12:56.290 --> 13:01.040
Look at this.
I planned everything.

13:01.789 --> 13:06.748
<i>- That considered it, then?
- I am quite upset.</i>

13:22.039 --> 13:25.831
- Are they Basis?
- Does it matter?

13:46.080 --> 13:50.662
<i>- What is that?
- What it is?</i>

13:52.204 --> 13:54.829
<i>- Put it off.
- Shut up.</i>

13:55.579 --> 13:57.871
<i>They take her...</i>

14:03.578 --> 14:07.203
<i>Stop. Stop it, please!</i>

14:11.953 --> 14:14.702
<i>What is it?</i>

14:17.953 --> 14:22.078
<i>Are you happy now, moron? Are you?</i>

14:23.660 --> 14:27.035
- What was it?
- It was very intense.

14:27.785 --> 14:31.577
- I know one of them.
- Really?

14:32.328 --> 14:36.827
Sergio.
I saw her last holiday.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.494
I have not seen him for a while,
but probably he still lives there.

14:42.243 --> 14:45.284
- You know where he lives.
- Jerk.

14:46.034 --> 14:50.076
Even when you're everything, Carla,
we may fail in terms of content.

14:50.826 --> 14:55.617
So, this is not enough.
We need to interview him.

14:56.368 --> 14:58.742
- Him?
- In order to know what they looked at.

14:59.492 --> 15:02.658
- Can we go now?
- His luokseenko?

15:05.201 --> 15:08.700
- Damn, I can not see anything.
- I think it's here.

15:09.451 --> 15:13.908
- What do you think?
- I've been here only in the evening.

15:14.657 --> 15:17.074
- Why am I not surprised?
- Are you suggesting something?

15:17.824 --> 15:21.616
- I'm suggesting anything. You tell it all.
- Be quiet!

15:22.366 --> 15:26.616
We're going, and you expect with the cameras.
Do not do anything stupid.

15:27.366 --> 15:31.490
Let's go...

15:32.241 --> 15:33.866
Even wiseacre...

15:34.615 --> 15:39.698
- Do not you understand what you are doing?
- I can handle it.

15:40.448 --> 15:43.781
Image here.
I do not think it harm?

15:44.531 --> 15:48.031
- Is anybody home?
- No one is going to open up.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.530
- Tap like a man!
- Shut up!

15:53.947 --> 15:58.114
Have you noticed
that Carla is longer than that, Joshua?

15:58.864 --> 16:02.655
He should not go lower than
rapulle.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.197
- See.
- Twice.

16:06.947 --> 16:09.114
Now someone will come.

16:10.571 --> 16:13.864
- He looks like you like your mother.
- And the show.

16:14.613 --> 16:18.864
- He has the same hairstyle.
- Do not look.

16:23.154 --> 16:29.653
He saw us. I forgot to turn off the light.
Stupid.

16:32.570 --> 16:36.404
- She began to scream.
- He'll call the police.

16:37.153 --> 16:40.778
Went wrong.
Now they are coming from.

16:42.737 --> 16:46.778
- There can not be true.
- Sergio is dead.

16:47.527 --> 16:50.987
- What do you mean dead?
- In the accident.

16:51.737 --> 16:53.486
Did he say more?

16:54.237 --> 16:58.694
Did not say. She laments.
Should I have to ask how the boy died?

16:59.444 --> 17:04.402
- All video are dead.
- All three?

17:05.152 --> 17:10.194
- All are dead.
-'ll Talk about it when we are at home.

17:10.943 --> 17:13.734
We will continue with other videos.
After all, other, Carla?

17:14.484 --> 17:17.859
- I do not want any more of this.
- Come on. Surely it is a story.

17:18.609 --> 17:21.193
- Think now.
- How can you think so?

17:21.943 --> 17:25.276
Listen, someone will come.
Someone's coming.

17:26.026 --> 17:28.651
- Who is this asshole is?
- Lock the doors.

17:29.401 --> 17:31.860
- Hey.
- I apologize to my mother.

17:32.608 --> 17:35.483
- He's not okay.
- He has certainly been heavy.

17:36.234 --> 17:37.774
It is still the case.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.524
- Are you journalists?
- No, the students.

17:42.275 --> 17:47.691
You came Sergio because of it.
I am in Santiago, his older brother.

17:48.441 --> 17:51.983
- Do you want to know what happened?
- If you convenience.

17:52.733 --> 17:56.275
- Can we talk somewhere?
- Come aboard.

17:57.816 --> 18:00.024
This is a bad idea.

18:05.898 --> 18:10.398
Are we going to really continue?
To investigate how they died?

18:11.148 --> 18:13.107
We had to examine the reaction of videos.

18:13.857 --> 18:18.982
- We're still on the same track.
- How it relates to their death?

18:19.731 --> 18:23.940
Now, think about Lucas. You're always like that.
He wants to talk.

18:25.023 --> 18:27.981
Three, two, one...

18:29.814 --> 18:34.398
I'm not in Lima, very often,
so this rarely Sergiota-

18:35.147 --> 18:41.647
But we got along well,
because we are half brothers. We were talking about.

18:42.397 --> 18:47.646
- His death touched me deeply.
- Did you talk with him before that?

18:48.396 --> 18:53.730
We talked about a couple of days before that.
He told me when cinefilms.

18:54.479 --> 18:57.938
Cinefilms, which he had found
cemetery with their friends.

18:58.687 --> 19:02.980
- Did he say more?
- Whence?

19:03.729 --> 19:07.396
For example, friends.

19:08.770 --> 19:13.104
Not much. I do not know...
We talked about everyday things.

19:13.854 --> 19:16.729
As such, the Internet is spoken.

19:18.686 --> 19:24.103
But he told the film.
It was made an impression on him.

19:27.853 --> 19:31.186
He said that it told of torture.

19:32.394 --> 19:35.769
Then he was weird.
He spoke of the curse.

19:36.518 --> 19:39.853
- From the curse?
- Yeah, I do not know.

19:40.602 --> 19:46.394
I think he had burned
and it was a little paranoid.

19:52.601 --> 19:55.726
Her neck was broken.

19:56.476 --> 20:02.809
When we went to get him with my mother,
we saw that his neck was broken.

20:04.267 --> 20:07.726
It was called an accident, but...

20:08.851 --> 20:12.726
His head was turned around.

20:13.726 --> 20:19.641
And... I saw how the backbone
worked their way out of the neck.

20:22.267 --> 20:28.808
But he can not of interest to you.
You wanted to talk about the film.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.932
Sergio said that it all started
cemetery. Next to the church.

20:37.682 --> 20:43.807
He had gone into a small room,
archive, with a couple of friends.

20:44.557 --> 20:50.974
There where will the papers of the deceased.
Where can leave them with stuff.

20:51.724 --> 20:54.765
They found the old cinefilms.

20:55.932 --> 20:58.099
Did you see it?

21:02.348 --> 21:07.680
How. My brother had a copy.
I had it saatavilla-

21:08.430 --> 21:10.431
But I found it completely.

21:11.930 --> 21:17.097
- Why did not you?
- I do not know. I put it off.

21:17.847 --> 21:24.097
I was afraid
that I should be like the Sergio.

21:28.305 --> 21:35.680
You like maybe I'm crazy,
but something changed.

21:37.553 --> 21:44.304
- It seems as if something would follow me.
- One? Which one?

21:49.720 --> 21:52.137
Devil.

22:02.970 --> 22:07.595
Santiago...
Can you take us to the cemetery?

22:12.385 --> 22:19.135
- We should not be here, Benja.
- What now? Are you afraid of?

22:22.718 --> 22:25.385
Take this.

22:27.759 --> 22:30.634
Okay.

22:32.468 --> 22:34.219
Now it's your turn.

22:46.217 --> 22:49.050
What a cold!

22:53.342 --> 22:57.008
- Where are we going, Benja?
- We monitor our friend.

22:57.758 --> 23:03.092
Do not say anything. We do not know him.
We do not do it.

23:05.217 --> 23:10.342
- Be careful, Lucas.
- You see where we are? This is huge.

23:11.092 --> 23:13.342
This is not the end.

23:15.007 --> 23:16.882
What are you doing,
if someone grabs you?

23:17.631 --> 23:22.756
- What do I do? Nothing.
- You're afraid.

23:23.506 --> 23:25.548
Do not you then?

23:34.589 --> 23:37.672
Walk faster.
Do not miss to cry.

23:38.422 --> 23:42.131
- Why would I cry?
- Yeah, why?

23:42.881 --> 23:45.173
Is there still a long way to go?

23:48.215 --> 23:51.006
Be careful, Lucas.

23:59.754 --> 24:02.588
Beware.

24:04.588 --> 24:06.171
Here is shrapnel.

24:06.921 --> 24:08.463
We have to wait.

24:08.963 --> 24:12.171
- Careful.
- Lucas?

24:16.879 --> 24:19.296
Tännepäinkö, Santiago?

24:20.921 --> 24:24.129
- I do not trust him.
- What?

24:24.879 --> 24:27.878
- He did not even find there.
- Quietly.

24:29.961 --> 24:33.627
Santiago? This is it?

24:51.086 --> 24:55.794
Wait, wait... Did you hear?

24:56.543 --> 24:59.794
Someone's coming. Switch off the torches.
Turn it off.

25:04.376 --> 25:06.792
- Are you sure this is it?
- I am.

25:07.542 --> 25:13.335
- Archives is not like one.
- This does not look in the archives.

25:14.085 --> 25:19.376
- Here you can not see anything.
- Find the light switch.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.959
Here is one.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.335
Finally doing something right.

25:26.042 --> 25:30.750
- You three did not see it.
- What are we looking for?

25:31.959 --> 25:37.792
- My brother spoke cinefilms.
- Cinefilms here?

25:38.833 --> 25:42.833
- Quite suspicious.
- You are always so negative.

25:44.249 --> 25:46.582
Towards you.

25:48.832 --> 25:50.374
Okay.

25:50.915 --> 25:53.208
Why stuffed animal?

25:54.790 --> 25:58.498
When people leave their children in the graves
gifts, they end up here.

25:59.249 --> 26:05.248
- Is not that the projector?
- It is in good condition.

26:10.789 --> 26:13.872
- Want to help?
- Seek cine.

26:14.622 --> 26:20.122
We need to find something
against which reflects it.

26:22.164 --> 26:25.663
Good, we have a projector
and where to reflect.

26:26.413 --> 26:30.289
Now you just have to reflect.

26:34.164 --> 26:36.871
Can you find something?

26:42.538 --> 26:47.038
- Are they these?
- Those seem to cinefilms.

26:47.787 --> 26:50.620
- Are they them?
- You know how it works?

26:51.370 --> 26:55.870
I know. My father had a Super-16.

26:56.620 --> 27:01.829
Watched cinefilms Sundays.
It was the best thing we did.

27:02.578 --> 27:05.786
- Sounds nice.
- Do not break it.

27:06.954 --> 27:09.536
It is suitable for.

27:13.619 --> 27:15.994
All right.

27:18.868 --> 27:22.118
- All seems to be fine.
- Is this the Sergio told?

27:22.868 --> 27:28.202
I do not know. This copy.
I do not know if this is it.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.827
- Wait, the image of all.
- Well done, girl.

27:37.576 --> 27:40.035
- I think of everything.
- Why?

27:40.785 --> 27:45.868
- To get a copy of the film.
- You've learned something.

27:47.327 --> 27:51.576
- Come on, Joshua.
- Are you ready?

27:52.327 --> 27:58.534
Three, two, one...

28:00.116 --> 28:04.491
- It works.
- Great.

28:06.950 --> 28:10.783
<i>Not!</i>

28:14.490 --> 28:17.950
<i>Oh, God, no...</i>

28:18.700 --> 28:20.241
<i>Not!</i>

28:20.783 --> 28:26.574
<i>- Movie is this.
- No! No.</i>

28:27.324 --> 28:31.074
I do not like this.
This seems strange.

28:31.823 --> 28:37.157
- What do you mean?
- Close it! Deuce!

28:37.906 --> 28:41.406
- Are you okay, Santiago?
- I do not.

28:42.156 --> 28:46.906
- What's the matter?
- I know him.

28:47.656 --> 28:51.989
- Hänellähän on the hood.
- You do not have to watch.

28:52.739 --> 28:56.488
- The door is over there. You can go.
- Benjamin!

28:57.239 --> 29:03.364
- We have to stay and watch it.
- Are you okay, Santiago?

29:04.113 --> 29:07.072
I thought it was a dream.

29:09.072 --> 29:13.446
My brother after the death of
is like one would follow me.

29:14.197 --> 29:17.571
- Calm down.
- I have to go! Throw it away!

29:18.322 --> 29:21.737
I need some fresh air.

29:23.154 --> 29:28.196
- What's the matter?
- He's crazy.

29:28.946 --> 29:31.362
- I'll go.
- Hell, Lucas.

29:32.112 --> 29:35.987
Why are you always like that?
Just a moment ago we found it.

29:36.736 --> 29:41.778
- I describe a little graveyard.
- Let him go. We look at this.

29:42.527 --> 29:45.694
- Be careful.
- Go now.

30:01.985 --> 30:05.278
Hell, this is scary.

30:08.777 --> 30:14.110
Friends, I come bringing peace.
I'll be bringing peace.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.193
Hell.

30:29.692 --> 30:33.109
<i>No...</i>

30:33.858 --> 30:38.193
<i>No, please be nice!</i>

30:38.942 --> 30:43.692
Give me the camera, Benjamin.
Figure reactions.

30:44.442 --> 30:49.108
<i>No, no!</i>

30:49.857 --> 30:56.607
<i>No, no! No!</i>

31:02.399 --> 31:05.149
What a cold!

31:10.066 --> 31:16.773
I'm not afraid, I'm afraid,
I am not afraid, I'm afraid.

31:31.189 --> 31:37.897
Santiago! Is that you, in Santiago?

31:39.605 --> 31:41.438
Santiago?

31:43.939 --> 31:49.189
No, no! What's that noise?

32:03.313 --> 32:06.020
Santiago!

32:08.437 --> 32:12.187
Stop fooling around! Santiago!

32:13.978 --> 32:15.687
Hell...

32:16.436 --> 32:21.312
<i>No, no, no!</i>

32:22.394 --> 32:26.145
<i>No, no, no!</i>

32:42.726 --> 32:45.976
What's that noise?

32:59.685 --> 33:02.517
Is it you, Santiago?

33:04.225 --> 33:06.474
Santiago?

33:08.724 --> 33:11.850
Hell, that's cold.

33:21.142 --> 33:23.808
What is that?

33:26.099 --> 33:28.183
Hell, hell...

33:31.224 --> 33:33.683
Hell!

33:37.308 --> 33:43.515
<i>No, the star of the creator... No!</i>

34:08.264 --> 34:10.889
Hell, hell...

34:16.721 --> 34:22.721
- Help! Help!
- Santiago?

34:23.469 --> 34:25.888
Hell!

34:29.096 --> 34:35.512
Help! Help! No!

34:37.179 --> 34:40.387
- What was it?
- You hear me?

34:41.138 --> 34:46.719
<i>- Help!
- It's Lucas! Hasten!</i>

34:50.886 --> 34:53.469
Lucas!

34:58.178 --> 35:01.427
- What happened?
- Something took Santiago.

35:02.178 --> 35:06.761
Something took him by the neck.
I saw it.

35:07.510 --> 35:10.552
- Hell!
- What the hell is going on?

35:11.386 --> 35:16.011
- Hell! Run, jump, Carla!
- What happened? Hell.

35:16.760 --> 35:19.468
Where is he?

35:21.510 --> 35:25.635
Where is he?

35:26.884 --> 35:28.426
Hell!

35:29.176 --> 35:35.676
What happened? Where is Santiago?
Hell! Santiago!

35:36.426 --> 35:43.676
Santiago! Hell, Santiago!

35:44.967 --> 35:50.842
- Breathe, Santiago! Hell! Breathe!
- What do we do, for God's sake?

35:51.591 --> 35:54.633
Breathe, Santiago!

35:55.384 --> 35:58.134
- She finds it difficult to breathe.
- He lives.

35:58.882 --> 36:02.965
- Santiago, breathe.
- What the hell is this?

36:03.715 --> 36:06.757
- God!
- What we do?

36:08.049 --> 36:13.674
Listen to me, Santiago,
for God's sake. No, do not...

36:14.424 --> 36:19.382
No, do not... No! No!

36:20.132 --> 36:25.090
- No, no, no!
- Who can we call?

36:25.840 --> 36:28.174
- We have to call someone.
- To whom?

36:28.924 --> 36:33.257
- We have to go!
- We will be charged!

36:34.006 --> 36:36.422
Oh, God, no...

36:58.088 --> 37:02.462
- What the hell was that? Santiago is dead.
- What happened to Lucas?

37:03.213 --> 37:07.713
How to Santiago can fall from heaven?
It is not possible to.

37:08.461 --> 37:13.586
- Say something!
- I do not know. Something took him!

37:14.337 --> 37:19.961
One of the objects, the devil. The head was hanging,
like a necklace should be broken.

37:21.878 --> 37:25.171
- Visit the images through Benjamin.
- No they do not have any.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.503
What do you mean? I photographed all the time.

37:29.254 --> 37:34.003
These pictures are missing.
Everything is, except for those pictures.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.920
It does not matter.
We have the best documentaries ever.

37:38.670 --> 37:42.670
- What are you talking about? Man is dead.
- Calm down.

37:43.418 --> 37:47.377
You do not understand. I can not flunk courses,
and in these images...

37:48.127 --> 37:52.543
- We have to figure this out.
- But let me not that.

37:53.294 --> 37:57.543
Stop, Joshua. I'm going home.
Hell! Stop!

37:58.294 --> 38:00.335
All right. Take it easy.

38:01.085 --> 38:03.377
- You always have to spoil everything.
- Enter the camera here.

38:04.127 --> 38:07.210
- And now you want the camera?
- The video must be in it.

38:07.959 --> 38:11.294
Give it!
Open, please.

38:12.418 --> 38:14.668
Calm down, Lucas.

38:16.042 --> 38:18.208
Hell.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.708
Second study day.

38:30.457 --> 38:36.208
Yesterday it became known that the reaction videos
involved were from all kuolleet-

38:36.958 --> 38:40.541
And very peculiar circumstances.

38:42.416 --> 38:48.707
Yesterday, died in Santiago. One of them brother.
He helped us.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.706
His death was...

38:54.831 --> 38:57.706
I do not know how to explain it.

39:00.706 --> 39:04.706
We managed to get the original filmin-

39:05.455 --> 39:09.040
And it seems to be a connection
deaths.

39:09.790 --> 39:14.290
Do not say so, Carla. We do not know whether the film
do with it.

39:15.040 --> 39:20.372
- We can not draw conclusions.
- It is a hypothesis, Joshua.

39:21.123 --> 39:25.039
- We have to have something.
- It's a good hypothesis.

39:25.788 --> 39:31.954
But if the film seemed to them,
not we risk the same fate?

39:32.704 --> 39:37.538
- Do not worry about it now, Joshua.
- Of course I'm worried.

39:38.288 --> 39:43.954
Santiago saw it, and to him it seemed.
He died in the cemetery. What about us?

39:44.704 --> 39:48.746
We have seen worse
and we're still here.

39:49.495 --> 39:55.703
Describe only. Carla, download pictures
and transfer them to my computer.

39:56.453 --> 39:57.996
I prefer to work at home.

39:58.203 --> 40:01.370
- Do not you stay here?
- I do not. At home is better.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.203
- Will you really continue?
- Nobody is forcing you, Joshua.

40:05.952 --> 40:09.619
I know. But what more do you need?
That the other dies, Carla?

40:10.370 --> 40:16.202
Do I have the material? Nothing.
We can not use Santiago.

40:16.952 --> 40:21.202
It would link us to the crime.
What the hell do you think?

40:21.952 --> 40:28.119
- We should have called the police.
- Call the police. Take this and call!

40:28.869 --> 40:33.286
What are you going to say?
That we were at the cemetery?

40:34.035 --> 40:40.742
That guy died, and when we looked
cinefilms? I do not want to be involved.

40:41.492 --> 40:46.034
- Reporters would eat us up alive.
- Exactly.

40:46.784 --> 40:52.450
I'm online a couple of minutes,
when I get home.

40:53.200 --> 41:00.617
Keep shooting. Carla's right.
We need more material.

41:03.742 --> 41:06.784
- Hey ago.
- Hello.

41:19.407 --> 41:22.948
Joshua... I'm sorry if I'm tight, but I have...

41:23.698 --> 41:27.782
- Do not worry. Everything is fine.
- You want me to leave?

41:28.532 --> 41:30.740
I do not. We need to continue to work.

41:31.490 --> 41:35.823
<i>Not! Lucas! Lucas!</i>

41:38.698 --> 41:44.198
<i>No, no, no!</i>

42:15.446 --> 42:19.530
Joshua...
I've seen this before.

42:20.279 --> 42:24.362
- Are you kidding?
- I saw this in one book.

42:25.112 --> 42:26.654
Where?

42:26.904 --> 42:32.029
As I read Spanish history,
in one book Inquisition.

42:32.779 --> 42:39.819
- Are you sure?
- Yes. The book in college.

42:42.486 --> 42:47.320
Haemmeko it? Come lets go.

42:51.443 --> 42:54.193
We are on the way out, Benja.
What you have?

42:54.943 --> 42:58.068
I have gone through the material.
Did you notice the sound?

42:58.818 --> 43:05.359
- We do not. We looked at the pictures.
- In the background is the sound.

43:06.110 --> 43:11.068
They are lower than what the person can hear.

43:12.110 --> 43:16.484
Take a look. This is what we hear.

43:17.235 --> 43:21.484
This information is very shallow votes.

43:22.235 --> 43:25.901
But if you raise the frequency,
we can hear it.

43:26.650 --> 43:32.192
It's like a complaint
or strange noises.

43:33.317 --> 43:36.025
I take it on so you can hear.

43:58.399 --> 44:02.565
- Are you sure that they are the voices?
- I do not know.

44:03.315 --> 44:08.606
- At least strange noise.
- Can you isolate it?

44:09.356 --> 44:12.814
No, but Lucas could.

44:23.356 --> 44:28.480
- What now? Why did you send the audio file?
- Help me, Lucas.

44:29.231 --> 44:33.522
- What is it?
- It is a background sound.

44:34.273 --> 44:38.189
Will you continue in spite of everything?

44:39.105 --> 44:43.437
- This way.
- I trust you.

44:54.979 --> 44:56.812
What is this?

44:57.562 --> 45:03.187
These are the editions that have been archived,
because the new has come.

45:05.562 --> 45:08.646
Shelf, we are looking for, it is around here.

45:09.394 --> 45:12.477
Come on, help me.

45:14.602 --> 45:20.435
Lucas, you have no choice.
You are tangled in them more than we do.

45:21.186 --> 45:25.353
You were there.
You are the only one who saw the object.

45:26.103 --> 45:31.186
I only ask that you go through the tape.
Correct pronunciation and that's all.

45:35.228 --> 45:37.727
Please.

45:38.894 --> 45:40.935
Okay.

45:45.143 --> 45:48.601
It's here somewhere.

45:50.976 --> 45:53.351
Here it is.

46:10.392 --> 46:15.226
- We're going over there.
- Will follow suit.

46:15.975 --> 46:18.975
- I trust you.
- So.

46:20.432 --> 46:24.641
- Do not touch anything.
- I do not, of course.

46:36.099 --> 46:40.307
- We're almost there.
- I'm behind you.

46:47.307 --> 46:49.390
Do you hear?

46:54.139 --> 46:59.972
- It is a strange language.
- I do not understand it.

47:03.472 --> 47:08.014
The book is one of these shelves.
Wait.

47:09.805 --> 47:11.597
None.

47:13.097 --> 47:18.305
It was a long series of numbers.
It should be this one.

47:31.845 --> 47:38.845
The book is big and old,
so it should not be hard to find.

47:46.095 --> 47:49.178
- Here it is.
- Are you sure?

47:50.928 --> 47:53.678
This is the book.

47:55.095 --> 48:00.511
- I knew that I could find it.
- How did you know that it would be here?

48:01.262 --> 48:03.636
I know the secret places in college.

48:07.885 --> 48:12.426
- As if they laulaisivat.
- Listen.

48:15.343 --> 48:17.510
Part two votes.

48:19.676 --> 48:21.885
- Did you hear?
- It sounded like Quechua.

48:22.635 --> 48:25.093
Do you remember
that I was an intern here?

48:25.843 --> 48:29.968
- I remember.
- Trainee...

48:30.718 --> 48:33.968
I got banned in many places.

48:34.718 --> 48:38.176
- Give me the book.
- Why did not you tell me about it?

48:38.925 --> 48:41.799
- There was no reason for it.
- I told a lot.

48:42.549 --> 48:48.591
- Everyone has secrets.
- It seems so.

48:49.342 --> 48:53.674
We will go back,
so we can read the book.

49:07.633 --> 49:10.883
- Do you understand Quechua?
- I do not, but it's not difficult.

49:11.632 --> 49:15.298
- We go to Isabel.
- Isabel? No, I do not want to.

49:16.048 --> 49:18.048
- He understands Quechua.
- Yeah, but...

49:18.798 --> 49:23.923
- But what? You wanted to know.
- He tells me to settle handed.

49:25.173 --> 49:28.007
- Shall we?
- Alright.

49:28.756 --> 49:34.839
- Take your camera and shoot all of them.
- Clear. See you there.

49:49.963 --> 49:53.213
Look at this. "During the Inquisition" -

49:53.963 --> 49:58.921
", A woman was the victim of priest
The priest wanted him." -

49:59.670 --> 50:01.379
"But the woman, who the priest."

50:02.130 --> 50:06.545
"She married a rich man,
who loved him."

50:07.296 --> 50:11.255
"
But the priest ordered the men to be killed" -

50:12.004 --> 50:16.296
"And tried again to seduce a woman.
Female rejected him again."

50:17.045 --> 50:23.212
"A priest accused woman the man's death
and a woman was sentenced to a terrible death."

50:23.961 --> 50:28.586
"She made a deal with the devil
and vowed revenge."

50:29.335 --> 50:34.669
- Revenge? Who does he take vengeance?
- Catholics.

50:35.418 --> 50:39.668
Believers. Sounds reasonable.

50:40.418 --> 50:43.460
The ecclesiastical leader of torturing him and to kill hänet-

50:44.211 --> 50:48.169
So it is logical,
that he wants revenge.

50:52.335 --> 50:56.877
- Carla? Are you okay, Carla?
- We have to go!

50:57.626 --> 51:03.751
What happens, Carla!
Carla, please! What is happening?

51:04.501 --> 51:09.084
Oh my God, Carla. It does not end well!

51:09.834 --> 51:15.126
What is happening?
Suddenly, out of here!

51:25.126 --> 51:29.042
- Behave properly.
- Alright.

51:32.707 --> 51:34.707
Call again.

51:36.749 --> 51:41.374
- Isabel.
- Hey, Lucas. What is he doing here?

51:42.124 --> 51:46.624
I'm sorry, but we work together
. And he is now more mature.

51:47.373 --> 51:50.040
- Not you, Benjamin?
- You are a moron.

51:50.790 --> 51:54.749
- What do you want?
- I have an audio file.

51:55.498 --> 52:00.749
I think that speech is Quechua, but I'm not sure
. Can we listen to it?

52:01.498 --> 52:03.664
You do not imagine,
that he can come in?

52:04.413 --> 52:06.956
We kissed.
I did not do anything strange.

52:07.705 --> 52:10.330
Can we focus on this?

52:13.289 --> 52:19.080
- I'm going to the Internet and listen to it.
- Terrific. Thank you, Isabel.

52:21.080 --> 52:24.330
- Take your camera because I will.
- I speak with him...

52:25.080 --> 52:29.705
- And you go to Jeshua creates.
- There, too, is a crazy woman.

52:30.455 --> 52:36.454
- Can you drive me home?
- I can.

52:40.411 --> 52:44.287
- I'll leave the camera here.
- Clear. Take it home.

52:45.661 --> 52:47.204
What happened to the library?

52:47.536 --> 52:53.536
I do not know. Carla read a book out loud
and bookcases began to move strangely.

52:54.287 --> 53:01.411
I do not know why. We ran out.
I felt something strange.

53:02.453 --> 53:03.995
What do you mean?

53:04.578 --> 53:09.327
I can not explain.
I felt someone's presence.

53:10.078 --> 53:13.286
- You were there alone.
- I know, but...

53:14.035 --> 53:20.576
I do not know, there was something.
I do not want to talk about it any more.

53:21.326 --> 53:25.576
Book pictures correspond
images cinefilms.

53:26.327 --> 53:30.244
It's got to be a curse.
I told you.

53:30.994 --> 53:37.327
Okay. Cine tells the real
Inquisition to do with torture.

53:38.076 --> 53:40.451
- It is impossible.
- Why?

53:41.202 --> 53:45.534
Not at that time had cameras.
It is a presentation, or something like that.

53:46.284 --> 53:52.534
Sure, but there's something strange.
The book tells of the curse.

53:53.283 --> 53:57.242
From the curse?
That's ridiculous, Joshua.

53:57.992 --> 54:02.657
Santiago is dead, hell!
Ridiculous? There are too many coincidences.

54:03.407 --> 54:07.657
And what happened now in the library.

54:08.407 --> 54:12.075
- Too many coincidences.
- Can I see it?

54:12.824 --> 54:16.741
All productions are errors,
which will never notice it.

54:17.491 --> 54:19.741
We need to look at closely.

54:25.823 --> 54:29.031
- Is it really Quechua?
- I'm sure of it.

54:29.781 --> 54:33.447
A few of phrase, at least is Quechua.
"Wañuy" refers to death.

54:34.198 --> 54:37.364
- "Uku Pacha" is hell.
- And the rest?

54:38.115 --> 54:41.990
- I do not understand it.
- Listen once again.

54:52.990 --> 54:54.989
Stop.

54:56.281 --> 54:58.780
It is Quechua.

55:00.738 --> 55:03.613
- What did you do?
- Kelasin back.

55:04.363 --> 55:06.946
There it is! It is backwards.

55:11.946 --> 55:14.071
- And that?
- I do not know.

55:14.821 --> 55:19.988
- It was not there before.
- Toistatko video?

55:22.863 --> 55:24.946
It is different.

55:56.152 --> 55:57.694
You're kidding, Benjamin!
Say that you calculate to play.

55:58.069 --> 56:02.610
I have not done anything!
The camera has described himself.

56:09.817 --> 56:11.359
- Oh, my God.
- Hell!

56:11.609 --> 56:15.942
- What's happening?
- Wait, this can not be true.

56:16.984 --> 56:21.567
We have missed something.
Now then, will be considered.

56:22.317 --> 56:23.859
It is repeated many times.

56:24.235 --> 56:28.192
Cursed are the believers.
Cursed are the liars.

56:28.942 --> 56:32.859
I follow you to death,
as you have me.

56:33.609 --> 56:37.900
- Did you see the video?
- Yes, but only the beginning.

56:39.609 --> 56:43.817
Be careful, Lucas.
With some things not played.

56:44.565 --> 56:49.024
It sounds like a curse.
Such should not be entangled.

56:49.773 --> 56:51.316
What have you done, Lucas?

56:58.315 --> 57:02.107
- What is this?
- I do not understand anything.

57:02.857 --> 57:07.690
- It's a curse!
- We need to study more.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.148
Do you really want to continue?
It is Benjamin.

57:12.898 --> 57:18.940
Curse or not, I want to know what this is.
We need to know!

57:19.689 --> 57:25.730
Did not you see? We are involved in this.
Close that shit!

57:26.480 --> 57:32.939
- We have to describe it all!
- Call to take control of Lucas.

57:33.981 --> 57:39.480
- Call him!
- He does not answer, Joshua.

57:40.730 --> 57:44.146
- What now?
- The phone is off.

57:44.896 --> 57:49.521
Go find him.
Please!

57:50.270 --> 57:52.937
Some doors do not open.

57:53.687 --> 57:57.687
These creatures are looking for the bus
to reach the world.

57:58.436 --> 58:05.729
- It is sufficient that sees them.
- Oh God. I saw it.

58:14.561 --> 58:19.853
- Hell! Do you curse?
- I do not want to get tangled up in it.

58:20.603 --> 58:26.894
- I'm gone! What I did in the video?
- Stop! We will be clear about it.

58:31.309 --> 58:33.685
That must be Benjamin.

58:37.102 --> 58:42.392
<i>No... No, no, no!</i>

58:45.852 --> 58:50.185
Lucas! No, Lucas!

58:54.601 --> 58:56.726
What do you want?

58:58.434 --> 59:00.476
Let me go!

59:03.391 --> 59:07.933
- What did Lucas the video?
- I do not know! Hurry!

59:08.683 --> 59:13.307
Soon Now! Lucas! Lucas!

59:14.058 --> 59:17.349
- Lucas!
- Open, Lucas!

59:18.100 --> 59:22.016
- Lucas!
- Open! Go!

59:23.766 --> 59:30.183
- Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!
- Where is he?

59:32.515 --> 59:36.724
- Lucas!
- Hell! Look over there! No, no...

59:37.473 --> 59:40.681
No, Lucas...

59:41.431 --> 59:46.224
- I told you! Next I am.
- Shut up, Lucas is dead!

59:46.973 --> 59:52.014
- What happened?
- The room is something bad.

59:52.764 --> 59:55.223
- Come out of there!
- What happened Isabel?

59:55.973 --> 59:59.305
We have to leave. Why touch her?
He is dead.

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:04.848
- No!
- Come on, let's go.

01:00:05.597 --> 01:00:11.139
Wait for us, Isabel. We are coming.
Lucas?

01:00:11.888 --> 01:00:15.929
No, no...

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:42.762
Run!

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.719
- What happened?
- I do not know!

01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:10.969
- It is a curse.
- I do not know!

01:01:11.719 --> 01:01:13.844
- What does it want?
- Revenge!

01:01:14.594 --> 01:01:18.844
- What do we do with it?
- Shut up, hell!

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:23.218
I do not understand.
What does it want?

01:01:23.968 --> 01:01:29.550
- Where the hell Isabel lives?
- Continue straight ahead! Hurry!

01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:35.009
- What do you do?
- I'm gonna call Carla.

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:39.550
- Why?
- I warn her!

01:01:41.717 --> 01:01:45.925
Joshua. Everything is the pictures.
We have to go to the cemetery.

01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:50.550
Listen, Carla.
We will stop this. It is over.

01:01:51.299 --> 01:01:54.091
- What happened?
- Lucas is dead.

01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:59.381
- I do not know what happened.
- What do you mean? Dead?

01:02:00.132 --> 01:02:03.381
Wait for us!

01:02:06.132 --> 01:02:08.799
Lucas...

01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:35.797
Lucas!

01:02:51.671 --> 01:02:54.089
Lucas!

01:03:02.337 --> 01:03:04.837
Stop!

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.461
Not! Creator!

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:12.250
Hell!

01:04:19.499 --> 01:04:23.583
- This is bad!
- Drive faster!

01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:27.167
I'm gonna call Carla.
He needs to know.

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:32.583
- You are always the same. Why are you calling?
- Be quiet!

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:35.958
- Where are you, Carla?
- What's the matter?

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:40.624
I do not understand.
What do you do there?

01:04:41.373 --> 01:04:44.373
- Where is he?
- I can not hear!

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.372
What are you going to do there?

01:04:49.873 --> 01:04:54.789
Listen to me. Stay where you are.
We'll get there.

01:04:55.539 --> 01:04:59.998
- Well?
- He's at the cemetery.

01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:06.123
- The cemetery? What's he doing there?
- He says that the photos...

01:05:06.872 --> 01:05:10.539
That everything is there.
We need to get this to an end.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:15.706
I knew that he has a plan.
He attracts us there.

01:05:16.456 --> 01:05:21.122
And to attract!
No! Shut up!

01:05:21.871 --> 01:05:25.955
- Carla!
- Carla! Where the hell is he?

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:29.871
Carla? Carla?

01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:35.913
- Carla. What are you doing here, Carla?
- Some visited me.

01:05:36.662 --> 01:05:40.329
- You invented more than to come here?
- It all started here.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.037
- Really? Tell me what happened.
- Stop it, Benjamin.

01:05:45.787 --> 01:05:48.662
- How do you talk to Benjamin?
- Activate the camera.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:55.662
Boyfriend believes everything you say,
but I do not! Tell what this is about!

01:05:56.411 --> 01:06:01.078
- What are you talking about?
- What do you want to do here, Carla?

01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:04.161
- What is it?
- I have no idea!

01:06:04.911 --> 01:06:09.994
- You brought us here.
- We are all involved in this!

01:06:10.744 --> 01:06:15.161
Do not you understand? Some visited me.
Hell!

01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:17.911
Carla...

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:27.785
- Something pushed me.
- Kuvasitko it? Is not that agreed?

01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:31.117
- Please, Benjamin.
- No, I do not photographed.

01:06:31.867 --> 01:06:35.784
How about that! We take pictures of everything.
All deaths.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:40.451
- That's enough, Benjamin!
- You will not notice anything.

01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:45.325
We are here because of him.
He brought us here.

01:06:46.076 --> 01:06:49.951
We all agree.
All.

01:06:52.159 --> 01:06:55.700
This is the curse of the book.
Curse.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:59.325
Photos, paintings,
all to confirm it.

01:07:00.076 --> 01:07:04.201
Yes, the curse.
How are freed from it?

01:07:04.949 --> 01:07:09.324
A woman was killed unjustly
during the Inquisition.

01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:12.282
He vowed to revenge.

01:07:13.032 --> 01:07:16.657
How it relates to us?
I do not even go to church.

01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:19.824
We have to study it.
The answers are here.

01:07:20.574 --> 01:07:24.115
- You're crazy.
- No, it all started here.

01:07:24.865 --> 01:07:30.531
- Carla... We left here the deceased.
- I know, Joshua. I know.

01:07:31.282 --> 01:07:35.489
Santiago died, Isabel died.
Lucas is dead.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.199
We are following.
We need to get it to an end.

01:07:40.948 --> 01:07:44.405
Archive Room.
The answer must be there.

01:07:45.156 --> 01:07:49.113
- Die here.
- Stop, Benjamin!

01:07:49.863 --> 01:07:52.780
Do you know what? Go to hell!

01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.405
- Please...
- I'm tired of follow tyttöäsi.

01:07:57.155 --> 01:08:00.238
- Shut up, Benjamin!
- Activate the camera. I will go.

01:08:00.988 --> 01:08:05.529
Where are you going? Can you stop?

01:08:09.738 --> 01:08:14.155
- Oh my God, what is that?
- No no!

01:08:14.904 --> 01:08:19.154
- Run! No...
- Hell!

01:08:19.904 --> 01:08:22.237
- Run!
- Hell...

01:08:22.987 --> 01:08:27.237
What the...?

01:08:32.111 --> 01:08:35.944
We need to find cine
and destroy it. It is the only way!

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:40.486
- What's happening?
- Search, search! This is bad!

01:08:41.236 --> 01:08:45.028
- Where the hell is it?
- Creator...

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:52.194
- This projector is not a film!
- No, please...

01:08:52.944 --> 01:08:59.027
- Joshua!
- What am I doing there?

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:07.859
Run! Run!

01:09:12.234 --> 01:09:17.359
- Benjamin!
- Help! Help!

01:09:19.818 --> 01:09:24.568
Hell! Run, jump, Carla! Run!

01:09:26.482 --> 01:09:29.774
- What, Carla?
- Benjamin is dead, Joshua.

01:09:30.524 --> 01:09:33.733
- Benjamin is dead.
- Listen...

01:09:34.482 --> 01:09:41.192
Run, Carla, run!
Carla! Run, jump, Carla! Hurry!

01:09:41.942 --> 01:09:44.441
Run! Creator...

01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:52.691
Hell! No, no...

01:09:56.773 --> 01:10:00.523
What are you doing, Carla? We have to go.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:07.272
- Joshua... Please forgive me.
- Carla, come on. Please.

01:10:08.023 --> 01:10:12.522
Please forgive me, please.
I did not want to do it.

01:10:13.272 --> 01:10:18.106
- What you're talking about, Carla?
- He forced me.

01:10:18.856 --> 01:10:22.605
- Forgive me, please.
- Benjamin is dead. It drives us back.

01:10:23.355 --> 01:10:29.814
When someone dies as he,
raped, tortured...

01:10:30.563 --> 01:10:33.688
- When the soul calls for revenge.
- Where the hell you're talking about?

01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:40.854
He must keep on killing.
He must continue. I do not want to.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:46.270
It was the only way...
It was the only way I survive.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.979
Have you heard the reaction from videos?

01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:56.312
- This is a forbidden zone.
- I have the key.

01:10:57.063 --> 01:10:59.520
I feel like one of them.
Do you take us to the cemetery?

01:11:00.271 --> 01:11:02.853
I've seen this before.
Here it is.

01:11:03.603 --> 01:11:08.146
- Are you sure?
- I got to prohibited places.

01:11:08.894 --> 01:11:10.436
Was this wise?

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:18.519
Please forgive me, Joshua.
I was forced to sacrifice them.

01:11:19.268 --> 01:11:22.561
I had to save myself,
to survive to survive.

01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:25.268
I had to sacrifice them.

01:11:26.019 --> 01:11:32.727
Sergio and his friends! Lucas,
Benjamin, Isabel! Sacrificed them!

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:37.518
Did you kill them, Carla?
Benjamin was right.

01:11:38.269 --> 01:11:40.894
- No!
- It's your fault! You killed them!

01:11:41.642 --> 01:11:43.684
Not!

01:11:45.517 --> 01:11:48.143
It was him.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.142
Carla!

01:11:57.142 --> 01:11:59.475
Help me!

01:12:02.975 --> 01:12:07.934
Kill him! Kill him!

01:12:08.684 --> 01:12:13.850
Do not fight it.
Do not fight!

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:20.099
- Joshua, do not do resistance.
- Help me!

01:12:20.849 --> 01:12:25.224
Kill him!
I do not want her to suffer!

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.183
Die, please!

01:12:31.473 --> 01:12:34.890
Kill him, please!

01:12:39.223 --> 01:12:46.598
Do not fight it.
Do not fight Joshua.

01:12:50.181 --> 01:12:53.056
Joshua!

01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:57.263
No...

01:14:09.384 --> 01:14:13.135
What this book is, honey?

01:14:14.135 --> 01:14:20.592
Did you find it?
I want to read a story.
