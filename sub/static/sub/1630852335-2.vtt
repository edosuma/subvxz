Additional $100,000 operational

10:27.560 --> 10:28.593
Dragons, I'm here to guarantee
one thing:

10:29.963 --> 10:30.828
Your bathrooms, more importantly
your toilet and toilet seats,

10:30.897 --> 10:31.862
Are making you and your family
sick.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.332
When you flush your toilets,
do you flush them lid up

10:34.401 --> 10:36.034
Or lid down?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.603
-Lid up.
-Abstaining from the vote?

-Okay.
-No, my lid down.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.005

puts the toilet seat down

10:41.074 --> 10:42.573
On its own, so.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.475
Mine does too, but it flushes
with the lid up.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.076
Okay.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.644
[wes] you walk into arlene's
house, the toilet says, "hello".

10:46.647 --> 10:48.046
[michele] yes.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.981
So the whole reason why we think
we close the lid is to prevent

10:50.049 --> 10:51.015
Splashback.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.083
We've all been splashed by a
toilet before.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.518
It's pretty disgusting, right?

10:53.586 --> 10:54.752
Or if you've ever sat down and
initiated a flush, you felt

10:54.821 --> 10:56.320
Those moisture particles hit
your behind.

10:56.389 --> 11:00.158
[laughs]

11:00.226 --> 11:01.693
[ryan] but the major reason why
we're supposed to do it is

11:01.761 --> 11:03.828
To prevent something called
toilet plume.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.663
Now, toilet plume is an
invisible mist made up

11:05.732 --> 11:08.433
Of bioaerosols that happen every
time you flush that bathroom

11:08.501 --> 11:09.567

about it?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.101
Introducing the common sense
toilet seat line.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.302
This international
patent-pending product uses

11:44.370 --> 11:46.771
Hospital grade antimicrobial
rubber to create that perfect

11:46.839 --> 11:50.241
Seal on your toilet, just like
your magnetic refrigerator

11:50.309 --> 11:52.410
At home.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.545
[michele] there are some things
I like to learn,

11:53.613 --> 11:55.379
And there are some things I just
don't wanna know.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.048
And just because we don't know
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.416
You guys have samples in front
of you right now.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.019
[michele] okay.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.420
[manjit] oh my god, my name on
my toilet seat!

12:02.488 --> 12:03.455
The one is the newest place I
have seen my face.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.555
-This--manjit, you look great.
-[arlene] oh jeez.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.424
[manjit] oh goodness, yes!

12:06.492 --> 12:08.059
[vincenzo] wes, why is your head
so big?

12:08.127 --> 12:09.327
[wes] you're killing me here.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.362
[ryan] so this seat here,
you've got the magnet,

12:11.364 --> 12:14.766
So it perfectly
seals to the bowl.

12:14.834 --> 12:20.571
And this one's our $39.95 lid.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.540
Another important point,
if I can, there's four other

12:22.608 --> 12:23.641
Major features with these lids,
not just blocking the plume.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.977
[vincenzo] right.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.312
[ryan] number one is there's no
slamming noise.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.781
-So, like it doesn't--
-so my wife will be happy.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.984
[ryan] number two is because it
all seals up airtight,

12:33.052 --> 12:34.652
It reduces flushing noise by up
to 60%.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.521
You know when you flush lid up
it's noisy,

12:36.589 --> 12:37.388
Lid down it's quieter?

12:37.456 --> 12:40.258
So why can't you just close the
lid?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.926
Why do I need it suctioned?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.127
Like, it's a very simple
solution to the problem.

12:43.129 --> 12:43.694
Because it spills out the sides
here, and that's what--

12:43.763 --> 12:46.197
[manjit] but how much?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.232
Like, come on, 2% of it falls
out the lid?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.934
If I could bring it up, it says,
and I'm not--I wouldn't snow

12:50.002 --> 12:53.271
You guys--it says for how many
particles that get

12:53.339 --> 12:54.272
Into the bathroom.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.073
The difference between the two,
up or down, it's negligible,

12:56.075 --> 12:57.175
So this is what--

12:57.243 --> 12:59.277
Oh, come on!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.145

toilet at home.

toilets in canada.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.821

traction.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.092
Ryan, I'm out.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.895
So it sounds like you don't

15:39.973 --> 15:41.639
I mean, in canada, there's 38

15:41.707 --> 15:44.675
Yes, everybody's got a toilet,
