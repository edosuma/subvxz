Maybe your uncle
will let you live with us, Francesco.

01:42.365 --> 01:43.725
Of course he won't.

01:47.685 --> 01:48.605
[Jacopo] Francesco!

01:51.645 --> 01:52.885
Francesco, Guglielmo!

01:54.165 --> 01:55.485
Here now, come.

01:55.845 --> 01:56.685
You are my wards now.

01:57.045 --> 02:00.725
Jacopo, their parents were just buried.
Let them spend a while with their friends.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.445
I'm calling off the engagement
between Guglielmo

02:03.525 --> 02:04.845
and your granddaughter, Ma donna.

02:05.645 --> 02:07.045
They are pledged to one another.

02:07.205 --> 02:08.645
Not by me, and not anymore.

02:08.725 --> 02:11.165
Guglielmo's late father wished peace
between our families.

02:11.245 --> 02:12.565
This union would ensure it.

02:12.645 --> 02:14.484
Peace? Peace?

02:15.204 --> 02:17.685
There will never be peace
between the families, Ma donna.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.085
Come, Francesco.

02:22.525 --> 02:23.805
Stay where you are.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.085
Don't touch him.

02:43.045 --> 02:44.565
Get out of my way.

02:46.605 --> 02:48.685
Or you feel the force of my hand, too.

02:49.405 --> 02:51.245
Not in this house, Messer Pazzi.

02:52.485 --> 02:53.765
Lorenzo.

03:01.365 --> 03:02.805
Come.

03:05.365 --> 03:07.125
Come! Come!

03:08.565 --> 03:09.765
[door slams]

03:15.485 --> 03:17.085
You are loyal to a friend.

03:17.805 --> 03:20.365
The sign of a good heart, Lorenzo.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.165
But never pick a fight you can't win.

03:25.045 --> 03:27.085
It only strengthens your enemies.

03:39.125 --> 03:42.565
[woman] You look more anxious
about Bianca's wedding than your own.

03:47.965 --> 03:49.725
Marriage to the Pazzi.

03:50.525 --> 03:53.045
A new treaty ratified with Milan.

03:53.725 --> 03:55.485
You're ascendant, Lorenzo.

03:55.965 --> 03:58.005
-Hmm.
-What do you have to be worried about?

03:59.285 --> 04:02.085
Our bank's finances are precarious.

04:02.445 --> 04:03.885
And this wedding...

04:04.845 --> 04:07.525
will only deepen Jacopo Pazzi's desire
to destroy us.

04:08.405 --> 04:11.645
[Ardinghelli] But he's old.
And you are more than his equal.

04:12.805 --> 04:14.445
And burdened by conscience.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.085
[church bell ringing at a distance]

04:16.325 --> 04:18.165
Which puts me in a disadvantage.

04:21.964 --> 04:23.524
How is conscience...

04:24.404 --> 04:25.805
a disadvantage?

04:29.685 --> 04:31.485
There are moral lines

04:32.165 --> 04:33.525
that I won't cross.

04:34.765 --> 04:36.365
And he has none of those.

04:38.885 --> 04:40.925
There is strength in goodness.

04:42.285 --> 04:45.285
And I believe in you. [sighs]

04:45.565 --> 04:47.685
[footsteps approaching]

04:48.565 --> 04:50.005
Clarice will be waiting.

04:51.445 --> 04:52.565
I should go.

04:54.485 --> 04:56.805
Perhaps she can wait a little bit longer.

04:58.645 --> 04:59.845
Hmm?

-Perhaps.

[conversation continues indistinctly]

05:22.045 --> 05:23.125
[Lucrezia] Clarice.

05:25.245 --> 05:26.805
Clarice!

05:27.125 --> 05:29.285
-...and you and your philosophy...
-I'm sure Lorenzo will be here soon.

05:29.365 --> 05:32.445
[Sandro] All I'm saying is the art
of the ancients remains unsurpassed.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.365
[man] I've studied the art
of the ancients and their philosophy.

05:34.445 --> 05:35.725
Ah, here he is, you see.

05:35.805 --> 05:37.845
-[man] ...painting the same subject...
-Sorry for being late.

05:38.325 --> 05:40.045
You were supposed to be back hours ago.

05:42.645 --> 05:44.165
Couldn't be helped.

05:44.725 --> 05:45.605
Can you forgive me?

05:47.045 --> 05:48.565
Pardon me, Messer Medici.

05:48.925 --> 05:50.125
Messer Maffei is here.

05:50.325 --> 05:51.965
Unannounced, all the way from Volterra?

05:58.325 --> 06:00.125
-Stefano.
-Lorenzo.

06:04.685 --> 06:07.165
Ma donna Medici,
another wedding in the family?

06:07.245 --> 06:08.485
My deepest congratulations.

06:08.565 --> 06:10.045
Thank you, Messer Maffei.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.685
Surely you haven't traveled all this way
to congratulate us.

06:17.405 --> 06:19.405
Some... crystals.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.525
Not just ordinary crystals.

06:21.805 --> 06:23.245
Processed alum.

06:23.645 --> 06:27.005
Uh... to the textile industry,
this is more precious than gold.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.805
It makes color adhere to cloth.

06:28.885 --> 06:31.485
And there are lots more
where that came from.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.285
A shepherd found a mine on his land.

06:34.525 --> 06:37.685
Well, then the people of Volterra
are about to become very rich indeed.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.965
Except, that the textile makers from
across Europe buy from the Pope suppliers.

06:44.285 --> 06:46.085
He cannot afford to be undercut.

06:46.165 --> 06:47.725
We are a small city.

06:47.965 --> 06:49.685
We could offer little defense

06:49.765 --> 06:51.725
should the Pope decide to invade.

06:51.885 --> 06:55.125
Volterra is under Florentine protection.
He wouldn't dare.

06:55.245 --> 06:59.485
No. The Holy Father needs that revenue
to sustain his good works.

06:59.725 --> 07:01.285
He might have no choice.

07:01.365 --> 07:02.445
Then there will be war...

07:02.565 --> 07:04.485
between us and the Pope.

07:04.765 --> 07:06.325
What shall we do?

07:13.005 --> 07:15.565
You must be very tired
after your journey, Stefano.

07:15.805 --> 07:16.685
Come.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.285
Let's have a drink.

07:18.645 --> 07:20.565
Clarice will be very happy
to see you again.

07:20.645 --> 07:21.925
[Stefano] Thank you. Thank you.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.125
[Giuliano] Well, brother,

07:25.525 --> 07:26.845
what are you going to do?

07:31.125 --> 07:33.765
I will ride with Messer Maffei
back to Volterra,

07:34.045 --> 07:35.525
first thing tomorrow morning.

07:36.925 --> 07:39.205
[hooves thundering]

07:54.805 --> 07:56.725
[Stefano] You do remember my son Antonio?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.045
Have the Priori gathered?

07:59.125 --> 08:01.045
They have, as your messenger instructed.

08:01.805 --> 08:03.765
But I am afraid their mood
is not welcoming.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.285
Is that so?

08:06.525 --> 08:08.525
[Stefano] Gentleman, gentleman.

08:08.605 --> 08:12.325
I am returned from Florence
with Lorenzo de' Medici.

08:12.405 --> 08:14.645
Well, you can send him
right back to Florence.

08:14.725 --> 08:17.245
The Priori of Volterra will make
its own decisions.

08:18.725 --> 08:21.005
-You are Messer...
-Vaccari.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.445
Mr. Vaccari is quite right.

08:25.085 --> 08:27.445
The people of Volterra
must make their own decisions.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.365
I had hoped that I might be able to...

08:30.845 --> 08:33.805
first suggest the way
that the people of Volterra might...

08:34.245 --> 08:35.365
protect themselves.

08:35.805 --> 08:38.205
Well, we are about to become wealthy.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.765
And wealth buys protection.

08:41.285 --> 08:43.005
-Yes, it does.
-Hmm.

08:43.365 --> 08:45.125
What happens when the price drops?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.085
Drops?

08:47.525 --> 08:49.365
[scoffs] Why should it drop?

08:49.925 --> 08:51.605
The supply of alum is limited.

08:51.885 --> 08:54.045
If Volterra floods the market then...

08:54.485 --> 08:56.005
well, the prices will drop.

08:56.765 --> 08:58.165
And if your prices drop,
well, then, so will the Pope's.

09:00.845 --> 09:02.765
Then the church will be forced...

09:03.005 --> 09:05.605
to cease your supplies in Volterra.

09:06.525 --> 09:08.045
Then Volterra will be left unprotected.

09:08.525 --> 09:10.845
Tell them your offer, Messer.

09:10.965 --> 09:12.445
[restless chatter]

09:12.645 --> 09:13.845
My bank...

09:14.125 --> 09:16.685
will sell your alum
at three ducats per load.

09:16.885 --> 09:18.525
When we could get five!

09:18.645 --> 09:20.925
Neither more nor less
than the Pope receives.

09:21.765 --> 09:23.485
The market remains stable.

09:23.725 --> 09:25.725
Volterra is protected.

09:26.845 --> 09:28.125
It's a fair offer...

09:28.725 --> 09:31.885
with peace and stability for all.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.725
[crowd applauds]

09:41.285 --> 09:43.645
[Jacopo]
<i>With control of the alum in Volterra,</i>
the advantages for the Medici
will be enormous.

09:49.485 --> 09:52.565
You must implore the Pope
to stop this outrage.

09:52.685 --> 09:56.885
Volterra has its own bishop,
who has spoken to the Holy Father.

09:57.325 --> 10:00.045
As long as the price
of alum does not fall,

10:00.125 --> 10:01.645
the Pope will not act.

10:01.805 --> 10:03.805
Would you excuse us a moment?

10:08.405 --> 10:11.245
Jacopo, I hate the Medici
just as much as you,

10:11.325 --> 10:13.525
-but my hands are tied.
-Tied?

10:15.965 --> 10:18.765
Why then, did I pay to educate you,

10:19.445 --> 10:23.605
place you in the Curia,
and obtain this exalted position?

10:24.165 --> 10:28.885
Not for the love of an orphan child,
or loyalty to your kin, obviously.

10:29.285 --> 10:30.485
[scoffs]

10:32.485 --> 10:34.845
I'm sorry, cousin,

10:35.405 --> 10:36.765
but the facts are not on our side.

10:37.165 --> 10:39.405
Facts? What are facts,

10:40.285 --> 10:42.125
if the truth does not point
in our direction,

10:42.205 --> 10:44.245
then bend it so it does.

10:50.325 --> 10:52.765
[church bell tolls]

10:57.325 --> 10:58.805
[Lucrezia sighs] Just like that.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.845
[Bianca] It feels so wrong
to be so happy, Mama.

11:01.445 --> 11:03.805
-I'm scared it will be snatched away.
-Ah!

11:04.165 --> 11:06.365
Every bride has nerves.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.885
I certainly did.

11:11.085 --> 11:13.885
You and my son, are you happy?

11:14.565 --> 11:15.765
Of course.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.325
[Lucrezia] He has great respect for you.

11:20.725 --> 11:22.805
Lucrezia Ardinghelli is very beautiful.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.845
Lorenzo is young and privileged.

11:31.205 --> 11:34.165
He's not accustomed to being denied
the things he enjoys.

11:36.765 --> 11:39.165
When we met, he said that...

11:39.405 --> 11:41.165
if I gave him my heart,

11:41.245 --> 11:43.365
he would promise before God
to take care of it.

11:46.685 --> 11:48.325
You are very lovely

11:49.725 --> 11:51.965
and more than worthy of his affections.

11:53.565 --> 11:54.725
Give my son time

11:54.805 --> 11:57.365
and he'll learn to deny himself
his youthful pleasures.

11:58.325 --> 12:00.245
Not out of obligation,

12:00.725 --> 12:01.885
but love.

12:02.845 --> 12:03.965
[knock on the door]

12:04.045 --> 12:05.445
Ma donna, there are visitors.

12:20.205 --> 12:21.285
Signor Foscari.

12:22.005 --> 12:24.805
-Ma donna Medici.
-Welcome to Florence.

12:26.285 --> 12:28.325
You remember my daughter, Novella?

12:28.685 --> 12:30.685
Bianca is delighted
that you could attend her wedding.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.645
She's heard a lot about you.

12:32.725 --> 12:34.085
My son is expecting you.

12:34.765 --> 12:35.925
[hawk cries]

12:36.005 --> 12:38.205
[Lorenzo] I appreciate you coming,
Messer Foscari.

12:39.085 --> 12:41.805
You know that hawks must be kept apart.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.925
Close enough that they might fly together.

12:44.045 --> 12:46.045
And if they choose a mate,
then it's for life.

12:47.005 --> 12:48.325
Like humans.

12:49.405 --> 12:52.925
You didn't invite me here
to talk about hawks, Messer Medici.

12:53.845 --> 12:55.725
I wish to propose an alliance.

12:55.805 --> 12:57.485
But you've already chosen your mate.

12:57.765 --> 13:00.885
Florence has just negotiated
a new treaty with Milan.

13:01.885 --> 13:04.205
And now I propose one with Venice.

13:05.645 --> 13:08.525
Well, surely you can see
what shared benefits

13:08.605 --> 13:10.965
peace and stability brings on.

13:11.845 --> 13:14.885
You are young, Lorenzo, and idealistic.

13:14.965 --> 13:16.485
Take my proposal to the doge.

13:17.365 --> 13:19.765
And I'd prepared
to offer something in return.

13:20.965 --> 13:21.845
Such as?

13:22.725 --> 13:24.365
[hawk screeching]

13:27.325 --> 13:28.725
A husband for my daughter?
I might.

13:32.285 --> 13:34.445
Let's talk again
after my sister's wedding.

13:43.445 --> 13:45.765

13:53.085 --> 13:54.445

14:37.405 --> 14:39.085
Here, let me help you.

14:39.685 --> 14:41.005
[Novella] I'm sorry.

14:42.445 --> 14:43.725
I'm so clumsy.

14:44.005 --> 14:46.045
No apology necessary.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.605
Who are you?

14:52.645 --> 14:55.565
A friend of Bianca's. And you?

14:56.965 --> 14:58.805
Brother of the groom.

14:59.925 --> 15:02.165
Then you should be celebrating with him.

15:02.325 --> 15:03.365
Not here.

15:05.525 --> 15:08.565
Taking a bride... is a dangerous game.

15:09.885 --> 15:13.805
Either you further your family interest
by marrying a stranger,

15:14.245 --> 15:15.845
or marry a girl you love

15:16.005 --> 15:17.845
and risk your family's honor.

15:18.645 --> 15:19.685
Myself, I'd...

15:20.005 --> 15:22.205
rather stay out of the game altogether.

15:22.285 --> 15:25.085
As a woman, I have no choice but to play.
But what kind of bride will I be?

15:30.045 --> 15:32.365
Uh... Be careful with that.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.005
A danger to myself...

15:38.845 --> 15:42.045
or to some as yet unknown man?

15:44.245 --> 15:45.605
Very amusing.

15:45.805 --> 15:46.885
[Foscari] Novella.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.765
Novella!

15:50.085 --> 15:51.485
Novella.

15:53.765 --> 15:55.045
Come along.

16:02.165 --> 16:04.005
[people speaking indistinctly]

16:10.205 --> 16:12.285
Shot from Cupid's bow.

16:13.285 --> 16:14.685
Just missed me.

16:15.565 --> 16:16.645
I think.

16:19.325 --> 16:23.165
Oh, I hope this marriage doesn't just end
the feud between our families...

16:24.445 --> 16:26.765
but begins a partnership.

16:26.925 --> 16:30.245
Business, politics. You are aware that

16:30.525 --> 16:32.165
Volterra has found alum.

16:32.565 --> 16:35.405
Yes, and that the Medici bank
will sell it.

16:35.605 --> 16:36.805
There are countries

16:36.885 --> 16:38.805
where the Pazzi bank is more established.

16:38.925 --> 16:42.725
So... you want us to sell it for you.

16:43.405 --> 16:44.525
With us.

16:44.605 --> 16:47.405
It's a joint venture. Mutual benefit.

16:47.485 --> 16:48.805
I cannot do this.

16:49.645 --> 16:52.205
Unless... Jacopo agrees.

16:53.205 --> 16:54.525
And he won't do that.

16:55.845 --> 16:57.645
Which is why I'm relying on your support.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.765
For the good of the Medici bank.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.125
For the good of Florence.

17:09.525 --> 17:11.725
[music playing]

17:15.604 --> 17:17.844
I didn't think you were celebrating.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.565
Uh... change of heart.

17:36.245 --> 17:38.365
[music continues]
Everything is going smoothly.

17:48.045 --> 17:49.325
You're worried for nothing.

17:49.405 --> 17:51.685
[Lorenzo] Medici and Pazzi united.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.245
Only my grandfather could have seen it.

17:54.325 --> 17:55.165
[chuckles]

17:56.085 --> 17:58.205
Well, now all you have to do...

17:58.565 --> 18:00.725
is to bring peace to the other states.

18:17.565 --> 18:20.045
I'm surprised Bianca invited
Lucrezia Donati.

18:21.485 --> 18:23.245
She didn't. I did.

18:23.565 --> 18:25.645
Her husband's an important ally.

18:29.285 --> 18:30.925
By all accounts,
it is your alliance with her

18:31.005 --> 18:32.605
and not to her husband
that is important to you.

18:37.045 --> 18:38.805
It's idle gossip, Clarice.

19:08.245 --> 19:09.485
Family meeting?

19:12.525 --> 19:13.845
[door closes]

19:14.645 --> 19:15.925
Ominous.

19:16.645 --> 19:18.165
The girl, Novella.

19:18.605 --> 19:19.925
What do you think of her?

19:20.565 --> 19:22.485
She is pretty enough. Why?

19:23.405 --> 19:25.525
I need Foscari to lobby the doge.

19:27.325 --> 19:29.805
He wants a husband for his daughter.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.525
Me?

19:32.725 --> 19:33.685
You must be joking.

19:33.765 --> 19:36.285
Lorenzo wouldn't ask this of you
if it wasn't important to Florence.

19:36.365 --> 19:37.725
How can you ask?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.885
You've seen how miserable
your own wife is?

19:45.765 --> 19:46.765
Hmm.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.125
Not a chance.

19:48.925 --> 19:50.285
I'll love who I wish.

19:50.805 --> 19:52.685
Thought you said
you didn't believe in love.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.245
[door opens]

20:00.965 --> 20:02.165
[door closes]

20:08.205 --> 20:09.165
There you are.

20:13.485 --> 20:16.045
Since when do you discuss
our affairs with Lorenzo?

20:16.125 --> 20:18.045
The offer benefits our bank.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.365
This is my bank.

20:19.685 --> 20:23.125
My brother and I hold my father's shares.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.165
And if your father were here now,

20:25.285 --> 20:26.645
he would tell you the same thing.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.805
But he's not.

20:28.325 --> 20:29.525
And we are.

20:30.405 --> 20:32.725
And together,
we hold the controlling interest.

20:34.325 --> 20:37.205
Young Medici throws scraps off his table.

20:37.285 --> 20:40.445
You lap them up
and pronounce yourself satisfied.

20:40.525 --> 20:42.325
This is not about the bank.

20:42.405 --> 20:45.365
This is about power!
We will not compromise.

20:45.805 --> 20:49.605
We will not negotiate.
We will wipe them out!

20:50.605 --> 20:53.325
And we will take our rightful place

20:53.405 --> 20:56.565
as Masters of Florence once and for all!

21:11.605 --> 21:13.205
[church bell rings]

21:14.725 --> 21:16.965
[people speaking indistinctly]

21:21.125 --> 21:23.645
[church bell chimes at a distance]
[inaudible chatter]

21:31.965 --> 21:33.885
Ma donna, Ardinghelli.

21:35.725 --> 21:37.325
[exhales] Ma donna, Medici.

21:37.405 --> 21:38.325
Ardinghelli.

21:38.405 --> 21:40.245
That is your husband's name,
is it not?

21:40.525 --> 21:41.725
Yes, indeed.

21:42.205 --> 21:43.925
Not yet had the pleasure of meeting him.

21:44.725 --> 21:48.325
Well, unfortunately, he's obliged
to travel a lot to the east

21:48.405 --> 21:49.925
for business reasons.

21:51.485 --> 21:53.885
Is that why you maintain
a relationship with my husband?

21:58.645 --> 22:02.005
You should discuss
your husband's relationships with him.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.365
What I discuss with Lorenzo
is none of your business.

22:09.605 --> 22:10.765
You're very beautiful.

22:13.805 --> 22:15.085
Far more...

22:15.285 --> 22:18.605
sophisticated than I am. I understand
why he is so captivated by you.

22:23.925 --> 22:24.965
Do you love him?

22:25.565 --> 22:27.285
My feelings are none of your business.

22:27.365 --> 22:28.765
If you love him, let him go.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.005
Lorenzo does not have a crown,
but he is king.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.125
A childless king, however,
is weak. His enemies...

22:38.525 --> 22:40.565
need only kill him
to destroy his kingdom.

22:42.325 --> 22:44.285
Only I can give him a legitimate heir.

22:44.365 --> 22:48.045
Only I can protect him. So I implore you,
if you love him, let him go.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.405
There is another thing
that makes a king weak.

22:53.725 --> 22:54.605
Loneliness.

22:56.645 --> 22:59.485
I have loved Lorenzo since he was 16.

23:00.725 --> 23:04.485
He was only a boy but I could already
see in him the man that he's becoming.

23:05.525 --> 23:06.845
Only I know him.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.445
Only I am close to him.

23:13.085 --> 23:15.125
Pushing him out of my bed...

23:15.965 --> 23:18.805
will not be enough
to bring him close to yours.

23:22.965 --> 23:24.325
Ma donna Medici.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.525
[sobbing]

23:40.245 --> 23:42.725
[continues to sob]

23:43.365 --> 23:44.925
[knocks on door]

23:47.445 --> 23:48.645
You all right?

23:49.245 --> 23:50.925
It's nothing, a cold. That's all.

23:56.885 --> 23:58.405
Well, if it's any consolation,

23:59.765 --> 24:02.685
it seems my brother wishes
unhappy marriages on both of us.

24:03.445 --> 24:04.405
Novella Foscari

24:05.005 --> 24:08.045
must marry the son
of a Florentine banking family.

24:08.765 --> 24:09.565
You.

24:11.525 --> 24:14.205
Things were much simple back
when my family were still wool merchants.

24:17.805 --> 24:18.725
Speak to him.

24:19.165 --> 24:20.525
I dare not.

24:22.245 --> 24:23.245
[sobbing]

24:24.365 --> 24:25.885
My brother is...

24:26.485 --> 24:27.965
many things.

24:29.685 --> 24:30.845
But he isn't heartless.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.405
[door closes]

24:44.685 --> 24:46.205
[Sandro] So as you can see,

24:47.165 --> 24:49.765
the shading is very flattering.

24:52.285 --> 24:53.605
Here the...

24:53.845 --> 24:55.485
Capitoline Venus...

24:57.405 --> 24:58.925
The Venus,

24:59.005 --> 25:00.285
of Apollodorus.

25:00.445 --> 25:01.685
They are naked.

25:01.925 --> 25:03.725
My husband...

25:04.045 --> 25:05.245
-I could not--
-Of course,

25:05.325 --> 25:07.165
of course.
These were merely ideas.

25:07.245 --> 25:08.725
You can be clothed. Anything.

25:08.845 --> 25:11.565
You're attempting to challenge yourself.

25:15.125 --> 25:16.125
Yes.

25:17.165 --> 25:18.125
[door opens]

25:18.445 --> 25:19.685
[Giuliano sighs]

25:21.245 --> 25:22.885
Where have you been?

25:23.085 --> 25:24.405
Better late than never.

25:24.485 --> 25:25.885
A matter of opinion.

25:26.605 --> 25:30.205
Giuliano, you will be Mars.

25:32.045 --> 25:35.085
In the scene Ovid describes, he rests.

25:35.365 --> 25:36.725
Beauty...

25:37.565 --> 25:39.365
has led him to love,

25:40.645 --> 25:42.805
which in turn has brought him peace.

25:44.485 --> 25:46.565
Now he's free to contemplate God.

25:52.645 --> 25:54.485
What do you think you're doing?

25:55.165 --> 25:56.885
The Gods don't wear clothes, do they?

26:05.085 --> 26:07.085
You made a promise before God.

26:10.925 --> 26:12.765
You're asking me to stop seeing Lucrezia.
[Clarice] I have asked nothing of you.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.805
But I do not deserve to be humiliated
before your servants,

26:19.885 --> 26:21.765
your family, and all of Florence.

26:21.965 --> 26:24.485
-Clarice, that was not my intention--
-Though that is the result.

26:27.805 --> 26:29.965
I can forego love but not respect.
Till I have that,
I will behave as the model wife,

26:34.005 --> 26:35.365
but my heart will remain closed

26:35.445 --> 26:37.325
so long as I have to share you
with that woman.

26:37.445 --> 26:38.765
[birds chirping]

26:39.405 --> 26:40.245
Cla-

26:41.805 --> 26:42.685
Clarice.

26:48.005 --> 26:51.645
From the moment we met,
you had my respect.

27:01.685 --> 27:02.885
[hawk chirping]

27:03.165 --> 27:04.005
[Giuliano] Lorenzo.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.525
Mother's with Luca Soderini at the Priori.
There's a problem.

27:14.205 --> 27:15.965
-What is it? What's happening?
-Show him.

27:16.325 --> 27:20.845
Receipts. Showing Volterrian alum
selling in Venice for two ducats per load.

27:20.925 --> 27:22.085
[Lucrezia]
They're deliberately undercutting

27:22.165 --> 27:23.765
the price the pope sells his alum.

27:24.805 --> 27:28.565
These, these don't show the name
of the merchant who's selling them.

27:29.445 --> 27:31.645
If the pope finds out about this,
he'll be forced to invade.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.245
Oh, Jacopo will make sure
that he finds out.

27:35.645 --> 27:36.565
When did you get these?

27:36.805 --> 27:38.965
Jacopo's showing them
to members of the Priori.

27:39.045 --> 27:40.245
He's insisting that the Medici

27:40.325 --> 27:42.405
be no longer allowed
to sell alum for Volterra.

27:42.485 --> 27:43.845
Right. Right.

27:44.525 --> 27:48.165
Someone in Volterra is striking deals
over more than one table.

27:49.845 --> 27:51.565
I will ask Maffei to root him out.

27:51.765 --> 27:53.325
No, there's no time for that.

27:53.685 --> 27:56.005
We must scare the Volterrians
into respecting their agreement.

27:57.565 --> 27:59.805
-With whose army?
-Sforza...

28:00.325 --> 28:01.885
will provide us with his.

28:02.205 --> 28:04.605
I promised the people of Volterra
that I'd protect them,

28:04.965 --> 28:06.565
not threaten them, Giuliano.

28:07.325 --> 28:08.805
Look, how far that's gotten you.

28:09.005 --> 28:11.365
I will ask Maffei to root the traitor out.

28:11.445 --> 28:12.725
What if he can't find him?

28:14.165 --> 28:15.165
He must.

28:15.765 --> 28:16.885
Whatever you say.

28:17.685 --> 28:18.685
I have an appointment.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.925
Have you thought more
about the marriage to Novella Foscari?

28:26.045 --> 28:27.605
You have my answer, Brother.

28:28.605 --> 28:29.445
Mother.

28:40.005 --> 28:41.645
I still taste your kiss.
It was a mistake.

28:45.485 --> 28:47.165
You can't look at me, can you?

28:48.805 --> 28:51.925
Go on. I dare you.

28:55.165 --> 28:56.085
See.

28:56.845 --> 28:59.125
I've seen quite enough. Thank you.

29:00.565 --> 29:03.325
Giuliano, Lie back.

29:03.885 --> 29:05.245
Contemplate God.

29:10.445 --> 29:12.965
Giuliano, eyes, close them.

29:13.045 --> 29:16.885
-Really?
-Search within yourself.

29:20.045 --> 29:20.965
No looking.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.205
I'd rather watch my husband
count his coins.

29:32.765 --> 29:34.845
Not looking at his chest.

29:36.005 --> 29:36.845
Above him.

29:39.485 --> 29:42.325
Your sister's wedding is over,
Messer Medici.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.165
I apologize, Messer Foscari.

29:45.245 --> 29:48.165
I had hoped to persuade my brother
to accept the match, but...

29:48.725 --> 29:49.525
he refuses.

29:50.885 --> 29:52.885
Then you have wasted my time.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.085
B-but perhaps there is something else
that I can do for you.

29:57.325 --> 29:59.365
I regret that I must
strongly discourage the doge

29:59.445 --> 30:01.445
from entering into any alliance
with Florence.

30:01.525 --> 30:05.165
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Messer Maffei
is in the study with your mother.

30:05.525 --> 30:06.765
She said it's very important.

30:06.845 --> 30:10.205
You clearly have more pressing matters
to attend to. Good day.

30:12.605 --> 30:13.965
Messer Foscari.

30:23.525 --> 30:25.325
Stefano, you bring news?

30:26.285 --> 30:29.765
The Priori of Volterra have ousted me
and elected Vaccari.

30:29.845 --> 30:31.805
They even rescinded
the agreement with your bank

30:32.125 --> 30:35.005
and made a deal with another merchant
on more favorable terms.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.725
The Pazzi are behind this.

30:40.445 --> 30:42.805
We must prove that that merchant
is being manipulated by Jacopo.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.245
There is no time.

30:44.325 --> 30:47.125
You must send in Sforza's army
and take the alum.

30:47.205 --> 30:48.885
No, no, no. I will not shed blood.

30:49.605 --> 30:50.525
There has to be another way.

30:50.605 --> 30:52.925
If you do not act now,
far more blood will be shed

30:53.045 --> 30:56.245
when the Pope is forced to send in
his soldiers to take Volterra by force.

30:56.805 --> 30:58.845
Volterra remains under our protection.

31:00.285 --> 31:01.485
No alum is to leave that city

31:01.565 --> 31:03.445
until Jacopo treachery has been proven,
you understand?

31:04.445 --> 31:08.245
Antonio and I shall ride back to Volterra
and inform them at once.

31:10.725 --> 31:12.645
[horse neighing]

31:34.245 --> 31:36.125
[indistinct chatter]

31:39.605 --> 31:41.645
[horse trotting]

31:45.965 --> 31:48.485
[man] The Medici assume
direct rule of our city.

31:48.885 --> 31:50.405
What now, Vaccari?

31:52.965 --> 31:55.645
[horse trotting]

31:59.365 --> 32:02.445
[footsteps approaching]

32:06.325 --> 32:07.765
What are you doing here?

32:11.525 --> 32:15.085
Do you remember the day that your uncle
came to fetch you and Guglielmo?

32:16.485 --> 32:18.125
I can never forget it.

32:19.325 --> 32:21.605
It felt like the sun
would never shine again.

32:21.685 --> 32:24.325
And yet all these years later it has.

32:26.085 --> 32:28.685
Your brother, my sister married.
[chuckles]

32:29.365 --> 32:31.205
Just as your parents would have wished.

32:36.765 --> 32:38.565
I need your help, Francesco.

32:40.805 --> 32:44.605
Find proof that your uncle is paying
someone to undercut me in Volterra.

32:47.605 --> 32:50.525
He raised me. He's my family.

32:51.245 --> 32:53.045
Now, I'm your family, too.

32:56.765 --> 32:58.845
It feels like a betrayal, I know.

32:59.925 --> 33:01.085
I know.

33:02.685 --> 33:05.925
But together we can, we can prevent a war.

33:07.005 --> 33:09.845
And save untold lives, Francesco.

33:15.645 --> 33:18.005
[bells tolling]

34:05.245 --> 34:06.925
She has talked to you also.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.765
You know my feelings for you.

34:11.125 --> 34:12.525
But she's my wife.

34:48.365 --> 34:49.885
Would you really deny me?

35:17.325 --> 35:19.965
Messer Foscari, thank you for coming.

35:21.405 --> 35:22.925
I wish to speak to you
about your daughter.

35:24.165 --> 35:27.685
Tell your husband the politics of Florence
are not my concern.

35:28.005 --> 35:30.365
-We leave for Venice in the morning.
-I do not speak for Lorenzo.

35:31.285 --> 35:32.725
Or for politics.

35:34.005 --> 35:36.725
I know a little of unhappiness
and I would spare your daughter the same.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.885
There is another son
of a Florentine banking family

35:42.965 --> 35:44.085
who would have your daughter's hand.
Lorenzo.

36:49.925 --> 36:50.965
Do you have it?

36:55.045 --> 36:59.125
The last name, he's the one selling alum
on my uncle's orders.

37:01.565 --> 37:02.725
Thank you, Francesco.

37:04.045 --> 37:06.045
Tell me it will do some good.

37:07.605 --> 37:12.085
Yes, if we can get him
to testify against Jacopo.

37:18.685 --> 37:21.565
[crickets chirping]

37:28.085 --> 37:31.925
Go on inside. Wash up, son.
I'll be right there.

37:40.805 --> 37:42.045
[clanging]

37:42.965 --> 37:43.845
[door jammed]

37:44.765 --> 37:46.325
[knocks rapidly on door]

37:47.325 --> 37:49.205
[groans]

37:59.765 --> 38:04.525
Tell Lorenzo de' Medici
Volterra does not take orders from him.

38:08.805 --> 38:10.605
Father, no.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.205
Maffei is murdered.

38:18.645 --> 38:21.045
-What?
-After posting your declaration.

38:21.565 --> 38:22.485
What should we do?

38:24.525 --> 38:26.885
[bell tolling]

38:30.125 --> 38:33.205
-[Jacopo] War!
-[all agreeing]

38:33.285 --> 38:35.205
The killings must end.

38:36.805 --> 38:38.805
If we do not react,

38:39.325 --> 38:44.565
every city will feel free
to butcher Florence's friends.

38:44.965 --> 38:46.765
Volterra must be punished!

38:46.885 --> 38:48.005
[all] Yes!

38:48.285 --> 38:49.725
[men shouting indistinctly]

38:49.885 --> 38:52.365
[Lorenzo] Gentlemen, please!

38:53.285 --> 38:55.485
Please, please!

38:58.645 --> 39:03.365
No one grieves more than I do
for Maffei's death.

39:05.045 --> 39:07.765
But more death is not the answer here.

39:07.965 --> 39:10.765
Will you listen to the man
who brought us to this?

39:10.845 --> 39:14.045
Why is he so desperate to avoid war?
-Are you scared, Lorenzo--
-Volterra was cheated, gentlemen.

39:18.205 --> 39:20.805
Strong words, young Medici.
Where is your proof?

39:21.965 --> 39:23.805
You give me time and I'll have it.

39:23.885 --> 39:26.965
And what if Maffei,
his blood is on your hands?

39:27.085 --> 39:29.005
Will you now deny him justice?

39:29.205 --> 39:30.285
Who's for war?

39:30.365 --> 39:33.245
[all cheering]

39:34.045 --> 39:38.525
Let us call upon the services
of the great condottieri Montefeltro

39:39.205 --> 39:42.125
and wash blood away with blood!

39:42.605 --> 39:44.925
-A vote!
-Gentlemen.

39:45.005 --> 39:46.405
[clamoring]

39:57.565 --> 39:58.925
[Lorenzo] The only way
we can stop this war

39:59.005 --> 40:01.325
is if you two find the merchant
that Jacopo paid.

40:01.725 --> 40:03.445
We need him to testify.

40:03.805 --> 40:04.845
Where are you going?

40:05.165 --> 40:07.565
Travel with the army,
make sure they stay their weapons.

40:07.645 --> 40:09.085
You'll do no such thing.

40:09.325 --> 40:12.125
The only way to save our bank is
if you get that evidence against Jacopo.

40:12.765 --> 40:13.925
I'll ride with the army.

40:15.725 --> 40:16.765
Giuliano...

40:18.765 --> 40:20.085
God bless and protect you.

40:21.325 --> 40:23.765
Messer Pazzi,
someone has been through our books.

40:24.365 --> 40:25.365
How do you know?

40:25.645 --> 40:28.885
This volume was not in the same place
where I left it last night.

40:29.565 --> 40:30.685
Let me see that.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.405
Thank you.

40:50.525 --> 40:53.045
-I need you to do something for me.
-[inaudible]

41:09.165 --> 41:11.445
-Time to begin the attack.
-Why the haste?

41:12.405 --> 41:14.805
With your army, reputation,
a few days' siege,

41:15.165 --> 41:16.005
they'll surrender.

41:16.605 --> 41:18.085
These men came here to fight.

41:18.765 --> 41:21.085
I keep them waiting
then they'll either desert

41:21.165 --> 41:22.645
or start murdering each other.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.645
[man] Come on, men, in formation.

41:31.525 --> 41:32.725
Move it. Quickly!

41:43.645 --> 41:45.245
[cart rattling]

-From Volterra, no doubt.

42:31.605 --> 42:32.685
We're too late.

42:34.205 --> 42:36.085
Your uncle must have known
he couldn't risk exposure.

42:36.165 --> 42:37.285
Then we have failed.

42:38.285 --> 42:40.085
We have to ride to Volterra, now.

42:42.005 --> 42:43.485
[horse neighing]

44:08.885 --> 44:09.725

44:13.005 --> 44:14.405
[Giuliano] We are victorious.

44:21.885 --> 44:23.205
It was a slaughter.

44:25.805 --> 44:27.885
[crowd cheering]

44:45.925 --> 44:48.205
[applause and cheering]

45:06.485 --> 45:07.965
I haven't the stomach for this.

45:14.805 --> 45:15.845
Giuliano!
Giuliano!

45:23.365 --> 45:24.445
[horse neighing]

45:40.365 --> 45:41.645
Thank God.

45:42.645 --> 45:43.885
[sighs]

46:23.965 --> 46:24.765
Francesco.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.805
Forgive me, Guglielmo. I'm weary.

46:29.645 --> 46:30.645
Humor me.

46:33.205 --> 46:34.885
Andrea Foscari.

46:48.525 --> 46:53.045
Your brother and I have been discussing
a union between our families.

47:12.445 --> 47:14.205
[horse trotting]

47:14.405 --> 47:15.725
Welcome back, Messer.

47:36.405 --> 47:38.125
[door creaking]

48:17.005 --> 48:18.685
You should be with the others celebrating.

48:21.725 --> 48:22.965
I wish to be with you.

48:27.845 --> 48:29.485
I saw a messenger leaving.

48:31.405 --> 48:32.325
Yes.

48:32.805 --> 48:36.285
It was a letter from Francesco Pazzi.
Thanking me.

48:37.365 --> 48:38.165
For what?

48:39.205 --> 48:41.805
He is to marry Novella Foscari.

48:42.925 --> 48:44.365
I suggested it to her father.

48:45.245 --> 48:46.165
You?

48:48.005 --> 48:49.845
I see how taken they were with each other

48:51.525 --> 48:53.725
and how important Foscari's support
was to you.

49:02.085 --> 49:04.445
I failed, Clarice, I failed.

49:06.085 --> 49:08.165
By trying to seek peace, I brought war.

49:08.245 --> 49:10.405
By trying to save lives, I lost them.

49:11.205 --> 49:13.925
There's... There's blood on my hands.

49:14.005 --> 49:15.285
You sought peace.

49:15.365 --> 49:17.285
Doesn't matter what I sought.

49:21.645 --> 49:23.285
You surprise me, Lorenzo.

49:24.885 --> 49:29.085
With all your education,
your fine books and philosophy.

49:31.725 --> 49:35.725
God does not judge us
by the outcome of our actions.

49:37.005 --> 49:38.925
He judges us by what is in our hearts.

49:41.285 --> 49:44.285
Your heart was, and...

49:45.085 --> 49:46.365
and remains pure.

49:48.045 --> 49:50.925
-It doesn't change what happened.
-Nothing can ever change what happened.

49:52.725 --> 49:55.125
We must mourn and...

49:56.365 --> 49:58.205
honor those whose lives were lost.

49:59.805 --> 50:02.485
If God forgives you, Lorenzo,
then you must forgive yourself.

50:15.525 --> 50:16.965
I've been a fool.

50:24.965 --> 50:27.525
I'm privileged to call you my wife.
