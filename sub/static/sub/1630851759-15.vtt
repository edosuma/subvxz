19:27.750 --> 19:29.001
Sydney.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.172
I assume you got my email.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.008
Yes, I did. Why didn't
you tell me in person?

19:36.634 --> 19:39.220
I'm sorry. I couldn't face you.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.305
I convinced you
to give me this job,

19:41.305 --> 19:42.556
and then I couldn't
even deliver.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.600
So, you quit?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.812
See? This is why I had
to do it in an email.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.981
I knew how disappointed
you'd be in me
that I let you down.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.775
I'm not disappointed
you quit the job, Syd.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.819
I'm disappointed you
quit on yourself.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.196
‐What do you mean?
‐You gave up.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.490
But I didn't. I never once
doubted that you could write

19:59.490 --> 20:02.076
an absolutely great jingle
for the bike shop.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.786
You're just saying that
because you're my dad,

20:03.786 --> 20:05.246
and you're trying to
make me feel better.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.081
(beep)

20:07.081 --> 20:08.457
Hold on. I gotta
turn up the radio.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.334
Aren't we kind of in
the middle of something here?

20:11.085 --> 20:13.587

That's the jingle
I wrote yesterday!

20:35.317 --> 20:37.278
‐Sure is!
‐But how?

20:37.278 --> 20:39.321
Olive sent it to me,
and I loved it so much,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.031
I wanted to get it on
the air as soon as I could.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.660
Wow. Now, I'm even more
embarrassed that I quit.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.953
Shouldn't have
given up on myself.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.621
Syd, part of being
a professional

20:47.621 --> 20:49.415
is making mistakes
and learning from them.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.250
And luckily, you have
a very sympathetic boss

20:51.250 --> 20:52.793
who's made mistakes, too.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.961
Thanks, Dad.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.089
Thank you for
the awesome jingle.
And I believe...

20:58.632 --> 21:00.176
I owe you this.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.473
OMG!

21:05.473 --> 21:08.309
My first paycheck
as a songwriter!

21:08.309 --> 21:09.935
It's so pretty,
I wanna frame it!

21:09.935 --> 21:11.437
I had a feeling you might.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.982
So I had a copy framed.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.235
Here you go, Ms. Reynolds.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.154
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

these customers.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.834
Your jingle is crushing it!

21:33.834 --> 21:35.836
Jingles can be very persuasive.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.339
I have to remember to
use my powers for good.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.340
Hm.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.052
Hey, Grandma, you're back.
How was your boring conference?

21:43.052 --> 21:44.804
It was a total fake‐out.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.680
It was actually a surprise
party to thank me

21:46.680 --> 21:48.849
for all the hard work
I've done for my sorority.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.518

So, while I was away,

22:14.250 --> 22:16.585
you wrote an amazing
