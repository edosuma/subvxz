[Zoe] <i>They say you have to get back</i>

00:40.920 --> 00:43.520
<i>What they don't say is
you have to get back on the horse</i>

<i>that bolted with you
at a zillion miles an hour,</i>

00:45.960 --> 00:47.520

00:48.240 --> 00:49.720
<i>I guess it's less catchy.</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
Ready?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.800
Yeah, can we take it slowly?

00:57.440 --> 00:59.160
Who are you and what have you done
with Zoe?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.360
- Please?
- Sure.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.240
Don't look so worried.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.600
Let's start with a walk around, hmm?

01:12.880 --> 01:13.880
That's it.

01:14.720 --> 01:15.880
Take him for a walk.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.000
Jump on, canter,
and hop over that meter-high fence there.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
I'm kidding.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.640
Ugh. Marcus. [chuckles]

01:22.920 --> 01:25.560
We're going to get you comfortable
around Raven again.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.600
You just need to start from the beginning.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.160
First your horse, now Marcus.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.520
Is there no stopping that girl?

01:37.160 --> 01:39.240
Darcy's really dirty, don't you think?

01:39.920 --> 01:43.160
- I only groomed her this morning.
- Well, you've done a dreadful job.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.680
I think Darcy needs a bath.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.680
- How's that feeling?
- Good. I think. [chuckles]

01:54.120 --> 01:56.600
- [whinnying]
- [Zoe grunts]

01:56.680 --> 01:58.960
- Oops. Sorry!
- What the hell, Mia?

02:02.160 --> 02:05.120
- It was an accident.
- You know he doesn't like water.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
You okay?

02:10.120 --> 02:11.160
I just need a minute.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.240
[Mia] He probably just picked up
on your nerves.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.800
He gets like that around beginners.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.880
Let me know when you want
to try again, Zoe.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.280
That wasn't helpful.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.040
I said sorry, didn't I?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.000
I was just distracted.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.160
I haven't been able to focus
since Firefly was stolen.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.000
Maybe being a cover girl
will cheer me up.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.440
- Is the magazine out today?
- Yeah.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.040
Daddy's even more excited about it
than I am.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.400
He canceled this huge meeting
on the mainland

02:42.480 --> 02:44.320
just to take me out for lunch. [chuckles]

02:44.400 --> 02:47.600
That's typical Daddy.
He's always putting me first.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.080
You're happy for me, aren't you?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.480
Guys, I'll just get Raven...

03:02.560 --> 03:04.680
"On quiet nights when the moon is waning,

03:05.120 --> 03:08.760
listen for the trit trot of the hooves
as the Ghost Pony appears,

03:09.200 --> 03:11.160
looking for its lost master,

03:11.720 --> 03:13.840
waiting for his soul to be released."

03:14.520 --> 03:18.200
[sighs] I should put these into albums.
Keep them safe.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.880
[scoffs]
Don't you have them backed up online?

03:22.440 --> 03:24.040
[chuckles] These are from before online.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.360
There's a before online?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.120
It means they're very precious.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.920
Emerald's the Ghost Pony? No way.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
Zoe, you got a sec?

03:55.800 --> 03:59.080
[sighs] I know. I know, I totally blew it.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.400
What kind of a rider can't even stand
next to a horse?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.960
Hey, it's okay. It's okay to be scared.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.560
Uh, Zoe. I was actually thinking, uh...

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
Were you...

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
Are you...

04:13.360 --> 04:14.960
[stutters] The dance...

04:15.920 --> 04:18.520
- You going with anyone?
- Yup.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.880
- Oh.
- Jade and Becky.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.440
Oh. Right, well, the thing is...

04:24.520 --> 04:26.440
We figured it'd be better to go
with friends.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.480
I mean, who wants to go to a dance
with, you know, a date

04:29.560 --> 04:32.760
and annoy everybody
with how cute you are together, right?

04:35.720 --> 04:37.120
Guess I'll see you there then.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.440
[Zoe gasps]

04:40.520 --> 04:42.000
Oh. Hey, guys.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.680
- Hey?
- Hey.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.200
Is that all you can say?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.480
Look at her. She has no idea.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.400
What? What happened?

04:57.480 --> 05:00.120
Hot Marcus just totally asked you
to the dance is what happened.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.320
[sighs] No, he didn't.
He's going with Mia. I saw him kiss her

05:03.400 --> 05:06.600
after she deliberately splashed water
on Raven to make him freak out.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.280
Mia must know Marcus likes you.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.520
Guys, Mia has a problem with me
because of Raven, not Marcus.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.120
- Raven's got issues.
- Big-time.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.920
I can't ride him until I figure out
what his problem is.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.120
I think Ted and Pin know more
than they're saying.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.320
Yeah, well, it is weird that Pin
never told you he owned Raven.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.320
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.360
Pin's an enigma wrapped in a mystery,
wrapped in a... tortilla.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.680
Hmm. [gasps] Mystery tortilla.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.480
Maybe if we stop treating Pin
like an outsider,

05:33.560 --> 05:34.960
he'll stop acting like one.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.600
You should ask him to the barn dance.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.600
- [both chuckling]
- As if. Pin never comes to the dance.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.440
Well, maybe he should.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.320
[chuckles] I mean,
the guy needs to loosen up.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.280
I feel sorry for him being stuck out
on the moors with his dad,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.280
- being all moody.
- Thinking about you.

05:50.360 --> 05:55.080
Pin is a friend. A friend who knows more
about Raven than he's telling us.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.760
You said we were going for lunch together.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.680
I know, but James invited me to his house
in the country for a few days.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.560
It's golf, isn't it? Again.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.880
But you promised.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.040
I'll tell you what, keep the reservation
at the restaurant. Take Susie.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.080
And here.
Buy a few dozen copies of that magazine.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.720
I want to show everyone my cover girl.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.280
[engine starts]

06:29.360 --> 06:30.360
Bye-bye.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
Are you okay?

06:41.920 --> 06:44.160
- Of course.
- We'll still have fun.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.120
I've always wanted to go to Chez Elle.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.920
Oh. I don't really think
it's your kind of place, Susie.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.480
Anyway, I've got a much better idea.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.720
Come on. Let's go shopping.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.640
I didn't hear a horse.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.920
I walked.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
How's he doing?

07:17.560 --> 07:20.680
He's off his food.
I'm really worried about him.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.280
Pin...

07:34.920 --> 07:36.200
where is Raven from?

07:36.880 --> 07:37.880
No idea.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.400
I know you owned him
when he was a foal.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.200
- So?
- So, why didn't you tell me?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.760
[Pin] Are you accusing me of something?
Again?

07:48.840 --> 07:50.080
[Zoe] No, I'm really not.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.360
But what I don't get

07:52.440 --> 07:55.440
is why you're still keeping stuff from me.
I thought we were friends.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.840
Why would you be friends with me
when I'm clearly up to no good?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.840
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't need to.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.080
Just go, Zoe.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.800
I think you and me need
to have a little chat.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.920
That is... so gross.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, hello there, fair lady.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.480
- Couldn't keep away?
- I need someone's help with this.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.200
Who can tell me about Ghost Pony?

08:49.080 --> 08:51.360
I know just the person. Follow me.

08:51.440 --> 08:55.320
So, would you say his mane was long
and scraggly, or pristine and well kept?

08:55.400 --> 08:56.400
Long and scraggly.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.280
He has this death stare
that can turn any person into stone...

08:59.320 --> 09:04.040
And would you say he would roam the moors
or is he more likely to be seen in town?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.000
- Can you stop encouraging her?
- The moors.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.640
Although Kitty Walsh swears she saw him
in the supermarket once.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.920
Which is why she totally forgot
to pay for her shopping.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.440
A likely story.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
Well?

09:16.520 --> 09:17.880
The description fits.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.480
No way!

09:20.560 --> 09:22.000
G.P.'s in an actual book!

09:22.640 --> 09:24.000
And a photograph?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
It's okay.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.480
I know who the Ghost Pony is
and how to get rid of him.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.680
But first, my gramps told me
to speak to this man.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.920
Edward Hawthorne, where can I find him?

09:38.040 --> 09:39.680
We'd had storms for weeks...

09:40.480 --> 09:42.760
so on the first calm day,
I went down to the beach

09:42.840 --> 09:44.520
to see what the sea had washed up.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.600
Never thought I'd come back with a foal.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.040
Raven.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.960
- I told Pin not to name him.
- Everyone needs a name.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.000
I thought someone would turn up
looking for him, but they didn't.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.160
When he bolted, he took me to the beach.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Tell her.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.080
This crate... was washed up
near where I found him.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.480
We think he came to the island inside it.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.000
[whinnies]

10:14.880 --> 10:17.920
No wonder he's afraid of water.
Imagine being in here, in the sea.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.640
It's amazing he has the courage
to do anything at all.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.840
I never planned on selling him.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.840
But Elliot made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.720
It was a hard time for Peter and me.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.480
The money helped.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.320
So, now you know.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.280
You lied for your dad.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.040
I didn't want to cause any trouble
for him. Didn't want to hurt him.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.480
- You wouldn't understand.
- But I do.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.880
I do. I... I guess you don't always know
what people have been through.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
[pony chewing]

10:58.440 --> 10:59.480
[chuckles]

11:06.240 --> 11:08.600
- Susie, be careful.
- Sorry, Mia.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.680
- Oh, my goodness.
- What?

11:13.240 --> 11:16.160
That woman is reading
<i>Pony People</i> magazine. It's out!

11:16.240 --> 11:17.800
- Mia.
- What?

11:17.880 --> 11:20.080
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact

11:20.160 --> 11:21.880
that you might not be on the cover.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.480
What?

11:23.560 --> 11:26.200
The photographer was awfully interested
in Zoe that day.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.520
Zoe won't be on the cover.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.480
But if she is, she'll be sorry.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.640
- Excuse me, can I just...
- Um...

11:38.560 --> 11:39.720
Get me my phone.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.400
Why aren't you riding?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.800
Um... I am.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.960
- I mean, I plan to.
- Are you scared?

11:47.640 --> 11:48.640
Maybe.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.440
But knowing who Raven is will really help.

11:52.080 --> 11:56.720
He's been through so much,
and if he can be brave... I can, too.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.640
Anyway, I'll see you later, Peter.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.080
- That's your name, right?
- Only my dad calls me that.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.560
Oh, so, Pin's a nickname?

12:07.640 --> 12:09.520
- What does it mean?
- It's not a nickname.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.360
It's my name.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
Pin it is.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.960
[Mia] I want to know who
this random girl is and what's going on.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
But then who...

12:26.160 --> 12:27.160
I see...

12:28.720 --> 12:30.480
- Okay.
- What did they say?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.200
Something really weird is going on.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.720
- [neighs]
- I know.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.600
I know what happened to you.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.320
But I'm never gonna let anyone hurt you
ever again.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.920
I swear.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
Never again.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.360
Do you think she'll tell anyone?

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
I know she won't.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.120
[Rosie] Tedward Hawthorne?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.600
Who's asking?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
Rosie Phillips.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.280
- Maggie's daughter.
- Another one?

13:10.360 --> 13:12.480
Save me from the Steel girls.

[Marcus] Hey.

You're back.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.480
I want to train on him properly.
To start at the beginning,

13:25.560 --> 13:28.280

to the county show. Then I want to stop

13:28.360 --> 13:30.240
and probably sit in an ice bath.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.760
Hmm. Okay.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.840
- But this time, we're following the rules.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.560
Well, if you would have stuck
to the rules in the first place...

You are unbelievable.

Little idea. Let's pretend
this whole water-jump thing doesn't exist.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.760
There's a water jump
in the county show, Zoe.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.400
[scoffs] We're the alternates.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.440
Be ready just in case. If you're chosen
on the day and you can't do it,

16:10.240 --> 16:11.560
This is the place, Maggie.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.600
- It's where Ted buried him.
- [Maggie] This is where Emerald is?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.520
Mom, Emerald is your horse.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.680
- He was.
- But now he's a ghost pony.

Seeking revenge.

I think what Rosie's trying to say...

If you don't say goodbye
to your horse properly, then...

16:35.160 --> 16:37.200
Then you'll never set his spirit free.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.400
We'll all be doomed.

You should see it in the spring.
It's all yellow with buttercups.

Emerald loved buttercups.

I know I hurt you.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
You did.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.160
But maybe it's better for all of us
if we just let that go.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.880
Okay, people.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.280

been laid to rest.

so is the Ghost Pony.

Guess what.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.280
I stopped at the office.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.320
My secretary gave me a copy
of your magazine.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.160
Where are you?

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
I'm not on the cover.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.840
Oh. Oh!

18:37.280 --> 18:39.400
- I told all my people you were.
- There was a mix-up.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.520
I called the magazine
and they've never heard of Bright Fields.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.320
- Wait, what?
- The photographer was a fake.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.440
I know you're upset. You thought
you were gonna be on that cover.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.880
We need to find out who he was.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.760
He could've been part
of the horse thieves.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.360
Oh, don't start, Zoe.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760

of your crackpot theories.

- First of all, Mia, what I'm gonna need...
- Hang on.

Now, Mia, Zoe's right.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.360
It is strange.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.200
I'll ask Derek to look into it.
See what he makes of it.

- Again. Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

I didn't get the cover,
but there's something else I want.

And I'm not gonna let him get away.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

That's Grandma's handwriting.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.120
[sighs] Mom had a tough time, didn't she?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
She did.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.640
And she held onto that hurt
for a very long time.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.640
But, thanks to you,
the light is coming on through.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
Mom can move on.

Rosie... what is it?

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
Nothing, it's...

20:14.240 --> 20:17.240
It's just that Mom seemed awfully pleased

20:17.320 --> 20:19.200
to see that Tedward guy again,
don't you think?

20:19.280 --> 20:21.680
[groans] Rosie,
we've been through this before.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.160
Mom is not gonna run off
with some other guy.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.040
- She just needs space.
- She has space, Zoe.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.080
[sighs] And time.

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
She'll get there.

I haven't ridden outside the arena yet.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.480
Zoe, I've been watching you.
You're ready. I know you are.

- Wait, I...
- Ah.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.800
- You're worried you're not gonna keep up.
- Uh-uh.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.320
No, you're gonna eat my dust.

Come on, then.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.640
Prove it.

When I was little...

21:57.200 --> 21:58.520
I couldn't say "Peter."

21:59.440 --> 22:01.640
So, my mom called me "Pin."

22:04.440 --> 22:08.280
She left when I was five, but by then
I wouldn't answer to anything else.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.640
My name's kind of all I have left of her.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.560
Where did she go?

22:17.760 --> 22:18.760
Don't know.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.560
Dad said he always knew
that she'd run away, but...

22:23.760 --> 22:24.920
still broke his heart.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.880
Is that why you stay away? It's safer?

22:34.120 --> 22:37.840
Well... who wants to be safe? [chuckles]

22:37.920 --> 22:40.040
Come to the barn dance tomorrow night.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.800
Come on. Come and be with people.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.080
Be with me.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.800
Yeah. All right.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.320
Let's go.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.760

or Ghost Pony's gonna get you.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.400
What are you still doing here?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.440
Checking what time
you're picking me up tomorrow.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.240
- Tomorrow?
- For the barn dance, silly.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.640
Uh-oh. Serious face.

23:25.720 --> 23:29.000
Listen, about tomorrow,
I was thinking of asking someone else.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.200
I heard Zoe's asking Pin.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.360
Did I say anything about Zoe?

23:35.920 --> 23:38.520
No, I just thought it was funny.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.960
I mean, can you imagine? [chuckles]

23:43.120 --> 23:45.680
Marcus... don't be difficult.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.760
Everyone's expecting us to go together.

Now that Zoe's going with Pin,

23:50.720 --> 23:54.240
- there's really no reason not to...
- This isn't about Zoe. It's about you.

You've changed, Mia.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.720
That water thing with Raven the other day,
it's not cool.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.960
I'd rather go on my own than go with you.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
Oh.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.200
Well... maybe it'll be more fun
if we go as a group.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.240
- She's doing it again.
- Doing what?

24:17.600 --> 24:19.000
Can't you see it, Susie?

24:19.720 --> 24:22.640
Everything that I've got, Zoe wants.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.160
She's... She's toxic!

24:26.760 --> 24:28.200
What are you gonna do about it?

24:28.280 --> 24:30.000
Give her a taste of her own medicine.
