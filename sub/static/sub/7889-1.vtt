<i>[woman]
Publications like Rolling Stone and Spare Rib</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:48.011
were created to feed the need

00:48.173 --> 00:52.019
for alternative narratives from the
established newspapers of the day.

00:52.177 --> 00:56.432
In much the same way, the Pauper <i>Press</i>
of the 1790s in England was developed

00:56.598 --> 00:59.727
out of a need for mass representation
for the popular classes.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.818
Those magazines and fanzines
of the '60s and '70s also provided

01:03.981 --> 01:05.858
a means of reaching
beyond the official

01:06.024 --> 01:09.449
and thus, ultimately,
beyond the ruling classes.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.737
The Internet, in contrast,

01:10.904 --> 01:13.248
no longer requires there to be
any notion of the group.

01:13.865 --> 01:17.290
Its concern is wholly
with the individual.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.040
It is with lucrative serendipity,
or perhaps just good branding,

01:21.206 --> 01:23.004
that Myspace is so called.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.589
The juxtaposition suggests
that the act of the individual

01:25.752 --> 01:28.596
in defining their cyberspace
borders is more important

01:28.755 --> 01:31.679
than what it is filled with.
It is simply 'your space.'.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.015
For the end of monetized
mass communication

01:34.177 --> 01:37.181
is the end of the press baron
champagne baths.

01:38.265 --> 01:42.611
[man] Thank you, Anna.
Very provocative. Well done.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.240
Does anyone else
have a presentation to make?

01:46.398 --> 01:49.151
[students chattering]

01:49.318 --> 01:52.697
[man] All right, make sure you turn
in your final packet to Jacob.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.831
And thank you very much.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.412
Hi.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.378
I don't need to give you mine,
because I've already done it.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.962
[Jacob] Cool.
- Cool.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.216
[chuckles]

02:53.382 --> 02:55.976
If she comes to invite
wearing the same dress as me,

02:56.134 --> 02:59.388
- I will completely freak out!
- Hey, yeah... yeah.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.807
No, it was OK.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.983
It was fine.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.279
<i>[woman] Sweetheart,
I really miss you so much.</i>

03:15.445 --> 03:16.788
Mum, can you just...

03:16.947 --> 03:19.700
I'll speak to you in a minute. I have
someone waiting on the other line.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.459
<i>All right, darling. I miss you.</i>

03:21.618 --> 03:23.291
- <i>I love you.</i>
- <i>OK, OK, OK, bye</i>

03:23.453 --> 03:24.830
[phone beeps]

03:27.708 --> 03:30.587
- Hello?
[man] Hi, Anna?

03:30.752 --> 03:33.050
<i>- It's Jacob.
- Hi.</i>

03:40.220 --> 03:42.063
[Anna] It didn't freak you out?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.188
I guess you wouldn't
be here if it had.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.229
No, it was nice.
And it was funny.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.275
It was kind of great. I don't think
you're a nutcase, by the way, at all.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.318
I thought I'd better
put that, just in case.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.829
- That was a good disclaimer.
- Yeah, I just wanted to set that out.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.082
- "No nutcases here."
- Yeah.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.208
[laughs]
- Whoa.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.753
These cups are huge.
They're like reservoirs.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.715
It's almost bigger
than my face. [giggles]

04:15.213 --> 04:17.591
Yeah, so what do you...
What's your major?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.851
Furniture design.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.808
That's why you're always drawing.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.439
Yeah. You like to write then?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.692
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

04:26.850 --> 04:30.946
journalism is probably what I
would want to kind of go into

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
when I graduate. I don't know.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.779
Who knows what we're going
to do when we leave.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.788
You mean permanently when we leave?
Like when we're dead? We'll be dead.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.370
[laughs] When we leave.
When we depart this planet.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.911
[both laugh]

04:58.799 --> 05:01.018
So are you going to
stay in LA after school?

05:01.176 --> 05:04.555
Yeah, I'd like to,
if I can sort out my visa stuff.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.642
So you grew up with
your mum and dad?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.153
- My mom.
- And your dad?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.279
He passed away when I was ten.

05:13.438 --> 05:17.693
[Anna] Now, that's shitty.
- Yeah. It's quite shitty.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.038
And what about you?

05:22.197 --> 05:24.746
Yeah, my parents,
I'm very close to them.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.502
It's only ever been...
I'm an only child, so...

05:27.661 --> 05:29.504
Me, too.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.126
Yeah, so I'm quite close to them.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.044
But it's nice being away.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.464
I think it's important to...

05:38.630 --> 05:42.976
to get away from where you've
grown up for some of your life.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.184
I was thinking about
leaving right now, actually.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.852
[laughs]

05:53.520 --> 05:55.363
Let's go.
Where do you want to go?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.952
Um, do you want to come up?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.865
[whispering] She likes
to go to bed early.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.329
Oh, no, that's terrible!

06:07.492 --> 06:10.541
So I try not to make too much noise.
Do you want a drink?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.377
I only have whiskey.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.758
Yeah.

06:17.627 --> 06:22.474
- I don't drink much... actually.
[liquid pours]

06:23.675 --> 06:25.052
Cheers.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.985
[exhales deeply] [chuckles]

06:34.144 --> 06:36.146
- It's strong. [laughs]
- Mm.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.527
- Is that the chair where you write?
- Yeah.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.997
It's not very comfortable.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.331
[laughs] It does the job.

06:51.786 --> 06:55.507
- You like Paul Simon?
- Yeah.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.544
- Do you?
- Yeah, I love Paul Simon.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.838
- Really?
- Yeah, I love Graceland.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.972
[laughs] Oh!

07:03.131 --> 07:05.429
- It's so good.
- That's my favorite album.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.765
[♪ Paul Simon: "Crazy Love, Vol. ll"]

07:09.804 --> 07:11.681
Would you mind reading me something?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.609
What do you want me to read?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.188
Something you wrote.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.785
OK.

07:27.656 --> 07:31.081
- You're not allowed to laugh.
- I'm not gonna laugh.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.831
I haven't read it out loud yet.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.301
So you'll be the first person.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.676
- You sure you want to hear it?
- Mmmm.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.143
"I thought I understood it."

07:48.301 --> 07:50.520
That I could grasp it.
But I didn't.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.805
Not really.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.316
Only the 'smudgeness' of it.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.230
The pink-slippered, all-containered,
semi-precious eagerness of it.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.654
I didn't realize it would
sometimes be more than whole.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.994
That the wholeness
was a rather luxurious idea.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.535
Because it's the halves
that halve you in half.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.002
Didn't know. Don't know
about the in-between bits.

08:17.163 --> 08:22.044
"The gory bits of you
and gory bits of me."

08:23.962 --> 08:26.306
I like "the halves
that halve you in half."

08:26.464 --> 08:30.344
[giggles] It's a bit childish.
- No.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.229
No.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.558
[music continues softly in background]

09:01.249 --> 09:03.251
[laughs]

09:07.589 --> 09:10.513
Bye.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.878
[♪ soft piano music]

10:01.351 --> 10:04.400
[music continues, no audio]

11:02.328 --> 11:05.172
[doorbell rings] [Anna shouts]

11:05.331 --> 11:09.381
- Hello, darling!
[squeals] Oh, my darling!

11:09.544 --> 11:12.093
- I know! Hello!
- All right, enough of that.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.973
Now, let's have a hug.
Come on now.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.931
[all laughing]
- "Go! Wait!"

11:18.553 --> 11:20.100
[man] It's just the "L's."

11:20.263 --> 11:22.982
[both speaking gibberish]

11:23.141 --> 11:24.563
[woman] He's a baker.
In fact...

11:24.726 --> 11:26.273
[Anna] Did you bring me some bread?

11:26.436 --> 11:27.983
- I did.
- He did!

11:28.146 --> 11:30.399
- He packed it in his suitcase.
[Anna] It's so good.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.067
[woman] He was baking yesterday.
[man] Straight from the oven.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.281
It's probably warmed all my shirts.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.492
You're... you're...
you're being...

11:36.654 --> 11:38.656
Oh, for God's sake!

11:38.823 --> 11:41.918
Bernard, stop it. This is something
I just have to ask. I'm sorry.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.249
- We're very open in our house.
- You don't have to answer.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.380
- We're not that open. We are not.
- We are!

11:46.539 --> 11:49.884
We talk... You may not be open,
but Anna and I are.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.638
We talk about everything. I'm sorry.
I have to tell you this right now.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.174
So don't be embarrassed.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.094
You are being grown up?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.557
- You are being adults?
[laughs]

12:00.720 --> 12:02.518
[Bernard] You do not have to answer.
[Anna] Yes.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.524
Thank you. That's all I needed
to know. That's perfect.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.937
Jacob, do you like whiskey?
Just to change the subject completely.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.652
- That is a very good idea.
- I'm learning. Anna's been teaching me.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.533
She's an expert. Of course,
she learned from the master.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.740
What's your favorite
that we've tried?

12:18.571 --> 12:21.120
- La... Laphroaig.
[Bernard] Laphroaig!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.284
- I love Laphroaig. It's my favorite.
- She does.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.079
- It's great.
[Bernard] That's very sophisticated.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.839
- Drive safe. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.338
Bye.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.258
<i>[Jacob] OK. Close your eyes.
[Anna] Why?</i>

12:38.424 --> 12:39.846
Because. Close your eyes.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.477
[laughs]
- Close your eyes.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.263
Close them. Count to 60.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.738

I can open them now?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.781
I can sense you've
brought something.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.182
Thank you. Thank you.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.518
- It's my chair.
- Mmmm.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.142
Look underneath.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.121
It's your first one.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.534
I love you...

like crazy.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.679
[whispering] What are we going
to do after we graduate?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.313
We... We'll sort something out.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.982
Don't think about it now.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.769
I'll come back
and I'll get a work visa.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.023
I hate thinking about it.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.823
I'm not gonna leave.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.080
- Promise.
- OK.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.705
Yeah. Yeah.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.087
<i>[mother] Sweetheart, you all packed?
[Anna] Yeah, pretty much.</i>

14:35.249 --> 14:38.128
I just can't believe it's tomorrow.
The time's gone so quickly.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.137
<i>You certainly left it
to the last minute.</i>

14:40.296 --> 14:41.923
Well, it's difficult,
because I won't see Jacob

14:42.090 --> 14:44.343
- for the whole summer, so...
- How's he doing?

14:44.509 --> 14:46.511
He's good.
He's just in the shower.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.772
He's got his website up and running,
so he's pleased about that.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.604
<i>Darling, I know
you're going to miss him.</i>

14:51.766 --> 14:54.815
Yeah, I just wish I could
stay a bit longer, that's all.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.277
<i>Anna, darling, Dad told you what the
lawyer said about overstaying the visa.</i>

14:58.439 --> 14:59.816
<i>This is important.
You know that.</i>

14:59.982 --> 15:02.235
Yeah, I know.
Those are the rules.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.245
<i>We'll get things sorted
over the summer.</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:06.247
<i>Then you can go back to LA
after Sarah's wedding.</i>

15:06.406 --> 15:08.659
Yeah, I know. So, um...

15:08.825 --> 15:11.044
I'll see you tomorrow, Mum.
I'd better get going.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.125
<i>Yeah, we can't wait.
We can't wait!</i>

15:13.287 --> 15:14.789
Yeah. Bye, Mum.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.804
Are they excited
that you're coming back?

15:21.963 --> 15:25.092
[Anna] Yeah, they can't wait.
My mum is very excited.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.647
Mm. I'm glad that we're
getting away for a...

15:30.805 --> 15:31.977
for a night.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.642
But we'll come back here
on the way back,

15:33.808 --> 15:36.061
- before I go to the airport?
- Yeah.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.023
- What time is the boat?
- 10:30.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.784
- We haven't got that much time.
- Don't worry. It's OK.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.320
I'm not worried.

- What happened? You OK?
- Ow! Yeah.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.792

- Let me see.

We should be with each other.

for us to get married...

- just a few months ago, yes?
[Anna] Yes.

59:42.788 --> 59:46.258
Well, I want to tell you
that I don't doubt the authenticity

59:46.416 --> 59:51.638
of your relationship. However, what is
at issue... I see here...

59:52.547 --> 59:55.141
four, is it, appeals.

59:55.300 --> 59:59.350
These are the official documents dealing
with the violation of the student visa.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:02.813
And this imposed a ban.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:08.026
And that, unfortunately is the...
comes down to the reason

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:12.989
that I can't process your application
for marriage visa, nor lift the ban.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.700
It has to come from
the student visa office.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:20.117
Yeah, but we've already applied several
times throughout the last couple years,

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:23.708
as you can see. So I don't know how
many times you expect us to do it.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.338
I mean, I don't know how...

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:26.965
We were told...
I was told by my lawyer

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:30.048
that this would be dealt
with separately

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.963
from the visa violation,
which is why we're here.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.178
- We've appealed four times.
[woman] He was misinformed.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.934
- That is what is in the way.
- This is a separate situation.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.222
Then I want to know who he spoke to,
because we speak to someone different

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.061
- every single time.
[Anna] Should there not be one person

with our particular application?

process this right now,

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:53.742

as I get a lift on the ban.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.673
[Anna] Did you want to see me?
- Yes.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:08.176
I wanted to know how my new
junior editor was doing.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.972
[laughing]

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.259

- Oh, I'm deaf.

- I shouted in your ear.
- Yes.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.734
- Hello.
[Simon] Hello.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:32.366
- How are you? [chuckles]
- I'm all right.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.660
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.662
- What's so funny'?
- Just, um...

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:41.037
I just got a little... job promotion.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.419

Whoo!

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.893
Well... good for you.
You stuck it out.

- About time.
- Yeah.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:12.107
- You tell Mum and Dad yet?
- No, I haven't, actually.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:13.991
- I'll give them a call later.
- Bring them around.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.323
Yeah, we'll have a dinner.

- You sure?

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.921
Yeah, yeah. I'm ready to go.
I've got my shoes on and everything.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.885
I'd better just get my coat.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:26.142
OK. Do you want me
to meet you downstairs?

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.974
Yeah, I'll meet you down there.
Give me two seconds.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:38.779
Hi.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.236
[Samantha] Your breakfast.

- How long have you been up?
- An hour and a half.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:47.572
Thank you. Even though I know
I don't get to eat the bacon.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:50.708

this was gonna happen.

Thank you for all your work.

- Are you gonna make me spin around?

Bingo! Sit down.

Oh, wow.

That's... very stylish!

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.313
Where'd you put the other one?

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.812
It's in the closet.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:47.866
- I'm glad you're happy.
- Yeah, it's lovely. Thank you.

- Thank you, guys.
[mother] It's so wonderful!

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.761
You haven't touched your wine.
Would you like some other wine?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.596
Could I get a whiskey?
Do you have any?

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.510
No, we haven't got any whiskey.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.725
[Bernard] What?!
[Anna] No. We're cutting down.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.560
We've cut down so much.
In London,

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.192
you can just be
drinking all the time.

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:23.694
- Yes.
- Bernard.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.571
[Bernard] What?
- New rules.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.403
[Bernard] New rules? Why'?
[mother] New rules'?

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:29.693
[Anna] New Simon house rules.
- Clamping down, clamping down.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.237
- He's clamping down on my drinking.
- Place is on lockdown.

01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:35.577
[Anna] It's good.
[Simon] Yeah, it's bad for your skin.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.539
[Bernard] It is?
[Anna] I am on a very tough,

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:42.296
- Simon-designed fitness regime.
[Simon] Yeah, it's called Simon Says.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:46.005
- Oh.
[Simon] Simon Says...

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.090
Yeah, we have her up at 6:30 now.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:49.799
- Every morning, running.
- No.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.430
For the last two weeks.

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.262
- Every morning?
[mother] That's what it is!

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.802
You're glowing.
I have to say, you do...

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.436
- You do look different.
- Even more than usual.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:15:59.097
[mother] You're the first person
that has ever

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:01.561
- got Anna to do any exercise.
[Simon] Really?

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.692
I thought it was the new promotion,
but all right.

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.603
[mother] I thought it was
the promotion, too.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.444
[Simon] But she has a very...
She has a very healthy breakfast.

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:10.950
A bit of oats
and some egg whites in there.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.031
- You have changed.
- A sprinkle of cinnamon, no sugar.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.492
- You have changed!
- If you want to lose weight, no sugar.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:19.158
That would be it. Everything's moving in
the right direction. I'm really happy.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.836
- This is delicious.
[Anna] It's good, isn't it?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.372
It's very, very good.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:25.710
[mother] Are we going
to play Balderdash?

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.046
- Oh, yes!
- That'll keep us going.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.837
- Actually, the night is young.
- Yeah, we can play Balderdash.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:33.677
[Bernard] Oh, lovely!
- But just before, um...

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:37.393
I just want to say
thank you for coming over.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:40.430
- It's been a really special evening.
[Anna] Thanks for coming.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.145
[mother] Thanks to you for
inviting us, my goodness!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.486
I just...
You know, I like to think of life

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:49.898
as a bit of a puzzle.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.819
- A jigsaw.
- Oh, no. He's going to make a speech.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.281
Just stick with me on this.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.788
And, um, for the longest time
there was always one piece missing.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:04.500
A big piece in the middle.
And I looked around forever.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:07.882
And I just couldn't find it.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.795
So, um, along comes Anna.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.136
And can I just
commend you two on producing

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.051
such a wonderful young woman?

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.016
She's pretty exceptional.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:23.806
I mean, we've only been
together, what, six months?

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.815
But I've known
her almost three years,

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:32.073
and she just fit this... puzzle.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.448

from my angle, complete.

You're beautiful, driven, intelligent.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.128
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:01.803
Will you marry me?

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.811
Listen, I know there's a lot of
things to be worked out here.

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:13.857
I know that there's issues
that need to be ironed out.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:18.403
But it's very important to me that you
know how much I love your daughter.

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:20.697
Darling, that's really sweet.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:28.334
I think, um...
[laughs nervously]

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:31.715
- Yeah, maybe, um...
[Bernard] I'll get my jacket.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:35.549
- Yes, and my handbag, darling?
- Absolutely. Of course.

for work anyway.
