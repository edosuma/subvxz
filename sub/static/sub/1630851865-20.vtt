-Happy Pancake Day, Ollie!

00:36.879 --> 00:38.160
Pancakes?

00:38.480 --> 00:41.480
[Ollie] Wow!
And they're in super awesome shapes, too!

00:41.680 --> 00:43.519
Yup! To celebrate the first time

00:43.680 --> 00:45.559

Let's eat!

00:51.960 --> 00:53.239
[Moon] Pancakes this special

00:53.400 --> 00:55.440

00:55.640 --> 00:56.839
Ahah, you're right.

And there's only <i>one </i>syrup special enough.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.000
Maple syrup!

01:03.760 --> 01:04.800

01:04.959 --> 01:06.679
From maple trees, of course!

[Ollie] Pancake alert!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.800
Falling flapjacks! Gotcha!

You're right. Needs maple syrup.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.479
Ollie!

01:15.640 --> 01:17.880
I'm having a sticky brainstorm!

01:18.039 --> 01:21.920
That we should go to the store
and buy a bottle of maple syrup?

01:22.039 --> 01:22.880
No!

01:23.039 --> 01:26.200
We should have a picnic
at a real-live maple tree farm

01:26.360 --> 01:30.640
in the land of all things
sweet, sticky, and mapley:

01:30.800 --> 01:32.440
Canada!

01:32.600 --> 01:34.200
That <i>does </i>sound special.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.320

a real Canadian moose!

02:16.960 --> 02:18.560
I <i>know </i>I'm forgetting something...

02:18.720 --> 02:19.959

02:34.880 --> 02:36.440
Where are the maple trees?

02:36.560 --> 02:40.200
The only maple leaf I see
is on that Canadian flag.

02:40.359 --> 02:42.040
First, we hike to the river.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.079
Then, we... [Shivers]

02:44.239 --> 02:45.320
Canoe to the syrup.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.959
But how do we get our canoe to the water?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.760
We carry it over our heads.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.480
Or, as the French Canadians say,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.120
<i>portage.</i>

02:54.280 --> 02:56.560
Well, then let's <i>portage!</i>

[Leaves rustling]

03:26.679 --> 03:30.160
Could this be the moment
I've waited for all my life?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.679
A chance to meet a real live moose?

03:33.519 --> 03:35.480
Ohh, this way?

03:36.399 --> 03:37.880
That way?

Huh...

03:49.200 --> 03:51.799
I kind of thought a moose
would be taller...

03:51.959 --> 03:53.320
No moose here!

03:53.480 --> 03:55.799
Mike's the name. I'm a beaver.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.399
Sorry for the boat bonking.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.440
I got a little lost
'cause I forgot my map, eh?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.959
Lucky you, Ollie brought a spare!

04:03.119 --> 04:04.440
What? No!

04:04.600 --> 04:08.079
I'd really like to share,
but I can't give away my spare.

04:08.239 --> 04:09.560
Why not? You have two.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.440
Sure. A map and a back-up map!

04:12.600 --> 04:14.720
In case a muskrat tramples the first one,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.760
or a caribou licks it
and smears all the ink.

04:18.159 --> 04:18.959
[Sawing]

04:19.120 --> 04:20.479
It could happen.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.800
I'll just copy a map for you
onto this piece of bark

04:23.960 --> 04:25.120
to help you find your way.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.320
OK.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.120
Just as long as it shows me
how to get to Sugarbush Bay.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.120
There you go. Just as good as a map!

-Oh!

09:09.240 --> 09:10.600
First I tap the trunk

09:10.760 --> 09:13.520
so the sap inside the tree can flow out
into the bucket.

Exactly!

09:55.959 --> 09:57.959
What are we gonna do?

09:58.520 --> 09:59.959
Hmm.

10:00.079 --> 10:03.160
What we should've done
from the very beginning!

10:03.319 --> 10:04.199
Share!

10:04.360 --> 10:06.280
[Laughter]

10:09.760 --> 10:10.880
After all,

10:11.040 --> 10:13.280
there are lots of reasons <i>not </i>to share,

10:13.439 --> 10:16.640
but one really great reason <i>to </i>share!

10:16.800 --> 10:17.880
Pancake Day!

10:18.000 --> 10:20.319
[Giggling]

10:20.439 --> 10:21.280
-Ha, ha.
-Mm.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.480
Oh, my. These are great!

10:24.760 --> 10:26.480
Here's a <i>real </i>map, Mike.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.560
So you won't get lost again.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.800
And here's the paddle you asked for, Moon.

10:31.959 --> 10:35.280
And here's a proper hat
for those chilly days.

10:35.439 --> 10:36.760
[Laughter]

10:36.920 --> 10:38.680
Perfect for passing pancakes!

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
Who wants seconds?

10:39.959 --> 10:41.319
-[Leaves rustling]
-Huh?

10:41.480 --> 10:42.720
[Grunts]

10:42.880 --> 10:44.880
[Gasps] A moose!

10:48.560 --> 10:52.000
And none of it would have happened
without the amazingness of sharing!

10:52.120 --> 10:53.400
Pancake alert!

10:53.560 --> 10:55.240
Falling flapjacks!

10:55.360 --> 10:56.120
-Gotcha!
-Gotcha!

10:56.280 --> 10:57.959
[Laughter]

10:58.160 --> 10:59.600
[Laughter]
