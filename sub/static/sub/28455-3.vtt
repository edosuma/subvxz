00:01.175 --> 00:03.420
Let's start with our new admission,
Corporal James McCain.

00:03.456 --> 00:07.321
We all have to be careful in here.
Young people are dying.

00:07.357 --> 00:10.615
The real question is why. There's
one thing that fits the data,

00:10.651 --> 00:11.759
Angel of Death.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.548
Do you have any contact
with the outside world?

00:13.584 --> 00:15.551
- Hi there, sleepyhead.
- No.

00:15.746 --> 00:18.741
Most of my patients look forward
to visits from friends and family.

00:18.797 --> 00:20.967
- Hello, son.
- We don't communicate.

00:21.004 --> 00:23.489
Isolate yourself in a place
like this and your mind can

00:23.525 --> 00:25.742
start to play tricks,
see things that aren't there.

00:26.042 --> 00:27.527
We've had a few things go walkabout

00:27.563 --> 00:29.008
and I want to get this done pronto.

00:29.066 --> 00:30.671
The wee camera's simple enough.

00:30.707 --> 00:32.992
Corporal McCain, there are discrepancies

00:33.028 --> 00:36.199
with your initial statement.
I might be easier if you talk to me.

00:36.402 --> 00:39.047
I think Charlie Elland found it
very helpful, psychologically.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.848
Dr Watson was anxious for this.

00:40.884 --> 00:41.994
Just to be clear,

00:42.030 --> 00:44.395
you're confirming exogenous
insulin as cause of death?

00:44.682 --> 00:45.753
Huge overdose.

00:45.789 --> 00:48.994
All the patient's Danny identified,
each one had low blood sugar.

00:49.228 --> 00:50.476
I think you were right.

00:50.596 --> 00:53.283
Danny was murdered, and not just Danny.

00:53.658 --> 00:54.789
All those people.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:40.560 --> 01:41.606
We're late.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.339
Breakfast?

01:43.411 --> 01:45.551
Uh-huh. Shower, five minutes.

01:50.262 --> 01:51.587
Shit.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.553
Morning.

02:41.402 --> 02:42.967
You're off for an MRI.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.567
Since when? Because I think...

02:44.603 --> 02:46.821
And seeing as I'm free,
I'm going to take you straight down.

02:51.381 --> 02:52.808
OK, so I checked.

02:52.844 --> 02:54.373
There have been other cases.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.553
Couple in America, Texas,

02:56.986 --> 02:59.635
somewhere and Manchester
a few years back.

02:59.671 --> 03:00.829
So, we go to the police?

03:01.491 --> 03:02.736
We've got evidence.

03:03.035 --> 03:05.045
Danny's data, the pathology reports.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.293
If they believe us.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.078
You told me you think this is real.

03:08.114 --> 03:11.152
It also sounds crazy.
Laila thinks you have PTSD.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.624
Why would that matter?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.118
They'll use that against you,

03:15.154 --> 03:18.138
and last year I was having
some problems of my own.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.338
I used to come down here to hide,
then I was signed off work.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.654
I'm fine now but I want
to go to Alex with this.

03:27.184 --> 03:29.125
Watson thinks the sun
shines out his arse.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.196
If he's with us, we both stand more
chance of being taken seriously.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.759
Like you said, we have evidence,
just not enough credibility.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.979
We need Alex on our side.

03:40.629 --> 03:43.005
I'm asking you to let me
deal with this my way.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.277
So what do I do?

03:45.645 --> 03:46.640
Trust me.

03:58.287 --> 04:01.478
See, grossly abnormal mortality rates.

04:01.514 --> 04:03.765
Six extra deaths in
the last eight months.

04:04.152 --> 04:06.159
And these are in comparable units?

04:07.087 --> 04:11.040
That's a 310% excess,
95% confidence of a real effect.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.045
Where did you get all this?

04:14.273 --> 04:16.373
Danny Adams gave it to Jamie McCain.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.204
Jamie McCain?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.088
Are you talking about the same guy

04:21.124 --> 04:22.700
who creeps around the ward
in the dead of night?

04:22.736 --> 04:25.123
You know Laila has
diagnosed him with PTSD.

04:25.159 --> 04:26.436
That's irrelevant.

04:26.472 --> 04:28.216
He's also under investigation
with the army.

04:28.252 --> 04:30.885
This isn't about Jamie.
I checked the data myself, OK?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.081
It doesn't make sense.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.565
This pathology stuff,
this is all confidential.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.565
Look, five different path reports,
blood sugar low each time.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.365
Suggests insulin is
the weapon of choice.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.193
This isn't real proof of anything.

04:43.681 --> 04:46.085
Fine. I'll just take
it to Archie myself.

04:46.543 --> 04:48.008
Or straight to the police.

04:48.390 --> 04:49.401
Zoe!

04:49.883 --> 04:51.554
These are accidents, Zoe.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.527
Accidents.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.085
It's a bad run.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.405
Something's wrong here.

04:56.652 --> 04:57.797
Really wrong.

04:58.437 --> 05:01.045
This time last year,
I was sitting in ITU with you.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.029
That's not what this is about. I'm fine.

05:03.065 --> 05:04.511
You're recovering.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.520
There's a difference.

05:07.160 --> 05:12.477
Look, sometimes you just,
you need to let people help you.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.005
People are dying.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.119
I'm not prepared to ignore that.

05:17.430 --> 05:18.739
All right, all right.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.565
You win.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.668
I'll talk to him,
it will be better coming from me.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.067
You know what a misogynist he is.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.961
If someone with a penis tells him
there's a problem in his department,

05:30.040 --> 05:31.306
well, he might even listen.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.885
OK?

05:34.178 --> 05:36.218
OK. Thanks.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.270
I love you.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.460
I love you, too.

05:45.501 --> 05:47.129
Yes, they said I could
head back at the weekend.

05:47.165 --> 05:48.043
That's great.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.951
Wasn't going to say anything
in case they changed their minds.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.614
It really gets lonely here,
can't wait to be back with you lot.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.372
We're looking forward to having you
back too, aren't we?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.707
OK, Lewis Hamilton.
You're driving, come on.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.200
Vroom! Vroom, vroom, vroom!

06:12.360 --> 06:15.119
Ah! There you both are.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.085
You can run, but you can't hide.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.640
Come on. Gym.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.720
Let's go, both of you.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.340
Simon's going home.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.165
He only just got here.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.740
Star pupil.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.685
Why do you think I got you two
in here at the same time? Eh?

06:36.720 --> 06:38.840
Hoping some of his shine
rubs off on you.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.000
He's got kids. Shame, really.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.051
You married?

06:47.520 --> 06:49.299
Or partner?

06:51.760 --> 06:52.901
I was.

06:54.088 --> 06:56.743
He died a long time ago.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.085
Seems like it anyway.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.293
Sorry.

07:00.329 --> 07:01.402
It's all right.

07:02.257 --> 07:05.737
OK, so are we ready
to step this up a gear?

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
OK.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.400
That's it.

07:22.217 --> 07:23.737
Wee bit more.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.400
Keep going.

07:31.553 --> 07:35.513
That's it! Better, eh?

07:36.360 --> 07:40.120
OK, so 30 seconds rest
and then we'll go again, OK?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.645
Alex, I'm glad you came to see me.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.787
I need to speak to you
as a matter of urgency.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.840
- Is something wrong?
- I need you to see this.

08:20.697 --> 08:22.405
So what are you going to do now?

08:22.440 --> 08:25.810
Get Zoe's side of the story,
but if this is what it looks like,

08:25.846 --> 08:28.933
then you and I are going to have
to nip this in the bud. Asap.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.031
She's just given me this.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.885
You should think about it seriously,

08:33.919 --> 08:35.965
now you're through
the initial recovery phase

08:36.000 --> 08:38.965
a home visit to your mum's house
is the next natural step.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.485
So send me back to base.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.605
Well, you know we can't do that.
It's impossible.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.401
The OTs have already ruled it out.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.965
But a lot of people
prefer to be with family,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.724
at least for the first few months,
a familiar environment, support.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.525
Isn't your mum local?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.645
I'm sorry, I thought
I'd been speaking English

08:56.680 --> 08:58.327
for the last five minutes
but clearly I'm wrong.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.172
I'll spell it out.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.045
I'm not going back there.

09:04.571 --> 09:07.245
Well, I don't deserve
to be spoken to like that.

09:07.821 --> 09:09.086
No-one does.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.965
You can apply for a suitable single
accommodation but it can take

09:14.000 --> 09:16.325
several months, which would
mean you have to stay here.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.799
- Fine by me.
- Look,

09:19.299 --> 09:22.326
would it really be that bad, eh?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.769
Going home.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.080
It's really hard on your own.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.609
I know that.

09:35.340 --> 09:39.700
I mean, poor wee thing,
you really have no-one?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.065
- She just sprung this on you?
- Mm.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.186
Jamie McCain is obviously
suffering from PTSD.

09:59.264 --> 10:01.805
I can live with that, even if he can't,

10:01.840 --> 10:06.192
but if his delusions are hurting Zoe...

10:06.958 --> 10:10.537
And she honestly believes
someone is harming patients?

10:11.216 --> 10:13.287
She's more vulnerable
than many people see.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.419
Something like this could,

10:16.440 --> 10:18.374
it could do a lot of damage to Zoe,

10:19.200 --> 10:20.320
to the unit.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
Yeah.

10:27.896 --> 10:30.644
You did the right thing in
bringing this to me, thank you.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.086
MDT.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.700
Let's get this done, eh?

10:43.067 --> 10:47.301
Physically, he is finally making
progress, but I broached the idea

10:47.337 --> 10:49.567
of a home visit, accompanied, of course,

10:49.603 --> 10:52.365
and well, I have to say
his reaction was quite extreme.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.048
Basically bit my head off.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.965
I could discuss it with him,
if that would help?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.885
Thanks, Zoe, but I think
if he's becoming

10:58.920 --> 11:01.725
a little institutionalised
then we'll let Laila handle it.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.725
He's a tricky customer.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.085
If that's OK with you?

11:05.120 --> 11:07.365
That's what you almost pay me for.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.805
Well, we're all Cinderellas here, Laila.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.885
If I'd lusted for money and glamour,

11:11.920 --> 11:14.125
I'd have taken up the surgeon's knife.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.645
I'm sure Mrs Watson
would have been delighted.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.067
Well, that's it.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.435
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.420
Zoe, five minutes?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.320
Take a seat, please.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.925
These reports contain
confidential patient data.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.165
As a medical professional,
you can access that information

11:45.200 --> 11:47.485
when it impacts their clinical care.

11:47.520 --> 11:52.085
Unfortunately, that definition
does not include idle curiosity.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.485
I was concerned. After Danny died...

11:54.520 --> 11:56.605
An incident I told you
I had under control.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.511
I felt I needed more evidence.

11:58.597 --> 12:00.325
If someone has been doing
this deliberately...

12:00.360 --> 12:01.925
Look, can we just keep this discussion

12:01.960 --> 12:03.445
within the bounds of credibility?

12:03.480 --> 12:06.485
All of that is nothing but wild
speculation based on very little.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.327
With respect, I disagree.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.925
If you examine the reports,
there's a clear pattern...

12:11.960 --> 12:14.250
Can we just stop this now, please?

12:14.680 --> 12:16.205
Listen to yourself for a moment.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.849
You're projecting some
kind of conspiracy

12:18.885 --> 12:22.800
onto a regrettable but frankly
unremarkable series of events.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.469
I'd rather talk about the fact
that you've been stealing medication

12:26.505 --> 12:29.895
from the ward, and it's clearly
affecting your state of mind.

12:29.931 --> 12:31.371
That's not true.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.000
In the wake of Danny's death, I
thought it wise to improve security.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.600
You don't need me to tell you
how serious this is.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.071
I had a headache.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.245
A migraine. I took some paracetamol
from the ward supply, that's all.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.010
Pharmacy carried out a stock audit,

12:53.046 --> 12:56.891
there were significant
discrepancies, sedatives mainly.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.706
Ironically we're fine
for simple analgesia.

13:04.226 --> 13:05.586
Can I be honest?

13:08.360 --> 13:11.525
I'm very concerned about you, Zoe.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.685
I'm worried that an excellent
young doctor is getting herself

13:16.720 --> 13:20.920
into a real pickle again when
she should be putting herself first.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.416
Sometimes it's all right
to look after number one.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.165
We doctors are terrible at it.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.845
I don't know, maybe it's
some kind of saviour complex,

13:28.880 --> 13:30.322
help others, hurt yourself,

13:30.358 --> 13:32.925
I don't know. Anyway,
that is why I'm going to tell

13:32.960 --> 13:34.165
you what we are going to do

13:34.200 --> 13:36.440
and you are jolly well going to do, OK?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.495
You are going to come
to work every morning

13:39.531 --> 13:43.257
and go home on time
every single night without fail.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.365
You will plan a beautiful wedding,

13:45.400 --> 13:47.938
get married and have a nice little life.

13:48.055 --> 13:51.140
That way everything is fine.
Otherwise, all of this

13:51.440 --> 13:55.259
is going to get very,
very complicated for you indeed.

13:55.840 --> 13:56.919
OK?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.343
OK.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.000
Good.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.700
Glad we understand each other.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.645
You're very tense.

14:08.953 --> 14:11.440
You should get Alex
to give you a little massage.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.245
I don't want you to have any
more contact with Jamie either.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.245
I don't think he's a happy man.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.885
And, to be honest,
it's time this unit was rid of him.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.840
In a manner of speaking.

14:26.040 --> 14:30.641
Please be kind to yourself, Zoe.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.893
In this job, it can save your life.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.205
I was trying my best to defend you

14:45.240 --> 14:46.937
but I'm not the one
stealing drugs from the ward.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.893
I told you, I had a headache.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.520
Oh, Zoe, stop lying.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.085
If you told me the whole truth,
I could have helped you see

14:57.120 --> 14:59.840
this was the old Zoe, the old problem.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.445
Someone like Jamie
is only going to make it worse.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.734
You need to take care of yourself,
or at least let me take care of you.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.363
I just...

15:13.880 --> 15:16.153
I just don't want to see you
getting sick again.

15:17.961 --> 15:19.784
This is all this has ever been about.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.685
You'll have to ask the doctor
about that, though...

15:25.013 --> 15:26.402
OK?

15:47.880 --> 15:48.971
Zoe.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.125
I can't talk to you.

15:51.290 --> 15:52.725
What? Why?

15:52.760 --> 15:54.084
What have they said to you?

15:58.342 --> 15:59.511
Zoe.

16:21.199 --> 16:24.064
Look, I think we made a mistake.

16:25.372 --> 16:29.522
Last year, I was struggling,
with the job and everything.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.364
Really struggling.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.209
I was diagnosed with hypomania,

16:34.810 --> 16:36.640
low-grade manic depression.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.925
When I was up,
I could work for days in a row,

16:40.960 --> 16:42.540
but the lows were bad.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.995
I tried to kill myself.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.046
Like, really tried.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.080
ITU for three months with renal failure.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.488
I shouldn't be here.

16:57.648 --> 16:59.240
Why are you telling me this?

17:00.800 --> 17:04.273
Because I don't know
if I can trust myself. Or you.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.484
No. This is real and we're
the only ones who believe it.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.805
We owe it to Danny, to all of them.

17:12.452 --> 17:13.724
Look, I've had an idea.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.421
Bring in the staff rotas,

17:15.617 --> 17:17.565
see who was on shift
when the death occurred.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.925
We can try and find a pattern.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.133
No.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.359
I can't do this, and neither can you.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.115
We were wrong and I shouldn't
have encouraged you.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.000
You should go, get away from here.

17:30.807 --> 17:33.102
- Zoe...
- Go home, Jamie.

17:55.045 --> 17:58.642
Of course, take a couple of days
if you need it.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
Thanks.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.180
Cheers.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.885
Make sure you've got everything.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.042
OK.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.645
- See you, pal.
- Yeah, sure.

18:20.452 --> 18:21.920
Let's go.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.518
_

19:49.918 --> 19:51.578
There's no pornography.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.296
Filtered.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.332
I just needed to check something.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.776
Sorry, these terminals
are strictly staff only.

20:02.933 --> 20:05.880
I think we should get you
back to your bed. Hmm?

20:19.569 --> 20:20.880
Allow me.

20:29.119 --> 20:31.639
This is just something
to help you stay calm.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.420
Can't have you wandering
the corridors at night, can we?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.400
I'm OK.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.920
Unfortunately, I disagree.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.978
We have a lot of
very vulnerable patients here.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.085
It's my duty to look after them.

20:48.645 --> 20:49.737
In fact,

20:51.276 --> 20:55.276
I think you're very vulnerable
yourself, Jamie.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.000
Your own worst enemy.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.440
I don't want this.

21:02.764 --> 21:03.960
Hold him down.

21:04.826 --> 21:06.306
Sit down.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.365
Sit down.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.372
That's it.

21:26.404 --> 21:27.624
That's it.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.040
Shh...

21:36.920 --> 21:38.052
Thank you.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.805
Jamie, what you need to understand

21:49.840 --> 21:53.013
is that everyone here
is just trying to help you.

21:54.057 --> 21:55.440
OK?

22:06.440 --> 22:09.240
So, I've added it to the PR inside too.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.508
20 milligrammes of Haloperidol.

22:14.514 --> 22:16.805
If he causes any trouble,
feel free to give him another whack

22:17.041 --> 22:18.849
and maybe we can all have a quiet night.

22:19.288 --> 22:20.960
So what exactly are we treating?

22:22.560 --> 22:24.553
Incipient hospital psychosis.

22:25.330 --> 22:27.296
It was all discussed in the last MDT.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.700
He's getting more delusional.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.834
Everyone's out to get him.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.205
Whenever a man dies without property,

22:49.240 --> 22:52.240
he seems to think it gives him the
right to dispose of other people...

24:50.760 --> 24:52.657
Hey, come on.

24:53.571 --> 24:54.851
Jamie.

25:02.765 --> 25:04.085
Drink this.

25:21.030 --> 25:22.502
He's been restless.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.925
Wandering the ward at night.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.365
And this is three or four times

25:26.400 --> 25:28.925
the recommended dose
of a powerful anti-psychotic.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.230
Well, sometimes that's what it takes.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.173
He was acutely disturbed.

25:34.682 --> 25:36.417
Tough guys need flattening.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.002
Or would you rather
I asked him about his mother?

25:40.320 --> 25:42.285
I know you don't
respect me or what I do,

25:42.320 --> 25:44.285
but please don't insult me to my face.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.485
I'm removing this now.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.360
I have the full support
of the clinical lead on this.

25:49.457 --> 25:52.925
And we both agree that Jamie McCain
is a risk to himself and others

25:52.960 --> 25:54.474
the longer he remains here.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.287
And I disagree.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.321
This needs to be discussed.

25:58.829 --> 26:01.589
Oh, I'm sorry, I think we just did.

26:23.721 --> 26:25.486
Well, I hope you're feeling fit?

26:31.618 --> 26:33.000
I want to go home.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.354
OK. Right, let's go.

28:07.564 --> 28:09.305
So this is where you grew up then?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.534
Moved here when I was 15.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.120
Dad's job.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.626
- Hello.
- Hiya.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.150
Come on in. I've put the kettle on.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.855
Thank you.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.885
Oh, no. No, thanks.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.120
I've got to watch my figure,
set a good example.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.869
I gave all that up a long time ago.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.805
Oh, adorable!

28:48.840 --> 28:51.067
Shame they have to grow up,
really, isn't it?

28:52.963 --> 28:53.975
Right...

28:55.332 --> 28:58.441
OK, so shall we
get down to business then?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.907
I usually start with the bedroom.

29:07.351 --> 29:08.842
They set up the bed in here.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.165
You keep a tidy house, Mrs McCain.

29:13.539 --> 29:16.180
I wish I could say the same for
some of the places I visit.

29:16.283 --> 29:17.405
I do my best.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.325
Honestly, the way people live,
sometimes it's hard to credit.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.800
Happy to exist in their own filth.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.320
Right. Well, shall we see the rest?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.765
So, we'll need to improve
the wheelchair access

30:01.800 --> 30:04.005
to the bathroom as a priority.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.005
I mean, the room's a little
bit small, but it'll serve.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.838
All in all, though, not too bad.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.485
So you're saying I pass?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.045
Oh, it's not a test.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.213
I'm just here to help you, both of you.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.872
Right, well, time for me to go.

30:19.280 --> 30:23.320
Have a lovely time and I'll be back
on Monday to pick you up.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.560
- OK.
- Thanks.

30:27.716 --> 30:31.771
Right, so this is my mobile number.

30:32.400 --> 30:36.245
Call me if you have
any problems, promise?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.045
Sure, thanks.

30:38.416 --> 30:40.205
I think he's finding it quite hard,

30:40.240 --> 30:43.400
so if he acts a bit strange
try not to worry too much.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.245
It's just the first step
on a very long road.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.122
Thank you.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.885
Well, here we are.

31:05.315 --> 31:06.699
Shall I make some more tea?

31:07.400 --> 31:09.021
Then I thought we'd try the shops.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.725
Hey.

31:30.060 --> 31:31.140
Hi.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.805
I tried to find you yesterday.

31:34.840 --> 31:37.590
Sorry, I went home. Migraine.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.681
I get them too. Stress, usually,
or too much chocolate.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.388
Actually, mainly the chocolate.

31:45.419 --> 31:46.603
Better now?

31:46.880 --> 31:48.177
Fighting fit.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.092
- Was it anything important?
- Just Jamie.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.134
I know you've been talking to him so
I thought maybe you could help me.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.805
He's my patient, that's all.

31:57.840 --> 32:01.640
Still, I value your insights
into his mental state.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.530
It takes one to know one,
is that what you mean?

32:06.040 --> 32:08.666
Empathy is an underrated
diagnostic tool.

32:09.900 --> 32:13.740
You know Alex put him
on Haloperidol, 100mg, TDS?

32:15.320 --> 32:17.965
He's a good doctor.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.312
That's what I'm worried about.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.396
Are you OK?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.480
I'm asking as a friend.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.613
Zoe...

32:30.640 --> 32:32.640
Sorry, I've got to take this.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.198
Maybe a couple of steaks tonight.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.519
See what they've got on offer.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.516
Jamie?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.019
Shit...

33:23.800 --> 33:25.760
You look amazing.

33:26.859 --> 33:28.303
So, you're released now?

33:30.466 --> 33:31.838
Weekend leave.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.685
Still doing rehab.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.177
Wow, OK.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.925
You know, I tried to come see you again.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.760
They told me you didn't want visitors.

33:42.199 --> 33:44.925
Richard, this is, er, Jamie.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.292
- He's a...
- Friend.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.240
We go back a long way.

33:51.314 --> 33:53.060
Do you want something reaching?

33:56.992 --> 33:59.240
Whisky... please.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.876
There you go.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.365
- Thanks.
- No problem.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.201
Well, we'd better be, um...

34:08.600 --> 34:10.264
I'll give you a call sometime.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.159
Cool.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.650
Here. Can I get you anything else?

34:53.920 --> 34:55.559
- Ketchup?
- It's fine.

35:11.530 --> 35:12.781
So, where's Dad?

35:18.220 --> 35:19.300
Well?

35:20.985 --> 35:22.470
One of the costas.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.245
She has a "finca" or something.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.525
She calls it a "finca",
I've seen the pictures.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.360
- It's nothing but a shitty bungalow.
- You think he beats her up?

35:32.640 --> 35:34.440
In her shitty bungalow?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.080
I hope not.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.560
Must be some mixed feelings though.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.120
A bit of pay back?

35:48.080 --> 35:50.119
I really don't think
about them any more.

35:59.030 --> 36:00.360
I stood up for you.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.018
As soon as I was old enough,
I took him on.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
Broke a knuckle but it was worth it.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.800
And you threw me out.

36:11.388 --> 36:12.823
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

36:14.349 --> 36:15.926
When you knew what he'd done,

36:16.720 --> 36:18.146
to both of us.

36:19.153 --> 36:21.205
I was never as brave as you were.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.565
So you abandon your son and
stand shoulder-to-shoulder

36:23.600 --> 36:24.686
with the bastard?

36:31.004 --> 36:32.471
And he left you anyway.

36:40.588 --> 36:43.370
So, I'll have him back
by midnight, Mrs McCain.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.944
Just a few quiet drinks,

36:45.980 --> 36:48.020
talk about the old days. Right, chief?

36:49.157 --> 36:51.092
- Sounds good.
- Right.

36:51.827 --> 36:53.671
All right, Ironside, let's roll.

37:02.047 --> 37:04.445
Welcome to the GBH Arms.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.405
Funny! I had you down
as a wine bar type.

37:08.440 --> 37:09.885
Oh, I love a wine bar, me.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.216
Andy's been here since opening.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.405
Guards, Aden, Korea.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.485
They should donate that
liver to medical science.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.245
That is one of God's finest
creations, right there!

37:25.400 --> 37:26.658
So, how are you?

37:27.920 --> 37:30.440
- Doing nothing?
- Can't stand it.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.800
Only thing worse than
the army is being idle.

37:35.242 --> 37:38.282
They got me on leave.
Non-negotiable, of course.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.245
Brother-in-law's fixed me
up with a wee job in a warehouse.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.725
They even time your piss breaks.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.165
You take three shits on company
time, you're getting fired!

37:47.240 --> 37:49.445
I mean, I could put a
good word in if you want,

37:49.480 --> 37:50.810
seeing as you've got your own wheels.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.805
Probably make you employee of the month.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.085
Thanks. I see myself
more as management material.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.848
What about you? How are you coping?

37:59.960 --> 38:02.064
I'm just glad to be
out of that hospital.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.360
The place was starting
to mess with my head.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.835
You sleeping?

38:07.131 --> 38:09.371
A Scotch or three usually does the job.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.880
That's why I need the work.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.040
You sit still for five minutes, and...

38:18.560 --> 38:20.213
Trick is not to think about it, right?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.125
The past is the past.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.774
What's done is done.

38:25.818 --> 38:28.240
We were sent in to kill
people, what do you expect?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.240
So, did you talk to them?

38:34.080 --> 38:35.236
The RNP?

38:36.360 --> 38:38.401
Did I fuck. You?

38:38.920 --> 38:41.125
She tried to tell me
you spilled your guts.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.797
That's cos they're desperate!

38:43.080 --> 38:45.765
No evidence, no crime either.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.205
Just you, me and four
other poor dead fuckers

38:49.240 --> 38:51.441
stuck in the middle
of someone else's war.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.326
The way I see it, Jamie...

38:55.400 --> 38:59.320
...is they all had it coming
or they were in the way.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.133
And, I mean, that's tough, for everyone.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.262
Simple.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.320
I'm an uncomplicated man.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.260
You know, we lost good
men in that shithole.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.521
A good woman, too.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.768
All men when you're dying
for Queen and country.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.360
You know, what happened...

39:24.780 --> 39:26.540
...and what you did out there...

39:28.240 --> 39:30.355
...look, I'll back you
every step of the way.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.640
They weren't there, I was.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.125
Right, let's step this up a gear. Shots?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.445
No, you stay seated, chief,
I'll get these in.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.208
Hey, my round.

39:48.581 --> 39:50.021
That's a direct order.

39:51.379 --> 39:53.435
Right, get us a couple of shots, then.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.543
Come on...

40:36.200 --> 40:37.505
I'm tired.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.620
You need to relax.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.845
Come on!

41:35.880 --> 41:37.085
Come on!

41:37.120 --> 41:38.925
There we go!

41:44.520 --> 41:47.657
- Hey, no man left behind.
- Charlie...

41:50.560 --> 41:52.640
Come on, let's go dancing. Let's go.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.294
I'm all right, I'm all right,
I'm all right.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.885
Sorry, lads, not tonight.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.147
Wow.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.605
This man, you know,
this man right here, he's dying.

42:03.640 --> 42:09.805
His last wish in life was to spend
a night in Distinct nightclub.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.280
If you could just...

42:12.480 --> 42:14.073
Sorry, could you just...

42:14.400 --> 42:15.725
Sorry.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.480
Need a piss.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.080
Eh?

42:58.160 --> 42:59.320
Sorry.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.680
Excuse me!

43:07.160 --> 43:08.360
Sorry.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.680
Jesus.

44:00.520 --> 44:01.720
Oh, shit!

44:05.080 --> 44:06.405
Sorry, mate.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.040
Can I buy you a drink?

44:10.680 --> 44:12.885
- Hey, apologise now.
- I just did.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.600
It was my fault. Are you OK?

44:15.920 --> 44:17.605
No, not like that, mate. To his face.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.085
- It's just one of those things.
- One of those things, eh?

44:20.120 --> 44:21.445
It's fine, Charlie!

44:21.480 --> 44:24.485
I want you to apologise for spilling
your drink on my friend!

44:24.520 --> 44:26.125
What's your problem, mate?

44:26.160 --> 44:27.885
Leave this, Charlie.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.365
That's an order!

44:29.400 --> 44:31.280
Just an accident, right?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.240
Prick.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.805
What did you just call me?

44:40.840 --> 44:42.600
Did you just call me a prick?

44:49.840 --> 44:51.200
Leave it out, mate!

44:59.320 --> 45:00.765
You OK there, son?

45:00.800 --> 45:02.765
Sorry you had to get
mixed up in all of this.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.245
Can we give you a lift somewhere?

45:04.280 --> 45:05.560
I'm with him.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.360
Don't touch my chair.

45:18.691 --> 45:19.837
Name?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.565
McCain. James.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.909
Address?

45:25.600 --> 45:28.959
North Glasgow Infirmary,
James Stuart Unit.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.965
- Shouldn't this man be in A&E?
- He refused, Sarge.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.645
Bite you in the leg, did he?

45:33.680 --> 45:35.513
Should've broken his fucking arm.

45:37.540 --> 45:38.978
Park him in a cell.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.400
There are questions about
your leadership that day.

46:18.680 --> 46:20.880
We believe you didn't follow protocol.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.440
You're lying to me.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.600
They trust you.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.765
Hey!

46:39.800 --> 46:41.200
Hey!

46:42.160 --> 46:43.920
I need to talk to someone!

46:45.120 --> 46:47.389
They're killing people! Hey!

46:48.760 --> 46:51.080
Hey! HE BANGS ON DOOR HARDER

46:52.560 --> 46:53.903
You've got evidence.

46:54.320 --> 46:58.632
Statistics, mortality data, pathology.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.080
You're not writing this down.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.043
OK, Inspector Taggart, your ride's here.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.120
Zoe usually does my blood tests.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.720
She's busy.

48:29.600 --> 48:30.950
What's this for?

48:31.400 --> 48:32.920
It's just routine.

48:51.520 --> 48:54.101
Zoe talks about you a lot.

48:58.941 --> 49:00.280
Sharp scratch.

49:03.596 --> 49:07.582
But then they all love the,
the whole super secret agent thing...

49:08.520 --> 49:10.720
...the nurses, I mean.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.358
I'm in the army.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.549
Nothing secret about that.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.406
Oops! Must've hit a nerve.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.328
Oh, there it is again.

49:26.883 --> 49:30.795
You know, I often think this place
is similar, to an army.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.485
Doctors and nurses,
brothers and sisters in arms,

49:34.520 --> 49:36.925
all fighting a common enemy.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.925
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.433
The patients, of course.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.600
I can stop if you want.

49:47.438 --> 49:49.280
It's fine. Carry on.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.240
Yes, Zoe...

49:55.280 --> 49:57.005
...she's had a tough time recently.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.800
Under a lot of pressure.

49:59.800 --> 50:01.778
That and the fact that
we're getting married.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.240
You knew that, didn't you?

50:05.400 --> 50:08.949
She really doesn't need
any... complications.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.801
If you understand what I mean.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.971
One more try?

50:18.800 --> 50:21.224
Or shall we call it a day? Hm?

50:48.080 --> 50:49.347
There we are.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.920
All done.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.250
If you ever need to speak to a doctor,

50:56.100 --> 50:57.700
just ask for me, OK?

51:08.280 --> 51:10.765
I think it's safe to say
that this little awayday

51:10.800 --> 51:12.251
was something of a failure.

51:12.680 --> 51:17.125
Obviously, the alcohol didn't help,
but I think it's now acute paranoia.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.702
- Alex?
- Oh, absolutely.

51:20.529 --> 51:22.725
I already have him held under Section 5.

51:22.760 --> 51:25.786
I think we're now looking at
detention and treatment too.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.840
In the circumstances, I don't
believe that's appropriate.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.313
Understood.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.525
But we both feel that it's crucial

51:33.560 --> 51:35.845
we take control of this situation now.

51:35.880 --> 51:38.765
You can't just imprison him, Archie.
It's outrageous.

51:38.930 --> 51:41.925
Even using a temporary
Section 5 is pushing it.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.854
I need to protect my patients.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.334
So, reluctantly, on this occasion
I'm going to have to overrule you.

51:48.760 --> 51:51.476
So let's see if we can't make
this poor man better.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.476
That's what I'm trying to do.

51:53.920 --> 51:55.760
But I won't take away his rights.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.390
Pity.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.160
Luckily, I play golf
with the team psychiatrist.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.720
I'll tee him up.

52:18.675 --> 52:21.005
If he was running a temperature
you should've called me earlier.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.205
I thought he was sleeping.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.845
- He came in still reeking of booze.
- Some hangover!

52:24.880 --> 52:27.485
Blood pressure was low. I moved
him straight away and paged you.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.680
Jesus!

52:29.760 --> 52:32.040
You're telling me you only
just noticed this?!

52:34.049 --> 52:35.285
Cellulitis.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.085
Acute confusional state.

52:37.120 --> 52:40.148
You need to treat this as sepsis,
immediately.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.040
I'll write up the antibiotics
and fluids for you now.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.280
You have no new messages.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.857
For saved messages, please press 3.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.520
Zoe.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.685
Shit!

54:42.760 --> 54:44.125
I've got nothing.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.200
Cardiac arrest.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.440
Get some help! Now!
