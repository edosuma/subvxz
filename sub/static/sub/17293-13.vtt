00:01.229 --> 00:02.765
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:02.768 --> 00:05.328
- You just killed your whole family?
- Who names a kid Malachi?

00:05.331 --> 00:06.921
Like they expected me to be evil.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.633
I linked Elena's life to
yours, and the rule is,

00:09.635 --> 00:12.670
as long as you're alive,
Elena will remain asleep.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.041
You're gonna be human.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.877
Enzo!

00:22.014 --> 00:24.469
Surely you've heard of
the legend of Arcadius.

00:24.472 --> 00:27.451
You know him by another
name... the devil.

00:27.453 --> 00:31.389
Cade. How are you here?
The bellbeang 11 times.

00:31.391 --> 00:33.461
Enough for me to pay a visit.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.580
I just came home to change
before I go to Bonnie's.

00:35.583 --> 00:36.827
Spent the last hour trying

00:36.829 --> 00:38.696
to figure out what I
was gonna say to her.

00:38.698 --> 00:40.732
If I can't figure out
a way to forgive myself,

00:40.735 --> 00:41.884
I can't expect her to.

00:41.887 --> 00:44.012
Bonnie's a much better
person than you or me.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.408
What is this?

00:50.410 --> 00:53.644
A relic of Cade's creation that
is the means to destroy him?

00:53.646 --> 00:55.485
Now that has a certain poetry to it.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.655
I say we make a plan to kill the devil.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.714
Yeah, sorry to interrupt,
but what if I told you

01:00.717 --> 01:02.082
I had a better idea?

01:10.077 --> 01:11.262
Dad, get up!

01:11.264 --> 01:14.165
Come on, Dad, do something, please.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.867
Nine. This thing's heating up.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.602
Ten.

01:18.604 --> 01:19.637
Dad, come on!

01:19.639 --> 01:20.738
11.

01:30.116 --> 01:32.516
Hey.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.052
- Where am I?
- Mystic Falls.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.121
The Grill.

01:39.459 --> 01:41.759
Oh, my God.

01:41.761 --> 01:44.228
Is it too late to order food?

01:44.230 --> 01:46.831
Beer, burger. Two burgers. No.

01:46.833 --> 01:49.305
No. Two beers, three burgers.
Are the fries here good?

01:49.308 --> 01:50.733
I remember them being a little soggy.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.136
Oh, and a hot dog! A hot dog.

01:52.138 --> 01:53.938
Is that... is that crazy?

01:53.940 --> 01:55.506
Whatever. I'll do it. Dog me.

01:55.508 --> 01:57.341
It's my special day, I am here,

01:57.343 --> 01:59.777
and here is not hell,
and that means that I

01:59.779 --> 02:02.880
am alive, so... thank you.

02:02.882 --> 02:05.382
Yeah. Good.

02:16.028 --> 02:17.528
It doesn't taste like anything.

02:25.671 --> 02:28.762
Why... can't I taste anything?

02:33.379 --> 02:36.347
Come on, come on. Come
on, come on, come on.

02:36.349 --> 02:38.415
Come on. Come on.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.284
Come on. Okay.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.526
I can't feel anything.

02:48.528 --> 02:51.362
I'm not here. I'm not alive.

02:51.364 --> 02:53.197
Okay, here's that beer.

03:01.624 --> 03:03.347
Motus.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.180
Well...

03:10.182 --> 03:12.149
at least I felt that.

03:14.053 --> 03:16.654
Is that weird or what?

03:16.656 --> 03:18.689
I mean, I can still touch stuff.

03:18.691 --> 03:20.057
I'm not a ghost.

03:20.059 --> 03:22.026
More like a psychic imprint.

03:22.028 --> 03:25.225
Stuck between dimensions
thanks to hell's bell.

03:25.228 --> 03:28.499
One foot on Earth, the other in
Cade's nightmare world of hurt.

03:28.501 --> 03:30.968
On the run, off the grid.

03:30.970 --> 03:34.538
A renegade relying only on his wits.

03:36.142 --> 03:37.641
A renegade. That's funny.

03:37.643 --> 03:39.944
I can still do magic if I siphon myself,

03:39.946 --> 03:41.779
but even then, it takes concentration.

03:41.781 --> 03:43.714
It's like having cell reception

03:43.716 --> 03:46.450
on Mars.

03:46.452 --> 03:49.119
- You murdered my wife.
- Aah. FiancÃ©e.

03:49.121 --> 03:52.022
It was mid-ceremony as I remember.

03:52.024 --> 03:55.159
But, yes, yes, yes, huge...

03:55.161 --> 03:56.560
huge mistake.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.228
I see that now.

03:58.230 --> 04:00.631
I do.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.968
Motus.

04:03.970 --> 04:07.313
Okay. Are you having a
hard time concentrating?

04:07.316 --> 04:08.305
No.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.707
Ric, hey.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.471
I have some questions.

04:15.414 --> 04:17.014
Starting with...

04:17.016 --> 04:18.548
how the hell are you here?

04:18.551 --> 04:20.184
Why don't you tell me?

04:20.185 --> 04:22.786
You guys rang some giant bell,

04:22.788 --> 04:25.456
and suddenly, I could see
Mystic Falls, so I went for it.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.791
And here I am... sort of.

04:27.793 --> 04:30.628
Please don't tell
Cade. You were in hell?

04:30.630 --> 04:33.297
Yeah, you killed me. I
think I'm on the wait list

04:33.299 --> 04:35.181
for heaven, but they're
not returning my calls.

04:35.184 --> 04:38.202
You said you had a better idea
than killing Cade with this dagger.

04:38.204 --> 04:40.804
Find a way to get me
out of hell, all the way,

04:40.806 --> 04:42.706
and then I'll help you kill Cade.

04:42.708 --> 04:44.742
I think we can manage without you.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.478
What if I brought back Elena?

04:47.480 --> 04:50.314
Let's hear him out, Ric.

04:51.408 --> 04:53.751
The kid's a sociopath.

04:53.753 --> 04:56.020
- You're gonna get us all killed.
- Not necessarily.

04:56.022 --> 04:58.955
Then have at it, Damon, and
while you're trying to outsmart

04:58.958 --> 05:00.412
the devil, I'm gonna
barricade myself in here with

05:00.414 --> 05:02.576
my two girls, who, in case
you forgot, Kai tried to murder

05:02.578 --> 05:05.496
- while they were still in utero.
- I haven't forgotten, Ric. Look,

05:05.498 --> 05:06.530
when I get out of him what I want,

05:06.532 --> 05:08.332
I will send him back to hell

05:08.334 --> 05:11.508
in pieces, I promise you.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.505
Well, whatever you're gonna do,
just do it far away from here.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.507
How about a little faith, huh?

05:18.010 --> 05:19.443
Why don't you save that question

05:19.445 --> 05:21.398
for somebody who's never killed you?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.787
Hey, it's Bonnie. Leave a message.

05:29.789 --> 05:33.524
Hey, it's me.

05:33.526 --> 05:36.460
Just calling to say...

05:36.462 --> 05:38.765
good morning.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.499
I know Stefan was gonna
pay you a visit last night,

05:42.501 --> 05:45.135
and judging by the
fact he never came home,

05:45.137 --> 05:47.705
it means it either
went really well, or...

05:47.707 --> 05:50.474
really... not.

05:50.476 --> 05:52.209
I'd love to hear your voice,

05:52.211 --> 05:55.679
but if you're not
ready to talk, I get it.

05:55.681 --> 05:57.247
Whatever you need.

05:57.249 --> 05:59.483
If you need time, space,

05:59.485 --> 06:01.819
gallons of red wine.

06:04.557 --> 06:06.323
I'm here for you.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.892
With or without Stefan.

06:22.141 --> 06:24.808
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

06:24.810 --> 06:27.377
- I need your help.
- Really?

06:27.379 --> 06:29.713
Even though I'm part of the darkness

06:29.715 --> 06:31.515
that's ruining Mystic Falls?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.584
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, okay?

06:33.586 --> 06:35.252
We have bigger problems right now.

06:35.254 --> 06:36.520
I got three calls this morning

06:36.522 --> 06:37.554
from Mystic Falls residents

06:37.556 --> 06:39.223
wanting to report old crimes...

06:39.225 --> 06:42.593
Disappearances, cold
cases... All involving Stefan.

06:42.595 --> 06:45.362
One of them even wondered
if he was a vampire.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.264
- What?
- I've been bringing them

06:46.266 --> 06:47.476
into the station and keeping them

06:47.478 --> 06:49.767
in separate rooms, trying to
keep everyone quiet for now.

06:49.769 --> 06:51.401
- How could they know those things?
- I don't know.

06:51.403 --> 06:53.990
They said these memories
came back a couple days ago.

06:53.993 --> 06:55.539
Oh, my God.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.576
When Stefan turned human,

06:59.578 --> 07:03.280
everybody he ever compelled
started to remember.

07:16.362 --> 07:18.896
Hello!

07:20.266 --> 07:22.466
Who are you?!

07:23.969 --> 07:25.469
Damn it.

07:37.483 --> 07:39.283
Dorian?

07:39.285 --> 07:40.784
Dorian Williams.

07:40.786 --> 07:43.453
You're gonna call me by my full name.

07:43.455 --> 07:46.056
Let's go.

07:46.058 --> 07:48.492
I'm not going anywhere with you.

07:51.297 --> 07:53.597
Come on.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.905
Okay, Dorian Williams.

08:01.907 --> 08:04.775
You work with Ric. I barely know you.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.476
So why you pointing a gun at me?

08:06.478 --> 08:08.545
'Cause yesterday I woke up,

08:08.547 --> 08:10.581
and started to remember.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.849
Remember what?

08:11.851 --> 08:14.351
The first time mewe me.

08:14.353 --> 08:16.587
It was at the Armory a few months ago.

08:16.589 --> 08:18.889
Like you said, we
barely know each other,

08:18.891 --> 08:21.658
so it's probably news to
you that I lost my father

08:21.660 --> 08:23.160
and my sister in a house fire

08:23.162 --> 08:24.528
seven years ago.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.031
Never came up.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.833
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

08:29.835 --> 08:31.802
Because that's not what really happened.

08:31.804 --> 08:35.172
That's the story, the lie,
that started to unravel

08:35.174 --> 08:37.941
over these last few
days when I remembered...

08:37.943 --> 08:39.610
that you were there.

08:39.611 --> 08:42.546
What are you accusing me of?

08:42.548 --> 08:44.948
My family lived in Knoxville.

08:44.950 --> 08:47.017
I was out at a high school pep rally.

08:47.019 --> 08:48.819
When I came home,

08:48.821 --> 08:51.154
the door was ripped off the hinges,

08:51.156 --> 08:53.590
and you were there.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.392
Soaked in blood.

08:55.394 --> 08:57.661
My dad.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.963
My sister.

08:59.965 --> 09:02.900
Their heads.

09:02.902 --> 09:06.503
You walked right up to me
and you looked me in the eye.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.641
I could smell their blood on your breath

09:10.643 --> 09:13.510
when you told me to
forget we'd ever met.

09:13.512 --> 09:16.713
To move on with my life.

09:16.715 --> 09:19.283
Next thing I know, I'm
in the back of a squad car

09:19.285 --> 09:21.485
doing just that,

09:21.487 --> 09:25.022
watching my home burn to the ground.

09:29.889 --> 09:32.829
I was travelling through Tennessee

09:32.831 --> 09:34.564
with someone named Klaus Mikaelson.

09:34.566 --> 09:37.668
I had to do things to
prove myself to him.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.503
Things that I tried to forget.

09:39.505 --> 09:41.326
You murdered the people I love, and...

09:41.329 --> 09:43.395
you don't even remember them?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.351
Their names were Robert
and Tina Williams.

09:55.988 --> 09:59.156
I never forget my victim's names.

09:59.158 --> 10:01.024
But you didn't bother to remember mine.

10:01.026 --> 10:03.518
So, what, if you don't murder a person,

10:03.521 --> 10:05.001
technically, they're not your victim?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.801
I'm sorry.

10:10.803 --> 10:13.236
Sorry's not gonna cut it.

10:18.770 --> 10:20.203
Start digging.

10:30.805 --> 10:32.872
Enzo.

10:34.042 --> 10:38.244
Enzo, please hear me.

10:39.859 --> 10:41.559
I don't have access to magic,

10:41.562 --> 10:44.229
so you got to meet me halfway.

10:44.231 --> 10:45.897
Please.

10:45.899 --> 10:48.300
A sign.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.003
Anything.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.648
What do you need?

11:03.650 --> 11:05.750
Just calling to make sure you're okay.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.118
I'm not.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.820
But you left me nine
messages this morning,

11:08.822 --> 11:10.589
- so you obviously want something.
- No.

11:10.591 --> 11:12.257
I don't want anything. I'm just...

11:12.259 --> 11:14.593
I'm here for you.

11:14.595 --> 11:16.328
Unrelated, um,

11:16.330 --> 11:19.164
have you made any progress getting Enzo

11:19.166 --> 11:20.599
- out of hell?
- What?

11:20.601 --> 11:22.434
I'm just saying, Cade got out.

11:22.436 --> 11:23.602
Why shouldn't Enzo?

11:23.604 --> 11:25.370
Cade used the Maxwell bell.

11:25.372 --> 11:27.005
Which is kind of a nonstarter now,

11:27.007 --> 11:29.207
unless you want to risk
nuking Mystic Falls again.

11:29.209 --> 11:31.029
I'm not a practicing witch anymore.

11:31.032 --> 11:33.190
But you're also not a quitter, Bonnie.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.700
- You know what?
- Stop it.

11:34.702 --> 11:36.527
- Why don't you call me back when
you're not... - Whoa, whoa, n-n-n-no.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.462
Wait, wait, wait. Don't
hang up. Bonnie, I'm sorry.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.364
I didn't mean to be rude. I just, um...

11:40.366 --> 11:42.933
I was just hoping you had
a solve for Enzo, because

11:42.935 --> 11:44.068
I might need a solution

11:44.070 --> 11:45.603
for someone else, too.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.805
Someone else like...

11:47.807 --> 11:49.640
Let's just say I had a...

11:49.642 --> 11:51.809
semi-ghost situation.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.512
Someone halfway in our world,

11:54.514 --> 11:57.181
who really wanted to stay here for real.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.984
- Let me say hi. Let me say hi.
- What? Shut up.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.519
This is all hypothetical, Bonnie,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.554
but what if there was a way

12:03.556 --> 12:05.556
to unlink your life from Elena's?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.626
And what if the very... small price

12:08.628 --> 12:11.695
to pay was us freeing a soul from hell?

12:11.697 --> 12:13.779
First of all, by "us,"

12:13.782 --> 12:15.548
you mean me. Second of all, it's crazy,

12:15.551 --> 12:17.793
because the only person who
could break that link is Kai,

12:17.795 --> 12:20.396
and he's been dead for years.

12:20.398 --> 12:22.464
Who's sitting next to you?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.569
- Nobody.
- Really?

12:26.571 --> 12:29.471
Because I just had the weirdest feeling.

12:29.473 --> 12:31.774
There's someone there with you.

12:31.776 --> 12:33.409
Someone you don't want me

12:33.411 --> 12:35.277
to know about.

12:35.279 --> 12:38.247
Look, let me be clear.

12:38.249 --> 12:42.017
Even if there were
someone else here with me,

12:42.019 --> 12:43.252
I wouldn't want you to know,

12:43.254 --> 12:46.088
because of a certain mind-reading devil

12:46.090 --> 12:48.357
that's on the lookout for escaped souls.

12:48.359 --> 12:50.993
And what you don't know can't hurt us.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.795
Oh, my God.

12:52.797 --> 12:55.764
Tell me you're not
talking about Kai Parker.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.743
Of course not.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.312
Why would you even say that?

13:01.314 --> 13:04.348
Because I know you.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.884
And because I have this
incredibly strong feeling

13:06.886 --> 13:08.519
that I can't explain.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.753
Everything okay, Bon?

13:09.755 --> 13:10.988
Damon, before my Grams

13:10.990 --> 13:12.489
helped me tap into my witchcraft,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.191
she told me I was psychic.

13:14.193 --> 13:17.161
Which would explain how I
know you're hiding something.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.896
And why I can still feel Enzo.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.831
Great. Fine. Can your new

13:20.833 --> 13:23.601
psychic powers help
someone get free of hell?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.569
I have no idea.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.304
But Cade would know the answer.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.539
I'm gonna ask him

13:28.541 --> 13:29.940
how to save Enzo.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.176
No. Bad idea, Bon...

13:35.181 --> 13:37.014
Mm.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.383
Did it sound like she missed me?

13:44.123 --> 13:46.056
It was about six years ago.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.825
There was this murderer,

13:47.827 --> 13:51.362
lying in a hospital
bed, with a bullet wound.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.564
I'm supposed to be guarding his room.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.966
Then the damnedest thing happened.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.936
This intense guy, weird hair,

13:58.938 --> 14:00.604
walks right up to me,

14:00.606 --> 14:02.539
looks me in the eye, and says,

14:02.541 --> 14:04.708
"Time for a little break."

14:04.710 --> 14:06.710
I'I'not supposed to leave my post.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.613
But the way he said it...

14:09.615 --> 14:11.949
Like you were being compelled to obey.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.484
Yeah.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.352
Something like that.
Anyway, I come back.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.387
And the murderer

14:16.389 --> 14:18.088
vanished.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.024
Guess who takes the fall.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.926
I lost my badge.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.428
I lost my pension.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.797
I fell off the wagon.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.100
I'm so sorry this happened

14:30.102 --> 14:31.635
to you.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.973
But you are going to forget
that night at the hospital.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.741
You're going to clean up

14:37.743 --> 14:39.510
and turn your life around.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.446
When you get a check from
Stefan Salvatore in the mail,

14:42.448 --> 14:45.115
you are not going to ask questions.

14:45.117 --> 14:48.519
You're gonna cash it and
put that money to good use.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.410
Thank you, Officer.

14:53.413 --> 14:55.659
If you feel like police
work's still in your blood,

14:55.661 --> 14:56.727
give me a call.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.470
We should reach out to his family

15:12.473 --> 15:14.587
to make sure that their stories line up.

15:14.590 --> 15:16.613
You're taking this awfully well.

15:16.615 --> 15:17.642
Are you even listening...

15:17.645 --> 15:19.816
To the horrific ripple
effect that one vampire

15:19.819 --> 15:21.085
has on Mystic Falls?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.920
Yeah, Matt, I'm listening.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.455
And I'm doing the math.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.523
And I am trying to keep
it together right now

15:26.525 --> 15:30.027
because I'm the only person
who can clean up this mess.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.472
Well, you have me
right where you want me.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.475
Whatever you want to
happen is gonna happen.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.543
But have you really
thought this through?

15:46.545 --> 15:48.779
Since my memory came back,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.181
it's all I've been able to think about.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.818
Don't do this, Dorian.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.940
Not for me, for you.

15:55.943 --> 15:58.189
What is that supposed to
be, reverse psychology?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.523
I'm not a kid anymore.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.557
And you're not a vampire,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.893
so you can't tell me what to do.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.562
Hell is real. I've seen it.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.798
And if you kill me, you're
gonna end up there with me.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.600
Screw you, okay?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.268
I'm not falling for your act.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.037
You know, all your
friends keep talking about

16:13.039 --> 16:15.339
poor, self-hating Stefan.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.875
Like getting to live is
the biggest torture of all!

16:17.877 --> 16:21.111
You know what's worse than
living with all that guilt?

16:21.113 --> 16:22.446
Surviving murder.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.214
You know what's worse than surviving?

16:24.216 --> 16:26.083
Being murdered!

16:26.085 --> 16:27.718
You're right.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.787
Don't-Don't pretend
that you're on my side.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.722
I'm not on your side. I can't be.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.064
Because you will never understand

16:33.067 --> 16:35.970
what it feels like to be
consumed with a constant hunger.

16:35.973 --> 16:37.494
Or to have a switch in your brain

16:37.496 --> 16:39.129
that can turn you into a monster.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.899
And until yesterday, I had
no idea what it felt like

16:41.901 --> 16:43.667
to be helpless in the face of that.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.935
So now that you're human,

16:44.937 --> 16:46.470
you think you're one of us.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.139
Man.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.875
In the real world, people
like you, they get the needle.

16:51.877 --> 16:54.912
Done, gone! You don't get to
walk around trying to do good!

16:54.914 --> 16:57.247
What else am I supposed to do?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.553
You're supposed to go to hell.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.655
Permanently.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.657
Believe me, I am.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.593
I'm just trying to atone
for as much as possible

17:09.595 --> 17:10.993
before that day comes.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.130
Who gives a crap about your redemption?!

17:13.132 --> 17:15.398
The damage is done, Stefan!

17:15.401 --> 17:17.367
The dead are dead.

17:17.368 --> 17:22.973
How am I supposed to move
on knowing you're alive?

17:25.207 --> 17:27.344
That you're liked?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.879
You're not supposed...

17:35.054 --> 17:37.361
How long do we have to stay here?

17:37.364 --> 17:39.523
Uh, I'm hoping just
for the night, sweetie.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.795
Maybe longer.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.590
Thought you were hunkering down.

17:46.593 --> 17:48.723
Care to explain why Twitter
just notified me that

17:48.726 --> 17:52.536
CobraKai1972 is tweeting for
the first time in four years?

17:52.539 --> 17:53.583
From a diner?

17:53.586 --> 17:56.059
Better question, why are
you still following him?

17:56.062 --> 17:58.232
- Damon...
- Don't worry. Bonnie's on it.

17:58.235 --> 17:59.849
Oh, good, you roped her in too.

17:59.852 --> 18:01.084
I was hoping you'd maximize

18:01.087 --> 18:02.612
the collateral damage...

18:02.615 --> 18:04.047
Okay.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.482
We're gonna take a small hiatus

18:05.484 --> 18:07.825
- from social media.
- Ah-ah!

18:07.828 --> 18:09.953
I figured since you're
forcing me to hang out with you

18:09.955 --> 18:11.622
while Bonnie talks to
the big guy downstairs,

18:11.624 --> 18:13.724
I may as well indulge in
the little things, you know?

18:13.726 --> 18:16.460
Oh, hey. Selfie city. Ah!

18:16.462 --> 18:17.528
Yeah, there it is.

18:18.218 --> 18:20.364
At least get a few likes while we wait.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.632
Oh, no.

18:23.249 --> 18:24.902
That's new.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.403
What's happening to you?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.505
Think I might be starting to slip back

18:28.507 --> 18:30.874
into H-E-double-hockey-sticks.

18:36.215 --> 18:38.148
Hmm.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.218
Well, I hope Bonnie comes
up with something good.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.520
'Cause my clock's ticking.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.422
And if I go,

18:45.424 --> 18:47.491
so does your shot at happiness.

18:57.346 --> 19:00.117
Thank you.

19:00.119 --> 19:02.604
You okay, sweetie?

19:02.607 --> 19:04.622
Uh, yes. Lactose intolerance.

19:04.624 --> 19:07.331
Can we just have some
napkins please? Thanks.

19:07.334 --> 19:08.959
Oh, it feels like I'm being dragged

19:08.961 --> 19:10.160
back to hell by my colon.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.562
Oh, I can't go back there.

19:11.564 --> 19:12.930
You're on fire all the time,

19:12.932 --> 19:14.632
and ghosts from your past come back

19:14.634 --> 19:15.961
to pull your skin off,

19:15.964 --> 19:17.735
and occasionally, on really bad days,

19:17.737 --> 19:19.470
you go face-to-face with
Cade, who is basically

19:19.472 --> 19:21.138
torture incarnate.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.706
This is all metaphorical.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.541
Except for the fire, which is literal.

19:24.543 --> 19:26.977
Thank you.

19:26.979 --> 19:28.412
That sounds rough.

19:28.414 --> 19:29.947
Wait, wait, didn't you go there?

19:29.949 --> 19:31.348
Didn't you work with the devil?

19:32.518 --> 19:34.919
I saw enough to convince me.

19:34.921 --> 19:36.954
But my job with the siren

19:36.956 --> 19:38.589
was my way to escape the real deal.

19:38.591 --> 19:40.257
Sirens.

19:40.259 --> 19:41.725
Man, were they hot?

19:41.727 --> 19:43.060
Sure.

19:43.062 --> 19:44.428
If you're into cannibal divas.

19:44.430 --> 19:46.163
I think I am.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.365
But the second you stop
feeding them evil people,

19:48.367 --> 19:49.800
things get ugly.

19:49.802 --> 19:51.502
Also literal.

19:51.504 --> 19:53.737
So, wait, that's what kept them going?

19:53.739 --> 19:55.272
Evil people?

19:55.274 --> 19:56.340
Mm-hmm.

19:56.342 --> 19:58.208
Oh, yes!

19:58.210 --> 20:00.144
Yes, that is it, it's so...
It makes so much sense!

20:00.146 --> 20:01.745
If hell is fueled by evil,

20:01.747 --> 20:03.180
and I'm still a little bit in hell,

20:03.182 --> 20:04.782
then maybe I can secure
my footing here on Earth

20:04.784 --> 20:06.884
by-by killing a really bad person

20:06.886 --> 20:08.719
just like those sexy sirens did.

20:08.722 --> 20:11.388
Did I mention I'm trying to
preserve my future with Elena

20:11.390 --> 20:13.357
by not killing anyone?

20:18.731 --> 20:19.930
Damon,

20:19.932 --> 20:21.865
if you think that one more murder

20:21.867 --> 20:23.133
is going to seal your fate,

20:23.135 --> 20:24.735
then I have news for you,

20:24.737 --> 20:26.904
you are super deep in the karma hole.

20:26.906 --> 20:29.573
I have an eternity to
make up for what I've done.

20:31.310 --> 20:34.345
Yes, and who knows how long I have left.

20:34.347 --> 20:35.546
Face it, buddy,

20:35.548 --> 20:37.614
you need me. And I need you

20:37.616 --> 20:41.552
right now, because I can
barely stand, let alone kill.

20:41.554 --> 20:43.287
Okay, come on, come on.

20:43.289 --> 20:44.888
Just one seriously bad person,

20:44.890 --> 20:46.256
use your best judgment.

20:46.258 --> 20:48.192
Do it for me, man.

20:48.194 --> 20:50.928
Do it, do it for your bro.

20:50.930 --> 20:52.930
- Do it for...
- Don't say "Elena."

20:52.932 --> 20:54.565
Elen...

20:59.638 --> 21:00.904
Okay.

21:00.906 --> 21:02.373
Sure.

21:04.276 --> 21:05.776
He'll do.

21:13.985 --> 21:15.418
Hey, is everything okay?

21:15.421 --> 21:16.420
Yes.

21:16.422 --> 21:19.323
Everything's okay. The girls are fine.

21:19.325 --> 21:20.824
We've just been on the road.

21:20.826 --> 21:22.526
Where are you now?

21:22.528 --> 21:24.028
Uh, at the Armory.

21:24.030 --> 21:26.363
Hey, listen, uh, I was thinking,

21:26.365 --> 21:28.626
maybe we could, I don't know,

21:28.629 --> 21:30.525
come by and meet you
at the house tonight.

21:30.528 --> 21:32.336
Oh, my God, Ric,

21:32.338 --> 21:34.805
come by and meet you that
would be just amazing.

21:34.807 --> 21:37.608
I could really uses something
good in my life right now.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.443
But are you sure you want
to bring them to town?

21:39.445 --> 21:40.511
Mystic Falls isn't

21:40.513 --> 21:42.279
100% safe yet.

21:42.281 --> 21:45.215
Well, maybe 100% isn't a realistic goal.

21:45.217 --> 21:46.750
Well, we still need to keep them safe.

21:46.752 --> 21:50.320
Oh, we will. It'll be good to come home.

21:52.324 --> 21:55.359
And I'll need some
good parenting advice.

21:55.361 --> 21:56.927
About what?

21:56.929 --> 21:59.863
Well, I'll explain when I see you.

22:09.575 --> 22:11.075
Stop looking at me.

22:11.077 --> 22:13.143
I'm guessing you never
shot anyone before?

22:13.145 --> 22:14.778
Why, because I'm staring?

22:14.780 --> 22:17.748
No, because you missed.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.451
You didn't hit anything fatal.

22:20.453 --> 22:22.052
It's gonna take me a while to bleed out.

22:22.054 --> 22:23.495
Just stop talking, all right?

22:23.498 --> 22:24.588
Don't talk anymore.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.090
Fine by me.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.293
A bullet to the head should do it.

22:29.295 --> 22:31.295
Or to the heart,

22:31.297 --> 22:33.297
if you want to avoid the mess.

22:33.299 --> 22:34.364
I said shut up!

22:34.366 --> 22:35.966
Okay?

22:35.968 --> 22:39.503
I'm trying to make it
easier for you, Dorian.

22:54.487 --> 22:56.186
All right.

22:57.289 --> 22:58.655
Squeeze that as tight as you can.

22:58.657 --> 22:59.890
- Squeeze that.
- What are you doing?

22:59.892 --> 23:01.024
What does it look like?

23:04.263 --> 23:05.996
No service. Are you kidding me?

23:05.998 --> 23:07.698
- Dorian, it's okay.
- No.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.032
No, it's not. It's not okay, man.

23:09.034 --> 23:10.467
Just squeeze that. Can you move?

23:10.469 --> 23:12.636
You got to get up. Come on, come on.

23:14.273 --> 23:16.607
Squeeze that, come on.

23:23.182 --> 23:25.382
How did I know I'd find you here?

23:25.384 --> 23:29.186
Simple. We share a kinship now.

23:29.188 --> 23:30.587
An awareness of each other.

23:30.589 --> 23:33.590
For someone new to the gift,

23:33.592 --> 23:35.359
you're quite powerful.

23:35.361 --> 23:37.561
I don't feel powerful.

23:37.563 --> 23:39.329
I don't understand any of this,

23:39.331 --> 23:40.931
but I just have to know...

23:40.933 --> 23:43.433
How do I get Enzo out of hell?

23:43.435 --> 23:45.802
Why don't you ask him yourself?

23:51.610 --> 23:54.378
I hope you're not planning
on setting me on fire.

23:54.380 --> 23:55.646
I know that's a thing with you.

23:57.483 --> 23:59.631
That would be a poor
way to start our lesson.

23:59.634 --> 24:01.495
Are you gonna teach
me how to contact Enzo?

24:01.498 --> 24:03.921
I'm going to give you an
understanding of what you've become.

24:03.923 --> 24:06.190
You've had a powerful,
traumatic awakening,

24:06.192 --> 24:08.292
just as I did.

24:08.294 --> 24:11.295
My true self sprang forth
at the moment of my death.

24:11.297 --> 24:12.930
Along with hell and eternal suffering.

24:12.932 --> 24:14.865
I'm as much a part of
my psychic dimension

24:14.867 --> 24:16.366
as it is of me.

24:16.368 --> 24:18.502
And so if you wish
to locate Enzo's soul,

24:18.504 --> 24:22.372
you must open your mind to me.

24:24.543 --> 24:26.910
Together, we may contact him.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.486
I'm ready.

24:36.488 --> 24:39.256
I want you to remember the moment

24:39.258 --> 24:40.724
of Enzo's death.

24:40.726 --> 24:43.727
Think not just of Enzo...

24:43.729 --> 24:44.962
but of how it felt.

24:44.964 --> 24:47.431
To be betrayed by your friend.

24:47.433 --> 24:51.034
To lose your love, your happiness.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.971
Think of Enzo.

24:53.973 --> 24:56.807
Think of him dying

24:56.809 --> 24:58.275
needlessly.

24:58.277 --> 25:00.911
Think of his dreams,

25:00.913 --> 25:02.913
and of his happiness.

25:07.052 --> 25:09.086
What do you feel?

25:09.088 --> 25:10.287
Rage.

25:14.260 --> 25:15.592
Anguish.

25:15.594 --> 25:17.514
Embrace it.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.129
It is the source of your power.

25:23.102 --> 25:25.435
- Bonnie.
- Enzo.

25:25.437 --> 25:26.837
Focus.

25:26.839 --> 25:29.673
Live in the trauma.

25:29.675 --> 25:30.941
Call his name.

25:32.111 --> 25:33.710
Enzo.

25:36.615 --> 25:38.849
Enzo.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.833
Bonnie.

26:00.806 --> 26:02.759
Oh, my God.

26:22.365 --> 26:25.233
Enzo, I thought I'd never see you again.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.201
You have to get away from Cade.

26:27.203 --> 26:30.037
He's trying to find me through you.

26:30.039 --> 26:31.672
He wants to claim my soul for hell.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.940
I don't understand.

26:32.942 --> 26:35.042
If you're not in hell, where are you?

26:35.044 --> 26:38.579
Do not trust him.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.552
What did you see?

26:44.554 --> 26:45.953
Was it Enzo?

26:47.757 --> 26:49.023
No.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.759
Then why are you so upset?

26:51.768 --> 26:56.170
Because I just relived
the pain of losing him.

26:57.767 --> 27:00.601
Thanks for the lesson.

27:08.778 --> 27:11.245
I'm so sorry about your niece, Mr. Fell.

27:11.247 --> 27:13.948
They say that aneurysms
are totally painless.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.076
It would have been like falling asleep.

27:16.079 --> 27:18.346
Thank you for stopping by.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.793
Poor Violet.

27:25.795 --> 27:28.429
That girl and her family
deserve so much more

27:28.431 --> 27:30.765
than just a so-called aneurysm.

27:30.767 --> 27:31.899
I don't know, that
was a pretty good lie,

27:31.901 --> 27:33.401
as far as lies are concerned.

27:33.403 --> 27:35.094
You should see the
amount of "animal attacks"

27:35.096 --> 27:36.370
your mom logged.

27:36.372 --> 27:38.172
Probably ruined camping
for an entire generation

27:38.174 --> 27:39.307
of Mystic Falls families.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.646
Hey, Dorian, what's up?

27:45.648 --> 27:47.615
I did something bad.

27:47.617 --> 27:48.916
What are you talking about?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.384
I kidnapped Stefan, I brought him out

27:50.386 --> 27:51.719
to the middle of nowhere,
and I tried to murder him.

27:51.721 --> 27:53.107
There's so much blood.

27:53.110 --> 27:54.622
- I need your help, man, come on.
- Slow down, slow down.

27:54.624 --> 27:55.656
Where are you?

27:55.658 --> 27:56.842
I'm on Pineridge Road,

27:56.845 --> 27:58.793
somewhere near the
abandoned power plant.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.565
Keep him awake. We're on our way.

28:06.202 --> 28:08.269
Feel better?

28:12.675 --> 28:14.275
Eh...

28:15.612 --> 28:17.678
- Wow.
- Listen here, you little twerp.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.246
I don't kill for kicks anymore.

28:19.248 --> 28:20.414
So if you can't tell me

28:20.416 --> 28:21.849
this guy's death meant something,

28:21.851 --> 28:24.085
I will turn this room into
your own personal hell.

28:24.087 --> 28:26.320
All right. All right.

28:26.322 --> 28:27.722
I feel a little better.

28:27.724 --> 28:29.824
Emphasis on "little."

28:29.826 --> 28:32.026
If you want to keep this
train going to Elenatown,

28:32.028 --> 28:35.329
you're gonna need to find me
some more evil people to eat.

28:35.331 --> 28:37.565
Okay? Hold that thought.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.835
Holding.

28:49.579 --> 28:52.413
Why are you following me?

28:52.415 --> 28:55.316
Because I'm not done with you.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.499
I've been wondering what
happened to Enzo's spirit

28:57.502 --> 28:59.086
since the moment of his death,

28:59.088 --> 29:02.990
and, finally, I have my answer.

29:02.992 --> 29:06.427
When Enzo died, you screamed.

29:06.429 --> 29:08.429
And something extraordinary
happened at the moment

29:08.431 --> 29:10.231
of your deepest pain.

29:10.233 --> 29:13.134
A powerful psychic blast
created an entire world.

29:13.136 --> 29:14.869
A private dimension

29:14.871 --> 29:17.405
linked only to you.

29:17.407 --> 29:20.007
Hidden, even from me.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.209
Do you realize how rare that is?

29:22.211 --> 29:23.577
In all my thousands of years,

29:23.579 --> 29:26.180
not a single person alive has ever

29:26.182 --> 29:28.182
done anything like what you did.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.218
Like... what I did.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.687
But, sadly,

29:32.689 --> 29:34.288
Enzo's soul belongs to me.

29:39.262 --> 29:41.729
Get away from me!

29:41.731 --> 29:43.864
So, not only are you
hiding Enzo from me,

29:43.866 --> 29:46.701
but you believe Kai Parker
could be out in the world.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.066
How long have you suspected this?

29:48.069 --> 29:49.769
I don't know anything for sure.

29:49.772 --> 29:52.640
If you think you can continue
to harbor secrets from me,

29:52.642 --> 29:55.109
you truly do not understand

29:55.111 --> 29:57.812
why they call me the devil.

29:57.814 --> 29:59.806
You okay?

29:59.809 --> 30:01.749
Are you seriously
asking me that right now?

30:01.751 --> 30:03.250
No, I'm not.

30:03.252 --> 30:05.319
I thought this was
what I wanted, but I...

30:05.321 --> 30:07.922
Big difference between
wanting to kill someone

30:07.924 --> 30:09.256
and actually doing it.

30:09.258 --> 30:11.058
How the hell was I
supposed to know that?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.561
But if you die, wh...
what happens to me?

30:13.563 --> 30:15.596
I don't think that's my call.

30:15.598 --> 30:17.698
Come on. No...

30:17.700 --> 30:19.166
Stefan.

30:20.136 --> 30:22.336
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.

30:24.107 --> 30:25.339
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

30:25.341 --> 30:27.608
I wish I hadn't done this to you.

30:27.610 --> 30:31.512
Yeah. I know how you feel.

30:31.514 --> 30:33.414
Stefan. Stefan, don't do this.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.249
Do you hear me? Stefan. Stefan.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.684
Stefan!

30:36.686 --> 30:39.240
Stefan! Stefan, wake up.

30:42.559 --> 30:46.686
- Wake up, Stefan. Come on. Stefan.
- Oh, my God.

30:46.689 --> 30:48.189
Help us... you can fix
him with your blood.

30:48.191 --> 30:49.624
Stefan took the cure.

30:49.626 --> 30:51.347
My blood won't heal him anymore.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.334
Won't heal him anymore...

30:58.268 --> 31:00.968
We meet again.

31:00.970 --> 31:04.138
I must admit, much
sooner than I expected.

31:04.140 --> 31:06.874
What is this? Where am I?

31:06.876 --> 31:09.243
You're dying, Stefan.

31:09.245 --> 31:11.612
We're in the space between
your final heartbeats.

31:11.614 --> 31:13.681
Between this world

31:13.683 --> 31:15.950
- and your fate.
- No.

31:15.952 --> 31:17.685
Why are you so surprised?

31:17.687 --> 31:20.721
You're mortal. Your death is inevitable.

31:20.723 --> 31:23.424
But it doesn't have to happen today.

31:23.426 --> 31:25.426
Let go.

31:26.296 --> 31:27.895
It will be so much easier.

31:27.897 --> 31:29.730
I can't.

31:29.732 --> 31:31.365
I have too much left to make up for.

31:31.367 --> 31:35.136
I meant it would be easier on Caroline.

31:36.779 --> 31:38.712
Have you even considered

31:38.715 --> 31:41.642
what your attempts at redemption
will mean for her life?

31:41.644 --> 31:44.612
50 years of following you around.

31:44.614 --> 31:47.381
Of helping you grasp for a
goal which you will never reach,

31:47.383 --> 31:49.317
as you become old.

31:49.319 --> 31:51.352
A burden.

31:51.354 --> 31:53.254
You're destined for hell, Stefan.

31:53.256 --> 31:55.189
Why should she be?

31:56.259 --> 31:58.626
If you truly love Caroline,

31:58.628 --> 32:01.796
you will release her from this
suffering and give her back

32:01.798 --> 32:04.532
the life she was meant to have.

32:04.534 --> 32:06.868
An immortal life.

32:06.870 --> 32:08.536
Without you.

32:16.711 --> 32:19.442
You would still rather cling
to that fragile existence?

32:24.154 --> 32:26.154
I guess I'm stubborn.

32:26.156 --> 32:28.823
I want to live.

32:28.825 --> 32:30.191
Well.

32:31.528 --> 32:34.128
That's only human.

32:36.565 --> 32:38.533
You're gonna be okay.

32:40.737 --> 32:42.537
I love you so much.

32:42.539 --> 32:45.006
You're gonna be okay.

32:50.813 --> 32:53.014
All right. Let's see what we got here.

32:53.016 --> 32:55.449
Oh, hey. Another fishing spot for us.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.451
A law office just a few blocks away.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.121
Talk about bang for
your buck. Am I right?

33:00.123 --> 33:01.722
I'm right.

33:01.724 --> 33:03.424
Forget all these random kills.

33:03.426 --> 33:05.226
- Wasn't done with that.
- I know how to save you.

33:05.228 --> 33:06.894
But we're under a bit of a time crunch.

33:06.896 --> 33:08.663
See, the boss found
out that you're here.

33:08.665 --> 33:10.105
Cade's coming for you.

33:10.108 --> 33:11.465
Wait, he's... he's on his way right now?

33:11.467 --> 33:12.633
I don't have an exact E.T.A.,

33:12.635 --> 33:14.068
but you know how impatient he gets.

33:14.070 --> 33:16.003
Oh... Okay. What do we do,
what do we do? What do we do?

33:16.005 --> 33:17.838
- I know what to do.
- Okay, tell me. What do we do?

33:17.840 --> 33:19.507
We find a way to redeem you.

33:19.509 --> 33:21.450
So you don't have to go to hell.

33:21.453 --> 33:22.910
What are you talking about?

33:22.912 --> 33:24.078
I'm talking about atonement.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.281
I'm talking about a giant, noble gesture

33:27.283 --> 33:28.649
of selfless generosity.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.685
- I hate this already.
- You need something

33:30.687 --> 33:33.154
that's gonna push you over
the edge in the eyes of Cade.

33:33.156 --> 33:36.591
Something to make up for all
the pain that you've caused.

33:36.593 --> 33:39.360
And what does el jefe have in mind?

33:39.362 --> 33:40.528
It's not up to him.

33:40.530 --> 33:42.263
It's up to me.

33:43.766 --> 33:45.700
People do forgive.

33:45.702 --> 33:49.604
And when they do,
redemption is possible.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.639
I know that.

33:51.641 --> 33:54.942
Which is why, if you
want my forgiveness,

33:54.944 --> 33:57.578
you're gonna bring Elena
Gilbert back to life.

33:59.115 --> 34:00.588
Right now.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.775
How's Stefan?

34:19.777 --> 34:21.177
Stable.

34:21.179 --> 34:22.478
Caroline told paramedics

34:22.480 --> 34:24.080
he was shot in a hunting accident.

34:24.081 --> 34:25.882
And they believed her?

34:26.918 --> 34:28.751
Right. Of course they did.

34:28.753 --> 34:31.219
No one knows what really happened.

34:31.222 --> 34:34.257
This will all just... go away.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.060
I shot him, Matt.

34:38.062 --> 34:41.964
I was so angry and afraid,

34:41.966 --> 34:45.668
I actually tried killing someone.

34:47.909 --> 34:50.840
Pretty sure that makes
me just as bad as him.

34:50.842 --> 34:53.242
I've hurt people for
the wrong reasons, too.

34:53.244 --> 34:55.311
But that feeling in your gut?

34:55.313 --> 34:57.780
That voice telling you to
hate yourself for what you did?

34:57.782 --> 34:59.782
That's not a bad thing.

34:59.784 --> 35:02.318
That means you're a good person.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.554
What are those?

35:05.990 --> 35:08.925
Police files on Stefan Salvatore.

35:08.927 --> 35:10.793
Going back decades.

35:10.795 --> 35:12.962
Crime reports, forensics
tying him to dozens

35:12.964 --> 35:14.964
of murders and cold cases.

35:14.966 --> 35:16.599
He wants you to have them.

35:17.502 --> 35:19.101
Why?

35:19.103 --> 35:21.771
He's putting his fate in your hands.

35:21.773 --> 35:23.673
So if locking him up

35:23.675 --> 35:25.942
is the form of justice that you need,

35:25.944 --> 35:29.054
you can go ahead and pull that trigger.

35:30.615 --> 35:34.350
Or you can set aside the past,

35:34.352 --> 35:36.719
and work on building a better future.

35:36.721 --> 35:38.688
It's your choice.

36:03.314 --> 36:05.114
The doctors stopped the hemorrhaging.

36:05.116 --> 36:06.516
They say you're lucky.

36:06.518 --> 36:09.685
You'll make a full recovery.

36:09.687 --> 36:12.255
Dorian saved your life.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.657
After almost killing you, I mean.

36:14.659 --> 36:16.659
Well, I don't blame him.

36:18.196 --> 36:21.030
He may have pulled the trigger,
but I loaded that gun years ago

36:21.032 --> 36:22.965
when I murdered his family.

36:24.569 --> 36:27.069
And he's not the only one on the list.

36:27.071 --> 36:28.838
I know.

36:28.841 --> 36:31.910
I've spent the entire day
staring your collateral damage

36:31.913 --> 36:33.676
in the face, so I know

36:33.678 --> 36:35.811
what's going through
your mind right now.

36:35.813 --> 36:37.914
You sure about that?

36:37.916 --> 36:40.816
Earlier, it would've been so
much easier for me to let go.

36:40.818 --> 36:43.419
No more guilt.

36:43.421 --> 36:45.988
No regrets.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.657
Just hell?

36:47.659 --> 36:50.092
Is that what you think you deserve?

36:51.462 --> 36:53.963
I don't know.

36:53.965 --> 36:56.432
I don't know who I am anymore.

36:56.434 --> 36:58.901
Stefan.

36:58.903 --> 37:02.605
You've only been this
person for two days.

37:02.607 --> 37:04.340
Why don't you give yourself a chance

37:04.342 --> 37:06.309
to discover who you are now?

37:06.311 --> 37:07.777
Then you'll know how to help

37:07.779 --> 37:10.479
the people that you've hurt.

37:10.481 --> 37:13.683
Because I think that
means leaving Mystic Falls.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.088
Alone.

37:19.269 --> 37:21.623
Alone.

37:24.963 --> 37:29.799
But I... I've stood by
you through everything.

37:31.803 --> 37:35.538
In what world is ending this
the answer to your problems?

37:35.540 --> 37:36.772
I'm doing it for you...

37:36.774 --> 37:38.774
Don't you dare say
that this is about me!

37:38.776 --> 37:40.443
This has nothing to do with me.

37:40.446 --> 37:43.980
Your walk al atonement and your guilt,

37:43.982 --> 37:45.514
your need to be a martyr

37:45.516 --> 37:47.383
to your past, that is all for you.

37:47.385 --> 37:48.651
Be honest.

37:48.653 --> 37:52.888
What future can we have?

37:55.793 --> 37:57.660
I don't know.

37:57.662 --> 38:00.129
I never knew.

38:00.131 --> 38:02.932
And that used to be...

38:02.934 --> 38:06.068
...exciting.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.841
But now it just feels misguided.

38:23.321 --> 38:25.454
Enzo.

38:27.525 --> 38:29.058
I'm here.

38:31.062 --> 38:35.131
I'm here. Please, I
know you're out there.

38:35.133 --> 38:38.100
If you can hear me,

38:38.102 --> 38:39.902
I need you.

38:41.706 --> 38:43.264
Hello, luv.

38:51.382 --> 38:52.748
Don't ever leave me again.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.650
Oh, believe me, I don't want to.

38:56.954 --> 38:58.454
Is it really you?

38:59.490 --> 39:00.765
Are you really here?

39:00.768 --> 39:03.325
It is really me. But
I'm not really here.

39:03.327 --> 39:05.995
Are you part of some
psychic world I created?

39:05.997 --> 39:07.663
None of that matters now.

39:07.665 --> 39:10.332
All that matters is you.

39:26.984 --> 39:28.751
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

39:28.753 --> 39:31.420
Oh, I missed you girls so much!

39:31.422 --> 39:34.557
Oh, I think you got a foot taller.

39:34.559 --> 39:36.025
Ooh...

39:36.027 --> 39:36.926
Who's hungry?

39:36.928 --> 39:38.060
- Me!
- I am!

39:41.099 --> 39:43.733
It's good to see you.

39:43.735 --> 39:46.469
It's good to see you.

39:55.279 --> 39:57.246
I want the pink cup.

39:57.248 --> 39:58.814
Honey, you always have the purple.

39:58.816 --> 40:00.182
- Pink!
- No, no...

40:01.719 --> 40:03.285
Ow!

40:03.287 --> 40:04.787
Lizzie!

40:04.789 --> 40:06.088
Lizzie.

40:06.090 --> 40:08.157
What did I say? No siphoning.

40:08.159 --> 40:09.391
I didn't mean to.

40:09.393 --> 40:11.560
Don't hurt Mommy! Incendi...

40:11.562 --> 40:12.828
No! No! No, no!

40:12.830 --> 40:15.898
Honey, don't you ever, ever say that.

40:15.900 --> 40:19.335
Okay? You could really hurt somebody.

40:19.337 --> 40:20.970
I don't know what's going on.

40:20.972 --> 40:23.172
They started acting out three days ago.

40:23.174 --> 40:25.040
I can't control it.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.710
And neither can they.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.749
How do I know you won't
kill me as soon as I do this?

40:33.751 --> 40:35.451
You don't.

40:35.453 --> 40:37.386
But if you want out of hell,

40:37.388 --> 40:40.389
it's either trust me or
run from Cade forever.

40:40.391 --> 40:44.627
Man, this thing has some miles on it.

40:44.629 --> 40:47.333
Hi, sleepyhead. Remember me?

40:47.336 --> 40:49.265
Clock's ticking, creeper.

40:49.267 --> 40:51.267
Just reverse the damn spell.

40:51.269 --> 40:53.569
Uh, it's, it's complicated magic.

40:53.571 --> 40:56.438
I need to siphon more power
first, 'cause otherwise,

40:56.440 --> 40:58.741
I might slip away in the
middle of the it, and...

40:58.743 --> 41:01.034
well, that'd be messy.

41:01.037 --> 41:02.836
What is it that you need?

41:03.447 --> 41:04.513
You.

41:05.950 --> 41:08.417
Magic takes energy.

41:08.419 --> 41:10.152
If I'm gonna do this right,

41:10.154 --> 41:13.088
I need to drain the biggest,
baddest battery of all.

41:13.090 --> 41:14.390
Kai, stop.

41:17.896 --> 41:20.296
I've been in hell long enough to know

41:20.298 --> 41:23.299
that there is no such
thing as redemption.

41:23.301 --> 41:26.068
There are only promises and bargains

41:26.070 --> 41:28.504
and tricks we play on
ourselves to make us believe

41:28.506 --> 41:30.506
that we're good people.

41:32.510 --> 41:34.543
I'm not a good person.

41:34.545 --> 41:35.911
I own that.

41:35.913 --> 41:38.013
And if I'm going down,

41:38.015 --> 41:41.531
I'm going out with a bang.

41:43.688 --> 41:46.082
- Invisique.
- No!
