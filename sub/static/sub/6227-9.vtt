WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.378
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.544 --> 00:03.921
It's not even in
the city plans.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.802
I think it was built
during prohibition.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.098
Leads down to the tunnels
beneath the city.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.642
Did you find
out where it goes?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.060
There was this big door,

00:10.135 --> 00:12.638
it looks like it hasn't
been opened for 100 years.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.881
"Dear R, maybe you
don't want to hear from me.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.480
"I'm thinking about
coming to Portland..."

00:17.559 --> 00:19.687
My God, I don't
want to deal with this!

00:19.811 --> 00:21.154
What does this
guy want from you?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.273
Just be more relaxed. How
about I take my gun off?

00:25.442 --> 00:26.614
Yeah, like that.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.740
Meisner?

00:27.778 --> 00:30.247
You know him? He was working
with the Resistance.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.369
Well, he's here now.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.952
Trubel came by, she told us about
these people that she's working for.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.118
HW.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.481
They're fighting this
underground war. Against who?

00:38.789 --> 00:39.789
Wesen.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.299
The hotspots
are Wesen uprisings.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.299
Brazil, Northern Ireland,
Pakistan, Ukraine.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.921
A world run by Wesen.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.598
Hitler tried once, now Black
Claw is trying again.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.891
Are you going
to help them?

00:49.967 --> 00:51.139
I don't know yet.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.720
I think whatever
we decide,

00:54.596 --> 00:56.564
we all decide
the same thing.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.867
It won't stay on.
Maybe it's broken.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.415
Hit it.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.253
Maybe you should
have a more dependable

01:18.328 --> 01:19.545
light source if
you're going down there.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.621
Got my phone.
Nick.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.711
What?

01:21.790 --> 01:22.837
What if the door at
the end of the tunnel

01:22.916 --> 01:23.996
isn't supposed
to be opened?

01:24.001 --> 01:25.548
What if it's
locked for a reason?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.220
Oh, it's been
locked for 100 years.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.015
Some very bad things
live a very long time.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.763
And that's why you're gonna
lock the door behind me.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.139
Nick.
I'm kidding.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.313
Look, if we ever do get
into any problems here,

01:36.388 --> 01:38.106
I wanna make sure we
have another way out.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.809
This could be it.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.606
Just be careful.
I will.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.443
What if there's a lot of water
on the other side and you drown?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.274
Not helping!

02:20.182 --> 02:22.310
- What?
- You need to see this.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.401
This unidentified man was
spotted in London on July 13th.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.235
This is 30 minutes later,
just outside the city.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.536
Fifty-seven injured,
17 killed.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.114
And one of the dead
was William Fennell,

02:35.197 --> 02:38.918
a judge who sentenced two Black
Claw soldiers to prison.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.708
Kiev, August 27th.

02:42.412 --> 02:46.292
We identified the same man at a
political rally turned violent.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.922
Seventeen injured,
three dead.

02:48.418 --> 02:53.094
Among the dead, Baris Celik, a rising
political force in women's rights.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.889
She also ran an underground
shelter for Wesen women

02:55.967 --> 02:57.935
abused by their
Wesen husbands.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.106
Her throat was ripped out.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.564
Osaka, October 17th,
an apartment building fire,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.315
injured eight, killed two.

03:06.395 --> 03:10.616
In this case, the target, Akira
Kamazari, was one of the eight.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.568
He was burned
beyond recognition.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.494
He was the key witness
in an upcoming trial

03:14.611 --> 03:16.454
of a minister
accused of corruption,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.032
with ties to Black Claw.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.617
Surveillance
found the same man

03:19.700 --> 03:20.997
two blocks
from the apartment,

03:21.076 --> 03:23.955
45 minutes
before it caught fire.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.298
Where is he now?

03:26.957 --> 03:27.958
Here.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.218
PDX surveillance found him
at 6:57 last night.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.423
Do we know
what flight he was on?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.393
Not yet. We still haven't been
able to establish an identity.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.812
I can't take him out
until I know who he is.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.933
We lost track of
him after that.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.980
So, how many will
die before we find him?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.194
No, we can't
wait any longer,

03:52.274 --> 03:55.494
we have to find out where
Burkhardt and the others stand.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.152
Nick,
can you hear me?

04:29.227 --> 04:30.524
Yeah!

04:31.396 --> 04:32.898
Did you get it open yet?

04:33.023 --> 04:34.525
No!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.490
Well, Trubel's here,
so, you may wanna

04:37.569 --> 04:39.617
forget about that
for a while.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.573
Okay, coming up.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.746
Open, you son of a bitch!

04:52.542 --> 04:53.634
Am I doing this right?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.150
Yeah, just
support his neck.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.589
Okay.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.139
Never held a baby before.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.496
Well, you must be doing all
right, 'cause he's not crying.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.722
Hi.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.894
Hey.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.227
You look like you know
what you're doing.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.809
I have no idea.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.382
I think I've had
him long enough.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.531
Yeah, come here.
Hey, bud.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.076
Hey.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
Meisner wants to meet.
Already have.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.332
No, not just you,
but with everybody.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.869
What do you
mean "everybody"?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.875
I mean, whoever's
willing to help.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.714
Nick, somebody
just came to Portland.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.713
Okay, we've connected
him to Black Claw attacks

05:33.792 --> 05:35.510
in a lot of
different countries.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.758
Look, this isn't
going away.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.466
I gotta go.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.429
We need to know
who we can count on.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.793
That's got to be
deep enough.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.924
Where's my money?
I want it now.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.922
No, no, no!

06:20.380 --> 06:23.634
No! No! No!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.342
With drought
conditions continuing over

06:57.417 --> 06:58.418
the next several days,

06:58.501 --> 07:00.299
and long-term
moisture deficits across

07:00.378 --> 07:02.130
the state remaining at
near record-levels...

07:02.213 --> 07:03.806
This
drought doesn't end soon,

07:03.882 --> 07:06.556
the only thing these farms are
gonna be raising are subdivisions.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.895
Garner's over where
that old barn is.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.809
Somewhere inside.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.433
Let's go find it.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.025
This may price some local
farmers out of the market.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.736
After this,
let's grab a coffee.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.658
I stayed up too
late last night.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.281
You make it to 9:30?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.116
What the hell?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.087
Call 911.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.634
Spice & Tea,
could I help you?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.061
- Rosalee?
- Yes.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.228
You get my letter?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.567
Yes, I did. But I
need you to stop.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.394
You should've
wrote me back.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.774
I really have
nothing to say to you,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.823
so I would appreciate it if you
didn't contact me anymore.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.616
Is that the guy who
wrote those letters?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.111
I'm going to
hang up now, Tony,

08:06.194 --> 08:08.162
please don't
contact me again!

08:08.279 --> 08:11.533
Hey, what's with the attitude?
Listen, jackass!

08:11.616 --> 08:15.587
You contact my wife again, I
swear to God you'll live to...

08:15.662 --> 08:17.585
Hello? Hey!

08:21.376 --> 08:22.798
What is that
guy's problem?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.137
Just about everything.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.556
We're not here!
Calm down.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.480
It's Nick.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.897
Hey, Nick.
Morning.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.403
Hey.
Hey.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.949
I wanted to catch you guys
before you opened up.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.197
Do you have
a minute?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.368
Yeah, sure.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.243
Look, Trubel came
over last night.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.666
She wants to know
if we are willing

08:53.742 --> 08:55.665
to work with
Hadrian's Wall.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.288
Um, aren't we kind of
doing that already?

08:58.455 --> 09:00.055
What do they want us to do?
Take an oath?

09:00.123 --> 09:02.003
I don't know. I think they
just want us to talk.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.632
Well, you know me,
not so big on groups.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.511
Yeah, look what happened
to the Wesen Council.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
I think it might be
worth talking to them,

09:08.131 --> 09:09.599
just seeing what
they have in mind.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.802
Does this include Juliette,
I mean, Eve?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.187
I think it
probably will.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.434
Is that something
you can do?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.560
Yeah, Nick,
we don't really know

09:16.639 --> 09:18.141
that much about
who she is now.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.443
Hank, I'm at the Spice Shop
with Monroe and Rosalee.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.647
Everything okay?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.778
Yeah, I'll tell you
when I see you.

09:25.857 --> 09:29.157
They got a body in a barn
off Route 30 in Skyline.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.452
Just got the address.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.662
I'll meet you there.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.366
Look, Nick, I think we really need
to find out who these people are

09:34.449 --> 09:36.793
before we sign off
on anything with them, okay?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.085
Okay.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.881
Hello, I'm Sean Renard.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.381
I've spent the last 20 years
in law enforcement.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.758
I'm not talking to you today
as a police officer,

09:47.837 --> 09:50.841
but as a neighbor who lives
and works in our community.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.805
I have never endorsed
a political candidate before.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.808
But this election,
I'm making an exception

09:55.887 --> 09:59.107
because we have an exceptional
candidate running for mayor.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.059
His name is Andrew Dixon.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.142
What time is it?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.186
I know him to be honest,
hardworking...

10:03.269 --> 10:04.349
It's time for
your close-up.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.834
...and as
concerned about this city as I am.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.531
Go to his website. Learn more
about what he stands for.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.492
I hope you vote
in this election

10:12.570 --> 10:14.698
and I urge you to
vote for Andrew Dixon.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.080
You look good
on camera.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.913
Your posture
emanates authority.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.293
This posture?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.209
No,

10:27.710 --> 10:28.927
that posture.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.681
Gets people to trust you.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.515
Well, was I convincing?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.388
Very.

10:39.973 --> 10:44.570
I think I'd rather
vote for you right now.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.746
Where's the body?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.873
Inside. On a cross.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.917
Like a crucifixion?
Looks like.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.287
Well, this is a bad
way to start the day.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.089
Somebody dragged a cross into
a barn and hung a body on it.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.426
And it seems like he's been
given a whole new outlook.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.512
Gotta mean something.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.516
Maybe.
Who found the body?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.818
Two surveyors called it in,
7:30 this morning.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.566
We got their names and
numbers if you need 'em.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.645
This guy looks
like he was stabbed

11:27.729 --> 11:29.402
with a spear or something.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
There's a circle
on the ground,

11:31.566 --> 11:33.534
probably made
with his blood.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.112
Let's get CSU out here,
get some soil samples.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.039
Yep.
You ID the body?

11:38.114 --> 11:41.243
Vic is Robert Lewis, age 33,
from Haverstraw, New York.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.078
A long history
of homelessness,

11:43.203 --> 11:44.921
arrests for vagrancy,
petty crimes.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.124
There's a symbol carved
into the wood up top.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.319
Looks like
an upside-down triangle.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.550
This goes
back to 495 B.C.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.930
So, we're talkin' old.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.226
Oh, very.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.430
It was used in Greek
philosophy and medicine.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.606
It's the symbol for water.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.481
It became widely used in Wiccan
rituals during the 18th century.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.439
An occult group known as the
Order of the Golden Dawn

12:10.521 --> 12:13.400
associated the elements
with spiritual beings.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.110
Water elementals
were referred to

12:15.193 --> 12:17.070
in the upper right
point of the pentagram.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.405
So, this was
an occult ritual?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.826
Looks like.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.084
Got a little more info
on our vic, Robert Lewis.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.127
Made it to the West Coast
about five years ago.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.922
Last known residence,
streets of Downtown Portland.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.917
Periodic appearances
in the shelter in Chinatown.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.627
So, what's with the
upside-down triangle?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.087
We think we got
an occult killing.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.922
Well, if this is
an occult killing,

12:36.005 --> 12:37.848
why choose
Lewis as the victim?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.928
And does he have any history with
ritualistic or occult crimes?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.012
Not that I've got.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.098
But maybe there's something
in New York, where he's from.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.353
Yeah, run it.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.525
Actually, wait.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.230
There's something I
have to ask both of you.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.743
Meisner wants to
know if we are willing

12:56.859 --> 12:58.987
to work with him
and Hadrian's Wall.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.617
Work with him how?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.240
My guess is to
fight Black Claw.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.584
In uniform or out of uniform?
Probably both.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.987
I wish I knew
more about 'em.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.036
Me, too.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.918
What do you know
about this Meisner?

13:08.997 --> 13:11.876
Well, just that he helped Adalind
escape the Royals in Europe.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.926
He helped Adalind
find my mom...

13:14.002 --> 13:15.800
And that Trubel
seems to trust him.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.380
Guess it can't hurt
to have a meeting.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.207
I'm not committing to anything
until I know a lot more.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.638
I'm good with that.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.136
Now, when are
we gonna meet?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.516
I have no idea.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.734
Well, until you do, I'll see if the
NYPD's got a record on our vic.

13:31.436 --> 13:35.031
You know, maybe they hung
Robert Lewis from the cross

13:35.106 --> 13:36.983
because no one
would miss him.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.202
Well, his last known
address was Chinatown.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.905
Maybe someone
missed him there?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.240
Right.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.793
Now,
watch out for spiderwebs.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.621
No one's been down here since the
last time we showed the property,

13:49.704 --> 13:51.297
and that was
about six months ago.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.381
Previous companies never did
anything with the basement.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.677
What's that smell?

13:56.753 --> 14:00.098
With this dry spell, they've
had a problem with rodents.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.595
But that's Portland.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.018
I've the number of a good
exterminator you can use.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.406
Yeah, that's Robbie.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.655
When was the last
time you saw him?

14:19.734 --> 14:21.736
Uh, yesterday,
at the shelter.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.116
He was bragging,
how some guy was

14:23.196 --> 14:25.324
gonna give him
50 bucks to do a job.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.660
And offered him another
50 when the job was done.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.211
A hundred bucks
for the day.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.503
You know
what the job was?

14:31.621 --> 14:32.873
He didn't say.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.275
Did he tell you the name of the
guy who wanted to hire him?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.469
No.
Did you see the guy?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.599
No, I can't believe
Robert's gone.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.892
If I'd known he was
going to get murdered,

14:44.967 --> 14:46.310
I would've
told him not to go.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.851
It's Wu.
Hey, what's going on?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.397
We got another guy
on a cross.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.479
Same MO, right down
to the mirrored eyes.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.563
Where?

14:57.647 --> 15:00.992
Basement of a foreclosed building
on Powell, just off 56th.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.193
We're on our way.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.325
Building is in probate. Owner
died before it could be sold.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.581
Real estate agent
called it in.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.035
Found the body
about two hours ago.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.870
Might want to use some Vapo...

15:11.953 --> 15:13.500
This one's a little ripe.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.601
How long has
this body been here?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.672
A couple weeks
at least.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.837
Definitely not
a new one.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.926
Looks like he was
gored to death, too.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.054
Got ourselves
a serial killer.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.181
Serial crucifier.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.683
Same circle of
blood around the body.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.231
Got a different carving
on the back of the cross.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.275
Wonder what
that one means.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.776
Triskele. It's Celtic.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.858
It means Water.
Or more specifically,

15:41.983 --> 15:45.032
the trinity of Earth,
Air and Water.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.020
No one knows
that much about it

15:47.071 --> 15:48.163
'cause it's just so old.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.786
Looks like it was
popular with Druids.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.743
It was carved
into the entrance

15:51.826 --> 15:53.624
to the tomb of
Newgrange in Ireland,

15:53.703 --> 15:55.626
but that dates back
3200 B.C.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.254
Damn, that's old "old."

15:59.834 --> 16:02.678
Both of the bodies
were hung on crosses.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.801
Each cross had a different
symbol carved into it,

16:04.881 --> 16:07.054
but they each signified
the same thing, Water.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.389
Let's hit the books.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.756
Were you able to
take anyone alive?

16:21.939 --> 16:26.115
I tried, but they just
kept on coming. They wouldn't stop.

16:26.861 --> 16:27.862
I got one.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.076
Where?

16:36.454 --> 16:37.580
Will he be
able to talk?

16:38.831 --> 16:39.923
Eventually.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.259
We'll
take him with us.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.888
Wait a minute,
these symbols.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.640
That cross
almost looks like a...

16:51.719 --> 16:53.687
Couldn't be. That stuff's
ancient history.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.855
What is?

16:54.931 --> 16:58.606
Fuilcré rain rituals. They involved
runes and crosses and blood.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.187
You know, the usual
cult ritual hoopla.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.567
Okay, what is a Fuilcré?

17:02.897 --> 17:05.992
Kind of a bovine-ish,
ox-like fellow.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.660
Actually, one of the first
to self-domesticate

17:07.734 --> 17:09.203
and cultivate
the land for food

17:09.278 --> 17:11.497
instead of, you know,
hunting Kehrseites.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.115
Progressive.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.200
Yeah, sure.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.536
Till you consider
the human sacrifice factor.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.219
Whenever the crops
weren't doing so well,

17:18.287 --> 17:20.210
they'd perform this
ceremony to bring rain.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.215
So, it was a rain maker?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.089
Supposedly
works for droughts,

17:24.167 --> 17:25.385
like the one we're in now.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.553
Yeah, but guys, really.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.506
This stuff is seriously
ancient history,

17:28.631 --> 17:30.383
I mean, the last
Fuilcré ritual was, like,

17:30.508 --> 17:32.306
500 years ago,
give or take a century.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.585
All right,
so, Why'd they stop?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.059
Grimms.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.981
According to legend,

17:38.099 --> 17:40.443
any family that continued
the practice was wiped out.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.112
I mean, like down-to-the-
last-child wiped out.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.241
Little severe, but it got the
job done, that's for sure.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
Take a look.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.911
These two runes
were at our last crime scenes.

17:53.990 --> 17:58.461
This says the last recorded
Fuilcré ritual was in 1596.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.796
Let's see...

18:05.293 --> 18:07.842
Who am I kidding, I can't read this.
It's like Middle Irish.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.847
Let me see.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.474
Well...

18:16.846 --> 18:21.522
Translates to "And the blood will
spill on the earth as water."

18:26.689 --> 18:31.786
"And the seven sacrifices
will form the Plow," I think?

18:31.861 --> 18:34.580
I don't know,
the next pages are burned.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.330
My mother's family
is Irish.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.753
I spent a lot of
summers there as a kid.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.879
There was no TV.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.040
Wow.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.877
Just when you think
you know somebody.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.711
Oh, you said
seven sacrifices?

18:49.754 --> 18:50.755
Yes.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.966
Well, if we’ve found two,
then there are five more.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.014
I think you need seven to form
"the Plow." Whatever that means.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.393
So that means there's going to be five
more murders, if they haven't happened.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.692
Both crime scenes used
the exact same type of wood.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.442
Six-by-six by 12 beams, so if
we're talking seven crosses,

19:06.520 --> 19:08.773
that means someone out there is
buying a lot of that kind of wood.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.233
I'll have Wu check
the lumberyards.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.244
Our second victim,
Demitri Bolger.

19:13.319 --> 19:17.620
Born in Bulgaria, emigrated
to the United States in 1992.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.202
First arrest in Portland,
vagrancy, six years ago.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.834
Rap sheet's very similar
to our first victim.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.039
Last known address?

19:25.247 --> 19:27.170
Streets of Portland,
Southeast.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.877
Tracked down a lumber order
you might be interested in.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.345
How interested
would we be?

19:31.420 --> 19:33.013
Those wood beams
you asked about,

19:33.089 --> 19:35.512
bulk purchase of
six-by-six by 12s?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.514
Where?
Columbia Lumber.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.593
You get a customer name?

19:38.636 --> 19:40.104
That they wouldn't
give me over the phone.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.299
Gonna have to put a little
shoe leather into this one.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.980
Ask for Mr. Fargo.
Duncan Fargo.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.982
Are you Duncan Fargo?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.285
I figured you guys
might be coming by.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.491
I got the paperwork
in my office.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.532
Look, it's not like I
don't wanna cooperate,

19:59.615 --> 20:01.868
it's just I can't go giving
customer information

20:01.951 --> 20:04.045
out over the phone
to whoever calls.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.464
I don't trust anybody
nowadays, over the phone.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.042
But now that I
know you guys are

20:09.125 --> 20:11.799
actually cops, I'll
cooperate however I can.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.552
I can't get in trouble
for this, I mean, legally?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.720
You'll be fine.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.303
This is the only
bulk purchase made

20:20.386 --> 20:23.105
of six-by-six by 12s
in the last two months.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.500
But the guy got lots of other
lumber in that same purchase.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.069
Charged to
a Mark Holloway.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.068
The address where we delivered
it to is right there on top,

20:31.147 --> 20:34.492
only, I'd appreciate it if you
guys didn't mention my name.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.569
I don't want my customers
thinking I ratted on 'em.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.199
Well, even if they
broke the law?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.122
That's your territory,
guys.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.129
Can I help you?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.055
We're looking
for Mark Holloway.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.598
Well, who are you?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.674
I'm Detective Griffin,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.136
Who are you?

21:02.219 --> 21:05.098
I'm Jonathan.
Mark's my dad.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.433
What's this all about?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.555
We just have to ask him a few questions.
Is he here?

21:09.310 --> 21:11.108
Yeah, he's working
on the tractor.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.360
Back, behind the barn.
Thank you.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.487
I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.664
Just wanna ask you
about a lumber purchase.

21:22.907 --> 21:23.954
Why?

21:24.033 --> 21:27.003
Sir, were six-by-six by 12
beams in your last order?

21:27.203 --> 21:32.209
Yeah, I buy a lot of lumber. Somethin'
illegal about six-by-six by 12?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.880
Depends on
how you used them.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.555
Mind if we take
a look at them?

21:37.630 --> 21:38.722
I don't have 'em.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.056
Where are they?

21:42.051 --> 21:43.268
They were stolen.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.146
What's this
all about, anyway?

21:46.222 --> 21:49.442
Two homicide cases involved beams
with the same measurements.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.064
We're checking
out lumber purchases

21:51.143 --> 21:53.316
in the area, crossing
off names, and yours?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.981
Is on the list.

21:59.777 --> 22:00.994
Oh, my God.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.199
We're taking
you in for questioning.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.336
You're a Grimm!

22:14.083 --> 22:15.335
Get back on
the ground!

22:19.630 --> 22:20.847
Get down!

22:21.757 --> 22:23.930
Stay on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.903
Kill me. Just don't
hurt my family.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.498
Assaulting an officer, you should
start thinking about yourself.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.779
I'm not here
to kill anyone.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.786
Dad?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.080
Dad, what are they
doing to you?

22:45.155 --> 22:46.452
Stay out of it, son.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.954
No, where are they
taking you?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.501
The precinct.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.622
Why? What'd he do?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.133
I had nothing
to do with this.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.055
You've never seen
these two symbols?

23:02.464 --> 23:05.593
Two bodies were crucified,
matching the Fuilcré ritual.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.566
How do you know about this?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.565
How I know is
not why we're here.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.646
The lumber used in
the crucifixion matches

23:17.730 --> 23:19.949
an order you placed
at Columbia Lumber.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.118
And all you're telling us
is that the lumber was stolen.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.194
Now, doesn't that
seem convenient?

23:24.278 --> 23:25.621
I didn't do anything.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.369
You attacked
a police officer.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.332
He's a Grimm! I thought
he was gonna kill me.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.502
Did you report the lumber
stolen to the police?

23:31.577 --> 23:32.703
- No.
- Why not?

23:32.786 --> 23:34.163
It was only
$300 worth of wood.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.606
You think the police are gonna
drop everything to find that?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.757
When was it stolen?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.881
I don't know, it was delivered
when I wasn't there.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.008
They put it in the barn, it
could have happened anytime.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.134
I don't lock up
the barn.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.432
You understand
the problem here.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.009
You're a Fuilcré.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.890
You know about these
ancient sacrifices,

23:49.011 --> 23:51.935
your farm's having trouble
because of the drought.

23:52.014 --> 23:55.018
You even ordered the same type
of lumber used in the crimes.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.480
So, how do you
explain that?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.867
Uh, there is something.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.207
A couple of weeks ago,
a man came by our house.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.250
Said he represented
a group dedicated

24:12.326 --> 24:13.953
to bringing
back Wesen culture,

24:14.036 --> 24:16.289
traditions and rituals.

24:16.372 --> 24:20.002
You know, everything that had been
given up thousands of years ago.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.420
I don't know,

24:22.503 --> 24:25.973
it didn't make sense to me
and I wasn't interested.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.182
What was his name?

24:28.092 --> 24:31.096
Uh, Donald,
I don't know, something...

24:31.220 --> 24:33.222
Smith, Jones,
something common.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.515
Can you describe him?

24:36.225 --> 24:39.695
About my height.
Less than 200 pounds.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.064
Short hair.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.320
He looked normal,
for a fanatic.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.407
Did he leave you his card?
Any contact information?

24:48.445 --> 24:49.913
There was a flyer,
talking about some

24:50.072 --> 24:51.494
meeting the group
was gonna have.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.866
Do you still have it?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.084
No, I threw it away.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.254
Do you recognize this?

25:01.542 --> 25:04.546
Yeah. It was on the flyer,
never saw it before that.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.925
What does it mean?

25:06.088 --> 25:07.260
You buy his story?

25:07.339 --> 25:11.936
He has motive, if you consider an
ancient rain crucifixion ritual motive.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.305
Well, DA would have
a lot of fun with that.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.106
You're gonna have to connect
Holloway to these victims

25:16.181 --> 25:17.433
with some kind of
physical evidence.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.686
Right, we can charge him
with assaulting an officer.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.896
I don't wanna charge him
with that if I can avoid it.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.105
I know why he did it.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.445
It's supposed to be seven
sacrifices for this ritual,

25:25.524 --> 25:28.243
and we have two bodies, one of
which is at least a week old.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.820
Both victims are homeless.

25:29.903 --> 25:30.870
Problem is,
we don't know if this is

25:30.946 --> 25:32.619
the second victim
or the seventh.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.957
There's a possibility
of five more.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.513
We've checked every missing persons
report from the past month.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.414
But homeless people aren't
usually reported missing.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.089
What do you want us
to do with Holloway?

25:41.165 --> 25:44.294
Hold him for 72 hours, see
what you can come up with.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.384
You know, my great-great-grandfather
on my mother's side

25:47.463 --> 25:50.307
was a big believer in
rituals and sacrifices.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.473
I think that's what got him
burned at the stake.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.858
Both victims
were gored to death.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.311
Like, with a horn?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.942
Yeah, then hung up
on crosses.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.695
This wasn't a Fuilcré,
was it?

26:50.359 --> 26:51.656
You know about that?

26:51.860 --> 26:55.865
When I was a Hexenbiest. Freaky
rituals are kind of our thing.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.954
Yeah, I was looking at the
books with Monroe and Rosalee,

26:58.033 --> 26:59.501
but some of
the pages were burned.

26:59.993 --> 27:04.214
And we know that there are seven
sacrifices that form the image of a plow.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.588
But we don't know
what the plow is.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.552
Well, Fuilcré religion
revolved around the stars.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.802
"The Plow" is what they called
Ursa Major in England and Ireland.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.554
Ursa Major,
like, the Big Dipper?

27:14.675 --> 27:16.302
Seven stars.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.137
So, the killings
are gonna form

27:18.220 --> 27:20.268
a big dipper to
match the constellation?

27:21.056 --> 27:22.854
Yeah, maybe.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.603
The Aztecs had this
ceremony built around

27:25.727 --> 27:27.821
Orion's Belt, it was
called "the Fire Drill."

27:27.896 --> 27:29.489
Why they called it that,
I don't know.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.659
But every time Orion's Belt
rose above the horizon,

27:31.733 --> 27:34.156
they would sacrifice a man
on top of a pyramid.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.666
What?

27:39.741 --> 27:41.414
How do you know
these things?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.787
Home schooling.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.844
I'm going to ask
you a few questions.

27:58.927 --> 28:02.807
If you don't cooperate, someone
else will ask you questions.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.392
Will you cooperate?

28:09.188 --> 28:11.691
I don't think
he's gonna cooperate.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.819
He's all yours.
I'm getting coffee.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.794
So, you don't
wanna talk?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.296
Well, if you
don't wanna talk,

28:30.375 --> 28:31.922
then you won't be
needing your mouth.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.816
If you can't
talk to me,

28:48.143 --> 28:50.817
then you probably
don't wanna see me, either.

28:59.821 --> 29:03.496
Speak no evil,
see no evil...

29:04.451 --> 29:06.829
We're missing one,
aren't we?

29:06.912 --> 29:08.334
Oh, that's right.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.001
Hear no evil.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.179
How long is
he going to take?

29:19.258 --> 29:22.228
Depends on how much
information you want.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.683
I want all of it.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.862
Then we'll give him some time
alone with his thoughts.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.710
Hey.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.584
Freight train engineer called
it in, 5:45 this morning.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.586
Wasn't exactly
sure what he saw,

29:51.665 --> 29:53.087
but thought we
should take a look.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.716
So, this
happened last night.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.813
Train came through here at 11:30
last night, didn't report it.

30:00.882 --> 30:04.227
I'm thinking it had to have
happened sometime after that.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.850
Blood's still tacky.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.473
Same MO.

30:08.724 --> 30:12.695
And another one of these damn runes.
Probably means Water.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.739
There's no way Mark Holloway
could have done this.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.987
Have Holloway released.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.192
Yeah.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.036
All right, can we figure
out this sacrificial

30:21.069 --> 30:22.696
Big Dipper now that
we have three bodies?

30:22.863 --> 30:24.160
Yeah, we should try.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.333
Well, might be able to figure
out where he'll kill next.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.251
If he hasn't already.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.462
The guy we arrested said
someone came to his house,

30:30.537 --> 30:33.837
gave him a flyer with the
Black Claw mark on it.

30:33.915 --> 30:34.962
It was about a meeting.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.464
Have you ever
heard of any

30:36.543 --> 30:38.011
Black Claw meetings,
or anything like that?

30:38.086 --> 30:39.429
No.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.677
I can ask around,
if you want,

30:41.757 --> 30:43.851
but what do you want me
to do if I find out?

30:44.301 --> 30:45.427
Go.

30:45.761 --> 30:46.853
Try to see
who's running it,

30:46.928 --> 30:48.225
maybe get some
photos if you can,

30:48.305 --> 30:49.602
but don't risk
getting caught.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.358
No, don't worry,

30:51.433 --> 30:54.437
I can be as good a brainwashed
zombie-headed zealot as anybody.

30:54.603 --> 30:58.233
Okay, guys, our first
victim was found here.

30:59.441 --> 31:03.491
Our second victim was found
in a basement off Powell.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.913
Here.

31:05.530 --> 31:10.081
And the third victim was found
on the railroad tracks, there.

31:10.744 --> 31:14.794
We don't know what stars these
are, so we can't anchor the map.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.544
Well, I mean, it looks kind
of like the ladle, right?

31:20.670 --> 31:23.298
I mean, we just... We need a
reference point, that's all.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.300
Wait.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.391
That's Huntington Graveyard,
right?

31:28.804 --> 31:29.896
Yeah.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.191
Well, the last star in
the handle of the Plow

31:33.266 --> 31:37.942
is the star Alkaid, which in
Arabic means "Chief of Mourners."

31:38.188 --> 31:42.989
Well, then, if that's
referring to Huntington Graveyard,

31:43.068 --> 31:45.912
then that could be
our reference point.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.412
Which would mean
that these four points

31:50.659 --> 31:52.536
are the next
sacrificial sites, right?

31:52.619 --> 31:54.041
All right, well,
I'll have officers

31:54.121 --> 31:55.839
check those
locations now.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.505
Has it been long enough?

31:59.584 --> 32:02.007
If you don't want
him to lose his mind.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.358
Can you hear me?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.521
Would you like
to see me?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.919
Would you like
to talk to us now?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.214
What's his name?

32:49.676 --> 32:51.519
I don't know his name.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.222
I swear, I swear.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.646
I do know that
he's a courier.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.478
I just... I don't know his name.
He delivers messages,

32:59.561 --> 33:00.858
that's it.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.154
What kind of messages?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.698
Anything they want done.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.241
What's he doing
in Portland?

33:05.358 --> 33:06.735
He's here?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.536
I didn't know that.

33:09.863 --> 33:13.834
If he came here to deliver a
message, who's he giving it to?

33:17.621 --> 33:19.965
Lucien!

33:20.916 --> 33:22.293
Lucien Petrovitch!

33:23.376 --> 33:24.673
Petrovitch is here?

33:24.753 --> 33:25.845
Yeah.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.765
He's the only one who can
talk to the other cells.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.012
Where is he?

33:30.467 --> 33:31.764
Nobody knows.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.431
He never stays in one place
longer than one night.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.974
Make sure he tells us
everything he knows.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.562
I am, lam.
I swear to you, lam!

33:51.571 --> 33:52.993
Jonathan?

33:55.158 --> 33:56.626
Jonathan?

33:59.287 --> 34:00.789
Jonathan!

34:06.419 --> 34:08.638
Oh, my God.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.902
I know how dangerous
it is for you all to be here,

34:25.981 --> 34:28.279
and I commend you
on your courage.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.487
Some of you will think
the risk is too great,

34:32.571 --> 34:35.165
but we are
witness to an Awakening.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.208
Welcome to the new era.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.377
An era of change.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.170
An era where
people like us,

34:43.206 --> 34:46.255
that's right, we all know
what we're talking about.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.178
Wesen!

34:51.547 --> 34:55.098
An era where people like us no
longer have to live in the shadows.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.100
Too long have we been
marginalized by normal society,

34:58.179 --> 35:00.728
and by "normal," I mean...

35:02.684 --> 35:04.436
Kehrseite!

35:05.353 --> 35:07.447
No! No!

35:08.356 --> 35:10.825
Hate them!

35:12.193 --> 35:13.319
But no more.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.161
We must take back our heritage!

35:16.656 --> 35:18.499
Take back our traditions!

35:20.035 --> 35:23.209
The days of our oppression
are coming to an end.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.092
The days of our persecution
are coming to an end.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.383
When we stand united,

35:30.629 --> 35:33.508
no one, no one can stop us!

35:33.590 --> 35:34.887
What are you doing here?

35:35.008 --> 35:36.260
Dad, this is our heritage!

35:36.343 --> 35:38.220
How could you get mixed up
with these fanatics?

35:38.303 --> 35:39.976
Dad.
Leave the kid alone.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.149
This is my son.
Stay out of this.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.993
We have three bodies
and four possible locations

35:54.069 --> 35:55.537
for other
sacrificial sites.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.156
Three of those four are
out of our jurisdiction.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.706
We've contacted
the county sheriffs,

35:58.782 --> 36:00.079
they've sent
out patrols.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.622
How did you
explain this to them?

36:01.701 --> 36:03.328
Ritualistic
serial killer.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.663
They asked
if it was satanic,

36:04.746 --> 36:06.794
we didn't say no.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.385
Just heard from
one of the sheriffs,

36:10.460 --> 36:11.928
they just got to
one of the sites.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.255
Here.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.683
They found another body, it's been
there for at least two weeks.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.305
They just sent this.

36:18.385 --> 36:19.762
That makes four dead.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.272
Monroe, you're on speaker.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.191
Hey, Nick, this is
definitely Black Claw.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.439
But it's more like a...

36:27.519 --> 36:29.692
I don't know, it's like a
recruiting center, or something,

36:29.771 --> 36:32.274
I mean, this guy is really
firing these people up.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.734
Well, who's the guy?

36:33.817 --> 36:35.034
All I could get
was "Donald Jones,"

36:35.110 --> 36:36.987
I don't know if that's
his real name, or what.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.619
But, dude.
This guy is good.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.416
I mean, he is whipping
them into a frenzy,

36:41.491 --> 36:44.290
I mean, like, that they are suckin'
the Kool-Aid fountain dry.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.624
Did you get
a picture of him?

36:45.912 --> 36:47.380
They said
no cameras. I'm...

36:47.455 --> 36:48.547
I wanna stay.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.508
I'm workin' on it.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.460
We're going home!

36:52.544 --> 36:55.138
That's your culture
they're talking about, too!

36:56.423 --> 36:58.300
These people
are insane!

36:58.508 --> 37:01.011
They think just because
something's old, it's true.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.345
They're superstitious.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.646
Let me go!

37:11.771 --> 37:13.318
I'm not going!

37:18.862 --> 37:19.863
Jonathan!

37:19.946 --> 37:21.746
Your kid's old enough
to make up his own mind.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.159
I told you to stay out of this.
Hey.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.965
You're
not going anywhere.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.678
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

37:30.832 --> 37:32.505
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

37:32.584 --> 37:35.007
Guy... Hey!
What is going on here?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.178
He a friend of yours?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.301
No I don't know him,

37:37.380 --> 37:39.257
but we're all Wesen, right?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.263
I mean, didn't
you hear Donald?

37:41.384 --> 37:43.307
We're all brothers
and sisters, you know?

37:43.386 --> 37:44.512
Not him.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.352
Get him
out of here.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.482
Yeah, right on,
Occultatum libera, man.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.938
Totally.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.323
You Okay?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.790
No.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.222
Fourth victim has been
identified as Tom Harmon.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.599
Last known residence,
streets of Portland.

38:25.678 --> 38:26.725
Griffin.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.023
Yeah.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.351
Where's the body?

38:33.812 --> 38:35.109
Approximate time
of death?

38:36.231 --> 38:40.031
At least three weeks? Are you sure?
Okay, thanks.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.829
Were you able to
identify the fourth victim?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.738
Because we're gonna have to do
a press conference on this.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.039
We just got a fifth.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.331
What?

38:46.407 --> 38:47.659
Burkhardt.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.582
Yeah. Uh-huh. They
just found number six.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.959
Where?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.337
Now there's only one left.
At the end of the handle.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.714
I can't remember what she called it.
Alkaid.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.140
"Chief of Mourners."

39:03.716 --> 39:05.639
It's Arabic.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.118
Got a call from
Huntington Cemetery.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.146
Please tell me you
didn't find another body.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.359
None that weren't supposed to be there.
No wooden crosses, either.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.310
Well, maybe he hasn't
made the final sacrifice.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.561
Let's get out there.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.347
What the hell?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.401
What am I
doing up here? Hey.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.275
Hey. What?
Hey! Hey!

39:58.521 --> 40:00.694
Oh, my God!
Stay away from me!

40:04.485 --> 40:05.702
Step away!

40:05.820 --> 40:07.868
Get
down on the ground!

40:07.947 --> 40:09.324
Do it, now!

40:11.034 --> 40:12.752
Stop!

40:18.583 --> 40:20.381
on, God!

40:23.838 --> 40:27.217
"And the blood shall be spilt
upon the earth as water."

40:33.056 --> 40:34.353
Who the hell is that?

40:34.515 --> 40:37.689
It's the guy from the
lumberyard, Duncan Fargo.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.612
The guy I talked
to on the phone?

40:39.687 --> 40:41.405
He's the one who
put us onto Holloway.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.779
He probably stole Holloway's
lumber when he delivered it.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.735
Which is why Holloway
didn't know it was gone.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.576
Get me down, get me down,
please get me down!

40:49.155 --> 40:51.453
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.042
Just relax.

40:53.409 --> 40:54.456
What is it?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.709
It changed into
some kind of demon!

40:57.914 --> 40:59.632
Tried to crucify me!

40:59.707 --> 41:02.460
Help's on its way.
Just try to calm down.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.137
Adrenaline can do crazy
things to perception.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.101
Yeah, this is
Detective Griffin.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.311
We're gonna
need a coroner.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.034
Six dead for some
ancient superstition.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.078
That we can't
explain to anybody.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.035
Except Wesen.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.920
Let's just write down
what we can, and go home.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.438
Don't go there.
