00:17.200 --> 00:18.680
[Sophie] Parker.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.880
Parker, I am so sorry.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.600
You gave me your word.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.800
You looked me in my eye
and you said you wouldn't show that video.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.520
Okay, but I had no other choice.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.560
Michelle said that the piece
wouldn't work without that final part.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.960
Michelle?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.400
So, what, you two are best friends now?

00:37.480 --> 00:38.600
Parker.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.440
I just wanted you to know,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.480
I've always wanted us to be together!

00:43.560 --> 00:45.080
I love you!

00:45.160 --> 00:46.440
[laughing]

00:46.520 --> 00:49.520
Don't take it too hard, man.
You're viral now!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.640
Please, just please hear me out.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.760
-Just hear what I have to say, Parker.
-No.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.520
[theme music playing]

01:23.080 --> 01:24.960
[distorted voice on phone]
I enjoyed that little display

01:25.040 --> 01:27.280
-you arranged for me today.
-I'm glad to hear that.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.800
[distorted voice] We should talk
about your next assignment.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.840
Okay.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.000
I've just sent you the new coordinates
on our encrypted site.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.840
That is where your next earthquake
should hit.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.680
It's 90 miles north of here.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.280
Redron? The pharmaceutical factory?

01:43.360 --> 01:46.360
I want the entire plant destroyed.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.160
I took a huge bet
on Redron stock to plummet,

01:49.240 --> 01:51.160
so you should make this one
bigger than the last.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.280
Bigger than 5.2?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.520
These pharma plants are open at all hours.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.240
There could be casualties.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.280
I think the $50 million each of you
will earn will ease your conscience.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.600
Are we on the same page, Judy?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.080
-We are.
-Good.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.160
One more thing.
I saw the Greenhouse in the news earlier.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.760
The last thing you need
is having the media swarming the campus.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.440
-I advise you shut the story down.
-[phone beeps]

02:28.560 --> 02:30.240
Don't forget the blueberries!

02:30.320 --> 02:31.760
Of course.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.280
Your mom would never forgive me
if I left 'em out.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.240
[sighs]

02:38.000 --> 02:39.440
Were you able to get some sleep?

02:39.520 --> 02:41.760
You sounded really stressed
on the phone last night.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.200
Uh, yeah, you know,
it's not that easy to sleep

02:45.280 --> 02:47.040
after a 5.2 earthquake.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
Yeah.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.760
I still can't believe you were caught
in the middle of that earthquake.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.320
How's Alex?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.840
He's fine. Moody, but fine.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.000
What's wrong with him?

03:00.080 --> 03:03.120
Hmm... girl trouble.
He got his heart broken.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.000
Aw, poor little puppy. How's he coping?

03:07.080 --> 03:10.480
You know how he is.
He just shoots hoops all day.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.000
Yeah. [chuckles]

03:21.920 --> 03:25.200
What about you? How's Leo?
I like that kid.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.360
Well, then you'll love his girlfriend.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.920
She just came back from London
and joined the Ravens.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.560
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.760
He didn't mention he has a girlfriend?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.720
He knows your dad works
for the FBI, right?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.160
[both chuckle]

03:46.880 --> 03:48.480
I love you, Dad.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.080
I love you.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.120
You'll always be my girl.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.960
So, 5.2 earthquake,

03:59.040 --> 04:01.440
Leo's ex-girlfriend...
That's some week you've had.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.720
Yeah.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.720
And I was swimming when the earthquake hit

04:05.800 --> 04:07.720
and I almost drowned

04:07.800 --> 04:09.520
and I saw Mom.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.680
What?

04:21.600 --> 04:22.440
What is it, Soph?

04:23.160 --> 04:24.720
[stutters] It's Michelle.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.240
She wants me to send her
more videos from my blog.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.000
Michelle Wallace reads your blog?
Sophie, that's huge!

04:32.680 --> 04:37.320
[stammers] Yeah. She wants to do
a bigger feature on the Greenhouse

04:37.400 --> 04:38.800
using my blog videos.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.680
This story will air nationally
on all their affiliate news stations.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.560
Here, listen to what she wrote.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.320
"Sophie Cardona, you are the new face
of Gen V, Generation Viral."

04:49.400 --> 04:51.360
Sophie, you're gonna be famous!

04:52.680 --> 04:55.720
What's wrong?
Don't tell me you're getting cold feet.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.920
It's just that I still feel bad
about what happened with Parker.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.680
Please. Look, you were reporting the news.
Parker needs to grow up.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.560
Everyone, can I have your attention?

05:07.240 --> 05:10.040
I am proud to announce
that our captain, Sophie Cardona,

05:10.120 --> 05:13.160
is gonna be featured
on KYOO-TV's national broadcast

05:13.240 --> 05:15.680
with a profile story on the Greenhouse!

05:17.600 --> 05:20.120
Guys? What's wrong with you?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.520
Sophie sold us out.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.840
Excuse me?

05:23.640 --> 05:26.560
I deserve that. I wasn't honest.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.000
But, guys, I promise,
I will never do that again.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.840
You should've thought about that
before you threw me under the bus.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.920
When we talked on the phone,
you didn't mention you were in the water.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.040
I was.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.640
But that's not the point, Dad.
I saw Mom.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.080
Where?

05:50.160 --> 05:51.360
In the water.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.160
And it was the strangest feeling.
I mean, I really felt her presence.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.320
And I know I used to get upset
when you would say the same thing,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.160
but now, I kind of get it.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.280
It makes sense for you
to have these kinds of visions

06:06.360 --> 06:08.240
when you're in a life-or-death situation.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.160
It was more than just a vision.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.880
I mean...

06:14.400 --> 06:16.440
what if Mom is really alive?

06:17.760 --> 06:19.120
[sighs]

06:19.880 --> 06:21.920
A smart girl once told me

06:22.000 --> 06:24.200
that I wouldn't be able
to get on with my life

06:24.280 --> 06:27.040
until I came to terms
with my wife's death.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.760
I'm not going to let you fall
into the same trap I fell in.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.400
-Brooke?
-[Brooke]  Hi, Judy.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.760
-How are you?
-Listen, honey.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.280
-About your friend, Sophie...
-Yes?

06:46.360 --> 06:48.960
I think it would be best for your father
and the Greenhouse

06:49.040 --> 06:52.240
if she stopped making those
news videos about the school.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.600
But it's going on national news!

06:53.680 --> 06:57.360
-This is her big break!
-It's bad for the Greenhouse.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.040
Do you understand?

07:01.680 --> 07:02.800
I do.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.880
Sophie's only looking out for herself,
not her friends.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.680
-That's no way to be a leader, right?
-Right.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.760
Good.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.200
So you'll talk to her
and make sure she quits?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.800
-Yes.
-Good.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.960
[Jackie] Are you the Bizarro Max?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.600
The one who can handle sunshine?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.800
What's with the face, Max?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.360
It's Emma, right?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.440
I called her three times
but she never picked up.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.240
I know that she's screening my calls.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.720
Did I ever tell you how I learned to surf?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.960
I was dating this guy.

08:08.040 --> 08:13.720
And at first he was kind of nice,
and then he turned out to be not so nice.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.720
Anyway, he broke up with me.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.360
Clearly he was not
a very intelligent person.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.840
True.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.920
And that was a nice thing of you to say.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.960
Anyway, this guy used to surf, like,
extremely well,

08:33.679 --> 08:37.880
so I used to follow him
without him knowing, just to watch him.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.679
Technically, that's called stalking.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.840
Technically,
I'm the one telling the story.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.760
And I just couldn't get over him,
you know?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.440
I used to cry, like, all the time.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.880
[stutters] You? Cry?

08:52.960 --> 08:56.440
Yeah, I used to cry when I'd hear
the surf reports on the radio.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.800
I even cried when I smelled fish,
because it reminded me of the ocean.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.360
You cried because you smelled fish?
[chuckles]

09:04.440 --> 09:08.920
Anyway, one day I saw this baby
in a garage sale.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.680
And it was going for, like, nothing.
So I bought it,

09:12.760 --> 09:17.080
and I took it the beach, and I found
some nice surfers who taught me basics.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.640
And I fell down a lot at first,
but then I got better.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.080
By the time I learned to surf,
I didn't even think of this guy anymore.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.680
So you see what I'm trying to say to you?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.680
That I should start surfing?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.080
[both chuckle]

09:45.280 --> 09:46.600
Thank you for doing this, Sophie.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.880
You know, it's been a while
since we've got

09:48.960 --> 09:51.960
such strong reactions
on a story we've aired.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.120
Really?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.800
[chuckles] That's amazing, Michelle.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.120
[imitating Sophie] Really? [scoffs]
Wow, Michelle, that's amazing.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.160
[all laughing]

10:00.240 --> 10:02.040
[Michelle]  What was that?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.040
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

10:06.120 --> 10:10.480
Get used to people being jealous.
It goes with the territory.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.000
-I'll talk to you soon, okay?
-Thanks.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
[exhaling]

10:27.120 --> 10:29.840
[chuckles] I get it.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.480
I hurt your feelings.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.520
But I'm not gonna apologize for trying
to make my dreams come true.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.120
[scoffs] Women leaders are always
unfairly criticized for their ambition,

10:39.200 --> 10:42.480
but if I were a guy, you'd probably
high-five me for promoting the Greenhouse.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.440
So because you're a woman,
it makes you immune to criticism, huh?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.320
I don't think so.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.000
Besides, there's a big difference

10:49.080 --> 10:51.720
between promoting the Greenhouse
and exploiting it.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.760
-I'm not exploiting anyone!
-That's exactly what you're doing, Sophie.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.080
[scoffs] No.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.200
I... I have a rare opportunity
to do something for my future.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.600
You talk a great game about ambition
and leadership, but really...

11:04.680 --> 11:06.080
this is all about your ego.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.000
Who knew the only thing
you cared about is yourself?

11:16.440 --> 11:17.640
Did you hear that, Brooke?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.480
-I did. Parker's right.
-[Sophie scoffs]

11:20.560 --> 11:22.160
What?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.640
Sorry, Soph. I'm with Parker on this one.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.680
[stutters] You're joking, right?

11:28.840 --> 11:31.480
You're supposed to be on my side.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.440
I'm on the side of the Greenhouse.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.120
And what you're doing,
it's bad for the Greenhouse.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.640
Where is everything?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.320
What do you mean?

11:44.400 --> 11:47.280
Everything!
The articles, the documents about Mom?

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
I threw it all out.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.440
Why?

11:50.520 --> 11:51.760
Are you serious?

11:51.840 --> 11:53.800
I can't believe you threw everything away.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.000
You're the one who told me to do it.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.760
Yeah, well, I... I wish
you hadn't listened to me!

12:01.000 --> 12:02.800
I'm glad I listened to you!

12:05.360 --> 12:06.600
What's wrong with you?

12:07.680 --> 12:08.680
What do you mean?

12:08.760 --> 12:10.240
How could you do that to Sophie?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.920
What, I can't change my mind?

12:12.520 --> 12:14.080
You can do whatever you want.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.680
But Sophie's your best friend, and you
humiliated her in front of everyone.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.800
What made you do a 180 on her?
Did someone pressure you?

12:20.880 --> 12:25.040
Don't be silly.
Besides, your mom agrees with me.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.960
My mom?

12:27.040 --> 12:30.000
Yeah. She totally supports me,
just like you should.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.320
[Parker] Guys,
let's get one thing straight.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.160
We all know those videos were supposed
to be for internal viewing only.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.320
So if Sophie emails any of her videos
to that Michelle reporter,

12:51.400 --> 12:53.920
-none of us will ever talk to her again.
-[door slams]

12:54.000 --> 12:55.280
[scoffs] I can hear you, you know.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.840
We're not gonna let her sell us out
to the tabloids. Right?

12:57.920 --> 13:01.000
-[boy] Right.
-You're not going to threaten me, Parker.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.560
Sophie, don't send out that email.
It's not worth it.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.040
-Email sent.
-[Parker] Then it's official.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.000
So long, Sophie.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.560
What, are you all ignoring me now?
What is this, the third grade? Stop it.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
Try to see their side.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.560
They feel like
you're only thinking of yourself

13:33.640 --> 13:35.480
and not your friends.
