00:27.903 --> 00:32.329
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen
let nothing you dismay</i>

00:32.533 --> 00:36.788
<i>Remember Christ our saviour
was born on Christmas Day</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.423
Shh. You're too loud.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.924
<i>When we were gone astray</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:45.429
<i>O tidings of comfort and
joy Comfort and joy</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:49.808
<i>O tidings of comfort and joy</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:54.605
<i>"Fear not then," said the angel
"Let nothing you affright</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:58.768
<i>"This day is born a saviour
of a pure virgin bright</i>

00:58.934 --> 01:01.374
<i>"To free all those who trust in
him from Satan's power and..."</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:06.571
Male, 9 years old.
Possible ruptured eardrum.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.615
His name's Paul.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.446
- You're his parents?
- Yes.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.786
- I need to get some basic information.
- He'll be all right.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.872
So, this is Paul.
Last name, please.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.457
- Potts. P-O-double T-S.
- Paul Pott.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.875
- What, like the Cambodian dictator?
- Not at all like the Cambodian dictator.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.562
How long since it occurred?

01:25.627 --> 01:28.221
About an hour.
He collapsed during choir practice.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.930
It's a miracle he hasn't ruptured
our eardrums with all his hooting.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.595
He's passionate.
Will he be able to sing again?

01:34.761 --> 01:37.184
Oh, yes,
I don't see an issue there.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.611
Fluid buildup in the ear, but we'll
have him right as rain in no time.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.988
So, he'll be fine?
It's not dangerous?

01:45.188 --> 01:49.238
Well, could be. But we can't tell
until we fish around inside his noggin.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.153
Café's just down the corridor.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.619
He'll be right as rain, love.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.622
Come on.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.807
<i>As long as I can remember,
I've wanted to sing.</i>

02:16.678 --> 02:18.897
<i>I mean, really sing.</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:25.863
<i>I was born with what our
choir master called "a big voice</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:30.109
<i>A voice that was "born to
sing opera," said my mum.</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:31.948
<i>And so I did.</i>

02:32.778 --> 02:36.533
<i>At home, in school,
in church, on the bus.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:38.788
There he is! Get him!

02:39.534 --> 02:41.332
Get back here, Pottsy!

02:41.495 --> 02:43.964
<i>It turned out not
everybody loved opera,</i>

02:44.122 --> 02:47.467
<i>and not everybody loved the sound
of my voice as much as my mum.</i>

02:47.626 --> 02:49.879
Get him!
We're gonna get you, Pottsy!

02:50.045 --> 02:52.673
Get back here, you big fat blob!

02:52.839 --> 02:55.513
<i>And I got teased and bullied,</i>

02:55.676 --> 02:58.850
<i>mostly by my classmate
Matthew Spade and his gang,</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:02.562
<i>if you can call a bunch
of 9-year-olds a gang.</i>

03:05.769 --> 03:08.568
<i>The more they bullied me,
the more I sang.</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:13.114
<i>The more I sang,
the more they bullied me.</i>

03:13.276 --> 03:15.574
- Come on, Pottsy!
<i>- Singing. Bullying.</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:18.331
<i>- Bullying and singing.</i>
- Oy! Fatty!

03:18.490 --> 03:20.959
<i>It was a seemingly
endless drama full of music</i>

03:21.118 --> 03:23.917
<i>and violence and
romance and comedy.</i>

03:24.830 --> 03:26.548
<i>Kind of like an opera.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:30.218
<i>The opera of my life.</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:07.005
<i>Tidings of comfort and joy</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:11.673
<i>Now to the Lord sing praises
all you within this place</i>

04:11.835 --> 04:16.055
<i>And with true love and brotherhood
each other now embrace</i>

04:16.214 --> 04:20.219
<i>This holy tide of Christmas
all others doth deface</i>

04:20.385 --> 04:24.640
<i>O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy</i>

04:24.806 --> 04:31.906
<i>O tidings of comfort and joy</i>

04:34.316 --> 04:35.659
That's very nice indeed.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.969
"Be gentle with me," said she.
“Unicorns are not meant for human love."

06:25.135 --> 06:30.437
"But, lady," said I, "I am only half
human." And I laid her down, and took her

06:30.599 --> 06:33.352
there amidst the moss
and leaves of the forest floor.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.067
- That was your weekend?
- In a nutshell. Yours?

06:36.229 --> 06:39.073
- Did you just say you shagged a horse?
- It's a game.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.951
Role playing. Like Dungeons
& Dragons, but for real.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.158
She was a girl,
but dressed as a horse?

06:44.321 --> 06:46.699
- A unicorn.
- Right. And you were...?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.452
A half-elf wizard from the Black
Mages Guild of Quilanthium.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.130
- OK.
- And how's your girlfriend?

06:53.288 --> 06:57.134
Oh. She's brilliant. She really is.
She's absolutely fantastic.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.047
And are you actually planning
on meeting her at any point?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.348
- She keeps asking me, but...
- But what?

07:03.506 --> 07:06.555
You've been texting over a year.
What are you waiting for?

07:06.718 --> 07:09.562
- Nothing, it's just...
- You're not 100 per cent sure

07:09.721 --> 07:11.064
she's actually a woman.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.224
Of course I am.
I'm sure she is.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.441
I'm absolutely sure that she definitely
must be. Let me show you this text.

07:17.604 --> 07:21.484
She sent me this the other night.
This is like, 11.00. She says...

07:21.691 --> 07:23.159
Oh, God.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.820
What's crawled up his arse?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.287
The signal on this
phone is total crap.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.869
Right.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.834
The thing is,
for the service to actually work,

07:34.996 --> 07:39.126
the phone itself should really be
in no more than three or four pieces.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.135
- It's under warranty.
- Of course.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.047
I'll tell you what.
How's about this, Gandalf?

07:44.214 --> 07:48.014
You give me a phone that works, and
I won't lodge this one up your arse.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.020
I doubt you'd get
much of a signal up there.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.279
- Oh. Nearly forgot. Here.
- Cheers.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.941
I took the liberty while you were
bravely cowering in the back...

08:03.108 --> 08:04.701
Took the liberty to do what?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.157
Sunday morning,
Port Talbot railway station.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.943
Your boyfriend's on
the 9.15 from Cardiff.

08:09.969 --> 08:11.066
You did what?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.669
It's not easy losing your virginity
to someone 50 miles away.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.378
- So, you invited her here?
- You did, as far as she knows.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.794
- Jesus. She looks like Cameron Diaz!
- Oh, how terrible.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.054
- Yeah, it is.
- In what univ...?

08:24.462 --> 08:27.887
Hold on. You told her you looked
like someone famous as well.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.720
- A bit. Yeah.
- Who?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.943
Brad?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.902
Cameron?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.119
You're a woman.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.621
What?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.374
That is fantastic.

09:34.699 --> 09:39.250
Thank you. Well, you've obviously got
a very low bar. That's a good thing.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.544
Welcome to Port Talbot.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.759
Thank you.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.840
Sorry I'm late. I...

09:47.003 --> 09:49.677
- I thought you stood me up.
- No, I wouldn't dare.

09:49.839 --> 09:54.891
No, I was... I wanted to get you
something, but the florist was shut,

09:55.053 --> 09:58.353
- so I got you this. It's a good one.
- Aw.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.940
You don't need batteries.
You wind it up.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.104
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- It's orange.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.613
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.615
It's a torch.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.617
It's ace.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.156
You hungry?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.493
- Always.
- Great.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.542
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.548
Right. So, there's bad pub food
or really bad pub food.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.053
- Oh.
- Which do you prefer?

10:29.212 --> 10:30.805
So many options, so little time.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.058
Oh.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.969
It's just my mum making sure
that I'm still alive

10:36.136 --> 10:38.309
and you haven't murdered me.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.224
As if I'd murder you in broad daylight.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.691
I'd wait till it was dark.
I wouldn't do it on the high street.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.528
I'm not actually gonna murder you.
I'm babbling. I'm nervous.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.491
Don't be.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.908
- Really nice gloves.
- Paul?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.994
- Thank you.
- Is that you, love?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.659
Oh, God.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.338
- Well, bless my soul!
- Hi.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.214
Well, hello.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.341
- I'm Paul's mum.
- It's my mum.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.346
- Lovely to meet you.
- This is Julz. It's...

11:11.504 --> 11:12.847
Why didn't you tell...?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.474
You must come to lunch.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.476
- My husband would love to meet you.
- Absolutely not.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.262
You need to be getting back.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.973
I'd love to come.
Let me help you with this.

11:22.140 --> 11:27.488
Thank you, love. Aren't you lovely?
Now you must tell me all about yourself.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.694
- That's a lovely torch.
- Oh, thank you very much.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.658
Then I thought to myself,
"I haven't got the slightest interest

11:35.820 --> 11:39.825
"in die-cast aluminium figurines."
So, I got a job at the pharmacy in Boots.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.084
Honest job, Boots.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.711
As is Carphone Warehouse.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.131
Have some more potatoes, love.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.794
Oh. Thank you.
Gosh, that's loads. Thank you.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.337
And your parents,
what do they do?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.846
Dad.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.508
- It's all right. My mother works...
- Her mum's a seamstress.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.268
Her dad's on disability
from the plant in Bristol.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.146
Oh. Did Paul tell you,
I met his mother in Bristol?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.648
No.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.811
I spent ten years in the metalworks
over there in Redfield, near that pub.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.821
Yeah, the Black Horse.
That's where Paul was conceived.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.450
- Back seat of Roland's car.
- That's what we're gonna talk about?

12:14.609 --> 12:17.408
Why not? It was wonderful.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.289
Paul tells me you were quite
the rugby player in your time.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.791
Mm.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.044
I did once fracture

12:24.202 --> 12:26.546
- Gareth Edwards' clavicle.
- Here we go.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.708
Yeah, he was running down
the wing, about to cut inside...

12:31.834 --> 12:34.883
I made the front page of the
<i>South Wales Argus</i>, I did.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.764
That was a proud day.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.802
You're not the only celebrity
in the family, then.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.562
Paul could get a
job at the steelworks.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.063
Get a flat of his own.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.901
Hard to come by,
union benefits these days.

12:48.059 --> 12:51.154
- I'd sooner sleep under a bridge.
- That can be arranged.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.990
No, Paul's gonna be
a wonderful singer.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.741
Oh, God.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.284
I thought you two
only met this morning?

13:00.446 --> 13:04.496
Nonsense. How could I be his
girlfriend if we've only just met?

13:04.993 --> 13:09.248
It turns out that all the time we thought
he was on his computer looking at porn,

13:09.414 --> 13:11.963
he was actually
e-mailing this lovely thing.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.378
Look at him blushing now.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.138
Couldn't you just eat him up?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.095
You'd need a couple of sittings.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.697
Wow.

13:39.110 --> 13:43.035
I knew you were mad for opera, but I didn't
know you were completely psycho for it.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.618
What's this?

13:46.784 --> 13:49.958
This is "Che Gelida Manina"
from La Bohéme by Puccini.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.873
Pavarotti sung this aria in 1961

13:52.040 --> 13:54.543
in a singing competition
that changed his life.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.635
What, like made him a superstar?

14:00.131 --> 14:04.011
Leave them be, Roland!
Do you wanna scare her off?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.977
On the contrary. I'm trying to
rescue her from the bloody violins.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.520
Do you wanna go for a walk?

14:11.517 --> 14:13.519
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.776
- And opera, just...?
- I always loved it, since I was a kid.

14:18.941 --> 14:23.742
From the first time I heard Pavarotti
sing "Nessun Dorma," that was...

14:23.905 --> 14:28.877
- You must have been a very strange boy.
- I was. I still am.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.754
No, I always loved it.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.506
It's like a dream world to me,

14:33.664 --> 14:37.043
where people speak their feelings
and say exactly what they mean.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.553
In French or Italian.

14:38.711 --> 14:43.308
That's the beauty of it. Like, if you
just shut your eyes and listen to it,

14:43.466 --> 14:49.599
suddenly you're somewhere else.
Like, somewhere beautiful,

14:49.764 --> 14:52.358
or exciting and dramatic and real.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.897
Like more real than real life
could ever be.

14:58.314 --> 15:02.865
I think I am only truly happy
when I am listening to or singing opera.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.660
- Will you sing for me?
- Oh...

15:06.823 --> 15:09.918
- Go on, just a little bit. Go on. Why not?
- It's not...

15:10.076 --> 15:11.919
I get nervous.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.296
OK.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.716
Someday, then?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.045
Someday.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.559
- One foot and then the other.
- Yeah.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.725
Have you ever
seen him live, Pavarotti?

15:29.887 --> 15:32.153
No, but he's on the
board of the opera

15:32.179 --> 15:34.793
school I'm saving up for
to go to in Venice.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.607
So, it's all about meeting him?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.694
There's no chance he'll be there.
But the school's got a great track record

15:40.857 --> 15:44.703
of placing singers in other
companies and, I don't know...

15:44.861 --> 15:49.833
An opera career is too much to
hope for, but it's all I ever hope for.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.915
Until today.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.207
How much money do you need?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.923
I'm still short about 500 quid.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.046
When is it?

16:03.212 --> 16:05.089
In three weeks.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.634
I'm thinking of selling my body.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.098
How will you get
the other 498 pounds?

16:10.261 --> 16:12.434
Aw. Thanks a lot.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.352
Yeah, 2 pounds... Is that it?
That's all I'm worth, 2 pounds?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.571
He was just mean, really.

16:24.734 --> 16:28.659
Shagged my best friend and then told
me it was because I was getting too...

16:28.821 --> 16:31.165
- It doesn't matter.
- Sounds like a tosser.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.747
Yeah. Enormous tosser.

16:33.910 --> 16:37.164
- Capital of Uruguay?
- Montevideo.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.583
Hey, not just a pretty face.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.631
I'm way over it.

16:42.835 --> 16:47.181
I don't need that much love. I don't
expect it, coming from where I do,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.718
but nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

16:49.884 --> 16:54.060
You gotta take chances sometimes, don't
you? It'd be brilliant to take a chance

16:54.222 --> 16:57.522
on something worthwhile for a change.
The Cuban missile crisis.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.145
If you could be anyone in
the world, who would you be?

17:01.312 --> 17:05.067
Um... Well, seeing as I'm a dead
ringer for Cameron Diaz...

17:07.234 --> 17:08.703
She's got her own career,

17:08.861 --> 17:13.492
famous boyfriends,
and an arse I'd sell my mum for.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.827
- You?
- Martina Navratilova.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.001
- Serious?
- Eighteen grand slams.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.790
Oh, right.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.845
I wouldn't be anybody else.
I just wanna be myself.

17:26.002 --> 17:28.597
- No, you've gotta be someone.
- I don't want to.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.100
That confident, are we?

17:31.259 --> 17:32.886
No, on the contrary.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.645
If I was someone else,
I wouldn't be here with you.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.365
Hello, Paul.
What are you doing here?

17:51.195 --> 17:53.914
- Is this...? This is! You are.
- I am...?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.121
- She is.
- You're a girl.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.833
- Why do people keep saying that?
- This is Julz.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.918
- And you are...?
- Hydrangea.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.673
- Hi.
- Is that a unicorn?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.926
- Uh...
- Oh, you must be the...

18:05.084 --> 18:07.963
Have you signed up for the contest?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.847
- What contest?
- What contest?

18:10.006 --> 18:13.556
- No point. I've got it all sewn up.
- Biggest twat in the world?

18:13.801 --> 18:17.522
- Most perfunctory love-maker?
- Actually, the annual talent contest.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.523
- Spottiest back?
- Laugh at me now.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.810
You won't be when I do
my comedy routine.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.149
- Three hundred pounds for the winner.
- Is it?

18:24.312 --> 18:27.191
Come on, Seinfeld.
You can wash my motor scooter.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.279
- Is that code?
- Don't be a prick.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.202
All right.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.704
- See you tomorrow, Pottsy.
- See you.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.366
- That's Braddon. He's my boss.
- No way.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.705
The less you think about him,
the better.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.291
- What time's your train?
- Ten to.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.048
- What time is it now?
- Oh.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.958
- Quarter to.
- Right. Come on.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.174
Oh, God. We've gotta go.
We've gotta get a move on here.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.471
Come on.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.659
- I've had a lovely day.
- I've had the best time.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.789
So, I'll see you
when you get back?

19:17.448 --> 19:20.122
- From where?
- From Venice, of course.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.911
Well, that could be years.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.708
Nonsense. You're gonna win
that talent competition.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.671
Listen,
if the next time we speak,

19:27.833 --> 19:31.178
you're not ringing me
from a gondola in Venice, then...

19:31.379 --> 19:34.132
Well, you'll never
have another one of these.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.986
- See you, Brad.
- Bye, Cameron.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.505
<i>This is gold dust,
this stuff. This bit's classic, OK?</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:51.417
Belly-button fluff.
Why is it always blue?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.554
- It's always blue!
- Fire at will, boys!

20:55.713 --> 20:58.967
Even if I've been wearing a red top or...
All right.

20:59.133 --> 21:03.434
No matter what, it's always blue.
Hilarious, isn't it?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.976
Thanks very much. I'm Braddon
Evans. Peace out.

21:13.022 --> 21:16.322
I bet Billy Connolly is
shaking in his boots right now.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.488
- Port Talbot's answer to Norman Wisdom.
- Went well.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.032
- What are you wearing?
- I'm Pavarotti as Canio in <i>Pagliacci.</i>

21:23.240 --> 21:26.244
I don't understand what that means.
You just made noises.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.459
It's a character that...
It doesn't matter.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.716
Next, singing... Blimey.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.336
"Vesti la giubba."

21:36.253 --> 21:39.598
- We have the vocal stylings of Paul Potts.
- That's you.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.806
Next thing you'll tell me, we've got
Robert Mugabe doing the juggling.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.723
That is so obvious.
I could've come up with that.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.983
I chose not to.
That's the difference.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.893
- Off you go.
- I'm gonna be sick.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.655
- Is he coming or what?
- He can't get through the door!

21:54.939 --> 21:57.237
- Go on, Tubsy!
- Seriously, bud.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.778
- You've gotta get on! Get on now!
- I can't do it. Oh, my God.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.243
What are you wearing?

22:07.409 --> 22:10.208
Somebody call the zoo.
There's a panda on the loose!

22:10.371 --> 22:13.466
Great buns just like Michelin Man!

22:13.624 --> 22:15.968
Somebody chuck him a biscuit!

22:16.168 --> 22:19.843
Get off the stage,
man, your pies are ready!

22:20.005 --> 22:22.849
What are you gonna
sing, "Tears of a Clown"?

22:24.301 --> 22:27.305
Maybe he's gonna
eat the microphone.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.360
That's not my song.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.118
That's not me.
That's not my music.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.000
Hey, quiet, man!
Let the pregnant lady sing!

22:51.453 --> 22:54.707
Oh, my God,
he's swallowed Pavarotti!

24:08.572 --> 24:11.951
Come on! That's my boy! Pottsy!

24:18.582 --> 24:20.459
Thank you. Cheers.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.173
- Well done!
- Thanks so much.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.885
Thank you. Cheers. Oh, thanks.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.390
Thanks very much. Cheers.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.926
- Well done, I suppose.
- Thanks, mate.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.891
You're ahead of your time.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.852
They'll only learn to
appreciate me when I'm dead.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.733
- It'll be easier for me then.
- Can't you be kind?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.896
I'm depressed and hopeless.
Self-esteem's at its lowest.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.485
You're describing symptoms
of being your girlfriend.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.576
Girlfriend?

24:43.602 --> 24:45.722
Look who it is, the
big star of the night.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.370
Hello, Pottsy.
Who you supposed to be, then?

24:48.529 --> 24:50.998
- Casper the obese ghost?
- Get off me!

24:55.244 --> 24:57.450
Looks like I'm the
winner of this contest.

24:57.476 --> 24:58.398
Give it back!

24:58.539 --> 25:01.213
I didn't catch that.
You'll have to sing louder.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.252
I said give it back!

25:06.088 --> 25:08.182
My turn, is it?
You're gonna pay for that.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.093
May the Flame of
Arveron sustain me!

25:20.477 --> 25:21.820
Remember this?

25:21.979 --> 25:23.902
No.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.580
- Where the hell did you get that from?
- From me, mate.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.743
That was brilliant. Would have
made Pete Townshend proud.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.204
Now you want to keep smashing it,
then set it on fire.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.087
- You all right?
- Yeah. Let's just get out of here.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.685
- Truce?
- I'll have you for this.

25:57.598 --> 26:00.272
Can I have another go?
That was exhilarating.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.981
No.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.862
Leave him.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.982
Cheers, then.

26:07.733 --> 26:12.034
- That was incredible. You saved us.
- That's got me all hot and bothered.

26:12.196 --> 26:15.791
My car's around the corner.
We can be at my place in four minutes.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.044
You were stupendous tonight, Pottsy!
You're my hero!

26:19.203 --> 26:20.546
Mine too!

26:21.038 --> 26:22.711
See you.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.391
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Cameron.</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:44.187
- Who is this?
<i>- It's me, Paul.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:51.903
- I knew a Paul once, but...
<i>- Aw. Come on, you can't be mad at me.</i>

26:52.111 --> 26:54.990
Three weeks goes
way past playing hard to get.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.625
It's been 19 days, and you said
not to call until I was settled.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.457
<i>- Where?</i>
- In Venice.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.714
<i>- You're really there?</i>
- I can hardly believe it myself.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.590
But I'm actually here.

27:05.749 --> 27:09.549
<i>You're serious?
You're not having me on?</i>

27:09.711 --> 27:14.262
No, it's true. I'm calling you now
from the middle of the Grand Canal.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.272
<i>Well, tell me everything.</i>

27:22.099 --> 27:25.194
<i>Where are you staying?
Have you got a nice place?</i>

27:25.352 --> 27:28.401
<i>Well, it's not big,
but it's got a real Venetian balcony</i>

27:28.564 --> 27:31.443
<i>on a quiet little Venetian street.</i>

27:34.361 --> 27:37.365
<i>The school is brilliant.
It's an old 16th century palazzo</i>

27:37.531 --> 27:39.829
<i>right in the heart of the city.</i>

28:02.973 --> 28:07.228
<i>Every morning starts off
with four hours of intensive Italian.</i>

28:15.527 --> 28:17.575
<i>Which I find comes quite easily.</i>

28:19.281 --> 28:22.455
<i>In the afternoons, we study
opera with Signora Fiorentino,</i>

28:22.618 --> 28:25.417
<i>who has almost nothing
but praise for my technique.</i>

28:34.713 --> 28:36.715
<i>Once in a while,
we practise stage combat.</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:41.888
Ow! It's meant to be acting class, not
stabbing class. That really hurt. Jesus.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.349
And the food? It must be incredible.

28:45.807 --> 28:49.607
<i>Oh. It's bellissimo.
So fresh and authentic.</i>

28:49.770 --> 28:52.068
<i>There's nothing else quite like it.</i>

28:52.231 --> 28:54.950
<i>Not to mention the art
and the architecture.</i>

28:55.108 --> 28:57.861
<i>Which is amazing.
I visited a museum yesterday</i>

28:58.028 --> 29:00.872
<i>that had over 50
paintings by Tintoretto.</i>

29:01.031 --> 29:04.285
<i>I think Mum's got one of
them in the downstairs loo.</i>

29:06.453 --> 29:10.833
<i>And the people?
Have you made loads of friends?</i>

29:10.999 --> 29:14.594
<i>Oh, yeah, loads. There's
parties every night. It's non-stop.</i>

29:21.218 --> 29:24.017
<i>So, do you miss me?</i>

29:24.179 --> 29:25.522
Terribly.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.024
Good.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.123
Here is some very exciting news.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.966
In two weeks, Il Maestro, Pavarotti,
will visit the school

29:56.503 --> 29:58.722
to teach a master class.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.929
Unfortunately, he has not the time
to hear everyone sing.

30:02.134 --> 30:06.184
So, we will choose for him the best
students from our recital of duets.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.980
The most outstanding
will sing solo for the Maestro.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.507
I want to win.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.177
- Right. Yeah, that would be lovely.
- No, you don't understand.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.971
I want to win.

30:47.137 --> 30:50.311
I'm not so sure it's important
for you to sing for Pavarotti.

30:50.474 --> 30:54.149
No, it is. It's important. It's the
most important thing in the world.

30:54.311 --> 30:58.191
To sing well for Pavarotti can make
your whole career. Do you understand?

30:58.357 --> 30:59.734
Right. Yeah.

31:00.317 --> 31:04.572
So, if you screw it up, I'll get
my brothers to hurt you. Badly.

31:27.886 --> 31:32.733
No, no, no, Paulo, no. Look at
Alessandra, not at your shoes.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.566
You are Rodolfo. She is Mimi.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.819
This is... How you say?
The spark.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.742
The moment of love creation.

31:46.196 --> 31:49.040
O lovely girl.
O sweet face.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.882
I see you in a dream,
I will dream forever.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.920
- You have been in love, yes?
- Yeah.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.885
And how did you
show your girl this?

32:05.173 --> 32:10.600
I bought her a torch. The florist
was shut. It was a rechargeable one.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.106
Alessandra is a
beautiful girl, no?

32:13.682 --> 32:17.357
- Yep.
- Look. With your eyes.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.406
Mm. Yeah, no, she's very pretty.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.871
Is OK.

32:32.075 --> 32:35.750
You have two weeks before
the recital. Two weeks to make us believe

32:35.912 --> 32:38.831
that you are more in love than
any two people have ever been in love.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.165
Dream only of each other.
Think of nothing and nobody else.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.554
Again.

32:46.798 --> 32:51.224
Paulo. Will you travel
for the <i>fine settimana?</i>

32:52.137 --> 32:55.516
Uh, the weekend? No, I was
gonna stay here and practise.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.811
Don't you want to
practise together with me?

32:59.394 --> 33:02.318
Together?
No, well, yeah, that'd be great.

33:02.481 --> 33:06.406
We can get to know each other.
I can take you home to meet my family.

33:06.568 --> 33:10.072
- Does that include your brothers?
- Don't worry, they'll love you.

33:10.238 --> 33:13.708
- You said they were gonna kill me.
- No one is going to kill you.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.790
- I was joking.
- No, you weren't.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.668
I am her dad.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.521
Mama...

34:16.679 --> 34:18.023
Shut up.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.243
Hm?

34:51.422 --> 34:54.643
She only means to say
you should be true to yourself.

34:54.801 --> 34:59.102
It's what she always taught me,
and what I've taught my children.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.518
Alessandra, for example,
she is a great singer.

35:02.684 --> 35:05.813
We believe in her
so she can believe in herself.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.902
That's what families do.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.334
To Paul!

37:27.662 --> 37:29.710
You were amazing tonight.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.346
I can't...

37:37.130 --> 37:38.473
What's wrong?

37:39.632 --> 37:41.509
Nothing, it's...

37:41.676 --> 37:43.770
You don't like to kiss me?

37:43.928 --> 37:47.728
No, I do. I like...
I really like... It's just...

37:50.101 --> 37:51.694
You have a girlfriend at home.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.233
Yeah, a girlfriend.
Or at least, I think I do.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.165
Signora Fiorentino was right.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.459
You have a wonderful heart, Paulo.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.275
- Sod off.
- It's true.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.905
<i>You're not taking the piss?</i>

38:36.064 --> 38:39.443
I swear I'm not.
I'm gonna sing for him tomorrow.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.907
Paul, you must be so nervous.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.538
I'm petrified.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.661
You'll be fine. You just
need to breathe on stage and...

38:48.827 --> 38:51.501
Julz, can I tell you something?

38:52.163 --> 38:56.213
Yeah? Go on, say it.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.137
I wish you were here.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.348
So do I.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.597
I'll bring you back one day.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.887
<i>Promise.</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:06.613
- I wouldn't want to have to follow that.
- No. Me neither.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.631
I see you've gone
for the Nokia 6020.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.183
Brilliant phone.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.646
Not cheap, mind, but I doubt
you worry about that.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.400
How are you finding the
battery life on it? Is it...?

41:27.402 --> 41:30.576
We're gonna...
Should we...? Yeah? OK.

41:48.506 --> 41:52.010
Can I...? Sorry. Sorry, can I...?

42:06.983 --> 42:08.326
Sorry.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.690
Stop. Please, no more.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.271
You are very nervous, no?

42:41.434 --> 42:42.777
Very.

42:42.935 --> 42:46.189
I can hear it in your voice.
You lack too much the confidence.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.700
Rodolfo could never run out
of breath like this on <i>che giova.</i>

42:50.526 --> 42:54.997
To sing opera, you need to
steal the heart of the audience,

42:55.156 --> 42:58.831
and you cannot steal unless you
have the nerves of the thief.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.248
For me, you are not
yet an opera singer.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.214
Not yet for sure.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.754
And maybe never.

43:43.871 --> 43:48.001
Now we add the iron ore,
limestone and coke.

43:48.167 --> 43:51.888
Bake up to about 2000 degrees,
and Bob's your uncle.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.684
Come on, boys, let's show you
how we make the gingerbread.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.482
John. John, hang on a minute.

44:12.066 --> 44:15.445
These ovens are only
about 1000 degrees,

44:15.611 --> 44:19.366
so consider yourself lucky
if you end up here.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.455
Come on, boys, straight through.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.563
Cary Morris tells me
you walked off the job.

44:50.730 --> 44:52.732
I can't do it, Dad.
I can't work here.

44:52.899 --> 44:54.526
Oh, too physical, is it?

44:55.443 --> 44:58.868
Don't get to wear enough makeup
or hear enough applause?

44:59.447 --> 45:02.121
There's nobody screaming "encore"?

45:03.284 --> 45:06.663
You have had your great adventure,
which is more than I ever had.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.127
But this is your life now.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.713
Work hard, get a few
quid in your pocket,

45:11.876 --> 45:14.174
grab a few pints
before you go home, and have a...

45:14.337 --> 45:16.055
Hey!

45:16.923 --> 45:18.891
Coming for a pint
or what, Roland?

45:19.050 --> 45:21.724
Bring Paul along, he'll sing
us one of his Italian songs.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.233
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right, nice one.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.860
Now, you listen.

45:33.022 --> 45:36.492
There's a waiting list as long
as a donkey's knob for your job.

45:36.651 --> 45:39.154
I was able to square things
with Cary this once,

45:39.320 --> 45:43.496
but you screw up again and you'll be
out on the street in more ways than one.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.285
Do I make myself clear?

45:47.620 --> 45:49.714
- Do I?
- Yes.

46:13.813 --> 46:18.944
Right. Now, how far away from the house
will the telephone actually work?

46:19.110 --> 46:21.954
- As far as you like.
- Oh, rubbish.

46:22.113 --> 46:27.210
Last telephone we had, the cord wouldn't
even reach as far as the back door.

46:27.368 --> 46:29.666
This doesn't have a cord.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.540
What do you call this, then?

46:32.707 --> 46:35.677
Now, look here, we don't
take kindly to bullshitters.

46:35.835 --> 46:37.883
- No.
- That's because you're insane.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.097
- You can't say that to us!
- Oh!

46:40.256 --> 46:43.635
- How very rude!
- Come on, we're going somewhere else.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.522
- Some people have no manners.
- Come here again...

46:47.680 --> 46:50.604
Customer service skills are
improving by the day, I see.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.810
Hello, Pottsy.
When'd you get back?

46:53.352 --> 46:55.650
- Couple of weeks.
- How was it?

46:57.732 --> 46:59.075
It didn't really...

46:59.233 --> 47:00.985
Oh, dear.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.246
Come on, let's get out of here.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.074
Blast furnace slag removal.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.743
Christ, could anything
sound more glamorous?

47:08.909 --> 47:10.377
Maybe I'll get used to it.

47:10.536 --> 47:15.337
Maybe I'll grow a third hand so I can
surf online and wank at the same time.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.669
- I thought you already had.
- No.

47:17.835 --> 47:22.181
You've gotta be born with it.
Same as you were born to sing.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.762
You're the lucky one, Paul.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.435
You know what you were put
on this earth to do.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.596
You have an actual
talent for singing.

47:28.763 --> 47:31.266
- Not according to Pavarotti.
- Screw Pavarotti.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.935
He's nothing but a binge
eater with a comb-over.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.069
And my absolute hero.

47:36.228 --> 47:37.730
So, you choked.

47:37.897 --> 47:41.197
Everybody chokes sometimes.
It's not the end of the world.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.203
No, the end of the
world's right there.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.330
Slag removal.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.537
Don't go back there
if you can help it.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.266
At least not while you
still have your voice

47:51.292 --> 47:53.317
and a girlfriend who
believes in you.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.423
I'm not sure I've even got that.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.176
Don't tell me you screwed
it up with Julz too?

48:01.337 --> 48:03.760
All right,
now you're a bloody loser.

48:27.446 --> 48:30.120
<i>Hi. It's Julz. Leave a
message after the tone.</i>

49:13.367 --> 49:16.291
There you are.
Thank you very much.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.387
Are you finding
everything you need, sir?

49:25.546 --> 49:27.640
Mm-hm. Yes, I'm good,
thank you very much.

49:27.882 --> 49:29.680
You're intending to buy something?

49:29.884 --> 49:34.105
Yeah, no, I am. That's... I wouldn't...
I'm here to get these, actually.

49:34.263 --> 49:36.106
This is what I'm...

49:37.725 --> 49:39.147
<i>Cashier Number 2, please.</i>

49:39.310 --> 49:43.690
These are the good ones, right?
Yep, ones and twos, so...

49:44.148 --> 49:46.901
That's me. I'm all done now,
thanks very much.

49:47.067 --> 49:50.321
<i>Cashier Number 5, please.</i>

49:53.324 --> 49:55.452
Oh, still no joy, Mrs Cosgrove?

49:55.618 --> 49:58.087
No. Still can't shift
a thing down there.

49:58.245 --> 50:01.044
It's like pushing a pineapple
down a hosepipe.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.717
<i>Cashier Number 1, please.</i>

50:05.169 --> 50:09.720
Right. Well, a couple more of these
and you'll be right as rain. All right.

50:09.882 --> 50:12.635
<i>Cashier Number 1, please.</i>

50:14.845 --> 50:16.893
<i>Cashier Number 5, please.</i>

50:22.520 --> 50:24.818
Julz, I'm so sorry.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.323
Is that all today, sir?

50:26.482 --> 50:29.452
- I'm an idiot, and I...
- It's 9.99, please.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.868
I just wanted to be able
to speak to you about...

50:33.280 --> 50:36.284
- Just let me explain, please,
- Nine ninety-nine.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.748
Exactly why I've been
doing this, all right?

50:38.911 --> 50:41.539
<i>Cashier Number 5, please.</i>

50:48.254 --> 50:51.303
Hi. Do you want a bag?

50:52.258 --> 50:55.228
<i>Cashier Number 3, please.</i>

50:59.390 --> 51:03.065
<i>- Cashier Number 4, please.</i>
- Your change, all right?

51:03.686 --> 51:07.486
- Thank you.
- <i>Cashier Number 1, please.</i>

51:08.148 --> 51:10.571
<i>Cashier Number 5, please.</i>

51:18.117 --> 51:20.693
I know you're mad, but
if you'll listen...

51:20.719 --> 51:21.737
Fifty pence.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.464
- Will you listen to me for one...
- It's a pound.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.138
There is a legitimate
reason why I didn't...

51:27.164 --> 51:29.119
Will you please
give me a chan...?

51:29.253 --> 51:32.223
- Julz, stop.
- No. I trusted you.

51:32.381 --> 51:34.725
I thought what we
had meant something.

51:34.883 --> 51:38.228
Look, I never
wanna see you again.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.647
Do you have a
Boots Advantage Card?

51:42.683 --> 51:44.310
No.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.738
<i>Cashier Number 5, please.</i>

51:47.896 --> 51:49.990
Are you serious?

51:50.149 --> 51:54.199
If there's no problem, sir, I'm gonna
have to ask you to move it along.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.544
I'm sorry.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.513
Hi.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.600
Thank you.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.436
See you tomorrow.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.112
I messed up. All right?

52:29.271 --> 52:31.990
Pavarotti tore me to shreds.
I choked.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.278
I couldn't bear to hear your
voice knowing I'd let you down.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.242
You think that's what let me down?

52:37.404 --> 52:40.533
- I don't know, I just felt...
- You ever think how I felt?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.372
Wondering what happened to you?

52:42.660 --> 52:45.914
I was falling in love with you.
When you got back from Venice,

52:46.080 --> 52:48.292
I was gonna knock on
your door and say,

52:48.318 --> 52:50.861
"Let's give it a go.
Let's move in together."

52:51.001 --> 52:54.551
I had my bags packed and I was
waiting for you to call, and nothing.

52:54.713 --> 52:56.090
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry.

52:56.256 --> 52:59.476
- No, I'm done with you.
- Julz.

52:59.635 --> 53:01.387
- Julz, please.
- Leave me alone!

53:01.553 --> 53:03.396
Julz!

53:04.640 --> 53:05.983
Wait!

53:06.141 --> 53:07.768
Julz!

53:12.523 --> 53:19.748
<i>Thou art my thoughts
my present and my future</i>

53:19.947 --> 53:23.577
<i>Thou art my heart supreme</i>

53:23.742 --> 53:27.337
<i>Its only joy</i>

53:27.996 --> 53:34.470
<i>I love thee more than
any earthly creature</i>

53:34.628 --> 53:37.347
<i>I love thee, dear</i>

53:37.506 --> 53:40.134
<i>I love thee, dear</i>

53:40.300 --> 53:46.558
<i>I love thee now and for eternity</i>

53:46.724 --> 53:49.694
<i>I love thee now</i>

53:50.102 --> 53:57.111
<i>And for eternity</i>

54:00.154 --> 54:02.202
So, you can sing, then?

54:03.699 --> 54:05.497
Yeah, I can.

54:06.118 --> 54:08.120
I can for you.

54:47.451 --> 54:53.800
<i>For to whatever fate
God's will may do me</i>

54:53.957 --> 54:56.585
<i>I love thee, dear</i>

54:56.752 --> 54:58.846
<i>I love thee, dear</i>

54:59.004 --> 55:03.760
<i>I love thee now and for eternity</i>

55:04.384 --> 55:12.189
<i>I love thee now and for eternity</i>

55:41.171 --> 55:43.014
<i>And hurt you</i>

55:43.966 --> 55:45.593
You fancy a drink?

55:45.759 --> 55:47.727
Champagne, please.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.938
Back in a flash, Mrs Potts.

55:50.097 --> 55:51.770
Why, thank you very much, Mr Potts.

55:56.353 --> 55:59.323
Did I ever tell you how I fractured
Gareth Edwards' clavicle?

55:59.481 --> 56:01.483
- The Gareth Edwards?
- When I was your age.

56:01.650 --> 56:04.278
- I was running down...
- I was running down...

56:04.444 --> 56:07.368
Oh, you bastard! Having me on!

56:07.531 --> 56:09.329
Champagne and a lager, please.

56:09.491 --> 56:10.913
Paul. Paul.

56:11.201 --> 56:15.877
- You remember Bill and Matthew?
- Paul and me went to school together.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.759
Felicitations and all that.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.218
Thanks.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.884
Surprised to see you getting married.
I wasn't even sure they'd dropped yet.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.568
He's joking. We're all three
or four sheets to the wind.

56:35.726 --> 56:38.104
- How could you invite him?
- How could I not?

56:38.270 --> 56:41.649
He married your mother's niece
Julie last April.

56:41.815 --> 56:43.567
And besides, he's a good lad.

56:43.734 --> 56:47.079
He plays rugby, he's not
afraid of hard work...

56:47.738 --> 56:50.457
- What's all the bad blood between you?
- Not today.

56:50.616 --> 56:52.459
Wait, love. Go on, tell him.

56:52.618 --> 56:53.961
I say, young man,

56:54.119 --> 56:58.124
I don't know where you found it,
but your vocal control has improved.

56:58.290 --> 57:01.965
Thanks very much. I spent time
in Italy, but I don't really sing...

57:02.127 --> 57:04.255
- Tell him.
- I'm commissioned to conduct

57:04.421 --> 57:07.095
a production of Aida in Bath.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.931
And you, sir, would make
a wonderful Radamés.

57:10.844 --> 57:13.472
- Are you serious?
- There's no pay, I'm afraid.

57:13.639 --> 57:14.982
Well, now, hold on...

57:15.140 --> 57:16.517
- He'll take it.
- I'd love to.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.731
Oh, do be quiet.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.237
They're playing our song,

57:20.395 --> 57:24.946
so stop moaning and start thrusting
your pelvis in my general direction.

57:26.844 --> 57:28.004
Congratulations.

57:28.153 --> 57:32.954
Thank you so much. That's the best news.
I can't quite believe that. Thank you.

57:44.836 --> 57:47.760
I mean, the lead in <i>Aida.</i>

57:48.507 --> 57:52.353
I can't believe it. I don't know
how this day can get any better.

57:52.511 --> 57:56.687
Well, um,
I can think of something.

58:00.936 --> 58:04.736
Oh, hang on, I got you a surprise.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.445
Oh.

58:07.776 --> 58:09.323
What is it?

58:12.197 --> 58:15.451
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

58:15.617 --> 58:19.338
- Where did you find this?
- That's not even the best bit.

58:21.540 --> 58:24.168
- What is it?
- A bike.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.927
Just open it.

58:33.010 --> 58:37.106
- Puccini?
- It's an original recording from...

58:37.264 --> 58:39.437
Oh. Um...

58:39.599 --> 58:40.942
From...

58:41.101 --> 58:44.748
From La Scala, Milan
on April 25th, 19...

58:44.774 --> 58:47.725
1926, conducted by Toscanini.

58:49.901 --> 58:53.405
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

59:02.748 --> 59:06.173
This was recorded
before Pavarotti was even born.

59:06.334 --> 59:10.214
It's a really difficult aria,
especially at the end. It's...

59:12.716 --> 59:14.389
Thank you.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.053
Thank you so much.

59:29.649 --> 59:31.697
What's he saying?

59:34.154 --> 59:39.251
He's saying "nessun dorma".
"None shall sleep."

59:39.409 --> 59:42.709
Calaf has been rejected
by the woman that he loves.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.748
- She's a princess.
- Ugh.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.589
Why does it always have
to be about a princess?

59:47.751 --> 59:51.005
Why can't checkout girls have
love stories written about them?

59:51.171 --> 59:55.051
Yeah, I don't think they had
checkout girls in the 1700s, babe.

59:55.217 --> 59:57.185
Help me with this, will you?

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.852
If she can guess
his name by dawn,

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.612
she gets to cancel the wedding

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.399
and she can chop his head off.

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.614
Sounds a bit more exciting than
calling for a clean-up on Aisle 7.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.204
- There you go. That's it. You're done.
- OK.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.379
Right, turn away, then.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:26.331
Right.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.969
My secret is hidden within me.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.588
None shall know my name.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:38.852
On your mouth, I will say
it when the light shines.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.448
And my kiss

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.658
will dissolve the silence

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.158
that makes you mine.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.545
So, kiss me.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.688
I've never done this before.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.479
It's OK.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.894
I've had thousands.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.565
I'm joking.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.876
So, what happens to them?

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.464
Well, she tortures all his friends

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.350
who refuse to reveal his name.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.897
And then at dawn,

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:10.227
he kisses her.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.774
And she falls madly
in love with him.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:30.043
Right, so that's the bit where I come up.
I come up to about here, yeah?

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:33.379
- A step downstage perhaps. And then...
- Uh-huh.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.545
That's when I take her in my arms
and start to seduce her.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.759
While singing brilliantly,
of course.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.299
Well, of course, yeah.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:24.093
- Drink with me, Paul.
- What?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.804
Drink with me.
Come on, drink with me.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.938
It's the morning.
What are you doing?

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:30.815
- Drowning my sorrows.
- Why?

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.022
- She's left me.
- Who?

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.482
Hydrangea.
She left me this morning.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.613
She has to be at work at 7.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.900
- What did you do?
- Got down on one knee

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.659
and asked her to marry me.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.161
Oh, wow.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.870
I know. I wish I could take
it all back, but I can't.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.409
- Get out!
- Braddon.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.873
- Get out!
- I'm so sorry, Mrs Petersham.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:53.289
She was coming back
for an upgrade.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.799
Are you serious?
That's why she left?

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.459
I rushed her.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:00.299
She was always saying she
didn't want to be rushed,

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.760
but maybe she didn't
want to be loved.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.425
Maybe she didn't know
how to be loved.

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:08.641
Maybe none of us do.
Drink with me, Paul, please.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:13.859
- I can't. I've got the show tomorrow.
- Rejected again. Cast adrift.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.487
A lone sailor looking for
love on the open seas.

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.615
All right, maybe I'll
just have a sip, then.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.491
Ugh. That's... Ow.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.536
- What is that?
- Créme de menthe.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:32.623
- Why are you drinking it?
- It reminds me of my childhood.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.217
Hello?

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.184
Radamés.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.185
Wherefore art thou?

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.899
Oh, my God.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.106
What's wrong? What's happened?

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:10.662
Right. Well, the good news is,

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:15.333
it has got nothing to do
with the créme de menthe.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.633
- And the not-good news?
- The appendix hasn't ruptured yet.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:23.045
- Oh, thank God.
- It is gonna have to come out.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.509
- Well, when?
- About an hour or so.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.596
- No, I can't.
- No, his opera opens tomorrow night.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.557
- Oh, fantastic. Which one?
- <i>Aida.</i>

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:36.065
Now, is that the one with Madonna?
It's got that lovely Latin flavour to it?

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:40.486
Well, singing is quite out
of the question, I'm afraid.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.823
I'm the lead,
I can't let everybody down.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.906
An appendectomy
is invasive surgery.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.698
If we leave it in, it's sure to
rupture, and that could be fatal.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.704
If we take it out,
any great effort like singing,

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:58.418
and you're liable to burst the stitches,
and that could cause irreparable damage.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.957
Well, how irreparable?

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:04.879
Well, it is possible that
singing won't be possible.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.007
Oh, that's that, then.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:13.307
To sing so soon after
surgery, well, it's...

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.349
- It's idiotic if you ask me.
- Yes, well, we didn't.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:19.108
We never have and
we're not going to.

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:21.440
Least we can do is support him,

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.447
no matter how much of
a pinhead he's being.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:29.073
I'll thank you both not to talk
about my husband in that way.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:32.489
Yes, you're right, love,
but it's just so... Oh.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.374
Why can't he just put
himself first for a change?

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.161
Because then he'd just
be like everyone else,

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.547
and he's not.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:45.423
You are a very lovely girl.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:49.556
I'd trade both my ears
for a pint right about now.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.942
- Right, Paul. You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.899
- The first act sounded bloody marvelous.
- Thanks.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.782
- Ready for the big duet?
- Mm.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:53.782
Paul! Paul!

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:55.288
Excuse me.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.977
- I don't believe it.
- What? What is it?

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:21.685
They've stopped the bleeding,
he's gonna be fine, but

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.816
they found a tumour
in his thyroid.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.899
His what?

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.608
In his throat.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.381
Look, I know you're frightened.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.962
And the fact that you
might never sing again

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.254
might be too much for you to bear,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:58.723
but I just want you to know that
even if you never even speak again,

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.979
I will do everything in my power

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.768
to fill our lives
with as much music

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:10.404
and love and happiness
as I can possibly manage.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.666
Thank you.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.133
Oh, come on, just one drink.

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:41.098
I swear we'll be home
in a half hour, right?

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.853
Thank you.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:52.229
Surprise!

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.274
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.534
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.243
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:04.455
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.547
For bravery and the rather
thickheaded willingness

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.050
to sacrifice himself
for his fellow man,

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:17.722
Bath Opera is proud to present you
with the first Golden Appendix Award.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.349
In hopes for a speedy
return to the stage.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.185
My God.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.733
Thank you so much.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.270
- Speak up.
- Can't hear you.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:35.156
How about you write it
down and I'll read it out?

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.824
"My whole life

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:45.037
"I've struggled to make friends.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.328
"Now I have an entire company.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:53.334
"From the bottom of my heart,

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.088
- "thank you."
- Aw.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.174
Next drink's on the company.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.215
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.054
Hip. hip, hooray!

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:06.180
Get me half a lager, babe.
I'm just going to the loo.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.313
So, how's he doing?

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.567
Well, he's heartbroken,

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:13.103
but we'll see.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:17.445
Here's the recording of Aida at least.
The one he made before the performance.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.951
He can have his voice back
whenever he likes.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.658
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, he'll love that.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.824
It's not about the individual,

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.708
it's about the Carphone
Warehouse family,

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:14.168
and I for one am thrilled to be
a part of that family, so thank you.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.048
- Who was that?
- Who was what?

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.843
- Who was that?
- That was just my boss

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.254
up at HQ in Croydon,
very wise man,

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.218
who's seen fit to give me a raise.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:27.010
A raise? Wha...? Why?

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.850
What do you mean, why?
I'm a stupendous manager.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.605
I feel a sudden urge to sing.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.563
Oh, God, please don't.
Don't take this the wrong way.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:39.071
I mean this in no way personally,
but you know you're a crap manager.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.029
You know that,
I know that, but if you must know,

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:46.488
over the last two quarters, our shop has
had the highest sales in all of Wales.

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:50.375
<i>The highest sales in all of Wales!</i>

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.787
Amazing. In the six months
since I got back from my surgery?

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:57.048
In which time I've kept the
shop open from 10 until 6.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.550
I put the ad in the local
paper and online...

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:03.555
All right, blimey! I'm trying to tell
you you're getting a raise as well.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.386
- Am I?
- Couple of quid an hour.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.016
You serious?

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:14.399
<i>- The highest sales in all of...!
- In all of Wales!</i>

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.320
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I can sing.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.861
- I can sing.
- You can sing.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.822
I can sing.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:29.535
<i>The highest sales in all of Wales!</i>

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.074
Little pitchy, up a half.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.997
<i>- The highest sales in all of Wales!
- The highest sales in all of Wales!</i>

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.086
He's back! He's back!

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.750
<i>I can sing!</i>

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:44.012
- Mrs Evans, I can sing!
- Jolly good.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.969
- Tell your mum I'll see her at bingo.
- Will do!

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:51.261
<i>In all of Wales!</i>

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:53.221
Julz! Julz,

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:56.311
- I can sing!
- What?

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:59.815
<i>I can sing!</i>

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:03.781
Oh, my God.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:11.827
You've shattered your collarbone, broken
four ribs and dislocated your pelvis.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:15.368
- But he'll be able...
- He won't be running a marathon soon.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:18.708
Hard to tell when he'll
even be back on his feet.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.877
Cameron?

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.673
Oh, you have gotta
stop doing this to me.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.704
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:55.283
Oh. Tired I am.
Today's been hectic.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.124
You all right?

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.672
Good day?

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.837
Same as yesterday, really.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:09.347
Oh, Paul, what's with all the
washing up? It's the one thing...

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.052
Sorry.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:13.889
Right.
Any idea what you want for tea?

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:16.308
Well, I just had a sandwich, so...

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.265
- Oh. Babe.
- What?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:24.192
It'd be nice to eat together for a change.
You're not gonna see me all weekend.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.355
- Why?
- Sean's asked me to do overtime,

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.025
and we can't afford for me not to.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.823
- This is ridiculous.
- Shut up.

01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:37.117
We can't do this every
time the door goes.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.536
If the bailiff comes,
they'll take the TV.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.330
If they do, they do.
I'm gonna answer it.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.419
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't you...!

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.926
No! Come back!
Julz, no! You're my wife!

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.884
Oh. It's just Braddon.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.804
- Tell him I'm not here.
- What?

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:56.970
- Tell him I've gone to Spain.
- I can actually hear you.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:01.732
Ta-da.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.859
Feast your eyes upon
the southwestern

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:06.316
district sub-manager
for Carphone Warehouse.

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:07.947
- You are not.
- I am.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.484
Jesus, your failure-to-success
ratio is miraculous.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.494
Carphone Warehouse recognises
talent when they see it.

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:18.078
Plus, the old district manager
died of a heart attack. High five.

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:21.161
Which means that I am
looking for someone

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:23.921
to fill these rather
spectacular, genuine leather,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.550
convenient Velcro-fastening boots-.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:30.712
I'm not sure I'm up to it.

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:33.722
Bollocks. You've been on
disability for over a year,

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:36.634
they've cut up most of your
credit cards, and poor Julz.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.351
Any time this year?

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:44.063
- You two back together?
- Been about a week now.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:47.900
Told her about the company Ford Mondeo
and she was putty in my hands.

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:49.689
Don't be a prick, Braddon.

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:52.575
- Sorry.
- So, you're leaving today?

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:57.284
I don't know if I can. You don't know how
many pills I have to take every day...

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:01.121
Paul, Paul, Paul.
I've created a legacy.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.752
I've established
a truly magical workplace.

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.084
I just can't hand
that on to anyone.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:10.297
Plus, we've signed up for an Elf
and Hobbit weekend in the Valleys.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.758
I'm gonna miss you, bud.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.890
You're my best mate.
There, I said it.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.600
Rubbish.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:21.262
Sub-uber-under district managers
don't have time for such emotions.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.896
It's district sub-manager,

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.729
and I'll be popping around
to check up on you.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.735
Make sure there's no
funny business going on.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.865
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:36.653
You've laid around too long, Pottsy.
Time to get on with it.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.617
Mad love.

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.826
- May the...
- Give it a bit more throttle.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.415
I know. May the...

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.330
Now rev it.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.466
- May... Ugh.
- Oh, for God's...

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.592
I'm missing
<i>Deal or No Deal</i> for this.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:55.004
There we are, then.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:57.597
May the Flame of
Arveron sustain you.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:14.717
- How was your first day, then?
- Yeah, brilliant.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.297
Any luck with the hiring?

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:22.967
No, but it'll be better when
we get an ad in the paper.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:14.728
Pressure caused the Number 5 Furnace
to literally split down the side.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:17.442
- Oh, my Lord.
- Molten steel running everywhere.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.026
Eighteen hundred degrees.

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:22.443
Damn near burnt half the machinery
before we got the fire out.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:25.453
- Anyone hurt?
- Billy Watkins was almost incinerated.

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:30.709
Lucky for him, Paul's friend, Matthew,
hoisted him out before the soup got him.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.671
- He's not my friend.
- He's a bloody hero.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.332
- Good for him.
- Anything exciting at the shop?

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:40.219
Hang on, love. Whatever
disagreements you had at school...

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.720
- Disagreements?
- Yes.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:45.509
- Disa...? Do you see that, Dad?
- Paul.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:49.679
That's from a chain wrapped around
his fist while two of his droogs held me.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.473
- I was 12.
- I don't remember that happening.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:56.940
What was it you said to me? If I lost a
couple of stone, I wouldn't provoke him.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.820
Maybe nothing's changed.

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:04.160
Life doesn't owe you any favours.
Don't you think it's time

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:07.197
you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
We've all got on.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:10.458
- What makes you different?
- You've got on with your life?

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:13.586
How many times do we have to
hear about Gareth Edwards?

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:17.214
You don't wake up and regret
not pushing yourself further?

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:18.716
You watch yourself.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:22.504
- I had a wife and child to support.
- I've been paying for it since.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:25.013
You didn't have the
courage to take a chance.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:27.971
What chance are you taking?
How brave are you being?

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:31.603
Moping at home while your wife
works two jobs to pay your rent.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.187
What's your dream? Employee of
the Month at Carphone Warehouse?

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:37.317
That's some dream.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:41.071
You are afraid to sing and
you're afraid to get past it,

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.358
so don't you lecture me
about giving up!

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:47.745
Come on, Yvonne, I'm not
sitting here listening to this.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.914
I'm sorry, Mum.

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:14.226
Right. So, if we consolidate it
all into one monthly payment,

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.730
it's 149 pound a month for
four and a half years.

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:19.689
And we've got council tax.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:23.238
- Don't know how we're gonna do this.
- We'll be fine.

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:25.946
- Maybe Dad was right.
- Oh, sod your dad.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.237
Oh, my God,
these bloody pop-ups.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.123
- Yeah, what is that?
- Some talent competition

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.786
where the best performer in
Britain gets 100,000 pounds.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:40.001
Well, Robbie Williams
is gonna win that, isn't he?

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.883
Yeah, I think it's for
amateurs, babe.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:46.841
Shame you stopped singing, then.
You could have won that laughing.

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:06.649
Well, it's cheaper
than a lottery ticket.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:11.120
- You serious?
- I don't know, am I? Am I being stupid?

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:13.747
No. No, no, do it.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:15.908
No, forget it.

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:18.084
You've got a wonderful voice.

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:19.870
I had a wonderful voice.

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.165
I heard you the other
day in the shower.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.505
You still sound beautiful to me.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.304
It would be good to sing
in front of an audience again.

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:32.592
- I could probably move on after that.
- Right, so do it.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.728
I just can't bear
to be humiliated.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:40.061
- Not again.
- You won't. You won't be humiliated.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:43.519
- Toss a coin.
- What?

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:47.861
Toss a coin. Heads, I press "send,"
tails, we forget all about it.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.821
Right.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.464
Oh, my...!

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:08.298
- I can't believe you just did that.
- What are you gonna sing?

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.853
How long's it been?

01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:22.186
- Nearly two years.
- Hm. I'd have guessed longer.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:59.429
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.723
Yes, please?

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.921
- Hi.
- They said yes!

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.257
<i>- What?
- Britain's Got Talent, they said yes!</i>

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.468
They want you
to audition this Saturday.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.891
<i>Babe, they want you to sing!</i>

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:44.564
Bugger.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.499
How are you feeling, then?

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:04.581
Like I shouldn't be doing this.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.837
Come on, you'll be great.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:10.541
Something bad's gonna happen.
It always does to me.

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:25.226
<i>Hello and welcome
to Britain's Got Talent,</i>

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:27.938
the show that finds
Britain's brightest new acts

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.569
and changes their life forever.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.565
Heading up the judging
panel is Mr Simon Cowell.

01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:38.656
Actress Amanda Holden is one of
the country's most loved actresses.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.420
Complete cock-up, I'm afraid.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:43.240
Simon tossed three acts,
everything's been bumped up.

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.080
Long as I've got time to warm up.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:47.210
- How long do you need?
- Ten minutes.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.212
Take away five
and you're perfect.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.874
- I'm on in five minutes?
- Four and a half.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.008
These should take
you to your seats.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:57.091
Follow us down the hall
and up the stairs. Come on.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:59.757
- This was a mistake.
- You can warm up in five.

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:02.802
- I haven't got enough time.
- We may have a problem.

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.938
We don't have a problem.
He can warm up in four minutes.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.440
He was born screaming
at the top of his lungs

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:10.851
and shattered half the
windows in Wales.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:15.614
I hardly think now, when he's been asked
to perform again, is the time to go silent.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:17.445
I think we're gonna be OK.

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:21.202
- It's been proved I'm not good enough.
- Proved by who, Pavarotti?

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.988
- Yeah.
- That was ages ago.

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:25.829
This is it. This is your chance.

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.164
- Four minutes, yes or no?
- Yes!

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:32.840
I'm really not ready.
I honestly need more time than this.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:38.295
- Hello. What's your name?
- I'm Michelle. These are my children.

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:41.682
Just get your puckered old bum
to a telly. Do you hear me?

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.140
Honestly.

01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:48.727
If he wasn't such an exquisite lover,
I'd have to leave the man.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:55.563
<i>Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun</i>

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.652
<i>Me, a name I call myself</i>

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:05.372
You look happy, Mrs Buncle.
They look completely miserable.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.373
The singing was terrible.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:11.287
- Can we make it their last performance?
- I can't do this.

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:15.673
He didn't have to be that cruel,
but he was right.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:19.462
- I surrender.
- You couldn't smile just once?

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:23.056
- Wouldn't wanna follow that.
- Thanks.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:25.350
I think Paul's next.

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:26.852
Oh, dear.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:30.890
For the next contestant, the world
of show biz seems a million miles away.

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:35.193
It's Paul, a mobile phone
salesman from South Wales.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.571
<i>By day I sell mobile phones,</i>

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:41.609
<i>but my dream is to spend my life
doing what I feel I was born to do.</i>

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.573
Juggling pies.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:46.238
<i>I've always wanted
a singing career.</i>

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:48.323
You gotta see this.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:51.539
Holy crap, Pottsy.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:54.375
<i>Confidence is...</i>

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.294
<i>Has always been
a difficult thing for me.</i>

01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:00.586
<i>I always find it difficult
to be confident in myself.</i>

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.004
<i>- I get nervous.
- Oh, gosh.</i>

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:06.641
<i>Every time I have to sing
in front of anyone, it's...</i>

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.053
<i>Nerves have got the best
of me in the past.</i>

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.722
<i>I wish I didn't have
them if I'm honest.</i>

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:15.768
<i>But the truth is, I've never felt
more nervous than I am today.</i>

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.566
Right, you're on.

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:27.079
You're on.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:32.208
One foot and then the other.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.961
Don't hold much hope for this.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:46.423
Good afternoon, I'm Paul.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.809
Paul. What are you
here for today, Paul?

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.679
To sing opera.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.988
OK, ready when you are.

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:12.661
So, you work at Carphone Warehouse,

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.162
and you did that.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.948
- I wasn't expecting that.
- Neither was I.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.538
This was a complete
breath of fresh air.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.749
I thought you were
absolutely fantastic.

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:28.839
You have an incredible voice.

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.087
I think if you keep singing like that,

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:35.384
you are gonna be one of the favourites
to win this whole competition.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:42.274
I think that we've got a
case of a little lump of coal here

01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:44.685
that's gonna turn into a diamond.

01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:49.526
OK, moment of truth, young man.

01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:53.159
- Piers?
- Absolutely, yes.

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:58.164
- Amanda?
- Yes.

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:03.044
Paul, you are through to the
next round. Congratulations.

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:05.546
Thank you.

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:19.311
That was really good. Well done.

01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:21.934
Well done, son!

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:23.644
Bloody wonderful.

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.985
You're all right.

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:50.217
What kind of poof sings opera? Not
exactly a chip off the old block, is he?

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:53.345
- A bicycle chain?
- Well, it was only kids, like.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:01.178
- Get him out of my sight.
- Not laughing anymore.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:04.268
Come on, boys, the drinks are on me.

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:13.152
<i>As it turns out, I made it
to the semi-final and the final.</i>

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:17.077
<i>And the judges were right. I did
go on to win Britain's Got Talent.</i>

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:21.448
<i>And in the hectic weeks and months
that followed, I recorded my first album,</i>

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:26.040
<i>went on my first record tour, and was
even invited to sing for the queen,</i>

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:29.297
<i>which allowed us to pay off our
debts and still have enough</i>

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:33.585
<i>to buy a nice little house back in Port
Talbot, where Julz and I still live.</i>

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:37.096
Here you go.
Freshly pressed.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:38.802
Thanks.

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:45.138
There's, uh, something
I want to tell you.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:50.106
I know I haven't always been
the best of fathers.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:54.819
- Dad, you don't have to say...
- Shut up, let me do the singing for once.

01:34:56.149 --> 01:35:00.404
The only real measure
of a father's success

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.915
is by how far his children
end up surpassing him in life.

01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:08.203
And you,

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:11.965
you can be very,
very proud of yourself.

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:16.837
Come on, you two.
We'll keep the queen waiting.

01:35:21.174 --> 01:35:24.144
And now,
from the Royal Albert Hall,

01:35:24.302 --> 01:35:26.771
<i>the winner of Britain's Got Talent</i>

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.480
in his first performance
for Her Majesty the queen.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:33.270
An extraordinary singer
whose first album

01:35:33.436 --> 01:35:37.566
has already sold over two million
copies and reached number one...

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:40.576
- You nervous?
- Always.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:45.244
Hey, one foot, then the other.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:50.996
- Go on.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:53.540
please give a warm welcome

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:57.085
to Mr Paul Potts.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:03.384
<i>The truth is, I'm still just that
little boy from Wales who wanted to sing,</i>

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:06.311
<i>though I was persuaded
to get a new haircut,</i>

01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:08.096
<i>buy some new clothes,</i>

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:11.642
<i>and, oh, yeah, make one
other small change.</i>

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:24.780
<i>In the years since then, Julz and I have
travelled together all over the world.</i>

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:30.411
<i>But there's one special place
I always wanted her to see.</i>

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:37.019
You've gotta feed the
birds for good luck.

01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:38.740
Can we get any luckier?

01:36:41.379 --> 01:36:43.302
<i>So, there it is.</i>

01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:46.093
<i>The whole story.</i>

01:36:47.093 --> 01:36:49.596
<i>The opera of my life.</i>

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:55.606
<i>Not a bad one, is it?</i>
