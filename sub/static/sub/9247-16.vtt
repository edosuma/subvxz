00:07.094 --> 00:08.965
This is gonna be great
living down here.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.054
Like having our own
little apartment.

00:11.141 --> 00:14.840
Except the drunk upstairs
neighbors are my mom and sister.

00:14.927 --> 00:18.061
Hey, if they were sober,
they'd probably charge us rent.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.454
What are you doing
with all your clothes?

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
They're going to Goodwill.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.413
Now that I've dropped those
41 pounds

00:22.500 --> 00:24.502
it's time to switch
from clothes that conceal

00:24.589 --> 00:25.895
to clothes that reveal.

00:25.982 --> 00:29.072
Oh-oh. So now it's 41 pounds?

00:29.159 --> 00:31.335
Right before bed,
you said 40 and a half.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.424
I know, but I had my
flying dream last night

00:33.511 --> 00:36.645
and I must have flapped off
that extra half pound.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.255
Well, based on your snoring

00:38.342 --> 00:41.128
it sounded like you got
sucked into a jet engine.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.912
Either way, it's 41.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.914
And I'm very happy for you.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.395
But you might want to consider,
you know

00:47.482 --> 00:49.092
hanging on to a couple of items

00:49.179 --> 00:52.182
just until you're through
Girl Scout cookie season.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.010
Nope. Thin Mints be damned.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.839
I'm moving forward into a new
world and never going back.

00:56.926 --> 01:00.103
That's why the Conquistadors
burned their boats.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.888
Yeah, but they kept their pants.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.499
Hey, you know what,
I was thinking, tonight

01:04.586 --> 01:05.630
you and I could go to the mall

01:05.717 --> 01:07.458
and maybe
buy me something slinky.

01:07.545 --> 01:10.418
Ooh, slinky.
Fun for a girl and a boy.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.462
Hey, this is New Mike.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.898
He likes to dress nice

01:12.985 --> 01:14.509
and make himself pretty
for the people.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.728
Give the people what they want.

01:16.815 --> 01:19.122
So I'm guessing this is bye-bye
to your stretch pants

01:19.209 --> 01:20.993
and aloha
to your Hawaiian shirts.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.518
They'll be having a hukilau
at the Goodwill tomorrow.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.650

01:50.545 --> 01:53.156
You know, if you really
want to lose weight

01:53.243 --> 01:55.289
you should try Carl's "Extreme
Ultimate Body Workout."

01:55.376 --> 01:58.901
It's like P-90X, but more
focused on the buttocks.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.164
I knew I should've
brought my iPod.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.774
Oh, I apologize,
I thought you were actually

02:02.861 --> 02:04.254
serious about getting in shape.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.126
I like slow and steady.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.085
Start with 20 minutes of cardio,
then I hit the free weights

02:09.172 --> 02:10.608
followed by a ten-minute
cool down.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.089
Uh-huh. The same workout
my grandma does.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.743
Maybe you can take her
water aerobics class

02:14.830 --> 02:17.354
at the senior center.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.530
Biggs. Somebody told me
you were down here

02:19.617 --> 02:22.142
using the gym,
and I called him a liar.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.231
- Sir.
- At ease. Walk with me.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.710
How far we talking, sir?

02:25.797 --> 02:27.973
'Cause this is kind of
my cool down period.

If you need me, I'll be
over here doing squat-thrusts

02:30.367 --> 02:31.629
and one-armed pushups.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.588
Ain't no cool down in my world.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.896
You mind tossing the pill around
while we chitchat?

02:37.983 --> 02:40.072
Uh, absolutely. Sounds like fun.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.335
Oh!

really are heavy, huh?

Alright, heads up,
coming back at you.

Well, I know, sir,
I just didn't want to..

02:57.394 --> 02:58.439
Okay!

03:01.442 --> 03:03.531
What did you want to
chitchat about, sir?

03:03.618 --> 03:04.880
Well, as you know,
your mother and I have been

03:04.967 --> 03:06.577
seeing each other
for a few months now

03:06.664 --> 03:08.492
and I've grown
increasingly fond of her.

03:08.579 --> 03:11.408
It's a testament to your
forgiving nature, captain.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.064
Attagirl.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.936
Point being, I'd like
to give up police work

03:18.023 --> 03:22.811
and enjoy a quiet, peaceful life
with your mother at my side.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.118
And you really think
it's gonna go that way, huh?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.382
Tonight, I'm asking your mother
to marry me.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.384
If she says yes,
we'll sell her house

03:30.471 --> 03:33.909
and move to my condo
in Scottsdale.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.780
Hang on a second.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.000
Uh, you're gonna sell her house

03:38.087 --> 03:40.002
and move her all the way
to Arizona?

03:40.089 --> 03:42.047
Popping the question
after dinner.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.788
Maybe you and your wife
could drop by

03:43.875 --> 03:47.009
for a little celebratory toast.

03:47.096 --> 03:50.317
Yeah, sure.
Toast.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.275
I should really hit the showers.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.889
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.935
Hard to say, captain.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.893
You know, he is out of his
element down here.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.678
He's not like you or me.

for an older gentleman

04:08.335 --> 04:10.075

I can't believe
she's selling this place.

04:25.526 --> 04:26.788
You know I was born
in that house, Carl?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.398
I know.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.792
I've seen your teething marks
on the banister.

04:30.879 --> 04:34.361
Look like a bear
got hold of a Lincoln Log.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.320
I remember the day my family
left my childhood home.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.583
- It was heartbreaking.
- Did your dad sell it?

04:39.670 --> 04:43.892
No. Rebel soldiers took it over
and turned it into a brothel.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.633
Well, at least
you could still visit it.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.374
Yes, for 40 Senegalese francs

04:47.461 --> 04:51.465
I can catch gonorrhea
in my old bedroom.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.944
I remember the Fourth of July

04:53.031 --> 04:55.382
my dad lit the drapes on fire
with a Roman candle.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.558
He was shooting off
fireworks inside the house?

04:57.645 --> 04:59.299
Well, that was where my mom
ran for cover.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.084
In his defense,
she did squirt charcoal fluid

05:02.171 --> 05:04.739
at his face while
he was smoking a cigarette.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.393
She tried to light his head
on fire?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.872
No, she just wanted
to scare him.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.874
She had the garden hose
in her other hand.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.314
Oh, speak of the devil.
She's taking the dog out.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.619
Get down, get down,
if she sees me,

05:15.706 --> 05:17.186
she's gonna make me
shovel that walk.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.757
Squeeze one out before
I freeze my keister off.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.673
And remember, it's just poop,
you're not burying King Tut.

Wow, so the captain
wants to spend

05:35.422 --> 05:37.293
the rest of his life
with your mom?

05:37.380 --> 05:41.166
Well,
people marry serial killers.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.126
Seems a little rushed, if you
ask me. What do you think?

05:44.213 --> 05:46.041
I think if someone's crazy
enough to want to marry

05:46.128 --> 05:49.131
your mother,
you hand her over immediately.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.828
- I meant the pants.
- Oh.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.613
Ooh, nice.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.919
You know, I've never seen you
in corduroy before.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.444
It was a fire hazard before.

05:57.531 --> 06:00.360
- Yea or nay?
- Let me see the back.

Ooh, yea.
Coming and going.

I just don't know why he has to
uproot her like that.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.976
She's gonna have to leave
all of her friends behind.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.805
Her only friend is a dog,
and if he could turn a car key

06:10.892 --> 06:13.024
he'd already be in Scottsdale.

'What if she doesn't want to go,
I hate to think'

06:14.765 --> 06:17.028
'she's letting
some guy push her around.'

06:17.115 --> 06:19.291
Mike, the only way somebody's
gonna push your mother around

06:19.379 --> 06:22.512
is if she's strapped to a gurney
wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.473
- You love this, don't you?
- I do.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.692
I think that shirt
works with the pants.

06:28.779 --> 06:29.954
No, I mean you love the fact

06:30.041 --> 06:32.261
that my mom
is moving four states away.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.394
It's actually five. Did you
forget to count Oklahoma?

what I'm going through, do you?

I have a pretty good idea.

Your mom suddenly
has a new man in her life

06:45.883 --> 06:48.582
and he's taking her away
from your childhood home

06:48.669 --> 06:52.150
and all of the memories
associated with that.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.283

so threatened and abandoned.

had the security tag on them?

- He's been by three times.

where he went after that.

he's put me through

and I finally do have a kid

my old bedroom

I ever climbed.

The limb snapped off,
but the tree's still there.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.949
You know, my old house
in Indiana is now a meth lab.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.386
Oh, that's a shame. When did you
and your folks move out?

10:48.473 --> 10:51.868
Oh, my folks still live there.

10:51.955 --> 10:55.567
That's, uh, part of the reason
I'm not a real cop.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.440
Yeah, they're pretty thorough
with the background checks.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.314
Molly?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.408
There you are.
I have been worried sick.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.419
[instrumental music]

11:23.160 --> 11:25.075
I can't believe
you ran off like that.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.512
Why didn't you use the security
guard's phone to call me?

11:27.599 --> 11:30.602
Because he didn't have the name
Molly in his list of contacts.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.694
And star-one on his phone
was some meth head in Indiana.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.696
Well, why didn't you
call your phone?

11:36.783 --> 11:40.047
Because...I didn't think of that
until just now!

11:42.179 --> 11:43.441
Well, I was in a panic.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.922
No idea where you were,
no way to find you.

11:46.009 --> 11:48.577
I must have run into
a dozen stores looking for you.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.797
And I wasn't
in Victoria's Secret, huh?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.450
Quit trying to
change the subject.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.193
By the way, you're over
your $300 credit limit

11:56.280 --> 11:57.673
on your debit card.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.675
I thought you'd want to know!

12:04.724 --> 12:06.508
Look at my little college girl.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.728
She's been hitting the books
all night.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.642
It's either that,
or sleep with my professor.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.428
And I don't want to play
that card until finals week.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.779
She gets those smarts from me.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.870
Thanks for helping
with the bags.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.089
Well, that's why
you should never

12:22.176 --> 12:23.699
buy more than you can carry.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.441
Where are you going?

12:26.528 --> 12:28.269
Going upstairs to change
out of these stupid clothes

12:28.356 --> 12:29.705
so we can go to my mom's house.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.228
Well, you gave
all of your clothes away

12:31.315 --> 12:32.621
and we live in the basement now.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.712
You're on top of the world,
aren't you? Huh?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.758
What a fun night for Molly!

12:38.845 --> 12:41.195
Mike!

12:41.282 --> 12:42.413
Jackass.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.287
What's the matter
with Thumbelina?

12:46.374 --> 12:48.985
We kind of got separated at
the mall, and then he got lost--

12:49.072 --> 12:51.074
- Are those new shoes?
- Cute, right?

12:52.815 --> 12:55.296
How'd you lose him while
he was wearing those pants?

12:55.383 --> 12:58.473
They sound like two guys
sawing a sequoia.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.040
I'm trying to cut him
some slack.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.259
He's upset
his mom's moving to Arizona.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.261
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.741
Don't say anything around Mike.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.569
He hasn't found
the silver lining yet.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.789
And I don't want to jinx it.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.359
It's a beautiful ring, Peggy.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.144
Little gaudy for me

13:17.231 --> 13:19.494
but it belonged to Patty's
deceased mother.

13:19.581 --> 13:22.758
And who am I to crap on the
horrible tastes of a dead woman?

13:25.326 --> 13:27.197
You know, a man
gets to a certain age

13:27.284 --> 13:29.591
and he starts thinking
his best years are behind him.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.985
But I know, with you by my side

13:32.072 --> 13:34.639
I can see the long,
beautiful road ahead.

13:34.726 --> 13:38.556
I-80. It's a wonderful drive.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.689
Hey, why don't I
put on a pot of decaf

13:40.776 --> 13:43.039
and bring out some dessert.
I made your favorite.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.563
- Coconut cream pie?
- Not you. Him.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.305
Ooh, rhubarb cobbler.
Did you use my mother's recipe?

13:48.392 --> 13:50.133
Hey, I'll wear her
tacky jewelry

13:50.220 --> 13:54.616
but I won't have her giving me
cooking lessons from the grave.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.575
- Boy, that woman is a spitfire.
- She is a saint.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.186
Raised me all on her own.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.537
In this very house. Our house.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.669
Come on, Jim. Let's take a walk.

14:07.542 --> 14:11.154
Hmm. It's not you,
it's, it's the rhubarb.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.764
- Oh.
- So what are you thinking?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.244
A spring wedding?

14:18.205 --> 14:20.424
[sighs]

14:20.511 --> 14:22.557
Say goodbye
to your favorite tree, Jim.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.906
When you move to Arizona

14:23.993 --> 14:25.299
you're gonna be whizzing
on cactuses

14:25.386 --> 14:27.431
and that's a whole different
skill set.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.654
Biggs, is it
just my imagination

14:32.741 --> 14:37.137
or do you have your rather
sizeable undies in a twist?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.966
I'm not trying to cause
any trouble, sir.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.619
I'm just not good with change.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.753
Yeah. Well, I understand.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.102
You've been
the most important man

14:46.189 --> 14:48.365
in your mother's life
up until now.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.714
Actually, sir,
that would be the guy

14:49.801 --> 14:52.674
that just got done whizzing
on a tree.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.850
Well, we all take
a backseat to His Majesty.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.202
You know, even though I don't
visit her as much as I should

14:59.289 --> 15:01.422
I-I liked
knowing that she was here.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.380
You know, like the weight room
at the precinct.

15:05.165 --> 15:08.429
What the hell are they
doing out there anyway?

15:08.516 --> 15:10.779
Jim won't pee
when you're staring at him.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.607
He gets that from me.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.392
So, how soon are you kids
moving to Arizona?

15:15.479 --> 15:17.917
I could help you throw
some stuff in boxes tonight.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.353
What are you talking about?

15:19.440 --> 15:23.357
Who the hell said
I'm moving to Arizona?

15:23.444 --> 15:25.620
Uh..

15:25.707 --> 15:28.971
The captain
didn't mention that, huh?

15:29.058 --> 15:30.451
You ever been to Arizona?

15:30.538 --> 15:33.410
It's just a furnace
full of drunk Indians.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.370
Really? That's not what
it says on their license plate.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.244
I hope you two
will be very happy, sir.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.637
Thanks, Biggs.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.988
I must say, every day
I'm with her is a dream.

15:46.075 --> 15:49.078
What's this cockamamie scheme
I hear about you dragging me

15:49.165 --> 15:51.907
to live amongst
the lizards and Comanches?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.953
- I thought she knew.
- Let's get out of here.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.738
Congratulations.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.132
Don't think you can waltz
into my life

15:59.219 --> 16:01.177
and start calling the shots,
Crazy Guggenheim.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.266
I just thought you'd want to
get out of this cold weather.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.920
You're always complaining
about the snow.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.183
I complain about everything,
numb-nuts!

16:07.270 --> 16:09.403
You want to take that
away from me, too?

16:19.282 --> 16:22.155
[instrumental music]

16:34.167 --> 16:36.343
Hey, boy,
what are you doing out here?

16:36.430 --> 16:39.607
Oh, I was driving by, and I saw
that your walk was a little icy

16:39.694 --> 16:41.348
so I thought
I'd shovel it off for you.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.741
Look, if you need five bucks,
just ask.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.570
You know what, mom?
No charge.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.224
Maybe when I'm finished, uh

16:48.311 --> 16:50.574
I'll come in and we can watch
the Blackhawks game.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.011
Sounds great.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.274
I'll make us
a tuna noodle casserole

16:54.361 --> 16:56.928
if someone will ever finish
cleaning the oven!

16:58.669 --> 17:02.151
Angel, you told me to finish
my dusting before I..

17:05.676 --> 17:06.851
Hello, Biggs.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.376
Captain.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.204
What are you doing?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.988
Just pitching in

17:13.075 --> 17:15.904
helping your mother keep up
with this big, wonderful house.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.298
- That we are never leaving.
- That we are never leaving.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.868
- What are you doing?
- Just finishing up the walk.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.480
Right now, neither one of you
are doing squat.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.134
Plenty of time to flap your gums

17:28.221 --> 17:29.309
when you're done
with your chores.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.919
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.228
Yours, I can just cut off.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.186
Theirs,
I've got to remove slowly.

17:42.409 --> 17:45.281
