WEBVTT

00:01.867 --> 00:03.203
(man on TV)
'With the sixth pick..'

00:03.269 --> 00:05.038
Uh, the NFL Draft?

00:05.105 --> 00:06.540
You don't even
care about football.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.141
True, but I do care about

00:08.208 --> 00:10.143
the next crop of
muscle‐bound millionaires

00:10.210 --> 00:11.477
and where they're gonna live.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.416
"LaShawn Wallace to Denver."

00:16.482 --> 00:18.752
Oh, oh, I could live in Denver.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.488
With his contract
you could buy Denver.

00:24.157 --> 00:28.762
What's up, people, other than
my new en vume.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.999
Check it out,
stand in line to feel

00:33.066 --> 00:34.768
the velvet.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.436
Go on,
do it yourself.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.304
Doesn't anybody
read anymore?

00:38.371 --> 00:39.840
Hey.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.608
Hey, what's wrong,
Obie?

00:41.675 --> 00:43.476
You know how I haven't
been able to stomach football

00:43.544 --> 00:48.882
since the Browns left Cleveland
and became the Baltimore Ravens.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.617
Well, at least you can
say Browns now.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.352
You know, I was getting tired
of you calling them

00:52.418 --> 00:55.088
"The team that was formerly
known as a paper bag color."

00:56.289 --> 00:57.423
I mean, what happened
to the sport?

00:57.490 --> 00:59.693
You know, all these teams
movin' around.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.867
You got the Oakland Traitors

01:00.934 --> 01:04.470
the Indianapolis Bolts,
what's next?

01:04.538 --> 01:06.740
The Seattle See‐ya‐hawks?

01:08.208 --> 01:09.909
If you want your
little team back

01:09.976 --> 01:12.045
why don't you just start
a letter writing campaign?

01:12.112 --> 01:14.147
They'll be so stunned to learn
a Browns' fan could write

01:14.214 --> 01:16.382
they just might do somethin'.

01:16.449 --> 01:19.152
Well, I've written
over 291 letters

01:19.219 --> 01:21.221
without nary a response.

01:21.287 --> 01:23.790
And next time your Epilady
breaks down

01:23.857 --> 01:25.191
I ain't fixin' it, fuzzy.

01:26.893 --> 01:28.562
You know, Overton,
there's strength in numbers.

01:28.629 --> 01:31.297
Maybe you should put together
a group of people like you.

01:31.364 --> 01:33.099
You know, Browns' fans.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.134
No life!

01:35.636 --> 01:37.838
Your, um, sarcasm aside

01:37.904 --> 01:39.339
that's a pretty good idea.

01:39.405 --> 01:41.241
Get a room full of Browns fans

01:41.307 --> 01:42.909
man, there ain't nothin'
we can't do.

01:42.976 --> 01:44.144
Uh, yes, there is, this time

01:44.210 --> 01:46.079
there will be no bobbing
for dog biscuits

01:46.146 --> 01:47.080
in the bathtub.

Hey, I thought you had

02:24.591 --> 02:29.429
What, no dress, no jewelry,
no cleave.

02:29.495 --> 02:33.967
Well, according to "How To Catch
That Brother For Keeps"

02:34.034 --> 02:36.503
a woman should not go
out of her way to impress

02:36.570 --> 02:38.705
a man on the first date.

02:38.772 --> 02:40.574
He on the sorry side, huh?

02:42.075 --> 02:43.043
Yep.

02:44.611 --> 02:47.548
But, hey, he's got tickets
to the Fugees concert, right?

02:50.951 --> 02:52.986
Damn, dinggity, damnitty,
damn it!

02:55.255 --> 02:57.858
Hey, I didn't know you could
conjugate the word "Damn."

02:58.992 --> 03:00.634
Shut up, shorty‐by‐nature.

03:03.570 --> 03:05.138
Now, somebody is rippin' off
the schools

03:05.205 --> 03:07.541
and for some reason
my constituents seem to think

03:07.608 --> 03:10.210
that Alderwoman Shaw should get
to the bottom of it.

03:10.276 --> 03:12.112
The nerve of those voters.

03:12.178 --> 03:15.015
Electing you to office
and actually expectin' you

03:15.081 --> 03:16.182
to do somethin'.

03:17.483 --> 03:19.452
Can you dig it, alright?

03:19.520 --> 03:22.689
Now, they‐they just dropped
a whole load of dough down there

03:22.756 --> 03:26.326
but no seems to know
where the shemangees went.

03:26.392 --> 03:27.728
Now, what am I supposed to do

03:27.794 --> 03:30.030
about there not being
enough books

03:30.096 --> 03:32.132
chocolate milk or condoms
for the kiddies?

03:33.534 --> 03:35.802
Tell 'em to share books
and not booty.

03:37.504 --> 03:39.005
Let me get this right.

03:39.072 --> 03:41.174
You sayin' the money
was allocated

03:41.241 --> 03:42.843
but nobody knows
where it went?

03:44.277 --> 03:45.879
Yes.

03:45.946 --> 03:49.149
Ah, I smell an expose
for "Flavor."

03:49.215 --> 03:51.484
And I could help you, too.

03:51.552 --> 03:54.788
Mm, that never
occurred to me.

03:56.022 --> 03:58.324
Okay, I'll need a list
of your contacts..

04:00.901 --> 04:03.103
...a copy of the city's budget..

04:05.572 --> 04:07.508
...and a great photo
for the cover..

04:09.843 --> 04:10.911
[car horn honking]

04:10.977 --> 04:14.014
Well, I bet
that's my date.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.181
[honking continues]

04:17.050 --> 04:20.987
That's a brand‐new Jaguar XJS!

04:22.923 --> 04:25.091
Oh, no, I‐I got to slap on
some make‐up

04:25.158 --> 04:27.093
and p‐put on some real clothes.

04:28.428 --> 04:31.765
[laughs]
She's pretty good.

04:31.832 --> 04:34.668
Only thing is
the Jaguar's driving off

04:34.734 --> 04:37.136
and her date is gettin' out
of a Chevette

04:37.203 --> 04:39.973
with a trash bag
where the window used to be.

04:45.478 --> 04:46.980
What's happening there,
dimples?

04:47.047 --> 04:48.682
Oh, good morning,
may I help you?

04:48.749 --> 04:50.050
Yes, you may, bam!

04:50.116 --> 04:52.418
I'm Tyrone Richardson,
the new writer.

04:52.485 --> 04:53.520
Well, how nice for you.

04:53.587 --> 04:55.388
I'm Synclaire,
the old office manager.

04:55.455 --> 04:56.857
Well, not really
the old office manager

04:56.923 --> 04:57.991
because I'm not that old

04:58.058 --> 04:59.560
and certainly
it's not an old office.

04:59.626 --> 05:02.102
There's brand‐new furniture,
all very nice.. Oh.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.403
Wild guess, wild guess.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.838
You related to the boss?

05:06.206 --> 05:07.808
Are you Ty Richardson?

05:07.874 --> 05:10.677
We met at the National Black
Journalists Convention.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.813
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.281
Who could forget a face
as beautiful as yours?

05:15.348 --> 05:16.917
[both chuckle]

05:16.983 --> 05:20.053
Could you tell Khadijah James
I'm here, please?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.323
Certainly, Khadijah,
there's a Ty Richardson

05:23.389 --> 05:24.658
here to see you.

05:26.893 --> 05:31.197
You know what it is? You went
from beautiful to just fine!

05:32.766 --> 05:35.536
Oh, my gorsch,
it's Ty Richardson!

05:35.602 --> 05:37.871
What's up, homie? You get
the interviews nobody can get.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.041
Nelson Mandela,
Castro, the Artist.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.612
So, what brings you here?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.948
Well, your partners down
at Global Publishing

05:48.014 --> 05:50.851
met by salary demands and
they told me to start today.

05:50.917 --> 05:54.955
So, congratulations,
everybody, here I is!

05:55.822 --> 05:57.090
Really?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.359
Well, did the people at Global
say anything to you

05:59.425 --> 06:01.034
about tellin' my ass?

06:05.639 --> 06:07.373
Jeremy Mills, please.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.542
Oh, there's confusion

06:08.609 --> 06:09.876
and for once
I'm not involved.

06:12.713 --> 06:14.214
Yeah, Jeremy

06:14.280 --> 06:16.049
where do you get off
hirin' my staff?

06:17.217 --> 06:18.484
I know he's good.

06:19.653 --> 06:21.187
Look..

06:21.254 --> 06:23.056
Okay, he's exceptional.

06:24.190 --> 06:25.626
Well..

06:27.327 --> 06:28.595
Okay, well, he's hired

06:28.662 --> 06:30.764
and don't you dare
fight me on this.

06:32.098 --> 06:33.099
Alright, then

06:33.166 --> 06:34.968
let's welcome our new reporter.

06:35.035 --> 06:37.971
Give him a pencil
and clear off the donut table.

06:38.038 --> 06:40.173
Alright, well,
welcome aboard, Ty.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.943
Just don't be thinking about
pushin' up our Khadijah.

06:43.009 --> 06:44.611
We already got
the wedding planned.

06:47.347 --> 06:50.183
Listen, Ty,
regardless to who hired you

06:50.250 --> 06:52.252
this is my magazine, okay?

06:52.318 --> 06:54.487
See this pencil? Mine.

06:54.555 --> 06:57.524
This paper? Mine.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.025
This troll here?

07:01.067 --> 07:02.335
You can have this.

07:05.271 --> 07:07.674
Hey, look, Khadijah,
I'm just here

07:07.741 --> 07:11.578
to add a little bit
of funk to "Flavor." Okay?

07:11.645 --> 07:13.413
Alright, let's get you
an assignment

07:13.479 --> 07:15.415
so, you can get
hell out of here.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.719
This is mine,
this is mine.

07:18.785 --> 07:21.622
I got this one,
I gotta do this one‐‐

07:21.688 --> 07:23.123
Hey, check this out,
check this out.

07:23.189 --> 07:25.125
How 'bout a article
on the misappropriation

07:25.191 --> 07:26.492
of public school funds?

07:26.560 --> 07:29.095
Well, that's my cover story,
I already have a couple of calls

07:29.162 --> 07:30.764
into the city's
purchasing director.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.498
‐ Wallace Doolittle?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

07:32.566 --> 07:34.400
‐ You called him?
‐ Yeah.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.837
That's cute.
That's real cute

07:36.903 --> 07:39.372
You see, you shoulda tracked
him down at his favorite bar

07:39.439 --> 07:41.708
and bought him tequila
all night like I did.

07:41.775 --> 07:44.811
That brother spilled his guts.

07:44.878 --> 07:46.212
Then he staggered
to the bathroom

07:46.279 --> 07:48.448
and he spilled his guts again!

07:50.551 --> 07:53.486
Okay, the story's yours.
Let me just get you my notes.

07:53.554 --> 07:55.288
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
if I take your notes

07:55.355 --> 07:57.057
that means I have to share
the byline.

07:57.123 --> 07:59.159
Tyrone Richardson
flies solo, baby.

07:59.225 --> 08:02.135
Alright, I need that article
by Friday at five.

08:02.202 --> 08:04.404
Oh, that's a no‐can‐do,
I promised Naomi Campbell

08:04.470 --> 08:06.607
a foot massage at five.

08:06.673 --> 08:07.941
I'll have it at four.

08:09.042 --> 08:12.846
Ooh, Naomi Campbell,
ooh, uh..

08:12.913 --> 08:14.815
I could come along
and hangout, huh?

08:14.881 --> 08:16.683
I could bring some peppermint
foot lotion, you know?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.018
Uh, I don't know, kid

08:18.084 --> 08:20.120
I think you should stay here
with your fiance.

08:20.186 --> 08:22.355
‐ Fiance?
‐ Khadijah.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.590
Uh, since you gonna
have my baby

08:23.657 --> 08:27.594
um...I think it's proper
that we get married.

08:27.661 --> 08:28.929
You want some coffee?

08:29.730 --> 08:30.697
[door closes]

08:33.600 --> 08:35.001
Well, sweet pea,
since the meetin'

08:35.068 --> 08:36.870
was supposed to start
a hour ago

08:36.937 --> 08:39.339
I guess nobody really cares
about the Browns anymore.

08:40.774 --> 08:42.576
'Cept Kyle, my best buddy.

08:42.643 --> 08:43.876
I knew you'd make it, man.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.278
Overton, man, I was delayed

08:45.345 --> 08:47.347
and I missed
your little get‐together.

08:47.413 --> 08:49.983
[giggles]
How unfortunate.

08:50.050 --> 08:53.019
Well, actually,
you're the first to arrive.

08:53.086 --> 08:55.355
Oh, how unfortunate.

08:56.222 --> 08:57.490
[knocking on door]

09:00.193 --> 09:02.468
‐ Hey.
‐ Alright. Hey, man.

09:02.536 --> 09:03.704
Oh, dear God

09:03.770 --> 09:07.273
the Avon Lady has
let herself go.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.242
Eclipse, I'm glad
you could make it, dude.

09:09.309 --> 09:10.577
Where the rest of the crew?

09:10.644 --> 09:12.012
Well, Red Rash and the boys
aren't gonna make it

09:12.078 --> 09:14.748
they're watching
"The White Shadow" marathon.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.283
Tsh, some fans
they are, man.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.452
They could've popped
in a tape like I did.

09:21.021 --> 09:22.956
Well, Overton,
The Eclipse is here

09:23.023 --> 09:25.191
and that's as good as having
a couple of Browns' fans, right?

09:25.258 --> 09:26.392
Yeah, homeboy.

09:26.459 --> 09:28.061
I don't care about no Browns.

09:28.128 --> 09:29.462
I just want the Ravens
out of Baltimore

09:29.530 --> 09:31.197
so my Colts can move back.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.867
Well, let's just, um,
kick this off, shall we?

09:35.536 --> 09:37.638
Greetings, Browns' fan

09:37.704 --> 09:40.507
'Colt's fan and...
person who really'

09:40.574 --> 09:43.243
'doesn't want to be here.'

09:43.309 --> 09:45.145
In today's mail
I received a letter

09:45.211 --> 09:47.113
from the Ravens themselves

09:47.180 --> 09:49.916
and I'm opening it now
so that we can all experience

09:49.983 --> 09:52.753
the good news...together.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.591
Hell, I'm all goose‐pimply.
Uh‐hh‐hh.

09:57.658 --> 09:59.626
"Mr. Jones.." Tsk.

09:59.693 --> 10:03.804
"In response to your 291 letters

10:03.870 --> 10:09.610
"be advised that you will be
served with an harassment suit..

10:09.676 --> 10:13.914
"...unless you cease and desist
immediately.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.382
"We strongly suggest
you seek therapy.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.351
[laughing]

10:18.418 --> 10:21.321
Best wishes, the damn Ravens."

10:23.724 --> 10:26.527
Oh, man,
what a day, what a day.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.494
I had lunch with TLC

10:28.562 --> 10:31.031
and I played ball with BBD.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.332
Which reminds me

10:32.398 --> 10:36.469
Sunday I have church
with Run‐D. M. C.

10:36.537 --> 10:40.974
Well, you had a message
from CP, Colin Powell.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.743
He wants to know
if he can bring his four alarm

10:42.809 --> 10:44.745
potato salad
to your picnic.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.881
Well, he can bring it, but
nobody eats it but James Brown.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.950
James love stuff
that makes him go..

10:50.016 --> 10:52.218
<i>Hey!</i>

10:52.285 --> 10:54.888
Ty! Hey, everybody,
Ty's here.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.423
Listen, man, we've been waiting
all morning for you to tell us

10:57.490 --> 11:00.193
how you got that exclusive
interview with Heidi Fleiss.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.736
Okay, okay, okay,
it all started when I called her

11:02.803 --> 11:04.871
and disguised my voice
as Charlie Sheen and said‐‐

11:04.938 --> 11:06.372
Get back to work.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.143
Hey, listen, if anybody
is looking for this reporter

11:10.210 --> 11:12.445
I'mma be out on a dangerous
assignment.

11:12.513 --> 11:15.448
You just make sure they put
mustard on my turkey pastrami.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.619
See, the deli's in
a very rough hood.

11:21.221 --> 11:23.624
What's up with you, man? I mean,
y‐you're partying all night.

11:23.690 --> 11:25.859
You roll up in here
at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

11:25.926 --> 11:27.460
Man, you got a story
due tomorrow.

11:27.528 --> 11:30.063
Come on, baby,
don't sweat it, I got you.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.932
Now, if it help you
sleep at night

11:31.998 --> 11:33.266
here's my notes.

11:38.238 --> 11:40.373
Dry‐cleaning receipt?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.709
Candy wrapper?

11:42.776 --> 11:44.911
Okay, before I was worried,
now I'm scared.

11:44.978 --> 11:47.313
Wait a minute,
you took notes

11:47.380 --> 11:49.583
on the wrapper of a king‐sized
peanut butter cup?

11:49.650 --> 11:50.617
What's wrong with that?

11:50.684 --> 11:52.252
I'm sayin' break a sister

11:52.318 --> 11:53.587
off a peanut butter cup.

11:55.455 --> 11:56.590
So, it turns out

11:56.657 --> 11:58.258
Herman isn't some
broke weirdo

11:58.324 --> 12:00.667
he is actually
quite wealthy.

12:00.734 --> 12:03.236
And I'm actually quite busy.

12:03.303 --> 12:05.171
The Chevette, see,
that's just a car

12:05.238 --> 12:08.341
that he uses to drive
to his Rolls Royce.

12:09.743 --> 12:11.778
So, you definitely goin'
to see him again?

12:11.845 --> 12:13.980
Tsh, well, now my book says

12:14.047 --> 12:16.683
that I shouldn't, you know,
call him for another week or so

12:16.750 --> 12:19.152
but it doesn't say nothin'
about drivin' by his house.

12:21.187 --> 12:24.157
Max, that means you ain't
in my apartment.

12:24.224 --> 12:25.191
See ya.

12:26.993 --> 12:28.529
Alright, girl, hey

12:28.595 --> 12:30.430
I know you be workin'
all night on our story

12:30.496 --> 12:32.432
so I brought you
a little din‐din.

12:35.235 --> 12:36.603
It's half gone.

12:36.670 --> 12:37.738
If traffic were any heavier

12:37.804 --> 12:39.239
you'd be suckin' crust.

12:40.541 --> 12:42.643
Khadijah, can you please
forgive me?

12:44.110 --> 12:46.513
I've been swayed
by false prophets.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.414
Ty and I were chillin'
at McGillicuddy's, right?

12:48.481 --> 12:51.785
Now, he clocked this dude for
eating peanuts out of his bowl.

12:51.852 --> 12:53.353
That kid has got a cover story

12:53.419 --> 12:55.355
and he's out buck wildin'
at a bar?

12:55.421 --> 12:59.092
You gave my story
to some peanut freak?

12:59.159 --> 13:02.569
What the hell
were you thinking, man?

13:03.704 --> 13:05.639
Max, just chill,
we have 18 hours

13:05.706 --> 13:06.740
before we got to press.

13:06.807 --> 13:08.241
Ivan, get down to that bar

13:08.308 --> 13:10.043
and drag that fool back here.

13:10.110 --> 13:12.045
Oh, you know, I'd do
anything for you, Khadijah

13:12.112 --> 13:13.046
but Ty in jail.

13:13.113 --> 13:14.280
‐ What?
‐ Yeah, well, see..

13:14.347 --> 13:16.049
The cop that he punched
turned out to be a cop

13:16.116 --> 13:18.051
'cause he was a, he was
a cop when he punched him.

13:19.553 --> 13:21.454
Well, what's gonna happen
to my cover story?

13:21.522 --> 13:22.789
More importantly

13:22.856 --> 13:25.626
what going to happen
to Alderwoman Shaw?

13:25.692 --> 13:28.494
Damn, dinggity,
damnitty, damn it!

13:33.700 --> 13:35.468
Mm‐hmm. Uh‐huh.
Alright, thanks, pigeon.

13:35.536 --> 13:36.803
I owe you one.

13:38.404 --> 13:41.174
Well, your boy Tyrone
is definitely in lockdown

13:41.241 --> 13:42.543
awaiting arrangement,
and that means

13:42.609 --> 13:43.810
he'll miss the deadline

13:43.877 --> 13:45.879
and Maxine Shaw

13:45.946 --> 13:47.380
the Maverick

13:47.447 --> 13:48.849
will ride no more.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.184
Whoop that, I'll write
the story my damn self.

13:51.251 --> 13:52.586
Good, good, good.

13:52.653 --> 13:54.588
Alright, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

13:54.655 --> 13:56.056
What do we got?

13:56.122 --> 13:57.958
Well, I‐I haven't been
on this thing for three days

13:58.024 --> 14:00.393
I mean, I got a quote
from an anonymous source

14:00.460 --> 14:02.903
and I got a possible lead from
the city's purchasing director.

14:02.969 --> 14:05.471
‐ But..
‐ You got squat.

14:05.539 --> 14:07.073
Actually,
I'll kill for squat.

14:08.308 --> 14:10.143
Alright, okay, okay

14:10.210 --> 14:12.278
it's time for Maxine Shaw

14:12.345 --> 14:14.380
defender of the people

14:14.447 --> 14:16.049
to spring into action.

14:17.584 --> 14:19.152
What, are you supposed
to be, a superhero?

14:19.219 --> 14:20.486
To some.

14:20.554 --> 14:23.223
My cunning legal mind
will devise a scheme

14:23.289 --> 14:25.458
to turn over the rock
of bureaucracy

14:25.526 --> 14:27.528
exposing the worms underneath.

14:27.594 --> 14:28.829
Let's go.

14:31.264 --> 14:32.933
This is your plan, Max

14:32.999 --> 14:34.868
sneaking into city hall
at night?

14:34.935 --> 14:36.937
What's your brilliant plan?
Nothin'.

14:37.003 --> 14:38.038
Shoot.

14:38.104 --> 14:40.040
[instrumental music]

14:42.943 --> 14:44.277
[whispering]
Janet Kirby.

14:44.344 --> 14:45.478
Now, see my sources told me

14:45.546 --> 14:47.548
she vacationed in
the south of France last year.

14:47.614 --> 14:49.049
Oh, God. Yes.

14:51.585 --> 14:52.953
Shoot, it's locked.

14:53.019 --> 14:53.954
Oh, don't worry.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.321
The city issued me
a master key

14:55.388 --> 14:56.823
that gets me in everywhere.

14:59.392 --> 15:00.901
‐ Alright.
‐ We're in.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.068
We're in.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.672
Now, if I were
a scandalous document

15:05.739 --> 15:07.908
where would I hide?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.711
I wonder which one of these
desks is Janet Kirby's?

15:12.746 --> 15:14.515
Ah! Bingo!

15:16.382 --> 15:18.218
Let's see, maybe there's
somethin' on this computer.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.353
You can't get to her files
with a password.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.822
Well, maybe we can
figure it out.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.526
[keyboard keys clacking]

15:25.592 --> 15:27.694
Ooh, what an ugly poodle.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.531
Poodle.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.701
Try "Butt ugly poodle."

15:36.169 --> 15:37.303
Come on, Max.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.741
‐ Dog.
‐ Yeah, brilliant, Khadijah.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.543
The woman's embezzling
thousands of dollars

15:42.609 --> 15:44.144
and she'd be that stupid.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.311
[computer beeps]

15:47.247 --> 15:49.215
Like I said,
brilliant, brilliant!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.217
‐ Alright.
‐ Yeah.

15:53.654 --> 15:57.023
Look at this, looks like
a second set of books.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.926
‐ PS‐751, $10,000.
‐ Yes, yes.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.134
‐ PS‐804..
‐ 804..

16:01.201 --> 16:02.268
(both)
$10,000.

16:02.335 --> 16:04.538
PS‐804, that's in my district.

16:04.605 --> 16:06.039
We were supposed
to get that ten grand.

16:06.106 --> 16:08.308
All we got were
a box of used erasers

16:08.374 --> 16:10.310
and a map
of the old Soviet Union.

16:11.912 --> 16:14.515
Well, let's just copy this file
and get the hell out of here.

16:16.182 --> 16:17.784
[keys jangling]

16:17.851 --> 16:19.119
‐ Oh, hide.
‐ Hide.

16:21.588 --> 16:24.525
[instrumental music]

16:25.191 --> 16:26.860
Alright, freeze!

16:32.633 --> 16:34.434
Oh..

16:34.500 --> 16:36.870
<i>Oh!</i>

16:36.937 --> 16:38.905
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

16:38.972 --> 16:43.043
We have been up and through
this mug for over two minutes

16:43.109 --> 16:45.045
Officer Coleman.

16:45.111 --> 16:46.446
What?

16:46.513 --> 16:48.281
I am Shaw..

16:50.416 --> 16:51.685
...and this is James.

16:53.153 --> 16:54.721
And we are from
Security Security.

16:54.788 --> 16:55.956
Security Security.

16:56.022 --> 16:58.291
And every arbitrary period

16:58.358 --> 16:59.760
we do a surprise check.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.001
Surprise!

17:01.067 --> 17:02.402
I didn't hear anything about

17:02.468 --> 17:04.037
any surprise <i>check.</i>

17:04.104 --> 17:07.007
Hence, the word "Surprise."

17:07.073 --> 17:10.010
Is that liquor I smell
on your breath?

17:10.076 --> 17:13.046
Well, just a little
birthday celebration, you know.

17:13.113 --> 17:14.548
We passed around a 40.

17:15.949 --> 17:18.819
Oh, so you're all <i>inebriated?</i>

17:18.885 --> 17:19.953
Well, I want the whole shift

17:20.020 --> 17:21.454
in the break room
in ten minutes.

17:21.521 --> 17:24.290
Oh, man,
this is my third strike.

17:25.491 --> 17:26.627
Did she stutter?

17:26.693 --> 17:27.794
Move it!

17:34.835 --> 17:38.238
This is the tray from
my very first Browns foot long.

17:40.173 --> 17:41.374
Ah.

17:41.441 --> 17:44.210
Well, at least you were
able to let the dog go.

17:46.580 --> 17:49.215
Fresh as the day..

17:49.282 --> 17:51.417
That there is fresh as the day
I bought it.

17:52.919 --> 17:54.154
Okay, Overton,
you know what?

17:54.220 --> 17:56.189
This Browns thing
is turning into an obsession

17:56.256 --> 17:58.859
and I think
it's time to move on.

17:58.925 --> 18:01.868
Aw, baby girl,
I'm not obsessed or nothin'.

18:01.935 --> 18:04.638
I just can't stop
talkin' 'bout it.

18:05.939 --> 18:08.008
Look, baby, I know it's hard
for you to understand

18:08.074 --> 18:09.810
but Cleveland Municipal Stadium

18:09.876 --> 18:12.646
was like the Mecca
of my childhood.

18:12.713 --> 18:16.883
Everything good and holy
happened there.

18:16.950 --> 18:20.687
Even the drunken fistfights with
the Steeler fans were magical.

18:22.155 --> 18:24.324
But, do I have to listen
to your whining?

18:26.326 --> 18:28.328
Oh, I'm whinin'?

18:28.394 --> 18:32.165
Who took three days off when
they cancelled "Full House?"

18:33.166 --> 18:34.400
Hey, man

18:34.467 --> 18:36.369
I grew up
with those twins

18:36.436 --> 18:38.038
but I moved on.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.542
Mm, Khadijah

18:41.608 --> 18:42.743
I got some of
your favorite coffee

18:42.809 --> 18:43.944
in my favorite mug

18:44.010 --> 18:46.513
for my favorite journalist.

18:46.580 --> 18:49.950
Too bad your favorite journalist
doesn't drink coffee.

18:50.016 --> 18:51.785
Well, look who made bail.

18:51.852 --> 18:54.588
Sorry for cuttin' it so close
but Todd Bridges was on "Cops."

18:56.422 --> 18:57.758
Here's my story on disk.

18:57.824 --> 18:59.392
You can send it right to layout.

19:00.827 --> 19:03.837
You know, before I fire you,
I just have one question.

19:03.904 --> 19:05.271
Who the hell do you think
you are?

19:05.338 --> 19:06.907
Didn't you get
a copy of my bio?

19:06.973 --> 19:09.342
Look, work was bein' done here
while you were in jail

19:09.409 --> 19:10.877
braidin' some guy's head.

19:12.078 --> 19:13.413
Okay, look, Khadijah

19:13.479 --> 19:17.117
that cop that I pretended
to hit, we go way back.

19:17.183 --> 19:18.652
You see, I got locked up

19:18.719 --> 19:20.854
so, that I can talk to Kirby's
partner in crime

19:20.921 --> 19:22.656
who was locked up
for shopliftin'.

19:22.723 --> 19:24.024
Well, how'd you get
anything out of him?

19:24.090 --> 19:25.692
I convinced him that Kirby

19:25.759 --> 19:27.093
was cuttin' him
out of the profits.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.664
Pfft, my man opened up like
my grandfather's pants

19:30.731 --> 19:32.666
during Thanksgiving dinner.

19:34.668 --> 19:35.736
Well, good.

19:35.802 --> 19:36.803
Add a couple of your quotes

19:36.870 --> 19:38.038
and it'll make our article

19:38.104 --> 19:39.673
that much better.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.008
Wait a minute, what do you mean
"Our article?"

19:42.075 --> 19:44.711
I told you, Ty Richardson
don't share no byline.

19:44.778 --> 19:47.413
Fine, I'll take your name off
altogether.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.816
Do we always have
to go at it like this?

19:49.883 --> 19:51.317
Not if you give in.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.220
Alright.

19:54.287 --> 19:55.722
Why don't we get started

19:55.789 --> 19:58.091
on our story?

19:58.158 --> 19:59.425
I decide

19:59.492 --> 20:01.835
when we get started.

20:01.902 --> 20:03.269
[exhales]

20:03.336 --> 20:04.605
Okay, let's start.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.776
Overton, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.146
(Overton)
'Oh!'

20:14.480 --> 20:17.217
What the hell, Jim Brown,
how you doin'?

20:17.283 --> 20:19.720
‐ Oh, better than ever, baby.
‐ Alright.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.288
I tracked Mr. Brown down
at a collectible show.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.858
When I told him your story,
he had to come.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.492
And I know what you're
going through, man.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.162
I was a consultant
for the Browns

20:29.229 --> 20:30.797
but I had to walk away
from those Ravens, man.

20:30.864 --> 20:32.398
It just wouldn't be the same.

20:32.465 --> 20:36.436
Yeah, I guess you understand why
the little sports fan inside me

20:36.503 --> 20:38.639
is coughin' up blood now.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.674
Come on, my man,
it's just a game.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.443
I quit in my prime
pursuin' another dream

20:43.510 --> 20:46.112
and that dream came true.

20:46.179 --> 20:49.149
Have you seen
"The Dirty Dozen," man?

20:49.215 --> 20:51.351
Are you kiddin'?
I watch it every New Year's Eve

20:51.417 --> 20:53.486
with tears in my eyes.

20:53.554 --> 20:55.088
What Mr. Brown is saying

20:55.155 --> 20:56.957
is that I'm your new dream.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.125
I'm your dirty dozen, Obie.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.037
Before I go I have something
I want you to have.

21:04.104 --> 21:06.840
Oh, man, a boxset
of all your movies

21:06.907 --> 21:10.010
including "Slaughter,
The Director's Cut."

21:10.076 --> 21:11.712
How can I thank you, man?

21:11.778 --> 21:15.081
Well, just give the lady
all the love that she deserves.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.750
‐ Okay?
‐ Thank you, Jim.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.985
‐ 'Alright.'
‐ Oh, alright.

21:20.253 --> 21:21.888
Hey, Overton

21:21.955 --> 21:23.724
from now on I want you to watch

21:23.790 --> 21:27.293
"Original Gangstas"
on New Year's Eve.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.062
OG.

21:29.129 --> 21:31.565
Alright, but who wants to wait
till New Year's Eve

21:31.632 --> 21:33.567
uh, let's go watch this now.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.401
Come on, let's go then.

21:39.139 --> 21:41.074

22:09.610 --> 22:11.377
