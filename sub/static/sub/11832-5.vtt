10:11.170 --> 10:16.110
a little unfaithful
to Susan.

10:16.110 --> 10:20.110
That afternoon,
she caught me.

10:23.130 --> 10:25.060
- Do you think maybe
to retaliate

10:25.060 --> 10:28.170
she could've gone home
from the bar with some guy?

10:28.170 --> 10:31.030
Is that possible?

10:31.030 --> 10:34.120
- Ms. Frutt, I have spent
the last two months

10:34.120 --> 10:36.040
desperately trying
to convince myself

10:36.040 --> 10:38.090
that that isn't possible.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.100
REBECCA:
You ought to go down there

10:50.100 --> 10:51.130
and peak in that courtroom.

10:51.130 --> 10:52.180
- Rebecca.
- It's obscene.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.200
You want
the Anti-Defamation League

10:53.200 --> 10:55.040
picketing our office?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.070
- It's a trial.
Qualified immunity.

10:56.070 --> 10:57.180
- Well, that can excuse it.

10:57.180 --> 11:00.000
- This office is getting
way too hostile for me.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.200
- Why don't you just go and--
- Come on, Bobby.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.140
We're late.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.110
- She was the manager,

11:14.110 --> 11:17.130
and her leadership ability
was suffering.

11:17.130 --> 11:19.090
- Because she was Iranian?

11:19.090 --> 11:21.190
- I certainly don't agree
with the bigotry,

11:21.190 --> 11:23.100
but I have
a dry cleaners to run,

11:23.100 --> 11:27.220
and well,
it wasn't running so well.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.220
- What about calling a meeting,

11:29.220 --> 11:33.040
telling your employees
that bigotry won't be accepted?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.060
- It wasn't so much
what people were doing

11:35.060 --> 11:37.010
so much as
what they were feeling,

11:37.010 --> 11:41.150
and I mean,
I was powerless to control that.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.100
- And the feeling
was anti-Iranian?

11:44.100 --> 11:45.170
- Anti-Iranian.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.080
Anti-Arab.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.140
Basically Middle East.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.160
- And you agree
that this feeling

11:49.160 --> 11:51.040
was a form of prejudice?

11:51.040 --> 11:53.020
- Oh, of course.
- But you tolerated it?

11:53.020 --> 11:56.000
- Well--
- You fired her, Mr. Martini.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.040
We could say
you ratified the bigotry.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.150
- Well, you could,
but I had 18 workers

12:00.150 --> 12:01.210
come up and threaten to quit.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.110
My choice, basically,

12:03.110 --> 12:05.090
was either discharging
your client

12:05.090 --> 12:07.100
or facing Chapter 11.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.040
- I see.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.000
And if Ms. Bader were black

12:12.000 --> 12:13.190
and your workers
threatened to quit

12:13.190 --> 12:16.180
because they didn't want to work
with an African-American,

12:16.180 --> 12:18.030
would you have fired her?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.190
- Probably not.
- What's the difference?

12:20.190 --> 12:23.200
- Possibly none,
but complaining

12:23.200 --> 12:26.060
about the color
of a person's skin is--

12:26.060 --> 12:27.210
that's racism,

12:27.210 --> 12:30.150
which lies in hatred
and ignorance.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.050
I mean, here--here,
I feel there was

12:33.050 --> 12:34.210
some patriotism involved,

12:34.210 --> 12:39.100
and I guess it wasn't
quite as repulsive to me.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.010
- He willfully
withheld evidence.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.010
- I did no such thing.
- You have a duty to turn over--

12:43.010 --> 12:44.230
- Don't start with all of your--
- You just can't--

12:44.230 --> 12:47.210
- I don't listen
when two people talk.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.070
- They have an absolute duty

12:49.070 --> 12:51.160
to turn over
all exculpatory evidence.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.060
- Material evidence.
This--

12:53.060 --> 12:55.070
- Let him finish, please.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.160
- The boyfriend of the victim
provided the prosecution

12:57.160 --> 13:00.090
with a reason that the victim
may have gone to a bar

13:00.090 --> 13:03.110
and may have been predisposed
to a one night stand.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.130
He did not turn
that information over to us.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.020
- Why not?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.050
- We didn't consider it

13:08.050 --> 13:10.000
either material
or relevant.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.090
- What's the information?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.010
- She had caught him
that very day

13:13.010 --> 13:14.000
with another woman.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.060
- Mr. Tisbury,
the break you catch here

13:19.060 --> 13:21.150
is that this came out
before trial.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.130
- Your Honor, that statement--

13:23.130 --> 13:26.130
- As of this second,
I don't trust you.

13:26.130 --> 13:28.090
You're going into trial
with a judge

13:28.090 --> 13:30.050
who doesn't trust you.

13:30.050 --> 13:32.020
So if you're going
to make any more mistakes

13:32.020 --> 13:33.090
from this point on,

13:33.090 --> 13:36.110
I suggest you err
to their side.

13:36.110 --> 13:40.030
- There was no willful attempt
to withhold evidence.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.080
- Then how unfortunate
that I don't believe you.

13:45.130 --> 13:47.110
- My position
is that Judge Hiller erred

13:47.110 --> 13:49.140
when she denied our right
to assert self-defense.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.040
- I see no such denial
in the record.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.010
- If you read the transcript,
she threatened us

13:53.010 --> 13:54.070
with a bad jury instruction

13:54.070 --> 13:55.140
if we went the route
of self-defense.

13:55.140 --> 13:56.160
- It wasn't a ruling.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.030
- It was tantamount to a ruling.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.220
It had the effect
of shutting us down.

13:59.220 --> 14:01.210
- Are you now, suggesting
that it was self-defense,

14:01.210 --> 14:04.120
'cause that gives me
a problem, counsel.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.070
- Which is?

14:06.070 --> 14:08.180
- At trial, you argued that
the gun went off involuntarily.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.100
Your client testified to that,

14:10.100 --> 14:12.170
but now you're
saying self-defense.

14:12.170 --> 14:15.020
Did your client
commit perjury on the stand?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.000
- First of all,
this hearing

14:17.000 --> 14:19.150
is about Judge Hiller's ruling,
not my client's testimony.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.060
- So, we should ignore
the truth--

14:21.060 --> 14:24.080
- Secondly, defendants
can assert alternative defenses.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.190
We could've argued A,
he shot him self-defense,

14:26.190 --> 14:28.190
and B,
it went off involuntarily.

14:28.190 --> 14:29.190
That's permissible.

14:29.190 --> 14:31.090
What this hearing is about

14:31.090 --> 14:34.140
is Judge Hiller denying us
one of those defenses.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.170
- So basically you're saying

14:35.170 --> 14:37.110
had Judge Hiller
not cut you off,

14:37.110 --> 14:39.030
self-defense would've
been your theory.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.080
- Exactly.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.070
Are we all up to speed, now?

14:45.080 --> 14:48.080
- Do you really mean to be
snide with us, Ms. Dole?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.230
- Actually, yes.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.150
You wouldn't be
asking these questions

14:51.150 --> 14:53.080
if you'd read my brief.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.040
I'm discouraged
to realize you haven't.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.070
I hope you at least
reprimand your clerks.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.120
- Let's just
address your issue then.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.090
- She cut off self-defense

15:02.090 --> 15:05.150
because the victim wasn't
posing an imminent threat.

15:05.150 --> 15:07.040
That was wrong.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.030
The threat to my client
was both real and ongoing.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.150
Mr. Pearson
was in fear of his life

15:11.150 --> 15:12.220
at the time
he pulled the trigger.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.090
- The victim had no gun.

15:14.090 --> 15:17.180
Uh, my clerk
did highlight that part.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.040
- In defining "imminent,"
if you look at the cases,

15:20.040 --> 15:23.020
the courts basically
come down to these questions.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.230
Was there any alternative?

15:24.230 --> 15:26.140
Could he have used less force?

15:26.140 --> 15:27.190
Could he have escaped?

15:27.190 --> 15:29.050
Could he have retreated?

15:29.050 --> 15:30.190
Could he have just
held them at gunpoint

15:30.190 --> 15:32.020
until the police arrived?

15:32.020 --> 15:33.130
- In this situation,
the answer seems

15:33.130 --> 15:34.220
to be yes
to all of those options.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.230
- But the reality
for all of those options

15:36.230 --> 15:38.120
is that man would be back.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.130
- Perhaps,
but as Judge Hiller noted,

15:40.130 --> 15:42.070
we weren't at that point when--

15:42.070 --> 15:45.130
- And to require him to wait
till that point is unreasonable.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.090
- Are you asking us
to rewrite the law?

15:47.090 --> 15:50.210
- No, some states have
recognized a kidnap exception.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.140
Basically,
if a man kidnaps somebody

15:52.140 --> 15:54.130
and tells the victim
he's gonna kill them in a month,

15:54.130 --> 15:56.080
that victim doesn't have
to wait a whole month

15:56.080 --> 15:58.060
until he's allowed
to use deadly force.

15:58.060 --> 16:01.040
- True, but Mr. Pearson
wasn't kidnapped.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.190
- In effect, he was.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.070
He was basically held captive.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.070
He'd gone to the police.

16:05.070 --> 16:06.160
They couldn't help.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.230
He got a restraining order
from the court.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.000
It didn't help.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.190
The time was coming.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.040
And we're saying
Anderson Pearson

16:13.040 --> 16:15.190
should've waited
until the exact moment?

16:15.190 --> 16:17.050
Suppose Raymond Breyer

16:17.050 --> 16:18.190
came at night
while they were sleeping.

16:18.190 --> 16:20.120
- There is no evidence
of any direct threat

16:20.120 --> 16:21.130
to kill Mr. Pearson.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.170
- It was certainly implied.

16:23.170 --> 16:25.040
Yeah, I could argue
it was direct

16:25.040 --> 16:26.110
with a cat-and-mouse exchange,

16:26.110 --> 16:28.070
and whether
it was direct or not,

16:28.070 --> 16:31.200
Anderson Pearson had
a reasonable belief that it was.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.180
- Well, it still seems
like a reach to imply that--

16:33.180 --> 16:36.140
- But we're entitled
to that reach

16:36.140 --> 16:38.130
before a jury.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.140
Judge Hiller shut it down.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.200
It's error.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.200
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>♪</i> ♪

16:52.200 --> 16:55.040
- "TIME" magazine on "Newsweek."

16:55.040 --> 16:58.080
- They went easier
on Ricky Jewell.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.190
Oh, listen to this.

16:59.190 --> 17:01.140

17:07.000 --> 17:08.089
I was one of them.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.060

about it.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.230
I've spoken to
every one of his friends.

17:15.230 --> 17:18.079
- And?

17:18.079 --> 17:21.119
- They all used three words

17:27.020 --> 17:28.220
- He's in trouble.

have agreed to see me tomorrow.

17:32.070 --> 17:36.020
If they can't point us
some place,

17:36.020 --> 17:40.000
yeah, he's in trouble.

LINDSAY: Tomorrow.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.190
It went well; I seemed
to have their attention.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.080
- Great, let's get some dinner.
- No.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.050
I'm gonna go back to the office,
get on Westlaw.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.010
You know, there's a new case
ruling like every ten minutes.

17:50.010 --> 17:51.110
- Lindsay, take a break.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.190
- I'll take a break
when it's over.

17:52.190 --> 17:53.190
- Is it ever gonna be over?

17:53.190 --> 17:54.220
- I'll see you at home.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.120
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.120
- She's been up
till 3:00 in the morning

18:02.120 --> 18:03.160
every night since the trial.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.050
It's like some quest.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.080
- Helen, she's close to him.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.110
You know, she might win.

18:08.110 --> 18:11.150
- Oh, come on,
overturn Hiller?

18:11.150 --> 18:14.230
- You should've seen her.

18:14.230 --> 18:17.030
- You went to Mr. Martini
and complained?

18:17.030 --> 18:18.170
- I did.

18:18.170 --> 18:20.120
- Threatened to quit, even,
if she worked there?

18:20.120 --> 18:22.030
- Yes.

18:22.030 --> 18:23.100
- Because you didn't want
to work side-by-side

18:23.100 --> 18:25.210
with a person
of Iranian descent?

18:25.210 --> 18:28.110
- I don't have a problem
with her as a person, but--

18:28.110 --> 18:32.040
- But what?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.020
- I'm not over
the hostage thing.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.140
I admit it.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.000
- Mr. Harper,
that was almost 20 years ago.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.140
- I really don't care.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.190
It all comes back.

18:39.190 --> 18:41.150
I see burning American flags.

18:41.150 --> 18:42.230
I see Khomeini.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.100
I get all pent up with anger.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.130
- But this woman
wasn't in government.

18:45.130 --> 18:46.230
How--

18:46.230 --> 18:48.230
- The Iranian people
cheered that government,

18:48.230 --> 18:50.230
and they never apologized.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.100
And our government,

18:52.100 --> 18:54.210
we just forgave them
because they got oil.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.230
Well, I can't forgive them.

18:56.230 --> 19:00.100
- This woman was nine years old
during the hostage crisis.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.010
- Well, she's old enough now
to make a judgment.

19:03.010 --> 19:04.150
And when she looks me in the eye

19:04.150 --> 19:06.140
and says, "I'm proud
to be an Iranian,"

19:06.140 --> 19:09.040
I don't want to work
side-by-side with her.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.060
- Did she ever engage
in any political

19:11.060 --> 19:12.220
or religious discourse at work?

19:12.220 --> 19:14.180
- No,
and I'm sure

19:14.180 --> 19:17.200
she personally has never
blown up in embassy,

19:17.200 --> 19:20.100
but imagine,
they're carrying signs

19:20.100 --> 19:22.020
that say,
"Death to the U.S."

19:22.020 --> 19:24.220
and here she is,
in our country, suing for a job.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.090
Ask me, the turban must've
been wrapped too tight.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.220
- That last remark
was unnecessary.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.170
- You asked me to testify
and tell my feelings.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.060
- Just the same,
you basically stood up

19:36.060 --> 19:37.080
and declared yourself a bigot.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.230
- I am prejudiced on this,

19:38.230 --> 19:42.200
but I think this is
a bigotry I'm entitled to.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.210
- You're not the person
I thought I knew, Ron.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.100
- Sally,
I know I'm blaming you

19:47.100 --> 19:49.100
for something that has
nothing to do with you.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.030
That doesn't mean I'm above it.

19:51.030 --> 19:53.160
- All right, you're represented
by counsel, Ms. Bader.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.030
It's not appropriate
for us to have communication.

19:56.030 --> 20:00.010
- Yes, we wouldn't want
to be inappropriate, would we?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.070
- Excuse me one second.

20:05.090 --> 20:08.100
Ms. Bader, listen.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.000
I hope you don't
take it personal, things I say.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.030
I have to put on a defense.

20:13.030 --> 20:15.130
- You're saying I should be
ashamed of my descent,

20:15.130 --> 20:17.020
Mr. Berluti.

20:17.020 --> 20:19.200
It's difficult
not to take it personally.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.090
- I'm the lawyer.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.200
I got to--

20:23.200 --> 20:25.040
- You're a little too good.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.130
- Can I at least
make you a cup of coffee?

20:37.130 --> 20:39.050
- No, no, really I'm fine.
- Really?

20:39.050 --> 20:42.230
I feel like I should
at least--no?

20:42.230 --> 20:44.160
- All lawyers work this hard?

20:44.160 --> 20:47.180
- Hmm, big case.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.200
Call me.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.020
- I will.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.230
- Bye.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.140
- I'll see you.

21:01.150 --> 21:03.020
- Morning.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.180
- You slept with him
on a second date?

21:04.180 --> 21:07.070
- I didn't really
<i>sleep</i> sleep with him.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.080
We fell asleep watching TV,

21:09.080 --> 21:11.080
which wouldn't have happened,
by the way,

21:11.080 --> 21:12.190
if I didn't have
to bring him in there

21:12.190 --> 21:15.150
to escape your command post.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.210
What is all this?

21:16.210 --> 21:18.100
Oral arguments are over.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.070
- This is on sentencing,
should we lose the appeal.

21:21.070 --> 21:24.150
- Mm, part of me
hopes you do lose.

21:26.180 --> 21:29.100
I'm a little afraid
if you win, Lindsay.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.120
A new trial--

21:31.120 --> 21:33.140
can you survive going through
all of this again?

21:33.140 --> 21:35.130
- The trial was easy.

21:35.130 --> 21:38.030
Losing it was hard.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.120
- I'm a little
concerned about you.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.010
- I'm fine.

21:44.010 --> 21:45.200
- Withdrawal?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.190
- What that woman said to me,

21:47.190 --> 21:49.210
I'm having
a hard time shaking it.

21:49.210 --> 21:51.180
- You're about to start
closing arguments.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.020
- I know.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.150
I'm just not sure it's in me.

21:54.150 --> 21:57.090
I don't want
to let my cousin down, but--

21:57.090 --> 22:00.000
- Jimmy, if you came to me
with this case in the beginning,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.100
I would have stopped you
from taking it.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.220
It's offensive.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.120
It puts a bad light on you
and the firm,

22:05.120 --> 22:08.110
but there's no way
you can bail at closings.

22:08.110 --> 22:11.210
I mean,
it's not even a question.

22:11.210 --> 22:14.100
- Yeah, I guess.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.130
- And Jimmy,

22:21.130 --> 22:23.170
don't phone it in.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.130
- The police discouraged us
from talking to you.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.070
- As I told your dad,
I'm convinced

22:31.070 --> 22:32.070
they got the wrong guy.

22:32.070 --> 22:33.190
And if they do,

22:33.190 --> 22:35.120
that means that this thing
was either

22:35.120 --> 22:36.220
a mission
to frame George Vogelman,

22:36.220 --> 22:38.200
or somebody
was after your sister.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.230
- And as we told the police,
we don't know

22:40.230 --> 22:42.190
of any such person
who would want to harm her.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.170
- Her boyfriend, Jay,
did you ever

22:44.170 --> 22:47.170
see any predisposition
with him and your sister?

22:47.170 --> 22:49.200
- Jay?
- I'm grasping, Steve.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.020
- Jay's sweet kid.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.200
- Did he ever show a temper?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.010
What if he had
followed your sister,

22:55.010 --> 22:56.070
found her with George Vogelman--

22:56.070 --> 22:59.120
- Jay couldn't have done this.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.080
- Did your sister--

23:02.080 --> 23:04.140
is it possible
that your sister

23:04.140 --> 23:06.170
could have kept
some part of her life secret?

23:06.170 --> 23:10.150
- Mr. Young, I feel I know
my daughter pretty good.

23:10.150 --> 23:13.090
Truth is I can't believe
in a million years

23:13.090 --> 23:15.190
that she'd go to some motel

23:15.190 --> 23:17.110
with a guy she met in a bar,

23:17.110 --> 23:18.190
which leads me to think

23:18.190 --> 23:20.080
that your guy
had to have done it.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.030
- But, Mr. Robin,

23:22.030 --> 23:24.150
you couldn't believe she would
even go to a bar alone,

23:24.150 --> 23:26.150
so, it's possible that--

23:26.150 --> 23:29.030
Steve, help me out.

23:29.030 --> 23:31.040
Is there some other side to her?

23:31.040 --> 23:35.010
- If there was,
I never saw it.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.170
The only--

23:37.170 --> 23:40.080
- What?

23:40.080 --> 23:41.220
The only what?

23:41.220 --> 23:45.080
- She did spend
a lot of time on the Internet

23:45.080 --> 23:47.110
talking at people
she didn't know.

23:47.110 --> 23:50.010
- Would you say that in court?

23:50.010 --> 23:53.200
- I don't know.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.090
I guess.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.020
- After careful review,

24:16.020 --> 24:18.180
we agree with
Ms. Dole's position

24:18.180 --> 24:21.110
that self-defense
should have been available

24:21.110 --> 24:23.150
to the defendant at trial.

24:23.150 --> 24:26.010
Whether the danger
posed to Mr. Pearson

24:26.010 --> 24:27.200
was eminent enough
to justify

24:27.200 --> 24:31.050
the use of excessive force,
it's a question of fact,

24:31.050 --> 24:33.220
which should've been
offered to the jury.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.170
We, therefore, rule
that Judge Hiller's position

24:36.170 --> 24:38.190
was an error.

24:38.190 --> 24:42.100
However, it is not evident
on the record

24:42.100 --> 24:45.130
that Judge Hiller
actually ruled in this matter,

24:45.130 --> 24:48.020
thereby prohibiting
self-defense,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.150
and if defense counsel's
assertion is true

24:50.150 --> 24:54.050
that her warning was,
in effect, a ruling,

24:54.050 --> 24:57.210
then the proper procedure
was interlocutory appeal,

24:57.210 --> 25:00.140
which was waived
by preceding the trial.

25:00.140 --> 25:02.150
The conviction
of Anderson Pearson,

25:02.150 --> 25:05.000
therefore, stands.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.010
We're adjourned.

25:25.110 --> 25:28.200
- It's easy to hate Iranians,
isn't it?

25:28.200 --> 25:30.030
And Arabs?

25:30.030 --> 25:33.200
They blow up
airplanes, buildings.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.000
When that bomb went off
in Oklahoma City,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.120
we all had the same
in knee-jerk reaction,

25:38.120 --> 25:42.100
probably some
Middle East terrorist.

25:42.100 --> 25:46.070
Let's admit it;
we don't like these people.

25:46.070 --> 25:48.090
And I understand the sentiment.

25:48.090 --> 25:50.060
Many of us share
Mr. Harper's frustration

25:50.060 --> 25:51.160
with the hostage crisis.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.230
That's an old but deep wound.

25:53.230 --> 25:56.040
But I take exception
to his message

25:56.040 --> 25:58.180
that it's good old
American patriotism

25:58.180 --> 26:02.180
to discriminate against anyone
from the Middle East.

26:02.180 --> 26:06.000
That's not the country I know.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.120
America stands for tolerance.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.130
The United States
rebelled against oppression,

26:10.130 --> 26:13.220
against prejudice.

26:13.220 --> 26:15.140
Or do we?

26:15.140 --> 26:17.040
Mr. Harper's statement,

26:17.040 --> 26:19.000
"Hey, she makes me angry
'cause of Khomeini,"

26:19.000 --> 26:20.170
that's like saying,

26:20.170 --> 26:23.180
"Hey, the Japanese stir up
these Pearl Harbor memories.

26:23.180 --> 26:26.010
Let's get rid of them."

26:26.010 --> 26:28.040
We did that here once,
remember?

26:28.040 --> 26:30.030
Rounded up
all the Japanese,

26:30.030 --> 26:31.150
threw them in internment camps.

26:31.150 --> 26:33.050
Didn't matter
they were U.S. citizens.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.170
Didn't matter
they were innocent.

26:34.170 --> 26:38.030
They were of Japanese descent.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.020
And this country,

26:40.020 --> 26:43.080
we're ashamed of that
little piece of history.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.120
Well, here we go again,

26:45.120 --> 26:48.170
because today's Cold War

26:48.170 --> 26:52.130
is against terrorism,

26:52.130 --> 26:55.040
and it's just so easy
to hate the towel heads,

26:55.040 --> 26:56.220
isn't it?

27:01.210 --> 27:03.060
- She may have hooked up
with some psycho

27:03.060 --> 27:04.060
from the Internet.

27:04.060 --> 27:05.100
Maybe he was stalking her?

27:05.100 --> 27:06.210
- Even so.
- What, even so?

27:06.210 --> 27:08.060
Can your guys
start running that down?

27:08.060 --> 27:09.110
- Ellenor, again,
off the record.

27:09.110 --> 27:10.180
- Sure.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.180
- This case
is pretty hot copy.

27:12.180 --> 27:15.040
The police want to mark
"Solved" on the file.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.180
The DA's office
wants to mark "Conviction."

27:17.180 --> 27:19.040
If anything turns up indicating

27:19.040 --> 27:20.140
it could have been
somebody else,

27:20.140 --> 27:23.010
forget about
getting a conviction.

27:23.010 --> 27:25.000
Your guy was last seen with her.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.020
He had her head.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.150
If George Vogelman didn't do it,

27:27.150 --> 27:29.160
he certainly represents
reasonable doubt

27:29.160 --> 27:30.200
for whoever did.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.000
- What are you saying?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.030
They'd rather get a conviction

27:33.030 --> 27:34.030
than catch the right guy?

27:34.030 --> 27:35.060
- Not really,

27:35.060 --> 27:36.160
but their need for a conviction

27:36.160 --> 27:38.190
helps them to think
they have the right guy.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.230
- Oh, that's great.

27:40.230 --> 27:42.140
What's the punch line, Helen?

27:42.140 --> 27:45.010
- They're not gonna
reopen the investigation.

27:48.110 --> 27:51.060
- When this trial started,
I got to admit,

27:51.060 --> 27:52.150
I was one of those people

27:52.150 --> 27:54.230
who sometimes
have those thoughts.

27:54.230 --> 27:56.140
See some terrorist attack
on the news,

27:56.140 --> 27:57.230
I'd say,
"To hell with all of them."

27:57.230 --> 28:00.030
A lot of people
in this country

28:00.030 --> 28:02.000
think the best thing
about Iranians

28:02.000 --> 28:04.140
is that they kill Iraqis.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.230
But in Ms. Bader,

28:05.230 --> 28:10.110
you saw a woman of dignity,
integrity,

28:10.110 --> 28:13.050
and,
not that this is relevant,

28:13.050 --> 28:17.000
but having somebody like her
as the mother of my children,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.050
I should be so lucky.

28:19.050 --> 28:22.030
But this isn't about her.

28:22.030 --> 28:25.030
It's about the actions
of Peter Martini.

28:25.030 --> 28:28.020
Was his firing
of her reasonable?

28:28.020 --> 28:30.030
Under normal times, no,

28:30.030 --> 28:34.020
but with what's
going on today, yes.

28:34.020 --> 28:36.120
True, he could have said,
"Prejudice is prejudice,"

28:36.120 --> 28:38.010
and not fired her,

28:38.010 --> 28:39.180
in which case,
his staff might have quit,

28:39.180 --> 28:41.170
and he'd be out of business.

28:41.170 --> 28:44.070
And as for
the prejudice itself,

28:44.070 --> 28:48.130
sorry, but it's not the same
as bigotry against blacks.

28:48.130 --> 28:51.160
This is different.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.100
There's a war going on here.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.010
Like Ms. Wharton said,
and the president said,

28:56.010 --> 29:00.050
terrorism is today's war.

29:00.050 --> 29:02.050
Somebody who didn't
look like a killer

29:02.050 --> 29:04.120
put a bomb
in the World Trade Center.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.010
We can expect more such attacks
since we bombed Sudan.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.170
And I don't mean to suggest
for one second

29:10.170 --> 29:14.210
that Ms. Bader is connected
in any way to anything bad,

29:14.210 --> 29:18.050
but it is people's right
to be afraid.

29:18.050 --> 29:21.220
Our government is telling us
to be afraid.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.090

to ask yourselves is this:

29:43.090 --> 29:47.100
if an Iranian or Arab
came to you looking for work,

29:47.100 --> 29:48.170
would you hire them,

29:48.170 --> 29:51.170
knowing it would
upset personnel?

29:51.170 --> 29:55.020
If you can answer that question
with an easy, "Yes,"

29:55.020 --> 29:57.060
fine for the plaintiff.

29:57.060 --> 30:00.110
But if your answer is,
"Probably not,"

30:00.110 --> 30:03.190
all I ask is
that you go back there

30:03.190 --> 30:05.220
and be honest with yourselves.
