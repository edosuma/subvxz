05:14.439 --> 05:16.695
So on the heels of the Cold War,

05:16.775 --> 05:18.989
Barry Goldwater, a businessman

05:19.069 --> 05:22.117
and a five-term United States Senator
from Arizona,

05:22.197 --> 05:25.662
decided to run for the election
of the presidency.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.233
He had a substantial impact and...

05:29.579 --> 05:31.616
Are you excited for summer?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.006
Yeah.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.716
Are you gonna see your friends?

05:37.796 --> 05:40.218
- No.
- Why not?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.846
- Don't have any.
- So, you'll be with your brother?

05:42.926 --> 05:44.556
Yeah.

05:44.636 --> 05:49.478
Then, Milo, I think we've seen each other
enough that we trust each other, right?

05:49.558 --> 05:50.687
Yeah.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.440
You know you can answer honestly with me.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.485
- Yeah.
- There are no consequences.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.852
You understand you don't get in trouble?

06:00.277 --> 06:02.240
Yeah.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.357
Have you been hurting any animals?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.078
No.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.195
Not at all? Not even thinking?

06:11.288 --> 06:13.835
Maybe thinking, but... no.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.837
So you're thinking about that?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.673
Tell me about that.
Tell me about the thoughts.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.801
It's nothing. Just thoughts now and then.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.295
But I don't do it, not any more.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.204
- Where you goin'?
- Get him!

07:10.805 --> 07:13.013
- Come here.
- Fuck him up, D.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.804
- Hold him.
- Hit him!

07:16.519 --> 07:17.816
Stop it, retard.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.488
That's nasty. You've got some on me, bro.

07:23.668 --> 07:27.441
- That was fun.
- That's right. You'd better run, little bitch.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.533
...afterwards, insurance
companies may spend millions

08:08.613 --> 08:12.162
figuring out ways to pay you
less than you deserve.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.280
Their profits depend on you...

08:16.621 --> 08:20.503
Hey.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.245
Did you buy milk?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.551
No.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.053
We need milk.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.639
Did you pay the internet bill?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.756
- No.
- I need the internet.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.812
Then pay it. Get milk too.

What the fuck are you doin'?

08:58.621 --> 09:02.080
Oh. Nothin'.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.053
- Will they eat all that?
- Yeah.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.430
Well, they've scooped all the grass
out of the stomach

09:12.510 --> 09:17.005
- and they eat the whole stomach lining...
- It's licking it at the moment.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.689
Milo!

09:20.769 --> 09:22.607
What?

09:22.687 --> 09:25.100
I'm gonna disappear for a few hours.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.486
Okay.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.813
Hey, freak. Don't ignore me, motherfucker.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.914
Yeah, it's time to go home, freak.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.042
Yo, lock up your dogs. Woof, woof!

10:27.710 --> 10:29.716
Ah, little weird-ass motherfucker!

10:29.796 --> 10:31.676
All right, let's be out of here.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.826
The elevator's broke.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.522
Oh.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.575
This way.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.009
Hello?

11:30.023 --> 11:33.516
Could, um... could you help me with my bags?

11:53.119 --> 11:54.926
Thanks so much.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.089
- What floor?
- Nine.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.429
- What's your name?
- Milo.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.341
Holy shit. Thanks again.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.027
Goodnight.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.679
Let's go. Up you get.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.546
Get off your ass. Get in there.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.722
I think she loves me. Mm!

13:40.653 --> 13:42.700
I thought I had a small one.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.584
- Does that hurt?
- What the fuck?

14:41.089 --> 14:43.797
Sorry. I saw you here earlier.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.269
Yeah.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.966
They're dicks.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.940
You want a drink?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.814
Sure.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.038
I guess I asked a stupid question.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.458
- What?
- Does it hurt?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.495
Sex?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.380
Not really.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.247
No.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.095
Oh, and...

15:26.175 --> 15:28.212
You know what I mean, it's like...

15:29.804 --> 15:31.796
It's like a release.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.221
And, well, it's not like
I'm making my arm any uglier.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.021
- What's that?
- Psoriasis.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.980
It's not catchy or anything, don't worry.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.494
- Can you catch it from blood?
- What?

15:49.574 --> 15:52.080
Like, can I get it from your blood?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.197
No, no, no. It's not like that.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.538
Can I see?

16:00.543 --> 16:02.500
Can I see?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.143
Oh, my God, gross.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.636
- Sorry.
- Hey, um... I mean...

16:17.935 --> 16:20.769
I mean kind of sweet... gross.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.399
Wow, you're really into, erm...

17:01.479 --> 17:03.359
Vampires.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.153
I was gonna say scary movies.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.224
No. Vampires.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.453
Like Twilight?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.289
Yeah. No.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.833
I don't know. I haven't watched them.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.950
Oh, you should. They're really good.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.382
Do you want to watch a video?

17:49.485 --> 17:53.326
The average American consumes
120 pounds of beef per year.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.079
In a typical month, slaughterhouses
across the country

17:57.159 --> 18:02.325
will kill nearly three million cows
and 385,000 lambs.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.385
Each individual on the assembly line
has his own specialty.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.262
During this whole process, I began...

18:13.342 --> 18:15.223
Erm... I have to go. I...

18:15.303 --> 18:18.421
- I'm late for this thing, so...
- Yeah.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.984
Sorry.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.228
It's fine. I just... I just have to go.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.278
What the fuck are you doing?

20:00.491 --> 20:01.829
Nothing.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.001
- No! No!
- Let her go!

20:08.404 --> 20:09.865
Do it!

20:15.381 --> 20:18.874
Now look at her! Look at her!

22:16.252 --> 22:17.413
Hello?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.631
Hello?

23:39.877 --> 23:41.459
Milo!

23:43.380 --> 23:46.136
Hey, Milo, wait up.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.138
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.558
- Uh... Where are you going?
- Home.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.476
- Walking?
- Yeah.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.593
- Cool. Can I walk with you?
- Sure.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.402
Do people ever tell you you don't talk a lot?

24:01.482 --> 24:04.488
- No.
- Really?

24:04.568 --> 24:06.525
No one ever speaks to me.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.506
Sorry for showing you that video.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.969
Don't worry about it. Um...
My friend Leo loves sick videos like that.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.847
He used to show me
that kind of stuff all the time.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.308
I mean, it's no big deal. I just had to go.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.254
No, it's... it's fine.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.695
Do you ever think about suicide?

24:44.775 --> 24:47.267
Not really. I can't kill myself.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.772
- You can't kill yourself?
- Yeah. I can't.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.866
Like, it's your religion?

24:55.911 --> 24:59.245
I mean, yeah, sure. It's just the rules.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.504
It's just the way it is.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.465
My mom killed herself.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.926
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.749
That's fine.
It's just something that happened.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.636
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.700
Do you want to go to the movies
with me tomorrow?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.214
Yeah, okay.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.001
Okay, cool.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.720
What time?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.713
Noon. I'll stop by your place.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.835
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.758
Do you wanna...

27:45.247 --> 27:47.127
Did you like it?

27:47.207 --> 27:50.881
Uh... I thought it was interesting.
I liked the music.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.092
But I still think Twilight is better.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.887
You should see it or read it.
At least the first one.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.014
I prefer Let the Right One In.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.559
- What's that?
- Maybe I'll show it to you some night.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.426
Okay.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.566
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't, like,

28:09.646 --> 28:11.735
immediately asked me what I'm doing here.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.695
Do you live with your parents?

28:13.775 --> 28:17.950
No, my grandfather. He's pretty awful.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.079
I mean, I guess the best thing about him
is that... that he's slow,

28:22.159 --> 28:25.749
- so he can't catch me that often.
- Catch you?

28:25.829 --> 28:28.585
Yeah. He's a violent motherfucker.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.547
Put a cigarette out on me last week.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.007
I almost went to the cops.

28:34.087 --> 28:37.719
Wow. I guess you don't
like your grandpa much?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.513
Yeah, it's fucked up...

28:39.593 --> 28:42.506
- Where's your dad?
- Dead. They're both dead.

28:43.597 --> 28:47.229
- Oh. Mine, too.
- Really?

28:47.309 --> 28:51.191
Yeah. My dad died when I was like, eight,

28:51.271 --> 28:53.604
but he got sick when I was like, six.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.198
I mean, it was...
It took a long time for him to die,

28:58.278 --> 29:01.521
but when he did die, it was like,
a release, you know?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.649
He was yelling and screaming all the time.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.742
- Jesus.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

29:43.115 --> 29:47.164
It's just, I bet the vampires in Twilight
aren't very realistic.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.333
There's no such thing as a realistic vampire.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.836
There is. I mean, more realistic.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.784
I mean, vampires don't twinkle.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.635
Okay. So... So, what are vampires like?

29:59.715 --> 30:04.097
Well, I think it starts
with drinking blood, like...

30:04.177 --> 30:06.141
Like, you have a need to.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.895
It's like... It's like when you have a cut
on your finger when you're a little kid,

30:09.975 --> 30:13.023
and you're sucking it,
but eventually that's not good enough,

30:13.103 --> 30:16.068
so you... so you switch to animals
and stuff like that,

30:16.148 --> 30:18.570
and then, you know, people, and...

30:18.650 --> 30:22.199
And you change a lot
after the first person you kill,

30:22.279 --> 30:27.195
and you change a lot more after...
after one after another.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.959
But I think when you first start off
being a vampire, all the...

30:32.039 --> 30:34.586
all the stuff you see in the movies
doesn't really matter.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.339
Like, you can go out in the sun
and you can eat garlic,

30:37.419 --> 30:40.467
and I don't even think
the church stuff is even true.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.511
Like, maybe to religious vampires, you know?

30:42.591 --> 30:44.972
And I don't think you get bit.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.261
I think it's like a...
it's like a disease you get.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.131
Wow. Which book is this?

30:52.017 --> 30:55.399
It's not a book, it's just how I think it is.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.985
Vampires existed before books did.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.648
Well, the sun kills them in True Blood.

31:01.818 --> 31:05.075
I did not watch that show. It did not look
like it was gonna be realistic at all.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.952
Oh, my God, you should. It's so good.

31:07.032 --> 31:12.124
In this one... erm, in this one episode,
the vampire that makes Eric

31:12.204 --> 31:16.378
starts feeling, like, really bad
about what he does, so he kills himself.

31:16.458 --> 31:20.048
He like, goes up on a roof,
I think, and then...

31:20.128 --> 31:22.962
and then the sun comes up and just kills him.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.432
I mean, it could be true, but I don't think
a vampire can kill himself.

31:28.512 --> 31:32.144
- Why not?
- I don't know. It's like a...

31:32.224 --> 31:34.557
it's like an animal instinct.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.066
So, they get to live forever?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.684
Maybe. I don't know yet.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.333
Do you go to their graves?

31:54.413 --> 31:56.543
No.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.422
I don't go to my mom's grave.
I wouldn't even know where to go.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.341
What do you mean?

32:02.421 --> 32:06.011
My brother handled everything,
and he doesn't like to talk about it.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.263
You didn't go to the funeral?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.300
No. He said I shouldn't.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.348
Well, then why not ask him?

32:16.309 --> 32:19.191
I don't think that's a good idea. He...

32:19.271 --> 32:22.309
He's weird about it.
He doesn't want to talk about her.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.271
That's so fucked up.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.995
Would you go if you knew where she was?

32:32.075 --> 32:34.623
I guess.

32:34.703 --> 32:38.037
I'm gonna find her. I mean, do you mind?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.999
I guess not.

32:43.795 --> 32:48.005
I'll go with you to yours and then
you can come with me to mine. Deal?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.722
Okay.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.543
Cool.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.685
Yo, freak.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.863
No, no. That's not good enough, freak.
Come over here.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.526
- Just keep walking.
- It's best if we go.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.120
What's up? Who's your girlfriend?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.663
My name's Sophie.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.957
Hey, why are you slumming
over in the ghetto, Sophie?

33:17.037 --> 33:19.042
Haven't you seen her?
She's living around here.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.877
Yo, that ass? No fucking way, my nigga.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.074
You all right, white bitch?

33:24.127 --> 33:26.341
I'm sorry. I don't mean no offence.
I'm just playing.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.136
- So why are you living here, white bitch?
- I live with my grandfather.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.847
Is he that mean old white motherfucker
up on the ninth floor?

33:33.762 --> 33:34.766
Can we go?

33:34.846 --> 33:37.930
Of course you can go.
I ain't your fucking daddy.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.981
Tell your brother I said hi, freak.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.358
- Come on, man.
- Jungle fever fucker.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.304
Come on, man.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.869
They seemed nice.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.566
They're in the K.
Some of them have killed people.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.614
That was sarcasm.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.747
I had fun tonight. I'm sorry about the...

34:06.002 --> 34:08.091
Goodnight.

34:08.670 --> 34:09.993
Yeah.

34:17.679 --> 34:20.520
Milo, wake up.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.882
Wake up!

34:27.315 --> 34:29.112
What?

34:29.192 --> 34:31.935
There's some white girl
waitin' outside for you.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.733
I found her.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.519
So, what's your favourite vampire movie?

35:09.065 --> 35:12.489
I guess the most realistic.
Like, I like Martin a lot.

35:12.569 --> 35:15.992
It's a '70s one and it's... it's good.
It's... it's realistic.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.538
And Near Dark is really good.
It's pretty cool and realistic.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.332
And the one I was telling you about,
Let the Right One In.

35:22.412 --> 35:25.418
I'm not sure how realistic it is.
I mean, like, she can climb on walls,

35:25.498 --> 35:29.005
and I think maybe
they're just really good climbers.

35:29.085 --> 35:33.705
And Shadow of the Vampire is...
It's good. It's pretty cool and realistic.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.921
Do you miss her?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.101
I guess I do.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.423
It was about the making of Nosferatu.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.185
I miss them.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.414
I forgot to bring flowers.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.458
What does it matter
whether you brought flowers or not?

36:05.538 --> 36:07.450
She's not gonna know.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.299
- You wanna talk?
- Not really.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.038
Yo, it's that white girl again.
She's at the door.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.082
Tell her I'm not home.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.553
Really?

37:00.468 --> 37:02.380
Yeah.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.117
- I'll ask him.
- Yeah?

37:21.197 --> 37:23.286
Yeah, I'll ask him now, now, now.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.372
Hey. Hey, bro. Little brother.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.916
Hey, kid.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.626
Hey, what's up, man?

37:29.706 --> 37:33.505
Yeah, uh, we were just wondering if
you knew where we could buy some C?

37:33.585 --> 37:36.883
Yeah, please, or even some molly?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.135
They don't sell it.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.804
Uh... We're just wondering, uh,

37:40.884 --> 37:43.515
you know, if you could help us out,
if you knew someone?

37:43.595 --> 37:47.805
We're visiting from out of town
and we were hoping to party tonight.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.065
- Uh...
- Yeah, I'll help you.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.316
- Cool.
- Come on.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.934
Yeah, awesome. All right. I'll be right back.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.772
Hey, wait up.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.526
Hey.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.633
Oh, shit.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.772
Come on.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.043
Hello?

39:45.341 --> 39:47.424
Hello?

39:50.346 --> 39:53.305
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This is kinda fucked up.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.596
Hey, who's this?

40:02.358 --> 40:04.072
Hey, what's up?

40:04.152 --> 40:05.984
You guys must be them, right?

40:07.322 --> 40:10.787
I'm, uh... I'm looking for some C,
or some molly if you've got it.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.121
Wait. Hold up, what?

40:12.201 --> 40:15.291
Uh... C. Cocaine? Or molly.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.669
Oh, so you think everybody
that live up in here is a drug dealer?

40:17.749 --> 40:20.630
No, no, dude. Uh... This kid sent me here.
I didn't think anything.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.507
Why the fuck are you asking for drugs, then?

40:22.587 --> 40:25.677
- If you don't think that?
- Whoa, whoa, okay. Erm...

40:25.757 --> 40:29.222
- Look, I'm sorry, uh... I don't...
- You don't think you're fucking racist?

40:29.302 --> 40:31.099
Whoa, I'm not racist, okay?

40:31.179 --> 40:33.476
Oh, that's exactly what we fucking need.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.895
Fuck, are you a cop?

40:35.975 --> 40:38.898
Okay, this is just a misunderstanding,
I think. Yeah.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.985
He said, "This is a misunderstanding."

40:42.065 --> 40:45.738
Okay, I'm just gonna go now.
You guys are on the door.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.949
Now shut the fuck up.

40:48.029 --> 40:51.327
Little G, Little G.
What shall we do with this dude, huh?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.288
- Let's fuck him up.
- Hey, you hear that?

40:53.368 --> 40:55.623
- Dudes, come on. Look.
- Get him! Go ahead, get him!

40:55.703 --> 40:57.208
- Whoa!
- Shit!

40:57.288 --> 41:00.253
Whoa. What the fuck is wrong with you,
hitting a little kid, huh?

41:00.333 --> 41:03.339
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Get that fucker.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.137
Hitting little kids!

41:09.217 --> 41:11.180
What the fuck do you think this is, huh?

41:11.260 --> 41:13.850
Come up here talking about drugs,
then you go and swing on Little G.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.603
Hey, man, stop crying. Come over here.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.925
You wanna hang with us?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.692
- Shoot this bitch.
- What?

41:22.772 --> 41:24.349
Chill.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.391
- No!
- Shut up!

41:28.444 --> 41:30.731
Are you gonna do it or not?

41:33.074 --> 41:36.372
Wait. What are you doing?
Wait. Please, please.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.665
Oh, shit, wait!

41:37.745 --> 41:40.293
- What the fuck did you do?
- I didn't know he'd pull the trigger.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.794
- Come on, man!
- I had the safety on!

41:41.874 --> 41:44.082
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

41:46.295 --> 41:49.584
- Shit.
- Come on. Let's be out. Come on.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.798
Hey! Hey, you, tell me where Mike is!

42:38.431 --> 42:39.592
Stop! Hey!

42:55.281 --> 42:58.454
...told us to respond.
Do you want our unit to respond?

43:03.372 --> 43:04.794
We pass my road here.

43:04.874 --> 43:07.422
- Hold on just a minute.
- Ten-four.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.149
Oh, yeah. Right here looks good, right?

43:12.465 --> 43:15.680
The 7-2 is in backlog.
I got a 78 car over here.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.922
Er, we're going into the 7-2.

43:24.393 --> 43:27.942
- Defending a snitch?
- Thanks, Milo. Stay safe.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.479
Seriously.

43:35.738 --> 43:40.038
...you tell me, "Ah, I'm buying a new car."

43:40.118 --> 43:41.529
Welcome home.

43:43.246 --> 43:46.502
Where have you been last night?
This place has been crazy.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.129
Yeah, I bet.

43:48.209 --> 43:51.382
We were on TV.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.675
We were?

43:53.755 --> 43:55.247
Our building.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.921
Someone killed a white boy in the basement.

44:00.263 --> 44:01.893
No shit?

44:01.973 --> 44:05.842
Yeah. It's been crazy.
It's been on all the news channels.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.559
Cool.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.423
Why are you avoiding me?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.884
I'm not avoiding you.

44:34.964 --> 44:37.081
- Liar.
- I'm not a liar.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.132
Well, liar, I got you this.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.010
- It's Twilight.
- I see that.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.737
Promise me you'll read it.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.809
I promise.

46:35.209 --> 46:38.498
Milo! What are you doing in here?

46:40.548 --> 46:41.914
Come on, get out.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.565
Are you gonna tell me what the fuck is going
on? I heard you talked to the police.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.317
I didn't talk to them. They took me in.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.653
Why did they give you a ride home,
if you ain't talked to them?

46:58.733 --> 47:01.989
They said that if I didn't help them,
that they'd make it seem like I snitched.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.701
Hey, they'll kill you
if they even think you talked to them.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.037
- I didn't tell them anything.
- All right.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.234
You know it don't matter what I think.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.368
You saw it?

47:17.960 --> 47:20.327
- Yeah.
- Shit.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.627
Did they see you see it?

47:26.093 --> 47:27.755
No.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.921
I don't know.

47:34.810 --> 47:38.693
Milo, I can't protect you from them,
you know that, right?

47:38.773 --> 47:40.560
Lewis, stop.

47:41.567 --> 47:45.591
Okay. Okay.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.082
Lewis!

47:53.162 --> 47:55.918
And don't trust your cops neither, all right?

47:55.998 --> 47:58.087
They'll frame you for that shit
just cos they can.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.124
Okay, I get it.

48:00.961 --> 48:03.123
Listen to your older brother.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.876
All right. I understand.

48:07.468 --> 48:09.175
All right.

48:21.190 --> 48:23.227
So this is what you do? You sit up here?

48:24.485 --> 48:26.949
Uh, I study.

48:27.029 --> 48:29.066
That's cool.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.082
Do you believe in God?

48:35.162 --> 48:37.074
No. Do you?

48:38.207 --> 48:41.041
I guess... Yeah.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.453
I had a feeling that you didn't.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.428
I mean like... I think we're all special.

48:47.508 --> 48:50.890
I believe in that. I... I guess it's magical,

48:50.970 --> 48:53.100
but I don't think
anyone intended anything in it.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.354
I think when you die, you're just...
you're just gone.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.939
Don't say that. It's so fucking creepy.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.011
It's true. I think.

49:02.690 --> 49:05.854
Okay. Okay, moving on. Erm...

49:08.696 --> 49:11.660
What would you do with a million dollars?

49:11.740 --> 49:14.080
What if I told you I had one million dollars?

49:14.160 --> 49:16.957
- Then I'd steal it.
- You would?

49:17.037 --> 49:18.793
No.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.295
But I'd ask to borrow some.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.867
What would you do with it?

49:25.546 --> 49:28.334
Get out of here. You know, move out.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.793
- Where would you go?
- Anywhere.

49:34.388 --> 49:37.978
But I, erm... I have a cousin in Alabama.

49:38.058 --> 49:42.052
She'd let me stay there. I could pitch in.
I'd probably go there.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.726
Cool.

49:48.110 --> 49:50.477
Okay, so what would you do
with a million dollars?

49:51.405 --> 49:53.237
I've got plans.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.038
That's it?

49:56.118 --> 49:58.235
Yeah. I've got plans.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.544
I need any help you can give me.

50:01.624 --> 50:05.163
I need three dollars
to have a place to sleep.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.086
Thanks.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.010
You're welcome.

51:42.349 --> 51:44.480
Asher!

51:44.560 --> 51:45.596
Bye.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.160
Yo, Milo.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.211
Been talking to 5-0?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.813
No.

52:09.293 --> 52:11.090
That's not what we heard.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.509
You heard wrong. I don't do that.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.678
That kid screamed like a little bitch, right?

52:15.758 --> 52:18.138
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.926
You don't think
he screamed like a little bitch?

52:22.056 --> 52:27.176
It's a'ight, but Malik said
he saw you there. Right, Malik?

52:29.021 --> 52:31.318
I don't know what you're talking about.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.612
Don't act fucking smart, okay?

52:33.692 --> 52:35.729
I'm not.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.529
Can I go?

52:46.413 --> 52:47.876
This ain't over.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.268
Do you want to do it again?

53:13.014 --> 53:14.451
Stop!

53:17.027 --> 53:20.191
...defrosting or preheating
that giant oven...

53:21.990 --> 53:24.997
...better, healthier and easier...

53:25.077 --> 53:26.999
Um, so, I'll see you tomorrow, then?

53:27.079 --> 53:28.741
Yeah.

53:31.166 --> 53:34.298
Bye.

53:34.678 --> 53:37.259
Aah, I see you, bro.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.637
Lewis.

53:39.717 --> 53:43.434
What? That was nice.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.138
...oven is a new way to cook.
It's energy efficient...

53:56.275 --> 53:58.280
Lewis?

53:58.360 --> 53:59.865
What?

53:59.945 --> 54:01.909
What day is it?

54:01.989 --> 54:04.036
Friday.

54:04.116 --> 54:06.288
No, the date?

54:06.368 --> 54:08.280
The 14th.

54:47.201 --> 54:50.457
Getting money for injured people
is a rare skill.

54:50.537 --> 54:54.086
Insurance companies often refuse
to pay what is fair.

54:54.166 --> 54:59.299
The lawyer you pick must be able
to make them pay, one way or another.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.510
- I'm Lowell "The Hammer" Stanley.
- Hey.

55:01.590 --> 55:05.097
Hey. What's up?

55:05.177 --> 55:08.517
Nothin'. Can I watch TV with you?

55:08.597 --> 55:10.310
Oh, good, good, good.

55:10.390 --> 55:13.772
Come on! Make it work!

55:17.815 --> 55:21.739
The neighbours heard me screaming
and threatened to call the cops,

55:21.819 --> 55:24.232
so he let me go.

55:25.781 --> 55:28.287
Are you hurt?

55:28.367 --> 55:32.040
No, I don't think I need
to see the doctor or anything.

55:33.747 --> 55:36.239
I just really don't wanna go back there.

55:39.086 --> 55:40.716
Is she okay?

55:40.796 --> 55:42.628
Yeah.

55:47.469 --> 55:49.552
Can I stay here?

55:54.142 --> 55:56.099
Sure.

55:58.564 --> 56:00.396
The Chapstick.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.969
Where's the Chapstick?

56:14.580 --> 56:17.027
Where's the Chapstick?

56:21.211 --> 56:23.508
Where's the Chapstick?

56:28.093 --> 56:30.015
Where's the Chapstick?

56:30.095 --> 56:32.132
# The Chapstick, Chapstick

56:33.015 --> 56:36.054
# The Chapstick, where's the Chapstick? #

56:40.898 --> 56:42.935
Where's the Chapstick?

57:40.499 --> 57:44.163
It's energy efficient. It saves time.

58:07.609 --> 58:09.851
Don't you think you should get your stuff?

58:11.113 --> 58:14.494
You mean, like, that I've been
in the same outfit for, like, a week?

58:14.574 --> 58:16.538
And borrowing my clothes.

58:16.618 --> 58:20.282
I mean, it's fine.
It's just, you have to eventually, right?

58:21.915 --> 58:23.656
Yeah.

58:41.685 --> 58:44.928
You... you can stay here
as long as you need to.

58:46.732 --> 58:50.100
Okay. Thanks.

59:11.423 --> 59:13.679
Are you sure you don't mind me not coming?

59:13.759 --> 59:17.548
It's fine. I'm used to spending time
by myself anyways.

59:18.513 --> 59:21.972
Okay. Thanks.

59:24.686 --> 59:26.358
Um, and then...

59:26.438 --> 59:28.475
Oh, we'll get your stuff.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.478
I think I've convinced Lewis to come.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.117
Okay, let's see.

59:35.197 --> 59:37.280
He'll do it. See you soon.

59:56.384 --> 59:59.141
...pain in the tuchas,
particularly when you think,

59:59.221 --> 01:00:00.851
"Why can't I qualify for credit?"

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:03.895
Well, the first place you gotta come
is Major World, because at...

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:07.024
Hi.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.651
- Hey.
- Um... Sorry.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.320
I was, um... I was wondering if you had,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.616
um, a stamp, um, and a... an envelope?

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.107
Um...

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.874
No.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.163
- No?
- Um... I don't know.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.840
Um... okay. Okay, then.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.843
So you really like him?

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.678
Yeah, I do.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.680
We can help you sort out what really happened

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.682
and get you the compensation you deserve.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.100
Call 800-79...

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.602
What's the problem?

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.854
This is a legitimate cheque, okay?

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:49.678
There's nothing wrong with this cheque.
It's perfectly viable.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:02:00.006
Hi, uh, I'd like to cash this cheque
and pay these two bills with it.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.698
And can I get a money order?

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:01.706
She didn't say anything. She just left.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.341
Hi. Uh...

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.590
I know...

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:01.809
I know you saw that stuff,
but if we could meet, then...

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.479
if we could meet, then I could explain.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:17.324
723497 is not available...

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.041
I don't want to hear it...

01:05:59.566 --> 01:06:02.837
- ...fucking money!
- Cheap motherfucker!

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.757
- Give me the fucking money!
- Why?

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.842
Why don't you fucking go...

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.640
- Goddamn you!
- Fucking...

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.850
Fuck you!

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:20.522
- Fucking...
- Fucking loud-mouthed bitch!

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:24.220
You wanna take this? Shut up!

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.528
...learning how to break free
of living pay cheque to pay cheque.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.614
And the government can help you do that too!

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:48.534
There are programmes out there that will
pay you, like, $3,000 to pay your utility bills.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.037
Or $4,000 to pay your grocery bills.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:54.415
Or how about this? $10,000 to pay any bill!

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:58.127
But you have to know about the programmes.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.797
That's the key. The government
doesn't even know what it has.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:03.382
And you have to have
the right questions, too.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.452
You can call...

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:55.226
I warned you!

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.645
Um, I remember the first time

01:13:57.725 --> 01:14:02.775
I was emancipated from the foster system,
and I didn't have nowhere to go.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.821
The reason, um, I became homeless

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:10.783
is because, um,
I just couldn't afford the rent.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:15.358
The second time I became
homeless was domestic violence.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:21.335
- You look like shit.
- I stayed everywhere.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:26.549
On the side of the 1/6 freeway,
under the 405 freeway...

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.969
Um, I've slept behind dumpsters,

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.221
I've slept in squats,

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:37.171
which are, like, abandoned buildings
with no water, no lights, no nothing.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.390
When you were there, did you, uh...

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.767
did you kill anyone?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:49.395
No. No.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.452
I saw a lot of parts.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.746
You know, like body parts after bombings.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.943
But no, I never killed no one. Why?

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.414
I was just wondering.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.380
You do what you have to do.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.172
No matter what.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.224
Whatever it is you're doing,

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:30.394
there's someone doing
a whole lot worse, you know?

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.814
I guess.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.913
No, ain't no guess.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:41.707
You gotta remember that.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.793
No matter how bad you think you done,

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.963
there's someone somewhere doing
a whole lot worse, is doing it now.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.090
You think?

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.207
I mean, trust me, I know.

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:54.457
I fucking know.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.391
Ain't nothing you're doing is as bad

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.893
as what people are doing all the time
to each other.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:04.216
You know, what people just
close their eyes to and let happen.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:09.610
You know, I bet whatever it is
you're worried about

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.478
ain't nothing compared
to the shit that goes on.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.486
Yeah.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:38.305
Goodnight, Lewis.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.963
Goodnight, Milo.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.135
What?

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.275
Milo and Lewis.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.318
You know, it's like she gave us names

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:53.435
she knew would get our asses kicked.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.525
Yeah.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.692
I miss her.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.991
I miss her too.

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:25.714
Hi.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:30.351
Um... I'm sorry for leaving like that and...

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:33.069
and for not speaking to you.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.862
I don't...

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:41.026
I wasn't snooping. I was just...
I was just looking for a pen and paper.

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:47.449
I didn't even really know what it meant,
but it...

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.669
but it kind of freaked me out.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:54.298
I mean, I shouldn't have just left like that.
I'm sorry.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:56.335
It's fine.

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:03.224
So... so, what was all that?

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.558
Are you...

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:10.225
are you working on a book about vampires
and a crazy killer or something?

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:14.513
It's nothing that matters any more.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:19.185
Really? Cos it seemed really detailed.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.943
Did you come up here to write more?

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.076
I'm not writing any more. I'm making a plan.

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:03.617
Shit, are you just giving all this to me?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.579
- Yeah.
- Why the fuck would you do that?

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:09.915
So... so we can trust each other again.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.293
I never spoke to the cops.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.128
This stuff hot?

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.714
Yeah, very.

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.799
You got all this yourself?

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.843
- Yeah.
- How?

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.960
Uh... I break into places.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.336
It's a lot of valuable shit.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.061
So, we're cool?

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:33.856
Yeah, motherfucker, whatever.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:35.768
Okay.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.858
Wow.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.895
Lewis said girls like flowers.

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:22.644
We mostly do.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.502
Thanks.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.464
This was nice.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.683
Yeah.

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:11.173
- Hey.
- What?

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.840
What's with your fucking crazy eyes?

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.013
Huh?

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:20.429
Drink?

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:40.532
Wait.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.834
- I wanted to give you something.
- Really?

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.629
Yeah.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.805
It's for you to go to your cousin's.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.647
Where did you get it?

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.983
Don't tell anyone you have it.
Just... just go.

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:24.461
Do you want to come with me?
I mean, you have to come with me.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.046
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.882
You wouldn't like me in the end.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:31.670
I'm not good. I never will be.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:35.709
But I already know that you're crazy.

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:41.019
I'm not going. Just... just make sure you go.

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:42.691
Milo.

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.475
Go on, motherfucker!

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.935
Drop it! Drop that fucking gun!

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:30.903
Women's history, in this regard,

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:36.116
tries to merge two approaches
that have been used in the past.

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:40.281
There's contribution history,
which views women as...

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:49.206
- Can I go?
- You know we can't end early.

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:52.466
Can I draw?

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.503
What would you draw?

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.674
I've been drawing the sun a lot lately.

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:03.644
Hey, nice job cleaning the car.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.396
- Thank you.
- So you heard, huh?

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:07.898
No.

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:10.359
They arrested all of them.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:14.023
Andre, Troy, Mar. All of them.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.907
You mean all your old friends?

01:25:17.437 --> 01:25:18.994
Yeah.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:23.950
Don't remind me. You didn't know?

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:27.501
No. Why would I?

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:29.795
It's on the news, even.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.005
They say they killed that white boy
in the basement

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:34.793
- and some white family in the Village.
- Really?

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.636
You didn't know?

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:40.675
- No.
- Yeah.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:43.525
I just wanted to see if you'd left.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.490
Call me.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:24.284
Hey, freak.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:50.352
Now you're not calling me?

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.604
Call me back.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:54.721
Maybe come and meet me?

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:50.448
I read Twilight. I thought it sucked.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.659
Not very realistic at all.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:18.588
I've been thinking a lot,
and maybe a vampire can kill himself.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:25.470
I mean, maybe not kill himself,
but arrange it.

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:34.691
Like, if he could do something
and know that it would get him killed.

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.033
That would get around the rule, I think.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:59.059
I'm not... I'm not sure if vampires should...
are meant to be here.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:01.686
I mean, I know they've always been here.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:06.983
But I mean, if you can only exist
to hurt people, and you know better,

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:11.307
then maybe it's better to decide
not to exist at all.
