WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:09.405
<i>I'm Peggy Carter.</i>

00:09.480 --> 00:10.891
<i>- I work for the SSR,</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:13.566
<i>America's premier
covert intelligence agency.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:14.846
<i>But now that the war is over,</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:16.604
<i>my mission parameters
these days are...</i>

00:16.680 --> 00:18.091
Agent Carter, cover the phones.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.161
<i>...different.</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:20.730
<i>That all changed when an old friend</i>

00:20.800 --> 00:22.529
<i>asked me to become a double agent.</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:24.523
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.011
A couple of weeks later,
my inventions...

00:26.080 --> 00:27.923
They start turning up
on the black market.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.365
<i>He left me with an ally.</i>

00:29.440 --> 00:31.442
Edwin Jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.126
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.804
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.726
What did the lab rats say?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.689
They think it's some kind
of long-range transmitter.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.967
How long? Moscow-long?

00:44.360 --> 00:46.203
You can't reveal
that you found these items.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.850
They'll only use it to tear you down.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.004
- Call it in.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.047
We got the Stark stuff.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.281
Ease up on that, will you?

00:52.360 --> 00:53.600
I don't want to end up inside out.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.681
We're getting
promotions out of this.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.367
Watch where you're going.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.089
Krzeminski would still be with us today
if it wasn't for Howard Stark,

01:04.160 --> 01:05.400
whether he pulled the trigger or not.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.403
We're only neck-deep
in this mess because of him.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.682
You'll get your package
when we get our money.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.850
You think the deal's gonna go sour?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.922
Not with you, me,
and Jimmy standing guard.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.291
One-grand bills?
You ever even seen these?

01:42.360 --> 01:44.044
I can assure you
that is legal tender,

01:44.120 --> 01:46.964
and far easier to transport
than 50,000 singles.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.122
We'd believe you if we saw
an extra 100 of them.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.202
That was not
the agreed-upon amount.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.363
Mr. Mink does not smuggle goods
into this country for free, Mr. Jarvis.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.171
Now, the inherent value
of any commodity or service

02:06.240 --> 02:08.049
- should really have no effect...

02:08.320 --> 02:09.481
You were saying?

02:16.480 --> 02:17.527
Whoever's in there...

02:19.520 --> 02:22.649
50,000 American dollars.
That was our understanding.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.006
Fifty was for the delivery.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.327
The extra hundred's for us
to keep our traps shut.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.607
And I got three guys outside
that agree with me.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.084
Come out, or I'm coming in.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.325
Who's in there?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.560
We'll see if he can connect
when he gets out of the minors.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.321
What's that?

02:47.880 --> 02:49.006
Is that Jimmy?

03:03.160 --> 03:07.165
Now, I'm sorry, but I can't agree
to such, pardon my language...

03:08.440 --> 03:09.646
Extortion.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.124
It's not "extrorshing."
This is a shakedown.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.522
You could hand me the money,
or he could hand me the money.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.161
Very well.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.649
I have a further $50,000 in here.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.484
It's all I have.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.880
Take it or leave it.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.960
Count it.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.128
Sorry, you're counting
the ransom in front of me?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.129
Our boss is a very precise man.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.801
Your manners never cease
to disappoint.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.169
You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Jarvis.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.848
<i>Hopefully our package is intact.</i>

03:56.280 --> 04:00.001
- Ah, my favorite foreigners.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.922
Did Mr. Mink have his minions
blackmail you?

04:03.000 --> 04:03.967
Indeed, sir.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.451
You certainly know
how to pick your partners.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.763
Well, Mr. Mink is a greedy,
black-market smuggler, sure,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.922
but he got me
back into the country,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.048
and he's predictable in his greed.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.851
I like predictable, and I like greedy.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.807
And I was so close
to running the table.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.561
So, how are you two getting along?

04:29.240 --> 04:31.049
Peggy tried Anna's goulash?

04:31.120 --> 04:34.761
Peggy, Jarvis know you can do
107 one-armed pushups?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.524
Howard, you came back
to New York City

04:36.600 --> 04:39.080
risking notice from every
American intelligence agency.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.127
- Hmm.
- Why?

04:40.200 --> 04:42.567
Let's get back to my place.
We'll have some sherry.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.608
- I'll explain everything.
- Stop the car.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.966
- The residence is only a block away.
- What's the matter?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.691
See that man waiting for the bus?
That's Agent Yauch.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.127
You see that sedan
parked by the fire hydrant?

04:56.200 --> 04:58.487
That is Agent Henry. Make a left.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.123
That was my least-known property.
A dummy corporation holds the lease.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.288
And another dummy corporation
owns that company.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.283
The only people
who know about that penthouse

05:10.360 --> 05:13.011
besides me and Jarvis
are Lana Turner, Jane Russell...

05:13.080 --> 05:15.048
You do realize that my work
colleague Ray Krzeminski

05:15.120 --> 05:16.770
was killed
while you were out gallivanting?

05:16.840 --> 05:18.001
I was not gallivanting.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.969
The SSR blames you,
and they're out for blood.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.566
We must assume they're about to
uncover all of your residences,

05:22.640 --> 05:24.244
your bank accounts,
your corporations.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.290
So perhaps turning up
unexpectedly was not your best plan.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.080
So, where can I hide?

05:31.160 --> 05:32.241
God, help me.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.529
Take a right up ahead.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.521
Ah.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.889
The Griffith.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.249
How's Miriam?

06:11.040 --> 06:12.121
Get in.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.291
What? I hate small spaces.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.249
What if the chain snaps
and I fall to my death?

06:17.320 --> 06:19.322
Don't worry. I'll never reveal
that Howard Stark's dead body

06:19.440 --> 06:22.046
is lying rotting in the bottom
of a dumbwaiter shaft.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.166
What if I suffocate?

06:24.240 --> 06:26.083
If Miriam finds us,
we'll be much more comfortable

06:26.160 --> 06:28.003
in an electric chair.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.491
Just for the record, I...

06:31.960 --> 06:35.362
Miss Carter, of all the women
in this establishment,

06:35.440 --> 06:37.408
you are the one for whom
I am the most worried.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.289
Oh, what a dismaying sentiment.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.249
Well, the hours you keep
seem less that

06:41.320 --> 06:43.721
of a woman gainfully employed
as a telephone operator

06:43.840 --> 06:47.367
and more that of one who
frequents taxi dance halls.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.081
Uh, I was just doing my laundry.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.091
Do you know how many intruders
I have caught

06:53.160 --> 06:55.242
inside that very dumbwaiter,

06:55.320 --> 06:57.721
attempting to soil
the honor of some young lady?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.087
I am certain that many a woman

07:00.160 --> 07:02.242
owes her virtue to your watchful eye.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.765
There are always the rebellious.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.320
Alice Shaw once showed up
with her sister,

07:06.400 --> 07:09.483
whom I immediately recognized
as a man in a girdle.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.607
Oh.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.364
Allow me to show you to your room.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.247
Well...

07:17.320 --> 07:18.810
We'll walk together.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.602
You've been working all night
on the Stark case?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.921
I got something
on our dead Russians.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.206
We just got this...

07:27.720 --> 07:29.529
Official report on the Battle of Finow.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.364
Great. Only thing missing are words.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.011
Good, old US Army
intelligence for you.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.367
Redacted by
General John McGinnis.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.647
As luck would have it,
he died a month ago.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.249
What did the lab rats say
about your magic typewriter?

07:43.320 --> 07:45.163
They're claiming it sends
signals back and forth.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.446
To where, we don't know yet.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.769
Maybe it's time we send
a message to our enemies.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.330
I got another way
of talking to our enemies.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.160
What do you mean?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.208
Our intelligence indicates
the Russians were overrun

07:55.280 --> 07:57.851
by a Nazi regiment
at the Battle of Finow,

07:57.920 --> 08:00.321
led by this man,
Colonel Ernst Mueller.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.887
He's due to be executed
in two days

08:03.000 --> 08:05.367
for murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.329
If I leave now,
I might just make it in time.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.845
You're going
all the way to Germany?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.968
What's some Nazi gonna tell us
about Howard Stark?

08:11.720 --> 08:14.803
I got two Russians who both
reportedly died in Finow

08:14.880 --> 08:18.282
only to show up alive here,
looking for Stark's gizmos.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.683
Nobody, including
our own government,

08:20.760 --> 08:23.001
wants to talk about
what really happened in Finow.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.126
Chief, you're really gonna rely
on the word of a Nazi?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.726
Son, I'd let Göring give me a hickey

08:28.800 --> 08:30.404
if he'd get me to the bottom of this.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.450
Till I get back, you're in charge.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.361
Good luck, Chief.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.566
Thank you, Chief.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.363
Time and again,
I have caught women

08:51.440 --> 08:53.602
sneaking men
inside this sacred space.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.200
Every woman was ejected at once.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.045
Are you familiar
with the id and the ego?

08:59.120 --> 09:01.600
Are they children's characters?

09:01.680 --> 09:04.809
Mmm, good. It is unbecoming
for a lady to read Freud.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.884
But what you must understand
is that, until a certain age,

09:07.960 --> 09:10.201
you do not know
how to govern your own impulses.

09:10.320 --> 09:15.486
And that leaves me to defend
young women from compulsions.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.681
- Understood.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.000
- Miss Carter?
- Hmm?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.161
Your laundry?

09:41.520 --> 09:43.204
Good night, Miss Fry.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.283
It's nearly 6:00 a.m., Miss Carter.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.325
Howard!

10:24.920 --> 10:28.003
Yes? You just woke me.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.923
Not to worry.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.650
This is my cousin Peggy.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.041
- Peggy, Lorraine.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.290
Don't you think your cousin
looks just like Howard Stark?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.090
My cousin is a lot shorter.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.441
- And much better-looking.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.121
Come on, Peg.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.328
We got family business
to discuss.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.526
See ya.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.766
I'll order up some sausage,
eggs, couple of Bloody Marys.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.410
There's no room service, Howard.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.005
I'm getting dressed and going to work.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.241
So say what you have to say,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.243
and it better include when
you're leaving my apartment.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.163
I'm bound for Rio in three days.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.163
Before I depart, I need to know which
of my inventions you've recovered.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.446
Why?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.406
Well, if I know
what the SSR has obtained,

11:12.480 --> 11:15.051
I can determine how many
are still on the black market.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.361
But why are you here?
Why isn't Jarvis the one asking me?

11:17.440 --> 11:20.523
'Cause Jarvis doesn't have
one of these.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.122
- A camera-pen?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.085
"A camera-pen?"

11:28.160 --> 11:30.208
I was expecting
a little more enthusiasm.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.440
Any idea how long it took me
to figure out lens miniaturization?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.280
You don't have to get changed
with the door closed.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.325
I thought we were friends.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.442
Gather 'round. Come on.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.967
Okay, who here knows what
Ray Krzeminski's middle name was?

11:55.240 --> 11:56.287
Walter.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.490
That's right. Walter.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.047
Ray Walter Krzeminski.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.088
And who knows
what the most important part

12:03.200 --> 12:05.441
of agent Ray Walter Krzeminski's
name was?

12:05.520 --> 12:06.885
Hmm?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.164
Walter?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.647
No. "Agent."

12:12.320 --> 12:13.731
Just like all of us.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.167
Now, Chief Dooley's gone to
break a lead in the Stark case.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.402
And while he's gone, I'm in charge.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.563
And while I'm in charge,
none of you will be resting.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.246
So pick up your phones,
make kissy noises to your wives,

12:24.320 --> 12:27.642
'cause we're not going home
until we start cracking heads.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.006
And if you get tired,

12:29.480 --> 12:31.448
remember how important
your names are...

12:31.560 --> 12:32.971
Agents.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.765
Now, form a single file
up to my office,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.366
and I'll give you your
individual assignments. Come on.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.560
Not eager to see what job

12:41.640 --> 12:43.642
Commandant Thompson
has in store for you?

12:43.720 --> 12:45.006
You mean the lunch order?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.406
Where are you headed?

12:47.480 --> 12:49.323
The anonymous call
that led to the Stark weapons...

12:50.320 --> 12:53.290
I'm gonna see if I can pull a print
off the phone that rang it in.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.124
It was a public phone.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.884
The only thing you'll pull
is a bacterial infection.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.008
Hey, Sousa,
where do you think you're going?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.447
To do some real police work,
oh man of action.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.161
Hey, Sousa, you know,
now that Krzeminski's dead,

13:05.240 --> 13:06.571
that makes you our biggest yo-yo.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.328
Marge, start taking the lunch orders.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.683
- Mr. Doobin.
- Aah! Aah!

13:21.920 --> 13:23.888
Ah, Miss Carter.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.970
That was embarrassing.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.769
If you'd like to get
the lunch orders started,

13:27.840 --> 13:30.571
I should be able to pick up all
the meals for the lab by noon.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.166
How goes the research
on the Stark inventions?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.446
Whoa. I got it! I got it!

13:35.520 --> 13:38.171
Ah, it's been a bit of a challenge.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.887
- Do you see this switch?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.645
Every time that I push this switch,

13:45.760 --> 13:49.048
I get a shock that runs right up
my arm and into my skull.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.646
But do you see any other switch?

13:51.720 --> 13:52.960
I do not.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.005
Do you remember that, uh,
I used to wear glasses?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.685
Of course.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.091
It melted the glasses

13:59.160 --> 14:00.730
- right off of my face.
- Hmm.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.211
Now, is that the intended purpose?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.685
- Uh, I don't know.
- Hmm.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.287
But Howard Stark is either
an ignoramus or a genius.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.566
Most likely both.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.563
- Hmm.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.162
- I'll raise you a nickel.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.969
You gonna bet, or what?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.361
A nickel? Here you go.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.090
Come on.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.445
Got you.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.283
Afternoon, fellas.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.604
Hey, you want in on the action?
Ante's a nickel.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.923
No, sir. I just want to ask you
a couple questions.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.367
Either of you hear the commotion

14:38.480 --> 14:39.891
down by the wharf the other night

14:39.960 --> 14:41.291
by the boat called <i>The Heartbreak?</i>

14:41.400 --> 14:43.209
Depends. You got a nickel?

14:48.040 --> 14:49.121
Thanks.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.051
I didn't see a thing.
I camp down on 14th Street.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.561
Frank, here, though...

14:53.640 --> 14:55.529
You been here, what?
About a month, right?

14:58.600 --> 14:59.761
Keep your money.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.329
I don't play games with police.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.243
Frank, I just want to know
what you saw.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.731
Were you the one
who called in the tip?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.126
You called in a tip to the cops?

15:08.480 --> 15:11.051
I just said I ain't got
no business with Johnny Law.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.451
There must be some kind of...

15:16.280 --> 15:18.044
Well, I win this hand, I guess.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.448
I said $150,000.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.202
Mr. Mink, we were hoodwinked.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.682
Jarvis, he didn't come
by himself. He brought a girl.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.688
- And five guys.
- Or six.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.921
Yeah, six or seven guys.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.280
They, they beat the snot out of us,

15:39.360 --> 15:40.441
and there was nothing we could do.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.760
That... That's the truth, Mr. Mink.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.763
You are lying.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.764
Mr. Mink, I swear
I'm telling you the truth!

15:51.840 --> 15:53.126
What was the woman's name?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.645
I heard Stark call her "Peggy."

15:54.720 --> 15:56.484
I swear, if I could
just follow the butler,

15:56.600 --> 15:59.001
I'll... I'll find her,
the money, and Stark.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.969
The time for money has passed.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.850
No one crosses me.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.489
Wait.
You want them dead?

16:09.560 --> 16:11.130
I'll kill Stark and Peggy.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.401
No, I'll take care of it.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.929
Howard, I have the...

16:27.720 --> 16:28.960
Howard!

16:30.040 --> 16:31.769
Oh, for God's sake!

16:34.040 --> 16:36.247
Where are you now?

16:37.240 --> 16:38.287
You're back.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.601
Good. Uh, you know Helen?

16:42.680 --> 16:44.250
Helen, my cousin Peggy.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.769
You are disgusting.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.163
Hey, look, Agent Sousa
found Howard Stark.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.402
- We can all rest now!

16:58.480 --> 17:00.767
- Hey!
- Great job.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.969
No wonder we couldn't find him.
He looks rough.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.566
What are you doing, Sousa?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.881
He may have seen something
at the wharf before we arrived.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.042
The only thing that that man has
seen is the bottom of a bottle.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.486
Great job.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.407
She seems uninhibited.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.564
The first 10 or so might not be
suitable for your eyes.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.521
Your inventions.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.001
Who is that?

17:38.080 --> 17:39.127
Peggy!

17:40.800 --> 17:43.451
Communal dining's one of the joys
of residing at the Griffith.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.560
Peggy, are you in there?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.642
- Sounds nice.
- Uh, stay away.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.084
Uh, actually, Angie, I'm feeling
a little under the weather.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.446
No, Peggy, you should go.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.124
I worry about you.
You work too much.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.486
I'll look through the rest
of the photos myself.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.130
- Peg, are you sure?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.771
- You need Pepto?
- Coming.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.320
Hey, bring me back some ham,
would you? Preferably roasted.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.890
And some bread.
And potatoes, mashed.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.371
You know what I like. Surprise me.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.691
So, I walk into this diner.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.480
This isn't a joke.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.690
I walk into this diner,
and everybody starts clapping.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.370
And I look around at first,
confused,

18:28.440 --> 18:32.206
and then I realize,
oh, they're clapping for me,

18:33.200 --> 18:37.410
in my dress uniform, 'cause I served
and came back alive, like you.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.089
You and me ain't nothing alike.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.641
So, I pretended to curtsy...

18:43.720 --> 18:46.564
Played it off as a joke,
and then I'm working on my meal.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.483
I look up.
I see another GI walk in.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.962
So, I put down my fork,
put down my knife,

18:52.040 --> 18:53.804
get ready to clap...

18:54.640 --> 18:56.290
And nobody else does a thing.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.280
Silence.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.201
That's when I realized
they weren't clapping for me.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.727
They were clapping
for this and this...

19:07.840 --> 19:10.207
Clapping because
I make them feel guilty,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.804
and they want to feel good.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.483
You think because
I'm wearing a suit

19:17.560 --> 19:19.881
and I got a clean shave,
we're different? We're not.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.566
We're both people
nobody cares about.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.641
No one clapped
when I came home.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.442
One guy was sleeping
with my wife.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.121
Another took my job at the mill.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.002
We all got sad stories.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.401
<i>I still don't talk to cops,
even pathetic ones.</i>

19:54.000 --> 19:56.048
I'd clap, but I don't
want to hurt your feelings.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.451
- Send him packing,

19:57.520 --> 19:59.045
and start looking for Stark
like everybody else.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.451
I'm telling you, he's a witness.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.088
Dooley went all the way to
Nuremberg to interview a Nazi,

20:03.160 --> 20:06.130
and I've got you clamoring over
a bum you found down the street.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.487
Think about it.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.648
If he didn't see something,
he'd say so.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.485
He saw something.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.887
These rolls keep for three days,
four if it's cold

20:27.960 --> 20:29.291
and you put them
out on the windowsill.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.761
Oh, uh, glad to hear it.
Um, I don't often steal food.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.241
Are you kidding? Carol once fit
a whole chicken down her sweater.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.970
My mom knit
a special chicken pocket.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.369
Gloria's got a compartment
in her pocketbook

20:38.440 --> 20:40.363
that can fit a cup of gravy.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.282
Well, would you look at that?

20:43.640 --> 20:45.369
Uh, I'm going to eat in my room.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.602
I have the last five pages
of the new Agatha Christie.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.761
Good night.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.849
Could you make me one of those
that holds pickles?

20:55.520 --> 20:58.171
- All of my inventions are in your lab.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.531
Then why is your mustache
so sad?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.608
I need you
to steal one of them back.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.481
Every one of these inventions
from my vault

21:13.560 --> 21:15.050
can cause large-scale destruction.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.044
Thankfully, they're not all active,

21:17.120 --> 21:19.566
but this one... This one is.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.051
What does it do?

21:21.480 --> 21:24.848
London was antsy about Germany
dropping bombs on her,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.400
so I created the Blitzkrieg Button.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.206
You press the button,

21:29.280 --> 21:31.567
and you get
an instant city-wide blackout.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.563
The bombers
can't see where to unload.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.609
So, essentially,
it's a glorified light switch?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.170
- Hmm.
- What's the problem?

21:38.040 --> 21:40.520
I couldn't figure out
how to turn the lights back on.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.046
They went out because
the electrical grids were destroyed.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.970
If that thing
is activated in New York,

21:45.040 --> 21:46.326
the whole tri-state area

21:46.400 --> 21:48.641
will be plunged into the Dark Ages
for years to come.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.484
Nothing's ever easy.
How do I defuse it?

21:50.560 --> 21:53.086
Well, that's the whole reason I'm here.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.810
I'm the only one that can turn it off.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.530
I thought you were here
because of the camera-pen.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.766
This is a mockup.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.125
You swap that round
with the real thing,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.210
no one will be the wiser.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.851
I'll figure out a way
of telling the technicians

22:06.920 --> 22:08.445
what the button does
without having them touch it.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.922
Since when has the US military
ever had a weapon that they didn't use?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.729
Don't let anyone touch it.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.922
I'm already considered a traitor, Peggy.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.244
Don't let me be the guy who shut down
the greatest city on the planet.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.602
Ready for another adventure,
Mr. Jarvis?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.760
You understand I do not care

22:40.880 --> 22:43.121
about whatever petty crimes
you may have committed.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.522
Sorry. Don't mind me.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.163
Just here for the dinner show.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.369
I just want to know what you saw.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.726
Thompson.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.687
Mmm.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.922
- Thompson.
- Ah, that's good Scotch.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.926
Thompson.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.204
Thompson,
what are you doing?

23:06.320 --> 23:07.321
Smells good.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.125
You see that?

23:10.760 --> 23:12.967
All-American cow.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.560
Thompson, that's enough.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.642
Smells good.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.490
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.607
Okay, Thompson,
that's enough.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.808
- It tastes even better.
- Agent, you should leave!

23:23.680 --> 23:24.886
I'll tell you what.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.802
You tell us
what you saw at the boatyard...

23:28.840 --> 23:30.285
This is all yours.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.727
There was a guy, duds all fancy.
He was with a woman.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.810
They got on and off the boat
before police showed up.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.126
Was it this woman?

23:42.160 --> 23:43.241
No.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.126
She had dark hair.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.201
What else?

23:47.320 --> 23:48.367
That's all.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.926
It was far away.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.650
I hid when the cops came.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.646
Mmm-hmm.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.081
Mmm.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.448
Not everybody came back
from the war wanting a hug.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.846
Sir?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.923
They are measuring
me for my new necktie.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.967
Please excuse the gallows humor.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.204
Colonel Mueller, can we sit?

24:48.360 --> 24:50.408
May I offer you some water?

24:55.400 --> 24:57.004
Do you know these men?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.201
These are Germans?

25:01.280 --> 25:02.645
Russians.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.609
They're said to have died
in the Battle of Finow.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.603
You familiar with that battle?

25:07.040 --> 25:08.405
I was in Finow.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.890
What can you tell me?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.681
You tell me what happened
in the Battle of Finow...

25:20.160 --> 25:21.685
I'll help you escape.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.201
Park around the corner.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.691
When I get the real
Blitzkrieg Button out,

25:28.760 --> 25:30.046
drive us back to the Griffith.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.360
With my heaviest foot.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.851
There's just a single switch on it, right?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.089
Yes, correct.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.689
Are you all right, Mr. Jarvis?

25:40.240 --> 25:43.323
I'm simply nervous
on your account, Miss Carter.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.050
Howard came back to New York
for this one invention, right?

25:48.120 --> 25:50.282
It was a risk
he knew he had to take.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.529
You don't think he's planning
on using the device himself

25:53.600 --> 25:55.728
to wipe out a city's
electricity, do you?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.641
Of course not.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.288
At least the Blitzkrieg Button
isn't like Nitramene.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.567
I mean, well, if I was
to accidentally activate it,

26:04.640 --> 26:06.244
no one would get hurt.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.402
Just bring the device back
as fast as you can, Miss Carter,

26:10.480 --> 26:12.323
and then we can all stop worrying.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.608
Your man, General Wilhelm Keitel...

26:29.680 --> 26:31.170
You know he was hanged yesterday?

26:32.480 --> 26:33.891
Twenty-five minutes.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.849
That's how long it took for him to die.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.208
Swinging on the rope, gagging...

26:38.720 --> 26:40.165
Horrible way to go.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.481
See, they don't realize
that you have to measure

26:42.560 --> 26:45.211
the condemned's weight
as well as the height. Otherwise...

26:49.560 --> 26:50.846
Cyanide.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.922
You get a painless death,

26:55.520 --> 26:59.002
and nobody gets the satisfaction
of watching you hang.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.724
Now, tell me what happened
in the Battle of Finow.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.208
There was no Battle of Finow.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.731
Because you Nazis
ambushed the Russians at night.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.043
No German fought
any Russian at Finow.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.931
What we found can only be
described as a massacre.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.724
Bodies piled high
and ripped apart.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.044
Whoever attacked them
was long gone.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.091
Yeah, I'm having trouble
stomaching your story.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.963
I've killed many people...

27:36.560 --> 27:39.769
Men, women, and children.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.802
No person died by German hands

27:43.880 --> 27:45.405
at Finow.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.004
I'm gonna need a phone.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.691
Breath mint?

28:08.080 --> 28:10.526
Wasted our time
and Dooley's scotch.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.364
You have a good nose, Agent.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.602
You sniffed out a witness
everyone overlooked.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.441
Yeah, who saw a well-dressed man
and a dark-haired woman.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.246
Cracked the case wide open.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.926
<i>Now we know Howard Stark
likes to hang out with women.</i>

28:24.000 --> 28:25.286
Something you learn in war...

28:26.120 --> 28:28.407
Not every battle you win
is a notch on your belt.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.921
The way I hear you fought,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.525
I'm surprised there's any belt
left to notch.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.129
Just doing
what needed to be done.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.645
Didn't we all?

28:38.320 --> 28:40.846
Hey, Sousa,
where did you get that lead?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.560
Russia? Italy?

28:43.200 --> 28:44.964
My femur, actually.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.723
<i>There's just
a single switch on it, right?</i>

29:36.360 --> 29:37.885
Yes, correct.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.210
Are you all right, Mr. Jarvis?

29:40.640 --> 29:43.610
<i>Just bring the device back
as fast as you can, Miss Carter.</i>

30:22.240 --> 30:23.924
Marge...

30:24.640 --> 30:26.847
Didn't I say only the men
have to work overtime?

30:26.920 --> 30:28.160
I didn't mean to interrupt you

30:28.240 --> 30:30.846
enjoying the rewards
of your promotion.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.401
Why do you work here?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.921
To uphold democracy.
Did you need a reminder?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.927
But the rest of us get to do
more than take lunch orders.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.964
You'll never know the thrill
of learning whether or not

30:41.040 --> 30:43.168
Agent Yauch is in the mood
for a club sandwich.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.481
Hmm.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.763
You're trying
to hide something, Peggy.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.285
And the only one you're fooling is you.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.331
And what's that, Agent Thompson?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.803
The natural order of the universe.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.691
You're a woman.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.771
No man will ever
consider you an equal.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.441
It's sad,

31:12.280 --> 31:13.884
but it doesn't make it any less true.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.042
I can always come to you
for the truth.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.961
Good night.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.891
You get it?

31:52.560 --> 31:53.721
What's in the vial?

31:54.600 --> 31:55.681
What vial?

31:55.800 --> 31:57.689
What is in the vial?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.047
You opened it.

32:00.520 --> 32:01.726
You know how, uh,
dangerous that could be?

32:01.800 --> 32:03.165
What's in the vial, Howard?

32:03.400 --> 32:04.686
Okay, you're angry.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.565
I'm not angry.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.006
I'm just curious.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.166
What's in the vial?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.200
You know.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.806
We both know.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.281
I don't. Tell me.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.806
Steve Rogers' blood.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.571
I have some flowers for Peggy.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.005
May I deliver them to her?

32:40.080 --> 32:42.242
You may not. Give them here.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.731
Are you the delivery man
or her suitor?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.206
I love her.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.766
Young man, please tell me...

32:58.840 --> 33:02.083
Your name and profession.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.646
Ah.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.324
Can't say I'm surprised.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.010
You used me. You lied to me.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.047
You hit me!

33:11.120 --> 33:13.646
You don't get to use my reaction
to your lies as the reason for your lies.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.489
Yeah, I do.
I knew how much Steve meant to you,

33:15.560 --> 33:17.164
because I know
how much he means to me.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.366
I was protecting you.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.408
Oh, don't pretend this is
about me and my emotions.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.561
You were out to protect you.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.847
Yeah, I didn't want to see
this turmoil that you're in. Look at you.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.649
I trusted you, Howard!

33:25.720 --> 33:28.291
Yeah, I know, and I was wrong.
But you have to understand,

33:28.400 --> 33:30.243
a kid like me doesn't get
to where I'm at by doing...

33:30.360 --> 33:31.771
What, wanted for treason?

33:31.840 --> 33:34.002
I grew up on the Lower East Side.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.846
My father sold fruit. My mother
sewed shirtwaists for a factory.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.089
Let me tell you, you don't get
to climb the American ladder

33:40.160 --> 33:42.049
without picking up
some bad habits on the way.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.202
There's a ceiling for certain
types of people based on

33:44.280 --> 33:45.964
how much money
your parents have,

33:46.040 --> 33:49.089
your social class,
your religion, your sex.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.603
And the only way to break
through that ceiling sometimes

33:51.680 --> 33:54.081
is to lie, so that's
my natural instinct, to lie.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.883
I shouldn't have lied to you.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.967
For that, trust me,
I am truly sorry.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.682
Why did you have
Steve's blood in the first place?

34:05.040 --> 34:08.965
I was one of the lead scientists
on Project Rebirth.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.011
Eleven vials went to the government,
one vial went to me.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.003
Does the SSR know
they have the vial?

34:14.080 --> 34:15.320
Why shouldn't
they have it?

34:16.040 --> 34:17.643
The government's
almost through their supply.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.370
If they know they have mine,
they'll never give it back,

34:19.440 --> 34:20.601
even if you clear my name.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.001
That still doesn't mean that you
deserve to have Steve's blood.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.846
You know, I believe
that sample SR-53,

34:25.920 --> 34:27.809
that blood,
Captain America's blood,

34:28.199 --> 34:30.487
holds the key to vaccines,
medications,

34:30.560 --> 34:32.483
possibly even a cure
for the common cold.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.764
Steve Rogers
may not still be with us,

34:35.840 --> 34:37.842
but he can still save
millions of people.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.725
And how many millions of dollars
are you set to make?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.165
What the hell do you think of me?

34:43.239 --> 34:47.040
I think you're a man out for his own gain
no matter who you're charging.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.690
You are constantly finding holes
to slither your way into

34:50.760 --> 34:52.091
in the hope
of finding loose change,

34:52.159 --> 34:54.003
only to cry when you're bitten
by another snake.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.966
You're a man who says,
"I love you,"

34:56.040 --> 34:58.361
whilst looking over a woman's
shoulder into the mirror.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.850
Steve Rogers dedicated his mind,
his body, his life

35:01.920 --> 35:05.481
to the SSR and to this country,
not to your bank account.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.088
I made the same pledge,
but I'm not as good as Steve was.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.209
I forgot my pledge running around
for you like a corporate spy.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.964
So thank you, Howard,
for reminding me

35:13.040 --> 35:15.247
who Steve was
and what I aspire to be.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.087
For all I know,
you did steal your inventions.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.286
Peggy...

35:19.360 --> 35:22.011
I need some fresh air
to get away from your stink.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.286
When I'm back, you'll be gone.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.964
Where to? I'll get caught.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.122
You're the genius. You figure it out.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.524
Well, hey, mister, are you lost?

36:05.640 --> 36:06.880
Young woman, return to your room.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.440
Are... Are you looking for Peggy?

36:09.560 --> 36:11.483
Return to your room, please.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.724
Is that pistol an automatic?

36:16.880 --> 36:18.291
I want that.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.441
Taxi!

36:34.800 --> 36:35.961
Did you know?

36:36.040 --> 36:38.520
I truly regret
the way this matter was handled.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.489
I'll take that as a "yes."

36:40.560 --> 36:43.450
Don't ever play poker.
You rub your ear when you lie.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.285
Mr. Stark respects you,
Miss Carter, as do I.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.605
Is there anyone else alive who
holds you in such high esteem?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.648
I can trust the actions
of men who don't respect me

36:51.720 --> 36:52.801
more than those who do.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.645
At least when they ask
for something, they mean it.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.166
You took her for granted.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.329
You can get her back.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.801
Over the last five years,

37:10.880 --> 37:13.565
I thought I'd built up a callus
apologizing for you.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.445
But this stings.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.491
Hey.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.241
Could I borrow the sports section?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.171
Thank you.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.529
- Göring a good kisser?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.051
That's actually
kind of funny, Thompson.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.202
Yeah.
So, how's your Nazi colonel?

38:14.600 --> 38:17.843
Uh, about this time,
he should be two inches taller.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.524
Did you find out about Finow?

38:19.600 --> 38:21.887
Mueller said there were
Russian bodies everywhere,

38:21.960 --> 38:23.530
ripped to pieces.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.487
Question is, who killed them?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.929
These guys?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.365
No, two couldn't kill hundreds.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.169
And why were they listed
among the dead?

38:34.040 --> 38:36.691
Unless they assumed the identities
of men who actually died there.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.488
I've got a new wrinkle for your forehead.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.130
Log at the Finow airfield.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.487
One day after our supposed battle,
a plane lands.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.891
Guess who's on it?

38:44.960 --> 38:46.371
I don't know. Bob Hope?

38:48.720 --> 38:50.210
Howard Stark.

38:55.520 --> 38:56.851
Pour some Scotch.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.604
Make it a double.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.608
We got ourselves a conspiracy.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.685
Dottie, are you coming to dinner?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.724
I'll meet you downstairs in a jiffy!
