02:39.354 --> 02:40.653
And the drinking?

02:40.663 --> 02:43.360
I've been having a hard time sleeping.

02:43.511 --> 02:46.680
And my husband and i,
weren't doing well.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.749
It was a really bad time.

02:49.818 --> 02:51.524
And..

02:51.757 --> 02:55.735
I started having a few drinks to..

02:55.968 --> 02:57.586
Knock myself out.

02:57.706 --> 03:02.091
And when that didn't kill it,
i had pain meds.

03:02.695 --> 03:05.355
Your husband said that you were
suspended from the bar.

03:05.389 --> 03:07.984
No, i wasn't suspended.
-Oh.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.925
Okay, he mentioned..

03:09.968 --> 03:12.126
I was put on probation.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.919
One morning,
i was late to court.

03:13.944 --> 03:18.061
And the judge chastised me..

03:18.138 --> 03:20.071
I just lost it.

03:20.270 --> 03:23.592
I don't know what he said, but..

03:23.808 --> 03:27.113
He ordered a breathalyzer test and..

03:27.173 --> 03:29.995
I was put on probation.

03:30.306 --> 03:32.118
I wasn't suspended.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.295
Must've been difficult for you
to tell me all that.

03:41.418 --> 03:43.549
Will it get me my daughter back?

04:05.456 --> 04:07.044
I need another case.

04:07.104 --> 04:08.470
Preferably,
one i can win.

04:08.504 --> 04:10.662
Miss McCall, your work here
is considered restitution.

04:10.679 --> 04:12.111
You don't get to pick and choose.

04:12.154 --> 04:15.921
One part of my life i haven't completely fucked up is my record in court.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.457
I'd like to keep it that way.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.124
This is a goddamn Habeas case,
i'm a civil defense attorney.

04:20.147 --> 04:21.644
It's essentially a civil action,

04:21.690 --> 04:24.292
i'm sure you'll find the rules our victim plead is discoverably familiar.

04:24.336 --> 04:26.989
Come on, you must have people
who are better qualified.

04:27.024 --> 04:30.681
We try to provide destitute women access to the very best legal counsel available.

04:30.695 --> 04:34.939
At the moment, the best counsel we have to offer Lacey Stubbs is you.

04:36.774 --> 04:40.889
She was just moved from Valley State
to CWCF.

04:41.386 --> 04:42.221
Why?

04:42.341 --> 04:45.176
She was moved after being raped
repeatedly.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.729
By her guard.

04:47.847 --> 04:49.511
So you're saying,
i can't refuse?

04:49.545 --> 04:50.788
Of course you can.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.205
And i can refuse to recommend you
be taken off probation.

04:59.306 --> 05:01.266
You're all set,
have a great flight.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.085
When the cops first arrested her,
she said yeah..

05:04.106 --> 05:06.606
She and her friend went over to the victim's house
with a rope and a butcher knife..

05:06.726 --> 05:08.230
But only to frighten her, and then..

05:08.262 --> 05:12.691
Later, things got out of hands and whoops
she accidently slit the girl's throat.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.229
Hate when that happens.

05:14.243 --> 05:16.811
Later, she changed the story
and says the boyfriend did it.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.491
Look at her.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.983
Does she like
to play dress up?

05:21.003 --> 05:22.798
It's a fucking freak show.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.102
The DA's got the best friend
saying Lacey did it.

05:25.143 --> 05:28.853
The boyfriend saying Lacey did it,
even the victim said Lacey did it, right before she died.

05:28.874 --> 05:31.877
The mind is like..
-It's a loser.

05:32.195 --> 05:36.080
Come on, Cate. You're doing great,
you really are.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.810
I feel like shit.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.184
You're all set.

05:39.198 --> 05:41.145
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:41.511 --> 05:44.035
Feelings aren't facts.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.686
Give me a hug.

05:49.869 --> 05:53.589
Just call me, everyday.
Okay?

05:53.823 --> 05:55.377
Yeah.

06:31.643 --> 06:33.389
Hold the other gate.

06:44.712 --> 06:45.622
Hey Snow White.

06:45.663 --> 06:46.878
Shut up.

06:46.926 --> 06:49.087
Stubbs, you got a visitor.

06:51.047 --> 06:53.518
You understand what
a Habeas Petition is?

06:53.638 --> 06:57.081
I think so, after you lose all your appeals,
you go to the..

06:57.102 --> 06:58.681
Essentially you're telling a federal judge..

06:58.721 --> 07:00.986
That you believe your imprisonement was unconstitutional.

07:01.035 --> 07:04.401
Because the state court that convicted you
made a legal or factual error.

07:04.435 --> 07:06.734
I've been keeping list
of all the mistakes.

07:06.762 --> 07:10.374
You have to persuade the judge
that there was significant trial error.

07:10.415 --> 07:12.224
I didn't kill Jen.

07:13.690 --> 07:16.444
Honestly, whether you're guilty or innocent
is beside the point.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.005
She went out with my boyfriend
when i was pregnant.

07:19.067 --> 07:22.698
I screamed at her, i said terrible things to her,
but i didn't kill her.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.881
So, why did you tell the cops
that you did?

07:24.908 --> 07:28.215
Because i didn't want to send my baby's dad
to the gas chamber.

07:28.995 --> 07:32.063
And then when i found out
he lied to me about everything..

07:33.719 --> 07:37.454
Including never loving me or the baby,
i had to tell the cops the truth.

07:37.778 --> 07:38.986
Which is what?

07:39.235 --> 07:42.041
Me and Dorrie just went over there
to scare her.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.126
But Dorrie just lost it.

07:45.997 --> 07:48.521
She was screaming in Jen's face
and pushed her really hard.

07:48.641 --> 07:50.251
Jen hit her head.

07:51.016 --> 07:53.412
And i tried to pull her off, but..

07:53.771 --> 07:55.379
She was just gone.

07:57.506 --> 08:01.254
She was stralling her and hacking off
her head with a butcher knife.

08:02.027 --> 08:04.747
There was all this blood..

08:05.272 --> 08:09.009
I ran outside to tell Rusty,
he said he'd take care of it.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.435
And a couple minutes later, they came running out..

08:12.555 --> 08:14.828
And told me to get in the car.

08:14.948 --> 08:17.047
So, Rusty killed her?

08:17.420 --> 08:19.107
And why would he do that?

08:19.227 --> 08:21.751
She was telling everyone
he raped her.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.641
He was afraid that she'd press charges.

08:24.683 --> 08:26.319
Was it true?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.597
That he raped her?

08:30.869 --> 08:33.740
Rusty, he raped me on our second date.

08:36.687 --> 08:40.364
So why would Dorrie tell the police
that it was you?

08:40.412 --> 08:42.034
Cause i told her to.

08:42.385 --> 08:45.828
We were in trailer, and he said
that he'd get the death penalty.

08:45.869 --> 08:48.154
And they go lighter on a girl.

08:50.477 --> 08:52.037
Unfortunately,
when you changed your story..

08:52.065 --> 08:54.543
You look at me like i'm shit,
i'm not shit.

08:54.598 --> 08:56.444
Maybe i didn't do
everything right..

08:56.458 --> 08:59.233
Or go to college or have
a perfect life like you.

08:59.268 --> 09:01.391
But i have a kid out there
that i'm not raising because..

09:01.412 --> 09:04.905
My shitty lawyer and the DA fucked me over
and gave me life without parole..

09:04.939 --> 09:07.409
When i wasn't even there.

09:11.068 --> 09:13.212
I'll look at your list.

09:19.803 --> 09:21.287
Getting everything
organized?

09:21.326 --> 09:23.600
I'm packing.

09:24.418 --> 09:25.677
taking a trip?

09:26.883 --> 09:28.496
Uh-uh.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.296
Can i come to?

09:31.485 --> 09:34.892
Just me and daddy
and blue dog.

09:37.083 --> 09:41.173
I'm gonna have a rainbow room
and a fish.

09:42.085 --> 09:43.895
That sounds nice.

09:43.926 --> 09:46.003
We have to take
a plane.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.619
To your rainbow room?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.782
For daddy's new job.

09:50.545 --> 09:52.071
Daddy has a new job?

09:52.119 --> 09:55.075
Uh-um, in Seattle.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.445
You never see her anyway!
-I see her!

09:58.485 --> 10:01.482
You're either off having a mental breakdown
or you're too busy working.

10:01.506 --> 10:03.622
One of us had to earn
some money.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.604
Sorry, i'm sorry.
I know i fucked up.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.642
But you can't do this.

10:08.728 --> 10:11.238
You can't take her to another state.
I'm her mom.

10:11.285 --> 10:12.918
You'll always be her mom.

10:13.516 --> 10:16.104
I'm just not gonna let you
keep hurting her.

10:21.407 --> 10:25.228
While you were in rehab,
Josh has de facto sole custudy.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.792
We're working against him,
and not an unpleasant evidence.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.595
I've been going to meetings.

10:30.715 --> 10:33.034
And working this pro bono case
so i can get off probation.

10:33.073 --> 10:36.179
I'm completely fucking sober
except a cigarette here and there.

10:36.211 --> 10:37.509
Are you seeing Augie?

10:37.525 --> 10:40.199
I'd be seeing a lot more of her
if i had any kind of help.

10:40.435 --> 10:43.213
This case i'm working on..
-Spend time with your kid, Cate.

10:43.584 --> 10:46.354
We need to make you present
in her life again.

10:50.213 --> 10:52.491
I'm having a really tough week
this week.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.280
Gotta lots of stuff going on,
trying to..

10:56.314 --> 10:57.720
You know.

10:57.789 --> 11:00.007
Figure out..

11:00.385 --> 11:02.933
I have a really hard time surrendering.

11:03.317 --> 11:04.809
I've been..

11:05.113 --> 11:07.612
Pretending to give up
control, but..

11:07.652 --> 11:12.163
I still want what i want,
i still want certain outcomes, you know?

11:12.540 --> 11:14.613
So i start bargaining.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.690
And then i start making deals
with God.

11:18.682 --> 11:20.290
"If You do this for me.."

11:20.410 --> 11:23.571
"I will have another month sober".

11:24.427 --> 11:27.188
And then i start feeling guilty about
how i'm working my program.

11:27.213 --> 11:29.737
Or how i'm not working my program.

11:32.035 --> 11:36.016
So how's Augie and what has she done?

11:36.733 --> 11:39.162
She accused me
of being perfect.

11:42.013 --> 11:45.337
It's nice to know
i can still fool somebody.

11:46.023 --> 11:49.386
Hey, are you okay?

11:51.752 --> 11:54.101
I got a text from
Wilson George.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.592
Maybe i should just call him,
he's on my list.

11:57.620 --> 12:01.036
The idea isn't to
endanger yourself.

12:01.156 --> 12:03.399
Why don't you just change
your number?

12:03.433 --> 12:05.100
I like my number.

12:05.281 --> 12:08.355
Wilson George may have been cleared.

12:08.376 --> 12:11.091
But he is still dangerous.

12:15.797 --> 12:18.331
Had you been treated
for alcohol addiction?

12:18.360 --> 12:21.032
Or depression prior to your state
clear haven?

12:21.075 --> 12:21.946
No.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.816
Do you want to tell me
about it?

12:25.327 --> 12:26.936
Do i want to?

12:32.356 --> 12:34.531
I was working in
the DA's office.

12:34.935 --> 12:35.988
This was..

12:36.250 --> 12:37.909
12 years ago.

12:38.029 --> 12:39.319
It was 12.

12:40.162 --> 12:43.783
And i was assigned this..

12:44.088 --> 12:47.593
It was a rape murder
of a 6 years old girl.

12:47.962 --> 12:49.202
And i've seen some..

12:49.478 --> 12:53.199
Horrible awful things,
but this one was just..

12:53.447 --> 12:54.670
Beyond.

12:54.862 --> 12:58.582
I made it my mission to
put this guy away.

12:59.015 --> 13:03.536
And so when i got the conviction,
i felt great and then..

13:03.798 --> 13:06.287
When the jury sends him
to die..

13:06.308 --> 13:09.643
I felt like i did
something right.

13:10.203 --> 13:13.212
For a long time,
i didn't really think about it.

13:13.254 --> 13:18.425
Except that i was glad that
he wasn't out there hurting anybody.

13:19.892 --> 13:22.433
And so, i was deep
into another case.

13:22.455 --> 13:24.765
I'd left the Prosecutors Office
a few years before.

13:24.786 --> 13:28.094
And i got a call,
they had tested semen samples.

13:28.214 --> 13:29.950
Taken from the girl's sock.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.043
And, i guess..

13:33.248 --> 13:34.996
Technology had advanced to..

13:35.031 --> 13:38.475
Where they were able to determine
based on the new..

13:38.684 --> 13:40.335
DNA evidence that..

13:41.036 --> 13:45.911
That it wasn't actually Wilson George
and he was innocent.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.874
I felt like..

13:48.994 --> 13:51.206
Everything that i knew..

13:51.915 --> 13:53.417
Everything that i..

13:53.757 --> 13:56.099
Felt good about was..

13:56.595 --> 13:59.812
Was wrong. False.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.546
They got Dorrie's testimony,
they got Rusty's testimony.

14:07.582 --> 14:09.457
And they got the victim's
pretty stricken mother..

14:09.500 --> 14:12.547
Standing up there saying her daughter's last word
was "Lacey did it".

14:12.575 --> 14:14.094
But it's a lie.

14:14.377 --> 14:16.911
My lawyer said he spoke to some medical examiner guy that said..

14:16.947 --> 14:18.839
There's no way Jen
could've said i did it.

14:18.881 --> 14:20.817
Because her throat was
sliced through.

14:21.157 --> 14:22.454
Who?
Ennis?

14:22.674 --> 14:24.856
I read his testimony,
that's not what he said in court.

14:24.885 --> 14:27.270
I know, but that's what he told
my lawyer.

14:27.327 --> 14:29.651
So there's no way she could say anything.

14:48.358 --> 14:50.002
Dr. Ennis?

14:50.931 --> 14:52.154
Yes?

14:52.927 --> 14:55.329
Do you do consulting work
on trials?

14:55.364 --> 14:57.308
Yes, yes that's right.
Excuse me.

14:57.428 --> 15:00.263
So, i could hire you
to give testimony.

15:00.689 --> 15:01.923
Well..

15:02.759 --> 15:05.700
We work primarily with
Law Enforcement,

15:05.820 --> 15:08.029
Police, DA's office mainly.

15:08.149 --> 15:09.276
And they keep you
busy enough?

15:09.333 --> 15:10.842
Oh yeah, they keep us
really busy.

15:10.906 --> 15:13.011
I'd say 99,9% of our work..

15:13.033 --> 15:14.429
Comes from
Law Enforcement.

15:14.549 --> 15:18.621
So, you wouldn't just
change your opinion because..

15:18.650 --> 15:20.357
Somebody called you
and asked you to.

15:20.428 --> 15:23.630
Like, say one of the DAs
who gives you all that business.

15:24.005 --> 15:25.408
No, of course not.

15:25.451 --> 15:28.765
Because 5 years ago,
you told Lacey Stubbs' lawyer that..

15:28.786 --> 15:30.455
Jennifer Cole couldn't have spoken.

15:30.533 --> 15:32.893
And then in court you changed your mind
and said..

15:32.936 --> 15:36.638
She could've spoken in somewhat slurred
less intelligable manner.

15:36.695 --> 15:39.345
Sounds like a pretty big change,
don't you think?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.087
Says the DA admitted to calling you
and then..

15:42.129 --> 15:45.970
When the judge asked if you felt treathened
or intimidated, you said no.

15:46.197 --> 15:46.800
Right.

15:46.814 --> 15:50.280
Eventhough 99,9% of your business
was at stake?

15:52.545 --> 15:54.019
You should leave now.

15:56.648 --> 15:58.050
So they tampered with him?

15:58.149 --> 15:59.878
Sure as hell looks like it.

15:59.928 --> 16:03.617
This isn't a simple appeal,
i need to reinvestigate the case.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.544
I don't have a big money firm
backing me here.

16:06.579 --> 16:09.620
No in-house PI,
no team of paralegals.

16:09.825 --> 16:11.079
I don't even have an office.

16:11.122 --> 16:12.886
There he is.

16:13.596 --> 16:15.956
Doesn't that just scream serenity?

16:16.020 --> 16:18.691
Criminal defense is
your world.

16:20.732 --> 16:21.930
You're not gonna answer me?

16:21.951 --> 16:24.197
Was there a question back there
somewhere?

16:24.317 --> 16:27.234
I need to find out what rock Rusty Berkhart crawled under..

16:27.354 --> 16:29.627
After he served his whopping 3 months.

16:29.645 --> 16:31.990
3 months for acessory to murder?

16:32.018 --> 16:34.777
Hindering apprehention, DA cut him a sweetheart deal..

16:34.897 --> 16:36.580
In exchange for testifying against Lacey.

16:36.588 --> 16:39.090
And i need to talk
to Dorrie Booth.

16:40.245 --> 16:41.712
Are you asking me
for help?

16:41.747 --> 16:43.405
Like you're so busy.

16:43.525 --> 16:44.965
What do i get?

16:45.546 --> 16:48.607
My undying love and continue to steam.

16:48.650 --> 16:50.221
Oh..

16:50.582 --> 16:51.730
Fine, i'll blow you.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.417
Now we're talking.

16:54.929 --> 16:57.799
So you know, i supported Josh for years
while he was trying to get this..

16:57.813 --> 17:01.311
Video game launched,
and that project belt..

17:02.098 --> 17:03.063
Hold on.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.031
Who is it?

17:06.082 --> 17:07.618
Where were you?

17:11.477 --> 17:13.246
Sorry.
So yeah..

17:13.296 --> 17:15.698
So, i support him
and i'm the dead beat?

17:16.148 --> 17:20.656
It's wrong, and i guess i was hoping
that you guys can talk some sense into him.

17:21.259 --> 17:22.631
I don't want to..

17:22.886 --> 17:24.416
Missed you tonight.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.068
I don't want to..

17:26.117 --> 17:28.845
Talk for hours and hours
on your machine.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.124
But i love you both.

17:31.152 --> 17:34.114
And hope we can talk soon.

17:36.504 --> 17:38.488
Josh's parents won't even pick up the phone.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.042
I'm ranting on
their voicemail.

17:40.063 --> 17:43.557
A meeting is like a raffle,
you must be present to win.

17:43.755 --> 17:46.697
Are you trying to make me jump
out of the window?

17:47.738 --> 17:48.957
Did you eat?

17:49.077 --> 17:51.799
I had a yogurt,
made me feel so much better.

17:53.231 --> 17:55.496
One of my other friends..

17:55.539 --> 17:57.339
Made me a lovely
batch of soup.

17:57.374 --> 17:59.575
Seriously, did you just come over here
to guilt trip me?

17:59.611 --> 18:00.766
No.

18:00.971 --> 18:04.403
No Cate, i came here to enable you.

18:05.268 --> 18:06.324
Okay.

18:06.402 --> 18:10.281
Both Dorrie and Rusty are
still guests of the state.

18:10.899 --> 18:14.048
Dorrie won't talk
or doesn't want to talk.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.951
But Rusty is willing.

18:16.042 --> 18:17.733
For a small fee.

18:17.853 --> 18:19.092
Rusty's still in jail?

18:19.127 --> 18:20.163
Yes, he is.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.721
Apparently he and the DA
are no longer sweethearts.

18:28.516 --> 18:30.470
Lacey and Dorrie don't agree
on much.

18:30.491 --> 18:33.471
But they both said that you drove them
to the condo.

18:34.063 --> 18:35.319
Yeah.

18:36.461 --> 18:37.778
I dropped them off.

18:37.813 --> 18:39.943
Lacey said when she came out and told you what was going on..

18:40.063 --> 18:42.404
That you ran inside to take care of it.

18:44.518 --> 18:46.112
Lacey's a liar.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.867
Is it a lie that you raped her
on your second date?

18:50.396 --> 18:53.236
Is it a lie that you raped her
on your second date?

18:53.278 --> 18:55.201
What can i say?
The bitch liked it rough.

18:55.293 --> 18:58.984
Did Jen Cole like it rough too,
when you sodomized her in the back of your van?

18:59.577 --> 19:00.889
No.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.123
That was a pitty fuck.

19:06.447 --> 19:09.090
So what happened to the deal
that you cut with the DA?

19:09.794 --> 19:11.041
I don't know.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.995
Ask them.
-I did ask them..

19:13.016 --> 19:16.158
They said they yanked your deal because you lied under oath at Lacey's trial.

19:16.208 --> 19:19.005
About a list of questions that she slipped you
when you're both in county.

19:19.068 --> 19:21.564
Questions that you were good enough
to answer in writing.

19:21.593 --> 19:25.080
Question, if i cover up that you helped Dorrie killed Jen..

19:25.094 --> 19:28.391
Do you promise to love forever
and never beat my face again?

19:28.405 --> 19:30.237
Your written answer,
I promise.

19:30.258 --> 19:31.554
She changed the question.

19:31.575 --> 19:34.223
That's what you said under oath,
but the DA knew it wasn't true..

19:34.251 --> 19:37.660
Because their own expert found
that the handwriting were yours and Lacey's.

19:37.758 --> 19:40.527
With no changes or alterations.

19:40.548 --> 19:43.042
I don't care what the expert said,
Lacey's a liar.

19:43.063 --> 19:44.466
She's a liar?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.080
Are we done here?

19:48.122 --> 19:49.038
Yeah, we're done.

19:49.820 --> 19:50.905
Guard!

19:52.993 --> 19:56.240
And the problem is, i can't get the discovery i need to prove we deserve a hearing..

19:56.360 --> 19:58.116
Until after the judge grants one.

19:58.236 --> 19:59.845
What's "discovery"?

19:59.888 --> 20:01.473
Witness statements..

20:01.508 --> 20:05.102
Police reports, evidence,
interviews.

20:05.652 --> 20:08.865
So if they found an earring in Jen's condo
with blood on it..

20:08.921 --> 20:10.718
They have to give it to you?

20:11.077 --> 20:14.001
The cops found an earring
with Jen's blood on it?

20:15.568 --> 20:16.963
Was it yours?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.887
No, it was Rusty's.

20:19.112 --> 20:21.274
They kept it
out of evidence.

20:21.500 --> 20:25.537
My lawyer said it wouldn't help me anyway
cause Rusty told them the earring was mine.

20:25.755 --> 20:29.905
Which never made sense to me, cause if the cops really thought they had my earring..

20:29.934 --> 20:31.839
Which includes blood on it..

20:32.191 --> 20:33.692
Why didn't they use it
against me?

20:33.720 --> 20:35.270
That's a good question.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.852
So, we got witness tampering..

20:38.909 --> 20:41.396
Suggest.. You have to prove it.

20:41.516 --> 20:43.936
Perjury testimony.
-That's your best shot.

20:44.162 --> 20:46.728
And the fact that the DA knew that..

20:46.799 --> 20:49.941
half of Rusty's testimony
was malarkey.

20:49.955 --> 20:52.106
They didn't even bother to go back
and inform the court.

20:52.156 --> 20:53.529
That's not nothing.

20:53.727 --> 20:56.609
Let's just hope that this judge..
What's his name?

20:56.658 --> 20:59.004
Sumnter, agrees.

20:59.265 --> 21:00.765
Jameson Sumnter?

21:00.970 --> 21:01.942
Yeah.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.669
Friend of yours?

21:03.867 --> 21:07.129
He was one of my law school profs.

21:07.192 --> 21:08.977
Huge victim's rights guy.

21:09.005 --> 21:10.689
That's not good.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.746
Really bad kisser.

21:15.887 --> 21:17.832
He really liked his students.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.026
Particulary
the female ones.

21:23.669 --> 21:26.155
Mr Barker, you ought to be
in a good mood this morning.

21:26.176 --> 21:29.664
I'd like to point out to the court
my celebratory Cardinal end goal.

21:29.685 --> 21:32.402
By the skin of their teeth, Mr Barker.

21:32.881 --> 21:35.128
You're a football fan, Miss McCall?

21:35.192 --> 21:37.368
No, Your Honor.

21:40.017 --> 21:41.484
Do i know you?

21:41.723 --> 21:45.331
I was in your victim's rights seminar
at UCLA.

21:45.451 --> 21:47.431
Did you learn a few things?

21:47.713 --> 21:48.995
More than a few.

21:49.031 --> 21:50.116
Glad to hear it.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.520
Mr Barker..

21:51.640 --> 21:55.887
Apparently i was Miss McCall's law professor, do you have a problem with that?

21:56.183 --> 21:57.254
No sir.

21:57.303 --> 22:00.699
Miss McCall, do you have a problem with
my sitting on the bench in this case?

22:00.762 --> 22:03.362
As i recall, you passed me, sir.

22:04.074 --> 22:05.936
I'll take that as a no.

22:07.465 --> 22:10.887
Well, Miss McCall..
Your petition raises..

22:10.943 --> 22:16.374
Sufficient reasons to wonder at the quality of justice administered in Miss Stubbs' trial..

22:16.910 --> 22:19.228
I'm going to grant your request
for unlimited discovery.

22:19.270 --> 22:22.772
Your Honor, i'm concerned that without limits
the discovery process..

22:22.800 --> 22:24.287
Would become unreasonably burdensome.

22:24.308 --> 22:25.484
Mr Barker.

22:25.879 --> 22:28.732
Miss McCall can very well
get to the bottom of whether or not..

22:28.753 --> 22:32.444
This case was prosecuted in the manner
befitting the grade state of California..

22:32.458 --> 22:36.432
Unless she has all the facts and evidence
before her.

22:37.012 --> 22:38.097
Can't she?

22:38.780 --> 22:40.584
The hearing is set forth..

22:40.619 --> 22:42.127
November 7th.

22:43.635 --> 22:45.896
Coupons from Dunkin Donuts.

22:46.593 --> 22:48.199
Dry cleaning receipts.

22:48.319 --> 22:50.989
They're trying to bury us
under an avalanche of crap.

22:51.109 --> 22:55.094
You want to hear your horoscop
for June 16th, 2006?

22:55.123 --> 22:57.376
Phone leads from
7 other cases.

22:57.411 --> 23:02.090
You'll be on a learning curve
as your horizons are broaden.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.211
A memo says..

23:04.331 --> 23:08.703
Police took a statement from a neighbor
named CeeCee Claymans, day of.

23:09.599 --> 23:10.339
No.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.896
No?
-Don't have it.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.453
When was this?

23:14.059 --> 23:16.109
Before i lost it.

23:19.475 --> 23:20.934
Did you hear what he said?

23:20.955 --> 23:22.477
No, play it again.

23:23.538 --> 23:24.863
Do you recognize this?

23:24.940 --> 23:26.011
Yeah.

23:26.617 --> 23:27.928
It's my earring.

23:28.244 --> 23:28.652
I..

23:28.687 --> 23:30.139
Rusty?
-Yup.

23:30.787 --> 23:33.352
Lacey said she liked it,
so i gave it to her.

23:33.904 --> 23:35.905
You gave this earring to Lacey?

23:36.102 --> 23:37.357
When was this?

23:38.660 --> 23:40.246
Before i lost it.

23:43.114 --> 23:44.591
They're coaching him.

23:44.626 --> 23:47.416
But he still can't get it right.
-no.

23:47.874 --> 23:50.279
It's unbelievable.

23:51.575 --> 23:54.809
Do you have any idea why the cops
might want to protect Rusty?

23:55.820 --> 23:57.919
They hang out sometimes.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.716
They were friends?

24:00.047 --> 24:05.014
Welch and Rusty played poker together a few times,
and paintball.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.310
Maybe it wasn't so much they were..

24:07.352 --> 24:10.142
Protecting Rusty as they were hurting me though.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.347
Why would they want
to hurt you?

24:16.032 --> 24:19.718
If your story doesn't make sense,
we're gonna lose, do you understand that?

24:22.843 --> 24:25.203
Why would the cops want
to hurt you, Lacey?

24:28.119 --> 24:29.401
I don't know.

24:38.843 --> 24:40.646
How about number 48?

24:41.006 --> 24:42.929
Can you make out
what that says?

24:43.235 --> 24:45.159
Yes, it looks like "earring".

24:45.553 --> 24:48.294
Any idea what earring that might
refer to?

24:48.541 --> 24:52.402
I believe that was a CZ stud..

24:52.431 --> 24:56.490
Belonging to Lacey Stubbs, which we found
in the Cole residence.

24:56.504 --> 24:58.886
If i remember correctly,
there was blood on it.

24:58.921 --> 25:01.397
Rusty Berkhart has a pierced ear, also.

25:01.446 --> 25:04.103
Is it possible that the earring
might have belonged to him?

25:04.173 --> 25:08.314
I questioned him about it,
and he stated that he had given it to Miss Stubbs.

25:08.772 --> 25:12.445
If you had Lacey Stubbs' earring
with Jen Cole's blood on it..

25:12.565 --> 25:15.136
Why wasn't it admitted into evidence
at the trial?

25:15.520 --> 25:16.668
It got lost.

25:16.703 --> 25:17.711
It got lost?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.437
Yeah. That's right.

25:20.515 --> 25:24.475
Detective Welch, prior to
Jen Cole's murder..

25:24.595 --> 25:26.901
Did you know Rusty Berkhart socially?

25:27.233 --> 25:28.444
I'd seen him around.

25:28.458 --> 25:29.994
Ever played poker with him?

25:30.030 --> 25:31.644
No, i mean..
Maybe.

25:31.672 --> 25:34.293
Ever played paintball
with Mr. Berkhart?

25:34.680 --> 25:35.649
I don't remember.

25:35.685 --> 25:36.791
What about Lacey?

25:36.798 --> 25:37.531
What about her?

25:37.552 --> 25:39.468
Did you ever see her
socially?

25:41.180 --> 25:41.751
No.

25:41.758 --> 25:43.977
She wasn't around
when you're playing poker with Rusty?

25:44.006 --> 25:44.907
I have no idea.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.620
You think you might remember
if she had been?

25:46.648 --> 25:48.691
She's an attractive girl, right?

25:48.727 --> 25:51.474
Somebody a man might notice.
-This is bullshit.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.676
Did you and Lacey
ever date?

25:53.698 --> 25:54.832
I'm a married man.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.107
Is that a no?

25:57.357 --> 25:59.640
I don't know what
you're trying to do here, but..

25:59.689 --> 26:01.655
I've never done anything
with Lacey Stubbs..

26:01.691 --> 26:02.924
I never said that you did.

26:02.945 --> 26:04.411
I just asked
if you've dated her.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.834
Okay, for the record..

26:05.855 --> 26:09.928
For the record, i never talked to her,
never looked at her, never laid a hand on her.

26:09.949 --> 26:12.803
Until i arrested her.
-Never laid a hand on her.

26:12.817 --> 26:14.318
Fuck, i'm done.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.826
We need to take a break.
-It's okay, it's all i have.

26:16.861 --> 26:19.612
You can tell that fucking cunt,
if she wants to talk shit about me again..

26:19.626 --> 26:21.402
She's gonna regret it.

26:24.203 --> 26:27.465
Lacey, i need to know what happened
between you and Detective Welch.

26:27.810 --> 26:29.452
I can't.

26:29.699 --> 26:32.172
He said he'd hurt my baby.

26:35.567 --> 26:37.117
I gotta go.

26:43.916 --> 26:44.740
Hello..

26:58.897 --> 27:00.588
Ma'am, you mind coming with me?

27:00.609 --> 27:02.223
I wasn't drunk.

27:03.026 --> 27:04.083
Somebody hit me.

27:04.104 --> 27:05.647
It's just routine.

27:06.331 --> 27:08.113
Take a nice breath please.

27:10.831 --> 27:12.409
I'm so sorry.

27:12.437 --> 27:14.051
I called your cell
a million times.

27:14.079 --> 27:15.361
Are you okay?

27:15.389 --> 27:17.433
I'm okay, my car is destroyed.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.590
Somebody tried to run me
over the road.

27:19.977 --> 27:22.500
The police had me
file a report, then..

27:22.535 --> 27:24.085
Paramedics didn't want me to leave.

27:24.113 --> 27:26.135
Okay, we'll just..

27:26.199 --> 27:27.594
We'll schedule another session.

27:27.636 --> 27:29.502
No, i'm okay.
Please, i'm here.

27:29.538 --> 27:32.018
Can we just..
-I'm sorry, i have another appointment.

27:37.224 --> 27:38.274
I'm sorry..

28:23.607 --> 28:25.425
If i go and tell the judge..

28:25.545 --> 28:27.640
That the cops framed you
for murder..

28:27.795 --> 28:29.402
He's gonna want to know why.

28:36.850 --> 28:40.288
I called the cops, wanted him arrested,
he beat my face.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.519
He just went ballistic.

28:45.450 --> 28:49.145
a couple weeks later,
the day before my 18th birthday.

28:49.800 --> 28:54.369
Welch and another cop showed up,
asking if i want to press charges.

28:56.313 --> 28:58.969
I said no, cause we already made up.

28:59.412 --> 29:04.018
Then Welch started acting all weird,
and asked me if i'm alone.

29:05.118 --> 29:09.400
I got a sick feeling,
and tried to keep them outside, but..

29:09.457 --> 29:11.423
They were both on me.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.381
And i could see Rusty..

29:13.416 --> 29:16.410
Staring on me from the yard.

29:19.942 --> 29:23.825
They held me down, and Welch punched me
in my face.

29:24.311 --> 29:27.276
He said, he heard i liked it rough.

29:27.396 --> 29:31.158
Cause Rusty told them, that's why he did it.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.793
They took turned.

29:36.497 --> 29:37.582
Why didn't she report?

29:37.603 --> 29:39.400
Who's she gonna report it to?

29:39.491 --> 29:41.239
Her boyfriend rapes her..

29:41.359 --> 29:44.638
The cops rape her, she goes to jail
and the guards rape her.

29:44.843 --> 29:46.742
It's amazing she's as intact
as she is.

29:46.798 --> 29:48.348
Intact for a murderer.

29:48.390 --> 29:49.602
I don't think she did it.

29:49.631 --> 29:50.730
Really?

29:50.758 --> 29:52.605
Cops needed a guilty party.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.162
They're afraid Lacey will nail them on the rape,
and she gets the death penalty..

29:55.197 --> 29:57.156
They kill two birds with one stone.

29:57.276 --> 30:00.005
The DA isn't gonna play along
with this.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.372
They didn't know.

30:01.407 --> 30:04.572
They rely on what the cops gave them,
the cops fed them Lacey.

30:04.622 --> 30:06.834
It's fucking de ja vu.

30:39.264 --> 30:41.350
We're all waiting, Miss McCall.

30:41.893 --> 30:43.168
Of course.

30:58.053 --> 31:02.090
Lacey Stubbs maybe guilty in having bad taste in boyfriends.

31:02.179 --> 31:04.339
Of being naive.

31:04.970 --> 31:09.182
Of standing by an abusive man
and lying to protect them.

31:10.257 --> 31:13.561
But she's not guilty of murdering Jennifer Cole.

31:14.389 --> 31:17.028
When i first took this case,
i believed she was guilty.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.257
I'd read the news reports..

31:19.494 --> 31:22.463
She looked like a bad girl,
straight out of the tabloids.

31:22.583 --> 31:25.411
But that's not the real Lacey Stubbs.

31:30.691 --> 31:32.053
This is .

31:32.872 --> 31:36.113
This photo was taken two months before Lacey started dating the real killer..

31:36.233 --> 31:37.996
Rusty Berkhart.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.964
Rusty transformed Lacey
to his taste.

31:41.003 --> 31:45.377
Attempting to change a girl next door
into a dangerous femme fatale.

31:45.831 --> 31:48.133
He didn't actually succeed.

31:49.790 --> 31:54.237
Lacey Stubb is not the dangerous person in this courtroom today.

31:56.111 --> 31:57.413
They are.

32:02.423 --> 32:03.468
Quiet.

32:04.016 --> 32:06.626
It sounds outrageous, doesn't it?

32:07.187 --> 32:10.239
But Lacey's in prison
not because she's actually guilty.

32:10.359 --> 32:13.239
But because DA Brinkerhoff
and the Hawthorne County PD..

32:13.282 --> 32:17.558
Decided she was guilty and set about
fabricating a case against her.

32:18.177 --> 32:20.019
They withheld evidence.

32:20.846 --> 32:23.022
They surpressed witness statements.

32:23.449 --> 32:26.194
They coerced the defense witness
to change key testimony..

32:26.229 --> 32:29.327
And then they invited the real killer,
Rusty Berkhart, to take the stand..

32:29.369 --> 32:31.339
And claimed that Lacey had confessed.

32:31.396 --> 32:32.595
To him.

32:36.108 --> 32:39.506
Police and prosecutors considered
Lacey Stubb trash.

32:39.890 --> 32:43.256
And they threw her life away without so much
as a backward glance.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.065
If it can happen to her..

32:46.464 --> 32:48.583
It can happen
to anyone of us.

32:49.507 --> 32:51.050
It can happen to me.

32:51.918 --> 32:53.290
It can happen to you.

33:08.255 --> 33:10.715
Guess you can't keep
a good woman down.

33:11.846 --> 33:13.296
Walk away.

33:13.588 --> 33:15.359
It's gonna get ugly.

33:15.479 --> 33:17.037
What's the matter, Brinkerhoff?

33:17.157 --> 33:19.612
Afraid i'm gonna air
your dirty laundry?

33:19.732 --> 33:22.933
If you air mine,
i'll be force to air yours.

33:23.053 --> 33:25.728
And we both know
you got a shitload.

33:46.057 --> 33:47.324
Hello?

33:47.608 --> 33:50.915
Well, the good news is
you're very photogenic.

33:51.398 --> 33:52.652
What?

33:53.100 --> 33:55.588
You might want to look
at the paper.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.065
Motherfucker.

34:06.158 --> 34:07.609
So now you know.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.331
I'm not perfect.

34:09.346 --> 34:11.859
I've made mistakes just like you,
big ones.

34:12.435 --> 34:14.301
If you want to get a new lawyer,
that's your prerogative.

34:14.335 --> 34:17.496
But i am fucking good at what i do,
and i intend to win this.

34:17.616 --> 34:19.097
Not just because it's important to me.

34:19.117 --> 34:20.732
But because i think
you're innocent.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.605
And i think you got
a raw deal.

34:22.652 --> 34:25.199
But you said it didn't matter
if i was innocent.

34:26.036 --> 34:27.338
It matters to me.

34:28.596 --> 34:30.204
Dr. Miranchandi..

34:30.456 --> 34:32.492
Once the corroted has severed..

34:32.710 --> 34:34.830
How long can a person
remain conscious?

34:34.949 --> 34:36.900
Without medical intervention..

34:36.989 --> 34:38.426
Typically a matter of minutes.

34:38.501 --> 34:40.728
So, unless Hazel Cole arrived home within minutes..

34:40.849 --> 34:42.793
Of her daughter being attacked..

34:42.819 --> 34:45.585
She couldn't possibly have heard her
saying anything, is that correct?

34:45.641 --> 34:46.880
That's correct.

34:47.194 --> 34:51.393
A car with a kind of patchwork paint job
came toward me.

34:51.427 --> 34:53.784
Swirving over
into my lane.

34:54.478 --> 34:56.060
Looked like
he was drunk.

34:56.155 --> 34:58.022
The driver was a man, Miss Claymans?

34:58.042 --> 34:59.350
Yes, he was.

34:59.418 --> 35:01.058
Should i say who he was?

35:01.085 --> 35:02.338
If you know.

35:02.488 --> 35:04.218
It was Rusty Berkhart.

35:04.293 --> 35:06.244
And you told all this
to the detectives?

35:06.272 --> 35:07.688
I sure did.

35:07.709 --> 35:11.476
They asked me if i'd be willing to come to court to testify, i said i would..

35:11.544 --> 35:13.301
But they never called me.

35:13.601 --> 35:17.164
Are you aware of Miss Stubbs' claim
that she threw a pink garbage bag..

35:17.218 --> 35:19.950
Containing a butcher knife
with Rusty Berkhart's fingerprints on it..

35:19.956 --> 35:21.469
Into Dehunger River?

35:21.564 --> 35:25.051
I can't say that i actually heard her
saying that now.

35:25.092 --> 35:28.687
I'm reading from Lacey's January 26th statement.

35:29.245 --> 35:31.582
I put the knife
into a pink trash bag.

35:31.623 --> 35:35.469
I drove over to Stoneyville bridge
and threw it in.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.997
Is that a question?

35:39.541 --> 35:41.537
Did police search
the Dehunger River?

35:41.769 --> 35:44.032
I believe so,
no bag was found.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.062
And did you participate
in that search?

35:46.076 --> 35:47.493
No, i did not.

35:49.107 --> 35:50.142
You didn't?

35:50.182 --> 35:51.722
No, i did not.

35:52.253 --> 35:54.802
This is the tape of the search
the police gave to the defense.

35:54.823 --> 35:56.852
Just before Miss Stubbs' trial.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.706
Have you ever seen this tape before?

35:58.734 --> 36:00.048
I'm aware of it.

36:00.648 --> 36:02.535
No pink bag was found.

36:03.306 --> 36:05.247
The police were searching for a pink bag..

36:05.288 --> 36:07.230
Because Lacey have told
detectives..

36:07.257 --> 36:10.369
That she had put the murder weapon with Rusty Berkhart's fingerprints on it..

36:10.403 --> 36:11.922
Into a pink trash bag.

36:11.956 --> 36:14.737
And thrown it into the
Dehunger River, correct?

36:14.784 --> 36:16.446
But we never found it.

36:20.275 --> 36:21.701
Here's another tape.

36:21.821 --> 36:25.025
This was wasn't shown at my client's trial,
5 years ago.

36:25.071 --> 36:27.931
It contains the exact same footage
of the lake search.

36:28.005 --> 36:31.254
Only this one happens to be
a minute longer.

36:31.374 --> 36:33.489
Any idea what that might be?

36:33.516 --> 36:34.574
No ma'am.

36:34.638 --> 36:37.187
But you're certain you didn't participate
in the search?

36:37.224 --> 36:38.512
That is correct.

36:41.755 --> 36:44.652
So, Detective Duncan..

36:46.704 --> 36:48.417
That's not you?

36:50.337 --> 36:51.647
That looks like me.

36:51.712 --> 36:53.786
Because it is you, isn't it?

36:55.756 --> 36:58.466
What do you think that
might be, Detective?

36:58.852 --> 37:00.712
Looks like something
caught in the branch.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.438
A pink bag, maybe?

37:02.502 --> 37:04.465
Oh there you are again.

37:05.495 --> 37:07.934
Would it surprise you to learn that
the footage of the pink bag..

37:07.970 --> 37:10.118
And the footage of you
waving at the cameraman..

37:10.154 --> 37:14.954
To stop filming were not on the tape
given to Lacey Stubbs' counsel before the trial?

37:15.198 --> 37:16.972
I just want to say..

37:17.248 --> 37:18.661
After seeing this tape..

37:18.705 --> 37:20.443
My memory is refreshed.

37:20.563 --> 37:24.163
That bag has just..
I think..

37:24.432 --> 37:25.792
Diapers or something.

37:25.879 --> 37:27.595
So, now you remember the bag?

37:28.370 --> 37:29.417
You just showed it.

37:29.475 --> 37:31.206
Which is why
you remember it, right?

37:31.242 --> 37:34.016
Because, your memory was refreshed.

37:34.997 --> 37:37.847
Are you certain that the bag
contains diapers and not..

37:37.884 --> 37:40.463
A butcher knife
with Rusty Berkhart's fingerprints on it?

37:40.514 --> 37:41.656
I'm certain.

37:41.976 --> 37:43.612
As certain as you were..

37:43.735 --> 37:45.685
That you did not participate
in this search.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.001
Oh thank you.
-You're welcome.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.639
And if the lion comes..

38:26.726 --> 38:30.588
Daddy roars at the lion.

38:30.836 --> 38:34.889
And chase it all the way back
to the jungle.

38:36.813 --> 38:40.637
And if the panda comes..

38:40.870 --> 38:43.493
Daddy would..

38:43.613 --> 38:48.545
At the panda, and chase it all the way back
to the jungle.

38:48.665 --> 38:50.472
And if the bear comes..

38:50.494 --> 38:52.533
Mommy will grab that bear..

38:52.562 --> 38:53.994
No.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.743
Mommy can't play?

38:56.953 --> 38:59.274
This is a daddy game.

39:03.530 --> 39:07.412
This is a photocopy of Hazel Cole's statement
dated December 27th.

39:07.747 --> 39:09.815
The one that you took,
is that correct?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.135
Yes.

39:12.542 --> 39:16.425
Do you see any mention of Hazel Cole
saying she heard her daughter said Lacey did it?

39:16.476 --> 39:18.490
I remember her saying it.

39:18.527 --> 39:20.041
But is it in the statement?

39:20.114 --> 39:22.535
It's probably in a later statement.

39:23.517 --> 39:27.925
Here's another statement that you took,
3 weeks later on January 25th.

39:28.514 --> 39:30.063
Is it mentioned here?

39:32.673 --> 39:33.742
No.

39:33.952 --> 39:36.130
If Hazel Cole have mentioned it..

39:36.159 --> 39:39.671
As she held her dying daughter in her arms,
she had heard the words..

39:39.751 --> 39:40.966
Lacey did it..

39:41.003 --> 39:43.395
Is that something that you would
typically include in your report?

39:43.431 --> 39:45.913
She probably mentioned it
at a future time.

39:45.942 --> 39:49.864
You mean after you suggested that it may help you made a case against Lacey Stubbs.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.495
Objection.
-Sustained.

39:51.648 --> 39:53.458
Do you remember Hazel Cole
calling you..

39:53.498 --> 39:56.697
To say that she found an earring,
several weeks after the murder?

39:56.755 --> 39:58.142
Yes, i do.

39:58.215 --> 40:01.094
And do you remember Rusty Berkhart
saying the earring was his?

40:01.727 --> 40:03.529
No, i don't remember that.

40:03.565 --> 40:06.452
Your Honor, defense exhibit number 17.

40:08.743 --> 40:10.146
You recognize this?

40:10.190 --> 40:10.939
Yeah.

40:10.975 --> 40:11.986
What is it?

40:12.015 --> 40:13.341
It's my earring.

40:13.377 --> 40:14.933
Okay..

40:16.737 --> 40:19.765
Detective Welch, do you recognize
the two voices on that tape?

40:19.801 --> 40:21.626
Yes, i do.
It's me and Rusty Berkhart.

40:21.655 --> 40:23.980
And who did Rusty said
the earring belong to?

40:24.024 --> 40:28.062
If you played the tape further on, he changes it..
-I'm not talking about after you coached him.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.941
I'm asking you right there,
when you first asked the question.

40:32.282 --> 40:35.556
Did Rusty Berkhart say the earring was his?
Yes or no?

40:38.370 --> 40:39.635
Yes.

40:55.037 --> 40:57.555
He held his gun to my throat..

40:57.933 --> 41:00.470
Then he moved it down
between my legs..

41:00.507 --> 41:02.953
Then he pushed it inside of me.

41:04.102 --> 41:06.552
I could feel the cold steel in me.

41:06.567 --> 41:09.115
While he moved it, in and out.

41:10.162 --> 41:13.818
Can you remember anything about the gun?
What it looked like?

41:14.363 --> 41:16.872
It had letters engraved
in the handle.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.802
Could you read
what they were?

41:18.846 --> 41:20.809
It said RAW.

41:21.805 --> 41:24.986
Lacey, did you know either of the men
who raped you?

41:25.583 --> 41:28.843
One of them was friends with Rusty,
Robert Welch.

41:28.894 --> 41:31.025
And what happened then?

41:32.108 --> 41:35.166
He got off of me,
and said if i opened my mouth..

41:35.286 --> 41:38.584
They would come back and do
the same thing to my kid.

41:39.144 --> 41:43.361
Did you ever see Detective Robert Welch again
after the rape?

41:44.326 --> 41:46.885
He was the one who arrested me.

41:47.162 --> 41:48.747
Thank you.

41:50.673 --> 41:53.740
Mr Davies, please ask our friends in the Sheriff Office..

41:53.860 --> 41:55.925
To locate Detective Welch.

41:56.045 --> 41:58.198
And invite him back into
my court room.

41:58.241 --> 42:00.503
I want to warn the prosecution.

42:00.532 --> 42:04.548
I don't want anyone to discuss
with Mr Welch..

42:04.781 --> 42:06.420
What was just brought up
in here.

42:06.456 --> 42:08.201
Call him.
-I'm on it.

42:08.230 --> 42:10.400
Is there a problem, Mr Barker?

42:11.869 --> 42:16.292
Your Honor, my associate maybe on the phone
with Detective Welch right now.

42:16.314 --> 42:17.080
What?

42:17.102 --> 42:19.458
I asked him to call
as soon as the rape allegation..

42:19.480 --> 42:20.388
What, a minute ago?

42:20.425 --> 42:22.173
Obviously, this whole thing
is coming as a..

42:22.209 --> 42:25.605
God help you if someone
coached this witness.

42:26.205 --> 42:27.768
Do you hear me, Mr Barker?

42:27.783 --> 42:29.426
God help you.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.860
I have an incident report here
dated November 29th, 2007.

42:32.904 --> 42:35.728
Would you please take a look at it,
to refresh your memory?

42:38.840 --> 42:40.362
According to that report..

42:40.391 --> 42:43.082
Lacey Stubbs met you at the door
with a bloody face, saying..

42:43.104 --> 42:46.081
Rusty has a butcher knife,
i'm afraid he's going to kill me.

42:46.117 --> 42:47.426
Is that correct?

42:47.767 --> 42:49.009
Yes.

42:49.627 --> 42:51.648
And do you recall coming back
to the same trailer..

42:51.670 --> 42:53.612
Three weeks later
on November 29th?

42:53.619 --> 42:56.390
To see if Miss Stubbs
was intending to press charges?

42:56.936 --> 42:58.026
No, i do not.

42:58.055 --> 42:59.438
You don't remember that?

42:59.481 --> 43:01.161
No, it never happened.

43:01.183 --> 43:03.869
You don't remember pushing your way
into the trailer?

43:03.891 --> 43:07.039
And forcing Lacey Stubbs to have anal sex with you?
-Objection.

43:07.068 --> 43:08.013
Sustained.

43:08.035 --> 43:10.921
Where were you, Saturday November 29th, 2007?

43:10.972 --> 43:12.173
I have no idea.

43:12.216 --> 43:14.492
But you're sure you weren't raping
Lacey Stubbs?

43:14.536 --> 43:16.084
Objection.
-Sustained.

43:16.106 --> 43:17.673
Dead sure.

43:23.744 --> 43:25.096
Do you carry a gun?

43:25.133 --> 43:27.190
Yes, i do.
Always.

43:27.430 --> 43:28.869
May i see it?

43:42.142 --> 43:44.091
Is it engraved in any way?

43:47.307 --> 43:49.285
Yes, with my initials.

43:49.489 --> 43:51.364
RAW.

43:52.535 --> 43:53.457
Damnit.

43:53.504 --> 43:56.202
It's okay, you sucked.
That's fine.

43:58.784 --> 44:00.465
How do you like that?

44:00.474 --> 44:03.546
Prosecutor wants to negotiate on Simms.

44:03.556 --> 44:05.385
You can't leave,
i'm about to annihilate you.

44:05.429 --> 44:09.460
The wheels are just turning, my dear,
climbing down the innocent.

44:09.496 --> 44:10.714
What about my closing statement?

44:10.751 --> 44:13.397
Practice in the mirror
till i get back.

44:25.289 --> 44:27.319
The prosecution's case
against my client..

44:27.356 --> 44:30.228
Demands that you believe
2 incredible things.

44:30.348 --> 44:33.448
The testimony of a known perjuror
and probable killer..

44:33.485 --> 44:35.492
Who says that Lacey Stubbs
confessed to him..

44:35.513 --> 44:38.464
And the dubious claims
of Hazel Cole..

44:38.584 --> 44:41.569
Who said she heard her daughter say
Lacey did it.

44:41.591 --> 44:42.444
Excuse me.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.618
Is that a problem, Mr Barker?

44:44.938 --> 44:46.904
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

44:47.798 --> 44:50.658
Miss Cole would like a chance
to address the court..

44:50.687 --> 44:53.326
During my closing statement?
This is highly improper..

44:53.341 --> 44:55.302
I saw Rusty driving passed me..

44:55.346 --> 44:57.926
When i was coming home that morning too,
just before i found Jen.

44:57.963 --> 45:01.208
The court should not be considering this. All the testimony is in.
-Miss McCall.

45:01.328 --> 45:04.974
If this person has information that's relevant
to what actually happened..

45:05.011 --> 45:06.363
I want to hear it.

45:06.567 --> 45:08.374
Approach the bench.

45:15.207 --> 45:18.851
Are you telling us, Mrs Cole,
that after all this time..

45:18.971 --> 45:20.564
You're only just now remembering..

45:20.684 --> 45:23.736
What happened on the morning your daughter was killed?

45:23.856 --> 45:25.427
No..

45:25.449 --> 45:27.717
I told Detectives at the time..

45:27.834 --> 45:29.700
And they told me
i shouldn't dwell on it.

45:29.744 --> 45:32.543
Detectives told you
that you shouldn't dwell on it?

45:32.572 --> 45:33.692
Yes sir.

45:33.812 --> 45:37.367
And i guess i put it out
of my mind and..

45:37.745 --> 45:40.835
When that neighbor lady said
she saw him too..

45:41.919 --> 45:45.125
I'm Christian, i try always to tell the truth
and i..

45:45.190 --> 45:47.778
I just felt i should tell you.

45:47.851 --> 45:49.902
I commend you
for your honesty.

45:50.223 --> 45:53.990
Something's that in short supply in my court room
as of late.

45:54.317 --> 45:58.549
At this point, Mr Barker,
given everything that we've heard..

45:58.600 --> 46:00.707
Wouldn't you say it's time
to discuss some relief?

46:00.758 --> 46:02.888
Your Honor, please.
I just need a few moments..

46:02.917 --> 46:05.426
We have had police detectives
lying under oath.

46:05.462 --> 46:08.207
Altering tapes, supressing evidence.

46:08.796 --> 46:11.079
And now, we have the victim's own mother.

46:11.116 --> 46:12.989
With no reason to lie.

46:13.010 --> 46:15.184
Telling us she saw
Mr. Berkhart..

46:15.206 --> 46:17.288
Fleeing the scene
of the crime.

46:17.884 --> 46:19.105
I repeat.

46:19.171 --> 46:21.105
At this point, Mr Barker.

46:21.170 --> 46:25.239
Don't you think Miss Stubbs is in title
of some relief?

46:27.617 --> 46:30.271
I can see how the woman is,
yes.

46:31.463 --> 46:33.428
You can make your decision
over the weekend.

46:33.449 --> 46:35.309
Whether you want to put on your own witnesses..

46:35.429 --> 46:37.568
And defense this case,
or not.

46:37.688 --> 46:42.510
In the meantime, i'm going to release Miss Stubbs
into some agreed upon custody.

46:42.964 --> 46:45.538
He's letting her go.
Don't you see?

46:45.632 --> 46:47.860
If i saw them, it means i got there
within minutes..

46:47.903 --> 46:50.346
It means i could have gotten there
when Jen could still speak.

46:50.375 --> 46:54.105
No, Mrs Cole. If you saw Mr Berkhart
leaving the crime scene.

46:54.127 --> 46:58.448
And told detectives, it means they withheld
excopultary evidence.

46:58.568 --> 46:59.573
Thank you.

46:59.693 --> 47:01.621
You may sit down.

47:02.428 --> 47:03.882
Let's go.

47:04.085 --> 47:05.656
Mrs McCall.

47:05.780 --> 47:07.197
Yes, Your Honor.

47:07.226 --> 47:09.371
You're the obvious choice
for custody.

47:09.414 --> 47:11.957
I have..

47:11.986 --> 47:13.600
I have plans to
see my daughter.

47:13.636 --> 47:15.527
I'm sure you'll work
something out.

47:25.314 --> 47:27.227
Welcome to my
perfect life.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.060
Because i want to see her.

47:32.835 --> 47:34.896
I don't have a car.

47:37.143 --> 47:39.303
Just forget it.

47:41.756 --> 47:43.436
Are you okay?

47:46.144 --> 47:48.801
I'm out for one weekend and..

47:48.815 --> 47:50.967
My parents won't bring her
to see me.

48:07.287 --> 48:10.152
She's so big,
i don't even recognize her.

48:10.272 --> 48:11.999
I miss you.

48:14.260 --> 48:16.681
They really gonna let her go?

48:16.801 --> 48:18.287
We'll know on Monday.

48:18.309 --> 48:22.650
But, it looks like things could finally go
Lacey's way.

48:24.948 --> 48:27.675
Things always go
Lacey's way.

48:27.762 --> 48:30.103
She makes sure of it.

48:36.636 --> 48:38.122
Yeah.

48:40.078 --> 48:41.692
I can't really talk right now.

48:51.478 --> 48:54.704
You just got through telling us
you didn't intend to defense this case.

48:54.726 --> 48:56.249
But to claim that she's innocent..

48:56.369 --> 48:58.317
I have never seen a case,
in any jurisdiction..

48:58.437 --> 49:01.329
Where there has been as much
prosecutorial misconduct.

49:01.373 --> 49:02.340
But my point..

49:02.362 --> 49:06.869
By my count, at least 5 state witnesses
perjured themselves.

49:06.962 --> 49:08.886
We have obstruction
of justice.

49:08.908 --> 49:11.866
Witness tampering,
evidence disappearing.

49:11.924 --> 49:14.120
There is a human being
sitting here.

49:14.149 --> 49:15.431
Serving a life sentence.

49:15.475 --> 49:19.023
Based on testimony that your office
has seen disavowed.

49:19.089 --> 49:21.763
I find by clear
and compelling evidence..

49:21.785 --> 49:25.795
Lacey Stubbs to be actually innocent
of first degree murder.

49:25.861 --> 49:28.260
So she shall be
immediately released.

49:28.289 --> 49:30.349
And i'm going to add..

49:30.640 --> 49:34.410
She can never be tried in this state again.

49:34.934 --> 49:36.192
No!

49:36.221 --> 49:38.318
Holy shit, we did it.

49:38.376 --> 49:40.201
Great, Cate.

49:40.594 --> 49:42.320
Congratulations.

49:42.342 --> 49:44.240
See you outside.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.031
Thank you.

49:56.598 --> 49:59.571
Icecream has
too much sugar.

50:00.015 --> 50:01.985
Today we're celebrating.

50:02.778 --> 50:03.784
Why?

50:03.827 --> 50:09.004
Because your momma helped a lady
out of a real bad situation.

50:09.033 --> 50:12.015
My daddy says she did bad things.

50:12.996 --> 50:15.735
People thought she did
bad things.

50:15.786 --> 50:18.826
Because mean people
told lies about her.

50:18.876 --> 50:21.973
So your mommy went to court
and told the truth.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.416
She made the mean people
play fair.

50:24.482 --> 50:26.415
You made the mean people play fair?

50:26.451 --> 50:27.665
Yeah, baby.

50:27.702 --> 50:31.554
Wow, i always knew you're good babe,
but you tore them up in there.

50:31.590 --> 50:33.430
How are you, George?
-Good.

50:33.750 --> 50:35.946
Looks like one of us
is going back to trial.

50:36.151 --> 50:37.481
I need you back on the team.

50:37.525 --> 50:39.510
I'm not sure
the other partners..

50:39.532 --> 50:41.600
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

50:41.644 --> 50:44.872
Even the stone cold killer
like Lacey Stubbs.

50:45.803 --> 50:47.329
How are you doing, buddy?

50:47.449 --> 50:49.161
I'm fine, buddy.

50:49.365 --> 50:50.812
Call me.

50:52.832 --> 50:54.671
Wow, babe..

50:54.700 --> 50:58.784
If you pay me a half a million bucks,
you can call me babe too, babe.

50:58.904 --> 51:02.027
Here's half a million dollars, babe.

51:03.694 --> 51:05.620
Don't encourage him.

51:06.478 --> 51:07.896
Can i brush his teeth?

51:07.933 --> 51:09.601
Not yet.
-He ate so much ice cream.

51:09.630 --> 51:10.873
Sshh..

51:10.993 --> 51:13.977
He's not the one that had ice cream.

51:15.557 --> 51:16.948
He had ice cream.

51:17.068 --> 51:18.286
Okay.

51:19.959 --> 51:21.934
I gotta go now, sweetypie.

51:22.312 --> 51:24.595
I'm gonna give you the
tiny little momma.

51:25.780 --> 51:26.987
Here.

51:28.565 --> 51:31.160
Take good care of it
while i'm gone.

51:41.490 --> 51:42.668
Hey.

51:44.849 --> 51:46.165
Stop.

51:46.653 --> 51:49.023
I need to talk to you
about Lacey Stubbs.

51:49.045 --> 51:51.321
I am not interested in
defending myself or the case.

51:51.336 --> 51:53.610
My daughter is Dorrie Booth.

51:55.035 --> 51:57.525
Do you think that there's any chance that the..

51:57.645 --> 51:59.789
New evidence you dug up
might help her too?

51:59.909 --> 52:01.787
I don't actually do
criminal defense.

52:01.823 --> 52:04.811
My daughter didn't kill anybody.

52:05.175 --> 52:08.417
But they put her in prison
for the rest of her natural life.

52:09.566 --> 52:11.582
What if it was your daughter?

52:13.538 --> 52:17.096
So, the cops basically came up with a story
that they wanted people to believe.

52:17.118 --> 52:18.987
And they sold it to the DA.

52:19.107 --> 52:21.300
And the DA sold it to the jury.

52:21.420 --> 52:22.922
And the jury bought it.

52:22.980 --> 52:24.211
Hook and sinker.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.087
Isn't that
what you did?

52:28.617 --> 52:32.083
I was under the impression that you wanted
to discuss an appeal?

52:32.203 --> 52:33.232
Why?

52:33.276 --> 52:34.384
Because..

52:34.406 --> 52:36.609
I'm gonna lie
to save myself.

52:37.081 --> 52:38.914
I did what they said i did.

52:39.205 --> 52:40.477
I held her down.

52:40.597 --> 52:42.667
While Lacey cut her throat.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.780
Lacey said that Rusty..
-Rusty wasn't there.

52:46.049 --> 52:48.156
He'd dropped us off
and he picked us up.

52:48.170 --> 52:50.010
But he was never
in the condo.

52:50.039 --> 52:51.651
So Lacey can lie..

52:51.771 --> 52:53.296
And say all kinds of things.

52:53.416 --> 52:57.260
And maybe you believe her when she bat her eyes
and turns on the water works.

52:57.303 --> 52:59.506
But that's because 
you weren't there.

52:59.688 --> 53:01.389
But i was.

53:01.469 --> 53:03.062
And i know what happened.

53:15.190 --> 53:17.117
Oh Jesus Christ.

53:37.576 --> 53:40.164
Step out of the car,
leave your hands where i can see them.

53:40.172 --> 53:41.386
You've got to be kidding.

53:41.728 --> 53:42.747
Is there a problem?

53:42.783 --> 53:44.724
I need you to step out
of the vehicle.

53:44.812 --> 53:46.477
Okay, you've had your fun.
I'm gonna go now.

53:46.491 --> 53:49.831
Lady, we haven't even begun to have fun yet.
Get out of the car.

53:50.747 --> 53:53.810
I said, get the fuck out of the car..

53:53.839 --> 53:55.111
Now.

54:02.653 --> 54:04.348
Face the car,
put your hands behind your back.

54:04.406 --> 54:05.795
I'm not doing any..

54:06.253 --> 54:07.816
I haven't done anything!

54:08.103 --> 54:10.884
I know, but i could say that i found an open container..

54:11.004 --> 54:12.336
In the front seat of your car.

54:12.456 --> 54:15.671
And in the court of law,
it'll be your word against mine, right?

54:19.081 --> 54:21.371
Add to that,
assaulting a police officer.

54:21.393 --> 54:22.799
Resisting arrest.

54:22.821 --> 54:24.355
You happen to know
a good lawyer, do you?

54:24.406 --> 54:25.616
This is bullshit.

54:25.652 --> 54:28.412
No, bullshit is Lacey Stubbs saying
i raped her.

54:28.532 --> 54:31.417
That's fucking bullshit.

54:33.866 --> 54:36.937
My client, Your Honor
is highly respected..

54:36.995 --> 54:40.305
Well-known attorney in this jurisdiction
for 13 years.

54:40.320 --> 54:43.396
She's charged with
assault on alleal.

54:43.417 --> 54:45.122
She thought her life was threaten.

54:45.151 --> 54:47.471
That won't fly in my court,
Counselor.

54:48.539 --> 54:52.634
January 26th, bind is set at
$5,000 unsecured.

54:53.734 --> 54:55.988
Let's go, Cate.

55:00.025 --> 55:02.075
I need to talk to Lacey.

55:02.432 --> 55:03.973
She ain't here.

55:03.995 --> 55:05.617
Do you have any idea
where i might find her?

55:05.654 --> 55:07.828
Took off a day
after the trial.

55:07.835 --> 55:09.631
Ain't heard from her since.

55:09.918 --> 55:11.612
That ain't true.

55:12.034 --> 55:13.143
She called.

55:13.263 --> 55:14.953
Asking for money.

55:15.073 --> 55:17.214
Do you know
where she was calling from?

55:17.334 --> 55:19.533
Number came up
in Stockton.

55:20.209 --> 55:22.126
She shacked up
with some guy.

55:22.177 --> 55:25.449
said she'd be sending somebody
to get her belongings, but..

55:25.499 --> 55:26.849
So far..

55:26.969 --> 55:29.162
No one.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.381
Lacey borrowed a necklace of mine.

55:35.570 --> 55:37.283
You don't got to explain.

55:37.326 --> 55:39.563
Lacey's been takin things that don't belong to her..

55:39.683 --> 55:42.138
Her whole life.

55:50.063 --> 55:51.801
Can i have a popsicle?
-No.

55:51.840 --> 55:54.196
Please, please.
-No.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.044
Got it.

56:28.900 --> 56:32.209
Do you happen to know the name
of the man she's staying with?

56:32.329 --> 56:34.483
I don't remember his name.

56:34.664 --> 56:37.522
He's one who was accused
of raping her.

56:37.864 --> 56:38.955
Detective Welch?

56:39.027 --> 56:40.969
No, not him.

56:41.089 --> 56:42.074
The other one.

56:42.103 --> 56:44.420
That prison guard
she was fucking.

56:44.540 --> 56:45.954
Thank you.

57:23.282 --> 57:24.947
Is Lacey here?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.999
What are you doing here?

57:35.429 --> 57:37.152
Make yourself at home.

57:41.410 --> 57:43.184
Is he the one
you accused of rape?

57:43.304 --> 57:44.391
I never accused him.

57:44.511 --> 57:46.279
They said i couldn't consent
cause i was an inmate.

57:46.399 --> 57:49.775
So they fired his ass
and bust me out to Fornfolk.

57:51.186 --> 57:52.836
I talked to Dorrie.

57:53.287 --> 57:55.063
Is she getting
a new trial too?

57:55.143 --> 57:55.981
No.

57:56.101 --> 57:57.966
She doesn't want one.

57:58.459 --> 58:00.394
Never was too bright, 
that girl.

58:00.452 --> 58:03.055
She still says
you killed Jen.

58:05.028 --> 58:07.194
Dorrie wants to be all sweet
and Jesus now.

58:07.216 --> 58:08.944
But do you know how she killed a girl
back in Alaska..

58:08.981 --> 58:11.318
Who's gonna tell her parents
she was a lesbo?

58:11.359 --> 58:15.031
Yeah, put a rope around her neck, strung her out,
and dumpr her body in a frozen lake.

58:15.082 --> 58:16.485
Her parents won't let you in..

58:16.605 --> 58:18.647
And the cops wouldn't catch her.

58:18.767 --> 58:20.861
I found this at your parents' house.

58:21.846 --> 58:23.299
I read a lot of trash when i was in jail.

58:23.334 --> 58:25.352
What else you gonna do, right?

58:26.377 --> 58:28.798
You mind reading this section?

58:31.198 --> 58:32.797
Okay, i'll read it.

58:33.234 --> 58:35.669
I could feel the gun
against my throat.

58:36.091 --> 58:37.802
Then he moved it
down between my legs..

58:37.839 --> 58:40.776
And i could feel the cold steel
slide inside my cunt.

58:40.820 --> 58:42.589
The cop was fucking me with his piece..

58:42.609 --> 58:45.411
As his cock tore me open
from behind.

58:46.468 --> 58:48.523
You said that
after Welch raped you..

58:48.566 --> 58:50.580
He threaten to do the same
to your kid.

58:50.711 --> 58:52.174
You didn't have a kid yet.

58:52.211 --> 58:54.530
You were still 6 months pregnant
when you went to jail.

58:54.552 --> 58:57.024
He might not have said that thing
about the kid right then.

58:57.061 --> 58:58.522
Welch didn't rape you, did he?

58:58.580 --> 59:00.820
I knew he was a cop, friend of Rusty's.

59:01.045 --> 59:02.863
What about the initials
on the gun?

59:03.138 --> 59:04.250
I made that part up too..

59:04.294 --> 59:05.657
But everything else it true.

59:05.777 --> 59:09.048
I swear on my daughter's life.

59:10.210 --> 59:12.151
Who the fuck are you
to judge me?

59:12.166 --> 59:15.259
You try walking a mile on my shoes
and see how pretty the world looks.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.157
What would i see, Lacey?

59:17.455 --> 59:20.650
Jen Cole's terrified face
as i cut her throat?

59:22.322 --> 59:23.820
The judge said i'm innocent.

59:25.917 --> 59:27.792
But you're not, are you?

59:30.065 --> 59:31.345
What do you think?

59:32.552 --> 59:33.711
Welch is dirty.

59:33.754 --> 59:34.823
Brinkerhoff's negligent.

59:34.845 --> 59:36.801
Rusty's a creep
and she's guilty.

59:36.921 --> 59:38.890
Jesus Christ, i did what i accuse them of.

59:38.926 --> 59:41.340
It's not the same thing, Cate.
You know it.

59:41.362 --> 59:43.274
We won the case,
based on a lie.

59:43.303 --> 59:45.223
Forget about Lacey Stubbs.

59:45.281 --> 59:47.957
Focus on your custody hearing.

59:48.204 --> 59:49.370
You did your job.

59:49.490 --> 59:50.823
You did it well.

59:50.943 --> 59:52.783
Now move on.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:03.859
Thanks.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.228
Fern, i'll see you up there.

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:20.099
When you sat on the bench as long as i have,
you'd get use to the fact..

01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:23.475
The trial just basically
a liar's contest.

01:00:23.518 --> 01:00:26.187
The point is, we set a clear message
to law enforcement.

01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:27.845
But she's guilty.

01:00:30.222 --> 01:00:32.084
I heard about
your assault charge.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.851
It's all bullshit.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.836
Who's the judge?

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:39.297
Hayes.

01:00:39.988 --> 01:00:41.536
I'll see what i can do.

01:00:42.089 --> 01:00:43.449
What do you mean?

01:00:43.919 --> 01:00:45.693
I'll talk to him.

01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:49.513
Are you free tonight?

01:00:50.123 --> 01:00:52.566
The Reinassance,
say 8.30?

01:00:52.937 --> 01:00:56.777
My grandfather used to take me
to the Reinassance.

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.805
For lobster.

01:00:59.052 --> 01:01:01.956
In that case,
let's make it to Huttington.

01:01:05.068 --> 01:01:06.752
You're a good lawyer, Cate.

01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:09.093
You can even be a great one.

01:01:09.507 --> 01:01:11.725
Don't let a thing like this
get in the way.

01:01:15.957 --> 01:01:19.563
Dr Wise has submitted a report
which i have reviewed..

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:23.402
It's her opinion that, while the mother loves
and cares deeply for her child..

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:27.198
She's not able at present to
fully focus on the child's needs.

01:01:27.249 --> 01:01:30.862
Seems the father has been a loving stable force
of his daughter's life.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:33.784
We certainly don't want to deny
the child's access to that stability.

01:01:33.817 --> 01:01:35.956
Because the father's compelled
to move for employment.

01:01:35.978 --> 01:01:37.948
Your Honor..
-I'm not finished.

01:01:38.312 --> 01:01:40.027
You're going to work
for Microsoft.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.409
Yes.

01:01:41.893 --> 01:01:46.568
I don't see that the child's rights or welfare
will be prejudiced in this case.

01:01:46.597 --> 01:01:48.546
Your Honor, she's 5 years old.

01:01:48.735 --> 01:01:53.173
I may not be the perfect mother,
but i love my daughter more than anything in the world.

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:56.663
Well, looks like you're going to get the chance to prove it.

01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:00.482
I'll call you, okay?
-Yeah.

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.738
Microsoft.

01:02:10.348 --> 01:02:12.559
I should have sued you for alimony.

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:15.258
I'm not asking you
for anything, Cate.

01:02:15.272 --> 01:02:17.148
No, just my daughter.

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:18.952
What's the difference, Cate?

01:02:19.461 --> 01:02:21.146
You're already right back in the saddle.

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:22.817
You've got your high profile cases.

01:02:22.937 --> 01:02:24.569
Same old firm,
crazy hours.

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:27.072
Listen, i worked my ass off
on that case..

01:02:27.094 --> 01:02:30.353
So i can prove to you, and the judge
and everybody else..

01:02:30.382 --> 01:02:32.345
That i was capable
of being my daughter's mother..

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.708
You work your ass off
because you like to win.

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:38.049
Augie doesn't need a mother
who wins.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.483
She needs a mother who's there.

01:02:39.519 --> 01:02:42.610
Then why are you taking her
a thousand miles away?

01:02:43.078 --> 01:02:44.241
I tell you what.

01:02:44.976 --> 01:02:48.081
Move to Seattle for Augie.
I'll share custody.

01:02:48.433 --> 01:02:50.178
I can't move to Seattle, Josh!

01:02:50.192 --> 01:02:52.919
I practice law
in California!

01:02:56.045 --> 01:02:57.419
We're..

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.980
We're leaving in the morning, early.

01:03:00.453 --> 01:03:01.878
Maybe you could..

01:03:01.998 --> 01:03:04.270
Manage to stop by
and say goodbye.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.267
Just try and focus
on the next right action.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:13.684
Like what?

01:03:13.939 --> 01:03:15.522
Throwing myself off of
the Sixth Street Bridge?

01:03:15.565 --> 01:03:18.212
You gotta count the bad blow.
-Thank you.

01:03:18.517 --> 01:03:20.350
I want a fucking drink.

01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:23.596
Your feelings, Cate..

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:25.154
They come and go.

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:26.900
You don't know shit
about my feelings.

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:28.550
I know you drink.

01:03:28.586 --> 01:03:30.590
So you don't have to feel them.

01:03:30.626 --> 01:03:31.870
Give me a break.

01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:33.753
I've been where you are.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.772
It gets better.

01:03:35.838 --> 01:03:36.936
Does it?

01:03:37.056 --> 01:03:38.375
You live in your office..

01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:39.942
WIth a cod and a hot plate.

01:03:40.062 --> 01:03:41.797
You didn't just lose
your kid.

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:45.069
Do you want to play
some kind of misery contest?

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.374
With me?

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:48.388
Alright, let's play Cate.

01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:50.075
That'd be fun.

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:52.185
But i'm gonna tell you one thing,
goddmanit..

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.250
You will lose, you'll fucking lose completely.

01:03:56.938 --> 01:03:59.658
So please, just cut out the bullshit.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:01.853
I can't do this anymore.

01:04:01.919 --> 01:04:03.795
No, you can't do this anymore.

01:04:03.817 --> 01:04:05.249
No, you won't.

01:04:05.271 --> 01:04:06.820
What do you want to be?

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.256
An old bag, with a bottle of booze
beside you?

01:04:09.376 --> 01:04:13.109
I have heard enough AA bullshit
to last me a life time.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.614
All the cute little sayings,
and the stupid rules.

01:04:16.708 --> 01:04:18.687
It doesn't fucking work.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.287
I'm fucking done
with all of it.

01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:21.399
Cate, sit down.

01:04:21.428 --> 01:04:24.114
The A losers
and the dirty cops..

01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:26.564
And the defendants lying off their asses..

01:04:26.684 --> 01:04:28.301
Go and fuck yourselves.

01:04:28.315 --> 01:04:30.729
I'll fuck myself, sit down.

01:04:30.969 --> 01:04:33.547
I put a man in prison
for 11 years..

01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:35.532
Because i followed the rules.

01:04:35.888 --> 01:04:38.302
I just let a murdered walks
because i followed the rules.

01:04:38.339 --> 01:04:40.782
And now i lost my kid because i followed the rules,
you know what?

01:04:40.825 --> 01:04:42.389
Fuck the rules!

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.360
Fuck you and fuck the fucking rules!

01:04:48.482 --> 01:04:50.365
Ow shit.

01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:04.300
I'm meeting Jameson Sumnter.

01:05:04.344 --> 01:05:05.733
Are you Cate?

01:05:05.853 --> 01:05:06.976
Yeah.

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.019
Thanks.

01:05:33.253 --> 01:05:36.513
I wanted to say i'm sorry.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.414
I spent a life saving..

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:43.729
Fighting those awful charges.

01:05:44.689 --> 01:05:46.717
But if you love someone..

01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:49.088
You have no choice.

01:05:49.768 --> 01:05:52.633
But to hold on
to what you believe about.

01:05:53.302 --> 01:05:56.692
Even when people say
terrible things..

01:05:58.248 --> 01:06:00.629
You can't go with the evidence.

01:06:01.341 --> 01:06:03.348
You gotta go
with your heart.

01:06:12.186 --> 01:06:14.556
I really wasn't trying
to hurt you.

01:06:15.785 --> 01:06:17.455
I thought..

01:06:17.898 --> 01:06:19.971
I trully thought.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.651
I was doing something good.

01:06:29.946 --> 01:06:32.011
A guy i know.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.907
Did 27 years for something
he didn't do.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.747
He said you can hang on to the hate.

01:06:40.573 --> 01:06:42.877
All these years,
i thought..

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:46.882
I thought i wanted to hear
you say you're sorry.

01:06:49.177 --> 01:06:51.082
But this is better.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:56.244
I like watching you cry.

01:06:58.994 --> 01:07:00.674
You know why?

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.375
The hate is all
you left me with.

01:07:07.318 --> 01:07:09.325
Hate is all i got.

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:51.809
Shit..

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:03.649
Sorry baby, i totally overslept.

01:08:06.264 --> 01:08:08.205
Hey..
-Hey.

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:12.475
I'm gonna give you
the tiny little momma.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.506
Daddy..
-I know you're mad at me.

01:08:17.015 --> 01:08:18.486
I know you are.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.817
It's okay, baby.

01:08:19.861 --> 01:08:22.332
No matter what anybody says, i..

01:08:22.604 --> 01:08:23.607
Love you.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.709
Alright that's it.
-More than anything in the world.

01:08:25.745 --> 01:08:28.192
And i always will.

01:08:29.426 --> 01:08:33.250
When people say really bad things
about a person..

01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:35.569
If you love them..

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.408
You have to hang on.

01:08:37.424 --> 01:08:40.055
Do what you believe about them
in your heart.

01:08:40.165 --> 01:08:42.173
You can't just go on evidence.

01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:44.913
Cause evidence get
misrepresented.

01:08:44.935 --> 01:08:48.756
And twisted until it's all
a fucking lie.

01:08:48.807 --> 01:08:50.072
That's it.

01:08:50.345 --> 01:08:51.792
You need to get
yourself some help.

01:08:51.821 --> 01:08:53.952
I got help!

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.653
This is the new improved me.

01:09:15.295 --> 01:09:16.720
I slept.

01:09:17.755 --> 01:09:19.682
So i see.

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.502
I got a call from the DA.

01:09:29.895 --> 01:09:32.229
The assault charges are dropped.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:34.920
I see.

01:09:35.763 --> 01:09:39.281
I actually am the piece of shit
of the center of the universe.

01:09:39.448 --> 01:09:42.161
You're half way right anyway.

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:47.127
You want to keep feeling the way
you're feeling right now.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:50.550
Well, just keep on doing
what you're doing.

01:09:51.307 --> 01:09:53.313
If you want to feel better..

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:57.700
Figure out how you can serve something other
than your own ego.

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:02.323
So you made a mistake.

01:10:02.352 --> 01:10:03.581
I didn't make a mistake.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:05.423
So Lacey pulled one over
on you.

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:09.490
The custody judge thought Josh was a better parent, okay.

01:10:10.312 --> 01:10:12.120
What are you gonna do about it?

01:10:12.134 --> 01:10:13.712
You're gonna drink yourself
to death?

01:10:13.734 --> 01:10:15.482
So Augie has no mother at all?

01:10:15.496 --> 01:10:17.387
For god sake, i had a few drinks.

01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:18.662
Oh save it, Cate.

01:10:18.698 --> 01:10:23.037
Save it for somebody that can't smell your bullshit from mile away.

01:10:23.081 --> 01:10:24.397
You're a drunk.

01:10:24.412 --> 01:10:27.015
And not because the world
did it to you.

01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:29.712
Or because Wilson George turned out
to be innocent.

01:10:29.748 --> 01:10:32.126
Or Lacey turned out to be guilty.

01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:36.637
You're a drunk because it's the way
you choose to handle it.

01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:40.151
And if you don't change.

01:10:40.347 --> 01:10:41.787
Guess what?

01:10:42.056 --> 01:10:44.258
Nothing changes.

01:10:54.982 --> 01:10:58.632
You're a great and special person, Cate.

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:01.579
But not for any of the reasons
you think.

01:11:01.768 --> 01:11:04.058
Not because you're a great lawyer.

01:11:04.313 --> 01:11:05.816
Or you're pretty.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.680
Or because you win in court.

01:11:13.844 --> 01:11:15.545
What's so great about me?

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.968
It's something you need to
figure out for yourself.

01:12:37.108 --> 01:12:38.417
I need 5 minutes.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.515
We're appealing Stubbs.

01:12:39.544 --> 01:12:41.078
Everybody knows
you're appealing.

01:12:41.143 --> 01:12:43.411
I know how you can put her
back in jail.

01:12:45.497 --> 01:12:48.354
Our case can be made that she feels to exhaust your state's appeal.

01:12:54.294 --> 01:12:56.127
I can have you disbarred.

01:12:56.447 --> 01:12:59.642
If you have me disbarred, you can't take credit
for my idea.

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:10.233
Can i talk to you?

01:13:10.247 --> 01:13:11.396
Go fuck yourself.

01:13:11.476 --> 01:13:13.636
I know she lied about the rape.

01:13:13.985 --> 01:13:16.020
I didn't know it then,
but i know it now.

01:13:16.361 --> 01:13:17.939
You know your problem is?

01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:20.038
You can't tell the good guys
from the bad guys.

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:22.706
Used to be a lot easier
to tell the difference.

01:13:23.019 --> 01:13:24.451
You're no better than me.

01:13:24.531 --> 01:13:26.425
I don't think i'm better than you.

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:28.264
I think i'm just like you.

01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:32.177
I want to get the bad guys too,
and right now i don't care how i do it.

01:13:33.864 --> 01:13:35.452
They found a technicality.

01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.615
They're expoliting it.

01:13:36.637 --> 01:13:38.935
Maybe you didn't notice,
but i'm back in jail.

01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:42.074
As soon as the state denies the appeal
we go right back to federal court.

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:44.798
Sumnter's all over the news saying
he'll set you free again.

01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:48.506
Why would you want to represent
someone you think is guilty?

01:13:50.975 --> 01:13:52.887
I don't make mistakes.

01:13:53.483 --> 01:13:55.301
This case will come around again.

01:13:55.707 --> 01:13:57.169
And when it does..

01:13:57.285 --> 01:14:00.390
I intend to see that this poor abused woman
is set free.

01:14:00.426 --> 01:14:01.891
Once and for all.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.898
Douglas is moving over
to Exxon.

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:06.563
I want you with me in DC
quarterbacking Waterford.

01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:08.730
That's fucking fantastic.

01:14:08.759 --> 01:14:10.141
We'll head out tonight.

01:14:10.243 --> 01:14:11.950
Oh, i'm..

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:14.044
I'm with my daughter in Seattle this weekend.

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:16.029
Sorry babe, you're in DC.

01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:18.879
Play your cards right,
and you're right back on the fast track.

01:14:25.442 --> 01:14:26.601
Then we'll put on Henkle..

01:14:26.644 --> 01:14:29.240
Said DBCP was well below
the damage causing level.

01:14:29.279 --> 01:14:32.161
And that workers refused to wear
protective gear. Sorry.

01:14:32.554 --> 01:14:35.231
Hey, i'm gonna miss my connection
to Seattle.

01:14:35.289 --> 01:14:37.194
Can you see if there's any later flights?

01:14:38.117 --> 01:14:41.342
Everything you want to know
about Arthuro Juan Gonzales.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:45.050
That's not the same guy.

01:14:46.676 --> 01:14:48.021
Isn't it?

01:14:53.485 --> 01:14:55.688
Okay, so check another airline.

01:15:09.856 --> 01:15:11.601
A cellphone?

01:15:13.283 --> 01:15:16.256
I've entered myself remember?

01:15:16.569 --> 01:15:18.450
So if you ever need to talk to me..

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:20.595
You just press that.

01:15:24.555 --> 01:15:26.736
And that way i'll always know it's you.

01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:28.930
Hello?

01:15:39.021 --> 01:15:40.813
Okay bug, we gotta go back to bed.

01:15:40.864 --> 01:15:42.522
Could you give us a minute?

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.860
I'm sorry i missed your party.

01:16:00.628 --> 01:16:02.620
I really wanted to be there.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:07.318
I know i let you down,
and i'm really really sorry.

01:16:09.216 --> 01:16:11.535
Blue dog doesn't feel good.

01:16:11.655 --> 01:16:12.641
No?

01:16:12.761 --> 01:16:14.248
Is he sick?

01:16:15.157 --> 01:16:17.542
He ate too many cupcakes.

01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:26.774
I'm not gonna make you
any more promises.

01:16:27.967 --> 01:16:29.690
I'm just gonna do better.

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:31.064
Okay?

01:16:38.012 --> 01:16:41.114
I don't want the tiny momma anymore.

01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:02.426
Make this go away, you'll make full partner
by the end of the year.

01:17:02.463 --> 01:17:04.237
You have my word.

01:17:05.434 --> 01:17:07.208
Shall we?

01:17:08.822 --> 01:17:12.667
Mr Gonzales, would you mind reading the first paragraph
of this article?

01:17:29.232 --> 01:17:31.344
Arthuro Juan Gonzales
convicted of a brutal crime..

01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:33.505
In Chapas Mexico, in 2003.

01:17:35.309 --> 01:17:36.379
This isn't me.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.191
Mr Gonzales, i'm looking
at your rep sheet.

01:17:39.899 --> 01:17:40.922
The lists..

01:17:40.973 --> 01:17:41.881
Murder.

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.943
Kidnapping.

01:17:42.987 --> 01:17:43.845
Assault.

01:17:49.214 --> 01:17:50.428
Sorry.

01:17:59.436 --> 01:18:00.629
Cate.

01:18:02.368 --> 01:18:04.106
Mrs McCall.

01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:18.036
I know you didn't kill anybody.

01:18:23.302 --> 01:18:24.675
We're just trying to make him
look bad.

01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:26.187
So that you won't give him
what he deserves.

01:18:26.224 --> 01:18:28.180
Your Honor, we need a recess.

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:33.712
Just give him what he deserves.

01:18:48.592 --> 01:18:50.562
Nice piece and the Times.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:54.573
Sure it's justice you want?

01:18:54.595 --> 01:18:56.704
Not a sit on the court?

01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.107
What are you worried about, Cate?

01:19:00.689 --> 01:19:02.473
That your client will go free?

01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:04.923
You can't sit on this case.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.838
You need to recuse yourself.

01:19:12.278 --> 01:19:13.994
All rise.

01:19:19.508 --> 01:19:20.948
Who is that?

01:19:21.939 --> 01:19:24.091
Looks like Justice Tanaka.

01:19:24.353 --> 01:19:25.822
Please be seated.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:29.851
Before us today,
after a lengthy journey.

01:19:29.873 --> 01:19:32.631
Up and down the states
and federal justice system..

01:19:32.682 --> 01:19:35.154
We have a Habeas Petition
of Lacey Stubbs.

01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:37.317
I'd like to give both parties
an opportunity to..

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.840
Request additional testimony..

01:19:39.884 --> 01:19:42.823
On topics that the court has not sufficiently addressed.

01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:44.386
Where the fuck is Sumnter?

01:19:44.517 --> 01:19:46.919
Did you ever socialize with
Lacey Stubbs?

01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:48.046
No sir.

01:19:48.097 --> 01:19:50.051
Did you have sex with Lacey Stubbs?

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.244
No sir, i did not.

01:19:51.273 --> 01:19:53.367
Did you rape Lacey Stubbs?

01:19:53.432 --> 01:19:55.017
Absolutely not.

01:19:55.266 --> 01:19:58.647
Do you know where you were on
November 29th, 2007?

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:02.051
Yes, i was in Chicago
with my wife and son.

01:20:02.254 --> 01:20:04.036
So now you say you're in Chicago?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.094
November 29th, 2007?

01:20:06.214 --> 01:20:07.411
Yes, that's correct.

01:20:07.601 --> 01:20:09.775
And we're supposed to take
your word for that?

01:20:09.821 --> 01:20:11.784
You could,
or you could..

01:20:11.828 --> 01:20:13.980
Check my credit card receipt.

01:20:14.315 --> 01:20:17.591
So it's still your testimony
that Detective Welch raped you?

01:20:17.656 --> 01:20:19.242
She said i wouldn't have to
go through this again.

01:20:19.271 --> 01:20:20.920
Answer the question.

01:20:21.989 --> 01:20:23.290
Yes, he raped me.

01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:25.275
Reading from the record now..

01:20:25.326 --> 01:20:26.783
Welch got off me..

01:20:26.834 --> 01:20:29.197
And said if i open my mouth..

01:20:29.517 --> 01:20:32.688
They'd come back and do the same
to my kid.

01:20:32.943 --> 01:20:34.426
That's still
your testimony?

01:20:34.492 --> 01:20:35.270
Yes.

01:20:35.284 --> 01:20:38.474
But on November 29th, 2007..

01:20:38.569 --> 01:20:40.488
You didn't have a child, did you?

01:20:40.608 --> 01:20:41.229
He said..

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.090
It's a simple yes or no question.

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.594
He said he was gonna rape my kid.

01:20:46.645 --> 01:20:47.837
Maybe he meant the one
inside of me.

01:20:47.888 --> 01:20:49.750
I don't know
what he was thinking.

01:20:52.002 --> 01:20:54.743
Your Honor, i'd like to mark
this State 12.

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.590
Do you recognize this book?

01:21:01.829 --> 01:21:03.179
Not really.

01:21:07.353 --> 01:21:10.894
Would you mind reading
the underline passage here?

01:21:11.112 --> 01:21:14.764
Starting with
"I could feel the gun against my throat".

01:21:14.807 --> 01:21:15.949
She's trying to fuck me!

01:21:15.978 --> 01:21:16.720
Miss Dubbs.

01:21:16.742 --> 01:21:19.377
That cocksucker got him that
in the first place.

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:21.067
You fucking bitch!

01:21:21.096 --> 01:21:22.608
I'm gonna kill you!

01:21:22.652 --> 01:21:24.331
Get the fuck..

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:26.632
I'm gonna fucking slice your throat!

01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:28.319
I'll kill you!

01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:29.519
I'll cut you!

01:21:29.555 --> 01:21:30.685
Court order!

01:21:30.714 --> 01:21:32.430
Clear the room!

01:21:32.481 --> 01:21:34.357
I'll fucking kill you!

01:21:34.378 --> 01:21:35.401
Hurry!

01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:37.960
I'll kill you!

01:21:57.154 --> 01:22:00.128
One of my sponsors' favorite saying is..

01:22:00.848 --> 01:22:02.981
You can't change the wind.

01:22:03.068 --> 01:22:05.395
But you can adjust the sail.

01:22:06.334 --> 01:22:08.603
It's been a pretty rough year recently.

01:22:09.068 --> 01:22:10.231
Somedays it's..

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.565
All i can do to..

01:22:11.616 --> 01:22:13.412
Hang on and hold my head up high.

01:22:13.426 --> 01:22:16.465
So i can see the damn sails
without getting my head knocked off, but..

01:22:17.762 --> 01:22:19.144
I'm here.

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.816
Again.

01:22:21.718 --> 01:22:23.108
Still.

01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:28.453
Graditute's always been really hard.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:32.285
But i want to say thanks.

01:22:36.268 --> 01:22:38.326
I wouldn't be here without you.

01:22:44.855 --> 01:22:47.349
Call me, as soon as you land.

01:22:47.469 --> 01:22:48.650
Yeah.

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:52.268
And, don't forget
you'll start over.

01:22:52.312 --> 01:22:53.751
Every single day.

01:22:53.824 --> 01:22:55.481
One fucking day
at a time.

01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:56.455
Yeah..

01:22:58.378 --> 01:22:59.912
Okay..

01:23:02.512 --> 01:23:04.192
You're an asshole.

01:23:05.661 --> 01:23:07.366
Did you figure it out yet?

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:10.979
The great and the special?

01:23:11.394 --> 01:23:12.870
I'm still working on it.

01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:13.946
Oh.

01:23:14.164 --> 01:23:15.793
Maybe that's it.
Maybe..

01:23:15.873 --> 01:23:17.757
I never give up.

01:23:18.463 --> 01:23:20.266
That's not nothing.

01:23:56.017 --> 01:23:57.762
Is this my room?

01:23:57.842 --> 01:23:59.143
Yeah.

01:24:00.199 --> 01:24:02.482
I have a rainbow room
in daddy's house.

01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:04.976
Well, now you have one at
my house too.

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:08.852
A fish.

01:24:09.392 --> 01:24:11.283
Hi boy.

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:14.620
I'm gonna name you
Rainbow.

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.920
Is that okay?
