Oh! Wray Nerely, everyone!

01:20.209 --> 01:22.584
Woo!
( clapping )

01:22.626 --> 01:25.584
Bobbie. Bobbie, Bobbie, Bobbie.

01:25.626 --> 01:28.083
Stop it. God damn it.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.250
What are you doing here?

01:29.292 --> 01:31.083
I'm here for you, Wray.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.959
I manage with a personal touch.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.167
That's why I have so many
restraining orders against me.

01:37.209 --> 01:39.459
Why do you look like
the "Hispanna Vanna White"?

01:39.501 --> 01:42.459
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment, sir.

01:42.501 --> 01:46.334
I'm here to impress
Diego Alfonso, el director.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.167
He needs to see me as an ex-dancer
for "Doctor Cop Lawyer."

01:49.209 --> 01:51.250
No, look, if you represent me

01:51.292 --> 01:53.584
you should be trying to get me,
"Doctor Cop Lawyer."

01:55.292 --> 01:58.000
I am an ex-dancer, Wray.

01:58.042 --> 01:59.292
I performed in, "Swan Lake."

01:59.334 --> 02:02.292
I took on the role of both
the White Swan and the Black Swan.

02:02.334 --> 02:07.292
And also in '76 I was in an adult movie
called "Schwanz Lake"

02:07.334 --> 02:10.501
where I took on the white schwanz
and the black schwanz.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.501
( mumbling )

02:12.542 --> 02:13.584
- Got it.
- Fine.

02:13.626 --> 02:14.626
N-n-no thank you.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.417
All right look, why don't you squint.

02:17.459 --> 02:18.667
What? Why would I do that?

02:18.709 --> 02:21.000
Squint, because it will make
you look more manly.

02:21.042 --> 02:22.918
- Oh!
- You know, like a mean man.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.167
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, squint, okay, good.

02:24.209 --> 02:27.083
Got it, you got it.
Okay, now talk like...

02:27.125 --> 02:29.042
- Why-Why would I do that?
- It's manly.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.459
You have a very high,
little girl's voice.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.501
Oh, yes, yes. Okay.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.918
Talk like this.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.000
- Mmm.
- Okay I got it.

02:34.042 --> 02:36.542
All right, look, relax.
He's coming, let's just act casual.

02:36.584 --> 02:39.083
Hello there!

02:39.125 --> 02:40.459
( clapping )

02:40.501 --> 02:44.417
Listen to me, I don't care
if the courthouse is in the hospital

02:44.459 --> 02:45.792
or the hospital is in the courthouse

02:45.834 --> 02:47.792
as long as they're both
in the police station.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.083
Entiendes? Gracias. Se bye.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.375
I am Diego.

02:52.417 --> 02:53.834
- Are you Wray?
- I am Wray Nerely.

02:53.876 --> 02:55.751
It's very good to meet--
( coughs )

02:55.792 --> 02:58.501
This doesn't-- I'm-- Hi I'm, yes.

02:58.542 --> 03:02.334
Hello, SeГѓВ±or Diego.

03:02.375 --> 03:07.167
This is the one and only,
Wray Nerely.

03:07.209 --> 03:09.250
And, I am Bobbie.

03:09.292 --> 03:12.250
That's spelled with two B's
that rhyme with booby.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.292
- God, no.
- Woo.

03:13.334 --> 03:15.459
That is not...

03:15.501 --> 03:19.542
All right, well I'm just going to find
a ballet bar so I can limber up my squats.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.125
( snapping )

03:25.584 --> 03:28.083
I love your grandmother, Wray.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.918
- She is so full of...
- Shit.

03:29.959 --> 03:30.959
- Life
- Life.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.334
She reminds me of, um,
how you say, cГѓВіmo se dice--

03:34.375 --> 03:37.751
There is no word for this in English.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.000
The village bicycle.

03:39.042 --> 03:41.125
- Ahh.
- It belongs to no one,

03:41.167 --> 03:43.000
but everyone rides it

03:43.042 --> 03:46.292
and on hot days
you will get a rash.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.709
That's my Nana.

03:48.751 --> 03:50.459
Wray, thank you.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.000
- Thank you for being here.
- You're welcome.

03:52.042 --> 03:56.626
Now, the clients were hoping
for someone else.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.667
They're over there,
wave to them.

03:58.709 --> 03:59.709
Stop waving.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.375
Their anger grows deeper.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.125
- Wray.
- Yes?

04:05.167 --> 04:07.334
Jack has told me many
great things about you .

04:07.375 --> 04:09.375
Okay, Jack is
a really good friend of mine.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.083
You know, and actually he told me
a little something about you

04:11.125 --> 04:14.417
that you are doing a project called,
"Doctor Cop Lawyer" next,

04:14.459 --> 04:18.541
and that you still have not
found your leading man.

04:18.584 --> 04:23.209
- SГѓВ­, Dr. Officer Blade Slater, Esquire.
- I can play him.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.334
( laughs )

04:26.459 --> 04:28.918
Wray, no, no, no, no.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.959
That part
is not right for you, at all.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That part has to be played
by a manly man.

04:33.042 --> 04:34.918
Well, I can be manly.

04:34.959 --> 04:39.501
Wray, he must be such a manly man,

04:39.542 --> 04:42.959
that there is another man
inside of him.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.792
No, not--
Shouldn't sound like that.

04:46.834 --> 04:50.292
Like a "Russian nesting doll" man.

04:50.334 --> 04:53.042
Like a man inside of another man,

04:53.083 --> 04:56.626
inside of another man,
inside of another man.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.501
Nope, no, no, no.

05:00.459 --> 05:04.751
Like, it's as if he has
swallowed many men.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.375
( coughs )

05:06.417 --> 05:07.876
That's it.
That's it.

05:07.918 --> 05:09.417
( buzzing )

05:09.459 --> 05:11.542
Oh, sorry--
I have to take this call.

05:11.584 --> 05:13.167
- We'll talk, okay?
- Okay.

05:13.209 --> 05:14.834
Hola.

05:14.876 --> 05:15.876
We'll talk later.

05:15.918 --> 05:18.209
Randy.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.250
Pleased to meet you, Wray.
Big fan of "Spectrum."

05:21.292 --> 05:23.918
- Thanks.
- I'm Randy Lane, the stunt coordinator.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.125
I'll be doing your stunts for you.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.167
Stunts?

05:26.209 --> 05:30.959
Don't worry. My only rule is
I won't ask you to do anything

05:31.000 --> 05:35.167
that I wouldn't ask the most special fella
in my life to do, my nine year old, Clyde.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.918
Well, I think I can do a little bit more
than nine year old, Clyde.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.959
( laughs )

05:44.584 --> 05:45.584
Safety meeting, everyone.

05:48.042 --> 05:49.292
Safety meeting, ugh.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.250
Let's go people. Let's fall in.
Safety meeting.

05:53.292 --> 05:56.125
Come on, everybody.

05:56.167 --> 05:59.501
( grunts )

05:59.542 --> 06:01.042
Great to see you all.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.167
Julie, I love the new haircut.

06:03.209 --> 06:06.584
Seriously, though, we are here
to have fun and to be safe.

06:06.626 --> 06:09.542
Now, I'll take care of the safe
and y'all take care of the fun.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.334
Stunts are dangerous.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.667
They can be painful.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.584
I wanna stop you right there.
Just, yeah, they can be painful.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.042
Some people experience pain
differently than others.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.834
I've been hurt on set.
I've been hurt bad.

06:20.876 --> 06:24.334
But, I persevered, I got through it.

06:24.375 --> 06:27.167
I have lived to tell the tale.

06:27.209 --> 06:29.250
Geez, what happened, bud?

06:30.375 --> 06:32.125
I don't like to talk about it.

06:32.167 --> 06:35.167
Please, Wray, tell your tale.
We are all your family.

06:35.209 --> 06:37.792
Okay, well, I don't know.

06:37.834 --> 06:41.334
Can you see that scar right there?

06:41.375 --> 06:42.709
There?

06:42.751 --> 06:44.626
No, I think that's mascara.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.876
Right there,
see that was a deep cut.

06:46.918 --> 06:49.918
Deep, deep, deep, deep--
ow I was hitting it.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.501
Uh deep, cut. It bled a lot.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.375
And then, I passed out.
Cut my head.

06:54.417 --> 06:59.000
And, that's where I got a stitch
and now I have a cowlick.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.375
( laughs )

07:02.417 --> 07:04.042
Wray, you're so funny.
He's joking.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.792
Wray.
Good one Wray.

07:08.792 --> 07:12.709
In seriousness, though,
injuries do happen.

07:12.751 --> 07:16.083
I got this one doubling LeVar Burton
on a "Reading Rainbow."

07:16.125 --> 07:18.209
Whoa. My God!

07:18.250 --> 07:19.792
- Ay dios mio.
- What are we lookin' at?

07:19.834 --> 07:21.959
I can see you digesting.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.876
Please, I got worse.

07:23.918 --> 07:24.918
Wait until you see this.

07:24.959 --> 07:27.334
Bobbie, don't do--
Put it away. Put it away.

07:27.375 --> 07:31.000
So, safety first, folks.
Safety first.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.751
Yes I will.

07:35.709 --> 07:39.167
- Can you...
- Wray, let's talk about this part.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.501
- Okay.
- Okay, you are a brave astronaut.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.584
You are in space.

07:44.626 --> 07:47.959
You are punching
and kicking the space debris,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.584
because the Astro cereal
has made you mГѓВЎs fuerte. Strong.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.250
- Okay?
- MГѓВЎs.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.876
And then later, Randy will do all
the actually dangerous work.

07:57.918 --> 08:01.709
I'm sorry, I'm going to be
doing my own stunts.

08:01.751 --> 08:03.959
Ho, ho, check this guy out.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.209
Randy, he is giving you a run
for your money.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.918
Literally.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.292
Okay, you ready, Wray?

08:09.334 --> 08:11.792
I was born ready.

08:11.834 --> 08:12.834
- Okay.
- Move him up.

08:12.876 --> 08:14.542
Wires up.

08:14.584 --> 08:17.542
Oh!

08:17.584 --> 08:20.083
What I meant to say was...
( groans )

08:20.125 --> 08:23.000
You got pinched a little bit, buddy.
I'm going to bring you down.

08:23.042 --> 08:27.334
No, no, I'm fine. It's the pain.
I build on pain, I like it.

08:27.375 --> 08:31.375
Nice, Wray.
Use that for the character, okay?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.208
Girl: Can I have it quiet on set.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.833
And, action.

08:41.876 --> 08:44.918
Okay, Wray, the asteroids
are coming at you.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.292
You're punching at them.

08:46.334 --> 08:48.918
The asteroids are coming at you
from all directions.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.834
There's so many of them.

08:50.876 --> 08:51.876
Okay, you're a baby bird

08:51.918 --> 08:54.167
and there's a mongoose
coming to get you.

08:54.209 --> 08:55.918
- What?
- Perfect.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.918
- Now, try to kick.
- I'm kick...

08:58.959 --> 08:59.959
( squeals )

09:00.000 --> 09:01.876
Okay, now try with a battle cry.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.667
( yelling )

09:03.709 --> 09:05.417
Diego:
Less like a dying gecko.

09:05.459 --> 09:06.459
( soft yelling )

09:06.501 --> 09:09.042
Okay, no, no, but you are in space,
so we can't here you.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.542
Now, say the line.

09:15.417 --> 09:16.792
No, we must hear the line.
Lift your visor. Lift your visor.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.834
Astros is packed
with 10 essential vitamins,

09:22.876 --> 09:26.125
which gives me,
nutrition power.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.209
- Now, kick again.
- Kick. Oh, my Lord.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.709
Kick again.

09:30.751 --> 09:32.959
- ( grunting )
- Cut.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.709
Perfecto.

09:34.751 --> 09:37.000
- There we go. I am bowing.
- Man: Everyone back to one.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.042
Hello, SeГѓВ±or Diego.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.209
This is amazing.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.959
Oh, Jesus God.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.751
Bobbie, what are you--
Give me the chair

09:44.792 --> 09:47.501
All right. I'm sorry, Wray.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.501
Did you shit in your pants?

09:49.542 --> 09:52.959
Oh god, I am sorry I did not bring
an extra adult diaper.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.167
You can use mine.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.125
No, you can't.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.709
Bobbie, this suit is ironing out
the wrinkles in my scrotum

10:04.751 --> 10:06.542
- and my leg is asleep.
- Mhm.

10:06.584 --> 10:07.834
What happened.

10:07.876 --> 10:09.751
You had enough
of that harness there, bud?

10:09.792 --> 10:14.751
Uh, not even close, bud.
Why don't you just-- Jesus.

10:14.792 --> 10:19.375
What is that smell?

10:19.417 --> 10:21.584
That is a wrap on Wray, everyone.

10:21.626 --> 10:24.626
- Really?
- Mhm, yeah we have you close up.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.876
So, Randy is going to do all the takes
with the real asteroid.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.667
I'm going to do the real asteroid work,
that's me. I got that.

10:30.709 --> 10:32.542
It's my job, Wray.

10:32.584 --> 10:35.834
Well, maybe now,
it's my job, Randy.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.792
Excellent, Wray.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.959
You know, you are not at all
like I pictured you from your picture.

10:44.375 --> 10:47.751
Look, uh, these asteroids
have some heft to them

10:47.792 --> 10:49.584
and Grant is new to the team

10:49.626 --> 10:53.959
If the most special little guy
in the planet, my son Clyde, were here

10:54.000 --> 10:55.834
I wouldn't let him do it.

10:55.876 --> 10:58.292
I got this.

10:58.334 --> 11:01.125
Wray, in all honesty,
I don't get paid if I don't do the stunt

11:01.167 --> 11:02.167
Oh.

11:02.209 --> 11:05.501
My special little buddy's mom
is out of the picture and...

11:05.542 --> 11:07.792
She's out of the picture, yeah.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.751
Man: Hoist him up.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.250
I'm so sorry.

11:11.292 --> 11:15.125
I guess I'm in the picture,
so, I'm sorry.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.876
Roll sound.

11:16.918 --> 11:18.626
Thank you.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.459
This is great.

11:24.709 --> 11:25.876
Man: Rolling.

11:25.918 --> 11:29.334
And, action.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.125
All right, kid. I-I have--
Diego: Punch them, Wray

11:32.167 --> 11:33.876
Oh no. ( laughs )

11:33.918 --> 11:35.375
Punch them, yes.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.292
Punch them like a desperate panther.

11:37.334 --> 11:38.459
He's using real rocks.

11:38.501 --> 11:39.501
Cue the satellite.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.042
Vitamins. I've got 10--
I've got tin-- 10.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.167
Cue the satellite

11:43.209 --> 11:47.417
10 of whoa. I mean,
Astros gives me 10 essential--

11:47.459 --> 11:49.125
Oh, God Almighty.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.459
Cut.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.834
What happened to my satellite?

11:53.876 --> 11:57.292
( lift engine rumbling )

11:57.334 --> 11:58.334
Okay, here you go.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.501
- Bobbie.
- Here, try this.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.334
What is that?
Smelling salts?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.751
Yeah it's made with bleach
and Cool Ranch Doritos.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.292
- That's disgusting.
- It's great.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.501
Your eye okay?

12:08.542 --> 12:10.250
Yeah, it is. It's-- Ah.

12:10.292 --> 12:14.751
I mean it's--
Look, I live for pain, so...

12:14.792 --> 12:16.918
The harness has cut off
the blood flow.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.626
- I'm bringing you down.
- No, no, no, no.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.167
I don't need blood flow
to my lower regions.

12:21.209 --> 12:26.083
Wray will be manlier with one testicle
than he is with two.

12:26.125 --> 12:29.125
That's right, you know what?
Go get them.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.459
Am I really going to lose a testicle?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.834
Here's the deal, I don't get paid
if I don't do the stunt.

12:34.876 --> 12:37.709
I'm a single father, Clyde's school
costs a lot of money.

12:37.751 --> 12:40.959
Yeah he's a special kid,
everybody's kid is special to them.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.918
He's special
because he's on the spectrum.

12:42.959 --> 12:46.000
Well I was on
the "Spectrum" spaceship.

12:46.042 --> 12:48.292
You're saying "the spectrum"

12:48.334 --> 12:50.167
and you mean a whole other thing
that he's not--

12:50.209 --> 12:53.000
I mean he's-- I'm sorry about that.

12:53.042 --> 12:56.751
It's just you really should put
that a different way.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.626
- Wray.
- Hey.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.042
You remind me of a bullfighter
that I know.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.250
- Really?
- He was a very brave man.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.292
He was so brave man
that when he was gored to death

13:05.334 --> 13:08.667
he laughed in the bull's face.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.792
He was a very weird man, like you.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.334
But, I envied his courage.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.542
Now, do you wish to keep going

13:14.584 --> 13:18.792
or do you want Randy
to take your place?

13:18.834 --> 13:20.167
Who da man?

13:20.209 --> 13:21.334
( laughs )
That's me.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.501
Good man, Wray.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.876
OlГѓВ©. ГѓВ“rale.

13:24.918 --> 13:27.959
Toro.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.459
I'm just going to test this out
and make sure it's still working, okay?

13:30.501 --> 13:32.876
- Yeah, actually, don't uh, because--
- Boys.

13:32.918 --> 13:34.292
( groans )

13:34.334 --> 13:37.167
I still have feeling
in my nethers.

13:37.209 --> 13:38.501
Give it to me. Give it to me.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.542
Give, give, give it.

13:40.584 --> 13:43.501
- Working pretty good.
- Okay.

13:47.876 --> 13:51.792
Okay. And, Action.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.250
Punch them, Wray.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.292
Punch them.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.792
You are bitter.
You're bitter.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.834
Hey, Randy, you're not supposed
to be doing that.

13:59.876 --> 14:01.834
Stop hitting with your face.
Hit it with your fist.

14:01.876 --> 14:04.542
Cue the satellite.

14:04.584 --> 14:05.626
Perfect.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.125
- Cue this other satellite.
- Astro cereal.

14:08.167 --> 14:11.083
Good God, I bit my tongue.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.292
Perfecto. Cut.

14:12.334 --> 14:15.125
Bravo.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.751
( whining )

14:16.792 --> 14:17.792
Girl: Medic.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.667
You're an asshole, Randy.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.667
You should have let the pro do the stunt.
I needed that money.

14:22.709 --> 14:26.876
No wonder your wife
is out of the picture.

14:26.918 --> 14:28.834
She died.

14:28.876 --> 14:32.501
( whimpering )

14:32.542 --> 14:35.626
Who says it like that?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.542
Nice job, Wray.

14:37.584 --> 14:39.250
You are very courageous.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.209
No, listen, Diego, Diego, please.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.626
I think I would make
a really good addition

14:45.667 --> 14:48.792
to, "Doctor Cop Lawyer."

14:48.834 --> 14:50.375
Say more words at me.

14:50.417 --> 14:53.584
I think... I think I could play...
I could play

14:53.626 --> 14:56.459
Slater MD.

14:57.501 --> 15:01.918
Limp, lisp, one eye.

15:03.125 --> 15:06.667
Wray, by God
I think you may be right.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.083
Really?

15:08.125 --> 15:11.125
( music playing )

15:13.125 --> 15:14.501
Did you tell them
that I'm manly?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.375
Did you tell them that?
'Cause I am.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.501
- Hello Kitty lemonade spritz.
- Thank you.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.626
Welcome to the Imaginesium.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.125
Meet my dear friend,
Wray Nerely.

15:23.167 --> 15:26.250
You may recognize him
from his space TV show,

15:26.292 --> 15:28.375
- "Specula."
- "Spectrum."

15:28.417 --> 15:29.584
"Spectrum." Of course.

15:29.626 --> 15:31.792
- I will see you in Hell.
- Oh, ( expletive ).

15:31.834 --> 15:33.083
Wait, what's that from?

15:33.125 --> 15:35.000
Um, he played Cash
on "Spectrum."

15:35.042 --> 15:36.334
It was a big hit.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.125
- Why haven't I heard of it?
- It's a cult hit.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.834
Ugh, ugh.
