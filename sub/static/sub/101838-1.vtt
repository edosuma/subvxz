03:09.148 --> 03:10.783
Diablos!

05:08.768 --> 05:11.369
<i>Falcon
Main, this is Bravo Team.</i>

05:14.240 --> 05:17.375
<i>Falcon Main, this is
Bravo Team. Do you copy?</i>

05:17.509 --> 05:19.312
<i>Storm incoming.
Zero visibility.</i>

05:19.444 --> 05:21.314
<i>Request immediate support.</i>

05:23.149 --> 05:25.051
<i>Falcon Main, something's
in here with us.</i>

05:25.184 --> 05:26.619
<i>Send immediate support.</i>

05:33.059 --> 05:34.827
<i>Falcon Main,
this is Bravo Team.</i>

05:34.961 --> 05:36.329
<i>Send immediate support.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:37.663
Ma'am.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.732
- Ma'am.
- Marshall.

05:39.866 --> 05:41.701
Link found something
half a klick ahead.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.003
- Bravo Team?
- Think so.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.403
Axe.

05:45.538 --> 05:47.505
- With Steeler. Man the 50.
- Yes, boss.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.042
All right, ladies.
Saddle up.

05:51.509 --> 05:53.546
She's a woman,
but she still manages

05:53.679 --> 05:56.082
to make that sound
like an insult.

05:56.215 --> 05:57.984
Get used to it.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.276
Captain. You see those markers?

06:23.408 --> 06:24.509
Yeah, I see them.

06:26.045 --> 06:27.680
Do you have any idea
what they are?

06:27.813 --> 06:30.583
Sergeant Davis, I'm a Ranger,
not an archeologist.

06:32.051 --> 06:33.653
Copy that.

06:33.786 --> 06:35.453
<i>♪ Well, in North Carolina ♪</i>

06:35.588 --> 06:37.556

06:37.690 --> 06:40.359
- Axe!
- What?

06:40.492 --> 06:43.863
- What are you listening to?
- George Jones.

06:45.097 --> 06:46.265
Who the hell's that?

06:47.667 --> 06:49.302
You're a philistine, Steeler.

06:49.434 --> 06:50.836
Yes. Yes, I am.

06:53.471 --> 06:55.408
Damn, Marshall.
You got hella reflexes.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.442
Fifteenth casualty today.

06:57.576 --> 06:59.946
- Killing them.
- Take no prisoners, Davis.

- Link, what'd you find?
- It's definitely Bravo Team.

07:21.334 --> 07:22.500
But the tracks end here.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.938
What were
Bravo Team traveling in?

07:26.072 --> 07:28.641
Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV.

07:28.774 --> 07:30.776
That's 10 tons
of armored vehicle.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.678
They don't just disappear.

07:32.812 --> 07:34.479
Boss, we've got something.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.649
Incoming. On your 12.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.189
- Where did that come from?
- Out of nowhere.

07:43.322 --> 07:45.791
Bravo Team reported a storm
in their last transmission.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.527
- Hostiles using it for cover?
- An ambush. Like in Helmand?

07:48.661 --> 07:50.162
Let's not find out.

07:59.972 --> 08:03.209
REDCON-1. If there are hostiles
hiding behind that storm,

08:03.342 --> 08:04.577
<i>things might get kinetic.</i>

08:04.710 --> 08:05.811
Copy that.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.693
Marshall,
what are you doing, bro?

08:20.826 --> 08:24.196
In case I get my head blown off,
they can still tell who I am.

08:24.330 --> 08:27.233
Ha-ha-ha!
Hardcore shit, <i>cabrón.</i>

08:38.677 --> 08:40.078
Damn!

08:43.381 --> 08:45.384
Goddamn, that shit's close!

08:45.518 --> 08:48.521
Link, you ever seen lightning
like this before?

08:48.654 --> 08:50.222
No. Never.

08:50.356 --> 08:53.426
But I feel pretty secure here
in this big steel box,

08:53.559 --> 08:55.361
holding my metal gun.

09:04.036 --> 09:07.740
Dash, on your 12!
Look at those markers!

09:10.309 --> 09:11.877
What the hell is that?

09:13.279 --> 09:14.747
- Watch out!
- Damn it!

09:15.848 --> 09:17.683
Brace yourselves!

09:32.765 --> 09:34.767
Shit!

10:21.480 --> 10:23.082
Where the hell are we?

10:23.215 --> 10:25.651
And what happened to the storm?

10:25.784 --> 10:27.119
What the hell just happened?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.125
- Hey!
- Guys!

10:33.259 --> 10:34.628
You okay?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.362
Ugh, I'll survive.

10:36.495 --> 10:38.964
Did we just get hit
by lightning?

10:39.098 --> 10:41.734
- Steeler, you good?
- Never better.

10:43.603 --> 10:45.437
Where did
all this sand come from?

10:49.341 --> 10:51.177
This isn't
right, none of it.

10:52.579 --> 10:53.779
What the hell is that?

10:55.615 --> 10:59.051
I don't see any structures
or mountains marked on this map.

10:59.185 --> 11:03.489
According to this, the nearest
sand dune is 20 klicks away.

11:03.623 --> 11:05.724
- How's that possible?
- Where the hell are we?

11:05.858 --> 11:07.893
How did we get
so far from the road?

11:08.027 --> 11:09.828
I don't know.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.363
Axe, get on one of those dunes

11:11.497 --> 11:15.034
- and set up an observation point.
- Yes, boss.

11:15.167 --> 11:18.270
- Steeler!
- DPV will run. She's had worse.

11:18.404 --> 11:21.240
- Marshall?
- GPS is fried, boss.

11:21.373 --> 11:23.042
Radio and sat.
All I get is static.

11:23.175 --> 11:25.778
Even the compass is screwed up.
Must've been the lightning.

11:25.911 --> 11:27.780
Well, what do you wanna do?

11:30.015 --> 11:32.318
Go analog. Navigate by the sun.

11:32.451 --> 11:34.688
Make it back to base.
We hoof it if we have to.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.088
Boss, that's a long hike.

11:36.222 --> 11:38.190
Yeah, well,
we keep going till we get comms.

11:38.324 --> 11:42.261
Then AWACS will call in support.
They'll send helos, maybe armor.

11:45.397 --> 11:46.999
- Nice.
- Back in business.

11:47.132 --> 11:48.668
<i>- Boss.</i>
- Send it.

11:48.801 --> 11:51.237
<i>There's something
you gotta see.</i>

12:04.316 --> 12:07.319
Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV.

12:07.453 --> 12:08.787
It's Bravo Team.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.058
V-formation. Move out.

12:21.701 --> 12:24.103
- What do we do about them?
- When we get comms,

12:24.236 --> 12:27.373
we'll call in recovery assets
to retrieve the bodies.

12:29.141 --> 12:31.944
- What happened to them?
- Flamethrowers.

12:32.077 --> 12:32.978
I don't think so.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.684
Never seen a flamethrower
do this to a man.

12:37.816 --> 12:39.885
Not even napalm burns that hot.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.320
Ma'am?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.962
It's glass.

12:50.095 --> 12:51.297
Glass?

12:51.430 --> 12:53.265
When sand melts,
it turns to glass.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.200
How do you melt sand?

12:56.468 --> 12:57.803
I don't know.

12:59.038 --> 13:00.472
This shit is officially

13:00.607 --> 13:01.974
above my pay grade.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.177
Looks like they made a stand.

13:07.346 --> 13:10.482
- Let off a lot of rounds.
- They didn't hit anything.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.184
There's no bodies.

13:12.318 --> 13:15.154
Maybe they took
the bodies with them?

13:15.287 --> 13:17.856
- I've seen that before.
- Yeah.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.926
- Well, that's just the thing.
- What do you see, Link?

13:22.294 --> 13:23.896
Nothing.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.998
No tracks anywhere.

13:26.131 --> 13:28.200
Whoever did this,
they didn't leave a mark.

13:30.469 --> 13:32.905
We need to get moving. Move out!

13:45.017 --> 13:48.755
Dark Star to Falcon.
Dark Star to Falcon, over.

13:48.887 --> 13:52.291
Damn it. Lightning really
messed up the electronics, huh?

13:52.424 --> 13:53.926
Not just the electronics.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.162
- What do you mean?
- This isn't right.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.897
Nothing about this is right.

13:59.031 --> 14:02.836
That lightning,
it did something to us.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.638

Saw a dinosaur in a museum
one time. It wasn't that big.

16:12.297 --> 16:14.366
Hostile, 12 o'clock, 300 meters!

16:17.169 --> 16:19.806

- It's just chalk.

Diablos.

16:35.755 --> 16:37.055
On our 6!

16:42.862 --> 16:44.731
What the hell is that?

16:44.864 --> 16:46.833
Link, back in the vehicle.

16:46.966 --> 16:49.301
Dash, Steeler, move, move, move!

16:58.310 --> 16:59.812
Fire!

17:17.362 --> 17:18.363
It's gaining on us!

17:48.728 --> 17:50.295
You're caught.

18:00.272 --> 18:01.674
- Come on, get out of here!
- No way!

18:01.808 --> 18:03.442
- One...
- Holy...

18:03.576 --> 18:04.577
...two, three!

18:10.349 --> 18:12.018
Fire!

18:12.150 --> 18:13.987
Give me your hand. Come on!

18:27.100 --> 18:28.333
Dash! Come on!

18:28.467 --> 18:30.103
I'm trying!

18:33.271 --> 18:34.774
Steeler!

18:36.609 --> 18:38.143
Got it, got it!

18:38.276 --> 18:40.345
Marshall, get in!

18:42.749 --> 18:44.282
Let's go, big boy!

18:46.786 --> 18:48.153
Give me your hand!

18:50.823 --> 18:52.190
Get inside!

18:54.761 --> 18:56.929
Link, get the RPG!

19:39.304 --> 19:40.238
Oh, my God.

19:56.022 --> 19:59.058
Fall back! Fall back!

19:59.192 --> 20:00.593
Run for cover!

20:06.666 --> 20:07.900
Captain!

20:09.035 --> 20:10.069
Come on!

20:13.505 --> 20:14.907
Come on, boss!

20:39.699 --> 20:41.601
I got it, I got it! Move, move!

20:46.739 --> 20:47.740
Reloading!

21:13.065 --> 21:15.467
What was that thing?
What is that?

21:15.601 --> 21:17.003
I told you. I told you.

21:17.136 --> 21:18.638
That light,
it took us somewhere.

21:18.771 --> 21:20.540
We need to get back.
We need to get back home.

21:20.673 --> 21:23.475
- Stow it, Sergeant Davis.
- Oh, God. We're gonna die here.

21:23.609 --> 21:25.945
Shut that shit up right now,
soldier. That's an order.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.647
You see what it did
to Steeler and Axe?

21:27.780 --> 21:29.749
Dash, hey.

21:29.882 --> 21:31.184
I got three. You?

21:31.316 --> 21:32.852
- What?
- Three mags left.

21:32.985 --> 21:34.720
What does it matter?
Did you see that?

21:34.854 --> 21:36.454
It matters
because we're soldiers.

21:36.589 --> 21:38.356
And this is what we do.
We fight.

21:38.490 --> 21:41.359
- Am I right?
- Rangers lead the way.

21:41.493 --> 21:43.361
- You with me?
- Always, boss.

21:43.495 --> 21:45.131
You're all crazy.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.201
You know, I don't care
what the hell that thing is.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.871
We do what we do best.
We fight and we survive.

21:52.004 --> 21:54.574
No matter what the odds.
You got it?

21:54.707 --> 21:56.542
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:56.676 --> 21:58.110
You got it?

21:59.712 --> 22:00.847
Loud and clear, ma'am.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.549
Now, I got three left.
What about you?

22:22.201 --> 22:23.669
Med pack!

22:25.705 --> 22:27.372
- CPR, Marshall.
- On it.

22:29.441 --> 22:31.344
- It's too late.
- Bullshit!

22:31.476 --> 22:34.046
Don't die on me, Ranger.
Come on.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.916
- Lack of pulse.
- Unacceptable. Try it again.

22:37.049 --> 22:39.352
- I'm sorry.
- Shit! There's more of them!

22:41.386 --> 22:42.755
Come on! We have to go!

22:44.123 --> 22:45.224
They're everywhere!

22:45.358 --> 22:46.325
I'm sorry.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.426
Master sergeant!

22:48.561 --> 22:50.696
- Link!
- All right, on me!

22:50.830 --> 22:53.532
Let's move out!

22:53.666 --> 22:55.234
Fall back, fall back!

23:40.112 --> 23:41.647
Dash!

23:41.781 --> 23:43.616
Come on!
Keep moving!

23:43.749 --> 23:45.351
Marshall!

23:51.924 --> 23:53.326
Go, go, go!

23:59.265 --> 24:00.766
No!

24:31.797 --> 24:33.099
Link.

24:33.232 --> 24:35.334
Dash.

25:33.893 --> 25:35.227
Dash.

25:37.296 --> 25:38.431
Dash.

28:10.849 --> 28:12.017
- You're alive.
- Link.

28:13.719 --> 28:15.487
What is it? What is it?

28:15.622 --> 28:16.989
Pain in my chest!

28:17.122 --> 28:18.090
I can't feel my arm.

28:18.224 --> 28:19.959
Some sort of poison.

28:20.092 --> 28:23.597
You just gotta work through it.
Come on. Let's move. Come on.

28:25.364 --> 28:26.600
All right.

28:34.006 --> 28:36.576
Oh, God.

28:38.712 --> 28:40.112
Oh, no.

28:43.349 --> 28:44.450
Captain.

28:46.418 --> 28:48.754
All right, it's just
a little further. Let's go.

28:51.757 --> 28:54.994
- Ugh! I can't move.
- Oh!

28:55.127 --> 28:56.663
Okay, let me see.

28:56.795 --> 28:58.598
Let me see what it is.

29:04.403 --> 29:05.971
Go!

29:13.279 --> 29:14.813
Oh, my God!

29:17.916 --> 29:19.251
God, Link! No!

29:19.385 --> 29:20.919
You gotta go!

29:26.091 --> 29:27.926
Link!

32:34.714 --> 32:36.081
Damn you.

32:40.452 --> 32:41.654
Damn you!

32:48.928 --> 32:50.496
But I'm coming home.

38:29.769 --> 38:31.137
Nerscylla.

38:35.675 --> 38:37.910
- Nerscylla!
- Get off me.

39:55.888 --> 39:58.224
Nice life you've...

42:01.547 --> 42:03.182
See how you like it.

42:10.656 --> 42:11.590
Cheers.

42:14.260 --> 42:15.694
Oh!

42:15.828 --> 42:18.264
Oh, you spiteful little bastard.

42:29.975 --> 42:32.211
Hey. How about that?

42:32.344 --> 42:35.549
Yeah. You don't like that, huh?
Not so funny now, huh?

42:50.530 --> 42:51.797
I'll kill you.

44:23.722 --> 44:24.757
Come on!

44:26.258 --> 44:28.360
Push! Push!

44:56.956 --> 44:57.890
Here.

45:01.994 --> 45:03.262
I'm not your enemy.

45:04.997 --> 45:06.165
Wait, wait.

45:07.199 --> 45:08.535
Wait.

45:10.002 --> 45:13.707
One second. Look. Look.

45:13.839 --> 45:14.773
Here.

45:16.242 --> 45:18.043
Food.

45:18.177 --> 45:20.779
Food. Here.

45:20.913 --> 45:22.314
Take it.

45:29.188 --> 45:30.557
Here, give it to me.

45:30.690 --> 45:32.592
Look, look.

45:34.093 --> 45:35.695
Mmm.

45:35.828 --> 45:37.263
Mmm, so good.

45:40.199 --> 45:41.534
Mmm.

45:45.371 --> 45:47.306
Mmm.

45:47.439 --> 45:49.908
- Mmm.
- It's good, right?

45:50.042 --> 45:51.910
Oh, wow.

45:52.044 --> 45:55.881
Heh. Slow down. Okay, it's good.

45:56.015 --> 45:57.983
- It's chocolate.
- Hmm?

45:58.117 --> 46:00.119
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate.

46:00.252 --> 46:01.387
Yeah, chocolate.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.422
Chocolate.

46:06.525 --> 46:08.227
Chocolate.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.262
- Choco...
- Chocolate!

46:10.396 --> 46:13.098
- Chocolate!
- I don't have any more.

46:13.232 --> 46:16.502
No, no more, no more, no more.
Look, look. Nothing.

46:17.803 --> 46:19.305
I'm sorry.

46:27.946 --> 46:30.282
Oh.

46:30.416 --> 46:34.688
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

46:36.790 --> 46:38.490
Mmm.

46:40.660 --> 46:42.027
Thank you.

46:45.064 --> 46:46.365
Hey.

46:48.367 --> 46:50.336
Wait! Where are you going?

46:55.140 --> 46:56.241
Wait!

47:20.734 --> 47:23.703
Me and you go out there?

47:23.837 --> 47:28.040
Yes. That lightning, I think
that's what brought me here.

47:28.173 --> 47:31.176
I need to go there.
I need to get home.

47:33.546 --> 47:36.215
That thing is still out there.

47:36.348 --> 47:39.151
- Diablos.
- Diablos.

47:46.458 --> 47:47.393
Hey, over there...

47:48.661 --> 47:50.129
I have weapons.

47:50.262 --> 47:51.263
Uh...

47:52.431 --> 47:54.066
Diablos... kssh!

47:57.604 --> 48:00.038
What?

48:15.588 --> 48:16.955
<i>Ni trovi</i> Nerscylla.

48:18.390 --> 48:19.992
- What?
- Nerscylla.

48:20.125 --> 48:23.663
No. We don't need
to go back in there.

48:25.197 --> 48:28.635
We need to go out there.
Diablos.

48:31.805 --> 48:33.606
Diablos.
Diablos.

48:34.741 --> 48:35.941
Nerscylla.

48:37.677 --> 48:39.211
Pssh! Diablo...

48:43.883 --> 48:45.417
We poison it.

48:48.621 --> 48:50.657
Smart.

48:50.790 --> 48:53.158
To kill a monster,
you need a monster.

48:55.562 --> 48:58.130
But how are we gonna get
one of those things?

49:05.638 --> 49:06.673
What?

49:08.307 --> 49:10.075

Next time, you're bait!

51:05.090 --> 51:06.291
"Ranger."

51:08.226 --> 51:09.796
That's me.

51:13.833 --> 51:15.200
Ranger.

51:15.334 --> 51:17.402
Yeah. Yeah.

51:25.778 --> 51:26.679
Hunter.

51:26.813 --> 51:27.981
Hunter. Ranger.

51:28.113 --> 51:29.782
- Yeah. Yes.
- Hunter?

51:38.156 --> 51:39.157
Velcro.

51:40.292 --> 51:42.127
- Velcro.
- Yeah.

51:49.068 --> 51:50.670
Velcro. Velcro.

51:53.271 --> 51:55.942
Okay. All right, all right.
That's enough. That's enough.

51:59.078 --> 52:00.278
Oh, man.

52:02.347 --> 52:04.349
Really trying
to get in here, huh?

52:27.840 --> 52:29.008
Is that your family?

52:36.716 --> 52:40.153
Are you gonna see them?
Are you gonna go home?

52:43.522 --> 52:44.791
Home?

53:04.711 --> 53:06.045
I'm sorry.

53:22.829 --> 53:23.730
Rathalos.

53:58.330 --> 53:59.464
Let's do this.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.400
Hmm?

54:05.138 --> 54:06.606
Never mind. Let's go.

54:24.791 --> 54:26.291
Ready!

54:55.288 --> 54:56.354
Whoa!

55:09.168 --> 55:10.803
- Yeah!
- Wow!

55:30.857 --> 55:32.524
Ahh!

55:39.799 --> 55:41.433
Wah!
Whoa!

55:53.012 --> 55:54.313
What is that?

55:54.446 --> 55:56.481
You gotta tell me about that.

55:56.616 --> 55:58.718
You can't
just do that to somebody.

56:24.310 --> 56:25.711
Any second now.

57:28.574 --> 57:30.109
Stop!

57:51.764 --> 57:53.199
Bait!

58:30.636 --> 58:32.671
Yeah!

59:31.997 --> 59:32.898
Shit!

01:04:04.236 --> 01:04:05.437
Come on!

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:14.913
Watch over him!

01:05:14.707 --> 01:05:15.941
You're welcome.

01:06:21.574 --> 01:06:22.675
Wow.

01:06:31.283 --> 01:06:32.384
Apceros.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.754
Apceros.

01:06:46.265 --> 01:06:48.033
- Apceros.
- Yeah.

01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:51.136
Okay. Okay. They eat grass.

01:06:55.374 --> 01:06:57.376
Water. Water.

01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.092
Bait.

01:07:16.461 --> 01:07:17.362
Bait?

01:07:19.032 --> 01:07:19.933
You're funny.

01:07:22.035 --> 01:07:25.504
Know what I'm gonna do next time
you're dying in the desert?

01:07:25.638 --> 01:07:27.272
Nothing.

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:42.220
That smells good.

01:07:43.957 --> 01:07:46.726
- Catch Cephalos.
- I'll eat anything at this point.

01:07:56.435 --> 01:07:57.436
Home.

01:07:58.705 --> 01:08:01.608
Yeah. My way home.

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:02.976
I hope.

01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:10.850
Chocolate.

01:08:14.386 --> 01:08:15.822
Mmm.

01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:18.957
Mmm, chocolate. Mmm.

01:08:20.059 --> 01:08:21.393
Mmm.

01:08:24.196 --> 01:08:25.765
So good.

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:28.734
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:08:32.604 --> 01:08:33.840
What's that?

01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:37.376
Whoa!

01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:40.880
All right.

01:08:42.682 --> 01:08:44.349
Uh-uh-uh...

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:48.353
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Chocolate.

01:08:48.487 --> 01:08:49.856
No, no, no.

01:08:52.256 --> 01:08:54.393
- Chocolate.
- Not chocolate.

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.714
- What's going on?
- Rathalos.

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:50.750
You said that before.

01:09:50.883 --> 01:09:52.250
What the hell is
a Rathalos?

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:41.266
Whoa!

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:33.286
Thank you.

01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:36.088
Thank you.

01:11:37.723 --> 01:11:39.357
Don't thank me yet.

01:11:57.677 --> 01:11:59.178
Enjoying the show?

01:12:13.025 --> 01:12:15.161
Whoo!

01:12:15.294 --> 01:12:17.964
This one
must have come from the sky.

01:13:50.957 --> 01:13:52.291
What?

01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:01.934
What is that?

01:14:03.302 --> 01:14:04.203
Palico.

01:14:14.347 --> 01:14:17.616
My friend tells me
I misjudged you...

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.852
that I might even
owe you an apology.

01:14:21.153 --> 01:14:22.922
Just don't hold your breath.

01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:28.027
Why did you put me in chains?

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.595
What are you so afraid of?

01:14:29.729 --> 01:14:31.931
Your world...

01:14:32.064 --> 01:14:34.133
and what it could do to mine.

01:14:34.266 --> 01:14:36.669
You aren't the first
to cross over from your world.

01:14:36.802 --> 01:14:38.270
There were others.

01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:39.638
A long time ago.

01:14:39.772 --> 01:14:41.807
That's how you speak
my language?

01:14:41.941 --> 01:14:45.611
- Mmm, I made a study of it.
- What happened to me?

01:14:47.146 --> 01:14:48.647
How did I get here?

01:14:48.781 --> 01:14:52.018
I believe that the answers
we both seek lie here.

01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:58.157
At the peak of that mountain
lies the Sky Tower.

01:14:59.558 --> 01:15:02.828
Remnants
of an ancient civilization.

01:15:02.962 --> 01:15:05.931
Very advanced. Very dangerous.

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:09.735
It is said
that the Ancients knew

01:15:09.869 --> 01:15:12.004
how to travel
between both worlds.

01:15:12.138 --> 01:15:15.041
I believe that is the purpose
of the Sky Tower.

01:15:15.174 --> 01:15:18.110
That is what brought you here.

01:15:18.244 --> 01:15:20.546
What happened
to this ancient civilization?

01:15:22.348 --> 01:15:25.718
They destroyed themselves.
Their technology turned on them.

01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:28.754
You think my world
had something to do with it.

01:15:28.888 --> 01:15:32.191
I suspect. But an open gateway
between our two worlds

01:15:32.324 --> 01:15:34.660
was catastrophic once.

01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:37.363
I intend to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:39.698
We were on our way
to investigate the Sky Tower

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:41.867
when we strayed
into the Diablos.

01:15:42.001 --> 01:15:44.570
That's where I lost
my friend here.

01:15:44.703 --> 01:15:46.772
Tending to the wounded
and repairing the ship

01:15:46.906 --> 01:15:48.407
was our first priority.

01:15:48.542 --> 01:15:50.810
But now we resume our mission.

01:15:52.945 --> 01:15:55.114
The Ancients would
guard their technology

01:15:55.247 --> 01:15:57.049
with the most fearsome
of creatures,

01:15:57.183 --> 01:15:59.151
a Rathalos.

01:15:59.285 --> 01:16:01.587
Almost impossible to kill.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.491
Their only weakness is
just before they breathe fire.

01:16:05.624 --> 01:16:07.159
You help us
with the battle ahead,

01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:09.628
perhaps we can help you
get home.

01:16:17.236 --> 01:16:19.271
What's the matter?

01:16:19.405 --> 01:16:21.507
You don't have cats
in your world?

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:25.579
Hey!

01:16:26.912 --> 01:16:29.215
You been drinking
from my mug again?

01:16:37.623 --> 01:16:38.757
We leave at dawn.

01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:40.594
And don't keep me waiting.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.161
I hate waiting.

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:12.825
So? You ready?

01:17:14.293 --> 01:17:16.495
We got a hard climb ahead of us.

01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:30.509
Come on!

01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:23.729
We believe that the lava powers
the machinery within the tower.

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:28.033
It's controlling the storm.

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:33.405
Exactly.

01:18:36.408 --> 01:18:41.080
It's creating a gateway to your
world, but it looks unstable.

01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:45.217
Let's go.

01:19:08.274 --> 01:19:09.676
It's glass.

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:13.279
<i>Estas bone</i> Rathalos.

01:19:14.913 --> 01:19:16.181
Rathalos.

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:32.231
Prepare yourself.

01:19:32.364 --> 01:19:33.966
Remember, they're weak

01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:35.635
just before they breathe fire.

01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:57.751
Hey, ugly!

01:23:57.030 --> 01:24:01.034
It's okay! It's okay.
You're safe now! Get the medic!

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:06.539
Captain Artemis?

01:24:08.373 --> 01:24:10.643
Let's get her inside! Up!

01:24:12.779 --> 01:24:14.379
Let's go! Let's go!

01:24:20.218 --> 01:24:23.056
Captain,
we've been searching for you.

01:24:26.391 --> 01:24:27.994
What the hell is she wearing?

01:24:45.444 --> 01:24:48.581
Falcon Main, this is Red Wolf.

01:24:48.715 --> 01:24:50.717
<i>We've
made contact with Dark Star.</i>

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.052
We have a lone survivor.

01:24:53.185 --> 01:24:55.588
<i>I say again, a lone survivor.</i>

01:24:55.722 --> 01:24:57.289
<i>Ground forces are
securing the area.</i>

01:24:57.422 --> 01:24:58.323
Copy that, Red Wolf.

01:25:04.597 --> 01:25:05.832
Captain.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.400
Can you hear me?

01:25:08.534 --> 01:25:11.403
Can you hear me?

01:25:11.537 --> 01:25:13.006
Captain?

01:25:13.138 --> 01:25:14.139
Captain Artemis?

01:25:15.775 --> 01:25:18.111
Where are the rest of your men?

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:21.179
- My men?
- Yes.

01:25:21.313 --> 01:25:23.816
Where
are the rest of Alpha Team?

01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:26.786
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:25:34.326 --> 01:25:36.161
We're under attack!

01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:17.537
Aim for the belly!

01:26:28.147 --> 01:26:29.414
<i>A Rathalos.</i>

01:27:03.248 --> 01:27:04.382
Load!

01:27:05.685 --> 01:27:07.019
Fire!

01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:26.572
No! No!

01:27:49.195 --> 01:27:50.163
No!

01:27:52.297 --> 01:27:54.233
It's coming right for us!

01:27:54.366 --> 01:27:55.300
Evade!

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:09.782
<i>We're on Channel 5.
Interference is...</i>

01:28:15.387 --> 01:28:16.454
My God.

01:29:29.729 --> 01:29:31.429
Come on!

01:30:20.346 --> 01:30:21.614
I got you.

01:31:32.618 --> 01:31:33.986
My friend.

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:41.227
Thought
you might need a little help.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.595
Yeah, I...

01:31:42.728 --> 01:31:44.730
still don't understand you, man.

01:31:47.166 --> 01:31:49.201
Oh, yeah.

01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:52.371
Friends.

01:31:56.542 --> 01:31:58.844
Yeah, thank you.

01:31:58.978 --> 01:32:00.579
<i>Min misa</i> chocolate?

01:32:02.481 --> 01:32:04.583
I don't have
any more chocolate.

01:32:07.686 --> 01:32:08.587
Think fast.

01:32:10.556 --> 01:32:12.425
- You're here.
- We came to help.

01:32:12.558 --> 01:32:15.094
We can't have monsters
from my world attacking yours.

01:32:18.798 --> 01:32:20.534
It's starting again.

01:32:26.005 --> 01:32:27.940
We don't have much time.

01:32:28.074 --> 01:32:29.708
There's going to be
another attack.

01:32:39.385 --> 01:32:41.754
We have to get back.

01:32:41.887 --> 01:32:43.589
We have
to shut the Sky Tower down.

01:32:45.057 --> 01:32:46.492
Let's try
to live through this first.

01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:48.060
Copy that.
