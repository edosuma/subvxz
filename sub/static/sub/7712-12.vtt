WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.706
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

00:02.739 --> 00:03.708
I NEED YOUR IDEAS NOW.

00:03.741 --> 00:07.283
IDEAS, PLEASE, RIGHT NOW.
GO, GO, COME ON!

00:07.315 --> 00:09.087
MICHAEL, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:09.119 --> 00:10.422
WET CEMENT OUTSIDE,
IT'S DRYING FAST.

00:10.454 --> 00:12.625
COME ON, THIS IS
A LIFELONG DREAM.

00:12.658 --> 00:14.196
WHAT DO I WRITE?
WHAT DO I WRITE?

00:14.229 --> 00:16.067
MICHAEL, YOU COULD PUT
YOUR INITIALS IN IT.

00:16.101 --> 00:17.735
M.G.S., NO.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.808
SOME IDIOT NAMED
MARK GREG SPUTNIK

00:20.842 --> 00:22.346
WILL CLAIM CREDIT FOR IT.

00:22.378 --> 00:24.583
I DON'T--ONCE IN A LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY, PEOPLE.

00:24.617 --> 00:26.087
COME ON, HERE WE GO!

00:26.121 --> 00:27.020
HERE WE GO.
WELL--

00:27.055 --> 00:29.392
PHYLLIS, YES?
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL...

00:29.427 --> 00:30.862
OKAY.

00:30.894 --> 00:32.133
OKAY, DO IT!

00:32.166 --> 00:33.367
COME ON, GREAT,
LET'S HEAR IT!

00:33.400 --> 00:35.339
WE FOUND SOME WET CEMENT
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

00:35.371 --> 00:36.406
IT'S DRYING,
IT'S DRYING.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.875
ALL RIGHT, PHYLLIS,
COME ON!

00:37.908 --> 00:40.115
WHAT DID WE WRITE?

00:40.149 --> 00:42.452
AAH!
COME ON!

00:42.485 --> 00:44.257
DRAW A PICTURE.
NO!

00:44.290 --> 00:46.393
'CAUSE THAT SAYS SO MUCH
MORE THAN WORDS.
NO, NO!

00:46.426 --> 00:47.763
COME ON, GIVE ME
SOMETHING GOOD!

00:47.796 --> 00:49.466
OKAY, I WAS WATCHING E!,
AND I SAW WILL SMITH

00:49.499 --> 00:50.669
OUTSIDE THE CHINESE THEATER,

00:50.702 --> 00:51.903
AND, OH, MY GOD,
HE LOOKED SO GOOD.

00:51.936 --> 00:53.507
PAM, TRANSLATE.

00:53.540 --> 00:54.576
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE HANDPRINTS

00:54.610 --> 00:56.181
THAT CELEBRITIES MAKE
IN CEMENT.

00:56.214 --> 00:57.249
I LOVE IT!

00:57.283 --> 00:58.718
IF YOU WERE A REAL STAR,
YOU'D PUT YOUR FACE IN IT.

00:58.751 --> 00:59.887
I LOVE IT MORE!

00:59.919 --> 01:01.924
MICHAEL, THAT DOESN'T
SEEM SAFE TO--

01:01.957 --> 01:03.628
I LOVE IT!

01:03.660 --> 01:05.832
[laughing]
COME ON, LET'S GO!

01:05.864 --> 01:09.339
[Kevin and Dwight laughing]

01:09.373 --> 01:12.745
WE ARE HERE TODAY
NOT TO IMMORTALIZE A MAN,

01:12.778 --> 01:14.650
BUT AN IDEA.

01:14.682 --> 01:15.784
MAYBE THE IDEA OF A MAN.

01:15.818 --> 01:17.956
HURRY, PLEASE.

01:17.988 --> 01:19.727
GREATNESS IS ONLY SKIN-DEEP
SOME PEOPLE SAY.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.331
CAN YOU BREATHE?
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.733
OTHER PEOPLE BELIEVE
IT'S DEEPER INSIDE...

01:22.766 --> 01:24.970
HOLD YOUR BREATH.
READY.
AND IN THIS CASE,
THAT'S ALSO NOT TRUE.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.776
AND...GO!

01:27.808 --> 01:29.879
FORCE IT IN
AS DEEP AS YOU CAN.

01:29.913 --> 01:31.316
[Michael muttering]

01:31.351 --> 01:33.487
TODAY'S A VERY SPECIAL DAY
FOR ME.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.890
AND IT'S REALLY
NOT ABOUT ME.

01:34.922 --> 01:38.831
IT'S ABOUT MY GRANDKIDS.
IT'S ABOUT MY GREAT-GRANDKIDS.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.636
I CAN COME BACK HERE
WHEN I'M 100,

01:41.670 --> 01:45.578
AND I CAN FIND THAT PIECE
OF CEMENT AND SAY,

01:45.611 --> 01:47.483
"THAT'S ME.
LOOK, KIDS.

01:47.515 --> 01:49.017
YOUR DADDY LEFT
THAT FACEHOLE"

01:49.050 --> 01:51.456
I DON'T KNOW.

01:51.491 --> 01:53.261
IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

01:53.295 --> 01:57.001
[cheerful music]

01:57.033 --> 02:05.452
*

02:13.900 --> 02:17.608
OKAY.
ADJECTIVE.

02:17.643 --> 02:19.847
UM...TALL.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.517
NO, NO, UH, NICE.

02:21.550 --> 02:23.321
GOOD ONE.

02:23.355 --> 02:24.957
OKAY.
YOU READY?

02:24.989 --> 02:26.693
MM-HMM.

02:26.726 --> 02:31.001
"THE TALL MAN ENTERED
THE NICE BUILDING,

02:31.035 --> 02:34.676
"TO VISIT
A VERY NICE MAN.

02:34.709 --> 02:37.883
"'SIT DOWN, MR. SMITH.

02:37.916 --> 02:41.556
"CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN ANY GOOD CAT FOOD?'"

02:41.591 --> 02:45.532
[laughing]
IT'S A MAN EATING CAT FOOD!

02:45.564 --> 02:47.836
WHAT ABOUT A CAT
EATING MAN FOOD?

02:47.869 --> 02:50.007
ANDY AND ANGELA SEEM
VERY HAPPY.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.046
I HOPE NOTHING HORRIBLE
EVER HAPPENS TO THEM.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.464
UM, YEAH, I SLEPT OVER

03:01.497 --> 03:03.501
AT A, UH, FRIEND'S HOUSE,

03:03.534 --> 03:06.005
AND I FORGOT
MY CONTACT SOLUTION.

03:06.038 --> 03:08.810
SO I HAD TO WEAR
MY BACK-UP GLASSES.

03:10.749 --> 03:12.050
SHUT UP.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.522
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

03:14.556 --> 03:15.759
OH, MY GOD.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.095
PAM...THOSE MAKE YOU
LOOK SO UGLY.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.569
UM, PAM, IN ORDER
TO GET HOTTER,

03:20.601 --> 03:21.836
YOU TAKE THE GLASSES OFF.

03:21.870 --> 03:23.139
YOU'RE MOVING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

03:23.172 --> 03:24.742
I DON'T HAVE MY CONTACT--

03:24.777 --> 03:25.945
BLAH BLAH BLAH!

03:25.979 --> 03:27.649
I CAN'T EVEN HEAR YOU.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.852
IT'S JUST NOISE COMING OUT
OF AN UGLY SCIENTIST.

03:29.886 --> 03:32.190
UM, EVERYBODY,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:32.225 --> 03:35.162
A LITTLE BRAINSTORMING SESSION
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

03:35.197 --> 03:38.003
ENERGIZE.

03:38.036 --> 03:40.709
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
ENERGIZE ME?

03:40.741 --> 03:43.246
IF YOU,
PAMELA MORGAN BEESLY--

03:43.279 --> 03:44.749
DON'T, DON'T.

03:44.782 --> 03:45.918
IF YOU PROPOSE TO ME
DURING THE MICHAEL MEETING,

03:45.952 --> 03:47.186
I WILL SAY NO.

03:47.221 --> 03:49.727
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE,
'CAUSE I'M PROPOSING...

03:49.759 --> 03:51.194
THAT YOU GET ME
A CUP OF COFFEE,

03:51.229 --> 03:52.932
WHICH WOULD
ENERGIZE ME GREATLY

03:52.966 --> 03:54.902
AND MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST
MAN IN THE WORLD.

03:54.936 --> 03:57.074
EVERYBODY,
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO

03:57.107 --> 03:59.078
ENERGIZE OUR OFFICE?

03:59.111 --> 04:01.851
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING SINCE CHRISTMAS.

04:01.883 --> 04:05.089
PAM CLEARLY HAS JUST
GIVEN UP TRYING.

04:05.123 --> 04:07.829
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS WE TO GET THINGS GOING.

04:07.863 --> 04:09.164
WE NEED TO GET PERCOLATING
A LITTLE BIT.

04:09.197 --> 04:11.770
ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEAS
WHAT WE CAN DO?

04:11.804 --> 04:14.107
ANY SUGGESTIONS?
YES, ANDY?

04:14.140 --> 04:15.243
WHAT IF WE CHANGED

04:15.277 --> 04:18.183
OUR OUTGOING
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE

04:18.215 --> 04:20.120
SO IT JUST HAD
A LITTLE MORE ZING

04:20.152 --> 04:21.189
AND A LITTLE MORE PEP?

04:21.221 --> 04:22.826
ZING AND PEP.

04:22.858 --> 04:23.927
SEE, THAT'S--THOSE ARE
THE KIND OF WORDS

04:23.960 --> 04:24.929
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

04:24.962 --> 04:25.964
YES, JIM.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.000
WHAT ABOUT IF WE DID

04:27.034 --> 04:28.303
AN EVEN NEWER
VOICEMAIL MESSAGE

04:28.337 --> 04:30.107
THAT HAD EVEN MORE
ZING AND PEP?

04:30.140 --> 04:32.211
NOW WE'RE COOKING.
I LIKE THIS.

04:32.243 --> 04:34.882
MAYBE A WHOLE THEME.
LIKE A RAP--A RAP RHYME.

04:34.916 --> 04:36.119
KIND OF AN URBAN THING.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.154
AN URBAN--YEAH, STANLEY,

04:37.187 --> 04:39.091
YOU WANT TO HELP US OUT
WITH THAT?

04:39.125 --> 04:40.160
STANLEY!
EARTH TO STANLEY.

04:40.193 --> 04:42.097
NOT ME.
YES, YOU.

04:42.131 --> 04:43.835
COME ON, STANLEY,
PUT YOUR LITTLE GAME DOWN

04:43.867 --> 04:46.940
AND JOIN THE GROUP.
NO.

04:46.973 --> 04:48.944
STANLEY, WE'RE HAVING....
LEAVE ME ALONE, DAMN IT.

04:48.977 --> 04:50.180
WE'RE HAVING
A BRAINSTORM SESSION--

04:50.213 --> 04:52.184
[shouting]
DID I STUTTER?

04:57.828 --> 04:59.932
GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.601
I'M GOING TO GRAB
A GLASS OF WATER.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.252
CAN I TALK TO YOU
A SECOND?

05:10.286 --> 05:11.991
UGH...WHAT?

05:12.024 --> 05:15.664
UH, I REALLY THINK
THAT YOU NEED TO ADDRESS

05:15.699 --> 05:17.134
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH STANLEY THIS MORNING.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.138
[exhales]
WHAT ARE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT?

05:19.171 --> 05:20.675
NOTHING HAPPENED.

05:20.709 --> 05:23.146
WELL, YOU KNOW, STANLEY
WAS OPENLY INSUBORDINATE.

05:23.179 --> 05:26.352
THAT IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?
YEAH.

05:26.386 --> 05:29.258
WE WERE JOSHING AROUND,
THE TWO OF US.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.162
AND HE SAID,
"DID I STUTTER?"

05:31.195 --> 05:34.268
AND I SAID,
"WH-WH-WH-WHAT, DOG?"

05:34.301 --> 05:36.340
IT WAS JOKING, TOBY,
ALL RIGHT?

05:36.373 --> 05:39.178
HE DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE HE WAS JOKING.

05:39.211 --> 05:40.413
WELL, YOU DON'T GET IT,

05:40.448 --> 05:41.983
BECAUSE STANLEY IS
A BEAUTIFUL,

05:42.016 --> 05:44.356
SASSY, POWERFUL BLACK MAN,

05:44.389 --> 05:47.261
AND YOU'RE YOU.

05:47.294 --> 05:49.198
IF YOU HAD ANY FRIENDS,
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

05:49.231 --> 05:50.468
FRIENDS JOKE
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.072
"HEY, UM, YOU'RE POOR."

05:53.105 --> 05:54.777
"WELL, HEY,
YOUR MAMA'S DEAD."

05:54.810 --> 05:58.216
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

05:58.249 --> 05:59.787
IT'S--YOU'RE SO WHITE.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.123
ALL RIGHT.

06:02.157 --> 06:04.962
WELL, UM,
IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE

06:04.997 --> 06:07.333
THAT STANLEY WAS JOKING...
MM-HMM.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.038
WHY DON'T WE GO
ASK HIM THAT?

06:09.071 --> 06:11.042
OKAY, I WILL.

06:11.075 --> 06:13.178
I'M NOT FEELING VERY WELL
RIGHT NOW.

06:13.213 --> 06:16.486
MY STOMACH HURTS, SO I MAY
BE GOING HOME EARLY TODAY.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.424
YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,

06:18.456 --> 06:20.226
SOMETIMES MY DAUGHTER'S
STOMACH HURTS

06:20.260 --> 06:21.563
WHEN THERE'S
A MEAN GIRL AT SCHOOL.

06:21.595 --> 06:24.468
WELL, SOMETIMES
MY STOMACH HURTS

06:24.502 --> 06:27.173
WHEN YOU COME
INTO MY OFFICE.

06:27.206 --> 06:29.378
SO IT'S PROBABLY
PSYCHOLOGICAL.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.187
(Andy)
YOU MEET A LOT OF LADIES
DRIVING AN XTERRA,

06:34.220 --> 06:35.992
BECAUSE YOU PULL UP
TO A STOP LIGHT

06:36.024 --> 06:37.896
AND LOOK OVER AND THERE'S
AN XTERRA NEXT TO YOU,

06:37.929 --> 06:40.367
THEY'RE ALWAYS DRIVEN
BY CHICKS.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.170
SO THERE'S
YOUR ICE BREAKER.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.075
UNH!

06:44.107 --> 06:45.142
SCRATCH!

06:45.176 --> 06:46.345
THAT'S A RACING STRIPE.

06:46.379 --> 06:48.215
UH, BUMPER'S SAGGING.

06:48.248 --> 06:49.920
HMM, I DOUBT THAT
VERY MUCH.

06:49.953 --> 06:51.288
THIS CAR IS CRAP.

06:51.322 --> 06:52.926
I WILL BUY IT
FOR NEXT TO NOTHING.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.361
HOW NEXT TO?

06:54.395 --> 06:55.932
WELL, HERE ARE
YOUR OPTIONS.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.401
YOU CAN SELL IT FOR PARTS.

06:57.435 --> 06:58.604
DRIVE IT OFF A CLIFF.

06:58.636 --> 07:00.841
YOU CAN DONATE IT
TO A PERSON

07:00.841 --> 07:02.878
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
DIE IN A CAR CRASH.

07:02.913 --> 07:05.350
OR...YOU CAN SELL IT TO ME

07:05.383 --> 07:07.387
AND I'LL USE IT AS I WOULD
A WAGON ON MY FARM.

07:07.421 --> 07:09.290
IT WILL BE TOWED
BY A DONKEY.

07:09.325 --> 07:10.661
I HAVE TO PICK
ONE OF THOSE?

07:10.694 --> 07:13.065
YES.
CAN YOU GO OVER
THOSE OPTIONS AGAIN?

07:13.099 --> 07:13.935
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:13.967 --> 07:17.140
YOU KNOW $1,500
OFF THE PRICE RIGHT NOW

07:17.174 --> 07:18.308
AND I WILL TAKE IT
OFF YOUR HANDS.

07:18.342 --> 07:20.012
IT'S GONNA BE NOW.

07:20.047 --> 07:21.348
WELL, I HAVE THE BLUE BOOK
VALUE--
SEAL THE DEAL.

07:21.382 --> 07:23.318
LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO THIS THING.

07:23.352 --> 07:25.289
THREE, TWO, ONE.

07:25.322 --> 07:28.196
CAN I THINK ABOUT IT?
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, NOW.

07:28.228 --> 07:29.364
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.
NOW, NOW!

07:29.398 --> 07:31.402
SAY IT.
DO IT NOW.

07:31.435 --> 07:32.303
DO IT NOW!
I'M THINKING.

07:32.336 --> 07:33.607
DO IT.
SHAKE MY HAND.

07:33.639 --> 07:36.412
YOU WILL SELL ME THIS CAR.
SHAKE MY HAND.

07:36.445 --> 07:38.517
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

07:41.455 --> 07:43.995
WHAT?

07:44.028 --> 07:47.333
I, UH, SEE THAT YOU
GAVE ME THAT FORM

07:47.366 --> 07:49.738
THAT I ASKED YOU TO GIVE ME,
STANLEY THE MANLY.

07:49.771 --> 07:51.408
SO THANK YOU
FOR THAT.

07:51.442 --> 07:53.046
I GUESS WE ARE
BACK TO NORMAL.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.716
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:54.748 --> 07:56.384
WELL, YOU KNOW,

07:56.418 --> 07:58.123
THE THING THAT YOU SAID
EARLIER

07:58.156 --> 08:00.594
THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN.

08:00.628 --> 08:02.998
UM, AND THAT I
FORGIVE YOU FOR.

08:03.033 --> 08:04.367
THE WHOLE THING'S SILLY,
ISN'T IT?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.540
FRIENDS DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE

08:06.572 --> 08:08.376
TO FRIENDS AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED.

08:08.408 --> 08:09.478
SO WE ARE COOL.

08:09.511 --> 08:11.783
I AM NOT GOING
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.355
IT'S LIKE I USED TO TELL
MY WIFE.

08:14.388 --> 08:17.460
"I DO NOT APOLOGIZE
UNLESS I THINK I'M WRONG.

08:17.494 --> 08:19.430
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU CAN LEAVE."

08:19.464 --> 08:21.670
AND I SAY THE SAME THING
TO MY CURRENT WIFE,

08:21.702 --> 08:24.207
AND I'LL SAY IT
TO MY NEXT ONE TOO.

08:24.241 --> 08:27.247
JIM IS IN CHARGE OF STANLEY
ONLY IN SALES-RELATED MATTERS.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.586
HENCE THE GREEN LINE.
GREEN FOR MONEY.

08:29.619 --> 08:31.623
SALES, GET IT?
UH-HUH.

08:31.655 --> 08:33.527
THERE IS THIS YELLOW ZIGZAG
THAT DOES GIVE RYAN

08:33.560 --> 08:34.796
THE AUTHORITY
TO DISCIPLINE STANLEY.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.099
GREAT.

08:36.132 --> 08:37.167
HOWEVER, IN SO DOING.

08:37.201 --> 08:39.138
IT ZIGS PAST YOUR NAME,

08:39.171 --> 08:40.372
HENCE ZAGGING YOU

08:40.406 --> 08:42.177
AND MAKING YOU
APPEAR WEAK.

08:42.211 --> 08:44.414
THUS THE YELLOW COLOR.
YELLOW FOR COWARDLY.

08:44.447 --> 08:45.449
WHAT'S THE PINK?

08:45.482 --> 08:47.555
MENSTRUAL CYCLES.

08:47.588 --> 08:49.390
OKAY.

08:49.424 --> 08:52.530
IS THERE ANYBODY UP HERE,
ANYBODY AT ALL

08:52.565 --> 08:53.700
THAT CAN DEAL WITH THIS
OTHER THAN ME--

08:53.734 --> 08:56.504
YOU.

08:56.539 --> 08:59.211
WELL, THERE IS THE EMERGENCY
DISASTER MODE

08:59.245 --> 09:00.681
FOR THE ORG CHART.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.517
THIS GIVES ME

09:02.552 --> 09:04.589
FULL AUTHORITY

09:04.621 --> 09:06.559
OVER EVERY SINGLE PERSON
IN THE OFFICE.

09:06.593 --> 09:08.129
I NEVER SAID
YOU COULD DO THAT.

09:08.163 --> 09:09.364
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SAY IT.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.201
JUST SAY IT.
OKAY, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

09:11.234 --> 09:12.737
SAY IT.
JUST DO IT.

09:12.771 --> 09:14.875
DON'T THINK, SAY IT.
DO IT.

09:14.909 --> 09:17.782
FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO.

09:17.814 --> 09:18.816
DO IT.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.155
GIVE ME CONTROL.

09:21.189 --> 09:24.460
MICHAEL...

09:24.495 --> 09:26.432
[whispering]
I PROMISING TO GIVE
AUTHORITY BACK TO YOU

09:26.464 --> 09:28.436
WHEN THIS CRISIS
IS OVER.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.274
DO IT, MICHAEL.

09:31.309 --> 09:35.516
DO IT.
HEY.

09:35.549 --> 09:37.755
THIS OFFICE NEEDS
A STRONG MAN.

09:37.788 --> 09:40.694
SAY IT.

09:40.728 --> 09:43.767
NO.
SO--

09:43.800 --> 09:45.771
ALL RIGHT, WELL THEN

09:45.804 --> 09:47.473
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THIS YOURSELF.

09:47.506 --> 09:49.211
[door opens]

09:53.418 --> 09:54.988
HEY, PAM.

09:55.021 --> 09:56.860
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR GLASSES.

09:56.893 --> 09:59.398
OH, THANKS.

09:59.430 --> 10:00.834
ALL THE GIRLFRIENDS
THAT I'VE EVER HAD

10:00.868 --> 10:01.201
HAVE WORN GLASSES.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.940
OH, OKAY.

10:03.973 --> 10:06.412
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF A TURN-ON
FOR ME ACTUALLY.

10:06.444 --> 10:08.750
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO...
LIKE LIBRARIANS.

10:08.784 --> 10:10.688
ENTERING THE--

10:10.721 --> 10:13.727
COULD YOU JUST SAY, "THESE ARE
DUE BACK THURSDAY."

10:13.759 --> 10:15.429
NO.

10:22.043 --> 10:24.247
[rings]

10:27.487 --> 10:29.057
DUNDER MIFFLIN.
THIS IS PAM.

10:29.089 --> 10:31.461
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.504
A LOT OF JAZZ CATS
ARE BLIND,

10:36.539 --> 10:39.779
BUT THEY CAN PLAY THE PIANO
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

10:39.812 --> 10:42.484
I'D LIKE TO PUT THE PIANO
IN FRONT OF PAM

10:42.516 --> 10:45.490
WITHOUT HER GLASSES
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

10:45.522 --> 10:47.060
I'D ALSO LIKE
TO SEE HER TOPLESS.

10:51.669 --> 10:52.972
MIKE.
HEY.

10:53.005 --> 10:54.475
I'M VERY BUSY HERE, MAN.

10:54.508 --> 10:56.011
DARRYL--AHEM.

10:56.043 --> 10:58.449
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A GANG?

10:58.483 --> 10:59.718
WHY?

10:59.751 --> 11:02.491
IT'S AN ADVICE QUESTION.

11:02.523 --> 11:03.894
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

11:03.927 --> 11:04.929
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

11:04.962 --> 11:06.733
IT'S, UM--
NO, NO, NO.

11:06.765 --> 11:08.134
I KNOW
IT'S VERY PERSONAL.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.975
NO, UM...I HAVE.

11:12.009 --> 11:13.011
I KNEW IT.

11:13.044 --> 11:14.682
OKAY.

11:14.716 --> 11:15.950
WHO ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE?

11:15.983 --> 11:17.387
CRIPS, BLOODS?

11:17.421 --> 11:18.423
BOTH.

11:18.456 --> 11:19.658
GOD.

11:19.691 --> 11:21.529
YEAH, THEM
AND THE LATIN KINGS.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.032
THE WARRIORS.

11:23.064 --> 11:24.167
OKAY.
NEWSIES.

11:24.199 --> 11:27.774
OKAY, SO DIG THIS.

11:27.807 --> 11:29.478
YOU'RE ON THE STREET

11:29.510 --> 11:31.080
AND ONE OF YOUR GANG
DISSES YOU.

11:31.114 --> 11:33.185
OH, MY GOODNESS.
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:33.217 --> 11:35.056
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
TO GET HIM TO MAKE IT RIGHT?

11:35.089 --> 11:37.661
WELL, SEE, UM,

11:37.693 --> 11:39.966
IN THE GANG WORLD
WE USE SOMETHING

11:39.999 --> 11:41.133
CALLED FLUFFY FINGERS.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.172
WHAT IS THAT?

11:43.204 --> 11:46.512
THAT'S WHERE IF SOMEBODY
REALLY GETS IN YOUR FACE,

11:46.545 --> 11:49.084
YOU KNOW, JUST
START TICKLING THEM.

11:51.789 --> 11:53.493
REALLY?
YEAH.

11:53.526 --> 11:54.996
AND HE STARTS TICKLING YOU.

11:55.029 --> 11:57.935
YOU KNOW, PRETTY SOON
YOU'RE LAUGHING AND HUGGING.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.104
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

11:59.137 --> 12:00.139
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THE WHOLE THING.

12:00.171 --> 12:01.441
Y'ALL CAN JUST GO
TO CHURCH TOGETHER

12:01.441 --> 12:03.612
AND GET AN ICE CREAM CONE.

12:03.646 --> 12:05.883
I WOULD HAVE NEVER

12:05.917 --> 12:09.624
THOUGHT THAT GANGS WOULD BE
TICKLING EACH OTHER.

12:09.657 --> 12:12.196
WELL, IT'S EFFECTIVE.

12:21.582 --> 12:22.985
I THINK
IT'S SELF-EXPLANATORY.

12:23.018 --> 12:26.659
HEY, JIM!
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

12:26.691 --> 12:28.628
CAN YOU ANSWER ME SOMETHING
AS A TRUE EAGLES FAN?

12:28.663 --> 12:30.131
OH, BOY.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.036
HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH A FRANCHISE THIS BAD?

12:32.070 --> 12:34.641
ON A WING
AND A PRAYER MOSTLY.

12:34.675 --> 12:36.144
ALL RIGHT,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

12:36.178 --> 12:38.082
LISTEN, WHILE I HAVE YOU
HERE WITH TOBY,

12:38.115 --> 12:39.117
I NEED TO GIVE YOU
A FORMAL WARNING

12:39.150 --> 12:40.286
ABOUT YOUR JOB PERFORMANCE.

12:40.318 --> 12:43.158
[chuckling]
A FORMAL WARNING.

12:43.192 --> 12:45.196
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A JOKE.

12:45.229 --> 12:46.330
I KNOW HOW YOU SPEND
YOUR TIME HERE.

12:46.363 --> 12:49.037
I KNOW HOW LITTLE
YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR JOB.

12:49.070 --> 12:51.308
AND HONESTLY, IF YOU SPENT
AS MUCH TIME SELLING

12:51.340 --> 12:53.045
AS YOU DO GOOFING AROUND
WITH DWIGHT

12:53.078 --> 12:54.314
AND HANGING OUT AT RECEPTION

12:54.346 --> 12:57.153
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

12:57.186 --> 12:58.989
I'M SORRY,
IS THIS BECAUSE

12:59.023 --> 13:00.993
I TALKED TO WALLACE
ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE?

13:01.027 --> 13:02.998
BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T
MEAN TO GO OVER YOUR HEAD.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.302
THIS IS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT, ALL RIGHT?

13:05.335 --> 13:07.607
I ALWAYS APPRECIATE
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

13:07.641 --> 13:09.110
ABOUT MY JOB PERFORMANCE.

13:09.144 --> 13:10.345
I THRIVE ON IT.

13:10.379 --> 13:12.750
I'M SORRY, THEN DO YOU MIND
EXPLAINING IT A LITTLE BETTER?

13:12.783 --> 13:13.653
'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S REALLY--

13:13.685 --> 13:16.123
WHOA, DON'T GET
ALL DEFENSIVE, ALL RIGHT?

13:16.158 --> 13:18.195
IT'S JUST A WARNING.

13:18.227 --> 13:19.966
IF YOU WANT THE DETAILS,
TOBY CAN PROVIDE THEM.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.168
YOU TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.905
I'D SAY
ALL THE GOOFING AROUND

13:22.937 --> 13:24.207
AT PAM'S DESK

13:24.239 --> 13:26.679
AND HANGING OUT WITH PAM

13:26.712 --> 13:29.150
HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP
TO HIM.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.255
P-P--WITH PAM.

13:35.129 --> 13:37.767
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID RYAN WANT?

13:37.801 --> 13:39.204
OH, WE WERE JUST

13:39.237 --> 13:41.975
TALKING ABOUT
BUREAUCRATIC STUFF.

13:42.009 --> 13:43.713
BECAUSE YOU'RE
VERY IMPORTANT.

13:43.746 --> 13:45.683
YEAH.

13:50.827 --> 13:54.200
[Dwight scatting]

13:54.234 --> 13:55.770
(Dwight)
OH, WHAT'S DWIGHT UP TO?

13:55.803 --> 13:56.940
OH, PROBABLY NOTHING.

13:56.972 --> 14:01.147
[dramatic scatting]

14:01.181 --> 14:03.986
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

14:06.357 --> 14:07.895
YOU'RE FLIPPING
MY CAR FOR PROFIT.

14:07.927 --> 14:09.264
IT'S MY CAR NOW.

14:09.296 --> 14:12.170
I GAVE YOU A DEAL

14:12.203 --> 14:13.973
BASED ON WHAT
YOU SAID TO ME.

14:14.007 --> 14:16.310
YEAH, WELL...

14:16.343 --> 14:17.747
SELLER BEWARE.

14:17.781 --> 14:19.284
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT TO MONITOR

14:19.317 --> 14:22.256
A THREE-WAY BIDDING WAR
FOR MY CAR ON eBAY.

14:24.126 --> 14:26.398
I'VE GOT A MAD LIB FOR YOU.

14:26.430 --> 14:32.442
"A STUPID IDIOTIC NUMBSKULL
NAMED ANDY BERNARD

14:32.476 --> 14:34.949
"SOLD HIS XTERRA

14:34.981 --> 14:38.924
"TO A SMART AND CAPABLE MAN
NAMED DWIGHT.

14:38.957 --> 14:43.197
THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE
AN AWESOME DAY FOR DWIGHT."

14:55.021 --> 14:58.428
OKAY, EVERYBODY, SHH!
LISTEN UP.

14:58.462 --> 15:01.233
EARLIER TODAY,
STANLEY SASSED ME.

15:01.267 --> 15:01.801
AND TOBY GAVE ME
SOME SUGGESTIONS

15:01.801 --> 15:04.507
ON HOW TO DISCIPLINE HIM.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.080
THEY DID NOT WORK, OBVIOUSLY,
BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID.

15:07.112 --> 15:10.953
SO I AM NOW GOING
TO FAKE FIRE HIM.

15:10.987 --> 15:12.957
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:12.991 --> 15:14.627
IT'S LIKE A MOCK EXECUTION.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.164
[whispering]
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

15:16.198 --> 15:17.166
YES, IT IS
A GOOD IDEA.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.303
IT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE
SOLUTION I HAVE LEFT.

15:19.337 --> 15:21.074
WELL, YOU CAN
ACTUALLY FIRE HIM.

15:21.107 --> 15:22.410
NO--UGH.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.380
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

15:24.414 --> 15:25.382
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US THIS?

15:25.416 --> 15:26.953
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO BEHAVE

15:26.985 --> 15:29.424
AS IF I'M ACTUALLY
FIRING HIM, OSCAR, OKAY?

15:29.457 --> 15:31.594
MICHAEL, IF YOU HADN'T
TOLD US THIS,

15:31.627 --> 15:32.997
THEN HE WOULD'VE THOUGHT

15:33.032 --> 15:34.367
THAT YOU WERE
ACTUALLY FIRING HIM.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.270
I'M NOT FIRING HIM!
I'M NOT--

15:36.303 --> 15:38.944
I WILL NEED YOU TO ACT
LIKE I AM FIRING HIM.

15:38.977 --> 15:40.412
JUST--WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

15:40.446 --> 15:43.418
IS I'M GOING TO PRETEND
THAT I'M FIRING HIM.

15:43.452 --> 15:46.223
AND I NEED YOU TO ACT
LIKE I AM FIRING HIM.

15:46.257 --> 15:47.593
DO YOU GET THAT?
DO YOU GET IT?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.263
I'M TEACHING HIM A LESSON.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.331
HE NEEDS TO LEARN HUMILITY.

15:50.365 --> 15:52.003
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL I'M--

15:52.036 --> 15:53.137
OKAY, HERE HE COMES.

15:53.172 --> 15:54.540
LET'S JUST PLAY ACT.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.247
STANLEY, MAY I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:05.361 --> 16:09.536
STANLEY HUDSON,
YOU ARE FIRED.

16:15.682 --> 16:17.988
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

16:18.022 --> 16:20.358
I AM SERIOUS.

16:20.391 --> 16:21.761
WE ARE ALL SERIOUS.

16:21.793 --> 16:24.399
YOU ARE FIRED
LIKE A HEART ATTACK.

16:24.433 --> 16:28.142
YOU'RE FIRING ME
OVER THREE WORDS?
YES.

16:28.174 --> 16:29.544
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

16:29.577 --> 16:33.718
DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA
LET YOU DO THIS TO ME?
HMM.

16:33.751 --> 16:36.691
I'VE WATCHED YOU SCREW UP
THIS OFFICE FOR TEN YEARS,

16:36.723 --> 16:38.262
AND I'M FILING A LAWSUIT,

16:38.294 --> 16:39.664
AND I'M GONNA TELL THEM
ABOUT EVERY STUPID THING

16:39.697 --> 16:41.168
YOU'VE EVER DONE UP
IN THIS OFFICE.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.435
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
OKAY.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.737
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:43.772 --> 16:46.211
NOW YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

16:46.243 --> 16:48.048
THIS WAS A FAKE FIRING.

16:48.082 --> 16:49.816
LESSON LEARNED.

16:49.849 --> 16:52.623
GOOD WORK, EVERYBODY.
VERY NICE.

16:52.656 --> 16:53.725
SO I'M NOT FIRED.

16:53.757 --> 16:56.098
[exhales]
THAT'S IT.

16:56.131 --> 16:59.670
AND, UH, DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME?

16:59.704 --> 17:02.042
OH, YES, I DO.

17:02.042 --> 17:06.451
YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR DAMN
LITTLE PEA-SIZED MIND.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.753
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

17:07.785 --> 17:10.091
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SENSE AT ALL?
OKAY.

17:10.126 --> 17:13.164
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW TO RUN AN OFFICE?
YES.

17:13.197 --> 17:14.367
EVERY DAY YOU DO
SOMETHING STUPIDER

17:14.400 --> 17:16.804
THAN YOU DID THE DAY BEFORE.
THAT'S NOT--

17:16.837 --> 17:18.774
AND I THINK, "THERE'S
NO POSSIBLE WAY...
ALL RIGHT.

17:18.808 --> 17:20.179
HE CAN TOP THAT."
OKAY.

17:20.211 --> 17:21.513
BUT YOU DO YOU DO?

17:21.547 --> 17:22.849
YOU FIND A WAY, DAMN IT,
TO TOP IT.

17:22.883 --> 17:24.454
YOU ARE
A PROFESSIONAL IDIOT--

17:24.486 --> 17:27.460
HEY, STOP IT!

17:27.492 --> 17:28.895
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT.

17:28.927 --> 17:30.132
(Jim)
WHO?

17:30.166 --> 17:31.800
YEAH, EVERYBODY
EXCEPT STANLEY.

17:38.847 --> 17:40.386
LET'S GO.

17:40.418 --> 17:41.754
I CAN'T FIND MY GLASSES.

17:41.788 --> 17:42.690
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:42.723 --> 17:44.727
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MY HAND
AND LEAVE 'EM

17:44.760 --> 17:46.798
AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
OKAY, OKAY.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.706
[chuckling]

17:50.739 --> 17:52.710
IT'S MICHAEL
VERSUS STANLEY,

17:52.743 --> 17:55.182
AND IT IS THE CLASH
OF THE TITANS.

17:55.216 --> 17:57.186
IN ONE CORNER,
YOU HAVE MICHAEL,

17:57.220 --> 17:59.389
AND HE IS MAD.

17:59.424 --> 18:01.593
AND THEN IN THE OTHER CORNER,
YOU HAVE STANLEY,

18:01.627 --> 18:04.199
AND HE'S MAD.

18:04.234 --> 18:07.206
SO THAT'S ABOUT IT.

18:26.444 --> 18:28.582
[sobbing]
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU KEEP PICKING ON ME.

18:28.614 --> 18:29.817
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

18:29.849 --> 18:32.555
YOU JUST...DO,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.595
SO...PLEASE HELP ME
UNDERSTAND.

18:35.628 --> 18:37.532
FINE.
HERE IT IS.

18:37.565 --> 18:41.441
YOU ARE A PERSON
I DO NOT RESPECT.

18:41.473 --> 18:43.278
THE THINGS YOU SAY,
YOUR ACTIONS,

18:43.312 --> 18:44.747
YOUR METHODS AND STYLE.

18:44.780 --> 18:45.816
EVERYTHING YOU WOULD DO,

18:45.849 --> 18:48.020
I WOULD DO IT
THE OPPOSITE WAY.

18:51.961 --> 18:55.701
WELL, STANLEY,
MAYBE YOU ARE FEELING

18:55.735 --> 18:56.971
THAT YOU DON'T RESPECT ME

18:57.003 --> 18:58.308
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ME
VERY WELL.

18:58.342 --> 19:01.881
MICHAEL, I'VE KNOW YOU
A VERY LONG TIME.

19:01.914 --> 19:03.817
AND THE MORE I'VE GOTTEN
TO KNOW YOU,

19:03.852 --> 19:05.889
THE LESS I'VE COME
TO RESPECT YOU.

19:05.922 --> 19:08.928
ANY OTHER THEORIES?

19:14.774 --> 19:17.512
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T
RESPECT ME.

19:17.546 --> 19:20.819
I ACCEPT THAT.

19:20.852 --> 19:22.955
BUT LISTEN TO ME.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.062
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME
THAT WAY IN THIS OFFICE.

19:26.095 --> 19:29.870
YOU JUST CAN'T.
I AM YOUR BOSS.

19:29.904 --> 19:30.971
CAN'T ALLOW IT.

19:31.006 --> 19:34.078
FAIR ENOUGH.

19:39.857 --> 19:41.628
(Michael)
I AM A GOOD PERSON,

19:41.660 --> 19:45.735
AND SOMETIMES GOOD PEOPLE
DON'T GET NO RESPECT.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.841
RODNEY DANGERFIELD.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.079
[imitating Rodney Dangerfield]
HEY, I DON'T NO RESPECT.

19:51.111 --> 19:53.083
NO RESPECT AT ALL.

19:53.115 --> 19:57.593
WHEN I WAS IN THE SANDBOX
AS A KID, I GOT NO RESPECT.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.532
MY WIFE LIKES TO TALK
AFTER SEX.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.402
SO SHE CALLED ME
FROM A HOTEL ROOM,

20:02.402 --> 20:04.839
SAID, "I DON'T RESPECT YOU."

20:04.874 --> 20:08.815
AHH, THOUGHTLESS.

20:08.847 --> 20:11.687
AW, YOU KNOW WHAT DON'T
GET NO RESPECT?

20:11.721 --> 20:13.524
AIRPLANE FOOD.

20:13.557 --> 20:15.026
WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE
THE PLANE

20:15.059 --> 20:17.197
OUT OF THE AIRLINE FOOD?

20:20.104 --> 20:22.743
MY WIFE DON'T GET
NO RESPECT.

20:22.775 --> 20:27.118
SOME--TAKE HER, PLEASE,
FOR EXAMPLE.

20:27.150 --> 20:29.087
[imitating Jeff Foxworthy]
IF YOU DON'T GET NO RESPECT,

20:29.122 --> 20:31.961
YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK.

20:31.994 --> 20:35.134
[imitating Borat]
RESPECT IS NICE.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.738
BORAT.

20:39.275 --> 20:42.249
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH GRAPE NUTS?

20:42.281 --> 20:45.087
NO GRAPES, NO NUTS.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.124
I DON'T GET NO RESPECT.

20:48.794 --> 20:50.798
SO I'M THINKING
AS A REWARD

20:50.831 --> 20:52.101
FOR OUR LOYAL CLIENTS

20:52.134 --> 20:54.640
THAT WE CONTACT
THEIR ASSISTANTS

20:54.674 --> 20:56.109
AND WE FIND OUT
WHERE THEY LIVE.

20:56.142 --> 20:59.182
AND THEN WE GO
TO THEIR HOUSES

20:59.215 --> 21:01.588
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER
AND GO CAROLING.

21:01.621 --> 21:04.793
IT IS A SUMMER CHRISTMAS
SALE-A-BRATION.

21:04.826 --> 21:09.102
AND WE CALL IT
A SUMMER-SALES-A-LOT.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.973
FEEDBACK?
ANYBODY? STANLEY?

21:12.008 --> 21:16.016
HAS POTENTIAL TO BE
YOUR BEST IDEA YET.

21:18.219 --> 21:19.590
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

21:19.624 --> 21:21.092
[exhales]
DAMN IT.

21:21.126 --> 21:24.132
SORRY, EVERYBODY OUT
EXCEPT PHYLLIS.
