01:39.009 --> 01:40.801
Andrea.

01:57.870 --> 01:59.068
Andrea?

01:59.247 --> 02:02.949
Brandon, why is everybody
staring at me? l mean, what's wrong?

02:03.170 --> 02:06.421
- Didn't you forget something?
- No, l...

02:07.176 --> 02:11.127
Oh, my God. l forgot my clothes.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.917
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

02:58.086 --> 02:59.497
Just remember that.

03:00.507 --> 03:02.465
l'll think about it.

03:03.803 --> 03:05.297
Andrea, you know how you said

03:05.472 --> 03:07.880
l should enter the Times High School
Journalism Competition?

03:08.060 --> 03:09.305
Yeah.

03:09.938 --> 03:12.015
Did you win?

03:12.191 --> 03:14.813
- No, l didn't enter.
- Why not?

03:14.987 --> 03:19.283
Well, l started thinking about that
food service expose that you wrote.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.694
''The Underbelly
of Cafeteria Cuisine''?

03:21.872 --> 03:26.334
Yeah. You going undercover
was inspirational.

03:26.504 --> 03:29.589
And who would've thought
l'd look so good in a hairnet, huh?

03:29.843 --> 03:32.715
lt doesn't matter though.
l don't enter those contests.

03:32.889 --> 03:35.048
Well, not until now.

03:37.229 --> 03:40.065
- What do you mean?
- l mean, l sent your article in for you.

03:41.527 --> 03:43.354
Are you trying to get me
kicked out of school?

03:44.031 --> 03:46.737
Well, l just think
you deserve a little credit.

03:46.952 --> 03:49.241
Brandon, do you realise
that l could be expelled

03:49.414 --> 03:51.407
if somebody finds out
l live outside of district?

03:51.584 --> 03:53.826
Andrea,
give me some credit here, okay?

03:54.004 --> 03:56.330
l used your grandmother's address.

03:58.761 --> 04:01.514
Besides,
if they didn't call you by now,

04:01.682 --> 04:04.008
it's probably a pretty safe bet
you didn't win anyway.

04:04.186 --> 04:07.104
So, you know, it's a dead issue.
Okay, you happy, huh?

04:07.274 --> 04:12.021
So you really liked my article, huh?

04:13.450 --> 04:15.158
Yeah, it was okay.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.906
So can l get you anything else?
Another soda?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.661
- Something to eat maybe?
- No, thanks.

04:20.836 --> 04:22.628
- l'm just waiting for somebody.
- Okay.

04:22.798 --> 04:27.545
- Brandon, can l get some change?
- Yeah, sure, chief. Right here.

04:28.890 --> 04:33.055
- Here you go, pal. Feed that jukebox.
- Hey, l'm singing your song, babe.

04:33.397 --> 04:36.352
Excuse me,
are you sure there's no messages?

04:36.527 --> 04:41.820
My darling, nobody has called asking
for a beautiful lady named Christine.

04:41.993 --> 04:44.567
And that nobody
ought to have his head examined.

04:44.747 --> 04:47.453
Well, l'm gonna give him
one more song and that's it.

04:47.627 --> 04:49.252
Yeah.

04:54.763 --> 04:56.922
Are you buying
or just window-shopping?

04:57.141 --> 04:58.933
Well, be my guest. After you.

04:59.144 --> 05:02.099
How gallant of you. Thank you, sir.

05:05.696 --> 05:06.727
Ace pick.

05:07.615 --> 05:10.368
Well, then we must be
on the same wavelength.

05:11.496 --> 05:14.783
l haven't seen you around here before.
l would've remembered, believe me.

05:15.002 --> 05:17.328
- What's your name?
- Christine.

05:17.505 --> 05:19.961
- l'm--
- You're Steve, l know.

05:20.176 --> 05:22.668
Well, l heard your friends talking.

05:22.930 --> 05:26.051
Oh, well,
you go to Beverly Hills High?

05:26.602 --> 05:28.595
No, l go to North Culver.
How about you?

05:28.814 --> 05:32.350
- West Beverly.
- That's where all the cool people go.

05:32.528 --> 05:34.402
Well, hey, if you've got it,
flaunt it, right?

05:34.573 --> 05:37.575
- Yeah.
- Well, what's the matter?

05:37.744 --> 05:41.328
Well, my ride didn't show up and
l don't know how l'm gonna get home.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.374
Oh, that's easy enough.
l can give you a ride.

05:43.545 --> 05:45.503
- You can?
- Absolutely.

05:45.673 --> 05:47.999
That takes care of that crisis.
Anything else?

05:48.177 --> 05:50.419
Yes. l'm starving.

05:50.597 --> 05:53.136
Why don't l buy you something to eat
to thank you for the ride?

05:53.977 --> 05:56.017
- You want to pay for me?
- Yeah.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.600
Well, that's a switch.

05:57.775 --> 06:01.062
Oh, no, you know what?
Maybe l better give you a rain cheque.

06:01.238 --> 06:03.908
- lt's getting kind of late for me.
- What's the rush?

06:04.117 --> 06:07.285
l'm addicted to reruns
of The Hartley House.

06:07.456 --> 06:09.533
l never miss it.

06:10.586 --> 06:12.246
Me neither.

06:17.429 --> 06:20.597
l can't believe Samantha Sanders
is your mother.

06:20.768 --> 06:23.604
She was, like,
America's favourite mom.

06:23.856 --> 06:27.392
- l'm sorry she's out of town.
- Well, l'm not.

06:30.115 --> 06:32.274
Well, l just meant
l would've liked to have met her.

06:32.452 --> 06:34.778
Well, you still may get a chance.

06:35.832 --> 06:39.997
You know, she's got really good taste.
She decorates your house really nice.

06:40.172 --> 06:44.883
Christine, do you really
wanna talk about my mom?

06:47.349 --> 06:49.638
l guess l'm a little nervous.

06:49.811 --> 06:51.769
You're so pretty.

06:53.943 --> 07:00.280
Steve, you know, l don't usually do this
with somebody l just met, but...

07:00.453 --> 07:01.995
But what?

07:04.083 --> 07:07.287
Somehow, l feel like
l know you already.

07:22.235 --> 07:23.895
Brandon, l need to talk to you
for a sec--

07:24.072 --> 07:26.646
There you are.
Andrea, congratulations are in order.

07:26.867 --> 07:27.898
Thank you.

07:28.078 --> 07:30.404
l'm sure l speak on behalf
of the entire faculty and staff

07:30.581 --> 07:33.583
when l say we're all just thrilled that
you've won the Times Competition.

07:33.795 --> 07:36.334
- Hey, that's great. Congratulations.
- Yeah.

07:36.507 --> 07:38.299
Now the district
Public Relations office

07:38.468 --> 07:41.386
will send their Mr. Kramer
over to your house this afternoon.

07:41.556 --> 07:42.801
My house?

07:43.017 --> 07:45.805
They need background info
for a profile on you for the newsletter.

07:46.021 --> 07:48.939
Ms. Teasley, really, you don't need
to make such a big fuss about this.

07:49.109 --> 07:50.188
Don't be so modest, Andrea.

07:50.361 --> 07:53.114
And don't worry about it.
lt's just a little front-page puff piece.

07:53.282 --> 07:55.988
Mr. Kramer will take some photos,
talk to your parents, that's all.

07:56.203 --> 07:57.662
You mean her grandmother.

07:57.831 --> 08:01.367
Of course, right.
Well, congratulations again.

08:05.134 --> 08:10.094
- Are you all right, chief?
- l just... l can't breathe that well.

08:10.266 --> 08:12.508
Don't worry, it's just an interview.
You can handle him.

08:12.687 --> 08:15.095
You don't understand.
He's gonna talk to my grandmother.

08:15.274 --> 08:16.353
So?

08:16.526 --> 08:20.477
So, so, you don't know
my grandmother.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.916
How can l call you first if you weren't
even home to answer the phone?

08:28.085 --> 08:32.333
l just went for some refreshments.
Maybe Brockton would like something.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.466
lt's Brandon, Brandon Walsh.

08:34.636 --> 08:38.339
Excuse me. l didn't think
it was Brandon Mendelbaum.

08:38.558 --> 08:39.840
Grandma Rose, listen--

08:40.020 --> 08:43.307
l bought health food cookies,
oat bran.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.770
No preservatives, no cholesterol.

08:47.114 --> 08:50.780
No refined sugar, no taste.

08:50.995 --> 08:53.867
- But you can't have everything.
- l need to talk to you for a minute.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.412
- Coming!
- Want me to stall him?

08:56.586 --> 09:00.170
- No, you better let me explain.
- Explain what?

09:00.342 --> 09:02.419
Grandma, my whole life
may hang in the balance here.

09:02.595 --> 09:05.597
- You've gotta listen to me.
- Could we open the door?

09:05.767 --> 09:07.226
- Rose?
- Yeah.

09:07.394 --> 09:09.102
- Are you all right, Rose?
- Yes, l'm fine.

09:09.272 --> 09:11.312
- Open the door.
- What's going on in there? Why--?

09:11.484 --> 09:17.276
Andrea. She's all grown up already.
l can't believe it.

09:17.451 --> 09:20.655
And she's got
such a nice little figure now.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.539
Aunt Evelyn.

09:24.086 --> 09:26.958
Let me see those nails, sweetheart.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.503
Aunt Muriel. What a surprise.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.795
What surprise?

09:31.973 --> 09:34.809
We've been playing Kalooki every
Thursday since before you were born.

09:34.978 --> 09:36.888
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to your boyfriend?

09:37.106 --> 09:39.680
Rose, your granddaughter
has such good taste.

09:39.902 --> 09:43.189
Girls, this is Mr. Bramford Walsh.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.073
His name is Brandon.
He's not my boyfriend.

09:45.243 --> 09:47.117
- Can l talk to you for a moment?
- Certainly.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.537
Excuse me. Make yourself at home.

09:49.708 --> 09:53.754
Someone's coming over any minute to
interview me and take some pictures.

09:53.923 --> 09:56.165
That's wonderful. For a job, darling?

09:56.385 --> 09:59.921
No, this article l wrote,
it won a journalism award.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.729
Oh, darling. That's so wonderful.

10:04.898 --> 10:06.440
They'll give you a plaque
or something?

10:06.609 --> 10:08.768
l don't know, Grandma,
but when Mr. Kramer comes,

10:08.946 --> 10:12.233
we have to give him the impression
that l do live here.

10:12.409 --> 10:14.034
But you don't live here.

10:14.245 --> 10:15.870
l know, but you remember
when you said

10:16.040 --> 10:19.077
that l could use your address
for school, that it would be okay?

10:19.253 --> 10:22.706
And what did l say?
l said, as long as l wasn't involved.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.589
Well, now you just have to be
slightly involved.

10:25.763 --> 10:29.098
There is no such thing.
That's like being a little bit pregnant.

10:29.268 --> 10:30.976
Grandma,
can't you just pretend there is?

10:31.146 --> 10:35.311
Look, if get expelled, it could ruin
everything that l've worked for.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.609
So, what?
This person's here to question me?

10:38.782 --> 10:40.941
No, he might not even
talk to you that much.

10:41.119 --> 10:43.611
But if he does, l wanna make
sure we have our facts straight.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.949
Our facts straight.
You don't want our facts straight.

10:46.127 --> 10:47.621
You want the made-up story straight.

10:47.796 --> 10:50.881
l mean, like if he wants to know how
long l've been living here or anything.

10:51.051 --> 10:55.466
Andrea, darling,
l'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be.

10:55.641 --> 10:58.678
lf he comes here to interview you,
that's fine with me.

10:58.854 --> 11:01.891
l'm gonna keep my mouth closed,
l'll play Kalooki.

11:02.068 --> 11:05.604
But if he asks me a direct question,

11:05.782 --> 11:09.448
l'm sorry if you're gonna be expelled,

11:09.621 --> 11:13.490
but l am not going to lie.

11:16.673 --> 11:19.461
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

11:19.678 --> 11:25.600
You know, Andrea, you have very--
What shall l say? --mature taste.

11:25.812 --> 11:28.138
Why?
Because l like porcelain and silver?

11:28.316 --> 11:30.060
Classics never go out of style.

11:31.654 --> 11:34.276
So, you sleep on this couch, huh?

11:34.450 --> 11:37.156
Yes, it's really comfortable.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.455
Does it fold out?

11:40.668 --> 11:42.578
- Yes.
- No.

11:46.343 --> 11:49.678
lt depends on your definition of ''fold.''

11:52.602 --> 11:54.476
Well, l won't keep you.

11:54.689 --> 11:57.810
Mr. Kramer, you know
what you should put in your profile?

11:58.361 --> 12:02.277
That Andrea is a pleasure to be
around, not like some kids.

12:02.451 --> 12:06.367
ln fact, on most days, you wouldn't
even think a teenager lived here.

12:06.582 --> 12:08.824
Mr. Kramer, l'll walk you out.

12:09.002 --> 12:10.876
- lt was nice meeting you.
- Same here.

12:11.047 --> 12:12.874
So long, ladies.

12:17.223 --> 12:19.133
Grandma, don't you want
what's best for me?

12:20.019 --> 12:22.593
Not if it means
schlepping on a bus for hours,

12:22.773 --> 12:28.018
breathing exhaust fumes for
the privilege of cavorting with rich kids.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.619
l can't believe
l have to defend myself to you.

12:31.787 --> 12:33.780
Aren't you on my side?

12:33.956 --> 12:36.993
Against who? Your conscience?

12:37.170 --> 12:42.297
Grandma, l don't like lying either, but
sometimes the ends justify the means.

12:42.469 --> 12:44.213
This is one of those times.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.883
Maybe to you, it is.

12:46.684 --> 12:51.348
When you were my age,
you assumed a different identity.

12:52.025 --> 12:56.274
My sweetheart,
when l was your age,

12:56.449 --> 13:00.698
it was a matter of survival.
lt was a question of life and death.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.574
l was trying to avoid a gas chamber,

13:03.752 --> 13:07.372
not trying to sneak
into some school district.

13:08.008 --> 13:11.343
What you're suggesting
is insignificant in comparison,

13:11.513 --> 13:15.595
and don't you ever say otherwise.

13:15.811 --> 13:17.270
l'm sorry.

13:18.566 --> 13:24.607
You may think it's insignificant,
but it's my life.

13:39.264 --> 13:41.471
Three, two, one.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.811
lt has been one week to
the very second since l first met you.

13:46.024 --> 13:50.023
Well, what did you get me
for our anniversary?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.240
This.

13:56.540 --> 13:59.625
That girl gets on my nerves.
She's got no class.

13:59.795 --> 14:02.168
Steve can do better than that.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.748
So why don't you go tell him?

14:05.052 --> 14:06.083
Very funny.

14:08.224 --> 14:10.051
You'll get your surprise Saturday.

14:10.227 --> 14:13.680
- Oh, no, not this Saturday.
- What, you had plans?

14:13.857 --> 14:16.563
Well, it's a date l made
a few weeks back.

14:16.779 --> 14:17.810
Oh, well.

14:17.989 --> 14:21.074
l guess l'll have to find someone else
to go to the Fox Theatre with me.

14:21.244 --> 14:24.412
R.E.M.? Oh, my God!
You got R.E.M. tickets?

14:24.582 --> 14:26.242
House seats.

14:26.710 --> 14:30.756
l just changed my plans.
l can't believe you. Oh, my God.

14:30.925 --> 14:32.918
Happy anniversary.

14:34.055 --> 14:35.799
l'm out of here.

14:40.064 --> 14:42.770
So, my brother, are you down for this
Saturday, Dune Buggies ''R'' Us?

14:42.943 --> 14:44.485
- lt's gonna be rocking.
- Outstanding.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.146
- lt's kind of dangerous, isn't it?
- No, only if you're weak.

14:47.325 --> 14:48.950
Steve-o, you coming with us
or what?

14:49.119 --> 14:51.326
l can't make it.
l'm going to see R.E.M. that night.

14:51.498 --> 14:55.164
With Christine?
Sounds a little continuous.

14:55.337 --> 14:56.997
Sounds kind of nauseating,
if you ask me.

14:57.173 --> 15:01.006
- Do you have some objections?
- Hey, it's not my place to criticise.

15:01.179 --> 15:02.887
Never stopped you before.

15:03.099 --> 15:05.223
Steve, l think we should talk
about this in private.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.143
Will you look at the time?
Don't we have--?

15:07.313 --> 15:09.353
No, no, no, stay right here.

15:09.525 --> 15:11.981
l want you to hear how
Kelly disses my new girlfriend

15:12.154 --> 15:13.779
and pretends it's for my own good.

15:13.990 --> 15:16.482
Come on, Kel. Tell me everything
that's wrong with Christine.

15:16.661 --> 15:20.874
Look, all l'm gonna say is
you get what you pay for.

15:23.087 --> 15:24.629
Where does she get off?

15:24.798 --> 15:28.631
lt's amazing how a little competition
stirs the pangs of jealousy in a woman.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.592
No, no, no, she's not jealous,
she's just a snob.

15:31.809 --> 15:34.135
She thinks anyone who can't afford
to shop on Rodeo Drive

15:34.312 --> 15:35.557
is a lower life form.

15:35.731 --> 15:38.733
lt's not like Christine
lives in the Valley or anything.

15:40.447 --> 15:44.493
No offence.
Look, l didn't mean it like that, Andrea.

15:46.205 --> 15:49.575
Andrea, l was just passing by
the vice principal's office

15:49.752 --> 15:52.754
and Mrs. Teasley
wanted to talk to you.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.675
''And since l have grave doubts

15:59.851 --> 16:03.055
as to whether Miss Zuckerman
actually lives with her grandmother,

16:03.231 --> 16:07.444
l cannot in good conscience
complete the profile as assigned.''

16:07.905 --> 16:10.527
Signed, Cliff Kramer.

16:11.827 --> 16:16.455
- Are you all right, Andrea?
- Yeah, l'm fine. Fine, thank you.

16:16.626 --> 16:20.708
So l have no choice
but to initiate a formal enquiry.

16:20.883 --> 16:24.503
An investigator will contact your
grandmother to make a house visit.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.758
Well, l know, in your case,
l don't need to worry,

16:27.935 --> 16:31.720
because you really do live
at that address in Beverly Hills

16:31.899 --> 16:34.984
with your grandmother, don't you?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.631
So, what did your grandmother say?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.292
She's letting me
move in this weekend.

16:51.471 --> 16:53.548
l knew she wouldn't
hang you out to dry.

16:53.724 --> 16:57.723
Well, she said she'd rather
l truly live with her than pretend to.

16:58.189 --> 16:59.683
But l don't know if l can do that.

16:59.858 --> 17:03.524
Look, you've come this far.
You gotta hang in there.

17:06.117 --> 17:07.742
Andrea, l feel like an idiot.

17:08.997 --> 17:11.239
Brandon, you had no idea
this was gonna happen.

17:11.416 --> 17:12.448
l brought it on myself.

17:12.627 --> 17:14.954
l just wish there was something
l could do.

17:15.131 --> 17:18.049
Well, you could
help me move on Saturday.

17:18.261 --> 17:19.291
You got it.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.963
Oh, wait, this Saturday?
l gotta go dune-buggying with Dylan.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.801
l can come home early though,
if you want.

17:23.978 --> 17:26.470
Maybe l should go with you.

17:26.983 --> 17:29.736
l might break my neck and l wouldn't
have to deal with this anymore.

17:29.987 --> 17:33.488
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Don't talk like that.

17:33.659 --> 17:35.783
lt's gonna be okay.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.894
Thanks.

18:03.121 --> 18:07.666
Sanders.
Why don't you have to wait in line?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.829
Clean living, Dave.

18:14.513 --> 18:16.672
You know, these sheets
are 20 percent polyester.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.677
You don't ever have to iron them.

18:18.853 --> 18:20.478
Thank you.

18:21.982 --> 18:26.480
- You have a robe?
- No, l don't wear a robe, Grandma.

18:26.656 --> 18:29.658
l think a robe is nice, don't you?

18:31.497 --> 18:34.784
- Brian didn't wanna come over?
- No, Brandon, Grandma.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.461
He got delayed at Zuma Beach,
so l just took the bus.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.801
- And your parents didn't drive you?
- No.

18:50.192 --> 18:55.319
Grandma, l'm sorry
about the other night. l don't...

18:56.284 --> 18:58.776
l don't want you to think
that l was trying to make light

18:58.955 --> 19:03.037
of anything that
you went through in the war.

19:03.503 --> 19:05.496
l certainly hope not.

19:06.341 --> 19:09.129
l hope l didn't bring up
any bad memories for you.

19:09.805 --> 19:13.306
Look, l put the top on the bottom.

19:18.943 --> 19:24.188
Hello? Yes, yes, she's here.

19:24.577 --> 19:26.451
lt's for you.

19:28.333 --> 19:33.211
Hello? Mom, of course, l'm all right.

19:33.424 --> 19:36.260
l'm not getting involved. Mom.
That is between you and Grandma.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.095
Ma, l'm gonna hang up now, Ma.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.056
Ma, goodbye.

19:46.527 --> 19:50.776
- Was that great or what?
- R.E.M. was awesome.

19:51.075 --> 19:52.819
- Except--
- Except what?

19:52.995 --> 19:56.032
Well, l don't know, l thought maybe
you'd want to go backstage afterwards.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.287
l couldn't get passes.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.619
But couldn't you just tell them
who you are?

19:59.797 --> 20:01.541
The limo's gonna be here
any minute.

20:01.716 --> 20:04.884
Guys, could you believe that concert?
Wasn't it outrageous?

20:05.055 --> 20:07.843
- lt was supernaturally--
- Yeah, we get the gist, Dave.

20:08.018 --> 20:10.225
Oh, l'm sorry. You must be Christine.
l'm David Silver.

20:10.396 --> 20:13.849
l'm sure he's mentioned me.
Steve and l are close buds.

20:14.027 --> 20:15.854
Don't push your luck, bud.

20:16.030 --> 20:17.857
Are those autographs
on your programme?

20:18.033 --> 20:22.246
- Yeah, l just kind of snuck backstage.
- How did you get in?

20:22.414 --> 20:25.202
Clean living, Steve-o.

20:30.343 --> 20:34.009
- Where is that stupid driver anyway?
- Well, he probably went around back.

20:34.182 --> 20:36.306
Yeah, well, we're never using
this company again.

20:36.477 --> 20:38.684
And don't give him a tip.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.492
Here he is now.

21:00.180 --> 21:01.972
Hey, did you ever see the movie,
No Way Out?

21:02.183 --> 21:04.260
- No.
- Oh, it was great.

21:04.436 --> 21:06.844
Sean Young, Kevin Costner.

21:07.023 --> 21:11.402
They get it on in a limo.
A limo just like this one.

21:11.572 --> 21:14.859
Well, l'm sure they didn't have
a stupid driver like we've got.

21:15.036 --> 21:17.243
Come on, forget about him.

21:17.414 --> 21:19.241
The question is,
did you have fun tonight?

21:19.417 --> 21:22.335
Yeah, l did, until a few minutes ago.

21:25.134 --> 21:26.842
You know, l was thinking,
maybe next week,

21:27.012 --> 21:32.175
we could go to a jewellery store
and pick out a token of my affection.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.521
Oh, Steve.

21:38.655 --> 21:42.440
l think this whole limo thing
got to me because,

21:42.619 --> 21:46.404
well, it's just that
you make me feel like Cinderella.

21:46.583 --> 21:51.330
l mean, you're so generous.
l'm just afraid it's all gonna disappear.

21:51.507 --> 21:56.005
Well, it won't.
Believe me, you deserve it.

21:56.181 --> 22:00.050
Now all we have to decide is,
should it be jewellery for the hand,

22:01.648 --> 22:06.442
the ear or neck?

22:09.284 --> 22:14.162
- Steven, l love you.
- l love you too.

22:24.432 --> 22:25.926
Who would've thought it, huh?

22:26.101 --> 22:29.851
l move 1 0 miles closer to school
and l actually get a late slip.

22:30.024 --> 22:32.563
- So, you slept in for once.
- Who could sleep in

22:32.736 --> 22:35.773
with an insomniac grandmother
roaming around the place all night?

22:35.949 --> 22:39.615
Well, it's always those first few nights
in a new place that's the hardest.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.616
l mean, l do speak from experience.

22:41.792 --> 22:45.838
Yeah, he changes his address
like a model changes her clothes.

22:46.424 --> 22:49.094
- Hey, Steve.
- Yo, Steve.

22:49.261 --> 22:51.053
How was the limo, buddy?

22:51.223 --> 22:56.432
Oh, the limo was...cinematic.

22:57.065 --> 23:00.981
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, girls. Pull up a chair.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.653
So we'll pick you guys up,
what, 6:30, 7:00 at Brenda's?

23:04.868 --> 23:07.870
- Have we decided where we're going?
- l haven't spoken to Christine yet.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.748
Why don't we just decide later?

23:09.917 --> 23:13.786
ls this a double date?
How smooshy.

23:14.049 --> 23:15.294
Don't start, Kel.

23:15.468 --> 23:17.461
- l'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

23:17.637 --> 23:19.096
- Hey, take it easy, man.
- Bye, bro.

23:20.809 --> 23:23.515
Am l the only one who can see
what a phoney Christine is?

23:23.730 --> 23:25.522
Well, Steve seems to like her.

23:25.733 --> 23:27.975
He likes anything in a skirt
these days, Donna.

23:28.153 --> 23:29.351
He didn't used to be that way.

23:29.572 --> 23:32.194
The good old days.

23:32.702 --> 23:36.072
Hey, Andrea,
everything's gonna be okay, trust me.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.076
You just gotta look
on the bright side.

23:38.669 --> 23:41.587
What is the bright side, Brandon?

23:42.008 --> 23:45.758
l mean, l miss my family,
l have no privacy,

23:45.930 --> 23:49.051
and my grandmother
is a walking time bomb.

23:49.269 --> 23:50.929
What do you mean?

23:51.605 --> 23:55.141
l mean, there's no way to know what
she'll tell the investigator tomorrow.

23:55.361 --> 23:57.188
Andrea, let me ask you a question.

23:57.364 --> 23:59.903
ls this school
really worth all the hassle?

24:00.911 --> 24:04.115
You people have no idea
how good you have it, do you?

24:04.333 --> 24:06.575
You think every place is like this.

24:08.673 --> 24:11.960
Do you realise that the school
l'm supposed to go to

24:12.136 --> 24:15.672
doesn't have enough funds
to even put out a real paper?

24:15.976 --> 24:17.934
l guess l didn't think about it.

24:18.146 --> 24:21.979
Why should you?
Why should any of you?

24:22.611 --> 24:25.898
You buy new clothes every weekend.
You have CD players in your cars.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.860
You have no idea wha...

24:30.706 --> 24:32.913
l'm sorry. Forget it.

24:36.590 --> 24:38.215
Andrea, why are you so upset?

24:40.596 --> 24:44.809
l'm upset because the investigator
is gonna come tomorrow

24:44.978 --> 24:46.971
and it still looks like
l am an overnight guest.

24:49.610 --> 24:51.318
No way she's gonna believe
l live there,

24:51.529 --> 24:53.023
with all that grandma stuff around.

24:53.199 --> 24:55.323
Andrea, we can fix that.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.029
My middle name is makeover.

25:31.465 --> 25:34.135
Oh, you guys, l can't believe
how great this place looks.

25:34.302 --> 25:35.631
What do you think, Grandma Rose?

25:35.805 --> 25:38.379
- How do you like your new dormitory?
- l think it looks great.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.804
Finishing touch, a family photo.

25:42.022 --> 25:44.894
ls that your mom?
She's really pretty.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.068
lt's not a very good picture.

25:47.990 --> 25:50.363
Well, l think she looks beautiful.

25:53.581 --> 25:56.583
Grandma Rose, you're always making
fun of your cooking. This is great.

25:56.753 --> 25:58.034
- You like it?
- Yeah.

25:58.213 --> 26:00.586
lt's Evelyn's recipe.

26:00.759 --> 26:04.295
She can't play Kalooki to save her life,
but she cooks like the white tornado.

26:05.683 --> 26:08.175
l remember when you used to come
to our house on the holidays

26:08.354 --> 26:09.552
and cook for us.

26:10.732 --> 26:13.402
l wish you'd come over
more often, Grandma.

26:14.279 --> 26:16.735
l don't wanna talk about it, okay?

26:28.968 --> 26:32.634
You know,
l've never seen Steve so...

26:33.767 --> 26:36.437
- Happy.
- Yeah.

26:36.605 --> 26:38.016
l mean, ever since we've known him,

26:38.191 --> 26:41.561
he's either been hung up on Kelly
or chasing bimbos.

26:41.738 --> 26:44.906
And now l see how attentive he is
when he really cares about a girl.

26:45.076 --> 26:48.696
l mean,
he's so sweet and protective.

26:48.873 --> 26:53.003
Yeah, well,
just don't get any ideas, okay?

26:53.171 --> 26:55.045
Because you're taken.

26:56.969 --> 26:59.543
Oh, God, l'm starving.
How much longer?

26:59.723 --> 27:02.974
- Oh, l'd say 45 minutes?
- Forty-five minutes?

27:03.145 --> 27:06.811
Yeah, well, all right, look, look, look,
you ladies dangle somewhere,

27:06.984 --> 27:09.061
me and Steve-o,
we'll cook some hors d'oeuvres.

27:09.696 --> 27:10.859
- We will?
- Yeah.

27:11.032 --> 27:12.361
Yeah, we will.

27:13.619 --> 27:15.945
Good.
l always prefer to be waited on.

27:16.123 --> 27:17.404
l've noticed that about you.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.870
l thought we were going out tonight,
not doing all the drudgework ourselves.

27:21.089 --> 27:23.628
l mean, l could do that at home.

27:24.135 --> 27:26.259
You know, personally,
l prefer staying at home.

27:26.430 --> 27:28.423
l mean, it's so expensive to go out

27:28.642 --> 27:30.386
and normally
the food's not even that great.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.638
Unless you know where to go,
like Steve does.

27:32.815 --> 27:34.725
And then
you don't have to do the dishes.

27:34.943 --> 27:37.482
- Oh, baby, l'll do the dishes.
- Good.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.697
Hey, let's go look at your clothes.

27:42.705 --> 27:46.538
Oh, this belt is radical. This
must've set you back a few big ones.

27:46.711 --> 27:49.417
Actually, l stole it from my brother.

27:49.590 --> 27:52.212
Hey, you know, we should
go shopping together sometime.

27:52.386 --> 27:55.174
Oh, l'm having a slight recession
in my chequebook.

27:55.349 --> 27:56.927
Actually, l'm waiting for
the big sales.

27:57.101 --> 28:00.388
Oh, God, l hate the sales.
They're so crowded and smelly.

28:00.607 --> 28:02.185
Yeah,
but you can buy twice as much.

28:02.359 --> 28:04.186
Unless, of course,
you don't care about that,

28:04.362 --> 28:06.106
because, what,
you're independently wealthy?

28:07.033 --> 28:08.777
Well, l'm not.

28:09.704 --> 28:10.783
Do you like my dress?

28:11.373 --> 28:14.660
Actually, l was meaning to tell you
earlier, l think it's really fabulous.

28:14.878 --> 28:18.082
- Steve bought it for me.
- Oh, that was nice of him.

28:18.258 --> 28:20.465
And what is this l hear
about a jewellery store?

28:20.679 --> 28:23.597
Diamond earrings. l've been
dreaming about them constantly.

28:23.767 --> 28:24.798
Diamonds?

28:25.019 --> 28:27.345
Well, small ones.
l mean, not a whole carat or anything.

28:27.522 --> 28:29.515
But you know what would really make
my whole year?

28:29.734 --> 28:32.226
Spring break in Hawaii.

28:34.783 --> 28:36.860
Christine, you really haven't
known Steve that long.

28:37.037 --> 28:38.366
You know who Steve
reminds me of?

28:38.539 --> 28:40.865
Richard Gere in the movie
Pretty Woman.

28:42.170 --> 28:43.830
And you're Julia Roberts, right?

28:44.339 --> 28:47.127
- Why not?
- Because she was a prostitute.

28:48.679 --> 28:50.803
Yeah, but she looked great,
don't you think?

28:54.939 --> 28:56.932
Christine, Steve is my friend

28:57.109 --> 28:59.351
and l don't appreciate
the way that you're treating him.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.030
Well, l don't hear him complaining.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.067
- You're using him.
- We're using each other.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.651
Excuse me, ladies, crudites awaits.

29:05.872 --> 29:08.364
- l've lost my appetite.
- So have l.

29:08.584 --> 29:11.954
- Come on, Steve, let's go.
- Way to go, Bren.

29:12.173 --> 29:14.250
Steve, if you're smart,
you'll let that one just go.

29:14.427 --> 29:15.590
Some friend you are.

29:15.762 --> 29:19.049
The first girl to mean anything to me in
over a year, you go and blow her off.

29:19.226 --> 29:21.385
- l am your friend.
- Then you better get used to her,

29:21.562 --> 29:24.398
because l'm gonna see
a lot more of her, for a long time.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.061
l bet Kelly put you up to this.

29:26.278 --> 29:28.604
Steve, look,
l was just looking out for you.

29:28.782 --> 29:31.488
l mean, she admitted to me
that she was using you.

29:31.661 --> 29:34.948
Thanks, Brenda,
but l can take care of myself.

29:38.672 --> 29:43.466
Yeah, can l say hi to Mom?
Okay, l love you too.

29:45.474 --> 29:49.176
Hi, Mom. l'm fine, how are you?

29:49.354 --> 29:54.896
Yeah? Really? No.

29:57.617 --> 30:01.568
Ma, l'm sorry, l can't hear you.
What? Can you say that again?

30:01.748 --> 30:04.418
Oh, no, just the usual, you know.

30:05.086 --> 30:06.580
Ma, l'm-- Can you...?

30:06.756 --> 30:09.462
Ma, l'm gonna have to call you back
later. l can't hear anything.

30:09.635 --> 30:12.341
Okay, bye-bye.

30:12.765 --> 30:14.343
Grandma, can you please
stop vacuuming?

30:14.517 --> 30:19.097
Grandma, can you--? Grandma!
Please, stop vacuuming.

30:20.109 --> 30:24.405
Your girlfriends, they stirred up
all this dust, moving the furniture.

30:24.574 --> 30:28.989
Grandma, this is not about dust.
This is about you and my parents.

30:29.165 --> 30:31.123
l don't know
what you're talking about.

30:31.293 --> 30:33.666
Grandma, look,
l know that you hate my mother.

30:33.838 --> 30:36.875
But why are you taking it out on me?
You've never done that before.

30:37.051 --> 30:38.462
Andrea, l do not hate your mother.

30:38.679 --> 30:40.637
You haven't spoken to her
in three years.

30:40.807 --> 30:43.263
And why should l speak
to a person like that?

30:43.436 --> 30:45.844
She's not a horrible person,
even if she's not Jewish.

30:46.065 --> 30:50.111
This has nothing to do
with Jewish or not Jewish.

30:50.280 --> 30:54.196
Your mother has absolutely
no respect for me, none.

30:54.912 --> 30:55.991
How can you say that?

30:56.498 --> 31:00.414
When l broke my leg, did she ever
just once pick up a phone, maybe?

31:00.587 --> 31:02.379
Not once.

31:02.548 --> 31:07.046
Grandma, l can't defend my parents.
l don't know what really happened.

31:07.681 --> 31:11.347
- lt's water under the bridge.
- No, that's the trouble, it's not.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.522
l don't wanna be
in the middle of this anymore.

31:15.192 --> 31:17.102
Fine with me.

31:28.713 --> 31:31.715
What are you doing?
You redecorating again?

31:32.385 --> 31:34.711
No, l'm packing.

31:34.889 --> 31:37.511
l'm tired of living this charade.

31:37.685 --> 31:40.806
l'm just gonna bring my bag
to school

31:40.981 --> 31:43.307
and l'll come back later
for the rest of my things, okay?

31:43.485 --> 31:46.820
Andrea, your investigator
is coming today at 3:00.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.366
l know.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.658
So, what do you want me to tell her?

31:50.830 --> 31:52.954
Grandma, tell her the truth.

31:53.166 --> 31:55.290
Tell her l'm a liar,
tell her it didn't work out,

31:55.462 --> 31:57.336
tell her whatever you want.

31:58.591 --> 32:02.257
Then maybe everybody's conscience
can be clear

32:02.430 --> 32:04.969
and maybe l can have
my grandma back.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.940
Andrea. Andrea, come back.

32:26.342 --> 32:29.297
Hey, chief. How's it going?

32:31.600 --> 32:34.306
''l regret to inform you that
l will be resigning as editor,

32:34.479 --> 32:36.686
effective immediately''?

32:37.233 --> 32:39.475
- What happened?
- Nothing.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.313
l just thought
l'd make preparations now

32:41.489 --> 32:43.363
so l don't have to leave
in disgrace or chaos.

32:43.534 --> 32:45.527
Andrea, come on,
you are so fatalistic.

32:45.704 --> 32:48.030
But what about your grandma?

32:48.208 --> 32:50.367
l mean, you haven't even given it
a decent chance yet.

32:50.545 --> 32:54.960
Brandon, there are forces
working within my grandmother

32:55.135 --> 32:58.552
that began decades ago
on another continent.

32:59.350 --> 33:02.103
Might as well have been another
planet, as far as l'm concerned.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.306
What are you talking about?
Did she throw you out?

33:05.275 --> 33:08.396
No, threw myself out.

33:14.247 --> 33:16.454
Well, l don't know if it'll work,

33:16.626 --> 33:22.049
but do you want me to ask my parents
if you can come live with us?

33:22.218 --> 33:23.463
You'd do that for me?

33:27.100 --> 33:29.259
You're great.

33:30.230 --> 33:33.066
But that's not the answer either.

33:34.695 --> 33:36.403
Well, we could just try it out.

33:37.282 --> 33:40.237
Way too much responsibility
for your folks, Brandon.

33:40.412 --> 33:43.248
l mean, they would have to become
my guardians.

33:45.169 --> 33:49.500
No, l'm gonna just have to look at this
like a challenge.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.888
You know, the funny thing is,

33:54.057 --> 33:59.979
l was really starting to feel like
l was part of the gang, you know?

34:00.692 --> 34:01.723
l mean, your frien--

34:04.198 --> 34:06.654
Our friends.

34:08.161 --> 34:13.324
--they don't look at me like a geek who
lives on the wrong side of the tracks.

34:14.463 --> 34:17.583
And l know that there's more to them

34:17.760 --> 34:21.011
than their spiffy clothes
and their fancy cars.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.848
l guess that's something
that l never would have learned

34:27.024 --> 34:29.016
if l hadn't come here.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.228
And that's worth something, isn't it?

34:35.745 --> 34:39.364
- Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.
- What is it, partner?

34:39.543 --> 34:41.203
Can l talk to you outside
for a second?

34:43.924 --> 34:48.670
Brandon, l couldn't tell this
to just anyone, so...

34:48.849 --> 34:50.342
What is it?

34:51.268 --> 34:55.399
- Did Brenda tell you about last night?
- No, she didn't. l got home too late.

34:55.775 --> 34:58.232
Brenda and Christine
didn't exactly hit it off last night.

34:58.405 --> 35:00.363
So l let Brenda have it for that.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.573
Then afterwards,
l couldn't stop thinking about it

35:02.745 --> 35:05.319
and l started to see Christine
in a new light.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.243
What do you mean?

35:08.545 --> 35:12.758
lt's like she's obsessed with money.

35:13.219 --> 35:16.055
Well, that's not so unusual in L.A.

35:21.523 --> 35:23.183
You really fell for this one,
didn't you?

35:24.694 --> 35:28.740
Yeah. Yeah, l did.

35:29.952 --> 35:33.120
l guess l missed having a steady thing
more than l admitted.

35:33.291 --> 35:37.456
Let's face it, look at my track record.
lt's lousy, in the pick-up department.

35:38.507 --> 35:40.631
l want someone who likes me
for who l am,

35:40.802 --> 35:43.472
someone who'll be there
even if l have nothing in the bank.

35:44.224 --> 35:45.600
And you don't think she will?

35:47.020 --> 35:48.562
l'm gonna have to find out.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.608
- l already picked something out.
- l get to guess what it is, right?

35:51.777 --> 35:54.066
lf you want.
l hope you like it. l already paid for it.

35:54.239 --> 35:57.360
Well, why shouldn't l like it,
if you picked it out for me?

35:58.162 --> 36:01.366
- Go ahead, guess.
- Okay, l will. Okay.

36:01.542 --> 36:05.541
Well, it's not the engagement rings.
Not yet, anyway.

36:06.257 --> 36:11.217
And it's not the sapphire necklace,
although l wouldn't mind that either.

36:12.851 --> 36:15.093
l wouldn't mind the pearls,
but that's not it.

36:15.271 --> 36:17.560
The earrings, right there.

36:18.150 --> 36:19.431
No, that's not it.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.447
Well, don't keep me in suspense.
What is it?

36:26.204 --> 36:28.078
This is it.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.790
This is from me to you.

36:36.887 --> 36:39.011
- That's it?
- Don't you like it?

36:40.851 --> 36:42.809
Well, it's nice,
but it's not that special.

36:43.397 --> 36:44.856
Silly of me.

36:45.024 --> 36:48.644
l thought maybe, because it came
from me, it would be special to you.

36:48.863 --> 36:51.735
But that's okay. lf you don't want it,
maybe someone else will.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.369
Steve, wait. Please, don't get mad.

36:53.537 --> 36:56.409
l mean, let me see it again.
l didn't get a good enough look.

36:56.625 --> 36:58.452
Forget it.
Don't wanna give it to you anymore.

36:58.628 --> 36:59.909
But l was just being honest.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.966
l know, like the way you were honest
that first day in the Peach Pit,

37:03.135 --> 37:05.591
about not knowing
who my mom was, right?

37:07.558 --> 37:08.721
How did you know that?

37:09.979 --> 37:11.390
l didn't until right now.

37:15.988 --> 37:19.192
Goodbye, Christine. Have a nice life.

37:27.129 --> 37:29.882
Steve. What'll it be, pal?

37:30.051 --> 37:31.925
Whatever. Make it a double.

37:32.095 --> 37:34.468
So how did your little talk go
with Christine?

37:35.308 --> 37:36.684
Oh, that good, huh?

37:36.852 --> 37:38.929
Can you get off work
a couple hours early?

37:39.106 --> 37:43.022
l'm only in for a couple hours.
l gotta help Andrea move back home.

37:44.030 --> 37:47.815
- Yeah, splitsville.
- Bummer.

37:55.714 --> 37:58.586
So are you gonna buy,
or are you just window-shopping?

37:59.136 --> 38:00.844
You go ahead.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.230
That's a pretty sad song.

38:09.402 --> 38:13.864
Yeah, whenever l feel bad, l kind of
like to wallow in it for a little while.

38:14.034 --> 38:15.992
What's the matter, Steve?

38:17.748 --> 38:20.074
l broke up with Christine.

38:22.505 --> 38:25.377
Andrea, are you busy tonight?

38:26.260 --> 38:27.754
Yeah.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.296
Do you like me?

38:33.396 --> 38:35.436
Yeah, sure l do.

38:36.276 --> 38:39.397
Why? Why do you like me?

38:39.614 --> 38:45.453
Because underneath
that sometimes-rude exterior,

38:46.541 --> 38:50.457
lies a little boy
who likes to have fun.

38:52.842 --> 38:55.464
And you're kind of cute.

38:55.805 --> 39:00.516
l am rude, l know that.
l gotta work on that.

39:01.147 --> 39:02.772
Sometimes l lie awake at night

39:02.941 --> 39:05.148
remembering all the stupid cracks
l've said to people,

39:05.319 --> 39:08.072
wondering why
they even talk to me at all.

39:09.576 --> 39:11.902
Andrea, l'm sorry
if l hurt your feelings the other day.

39:13.791 --> 39:21.090
Well, try not to make so much fun
about the Valley, okay?

39:21.302 --> 39:25.218
You can't go back there.
We need you here, Andrea.

39:25.391 --> 39:29.176
- You're our inspiration.
- Right.

39:30.023 --> 39:31.352
Andrea, how many girls are there

39:31.526 --> 39:34.694
you can enjoy looking at
and also look up to?

39:35.198 --> 39:36.823
Thank you.

39:42.584 --> 39:46.714
So you think l'm cute, huh?
You never told me that before.

39:46.924 --> 39:48.584
You never asked.

39:49.177 --> 39:53.010
Well, in that case,
you think l'm sewy?

39:55.520 --> 39:57.430
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on over here?

39:57.607 --> 40:00.277
l've been trying to make this girl smile
for hours. No, days.

40:00.444 --> 40:02.104
You come in
and manage it in five minutes?

40:02.281 --> 40:04.155
You think you're the only one
that can be tight

40:04.325 --> 40:05.903
with the illustrious
Andrea Zuckerman?

40:06.078 --> 40:08.570
Yeah,
l have a lot of friends, Brandon.

40:08.749 --> 40:10.659
So don't leave them.

40:18.430 --> 40:19.711
Oh, she's here.

40:19.932 --> 40:23.598
Andrea. Hi, l'm Pat Roberts.

40:23.771 --> 40:26.227
l'm glad we could get to meet
in person.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.604
l feel l know you already, from reading
your editorials in the newspaper.

40:29.780 --> 40:32.865
- They're outstanding.
- Thank you.

40:33.035 --> 40:35.194
Goodbye, Mrs. Zuckerman.
l'll see you in three weeks.

40:35.372 --> 40:37.246
Bye-bye. lt was my pleasure.

40:37.417 --> 40:40.621
- What's in three weeks?
- A follow-up visit.

40:41.632 --> 40:44.669
- And your report will be...?
- Favourable.

40:46.598 --> 40:51.725
Listen, Andrea, be sure to stay
on this side of the hill, okay?

41:03.999 --> 41:05.659
Come on,
you're gonna ruin my makeup.

41:05.835 --> 41:07.116
You're not wearing any makeup.

41:07.295 --> 41:10.131
So maybe l'm gonna
wanna wear some later.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.213
Grandma,
what made you lie for me?

41:15.391 --> 41:17.468
You were right, Andrea.

41:17.644 --> 41:20.350
You shouldn't be in the middle.
You work so hard.

41:20.524 --> 41:24.855
And soon you'll be gone away
to college, married.

41:25.031 --> 41:27.570
- Can you stand it?
- What?

41:27.743 --> 41:28.906
Living with me for real?

41:29.454 --> 41:31.910
Believe me, darling,
l've been through worse.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.871
You know what?
l could use the company.

41:35.087 --> 41:39.169
Well, there is one thing
that we have to work out.

41:39.344 --> 41:42.465
- What?
- My parents.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.015
What are you doing?

41:46.229 --> 41:48.768
lf you want me
to live here with you, Grandma,

41:48.942 --> 41:52.478
we have to sit down and talk,
all together.

41:53.574 --> 41:55.068
Tonight.

41:56.370 --> 41:57.912
Mom?

41:58.748 --> 42:02.617
There's somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

42:11.601 --> 42:13.143
Hello, Beverly.

42:14.021 --> 42:15.219
Well, l'm fine.

42:15.398 --> 42:19.064
l got a little arthritis, a couple aches
and pains here and there,

42:19.237 --> 42:21.563
but otherwise, l'm okay. And you?

42:30.713 --> 42:33.668
And l baked this
with my own little hands.

42:33.843 --> 42:36.596
Yeah, right, Nat.
l work here, remember?

42:36.764 --> 42:37.962
Sit down, pal.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.801
''Good luck''?

42:39.977 --> 42:42.849
Well, when we made it, we didn't know
whether you were coming or going

42:43.023 --> 42:44.482
or staying or what, so...

42:44.693 --> 42:46.271
Well, l knew. l had no doubt about it.

42:46.445 --> 42:48.272
- Me either.
- lt's unanimous.

42:48.490 --> 42:50.364
You guys, thank you
for being there for me.

42:51.244 --> 42:54.032
- lt's great.
- What, you thought we wouldn't be?

42:55.334 --> 42:57.042
l don't know,
l figured that, you know,

42:57.212 --> 43:00.499
l would be gone
and you guys would just move on.

43:00.717 --> 43:02.627
Out of sight, out of mind.

43:02.803 --> 43:04.630
- Not!
- Not! No way.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.846
That would never happen
with someone as special as you.

43:08.061 --> 43:12.226
You know, Kelly, your interior
decorating made a world of difference.

43:12.401 --> 43:15.273
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:16.282 --> 43:18.571
Oh, stop it.

43:21.081 --> 43:24.582
Cake, cake, cake.
Who wants some cake?

43:30.178 --> 43:31.886
How you doing?

43:33.308 --> 43:36.512
l sure am sorry
l didn't listen to you, Kel.

43:36.688 --> 43:38.348
Me too.

43:40.318 --> 43:44.068
- l wanna give you something.
- What?

43:44.241 --> 43:45.866
Give me your hand.

43:52.962 --> 43:55.668
Thanks, but no, thanks.

43:55.884 --> 43:57.378
Go on, just take it.

43:57.594 --> 44:02.591
Steve, it's beautiful, but l don't want
something you bought for another girl.

44:06.274 --> 44:10.024
You look like you could use
some distraction. How about a movie?

44:12.033 --> 44:14.786
With you? Now?

44:14.996 --> 44:16.538
Dutch, of course.

44:16.707 --> 44:18.831
A romantic comedy,
to cheer you up.

44:19.044 --> 44:21.880
- Action-adventure?
- Mystery.

44:22.966 --> 44:24.591
You got it.

44:35.569 --> 44:38.322
Who would like a piece of cake?

44:38.490 --> 44:40.282
We-- Yeah, we'll just--

44:40.451 --> 44:44.700
No, l think not. l think each plate
should have a rose on it.

44:45.208 --> 44:49.290
- A yellow rose of Texas.
- The yellow rose of Texas.
