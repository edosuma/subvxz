And also--

08:44.730 --> 08:47.070
well, it's great,
and it uses some techniques

08:47.070 --> 08:49.669
of magic that are--
that really, really important.

08:49.669 --> 08:52.370
It uses repetition,
where it looks like

08:52.370 --> 08:55.200
kind of the same trick,
but it's done a different way.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.600

uh, there's
choreographed movement.

09:05.970 --> 09:09.070
You know, in--
in Western magic,

We're always trying
to be natural.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.200

that choreographed movement

09:17.200 --> 09:18.769
that looks just wonderful.

09:18.769 --> 09:20.669
And we loved the way the, uh--

09:20.669 --> 09:22.769
the costume was perfect.

09:22.769 --> 09:24.200
It looks perfect for the act,

properly--

09:37.970 --> 09:40.730

you can get across

09:42.870 --> 09:44.330

with this deck anyway.
[laughter]

13:16.370 --> 13:18.130
Yeah, it's just always,
I mean--okay.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.900
No, you keep shuffling.
We--we actually, uh--

13:19.900 --> 13:23.829
We need both decks, okay?
So, here, shuffle that again.

13:23.829 --> 13:26.270
Uh, two
thoroughly shuffled decks.

13:26.270 --> 13:29.069
Oh, and then, by the way,
those are, uh, real shuffles,

13:29.069 --> 13:31.470
okay?
So they're not strange magic

13:31.470 --> 13:34.230
kind of things.
Real, honest shuffles, okay?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.770
Are you happy
with your shuffle?

13:35.770 --> 13:37.770
- And I cut it, too.
- Oh, maybe you did

13:37.770 --> 13:39.069
all the work.
Maybe another round of applause

13:39.069 --> 13:41.130
for our shuffler, here, Connor?
Thank you for helping.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.900
That's really good.
[applause]

13:42.900 --> 13:45.429
And, um,
I noticed one day

13:45.429 --> 13:47.299
that decks of playing cards
actually behave a lot

13:47.299 --> 13:50.299
like musical instruments,
so they can be in tune

13:50.299 --> 13:52.569
or out of tune
with one another.

13:52.569 --> 13:55.169
And, um, you can actually
synchronize decks

13:55.169 --> 13:56.970
using sound waves.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.270
Now, it may sound strange.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.900
Have you ever
synchronized decks?

13:59.900 --> 14:02.500
Here's--here's how that goes.
First you look at the top card.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.669
For example, here we have
a king, okay?

14:04.669 --> 14:06.429
King of Spades,
can you see that?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.329
Okay?
Uh, could you hold on to that?

14:08.329 --> 14:10.230
Maybe just in your hand, there.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.829
And let's look
at the other card, here--

14:11.829 --> 14:13.029
is an ace, for example.

14:13.029 --> 14:14.730
So it's not the same card.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.770
But we are going to change that
right now.

14:17.770 --> 14:20.400
And we just use
the right frequency.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.600
So if you could hold that
in your left hand, there,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.870
and then slowly and softly
move it a bit.

14:24.870 --> 14:26.470
And we go with a sound;
it goes like

14:26.470 --> 14:27.669
♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪
Can you join in?

14:27.669 --> 14:29.970
We go...
Both: ♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪

14:29.970 --> 14:31.569
[laughter]
- Come on, please.

14:31.569 --> 14:33.270
That's science, okay?
[laughter]

14:33.270 --> 14:35.630
And, um--but you remember
those two cards

14:35.630 --> 14:37.299
that were not the same?
- Uh-huh.

14:37.299 --> 14:38.699
- Let's have a look
at them now.

14:38.699 --> 14:40.600
Can you turn the card over
and maybe--

14:40.600 --> 14:42.770
Ah, you see that?
They're synchronized.

14:42.770 --> 14:45.329
So we're getting somewhere.
[applause]

14:45.329 --> 14:48.529
That seems to work.
You place that there, okay?

14:48.529 --> 14:50.230
Wanna try that again?
Okay?

14:50.230 --> 14:51.870
Maybe you have a look at, uh--
at your next card.

14:51.870 --> 14:53.669
Just turn it over
and see what you have.

14:53.669 --> 14:55.169
Is it the same?
No.

14:55.169 --> 14:56.770
Look, I've got that one
you got, uh, and eight,

14:56.770 --> 14:59.069
for example, yeah?
[stammering]

14:59.069 --> 15:01.600
And, uh, now the idea
is to try that again.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.069
But by now you know the lines,
of course, okay?

15:04.069 --> 15:05.970
So, very slowly--
I won't even come close--

15:05.970 --> 15:08.130
you go like this:
♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪

15:08.130 --> 15:10.169
both: ♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪
[laughter]

15:10.169 --> 15:11.500
- Sounds good.
And have a look,

15:11.500 --> 15:13.669
and maybe it happened again.
And now we have

15:13.669 --> 15:16.100
exactly the same card again.
So, yeah.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.799
I mean, it's physics,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:18.799 --> 15:20.429
Now you place that there.
[cheering and applause]

15:20.429 --> 15:23.130
Okay?
Now, so far we've tried this

15:23.130 --> 15:26.000
with the top card,
but we can use any card.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.500
Well, you just have
to change pitch, okay?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.970
So, uh, Terry,
maybe could you name, say,

15:30.970 --> 15:33.600
a number between 5 and 10.
What would you like?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.069
- Six.
- Six, okay.

15:35.069 --> 15:37.829
Now six of course
is a bit lower in the deck,

15:37.829 --> 15:39.870
okay, so it's--it's not
♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪

15:39.870 --> 15:41.630
But six is actually
♪ Doo-do-loo-do-loo ♪

15:41.630 --> 15:42.799
Can we try, okay?
[laughter]

15:42.799 --> 15:44.500
We go...
both: ♪ Doo-do-loo-do-loo ♪

15:44.500 --> 15:45.829
- The key point--
the key point here

15:45.829 --> 15:47.429
is, uh, dignity, okay?
Very important.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.000
[laughter]
And, um, let's see

15:49.000 --> 15:50.970
if that worked.
I'll go first.

15:50.970 --> 15:55.329
That's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.470
Place that out
and the rest on top.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.270
And maybe, Connor,
can you do the same thing?

15:59.270 --> 16:02.169
Let's see, that's..
both: One, two, three,

16:02.169 --> 16:03.929
Four, five...

16:03.929 --> 16:05.569
- And the sixth card goes
to the side.

16:05.569 --> 16:07.029
You can place the rest on top.

16:07.029 --> 16:10.029
And, uh--now remember,
those were two genuinely,

16:10.029 --> 16:11.900
thoroughly shuffled decks,
right?

16:11.900 --> 16:13.329
Now, the card
at the sixth position

16:13.329 --> 16:16.900
in my deck happens to be
the four of diamonds.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.029
Now, Connor, could you show us
which card you shuffled

16:19.029 --> 16:21.069
to the sixth position
in your deck?

16:21.069 --> 16:22.870
And it is exactly
the same card.

16:22.870 --> 16:25.630
Can you see that?
Exactly the four of diamonds.

16:25.630 --> 16:28.370
So thank you very much.
Here we go.

16:28.370 --> 16:30.199
That's pretty cool.
[applause]

16:30.199 --> 16:31.500
Oh, but you know what?
That--

16:31.500 --> 16:32.870
That worked pretty well,
actually.

16:32.870 --> 16:34.829
We might as well try
and go all the way, okay?

16:34.829 --> 16:37.100
Should we try and synchronize
the whole decks?

16:37.100 --> 16:38.370
We can do that, maybe.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.370
Could you hold the deck
in your hand again?

16:40.370 --> 16:42.699
Oh, but for this,
I need all your help, okay?

16:42.699 --> 16:44.299
Maybe you can all join in.

16:44.299 --> 16:47.500
We use the collective resonance
of our audience here tonight.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.870
So, are you ready?

16:48.870 --> 16:50.270
Okay, here we go.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.169
all:
♪ Dee-de-lee-de-lee ♪

16:53.169 --> 16:54.500
Perfect.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.429
The Penn & Teller Singers,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:56.429 --> 16:57.799
That--that works really well.
[laughter]

16:57.799 --> 17:00.870
Now, I wonder what happened
to those decks?

17:00.870 --> 17:03.000
Um, Connor, could you turn over
the top card?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.599
Let's have a look.
And you have an ace.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.869
And look, I've got an ace.
That's pretty good.

17:05.869 --> 17:06.999
Just place it there.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.130
You have a look
at the next card,

17:08.130 --> 17:09.669
let's see what that is.
You've got a three,

17:09.669 --> 17:10.929
and I've got a three.
Very good.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.329
Maybe the next card.
That's looking good.

17:12.329 --> 17:13.499
You've got a seven,
I got a seven.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.900
So, I--I go first.
Look, I've got the queen.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.269
Yeah, show it, show it.
You have a queen.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.530
I've got the five,
and what do you--

17:17.530 --> 17:18.999
you've got the five.
Look, I got the two,

17:18.999 --> 17:21.169
and you got--show everybody
the bottom card,

17:21.169 --> 17:22.929
just to see
how far that actually reaches.

17:22.929 --> 17:24.900
Oh, well maybe we are not quite
on the bottom yet.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.099
We go
♪ Doo-do-loo-do-loo ♪

17:26.099 --> 17:28.269
And yes, now there we have
exactly the same card.

17:28.269 --> 17:31.300
And, uh, so we take this,
and I think we did it.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.370
Each and every card
completely synchronized

17:34.370 --> 17:36.870
throughout the whole deck,
up to the very last.

17:36.870 --> 17:39.969
Thank you very much.
That is synchronizing decks.

17:39.969 --> 17:41.130
There you go.
[cheering and applause]

17:41.130 --> 17:42.729
- Pit Hartling!
- Thank you very much.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.499
[cheering and applause]
Hi.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.870
Hello, Alyson.
- Wow.

17:47.870 --> 17:49.330
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.199
Do you think you fooled
Penn and Teller?

17:51.199 --> 17:55.130
- Well, you know,
Penn is also a musician,

17:55.130 --> 17:57.769
so he's very familiar
with all those frequencies

17:57.769 --> 17:59.669
and sound waves and stuff.

17:59.669 --> 18:01.330
He might actually understand
the physics of that

18:01.330 --> 18:02.800
better than I do.
I'm not sure.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.300
- You never know.
- Have you ever had

18:05.300 --> 18:07.669
what people might consider
a real job?

18:07.669 --> 18:08.999
- Ah.
[laughs]

18:08.999 --> 18:11.100
Well, uh, back in Frankfurt,
uh, at university,

18:11.100 --> 18:14.229
I studied psychology
and linguistics

18:14.229 --> 18:15.630
and philosophy.

18:15.630 --> 18:19.169
So, uh, no.
[laughter]

18:19.169 --> 18:21.400
Not really.
- [laughing]

18:21.400 --> 18:23.429
- So tell me about magic
in Germany.

18:23.429 --> 18:25.370
- Um, magic is actually
doing pretty well

18:25.370 --> 18:27.100
in Germany right now.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.199
We have between maybe 30 and 40

18:29.199 --> 18:31.630
small, uh, close-up theaters

18:31.630 --> 18:33.830
built specifically
to watch magic.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.169
So in that respect,

18:35.169 --> 18:37.669
it is almost little bit
like an G--Golden Age, I think.

18:37.669 --> 18:38.800
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.199
- All right, well,
let's check in...

18:40.199 --> 18:41.669
- See if they can
guess your magic.

18:41.669 --> 18:44.030
- Let's see what happens.
- Boys.

18:44.030 --> 18:46.999
- Boy, that's--boy,
that's a beautiful routine.

18:46.999 --> 18:48.600
- Oh, thank you.
- Uh, you don't usually

18:48.600 --> 18:50.199
see things that complex.

18:50.199 --> 18:52.969
You have--you have one thing,
then you add on to it,

18:52.969 --> 18:54.830
you add on to it,
and you add on to it.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.769
And there's just more
and more things just--

18:56.769 --> 18:58.830
just piling up,
one thing after the other.

18:58.830 --> 19:02.499
There's just a complexity.
And then, uh, one of the things

19:02.499 --> 19:06.169
that's wonderful about magic
is after you've, uh--

19:06.169 --> 19:07.900
just a little ways in,

19:07.900 --> 19:10.699
uh, you do these
really heavy provers,

19:10.699 --> 19:12.870
and then we start to trust you.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.100
And as you know...
- That's true.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.229
- That's a huge mistake
in magic.

19:16.229 --> 19:17.729
- That is true.
- [laughing]

19:17.729 --> 19:20.469
- As you would know, right?
- Yes, yes, as we would know.

19:20.469 --> 19:22.600
So we think we've given you
a few little, uh, hints

19:22.600 --> 19:24.070
to can take to the bank, there.
- A few--Yeah, that's true.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.729
I think I can accept
that happening.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.070
- Okay, good.
- Thank you.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.130
- Okay, the figured it out.
- Yes, I think they did.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.729
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you very much,

19:30.729 --> 19:32.530
it was nice to be here.
- Pit Hartling!

19:32.530 --> 19:33.600
- Thank you, bye-bye!
- Glad you came.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.669
We'll see you, man, again.

19:34.669 --> 19:37.300
[cheering and applause]

19:37.300 --> 19:39.269
- After the break,
Penn and Teller try

19:39.269 --> 19:40.929
to bust more magicians.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.269
They'll also perform a trick
of their own.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.600
Don't go anywhere.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.370
[cheering and applause]

19:46.370 --> 19:49.530
<i>[rousing brass music]</i>

19:52.329 --> 19:54.569
<i>[rousing brass music]</i>

19:54.569 --> 19:56.169
[applause]

19:56.169 --> 19:58.000
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

19:58.000 --> 20:01.169
Some magicians use methods
that are underhanded.

20:01.169 --> 20:03.300
This next magician
is from Australia,

20:03.300 --> 20:06.770
so she uses methods
that are down-underhanded.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.069
[laughter]
Take a look.

20:08.069 --> 20:10.099
[fireworks crackle]

20:10.099 --> 20:12.569
- In Australia, everybody
has a kangaroo

20:12.569 --> 20:13.970
in their backyard.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.500
<i>I've grown up with magic.</i>

20:15.500 --> 20:17.800
<i>My dad's a very well-respected
magician in Australia,</i>

20:17.800 --> 20:19.270
so I've grown up with it.

20:19.270 --> 20:22.470
And we've been working together
now for about 36 years.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.270
<i>I heard some
of my dad's friends</i>

20:24.270 --> 20:27.399
talking one night
about the water torture escape.

20:27.399 --> 20:30.700
And I of course piped up
and said, "Hang on a minute.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.369
<i>"I could anything as good
as what you could do."</i>

20:33.369 --> 20:35.230
And there was no turning back.

20:35.230 --> 20:37.599
I was the first woman
in the world

20:37.599 --> 20:41.300
to perform Houdini's
water torture escape.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.569
That was a good feather
in my cap.

20:44.730 --> 20:47.500
<i>I have two tricks
that are unique.</i>

20:47.500 --> 20:49.399
<i>No one else in the world
is doing them.</i>

20:49.399 --> 20:52.069
<i>This is Australia
versus Vegas,</i>

20:52.069 --> 20:53.300
and it's on.

20:53.300 --> 20:56.300
[applause]

20:58.470 --> 21:02.230
- Please say g'day
to Helen Coghlan!

21:02.230 --> 21:05.030
[cheering and applause]

21:05.030 --> 21:07.700
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.230
I'd like to show you a trick
which is the only one

21:10.230 --> 21:11.700
of its kind in the world.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.000
This, of course,
makes it unique.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.230
I'm using a glass,
also a plastic tube.

21:18.230 --> 21:21.430
On each end of the tube
are two caps,

21:21.430 --> 21:23.970
and you'll notice
that these caps have a hole

21:23.970 --> 21:25.599
right in the center.

21:25.599 --> 21:28.099
Now, the reason for these holes

21:28.099 --> 21:31.399
will become obvious
in just a moment.

21:31.399 --> 21:36.770
I'll take the glass
and fill it with milk.

21:36.770 --> 21:39.770
I'll fill it right up
to the top--

21:39.770 --> 21:42.669
to about there is fine--

21:42.669 --> 21:44.669
cover the glass.

21:44.669 --> 21:46.970
But I'd like to show you,
or mention to you,

21:46.970 --> 21:50.329
that the glass
completely fills the tube,

21:50.329 --> 21:54.129
and there is no gap
between the glass and the tube

21:54.129 --> 21:56.399
for any sneaky little business.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.700
Place the top cap on.

21:58.700 --> 22:02.230
Now, if I took
a solid copper rod

22:02.230 --> 22:05.730
and told you I could
push this rod all the way

22:05.730 --> 22:07.169
through the glass of milk,

22:07.169 --> 22:09.899
you might think
that was impossible.

22:09.899 --> 22:14.829
But we all know with magic
that sometimes, the impossible

22:14.829 --> 22:17.629
is actually possible.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.430
Take that right out
the other end.

22:20.430 --> 22:21.629
[audience amazement]

22:21.629 --> 22:25.129
Take the top cap off,
take off the tube,

22:25.129 --> 22:28.829
and all I can say
is, "Cheers."

22:28.829 --> 22:31.829
[cheering and applause]

22:36.770 --> 22:38.329
Thank you.

22:38.329 --> 22:42.270
Now, because I have come
all the way from Australia,

22:42.270 --> 22:44.730
I thought I'd give you
two tricks

22:44.730 --> 22:46.169
for the price of one.

22:46.169 --> 22:48.899
And the next trick
is also one of a kind.

22:48.899 --> 22:50.230
It's actually a trick

22:50.230 --> 22:53.470
using my grandfather's
old tennis racket.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.399
He doesn't use it anymore.

22:55.399 --> 22:57.030
He's dead.

22:57.030 --> 23:00.169
[laughter]

23:00.169 --> 23:02.730
Now, I hope you don't mind,

23:02.730 --> 23:04.700
but I'd like
to take the liberty,

23:04.700 --> 23:07.399
at this point,
to rewrite the rules.

23:07.399 --> 23:09.629
And let's agree that

23:09.629 --> 23:13.200
if even one of these two tricks
fools you,

23:13.200 --> 23:15.069
I still get
to take home the trophy.

23:15.069 --> 23:16.829
[laughter]
- I'll take that as a "yes."

23:16.829 --> 23:18.200
- Okay.
[laughter]

23:18.200 --> 23:20.430
Alyson, can you please
give me a hand with this trick?

23:20.430 --> 23:22.099
- Sure.
- Would you please like

23:22.099 --> 23:23.500
to make sure it's empty.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.770
Show everybody that there's
nothing in the cover.

23:24.770 --> 23:25.930
- Yep.

23:25.930 --> 23:30.069
- I'll show everybody
the racket.

23:30.069 --> 23:31.599
Happy with that?
- Yes.

23:31.599 --> 23:33.270
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.200
- Now, with this trick,

23:35.200 --> 23:37.200
there is just a word
of warning:

23:37.200 --> 23:40.970
Don't blink, or you'll miss it.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.430
[audience amazement]

23:42.430 --> 23:46.129
- Wow.
- Game, set, and match.

23:46.129 --> 23:48.300
Thank you.
[applause]

23:48.300 --> 23:51.430
- Wow, Helen Coghlan!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.629
That's incredible!
[applause]

23:53.629 --> 23:56.270
Ah, wow.
- Wow.

23:56.270 --> 23:58.399
It was so quick,
I'm glad I didn't blink.

23:58.399 --> 24:00.329
- I'm glad it worked.
- Yes.

24:00.329 --> 24:01.599
[laughter]

24:01.599 --> 24:05.069
So you've been doing magic
for--for how long?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.899
- Oh, pretty much
for all my life.

24:06.899 --> 24:09.030
My dad's a magician, um--
Arthur Coghlan;

24:09.030 --> 24:11.629
he's a very well-respected
magician in Australia--

24:11.629 --> 24:14.399
so I've grown up with magic.
- And did you come up

24:14.399 --> 24:16.569
with this trick, or did you
and your father..?

24:16.569 --> 24:18.930
- Dad came up with that trick,

24:18.930 --> 24:20.930
so that's why
it's one of a kind.

24:20.930 --> 24:22.470
- So did your dad
come with you tonight?

24:22.470 --> 24:25.069
- He did.
Mum and Dad and my daughter

24:25.069 --> 24:26.599
have made the trip
from Australia.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.200
- Yay.
[applause]

24:28.200 --> 24:29.399
Where are they?
- Over there.

24:29.399 --> 24:31.899
- Hi!
[applause]

24:31.899 --> 24:35.369
So, do you think you'll fool
Penn and Teller?

24:35.369 --> 24:37.730
- Yes.
- Yes.

24:37.730 --> 24:40.169
I like your confidence.
How come?

24:40.169 --> 24:41.430
- Well, for this--
to start with,

24:41.430 --> 24:43.470
this is the only one
of its kind in the world,

24:43.470 --> 24:45.000
so they wouldn't
have seen that.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.270
And hopefully they won't
have figured out...

24:48.270 --> 24:50.030
- Right.
- How to do it.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.800
- [laughs]
All right, I think it's time

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
to check in with the dudes.
- Okay.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.599
- Guys.
- All the way from Australia,

24:57.599 --> 25:00.169
uh, hailing with your--
your little tricks.

25:00.169 --> 25:02.430
- Yep.
- And you gave us two tricks.

25:02.430 --> 25:05.099
Then you came out
and you kind of framed

25:05.099 --> 25:08.099
the tennis racket thing,
kind of an elastic way

25:08.099 --> 25:09.970
that kind of said
we had a---

25:09.970 --> 25:11.500
do both of them.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.000
And, uh, I think
I've given you a--

25:13.000 --> 25:15.369
maybe a little bit of an idea
of how one of them, um...

25:15.369 --> 25:16.399
- Yep.
- Might be done.

25:16.399 --> 25:19.069
One of them, uh,
did not fool us.

25:19.069 --> 25:22.470
The other one we're--
we're kind of puzzling about.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.599
Um...uh, yeah,

25:24.599 --> 25:27.700
there's two tricks, uh--

25:27.700 --> 25:29.800
Well, the one trick we got.
We got the one trick.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.129
- Okay.
- No problem on that.

25:32.129 --> 25:33.800
[laughter]
- Okay.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.599
- Would you like a sketch
on how the one trick is done?

25:36.599 --> 25:38.099
'Cause we have that one.

25:38.099 --> 25:41.500
We could--we could
get that built, right, today.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.599
[laughter]

25:43.599 --> 25:46.629
We got one, there's no--
and we'd like to tell you,

25:46.629 --> 25:49.300
we'd like to change the rules
right now and say,

25:49.300 --> 25:52.270
"If we figured out one of them,
I think we figured out--"

25:52.270 --> 25:53.470
[laughter]
- But...

25:53.470 --> 25:56.629
- No deal!
- We thought--we thought maybe

25:56.629 --> 25:59.569
uh, that the--the milk thing

25:59.569 --> 26:02.629
had a little gasket
in the bottom,

26:02.629 --> 26:05.869
but then the wand came out dry.

26:05.869 --> 26:09.569
And that bugged us.
[laughter]

26:09.569 --> 26:11.770
And then we thought you had

26:11.770 --> 26:15.930
a little channel
in the center of it...

26:15.930 --> 26:19.800
but we saw the overhead shot...

26:19.800 --> 26:22.470
and it was milk
all the way across.

26:22.470 --> 26:24.869
And that bugged us.
[laughter]

26:24.869 --> 26:26.770
So let's get back
to the tennis racket.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.800
[laughter]

26:28.800 --> 26:30.129
- No, no, no.

26:30.129 --> 26:31.530
Let's stick with the milk.
Let's stick with this.

26:31.530 --> 26:33.730
- We got you nailed
on the tennis racket thing.

26:33.730 --> 26:36.930
So we think
we would like to give you...

26:36.930 --> 26:38.369
half a trophy.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.399
[laughter]

26:40.399 --> 26:43.270
But since this is television...
- It's a fooler!

26:43.270 --> 26:47.099
- And you came all the way
from Australia

26:47.099 --> 26:49.770
We were gonna give--
but the tennis racket!

26:49.770 --> 26:52.099
Can we tell you,
brothers and sisters

26:52.099 --> 26:53.169
of "Fool Us"...
- Oh, no.

26:53.169 --> 26:54.200
- The tennis racket
did not fool us!

26:54.200 --> 26:56.369
- Whoo!
Awesome!

26:56.369 --> 26:57.470
- That fooled us.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.599
Nicely done.
- Aww.

26:59.599 --> 27:02.129
Helen Coghlan ladies and gentlemen.

27:02.129 --> 27:03.430
[cheering and applause]

27:03.430 --> 27:05.369
- Tennis racket
didn't fool us!

27:05.369 --> 27:07.470
[cheering and applause]

27:07.470 --> 27:09.669
- Penn and Teller are fooled!

27:09.669 --> 27:11.300
And we're just
getting warmed up.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.069
They're taking on
more magicians

27:13.069 --> 27:15.129
when "Fool Us" returns.

27:15.129 --> 27:17.399
[cheering and applause]

27:17.399 --> 27:20.069
<i>[rousing brass music]</i>

27:22.900 --> 27:25.269
<i>[rousing brass music]</i>

27:25.269 --> 27:27.769
[cheering and applause]

27:27.769 --> 27:29.529
- Welcome back to "Fool Us"!

27:29.529 --> 27:32.769
When we scoured the Earth
for the world's best magicians,

27:32.769 --> 27:35.100
we found our next performer
in Israel.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.200
Take a look.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.200
[fireworks crackle]

27:38.200 --> 27:40.269
- Basically, as a mentalist
you can read minds,

27:40.269 --> 27:42.569
<i>you can bend spoons,
you can move objects.</i>

27:42.569 --> 27:44.630
<i>I don't claim to have
supernatural powers,</i>

27:44.630 --> 27:46.370
<i>but I have superhuman powers.</i>

27:46.370 --> 27:47.830
<i>[spooky music]</i>

27:47.830 --> 27:51.100
Besides being a performer,
I'm also an inventor in magic.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.330
<i>Some of my ideas, they take
over a decade to come out</i>

27:54.330 --> 27:56.600
<i>because I'm my own,
eh, biggest critic,</i>

27:56.600 --> 27:59.229
<i>and I if I don't like it a 110%,</i>

27:59.229 --> 28:01.330
<i>it's not coming out
for the world.</i>

28:01.330 --> 28:03.830
I'm using real objects,
sharp objects.

28:03.830 --> 28:06.200
One time I performed something
called "the spike effect",

28:06.200 --> 28:08.529
where I was trying to find
a hidden knife

28:08.529 --> 28:10.130
with my eyes blindfolded.

28:10.130 --> 28:14.269
Because I let my guard down,
the knife went through my palm.

28:14.269 --> 28:16.670
<i>Penn and Teller know so much
about magic,</i>

28:16.670 --> 28:17.900
<i>but because what I do</i>

28:17.900 --> 28:19.529
<i>is something
that nobody else does,</i>

28:19.529 --> 28:20.799
<i>I might actually fool them.</i>

28:20.799 --> 28:23.799
[applause]

28:25.569 --> 28:27.670
- Please welcome
the powerful mind

28:27.670 --> 28:30.930
of Menny Lindenfeld!
[applause]

28:30.930 --> 28:32.529
- Thank you.
Thank you.

28:32.529 --> 28:34.269
Alyson, hi.

28:34.269 --> 28:35.799
Would you please come here
and take a seat?

28:35.799 --> 28:36.969
Right here.
- Sure.

28:36.969 --> 28:38.630
- The amazing Alyson,
everybody.

28:38.630 --> 28:40.499
[applause]

28:40.499 --> 28:42.900
Alyson, in a moment--

28:42.900 --> 28:45.400
In a moment,
I will attempt

28:45.400 --> 28:47.870
to manipulate matter
without touch.

28:47.870 --> 28:51.100
- In fact, I'm going
to teach you how to do this.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.729
- Thanks.
- You know, it's like

28:52.729 --> 28:54.330
bending a spoon, basically.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.900
But instead, I'm going to use
these, uh, metal objects

28:56.900 --> 28:58.430
that I have collected
from the audience

28:58.430 --> 28:59.799
before the show.
- Wow.

28:59.799 --> 29:01.769
- So, for example,
here we have a--

29:01.769 --> 29:03.299
a glass filled with coins.

29:03.299 --> 29:06.100
And, please,
examine these coins.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.700
And while you do,
I want to also show

29:08.700 --> 29:10.900
that I have here
a few eyeglasses

29:10.900 --> 29:12.299
that I have, uh, collected,

29:12.299 --> 29:14.830
and I would like to thank those
who lended me their glasses,

29:14.830 --> 29:17.029
and also apologize

29:17.029 --> 29:19.069
that they won't be able
to see my show.

29:19.069 --> 29:20.670
[laughter]

29:20.670 --> 29:23.330
And, Alyson, one more thing.
I also have this.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.569
- Oh.
- Yeah!

29:27.569 --> 29:29.799
- Now, that is a saw...
- Somebody likes saws.

29:29.799 --> 29:31.630
And I did not collect this
from the audience.

29:31.630 --> 29:33.469
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Right.

29:33.469 --> 29:35.299
And the reason
I have chosen the saw

29:35.299 --> 29:38.430
is because the blade
is made of hardened steel,

29:38.430 --> 29:40.569
and no matter what you do,

29:40.569 --> 29:42.029
this cannot be bent,
basically.

29:42.029 --> 29:43.029
- Right.
- All right?

29:43.029 --> 29:44.569
But we come back to this
in a moment.

29:44.569 --> 29:47.529
Would you please,
uh, take any coin out?

29:47.529 --> 29:50.729
Just one coin, and hand me
the rest of them.

29:50.729 --> 29:55.729
And I want you
to sign your coin.

29:55.729 --> 29:57.069
Perfect.

29:57.069 --> 30:00.999
And you can blow on the coin
to make sure the ink is dry.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.029
- [blowing]
[laughter]

30:03.029 --> 30:04.469
- Very nice.
- [laughs]

30:04.469 --> 30:05.670
- And I'll take the coin.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.200
I just want to show it
to the camera again.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.930
This is Alyson's coin
with Alyson's signature.

30:09.930 --> 30:11.370
Now, Alyson, I promised
that you are going

30:11.370 --> 30:12.600
to do this tonight, right?

30:12.600 --> 30:13.729
So here's what I want
you to do:

30:13.729 --> 30:15.330
I want you to take
your right hand,

30:15.330 --> 30:16.670
and open it like this.

30:16.670 --> 30:20.430
Take the coin, put it
in your right fist, like so,

30:20.430 --> 30:22.469
hold your hand straight out,
like this,

30:22.469 --> 30:26.799
and concentrate on the coin
the entire time.

30:26.799 --> 30:28.930
Now I'm going to show you
exactly what to do, okay?

30:28.930 --> 30:30.900
I'm going to use
the other coins,

30:30.900 --> 30:32.330
and I'm going to stand
right here.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.170
And here's
what I'm going to do.

30:34.170 --> 30:35.900
I want you to think,
in your mind,

30:35.900 --> 30:38.729
that this coin
is becoming softer,

30:38.729 --> 30:40.799
and softer, and softer.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.029
Its just becomes softer.

30:42.029 --> 30:43.499
It's all in your mind.

30:43.499 --> 30:46.170
And slowly start
massaging the coin.

30:46.170 --> 30:47.229
- Mm.
- Can you feel it bending now,

30:47.229 --> 30:48.799
in your hand?
- Maybe?

30:48.799 --> 30:51.130
- Yes, it's starting
a little bit, right?

30:51.130 --> 30:52.830
Yeah.
Turn your hand around

30:52.830 --> 30:54.900
and open your hand.
I want you...

30:54.900 --> 30:57.799
- [gasps]
- To put your coin right here.

30:57.799 --> 30:59.569
Now, I wanna show this...
[audience amazement]

30:59.569 --> 31:00.799
To the audience.

31:00.799 --> 31:02.569
This is your signature
right there, yes?

31:02.569 --> 31:05.400
- Yes.
- The coin is bent,

31:05.400 --> 31:08.100
and it has bent
in your closed fist.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.729
I didn't do it, she did.
[applause]

31:09.729 --> 31:11.499
Wait, wait, wait,
please, no, no.

31:11.499 --> 31:14.999
I want to show you first
that--

31:14.999 --> 31:16.600
what happens
to the other coins.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.729
You see, this coin is bent,
this coin is bent,

31:19.729 --> 31:21.299
this coin is bent,
this coin is bent.

31:21.299 --> 31:23.900
In fact,
every single coin there

31:23.900 --> 31:25.269
is now bent.

31:25.269 --> 31:26.969
The amazing Alyson,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.769
- That's amazing.
[applause]

31:29.769 --> 31:32.229
That's totally...
- And Alyson,

31:32.229 --> 31:34.400
I'm going to try some more.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.229
Can you look at me, please?
- Yeah.

31:36.229 --> 31:39.430
- I'm gonna put this
on your face like this.

31:39.430 --> 31:40.830
Oh, can you look
at the camera?

31:40.830 --> 31:42.299
- Whoa.
- Doesn't she look good, right?

31:42.299 --> 31:43.600
- Oof.
- Yes. [chuckles]

31:43.600 --> 31:44.830
- Oof.
- It's a little hard.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.069
It makes you dizzy,
a little bit, right?

31:46.069 --> 31:48.130
- Somebody is definitely not
seeing this show.

31:48.130 --> 31:50.370
- Can you look at me?
- Yeah.

31:50.370 --> 31:53.229
- Okay, Alyson, here's what
I'm going to ask you to do:

31:53.229 --> 31:56.799
In--I want you to put
both your hands like this.

31:56.799 --> 31:59.130
And I want you to focus
your e--

31:59.130 --> 32:01.299
on this spot right there.
- Right there.

32:01.299 --> 32:02.499
- Yeah, exactly.
- Okay.

32:02.499 --> 32:03.999
- Be very serious about it,
okay?

32:03.999 --> 32:06.130
- Yeah, I am.
- Now, here's what we are going

32:06.130 --> 32:07.830
to try to do.
Okay, are you ready?

32:07.830 --> 32:09.600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.299

32:36.769 --> 32:37.870

32:37.870 --> 32:40.729
- Alyson, um,
let's do some--

32:40.729 --> 32:41.870
something more.
Here, take this.

32:41.870 --> 32:44.469
Put this on.
This is for protection, okay?

32:44.469 --> 32:48.370
And I want you to put
this on as well, right there.

32:48.370 --> 32:49.499
Perfect.
And if you don't mind,

32:49.499 --> 32:52.430
can you stand right here
next to me?

32:52.430 --> 32:56.930
I'm going to ask you,
which one do you prefer?

32:56.930 --> 32:57.999
Take this.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.569
Take it out,

32:59.569 --> 33:01.469

hold it--

33:01.469 --> 33:03.200
okay, I'm gonna hold it.
It's very dangerous.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.400
- I've totally used
a saw before.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.200
- Now, hold this like so.
- Okay.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.069
And this is going to be
the indication saw.

33:09.069 --> 33:10.670
You know what that means?
- No.

33:10.670 --> 33:12.269
- It means that in a moment,

33:12.269 --> 33:15.430
we are going to compare
these two saw.

33:15.430 --> 33:19.700
Just like this, all right?
And I want you to concentrate

33:19.700 --> 33:21.670
on the saw with me, okay?
- Okay.

33:21.670 --> 33:23.670
- [deep breath]
- On my saw?

33:23.670 --> 33:24.670
Your saw.
- My saw.

34:17.770 --> 34:20.629

you could start bending metal?

34:20.629 --> 34:22.699
- Well, I come
from Israel, right?

34:22.699 --> 34:26.000
And in Israel,
everybody looks up to one guy--

34:26.000 --> 34:27.429
his name is Uri Geller.

34:27.429 --> 34:29.730
He was, eh, in the '70s
very famous,

34:29.730 --> 34:31.969
and he made spoon-bending
very famous.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.168
- Yes.
- And since I was a kid,

34:34.168 --> 34:37.069
when my friends would,
uh, stand outside in the field,

34:37.069 --> 34:38.168
play soccer, right?

34:38.168 --> 34:39.668
I would stand
in front of flowers,

34:39.668 --> 34:40.899
try to move them
with my mind.

34:40.899 --> 34:42.069
- Oh.
- And at one point,

34:42.069 --> 34:43.730
it actually did move...
- Nice.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.069
- And I was super excited
about it.

34:46.069 --> 34:48.370
Today I look back
and I know it's just the wind

34:48.370 --> 34:49.429
that did it, but, uh...
- Yeah.

34:49.429 --> 34:50.799
[laughter]
Yeah.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.000
Have there been any props

34:53.000 --> 34:55.500
that you just couldn't bend?

34:55.500 --> 34:58.370
- Well, not--not yet, anyway.
- Oh, good.

34:58.370 --> 34:59.569
- The biggest thing
I've ever bent

34:59.569 --> 35:02.029
was a jet engine,
the blade of the jet engine.

35:02.029 --> 35:03.270
- Wow.
- Which of--

35:03.270 --> 35:05.930
Which was the hardest thing
to ever do,

35:05.930 --> 35:07.500
but it was okay, yeah.
- So, did I really

35:07.500 --> 35:08.770
do that trick?
- Yeah.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.000
It's in your hand,
it's your signature,

35:10.000 --> 35:11.569
and--and take this coin,
it's for you.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.330
- Yes, I do want to.
Are you gonna give the--?

35:13.330 --> 35:14.569
- Although, you--
you owe a quarter

35:14.569 --> 35:15.830
for somebody in the audience.
- Oh, okay.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.230

35:17.230 --> 35:19.069
Okay, I think they're ready.
- Yeah, they are?

Okay.
- Let's go check with them.

35:20.569 --> 35:23.000
Boys.
- Ah, Menny.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.730
Boy, there's a lot
going on here.

35:24.730 --> 35:26.330
You do one of
our favorite things in magic,

35:26.330 --> 35:29.299
which is, uh, doing apparently
the same trick

35:29.299 --> 35:31.169
with different methods
all the time,

35:31.169 --> 35:32.469
all the way through.
- Right.

35:32.469 --> 35:34.330
But there's--the most
important thing you use

35:34.330 --> 35:35.870
is a wonderful technique
of magic,

35:35.870 --> 35:37.669
which is
the displacement of time.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.200
Just things happening
in a different time

35:40.200 --> 35:41.399
than we might think
they were happening.

35:41.399 --> 35:43.469
- Right.
- And I also love the fact

35:43.469 --> 35:45.669
that for one of the tricks--
and I won't say which one

35:45.669 --> 35:47.969
unless you push me--
but, um, you were doing

35:47.969 --> 35:52.629
a great deal of effort
to do the exact opposite

35:52.629 --> 35:54.500
of what it looked like
you were doing.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.770
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

35:55.770 --> 35:56.870
- Are you with them?
- Yeah.

35:56.870 --> 35:59.399
You're too smart, man.

35:59.399 --> 36:01.200

- Thank you, thank you so much.

- Now, you didn't fool them,
but you entertained us.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.770

Thank you so much.

Alyson.

36:46.299 --> 36:48.029
We're gonna show you
a little trick now.

36:48.029 --> 36:49.500
We're gonna show you
this trick, Alyson,

36:49.500 --> 36:52.199
and then we're gonna teach
you and the whole audience

36:52.199 --> 36:53.600
how it--how it's done, okay?

36:53.600 --> 36:54.929
This is one, uh, with,

36:54.929 --> 36:57.199
uh, you buy three or four
containers of mints,

36:57.199 --> 36:59.270
so these little mini-containers
you see there.

36:59.270 --> 37:00.569
You just take two of them

37:00.569 --> 37:03.199
and just, uh, dump 'em out.

37:03.199 --> 37:06.000
So you've got, uh,
two empty containers

37:06.000 --> 37:08.529
of mints, and one
full container of mints.

37:08.529 --> 37:11.029
And this takes the form
of a gambling game.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.569
You know that the mints
are in that one

37:12.569 --> 37:14.400
and these two are empty, right?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.699
So, Alyson, very carefully,

37:15.699 --> 37:17.330
just watch Teller's
fancy moves--

37:17.330 --> 37:18.699
we'll teach you this later--

37:18.699 --> 37:21.369
and just see if you can follow
where the mints are, okay?

37:21.369 --> 37:22.929
You knew where they were
to start.

37:22.929 --> 37:24.469
Now keep your eye on him,
watch him--

37:24.469 --> 37:25.869
he's holding two
at a time, there.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.600
Now, Alyson, which one
of these three containers

37:28.600 --> 37:30.170
now contains the mints?

37:30.170 --> 37:32.900
- Uh, the middle one?
- The middle one?

37:32.900 --> 37:34.529
Well, Alyson, you were wrong,
because it's...

37:34.529 --> 37:37.029
[rattling]
it's actually over there, okay?

37:37.029 --> 37:38.770
We'll watch again.
He's gonna mix it up.

37:38.770 --> 37:40.929
You know where they are now.
Keep your eye on him.

37:40.929 --> 37:46.130
Try to make it
a little easier this time.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.299
Now, Alyson,
where are the mints?

37:48.299 --> 37:50.600
- Definitely the middle one.
- Definitely the middle one?

37:50.600 --> 37:52.130
Well, Alyson, you didn't--
[rattling]

37:52.130 --> 37:53.330
You didn't get that right.
- [groans]

37:53.330 --> 37:54.730
We'll make things
a little easier for you.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.569
We'll take, uh, one of the ones
and put 'em aside

37:56.569 --> 37:57.830
so we only have two left.

37:57.830 --> 37:59.400
We'll take one of
the empty ones, put it there.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.469
And now we'll just,
uh, mix 'em up again.

38:01.469 --> 38:02.900
Now, you know where it is.
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.069
- Watch carefully, now.

38:07.199 --> 38:09.000
There.
Where is it now, Alyson?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.100
- Right one.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.670
- No, Alyson...
- [groans]

38:11.670 --> 38:13.900
- It's actually not
the right one.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.130
Now, we promised you, Alyson,
that we would show you

38:16.130 --> 38:18.469
how this was done, okay?
So why don't you take

38:18.469 --> 38:20.299
one of the empty ones
and hold that

38:20.299 --> 38:22.569
right in your hand, okay?
And Teller will take

38:22.569 --> 38:25.170
the full one and put it
in his hand, okay?

38:25.170 --> 38:28.029
Now watch this, Alyson.
If you were to guess right,

38:28.029 --> 38:30.699
we would just do this,
and move them from...

38:30.699 --> 38:32.600
[rattling]
His...

38:32.600 --> 38:34.770
[rattling]
To yours.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.299
- What?
- It was all done

38:36.299 --> 38:38.069
with real magic.
Open that up, you'll see

38:38.069 --> 38:41.000
that that's where
the mints are, right there.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.270
[audience amazement]
- Oh, my goodness.

38:43.270 --> 38:45.170
- Now obviously, Alyson,
we don't do it

38:45.170 --> 38:46.929
with real magic.

38:46.929 --> 38:48.299
We do it with--
it's the fact that

38:48.299 --> 38:51.029
you can't really tell
the directionality of sound.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.429
So Teller can just take
any one of the empty ones

38:54.429 --> 38:57.369
and make it look
like it has...

38:57.369 --> 38:59.029
[rattling]
Mints in it.

38:59.029 --> 39:01.199
Remember at the beginning
I said carefully buy three

39:01.199 --> 39:04.230
or four of the tins?
We actually buy four,

39:04.230 --> 39:06.770
and one of the tins
is right up his sleeve...

39:06.770 --> 39:07.969
- Oh.
- Like that.

39:07.969 --> 39:09.969
Whenever he shakes his hand...
[rattling]

39:09.969 --> 39:12.699
He can make it seem
like he's got that, there.

39:12.699 --> 39:14.529
Now, mints are not
quite loud enough,

39:14.529 --> 39:17.500
so what you might want to do
is take the container

39:17.500 --> 39:20.170
and fill it with, you know,
some metal nuts, there.

39:20.170 --> 39:21.569
- Oh.
- Gives it a little more sound.

39:21.569 --> 39:24.369
And also, Teller loves nuts.
[laughter]

39:24.369 --> 39:25.670
And then when he does it,

39:25.670 --> 39:26.900
he can do it
with the whole body.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.699
[rattling]
[laughter]

39:28.699 --> 39:30.469
- There's a trick
you can do at home.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.500
- Wow.
- Just get yourself

39:31.500 --> 39:34.130
four mints containers
and a few nuts.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.170
- [amazed exclamation]

39:35.170 --> 39:38.100
[cheering and applause]

39:38.100 --> 39:40.500
Whoo!
That's all for tonight,

39:40.500 --> 39:41.900
If you want more of "Fool Us,"

39:41.900 --> 39:44.270
we'll be here waiting for you
when you come back.

39:44.270 --> 39:47.529
'Till then,
goodnight from Las Vegas!

39:47.529 --> 39:49.000
[cheering and applause]

39:49.000 --> 39:54.500
