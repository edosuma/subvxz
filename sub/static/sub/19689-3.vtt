00:00.220 --> 00:01.908
<i>Previously on</i> Underground...

00:01.933 --> 00:03.034
Rosalee's got her head in a vice

00:03.066 --> 00:04.501
and you want to talk about
your sad feelings?

00:04.535 --> 00:06.004
Maybe she running 'cause of
what you done to her, Momma?

00:06.037 --> 00:07.739
You ever think about that?

00:07.772 --> 00:10.942
I got word on where
this Harriet Tubman may be.

00:10.974 --> 00:12.577
Why shouldn't I be writing
the book about her?

00:12.609 --> 00:15.613
Focus on what you got to do now.

00:15.647 --> 00:18.917
They call her the Black Rose.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.419
And that girl seemed to know Harriet.

00:24.288 --> 00:25.824
Retrieve my Black Rose.

00:30.295 --> 00:32.964
"I could work as much
and eat as much as a man...

00:32.997 --> 00:37.369
"when I could get it...
and bear the lash as well.

00:37.402 --> 00:40.106
"And ain't I a woman?

00:40.972 --> 00:43.575
"I have borne 13 children,

00:43.607 --> 00:48.212
"and seen most all sold off to slavery,

00:48.245 --> 00:52.049
"and when I cried out
with my mother's grief,

00:52.083 --> 00:54.619
"none but Jesus heard me.

00:54.652 --> 00:56.320
And ain't I a woman?"

00:56.354 --> 00:58.990
Black folks up there talking like that?

00:59.022 --> 01:00.891
- That's what this says.
- To whole crowds of white folks?

01:02.125 --> 01:03.861
What else does it say she say?

01:05.662 --> 01:07.465
You know, part of it's missing.

01:07.498 --> 01:09.467
- Some of it's smudged.
- Well, read what you can.

01:10.192 --> 01:13.305
"He says women can't have
as much rights as men,

01:13.337 --> 01:15.640
"'cause Christ wasn't a woman.

01:15.673 --> 01:17.641
"Where did your Christ come from?

01:17.674 --> 01:19.477
"From God and a woman.

01:19.510 --> 01:22.347
Man had nothing to do with Him..."

01:22.943 --> 01:24.315
What does she mean by that?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.433
Daddy.

01:32.456 --> 01:35.274
It means you strong,
not just in your body,

01:35.792 --> 01:37.905
but in your mind, too.

02:20.772 --> 02:22.340
Hey!

02:22.373 --> 02:24.343
Where the hell you been?
You supposed to be working!

02:25.610 --> 02:27.064
You hear me?

02:27.918 --> 02:29.552
Where the hell you been?

02:31.281 --> 02:34.084
- Answer me!
- Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

02:34.118 --> 02:36.488
- S-she been sick, all morning.
- Ain't no excuse.

02:36.521 --> 02:38.356
You right, you right,
you right! T-This my fault.

02:38.388 --> 02:40.058
I-I told her she could get some rest.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.860
Now, I only said that 'cause
you got me going to play music

02:41.892 --> 02:42.996
for Massa Matthew later, and I thought

02:43.030 --> 02:44.407
she could do some singing.

02:45.701 --> 02:47.699
Y'all get your asses back to work!

02:47.731 --> 02:48.866
Yes, sir.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.536
What in the hell wrong with you?

02:52.570 --> 02:53.772
Been covering your ass
all morning and you walk

02:53.804 --> 02:54.873
around the quarters like a...

02:54.905 --> 02:56.440
Ain't nobody ask you to save me.

03:06.951 --> 03:08.587
You mad about that girl?

03:10.154 --> 03:11.383
She ain't mean nothing.

03:15.827 --> 03:18.316
You best be ready to sing
for Massa Matthew later.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.035
Yeah, she washed up here.

03:24.067 --> 03:27.272
<i>Lost a lot of blood while doing it.</i>

03:27.304 --> 03:29.406
Some of the more industrious
runaways have been known

03:29.440 --> 03:32.444
<i>to stuff turkey feathers in
their clothes to stop buckshot.</i>

03:32.476 --> 03:34.912
Didn't quite work against
my long-range rifle though, huh?

03:34.946 --> 03:36.815
Your aim must have been off.

03:36.848 --> 03:39.617
<i>Looks like this Black Rose
is still alive.</i>

03:39.649 --> 03:40.718
<i>Patty don't miss.</i>

03:40.750 --> 03:43.053
Well, it is widely believed

03:43.087 --> 03:45.656
in some scientific circles

03:45.690 --> 03:48.226
<i>that the negro woman has
an almost supernatural ability</i>

03:48.259 --> 03:49.676
<i>to bear pain.</i>

03:49.893 --> 03:52.097
Perhaps that came into play.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.898
She's only good to us alive,
Mr. Donahue.

03:54.932 --> 03:56.333
<i>Now we've broke her into some pieces.</i>

03:56.367 --> 03:59.189
<i>And some of those pieces
are on the ground here.</i>

03:59.221 --> 04:01.005
<i>And some of them are over that way.</i>

04:01.037 --> 04:03.975
My "aim" is follow those
pieces all the way back

04:04.007 --> 04:05.409
to Harriet Tubman.

04:05.442 --> 04:06.743
All right!

04:06.777 --> 04:08.313
Let's move out!

05:13.511 --> 05:14.879
Aah!

06:33.758 --> 06:37.195
Mary. It's time for your piano lesson.

06:43.634 --> 06:45.336
Get up on that bed.

06:45.808 --> 06:46.976
I can't.

06:48.564 --> 06:49.899
Come on, now.

06:54.845 --> 06:56.181
Come on, jump!

06:58.049 --> 06:59.784
Higher, higher, higher.

07:12.496 --> 07:14.265
<i>This life be hard</i>

07:14.297 --> 07:16.134
<i>and unfair.</i>

07:16.647 --> 07:19.904
You gonna know pain, and ain't
much I can do about that.

07:21.806 --> 07:24.008
But every once in a while,

07:24.040 --> 07:26.643
we can steal moments like this one.

07:27.103 --> 07:29.869
If you can hold onto them,

07:30.957 --> 07:33.053
it'll help you through the hard times.

07:34.181 --> 07:35.853
Understand?

07:37.588 --> 07:39.013
Good.

07:41.258 --> 07:44.190
Now make this bed up
better than you ever have,

07:44.694 --> 07:46.663
or I'm gonna sic Patty Cannon on you.

08:23.431 --> 08:24.734
- Who shares this shame?
- Speak, girl!

08:24.767 --> 08:25.902
Who was the father?

08:25.935 --> 08:27.070
The ancestors took your child

08:27.102 --> 08:28.470
for your sin, for his sin.

08:28.503 --> 08:29.805
Tell us, who lay with the unwed?

08:29.838 --> 08:31.140
Speak! Speak now!

08:31.173 --> 08:32.976
- Who is the father?
- One belong to another?

08:33.009 --> 08:34.143
- Speak, girl!
- Who was the father?

08:34.174 --> 08:35.409
Who shares this shame?

08:35.443 --> 08:36.597
Look here!

08:44.044 --> 08:45.921
How long that buckra been watching?

08:45.954 --> 08:47.422
Is that Massa Roe?

08:47.456 --> 08:49.759
- Too young.
- Could be his son.

08:49.792 --> 08:52.262
What he doing so far
from the great house?

08:53.916 --> 08:55.597
Daughter.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.600
Me know this tradition feel harsh.

08:58.496 --> 09:02.838
But you're being shamed
because you should feel shame.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.775
What you done disgraced all of we.

09:07.309 --> 09:10.476
But we gonna help you carry your burden.

09:11.908 --> 09:14.116
Speak so that you can be free.

09:18.821 --> 09:21.691
We ain't gonna give up on you.

09:22.331 --> 09:24.075
You tell we.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.779
And we will heal
this here wound together.

09:27.812 --> 09:29.231
- That's right. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

09:29.265 --> 09:30.933
Who shares this shame?

09:30.967 --> 09:32.702
Speak, girl. Who the father?

09:32.735 --> 09:35.605
Ancestors took your child
for your sin, for his sin.

09:35.637 --> 09:37.773
Tell we. Who lay with the unwed?

09:37.807 --> 09:39.909
- Speak! Speak, girl!
- Who the father?

09:53.521 --> 09:55.057
Solomon.

09:55.644 --> 09:57.179
That's what we name him.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.895
<i>What you think, huh?</i>

09:59.928 --> 10:01.830
- You a Solomon?
- Solomon.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.978
No. It don't feel right.

10:07.114 --> 10:08.438
How about Sam?

10:08.471 --> 10:11.073
Ah, come on now.

10:11.106 --> 10:12.808
Solomon's a good name.

10:12.842 --> 10:14.276
It's a strong name.

10:14.309 --> 10:18.747
He was the wisest man that ever lived.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.097
I think he was King David's
first born son...

10:26.306 --> 10:29.291
I's sorry. All right? Sorry.

10:30.203 --> 10:32.561
You can tell me about it.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.299
Look here.

10:38.501 --> 10:41.871
I ain't gonna let them
take this one from you.

10:41.904 --> 10:43.740
Okay?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.210
It be a girl...

10:48.644 --> 10:50.080
I like Rosalee.

11:50.564 --> 11:53.041
Want to know what this here tree mean?

11:54.148 --> 11:55.511
What it's purpose.

11:55.791 --> 11:59.557
Don't know why you'd want
to trap spirits after they die.

12:00.589 --> 12:03.753
Seems to me they finally free.

12:10.759 --> 12:13.895
You let 'em fester, them evil
spirits will eat away

12:13.928 --> 12:16.466
at everything good
and whole in this life.

12:17.799 --> 12:19.896
They follow you into the next.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.528
Ain't no freedom in that.

12:23.672 --> 12:24.941
I don't believe in your spirits.

12:24.973 --> 12:26.392
Hmm.

12:26.976 --> 12:28.440
That a shame.

12:29.645 --> 12:31.449
'Cause they seem to believe in you.

12:34.116 --> 12:36.452
And them poisons you're taking,
they ain't gonna get rid of 'em.

12:36.485 --> 12:37.754
And what will?

12:39.521 --> 12:41.376
Your rituals?

12:42.191 --> 12:44.144
Maybe the Bible.

12:44.927 --> 12:46.395
No.

12:47.496 --> 12:50.600
Ain't none of us been from
Africa for a long time.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.869
Your spirits don't matter here.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.613
They certainly didn't protect
your daughter.

12:59.808 --> 13:02.410
And that white man's Bible is just that,

13:02.443 --> 13:04.046
for white men.

13:05.793 --> 13:08.217
This pain you're feeling ain't new.

13:09.552 --> 13:12.418
It thrives on isolation.

13:14.337 --> 13:16.626
We ancestors teach we that.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.729
That we ain't in this alone.

13:52.688 --> 13:55.025
Will you do this for me, Momma?

15:02.891 --> 15:04.587
Well, there's less blood,

15:04.619 --> 15:07.362
but it's looking like she crossed here.

15:07.396 --> 15:09.465
Well, then go on in after her.

15:13.335 --> 15:15.037
That water is cold as hell.

15:15.070 --> 15:16.693
I ain't getting in there.

15:16.733 --> 15:18.302
Saw a crested bank

15:18.336 --> 15:20.605
a half-mile that way where we can cross.

15:21.366 --> 15:23.374
No, that's where we're gonna cross.

15:23.408 --> 15:25.243
You, however, are going to cross here

15:25.275 --> 15:26.777
so that we don't lose her trail.

15:27.416 --> 15:28.546
What about Smoke?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.581
- What about Smoke?
- He should go.

15:30.615 --> 15:32.650
- No, he should not.
- And why the hell not?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.218
Because I am going to bed Smoke later,

15:34.251 --> 15:35.654
and I don't want to catch a cold.

15:35.687 --> 15:37.720
Patty, listen...

15:38.923 --> 15:40.325
Take off your clothes,

15:40.357 --> 15:43.328
and get in the damn water, Jack.

15:47.450 --> 15:48.809
Oh...

15:49.266 --> 15:50.968
$10 pants...

15:57.475 --> 15:59.611
All right.

16:02.012 --> 16:03.347
Oh, God!

16:03.381 --> 16:05.516
Ah! Whoo!

16:44.722 --> 16:46.491
Mm.

16:46.524 --> 16:48.994
Massa Matthew don't know what he in for.

16:49.026 --> 16:50.429
Once he hears that voice of yours...

17:00.337 --> 17:02.545
Maybe lay off it a bit, yeah?

17:03.074 --> 17:05.188
Seeing as how we're going
to the big house.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.913
More reason not to.

17:17.922 --> 17:20.325
Why you look like...

17:20.357 --> 17:21.693
you're going to a funeral?

17:21.724 --> 17:23.828
Who you trying to fool?

17:23.859 --> 17:25.194
Massa's house, that's home.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.432
That's where you're at your best.

17:30.635 --> 17:33.171
I was at my best when I was his whore?

17:33.203 --> 17:35.607
Be better if that's all it was,

17:35.639 --> 17:38.876
but what you and massa had, that was...

17:38.910 --> 17:39.945
that was more.

17:39.978 --> 17:41.336
No, it wasn't.

17:41.878 --> 17:43.414
Then what about Rosalee?

17:43.447 --> 17:44.582
Security.

17:44.616 --> 17:45.750
Little James?

17:45.782 --> 17:47.452
An accident.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.553
And I made sure I wouldn't
have any more of those.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.122
But you was his

17:52.769 --> 17:54.725
way more than you were my momma.

17:55.419 --> 17:57.127
19 years he owned you.

17:57.161 --> 17:58.630
I said when.

17:58.663 --> 18:00.632
I said where. Always.

18:00.664 --> 18:01.799
You controlled nothing.

18:01.833 --> 18:03.768
You protected nothing.

18:04.219 --> 18:05.203
All you did was...

18:06.503 --> 18:08.305
...fatten me up for the slaughter.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.640
I did the best that I could.

18:09.674 --> 18:11.308
Fed me all their lies.

18:11.643 --> 18:13.377
Told me if I stayed in line...

18:13.411 --> 18:16.147
"Yes, sir. No, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, massa"...

18:16.180 --> 18:17.716
that I'd be safe.

18:18.050 --> 18:21.701
I was massa's most exceptional nigger,

18:22.465 --> 18:23.788
just like you taught me.

18:23.820 --> 18:27.391
And all it did was give me
the length of a rope.

18:27.424 --> 18:31.296
And-and... and you went right on
back to being one of his whores.

18:31.992 --> 18:35.500
His fingerprints all over you.

18:37.018 --> 18:40.070
And you ain't never sang for nobody

18:40.779 --> 18:43.174
the way you sang for him.

21:46.324 --> 21:48.025
That one there.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.328
The more you do this,
it'll harden your muscles.

21:51.362 --> 21:53.598
<i>Keep you strong for the task at hand.</i>

21:55.021 --> 21:58.036
I's ain't never seen a woman
know about this kind of work.

21:58.068 --> 22:01.138
My daddy was a lumber inspector.

22:01.172 --> 22:04.444
He worked most of his life under
God's roof for Massa Stewart.

22:05.142 --> 22:06.978
How he settling in to his new life?

22:08.412 --> 22:10.548
He don't know what to do with himself.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.163
He say them Canada trees feel different.

22:14.324 --> 22:16.087
Suppose he right.

22:18.364 --> 22:20.131
He'll get used to it.

22:21.955 --> 22:23.962
What if I can't make
my momma run with me?

22:25.020 --> 22:27.130
She pretty settled in her ways.

22:27.164 --> 22:28.646
So was mine.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.735
She was meant to wait out her bondage.

22:30.768 --> 22:33.738
She was always telling us
how we was term slaves.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.505
We be free at 45.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.854
When I was younger,

22:38.209 --> 22:39.544
I thought that made us special.

22:39.577 --> 22:41.011
The promise of freedom

22:41.045 --> 22:42.714
if you just work harder.

22:42.747 --> 22:44.315
That's how they get you.

22:44.347 --> 22:46.183
My brother believed in that.

22:46.216 --> 22:47.417
And when the lie was exposed,

22:48.366 --> 22:49.754
and she learnt she was meant to be

22:49.787 --> 22:51.772
a slave forever,

22:53.391 --> 22:56.594
by that time, well, it was too late

22:56.626 --> 22:58.766
for her to take the journey by foot.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.099
But I, I put her on a
carriage up north anyway,

23:02.133 --> 23:05.703
and I tell you, that woman,
she grumbled the whole way.

23:09.205 --> 23:13.005
"Hard and unfair,"
is how my momma used to call it.

23:14.645 --> 23:18.782
For her, it was about
making the best life

23:18.816 --> 23:20.617
inside the pain.

23:21.589 --> 23:23.722
She'd do anything
to protect her chillun.

23:25.755 --> 23:27.624
Looking at you, swinging that axe,

23:27.657 --> 23:28.959
she doing something right.

23:35.598 --> 23:37.568
This whole island really
going to be yours someday?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.736
- Unfortunately.
- Hot damn. To the South!

23:39.770 --> 23:41.372
And its follies.

23:41.405 --> 23:42.741
To the South!

23:44.808 --> 23:46.711
This is not meant to be a party.

23:46.743 --> 23:48.145
So you got kicked out of the academy.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.446
Who cares?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.714
Look around.

23:50.748 --> 23:52.049
You don't have to go to war

23:52.083 --> 23:53.318
for a legacy like the rest of us.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.953
I'm not staying.

23:54.985 --> 23:56.420
I'm just here until I figure
out what to do next.

23:56.453 --> 23:57.789
It would be more accurate

23:57.821 --> 23:59.489
to say you're hiding
out from your father.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.327
I suppose if you're
gonna be a terrible host,

24:02.359 --> 24:03.760
I'll be forced to drink
with your niggers.

24:03.793 --> 24:04.795
They ain't mine.

24:08.866 --> 24:10.200
Thank you, sir.

24:11.335 --> 24:13.239
That a boy.

24:14.605 --> 24:16.274
Be forced to drink for your sorry excuse

24:16.307 --> 24:18.175
as a master as well.

24:18.209 --> 24:19.943
This is exactly what I was
talking about right here,

24:19.976 --> 24:21.411
what this island does to you.

24:21.444 --> 24:22.946
What? Makes you drink with the help?

24:22.980 --> 24:24.208
No, it changes you.

24:24.241 --> 24:25.983
My stepmother,
she was a farmer's daughter

24:26.017 --> 24:28.119
on a little piece of
land near Charleston.

24:28.152 --> 24:30.822
Sweet as apple pie.
When she first moved here,

24:30.855 --> 24:33.857
I remember she was uncomfortable
being waited on hand and foot.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.828
Then her hand was okay
with it, then her foot.

24:37.406 --> 24:39.329
By the time I left,
she spent most of her time

24:39.363 --> 24:42.533
hollering at the house girls,
calling them incompetent,

24:42.566 --> 24:43.835
beating them with a switch.

24:43.867 --> 24:45.535
What are you going on about?

24:45.568 --> 24:48.039
In New York, I remember
hearing it called "bondage,"

24:48.071 --> 24:50.960
and the word, well,
it always stuck with me.

24:50.994 --> 24:54.347
Slavery is such a
one-sided term for it all.

24:54.380 --> 24:58.031
Bondage suggests a duality,
that it affects us, too.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.167
Brings out the worst.

25:00.201 --> 25:04.355
It's akin to, I don't know, root rot.

25:04.387 --> 25:06.289
Well, that's it for me.

25:06.322 --> 25:08.756
None of you are worth a salt,
except this one here.

25:09.696 --> 25:10.949
What's your name?

25:12.263 --> 25:13.730
Hicks, sir.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.492
Hicks.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.837
You'll drink with me, right?

25:32.916 --> 25:35.351
Uh... why-why don't we
hear some singing?

25:36.353 --> 25:38.957
Yes, maybe that'll bring
Matthew out of his foul mood.

27:53.027 --> 27:55.396
Hold it. Be still.

27:55.428 --> 27:56.531
Still now.

27:59.133 --> 28:01.169
Just... just a bit.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.517
Don't move, don't move.

28:06.888 --> 28:08.408
All done.

28:11.444 --> 28:13.681
Send his body back to his family.

28:13.714 --> 28:14.848
He ain't got any.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.185
Well, then dig a grave.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.385
Yeah.

28:19.686 --> 28:21.622
Let's get this equipment
up and move out.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.524
Based on the state of
our poor friend, Jack,

28:23.558 --> 28:25.004
she couldn't have crawled far.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.095
Mr. Donahue, hold up.

28:27.127 --> 28:28.362
How about this for a caption?

28:28.396 --> 28:30.264
"One of three Patty Cannon gang members

28:30.298 --> 28:32.767
"murdered in cold blood
by the notorious slave stealer,

28:32.800 --> 28:34.335
the Black Rose."

28:34.367 --> 28:37.371
I think your caption murders
veracity in cold blood.

28:44.961 --> 28:46.446
Well, you can't make a legend

28:46.480 --> 28:48.316
out of the truth.

28:49.118 --> 28:52.409
At least, not one worth publishing.

28:53.154 --> 28:54.856
Elaborate.

28:55.545 --> 28:58.392
What was the most interesting
story you heard about me?

28:58.425 --> 28:59.860
Before you decided to write the book.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.233
The baby over the fire?

29:07.474 --> 29:08.970
All right.

29:09.002 --> 29:12.874
Recite it back to me, as you heard it.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.675
As I heard it,

29:14.708 --> 29:18.212
you and your men were on the
trail of a runaway named Banjo,

29:18.245 --> 29:20.982
who killed his master
and hightailed it north.

29:21.014 --> 29:23.016
Sounds like a fairly ordinary day.

29:23.050 --> 29:25.587
You came upon a small shack in Braintree

29:25.619 --> 29:27.754
occupied by a young, black couple

29:28.026 --> 29:29.723
with a three-year-old boy.

29:30.346 --> 29:33.727
You suspected that this couple
had recently harbored Mr. Banjo,

29:33.761 --> 29:36.164
so you held the head of their baby

29:36.196 --> 29:40.795
over the fire until the young
couple gave up the man's plan.

29:45.845 --> 29:47.449
And do you think that story is true?

29:49.276 --> 29:50.855
And does it matter if it isn't?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.315
'Cause it's a good one.

29:52.713 --> 29:55.116
Whether folks are
telling it or hearing it,

29:55.148 --> 29:58.100
they feel the fire,
they hear the screams,

29:58.653 --> 30:01.055
and they think of their own babies.

30:01.427 --> 30:02.889
It's sensational.

30:02.923 --> 30:04.592
And that's what
this story's going to be.

30:06.009 --> 30:07.762
We build up the Black Rose

30:07.794 --> 30:12.266
so that when you catch her
and she leads you to Moses,

30:12.300 --> 30:15.322
your place in history
is assured, is that it?

30:15.354 --> 30:18.238
And you, my friend,

30:18.271 --> 30:19.906
get a best seller.

30:20.301 --> 30:21.871
Yes?

30:21.905 --> 30:24.878
You're not worried you'll
build up the legend,

30:24.912 --> 30:26.079
and then fail to catch her?

30:26.112 --> 30:28.282
I like a good story, too, Mr. Donahue,

30:28.316 --> 30:30.985
but it's really money
that gets my attention.

30:32.686 --> 30:35.023
Do you know the average price
on a runaway's head?

30:35.368 --> 30:36.402
Five hundred?

30:36.722 --> 30:39.032
A few months back,
there were seven runaways

30:39.065 --> 30:41.562
worth a thousand each.

30:41.595 --> 30:44.966
A few of my men lost their lives
trying to collect that reward.

30:45.492 --> 30:46.934
Something tells me

30:46.966 --> 30:51.316
that this Black Rose is connected.

30:52.373 --> 30:55.009
"Negro girl named Rosalee.

30:55.041 --> 30:57.845
"Mulatto, delicate nature, well made.

30:57.877 --> 31:00.447
Wearing fancy dress upon escape."

31:01.410 --> 31:02.784
Hmm.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.151
You lucky massa ain't
sic the overseer on you.

31:05.184 --> 31:06.988
All you had to do
was look pretty and sing.

31:07.021 --> 31:08.589
It's your fault.

31:08.621 --> 31:10.824
- You know I didn't want to go up there.
- You ain't tell me nothing.

31:10.858 --> 31:12.126
You know how I got
these stripes on my back.

31:12.158 --> 31:13.427
Yeah, you mess up at the great house

31:13.461 --> 31:14.529
and then you get sent out in the field.

31:14.561 --> 31:15.929
What kind of crazy you is to do that?

31:15.963 --> 31:18.933
You want to be
the massa's bitch, you go ahead,

31:18.965 --> 31:20.435
but you leave me out of it.

31:20.467 --> 31:22.736
You don't talk to me like that.

31:36.082 --> 31:38.352
Come on! Do it!

31:40.186 --> 31:41.551
Do it!

31:47.752 --> 31:49.250
Why you do this?

31:53.833 --> 31:56.169
You know I ain't trying to hurt you.

31:56.725 --> 31:58.705
I love you, Stine.

31:59.359 --> 32:00.695
I love you.

33:22.289 --> 33:24.992
I heard you done helped
some of the girls around here.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.727
You ain't with child.

33:28.696 --> 33:30.231
<i>I ain't.</i>

33:30.655 --> 33:34.202
<i>I don't want to be... not ever.</i>

33:37.704 --> 33:40.574
I seen't you parading up

33:40.608 --> 33:42.944
at the big house like
you on a cake walk.

33:42.976 --> 33:46.175
Fishing for the massa's eye.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.583
Seem like growing a little, yellow weed

33:48.616 --> 33:50.399
exactly what you want.

33:51.343 --> 33:54.655
Get you a nice, comfy bed

33:54.687 --> 33:55.956
next to massa.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.592
I'd still be a slave,

33:57.625 --> 33:59.543
no matter where I sleep.

34:00.194 --> 34:03.664
I don't want the massa,
but that's what I get.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.200
And it's not just him.

34:06.519 --> 34:08.168
Them overseers.

34:08.567 --> 34:10.958
Some of them others in that field, too.

34:11.772 --> 34:14.108
Anybody who think they
could take a piece of me.

34:14.472 --> 34:16.275
I'm trying to protect myself,

34:16.503 --> 34:19.312
the only one trying.

34:19.344 --> 34:20.848
So I'm-a use what I got.

34:22.983 --> 34:26.063
You sad, pretty, little thing.

34:26.371 --> 34:28.274
You can't protect nothing.

34:28.764 --> 34:30.706
You control nothing.

34:31.158 --> 34:34.965
Your body ain't never been yours

34:34.996 --> 34:36.688
and never will be.

34:37.231 --> 34:40.467
But looks is all you got,

34:40.501 --> 34:43.018
so I suppose you better use 'em.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.975
You cut out your insides.

34:49.007 --> 34:50.577
That's the only way.

34:51.185 --> 34:52.879
You, too, of the massa seed.

34:52.911 --> 34:56.914
They blood is in you,
and it seep to the bone.

34:57.383 --> 35:00.707
Ain't no running from it.

35:03.089 --> 35:08.044
Your kin done sold you
an old and terrible lie.

35:08.685 --> 35:11.999
That you can survive this.

38:23.428 --> 38:24.537
Oh...

38:41.987 --> 38:43.956
Mm.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.092
Mr. Donahue?

43:04.040 --> 43:05.542
Go, go, go!

43:08.011 --> 43:10.448
We got you, we got you.

43:22.191 --> 43:23.961
We got you.

43:29.933 --> 43:31.935
Come on, come on!

43:35.872 --> 43:37.508
We got you.

43:38.808 --> 43:40.343
Come on.

43:45.883 --> 43:47.518
Come on!

43:47.551 --> 43:49.086
We got you, we got you.

43:49.118 --> 43:52.589
We got you, we got you, we got you.

43:52.622 --> 43:55.459
We got you, we got you.

44:16.981 --> 44:19.482
Jack... his death.

44:19.515 --> 44:20.751
How does it affect you?

44:20.783 --> 44:22.052
Did it affect you?

44:22.679 --> 44:23.921
Of course.

44:24.366 --> 44:26.189
You didn't seem to like him.

44:27.524 --> 44:29.126
I liked him.

44:29.158 --> 44:30.727
Not sure I respected him.

44:30.761 --> 44:33.097
He lacked critical thinking,
for sure, and manners,

44:33.129 --> 44:35.499
most of the time, but I
can give those a pass.

44:35.531 --> 44:37.981
The only thing I need
from my men is loyalty.

44:38.015 --> 44:39.770
That is non-negotiable.

44:39.803 --> 44:41.505
Yet you and Jack were always

44:41.537 --> 44:42.939
in a state of negotiation.

44:42.973 --> 44:45.047
Mm. Exactly.

44:45.376 --> 44:47.812
Didn't surprise me when
Smoke told me he had no family.

44:48.326 --> 44:52.015
I mean, he could fail me, not
get paid, pass out in a alley,

44:52.048 --> 44:54.341
and there's nothing there to
motivate him to do any better.

44:54.374 --> 44:56.820
So family men are ideal,
in terms of motivation.

44:56.854 --> 44:58.022
Sure.

44:58.665 --> 45:00.124
But you know what's better?

45:00.497 --> 45:01.959
My nigger catchers.

45:02.528 --> 45:04.095
They're motivated.

45:04.127 --> 45:05.763
The ones that were slaves themselves

45:05.796 --> 45:08.131
don't want to go back,
and the free ones,

45:08.165 --> 45:09.667
the ones with brains anyhow,

45:09.700 --> 45:11.202
know that I can send them into it anew,

45:11.234 --> 45:13.336
- they piss me off enough.
- Hey!

45:13.370 --> 45:15.167
Hold up, now!

45:15.872 --> 45:18.008
So is that the plan for the Black Rose?

45:18.042 --> 45:19.877
Turn her brethren on her?

45:21.377 --> 45:24.015
I can do better
in this unique circumstance.

45:38.495 --> 45:41.166
What makes this circumstance unique?

45:42.365 --> 45:44.701
There's one man I know
more motivated than anyone
