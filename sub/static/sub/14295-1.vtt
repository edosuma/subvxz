- I swear, if'n you don't
learn to share this honey...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.594
<i>I'm gonna give you a real whuppin:</i>

01:42.702 --> 01:45.967
Now go on!

01:58.952 --> 02:03.355
<i>- Is the doctor in?
- No doubt about it.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:07.415
- What's ailin' ya, Fat Elmer?
- I et too much cheese.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.426
Now I can't burp.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.897
Can ya fix me, Granny?

03:03.216 --> 03:06.049
<i>Dang.</i>

04:25.365 --> 04:28.260
Before I sign anything...

04:28.368 --> 04:30.802
I want to know how much money
we're talkin' about.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.803
Mr. Clampett, there's more petroleum
in your swamp...

04:32.905 --> 04:35.635
than there is in all of Kuwait.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.903
- That bad, huh?
- Mr. Clampett...

04:38.011 --> 04:43.449
you are sitting on the biggest
domestic oil strike in history.

04:43.549 --> 04:47.451
<i>And when you sign these contracts,
we're going to pay you one billion dollars.</i>

04:50.089 --> 04:52.956
Do you have anybody
who can advise you on these contracts?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.892
<i>Cousin jethro's a-comin'tomorrow night
for Sunday supper, Pa.</i>

04:57.997 --> 05:01.160
He's the one with the learnin'.
He went to school at Oxford.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.049
- Jethro.
- Yes, Ma?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.414
Did you fix those bare-as-bones brakes
like I told you?

05:19.519 --> 05:22.420
Of course.
I pulled 'em off yesterday.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.650
The new ones are
comin' in the mail next week.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.940
- Jethro!
- Howdy, Granny.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.500
Oh! You dadblamed
simpleminded yahoo!

05:46.612 --> 05:50.104
Your crack-bucket head's
emptier than last year's bird's nest.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.980
If your head was filled with dynamite...

05:53.086 --> 05:54.986
- Ow! Ow!
- You wouldn't know how to blow your nose!

05:55.088 --> 05:57.079
- You...
- Ow!

05:57.190 --> 05:59.215
- Granny! Ow! Granny!
- Just get out of my sight!

06:02.061 --> 06:03.892
<i>Now, jedediah...</i>

06:03.996 --> 06:06.396
you're fixin' to be the richest man
in this here county.

06:06.499 --> 06:11.801
Look at how you live. Why, your land's
overrun with snakes and skunks.

06:11.904 --> 06:15.237
<i>You got no TV, no telephone and no radio.</i>

06:17.243 --> 06:20.804
<i>You're right, Pearl.
We are a-livin'in paradise.</i>

06:20.913 --> 06:24.405
No, Jed!
Paradise is someplace like...

06:24.517 --> 06:26.417
Beverly Hills, Californy.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.079
<i>- They got swimmin'pools.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

06:29.188 --> 06:31.486
- And movie stars.
- And smog.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.560
What's a smog?

06:40.199 --> 06:42.963
I reckon it's a small hog.

06:43.069 --> 06:47.096
<i>Now, if you're not gonna think about yourself,
think about your daughter.</i>

06:47.206 --> 06:50.403
<i>You need to get remarried, jed,
and she needs a ma...</i>

06:50.510 --> 06:52.740
someone to teach her
womanly ways.

06:52.845 --> 06:57.407
<i>- She's runnin'wild, jed.
She's no different than a boy.</i>

06:57.517 --> 07:01.613
<i>Imagine that. Elly May
wearin'fancy dresses...</i>

07:01.721 --> 07:04.588
and actin' ladylike!

07:04.690 --> 07:08.649
<i>Well, that don't sound like much fun.</i>

07:11.264 --> 07:15.462
<i>Beverly Hills.</i>

07:17.637 --> 07:19.798
<i>Listen to what I'm sayin: jed.</i>

07:19.906 --> 07:22.374
<i>It would be the best thing for y'all.</i>

07:22.475 --> 07:25.911
<i>Just pack up all your belongin's
and move on out there.</i>

07:26.012 --> 07:29.948
<i>Jethro could drive you out
in his truck.</i>

07:30.049 --> 07:33.883
I ain't drivin' in no movin' vehicle
with no dunderhead.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.011
<i>I ain't no dunderhead.</i>

07:37.390 --> 07:41.326
- Come on! Put me down!
- Set him down.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.325
<i>- See what I mean?
- Who are you, mister?</i>

07:48.434 --> 07:51.665
Ozark Mountain Oil. Mr. Briggs sent me
to see if you'd signed the contract.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.864
- Oh, my.
- Elly May Clampett.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.572
Well, that's it.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.645
I've made my decision.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.845
For the good
of this here family...

08:03.950 --> 08:06.009
I'm a-movin' us to Beverly Hills.

08:09.088 --> 08:13.218
Now, don't you worry, Elly May.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.558
- We gonna take good care of your critters for ya.
- Okay, Sam. I know you will.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.825
Oh, Ma!

08:28.474 --> 08:32.102
What's all this I hear about you
not wantin' to go to Californy?

08:32.211 --> 08:34.441
I like it here.
Say what you will...

08:34.547 --> 08:37.778
but there ain't nothin' you can do
to get me off of this rockin' chair.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.947
<i>- I ain't goin' nowheres! Cut me loose!
- It's a long ride to Californy.</i>

08:43.054 --> 08:46.081
<i>Jedediah Clampett, I'm gonna skin you alive!</i>

08:46.192 --> 08:48.752
Hush up, Granny.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.954
Get goin', boy,
before she breaks loose.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.928
<i>I ain't a-goin:!</i>

09:11.350 --> 09:13.318
Watch your head, Granny.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.373
There's so many people
in this here town.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.775
<i>Goin' to take a long time to meet everybody.</i>

09:40.880 --> 09:43.781
Hey! Nice wheels, buddy!

09:43.883 --> 09:49.150
- Jethro, why do you think
that feller's pointin' at us?

09:49.255 --> 09:52.452
I reckon that's the way
they wave "howdy" in Californy.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.629
<i>- Has, uh...
- Uh.! Excuse us.!</i>

09:59.732 --> 10:01.757
Has escrow closed
on the Clampett estate?

10:01.867 --> 10:05.200
Yes, chief. With an offer
of 22 million in cash, it closed swiftly.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.204
And I must say,
it is inspirational...

10:07.306 --> 10:10.139
how you happened to find a place
for the Clampetts right next-door to your own.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.142
Hathaway, the people
who lived there...

10:12.244 --> 10:14.838
were my best friends and neighbors
for over 20 years.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.881
It's a shame they had
to file for bankruptcy.

10:16.983 --> 10:22.148
Yeah. I just hope my call to the I.R.S.
didn't have anything to do with it. Well.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.859
- Now, um, what time does their fight arrive?
- That's just it, chief.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.023
<i>- They're driving.
- Driving?</i>

10:34.133 --> 10:35.794
From Arkansas?

10:35.901 --> 10:38.131
I know it makes no sense whatsoever.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.535
Not to you, perhaps.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.870
But to a man with vision,
like myself...

10:42.975 --> 10:47.378
- That is a sign of daring, self-confidence, vigor.
- Of course, chief.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.347
<i>Hmm. Doesn't he look busy at work.</i>

10:53.452 --> 10:55.545
Tyler.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.818
- Would you step in here for a moment, please.
- Oh!

11:01.427 --> 11:04.760
<i>- Geez.
- It's an earthquake.!</i>

11:08.300 --> 11:09.892
<i>Oh.</i>

11:22.448 --> 11:26.680
- You wanted to consult with me?
- Sit down, Tyler. Relax.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.782
I have heard that you are quite excited
about the arrival of the Clampetts.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.519
I think that you and I,
together...

11:34.627 --> 11:38.723
can fully exploit the potential
of the Clampett financial portfolio.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.391
Hmm.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.765
You and I. The two of us.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.896
I've already taken the liberty of drawing up
the power of attorney papers.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.602
- Have you now?
- So I can write checks, arrange investments...

11:51.711 --> 11:53.872
<i>make international transactions.</i>

11:53.979 --> 11:56.573
- Really work the Clampett account.
- Hmm.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.206
We'll be quite the team, sir.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.478
Mmm.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.289
Tyler, you will personally
rescind, shred and burn...

12:05.391 --> 12:08.258
every paper you have drawn up
with regard to the Clampett account.

12:09.862 --> 12:13.389
- I'll be handling that account personally.
- Duly noted.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.660
And nice kick, sir.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.793
<i>Took me completely by surprise.</i>

12:19.739 --> 12:22.139
Tyler.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.802
- The Clampetts will not be badgered.
- Sir?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.675
They are not your common
garden-variety millionaires.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.649
<i>They are, in fact, billionaires.</i>

12:32.752 --> 12:37.121
By definition, people of,
uh, discrimination...

12:37.223 --> 12:40.590
discernment, great refinement.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.628
<i>Boy, howdy.!</i>

12:46.832 --> 12:49.596
Hey! Jethro, we's supposed
to go thataway.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.472
<i>Hey! You cut us off, you bunch of nothin's!</i>

13:07.219 --> 13:09.847
That's real nice, son.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.855
This here's what I carry.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.492
Okay. Go! Go, go!

13:19.131 --> 13:21.099
<i>Margaret!</i>

13:24.436 --> 13:26.404
Morgan, come in here
a minute, please.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.838
<i>Hi. I'm Doug Llewelyn, and welcome
to the People's Court.</i>

13:29.942 --> 13:32.342
<i>Where is your mother?</i>

13:32.444 --> 13:34.412
She's changing.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.913
That would be
too much to hope for.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.110
- Oh.
- Milburn, I'm sorry. I have to cancel our lunch.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.382
- What?
- I have to spend more quality time with Babette.

13:43.489 --> 13:48.722
Margaret, dear, we are trying to do more things
together... put the spark back, remember?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.194
You claim the defendant
has your dog?

13:51.297 --> 13:53.197
<i>- Um, well, actually...
- Yes or no?</i>

13:53.299 --> 13:55.824
- Yes, we do. - Morgan.
Morgan. - It's my dog.

13:55.935 --> 13:59.166
<i>- It's your dog?
- Yes. I raised this dog from a pup, and due to...</i>

14:01.407 --> 14:04.740
Morgan, I have a little job for you.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.746
- Ajob?
- Yes. J.D. Clampett has a daughter your age.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.975
Now, she's goin'
to high school with you.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.983
I want you
to show her around.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.781
- Just be her friend.
- Oh, man.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.322
You wanna pay me
to hang out with her?

14:18.424 --> 14:21.655
She must be a major bowwow.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.728
Son.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.854
Morgan.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.297
Close your eyes.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.630
Close your eyes.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.704
Now picture this.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.705
I cut off your allowance...

14:34.807 --> 14:36.707
Cancel your credit cards...

14:36.809 --> 14:38.936
And delete you from my will.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.070
Now, how do you see
your future?

14:42.181 --> 14:44.809
Grilling frozen cow parts
at Burger King?

14:46.318 --> 14:50.015
And people say you're stupid.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.454
Monday morning,
first period, 8:00 a. M...

14:52.558 --> 14:54.719
she'll be like the little sister
Mom thought would ruin her figure.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.961
<i>- The dog will go to the plaintiff,
Rusty.</i>

15:25.524 --> 15:28.084
Honey, I'm home.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.788
Why don't you come here and give your little
embezzling cowboy a ride around the bungalow.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.491
- No.
- Why not?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.798
'Cause I'm still living in this dump when I should
be living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.134
Laura, sweetheart.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.437
<i>Bungalows 3A, 3B and 3C
are in Los Angeles.</i>

15:44.543 --> 15:48.035
<i>We live in 3G
which, technically, is in Beverly Hills.</i>

15:48.147 --> 15:49.944
You're all talk, Tyler.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.108
You said we'd have
enough money this month...

15:52.217 --> 15:54.708
to buy me that little
baby sealskin coat.

15:54.820 --> 15:58.153
- We will.
- Promises, promises.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.157
<i>Sweetie, we will.</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:03.695
<i>J.D. Clampett, the billionaire,
just opened up an account at the bank.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:05.889
Who is this Clampett guy?

16:05.998 --> 16:08.466
If he's so rich, how come
I've never heard of him?

16:08.567 --> 16:12.298
Baby cakes, this guy's got more money
than he knows what to do with.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.498
Now, that's a problem
I think we can help him with.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.912
Stop the car, Jethro!

16:23.015 --> 16:24.915
They's a fresh kill in the road.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.178
- Can't just leave it there.
- You're right, Granny.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.811
Roadkill stew sounds
mighty good right now.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.984
Oh, no, you don't, you old coot! I seen it first!

16:36.095 --> 16:38.586
<i>- Milburn, call Westec Security.
- Well, I...</i>

16:38.697 --> 16:40.688
I'm sure there's enough for us all.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.529
Eww! How revolting.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.695
<i>Easy now, Granny.
They're probablyjust bein'neighborly...</i>

16:46.805 --> 16:49.740
like them nice folks we met
on that extry-wide road.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.106
Well, let's give 'em
a Californy howdy.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.105
<i>- Howdy, y'all.!
- Howdy.!</i>

16:56.215 --> 16:59.184
Milburn!

16:59.284 --> 17:01.252
Did you fip me off?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.149
You reckon we're at
the wrong spot, UncleJed?

17:40.259 --> 17:43.160
<i>Could be. Don't know.</i>

17:43.262 --> 17:45.890
It's the right address, Pa.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.990
Whee doggies!

18:28.707 --> 18:31.267
<i>The whole place looks brand-new.</i>

18:32.744 --> 18:35.872
Hey, UncleJed, there's
a whole 'nother house up here.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.554
<i>This is a big ol'house.</i>

18:43.655 --> 18:46.180
Why do you reckon
they got two sets of steps?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.384
That's easy.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.894
One's for goin' up.
The other's for goin' down.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.055
Oh.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.666
What a pretty critter.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.170
Hello, police?
This is Miss Jane Hathaway.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.241
I wish to report
the unlawful entry...

19:03.342 --> 19:05.970
of a gang of armed and dangerous
hooligans at the Clampett estate.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.842
518 Crestview Drive.

19:08.947 --> 19:13.680
- I need you here code three,
and I will be timing you.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.652
I think you got you
a new friend, Duke.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.550
<i>Cease and desist.!
Everyone.!</i>

19:21.660 --> 19:24.424
If I were you, sir,
I would yield, submit and capitulate.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.728
<i>What are you desperadoes
doing here?</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:32.565
- Well, it's a mighty long story.
- But he don't mind tellin' it.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.334
- Pa was a-huntin' one day with old Duke.
- Duke spotted this jackrabbit.

19:36.441 --> 19:40.036
- So I throws up my gun, and I takes my aim...
- Don't shoot!

19:40.145 --> 19:42.511
<i>Pardon, ma'am?</i>

19:45.150 --> 19:49.484
<i>Two minutes and 46 seconds.</i>

19:52.057 --> 19:55.083
<i>Go.! Go.! Go.!</i>

19:56.528 --> 19:58.962
<i>I need three men
over there on the south side.!</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:05.094
<i>Attention, inside.!
You're surrounded.!</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:07.968
<i>Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time.!</i>

20:08.073 --> 20:11.634
<i>- Don't shoot! Oh! They've taken me hostage!
- Attention, inside.!</i>

20:11.743 --> 20:15.144
Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time!

20:15.247 --> 20:17.374
<i>This is the Beverly Hills
Police Department.</i>

20:17.482 --> 20:19.382
Told you this warn't no house.

20:19.484 --> 20:23.045
<i>- You heard him. It's the police department.
- This is your last warning.!</i>

20:23.155 --> 20:26.056
All right!
Fire one in!

20:27.359 --> 20:29.793
<i>Look.</i>

20:29.895 --> 20:31.556
They's a-playin' kick the can.

20:46.044 --> 20:48.012
Move in!

20:51.683 --> 20:54.584
I knew we shouldn't have never left home.
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

20:54.686 --> 20:57.655
Right this way.
We've I.D. 'd them all.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.157
- Excellent.
- We want the wheels of justice to spin quickly.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.820
<i>These criminals must be
prosecuted and incarcerated...</i>

21:03.929 --> 21:05.829
before our client finds out
what happened.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.922
Exactly.

21:08.033 --> 21:11.332
The reputation of Milburn Drysdale is at stake.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.064
Would everyone turn
to the right, please.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.868
<i>Huh.! Hmm.! Pathetic.</i>

21:18.977 --> 21:22.105
Now we have, starting on the left,
a Jedediah Clampett.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.205
- Then, next to him, his daughter, Elly May.
- Huh?

21:24.316 --> 21:28.343
<i>And a Daisy Mae Moses, a. k. a. "Granny. "</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:31.115
<i>And a nephew, jethro Bodine.</i>

21:33.458 --> 21:36.689
<i>And some woman involved in a drive-by slapping.</i>

21:40.932 --> 21:43.400
Oh, chief. Chief. Are you okay?

21:43.502 --> 21:45.732
Chief. Quickly! Say something!

21:45.837 --> 21:48.533
Say something!

21:48.640 --> 21:53.373
You're fired!

21:53.478 --> 21:57.209
Mr. Clampett, sir!
I am deeply sorry...

21:57.316 --> 22:00.251
for any embarrassment
my former assistant might have caused you.

22:00.352 --> 22:03.321
- L-I...
- Yes, sir. L-I...

22:03.422 --> 22:06.084
I- I humbly apologize
for my egregious error.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.250
<i>And rest assured
that it will never happen again...</i>

22:08.360 --> 22:10.328
as I am no longer
in the employ of the bank.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.762
Chief, Mr. Drysdale,
I will clean out my desk at once.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.030
<i>Oh, dear.! Oh, please,
don't trouble yourselves.</i>

22:19.137 --> 22:21.196
Please, gentlemen. Oh. Oh, thank you.
Don't trouble yourselves.

22:21.306 --> 22:24.332
Oh, I'm... Thank you. Thank you so much.
Oh, thank... No.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.974
So, then everything is fine?

22:29.081 --> 22:32.847
Mr. Clampett, please don't
take your money from my bank.

22:32.951 --> 22:37.251
I'll do anything you want.
I'll contribute to charities, anything.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.790
I'll eat mud.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.859
That won't be necessary.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.726
All I want is for this here lady
to watch over my affairs.

22:45.831 --> 22:49.631
Me? You want me?

22:49.735 --> 22:51.896
Well, I reckon
you done what you done...

22:52.003 --> 22:54.563
'cause you didn't know
we was who we was.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.607
And if we hadn't have been
who we was...

22:56.708 --> 22:59.768
we'd have still been much obliged
for you a-doin' what you done.

23:01.012 --> 23:04.812
Mr. Clampett, I will work
very hard for you.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.781
I trust you will.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.445
<i>Is that all right with you,
Mr. Drysdale?</i>

23:09.554 --> 23:11.681
That's exactly what I'd do
in your situation.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.758
- So we got ourselves a deal.
- Ah!

23:15.994 --> 23:17.894
Absolutely!

23:17.996 --> 23:20.055
Yeah.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.135
<i>Just to show you
there's no hard feelin's...</i>

23:25.237 --> 23:27.762
<i>we'd like to invite you and your family
to Sunday supper.</i>

23:27.873 --> 23:31.502
- Thank you. We'll be there.
- It'll give me the opportunity to swap recipes with your wife.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.510
Oh, she'd love that.

23:37.682 --> 23:39.650
<i>Here you go.</i>

23:42.854 --> 23:46.847
- What-What are you doing?
- We're just payin' our respects.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.119
- You...
- Oh.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.718
Oh. Oh, no.
This is a limousine.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.162
<i>You'll be going home in this.</i>

23:54.266 --> 23:56.962
You take this, and I'll follow you
in my Rolls-Royce.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.637
<i>- There you go.
- Is that your car?</i>

24:01.740 --> 24:04.903
- Yes, it is.
- Ain't that fancy!

24:05.010 --> 24:07.740
Can I drive it?

24:07.846 --> 24:11.282
You drive my $180,000
Rolls-Royce?

24:14.152 --> 24:17.212
Uh, well, of course you can, son.
I think that's a great idea.

24:17.322 --> 24:19.222
Hot dog!

24:48.887 --> 24:50.821
Howdy!

24:51.857 --> 24:55.384
<i>Oh, isn't this exciting?</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:57.894
Elly May Clampett,
sit down!

25:02.501 --> 25:05.095
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

25:05.203 --> 25:07.569
Hello.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.867
Let Mr... Let Mr. Clampett know...

25:09.975 --> 25:12.842
that the full weight of the bank
is ready to help them.

25:12.944 --> 25:16.277
- Yes, chief.
- She thinks she's talkin' to somebody.

25:16.381 --> 25:19.942
<i>Ain't even a cord there.</i>

25:20.051 --> 25:22.747
Like real estate, bonds, securities.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.721
Whatever it is he wants,
it's his.

25:25.824 --> 25:30.090
Mr. Drysdale wants you to know that the bank
is ready to help in any way that it can.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.028
There's one reason and one reason only
I moved out here.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.966
I'm lookin' to get hitched.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.967
Chief, he says
he wants to get hitched.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.039
- "Hitched"?
- Married.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.200
- Married?
- Chief, that's what I said.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.269
Miss Hathaway, if...
if Clampett wants a wife...

25:49.381 --> 25:51.815
tell him that you will
personally find him one.

25:51.917 --> 25:56.047
Oh, chief, capable as I may be,
matrimonial brokering is...

25:56.154 --> 25:58.054
Is now one of your specialties.

25:58.156 --> 26:01.250
Congratulations, Miss Hathaway,
and good luck.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.696
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.289
No problem.
Uh, Mr. Clampett.

26:09.401 --> 26:14.065
<i>Just exactly what
are you looking for in a fiancée?</i>

26:14.172 --> 26:16.572
A "fiancée"?

26:16.675 --> 26:19.667
<i>"Fiancée"is French
for the person you intend to marry.</i>

26:19.778 --> 26:22.303
Well, I'm lookin'
for a refined lady...

26:22.414 --> 26:25.008
<i>to help me
raise my daughter, Elly May.</i>

26:25.116 --> 26:27.584
Aw, Pa,
I'm already raised up.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.088
And refined.

26:32.190 --> 26:35.125
- Ah.
- Elly May, don't spit from a movin' vehicle.

26:36.461 --> 26:38.622
Wait till it stops.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.537
<i>Jethro, save some for our guests.</i>

26:50.875 --> 26:53.036
<i>Here you go, Unclejed.</i>

26:59.618 --> 27:01.950
I think old Duke
is sweet on your critter.

27:02.053 --> 27:05.955
<i>She's not a critter.
She's a champion French "Barbonet. "</i>

27:06.057 --> 27:10.619
And her purebred puppies
are gonna be worth $3,000 each.

27:10.729 --> 27:13.459
<i>Uh, son, what, uh...
What do you do?</i>

27:13.565 --> 27:15.692
Don't know.
What do you do?

27:16.768 --> 27:18.668
Oh, I'm just
president of a bank.

27:18.770 --> 27:22.137
Wow. UncleJed, can I
be a president too?

27:22.240 --> 27:26.700
Now, Jethro, that's a mighty disrespectful
thing to say to Mr. Drysdale.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.508
- No.
- Ask him if you can be vice president.

27:30.615 --> 27:34.813
<i>Vice president.</i>

27:34.919 --> 27:37.319
Uh-huh.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.998
Vice president.
Mm-hmm. I think so.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.233
We can... We can always use another good man.

27:57.342 --> 28:02.211
<i>Hoo-whee. I'm gonna get me
a fancy offiice and a pretty secretary.</i>

28:02.313 --> 28:06.409
<i>There's them bells again.</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:10.579
<i>Jethro, I bet you there's somebody
standin'at that front door right now.</i>

28:14.993 --> 28:17.928
If I was you,
I'd eat real quick whilst he's gone.

28:18.029 --> 28:22.125
Oh, that's good.
Margaret, why don't you help yourself, dear.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.963
<i>- Oh, good Lord.
- What is it?</i>

28:29.007 --> 28:31.635
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi. I'm Woodrow Tyler.

28:31.743 --> 28:34.769
- I'm here to seeJed Clampett.
- Well, come on in.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.182
No, no. No.

28:42.420 --> 28:46.720
<i>- Tyler. Well, what brings you here?
- Sir, hello.</i>

28:46.825 --> 28:51.558
<i>We took up a collection to buy these
beautiful flowers for our newest clients.</i>

28:51.663 --> 28:54.063
Welcome to Beverly Hills.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.258
<i>Well, thank you, sonny.</i>

28:56.367 --> 29:02.237
Tyler, can the ham. Just introduce yourself
and get out of here, okay?

29:02.340 --> 29:05.434
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Howdy!

29:08.246 --> 29:12.080
Elly May Clampett!

29:12.183 --> 29:15.152
<i>- He was fixin' to bite my hand.
- Well, stand him up.</i>

29:18.723 --> 29:22.124
- Tyler, apologize.
- My fault completely, Mr. Clampett.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.922
<i>I moved too quickly.</i>

29:24.028 --> 29:27.520
You have a beautiful daughter...
and very strong.

29:27.632 --> 29:30.465
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?

29:30.568 --> 29:33.594
What could help Elly May
be as refined as you?

29:33.705 --> 29:36.606
Well, I went to
finishing school in France.

29:36.708 --> 29:41.008
<i>No one understands refinement and
sophistication better than the French.</i>

29:41.112 --> 29:45.310
Hmm. Do you think we ought to
move ourselves to France?

29:45.416 --> 29:48.112
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. No, she doesn't.

29:48.219 --> 29:51.711
Actually, you can find a good French tutor
that'll come right to your home.

29:53.224 --> 29:56.455
<i>I don't wanna change.
I just wanna be who I am.</i>

29:56.561 --> 29:59.621
<i>- And I ain't goin'to no France.!
- Oh, my.</i>

30:00.732 --> 30:03.292
<i>Excuse me.</i>

30:03.401 --> 30:05.995
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?

30:06.104 --> 30:08.038
<i>If you ain't gonna eat them vittles,
can I have 'em?</i>

30:09.207 --> 30:12.540
<i>Of course you can, son.
Bon appétit.</i>

30:12.644 --> 30:14.612
Thank you.

30:23.087 --> 30:26.079
Elly May, come on down here.

30:31.095 --> 30:34.587
<i>- How'd you know where I was, Pa?
- 'Cause ever since you could walk...</i>

30:34.699 --> 30:37.759
you've been climbin' trees
and cuddlin' with your critters.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.710
It's high time you started thinkin'
about changin' some things.

30:52.817 --> 30:55.809
You need to start wearin' dresses
and fixin' up nice.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.151
But, Pa,
folks would call me a sissy.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.817
It ain't sissy for girls
to act like girls.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.156
Ever since your ma died,
I done what I knew best...

31:07.265 --> 31:09.699
and raised you up like a boy...

31:09.801 --> 31:12.292
roughhousin', fishin', fightin'.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.997
Yeah. That stuff's fun.

31:15.106 --> 31:19.634
Elly, nature made you a girl,
and here lately...

31:19.744 --> 31:21.769
she's been gettin' more
and more positive about it.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.780
Aw, Pa.

31:26.651 --> 31:29.313
Every time
I look into your eyes...

31:29.420 --> 31:31.320
I can see your ma there.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.628
Was my ma refined?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.721
Oh, yes.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.266
She was a real genteel lady.

31:45.870 --> 31:50.000
I miss her so much...
even now.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.941
I wanna be
just like my ma was.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.477
I reckon I do need somebody
to teach me the ways.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.143
Yeah, reckon you do.

32:04.188 --> 32:07.919
And now I got the means
to make that happen.

32:20.305 --> 32:24.469
Tyler, don't you have anything
better to do today?

32:24.575 --> 32:28.170
I just thought you'd wanna know more
about the richest dumb guy in America.

32:28.279 --> 32:32.443
<i>- He's a hayseed, a hillbilly.
- Mm!</i>

32:32.550 --> 32:34.609
<i>So this Clampett guy
should be easy, huh?</i>

32:34.719 --> 32:38.177
Yes, but we better do it fast
before he gets married.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.315
Married? Tyler,
Clampett's getting married?

32:41.426 --> 32:44.862
No, but he wants to.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.863
<i>- He's a horny old goat lookin' for some action?
- Nah.</i>

32:51.970 --> 32:53.801
He's just looking for a refined lady...

32:53.905 --> 32:56.533
<i>- to help raise his hellcat daughter, Elly May.
- Hmm.</i>

32:56.641 --> 33:00.805
<i>But he did seem interested when somebody
brought up the idea of a French tutor.</i>

33:00.912 --> 33:04.245
Hmm. A French tutor.

33:20.932 --> 33:24.732
<i>Bonjour.
My name is Laurette Voleur...</i>

33:24.836 --> 33:28.237
and I am a...
French governess.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.569
<i>Well, come on in, ma'am.</i>

33:33.511 --> 33:35.843
<i>Bonjour.
I am going door-to-door...</i>

33:35.947 --> 33:38.711
to see if anyone
needs my services.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.613
<i>- My business card.
- "Mademoiselle. "</i>

33:40.718 --> 33:44.279
"Mademoiselle... "

33:44.389 --> 33:48.189
- Sorry, ma'am. I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

33:50.495 --> 33:55.956
- Yep.
- There is not a young woman in the house...

33:56.067 --> 33:59.594
who is perhaps a bit, uh, unruly?

34:01.139 --> 34:04.302
Not that I can think of,
but, then again, we just moved here.

34:04.409 --> 34:08.469
Nobody in need of refinement
and sophistication?

34:11.549 --> 34:15.542
No. Maybe you oughta
try the neighbors.

34:15.652 --> 34:20.420
Oh, well, I am so sorry
to bother you.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.426
<i>I will be going now.</i>

34:24.862 --> 34:26.887
Well, what's the problem, ma'am?

34:26.998 --> 34:31.935
I was just hoping that my services
would be needed, but...

34:32.036 --> 34:35.301
- Well, what do you do?
- I teach, um... how do you say this...

34:35.406 --> 34:40.775
oh, rambunctious teenage girls
how to be more ladylike and proper.

34:43.347 --> 34:47.612
Well, dog my cats. You know,
Mrs. Drysdale was just telling us...

34:47.717 --> 34:50.652
about how the French was the best
at finishing a gal out.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.918
<i>Oui, they are. They are
the very, very best...</i>

34:54.025 --> 34:57.859
<i>at making a woman a woman.</i>

34:57.962 --> 35:00.829
Hey. I just thought of somethin'.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.832
Maybe she could help
with Elly May.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.494
Oh.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.606
Here, Rascal.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.874
Yeah.

35:17.982 --> 35:21.383
You like swimmin'
in this cement pond, don't you?

35:21.486 --> 35:23.750
<i>You like it too, Frankie?</i>

35:23.855 --> 35:25.823
<i>Takin'that duck for a swim?</i>

35:28.059 --> 35:33.224
And over here by the cement pond
is my daughter Elly.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.322
Elly, say hello to Miss Laurette.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.958
<i>- Howdy, Miss Laurette.
- Bonjour, Elly May.</i>

35:38.069 --> 35:39.969
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.971
I was thinkin',
every day after school...

35:42.073 --> 35:45.042
<i>maybe Miss Laurette
could help teach you to be a lady.</i>

35:45.143 --> 35:47.043
<i>- How about that?
- Okay.</i>

35:47.145 --> 35:50.080
Spanky likes you.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.809
Not as much as I like him.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.422
<i>Go on, now,
and stay out of trouble.</i>

35:59.657 --> 36:02.888
I finally figured
this game out, Spanky.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.895
<i>You take this ball...</i>

36:05.997 --> 36:09.057
you put it down
this here gully.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.761
It rolls down yonder.

36:11.869 --> 36:15.361
Then you hurl yourself
down this slippery gully...

36:15.473 --> 36:19.341
and see how many of them there
snake-bashin' clubs...

36:19.443 --> 36:22.901
you can knock down...
before the ball gets there.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.840
What a stupid idiot.

36:27.952 --> 36:30.250
Did you say somethin', ma'am?

36:30.354 --> 36:34.017
What a stupendous intellect.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.320
That's 'cause I graduated
the sixth grade, ma'am.

36:36.427 --> 36:38.696
<i>Only took three years.</i>

37:05.623 --> 37:08.922
Now, Elly May,
sit straight, chin up...

37:09.026 --> 37:13.486
and try to practice looking interested
when people are boring you.

37:22.673 --> 37:25.574
<i>Ah, greetings, Mr. Clampett.</i>

37:25.676 --> 37:27.644
<i>- Well, howdy, Miss Jane.
- Hello, Elly May.</i>

37:27.745 --> 37:30.111
Miss Jane, this here
is Miss Laurette Voleur.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.911
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle Laurette.
Comment allez-vous?</i>

37:35.019 --> 37:36.919
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.

37:37.021 --> 37:40.957
- I must only speak the English in front of Elly May.
- Of course.

37:41.058 --> 37:44.994
<i>Uh, Mr. Clampett, drawing
from Commerce Bank clientele...</i>

37:45.096 --> 37:48.532
I have selected some preliminary
bridal prospects for you.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.966
<i>Oh.! Oh, dear.! Oh, my goodness.!</i>

37:52.069 --> 37:55.368
<i>Mon Dieu.!
How clumsy of me. I'm so sorry.</i>

37:55.473 --> 37:57.703
Oh. Oh, it's no... no problem.

37:57.808 --> 38:01.471
No problem whatsoever.
At the bank, I have these in triplicate.

38:01.579 --> 38:06.039
- I shall return.
- I'll walk you out, Miss Hathaway.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.050
Why, thank you, Jethro.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.279
<i>So, Mr. Clampett...</i>

38:10.388 --> 38:12.788
<i>perhaps we should discuss
my, uh, weekly salary?</i>

38:19.830 --> 38:22.162
Shoo!

38:22.266 --> 38:26.225
Shoo!

38:32.843 --> 38:37.303
Shoo, cow. Excuse me, I'm just going to
reach over here and press this button.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.406
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

38:39.517 --> 38:41.985
Can anyone hear me?

38:42.086 --> 38:44.748
- Yeah.
- Can somebody help me?

38:44.855 --> 38:48.052
- Hello?
- Miss Hathaway?

38:48.159 --> 38:51.060
How's it feel to live in Beverly Hills?

38:51.162 --> 38:54.563
- Hello?
- I can hear you. Where are you?

38:54.665 --> 38:57.725
Please, can somebody
let me out of here?

38:57.835 --> 39:00.702
I am trapped inside the wall.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.569
Hello? Hello?

39:03.674 --> 39:06.268
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Just stay put, Miss Hathaway. I'll get ya out.</i>

39:06.377 --> 39:07.742
Hello?

39:08.946 --> 39:10.846
Watch your head.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.385
Miss Hathaway?

39:22.927 --> 39:24.622
Yoo-hoo!

39:28.499 --> 39:31.696
I'm in. This is gonna be
easier than I thought.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.736
So, they bought the French thing?

39:33.838 --> 39:37.035
<i>Mais oui.
They're bumpkins.</i>

39:37.141 --> 39:39.109
It's a crime
they have so much money.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.043
It's worse than a foreigner
winning the lottery.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.478
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.574
First, I'll lure in Clampett.
That'll be easy.

39:47.685 --> 39:52.281
Next, I'll take Elly May
and slap on a little window dressing.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.791
Make him think I turned her into a real lady.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.384
Then, when the time
is just right...

39:58.496 --> 40:00.930
I'll play one off the other
and... wham!

40:01.031 --> 40:05.066
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- You're not gonna sleep with him, are you?

40:05.169 --> 40:07.637
- That's not your problem.
- Okay, Laura?

40:07.738 --> 40:10.468
I got my hand on your butt.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.565
Okay. Hold on.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.837
I got someone on call waiting.

40:14.945 --> 40:18.039
Hello? Hello?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.981
It was nobody. Okay, now.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.181
I got my hand on your butt,
and I'm squeezing.

40:26.290 --> 40:29.088
Tyler!
Get your hand off my butt.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.991
- Mr. Drysdale!
- Get a pencil and write this down.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.030
Yes, Mr. Drysdale.

40:34.131 --> 40:37.259
Right. Uh-huh.
I can do that.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.454
Howdy, I'm Elly May.
You must be Mr. Drysdale's son.

41:08.599 --> 41:11.397
Well, thanks for picking me up.
Is this here your car?

41:16.273 --> 41:20.573
Are we goin' to school,
or are we just goin' to stand here all day?

41:26.250 --> 41:29.913
- Hey, y'all. Howdy.
- She's with me.

41:30.020 --> 41:32.147
<i>Heck, Morgan, I'm tryin' to be friendly-like...</i>

41:32.256 --> 41:34.884
but these folks don't seem
to want to say howdy back.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.187
- They sure are shy.
- So what?

41:37.294 --> 41:39.489
Elly May, who cares?
They're losers.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.690
Not one of them is worth
over 300 million.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.892
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Well, if it isn't Morgan...</i>

41:44.001 --> 41:46.435
spelled big "M,"
little "organ. "

41:46.537 --> 41:50.530
- We've gotta go.
- Not so fast, bank boy. Cough up your lunch money now.

41:50.641 --> 41:53.735
All I have is $400
in traveler's checks.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.836
So just sign them
and hand them over.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.347
Jake, show these two what happened
to the last guy who didn't pay up.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.080
Well, I can wire the money
to your account.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.182
Before the close
of the business day.

42:11.795 --> 42:14.525
I don't see why you
had to give anything to that gorilla.

42:14.632 --> 42:17.226
Well, that gorilla
is the captain of the wrestling team.

42:17.334 --> 42:20.394
Wow. I never wrestled a team before.

42:20.504 --> 42:25.237
- Well, 'lessen you count the McCarter triplets.
- Cappuccino?

42:25.342 --> 42:27.367
- What?
- Two.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.914
Thank you, Tiffany.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.251
<i>This here electronic whittler
works real fine.</i>

42:42.192 --> 42:44.626
Why, hello, Jethro.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.424
Well, howdy, Miss Hathaway.

42:48.966 --> 42:51.901
My, don't you look strapping
in your new business suit.

42:52.002 --> 42:56.996
- Armani?
- No. I'm pretty sure it's wool. Sure does itch like wool.

42:58.909 --> 43:01.810
- Miss Hathaway?
- Oh, no, no. We're colleagues.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.745
Call meJane.
MeJane, you Jethro.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.751
Okay. Okay, Miss Hathaway.

43:10.854 --> 43:14.449
Can I get one of these
electronic whittlers for UncleJed?

43:14.558 --> 43:17.925
<i>- It's his birthday coming up real soon.
- Let me make a note of that.</i>

43:18.028 --> 43:21.122
And speaking of your UncleJed,
back to the job at hand...

43:21.231 --> 43:23.961
- Finding him a suitable wife.
- Can I help?

43:24.068 --> 43:27.265
Heck, back in the hollow, my ma
was the best matchmaker around.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.771
- Is that so?
- Uh-huh.

43:29.873 --> 43:34.367
First thing she'd do is get
the back-fence gossips start a-jawin'.

43:34.478 --> 43:36.378
Why, we could drop some
items in the trades.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.381
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

43:39.483 --> 43:42.646
And then she'd...
What'd she do?

43:42.753 --> 43:46.450
<i>She'd hang a sign
on the church bulletin board.</i>

43:46.557 --> 43:49.890
Maybe we can get
a big bulletin board.

43:49.994 --> 43:52.326
No, no. We'd better be
a bit more discreet.

43:52.429 --> 43:55.330
<i>Tell me, what are your
uncle's favorite things?</i>

43:55.432 --> 43:57.332
Shoot, that's easy.

43:57.434 --> 44:00.801
<i>- He likes smoked crawdads.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

44:00.904 --> 44:02.872
Sowbelly and hand-slung chitterlings.

44:02.973 --> 44:05.339
And sponge cake.

44:05.442 --> 44:07.569
Besides food, Jethro.

44:07.678 --> 44:12.206
- Oh. He likes people who don't waste nothin'.
- Oh, go on.

44:12.316 --> 44:16.719
And his favorite song is
"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" by Hank Williams.

44:16.820 --> 44:20.017
- Yes!
- Yes, ma'am.

45:17.347 --> 45:19.247
<i>Entrez.</i>

45:24.488 --> 45:27.423
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

45:27.524 --> 45:29.424
is that Hank Williams I hear?

45:29.526 --> 45:31.494
I'm sorry.
It must be too loud.

45:31.595 --> 45:33.722
- I will...
- No, no.

45:33.831 --> 45:36.925
I was just listening to it
while repairing this old dress...

45:37.034 --> 45:40.094
and, uh, waiting for
my sponge cake to bake.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.138
You're cookin' a sponge cake?

45:42.239 --> 45:45.470
<i>Oui.
It is my spécialité.</i>

45:45.576 --> 45:48.602
<i>I love this music.</i>

45:49.747 --> 45:51.647
It makes me want to dance.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.980
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

46:37.327 --> 46:41.263
<i>You are a fine dancer...</i>

46:41.365 --> 46:44.163
and a very attractive man.

46:44.268 --> 46:47.465
<i>Whomever Miss Hathaway
finds for you to marry...</i>

46:47.571 --> 46:49.698
is going to be
a very happy woman.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.241
Well, thank you, ma'am.

46:52.342 --> 46:56.540
And all women know
"a-penis" is hard to find.

46:59.249 --> 47:02.446
- Excuse me?
- "A-penis. "

47:05.189 --> 47:07.885
Oh, happiness!

47:07.991 --> 47:09.652
Well, uh...

47:09.760 --> 47:11.990
I've disturbed
your work enough, ma'am.

47:24.541 --> 47:26.839
Jethro, have you considered
getting a new car?

47:26.944 --> 47:31.381
Nope, but I told UncleJed we should slap
a new coat of paint on this'n.

47:31.481 --> 47:33.745
But he said just
'cause we had money...

47:33.851 --> 47:35.978
we didn't need to go
showin' it off.

47:36.086 --> 47:38.054
I was just thinking,
oh, you should, you should.

47:38.155 --> 47:41.215
You would look so good
in a big new fashy car.

47:41.325 --> 47:44.761
<i>Big fashy car, huh? Maybe.</i>

47:46.396 --> 47:49.229
Yep.

47:49.333 --> 47:53.531
Okay, Miss Jane,
I'm 'bout ready to pull over.

47:53.637 --> 47:56.333
You are so impossibly romantic.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.704
Close your eyes.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.709
Hot diggity dog!

48:00.811 --> 48:03.678
Okay, now,
keep 'em closed.

48:03.780 --> 48:06.442
How charmingly old-fashioned.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.916
Mm.

48:09.019 --> 48:11.146
Open your eyes
and look up.

48:12.656 --> 48:14.624
<i>Ain't she pretty?</i>

48:16.193 --> 48:18.218
Oh, my God!

48:18.328 --> 48:20.796
The chief is going to kill me.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.376
<i>We'll be back
with the financial news after this message.</i>

48:34.478 --> 48:36.912
<i>Howdy.
I'm jethro Bodine.</i>

48:37.014 --> 48:39.175
I'm talkin' to all
you ladies out there.

48:39.283 --> 48:41.410
<i>Are you looking for
the perfect husband?</i>

48:41.518 --> 48:43.418
<i>Then considerjed Clampett.</i>

48:43.520 --> 48:46.148
Yes, Jed is rated triple A's...

48:46.256 --> 48:50.420
for a-ttractive, a-vailable,
and a-billionaire.

48:50.527 --> 48:53.587
So come on down
to the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills...

48:53.697 --> 48:55.756
<i>and see me, jethro Bodine,
vice president.</i>

48:55.866 --> 48:57.766
<i>- Dear, what's the matter?
- And remember.</i>

48:57.868 --> 49:01.668
I'm not onlyJed's wife finder.
I'm also his nephew.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.608
I'm ruined.

49:37.574 --> 49:39.041
Oh!

49:52.255 --> 49:54.951
Howdy.

49:56.126 --> 49:58.253
Thank you.

49:58.362 --> 50:02.059
Hathaway, you are embarrassing
this institution!

50:02.165 --> 50:04.099
<i>This is a carnival.</i>

50:04.201 --> 50:07.432
What kind of a numbskull would
think up a harebrained scheme like this?

50:07.537 --> 50:09.596
That'd be me, Mr. Drysdale.

50:09.706 --> 50:11.401
Y- Your idea.
Well...

50:11.508 --> 50:14.341
<i>Well, it's brilliant.!</i>

50:14.444 --> 50:16.844
Insightful. Cutting edge.

50:16.947 --> 50:19.040
<i>You're a born leader, son.</i>

50:19.149 --> 50:22.641
We've have had 1,215 women
respond to the ad.

50:22.753 --> 50:24.721
- And two men.
- Wh...

50:24.821 --> 50:28.882
Once I've entered the data into the computer,
worked my magic... presto.

50:28.992 --> 50:33.622
- We will narrow them down to a precious few.
- Send in the next five.

50:33.730 --> 50:37.359
Oh, uh, Hathaway, uh,
you're not validating parking, are you?

50:37.467 --> 50:39.367
Parking? Um...

50:39.469 --> 50:41.767
Oh, that was my idea too,
Mr. Drysdale.

50:41.872 --> 50:45.968
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
if I may say so.

50:46.076 --> 50:48.567
<i>Let's see, uh...</i>

50:48.678 --> 50:52.205
<i>1,215 women... and two men.</i>

50:52.315 --> 50:54.442
<i>At a dollar and a half
every 15 minutes.</i>

50:54.551 --> 50:57.418
Ah, well, that's only
gonna cost me 5...

50:57.521 --> 51:00.046
5-5-5-5... $5,000.

51:00.157 --> 51:03.217
Well...

51:09.366 --> 51:11.891
<i>- Bonjour, Jethro.
- Well, howdy, Miss Laurette.</i>

51:12.002 --> 51:13.902
What is all of this?

51:14.004 --> 51:17.405
Miss Jane said a big fancy car
would be more suitin' to my personality...

51:17.507 --> 51:20.533
so I'm fixin' on makin' one
out of my truck.

51:20.644 --> 51:24.239
Personally, if it would have been me,
I would have just bought a new one.

51:24.347 --> 51:26.747
But... carry on.

51:29.820 --> 51:31.845
What a moron.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.291
Hey, organ,
what are you doin' here?

51:36.393 --> 51:38.258
- You come here to wrestle me?
- No.

51:38.361 --> 51:40.261
Or did you just come here
to kiss the gym foor?

51:40.363 --> 51:42.991
Come on, Morgan, just kiss it.
Come on, kiss it.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.091
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

51:45.202 --> 51:47.534
And what business
is it of yours, baby?

51:47.637 --> 51:51.198
<i>What are you doing here, anyway,
corn pone?</i>

51:51.308 --> 51:53.970
I came by to join
the wrestlin' team.

51:54.077 --> 51:55.977
I don't wrestle girls,
at least not in the gym...

51:56.079 --> 51:57.979
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

51:58.081 --> 52:00.072
- Good. Then let's get started.
- Whoa!

52:02.619 --> 52:04.644
<i>- I'm gonna kill you!
- I'm goin' to kill you.!</i>

52:04.754 --> 52:06.688
No one is going to kill
anyone here!

52:06.790 --> 52:08.758
Not without a signed
permission slip from home.

52:08.859 --> 52:11.453
<i>- Got it?
- Got it, Coach.</i>

52:13.430 --> 52:15.830
So, Jethro...

52:15.932 --> 52:19.163
<i>building on your visionary plan
for finding your uncle's wife...</i>

52:19.269 --> 52:23.171
I've... I've created
this rather modest database program.

52:23.273 --> 52:26.333
<i>I've cross-referenced the applicants...</i>

52:26.443 --> 52:30.345
<i>against the parameters
you indicated he desired...</i>

52:30.447 --> 52:34.315
by specifying the search criteria
into functional groupings...

52:34.417 --> 52:37.909
<i>and selecting the fiield values...</i>

52:38.021 --> 52:40.182
through the use
of embedded commands...

52:40.290 --> 52:44.522
and, of course,
basic Boolean algebra.

52:47.597 --> 52:51.897
Miss Jane, I have no idea
what you just said.

52:54.905 --> 52:59.399
Oh, Jethro, you are
so delightfully... primitive.

53:02.646 --> 53:05.774
Uh, Miss Hathaway, would you
step into my office, please.

53:05.882 --> 53:08.942
<i>- And bring the, uh, the Arlington file.
- Yes, sir.</i>

53:09.052 --> 53:11.077
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Drysdale...</i>

53:11.188 --> 53:14.180
since I have trained three Kentucky Derby
winners for other people...

53:14.291 --> 53:18.250
<i>it seems a logical extension that I'd want
to own and operate my own stud farm...</i>

53:18.361 --> 53:20.056
Arlington Acres.

53:20.163 --> 53:23.155
Well, it's just...
It's just a very exciting idea.

53:23.266 --> 53:26.235
Then you agree that his net worth
and rural background...

53:26.336 --> 53:28.827
makeJed Clampett
the perfect partner for such a venture.

53:28.939 --> 53:32.375
Absolutely. You and Clampett,
partners in a stud farm.

53:32.475 --> 53:35.410
<i>- I think it's a wonderful idea.
- So you'll call him and arrange for us to meet?</i>

53:35.512 --> 53:37.742
You bet I will.

53:37.847 --> 53:40.714
- I'm sure he can't wait to see you.
- Oh.

53:40.817 --> 53:44.412
In fact, as soon as you leave, I'm going
to call Mr. Clampett on the phone.

53:44.521 --> 53:46.887
- Ah! This is very exciting.
- Isn't it?

53:46.990 --> 53:49.788
Yeah.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.487
<i>But, chief,
you specifiically told me...</i>

53:52.596 --> 53:55.827
that you did not want Mr. Clampett
involved in such a risky venture.

53:55.932 --> 53:57.866
Exactly.
Shred and burn that.

53:57.968 --> 54:00.459
<i>And don't ever let that lady
back in this offiice.</i>

54:00.570 --> 54:03.061
It went fantastically.

54:03.173 --> 54:07.041
Mr. Drysdale said I would
be a perfect partner for Mr. Clampett.

54:07.143 --> 54:09.907
Yes. I'll tell you more
when I get back. Bye.

54:12.882 --> 54:16.978
Excuse me, ma'am. If Mr. Drysdale thinks
you'd be perfect for my UncleJed...

54:17.087 --> 54:20.488
I can take you over
to meet him right now.

54:20.590 --> 54:23.991
- Wonderful!
- Come on.

54:24.094 --> 54:26.688
I think you're gonna
like Miss Arlington.

54:26.796 --> 54:29.526
Miss Jane picked her out
with her computer-datin' base.

54:29.633 --> 54:32.602
Then Mr. Drysdale
personally approved her.

54:32.702 --> 54:35.330
Computer-datin' base, huh?

54:35.438 --> 54:38.305
What'll they think of next?

54:38.408 --> 54:42.174
<i>- Hello, Miss Arlington.
- Mr. Clampett.</i>

54:42.279 --> 54:45.908
Well, gee, uh, I don't know
quite how to begin.

54:46.016 --> 54:49.008
Then let me start.

54:49.119 --> 54:53.351
I know, by just looking at you,
you are the perfect man for my stud farm.

54:54.758 --> 54:58.194
- Stud farm?
- If it makes it any easier for you...

54:58.295 --> 55:02.527
I am willing to take on
multiple partners.

55:02.632 --> 55:05.897
Multiple partners.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.539
Uh, no offense, ma'am...

55:11.641 --> 55:14.735
but I'm afraid I'd find that just
a tad uncomfortable.

55:16.846 --> 55:18.837
Well, what if it was with somebody
you really trusted...

55:18.948 --> 55:20.848
like Mr. Drysdale?

55:22.319 --> 55:24.219
I don't think this is
the sort of thing...

55:24.321 --> 55:26.881
Mr. Drysdale would want
to be involved in.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.185
Oh, well, you should
have seen his face...

55:29.292 --> 55:32.159
when I showed him the pictures
of what I have in mind.

55:32.262 --> 55:35.231
- He was very excited.
- I don't doubt that.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.028
Would you like to see the pictures?
They're very detailed.

55:38.134 --> 55:40.500
Not just yet!

55:40.603 --> 55:42.571
Don't you think we're
movin' awful fast?

55:42.672 --> 55:47.974
Oh, not as far
as I'm concerned, Mr. Clampett.

55:48.078 --> 55:51.070
I've got my license,
and I'm ready to breed.

55:53.049 --> 55:55.517
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

55:55.618 --> 55:57.745
I could use a glass
of iced tea.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.952
- Yourself?
- Sure.

56:01.057 --> 56:04.515
I'm learnin' Elly May to ride my motorcycle!

56:04.627 --> 56:07.994
<i>- How do you stop this thing?
- I'm gonna tan your hide.!</i>

56:08.098 --> 56:11.932
You're doin' real good.
Now put on the brakes!

56:12.035 --> 56:13.935
<i>- Granny?
- Whoa.!</i>

56:14.037 --> 56:15.937
I'm gonna get you!

56:19.008 --> 56:21.135
Granny! Watch your head!

56:25.248 --> 56:28.479
Stop! Oh-oh-oh!

56:33.923 --> 56:36.153
<i>- Dang!
- I'll help you, Granny.</i>

56:36.259 --> 56:38.557
<i>Come on. Swim over here.</i>

56:38.661 --> 56:40.754
There we go. Give me your hand.

56:40.864 --> 56:43.628
Upsy-daisy.
Come on.

56:43.733 --> 56:46.065
<i>There we...
Ow.! Granny.!</i>

56:46.169 --> 56:48.797
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Granny!

56:48.905 --> 56:51.237
<i>Miss Arlington, you reckon if we got hitched,</i>

56:51.341 --> 56:54.139
you could help me tame
my daughter, Elly May?

56:54.244 --> 56:56.940
Are you proposing
we get married?

56:57.046 --> 57:00.914
Well, I wouldn't feel
right about breedin' if we didn't.

57:09.926 --> 57:14.829
Okay, men, that's it. Hit the mineral baths.

57:14.931 --> 57:17.263
<i>- Howdy.
- Well, well. Look who's here.</i>

57:17.367 --> 57:21.030
<i>- Missed you at practice, babe.
- She didn't come alone.</i>

57:21.137 --> 57:23.002
Hey, Morgan.
What are you doin' here?

57:26.075 --> 57:28.976
<i>- Well, who's all these folks?
- Just to keep things fair.</i>

57:29.078 --> 57:31.842
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Well, come on, baby.

57:31.948 --> 57:33.677
Let's wrestle.

57:36.252 --> 57:38.812
- Come on!
- Come on. Give it to him.

57:38.922 --> 57:41.891
<i>Oh, wait. That's mine.</i>

57:41.991 --> 57:44.152
It's mine.

57:46.196 --> 57:48.323
Come on, man.
You can do it!

57:48.431 --> 57:51.127
- Fight in the gym.
- All right. - Cool.

58:08.051 --> 58:10.918
<i>Wait. Hold on. I'm getting a fax.</i>

58:14.457 --> 58:17.255
Meet me there.

58:27.303 --> 58:29.771
This here's what I call
the Clampett clamp.

58:29.873 --> 58:31.602
That's not legal.

58:31.708 --> 58:34.074
Really?
Well, try this one.

58:35.612 --> 58:39.343
Hey, come on.

58:39.449 --> 58:42.179
- I call it the possum pretzel.
- That ain't legal either.

58:42.285 --> 58:45.516
- Well...
- Ow!

58:47.290 --> 58:49.383
What about
the hickory nut crunch?

58:54.330 --> 58:56.093
That's definitely not legal!

58:56.199 --> 58:59.828
Well, ain't nothin' legal 'round here?

59:08.244 --> 59:11.543
One, two...

59:13.750 --> 59:16.947
One, two...

59:17.053 --> 59:20.386
- Yeah!
- Three.

59:31.701 --> 59:34.568
Young lady!

59:34.671 --> 59:37.435
I think we've found
a new team captain.

59:37.540 --> 59:40.509
Sorry, Derek.
You're demoted.

59:42.011 --> 59:43.638
Come here, Morgan.

59:43.746 --> 59:46.340
Thanks, y'all.

59:53.423 --> 59:58.554
I truly appreciate y'all a-tossin' me
this here fancy birthday party.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:01.960
Everybody looks just as nice as peach pie.

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:05.466
I just got one
question for you...

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:08.093
- Who are these people?
- Well...

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:17.508
Howdy, Miss Jane.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.082
<i>Oh, my goodness, jethro.</i>

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:26.078
I took your advice...
made me a big fashy car.

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.386
It's very you.
Very, very macho.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:33.121
- Thank you.
- Well, shall we?

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.465
Is Pa here yet?

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:46.136
Elly May Clampett,
you look plumb elegant.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:50.178
Thanks, Pa. I feel kind of funny
gettin' all gussied up like this...

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:53.715
but Miss Laurette
says I'll get used to it.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:58.151
You've done a fine job in
turnin' Elly May into a lady.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.950
Thank you,
Monsieur Clampett.

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:04.823
She is a diamond in ze rough,
just like you.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:09.057
What's all this?

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:12.430
Sushi, calamari, caviar.

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.527
What? Speak American.

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:18.266
Listen, I was wondering if, um...

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:20.342
maybe sometime
we could go out.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:24.743
Not on a date or anything, but just maybe
to go get some burgers or something.

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:27.645
Take off that silly hat.

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:32.444
Then again, I would, uh...
understand if you didn't want to.

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:36.389
Sounds like fun.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.723
So, Jethro, once we find
your UncleJed a wife...

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:43.629
- Perhaps it'll be your turn to get hitched.
- Me? No.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.702
I'm gonna be
a Hollywood bachelor...

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.930
date all the hot young starlets.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:52.838
Well, let me remind you not to overlook
the charms of the slightly older woman...

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:57.379
who more than makes up with experience
what she may lack in other arenas.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.812
Okay, Miss Jane.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.146
No problem.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:06.711
<i>- Oh, please, let me.
- Tyler, clam it. It's showtime.</i>

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.931
Miss Laurette?
Why are you cryin'?

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.701
I- I have just spoken
with your father.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:24.102
And he says I would make
ze best wife for him.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:28.473
- He did?
- But as happy as I would make him...

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:34.016
<i>I am afraid that you will think I'm too young
and beautiful to be your mother.</i>

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:41.289
Who'd of thought it...
Miss Laurette and my pa? Hmm.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:46.183
Oh, where is he? Oh.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:50.933
So I can call you whenever I want?
You'll hotfoot it right over?

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:54.730
- Mm-hmm.
- Hot dog.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:57.305
Thank you.

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:04.677
I will miss Elly May so much
when you find yourself a wife.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:10.413
- And I will miss you too.
- I hadn't thought about you not bein' here.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.387
It's sure been a pleasure
to have you stay with us.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.184
Thank you.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.156
Jed?

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.388
Elly May said ze strangest thing
to me tonight.

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:23.226
She said she would love
for me to be her mother.

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:28.031
<i>I'm sure she'll get over the disappointment
in whomever you choose.</i>

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.908
I love Elly May
just like a daughter.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.204
Perhaps you should
speak with her.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.541
I'll do that.

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.215
Well.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.224
This here's a big night for you...

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:54.660
all dressed up and ladylike
at your first Beverly Hills social.

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:57.324
Your ma would be so proud.

01:03:57.433 --> 01:04:01.233
Thanks, Pa. Miss Laurette said
she was right proud too.

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:04.067
You like her, don't you?

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:07.802
Well, I like her just fine,
and I guess you like her too.

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.878
I certainly do.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:14.082
All I want is for you
to be happy, Elly May.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:17.744
I just want you
to be happy, Pa.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.482
Well, I reckon
there's no time like right now.

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:28.021
<i>- Happy birthday, jed.
- Happy birthday.</i>

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.772
Oh!

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:02.125
Well, I got a feeling you're
worth every dime of it too.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.394
Step up here. Let me take
a good look at you.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.629
Boy, you're looking good
on your birthday.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.536
I think we need a speech,
don't you? Speech.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:19.407
You know, I have more
than any one man deserves...

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:22.484
yet there is something
I'd like for my birthday.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:27.989
I'd like to ask the one who helped Elly May
become a lady to be my wife.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.521
Miss Laurette Voleur.

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:36.598
Oh, I am so surprised.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.425
<i>This is ze happiest day
of my life.</i>

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.706
Huh?

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:49.335
All right.
Congratulations.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.665
- You don't say.
- I do say!

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.863
Well, I'll be.
Who's he marrying?

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:53.840
Oh, some foozy
with a fancy accent.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.173
She seems sneaky to me.
I don't trust her.

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:58.405
Oh, Granny, you
don't trust anybody.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.880
Never mind about that.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:04.714
I'm invitin' you to the weddin'
and the cousins.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.450
But just from Jed's side,
not includin' the Kelloggs nor the Daggs.

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:12.618
Now, Granny, you're not gonna
get into your tonic...

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:15.219
and disappear like you did when Jed
married your daughter, are ya?

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:23.299
Jethrine, your UncleJed's
gettin' married.

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:28.603
I always cry at weddings.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.202
Oh, now, honey.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:34.111
I do.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.046
Well, you got both kinds
of chickens here, Jed.

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:44.126
- White and the brown.
- What you got there, son?

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:47.889
Oh, it's just a standard
prenuptial agreement.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:53.128
Miss Hathaway said for you not to tell
anyone that you signed it, not even her.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:58.434
Well, if Miss Hathaway says so,
I don't even have to read this. It must be fine.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:06.741
They'll be comin' from miles around
to get my expert doctorin'...

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.647
and I won't
turn a one away.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:13.381
I done took me the "hypocritter" oath
to help everybody.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.395
Kinda weak.

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:25.524
Probably good enough for city folk.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.602
<i>Tyler.!</i>

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.533
Did you get him
to sign the papers?

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.734
Oh, yeah.
He's a very trusting man.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.971
He thinks everyone's honest.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.537
That's a quality I admire in a man
I'm taking advantage of.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.778
Hey, uh, you're not
sleeping with him, are you?

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:48.755
Tyler, you know once I move in with a man,
I stop having sex with him.

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.826
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:56.488
<i>- Keep your mind on business. Now go.
- Hey, wait.</i>

01:08:56.599 --> 01:09:00.729
<i>- How about a little good-bye kiss?
- All right.</i>

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.666
I knowed it!
I knowed it!

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:07.707
I done catched you red-handed,
you two-timin' hussy!

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.301
<i>When I inform jed, the weddin'will be off!</i>

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:13.676
Let's get her.

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:16.580
Uh-oh. Oh.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.915
No! No! No!

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.594
<i>Shut up, you old hag.!</i>

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:32.154
We got just the place for you.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.167
Let me down!

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:42.276
I've already input the info
into the computer.

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:45.779
Soon as you say "I do"... bing!
I press "Enter. "

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:48.441
Boom! The money goes
via modem to Switzerland.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.884
Bing, bang, boom.
We're rich!

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.154
- Oh.
- Look at those legs.

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:59.227
I can't wait to get them
wrapped around me.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.853
Get her off of me!

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.592
- Get those legs off him!
- She's got crap on her boots!

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:11.431
She doesn't even think we're her grandchildren.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.202
And you say you fear
for your lives?

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:18.440
Yes. I'm afraid the poor old dear
tried to shoot us with a shotgun.

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.572
Are there any other
indications of dementia?

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:23.413
Last week, we caught her
trying to eat a raccoon.

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:26.488
- Really?
- She calls us kidnappers.

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.989
They are! They are!
The old buzzards are!

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.389
<i>- Wait, now.
- Grandma, please.</i>

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:34.257
Ow! She bit me again, honey!

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.627
Better check her for rabies.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.893
<i>- Get two orderlies in here stat!
- Poor old dear.</i>

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:45.665
<i>We can't take the heartbreak a minute longer.
We need to admit her someplace...</i>

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:49.574
where she can be kept in a straitjacket
away from sharp objects and pay phones.

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:52.977
<i>From what you've told me,
I'd say that your grandmother...</i>

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:58.714
is a perfect candidate
for, uh, electroshock therapy.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:07.288
And nobody... I repeat nobody... is allowed
into the Clampett estate without an invitation.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:10.331
<i>Sans invitation, non.</i>

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.265
<i>Miss jane, this fella's all mad at me
'cause I opened up...</i>

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:14.996
this box of wedding food...

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.595
but there ain't nothin' in there
but a bunch of snails.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:21.608
<i>I think the snails got up in there
and et all the food.</i>

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:25.346
No problem. Jethro,
we'll just buy some more.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.109
And, Henri, the snails go back
to the garden where they belong...

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:31.015
<i>s'il vous plâit.</i>

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.985
To your posts.

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:37.218
<i>Everything's going fine,
but I have one small question.</i>

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:42.059
Granny has not been available for her
fitting, and the wedding is tomorrow.

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:46.328
<i>Hmm. Come to think of it, I ain't seen
hide nor hair of Granny since yesterday.</i>

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:49.063
And you're not concerned?

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:53.540
No. She done the same thing
when I married Elly May's ma.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.543
Came pourin' in
about three days later...

01:11:56.645 --> 01:12:00.012
naked as a jaybird and
reeking of her medicine.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:03.243
Hmm.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:39.585
<i>Play it, George.!</i>

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.761
Whoo!

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.528
<i>Miss Hathaway, if the immediate family
isn't concerned enough...</i>

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.999
to file a missing persons report,
then there's nothing we can do.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.297
But, Captain Gallo,
I suspect foul play.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.340
I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:43.480
But if you're desperate,
you might try this guy.

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:48.784
He's expensive, but he's also the best
private investigator around.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:02.269
Oh, this case was pretty easy
to crack, Miss Hathaway.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:07.001
<i>I have met unsavory characters before,
but she takes the cake.</i>

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.841
Laurette Voleur,
a. k. a. Laura Jackson.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.745
<i>A.k. a. Lili Lebecque.</i>

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:18.843
<i>Married 12 times to any guy
with a little extra money to throw around.</i>

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.081
I should've known.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:26.059
<i>Voleur. French for "thief. "
Now what about Granny?</i>

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:31.064
The old lady is being forcibly held
at the Los Viejos Retirement Home...

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:35.068
<i>a disreputable establishment,
often cited for patient abuse.</i>

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:38.037
Be tough to break her out.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.042
What a calamity,
and the wedding is just hours away.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:50.411
Reverend, do you think Cousin Bill's gonna
be too busy to make it to the weddin'?

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.727
<i>Hillary, where did I put that invitation?</i>

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:05.163
<i>Flowers, come here. Quick.</i>

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:09.226
<i>They need tent stakes
in the backyard right now. Let's go.</i>

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:19.169
Hello. Clampett residence.
Mr. Drysdale?

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:22.944
- I have an urgent call for Mr. Drysdale.
- I'll take that.

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:26.452
He works for me.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:29.524
- Woody Tyler. Can I help you?
- Tyler, what are you doing there?

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:32.287
Um, I just dropped by
to see if I could be of help.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:35.124
Tell Mr. Drysdale
to stop the wedding.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:39.963
- Okay.
- Laurette is a phony who is after Mr. Clampett's money.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:42.400
Well, that's not good.

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:46.133
- Do it, Tyler, or your job is toast.
- I got it.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:53.146
- She's getting fat, Mom.
- Where is Hathaway?

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.079
She was supposed
to check in with me hours ago.

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:58.152
- Well, I don't know, dear.
- Mr. Drysdale.

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:00.949
- What do you want, Tyler?
- Miss Hathaway called.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.547
She said something had come up and to go
ahead and start the wedding without her.

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.287
- Well, what could have come up?
- I wish I knew.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.920
<i>My, what a lovely dog.</i>

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.226
Oh, thank you.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.801
Tyler, make yourself useful.
Go count the olives.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.802
Oh, yeah. Right away.

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:18.532
Oh, I hate that little worm.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.303
What could possibly be more important
than this to Miss Hathaway?

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.027
- Look at that. New nurse.
- Yeah.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:44.759
- Howdy, Mama!
- My baby! Oh! Why!

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:47.767
My goodness, Beverly Hills
has made you so sophisticated.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.770
Doesn't your twin brother
look handsome?

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.999
<i>- Hi, jethro.
- Give him a kiss, Jethrine.</i>

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:56.703
Howdy, Jethro.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.113
Oh, excuse me.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.361
- I reckon.
- Yep.

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.527
Young man...

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:22.229
I am here to see
Daisy Mae Moses.

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.828
Ah, then you must be here
for the rabies test.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:28.501
Yes. Rabies test.
Exactly right.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.703
Then you want Room 525.

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:35.041
Oh, nurse.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.448
Better be careful.
She's a wild one.

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:40.487
We had to give her
electroshock therapy.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:43.888
Thank you.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:58.370
<i>- Excuse me.
- No problem.</i>

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:05.243
My God.
Oh, Granny.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:11.714
<i>Your elixir.</i>

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:17.190
I will take you
out of here immediately.

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.192
Your hair is just
a bit disheveled.

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:22.730
Miss Jane?
Is that you?

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:25.891
- 'Tis I.
- Oh!

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:33.374
- Granny says she don't trust Miss Laurette.
- Oh.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:37.969
Take off that silly hat.

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.951
I heard she's so skinny, you couldn't
hit her with a handful of corn.

01:18:56.198 --> 01:19:00.999
<i>Look where they're parking the cars.
My God, how tacky.</i>

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.838
This place is turning into a zoo.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.070
I think she's tryin' to
take him for all he's got.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:10.769
Hmm.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.887
Hi there, handsome.

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:26.119
- You mind if I sit in this chair?
- This chair?

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.856
- I was kind of saving...
- Thank you.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:33.497
Lovely wedding, isn't it?

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.138
Go.

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:45.102
Oh. We've got to get back.

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:47.704
I called. I told them
to stop the wedding...

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.681
but that Tyler
is so incompetent.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:53.312
Tyler? Him and Laurette's the ones
that stuck me in this hellhole!

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.879
So, stabbed in the back
by one of our own.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:59.460
And she ain't no foreigner.

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:01.859
There they are.
Stop them.

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.990
Jethro, hold up.

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.580
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, there she is.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.813
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Oh, she looks beautiful.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:06.059
Oh, I've got the vapors.

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.881
My makeup.

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.918
Oh.

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:35.115
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in case of an emergency.

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:38.784
"Oxygen masks will fall from
the overhead compartment.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.330
<i>"Your seat cushion can be
used as a floatin'device.</i>

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.557
<i>- Thus sayeth the Lord. "
- Excuse me, Reverend.</i>

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:47.760
But I believe you're readin'
the airplane safety instructions.

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:50.929
May we skip this part?

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:54.634
Hathaway had better have
a good excuse for not being here.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.539
<i>Quick, Granny, hurry.!</i>

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can I see your invitations, please?

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:06.514
I'll handle this, Granny. Young man, have you
any idea with whom you're speaking?

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:10.079
I'd say one crazy lady
and another one with a bad wig.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.785
Every strand of
this here hair is mine!

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.885
- Ow!
- Oh... Oh, Granny, no, no, no!

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:17.590
No, Granny, no! No, Granny, no!
We'll find another way.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:21.658
"We are gathered here
to unite these two in holy matrimony. "

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.338
- Can we hurry things up, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:32.205
<i>Come on. Come on, baby.</i>

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:35.374
<i>"If any one of y'all has one good reason
these two shouldn't be hitched... "</i>

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.849
<i>and it darn tootin'
better be a good reason...</i>

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:41.286
"then speak now or forever
hold your peace. "

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:46.952
<i>- All right, then. "I now pronounce you... "
- Please. Please. Please.</i>

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:49.189
<i>"man and... "</i>

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.889
<i>What in tarnation is that?</i>

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:58.662
Charge!

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.401
Come on, Granny!

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.944
It is I, Jane Hathaway.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:40.344
Hathaway,
have you lost your mind?

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:44.282
She's an impostor. She's marrying
Mr. Clampett just to steal his money.

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:48.584
- That sidewinder Tyler helped her!
- I'm ruined!

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.453
Milburn! Milburn!

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.997
Tyler. Let's set up the computer
and push the button.

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:58.292
If I can't have their money,
nobody should.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.062
Quick!

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.602
Okay.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:06.003
<i>We'll send their billion bucks
bouncin'around so many banks...</i>

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:09.076
<i>- they'll never find it.
- It's all set.</i>

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:12.977
All we got to do is push that button.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.549
You rustic, nose-picking,
inbred yokels!

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:19.984
- You're all about to be poor again.
- Think again.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:37.027
<i>No, you don't,
you schemin'skunk.!</i>

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.163
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:42.641
Oh, Pa, you must be
so disappointed.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.871
A little.

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:47.504
But, Elly May, I was mainly
marryin' Miss Laurette...

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:50.243
'cause I thought you wanted her
for your new ma.

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:55.654
- I'm so sorry, Pa.
- Don't be sorry.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.952
<i>I love you
just the way you are.</i>

01:24:58.059 --> 01:25:00.755
<i>I reckon I oughta raise you up
to be who you want to be.</i>

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:05.196
Well, I don't need a new ma,
not as long as I got you and Granny.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:10.664
Hot dog, Miss Jane!
You sure are a good shot.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.899
Well, thank you, Jethro.

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:13.996
- Whoo!
- Got ya!

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:17.237
Well, folks,
I guess you can say...

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:20.007
things didn't turn out
quite the way we planned.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:24.518
So, since there ain't
gonna be no hitchin'...

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.951
and we're all here anyway...

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:33.519
I say we have
one hellacious shindig.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:35.823
<i>Yeah.!</i>

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:46.233
<i>- Let go of me.!
- Here, boys. She's all yours!</i>

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:55.481
Let go of my hand!

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:14.367
- Hey! Nobody treats my pa that way!
- Shut up!

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:23.035
How's that for ladylike,
you old money-grubber?

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.444
Come on, city boy,
let's dance.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.953
All right, stand back!

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:41.455
You're under arrest
for kidnapping...

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:43.463
attempted embezzlement
and fraud.

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:46.864
<i>Oh, right.!
It was all Tyler's idea.</i>

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:56.409
I admit it freely.
It was all her idea.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:27:01.210
I always fall in love
with the wrong kind of man.

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.080
<i>- Clean up that cake.
- Don't step on the train.</i>

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:08.144
I'll wait for you, honey.

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:15.154
<i>Well, where was she? She... Oh.!</i>

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:19.097
- Oh, well...
- Whee doggie!

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:36.482
<i>Whoo.! Yeah.! That's good.</i>

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:51.858
Thank you.

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:55.834
That's just about right.
Oops!

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.963
It's a shame they had to
file for bankruptcy.

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:01.701
I just hope my call to
the I.R.S. didn't have...

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.505
- Oh, I shouldn't open it. Sorry.
- No problem. We'll do it again.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.170
<i>But I got there...</i>

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.079
That old lady is, uh...

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:11.811
That old lady is...
I'm sorry.

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:14.353
- That's okay.
- She's gettin' pretty old by now, I'll tell ya.

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.480
<i>Still rolling.</i>

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:21.650
<i>- Okay. Give me a big smile.
- I can't get any bigger.</i>

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.732
<i>So, uh, what happened?</i>

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:32.328
Actually, he slapped me.

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:42.074
Why don't you come up here?
Let me take a good look at you.

01:28:43.918 --> 01:28:47.149
<i>Jim. Jim? They're gettin'worried about you.</i>

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:55.217
- Not even a bridesmaid.
- I gotta do this again.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.567
<i>Action.!</i>

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:13.105
We've got... No,
we've got to get back.

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.842
I called, I told them
to postpone the...

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.850
- I lost my purse.
- It's right here.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:21.251
- How did you get it?
- I don't know.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.723
Jethro?
Come on down here.

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.090
Likely as not, there's
another family lives up here...

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.958
there.
