02:09.644 --> 02:12.063
Come in.

02:19.571 --> 02:22.891
Johnson, you're different
from the other coloureds in here.

02:22.991 --> 02:26.286
You read books, play chess, write poetry.

02:28.121 --> 02:34.168
But I don't believe you have any regret
whatsoever for taking a man's life.

02:35.753 --> 02:41.592
A man who recognises his mistakes
is ready to seek God's forgiveness.

02:41.718 --> 02:45.288
Yeah, I've read your Bible, Warden.

02:45.388 --> 02:48.099
And?

02:51.519 --> 02:54.731
It's a good book.

03:31.309 --> 03:33.811
I need to feed my babies.

04:16.813 --> 04:19.482
Let the men pass, son.

04:20.358 --> 04:24.111
No man knoweth the moment nor the hour.

04:28.074 --> 04:30.201
Good day to you, sir.

04:31.953 --> 04:36.524
I'll be damned! Bumpy Johnson!
They let your ass out, huh?

04:36.624 --> 04:40.127
- How's business, Willie?
- People outta work play the numbers.

04:44.215 --> 04:47.134
Batter up! This one's for you, Babe Ruth!

04:48.261 --> 04:50.621
You gonna pay for that, Bub!

04:50.721 --> 04:53.683
Where's the slips? Where's the slips?

04:56.310 --> 05:00.898
- Call off your dogs, Bub!
- What did I tell you

05:01.357 --> 05:04.677
about running numbers out of this place?

05:04.777 --> 05:08.322
I was just trying to make a living
just like you, motherfucker!

05:11.909 --> 05:17.039
You mess with Dutch Schultz,
you messin' with me!

05:20.293 --> 05:27.008
You don't write a goddamn thing in Harlem!

05:28.968 --> 05:31.621
Do you understand that now?

05:31.721 --> 05:34.056
Yes.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.768
It's a new day!

05:37.977 --> 05:40.796
Dutch Schultz

05:40.896 --> 05:43.466
writes policy

05:43.566 --> 05:45.318
in Harlem!

05:55.119 --> 05:58.247
- Keep the motor running, Cecil.
- Yes, sir.

05:58.998 --> 06:00.775
Ladies.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.777
Very nice.

06:02.877 --> 06:04.862
- Mr Luciano.
- Hello, Bo.

06:04.962 --> 06:08.115
Franco, take Bambi for a walk.
OK? I'll be right out.

06:08.215 --> 06:10.576
Watch out for all the broken glass here.

06:10.676 --> 06:13.387
- Hey, Bobby.
- Mr Luciano.

06:16.307 --> 06:18.584
Stand up for Mr Luciano!

06:18.684 --> 06:22.063
Please, sit. Sit down, please. Thank you.

06:24.190 --> 06:26.884
- Things are progressing here.
- Rapidly.

06:26.984 --> 06:29.762
So you guys are doing OK?

06:29.862 --> 06:32.223
We make a mint.

06:32.323 --> 06:34.433
Well, well! Cecil.

06:34.533 --> 06:37.828
- How long it been?
- Damn near since the Ebony Earl days.

06:38.162 --> 06:41.232
- Why the hell are you chauffeuring?
- Paying the bills.

06:41.332 --> 06:44.668
My old lady made me put down the gun.

06:45.252 --> 06:47.129
- Regards to Helen.
- You got it.

06:49.381 --> 06:53.552
You won't have major trouble
with Madam Queen's people.

06:54.512 --> 06:55.955
Here.

06:56.055 --> 06:58.624
Yeah, well, she's the last holdout.

06:58.724 --> 07:02.812
- She bends to the stick, Harlem's ours.
- Hello, Dutch.

07:03.979 --> 07:06.048
Well, well! Lucky.

07:06.148 --> 07:09.135
- You're slumming today.
- Thought I'd stop by.

07:09.235 --> 07:12.763
You know, for your portion
of the Dewey payment.

07:12.863 --> 07:17.268
Special fuckin' prosecutor. Trying to
put my ass in jail for tax evasion.

07:17.368 --> 07:19.812
I still gotta make a fucking payoff!

07:19.912 --> 07:24.066
Wanna keep our shirt collars clean,
we gotta have Dewey in our pocket.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.819
I ain't seen him
touching your fucking business.

07:26.919 --> 07:28.738
That's because I show him respect.

07:28.838 --> 07:32.199
You're so busy with Harlem pennies,
you forget the big picture.

07:32.299 --> 07:36.637
Yeah, well,
nigger pennies... white pennies.

07:37.638 --> 07:41.433
They all add up to the same fucking thing:
my fucking dollars.

07:41.642 --> 07:45.463
Well, that's why I'm here. Ante up.

07:45.563 --> 07:47.857
Lulu, get the cash.

07:50.693 --> 07:55.848
When you give Dewey 2,000 of my
hard-earned dollars, tell him one thing.

07:55.948 --> 07:59.535
If he don't back off,
I'll kill him myself.

07:59.785 --> 08:01.912
Here, Dutch.

08:12.965 --> 08:16.635
- You got mustard on your suit.
- I'm breaking it in for a friend.

08:23.726 --> 08:28.088
Answer me this. Why would that
droopy-eyed, lowlife, greaseball pimp

08:28.188 --> 08:31.425
come all the way up to Harlem
when he could send a stooge?

08:31.525 --> 08:34.820
- I don't know.
- It's rhetorical.

08:38.157 --> 08:41.559
Illinois, come on, baby.
Pay me some nevermind.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.729
Put them number slips away!

08:43.828 --> 08:47.650
Number slips is how I make my money.
You're confusing me, Pigfoot.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.861
I'm three slips short.
The Queen already don't like me.

08:50.961 --> 08:53.672
Would you just let a man
accomplish his business?

08:53.839 --> 08:57.509
I'm your business now.
You need to accomplish this.

09:00.095 --> 09:02.164
- Pigfoot.
- Huh?

09:02.264 --> 09:05.834
- What time do I have to turn in my slips?
- One o'clock.

09:05.934 --> 09:08.420
And what time do people check the paper

09:08.520 --> 09:11.465
to get the day's numbers
off them stock exchange totals?

09:11.565 --> 09:15.010
I'm not a goddamn idiot.
I know how to play the numbers.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.363
You need to be...

09:20.199 --> 09:22.643
- Is that your husband?
- How do I know?

09:22.743 --> 09:26.272
I know nothing about that two-timing,
gator-faced grape-cat!

09:26.372 --> 09:28.649
- Don't shoot him!
- I'm gonna fix his ass.

09:28.749 --> 09:31.443
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him?

09:31.543 --> 09:34.713
If you don't get your ass
in that closet...!

09:45.933 --> 09:48.894
Bumpy Johnson.

09:49.895 --> 09:51.755
What's buzzin', cousin?

09:51.855 --> 09:56.635
Don't you put your hand out there for me!
Come over here and hug my neck.

09:56.735 --> 09:59.430
- Oh, my goodness!
- Been a long time, huh?

09:59.530 --> 10:02.433
- Oh, man! Come here, man.
- Good to see you.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.853
Mary! Mary, come on out.
You remember my cousin Bumpy.

10:05.953 --> 10:09.481
Bumpy Johnson!
Oh, boy, you're a sight for sore eyes!

10:09.581 --> 10:13.777
Good to see you.
I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

10:13.877 --> 10:16.989
Baby, you and me gonna
have to lay dead for a little while.

10:17.089 --> 10:19.783
- I gotta tend to my man's wellbeing.
- Dead?

10:19.883 --> 10:21.952
Oh, you putting me out!

10:22.052 --> 10:25.914
Let me get my shoes. Be a long time
before you get your hambone boiled!

10:26.014 --> 10:28.083
And you stay from up in my face!

10:28.183 --> 10:30.686
Good to see you, Pigfoot.

10:34.398 --> 10:36.467
You think you're sharp!

10:36.567 --> 10:39.887
What you doin' knocking
like you the damn police or worse?

10:39.987 --> 10:42.264
Don't be ignorant your whole life.

10:42.364 --> 10:45.659
- Oh, Bumpy Johnson.
- Illinois Gordon.

10:46.451 --> 10:48.979
- How's business?
- Dutch Schultz is at it again.

10:49.079 --> 10:53.066
He been gattin' folks all over town.
Even messing with the Queen.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.544
The Queen?

10:56.712 --> 10:59.823
- The Queen don't bow to no man.
- She ain't bowed yet, but...

10:59.923 --> 11:01.992
We can talk about that another time.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.620
I see you still
with the large-sized ladies.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.665
Now, hold on there, cousin.
Like I always tell you,

11:08.765 --> 11:13.545
there ain't nothing like the loving
you get from a big woman.

11:13.645 --> 11:16.231
Mm-hm. Same old Bear!

11:28.118 --> 11:30.270
He thinks I'm gonna roll over, ¡está loco!

11:30.370 --> 11:33.498
Take it easy, Henry.
Dutch just wanna talk.

11:38.879 --> 11:43.200
Seem like everybody in Harlem
played 505 and the goddamn number hits.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.744
I needed 18 grand to pay off the players.

11:45.844 --> 11:50.582
That's why I came to you. Now my
runners say your boys are playing rough!

11:50.682 --> 11:54.311
Sit down, Henry.
I'm getting a fucking neck ache.

11:56.396 --> 12:00.968
There's your money. Plus two in interest
on the loan, like we agreed.

12:01.068 --> 12:04.680
I don't consider that a fucking loan, Henry.
That was an investment.

12:04.780 --> 12:08.934
I believe that investment entitles me
to a piece of the fucking bank.

12:09.034 --> 12:12.646
- We're partners, Henry.
- ¡Mira, no me vengas con eso!

12:12.746 --> 12:14.398
- In English.
- No, no!

12:14.498 --> 12:17.651
I know you since you sold shit-piss
needle beer in the Bronx!

12:17.751 --> 12:21.989
And you're still the same.
¡P'al carajo, hijo de puta, cabrón, tacaño!

12:22.089 --> 12:24.658
- Henry...
- You might've pulled this shit

12:24.758 --> 12:28.662
con el motherfucking negro como
Willie Brunder and Big Joe Ison.

12:28.762 --> 12:30.831
That's cos those bankers got no balls.

12:30.931 --> 12:34.393
I got balls as big as you.
¡Las bolas más grandes!

12:43.443 --> 12:46.530
Big balls. No brains.

13:09.344 --> 13:11.830
Jesus!

13:11.930 --> 13:15.000
- I don't feel comfortable here.
- Relax.

13:15.100 --> 13:19.629
The mayor won't be happy to know his
special prosecutor's having a meeting

13:19.729 --> 13:21.590
in Mr Luciano's milieu.

13:21.690 --> 13:26.053
Why don't you ask him?
He's on the second floor right now.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.889
This month's contributions.

13:28.989 --> 13:31.283
Fine.

13:32.826 --> 13:35.812
- We have a problem.
- The valise is not big enough?

13:35.912 --> 13:39.232
I'm talking about Arthur Flegenheimer.

13:39.332 --> 13:44.087
You know why Arthur chose the name
Dutch Schultz? He wants respect.

13:44.379 --> 13:48.533
Who's gonna respect a man
by the name of Arthur Flegenheimer?

13:48.633 --> 13:52.746
''All right, boys. Stick 'em up!
My name is Arthur Flegenheimer.''

13:52.846 --> 13:56.291
- It won't work, Mr Dewey.
- He's threatening to kill me.

13:56.391 --> 14:00.462
It's nonsense. He's bent outta shape
because of your tax-evasion charges.

14:00.562 --> 14:03.173
He'd rather lose a testicle
than pay the government.

14:03.273 --> 14:07.552
- So what do you propose?
- I propose you take it easy.

14:07.652 --> 14:10.972
Think about your future, not our demise.

14:11.072 --> 14:16.102
In the meantime, enjoy the scenery.
Have a long drink with one of the girls.

14:16.202 --> 14:19.940
Listen to me... very carefully.
I don't wanna have to say this again.

14:20.040 --> 14:24.127
I am not your friend. I don't want
the services of your whores.

14:24.419 --> 14:29.366
We are in a business arrangement
for obvious mutual benefits.

14:29.466 --> 14:32.661
Mr Schultz threatens this arrangement.

14:32.761 --> 14:35.680
- Have I made myself clear?
- Crystal.

14:44.189 --> 14:46.274
It's clear you took the money.

14:47.025 --> 14:50.011
I ain't seen this many poor folks
in Harlem in all my life.

14:50.111 --> 14:52.681
Well, cousin, welcome to the Depression.

14:52.781 --> 14:56.409
Only way a cat can make a dime
these days is running numbers.

15:07.879 --> 15:09.990
Hey, toots, I see you!

15:10.090 --> 15:12.175
You can't keep ducking me.

15:13.718 --> 15:15.804
All right.

15:29.818 --> 15:32.637
- My boy is back.
- Whispers.

15:32.737 --> 15:37.100
You ain't never had no loot,
but you still my favourite boot.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.786
It does feel good to see you, Bump.

15:40.495 --> 15:42.564
You're late, Illinois.

15:42.664 --> 15:44.749
The Queen is mad.

15:46.334 --> 15:49.487
Surprise!

15:49.587 --> 15:52.674
Did somebody say something
about sprucing somebody?

15:55.427 --> 15:57.704
This is the new guy... Vallie.

15:57.804 --> 16:00.206
- Mr Johnson.
- Nice to meet you.

16:00.306 --> 16:05.295
Come on, come on. Madam Queen
is waiting, been waiting.

16:05.395 --> 16:07.939
There she is.

16:10.316 --> 16:13.778
- Hello, Madam Queen.
- Bumpy Johnson.

16:20.034 --> 16:23.104
You still have the light in your eyes, eh?

16:23.204 --> 16:25.290
Praise God.

16:29.085 --> 16:34.282
Before we get this soiree started,
I need to speak with you for a few ticks.

16:34.382 --> 16:35.492
All right.

16:35.592 --> 16:38.136
Y'all enjoy yourself, hear?

16:40.847 --> 16:42.916
Illinois said that Dutch Schultz

16:43.016 --> 16:46.978
put six of your men on the slab
in Harlem Hospital.

16:48.021 --> 16:50.090
Oui.

16:50.190 --> 16:55.804
Mr Schultz is trying to make trouble,
but I set up a meeting next week,

16:55.904 --> 16:58.615
and it is then
I will make my position clear.

16:58.907 --> 17:02.852
I wanna go with you to that meeting
as your bodyguard.

17:02.952 --> 17:07.816
You think you're gonna protect her,
lamb's breath? That for me job!

17:07.915 --> 17:11.294
- Me take care of Queen!
- I have faith in Tee.

17:11.461 --> 17:17.467
I know Tee-Ninchy got spine, but faith
ain't gonna get rid of the Dutchman.

17:18.259 --> 17:21.371
I saw what his boys did to Willie Brunder.

17:21.471 --> 17:24.874
I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing
and let that happen to you.

17:24.973 --> 17:30.547
He's threatening to take over business
that's taken you ten years to build up.

17:30.647 --> 17:35.318
I want everybody to know
the Queen's still carrying power uptown.

17:38.112 --> 17:41.699
- Please?
- I still can't say no to you, eh?

17:46.079 --> 17:50.024
I had a dream... a big ol' crawfish
jumped off a plate and bit me.

17:50.124 --> 17:52.485
What Madam Zora's dream book say for fish?

17:52.585 --> 17:56.114
579. But I wouldn't bother with no 579.

17:56.214 --> 18:00.326
That stock exchange figure they used
for the numbers was 579 last week!

18:00.426 --> 18:02.704
It ain't gonna be 579 again.

18:02.804 --> 18:05.290
There was sweet potato pie
on the plate, too.

18:05.390 --> 18:09.252
Potatoes is under ''potatoes''.
Oh, look, here it is.

18:09.352 --> 18:15.650
642. Huh! 642? Uh-uh.
I ain't gonna play no 642. It give me gas.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.680
Potatoes give me gas.
I ain't playing no number that give me gas!

18:20.780 --> 18:23.725
I bet your gas smell as sweet
as flowers in springtime!

18:23.825 --> 18:27.770
Mm-mm. Don't you be trying
to get in my good graces.

18:27.870 --> 18:31.249
- Hey, Miss Mary.
- Shh. Damn, woman, you hard as lard!

18:31.916 --> 18:35.028
You know what? I hate crawfish.

18:35.128 --> 18:38.114
I'm gonna just go ahead
and play a dime on 642 straight.

18:38.214 --> 18:43.244
- That's another dime down the drain.
- Lord have mercy! Garveyite Francine.

18:43.344 --> 18:46.789
This is for you and the kids.
Save your money, Sul.

18:46.889 --> 18:49.459
Hey, you don't need
to be telling her that,

18:49.559 --> 18:52.295
or I'll beat you
till you smell like onions.

18:52.395 --> 18:55.214
I'll drag you by that collar
and drop you in the gutter.

18:55.314 --> 18:57.400
Yeah, yeah. Let me see that.

18:57.942 --> 19:01.804
Now, look at this! What you doin',
peddling this gold-can jive?

19:01.904 --> 19:05.308
You can bake it, broil it,
fry it, hang it out to dry,

19:05.408 --> 19:08.353
it's still just as funky
as a fat man's drawers!

19:08.453 --> 19:12.523
Don't you see people hungry? What do
you do for people, numbers man?

19:12.623 --> 19:15.860
I have told you several times,
I'm the poor man's racetrack.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.988
You take the money
needed to put food on the table.

19:19.088 --> 19:22.992
A million-to-one odds... it's a scam!
It's gambling, that's what it is.

19:23.092 --> 19:24.802
Excuse me.

19:25.094 --> 19:29.165
The numbers provide jobs for
2,000 coloured folks in Harlem alone.

19:29.265 --> 19:31.501
A penny gets you $6... a month's groceries.

19:31.601 --> 19:34.921
A month's worth of people food,
not this bullshit!

19:35.021 --> 19:37.423
It's the only home-grown business we got.

19:37.523 --> 19:39.484
- Are you his partner?
- Don't worry about it.

19:39.609 --> 19:42.445
Y'all make a better team
than Amos 'n' Andy!

19:42.945 --> 19:47.992
I don't need no partner.
My name is Bumpy Johnson.

19:48.784 --> 19:51.913
Bumpy? Your momma named you Bumpy?

19:54.248 --> 19:57.235
What you gonna do
with that hair in Africa?

19:57.335 --> 20:00.321
They ain't got no straightening
combs over there! Ugly!

20:00.421 --> 20:02.698
- She fine as frog legs!
- OK, cousin,

20:02.798 --> 20:07.078
- tell me about Miss Francine Hughes.
- Oh, Francine!

20:07.178 --> 20:12.041
She always quoting Marcus Garvey
about moving back to hot-ass Africa.

20:12.141 --> 20:15.795
I think she work down at
that United Negro something-or-other.

20:15.895 --> 20:19.132
- Improvement Association?
- That's it.

20:19.232 --> 20:21.300
Man, she sure is high-toned!

20:21.400 --> 20:25.138
You see the glimmers on that girl?
Where do you think she got them eyes?

20:25.238 --> 20:28.766
Francine Hughes is not gonna
take up with the likes of you.

20:28.866 --> 20:31.894
She high-powered
and she got her boots laced,

20:31.994 --> 20:34.105
so don't even pay that no nevermind.

20:34.205 --> 20:36.482
All I wanna do is converse with her.

20:36.582 --> 20:40.044
Yeah, I bet you gonna have
a long-ass conversation!

20:41.337 --> 20:46.550
Son, the man that walks with Francine
will walk down the Christian path!

20:48.135 --> 20:53.791
Hey! Damn! All these roaches in here!
It's like stepping on cornflakes.

20:53.891 --> 20:56.627
At least you won't be sleeping alone.

20:56.727 --> 21:01.565
Hey, Bumpy, you know, these last
couple of years here with you gone,

21:02.566 --> 21:05.261
well, I just wanna say
I really missed you.

21:05.361 --> 21:09.223
- I missed you, too.
- I got you a little present.

21:09.323 --> 21:13.703
Now, it's not new.
I got it from old Clarence up on St Nick.

21:14.787 --> 21:17.064
Hello there, Mr Speaker!

21:17.164 --> 21:21.919
Yeah, I figure you might need that
to open a few doors for yourself.

21:23.129 --> 21:24.839
Yeah.

21:27.967 --> 21:31.512
That's hard-hitting. Thanks, cousin.

21:38.853 --> 21:42.898
Together we got strength,
we got experience.

21:44.358 --> 21:49.305
Most of all, though, we got organisation.
A partnership's gonna increase the profits.

21:49.405 --> 21:55.077
Si, certainement. There will be no profit
with your boys collecting the money.

21:55.703 --> 22:00.066
What I got? I got fuckin' horns
growing outta my head here?

22:00.166 --> 22:02.501
I don't feel nothin'.

22:03.586 --> 22:06.030
Madam Stephanie,
I'm not the fucking devil.

22:06.130 --> 22:10.301
But you do the devil's work.
Six of me men is proof of that.

22:10.426 --> 22:14.747
But if I hadn't sent an invitation,
you wouldn't have met me, would you?

22:14.847 --> 22:19.835
Come on, Queen. From what I hear,
you ain't exactly a fuckin' nun yourself.

22:19.935 --> 22:25.591
Mr Schultz, me not here to quarrel
about your right to own your own bank,

22:25.691 --> 22:29.428
but I ask to respect my right
to have me own.

22:29.528 --> 22:31.806
Comprenez-vous?

22:31.906 --> 22:35.017
- Oh, yeah, I fuckin' vous.
- Bon.

22:35.117 --> 22:40.523
You know, that reminds me of this
thing that spic Henry Miro said.

22:40.623 --> 22:43.317
He said he had the balls
to stand up to me.

22:43.417 --> 22:47.321
''Las bolas más grandes.''
That's what he fuckin' said.

22:47.421 --> 22:49.798
You know something?

22:50.966 --> 22:53.285
He really does have big fuckin' balls!

22:53.385 --> 22:56.055
Blasphemer! Ya bastard!

22:58.390 --> 23:01.727
You gonna shoot me this time, Bub?

23:02.061 --> 23:06.815
If so, you might wanna lower that
a little bit, hit me in the heart.

23:07.107 --> 23:10.236
This way you don't make a mess.

23:14.406 --> 23:18.994
So, Dutch, you wanna do this peaceful
or you wanna make a go?

23:30.673 --> 23:33.467
Boys, boys.

23:34.635 --> 23:37.554
Lower the fuckin' metal.

23:39.306 --> 23:42.017
Put 'em down.

23:42.643 --> 23:45.754
Tee-Ninchy, now ain't the time.
Put the shotgun down.

23:45.854 --> 23:49.717
Man crazy! Man real crazy!

23:49.817 --> 23:53.153
Think he can drop dead man's balls
upon me Queen!

23:54.280 --> 23:57.600
You forget one thing, Tee.

23:57.700 --> 24:01.036
Me no got no balls to lose.

24:02.997 --> 24:07.459
We ain't gonna crease...
like Brunder, or Miro.

24:12.423 --> 24:15.592
Some you win, some you fuckin' lose!

24:16.677 --> 24:18.746
- We got a problem.
- She's gonna fold.

24:18.846 --> 24:21.348
I ain't talking about her.

24:23.058 --> 24:25.561
He's not gonna go away.

24:32.568 --> 24:37.348
You don't have to have a hanker
to be a broker or a banker

24:37.448 --> 24:41.618
No, siree, just if you'll be
my mother's son-in-law

24:42.411 --> 24:46.982
Needn't even think of tryin'
to be a mighty social lion

24:47.082 --> 24:50.110
Sippin' tea if you'll be
my mother's son-in-law

24:50.210 --> 24:54.256
Look at all these fine women!
They must be having recess in heaven.

24:54.882 --> 24:57.201
..to set the world on fire

24:57.301 --> 24:59.787
Just wish you'd make it proper...

24:59.887 --> 25:02.181
Ain't nobody here.

25:04.224 --> 25:06.293
Uh-oh. Don't look now,

25:06.393 --> 25:09.772
but here's your chance
to have your long-ass conversation.

25:14.568 --> 25:16.762
Oh, look who came with Illinois.

25:16.862 --> 25:21.392
- Francine's new friend Bumpy.
- He's not my friend.

25:21.492 --> 25:24.937
All the women in the neighbourhood
have eyes for him.

25:25.037 --> 25:27.748
Ooh, honey, he's a killer-diller!

25:28.165 --> 25:33.045
- He is not my type.
- You can't judge a book with just a look.

25:37.633 --> 25:41.245
Miss Mary, what say you
do me the honour of

25:41.345 --> 25:44.164
joining me out there on the dance floor?

25:44.264 --> 25:48.127
Today's your lucky day, boy.
Sulie wanna dance, too.

25:48.227 --> 25:50.754
Hell, no, I don't wanna dance!
My feet hurt.

25:50.854 --> 25:52.940
Yes, you do.

25:54.858 --> 26:00.364
Oh, yeah. Who wouldn't wanna
dance with ol' Illinois?

26:16.713 --> 26:18.574
Mind if I sit?

26:18.674 --> 26:22.828
I heard about you,
Mr Ellsworth ''Bumpy'' Johnson.

26:22.928 --> 26:25.747
Fresh out of Sing Sing
and back on the streets.

26:25.847 --> 26:28.500
Yeah,

26:28.600 --> 26:31.295
I got a reputation.

26:31.395 --> 26:34.481
But I like you, and I think
you like me, so

26:36.608 --> 26:38.735
let's dance.

26:38.902 --> 26:45.350
In my solitude

26:45.450 --> 26:52.958
You haunt me

26:54.042 --> 26:59.239
With memories

26:59.339 --> 27:03.510
Of days gone by

27:09.349 --> 27:11.418
- There you are.
- Oh, my God!

27:11.518 --> 27:15.047
Thanks. Thanks for walking me home.

27:15.147 --> 27:17.232
My pleasure.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.779
I have one question. Why you gotta
involve yourself in numbers?

27:23.113 --> 27:25.724
I mean, what would you have me do?

27:25.824 --> 27:29.228
Shine shoes? Carry bags
down at Grand Central?

27:29.328 --> 27:32.998
I'm a coloured man. White folks ain't
left me nothing but the underworld.

27:33.206 --> 27:37.861
Well, I disagree. There are coloured
doctors, lawyers, accountants,...

27:37.961 --> 27:40.239
- True.
- ..writers, musicians.

27:40.339 --> 27:45.260
- You could do any one of those.
- I do write a little poetry.

27:46.094 --> 27:48.597
You write a little poetry?

27:50.140 --> 27:56.463
I ask myself where she got those eyes
So full of light, so free of lies.

27:56.563 --> 27:59.883
How does one get eyes like that?

27:59.983 --> 28:03.487
I tell myself she robbed a cat.

28:04.738 --> 28:07.491
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.

28:09.117 --> 28:11.286
Well, when can I see you again?

28:11.578 --> 28:15.957
Well, keep writing those poems,
Ellsworth, and we'll see.

28:18.335 --> 28:20.754
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

29:09.511 --> 29:12.164
- Blow on my dice for me.
- Move yourself, boy!

29:12.264 --> 29:16.126
I'm tryin' to make some money.
I need that cool West Indian breeze.

29:16.226 --> 29:20.397
Come on now, blow on it. Cool, cool
number. Look at him smiling now!

29:21.773 --> 29:24.693
He blew on them bones, didn't he?

29:26.611 --> 29:31.408
- I'm gonna break the bank now!
- Here we go. Here we go.

29:34.744 --> 29:37.314
What you doin' pitchin' dice on me stoop?

29:37.414 --> 29:40.125
- Go away from here!
- Yes, ma'am.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.404
Bumpy, come help an old lady
down the steps.

29:44.504 --> 29:46.548
Yes, Madam.

29:48.216 --> 29:53.747
Madam Queen! Looking just as fine
as one of them African violets.

29:53.847 --> 29:57.250
Move from me! Me don't need
to have me bottom kissed.

29:57.350 --> 30:00.045
Mikey, June, Whispers, trail our car.

30:00.145 --> 30:04.316
Hey! Hey, Bumpy! Boy,
I sure wish I was going to the opera.

30:05.191 --> 30:07.302
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Tee-Ninchy!

30:07.402 --> 30:11.531
Hey, why you goin' to the opera
and you can't even understan' English?

30:12.282 --> 30:14.451
You gotta gimme five! Gimme ten!

30:14.743 --> 30:19.289
Gimme 20! I would give you 30
but your hand's too dirty!

30:41.186 --> 30:43.255
What is this now?

30:43.355 --> 30:46.216
I don't know why you make me
come to these things.

30:46.316 --> 30:48.385
To culture you, Bumpy.

30:48.485 --> 30:53.056
You know, I have not missed an opera
on me birthday in 16 years.

30:53.156 --> 30:55.850
You need to give Tee-Ninchy some culture.

30:55.950 --> 30:59.896
- How about me rattle your head?
- You'll love Verdi's Macbeth.

30:59.996 --> 31:02.691
It's in Italian.
I don't understand Italian.

31:02.791 --> 31:07.712
It deals with life,
war and, most of all, passion.

31:10.215 --> 31:13.843
Mon Dieu! We gonna miss the overture!

31:15.678 --> 31:17.472
Get down!

32:22.120 --> 32:24.622
Move back! Move back!

32:46.352 --> 32:48.855
Bumpy! Mercy!

33:02.452 --> 33:06.856
Quel cauchemar! Mon protecteur!

33:06.956 --> 33:11.611
Amour! Mon ami amour!

33:11.711 --> 33:13.988
Mon Dieu!

33:14.088 --> 33:20.036
Sang partout! Sang partout!
Le sang partout!

33:20.136 --> 33:23.222
Mon amour! Sang partout!

34:58.151 --> 35:01.429
I can contain it because
only the negro papers have it.

35:01.529 --> 35:04.599
But if Winchell gets a hold of this,
he'll have a field day.

35:04.699 --> 35:10.246
- He just wants to sell newspapers.
- He will, at everyone's expense.

35:15.710 --> 35:20.907
Look, Charles, even by your standards,
this is a psychopath.

35:21.007 --> 35:24.927
How much longer am I going to
be worried about Arthur Flegenheimer?

35:25.428 --> 35:30.833
You gotta learn to relax, Thomas.
I'll take care of the Dutchman.

35:30.933 --> 35:34.128
Meantime, why don't you come up here
and join us by the pool?

35:34.228 --> 35:36.147
Loosen up that stiff neck of yours.

35:42.737 --> 35:45.031
Thank you, Alice.

35:50.286 --> 35:53.397
So what's the skinny, Johnny?

35:53.497 --> 35:55.775
You were right, Mr Luciano.

35:55.875 --> 36:00.696
My figures show the numbers
at 100,000 a day before payouts.

36:00.796 --> 36:03.507
Harlem is a g-g-g...

36:05.343 --> 36:08.012
goldmine.

36:11.682 --> 36:15.311
What's the matter?
You wanna go swimming there, Johnny?

36:16.812 --> 36:18.648
No, I-I never learned how.

36:31.327 --> 36:35.456
- Where's Hector?
- Went out to get some rice and beans.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.943
- When's he coming back?
- I don't know, boss.

36:39.043 --> 36:43.673
But if you're here to collect policy money,
don't worry. It's all under control.

36:44.006 --> 36:47.677
- Everything copacetic, cousin?
- Oh, yeah.

36:51.472 --> 36:54.058
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

36:56.477 --> 36:59.730
- Now you know!
- I'm the bagman.

37:07.446 --> 37:09.532
Let's go, Bear.

37:16.497 --> 37:20.735
So, cousin, what are we gonna do
with all Dutch's money?

37:20.835 --> 37:23.337
Gonna put it back where it belongs.

37:30.261 --> 37:32.913
- Hey, Miss Francine.
- Hey, Mr Johnson.

37:33.013 --> 37:35.333
Why didn't you say
we was going to see Francine?

37:35.433 --> 37:40.855
Hey, everybody! Got a gift from
Madam Queen, courtesy of Dutch Schultz!

37:47.445 --> 37:50.239
- There you go!
- A penny for everybody!

38:02.751 --> 38:05.254
These are very nice, John.

38:08.841 --> 38:11.343
First order of business.

38:15.097 --> 38:18.225
Like any square citizen,
we all have tax problems.

38:18.517 --> 38:21.270
But I have a solution.

38:25.232 --> 38:28.969
- Johnny.
- Mr G-G-Genovese.

38:29.069 --> 38:32.515
Mr C-C-Costello. Mr L-Lansky.

38:32.615 --> 38:36.268
Get on with it, John.
We ain't got all fuckin' day here.

38:36.368 --> 38:39.772
I have taken the liberty of
setting up for our use

38:39.872 --> 38:42.875
a number of accounts in Havana, Cuba.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.532
They are impervious
to the scrutiny of the feds there.

38:49.632 --> 38:52.451
At the request of my employer,
Lucky Luciano,

38:52.551 --> 38:57.890
I hereby offer these services
to each and every one of you.

39:03.854 --> 39:06.190
Second order of business.

39:11.153 --> 39:14.014
I'll wait.

39:14.114 --> 39:16.825
Excuse me.

39:17.785 --> 39:22.606
The only thing that threatens profits is the
unwanted attention of law enforcement.

39:22.706 --> 39:25.609
- I wanna talk about Dutch's activities.
- What about 'em?

39:25.709 --> 39:28.712
Got a call from Dewey.
He didn't appreciate your spree.

39:28.963 --> 39:31.323
I got it all under control.

39:31.423 --> 39:34.868
While he was up in Albany,
Bo Weinberg said just the opposite.

39:34.968 --> 39:36.745
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:36.845 --> 39:38.622
What did Bo say?

39:38.722 --> 39:41.625
One of the coloured bankers
don't wanna join you.

39:41.725 --> 39:45.921
He indicated you might need
a little help to straighten things out.

39:46.021 --> 39:51.151
Bo must've been having a bad day.
His wife ran off with a dago from Yonkers.

39:56.699 --> 40:00.227
I was gonna propose that
myself, Frank and Vito

40:00.327 --> 40:02.646
could lend you a little help.

40:02.746 --> 40:06.275
In return for a little piece, huh, Lucky?

40:06.375 --> 40:09.737
I come to you guys a year ago
saying we should go uptown.

40:09.837 --> 40:13.157
You said nigger pennies
was a waste of fuckin' time.

40:13.257 --> 40:16.427
So, to you and your proposal,
I say only one thing.

40:17.177 --> 40:20.180
Take a flying fuck!

40:22.182 --> 40:26.420
Always missing the point. OK, Dutch,
you're on your own. Do as you wish.

40:26.520 --> 40:30.132
If you need help from us
down the line, from us dagos,

40:30.232 --> 40:32.151
your price just went up.

40:32.317 --> 40:35.946
On that note, this meeting's adjourned.

40:36.780 --> 40:40.392
Louis, Meyer, Frank, Vito,
can I see you in my library?

40:40.492 --> 40:43.078
Nick, show Mr Schultz to the door.

40:44.496 --> 40:47.191
Put your hat back on.

40:47.291 --> 40:49.793
You look ridiculous.

40:53.255 --> 40:56.575
You in big trouble.
There's no other way to say it.

40:56.675 --> 40:58.969
She'll be right down.

41:03.265 --> 41:05.751
Gonna take your hat off
in the house, Bear?

41:05.851 --> 41:08.604
Now you're giving me lessons on manners.

41:10.189 --> 41:13.467
Goddamn! Look at the titties
on that statue!

41:13.567 --> 41:15.844
Boy, if I...

41:15.944 --> 41:19.072
Imbécile!

41:24.036 --> 41:26.313
I hope you're proud of yourself!

41:26.413 --> 41:29.833
You have dishonoured my name
with your betrayal.

41:30.125 --> 41:35.823
Who are you? Dutch Schultz burn down
three of me policy houses today!

41:35.923 --> 41:38.992
So we burn down three of his.
An eye for an eye.

41:39.092 --> 41:42.496
So you're the Queen now, eh?
Who runnin' this operation?

41:42.596 --> 41:46.558
- You.
- Then why you disregard my orders?

41:47.434 --> 41:52.214
You think I don't know why you're
sticking close to me? I see your ambition.

41:52.314 --> 41:56.802
- It was time to take a stand.
- I take care of Schultz meself!

41:56.902 --> 42:01.198
- I am the Queen!
- But you are afraid of him.

42:03.033 --> 42:07.829
Never thought I'd see the day
that you were afraid of any man.

42:08.538 --> 42:13.235
Of course I'm afraid.
But fear be a good thing sometime.

42:13.335 --> 42:16.046
It checks the angry spirit.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.492
I can beat him, Queen.
I can beat the Dutchman at his own game.

42:20.592 --> 42:25.163
Use your head, Bumpy.
Where you think they gonna fight this war?

42:25.263 --> 42:27.749
On Park Avenue?

42:27.849 --> 42:30.335
Non. Mais non.

42:30.435 --> 42:35.941
Here. Right here,
on the streets of Harlem.

42:36.483 --> 42:39.219
I'm prepared to deal
with the consequences of that.

42:39.319 --> 42:41.488
And what about the rest of us?

42:42.614 --> 42:46.243
You open the faucet of blood,
you never shut it off.

42:52.666 --> 42:54.651
Three fuckin' grand?

42:54.751 --> 42:57.337
We hear this guy's a real tornado.

43:04.678 --> 43:08.540
Hey, Bub, you're gonna kill
my English ivy tree there.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.916
I'm sorry.

43:10.016 --> 43:13.670
Dutch, the Salkes are the best
pickaxe boys in the business.

43:13.770 --> 43:16.898
They'll turn this guy into a sieve.

43:21.194 --> 43:24.097
Ah, maybe the three grand's worth it, huh?

43:24.197 --> 43:27.309
I remember the days you could get
a guy hit for 40 bucks.

43:27.409 --> 43:32.539
- We live in inflationary times.
- Ain't that the fuckin' truth!

43:36.543 --> 43:39.045
Don't come back without him.

43:41.047 --> 43:45.427
- You're under arrest!
- Foley, you mick, get over here!

43:47.888 --> 43:49.956
Hey, had you, didn't I, lads?

43:50.056 --> 43:52.476
How ya doin', Cap?

43:54.311 --> 43:57.714
Well, ain't it the short arm of the law.

43:57.814 --> 44:00.717
You beat up any niggers lately?

44:00.817 --> 44:03.945
No, I'm sorry to say I haven't. Have you?

44:08.825 --> 44:10.477
How's tricks?

44:10.577 --> 44:15.540
We live in inflationary fuckin' times.
How'd it go with Judge Capshaw?

44:15.790 --> 44:19.903
He told me Stephanie St Clair
offered him 20,000 to shut you down.

44:20.003 --> 44:23.490
No shit? Well, I'm flattered.

44:23.590 --> 44:27.619
You've gotta give that black bitch
credit. She's a wily old horse.

44:27.719 --> 44:30.622
So, how much to top her ice?

44:30.722 --> 44:34.334
- Capshaw wants forty.
- He's a greedy bastard.

44:34.434 --> 44:36.545
Judges don't come cheap, Arthur.

44:36.645 --> 44:39.673
That's true.
They're the crookedest crooks around.

44:39.773 --> 44:44.511
With a bit of proper evidence,
he can guarantee a conviction.

44:44.611 --> 44:47.764
- Get the policy paper?
- I'm on it.

44:47.864 --> 44:50.559
What about them Salke brothers, huh?

44:50.659 --> 44:54.479
How would you like one of them
fuckin' your sister?

44:54.579 --> 44:58.124
Well, it's better than some
I could think of.

45:02.671 --> 45:04.923
Don't knock on my door

45:07.259 --> 45:12.264
I done told you two or three times
I don't want you no more

45:13.431 --> 45:18.170
I run in here, baby, cos I got kinda sick
Ain't nothing ailing my stomach

45:18.270 --> 45:22.048
It's something wrong with my...
Dixieland was a camp in Georgia

45:22.148 --> 45:24.901
You can't stay there very long

45:26.111 --> 45:31.391
All the friends I had
done shook hands and gone

45:31.491 --> 45:34.769
Mr Johnson.
Mr Johnson, I work at the pool hall.

45:34.869 --> 45:39.900
I wanna work for you. I promise I'll
be the fastest runner you ever seen.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.903
The Queen ain't hiring no runners, son.
Neither am I.

45:43.003 --> 45:45.280
Besides, ain't it past your bedtime?

45:45.380 --> 45:48.241
Oh, man, I'm gonna close this party down!

45:48.341 --> 45:53.138
..told you two or three times
I don't want no junk

46:00.562 --> 46:05.091
Bumpy Johnson! My name
Miss Philmore. I'm Danny's mother.

46:05.191 --> 46:06.217
Ma'am.

46:06.317 --> 46:10.096
I wish more of our coloured men
would stand up and fight for they home.

46:10.196 --> 46:12.182
The way you doin' against Dutch.

46:12.282 --> 46:14.768
I heard you killed three of his men.

46:14.868 --> 46:18.355
Like the Lord swooped in
on Sodom and Gomorrah,

46:18.455 --> 46:22.609
you swung your mighty scythe and them
heathen heads rolled on the pavement!

46:22.709 --> 46:25.570
- Yes, ma'am.
- You a killin' machine!

46:25.670 --> 46:30.967
Ooh, Mr Johnson, you somethin' else!
I'm telling you, you just a killer!

46:32.635 --> 46:34.721
Thanks, everybody.

46:38.516 --> 46:40.727
Francine. Francine.

46:41.811 --> 46:44.089
- Francine.
- Bumpy Johnson!

46:44.189 --> 46:47.717
Mr Johnson, I been singing
for you a long time now.

46:47.817 --> 46:51.262
I been tryin' to get a job
at the Cotton Club for six months.

46:51.362 --> 46:54.683
Look here, come down to the Bamville.
See my man Calvin.

46:54.783 --> 46:58.728
He's a cleanhead man. He does
the hiring. Would you excuse me?

46:58.828 --> 47:02.290
- He gonna take care of me?
- He'll take care of you.

47:06.044 --> 47:08.129
What's wrong?

47:17.180 --> 47:21.543
What was I supposed to do, Francine?
Let 'em kill the Queen?

47:21.643 --> 47:25.271
You shot three people.
Don't you have any remorse?

47:26.481 --> 47:29.717
Remorse comes when you feel
you've done something wrong.

47:29.817 --> 47:34.180
- You don't think killing is wrong?
- Innocent people, yes.

47:34.280 --> 47:37.450
There's been 35 lynchings this year alone.

47:38.284 --> 47:41.688
Depression got people starving
all over the country.

47:41.788 --> 47:45.400
Scottsboro boys... in jail
for a crime they didn't commit.

47:45.500 --> 47:48.194
All of that is wrong.

47:48.294 --> 47:50.905
Yeah, I understand all that.

47:51.005 --> 47:52.866
But?

47:52.966 --> 47:55.260
But I don't understand you.

47:57.220 --> 47:59.330
You're a gentleman, you're a poet,

47:59.430 --> 48:03.626
you're nice to people,
you think about things.

48:03.726 --> 48:07.714
And then, within a blink of an eye,

48:07.814 --> 48:10.316
you can kill or be killed.

48:11.651 --> 48:14.470
Is there nothing in this world

48:14.570 --> 48:16.931
that you love enough

48:17.031 --> 48:19.742
that you would kill for it or die for it?

48:22.620 --> 48:24.914
I don't know.

49:01.617 --> 49:04.103
I'd give my left nut
for a piece of cheesecake.

49:04.203 --> 49:07.023
- Who makes the best in New York?
- Junior's.

49:07.123 --> 49:10.276
- Lindy's.
- Best sauerbraten?

49:10.376 --> 49:13.571

49:19.343 --> 49:22.055
- Luger's.
- Gallagher's.

49:24.015 --> 49:26.517
Now, let's do some damage.

49:39.822 --> 49:43.351
I'm tired of going to church
without my man.

49:43.451 --> 49:48.122
I told you, Francine. The good Lord
and I have an arrangement.

49:49.040 --> 49:52.794
I don't go into his house.
He doesn't come into mine.

49:56.088 --> 50:01.744
OK, you heathen. That's the last time
I try to save your soul.

50:01.844 --> 50:05.289
Aw, don't be that way, baby.

50:05.389 --> 50:08.518
Besides, you know you're my religion.

50:15.733 --> 50:17.819
- Good night.
- Good night.

50:29.705 --> 50:32.400
- Best martini?

50:36.921 --> 50:39.490
- Best Italian?
- Patsy's.

50:39.590 --> 50:42.702
- Rao's.

50:42.802 --> 50:45.304
- Ratner's.
- Katz's.

50:47.265 --> 50:50.726
- Best frankfurter?
- Nathan's.

51:02.405 --> 51:05.116
Hey, hey, hey!

51:05.491 --> 51:08.227
What the fuck you doin' up here?

51:08.327 --> 51:13.357
Silent night

51:13.457 --> 51:17.612
- Did you hear what I said?
- Holy night

51:17.712 --> 51:20.406
What the fuck you...

51:20.506 --> 51:24.343
Silent night...

53:42.565 --> 53:44.842
Give me the gun.

53:44.942 --> 53:47.511
It's all right.
It's all right, give me the gun.

53:47.611 --> 53:50.139
It's all right. It's all right.

53:50.239 --> 53:54.518
It's all right. It's just you and me.
It's just gonna be you and me.

53:54.618 --> 54:00.040
I promise. I promise. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

54:00.791 --> 54:03.711
It's all right. It's all right.

54:16.599 --> 54:20.544
Lord have mercy! I didn't know
Josephine Baker worked here!

54:20.644 --> 54:25.316
Miss Baker, I thought you was in France.
Where is Pigfoot Mary?

54:26.108 --> 54:28.944
Give me 60 cents on 409.

54:30.070 --> 54:32.323
60 cents on 409 straight.

54:32.823 --> 54:35.326
All right, I heard you.

54:38.329 --> 54:42.942
No, you hold onto that. Your money
ain't no good here. I'll take care of that.

54:43.042 --> 54:47.488
Oh, come on now, Mary. The governor
pardon folks quicker than you do!

54:47.588 --> 54:52.968
Mm-mm. And if you don't quit mackin'
me so hard, I'm gonna crush your spine.

54:53.552 --> 54:57.973
Woman, now you're talkin' my language!

55:00.225 --> 55:03.295
- Come on. Give me some sugar now.
- Get outta here!

55:03.395 --> 55:07.274
That's all right. You gonna wanna
kiss me sometime later.

55:09.026 --> 55:14.531
Hello, Tiny. Well, let's see what
the good doctor has in his little black bag.

55:15.032 --> 55:17.326
Come on, now. Give it over.

55:22.373 --> 55:26.919
Hey! What the hell wrong? You got
no cause to be beatin' up on him!

55:27.753 --> 55:30.990
Would you rather it be you?
Cos we're here to serve.

55:31.090 --> 55:34.118
That's what I thought.
All right, boys, get the bag.

55:34.218 --> 55:38.330
- OK!
- Well, maybe next time.

55:38.430 --> 55:40.516
Toodle-oo.

55:41.558 --> 55:44.728
It's all right, Daddy. It's OK.
Momma's here.

55:53.237 --> 55:56.698
C'est fait accompli, mais non?
Don't fret yourself.

55:57.407 --> 55:59.852
What do you think you should've done, huh?

55:59.952 --> 56:03.480
Let that pickaxe-waving devil
just kill Bumpy?

56:03.580 --> 56:05.916
You done right, sweetheart.

56:06.208 --> 56:10.587
The Lord knows there's a shortage
of eligible men in this town.

56:30.816 --> 56:34.152
Well, if it isn't Madam Queen.

56:36.572 --> 56:38.782
Speak your business.

56:40.325 --> 56:42.978
Stephanie St Clair, you are under arrest

56:43.078 --> 56:47.583
for violation of city code
section 1 7-64: illegal gambling.

56:50.043 --> 56:53.171
- You be careful, Captain.
- Likewise.

56:55.591 --> 56:58.260
All right, boys. Take her away.

57:13.150 --> 57:18.305
This morning, the Queen turned over
control of the bank to me.

57:18.405 --> 57:22.768
Now, she asked me to take
every precaution available

57:22.868 --> 57:25.687
to avoid shedding any blood.

57:25.787 --> 57:29.858
How we gonna get people to come to
work if we don't stop the son of a bitch?

57:29.958 --> 57:33.070
- Yeah!
- By being smart.

57:33.170 --> 57:35.781
By using the old idea pot. Vallie!

57:35.881 --> 57:38.909
- Yes, sir!
- You in charge of the policy room.

57:39.009 --> 57:41.553
OK, go to every controller's house.

57:41.678 --> 57:44.790
- You tell 'em this building is protected.
- Done.

57:44.890 --> 57:49.461
Calvin, establish new routes for the
runners when they collect the slips.

57:49.561 --> 57:53.482
Whispers, Waldo, I want y'all
to beef up security on the premises.

57:53.607 --> 57:56.927
- You got it, Bump.
- That cop Foley's in Dutch's pocket.

57:57.027 --> 57:59.388
He just as crooked as the letter ''S''.

57:59.488 --> 58:01.948
He gonna come after them slips
the way he did me.

58:02.074 --> 58:06.603
If he get 'em, you and the Queen
gonna be right back in the joint.

58:06.703 --> 58:10.315
We'll hide the slips so none of
these flatfoot can find 'em.

58:10.415 --> 58:14.152
When the number come out at the end
of the day, we burn the slips.

58:14.252 --> 58:15.904
- Excuse me...
- Shut up!

58:16.004 --> 58:19.366
Hey, hey, let the kid speak.
What's on your mind, kid?

58:19.466 --> 58:21.535
Folks is confused, that's all.

58:21.635 --> 58:24.871
I mean, all them policy slips
are on white paper.

58:24.971 --> 58:27.666
If people wanna play a number,
they fill out a slip.

58:27.766 --> 58:30.585
They don't know whose bank
they playin' with.

58:30.685 --> 58:33.755
- What's your point, kid?
- We should use different paper.

58:33.855 --> 58:37.551
It's the most flumadiddle idea ever!
You sniffin' that Shinola?

58:37.651 --> 58:42.155
Hold on there, Vallie. Hold on.
The boy got a good idea.

58:42.823 --> 58:44.891
- What's your name?
- Tyrone, sir.

58:44.991 --> 58:50.205
All right, Tyrone. We're gonna change
the colour of our slips to, say, green.

58:50.330 --> 58:52.691
Waldo, go down to the print shop.

58:52.791 --> 58:54.901
Pick us up a bushel of green slips.

58:55.001 --> 58:58.922
Everybody know they buyin' from us
and the Queen's still carrying power.

58:59.047 --> 59:03.285
I know every alley in this whole damn
neighbourhood. Let me run for you.

59:03.385 --> 59:07.789
All right, son. You done came up with
a good idea. Let's leave it at that.

59:07.889 --> 59:11.626
- Run your ass around the corner!
- Laugh if you want to.

59:11.726 --> 59:15.380
But even I know that if Dutch takes over,
that's not what she wrote.

59:15.480 --> 59:19.926
Besides, old Ray told me
you started running when you was 16.

59:20.026 --> 59:23.029
- Hell, I'm 1 7.
- Oh, no!

59:25.824 --> 59:28.160
Come on, Mr Johnson. You can trust me.

59:34.082 --> 59:36.793
OK, Tyrone.

59:40.338 --> 59:43.466
But you better not frog up on me, boy.

59:44.134 --> 59:46.219
You hear?

59:47.095 --> 59:49.389
No, sir.

59:50.682 --> 59:53.794
Well, Bumpy, you know we all with you.

59:53.894 --> 59:58.523
- You can confidence that now.
- We right with you, Bumpy.

01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:14.915
It's your time, Bumpy.

01:02:14.284 --> 01:02:16.978
I've built a nice mahogany coffin.

01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:21.833
Mother-of-pearl inlay,
solid brass handles.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:26.112
My son did a beautiful job
with the bullet wounds.

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:29.090
He looks like he died in his sleep.

01:02:35.096 --> 01:02:37.056
Thank you, Mr Johnson.

01:02:39.767 --> 01:02:42.462
Thank heaven for Mr Johnson.

01:02:42.562 --> 01:02:47.233
That man done brought prosperity
back to this neighbourhood.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.630
You have my deepest sympathies,
Mrs Anders.

01:03:09.714 --> 01:03:13.493
I scrubbed kitchen floors 20 years
to get that boy a home.

01:03:13.593 --> 01:03:17.805
Tyrone was a fine young man
and he died with honour.

01:03:18.306 --> 01:03:20.391
Honour?

01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:25.396
He's dead, Mr Johnson.

01:03:26.105 --> 01:03:29.359
Where is the honour in that?

01:03:32.612 --> 01:03:34.697
I'm...

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:38.309
sorry.

01:03:38.409 --> 01:03:41.329
People call you a hero.

01:03:43.831 --> 01:03:46.793
You just a common thief!

01:03:48.711 --> 01:03:54.300
You stole the only reason I had to live.

01:04:09.482 --> 01:04:15.305
See that? Every soul in Harlem played
235 because of this damn headline.

01:04:15.405 --> 01:04:17.890
Well, people are superstitious, you know.

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:20.852
Well, I don't know
what we gonna do after this one.

01:04:20.952 --> 01:04:24.080
Cos if we hit hard,
this might be 80 grand.

01:04:24.872 --> 01:04:28.443
Pigfoot told me that Dutch changed
his number to 236.

01:04:28.543 --> 01:04:30.612
We are not gonna do that.

01:04:30.712 --> 01:04:34.032
People play the number,
they expect to get paid when they hit.

01:04:34.132 --> 01:04:36.242
We're just gonna have to pay 'em.

01:04:36.342 --> 01:04:39.370
And that's the difference
between you and Dutch.

01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:42.348
And that's why I love you.

01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:46.269
Oh, cut it out!

01:04:47.019 --> 01:04:49.714
Boy, I sure wish I could find Miss Right.

01:04:49.814 --> 01:04:53.009
Shit! I don't mean that.
I'm looking for Miss Right Now.

01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:55.636
- Go on, make the payoffs.
- You the boss, Bumpy.

01:04:55.736 --> 01:04:57.805
I'm gonna make the payoffs.

01:04:57.905 --> 01:05:01.017
You know what 235 mean
in Madam Zora's dream book.

01:05:01.117 --> 01:05:04.145
- No. What?
- Death.

01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:09.025
Yeah. Well, when I see him, I'm gonna
tell him I changed his number for today.

01:05:09.125 --> 01:05:12.712
- Yes, sir. Good day, Miss Francine.
- Good day.

01:05:13.754 --> 01:05:16.783
Here you go, Mr Johnson.

01:05:16.883 --> 01:05:18.201
Enjoy.

01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:21.162
What are you doing?
You don't like banana splits.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:25.183
- I like your banana splits.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:05:25.308 --> 01:05:27.835
What's wrong?

01:05:27.935 --> 01:05:31.339
- Mr Redmond.
- Yes, sir, Mr Johnson?

01:05:31.439 --> 01:05:36.260
- Do you see these almonds on my split?
- Yes, sir. I see them almonds.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.738
You know I don't like almonds on my split.

01:05:39.697 --> 01:05:44.285
Yes, sir, Mr Johnson. I know
you don't like almonds on your split.

01:05:44.577 --> 01:05:47.063
Did you put these almonds on my split?

01:05:47.163 --> 01:05:51.083
- No, sir, Mr Johnson.
- Then who did?

01:05:51.334 --> 01:05:53.794
Jimmy, the new boy.

01:05:54.337 --> 01:05:58.382
Jimmy, give me a few ticks.

01:05:58.883 --> 01:06:02.954
- What's up, Bump?
- Bumpy, don't start anything.

01:06:03.054 --> 01:06:06.082
- It's all right.
- What can I do for you, Mr Johnson?

01:06:06.182 --> 01:06:08.668
Did Mr Redmond tell you
I don't like almonds?

01:06:08.768 --> 01:06:12.505
- Oh, boy!
- Yes, he did. I must've made a mistake.

01:06:12.605 --> 01:06:18.719
Oh, that's all right. Listen,
why don't you bring me some hot fudge?

01:06:18.819 --> 01:06:21.931
- See if you got any hot fudge.
- What is wrong with you?

01:06:22.031 --> 01:06:25.351
Nothing. I just wanna show
Jimmy the difference

01:06:25.451 --> 01:06:29.689
between a traditional split
and the way I like mine.

01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:31.566
- Here you go.
- Have a seat.

01:06:31.666 --> 01:06:34.193
I wanna show you how to make
a traditional split.

01:06:34.293 --> 01:06:36.696
Then I'll show you
how I like to have a split.

01:06:36.796 --> 01:06:39.282
A traditional split
has all these trimmings.

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:44.036
The almonds, the whipped cream,
the cherry and the hot fudge.

01:06:44.136 --> 01:06:48.641
Jimmy, why don't you sample that,
tell me what you think?

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.670
No, thanks, Mr Johnson.
I'm allergic to ice cream.

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:55.690
Allergic to ice cream?

01:07:01.112 --> 01:07:04.448
Sounds to me like you're
allergic to rat poison, boy.

01:07:05.116 --> 01:07:06.909
Let me do him, Bumpy!

01:07:08.995 --> 01:07:11.272
Put the knife down, Vallie.

01:07:11.372 --> 01:07:14.275
Mr Johnson, I swear I didn't know!

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:16.752
He said you wanted that boy to work here.

01:07:17.003 --> 01:07:19.505
Who said I wanted this boy to work here?

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:28.723
Who said I wanted this boy
to work here, Mr Redmond?

01:07:29.265 --> 01:07:31.542
- Vallie.
- Say it ain't so, Vallie!

01:07:31.642 --> 01:07:34.186
Die, motherfucker!

01:07:38.649 --> 01:07:42.762
Whispers, bring him over here
and sit him down.

01:07:42.862 --> 01:07:45.222
Come on, sit him down.

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:48.434
Calvin, get Vallie outta here.

01:07:48.534 --> 01:07:52.438
- Don't breathe.
- Lowlife snake!

01:07:52.538 --> 01:07:54.832
Open that damn door. Get outta here!

01:07:55.082 --> 01:07:57.835
Francine, you go home with Whispers.

01:08:01.255 --> 01:08:04.909
Relax, Jimmy. Relax.

01:08:05.009 --> 01:08:08.179
- Bumpy.
- He'll be OK.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.311
Mr Johnson...

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:23.694
Eat.

01:08:28.448 --> 01:08:30.743
He said eat!

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.374
- Mr Johnson...
- Eat.

01:08:45.925 --> 01:08:48.327
- Mr Redmond.
- Yes, sir, Mr Johnson.

01:08:48.426 --> 01:08:51.913
From now on, you make my split.

01:08:52.014 --> 01:08:54.308
Yes, sir, Mr Johnson.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.817
You got me all wrong, Bumpy!

01:09:06.111 --> 01:09:10.890
- I just wanna know why, Vallie.
- Dutch gave me $3,000.

01:09:10.991 --> 01:09:14.270
- You know how much money that is?
- That's a handsome ransom.

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.229
- Yes, sir.
- Let me go

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:20.667
and I'll be on the first smoker
to Philly tonight. I promise!

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.741
That's a nice ring, Vallie. Did you get that
with the money that Dutch gave you?

01:09:27.841 --> 01:09:32.328
I got that from my Aunt Helen! It's
just a dime-store trick. I've had it years!

01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:35.957
- I ain't never seen it.
- Bumpy, please!

01:09:36.058 --> 01:09:41.212
You's a merciful man!
So, Bumpy, Bumpy, I'm begging you...

01:09:41.313 --> 01:09:45.843
Please, Bumpy, let me go! I promise
I'll be on the first train to Philly!

01:09:45.943 --> 01:09:48.319
OK. Come on, Vallie. Vallie.

01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:50.990
Shh shh shh. Come on. Get up.

01:09:52.283 --> 01:09:54.810
Bumpy... Please, please, Bumpy.

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.413
You gonna be all right.

01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:01.458
You hear?

01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:05.321
Go on. Have a seat.

01:10:05.421 --> 01:10:09.800
All right. Thank you.
Thank you, Bumpy. Thank you, Bumpy.

01:10:12.219 --> 01:10:14.680
- Go on, now, drink up.
- Thank you, Bumpy.

01:10:14.805 --> 01:10:17.641
God bless you, Bumpy. God bless you.

01:10:19.977 --> 01:10:21.437
Dirt!

01:10:22.271 --> 01:10:25.607
S-s-s-s-s-snake!

01:10:51.675 --> 01:10:54.011
How you doin', Vallie?

01:11:54.363 --> 01:11:58.909
It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing...

01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:02.062
If Ziegfeld doesn't put you
in his fuckin' chorus,

01:12:02.162 --> 01:12:05.691
I'll put his head in a fuckin'
meat grinder! I swear to Christ!

01:12:05.791 --> 01:12:08.610
You'd do that for me? Isn't he romantic?

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:11.547
A regular Rudy Valentino!

01:12:12.756 --> 01:12:16.635
- Hey! Where's he going?
- He thinks he owns the joint.

01:12:18.554 --> 01:12:23.850
It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing...

01:12:28.105 --> 01:12:31.233
Hey, Owney, look what I fuckin' got!

01:12:39.992 --> 01:12:43.912
- No coloureds allowed in here.
- It's a new day, motherfucker!

01:13:07.978 --> 01:13:13.108
He's the guy who got Duke to work the club.
He's probably here to collect his fee.

01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:16.220
Go to the back door.
What the hell are you doing to me?

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.431
Disregard the fee, Owney.
I came to talk to the Dutchman.

01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.643
All right. You struck a blow
for the negro cause.

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:25.187
The first nigger
to get into the Cotton Club.

01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:28.899
- Now, get out!
- Do you know my man Whispers?

01:13:28.999 --> 01:13:31.151
Like you and I, he's a fan of Ellington.

01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:36.949
He'd appreciate it if you would sit down
and take it easy for a few ticks.

01:13:37.049 --> 01:13:39.117
Dutch, that was quite a performance.

01:13:39.217 --> 01:13:43.680
I didn't realise that you people
had such rhythm.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.960
- How's business?
- Not bad.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.128
But let me tell you about yours.

01:13:50.228 --> 01:13:52.965
Your bank is at 351 Lenox Avenue.

01:13:53.065 --> 01:13:57.302
You runnin' policy out of stores
on Amsterdam, St Nick and Madison.

01:13:57.402 --> 01:14:01.181
I'm here to tell you you're shutting
your operations down tomorrow.

01:14:01.281 --> 01:14:04.601
You don't, I shut you down myself.

01:14:04.701 --> 01:14:07.162
- Is that so?
- Oh, that's so.

01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:13.210
I thought all you niggers
travelled in packs.

01:14:13.335 --> 01:14:16.338
Where's my buddy, Vallie?

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:21.092
Vallie had to leave town in a hurry,
but he left something for you.

01:14:22.135 --> 01:14:24.413
Here.

01:14:24.513 --> 01:14:27.416
Go ahead.
Pick yourself a winner with that.

01:14:27.516 --> 01:14:30.836
- I'm gonna be sick!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:14:30.936 --> 01:14:34.606
You've been warned.
Get ready for your final thrill.

01:14:35.106 --> 01:14:36.883
No! Not in here!

01:14:36.983 --> 01:14:40.904
No, no! Not in the Cotton Club.
No guns in here. No! Outside.

01:14:41.863 --> 01:14:45.784
- Get the fuck outta here!
- It's curtains, Dutch.

01:14:45.909 --> 01:14:48.620
The jig is up.

01:14:50.372 --> 01:14:52.774
You're a dead fuckin' nigger!

01:14:52.874 --> 01:14:56.361
You hear me? You're dead!

01:14:56.461 --> 01:14:59.965
You come uptown. You come uptown!

01:15:00.966 --> 01:15:03.577
Bring Francie with ya.
I'll fuck her for ya!

01:15:03.677 --> 01:15:08.682
I hear she needs it. I know where
your high-yellow bitch is living!

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.608
You boys, do like I say do.

01:15:20.569 --> 01:15:24.489
There's enough dynamite
in these three crates

01:15:25.365 --> 01:15:28.493
to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:15:30.412 --> 01:15:35.417
I've set the timer for seven minutes. When
you're making the drop, pull the switch.

01:15:35.792 --> 01:15:38.587
Seven minutes and the bomb
goes off, right?

01:15:38.878 --> 01:15:41.239
I'm a professional, Mr Johnson.

01:15:41.339 --> 01:15:44.326
The question ain't what time
the bomb is gonna go off,

01:15:44.426 --> 01:15:48.872
it's whether you boys will get out
before it does. Do you understand?

01:15:48.972 --> 01:15:53.351
- Yeah, we feature what you're saying.
- Bumpy, Dutch got all his men uptown.

01:15:53.643 --> 01:15:58.773
His main liquor warehouse is downtown.
That's where he makes his longest green.

01:15:58.898 --> 01:16:01.927
You talking about going downtown
to blow this man's shit up?

01:16:02.027 --> 01:16:05.222
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Too risky.

01:16:05.322 --> 01:16:07.866
Besides, the Queen would be against it.

01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:13.330
The Queen ain't here, Whispers. And
while she ain't here, I'm carrying power.

01:16:14.539 --> 01:16:17.275
OK.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:20.278
Calvin, I want you to cover the bank.
30, 40 men.

01:16:20.378 --> 01:16:24.115
- Got it.
- Whispers, look after Francine.

01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:29.246
I'm trusting you with her life.
Me and Illinois will make the drop.

01:16:29.346 --> 01:16:32.040
Yeah, all right. That's good.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.794
I like that.
You know I'm with you, cousin.

01:16:35.894 --> 01:16:38.188
From the womb to the tomb.

01:16:54.204 --> 01:16:56.815
What's the matter?

01:16:56.915 --> 01:16:58.984
I don't wanna die, Bumpy.

01:16:59.084 --> 01:17:02.404
Remember when I came up from
South Carolina... how scared I was?

01:17:02.504 --> 01:17:06.157
Never seen that many people
in one place. Scared me to death.

01:17:06.257 --> 01:17:10.095
- I remember. I'm not that old.
- You remember what you said to me?

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.041
Yeah. I told you I'd look after you.
Wouldn't let nothing happen to you.

01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.812
Look me in my eye and tell me
you think I'm carrying you downtown

01:17:18.937 --> 01:17:20.605
so you can die.

01:17:20.897 --> 01:17:23.441
- I know you don't want that to happen.
- I need you.

01:17:23.566 --> 01:17:25.677
Some things, a man can't do alone.

01:17:25.777 --> 01:17:29.697
I need my man hard down
with his boots laced up.

01:17:31.324 --> 01:17:34.369
Now, you with me?

01:17:40.792 --> 01:17:41.793
OK, Bumpy.

01:17:44.087 --> 01:17:47.699
- Did you set that timer, cousin?
- Yeah, we got seven minutes.

01:17:47.799 --> 01:17:50.510
You got your boots laced up?

01:17:52.262 --> 01:17:55.582
All right!
You don't need no liquor, Illinois.

01:17:55.682 --> 01:17:59.018
- Long as you with me, you're safe.
- All right.

01:18:00.353 --> 01:18:03.064
We can celebrate later, right?

01:18:22.292 --> 01:18:25.253
- What's this shit here?
- Yeast delivery.

01:18:38.558 --> 01:18:41.019
Yeast for the beer, sir.

01:18:44.606 --> 01:18:48.192
- Take your ass on in there.
- Thank you.

01:19:10.965 --> 01:19:13.451
We got three minutes.

01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:17.163
You boys are late. You're slowing
down my brewery. Where's Eugene?

01:19:17.263 --> 01:19:19.332
Um, he couldn't make it, sir.

01:19:19.432 --> 01:19:23.353
Come on, move your asses!
Get the yeast on the dock.

01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:28.566
Jesus Christ!

01:19:30.693 --> 01:19:33.071
Come on!

01:19:33.988 --> 01:19:35.865
That's it, sir.

01:19:37.784 --> 01:19:41.120
I just need you to sign
on the dotted line.

01:19:42.747 --> 01:19:44.832
We need to be going now.

01:19:47.627 --> 01:19:51.990
- What's wrong with you, boy?
- Nothin', boss. Just a little tired.

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:55.843
We got all these deliveries still to make.

01:20:01.933 --> 01:20:04.877
I don't understand why Eugene
couldn't make the run.

01:20:04.977 --> 01:20:09.398
Eugene went out last night and got
just as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.

01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:12.610
That's when they called us, sir.

01:20:17.073 --> 01:20:19.450
Eugene's a fucking Mormon. He don't drink.

01:20:19.575 --> 01:20:24.163
That's the problem.
He got himself kicked out the church.

01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:28.918
Hey, where you goin'?

01:20:30.795 --> 01:20:32.864
We don't want no trouble, sir.

01:20:32.964 --> 01:20:36.884
Like I said,
we just got all these deliveries.

01:20:38.719 --> 01:20:42.165
You boys stay put. I'm gonna get the boss.

01:20:42.265 --> 01:20:45.393
- Don't move.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:02.618 --> 01:21:03.953
Hey!

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:11.711
Hit the gas!

01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:39.780
Now, I'll ask you one more time!
Where is he?

01:21:39.906 --> 01:21:42.617
I don't know! I don't know...

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:45.786
Hey, Dutch, you don't have to do that.

01:21:49.665 --> 01:21:53.294
Hey, Bub, toughen up a little, will ya?

01:22:30.122 --> 01:22:32.625
Mary? Ohh...

01:23:07.743 --> 01:23:13.024
I've got bodies all over
the front page of the Daily News!

01:23:13.124 --> 01:23:16.861
I got that pansy Hoover calling me,
asking if I need his help.

01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:20.573
- You put my dick in a wringer.
- Dutch didn't instigate this.

01:23:20.673 --> 01:23:22.950
Let me explain something to you.

01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:28.264
If one crazy negro is provoked into
coming downtown, they'll all come.

01:23:29.723 --> 01:23:34.045
I can't afford to have all of Harlem
crossing the line because of you.

01:23:34.145 --> 01:23:36.839
You get this numbers thing settled,

01:23:36.939 --> 01:23:41.010
or I will launch an investigation
into every syndicate activity.

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:44.738
Do you get that, you wop pimp?

01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:05.951
Vide 'o mare quant'è bello

01:24:06.051 --> 01:24:10.414
Spira tantu sentimento

01:24:10.514 --> 01:24:15.603
Comme tu a chi tiene mente

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.441
Ca scetato 'o fai sunnà

01:24:38.959 --> 01:24:41.654
I thought it was about time we meet,
Mr Johnson.

01:24:41.754 --> 01:24:44.990
- I was honoured by your invitation.
- Thank you.

01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:47.384
A friend in Sing Sing says you play chess.

01:24:47.593 --> 01:24:53.123
- You partake in the game?
- Nah. Only in its strategies.

01:24:53.223 --> 01:24:55.517
Franco, pigghia 'u cane.

01:24:57.519 --> 01:24:59.713
Shall we go for a walk?

01:24:59.813 --> 01:25:02.274
You're in good hands, boys.

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:07.221
I love this place.

01:25:07.321 --> 01:25:11.892
I was under the impression that you
and the Dutchman were partners.

01:25:11.992 --> 01:25:17.648
Dutch Schultz doesn't recognise that
a partnership requires compromises.

01:25:17.748 --> 01:25:21.043
I think you do.
This is about money, Mr Johnson.

01:25:21.794 --> 01:25:25.573
If you get a piece of my operation,
what will you offer me in return?

01:25:25.673 --> 01:25:28.033
For starters, political connections.

01:25:28.133 --> 01:25:31.620
The kind that'll keep you
from suffering like Madam St Clair.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.766
If a man wants to be successful in
this business, he has to make alliances.

01:25:36.016 --> 01:25:38.419
- You got judges?
- Even better.

01:25:38.519 --> 01:25:40.796
The special prosecutor.

01:25:40.896 --> 01:25:45.067
- Thomas Dewey?
- He's as greedy as the rest of them.

01:25:49.822 --> 01:25:53.742
I appreciate your offer,
but my answer is no.

01:25:54.702 --> 01:25:59.415
- I'm strictly an independent operator.
- So be it.

01:26:01.291 --> 01:26:04.320
But your move downtown
affects me as well as Mr Schultz.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.298
It was a clever gambit,
Mr Johnson... your brewery job.

01:26:08.507 --> 01:26:11.285
But a meeting is required
to discuss these problems.

01:26:11.385 --> 01:26:13.537
The Dutchman and I are past discussion.

01:26:13.637 --> 01:26:17.641
It's not a request.
I'll call you with the time.

01:26:18.725 --> 01:26:19.977
What can I do you for?

01:26:20.102 --> 01:26:24.298
This thing between you and Mr Johnson
has gone way past bedtime.

01:26:24.398 --> 01:26:28.719
Why do you give a fuck? It ain't got
nothing to do with your whore business.

01:26:28.819 --> 01:26:31.363
If Tom Dewey clamps down,
it affects all of us.

01:26:31.613 --> 01:26:33.974
I'm the guy Dewey's
having wet dreams about.

01:26:34.074 --> 01:26:38.729
Exactly. Numbers has him looking to
open up a pan on all our business.

01:26:38.829 --> 01:26:41.373
You get me out of fuckin' bed for this?

01:26:41.498 --> 01:26:44.818
What's the other news?
Roosevelt running for re-election?

01:26:44.918 --> 01:26:49.715
Close. I wanna bring
Mr Johnson to our table.

01:26:49.923 --> 01:26:53.452
We do not bring that nigger
into my presence.

01:26:53.552 --> 01:26:57.081
We're having a sit-down, Dutch.
We're gonna settle things.

01:26:57.181 --> 01:27:00.793
- Is this your fuckin' strategy?
- My strategy is to keep order.

01:27:00.893 --> 01:27:03.587
My responsibility is the bigger picture.

01:27:03.687 --> 01:27:08.483
If I say no, does Vito send his boys to my
house in the middle of the fuckin' night?

01:27:08.609 --> 01:27:11.945
I'm warning you, Luciano.
Don't fuck with me.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:17.101
- You been outvoted.
- OK, have it your way.

01:27:17.201 --> 01:27:20.913
Bring him to the fucking table.
Have him over for fuckin' dinner.

01:27:21.288 --> 01:27:23.290
Cecil, pull the fuck over!

01:27:27.294 --> 01:27:30.839
Where are you going?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

01:27:34.676 --> 01:27:37.788
To the library.
I'll take out that book you been reading:

01:27:37.888 --> 01:27:41.016
How to Fuck Friends and Irritate People.

01:27:44.686 --> 01:27:48.690
It look like the parole board
will let me out any day now.

01:27:49.441 --> 01:27:54.096
Then we'll have a celebration...
all up and down Lenox Avenue.

01:27:54.196 --> 01:27:58.433
You'll be happy to know that the bank
is making more money now than ever.

01:27:58.533 --> 01:28:03.956
When I take possession of me bank,
you will no longer work for the Queen.

01:28:05.999 --> 01:28:10.671
- What are you talking about?
- You broke your promise. You lied!

01:28:12.631 --> 01:28:15.325
I wasn't able to keep that promise.

01:28:15.425 --> 01:28:18.370
We had to fight for the bank.
Dutch wasn't gonna let up.

01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:23.850
You villain. You are not gonna let up.
I can see that now.

01:28:24.101 --> 01:28:27.421
I've been invited to
the syndicate table by Mr Luciano.

01:28:27.521 --> 01:28:31.149
- Don't that count for nothing?
- What about life?

01:28:32.067 --> 01:28:34.903
Doesn't life count for anything?

01:28:36.446 --> 01:28:42.119
You asked me to take control
of the bank while you were gone.

01:28:42.994 --> 01:28:45.272
I did that and kept it
out of Dutch's hands.

01:28:45.372 --> 01:28:49.401
Now, you wanna come back and run it
with me, I'll welcome you with open arms.

01:28:49.501 --> 01:28:51.962
But we will do it together.

01:28:52.087 --> 01:28:55.632
So I guess you the king now, eh?

01:28:56.925 --> 01:28:59.678
Long live the king!

01:29:20.323 --> 01:29:22.517
Lovey, why aren't you dressed?

01:29:22.617 --> 01:29:27.414
I told Sam and them we'd meet them
at the Sugar Cane Club in half an hour.

01:29:28.832 --> 01:29:31.126
Bumpy, I'm leaving you.

01:29:38.633 --> 01:29:41.244
You're leaving me?

01:29:41.344 --> 01:29:42.971
Yes.

01:29:45.807 --> 01:29:48.101
Hold on a few ticks.

01:29:59.571 --> 01:30:01.948
You going? Take that with you!

01:30:04.034 --> 01:30:06.286
And that, too.

01:30:08.622 --> 01:30:11.333
I don't care about your trophies!

01:30:11.958 --> 01:30:14.820
- You don't want any?
- It was wrong for me to take 'em.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:19.241
It was, was it? You took 'em nevertheless,
didn't ya? Take it all!

01:30:19.341 --> 01:30:22.077
- I don't want any of this shit!
- Watch your language!

01:30:22.177 --> 01:30:25.914
- You go to hell!
- You're playing with fire.

01:30:26.014 --> 01:30:29.935
You and your noble ideas!
And all your promises!

01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:36.174
- You lied to me!
- You lied to yourself, Francine.

01:30:36.274 --> 01:30:40.320
When you left that stiff in the bathroom.

01:30:42.072 --> 01:30:45.308
You are just like Dutch Schultz.
You're a pig!

01:30:45.408 --> 01:30:49.329
If it wasn't for you,
Mary would still be alive!

01:30:49.454 --> 01:30:52.374
Yeah, I said it! You're a pig!

01:30:53.291 --> 01:30:56.778
You gonna hit me now? Bumpy, come on!

01:30:56.878 --> 01:30:59.172
Come on. Hit me.

01:31:11.434 --> 01:31:13.770
Why...?

01:31:13.979 --> 01:31:18.817
- Francine, you used to be...
- Well, you used to be a human being.

01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:24.280
Used to be the man I loved.

01:31:28.284 --> 01:31:30.787
Sit down.

01:31:30.954 --> 01:31:33.665
I been sitting down too long.

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:37.335
I gotta go.

01:31:39.754 --> 01:31:42.298
Yeah, well,

01:31:44.718 --> 01:31:47.429
don't forget your good book.

01:31:51.016 --> 01:31:54.227
You used to write me poetry, Ellsworth.

01:32:16.082 --> 01:32:18.918
Make sure nothing happens to her.

01:32:23.715 --> 01:32:26.159
I'm a police captain,
for the love of Mike!

01:32:26.259 --> 01:32:28.870
How's it gonna look
if I'm seen with a nigger?

01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:31.623
That's all the ''niggers''
I'm gonna take from you.

01:32:31.723 --> 01:32:36.144
- What did you say to me?
- That's all the ''niggers'' I'm gonna take.

01:32:36.728 --> 01:32:41.508
That's one more than I'll take!
I don't ride with niggers in my car!

01:32:41.608 --> 01:32:44.319
Enough of this shit!

01:32:47.238 --> 01:32:49.324
Hewlett, sit down.

01:32:53.828 --> 01:32:55.605
- Jack.
- Yes?

01:32:55.705 --> 01:33:00.752
We go back 15 years, but I'll cut
your head off and drop it in the river.

01:33:01.044 --> 01:33:04.422
- What are you doin' to me?
- You wanna test me?

01:33:04.881 --> 01:33:07.742
Hewlett, I own you. You do as I tell you.

01:33:07.842 --> 01:33:13.473
Put aside your differences for the time
being. We got a job to do. Shake hands.

01:33:16.976 --> 01:33:19.270
Shake hands.

01:33:21.105 --> 01:33:24.859
That's very nice. A truce.
Fuckin' beautiful.

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.929
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:33:28.029 --> 01:33:31.474
Hewlett, why don't you take
some of this stuff home with ya?

01:33:31.574 --> 01:33:34.118
Me and Foley didn't even finish
the sandwiches.

01:33:34.244 --> 01:33:38.606
- No, Dutch. It ain't necessary.
- It'll go in the garbage otherwise.

01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:41.609
You got all them grandkids to feed.

01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:44.003
It ain't necessary.

01:33:45.630 --> 01:33:48.341
Don't be proud.

01:33:48.716 --> 01:33:51.886
Wrap up the scraps and take 'em home.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.652
Thank you, Dutch.

01:34:24.752 --> 01:34:26.963
It ain't nothin'.

01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:36.664
- Leave me alone. Let me be.
- Here, here. Take it easy.

01:34:36.764 --> 01:34:39.475
Can't you see we tryin' to play a game?

01:34:40.893 --> 01:34:43.396
It be OK.

01:34:44.397 --> 01:34:46.315
I see.

01:34:47.525 --> 01:34:50.069
You wanna know what I see?

01:34:52.655 --> 01:34:56.267
I done seen more people die
in the last six months

01:34:56.367 --> 01:34:59.078
than I have in my whole life.

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:04.108
Now, you leave me alone and let me
go play my song for Miss Mary.

01:35:04.208 --> 01:35:07.654
- I understand you upset about Pigfoot.
- Mary!

01:35:07.754 --> 01:35:12.951
That's her name! And you don't give
a good goddamn about her, no way.

01:35:13.051 --> 01:35:16.245
You couldn't even come
to the goddamn funeral!

01:35:16.345 --> 01:35:20.266
- I paid my respects.
- Fuckass flowers don't mean a thing!

01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:24.295
They don't mean shit! You should've
brought your black ass over there.

01:35:24.395 --> 01:35:30.009
Me going to church and you carrying on
ain't gonna bring Mary back, is it?

01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:31.944
Let me ask you something.

01:35:32.195 --> 01:35:35.431
How many of the general's
foot soldiers got to die

01:35:35.531 --> 01:35:41.204
before you see that they playin' you just
like I'm playin' that raggedy-ass piano?

01:35:42.914 --> 01:35:45.566
Dutch got niggers working for him.

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:49.170
We kill them, and it all work out

01:35:50.254 --> 01:35:53.549
so we all just killin' each other.

01:35:56.636 --> 01:36:00.790
Any nigger fool enough to work
for the Dutchman deserve to die.

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:03.167
How you sound!

01:36:03.267 --> 01:36:06.521
You think innocent people deserve to die?

01:36:07.647 --> 01:36:10.091
Tyrone?

01:36:10.191 --> 01:36:11.734
My Mary?

01:36:13.819 --> 01:36:17.573
You there like you ain't got
nothing to say to me.

01:36:20.117 --> 01:36:25.248
Let's see what Mr Speaker got to say.
He always got a word for ya.

01:36:25.873 --> 01:36:29.193
- Illy.
- Come on! Give it to me! Huh?

01:36:29.293 --> 01:36:33.448
- Take it easy, man!
- It's all right. Turn him loose.

01:36:33.548 --> 01:36:37.093
I wish I never gave you
that motherfuckin' gun!

01:36:37.927 --> 01:36:40.830
Ooh, I'm sorry! I shouldn't have cussed!

01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:44.417
You need to go home.
You drunk on that King Kong.

01:36:44.517 --> 01:36:50.006
- You drunk on yourself.
- Illinois, don't let me raise up

01:36:50.106 --> 01:36:53.776
and come over there
and put my hands on you, hear?

01:36:54.652 --> 01:36:57.530
That's how you talk to me now? Huh?

01:36:59.615 --> 01:37:01.684
- You talking to me...
- I done told you!

01:37:01.784 --> 01:37:04.912
Take yo' drunk ass home!

01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:11.335
All right, then.

01:37:12.461 --> 01:37:14.755
I'm gonna do what you say.

01:37:15.673 --> 01:37:21.512
No! Illinois a good soldier!
Always do what General Bumpy say!

01:37:25.308 --> 01:37:27.376
But let me put this on your mind.

01:37:27.476 --> 01:37:33.107
You smoke this over when you're going
down your list of accomplishments.

01:37:36.485 --> 01:37:41.073
Harlem used to be still
and silent at night.

01:37:43.868 --> 01:37:47.788
You can thank yourself
for the way it is now.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.108
I'm through, cousin.

01:37:51.208 --> 01:37:55.129
You can fight this war
by your goddamn self now!

01:37:55.254 --> 01:37:57.740
I'm through.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:03.471
I'm like Jack the Bear's brother.
I can't go no further.

01:38:05.306 --> 01:38:09.060
See? Good. Now you got two guns.

01:38:14.857 --> 01:38:17.468
I'm gonna hold onto this for you, Bear.

01:38:17.568 --> 01:38:21.722
Come on. Tell me a joke.

01:38:21.822 --> 01:38:26.619
Come on, Illy. Tell Whispers a joke.

01:38:28.245 --> 01:38:30.706
We the joke, Whispers.

01:38:31.874 --> 01:38:34.585
You don't hear Dutch laughin'?

01:38:52.728 --> 01:38:55.005
Tiny!

01:38:55.105 --> 01:38:57.817
Tiny, let's have a talk.

01:38:59.443 --> 01:39:03.364
- Come on over.
- Officer Foley!

01:39:07.076 --> 01:39:09.770
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:12.982
I don't think you should do that, Tiny.

01:39:13.082 --> 01:39:17.862
You're right. You the law!
I've been looking for you.

01:39:17.962 --> 01:39:20.172
See how lucky you are? Here I am.

01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:23.551
I got some good news for you.

01:39:24.718 --> 01:39:28.456
You, too. I just want you to know

01:39:28.556 --> 01:39:34.670
that from now on you won't have
no more trouble out of Illinois Gordon!

01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:40.192
That's right.
I wash my hands. I'm through.

01:39:42.695 --> 01:39:46.031
- I'm out.
- Do you have trouble learning, son?

01:39:46.865 --> 01:39:48.726
No, sir.

01:39:48.826 --> 01:39:52.521
They should've taught you
a long time ago that once you're in,

01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:54.899
you can't get out.

01:39:54.999 --> 01:39:57.293
They should've.

01:39:59.003 --> 01:40:01.071
- Get your ass in!
- I'm sorry!

01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:03.465
Get your ass in!

01:40:10.639 --> 01:40:14.084
You're making it
awfully hard on yourself, son.

01:40:14.184 --> 01:40:16.645
So I'll ask you again.

01:40:18.105 --> 01:40:21.025
Where do you hide the policy slips?

01:40:24.403 --> 01:40:26.947
- Would you like to have a go?
- That's you.

01:40:27.072 --> 01:40:29.725
It is me, isn't it?

01:40:29.825 --> 01:40:31.702
That it is.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.861
I see why Bumpy don't go to church, Bub.

01:40:40.961 --> 01:40:43.322
What?

01:40:43.422 --> 01:40:45.616
Kill

01:40:45.716 --> 01:40:49.411
or be... or be killed.

01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:54.892
Jesus Christ, Foley.
He ain't gonna talk. Let him go.

01:40:55.309 --> 01:40:58.003
Oh, yes, he is.

01:40:58.103 --> 01:41:00.397
He's gonna talk!

01:41:01.899 --> 01:41:04.276
Sure you don't want to have a go?

01:41:04.401 --> 01:41:09.156
- I'm going.
- Suit yourself.

01:41:09.948 --> 01:41:16.622
Now, we both know
you're gonna talk, don't we?

01:41:17.247 --> 01:41:20.776
Cos I will ram this corkscrew
up your nostrils

01:41:20.876 --> 01:41:22.961
till I pop your eyeballs out.

01:41:23.253 --> 01:41:26.173
And you know I'll do it, don't you?

01:41:27.299 --> 01:41:30.786
OK, OK.

01:41:30.886 --> 01:41:32.746
OK!

01:41:32.846 --> 01:41:36.391
You have something to tell me, then, huh?

01:41:37.434 --> 01:41:40.145
All right. What is it?

01:41:44.066 --> 01:41:46.552
What? What? I can't hear you.

01:41:46.652 --> 01:41:54.143
My cousin is gonna fuck you up
real bad behind this,

01:41:54.243 --> 01:41:58.622
Officer Foley!

01:42:02.125 --> 01:42:07.156
The dividing line could conceivably
be 135th Street running east to west

01:42:07.256 --> 01:42:10.784
and Lenox Avenue running north to south.

01:42:10.884 --> 01:42:13.787
Mr Schultz would take one territory

01:42:13.887 --> 01:42:16.890
and Mr Johnson the other.

01:42:19.726 --> 01:42:24.715
I can't accept any proposal that allows
Mr Schultz to operate freely in Harlem.

01:42:24.815 --> 01:42:29.052
As I said before, I have no quarrel
with any of you gentlemen.

01:42:29.152 --> 01:42:33.073
But if Mr Schultz
insists on coming uptown,

01:42:33.198 --> 01:42:37.452
I have no choice but to make
my presence felt downtown.

01:42:39.079 --> 01:42:41.982
Such a course of action
will bring about your demise.

01:42:42.082 --> 01:42:46.587
Dutch been tryin' to bring about
my demise for quite some time.

01:42:47.379 --> 01:42:50.507
- I'm not Dutch.
- Yeah, you Lucky.

01:42:53.176 --> 01:42:58.724
- You got nuts the size of watermelons.
- Dutch, enough with the compliments.

01:43:01.226 --> 01:43:04.546
Perhaps you gentlemen need more time
to consider my proposal.

01:43:04.646 --> 01:43:07.899
We ain't gotta consider a fuckin' thing!

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.137
Your days are numbered,
if you'll pardon the expression.

01:43:12.237 --> 01:43:15.807
- You're pretty smart for a nigger.
- Yeah, so are you.

01:43:15.907 --> 01:43:20.479
Well, that's good. Insult the man who
holds your destiny between his fingers.

01:43:20.579 --> 01:43:24.983
So you got some slips.
I'll beat the rap hands down.

01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:27.794
Oh! Like the glorious
Madam Queen of Policy?

01:43:30.339 --> 01:43:33.825
My judge is sending your black ass
to fuckin' jail!

01:43:33.925 --> 01:43:36.428
Jesus Christ!

01:43:42.517 --> 01:43:43.961
Your move.

01:43:44.061 --> 01:43:46.129
- Bump?
- Yeah?

01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:51.718
Illinois was the only one besides you who
knew where them slips was hidden, man.

01:43:51.818 --> 01:43:55.155
That don't make him
a stool pigeon, Calvin.

01:44:11.755 --> 01:44:13.840
- Bumpy...
- Yeah?

01:44:14.758 --> 01:44:17.052
We found him.

01:45:02.514 --> 01:45:07.169
That old brick-presser over there
said he saw a cop string him up.

01:45:07.269 --> 01:45:10.230
The cop had captain's bars.

01:45:49.185 --> 01:45:52.506
Kiss it again! Oh, yeah!

01:45:52.606 --> 01:45:55.859
Oh, God, I love you, girl. Oh, yes!

01:45:56.818 --> 01:46:00.989
- Aye, you do that so good!
- Thank you, Billy.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:08.288
Hey, what did you put it away for?

01:46:10.582 --> 01:46:13.293
What are you doing? You can't stop...

01:46:19.841 --> 01:46:25.055
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Wait, wait.
Let me finish putting my pants on.

01:47:04.844 --> 01:47:07.097
Hey, Bub.

01:47:09.557 --> 01:47:11.376
- You touch Illinois?
- No.

01:47:11.476 --> 01:47:13.670
Did you put your hands on my family?

01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:16.881
- I said, fuck no!
- You didn't do nothing to stop it.

01:47:16.981 --> 01:47:21.027
If there's blood on my hands,
there's blood on yours, too.

01:47:21.319 --> 01:47:26.516
- You ain't no better than me.
- How you sleep at night, old man?

01:47:26.616 --> 01:47:29.744
How the fuck do you know I sleep at all?

01:47:33.123 --> 01:47:35.417
You owe me.

01:47:38.128 --> 01:47:41.464
You ain't no better than me!
You ain't no better than me.

01:48:45.445 --> 01:48:49.574
- Sit down.
- Your man said you had a proposal.

01:48:50.033 --> 01:48:54.621
If the Dutchman wins,
everybody in Harlem loses,

01:48:55.371 --> 01:48:58.207
including you and me.

01:49:15.683 --> 01:49:17.769
Go on.

01:49:21.981 --> 01:49:24.275
Smoke this over.

01:49:25.026 --> 01:49:28.847
When I went in the joint,
you ran the fiercest gang in Harlem.

01:49:28.947 --> 01:49:31.099
I come out, you workin' for the Dutchman.

01:49:31.199 --> 01:49:35.895
With everything that's been goin' on
for the last year and a half, I start thinkin'.

01:49:35.995 --> 01:49:40.608
How'd the Dutchman get so high up
on the ladder? Cos of you.

01:49:40.708 --> 01:49:43.378
How come the Queen's still got her bank?

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:14.017
- Why the change of heart?
- The Dutchman's got me boxed in.

01:50:14.117 --> 01:50:18.896
And I need your connections so I don't
take the fall for those policy slips.

01:50:18.996 --> 01:50:22.609
Besides, a coloured man don't stand
much of a chance buying Tom Dewey.

01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:26.713
Tom Dewey would take a payment
from an aardvark.

01:50:28.172 --> 01:50:30.992
I could also use your muscle
to keep Dutch off my back.

01:50:31.092 --> 01:50:36.931
You know the terms of a partnership now,
at this juncture, would be quite severe?

01:50:39.016 --> 01:50:42.628
A wise man once told me, Mr Luciano,

01:50:42.728 --> 01:50:46.424
that if a man wants to succeed
in this business,

01:50:46.524 --> 01:50:49.427
he has to make alliances.

01:50:49.527 --> 01:50:51.387
Nice.

01:50:51.487 --> 01:50:54.474
Should I drive around the yard
once again, Mr Luciano?

01:50:54.574 --> 01:50:57.201
One more time, Cecil.

01:50:59.328 --> 01:51:01.689
How can I get assurances
you'll play square?

01:51:01.789 --> 01:51:04.734
Have your accountant
come by my controller's house.

01:51:04.834 --> 01:51:08.571
Say around three o'clock.
I'll let him go over the books.

01:51:08.671 --> 01:51:11.674
The runners, routes, slips, everything.

01:51:13.468 --> 01:51:19.807
You know, a funny thing about Dutch.
He's worth $3 million. Easy.

01:51:23.102 --> 01:51:27.131
You'd think a guy makin' that kind of
dough would make himself look proper.

01:51:27.231 --> 01:51:29.942
Nice clothes, good haircut.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.181
Instead, he looks like a vagrant
half the times.

01:51:35.281 --> 01:51:38.618
He buys his suits off the rack
at Wanamaker's.

01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:42.163
If you don't know, you don't know.

01:51:42.788 --> 01:51:46.334
- Do you know, Mr Johnson?
- I believe I do.

01:51:51.005 --> 01:51:53.299
Then what happened?

01:51:54.383 --> 01:51:57.829
Mr Luciano...
he don't think I be listening.

01:51:57.929 --> 01:52:00.623
But I be hearing
every word they be saying,

01:52:00.723 --> 01:52:04.977
on account I got the partition...
it's cracked.

01:52:05.436 --> 01:52:07.505
Go on.

01:52:07.605 --> 01:52:13.094
Bumpy Johnson say he need a partner
to help him beat you for the numbers.

01:52:13.194 --> 01:52:14.303
And?

01:52:14.403 --> 01:52:17.431
Bumpy Johnson asked Mr Luciano
to have Mr Johnny,

01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:21.310
the fella that's good with figures,
to meet him this afternoon

01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:23.871
so he can go over his books.

01:52:27.917 --> 01:52:31.796
- Take the yard.
- Yes, sir.

01:52:32.588 --> 01:52:34.882
Thank you, Mr Schultz.

01:52:35.508 --> 01:52:38.494
If you're right, there's more
where that come from.

01:52:38.594 --> 01:52:41.097
You won't say anything
to Mr Luciano, will ya?

01:52:41.472 --> 01:52:45.209
- My lips are sealed.
- Thank you, sir.

01:52:45.309 --> 01:52:46.836
- Cecil.
- Yes, sir?

01:52:46.936 --> 01:52:49.480
If you're lying,
you know what I'll do to you.

01:52:49.855 --> 01:52:53.234
- Yes, sir. I know.
- So long as you know.

01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:57.238
Yes, sir. Everybody know.

01:53:00.908 --> 01:53:06.022
Don't that just figure?
A coloured and a dago partnered up!

01:53:06.122 --> 01:53:10.901
Sicilians, they're nearly niggers anyways.

01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:14.630
They're dark-complected bastards.

01:53:15.339 --> 01:53:20.119
Takin' on Lucky, we're gonna
be in a whole lotta shit.

01:53:20.219 --> 01:53:23.973
- What's up, Bub?
- Nothin'.

01:53:24.265 --> 01:53:26.542
You goin' soft?

01:53:26.642 --> 01:53:30.146
I'm behind you, Dutch. A hundred percent.

01:53:39.447 --> 01:53:42.575
Good work, Cecil. Present from Bumpy.

01:53:51.876 --> 01:53:54.587
- Here we go.
- Hold it.

01:53:56.130 --> 01:53:57.673
We can wait.

01:54:21.655 --> 01:54:23.032
There's Figures. Let's go.

01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:30.164
- Hey, Johnny. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Dutch. How are...

01:54:31.415 --> 01:54:33.542
Little prick!

01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:42.259
Vince, go back down and watch the door.

01:54:46.639 --> 01:54:50.267
- Is this it?
- Please, please...! Yes!

01:55:32.476 --> 01:55:35.562
- Where is he?
- I don't know, Dutch.

01:55:47.408 --> 01:55:50.269
What's 235?

01:55:50.369 --> 01:55:52.663
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:55:53.747 --> 01:55:56.275
235.

01:55:56.375 --> 01:55:58.961
It means death.

01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:04.450
Please, Dutch. I'm only an accountant.

01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:08.262
- You let me live, I'll make sure...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:56:16.937 --> 01:56:18.797
What's our next move?

01:56:18.897 --> 01:56:22.443
I got a surprise
for little Arthur Flegenheimer.

01:56:28.615 --> 01:56:30.701
Let's go!

01:56:37.082 --> 01:56:39.168
Dewey's office. This way.

01:56:42.004 --> 01:56:44.089
Quickly.

01:57:05.319 --> 01:57:08.639
- Where's Hewlett?
- Still looking for Bumpy Johnson.

01:57:08.739 --> 01:57:11.074
He wanted that 4,000 you promised.

01:57:13.952 --> 01:57:17.898
You know,
it just doesn't make sense to me.

01:57:17.998 --> 01:57:22.361
I don't ever see that jigaboo
making a deal with a white guy.

01:57:22.461 --> 01:57:25.406
I mean, even if he's a Sicilian.

01:57:25.506 --> 01:57:29.076
Yeah, well, Lulu,
that's cos you're a fuckin' idiot.

01:57:29.176 --> 01:57:34.164
He never had no intention.
He set me up for a war with Luciano.

01:57:34.264 --> 01:57:38.127
- That's pretty smart for a nigger.
- Yeah!

01:57:38.227 --> 01:57:40.337
If Luciano wants a fuckin' war,

01:57:40.437 --> 01:57:43.966
I'll splatter this fuckin' city
with his blood.

01:57:44.066 --> 01:57:47.194
- I'm gonna take a piss.
- OK, Dutch.

01:58:09.424 --> 01:58:12.803
What do you want? I'm fuckin' busy here.

01:58:17.474 --> 01:58:20.811
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me!
They send you.

01:59:32.090 --> 01:59:34.801
It's done.

01:59:35.093 --> 01:59:37.804
Where's the money?

01:59:59.242 --> 02:00:02.979
- Hello.
- I wanna tell you this myself.

02:00:03.079 --> 02:00:06.692
Bumpy Johnson just made me
a very wealthy man.

02:00:06.792 --> 02:00:10.712
He took care of the Dutch Schultz
problem, and he used you to do it.

02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:14.366
Not that you would have occasion to,

02:00:14.466 --> 02:00:18.178
but, if I were you, Lucky,
I'd never go to Harlem.

02:01:02.764 --> 02:01:05.625
The Dutchman's dead.

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:09.463
- Did Thomas Dewey get his money?
- Yes.

02:01:09.563 --> 02:01:13.191
- Cecil get his cut?
- Yes.

02:01:14.359 --> 02:01:17.012
Looks like the Queen has the bank back.

02:01:17.112 --> 02:01:21.366
- That's the way it's supposed to be.
- What you gonna do, Bumpy?

02:01:22.993 --> 02:01:27.606
I got some unfinished business
to take care of. What about you?

02:01:27.706 --> 02:01:30.083
I'm gonna get some sleep.

02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:33.295
Thanks.

02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:23.328
..how sweet the sound

02:02:23.428 --> 02:02:31.544
That saved a wretch

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:38.902
Like me

02:02:39.861 --> 02:02:48.144
I once was lost

02:02:48.244 --> 02:02:56.027
But now I'm found

02:02:56.127 --> 02:03:00.156
Was blind

02:03:00.256 --> 02:03:09.641
But now I see

02:03:10.305 --> 02:03:16.610
