WEBVTT

00:31.031 --> 00:32.987
Take the weapon, Daniel.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.489
Did you hear that?

00:40.665 --> 00:43.122
- What's going on?
- Don't talk. Get your shoes.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.758
Please, stop. You're hurting me.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.336
- There's no time.
- Plea--

00:57.515 --> 00:59.471
You need to keep up.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.392
I can't.
I can't.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.844
What is the matter with you?

01:03.938 --> 01:06.395
I don't know. I don't feel good.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.973
Let me see you.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.319
Is it bad?

01:35.678 --> 01:38.590
Where are your words now?

01:38.681 --> 01:41.093
What can you tell him?

01:41.142 --> 01:43.428
-This man who loved you...
- Travis.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.511
...who died believing your lies.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.557
...who died believing your lies.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.559
You tell him the truth.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.686
That you looked inside yourself,

01:50.777 --> 01:52.893
deep into the place where
your soul should be

01:52.987 --> 01:54.898
and you found it empty.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.820
You tell him that!

01:58.409 --> 02:00.400
You love no one!
You believe in nothing.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.610
No, that's enough.
That's enough.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.696
Why are you here? Who are you?

02:04.707 --> 02:06.117
Why are you here? Who are you?

02:06.167 --> 02:08.499
His friend.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.788
You are his fool.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.090
So was my son.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.962
Celia, I'm so sorry.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.933
- Ofelia.
-Papa?

02:25.019 --> 02:27.476
- Ofelia.
- What's wrong?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.725
I'm here.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.352
Are you okay?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.233
Yeah.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.187
Thank god.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.449
Have you seen Chris?
I can't find him.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.325
Help me look for him. I'm
gonna check outside.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.577
- Can you just--
- No.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.786
Travis, he had a knife.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.459
The shot went off,
he was in our room

02:51.546 --> 02:53.002
standing over me with a knife.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.421
Stop. He would never hurt you.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.717
Do you think I'm lying?

03:01.097 --> 03:02.962
I have to bury him.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.343
You don't deserve to bury him.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.304
It's what he wanted.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.344
What he wanted?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.515
What he wanted?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.598
What he wanted was
what you promised.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.395
What he wanted was
what you promised.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.435
This man, my
beautiful, stupid son,

03:16.446 --> 03:18.607
This man, my
beautiful, stupid son,

03:18.698 --> 03:21.280
wanted you!

03:21.326 --> 03:23.191
He is not your son.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.490
Celia, hey, he didn't mean that.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.162
- He didn't mean that.
- Stay out of it.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.199
They need some time. Please.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.746
They need some time. Please.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.293
You're going to let this
boy do your begging?

03:42.096 --> 03:44.052
Fine.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.092
Now Thomas can get everything
you have to offer.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.559
Now Thomas can get everything
you have to offer.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.638
An empty hole, some dirt.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.105
An empty hole, some dirt.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.808
You have one day.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.894
The sun comes down,
I want you gone.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.111
The sun comes down,
I want you gone.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.738
All of you.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.682
Chris!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.190
Chris!

06:58.876 --> 07:01.788
Pack whatever supplies we
can carry-- food, water,

07:01.879 --> 07:04.495
anything you can get your hands on
without drawing attention to yourself.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.961
And we need the truck to
get back to the boat.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.427
Did you see where
he put the keys?

07:08.469 --> 07:09.584
I'm not going back to the boat.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.502
Alicia, we don't have a choice.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.389
That sun sets, they'll
force us off the land.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.766
- Mom-- - These people
are not our friends.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.595
Get it through your heads.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.638
Both of you. This
place is dangerous.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.810
Both of you. This
place is dangerous.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.687
That woman is dangerous.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.523
She's just upset. I
can talk to her.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.564
You stay away from Celia.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.906
You stay away from Celia.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.819
Do you hear me?

07:35.913 --> 07:37.949
Travis is coming over that hill.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.576
When he does, that's
when we move.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.035
What if he doesn't?

07:43.045 --> 07:44.876
He is coming back.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.572
- Get out of my house!
- I'm looking for my son.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.698
- Get out of my house!
- I'm looking for my son.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.582
- Get out!
- Easy, easy.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.207
Okay.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.973
Myba.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.891
Please.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.031
Water.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.983
Thank you.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.707
My son.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.254
I'm looking for my son.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.547
I don 't understand.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.628
I'm sorry.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.509
It's my feet.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.402
- Thanks.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.613
Oh, my God.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.019
Nick.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.364
What do you see?

11:05.539 --> 11:08.030
Look at him.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.535
Is this death?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.835
What you see is my son.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.839
Changed, yes, but
no less my son.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.170
My Luis.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.466
Who you brought back to me.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.675
Take him to the others.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.806
Watch him careful/y.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.812
Or are afraid to.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.405
You are not.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.081
VVhy?

11:48.165 --> 11:50.121
I don't know.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.372
You belong here
with us, Nicholas.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.374
With me.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.797
-Smy
- What about my family?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.923
You want to do the right thing.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.682
But they are not like you.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.719
Celia, they are not bad people.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.436
Celia, they are not bad people.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.514
And when they look upon
my son, what do they see?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.231
And when they look upon
my son, what do they see?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.352
Go on, say it.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.611
A monster.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.784
Is that what we call
these creatures

12:27.830 --> 12:30.697
who can't control their
nature, their hunger?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.741
And what do we call
those who destroy them?

12:32.752 --> 12:33.992
And what do we call
those who destroy them?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.171
The ones who kill
without thinking.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.462
Which is the monster?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.915
They will learn.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.168
My family won 't hurt anyone.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.969
They will be safe here.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.721
You can't change them.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.849
Please.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.223
You will be responsible for their
actions while they are here.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.650
- Yes.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.650
Tell your family they
are welcome to stay.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.448
But not Victor Strand.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.787
He doesn't belong here.
He never did.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.118
This is not apocalypse.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.328
This is our beginning, Nicholas.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.670
This is our beginning, Nicholas.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.748
The end of death itself.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.044
The end of death itself.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.084
Life eternal.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.380
Life eternal.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.140
Don't do this.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.097
Don't put him in the ground.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.475
What?

13:41.570 --> 13:43.777
This place is unholy.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.439
It's infected.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.401
Even the dirt.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.861
The walls in this place.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.747
That woman, her dead.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.247
Hey.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.416
Your friend, he won't rest.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.842
He'll come back for you.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.388
You don't believe?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.428
lfl did, I'd be
with him right now.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.684
He will return.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.393
They return, but
they're not the same.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.564
They return, but
they're not the same.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.442
You're not the same.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.320
And they hate you for it.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.409
What's wrong with you?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.616
Don't put him in the ground.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.894
Brought you these.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.187
No Travis yet?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.230
He'll be back soon. Don't worry.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.774
I worry.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.397
I know.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.146
You're different.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.910
Ever since we left LA.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.159
l was different before that.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.819
You know what I mean.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.699
I don't understand this fascination
that you have with them.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.950
I don't understand this fascination
that you have with them.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.994
- With the dead.
- They're not dead.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.085
- With the dead.
- They're not dead.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.873
- Fine, infected.
- They're not infected.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.712
- The word doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter to you.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.214
- What do you want me to call them?
- Their names.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.715
What is going on with you?

15:32.806 --> 15:34.762
The day you were
swarmed at the beach,

15:34.850 --> 15:36.841
you come back all covered
in God knows what.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.388
you come back all covered
in God knows what.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.640
You don't change.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.346
And then you go
ashore at the border.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.352
You're alone for hours there.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.149
Are you listening to yourself?

15:46.195 --> 15:48.106
Then you do this.
You risk your life

15:48.155 --> 15:50.066
just to bring that thing back.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.073
You're talking like
I'm using again.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.825
Is it Celia? Did she
put you up to it?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.120
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.156
Like what? I'm trying
to understand.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.452
Like what? I'm trying
to understand.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.330
She wanted her son back.
You can understand that!

16:05.798 --> 16:07.663
Right?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.589
So that's what I did, Mom.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.087
| just brought him back.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.512
And now we get to stay.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.590
You know, I'd do
the same for you.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.392
What?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.435
I can bring Travis back.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.514
- No.
- Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.640
- No.
- Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.191
- You don't know that.
- I do.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.228
When I was on the beach, I came
face-to-face with one of them

16:30.239 --> 16:32.480
When I was on the beach, I came
face-to-face with one of them

16:32.574 --> 16:34.565
and I didn't feel fear,
I didn't feel hate.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.237
and I didn't feel fear,
I didn't feel hate.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.277
| just knew I wasn't
going to die.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.619
| just knew I wasn't
going to die.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.698
Not there, not that way.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.949
Not there, not that way.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.335
I move among them, Mom.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.629
Invisible.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.095
lwill not die.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.894
- Ofelia. Ofelia.
- Yes?

17:07.985 --> 17:10.146
Come with me.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.572
Keep your eyes down. Don't talk.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.647
- Why?
- She's waiting for us.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.698
- Who is?
- Your mother.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.777
She's at the gate.
She's outside.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.079
- Papa, it's going to be okay.
- What are you doing?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.115
Did you hear what I said?
This place is evil!

17:24.126 --> 17:25.241
Did you hear what I said?
This place is evil!

17:25.294 --> 17:28.161
- If we stay, we die.
- We have no place to go, Papa.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.204
- Let me go!
- Take her away!

17:30.215 --> 17:31.796
- Let me go!
- Take her away!

17:31.884 --> 17:32.623
Easy!

17:32.843 --> 17:35.380
Easy! That's enough!

17:40.768 --> 17:42.599
Wait! Papal

17:42.686 --> 17:44.426
Okay, don't move. Hold still.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.032
I know what you're
going through.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.492
I know what he meant to you.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.198
What is it that you want?

18:06.251 --> 18:08.333
Nick.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.539
- He's just--
- I'm not the boy's daddy.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.088
| just thought that-- I don't
know what's happening to him.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.669
Yes, you do.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.376
You take a vulnerable
kid, an addict,

18:17.471 --> 18:20.383
drop him in a mess
of death and doubt,

18:20.432 --> 18:22.423
it won't be long before he starts
looking for something to cling to.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.140
it won't be long before he starts
looking for something to cling to.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.302
In comes Mama Celia

18:26.355 --> 18:28.346
with her authentic
Mexican cuisine,

18:28.357 --> 18:29.392
with her authentic
Mexican cuisine,

18:29.441 --> 18:31.432
side of quasi-religious
voodoo bullshit and voila.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.434
side of quasi-religious
voodoo bullshit and voila.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.447
You bet your ass she's
got her hooks in him.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.369
This isn't how I
imagined us parting.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.755
Where will you go?

18:57.594 --> 19:00.301
Back to the boat. Ha.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.962
If there is a boat.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.815
You interested?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.398
I can't leave without Travis.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.737
You should stay, take
care of your own.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.123
| wish there was
something I could do.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.458
Look at you.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.543
Getting all sentimental.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.964
Getting all sentimental.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.546
We were the means to
each other's end.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.472
We helped each other get here.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.300
It was a useful arrangement.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.344
Let's not go confusing things
with vague terms like friend.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.732
Let's not go confusing things
with vague terms like friend.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.645
Take this and go, please.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.862
Take this and go, please.

20:03.911 --> 20:04.900
Thanks.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.501
Your son? Is that your son?

20:14.588 --> 20:16.499
Ramon.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.504
I'm looking for my son.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.583
He's about this tall.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.334
He's about this tall.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.378
Thin. He's got black hair.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.424
Thin. He's got black hair.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.173
Have you seen him?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.311
He went this way.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.558
To the east.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.896
Este? East? So he went that way?

20:44.826 --> 20:46.532
Do you really don 't understand me?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.659
He went in this direction.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.082
If you hurry you'll catch up with him.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.718
Somebody in there?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.422
Please.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.466
He says he will hurt my boy
if I don't make you leave.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.513
He says he will hurt my boy
if I don't make you leave.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.725
Okay.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.937
Why can't you just let me go?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.195
We worked 40 years for the Abigails.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.742
We worked 40 years for the Abigails.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.949
We cooked for them
and changed their bedclothes.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.951
We cooked for them
and changed their bedclothes.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.161
/ raised her son
as if I'd gave birth to him myself.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.299
/ raised her son
as if I'd gave birth to him myself

21:42.634 --> 21:44.625
Thomas was my son,
without any doubt.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.922
Thomas was my son,
without any doubt.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.929
Today / lay my son to rest.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.641
I'm not a housekeeper anymore.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.639
We all start a new life.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.688
The sins we committed,

21:59.484 --> 22:01.645
the lies we told,

22:01.862 --> 22:04.695
the hearts that we betrayed...

22:05.615 --> 22:07.355
That's all forgotten now.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.407
The world was reborn.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.944
Now our work starts,

22:11.955 --> 22:13.695
Now our work starts,

22:13.915 --> 22:15.906
in remembrance of him.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.168
in remembrance of him.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.429
We're just going to let
them throw him out?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.215
Alone?

22:34.978 --> 22:36.969
What do you want me to do?

22:44.946 --> 22:46.937
It's time for you to leave.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.818
I'm not done.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.113
It's time for you to leave.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.370
Help him.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.540
I won't have violence here.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.623
Let him punish himself.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.334
You should hurry.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.625
It's a long way
back in the dark.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.183
Where's my father?

23:21.274 --> 23:23.526
He is safe. Resting now.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.559
- I want to see him.
- I can't allow that.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.776
- I want to see him.
- I can't allow that.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.195
- The man he out almost lost his eye.
- That wasn't his fault.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.068
He's a danger to
himself, Ofelia.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.150
He's a danger to you.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.367
He's a danger to you.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.495
How long has he been unwell?

23:38.959 --> 23:41.416
I can't help him if
you don't talk to me.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.709
- He's not a bad man.
- Of course not.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.143
Everything will be fine. Don 't move.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.974
I've seen the way
they look at me.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.731
Like I'm disgusting.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.687
Like I'm a monster.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.277
You're not a monster.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.029
You sure about that?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.031
Look at the boy, Chris.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.329
He '8 scared.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.040
Chris!

24:27.632 --> 24:29.213
Chris!

24:32.554 --> 24:34.761
Chris! Chris.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.681
Go ahead! Come on! Come on!

24:54.117 --> 24:56.278
I should have helped you.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.994
Look at me.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.999
I'm no good.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.457
I'm no good.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.800
You must be hungry.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.062
A ver.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.648
Vamos.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.185
You think I would
poison a good pozole?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.613
Who would do such a thing?

25:38.703 --> 25:40.785
I am not the killer here.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.035
| see the way you look at me.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.120
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say that's hatred in your eyes.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.291
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say that's hatred in your eyes.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.795
But I am old enough to
know fear when | see it.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.334
Me, too.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.755
I'm not afraid of you.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.557
Not of me.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.887
You're afraid of the dead.

26:07.357 --> 26:10.224
Those creatures you keep,

26:10.318 --> 26:12.855
they are an abomination,

26:12.946 --> 26:15.608
an act against God.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.319
It's not my dead you fear, viejo.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.116
It is your own.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.739
Look at me, Daniel.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.289
How many?

26:23.373 --> 26:25.489
How many?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.995
Too many.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.210
During the nights...

26:31.840 --> 26:33.671
you called their names.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.545
The names of those
who had names and that you knew.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.339
They haunt you.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.422
They hate you for your silence.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.639
They hate you for your silence.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.675
I heard your confession.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.971
I heard your confession.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.436
You were begging for forgiveness.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.724
Don 't die with a tortured soul.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.066
Don 't die with a tortured soul.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.109
Confess your sins.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.067
Ask for forgiveness.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.944
Bring your tortures to an end.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.775
And mine, too.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.571
You are dying. Can you feel it?

27:05.582 --> 27:07.197
You are dying. Can you feel it?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.829
Speak while you
still have words.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.914
All your sins.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.583
Including those
you never wanted to admit.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.665
Even towards me.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.716
l have nothing to tell you.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.135
l have nothing to say to you.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.362
I don't want you
to worry, Daniel.

27:41.117 --> 27:43.028
I will take care of you.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.412
There is a place for you here.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.154
What are you doing here?

28:25.245 --> 28:27.236
I came to bring you back.
She really needs you.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.487
I came to bring you back.
She really needs you.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.702
She's hurting.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.161
- Come on.
- So does he.

28:42.345 --> 28:44.677
N0, I didn't.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.431
And you didn't ﬁnd me.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.010
He needs his father.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.554
- Travis.
-Come on, man.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.480
I owe him that, don't I?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.394
Tell her you never saw us.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.270
Tell her you never saw us.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.404
Chris can't come back, not now.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.072
I can't come back.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.904
You're making a mistake.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.571
Happens every day.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.819
You get older, you learn
to forgive yourself.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.531
I owe him.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.328
He brought us out of hell.

29:52.415 --> 29:55.327
He got us here. I'm alive
because of Victor.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.329
My children are alive
because of Victor.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.832
He killed my son.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.464
That man killed my son.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.803
What more is there to say?

30:05.845 --> 30:07.836
I would think you of all
people would understand.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.383
I would think you of all
people would understand.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.183
What about my son?

30:14.270 --> 30:16.261
You think I am filling his
head with false faith?

30:16.272 --> 30:17.523
You think I am filling his
head with false faith?

30:17.607 --> 30:19.268
Yes.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.350
He is a remarkable soul.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.726
He is a remarkable soul.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.400
Openhearted.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.231
Fearless.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.785
The only reason you are here

30:32.831 --> 30:35.038
is because I see the
light inside him.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.495
I know how rare it is.

30:37.585 --> 30:40.076
He understands.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.120
The changed ones are
our responsibility.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.213
The changed ones are
our responsibility.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.291
He's my responsibility.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.377
If you remain here, you will have
to accept them as Nicholas does.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.970
If you remain here, you will have
to accept them as Nicholas does.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.051
As we accept them.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.092
It is a new world. I hope you
can see it with new eyes.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.593
It is a new world. I hope you
can see it with new eyes.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.895
What if! can't do that?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.931
Then your son will choose

31:00.942 --> 31:03.103
Then your son will choose

31:03.152 --> 31:05.143
between his family and the truth
that they don't want to understand.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.736
between his family and the truth
that they don't want to understand.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.401
I want to understand.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.987
I do.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.703
I need to understand.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.090
Come with me.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.512
I don 't like it here.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.894
This is a godless place.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.192
This woman will take
our daughter away from us.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.610
She's a witch.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.861
She may not come near Ofelia.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.067
What will you do?

31:54.078 --> 31:55.329
What will you do?

31:55.538 --> 31:56.368
Look at you.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.321
You're tied to a chair,

31:58.541 --> 32:01.123
and only your madness
is keeping you company.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.082
And you. [still have you.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.873
Did you miss me?

32:09.802 --> 32:11.383
With all my heart.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.930
Did you love me?

32:17.435 --> 32:18.766
Why do you ask?

32:18.978 --> 32:20.388
You know the answer.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.898
You didn't bury me, Daniel.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.777
I've been waiting,
but you didn't come.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.896
l was looking for you.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.368
But I couldn't ﬁnd you.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.905
I'm still waiting.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.783
Please forgive me, darling.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.830
You told me about your whole life.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.742
You confessed your sins to me.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.041
- And / carried this burden.
- Yes.

32:49.258 --> 32:51.044
It was like that.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.921
It is like that.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.923
/ didn't hide anything from you.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.760
I told you about
every single dead person.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.257
Real/y?

33:01.354 --> 33:03.185
What about the one
you're thinking about now?

33:19.330 --> 33:21.321
They were so many.
/ don 't know whom you mean.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.447
They were so many.
/ don 't know whom you mean.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.579
The ﬁrst one.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.752
Do you remember him?

33:29.132 --> 33:30.668
Take the weapon, Daniel.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.392
/ told you about the man.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.312
The ﬁrst victim.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.286
What they made me do...

34:06.377 --> 34:07.412
No, darling.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.459
You were the ﬁrst victim.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.943
If your child was hungry,
would you not feed him?

34:41.954 --> 34:43.455
If your child was hungry,
would you not feed him?

34:46.375 --> 34:48.502
If your child couldn't speak...

34:50.338 --> 34:52.420
would you not speak
for him anyway?

34:54.300 --> 34:57.042
Even if your child
could not love,

34:57.095 --> 34:59.211
would you not love him anyway?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.342
I would.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.847
What wouldn't you do
for your children ?

35:11.734 --> 35:13.395
Nothing.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.020
Celia sent me.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.274
I'm sure she wants more Pozole.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.375
I'll help you, old man.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.854
Hurry, darling.

36:31.063 --> 36:32.678
You know what you have to do.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.941
For Ofelia, for me
and for your peace of mind.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.977
I'm waiting for you.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.942
Free me.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.932
Don't worry about me.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.140
/ found you.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.937
I always knew it.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.696
No.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.957
Daniel!

39:44.048 --> 39:45.879
Daniel!

39:58.604 --> 39:59.844
No...

40:01.482 --> 40:03.347
I'm sorry. He's gone.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.733
He's gone. It's all gone.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.527
Get in! We need to go now.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.437
Nick and Travis are coming back.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.901
We'll be dead
before they get here.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.574
We'll find them. We'll
find them, okay?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.531
Ofelia, please. Come on.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.865
I need you in here, Ofelia.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.413

- Stay here!

40:34.515 --> 40:35.300
Madison!

40:35.391 --> 40:36.221
It's impossible!

Come on!

40:37.893 --> 40:40.305
- Thank God. Nick.
- We need to move!

40:40.396 --> 40:42.352
Nick, get in the truck!

40:44.525 --> 40:45.981
I couldn't find them.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.525
Okay.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.937
Where's Celia?

40:51.031 --> 40:53.773
Come on!

40:53.868 --> 40:56.154
Who did this?

40:56.245 --> 40:58.782
We have to go. We have to
get back in the boat, Nick.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.740
We have to get back to the boat.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.748
She was right about us.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.045
Celia.
