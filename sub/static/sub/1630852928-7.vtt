WEBVTT

00:14.597 --> 00:15.682
I love you.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.023
And you think this love is a good thing?

00:26.234 --> 00:27.068
Yes.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.991
Don't you?

00:35.994 --> 00:36.995
I'm not sure.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.915
For my love, I will give everything.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.546
Myself, my family, even my Gods.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.300
What will you do for your love?

00:53.261 --> 00:54.095
More.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.683
I would set aside my destiny for you.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.648
The promise of being King of Norway.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.696
-So, you see how dangerous we are?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.200
But it doesn't have to be.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.745
As king, I can stop the hatred.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.748
We would have an open country.

01:21.831 --> 01:26.002
Run like Kattegat, where all the faiths
can be worshipped without fear.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.798
We encourage people to look for
what we share as Vikings

01:29.881 --> 01:31.549
instead of hate our differences.

01:34.052 --> 01:34.928
"We?"

01:35.929 --> 01:36.930
Yes. "We."

01:39.849 --> 01:42.852
All that is possible with you.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.610
All that is possible.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.589


03:04.309 --> 03:05.643
Canute gone?

03:06.895 --> 03:07.979
What precipitated this?

03:08.062 --> 03:10.273
The attack on Denmark, Your Highness,

03:10.356 --> 03:12.358
by one of their enemies, the Wends.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.985
Rus group of people from the East.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.280
Well, this is good news
for me now, isn't it?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.660
I'm gonna seize this opportunity
to make some changes.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.662
He anticipated that will be your reaction

03:24.746 --> 03:27.123
and therefore before he left,
he married Emma.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.920
In the middle of the night?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.673
-That is a problem.
-Yes.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.383
But not your main problem, sire.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.929
What do you mean, not my main problem?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.016
Excuse me, what are you doing there?

03:45.099 --> 03:47.894
Your Highness,
may I introduce King Canute's father?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.438
King Sweyn Forkbeard.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.026
And you must be the Boy King.

04:03.534 --> 04:07.163
Last time I saw you, you were a child.
Do you remember?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.374
I don't.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.292
Up north?

04:12.585 --> 04:15.088
You were with your father
as he was paying tribute.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.633
I liked your father.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.010
He paid well to get rid of the Vikings.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.680
Well, if Danegeld
would get you out of England,

04:23.763 --> 04:25.932
I'd be happy to try that as well.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.687
How long do you expect King Canute
to be away, Your Highness?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.815
Well, he's at war.
Which means he'll be there

04:33.898 --> 04:36.609
as long as it takes to
secure Denmark from its enemies.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.530
And in the meantime I take it
you intend to rule in his place.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.489
I do.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.911
King Edmund, you will find
that my son and I,

04:46.995 --> 04:49.080
we approach problems very differently.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.458
He's forward-thinking, patient and fair.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.545
I'm none of those things.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.007
So, with that in mind,

05:00.383 --> 05:02.260
could you please explain to me

05:03.011 --> 05:05.305
why you think that Canute has chosen

05:06.014 --> 05:09.976
to let an insolent pup like you live?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.437
-Your Highness--
-No.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.401
Let him find his own words
to describe his value.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.905
King Canute understands
that I provide an important connection

05:22.989 --> 05:24.282
to the Saxon nobles,

05:25.408 --> 05:27.160
who are necessary for his support.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.705
No, but the nobles have already sworn
their oath to him. Correct?

05:30.788 --> 05:35.168
Yes, managing them, however,
requires a delicate touch,

05:35.835 --> 05:37.378
one which I provide.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.589
Good.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.050
Good.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.222
Because delicate…

05:50.558 --> 05:52.935
is another thing that I am not.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.336
-Here.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.769
I know this child. Kåre did this.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.440
Uppsala.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.652
Go. Now.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.828
Enter.

06:55.957 --> 06:56.958
Grandfather.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.918
Oh… Gytha.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.880
I've heard you are now a lady-in-waiting.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.133
So how is everything?

07:05.758 --> 07:07.927
-I enjoy being here very much.
-Oh.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.771
Welcome, Your Highness.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.189
-I am--
-Emma.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.151
My son's new queen.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.779
I would like to talk.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.907
-My lady.
-My lady.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.418
Are you a cook, Queen Emma?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.754
A cook? No.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.840
My mother was a cook.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.634
And a very good one too.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.138
She'd cook over a large fireplace.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.516
Many pots. Stews. Roasts. Soups.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.477
All going at the same time.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.898
Used to amaze me how she somehow managed

08:01.981 --> 08:04.650
to bring everything
to the table cooked to perfection.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.777
I don't know how she did it.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.617
My son, Canute, is not a cook either,

08:13.659 --> 08:15.036
but he thinks he is.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.206
He has pots all over his fire.

08:19.081 --> 08:23.002
Norway, Denmark, England, Iceland…

08:23.669 --> 08:25.296
His great northern empire.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.467
I'm not so sure he can manage it.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.677
Which is one of the reasons he married me.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.973
Because you can manage England?

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
Yes.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.521
I admire your confidence,
but I distrust your ability.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.067
Do you distrust my ability?
Or your son's judgment?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.320
Two good questions, Queen Emma.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.701
If I knew the answer to the first,
I wouldn't doubt the second.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.954
Then allow me to prove both.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.602
Come on.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.765
Spread out. Look for survivors.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.849
I am Ealdorman Sigeferth of Wessex,
Your Highness.

10:41.932 --> 10:45.061
Wessex is the oldest
of the Saxon bloodlines.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.564
And? Does that make Wessex special?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.901
It does indeed, sire. And does this.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.821
The House of Wessex is also exempt
from paying royal taxes.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.866
That is a binding promise
from King Æthelred to my father.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.120
And what did your father do
to procure such a generous promise,

11:04.246 --> 11:06.040
Ealdorman Sigeferth?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.960
He saved the king in battle at York, sire.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.881
-At York?
-Indeed.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.133
Against who?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.929
Against yourself, sire.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.145
Keep this safe, Sigeferth of Wessex.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.899
It's a relic of a bygone time.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.819
You'll pay your taxes like everyone else.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.947
Ealdorman Wulfhere of Sussex.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.576
Your Highness, surely you would
intercede on my behalf?

11:43.327 --> 11:47.623
You are the thread
that connects past and present

11:48.290 --> 11:51.460
and know of the deep Saxon bonds.

11:53.879 --> 11:58.467
Godwin, when I challenged
the Vikings on the bridge,

11:58.551 --> 12:02.847
do you recall the esteemed Ealdorman
from Wessex at my side?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.432
No, Your Highness.

12:05.015 --> 12:08.728
I can attest with certainty that
Ealdorman Sigeferth was not present.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.271
Your highness, I was…

12:11.564 --> 12:12.815
I was unavailable.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.027
As I am to you now.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.046
-Have you been here before?
-No.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.383
I'd only heard stories.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.953
Allfather.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.336
It must have been incredible.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.716
It saddens me to think
of all who prayed here.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.191
Who could hate something this much?

13:37.274 --> 13:38.609
They are not killing people.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.904
They're cleansing the land.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.115
Rubbing away all signs of our pagan past,

13:45.866 --> 13:47.117
like a stain.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.388
Please, no.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.515
It's all right.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.226
We won't hurt you.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.228
Come.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.983
Come. You're safe now. It's all right.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.485
Come.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.457
This is her.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.461
Do not be afraid. We are friends here.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.630
You are Freydis?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.635
Yes. How do you know my name?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.471
Their leader told us you would come.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.391
He only spared us
so we could give you his message.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.351
What message?

14:55.019 --> 14:57.980
He said that his God
has ordered him to destroy Kattegat

14:59.481 --> 15:00.900
and to kill you.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.617
All dead.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.410
Everyone.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.079
What are we waiting for?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.832
I say we ride after Kåre and make him pay!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.335
From his tracks,
he has at least a hundred horsemen.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.879
We must be smart.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.381
Go back to Kattegat
and tell Haakon what we've found.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.384
We'll take care of the dead
and follow with the survivors.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.889
We need to know where Kåre is.
I'll track him and meet you in Kattegat.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.057
I'll come with you.

15:33.140 --> 15:33.974
Be safe.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.603
We camp here tonight.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.480
Build fires for the dead.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.859
Freydis. Kåre will pay for this act.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.195
I promise you justice.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.322
I don't need your promise.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.824
I can deliver justice myself.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.292
Hyah!

16:00.793 --> 16:01.794
Come on!

16:03.671 --> 16:04.588
Hyah!

16:20.270 --> 16:21.355
Hyah!

16:34.493 --> 16:35.577
Well done.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.623
I did not anticipate
your move at the wall.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.711
You were the faster horseman,
Your Highness.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.714
You forced me to improvise.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.303
So,

16:54.096 --> 16:56.724
how do you think
we should handle the new Viking?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.892
Handle him?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.937
I take it you don't feel at home
in Forkbeard's court.

17:02.021 --> 17:06.233
It was bad enough dealing with Canute,
but his father is an abomination.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.819
I hate it.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.239
And I hate myself for being
an accomplice to this travesty.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.451
How much so?

17:18.370 --> 17:19.621
How much do you hate it?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.838
Your sentiments are not felt
in isolation, Your Highness.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.800
Are you saying there are others
who'd back our resistance?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.053
I'm saying there are those
that would back a leader

17:34.136 --> 17:35.846
who has an answer to the question.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
How much do you hate it?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.355
Your Highness, you sent for me?

17:46.523 --> 17:47.900
Godwin, I did.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.121
My son Canute told me that
you were a man to be counted on.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.332
I've tried to be, Your Highness.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.167
I haven't been here long,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.836
but it's clear to see
that my son is facing threats.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.925
They may seem small now,
but they will grow.

18:13.008 --> 18:13.842
I agree.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.679
Rulers must anticipate
threats and address them.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.354
Oh! Sigeferth of Wessex. Come.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.439
I've been thinking about your petition.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.609
Please.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.244
I cannot get your petition out of my head,

18:40.911 --> 18:43.330
and I do wish my son Canute
could have heard it,

18:43.413 --> 18:46.834
as he may have responded differently.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.004
-Do you think so?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.716
I am sometimes too anxious
to say just what's in my head.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.053
Whereas Canute is a better listener.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.723
But despite our differences,

19:01.807 --> 19:04.226
I'm sure that
both Canute and I would agree that

19:04.893 --> 19:10.566
your response
could only be regarded as an insult.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.362
Oh, no, no. No, Your Highness.
It was not an insult.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.031
I was merely appealing
to King Edmund because he--

19:22.369 --> 19:24.246
-I know why.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.582
And so would my son.

19:37.092 --> 19:41.847
As I was saying,
Canute appreciates your loyalty,

19:42.890 --> 19:46.685
but I cannot have a man
of your lowly rank work for me.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.729
Therefore…

19:51.023 --> 19:52.691
on behalf of my son,

19:53.650 --> 19:58.697
I hereby make you… Godwin, Jarl of Wessex.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.747
I've been told
it's the oldest Saxon bloodline.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.821
Are you sure you trust these people?

20:40.447 --> 20:42.366
No, not at all.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.994
Olaf, my Christian brother.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.248
Welcome!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.633
But they seem to like us.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.387
Brother Kåre.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.231
They're at least a full day ahead of us.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.358
-We should push on.
-No.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.903
They're not heading towards Kattegat.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.115
And the horses need rest.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.494
War is coming.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.497
And your name will gain more glory.

21:31.665 --> 21:35.127
So much that it will be known
all across the Viking world.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.839
Is that not what you wish?

21:41.425 --> 21:44.845
To have a name greater than your father's.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.516
How do you know of my father?

21:52.686 --> 21:56.064
I know he killed men
in Iceland and in Norway,

21:57.524 --> 22:03.196
but my family followed him to Greenland
out of respect for his courage.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.200
They followed him for his courage.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.872
But they bow their heads
out of fear, not respect.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.379
When I was young, I went with my father
to collect a lamb that was owed to him.

22:21.214 --> 22:26.094
And when my father couldn't claim it
because the lamb hadn't been born yet…

22:28.013 --> 22:30.682
I watched him beat a man
in front of his children

22:30.766 --> 22:32.559
until he could no longer stand.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.438
There is a darkness in him

22:38.273 --> 22:39.691
he cannot control.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.236
And I share it.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.240
If it is true,

22:48.742 --> 22:50.202
why have I never seen it?

22:52.913 --> 22:55.457
Because when I'm with you it goes away.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.085
And I'm calm.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.634
When I'm with you I can, uh…
I can do great things.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.345
The darkness does not overcome me.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.848
I can't explain it.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.031
Ha!

23:31.284 --> 23:32.661
-Gytha.
-Yes.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.206
Come.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.797
Princess Gytha.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.300
Who is it?

23:48.677 --> 23:50.011
It's I, Your Highness.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.139
With a visitor.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.645
I have come to deliver a wedding gift.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.816
It's beautiful.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.194
It was my mother's.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.281
Given to her
by her father-in-law, King Edgar.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.577
It was meant to remind her
of her importance to England.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.582
I hope you will accept it
in the same spirit.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.586
Thank you, Edmund.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.345
The great Olaf Haraldsson.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.600
Slaughterer of the worshipers
of Thor at Osilia and Herdaler.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.520
Cleanser of the heathens, sea wolf.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.440
-Here, among us.

24:46.902 --> 24:47.777
Why?

24:52.282 --> 24:55.827
I mean to unite Norway
under the banner of Christ.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
-And for that--
-You need Kattegat.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.918
The real seats of Norway's power.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.089
And to take Kattegat, I need you.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.927
Did you hear that, Old One?

25:12.552 --> 25:14.179
The time has arrived.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.767
I have been waiting for you, Brother Olaf.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.437
I have been waiting for this moment.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.399
You can count on my help.

25:28.568 --> 25:32.280
What do you require
for your services? Silver?

25:33.990 --> 25:38.203
Well, I have no interest in silver,
but I do have a price.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.791
Well, let me hear it then.

25:45.168 --> 25:51.967
God has instructed me
to build a great church in Kattegat,

25:53.426 --> 25:57.305
with a spire that reaches to Heaven.

25:58.306 --> 26:02.644
A beacon so that all who see it
may know the love of Jesus.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.772
And that is my price.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.069
You can have your church

26:12.070 --> 26:15.824
as long as Kattegat remains
a key trading port in my kingdom.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.242
Of course.

26:17.325 --> 26:20.912
Once it has been cleansed of
the heathen as we did with the Uppsala.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.584
-You destroyed Uppsala?
-Oh, yes.

26:26.376 --> 26:32.048
I burned it to the ground along with
its sham priests and false Gods.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.883
Didn't I?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.137
Who are you talking to?

26:37.220 --> 26:40.307
Just this old Pagan <i>seið</i>
whose sun has set.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.353
It is I who is the cross
that carries the sword.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.230
Not this girl you prophesied.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.691
What girl?

26:50.233 --> 26:53.361
A heathen… named Freydis.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.703
Ignore him, brother Olaf.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.914
He'll just try to tell you I'm mad.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.419
Do we have an agreement?

27:10.503 --> 27:11.379
Huh?

27:20.972 --> 27:22.974
Skol, bother Kåre.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.770
-Skol!
-Skol!

27:38.073 --> 27:40.283
-Those are Olaf's colors.
-Hmm.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.370
He has joined Kåre.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.831
Hyah! Hyah!

27:52.087 --> 27:53.421
Whoa.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.006
Good boy.

27:59.260 --> 28:02.180
Get up. That action means nothing to me.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.812
We are here, Your Highness.
Our presence counts for something.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.063
But does it count for me?

28:10.146 --> 28:12.774
We swore an oath to Canute
to support two kings.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.567
But that was before he married Emma.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.529
-What difference does that make?
-A great deal of difference.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.865
Should Canute die before me,
the throne returns to England.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.410
But should I die first,

28:23.493 --> 28:26.663
Canute's existing and future heirs
shall have sole claim.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.208
And if his marriage is
a true indication of his heart,

28:30.291 --> 28:33.128
you will be kneeling to
Viking kings for a long time.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.089
And it's clear that Forkbeard
intends to enforce that.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.884
The question then is, "When?"

28:40.552 --> 28:44.764
No. The initial question is, "Who?"

28:44.848 --> 28:47.559
Who here will support our English king?

29:01.364 --> 29:02.240
Agreed.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.658
Sire.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.201
Yes, sire.

29:05.910 --> 29:06.786
Sire.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.253
You have your answer.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.184
Are you thinking about
your lucky win the other day?

29:29.267 --> 29:30.101
Lucky?

29:31.144 --> 29:33.354
A pound of silver if you beat me again.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.440
Surely you're not scared.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.401
On the contrary, Your Highness,

29:39.027 --> 29:40.653
I simply do not wish to embarrass you.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.490
Come on!

29:43.990 --> 29:45.241
Hyah!

29:48.244 --> 29:50.455
And that is the king we are following.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.251
-Hyah!

30:07.430 --> 30:08.681
My lord, can you move?

30:11.100 --> 30:12.519
Quickly! Come down!

30:12.602 --> 30:14.687
-The rope.
-Come on!

30:15.897 --> 30:17.023
Here!

30:36.835 --> 30:37.836
You?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.838
Yes, Your Highness, me.

30:39.921 --> 30:40.964
But why?

30:41.965 --> 30:44.300
I have the nobles. I have the power.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.969
That is precisely why.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.889
I promise you, this will not take long.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.110
His horse stumbled.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.571
We saw. My God.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.780
Your Highness!

31:05.864 --> 31:07.949
Give him room, he's trying to speak.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.051
Thank God you were here to comfort him.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.389
The king is dead.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.018
No.

31:38.479 --> 31:39.480
Only one is.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.944
Sire, your loyal subjects--

31:45.028 --> 31:46.070
Stop, stop.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.533
What is your news?

31:52.118 --> 31:53.369
It is Edmund, sire.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.290
The young king is dead.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.500
-His horse failed him.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.131
Who witnessed this?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.384
We all did, sire.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.596
We were with him at the end.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.140
It was an act of God.

32:20.271 --> 32:24.192
The King Edmund is dead.
Long live King Canute.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.069
Long live King Canute.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.404
Long live King Canute!

32:40.500 --> 32:42.293
Olaf has joined forces with Kåre.

32:44.545 --> 32:45.380
Olaf?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.715
We recognized his banners,

32:47.799 --> 32:50.051
but there are many other clans
I do not know.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.220
It's a large force and growing.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.639
What about appealing
to friendly cities for help?

32:54.722 --> 32:57.934
We have. But many have
already been crushed by Kåre.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.894
Then we should prepare immediately,

33:00.478 --> 33:02.772
and learn what we can
about their numbers and strength.

33:02.855 --> 33:06.192
Agreed. Send spies
and see what they can find.

33:10.822 --> 33:11.656
Prince Harald.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.201
Jarl Haakon.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.914
I am glad you have chosen
to stay and fight with us,

33:19.998 --> 33:21.874
but it has placed you
against your brother.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.335
My brother has clearly made his choice.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.963
And I have made mine.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.717
I'm not fighting for the throne of Norway.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.427
I am fighting for Kattegat.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.143
-Another bandage.
-Yes.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.403
-Milady.
-Your Highness.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.696
Leave me with him.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.383
Your Highness wished to see me?

34:55.968 --> 34:58.346
I'm told you were
the first to reach him.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.807
I was, Your Highness.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.187
And he was dead when you discovered him?

35:07.188 --> 35:08.022
No.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.902
But his injuries were extensive.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.820
Clearly.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.782
And his pain must have been terrible.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.326
It was.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.455
Especially from the tiny cut

35:24.539 --> 35:26.874
beneath his left breast,
just below his heart.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.795
Of all his wounds, it was the most lethal
as it pierced his heart

35:30.878 --> 35:32.755
and filled his body with blood.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.676
Strange things happen in
these types of accidents, Your Highness.

35:36.759 --> 35:40.138
Strange? I would call it miraculous.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.682
Godwin.

35:43.599 --> 35:44.684
You may go.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.905
-Did you commission this murder?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.034
Must I remind you that the death of Edmund

36:02.118 --> 36:04.287
leaves only one king
on the throne of England?

36:05.037 --> 36:07.874
Which is crucial to Canute's power
and yours as his wife.

36:07.957 --> 36:12.128
King Forkbeard, I arrived
in this country as a 15-year-old girl,

36:12.211 --> 36:15.214
who could not speak the language
and was a piece of property.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.593
I am now the Queen of an expanding empire,

36:19.385 --> 36:21.345
and a wealthy woman in my own right.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.890
If you think that I'm incapable

36:23.973 --> 36:26.851
of taking care of both,
my husband's interest and my own,

36:27.685 --> 36:29.353
you do so at your own peril.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.699
I'm beginning to see
what my son admires in you.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.230
We will be ready.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.982
We are in the hands of the Gods.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.945
I prefer my fate be in my own hands.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.325
You make it very difficult sometimes…

37:26.494 --> 37:27.536
to love you.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.377
I want to keep you safe.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.297
I don't need that. I know Kåre--

37:38.381 --> 37:40.007
And I know my brother.

37:40.591 --> 37:44.136
He's self-centered, vain,
seeks only power.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.349
Sounds like someone else I know.

38:06.993 --> 38:07.827
Grandfather!

38:09.829 --> 38:10.871
Oh!

38:11.580 --> 38:12.873
We arrived last night.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.418
Mother wouldn't let us disturb you.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.676
How very thoughtful of her.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.430
Let me speak to your mother alone.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.695
Good morning, Aelfgifu.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.284
What has brought you
all the way to England?

38:49.493 --> 38:51.787
The crown that is due to me
as the wife of its king.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.207
If I remember correctly,

38:56.542 --> 38:59.795
you and my son were
hand-fasted in the Pagan way

38:59.879 --> 39:01.589
as he had yet not converted.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.595
In the eyes of God,
you were never married.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.932
I'll let you explain that technicality
to your grandsons.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.559
Mm.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.519
I'll be happy to.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.064
It's the way the world works.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.194
My son has made his commitment
to Queen Emma.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.947
Then you should be prepared
to lose Norway.

39:29.492 --> 39:32.411
Jarl Olaf visited me
upon his return from England.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.873
He shared with me
his plans to unite Norway.

39:36.832 --> 39:40.419
He then attempted to buy Denmark's fleet
for an invasion of Kattegat.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.671
You mean Canute's fleet?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.299
Canute and his army
are locked in land battle.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.551
In his absence, fleet answers to me.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.099
You brought the fleet to England?

39:54.642 --> 39:55.601
Where is it?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.396
Near, but far.

39:59.772 --> 40:03.859
Out of your sight,
but close enough to receive my command.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.496
I could have you killed right now.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.999
Quartered in front of me.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.002
Or tortured.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.131
I particularly don't like fire.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.052
But by the time you learn
the fleet's whereabouts,

40:30.136 --> 40:31.303
it would be too late.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.682
England is a country
with many places to hide.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.436
And if they don't hear from me
by a given hour, on a certain day,

40:39.353 --> 40:41.605
they sail for Kattegat under Olaf's flag.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.942
Only I can call them off.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.953
You're here to talk or to threaten?

40:57.580 --> 40:58.706
I have a problem.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.459
You killed my father, Leif Eriksson.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.253
As his son, I must defend his name.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.379
Must you?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.468
You know as well as I do
I was within my rights to defend myself.

41:11.218 --> 41:14.263
You also know if you were to fight me now,

41:14.346 --> 41:16.390
there is a very good chance
I will kill you.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.351
'Cause you're a great warrior, Arne.

41:20.352 --> 41:21.937
And the people of Kattegat,

41:23.355 --> 41:25.065
they need you to defend them now.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.782
So, you understand my problem.

41:35.367 --> 41:38.787
Look, I've only heard stories
of Odin's table.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.999
But I know if I was ever asked
to join the <i>einherjar</i>

41:42.082 --> 41:44.752
and I had to look
the Allfather in the eye…

41:48.130 --> 41:49.965
I would much rather do so as a warrior

41:51.133 --> 41:53.761
who died fighting
for his people and their beliefs.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.680
Instead of his father's tainted name.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.771
-Riders approach!

42:03.854 --> 42:05.689
Our scouts are returning!

42:09.693 --> 42:12.488
Whoa. Easy.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.664
We must find out their strength.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.417
If they are weak,
we should not be waiting in here,

42:26.001 --> 42:29.004
but attacking
before their forces grow any stronger.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.049
I agree. I'll go with you.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.551
We can spare neither of you.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.845
Let's get back to work.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.371
And who are you?

43:04.373 --> 43:06.375
I'm Queen Aelfgifu of Denmark

43:07.501 --> 43:08.961
and the wife of King Canute.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.054
I'm impressed with how… effortlessly

43:19.138 --> 43:21.432
you've made yourself
comfortable in my home.

43:23.183 --> 43:24.351
It is my home now.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.193
Really?

43:37.990 --> 43:40.451
I've heard of
delusionary people such as yourself.

43:42.244 --> 43:45.623
Please tell me how you managed
to convince yourself of such a fantasy.

43:49.335 --> 43:52.504
I am told you are an intelligent woman,
Emma of Normundy.

43:54.548 --> 43:56.342
Surely, you are astute enough to realize

43:56.425 --> 44:00.012
that if a wolf is roaming your halls
and warming itself by your fires,

44:01.430 --> 44:03.515
it must be considering you its dinner.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.615
You look troubled.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.870
I have many worries.

44:25.412 --> 44:27.748
Yes. I just met them.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.585
All of the traitors
gathering armies to steal Norway.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.588
And Aelfgifu controls Canute's fleet.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.925
She's hidden it somewhere here.

44:38.634 --> 44:42.721
I have sent men to search.
But it could take days, weeks.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.223
I have hours.

44:47.893 --> 44:50.396
If Olaf is allowed to take Norway,

44:50.979 --> 44:52.690
the entire North is threatened.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.234
And Aelfgifu knows it.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.783
I don't expect a woman like you

45:03.450 --> 45:05.994
to understand what that means to a Viking.

45:06.078 --> 45:10.499
But I do know
the blood of your people runs in my veins.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.377
I've never been to the North,
but I feel your anger.

45:14.670 --> 45:15.921
I feel your pain.

45:19.341 --> 45:23.011
I fell in love with your son
because he convinced me to trust him.

45:23.887 --> 45:28.225
He saved my children from Olaf
and now I must repay that trust.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.855
I know this country.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.984
I can help you, if you let me.

46:05.053 --> 46:08.348
Kattegat has seen trials before.

46:09.099 --> 46:13.145
Enemies from land and sea,
and days of darkness.

46:13.937 --> 46:18.025
In all times,
the Gods have been good to us.

46:18.108 --> 46:20.110
Sustained and protected us.

46:20.944 --> 46:26.158
Now we face a new challenge
in which we must ask their help.

46:27.367 --> 46:31.497
We call for a messenger
to journey to Asgard

46:31.580 --> 46:35.292
and plead our cause
to the Chief of the Æsir.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.170
-I will.
-I will.

46:38.754 --> 46:39.755
I… I will.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.973
What is your name?

46:50.057 --> 46:51.433
Audun Hoskuldsson.

47:00.567 --> 47:04.988
Do you willingly go to Odin
and deliver our cry for help?

47:05.072 --> 47:06.073
I do.

47:07.282 --> 47:10.911
I promise to be worthy of Kattegat.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.212
Prepare him for his journey.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.167
Queen Aelfgifu.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.880
Ny name is Earl Godwin.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.507
I am an advisor
to your husband, King Canute.

48:07.426 --> 48:09.386
It's refreshing to be greeted properly.

48:13.056 --> 48:14.057
It befits you.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.643
But despite your competence,

48:16.727 --> 48:18.604
it may be hard
to keep you at the king's side.

48:18.687 --> 48:20.564
I've come to offer my assistance.

48:20.647 --> 48:22.900
I've made my terms clear
with Sweyn Forkbeard.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.443
Why would I need your help?

48:24.526 --> 48:26.778
Because you may have
overestimated your leverage with him

48:26.862 --> 48:28.488
and underestimated Emma's.

48:29.281 --> 48:32.200
I know her and believe
I can help you in your quest.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.413
Why? What interest
do you have in my quest?

48:38.582 --> 48:41.251
Let's just say I have
my own history with Emma.

49:53.198 --> 49:54.491
Hyah!

50:17.222 --> 50:19.016
Prodigal brother returns.
