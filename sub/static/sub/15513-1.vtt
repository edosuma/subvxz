04:25.559 --> 04:27.153
In witness the name of the king.

04:27.154 --> 04:29.077
Public humiliation.

04:29.078 --> 04:30.931
Public punishment.

04:30.932 --> 04:35.111
Gather everyone in the square
public humiliation.

04:36.858 --> 04:38.375
Are you tired?

04:38.376 --> 04:43.319
We have not finished
in any case.

04:43.320 --> 04:51.582
When you look stoned?

04:57.243 --> 04:58.908
And ... there will be a
pleasant surprise.

04:58.909 --> 05:01.741
And ... a unique experience
today, at Louisbourg.

05:01.742 --> 05:04.775
We flogged ...

05:04.776 --> 05:09.155
Not as ...
xanamastigothei in his life!

05:09.190 --> 05:15.308
Long live the King!

05:15.309 --> 05:21.687
Regret?

05:21.688 --> 05:24.073
I see a lady

05:24.074 --> 05:27.356
d like to try
whipping.

05:27.357 --> 05:32.562
Does not?

05:32.563 --> 05:35.431
No, please stop!

05:35.432 --> 05:37.420
Please do not do it.
Do not do it!

05:37.421 --> 05:38.690
No, I will not.

05:38.691 --> 05:42.580
I came here to work, to
rebuild their brochure you.

05:42.581 --> 05:46.607
But please,
do me a favor.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.642
Put more power.

05:55.643 --> 05:57.375
Louder.

05:57.376 --> 06:06.367
Louder, louder!

06:07.484 --> 06:08.888
Very well.

06:08.889 --> 06:14.489
You have very audacity, sir.

06:14.490 --> 06:30.444
RETURN ON HEARING:

07:13.276 --> 07:19.039
Thank you.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.881
Hey.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.516
Hi ...

07:29.517 --> 07:37.760
I think I'm sitting here.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.053
Sorry, I know you from ...?

07:41.054 --> 07:42.904
Public humiliation.

07:42.905 --> 07:44.685
Well, obviously ...

07:44.686 --> 07:48.043
Not before? There you
I know from somewhere else?

07:48.044 --> 07:50.320
Not from what I know.

07:50.321 --> 07:52.505
Although my looks familiar.

07:52.506 --> 07:56.951
Yes ...

07:56.952 --> 07:59.376
Did you have an accident at Louisbourg;

07:59.377 --> 08:01.766
- What?
- The wheelchair.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.569
Something happened to your feet?

08:04.570 --> 08:07.986
No ... I have just one problem ...

08:07.987 --> 08:13.168
I can not walk over
than 5 minutes without help.

08:29.332 --> 08:36.751
- Here.
- Thank you.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.457
No, not you.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.613
Pardon

09:07.614 --> 09:13.152
Do not have an issue with your foot.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.885
Well ...

09:14.886 --> 09:18.854
Have to walk more
4 minutes around the castle.

09:18.855 --> 09:23.064
And he gave me and understood when
it's time for the whipping.

09:23.065 --> 09:27.972
Well, okay, now read.

09:27.973 --> 09:30.300
No, not read.

09:30.301 --> 09:34.595
I do not read.
Saw me sleeping.

09:40.346 --> 09:44.672
You missed a spot. There.

09:46.638 --> 09:49.710
Yeah, okay.

09:49.711 --> 09:52.083
Milk!

09:52.084 --> 09:54.812
Who orders
milk on airplanes?

09:54.813 --> 09:59.267
Tomato juice, jerk, this
you order the plane!

09:59.919 --> 10:02.319
"Dream for Hitler."

10:02.320 --> 10:04.207
Includes
famous analysis ...

10:04.208 --> 10:06.061
The whipping of feeling ...

10:06.062 --> 10:07.886
Are you okay?

10:07.887 --> 10:09.892
What are you reading?

10:09.893 --> 10:11.888
I fear airports.

10:11.889 --> 10:14.299
That's why you read about
Hitler in hits?

10:14.300 --> 10:21.706
You want me to answer?

10:21.707 --> 10:25.290
Flight fear response.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.773
At airports.

10:26.774 --> 10:29.593
Going from one
plane to another.

10:29.594 --> 10:32.378
To run, to hurry
I do not know ...

10:32.379 --> 10:36.119
Trying ... to find ...

10:36.120 --> 10:38.988
To wonder if
will do it ...

10:38.989 --> 10:40.932
What do you think will happen
if you do not succeed?

10:40.933 --> 10:43.482
I think I might be lost ...

10:43.483 --> 10:46.109
... And can
rot and die ...

10:46.110 --> 10:48.734
In ... a forgotten
Empty Terminal ...

10:48.735 --> 10:51.324
... Whose existence
no one knows.

10:51.325 --> 10:54.460
And that the flight would lose you.

10:54.461 --> 10:58.758
No ...
this is not the fear ...

10:58.759 --> 11:00.911
Then what are you afraid of?

11:00.912 --> 11:04.552
I fear the stress of
I wonder if you'll miss ...

11:04.553 --> 11:11.632
I do not like to be here
the intermediate ...

11:11.633 --> 11:16.133
I'm afraid to be afraid.

11:17.673 --> 11:22.107
Sounds like the most
dangerous thing in the world.

12:52.406 --> 12:55.572
Greetings.
We will make two stops ...

12:55.573 --> 12:58.900
62, MacLaughlin Crescent,
close to Queen ...

12:58.901 --> 13:00.489
Really?

13:00.490 --> 13:02.692
Yes, because you where you live?

13:02.693 --> 13:04.373
Very close, actually.

13:04.374 --> 13:06.887
- I will walk out of there.
- Really?

13:06.888 --> 13:08.804
Yes.

13:08.805 --> 13:11.409
Are you serious?

13:11.410 --> 13:13.973
Yes, why, where do you live?

13:13.974 --> 13:20.642
Very close.

13:54.741 --> 14:01.511
I am married.

14:01.512 --> 14:08.120
Pity.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.521
Pity, because I live here.

14:35.873 --> 14:42.558
Shit.

15:04.819 --> 15:12.043
Hey, baby.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.429
I love you so much ...

15:14.430 --> 15:19.363
Which ... will melt your head
the mill mashed ...

15:19.799 --> 15:21.234
I love you so much,

15:21.235 --> 15:25.385
that will put your spleen
minced his machine.

15:25.386 --> 15:29.227
And it is
rusty machine.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.361
I love you so much ...

15:31.362 --> 15:34.294
That ... I'll do
injection in the face ...

15:34.295 --> 15:39.774
with an awesome combination
from deadly viruses.

15:41.802 --> 15:46.265
Won, it made me laugh.

15:46.266 --> 15:50.227
What time will come by your own?

15:50.228 --> 15:53.412
When they manage to put their
children in the car, so ..

15:53.413 --> 15:58.136
Maybe ... in infinite time.

15:58.137 --> 16:02.192
I look forward to seeing the little Tony.

16:02.193 --> 16:04.591
It's very good.

16:04.592 --> 16:06.562
I will play with her.

16:06.563 --> 16:08.499
Will you do the monkey?

16:08.500 --> 16:10.025
Nicely.

16:10.026 --> 16:12.957
I will, really.

16:12.958 --> 16:15.381
I want to play with Tony.

16:15.382 --> 16:17.734
I know.

16:17.735 --> 16:19.805
And I know.

16:19.806 --> 16:26.808
I know already.

16:27.315 --> 16:34.174
I'm going to bathe.

16:35.088 --> 16:36.991
- Knock knock!
- Who is it?

16:36.992 --> 16:41.977
- A starfish interrupting.
- What is.

16:42.012 --> 16:44.566
Well, this. Do you understand?

16:44.567 --> 16:51.207
Knock it off!

16:53.225 --> 16:55.317
Jerry! Jerry!

16:55.318 --> 16:58.033
Why do not you want to go the
Tony Montesoriani in School?

16:58.034 --> 17:01.400
But I want to go!

17:01.401 --> 17:05.271
- Lies!
- Speak clearly.

17:05.271 --> 17:10.017
You want to do that work
a tavern princess?

17:13.214 --> 17:20.915
Welcome to our restaurant.

17:22.577 --> 17:27.958
Would you like some chicken?

17:27.959 --> 17:31.504
It's okay, do not
hit really.

17:31.505 --> 17:34.043
Thank you.

17:34.044 --> 17:36.247
I do not like so the brie.

17:36.248 --> 17:38.482
It's a little bland.

17:38.483 --> 17:40.801
Bland!

17:40.802 --> 17:44.718
Make sure to mark
what you do not like, Mom.

17:44.719 --> 17:48.916
Indeed it does.

17:48.917 --> 17:53.630
I'll take them.
It's all wonderful.

17:53.631 --> 17:55.068
Thank you.

17:55.069 --> 17:56.875
And I like people to serve.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.083
And I like to
see you sit.

17:59.084 --> 18:01.745
You deserve it.

18:01.746 --> 18:03.925
I love these flowers.

18:03.926 --> 18:10.360
I know it is not beautiful?

18:10.361 --> 18:12.390
I'll tell you what does not help.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.949
Every book you read
for that matter, says ...

18:15.950 --> 18:19.449
for people
backslide 8 times ...

18:19.450 --> 18:22.880
Well, I am well
honestly, but ...

18:22.881 --> 18:29.027
This ... is the feeling that
are waiting to fail ...

18:29.369 --> 18:31.250
You look very well.

18:31.251 --> 18:32.490
I know.

18:32.491 --> 18:35.171
Truth. Look in
mirror and want to fuck with.

18:35.172 --> 18:41.650
I honestly believe that I look
better than before I gave birth to Tony.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.129
Think about it?

18:43.130 --> 18:47.357
Yes ... You look fantastic!
- Thank you.

18:47.392 --> 18:51.514
It is from these moments that you want
Your answer to the other immediately.

18:52.914 --> 18:57.640
I do not think it will fail.

18:57.641 --> 19:00.573
Do not look at me like that.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.669
With this sincere look ...

19:02.670 --> 19:03.959
... Like a baby fawn.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.027
The next time you wake up
inside me vomit ...

19:06.028 --> 19:09.300
... You should feel
guilty about you.

19:09.301 --> 19:12.389
Then do not do it.

19:12.390 --> 19:15.634
Do not wake up in
in your vomit.

19:15.635 --> 19:19.007
I put my best.

19:19.008 --> 19:22.800
On Tuesday I will close 10 months.

19:22.801 --> 19:30.253
Very nice!

19:36.114 --> 19:38.475
Okay, enough.
Get off me.

19:38.476 --> 19:41.185
Nobody died.

19:41.186 --> 19:47.506
Being "the good
new ", you know?

19:47.507 --> 19:51.569
Okay, guys, it's time.

19:51.570 --> 19:59.952
Bye, sweetie!

20:01.018 --> 20:06.818
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

20:09.340 --> 20:14.843
- I love you so much.
- Thank you, aunt.

20:14.844 --> 20:19.790
Take us somewhere.

20:19.791 --> 20:27.105
Very French style yourself.

21:34.456 --> 21:37.218
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:37.219 --> 21:40.690
Do not even know what my
fix for breakfast.

21:40.691 --> 21:49.094
I do not know what my
fix you breakfast!

22:14.227 --> 22:15.541
What

22:15.542 --> 22:22.084
What "what"?

22:49.887 --> 22:53.317
What

22:53.318 --> 22:55.746
Glad you're here.

22:55.747 --> 23:00.062
Yes?

23:00.063 --> 23:06.479
Yes.

23:16.187 --> 23:21.523
- Bad baby.
- No, I am not a bad baby!

23:21.558 --> 23:23.676
No?'re Not
evil baby? No.?

23:23.677 --> 23:26.494
You look like the worst
baby in the world.

23:26.495 --> 23:29.277
I'm not a bad baby,
I'm mad at you.

23:29.278 --> 23:30.635
Are you mad
my baby?

23:30.636 --> 23:32.664
Yes, I'm mad at you.

23:32.665 --> 23:35.208
I love you, baby.

23:35.209 --> 23:37.691
We can not play
"evil baby" anymore?

23:37.692 --> 23:46.251
Do not kiss the time
we call such.

23:46.884 --> 23:50.372
Merry.

23:50.373 --> 23:56.935
Wait.

23:57.991 --> 23:59.796
What

23:59.797 --> 24:01.102
I will continue to
I make breakfast

24:01.103 --> 24:05.482
and you continue to require
how to become everything.

24:05.483 --> 24:13.130
I did not ...

24:14.830 --> 24:21.513
Sorry.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.243
Howdy.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.172
Hi!

25:48.173 --> 25:49.542
Where are you going?

25:49.543 --> 25:51.213
At the grocery store.

25:51.214 --> 25:52.814
Big breakfast?

25:52.815 --> 25:56.716
Great breakfast, start early.

25:56.717 --> 25:59.292
You mean because both
early in the grocery store.

25:59.293 --> 26:00.823
No, no, just woke up.

26:00.824 --> 26:02.102
Naturally.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.734
What does this mean

26:03.735 --> 26:07.829
Irritable, irritable lady.

26:07.830 --> 26:11.321
Who needs a rickshaw
at 5 am, asshole?

26:11.322 --> 26:14.353
I go to the lake
shortly before dawn.

26:14.354 --> 26:16.714
And then I go straight to work.
It makes no sense ...

26:16.715 --> 26:19.679
I just do not like to
I come home in between.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.218
- You go to the lake?
- Yes.

26:22.219 --> 26:23.874
To think?

26:23.875 --> 26:25.199
Yes.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.588
- This is so gay.
- Gay?

26:28.589 --> 26:31.311
You adelfara.

26:31.312 --> 26:33.565
What are you? 12 years old in 1982?

26:33.566 --> 26:35.454
Who says that word anymore?

26:35.455 --> 26:37.309
Who go every
morning on the lake?

26:37.310 --> 26:38.328
Ego.

26:38.329 --> 26:42.094
The sisters.

26:42.095 --> 26:45.499
I think I woke up early
to insult me.

26:45.500 --> 26:51.465
You think?

26:51.606 --> 26:54.209
Nice talking to you ...

26:54.210 --> 26:56.763
To do it again some
time to drink coffee.

26:56.764 --> 26:59.044
- It is a call-shot?
- What?

26:59.045 --> 27:02.961
It is an invitation-shoot
or a normal call?

27:02.962 --> 27:05.436
Like, "had to ask him if he wants
drink coffee sometime ...

27:05.437 --> 27:07.619
But ... I have no
intend to do. "

27:07.620 --> 27:09.768
Significant difference from
normal call.

27:09.769 --> 27:12.277
No, it is a call-shot.

27:12.278 --> 27:19.475
Okay, then,
what about now?

27:19.476 --> 27:22.781
Let the gay office
you for me.

27:22.782 --> 27:28.981
Stop it.

27:35.879 --> 27:40.512
So what will you do
Now with me?

27:40.547 --> 27:42.680
What do you mean?

27:42.681 --> 27:46.579
To "succeed" now.
What will you do?

27:46.580 --> 27:48.555
To "succeed" now?

27:48.556 --> 27:51.639
Yesterday I woke up early,
and saw me leave,

27:51.640 --> 27:53.880
I do not "succeed" anywhere.

27:53.881 --> 27:59.647
And now with "succeed."
Now what would you do?

28:04.243 --> 28:10.861
Nothing.

28:10.862 --> 28:13.671
Maybe simple is good ...

28:13.672 --> 28:18.322
Talking normally ...
between us, so ...

28:18.323 --> 28:21.789
That things ...
not be so ...

28:21.790 --> 28:24.023
- ... charged?
- No, I did not say "charged".

28:24.024 --> 28:25.393
- Well.
- I never said "charged".

28:25.394 --> 28:31.254
Got it.

28:36.431 --> 28:44.625
Can I show you something?

29:07.727 --> 29:11.255
Well it would seem
bit like monitoring ..

29:11.256 --> 29:13.226
But ... you're the one
he woke up at 5.30;

29:13.227 --> 29:19.103
to follow me,
so ...

29:19.104 --> 29:25.339
This ...

29:25.340 --> 29:33.872
Causes me consternation ... basically ...

29:34.413 --> 29:36.471
All right.

29:36.472 --> 29:38.954
I guess my answer
is, "Fuck you".

29:38.955 --> 29:40.320
What

29:40.321 --> 29:42.587
One side is
full of hope.

29:42.588 --> 29:44.176
Yes, but the other side
is a junkie,

29:44.177 --> 29:45.804
ready to fountarei
a bridge.

29:45.805 --> 29:47.061
No, you become melodramatic.

29:47.062 --> 29:50.371
One side does not respond
rather the full dynamics.

29:50.372 --> 29:57.749
The one on my side, or
one side of the picture?

29:57.750 --> 30:00.852
Well ...

30:00.853 --> 30:04.854
And ... it was very
good idea, obviously.

30:07.007 --> 30:09.708
You want something to drink,
or another coffee ...?

30:09.709 --> 30:10.732
No, no, no.

30:10.733 --> 30:13.446
- Water?
- No, I must go.

30:13.447 --> 30:17.384
Then why not do it?

30:17.385 --> 30:19.256
So you're an artist.

30:19.257 --> 30:22.390
Why do not you sit?

30:22.391 --> 30:24.580
No, I paint.

30:24.581 --> 30:26.700
What does this mean

30:26.701 --> 30:29.455
It means that for paint
myself, and ...

30:29.456 --> 30:32.140
... Pay my rent,
carrying the rickshaw ...

30:32.141 --> 30:35.372
... Through the city streets, as
bum one of the modern era.

30:35.373 --> 30:36.764
You show your work anywhere?

30:36.765 --> 30:38.151
No.

30:38.152 --> 30:40.070
Why

30:40.071 --> 30:47.394
Because I'm a coward.

30:47.395 --> 30:52.022
These are then.

30:52.023 --> 30:53.655
- No.
- No?

30:53.656 --> 30:55.254
I'm not sitting.

30:55.255 --> 31:01.527
Merry.

31:02.548 --> 31:05.421
What about you?

31:05.422 --> 31:08.135
I want to write.

31:08.136 --> 31:11.623
- You do?
- Not now. Not yet.

31:11.624 --> 31:15.076
Write, but not those
I want to write.

31:15.077 --> 31:17.182
But yeah.

31:17.183 --> 31:22.193
Then why ...?
What prevents you?

31:29.482 --> 31:31.885
What's wrong with you?

31:31.886 --> 31:34.195
General.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.293
You look worried.

31:37.294 --> 31:39.564
I do not mean just now ...

31:39.565 --> 31:47.740
I mean ... in general.

31:57.503 --> 32:02.426
I remember when my niece,
The Tony was newborn ...

32:03.212 --> 32:05.163
Reserving the ... ...

32:05.164 --> 32:10.379
... And sometimes crying,
as do babies, and ...

32:10.380 --> 32:14.903
And ... I did what I could
to find the cause.

32:14.938 --> 32:17.623
Hungry, is tired?

32:17.624 --> 32:20.272
Has rash?

32:20.273 --> 32:24.832
9 times out of 10 I
solve the problem, but ...

32:28.357 --> 32:32.787
Sometimes ... I do not know ...

32:35.268 --> 32:39.231
Sometimes ...

32:39.232 --> 32:42.162
I walk in the street, and ...

32:42.163 --> 32:46.939
... A ray of light illuminates a
special way the sidewalk ...

32:46.974 --> 32:50.950
And ... I want to cry ...

32:50.951 --> 32:54.992
And ... after a
second over.

32:54.993 --> 32:58.690
And I decide, because
I'm an adult.

32:58.691 --> 33:05.792
Decide not to leave
the emotional moment.

33:06.102 --> 33:11.675
and this some thought
times with Tony.

33:12.828 --> 33:17.761
And she just lived
such a time.

33:17.762 --> 33:21.052
One moment he did not know
how and why

33:21.053 --> 33:24.952
and just let herself.

33:24.953 --> 33:27.999
And he could not do
someone something about it.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.792
To make it better.
He was alone.

33:31.793 --> 33:35.550
And the fact that
're alive ...

33:35.551 --> 33:39.624
Conflict ... with this ...

33:41.621 --> 33:45.785
Yes.

33:45.786 --> 33:49.939
Or just do not understand
what it was.

33:52.486 --> 33:57.002
Yes.

33:57.003 --> 34:04.507
I guess though
this is likely.

34:04.508 --> 34:06.347
The fact that I met you.

34:06.348 --> 34:13.118
Seems inevitable.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.438
I think I saw
something in your eye.

34:17.438 --> 34:20.156
No, I think I
I saw something in your eye.

34:20.157 --> 34:22.840
Indeed I think
I saw something in your eye.

34:22.841 --> 34:25.915
No, I saw something
in thine eye.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.844
It's so weird, because ...

34:27.846 --> 34:31.277
I was so sure
that you had something!

34:31.279 --> 34:37.478
I guess that I'm wrong
got something in your eye.

34:40.152 --> 34:45.129
Come on.

34:45.130 --> 34:51.643
All right.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.176
Lou!

35:08.177 --> 35:10.958
We need to see this.

35:10.959 --> 35:18.671
With rain and cold water.

35:48.596 --> 35:50.141
Lou?

35:50.142 --> 35:51.281
Yes?

35:51.282 --> 35:54.718
- Do you have a job?
- Yes.

35:54.719 --> 36:00.991
No.

36:19.755 --> 36:24.575
I want to zoulixo until
I leave all the snot ..

36:24.876 --> 36:27.287
I want to be raped
with scissors ...

36:27.288 --> 36:29.665
Until they die ...
by bleeding.

36:29.666 --> 36:31.612
Very far fetched.

36:31.613 --> 36:39.987
Much? No, it was
far fetched

36:39.988 --> 36:44.732
Will scratch the
grater for the potatoes.

36:44.733 --> 36:46.755
Is that all?

36:46.756 --> 36:50.698
This is silly.
It's scary!

36:50.699 --> 36:54.571
Not in the grater
for potatoes.

36:54.572 --> 36:56.684
When did you start to win
in this game?

36:56.685 --> 36:58.084
I do not know.

36:58.085 --> 37:03.800
Perhaps it means that now
I love you more.

37:03.801 --> 37:05.844
I love you.

37:05.845 --> 37:07.965
Why

37:07.966 --> 37:12.207
I love most.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.922
I really love you.

37:14.923 --> 37:20.023
I love you.

37:20.024 --> 37:22.224
I love ...

37:22.225 --> 37:24.518
So ... much.

37:24.519 --> 37:27.735
I can not in
love you so much.

37:27.736 --> 37:29.711
Take me away.

37:29.712 --> 37:32.597
Well, well. Careful.

37:32.598 --> 37:36.482
- Bad time?
- Poor time.

37:36.483 --> 37:39.746
When you make chicken must
carefully cleaned.

37:39.747 --> 37:42.167
The groin their
are poisonous.

37:42.168 --> 37:44.968
Where touch
let salmonella.

37:44.969 --> 37:46.907
You're hot and sweaty.

37:46.908 --> 37:48.133
I know, it's hot.

37:48.134 --> 37:52.523
We need to cook at high
temperature for germs.

38:02.713 --> 38:04.397
I missed you.

38:04.398 --> 38:06.854
Me too.

38:06.855 --> 38:08.863
It's lonely up there.

38:08.864 --> 38:11.739
There are more solitary?

38:11.740 --> 38:15.412
Did you get a dog?

38:15.413 --> 38:17.169
A small dog.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.460
Really?

38:18.461 --> 38:19.834
I love dogs.

38:19.835 --> 38:22.818
If you feel lonely, you
to have the dog.

38:22.819 --> 38:26.215
The dog is like
preparation for a child.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.886
No! Rather preparation
a cow.

38:29.887 --> 38:31.960
Or a larger animal.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.598
This one.

38:33.599 --> 38:37.620
Usually, when a couple gets dog
two years to make and child.

38:37.655 --> 38:40.161
Perhaps if we take a
very small dog,

38:40.162 --> 38:43.866
make child 6
years, or something.

38:43.867 --> 38:50.795
I do not want to discuss it.

39:01.988 --> 39:05.669
You do not know how stupid I feel.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.938
Come, my sweet,
not spoil me.

39:07.939 --> 39:09.851
This is my joy.

39:09.852 --> 39:13.175
Well, ladies,
look at me, okay!

39:13.176 --> 39:17.080
What are ready to
rocking the pool?

39:17.081 --> 39:20.361
My name is Terry, and I am happy
I see new faces.

39:20.362 --> 39:22.981
Hi Irene, how
is the operation?

39:22.982 --> 39:25.566
- Well!
- Good. We start walking.

39:25.567 --> 39:30.014
We walk the same spot.

39:30.015 --> 39:31.260
And punch.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.778
And punch.
Putting bad person.

39:33.779 --> 39:35.346
And punch, punch.

39:35.347 --> 39:37.578
I look up to the knees.

39:37.579 --> 39:40.143
I can see, because the
water is transparent.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.673
Like puppets, and
hand toward the heel.

39:42.674 --> 39:44.545
I am a puppet,
I am a puppet.

39:44.546 --> 39:46.919
On the move by move.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.259
Three other times.

39:49.260 --> 39:50.388
Other two.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.404
And I lied.
Xanaeipa your lies.

39:53.405 --> 39:55.100
I'm as big a liar.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.397
No more.
Come close to the edge of the pool.

39:57.398 --> 39:58.997
Do you know what follows.

39:58.998 --> 40:00.528
We will work away.

40:00.529 --> 40:03.591
Someone pushed to
street, what would you do?

40:03.592 --> 40:05.256
Kick him in the face!

40:05.257 --> 40:07.555
As loud as you can!
Kick him!

40:07.556 --> 40:12.057
Kick, kick!

40:12.092 --> 40:15.260
To hear you say, "Yes!"

40:15.261 --> 40:20.376
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

40:20.377 --> 40:23.172
Move away from the edge.
The center.

40:23.173 --> 40:24.213
Come on.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.120
Continue on foot.

40:26.121 --> 40:28.329
Hands in circles.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.503
- Amused?
- Yes!

40:30.504 --> 40:31.779
Hands in circles.

40:31.780 --> 40:33.612
Shoulders. Clapping ...

40:33.613 --> 40:34.962
Shoulders. Clapping.

40:34.963 --> 40:37.420
- We tell everyone, "yes".
- Yes!

40:37.421 --> 40:39.844
- You're not listening!
- Yes!

40:39.845 --> 40:41.254
Now for skiing.

40:41.255 --> 40:44.078
Skiing! Jog ... and shoot.

40:44.079 --> 40:48.947
Push, pull.
Push, pull ...

40:48.948 --> 40:50.804
Go on digging.

40:50.805 --> 40:53.787
Gold! I found gold!

40:53.788 --> 40:57.247
Gold!

40:57.248 --> 41:00.149
Let's make jazz
movements as they walk.

41:00.150 --> 41:01.848
Go.

41:01.849 --> 41:03.286
Yes!

41:03.287 --> 41:05.190
Make my faces jazz.

41:05.191 --> 41:10.447
Persons jazz.

41:10.448 --> 41:14.223
And toggles.

41:14.224 --> 41:15.974
Okay, ladies!

41:15.975 --> 41:18.408
Loop.

41:18.409 --> 41:20.749
I think I'll pee.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.172
No, no!

41:22.173 --> 41:26.350
They put something in the water,
that color.

41:33.721 --> 41:35.923
All out, please!

41:35.924 --> 41:38.091
Soiled the pool.

41:38.092 --> 41:41.144
All out.

41:41.145 --> 41:43.330
Very funny.

41:43.331 --> 41:46.046
Yes, it's very funny.
Pees in the pool.

41:46.047 --> 41:49.196
Not nice, guys.
Not at all.

41:49.197 --> 41:55.779
All out.

41:55.780 --> 42:00.788
Here piss, Margo.
In the shower, like a lady.

42:01.117 --> 42:03.314
It is too
difficult for me,

42:03.315 --> 42:06.127
help myself not to send
All e-mails on this subject.

42:06.128 --> 42:08.889
There was no need to
come with me.

42:08.890 --> 42:11.146
Let us since until
finished the course.

42:11.147 --> 42:17.107
At least manage to
Gymnasts abs.

42:23.913 --> 42:26.067
Sometimes I wonder
whether it makes sense

42:26.068 --> 42:27.864
I shave my legs.

42:27.865 --> 42:32.576
And I'm sure James does not
'll watch anyway.

42:32.792 --> 42:36.117
Why shave my legs?

42:36.118 --> 42:38.289
Love in marriage.

42:38.290 --> 42:40.392
Somewhat depressing.

42:40.393 --> 42:43.243
Sometimes I think,
after 10 years ...

42:43.244 --> 42:47.032
... Who will be interested
whether shave my legs?

42:47.033 --> 42:50.787
At least after both
time I like James.

42:50.788 --> 42:52.608
Worth haggle
do all this ...

42:52.609 --> 42:55.126
Something shocking ...
with someone

42:55.127 --> 43:00.346
that may not be my
like in 10 years?

43:00.347 --> 43:01.722
I do not know.

43:01.723 --> 43:05.226
Sometimes I
just something new.

43:05.227 --> 43:08.080
The new one is shiny.

43:08.081 --> 43:12.664
The new becomes old.

43:12.665 --> 43:15.514
Well, new
become old ...

43:15.515 --> 43:23.296
Just ...
made and old.

43:39.393 --> 43:41.420
I hate you more than
anyone I've ever met

43:41.421 --> 43:43.415
fucking in my life!

43:43.416 --> 43:48.227
Although I do not like to swear
I admit that I hate completely.

43:49.704 --> 43:51.375
I need a drink.

43:51.376 --> 43:52.977
IIt two o'clock.

43:52.978 --> 43:54.493
You sure will
sit in a public place ...

43:54.494 --> 43:58.798
Not ashamed ... after
what did you do in the pool?

43:58.799 --> 44:02.170
Are you completely hated.

44:02.171 --> 44:09.108
Let's get martinis.

44:12.378 --> 44:14.282
- Drink.
- You drink.

44:14.283 --> 44:15.475
First you.

44:15.476 --> 44:18.408
I do not want to get drunk with you.

44:18.409 --> 44:23.045
Impressed with
the consistency you.

44:23.046 --> 44:26.214
I want ...

44:26.215 --> 44:28.883
Do you want ...?

44:28.884 --> 44:35.564
I want to know ...

44:35.565 --> 44:44.431
I want to know what I do.

44:51.574 --> 44:53.615
I said it so simply.

44:53.616 --> 45:01.359
Just like that.

45:03.193 --> 45:07.000
Just kissed the top
of the head.

45:07.001 --> 45:09.779
Too soft ...

45:09.780 --> 45:13.097
- Really?
- Yes.

45:13.098 --> 45:18.352
And then ...
I kissed your eyelids ...

45:18.387 --> 45:22.123
Flickered ... and,
beneath my lips.

45:22.124 --> 45:24.538
- A little.
- A little ...

45:24.539 --> 45:31.885
And ... much too late ...

45:32.234 --> 45:36.989
I touched his lips ...
I with mine.

45:39.986 --> 45:44.804
But because you're married,
I did not dare to kiss.

45:44.805 --> 45:48.597
- No.
- No.

45:48.598 --> 45:54.704
Instead, I went
slowly into your throat ...

45:54.937 --> 45:58.256
And ... I kissed every inch of.

45:58.257 --> 46:02.758
And I stopped for a while ...

46:02.793 --> 46:07.286
Sign ... to have
on your left shoulder.

46:07.287 --> 46:11.468
Yeah, that.

46:11.469 --> 46:14.183
And ...

46:14.184 --> 46:18.674
In ... smelled.

46:18.675 --> 46:22.753
Inhale and smell.

46:25.103 --> 46:27.243
How do I smell?

46:27.244 --> 46:30.459
You smell like you.

46:30.460 --> 46:36.104
Like the smell of the plane.
As you smell now.

46:36.139 --> 46:39.628
A mixture ...

46:39.629 --> 46:43.545
Sweetness ... and ...

46:43.546 --> 46:48.227
... Fuck.

46:48.228 --> 46:51.378
And then I kissed your breasts.

46:51.379 --> 46:54.459
And I licked her nipples ...

46:54.460 --> 46:59.452
And stayed there ...
in no time.

46:59.453 --> 47:01.718
And ... I touch you softly
in the beginning, but ...

47:01.719 --> 47:03.949
I understood from the ...
Your reaction to that ..

47:03.950 --> 47:08.094
You do not want ...
I'm gentle.

47:08.095 --> 47:09.691
No?

47:09.692 --> 47:15.910
No.

47:15.911 --> 47:20.970
And then I thought, that

47:21.372 --> 47:24.751
How reacts every point
of her body.

47:24.752 --> 47:28.097
And I worked almost
one and a half week ...

47:28.098 --> 47:29.967
... With your body ...

47:29.968 --> 47:32.300
And ... I started to learn.

47:32.301 --> 47:36.450
And to know.

47:36.451 --> 47:41.502
Each detail.

47:41.503 --> 47:43.952
And ...

47:43.953 --> 47:47.472
I played with you ... ...

47:47.473 --> 47:50.922
Before ... go inside.

47:50.923 --> 47:55.512
Before you open your legs ...

47:56.170 --> 47:59.985
Fuck you ... and loud.

47:59.986 --> 48:03.418
Fuck you harder
than I wanted.

48:03.419 --> 48:06.184
But I could not
to resist.

48:06.185 --> 48:09.364
And I pulled
soft hair ...

48:09.365 --> 48:13.013
And was moving ...
inside you ...

48:13.014 --> 48:15.044
Fuck your mouth ...

48:15.045 --> 48:17.005
Every point ... and you ...

48:17.006 --> 48:22.001
Until we turned ...
so much ...

48:22.036 --> 48:26.402
We could not ...
to see clearly, and ...

48:26.437 --> 48:29.975
I filled in ... with my sperm ...

48:29.976 --> 48:33.016
And ... ...

48:33.017 --> 48:37.402
I told you ... and again
again, "I love you."

48:43.125 --> 48:51.220
I love you.

49:15.871 --> 49:24.479
- These martinis are ...
- Probably unnecessary.

49:29.607 --> 49:35.627
Leave.

49:35.628 --> 49:37.227
One more thing.

49:37.228 --> 49:40.220
Yes.

49:40.221 --> 49:43.967
Because nothing of all this,
not going to happen ...

49:43.968 --> 49:46.103
I close ... one
appointment with you?

49:46.104 --> 49:51.002
What kind of appointment?

49:51.003 --> 49:58.803
An appointment to kiss you.

49:58.804 --> 50:02.288
My program
is very elastic.

50:02.289 --> 50:05.837
It will be in 30 years?

50:05.838 --> 50:08.244
Thirty years?

50:08.245 --> 50:11.802
I'd like to meet
the fountain ...

50:11.803 --> 50:15.059
Lighthouse ... in Louisbourg.

50:15.060 --> 50:18.564
Here I want to meet.

50:18.565 --> 50:21.181
I'm 58 ...

50:21.182 --> 50:23.275
I do not know how you will be.

50:23.276 --> 50:24.836
I'm 59.

50:24.837 --> 50:30.063
I would like to see you there,
this day in ...

50:32.869 --> 50:36.235
2.00 ... 'm m, eastern time.

50:36.236 --> 50:40.486
On August 5, 2040.
And I 'd like to kiss you.

50:40.521 --> 50:42.822
Until then, I'm married.

50:42.823 --> 50:45.215
But after 35 years will
I'm faithful to my husband ...

50:45.216 --> 50:48.453
I think ... I'll have
win a kiss.

50:48.454 --> 50:56.563
I'm going home to clean.

51:09.571 --> 51:16.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:23.348 --> 51:27.014
- Do I need to shower.
- Not doing there?

51:27.015 --> 51:31.136
No.

51:31.137 --> 51:35.611
I think I will accept
motion to stay here.

51:35.846 --> 51:42.387
Merry.

51:57.196 --> 52:02.020
Damn it!

52:02.021 --> 52:03.931
Is "katsatore."

52:03.932 --> 52:05.829
Chapter I
the "katsatore" ...

52:05.830 --> 52:09.310
So ... should I make
very "katsatore."

52:09.311 --> 52:11.324
This time I put
chillies.

52:11.325 --> 52:19.222
How do you think you are,
with hot peppers?

52:19.223 --> 52:23.180
I do not care.

52:23.181 --> 52:29.899
Thank you.

52:30.785 --> 52:33.639
Okay, you could ...

52:33.640 --> 52:41.871
Look ... I do not want to fill
Part of gravy, so ..

52:44.951 --> 52:53.259
Okay, seriously now ...

53:02.938 --> 53:08.227
What? Where are you going?

53:08.228 --> 53:13.659
What happened?

53:13.660 --> 53:17.157
You know that you need
courage to do this?

53:17.158 --> 53:21.617
What?

53:21.618 --> 53:27.162
Be to "seduce".

53:27.163 --> 53:29.014
I put all my courage,

53:29.015 --> 53:33.919
And you learn to be
with no courage.

53:34.278 --> 53:36.543
It takes courage to
"Seductions" your husband?

53:36.544 --> 53:37.335
Yes.

53:37.336 --> 53:39.812
He wants all
courage the world.

53:39.813 --> 53:41.035
This is ridiculous.

53:41.036 --> 53:42.874
Is it?

53:42.875 --> 53:45.547
Then why prove it
everything that I'm right?

53:45.548 --> 53:47.913
When I feel that I get
a big risk ...

53:47.914 --> 53:50.210
I prove it ...
everything that I was right ...

53:50.211 --> 53:54.129
And ... that the risk is greater
from what I can manage.

53:54.130 --> 53:56.015
Why ...

53:56.016 --> 53:58.587
Good ... to ...

53:58.588 --> 54:03.699
Talking about ...?

54:03.700 --> 54:06.790
I just cook chicken.

54:06.791 --> 54:14.475
You always cook chicken.

54:14.476 --> 54:20.549
Yes.

55:05.447 --> 55:13.059
I go to the pool.

58:11.173 --> 58:12.596
I must get out.

58:12.597 --> 58:15.316
Scared you fear?

58:15.317 --> 58:19.355
I'm very sorry ...
was a bad idea.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:04.176
Well ... well ... Yes.

01:01:06.017 --> 01:01:12.097
Got it.

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:19.167
Yes ... indeed.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.299
Yes!

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:26.516
No, it makes sense, absolutely.
It has ...

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:30.632
Makes sense ... ...

01:01:30.633 --> 01:01:35.490
Okay, okay ...

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:40.060
No, do not do anything ...

01:01:40.061 --> 01:01:43.997
No, we do not understand ...

01:01:43.998 --> 01:01:49.667
Yes.

01:01:49.668 --> 01:01:53.826
Two months Yes,
can be done.

01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:58.514
All right.

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:01.625
Very nice, I appreciate it.

01:02:01.626 --> 01:02:09.088
Similarly, yes.

01:02:12.473 --> 01:02:17.786
Yes ...

01:02:17.787 --> 01:02:20.181
Yes ... All right.

01:02:20.182 --> 01:02:26.136
Yes.

01:02:26.137 --> 01:02:32.953
I did not realize that there was
in this contract.

01:02:32.954 --> 01:02:37.104
Merry.

01:02:37.105 --> 01:02:40.304
Merry.

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:43.056
Shall I wait

01:02:43.057 --> 01:02:46.677
Yes, I can wait.

01:02:46.678 --> 01:02:50.756
What are you doing?

01:02:50.757 --> 01:02:52.906
Okay, stop, seriously.

01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:54.961
I almost laugh 5 times.
Watch out!

01:02:54.962 --> 01:02:58.430
Yes, here I am. Yes ...

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:03.681
I'm not Lin ... sorry ...

01:03:04.924 --> 01:03:08.598
Just got my wife.

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:17.205
And wears a funny dress.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.299
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.085
Sorry for the pool.

01:03:27.086 --> 01:03:31.190
No need to apologize.
I made a nice bathroom.

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:37.629
I gotta go.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:41.201
All right.

01:03:41.202 --> 01:03:45.368
- Today is our anniversary.
- Well. I mean ...

01:03:45.403 --> 01:03:48.009
You only know 5
weeks, but I. ..

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:49.735
Want to celebrate ...
anniversaries ...

01:03:49.736 --> 01:03:58.136
Gem ... my
an emerald 17 inches.

01:03:58.137 --> 01:04:01.020
How long have you been married?

01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:03.356
Almost five years.

01:04:03.357 --> 01:04:05.297
What does the "man" you?

01:04:05.298 --> 01:04:07.169
Why the quotes?

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:10.927
Because the word "spouse"
is funny.

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:13.194
Writes cookbooks.

01:04:13.195 --> 01:04:14.882
Cookbooks?

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:18.112
Books for chickens ...
Books for cooking chicken ...

01:04:18.113 --> 01:04:20.224
Books ... how to
cook the chicken.

01:04:20.225 --> 01:04:21.264
Only chicken?

01:04:21.265 --> 01:04:24.633
Yes, only.

01:04:24.634 --> 01:04:29.362
- Eating too chicken?
- You can not imagine!

01:04:30.641 --> 01:04:32.927
But it is a very good cook.

01:04:32.928 --> 01:04:34.809
If you like chicken.

01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:36.621
Do you like chicken?

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:40.394
Naturally. When it is cooked.

01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:42.856
The house always smells
nicely when cooked ...

01:04:42.857 --> 01:04:45.391
Only ... the smell of garbage
chicken is disgusting.

01:04:45.392 --> 01:04:46.803
Hi!

01:04:46.804 --> 01:04:49.517
What's up

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:52.766

01:04:52.767 --> 01:04:55.825
Fine! Now you come here?

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:59.476
Lately. There.

01:04:59.477 --> 01:05:02.079
Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.439
Begin? If we leave
Now, you make it.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.106
Where are you going

01:05:06.107 --> 01:05:07.619
It's our anniversary.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:10.011
Every time we go to see
a movie at Royal.

01:05:10.012 --> 01:05:12.335
Nicely.
Climb up, you go too.

01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:14.861
No, never mind.
We anticipate walk.

01:05:14.862 --> 01:05:17.250
- Are you serious?
- Yes, of course.

01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:19.939
I always wanted to climb
in one of them!

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.251
Perfect!

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:22.493

01:05:22.494 --> 01:05:25.678
Really, yes.
Come on, what are you doing? Come.

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:26.951

What are you doing? Through Bess.
What the heck?

01:05:37.831 --> 01:05:40.452
We'll go ride rickshaw!

01:05:40.453 --> 01:05:44.273

- A leptaki.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.536
- Congratulations.

01:05:46.537 --> 01:05:48.206
Thank you for everything.

01:05:48.207 --> 01:05:49.301
Are you ready?

01:05:49.302 --> 01:05:51.098
This is a historic moment.

01:05:51.099 --> 01:05:53.425
Okay, hold on.

01:05:53.426 --> 01:06:00.201
Hold on.

Thank you very much.
How many ...

01:06:58.955 --> 01:07:00.306
How much we owe you ...?

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.930
- It's on the house.
- No!

01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:06.146
Maybe with cherries
chicken, someday.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.295
Margo told you about ...

01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:11.480
Yes, of course.
Would like very much.

01:07:11.481 --> 01:07:13.596
I need a new audience.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:16.044
Margo has taken too
dose of chicken anymore.

01:07:16.045 --> 01:07:17.025
Not true.

01:07:17.026 --> 01:07:20.052
- Thank you very much.

01:07:20.053 --> 01:07:27.735

01:07:50.492 --> 01:07:55.450
Well ...

01:07:55.451 --> 01:08:00.312
Yes?

01:08:00.313 --> 01:08:03.656
How are things going?

01:08:03.657 --> 01:08:08.025
Merry. What do you mean?

01:08:08.026 --> 01:08:13.906
I mean ... I do not know ...

01:08:13.907 --> 01:08:17.337
Say something ...

01:08:17.339 --> 01:08:18.997
Why

01:08:18.999 --> 01:08:26.956
To open a conversation.

01:08:31.076 --> 01:08:37.618
I have to say something.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.309
This is a good sign.

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:43.716
I will not say anything, just
open to debate.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.738
Why not ask me how am I doing?

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.207
Because I know how you doing.
I do not know?

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:54.513
Yeah, I guess. Just ...

01:08:54.514 --> 01:08:56.234
You do not seem a bit strange,

01:08:56.234 --> 01:08:57.920
we sit here
without talking?

01:08:57.921 --> 01:09:00.002
And what can we say?

01:09:00.004 --> 01:09:04.174
We live together, we know everything
about each other.

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:07.090
Then what is the point
go out for dinner?

01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:10.227
To eat good food.

01:09:10.228 --> 01:09:13.224
To go to a beautiful place.

01:09:13.225 --> 01:09:21.152
Not to say our newsletter.

01:09:25.363 --> 01:09:29.979
Come here, come on.

01:09:29.981 --> 01:09:32.225
I love you.

01:09:32.225 --> 01:09:38.298
It is the anniversary
we love you.

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:42.761
Happy birthday.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:49.604
I love you.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.917
Hey.
Now who is watching whom?

01:10:50.466 --> 01:10:53.265
- I met my husband.
- Indeed.

01:10:53.266 --> 01:10:55.932
How was your anniversary?

01:10:55.933 --> 01:10:57.317
Was okay.

01:10:57.318 --> 01:10:59.974
Okay?

01:10:59.975 --> 01:11:04.481
Yes. It ...

01:11:04.482 --> 01:11:10.267
It is the most good and
polite person in the world.

01:11:10.302 --> 01:11:13.639
It seemed sweet.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.523
Seemed to be very loving.

01:11:16.524 --> 01:11:20.659
And I love him.

01:11:21.672 --> 01:11:24.449
This came to tell me?

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:28.653
You love your husband, and
The anniversary was okay?

01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:33.061
Why was it okay?

01:11:33.062 --> 01:11:35.041
I feel that there is no
greatest betrayal ...

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.986
From ... to complain
for my husband to ...

01:11:36.987 --> 01:11:43.655
In whom?

01:11:46.796 --> 01:11:49.779
Come take a ride.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:53.253
I want to go out in the world with you.
Can we?

01:11:53.254 --> 01:11:57.832
We can move
day together?

01:11:57.833 --> 01:11:59.935
Please?

01:11:59.936 --> 01:12:05.429
Yes.

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:11.936
Let's do it.

01:12:47.165 --> 01:12:52.776
Have you ever been to the Flyers
carts at amusement parks?

01:12:52.777 --> 01:12:54.675
It is dark and
play music ...

01:12:54.676 --> 01:13:03.457
Going ... and very quickly
to do something stupid.

01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:43.760
- See you.
- Sometime.

01:15:43.761 --> 01:15:51.949
- Soon.
- I guess.

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:34.792
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:45.430
- What will you do now?
- Nothing.

01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:49.441
You must do
something, not me.

01:16:49.847 --> 01:16:54.718
I gotta say it again, that
I'm in love with you?

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.957
I do not have it said before.

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:07.518
In this case ...

01:17:07.727 --> 01:17:13.449
In this case ...
Nothing?

01:17:23.759 --> 01:17:31.234
I can not!

01:17:37.136 --> 01:17:41.126
I can not ...

01:17:41.127 --> 01:17:49.812
I think we should
Now go home, Margo.

01:19:07.961 --> 01:19:12.775
- What?
- I do not know.

01:19:12.776 --> 01:19:19.562
These here ...

01:19:26.736 --> 01:19:28.499
I have blackheads?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.339
I woke up, and you know when you have
one that has just come out ...

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.885
And you can ...
to see it yet ...

01:19:34.886 --> 01:19:42.161
I think there is.

01:19:45.683 --> 01:19:52.429
I love you.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:57.978
The good thing of not being completely
dedicated to AA, is ...

01:19:57.979 --> 01:20:01.967
That ... friends and relatives, your
make a great party with drinks ...

01:20:01.968 --> 01:20:04.104
To celebrate ...
the poise you ...

01:20:04.105 --> 01:20:08.393
Which is ...
totally inappropriate ...

01:20:08.394 --> 01:20:11.101
And ... absolutely fantastic.
Well ...

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:13.808
Pick up the bottle ... about ...
(Carbonated water)

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.480
Cheers ... to all of you who
you can become a fez

01:20:16.481 --> 01:20:18.128
without guilt ...

01:20:18.129 --> 01:20:20.565
The imaginary brother ...
me and my sister ...

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:24.774
I brought ... more
a neat piece cake ...

01:20:24.775 --> 01:20:29.675
Wonderful ... to my children, who
is not here, Tony ...

01:20:29.676 --> 01:20:32.932
... I thank you for tolerating
the worst year ...

01:20:32.933 --> 01:20:37.175
And lovely ...
My husband, James ...

01:20:37.176 --> 01:20:43.443
James not to say?

01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:47.907
Who confided ... enough

01:20:47.908 --> 01:20:51.028
to be with
you drunk assholes.

01:20:51.029 --> 01:20:52.651
Enough of this shit ...

01:20:52.652 --> 01:21:01.260
Put your music ...
to dance, assholes!

01:21:23.414 --> 01:21:26.191
- Lou!
- Hey, I did not expect to come ...

01:21:26.192 --> 01:21:29.606
Lost ... why.
It was perfect.

01:21:29.607 --> 01:21:37.075
You ashtray? Fine.

01:21:38.731 --> 01:21:40.734
Come out of here, have a drink.

01:21:40.735 --> 01:21:44.155
- Never mind, I ...
- Come on!

01:21:44.156 --> 01:21:46.210
A drink!

01:21:46.211 --> 01:21:48.143
Basically I have a job ...

01:21:48.144 --> 01:21:52.120
It's Saturday night.
Be a good neighbor!

01:21:52.121 --> 01:21:57.550
Fuck!

01:21:57.551 --> 01:22:03.582
Merry.

01:23:17.151 --> 01:23:24.268
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

01:23:29.339 --> 01:23:30.743
You say hello to Daniel?

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:33.091
Yes, you can not imagine
whether he be persuaded to come.

01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:37.480
- Want some kebab?
- Yes, for the book.

01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:41.385
- To get no beer.
- Yes, they are out.

01:23:41.386 --> 01:23:42.684
- What do you think?
- Delicious!

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:48.829
Thank you.

01:23:54.039 --> 01:23:57.875
- Interesting choice!
- I tried not to come.

01:23:57.876 --> 01:23:59.218
He insisted much.

01:23:59.219 --> 01:24:06.219
Something tells me it could
to find an excuse.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.480
I was thinking that this fear
you got to airports.

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:16.018
Being in between ...

01:24:16.019 --> 01:24:20.744
I think me
I do not like.

01:24:20.745 --> 01:24:24.978
I know that it is in
nature of life, but ...

01:24:27.284 --> 01:24:32.400
D like to ... avoid,
where possible.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:39.494
I do not think I want to
I'm in between.

01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:46.232
You must go to the party.

01:24:46.233 --> 01:24:54.811
- You can stay as long as you want.
- I will not stay long.

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:20.398
You're leaving already?

01:25:20.399 --> 01:25:22.556
Good luck with
chicken, man.

01:25:22.557 --> 01:25:28.516
Thank you.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:26:00.752
August 5, 2040. 2.00-m m

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:58.884
Lou?

01:29:37.425 --> 01:29:41.462
I do not think ... I do not think ...

01:29:41.463 --> 01:29:47.713
Gosh, I do not know ...

01:29:49.716 --> 01:29:57.433
I thought you were
there when you die ...

01:30:09.914 --> 01:30:11.803
Do not say that!

01:30:11.804 --> 01:30:13.486
What the heck does that mean?

01:30:13.487 --> 01:30:18.307
I think somewhere I knew that
something was amiss, and ...

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:27.648
Just hoping ... that will
left alone.

01:30:29.352 --> 01:30:35.077
You are so beautiful!

01:30:35.078 --> 01:30:39.854
And I feel that
I never deserved ...

01:30:39.855 --> 01:30:46.015
No, no!

01:30:46.016 --> 01:30:49.187
I feel that ...

01:30:49.188 --> 01:30:54.735
I beg you ... if you stay,
will humiliate ...

01:30:57.706 --> 01:30:59.727
In high school I was with someone ...

01:30:59.728 --> 01:31:02.004
Lost ... one testicle
a hockey game ...

01:31:02.005 --> 01:31:05.839
And ... I'm sure that had
design very different life ...

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.337
From ... it finally did.

01:31:10.338 --> 01:31:17.121
At least I've
my testicles.

01:31:36.776 --> 01:31:40.192
Maybe you ought to have a bath.

01:31:40.193 --> 01:31:42.688
It makes you feel better.

01:31:42.689 --> 01:31:45.262
I do not want to bathe.

01:31:45.263 --> 01:31:48.319
Just ...

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:55.472
... Do me a favor, okay?

01:32:02.843 --> 01:32:04.483
You?

01:32:04.484 --> 01:32:07.102
Yes.

01:32:07.103 --> 01:32:11.594
- Every ...?
- Every day.

01:32:11.595 --> 01:32:12.550
There ...?

01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:14.434
No problem
water ...

01:32:14.435 --> 01:32:17.771
Or ... something has to be corrected
I just thought ...

01:32:17.772 --> 01:32:20.578
One day I'll tell the Margo ...

01:32:20.579 --> 01:32:22.300
That ... I do
throughout her life ...

01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:26.274
And ... will make you laugh.

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:32.692
It's funny "long-term".

01:32:32.693 --> 01:32:41.271
RETURN ON HEARING:
CALAMITY JANE

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:49.929

Go.

01:33:26.694 --> 01:33:31.738
Fuck.

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:37.513
Go.

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:51.238
Here you are.

01:39:25.874 --> 01:39:31.400
I love you.

01:39:31.401 --> 01:39:38.034
I love you!

01:39:39.338 --> 01:39:45.184
I love you.

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:34.267
"He chicken flavor."

01:40:53.849 --> 01:40:56.593
Glad we did not expect.

01:40:56.594 --> 01:41:02.500
Me too.

01:41:27.935 --> 01:41:34.057
Hello?

01:41:50.014 --> 01:41:52.267
- Hi.
- Hey, Margo.

01:41:52.268 --> 01:41:54.571
The Tony wanted to tell
"Hello" Say "hello", Tony.

01:41:54.572 --> 01:42:00.935
Hey!

01:42:01.567 --> 01:42:03.862
In pethymisa, theioula Margo.

01:42:03.863 --> 01:42:06.992
And I in pethymisa.

01:42:06.993 --> 01:42:14.600
Okay, now we
I'm going to eat, bye.

01:42:16.761 --> 01:42:18.632
Goodbye.

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:23.541
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:42:23.542 --> 01:42:28.422
The Geraldine disappeared, and
Tony is left alone ...

01:42:28.423 --> 01:42:29.828
For hours ... ...

01:42:29.829 --> 01:42:32.173
James shouted ...
the police ...

01:42:32.174 --> 01:42:35.582
Say ... and will go
within a few hours ...

01:42:35.583 --> 01:42:38.095
I do not know what
I here ...

01:42:38.096 --> 01:42:45.326
I do not think
I stay ...

01:42:50.317 --> 01:42:54.529
My God ...

01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:57.539
- Madam Verok ...
- Okay, one leptaki ...

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.234
Madam, we would like to
join us.

01:42:59.235 --> 01:43:01.079
Jerry, you must go
with him, okay?

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.046
One minute.

01:43:02.047 --> 01:43:03.908
Geraldine, go
with them, darling.

01:43:03.909 --> 01:43:05.541
We'll be here when you get back.

01:43:05.542 --> 01:43:08.305
Okay, one leptaki, Mom.

01:43:08.306 --> 01:43:11.582
Look, James, I got birds.

01:43:11.583 --> 01:43:16.150
It takes ... milk. I think ...

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.021
What

01:43:18.022 --> 01:43:20.577
For Tony, I got to
Shop pets.

01:43:20.578 --> 01:43:22.655
There is ...

01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:25.499
Margo!

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.316
You're back?

01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:28.942
- I missed you!
- Okay, lady.

01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:30.362
I have a leptaki?

01:43:30.363 --> 01:43:33.546
I need to talk
this lady.

01:43:33.547 --> 01:43:39.494
Let's go.

01:43:44.652 --> 01:43:47.679
What are you doing?

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.021
I want to see you too long.

01:43:51.022 --> 01:43:53.494
Too long.

01:43:53.495 --> 01:43:56.864
This needs to
back? What're you doing?

01:43:56.865 --> 01:43:59.411
What happened, Geraldine?

01:43:59.412 --> 01:44:02.916
I am an alcoholic, stupid.
Nothing happened.

01:44:02.917 --> 01:44:05.810
This is the normal
my situation.

01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:11.761
What happened ... seriously?

01:44:11.949 --> 01:44:16.637
Why should not I ask you?
You disappeared, just like that.

01:44:16.638 --> 01:44:19.410
What an obvious move, damn it!

01:44:19.411 --> 01:44:23.466
Do you believe that everything can be solved
if you do just the right move?

01:44:23.717 --> 01:44:25.526
It should be exciting.

01:44:25.527 --> 01:44:28.209
I think it is exciting.

01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:32.328
I do not agree.

01:44:32.329 --> 01:44:35.137
Do not! Do not do it.

01:44:35.138 --> 01:44:38.894
I bring you in
embarrassed? Ego?

01:44:38.895 --> 01:44:42.687
You know I do
same thing here, damn it?

01:44:42.688 --> 01:44:44.669
I do not understand what
trying to say.

01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:49.035
I think you're more
silly me.

01:44:49.036 --> 01:44:52.705
I think you're really
very confused, Margo.

01:44:52.706 --> 01:44:56.586
In the general picture ...

01:44:56.587 --> 01:45:00.205
Life is empty and no
we are just us.

01:45:00.206 --> 01:45:05.882
Do not go crazy to
fillings, like no daredevil.

01:45:05.883 --> 01:45:08.537
I must go, damn.

01:45:08.538 --> 01:45:13.889
Okay, let's go.

01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:17.598
It was fun.

01:45:17.599 --> 01:45:19.361
It's hard to talk ...

01:45:19.362 --> 01:45:21.824
Honestly ... with people
when you have not drunk ...

01:45:21.825 --> 01:45:24.164
Thing ... I'm sure
you can imagine, Captain.

01:45:24.165 --> 01:45:26.028
Jumped last
no harlot?

01:45:26.029 --> 01:45:29.353
- Break any head?
- Get in the car, please.

01:45:29.354 --> 01:45:31.308
You see, it's fun.

01:45:31.309 --> 01:45:37.418
I will drive?

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.918
Sorry.

01:46:00.919 --> 01:46:03.325
The Tony wanted in here, and
I did not know what to do ...

01:46:03.326 --> 01:46:06.161
Jerry ... and in
had pethymisei.

01:46:06.162 --> 01:46:07.923
No, no, never mind.

01:46:07.924 --> 01:46:10.158
I should have phoned.

01:46:10.159 --> 01:46:13.836
We just do not know what to say.

01:46:13.837 --> 01:46:20.255
It is difficult to
You know, I guess.

01:46:24.286 --> 01:46:26.267
How are you?

01:46:26.268 --> 01:46:29.639
Merry. Basically, unexpectedly ...

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.466
Finally ... ... All right.

01:46:33.467 --> 01:46:35.472
In the book you
went very well.

01:46:35.473 --> 01:46:37.282
Really, did you see?
Thanks, I know.

01:46:37.283 --> 01:46:39.558
Who would expect that like
both the chicken in the world?

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:42.555
And with so many
ways of cooking.

01:46:42.556 --> 01:46:45.531
We'll see how it goes
the second book.

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.103
You write the second book?

01:46:47.104 --> 01:46:50.108
No, do not be silly.

01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:52.946
It is for the hens N.
Guinea and pheasants.

01:46:52.947 --> 01:47:00.316
- Yes?
- No, idiot.

01:47:17.203 --> 01:47:20.912
How is your life?

01:47:20.913 --> 01:47:25.530
- You mean if I go with no?
- No!

01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:29.822
I do not want to ... Yes.

01:47:29.823 --> 01:47:32.503
Sometimes.

01:47:32.504 --> 01:47:38.989
No, actually not.

01:47:44.097 --> 01:47:52.731
Do you ever think ...?

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.314
No, I think not.

01:47:55.315 --> 01:48:01.393
I think not.

01:48:01.394 --> 01:48:06.297
You said that there
going out with no ...

01:48:06.298 --> 01:48:14.537
Some things you do
in your life, much ...

01:48:21.647 --> 01:48:23.685
- Sorry ...
- There is no reason to be sad ...

01:48:23.686 --> 01:48:27.211
... How can you be sad because
you did what you had to do?

01:48:27.212 --> 01:48:27.963
But I did not think that ...

01:48:27.964 --> 01:48:30.396
We did not do it
this discussion ...

01:48:30.397 --> 01:48:33.641
Frankly I do not care ...
to do now.

01:48:33.642 --> 01:48:39.497
Naturally. Sorry. Got it.

01:48:39.498 --> 01:48:45.693
I'm sorry too.

01:48:46.077 --> 01:48:48.962
Will me, if I
to do something for Tony,

01:48:48.963 --> 01:48:52.270
or Jerry or ... for you?

01:48:52.271 --> 01:48:56.882
Yes, I think we
we are okay.

01:48:56.883 --> 01:48:58.008
Goodbye.

01:48:58.009 --> 01:49:03.899
Goodbye.

01:49:08.649 --> 01:49:10.163
Margo!

01:49:10.164 --> 01:49:13.108
Yes.

01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:15.655
I just bought a machine
make melon balls ...

01:49:15.656 --> 01:49:20.254
And ... I'd like to
I take out the eyes with it.

01:49:20.255 --> 01:49:26.827
Yeah, me too.

01:49:27.647 --> 01:49:33.583
Bye, Margo.

01:49:34.557 --> 01:49:41.172
Goodbye, Lou.0
