17:45.118 --> 17:48.158
These are a bit like a date.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.158

Is not it awesome in cannabis, THC substance?

17:59.238 --> 18:03.448

18:03.538 --> 18:07.878
He lives in a dormitory on the other side of campus.

18:10.318 --> 18:14.048
And I thought that chivalry is dead.

18:16.229 --> 18:20.399
Thank you could you take me home. See you tomorrow at the lab.

18:20.479 --> 18:22.529
Bye.

18:30.389 --> 18:33.739
I do not even know your name.

18:37.169 --> 18:41.769
Rigo Fabian, vuosikurssi 1985.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.069
"Kemianopiskelija
Rigo Fabian kuoli" -

18:51.160 --> 18:54.720
"Doing laboratory experiments with Pierre Avon."

18:54.810 --> 18:57.110
Flowers?

18:57.200 --> 18:59.850
Dr. Avon!

19:11.790 --> 19:14.360

19:14.440 --> 19:18.790

Doctor!

19:23.440 --> 19:26.820
- He brought me home. - Did he escape from here?

19:26.911 --> 19:31.211
- So you know him. Rigo! - Shh!

19:32.261 --> 19:35.121
All right, I'll tell you.

19:35.211 --> 19:38.601
- But do not breathlessly here. - I can keep my mouth shut.

19:38.691 --> 19:41.551
Can you?

19:42.771 --> 19:47.331
We have to go back to -

19:47.421 --> 19:53.411
The year of the Lord 1985.

19:54.761 --> 19:59.241
Rigo was the best student of mine. He helped develop the machine -

19:59.321 --> 20:02.751
which extend human life.

20:04.282 --> 20:06.452
He was like my own son.

20:06.532 --> 20:11.662
He was so dedicated to his head for mixing -

20:11.752 --> 20:14.792
that developed its own cannabis variety.

20:14.882 --> 20:21.832
It was so strong that Romero came to the cloud exposure to smoke.

20:21.912 --> 20:24.822
Awesome!

20:24.912 --> 20:29.992
I did not know that Rigo was also a pothead.

20:30.042 --> 20:34.122
Bongimestari. Hatsis maksimus.

20:34.212 --> 20:39.072
Jointtijätkä. Dr. Ruohonen.

20:39.163 --> 20:43.553
One evening, Rigo was around the cloud -

20:43.643 --> 20:48.553
and thought zombikonetta dorm jet.

20:49.813 --> 20:56.413
The device was launched, and then began to happen.

20:56.453 --> 21:03.063
Marijuana mixed with Rigon DNA and caused a chemical reaction.

21:03.143 --> 21:06.323
The best pupils became ...

21:08.363 --> 21:12.663
- A zombie. - And her cat, too.

21:12.743 --> 21:16.003
Romero jumped into the plane at the last moment.

21:16.054 --> 21:18.524
But Rigo's really cute.

21:18.614 --> 21:23.134
Of course! Marijuana mixed with hybrid DNA -

21:23.214 --> 21:26.654
to keep her strong and young.

21:26.734 --> 21:31.904
Buns your searches Chrissy.

21:37.734 --> 21:40.164
You do not smell the dead.

21:40.204 --> 21:44.074
Is that kurpitsapiiraan fragrance?

21:44.114 --> 21:49.894
It is a blend of nutmeg, cinnamon and Old spice.

21:49.985 --> 21:55.415
I got the recipe many years ago when I dated Julia Childs.

21:55.495 --> 21:59.105
Rigon substance is injected into the sebaceous glands.

21:59.195 --> 22:03.625
On both sides. He is a neat young man.

22:03.715 --> 22:08.015
He used floss after every meal.

22:08.055 --> 22:11.225
Have you ever bitten anyone?

22:11.315 --> 22:15.915
One of the very unfortunate incident -

22:16.005 --> 22:20.175
occurred in a nightclub in 1986.

22:22.735 --> 22:28.295
It was Christmas Eve, and Rigo went to a nightclub.

22:28.386 --> 22:31.426
Young woman cast her eyes on him -

22:31.516 --> 22:35.946
and wrapped him captivated. Rigo bit the woman.

22:36.036 --> 22:40.466
Woman bitten someone else, and everyone started to bite each other -

22:40.556 --> 22:45.726
until the nightclub was full of zombies.

22:47.676 --> 22:51.496
The new wave of music died because of Rigon -

22:51.586 --> 22:55.286
and he no longer afraid to go out.

22:55.326 --> 22:59.716
He is afraid of purevansa someone, if nervous.

22:59.796 --> 23:04.056
So he lives here.

23:04.147 --> 23:06.797
Does he eat people?

23:06.877 --> 23:10.747
No, only in laboratory rats.

23:10.837 --> 23:15.787
But they will die anyway.

23:15.877 --> 23:18.697
Marijuana is the decisive factor.

23:18.787 --> 23:22.917
It dilutes Rigon blood lust.

23:22.997 --> 23:27.037
Whenever he makes a mind to indulge in -

23:27.087 --> 23:33.037
he gets raw chopped liver. It's his favorite food.

23:33.077 --> 23:36.597
But he is so endearing.

23:36.687 --> 23:39.687
Oh my God, this is terrible!

23:39.768 --> 23:44.068
Are you off the upset simply because he is dead?

23:44.158 --> 23:47.808
It does not matter whether he is a zombie. He is not the sort of brotherhood.

23:47.898 --> 23:51.978
If I do not find the kind of brotherhood in the next 24 hours -

23:52.068 --> 23:55.108
I lose my scholarship.

23:55.198 --> 23:58.017
My heart, I would already be lost.

23:58.018 --> 24:00.148
If not, then ...

24:03.748 --> 24:09.138
Chrissy! I do not wait to get rid of this.

24:09.228 --> 24:13.958
For the cream on one condition.

24:16.829 --> 24:21.699
What is the face of that effort?

24:24.479 --> 24:29.909
Huhuu? Texts, texts.

24:29.999 --> 24:34.769
Ladies and gentlemen, here speaks Professor Hagfish.

24:34.859 --> 24:41.069
I have important things to notice in this week's events -

24:41.159 --> 24:44.769
Ziering University.

24:46.159 --> 24:49.419
Vilkaistaan ​​rooms.

24:55.150 --> 24:56.930
It's perfect.

24:57.020 --> 25:00.360
The first event is -

25:00.410 --> 25:05.620
be the second annual lingerie running.

25:10.400 --> 25:16.920
Dismantled clothing will be donated to charity.

25:44.761 --> 25:49.071
And then the annual beauty contest.

25:49.151 --> 25:52.981
The winner will receive -

25:53.061 --> 25:58.971
kaksitehoruiskeen Dr. Daniels, a plastic surgeon's office.

25:59.061 --> 26:01.921
I participated in the races themselves.

26:08.012 --> 26:12.792
It is a pathetic case is finally gone.

26:12.872 --> 26:18.042
Will Chrissy still my lesson and he gives a hand treatments?

26:18.132 --> 26:21.432
I do not. And then put it back.

26:21.522 --> 26:26.342
- I do not. You know the rules. - I want to introduce one person.

26:27.562 --> 26:30.602
- He's talking to himself again. - Come on in.

26:39.683 --> 26:42.423
- What the fuck? - This is the Rigo Fabian.

26:42.503 --> 26:48.063
The newest member of ZBE Brotherhood and my boyfriend.

26:49.063 --> 26:52.713
That dude needs the sun.

26:59.193 --> 27:05.053
Votes are given, and the school's cutest couple is -

27:05.143 --> 27:12.873
Christina Chrysantemum
ja Rigo Fabian.

28:23.085 --> 28:28.995
"ZBE is now the most popular Brotherhood Ziering University's history."

28:29.036 --> 28:33.076
I look like a real molopäältä.

28:33.116 --> 28:38.286
It is time to put an end to this power couple.

28:38.336 --> 28:43.716
- Fuck them! - Do not annoy me.

28:43.806 --> 28:47.626
We have to manipulate Rigon and Chrissy nut.

28:47.716 --> 28:54.756
Tein kannabiksella
höystettyjä suklaapaloja.

28:54.846 --> 28:59.276
Chrissy will be so high on drugs that will do what we want.

28:59.356 --> 29:03.096
As to deceive Rigoa.

29:07.487 --> 29:11.487
- Grow your cock and fuck me. - I'm trying.

29:11.567 --> 29:15.347
Like marry paahtopaistileipää, with molten cheese.

29:15.437 --> 29:18.867
- 1, 2! 1, 2! - I'm inside.

29:18.957 --> 29:22.127
I am inside.

29:22.217 --> 29:25.607
Please wait ... MOLO forever and ever!

29:25.687 --> 29:28.987
That it took something like two minutes.

29:29.077 --> 29:32.377
Two minutes? It is a personal record.

29:34.337 --> 29:39.377
Drop alkkarinne in the name of charity.

29:40.418 --> 29:43.938
The race will start in five minutes.

29:48.978 --> 29:54.498
- This is an underwear running. - I do not wear underwear.

29:54.578 --> 29:57.358
Oh yeah. Neither do I.

30:19.819 --> 30:24.599
Who is ready to suck and blow the game?

30:29.899 --> 30:32.729
- I liked that. - It was a dirty trick.

30:32.809 --> 30:37.809
Today eaten delicacies. Congratulations söpöimmälle pair.

30:39.899 --> 30:44.329
- Are not you jealous? - Why would I be jealous of you?

30:44.419 --> 30:47.109
Cut up these chocolate pieces.

30:47.199 --> 30:53.839
Introduce me houses, Rigo. It was an architecture magazine.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.010
- But ... - Shh!

30:56.100 --> 30:59.580
- You are now the GM with the EU. - I do not want to be.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.440
Although the name is Bambi ...

31:17.390 --> 31:20.430
Im called "rancid Temmelsääreksi".

31:20.520 --> 31:24.080
Chocolate is a natural anti-oxidants ...

31:24.120 --> 31:26.640
- Chrissy?
- No?

31:30.641 --> 31:33.031
Bring your tastes seepranpaskalta.

31:37.241 --> 31:42.501
Wait Rigo! I'm really sorry.

31:42.591 --> 31:45.671
You are fucking hard.

31:48.801 --> 31:50.971
Come back.

31:51.061 --> 31:54.841
The third installment, now let's go.

31:54.931 --> 31:59.141
You do not have to be stoned to want this body.

31:59.231 --> 32:02.661
And you're at it, except my ex.

32:04.052 --> 32:08.872
I now have a new man, and you two are quite different.

32:12.612 --> 32:19.172
Whoops! They are not there. Do not worry, I eat pills.

32:19.262 --> 32:23.252
Did you sleep with Bambi?

32:28.032 --> 32:35.162
- Stop that poked in. - For the full pyllysi wounds.

32:35.242 --> 32:39.462
- Get your hands off, PJ! - Are you going to hit? Do it!

32:39.543 --> 32:44.763
Calm down. High noradrenaline and cortisol ...

32:44.843 --> 32:49.063
Be quiet! It makes you want to hit your face up.

32:50.153 --> 32:53.233
What's new record attendance today, dude?

32:55.103 --> 32:57.533
What are you going to do? Bite me?

32:57.623 --> 33:04.133
- Are you going to hit me? - Rigo need to calm down.

33:04.223 --> 33:07.653
Does that guy pulls a cloud before a fight?

33:09.873 --> 33:12.263
10 seconds left.

33:12.353 --> 33:16.653
- Do not condescend to this, Rigo. - Do it!

33:16.734 --> 33:19.954
- You do not know what he can do. - X, X, Y.

33:20.034 --> 33:23.774
Come on, albiinomulkero.

33:23.864 --> 33:26.774
Anna tulla! Pure!

33:34.854 --> 33:38.114
Huutakaa B! Huutakaa I!

33:38.204 --> 33:42.764
Huutakaa B! Huutakaa...

33:42.804 --> 33:46.234
- What am I tavasin? - Your name.

33:47.624 --> 33:51.794
- It is two letters. - It is hell your name!

33:51.885 --> 33:54.965
- Give me a break. - You're right.

33:55.055 --> 33:58.145
Bibi!

33:58.225 --> 34:01.055
Are you ready?

34:01.135 --> 34:06.225
3, 2, run!

34:15.085 --> 34:17.435
What are we going to do?

34:17.514 --> 34:20.425
I think I should run.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.905
What the fuck did you do?

34:31.076 --> 34:34.596
Are you okay, PJ?

34:42.846 --> 34:46.146
No problem, let's get you Dr. Avon creates.

34:49.235 --> 34:51.446
Where's the goat's food is?

34:56.226 --> 35:02.006
My neck! Please help!

35:02.046 --> 35:08.476
Please help! Blood burst into the point.

35:19.647 --> 35:23.947
I removed the price tags, so that I could return the suit.

35:23.987 --> 35:28.987
Fucking ZBE-boys and their stupid bileensä.

35:29.077 --> 35:33.417
Fuck off it. And the smell fuck you too.

35:36.457 --> 35:39.287
- Did someone say the V-word? - Do not come here.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.758
Brotherhood of the houses are over there!

36:29.509 --> 36:33.809
How's it going, PJ?

37:19.990 --> 37:23.900
Zombie virus is an insane sociological side-effect!

37:23.990 --> 37:30.120
They might be monsters, but they are still students.

37:30.161 --> 37:35.021
They will continue the same stupid örvellystä -

37:35.071 --> 37:39.111
and socially bold use than when human beings.

37:42.931 --> 37:47.361
We do not have to worry as long as they feel comfortable.

37:49.451 --> 37:53.051
They just do not get to leave the house.

37:56.701 --> 37:59.141
What is that?

38:00.871 --> 38:03.131
Oh gosh!

38:10.652 --> 38:15.252
Go away! Do not come here.

38:17.302 --> 38:20.732
Go away!

38:23.512 --> 38:25.942
Get out of here.

38:50.753 --> 38:52.623
Die, mulkero.

39:54.355 --> 39:58.185
Do not touch these. My grandfather paid them.

40:09.395 --> 40:12.045
Thank you, sweetie.

40:12.085 --> 40:14.865
Use this as a weapon, Bunny.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.385
I fucked zombies. Pull your hand!

40:23.165 --> 40:26.855
Show tissisi, Becky!

40:26.945 --> 40:30.115
Zombies may death of my chest means.

40:30.206 --> 40:33.246
I promise that it will work!

40:35.196 --> 40:37.626
That's it.

40:45.056 --> 40:48.056
Tits!

40:49.446 --> 40:53.926
Return to KY-house, and do not let anyone inside.

41:02.306 --> 41:05.996
We have to go KY-house.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.347
They come.

41:14.817 --> 41:18.387
Oh, my God!

41:18.467 --> 41:21.727
What the hell is that?

41:21.817 --> 41:24.247
They do not stop.

41:27.027 --> 41:31.417
What the hell is going on here?

41:31.507 --> 41:35.497
- The doors must be kept locked. - Oh, my God!

41:35.587 --> 41:41.977
No one is locked out. Out to celebrate it.

41:43.148 --> 41:47.318
Do you realize how much you complain of boredom?

41:47.408 --> 41:51.268
Do you realize how embarrassed you are?

41:53.058 --> 42:00.088
What now? Is pimppini really big?

42:00.178 --> 42:04.998
Perhaps the Sandvich leave residues, as pimppini is so big.

42:05.048 --> 42:11.518
Eat me, if you are going to just stand there with open mouth.

42:11.608 --> 42:14.298
Eat me!

42:29.979 --> 42:33.239
Oh, my God!

42:33.329 --> 42:36.369
We have to apply for Spike.

42:36.459 --> 42:41.669
What's the matter, honey? This is ruohosi. Calm down.

42:41.759 --> 42:44.409
You're better than the others.

42:44.489 --> 42:48.799
You are my hero. You saved me, and you can save again.

42:48.879 --> 42:51.139
Let's go!

43:05.000 --> 43:08.910
Be A safety measures, so as not to fall prey to the zombies.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.120
Do not move in areas that have had attacks.

43:20.810 --> 43:22.990
Mene it.

44:09.172 --> 44:14.952
- Call for help, a professor of Hagfish. - Do you smoke marijuana, young man?

44:15.952 --> 44:19.122
- You have to get out of here. - Not have to.

44:19.202 --> 44:25.202
You have to go to the library, if someone's got to do something.

44:25.292 --> 44:27.632
Or reputanko you?

44:30.332 --> 44:33.462
The library? Oh, my God!

44:33.502 --> 44:36.842
Morons.

44:42.233 --> 44:45.583
- Zombies are coming! - Shh.

44:45.663 --> 44:52.273
- Zombies are coming from. - Do they have a visitor badge?

44:54.053 --> 44:59.613
I dislike cramming for exams. I wish I could cram this information kallooni.

45:39.014 --> 45:41.014
Rigo?

45:55.095 --> 45:57.395
Rigo!

45:58.565 --> 46:01.085
Rigo?

46:54.136 --> 46:58.916
Adolf! Is that a student's car?

46:59.006 --> 47:04.386
Can you look at, whether in the center console coins?

47:06.477 --> 47:10.257
Or chewing gum?

47:11.557 --> 47:16.427
Or maybe a soda?

47:16.507 --> 47:19.547
- Yes. - Does not it?

47:19.637 --> 47:21.937
Good evening, then.

47:32.847 --> 47:35.537
Huhuu?

48:09.948 --> 48:14.378
I am so close to vakivirkaa that I can taste it.

48:23.029 --> 48:25.809
Who's there?

48:25.899 --> 48:27.849
Huhuu?

48:34.929 --> 48:37.449
Imagination gallops.

48:39.749 --> 48:44.449
Tell me now.

48:44.529 --> 48:47.659
Stop it, boys.

48:47.749 --> 48:51.269
You can not do this.

48:51.349 --> 48:54.129
This is an abuse of the elderly.

48:54.179 --> 48:56.479
Who are you ...?

49:10.820 --> 49:13.340
Oh no! Too late.

49:17.730 --> 49:19.940
Spike?

49:22.630 --> 49:27.540
- Spike? - Bye, Systeri.

49:28.930 --> 49:31.800
- Take this. - You are right.

49:31.891 --> 49:35.101
Loistokondiksessa. These are my friends.

49:41.101 --> 49:45.051
They're not your friends. They are zombies.

49:45.141 --> 49:47.621
What?

49:51.351 --> 49:53.441
And no.

49:55.091 --> 49:57.521
Pizzatoimitus.

49:57.611 --> 50:00.171
It makes 7.50.

50:00.261 --> 50:03.171
Are you going to pay for it?

50:06.381 --> 50:10.511
Let's say that you're right.

50:10.602 --> 50:13.292
- What we do? - Let's get out.

50:13.382 --> 50:17.682
Let's get out before they become munchies.

50:17.772 --> 50:20.332
- I'll mess grasses. - Leave them!

50:20.422 --> 50:22.812
I paid good money for these.

50:32.582 --> 50:36.582
- Come on, Rigo! - I think he'll be fine.

50:36.672 --> 50:39.322
No.

50:47.223 --> 50:50.443
- What now? - Oh, Jesus!

50:54.353 --> 50:57.953
- It does not let go. - I'll help.

50:58.043 --> 51:01.693
This is not Kentucky.

51:04.383 --> 51:09.943
- To get you to a doctor. - But I'm so young!

51:10.033 --> 51:12.813
To the hospital. You're gonna be all right.

51:12.903 --> 51:17.553
Chrissy, käsi...

51:17.633 --> 51:19.893
It fucked me with his finger.

51:28.024 --> 51:30.754
Come on.

51:30.844 --> 51:34.884
The last competitor Swimsuit Competition is -

51:34.974 --> 51:39.364
neiti Honey St. Bunny.

51:45.314 --> 51:48.704
Bunny is ... a devout carnivore.

51:48.784 --> 51:53.434
He likes long, dark, and dead men.

51:54.524 --> 52:01.034
He appreciates lover, who looks soft side.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.645
Especially insides.

52:03.735 --> 52:07.775
- Women ... - Get out before we noticed.

52:09.905 --> 52:14.035
Next, it's time for a question and answer section.

52:14.075 --> 52:18.375
Miss Bambi Häränpalli.

52:28.585 --> 52:32.795
Famine is an ongoing problem.

52:32.886 --> 52:35.796
What is your solution to it?

52:47.446 --> 52:50.226
Good good.

53:21.717 --> 53:25.197
Nurse Escandalo?

53:25.237 --> 53:28.457
Did we come at a bad time?

53:39.487 --> 53:44.177
And this is happening at service stations toilets.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.958
Come on.

53:53.608 --> 53:56.348
What's the matter?

53:58.738 --> 54:01.868
Yeah, my ass is the zombie's hand.

54:01.948 --> 54:05.078
You have received a valuable lesson.

54:05.168 --> 54:08.908
Now I know where the prostate is.

54:10.078 --> 54:12.288
Let's get you in shape.

54:12.378 --> 54:15.458
- Outside, there are zombies ... - A nice story.

54:15.548 --> 54:20.498
I'll take care of one crisis at a time, and now it is your friend's hand in my ass.

54:20.549 --> 54:23.199
There is talk of salts later.

54:25.499 --> 54:28.369
Rigo! Are you okay?

54:30.059 --> 54:34.709
Oh no! Do not Cry.

54:36.149 --> 54:40.789
I know that the intention was not to cause all of this.

54:40.879 --> 54:44.489
You just lost your temper.

54:47.219 --> 54:50.349
I too have lost my temper.

54:50.439 --> 54:56.089
I told the age of five to the mother that I would microscope.

54:56.170 --> 55:02.080
When he did not buy it, I said that I did not want to see him anymore.

55:02.130 --> 55:06.470
He died that night, a hand massage device in an accident.

55:07.690 --> 55:11.510
I can not ever ask for forgiveness from my mother.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.980
But of this we can fix it.

55:16.030 --> 55:19.760
We can make things better footing.

55:21.280 --> 55:24.760
You Rigo!

55:24.850 --> 55:28.450
- That came in handy. - How can you think about sex?

55:29.540 --> 55:32.490
It was a medical procedure.

55:32.581 --> 55:36.531
- I have to go back to the lab. - Two henkosta yet.

55:36.621 --> 55:42.961
There must be some way to change the zombies back into humans.

55:43.051 --> 55:46.311
Last Stressasin saw a lot of exam week.

55:47.391 --> 55:51.741
Contact this. You long for something more relaxing.

55:58.781 --> 56:01.861
Every fourth student has chlamydia.

56:01.951 --> 56:07.731
"College student is ..." Gonorrhea?

56:10.512 --> 56:13.292
That it is the answer!

56:13.332 --> 56:18.332
- Gonorrhea? Tell it to them. - I know how zombies are changed.

56:19.982 --> 56:22.192
We gotta get out.

56:22.282 --> 56:26.062
Maybe they do not want me, if I acquired a sexually transmitted disease.

56:26.152 --> 56:29.802
I'm not that kind of girl.

56:29.882 --> 56:33.402
What should I do so that I could get gonorrhea?

56:38.142 --> 56:41.272
Pull naked before the zombies come.

56:41.312 --> 56:44.832
What are you doing? You are not gay.

56:44.923 --> 56:51.823
Cut off the hand fucked me with his finger. I can go on until the end.

56:53.743 --> 56:57.653
Let's escape through the back door!

57:02.293 --> 57:04.383
I do not want to die.

57:17.113 --> 57:20.023
Do not kill me.

57:27.934 --> 57:30.584
Do not eat it, please.

57:45.174 --> 57:49.214
If this works, I apply for postgraduate studies.

57:49.304 --> 57:53.434
I can not wait, I can tell that Dr. Avon.

57:53.524 --> 57:55.604
Dr. Avon?

57:58.955 --> 58:02.905
Dr. Avon!

58:11.155 --> 58:13.505
Dr. Avon?

58:15.065 --> 58:18.155
Do not shoot or move around.

58:24.235 --> 58:28.145
Scared so that the fire clays lahkeeseen.

58:28.235 --> 58:31.755
- Where is the toilet? - Over there.

58:31.795 --> 58:34.965
Jesus, what a day.

58:35.056 --> 58:40.006
- Do you know what my problem is? - Kynsinauhakrampit?

58:40.096 --> 58:46.566
To complicate things too much. Can you shut the door kropallasi?

58:46.656 --> 58:50.956
I know how to improve zombivirus.

58:51.046 --> 58:58.556
The elastic film is too thick, a command to keep the cell to relax.

58:59.646 --> 59:01.726
Pilveni!

59:01.816 --> 59:07.766
For this reason, soothing marijuana to suppress Rigon blood lust.

59:07.856 --> 59:10.986
But how do you get the drug from the cloud?

59:11.077 --> 59:17.637
If the virus spreads through the saliva, why I'm not a zombie?

59:17.677 --> 59:21.417
I have changed a lot of spit with Rigon -

59:21.497 --> 59:25.587
and other bodily fluids, by mutual consent.

59:25.667 --> 59:29.277
Why I am not a zombie?

59:29.367 --> 59:33.357
- You gave me too much information. - Read my lips.

59:33.447 --> 59:35.657
Literally.

59:35.747 --> 59:40.357
The answer is meikkimallistoni. I thought Preparatory something pretty -

59:40.437 --> 59:44.697
but took particular huuliini hyaluronic acid and peptide B3 -

59:44.788 --> 59:48.348
with oat bran and wheat germ.

59:48.438 --> 59:54.478
Together with the marijuana they prevent the zombie virus spread -

59:54.558 --> 59:58.728
and turn their symptoms on their heads.

01:00:04.858 --> 01:00:09.468
- Are you sure that it works? - There is only one way to find it.

01:00:10.728 --> 01:00:12.898
Bring me a zombie.

01:00:16.498 --> 01:00:19.628
I hope this works.

01:00:27.839 --> 01:00:31.879
A key ingredient Meikkimallistoni is estrogen.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:44.609
- I'm sexy. - Physical education teachers.

01:00:44.699 --> 01:00:47.389
Correct the thing, Chrissy.

01:00:47.479 --> 01:00:52.999
I need to make estrogen-secreting hormones into non-toxic -

01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:58.469
so that I can refute gender reassignment process.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.160
Spike! Go to watch the door.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:04.820
The bolt that no more zombies get inside.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.070
We need to fix the thing -

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:16.370
or all the students look from the Russian female gymnasts from whom.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.930
Okay, I'm trying to think.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.890
- Think faster! - I'm trying.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:34.010
- Brad?
- Olen nyt Brad Lee Ann.

01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:40.961
Herpes has disappeared completely. It is the answer!

01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:44.311
Marijuana soothing properties -

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:48.781
and the development of anti-herpes are the perfect combination.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:56.991
This may have an adverse reaction to Botulism or suffering from polio.

01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:04.681
- Dr. Avon? - What?

01:02:05.861 --> 01:02:08.071
Search Romero.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.882
It worked.

01:02:29.052 --> 01:02:32.662
Used in serum Rigoon -

01:02:32.702 --> 01:02:37.572
so that he can help us to fight against zombies.

01:02:41.002 --> 01:02:43.392
All right.

01:02:43.482 --> 01:02:46.132
To paskiainen?

01:02:46.223 --> 01:02:49.783
The body fucked me today with his finger.

01:02:49.863 --> 01:02:53.903
Suosikkihousuissani
on paskatahroja.

01:02:53.993 --> 01:02:59.163
And all the good ruohoni is at the end -

01:02:59.253 --> 01:03:03.773
because you haisevahengityksiset and keskustelukyvyttömät -

01:03:03.853 --> 01:03:09.373
you do not PREVENT Santa, even though you paid for it.

01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:16.103
Who among you will replace this stuff?

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.884
I thought so. Implement smell.

01:03:34.314 --> 01:03:38.574
A as orange, B as the bazaar.

01:03:38.654 --> 01:03:42.524
And I'm a tiger, to whom Siegfried & Roy lost.

01:03:45.434 --> 01:03:51.644
Spray you Rigoa agent. Is not this what you have wanted.

01:03:51.734 --> 01:03:57.644
- Change him back into a human. - Do you love me as man?

01:03:57.735 --> 01:04:00.855
I am in my love for you?

01:04:06.545 --> 01:04:10.595
What are you waiting for, Chrissy?

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:35.045
Damn! It was good stuff.

01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:42.956
Are you the guys there you are, girls?

01:04:51.556 --> 01:04:57.206
Until I die, I'm KY, tastier than gingerbread untouched.

01:04:57.296 --> 01:05:00.686
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

01:05:39.957 --> 01:05:45.607
I've been waiting a long time that I would hear what you have to say. Speak!

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:02.378
- Why is he talking about? - He is French.

01:06:02.468 --> 01:06:05.678
Did not you know it?

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:14.328
I knew that I forgot to tell you something Rigosta.

01:06:14.408 --> 01:06:21.838
Rigo was an exchange student from France. He studied here in scholarship.

01:06:21.929 --> 01:06:27.749
Whack, or is this dude the cleanest bastards on earth?

01:06:29.189 --> 01:06:35.009
Rigo turned into a zombie, before he understood English.

01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:41.869
Virus froze his brain, and he never learned English.

01:06:41.909 --> 01:06:48.949
That is, he is not the whole period could not read or understand English?

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:52.469
That is, the whole time everyone gets along -

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:56.549
he has not understood anything, what I have said to him?

01:06:56.639 --> 01:07:00.769
Pull yourself together!

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:06.460
You have an overactive woman, and you will not be able to communicate with men.

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:12.070
We must stop the zombies before they leave campus.

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:16.190
Calm down and do not be so hysterical!

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.020
Äijisty and behave like a woman.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.660
Take a Valium and skarppaa.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.270
I've calmed down.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.530
- Why did you do that? - I do not know.

01:07:34.611 --> 01:07:37.571
I'm high. Oh, hell.

01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:46.651
I made these hyönteismyrkkypulloista zombintorjunta weapons.

01:07:46.731 --> 01:07:53.121
This is almost as much fun as a phone sex.

01:07:54.691 --> 01:07:57.601
Do not waste serum.

01:07:57.681 --> 01:08:01.111
Examination of works that really.

01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:08.981
Hold it!

01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:11.931
Now, I'm ready.

01:08:13.842 --> 01:08:16.282
Behind it all is a woman.

01:08:49.433 --> 01:08:52.082
That was easy.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:56.203
This is why I do not follow the crowd species.

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:59.643
We need to split up.

01:08:59.723 --> 01:09:02.893
I do not know how this could work.

01:09:02.983 --> 01:09:07.723
I can not even look at the "Moulin Rouge" to the end.

01:09:07.803 --> 01:09:12.933
Oh, how sweet. The real-life soap opera.

01:09:13.023 --> 01:09:18.533
We need to leave the Brotherhood of houses.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:23.053
Let's go hoitelemaan guys for free.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.054
Hei, horot!

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:40.044
- This gas panettaa. - Same here.

01:09:48.214 --> 01:09:50.863
You're a sick sexy.

01:09:50.944 --> 01:09:55.944
This is still hot.

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.906
Freedom.

01:10:42.996 --> 01:10:46.996
Brotherhood. Equality.

01:10:50.866 --> 01:10:53.686
Fantastic!

01:11:01.336 --> 01:11:04.846
- Is there more gas? - It is.

01:11:04.936 --> 01:11:10.806
This is hard to say, but without you -

01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:15.587
I think there should have been a woman who I was today.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:18.927
What? What's the matter?

01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:26.357
Oh, my God! I have to take Botox ruiskeeni.

01:11:26.447 --> 01:11:31.827
No, your body is clearly too much BOTOX.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:35.477
The serum is reacting negatively clostridia ...

01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:39.477
Speak English, do not fucking loser language.

01:11:39.567 --> 01:11:43.997
Zombilääke and Botox do not like each other.

01:11:44.087 --> 01:11:48.817
But they made me beautiful. Change me back.

01:11:48.908 --> 01:11:51.508
- Why? - A zombie.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:57.678
Nucleotide sequences and the DNA sequences are combined with correctly.

01:11:57.768 --> 01:12:01.978
I'd rather be dead than ugly. Do you understand?

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.028
Get out of the way!

01:12:06.068 --> 01:12:10.798
Are you hungry? Say something.

01:12:14.018 --> 01:12:17.318
- What lasts? - You are immune.

01:12:17.408 --> 01:12:21.928
- You can not change into a zombie. - Fucking moron!

01:12:22.008 --> 01:12:24.788
You suck.

01:12:24.879 --> 01:12:29.659
- I'm really sorry, Bambi! - You did this on purpose.

01:12:29.749 --> 01:12:32.479
I swear that I did not do.

01:12:32.569 --> 01:12:36.259
- Well maybe a little. - Change me back.

01:12:36.349 --> 01:12:41.429
Onset of immunity may be lifted only by feeding your body the code -

01:12:41.519 --> 01:12:45.599
programmed zombikoneeseen.

01:12:45.689 --> 01:12:47.779
Zombikoneeseen?

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:56.029
- Please. - Lopeta!

01:12:56.119 --> 01:12:59.849
We do not understand each other.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:05.020
We would say no, even if we speak of, we would like to talk about.

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:09.980
Everything has changed. We do not know each other anymore.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.760
So our thing is over.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.190
- Chrissy? - He is not the right man for me.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.350
Do you want a pet or a boyfriend? Think about what you are giving up.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:37.520
- Do you have a bubble gum, Avon? - Of course.

01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:41.431
Do you like this for a moment?

01:13:42.561 --> 01:13:45.121
Wrong pocket.

01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:48.771
Life zombikoneelle minut.

01:13:48.861 --> 01:13:52.341
You heard correctly. And you're in it, the Frenchman!

01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:57.681
I'll blow her brains out and you will be too.

01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:02.591
That is, the movement of the joints. You, too, mulkero.

01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:05.061
Sacre bleu!

01:14:05.151 --> 01:14:08.321
- Do not, Bambi! - Walk.

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:11.451
Right now!

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:17.712
Get in the car. Hi Chrissy? Learn to keep your mouth shut.

01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:20.922
- Rigo! - Do not worry.

01:14:21.012 --> 01:14:26.312
- He will soon be the same. - I do not want that, he is a zombie.

01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:30.052
The machine can kill Rigon.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:34.002
Drive on, old bastard.

01:14:34.092 --> 01:14:37.392
You look like Margaret Truman.

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:40.302
Wait Rigo!

01:14:44.172 --> 01:14:47.902
- Purivatko zombies with you? - Worse.

01:14:47.993 --> 01:14:51.123
Hat them my back.

01:14:51.203 --> 01:14:57.683
- I've done stunts for 9 times. - 10th time lucky says.

01:15:00.283 --> 01:15:02.763
Is this not more?

01:15:02.853 --> 01:15:06.373
Have you used the serum yourself?

01:15:06.453 --> 01:15:10.103
- Why are you talking about hard? - A terrible famine.

01:15:10.193 --> 01:15:13.273
I could eat nachos.

01:15:13.363 --> 01:15:16.313
- And cheese. - What's the matter?

01:15:16.403 --> 01:15:21.663
They could not resist the manly my body.

01:15:21.753 --> 01:15:24.663
I've made a terrible mistake.

01:15:24.744 --> 01:15:27.874
Cheer up. Zombies have almost disappeared.

01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:31.134
- We cleaned the corners. - The problem has been corrected.

01:15:31.224 --> 01:15:35.524
- I need to get labraani. - Let's go to the scooter.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.044
Let's go to your mother's car, Kamikaze.

01:15:38.124 --> 01:15:43.034
I got to borrow it, just because of time until he gets to prison.

01:15:43.084 --> 01:15:47.384
- Give me the keys. - It is the only four-door sedan.

01:15:47.464 --> 01:15:50.984
We have to save Rigo.

01:15:51.074 --> 01:15:55.424
- Mom likes the car more than me. - We do not have to worry.

01:15:55.504 --> 01:16:00.504
His mother's car is invalid. We need some big.

01:16:00.595 --> 01:16:06.105
And the huge and long. The campus is full of zombies.

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:08.845
Exactly.

01:16:11.195 --> 01:16:15.495
We will change this SUV zombintappokoneeksi.

01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:20.445
Please confirm your structures amorphous material.

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:23.745
Lift the car air, -

01:16:23.835 --> 01:16:27.395
so that we can draw guns shafts.

01:16:27.485 --> 01:16:31.305
For ye masturbaatiopäästöjä own ajallanne.

01:16:31.395 --> 01:16:34.305
Let's go hoitelemaan that bitch.

01:16:45.816 --> 01:16:49.116
Out of the car.

01:16:49.206 --> 01:16:54.596
- Just impossible to hustle. - Keep your mouth shut.

01:16:57.286 --> 01:17:00.326
Go to hell for it.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:04.886
- Close your mouth. - Close mouth itsellesi vain.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:22.837
Attack!

01:17:25.787 --> 01:17:28.437
Come on.

01:17:29.657 --> 01:17:33.917
- Step inside. - He does not understand English.

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:36.957
Well, then rotate.

01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:40.037
Enter you.

01:17:40.127 --> 01:17:43.947
I need zombipoikaa restore me into a zombie.

01:17:48.428 --> 01:17:52.638
Die, mulkero! I do not give a shit about you.

01:18:05.408 --> 01:18:08.798
Oh, my God!

01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:12.098
Zombikaasu panettaa.

01:18:12.148 --> 01:18:16.838
- Oh, my God! - These zombies are wild.

01:18:19.448 --> 01:18:23.568
I'll go over here.

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:34.569
- I'm coming. - It comes.

01:18:34.649 --> 01:18:39.869
- I'm coming! - It comes, it comes.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:43.909
- I'm coming! - It comes!

01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:06.499
We need adequate air pressure to produce a torque on the machine.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:10.150
- What are you talking about? - Do not you want to know how it works?

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:14.060
Do I look like that it cares?

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.920
The movement joints!

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:26.870
Menkat would begin.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.480
Are you okay?

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:34.430
We save you, honey.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.520
We will be with you, Chrissy!

01:19:37.601 --> 01:19:40.951
No, this is my battle.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:44.211
Oh, how romantic.

01:19:57.281 --> 01:20:00.501
Do not be sad.

01:20:02.281 --> 01:20:06.931
I soon zombikuningatar and you rotting knights.

01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:14.361
Hei, an hour!

01:20:16.842 --> 01:20:20.352
You need a facelift.

01:20:22.272 --> 01:20:25.182
Yellow teeth!

01:20:26.612 --> 01:20:31.002
- Contact Rigo out of the machine. - I can not do that.

01:20:31.082 --> 01:20:35.522
- You need to open that door. - I can not.

01:20:35.602 --> 01:20:37.782
Fuck you!

01:20:37.862 --> 01:20:41.212
Do not try it.

01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:47.682
- Open the door and get out of the Rigo. - I can not.

01:20:47.772 --> 01:20:53.762
You need to shut your mouth for once and listen.

01:20:53.813 --> 01:20:57.983
Believe me, even Rigo likes this.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:12.663
I do not want this to end.

01:21:15.093 --> 01:21:19.923
You loved me, even if you understood what I said.

01:21:20.003 --> 01:21:22.613
I know that now.

01:21:22.703 --> 01:21:30.173
You tried to talk to me, but I did not listen to this.

01:21:30.264 --> 01:21:32.954
Ultimately -

01:21:33.044 --> 01:21:39.864
our relationship with the zombie was me, not you.

01:21:43.034 --> 01:21:45.644
Rigo?

01:21:45.724 --> 01:21:50.334
I love you.

01:22:02.495 --> 01:22:06.105
- We have to leave. - We can not leave Rigoa.

01:22:06.195 --> 01:22:14.015
Rigon has to be within the machine so that he can use it.

01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:18.395
- I use it. - No way.

01:22:18.485 --> 01:22:22.915
He's trying to save the world because of you.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:27.995
Hold it! I want to be a zombie.

01:22:28.085 --> 01:22:31.175
You're a dead bitch, if you stay here.

01:22:31.255 --> 01:22:33.955
I can not live with this the sidelines.

01:22:34.035 --> 01:22:40.515
- Go to hell. - Wait!

01:22:40.596 --> 01:22:42.856
It for you!

01:22:47.246 --> 01:22:49.986
Spike!

01:23:14.397 --> 01:23:16.617
Rigo?

01:23:19.487 --> 01:23:21.917
Oh, my God! Did you see?

01:23:40.377 --> 01:23:43.247
Rigo, and ...

01:23:45.157 --> 01:23:47.547
Awesome.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.808
PJ?

01:23:58.888 --> 01:24:02.408
- PJ-gold? - Grandma?

01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:07.278
I here, Bambi.

01:24:08.358 --> 01:24:14.838
That is not worthy of me, that is, bye.

01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:21.868
I'm alive.

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:25.218
Where is Rigo?

01:24:51.939 --> 01:24:54.499
You are not dead.

01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:10.060
You are not dead.

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.310
And you're not a zombie. You are you.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.350
How can I talk to him when he does not understand?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.830
Use this translation application.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:27.170
Great! I have so much to say.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.170
And I want you to tell me things.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:40.210
How do you say "I love you"?

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:45.201
Fuck me with a French sausage.

01:25:45.291 --> 01:25:50.811
Porn setting was on. Please try again.

01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:54.331
How do you say "I love you"?

01:25:54.411 --> 01:25:56.241
I love you.

01:25:56.321 --> 01:25:59.411
All right.

01:25:59.501 --> 01:26:03.581
Rigo, I love you.

01:26:04.801 --> 01:26:07.531
I love you, Chrissy.

01:26:17.962 --> 01:26:19.782
Oh, how cute.

01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:35.732
- I'm only 20 years old! - There's a lecherous old men.

01:26:35.772 --> 01:26:40.292
- They are really nice. - I'll eat your baby, bitch!

01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:43.942
He must take it easy.

01:26:45.162 --> 01:26:48.462
Someone has to feed her cat.

01:26:50.593 --> 01:26:52.593
- Me. - Me.

01:26:56.973 --> 01:27:00.933
- Do you like orgies? - Share tykkäänkö?

01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:05.883
Did I teach you biology last semester?

01:27:05.973 --> 01:27:09.963
- So you are no longer my student. - I do not like that.

01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:37.294
Come on out of there!

01:27:42.464 --> 01:27:45.374
Who's there?

01:27:48.634 --> 01:27:49.315
Is someone there?

01:28:12.835 --> 01:28:20.265
Translated by: www.ordiovision.com

01:28:25.475 --> 01:28:29.435
- What kind of movies you like? - Oh, shit!

01:28:33.735 --> 01:28:36.035
Come on, I want to undress!

01:28:36.125 --> 01:28:39.075
I want to go vilauttelemaan tits.

01:28:42.896 --> 01:28:47.026
- Is that a zombie? - It seems to be in need of sleep.

01:28:47.116 --> 01:28:50.506
It is the dick veins.

01:28:50.586 --> 01:28:55.456
- Do you like to fuck the dead? - He looks like a alaperseeltäni.

01:29:02.496 --> 01:29:03.836
YÖK!

01:29:03.926 --> 01:29:07.486
I want to do this for a living.

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:12.056
This is the best day ever.

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:26.257
Oh, my God!
