WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.907
Did you remember to ask
for left-handed chopsticks?

00:10.778 --> 00:12.446
Oh, yeah.
Here they are.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.084
Thanks.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.951
Oh, and where are we
on the left-handed
toilet paper?

00:19.320 --> 00:22.323
Oh, I bought it.
It's in all
the bathrooms now.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.791
Finally.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.263
Beloved family.
Dave.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.567
Okay, don't freak out,

00:33.634 --> 00:35.136
but I have something
to tell you.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.171
Is it the car?
Is it grades?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.507
Did Tammy dye her hair?
I told her she shouldn't.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.941
It's nothing bad.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.511
Although Tammy did go blond,
and it is no bueno.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.645
(LAUGHING)

00:44.712 --> 00:46.880
See? I knew
it'd wash her out.

00:46.947 --> 00:50.017
I told her to go chestnut,
maybe auburn. You know what?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.186
I'll go Snapchat her
some color samples.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.854
No, you won't.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.856
What's going on, honey?

00:55.923 --> 00:59.026
Well, there's this guy,
Sean, in my class.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.061
He's sweet,
he's on the wrestling team,

01:01.129 --> 01:03.264
we really like each other...

01:03.331 --> 01:07.468
And last Friday,
we took it to the next level.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.970
Ew, gross!
I don't want
to hear about that.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.441
No, he asked me
to be his girlfriend.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.244
(GROANS) Next time,
lead with that,
all right, sweetie?

01:16.310 --> 01:17.878
Gross.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.414
Anyway,
it's really important to me
that you guys to meet him.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.317
Seriously?
You're usually so private
about that stuff.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.986
Well, you're the people
that matter most to me,

01:26.053 --> 01:28.122
and I wanted to make sure
you approved of him.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.190
Or...

01:32.460 --> 01:34.328
(SIGHS) There's a bonfire
at surfside next weekend,

01:34.395 --> 01:36.930
and I knew you wouldn't
let me go if you
didn't meet him first.

01:36.997 --> 01:40.067
Molly, predictable
as the sunrise.

01:43.003 --> 01:46.073
Okay, he'll be here soon.
Just please don't
embarrass me.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.243
Don't worry, Mol.
I know your mom's
a bit of a social sandbag,

01:49.310 --> 01:52.045
but I'll be
the conversational
rising tide

01:52.112 --> 01:53.881
that lifts all boats.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.185
Seriously, Mom.
Handle your man.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.288
(DOORBELL RINGS)

02:00.354 --> 02:02.055
Okay, that's him.
Mom, you look great.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.158
Dave, stop chewing.
Dad, your fly.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.327
Hells yeah, I'm fly.
I'm supah fly!

02:06.394 --> 02:08.529
(SIGHS) No, your fly
is "supah" open!

02:10.798 --> 02:11.999
Hey.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.334
Hey.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.069
Guys, this is Sean.
Hi, everyone.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.272
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

02:18.339 --> 02:22.276
A pleasure to meet you?
Where are we,
Buckingham Palace?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.412
Get inside these
love sticks, Sean.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.579
We hug in this house!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.282
Can you just...
Oh, okay.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.483
(DR. KEN GROANING)

02:35.756 --> 02:37.558
So, you're a wrestler, huh?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.092
If I had to pick my faves,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.230
I'd go with the undertaker
or junkyard dog.
How about you?

02:44.031 --> 02:46.066
Well, actually,
I'm on the high school
wrestling team, sir.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.035
I think those guys
are more like entertainers.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.503
Oh, really?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.439
Mmm.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.374
Hmm. Entertainment, huh?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.544
Well, let's see
if you can handle the

02:56.610 --> 02:58.078
Iron claw! Ah!

02:58.145 --> 02:59.380
(GROANING)

03:00.648 --> 03:02.616
Ah. Impressive.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.918
(GRUNTS)

03:04.985 --> 03:06.987
You can let go
of my hand now.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.656
(CHUCKLES)

03:08.722 --> 03:10.157
And the claw!
(GRUNTS)

03:11.725 --> 03:14.328
(CHUCKLES) Okay. Well,
this kid's ring-ready.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.629
Oh, you're gonna love this.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.631
Molly, go get my
Mexican wrestling mask.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.099
I will not.

03:20.468 --> 03:23.170
So, your family just
moved down from Seattle?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.705
How's the adjustment been?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.274
It's been pretty good,
thanks.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.208
Question,
in high school wrestling,

03:28.276 --> 03:31.845
what are the rules
about hitting each other
with folding chairs?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.514
Again, that's
a whole different thing.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.616
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, it's awesome.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.118
Sean, I noticed
that your watch is

03:38.185 --> 03:40.187
on your right hand.
Are you a lefty?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.822
I am.
So am I!

03:41.889 --> 03:43.156
Cool. Did you know
that four

03:43.223 --> 03:44.958
out of the last seven
presidents were lefties?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.895
Of course I knew.
I just didn't think
anyone else did.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.463
You're gonna love
our toilet paper.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.333
(MOUTHING)

03:55.469 --> 03:56.904
And that's our cue.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.906
We should probably
get going.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.274
It was really nice
to meet you guys.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.875
Sean, wait.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.011
I just want to say
you seem like
a really nice kid,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.446
and so I'm glad
Molly found...

04:05.513 --> 04:07.114
Ha! Ahhh! (EXCLAIMS)

04:07.180 --> 04:09.016
Apricot! Apricot!

04:09.082 --> 04:10.250
That means let him go.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.820
(CHUCKLES) Well done, Sean.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.725
You guys have a safe word?
Gross.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.061
Wow.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.996
Sweet kid, huh?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.265
We may have
a bit of a problem.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.601
I think his mother
is a patient of mine.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.869
Wait. Really?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.839
Yep. The last name,
the recent move,
it all adds up.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.441
So his mom's
in therapy with you?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.509
Yeah.
This could be an issue.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.678
An issue-tunity.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.681
If we can get
in the mom's head,

04:40.748 --> 04:41.982
we can get in his head.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.684
We can own that kid.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.885
I thought you liked him.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.821
I can like and own
at the same time, Allison.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.324
I can do a lot of things
at the same time.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.725
You've seen me
dance-reading.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.797
Look, it's not
the end of the world.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.098
I'll just tell Sean's mom

04:58.165 --> 05:01.034
and maybe refer her
to another therapist.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.404
Yeah, makes sense.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.473
So, does she talk about him?
Something wrong with him?

05:05.539 --> 05:08.008
Compulsive? Narcissistic?
Asian fetish?

05:08.075 --> 05:10.210
No, that's you.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.280
What can I say?
I likes what I likes.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.816
(CHUCKLES)

05:16.484 --> 05:17.718
Damn!

05:18.952 --> 05:20.153
Mmm!

05:23.757 --> 05:25.659
Ken.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.128
I feel that
you and I are friends.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.498
Really? We're gonna have
that argument again?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.667
I just found out
that once a year,

05:33.734 --> 05:35.869
all managers at Welltopia
get an evaluation

05:35.936 --> 05:39.106
based on the collective
feedback of their
subordinates.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.410
(LAUGHING) Oh, man,
they're gonna crush you.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.278
They do not like you
at all.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.248
I know,
and this evaluation

05:48.315 --> 05:51.184
could determine my bonus
or whether I get a promotion.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.754
(CHUCKLES) Spoiler alert!
You're not getting those.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.656
All right.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.691
I know I may have been
a little hard on some people

05:57.758 --> 05:58.926
since I got here,

05:58.992 --> 06:00.694
but in my defense,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
I did not know
I'd be held accountable.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.668
Now, these evaluations
are due in two days.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.202
Well, I think you know
what you have to do.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.271
Yeah.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.373
I know exactly
what I have to do.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.809
I know where you live,
and I have all your
social security numbers.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.144
I can hurt you.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.849
Solid threats, but I meant
you have to be nice to them.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.651
All right, fine.
I'll try it.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.553
Hey, everyone.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.521
You look like
you've lost some weight.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.857
I don't know,
about two pounds...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.024
Each.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.394
And have you done something
with your hair?

06:37.097 --> 06:40.233
Okay, they don't all
have to be group
compliments, Pat.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.335
Well, this is
gonna take forever.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.377
So, listen, before we start
today's session,

06:50.444 --> 06:52.245
there's something
I need to tell you.

06:52.312 --> 06:55.783
It seems that your son, Sean,
is dating my daughter.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.385
Oh, my God, small world.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.588
I had no idea
you were Chloe's mom.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.059
Sean's cheating on Molly?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.896
Apparently, he's dating
some girl named Chloe.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.464
That bastard.
I trusted him.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.365
I even ordered these!

07:20.307 --> 07:21.875
I can't believe it.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.211
Molly's so into that kid,
and he's cheating on her.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.280
I swear to God, I'd like to
get him in a wrestling ring
and just crush him!

07:27.347 --> 07:29.416
Please.
Oh, you don't think
I could?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.552
You give me his address
and a folding chair.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.353
I'll go over there
right now.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.589
No DQ! In a cage!

07:37.190 --> 07:40.360
God, poor Molly.
I wish we could tell her.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.962
Wait. What?
Why can't we?

07:42.029 --> 07:43.897
Ken, the mom told me
during therapy.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.000
It's a confidentiality issue.
You know I can't violate that.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.403
Why? Everybody violates that.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.940
My patient Raymond Boyd
has gout.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.708
Ooh! There, I said it.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.244
Well, actually,
that's a bad example.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.046
He wrote that memoir,
"Boyd meets gout,"

07:59.112 --> 08:00.914
But the point is,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.950
this is our daughter
we're talking about.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.351
I know!

08:04.417 --> 08:06.253
And believe me,
I'd also like
to get into a ring

08:06.319 --> 08:07.988
and smash him
with a frying pan.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.792
A frying pan?
Allison, it's a sport,
not a cartoon.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.628
Bottom line,

08:14.695 --> 08:16.630
if we tell Molly about this,
I could lose my job.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.666
(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.067
Besides, they're 16.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.069
This thing
could be over tomorrow.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.537
And if we told her,

08:23.604 --> 08:25.172
we could be breaking
her heart for no reason.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.940
You're right.
Molly does go through boys

08:27.007 --> 08:29.009
like she goes through
spring rompers.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.979
You need more male friends.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.954
I mean, because of Allison's
stupid "professional ethics,"

08:41.021 --> 08:42.623
We can't even tell
our own daughter

08:42.690 --> 08:44.391
she's dating Cheater Pan.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.095
(IMITATES PETER PAN)
Look! I can lie!

08:51.098 --> 08:53.100
Okay, you can't say
"Cheater Pan"

08:53.166 --> 08:54.534
and expect me
not to do that.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.907
So... Julie, is it?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.410
I see you enjoy
putting miniature succulents

09:03.476 --> 09:05.078
into old cans.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.814
I do!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.683
I like how each of them
has a story.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.984
This one, for instance..
Great story!

09:11.051 --> 09:12.285
Left me wanting more.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.154
There is more.
Good-bye.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.892
So, Clark...

09:18.959 --> 09:22.095
That whole gay marriage thing
seems to be taking off.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.832
That must be good news
for a fella like you who...

09:24.898 --> 09:27.801
Enjoys the... comforts
of other fellas.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.806
Okay, somehow you have just
ruined being gay for me.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.444
You're a delight!
Good-bye.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.914
Damona, let me take those.
You do enough around here.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.884
Get the hell off of me,
grandpa.

09:43.951 --> 09:47.387
I love our rapport.
Good-bye.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.624
This is easier
than I thought.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.725
Good-bye.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.735
'Sup, bae?
How's it hangin'?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.270
Molly and Dave
are in the living room

10:03.336 --> 10:05.773
with Cheatwood Mac.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.008
Hey, Al, you know
how you said this
might end tomorrow?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.210
Well, it's tomorrow,
and it didn't.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.411
I'm going proactive.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.313
Ken, we can't say anything.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.849
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll just hint at it
until he folds.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.285
Like the chair I'll hit him
with if he doesn't.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.087
No, no, no.
We can't. Mmm!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.355
Hey, guys,
what's the haps?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.557
Oh, hello, Sean.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
Hi, Dr. Park.
We're playing Risk.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.229
Indeed you are, Sean.
Indeed you are.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.566
Dave, you just rolled
with your right hand.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.669
Yeah, I'm a righty
in athletics.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.041
Ooh, Sean,
did you really
roll a six?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.311
Because if you didn't,
that would be dishonest.
Ken.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.646
Dad, what are you doing?
Oh, don't listen to him.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.081
Why don't you go
into the kitchen

10:48.148 --> 10:49.316
and get more lemon cookies?

10:49.382 --> 10:51.518
Oh, I would,
but if anyone is dieting,

10:51.584 --> 10:55.756
then eating those would be
unfaithful to their diet.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.058
Eh, they're only
40 calories each.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.761
I know. It seems
too good to be true.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.368
Because if someone
was being unfaithful,

11:08.435 --> 11:11.238
I would hope they would have
the decency to come clean.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.505
What are you doing?

11:12.572 --> 11:16.076
Because guilt is
a very powerful thing.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.445
And if you hold onto it
for too long,

11:18.511 --> 11:20.814
it'll burn and burn,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.817
hotter and hotter
and hotter...

11:23.884 --> 11:25.418
Dad!
I'm building
to something.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.787
And hotter.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.458
I'm done.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.061
Is there something
wrong here?
Sean, let's get out of here.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.628
Cheater!
You're a cheater! (GASPS)

11:38.465 --> 11:40.133
Wow, went right at it.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.269
I didn't mean to...

11:42.335 --> 11:44.071
Okay, fine. I admit it!

11:44.137 --> 11:46.139
I cheated on you.
What?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.808
What?
What?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.344
I don't know
how my parents knew,

11:51.411 --> 11:52.712
but I cheated on you
with Brayden

11:52.780 --> 11:55.548
because I thought you were
still going out with Chloe.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.518
I'm so sorry, Sean.
No, I can't believe
you would do that!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.322
Sean, wait!

12:02.389 --> 12:04.357
DAVE: Wait, Sean!
We can talk about this!

12:06.693 --> 12:07.995
We're in a fight.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.065
Honey, I'm sorry.
We thought that...

12:12.132 --> 12:13.767
No, I don't care
what you thought!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.535
I don't know how
I'm gonna retaliate for this,

12:15.602 --> 12:17.237
but it's probably
gonna be older,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.639
and it's probably
gonna drive a motorcycle.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.980
Well, that took a turn.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.890
Okay, it's actually
not as bad as we thought.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.493
I talked to Molly.
It turns out
she didn't cheat.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.030
It was just
a slight overlap.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.264
Overlap?

12:44.331 --> 12:45.632
She was dating Brayden,

12:45.698 --> 12:47.134
then she met Sean.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.502
There was a little overlap
while she made up her mind.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.971
Okay, that's still cheating.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.639
I mean, how does this
not bother you?

12:52.705 --> 12:54.374
It's wrong.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.210
I mean, we never would've
done that to each other.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.146
Right.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.255
Allison,
did you overlap me?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.223
What? That's crazy.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.395
I mean, when I met you,
I was dating Billy Tanaka,

13:15.462 --> 13:17.898
but I dumped him
because you were so great.

13:21.268 --> 13:25.906
Was... there...
over... lap?

13:28.375 --> 13:29.843
I don't know.
Maybe a week.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.912
It was so long ago.
Who remembers?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.584
Thank you
for finally admitting that.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.887
Oh, come on.
You're not really...

13:39.953 --> 13:41.521
Don't touch me.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.926
Apricot.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.771
Remember this?
What?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.741
Our third date
at the Santa Monica pier.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.577
I won you a framed poster
of Penny Hardaway

14:04.644 --> 14:05.745
at the pop-a-shot.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.815
I kissed you
on the Ferris wheel,

14:08.882 --> 14:11.351
and we heard fireworks.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.620
Well, it turned out
to be gang violence
in the parking lot,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.089
but still, what a night.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.492
Yes, Ken.
It was a great night.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.230
But little did I know,
I was your side piece,
Allison.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.767
I can't believe
you're this upset

14:27.834 --> 14:31.704
about something so small
that happened so long ago.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.673
All right,
I have to go to work now.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.308
And when I get home,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.245
it'd be really convenient
if you were no longer seven.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.348
Oh, I'm being immature?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.183
You tarnished
our origin story.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.619
Look, when I first met you,
it was magical.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.056
And I always thought
you felt the same way.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.258
But now I know...
You didn't.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.128
Did Sean call?
Did he text?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.130
No, honey.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.132
Everyone says
breakups are hard,

14:59.199 --> 15:01.501
but I had no idea.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.975
I'll be in bed.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.742
Need a spoon, buddy?
Nope.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.952
Why is there a little man
making eggs up in here?

15:19.786 --> 15:20.954
They're omelets,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.923
as in "om-letting you know
how much I appreciate you."

15:25.458 --> 15:29.596
Enjoy, because my gratitude
is without limits.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.999
Mr. Pat says only
two ingredients per omelet.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.566
And go light
on the cheese.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.901
Juan-Julio,

15:34.968 --> 15:37.470
the cheese thing
that was between us.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.806
My mistake.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.474
Guys, the cheese thing
was between us.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.912
It's weird you're
being so generous.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.848
Last week, you stuck a box
of floss in the break room

15:48.915 --> 15:51.551
and said, "Here's your
new dental plan."

15:53.453 --> 15:55.588
And when I asked
for toilet-seat covers,

15:55.655 --> 15:59.292
you said,
"No! Live on the edge."

15:59.359 --> 16:01.261
Yes, well,
that was the past.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.662
Oh, but this morning,

16:02.729 --> 16:04.297
when I asked
if you would pay me
to make omelets,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.499
you said, "You're a valet.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.137
"Why would I pay you
to make omelets,
Juan-Julio?"

16:13.306 --> 16:16.209
I think what we're
missing here

16:16.276 --> 16:18.845
is that I have
become a thoughtful
and generous boss

16:18.911 --> 16:21.114
who cares deeply about
the welfare of his employees.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.749
I see what's going on here.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.552
You're trying to bribe us
to get better evaluations.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.387
Oh, thank God. Now that
it's all out in the open,

16:27.454 --> 16:29.956
it should go
a lot more smoothly.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.026
So what's it gonna take,
people? Money?
Time off? Pudding?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.794
But wait.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.164
We all handed those forms
in two weeks ago.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.032
Everyone at Welltopia...

16:39.099 --> 16:40.933
Is time off
still on the table?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.437
Because I would like
to get out of here.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.240
So, you mean to say
I've been treating you
all kindly

16:47.307 --> 16:48.675
for no good reason?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.843
Oh, no, Pat.
Kindness has its own...

16:50.910 --> 16:52.079
Cram it, gorgeous.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.282
Pack it up,
Juan-Julio.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.453
(DOORBELL RINGING)

17:05.558 --> 17:06.826
Hi, Dr. Park.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.529
Sean, my overlap brother.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.398
Get inside
these comfort sticks.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.103
I feel your pain.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.771
Look, I know you're here
to tell Molly off
and that's fair,

17:18.838 --> 17:21.174
but just remember,
she can't help it.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.377
Turns out
cheating is genetic.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.614
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm here to pick her up.
We got back together.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.917
Even though she tarnished
your origin story?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.885
I mean, maybe a few years ago,
I would have felt like that,

17:32.952 --> 17:34.721
but I'm 17 now.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.089
I'm not a child.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.393
Yeah, totally.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.562
Anyways, I had, like,
this "a-ha" moment.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.897
I mean, was it a bummer
that she was with
someone else when we met?

17:44.964 --> 17:46.133
Absolutely.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.434
But she gave him up,

17:47.500 --> 17:48.768
which proves
how much she likes me.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.305
Huh.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.640
Can you, you know?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.811
So anyway, I had,
like, this "a-ha" moment.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.247
I mean,
was it a bummer

18:00.313 --> 18:01.781
that you were with
someone else when we met?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.183
Absolutely.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.584
But you gave him up,

18:04.651 --> 18:06.186
which proves
how much she likes me.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.587
Who's she?
You!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.957
Wow. You know what?

18:11.023 --> 18:13.126
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.695
Hey, when it's from
the heart, it's easy.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.996
I wonder if it was easy

18:17.063 --> 18:18.798
when Sean said those
exact words to Molly.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.101
(SIGHS)

18:22.169 --> 18:23.336

in a wrestler's body.

Greg "The Hammer" Valentine.

something.

Oh, my God!

You still have this.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.655
Yeah, I saved everything
from that night.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.257
The wristband
to go on the rides,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.193
the rose you bought me,

18:46.259 --> 18:48.528
the statement
we gave to police
about the gang shooting.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.531
Aw. Double homicide.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.603
We have the same
origin story, Ken,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.137
and it's a great story.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.807
Yeah.

live happily ever after?

Billy Tanaka.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.045

sold his company

19:06.112 --> 19:07.247
for $100 million.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.481
And he's still single,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.016
and he's, like,

I don't know if you heard,
but we're back together.

Yes, I did,
and I'm really happy for you.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.464
Thanks, Dad.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.534
I'm happy, too,
but I've got to be honest.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.602
I think I'm gonna focus
on me for a while.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.283
Ken, I got my evaluation,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.885
and I'm a little too
nervous to read it alone.
Do you mind?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.787
Nervous?
You should be terrified.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.556
(LAUGHS)

19:49.622 --> 19:51.458
This is gonna be
a bloodbath.
