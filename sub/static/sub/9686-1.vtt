02:22.851 --> 02:25.102
Let me get you another drink.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.523
Mark, before Tony comes...

02:28.690 --> 02:31.025
I ought to explain something.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.361
Yes, I've been waiting for that.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.780
I haven't told him anything about us.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.241
That's not surprising.
It's a tough thing to do.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.076
When you telephoned this morning...

02:40.244 --> 02:42.286
I simply said you wrote crime stories...

02:42.454 --> 02:44.413
and I'd met you once
when you were here before.

02:45.581 --> 02:47.959
That has a pretty guilty ring to it.
I'd never use it in one of my stories.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.046
Mark, I know you think it's silly,
but when you get to know Tony...

02:52.214 --> 02:54.006
you'll understand why I said that.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.093
Darling, I understand now
but that doesn't stop me from loving you.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.638
It's not as simple as that.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
Tony's changed.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.771
Thanks.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.108
He's a completely different person
to the one I used to tell you about.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.110
Really? When did all this happen?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.445
That night I came to say goodbye.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.574
When I left your apartment,
I came back here.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.995
I sat down on the sofa and had a good cry.
And then I fell asleep.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.622
And when I woke up,
there was Tony standing in the hall...

03:26.790 --> 03:28.708
with all his bags and tennis rackets.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.420
He just said he decided to give up tennis
and settle down to a job.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.380
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.718
Of course I didn't believe him at first,
but he meant it all right.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.887
But he's been wonderful ever since.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.847
I suppose that's when you stopped writing me?

03:43.807 --> 03:45.808
Margot, is it?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.853
Do you remember the letters
you wrote to me?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.563
Yes, I remember.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.358
After I read them, I burned them.
I thought it best.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.652
All except one.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.738
You probably know the one I mean.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.491
Yes, I think I do. What about it?

04:03.368 --> 04:04.535
It was stolen.

04:08.290 --> 04:12.043
One day Tony and I were going to spend
the weekend in the country with friends.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.129
While we were waiting on the platform,
I noticed my handbag was missing...

04:15.297 --> 04:16.714
and the letter was inside.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.548
Where was this?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.257
Victoria Station.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.010
I thought I left it in the restaurant...

04:21.178 --> 04:22.929
but when I went back to look,
it had gone.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.639
You mean you never found it?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.016
I recovered the handbag
about two weeks later...

04:27.184 --> 04:30.937
from the lost and found,
but the letter wasn't there.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.732
And then about a week afterwards,
I received a note.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.943
It told me what I had to do
to get the letter back.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.320
Yes. Go ahead. Go on.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.158
I was to draw £50 from my bank in £5 notes...

04:44.326 --> 04:47.286
and then change them for used £1 notes.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.123
It said that if I went to the police
or told anyone else...

04:51.291 --> 04:52.917
he would show the letter to my husband.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.293
You still have the note?

05:22.948 --> 05:25.908
Printed, all capitals.
Anyone could have done this.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.369
And two days later, I got this one.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.830
Both mailed in Brixton.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.627
"Tie up the money in a package...

05:36.795 --> 05:39.672
and mail to John S. King,
23 Newport Street, Brixton SW 9.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.257
You'll get your letter by return."

05:41.425 --> 05:44.176
It's a little shop.
People use it as a forwarding address.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.053
You didn't mail the money?

05:46.221 --> 05:48.681
- Yes, but the letter was never returned.
- Margot.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.017
So after waiting about two weeks,
I went there.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.310
Said they'd never heard of a man
by that name.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.855
And the parcel was still there,
it had never been opened.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.441
Well, that's something, I suppose.
May I keep these?

05:58.608 --> 05:59.650
Yes, if you like.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.444
I can't understand why you didn't tell me.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.988
There wasn't anything you could do.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.657
You probably would've made me
tell Tony and the police.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.827
As it was only £50,
I thought I'd pay up and have done with it.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.746
Margot, I better tell Tony about us tonight.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.789
No, Mark, please, you mustn't.

06:13.957 --> 06:18.002
You don't understand.
Tony's changed. Please.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.215
I wish it was a year ago
when you came to say goodbye.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.343
We were in the kitchen. I nearly said,
"I can't go through with this.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.846
Let's find Tony and tell him all about it."

06:29.014 --> 06:31.515
I believe you'd have done it then.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.686
Well, I can see this is gonna be
a rough evening.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.522
All of us saying nice things to each other.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.194
Look, there's only one thing
you haven't explained.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.155
Why didn't you burn that letter too?

07:01.797 --> 07:04.131
There you are.
We thought you were never coming.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.382
What have you been up to?

07:05.550 --> 07:08.302
Oh, I'm sorry, but the boss blew in
just as I was leaving.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.887
Tony, this is Mark Halliday.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.263
- Hello, Mark.
- Tony, hello.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.016
I'm terribly sorry to be so late.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.685
How do you like it over here?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.312
Oh, fine. Just fine, Tony.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.523
Is this your first visit to London?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.734
No, no. I was here a year ago for a vacation.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.486
Oh, yes, that's right.
Margot told me.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.613
You, uh....
You write for the radio, don't you?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.200
- No, television, for my sins.
- Darling, did you reserve a table?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.035
- Yes, 7:00.
- Well, come on then--

07:33.203 --> 07:35.246
Oh, darling, a slight alteration in plans.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.581
- Oh, now don't say you can't go.
- I'm afraid so.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.834
Old man Burgess is flying to Brussels on Sunday...

07:40.001 --> 07:42.128
and I have to get my monthly report in
by tomorrow.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.963
Well, can't you do it when we get back?

07:44.131 --> 07:47.716
I'm afraid not. It'll take hours.
I shall have to fake half of it as it is.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.093
But....

07:49.261 --> 07:51.846
Could you join us after the theater?
We might go somewhere.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.889
Why don't you give me a ring at intermission?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.391
If I'm inspired, I might make it.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.767
- Well, do try.
- All right.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.811
I'll just get my things, Mark.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.814
- Oh, here are the tickets.
- Oh, thanks, Tony.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.649
I'm afraid this is terribly rude of me.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.784
Not at all.
I'm just sorry you can't come.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.111
You must come to dinner.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.821
- Thanks, I'd like that.
- By the way...

08:08.989 --> 08:11.824
- what are you doing tomorrow night?
- Saturday? Nothing I know of.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.451
- How'd you like to come to a stag party?
- A stag party?

08:14.619 --> 08:17.204
Yes. Some American boys
have been playing tennis all over.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.331
We're giving them a sort of farewell dinner.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.000
Well, I'm not much of a tennis player.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.210
That doesn't matter.
You know New York and all that.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.838
- Mark's coming to the party tomorrow.
- Oh, good.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.048
Well, you better drop in here first
and have a drink.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.093
- That's the idea.
- Yes. All right. I'll try and get a taxi.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.636
Oh, no. We can usually pick one up.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.681
So long, darling.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.057
Enjoy yourself.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.434
- So long, Tony.
- Good night.

08:41.270 --> 08:41.937
Oh, Mark?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.230
Yes?

08:43.398 --> 08:45.649
Sell the extra ticket.
Have a drink on the proceeds.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.902
- All right, Tony, we'll try.
- Have a good time.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.361
Thanks. Night.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.189
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. Hampstead 7899?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.107
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Could I speak to Captain Lesgate?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.067
<i>Speaking.</i>

09:28.235 --> 09:30.778
Oh, good evening. You don't know me.
My name is Fisher.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.529
I understand you have a car for sale.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.031
<i>Oh, yes, an American car.</i>

09:34.199 --> 09:36.533
Yes, I saw it at your garage.
How much are you asking?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.827
- <i>Eleven hundred.</i>
- Eleven hundred, I see.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.997
Well, it certainly looks just the job for me.
But I don't like that price.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.916
<i>Well, I didn't like it when I bought it.</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:45.834
Now, when can we meet? 

09:46.002 --> 09:47.962
<i>Well, now, how about tomorrow afternoon?</i>

09:48.129 --> 09:49.755
I'm afraid I can't manage that.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.217
Uh, no, I can't,
and I'm going to Liverpool on Sunday.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.677
I was rather hoping....

09:54.844 --> 09:56.845
I say, you couldn't come around
to my flat tonight?

09:57.013 --> 09:58.597
- <i>Where is it?</i>
- Maida Vale.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.308
I'd call on you,
only I've twisted my knee rather badly.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.519
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what's your address?</i>

10:03.687 --> 10:04.895
61-A Charrington Gardens.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.981
- <i>Harrington? Oh.</i>
- Oh, no, no. Charrington.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.650
Turn left at the underground.
It's about a two minutes' walk.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.193
<i>I'll be there in about an hour.</i>

10:11.361 --> 10:14.571
That's extremely good of you.
Oh, by the way, will you be bringing the car?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.198
<i>Oh, I'm afraid I can't--</i>

10:16.366 --> 10:18.409
Well, that doesn't matter.
I had a good look at it.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.203
As you might bring the registration book
and any necessary papers.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.037
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

10:22.205 --> 10:24.331
I don't see why we couldn't
settle this thing here...

10:24.499 --> 10:26.250
provided you drop the price sufficiently.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.377
<i>Oh, I'm afraid that's out of the question.</i>

10:28.545 --> 10:30.546
Well, we'll see what a couple of drinks can do.

10:31.923 --> 10:32.881
Uh, goodbye.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.258
<i>Goodbye.</i>

11:15.342 --> 11:17.009
- Mr. Fisher?
- Yes. Captain Lesgate?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.135
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?

11:18.303 --> 11:19.762
Thank you.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.014
It's very good of you.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.433
Let me have your coat.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.312
- Have any difficulty finding your way?
- No. None at all.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.190
Do sit down. How about a drink?

11:31.816 --> 11:34.276
You know, I can't help thinking
I've seen you before somewhere.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.320
You know, it's funny
you should mention that.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.572
The moment I opened the door, I....

11:38.865 --> 11:41.742
Wait a minute. Lesgate?

11:41.993 --> 11:46.121
You're not Lesgate. Swann.
C.J. Swann. Or was it C.A?

11:46.289 --> 11:50.667
C.A. Well, you've got a better memory
than I have.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.795
Fisher. When did we meet?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.421
- Weren't you at Cambridge?
- Yes.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.174
Must be 20 years ago.
You wouldn't remember me.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.051
I only came your last year.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.344
Well, what a coincidence.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.888
Yes, this calls for a special drink.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.391
I was planning to palm you off
with an indifferent port...

12:05.558 --> 12:08.519
but let's see what we have here.
How about this?

12:08.686 --> 12:09.978
Perfect.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.982
By the way,
how do you know my car's for sale?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.818
Your garage told me.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.694
That's odd. I didn't mention it to anyone.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.614
I was stopping for a fill-up
and I told them I was looking for a car.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.784
They gave me your phone number.
I say, it is for sale, isn't it?

12:23.952 --> 12:26.328
- Well, of course.
- Good. I refuse to discuss the price...

12:26.496 --> 12:27.955
until you've had three brandies.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.707
Well, I warn you, I drive a hard bargain,
drunk or sober.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.126
So do I.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.006
You know, I think I must have seen you somewhere
since we left Cambridge.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.758
Ever been to Wimbledon?

12:40.969 --> 12:45.097
That's it. Wendice. Tony Wendice.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.807
What's all this about Fisher?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.434
What's all this about Lesgate?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.312
Would you like a cigar?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.315
No, thanks. I'll just stick to my pipe.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.192
That's one habit you've changed.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.527
- Oh?
- I remember, at college...

12:58.695 --> 13:01.363
you always used to smoke
rather expensive cigars.

13:01.531 --> 13:05.033
Wait a minute, I think
I have a picture of you here somewhere.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
Yes.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.621
Yes. Here's one...

13:10.039 --> 13:12.166
taken at a reunion dinner.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.500
There you are.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.377
With the biggest cigar in the business.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.755
Well, that's the first and last reunion
I ever went to.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.799
What a murderous thug I look.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.718
Yes, you do, rather.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.014
Of course I always remember you
because of the college ball.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.640
You were the treasurer, weren't you?

13:28.808 --> 13:29.850
Honorary treasurer.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.935
I used to organize the beastly things.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.896
Yes. Some of the ticket money was stolen...

13:34.063 --> 13:36.732
- wasn't it?
- That's right. Almost £100.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.569
I'd left it in a cashbox in my study
and in the morning it had gone.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.196
It was the college porter, of course.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.114
Yes, of course. Poor old Alfred.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.532
He never could back a winner.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.368
They found the cashbox in his back garden.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.578
But not the money.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.540
Twenty years ago.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.167
What are you doing nowadays?

13:55.668 --> 13:56.752
I deal in property.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.254
I say, I don't follow tennis closely.
Do you still play?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.673
No, I've given up tennis,
or rather, tennis gave me up.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.927
One has to earn a living sometime,
and I had a good run for my money.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.595
Went round the world three times.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.515
- What are you doing now?
- I sell sports equipment.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.392
It's not very lucrative,
but it gives me plenty of spare time.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.521
Well, I see you manage to run
a very comfortable place.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.523
My wife has some money of her own.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.360
Otherwise, I should hardly feel
like blowing £1000 on your car.

14:21.928 --> 14:22.986
1100. 

14:23.780 --> 14:26.615
You know, people with capital
don't realize how lucky they are.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.867
I'm almost resigned to living
on what I can earn.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.786
Well, you can always marry for money.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.913
I suppose some people
make a business out of that.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.124
- I know I did.
- Why do you think she married you?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.668
Well, I was a tennis star.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.754
You've given up tennis.
She hasn't left you.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.506
She nearly did.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.633
After we married, I played...

14:44.801 --> 14:46.510
in championships and took Margot with me.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.845
She didn't like it much,
and when we got back...

14:49.013 --> 14:52.683
she tried to make me give up tennis
and play husband instead.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.268
In the end, we compromised.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.728
I went alone to America
for the grass-court season...

14:56.896 --> 14:59.731
and returned after the national championships.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.068
I soon realized that a lot had happened
while I was away.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.988
For one thing,
she wasn't in love with me anymore.

15:06.155 --> 15:10.075
There were phone calls which would end abruptly
if I happened to walk in.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.954
There was an old school friend
used to visit from time to time.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.083
One day we had a row. I wanted to play
in the covered-court tournament...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.794
and as usual, she didn't want me to go.

15:21.421 --> 15:26.258
I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.
It all sounded pretty urgent.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.177
After that, she seemed keen
that I play in the tournament after all.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.222
So I packed my kit into the car and drove off.

15:32.849 --> 15:37.728
I parked the car two streets away,
walked back in my tracks.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.398
Ten minutes later,
she came out of this house and took a taxi.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.233
I took another.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.445
Her old school friend lived
in a studio in Chelsea.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.363
I could see them through the studio window...

15:48.531 --> 15:50.866
as he cooked spaghetti over a gas ring.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.703
They didn't say much.
They just looked very natural together.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.248
You know, it's funny how you can tell
when people are in love.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.001
I went for a walk.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.630
I began to wonder what would happen
if she left me.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.966
I'd have to find some way
of earning a living to begin with.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.762
I suddenly realized how much I'd grown
to depend on her.

16:11.929 --> 16:15.349
All these expensive tastes I'd acquired
while I was at the top.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.394
And now big tennis had finished with me,
and so apparently had my wife.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.397
I can't ever remember being so scared.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.525
I dropped into a pub
and had a couple of drinks.

16:25.693 --> 16:30.197
As I sat in the corner,
I thought of all sorts of things.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.658
I thought of three different ways of killing him.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.993
I even thought of killing her.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.913
That seemed a far more sensible idea.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.208
And just as I was working out how I could do it,
I suddenly saw something...

16:41.376 --> 16:44.378
which completely changed my mind.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.342
I didn't go to that tournament after all.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.137
When I got back, she was sitting
exactly where you are now.

16:54.305 --> 16:58.266
And I told her I decided to give up tennis
and look after her instead.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.519
Well?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.730
Well, as things turned out,
I needn't have got so worked up after all.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.693
Apparently that spaghetti evening
had been a sort of a fond farewell.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.069
The boyfriend had been called
back to New York.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.445
- Ah, an American?
- Yes.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.490
There were long letters from there.

17:13.657 --> 17:17.743
They usually arrived on Thursdays.
And she burned them all except one.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.497
That one she used to transfer
from handbag to handbag.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.499
It was always with her.

17:22.666 --> 17:26.670
That letter became an obsession with me.
I had to find out what was in it.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.755
And finally I did.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.632
That letter made very interesting reading.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.635
- Do you mean you stole it?
- Yes.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.680
I even wrote her two anonymous notes
offering to sell it back.

17:36.848 --> 17:37.931
Why?

17:38.099 --> 17:41.143
I was hoping it would make her come
and tell me all about him...

17:41.310 --> 17:42.185
but it didn't.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.980
So I kept the letter.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.067
Why are you telling me all this?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.778
Because you're the only person
I can trust.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.745
Anyway, that did it.
It must have put the fear of God into them...

17:59.912 --> 18:01.288
because the letters stopped...

18:01.456 --> 18:03.665
and we lived happily ever after.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.543
It was funny to think
that just a year ago...

18:06.711 --> 18:10.255
I sat in that Knightsbridge pub
actually planning to murder her.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.424
And I might have done it...

18:12.592 --> 18:15.844
if I hadn't seen something
that changed my mind.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.221
Well? What did you see?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.807
I saw you.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.355
What was so odd about that?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.690
The coincidence.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.109
Only a week before,
I'd been to a reunion dinner...

18:31.277 --> 18:33.195
and the fellas were talking about you.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.740
How you'd been court-martialed
during the war, a year in prison.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.116
That was news.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.661
Mind you, at college, we'd all said
that old Swann would end up in jail.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.955
That cashbox, I suppose.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.207
Well, what about it?

18:45.666 --> 18:49.044
Oh, my dear fellow,
everybody knew you took that money.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.296
Poor old Alfred.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.804
Thanks very much for the drink.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.972
Interesting, hearing about
your matrimonial affairs.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.183
I take it you won't be wanting
that car after all.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.894
Don't you want me to tell you
why I brought you here?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.689
Yes, I think you'd better.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.400
It was when I saw you in that pub
that it happened.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.694
Suddenly everything became quite clear.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.282
Only a few months before,
Margot and I had made our wills...

19:19.450 --> 19:20.450
quite short affairs...

19:20.618 --> 19:23.161
leaving everything we had to each other
in case of accidents.

19:23.329 --> 19:27.874
Hers worked out at just over £90,000.
Investments mostly.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.751
All a little too easy to get at.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.171
And that was dangerous
as they'd be bound to suspect me.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.259
I needed an alibi, a very good one.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.386
Then I saw you.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.305
I often wondered what happened to people
when they came out of prison.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.851
People like you, I mean.
Can they get jobs?

19:46.018 --> 19:51.231
Do old friends rally round?
Suppose they'd never had any friends.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.442
I became so curious to know
that I followed you.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.736
I followed you home that night.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.906
And-- Would you mind
passing me your glass, old boy?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.452
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I've been following you ever since.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.620
Why?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.456
I was hoping that sooner or later
I might catch you at something...

20:08.624 --> 20:09.958
and be able to, uh....

20:10.126 --> 20:13.003
- Blackmail me?
- Influence you.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.630
After a couple of weeks,
I got to know your routine...

20:15.798 --> 20:17.257
and that made it a lot easier.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.093
- Rather dour work.
- To begin with, yes.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.304
But you know how it is.
You take up a hobby...

20:22.471 --> 20:25.348
and the more you get to know it,
the more fascinating it becomes.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.309
You became quite fascinating.

20:27.476 --> 20:31.354
In fact, there were times when I felt
that you almost belonged to me.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
That must have been interesting.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.109
You used to go to the dog racing
Mondays and Thursdays.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.737
I even took it up myself,
just to be near you.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.907
You'd changed your name to Adams.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.576
Yes. I got bored with Swann.
Any crime in that?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.745
No, no. None whatever.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.539
In fact, there was nothing
really illegal about you.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.917
I got quite discouraged.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.711
Then one day,
you disappeared from your lodgings.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.673
I phoned your landlady.
I said Mr. Adams owed me £5.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.091
But apparently that was nothing.

21:00.259 --> 21:05.055
Mr. Adams owed her six weeks' rent
and her best lodger £55.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.766
And Mr. Adams had been
such a nice gentleman.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.018
That's what seemed to upset her most.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.396
Yes. That always seems to upset them most.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.607
I say, old boy,
if you want another drink...

21:15.775 --> 21:17.901
do you mind putting on these gloves?

21:18.069 --> 21:20.028
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes, I'd lost you...

21:20.196 --> 21:22.489
and then I found you one day
at the dog racing.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.867
And I tailed you home
to your new lodgings in Belsize Park.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.370
There Mr. Adams became Mr. Wilson.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.498
Mr. Wilson left Belsize Park
owing 16 weeks' rent...

21:31.666 --> 21:35.752
and somewhat richer
for a brief encounter with a Miss Wallace.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.047
You used to take Miss Wallace out
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.591
She certainly was in love with you,
wasn't she?

21:41.759 --> 21:45.679
I suppose she thought you were growing
that handsome mustache to please her.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.764
Poor Miss Wallace.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.183
This is all very interesting.
Do go on.

21:50.351 --> 21:54.813
July, August, September.
Apartment 127, Carlisle Court.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.815
Occupant, a Mrs. Van Dorn.

21:56.983 --> 22:01.236
Her late husband left her two hotels
and a large apartment house, furnished.

22:01.404 --> 22:04.030
What a base to operate from, Captain Lesgate.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.075
The only trouble is,
she does rather enjoy being courted...

22:07.243 --> 22:08.910
and she's so very expensive.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.956
Perhaps that's why you've been trying
to sell her car for over a month.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.375
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me to sell it for her.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.461
I know. I called her up
just before you arrived here.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.046
She only wanted 800.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.802
Where's the nearest police station?

22:25.970 --> 22:27.971
Opposite the church. Two minutes' walk.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.599
- Suppose I walk there now.
- What would you tell them?

22:31.767 --> 22:32.600
Everything.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.852
Everything?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.062
All about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson?

22:37.231 --> 22:40.483
I should simply tell them
that you're trying to blackmail me into--

22:40.651 --> 22:41.943
Into?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.404
Murdering your wife.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.157
I almost wish you would.
When she heard that...

22:47.324 --> 22:49.242
we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.578
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Am I?

22:51.746 --> 22:54.330
- You've told me quite a lot tonight.
- What of it?

22:54.498 --> 22:57.459
Suppose I tell them how you followed her
to that studio in Chelsea...

22:57.626 --> 22:59.961
and watched them cooking spaghetti,
and all that rubbish?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.964
- Will that ring a bell?
- Oh, it certainly would.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.883
They'd assume you followed her yourself.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.677
- Me? Why should I?
- Why should you steal her handbag?

23:07.845 --> 23:09.846
Why should you write her
all those blackmail notes?

23:10.681 --> 23:15.226
Can you prove you didn't?
You certainly can't prove I did.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.604
It'd be a straight case
of your word against mine.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.066
That would puzzle them, wouldn't it?
What could you say?

23:21.776 --> 23:24.611
I shall simply say
that you came here tonight half-drunk...

23:24.779 --> 23:26.196
and, uh, tried to borrow money...

23:26.363 --> 23:28.406
on the strength
that we were at college together.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.408
When I refused, you mentioned something...

23:30.576 --> 23:32.452
about a letter belonging to my wife.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.455
As far as I could make out,
you tried to sell it to me.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.875
I gave you what money I had
and you gave me the letter.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.461
It has your fingerprints on it, remember?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.925
Then you said if I went to the police...

23:47.093 --> 23:50.470
you'd tell some crazy story
about my wanting you to murder my wife.

23:51.097 --> 23:55.809
But before you go any further, old boy,
do consider the inconvenience.

23:55.976 --> 24:00.563
You see, I'm quite well-known.
And there'd be pictures of you as well.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.858
And sooner or later, there'd be
a deputation of landladies and lodgers...

24:04.026 --> 24:06.778
who would step forward
to testify to your character.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.616
And someone is almost certain
to have seen you with Miss Wallace.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.328
You were careful not to be seen
around with her, I noticed.

24:15.496 --> 24:19.374
You usually met in out-of-the-way places
where you wouldn't be recognized...

24:20.417 --> 24:23.086
like the little tea shop in Pimlico.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.004
That was her idea, not mine.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.048
Yes, it was a bit crummy, wasn't it?

24:27.216 --> 24:29.676
Hardly the place to take Mrs. Van Dorn.

24:29.844 --> 24:33.555
By the way, does Mrs. Van Dorn
know about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson...

24:33.722 --> 24:35.265
and Miss Wallace?

24:35.432 --> 24:38.059
You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn,
weren't you?

24:38.227 --> 24:40.186
- Smart, aren't you?
- No, not really.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.149
I've just had time to think things out,
put myself in your position.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.818
That's why I know you're going to agree.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.195
What makes you think I'll agree?

24:49.363 --> 24:52.574
For the same reason that a donkey
with a stick behind him and a carrot in front...

24:52.741 --> 24:55.577
always goes forwards and not backwards.

24:56.078 --> 25:00.373
- Tell me about the carrot.
- One thousand pounds in cash.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.958
For a murder?

25:02.126 --> 25:05.837
For a few minutes' work, that's all it is.
And no risk, I guarantee.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.966
That ought to appeal to you.
You've been skating on pretty thin ice.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.064
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:12.065 --> 25:14.429
You ought to know.
It was in all the papers.

25:14.597 --> 25:17.640
Middle-aged woman found dead
due to an overdose of something.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.976
She had been taking the stuff
for quite some time...

25:20.144 --> 25:21.603
and nobody knows where she got it.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.189
But we know, don't we?

25:25.107 --> 25:27.150
Poor Miss Wallace.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.406
This £1000. Where is it?

25:34.909 --> 25:37.577
It's in a small attaché case in a checkroom.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.912
Where?

25:39.079 --> 25:40.580
Somewhere in London.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.582
Of course we don't meet again.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.084
As soon as you've delivered the goods...

25:45.252 --> 25:48.838
I shall mail you the checkroom ticket
and the key to the case.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.841
You can take this £100 on account.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.640
The police would only have to trace
one of these notes back to you...

25:58.807 --> 26:00.725
to hang us both from the same rope.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.143
They won't.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.938
For a whole year,
I've been cashing an extra £20 a week.

26:05.105 --> 26:09.400
Always in fivers.
I then change them for those at my leisure.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.861
Let me see your bank statement?

26:12.029 --> 26:13.404
By all means.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.036
Don't touch.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.501
Turn back a page.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.885
Ah. Your balance has dropped
by over £1000 during the year.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.637
Suppose the police ask you about that.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.014
I go dog racing twice a week.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.724
They'll check your bookmaker.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.018
Like you, I always bet on the tout.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.728
Satisfied?

26:48.399 --> 26:49.983
When would this take place?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.359
Tomorrow night.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.611
Tomorrow? Not a chance.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.446
I've gotta think this over.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.492
It has to be tomorrow.
I've arranged things that way.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.619
Where?

27:02.496 --> 27:04.247
Approximately where you're standing now.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.625
How?

27:07.793 --> 27:10.211
Tomorrow evening, Halliday,
the American boyfriend, and I...

27:10.379 --> 27:13.673
will go out to a stag party.
She'll stay here.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.759
She'll go to bed early and listen to
<i>Saturday Night Theatre</i> on the radio.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.636
She always does when I'm out.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.305
At exactly three minutes to 11...

27:20.472 --> 27:22.765
you'll enter the house
through the street door.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.268
You'll find the key to this door...

27:28.314 --> 27:30.565
under the stair carpet here.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.401
- The fifth step.
- That's the one.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.654
Go straight to the window...

27:37.823 --> 27:39.073
and hide behind the curtains.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.117
At exactly 11:00...

27:41.285 --> 27:43.953
I shall go to the telephone in the hotel
to call my boss.

27:44.121 --> 27:48.291
I shall dial the wrong number, this number.
That's all I shall do.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.751
When the phone rings...

27:49.918 --> 27:52.920
you'll see the light go on
under her bedroom door.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.299
When she opens it,
the light will stream across the room.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.302
So don't move until she answers the phone.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.096
There must be as little noise as possible.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.140
After you've finished...

28:04.308 --> 28:07.268
pick up the phone
and give me a soft whistle, and hang up.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.021
Don't speak, whatever you do.
I shan't say a word.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.066
When I hear your whistle,
I shall hang up and redial...

28:13.233 --> 28:15.151
but the correct number this time.

28:15.319 --> 28:19.113
I shall then talk to my boss as if
nothing had happened and return to the party.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.032
Well, what happens next? Go on.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.284
You'll see the suitcase here.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.620
It contains some clothes of mine
for the cleaners.

28:25.788 --> 28:29.290
Open it and tip the clothes out
onto the floor.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.168
Fill it with a cigarette box
and some of these cups.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.380
Close the lid, but don't snap the locks.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.757
Then leave the suitcase there
just as it is now.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.176
- Ah, as if I'd left in a hurry.
- That's the idea.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.844
Now the window.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.973
If it's locked,
unlock it and leave it open.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.102
Then go out exactly the same way
you came in.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.437
- By this door?
- Yes.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.564
And here's the most important thing:

28:53.982 --> 28:57.026
As you go out, return the key
to the place where you found it.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.445
- Under the stair carpet?
- Yes.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.115
Yes, but what exactly
is supposed to have happened?

29:02.950 --> 29:06.035
They'll assume you came in by the window.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.745
You thought the apartment was empty...

29:07.913 --> 29:10.289
so you took the suitcase
and went to work.

29:10.457 --> 29:14.836
She heard something.
She switched on her light.

29:15.003 --> 29:18.256
You saw the light under the door
and hid behind the curtains.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.385
When she came in here,
you attacked her before she could scream.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.346
When you realized you'd actually killed her...

29:25.514 --> 29:27.306
you panicked, bolted through the garden...

29:27.474 --> 29:29.684
- and left the loot behind you.
- Just a minute.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.688
I'm supposed to have come in
through these windows.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.358
- Suppose they'd been locked.
- It wouldn't matter.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.278
You see, she often walks around the garden
before she goes to bed...

29:40.446 --> 29:43.364
and she usually forgets to lock up
when she gets back.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.533
That's what I shall tell the police.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.161
Yes, but she may say that....

29:49.496 --> 29:52.790
But she isn't going to say anything, is she?

29:56.420 --> 29:59.922
All right. I leave the apartment.

30:00.090 --> 30:04.177
I put the key back under the stair carpet
and go out by the street door.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.430
Suppose the street door's locked.
How do I get in in the first place?

30:07.598 --> 30:09.140
The street door is never locked.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.559
- What time will you get back?
- About 12.

30:11.727 --> 30:14.437
I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap
so we'll find her together.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.814
And we shall have been together
since we left her...

30:16.982 --> 30:18.983
and there's my alibi.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.791
- You've forgotten something.
- What?

30:35.959 --> 30:38.669
When you get back with
what's-his-name, Halliday...

30:38.837 --> 30:41.797
- how will you get into the apartment?
- I shall let myself in.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.925
But your key will be under
the stair carpet.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.260
He'll see you getting it out.
It'll give the show away.

30:46.428 --> 30:49.972
No. It won't be my key under the carpet,
it'll be hers.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.683
I shall take it from her handbag
and hide it out there...

30:52.851 --> 30:54.685
just before I leave the flat.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.522
She's not going out,
so she won't miss it.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.651
When I come back with Halliday,
I'll use my own key to let us in.

31:01.818 --> 31:05.154
Then while he's out searching the garden
or something...

31:05.322 --> 31:08.574
I'll take the key from under the carpet
and return it to her handbag...

31:08.742 --> 31:10.326
before the police arrive.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.203
How many keys are there to this door?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.788
Just hers and mine.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.006
Maida Vale Z499.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.717
- <i>Tony, it's me.</i>
- Oh, hello, darling. How's it going?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.804
<i>Wonderfully. It's really a splendid play.</i>

31:29.972 --> 31:33.683
- <i>We're enjoying every minute.</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm glad.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.434
<i>You will join us, won't you?</i>

31:35.602 --> 31:38.062
Well, I don't think so.
I hardly seem to have started.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.481
Oh, darling, just a moment,
I think someone's at the door.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.943
You can be seen from the bedroom window.

31:45.612 --> 31:49.115
Sorry, darling. False alarm.
Look, why don't you take Mark to Gerry's?

31:49.283 --> 31:51.784
- <i>How do we get in?</i>
- Well, just mention my name.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.579
I don't know about the band,
but the food's good.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.789
By the way, Maureen called up
just after you left...

31:56.957 --> 31:59.292
and wants us for dinner on Wednesday.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.919
But you've got something written
in your diary for Wednesday...

32:02.087 --> 32:05.298
and I can't read your writing.
Looks like Al Bentall.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.092
Who's he, another one of your boyfriends?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.428
<i>Albert Hall, you idiot.</i>

32:10.596 --> 32:12.888
Oh, the Albert Hall, of course.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.849
I'm so glad we don't have to go to Maureen's.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.350
She's such a filthy cook.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.227
<i>Oh, there's the bell. I must fly.</i>

32:18.478 --> 32:20.730
All right, dear. Enjoy yourself.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.420
Tony, don't make that martini too watery.

33:28.882 --> 33:32.385
Oh, now, where's the picture
of the maharaja?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.763
Darling, when are you gonna finish pasting
in those clippings?

33:35.931 --> 33:39.225
Oh, I shall find time one of these days.
Oh, here it is.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.894
This is the maharaja. Isn't he dreamy?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.647
He had four Rolls-Royces
and enough jewels to sink a battleship...

33:44.815 --> 33:46.607
but all he wanted was to play at Wimbledon.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.443
The poor darling. He was so shortsighted,

33:48.444 --> 33:50.194
he could barely see the end of the racket...

33:50.362 --> 33:51.320
let alone the ball.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.073
You know, you should, um....
Thanks, Tony.

33:54.241 --> 33:57.368
- You should write a book about all this.
- Why don't you two collaborate?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.495
A detective novel with a tennis...

33:59.663 --> 34:01.163
- background.
- What about it, Mark?

34:01.331 --> 34:03.082
Would you provide me
with the perfect murder?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.625
Nothing I'd like better.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.502
How do you write a detective story?

34:07.003 --> 34:10.214
Well, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. 
Crime's the thing.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.134
Then you imagine you're going to steal
something or murder somebody.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.302
Oh, is that how you do it? Interesting.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.723
Yes, I usually put myself
in the criminal's shoes and ask myself, um:

34:18.889 --> 34:19.931
"What do I do next?"

34:20.601 --> 34:22.601
Do you really believe in the perfect murder?

34:22.768 --> 34:25.896
Mm. Yes, absolutely. On paper, that is.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.440
And I think I could plan one better
than most people...

34:28.608 --> 34:32.695
- but I doubt if I could carry it out.
- Oh? Why not?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.239
Well, in stories, things turn out
the way the author wants.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.658
And in real life, they don't always.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.326
- Hm.
- No, I'm afraid my murders...

34:39.494 --> 34:40.536
would be like my bridge.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.206
I'd make a stupid mistake and never realize
till I found everybody was looking at me.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.583
- We better drink up, Mark.
- Yes.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.878
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Mm. Nothing I know of.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.963
Why don't we all drive down
to Windsor for lunch?

34:51.130 --> 34:53.340
That's a good idea.
Come along early, but not too early.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.676
- We may be nursing a hangover.
- How about 11?

34:55.844 --> 34:56.802
Fine.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.679
We'll have lunch at the King's Head.

34:58.847 --> 34:59.805
Is that in Windsor?

34:59.973 --> 35:01.682
- No, it's just outside.
- Oh.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.395
Did I lend you my latchkey?
I can't seem to find it anywhere.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.564
I don't know.
I may have them both in my handbag.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.316
I'll just look.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.588
No. I've only got one here.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.381
Are you sure yours isn't in your overcoat?

35:34.549 --> 35:36.717
No, I've looked. May I borrow yours?

35:36.885 --> 35:39.178
- Well, that's a bit awkward.
- Why?

35:39.346 --> 35:40.387
I may want to go out.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.265
- Tonight?
- I thought I might...

35:43.433 --> 35:44.809
go to a movie or something.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.144
Won't you listen to the radio?
<i>Saturday Night Theatre?</i>

35:47.312 --> 35:50.272
Oh, no. It's a thriller.
I don't like thrillers when I'm alone.

35:50.941 --> 35:53.234
- I see.
- Well, in any case...

35:53.401 --> 35:55.152
I'll be back before you.
I can let you in.

35:55.612 --> 35:58.697
But we won't be back until after midnight.
You may be asleep by then.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.075
You can always put your key
under the proverbial mat.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.243
No, it's all right.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.703
Here it is.
It was in my glove all the time.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.164
Well, that settles that.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.083
What movie are you going to?

36:09.251 --> 36:10.835
Oh, <i>The Classic,</i> I expect.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.962
Will you get in? Saturday night?

36:13.129 --> 36:14.797
- Oh, I can always try.
- Oh, but, darling--

36:14.965 --> 36:17.800
Now, don't make me stay home.
You know how I hate doing nothing.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.386
Doing nothing? Why, there are
hundreds of things you can do.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.721
Have you written to Peggy
thanking her for the weekend?

36:22.889 --> 36:25.808
And what about those clippings?
It's an ideal opportunity.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.394
Well, I like that.
You two go gallivanting...

36:28.562 --> 36:31.647
while I stay home
and do those boring clippings.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.483
Very well. We won't go.

36:34.651 --> 36:35.693
What do you mean?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.653
You don't want us to go out...

36:37.821 --> 36:39.738
so we won't.
We'll stay here with you instead.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.240
What shall we do, play cards?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.868
Oh, Tony, darling.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.620
Well, I'd better call the Grendon
and tell them we're not coming.

36:46.788 --> 36:50.833
Oh, Tony, please,
let's not be childish about this.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.628
All right, I'll do your old press clippings.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.007
You don't have to
if you don't want to, you know.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.426
But I do want to.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.932
I think I'll try and scare up a taxi.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.560
- Have we any paste?
- There's some in the desk...

37:09.728 --> 37:11.103
I believe.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.773
- You'll need some scissors.
- Oh, they're in my mending basket.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.799
Lend me some change, dear.
I need some money for the taxi.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.385
Hey, you leave my bag alone.
How much do you need anyway?

37:43.553 --> 37:44.970
Well, let's see how much you've got.

37:45.738 --> 37:47.514
- Put that down.
- You owe me 10 bob anyway.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.683
- For what?
- I paid for that package you sent Peggy.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.802
- That comes out of housekeeping.
- Let me give it to you.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.103
Keep your hands off.

37:54.648 --> 37:55.522
There now.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.732
How much do you want?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.901
Well, I've got 3, 5, 7 and sixpence.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.444
Enough to get us there and back.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.988
You'd better take something.
How much are the dinner tickets?

38:03.156 --> 38:07.326
Already paid for, tip included.
If I run short, Mark will help out.

38:10.038 --> 38:10.996
Taxi's here.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.545
What are you waiting for?

38:18.713 --> 38:20.005
Oh, nothing, dear. Nothing.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.131
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.467
- What time will you get home?
- About 12, I should think.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.844
I'll bring Mark back for a nightcap
on his way home.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.389
I'll be fast asleep
and I don't want to be disturbed.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.890
We shall be as quiet as mice.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.642
- Night.
- Night.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.396
Uh....

38:36.690 --> 38:37.606
Margot?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.191
Yes?

38:39.776 --> 38:41.986
It's quite possible
old man Burgess might call.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.113
Tell him we're at the Grendon.
Might be important.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.865
- What's the number? All right.
- It's in the book.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.454
Goodbye, dear.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.500
All right, Mark.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.301
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
Know the Torbay Hotel in Dartmoor?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.638
Well, it's not exactly in Dartmoor,
but sort of in the district...

41:14.806 --> 41:17.099
if you know what I mean.
The point of this story is...

41:17.267 --> 41:18.892
that it concerns Dartmoor Prison.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.269
Anyway...

41:20.436 --> 41:23.105
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
I went to the bar one day....

41:35.660 --> 41:37.619
So I turned and said,
"What are you doing here?"

41:37.787 --> 41:40.122
He said, "I'm a commercial traveler.
I sell...

41:40.290 --> 41:41.540
agricultural machinery."

41:41.708 --> 41:42.666
I said, "Agricultural"--

41:42.834 --> 41:44.793
Excuse me. Any of you fellas
have the right time?

41:44.961 --> 41:50.299
- Yes, I have seven minutes past 11.
- I make it only just after 11.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.801
Well, my watch has stopped.
I must have overwound it.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.678
So as I was saying--

41:54.846 --> 41:56.597
Excuse me, old boy.
I have to call my boss.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.140
Agricultural machinery....

43:14.467 --> 43:16.009
Hello.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.388
Hello?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.809
Hello?

43:29.565 --> 43:30.899
Hello?

43:33.653 --> 43:35.153
Hello?

43:36.781 --> 43:38.156
<i>Hello?</i>

43:41.494 --> 43:42.744
Hello?

44:44.223 --> 44:46.683
<i>Get the police. Quickly. Police.</i>

44:48.895 --> 44:51.563
- Margot?
- <i>Who's there?</i>

44:51.731 --> 44:53.065
Darling, it's me.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.776
Oh, Tony. 

44:55.943 --> 45:00.113
Tony, thank God. Come back at once.

45:00.490 --> 45:01.531
What's the matter?

45:01.699 --> 45:05.827
<i>I can't explain now.
Come quickly, please.</i>

45:05.995 --> 45:08.747
Now, darling, pull yourself together.
What is it?

45:08.915 --> 45:13.168
<i>A man attacked me.
He tried to strangle me.</i>

45:13.961 --> 45:15.754
Did he get away?

45:16.255 --> 45:19.383
<i>No. He's dead. He's dead.</i>

45:26.391 --> 45:27.891
Tony, are you still there?

45:28.684 --> 45:30.727
- Margot.
- <i>Yes?</i>

45:30.895 --> 45:32.896
Now, listen very carefully.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.439
<i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

45:34.607 --> 45:36.775
Don't touch anything.
I'll be with you right away.

45:37.735 --> 45:38.985
No. No, I won't.

45:39.153 --> 45:43.407
<i>Don't touch anything
and don't speak to anybody until I get there.</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:46.827
- No, I won't touch anything.
- <i>You promise?</i>

45:46.994 --> 45:50.705
Yes, I promise.
Only, please, be quick.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.094
I'm sitting at the same bar...

46:46.262 --> 46:48.180
and I see the same man
standing at the end...

46:48.347 --> 46:50.015
and he came across to me and said--

46:50.183 --> 46:51.850
No, do sit down. I have to run along.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.602
It's Margot. She's not feeling well.

46:53.769 --> 46:54.895
- Serious?
- Nothing serious.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.271
- You stay and enjoy.
- I'll come.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.231
No, it's perfectly all right.

46:58.774 --> 47:02.652
--with which he was buying me
dry martinis. Anyway....

47:31.641 --> 47:34.059
Tony! Oh, Tony. 

47:34.227 --> 47:37.562
It's all right, darling. It's all right.
What happened?

47:37.730 --> 47:41.483
He put something around my throat.
It felt like a stocking.

47:41.651 --> 47:44.110
Are you sure? Let me see.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.696
I got up to answer the phone...

47:46.864 --> 47:49.824
and he came from behind the curtain
and tried to strangle me.

47:50.701 --> 47:51.368
I almost...

47:51.536 --> 47:52.786
passed out.

47:52.954 --> 47:54.788
I felt the scissors in my hands.

47:54.956 --> 47:56.206
Then he let go suddenly...

47:56.374 --> 47:59.501
and he fell on the floor.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.949
There's hardly any blood.

48:31.576 --> 48:34.119
When he fell, he must have--
What are you doing?

48:34.287 --> 48:35.745
I'm trying to find my....

48:35.913 --> 48:39.791
Oh, here they are. My aspirin.
I've got such an awful head.

48:56.225 --> 48:57.309
What is it?

48:57.476 --> 48:59.436
I'd better get a blanket.

49:14.994 --> 49:16.369
Shut the window, please.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.789
No, we mustn't touch anything
till the police arrive.

49:19.957 --> 49:23.293
He must've broken in.
I wonder what he was after.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.669
Those cups, I expect.

49:25.087 --> 49:26.421
When will the police get here?

49:27.381 --> 49:28.548
Have you called them already?

49:28.716 --> 49:31.593
No. You told me not to speak to anyone.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.347
Hadn't you better call them now?

49:35.514 --> 49:36.931
Yes.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.561
- Where's Mark?
- I told him to go straight home.

49:41.729 --> 49:42.604
<i>Operator.</i>

49:42.772 --> 49:45.190
Hello, operator.
Get me the Maida Vale Police, quickly.

49:45.358 --> 49:46.066
Did you tell him?

49:46.442 --> 49:49.361
No, I didn't know what had happened.
I just said you weren't feeling well.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.904
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>

49:51.072 --> 49:53.657
Oh, police, there's been a ghastly accident.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.867
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>
- A man has been killed.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.911
- <i>Your name, sir?</i>
- Wendice.

49:58.663 --> 50:00.789
- <i>Is that a double "S"?</i>
- No, D-I-C-E.

50:00.956 --> 50:02.791
C-E. Your address, sir?

50:02.958 --> 50:06.461
<i>61-A Charrington Gardens,
the ground floor apartment.</i>

50:06.629 --> 50:07.462
Was it an accident?

50:08.464 --> 50:09.547
I don't know.

50:09.965 --> 50:11.675
What do you mean, sir, you don't know?

50:11.842 --> 50:13.968
You think he might have been killed by someone?

50:14.136 --> 50:17.013
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

50:17.181 --> 50:19.641
<i>Well, have you any idea
who might have done it?</i>

50:24.105 --> 50:26.314
I'll explain that when you come.
How long will it take?

50:26.482 --> 50:28.108
- <i>About two minutes.</i>
- Two minutes?

50:28.275 --> 50:30.318
And don't touch anything, will you, sir?

50:30.486 --> 50:32.487
No, we won't touch anything. Goodbye.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.447
I'll get dressed.

50:34.615 --> 50:36.032
Why?

50:36.659 --> 50:37.784
They'll want to see me.

50:37.952 --> 50:41.287
- They're not going to see you.
- But they'll have to ask me questions.

50:41.455 --> 50:44.582
They can wait till tomorrow.
I'll tell them all they need to know.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.043
- Tony.
- Yes?

50:47.211 --> 50:48.253
Why did you phone me?

50:49.171 --> 50:49.921
What?

50:50.256 --> 50:52.924
I'm sorry, darling,
I'll tell you about that later.

50:53.092 --> 50:56.302
I just thought of something.
You said he used a stocking?

50:56.470 --> 50:59.431
I think it was a stocking or a scarf.
Isn't it there?

50:59.598 --> 51:03.601
No, but I expect they'll find it.
Now, you go on to bed.

53:40.301 --> 53:41.968
Tea, gentlemen?

54:00.779 --> 54:02.030
- Sergeant.
- Mm-hm?

54:02.197 --> 54:04.532
Look, it's the other stocking.

54:22.009 --> 54:24.844
All right, break it up.
Let's get moving on.

54:48.786 --> 54:51.871
Hm. Almost empty.
Remind me to get some more.

54:52.039 --> 54:53.748
It always runs out just when we need it.

54:53.916 --> 54:56.501
Oh, look, before I forget,
the sergeant wanted to know...

54:56.669 --> 54:58.503
why you didn't phone the police immediately.

54:58.671 --> 55:01.089
- How could I? You were on the phone.
- I know, but--

55:01.256 --> 55:03.883
You distinctly told me
not to speak to anyone until you got here.

55:04.051 --> 55:07.303
I know, darling, but I told him
a slightly different story.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.262
Why?

55:08.430 --> 55:11.015
Well, I said you didn't phone the police
because you assumed...

55:11.183 --> 55:13.059
that I would do it from the hotel.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.560
Why did you say that?

55:14.728 --> 55:17.981
Because it was the perfectly logical explanation,
and he accepted it.

55:18.148 --> 55:21.484
Now, if they get the idea
that we delayed reporting it...

55:21.652 --> 55:24.237
they might get nosy
and start asking all sorts of questions--

55:24.405 --> 55:26.044
So you want me to say the same thing?

55:26.045 --> 55:28.157
I think so, dear, in case it comes up again.

55:29.410 --> 55:31.619
Oh, that'll be Mark.
Would you let him in?

55:35.708 --> 55:36.833
Good morning, madam.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.334
Oh. Good morning.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.086
- Mrs. Wendice?
- Yes.

55:40.254 --> 55:43.881
- I'm a police officer. May I come in?
- Of course.

55:49.430 --> 55:51.556
Excuse me.
I'll just tell my husband you're here.

55:51.724 --> 55:53.182
Oh, thank you.

56:17.041 --> 56:17.957
Good morning.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.168
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard...

56:20.335 --> 56:22.670
in charge of criminal investigation
of this division.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.173
We gave your sergeant
all the necessary information.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.050
Yes. I've seen his report, of course...

56:27.217 --> 56:31.012
but there are a few things
I'd like to get firsthand.

56:31.346 --> 56:35.016
I gather the sergeant only saw you
for a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?

56:35.184 --> 56:36.225
Yes, I--

56:36.393 --> 56:38.394
My wife was suffering from considerable shock.

56:38.562 --> 56:41.189
Yes, that was a very nasty experience you had.

56:41.356 --> 56:42.899
Do you mind if I take a look around?

56:43.067 --> 56:45.693
Go ahead. The bedroom and bathroom
are through here.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.042
He certainly didn't get in by the bathroom.

57:06.006 --> 57:08.549
And the kitchen has bars on the window.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.557
We assume he must have come in
through these windows here.

57:16.725 --> 57:19.268
I, uh-- I understand you weren't here
when this happened.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.938
No, I was at a dinner party
at the Grendon Hotel.

57:22.106 --> 57:23.356
And by a curious coincidence...

57:23.524 --> 57:25.691
I was actually phoning my wife
when she was attacked.

57:25.859 --> 57:28.903
So I gather. Can you tell me
exactly what time it was, sir?

57:29.071 --> 57:33.074
No, I'm afraid I can't.
I do remember my watch had stopped.

57:35.911 --> 57:38.246
Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?

57:39.164 --> 57:40.039
No, I didn't.

57:40.207 --> 57:41.582
Won't you sit down, inspector?

57:42.084 --> 57:43.584
Thank you.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.506
Have you any idea who he was?

57:49.424 --> 57:53.386
Hmm? Oh, yes. At least,
we've discovered where he lived.

57:53.554 --> 57:56.681
There still seems to be some confusion
as to his real name.

57:56.849 --> 57:58.683
- Oh?
- He appeared to have several.

58:00.185 --> 58:03.604
- Had you ever seen him before?
- Why, no, of course not.

58:05.816 --> 58:06.858
Oh.

58:07.025 --> 58:08.901
- Is this him?
- Yes.

58:09.069 --> 58:12.488
- You don't recognize him?
- No, I never saw him.

58:12.781 --> 58:15.199
But didn't you even catch
a glimpse of his face?

58:15.367 --> 58:17.368
No. You see, he attacked me from behind...

58:17.536 --> 58:20.454
and it was dark.
I hardly saw him at all.

58:20.622 --> 58:24.250
But before I showed you these photographs,
you said you'd never seen him...

58:24.418 --> 58:25.168
before.

58:25.335 --> 58:28.629
How could you know that
if you never saw his face last night?

58:28.797 --> 58:30.089
I don't quite understand.

58:30.257 --> 58:32.842
Inspector, my wife simply means
that as far as she knew...

58:33.010 --> 58:34.886
she never saw him before.

58:35.053 --> 58:36.762
- Was that what you meant?
- Yes.

58:36.930 --> 58:39.640
Yeah. Now, how about you, sir?
Had you ever seen him before?

58:40.934 --> 58:41.767
No.

58:44.855 --> 58:45.521
No.

58:46.064 --> 58:47.565
- At least....
- Yes?

58:47.900 --> 58:50.193
It's very like someone
I was at college with.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.153
But the mustache makes quite a difference.

58:52.404 --> 58:53.738
Oh? What was his name?

58:53.906 --> 58:56.699
Oh, I don't know.
It must be 20 years since I left.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.994
- Was it, uh, Lesgate?
- No.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.954
- Wilson?
- No.

59:02.122 --> 59:02.788
Swann?

59:02.956 --> 59:05.291
N-- Swann?

59:06.418 --> 59:09.420
Wait a minute. Swann.
Yes, that's it.

59:14.468 --> 59:17.470
Here's an old photo taken at a reunion.
We were at the same college together.

59:17.638 --> 59:18.804
There he is there.

59:18.972 --> 59:21.724
- Why, it's unbelievable.
- Did you know him well?

59:21.892 --> 59:23.267
No. He was senior to me.

59:23.435 --> 59:25.394
- Have you met him since then?
- No.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.104
At least....

59:27.272 --> 59:30.358
Come to think of it, I did see him
quite recently, but not to speak to.

59:30.525 --> 59:33.611
- Oh? When was that?
- Six months ago at a railway station.

59:33.779 --> 59:34.946
Victoria, I think.

59:35.364 --> 59:37.490
I remember noticing how little he'd changed.

59:37.658 --> 59:40.534
- Had he a mustache then, sir?
- No.

59:40.869 --> 59:44.914
Hm. Uh, Mrs. Wendice, would you show me
exactly what happened last night?

59:45.707 --> 59:48.834
- Tony, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so, darling.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.636
I was in bed when the phone rang,
and I got up and I came in here.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.888
- Did you switch this light on?
- No.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:03.599
Just show me exactly
where you were standing.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.983
I stood here and I picked up the phone.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.109
Just one moment.

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.611
Are you sure you had your back
to the window like that?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.321
Yes.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.699
- But why?
- Why not?

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:24.912
I mean, why go around the desk?
I should have picked it up from this side.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.998
But I always answer the phone from here.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.416
But why?

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:32.545
In case I have to write anything down.
I can hold the phone in my left hand.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:37.300
I see. I'm sorry. Go on.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.884
When I picked up the phone...

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.388
he must have come from behind those curtains
and attacked me.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:45.391
- He got something around my neck.
- What do you mean by "something"?

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.601
I think it was a stocking.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.146
I see. And what happened then?

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.190
Well, then he pushed me across the desk.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.192
I distinctly remember feeling for the scissors.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.361
Where were those scissors usually kept?

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:00.823
In that mending basket.
I'd forgotten to put them away.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.243
Now, what makes you think
he came from behind those curtains?

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.870
Where else could he have been?

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:07.204
- The curtains were drawn?
- Yes.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:08.622
Did you draw them yourself?

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.958
No, inspector, I drew them
just before I went out.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.461
- Did you lock the window at the same time?
- Yes.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.046
Are you quite sure of that, sir?

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.882
Oh, perfectly sure. I always lock up
when I draw the curtains.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.801
- Then how do you suppose he got in?
- We assume that he broke in.

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.511
Well, there's no sign of a break-in.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:25.514
Our report shows the lock's quite undamaged.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:26.640
Mrs. Wendice...

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.185
why didn't you call the police...

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.062
immediately this happened?

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:36.859
I was trying to get through to the police...

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.236
when I discovered my husband
was on the line.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:42.073
I naturally thought he would call the police
from the hotel...

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.033
before he came here.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.328
Uh, didn't it occur to you
to call a doctor?

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:49.413
- No.
- Why ever not?

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.833
- He was dead.
- How did you know that?

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.127
I.... It was obvious.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:58.172
- Did you feel his pulse?
- No, of course I didn't.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.009
Anyone would have realized he was dead.
Just one look at those staring eyes--

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.136
Oh, so you did see his face, after all.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:07.515
I saw his eyes!
I can't remember his face!

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.601
Inspector, my wife obviously
had never seen this man before.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.978
If he didn't come in by those windows,
how did he get in?

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:19.318
As a matter of fact, we're quite certain
that he came in by this door.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.862
But it was locked.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.949
Margot, did you open that door
at all after we'd gone?

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:25.866
No.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:28.869
- How many keys are there to this door?
- Only two.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.664
Mine was in my handbag,
and you had yours with you.

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.582
Yes, that's right.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.793
- Has the caretaker got a key?
- No.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.294
Do you employ a charwoman?

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:40.631
Yes, but she hasn't got one either.
I'm always here when she comes.

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.508
What makes you think he came in this way?

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.302
His shoes.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:46.512
His shoes?

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.974
The ground was soaking wet last night.

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:53.686
And if he'd come in by the garden,
he'd have left mud all over the carpet.

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.813
As it is, he didn't leave
any marks at all...

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.315
because he wiped his shoes
on the front doormat.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:02:59.358
How can you tell?

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:02.945
It's a fairly new mat
and some of its fibers came off on his shoes.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:03.779
Oh, but surely--

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:08.159
And there was a small tar stain on the mat,
and some of the fibers show that as well.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.785
No, there's no question about it.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.999
Wait a minute. I think I've got it.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.418
You remember when your bag was stolen?

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:18.252
Yes.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.713
Wasn't the key inside?

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:23.090
Yes, but it was still there
when I got it back.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.926
Now, just a moment.
I'd like to hear about this.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.219
What sort of bag?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.763
A handbag, inspector.
My wife lost it at Victoria Station.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.975
But I got it back from the lost
and found about two weeks later.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:33.976
Was anything missing?

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:35.936
All the money was gone.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.480
- Anything else?
- No.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.858
- I mean, no papers or letters?
- No.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.943
Are you quite sure about that?

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.069
Yes.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.739
Your latchkey was in your handbag
when you lost it?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:49.158
Yes, but it was still there
when it was returned.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.494
Whoever stole the money
could have copied the key.

01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:53.829
Where was the bag found eventually?

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.956
At Victoria Station.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.375
Wasn't that where you said
you saw this man, sir?

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.753
When did you lose the bag?

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:03.130
Wasn't it that weekend
we went to visit Peggy?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:06.300
Yes, it was. I remember now.
He was sitting in the restaurant.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.843
That where you left your bag?

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:11.472
Yes, and didn't I say something about
"There's someone I was at college with"?

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.766
I don't remember.

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:15.851
That's how he got in.
He had a duplicate made...

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.104
- and returned the original to the bag.
- Before you go any further...

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.649
how did he get in
through the street door?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.526
Well, the street door is never locked.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.236
I see.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:28.155
He could have had your key copied...

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:31.492
and he could have used it
to open the door...

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.828
but of course he didn't.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:36.121
Why not?

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.122
Because if he had...

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.500
the key would still have been on him
when he died.

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:41.502
No key was found when we went
through his pockets.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.133
We seem to be back just where we started,
don't we?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.469
Well, not quite.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.513
Well, then how did he get in?

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.558
We'd better get all this down on paper.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.977
I'd like you both to make
an official statement...

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.520
before the inquest.

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:02.439
My office is only a few moments from here.
Perhaps you could come now.

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.363
- Tony.
- Mark. Oh, this is Inspector Hubbard.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:12.074
Inspector, this is Mark Halliday.
He was with me last night.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.325
How do you do, inspector?

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:17.121
As you were with Mr. Wendice last night,
you may be able to help us here.

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:20.874
Now, did you notice what time it was
he went to the phone?

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.544
Yes, matter of fact,
it was just three minutes after 11.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:25.629
How did you come to notice that?

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:28.674
Well, Mr. Wendice's watch had stopped
and some of us compared times.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.802
Thank you. So you see,
it was when Mrs. Wendice came in here...

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.847
to answer his call that she was attacked.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.766
Did you phone Margot
before or after you phoned your boss?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.602
Tony, I know what I wanted to ask you.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.436
Why did you...

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:41.645
telephone me last night?

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:45.190
Now, just one moment,
before I lose the thread of this.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:49.153
Now, at three minutes past 11,
you left your party to phone your boss.

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:50.904
Yes, I used the pay phone in the lobby.

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:54.533
How long were you on the telephone to your boss
before you called your wife?

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.953
In fact, I never did speak to him.
I couldn't remember his number...

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.123
so I rang my wife to ask her
to look it up in the address book.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.709
You mean you hauled me out of bed
just to get his number?

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:04.877
I had to, darling.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:06.795
My boss is flying to Brussels this morning.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.673
I wanted to remind him of something.
It was rather important.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.967
Wasn't there a telephone directory in the hotel?

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.386
Yes, but his country number
wouldn't be in that directory.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.722
Mm. And did you phone him?

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:20.184
Oh, no. Naturally when I heard what
had happened here, I forgot all about it.

01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:23.187
Mm. Yes.

01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:25.981
Mr. Halliday, Mr. and Mrs. Wendice
are coming to my office...

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.566
to make their statements.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:30.694
Would you give me your address, sir?
I may want to get in touch with you.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:32.655
- Why, certainly.
- I'll get my coat.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.281
I'm staying at Carfax Hotel.

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:37.159
Just write it down there, will you?
Your telephone number as well.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.786
All right.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.962
Ever been over here before, sir?

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.675
- Uh, yes. Yes, about a year ago.
- Mm.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.219
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.012
Uh, Mr. Wendice.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.931
There's quite a crowd
in front of the house.

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:01.266
I was going to suggest
that we left by the garden.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.227
- Isn't there's a gate at the far end?
- Yes.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:06.271
I'm afraid the gate may be locked.
Would you mind taking a look, sir?

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.981
Certainly.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.949
How much does he know
about you and Mrs. Wendice?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.868
I beg your pardon?

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:22.413
You wrote a letter to Mrs. Wendice
from New York.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.499
It was found in the dead man's
inside pocket.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:29.420
I didn't mention it because
I wasn't sure how much Mr. Wendice knew.

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:31.547
Have you any idea how it got there?

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:32.923
No.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.636
- Where's Tony?
- He's just gone into the garden.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.264
Mrs. Wendice, when you lost your handbag...

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.224
did you lose a letter as well?

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:44.017
No.

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:47.312
Margot, it was found
in the dead man's pocket.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.815
You did lose it, didn't you?

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:52.609
Yes, I did.

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.528
I asked you that before, didn't I?

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:58.240
Yes, but you see,
my husband didn't know about it.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.451
This man was blackmailing you,
wasn't he?

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:01.368
It's no good.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:02.661
- Tony will have to know.
- No.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.329
It's the only thing we can do. Inspector...

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:08.709
after Mrs. Wendice lost my letter,
she received these two notes.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.674
Last October.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.801
How many times have you seen this man?

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:20.345
I've never seen him.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.848
- I'd like you to come along with us.
- Yes, of course.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.393
Mrs. Wendice, when you come
to make your statement...

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.895
there may be other police officers present.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.356
I shall warn you first
that anything you say...

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.901
will be taken down
and may be used in evidence.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.278
Now, never mind
what you've told me so far.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.654
We'll forget all about that.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:42.201
But from now on, tell us exactly
what you know about this man...

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.286
and exactly what happened last night.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:45.953
If you try and conceal...

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.080
anything at all...

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.625
it may put you
in a very serious position.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.002
I wish you'd explain
what you mean by all this.

01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:56.340
I will. Now, you admit
that you killed this man.

01:08:56.508 --> 01:08:58.466
Well, you say you did it in self-defense.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.011
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses...

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.305
so we've only your word for that.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:06.975
But I heard it all, inspector,
over the telephone.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.102
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.939
Well, I heard a series of faint cries.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:15.359
Well, did you hear anything to indicate
that a struggle was going on?

01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:19.321
What I did hear, inspector,
is perfectly consistent with what my wife told me.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:23.826
So all you really know of the matter
is what your wife told you, isn't it?

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.496
Now, you suggest that this man
came to burgle your flat...

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.081
but there's no evidence of that.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.959
There is evidence, however,
that he was blackmailing you.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.127
Blackmail?

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.629
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.798
And you suggest he came in
by the window.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.341
And we know that he came in
by that door.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.220
But he can't have come in that way.
That door was locked.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:44.846
And there are only two keys.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.558
My husband had his with him
and mine was in my handbag. Here.

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:50.894
You could have let him in.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:53.229
Are you suggesting
she let him in herself?

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:56.191
That appears to be the only way
he could've entered.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.986
Don't you even believe I was attacked?

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:01.321
How do you think
I got these bruises on my throat?

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:04.616
You could have caused those bruises yourself.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.912
A silk stocking was found
outside the window.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.498
It had two knots tied in it.

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:13.709
Does that mean anything to you?

01:10:14.002 --> 01:10:16.336
I suppose it must have been
the stocking he used.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:20.632
We found the twin stocking
hidden underneath this blotting pad.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.427
Can you explain why your attacker
should do that?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:25.470
No.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:27.306
Those stockings were yours,
weren't they?

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:28.640
No.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:29.933
We know they were.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:34.521
One of the heels had been darned
with some silk that didn't quite match.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:37.149
We found a reel of that silk
in your mending basket.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.238
Tony, there was a pair of stockings here.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:51.330
I've heard of the police deliberately planting clues
to ensure a conviction.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.041
His men were here for hours last night.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.793
They could've taken those stockings
and done anything with them.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:57.711
Of course they did.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.713
Probably wiped his shoes
on the doormat as well.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:00.881
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:04.092
Oh, hello, Roger, thank heaven you're in.
Tony Wendice here.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.137
Uh, listen, we had a burglary last night
and Margot was attacked.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:08.722
<i>Margot? Was she hurt?</i>

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.600
No, she's all right, but the man was killed,
and the police are here.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:12.643
And don't laugh...

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.145
they're suggesting that Margot
killed him intentionally.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:17.064
I wouldn't say that
if I were you, sir.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:18.490
<i>Well, that's a good one.</i> 

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.150
Yes, it is funny, isn't it?

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:23.278
Now, Roger, could you come around at once,
Maida Vale Police Station?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.073
- <i>I'll be there right away.</i>
- Oh, thanks, old boy. Goodbye.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.951
It's all right, darling.
Roger's gonna meet us at the police station.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.786
Mr. Wendice, I should advise you--

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.789
Our lawyer will give us any advice we need,
thank you.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.043
Margot.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.921
- Here's your handbag.
- Thank you.

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.883
- You are coming?
- Oh, but of course, inspector.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:48.720
Yes. Yes, well, I just--
I mean, I just wondered.

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:09.324
<i>I charge you that on the 26th of September...</i>

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:12.995
<i>you did willfully murder
Charles Alexander Swann.</i>

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:16.665
<i>Do you wish to say anything
in answer to this charge?</i>

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:25.507
<i>And did you, at any time in your life,
meet this man, Swann?</i>

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.262
<i>You received a letter from Mr. Halliday.</i>

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.348
<i>This letter was found
in the dead man's pocket.</i>

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.268
<i>Now you say you did not know him?</i>

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.734
<i>Do you find the prisoner,
Margot Mary Wendice...</i>

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:47.279
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.990
<i>Guilty.</i>

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.663
<i>The sentence of this court...</i>

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:00.625
<i>is that you be taken to the place
from whence you came...</i>

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:04.421
<i>from thence to a place of lawful execution.</i>

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.849
- Oh, hello, Mark.
- Tony.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:13:59.726
I--

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:10.112
Have you, uh, gotten any news
from the Home Secretary?

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.038
Then it's tomorrow?

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:26.461
Tony, I take it you'd do anything
to save her life.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.589
- We've done everything.
- No, Tony, we haven't done everything.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.717
I've been trying to figure out something for weeks
in case it came to this.

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:36.263
- Now I really believe it's her only chance.
- Let's have it.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:40.517
Margot was convicted because nobody
believed her story.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.270
The prosecution made out
she was telling one lie after another...

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:44.646
and the jury believed him.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.607
But what did his case really amount to?
Just three things:

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.235
My letter, her stocking...

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:52.737
and the fact that because
no key was found on Swann...

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.991
- she must've let him in herself.
- Don't try and tell me--

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:59.119
Wait a minute, Tony. Now, hear me out.
This is where you come in.

01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:00.996
You go to the police and tell them...

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.414
some story...

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:05.333
anything that will convince them
Margot wasn't lying after all.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.211
The police aren't likely to believe
anything I might tell them.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.381
Tony, I've been writing
this stuff for years.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.884
I've figured out something
for you to tell them.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.636
Now, let's take those points one by one.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:21.766
Margot says she never let Swann in
through this door.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.810
Okay.

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.354
He must have opened it somehow.

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:30.567
Suppose you tell the police
that you left your key out here somewhere.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:34.112
Then Swann could have let himself in.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.240
- How'd he know it was there?
- You told him.

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.117
But I haven't met Swann in 20 years.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:44.414
Tony, Swann is dead.
Now, we've gotta make the most of that.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.041
You can tell any story about him now.

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.460
You can even say
that you two met somewhere...

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.837
and you planned this whole thing together.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.088
Planned what?

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.467
Are you suggesting I arranged for Swann
to come here...

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:56.718
to blackmail her?

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.261
No.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:00.472
To kill her.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.975
- Kill Margot?
- That's it.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:04.809
Why?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.770
Because she said so.

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:11.274
"He came from behind the curtain...

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:14.903
and he tried to strangle me."
Okay, that's what he did.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.988
All you gotta do is
support everything she said.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.823
Don't you see? That's my whole idea.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.450
What about your letter?

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:23.286
A man doesn't kill the person he's blackmailing.
Doesn't make sense.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:27.457
Yes, I know. That worried me for a while too,
but I've got that licked.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:28.333
You tell them...

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.544
that you stole her handbag yourself.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:32.671
Why should I do that?

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.841
Because you wanted to read my letter.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:39.719
When you had read it, you got mad
and decided to teach her a lesson.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.471
So you wrote those blackmail notes.

01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:43.056
Nobody can prove you didn't.

01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:46.309
You can also say you never saw Swann
at Victoria Station.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:49.271
You just invented that
to try to connect him with my letter.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.106
Don't you see how it all hangs together?

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.942
But your letter was found in his pocket.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.361
- Well, you put it there.
- When?

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.989
Sometime before the police arrived.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.660
And you could have also...

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.246
planted the stockings...

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.205
at the same time.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.541
But, Mark, why should I want anyone
to kill Margot?

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.710
I know, Tony.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:15.338
It's tough for us to see
because we both love her...

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:18.091
but we need a reason now.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.093
We need it badly.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.474
Let's take one of the old stock motives.
Had Margot made a will?

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:30.020
- Yes, I believe she had.
- Who was the beneficiary?

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:31.479
Why, I am, I suppose.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:32.731
There's your reason, Tony.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:35.275
Thousands of husbands and wives
leave money to each other...

01:17:35.443 --> 01:17:38.111
without murdering each other.
The police wouldn't believe it.

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:39.696
They'd take it for what it is:

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:42.365
A man trying desperately
to save his wife.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.868
Well, I certainly think
it's worth that try.

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:48.038
Let's face it. They can't hang you
for a murder that never came off.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:49.748
You'd get a few years in prison.

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.625
Thanks very much.

01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:55.253
It's a small price to pay.
You'd be saving her life.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.881
That's fine coming from you, Mark.

01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:00.884
Her life wouldn't be in danger at all
if it hadn't been for you.

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:05.638
It's because of her association with you
that she lost the sympathy of the jury.

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.434
Don't get me wrong, Mark.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.228
If there was the slightest chance
of this coming off, I'd do it...

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.898
but it's got to be convincing.

01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:18.234
For instance, how could I possibly have
persuaded Swann to do a thing like this?

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.111
Well, you offered him money...

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.113
- or something.
- Money? I don't have any.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:23.573
Yes, you'd have had Margot's.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.326
It'd be months before
I get my hands on that...

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:28.912
and people don't commit murder on credit.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:30.789
No, I'm....

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:34.125
I'm afraid you'll have to think
of something better than that.

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:36.878
I know you're trying to help...

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.964
but can you imagine anyone
believing a story like that?

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.134
Yes, I can, if you make them believe it.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.012
I wouldn't know what to say.
You'd have to come with me.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.514
Tony, that'd really be a mistake.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.809
They know the kind of stuff I write.
We wouldn't stand a chance there--

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.444
Oh, hello, inspector.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.161
Is it about my wife?

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.748
- No, sir, I'm afraid not.
- Then what is it?

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:17.210
Well, I'm making inquiries
in connection with a robbery...

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:19.546
that took place
about three weeks ago, sir.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.673
Well, can't it wait a few days?

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.717
Of course, sir.
I'm very conscious of your position.

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:27.345
If I may, I'd like to say
how deeply sorry I am--

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.265
Yes, inspector, yes, all right.
Now, how can I help you?

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:32.851
The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street...

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.310
was attacked in his office...

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.980
and two men made off
with several hundred pounds...

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:38.731
mostly in pound notes.

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:40.316
What is all this to do with me?

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.528
Well, in cases like this,
all police divisions are asked to keep a lookout...

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.905
for anyone spending large sums of money.

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.073
I see.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:52.036
And I was wondering
if you'd sold anything recently for cash.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:52.871
Why?

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:57.876
Well, my sergeant happened to be making inquiries
at Wales' Garage the other day...

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:02.005
and it appears that
you settled an account there recently...

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.632
for just over £60.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.968
Yes, I happened to have
quite a bit on me at the time...

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:08.428
so I settled for cash.

01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:09.804
I see.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.056
Had you just drawn this money
from your bank?

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.601
Have you been to my bank, inspector?

01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:18.771
Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, yeah.
Yeah, but they wouldn't help me.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.399
Oh, bank statements are always jealously guarded.

01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:24.527
Yes, but I'm rather surprised
you didn't come to me first.

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:29.073
It was only a routine matter after all.
I didn't want to disturb you.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:32.702
Where did you get it, sir?

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.662
Is that any of your business?

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.749
Well, if it was stolen money,
yes, sir, it is my business.

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.293
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.

01:20:40.628 --> 01:20:42.962
Do you really think
I've been receiving stolen money?

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:45.131
Well, until you tell me
where you got it...

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.550
I shan't know what to think, shall I?
You see...

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:49.969
if you got this money
from someone you didn't know...

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.556
I mean, that might be
the very person we're looking for.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:55.225
Hello.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.937
- Is this yours, sir?
- What is it?

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.188
Somebody's latchkey.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.148
It was lying on the floor just here.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.654
No. Mine's here.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:16.538
No. No, it's not yours.
It may be mine then.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.670
Yes. Yes, it is mine. 
Yes, it must have dropped out of the pocket.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.588
There's a small hole there.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:29.342
That's the trouble with these latchkeys,
they're all alike.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:30.635
I'm sorry, you were saying?

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.721
- I don't think I was, was I?
- Oh, yes, about that money.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.015
I'd be grateful if you'd tell me
where you got it.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:38.935
After all, £100 is quite a lot
to carry around.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:42.689
- You said 60 a moment ago.
- Did I? Oh, yes.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:47.277
Yes, my sergeant decided to dig a little deeper
before he put in his report.

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:50.238
He said that you also paid a bill
at your tailor's...

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.115
and another for wines and spirits.

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:53.992
I'm sorry he went to all that trouble.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.035
Had he come to me,
I could've explained at once.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:59.247
I simply won rather a large sum
at dog racing.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:00.373
Over £100?

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:03.418
Yes, over £100.
It has been done before, you know.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.421
Yes, well, why didn't you
tell me this straightaway then?

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:09.173
Well, I was rather ashamed
of being caught going to dog racing...

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.593
when my wife is under sentence of death.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.972
Yes, I know how it is.
It helps to take your mind off things.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.099
Well, that answers everything, doesn't it?

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.018
I'm sorry to have to bother you
at this time.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.144
Not at all, inspector.

01:22:21.312 --> 01:22:22.687
Not at all.

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.403
Uh, there's just one other thing, sir.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.531
Have you a small, blue attaché case?

01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:35.992
- Don't say you found it already.
- Why, have you lost it?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.703
Yes. I was going to report it
this afternoon. I think...

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.622
- I left it in a taxi.
- I see.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.751
Well, we-- We must try and get it back,
mustn't we?

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:46.336
Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.838
Uh, Hyde Park Corner
about half an hour ago.

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:49.714
Anything valuable?

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.050
- No, a few books and, uh--
- Any money?

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.135
Two or £3 in an envelope, I believe.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.303
Not 2- or 300?

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.971
No, I'm afraid not.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:58.348
Just as well.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:01.392
Inspector, how did you find out
about the attaché case?

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.187
The wine shop mentioned you had it
when you paid your bill.

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:06.856
So my sergeant checked back
on your garage and your tailor.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.442
They both remembered you having it
when you paid them.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:12.445
- Yes, I use it instead of a briefcase.
- Mm. Well...

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:15.073
these taxi men are pretty good
at turning things in.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.033
I hope you'll find it all right, sir.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.745
Inspector, before you go...

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:25.958
I think Mr. Wendice
has something to tell you.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:27.460
Has he?

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:31.005
Then I'd like to show you
something in here, sir.

01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:44.227
No wonder you couldn't bear
to sleep in her bedroom.

01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:47.021
There must be over £500 here.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.441
Where did you get it?

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:53.486
Well, I can tell you why he got it.

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.863
This money was to have been paid
to a man named Swann...

01:23:56.031 --> 01:24:00.118
after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.
But as you know, there was an accident...

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.704
so it wasn't necessary
to pay Swann after all.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.707
Obviously, he couldn't produce all this
without questions being asked...

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.333
so he lived on it.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:10.378
He's been living on it
since the 27th of March.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.046
Well, Mr. Wendice?

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.924
Before you came, inspector,
he was trying to persuade me...

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:19.178
to go to the police
with the most fantastic story you ever heard.

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:22.849
Apparently, I bribed Swann
to murder my wife so that....

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:24.934
Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:27.437
So that I could inherit all her money.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:31.649
And that isn't all.
You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.777
Well, apparently, Swann didn't steal it, I did...

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:37.029
and I wrote those two blackmail notes...

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:41.033
and I kept Mr. Halliday's letter
and planted it on the body.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:43.953
- And the stocking--
- Oh, yes, the stocking.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:46.914
Perhaps I'd better tell this, Mark.
Might sound more like a confession.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.917
I substituted.... Is that the right word?

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:53.755
Yes. I substituted my wife's other stocking
for the one that.... Uh--

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.047
You do follow me, don't you?

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.716
What else, Mark?

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:58.926
He told Swann...

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.262
he'd hide his key somewhere out here...

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.723
probably up on this ledge.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.933
Swann let himself in.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:09.395
He hid behind the curtains.
Then Wendice phoned from the hotel.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.980
- That brought her--
- Just one moment.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.899
If Swann had used Mr. Wendice's key...

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.067
it would still have been on him
when he died.

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:18.738
Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in
when he returned from the hotel?

01:25:18.906 --> 01:25:20.364
Well, she could have let him in.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.409
He could've taken his key from Swann's pocket
before the police got here.

01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:27.246
But he let himself in with his own key.
That came out in the trial.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:28.164
Don't you remember?

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:31.125
Come on, Mark. Your move.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:34.796
Uh....

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:40.343
Swann could have taken the key
down from here, unlocked the door...

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:42.970
and then replaced the key on the ledge
before he came in.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.097
All right. This is very interesting...

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:48.059
but it isn't getting me any nearer
what I came to find out.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.770
But this is a question of life and death.
What else matters?

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.397
What matters to me is
where Mr. Wendice got this money.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:54.941
That's all I want to know.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.992
Just a moment, please, sir.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.792
Inspector, wait a minute. Look at this.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.253
The last check he wrote
was on the 26th of March...

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:18.339
the day before this all happened.
He's been living off it ever since.

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.634
- There's his bank--
- Mr. Halliday.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.219
Sorry.

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:30.059
He hasn't drawn any large sums from his bank.
Nothing over £53.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:35.815
But look, inspector, practically every week.

01:26:35.983 --> 01:26:37.441
Thirty-five pounds, 40...

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.151
£45, 50.

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:40.486
He could've saved it up.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.780
Of course I could've been
planning all this for years.

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:44.323
Then where did you get it?

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:47.994
Do you really want to know?
I warn you, you won't like it, Mark.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.036
Come on.

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:52.164
All right, you asked for it.

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:54.333
When she called me back
from the party that night...

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:58.254
I found her kneeling beside Swann's body,
going through his pockets.

01:26:58.422 --> 01:27:02.091
She kept saying he had something of hers,
but she couldn't find it.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:05.720
She was almost hysterical.
That's why I wouldn't let the police question her.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:09.432
In the state she was in,
she would have told every lie under the sun.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.686
The next morning she showed me the money
just as it is now, all in £1 notes.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:18.232
And she said, "If anything happens to me,
don't let them find this."

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:22.278
Well, after she was arrested,
I took the money in that case...

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.364
to Charing Cross Station
and left it in the checkroom.

01:27:25.532 --> 01:27:29.827
Whenever I needed money, I took it out
and left it in some other checkroom.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.372
I knew if you had found it,
she wouldn't stand a chance.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:37.668
You see, she was just about to give it to him
when she killed him instead.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.963
You don't expect anyone
to believe this, do you?

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:44.050
I have really no idea.
What about it, inspector?

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.177
Hm?

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:48.846
Well, I must say I suspected something like that.

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.474
You're not even gonna check on this?

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:52.808
She's being hanged tomorrow.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:55.144
Look, all this has been
out of my hands for months.

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:56.979
There's been a trial and an appeal--

01:27:57.147 --> 01:27:59.315
Oh, of course it wouldn't mean much to you.

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:01.567
You'd have to admit
you arrested the wrong person.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:04.820
I think you'd better go.

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:06.906
You bet I'll go.

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.619
But you've made one mistake.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:13.537
What'll happen when Margot
hears about this?

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:16.832
- She'll deny it, of course.
- And perhaps she'll change her will.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.377
You'll have done it all for nothing, Tony.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:27.093
If I'd told that story of his,
would anyone have believed me?

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.553
No, not a chance.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:33.808
Before nearly every execution,
someone comes forward like this.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:37.228
This must have been very distressing for you,
coming as it did.

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:40.815
You suppose they'd let him see her?
I don't want her upset just now.

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:44.193
Have a word with your lawyer.
He might be able to prevent it.

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:47.154
I should get all that money into the bank
before somebody pinches it.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.073
Thank you. I think I will.

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:53.577
I hope Mr. Halliday's not waiting outside
to see me.

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:56.664
Would you mind just taking a look, sir,
to make sure he's gone?

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:08.009
All clear.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.928
Good. Oh, by the way, sir,
I was asked to tell you.

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:14.306
There are a few things belonging to Mrs. Wendice
at the police station.

01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:15.307
What sort of things?

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.019
Oh, just some books and a handbag,
I believe.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.187
They'd like you to come
and collect them sometime.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.399
- You mean after tomorrow?
- Yes, or today, if you like.

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:25.735
Just ask the desk sergeant.
He knows all about it.

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:27.528
- Yes.
- Well, goodbye, Mr. Wendice.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.989
I don't suppose we shall meet again.

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.616
Goodbye, inspector, and thank you very much.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.017
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>

01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:25.104
Chief inspector here.
Give me Sergeant O'Brien, quick.

01:31:25.272 --> 01:31:26.105
<i>O'Brien here.</i>

01:31:26.273 --> 01:31:28.858
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
I've got back in again.

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:30.526
Start the ball rolling.

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:31.819
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:47.001
Inspector Hubbard, it's me,
Mark Halliday.

01:31:49.296 --> 01:31:51.130
Now, what are you up to?
What's the idea?

01:31:51.298 --> 01:31:53.132
- What are you doing here?
- Never mind that.

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.092
- I wondered why--
- Get out of here, quick.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.260
- Listen--
- Shut up.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:58.846
You want to save Mrs. Wendice?
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.

01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.515
How are you possibly gonna--?

01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:30.062
Look, what is all this?

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.106
They talk about flat-footed policemen.

01:33:32.274 --> 01:33:35.901
May the saints protect us
from the gifted amateur.

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.790
You'd better prepare yourself
for a surprise, Mr. Halliday.

01:33:58.174 --> 01:33:59.758
Margot.

01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:03.595
Hello, Mark.

01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:06.098
Where's Tony?

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:09.810
He-- He's gone out.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:11.186
When will he be back?

01:34:11.354 --> 01:34:13.105
We're not sure.

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:15.149
Was that you who rang just now?

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:18.736
Yes. Why didn't you let me in?

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.863
You've got a key.
Why didn't you use it?

01:34:21.031 --> 01:34:25.367
- I did, but it didn't fit the lock.
- No. And you know why, don't you?

01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:28.579
No, I don't.
Has the lock been changed?

01:34:28.747 --> 01:34:30.748
May I have your bag a moment?

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:38.589
Whose key is this?

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:42.801
I thought it was mine.
I don't know.

01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:50.434
What's going on here?

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:57.983
Your husband's explained this, you know.

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:00.736
You can tell us all about it now.

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:04.031
What is it? I don't understand.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:07.993
No, I don't believe you do.

01:35:11.498 --> 01:35:13.415
- Pearson?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.460
Take this handbag
back to the police station...

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:18.003
and get that car out of the way.

01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:20.422
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, you clod.

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:24.176
You can't walk down the street like that.
You'll be arrested.

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:26.095
Well, here. Put it in this.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.597
Margot, how did you get here?

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:30.724
I don't know.

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:35.062
About an hour ago,
the warden came to see me...

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:37.606
and just said I was to be taken home.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:40.609
And then two detectives brought me here.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:46.031
They said I could go,
but I couldn't get that door open.

01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:50.452
Where's Tony?
He was supposed to visit me this morning...

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.704
and they said he couldn't come.

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:55.165
Has anything happened to him?

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:57.876
No. Nothing.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:35:59.711
Inspector, I don't wanna interfere...

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:02.381
but do you think you could tell us
what you're up to?

01:36:02.549 --> 01:36:06.552
Mrs. Wendice, what I'm about to tell you
may come as a shock.

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:08.345
Yes?

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:12.808
We strongly suspect that your husband
had planned to murder you.

01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:16.687
Tony arranged for Swann
to come here that night and kill you.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.649
How long have you known this?

01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:22.234
Did you suspect it yourself?

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:25.737
No, never. And yet....

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.951
What's the matter with me, Mark?

01:36:32.579 --> 01:36:35.247
I don't seem able to feel anything.

01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:39.251
Shouldn't I break down or something?

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:41.587
It's delayed action, that's all.

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:45.632
In a couple of days, you're gonna have
the most wonderful breakdown.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.842
When did you find out, sir?

01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:50.971
Well, the first clue
came quite by accident.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.764
We discovered that your husband...

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.268
had been spending a large number of pound notes
all over the place.

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:58.270
It ran into over £300.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.648
And it appeared to have started
at about the time you were arrested.

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:05.986
Now, I had to find out
where he got that money and how.

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:07.321
And then I remembered...

01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:10.240
that after you were arrested,
we searched this flat.

01:37:10.408 --> 01:37:13.702
And I saw a copy of his bank statement
in that desk.

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:17.581
So yesterday afternoon, I went to the prison
and asked to see your handbag.

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:21.336
While I was doing this,
I managed to lift your latchkey. 

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:25.672
Highly irregular, of course,
but my blood was up.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.217
And then this morning
when your husband was out...

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:30.844
I came back here
to look at his statement.

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:33.597
I never saw it,
because I never got through that door.

01:37:33.765 --> 01:37:38.018
You see, the key that I'd taken
from your handbag...

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:39.686
didn't fit the lock.

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:47.569
Williams?

01:37:48.138 --> 01:37:48.987
Wendice. 

01:38:29.011 --> 01:38:30.737
Oh, that was a near one.

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:44.251
<i>Maida Vale Police. O'Brien speaking.</i>

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:47.170
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
he's found out about his raincoat.

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:51.341
He just came back and couldn't get in.
I think he's on his way to the station now.

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.719
- Has Pearson arrived with the handbag?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:57.764
Good. Now, listen.
Give Wendice those books and the handbag...

01:38:57.932 --> 01:39:00.017
and make sure he sees the key.

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:03.437
Better make him check the contents
and sign for them.

01:39:03.605 --> 01:39:07.649
If he wants his own key and raincoat,
tell him I've gone to Glasgow.

01:39:07.817 --> 01:39:08.734
<i>Right, sir.</i>

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.277
- Any questions?
- <i>No.</i>

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:13.530
- Right. Call me back when he leaves.
- <i>Right, sir.</i>

01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:18.660
Well, Mr. Halliday, have you got it?

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:20.120
I don't think so.

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:22.331
Where's Mrs. Wendice's key?

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:30.964
It took me just half an hour to find it.

01:39:35.178 --> 01:39:38.388
But if it was there,
why didn't Wendice use it just now?

01:39:38.556 --> 01:39:40.682
Didn't use it because
he doesn't realize it's there.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:45.187
He still thinks it's in his wife's handbag.
You see, you were very nearly right.

01:39:45.355 --> 01:39:47.564
He told Swann that he would leave your latchkey...

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.566
under the stair carpet, Mrs. Wendice...

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:53.445
and told him to return it
to the same place when he left.

01:39:53.613 --> 01:39:55.781
But as Swann was killed,
we naturally assumed...

01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:58.050
that your key would still be
in one of Swann's pockets. 

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:00.827
That was his little mistake...

01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:04.414
because Swann had done
exactly as you suggested, Mr. Halliday.

01:40:04.582 --> 01:40:06.792
He unlocked the door...

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:10.629
then returned the key
before he came in.

01:40:10.797 --> 01:40:12.714
And it's been out there ever since.

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:16.134
And the key Wendice took out
of Swann's pocket...

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:17.719
and returned to her handbag was--

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:20.305
Swann's own latchkey.

01:40:23.059 --> 01:40:26.395
Mind you, even I didn't guess that at once.
Extraordinary.

01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:30.482
You know, it had always puzzled me
that no key was found on Swann's body.

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:33.402
After all, most men
carry a latchkey about with them.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.904
And then I had a brainwave.

01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:38.657
I took the key that was in your handbag...

01:40:38.825 --> 01:40:43.078
to his girlfriend's, Mrs. Van Dorn's,
and unlocked the door of her flat...

01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:47.165
and then I borrowed her telephone
and called Scotland Yard.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.334
Why did you bring me here?

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:51.128
Because you were the only other person...

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:53.505
who could possibly have left
that key outside.

01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:56.133
I had to find out
if you knew it was there.

01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:59.302
Suppose I had known?

01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:03.181
You didn't.

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:09.104
- Mark.
- Yes, darling?

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:12.315
I think I'm going to have that breakdown.

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:19.197
- <i>Inspector Hubbard?</i>
- O'Brien?

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:22.242
- <i>Yes. He's just left the station.</i>
- Right.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.917
Try and hang on just a little longer.

01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:37.883
Williams, he's just left the station.
Give me a thump if he comes this way.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:41.136
- Can I have a handkerchief?
- What happens now?

01:41:41.304 --> 01:41:43.430
Sooner or later, he'll come back here.

01:41:43.598 --> 01:41:46.600
As I've pinched his latchkey,
he'll try the one in the handbag.

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:49.269
When that doesn't fit,
he'll realize his mistake...

01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:52.105
put two and two together,
and look under the stair carpet.

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:55.525
But if he doesn't do that, all this
is pure guesswork. We can't prove a thing.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:59.070
That's perfectly true,
but once he opens that door...

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:01.573
- we shall know everything.
- What will you do then?

01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:04.910
I'm to phone the Home Secretary personally.
He's standing by for a call now.

01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:08.747
- And Mrs. Wendice?
- Will have nothing else to fear.

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:13.376
All right, Margot?

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.045
Yes, I'm all right.

01:42:15.213 --> 01:42:17.130
Quiet now, you two.

01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:53.750
What's he doing? 

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:55.961
He's wondering why that key doesn't fit.

01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:59.422
He's going around to the back entrance.
He's stopped again.

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.216
He's looking at the handbag now.

01:43:01.968 --> 01:43:06.054
He's trying to remember
when he put the key back in there.

01:43:08.933 --> 01:43:09.891
Now he's given up.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:13.979
I'm afraid we've had it this time.
He's going way down the street.

01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:14.813
Hold it.

01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:19.109
He's stopped again. He's turning round.

01:43:19.944 --> 01:43:21.570
He's staring at the key.

01:43:23.406 --> 01:43:26.366
Of course. That's Swann's key, isn't it?

01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:28.034
Now he's got it.

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:30.203
He's coming back fast.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.207
He's remembered.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:32.641
As you said, Mark, it, uh,
might work out on paper but, uh--

01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:34.976
Congratulations, Inspector.

01:44:35.144 --> 01:44:36.811
Oh, by the way....

01:44:45.196 --> 01:44:46.363
Oh, how about you, Margot?

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.367
Yes, I could do with something.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.452
- Mark?
- So could I.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.454
I suppose you're still on duty, inspector.
