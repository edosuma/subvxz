00:02.085 --> 00:03.917
<i>Rick:
I remember.</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.086
(birds chirping)

00:33.867 --> 00:35.699
(walkers growling)

00:55.639 --> 00:57.221
(Gracie coos)

01:26.920 --> 01:30.288
Saw she was up,
so...

01:41.852 --> 01:44.093
How'd it happen?

01:48.442 --> 01:51.685
(sighs)

01:51.778 --> 01:53.860
Please tell me.

01:57.034 --> 02:00.402
(walkers growling)

02:02.706 --> 02:05.698
Siddiq:
My mother's dead.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.705
She was bit.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.040
I had to watch her die.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.341
Not long ago.

02:18.555 --> 02:23.391
And she believed people,
their-- their souls...

02:23.477 --> 02:27.562
were trapped in the bodies
of the monsters...

02:27.648 --> 02:30.731
that killing the dead

02:30.817 --> 02:33.809
lets the living move on
into an afterlife.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.526
Carl was taking me back
to your community,

02:41.620 --> 02:44.658
and I told him
what my mother believed.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.076
And we saw
a few of the dead.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.334
(exhales sharply)
He wanted to honor her.

02:54.424 --> 02:59.464
I think he was trying to show me
that I could trust him.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.475
That's how it happened.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.188
(voice breaking)
He died paying respects

03:11.274 --> 03:13.857
to a woman he never knew.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.354
I don't believe
what my mother believed.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.691
I'm a doctor.
Well, resident.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.116
I don't know
if we have souls.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.877
But I was out there
a long time.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.373
And in the end,
all I had left

03:37.467 --> 03:39.879
was what my mother
had given me.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.091
This idea...

03:44.766 --> 03:48.725
of a--
of a kind of goodness

03:48.812 --> 03:53.431
to frame my life with,
and it did keep me going,

03:53.525 --> 03:56.813
whether it was true
or I was--

03:56.903 --> 03:59.065
I was just doing it
for my mother.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.738
But it was dangerous.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.908
It was dangerous,
and I didn't think about that.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.835
I should've.

04:20.719 --> 04:25.088
But all that's left
of the people we lose,

04:25.182 --> 04:29.050
what was theirs...

04:29.144 --> 04:31.431
are their ideas.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.945
Thank you.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.318
We're gonna beat 'em today.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.868
We are.

04:48.955 --> 04:53.540
And when we do, will you come
back to the Kingdom?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.790
I won't run away again.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.621
Maybe.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.799
<i>How you dam', boss'?</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:06.799
If this morning
is to be our last,

05:06.890 --> 05:09.473
it will be a fine morning,
indeed.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.470
This isn't the last
of shit.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.802
It could be
for some of our ranks.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.309
I accept that.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.810
I'm not accepting shit.

05:17.901 --> 05:22.520
It's not simple acceptance
or pessimism, no.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.151
Not that.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.155
But to justify everything
we've lost,

05:28.245 --> 05:30.862
we must risk
losing everything.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.117
We're not losing shit--

05:32.207 --> 05:33.743
Jeri')!-

05:40.215 --> 05:41.546
Daryl: All right.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.000
We'll stick to this road,
keep to the trees,

05:44.094 --> 05:45.505
we'll get there quicker.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.211
Plus, we can keep an eye
on the road that way.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.342
Yeah, if they're planning
anything, we'll see it.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.843
You think
you can trust Gregory?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.550
What he told us?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.851
I locked him up
inside the house.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.849
He knew I wouldn't
let him walk around free.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.227
He knew he was
coming back to that.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.183
He doesn't believe
in anything except himself,

06:01.278 --> 06:03.235
and he'd have to believe
in the Saviors a whole lot

06:03.321 --> 06:04.561
to send us into a trap

06:04.656 --> 06:05.737
and think it would
work out for him.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.735
Unless Dwight didn't tell him.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.442
That asshole could
be setting us up.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.073
(paper rustles)

06:19.129 --> 06:22.042
(suspenseful music plays)

06:28.263 --> 06:30.174
Morgan.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.505
Morgan, what is it?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.591
They're gone.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.222
They're doing something.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.270
(gate opens)

06:48.992 --> 06:52.075
(Henry grunts)

06:52.162 --> 06:54.073
(breathing heavily)

07:06.551 --> 07:09.839
They were, uh...

07:11.848 --> 07:14.931
They were gone-- him.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.929
They were coming in.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.682
I asked Maggie if we could clear
the walkers from the wall.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.559
We... drew them away
so we wouldn't

07:21.650 --> 07:24.312
have to worry about 'em
when we rolled out.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.984
He did.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.446
Let's keep gettin' ready,
everyone.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.278
First team's going in 20.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.365
He said when we roll out.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.247
You and your people
aren't coming.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.920
You can be here.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.668
But you're not us.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.501
As long as we got
that straight.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.926
Maybe you shouldn't
come with us.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.757
I have to.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.142
(sighs)
You've done plenty.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.219
I have to.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.350
- Morgan--
- Rick.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.194
I have to.
I have t-to...

08:09.280 --> 08:10.645
(gate creaks)

08:10.740 --> 08:13.072
- It's not me.
- (gate closes)

08:13.159 --> 08:16.322
It's everybody else,
and I'm gonna keep 'em alive.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.122
I'm gonna keep Henry
from... f--

08:24.087 --> 08:25.873
We...

08:28.174 --> 08:32.168
We are worse than we were...
me and you.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.969
We are.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.636
Giving your word to those men
back at the bar.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.344
I mean, it's what it took,
yeah, but...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.683
But that was
something else.

08:47.777 --> 08:51.020
That was something
wrong for you.

08:51.114 --> 08:55.824
And we crossed into it
because-- because...

08:57.829 --> 09:02.369
we've both lost everything,
everything good.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.450
What--

09:05.462 --> 09:08.375
What does it matter
if we spend whatever's left

09:08.465 --> 09:10.502
on keeping people alive?

09:10.592 --> 09:14.210
Because we haven't
lost everything.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.715
- Not yet.
- We have.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.217
And we can't go back.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.977
So let's just finish this.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.478
(insects chirping)

09:36.117 --> 09:38.358
(theme music playing)

10:25.208 --> 10:28.166
Negan:
<i>Look at</i> me Iookin' at you.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.743
<i>(chuckles)</i>

10:29.838 --> 10:31.829
<i>In case
it's not abundantly clear</i>

10:31.923 --> 10:35.132
<i>why I am grinning
from ear to ear,</i>

10:35.218 --> 10:37.630
<i>it's because
you magnificent creatures</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:41.759
<i>are about to usher in
a beautiful new day.</i>

10:41.850 --> 10:42.840
(clock ticking)

10:42.934 --> 10:47.644
Now, what Rick
and his mini pricks,

10:47.730 --> 10:50.893
dicks, and hicks
don't understand

10:50.984 --> 10:53.146
is that there are winners

10:53.236 --> 10:56.194
and there are losers.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.897
You lose, you die.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.823
You live, you win--

10:59.909 --> 11:02.367
you get the prize,
you get the shit.

11:02.453 --> 11:06.412
That shit
gets you more shit.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.079
We got Eugene from Ricky.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.875
He made us enough bullets

11:13.965 --> 11:19.335
to blast their asses
into the stratosphere.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.636
We live...

11:21.723 --> 11:23.384
they'll die.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.557
<i>Negan: See, what Ricky
doesn't understand,</i>

11:26.644 --> 11:29.853
<i>he thinks
that everybody wins,</i>

11:29.939 --> 11:33.227
<i>that everyone lives.</i>

11:33.318 --> 11:36.151
<i>That's cute.
(chuckles)</i>

11:36.237 --> 11:37.853
<i>That's a lie.</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:42.191
<i>We show people the truth
so they can be saved.</i>

11:42.285 --> 11:44.196
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:45.869
(bat thudding)

11:45.955 --> 11:47.571
(screaming)

11:49.375 --> 11:54.711
That... is who we are.

11:54.797 --> 11:59.132
We... are...

11:59.219 --> 12:00.459
Saviors.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.715
(cheering)

12:11.564 --> 12:13.646
(indistinct conversations)

12:27.789 --> 12:31.657
Negan:
Sucks, don't it, D?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.584
I mean, even with
that disgusting,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.753
knotted cheese
on the side of your face,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.797
you once had
these people's respect.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.000
But now?

12:42.095 --> 12:46.089
Well, now you don't
have a damn thing.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.014
Load him up.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.567
There's my bullet maker.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.657
AttachÃ© in tow

13:06.744 --> 13:08.826
and order fulfilled PDQ,
as promised.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.779
Every munition
personally quality-controlled

13:10.873 --> 13:12.989
by yours truly.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.916
Sleep be damned
and efforts be tripled,

13:15.003 --> 13:17.711
the deed is done.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.583
Take yourself a tester.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.882
(chuckles)

13:38.026 --> 13:39.733
Huh.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.066
Regina laid out
the plan for you, right?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.023
That's why I requested
the ride-along.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.279
Depending on the terrain
and timing,

13:48.369 --> 13:49.734
the pump and priming,

13:49.829 --> 13:52.491
I believe we should attempt
a one-fell-swooper.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.949
A firing line that would
minimize chaos opportunity

13:55.043 --> 13:58.502
and alpha-to-omega this thing
in less than 10.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.671
Are you sure that's something
you want to see?

14:01.758 --> 14:06.047
More of a "need to" thing.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.094
Look at you.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.432
Let's load up, roll out!

14:12.518 --> 14:16.102
Lance, Duke--
Boylan Road.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.556
Map will show you where I'll be
if there's trouble.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.765
No, we got this one
locked down, Jefe.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.897
Damn straight you do.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.064
Idiots.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.531
Why don't you tag along,
Gabey?

14:32.622 --> 14:34.238
It's a nice drive.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.745
I got some shit
that I want to confess.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.130
<i>Negan: Bless me, father,
for I have sinned-- probably.</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:49.677
<i>(chuckles)</i>

14:49.764 --> 14:51.721
<i>Any second now.</i>

14:51.808 --> 14:55.096
<i>Now, those men I sent out
down there on that road,</i>

14:55.186 --> 14:56.722
<i>setting up that road block
with the dead,</i>

14:56.813 --> 15:01.148
<i>not knowing they're joining
their cold asses any second,</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:04.568
<i>'cause Rick
and his band of pricks,</i>

15:04.654 --> 15:06.565
<i>they're gonna hit 'em hard.</i>

15:06.656 --> 15:09.614
(sighs)

15:09.700 --> 15:12.818
You know, I don't enjoy
sacrificing my own people.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.494
You know that, right?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.914
I mean, those guys back there,
they came up with Simon.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.786
Some of us had to take
one for the team,

15:19.877 --> 15:21.367
it may as well be them.

15:21.462 --> 15:25.126
(walker growling)

15:27.051 --> 15:29.292
(machine-gun fire)

15:35.852 --> 15:37.763
I still don't understand.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.811
Ricky was slipped
some intel,

15:39.897 --> 15:42.264
make him think he can get
the jump on me.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.476
The thing is, it came from
a less-than-reliable source,

15:45.570 --> 15:49.063
so if I were him,
I'd be scouting ahead.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.864
Taking out that
little road-block crew

15:50.950 --> 15:53.442
is gonna make Rick think
he's got the real story,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.402
where I'll really be.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.986
They'll come to get me.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.664
But, see, that is the trap.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.458
And that is how
we will get them.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.537
<i>Negan: They're gonna find a map
with the time and place I'll be,</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:07.167
<i>and they're gonna believe it.</i>

16:07.258 --> 16:09.875
<i>Because they will have killed
all those poor bastards.</i>

16:09.969 --> 16:11.459
Hey,hey,hey!
I give up!

16:11.554 --> 16:13.761
I give-- I'm done!

16:13.848 --> 16:15.885
I'm done!
Aah!

16:26.652 --> 16:28.893
Jared: Dude!
That was messed up.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.025
(chuckles)

16:31.115 --> 16:33.573
I mean, Jesus.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.320
Unh! Aah!

16:35.411 --> 16:39.655
(chuckles)

16:41.667 --> 16:43.078
You don't die, right?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.456
Man...

16:45.546 --> 16:47.583
You oughta try it sometime.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.463
Listen...

16:56.224 --> 16:58.465
You don't think you can
kill your way out of this,

16:58.559 --> 17:00.516
seeing everybody else go,
do you?

17:00.603 --> 17:02.469
Huh?

17:02.563 --> 17:05.396
'Cause let me tell you...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.520
not gonna happen.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.193
Uaughs)

17:10.279 --> 17:12.896
Jesus: Morgan?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.946
Are you with us?

17:18.287 --> 17:20.449
Ezekiel: Good people,
found something on our quarry.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.281
What is it?

17:23.376 --> 17:26.084
A list and another map.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.083
And what appear
to be other facts.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.291
They're lining up Saviors
on the Old Mill Road.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.716
That's where Negan will be.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.168
We have to get to Negan

17:35.263 --> 17:36.879
before they figure out
what happened here.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.054
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Maggie.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.302
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Maggie: I'm here.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.885
It's time.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.845
It was a trap.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.057
So we're changing the plan.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.390
So that's it?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.226
Your confession
is that you're...

17:51.320 --> 17:55.063
gonna kill
every last one of them?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.898
When you spoke before,
you seemed almost

17:56.993 --> 17:59.325
as if you didn't want
it to happen.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.663
It ain't about want,
Gabey.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.114
It never was.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.246
(walker growling)

18:07.336 --> 18:08.747
(tires screeching)

18:10.840 --> 18:12.422
No!

18:16.721 --> 18:18.678
(grunts)

18:20.975 --> 18:24.218
(tires screeching)

18:26.022 --> 18:28.013
Man:
Fell out the door!

18:28.107 --> 18:30.849
Hang back!
He can't see crap.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.741
(walker growling)

18:46.334 --> 18:49.747
(walker teeth snapping)

18:52.798 --> 18:54.038
(body thuds)

18:54.133 --> 18:55.919
Gabriel: Eugene,
I have to warn them.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.466
- You can't do this.
- Shut up. Shut your damn mouth,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.339
or so help me, I will use
a homemade munition

18:59.430 --> 19:01.387
to crack your cranium
right here, right now!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.465
Do you understand?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.470
Do you?!

19:09.148 --> 19:11.014
Yes.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.190
(breathing heavily)

19:13.277 --> 19:15.689
Look at you.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.147
Where does your faith go
when you truly need it?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.730
Hmm?

19:19.825 --> 19:23.489
Seems to me it's the only time
worth holding on to.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.320
(pats back)

19:25.414 --> 19:27.280
Sorry, Eugene.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.585
I'm gonna have to call dibs
on Gabey boy myself.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.207
Unh!

19:36.092 --> 19:40.177
You said you didn't want
to die a fruitless death.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.506
Well, you can't
always get what you want.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.770
Load him into the car.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.859
Jesus: You want to keep
these people safe,

20:04.954 --> 20:08.538
and you think you need to kill
other people to do that.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.367
That's not exactly safe for you,
which ultimately

20:12.461 --> 20:15.670
may not be safe for the people
you're trying to keep safe.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.339
It's a conundrum.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.339
Or it's not.

20:21.429 --> 20:25.013
But you can stop people
without killing them.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.807
I mean,
you almost stopped me.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.471
I have a simple proposal.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.476
Something to try.

20:37.153 --> 20:41.943
This end for the dead,
and this end for the living.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.273
And things will get better.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.954
Jesus.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.748
I'm starting to like that guy.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.585
Rosita: Oh, Jesus.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.634
Jerry: Holy damn.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.839
You ever seen one that big?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.593
No.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.472
Things are changing.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.724
Let's go.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.930
- How much further?
- We grow closer.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.108
Yonder, over the ridge.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.358
(vehicles approaching)

21:28.704 --> 21:33.323
(dramatic music plays)

21:33.417 --> 21:35.624
Saviors!

21:54.230 --> 21:59.691
(people whistling in distance)

22:08.994 --> 22:13.158
Negan on radio: (amplified)
Well, damn, <i>Rick,</i> look at <i>that.</i>

22:13.249 --> 22:16.037
<i>Pegged again.
Pegged so very hard.</i>

22:24.093 --> 22:26.380
(dramatic music plays)

22:26.470 --> 22:28.507
Negan on radio: (amplified)
<i>I</i> ambushed your ambush

22:28.597 --> 22:32.591
<i>with an even bigger ambush.</i>

22:32.685 --> 22:35.598
How about you step out
and face us?!

22:35.688 --> 22:38.680
<i>Oh, I am everywhere, Rick.</i>

22:38.774 --> 22:41.015
<i>Some more bullhorns,</i>

22:41.110 --> 22:42.942
more walkies.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.269
Pick a direction to run.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.946
See how you do.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.273
Make it fun for all of us.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.201
<i>Guess what else I did.</i>

22:52.288 --> 22:55.201
<i>I brought you
some of your old friends.</i>

22:57.293 --> 23:00.786
<i>You remember
your old buddy Eugene?</i>

23:00.880 --> 23:05.249
Well, he is the person
that made today possible.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.551
Same goes for Dwighty boy here.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.631
<i>In case you were wondering,
he didn't ream you on purpose.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:18.061
<i>No, he is just a-- a gutless
nothin' that sucks at life,</i>

23:18.147 --> 23:22.937
<i>and now he gets to stand
up here and watch you all die,</i>

23:23.027 --> 23:25.644
<i>and he's gonna live with that.</i>

23:25.738 --> 23:29.857
Gabriel, well...

23:29.950 --> 23:32.112
(gun cocks)
...he's got to go, too.

23:32.202 --> 23:36.742
We are cleaning house today,
Rick.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.745
And then... there's you.

23:39.835 --> 23:43.328
<i>It never had to be a fight.</i>

23:43.422 --> 23:46.084
<i>You just had to accept
how things are.</i>

23:46.175 --> 23:48.587
<i>So...</i>

23:48.677 --> 23:51.920
here we go.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.506
Congratulations, Rick.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.682
(walkie-talkie clicks)

24:05.778 --> 24:09.271
<i>Three!</i>

24:13.410 --> 24:14.821
<i>Two!</i>

24:25.297 --> 24:26.787
<i>One!</i>

24:26.882 --> 24:28.498

24:28.592 --> 24:31.710
(saviors screaming)

24:31.804 --> 24:34.887
(saviors shouting)

24:36.558 --> 24:42.144
(shouting continues in distance)

24:42.231 --> 24:44.063
NQW!

24:46.819 --> 24:52.155
(groaning)

24:52.241 --> 24:53.322
Eugene!

24:54.785 --> 24:56.526
(grunts)

24:59.123 --> 25:00.113
Aah!

25:04.086 --> 25:06.373
(screams)

25:08.424 --> 25:09.414
(gunshots)

25:09.508 --> 25:10.714
He's running!

25:10.801 --> 25:13.543
(machine-gun fire)

25:18.600 --> 25:20.511
(Gracie crying)

25:32.197 --> 25:33.779
ls Gregory
already out here?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.106
We left him
inside the house.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.361
Let them have him.
Shh!

25:36.452 --> 25:37.658
Keep going.
To the rendezvous point.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.985
The others
should already be there.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.911
- Hold up!
- What's going on?

25:40.998 --> 25:42.659
I'm gonna try
and slow them down.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.206
Go, go.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.751
What, just you?

25:46.837 --> 25:48.669
Look,
they can hear her.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.123
- They can hear her in New Jersey.
- I don't know about Jersey,

25:51.216 --> 25:52.798
but I'm not letting you
do this by yourself.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.341
You think I'm gonna
give you a gun?

25:54.428 --> 25:55.793
I'm gonna stay
one way or another.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.468
Any of you gents with me?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.639
'Cause I'm with her.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.969
Even if she's not
with us.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.397
(bag thuds)

26:08.484 --> 26:11.567
He did this!
Get him!

(gunshon

26:17.242 --> 26:20.155
(machine-gun fire in distance)

Morgan.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.749
Aah!

26:34.843 --> 26:39.508
Morgan,
you don't have to.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.713
Aah!

26:40.808 --> 26:43.721
(gunfire continues)

26:43.811 --> 26:45.893
Let's clean this up now,
shall we?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.481
Give it another second.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.369
(Saviors screaming)

27:11.380 --> 27:14.793
(glass shattering, explosions)

27:34.570 --> 27:36.686
Don't shoot.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.145
Please.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.481
(breathing heavily)

27:40.576 --> 27:43.034
We're done.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.031
It's over.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.714
Aah!

Just so you know,

28:48.685 --> 28:50.767
eenie meenie miney moe,

28:50.854 --> 28:53.892
that was bullshit.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.519
I made a choice.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.853
I just didn't want to kill
a kid's dad in front of him.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.440
Turns out that would've been
the best thing I could've done.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.901
Had I done it,
that kid might still be alive.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.861
<i>'</i> (grunts)
- Aah!

29:08.956 --> 29:11.869

You're beat.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.205
Your people are down.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.006
(groans)

29:21.093 --> 29:23.004
I'll get out of it.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.006
I always do.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.634
(both breathing heavily)

29:27.724 --> 29:31.012
It's just you and me,
Rick.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.892
And you--
you are torn open.

29:34.982 --> 29:40.819
I am bigger, I am badder,
and I got a bat.

29:40.904 --> 29:44.272
We can have a future.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.983
I know I will.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.034
Just give me--
give me 10 seconds

29:49.121 --> 29:51.829
so I can--
I can tell you how.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.497
No.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.291
Just give me 10 seconds
for Carl.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.923
Ten...

30:06.013 --> 30:07.674
nine...

30:07.764 --> 30:09.471
Carl said it doesn't
have to be--

30:09.558 --> 30:11.299
it doesn't have
to be a fight anymore.

30:11.393 --> 30:13.851
He was wrong.
Eight...

30:13.937 --> 30:17.146
No, no.
He was right.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.329
(grunts)

30:41.006 --> 30:44.340
(weakly)
Look what you did.

30:44.426 --> 30:49.512
Carl didn't know
a damn thing...

30:52.768 --> 30:54.679
(body thuds)

31:28.845 --> 31:31.212
(glass thuds)

31:53.662 --> 31:54.993
Save him.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.749
Mag _No!
Qle! Maggie!

32:00.836 --> 32:02.452
No, he can't!

32:02.546 --> 32:04.378
No!

32:04.464 --> 32:06.580
No, he killed Glenn!

32:06.675 --> 32:08.086
We have to.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.838
We have to end it!

32:10.929 --> 32:12.465
Rick!

32:14.141 --> 32:16.052
We have
to make it right!

32:16.143 --> 32:19.056
We can't make it right,
but this makes it over.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.262
- It's over.
- No!

32:21.356 --> 32:23.267
It's not over!

32:23.358 --> 32:26.271
It's not over
until he's dead!

32:26.361 --> 32:29.353
It's not over
till he's dead!

32:29.448 --> 32:32.816
(crying) No!

32:32.909 --> 32:34.195
No!

32:34.286 --> 32:39.781
No.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.209
(crying)

32:43.295 --> 32:46.083
What happened,
what we did...

32:46.173 --> 32:48.335
what we lost...

32:48.425 --> 32:50.462
there's gotta
be something after.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.882
The ones who have 'em up,
put your hands down.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.895
We're all gonna go home now.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.772
Negan's alive.

33:08.862 --> 33:12.105
But his way
of doing things is over.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.482
And anyone who can't
live with that

33:15.577 --> 33:20.037
will pay the price,
I promise you that.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.330
And any person here

33:22.417 --> 33:27.503
who would live
in peace and fairness...

33:27.589 --> 33:30.923
who would find common ground...

33:33.970 --> 33:37.554
this world is yours, by right.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.722
We are life.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.924
That's death!

33:41.019 --> 33:42.680
And it's coming for us.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.730
Unless we stand together!

33:46.816 --> 33:50.184
So go home.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.270
Then the work begins.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.824
The new world begins.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.955
All this...

34:03.041 --> 34:05.624
All this is just what was.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.129
There's gotta
be somethin' after.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.056
What happened
to their guns?

34:30.150 --> 34:31.733
Was that you?

34:31.820 --> 34:34.858
It was.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.655
I introduced
a sabotaging aspect

34:36.741 --> 34:39.402
to the manufacturing process
unbeknownst to my colleagues,

34:39.494 --> 34:43.408
inspired by Gabriel's
purposeful ineptitude.

34:43.498 --> 34:47.331
And a few things you imparted
to me before I vomited on you.

34:47.418 --> 34:52.255
Ergo, I created a modicum
of phooey for a full kablooey.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.932
(grunts)

35:05.437 --> 35:07.348
That's for the puke.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.182
Fair play-

35:14.779 --> 35:16.645
It's for Henry.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.908
Will you tell him
I'm gonna be okay?

35:22.537 --> 35:23.743
Are you?

35:25.457 --> 35:27.039
I'm gonna try.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.706
I know I need to be.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.926
(chuckles)

35:45.894 --> 35:48.932
My mew)!"-

35:49.022 --> 35:54.313
prevails... over my wrath.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.609
(chuckles)

35:56.696 --> 35:59.609
(crying)

36:18.385 --> 36:22.504
(brakes squeal)

36:22.597 --> 36:23.587
(engine shuts off)

36:23.682 --> 36:25.639
H9)!-

36:25.725 --> 36:28.092
What the hell you doing?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.642
Hmm?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.141
Sittin' there
like you belong.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.313
No, this shit ain't settled.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.613
What you should've done
is run.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.867
Get in.

36:48.498 --> 36:49.909
Get in the damn truck.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.162
Get up!

37:05.640 --> 37:07.802
Alden:
Excuse me. Maggie?

37:09.644 --> 37:12.227
The... guys are going
back to the Sanctuary.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.476
Gonna... try and make
something else out of it.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.605
I don't know.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.357
The thing is...

37:21.448 --> 37:23.610
I was never meant
to be there.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.067
L-I've been reading

37:26.161 --> 37:28.903
that book, uh...
"A Key to a Future."

37:31.666 --> 37:33.156
You know,
I-l can build things,

37:33.251 --> 37:34.616
I can make
some of that stuff real,

37:34.711 --> 37:39.080
for-- for this place,
for these people.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.087
It-- It's what I want
to do with my life.

37:45.013 --> 37:50.053
And, no joke, you, uh--
you gave me that life, so...

37:52.187 --> 37:53.928
Okay-

38:15.543 --> 38:17.955
(brakes squeal)

38:18.046 --> 38:19.912
(engine shuts off)

38:26.221 --> 38:29.680
Hi.
Glad you're here.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.724
Glad to be here.
I think.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.893
Tanya: Well, we know.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.980
That you guys?

38:42.070 --> 38:44.983
Yeah, more glass.

38:45.073 --> 38:48.816
And more people to help
put it back together.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.509
(brakes squeal)

39:12.600 --> 39:15.342
(engine shuts off)

39:15.436 --> 39:17.097
Daryl: Get out.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.563
(truck door closes)

39:27.657 --> 39:30.570
(breathes deeply)

39:35.582 --> 39:37.573
(sighs)

39:43.131 --> 39:45.122
I know why I'm here.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.929
I know what I did
to Denise.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.759
To you.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.016
To other people.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.353
And it doesn't matter why.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.104
I knew I'd have
to face it...

40:09.198 --> 40:12.065
to pay, and I should.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.279
I'm ready.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.629
I got to see Negan taken down,
and that's enough.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.753
(breathes deeply)

40:28.843 --> 40:30.754
Me?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.717
I'm a piece of shit.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.640
There's no going back
to how things were.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.694
(breathes deeply)

40:52.784 --> 40:55.617
<i>(cries)</i>

40:55.703 --> 40:57.614
I'm sorry.

40:57.705 --> 41:01.039
Look, I'm so sorry.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.991
Please.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.128
(crying) Please.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.376
Shut up.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.798
(keys rattle)

41:10.885 --> 41:13.673
(shuddered breathing)

41:15.682 --> 41:18.970
You go,
and you keep going.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.892
Don't you ever
come back here again.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.266
If I ever see
your face around here again,

41:23.356 --> 41:25.097
I'll kill you.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.943
You go out there,
and you make it right.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.740
Find her.

41:46.421 --> 41:50.255
(pencil scratching)

41:50.341 --> 41:53.629
(knock on door)

41:53.720 --> 41:57.088
Morgan:
I'm a friend of Rick's.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.513
From Alexandria.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.090
(door opens)

42:17.076 --> 42:20.660
He says you can come
back to the community.

42:20.747 --> 42:24.331
If you wanna.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.079
Why?

42:27.170 --> 42:29.127
Rick is trying
to build something.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.703
(bag thuds)

42:30.798 --> 42:34.041
He needs
all the hands he can get.

42:34.135 --> 42:37.127
He wants to show people
that things can change.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.889
You don't want to be alone.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.142
People.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.770
Everything is about people.

42:51.861 --> 42:55.104
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.321
What's your name?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.402
(chuckles)

43:04.582 --> 43:05.913
Morgan Jones.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.368
Um...

43:09.462 --> 43:11.544
You can call me Anne.

43:13.341 --> 43:15.082
Let me get my things.

43:15.176 --> 43:16.462
- We can go.
- Or you can go.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.509
I'm gonna stay.

43:18.596 --> 43:22.510
I want to be alone.
I, um...

43:22.600 --> 43:24.511
I need to be.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.763
I thought you said--

43:25.853 --> 43:27.890
They are, but I can't.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.853
I can't.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.632
(vehicle approaching)

44:04.767 --> 44:07.304
(brakes squeal)

44:07.395 --> 44:10.387
(engine idling)

44:38.259 --> 44:40.842
(chuckles)

45:07.371 --> 45:09.078
Maggie: I just wanted to say
you were right.

45:09.165 --> 45:11.827
About saving the Saviors
from the satellite outpost.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.077
Having them here.

45:16.172 --> 45:19.381
I don't regret
what I did.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.425
But you were right.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.503
And Rick was right about
not killing all the Saviors.

45:27.516 --> 45:28.881
He was right.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.388
He was.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.186
Not about Negan.

45:34.982 --> 45:37.440
So what does that mean,
Maggie?

45:37.526 --> 45:41.110
We have a lot to do.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.780
We have to build
this place up,

45:43.866 --> 45:47.075
make it work
better than before,

45:47.161 --> 45:49.528
make it thrive
for the people who live here.

45:51.707 --> 45:54.449
We need our strength,

45:54.543 --> 45:57.410
the ability
to defend ourselves better.

45:57.505 --> 45:59.087
We have to have that.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.665
We will.

46:01.759 --> 46:06.003
But Rick and Michonne...

46:06.097 --> 46:08.885
Rick was wrong
to do what he did.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.929
Michonne, too.

46:15.231 --> 46:19.725
So we're gonna bide our time,
wait for our moment...

46:23.072 --> 46:24.858
and then
we're gonna show him.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.532
Daryl: Yeah.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.161
We will.

46:38.754 --> 46:41.917
Michonne:
We know you're awake.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.498
I never said I wasn't.

46:43.592 --> 46:45.799
Good.

46:45.886 --> 46:49.299
Because we need
to tell you some things.

46:49.390 --> 46:53.054
And you don't
have to open your eyes now.

46:53.144 --> 46:56.182
But you're gonna
open them soon.

46:56.272 --> 47:01.142
Because we're gonna
make you watch what happens.

47:01.235 --> 47:04.978
Rick: And this isn't
about who you killed.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.483
No, we've--
we killed people.

47:06.574 --> 47:09.407
No, this is about
what you did to us,

47:09.493 --> 47:12.656
what you did
to so many people.

47:12.747 --> 47:14.863
How you made people
live for you,

47:14.957 --> 47:16.493
how you put people
under your boot.

47:16.584 --> 47:17.949
I saved people!

47:18.044 --> 47:19.330
(gasps)

47:19.420 --> 47:21.002
Michonne.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.500
- (grunts)
- He needs to know.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.503
This isn't a discussion.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.050
Rick: We can open up
his stitches

47:28.137 --> 47:31.220
for a little while
just to remind him.

47:33.476 --> 47:36.184
Carl pictured
something better.

47:38.606 --> 47:41.348
All of us working together

47:41.442 --> 47:43.774
for something bigger
than all of us.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.696
And you'll have a job,
too.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.899
Yeah.

47:50.993 --> 47:53.405
You get
to be a part of it.

47:53.496 --> 47:57.114
You'll be an example
of what this will be.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.870
We're not gonna kill you.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.419
We're not gonna hurt you.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.668
You're gonna rot in a cell.

48:05.758 --> 48:11.754
For the rest of your life,
day after day.

48:11.847 --> 48:13.758
You're gonna be evidence

48:13.849 --> 48:17.058
that we're makin'
a civilization,

48:17.144 --> 48:19.556
something like what we had,

48:19.647 --> 48:21.263
something we're gonna
get back.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.065
Michonne: And you get
to watch it happen.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.768
And you get to see
how wrong you were

48:26.862 --> 48:31.481
about what people can be,
about what life can be.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.068
You, alive,
is gonna help show people

48:35.162 --> 48:37.950
that things
have changed,

48:38.040 --> 48:42.580
that keepin' you breathing
earns another way, a better way.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.421
That's the part you'll play.

48:47.508 --> 48:49.966
So after all this...

48:52.012 --> 48:54.845
maybe you're good
for something.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.061
(birds chirping)

49:26.714 --> 49:30.173
(sighs)

49:33.596 --> 49:35.303
Thank you.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.507
Thank you.

49:40.561 --> 49:42.302
I understand.

49:44.273 --> 49:45.889
I know now.

49:48.277 --> 49:50.188
You've given me so much...

49:53.240 --> 49:55.607
...after you've given me
so much.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.537
I can see.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.169
Rick: Dear Carl.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.549
<i>I remember.</i>

50:24.146 --> 50:27.013
<i>I forgot who I was.</i>

50:27.107 --> 50:29.519
<i>You made me remember.</i>

50:29.610 --> 50:36.357
<i>I remember that feeling,
walking with you that day.</i>

50:36.450 --> 50:38.612
<i>Like I finally knew who I was</i>

50:38.702 --> 50:41.285

50:44.667 --> 50:47.534
<i>Thing is, we were walking

50:47.628 --> 50:50.211
but you were

50:50.297 --> 50:52.709
Brin gin <i>'</i> me here.

50:52.800 --> 50:58.045
<i>Bringin' all of us

50:58.138 --> 51:01.256
<i>You showed me the new world.</i>

51:01.350 --> 51:06.060
<i>You made it real.</i>

51:06.146 --> 51:08.558
