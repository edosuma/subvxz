is outrageous.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.179
Because you scheduled a meeting
with the attorney general.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.682
St-strictly to update him, not
to tell him what happened --

19:44.684 --> 19:46.317
Not that anything
did happen.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.953
I gave you a suspect.
I expect you to use him...Soon.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.931
What?

19:59.933 --> 20:01.699
You could say hello.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.468
Hello, olivia.
What do you want?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.539
Olivia?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.508
Can you just...

20:10.510 --> 20:12.977
Be...

20:12.979 --> 20:16.547
I don't know, nice,
for a minute, to me?

20:16.549 --> 20:21.752
Can you be a dad --
normal, kind, regular dad --

20:21.754 --> 20:24.855
For just a few seconds
for me, please?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.959
I'm asking --
I'm really asking, here,

20:27.961 --> 20:30.861
Because I --
I really need it. I...

20:30.863 --> 20:32.697
I need my dad.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.301
[ sighs ]

20:38.537 --> 20:39.704
What?

20:41.006 --> 20:44.542
I don't know
what the point is...

20:44.544 --> 20:46.577
Of this...

20:46.579 --> 20:52.750
Of democracy and freedom
and patriotism.

20:52.752 --> 20:57.722
If there are no white hats,
if everyone is evil,

20:57.724 --> 21:00.791
If the deck is always stacked,
if everyone I love is a monster,

21:00.793 --> 21:04.929
If no one is worth saving,
what's the point?

21:04.931 --> 21:05.930
[ chuckles ]

21:05.932 --> 21:08.833
I'm asking you.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.869
I'm actually asking you.
What is the point?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.537
What happened?

21:13.539 --> 21:16.641
Sally langston murdered
daniel douglas,

21:16.643 --> 21:19.377
And jake killed three people
to cover it up,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.379
Including
cyrus beene's husband.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.480
Oh, that.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.981
"oh, that"?

21:23.983 --> 21:25.950
Mm-hmm.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.885
[ voice breaking ]
forget it.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.288
Sit down.
Sit...

21:30.290 --> 21:31.589
Down.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.895
You want me to be your dad,
I'll be your dad.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.412
183.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.349
That's the number of people
I'm responsible for killing --

21:58.351 --> 22:00.017
Not the number of people
I've killed,

22:00.019 --> 22:02.953
The number
I'm    <i>responsib</i>for.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.755
There's a difference.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.490
You get an order
to kill someone,

22:06.492 --> 22:08.025
Well, maybe
you pull the trigger,

22:08.027 --> 22:09.894
But it's not on you.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.862
<i>They</i> ordered it.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.465
If you didn't kill the poor
bastard, somebody else would.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.601
But when you
become command,

22:17.603 --> 22:20.838
You are <i>the</i> one
giving the orders.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.075
You are <i>the</i> one
making the decisions.

22:24.077 --> 22:27.878
You have to choose
who lives, who dies.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.048
You are responsible.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.852
So you become...

22:34.854 --> 22:36.954
The hand of god.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.926
183.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.961
I know
all of their names.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.864
I know how old they were,
if they had children,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.699
If they would be missed.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.701
183.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.070
I never made
a decision lightly.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.506
I always suffered
a bit with each one.

22:55.508 --> 23:00.044
The responsibility of that,
the gravity of that,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.380
The weight of it,
it marks me.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.616
It stains me.
It never leaves me.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.952
I am responsible.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.820
183.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.656
So, whatever you think
of jake,

23:12.658 --> 23:15.726
However you want
to punish him,

23:15.728 --> 23:17.962
Being the hand of god

23:17.964 --> 23:21.966
Is already the worst
punishment in the world.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.739
And there is,
incidentally, a point.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.041
If there are
no more white hats,

23:31.043 --> 23:33.611
If the deck
is always stacked,

23:33.613 --> 23:36.447
And if everyone you love
is a monster,

23:36.449 --> 23:40.451
There is, in fact,
someone worth saving.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.452
Who?

23:41.454 --> 23:42.920
Everyone!

23:43.989 --> 23:46.891
Everyone
is worth saving!

23:46.893 --> 23:48.659
Even the monsters.
Even the demons.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.996
Everyone
is worth saving.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.031
In the face of darkness,

23:54.033 --> 23:58.669
You drag everyone
into the light.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.805
That is the point.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.642
At least, I like to think
that is the point of you.

24:07.045 --> 24:08.879
[ crying softly ]

24:20.759 --> 24:22.059
[ sighs ]

24:30.936 --> 24:34.505
Am I finished...
Being dad now?

24:34.507 --> 24:36.106
Are we done?

24:51.156 --> 24:52.990
Hut!

24:56.061 --> 24:58.128
Good shooting, dick.
Appreciate it,
andy.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.865
Certainly underestimated
your abilities, governor.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.566
Not bad
for california.

25:02.568 --> 25:03.834
[ chuckles ]
despite the hippies,

25:03.836 --> 25:05.669
There's still plenty
of wild west back home.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.605
Yeah, I just wish
your boy fitz

25:07.607 --> 25:09.974
Had brought more of your spirit
to his first term.

25:09.976 --> 25:14.712
But I'm gonna have to go with
sally langston this time around.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.214
What if my husband were to make
some kind of gesture?

25:17.216 --> 25:20.251
Uh, whatever gesture would
make you feel more confident

25:20.253 --> 25:22.019
About his position
on these matters.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.923
A speech from the white house
would seem to do the trick.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.093
Andrew: They're still
leaning towards langston,

25:29.095 --> 25:30.728
But they've agreed
to switch horses

25:30.730 --> 25:33.097
Affirming your support
for the second amendment.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.932
I mean, I know
the timing's not great.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.200
That's an
understatement.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.735
But, all in all,
it's good news.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.136
Thanks for
the hard work, andy.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.638
It was mellie
who struck the deal.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.773
I was too busy worrying
about the recoil.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.642
She's right here.
Want to thank her yourself?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.610
I'll see her
when you guys get back.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.212
Right.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.247
Well, what did he say?
He loved it.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.715
Wanted to thank you
for your hard work.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.019
Was that andrew
calling from houston?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.554
Yeah, they want to make
some kind of deal.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.088
A big speech, yeah.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.957
Mellie's chief of staff
filled me in. Don't do it.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.659
Cyrus, when was
the last time you ate?

26:01.661 --> 26:02.793
Lauren, call down
to the kitchen.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.128
Have them
bring us up some food.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.129
What?
I'm fine.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.631
Cyrus --
I'm fine.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.067
She can bring me
a new press secretary.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.937
Sheila's been a damn
train wreck down there.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.941
Now, about this speech --
you can't do it.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.610
Yes, it gives us
our base back,

26:19.612 --> 26:20.811
But look at who
we're up against --

26:20.813 --> 26:23.814
A democrat
who shot his wife's rapist

26:23.816 --> 26:27.985
Who might love guns even more
than she loves jesus.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.920
So you're saying --
I'm saying

26:29.922 --> 26:31.989
Let's steal some votes
from the left

26:31.991 --> 26:33.991
And worry about winning
the base back later.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.893
By coming out in favor
of gun control?

26:35.895 --> 26:37.628
Your press secretary was shot,
mr. President.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.731
It's a perfect opportunity
to shift positions

26:40.733 --> 26:42.633
Without looking
like a flip-flopper.

26:42.635 --> 26:43.767
[ sighs ]

26:43.769 --> 26:46.670
It's a smart move
politically, but...

26:48.340 --> 26:50.374
...Using what happened today
to get votes --

26:50.376 --> 26:52.176
You sure
you're okay with that?

26:52.178 --> 26:54.745
If we can turn some
purple states red, why not?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.747
Mr. President.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.382
Cyrus, I thought
you'd gone home.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.985
Uh, I was hoping to discuss
something with you

27:00.987 --> 27:02.686
Before I left.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.689
Sir...
It's important.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.696

I'm s-seeing someone.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.703
That's wonderful.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.205
Is this the first person
you've started seeing

27:21.207 --> 27:22.206
Since the divorce?

27:22.208 --> 27:23.374
It is.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.743
And it's serious?

27:25.745 --> 27:26.744
It is.

Well,
good for you, cy.

Do you...

27:34.186 --> 27:37.321
Want to tell me anything else
about this person?

...A journalist.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.231
A journalist?

journalist.

a problem?

Of course not.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.375
Good. Okay.

all that matters.

We cannot -- we will not --

28:31.243 --> 28:34.244
Sit idly by
in the face of such tragedy.

We must work together
to put an end to gun violence

The president's decision

28:50.196 --> 28:51.962
To admonish
the nation's gun lobby

Is being hailed as bold
but brilliant

By a vast majority
of independents this evening.

What is so bad about
stiffer background checks?

Everything! Are you insane
like fitz or just stupid?!

So, you're saying three days
is too long to wait for a gun?

29:14.520 --> 29:18.388
So -- so, you're okay
with a depressed teenager

29:18.390 --> 29:20.424
Or a criminal
walking out of prison,

29:20.426 --> 29:21.925
Hell-bent on revenge,

29:21.927 --> 29:23.994
Walking into his friendly
neighborhood gun shop

29:23.996 --> 29:26.430
And walking out
with an ak-47?

29:26.432 --> 29:30.501
The point is, the vast majority
of violent crimes

29:30.503 --> 29:32.035
Are committed
with black-market guns.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.871
No self-respecting gangster
is gonna walk into

gun shop to get a piece.

We may as well put
background checks on vodka.

Ordering a beer is not
the same thing as buying a gun!

of sense.

and disturbing

pretty scary --
