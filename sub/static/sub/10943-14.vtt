WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:01.818
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.819 --> 00:03.419
- You hired a lawyer?
- Yeah.

00:03.485 --> 00:05.421
You gotta have a lawyer
to win a custody case.

00:05.488 --> 00:06.789
You know, I don't
know how great it would be

00:06.857 --> 00:07.824
especially if you have
to ruin Miranda's life

00:07.891 --> 00:09.325
in order for it
to happen.

00:09.392 --> 00:11.026
Well, you might think that
Miranda's a wonderful person,

00:11.094 --> 00:12.794
but she moved that kid
from pillar to post

00:12.862 --> 00:14.129
his entire life.

00:14.197 --> 00:15.396
I talked to Lisa
this morning

00:15.464 --> 00:16.865
and suddenly there are
a ton of bookings

00:16.933 --> 00:18.333
coming up at the cabins.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.434
Why would she be taking
bookings?

00:19.501 --> 00:20.769
She knew that
we were starting.

00:20.837 --> 00:22.137
Well, we told her
we've been starting for weeks,

00:22.205 --> 00:24.606
so I guess she just sort of...
Gave up on us.

00:24.673 --> 00:27.007
Figure you might be looking
for these sooner or later.

00:27.075 --> 00:28.275
To tell you the truth,

00:28.343 --> 00:29.910
I haven't given the bikes
a second thought.

00:29.978 --> 00:31.245
But it's all Ty's been
talking about

00:31.312 --> 00:32.713
since he got out
of the hospital.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.620
According to my lawyer,

00:39.687 --> 00:42.623
Miranda definitely qualifies
as an unfit mother.

00:42.690 --> 00:44.724
Get outta there,
you no-good mutton!

00:44.792 --> 00:46.392
And it's not just
the casinos

00:46.460 --> 00:48.594
and the empty
wine bottles-

00:48.662 --> 00:50.196
You went through
her garbage?

00:50.264 --> 00:51.798
Well, no!
Of course not.

00:51.866 --> 00:53.032
It was her recycling.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.734
And it wasn't me,
it was my detective.

00:54.802 --> 00:57.771
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Tim,

00:57.838 --> 01:00.305
but even if Miranda is
the worst mother in the world -

01:00.373 --> 01:02.040
<i>which I highly doubt -</i>

01:02.108 --> 01:03.909
<i>that doesn't all of a sudden
make you an ideal father.</i>

01:03.977 --> 01:05.543
That's what my lawyer said!

01:05.611 --> 01:07.379
<i>He says I gotta work at being
a family man, you know?</i>

01:07.446 --> 01:10.282
Show 'em that I got roots
in the community.

01:10.349 --> 01:13.152
So that's why you volunteered
to coach Little Britches?

01:13.219 --> 01:14.519
Yeah. Even if it means

01:14.587 --> 01:16.154
teaching a bunch
of little kids

01:16.221 --> 01:17.688
how to ride sheep!

01:31.669 --> 01:34.271
They weren't even supposed
to come today.

01:34.338 --> 01:37.107
You know, if you took
a complimentary trail ride,

01:37.175 --> 01:39.242
you wouldn't hear a thing.

01:40.211 --> 01:41.411
Thank you for choosing

01:41.478 --> 01:43.479
the Heartland
Equestrian Connection.

01:43.547 --> 01:44.747
I'm sure you'll be back.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.494
Still spoiling Ty,
I see?

01:59.562 --> 02:01.831
Well, it's only been
a few days, Lou.

02:01.898 --> 02:03.031
He needs to get
his strength back,

02:03.098 --> 02:05.099
and he needs rest,
and he needs...

02:05.167 --> 02:06.500
Breakfast in bed
with his girlfriend?

02:07.036 --> 02:08.536
<i>I used to do
romantic things like that</i>

02:08.603 --> 02:09.804
for Peter all the time,

02:09.872 --> 02:12.974
but now, with the job
and the baby...

02:13.042 --> 02:14.475
Hey, whose baby is that?
Huh?

02:14.543 --> 02:15.776
What's your angle?
I'll buy that.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.245
<i>No, no, no. Not you.
Uh, yeah.</i>

02:17.313 --> 02:19.012
I'll be there in, like,
an hour and a half, tops.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.247
Yeah. Bye.

02:20.315 --> 02:21.815
Okay, we gotta go.

02:21.883 --> 02:24.451
Yeah.
Oh, do you mind if I-? Thanks.

02:32.626 --> 02:34.661
Lou, honey, I
have to talk to you.

02:34.729 --> 02:38.097
Um... honey, please,
could you- thank you.

02:38.165 --> 02:39.398
About what?

02:39.466 --> 02:40.933
The bulldozer
that's digging a hole

02:41.001 --> 02:42.168
down at the dude ranch.

02:42.236 --> 02:44.270
You're kidding!
The actually started? Wow!

02:44.338 --> 02:45.671
Yeah, they sure did.

02:45.739 --> 02:47.039
Cabin one's demanding
a refund,

02:47.107 --> 02:48.540
cabin three drove off
without paying,

02:48.608 --> 02:49.742
and cabin two is coming
this afternoon!

02:49.809 --> 02:50.843
It's booked.

02:50.910 --> 02:52.344
That's terrible.
I didn't know.

02:52.411 --> 02:53.845
I need some warning.

02:53.913 --> 02:55.513
I really-
I didn't know, Lisa.

02:55.581 --> 02:58.549
And, um, to be fair,
you agreed to it, so...

03:00.077 --> 03:01.086
Maybe I did,

03:01.153 --> 03:03.221
but that was for then,
and not for now.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.756
Now is the worst time
ever!

03:04.823 --> 03:06.324
Lisa, I am trying
to stay on top

03:06.392 --> 03:07.925
of every little thing.

03:07.993 --> 03:10.160
I have a job,
I have a baby-

03:10.228 --> 03:13.097
<i>Hon, we gotta step on it;
We're gonna be late for work.</i>

03:13.164 --> 03:14.331
And I have a husband.

03:14.399 --> 03:16.800
I'm sorry,
but now is not the time.

03:16.868 --> 03:18.202
I'm sorry.

03:18.270 --> 03:19.169
Well, if it's not
a good time for you,

03:19.237 --> 03:20.371
I'm gonna take care
of it.

03:20.438 --> 03:22.139
We'll talk, I promise.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.518
Good morning.

03:36.787 --> 03:38.121
Caleb!

03:38.188 --> 03:39.388
Oh, that smells delicious!

03:39.455 --> 03:40.622
You didn't have
to do that for me.

03:40.689 --> 03:41.756
What're you doing here?

03:41.824 --> 03:42.791
I was sleeping.

03:42.858 --> 03:44.126
I was on the road
all night.

03:44.193 --> 03:46.261
But now that I'm up,
don't mind if I do.

03:46.329 --> 03:48.430
Hey! That's for Ty.

03:49.498 --> 03:51.033
Put it back.

03:52.735 --> 03:54.002
Where is he?

03:54.070 --> 03:55.536
He said he had
to get to work.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.804
Glad he's doing
better though,

03:56.871 --> 03:59.907
I mean after the accident
and all.

04:10.152 --> 04:12.152
What're you doing
out here?

04:12.219 --> 04:14.354
I was just checking out
my bike.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.888
It's not as bad as I thought.

04:15.957 --> 04:19.459
I should have it up
and running in no time.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.094
What's this?

04:21.161 --> 04:24.331
Well, I was hoping
to bring you breakfast in bed.

04:26.898 --> 04:29.234
Well,
that would've been great,

04:29.302 --> 04:31.670
except for the Caleb factor.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.840
Well, will you look at that.

04:34.907 --> 04:38.577
Stumpy's running for president
of the cowboy association again.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.414
You know, they should just
save everybody a lot of trouble

04:42.482 --> 04:44.282
and make him president for life.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.418
I can't remember the last time
anybody even came close.

04:47.486 --> 04:49.787
I bet that job comes with
a lot of responsibility.

04:49.855 --> 04:52.690
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You organize a barbecue,

04:52.757 --> 04:54.192
you ride a horse
in the parade,

04:54.259 --> 04:56.260
look good in
a cowboy hat.

04:56.328 --> 04:59.029
President of the local
cowboy association...

04:59.097 --> 05:02.466
Wanna talk about a pillar
of the community.

05:02.533 --> 05:05.702
Oh. Today's the last day
for nomination.

05:05.769 --> 05:08.138
Darn the luck.
Always next year.

05:08.206 --> 05:09.672
Yeah, or...

05:09.740 --> 05:10.840
Or we could drive
by the Association

05:10.908 --> 05:11.841
on the way home,

05:11.909 --> 05:12.942
fill out the form.

05:13.011 --> 05:14.211
You gotta be
kidding me.

05:14.278 --> 05:15.511
I just need member
in good standing

05:15.578 --> 05:17.146
to nominate me.

05:17.214 --> 05:20.416
No way. Forget it.
Not a chance.

06:06.326 --> 06:07.560
You know, I am
gonna need a point man,

06:07.627 --> 06:09.728
like somebody to run
my campaign.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.997
I'm already starting
to regret getting involved.

06:12.066 --> 06:12.998
You know, I'm a
little disappointed

06:13.067 --> 06:14.600
in your attitude, Jack.

06:14.668 --> 06:15.901
Having a family member
as president

06:15.969 --> 06:17.070
might be the only shot
you get

06:17.137 --> 06:18.337
at getting into
the hall of fame.

06:18.405 --> 06:19.571
I didn't nominate you

06:19.638 --> 06:21.806
so I could get into
the hall of fame.

06:21.874 --> 06:23.775
Matter of fact,
I didn't do it for you at all.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.909
For better or worse,

06:24.977 --> 06:26.611
you're the only father
Shane has.

06:26.679 --> 06:27.879
And I can't help thinking

06:27.947 --> 06:29.581
that kid deserves to be
part of a family,

06:29.648 --> 06:31.950
even if you're in it!

06:34.554 --> 06:37.188
Hey, sorry,
I've gotta ask.

06:37.255 --> 06:40.124
What's up
with you and Ash?

06:40.192 --> 06:41.959
Next time I go to Vancouver
to save my marriage,

06:42.026 --> 06:43.961
you can help me out
and...tie me up,

06:44.028 --> 06:45.162
get me drunk,

06:45.230 --> 06:46.530
maybe hit me on the head
with a hammer...

06:46.598 --> 06:48.599
Anything like that'd
be good.

06:51.368 --> 06:52.635
You're sure you're ready
to move back?

06:52.703 --> 06:54.770
Yeah. All my tools
are there.

06:54.838 --> 06:56.406
I gotta get this
job done.

06:56.474 --> 06:58.308
- I know.
- It's okay.

06:59.676 --> 07:01.211
- I'll be fine.
- Yeah.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.556
Hey, Grampa!

07:16.359 --> 07:18.693
Hey... ugh!

07:18.761 --> 07:19.995
What's that smell?

07:20.062 --> 07:21.563
Sheep.

07:21.631 --> 07:23.131
Why do you smell
like sheep?

07:23.198 --> 07:25.799
Your father volunteered
for Little Britches rodeo.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.568
Turns out they're starting
with mutton busting.

07:27.636 --> 07:30.271
Wait. Wait. Dad?
Little Britches?

07:30.339 --> 07:31.572
He hates sheep.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.840
I don't even think
he likes little kids.

07:32.907 --> 07:35.243
Oh, he's trying
to reinvent himself

07:35.310 --> 07:37.345
as an all around
family man,

07:37.412 --> 07:38.979
a big wheel
in the community.

07:39.047 --> 07:40.713
He even got himself
nominated

07:40.781 --> 07:41.881
to run for president

07:41.949 --> 07:43.683
of the Foothills
Cowboy Association.

07:43.751 --> 07:45.585
You're kidding me.

07:45.653 --> 07:48.087
Who would nominate Dad?

07:50.290 --> 07:53.192
It's to help out
with his custody thing.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.493
Mm-hmm.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.328
He's not gonna win
the election, Amy,

07:56.396 --> 07:58.197
'cause Stumpy's
running again.

07:58.265 --> 07:59.431
Can I borrow your truck?

07:59.499 --> 08:00.866
I think I'm gonna go
over there

08:00.933 --> 08:02.535
and see if Dad needs a hand
with those little kids.

08:02.602 --> 08:04.036
I'm sure
he'll be thrilled

08:04.103 --> 08:05.303
with your vote
of confidence.

08:18.651 --> 08:20.051
Oh!
What're you doing?

08:20.118 --> 08:21.018
You're not supposed
to fall off.

08:21.086 --> 08:22.852
Come here!
Get back on now.

08:23.821 --> 08:25.689
The whole point is
to stay on the sheep,

08:25.756 --> 08:27.023
<i>not fall off the sheep.</i>

08:27.091 --> 08:28.325
<i>You're supposed to stay on.</i>

08:28.393 --> 08:30.026
Dad!

08:30.094 --> 08:31.361
Just get back up there;
That's the whole point.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.597
Ride the sheep.
What?

08:33.664 --> 08:36.299
Oh, hi, honey.
Okay, who's next?

08:36.366 --> 08:37.433
Are you next?

08:37.501 --> 08:39.001
You're not afraid,
are you?

08:39.068 --> 08:40.769
If you kids wanna be in
a real rodeo someday,

08:40.837 --> 08:42.037
you gotta cowboy up.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.706
Dad!

08:43.773 --> 08:45.575
Stop shouting at them, okay?
That's not gonna help anything.

08:45.642 --> 08:47.510
This is mutton busting!
It's supposed to be fun!

08:47.578 --> 08:50.112
How the hell can
riding sheep be fun?

08:50.180 --> 08:53.048
Okay, come on.
Get back in line there.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.148
Let's go!

08:59.388 --> 09:00.288
Do you have any
idea what's going on

09:00.356 --> 09:01.856
down at the dude ranch?

09:01.924 --> 09:03.891
Well, I could guess.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.294
Lou and Peter have been
talking for weeks

09:06.362 --> 09:09.263
about how the work's
gonna start any day now.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.997
Well, it certainly has.

09:11.065 --> 09:13.100
And it could not be
at a worse possible time!

09:13.167 --> 09:16.036
It's leaf peeping season.

09:16.104 --> 09:18.905
Did you...
Just say leaf peeping?

09:18.973 --> 09:20.507
Yes, I did.

09:20.575 --> 09:24.144
Many tourists like to come
and look at the fall foliage!

09:24.212 --> 09:25.778
And not to mention
the elk rut.

09:25.846 --> 09:29.148
The place is booked solid
for the next month.

09:29.216 --> 09:32.285
So - hate to do this
to you -

09:32.353 --> 09:34.721
but would you mind talking
to Lou for me?

09:36.223 --> 09:38.758
Why is one of you
always asking me

09:38.825 --> 09:40.560
to talk to the other one
for you?

09:40.628 --> 09:41.660
That's not true.

09:41.728 --> 09:43.695
Last time it was Lou.
I said no.

09:43.763 --> 09:45.631
Now you want me
to talk to her.

09:45.698 --> 09:47.733
Well, I mean,
the dude ranch is on your land.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.602
Technically, no,
you're not a partner, but...

09:50.670 --> 09:52.036
Lis...

09:52.104 --> 09:55.307
I don't wanna get caught
in a crossfire.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.276
I would never do that
to you.

09:59.344 --> 10:03.347
All right, on your
marks, get set... go!

10:08.420 --> 10:09.720
You see, guys?

10:09.788 --> 10:11.155
They're always gonna run back
to their friends,

10:11.222 --> 10:12.723
so you don't have
to worry about them

10:12.791 --> 10:14.824
running off on you,
okay?

10:17.161 --> 10:18.662
Parrrrump! Parrrrump! Parrrump!

10:18.729 --> 10:20.029
Come on, Dad!
Come on!

10:20.097 --> 10:22.031
You can do better than that!

10:23.334 --> 10:25.402
'Kay, get off!
Ungh! My back!

10:27.505 --> 10:29.371
Go finish!

10:29.439 --> 10:31.540
Okay, so you've
seen how they run -

10:31.608 --> 10:32.841
and you've ridden something

10:32.909 --> 10:35.678
a whole lot more scary
than a sheep -

10:35.745 --> 10:37.513
so who's ready to do
some mutton busting?

10:37.580 --> 10:38.914
Meeeeee!

10:39.816 --> 10:42.217
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no, I'll give you-

10:42.285 --> 10:43.985
I've decided:
A hundred posters

10:44.053 --> 10:45.353
for two box seats
at the Stampede,

10:45.421 --> 10:46.521
I guess. Okay.

10:46.588 --> 10:47.622
Dad!

10:47.690 --> 10:48.989
<i>Just a sec.</i>

10:49.057 --> 10:51.726
Yup. No, that's it.
Yeah, that's good. Thanks.

11:41.974 --> 11:43.341
What's going on?

11:44.309 --> 11:45.643
Ah, well,

11:45.711 --> 11:47.445
I think I've pretty well
got it now.

11:47.513 --> 11:49.747
You know, I don't know
a lot about motorcycles,

11:49.814 --> 11:51.482
but...
I thought you said,

11:51.549 --> 11:52.883
you didn't have
a lot of work to do?

11:52.950 --> 11:56.119
I guess once I got started,
I went a little crazy.

11:56.187 --> 11:57.821
So what now?
Are you just gonna...

11:57.889 --> 11:59.390
Put it all back together?

11:59.457 --> 12:01.291
Um, I gotta make sure

12:01.359 --> 12:02.959
I haven't missed
anything first.

12:03.027 --> 12:04.961
Hey, do you wanna come over
for dinner later...

12:05.029 --> 12:06.328
Or something?

12:08.432 --> 12:10.600
Um, yeah,
that's sounds great...

12:10.667 --> 12:12.134
But I...

12:12.202 --> 12:14.036
I got a lot of work to do,
so I can't.

12:25.047 --> 12:26.848
You know, after the fuss
that Lisa made,

12:26.916 --> 12:29.718
I would've thought
this'd be a lot bigger.

12:29.786 --> 12:31.653
Yeah. Yeah,
well, it should be, honey!

12:31.721 --> 12:33.187
It should be a lot bigger.

12:33.255 --> 12:34.255
It should be
ten times as big!

12:34.323 --> 12:36.691
This is unbelievable.

12:36.759 --> 12:37.958
We're paying this guy a fortune,
you know,

12:38.026 --> 12:39.192
and this all he gets done?

12:39.260 --> 12:40.461
He's way behind schedule.

12:40.529 --> 12:41.562
Honey...

12:47.368 --> 12:50.103
Yeah, hey. Hi.
It's Peter Morris calling.

12:50.171 --> 12:51.505
Um...

12:51.573 --> 12:53.173
I'm standing here at the site
and I...

12:53.241 --> 12:55.442
Like what's...
What happened here, buddy?

12:55.509 --> 12:57.310
Were you here
for like five minutes?

12:57.377 --> 12:58.778
I mean, honestly,
weeks of waiting,

12:58.846 --> 13:00.379
and you show up
and this all you get done?

13:00.448 --> 13:01.881
I could have done better
by myself!

13:01.949 --> 13:03.316
I...

13:06.420 --> 13:07.487
<i>You know,
it was hard to tell</i>

13:07.555 --> 13:08.655
whether those poor kids

13:08.722 --> 13:10.989
were more afraid
of the sheep or Dad.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
See, I don't see why
Dad was even involved,

13:13.225 --> 13:14.860
especially with sheep
in the mix.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.027
Dad hates sheep.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.362
Yeah, well,
it wasn't about sheep.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.697
It was about Dad
trying to pretend

13:18.765 --> 13:20.699
that he's all about
helping other people.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.001
Or about your dad
using other people

13:23.069 --> 13:24.235
to help himself.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.736
Well, if Dad really wants
to help someone,

13:25.804 --> 13:27.004
he should grab a shovel

13:27.072 --> 13:28.172
and come down
to the dude ranch.

13:28.239 --> 13:30.842
Didn't your contractor
finally show up?

13:30.909 --> 13:33.143
Oh, oh yeah,
he showed up.

13:33.211 --> 13:34.846
That's about all he did,
though.

13:34.913 --> 13:37.314
Took a walk.
No explanation, nothing.

13:37.382 --> 13:38.516
It doesn't make any sense.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.117
We are paying this guy
a fortune.

13:40.185 --> 13:41.619
Well,

13:41.687 --> 13:45.622
You do realize that it's...
Leaf peeping season.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.191
<i>It might not be
the best time of year</i>

13:47.258 --> 13:49.759
<i>to turn the dude ranch
into a construction site.</i>

13:49.827 --> 13:51.395
What, uh...
What're you saying, Jack?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.697
Well, Lisa happened
to mention-

13:53.764 --> 13:56.533
Did she have something to do
with the guy walking out on us?

13:59.569 --> 14:01.004
She was concerned...

14:01.071 --> 14:02.472
She did, didn't she?

14:02.539 --> 14:04.707
Come on! Honestly?
How could she do that to us?

14:04.774 --> 14:07.743
I'm not saying that Lisa
did anything.

14:07.811 --> 14:09.912
<i>But if she did...</i>

14:09.980 --> 14:11.914
You know,
from what I heard,

14:11.982 --> 14:14.116
you two were both
in too big a rush

14:14.183 --> 14:16.818
to even talk about it.

14:18.221 --> 14:21.189
Hey! Good! You're all here.

14:22.825 --> 14:23.858
Am I interrupting?

14:23.926 --> 14:25.027
No. It's perfect timing.

14:25.094 --> 14:26.161
Uh, you mind if I...?

14:26.229 --> 14:27.429
You always do.

14:30.332 --> 14:31.732
"It's time for Tim"?

14:31.799 --> 14:33.234
Really,
that's catchy, Dad.

14:33.301 --> 14:35.336
Yeah, except it kinda looks like
"it's Tim for Tim."

14:35.404 --> 14:37.871
Which makes
it's own kind of sense.

14:37.939 --> 14:39.640
Oh, I know what
you're thinking...

14:39.707 --> 14:41.375
I very much doubt it, Dad.

14:41.443 --> 14:43.877
Except this isn't
about me, okay?

14:43.945 --> 14:45.746
It's not about politics.

14:45.813 --> 14:47.847
It's not about
the cowboy association.

14:47.915 --> 14:49.482
It's about something that...

14:49.550 --> 14:51.351
That we all take
for granted.

14:51.419 --> 14:53.086
It's about us,
it's about this,

14:53.154 --> 14:54.554
it's about family.

14:54.621 --> 14:56.356
It's about having
a stable home,

14:56.424 --> 14:58.391
<i>it's about being able
to sit down</i>

14:58.459 --> 14:59.592
and have dinner

14:59.660 --> 15:01.494
surrounded by friends
and family,

15:01.562 --> 15:04.463
and people you love...
Or even like-

15:04.531 --> 15:06.998
Oh for God's sake, Dad,
give it rest!

15:07.067 --> 15:08.800
Now is not the time!

15:08.868 --> 15:10.302
Honey... honey!

15:11.271 --> 15:12.704
Something I said?

15:15.208 --> 15:17.242
<i>Here you go,
buddy.</i>

15:26.630 --> 15:28.364
Okay, I got his word
this time.

15:28.432 --> 15:29.365
A couple more days.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.400
What?

15:30.467 --> 15:31.734
Two more days, Lou!

15:31.802 --> 15:33.670
That's great.
It solves Lisa's problem.

15:33.737 --> 15:36.739
Yeah... till we start
pouring the concrete.

15:36.807 --> 15:39.542
Concrete...
right. Of course.

15:43.546 --> 15:44.713
So you told them?

15:44.781 --> 15:47.783
Well, not in
so many words.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.218
Well, you know what?
The dude ranch is a business

15:50.286 --> 15:51.620
and I did what was right
for the business.

15:51.688 --> 15:54.255
Yes,
but it's also family.

15:54.324 --> 15:55.691
Believe me, I know.

15:55.758 --> 15:57.826
I'm running it
with your granddaughter.

15:57.893 --> 15:59.194
I'm also Katie's godmother.

15:59.261 --> 16:00.161
Which is why I did it
in the first place -

16:00.229 --> 16:01.562
to help Lou.

16:01.630 --> 16:03.298
And that's why my feelings
are kind of hurt

16:03.365 --> 16:05.333
because she can't even be
bothered to get back to me.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.502
Lisa, you're taking this
way too personally.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.904
But it is personal,
Jack.

16:09.972 --> 16:11.206
It's much more personal

16:11.273 --> 16:13.106
than a business relationship
should be.

16:13.174 --> 16:14.842
You mean, like a business
relationship

16:14.909 --> 16:16.944
you have with Dan?

16:19.814 --> 16:21.215
What are you implying?

16:21.282 --> 16:23.217
Nothing - at all.

16:23.284 --> 16:24.651
Forget it.

16:24.719 --> 16:27.120
I can't forget it.
You keep dredging it up.

16:27.188 --> 16:31.357
Lisa, I'm not trying
to start anything here.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.161
But you are working
pretty close

16:35.229 --> 16:37.296
to the guy you used
to be married to.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.497
This is ridiculous!
You know what?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.432
You can stuff these
things yourself.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.201
Oh, come-
Lisa!

16:45.437 --> 16:46.838
Dad, where are you?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.006
Look, I know you're busy,

16:48.074 --> 16:50.041
but you really need
to be here.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.412
All right! Who's ready
for some pole-bending, huh?

16:54.480 --> 16:55.380
Meeeeeee! Yeah! Me!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.384
Come on, let's go.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.853
So we're gonna zig-zag
through the poles, okay?

17:02.921 --> 17:04.588
Is everybody watching?

17:04.655 --> 17:06.623
Just like this...

17:06.691 --> 17:09.126
All right, carry on.
I know you can do it.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.928
All right, everybody, cheer!

17:13.798 --> 17:14.932
<i>Okay! All right!</i>

17:15.000 --> 17:16.900
Bring her home!
Come on!

17:19.770 --> 17:21.470
Awesome! That was perfect!

17:21.538 --> 17:22.570
Okay,
who wants to try now?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.342
Hey, Caleb.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.912
What's up?
What're you doing here?

17:28.979 --> 17:31.381
Well, I just figured since
Shorty's over at Heartland,

17:31.448 --> 17:33.215
I might as well move
my stuff out of here-

17:33.283 --> 17:34.249
Hey!
Watch the bike!

17:34.317 --> 17:35.284
Ungh!

17:35.351 --> 17:37.920
What the hell
did you do that for?

17:37.987 --> 17:39.288
Sorry, man.

17:39.355 --> 17:41.423
<i>It's just not
back together yet.</i>

17:42.658 --> 17:45.027
I just kinda lost it.

17:45.094 --> 17:47.229
Ow, that hurt.

17:50.999 --> 17:51.999
<i>I've gotta run.
I'm doing a piece</i>

17:52.067 --> 17:54.268
on the new traffic light
on Center,

17:54.336 --> 17:56.003
<i>but my boss's gonna kill me
if I'm late.</i>

17:58.073 --> 17:59.606
'Scuse me,
couldn't help but overhear.

17:59.674 --> 18:01.275
You're a reporter?

18:01.343 --> 18:03.210
Yeah. Nadir Jutley.
Hudson Times.

18:03.278 --> 18:04.678
Tim Fleming.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.547
I'm running for president
of the cowboy association.

18:06.614 --> 18:09.082
Wow! So you're the guy
running against Stumpy.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.751
Yeah. Actually,
that's where you come in.

18:10.819 --> 18:11.885
You know,
a piece in your paper

18:11.953 --> 18:13.420
could really help
my campaign.

18:13.488 --> 18:14.788
You know,
it's time for a change,

18:14.856 --> 18:16.657
or as I like to say,
"it's Time for Tim."

18:18.025 --> 18:19.626
Actually, it's time
I got back to the office.

18:19.694 --> 18:22.528
Nadir, what if
I sweeten the offer?

18:22.596 --> 18:24.430
Say a special
half-price weekend

18:24.498 --> 18:26.799
at the Heartland
Equestrian Connection.

18:26.867 --> 18:28.400
Slow down, Tim.

18:28.469 --> 18:29.735
I can run it
by my editor,

18:29.803 --> 18:31.303
but I can't promise you
anything.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.905
Do you have a card?

18:32.973 --> 18:36.208
Card? Uh, no.
I left those at home.

18:36.276 --> 18:38.543
How about a button?
Here.

18:39.512 --> 18:40.779
There you go.
And my number.

18:40.847 --> 18:42.213
I'll give you my number,

18:42.281 --> 18:44.449
or you could drop by
the rodeo grounds any afternoon

18:44.517 --> 18:47.586
because I'm coaching
Little Britches.

18:47.653 --> 18:48.854
Yeah, well, you know,

18:48.921 --> 18:50.121
the community's given
so much to me,

18:50.189 --> 18:51.356
I just feel honoured

18:51.423 --> 18:52.357
to be able to give
something back.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.358
You know, Tim,
everyone in Hudson

18:54.425 --> 18:56.159
loves Stumpy's
election day barbecue.

18:56.227 --> 18:58.496
I mean,
it's become a tradition.

18:58.563 --> 18:59.997
How are you gonna
beat that?

19:00.064 --> 19:01.198
Well, Nadir, that's...

19:01.265 --> 19:02.700
That's what my campaign's
all about.

19:02.767 --> 19:07.204
My campaign platform is all
about community and family.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.006
And giving back.
Yeah, so you said.

19:10.073 --> 19:11.207
I'll talk to my editor.

19:11.274 --> 19:12.341
Yeah.

19:25.088 --> 19:26.221
Hey!

19:27.657 --> 19:29.024
What's up?

19:29.091 --> 19:31.059
Oh, I just uh...
I just came from the trailer,

19:31.127 --> 19:33.094
and um...

19:33.162 --> 19:34.997
Is everything all right
with you and Ty?

19:35.064 --> 19:36.565
I think so.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.233
Why,
did he say something?

19:38.300 --> 19:40.268
Well,
not in so many words.

19:40.336 --> 19:41.669
Caleb?

19:41.737 --> 19:45.540
Look, motorcycles,
like marriages...

19:45.607 --> 19:47.408
Thing is they're pretty
easy to take apart.

19:47.475 --> 19:48.709
Matter of fact,

19:48.777 --> 19:50.511
you can pretty well do it
all yourself.

19:50.579 --> 19:52.212
Okay...

19:52.280 --> 19:54.549
But when it comes time
to putting it back together?

19:54.616 --> 19:56.517
It's a two-person job.

19:59.486 --> 20:01.621
I went to Vancouver,
and I fought for her,

20:01.689 --> 20:03.289
just like you said.

20:03.357 --> 20:06.993
I did everything I could
to save my marriage.

20:07.061 --> 20:10.597
But Ash wasn't into it,
and I realized that...

20:10.665 --> 20:12.699
It wasn't something
that I could do by myself,

20:12.767 --> 20:14.399
no matter how hard
I tried.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.234
I'm sorry.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.570
Me too.

20:17.637 --> 20:20.873
The deal is...
Ty and that motorcycle?

20:20.941 --> 20:24.142
He can't do it by himself.
He needs your help.

20:34.587 --> 20:36.721
<i>How's it going?</i>

20:36.789 --> 20:38.556
So far, so good.

20:39.524 --> 20:41.626
Yeah, I guess it's a lot easier
to take it apart

20:41.694 --> 20:43.928
than put it back together,
huh?

20:43.996 --> 20:48.164
Yeah, you gotta be more precise
with it all.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.835
So... what can I do?

20:56.240 --> 20:58.108
Well, okay...

21:00.177 --> 21:01.711
Nice.

21:01.778 --> 21:04.513
You know,
when we finish this,

21:04.581 --> 21:07.016
you're gonna have to learn
how to ride one of these things.

21:07.084 --> 21:08.784
Yeah. Right.

21:15.425 --> 21:17.093
Okay, what's next?

21:20.096 --> 21:22.330
This is the easy part.

21:22.397 --> 21:25.600
Yeah, that looks...
dead simple.

21:31.573 --> 21:32.907
Hey, hi.

21:32.975 --> 21:34.508
Hi, Dad.

21:34.575 --> 21:35.876
What do you got there?

21:35.944 --> 21:37.544
Well, you know I don't have
a computer at home,

21:37.612 --> 21:39.680
and you know
Stumpy's barbecue?

21:39.748 --> 21:41.081
Yeah, everyone knows
Stumpy's barbecue.

21:41.149 --> 21:43.117
Okay,
check this out.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.085
"Bater up"?

21:45.153 --> 21:46.553
What?

21:46.621 --> 21:48.989
Oh! That's, that's "batter up."
I'll fix that.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.390
B-a-t-t-e-r...
Batter up!

21:51.458 --> 21:53.059
It's time for Tim's free
all-you-can-eat

21:53.127 --> 21:54.493
election day pancake breakfast!

21:54.561 --> 21:57.096
Hosted by Tim Fleming,
in person,

21:57.164 --> 21:59.532
etcetera, etcetera.
What do you think?

21:59.599 --> 22:02.268
Well, I guess if you
printed it up properly,

22:02.335 --> 22:03.770
used a nice big font...

22:03.837 --> 22:06.371
Yeah, yeah...
Good idea.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.407
Okay, give it to me.

22:09.475 --> 22:12.044
I'll type it up for you
and you can get copies made.

22:12.111 --> 22:13.745
Honey,
thank you so much!

22:13.813 --> 22:15.647
Here's a mailing list of
all the Association members.

22:15.715 --> 22:16.882
Come on, Dad,

22:16.949 --> 22:17.749
you don't honestly
expect me to...

22:17.817 --> 22:19.051
Well, I'd ask Jack,

22:19.118 --> 22:21.553
but he's so useless,
I mean, compared to you.

22:21.620 --> 22:24.321
Okay, just...
Give it to me.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.091
Thank you.

22:27.159 --> 22:30.260
Oh!
I almost forgot...

22:31.362 --> 22:33.564
This is my, uh,
press release.

22:33.631 --> 22:34.732
These are the clippings.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.200
Now, I've written
most of the speech -

22:36.267 --> 22:39.002
it'll probably end up
writing itself.

22:39.070 --> 22:41.171
Yeah,
I'm sure it will.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.338
Really?

22:44.274 --> 22:45.441
Yes.

22:45.509 --> 22:46.776
Thanks.

22:46.844 --> 22:47.877
Thank you.

22:49.046 --> 22:50.479
- Call me when it's done.
- Yup.

22:50.547 --> 22:51.581
No rush.

23:07.484 --> 23:09.018
When I was a young father,

23:09.086 --> 23:11.454
I didn't spend nearly
as much time with my daughter

23:11.521 --> 23:13.222
as I should have.

23:13.290 --> 23:15.124
Yeah, I'm the
same way with my dad.

23:15.192 --> 23:17.327
Pretty much part
of the deal now, though.

23:17.394 --> 23:20.663
Yeah, definitely a change
for the better.

23:20.730 --> 23:25.200
You know that you,
and Lou, and Katie,

23:25.268 --> 23:27.970
are free to stay here
as long as you want.

23:28.037 --> 23:30.238
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

23:30.306 --> 23:31.873
And, you know,
thank you for that.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.343
And you're aware
of the fact that...

23:34.410 --> 23:35.610
Well, right now is
a pretty busy time

23:35.678 --> 23:37.644
at the dude ranch.

23:37.712 --> 23:40.014
What are you...
What're you getting at, Jack?

23:40.082 --> 23:42.483
Well, I just want you
to know

23:42.550 --> 23:45.019
that you're welcome
to stay here

23:45.087 --> 23:47.188
if you stop work
on that new house

23:47.255 --> 23:48.789
for the time being.

23:48.857 --> 23:50.992
Well, you know, that's...
That's not gonna happen.

23:51.059 --> 23:53.126
'Cause if we stop now,

23:53.194 --> 23:55.495
then nothing's gonna happen
until spring, you know.

23:55.562 --> 23:57.930
And I know that
you need your space, right?

23:57.999 --> 23:59.699
I mean, I helped you build
that outhouse.

23:59.766 --> 24:01.201
There's lots
of worse things

24:01.268 --> 24:05.071
than slogging to an outhouse
in the snow.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.473
Getting caught between
Lou and Lisa

24:06.540 --> 24:07.907
might be one of them.

24:08.975 --> 24:09.975
Right.

24:10.043 --> 24:11.776
You know, that dude ranch
was Lou's dream,

24:11.844 --> 24:14.279
and now that Lisa's
involved,

24:14.347 --> 24:16.281
well, let's just say

24:16.349 --> 24:18.717
I'm hoping that
a modern guy like you

24:18.784 --> 24:23.455
might deal with the situation
a little bit better than me.

24:23.523 --> 24:25.156
There you go.

24:25.224 --> 24:28.059
I think she needs
changing, dad.

24:31.997 --> 24:34.365
Okay, you ready? Come on!

24:34.433 --> 24:36.000
Okay,
I'll help you hold the goat.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.069
Come on!

24:39.471 --> 24:40.738
Come on!
You can get it!

24:41.972 --> 24:44.207
Go on! Pull it!

24:44.275 --> 24:45.808
Oh yeah!
'Kay, come on, come on!

24:45.876 --> 24:47.310
Get back on your horse!

24:50.481 --> 24:51.748
All right, everybody.

24:51.815 --> 24:53.417
Who wants to go next,
huh?

24:53.484 --> 24:54.884
Me! Me! Me!

24:54.952 --> 24:57.286
This is definitely
Little Britches.

24:57.354 --> 24:58.987
I'm looking for Tim Fleming.

24:59.056 --> 25:01.123
I'm sorry. My dad's running
a little bit late.

25:01.191 --> 25:02.624
Okay, well,
could you just tell him

25:02.692 --> 25:04.293
that my editor
green lit the piece.

25:04.361 --> 25:05.861
Okay.

25:05.929 --> 25:08.197
Wait... your dad?

25:08.265 --> 25:10.066
I thought I recognized you.
You're Amy Fleming -

25:10.133 --> 25:12.468
the miracle girl,
Ring of Fire...

25:12.536 --> 25:13.734
<i>I'm Nadir Jutley.</i>

25:13.802 --> 25:15.670
I'm a reporter
with the Hudson Times.

25:15.737 --> 25:17.105
Um, I'm sorry,

25:17.173 --> 25:18.706
my dad's just been so busy
with this election.

25:18.774 --> 25:21.376
You know, this whole cowboy
association thing?

25:21.444 --> 25:23.010
Besides Stumpy's barbecues,

25:23.079 --> 25:24.912
I don't know if the readers
are really interested in it.

25:24.980 --> 25:27.449
Well, my dad was
a pretty big rodeo star.

25:27.516 --> 25:29.050
Really...

25:29.117 --> 25:30.884
Well, do you think maybe
I could ask you

25:30.952 --> 25:32.919
some questions about him
while we wait?

25:32.987 --> 25:34.354
Sure.
We're almost done here.

25:34.422 --> 25:35.522
Okay. Great!

25:35.590 --> 25:37.524
So how about we all
come over here

25:37.592 --> 25:38.725
a little closer,

25:38.793 --> 25:40.461
so we can get a picture
with the goat?

25:40.528 --> 25:42.963
Okay, come on in.
Little ones to the front.

25:43.898 --> 25:45.931
Okay, just a little closer.

26:05.218 --> 26:06.851
So you've been on
the cover of magazines,

26:06.919 --> 26:09.221
you won the Ring of Fire
competition,

26:09.288 --> 26:11.022
you worked
with chase powers...

26:11.090 --> 26:12.924
So why Little Britches?

26:12.992 --> 26:14.559
I'm really just filling in
for my dad.

26:14.627 --> 26:17.394
It was his idea to volunteer
and help these little kids.

26:17.462 --> 26:19.796
And my dad
just really loves

26:19.864 --> 26:21.098
helping other people,
you know?

26:21.166 --> 26:22.566
That's why he got involved

26:22.634 --> 26:24.335
with this cowboy association
election-

26:25.903 --> 26:27.271
Just a second.

26:28.206 --> 26:30.474
Hey.

26:30.542 --> 26:32.075
Uh, yeah.
I'm leaving right now.

26:32.144 --> 26:33.943
I'll meet you up
on the ridge?

26:34.011 --> 26:35.478
Okay, bye.

26:35.546 --> 26:36.812
Sorry about that.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.981
My dad, I don't know why
he didn't show up.

26:39.049 --> 26:41.417
This election means
a lot to him.

26:41.485 --> 26:42.585
It's okay, Amy.

26:42.653 --> 26:43.653
I have a deadline
to meet anyway.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.188
Thank you so much
for your help.

26:45.256 --> 26:47.157
All right.
See ya.

27:19.921 --> 27:21.088
Ty! Look out!

27:40.540 --> 27:42.308
Hey, I've been waiting
a while.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.476
I hope everything's okay.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.167
Hey.

28:11.236 --> 28:12.436
Hey.

28:12.503 --> 28:14.304
I was worried.
I thought...

28:14.372 --> 28:15.639
Maybe something had happened,

28:15.707 --> 28:18.275
like you got in
another accident, or...

28:18.343 --> 28:19.976
No. Just...

28:20.044 --> 28:22.145
Having some trouble
with the throttle.

28:22.213 --> 28:24.648
I'm working on it now though.

28:36.025 --> 28:37.360
Is everything okay,
Grandpa?

28:37.427 --> 28:39.161
Oh, yeah.

28:39.229 --> 28:40.529
Everything will be
a whole lot better

28:40.597 --> 28:42.430
when this stupid
election's over.

28:42.498 --> 28:44.232
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

28:44.300 --> 28:48.002
Hey, can I ask your help
with something?

28:48.070 --> 28:49.704
You were with Ty
when he had that accident,

28:49.772 --> 28:51.439
so you know how big
of a deal it is

28:51.507 --> 28:53.541
for him to get back
on that bike.

28:53.609 --> 28:56.344
I thought you hated
the whole Ty motorcycle thing?

28:56.412 --> 28:58.779
I don't hate it,
it just...

28:58.846 --> 29:00.914
I don't know,
it scares me.

29:00.982 --> 29:02.583
And that's why I can't
talk to him about it.

29:02.651 --> 29:05.486
But I figure that
you can.

29:05.553 --> 29:08.889
You know that changing the way
Ty feels about motorcycles

29:08.956 --> 29:12.593
is about as easy as changing
the way you feel about horses.

29:12.661 --> 29:14.560
No. I don't want
to change him.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.529
He just...
He keeps fixing that bike.

29:16.597 --> 29:18.564
He needs to get
back on it.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.266
And I know he wants to,

29:20.334 --> 29:22.201
but he keeps finding
one more thing to fix

29:22.269 --> 29:23.770
when there's nothing left.

29:23.837 --> 29:25.204
Well, everybody
knows you gotta...

29:25.272 --> 29:26.773
Get back on the horse
that threw you.

29:27.841 --> 29:29.574
Hey, Dad!

29:29.642 --> 29:30.575
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.411
Amy!

29:32.478 --> 29:34.179
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

29:34.246 --> 29:35.614
What are you talking about?

29:35.682 --> 29:37.816
"Mutton busting
with Miracle Girl."

29:37.883 --> 29:39.250
Oh my God.
I don't believe it!

29:39.419 --> 29:40.619
Yeah, neither do I!

29:40.687 --> 29:41.820
That's a nice picture.

29:41.887 --> 29:43.021
Yeah, nice.

29:43.088 --> 29:44.389
Be nice if Amy was running
for election

29:44.457 --> 29:46.256
and she had a picture
on the cover of the Times;

29:46.325 --> 29:47.625
That would help her out.

29:47.693 --> 29:49.293
The reporter was looking
for you,

29:49.361 --> 29:51.094
but I had to cover because,
of course, you weren't there.

29:51.162 --> 29:52.229
This is no joke!

29:52.297 --> 29:53.564
It makes me look
like a fake!

29:53.632 --> 29:55.766
You are a fake.
I was doing your job for you!

29:55.834 --> 29:58.168
I told everybody that
I was running Little Britches-

29:58.236 --> 30:00.037
Oh, well,
good news, Dad.

30:00.104 --> 30:02.104
You can run it for real now
because I quit!

30:03.106 --> 30:04.307
You... you...

30:06.977 --> 30:08.010
Mm-hmm.

30:34.015 --> 30:36.149
We're not open yet!

30:36.217 --> 30:38.886
Just a sec.

30:41.488 --> 30:42.589
Hi, Lisa.

30:42.656 --> 30:43.990
We don't start
for another 15 minutes.

30:44.058 --> 30:45.758
Oh, I'm not here
as a customer.

30:45.826 --> 30:46.993
I'm here to volunteer.

30:47.061 --> 30:48.360
Oh! Well,
as you can see,

30:48.428 --> 30:50.362
we pretty well have things
under control.

30:50.430 --> 30:51.397
Well, it looks like
you could use

30:51.465 --> 30:53.066
a little bit of a hand.

30:53.133 --> 30:54.901
And I was thinking

30:54.969 --> 30:57.069
if we found a moment
between flipping pancakes,

30:57.136 --> 30:58.804
we could perhaps
have a little chat

30:58.871 --> 31:00.538
about our business -

31:00.607 --> 31:02.874
Your dude ranch.

31:03.810 --> 31:06.078
What the heck.

31:07.179 --> 31:08.546
Here, grab an apron.

31:08.615 --> 31:09.881
Thank you.

31:17.155 --> 31:19.456
Hey, Jack.
Amy around?

31:19.524 --> 31:20.625
Uh, no.

31:20.692 --> 31:21.759
Said she'd be gone
all morning.

31:21.827 --> 31:23.293
Will you look at that?

31:23.361 --> 31:25.796
I haven't seen some of those
old codgers in years.

31:25.864 --> 31:26.897
Yeah,
I just picked 'em up

31:26.965 --> 31:28.598
at the Crossroads
Retirement Home.

31:28.666 --> 31:29.866
You know, they really
appreciate a chance

31:29.934 --> 31:31.034
to get out and mingle,

31:31.102 --> 31:32.435
and enjoy
a pancake breakfast.

31:32.503 --> 31:34.303
And vote for Tim.

31:34.371 --> 31:35.939
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jack!

31:36.007 --> 31:37.874
Hey! Knows ya.

31:39.342 --> 31:40.409
Well, you know,
these old timers

31:40.477 --> 31:43.179
are a big part
of my electoral base.

31:43.247 --> 31:44.747
Speaking of which,
I should probably get going.

31:44.814 --> 31:47.082
I got a couple more guys
to pick up on the way.

31:47.150 --> 31:48.851
You are unbelievable.

31:48.918 --> 31:51.419
Oh, I'm just doing
what I can, huh?

31:51.487 --> 31:53.622
Hey, nothing beats
the feeling of knowing

31:53.690 --> 31:56.391
that you're not doing it
for yourself,

31:56.459 --> 31:58.794
you're doing it
to the other guy.

32:06.268 --> 32:07.301
So that's everything.

32:07.369 --> 32:08.469
Mm-hmm.

32:10.105 --> 32:11.139
Coffee?

32:13.208 --> 32:15.576
I'm sorry things have gotten
so out of hand, Lisa.

32:15.644 --> 32:17.110
I didn't realize
this would have

32:17.178 --> 32:18.879
such a big impact
on the business.

32:18.946 --> 32:20.613
I'm here because
I don't want to fight

32:20.682 --> 32:22.482
through our men any more.

32:22.550 --> 32:25.052
I know. This is our
relationship, our business.

32:25.119 --> 32:27.187
It's important to me.

32:27.254 --> 32:29.556
So you had a vision
with the dude ranch.

32:29.623 --> 32:32.758
It was your baby then,
and you have a real baby now.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.761
Yes, I have a baby,
and I have job,

32:35.829 --> 32:37.462
so I'm not as involved
in the day to day,

32:37.530 --> 32:38.698
as you are.

32:38.765 --> 32:40.733
But, Lisa, I still
really, really care

32:40.801 --> 32:42.034
about the dude ranch.

32:42.102 --> 32:43.268
I know you do,
and I'm fine with everything.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.604
Except right now
there's a conflict of interest

32:45.672 --> 32:47.539
and only you can
solve it.

32:47.607 --> 32:50.041
Lisa, I never realized
how big

32:50.109 --> 32:51.509
that damn hole
was gonna be.

32:51.577 --> 32:53.111
And yes, I had a vision.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.512
And no,

32:54.580 --> 32:56.181
I don't think that
that house is part of it,

32:56.248 --> 32:58.917
but what was I supposed
to tell Peter?

32:58.984 --> 33:00.518
He chose that site.

33:00.586 --> 33:02.420
He hired the contractor,
he worked with the architect.

33:02.487 --> 33:04.554
He was so excited.

33:04.622 --> 33:07.490
And you know what?
He needed something

33:07.558 --> 33:08.859
and I didn't wanna
take that away from him.

33:08.927 --> 33:12.029
And I still don't wanna
spoil that for him.

33:12.097 --> 33:14.497
Well, I don't think you're
spoiling anything for him.

33:14.565 --> 33:16.433
He called me this morning,
told me where you were,

33:16.500 --> 33:17.667
wanted me to talk to you.

33:17.736 --> 33:19.002
About what?

33:19.070 --> 33:21.137
About postponing
till the spring.

33:21.205 --> 33:23.206
Wait, wait...
He's okay with that?

33:23.273 --> 33:25.307
Oh... uh! Mm-mm.

33:27.077 --> 33:29.979
Your husband,
you talk to him.

33:40.689 --> 33:42.157
Hey, Jack.

33:42.225 --> 33:43.458
What's up with the bike?

33:43.525 --> 33:45.293
Well, I thought maybe

33:45.361 --> 33:47.428
after you were done working
on your Norton,

33:47.496 --> 33:49.765
you might give this one a go.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.266
Well, I still got a lot
to do on mine

33:52.333 --> 33:54.001
before I get it
back on the road.

33:54.069 --> 33:56.370
Well, it looks like you done
a great job so far.

33:56.437 --> 33:57.938
Yeah. There's still a problem
with the front brakes.

33:58.006 --> 34:00.908
And the forks are
out of whack, so...

34:00.976 --> 34:03.210
You know, Ty,

34:03.278 --> 34:05.712
I don't know how you feel
about that accident we had,

34:06.781 --> 34:07.748
but I gotta admit,

34:07.815 --> 34:09.415
I was pretty shook up there
for a bit

34:09.483 --> 34:11.583
and I got off
a lot luckier than you.

34:11.652 --> 34:12.752
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Jack,

34:12.820 --> 34:14.987
but honestly,
it's no big deal.

34:15.054 --> 34:15.889
I just wanna get it
running properly

34:15.956 --> 34:17.956
and I'll be fine.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.393
Oh, by the way,

34:20.460 --> 34:23.362
Amy said she was taking
Spartan for a ride.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.697
Figured she'd be up
at the ridge about noon.

34:26.933 --> 34:28.333
Uh, like I said,
I got a lot of work to do

34:28.400 --> 34:29.634
on that Norton.

34:30.603 --> 34:33.237
Well, no pressure.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.784
Yeah!

34:47.719 --> 34:48.820
Okay, fellas, come on!

34:48.887 --> 34:50.754
Right in here,
right this way.

34:51.889 --> 34:52.956
Hi.

34:53.025 --> 34:54.091
Okay, step right on in.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.293
Hello.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.726
The gals will
take care of you.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.661
The gals?
Seriously?

34:58.729 --> 34:59.762
That's it!

35:01.699 --> 35:02.999
What's going on?

35:03.067 --> 35:04.835
It's like eleven o'clock.
There's nobody here.

35:04.902 --> 35:06.602
Hey! Hi! There.
Here you go.

35:06.670 --> 35:07.904
I don't know, Dad.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.772
But we have enough pancakes
to feed an army,

35:09.841 --> 35:12.875
so whenever the rush hits,
we'll be ready. Hi!

35:12.943 --> 35:14.710
Yeah, well, those pancakes
cost me a fortune.

35:14.777 --> 35:18.848
If we don't eat them all,
we're taking them home.

35:49.043 --> 35:51.078
Okay.
Hey!

35:52.413 --> 35:53.680
Glad I beat the rush.

35:53.748 --> 35:55.682
There you go,
one tall stack.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.485
And there is plenty more
if you want seconds.

35:59.653 --> 36:01.120
Or thirds.

36:01.188 --> 36:03.422
Thanks, Lou.

36:03.490 --> 36:04.690
Okay.

36:04.758 --> 36:08.127
Can I have everyone's attention,
please?

36:08.195 --> 36:09.495
Everyone, quiet!

36:10.463 --> 36:12.298
Thank you.

36:12.366 --> 36:15.467
So it is 11:45.

36:15.535 --> 36:16.968
<i>A few more minutes
before the polls close,</i>

36:17.036 --> 36:19.871
we're coming down
to the crunch.

36:19.939 --> 36:22.908
So is there anyone
that has not voted?

36:23.876 --> 36:26.711
Or does anybody know a member
of the cowboy association

36:26.779 --> 36:28.679
<i>who has not voted?</i>

36:30.215 --> 36:31.516
Voted for what?

36:37.723 --> 36:38.989
Okay, right down there!

36:39.057 --> 36:40.990
Run! Run!

36:41.058 --> 36:42.258
Hey!

36:42.326 --> 36:43.927
Wait! I still have time to vote,
right?

36:45.029 --> 36:46.329
Thank you.

36:54.939 --> 36:57.673
Well, it looks like
we've been stood up again.

36:57.741 --> 36:58.874
Come on.

37:46.553 --> 37:48.521
Howdy, stranger.

37:48.589 --> 37:49.789
Can I get you anything?

37:49.857 --> 37:53.292
For starters,
you can accept my apology.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.694
I think I will.

37:54.761 --> 37:56.529
Peter tells me
you went to bat for me.

37:56.597 --> 37:57.964
He did, did he?

37:58.031 --> 38:00.098
Yes, he did.
So I'm grateful.

38:00.165 --> 38:01.432
How about a cup of coffee

38:01.501 --> 38:03.434
and a stack of pancakes
on the house?

38:03.503 --> 38:05.236
Hey, Jack. Great timing.

38:06.338 --> 38:08.339
They're still
counting votes.

38:08.407 --> 38:11.142
Oh, I wanted you
to see this.

38:11.210 --> 38:12.644
And what am I
looking at here?

38:12.712 --> 38:14.980
My press release.
Here.

38:16.347 --> 38:17.314
I've had some pretty
high highs

38:17.382 --> 38:18.682
and some pretty low lows,

38:18.750 --> 38:20.518
but, in the end,
when it really mattered,

38:20.585 --> 38:21.952
I came out on top,

38:22.020 --> 38:24.121
even when the odds
were stacked against me...

38:24.188 --> 38:26.524
I wrote that last year
for the hall of fame.

38:26.591 --> 38:28.291
Yeah, okay,
I used a bit.

38:28.359 --> 38:31.228
Not all of it.
Seventy percent.

38:31.295 --> 38:32.629
So now I'm your
speech writer?

38:32.696 --> 38:33.696
Hold the thought.

38:35.232 --> 38:37.400
Hello, Maggie's Diner.

38:37.467 --> 38:40.102
Yeah, Tim Fleming
is right here.

38:40.170 --> 38:42.805
Really! Close!
Wow!

38:43.741 --> 38:45.474
Yeah, it's Tim.

38:45.543 --> 38:48.043
Yeah, close. Yeah.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.845
What?!

38:49.913 --> 38:52.648
Close enough
for a recount?

38:53.583 --> 38:55.350
Close but no cigar.

38:55.418 --> 38:56.552
No. No. Thanks.
Yeah.

38:56.619 --> 38:59.054
Thanks, I got it.

39:02.091 --> 39:03.691
Well, I guess
that's what happens

39:03.759 --> 39:08.930
when one man tries to stand up
against the Stumpy machine.

39:09.898 --> 39:11.032
Okay, this thing is over,
folks.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.600
Okay, no more pancakes,
no more coffee!

39:12.668 --> 39:14.101
That's it, wrap it up.
Let's go.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.705
I'm sorry, Jack.

39:17.773 --> 39:20.006
I guess you're not gonna be
in the hall of fame this year.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.009
Maybe next year.

39:23.077 --> 39:25.411
Next year, you can write
your own press release too.

39:26.914 --> 39:28.247
Yeah,
I probably should.

39:28.315 --> 39:31.250
Maybe I'll have a chance
of winning!

39:37.518 --> 39:39.618
I knew I'd find you here!

39:40.987 --> 39:42.421
I knew you couldn't quit
on these kids.

39:42.489 --> 39:43.522
I didn't quit
on the kids, Dad.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.123
I quit on you.

39:45.191 --> 39:46.725
Well, you're not the first
person to say that.

39:46.793 --> 39:48.160
I got a call
from the guy at Little Britches

39:48.227 --> 39:49.895
after he saw the picture
in the paper.

39:49.962 --> 39:51.963
Said he wouldn't be needing
my services any more.

39:52.031 --> 39:53.465
You blame him?

39:53.533 --> 39:54.799
I mean,
what was the point?

39:54.866 --> 39:56.434
Little Britches?
Running for president?

39:56.502 --> 39:58.035
There's gotta be
easier ways.

39:58.103 --> 39:59.570
Well,
I suppose there is.

39:59.638 --> 40:00.838
But you know...

40:00.906 --> 40:02.607
Another guy might have
picked an easier way.

40:02.675 --> 40:04.542
Oh, come on, Dad,
the election is over.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.945
I just wanted you and Lou
to be proud of me.

40:08.013 --> 40:09.447
We are proud of you.

40:09.515 --> 40:11.114
But I thought this was
supposed to be about Shane,

40:11.182 --> 40:12.582
not whether
you're a better person

40:12.650 --> 40:13.617
than his mom is.

40:13.685 --> 40:14.685
Once lawyers are involved,

40:14.752 --> 40:16.420
that's exactly
what it's about.

40:16.487 --> 40:17.987
No.
No, it shouldn't be.

40:18.055 --> 40:20.691
It should be about
what Shane wants, period.

40:20.758 --> 40:23.226
No matter how many
elections you run in,

40:23.294 --> 40:24.761
or parades you ride in,

40:24.829 --> 40:26.629
it's still gonna be about
his decision in the end.

40:26.697 --> 40:28.997
Life's not that simple,
Amy.

40:29.065 --> 40:30.599
Maybe it is.

40:39.008 --> 40:40.209
So you're sure about this?

40:40.276 --> 40:41.677
Yeah.

40:41.745 --> 40:43.144
You're good to
wait until spring?

40:43.212 --> 40:45.714
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking,

40:45.781 --> 40:48.015
why even wait
till spring?

40:48.083 --> 40:49.951
Why don't we just buy
a house?

40:50.018 --> 40:52.086
Are you serious?
Buy a house?

40:52.154 --> 40:55.457
Yeah. I mean,
timing's right.

40:55.524 --> 40:56.558
We're both working.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.359
We can make
the down payment.

40:58.426 --> 41:00.126
All we have to do
is find the right place.

41:00.194 --> 41:04.365
I thought, according to you,
this was the right place.

41:04.432 --> 41:06.367
Yeah, well,
so did I.

41:06.434 --> 41:08.969
But things have changed.

41:10.605 --> 41:13.273
Yeah,
I guess they have.

41:18.011 --> 41:19.078
Thank you.

41:22.750 --> 41:25.518
You wanna...
You wanna tell him?

41:25.586 --> 41:26.753
Yeah?

41:26.820 --> 41:28.954
Got for it, honey.
Do what you gotta do.

41:36.629 --> 41:39.130
Hey! Hold up! Hold up!
Stop!

41:41.300 --> 41:43.468
I gotta talk to you, guys.

41:45.037 --> 41:47.137
I'm really glad
Lou changed her mind.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.672
I know I wasn't supposed
to take it personally,

41:48.740 --> 41:50.808
but it's hard,
I'm not a member of the family-

41:50.876 --> 41:53.744
Now, hold on, Lisa.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.747
Maybe I don't say this
as much as I should.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.316
But as far as I'm concerned,

41:59.384 --> 42:01.485
you're as much a part
of this family

42:01.553 --> 42:02.952
as anybody could be.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.153
Mm-hm.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.488
You mean,
without being married.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.926
I'm not angling
for a proposal.

42:09.993 --> 42:11.694
I know better than that.

42:11.762 --> 42:15.231
Some things are best just left
the way they are, right?

42:15.299 --> 42:16.966
Exactly what I was
thinking.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.434
Mm-hmm.

42:18.501 --> 42:19.902
I'm sure you were.

42:20.970 --> 42:22.003
Lead on.

42:27.744 --> 42:30.045
Hey, Caleb.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.513
I just wanted to thank you
for your vote.

42:31.581 --> 42:32.981
Better late than never.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.016
I didn't vote for you,
Tim.

42:36.084 --> 42:37.885
What?

42:37.953 --> 42:39.019
What,
after all those pancakes?

42:39.087 --> 42:40.120
Are you kidding me?!

42:40.188 --> 42:41.456
I like pancakes
and all,

42:41.523 --> 42:42.924
but you just don't beat
Stumpy's barbecue.

42:42.991 --> 42:44.358
I mean...

42:45.360 --> 42:47.528
Yeah, I kinda hate
to miss it myself.

42:47.596 --> 42:50.364
Well, did you wanna go?

42:50.432 --> 42:54.634
Well, show my support,
shake Stumpy's hand,

42:54.702 --> 42:56.402
eat some ribs?
Yeah, why not?

42:56.471 --> 42:57.938
He'd appreciate it.

42:58.005 --> 42:59.305
Hey, hey...

43:00.240 --> 43:02.041
I'm sorry to hear
about your marriage.

43:02.109 --> 43:07.380
Yeah. Me too.
But uh...

43:07.448 --> 43:09.715
I really hoped
it was gonna work out.

43:09.783 --> 43:11.017
I mean, rodeo's
all good and fine,

43:11.085 --> 43:13.252
but working towards
that dream without a woman,

43:13.320 --> 43:15.787
it kinda seems pointless.

43:15.855 --> 43:17.122
Do you ever listen
to yourself?

43:17.190 --> 43:18.790
Well, I tend to fade in
and out.

43:18.858 --> 43:20.492
I mean, 'cause sometimes
you make no sense.

43:20.559 --> 43:21.826
Let's go.

43:26.765 --> 43:28.367
Hey!

43:28.434 --> 43:29.401
First time, you got it going!
Good for you!

43:29.469 --> 43:31.302
Okay, clutch in.

43:31.370 --> 43:33.204
<i>Good. Good.
Now click it into first.</i>

43:34.172 --> 43:36.640
All right, now... gas,

43:36.708 --> 43:38.709
and slowly let out
on the clutch.

43:38.776 --> 43:40.311
- Okay.
- Okay, slowly.

43:40.379 --> 43:41.812
Not so much gas-

43:41.880 --> 43:42.779
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't!

43:42.847 --> 43:43.814
It's okay.
It's okay.

43:43.882 --> 43:45.483
You got it.
You're gettin' it!

43:45.550 --> 43:46.983
Okay. Ready?

43:47.051 --> 43:48.051
Yeah.

43:48.119 --> 43:49.185
There you go!

43:49.253 --> 43:50.586
- All right.
- Okay.

43:50.654 --> 43:52.322
- - Okay, clutch in.    - Okay.
- Clutch in first.

43:52.390 --> 43:53.789
- Into first.
- Okay.

43:53.857 --> 43:55.358
Just feather the clutch.
There you go.

43:55.426 --> 43:56.393
There you go.
There you go.

43:56.460 --> 43:57.527
Good. Good.

43:57.594 --> 43:58.961
Okay.

43:59.030 --> 43:59.662
There you go. Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

43:59.730 --> 44:01.064

44:01.132 --> 44:02.097
