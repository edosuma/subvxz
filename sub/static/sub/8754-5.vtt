00:10.852 --> 00:14.094
They scare the people.
They scare them so bad.

00:14.727 --> 00:16.696
Activity has spiked here.

00:16.698 --> 00:18.202
It's higher than it's been in a long time.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.949
They're trapped.

00:20.951 --> 00:23.090
Now they're gonna be tortured.

00:23.092 --> 00:24.364
What was her cause of death?

00:24.366 --> 00:26.403
One gunshot wound through
the base of the skull.

00:26.405 --> 00:29.278
I feel like hurting people.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.688
I want you to find out who killed Mary Jane.

00:32.689 --> 00:35.897
People have done very bad things

00:35.899 --> 00:38.943
after they've left this place.

00:38.945 --> 00:41.615
Something bad's going to happen.

00:41.617 --> 00:44.519
My name is Amy Allan.

00:44.521 --> 00:45.887
There's panic.

00:45.889 --> 00:47.322
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:47.324 --> 00:48.397
I see dead people.

00:48.399 --> 00:50.538
They all died horribly.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.243
I speak to dead people.

00:52.245 --> 00:53.654
Get out of here.

00:53.656 --> 00:55.289
And they speak to me.

00:55.291 --> 00:57.325
Vicious.

00:57.327 --> 01:00.470
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:00.472 --> 01:02.172
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

01:02.174 --> 01:03.740
I rely on my partner.

01:03.742 --> 01:05.375
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:05.376 --> 01:07.278
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.983
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.659
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:12.661 --> 01:14.162
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:14.164 --> 01:15.332
It's my job to reveal them.

01:15.334 --> 01:17.605
This is not good.

01:17.607 --> 01:19.343
But Steve and I never speak...

01:19.345 --> 01:21.381
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:21.383 --> 01:23.149
Until the very end...

01:23.151 --> 01:24.619
I want my life back.

01:24.621 --> 01:26.857
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:26.859 --> 01:28.661
Is he trying to kill her?

01:28.663 --> 01:29.930
Or time to get out.

01:29.932 --> 01:31.435
Oh, my God.

01:31.437 --> 01:33.140
This is going to kill us.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

01:46.141 --> 01:50.980
I'm in Oregon, Illinois,
about 100 miles west of Chicago.

01:50.982 --> 01:53.352
I got a call from a former mayor of the town

01:53.354 --> 01:54.856
who owns a restaurant there.

01:54.858 --> 01:56.692
He told me his place is haunted,

01:56.694 --> 01:59.264
and that his employees
and customers are scared,

01:59.266 --> 02:01.403
but that's not what caught my attention

02:01.405 --> 02:02.638
about this case.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.876
He thinks the place is being haunted

02:04.878 --> 02:07.881
by an unsolved murder that
happened many years ago.

02:07.883 --> 02:09.648
Now, I'm not sure about all that,

02:09.650 --> 02:11.384
but he sounded pretty desperate,

02:11.386 --> 02:13.254
and I'm hoping we can help him out.

02:19.532 --> 02:21.203
Before Amy arrives,

02:21.205 --> 02:23.340
I need to make sure photos, paintings,

02:23.342 --> 02:26.077
and anything else that
could influence her findings

02:26.079 --> 02:27.713
are covered or removed.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.013
When I'm finished,

02:29.015 --> 02:32.085
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.930
Okay.

02:48.172 --> 02:50.105
Mm.

02:50.107 --> 02:52.275
This place makes you feel

02:52.277 --> 02:57.249
like someone's just come up
and punched you in the stomach.

02:58.118 --> 03:02.358
You know, like,
you're getting the air knocked out of you,

03:02.360 --> 03:04.394
and you want to just vomit.

03:04.396 --> 03:11.733
That's kind of how it feels here.

03:11.735 --> 03:14.202
I would just get out of here, you know?

03:14.204 --> 03:17.270
There's no hope here.

03:26.508 --> 03:29.178
So, Mike,
one of the things we spoke about on the phone

03:29.180 --> 03:31.816
was how intense the activity
has gotten in this place.

03:31.818 --> 03:34.517
Give me a rundown what the hell's going on.

03:34.519 --> 03:36.954
Noises, things flying across the room,

03:36.956 --> 03:40.624
shadow figures, people being touched.

03:40.626 --> 03:42.992
We've had customers
actually get up and leave.

03:42.994 --> 03:45.127
Okay, are you losing business, you think,

03:45.129 --> 03:47.498
because of some of this
stuff that's going on?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.266
Of course, it's gone down.

03:49.268 --> 03:51.168
It's not what it used to be.

03:51.170 --> 03:53.269
- I understand you're a former mayor.
- Correct.

03:53.271 --> 03:55.072
What year was that?

03:55.074 --> 03:58.045
That was from 1999 to 2003.

03:58.047 --> 04:00.146
When did you buy this place?

04:00.148 --> 04:03.982
I bought the place in 1993.

04:03.984 --> 04:06.051
Okay, so was it a bar and restaurant

04:06.053 --> 04:07.152
when you bought it?

04:07.154 --> 04:08.787
No, it was in a shambles.

04:08.789 --> 04:11.420
Matter of fact,
here's a picture of the place.

04:11.422 --> 04:13.021
It was condemned.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.760
So, you have this place over 20 years.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.526
Why are you calling us now?

04:18.528 --> 04:19.992
Activity has spiked here.

04:19.994 --> 04:22.494
It's higher than it's been in a long time.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.062
Did anything change?

04:24.064 --> 04:25.895
I moved in here a few years ago, okay,

04:25.897 --> 04:27.995
and I guess I've just
become more aware of it

04:27.997 --> 04:32.867
being here 24/7 instead
of just 10 hours a day.

04:32.869 --> 04:35.302
You mentioned that you have a theory

04:35.304 --> 04:37.903
about who you think is haunting this place.

04:37.905 --> 04:39.571
It dates back to 1948.

04:39.573 --> 04:41.106
Mary Jane Reed and her date.

04:41.108 --> 04:42.976
They spent their last night alive

04:42.978 --> 04:43.978
in this building.

04:45.447 --> 04:48.245
- This is Mary Jane Reed?
- Correct.

04:51.855 --> 04:54.521
I made it my mission to solve this murder.

04:54.523 --> 04:57.432
Is there a cold case unit
working on this currently?

04:57.457 --> 04:58.183
No.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.631
You're the cold case unit working on it?

05:01.633 --> 05:03.232
I had the gal's body exhumed.

05:04.901 --> 05:08.838
I've dropped probably $150,000 on it

05:08.840 --> 05:11.272
over the past 15 years.

05:11.274 --> 05:13.107
On looking into this case?

05:13.109 --> 05:14.843
Correct.

05:14.845 --> 05:18.143
I mean, is that part of the
reason you're living here now?

05:18.145 --> 05:19.746
It's the reason I don't
have a house anymore.

05:19.748 --> 05:21.182
I'm living here, yes.

05:21.184 --> 05:23.015
Why are you spending this
kind of money on a case

05:23.017 --> 05:24.346
that's got nothing to do with you?

05:24.348 --> 05:27.249
Because the family needs closure.

05:27.251 --> 05:29.983
Her spirit needs closure.

05:29.985 --> 05:32.714
So, Mike, I got to ask you,
what makes you think

05:32.716 --> 05:35.483
that it's Mary Jane Reed that's here?

05:35.485 --> 05:37.616
If I'm not doing anything,

05:37.618 --> 05:40.586
or if I'm letting my efforts slide,

05:40.588 --> 05:43.653
the paranormal activity here spikes.

05:43.655 --> 05:45.088
I can't let it go.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.624
So,
I've got a client who's so positive

05:47.626 --> 05:49.760
he knows who's haunting his property,

05:49.762 --> 05:51.761
he's literally spent his life savings

05:51.763 --> 05:52.994
trying to solve a crime

05:52.996 --> 05:55.395
he thinks will put the
victim's spirit to rest.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.496
He's even had one of the victims' bodies

05:57.498 --> 05:59.498
exhumed and re-examined by a coroner,

05:59.500 --> 06:02.499
and trust me,
that's no easy thing to have done.

06:02.501 --> 06:04.969
This case is gonna be an unusual one.

06:08.045 --> 06:09.844
There's a woman.

06:09.846 --> 06:14.349
She looks young, maybe 20s.

06:14.351 --> 06:18.251
Really... nasty.

06:19.218 --> 06:21.421
She is something.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.591
Very physical, very solid.

06:23.593 --> 06:29.399
She can really do

06:29.401 --> 06:33.671
a lot of harm to people physically.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.311
I would assume that people would see her.

06:37.313 --> 06:41.351
She likes to sit by people.
That's a big thing for her.

06:41.353 --> 06:43.487
But it's very unnerving.

06:43.489 --> 06:46.859
She's just wicked.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.899
What's going on in this area here?

06:54.901 --> 06:57.569
Well, it was in the lounge area

06:57.571 --> 07:00.671
that I saw this apparition
of this young girl.

07:03.009 --> 07:04.642
That was like the third time

07:04.644 --> 07:06.477
that she'd been in the building.

07:06.479 --> 07:07.780
Saw her go out the front door.

07:07.782 --> 07:10.052
I was maybe seven seconds behind her,

07:10.054 --> 07:11.789
and by the time I got to the doorway

07:11.791 --> 07:14.024
and looked the other way, she was gone.

07:14.026 --> 07:16.561
You're sure it wasn't a real person, then?

07:16.563 --> 07:18.331
It sure looked like a real person to me,

07:18.333 --> 07:20.433
but how she disappeared
after she got out the door

07:20.435 --> 07:22.368
when I followed her out,
I don't have a clue.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.103
You think it's this girl, Mary Jane?

07:24.105 --> 07:26.371
I'm thinking that it almost had to be.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.439
Is there anything else you've seen?

07:28.441 --> 07:29.473
The shadows.

07:29.475 --> 07:31.942
You see them out of the corner of your eye,

07:31.944 --> 07:34.443
and you turn your head, and they're gone.

07:34.445 --> 07:35.645
There's no shadows.

07:35.647 --> 07:37.281
You think you see something,

07:37.283 --> 07:39.917
or you feel like you're being watched.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.485
Okay, now, there's a lot of people

07:41.487 --> 07:43.020
that are in and out of this place.

07:43.022 --> 07:44.689
Are you sure it's not being reflected

07:44.691 --> 07:46.291
by another person or living person?

07:46.293 --> 07:48.193
I don't typically see those when we're open.

07:48.195 --> 07:50.663
I mean,
if I thought that there was someone around,

07:50.665 --> 07:52.866
and that's what it was,
I wouldn't have even brought it up.

07:56.369 --> 08:00.873
There are these things
really just everywhere.

08:00.875 --> 08:05.613
I don't like being here because
I feel this is something

08:05.615 --> 08:09.115
that can affect the living very easily.

08:09.117 --> 08:10.985
Can you describe these things?

08:10.987 --> 08:12.924
They're three-dimensional.

08:12.926 --> 08:16.392
Living people see this dark thing

08:16.394 --> 08:18.361
standing in the doorway.

08:20.866 --> 08:24.737
A dark presence, but it's solid.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.939
Instead of seeing an open doorway,

08:26.941 --> 08:29.774
there's like a solid darkness.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.190
It's worse in here.

08:39.192 --> 08:43.894
It's so [bleep] bad.

08:45.029 --> 08:49.334
This place...

08:49.336 --> 08:51.034
just destroys.

08:54.973 --> 08:56.740
It's so dangerous.

08:56.742 --> 09:03.014
It's hard to focus on, really, anything.

09:05.851 --> 09:10.455
I... I don't understand
how these things came here.

09:10.457 --> 09:15.390
It has its roots in Satanism.

09:15.392 --> 09:19.994
It has to do with religion,

09:19.996 --> 09:23.432
but there's nothing religion can do to help.

09:23.434 --> 09:26.001
Do you know where it came from?

09:26.003 --> 09:29.307
Well, like, Hell, you know?

09:30.410 --> 09:31.812
They're from Hell.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.950
Something was off
when I started interviewing

09:46.952 --> 09:48.586
the employees of Mike's restaurant.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.123
Okay, what did you see?

09:51.125 --> 09:53.824
Maybe a black figure, I don't know.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.760
As I asked them about their experiences,

09:55.762 --> 09:58.229
I got the feeling they were
keeping something from me.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.163
There's something that creeps me out here

10:00.165 --> 10:01.798
that I cannot explain.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.033
Like what?

10:03.035 --> 10:04.734
Just all kinds of stuff.

10:04.736 --> 10:06.934
And with over 20 years in law enforcement,

10:06.936 --> 10:09.202
I know when I'm not getting a clear answer.

10:09.204 --> 10:10.803
How long did this last?

10:10.805 --> 10:13.140
I can't really tell you.

10:13.142 --> 10:15.711
You think whatever's here is good or bad?

10:15.713 --> 10:18.144
I... I have no idea.

10:18.146 --> 10:20.146
Finally, I had enough.

10:20.148 --> 10:22.417
It's a little frustrating,
I got to be honest with you.

10:22.419 --> 10:24.654
Sounds like something that you
guys discussed ahead of time

10:24.656 --> 10:26.057
how you were gonna answer things.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.130
When everybody I'm talking
to is that same way,

10:30.132 --> 10:32.633
it's a pattern, and it just, you know,

10:32.635 --> 10:35.202
tells me that something's not right here.

10:43.479 --> 10:44.947
Like, right now,

10:44.949 --> 10:48.884
it literally feels like
my mind is being erased.

10:50.687 --> 10:53.121
That's what happens to people here.

10:53.123 --> 10:54.756
They're trying to make it

10:54.758 --> 10:57.127
so like I can't figure things out.

10:57.129 --> 11:02.431
Those things... you know,
I'm not gonna call 'em demons

11:02.433 --> 11:06.100
'cause they're not demons.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.202
They said "legions."

11:08.204 --> 11:11.709
I don't know what that means.

11:11.711 --> 11:14.979
Something or someone
is trying to confuse me.

11:14.981 --> 11:17.815
I'm hearing that there are
legions of demons here,

11:17.817 --> 11:20.152
but that doesn't seem right.

11:20.154 --> 11:22.422
I feel like there are dead people here

11:22.424 --> 11:24.757
who want to talk to me, but they can't.

11:24.759 --> 11:27.995
I'm feeling them reaching out.

11:27.997 --> 11:30.733
These things are standing between us.

11:32.666 --> 11:36.403
I feel like I want to scream, I want to cry,

11:36.405 --> 11:40.309
like I want to do all these things,
and I can't.

11:40.311 --> 11:43.112
I'm feeling what the living here feel.

11:43.114 --> 11:44.947
It feels like terror.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.085
So, what about experiences
that you can't explain

11:54.087 --> 11:55.487
while you've been working here.

11:55.489 --> 11:56.755
- Have you had any?
- Yes.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.490
Okay, tell me about some of them.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.359
Yeah, I've seen shadow figures.

12:00.361 --> 12:02.528
That's the only way I can describe it.

12:02.530 --> 12:03.997
Okay, how often?

12:03.999 --> 12:07.301
Probably five times, at least.

12:07.303 --> 12:09.004
So, when you see this shadow thing,

12:09.006 --> 12:11.220
you sure it's not a reflection
of a shadow of somebody?

12:11.245 --> 12:11.774
No.

12:11.776 --> 12:15.181
- How are you so sure?
- No, I... how could it be a reflection?

12:15.183 --> 12:17.014
I mean, there was nobody here.

12:17.016 --> 12:18.916
Are you uncomfortable working here?

12:18.918 --> 12:23.323
I'm not, in the building itself, but...

12:23.325 --> 12:25.992
there's something that's
following me home now.

12:25.994 --> 12:28.698
I'm wondering if it's the bad energy,

12:28.700 --> 12:30.100
and he doesn't like

12:30.102 --> 12:33.969
that we're talking about all
this and stirring things up.

12:33.971 --> 12:36.972
About three or four weeks ago,

12:36.974 --> 12:40.141
about 3:00 in the morning,
I was sound asleep,

12:40.143 --> 12:41.844
and the end of my bed...

12:41.846 --> 12:44.549
Pretend like this is the bed, right?

12:44.551 --> 12:46.316
And here's my bedspread.

12:46.318 --> 12:48.449
We're talking a heavy comforter.

12:48.451 --> 12:52.120
It was clawing like this, like this,

12:52.122 --> 12:56.023
and then it took it and went like this.

12:56.825 --> 13:00.428
Scared me to death.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.097
I said it out loud,

13:02.099 --> 13:05.700
"[Bleep], get the [bleep] out of my house."

13:05.702 --> 13:07.637
- Do you have animals in the house?
- No animals.

13:07.638 --> 13:09.995
- Okay, that had to scare
the hell out of you. - It did.

13:10.838 --> 13:12.071
Feel me.

13:12.073 --> 13:13.774
Yeah, you are. You're shaking.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.409
Yeah, I'm shaking.

13:15.411 --> 13:19.613
I don't want to cry,
but I'm not sleeping well,

13:19.615 --> 13:22.351
and I'll thank you if
I can get some answers.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.719
I just want it to stop.

13:27.258 --> 13:30.028
Sometimes these dark things that are here

13:30.030 --> 13:32.096
will leave with people.

13:32.098 --> 13:34.998
They'll stay with them,
or they come back?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.901
I don't feel like they come back.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.536
I do feel like they stay with them.

13:38.538 --> 13:42.490
Can they do anything
physical to the living?

13:42.515 --> 13:43.807
Yes, it...

13:45.312 --> 13:47.112
You know, I think people can be harmed.

13:47.114 --> 13:50.649
I think people could become possessed.

13:50.651 --> 13:55.156
Suggestions being put into people's minds.

13:55.158 --> 13:59.964
This is how they influence, whispering...

14:02.701 --> 14:05.702
Into your mind,

14:05.704 --> 14:09.708
making you do bad things to people.

14:09.710 --> 14:13.408
I feel like doing bad things.

14:13.410 --> 14:15.144
I feel like hurting people.

14:16.347 --> 14:20.218
Living people have done very bad things

14:20.220 --> 14:24.685
after they've left this place.

14:24.687 --> 14:27.018
Do you know what they want?

14:28.355 --> 14:30.725
Chaos and destruction.

14:46.514 --> 14:49.652
Mike is obsessed with
this Mary Jane Reed murder case,

14:49.654 --> 14:52.156
and he wanted to show me
all the evidence he found.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.625
But honestly,
I don't trust civilian investigators.

14:55.627 --> 14:58.494
So, I called on a pro, a retired detective

14:58.496 --> 15:00.530
who has the case file and
is gonna walk me through it.

15:08.972 --> 15:11.688
So, Bill,
I want to start out with a clean slate.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.753
What do you know about this case?

15:13.755 --> 15:16.425
Stanley Skridla. Here's a picture of him.

15:16.427 --> 15:18.857
He's a former Navy Seabee.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.983
June 24, 1948,

15:22.083 --> 15:25.453
he meets up with this young girl,
Mary Jane Reed,

15:25.455 --> 15:28.622
and they set up to go on a date.

15:28.624 --> 15:30.724
- Okay.
- And they end up at this place

15:30.726 --> 15:33.231
called Alexander's Log Cabin Inn,

15:33.233 --> 15:36.165
- which is a bar.
- Okay.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.567
They meet up with a deputy sheriff

15:38.569 --> 15:40.871
by the name of Willard Burright,

15:40.873 --> 15:42.406
better known as "Jiggs"

15:42.408 --> 15:45.045
to most of the people around the area.

15:45.047 --> 15:47.248
He's a 42-year-old married man,

15:47.250 --> 15:48.350
and it's rumored that

15:48.352 --> 15:52.455
he's having an affair with Mary Jane.

15:52.457 --> 15:54.026
Okay, if that's the case,

15:54.028 --> 15:56.264
and she walks in with a young guy...

15:56.266 --> 15:58.133
The deputy sheriff walks up to them,

15:58.135 --> 16:00.232
and he wants Mary Jane to leave with him.

16:00.234 --> 16:02.534
And she refuses.

16:02.536 --> 16:04.505
They end up in this big argument,

16:04.507 --> 16:06.541
and she ends up slapping the deputy

16:06.543 --> 16:10.244
and then leaves out of there with Skridla.

16:10.246 --> 16:12.111
Okay, so what happens next?

16:12.113 --> 16:14.412
They end up at your client's property,

16:14.414 --> 16:17.017
which was called the Stenhouse back then.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.486
They were gonna go inside,

16:18.488 --> 16:19.987
but according to witnesses,

16:19.989 --> 16:21.454
Stanley gets out of the car,

16:21.456 --> 16:22.588
but all of a sudden,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.324
he stops and gets back in his car,

16:24.326 --> 16:25.592
and they drive off,

16:25.594 --> 16:29.361
and that's the last time
that anybody saw them alive.

16:43.305 --> 16:45.541
There's people down here.

16:45.543 --> 16:47.212
Who?

16:48.583 --> 16:53.652
There's a man and this woman.

16:53.654 --> 16:56.855
Two, maybe three people.

17:01.664 --> 17:03.931
Female has brown, curly hair.

17:03.933 --> 17:06.801
She's wearing a dress.

17:06.804 --> 17:10.273
I'm hearing she's up to no good.

17:10.276 --> 17:14.516
They look scared.

17:18.353 --> 17:20.688
I do feel like there was a female victim,

17:20.690 --> 17:23.127
but I also feel like there's a male victim.

17:23.128 --> 17:28.433
Her and this man knew each other,

17:28.435 --> 17:30.770
possibly killed either at the same time

17:30.772 --> 17:33.035
or very [bleep] close.

17:35.372 --> 17:37.275
When they left the Stenhouse,

17:37.277 --> 17:39.811
they left somewhere just before midnight,

17:39.813 --> 17:43.279
and witnesses said that
they were being followed

17:43.281 --> 17:44.881
by an older model car

17:44.883 --> 17:47.518
with two pretty good-sized guys in there.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.656
And they went to a very
popular make-out area

17:51.658 --> 17:53.558
called Lover's Lane.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.493
Okay.

17:55.495 --> 17:59.196
Stanley's body was actually
found there the next morning,

17:59.198 --> 18:01.133
- lying in a ditch.
- Really?

18:01.135 --> 18:03.938
I have a picture here of the crime scene.

18:03.940 --> 18:07.442
And what was his cause of death?

18:07.444 --> 18:08.776
Multiple gunshot wounds

18:08.778 --> 18:12.348
- to his abdomen, his chest...
- Geez.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.150
His groin, his arm.

18:14.152 --> 18:16.787
But there was another report that indicated

18:16.789 --> 18:19.359
that he had one gunshot wound to his back.

18:19.361 --> 18:21.630
Okay, where's Mary Jane?

18:21.632 --> 18:25.233
Mary Jane's body was found four days later,

18:25.235 --> 18:30.339
and she's about a mile away
from where Skridla was found.

18:30.341 --> 18:34.009
- Okay.
- This is a picture of her crime scene.

18:34.011 --> 18:36.679
And what was her cause of death?

18:36.681 --> 18:40.047
One gunshot wound through
the base of the skull.

18:41.116 --> 18:43.050
All right, so it sounds like

18:43.052 --> 18:45.786
whoever did these murders killed him first,

18:45.788 --> 18:48.120
and then later on killed her

18:48.122 --> 18:49.855
and then dumped her
body in a different spot.

18:49.955 --> 18:51.290
Right.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.827
Somebody's hitting me on the back.

18:55.829 --> 18:58.727
Upper left of my back.

18:58.729 --> 19:00.061
Someone's hitting me there,

19:00.063 --> 19:01.763
hitting me there, hitting me there,

19:01.765 --> 19:03.431
falling down on the ground,

19:03.433 --> 19:04.566
but it's dark.

19:04.568 --> 19:06.465
I don't know if it's actually down here.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.566
Might be outside.

19:10.005 --> 19:13.706
I think it's like a sneak attack.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.374
Someone hits the... hits
the [bleep] ground.

19:18.442 --> 19:20.308
Mm.

19:20.310 --> 19:23.211
There's a lot of pain here.

19:23.213 --> 19:27.448
I do feel stabbing-like sensations.

19:27.450 --> 19:32.148
Neck area, chest area, and the back.

19:32.150 --> 19:35.152
It's like sharp pains.

19:35.154 --> 19:38.890
I feel this being crushed.

19:38.892 --> 19:41.558
Mm, to the throat.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.962
I think the female's with the neck.

19:44.964 --> 19:47.263
I think the male is to the back.

19:50.403 --> 19:52.737
Now,
I know this is an unsolved double homicide,

19:52.739 --> 19:54.902
but was anybody ever charged in this case?

19:54.904 --> 19:56.270
There were no arrests made,

19:56.272 --> 19:58.508
but there's two possibilities in this case.

19:58.510 --> 20:02.178
Well, first, there was Jiggs,
the deputy sheriff.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.245
- Okay, for obvious reasons.
- Yes.

20:04.247 --> 20:05.845
Why wasn't he ever charged?

20:05.847 --> 20:07.917
Well, there's a couple
interesting points about that.

20:07.919 --> 20:09.785
He was actually the detective

20:09.787 --> 20:12.853
that was heading up the investigation.

20:12.855 --> 20:15.629
Okay, there's a little
conflict of interest there.

20:15.654 --> 20:16.323
Yeah.

20:16.325 --> 20:19.290
And all the evidence that
was brought out against him

20:19.292 --> 20:21.559
- was strictly circumstantial.
- Okay.

20:21.561 --> 20:22.892
Now, what about the two guys

20:22.894 --> 20:24.561
following them out of the parking lot?

20:24.563 --> 20:26.196
Those are the other two suspects.

20:26.198 --> 20:29.424
In 1948, a guy by the
name of Harry Deshazo...

20:29.449 --> 20:30.230
Okay.

20:30.232 --> 20:34.139
Shows up at the sheriff's
office and tries to confess.

20:34.141 --> 20:36.673
Oh. He tells the sheriff's department

20:36.675 --> 20:39.842
that he and his brother, Perry,

20:39.844 --> 20:44.279
followed them to Lover's Lane
and were going to rob them,

20:44.281 --> 20:47.711
but Harry says that this robbery went bad,

20:47.713 --> 20:50.916
and Perry ends up shooting the two victims.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.384
That's interesting.

20:52.386 --> 20:54.719
Why would the sheriff sit on that?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.287
- We don't know.
- Wow.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.123
I don't know if we'll ever know.

21:02.993 --> 21:08.263
There's these three people
who might be involved.

21:08.265 --> 21:10.263
With?

21:10.265 --> 21:12.998
This situation,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.701
which is, I think, two men and one woman.

21:15.703 --> 21:17.873
Okay.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.907
Then I'm getting a completely other image

21:19.909 --> 21:22.277
of a guy standing with a
double-barrel shotgun...

21:24.517 --> 21:25.583
holding it on someone...

21:25.585 --> 21:27.685
I don't see who...

21:27.687 --> 21:32.361
and in a rage.

21:32.363 --> 21:35.731
They're trying to

21:35.733 --> 21:38.101
communicate to me what happened.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.412
Oh,

21:43.414 --> 21:46.014
You okay?

21:46.016 --> 21:48.417
No, no, no. No, no, no.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.133
Surprisingly, Mary Jane Reed's brother

22:10.135 --> 22:11.934
is still alive <i>and</i> living in town,

22:11.936 --> 22:15.465
so I reached out to him,
and he agreed to talk to me.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.632
He said his sister's murder

22:17.634 --> 22:19.666
ended up destroying their family.

22:30.105 --> 22:32.172
I know it's been a very long time,

22:32.174 --> 22:33.955
but my condolences on
your sister's death.

22:33.980 --> 22:34.907
Thank you.

22:34.909 --> 22:37.809
Mary Jane kind of was my pride and joy,

22:37.811 --> 22:40.412
and she took very good care of me.

22:40.414 --> 22:42.416
How did you take it?

22:42.418 --> 22:44.448
Oh, I... I did my share of bawling.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.284
I missed her very much.

22:47.286 --> 22:48.954
What about the murder itself?

22:48.956 --> 22:51.487
Are you still concerned
about finding out who did it?

22:51.489 --> 22:54.723
I really believe it was the sheriff.

22:54.725 --> 22:56.862
Jiggs was his name, right?

22:56.864 --> 22:59.564
Jiggs Burright, yes.

22:59.566 --> 23:02.102
Every now and then, he would just stop

23:02.104 --> 23:05.235
and just sit there in his
car and look over at us.

23:05.237 --> 23:07.302
Really?

23:07.304 --> 23:09.103
Did you think he was
obsessed with your sister?

23:09.105 --> 23:13.908
Yes, and I also believe that
he was very jealous of her.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.976
Now, why do you say that?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.310
'Cause if she was with someone else,

23:18.312 --> 23:20.913
it seemed like he got upset with her.

23:24.985 --> 23:26.785
These scary people,

23:26.787 --> 23:29.424
it's very difficult for them to come out

23:29.426 --> 23:34.195
because there are things

23:34.197 --> 23:38.434
that are trying to prevent
that from happening.

23:38.436 --> 23:40.537
The problem here is that

23:40.539 --> 23:44.678
the dead aren't allowed to speak,

23:44.680 --> 23:48.280
and really, the living aren't, either.

23:48.282 --> 23:55.149
These evil [bleep] are trying
desperately to maintain control,

23:55.151 --> 23:57.284
keeping everybody trapped.

23:59.921 --> 24:03.188
Now they're gonna be tortured, see?

24:03.190 --> 24:04.254
What does that mean?

24:07.494 --> 24:10.393
They're... gonna...

24:12.495 --> 24:14.230
make it bad for them.

24:17.599 --> 24:19.733
Do you remember anything

24:19.735 --> 24:21.836
about the day you found
out about your sister?

24:21.838 --> 24:23.804
Yes, I do, very clear.

24:23.806 --> 24:25.138
I'll never forget it.

24:25.140 --> 24:27.672
I was 6 at the time,

24:27.674 --> 24:30.309
and two detectives came to the house,

24:30.311 --> 24:32.544
and my mother opened the door,

24:32.546 --> 24:36.017
and I was standing there with her,
holding her hand.

24:36.019 --> 24:38.386
- Okay.
- They said, "Mrs. Reed,

24:38.388 --> 24:40.557
"we got very bad news for you.

24:40.559 --> 24:43.662
We found Mary Jane. She was murdered."

24:44.930 --> 24:49.833
And I felt my mother's knees just weakening.

24:49.835 --> 24:53.505
I thought she was gonna fall.

24:53.507 --> 24:55.808
And one of the officers
kind of got a hold of her

24:55.810 --> 24:57.276
and held her up for a while.

24:57.278 --> 25:00.684
Now,
you had mentioned that... on the phone...

25:00.686 --> 25:04.654
- things got really bad at home after that.
- Very bad.

25:04.656 --> 25:05.656
What happened?

25:05.658 --> 25:07.659
They ended up sending her down

25:07.661 --> 25:11.397
to East Moline State Hospital at that time.

25:11.399 --> 25:14.167
She was there over a year.

25:14.169 --> 25:15.703
After the year that she was there,

25:15.705 --> 25:16.871
did it help her any?

25:16.873 --> 25:20.511
She wasn't quite as
nervous as she was prior,

25:20.513 --> 25:26.612
but yet... she wasn't herself, either.

25:26.614 --> 25:29.414
This is a picture of my father and mother

25:29.416 --> 25:31.548
on their 50th wedding anniversary.

25:31.550 --> 25:34.117
Your mom looks sad in this photo.

25:34.119 --> 25:37.158
So does your father, actually.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.699
Well, see,
I made a promise to her before she died.

25:40.701 --> 25:44.272
She looked me in the eye, and she said,

25:44.274 --> 25:48.744
"There's one thing I want you to do for me.

25:48.746 --> 25:52.883
I want you to find out
who killed Mary Jane."

25:52.885 --> 25:57.523
I looked her in the eye,
and I said, "I'll try, mother."

26:07.169 --> 26:10.072
I saw several entities during my walk,

26:10.074 --> 26:12.544
but the murdered woman in the basement

26:12.546 --> 26:14.146
had me the most concerned.

26:14.148 --> 26:17.953
When I initially met her,
she was kind of crouched down.

26:17.955 --> 26:21.892
She's white, darker brown hair.

26:21.894 --> 26:26.399
Her face was more round, pretty delicate.

26:26.401 --> 26:28.332
How old would you say she was?

26:28.334 --> 26:30.764
18 to 23.

26:35.801 --> 26:37.801
Is this what you saw?

26:37.803 --> 26:39.804
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:59.678 --> 27:02.214
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:02.216 --> 27:03.786
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:03.788 --> 27:07.255
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:07.257 --> 27:08.789
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Mike.

27:08.791 --> 27:10.491
He owns this place.

27:10.493 --> 27:13.326
He's not our typical client for two reasons.

27:13.328 --> 27:15.761
One, he used to be the mayor here,

27:15.763 --> 27:19.564
and two, he thinks he knows
who's haunting his business.

27:19.566 --> 27:21.498
I mean, as the night goes by,

27:21.500 --> 27:23.899
we'll find out if you're right or not.

27:23.901 --> 27:26.167
This is Marge.
She's been working here a long, long time.

27:26.169 --> 27:28.535
Now that the activity's gotten much,
much worse,

27:28.537 --> 27:30.338
she's pretty scared for her own safety.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.139
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

27:33.141 --> 27:38.175
I'm just gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

27:38.177 --> 27:40.044
I went down into the basement,

27:40.046 --> 27:46.254
and I didn't really like
it down there very much.

27:46.256 --> 27:48.889
I felt very unwelcome.

27:50.858 --> 27:53.427
And after a minute,

27:53.429 --> 27:57.066
I saw three people hunched down there,

27:57.068 --> 27:59.704
and it was two men and one woman.

27:59.706 --> 28:02.042
Somehow, they know each other.

28:02.044 --> 28:03.744
I don't know how, but there...

28:03.746 --> 28:05.779
there's a familiarity there between them.

28:05.781 --> 28:11.149
And she was indicating
that she had been murdered.

28:12.984 --> 28:16.821
And it seemed like she and the man she knew

28:16.823 --> 28:20.090
either died at the same time
or very close to each other.

28:20.092 --> 28:23.856
She was wearing a nice dress.
It was kind of dusk.

28:23.858 --> 28:27.828
Amy,
I got a pretty good idea of what you saw.

28:27.830 --> 28:30.529
It's one of the main reasons we're here.

28:30.531 --> 28:32.530
Back in 1948, there was a double homicide.

28:32.532 --> 28:34.898
The victims were Mary Jane Reed

28:34.900 --> 28:37.870
and a guy named Stanley Skridla.

28:37.872 --> 28:39.303
This is Mary Jane.

28:43.442 --> 28:45.677
Here's a picture of Stanley.

28:45.679 --> 28:48.783
Stanley was 28 years old. She was 17.

28:48.785 --> 28:51.820
Now,
she went on a date with Stanley that night,

28:51.822 --> 28:53.288
first time.

28:53.290 --> 28:54.858
The last place they were seen alive

28:54.860 --> 28:57.029
was actually in the parking
lot of this restaurant.

28:59.399 --> 29:01.134
Mike is very fixated on this case.

29:01.136 --> 29:02.369
He thinks it's the reason

29:02.371 --> 29:04.171
the restaurant is actually haunted.

29:04.173 --> 29:07.641
I've been working on it since 1999

29:07.643 --> 29:09.509
when I was elected mayor.

29:09.511 --> 29:15.984
I've spent tons of money
and hundreds of hours.

29:15.986 --> 29:17.852
He's actually lost his house over it,

29:17.854 --> 29:20.322
- that's how much this case means to him.
- Right.

29:20.324 --> 29:22.758
Now, did you get a good
look of anybody down there?

29:22.760 --> 29:25.459
Yes, I had a sketch done

29:25.461 --> 29:28.464
of the female that I saw in the basement.

29:28.466 --> 29:31.066
I got to see this.

29:36.072 --> 29:37.572
Wow.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.043
Yeah.

29:40.045 --> 29:43.812
You guys tell me.

29:48.289 --> 29:49.888
That's awful close, Amy.

29:49.890 --> 29:54.894
Look at the cheek line right here,
the eyebrows.

29:54.896 --> 29:56.162
It's close enough for me.

29:56.164 --> 29:57.864
All right, let me ask you a question.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.733
You get any idea of how these people died

29:59.735 --> 30:01.234
that were in the basement?

30:01.236 --> 30:04.740
I think it happened outside at night.

30:04.742 --> 30:06.908
The female indicated to me

30:06.910 --> 30:11.146
something with the throat area,
very painful.

30:11.148 --> 30:13.080
What about the man?

30:13.082 --> 30:15.116
I felt impact in my back.

30:15.118 --> 30:18.920
I felt the falling sensation,

30:18.922 --> 30:21.856
hit... my face hitting the gravel,

30:21.858 --> 30:24.226
so it was something, a dirt road.

30:24.228 --> 30:25.994
It was like a sneak attack.

30:25.996 --> 30:27.529
They either died together,

30:27.531 --> 30:30.433
or they died very close together.

30:30.435 --> 30:32.104
Wow.

30:32.106 --> 30:33.040
Dead on.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.541
I'm very impressed,

30:34.543 --> 30:36.743
Needless to say..

30:36.745 --> 30:39.213
This is the million-dollar question here.

30:39.215 --> 30:41.883
Any indication of who
might have killed them?

30:41.885 --> 30:45.184
She kind of indicated that it was two males.

30:47.756 --> 30:50.956
So, this is gonna make a lot
more sense to you, I think,

30:50.958 --> 30:53.289
once I lay out the rest of the evening

30:53.291 --> 30:56.029
that Stanley and Mary Jane were killed.

30:56.031 --> 30:56.965
Okay.

30:56.967 --> 30:58.798
Stanley picked her up at work.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.266
They went out on the town.

31:00.268 --> 31:03.468
They wound up at a tavern called
Alexander's Log Cabin Inn.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.902
They ran into this guy.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.973
I got a photo here of Deputy
Sheriff Willard Burright,

31:07.975 --> 31:09.274
also known as "Jiggs."

31:11.509 --> 31:12.643
Oh.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.049
Apparently, and this is documented

31:16.051 --> 31:18.051
in police reports from the time

31:18.053 --> 31:20.654
that they were having an affair.

31:20.656 --> 31:22.789
Jiggs was a 42-year-old married man.

31:22.791 --> 31:25.228
Mary Jane was 17.

31:26.863 --> 31:29.328
Now, when I spoke to Mary Jane's brother,

31:29.330 --> 31:30.496
who is still alive,

31:30.498 --> 31:32.166
he was maybe 6 at the time.

31:32.168 --> 31:33.803
He used to see him come by

31:33.805 --> 31:36.338
and just stand outside in the radio car

31:36.340 --> 31:38.406
and stare at her in the backyard.

31:40.276 --> 31:41.245
Oh.

31:41.247 --> 31:45.416
So, he sees her with Stanley,

31:45.418 --> 31:46.985
and he gets upset.

31:46.987 --> 31:49.056
They got into an altercation.

31:49.058 --> 31:51.092
She wound up smacking him
'cause he kept saying,

31:51.094 --> 31:52.958
"I want you to come with me, come with me."

31:52.960 --> 31:55.029
She's, like, "No,
leave me alone"... smacks him.

31:55.031 --> 31:56.761
Stanley and Mary Jane leave.

31:56.763 --> 31:58.528
Now, the next spot the two of them came to

31:58.530 --> 32:00.863
is this place,
which was known as the Stenhouse back then.

32:00.865 --> 32:03.232
They pull up to get into the parking lot.

32:03.234 --> 32:06.836
Stanley gets out, and for some reason,

32:06.838 --> 32:10.338
he gets back in and takes off.

32:10.340 --> 32:11.708
We don't know if something spooked him.

32:11.710 --> 32:13.011
According to witnesses,

32:13.013 --> 32:15.414
they said they were followed
by two big guys in a car.

32:16.281 --> 32:18.183
There's a place called Lover's Lane

32:18.185 --> 32:19.318
like most towns have.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.289
It's about a mile from here.

32:21.291 --> 32:24.157
Next morning,
they find Stanley's body facedown.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.658
He was shot four times...

32:25.660 --> 32:28.430
three in the front, one in the back.

32:28.432 --> 32:32.665
That's Stanley's death certificate here.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.702
Now, four days later,

32:34.704 --> 32:39.843
Mary Jane's body was found
about a mile away in a ditch.

32:41.378 --> 32:42.444
Now, when she's found,

32:42.446 --> 32:44.344
she's found with a single gunshot wound

32:44.346 --> 32:45.513
to the back of the head.

32:45.515 --> 32:47.482
Now, I got her death certificate here.

32:50.248 --> 32:52.084
Now,
here's where it gets really interesting.

32:52.086 --> 32:53.954
About 10 years ago,
Mike had the body exhumed.

32:53.956 --> 32:55.423
Okay.

32:55.425 --> 32:57.422
He was hoping to find some
clues about the murder.

32:57.424 --> 32:59.957
Now, you said you thought
she suffered a neck injury.

32:59.959 --> 33:02.494
A couple of the anthropologists
that looked at the body

33:02.496 --> 33:04.330
thought that the head was decapitated.

33:05.532 --> 33:07.465
Oh, my God.

33:07.467 --> 33:09.738
Here's the skull that they exhumed.

33:14.776 --> 33:16.144
Right.

33:16.146 --> 33:17.812
Now, Amy, you got to understand something.

33:17.814 --> 33:18.879
This case was never solved,

33:18.881 --> 33:20.348
but according to the police reports,

33:20.350 --> 33:21.683
there were a couple of suspects.

33:21.685 --> 33:23.386
One of 'em was Jiggs.

33:23.388 --> 33:25.921
Mike is convinced he did this.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.522
Am I right?

33:27.524 --> 33:32.495
He is a person of interest
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

33:32.497 --> 33:35.398
Who I think it is is this guy.

33:36.267 --> 33:37.967
This is Perry Deshazo.

33:37.969 --> 33:40.068
Remember those two guys witnesses saw

33:40.070 --> 33:41.269
following the couple?

33:41.271 --> 33:43.438
I think he was one of 'em.

33:43.440 --> 33:47.138
Perry's brother, Harry,
went to the ex-sheriff

33:47.140 --> 33:49.942
trying to basically confess to the crime.

33:49.944 --> 33:54.278
He admitted that they went to
go rob Mary Jane and Stanley.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.378
Went bad. Stanley fought back, got shot.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.781
Mary's a witness.

33:58.783 --> 34:00.915
They shoot her in the back of the head,

34:00.917 --> 34:02.781
and they dump both their bodies.

34:02.783 --> 34:04.049
Now, for some reason,

34:04.051 --> 34:06.985
the ex-sheriff they told
sat on this information.

34:06.987 --> 34:09.351
These guys were never arrested.

34:09.353 --> 34:11.487
And you don't think it's possible

34:11.489 --> 34:14.257
that this could have
been orchestrated by him?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.726
Cops know what they're doing.

34:15.728 --> 34:17.127
I'm curious what you think.

34:17.129 --> 34:19.695
I know what I think.
I'm curious what you think.

34:19.697 --> 34:21.563
Well, I know it was definitely two men.

34:21.565 --> 34:25.639
I know that the man

34:25.641 --> 34:29.974
who hit and killed the other man

34:29.976 --> 34:31.409
was definitely strong.

34:31.411 --> 34:34.078
The thing that's bothering me, it's, like,

34:34.080 --> 34:37.080
why would I hear, "She's up to no good"?

34:41.723 --> 34:43.125
What else did you see on your walk?

34:43.127 --> 34:44.761
I know we've been harping on this homicide.

34:44.763 --> 34:48.934
There's something else going on here.

34:50.570 --> 34:56.074
I could feel like the dead
people wanting to talk

34:56.077 --> 34:59.182
or wanting to reach out to me,
but I couldn't.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.382
- The connection could not be made.
- Mm-hmm.

35:01.384 --> 35:03.682
The reason for that is,
I saw these dark things,

35:03.684 --> 35:05.653
and they were blocking me.

35:05.655 --> 35:07.155
I felt like these things

35:07.157 --> 35:09.524
would definitely be occasionally seen

35:09.526 --> 35:13.796
as far as, like,
this feeling of this oppressive darkness.

35:13.798 --> 35:18.537
Yeah, I've seen shadows in
the hallway right out front.

35:18.539 --> 35:21.538
The shadows appear out of
the corner of your eye,

35:21.540 --> 35:22.638
and then there's nobody there.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.272
Okay, that makes sense.

35:24.274 --> 35:29.116
I felt that this could have a
very big impact on the living,

35:29.118 --> 35:31.684
like, both physically and emotionally.

35:31.686 --> 35:35.688
I think that people here could
lose control over themselves

35:35.690 --> 35:37.556
and not really understand why.

35:37.558 --> 35:40.387
Like, at points,
I wanted to just start screaming,

35:40.389 --> 35:41.721
like, with frustration,

35:41.723 --> 35:43.789
and then I wanted to start crying.

35:43.791 --> 35:48.122
These things are also
capable of affecting memory.

35:48.124 --> 35:50.823
Anytime I would be on to something,

35:50.825 --> 35:53.192
that's when my mind would
be completely erased,

35:53.194 --> 35:54.893
and I couldn't even,

35:54.895 --> 35:57.497
like, recall what I was just thinking.

35:57.499 --> 35:59.199
Oh, my gosh.

35:59.201 --> 36:00.599
And this is how I think

36:00.601 --> 36:02.500
this thing is keeping control

36:02.502 --> 36:04.634
over both the dead and the living.

36:04.636 --> 36:06.904
It's kind of creating a trap.

36:06.906 --> 36:09.408
Could this thing where you're
saying it erased the mind

36:09.410 --> 36:10.576
- do that to the living here?
- Yes.

36:10.578 --> 36:13.776
So, what I was experiencing
with the living,

36:13.778 --> 36:15.145
interviewing them,

36:15.147 --> 36:16.514
to tell you the truth,
I was getting pissed.

36:16.516 --> 36:18.882
It felt like I was being lied to.

36:18.884 --> 36:21.852
That's when my cop ears
get raised a little.

36:21.854 --> 36:23.921
- Because you think they're lying.
- Right.

36:23.923 --> 36:25.924
'Cause you think they're
manipulating the truth.

36:25.949 --> 36:26.424
Yes.

36:26.426 --> 36:28.660
Wouldn't a cop want to make
another cop think that,

36:28.662 --> 36:30.793
if they were trying to
throw them off their trail?

36:30.818 --> 36:31.652
Possibly, yeah.

36:32.864 --> 36:36.164
I'm looking at something
here as a possibility.

36:36.166 --> 36:41.101
Now,
here's what I was being told could be done

36:41.103 --> 36:43.236
that, you know, people come here,

36:43.238 --> 36:45.670
and that entities can follow them home.

36:46.806 --> 36:49.342
It can cause huge problems for the living.

36:49.344 --> 36:52.773
It's likely their homes will become active.

36:54.343 --> 36:56.112
People could become possessed,

36:56.114 --> 36:59.281
and people could become physically harmed.

36:59.283 --> 37:00.946
Oh, my God.

37:01.447 --> 37:02.614
That's the reason

37:02.616 --> 37:04.184
I asked Marge to sit
down with us at the table

37:04.186 --> 37:07.686
because she felt something
followed her home.

37:07.688 --> 37:10.422
About a month ago, I went home,

37:10.424 --> 37:13.356
and I was having a dream,

37:13.358 --> 37:17.262
and I was fighting something in this dream.

37:17.264 --> 37:18.695
Well, I actually woke up,

37:18.697 --> 37:20.429
it took the bottom of my bedspread,

37:20.431 --> 37:24.633
and it went like...
and it was clawing like this.

37:24.635 --> 37:26.834
And then it took it,
and it literally took it like this.

37:28.303 --> 37:30.839
I literally jumped out
of that bed screaming.

37:32.175 --> 37:34.109
I was hearing the word "Legion."

37:34.111 --> 37:35.275
"We are the legion,"

37:35.277 --> 37:37.610
which is demonic...

37:37.612 --> 37:40.843
but it wasn't adding up for me.

37:40.845 --> 37:43.045
It just wasn't adding up
for me as far as it being

37:43.047 --> 37:45.349
a legion of demons running amuck.

37:45.351 --> 37:48.483
Then what the hell do you think it is?

37:48.485 --> 37:49.815
I really...

37:49.817 --> 37:51.149
I'm leaning towards the cop.

38:10.970 --> 38:13.201
I was hearing the word "Legion,"

38:13.203 --> 38:15.167
but it wasn't adding up for me.

38:15.169 --> 38:17.571
It just wasn't adding up
for me as far as it being

38:17.573 --> 38:19.974
a legion of demons running amuck.

38:19.976 --> 38:23.107
Then what the hell do you think it is?

38:23.109 --> 38:24.476
I really...

38:24.478 --> 38:26.144
I'm leaning towards the cop.

38:29.648 --> 38:31.548
I was never convinced

38:31.550 --> 38:35.083
that there were, you know, demons here.

38:35.085 --> 38:37.317
But somehow Jiggs kind of figured out

38:37.319 --> 38:39.751
- how to throw you off track.
- Yes, yes.

38:39.753 --> 38:41.950
- Okay.
- Trying to set up the scene

38:41.952 --> 38:44.152
to look like there's demonic [bleep]

38:45.956 --> 38:50.959
And I'm going based on how efficiently

38:50.961 --> 38:55.162
- he is manipulating this place...
- This place.

38:55.164 --> 38:57.828
The people in it, me,

38:57.830 --> 39:00.716
you know, to not get to the truth.

39:04.065 --> 39:05.632
So, everything that's going on here...

39:05.634 --> 39:07.234
people getting tugged,

39:07.236 --> 39:10.969
the memory scrubbing, so to speak,

39:10.971 --> 39:13.839
things tossed, followed home, the shadows,

39:13.841 --> 39:16.406
that's all coming from Jiggs?

39:16.408 --> 39:19.207
Yes, that's my belief, yes.

39:19.209 --> 39:21.378
I believe the police chief

39:21.380 --> 39:23.880
was the mastermind behind these murders,

39:23.882 --> 39:26.350
and in death, he's trapping the victims here

39:26.352 --> 39:29.350
so that the truth about his
part in organizing the crime

39:29.352 --> 39:30.884
never gets out.

39:33.522 --> 39:35.525
So, Mike, through all these years,

39:35.527 --> 39:37.692
you thought the haunting
of your business here

39:37.694 --> 39:39.894
had to do with the Mary
Jane Reed murder case,

39:39.896 --> 39:41.496
and amazingly, you were right.

39:41.498 --> 39:42.964
But the other thing is,

39:42.966 --> 39:45.432
you got some pretty vicious entity here

39:45.434 --> 39:46.898
doing some crazy stuff.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.335
So, we know what it is,

39:49.337 --> 39:51.071
but we don't know how to fight it.

39:51.073 --> 39:53.471
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:57.142 --> 40:01.842
So, what I would like you to do is for you

40:01.844 --> 40:06.180
to demand Mary Jane and this man

40:06.182 --> 40:09.814
leave this restaurant with you.

40:09.816 --> 40:12.550
You have to take them away from here.

40:12.552 --> 40:14.721
What I want you to say

40:14.723 --> 40:17.889
is basically that they can go,

40:17.891 --> 40:20.453
that you're releasing them.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.256
They're not gonna feel trapped anymore,

40:22.258 --> 40:27.226
and in all likelihood, they will all go.

40:27.228 --> 40:28.860
Now, let me ask you a question.

40:28.862 --> 40:30.829
Is she aware of what Mike's gone through

40:30.831 --> 40:35.667
- to help try to solve her...
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

40:35.669 --> 40:37.401
And I think that might make it

40:37.403 --> 40:39.703
a little bit even harder for her to let go.

40:39.705 --> 40:43.006
But you're gonna be her hero.

40:46.247 --> 40:49.949
The second step is

40:49.951 --> 40:54.080
for a holy man to come
in to get rid of him.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.507
The cop.

40:55.607 --> 40:57.676
I want the holy man

40:57.678 --> 41:01.748
to do, like,
a blessing and a sermon ceremony...

41:01.750 --> 41:06.753
because he has a root fear of religion.

41:06.755 --> 41:11.158
His thing is about self-preservation.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.826
He doesn't want to go to Hell.

41:15.762 --> 41:17.495
I like her plan.

41:17.497 --> 41:19.698
Are you gonna take Amy's advice on this

41:19.700 --> 41:21.842
and do what she asks? Why, of course.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.980
Anything for peace of mind

41:24.982 --> 41:27.313
and create a safe environment.

41:27.315 --> 41:29.778
And Marge, are you gonna help out with this?

41:29.780 --> 41:33.679
Whatever I can do. Whatever he asks.

41:33.681 --> 41:38.418
How are you gonna feel about
letting go of Mary Jane?

41:38.420 --> 41:41.191
Anything that can bring the family closure

41:41.193 --> 41:44.030
and bring her unrested soul closure

41:44.032 --> 41:47.034
is a game winner as far as I'm concerned.

41:49.672 --> 41:52.208
It won't be easy removing
the layers of dead people

41:52.210 --> 41:54.511
inside this location,

41:54.513 --> 41:57.444
but if Mike and Marge follow my advice,

41:57.446 --> 41:59.312
the dead will be set free,

41:59.314 --> 42:00.747
and Mike can find peace

42:00.749 --> 42:04.017
knowing he's put a stop
to Mary Jane's suffering.
