[Foggy] <i>Karen, the gun. Where is it?</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:50.175
[Karen] Bottom of the Hudson.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.426
Did you touch the body?

00:52.385 --> 00:53.887
He said he was gonna kill you.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.849
You and Matt and my family.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.851
He said I would die
knowing I got you all killed.

00:59.934 --> 01:04.064
Karen, that's awful, but, please,
you have to focus.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.982
Did you touch the body?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.569
No.[stammers]  I don't think so.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.321
What about your clothes?
Get blood on them?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.363
I threw them away.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.366
Foggy, can you not talk
to me like a lawyer and just...

01:15.450 --> 01:17.911
[sobs] just talk to me?

01:20.538 --> 01:22.499
I want you to tell me
that I'm a bad person.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.792
I can't say that.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.713
Why... why not? Because you're not.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.096
Then why are you looking at me like that?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.352
Because my friend...

01:43.436 --> 01:47.899
my amazing, kind, brilliant friend...

01:48.525 --> 01:50.360
went through something terrible.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.821
And I didn't know.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.366
When I got the gun,
I could've called the cops.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.867
I could've run.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.621
You were afraid for your life.
It was self-defense.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.334
Seven times.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.254
What?

02:11.798 --> 02:12.966
I shot him...

02:14.425 --> 02:15.802
seven times...

02:17.011 --> 02:18.888
because I wanted him dead.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.516
[clattering in distance]

[exhales]

02:45.748 --> 02:46.958
Hey, Karen.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.133
You need to pay me back for your rent.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.562
[theme music playing]

04:17.382 --> 04:19.550
[Matt] I've been staying where I grew up.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.096
There's a reason I stayed away, Karen.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.641
Yeah, if you say it was to protect me,
I'm seriously gonna throw up.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.518
[Matt] I can't protect you.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.853
Not from Fisk.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.065
Can't even protect myself.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.110
Sure you don't want coffee?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.487
[Matt] If you wanna yell at me...

04:41.364 --> 04:42.365
go right ahead.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.742
[microwave beeping]

04:48.663 --> 04:51.874
Did I ever tell you about my old neighbor,
when I was growing up?

04:52.750 --> 04:53.835
Mr. Larssen.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.213
Well, he was this nice Norwegian guy.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.048
He let his wife do his talking.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.760
But on the days when it'd get really cold
you know, and stuff would freeze,

05:02.844 --> 05:07.348
and you'd need help moving your car
or, uh... unstick a door,

05:07.432 --> 05:08.975
Mr. Larssen was always there.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.602
So, one winter,
his wife hit a patch of black ice.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.356
The whole town turned out for her funeral.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.319
And Mr. Larssen sat there
through the sermon...

05:20.570 --> 05:22.280
and then he gathered up his casseroles

05:22.363 --> 05:25.533
and went back to work on the farm,
like it was just another day.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.784
He never said a word about it.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.287
And I thought I'd go over there
and be a good neighbor...

05:29.912 --> 05:31.998
see if he wanted to talk
about what happened.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.542
And you know what he said?

05:38.963 --> 05:39.964
"What for?"

05:56.397 --> 05:58.274
[scoffs] You know what?

06:00.485 --> 06:03.237
You came to Foggy
because you needed something from him.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.618
What do you need from me, Matt?

06:10.578 --> 06:13.498
Fisk staged the attack on himself
in prison.

06:16.959 --> 06:21.172
That's how he, uh, tricked the FBI
into moving him to a hotel.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.637
Got some lifer named Jasper Evans
to shank him

06:27.720 --> 06:30.556
and then arranged for him
to walk out of prison.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.812
On the books, Evans is in solitary.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.356
In reality, he's been set free.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.318
-Can you prove that?
-Yeah, if I can find him.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.988
Get him to talk to you.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.283
<i>Bulletin </i>publishes the details.
Fisk is exposed.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.787
And the FBI will be forced
to send him back to prison.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.584
So, yeah, you're right.
I came to you 'cause I needed something.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.755
Your help.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.344
What do you say? You wanna help me?

07:11.347 --> 07:12.348
No.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.934
And I'm serious about the rent.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.822
[Julie] <i>You probably don't remember me.</i>
<i>I'm Julie.</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:30.992
<i>Do you wanna hang out after?</i>

07:31.659 --> 07:34.120
<i>How did you know I worked there</i>
<i>for three years?</i>

07:34.203 --> 07:35.663
<i>You were only there for one.</i>

07:37.165 --> 07:38.458
<i>Let go of me, Dex.</i>

07:38.541 --> 07:39.709
<i>I said let go!</i>

07:39.792 --> 07:42.545
<i>Let go of me, Dex. I said let go!</i>

07:42.628 --> 07:44.630
[breathing heavily]

08:19.957 --> 08:22.585
[Mercer on recording]
<i>Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.</i>

08:22.668 --> 08:25.379
<i>It just works better</i>
<i>with a North Star to guide you.</i>

08:26.088 --> 08:28.049
[Young Dex on recording]
<i>What if I can't find one?</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:30.009
[Mercer] <i>Then you'll rely</i>
<i>on our structure.</i>

08:30.426 --> 08:33.346
<i>A tidy physical space.</i>
<i>A disciplined vocation...</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:37.225
[alarm beeps]

08:40.853 --> 08:43.272
[cello music playing]

10:08.065 --> 10:11.485
[Ellison] This paper
takes its sourcing seriously.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.780
We don't publish unverified innuendo,
you know?

10:14.864 --> 10:15.990
Gossip...

10:16.240 --> 10:20.036
Ah, Ms. Page.
Yeah, I'm not boring you, am I?

10:21.537 --> 10:24.957
Anyway, in other news,
our illustrious publisher,

10:25.041 --> 10:26.375
in his infinite wisdom,

10:26.459 --> 10:29.378
has decided to change
our health care coverage, yet again.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.840
You should be getting your enrollment
packages sometime in the next week.

10:32.923 --> 10:37.303
I've already had a look at it.
My advice to you is, try not to get sick.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.348
Uh, any questions?

10:40.431 --> 10:42.433
[conversation continues indistinctly]

10:48.773 --> 10:52.026
[Karen] It's total bullshit.
I can't believe Matt would even ask.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.820
-But I still think you should help him.
-Oh, come on.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.030
Just hear me out.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.491
You agree to write the article
on one condition.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.618
Matt turns himself in to the FBI.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.869
What? No.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.706
They're only up in our chili
because they're looking for Matt.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.042
Once they have him...

11:08.125 --> 11:10.961
But he can't.
[stammers] He'll never agree to it.

11:11.504 --> 11:16.008
There's no reason to think the FBI
knows anything about Matt's other life.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.346
But if he can give 'em that witness,
Matt's in the clear.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.847
So we all are.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.018
I could reach out as Matt's attorney
and negotiate his surrender.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.858
Okay, but I'm not ready to forgive him.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.444
I get it.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.740
You know, you shouldn't be either.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.077
I mean, he... he stole your identity,
he made you a target.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.706
Has Matt been a shitty friend lately?
Without a doubt.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.043
But, deep down, I think it's hurting him
as much as it's hurting us.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.379
How do you figure?

11:53.462 --> 11:58.134
Because he could've gone to any reporter,
Karen, but he came to you.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.679
Maybe Matt's finally coming to his senses.

12:01.762 --> 12:06.434
But even if he isn't, the way
he's been treating us lately is on him.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.187
Us turning our backs would be on us.

12:11.313 --> 12:16.485
People have bailed on Matt his whole life,
and I'm not gonna be one of 'em.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.321
You do what you want, but...

12:19.947 --> 12:21.991
that's not the kind of friend I wanna be.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.702
[chuckles]

12:26.912 --> 12:29.582
[sighs] It's like you argue for a living
or something.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.878
Was it too much? It felt like too much.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.175
Matt said he was staying
at the place where he grew up.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.260
Do you know where that is?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.945
[scoffs] Don't you look pretty today. You know you're two hours early, right?

13:03.282 --> 13:07.369
-Yeah, the, uh, the neighbors kept me up.
-Again?

13:07.453 --> 13:10.498
Shit. You gotta move.
Or get them into couples therapy.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.665
If those were my neighbors,

13:11.749 --> 13:13.709
I'd go over there
and give them a piece of my mind.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.295

[snaps fingers]

13:34.230 --> 13:36.565
-Yeah.
-Where'd you go?

13:36.649 --> 13:37.900
It's feeding time.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.986
You know, I, uh... I got it.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.906
You sure?
You're not even on the clock yet.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.492
Yeah, I could use a decent cup of coffee.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.869
You mind going downstairs
and grabbing me one?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.371
And I'll feed the animal.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.997
He's all yours.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.359
[exhales]

14:34.248 --> 14:37.459
I don't know what strings you had
to pull to get that waitress a job,

14:37.543 --> 14:39.169
but it was a waste of your time.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.340
Yeah, they train us
in counterintel at Quantico.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.968
You really think I'm gonna fall
for some bush-league honey trap?

14:47.928 --> 14:50.639
You got it in your head
that she means something to me.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.683
But she doesn't.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.103
She doesn't mean shit to me.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.610
So what? You...

15:02.693 --> 15:05.613
You have me tailed for a few days,
you think you know me?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.114
Think you got me dialed?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.242
You don't, all right?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.453
You don't know anything about me.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.749
Say something!

15:23.547 --> 15:25.341
[inhales] When I was a boy...

15:26.508 --> 15:27.509
I...

15:28.844 --> 15:32.514
beat my father's skull in with a hammer.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.392
I was 12 years old.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.316
Young for my age, in fact.
Terribly inexperienced.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.902
I'd never been to a dance
with a girl or...

15:45.694 --> 15:47.529
stayed up past midnight.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.077
Never been out of the city
or even taken the subway on my own.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.038
Yet there I was... twelve years old...

15:59.959 --> 16:02.211
standing over my father's body...

16:03.587 --> 16:06.548
watching him die by my hand.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.764
That feeling.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.891
That moment.

16:20.062 --> 16:24.608
I sense it's something
you're familiar with.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.694
You...

16:28.696 --> 16:33.826
were taught to hide beneath many fictions.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.912
You fashioned yourself

16:37.830 --> 16:41.542
into something the world would tolerate.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.588
A soldier doing his patriotic duty.
A sniper in the FBI.

16:47.464 --> 16:51.051
The watchful companion
of a nice young woman.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.012
You destroyed what we had.

16:53.595 --> 16:58.308
If it were honest and true,
no one could've destroyed it.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.519
I should've let you die.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.064
Stay back. [breathing heavily]

17:04.898 --> 17:06.817
Julie never would've understood you.

I'm sure he swore you to secrecy, but...

18:49.419 --> 18:51.213
he came to see me this morning.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.757
Asked for my help.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.635
Uh, is he here?

18:59.429 --> 19:02.015
No, he's not.

Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you.

[Maggie] "And some bloody their fists

19:18.657 --> 19:19.908

19:20.742 --> 19:22.744
It was in your piece about Daredevil.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.499
He's a complicated man.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.877
[Karen chuckles softly]

19:31.170 --> 19:32.963
[sighs] Yes. Yes, he is.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.300
I've read several of your articles
the past few days.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.012
-I've been trying to find some insight.
-Mmm.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.181
Did you find any?

19:44.057 --> 19:45.726
'Cause I sure as hell didn't.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.353
Oh, I'm... sorry.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.732
Wears you out, doesn't it?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.359
Saving him from himself.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.698
Yeah. I don't think I can do it anymore.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.160
I think I'm done.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.456
Matt was a tough one when he was a kid.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.044
He held the record for the most
Hail Marys, five years running.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.128
[Karen] Hmm.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.757
I wonder how many he'd have to say
these days.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.720
He came to us
right after he lost his father.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.180
His only family.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.933
He was alone in the world.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.644
In his private darkness.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.979
Surrounded by strangers.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.857
Yet he seemed fine during the day.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.653
He'd eat with the others...

20:38.862 --> 20:41.198
attend his classes, go to mass.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.956
But he was plagued by awful nightmares.

20:51.333 --> 20:55.295
He'd wake in a sweat, screaming.

20:56.713 --> 21:01.009
He didn't say what they were about.
He'd just call out for help.

21:01.802 --> 21:06.306
So I'd go, and I'd hold his hand
till he fell back asleep.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.022
But I have so many children under my care.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.610
Matthew wasn't the only one.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.073
His nightmares went on for months.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.787
One night, Matthew called for help
and I didn't answer.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.832
I didn't go to him.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.003
He never asked us for anything again.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.506
He shut us out. Shut everyone out.

21:41.049 --> 21:44.177
Everyone in Matthew's life abandoned him.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.596
Including me.

21:58.817 --> 22:03.363
When someone in need tries
to push you away...

22:04.531 --> 22:07.576
you have to find the strength
to hold on tighter.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.758
Seems unfair. It's an optics thing.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.677
[Winn] I can assure you,

22:25.761 --> 22:29.181
there'll be an immediate investigation
into how this leaked.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.141
[Hattley] Think of it as a paid vacation.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.810
[Winn] Take a minute, if you need,
to pack things up.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.773
[Mercer] <i>We prepared for this.</i>

22:38.565 --> 22:40.317
<i>You are gonna get a job...</i> <i>with a nice, rigid structure.</i>

22:42.235 --> 22:43.862
<i>You're gonna stick to your meds.</i>

22:43.945 --> 22:45.322
<i>Learn to stay calm.</i>

22:51.495 --> 22:54.748
[indistinct chatter]

23:07.594 --> 23:08.762
You got a minute?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.098
Yeah. Sure, Dex.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.601
Hey, give us a sec?

23:15.435 --> 23:16.436
They're...

23:17.229 --> 23:20.607
They're puttin' me on leave, Ray.
They're-- They're, uh...

23:20.690 --> 23:24.653
Hey, first thing you have to do
is take a breath, all right? [exhales]

23:25.278 --> 23:26.863
Everything's gonna be okay.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.950
Then look me in the eyes
when you say that.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.703
Hey, I'm on your side here.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.165
I can't get shut out, man.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.334
I need this job.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.295
Please.
There's gotta be something you can do.

23:42.879 --> 23:46.508
I made a point to commend your conduct
in my shooting report.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.135
[Mercer] <i>You see how alone you are?</i>

23:48.218 --> 23:50.595
<i>-It wasn't your fault.</i>
-[Ray continues inaudibly]

23:50.679 --> 23:54.057
[Mercer] <i>Dex, tell me...</i>
<i>What's making you scared?</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:56.518
<i>It's just you surrounded</i>
<i>by all this emptiness.</i>

23:56.601 --> 23:59.563
<i>-You see how alone you are?</i>
-You got nothing to worry about.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.320
[alarm, siren wailing in distance]

24:08.947 --> 24:10.907
[dog barks faintly]

24:50.530 --> 24:51.490
[glass breaking]

25:05.921 --> 25:08.256
[music playing on radio]

25:16.681 --> 25:17.891
You lost?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.602
Not if you're holding.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.686
[man] You a cop?

25:21.770 --> 25:25.482
[chuckles] Doesn't matter what I am.
I'm just looking for a couple of teeners.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.321
That'll be $80.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.494
And a crash.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.115
[woman on TV] <i>So we take here the paprika.</i>

26:15.657 --> 26:19.286
<i>And it's a smoked paprika.</i>
<i>We put it on the plate.</i>

26:19.369 --> 26:22.872
<i>And I will be adding to it</i>
<i>tomatoes and a bit of...</i>

26:49.441 --> 26:50.442
Hey. Hey, uh...

26:54.738 --> 26:58.908
you point me towards, uh, Jasper Evans,
this is yours.

27:00.493 --> 27:01.995
[Jasper] What the hell's it to you?

27:08.668 --> 27:09.836
Everybody out.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.256
Get out!

27:16.801 --> 27:18.219
Jasper Evans?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.724
[gasps]

27:35.612 --> 27:36.613
Sit down.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.705
[panting] You okay?

27:49.709 --> 27:50.710
Okay.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.921
So you knew his last known address?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.757
You knew he'd probably be here, so what...

27:56.925 --> 27:58.802
what were you waiting for?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.096
For me?

28:03.973 --> 28:05.308
You knew I'd come?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.561
I hoped.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.982
Okay, look, I'm gonna help you.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.067
But...

28:15.110 --> 28:17.028
after that,
I need you to help Foggy and me.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.698
Look, the FBI are all over us--

28:19.781 --> 28:21.408
You want me to turn myself in.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.995
-Did you talk to Foggy?
-No. But, uh...

28:26.996 --> 28:28.206
it's the smart move.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.501
Sure, I'll do it.

28:32.168 --> 28:35.380
But what if they figured out
that you're... you?

28:35.922 --> 28:38.842
Well, this mask doesn't do me any good
if I'm a wanted man, either way.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.011
Besides, if the FBI figured out who I am,

28:42.804 --> 28:45.390
who knows, maybe I'll get lucky
and they'll lock me up next to Fisk.

28:45.473 --> 28:46.474
[chuckles]

28:48.059 --> 28:49.144
Jesus.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.189
Foggy said you were... different.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.651
Changed, I guess.
I told him it was bullshit.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.737
All right, look,
we can't take his statement here. Fisk's lawyers will say it was coerced.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.992
Yeah, no, we take him to the <i>Bulletin.</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:06.035
We get him on record
in front of witnesses.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.538
Besides, my editor's gonna wanna hear this
with his own ears.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.873
Wake up, Evans.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.292
[Jasper groans]

29:12.959 --> 29:14.836
It's your lucky day.
I'm gonna give you a choice.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.838
Option one: I call the FBI...

29:17.756 --> 29:18.965
and Wilson Fisk has you killed

29:19.048 --> 29:20.967
before you can tell 'em
how you got out of prison.

29:21.050 --> 29:24.345
Option two: you tell this nice reporter
the truth about what you did for Fisk

29:24.429 --> 29:26.598
and I'll let you run someplace
Fisk will never find you.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.641
-[Jasper] I can't.
-Cool. Option one.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.393
No, if I talk, Fisk kills my son!

29:33.188 --> 29:34.230
Look at this place.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.608
I grew up here.

29:36.691 --> 29:40.528
We had a good life before the neighborhood
went down and I got myself put away.

29:41.112 --> 29:45.200
I left my son without a father.
And this is what he does with his life.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.702
If I go back inside,

29:48.286 --> 29:51.247
it won't be long until
he's sharin' a cell with me or worse.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.296
If Fisk stays out of prison,

29:59.047 --> 30:01.174
a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

30:01.257 --> 30:06.012
So you can either tell my paper the truth
and we let you and your son run far away

30:06.638 --> 30:07.931
or you can go back to prison

30:08.014 --> 30:09.724
and I print the story
like you talked anyway. You would lie and get us both killed?

30:14.521 --> 30:15.605
Your choice.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.157
Special Agent Nadeem.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.701
Mr. Nelson.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.247
I'm glad to see you've reconsidered.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.376
The sandwich you ordered last night.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.881
I'm here to represent Matt Murdock,
as his attorney.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.469
So when I asked
if you knew where Murdock was--

30:46.553 --> 30:49.013
I didn't lie. Matt contacted me today.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.391
My client's ready
to submit to questioning.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.476
That's fantastic.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.395
So, uh...

30:56.521 --> 30:57.605
where is he?

30:57.689 --> 30:59.607
I'll provide him to you tonight.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.485
After you hear the statement
of a second witness

31:02.569 --> 31:04.654
who will convince you
of my client's innocence.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.781
It sounds like I'm being jerked around,
counselor.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.826
His name is Jasper Evans.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.495
And you're really gonna wanna hear
what he has to say.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.431
Hallelujah.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.184
So you can dress
like a normal human being.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.478
Clean socks.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.606
Thank you.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.691
Well, it warms my heart

31:41.774 --> 31:45.445
to see you going out to do something
other than beat someone up.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.282
How do you know?

31:50.450 --> 31:52.702
Could just be adding style to my beatings.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.787
Did you...

31:55.705 --> 31:57.206
Did you just make a joke?

31:58.416 --> 32:02.253
You look ready to smile,
which I'm sure in your case means...

32:03.755 --> 32:07.383
Well, I don't know what that could mean,
as I've never actually seen one.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.472
This have something to do with the blond
who came to visit me today?

32:14.223 --> 32:15.224
Karen.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.605
Yeah. Yeah, I'm meeting her.

32:20.688 --> 32:21.689
[Maggie] Wow.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.067
She's lovely.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.736
She is.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.572
She knows you're Daredevil.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.741
She does.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.284
And she stuck around?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.245
-Sounds like a keeper.
-[chuckles]

32:37.038 --> 32:38.539
We're just friends.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.126
Well, it's nice to hear
you use the F-word.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.461
[Matt chuckles softly]

32:45.004 --> 32:48.174
And to see you reconnecting.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.342
Wait, I'm...

32:52.136 --> 32:54.514
She's just helping me one last time.

32:55.515 --> 32:56.933
It's not a criticism, Matthew.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.227
Calling you an idiot...

33:00.061 --> 33:03.314
for believing that friends
make you weaker rather than stronger?

33:03.398 --> 33:04.983
That would be a criticism.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.568
[chuckles] Thank you for clarifying that.

33:08.236 --> 33:11.072
Anyway, where are you off to?

33:12.115 --> 33:14.367
Gotta turn myself in to the FBI.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.785
You must be joking.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.662
You need a suit for that?

33:17.745 --> 33:19.914
I've been falsely accused.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.000
Gotta clear my name.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.794
You mean Matt Murdock's name.

33:24.877 --> 33:27.296
If you're leaving him behind,
why does it matter?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.467
My life is complicated enough
without being a wanted fugitive.

33:33.469 --> 33:37.557
And there are... other people involved.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.725
Other people?

33:39.976 --> 33:41.477
You mean your friends?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.995
So you've heard? Congratulations, Ray.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.497
-What?
-You were right.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.916
Your work with Fisk
trumped your credit issues.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.002
The EAD approved your promotion.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.213
Wow, I, uh...

34:10.298 --> 34:12.341
-Wow.
-That's not why you're here?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.642
Murdock's lawyer just promised
to surrender him tonight.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.353
That's great.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.983
But only after we hear from a witness
he claims can exonerate Murdock

34:29.067 --> 34:31.235
and prove that Fisk has been playing us.

34:32.945 --> 34:33.988
He's bullshitting.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.949
Yeah, well,
he claims his witness is Jasper Evans.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.367
Why do I know that name?

34:39.368 --> 34:40.953
He's the guy that shanked Fisk.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.539
That proves
Murdock's attorney is bullshitting.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.084
Evans isn't giving any statements.
He's in the hole.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.418
Actually, he's not.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.588
I just got off the phone with the warden.

34:50.671 --> 34:51.923
Evans is missing.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.841
What do you mean he's missing?

34:53.925 --> 34:56.928
I mean, they've searched the prison
top to bottom and he's not there.

34:57.804 --> 34:58.930
Jesus.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.351
If Murdock's attorney has him...

35:04.060 --> 35:07.897
you don't think he's right
about what Evans can prove?

35:09.273 --> 35:10.650
How can he be?

35:11.234 --> 35:14.654
Fisk's intel checks out,
and we're watching him 24/7.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.907
-We'd know if he was playing us.
-Right.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.118
So it's a bluff.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.497
It's a bluff.

35:35.591 --> 35:36.843
[exhales]

35:53.985 --> 35:56.487
[Julie] <i>Suicide Prevention,</i>
<i>this is Julie...</i>

35:57.280 --> 36:01.742
<i>Tell me, Dex, are you thinking</i>
<i>about taking your own life right now?</i>

36:01.826 --> 36:03.286
<i>How are you going to do it, Dex?</i>

36:05.037 --> 36:06.164
<i>Do you have a gun?</i>

36:06.247 --> 36:07.456
[Mercer] <i>Learn to stay calm.</i>

36:07.540 --> 36:10.001
-[Julie] <i>Is it in your hand?</i>
<i>-</i>[Mercer] <i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

36:10.084 --> 36:12.044
[Julie] <i>The world doesn't want you.</i>

36:12.128 --> 36:14.130
<i>I don't want you.</i>

36:14.881 --> 36:16.507
[Mercer] <i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

36:16.591 --> 36:18.134
<i>Learn to stay calm.</i>

36:18.217 --> 36:20.970
[Julie] <i>Do you have a gun?</i>
<i>You know where to press it.</i>

36:21.053 --> 36:22.680
[Mercer] <i>You see how alone you are?</i> [Julie] <i>You know where to press it.</i>

36:24.473 --> 36:27.310
-[breathing heavily]
-[cell phone ringing]

36:30.354 --> 36:32.106
[ringing continues]

36:45.703 --> 36:46.704
Hello?

36:47.788 --> 36:51.959
[Fisk on phone] <i>When I was in prison,</i>
<i>my mother passed away.</i>

36:53.461 --> 36:57.673
<i>Among her effects was a shoebox</i>
<i>with my name on it.</i>

36:58.841 --> 37:01.052
<i>A keepsake box of sorts.</i>

37:01.844 --> 37:05.556
<i>It was full of happy relics from my life.</i>

37:05.640 --> 37:09.268
<i>The gifts that I made her</i>
<i>when I was young.</i>

37:10.019 --> 37:12.104
<i>The odd news clipping.</i>

37:12.855 --> 37:14.023
<i>And the hammer.</i>

37:14.106 --> 37:17.193
The instrument of my father's death.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.654
I thought that she had thrown it away.

37:22.990 --> 37:26.535
But she was proud of what I had done,
of who I was.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.542
She accepted me, without shame.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.795
<i>And that's what I want for you.</i>

37:36.671 --> 37:39.173
<i>Someone to accept you, without shame.</i>

37:40.174 --> 37:41.259
<i>I do.</i>

37:42.927 --> 37:47.306
<i>And I've sent you a gift,</i>
<i>an opportunity to become your true self.</i>

37:48.140 --> 37:49.642
<i>And if you accept this...</i>

37:50.351 --> 37:55.481
<i>unlike everyone in your life,</i>
<i>I will never abandon you.</i>

37:56.607 --> 37:58.317
The decision is yours.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.530
[phone beeps]

38:09.996 --> 38:11.831
[breathing heavily]

38:11.914 --> 38:13.291
-[sniffs]
-[knock on door]

38:32.393 --> 38:35.730
A car is waiting, sir,
if you care to come with me.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.801
[both chuckle]

39:10.222 --> 39:13.726
[Matt] I wanted to put some money in it,
but I'm a little bit behind on my rent.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.481
[Foggy] Are you sure you wanna do this?

39:19.065 --> 39:21.609
You confident this FBI agent
can be trusted?

39:22.234 --> 39:25.696
Nadeem's a ball breaker, but he seems
genuinely interested in the truth.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.449
Yeah. I trust him.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.621
Then, yeah, I'm sure.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.915
[indistinct chatter] So, I got your message. [clears throat]

39:48.260 --> 39:50.221
Why am I missing my wife's office party?

39:50.304 --> 39:53.474
This is Jasper Evans.
He's here to go on record.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.519
He's the inmate
who shanked Wilson Fisk in prison.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.729
Fisk made me do it.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.482
We just got the call.
Murdock's at the <i>Bulletin.</i>

40:01.565 --> 40:02.608
What about Jasper Evans?

40:02.691 --> 40:03.692
Nelson didn't say,

40:03.776 --> 40:06.904
but doing this at the newspaper
means they want it as public as possible.

40:06.987 --> 40:09.907
Get Murdock
and find out what the hell is going on.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.451
The publisher and the lawyers
want it all on tape.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.995
Just tell the truth,
you'll be outta here soon.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.082
Just, uh, give me a minute.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.257
-I know you told me lay off Fisk, but...
-All right, look--

40:26.340 --> 40:28.259
-[Karen] We owe this to Ben.
-Stop, stop, stop.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.720
I owe you... an apology.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.932
Someone has gotta shine a light on this.

40:35.015 --> 40:39.937
And, well, I'm grateful that you were
brave enough to make me do it, so...

40:41.272 --> 40:42.690
thank you.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.068
Lead on.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.579
What is it?

40:59.248 --> 41:00.458
Do you hear something?

41:01.083 --> 41:02.126
Screaming.

41:04.670 --> 41:05.880
[Karen] <i>Please state your name.</i>

41:05.963 --> 41:08.340
-My name is Jasper Evans.
-[Karen] Good.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.927
Now, can you tell us
how you know Wilson Fisk?

41:14.430 --> 41:15.681
What the hell's going on?

41:18.601 --> 41:21.812
-[indistinct yelling]
-[screaming in distance]

41:22.396 --> 41:23.898
Foggy, find Karen. Get her outta here.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.775
Oh, shit. This is not happening.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.404
[man 1] Great, another power outage.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.573
[man 2] Genny's kicked in.
At least our work is saved.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.825
[woman] Probably another fire drill
no one told us about.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.036
[man 3] That's weird.
The phones are out, too.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.496
Hey, you can't be here!

41:38.579 --> 41:41.207
[grunts, groans]

41:41.832 --> 41:43.584
[woman screaming]

41:52.968 --> 41:54.970
[man grunting]

41:58.933 --> 42:00.768
[Ellison] Karen? What is it?

42:02.102 --> 42:03.103
What's wrong?

42:20.996 --> 42:23.374
-[Mercer] <i>We prepared for this.</i>
<i>-</i>[Julie]<i> Let go of me, Dex.</i>

42:23.457 --> 42:25.334
<i>I said let go!</i>

42:25.417 --> 42:29.755
[Fisk] <i>Fashioned yourself into something</i>
<i>the world will tolerate!</i>

42:29.838 --> 42:31.173
[Mercer] <i>It's just you.</i>

42:32.466 --> 42:34.635
[Dex] <i>People like you. Like us.</i>

42:36.512 --> 42:37.763
<i>The real you.</i>

43:42.077 --> 43:43.787
-Karen!
-[exhales] Jesus.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.625
Who are you?

43:49.335 --> 43:50.711
I'm Daredevil.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.299
[both grunting]

45:22.219 --> 45:24.430
[panting]

45:40.779 --> 45:41.613
[grunts] [groans]

45:59.256 --> 46:01.717
[both grunting]

46:43.342 --> 46:44.676
[Matt groans]

46:53.352 --> 46:55.562
[Dex panting]

47:01.985 --> 47:04.446
[sirens blaring in distance]

47:22.047 --> 47:23.215
Stop or I'll--

47:23.298 --> 47:24.216
Ahh!

47:27.553 --> 47:29.596
[Ellison] The hell are you do-- [grunts]

47:53.704 --> 47:56.748
Hello, Karen. It's nice to see you again.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.343
[gasping]

48:14.683 --> 48:16.143
Did anyone see what happened?

48:19.313 --> 48:21.189
Check 'em. You two, with me!

48:26.612 --> 48:28.196
[Matt groaning]

48:33.327 --> 48:34.411
[door opens]

48:35.537 --> 48:38.332
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Matt?

48:39.207 --> 48:41.293
Jesus Christ.

48:42.127 --> 48:44.129
[both panting]

48:49.051 --> 48:50.052
Foggy?

48:50.844 --> 48:52.763
No, no, no. He's okay. He's okay.

48:54.139 --> 48:55.474
[gasping] Jesus, are you? [Matt] Did he kill Jasper?

49:02.314 --> 49:03.315
[Karen] Yeah.

49:06.610 --> 49:07.736
Yeah.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.280
I don't, uh...

49:11.615 --> 49:12.741
[Matt stammers]

49:28.757 --> 49:30.133
[Ray] FBI, don't move!

49:53.824 --> 49:55.826
Agents down! Agents down!

49:57.995 --> 49:59.121
FBI!

50:00.580 --> 50:01.957
FBI, nobody move!

50:13.176 --> 50:15.178
[printing presses whirring]

50:57.304 --> 50:58.138
[grunts]

51:01.058 --> 51:02.726
[groaning]

51:36.510 --> 51:38.512
[officers shouting in distance]

51:55.153 --> 51:56.571
[officer] What the hell happened?

51:57.572 --> 51:58.824
Who did this?

52:06.331 --> 52:07.749
It was Daredevil.
