WEBVTT

00:01.850 --> 00:06.970
What's the gig? From now on, you'll be
investigating the second coming of Christ.

00:07.130 --> 00:10.290
She's my birth mother.
She tells me I have a twin.

00:10.450 --> 00:12.690
If I can find him,
I can find Layla.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.130
I kind of escaped.

00:14.290 --> 00:16.730
You can't tell me that.
I'm in the White House!

00:21.530 --> 00:24.170
Yeah, this gonna be fun.
Like Driving Miss Daisy,

00:24.330 --> 00:27.650
although without all that civil
rights bullshit. Shut up!

00:28.930 --> 00:30.290
Hey, Ariel.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.450
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't

00:33.570 --> 00:35.730
rip your balls off.

00:42.770 --> 00:47.650
* I can see clearly now
the rain has gone... *

00:50.090 --> 00:51.810
See that?

00:51.970 --> 00:54.690
That's what's going to kill
everyone...

00:54.810 --> 00:56.650
any second now.

00:56.770 --> 00:59.170
Doesn't matter who you are,

00:59.330 --> 01:03.530
who you pray to, black or white,
straight or gay, rich or poor.

01:07.730 --> 01:11.650
Yup, it's Judgment Day,
the actual apocalypse.

01:11.770 --> 01:13.050
And where am I?

01:13.170 --> 01:16.770
In Slough, or rather under Slough,

01:16.890 --> 01:18.250
watching it on telly.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.690
'One minute now.

01:19.850 --> 01:23.170
'One minute. These pictures coming
live to us from Hubble...'

01:23.330 --> 01:26.970
I know what you're thinking, "Cheer
up, you're one of the lucky ones!"

01:27.130 --> 01:31.650
My question is, am I? I mean have you
seen who else is in here?

01:34.530 --> 01:37.130
Who are these people?

01:37.250 --> 01:39.570
How the hell did this happen?

01:39.730 --> 01:44.130
Are WE the future of mankind?
I mean, seriously?

01:44.290 --> 01:46.970
'Thank you all for watching.
I hope we'll meet again.'

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:56.330 --> 02:00.290
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Operation Saviour.

02:00.450 --> 02:04.290
Our work here is secret so I'll now
require you to surrender all

02:04.450 --> 02:07.490
devices that allow contact
with the outside world.

02:07.650 --> 02:11.610
No-one tweets, blogs,
or sends carrier pigeons.

02:11.770 --> 02:14.450
Now, you may be
the world's finest minds,

02:14.610 --> 02:18.490
but there's no point in dreaming
unachievable dreams.

02:18.650 --> 02:23.370
We need to use existing technology,
existing weaponry.

02:23.490 --> 02:25.970
So, be realistic.

02:26.130 --> 02:30.770
'Compromise.
We report to the UN in two days.

02:30.930 --> 02:34.330
'Timescale will dictate
our approach...'

02:34.450 --> 02:35.690
I'm his uncle.

02:38.970 --> 02:43.850
I know it's chaos out there
but any sign,

02:43.970 --> 02:46.090
give me a call, please.

02:52.530 --> 02:57.250
'We believe that the video proves
McNeil is part of a larger

02:57.410 --> 03:02.650
'terrorist network. We now believe
she's armed and dangerous,

03:02.810 --> 03:06.010
'and poses a significant threat
to national-security.

03:06.170 --> 03:09.370
'We are therefore asking people
to remain vigilant.

03:09.530 --> 03:14.650
'If you see her,
please call 911 immediately...'

03:16.330 --> 03:21.330
Is this really necessary?
Girl, we're wearing prison uniforms.

03:22.610 --> 03:26.890
OK, what's the plan?
Oh. Um... Well, let me think.

03:27.050 --> 03:29.410
I'll take the guards out
with my nunchackus,

03:29.570 --> 03:31.490
while you disable
the motion sensors.

03:31.650 --> 03:34.290
- Does that sound good, Batman?
- What's the plan

03:34.450 --> 03:37.490
The plan is run over there
and grab as many of those goddamn

03:37.650 --> 03:39.810
clothes as you can without
getting caught!

03:39.970 --> 03:42.530
It's going to take us a week
just to get to my place. A week?

03:42.690 --> 03:45.050
I thought we were talking,
like, one or two days!

03:45.210 --> 03:47.530
Now, how do you think
we're going to do that? Huh?

03:47.690 --> 03:50.090
We gotta dump cars
every few hours,

03:50.210 --> 03:51.970
stick to the back roads. Adds up!

03:52.090 --> 03:54.290
Tennessee is only halfway for me.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.450
I have got to get to Spike
before Ariel does.

03:57.610 --> 04:01.210
Well, that ain't going to happen
at all if you get caught now, is it?

04:06.890 --> 04:10.850
No, please, you've got it all wrong.
I'm not who you think I am.

04:10.970 --> 04:14.530
What's the magic word, Ariel?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.370
I don't know because I'm not Ariel!

04:18.529 --> 04:23.050
I'm Jamie. I'm his twin.
I'm just trying to find my wife.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.970
I think he has her!

04:25.130 --> 04:27.610
I'm hoping that my birth mother
knows where he is.

04:27.770 --> 04:30.410
Her name is Mary and she abandoned
be when I was a baby,

04:30.570 --> 04:32.930
and this is the only address
I have for her...

04:33.090 --> 04:35.170
You really haven't changed,
have you?

04:35.290 --> 04:38.450
Everything is still a lie.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.090
Crap.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.970
Hilda, what is it, boy?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.570
Leave them rabbits alone!

04:58.690 --> 05:01.090
Oh, oh, hello, puppy.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.970
It's OK. It's OK...

05:03.170 --> 05:06.570
Oh, my God! How many toys
does this dog have!

05:08.210 --> 05:10.770
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Good dog...

05:12.730 --> 05:14.250
Hilda, scram!

05:17.730 --> 05:19.450
Don't you move a muscle, missy.

05:20.770 --> 05:26.010
Now, once again,
what is the magic word?

05:28.090 --> 05:29.770
I don't...

05:29.890 --> 05:31.650
See?

05:31.810 --> 05:35.250
It is you because only you could
have done what you did

05:35.410 --> 05:39.050
and still not know the word I want
to hear. Make the magic word sorry.

05:39.210 --> 05:42.810
Is it? OK. I'm sorry, then.
"I'm sorry, THEN?"

05:42.930 --> 05:44.210
Fuck you.

05:44.370 --> 05:50.810
You know, I vowed one day I'd see
you grovel. Now do it, properly.

05:51.930 --> 05:54.170
Sorry. No, not feeling it.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.010
I'm really sorry.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.850
A little more humility. From the
bottom of my heart. Ariel...

05:59.010 --> 06:01.930
I apologise from the bottom
of my heart sorry, sorry, sorry!

06:02.090 --> 06:05.050
Go on, nail him. She's not going to
do it. I can see it in her eyes.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.730
Whoa!

06:07.850 --> 06:11.050
OK, no, listen, that was my bad.
I misjudged that.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.570
This wasn't supposed to happen...

06:28.450 --> 06:30.450
Is that what I think it is?

06:33.690 --> 06:36.690
Please don't call the police, sir.
I'm not a bad person.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.810
Yeah? Why are you in prison, then,
huh? My son made a mistake.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.210
He broke in somewhere where that
he shouldn't, and I took the blame.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.970
My ass. No, it's true.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.290
The only thing I'm guilty of
is bad parenting!

06:48.410 --> 06:50.290
God knows I tried.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.210
Oh, God. I can't go back to jail.

06:53.370 --> 06:56.890
I'm so afraid to die alone in there.
I just want to be with my family.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.130
You can understand that, can't you?

07:00.770 --> 07:02.690
'Are you kidding me, Father?'

07:02.810 --> 07:04.330
Is this some kind of joke?

07:04.490 --> 07:07.970
Believe me, the minute the airlines
get their act back together,

07:08.090 --> 07:10.010
we are back in economy.

07:10.170 --> 07:13.330
Until then,
welcome to Pope Force One.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.570
Our first case. That's exciting.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.050
What's wrong?

07:25.330 --> 07:27.530
Nothing, I just never flew before.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.210
Really? You're kidding.

07:30.970 --> 07:32.370
That's adorable.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.210
If you get scared,
I'll let you hold my hand.

07:37.370 --> 07:41.530
That won't be necessary, thank you.
Really great research, by the way.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.250
I'm in danger
of looking professional.

07:44.410 --> 07:49.610
But in the future,
I will not need this,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.090
this...

07:52.970 --> 07:54.690
..and that.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.050
We have 32 days.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.370
If you spend that kind of energy
on each case,

07:58.490 --> 08:00.010
you're going to be burnt out.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.530
But the medical evidence...

08:01.690 --> 08:05.170
Celine, I love your love
of the rational,

08:05.330 --> 08:07.810
but you get that
we're beyond that now.

08:07.930 --> 08:10.010
We're investigating false messiahs.

08:12.530 --> 08:15.090
Or little giraffe girls.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.890
But if people are willing
to believe this crap,

08:18.050 --> 08:20.850
do you really think they can engage
in a rational debate?

08:21.010 --> 08:24.770
They can't.
So we fight fire with fire.

08:24.930 --> 08:29.770
So we are just digging up dirt,
like Tabloid X and sleaze?

08:29.890 --> 08:32.650
Celine, in the real world,

08:32.770 --> 08:36.049
this is always about money or sex.

08:36.169 --> 08:38.770
And when it comes to the devout,

08:38.890 --> 08:40.970
99% of the time, it's about sex.

08:41.090 --> 08:42.929
It's a fact.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.010
No, this is nonsense.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.370
Sex is a natural urge.

08:49.530 --> 08:54.850
And you put a lid on that,
it seeps out the sides,

08:55.010 --> 08:58.170
in unexpected and sometimes
spectacular ways.

08:58.290 --> 09:01.490
Well, I put a lid on it. I'm OK.

09:01.610 --> 09:05.170
What? I am. You took the vows, too.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.730
Yes, but that was different.

09:07.890 --> 09:11.650
I was young and I had plenty of time
to get it out of my system.

09:11.770 --> 09:14.570
But if you've never done it,

09:14.730 --> 09:16.850
it's much easier
for it to become a hang-up.

09:33.570 --> 09:34.770
Give us the key.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.570
If you let us out,
we can drive you to the hospital.

09:39.690 --> 09:41.930
Why should I trust you, though?

09:42.090 --> 09:47.010
Because, A, I'm not Ariel, and, B,
you still hold the trump card.

09:47.130 --> 09:50.050
You know where Mary is. I don't.

09:50.210 --> 09:53.450
Or you know, you could just
do this on your own.

09:53.610 --> 09:56.130
How's that working out
for you so far?

10:12.130 --> 10:14.410
Don't worry. It suits you.

10:32.690 --> 10:35.370
OK, I see your point.
We have moved beyond reason.

11:00.930 --> 11:02.610
Zamowilam nam wisite.

11:05.690 --> 11:08.130
So, you've been busy?

11:08.250 --> 11:11.610
Yes. Last 48 hours have been crazy.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.530
Many suicides.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.850
So, tell us about Jane Doe.

11:19.010 --> 11:24.530
Approximately six years old, speaks
English, but won't tell us her name.

11:24.690 --> 11:27.330
She was in car crash
two nights ago with woman

11:27.490 --> 11:31.170
we assume is mother, but no ID.
So who knows?

11:31.330 --> 11:35.250
And she was dead when she arrived?
Yes, I examined her myself.

11:35.370 --> 11:36.970
Sent body down here.

11:38.290 --> 11:39.850
Tomasz was on shift.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.570
He put her in the draw.

11:43.730 --> 11:46.450
An hour later, they are announcing
the end of world on TV

11:46.570 --> 11:48.290
when he hears the screams.

11:48.450 --> 11:51.890
No, ja prawie zesralem sie
z tego wszystkiego.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.890
What's he saying?

11:54.010 --> 11:56.490
He say he nearly shit himself.

11:56.610 --> 11:58.410
Oh. It's understandable.

12:10.210 --> 12:14.090
So, there's no way you both
could have made a mistake?

12:14.210 --> 12:15.890
I'm just asking.

12:16.010 --> 12:18.730
And the nurse sent the first tweet?

12:18.890 --> 12:23.010
Suddenly, it was all over
the internet. People do the math.

12:23.170 --> 12:27.410
Resurrection plus Apocalypse
equals second coming.

12:27.530 --> 12:30.570
This mob is come for its Messiah.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.250
OK, where is your car?
What? I thought you had one!

12:40.410 --> 12:42.970
You said you'd drive me!

12:43.090 --> 12:44.650
OK, don't worry.

12:44.810 --> 12:47.170
Give me back my phone.
I'll call an ambulance.

12:47.330 --> 12:50.250
Oh, well done, genius. I wish
I'd thought of that. Oh, f...

12:50.370 --> 12:51.810
So, no ambulances?

12:51.970 --> 12:55.210
No, it's a six-hour wait.
They're short on crews.

12:55.370 --> 12:59.530
It's the end of the world, remember?
Hey, look, don't worry.

12:59.690 --> 13:02.210
I reckon I can do this.
I've seen Call The Midwife.

13:02.330 --> 13:04.370
It basically involves towelling.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.330
Quick word. What?

13:06.450 --> 13:08.170
We cannot deliver a baby!

13:08.330 --> 13:10.610
Yes, we can!
Positive mental attitude.

13:10.770 --> 13:14.370
I don't think that's enough. I think
you need training and skills.

13:14.530 --> 13:18.250
Can someone get over here and help
me take my knickers off! Boom.

13:18.370 --> 13:20.170
Bucket list phrase right there.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.850
Admittedly, in my head
it was slightly sexier.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.890
Look, she is terrified.

13:25.050 --> 13:28.490
For her sake, we need to look
confident. Swans, yeah?

13:28.650 --> 13:32.050
You know, swans, calm up top even
if down below's all, like, "Help!"

13:32.170 --> 13:33.810
Swans.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.530
Great.

13:35.650 --> 13:37.850
'You know what's depressing here?'

13:38.010 --> 13:42.130
This may be the culmination
of mankind.

13:42.290 --> 13:47.410
Our finest minds, pinnacle of our
civilisation, and look at them.

13:47.570 --> 13:50.130
Even now we still
can't work together.

13:52.730 --> 13:55.410
Maybe we deserve to die out.

13:57.730 --> 13:59.410
And Scotty?

14:02.530 --> 14:04.370
Scotty?

14:04.490 --> 14:06.530
You still look like crap.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.090
Have you slept?

14:10.130 --> 14:12.450
You gotta look after yourself.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.490
This is a marathon, not a sprint.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.650
We haven't even started
on the other thing.

14:20.090 --> 14:24.770
Ariel, hold my hand. I still hate
you, but don't you dare leave.

14:24.930 --> 14:28.250
OK, I'm still not Ariel, but,
don't worry. I promise I won't leave.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.850
You're going to be fine...
Oh, for the love of God! What?

14:31.970 --> 14:33.850
I mean, talk about design flaw.

14:34.010 --> 14:38.890
No, we're going to have to swap
ends, mate. Swans, yeah? Brilliant.

14:39.050 --> 14:42.010
She took you hostage, yet,
somehow, I'm the bad guy?

14:50.210 --> 14:51.730
Agh!

14:51.850 --> 14:54.250
I can't believe I gave birth to that.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.170
How did he get so big?

14:57.410 --> 15:00.090
Anyway, that's Spike.

15:03.210 --> 15:07.810
God, I love him, but has he got
a mouth on him

15:07.970 --> 15:13.170
Oh, knows it all,
loves to tell you your every mistake.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.530
Wouldn't have lasted five
minutes in juvey, huh? Exactly!

15:20.570 --> 15:22.730
Thank you for not calling the police.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.490
I really appreciate it.

15:27.570 --> 15:29.330
Can I ask you a question?

15:31.050 --> 15:32.730
Whose clothes are these?

15:36.730 --> 15:37.930
Mine.

15:39.490 --> 15:40.970
I...

15:42.890 --> 15:45.330
Well, I like to dress like a lady.

15:47.890 --> 15:52.410
I'm 46 years old and I've never
told no-one that before.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.410
Round here,
that ain't something you tell.

15:58.370 --> 16:01.930
I guess I'm just tired of living
scared. Too late in the day.

16:02.050 --> 16:04.210
We could all be dead soon.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.490
So, this is me -

16:07.650 --> 16:10.610
just a regular Joe
who likes wearing pantyhose.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.850
That bother you?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.970
No. Not at all.

16:20.090 --> 16:21.930
In that case...

16:23.450 --> 16:25.170
..would you mind if I go change?

16:26.890 --> 16:29.530
Just once in my life,
I would like to be myself.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.250
Too slutty.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.290
Too formal.

16:45.450 --> 16:49.530
Excuse me, sir. Could I use
your phone? Help yourself.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.770
You are gorgeous.

16:55.530 --> 16:59.130
'..leaving no doubt that
the attack on the NSA

16:59.290 --> 17:04.130
'was part of a wider campaign
to destabilise the US interests...'

17:04.250 --> 17:06.849
'Hey, you got Spike's voicemail.

17:06.970 --> 17:08.410
'Hit me on the...'

17:08.569 --> 17:12.609
Honey, it's Mom.
Listen. This is important.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.490
There's a man called Ariel.

17:14.650 --> 17:17.089
He also calls himself
the White Horse.

17:17.250 --> 17:21.530
I think he's trying to find you,
but do not trust him. OK?

17:22.890 --> 17:26.650
God. I wish you would answer
the phone, just once.

17:28.170 --> 17:32.530
Give me it. Give me my phone,
you drunk.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.010
My house, my rules.

17:35.170 --> 17:40.210
No phones, no TV, no internet,
till you do your chores.

17:40.370 --> 17:45.410
Now, I asked you to empty
the crapper, and you didn't, so...

17:45.530 --> 17:46.970
Don't you dare.

17:47.090 --> 17:48.810
I forbid you.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.290
Why are you such a asshole?

17:53.450 --> 17:57.050
Don't ever talk to me like that.
I'm your father.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.730
No, you're not. Rajesh is.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.530
Not according to the judge.

18:17.370 --> 18:19.730
McNeil. 'It's me.
Did you find Spike?'

18:21.130 --> 18:24.370
'Um... Not yet.'
What do you mean not yet?

18:24.530 --> 18:27.730
Look, I'm sure there's
no need to panic,

18:27.890 --> 18:30.850
'but they're not at the address
on the custody papers.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.130
'Tim gave a false address.'
So Spike's missing?

18:34.250 --> 18:36.370
Scotty, you have to find him.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.210
How? What do you want me to do?

18:39.370 --> 18:44.210
I'm doing what I can, OK?
But this is a bad time.

18:44.370 --> 18:46.610
Work is kind of crazy...
'I don't care!'

18:46.770 --> 18:48.930
This is your nephew!
This is family!

18:49.090 --> 18:51.890
What could possibly be more
important than this?

18:52.050 --> 18:55.490
I can't tell you that. 'Oh, my God.
You are unbelievable.'

18:55.650 --> 18:58.450
Tell me at least that you spoke
with Rajesh.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.330
Scotty!

19:00.450 --> 19:02.810
It's on my list. OK?

19:02.930 --> 19:05.010
But look, there's something else.

19:05.130 --> 19:06.850
'You are all over the news.

19:07.010 --> 19:09.290
'Some guy posted a video
on the web this morning

19:09.450 --> 19:12.930
'and he says that you're a terrorist
helping him wage war on America!'

19:13.050 --> 19:14.410
You're not, are you?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.050
Scotty, I'm a librarian.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.210
'Well, why is he saying it?'

19:18.370 --> 19:21.410
Cos he's a publicity-seeking prick
who hates me.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.250
'And I think he's trying
to find Spike,

19:24.450 --> 19:27.890
'so me getting recaptured
suits him...'

19:29.170 --> 19:30.370
Scotty?

19:31.650 --> 19:32.890
Scotty?

19:35.730 --> 19:37.450
I trusted you.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.170
You lied to me.

19:45.110 --> 19:48.910
How about a joke? Do you like jokes?
Cos I have a great joke.

19:49.070 --> 19:51.710
Why did the monk leave
the monastery?

19:51.830 --> 19:54.030
Because he was cloister-phobic.

19:55.950 --> 19:57.990
No? OK.

19:58.150 --> 20:01.470
Well, you'd laugh if you understood
monastic architecture.

20:01.590 --> 20:03.830
Um... Gum?

20:03.990 --> 20:07.310
Do you like gum?
Jude, it's got nicotine.

20:09.910 --> 20:13.830
OK, kid, you're killing us.
Can you say something?

20:13.990 --> 20:16.710
My mom told me
not to talk to men like you.

20:16.830 --> 20:20.110
She says you're perverts. Oh.

20:20.270 --> 20:24.870
Well, maybe you will
talk to me, then? OK.

20:25.030 --> 20:27.910
What's a pervert?
Yeah, what's a pervert?

20:29.630 --> 20:31.590
Ah, goodness.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.190
Yes...

20:33.350 --> 20:37.430
It's a person who does things
in funny ways.

20:39.590 --> 20:43.990
Oh. Like a clown?
Yes, sort of like a clown.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.150
I know. Did you ever play thumb war?

20:47.270 --> 20:48.830
Here, give me your hand.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.830
One, two, three, four,

20:53.950 --> 20:56.630
I declare the thumb war.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.190
Now, my thumb chases yours, yes?

21:05.870 --> 21:09.910
Those people downstairs are funny,
aren't they? They're idiots.

21:10.070 --> 21:13.830
They think I'm going to save them.
Oh, but you're not?

21:13.990 --> 21:17.630
Of course not. I can't even cross
the road on my own yet.

21:17.790 --> 21:22.790
So, why do they say that?
They think I'm God's daughter. Wow.

21:22.910 --> 21:25.230
And are you? Of course not.

21:25.350 --> 21:28.670
She's my daughter. Come here. Mum!

21:28.830 --> 21:31.230
It's OK, Mummy's OK.
You're all right.

21:31.350 --> 21:32.790
You stay away from her.

21:36.870 --> 21:39.830
I wish I...had drugs!

21:39.950 --> 21:42.270
Why would anyone do this naturally?

21:43.710 --> 21:45.710
I think we're nearly there, OK?

21:49.110 --> 21:51.470
It's OK, I think we're nearly there.

21:53.830 --> 21:56.390
OK, this is the one.
This is the one! OK?

21:56.550 --> 21:59.750
I need you to push, push, push,
push, push, push, push.

21:59.870 --> 22:01.430
You can do it. This is it.

22:01.590 --> 22:04.990
That's it, that's it, push, push,
push, push, push!

22:24.230 --> 22:26.110
What's the...matter?

22:29.270 --> 22:31.670
(Breathe.

22:31.830 --> 22:37.630
(You know you want to. Come on,
come on. This world is not so bad.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.990
(There's still stuff
worth fighting for.

22:41.150 --> 22:44.150
(Yes, there is. There's still stuff
worth fighting for.

22:44.310 --> 22:46.830
(There's still stuff worth
fighting for.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.150
Oh, my God!

22:55.310 --> 22:59.390
That's it. You practice
using those lungs. OK.

23:07.070 --> 23:08.430
There's Mummy.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.630
My son.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.510
My little boy.

23:20.510 --> 23:23.870
He's awesome.
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

23:23.990 --> 23:27.550
It's not just me, is it? No.

23:30.550 --> 23:34.870
I don't... I don't know what to say.

23:36.150 --> 23:38.670
Thank you, thank you so much.

23:42.230 --> 23:44.270
Your hands are filthy.

23:47.110 --> 23:48.790
What happened to your thing?

23:50.790 --> 23:53.590
Your compulsive hand-washing thing?

23:54.790 --> 23:57.590
I told you, I'm not Ariel.

24:01.670 --> 24:03.390
Rajesh?

24:05.070 --> 24:07.110
Rajesh.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.430
Hey. Hey, buddy.

24:09.550 --> 24:12.270
Rhonda told me to come and see you.

24:12.430 --> 24:17.550
Sorry I didn't come earlier.
Work's been crazy. How's things?

24:18.790 --> 24:21.590
Well, I'm dying,

24:21.710 --> 24:24.030
my son's been taken

24:24.190 --> 24:28.510
and the TV says that my wife
is being hunted down like a dog.

24:30.030 --> 24:33.150
But other than that...great.

24:35.030 --> 24:37.230
By the way, we're being watched.

24:43.070 --> 24:46.270
Think he's a cop?
God, I shouldn't have come here.

24:46.430 --> 24:49.830
This was such a big mistake.
You're visiting your brother-in-law.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.870
It's the kind of thing
that normal people do.

24:55.350 --> 24:57.390
Now, what the hell is going on?

24:58.990 --> 25:01.190
She says she's coming back to DC.

25:02.430 --> 25:05.230
Tell her not to.
How could she be so dumb?

25:05.390 --> 25:08.150
Don't think that's quite
the reaction she's hoping for.

25:08.310 --> 25:10.590
Why do you think they're
watching me, huh?

25:11.670 --> 25:13.750
Look, I've got to get back to work.

25:13.870 --> 25:17.070
Scotty, this comet...

25:17.190 --> 25:18.990
is that you?

25:19.110 --> 25:22.870
No. What makes you say that?

25:28.470 --> 25:30.030
I can't talk about it.

25:30.190 --> 25:33.790
These scientists, is that just
a diversion to keep people calm?

25:36.110 --> 25:38.110
I'm not asking for me.

25:39.790 --> 25:43.230
I'm already dead.
But Rhonda needs to know.

25:46.910 --> 25:49.710
It's going to be fine.

25:49.830 --> 25:51.030
Promise.

25:54.510 --> 25:56.110
'Dr Hendrix to radiology.'

25:59.790 --> 26:01.990
I owe you guys a huge apology.

26:03.030 --> 26:04.510
I'm really sorry.

26:05.870 --> 26:08.910
Your brother really brings out
the worst in me.

26:09.070 --> 26:14.070
We grew up on the commune together.
He was my first love...sadly.

26:14.230 --> 26:16.950
Then he ran off with my best mate
when I was 18.

26:17.110 --> 26:19.550
Haven't seen him since till you
showed up.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.470
With your identical love rat face.

26:21.590 --> 26:23.950
I just wanted to get my own back.

26:24.110 --> 26:27.550
Like, shit him up a bit
for running off with Hawkwind.

26:29.190 --> 26:31.110
Listen, take my advice.

26:31.230 --> 26:32.710
Stay...

26:32.830 --> 26:34.510
away from him.

26:34.670 --> 26:37.630
Believe me, I would if I could,
but I need to find my wife.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.630
Is she in danger?

26:39.750 --> 26:41.550
Is he...dangerous?

26:41.670 --> 26:43.190
Um...

26:43.310 --> 26:45.470
Oh, shit! Shit!

26:45.630 --> 26:48.870
Right, calm down. You don't even
know if she's with him for definite.

26:49.030 --> 26:51.670
I can't help it.
I lost her for seven years

26:51.830 --> 26:54.430
and the thought of something bad
happening to her now

26:54.550 --> 26:56.190
makes me feel sick.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.070
I need her to be safe. I just...

26:59.190 --> 27:00.990
..need her to be safe.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.910
I've got to get out of Poland.
I'm fine.

27:09.910 --> 27:12.630
I just need to get her as far
from these freaks as possible.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.950
I repeat, I am not with the freaks.

27:16.230 --> 27:17.550
Yeah, yeah.

27:17.710 --> 27:20.630
You tell yourself that. You're just
a different bunch of freaks,

27:20.790 --> 27:23.310
buying a different load
of mystical bollocks.

27:25.030 --> 27:26.550
Who is that?

27:27.670 --> 27:29.550
My dad. He works in a bank.

27:29.670 --> 27:31.430
Ah, that's nice.

27:31.590 --> 27:35.030
And, er, who with this
going into his bank?

27:35.150 --> 27:37.390
Your friend, Sister Sophia.

27:40.710 --> 27:42.270
What did you say?

27:42.390 --> 27:44.510
Sophia, your friend that died.

27:44.670 --> 27:47.990
She says she's happy and she's
getting a lot of knitting done.

27:51.350 --> 27:52.550
But...

27:52.670 --> 27:54.470
How do you know this?

27:54.630 --> 27:57.710
Ever since waking up,
I hear this voice.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.710
It says I have to give you
a message.

28:00.870 --> 28:03.830
One day soon you are going to
see four horses -

28:03.950 --> 28:06.710
a white, a black, a red and a pale.

28:06.870 --> 28:10.190
It says when you see them, don't
panic. It's all part of the plan.

28:12.830 --> 28:14.750
Here. I want you to have this.

28:14.870 --> 28:17.230
I put where I live at the bottom.

28:17.390 --> 28:20.390
I don't think your mum
want anyone to know that.

28:20.550 --> 28:22.830
It's not for anyone,
it's just for you.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.670
How are you going to get out
of Poland?

28:27.790 --> 28:29.190
You are not fit to drive.

28:29.350 --> 28:31.190
There are no flights.
I have a plane.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.390
Look, you've got to get out
of here one way or the other.

28:35.550 --> 28:38.950
By the plane is a lot better than
wandering around on the streets.

28:39.110 --> 28:42.230
We'll put you in a cab, you can get
a hotel and rest up.

28:42.390 --> 28:44.830
And if something goes wrong,
you can call a doctor.

28:44.950 --> 28:46.670
Why are you being so nice?

28:46.790 --> 28:48.670
What do you want?

28:48.790 --> 28:50.190
Nothing.

28:50.350 --> 28:54.990
You see, that, quote, "mystical
bollocks" that I sell...

28:55.110 --> 28:57.430
..is actually big on helping people.

28:57.590 --> 29:00.710
Even when they're...acting like
fucking idiots.

29:02.510 --> 29:04.550
Are you really a priest?

29:04.710 --> 29:06.830
I believe in God, you don't,
it's fine.

29:06.990 --> 29:10.190
But I think we both know that your
daughter is not the Saviour.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.190
Let me help you.

29:16.550 --> 29:18.470
How do we get past the freaks?

29:20.390 --> 29:22.470
They are going to rip me apart.

29:22.590 --> 29:25.310
He's a little bit smug, but still.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.430
I mean, he would, right?

29:31.190 --> 29:33.630
# We're not coming knocking
at your door

29:33.790 --> 29:35.950
* Let me in and I'll tell
you some more... *

29:41.830 --> 29:44.550
I think we can safely say
it's a gonna, Spike.

29:44.670 --> 29:46.390
How do you know my name?

29:46.510 --> 29:48.830
Let's just say I'm a fan of yours.

29:48.950 --> 29:51.430
And a friend of your mother's.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.710
She...she speak to you today?

29:53.830 --> 29:55.310
Shame.

29:55.470 --> 29:58.670
She said she was going to call,
let you know we were coming.

29:58.790 --> 30:01.030
She sent you to get me out of here?

30:01.150 --> 30:02.630
Who are you?

30:02.750 --> 30:04.310
Can you keep a secret?

30:06.750 --> 30:08.470
They call me the White Horse.

30:08.590 --> 30:10.110
Shut up!

30:11.310 --> 30:13.830
The White Horse? As in Deus Ex?

30:13.950 --> 30:15.870
Oh, wow! Cool!

30:16.030 --> 30:20.590
Well, looks like we've got ourselves
a little mutual appreciation society.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.270
Are you coming or what?

30:28.910 --> 30:32.470
'The video reveals her as an enemy
of US interests.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.390
'With Rhonda McNeil back beside us,
we will...'

30:35.550 --> 30:38.030
He's lying, I'm not with them.
Save it for the cops.

30:39.430 --> 30:42.910
'Open your eyes, America,
there is no apocalypse.

30:43.030 --> 30:44.910
'They just want to control you.'

30:45.030 --> 30:46.550
If it's the reward you want...

30:46.670 --> 30:48.470
It's not about money.

30:48.590 --> 30:50.230
It's about right and wrong.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.030
Exactly. And that man is wrong.

30:53.630 --> 30:55.390
He wants my son.

30:55.550 --> 30:58.710
So it'd be real convenient
for him if I'm out of the way.

30:58.870 --> 31:01.070
You're helping him.
I trusted you.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.950
I took you in, fed you,
told you everything.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.390
I just wanted something real,
another human being.

31:09.510 --> 31:11.070
But you lied to me.

31:18.150 --> 31:19.950
Oh, please.

31:20.070 --> 31:22.310
Please, I'm begging you.

31:29.230 --> 31:31.470
She's in the bathroom.

31:31.630 --> 31:34.630
'Freeze and kneel or you are dead
meat!' Leanne?

31:36.430 --> 31:39.590
Honey, you might want to exercise
your right to remain silent.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.310
Bitch went from me, sir... Ma'am.

31:45.710 --> 31:49.230
You know, fucking rednecks, what are
you going to do? Give them a ride?

31:52.629 --> 31:55.709
There is a logical explanation
for everything

31:55.829 --> 31:57.749
that's happened here today.

31:59.309 --> 32:01.749
I see no evidence of a miracle.

32:01.869 --> 32:05.269
The girl has a syndrome.

32:07.709 --> 32:12.149
A medically recognised recondition
where dead people seemingly

32:12.269 --> 32:14.229
come back to life.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.789
There have been 38 cases...

32:20.909 --> 32:22.909
since 1982.

32:23.029 --> 32:25.669
They can't all be Jesus.

32:33.069 --> 32:35.749
The child is not the saviour.

32:48.989 --> 32:50.589
That was cool.

32:53.509 --> 32:57.469
'Chaos in Poland this evening

32:57.589 --> 33:00.229

You've been gone hours.

33:24.349 --> 33:25.789
Where were you?

33:28.989 --> 33:32.869
Saw your sister on the news. Please
tell me you are not helping her.

33:36.189 --> 33:40.789
Oh, jeez, Scotty. You know
how many laws you just broke?

33:40.949 --> 33:43.669
You know they're going to be
watching your family,

33:43.829 --> 33:46.109
seeing if she contacts anyone,
right? Mm hm.

33:46.269 --> 33:49.629
So? Yeah, I just went
to see her husband.

33:49.789 --> 33:53.989
Think his room's being watched.
Shit. OK.

33:54.149 --> 33:57.629
I can still contain this
if it stops right now.

33:57.789 --> 34:01.109
What, so you want me to turn
my back on my own sister?

34:01.229 --> 34:02.869
No, I don't want that,

34:03.029 --> 34:06.309
but you been under surveillance
just isn't going to work.

34:06.469 --> 34:09.549
We need total secrecy. Anyone
hears anything, we're screwed.

34:09.708 --> 34:13.228
She's my sister, she needs me.
I need you.

34:18.668 --> 34:20.748
I don't think I can do this.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.149
What? I'm sorry.

34:24.268 --> 34:26.188
The bunker and the lying...

34:28.349 --> 34:33.188
It's wrong. It's not wrong.
And you can do it.

34:35.389 --> 34:38.309
Scotty, it's not like
we're benefiting.

34:38.469 --> 34:42.188
If the world ends, we're just
as dead as everyone else.

34:42.349 --> 34:45.629
Except we've got the burden
of knowledge, they don't.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.589
You're not the only one
who's terrified.

35:10.069 --> 35:13.189
It's probably your sister. Yeah.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.069
I'm going to take a shower. OK.

35:21.389 --> 35:23.269
Come on, pick up!

35:23.389 --> 35:25.509
'This is Scotty. Leave me a message.'

35:25.629 --> 35:27.269
Dammit!

35:27.429 --> 35:32.989
Oh man! You know what, I love being
a cop. I think I missed my calling.

35:34.389 --> 35:37.709
Any time you want to thank me
for saving you, you can

35:37.829 --> 35:39.989
just chime right on in.

35:40.149 --> 35:42.829
What should I thank you for?
For tasering me?

35:42.949 --> 35:45.069
Or for abandoning me?

35:49.509 --> 35:51.429
Ow!

35:51.589 --> 35:56.309
Let me get something straight.
I do not abandon my friends ever.

35:56.469 --> 35:59.109
When you was in that house
getting fed,

35:59.269 --> 36:02.749
I was on my hand and knees outside
that window watching over you.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.749
And it's a good thing I did, too,

36:04.909 --> 36:08.629
otherwise your ass would be on its
way back to jail right about now.

36:08.789 --> 36:11.269
You were really there
the whole time?

36:11.389 --> 36:13.629
So you know they're looking for me.

36:13.789 --> 36:17.229
Would have been a lot safer for you
to just ditch me.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.069
Well, that ain't me.

36:20.869 --> 36:24.349
Look, I know a normal life,
you cross the road to avoid me.

36:24.509 --> 36:27.709
But this ain't normal, hon. We've
got the whole world gunning for us.

36:27.869 --> 36:30.349
And I need just one person
on my side.

36:30.469 --> 36:32.469
So how about it?

36:38.109 --> 36:40.149
But could I be the cop for a while?

36:42.189 --> 36:43.869
Oh, man.

36:45.549 --> 36:46.989
All right.

36:47.149 --> 36:50.389
But, wait, I thought you said
we can't wear our prison fatigues.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.189
Well, I ain't wearing that dress.

36:52.349 --> 36:54.829
And I know we on the run,
but that is a no.

36:56.549 --> 36:59.149
So you came to find Mary?

36:59.309 --> 37:02.909
You know, I grew up
on the commune with her.

37:03.069 --> 37:05.229
She was like a second mum
to me, I mean,

37:05.389 --> 37:07.749
I can tell you everything
you need to know.

37:07.869 --> 37:09.709
I don't think I want to know.

37:09.829 --> 37:11.909
Just where she is, that'll do.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.909
All right.

37:14.029 --> 37:15.589
I just thought...

37:15.749 --> 37:18.669
When I was like this
she dumped me in a car park.

37:21.269 --> 37:23.069
What kind of person does that...

37:24.749 --> 37:26.549
..to something this helpless?

37:28.309 --> 37:30.189
And why ditch me but keep my brother?

37:31.989 --> 37:34.589
The fact is, she may have been
like a mother to you

37:34.709 --> 37:36.509
but she was nothing like one to me.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.749
When can I call my mum?

37:42.869 --> 37:45.149
I need you to put these on first.

37:45.269 --> 37:48.029
Why? Because I said so.

37:53.789 --> 37:57.909
Word of advice,
never leave your webcam uncovered.

37:58.069 --> 38:01.309
Have you ever heard of a programme
called Face Chaser?

38:01.469 --> 38:05.149
No? It's because the NSA
doesn't want you to.

38:05.269 --> 38:07.229
Facial-recognition software.

38:07.389 --> 38:09.749
You scan a photo
of who you're looking for,

38:09.909 --> 38:13.149
it monitors every security camera,
every webcam on earth.

38:13.309 --> 38:16.989
They go anywhere near a laptop
or an ATM, bam! You've got 'em.

38:18.069 --> 38:19.629
And I want it.

38:19.749 --> 38:22.549
Why? Who are you trying to find?

38:22.669 --> 38:24.149
A friend...

38:24.269 --> 38:25.709
who ran away.

38:27.029 --> 38:29.789
You get me into the NSA,
you get me Face Chaser,

38:29.949 --> 38:32.269
and then we can talk
about your mum, OK?

38:55.309 --> 38:57.149
Let's go.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.109
What happened? Are you OK?

39:04.109 --> 39:07.109
That is the last time that
I ever try to use reason with

39:07.229 --> 39:10.189
an angry mob. It's OK, it's over.

39:10.309 --> 39:11.869
Keep moving, people,

39:12.029 --> 39:15.429
there's nothing to see here.
It's all perfectly rational.

39:15.549 --> 39:17.869
Yes. Perfectly rational.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.989
This was Mary's room.

39:25.669 --> 39:27.589
It's the rapture.

39:27.709 --> 39:29.309
It took your mum 15 years.

39:30.749 --> 39:35.269
The ones on the string are going to
heaven. The others are the dammed.

39:35.389 --> 39:37.829
The Four Horsemen are somewhere.

39:37.949 --> 39:40.469
I think one of them broke, though.

39:40.629 --> 39:43.949
Look, there's the station
and shops.

39:44.069 --> 39:45.749
I know, it's Slough.

39:49.869 --> 39:52.269
There's the car park
she left me in.

39:57.469 --> 39:58.909
A little baby in a box.

40:01.909 --> 40:04.309
Why are you showing me this?

40:04.469 --> 40:07.069
Because it wouldn't be fair
to you not to.

40:07.229 --> 40:12.189
You need to understand before you
meet her, that's where she lives now.

40:12.349 --> 40:15.549
It's a private psychiatric
clinic in Scotland.

40:17.069 --> 40:19.469
She was sectioned a few years ago.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.269
It's in the Highlands.

40:27.389 --> 40:28.909
Be honest with me.

40:30.149 --> 40:31.669
Am I wasting my time?

40:32.989 --> 40:37.469
How gone is she? Will she even know
where Ariel is? I don't know.

40:38.909 --> 40:42.029
But if anyone knows how to find him,
it's Mary.

40:42.189 --> 40:46.109
I mean, someone's paying
the bills to keep her there.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.709
God, this place depresses me.

42:25.989 --> 42:27.469
Who are they?

42:29.469 --> 42:31.909
And what do you want us to do
when we find them?

42:38.229 --> 42:41.869
We are searching for two fugitives
believed to be in these parts.

42:41.989 --> 42:43.949
There's a man outside the window.

42:44.069 --> 42:45.829
Did he see your face?

42:45.949 --> 42:47.749
He saw everything!

42:47.869 --> 42:49.349
A jumper.

42:49.469 --> 42:51.589
Are you dancing? You never dance.

42:53.389 --> 42:56.989
You would risk a man's life for your
moment in front of the cameras?

42:58.989 --> 43:01.549
Gentlemen, I give you Face Chaser.

43:03.389 --> 43:04.429
Leanne, ideas?

43:05.829 --> 43:08.229
I can take it from here, sweet pea.
