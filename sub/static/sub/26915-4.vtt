[crowing]

00:29.529 --> 00:32.115
Let's hope for the talent show tonight

00:32.198 --> 00:34.909
that our audience
is a little more receptive.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.077
[cricket chirping]

00:36.161 --> 00:38.663
You kidding?
When the audience sees our routine,

00:38.747 --> 00:42.792
there won't be a single person
or animal left in their seat.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.004
Hey, guys.
Skye, are you about ready to go?

00:46.087 --> 00:48.006
You bet we are!

00:49.215 --> 00:50.925
Oh, I forgot.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.637
Trish, I'm gonna have to meet you
at the theater tonight.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.475
I promised the Moore family
I'd take care of their horse, Bristol,

00:58.558 --> 01:02.479
-while they're away this weekend.
-Okay. See you on the stage. Bye.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.231
-[Billy] Hi.
-Bye.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.402
We're headed out, too, Mom.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.197
We're gonna head over
and check on Bristol

01:12.280 --> 01:13.865
-on the way to the show.
-Right.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.952
Um, Mom, could I ask you a favor?

01:18.036 --> 01:20.663
Does it involve creatures with long ears?

01:21.331 --> 01:22.165
Yeah.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.376
Trish and I
were cleaning the rabbit pens,

01:25.460 --> 01:28.838
but then we thought the bunnies might like
to see our dance routine,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.800
and then, well, we got distracted.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.260
-Did the bunnies like your dancing?
-They loved it.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.555
-Oh, good. Did they clap a lot?
-Very quietly.

01:38.807 --> 01:42.060
So, are you good to finish up here?
I'll do your chores tomorrow.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.355
You mean I can sleep in?
[laughs] You've got a deal.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.397
Thanks, Mom!

01:46.606 --> 01:48.274
Alright. I'll finish up around here.

01:48.358 --> 01:52.612
Oh, Bianca is stopping by
for a little pre-performance pep talk.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.115
-[crowing]
-Oh! Good luck with that.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.408
Oh, Grandpa, it's break a leg.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.245
Right, break a leg.
And you can break two legs.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.705
-Oh, Grandpa.
-Oh! Oh.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.124

Um, the dressing rooms
are backstage to the right.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.881
Oh, and, Shelby--

03:34.964 --> 03:37.217
Ah, ah, ah. It's Alice.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.552
Alice?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.597
[scoffs] We don't have an Alice
signed up for the show.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.224
Are you mad?

03:44.557 --> 03:48.436
I don't think so. I'm the Stage Manager.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.898
Shelby's deep in character
for her performance.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.067
She'll only replies to the name Alice.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.863
Oh! Alice. Like Alice in Wonderland? Cool.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.952
Okay, well, Alice,
you will be the seventh act tonight.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.496
Thank you. Come on, Alice.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.333
Yes, you better get going.
Don't want to be late.

Oh, dear! I shall not be late!

the note about the outfit.

04:40.196 --> 04:44.659
I specifically said I don't want us
to look like country bumpkins.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.162
No, I just haven't had
a second to change. I just--

04:48.246 --> 04:50.915
I still have lots of chores to finish up
before we go.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.878
Oh! Chores? How charming.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.382
Unfortunately,
a Rescue Ranch doesn't run itself, Bianca.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.175
Terribly unfortunate.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.263
But, seriously, you're going to change
those clothes, right?

05:05.346 --> 05:10.226
The first step to a standout performance
is a knockout look.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.853
Oh, oh.

[Skye] Hmm...

05:28.619 --> 05:31.581
I know I latched the stall door
this morning.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.251

he's a bit of an escape artist.

supposed to be out here.

he's not in the yard.

[Grandpa] True enough.

05:46.804 --> 05:50.767
Now give it to me. There we go. Thank you.

Hey, buddy. Come on in here.

-[whines]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:03.696 --> 06:05.907
Why is he so restless?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.658
He was fine this morning,

06:07.742 --> 06:10.703
but now he's pawing the ground
and turning to look at his side.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.955
He is definitely off.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.960
Oh, Grandpa, look.

06:18.628 --> 06:23.341
It looks like Bristol knocked over
those crates and ate all the apples.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.177
This could be colic.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.513
Too many apples is dangerous for a horse.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.807
They're only supposed
to have a couple treats.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.434
Well, let's check his pulse.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.480
His pulse is elevated.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.233
Oh, look.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.276
[Skye] Oh, no. He's sweating.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.989
This is definitely colic.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.200
-Can you grab my bag?
-[whines]

06:49.283 --> 06:50.743

Good boy. Good boy.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.505
-Here.
-Thanks.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.009
We should give him something
for the pain, right?

07:07.385 --> 07:11.597
Oh, and that, uh, oil
to relieve his tummy, I think.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.475
Well, that's right. And then we wait.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.691
Ethan! All ready for tonight?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.650
I don't know.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.820
That move that you showed me
is pretty hard.

07:25.903 --> 07:29.532
If it were easy,
everybody would be doing it.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.743
Whoa.

I still don't know, Alistair.
I still don't know.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.293
Oh, no! Skye and I have been practicing
this routine for weeks.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.544
What'll I do without her?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.298
I hope Bristol's gonna be alright.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.182
[sighs] How long is this going to take?

07:54.265 --> 07:57.310
I secured us a prime performance slot.

07:57.393 --> 08:01.689
I can't allow us to be late simply
'cause you're fussing with some animal.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.858
It's called farming, Bianca.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.152
We take pride in taking care
of our animals.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.822
That's why you brought Shelby and Apollo
here in the first place, remember?

08:10.114 --> 08:11.574
-Yes.
-[goat bleating]

08:11.657 --> 08:14.327
But it's mighty inconvenient for it now.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.788
If you wanna help,
this could go a lot faster.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
And risk losing a finger? [scoffs]

08:21.000 --> 08:23.836
Utterly impossible. [laughs]

08:29.842 --> 08:31.552
-Olivia.
-Uh, just a second.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.888
The fiddlers are fighting
on who's gonna be first,

08:33.971 --> 08:35.806
and Barry needs some...

08:36.474 --> 08:37.642
tea.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.811
How very impolite of him.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.731

and he pretended not to hear me!

Alice. [chuckles]

08:47.151 --> 08:50.363
I know it's a little crazy in here,
but we all have to get along.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.991
How dare you interrupt me mid monologue!

08:54.575 --> 08:56.786
She's talking to the White Rabbit.

Ah!

-Of course.
-Olivia...

09:02.833 --> 09:05.002
Just please try to keep it down a little?

09:05.086 --> 09:08.381
Olivia! Skye is not coming.
We can't do our routine.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.008
What? But I scheduled you
for the big closing act!

09:12.802 --> 09:15.179
I can't focus in these conditions!

Not cool! That rabbit is an integral part
of my performance.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.154
Where did he go?

09:32.238 --> 09:35.908
Well, to tell you the truth,
that trick's never worked before.

09:37.577 --> 09:42.373
Alright. Everyone, just stay calm.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.916

Ten minutes to show time. [sighs]

Mike, we have a crisis.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.892
Thank you, Mr. Moore.
I'll call you later with an update.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.354
Finally! Some good news.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.189
Yes! A relief.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.359
Mr. Moore said that the crates
were almost finished.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.654
-They were less than a quarter full.
-Thank goodness.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.032
It's a matter of time
before Bristol's better.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.869
So, we don't have as big as a problem
as we thought did.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.496
I think we're gonna see him
improve right away.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.254
Have you seen the White Rabbit?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.133
Yes? No?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.094
Have you seen the White Rabbit?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.434
Hot water with honey and lemon
to soothe your throat.

10:44.852 --> 10:49.815
If it works, you should be able
to introduce the acts with actual words.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.609
Miming can be our backup plan.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.320
You're welcome.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.581
[quacking]

11:07.083 --> 11:10.503
If you helped me we could
squeeze in practice before we're on stage.

11:11.170 --> 11:15.591
Practice? What are we, amateurs? [laughs]

11:15.883 --> 11:19.678
Isn't one of those Horseysitter kids
around to make things go faster?

11:20.429 --> 11:24.016
-They're already at the theater.
-As we should be.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.896
-[sighs] Exactly what I was thinking.
-Oh, no! Take it back! Ugh!

11:28.979 --> 11:31.190
You'll have to help me.
We have to work together

11:31.273 --> 11:33.317
if we want to see that stage at all.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.652
[snarling]

11:34.735 --> 11:36.654
I think I can see a fang!

11:41.200 --> 11:42.910
What are you doing out here?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.246
The show's gonna start soon.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.165
Where am I supposed to be?
My partner's not coming.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.961
I know it's not her fault. But the routine
we planned was amazing.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.714
You can still do an amazing routine.
You've got the best performance slot.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.009
I can't dance
a two-person dance routine on my own.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.886
[scoffs] Trish.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.807
I've got an MC with no voice,
a missing White Rabbit,

12:04.890 --> 12:06.308
[scoffs] no show jugglers,

12:06.392 --> 12:09.854
two fiddlers that won't stop fighting,
but it's going to be great.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.190
Sometimes you have to go with the flow

12:13.274 --> 12:15.484
and dance your way
through tough situations.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.319
How am I supposed to do that?

12:17.653 --> 12:20.781
Use your talent.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.617
Go up on that stage
and dance your heart out.

12:24.034 --> 12:27.329
No one will have any idea that
it's not the routine that you planned.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.708
The audience just wants to see you
doing what you love to do.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.837
-Go with the flow.
-You can do this.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.510
I don't have the right music downloaded.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.263
Skye was gonna bring our music
on her phone.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.474
This should cheer you up.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.559
[laughter]

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
We can definitely find some music
around here.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.815
We can do this!

12:56.775 --> 12:58.194
Okay. Come on.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.821
[laughs]

13:01.697 --> 13:03.824
[crowd applauding]

13:03.908 --> 13:09.705
Hi. I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of my fellow Ponysitters.

where are you going?"
