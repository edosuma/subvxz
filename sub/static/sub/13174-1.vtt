Listen, I know that you guys are...
are scared.

18:22.397 --> 18:24.795
I'm scared, too.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.088
Okay?

18:26.113 --> 18:30.149
We lost probably the most
capable person on the island.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.681
And certainly the most attractive.

18:32.971 --> 18:36.942
But something amazing also happened.

18:36.967 --> 18:40.340
Guys, we survived a plane crash.

18:40.365 --> 18:46.017
I mean, do you understand how
incredibly lucky that we are?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.471
It's like we're hurdling
through the sky in a metal tube

18:48.496 --> 18:50.161
at 1,000 miles an hour,

18:50.186 --> 18:51.203
and then we just, like, hit the ground.

18:51.228 --> 18:53.030
We should all be very dead right now.

18:53.055 --> 18:56.358
And we're not.

18:56.843 --> 18:59.383
I think that if we can
survive that plane crash,

18:59.408 --> 19:01.027
we can survive this island.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.154
How?

19:02.179 --> 19:05.370
That's a great question,
Diane from Topeka.

19:05.421 --> 19:06.623
Toledo.

19:06.648 --> 19:08.048
Yeah.

19:08.176 --> 19:10.702
Pack, you said earlier that
there's got to be something

19:10.727 --> 19:12.585
on this island that
sends a signal, right?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.804
I mean, it's the 21st century.
There's got to be.

19:14.829 --> 19:15.220
Great!

19:15.245 --> 19:17.829
Karen, you killed a boar last night,

19:17.894 --> 19:21.658
I think maybe with your bare hands,
which is insane.

19:21.683 --> 19:23.296
But as long as we have
somebody like Karen,

19:23.321 --> 19:25.275
we're gonna have food, yeah?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.217
Emma, you're a doctor.

19:27.243 --> 19:30.981
If we pool our talents together,
there's absolutely no way...

19:31.006 --> 19:33.483
Hey! Check it out!

19:33.991 --> 19:36.339
Daddy found the drink cart.

19:36.364 --> 19:37.287
Yeah, but, guys...

19:37.312 --> 19:38.755
You guys want to get shit-housed?

19:38.780 --> 19:39.711
Yes, please.

19:39.735 --> 19:41.534

Well, we should probably get Steve down.
