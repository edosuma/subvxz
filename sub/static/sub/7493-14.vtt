WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.500
Thanks for helping me study
for my entrance exam.

00:06.875 --> 00:09.709
If I don't make it into Oxbridge
University, I could end up like...

00:17.375 --> 00:19.125
I'd better make it into Oxbridge.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.583
Hey, my cousin Chuy is DJ'ing
a frat party at Oxbridge.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.667
- We should all go.
- Oh, yeah.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.625
It would totally give you
a chance to relax, Milton.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.959
Relaxation does increase brain function.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.625
Yeah, I think that's true.

00:30.875 --> 00:33.291
My brain relaxes so hard it
takes naps on me all the...

00:37.166 --> 00:38.041
time.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.625
Hey, Joan, looking good
in your new security uniform.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.625
Oh, I love this new job.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.500
And check out my fancy utility belt.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.834
Is that where you keep your
hand cuffs and walkie-talkie?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.959
Oh, no. My chicken niblets,

00:52.375 --> 00:53.875
and my dipping sauce.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.709
Mmm.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.125
I got my sun tea brewing
on the back porch.

01:00.834 --> 01:02.792
Hey, you guys hear the wharf is displaying

01:02.875 --> 01:05.792
Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber
from the movies?

01:07.041 --> 01:08.166
I'm in charge of guarding it.

01:08.250 --> 01:11.625
I love those movies, but is anyone gonna
get that excited about a lightsaber?

01:11.709 --> 01:13.125
I mean, it's just a movie prop.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.000
I am Rudy-Wan Kenobi.

01:20.834 --> 01:21.834
Remember...

01:22.375 --> 01:25.083
Nothing is impossible
when you use the force, Jack.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.667
Except maybe walking
down stairs in a robe.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.458
Guys, this is
the Skull and Bones frat house,

02:21.667 --> 02:23.625
one of America's
most prestigious fraternities.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.667
Do you realize that one of the future
presidents of the United States

02:26.750 --> 02:28.417
is probably in this room right now?

02:29.166 --> 02:30.583
I ate too much cake!

02:30.667 --> 02:32.458
I'm gonna hurl!

02:32.542 --> 02:33.583
Yeah!

02:35.208 --> 02:36.500
If it's him, he's got my vote.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.709
Dude, my cousin Chuy said that they have
an antique Cannon in the backyard

02:39.792 --> 02:41.291
that they blast chocolate pudding out of.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.250
- Let's go check it out! Come on.
- How sick is that?

02:43.333 --> 02:44.917
Oh, no, guys, don't leave me!

02:45.583 --> 02:46.458
Gah!

02:49.500 --> 02:50.375
Wow.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.375
Look at all these trophies.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.625
These guys are impressive.

02:57.417 --> 02:58.417
Whoa!
-

03:00.000 --> 03:02.166
( grunting(

03:02.291 --> 03:03.667
You doing okay there, buddy?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.083
Yeah, just...

03:05.166 --> 03:06.166
- whoa!
-

03:09.458 --> 03:10.959
You might want to take that off.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.125
That's JP's hurling cup.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.458
Oh! Get it off me, get it off me!

03:21.625 --> 03:22.750
Tom Buchanan.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.250
President of the Skull and Bones.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.125
And you're Milton Krupnick.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.166
I've heard of you.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.000
You have?

03:30.083 --> 03:33.500
Junior astronaut, assistant to famed
inventor Derek Tanner,

03:33.583 --> 03:35.000
accepted into Biltmore Academy.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.375
Oh. You're leaving out
that I learned to whistle in the womb.

03:39.959 --> 03:43.041
You know, we're always looking
for Skull and Bones prospects.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.041
That could be you.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.291
My dad's the Dean of admissions
here at Oxbridge.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.250
Your dad is Arthur Winslow Buchanan,

03:51.333 --> 03:53.500
yachting expert and
bird-watching enthusiast?

03:55.875 --> 03:57.458
Some boys like sports...

03:57.834 --> 03:59.083
I like deans.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.667
Relax, have a good time.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.792
I take care of my friends.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.792
Jack! Jerry!

04:08.375 --> 04:09.542
I'm ready to party!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.625
<i>Pudding Cannon!</i>

04:21.375 --> 04:23.875
Hey, so what are you doing for
Kim's birthday now that she's in Japan?

04:24.083 --> 04:25.750
Well, the Otai Academy is really strict.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.375
They only allow one phone call a month

04:27.458 --> 04:29.125
to keep their students
focused on their studies.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.125
Kim's saved her call
and we're gonna FaceTalk tonight.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.542
Oh, cool.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.250
Yeah, I thought about
sending something to Kim.

04:34.834 --> 04:35.917
But you didn't?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.291
Why would I? It's the thought that counts.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.041
Dude, check it out.

04:43.792 --> 04:44.667
Whoa!

04:45.083 --> 04:48.208
Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa!

04:49.125 --> 04:52.208
Whoa! Whoa! Oooh! Whoa!

04:53.291 --> 04:54.750
Sorry, you lose!

04:55.959 --> 04:59.542
Who else thinks they can finish
the "extreme road trip challenge"?

04:59.875 --> 05:02.542
Just survive the trip from California
to New York,

05:02.792 --> 05:05.125
and you win this Yamasuki dirt bike!

05:05.458 --> 05:08.000
But if you fall off the bike, you lose.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.291
Oh!

05:09.625 --> 05:11.166
I'm up for the challenge, my friend.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.208
Let me show you how a real
man rides a hog.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.667
-
- Aah!

05:18.291 --> 05:20.625
Sorry, you lose.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.750
Why'd that hog have to be so loud?

05:28.917 --> 05:32.041
All right, it's a lightsaber.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.458
Take a quick look and move on, people.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.667
Or the empire won't be the only thing...

05:39.250 --> 05:40.417
striking back!

05:41.959 --> 05:43.667
That nerd got it.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.834
Hey! Would it be all
right if I took a picture?

05:47.667 --> 05:51.166
Well, it's against policy,
but I guess one photo wouldn't hurt.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.792
I call this one, uh...

05:54.875 --> 05:56.458
"Shady Lady".

05:59.917 --> 06:00.917
You're welcome.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.875
Tom, I have horrible news.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.000
I stayed so late at your party,
I fell asleep during my college exam,

06:08.291 --> 06:09.834
before I even finished writing my name.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.375
Milton, relax.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.583
Your exams don't matter.
My dad's gonna get you in.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.500
-
- Soon, you'll be one of us.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.166
Oh, I don't know how I'll ever thank you.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.667
I wish you could help me get
a picture holding that lightsaber.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.542
I'm never gonna get one
with that crazy security guard here.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.458
Well, it is almost time
for her dinner break in her office.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.083
That's perfect.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.250
You go in there and turn off
the security system,

06:33.417 --> 06:35.166
I get a cool picture,
and then I put it right back.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.125
Come on.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.083
Help a future brother.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.875
Well, I guess I can distract her
for a minute. It'll be tough, though.

06:43.959 --> 06:47.208
Since she was made chief of security,
she takes her job very seriously.

06:47.291 --> 06:50.041
I call this pose "The Naughty Kitten."

06:52.750 --> 06:53.792
Bad kitty!

06:55.041 --> 06:56.000
I'll see what I can do.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.166
Oh! Granny down!

07:08.500 --> 07:10.083
- Thanks for trying, Nana.
- Whoo!

07:13.458 --> 07:14.291
Jack.

07:14.709 --> 07:16.250
Jack, you gotta win this bike for me, man.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.959
Oh, help me, Jack. You're my only hope.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.083
I'd like to help you, Jerry, but I can't
miss my birthday FaceTalk with Kim,

07:23.166 --> 07:25.041
or I won't be able to talk to her
for another month.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.834
Well, you at least gotta try.

07:27.750 --> 07:28.625
Give me your phone.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.125
If she calls you, I'll let you know
and you can just hop off the bike.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.250
- Fine.
- Oh! You're the man!

07:39.458 --> 07:42.125
Awesome! You start at the desert!

07:42.667 --> 07:44.500
-
- This isn't so bad.

07:44.917 --> 07:47.542
Uh-oh, looks like trouble.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.041
There's some kind of storm brewing.
But what kind is it?

08:00.583 --> 08:02.834
I'm gonna go with sandstorm! Yeah!

08:12.625 --> 08:13.667
You got this, Jack!

08:14.083 --> 08:14.959
Whoo!

08:15.041 --> 08:17.917
Road's about to get bumpy!
Hang on there, Jack!

08:25.709 --> 08:26.750
Hey, Joan.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.291
To celebrate your new job,

08:28.417 --> 08:31.291
I got you a little something
from the stud muffin bakery.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.417
Oh!

08:33.125 --> 08:36.750
Whoo-wee! That's a good-looking muffin!

08:37.458 --> 08:39.250
Oh, and he brought snacks.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.417
-
- Well,

08:42.542 --> 08:46.500
let's give your pumpkin muffin
a little nibble, shall we... Carl?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.041
Cute guys, terrible muffins.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.250
Oh!

08:55.333 --> 08:57.250
Oh, dear! Oh, okay, well!

08:57.333 --> 09:02.542
Look who's dropping by for another
surprise inspection, the mall manager.

09:05.709 --> 09:09.375
Well, don't you worry, I have had
the lightsaber under video surveillance

09:09.458 --> 09:13.375
the whole time, and never
have I taken these eyes off...

09:13.667 --> 09:15.083
Holy Hannah!

09:15.709 --> 09:16.917
It's gone!

09:31.625 --> 09:32.500
You!

09:32.583 --> 09:34.291
You stole the lightsaber!

09:34.375 --> 09:35.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:36.083 --> 09:38.417
Nobody addresses our president
without first greeting him

09:38.500 --> 09:39.709
with the secret handshake.

09:44.291 --> 09:45.166
You!

09:45.250 --> 09:47.792
You stole the lightsaber! You used me!

09:47.959 --> 09:50.291
No, you helped me.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.917
That's what brothers do.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.959
Every president of the Skull and Bones
has to steal a valuable trophy

09:55.041 --> 09:56.291
for the legacy room in this house.

09:56.875 --> 09:57.792
The legacy room?

09:57.875 --> 10:00.625
It's a hidden chamber that contains
awesome, one-of-a-kind collectibles.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.834
It's also a cool place to go if
you need to do something in private.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.291
You know, like cry, rip one, crochet--

10:06.375 --> 10:07.250
JP!

10:09.375 --> 10:11.875
The only trophy we don't keep in there
is our Muhammad Ali alarm clock.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.709
Muhammad Ali's alarm clock?

10:19.083 --> 10:21.417
So, you stole the lightsaber
to put in the legacy room?

10:21.750 --> 10:22.667
I did.

10:22.750 --> 10:27.500
But that was before I found a buyer
that'll give me $20,000 dollars for it.

10:27.583 --> 10:31.041
And with the money, I'm flying
us all to Cancun on spring break.

10:31.125 --> 10:34.125
Spring break! Ooh!

10:35.709 --> 10:38.166
I'm not going to Cancun.
I'm going to the police.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.000
You got my friend Joan in trouble.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.667
Okay, Milton. You go to the police,

10:42.750 --> 10:46.583
and you tell them that you're the one
who turned off the security system.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.375
Or...

10:54.583 --> 10:58.166
This Skull and Bones ring
is a symbol of brotherhood.

10:58.667 --> 11:02.083
You put this ring on, and my
dad will get you into Oxbridge

11:02.166 --> 11:03.667
and your future will be set.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.458
- What do you say?
- I do.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.083
Just one more mile and we win the bike.

11:22.166 --> 11:24.792
I thought you told me this
contest was impossible to win!

11:25.125 --> 11:28.083
I'm not giving away that bike!
Let's hit him with the tornado!

11:29.834 --> 11:30.792
Whoa!

11:34.166 --> 11:36.542
- I can't hold on!
- No, you got this, Jack!

11:41.041 --> 11:42.834
Use the force, Jack.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.417
- But it's impossible!
- I said use it!

12:00.375 --> 12:02.041
- Yes!
- Oh!

12:12.625 --> 12:14.750
- We won!
- Yes!

12:15.834 --> 12:18.375
Looks like we have a winner.
I couldn't be happier.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.959
-
- Thank you.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.583
Dude, dude, we won! Bro!

12:24.959 --> 12:26.917
Dude, that was incredible.
How did you do that?

12:27.959 --> 12:29.417
You're not going to believe this, but...

12:29.792 --> 12:30.875
I think it was...

12:31.333 --> 12:32.458
The force.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.500
All right, people, new rule, okay?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.750
From now on, no one can use The Force.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.917
Are you kidding me?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.417
Kim called 15 times
and you didn't tell me?

12:49.583 --> 12:50.667
You seemed busy.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.959
"Guess you can't talk.
Maybe next month. Going to bed."

12:55.208 --> 12:57.250
Jerry, you knew how important
this call was to me.

12:58.542 --> 12:59.625
I thought you were my friend.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.208
Whoa, whoa, Jack, wait!

13:02.709 --> 13:04.834
Look, I can't let you walk away like this.

13:07.291 --> 13:08.709
You have the keys to my bike.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.417
Milton, you gotta help me, man.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.625
Joan was fired.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.041
What?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.291
Joan was fired?

13:26.375 --> 13:29.208
Yeah, and she can't pay her rent,
so she moved in here with her cat.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.291
- That's a loud cat.
- That was Joan.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.959
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.125
My boss took away my badge.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.458
She took away my taser!

14:00.375 --> 14:02.834
But you know what I hated losing the most?

14:03.834 --> 14:05.000
Your dignity?

14:06.166 --> 14:08.166
My utility belt.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.125
Without it I'm just some sad woman

14:13.208 --> 14:17.041
walking around with ranch
dressing in her pants.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.333
Since I made you miss your birthday
FaceTalk with Kim,

14:27.750 --> 14:29.417
I got her sensei to make
an exception and I...

14:30.166 --> 14:31.250
set up another one.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.417
Really?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.000
Kim?

14:37.083 --> 14:38.125
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

14:38.208 --> 14:40.041
Kim, I can hear you, but I can't see you.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.667
What is up with your computer?

14:43.625 --> 14:44.500
Is that better?

14:45.625 --> 14:47.250
Kim! Kim, what...

14:47.750 --> 14:49.792
- You're here!
-

14:50.041 --> 14:51.125
How are you here?

14:51.500 --> 14:54.667
Jerry sold his motorcycle and bought me
a round-trip ticket from Japan.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.583
You're my friend, Jack.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.625
And what I did was wrong.

15:02.583 --> 15:03.792
Well, you made up for it, Jerry.

15:10.792 --> 15:14.041
Well, guys, I just met with Tom's dad.
And it's official.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.834
After I graduate high school,
I'll be accepted to Oxbridge.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.166
Yeah!

15:21.166 --> 15:22.041
Hello?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.083
Oh, you're pulling up now?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.375
You're early.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.000
Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. That's fine.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.834
That's the buyer.
He's here for the lightsaber.

15:29.917 --> 15:33.458
This guy is the biggest "Star Wars"
memorabilia collector in the world,

15:33.542 --> 15:35.041
and nobody knows his identity.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.917
How does he keep his identity a secret?

15:42.083 --> 15:44.000
Let's make this fast.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.500
Yes, sir, I know you're a busy man.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.291
No, I had
a large Mexican breakfast

15:48.375 --> 15:50.291
and it's a living nightmare in here.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.291
Hair, freeze-bags!

16:02.375 --> 16:03.959
I mean, freeze, hair-bags!

16:05.125 --> 16:06.041
It's a trap!

16:06.125 --> 16:07.709
To the death star! I mean,

16:07.792 --> 16:08.792
my mini-van.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.125
Hey, you're not going anywhere, wheezy.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.208
Joan, what are you doing here?

16:13.667 --> 16:15.792
Oh, you think you're so smart.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.709
You shut off my security cameras,
but you forgot about Phil's.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.125
Gah!

16:22.208 --> 16:23.417
Guys, I'm sorry.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.792
And when the cops see the footage
on this flash drive,

16:26.875 --> 16:28.834
you all are going to jail!

16:29.333 --> 16:30.500
No, no, we can't go to jail!

16:30.583 --> 16:32.625
Our tickets to Cancun are non-refundable!

16:35.041 --> 16:36.291
Tom, I have an idea.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.542
She doesn't make much money.
I think I got a way out of this.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.125
- Just do whatever it takes, man.
- Okay.

16:40.875 --> 16:41.834
Uh, Joan.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.834
How about $20,000
and we forget this whole thing?

16:45.583 --> 16:48.291
Are you trying to bribe me for $20,000?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.959
I have dedicated my life
to upholding the law.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.291
What about 25,000?

16:54.417 --> 16:55.250
I'm in.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.834
Tom, we don't have another $5,000.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.166
Yes, we do.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.417
Pick something out.

17:10.792 --> 17:13.709
This room is full of things the Skull
and Bones have stolen over the years.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.500
Did you hear all that, president McIntyre?

17:17.917 --> 17:20.333
I certainly did. Nice work, Milton.

17:20.834 --> 17:21.750
What's going on?

17:21.834 --> 17:24.375
What's going on is you just got hustled.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.041
That's not the buyer.
That's my sensei, Rudy.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.417
Oh, I'm like a Dutch oven with a cape.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.166
And this flash drive?

17:36.083 --> 17:37.208
Nothing on it.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.875
As president of the university,
I'm banning the Skull and Bones fraternity

17:40.959 --> 17:42.542
from the Oxbridge campus forever,

17:43.208 --> 17:45.667
and returning all of this stuff
to their rightful owners.

17:45.875 --> 17:49.041
Hmm, looks like
you boys are going to jail.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.583
Oh, please tell me that jail is in Cancun.

18:02.083 --> 18:02.959
Rudy,

18:03.041 --> 18:05.083
you've had that lightsaber
for ten minutes.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.375
Let someone else hold it!

18:07.750 --> 18:10.875
A powerful Jedi like me can never
be separated from his lightsaber...

18:10.959 --> 18:11.834
Aah! Ow, ow!

18:11.917 --> 18:12.834
Take it, take it!

18:16.000 --> 18:17.583
Sorry, I'm late,

18:17.667 --> 18:20.959
I had to escape imperial forces
that had me trapped in quadrant seven.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.917
Is that code for some bullies locked
you in the dumpster behind the alley?

18:25.375 --> 18:26.834
Affirmative, master Jerry.

18:28.667 --> 18:29.542
I gotta get going.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.041
It was good seeing you guys.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.542
- You too.
- We'll miss you.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.583
Next time bring gifts.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.667
Can't you stay one more day?

18:41.625 --> 18:43.709
I'm sorry, Jack. You know how it is.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.166
Hey.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.125
Even though we're like 6,000 miles away,

18:50.417 --> 18:51.709
I never stop thinking about you.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.625
I feel the same way.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.583
Yo, Rudy, can you teach
me to use the force?

19:04.291 --> 19:05.166
So, I can win more stuff?

19:06.375 --> 19:08.041
The force isn't for winning stuff.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.333
It's a...

19:09.625 --> 19:13.583
a spiritual power you feel deep inside you
when you've got something to fight for.

19:18.542 --> 19:20.291
<i>I'm sorry, I couldn't stop them.</i>

19:20.792 --> 19:22.250
<i>Just hang on, I'm coming for you.</i>

19:22.333 --> 19:24.083
<i>They're too strong.
No.</i>

19:24.166 --> 19:25.375
<i>Not if we're together.</i>

19:25.834 --> 19:27.792
<i>But we're not. It's too late.</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:31.166
<i>- Forget about me, Jack.
-</i>

19:31.291 --> 19:32.166
No!

19:57.542 --> 19:58.750
Drop your weapon!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.333
Aah! Uh!
-

20:16.166 --> 20:17.917
Give it up!
You'll never save her!

20:44.125 --> 20:45.542
Where is she?

20:46.208 --> 20:49.959
Join us, and I will take you to her.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.625
Never.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.542
Then suffer the consequences.

21:01.792 --> 21:02.875
Aah!

21:24.875 --> 21:26.083
This is pointless.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.542
She's already one of us.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.208
Liar!

22:08.375 --> 22:09.625
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

22:16.000 --> 22:17.208
Jack! Jack,

22:17.291 --> 22:18.583
my flight just got cancelled!

22:18.667 --> 22:19.792
I don't leave until tomorrow!

22:26.792 --> 22:27.875
Oh, my!

22:29.250 --> 22:30.125
Whoa!

22:57.291 --> 22:58.166
<i>Poor soul.</i>

23:02.000 --> 23:02.875
<i>Yes!</i>
