WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.630
Alright, we got, Zombies
that sing the blues

00:08.843 --> 00:12.051
or Sexy Vampire Doctor
goes back to college

00:12.263 --> 00:13.799
because he lost his way?

00:14.015 --> 00:14.879
Is that it?

00:15.099 --> 00:16.509
I also have Jerry Maguire.

00:16.726 --> 00:20.093
No, I mean with Bo and
The Wanderer. Is that just it?

00:20.313 --> 00:23.555
I dunno, she locked
me out, okay?

00:23.774 --> 00:25.389
Four years I've
been her best friend.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.941
I know everything about her.

00:27.153 --> 00:29.235
Every heart
break, every tear.

00:29.447 --> 00:30.857
And just like that, I'm out.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.155
Okay so if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to forget about it all

00:33.367 --> 00:35.949
and just watch some
Zombie movies, okay?

00:36.162 --> 00:37.948
I like Zombies.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.871
Taking a break from
athletic shower sex,

00:41.083 --> 00:42.619
post-slaughtering
the Una Mens?

00:42.835 --> 00:44.666
l have been meaning
to talk to you.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.460
Oh yeah, how about
Dyson and Lauren?

00:46.672 --> 00:49.288
One day... What do
you want me to say?

00:49.508 --> 00:51.294
I want you to say,
you're not brainwashed.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.046
I want you to say that
I still have a best friend.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.127
Of course you still
have a best friend.

00:55.348 --> 00:56.633
And no, I am not brainwashed.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.714
And as far as Dyson and
Lauren go, it's not like it was

00:58.935 --> 01:01.972
ever perfect.
Dyson gave his love away

01:02.188 --> 01:04.270
and then he became an
a-hole for like forever.

01:04.482 --> 01:05.517
We called him Mopey Dick.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.519
And then I broke
his heart with Lauren,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.771
and now she's all buddy
buddy with the Morrigan.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.193
All bad things.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.906
But with Rainer.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.367
I finally feel like I
have provided something

01:15.576 --> 01:16.861
to a relationship.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.363
I broke his curse.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.614
We want the same things.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.570
lt's bigger than love.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.248
And I am sorry if I
locked you out, Kenzi.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.041
| just needed some time.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.713
You complete me.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.630
Hale asked Kenzi
to move in with him.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.596
What?

01:36.806 --> 01:37.795
We don't know
that yet. Okay.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.880
He just needs to talk.
Says it's important.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.807
Also known as terrifying.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.805
You're leaving me?

01:44.021 --> 01:46.103
Sucks when it
happens to you, huh?

01:47.984 --> 01:49.520
Oh, come here you.

01:51.112 --> 01:55.025
You had me at a-hole.
You had me at a-hole.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.320
Now, go downstairs.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.286
Snacks need drinks.

01:59.495 --> 02:00.610
Have I taught you nothing?

02:00.830 --> 02:02.946
So much.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.120
I'll be right back.

02:09.213 --> 02:16.801
(deep gargling breathing)

02:17.013 --> 02:18.298
Agh!

02:21.559 --> 02:23.390
This is usually
the part where you die.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.057
(slice)

02:24.270 --> 02:27.262
(struggling for air)

02:27.481 --> 02:29.437
(slice)

02:29.650 --> 02:31.436
(breathing stops)

02:32.403 --> 02:35.736
(thunk, splat, thunk)

02:37.825 --> 02:40.942
And you must be, Bo?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.455
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.704
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.707
My love carries
a death sentence.

02:52.923 --> 02:57.713
I was lost for years.
Searching while hiding.

02:57.928 --> 03:01.967
Only to find that l belonged
to a world hidden from humans.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.673
I won 't hide anymore.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.259
I will live the life I choose.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.266
You're supposed to be dead!

03:14.487 --> 03:19.698
What can I say?
I'm just a lucky girl.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.325
New?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.448
Massimo grew
it on to my stump.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.790
How'd you lose the hand?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.115
The Wanderer had
his crows cut it off

03:29.335 --> 03:32.077
because my protégé
here didn't deliver you

03:32.296 --> 03:34.127
as quickly as he wanted.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.456
Hugin and Munin
betrayed Rainer.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.176
They could have
been acting alone.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.672
So you two are on a
first name basis now?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.628
He's her boyfriend.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.429
And I'm out.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.631
Okay, Acacia, wait.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.388
This wasn't a
social call Tamsin.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.596
I'm a revenant hunter now, it's
just a lucky coincidence that

03:51.816 --> 03:53.602
someone was trying to
kill your friend here.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.274
Revenant?

03:55.486 --> 03:59.946
Dead Fae risen from the
dead to settle old scores.

04:00.157 --> 04:04.947
Very effective. Acacia and |
used to use them all the time.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.285
We need to talk
to your boytoy. Now.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.795
He left late last night.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.544
He went to the battlefields.
To pay respect to the dead.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.920
Yeah or to re-animate them.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.252
No. No way.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.713
What do you really
know about Crazy Train?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.514
I know that
I broke his curse.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.512
And I know that
he's a good guy.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.854
How?

04:31.063 --> 04:33.395
You don't think that I would
know if he wanted to kill me?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.357
| just know.

04:34.567 --> 04:35.397
Let's see.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.772
"R" right? Nothing.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.855
These books have every
moment of our history in them

04:42.074 --> 04:44.065
and he's no where
to be found. Why?

04:44.285 --> 04:46.116
Where's Rainer?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.289
Alright. Get your coats.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.286
Where are we going?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.333
You two are the experts.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.128
Let's find out who's
really raising the dead.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.672
Prove that Rainer
isn't behind this.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.136
Guys, unbelieveable.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.634
Seriously, would I leave
a dead body on the floor

05:08.851 --> 05:10.557
if her boyfriend
was coming over?

05:17.318 --> 05:17.977
Thanks for coming.

05:18.194 --> 05:19.855
Yeah well aren't
you supposed to

05:20.070 --> 05:22.197
be out restoring
the faith? Huh?

05:22.406 --> 05:23.942
Spreading the good word?

05:24.158 --> 05:26.900
Ding dong, the
Una Mens are dead?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.780
Still drafting my condolences.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.827
That's not the tune
I was expecting from

05:31.040 --> 05:33.326
the acting leader of the Light.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.624
| used to be a King.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.622
Didn't do that very
well either I'm afraid.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.295
Ha-ha. Come on, every
kid from here to Hibernia

05:40.508 --> 05:43.671
knows the tales of your
long and glorious reign.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.422
History is written
by the victors.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.674
History is written in blood.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.757
"And so he rode
upon his noble steed

05:50.976 --> 05:54.969
and cut down the vile insurgent,
thus ending the rebellion,

05:55.189 --> 05:59.228
and bringing
peace to the land."

05:59.443 --> 06:03.777
No matter what I did,
Rainer always had an answer,

06:03.989 --> 06:05.775
always ten steps ahead.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.856
His gift is Foresight.

06:08.077 --> 06:11.194
I had no choice
but to use my blood.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.620
I wrote that his
armies betrayed him.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.538
He was evil wasn't he?

06:15.751 --> 06:19.539
Just defiant.
Like my granddaughter.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.416
Yeah well I can't
argue with that.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.714
There's real
evil in the world Vex.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.214
Real terrors.
The Garuda was evil.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.257
The Pyrippus.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.433
That's real evil.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.474
The Pyrippus?

06:38.691 --> 06:41.103
Come on. Bat winged
horse? Honestly.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.570
You got a better chance
of meeting Godzilla.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.441
I should have
been a better king.

06:46.657 --> 06:51.777
Yeah well, who amongst us
doesn't have any regrets, eh?

06:52.580 --> 06:55.617
Yeah, there be a fewer empty
seats 'round the old holiday

06:55.833 --> 07:00.953
roast if I hadn't betrayed my
own family to save my own hide.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.083
Your father, Clust,
was one of the bravest men

07:04.300 --> 07:05.255
I've ever known.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.048
Oh, come on. He was
a bloody fisherman.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.876
Why the hell
would you know him?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.836
He was my best general.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.466
He was a hero.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.594
No, my father believed that

07:14.810 --> 07:17.267
kids should be
seen and not heard.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.470
He never liked my jokes.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.773
He never liked me at all.

07:22.985 --> 07:27.399
I never knew my father.
And that suited him just fine.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.407
What do you want to know?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.833
(knocking)

07:42.630 --> 07:44.541
Hey, hopefully not-a-dead-dude

07:44.757 --> 07:48.716
but my abs-olicious
sex machine.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.007
Oh my god, Dimitri.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.676
Hey.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.800
Hi, wh-what
are you doing here?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.131
We come to see you!

07:55.351 --> 07:58.514
Uh, 69 Camaro. Yellow. Yours?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.685
Uh no, my roommate's.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.229
Uh, call it off.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.103
What do you mean we?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.559
Solnushka.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.603
Mom.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.572
BO: What is this place?

08:16.789 --> 08:19.121
TAMSIN: Where people go when
they don't want to be found.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.790
Or to find someone to
carry out their dirty work.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.458
If they're out of town.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.535
Rainer didn't do this.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.460
Uh huh!

08:25.673 --> 08:28.961
Tell me, what's the weather
like in Rainer-land?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.541
Dark and stormy?

08:30.761 --> 08:31.967
Sunny and shady?

08:32.179 --> 08:32.964
lam warning you--

08:33.180 --> 08:34.169
Would you two focus?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.631
This is where the Cults
of the Dead hang out.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.933
|f Rainer hired revenants,
or if he didn't,

08:40.145 --> 08:42.010
these would be the
guys he'd go through.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.061
We'll know soon enough.

08:43.273 --> 08:47.687
(screaming)

08:47.903 --> 08:52.272
Awww look. Your boyfriend
sent a grunting telegram.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.856
It's not him.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.492
(groans)

09:00.165 --> 09:05.626
(groans)

09:05.838 --> 09:06.748
Heads it is.

09:07.381 --> 09:11.340
(g rowls)

09:11.552 --> 09:12.792
(grunts)

09:13.011 --> 09:14.296
(thunk)

09:16.014 --> 09:18.801
Sorry, I'm late.
Traffic was a bitch.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.386
Hey. You need new fridge?

09:23.605 --> 09:24.594
Uh, maybe.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.851
| get you good price
for this vending machine.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.147
Stop selling my stuff.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.645
Your cousin
just try to help.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.444
Well last time he tried to help,
someone stole my identity.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.236
Remember?

09:33.449 --> 09:34.609
A total misunderstanding.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.111
By the way if police call
about a string of bad checks

09:37.327 --> 09:38.407
best just to leave town.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.905
What have you done now?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.407
Total misunderstanding, yeah?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.033
Please, can we
stop this yelling.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.744
If I remember correctly, all
we do in this family is yell.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.045
Where have you been, Mom?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.463
Hello, hello.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.791
Heard if I'm lookin' for
a fine Russian princess

09:54.011 --> 09:55.421
this is the place.

09:55.637 --> 09:59.596
Hey, um, really
bad time. Gas leak.

09:59.808 --> 10:00.263
Gas leak.

10:00.476 --> 10:01.215
Killer rats.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.265
What's goin' on?

10:02.478 --> 10:03.809
My family's here.
Theyjust showed up.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.512
Okay, I'm nothing like them.
She's only my mother by birth.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.814
Kenzi, it's okay.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.266
I invited them.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.570
You did this to me?

10:16.825 --> 10:19.737
You think Harvey is
gonna be happy to see us?

10:19.953 --> 10:22.945
Well, I hunted down
his Mom like a dog

10:23.165 --> 10:26.032
then delivered her to
Hecuba prison, sooooo...

10:26.251 --> 10:28.708
Okay, you can wait outside.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.162
Thank you for coming.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.042
Well my partner
called so I came.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.418
Dyson...

10:34.635 --> 10:36.842
Hey, the D Man and l are
gonna go talk to the locals.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.137
See what they know.
You can go in with Acacia.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.930
Okay.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.228
Thanks, partner.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.597
Yeah.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.862
So you're the one who convinced
my Tamsin she could be more.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.408
Something wrong with that?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.485
Absolutely nothing.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.538
Tamsin really loves you, I
can see it in her baby blues.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.580
Mmhmm. But...?

11:07.793 --> 11:09.784
You get on the wrong
side of her again,

11:10.003 --> 11:12.540
I won't leave you with
enough chi to turn and cough.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.792
All I did was side
with The Wanderer

11:15.008 --> 11:17.590
because I had no choice.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.418
Sound familiar?

11:20.305 --> 11:22.842
Well, well, well.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.299
If it isn't my
favorite ball busting,

11:25.519 --> 11:27.760
overly-accessorized Valkyrie.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.399
So when'd you trade in
bitchy and blonde for a

11:31.608 --> 11:33.894
brunettte with bouncy
Christmas hams?

11:34.111 --> 11:35.692
Harvey...

11:35.904 --> 11:37.895
You're not still mad
at Tamsin 'cause she

11:38.115 --> 11:40.697
hogtied your mother?

11:40.909 --> 11:45.869
'Cause your mom was really
fat, she kinda had no choice.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.289
Hey. Water under the bridge.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.537
But if you do see that
little Nordic nut tease,

11:51.753 --> 11:54.130
you tell her she
can make it up to me

11:54.339 --> 11:57.172
with a little spit
and elbow grease.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.678
Hah.

12:03.348 --> 12:03.882
Aghhh!

12:04.099 --> 12:06.590
(groans)

12:06.810 --> 12:07.925
Oooh yeah.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.180
Oh yeah, baby.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.761
Make it good.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.188
Who owns the head, Harvey?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.482
Huh? Are you sure
it ain't one of yours?

12:15.694 --> 12:18.026
You two could be twins.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.193
Hey, hey.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.691
I got this.

12:27.497 --> 12:31.240
Hi. I'm Bo.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.746
The Succubus?

12:33.962 --> 12:38.672
Now why don't you tell us
what we want to know, Harvey?

12:38.884 --> 12:41.751
I'd do anything for you.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.552
And I'd do everything to you.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.783
Bottoms up.

13:15.671 --> 13:22.008
Mmm... Mmm.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.426
There's a fruity bouquet.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.051
Hints of cherry and manure.
He must have been scared.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.474
But it's hard to tell
the terror from the terroir.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.973
You were that kid in
school who spit in the

13:34.189 --> 13:35.770
air then catch it
again, weren't you?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.019
Drinking blood is the
only way to gain dominion

13:38.235 --> 13:42.319
over a revenant, or find
out who currently has it.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.232
Oh god. Quickly,
before I vomit.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.067
Do you know
who's behind this?

13:50.831 --> 13:55.165
Yeah, it ain't one of mine.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.789
Who owns this dead?

13:58.005 --> 14:02.965
Well, ain't that
the kicker, Succubus.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.336
This dead...

14:06.972 --> 14:08.178
belongs to her.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.939
This is your dead!

14:20.152 --> 14:21.232
Hands off the leather.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.025
That's my line.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.067
Ooh, cat-fight.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.520
Oh yeah, I might
have killed the guy.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.605
But I didn't raise
him from the dead.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.575
Pull her hair!

14:27.784 --> 14:28.944
You're nothing
but a hired killer.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.947
This evil shit is
right up your alley.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.621
Don't you even pretend
to know a thing about me.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.575
If I was here to kill anybody,
they would be dead already.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.829
I am that good.

14:39.046 --> 14:39.501
Boﬁng.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.793
Rip her shirt open.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.920
How you holding up?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.216
Never better.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.294
Are you lying to me?

14:49.514 --> 14:50.674
Never better.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.762
Well if it's any consolation
I think she's crazy.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.058
I am not crazy!

14:56.271 --> 14:57.556
Can we help
you with something?

14:57.773 --> 14:58.762
Help me! Help me!

14:58.982 --> 15:00.768
Oh, there can
be no help for me.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.851
But there may be--
there may be help for you.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.983
Long ago there were three
sisters and they were all magic

15:07.199 --> 15:09.906
but only one survived because
she could control the dead.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.574
She took her from me.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.779
She took her like a
shirt from a clothesline.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.784
Dead and alive.
Dead and alive.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.160
She was dead and alive.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.661
Hey. Wait. What did you say?

15:19.878 --> 15:20.913
She can control the dead.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.244
She is dead and alive.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.499
She took her from me.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.000
She took her from me!

15:25.217 --> 15:27.333
She's dead and alive. There
were three and there's one.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.928
And she is dead and alive.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.798
She is dead and alive.

15:31.014 --> 15:34.177
(grunts and panting)

15:34.392 --> 15:35.802
Ah. Punch her in the tit!

15:36.019 --> 15:38.385
What is going on?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.061
(together) Nothing.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.688
What's up?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.482
Dyson and I actually
found a lead.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.855
Some woman named Laveau.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.061
Hmpn

15:53.453 --> 15:54.784
(clash)

15:54.996 --> 15:55.405
(smash)

15:55.622 --> 15:56.452
Send me a bill.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.873
Mackenzie?

16:11.263 --> 16:13.470
Why are you so mad, baby?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.720
Are you seriously
going to ask me that?

16:17.936 --> 16:19.142
Look.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.767
I brought my earrings
that you love so much

16:22.983 --> 16:24.268
when you were a little girl.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.770
Aren't they beautiful?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.947
Your boyfriend
ruined my life, Mom.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.824
Bodgen, is a
complicated man--

16:38.039 --> 16:39.370
I know his name.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.416
Look, I know I make mistake.

16:42.627 --> 16:46.085
I know I drink too much
when you were a little baby--

16:46.298 --> 16:47.959
|-| should have protect you.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.086
l was just a little girl too.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.633
Please, Mom--

16:51.845 --> 16:55.633
I never believe that l have
the strength to stand on my own.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.932
| always think I need the man.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.932
l was a little girl, Mom.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.763
And l was
living on the street

17:07.652 --> 17:12.442
Do you know how long it took
me to... to feel normal again?

17:12.657 --> 17:13.407
I know--

17:13.617 --> 17:15.278
No. You don't know.

17:15.493 --> 17:20.954
And before I met Bo I lived
off what I could steal and l...

17:21.166 --> 17:23.908
l was in some situations
that not only am | ashamed of,

17:24.127 --> 17:29.087
but I just can't believe
that I even survived.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.415
I kick him out.

17:31.635 --> 17:32.124
What?

17:32.344 --> 17:35.051
Oh yes. He's gone.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.470
Yup. So long.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.259
When did that happen?

17:39.476 --> 17:40.386
Six months ago.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.433
But l-l didn't know
how to find you.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.763
But then when your nice
man, Hale, call, I think,

17:45.982 --> 17:46.971
l have to come.

17:47.192 --> 17:52.277
l have to come and
see my little Solnushka.

17:52.489 --> 17:57.984
You have the strength
of your father.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.943
God rest his soul.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.920
I've been really
worried about you.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.915
I thought one day he would...

18:14.344 --> 18:16.926
You did the right
thing. You did.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.089
Okay.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.923
lt's settled.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.135
Tonight... we celebrate.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.898
Oh, and uh, put
on something nice!

18:30.110 --> 18:31.145
So much black.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.852
You could be a
very pretty girl.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.873
Okay. So,
help me out here--

18:52.090 --> 18:53.580
The Wanderer
gets off the train

18:53.800 --> 18:57.418
and suddenly
starts playing house?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.173
What is it?

18:59.389 --> 19:02.256
Um, since he's come back,
since he got off the train--

19:02.475 --> 19:03.885
I've been remembering things.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.262
They're really fuzzy.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.093
What things?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.680
Well, I may have
given the Rainer's

19:09.899 --> 19:13.141
soul to the Blood King
after the great rebellion.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.101
I didn't take it to Valhalla.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.905
You put him on that train?

19:19.117 --> 19:22.780
I helped... make
him the Wanderer.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.111
We gotta take him out.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.070
Acacia--

19:25.290 --> 19:28.157
Oh, you know as well as I
do that that man is bad news.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.877
Just because he is
boning Sugar Snatch

19:30.086 --> 19:32.372
up there doesn't mean that
he's gonna leave you be.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.955
After what you've done.

19:35.175 --> 19:41.421
Jesus, Tamzy. Rainer's
revenants are after you.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.601
Charming place.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.433
Who is this Laveau anyway?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.816
She's a voodoo
priestess, child.

19:59.032 --> 20:03.071
And my gifts are at
your service, Succubus.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.071
You know me?

20:04.287 --> 20:06.278
Everybody knows you, girl.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.331
You took out the
high council of hate.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.285
And are involved
with a man of mystery.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.870
What do you know of it?

20:15.090 --> 20:19.333
I know you've felt that
crazy kind of love, Wolf.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.214
I've seen into
your animal heart.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.591
But when you gonna
see its prison is wholly

20:24.808 --> 20:26.924
of your own makin'?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.259
Okay, this is fun
and everything but,

20:29.479 --> 20:31.310
uh, we got a head in a bag.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.105
I'd like to find out
who sent it to kill me.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.103
You want me to
wake up the dead?

20:36.319 --> 20:37.525
(laughs)

20:37.737 --> 20:40.399
I wake up all the dead!

20:40.615 --> 20:45.780
(evil laugh)

20:45.995 --> 20:48.372
Massimo told me that he
built this from scratch,

20:48.581 --> 20:51.573
ugh dirty lying, son
of a, grave robbing--

20:51.793 --> 20:52.908
Watch out!

20:53.128 --> 20:55.460
(laughs)

20:57.924 --> 20:58.754
You!

20:58.967 --> 21:00.503
You're behind this!

21:00.718 --> 21:03.380
You have what
I seek, Succubus!

21:03.596 --> 21:05.052
Seek? Seek what?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.721
The Devil's horse.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.173
The Pyrippus is coming!

21:08.393 --> 21:10.805
And I need to protect myself.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.807
When the prize of the
five, was all made dead,

21:14.023 --> 21:18.437
their powers was sewn
into one. And | wants it!

21:18.653 --> 21:20.109
What are you talking about?

21:22.365 --> 21:23.070
(thwack, grunts)

21:23.283 --> 21:24.693
(thump)

21:27.120 --> 21:28.576
I'll get her feet.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.076
Wow.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.373
Oh wow.

21:34.586 --> 21:36.372
Galina, l have to tell you.

21:36.588 --> 21:40.251
That was one of the best meals
I've had in my entire life.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.377
Of course it was.

21:41.593 --> 21:42.833
My little Mackenzie help.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.758
Baby steps mom.
Don't over do it.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.006
Oh nonsense.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.429
You were always good
at making Oladyi dish.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.257
This one is going to
make you a very good wife.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.094
Oh my god. Mom!

21:54.314 --> 21:55.349
Ooh.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.272
I'm sorry, that's
embarrassing. (clears throat)

21:58.485 --> 22:00.225
Okay.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.312
Well, good
time as any I guess.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.237
Okay. Okay.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.317
Uh... (laugh)

22:08.536 --> 22:09.446
What?

22:16.085 --> 22:19.168
I wouldn't feel
right doing this

22:19.380 --> 22:21.917
without asking for
your mother's blessing.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.543
Oh my god.

22:31.893 --> 22:35.101
Just feel my heart, Kenzi.

22:35.313 --> 22:39.522
Whenever I'm around
you it loses control.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.817
From the moment we met
and I saw who you are

22:46.032 --> 22:49.240
I knew you were the one.

22:49.452 --> 22:52.865
Nobody makes me
laugh like you do.

22:53.081 --> 22:57.120
Nobody makes me want
to be a better man.

22:57.335 --> 23:00.122
No one does the exact
opposite of everything that I say

23:00.338 --> 23:01.953
like you do.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.424
Little Mama.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.173
Oh my god.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.179
Will you marry me?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.056
(phone rings)

23:17.272 --> 23:18.227
Hello?

23:19.148 --> 23:20.433
Dimka? Seriously?

23:20.650 --> 23:25.235
Sorry, it's Bodgen,
he wants to know can

23:25.446 --> 23:27.778
he expect money tomorrow
or will you wire tonight?

23:27.991 --> 23:28.946
(shushes him)

23:29.158 --> 23:30.568
Kinda in the middle
of somethin' here--

23:30.785 --> 23:31.740
What?

23:31.953 --> 23:33.693
Oh, well your father
he, uh, wanted to borrow

23:33.913 --> 23:34.777
some start up money.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.738
That man is not my father!

23:38.459 --> 23:39.244
You lied to me.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.745
Babe, it's not a big deal--

23:40.962 --> 23:42.498
Hale, it is a big deal, okay?

23:42.714 --> 23:45.501
If you know what's good for
you, you'll stay out of this.

23:45.717 --> 23:46.422
Get out.

23:46.634 --> 23:47.419
No, Solnushka.
Baby, please--

23:47.635 --> 23:49.250
No! Get out! Now.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.975
We found out who's
controlling the revenants.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.476
It was Laveau.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.604
She's also got Acacia doing
a little Evil Dead routine.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.105
We need your help.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.114
I guess your boys didn't get
us what we need, huh, baby?

24:15.330 --> 24:16.240
Mmhmm.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.286
We?

24:17.498 --> 24:21.537
(banging)

24:21.753 --> 24:25.166
(smash, groans)

24:25.381 --> 24:26.632
That'd be a no.

24:26.841 --> 24:27.796
Dyson--!

24:45.026 --> 24:45.776
Ah.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.100
Even though you're dead--

24:47.320 --> 24:50.107
you are still the hottest
bitch I've ever seen.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.154
Dead?

24:52.367 --> 24:54.904
There's no escape Succubus!

24:55.119 --> 24:58.577
Give us the Una
Mens seed or die!

24:58.790 --> 25:00.121
(smash)

25:00.333 --> 25:04.576
(groans)

25:04.796 --> 25:06.707
(growling)

25:06.923 --> 25:10.336
(groans)

25:16.140 --> 25:17.516
Dead!

25:17.725 --> 25:19.431
Those other bodies sitting
outside your trailer.

25:19.644 --> 25:20.759
Change of clothes?

25:22.313 --> 25:25.771
You're the "head"
revenant, aren't you?

25:25.983 --> 25:27.769
(slice) (gasps)

25:36.160 --> 25:38.742
The only way to gain dominion
over a revenant is--

25:38.955 --> 25:40.161
Oh.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.782
(whines)

25:51.843 --> 25:53.253
Eugh!

25:53.469 --> 25:55.005
She's all yours.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.429
Be at peace.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.057
(bodies clumping)

26:07.859 --> 26:11.602
Oh. Please tell
me you have a mint.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.158
Kenzi, please let me explain--

26:19.370 --> 26:22.407
No! All the horrible shit he
did to me and you did nothing.

26:22.623 --> 26:26.081
He wouldn't of done those things
if you weren't so defiant!

26:29.297 --> 26:31.754
You know I always
thought you were a victim.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.297
| always thought
you were scared.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.760
But you're not scared.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.925
You're just a coward
who doesn't value herself

26:40.141 --> 26:42.723
so how can she value
her own children.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.187
Goodbye.

26:57.700 --> 27:01.568
Listen, uh, you and this guy.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.951
He's, uh, good.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.827
Don't call it off.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.154
So, you want to talk about it?

27:38.366 --> 27:39.401
Not really.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.200
Be honest with me.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.573
You want me to be honest, huh?

27:45.790 --> 27:46.745
Yes.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.414
At least with Lauren
I knew she cared.

27:52.630 --> 27:53.745
This Wanderer, this--

27:53.965 --> 27:55.125
Rainer.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.294
I don't know
anything about him

27:58.511 --> 28:00.547
and neither do you.

28:00.763 --> 28:01.627
Dyson--

28:01.848 --> 28:04.464
How do you know he's not here
just to get back at Trick

28:04.684 --> 28:05.389
for cursing him?

28:05.601 --> 28:08.013
You have every
right to be hurt.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.810
Bo, I will always
be there for you.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.891
l'll will stand by you and
help you fight the bad guy.

28:16.112 --> 28:19.821
But if this guy,
if this... Rainer,

28:20.032 --> 28:22.318
if he turns out
to be the bad guy...

28:26.122 --> 28:28.408
I don't think I can
help you with that.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.124
You can't mean that.

28:34.672 --> 28:38.415
You and l, we were always
more than just lovers.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.794
I know.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.428
And what are we now?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.801
Look, this whole destiny
thing is hard to understand,

28:47.018 --> 28:50.101
believe me, I am having
trouble with it too.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.598
The man kidnapped you.

28:51.814 --> 28:54.271
No, he didn't.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.860
It wasn't like that.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.276
Then what was it like?

28:59.488 --> 29:01.695
It is a long story.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.448
Look, I would have stood
by you too, when l was...

29:08.664 --> 29:09.995
When you were what?

29:15.630 --> 29:17.621
Still in love with me?

29:22.970 --> 29:25.882
You can't always
choose your path, Dyson.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.354
You seem to.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.501
(laughing)

29:54.710 --> 29:55.870
No way!

29:56.087 --> 29:58.078
He actually stood on his
horse and threw the sword.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.460
And as the sword flew through
the air he used his mesmer

30:01.676 --> 30:03.917
to make the soldier
thrust his arms out wide

30:04.136 --> 30:08.049
and welcome the
sword into his heart!

30:08.265 --> 30:09.801
No way.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.598
It was legendary.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.645
What is that?

30:16.857 --> 30:17.767
My books.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.606
Rainer is being written
back into history.

30:22.822 --> 30:23.982
Literally.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.531
Listen. Thank you.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.075
And as much as
I love a good yarn,

30:30.287 --> 30:31.743
you know, like the March Hare.

30:31.956 --> 30:35.369
l'm late, I'm late for a
very important engagement.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.369
Vex.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.837
The seed?

30:39.046 --> 30:41.037
The sixth Una Mens seed.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.622
lt's missing.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.549
Someone's taken it from me.

30:45.761 --> 30:49.424
And of course you think l
have something to do with that.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.925
Did you?

30:53.811 --> 30:56.052
It's not too late, Vex.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.263
| see the good in you.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.643
| see your father in you.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.442
Whoever has that seed has
no idea what kind of power

31:03.654 --> 31:05.770
it can unleash.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.824
You can stop more suffering
than anyone's ever known.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.160
You see good in me, yeah?

31:15.499 --> 31:17.876
Well at least that
makes one of us.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.792
Vex, don't be a fool.

31:24.008 --> 31:27.216
Vex! Vex!

31:32.808 --> 31:36.300
It was really nice working
with you again, baby girl.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.054
Yup.

31:37.271 --> 31:38.977
It was a real eye opener.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.101
What do you mean?

31:41.317 --> 31:44.024
I love you 'Cache, and we've
been through a lot together.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.692
But we both know
that no one hired

31:45.905 --> 31:48.066
you to track down
the revenants, did they?

31:48.282 --> 31:49.863
What? Of course they did.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.737
You needed somewhere
to put the Tarot card.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.240
So I'd get my team on side
and we'd take The Wanderer out.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.412
What are you talking about?

32:02.713 --> 32:05.455
You know the things
he's capable of.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.585
You know the things he's done.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.167
I'm just not
a killer anymore.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.592
He took my hand.

32:10.805 --> 32:13.091
And if he is what I
think he is I will be the

32:13.307 --> 32:14.592
first person to
slit Rainer's throat.

32:14.809 --> 32:17.016
But I'm gonna do it right
this time, l have to be sure.

32:17.228 --> 32:19.435
What are you gonna do, Tamsin?

32:19.647 --> 32:22.184
Gonna go find
yourself a little wolf.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.309
Settle down.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.518
Squeeze out a
couple of puppies.

32:26.737 --> 32:27.601
Bye, 'Cache.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.187
Mmhmm. 'Kay, then.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.317
Oh, listen.

32:31.534 --> 32:34.446
You might want to keep
your wits about you.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.744
Massimo is up
to something big.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.492
Massimo's dead.

32:38.707 --> 32:42.871
And you and I both know that
dead don't always mean dead.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.769
Oh, hey. Look.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.268
This whole Rainer thing
I know it makes me look

33:05.484 --> 33:08.100
kind of insane, but I
have questions for him.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.230
I do.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.232
But I can't ignore howl feel.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.690
Sometimes you just
have to go for it. Right?

33:15.244 --> 33:16.279
Right...

33:18.455 --> 33:20.446
What the hell...?

33:23.794 --> 33:27.252
Hello. Who is
the historical hottie?

33:27.464 --> 33:29.000
What do you mean? It's Rainer.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.501
That's your boss.

33:31.802 --> 33:32.837
That's not my boss.

33:44.607 --> 33:46.222
Gotta hand it to you rich boy.

33:46.442 --> 33:48.774
You sure do know how
to pick out the bling.

33:48.986 --> 33:49.896
I'm sorry, Kenzi.

33:50.112 --> 33:50.976
Whoa!

33:51.197 --> 33:53.813
Put those away, sir!

33:56.577 --> 33:58.192
It was worth a shot.

34:06.086 --> 34:13.754
I think that we just
need to slow down a bit.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.802
Because we have
so much time, Hale.

34:17.014 --> 34:20.973
We have all the
time in the world.

34:21.185 --> 34:26.555
And | just... don't
want to be my mother.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.390
I don't want to rush
into things and feel trapped.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.771
And lose... me.

34:31.987 --> 34:36.071
I promised myself that
I would never do that.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.070
You're not lettin'
me down easy, are you?

34:39.286 --> 34:41.743
Are you crazy?

34:41.956 --> 34:46.325
Did you really think
that I would let the best,

34:46.543 --> 34:51.003
most amazing, wonderful
man l have ever met

34:51.215 --> 34:54.673
slip through my stupid,
stubborn fingers?

34:56.637 --> 34:57.626
Hmm?

34:57.846 --> 35:07.642
2’5;

35:07.856 --> 35:14.398
2’5;

35:15.072 --> 35:16.528
Ah!

35:16.740 --> 35:17.365
Oh my god.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.734
Thank god you are here.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.236
I mean today has just been...

35:20.452 --> 35:22.238
I don't even know
what is going on but--

35:22.454 --> 35:23.443
lam what's going on.

35:23.664 --> 35:24.870
Shazam!

35:26.000 --> 35:26.580
Oh my god!

35:26.792 --> 35:27.417
You and Hale?

35:27.626 --> 35:28.456
Yeah. Yeah!

35:28.669 --> 35:29.579
I mean yes!

35:29.795 --> 35:31.581
But l-- but I haven't
said yes yet. But...

35:31.797 --> 35:32.582
You said yet!

35:32.798 --> 35:33.878
I know. I know.

35:35.384 --> 35:36.920
That's crazy that I'm
even like considering this.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.344
No. No you are
not crazy. At all.

35:40.556 --> 35:41.170
Is he upstairs?

35:41.390 --> 35:42.140
Yeah.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.509
Oh no no!
No pants! No pants!

35:43.726 --> 35:44.715
Oh... Oh!

35:44.935 --> 35:46.015
(laughs)

35:46.228 --> 35:48.560
Okay. Well I'll go out
and get some... some snacks!

35:48.772 --> 35:50.637
And wine!

35:51.442 --> 35:51.851
And candy.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.102
And candy!

35:53.319 --> 35:53.933
Lots of candy.

35:54.153 --> 35:54.938
Okay.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.615
How're you doing there champ?

36:02.828 --> 36:05.535
Haven't felt this
alone in centuries.

36:05.748 --> 36:06.908
Feels good.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.286
Do you remember
that first day we met?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.416
At the boxing ring.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.375
I remember taking some
shots in the mouth, yeah.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.086
That's not all I
did to that mouth.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.226
Tamsin, I can't even
think straight right now--

36:33.442 --> 36:35.728
Stop thinking.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.730
You're always thinking.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.565
Come on.

36:45.287 --> 36:46.993
Come on.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.739
(whispers) Come on.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.166
(moans)

36:53.837 --> 36:54.917
Hey baby!

36:55.130 --> 36:57.416
Do you want
cheese or ice cream?

36:57.633 --> 37:00.249
Or should we put the cheese
directly into the ice cream?

37:00.469 --> 37:01.254
I like that idea.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.676
(gaSPS)

37:04.556 --> 37:06.547
Or you could
just die already.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.257
Hale! Ha--

37:09.478 --> 37:10.718
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.974
I never did like
the sound of your voice.

37:13.190 --> 37:13.394
Agh!

37:13.607 --> 37:14.722
(thump)

37:14.942 --> 37:16.523
(pantings)

37:16.735 --> 37:17.724
Ahhh!

37:17.945 --> 37:19.230
You and that stupid
bitch Succubus

37:19.446 --> 37:22.404
just couldn't leave
it alone, could you?

37:22.616 --> 37:25.358
You tried to kill me?

37:25.577 --> 37:27.829
Burn me alive?

37:28.705 --> 37:29.694
(grunts, screams)

37:29.915 --> 37:31.200
(coughing)

37:35.546 --> 37:38.162
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

37:40.926 --> 37:45.590
Now, I'm gonna make
you prettyjust like me.

37:46.223 --> 37:47.963
(gasping cries)

37:48.183 --> 37:49.719
Hale! (muffled grunt)

37:49.935 --> 37:54.395
(coughing, gasping)

37:54.606 --> 37:56.767
What's the matter kitten?

37:56.984 --> 37:58.815
Why don't you just
use your little sparkle

37:59.027 --> 38:01.109
and sparkle me away?

38:01.321 --> 38:03.061
Oh that's right, you can't.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.739
Because you are just
a pathetic little human

38:05.951 --> 38:08.488
just like me.

38:10.122 --> 38:14.365
(gasping)

38:14.585 --> 38:16.416
I hope you had a
good life, Druid.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.085
(grunts)

38:19.298 --> 38:19.753
No! Please!

38:19.965 --> 38:20.590
Gah!

38:20.799 --> 38:26.920
(grunts and fighting)

38:27.139 --> 38:28.424
(smash)

38:28.640 --> 38:31.928
(panting)

38:32.144 --> 38:35.386
(grunts and gasping)

38:38.275 --> 38:48.867
(screams of pain)

39:25.697 --> 39:27.073
(slice)

39:41.630 --> 39:46.340
No. Baby! Baby... (mumbles)

39:46.552 --> 39:49.635
"To Clan Zamora,
a gift bestowed,

39:49.846 --> 39:52.553
immune to evil deed, to blow.

39:52.766 --> 39:57.476
For he who carries sacred
twig. Immortality..."

39:57.688 --> 40:00.976
God the pentameter's so
awful I can't even finish.

40:04.820 --> 40:09.735
But this little baby has
saved my life twice now.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.736
Thanks for that big guy.

40:11.952 --> 40:13.692
Don't you touch him!

40:13.912 --> 40:16.028
You are right.

40:17.541 --> 40:20.499
I should be thanking you.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.714
Consider us paid in full.

40:46.111 --> 40:46.896
Breathe.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.443
You're okay.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.242
I love you.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.246
No, no.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.244
No no!

41:01.460 --> 41:03.246
Someone help me please.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.748
Please, anybody.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.465
Bo where are you?

41:07.674 --> 41:10.837
Where are you...? (crying)

41:11.053 --> 41:12.213
No!

41:20.145 --> 41:26.061
Kenzi! I hope you are done
'cause I want to get d-runk!

41:26.276 --> 41:29.643
Oh my god! Oh my god!

41:29.863 --> 41:31.399
What happened?

41:31.615 --> 41:33.981
Massimo.

41:34.201 --> 41:35.065
Massimo did this.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.401
He killed him.
And it's all my fault.

41:37.621 --> 41:40.533
Kenzi, what? No.

41:40.749 --> 41:43.161
Oh god, Hale!

41:43.377 --> 41:44.492
The twig.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.292
What, what are
you talking about?

41:46.505 --> 41:49.872
I gave it to
Massimo for my power.

41:50.092 --> 41:53.209
My stupid, stupid power!

41:53.428 --> 41:56.716
I did this.

41:56.932 --> 42:01.221
Bo. Bo, you can bring
him back. The chi thing.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.973
You can bring him back.
You have to bring him back.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.349
No Kenzi, I can't--

42:05.565 --> 42:08.227
Bo, when Dyson died after
the Dawning you sucked all

42:08.443 --> 42:11.651
of our chi and you brought
him back. Now bring back Hale.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.238
Kenzi--

42:12.447 --> 42:13.277
You have to do it!

42:13.490 --> 42:15.481
No Kenzi. There
isn't enough chi.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.363
Last time there was, Lauren,
and Trick, and Stella...

42:18.578 --> 42:20.534
And me. And me.
Take it from me.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.453
No. I can't lose you!

42:22.666 --> 42:23.951
You are so goddamned selfish!

42:24.167 --> 42:26.032
You say you always
want to help people

42:26.253 --> 42:28.164
but you only
ever help yourself!

42:28.380 --> 42:31.087
I will never forgive you.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.583
Do it.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.465
(gasping)

42:42.686 --> 42:44.551
Kenzi, I can't.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.386
I can't save him.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.106
Why?

42:47.315 --> 42:48.566
Because you'll die.

42:48.775 --> 42:49.605
I don't care.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.934
I do. I care.

42:52.154 --> 42:52.768
I choose you.

42:52.988 --> 42:54.103
I will always choose you.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.062
No! l was gonna say yes.

42:56.283 --> 42:58.114
l was gonna say yes!

42:58.326 --> 42:59.827
(gasping cries)

43:00.036 --> 43:02.448
I wanted to say yes.

43:02.664 --> 43:09.331
(crying)

43:09.546 --> 43:11.252
I know.

43:13.425 --> 43:21.719
(crying)

43:21.933 --> 43:24.094
I'm so sorry, Kenzi.

43:24.311 --> 43:25.676
I am so sorry.

43:25.896 --> 43:27.727
(crying)
