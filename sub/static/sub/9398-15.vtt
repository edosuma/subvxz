00:01.134 --> 00:02.965
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.329
Got it. Let's get out of here.

00:04.404 --> 00:06.531
Well, well. What do we have here?

00:06.606 --> 00:09.905
Principal Turner is just really pissed
right now and he's on a major witch hunt.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.807
<i>You're, like, prime suspect.</i>

00:14.481 --> 00:17.507
- Why would you do that?
- You're my friend, Brooke.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.946
<i>You know I love him.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:24.320
But I never meant for my love for him
to hurt you.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.380
Thank you, Peyton.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.449
I could kiss you forever.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.521
<i>I'm a Clean Teen.</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:31.154
I'm the Clean Teen.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.357
This was goodbye.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.866
<i>Chase is into smart,</i>
<i>born-again-virgin Brooke,</i>

00:34.934 --> 00:37.494
not stupid, slutty,
"I cheated on the calculus test" Brooke.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.731
I could easily have sex with him
if I wanted to.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.967
- Party!
- Party!

00:42.976 --> 00:45.103
That is for getting me fired.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.910
And that is for trying
to sleep with my husband.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.216
<i>Come on, I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

00:59.292 --> 01:01.260
<i>I would die if anybody saw this.</i>

01:01.327 --> 01:03.192
<i>Don't worry, nobody will ever know.</i>

- I think the lime went down my shirt.
- I'll get it later.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.183
Thanks, buddy.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.590
Hey, you're next. Get up there.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.959
Hey, baby, come here. I need a chaser.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.959
Why don't you spit
in my mouth next time?

01:42.035 --> 01:43.468
Lt'd be sexier.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.730
Hey.

01:45.872 --> 01:46.964
What is your problem?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.803
What, you mean,
why won't I let you mount me

01:48.875 --> 01:50.172
in front of the entire basketball team

01:50.243 --> 01:52.643
after you've already made out
with half the cheerleading squad?

01:52.712 --> 01:54.441
Yeah, pretty much.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.075
I am so sick of this.

01:56.149 --> 01:59.175
All you care about
is getting drunk and having sex.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.743
- Hey!
- Hey, you left out basketball.

02:02.188 --> 02:05.385
No. No, I left out
that you're an inconsiderate bastard

02:05.458 --> 02:06.652
and we are through.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.955
For ten minutes this time
or until tomorrow?

02:09.027 --> 02:10.824
I need to know how to plan my night.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.922
How does forever work?

02:12.999 --> 02:15.467
Now you can go screw
whatever skank you want.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.912
I'm drunk.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.710
Peyton dumped me.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.662
- So you guys really broke up?
- Yeah.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.723
- Need another drink?
- No.

02:50.537 --> 02:51.765
Never mind.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.237
You're good.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.274
Wait.

03:08.555 --> 03:12.514
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just having a little fun. Don't worry.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.359
- Promise you'll erase it.
- Done.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.198
<i>Hold on. No, I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

03:29.275 --> 03:32.108
<i>I would die if anybody saw this, Nathan.</i>

03:32.178 --> 03:34.703
<i>Don't worry, nobody will ever know.</i>

03:41.821 --> 03:44.119
Peyton, I don't know what to...

04:31.404 --> 04:33.304
Well, it could have been worse.

04:33.373 --> 04:37.742
You could have gotten your ass kicked
by a pregnant girl half your size.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.675
The day's still young.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.937
All right, so I have to ask.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.348
Who's really the big brother?

04:45.418 --> 04:50.720
Rachel, I can't believe I have
a black eye the day of prom.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.081
You know, if it wasn't for you,

04:52.158 --> 04:54.490
everybody would be calling me
Queen Slut right now.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.552
After I talk to Principal Turner,
you might just have the title.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.394
I have to get my punishment
for stealing the test.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.797
Maybe he'll spank me.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.462
I wish you'd let me go with you.
I'm the one who was failing.

05:04.537 --> 05:05.663
That's not a good idea.

05:05.738 --> 05:08.366
See, this problem calls
for little clothes and lots of flirting.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.500
And no one wants to flirt
with a one-eyed girl.

05:10.576 --> 05:11.975
No offense.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.570
Oh, didn't you see enough of Brooke
last night?

05:14.647 --> 05:17.241
Or you here for the deleted scenes?

05:19.352 --> 05:21.081
How you holding up?

05:22.288 --> 05:24.882
I never meant for it to happen, Luke.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.655
I was just really drunk

05:27.727 --> 05:30.560
and Peyton broke up with Nathan and...

05:30.630 --> 05:34.191
Did I mention
I was, like, really, really drunk?

05:36.402 --> 05:38.029
How mad is she?

05:38.104 --> 05:41.562
She was still pretty upset
when I left her last night.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.339
You think?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.537
Well, it could be worse.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.340
You could be Nathan right now.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.581
Haley, please come out.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.615
Hey.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.956
Why didn't you tell me about Brooke ever?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.225
Really, I mean, did you just wanna,
like, not ruin the surprise of me

06:05.298 --> 06:07.823
seeing it on tape
in front of our entire class?

06:07.900 --> 06:09.026
No, I didn't tell you

06:09.102 --> 06:11.764
because it happened a long time ago
and it didn't mean anything.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.602
If it didn't mean anything,
then why did you put it on tape?

06:14.674 --> 06:17.370
And why did... Why did you keep the tape?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.506
- Do you, like, use it?
- No! I forgot I even had it.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.006
I didn't tell you
because it happened before I met you.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.645
I didn't think it would do any good
to bring up the past.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.649
You know, this is just the worst time
for something like this to happen.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.818
- Because of prom tonight?
- Prom?

06:34.894 --> 06:37.988
Not because of prom,
because I'm pregnant and I'm hormonal.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.395
And you know what,
now that you mention it,

06:39.465 --> 06:42.366
I do have to go help decorate,
because I promised Brooke.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.903
- Haley, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.996
Welcome home, Mrs. Scott.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.069
I'm sorry I left the house like this.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.907
Whatever, Mom. Just clean it up.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.058
Still upset?

07:07.627 --> 07:11.063
No, something like that
you forget about pretty quick.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.531
Dumb question, I guess.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.124
Hopefully the prom will take
your mind off this whole thing.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.033
Yeah, that should be fun.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.163
Maybe my cheating ex-boyfriend
will ask me to dance

07:20.239 --> 07:23.072
or I'll get to share some punch
with my whore of an ex-friend.

07:23.142 --> 07:26.009
I know this sucks, okay?
But you shouldn't let it ruin the prom.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.046
No, it shouldn't, but it does.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.639
For what it's worth,
I saw Brooke this morning.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.014
And she feels horrible about it.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.418
So the first thing you did this morning
was go see Brooke?

07:36.489 --> 07:39.322
- It was on the way.
- You know what else is on the way?

07:39.392 --> 07:42.054
My front door. Shut it when you leave.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.490
That really did happen.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.093
I always kind of pretended
it was just a bad dream.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.924
No, it happened.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.897
I guess it's easier for you to remember it

08:19.966 --> 08:23.299
since you have a tape that you can watch
over and over and over again.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.394
I never watched the tape, Brooke.

08:25.471 --> 08:29.464
I didn't even know it was still around.
I just destroyed it this morning.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.703
Great. That's gonna help
everyone un-see it.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.573
I know. I'm sorry.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.541
It's not all your fault, Nate.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.244
I mean, my memory of that night's
hazy at best,

08:39.318 --> 08:42.515
but I'm pretty positive
you didn't have a gun up to my head.

08:42.587 --> 08:46.319
I know it was only two years ago,
but it just feels like a different lifetime.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.792
Hey, I know exactly how you feel.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.321
I'm not proud
of who I used to be either. God.

08:53.499 --> 08:54.761
How's Haley?

08:54.834 --> 08:57.325
I spent the night apologizing
to our bedroom door.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.495
And when she finally did come out,

08:58.571 --> 09:01.369
it was just to tell me
that she had to decorate for prom.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.464
Why aren't you there?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.702
Because Haley's there and Peyton's there

09:03.776 --> 09:07.371
and I'm gonna avoid seeing them
until the last possible second.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.746
All right, well,
I need to go make my rounds.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.785
I got a lot of apologizing to do today.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.822
- Yeah. I'll tell her you came by.
- No, don't.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.980
- Please.
- Okay.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.717
Anyway, like I said, I'm sorry.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.029
Me, too.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.727
I guess when you get drunk
and have sex at a party,

09:27.800 --> 09:30.496
you do have to deal with it eventually.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.871
Hey, Shelly. It's Mouth.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.469
Please call me back.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.672
It's Mouth.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.358
Sorry I'm late.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.957
That's what you're apologizing for?

10:02.902 --> 10:05.336
Well, I'm sorry about the other thing, too.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.464
Were you ever gonna tell me
about you and Nathan, ever?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.132
Honestly? No.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.735
Haley, we didn't even know
each other back then.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.404
And when am I supposed to bring
something like that up,

10:14.480 --> 10:18.382
at a basketball game? R-A-V-E-N-S.
PS, I slept with your husband

10:18.451 --> 10:20.214
- once a long time ago?
- I guess.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.412
You really shouldn't be upset.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.615
Nathan used to hook up with everyone.
Bad luck.

10:28.027 --> 10:31.690
Duck, duck, duck. Bitch.

10:33.332 --> 10:37.564
Peyton. Peyton, I'm so sorry, okay?
What else do you want me to say?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.867
Well, I want you to say,
"Punch me in the face again, Peyton.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.839
"Please. I deserve it."

10:42.642 --> 10:46.373
Okay, you're not
exactly perfect here either.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.744
That's right. You cut me out of your life,
made me feel guilty for kissing Lucas,

10:49.815 --> 10:52.409
when you had screwed Nathan
behind my back.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.112
And you guys were broken up.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.347
Keep telling yourself that
if it makes you feel better.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.289
But you're a backstabbing whore
and you know it.

10:59.358 --> 11:02.691
Hey! Good luck
with your cheating girlfriend.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.141
Hey, I just went to school to find you
and Bevin says you left.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.336
Well, Bevin doesn't know when to shut up.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.107
What are you doing?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.738
These are all the tapes that I could find

11:22.815 --> 11:24.282
because the thought of you
Brooke-ing yourself

11:24.350 --> 11:26.716
to yourself and Brooke
really makes me sick.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.185
Haley, there aren't any more tapes.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.518
Really? Because Bevin says
that you've been with a lot of girls.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.250
So I'm thinking
you probably put yourself on tape

11:32.324 --> 11:33.450
with at least one or two of them.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.926
Hey, Bevin doesn't know when to shut up.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.001
Okay, okay, you know what I want?
Here's what I want.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.833
I want a list of every girl
that you've ever been with.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.463
That way,
there won't be any more surprises.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.237
You want me to write a list
of every single girl I've...

11:52.912 --> 11:54.539
No, no, I guess not every single girl.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.776
You can cross Peyton, Brooke
and my sister off of that list.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.249
Hey, do you really think
that's a good idea?

11:59.318 --> 12:01.946
Yes! And you know what?
Here, I'll make it easy for you.

12:02.021 --> 12:03.045
Take the phone book

12:03.122 --> 12:06.114
and just cross off the name of every girl
you haven't been with.

12:06.192 --> 12:10.219
- I don't want to do this.
- Why? I can give you mine.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.388
You.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.829
See? That wasn't so hard.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.246
Hey.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.286
You were right,
I should have checked on you first.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.723
I'm sorry.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.325
It's okay.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.928
I like the red dress.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.899
You would. It's Brooke's.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.168
- Why do you have it?
- So she doesn't.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.868
Okay, don't you think stealing
Brooke's prom dress

12:56.942 --> 12:59.342
is going a little bit too far?

12:59.411 --> 13:02.938
No. I think going a little too far
is making your friend feel like a whore

13:03.015 --> 13:04.607
when you've done worse.

13:04.683 --> 13:07.174
Didn't we kind of do
the same thing to her?

13:07.253 --> 13:09.448
We had sex?
That's funny, I don't really remember.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.546
It must not have been very good.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.923
Look, we didn't have sex,
but we did sneak around behind her back.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.690
Do you ever actually defend
the person you're dating?

13:17.763 --> 13:20.323
Look, Peyton. I know you're upset, okay?

13:20.399 --> 13:22.731
But I also know
that you could take the high road.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.100
This is completely beneath you.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.907
Like Nathan beneath Brooke?
Or was that Brooke beneath Nathan?

13:38.717 --> 13:40.241
Can you hit it?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.848
- Hi, Brooke. You okay?
- Oh, I don't know.

13:46.458 --> 13:51.327
Is it okay that Million Dollar Bitchy gave
me a black eye the day of my senior prom?

13:51.397 --> 13:52.421
No.

13:53.132 --> 13:56.693
Is it okay that Peyton went after Lucas,
not once, but twice,

13:56.769 --> 13:58.464
while we were dating?

13:58.537 --> 14:00.664
- No.
- Yeah.

14:00.739 --> 14:04.903
Is it okay that she chased Chase off
by screaming at me in front of everyone?

14:04.977 --> 14:06.444
Chased Chase.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.707
- Why is this funny?
- It's not.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.477
Is there anything I can do?

14:11.550 --> 14:15.486
Yeah, actually. You could push Peyton
in front of a bus for me.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.451
I'm just gonna go over there.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.696
Please tell me one of those dresses
isn't Brooke's.

14:30.769 --> 14:35.206
No, actually. Dan is chaperoning the prom
and he's asked me to chaperone with him.

14:35.274 --> 14:40.940
Do... You wanna go to my prom with
the guy who left you right after yours?

14:41.013 --> 14:43.675
Look, we are just going as friends.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.485
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for my real mom.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.252
Look, I just thought it would be fun.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.587
But if this is gonna upset you,

14:54.660 --> 14:57.993
I guess I could just stay home alone
another night.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.525
I'm used to it. I've done it for 17 years.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.073
What are you doing?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.043
Oh, Nathan, I didn't hear you come in.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.709
It's no wonder I can't dance.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.844
- I take it you need something?
- Yeah, I need to talk to you.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.482
I screwed up. And if there's one thing
you know about, it's screwing up.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.081
You left out basketball.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.786
Dad, it's pretty bad this time.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.886
Daunte bad or failed-test bad?

15:30.963 --> 15:34.797
"Me and Brooke made a sex tape
a few years back and it just got out" bad.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.858
Brooke Davis. Nice.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.801
And now Haley wants me to write
a list of every girl I've ever slept with.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.502
Oh, no, bad idea.
That'd just make things worse.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.409
Give her some time, she'll calm down.
But do not write that list, Nathan.

15:47.479 --> 15:48.844
I wouldn't.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.176
I'll write the list.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.920
Oh, no, no,
I thought that's what you wanted.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.286
No.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.383
No, that's not what I wanted.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.452
I wanted you not to be able to write a list.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.294
How am I supposed to compete
with all the girls that you've been with?

16:09.368 --> 16:10.733
You don't have to compete
with all the girls.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.330
All the girls? How many girls
have you slept with, Fabio?

16:14.406 --> 16:16.271
I don't know, I never thought about it.

16:16.342 --> 16:20.540
Honey, that is why I asked you
to write the list in the first place,

16:20.612 --> 16:23.513
so please just do what I'm asking you to.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.120
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.385
Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.024
I was just thinking about what happened.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.465
It's okay.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.027
I'm sorry my past keeps coming back
to haunt us.

16:45.104 --> 16:49.336
I have a lot of skeletons in my closet,
and apparently half of them are naked.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.334
Yeah.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.972
I've been able to accept
a lot of your history, Brooke.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.947
But you know mine too.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.609
And you know that my best friend slept
with my girlfriend,

16:59.685 --> 17:02.245
just like you slept with Peyton's boyfriend.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.016
No, it wasn't like that.
They broke up and...

17:04.089 --> 17:07.752
I know prom's important to you,
so we can still go.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.420
But after that we can't be together.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.267
Then it should just be over now,

17:20.305 --> 17:24.138
'cause I don't wanna go to prom with
someone who doesn't want to be with me.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.240
You said no more surprises.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.748
I'm sorry.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.492
Open up, Peyton!

17:43.562 --> 17:45.860
Or what? You'll huff and puff
and blow my house down?

17:45.931 --> 17:48.695
Yes, pig. Chase broke up with me.
Are you happy now?

17:48.767 --> 17:50.098
I don't know. Did you tape it?

17:50.169 --> 17:52.399
That thing with Nathan and I happened
a long time ago, Peyton.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.768
And you guys were broken up.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.967
Well, in case you don't remember,
Nathan and I broke up all the time.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.907
Oh, really? How could I forget?

17:58.977 --> 18:01.343
That's all that your relationship
ever was, Peyton.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.109
Just a string of miserable one-night stands
thrown together.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.344
Now you're describing your life
with every guy in Tree Hill.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.546
It was one time. And it meant nothing.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.253
Well, it means something to Chase.
And it meant something to me.

18:13.325 --> 18:14.952
You know what meant something to me?

18:15.027 --> 18:18.121
You and Lucas having an ongoing affair
behind my back!

18:18.197 --> 18:22.395
Because PS, we weren't broken up
either time that you went after him.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.231
Okay. You're right.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.168
My fault.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.934
See, I was stupid
'cause I thought I ruined our friendship

18:29.007 --> 18:31.100
when you ruined it a long time ago.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.041
- We were never friends.
- Oh, give me...

18:36.548 --> 18:37.913
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.519
You're the next stop
on the Nathan Scott Apology Tour.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.987
I thought that tour was sold out.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.257
Are you pissed about the tape?

18:47.326 --> 18:51.160
No, actually, I was relieved to know
it wasn't you and Peyton.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.429
Could it have been you and Peyton?

18:56.502 --> 18:57.833
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

18:57.903 --> 18:59.837
Haley destroyed every other tape
in the house.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.770
Yeah, she's pretty upset, huh?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.240
Well, she's still talking to me.
So that's something.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.608
And so are you,
so does that mean we're cool?

19:07.679 --> 19:11.376
Oh, yeah, man. We're cool.
I already knew you were an ass back then.

19:12.784 --> 19:18.416
Oh, you know what? Speaking of,
our dad asked my mom to prom.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.584
Well, that explains the dancing.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.787
- Does she wanna go?
- Yeah.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.088
It's a bad idea, right?

19:26.165 --> 19:29.100
Well, six months ago,
I would have said hell, yeah.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.635
But now I'm not so sure.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.932
- Why? What's changed?
- Dan has.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.767
He took the blame for Daunte.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.432
I mean, he was willing to spend
the rest of his life

19:36.508 --> 19:37.805
in jail for something he didn't do.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.367
But does that change everything
he's done in the past?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.845
No. No, it doesn't,

19:43.882 --> 19:46.510
but if your mom was willing
to give him a second chance,

19:46.585 --> 19:48.610
then maybe you should too.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.351
I got a lot of other people
to apologize to, so...

19:52.424 --> 19:53.584
Yeah.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.628
Hey, your mom's pretty smart, Luke.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.423
And besides, it's her life.

20:07.005 --> 20:10.441
Man, you can't just leave a message
about not going to prom and just hang up.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.170
If Shelly's not going, I'm not going either.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.644
Oh, look, dog, I'm sorry about Shelly, man.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.907
But this is your last prom.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.846
You gonna just let some girl
take that away from you?

20:17.916 --> 20:20.077
She wasn't some girl. She was the girl.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.881
Yeah, she was the girl
that broke up with you,

20:21.954 --> 20:23.581
which means she wasn't the girl.

20:23.655 --> 20:24.883
This isn't making me feel any better.

20:24.957 --> 20:28.393
I ain't trying to make you feel better.
I'm trying to get you to go to prom.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.223
Look, Fergie and Junk, they going to prom.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.889
You think they got dates? No.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.061
I mean, prom ain't gotta
be about all that, dog.

20:35.133 --> 20:38.159
Maybe it's about just having
a good time with your friends.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.569
I never wanna hear the word
"friend" again.

20:40.639 --> 20:45.167
At my funeral, my tombstone will
probably read, "Marvin McFadden. Friend."

20:46.011 --> 20:50.675
Yeah, and that place probably gonna
be packed 'cause everybody love you, dog.

20:50.749 --> 20:56.346
Besides, it's probably better than
"Here lies Mouth. The guy was a jackass."

20:58.690 --> 21:00.021
You going to prom, man.

21:06.231 --> 21:09.257
- Is this how bag ladies get their start?
- Shut it, Squeaks.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.427
Thanks to Peyton,
Chase broke up with me.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.528
Oh, so it's her fault now?

21:13.605 --> 21:16.130
Didn't you F her BF
when you two were BFF's?

21:16.208 --> 21:17.698
They were broken up.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.801
Oh, maybe Chase just doesn't wanna go
to prom with someone

21:19.878 --> 21:21.368
who looks tougher than him.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.141
Oh, no, he said
prom had nothing to do with it.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.945
He said he'd still go with me,
but when it was over, so were we.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.349
Sounds like Cinderella.

21:27.419 --> 21:31.788
Except the prince is a virgin
and the pumpkin is, well, a fatter pumpkin.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.382
Yeah? Which evil stepsister are you?

21:37.562 --> 21:39.621
The one that got expelled.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.993
And, FYI, I think Turner might be gay.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.772
- Looking to get revenge?
- No.

21:54.212 --> 21:58.649
I'm just cleaning up around here.
This place seems dirtier somehow.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.384
Remember when we thought
how cool it'd be to hang out

22:01.453 --> 22:02.784
with the popular kids?

22:02.854 --> 22:05.015
I don't think I ever said that,
Mr. Lucas Sawyer.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.487
Somebody wrote that on my notebook.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.493
Oh, okay. How's Peyton?

22:10.529 --> 22:11.996
Not well.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.799
I don't get it, you know.
It's been two years.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.528
She's acting like it just happened.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.730
Lucas, she just found out about it.
For her, it did just happen.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.398
Still, she shouldn't be this upset.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.500
Luke, it sucks to be betrayed
by somebody that you love,

22:25.577 --> 22:28.478
but then to find out about it
in front of everybody is really humiliating.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.378
You need to be nice to her.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.047
Who says I'm not being nice?

22:33.118 --> 22:35.814
Well, however nice you're being,
it's not enough.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.548
You've gotta let her know
that you're there for her,

22:37.622 --> 22:40.420
and that you're nothing
like her ex-boyfriend.

22:40.492 --> 22:41.720
Noted.

22:43.261 --> 22:47.561
But for the record, Nathan's nothing
like her ex-boyfriend either.

22:50.402 --> 22:51.733
Noted.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.100
I heard you got expelled.

22:59.177 --> 23:00.303
I'm sorry.

23:00.379 --> 23:04.247
My parents are flying me first class
to meet them on vacation.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.250
I finally get to spend some time
with them.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.151
I just had to get kicked out of school
to do it. Again.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.314
Maybe that's why you do it.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.791
Aren't you gonna say
goodbye to everyone?

23:13.859 --> 23:17.454
Yeah. Oh, bye, Haley,
here's the tutor key I stole.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.966
Bye, Nathan, sorry for almost getting
your uncle killed.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.797
Bye, Lucas, sorry for actually
getting your uncle killed.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.565
And bye, Tree Hill High,

23:26.671 --> 23:30.129
I'm really sorry
about the whole time-capsule thing.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.143
No, I think I'll spare everyone
the goodbyes.

23:33.211 --> 23:34.940
When do you leave?

23:35.714 --> 23:38.774
- Booked on a flight tonight.
- So you won't be at prom?

23:38.850 --> 23:40.249
Don't look so sad.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.512
You'll barely notice I'm gone

23:41.586 --> 23:44.555
when you're dancing
with your hot new girlfriend.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.420
She broke up with me.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.391
I've always hated her.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.952
- You okay?
- Not really.

23:52.330 --> 23:56.027
- And now I have to go to prom alone.
- You won't be there alone.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.934
I told, like, five guys I'd go with them.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.867
Still, I would have loved to dance
with you one last time.

24:04.843 --> 24:08.210
I mean, the only dance we've ever had
was after the shooting

24:08.280 --> 24:11.147
and I'd kind of like to erase that one.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.808
Yeah, I would have liked that.

24:12.884 --> 24:16.980
God knows I haven't left
too many great memories behind.

24:17.055 --> 24:18.955
You left me with some.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.227
Thanks, Mouth. That means a lot.

24:32.938 --> 24:36.305
That Clean Teen girl doesn't know
what she's missing.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.146
Seriously? You are egging my house?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.710
Well, are you gonna give
my dress back to me?

24:49.788 --> 24:51.312
The guy at the store told me you had it.

24:51.389 --> 24:53.289
- Described you down to your bony ass.
- So go naked.

24:53.358 --> 24:56.293
Think of all the time you're gonna save
hooking up with someone else's boyfriend.

24:56.361 --> 24:57.885
You're one to talk.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.294
You are one to talk, Peyton.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.662
Okay, so you said
we were never friends, huh?

25:01.733 --> 25:03.860
Never meant anything to you?

25:04.402 --> 25:06.962
Fine! Wanna see something else?

25:07.038 --> 25:10.599
Here's a picture of you and Lucas
on my birthday!

25:10.675 --> 25:12.609
So who's the whore now?

25:17.883 --> 25:19.350
God! Stop!

25:20.752 --> 25:22.185
God, I'm...

25:22.754 --> 25:24.381
Quit it! Stop it!

25:25.023 --> 25:26.684
Oh, would you...

25:28.293 --> 25:31.126
God, stop, just let go!

25:31.196 --> 25:34.427
I'm the one with no boyfriend,
no prom dress and a black eye.

25:34.499 --> 25:38.162
You're going to prom
with the guy you love, so you win.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.101
Okay, Peyton, you win.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.039
Why do you even care anymore?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.476
Why do I care?

25:53.919 --> 25:57.787
Brooke, this has been
one of the worst years of my life.

25:57.856 --> 26:01.917
And I needed my best friend
more than ever and you cut me out

26:01.993 --> 26:04.393
because I was honest with you!

26:04.462 --> 26:07.898
- And you were never ever honest with me!
- Peyton.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.963
You made fun of my mom's death, Brooke.

26:11.937 --> 26:15.065
You knew her.
You cried with me when she died.

26:15.140 --> 26:20.544
And now you use her
as a punch line for a joke to hurt me.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.546
It hurt. It did.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.821
Not anymore,
'cause you and me, we're done.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.415
You're right. She's dead.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.823
As far as I'm concerned so are you.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.674
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:56.448 --> 27:00.885
Can we just put this whole thing behind us
and have a good time at prom?

27:01.486 --> 27:03.351
I'm not going.

27:04.422 --> 27:09.951
- Why? Did something else happen?
- No. I just don't care about prom.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.689
Oh, look, Peyton.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.859
We don't have to see Brooke.

27:14.933 --> 27:17.493
It'll be fun. I promise you that.

27:17.569 --> 27:21.369
It's not about Brooke.
I just really don't wanna go anymore.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.137
You can still go if you want.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.504
Look, I think
you're gonna regret not going.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.246
I know that I'll regret not going with you.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.082
I just can't. I'm sorry.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.592
Well, I really hope you change your mind.

27:44.396 --> 27:47.763
Because I'm coming back later
and I'm picking you up.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.961
And if you open that door,

27:51.836 --> 27:54.566
I know that you're gonna look beautiful.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.370
And that we're gonna have a great night.

27:59.644 --> 28:02.204
And if not, I guess I'm going alone.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.188
Here's the list.

28:18.263 --> 28:20.288
But it's not the list of every girl
I've ever been with.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.491
Well, what is it?

28:21.566 --> 28:24.091
It's the list of every girl
I've ever been in love with.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.659
And your name's the only one that's on it.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.637
- It's the only one that matters.
- Nathan...

28:27.706 --> 28:29.640
That other list would
have just been garbage, okay?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.233
From a person that I'm not proud of.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.476
That's really sweet.

28:37.949 --> 28:40.679
- But I...
- But you want the other list.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.152
I thought you might.

28:55.433 --> 28:59.369
Wow, you're actually leaving.
I guess I should be packing, too.

28:59.437 --> 29:03.203
- Why? I didn't invite you.
- No, because this is your house.

29:05.443 --> 29:06.933
This is your house, isn't it?

29:07.011 --> 29:08.945
You didn't, like, marry
and kill some old guy

29:09.013 --> 29:11.675
- and bury him in the basement?
- I wish.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.877
My parents won't be back for a while.
So you have some time.

29:15.954 --> 29:19.219
I feel really guilty.
You got expelled for something I did.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.424
Please. I practically forced you to cheat.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.861
Besides, for me, getting expelled
equals getting tan.

29:26.531 --> 29:29.830
You had more to lose
with your Clothes Over Bro's deal.

29:31.169 --> 29:32.830
Thank you, Rachel.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.466
I don't know why you did it, but thank you.

29:38.543 --> 29:41.239
I did it 'cause you're my friend.

29:41.312 --> 29:45.078
Now do something for me,
and make things right with Peyton.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.084
Yeah, but she said I was dead to her.

29:47.152 --> 29:50.212
Do you blame her?
You're wrong and you know it.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.449
- You slept with her boyfriend.
- They were broken up.

29:52.524 --> 29:55.118
Who, broken up or not, is off-limits.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.295
Then you wouldn't forgive her
for doing the same thing to you.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.694
Well, fine.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.857
If that's not the skank
calling the whore a slut.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.595
You hit on Nathan,
knowing he was married.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.762
I know. But I suck.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.170
You're better than that. Work it out.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.333
It's no fun being the girl with no friends.

30:11.409 --> 30:14.003
Yeah, it's no fun being the girl
without a boyfriend either.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.443
No kidding.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.739
What's with the Clean Teens anyway?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.979
I mean, first Shelly dumps Mouth.
Then Chase dumps you.

30:21.052 --> 30:24.078
They should have a new slogan.
"We break hearts, not hymens."

30:24.155 --> 30:27.022
But... Shelly broke up with Mouth?

30:27.792 --> 30:31.250
I saw him this morning.
He didn't say anything.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.921
He probably didn't want to pile
onto your problems

30:32.997 --> 30:35.488
the way Peyton piled onto your face.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.502
But he's pretty broken up about it.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.597
That's my limo.

30:45.743 --> 30:49.179
Thanks for being my friend,
you cheating whore.

30:49.247 --> 30:52.182
Thanks for being my friend,
you crazy bitch.

30:54.352 --> 30:59.790
- Sorry I got you expelled. Again.
- That's okay. I'm used to it.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.088
Rachel.

31:08.032 --> 31:12.332
Okay, I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.772
Yeah. You too.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.304
I think you should wear this one.

31:49.874 --> 31:53.571
- Listen, I'm sorry I got weirded out earlier.
- That's okay.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.910
When he asked me,
that was my initial reaction too.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.472
And my second. And my third.

31:59.550 --> 32:02.713
- So why'd you agree to go?
- Oh, I don't know.

32:02.787 --> 32:04.277
I thought it would be fun.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.652
I just...

32:08.293 --> 32:10.818
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

32:12.196 --> 32:16.132
But if going to prom with Dan
is gonna make you happy,

32:16.200 --> 32:18.168
then you should go.

32:18.236 --> 32:23.003
You know, there was a small part of me
that was hoping you'd tell me not to go.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.932
I still could.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.536
I'll be fine.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.475
Okay.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.778
But no slow dances, okay?

32:51.502 --> 32:55.131
- Name him Nathan?
- Why? Did he screw my best friend?

32:55.206 --> 32:58.698
I'm sorry, okay? And I know I'm late.
I should have been here two years ago.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.836
- Well, why weren't you?
- Because I was a jerk.

33:02.347 --> 33:03.780
Why Brooke?

33:04.415 --> 33:07.441
- Did you really hate me that much?
- No, I didn't hate you.

33:07.518 --> 33:10.954
I just didn't care
about anybody but myself.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.148
Look, I hooked up with Brooke

33:12.223 --> 33:14.214
because she was drunk
and I was a bastard.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.192
It didn't mean anything.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.455
Just a mistake we both wanted to forget.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.019
Explains why you taped it.

33:20.098 --> 33:22.498
Well, did I mention I was a stupid jerk?

33:23.801 --> 33:26.827
- Now, look, when you get to prom...
- I'm not going.

33:28.806 --> 33:31.775
Hey, I know you're mad at me and Brooke,
but don't take this out on Lucas.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.904
I'm not. I just don't care.
I'm you two years ago.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.575
No, you're not. You never were.

33:40.651 --> 33:44.143
Why do you think you stayed with me
when I treated you so bad?

33:44.222 --> 33:47.817
- I'm a masochist.
- Because you cared. That's who you are.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.261
You care about Lucas
because you know he loves you.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.888
And you probably still care
about me and Brooke

33:53.965 --> 33:56.695
because you know we love you, too.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.134
Just face it, Peyton. You care.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.371
So get dressed, and go with Lucas.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.137
I'll see you there.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.902
Look like you made the right call, Mouth.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.069
I guess so.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.610
But I always thought I would lose
my virginity to my prom date,

34:41.679 --> 34:44.112
not my prom date to my virginity.

34:45.049 --> 34:47.745
But at least I have my friends, right?

34:57.328 --> 35:00.297
Will you go to prom with me,
Marvin McFadden?

35:00.832 --> 35:04.461
- What about Chase?
- Hey, don't ask about Chase, fool. Go.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.938
Clean Teens isn't really for me.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.537
Of course, I'll go with you.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.914
Looks like we'll be a Not-So-Clean couple.

35:16.981 --> 35:20.212
See, Mouth,
being a friend sometimes pays off.

35:21.219 --> 35:24.746
Who says we're going as friends?
Just go with it.

35:25.823 --> 35:27.586
See you guys there.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.293
- What's he got that I don't?
- A date.

35:50.448 --> 35:51.676
Haley?

35:52.216 --> 35:53.808
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.547
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to move in.

35:56.621 --> 35:58.384
- It means a lot to me.
- Yeah, sure.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.822
I mean, you know, you're family, Deb.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.861
If you wanna get better,
we are here to help.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.998
I also wanted to tell you

36:08.065 --> 36:10.625
that whatever stupid thing
Nathan might have done,

36:10.701 --> 36:12.931
I'm possibly to blame for it.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.535
Trust me, this one is all Nathan.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.369
His only role models growing up

36:17.441 --> 36:22.276
were a spineless, alcoholic mother
and a controlling, sociopathic father.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.042
That doesn't excuse everything
that he does, though.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.175
No, of course not.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.583
But he's become a wonderful man.

36:30.154 --> 36:32.281
And it's all because of you.

36:32.356 --> 36:36.793
And I want to thank you for that
and ask you to forgive his shortcomings.

36:37.628 --> 36:40.563
Whatever grace he has,
he learned from you.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.591
Maybe you can return it.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.332
Have fun tonight.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.144
My mother'll be out in a second.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.018
I know this is tough for you, Lucas,
but you can trust me.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.488
I trust her.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.790
- Wow, you look beautiful. Wow.
- Wow, you look great.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.194
Well, thank you, both of you.

37:14.465 --> 37:15.864
You're not ready yet.

37:15.933 --> 37:19.096
Oh, well,
only old people go to prom early, Ma.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.536
Well, save your mom a dance, would you?

37:22.139 --> 37:25.370
Sure. You know, 'cause every kid
wants to dance with his mom at prom.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.968
You're not every kid. You're my kid.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.849
And have a good time at prom, Mom.

37:34.652 --> 37:35.744
Dad.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.600
Thank God.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.103
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

37:57.675 --> 38:01.202
- Notice anything different?
- You're smiling.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.639
Anything else?

38:05.416 --> 38:07.281
Your boot's off.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.580
Haley, that's great. You can walk on it?

38:09.654 --> 38:12.452
Yeah, even better, I'm gonna dance on it.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.517
I was gonna tell you last night,
but your surprise kind of trumped mine.

38:16.594 --> 38:19.154
- Sorry. Again.
- I know.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.798
- And the list?
- The list...

38:26.137 --> 38:28.833
I just read the one written
by the man I fell in love with.

38:28.906 --> 38:32.034
I didn't need the one written
by that other boy.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.080
You know how much I love you?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.513
You better.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.187
- We're gonna be late for prom.
- Oh, please.

38:51.262 --> 38:54.459
Nothing wrong with being a little late,
is there?

39:07.111 --> 39:10.274
Oh, hey, does this dress
make my butt look big?

39:10.948 --> 39:13.974
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks, baby!

39:15.086 --> 39:17.418
Don't walk with me, dude.
People are gonna think we're together.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.321
Please. You could never get
with Fergie-licious.

39:20.391 --> 39:23.292
- Did you just say...
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.258
It was really awful.

39:25.329 --> 39:28.492
Peyton looked through me
like I didn't even exist.

39:28.566 --> 39:32.593
I mean, can't she hate me?
At least if she hates me, she still cares.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.070
You guys have been friends
longer than me and Luke.

39:35.139 --> 39:38.404
- I mean, that's too long not to care.
- Yeah.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.273
I'm sorry,
I'm always venting to you, Mouth.

39:40.344 --> 39:41.902
Do you wanna talk
about Shelly or something?

39:41.979 --> 39:44.038
- Not at all. No.
- Okay.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.678
If you do, I'm here.

39:47.318 --> 39:51.584
Thanks again for being my date.
You've always been there for me.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.751
Even now, when everyone thinks
that I'm a whore.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.656
Nobody thinks that.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.896
Oh, my God!

40:03.267 --> 40:06.202
You might wanna step out
of the black light.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.629
She cares.

40:10.941 --> 40:12.374
She cares!

40:18.315 --> 40:22.843
Oh, you two look so cute.
Wait there while I get the video camera.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.613
Sorry. You okay with this?

40:25.689 --> 40:27.623
I so broke that camera.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.728
Lucas, I...

41:45.135 --> 41:46.500
Hi, Peyton.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.528
