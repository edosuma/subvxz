KLAUS:
<i>Over the course of my life,</i>

00:53.120 --> 00:55.726
<i>We encountered no shortage
of those who would presume</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:58.460
<i>to speak of good and evil.</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:04.302
<i>Such terms mean nothing.</i>

01:07.267 --> 01:10.908
<i>People do what is
in their best interest,</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:13.574
<i>regardless of who gets hurt.</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:18.822
Is it evil to take
what one wants,

01:18.979 --> 01:22.119
to satisfy hunger
even if doing so

01:22.282 --> 01:24.159
will cause another's suffering?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.264
What some would call evil

01:26.420 --> 01:28.491
I believe to be
an appropriate response

01:28.655 --> 01:32.000
to a harsh and unfair world.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.661
No offense,
but I'm not sure I follow

01:33.827 --> 01:36.103
why you've
invited me here.

01:37.297 --> 01:39.004
Because I enjoy your company,

01:39.166 --> 01:40.839
and I sense you have
the capacity

01:41.001 --> 01:44.813
for understanding
someone of my complexity.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.111
You see, I returned
to New Orleans

01:47.274 --> 01:50.016
to investigate a threat
posed against me.

01:50.177 --> 01:52.179
What I found was
a young woman,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.826
pregnant,
in need of protection.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.359
My brother,
always the do-gooder,

01:56.516 --> 01:58.860
tried to manipulate me
into helping her.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.498
He thought it might redeem me.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.361
Trouble is,
I've since learned

02:02.522 --> 02:06.299
of another young women,
a girl really,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.963
one with vast potential,

02:09.128 --> 02:11.473
held in captivity by a tyrant.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.013
I want to help both of these women.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.207
Protect one and free the other.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.217
So tell me, Cami.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.323
Does that sound evil to you?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.892
I don't believe in
evil as a diagnosis.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.996
I think you have unstable
personal relationships,

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
stress-related paranoia,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.323
chronic anger issues,
fear of abandonment.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.996
I think you could benefit from
talking to someone professionally.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.571
I think I prefer to talk to you.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.580
So I'm going to offer you a job

02:49.736 --> 02:52.842
as my stenographer.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.849
Okay.
What are we writing?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.511
My memoirs of course.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.680
Someone should
know my story,

02:59.846 --> 03:01.257
and it will give us time
to discuss

03:01.415 --> 03:03.190
other riveting subjects,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.853
like your handsome suitor Marcel.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.692
Excuse me.
My private life is--

03:07.854 --> 03:10.027
Your private life is,
as it turns out,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.033
essential to my plans.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.604
You see, Marcel wants you,

03:14.761 --> 03:16.434
and because of that,
he will trust you,

03:16.596 --> 03:18.439
which serves me.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.774
The thing is
the French Quarter

03:21.935 --> 03:23.778
is on the verge of war.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.043
On the one side, there's me,

03:27.207 --> 03:28.618
and on the other, Marcel,

03:28.775 --> 03:33.281
along with a very powerful witch
and an army of vampires.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.619
What?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.726
You're frightened.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.895
Don't be.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.203
I'm not scared anymore.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.766
That's amazing.
How did you--

03:52.933 --> 03:54.412
It's called compulsion.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.047
It's a neat bit of vampire trickery.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.273
I'll tell you all about it,

03:58.438 --> 04:03.888
but first, let's talk
a little more about Marcel.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.088
MARCEL: <i>Suckers resilient.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:14.824
He's like a cockroach
in a suit.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.992
Doesn't matter. Time to give
old Elijah back to Klaus anyway.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.661
You asked me to figure out
how to kill the Originals.

04:20.827 --> 04:21.930
I'm not done.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.167
Silver dagger hurts them,
but that's it.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.676
Davina, we've been through this.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.678
Klaus saved my life.
I owe him one.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.144
Since he wants his brother back--

04:32.239 --> 04:35.152
Tonight's the annual
Dauphine Street Music Festival.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.309
I want to go.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.116
Please.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.350
The whole point of you
being up here

04:40.514 --> 04:42.016
is so you're never spotted out there.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.151
You know who works smack in
the middle of Dauphine street.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.524
Sophie Deveraux,
pain-in-the-ass witch,

04:46.686 --> 04:48.859
and you know what the witches
will do to you if they find you.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.365
But you control the witches.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.696
Make her go away.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.166
Marcel, it's one night.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.669
I said no.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.038
I do anything you say,

04:59.199 --> 05:02.510
but sometimes,
I think you forget what I'm capable of.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.711
Did you know I can make
someone's blood boil?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.978
All I have to do is focus.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.014
(HISSING, FIZZLING)

05:23.623 --> 05:25.159
(CHUCKLES)

05:29.162 --> 05:31.164
Fine.
We compromise, all right?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.242
You going out, alone,
too dangerous,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.744
but I'll introduce you to a friend
of mine that's gonna be there.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.640
All right?
Nice lady.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.706
You two are really gonna hit it off.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.516
Hello, Cami.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.262
How is it that when
you come up to me now

05:54.421 --> 05:55.695
and no one else is around

05:55.856 --> 05:57.927
I suddenly remember
that you just told me

05:58.091 --> 06:00.537
you're a vampire and
you're mind-controlling me.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.367
And then you leave,
and I go back to thinking

06:02.529 --> 06:04.440
you're just some hot guy

06:04.664 --> 06:07.611
with a cute accent and money to bum
on your sprawling memoir?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.940
Well, that's how
compulsion works, love.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.605
Yeah, but what's happening?

06:11.771 --> 06:14.081
Is it hypnosis, are my neurons
being shut down somehow?

06:14.241 --> 06:16.084
You're always the curious scholar.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.753
Let's talk about Marcel.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.789
You said you have
a little information for me.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.453
He's bringing someone
to the music festival tonight,

06:26.620 --> 06:27.928
a girl he's mentoring.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.567
Apparently she's going
through a hard time,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.225
rebelling against authority,
anger issues,

06:31.391 --> 06:32.563
that sort of thing.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.796
I guess with my
psych degree

06:33.960 --> 06:36.463
he figured I could set her straight,
but I said no.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.768
I'm gonna go ahead
and insist

06:37.931 --> 06:40.468
you change
your answer to yes.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.743
You're gonna force me
to do this, aren't you?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.048
Why even bother with politeness?

06:51.611 --> 06:52.817
Because I like you.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.329
I like the way your mind works.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.993
Under different circumstances,

07:01.154 --> 07:02.599
I think we might be friends.

07:04.324 --> 07:07.737
However, I don't have the luxury

07:07.894 --> 07:09.805
of passing up
tonight's opportunity.

07:11.164 --> 07:15.135
You see, in addition to being Marcel's
rather potent secret weapon,

07:15.302 --> 07:18.647
this girl Davina
is holding my brother captive.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.018
In other words,

07:23.176 --> 07:25.156
the girl needs your help.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.814
Call Marcel,

07:26.980 --> 07:29.859
tell him you'll be happy to oblige.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.525
Hold you, Agnes,
I feel great.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.257
You are overdue for a checkup.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.804
What am I gonna do, pop into
the Quarter for a quick ultrasound?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.669
A pregnant werewolf
escorted by a witch?

07:43.830 --> 07:45.138
Nothing to see here.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.039
A lot of women
would kill to have a child.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.044
Strikes me as odd that
you're not taking better care of yours.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.945
(TYPING)

07:52.305 --> 07:56.310
I know a doctor out in the bayou,
off the beaten path.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.649
Now, I took the liberty
of making an appointment

07:58.812 --> 08:02.385
for you tonight.
After hours, just us.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.859
Vampires will never
get word of it.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.697
Okay. Fine.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.996
Bayou baby doctor it is.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.166
Please, sister,
tell me you're not still at it

08:20.333 --> 08:21.403
with the Internet search.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.047
How does one begin anyway,

08:23.203 --> 08:24.910
just type in "anonymous attic"?

08:25.071 --> 08:26.209
Someone has to find Elijah,

08:26.373 --> 08:29.252
even if I have to search
every bloody attic in New Orleans.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.410
Like looking for a needle

08:30.577 --> 08:32.523
in a rather large pile of needles.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.082
I remember details about
the attic Marcel took me to.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.921
There were shutters
on the windows

08:37.082 --> 08:38.255
behind Elijah's coffin.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.523
Well, that should
narrow it down immensely.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.894
Myself, I prefer actual strategy

08:43.056 --> 08:45.058
as opposed to mind-numbing labor.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.102
Marcel's delay
in returning our brother

08:47.260 --> 08:51.106
makes me suspect he's no longer
in charge of the situation.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.268
If Davina's loyalty to Marcel is strained,

08:54.434 --> 08:58.780
perhaps the young witch
will be open to discussing a new alliance.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.111
As usual, your power grabs
are more important

09:01.274 --> 09:02.947
than rescuing your brother.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.784
I prefer to think of it <i>as</i> killing
two birds with one stone.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.051
Rob Marcel of his secret weapon...

09:09.716 --> 09:11.889
...bring our brother home.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.633
Hey, Diego.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.471
Right. So... any way to fast track

09:27.634 --> 09:30.478
the whole getting a daylight ring thing?

09:30.637 --> 09:33.140
You get a daylight right when you
get invited to the inner circle.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.082
For you, it may never happen.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.812
Yeah, but there's an opening, right?

09:37.977 --> 09:40.651
I mean, now that Thierry's, like,
you know--

09:40.814 --> 09:42.418
You shut up about Thierry,
all right?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.822
He didn't deserve what he got.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.088
Marcel was just showing off for Klaus.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.128
(DOOR OPENS)

09:47.153 --> 09:49.463
Can't wait till his
ancient ass is out of here.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.602
You and me both.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.759
Look alive, boys.
We got ourselves

09:52.926 --> 09:55.634
one high-class Original vampire.

09:55.795 --> 09:56.933
A real charmer.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.770
What if I told you that
I could help you out

09:58.932 --> 10:02.072
with your Klaus problem in exchange
for the tiniest bit of gossip?

10:03.069 --> 10:04.275
Like what?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.008
You might have heard the rumors
that Marcel and I

10:06.106 --> 10:08.143
were quite the item back in the day.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.343
He seems to have moved on,

10:09.476 --> 10:11.114
and I would like to know with whom.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.145
(TUTS)

10:12.679 --> 10:14.352
You've seen him with the bartender.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.017
What, that plain Jane
that he carries on with?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.857
Well, only a blind man
would choose her over me.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.021
There must be another girl in his harem.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.700
Look. I just need the
tiniest bit of closure,

10:27.861 --> 10:29.169
and then I can leave
New Orleans,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.172
and I'll be sure to take Klaus with me,

10:31.297 --> 10:34.141
which, let's face it,
would make your life a whole lot easier.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.673
Look.
Marcel's got a full plate.

10:39.839 --> 10:40.977
If he's seeing some other honey,

10:41.174 --> 10:42.482
she's somewhere in the Quarter.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.553
She's probably close by.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.817
And that, my lady, is all I got.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.374
Big event tonight,
a lot of people drinking,

11:03.530 --> 11:04.565
a lot of eyes watching.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.903
I don't want any trouble,

11:06.065 --> 11:07.339
which means no witches.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.570
Send word through the Cauldron.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.476
Any witches come here, we kill them.

11:10.537 --> 11:11.914
And while we're at it, no Originals.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.040
I don't like how Rebekah's
been snooping around.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.416
I got my girl Cami coming,
her and a little friend of hers.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.352

as a case of poor alliances.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.281
You're loyal to Marcel,

26:18.377 --> 26:21.381
and yet he keeps you
tucked away in an attic.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.895
Surely you'd prefer
just a little bit more freedom,

26:26.085 --> 26:29.157
and yet Marcel keeps you prisoner.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.823
Marcel doesn't keep me prisoner.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.593
He keeps me safe.

26:32.724 --> 26:33.725
He's my friend.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.828
Well, I have no doubt he is,

26:35.994 --> 26:40.773
but for a girl caught in a war
between the witches and the vampires,

26:40.833 --> 26:42.471
I might be a better friend.

26:44.169 --> 26:47.275
I would keep you safe,

26:47.439 --> 26:49.680
and I'd allow you your freedom.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.283
If Marcel could do that,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.153
why hasn't he done so already?

26:56.315 --> 26:59.194
And it does beg the question,

26:59.351 --> 27:01.490
if Marcel can't protect you,

27:01.653 --> 27:03.530
then what of those you care about?

27:03.689 --> 27:06.693
If anyone tries to hurt
anyone I care about,

27:06.859 --> 27:07.860
I'll kill them.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.334
Well, then,

27:09.495 --> 27:12.965
sounds like you don't need Marcel at all.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.976
Perhaps you've suspected it all along.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.809
Your dear friend Marcel tricks you

27:18.971 --> 27:20.541
into doing his bidding,

27:20.706 --> 27:24.882
and all the while,
you rot in an attic alone...

27:26.111 --> 27:29.320
...while young Timothy
moves on with his life.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.461
You feel that?
(HISSING, FIZZLING)

27:32.384 --> 27:34.455
That's your blood starting to boil.

27:42.027 --> 27:45.008
Such a shame to lose him
just as you found him again.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.509
And I really did admire
your skill with that violin.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.305
Don't you dare hurt him!

27:50.369 --> 27:52.076
Well, I hope I won't have to, sweetheart,

27:52.237 --> 27:54.740
but then that depends on you.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.486
Let him go now!

28:04.550 --> 28:07.497
You should know
I don't do well with demands.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.593
Impressive,
but you don't want to fight me, love.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.263
Innocent people have a way
of winding up dead.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.601
Please let me go.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.539
Your choice, little witch.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.940
Swear allegiance to me alone,
and the boy lives.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.073
Stand against me...

28:33.345 --> 28:35.086
Aah!

28:47.226 --> 28:48.466
Unh!

28:50.529 --> 28:51.769
Unh!

29:17.990 --> 29:19.333
How'd you find me?

29:19.491 --> 29:21.937
Your text got me halfway.
Vamp hearing did the rest.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.095

What terrible guilt
you'll have to live with,

31:37.129 --> 31:39.905
young Timothy's blood
on your hands.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.066
Get away from him!

31:41.233 --> 31:43.235
Now, now, let's not be hasty.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.645
After all, I can heal him.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.579
All you have to do...

31:52.878 --> 31:54.414
...is ask.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.956
Please.

32:04.122 --> 32:07.763
For you, Davina, with pleasure.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.849
You will forget everything that
happened after the concert,

32:28.013 --> 32:32.621
including the fact
that you saw Davina.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.025
What? No.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.689
If he remembers
seeing you,

32:36.855 --> 32:38.198
he might come looking.

32:38.356 --> 32:39.460
If the witches learn of him,

32:39.624 --> 32:40.659
if they know you have a weakness,

32:40.826 --> 32:42.806
then poor Tim might end up
as leverage

32:42.961 --> 32:46.841
in an awful scheme
to control you again.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.672
Okay. Come on.
Up you come.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.648
Take your violin case
with you.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.377
You'll remember losing the instrument
backstage after the performance.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.818
You really should be more careful.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.717
All fixed.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.624
Now, you owe me a favor.

33:24.569 --> 33:25.741
MARCEL: Davina.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.679
What happened?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.012
What are you doing here?

33:30.141 --> 33:32.143
I live her, remember?

33:47.259 --> 33:49.261
Wow, you abandoned
your quest for power

33:49.427 --> 33:51.100
to help out your family.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.435
Having an off day?

33:52.597 --> 33:54.599
- Who took her, Rebekah?
- I don't know.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.042
What do you mean you don't know?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.613
Then who killed her attackers?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.750
I don't know.
I had an arrow in my heart.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.376

who killed them, then...

34:04.843 --> 34:06.914

34:07.779 --> 34:10.783
Lovely. Perhaps her cousins
will know where she is.

34:17.054 --> 34:20.059
Hayley, what happened?
Tell me what happened.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.571
I can't remember.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.437
You've completely healed.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.804
There's not a scratch on you.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.072
One of the perks
of being a werewolf, remember?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.976
No.
Not that fast.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.742
Leave her alone.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.712
It's the baby,

34:38.810 --> 34:42.815
the vampire blood,
Klaus' blood in your system.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.722
It can heal any wound.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.755
Your own child healed you.

34:49.788 --> 34:50.960
How did you escape?

34:51.056 --> 34:53.502
You were outnumbered, unarmed.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.934
Those men were ripped to shreds.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.336
I think it was the wolf.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.136
I think it's trying to protect me.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.440
The witches were
supposed to protect you.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.641
When I get my hands
on Sophie Deveraux--

35:07.772 --> 35:09.115
It wasn't Sophie.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.275
It was Agnes.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.013
Fine. Agnes, Sophie.
It's all the same to me.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.179
I'll slaughter the lot of them.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.620
Not if Elijah gets there first.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.952
Elijah?

35:18.783 --> 35:19.853
Did you find him?

35:20.018 --> 35:22.521
He's been in touch,
and he has a plan.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.530
All he asked is
that we take care of you.

35:31.997 --> 35:35.968
Hey.
So, can we go home now?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.876
I'd really like to sleep
for a few days.

35:41.006 --> 35:41.882
Whoa!

35:43.808 --> 35:46.982
I've got you, love.
I've got you.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.701
I was crystal clear.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.461
Eyes on my girls
at all times.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.731
Well... Girl's little friend
sneaks away from your party,

36:03.895 --> 36:05.340
and that's our fault?

36:05.497 --> 36:08.068
What, Marcel, you gonna send
me to the garden now, too?

36:08.199 --> 36:09.507
(CRACK)

36:16.241 --> 36:17.584
When he wakes up,

36:17.742 --> 36:19.415
tell him that an apology
would have gotten him

36:19.577 --> 36:21.250
a lot further than his attitude.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.097
Awful what happened
at the church.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.927
I hear they're
calling it a gas leak.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.500
Such a Pity-

36:32.557 --> 36:34.935
I heard that you were quite
the woman on a mission today.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.232
What can I say?
I want Elijah back.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.432
Is that all you want?

36:40.732 --> 36:42.871
You'll get Elijah back.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.775
In the meantime,
stay out of this bar

36:44.936 --> 36:46.711
and stay away from my guys.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.111
What's wrong?
You jealous?

36:48.273 --> 36:50.412

my queen.

36:50.575 --> 36:53.784
Cami, the bartender?

36:53.945 --> 36:56.585
Stop fooling yourself, Marcel.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.125
She's comfort food.

36:58.283 --> 37:01.196
Something to distract you
from what you really want.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.129
Which, after all these years,

37:03.288 --> 37:04.631
is impossible to deny

37:04.789 --> 37:07.633
because I'm standing
right in front of you.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.274
(DOOR CLOSES)

37:28.913 --> 37:30.085
Klaus?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.455
What are you doing here?

37:32.617 --> 37:34.119
I've had quite a night.

37:37.822 --> 37:41.895
I recall you mentioned something
about nightmares and insomnia.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.303
I believe I can help.
May I come in?

37:45.463 --> 37:48.740
This is super weird.
Come in.

37:51.736 --> 37:52.908
Wait.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.313
That's right.
I told you what happened.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.476
I never tell anybody,
but I told you...

38:03.014 --> 38:04.755
...and you said something
about Sean

38:04.916 --> 38:07.260
standing alone against his demons.

38:07.418 --> 38:08.658
When he killed those men,

38:08.820 --> 38:10.265
I thought he must be mentally ill,

38:10.421 --> 38:14.767
but what if it was demons?

38:14.926 --> 38:16.837
What if a vampire compelled him?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.838
And if so,
would you devote yourself

38:18.997 --> 38:21.307
to finding the guilty party?

38:21.466 --> 38:25.209
Would you sacrifice everything
to find out the truth?

38:25.970 --> 38:29.315
To what end?

38:29.474 --> 38:32.011
This is the entire reason
I'm in New Orleans.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.783
Cami, whatever lies on the
other end of this mystery

38:34.946 --> 38:37.222
will only offer you pain.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.486
Nothing will bring your brother back.

38:40.618 --> 38:44.498
Your only hope for peace
is to forget this.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.636
- No.
- And move on.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.236
No.
Don't compel me to forget this.

38:48.393 --> 38:50.498
And if I allow you to remember,

38:50.662 --> 38:52.573
the knowledge will eat away at you.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.904
Your quest for truth
will only put you in danger.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.978
You don't care about me!

38:58.136 --> 39:00.241
You just want me to forget this
so I can be focused on Marcel,

39:00.405 --> 39:03.318
so I'll be a good,
little spy for you.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.579
I need your loyalty, yes,

39:05.743 --> 39:07.154
and, though that
may appear selfish to you,

39:07.312 --> 39:10.054
the scope of my plan
goes far beyond myself.

39:10.215 --> 39:14.027
Power aside,
I am trying to honor my brother.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.499
What about my brother,

39:18.656 --> 39:21.432
my twin brother?

39:21.526 --> 39:24.598
We were bonded our whole lives,

39:24.696 --> 39:29.770
and I know...
I know he didn't just snap,

39:29.934 --> 39:31.675
and I need to know who did this,

39:31.836 --> 39:34.442
and I need to make this right.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.109
No.
Don't take this away from me!

39:39.277 --> 39:40.688
You will do nothing.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.791
Your bother was ill.

39:42.947 --> 39:46.019
He killed those people
and himself,

39:46.184 --> 39:47.686
and it was a tragedy.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.024
All you can do...

39:51.956 --> 39:53.697
...is move on.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.440
Know that your brother
is at peace

40:07.605 --> 40:10.381
and that you needn't worry.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.544
I will find out what happened,

40:13.711 --> 40:16.214
and when I do,

40:16.381 --> 40:20.090
I will make sure
whoever harmed your brother...

40:21.085 --> 40:22.894
...will suffer.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.826
And as for you,

40:26.991 --> 40:29.972
tonight, you will sleep,

40:30.128 --> 40:34.577
