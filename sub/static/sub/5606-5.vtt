WEBVTT

00:04.318 --> 00:06.119
Feeling the burn, Danny?

00:06.121 --> 00:08.021
No, I'm tasting
the burn.

00:08.023 --> 00:11.158
Remind me to never eat breakfast
tacos before a five-mile run.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.293
Actually, we've only
gone three miles.

00:13.295 --> 00:15.062
You'd know that if you were
wearing one of these.

00:15.064 --> 00:17.731
This gives your heart rate, too.

00:17.733 --> 00:19.733
I'm guessing yours
is dangerously high.

00:19.735 --> 00:21.902
No, no, my heart's fine.

00:21.904 --> 00:23.937
It's my head
that needs to be examined.

00:23.939 --> 00:25.739
Who talked me into this?
Why am I doing this?

00:25.741 --> 00:27.474
Because it's fun and
it's for charity.

00:27.476 --> 00:30.710
And if by some act of God you
manage to finish the race,

00:30.712 --> 00:32.244
you can feel good
about raising money

00:32.247 --> 00:33.780
for the Widows
and Orphans Fund, okay?

00:33.782 --> 00:35.449
Well, next time
I'll write a check, how's that?

00:35.451 --> 00:36.817
All right,

00:36.819 --> 00:38.385
a little less yapping
and a little more running.

00:38.387 --> 00:39.653
Let me ask you
a question.

00:39.655 --> 00:41.521
Why are you in the car?
I just had bone marrow

00:41.523 --> 00:43.223
taken out of my body.
How'd you get out of this?

00:43.225 --> 00:45.659
Where's your empathy, brother?
I got arthritic knees.

00:45.661 --> 00:48.095
Besides, I got a note
from my doctor.

00:48.097 --> 00:50.630
- Yeah, how much you pay for that note?
- Not a penny.

00:50.632 --> 00:53.400
But he did agree to join my
coaching staff. Matter of fact,

00:53.402 --> 00:54.768
there he is,
right there.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.538
Yes, when, uh, Captain Grover
told me that you guys

00:58.540 --> 01:00.874
were participating in
the Tough Mudder charity event

01:00.876 --> 01:03.310
I happily offered my
services as team doctor.

01:03.312 --> 01:04.678
I will also be your

01:04.680 --> 01:06.146
strength and conditioning coach.

01:06.148 --> 01:07.848
Okay, well, you have your work
cut out with this one.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.349
No doubt.
And

01:09.351 --> 01:11.418
I apologize in advance
for what I'm about to do to you.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.620
Doctor.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.989
Whoa. Wai... Hey, hey.
Jeez!

01:15.991 --> 01:17.557

Okay, stop, Max.

01:17.559 --> 01:19.059
Ah! Max, cold, cold, cold!

01:19.061 --> 01:21.261

01:23.798 --> 01:27.734

All right,

02:13.382 --> 02:16.082
Up, up, up, up.

02:16.084 --> 02:18.018
Tough Mudder
is a team sport.

02:18.020 --> 02:21.721
And as we all know,
a team is only as strong

02:21.723 --> 02:24.624
as its weakest link.
So, Williams,

02:24.626 --> 02:26.326
you're up first.
Why? I don't want to do it.

02:26.328 --> 02:28.728
He just said he'll do it. So
why are you telling me to do it?

02:28.730 --> 02:30.897
Oh, come on, a little mud's
not gonna kill you, Danny.

02:30.899 --> 02:31.965
Yeah, you got this, Danny.
No, I don't got it.

02:31.967 --> 02:33.033
I don't want to do it.
All right,

02:33.035 --> 02:34.434

02:36.538 --> 02:38.471

gets the hose.

02:38.473 --> 02:41.007
I'll take the hose.

02:41.009 --> 02:43.877
Three, two, one.

02:43.879 --> 02:47.147
All right!

This is the videotaped
deposition

Mr. Kevin Harper,

Thanks.

06:48.044 --> 06:50.245
Hello?

Hello?

06:55.519 --> 06:57.986
Catherine?

07:14.571 --> 07:16.771
Okay, well, what makes you think
it was Catherine?

07:16.773 --> 07:18.540
Well, it was an international
number but there was

07:18.542 --> 07:20.141
no country code,
which means the call

07:20.143 --> 07:21.609
probably came from
a satellite phone.

07:21.611 --> 07:23.878
Plus I got two other calls
just like it recently.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.580
Okay, what if it was Doris?

07:25.582 --> 07:27.916
I don't know, maybe.
But I can't trace the call

07:27.918 --> 07:29.751
anyway, so there's
not much I can do.

07:31.588 --> 07:33.555
So the vic's name
is Kevin Harper.

07:33.557 --> 07:35.690
He was about to be deposed
as part of a civil lawsuit

07:35.692 --> 07:37.759
when all this went down.
His wife

07:37.761 --> 07:39.327
and his daughter were sitting
there in the waiting room,

07:39.329 --> 07:41.663
saw the whole thing happen
right in front of 'em.

07:53.576 --> 07:54.909
All right.

07:54.911 --> 07:57.145
Killing a guy before
he's about to go on record.

07:57.147 --> 07:58.680
Timing can't be a coincidence.

07:58.682 --> 08:01.683
Harper was a defendant
in this lawsuit.

08:01.685 --> 08:04.652
He owned a bunch of high-end
seafood joints,

08:04.654 --> 08:06.654
but all his partners
and investors sued him

08:06.656 --> 08:08.757
for embezzlement when
some money went missing.

08:08.759 --> 08:10.458
Right, that's
a lot of angry people.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.861
But why go through the trouble
of suing somebody

08:12.863 --> 08:15.196
if you're just gonna kill him
before you get your money?

08:15.198 --> 08:16.965
Well, unless they were
trying to stop him from saying

08:16.967 --> 08:18.500
what he was about to say
in his deposition.

08:18.502 --> 08:20.835
Well, I don't know, but I
tell you what I do know:

08:20.837 --> 08:23.838
Harper contracted a private
security firm to seek protection

08:23.840 --> 08:25.473
for himself and his family.

08:25.475 --> 08:27.275
They drove him here
this morning, but they

08:27.277 --> 08:29.711
didn't accompany him upstairs.
Okay, so that leaves

08:29.713 --> 08:31.946
a-a pocket of time
when he was unguarded.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.782
All right, well, aside from
the fact that it looks cool,

08:33.784 --> 08:36.885
why drive a motorcycle through
a building to kill somebody?

08:36.886 --> 08:39.788
Fastest way in and out of here.
Building protocol demands

08:39.789 --> 08:42.090
the entire building be shut
down in the event of a breach.

08:42.092 --> 08:45.093
That includes
elevators and exits.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.795
Okay, well, if that's the case,
how did our shooter

08:46.797 --> 08:48.229
get out of here?

09:02.511 --> 09:04.279
All right, lock down
the building now.

09:28.070 --> 09:29.871
VIN number's been removed
from the bike.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.673
CSU's gonna take it
apart back at the lab,

09:31.675 --> 09:33.341
see if they can find
any identifiers.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.477
Well, if our shooter ditched the
bike on purpose, I'm guessing

09:35.479 --> 09:37.745
we're not gonna find anything.
Yeah, we searched

09:37.747 --> 09:39.514
the building and HPD's
canvassing the area,

09:39.516 --> 09:41.182
but no sign of him.

09:41.184 --> 09:42.951
Yeah, he was gone even before
the engine even got cold.

09:42.953 --> 09:44.719
Well, I'll keep you posted.

09:44.721 --> 09:46.988
All right,
thanks.

09:49.024 --> 09:50.358
You know I'd say
Evel Knievel

09:50.360 --> 09:52.760
did it, but he's
been dead for a little while.

09:52.762 --> 09:54.829
Well, you know, whoever it was,
they needed to be carrying

09:54.831 --> 09:56.898
60 to 70 miles an hour
to make that jump.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.399
Then they needed
to stick the landing

09:58.401 --> 09:59.801
without breaking their face.

09:59.803 --> 10:02.003
Given that skill set,
I'm guessing that our shooter

10:02.005 --> 10:04.539
was actually a very
expensive gun for hire.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.040
Yeah, not a lot
of margin for error.

10:06.042 --> 10:09.377
Somebody went through a lot
of trouble to silence our Vic.

10:17.759 --> 10:20.773
We're very sorry to have to put
<i>you through this, but we need</i>

10:20.873 --> 10:22.606
to ask you some
questions, okay?

10:23.875 --> 10:25.308
Now,
your husband

10:25.310 --> 10:27.410
recently contracted
a private security company.

10:27.412 --> 10:29.613
Was that because
he'd been threatened?

10:32.583 --> 10:34.417
Okay, look, we know
that your husband

10:34.419 --> 10:36.787
was accused of embezzling money
from his business

10:36.789 --> 10:38.155
and there were a lot
of angry investors.

10:38.157 --> 10:41.591
Mom, you should tell them.

10:41.593 --> 10:43.293
Tell us what?
What's going on?

10:43.295 --> 10:45.495
Uh, you're right.

10:45.497 --> 10:47.764
My father
had received threats.

10:47.766 --> 10:50.100
But not
from

10:50.102 --> 10:52.302
any of the investors.

10:55.006 --> 10:58.208
Kevin was being forced
to pay...

10:58.210 --> 10:59.810
protection money.

11:01.512 --> 11:02.646
Forced by whom?

11:02.648 --> 11:05.916
He said it was
the Samoan mob.

11:05.918 --> 11:07.751
He had to pay
them money

11:07.753 --> 11:09.953
every week just to keep
the restaurants running.

11:09.955 --> 11:11.288
So that's how the money

11:11.290 --> 11:12.823
goes missing from the business.

11:12.825 --> 11:15.625
He fully intended to
pay all that money back.

11:15.627 --> 11:16.993
But before he got the chance,

11:16.995 --> 11:18.495
the accountants
audited the books.

11:18.497 --> 11:20.997
It's not like he could tell them
where the money was going.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.499
You have to understand.

11:22.501 --> 11:25.769
They threatened Kevin's life,
they threatened our family.

11:25.771 --> 11:29.039
But with the lawsuit
moving forward,

11:29.041 --> 11:30.807
we were out
of options.

11:30.809 --> 11:32.843
It's okay.
So let me get this straight.

11:32.845 --> 11:34.611
That's-that's what
today was about?

11:34.613 --> 11:36.780
Kevin was gonna come clean
in the deposition today

11:36.782 --> 11:38.548
about the protection money,
is that right?

11:38.550 --> 11:41.685
We fully understood

11:41.687 --> 11:44.621
what the repercussions
of this would be.

11:44.623 --> 11:46.623
That's why I made him
hire the security.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.491
I just...

11:48.493 --> 11:49.593
I just never imagined

11:49.595 --> 11:50.927
that something like
this would happen.

11:50.929 --> 11:52.596
Listen, we really

11:52.598 --> 11:53.897
appreciate your time.

11:53.899 --> 11:55.065
We're gonna do everything we can

11:55.067 --> 11:56.633
to find out who's responsible
for this, okay?

12:01.339 --> 12:03.173
All right, I get it.

12:03.175 --> 12:05.942
Samoans clip this guy
because they do not want him

12:05.944 --> 12:08.078
to go on record
about the protection money.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.180
But I got a hunch that

12:10.182 --> 12:11.581
they did not
do it themselves.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.116
They hired somebody
to do it. Why?

12:13.118 --> 12:14.384
They are perfectly capable.

12:14.386 --> 12:16.386
First of all, it's a way
around the security detail.

12:16.388 --> 12:18.488
And second of all, doing it
mid-deposition sends a message.

12:18.490 --> 12:20.523
Right. You snitch, you die.

12:41.712 --> 12:43.747
Chin Ho Kelly.

12:43.749 --> 12:45.115
How's it, Mike?

12:45.117 --> 12:46.750
How you doing, man?
All right.

12:46.752 --> 12:48.818
How you like
your new ride?

12:48.820 --> 12:51.221
Well, 120 miles per charge.

12:51.223 --> 12:53.790
Zero to 60 in five seconds.
It's not bad.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.258
Well, now that
you've gone green,

12:55.260 --> 12:57.961
why don't you reconsider the
offer I gave you on that Bobber?

12:57.963 --> 12:59.129
Sorry, brother.

12:59.131 --> 13:00.997
That Knucklehead's
the first bike I ever got.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.165
She's not going anywhere.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.234
You never forget your first.

13:04.236 --> 13:05.902
That's right.

13:05.904 --> 13:07.904
Now what can I do for you?

13:07.906 --> 13:11.574
Well, there's this case
I'm working.

13:11.576 --> 13:15.178
Wow, that's one tricked-out crotch-rocket.
Mm-hmm.

13:15.180 --> 13:16.846
Any idea where
it may have been customized?

13:16.848 --> 13:19.749
Not in any legitimate
shop, that's for sure.

13:19.751 --> 13:21.318
Frame sliders,

13:21.320 --> 13:24.821
rear handbrakes,
slip-on exhaust.

13:24.823 --> 13:26.189
Not exactly street legal.

13:26.191 --> 13:29.292
At least once a week,
some kid comes in here,

13:29.294 --> 13:31.995
wants the exact same setup.
Yeah?

13:31.997 --> 13:34.064
Why is it in such high demand?

13:37.636 --> 13:41.838
<i>808 Road Warriors</i>
<i>are a collective</i>

13:41.840 --> 13:43.239
of local stunt riders.

13:43.241 --> 13:44.774
They use social media

13:44.776 --> 13:47.077
to organize flash
mob-style events where

13:47.079 --> 13:49.245
they shut down traffic
and perform their tricks.

13:49.247 --> 13:51.314
They have no respect
for drivers, pedestrians,

13:51.316 --> 13:53.516
or clearly, the law.

13:53.518 --> 13:55.752
Yeah, I get it, 'cause,
uh, riding that motorcycle

13:55.754 --> 13:57.454
like a normal person
isn't dangerous enough.

13:57.456 --> 14:00.323
Okay, other than
these bikes being modified,

14:00.325 --> 14:01.558
how does this connect
to our shooter?

14:01.560 --> 14:02.692
Well, believe it or not,

14:02.694 --> 14:04.294
these guys are
actually linked

14:04.296 --> 14:07.030
to a series of
truck hijackings.

14:07.032 --> 14:08.465
Each job is
pulled off by

14:08.467 --> 14:10.100
a five-man team
of motorcyclists

14:10.102 --> 14:11.267
armed with MAC-11's.

14:11.269 --> 14:13.370
Well, that's the weapon
our shooter used.

14:13.372 --> 14:15.338
Mm-hmm.
All right, so, the Samoans hire these guys

14:15.340 --> 14:16.473
to take out Kevin Harper.

14:16.475 --> 14:17.774
That's what I'm thinking,

14:17.776 --> 14:19.275
except for the fact that HPD

14:19.277 --> 14:21.578
can't get a positive ID
on any of the hijackers.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.313
All they can
ascertain is that

14:23.315 --> 14:25.648
they are indeed members
of the 808 Road Warriors.

14:25.650 --> 14:28.051
All right, Kono's

14:28.053 --> 14:30.153
working the Samoan
angle, so, until we hear

14:30.155 --> 14:32.122
back from her, this is our
line of attack, all right?

14:32.124 --> 14:33.957
Let's round up as many
of these punks as we can

14:33.959 --> 14:35.825
until we find one that knows
something about the hijackings.

14:35.827 --> 14:37.227
One step ahead
of you there.

14:37.229 --> 14:39.963
A few of these guys had their
bikes seized recently by HPD.

14:39.965 --> 14:41.831
I managed to get them tagged
with GPS

14:41.833 --> 14:43.400
before they were released
from impound.

14:43.402 --> 14:44.801
Well, that's good.

14:44.803 --> 14:47.137
Next time one of these things
goes down, we'll be there.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.711
Let me ask you
something, sista.

14:54.713 --> 14:57.547
Does it look like I can ride
a motorcycle off a building?

14:57.549 --> 14:59.182
We're not saying
that you killed him yourself.

14:59.184 --> 15:00.950
We're just saying
you ordered the hit.

15:00.952 --> 15:02.419
And why would I do that?

15:02.421 --> 15:04.120
Because you're a bagman
for the Samoan mob.

15:04.122 --> 15:06.523
And Kevin Harper was about
to go on record

15:06.525 --> 15:08.124
that you were extorting money
from his business.

15:08.126 --> 15:11.327
Bagman? So you
think every Samoan

15:11.329 --> 15:13.963
with some ink on their
arm is a criminal?

15:13.965 --> 15:16.866
Nice try.

15:16.868 --> 15:21.171
See, HPD's been up
on you for weeks.

15:21.173 --> 15:23.807
And right now,

15:23.809 --> 15:27.477
they're decoding what appears
to be your ledger.

15:27.479 --> 15:29.512
You recognize that, don't you?

15:29.514 --> 15:33.249
So, you understand that with
or without his testimony,

15:33.251 --> 15:34.451
you were going down.

15:34.453 --> 15:35.852
Just now, we can add conspiracy

15:35.854 --> 15:39.022
to commit murder
to your charges.

15:39.024 --> 15:41.424
I realize I have
a credibility problem here.

15:41.426 --> 15:43.126
But you got to believe me.

15:43.128 --> 15:45.328
This, uh, Harper dude
that you keep on mentioning?

15:45.330 --> 15:46.463
I've never heard of him.

15:46.465 --> 15:48.398
And I sure as hell
never had him killed.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.135
I don't suppose there's any way
you can prove that?

15:56.941 --> 15:59.075
Yup. Yup.
I got it.

15:59.077 --> 16:00.510
Thank you.

16:00.512 --> 16:04.247
CIU just finished decoding
Laulu's ledger.

16:04.249 --> 16:06.916
Kevin Harper's name
isn't anywhere in it.

16:06.918 --> 16:08.651
I'm sorry.
You're telling me

16:08.653 --> 16:10.687
the Samoans were not taking
protection money from him?

16:10.689 --> 16:11.888
No. According to Laulu,

16:11.890 --> 16:13.423
they stayed away
from large businesses.

16:13.425 --> 16:16.092
There was too much risk that
the owners would go to the cops.

16:16.094 --> 16:17.260
Harper was lying.

16:17.262 --> 16:18.962
Yeah, looks like it.

16:18.964 --> 16:20.964
And to his own family, too.

16:20.966 --> 16:22.432
So, the question is,

16:22.434 --> 16:24.334
what was he really stealing
that money for?

16:24.336 --> 16:28.338
I don't know, but whatever
it was, it cost him his life.

16:45.383 --> 16:47.317
Look, Daddy. Motorcycles!

16:47.319 --> 16:49.285
Oh, yeah,
there's a bunch of 'em.

16:49.287 --> 16:51.921
Whoa! Cool!

16:51.923 --> 16:53.289
That's awesome!

16:53.291 --> 16:55.191
Let's follow
them, Daddy.

16:55.193 --> 16:57.394
Absolutely not!

18:06.598 --> 18:09.566
That was quite

18:09.568 --> 18:13.570
a show, gentlemen, and now,
to show our appreciation,

18:13.572 --> 18:18.108
these fine officers will now
kindly escort you to jail.

18:23.714 --> 18:25.849
Ahe Makino?

18:27.451 --> 18:29.419
You just posted.

18:31.356 --> 18:33.089
All right, boys.

18:33.091 --> 18:34.791
See you on
the outside.

18:34.793 --> 18:36.860
All right, all
right, all right.

18:49.473 --> 18:51.508
You said I made bail!

18:51.510 --> 18:53.977
Oh, he lied.

18:53.979 --> 18:56.713
Let's go.

19:00.718 --> 19:02.652
All right, listen up, Ahe,

19:02.654 --> 19:04.721
'cause we're about
to do you a solid.

19:04.723 --> 19:06.790
Right now your boys
think you made bail.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.793
Yeah, as far as they know,
you're back on the street,

19:09.795 --> 19:12.796
not in here telling us
everything you know

19:12.798 --> 19:14.764
about those trucks
that were hit.

19:14.766 --> 19:17.133
Why would I know anything
about that?

19:17.135 --> 19:19.068
You know we're cops, right?

19:19.070 --> 19:21.604
So we know that
you already have a record

19:21.606 --> 19:23.540
for possession and sale
of stolen property.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.542
And there's
this other thing.

19:25.544 --> 19:27.301
While you were being processed,
HPD searched your place

19:27.302 --> 19:29.224
and found all sorts of
merchandise from the hijackings.

19:29.225 --> 19:30.011
All right, look.

19:30.015 --> 19:31.247
Here's the deal, right?
What are you,

19:31.249 --> 19:32.482
about a buck, 50, dripping wet?

19:32.484 --> 19:33.950
Okay, you don't match
the description

19:33.952 --> 19:36.586
of any of the hijackers, okay?
This is good news for you.

19:36.588 --> 19:38.388
Plus, we're guessing
that you don't have the balls

19:38.390 --> 19:40.156
to stick your neck out
on the line like that,

19:40.158 --> 19:41.724
which makes you
just their fence.

19:41.726 --> 19:43.827
All right,
so what's gonna happen is,

19:43.829 --> 19:48.698
you're gonna give us a name
right now, and you can go home.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.366
Okay.

19:50.368 --> 19:52.502
The guy you're looking for
is Iceman.

19:52.504 --> 19:54.771
Iceman?
Like from <i>Top Gun?</i>

19:54.773 --> 19:56.339
What's <i>Top Gun?</i>

19:58.142 --> 19:59.776
Did he say, "What's <i>Top Gun?"</i>

19:59.778 --> 20:00.743
I should arrest him

20:00.745 --> 20:01.644
just for that.

20:01.646 --> 20:03.279
Where do we find Iceman?

20:03.281 --> 20:04.714
I couldn't tell you.

20:04.716 --> 20:06.182
I don't even know his real name.

20:06.184 --> 20:07.984
That's convenient.
This ain't the Shriners Club.

20:07.986 --> 20:09.619
Okay, we don't have
business cards.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.754
You know what the Shriners Club
is, you never seen <i>Top Gun?</i>

20:11.756 --> 20:15.325
How do you get
in contact with Iceman?

20:15.327 --> 20:16.826
I don't.

20:16.828 --> 20:20.230
He comes to me when
he has stuff to move.

20:20.232 --> 20:23.566
Last we spoke, he said he was
coming into some laptops soon.

20:23.568 --> 20:24.701
How soon?

20:24.703 --> 20:27.470
Tonight, apparently.

20:27.472 --> 20:32.375
Told me to expect them
first thing tomorrow morning.

20:32.377 --> 20:34.744
All right, so if this
guy is telling the truth,

20:34.746 --> 20:37.146
there should be a shipment of
laptops getting boosted tonight.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.249
Right, well, Chin's pulling up
cargo manifests right now.

20:39.251 --> 20:41.718
If we can find out which truck
the crew is going hit,

20:41.720 --> 20:44.354
then maybe we can catch
these guys in the act, right?

20:44.356 --> 20:45.255
All right,
what's going on?

20:45.257 --> 20:46.890
From what we've put together,

20:46.892 --> 20:48.992
Harper made nearly
$800,000 disappear

20:48.994 --> 20:51.394
from the company
over the last three years.

20:51.396 --> 20:53.029
Guy got pretty good at
covering his tracks, too.

20:53.031 --> 20:54.864
I mean, he tried every
conceivable trick in the book.

20:54.866 --> 20:58.134
The Harpers seem to be living
well within their means, though.

20:58.136 --> 20:59.435
No fancy cars,

20:59.437 --> 21:00.703
lavish vacations.

21:00.705 --> 21:02.171
So where did all
the money go?

21:02.173 --> 21:03.306
I'm not sure,
but at least

21:03.308 --> 21:05.608
some of it was going
to this guy-- John Messer.

21:05.610 --> 21:06.709
According to the books,

21:06.711 --> 21:08.578
Harper was paying
him 150k a year

21:08.580 --> 21:09.946
to consult on the business.

21:09.948 --> 21:12.548
Thing is, nobody

21:12.550 --> 21:14.617
in the entire company
had ever heard of this guy.

21:14.619 --> 21:17.186
Yeah, the checks were being sent
to an address on Maui,

21:17.188 --> 21:19.956
where it just so happens, a
Kevin Harper was making regular

21:19.958 --> 21:21.090
monthly visits.

21:21.092 --> 21:22.392
Even though
the company

21:22.394 --> 21:23.860
doesn't have any
business interests there.

21:23.862 --> 21:25.094
Okay, and there's

21:25.096 --> 21:26.729
no driver's license

21:26.731 --> 21:27.797
or photo ID
for this guy

21:27.799 --> 21:28.965
on file.

21:28.967 --> 21:30.233
No, just some bank info.

21:30.235 --> 21:32.368
All right, so I'm gonna
take a wild guess

21:32.370 --> 21:34.570
and say that this Messer
does not exist.

21:34.572 --> 21:36.572
All right, you, uh, you come up
with a fake name, you put it

21:36.574 --> 21:37.974
on the payroll, and then,
you cash the checks yourself.

21:37.976 --> 21:40.743
That would explain why he was
traveling to Maui so frequently.

21:40.745 --> 21:43.079
Yeah, we thought
the same thing.

21:43.081 --> 21:46.249
But Messer has
a legitimate address on Maui.

21:46.251 --> 21:48.985
And state records show him to be
married with a couple of kids.

21:48.987 --> 21:51.754
Yeah, he may have
a low profile,

21:51.756 --> 21:52.989
but he's definitely real.

21:52.991 --> 21:54.190
All right, fine.

21:54.192 --> 21:57.093
But let's talk
about the $150,000 a year.

21:57.095 --> 21:59.329
Nobody does that out
of the kindness of their heart.

21:59.331 --> 22:01.297
Right? So, whatever
Harper was into,

22:01.299 --> 22:03.032
this guy Messer's involved.

22:03.034 --> 22:04.667
All right, we need to find out
who he is

22:04.669 --> 22:06.269
and how he connects
to everything.

22:06.271 --> 22:07.403
All right?
Yeah. We're on it.

22:07.405 --> 22:09.806
Just got a hit on the cargo.

22:09.808 --> 22:11.708
Shipment of laptops
just landed at port.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.209
Trucks are being
loaded as we speak.

22:13.211 --> 22:14.310
That's us. Let's go.

22:14.312 --> 22:16.713
♪ ♪

22:52.916 --> 22:54.584
Get out!

22:56.587 --> 22:57.954
Get out of the cab now!

23:03.293 --> 23:05.428
Surprise.

23:05.430 --> 23:06.696
Lay down on the ground.

23:06.698 --> 23:08.164
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

23:08.166 --> 23:11.200
Down on the ground right now!
Keep your hands

23:11.202 --> 23:12.802
where we can see them!
Get on the ground!

23:28.197 --> 23:30.799
So you're the Iceman, huh?

23:33.236 --> 23:35.103
You had a good run.

23:35.105 --> 23:37.639
Nine hijackings
over the last three months.

23:37.641 --> 23:40.742
Over a million dollars
in merchandise stolen.

23:40.744 --> 23:42.344
It was a good run.

23:42.346 --> 23:44.346
So why don't you
tell me something.

23:44.348 --> 23:45.680
Why would you push your luck
and try your hand

23:45.682 --> 23:46.948
at murder-for hire?

23:46.950 --> 23:49.017
That could be anybody.

23:49.019 --> 23:51.353
That bike is customized

23:51.355 --> 23:55.023
exactly the same way as the
bikes you and your crew ride.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.558
Coincidence.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.462
It's the same gun
that you and your crew use.

24:00.464 --> 24:03.165
Look, I didn't shoot anyone.

24:03.167 --> 24:05.767
Not yourself, no,

24:05.769 --> 24:07.135
I believe that,
but here's the thing.

24:07.137 --> 24:08.503
This is my problem, all right.

24:08.505 --> 24:09.704
You got a five man team.

24:09.706 --> 24:11.907
When you hit that truck,
you hit it with four guys.

24:14.811 --> 24:17.312
Okay, so I'm thinking
the missing guy is my guy.

24:17.314 --> 24:18.314
He's the shooter.

24:20.116 --> 24:22.083
All right, he pulls the hit off,
you give him the night off.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.518
Tell him to lay low
for a while.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.987
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

24:25.989 --> 24:27.189
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

24:27.191 --> 24:28.690
I'm talking about
you going to prison

24:28.692 --> 24:30.992
for 20 years to life.

24:30.994 --> 24:32.794
As an accessory to murder,
all right.

24:32.796 --> 24:34.229
And that's on top
of the hijackings.

24:34.231 --> 24:36.164
That's what
I'm talking about.

24:36.999 --> 24:39.367
Wait, hold up.

24:40.269 --> 24:43.738
Suppose I told you
that guy acted alone?

24:45.208 --> 24:48.310
That he was going to hit
the truck with us last night,

24:48.312 --> 24:50.846
but that he called
a few hours before

24:50.848 --> 24:54.182
to say he couldn't make it.

24:56.652 --> 24:58.286
If you want me to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

24:58.288 --> 25:00.589
I'm gonna need a name.

25:03.259 --> 25:05.527
Meet Tyler Kaheaku.

25:05.529 --> 25:07.062
21 years old,

25:07.064 --> 25:09.664
multiple arrests for armed
robbery and assault.

25:09.666 --> 25:13.268
HPD paid him a visit at the
hardware store where he works,

25:13.270 --> 25:15.070
but he didn't show
up this morning.

25:15.072 --> 25:16.872
Well, that's 'cause you get a
day off after you kill somebody.

25:16.874 --> 25:19.708
So his crew said
Kaheaku was present

25:19.710 --> 25:21.409
at all of the hijackings

25:21.411 --> 25:24.079
until last night
when he bailed unexpectedly.

25:24.081 --> 25:25.313
Never give a reason why.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.048
All right, let's say
they're telling the truth.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.516
Is it possible
that this was not a hire

25:28.518 --> 25:30.385
and that it was
something personal?

25:30.387 --> 25:32.187
I don't know. We need to dig
into this kid's life,

25:32.189 --> 25:33.989
see if there's any connection
to Harper.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.323
All right.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.292
So we've got a-a...
an embezzling restaurateur

25:37.294 --> 25:38.593
and a juvenile delinquent.

25:38.595 --> 25:40.395
Aside from the fact
that they are both criminals,

25:40.397 --> 25:41.830
what do these two
have in common?

25:41.832 --> 25:43.164
I got something.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.800
That was very fast.
Yeah.

25:45.802 --> 25:48.503
This is Tyler's
Facebook page.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.105
Recognize the girl
in the photos?

25:52.909 --> 25:54.376
That's Harper's daughter.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.755
Mrs. Harper,

26:06.757 --> 26:09.157
is, uh, is
Aubrey around?

26:09.159 --> 26:10.358
We need to speak
with her.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.327
No, I'm sorry,
she's not here.

26:12.329 --> 26:13.495
Where is she?

26:14.363 --> 26:16.264
I haven't seen her
since this morning.

26:16.266 --> 26:17.599
Can I ask what this is about?

26:17.601 --> 26:19.000
Yeah, I'm gonna show
you a photograph.

26:19.002 --> 26:20.368
Uh, do me a favor.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.836
Tell me, ever seen
this guy before?

26:22.772 --> 26:25.807
No, I've never seen him.
Who is he?

26:25.809 --> 26:27.842
Okay, his name is Tyler Kaheaku,

26:27.844 --> 26:30.412
and he is a suspect
in your husband's murder.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.080
You're telling me
that my daughter

26:32.082 --> 26:33.715
might know the man
who did this?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.250
Pretty well.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.020
These are, uh,

26:39.022 --> 26:42.190
these are photographs
from Aubrey's Facebook page.

26:42.192 --> 26:43.458
And by the looks of things,

26:43.460 --> 26:45.500
they've been seeing each other
for about six months.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.464
Oh, my God.

26:49.466 --> 26:51.566
What is it?

26:54.603 --> 26:56.538
It's just that, uh...

26:56.540 --> 27:00.041
Aubrey and Kevin had been
fighting a lot recently.

27:00.043 --> 27:02.410
I assumed it was just the stress
that everybody was under

27:02.412 --> 27:03.878
because of the court case
and everything.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.282
Maybe it was because he found
out about the relationship.

27:07.284 --> 27:09.250
It's possible.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.187
He was always so protective
over Aubrey.

27:12.189 --> 27:14.723
He probably didn't want
to upset me.

27:14.725 --> 27:16.257
Listen, Mrs. Harper, if
Aubrey is still hanging out

27:16.259 --> 27:17.759
with this guy,
she could be in great danger.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.127
We need to find her right away.

27:30.673 --> 27:32.707
Hey, Mom.

27:32.709 --> 27:34.209
Hey. I'm just checking in.

27:34.211 --> 27:35.844
Where are you?

27:35.846 --> 27:38.279
Just out.

27:39.148 --> 27:40.548
What's up?

27:43.420 --> 27:45.787
I hadn't heard from you
in awhile.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.156
Any idea when you might
be coming home?

27:48.158 --> 27:51.459
I'm not coming home, Mom.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.395
What do you mean?

27:53.397 --> 27:55.430
I have to go away for a while.

27:55.432 --> 27:56.865
I-I can't explain right now.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.870
Look, Aubrey,
whatever's happening,

28:01.872 --> 28:04.139
we can get through this
together.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.974
Dad wasn't the man
you thought he was.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.409
I'm sorry, Mom.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.489
Call her back.
Keep trying.

28:22.525 --> 28:24.059
We need to go.

28:24.827 --> 28:26.094
Hi, this is Aubrey.

28:26.096 --> 28:28.696
Leave a message.

28:28.698 --> 28:30.331
All right, Chin,
where are we on the trace?

28:30.333 --> 28:32.500
I pinged her cell phone
to a gas station in Waipio

28:32.502 --> 28:33.868
but the signal just died.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.503
She must have dumped it.

28:37.940 --> 28:40.241
They're going on the run.

28:44.346 --> 28:46.781
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

28:46.783 --> 28:48.383
A 17-year-old girl
gets her boyfriend

28:48.385 --> 28:50.718
to kill her own father? Why?

28:50.720 --> 28:52.187
Why would she do that?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.322
You're asking me to get in the
head of a 17-year-old girl?

28:54.324 --> 28:55.757
Yes. Help me with this.

28:55.759 --> 28:58.660
Okay. Uh, maybe her father
found out about the relationship

28:58.662 --> 29:00.895
and told her she had to end it.
No.

29:00.897 --> 29:02.230
Are you kidding me?
She's not going to risk

29:02.232 --> 29:04.365
life imprisonment when
she's a couple of months away

29:04.367 --> 29:06.167
from becoming
a consenting adult?

29:06.169 --> 29:08.002
It doesn't make any sense.
I didn't want to answer the question.

29:08.004 --> 29:10.205
Listen. Just listen to me for a minute.
Let's break this down.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.706
Aubrey told her mother

29:11.708 --> 29:14.509
that her father is not
who he seemed to be.

29:14.511 --> 29:15.643
Correct?
Mm-hmm.

29:15.645 --> 29:18.079
Okay. I'm thinking she
found out that he lied

29:18.081 --> 29:20.315
about the Samoans extorting
money from the business.

29:20.317 --> 29:21.783
That's even dumber
than what I said.

29:21.785 --> 29:23.051
So, you kill your father?

29:23.053 --> 29:24.018
No, you just turn him in.

29:24.020 --> 29:25.386
Right, right. But what
if there's more?

29:25.388 --> 29:26.621
What if there's more to it?

29:26.623 --> 29:27.922
More to it how? What?

29:27.924 --> 29:30.558
Okay, well, the father lied
about the protection money.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.360
What else did he lie about?

29:32.362 --> 29:35.163
You keep asking me questions
I don't know the answers to.

29:35.165 --> 29:36.664
Then you get upset when I don't...
No, it's rhetorical.

29:36.666 --> 29:38.166
This is how we
figure things out.

29:38.168 --> 29:39.801
Well, if it's rhetorical, then
I don't really need to speak.

what he's been doing

30:53.343 --> 30:54.576
on all his trips to Maui.

30:54.578 --> 30:57.278
So Messer and Harper
are the same guy.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.480
Leading a double life.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.649
So sorry about that.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.952
And now, what can
I help you guys with?

31:17.148 --> 31:20.450
Okay, that was definitely
unexpected.

31:20.452 --> 31:22.585
Looked into Harper's
travel records.

31:22.587 --> 31:24.354
This has been going on
for four years.

31:24.356 --> 31:26.489
He'd spend a week or two
with his family on Maui

31:26.491 --> 31:28.825
and then say he had business out of town.

31:28.827 --> 31:30.460
Now, according to this wife,

31:30.462 --> 31:33.029
the guy had consulting gigs
all over the country,

31:33.031 --> 31:34.430
so it would be
perfectly normal

31:34.432 --> 31:36.166
for him to be gone
for long stretches of time.

31:36.168 --> 31:37.500
That's pretty impressive.

31:37.502 --> 31:38.801
I mean, I couldn't even keep
one marriage together.

31:38.803 --> 31:39.936
This guy was juggling two.

31:39.938 --> 31:42.572
Hey, takes a special kind
of sociopath

31:42.574 --> 31:44.240

that stuff separate, man.

31:44.242 --> 31:45.675
I mean, you say
the wrong name

31:45.677 --> 31:47.243
at the wrong time,
it's a wrap.

31:47.245 --> 31:48.745
All right, so he's dipping
into the business

31:48.747 --> 31:49.913
to support two families.

31:49.915 --> 31:51.347
Once the legal
problems started,

31:51.349 --> 31:53.316
Aubrey must've realized
what was going on.

31:53.318 --> 31:55.552
Yeah, you're a
17-year-old girl,

31:55.554 --> 31:57.053
think you're the center
of your father's universe,

31:57.055 --> 31:58.688
and then you find out
something like that.

31:58.690 --> 32:00.190
Must've left her shattered.

32:00.192 --> 32:02.158
So she gets her boyfriend

32:02.160 --> 32:03.593
to kill her father
at the deposition.

32:03.595 --> 32:05.862
Makes it look like
it was part of the lawsuit.

32:05.864 --> 32:07.664
Smart move.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.132
I mean,
this way you got the cops

32:09.134 --> 32:10.533
looking into the guy's
business dealings

32:10.535 --> 32:12.502
instead of his personal life.

32:12.504 --> 32:13.903
Right, and Aubrey gets

are on the run.

32:22.847 --> 32:24.247
They probably figure it's
just a matter of time

32:24.249 --> 32:25.348
before the cops
are on to them.

32:25.350 --> 32:26.749

32:26.751 --> 32:28.051

these kids are going to do

32:30.522 --> 32:32.455

they're cornered.

32:33.657 --> 32:35.291

Relax. Just relax.

<i>What the hell are you doing?!</i>

34:49.360 --> 34:50.659
If we die, they get away.

34:50.661 --> 34:52.128
You understand that concept?
Hold on.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.263
<i>Hey!</i>

35:02.740 --> 35:03.740
Hey!

35:04.274 --> 35:06.442

35:06.444 --> 35:07.276
<i>I hate the way you drive.</i>

35:07.278 --> 35:08.177
I hate the way
you look

35:08.179 --> 35:09.112
when you drive.
I hate everything

35:09.114 --> 35:10.246
<i>about your driving.</i>

35:18.455 --> 35:21.724
Let me explain to you but that's
a motorcycle. This is a car.

35:21.726 --> 35:22.892
They can't go the same places.

35:22.894 --> 35:26.195
<i>Says who?</i>

35:28.932 --> 35:30.199

what did I just say...
Would you relax? Just relax,

35:31.703 --> 35:32.402
all right? I got this.

35:48.419 --> 35:50.720
<i>What's he doing?</i>

35:50.722 --> 35:51.821
What's he doing?

35:54.258 --> 35:55.057
Whoa, whoa!

36:37.534 --> 36:39.335
Aubrey. Aubrey.

36:39.337 --> 36:41.370
Look at me.
Look at me.

36:41.372 --> 36:43.039
Can you hear
my voice?

36:43.041 --> 36:45.041
Can you hear
what I'm saying to you?

36:45.043 --> 36:47.443
Tyler. Wh...

36:47.445 --> 36:49.345
Where-Where's
Tyler?

36:56.554 --> 36:59.355
No!

36:59.357 --> 37:01.357
No!

37:17.474 --> 37:20.443
So what's gonna happen
to her now?

37:20.445 --> 37:24.780
Well, she's 17yeah, so she's
gonna be tried as a minor.

37:24.782 --> 37:27.783
Um, given the
circumstances,

37:27.785 --> 37:30.052
everything you've
been through,

37:30.054 --> 37:31.854
her emotional state,

37:31.856 --> 37:36.959
the judge might be lenient
when it comes to sentencing.

37:40.531 --> 37:44.066
I've already lost everything.

37:44.068 --> 37:46.102
I can't lose my daughter, too.

37:55.379 --> 37:57.580
Did she know?

37:59.683 --> 38:01.784
No, she didn't know.

38:01.786 --> 38:03.953
She was a victim,
like you.

38:06.857 --> 38:10.493
Kevin just had this way
about him.

38:11.595 --> 38:15.064
Whenever you were with him,
you just...

38:15.066 --> 38:19.502
just felt like the only person
in the world.

♪ ♪

39:01.278 --> 39:03.079
You're not
stretching?

39:03.081 --> 39:06.115
No. I don't, uh...
I don't believe in it.

39:06.117 --> 39:08.150
You don't believe
that stretching before exercise

39:08.152 --> 39:10.019
decreases the risk of injury?

39:10.021 --> 39:12.455
Well, I used to believe that,
until I slipped a disc

39:12.457 --> 39:14.123
while stretching one
of my hamstrings.

39:14.125 --> 39:17.193
Actually, the jury's
still out on stretching.

39:17.195 --> 39:18.661
Experts disagree whether it
should be performed

39:18.663 --> 39:19.895
before or after
the exercise.

39:19.897 --> 39:22.264
See? Listen to the team doctor.
He knows.

39:22.266 --> 39:24.500
- Mahalo.
- Hey, is Adam coming?

39:24.502 --> 39:26.702
Uh, no. He's still doing PT,

39:26.704 --> 39:28.304
um, getting back on his feet.

39:28.306 --> 39:30.039
You know,
figured it would be cruel

39:30.041 --> 39:31.574
to show him
how ambulatory I am.

39:35.012 --> 39:37.480
Anything else?

39:38.982 --> 39:41.217
And with Gabriel Waincroft
still out there,

39:41.219 --> 39:43.352
I think it'd be safer
for him to keep a low profile.

39:44.321 --> 39:46.689
Can't say I disagree with you
about that.

39:47.591 --> 39:50.259
You should know
something though, Kono.

39:50.261 --> 39:53.229
We're gonna find Gabriel.
I promise you.

39:55.198 --> 39:56.832
All right!
Look what

39:56.834 --> 39:58.467
we have here,
genuine Olympians.

39:58.469 --> 40:00.236
All right.
Hey,

40:00.238 --> 40:01.237
thanks for coming, guys.

40:01.239 --> 40:02.972
Anything for a
good cause, brah.

40:02.974 --> 40:05.875
We just came to wish you guys
Pomaika'i and show our support.

40:05.877 --> 40:09.145
10% of every purchase
at the shrimp truck today

40:09.147 --> 40:11.614
is gonna go
to those widows and orphans.

40:11.616 --> 40:14.650
All right. Let me guess, that
applies only to purchases made

40:14.652 --> 40:15.885
between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.

40:15.887 --> 40:17.687
Nah, brah, all day.

40:17.689 --> 40:19.755
I just asked that

40:19.757 --> 40:22.258
you guys consider wearing
these T-shirts I got made up.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.896
Got them sized out perfect.
So, what do you think?

40:24.897 --> 40:25.752
No.

40:25.830 --> 40:28.764
It's cotton. I can't....
It absorbs water, slows me down.

40:28.766 --> 40:30.700
You know?

40:30.702 --> 40:32.334
No, I-I would.
I just don't want to.

40:32.336 --> 40:34.904
You guys
didn't think this through.

40:34.906 --> 40:36.706
In about ten mines, we're
gonna be covered in schmutz

40:36.708 --> 40:38.207
from our asses to our eyebrows.

40:38.209 --> 40:39.542
Besides, you don't want
everyone to see

40:39.544 --> 40:42.244
that beautiful mug of yours
all covered in mud.

40:42.246 --> 40:43.460
Right?

40:43.484 --> 40:45.282
I'll have them waiting
at the finish line for you guys.

40:45.283 --> 40:47.583
Something clean to change in
after your victory.

40:47.585 --> 40:48.918

40:48.920 --> 40:50.186
All right, Five-O,

40:50.188 --> 40:52.321
huddle up-- we only got
about five more minutes.

40:52.323 --> 40:54.323
You'll probably talk
for four of them, won't you?

40:54.325 --> 40:56.992
You know what?
I bet you think that right now

40:56.994 --> 40:59.261
I'm gonna give
some grandiose speech, right?

40:59.263 --> 41:00.329
Yeah.

41:00.331 --> 41:02.164
Well, you would be correct.

41:02.166 --> 41:05.768
Let me tell y'all folks,
I'm not gonna lie to you,

41:05.770 --> 41:07.536
this thing is gonna be hard.

41:07.538 --> 41:09.505
Matter of fact, it's
gonna be damn near impossible.

41:09.507 --> 41:12.808
But if there's anybody
that can beat this thing here,

41:12.810 --> 41:14.143
it's you guys.

41:14.145 --> 41:15.678
'Cause I look around me

41:15.680 --> 41:18.447

understand the concept of team,

41:22.720 --> 41:26.322
people who know what it means

41:26.324 --> 41:28.324
bring out the best

41:28.326 --> 41:32.528
Damn, Lou, that arthritis didn't
slow your mouth down a beat.

41:32.530 --> 41:33.896
All right, all right,
I talk to much.

41:33.898 --> 41:35.531
All right, come on,
