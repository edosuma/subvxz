WEBVTT

00:00.095 --> 00:01.905
My name is Stephen Jameson.

00:02.106 --> 00:03.272
I'm one of the Tomorrow People.

00:03.474 --> 00:05.574
They call our powers the three T's.

00:05.736 --> 00:07.136
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

00:07.138 --> 00:08.337
Telekinesis...

00:08.339 --> 00:09.604
And teleportation.

00:09.606 --> 00:12.607
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:12.609 --> 00:15.026
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.098
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:18.099 --> 00:19.444
is to find my father.

00:19.616 --> 00:22.983
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:24.953 --> 00:26.887
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

00:26.939 --> 00:29.474
- I don't know what to tell you.
- How about the truth?

00:29.476 --> 00:30.575
That I'm a killer?

00:30.727 --> 00:32.259
I don't care what your secret was.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.761
It's that you kept it from me.

00:35.063 --> 00:37.131
You're the best person I've ever met.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.266
I think about you, Cara.

00:39.268 --> 00:41.034
I think about you too.

00:49.811 --> 00:53.246
I'll get them to the subway,
then I'll walk you to your car.

00:53.248 --> 00:55.081
My car's a block over.

00:55.083 --> 00:58.718
You don't want to be out alone
with this lunatic still loose.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.753
Okay.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.604 --> 01:54.906
I don't want to hurt you. Please
don't run. If you run, I get upset.

01:56.042 --> 01:57.242
Don't come any closer!

02:00.612 --> 02:02.613
There now, you see what you did?

02:02.615 --> 02:03.715
Now I'm upset.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.790
Morning.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.093
Cara?

02:17.128 --> 02:18.262
Hello?

02:27.072 --> 02:28.272
Can I come in?

02:31.142 --> 02:32.876
Hey.

02:32.878 --> 02:36.145
Why didn't you answer me? I was
getting all telepathically romantic.

02:36.147 --> 02:39.683
I was in the shower. Running
water can be a psychic barrier.

02:39.685 --> 02:41.251
Didn't know that.

02:44.355 --> 02:47.290
So, how 'bout we order some room
service and watch a bad movie?

02:48.859 --> 02:51.660
There's a couple from
Arizona about to check in.

02:51.662 --> 02:52.896
You should get dressed.

02:54.164 --> 02:55.631
Okay.

02:56.666 --> 02:58.768
So last night was pretty...

03:00.771 --> 03:02.138
awesome, right?

03:03.607 --> 03:05.608
But, you know, just to
make sure it wasn't a fluke,

03:05.610 --> 03:07.710
we should probably do
it another dozen times.

03:10.013 --> 03:12.615
I don't know if it's that simple.

03:12.617 --> 03:13.816
For me anyway.

03:15.619 --> 03:18.788
Okay, yeah. So what now?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.760
I'm not sure.

03:28.331 --> 03:30.265
Quick. They're here...

03:31.935 --> 03:35.170
Hi, I was just checking out.

03:46.014 --> 03:47.148
Hey.

03:48.918 --> 03:50.718
I missed you.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.086
Got you this.

03:53.121 --> 03:54.989
Oregon state animal.

03:54.991 --> 03:56.846
I know the last few weeks have been tough,

03:56.847 --> 03:58.392
so I wanted to start over.

03:58.727 --> 04:01.895
This little guy is a peace offering.

04:01.897 --> 04:02.863
He's a beaver.

04:04.132 --> 04:06.067
It's cute. Thanks.

04:06.069 --> 04:10.537
So it turns out our resident klepto
is actually a mad musical genius.

04:10.539 --> 04:12.840
Like a violin prodigy or something?

04:12.842 --> 04:15.141
Oh, 'cause I'm Asian
I must play the violin.

04:16.209 --> 04:17.911
Piano?

04:17.913 --> 04:19.279
Real good at math too.

04:21.783 --> 04:25.619
- So, where have you been?
- Nowhere.

04:25.621 --> 04:28.955
You got in pretty late last
night. I saw your bed was empty.

04:28.957 --> 04:33.726
Yeah, I, um, I spent the night
at a hotel. I needed some me time.

04:33.728 --> 04:35.795
There's something in here you ought to see.

04:38.065 --> 04:40.000
Wait. Slow down. Back up.

04:40.002 --> 04:41.834
You're saying you've been
tracking a breakout on your own?

04:41.836 --> 04:44.236
I had to. There was no one else here.

04:44.238 --> 04:46.005
I didn't get any signals.

04:46.007 --> 04:47.974
That's probably because
he broke out years ago,

04:47.976 --> 04:49.909
so his psychic footprint's not spiking.

04:49.911 --> 04:52.044
Truth is, this guy has
reason not to be found.

04:52.046 --> 04:54.113
So who's the target, Tim?

04:54.115 --> 04:57.550
The suspect in question strikes between
ten at night and two in the morning.

04:57.552 --> 05:00.552
- All around this eight block radius.
- What do you mean, "strikes?"

05:00.554 --> 05:02.473
Here's the police composite sketch.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.304
Along with the sexual assault reports.

05:04.691 --> 05:06.525
We're looking for a rapist?

05:06.527 --> 05:09.861
No, that doesn't make any sense.
Are you sure he's one of us?

05:09.863 --> 05:12.864
The way he vanishes into
thin air, he's gotta be.

05:12.866 --> 05:14.533
So much for homo-superior.

05:14.535 --> 05:16.168
Our powers don't make us good.

05:16.170 --> 05:19.938
They just make us powerful.
How we use them is up to us.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.841
This guy is twisted. With or without 'em.

05:22.843 --> 05:25.810
What doesn't make sense is how
Ultra still hasn't tracked him down.

05:25.812 --> 05:28.947
So we catch him, and then what? I
mean, it's not like we have a prison.

05:28.949 --> 05:32.617
Personally, I'd like to castrate him,
but that might not be that practical.

05:32.619 --> 05:34.885
It's disgusting.

05:34.887 --> 05:38.156
Not the castration part, I
think that's entirely justified.

05:38.158 --> 05:41.592
I just mean that one of our kind,
a supposedly more evolved species

05:41.594 --> 05:44.495
would use their powers for... that.

05:44.497 --> 05:46.145
I couldn't agree more.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.495
So why not let Ultra do what they do best?

05:48.499 --> 05:49.797
We're better than them.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.846
We're faster, and it could mean
one less woman gets attacked.

05:53.072 --> 05:55.906
In that case we should get
a hold of Ultra's intel.

05:55.908 --> 05:57.875
See what else they have
on this sick bastard.

05:59.177 --> 06:02.179
- As in contact Stephen.
- Me?

06:02.181 --> 06:04.748
Yeah. You are all in his head.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.684
I'd rather focus on trying
to get a read on this guy.

06:10.188 --> 06:12.956
- I'll contact him.
- Thanks, Irene. I got it.

06:31.609 --> 06:33.776
I thought you'd be used to this by now.

06:35.779 --> 06:36.980
Getting agents killed.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.083
What'd you just say?

06:41.085 --> 06:43.919
Can't wait for the day when
it's your crap being boxed up.

06:43.921 --> 06:46.188
You son of a bitch. She was my partner.

06:46.190 --> 06:48.657
And look how well that worked out for her.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.126
You're too young. You're too green.

06:50.128 --> 06:53.262
And your partners end up too dead.

06:53.264 --> 06:55.631
You're way out of your depth, man.
I don't care who you're related to.

06:55.633 --> 06:58.166
- Yeah? Why don't you do something about it?
- All right, gentlemen. Enough.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.469
I think we can find a better
outlet for our grief than this, yes?

07:03.039 --> 07:05.206
Look, I know we all miss Agent Nichols,

07:05.208 --> 07:07.301
but the best way to honor her memory

07:07.302 --> 07:09.182
is to continue doing what we're doing.

07:09.189 --> 07:11.322
Which is what, exactly?

07:11.324 --> 07:14.259
It just so happens we have a very dangerous

07:14.261 --> 07:16.994
criminal breakout on the streets right now.

07:16.996 --> 07:19.697
He's wanted in a string
of assaults clustered here.

07:19.699 --> 07:21.832
He seems to be following
a geographic pattern.

07:21.834 --> 07:24.769
Now, all the victims say the
assailant moved like lightning.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.771
One second they're in the
street, the next second

07:26.773 --> 07:30.340
they're in a dark concrete room where
he violates them, and then like magic,

07:30.342 --> 07:32.877
they wake up in their
bedrooms with their hair wet.

07:34.896 --> 07:38.232
So, needless to say, if the local
PD gets this lunatic before we do,

07:38.234 --> 07:41.735
- it could compromise our entire organization.
- That's the priority?

07:41.737 --> 07:43.904
Not stopping more women from being raped?

07:43.906 --> 07:45.806
Should you be watching your tone, son?

07:45.808 --> 07:47.341
Maybe I should get some air.

07:49.243 --> 07:52.779
Hey. I didn't say "meeting dismissed."

07:52.781 --> 07:56.015
Perkins is right, okay? I'm
toxic. First Vaughn, then Darcy.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.284
Look what happens to the people around me.

07:58.286 --> 08:03.223
Those guys don't want me
here, okay? I'm a liability.

08:03.225 --> 08:07.660
Well, perhaps a few days away from
headquarters would do you some good.

08:07.662 --> 08:09.436
But, remember, Stephen,

08:09.437 --> 08:11.280
you've seen what we do
to rogue agents here.

08:11.294 --> 08:12.860
You'd be no different.

08:12.862 --> 08:15.596
So get it together fast.
You're wearing on morale.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.076
Didn't mean to scare you.

08:29.078 --> 08:31.078
- You didn't.
- We need your help.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.347
Ultra's tracking a breakout who
actually deserves to get caught.

08:34.349 --> 08:36.316
We just gotta make sure they bring him in.

08:36.318 --> 08:38.150
Sorry. Taking a little time off.

08:38.153 --> 08:39.751
Says who?

08:39.754 --> 08:40.999
My boss slash uncle.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.715
He thinks the stress of
the job is getting to me.

08:43.325 --> 08:46.659
- What do you think?
- I think that Jedikiah only knows about half

08:46.661 --> 08:49.129
my life, the Ultra half,
which is bad enough, but then

08:49.131 --> 08:52.498
there's the whole "survival our species
depends on you" thing with you guys.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.602
Stephen. I get it. It's a lot of pressure.

08:55.604 --> 08:59.438
And our world can be a little intense.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.409
But it's up to you. You
can't choose your destiny.

09:03.411 --> 09:06.245
You can only fulfill it or fail it.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.482
You hearing me, Stephen?

09:11.485 --> 09:13.018
Yeah, I hear you.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.390
All right. I am starving.

09:21.536 --> 09:28.430
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

09:39.030 --> 09:41.765
Wow. Haven't seen you look this glum

09:41.767 --> 09:44.001
since your volcano didn't erupt
in sixth grade Earth Science.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.971
I know you can hear me.

09:51.275 --> 09:53.043
So, what happened?

09:53.045 --> 09:55.311
Well, I used corn starch instead
of baking soda, so the volcano...

09:55.313 --> 09:57.414
I'm serious.

09:57.416 --> 09:59.718
I have these powers,

09:59.719 --> 10:02.262
okay, which, theoretically,
should make my life awesome,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.854
but some reason, everything
I touch I seem to destroy.

10:04.856 --> 10:06.422
Well, maybe you're not
using them to full effect.

10:08.491 --> 10:11.928
If I could make stuff fly, I
would have some fun with it.

10:11.930 --> 10:15.130
I can read minds, okay?
Now, that should be cool.

10:15.132 --> 10:18.133
But who wants to know that Jamie
Wright cheated on his Bio quiz and

10:18.135 --> 10:20.369
thinks he might have crabs?

10:22.505 --> 10:23.462
Okay.

10:23.463 --> 10:25.802
Yeah, I can see how that
could get burdensome.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.943
Yeah.

10:27.945 --> 10:32.847
Just to be clear, my mind
is totally off limits. Right?

10:32.849 --> 10:35.817
Yes, okay? I would never.
It'd be like seeing you naked.

10:35.819 --> 10:39.854
- It'd just be wrong.
- Oh, what's wrong with me naked?

10:39.856 --> 10:40.662
Jameson!

10:42.063 --> 10:44.403
I so hate to interrupt
your little tea time.

10:44.427 --> 10:46.928
But how'd you like to come down
here and head up the B-team?

10:46.930 --> 10:49.330
- Sure, coming right down, coach.
- I'll be here.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.201
Well, here's your chance.

10:53.203 --> 10:55.598
With great power, comes
great responsibility.

10:55.599 --> 10:56.959
To have yourself some fun.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.240
Can't wait. Picking you first.

11:03.979 --> 11:07.482
- David.
- Move it, dumpling.

11:07.484 --> 11:08.483
Astrid.

11:10.351 --> 11:11.351
Van.

11:13.154 --> 11:16.490
- Rory.
- I forgot my inhaler...

11:16.492 --> 11:19.126
Let's go, Rory. That's five on five.

11:19.128 --> 11:20.494
All right. Let's do battle.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.329
Okay, bring it in, bring it in.

11:22.331 --> 11:25.232
Now, have any of you guys
seen the Bad News Bears?

11:25.234 --> 11:27.934
Yeah. They lose in the end.

11:27.936 --> 11:31.371
Thank you, Rory. But you
know what else they did?

11:31.373 --> 11:34.474
They showed the other team what
they were made of, okay? Their grit.

11:34.476 --> 11:37.544
Now, let's get out there and
kick some ass! Come on, Ror!

11:37.546 --> 11:39.379
Center court, let's go kids.

11:41.815 --> 11:43.215
Rousing speech, dickhead.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.168
You got it, Rory! Put it up!

12:15.915 --> 12:17.049
Suck it, Juergens!

12:21.487 --> 12:23.021
Told you this could be awesome.

12:23.023 --> 12:25.023
Yeah, maybe I've just been
using these powers the wrong way.

12:25.025 --> 12:26.424
And now you're showing off.

12:26.426 --> 12:28.560
Did you just slap my ass?

12:28.562 --> 12:32.163
Got a little carried away.
Let's never speak of it.

12:32.165 --> 12:34.762
Jameson! That was nice.

12:34.763 --> 12:37.400
Here's the deal, Jimmy
Brandt sprained his ankle,

12:37.404 --> 12:41.105
and Risdall's got the flu, so
Varsity squad is a body short.

12:41.107 --> 12:42.558
You come work out with us,

12:42.559 --> 12:44.070
we'll suit you up for the
game this weekend, okay?

12:44.077 --> 12:45.376
No, thanks. I appreciate it...

12:45.378 --> 12:48.212
Hey, we can't mount a
squad, we forfeit the game.

12:49.882 --> 12:51.348
Let's play ball!

12:51.350 --> 12:53.984
Now what? We're totally screwed.

12:53.986 --> 12:58.255
All these trees, there's zero visibility,

12:58.257 --> 13:01.525
Tim got nothing on surveillance.
This pervert knows what he's doing.

13:01.527 --> 13:05.295
Meanwhile, we're out in the open waiting
to get caught up in an Ultra sweep.

13:05.297 --> 13:07.163
You wanna leave, John? Leave.

13:07.165 --> 13:10.867
Well, wherever this guy's taking
his victims it must be close.

13:10.869 --> 13:12.231
We should split up.

13:12.232 --> 13:14.742
So I don't have to listen
to you two bicker anymore.

13:16.073 --> 13:17.441
What? We're not splitting up?

13:17.443 --> 13:19.008
You tell me, Cara.

13:20.077 --> 13:22.178
Is that a joke?

13:22.180 --> 13:23.495
You haven't forgiven me.

13:23.496 --> 13:26.567
For not telling you the truth
about being able to kill.

13:28.953 --> 13:32.355
While I was away with
Russell, I thought about you.

13:32.357 --> 13:34.023
Us. A lot.

13:35.159 --> 13:37.993
I realized how much I let us down.

13:40.096 --> 13:42.931
I know I have to earn your trust back,

13:42.933 --> 13:44.900
but there's nothing we
can't get through, right?

13:47.070 --> 13:49.838
I know I'm not the "I
love you" kind of guy,

13:51.808 --> 13:53.008
But, yeah, I do.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.245
Now you tell me?

13:56.247 --> 13:57.980
Come on, no one's perfect.

14:06.522 --> 14:08.456
This is so trippy.

14:08.458 --> 14:11.859
- Is your whole body tingling?
- Yes, all of it.

14:11.861 --> 14:13.961
Look at your hair.

14:13.963 --> 14:16.398
- Is it good?
- It's good now.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.260
Well, you did just

14:18.261 --> 14:21.477
atomize me to the top of the
Empire State Building and back.

14:21.805 --> 14:23.271
I told you this could be fun.

14:26.275 --> 14:28.109
So, where we going next?

14:28.111 --> 14:30.178
We can go wherever you...

14:30.180 --> 14:32.847
Um, sorry. I didn't...

14:32.849 --> 14:34.849
Hi.

14:34.851 --> 14:36.350
I'm Astrid.

14:36.352 --> 14:37.351
Cara.

14:38.821 --> 14:40.487
I've heard a lot about you.

14:40.489 --> 14:41.727
Yeah?

14:43.001 --> 14:45.673
Um, Astrid, do you mind giving us a minute?

14:45.678 --> 14:48.311
Of course. I should be
getting home anyway, so...

14:49.346 --> 14:51.347
It was nice to meet you, Cara.

14:58.156 --> 15:00.190
I wasn't expecting you.

15:00.192 --> 15:03.359
Stephen, we need you back inside Ultra.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.828
Unless we know where they
are with tracking this guy

15:05.830 --> 15:07.497
there's no telling when he'll attack next.

15:07.499 --> 15:09.632
So, you're just here on official
Tomorrow People business?

15:11.068 --> 15:13.736
What happened between us,

15:13.738 --> 15:15.638
should never have happened.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.841
It was a mistake. It was my fault,
and I take full responsibility.

15:18.843 --> 15:21.143
So, I'm a mistake now?

15:21.145 --> 15:23.012
No.

15:23.014 --> 15:27.482
The other night. Us. That was
a mistake. It was my mistake.

15:27.484 --> 15:31.620
How did we get to "mistake"
from "I'm not sure"?

15:31.622 --> 15:33.689
It's not like we just hooked up.

15:33.691 --> 15:37.158
Okay? There has been something
between us from the very beginning.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.462
Before I even saw your face when
you were just a voice inside my head.

15:40.464 --> 15:41.499
- Stop.
- No.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.541
Look me in the eye

15:43.542 --> 15:45.294
and tell me you don't feel it.

15:46.836 --> 15:49.705
Let me inside your mind so I know
you're not covering up the truth.

15:49.707 --> 15:53.842
And if you can do that,
in all honesty, then

15:55.277 --> 15:56.677
I'll never bring it up again.

15:59.314 --> 16:00.581
I'm sorry, Stephen.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.386
I don't get it Jameson.

16:14.687 --> 16:15.898
When did you stop sucking?

16:16.828 --> 16:19.063
- It's a recent development.
- Oh, hell, no.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.298
My dad's moved their book
club to my house tonight.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.134
Gonna have to cancel the pep
party. What's our back-up plan?

16:24.136 --> 16:26.003
What's a pep party?

16:26.005 --> 16:27.705
Just a little get together for the team.

16:27.707 --> 16:29.272
Get us focused on the big
game. Kind of a tradition.

16:31.843 --> 16:33.776
You were so invited.

16:33.778 --> 16:36.313
Well, my mom's working the night
shift. Maybe we could do it at my place?

17:04.207 --> 17:06.275
Whoa. Trippy.

17:10.747 --> 17:12.515
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

17:12.517 --> 17:14.782
- Yeah, thanks for the invite.
- Sorry, it was just supposed to be a few guys.

17:15.984 --> 17:17.786
Not according to Twitter.

17:17.788 --> 17:21.056
I am so screwed. Will you just make
sure no one pukes on the couch please?

17:22.992 --> 17:24.559
Yo, don't forget the host.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.929
Oh, no thanks, I'm not drinking
with the big game in the morning.

17:27.931 --> 17:30.899
Neither are we. Just keepin' up
appearances. Man, it's apple juice.

17:30.901 --> 17:32.134
Okay.

17:32.136 --> 17:33.268
I mean tequila.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.906
Oh, man, my bad. Here, wash
it down with more tequila!

17:37.908 --> 17:40.308
Can't even taste the third one. I promise.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.178
Did you know that someone's turning
our bathtub into a gravity bong?

17:43.180 --> 17:46.047
What? How do you know what
a... It doesn't matter.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.982
If you breathe a word of this to mom...

17:47.984 --> 17:50.418
Oh, please. You're finally a baller.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.988
- Why would I ruin it?
- Hey mini-dude, you beer pong?

17:53.990 --> 17:57.257
- No. Off-limits.
- I'm Luca.

17:57.259 --> 17:58.258
Hi, Luca.

17:59.861 --> 18:03.097
I'm Juergens. This is Van.
This is David-with-two-dads.

18:03.099 --> 18:04.631
I know who you guys are.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.966
Hi, Stephen.

18:05.968 --> 18:08.268
Uh, Jenny, hi.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.495
There's an emergency situation upstairs

18:10.496 --> 18:11.989
that you might wanna check out.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.743
Like, stat.

18:13.775 --> 18:14.974
Yeah. Thank you.

18:14.975 --> 18:16.629
Excuse me. Sorry.

18:21.015 --> 18:22.982
So, what's the emergency?

18:22.984 --> 18:25.852
That I might never get up
the nerve to do this again.

18:27.822 --> 18:30.890
This spot is the central
intersection of the four attacks.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.592
Focus your energy there.

18:32.594 --> 18:35.762
If he strikes again, you should
be able to get a fast read on him.

18:35.764 --> 18:39.599
Aw, I can't wait to get my
hands on this creep. Bam! Pow!

18:39.601 --> 18:43.870
Karate chop castration,
right to the cojones.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.037
It's a patented technique.

18:45.039 --> 18:47.273
Irene's tapped into the police scanners.

18:47.275 --> 18:48.807
Why don't you go help her?

18:50.076 --> 18:52.712
Third wheel, preparing for take-off.

18:56.883 --> 18:58.817
I told you we'll find him and we will.

19:01.821 --> 19:02.855
What?

19:06.092 --> 19:09.694
You know how we said we would
tell each other everything?

19:09.696 --> 19:11.646
That we could get past anything

19:11.647 --> 19:13.247
as long as we were honest with each other?

19:13.834 --> 19:14.867
Yeah.

19:17.036 --> 19:20.805
While you were gone, I made a mistake.

19:20.807 --> 19:23.875
Cara, there's nothing you could of done.

19:24.943 --> 19:26.311
I slept with Stephen.

19:30.583 --> 19:31.983
I'm so sorry.

19:35.888 --> 19:37.889
If I could take it back, I would.

19:37.891 --> 19:39.855
And it doesn't change how I feel about you.

19:39.856 --> 19:42.104
The thought of losing you terrifies me.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.098
Say something.

19:50.602 --> 19:51.902
Are we even now?

19:53.137 --> 19:57.675
I lied to you, you lied
to me, is that how it is?

19:57.677 --> 19:59.677
No. No, that's not...

19:59.679 --> 20:02.313
It took me years to tell you the
truth about the Annex Project.

20:02.315 --> 20:05.749
It took you two days to
come clean about this.

20:07.151 --> 20:08.919
So, in that respect, you win.

20:13.257 --> 20:14.791
Now what?

20:14.793 --> 20:16.159
I guess that's up to you.

20:23.201 --> 20:24.600
Stephen?

20:26.670 --> 20:30.039
Uh, the cops are just
about to bust your party.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.808
I, uh, I thought you should know.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.943
Damn it. Excuse me, Jenny.

20:38.181 --> 20:39.615
Call me.

20:43.019 --> 20:45.921
- What?
- Nothing.

20:45.923 --> 20:49.925
- Okay, go ahead. Judge.
- Like you need me.

20:49.927 --> 20:53.262
Jenny Riordin? Seriously?
How wasted was she?

20:53.264 --> 20:55.898
- Okay, she kissed me.
- Oh, right.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.867
Now was this before or after she
forced you to do tequila shots?

20:58.869 --> 21:00.335
No, that was Juergens.

21:00.337 --> 21:02.170
You're not gonna take
responsibility for any of this?

21:02.172 --> 21:04.773
You're the one who told me to
have more fun with my powers.

21:04.775 --> 21:07.342
To have more fun. Not to be a jerk.

21:07.344 --> 21:10.311
You know, you're turning into
the people we roll our eyes at.

21:10.313 --> 21:12.347
You kind of suck at being a superhero.

21:12.349 --> 21:15.049
Yeah. I know. That's what I've
been trying to tell everyone.

21:15.051 --> 21:16.217
Who's everyone?

21:19.021 --> 21:22.823
- You mean your new friend, Cara?
- Okay, what is your issue?

21:22.825 --> 21:24.725
I'm in love with you.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.698
Stephen, did you just...

21:30.700 --> 21:32.633
No. No. Astrid, I...

21:32.635 --> 21:33.601
You're an ass.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.937
It was an accident, okay? I swear.

21:36.939 --> 21:37.548
Okay.

21:37.549 --> 21:39.857
Let's not make this any more
awkward than it already is.

22:01.628 --> 22:03.629
I just felt...

22:03.631 --> 22:05.297
Someone teleported.

22:12.338 --> 22:14.005
If you're calm, I won't kill you.

22:14.007 --> 22:16.742
Shh. It's okay.

22:22.014 --> 22:24.215
- Let her go.
- No.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.883
You should go.

22:25.885 --> 22:28.153
I'm sorry. Maybe you didn't
hear me, you rapist piece of...

22:35.928 --> 22:37.590
Why didn't you tell me you were like me?

22:37.591 --> 22:39.482
One of the blessed ones.

22:41.032 --> 22:42.166
Oh, a little crime-fighting crew?

22:44.202 --> 22:46.203
You get a read on him? Where'd he go?

22:47.606 --> 22:50.240
- I don't know.
- He couldn't have gone far.

22:50.242 --> 22:52.176
Must have left some kind of signature.

22:53.979 --> 22:55.846
- Is she okay?
- Hey.

22:55.848 --> 22:58.215
Can you hear me? You're safe now.

23:19.804 --> 23:22.572
Looks like somebody's been a very bad boy.

23:24.408 --> 23:29.345
Using your powers to win
basketball games and throw parties.

23:29.347 --> 23:30.763
Just because you're on leave,

23:30.764 --> 23:32.864
doesn't mean we're not
keeping tabs on you, kid.

23:37.787 --> 23:40.890
- Hold out your wrist.
- Why? So you can slap it?

23:40.892 --> 23:41.891
Get off me!

23:45.094 --> 23:46.762
What the hell is this?

23:46.764 --> 23:48.459
That is a suppression cuff.

23:49.145 --> 23:51.575
Another one of your dad's nifty inventions.

23:52.869 --> 23:55.170
You're so sick of your powers,

23:55.172 --> 23:57.606
well, now you're gonna feel
what it's like not to have them.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.010
Okay, I know I screwed
up. But I need my powers.

24:03.146 --> 24:04.979
Cuff must be working.

24:04.981 --> 24:07.682
If you could read my
mind, you would have moved.

24:30.605 --> 24:32.739
Sweet bracelet.

24:32.741 --> 24:36.410
Yeah, it's one of those,
uh, balance band things.

24:36.412 --> 24:41.214
Great. By the way, mom
left you a little present.

24:41.216 --> 24:43.784
I thought she was sleeping at
the hospital between shifts?

24:43.786 --> 24:46.386
Yeah, no, she came home for breakfast.

24:46.388 --> 24:49.856
You know when she does
that quiet angry thing

24:49.858 --> 24:52.355
- and you wish she'd just yell?
- Yeah?

24:52.356 --> 24:54.391
- Yeah, she did that.
- Great.

24:55.930 --> 24:57.964
- Anyway.
- Get out.

25:19.386 --> 25:23.789
Yeah, the cuff doesn't come off
till your uncle wants it to come off.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.991
The material is a titanium blend,

25:25.993 --> 25:28.761
essentially unbreakable,
impervious to powers.

25:28.763 --> 25:31.629
If we knew the alloy, we
could circumvent it. We don't.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.832
You wanted a simpler life. You got it.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.201
And you guys know everything, huh?

25:36.203 --> 25:39.271
When you're a man down, chasing
a psychotic serial rapist,

25:39.273 --> 25:40.739
you gotta do your homework.

25:40.741 --> 25:44.009
Look, I get it. Hey, I
needed a break. I'm good now.

25:44.011 --> 25:45.210
I'm ready to help.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.044
Without your powers, you're useless.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.250
What? We're all thinking it.

25:52.252 --> 25:53.685
I wasn't thinking it.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.355
What are the badges for?

25:57.357 --> 26:00.157
The guy we're chasing had
one on his shirtsleeve.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.359
I couldn't get a read on it.

26:01.361 --> 26:04.328
He's extremely fast, and
we are extremely busy.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.632
Don't you have a game to get to?

26:08.634 --> 26:11.769
Sorry we can't help you with the cuff.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.804
Make peace with Jedikiah and it'll go away.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.708
Until then, lay low.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.876
Lay low?

26:18.878 --> 26:21.645
On a basketball court in
front of my whole school?

26:21.647 --> 26:23.213
Awesome.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.748
I'll take you topside.

26:29.287 --> 26:32.289
- Thanks for doing this.
- No problem.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.992
I got your back for the big
game. Just like you got mine.

26:46.804 --> 26:48.939
Go Wildcats!

27:01.618 --> 27:04.119
Time, Ref! Come on. Let's go. Hurry up!

27:06.222 --> 27:09.358
Guys. All right, questions.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.950
Why are we dragging ass on D, huh?

27:11.951 --> 27:14.793
And Jameson? Donde esta the magic?

27:17.834 --> 27:21.337
- Yeah, just warming up, okay?
- It's killing us, Jameson.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.138
We've worked on this.
Heads in the game. Let's go.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.774
- On three, Wildcats. One, two, three!
- Wildcats!

27:25.776 --> 27:27.041
Let's go boys. Let's go.

27:30.613 --> 27:31.680
Go Wildcats.

27:50.732 --> 27:52.332
Sweet, bro. Next stop NBA.

28:25.566 --> 28:27.033
What the hell was that about?

28:28.235 --> 28:30.169
Oh, just having a little fun.

28:31.672 --> 28:34.841
Like you did. While I was away.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.676
Look, It just happened. Okay?
It's not like I planned it.

28:37.678 --> 28:41.880
Whatever the hell happened between
you two, it didn't mean a thing.

28:41.882 --> 28:45.284
You had sex. That's all. Congratulations.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.689
I hope it made you feel like a big man.

28:54.894 --> 28:57.062
I'd be careful, Stephen.

28:57.064 --> 29:00.165
You saw what happened without
your powers. You're nothing.

29:00.167 --> 29:02.140
Yeah? And who are you?

29:02.141 --> 29:04.149
A rebel leader who doesn't fight?

29:04.337 --> 29:07.271
With the trail of bodies
you've left in your wake,

29:07.272 --> 29:08.272
above ground and below,

29:09.843 --> 29:12.544
pardon me for not taking
leadership advice from you.

29:38.336 --> 29:42.907
If either one of you says, "He started
it." I will tear you both to shreds.

29:46.777 --> 29:48.277
This is my fault.

29:49.048 --> 29:52.111
What happened between us
was a one-time mistake.

29:53.151 --> 29:54.318
I am with John.

29:56.588 --> 29:59.510
Fighting each other is
a path to extinction,

29:59.511 --> 30:01.129
which is why this ends now. Do you hear me?

30:20.810 --> 30:23.078
They wake up in their
bedrooms with their hair wet.

30:25.182 --> 30:27.716
I was in the shower. Running
water can be a psychic barrier.

30:29.085 --> 30:30.653
He takes them to the sewers.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.776
Please!

31:36.612 --> 31:37.812
Hey!

31:43.252 --> 31:44.686
We have a guest.

31:44.688 --> 31:46.488
Run.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.489
Run!

31:54.463 --> 31:55.830
An unfriendly guest.

31:57.232 --> 31:59.701
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with, friend.

31:59.703 --> 32:01.836
You think your powers make you special?

32:01.838 --> 32:02.770
Don't they?

32:08.810 --> 32:11.678
He got you pretty good. Are you okay?

32:15.917 --> 32:16.917
You're sick.

32:23.392 --> 32:24.558
And you're weak.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.532
That's gonna make it easier than I thought.

32:35.403 --> 32:36.403
Bad dog.

32:39.807 --> 32:40.806
Stephen.

32:42.876 --> 32:45.745
He found the breakout. He needs our help.

32:45.747 --> 32:48.448
Stephen has a suppression cuff on.

32:48.450 --> 32:50.816
- How's he communicating?
- I don't know. But he is.

32:54.288 --> 32:57.156
You can't kill me. I know you can't.

32:57.158 --> 32:59.859
Someone's gonna find you sooner
or later. You have to give up.

32:59.861 --> 33:04.163
I can do whatever I want. Whenever I want.

33:12.172 --> 33:13.555
Now, I may not be able to kill you.

33:14.008 --> 33:15.920
But let's see if this current can.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.084
It's too easy.

33:31.424 --> 33:32.858
- Stephen!
- I got him.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.554
I'm gonna make you beg.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.109
Not a hell hot enough, is there?

34:16.754 --> 34:17.855
Stay back.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.590
I don't want you here, Stephen.

34:22.126 --> 34:23.525
You need to go back.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.529
Dad?

34:28.699 --> 34:29.833
Son.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.003
Dad, I need your help. Please.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.206
Save yourself.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.808
Save all of them.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.141
How?

34:40.143 --> 34:42.978
Dad, tell me what to do. Please.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.847
Thanatos.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.716
Dad, I don't know what that means.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.551
Dad, come on, give me something. Please!

35:39.309 --> 35:40.276
Lucky guy.

35:49.386 --> 35:51.254
Good job.

35:51.256 --> 35:54.123
- Who figured out where he was hiding?
- I did.

35:56.427 --> 35:58.127
That's a story I'd like to hear.

36:01.598 --> 36:03.306
So you did this all on your own?

36:03.307 --> 36:05.998
You tracked down and
apprehended a violent breakout

36:06.003 --> 36:07.969
all without the benefit of your powers?

36:07.971 --> 36:09.815
What can I say? Powers are overrated.

36:09.816 --> 36:11.438
But I'd still like mine back.

36:11.975 --> 36:15.210
So, I can assume your little walk
through the wilderness is over?

36:15.212 --> 36:18.813
Yes. I'm ready to come back as
an agent as soon as possible, sir.

36:18.815 --> 36:21.816
Good, good. I'm curious, though.

36:21.818 --> 36:23.684
Why the change of heart?

36:23.686 --> 36:26.821
I thought you didn't have the
stomach for this kind of work.

36:26.823 --> 36:28.783
My destiny isn't something I choose.

36:28.784 --> 36:31.791
I can only choose to fulfill or fail it.

36:32.996 --> 36:36.597
You should know I would have removed
your powers permanently if I had to.

36:36.599 --> 36:38.933
Well, good thing you
don't have to. Do you mind?

36:48.976 --> 36:51.245
One more thing, Stephen.
The man you brought in

36:51.247 --> 36:54.848
was ranting about being attacked
by someone with paranormal powers.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.383
- Obviously not me.
- No.

36:57.385 --> 37:01.654
A woman. Dark hair, piercing blue eyes.

37:02.655 --> 37:03.506
Does that ring a bell?

37:03.825 --> 37:08.028
Like I said, I brought him in alone.

37:08.030 --> 37:09.930
I wonder where he came up with that story.

37:09.932 --> 37:12.666
Maybe it has something to do
with the fact that he's insane?

37:12.668 --> 37:14.833
Mmm.

37:14.835 --> 37:15.920
What happens to him now?

37:15.921 --> 37:18.827
Oh, something you definitely
don't have the stomach for.

37:28.582 --> 37:29.682
John!

37:31.885 --> 37:33.085
So, are we good?

37:34.738 --> 37:38.273
Well, technically, now we've
both made out with Stephen.

37:38.275 --> 37:40.142
So, I'm willing to call it even.

37:42.779 --> 37:43.851
He's in love with you.

37:45.339 --> 37:46.524
You know that, right?

37:48.050 --> 37:49.951
Yeah.

37:49.953 --> 37:53.021
Don't you think that's kind of a problem?

37:53.023 --> 37:54.438
We all have to work together.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.923
Without Stephen, there is no endgame.

37:59.662 --> 38:00.662
John.

38:03.298 --> 38:04.766
He's not imagining it.

38:06.135 --> 38:08.970
Whatever it is between Stephen and me,

38:08.972 --> 38:10.972
there is something.

38:10.974 --> 38:12.874
I'll lie to him.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.073
I will tell him it doesn't exist

38:14.074 --> 38:16.520
if that's what it takes to
keep the harmony down here.

38:17.113 --> 38:18.245
To survive.

38:21.183 --> 38:22.583
I can't lie to you.

38:25.587 --> 38:27.087
Do you love me, Cara?

38:28.590 --> 38:29.590
Yes.

38:40.334 --> 38:41.935
That's all I need to know.

38:52.979 --> 38:55.147
Thank you.

38:55.149 --> 38:57.750
- Peace offering?
- I'm not in the mood.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.053
Little known fact. Pork buns were
served at the Geneva Convention.

39:01.055 --> 39:04.023
These little guys are the unsung
heroes of all great peace treaties.

39:04.025 --> 39:06.192
- You mind if I sit?
- If I said no, would it stop you?

39:06.194 --> 39:09.795
Definitely not.

39:09.797 --> 39:13.626
I'm fine. Look, I let my
powers go to my head a little.

39:13.627 --> 39:14.627
You think?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.277
Okay, a lot.

39:16.478 --> 39:19.431
Becoming a jerk wasn't part of my plan.

39:19.432 --> 39:20.432
I'm sorry.

39:20.908 --> 39:23.175
Thank you for reminding me
who I was before I had them.

39:23.177 --> 39:25.711
Yeah, it was like the
plot of an '80s movie.

39:25.713 --> 39:28.880
You went from geek to
chic then back to geek.

39:28.882 --> 39:30.739
You got the popular girl and here you are,

39:30.740 --> 39:32.262
begging for your best friend back.

39:32.786 --> 39:34.986
Except you ruined the ending, 'cause

39:34.988 --> 39:37.222
you already know how she
really feels about you.

39:37.224 --> 39:39.725
I love you too, Astrid.

39:39.727 --> 39:44.095
Oh, barf, here comes the
"like a friend" qualifier.

39:44.097 --> 39:47.098
No, it's not just that,
okay? There's someone else.

39:48.968 --> 39:52.670
- Yeah, the girl in your room. Cara.
- Yeah.

39:52.672 --> 39:55.907
If it makes you feel any
better, she doesn't love me back.

39:55.909 --> 39:57.041
Is that what she told you?

39:59.177 --> 40:01.912
You don't have to be a
mind-reader to know she's lying.

40:13.958 --> 40:14.815
Do me a favor.

40:14.816 --> 40:16.895
The next time you want to go after
a psychotic breakout on your own

40:16.896 --> 40:19.263
without your powers, don't.

40:19.265 --> 40:20.864
Sure thing.

40:20.866 --> 40:22.199
But I wasn't on my own.

40:22.201 --> 40:24.668
You're lucky I even
knew you were in trouble.

40:24.670 --> 40:27.070
That cuff should have blocked
me from hearing your voice.

40:27.072 --> 40:28.638
That's what I've been saying all along.

40:29.808 --> 40:30.808
We're connected.

40:32.710 --> 40:36.112
Look, you can fight it, deny it
all you want, Cara. But you and I,

40:37.181 --> 40:38.247
we're inevitable.

40:40.418 --> 40:42.185
That's the last time
I'll bring it up, okay?

40:45.189 --> 40:46.956
Okay.

40:46.958 --> 40:48.724
Bad timing, I'm guessing.

40:50.894 --> 40:55.230
No. I actually came here
to talk to both of you.

40:55.232 --> 40:57.933
It's about my dad. He's alive. I saw him.

41:00.169 --> 41:02.137
And we're gonna figure out how to find him.
