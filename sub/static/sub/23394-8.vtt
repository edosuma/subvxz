WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.083
Scalped.

00:03.212 --> 00:06.376
I saw something similar when
I was ranching in the Dakotas.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.375
Look for any mention of patients
with a connection to the West.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.677
"Dirtier than a red Injun."

00:12.804 --> 00:14.449
It's in the letter he wrote
to Mrs. Santorelli.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.393
He's witnessed these things,
probably as a child.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.475
Here's another one.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.953
Of the patients who match
our description

00:18.977 --> 00:20.788
that have spent time in
the West, these four were sent

00:20.812 --> 00:22.452
to St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in Washington.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.560
I think he may have been
a soldier.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.853
- Have you told Kreizler?
- You'll have to tell him.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.317
Come on, then.
We'll go together.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.445
No.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.026
Has something happened
between you?

00:34.159 --> 00:35.695
You're in well over your head.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.194
You don't scare me, Connor.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.240
I'd very much like
if you would join me for dinner.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.996
I wonder what's gotten into her.

01:38.390 --> 01:42.634
I'm curious how you propose to
gain access to Bunzl's records.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.479
Laszlo.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.974
Yes, John.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.647
Your attention certainly seems
to be drawn elsewhere

01:51.778 --> 01:52.778
this morning.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.653
If you're referring to the fact
I've not asked

01:54.781 --> 01:56.067
about what happened
to your face,

01:56.199 --> 01:58.612
it's only because I wanted to
spare you the embarrassment.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.367
What if I told you I'd met
an old friend for a drink?

02:03.498 --> 02:06.457
That resulted in two black eyes?

02:07.836 --> 02:10.453
Sometimes, Laszlo, there are
words spoken between people

02:10.589 --> 02:12.125
that are to be left private.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.841
What about Julia Pratt?

02:16.887 --> 02:18.173
Julia Pratt?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.921
Your former fiancÃ©e.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.844
She lives in Washington,
doesn't she?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.682
Will you not take the time
to see her?

02:23.810 --> 02:26.393
Why should I take the time
to see Julia Pratt?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.478
Because you were in love
with her.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.437
I rarely think about that time
in my life.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.149
I've decided it's much better
to look to the future

02:36.281 --> 02:37.738
than dwell in the past.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.198
I'm hungry.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.696
Let's eat.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.407
There's a French alienist
named Broca I came across

02:47.542 --> 02:49.329
when I researched
Mary's aphasia.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.189
He believes there's a certain
section of the brain

02:51.213 --> 02:53.921
responsible for speech,
another for empathy,

02:54.049 --> 02:55.256
even one for love.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.750
Love resides in the heart.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.467
Nonsense.
The heart is simply a muscle.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.507
Love isn't a mystery
any more than cholera.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.846
Cholera is a disease.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.202
The point is each part
of the brain has a function,

03:04.226 --> 03:07.060
and that function is developed
or impaired...

03:43.306 --> 03:45.118
They may as well
blame me personally

03:45.142 --> 03:46.599
for these murders.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.287
I'll soon find myself
tar and feathered,

03:48.395 --> 03:50.887
and it won't be metaphorically,
either.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.397
Dr. Kreizler's on his way
to Washington,

03:53.525 --> 03:54.982
if it's some consolation.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.568
Your Indians proved
illuminating, sir.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.256
He believes there may be
some connection

03:59.322 --> 04:01.689
between our killer and the West.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.236
Go on.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.245
I believe I should have gone
to Washington myself.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.535
But that's not why you're upset.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.454
I'm not entirely insensitive

04:12.586 --> 04:15.169
to the hidden currents
between people.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.172
Dr. Kreizler may need
your assistance

04:18.300 --> 04:21.543
to gain entry into certain
federal institutions.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.044
I have a friend there.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.921
He knows everyone in town.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.552
- Hooker's Division.
- How's that?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.144
I was referring to
the neighborhood.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.559
During the war,
General Hooker and his men

04:34.691 --> 04:37.104
used to frequently enjoy
the hospitality on offer here

04:37.235 --> 04:38.316
in their off-duty hours.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.732
Uh, your finest whiskey,
darling.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.356
And bring yourself back here
as soon as possible.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.528
Nothing.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.321
Make it two.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.456
You mind if I ask you
what the other fella looks like?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.915
I'm sorry.
The other fella?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.372
Commissioner Roosevelt
said you work

04:59.508 --> 05:00.651
at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.675
Commissioner.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.009
Theodore sure has a way
of falling up.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.805
- Falling up?
- Yes.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.222
Well, there are some men
who have a way about them

05:08.350 --> 05:10.683
that even when they fail,
they succeed.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.349
My friend Moore here
is hoping to examine records

05:13.480 --> 05:15.517
of unsolved massacres
that took place out West.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.187
Unsolved? Not many of them,
I can tell you.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.462
We'd like to have a look anyway.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.978
Would you care to dance, mister?

05:22.614 --> 05:25.357
I-I'm afraid I have
two left feet.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.903
I would only embarrass myself.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.494
- You look like the kind of...
- Thank you, but... no, thank you.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.035
You got a taker here, sweet pea.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.662
Come by my office
in the morning.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.123
Do you, uh, come here often?

05:53.019 --> 05:55.227
You're Dr. Kreizler.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.644
I heard a rumor
you were on the premises.

05:58.775 --> 06:03.395
I saw you speak at Johns Hopkins
some years ago.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.238
Dr. Ignatius Blunt.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.941
It truly is an honor.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.866
Uh, may I ask the...
the purpose of your visit?

06:13.415 --> 06:16.249
I'm looking for someone
who was once a patient here.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.412
His name?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.955
Rudolf Bunzl.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.579
Yes.
Uh, he was a soldier.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.549
Uh, served in the Army
of the West, if I recall.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.668
Uh, tall, early 30s.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.171
I believe he suffers from
some sort of facial deformity,

06:30.307 --> 06:33.425
something congenital
or acquired in his youth.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.846
Mm, no.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.721
In that case,
I'm not sure he's your man.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.516
There was someone else
released years ago.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.062
I don't recall his name.

06:43.194 --> 06:47.108
He had a most, um...
horrific tic.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.740
A tic?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.235
Yes, an intermittent
and violent contraction

06:52.370 --> 06:53.861
of the ocular
and facial muscles.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.204
What happened to him?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.449
Iggy?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.997
What have I told you
about bothering our visitors?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.212
I was just speaking with
Dr. Kreizler about a patient.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.208
You know we never discuss
patients.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.925
But he's a doctor.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.391
Iggy.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.938
It was a honor to meet you,
Dr. Kreizler.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.942
Army surgeon.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.737
Hacked off a few too many limbs
at Gettysburg.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.279
Never quite the same.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.200
I'm afraid I have some bad news,
Dr. Kreizler.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.291
The patient you were
inquiring after is dead.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.501
Our records indicate
that Rudolf Bunzl died

07:42.629 --> 07:45.212
and was buried at Arlington...
let's see...

07:45.340 --> 07:46.706
four months ago.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.128
I'm, uh, sorry
to disappoint you.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.098
Dr. Dillman, was there a
patient here some time back

07:56.226 --> 07:58.684
who suffered from a facial tic,
one with intermittent

07:58.812 --> 08:01.145
and violent contractions
around the eyes?

08:01.272 --> 08:04.185
Doesn't ring a bell,
but then I'm fairly new here.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.984
Do you mind if I have a look
at the records?

08:07.821 --> 08:11.189
Dr. Kreizler, I was instructed
to offer you assistance.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.924
I believe I've done
what was asked of me.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.694
I'll be searching within a very
narrow range of indicators.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.116
We have over 10,000 records
stored here.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.080
I have all afternoon.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.038
The type of mutilation

08:24.170 --> 08:26.082
tells you which tribe
is responsible.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.214
These were...

08:27.298 --> 08:29.790
Well, it's hard to tell
from a photograph.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.715
What's that in his mouth?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.965
That, my good man,
is what every fella thinks with.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.717
And I'm not talking about
his brains.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.219
We were the same.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.438
Took our fair share of peckers
and ears along the way.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.728
Boys will be boys.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.560
Chops?

08:49.696 --> 08:50.696
Shh.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.482
- Chops?
- Lunch.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.737
There's a splendid place
on the Hill that serves them.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.657
Good beer, too.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.825
I think I'll poke through
the rest of these.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.869
Just leave them on the table
when you're done.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.921
Teething.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.341
I'm sure that's what it is.
She's at that age.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.430
Well, is there anything
I can do?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.558
Clove oil.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.051
Dab a bit on your finger and
rub it into your baby's gums.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.053
It acts as a mild analgesic.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.189
How much?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.147
Don't worry.
It's only a bit of clove oil.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.267
I want to pay for it,
Mr. Freewater.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.773
I can take care
of my daughter alone.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.905
Here.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.916
I can tell by the expression
on your face

09:50.048 --> 09:52.290
you were as successful as I was.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.792
- How successful were you?
- I found nothing.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.752
Every unsolved massacre

09:56.888 --> 09:59.596
was inevitably attributed
to marauding Indians.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.056
They seem to have become
a symbol

10:01.184 --> 10:03.141
for all forms of savagery.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.635
What did you find?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.639
The man we came to inquire after
is dead.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.561
- Dead?
- As a hobnail.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.184
Upon further investigation,
I found another soldier,

10:12.320 --> 10:14.061
one who fit our circumstances,

10:14.197 --> 10:16.780
but had never served
further west than Chicago.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.774
I found a murder that fit
our circumstances

10:18.910 --> 10:21.323
but took place
in upstate New York.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.537
The local constabulary
investigated

10:23.665 --> 10:25.247
and attributed it
to a marauding Indian

10:25.375 --> 10:28.334
supposedly seeking revenge
on a minister and his wife.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.875
Where?
What town?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.338
New Paltz.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.131
- What is it?
- Look at this.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.131
The other soldier
that drew my attention,

10:41.266 --> 10:43.053
Corporal John Beecham,

10:43.184 --> 10:46.723
suffered from a most noticeable
facial tic.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.767
Look at his place of birth.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.560
New Paltz.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.399
Coincidence?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.687
I need to see
the official records, of course.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.484
In the meantime,
ring Miss Howard.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.322
Let her know what we've found.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.284
Me?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.993
Why don't you tell me what
happened between the two of you?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.908
She's to use her authority
to find out more

11:05.039 --> 11:07.122
about this massacre
from local officials.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.217
Miss Howard? Telephone.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.715
- Police headquarters.
- Yes, sir.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.467
This is Miss Howard.

11:26.603 --> 11:30.222
Sara, listen to me.
We've found something.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.807
There was a massacre
in New Paltz.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.151
It's possible it was committed
by a man named Beecham.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.565
John Beecham.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.657
Go on.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.775
Sixteen years ago,
a minister and his wife,

11:42.911 --> 11:45.824
savagely murdered,
supposedly by Indians.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.662
They had a son that survived,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.622
and he lives not far
from Boston.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.164
Kreizler and I intend
to go speak with him.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.252
His name's Adam Dury.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.916
- Shall I meet you?
- No, no.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.587
Kreizler feels you'll be
more useful where you are.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.051
He'd like you to contact
the authorities in New Paltz

12:01.179 --> 12:05.264
and see if they have any more
information on the murders.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.848
But I can't just stay here.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.218
Why isn't he calling me himself?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.686
What?

12:10.813 --> 12:12.099
Sara?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.348
I'm here.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.065
There's one more thing.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.684
You're to inform the Isaacsons

12:16.819 --> 12:18.401
they're to be
on the first train west

12:18.529 --> 12:21.738
to rendezvous with
John Beecham's former commander.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.357
I'll let them know.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.287
Sara?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.655
Yes?

12:30.959 --> 12:32.621
Be careful.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.773
Do you think we'll see
any buffalo in North Dakota?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.272
If they haven't all been killed.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.149
What about Indians?

13:05.868 --> 13:08.030
If they haven't all been killed.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.294
You know, why should I care
if that's Esther's baby?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.042
You don't believe me, do you?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.631
Believe what?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.294
That I don't have feelings
for Esther.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.181
I came into this world
two minutes before you did.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.016
I know you better than anyone.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.012
I know you better
than you know yourself.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.513
You're in love with Esther.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.532
Do you regret
not visiting Julia?

13:49.454 --> 13:50.661
We hardly had time.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.245
One makes time when one wants.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.490
Then there's your answer.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.540
I can't believe
we're bypassing New York

13:59.672 --> 14:02.881
and going straightaway
to God knows where.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.171
Newton, Massachusetts.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.881
May I ask...
Why are you so interested?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.466
Adam Dury lives there.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.685
I meant in my seeing Julia.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.812
I remember when you first met
Julia.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.523
Your company was rather dull

14:20.651 --> 14:22.893
because you could think of
nothing else.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.942
What does it feel like
when you're in the first throes?

14:34.082 --> 14:36.290
Restlessness, above all.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.952
Your mind is never still.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.799
You wait at a street corner
in case she happens to pass by.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.465
You attend a party
that you'd otherwise dread

14:49.597 --> 14:51.714
in hopes she's been invited.

14:56.396 --> 15:01.061
And you try to bring
every conversation back to love.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.938
Are you Miss Howard?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.070
Yes.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.187
I'm Eliza.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.154
Mrs. Kirkpatrick sent me
to fetch you.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.117
- From the boarding house?
- Yes, Miss.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.201
Let me take your bag.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.245
It'll be dark soon.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.893
Mrs. Kirkpatrick said
I should take you

15:58.958 --> 16:01.996
over to the old Dury place
in the morning.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.790
What do you sell?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.080
What do I sell?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.878
Most of the boarders we get
are salesmen.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.382
I work for the New York
Police Department.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.423
I never heard of a lady
working for the police,

16:16.559 --> 16:18.596
especially in New York City.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.685
I'm the first.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.404
Excuse me.
What are those mountains?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.067
You mean the Gunks.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.618
The Gunks?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.830
Shawangunks.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.119
Locals call them Gunks
for short.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.787
Do people climb them?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.707
Oh, yes.
I climb them myself.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.838
You?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.498
Why shouldn't I?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.474
Newton, Massachusetts.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.093
I believe
there's a factory there

17:01.229 --> 17:03.642
that makes a biscuit
my grandmother is very fond of.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.388
Your grandmother?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.438
Yes.
Made with figs.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.777
Ghastly sounding,
but she swears by them.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.237
I think it best
we stay the night

17:12.365 --> 17:14.152
and attempt to speak
to Mr. Dury tomorrow.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.525
And no mention of the Dury name
to anyone.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.489
You think
there might be trouble?

17:18.621 --> 17:22.204
Let's just say I'd rather
he wasn't expecting us.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.413
- It's not respecting the dead.
- What isn't?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.383
This.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.590
You're sightseeing,

17:31.717 --> 17:34.551
acting like a ghoulish tourist
visiting a grave site.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.426
People visit the pyramids.
They're grave sites.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.766
That's different.
This is Sitting Bull.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.227
Battle of Little Big Horn.
Custer's Last Stand.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.478
Are you the men waiting
to see Captain Miller?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.212
Yes. I'm Detective Sergeant
Marcus Isaacson.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.273
And this is my broth...

17:57.743 --> 18:02.955
âª Jesus loves
the little children âª

18:03.082 --> 18:07.326
âª All the children
of the world âª

18:07.461 --> 18:09.623
âª Red, yellow,
black, and white âª

18:09.755 --> 18:11.792
âª They are precious
in his sight âª

18:11.924 --> 18:15.668
You've come all this way to
inquire about Corporal Beecham?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.295
- You remember him?
- Remember him?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.595
It's been 10 years, and I
can't get him out of my head.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.601
His Army records state
that he was sent

18:24.729 --> 18:26.329
to the Government Hospital
for the Insane

18:26.439 --> 18:28.396
after being found unfit
for service.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.640
Mm.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.194
It says you were the officer
who relieved him of his duty.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.069
It was the regimental surgeon
who declared him unfit to serve,

18:38.200 --> 18:39.862
and sent him back east.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.823
Would you say
he was a good soldier?

18:42.955 --> 18:43.955
At first.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.623
He was disciplined,
attentive to detail, efficient.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.333
Didn't get on
with the other men,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.168
but I put that down
to him being religious

18:50.296 --> 18:53.505
and disapproving
of their whoring and drinking.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.925
I've seen men driven to
bloodlust out here in the West,

19:01.057 --> 19:02.673
never in a place like Chicago

19:02.808 --> 19:04.661
and certainly not in the course
of a labor riot.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.347
You're talking about
the Haymarket riots?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.479
That's right.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.221
We were called in
to keep the peace,

19:09.357 --> 19:11.189
but the violence got ugly.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.810
A bomb thrown amongst police,
rioters shot and killed.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.773
I mean, you must be half-crazy
to do what he did that day.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.738
What exactly did he do?

19:30.461 --> 19:35.081
I came across him sitting
astride a dead striker...

19:35.216 --> 19:40.382
young man,... boy, really...
in a back alley.

19:42.014 --> 19:46.475
He was stabbing at the body
with a knife over and over.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.012
That wasn't the worst of it.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.018
He was naked.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.107
Naked?

19:55.236 --> 19:58.570
From head to foot,
drenched in blood.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.325
Down there, between his legs...

20:05.246 --> 20:07.454
...he was stiff as a flagpole.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.135
Jesus! Does that child
ever stop bawling?!

20:22.263 --> 20:24.880
Well, it would help
if her father took her for once.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.927
That's enough from you, woman.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.426
Well, let her
suck on some candy.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.054
Thank you, Mr. Byrnes,
but she's got no teeth.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.227
Why don't you give it
to your namesake, then?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.601
Here you go, young Thomas.
You take it.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.813
Got a tongue in your head,
haven't you? What you say?

20:41.949 --> 20:44.236
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, young man.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.904
Now, go on.
Get.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.699
All of you.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.004
They was two days
snooping around Washington,

20:57.131 --> 21:00.044
in and out of various buildings
and such.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.963
Do you know
what they were looking for?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.256
Cowboys and Indians, it seems.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.513
Whoever does solve
these murders,

21:07.641 --> 21:09.633
one thing's for certain.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.555
It's not going to be...

21:11.687 --> 21:13.303
That alienist.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.474
I'm not going to let him throw
30 bloody years of police work

21:17.610 --> 21:19.226
out the window.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.102
Do you understand me?

21:23.699 --> 21:26.362
I'll let the Swede know
of your concerns.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.299
You knew them?

21:46.889 --> 21:48.471
The Dury family?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.559
I knew them.
The whole town knew them.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.348
The reverend and his wife.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.267
Adam, their oldest.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.043
My brother went to school
with their youngest.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.524
Japheth.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.646
He was the one kidnapped
by Indians.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.365
That's what the papers said
at the time.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.322
Whoa.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.286
Can't keep the sheriff waiting.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.836
House is this way...
what's left of it.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.846
You the gal from the city?

22:29.974 --> 22:33.433
I'm Miss Howard of
the New York Police Department.

22:37.648 --> 22:42.734
Well, I can't say Mr. Roosevelt
is a popular man in these parts.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.653
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.356
My pleasure.

23:01.005 --> 23:05.170
Sheriff Early, are you familiar
with what happened here?

23:07.177 --> 23:09.669
I was a deputy at the time.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.842
I seen what was done to them.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.554
And what was done to them?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.762
Butchered.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.687
Like hogs.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.846
This here is the Adam Dury
farm, gentlemen.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.090
Ho, now.
Ho.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.308
Settle, boys.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.382
Hello?

24:36.684 --> 24:38.516
Mr. Dury?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.392
Anybody here?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.902
Mr. Dury, we only want to talk.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.040
Don't suppose you know
where your master might be.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.520
Good morning, Mr. Dury.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.606
Mr. Dury, my name
is John Schuyler Moore,

25:34.742 --> 25:37.109
and I work
for <i>The New York Times.</i>

25:38.078 --> 25:40.161
We've only come to talk.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.657
We know you'd already
left home...

25:43.792 --> 25:45.704
when the event occurred.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.539
"Home."

25:48.130 --> 25:50.338
That's a poor description of it.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.966
You ask me,

25:58.098 --> 26:00.465
old Reverend Dury
couldn't save anyone's soul

26:00.601 --> 26:03.890
with his hellfire and damnation,
let alone redskins.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.562
He weren't a missionary
very long

26:06.690 --> 26:09.603
before he was driven off the
Plains and back to civilization.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.227
And when he come back here,

26:12.362 --> 26:15.321
he brought pictures with him
of dead white folks,

26:15.449 --> 26:20.069
folks he'd seen mutilated in
the Minnesota Massacre of '62.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.079
Pictures?

26:23.207 --> 26:24.914
Photographs.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.122
Awful, they were.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.747
Used to show them
to the town children,

26:32.883 --> 26:34.749
tell them
that's what would happen

26:34.885 --> 26:36.877
if you're not God-fearing.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.214
Nobody liked him much.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.135
Or his wife.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.635
Nobody blamed them Injuns for
coming all the way back here,

26:45.771 --> 26:47.012
stealing their boy Japheth,

26:47.147 --> 26:50.140
and getting revenge on them
for whatever they done out West.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.195
You really think it was Indians
that killed them?

26:52.236 --> 26:55.320
That's what the records
say happened 16 years ago,

26:55.447 --> 26:58.485
and that's what I say happened
16 years ago.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.860
So if you have no more
questions, I'll be on my way.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.828
Don't believe a word he says.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.795
Mr. Dury, we were hoping
to ask you some questions.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.759
I don't speak ill of the dead.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.806
Even if they deserve it.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.811
That <i>is</i> why you're here,
isn't it?

27:33.861 --> 27:34.897
We have no intention

27:35.028 --> 27:37.691
of disparaging your parents,
Mr. Dury.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.906
It's the police investigation
of their deaths

27:40.033 --> 27:41.820
that we believe was flawed.

27:42.578 --> 27:46.993
Perhaps you'd care to talk about
a different aspect of the case.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.491
Tell us about your brother.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.419
Japheth?

27:57.134 --> 27:59.342
What do you want to know
about him?

27:59.469 --> 28:02.587
He'd be in town sometimes
after school,

28:02.723 --> 28:04.055
fetching something
for his mother

28:04.183 --> 28:07.517
or running errands
for his father.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.058
He didn't have any friends,
not with that condition of his.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.182
What condition was that?

28:14.026 --> 28:18.646
His face was always twitching,
like he was in terrible pain.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.403
Adam Dury didn't want
his parents' house.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.154
Nobody did.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.618
I don't blame them.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.708
It's full of ghosts.

28:54.858 --> 28:59.569
I taught him how to hunt
with snares, skin animals.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.404
I thought it would do some good,
but, uh...

29:04.576 --> 29:07.410
But even then,
he couldn't escape her shadow.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.904
Her shadow?

29:15.712 --> 29:18.375
My mother.
She was a...

29:23.428 --> 29:25.795
...a woman with no heart.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.724
With me,
it was mostly indifference.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.764
But, uh, with Japheth...

29:33.563 --> 29:36.522
With Japheth,
she was at him all the time.

29:37.985 --> 29:41.444
Telling him
that he wasn't hers...

29:44.658 --> 29:48.322
...it was man-eating savages
left him on our doorstep.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.701
She said that he was the bastard
child of the red Injun.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.623
And the only time my poor
brother's soul knew any peace

30:01.758 --> 30:04.421
was when he was
in those mountains, climbing.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.639
Spasms in his face would stop,
and he'd be still as a pond.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.473
He stuck to the rock face
like a lizard.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.345
I'd never seen anyone
like Japheth Dury.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.689
You said he had no friends.
Did he climb alone then?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.434
Mostly, though there was a time
someone else climbed with him.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.983
Another fella... a farmhand.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.819
Older.
Took a liking to Japheth.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.402
I trusted him
to look after my brother.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.824
He betrayed that trust.

30:37.627 --> 30:42.747
Mr. Dury... what do you think
happened to your brother?

30:45.886 --> 30:48.674
Japheth came home one night.
He was upset.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.137
Sobbing, cursing...

30:55.729 --> 30:57.891
...bleeding down there.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.167
I'd have ripped
that man's throat out myself

31:07.282 --> 31:09.069
if I'd ever got the chance.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.239
This man... Is he still around?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.363
In a manner of speaking.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.739
What manner is that?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.199
A manner not of this earth.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.749
He died up in the Gunks.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.997
Fell off a 1,000-foot cliff.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.045
It was right around the time
the Durys were killed.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.343
Do you think it was an accident?

31:29.471 --> 31:30.471
An accident?

31:31.056 --> 31:33.423
His throat was cut
from ear to ear.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.969
His eyes were missing.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.517
Do you remember his name?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.729
I won't never forget it.

31:42.609 --> 31:43.816
Beecham.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.604
George Beecham.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.740
Extra! Extra!
More dead kids found!

31:54.871 --> 31:57.454
Come and get your newspapers!

31:57.582 --> 31:59.539
Theodore.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.995
I recently had a meeting
with Chief Byrnes.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.418
Ex-Chief Byrnes.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.340
Ah.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.715
Excuse me. Could you box that up
for me, please?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.133
Certainly.

32:17.018 --> 32:20.307
Look, there's no reason
for you and Byrnes to butt heads

32:20.439 --> 32:22.101
over this child killer.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.690
People aren't ready
for this new,

32:24.818 --> 32:27.310
highfalutin form
of investigation.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.439
They just want
this son of a bitch caught.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.449
It'd scare the people
if they were to find out

32:33.577 --> 32:36.194
that an alienist could
figure out who the killer was

32:36.329 --> 32:37.865
before their police department
could.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.454
Why are you telling me this?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.578
Because...

32:45.714 --> 32:49.173
faith is a terrible thing to
take away from a man, Theodore.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.968
It's like taking away
his future.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.641
You can't stop the future.

33:04.900 --> 33:09.235
The facial spasms, the hunting,
the climbing...

33:09.362 --> 33:10.523
It has to be him.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.442
I don't know why,
but I almost feel sorry for him.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.489
The better angels of our nature.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.067
Laszlo, are you all right?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.027
I don't believe it's hit bone.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.939
You need to tie it off.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.068
Why do you think we've been
followed all the way up here?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.570
Because we know too much.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.537
John, if I don't get away
and you do,

34:05.669 --> 34:07.581
I need you to get someone
a message.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.585
You'll have to deliver
that message yourself,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.208
because I have no intention
of either of us dying today.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.728
Laszlo, we must hurry.

34:28.233 --> 34:31.476
I think it's best
if we stick to the woods.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.452
Is the pain better or worse?

34:50.045 --> 34:51.911
Hard to tell.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.041
I think my brain
has already habituated to it.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.927
What did you want to tell me?

35:00.473 --> 35:02.135
Your message.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.633
Oh, it's nothing.

35:03.768 --> 35:07.603
Oh.
I'm not a fool, Laszlo.

35:07.731 --> 35:11.270
I've been in love enough times
to recognize that look.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.355
"Dull," I think you called it.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.444
Does she know how you feel?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.952
Not the extent of it.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.830
And is it reciprocated?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.628
Yes.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.592
Of course, I...

35:38.720 --> 35:42.509
I suspected it all along, but
to actually hear you say it...

35:48.813 --> 35:50.896
She's wonderful.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.978
She'll make you very happy.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.530
Look after her, Laszlo.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.948
I shall do my best.

36:07.499 --> 36:12.244
Well, I suppose I can brag that
I introduced the two of you.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.428
I'm not speaking of Sara.

36:25.767 --> 36:26.767
Who, then?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.055
Mary.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.188
Mary?

36:39.239 --> 36:41.822
I know it's hard to comprehend.

36:43.326 --> 36:46.569
I've questioned my own feelings
many times.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.573
I told myself it's concern
and duty on my part

36:49.708 --> 36:52.701
and dependence on hers.

36:52.836 --> 36:57.627
Naturally, I realize
how inappropriate it is, but...

36:57.757 --> 37:00.841
there are certain things
a man cannot control.

37:03.555 --> 37:08.391
I told you.
Love resides in the heart.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.725
Nonsense.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.221
It's still physiology.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.776
My brain reacts to qualities
in her that I lack in myself...

37:18.903 --> 37:23.648
kindness... warmth...

37:23.783 --> 37:24.783
courage.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.992
Humility.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.282
That too.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.958
No one deserves it more.

37:51.728 --> 37:52.935
You were jealous.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.519
Come on.

38:00.779 --> 38:04.022
Ow.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.516
Oh, thank you, Mary.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.136
If I didn't know better,
I would think

38:35.271 --> 38:37.479
that you never wanted
your room back.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.317
Ah.
It must be the doctor.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.709
Oh.
Good evening, miss.

39:02.841 --> 39:07.131
Um, pardon us
for letting ourselves in.

39:07.262 --> 39:11.506
Is, uh... the good doctor home?

39:15.937 --> 39:18.896
I mean, certainly
he must be home by now.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.353
We'll just have a look around.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.699
Dr. Kreizler?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.285
Where is he?

39:40.086 --> 39:41.086
Huh?

39:41.671 --> 39:43.628
Where is he?

39:59.898 --> 40:01.764
Upstairs?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.859
I'm sure you've spent
many a fine evening up there.

40:04.986 --> 40:05.820
Huh?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.779
Cat got your tongue, has it?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.740
Fine.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.155
I'll have a look for meself, so.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.039
What do you think you're doing?

40:23.171 --> 40:24.753
Huh?

40:26.966 --> 40:28.628
Answer me.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.630
Run, Mary.
Run!

40:34.432 --> 40:36.424
Run!

40:40.271 --> 40:41.933
Kreizler!

40:43.983 --> 40:45.440
Kreizler!

40:45.568 --> 40:47.355
Where in the name of God is he?!

40:51.324 --> 40:52.610
It's like that, is it?

40:58.873 --> 41:00.580
Come here, you filthy slag!

41:02.710 --> 41:03.871
Come here!

41:10.051 --> 41:11.337
Come here.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.129
Give me that.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.349
Aah!
