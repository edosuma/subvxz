WEBVTT

00:05.905 --> 00:08.708
- Okay, kids, as you know,

00:08.808 --> 00:13.013
our spelling bee team
is heading on to regionals!

00:13.079 --> 00:17.250
So let's bring them out
to show our support.

00:17.350 --> 00:22.422
First up is...
Dakota.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.224
And Nelson.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.259
- Is Mr. B. okay?
He seems very worked up.

00:26.359 --> 00:31.064
- Give it up for Hector.
And Suzie!

00:31.164 --> 00:33.933
And our team captain...

00:34.034 --> 00:38.338
Rahul!
He ain't no tool!

00:38.405 --> 00:40.173
- Rahul's in the house!

00:40.240 --> 00:41.708
- This is for
the spelling bee team?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.076
- Biggest brain on the block,

00:43.176 --> 00:44.611
pre-med out the womb.
- Okay, Rahul.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.846
Quiet down,
I have something I wanna say.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.748
Now, listen, as proud
as I am of you guys,

00:48.848 --> 00:51.584
this year we wanna just have
a little bit more diversity

00:51.684 --> 00:54.387
on the team.
- You can't be serious.

00:54.454 --> 00:57.424
The team couldn't
be more diverse.

00:57.524 --> 00:58.958
- Okay, that is true.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.061
But I'm talking about
intellectual diversity.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.530
I just don't think events
like these should be reserved

01:03.596 --> 01:05.865
just wealthy
and smart families.

01:05.932 --> 01:09.469
- So you want dumb kids
on the spelling bee team?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.371
- No, not like, super dumb.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.039
Just, like, you know,
average dumb.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.142
Like a little sprinkle
of dumbness on a regular kid.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.278
Like Tom dumb.
- "Tom dumb"?

01:18.378 --> 01:20.447
Oh no, leave me out of this.
- Tom, Tom, the path

01:20.547 --> 01:22.549
to all Ivy Leagues schools
starts here.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.417
- I can't imagine
I'm gonna go to college.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.886
- Your school needs you.
They're chanting your name.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.388
- Are they?
No one's chanting at all.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.824
- We want Tom.
- Oh, don't chant, come on.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.792
- We want Tom, we want Tom.

01:32.892 --> 01:36.129
We want Tom.
We want Tom.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.597
- Yay!

01:37.664 --> 01:39.599
- Literally the worst chant
I've ever heard.

01:39.666 --> 01:43.770

young lungs deflate ♪</i>

02:22.709 --> 02:26.713
<i>- Welcome to the New Jersey
State Regional Spelling Bee.</i>

02:26.813 --> 02:28.815
- Spelling bee...
time to spell.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.283
There's a time to spell
and there's a time

02:30.350 --> 02:32.852
to--to get up there
and spell things.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.220
- Tom.
- Hey, hey, Dakota.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.822
- We got you a gift.
- A gift?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.524
- It's from the whole team.
- That's incredible.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.025
What is it, a weird little pin?

02:39.125 --> 02:40.493
- It's got the image of a lion

02:40.560 --> 02:41.895
ripping the heart
out of a griffin.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.731
And it says
"

02:44.831 --> 02:47.167
I will die for
my team" in Latin.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.635
- That's a little intense, no?

02:48.701 --> 02:50.236
- Relax, man, don't take
it too literally.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.172
- You want me to relax?
- Yeah, we won't punch you

02:52.238 --> 02:53.740
straight in the mouth
if you spell

02:53.840 --> 02:55.508
a word wrong or anything.
- Punch me in the mouth?

02:55.575 --> 02:57.043
Why are you even talking
about stuff like that?

02:57.143 --> 02:58.711
- No, if we lose
because of you,

02:58.811 --> 03:00.747
we're not gonna...
murder you.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.582
- Why'd you say it like that?
-

03:02.682 --> 03:04.484
Of course, we're not gonna
take Tom out back

03:04.551 --> 03:06.419
and beat him with a rusty hoe.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.421
Where would we get a hoe?

03:08.521 --> 03:10.490
- I mean who does that?
Murder somebody

03:10.557 --> 03:13.193
because they misspelled a word.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.594
<i>- And they're off.</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:16.162
<i>- Lou, look at you!</i>

03:16.229 --> 03:17.730
You are looking
good today.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.199
- Not as good
as your mom

03:19.265 --> 03:21.601
with her mouth
wrapped around my hey.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.436
- I told you last time I'm not
crazy about those jokes,

03:23.536 --> 03:24.871
but I'm doing good.
Listen.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.839
Give me $100 on
the Knicks taking points.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.008
And give me $250 on the Yanks
just straight up.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.177
- You got it.
- Hey, I have...

03:31.244 --> 03:32.679
Okay, is it between me and you?

03:32.745 --> 03:34.214
- You want to join in with me
and your mom?

03:34.280 --> 03:37.116
-
All right, do you guys

03:37.217 --> 03:40.286
do, like, grade school
spelling bee bets

03:40.386 --> 03:43.423
and shit like that?
- Of course I do spelling bees.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.058
I mean, those parents
are maniacs.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.459
We get tons of action
on that stuff.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.261
- Oh, I love it!
Give me ten grand

03:48.361 --> 03:50.430
on Shady Oaks
Elementary to lose.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.199
- Ten grand to lose?
That's your school.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.235
- I'm not proud of it,
but there's a ton of duds

03:55.301 --> 03:56.703
this year.
Just big duds.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.571
- Yeah, that's
what your mom said--ooh!

03:58.638 --> 04:00.106
- Does anyone love
when you do that?

04:00.206 --> 04:02.208
What's the best way
I should react to that?

04:02.275 --> 04:03.876
- All right!

04:03.943 --> 04:06.980
Who's ready to see some
little kids spell some shit?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.383
Let's see some I before
E except after C, that shit.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.784
Let's go!
- All right, Tom,

04:11.884 --> 04:12.919
don't get nervous.

04:12.986 --> 04:13.987
Don't urinate in your pants.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.421
- Tom.
- What's that?

04:15.488 --> 04:16.990
Whose hand is that?
- Look straight ahead.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.492
Don't make eye contact.
Don't turn around.

04:19.592 --> 04:21.127
- Mr. B?

04:21.227 --> 04:23.329
- I'm gonna discreetly stuff
an envelope in your pocket.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.765
I'm not saying
it contains the answers,

04:25.832 --> 04:27.834
but I'm not saying it doesn't.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.469
- What's happening?
I don't wanna cheat, Mr. B.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.005
- Tom, you have
a moral obligation to cheat.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.974
These other kids have worked
hard all year for this.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.910
Rahul's family flew in
from Chennai for this-

04:37.977 --> 04:39.646
- Just for this?
Are they doing

04:39.746 --> 04:41.614
other things while they're here
or is that the whole trip?

04:41.681 --> 04:43.349
- I don't know, Tom,
I didn't ask.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.685
- It's just a long flight.
- For God's sake, son!

04:45.785 --> 04:49.188
This is the regionals.
Nothing is more important.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.859
These kids study
until they vomit.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.928
Now, get out there
and make me proud.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.331
- Do you think it's possible
you take this

04:58.431 --> 04:59.599
a little too seriously?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.468
- Your first word
is...aardvark.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.137
- Aardvark.
Easy.

05:04.203 --> 05:06.439
A to the A to the R to the D
to the V to the A

05:06.506 --> 05:09.709
to the R to the K.
Aardvark, bitches.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.446
- Okay, that whole thing
was very inappropriate.

05:13.513 --> 05:16.783
- I agree, that was too much.
What was that voice I did?

05:16.849 --> 05:20.486
- Okay, our next
competitor is Tom.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.888
- All right, thanks for
having me, everyone.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.324
I'm ready to spell it up.
Throw one at me.

05:24.390 --> 05:28.227
- Tom, your first word
is...armoire.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.065
- Armoire?
- Oh, come on,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.833
not all kids have "armoires."

05:33.900 --> 05:35.668
- Excuse me.
- We have closets

05:35.735 --> 05:37.203
like normal people.
- Ma'am.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.005
- Tom, just spell closet.
- That is not the word.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.239
- Mom, I've got this.
- Yes,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.309
Tom is
one of our best spellers.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.578
- What are you doing?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.513
- Oh, sorry.
- Is your eye okay?

05:47.580 --> 05:49.349
- I was winking.
I'm not a great winker.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.085
- I think it is time for you
to spell the word.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.387
- Oh, God.
-

05:54.487 --> 05:58.091
- A-R-M-O-I-R-E.
Armoire.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.027
- That is correct!
- Wait, how did he...

06:01.094 --> 06:02.395
- As much as it pains me,

06:02.495 --> 06:04.230
Shady Oaks will
advance to the finals.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.599
- All right, Tom!
- Yes! That was fantastic!

06:06.699 --> 06:10.370
- That's my baby son who knows
how to spell armoire!

06:11.738 --> 06:13.072
- There's my principal.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.942
I did it, what a victory.
What a...

06:16.042 --> 06:17.844
- Tom, get in here.
Close the door, please.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.178
And shove a towel
under the bottom--

06:19.245 --> 06:20.613
really shove it in there good.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.848
And cover your mouth--

06:21.914 --> 06:23.282
- It's not exactly a high-five-

06:23.383 --> 06:24.884
- Cover your mouth
when you talk, please.

06:24.951 --> 06:25.952
- What's going on.
Are you okay?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
- Tom, I know you cheated.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.789
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.691
You know, I just didn't want
to let everyone down.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.259
But hey, we won, right?

06:33.359 --> 06:35.862
- No, Tom, that's the problem.
I gamble on these games.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.363
- Wait, you gamble, what?
- Yes.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.631
And I gambled that we'd lose.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.366
That's why
I placed you on the team.

06:40.433 --> 06:41.801
- I'm not following.
Why?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.369
- Our school budget,
it's a mess.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.637
- Okay.
- So I figured out

06:44.737 --> 06:46.439
I'd add a deadbeat kid
like you

06:46.539 --> 06:47.774
to the team...
- Deadbeat?

06:47.874 --> 06:48.975
- And then I'd bet against us,

06:49.075 --> 06:50.476
and then I would win--
- Okay.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.111
- Listen, up.
Then I would take the money

06:52.211 --> 06:54.313
and funnel the winnings
back into the budget.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.250
- Is this the kind of stuff
you do in here all day?

06:57.316 --> 06:59.419
- Tom, I need you to throw
the next match.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.287
- Nah, I think, you know,
that's where I draw the line.

07:01.387 --> 07:02.822
That feels kind of sleazy.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.390
- Tom, you're already cheating!

07:04.457 --> 07:06.426
All I'm asking you to do
is not cheat!

07:06.492 --> 07:08.060
- Well, if you look at it
that way, yeah.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.929
- Yes, that's the way
I want you to look at it.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.064
- So it's either a scheme
or a hoax, is the basic choice.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.900
- Oh, my God,
you could twist and turn

07:13.966 --> 07:15.435
and make anything look wrong.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.503
- This is exhausting.
Talking to you,

07:17.603 --> 07:18.771
it's always exhausting.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.573
- I know,
I'm literally exhausted.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.008
I'm in a bad mood now.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.110
- Oh, this is nice.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.845
Wow, you didn't have to
throw me a barbecue, Mom.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.580
- I did have to throw you
a barbecue,

07:27.647 --> 07:29.415
because I'm so proud
of you, Tom.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.351
My boy is going to
the state spelling bee.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.320
- Glad you're proud, Ma,
glad you're proud.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.857
- What the... Uncle Bill!
-

07:37.957 --> 07:40.526
- I cannot believe
you drove down from Boston!

07:40.626 --> 07:42.662
- I wouldn't miss this
for the world, 'ey?

07:42.762 --> 07:44.464
Yeah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.466
- Oh, okay.
- Come here, hug your uncle,

07:46.532 --> 07:48.167
you goofy, ugly sonofabitch.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.535
Come here!
- That's a bit much.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.137
it's a bit much.
- Why are you fighting?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.538
- That's a bit--it's a bit mu--
- Listen, hey.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.806
Do me a favor, Tommy.
- All right.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.341
- Spell hot dog.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.542
- Uh-oh, tests!

07:56.642 --> 07:58.377
Okay, okay, let's get into it.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.846
- H-O-T-D-O-G.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.514
- Kid's a friggin' genius.
- There it is.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.649
- Look at you with
the big head, with the words.

08:03.716 --> 08:04.851
All right, now spell bun.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.118
- B-U-N-N.
- Great, right.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.653
- Yes.
- Now spell eat, eat.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.356
- E-A-T.
These are pretty easy words,

08:10.456 --> 08:11.791
Uncle Bill.
- Listen, I gotta ask you--

08:11.858 --> 08:13.526
what's the bathroom
situation here?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.461
I mean, do I go to
the bathroom indoors

08:15.528 --> 08:17.463
or is it anything goes?

08:17.530 --> 08:21.033
- No, no, Uncle Bill, it is not
an anything goes thing.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.669
So we're gonna want you
to go indoors.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.906
- All right, you might
wanna check your driveway.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.878
Tommy, I'm so proud of you.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.246
- Thank you.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.348
- As the two biggest duds
in this family,

08:35.414 --> 08:37.183
we gotta stick together.
You know what I'm saying?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.818
- Well, I don't know if people
lump us together like that.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.386
- Oh, they do, no, they do.
- Yeah, well.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.988
- Listen--

08:42.054 --> 08:44.423
if you ever need help,
I'm here for you, okay?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.993
- I've actually got a pretty
big dilemma on my hands.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.261
Can I share it with you?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.428
- I don't know
what dilemma means.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.730
- I just got a problem.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.198
This whole spelling thing
is a lie.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.433
My coach is making me cheat,
but my principal

08:54.534 --> 08:56.269
wants me to not cheat
and throw the match.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.603
- I'm not known
for my advice...

08:57.703 --> 08:59.605
- Okay.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.107
play by the rules.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.776
If you're honest, you can hold
your head up high

09:03.876 --> 09:06.178
whether you win or you lose.
- That's great advice,

09:06.245 --> 09:09.115
but I'm not a good speller.
I'm going to lose.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.117
- I-I'll--I'll help, okay?
We'll study all weekend.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.119
I'm here, we'll study.
We'll do flashcards,

09:13.219 --> 09:14.620
we'll do spelling books...
- Really?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.122
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:16.222 --> 09:17.690
We'll learn Latin.
- Learn Latin?

09:17.757 --> 09:19.358
That's great!
We should probably start,

09:19.425 --> 09:21.460
like, right away, right?
- Well, let's dive in tomorrow.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.430
Right now
I'm going to butt chug a beer.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.967
- The word is psittaceous--

09:28.067 --> 09:30.937
of or relating to parrots.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.807
- Hey, judge, are you ready
for Rahul to rock your world?

09:34.907 --> 09:38.210
- I don't have any other choice
but to say yes.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.712
Please spell the word.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.047
- Then peep game.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.883
P-S-I-T-T-A-C-E-O-U-S.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.119
Psittaceous.
S-U-C-K-I-T.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.989
- Excuse me?
- J-U-D-G-E.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.591
Suck it, judge.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.659
I am so sorry.
I just get worked up.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.961
I get worked up.

09:55.061 --> 09:59.832
- P-H-A-L-A-E-A-E-N-O-S-I-

09:59.932 --> 10:01.300
- Tom, you're almost up.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.169
Have you reviewed
your secret envelope?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.604
- I don't need
to cheat anymore.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.938
I can win this fair and square.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.506
- No, Tom, you can't.
- I can.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.143
- Your brain is like a small
squirrel's or a ferret's.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.579
- Listen, I've been practicing.
I learned Latin.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.514
- Tom--with whom?
- Just Uncle Bill.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.016
That's all you need to know.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.352
- And what are
your uncle's qualifications?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.287
- I'm not saying
he's an intelligent man, but--

10:21.354 --> 10:22.922
- And what has Uncle Bill
taught you, Tom?

10:22.989 --> 10:25.257
- Listen, Mr. B, I'm sorry;
you steered me wrong.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.859
I'm gonna do this
the honest way.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.294
- Tom!
Oh, my God.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.196
- And when I get
to the Ivy Leagues,

10:30.296 --> 10:31.430
I'm gonna give you a call

10:31.497 --> 10:35.635
from my dorm room
at H-A-V-E-R-D.

10:35.701 --> 10:40.039
- Would that be the university
known as Harvard?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.375
- Different one, diff--I was
talking about a different one.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.877
I spelled it right, trust me.
- Okay, next up,

10:44.977 --> 10:48.681
representing Shady Oaks Elementary, is Tom.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.385
- Tommy! Show 'em
what you learned, baby!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.820
- Come on, Tom!
You can do it, baby, come on!

10:54.887 --> 10:58.824
- Yeah, bend this judge over
and show him who's boss!

11:00.493 --> 11:01.894
I agree, that was too much.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.329
There's a line
and I crossed it.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.064
- Welcome, Tom.
I just want to say,

11:05.164 --> 11:07.500
we took your mother's words
to heart last time,

11:07.566 --> 11:11.470
so we're now including simpler
words that all kids would know,

11:11.537 --> 11:13.906
regardless of income
or social status.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.576
So in the spirit of inclusion,
let's begin.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.047
Your word is... Tom.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.082
- Tom?
That's a crazy coincidence.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.317
That's almost too easy, no?
Tom like me?

11:25.384 --> 11:28.220
- Tom as in
"the male of a species,

11:28.320 --> 11:32.992
colloquially used to describe
turkeys or domestic cats."

11:33.059 --> 11:35.728
- Wow, I think I've got it.
T-O-

11:35.828 --> 11:38.197
- Tom, shut up!
- What--what's happening?

11:38.264 --> 11:40.199
- It's a trick question, Tommy.
- Trick? What?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.702
- Reach down inside you
and pull out your Latin.

11:42.768 --> 11:48.441
- My Latin?
My Latin...

11:48.541 --> 11:50.242
- The derivative suffixes...

11:50.342 --> 11:52.945
Carpe diem... Pro bono... In
absentia... Spell bibliophile!

11:53.045 --> 11:55.214
- Bibliophile,
B-L-I-B-L-I-P-I-H-I-L.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.617
- Spell heliotrope!
- Heliotrope, H-E-L-I-O-P-R-N-.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.786
- And Latin!
- Latin, L-A-T-I-N.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.289
- Again!
- Again, A-G-A-I-N.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.957
- You did it! You did it!
That's great!

12:05.057 --> 12:08.894
- I think I know how to spell!
What's happening here?

12:08.961 --> 12:12.765
The correct spelling
of the turkey version of Tom

12:12.865 --> 12:15.234
is...T...

12:15.301 --> 12:18.571
O...

12:20.873 --> 12:23.976
H-M.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.412
- We were looking for T-O-M.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.748
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my God.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.082
- Is someone challenging
the spelling?

12:30.149 --> 12:32.551
T-O-H-M.
Latin base, Latin roots.

12:32.618 --> 12:34.320
- Tom, your team is eliminated,

12:34.420 --> 12:37.623
and you owe us $300
for the microphone.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.960
Thank you, everyone, goodnight.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.563
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- That was bad.

12:44.630 --> 12:45.998
- I'm so sorry, Priya Auntie.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.501
- I can't believe
we flew 20 hours for this.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.269
- Hey, everybody, guess what?

12:50.336 --> 12:52.772
I bought pizzas and enough for
everybody to have their own.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.074
- We lost, miserably.
Why are we here?

12:55.141 --> 12:56.408
- We got annihilated.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.477
Look how disappointed
my family is.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.679
- Look, life's not always
about winning.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.316
And I know that sounds crazy,
but sometimes losing,

13:04.416 --> 13:07.353
it literally builds
more character.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.255
And I just,
I want to thank you, Tom.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.158
Thank you for showing these
kids what it's like to lose,

13:12.258 --> 13:15.294
and also what it's like
to just be a loser.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.129
- Okay.
- To hold your head up high,

13:17.196 --> 13:19.431
even though you know
people call you

13:19.498 --> 13:21.634
a loser behind your back.
Even the adults.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.602
- I don't know if they do that.
- It's commendable.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.839
You push forward with
the stench of failure upon you,

13:26.939 --> 13:28.374
and I just respect it.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.775
- All right, you know what,
let's wrap this up.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.610
- Everybody, here's to Tom.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.212
To Tom!

13:33.312 --> 13:34.880
- And here's to losing.
- Let's just do--just "to Tom."

13:34.980 --> 13:36.949
To losing!

13:37.016 --> 13:39.285
- Being a loser.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.554
- Hey, what's the bathroom
situation here?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.489
- You're not literally peeing
right now, are you?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.724
- I thought it was okay.
