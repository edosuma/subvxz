06:20.541 --> 06:23.958
the American High Command
is very interested in.

06:23.958 --> 06:27.208
He's being kept at one of the
Nazi's top-secret installations.

06:27.208 --> 06:30.333
They've code named the project--
what is it?

06:30.333 --> 06:32.041

08:13.166 --> 08:14.750
I heard they're sendin' us
and a couple of Wrens

08:14.750 --> 08:16.458
to Bognor
for a two-week holiday.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.333
(Chuckling)

08:25.958 --> 08:28.916
At ease, men.

08:28.916 --> 08:31.833
This is General McCloud,
US Army Intelligence.

08:31.833 --> 08:35.041
Major Kaminski, US Marine Corps.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.541
These men need you to run
a little errand for them

08:37.541 --> 08:39.208
to Poland.

08:39.208 --> 08:44.125
Your target for extraction,
Dr. Aleksander Fabian.

08:44.125 --> 08:46.000
Fabian is one of the world's
leading experts

08:46.000 --> 08:48.416
on solid fuel propulsion.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.166
A rocket scientist.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.583
The Nazis have him.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.083
We want him.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.833
The installation he works at is
under very heavy guard.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.375
But one day a month,
his captors allow him

08:57.375 --> 09:01.166
to spend a night
visiting his wife and daughter.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.958
They're being held
under house arrest elsewhere.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.333
It's a pressure point

09:06.333 --> 09:09.750
to keep his mind focused
on this job.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.041
You will attack the convoy
transporting Dr. Fabian

09:13.041 --> 09:15.208
en route to see his family.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.166
Kaminski.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.750
The best place to attack
is here.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.208
4 miles from the meeting house
at this crossroads.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.500
It has good cover
and Polish resistance tells us

09:22.500 --> 09:25.250
he's escorted
with only a handful of guards.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.958
It's the perfect point
to extract him.

09:26.958 --> 09:28.500
Okay, so we grab this scientist,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.041
but how do we get in and out,
Sir?

09:30.041 --> 09:31.208
Parachute drop?

09:31.208 --> 09:32.666
KAMINSKI:
It's Hitler's back yard.

09:32.666 --> 09:34.458
Flak and fighters everywhere.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.500
Airborne is out, but the Colonel
has something lined up.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.125
You travel to Sweden, tonight.

09:39.125 --> 09:42.125
The Swedes have offered us
their limited co-operation.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.250
Unofficially.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.166
Seems they can sense the tide
of war turning in our favour.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.375
In Borgholm, you'll rendezvous

09:48.375 --> 09:50.833
with a Swedish
fishing boat captain,

09:50.833 --> 09:53.625
who'll drop you here,
near Polish coast.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.666
Major.

09:54.666 --> 09:55.875
Then,
we'll head to the crossroads.

09:55.875 --> 09:56.750
Here.

09:56.750 --> 09:57.875
When we have the target,

09:57.875 --> 09:59.250
we will make our way
into these woodlands

09:59.250 --> 10:00.833
to connect
with Polish resistance,

10:00.833 --> 10:02.250
who will then guide us
to the coast

10:02.250 --> 10:04.708
and transport us by boat
to our rendezvous

10:04.708 --> 10:06.291
with a British Navy sub
in the Baltic.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.291
You'll be joining us, Sir?

10:09.291 --> 10:10.416
That's right.

10:10.416 --> 10:13.000
MCCLOUD:
Major Kaminski speaks Polish.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.958
He'll be leading the mission.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.833
(Takes a deep breath)

10:26.833 --> 10:29.083
This is a tough one, Sir.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.916
Hitting the ground
running like this.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.000
New CO out of the blue.

10:32.875 --> 10:34.708
We all have to play the hand
that's dealt to us.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.666
You know that.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.416
Sir.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.708
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.083
These men
are professional soldiers.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.458
Good,

10:46.458 --> 10:49.041
'cause there's an invasion
of Europe on the horizon.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.125
We need
to be shoulder to shoulder

10:50.125 --> 10:51.791
all the way to Berlin.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.083
(Thunder rumbles)

11:10.375 --> 11:12.833
(Thunder rumbling)

11:15.500 --> 11:18.458
US Marines are meant to be hard
as nails.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.125
Had a few ribbons on him anyway.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.666
Yeah.

11:21.666 --> 11:23.708
They're smooth bastards,
those Yanks.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.000
My sister went out with one.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.250
Yeah,ut she'll go out
with anyone.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.125
(Chuckling)

11:34.833 --> 11:36.791
COOPER:
Alright, Sarge?

11:36.791 --> 11:39.041
Yeah, bloody marvellous.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.666
Yanks breeze in three years
into the bloody war

11:40.666 --> 11:42.083
and start ordering us about.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.833
Hmm.

11:45.250 --> 11:49.125
I want an end to the war,
though, right?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.583
Amen to that.

12:32.125 --> 12:35.458
(Indistinct conversation
in distance)

12:38.125 --> 12:40.458
(Footsteps appraoching)

13:09.291 --> 13:10.208
(Takes a deep breath)

14:16.458 --> 14:18.458
This is as far
as I will take you.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.750
We're still miles
from the shore.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.708
See that?

14:25.875 --> 14:27.666
Those are German patrol boats.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.333
They go up
and down the coast here.

14:30.333 --> 14:33.083
If we are boarded
and they find you here...

14:33.083 --> 14:34.708
It's dark.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.791
We can make it
without them spotting us.

14:36.791 --> 14:39.291
Maybe you signed up
for a suicide mission, Major,

14:39.291 --> 14:40.375
but I haven't.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.458
Or I can just
commandeer this boat

14:41.458 --> 14:42.666
if I choose to.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.166
It's not about
who's at the wheel.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.625
Those patrols
are still out there.

14:45.625 --> 14:46.916
What do you want us to do?

14:46.916 --> 14:48.291
Swim?

14:48.291 --> 14:50.458
SWEDISH TRAWLER CAPTAIN:
There's a boat down on deck.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.916
You row to shore.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.291
Fine.

15:00.291 --> 15:05.000
What would the patrol boats do
if you turn your lights on?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.083
They would board,
check things out.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.833
I will say
I got lost or something.

15:10.833 --> 15:13.291
And once they realize
it's just me,

15:13.291 --> 15:16.333
they will let me go on my way.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.833
So that's what you're gonna do.

15:18.833 --> 15:21.916
When we reach the shore,
you turn your lights on,

15:21.916 --> 15:24.166
you draw them to you.

15:25.416 --> 15:27.625
That I can do.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.708
Make it lower, boys!

16:18.291 --> 16:19.750
KAMINSKI:
Alright, let's go.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.041
(Grunting)

16:47.791 --> 16:50.666
(Static)

16:56.500 --> 16:58.083
How's the radio looking?
We live?

16:58.083 --> 16:59.000
It's not looking good, Sir.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.583
I mean it could
just be a mixture

17:00.583 --> 17:01.708
of the cold and moisture.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.166
Can you fix it?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.708
I'm gonna need some time
to open it up.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.333
Alright, listen,
next time we stop,

17:06.333 --> 17:07.875
see if you can fire it up.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.791
We gotta get moving, alright?

17:08.791 --> 17:10.666
We're behind schedule.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.416
COOPER: Do you think
he can handle himself, Sarge?

17:14.416 --> 17:15.625
I don't know.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.125
We'll find out.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.458
Lucky, he's got us with him.

17:18.458 --> 17:19.750
Let's go.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.041
(Taking deep breaths)

18:42.125 --> 18:43.333
(Preston sighing)

18:43.333 --> 18:44.250
PRESTON: The Swedish
contacts have reported

18:44.250 --> 18:46.583
the trawler dropped them
on schedule,

18:46.583 --> 18:48.625
but still no confirmation
from the team.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.000
(Takes a deep breath)

18:50.000 --> 18:52.250
They also said they had
to drop them short of the coast.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.666
- They what?
- Here.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.875
They made their way
to the landing site

18:54.875 --> 18:56.625
by a smaller boat.

18:56.625 --> 19:00.000
Okay, well, let's just hope
they don't sink like stones

19:00.000 --> 19:01.541
before they even hit the beach.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.625
(Puffing)

19:03.625 --> 19:04.916
That's my team out there.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.875
I have every confidence
they can adapt as needed.

19:06.875 --> 19:07.958
Well, maybe they wouldn't have
to adapt

19:07.958 --> 19:10.083
if your Swedish contacts
could do their jobs.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.750
May I remind you, General,
that my team

19:11.750 --> 19:14.666
are well-versed in dealing
with situations in the field.

19:14.666 --> 19:16.583
I just hope
Major Kaminski can keep up.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.416
Eyes on these trees, both sides.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.916
Alright, look.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.458
the crossroads is 2 miles
down the road that way.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.541
But we're late.

19:43.541 --> 19:44.916
We missed the convoy
on the road.

19:44.916 --> 19:45.791
Oh no, shit.

19:45.791 --> 19:47.666
Shit, indeed.

19:47.666 --> 19:49.041
(Taking deep breaths)

19:49.041 --> 19:50.958
Alright, look, we're gonna aim
for the meeting house.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.125
Catch up with the target there.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.125
Surprise a few people.

19:55.125 --> 19:55.916
(Takes a deep breath)

19:55.916 --> 19:57.250
Let's move.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.875
(Vehicle revving)

21:10.958 --> 21:13.875
(Engine revving)

21:20.666 --> 21:23.666
(Indistinct conversation)

21:24.833 --> 21:27.666
(Dog barking in distance)

21:29.500 --> 21:32.458
(Indistinct conversation)

22:09.416 --> 22:10.625
Bloody hell.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.291
That's got
to be five times the number

22:13.291 --> 22:15.250
we'd have had at the crossroads.

22:15.250 --> 22:19.291
Maybe 20 or more staying
in those two huts.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.875
Looks like our scientist's wife
and daughter arrived

22:20.875 --> 22:22.541
by their own armed guard, too.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.625
Christ.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.333
There's a lot of the buggers,
alright.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.625
Well, do you think
we can pull this off?

22:31.458 --> 22:32.958
I'm not willing
to risk the lives of my men

22:32.958 --> 22:34.500
if the odds
are stacked against us.

22:34.500 --> 22:38.083
We came here to do a job,
so let's get that job done.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.416
You understand me, Sergeant?

22:42.583 --> 22:43.625
Yes, Sir.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.250
Okay.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.458
- Any luck with that radio?
- No.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.000
Nothin'.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.750
It's as dead
as Cooper's love life, Sir.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.416
Oi.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.166
(Fabian chuckling)

23:03.041 --> 23:05.416
(Fabian sighing)

23:38.166 --> 23:40.125
(Sighing)

23:42.541 --> 23:45.458
(Sobbing)

23:54.083 --> 23:55.750
(Sighing)

24:26.958 --> 24:30.541
(Sobbing)

25:00.458 --> 25:03.416
(Chuckling)

25:09.583 --> 25:10.916
Here's the compound.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.958
Cabin's here, road's here.

25:12.958 --> 25:16.208
Fact is, we're outnumbered,
but it's nearly dark.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.333
So we scout around,
find the weak points.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.000
Here for instance.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.625
We hit 'em here and here.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.791
But we'll need a distraction.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.416
So good,
create a distraction here.

25:27.416 --> 25:28.958
So they think there's an attack
coming from the road?

25:28.958 --> 25:30.833
Right.
Throw them off.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.000
We take out
the armed guard here and here.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.541
Use the cover of night.

25:34.541 --> 25:36.833
Use their anti-airguns
against them.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.791
Spread their numbers out a bit.

25:38.791 --> 25:41.041
That way we got a chance.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.250
I'll have
that fuel they got, too.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.000
Get 'em jumpin'.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.125
Yeah.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.625
Alright.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.083
Let's run it back one more time.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.083
(Grunting)

25:58.083 --> 25:59.625
(Screaming)

26:17.375 --> 26:19.625
(Taking a drag)

26:20.916 --> 26:23.833
(Explosion)

26:43.500 --> 26:44.958
(Gunshot)

26:46.041 --> 26:49.625
(Yelling)

26:49.625 --> 26:52.500
(Machinegun fires)

26:55.500 --> 26:57.666
(Yelling in German)

27:03.833 --> 27:06.708
(Machinegun fires)

27:13.625 --> 27:16.750
(Yelling in German)

27:18.208 --> 27:19.416
(Gunshots)

27:19.416 --> 27:21.583
(Yelling in German)

27:24.291 --> 27:26.000
(Grunting)

27:36.541 --> 27:39.416
(Machinegun fires)

28:00.083 --> 28:03.000
(Yelling in German)

28:07.416 --> 28:09.541
(Yelling in German)

28:09.541 --> 28:12.416
(Machinegun fires)

28:14.041 --> 28:16.041
- (Explosion)
- (Screams)

28:23.208 --> 28:25.583
(Gunshot)

28:25.583 --> 28:27.166
(Exhales)

28:27.166 --> 28:28.833
(Speaking in German)

28:31.208 --> 28:32.125
(Gunshots)

28:32.125 --> 28:33.208
(Screaming)

28:33.208 --> 28:35.125
(Grunting)

28:35.125 --> 28:37.208
- Let her go.
- Mama.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.458
I'm going
to walk out of the house

28:38.458 --> 28:40.000
and get in the car.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.250
- (Taking deep breaths)
- Understand?

28:41.250 --> 28:42.083
(Speaking in German)

28:42.083 --> 28:44.541
Ma!

28:44.541 --> 28:46.625
- Mama!
- (Speaking in German)

28:56.916 --> 28:58.208
- (Taking a deep breath)
- (Gunshot)

28:58.208 --> 29:00.583
(Grunting)

29:00.583 --> 29:02.833
- (Gunshot)
- Kalina!

29:03.916 --> 29:05.125
(Grunting)

29:05.125 --> 29:06.041
Mama.

29:06.041 --> 29:08.000
(Kalina grunting)

29:08.000 --> 29:10.125
(Speaking in Polish)

29:10.125 --> 29:11.333
- (Grunting)
- Ma.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.375
Check the inside of the house.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.375
Ma.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.708
(Irena sobbing)

29:14.708 --> 29:15.791
I've checked,
There's no more in there.

29:15.791 --> 29:16.458
Check it again!

29:16.458 --> 29:17.666
- (Speaking in Polish)
- No survivors.

29:17.666 --> 29:18.583
Got that?

29:20.291 --> 29:21.875
(Speaking in Polish)

29:21.875 --> 29:22.750
Mama!

29:22.750 --> 29:24.833
FABIAN:
Kalina! Kalina.

29:24.833 --> 29:26.958
Dr. Fabian,
my name is Major Kaminski.

29:26.958 --> 29:28.000
I'm with the US Marine Corps.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.416
These men are
with the British Army.

29:29.416 --> 29:30.500
We are taking you back
to Britain.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.375
- IRENA: Mama!
- There's a British Navy Sub

29:32.375 --> 29:34.041
scheduled to pick us up
tomorrow.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.666
You'll be flown back
to the USA from Britain.

29:35.666 --> 29:36.750
No, no, no, no, no.

29:36.750 --> 29:37.958
I don't go with you.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.833
- (Taking deep breaths)
- It's for the best.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.166
You will be looked after.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.083
Is this how you look after us?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.250
You just killed my wife!

29:45.250 --> 29:46.250
Ma!

29:46.250 --> 29:47.666
I'm sorry.

29:47.666 --> 29:49.250
- I truly am.
- Ma!

29:49.250 --> 29:51.416
But do you think they were gonna
let you live happily ever after

29:51.416 --> 29:53.208
once they'd gotten
what they wanted from you?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.958
Right now,
I'm offering you a way out.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.916
A chance of freedom,
a chance at your real life.

29:58.916 --> 30:00.333
But we gotta move.

30:00.333 --> 30:03.791
(Taking deep breaths
and sniffling)

30:05.291 --> 30:06.333
(Irena crying)

30:06.333 --> 30:07.500
Okay.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.125
Mama!

30:10.125 --> 30:11.000
(Taking deep breaths)

30:15.625 --> 30:17.125
Okay.

30:17.125 --> 30:20.458
Listen, I go with you only
with my daughter.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.125
- It's clear?
- Of course.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.208
She's gonna slow us down.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.500
The girl comes, too!
No question.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.166
DAVIDSON:
He's right.

30:26.166 --> 30:27.583
Get Cooper to help you
move the mother

30:27.583 --> 30:28.916
inside the house.

30:28.916 --> 30:30.333
Then we'd be ready to leave.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.375
Should we take the jeep?

30:32.375 --> 30:33.500
Negative.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.750
We stay off the roads.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.791
Mama!

30:35.791 --> 30:37.375
(Sobbing)

31:01.916 --> 31:06.166
Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

31:06.166 --> 31:09.833
I never-- I never--
I didn't think...

31:09.833 --> 31:13.500
She hated this war.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.958
She hated everything about it.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.833
Sorry.

31:32.416 --> 31:34.041
(Speaking in Polish)

31:41.875 --> 31:44.750
(Fire crackling)

31:46.416 --> 31:47.625
(Crying)

31:53.583 --> 31:54.958
It's time.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.291
- Are you ready?
- I know.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.833
Please, give us a minute,
alright?

31:58.833 --> 32:01.291
Doctor, you're alive.

32:01.291 --> 32:03.125
Your daughter is alive.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.416
I plan on keepin' you that way,
understand?

32:04.416 --> 32:08.375
But I can't do that
if we don't move.

32:08.375 --> 32:12.208
Okay, okay.

32:14.875 --> 32:15.833
Come on.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.500
Here, hold on to me.

32:18.500 --> 32:22.333
Hold on to me and let's go.

32:25.791 --> 32:27.583
Make sure they get some food.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.833
(Owl hooting in distance)

33:05.958 --> 33:08.291
(Jeep revving)

33:09.708 --> 33:12.583
(Plane passesby)

33:20.250 --> 33:22.041
American Intelligence
have information

33:22.041 --> 33:25.208
that Soviets may be out
to extract Fabian, too.

33:25.208 --> 33:29.041
An NKVD Squad sent undercover
through Poland.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.500
And how long
have your people known this?

33:30.500 --> 33:32.125
I just got word now.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.291
Look, I'm not playing
some poker game with you.

33:34.291 --> 33:37.666
I'm telling you all I know.

33:37.666 --> 33:39.208
I guess it makes sense.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.208
If we want Fabian,

33:40.208 --> 33:44.458
that the Soviets
are gonna want him, too.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.500
Try and contact them again.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.666
Blue Jay, Blue Jay,
this is Cuckoo.

33:48.666 --> 33:50.375
- Do you read me?
- Is there anything else

33:50.375 --> 33:53.875
American Intelligence
have neglected to tell us?

33:53.875 --> 33:56.375
Like I say,
I'm telling you all I know,

33:56.375 --> 33:57.416
as I know it,

33:57.416 --> 33:59.916
live from Radio City Music Hall,
Colonel.

34:32.291 --> 34:33.250
(Sighing)

35:58.458 --> 35:59.916
FABIAN:
Where are they? These partisans?

35:59.916 --> 36:01.250
KAMINSKI:
Camp must have been discovered.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.000
They moved on.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.458
Well, they left in a hurry.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.375
COOPER:
What now, Sarge?

36:06.375 --> 36:07.333
How are we gonna find them?

36:07.333 --> 36:09.083
We remain calm.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.333
Find a way.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.625
(Grunting)

36:19.791 --> 36:21.708
(Sniffling)

36:39.625 --> 36:40.583
(Sobbing)

36:48.833 --> 36:49.958
Here.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.500
It's a small village.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.625
Someone's gotta know
where we can find them.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.375
Is that such a great idea going
to a village?

36:57.375 --> 36:59.916
Hopefully,
my Polish is good enough.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.625
To be honest, I'd feel
a whole lot easier right now

37:01.625 --> 37:03.708
if we could make contact
with HQ.

37:03.708 --> 37:07.250
They don't even know we got
to the shore in one piece.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.000
Worth trying again?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.250
Needs a good hour's work
with a soldering iron.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.833
Right now, it's scrap metal.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.125
(Taking deep breaths)

37:16.125 --> 37:17.750
We go to the village.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.000
It's the only option.

37:55.791 --> 37:57.458
So we're just
gonna walk in there and ask?

37:57.458 --> 37:58.791
Not all of us.

37:58.791 --> 38:00.333
Davidson, come with me.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.666
Keep everyone else out of sight.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.375
I still think
it's a hell of a risk, Sir.

38:05.375 --> 38:07.041
It's 20 miles
across enemy territory

38:07.041 --> 38:08.500
to the pickup.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.250
We need the partisans.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.125
They know the routes.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.833
Maybe they have
some safe transport we can use.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.833
And most of all, a radio.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.000
Plus, Lee needs medical help.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.125
Look I know it's not ideal,

38:23.125 --> 38:27.375
but I can't see
any other option.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.416
Take this.

38:30.416 --> 38:31.541
(Grunting)

38:31.541 --> 38:32.750
You know,
my Polish isn't too hot,

38:32.750 --> 38:34.791
right, Sir?

38:34.791 --> 38:38.958
In Poland, if you stay quiet,
don't speak too much,

38:38.958 --> 38:40.833
they think you're the smart guy.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.625
Perfect.

39:01.958 --> 39:04.833
(Indistinct chatter)

39:17.916 --> 39:19.625
(Chuckling)

39:59.500 --> 40:02.083
We had no other option.

40:05.291 --> 40:07.416
Your boat was found.

40:07.416 --> 40:10.083
Every German in the whole area
is on alert, looking for you.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.625
So help us.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.166
We need to find the partisans.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.916
Their camp was abandoned.

40:14.916 --> 40:17.500
There are
German collaborators all over.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.833
Someone in the village
sold them out.

40:19.833 --> 40:22.250
So the partisans moved on
two days ago.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.083
Look, we need to find them.

40:24.083 --> 40:27.083
We need to make contact
with our HQ.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.958
(Speaking in polish)

40:31.958 --> 40:33.583
Go north.

40:33.583 --> 40:35.208
The main road out of town.

40:35.208 --> 40:37.125
At the first crossroads,
leave the road.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.166
Head up the hill.

40:38.166 --> 40:40.375
You'll find them,
but be careful.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.875
Thank you.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.291
Now, go
before you get us all hung.

41:08.416 --> 41:09.916
(Taking deep breaths)

41:53.166 --> 41:56.458
(Motorcycle revving)

41:57.916 --> 41:59.291
(Gun cocks)

42:39.041 --> 42:41.833
(Gunfires)

42:44.500 --> 42:45.583
(Gunshot)

42:46.833 --> 42:48.125
PRESTON:
Could be any numbers of reasons

42:48.125 --> 42:49.791
why they haven't reported in.

42:49.791 --> 42:50.875
I don't even wanna think

42:50.875 --> 42:53.125
what those reasons could be yet,
Colonel.

42:53.125 --> 42:54.375
Weather report, Sir.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.916
That storm front is building
in the Baltic.

42:55.916 --> 42:57.958
Oh.

42:57.958 --> 42:59.250
Well, this isn't good.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.958
These men won't be able
to get a boat out to the sub

43:01.958 --> 43:02.791
for the pickup.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.916
There's got to be another way
of gettin' them out.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.750
We've done a supply drops
to the partisans here

43:07.750 --> 43:09.666
using C-47s out of Italy.

43:09.666 --> 43:13.000
That's a long haul,
but extra fuel, at night,

43:13.000 --> 43:14.791
a C-47 could make that.

43:14.791 --> 43:16.500
And we'd still have to find
somewhere for it to land.

43:16.500 --> 43:17.500
Somewhere the men can get to.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.375
C-47 is a good
rough field performer.

43:19.375 --> 43:21.250
They just put down,
and pick up, and take off.

43:21.250 --> 43:23.041
You make it sound easy.

43:23.041 --> 43:24.250
This plane still
has to travel miles

43:24.250 --> 43:26.583
across enemy territory,
pick up the men,

43:26.583 --> 43:29.041
and then get back
in the daylight

43:29.041 --> 43:30.166
without getting shot down.

43:30.166 --> 43:32.625
And we have no way
of contacting the team.

43:32.625 --> 43:34.875
If Kaminski's
got a chance in hell

43:34.875 --> 43:36.333
of gettin' what we came for,

43:36.333 --> 43:37.708
you really
wanna leave 'em marooned,

43:37.708 --> 43:38.750
because we didn't back 'em up?

43:38.750 --> 43:41.791
No, I agree.

43:41.791 --> 43:43.916
- A plane could land there.
- MCCLOUD: What's that?

43:43.916 --> 43:47.333
Polish Airfield,
it's no longer used.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.375
If he could lead 'em
to the causeway instead.

43:49.375 --> 43:50.625
They still have
to coordinate perfectly.

43:50.625 --> 43:51.750
But it's not gonna wait for 'em.

43:51.750 --> 43:53.375
Taxi, and pick up, take off.

43:53.375 --> 43:55.208
Harris, see if you can
contact them again.

43:55.708 --> 43:56.583
HARRIS:
Blue Jay, Blue Jay.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.458
This is Cuckoo.
Do you read me?

44:00.583 --> 44:02.458
Blue Jay, Blue Jay,
this is Cuckoo.

44:02.458 --> 44:03.666
Do you read me?

44:06.375 --> 44:09.291
(Grunting)

44:13.250 --> 44:14.458
Let's take a break.

44:14.458 --> 44:17.291
(Taking deep breaths)

44:22.750 --> 44:25.583
(Taking deep breaths)

44:27.458 --> 44:30.250
Lean on this.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.208
Like this.

44:31.208 --> 44:32.375
Thanks.

44:32.375 --> 44:34.375
- That's it.
- Alright.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.166
Nice one, Doc.

44:36.166 --> 44:38.000
Simple physics.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.041
Maybe you can take look
at his leg when we next stop?

44:41.041 --> 44:42.791
I'm not that kind of doctor.

44:42.791 --> 44:45.375
(Taking deep breaths)

44:45.375 --> 44:47.708
Do you really think
we can trust these partisans?

44:47.708 --> 44:50.541
They got us the information
on where the doctor was.

44:50.541 --> 44:52.458
The timetable
of when he'd be there.

44:52.458 --> 44:54.208
Everything.

44:54.208 --> 44:56.208
Look, someone wears a uniform.

44:56.208 --> 44:57.458
I know which side they're on--

44:57.458 --> 44:59.916
You know damn well,
civilian armed groups

44:59.916 --> 45:01.916
or partisans
or whatever you wanna call 'em,

45:01.916 --> 45:04.250
get mixed up in this war.

45:04.250 --> 45:05.291
It's just the way it is.

45:05.916 --> 45:07.375
Right now, we gotta hope
we can trust them--

45:07.375 --> 45:08.250
(Gunshots)

45:14.250 --> 45:19.166
(Yelling in German)

45:25.000 --> 45:28.625
(Yelling in German)

45:28.625 --> 45:29.625
Move!

45:29.625 --> 45:31.375
(Yelling in German)

45:31.375 --> 45:33.875
(Gunshots)

45:33.875 --> 45:34.791
German patrol!

45:34.791 --> 45:37.208
Five, maybe six!

45:37.208 --> 45:39.458
- (Yelling in German)
- Guys, get down!

45:39.458 --> 45:42.416
(Yelling in German)

45:42.416 --> 45:45.333
(Gunshots)

45:55.083 --> 45:58.875
(Yelling in German)

45:58.875 --> 46:01.750
(Gunshots)

46:03.458 --> 46:04.583
(Explosion)

46:04.583 --> 46:06.208
(Screaming)

46:10.291 --> 46:12.208
(Yelling in German)

46:22.916 --> 46:25.791
(Indistinct chatter)

46:34.791 --> 46:36.916
Thanks for gettin' us out
of a hole back there.

46:36.916 --> 46:39.916
We are an American and British
joint task force.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.041
You in command?

46:41.041 --> 46:42.000
Major Kaminski.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.125
SARA:
Kaminski?

46:43.125 --> 46:45.250
Are you Polish?

46:45.250 --> 46:46.583
On my father's side.

46:46.583 --> 46:48.500
- Look, we--
- Save it.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.166
All of you, this way.

46:51.166 --> 46:54.625
(Indistinct chatter)

47:16.208 --> 47:17.333
STANEK:
Whose side are you on?

47:17.333 --> 47:19.000
We had orders to rendezvous
with you

47:19.000 --> 47:21.041
at your camp in the forest.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.583
And how were we to know
you decided to move.

47:22.583 --> 47:23.625
Look, we know it was risky,

47:23.625 --> 47:24.791
but it was the only way.

47:24.791 --> 47:26.458
Listen to me.

47:26.458 --> 47:27.583
We moved camp,

47:27.583 --> 47:29.625
because of traitors
in the village

47:29.625 --> 47:31.375
And you walk in there.

47:31.375 --> 47:32.500
(Chuckles)

47:32.500 --> 47:34.750
Damned Americans.

47:34.750 --> 47:36.083
You have all the manpower,

47:36.083 --> 47:38.416
but you have no idea
how to fight a war.

47:38.416 --> 47:39.333
Do you know how many graves

47:39.333 --> 47:41.041
litter the countryside
around here?

47:41.041 --> 47:43.125
Those who helped the resistance.

47:43.125 --> 47:46.250
I'm sorry,
but it was the only way.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.625
You need to understand
how important this mission is.

47:48.625 --> 47:50.291
Important?

47:50.291 --> 47:52.666
You come all this way,
risk our necks for this.

47:52.666 --> 47:53.750
This Nazi collaborator.

47:53.750 --> 47:54.916
We should shoot him!

47:54.916 --> 47:56.375
Then the pigs--

47:56.375 --> 47:58.833
Then the German pigs
can't use him anymore!

47:58.833 --> 48:00.500
Hey!
Listen to me.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.500
He's important.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.000
We need him on our side.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.583
He's been working
on all the rocket tests

48:04.583 --> 48:06.125
for the Nazis.

48:06.125 --> 48:07.750
FABIAN:
Uh, sorry.

48:07.750 --> 48:09.416
Uh, I--
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

48:09.416 --> 48:13.291
but I know nothing
about rockets.

48:13.291 --> 48:17.708
No, uh, I'm working in the field
of nuclear fission.

48:19.541 --> 48:21.458
Atoms.

48:23.083 --> 48:26.125
Everything is made of atoms.

48:26.125 --> 48:29.291
This metal.

48:29.291 --> 48:35.583
This-- the dirt here.

48:35.583 --> 48:36.625
You.

48:36.625 --> 48:39.541
Even you.

48:39.541 --> 48:43.500
All made
of these tiny building blocks.

48:43.500 --> 48:47.333
So small, but perfect.

48:47.333 --> 48:49.083
What are you talking about?

48:49.083 --> 48:50.791
FABIAN:
When these atoms are split,

48:50.791 --> 48:54.333
they can generate
the huge amount of the power.

48:54.333 --> 48:58.791
And this kind of power could
light a million light bulbs.

48:58.791 --> 49:01.666
Bright as the sun.

49:01.666 --> 49:04.083
We can use it
to power whole cities.

49:08.875 --> 49:17.291
Or in theory, it could have
the great explosive power.

49:17.291 --> 49:20.250
That's what I was working on
for the Nazis.

49:20.250 --> 49:23.416
They want me to make a new kind
of weapon.

49:23.416 --> 49:24.958
Like mustard gas?

49:24.958 --> 49:30.833
No, no, much--
much more terrible.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.416
Where is this weapon?

49:35.416 --> 49:37.958
FABIAN:
There is no weapon yet.

49:37.958 --> 49:40.083
But I had to keep them believing
I could do it.

49:40.083 --> 49:44.791
If not, they would have
killed my family.

49:44.791 --> 49:46.625
Alright, listen to me.

49:46.625 --> 49:49.500
Now maybe we weren't
told everything.

49:49.500 --> 49:51.500
But this potential weapon
he's talking about,

49:51.500 --> 49:53.208
sounds like it could
kill more Nazis

49:53.208 --> 49:54.666
than you or I could kill
in a lifetime.

49:54.666 --> 49:56.791
Do you understand?

49:56.791 --> 49:58.583
We need to get this man back.

49:58.583 --> 50:02.500
(Taking deep breaths)

50:21.625 --> 50:24.416
Thanks, Major.

50:24.416 --> 50:25.916
Do you have a radio?

50:25.916 --> 50:27.666
Yeah.

50:27.666 --> 50:29.416
Cuckoo, Cuckoo,
this is Blue Jay.

50:29.416 --> 50:30.666
Do you copy?

50:32.583 --> 50:34.500
(Static)

50:34.500 --> 50:35.666
Cuckoo, Cuckoo,
this is Blue Jay.

50:35.666 --> 50:38.000
Do you copy?
Over.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.708
Oh, thanks.

50:48.833 --> 50:51.750
(Puffing)

50:53.583 --> 50:56.250
I've done a few
of these missions.

50:56.250 --> 50:58.375
None quite like this one,
though.

50:58.375 --> 50:59.916
It's just getting to me a bit.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.833
Men should feel something
when they kill.

51:02.833 --> 51:03.958
(Puffing)

51:10.875 --> 51:12.166
(Static)

51:12.166 --> 51:13.291
Cuckoo, Cuckoo,
this is Blue Jay.

51:13.291 --> 51:15.083
Do you copy?
Over.

51:15.083 --> 51:17.000
(Static)

51:18.791 --> 51:20.125
Cuckoo, Cuckoo,
this is Blue Jay.

51:20.125 --> 51:21.750
Do you copy?
Over.

51:26.291 --> 51:27.666
Cuckoo, Cuckoo,
this is Blue Jay.

51:27.666 --> 51:28.916
Do you copy?
Over.

51:29.416 --> 51:30.083
PRESTON:
Blue Jay,

51:30.083 --> 51:33.500
this is Cuckoo receiving you.
Thank God.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.250
We were a little worried.

51:35.250 --> 51:36.500
Do you have the egg?

51:36.500 --> 51:39.458
Repeat, do you have the egg?

51:39.458 --> 51:41.833
KAMINSKI:
We have the egg, Cuckoo.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.541
We ran into some problems,
but are now receiving help

51:43.541 --> 51:44.458
from the cousins over here.

51:44.458 --> 51:45.208
Over.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.541
PRESTON:
Blue Jay, we have a new venue

51:46.541 --> 51:49.083
for your coming out party.
Copy?

51:49.083 --> 51:52.625
Here's where you need to be,
Mallard 53.

51:52.625 --> 51:54.208
Goose 72.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.000
PRESTON:
Repeat.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.791
Mallard 53, goose 72.

51:58.791 --> 52:00.166
Copy, Blue Jay?

52:00.166 --> 52:01.791
Copy that, Cuckoo.

52:01.791 --> 52:04.666
The party starts
at 07:00 tomorrow.

52:04.666 --> 52:06.833
The bird will be there,
but they can't wait for you.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.000
Do you understand?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.541
Copy, 07:00 tomorrow.

52:09.541 --> 52:11.416
(Static)

52:13.458 --> 52:15.500
One more thing,

52:15.500 --> 52:17.458
you may have
some unwanted company

52:17.458 --> 52:19.583
from your Uncle Joe.

52:19.583 --> 52:23.541
Repeat, you may encounter
some friends of Uncle Joe's.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.666
Be ready for that, Blue Jay.

52:25.666 --> 52:27.333
Copy.

52:27.333 --> 52:28.833
Do you copy, Blue Jay?

52:28.833 --> 52:30.708
Did he get that last part?

52:30.708 --> 52:31.625
I don't know.

52:38.833 --> 52:40.375
Sub pick-up is out.

52:40.375 --> 52:42.500
They're picking us up by air
tomorrow.

52:42.500 --> 52:44.375
This old airfield here.

52:44.375 --> 52:47.125
Well,
they must really want this guy.

52:47.125 --> 52:48.541
Then we better keep him safe.

52:56.416 --> 52:59.208
Hey.

53:34.875 --> 53:35.958
Mmhmm.

54:14.750 --> 54:18.166
The Germans have
rounded up half of the village.

54:18.166 --> 54:19.166
Will you fight with us?

54:19.166 --> 54:21.041
Look, we just fought hard
to get our hands on him,

54:21.041 --> 54:23.083
I can't just lead him
into battle.

54:23.083 --> 54:25.708
We will help you get
to your plane, Major.

54:25.708 --> 54:28.916
But will you help our people
in return?

54:28.916 --> 54:31.208
What did you say,
your father was Polish?

54:31.208 --> 54:35.583
Then these are your people, too.

54:35.583 --> 54:37.000
You need us.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.875
Is it not the least you can do?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.458
KAMINSKI:
Alright.

54:45.458 --> 54:47.416
We support them,
no direct combat,

54:47.416 --> 54:49.500
coverin' fire only.

54:49.500 --> 54:51.500
- Keep them out of the way.
- Okay.

54:51.500 --> 54:53.250
We're running low
on ammo, though.

54:53.250 --> 54:54.416
Do you have any spare guns?

54:54.416 --> 54:56.416
Yeah.

55:08.416 --> 55:11.291

Tank, 2:00!

57:36.708 --> 57:37.666
Fire!

57:40.541 --> 57:42.666

57:44.750 --> 57:47.666
(Gunfires)

(Grunts)

58:09.458 --> 58:10.750
Fire!

58:13.375 --> 58:15.750
Hold the fire!

58:15.750 --> 58:18.916
(Yelling in German)

58:21.291 --> 58:24.541
(Yelling in Polish and German)

58:28.250 --> 58:31.125
(Yelling in Polish)

59:08.458 --> 59:11.625
(Yelling in Polish)

59:21.708 --> 59:23.541
We need to move!

59:23.541 --> 59:25.250
This way.

59:25.250 --> 59:26.416
Move, move!

59:32.500 --> 59:33.625
Come on!

59:33.625 --> 59:35.791
(Yelling in Polish)

59:47.750 --> 59:50.291
(Gunfires in distance)

59:56.500 --> 59:57.791
(Conversation in German)

1:00:15.041 --> 1:00:19.458
We need a C-47 on the ground,
07:00, tomorrow.

1:00:19.458 --> 1:00:22.375
Map reference and full briefing.

1:00:22.375 --> 1:00:25.958
Look, as you know, the weather
over that whole area is--

1:00:25.958 --> 1:00:28.375
We need that plane there.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:31.208
I don't have
to tell you how risky this is.

1:00:31.208 --> 1:00:32.875
I'm putting good crew
on the line here.

1:00:32.875 --> 1:00:34.416
Flying half way across Europe.

1:00:34.416 --> 1:00:36.166
Your men better be there
at the right time.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:37.583
They'll be there.

1:00:40.625 --> 1:00:41.791
Jesus, I don't know

1:00:41.791 --> 1:00:43.375
how in hell you guys
made it through this war

1:00:43.375 --> 1:00:45.500
with all your red tape
and bullshit.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:46.833
He's right
to point out the risks.

1:00:46.833 --> 1:00:47.833
And you're right.

1:00:47.833 --> 1:00:49.083
We did make it through
without you.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:50.833
Thank you, General.

1:00:52.166 --> 1:00:54.250
Look, I know I'm putting
the screws to you guys,

1:00:54.250 --> 1:00:57.625
but you gotta understand
Fabian is the key.

1:00:57.625 --> 1:00:59.583
He's the missing piece
to a puzzle

1:00:59.583 --> 1:01:04.583
that could end this war
and save millions of lives.

1:01:04.583 --> 1:01:05.583
Where are we going?

1:01:05.583 --> 1:01:06.916
I know a safe place.

1:01:06.916 --> 1:01:09.291
We can hide out
until your plane arrives.

1:01:09.291 --> 1:01:12.166
(Taking deep breaths)

1:01:12.166 --> 1:01:13.791
Come on, Waitesey,
you're slowin' us up.

1:01:13.791 --> 1:01:16.666
(Taking deep breaths)

1:01:18.125 --> 1:01:20.458
What's wrong?

1:01:20.458 --> 1:01:22.750
We lost Cooper and Lee, Sarge.

1:01:22.750 --> 1:01:24.416
Did you not notice?

1:01:49.666 --> 1:01:50.833
Come, sit down.

1:01:53.958 --> 1:01:56.541
(Takes a deep breath)

1:01:56.541 --> 1:01:58.416
(Grunting)

1:01:58.416 --> 1:01:59.833
DAVIDSON:
How's the wound?

1:01:59.833 --> 1:02:01.750
Yeah.

1:02:01.750 --> 1:02:03.875
I've had worse, Sarge.

1:02:03.875 --> 1:02:06.416
I've had worse.

1:02:06.416 --> 1:02:07.791
Let me see.

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:10.166
Nevertheless.

1:02:10.166 --> 1:02:11.750
We have some medicine.

1:02:11.750 --> 1:02:14.250
I'll see if there is something
for the pain.

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:19.625
Just a scratch.

1:02:26.125 --> 1:02:27.666
Lot of hot water.

1:02:27.666 --> 1:02:28.958
I will take care of it.

1:02:38.208 --> 1:02:40.000
I don't know what's what here.

1:02:42.791 --> 1:02:44.000
This one.

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:49.541
There is some food here, too.

1:02:49.541 --> 1:02:52.625
It's Spam.

1:02:52.625 --> 1:02:55.041
Spam, I can recognize.

1:03:01.208 --> 1:03:04.083
(Waites grunting)

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:19.375
(Footsteps approaching)

1:03:20.541 --> 1:03:22.041
I want to show you something.

1:03:28.875 --> 1:03:30.333
Your father
was quite a collector.

1:03:30.333 --> 1:03:31.625
Yeah.

1:03:31.625 --> 1:03:33.375
He was a good fighter.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:34.833
One of our best.

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:38.833
(Grunting)

1:03:38.833 --> 1:03:40.416
That's okay,
it's just a bit of shrapnel

1:03:40.416 --> 1:03:41.541
from those bloody mortars.

1:03:41.541 --> 1:03:42.625
Let me see.

1:03:42.625 --> 1:03:44.125
No, it's fine.

1:03:44.125 --> 1:03:46.250
Take off your coat.

1:03:46.250 --> 1:03:48.166
Sit down.

1:03:54.875 --> 1:03:56.666
(Grunting)

1:03:58.333 --> 1:04:00.583
I need to clean it
and get a dressing on it.

1:04:11.791 --> 1:04:14.500
(Grunting)

1:05:23.125 --> 1:05:26.041
(Puffing)

1:05:31.333 --> 1:05:33.958
I want to explain to you.

1:05:33.958 --> 1:05:36.416
Earlier,
when my hand was shaking--

1:05:36.416 --> 1:05:37.708
(Sniffles)

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:41.791
I can still do what I need to.

1:05:41.791 --> 1:05:44.666
Like I-- I can still do the job.

1:05:44.666 --> 1:05:46.750
You can.

1:05:46.750 --> 1:05:48.000
(Chuckling)

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:58.166
You know, everything
in this line is secret.

1:05:58.166 --> 1:06:01.041
I can't tell anybody.

1:06:03.166 --> 1:06:05.041
And some of the things
I have done...

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:13.416
...I'm not proud of them.

1:06:13.416 --> 1:06:14.791
What things?

1:06:21.125 --> 1:06:24.583
About a couple of years ago,
we were parachutin' into France.

1:06:26.208 --> 1:06:27.541
And there was this town
where the locals

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:30.916
were being paid by the Germans
to give 'em information.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:35.083
There was this house.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:41.000
And we had orders to shoot
and kill

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:42.583
everyone in
and around this place,

1:06:42.583 --> 1:06:44.041
no exceptions.

1:06:48.916 --> 1:06:52.416
All of them?

1:06:52.416 --> 1:06:55.791
That were the orders.

1:06:55.791 --> 1:06:57.541
I had to get rid of them all.

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:06.875
They'd come home,

1:07:06.875 --> 1:07:10.666
just be hangin' the washing
at home,

1:07:10.666 --> 1:07:16.625
we'd shoot and kill them.

1:07:16.625 --> 1:07:17.500
I mean
they were collaborators,

1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:23.375
but it wasn't right.

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:24.875
And we shot women.

1:07:28.583 --> 1:07:30.041
And we shot children.

1:07:40.416 --> 1:07:47.916
You know, they were our orders,
but we could have said no.

1:07:47.916 --> 1:07:50.625
I can still see their faces.

1:07:50.625 --> 1:07:53.291
It's alright.

1:07:53.291 --> 1:07:55.416
It's alright.

1:07:55.416 --> 1:07:56.625
It's alright.

1:08:03.250 --> 1:08:05.916
(Fabian sighs)

1:08:22.583 --> 1:08:25.416
(Fabian takes a deep breath)

1:08:28.583 --> 1:08:29.500
(Fabian sniffles)

1:09:17.541 --> 1:09:18.916
(Sniffles)

1:09:24.291 --> 1:09:27.291
(Footsteps approaching)

1:09:27.291 --> 1:09:28.791
(Sighing)

1:09:28.791 --> 1:09:33.458
I need to ask you
what are our chance, Major?

1:09:33.458 --> 1:09:35.833
The plane will be there.

1:09:35.833 --> 1:09:37.958
But we have another 3 kilometres
to cross at dawn to get

1:09:37.958 --> 1:09:41.208
to the pick-up.

1:09:41.208 --> 1:09:42.791
3 kilometres,
in a previous life,

1:09:42.791 --> 1:09:45.625
that's a country walk.

1:09:51.416 --> 1:09:53.708
(Sighing)

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.708
Do you have someone back home,
Major?

1:10:00.708 --> 1:10:01.958
A wife.

1:10:01.958 --> 1:10:05.125
And a little boy.

1:10:05.125 --> 1:10:08.416
6 months old.

1:10:08.416 --> 1:10:09.416
I've never seen him.

1:10:09.416 --> 1:10:13.250
Just a photograph
his mother sent me.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:17.250
(Takes a deep breath)

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:19.791
I know your country needs me
working on their research.

1:10:19.791 --> 1:10:23.375
I mean I know your mission is
to take me back,

1:10:23.375 --> 1:10:29.833
but if it comes to saving me
or her,

1:10:29.833 --> 1:10:34.291
I beg you as a father,
save her.

1:11:03.291 --> 1:11:04.958
(Grunting)

1:11:08.041 --> 1:11:11.541
(Grunting)

1:11:24.250 --> 1:11:25.375
(Taking deep breaths)

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:30.625
(Grunts)

1:11:34.791 --> 1:11:36.666
(Grunting)

1:11:36.666 --> 1:11:37.541
WAITES:
Doc, up.

1:11:37.541 --> 1:11:39.791
Up.

1:11:43.291 --> 1:11:46.208
(Grunting)

1:11:49.416 --> 1:11:51.375
(Speaking in Polish)

1:11:51.375 --> 1:11:52.041
(Shushing)

1:11:53.208 --> 1:11:54.291
DAVIDSON:
What's goin' on?

1:11:54.291 --> 1:11:56.083
We got company.

1:11:56.083 --> 1:11:57.291
This German patrol.

1:11:57.291 --> 1:11:58.625
Four of the fuckers.

1:11:58.625 --> 1:11:59.625
(Taking deep breaths)

1:11:59.625 --> 1:12:01.083
And they got the Major.

1:12:01.083 --> 1:12:02.791
(Grunting)

1:12:02.791 --> 1:12:07.291
(Speaking in Polish)

1:12:07.291 --> 1:12:09.000
(Grunting)

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.708
Fuck!

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:12.416
WAITES: I can't see any
more of 'em coming.

1:12:12.416 --> 1:12:14.458
Something is wrong.

1:12:14.458 --> 1:12:16.458
Their accents.

1:12:16.458 --> 1:12:18.000
They're not German.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:18.958
They're Russians.

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:20.083
Russians?

1:12:28.083 --> 1:12:29.541
You up for this?

1:12:29.541 --> 1:12:31.166
Try me.

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:32.458
Stay with them.

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:37.375
He's got a clean shot
on all of you.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:39.916
So don't move a fuckin' inch,
okay?

1:12:42.916 --> 1:12:44.291
They're Russians, Major.

1:12:48.291 --> 1:12:51.458
American?

1:12:51.458 --> 1:12:58.250
We salute you in joining us
in our great struggle.

1:12:58.250 --> 1:12:59.916
The scientist.

1:12:59.916 --> 1:13:00.958
Where is he?

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.458
He's coming with us.

1:13:05.208 --> 1:13:08.625
Uh, I think there's a problem.

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:10.041
Yeah?

1:13:10.041 --> 1:13:12.916
I don't think your team
are going to make it.

1:13:12.916 --> 1:13:15.791
That is as good as handing him
back to the Nazis.

1:13:15.791 --> 1:13:17.583
Is that what you want?

1:13:17.583 --> 1:13:19.500
Well, I got orders.

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:21.166
So like I told you,
he's coming with us.

1:13:21.166 --> 1:13:24.333
Well, I have orders, too, Major.

1:13:24.333 --> 1:13:26.375
This is a little difficult.

1:13:26.375 --> 1:13:29.125
Brothers
and allies arguing like this.

1:13:29.125 --> 1:13:30.000
I'm not your brother.

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.375
You've done just as much harm
to this country

1:13:31.375 --> 1:13:33.250
as the Nazis have.

1:13:33.250 --> 1:13:34.916
(Shushing)

1:13:43.958 --> 1:13:45.541
(Taking deep breaths)

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:48.791
(Taking deep breaths)

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:51.958
SARA:
You!

1:13:51.958 --> 1:13:54.708
Drop the guns on the floor!

1:13:56.708 --> 1:13:59.750
Drop the guns on the floor now
or he's dead!

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:02.916
Got that?

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:04.708
I'll do it.

1:14:04.708 --> 1:14:06.666
I swear I will.

1:14:10.083 --> 1:14:12.250
You people,

1:14:12.250 --> 1:14:16.375
you tear our country apart
with your wars.

1:14:16.375 --> 1:14:20.750
You, the Germans.

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:24.666
Don't even breathe!

1:14:24.666 --> 1:14:26.375
Get your people in the car.

1:14:26.375 --> 1:14:27.666
Then nobody--

1:14:32.750 --> 1:14:36.541
(Grunting)

1:14:45.083 --> 1:14:46.666
(Gunfires)

1:14:52.416 --> 1:14:55.666
(Speaking in Polish)

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:57.916
Davidson, Fabian.
Get the car.

1:14:57.916 --> 1:14:59.041

1:15:03.791 --> 1:15:06.333
(Speaking in Polish)

1:15:06.333 --> 1:15:09.166
You won't make it, American.

1:15:09.166 --> 1:15:10.333
Come on, come on, come on.

1:15:13.250 --> 1:15:15.166
(Grunting)

1:15:28.041 --> 1:15:30.916
C-47 is 20 minutes
from the extraction point.

1:15:30.916 --> 1:15:32.541
Let's hope they have someone
to pick up.

1:15:32.541 --> 1:15:33.958
They'll be there.

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:52.791

1:21:52.500 --> 1:21:53.458
Okay.

1:21:53.458 --> 1:21:54.875
Let's go!

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:55.833
(Yelling in German in distance)

1:21:55.833 --> 1:21:56.833

1:24:44.125 --> 1:24:46.541
How you doin', Major?

1:24:46.541 --> 1:24:48.458
Okay, Sir.

1:24:48.458 --> 1:24:49.625
Thanks.

1:24:52.166 --> 1:24:54.625
Did Fabian make it to the US?

1:24:54.625 --> 1:24:58.583
Officially, I can't tell you.

1:24:58.583 --> 1:25:00.958
Unofficially, I hear he did.

1:25:00.958 --> 1:25:05.125
We lost a lot of good men, Sir.

1:25:05.125 --> 1:25:08.208
Some of the best
I've served with.

1:25:08.208 --> 1:25:10.791
Major,
this war's like a street fight.

1:25:10.791 --> 1:25:12.833
Some street fight.

1:25:12.833 --> 1:25:15.291
I grew up on the South Side
of Chicago.

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:17.416
Tough place.

1:25:17.416 --> 1:25:19.041
The guy who won there
was the guy

1:25:19.041 --> 1:25:22.916
who was willing to do something
the other guy didn't dared do.

1:25:22.916 --> 1:25:28.000
Gouge an eye, pull a knife,
pull a gun.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.500
If you hesitate, you're dead.

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:35.583
There's a lot of dead, alright.

1:25:38.833 --> 1:25:42.125
I bet there'll be a lot more
if Fabian's research pans out.

1:25:42.125 --> 1:25:46.000
Well, officially, I definitely
can't tell you that.

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.541
Thank you, son.

1:25:48.541 --> 1:25:50.083
Thank you.

1:25:50.083 --> 1:25:51.833
And Godspeed.

1:26:02.333 --> 1:26:04.125
Is that your family, Sir?

1:26:08.625 --> 1:26:09.916
It is.

1:26:13.416 --> 1:26:16.000
You lookin' forward
to goin' home, private?

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.208
Yes, Sir.

1:26:17.208 --> 1:26:18.541
And you?

1:26:18.541 --> 1:26:19.750
I don't think I got
that million-dollar wound,

1:26:19.750 --> 1:26:21.666
you know?

1:26:23.458 --> 1:26:25.208
A blighty wound, Sir!

1:26:27.916 --> 1:26:30.958
(Airplanes passesby)

1:26:30.958 --> 1:26:33.541
Yeah, I don't think
I'll be goin' home just yet.

1:26:43.250 --> 1:26:45.416
(Indistinct chattering)

1:26:53.541 --> 1:26:54.750
Hmm?

1:26:54.750 --> 1:26:56.083
Mm, mm.
