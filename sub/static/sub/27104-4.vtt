08:32.846 --> 08:34.681
(laughter)

08:34.723 --> 08:37.601
Mr. Weissman, you should be
on the stage.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.728
-A pen will do.
-Ah.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.938
And keep the pen.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.231
MIDGE:
Three-legged race.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.691
-You're on.
-Good-bye, ladies.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.361
-Hello, Midge.
-Gabi. Good to see you.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.446
-How are the kids?
-Happy and healthy.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.531
And how far along
in the process are you?

08:51.573 --> 08:52.824
-The process?
-With him.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.952
-Joel?
-(growls)

08:54.993 --> 08:58.497
Oh, well, it's all kind of new,
and we're still figuring it out.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.207
He'll actually be up here
later today.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.626
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.752
Why?

09:03.794 --> 09:08.257
Well, the kids are his,
and he likes them,

09:08.298 --> 09:10.509
so he'll be coming back
and forth from the city.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.386
How modern.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.721
So I'll see you two ladies
at the salon?

09:14.763 --> 09:15.931
-Yes, you will.
-Mm-hmm.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.809
Good-bye, Gabi.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.561
Oh, God.
Is this what it's gonna be?

09:21.603 --> 09:23.855
(groans):
Grr.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.607
-There you go.
-PAULY: Okay.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.484
Now that you're all signed in,
let me introduce you

09:27.526 --> 09:29.194
to your boy for the summer,
Mr. Weissman.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.738
Oh, well, no introduction
necessary.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.533
-I raised Jimmy from a pup.
-Oh, it's not Jimmy.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.411
This is Samuel.
He's one of my best young boys.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.745
What happened to Jimmy?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.497
Good news.
There were some stumbles,

09:40.539 --> 09:42.666
but he was finally accepted
to the internship he wanted.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.877
-Isn't that great?
-But I...

09:45.919 --> 09:47.546
Good for Jimmy.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.966
I'm at your service,
Mr. Weissman.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.093
Your hand is wet.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.511
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Attention, guests.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.221
Just a reminder that orientation
in the main hall

09:56.263 --> 09:57.681
is one hour away; see you there.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.141
You know the way, friends.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.726
Bring everything in the trailer,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.644
and there's a couple of things
in the trunk.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.522
There's a baby in the backseat,
Mr. Weissman.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.982
Bring that, too!

10:07.024 --> 10:08.817
SAMUEL:
Right.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.653
ABE:
Ah, that beautiful lake!

10:11.695 --> 10:13.697
(door creaks)

10:15.699 --> 10:17.617
-Good morning.
-Ah, gentlemen.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.619
-I'll take this one.
-I'm right here, Mr. Weissman.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.163
MIDGE: Whew! It needs
to air out a little.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.539
ABE:
Come on, guys. Hustle, hustle.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.291
ROSE: All the furniture's
in the wrong place.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.667
-MIDGE: We'll move it around.
-ABE: I left a diagram

10:25.709 --> 10:27.294
-for them last time.
-Well, they know how we like it.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.712
-It should've been ready.
-MIDGE: Those go to

10:28.754 --> 10:29.963
the second bedroom!
The one on the left.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.256
ABE:
The screen door needs adjusting.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.008
SAMUEL:
I can do that for you, sir.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.718
ABE: Or someone from the proper
department can fix this, Jimmy.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.720
-It needs to be done right.
-MIDGE: Sorry,
I meant right, not left.

10:36.762 --> 10:37.888
-Right. Right.
-SAMUEL: Right. Right.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.973
ROSE: Abe, make sure the windows
are open upstairs.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.516
-ABE: Right, got it.
-MIDGE: There's
no room for this.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.185
ROSE: Just wedge it in,
then move that piece over here.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.519
No, no, don't put it
on the couch.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.979
ABE: There's new carpeting
on the stairs.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.647
MIDGE: Put it back, guys.
We've got to figure this out.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.774
ROSE:
I've already figured this out.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
MIDGE: You just put the couch
on the chair.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.152
-ROSE: This is more luggage
than last year.
-It's way more.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.236
ABE:
Oh, beautiful day.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.696
ROSE: The luggage is piling up
in the kitchen.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.782
MIDGE: Oh, watch the lamp!
Watch the lamp!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.825
-Was this tree here last year?
-SAMUEL: Which tree?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.827
-I think it was there, Papa.
-ABE: I don't remember

11:00.869 --> 11:02.829
-this big tree being there.
-ROSE: Oh, there's
an extra chair in here.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.456
SAMUEL: Can I help you
with the tree, Mr. Weissman?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.541
ABE: How could you possibly
help me with the tree?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.043
Explain yourself.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.045
MIDGE:
Ah, I forgot Esther's doll.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.755
-ROSE: Which one?
-Betsy Wetsy.
I knew I forgot something.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.465
ROSE: We'll have Jimmy run out
for a new doll.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.008
MIDGE: That'll wet itself?
It has to wet itself.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.885
ABE:
What's the couch doing outside?

11:16.927 --> 11:18.887
-ROSE: It's just temporary!
-ELIANA: Oh, Midge.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.556
-ABE: It'll get dirty out here.
-Oh, sorry about Joel, Midge.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.934
-MIDGE: It's okay, Eliana.
-Are you devastated?
-Fresh tomato juice, sir?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.228
You were getting luggage; now
you're bringing me tomato juice?

11:26.269 --> 11:28.563
ELIANA: Oh, good, good,
you should move on. Such a cad.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.232
MIDGE: There's one too many
cooks in the kitchen.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.817
ROSE:
There's a cook in the kitchen?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.735
-Watch out!
-ABE: Oh!
-(glass breaks)

11:33.777 --> 11:36.488
-ABE: Jimmy!
-ROSE: There's tomato juice
everywhere!

11:36.530 --> 11:38.323
-SAMUEL: I'll get a mop!
-Oh, Abe.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.325
-MIDGE: Where's the towel?
-We need some help here.

11:40.367 --> 11:44.329
ABE: And he forgot the baby.
Jimmy, bring a mop and the baby.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.082
-MIDGE: Why is
the couch outside?
-ROSE: I don't know.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.333
I think the layout
in there works.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.043
I think it works, too.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.212
And I think it's exactly the way
it was when we got here.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.214
-But I think we've proven
that it's right.
-Mm.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.675
-All situated, ladies?
-Yes, Pauly, thank you.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.552
Abe's upstairs.
I'll get him for you.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.970
Abe!

12:00.011 --> 12:02.264
Actually, I'm here
to talk to Miriam.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.015
-Mind if I sit?
-No. Pauly, please.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.101
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Carl Finger. Paging Carl Finger.

12:06.143 --> 12:09.479
Not an emergency, but not
not an emergency, either.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.565
Now, orientation is
in a few minutes,

12:11.606 --> 12:14.443
-so I don't want
to keep you long.
-Sure. What's up?

12:14.484 --> 12:17.154
(clears throat) It's about
the swimsuit competition.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.197
-Mm, the Mrs. Steiner Pageant?
-What about it?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.782
We're all aware
of your record, Miriam.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.994
What a feat: eight wins in a row
in three different categories.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.204
And you get lovelier every year,
just like your mother.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.956
-Oh.
-But this year, I think we have

12:27.998 --> 12:30.041
a new and exciting
proposition for you.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.752
-Fun. What is it?
-Sash girl.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.296
Sash girl?

12:34.337 --> 12:35.922
But the sash girl
doesn't compete.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.674
She just hands the sash
to the winner.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.718
-That's right.
-But what if I win?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.094
I hand the sash to myself?

12:41.136 --> 12:42.471
The photograph
will look ridiculous.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.473
Look, you've competed as a teen,

12:44.514 --> 12:46.766
as an ingénue, and in
the Mrs. Steiner Pageant

12:46.808 --> 12:49.394
these past four years, but
this year, we're hard-pressed

12:49.436 --> 12:52.481
to make the argument that
you are any of those things.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.192
Not after the recent change
in your situation.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.776
But I'm technically
still married.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.987
Yes, but the Mrs. Steiner
Swimsuit Pageant winner

12:59.029 --> 13:00.697
is always accompanied
by her husband.

13:00.739 --> 13:04.326
And having him there with you...
might cast a pall.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.828
-I see.
-But of course
we want you there,

13:06.870 --> 13:08.788
and that's why
we'd like you to enjoy the honor

13:08.830 --> 13:10.415
of handing the sash
to this year's winner.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.666
But what about
the weird old lady

13:11.708 --> 13:12.918
who always hands out the sash?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.586
That would be my grandmother.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.713
Sorry.
Won't she be disappointed?

13:16.755 --> 13:19.174
-She passed.
-So I guess she won't mind.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.760
I appreciate your understanding.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.429
And on the bright side,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.932
you're free to load up
on rice pudding tonight.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.060
(chuckles)
See you at orientation.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.145
Hershey?

13:32.187 --> 13:34.481
I just got kicked out
of the swimsuit pageant.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.233
That does it.

13:36.274 --> 13:40.237
You're definitely wearing
the Mamie Van Doren.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.364
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Paging Leon Zigglestein.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.616
Please come get your wallet
at the front desk.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.284
Mr. Leon Zigglestein.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.120
-(lively chatter)
-Ah.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.122
PAULY:
Let's all grab seats, everybody.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.667
We'll begin here in a minute.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.752
Miriam Maisel.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.587
Alya Feinburg, good to see you.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.214
-You, too.
-And how's Marv?

13:59.256 --> 14:01.007
Uh, I can't get him off
the links.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.842
A widow to golf,
and yet so young.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.929
I thought we should touch base
about this thing with Joel.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.223
-All right.
-The four of us have spent

14:08.265 --> 14:10.767
so much time together up here,
playing charades,

14:10.809 --> 14:13.770
the bowling team,
all the stuff friends do.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.647
-Yes?
-Well, Marv and I

14:15.689 --> 14:16.898
(whispers):
discussed it,

14:16.940 --> 14:18.900
and we were pretty much
in agreement that

14:18.942 --> 14:21.319
he's actually a better friend
of Joel's than I am of yours.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.821
-Okay. I get it.
-So...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.614
We'll still run into each other.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.074
Buffet line, bathroom.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.701
-I'm glad you understand.
-Mm-hmm.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.619
So are you changing your name?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.371
-To Zippy Maisel.
-Really?

14:31.413 --> 14:32.998
-No.
-You're fun.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.126
-Just not as fun as Joel.
-Bye.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.838
PAULY:
All right, here we go.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.591
-Good afternoon, my beauties!
-CROWD: Hi, Pauly!

14:42.632 --> 14:45.010
Now, most of you know me,
but for those who don't,

14:45.051 --> 14:49.389
I'm Pauly Auerbach, just
beginning my 18th fabulous year

14:49.431 --> 14:52.017
as your Steiner
executive director.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.977
And, oh, boy,
I'm gonna have a heart attack

14:54.019 --> 14:55.562
from all the exciting activities

14:55.604 --> 14:57.689
we got planned
for you this season!

14:57.731 --> 15:00.108
(crowd cheering)

15:00.150 --> 15:02.485
Now, each of you

15:02.527 --> 15:05.363
will find a Steiner newsletter
under your seat,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.949
Issue Number One for 1959.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.410
And if you think
you notice a fun new font,

15:10.452 --> 15:13.038
you're not wrong. Good eye.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.665
Oh, finally!
I hated the old font, hated it.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.667
PAULY:
In it is a map of the property,

15:17.709 --> 15:19.878
some things you need to know,
and of course

15:19.919 --> 15:22.589
a list of upcoming activities
for the week.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.507
And here's hoping
that our returning guests

15:24.549 --> 15:26.843
will take all you newcomers
under their wing

15:26.885 --> 15:28.803
to give them
the lay of the land,

15:28.845 --> 15:31.431
and to show them what's mud
and what's bear bleep.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.350
(laughter)

15:33.391 --> 15:35.018
Now, there is a young man here

15:35.060 --> 15:37.020
that a lot of you already
know and love,

15:37.062 --> 15:38.772
our entertainment director,
Buzz Goldberg.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.358
Come on up
and take the mic, Buzz.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.903
Hello, Steinerites!
How's everybody doing?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.073
(crowd cheering)

15:48.114 --> 15:51.284
You all may not have met me,
but you know what I do:

15:51.326 --> 15:53.078
-I manufacture fun.
-(crowd murmurs excitedly)

15:53.119 --> 15:55.163
And it seems like I could
whip up a little right now.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.374
-What do you say?
-(cheering)

15:57.415 --> 16:00.168
Hey, now, what are all these
employees doing standing around?

16:00.210 --> 16:02.837
Get on up here
and help me lead the group

16:02.879 --> 16:05.048
in the "Steiner Resort
Welcome Song."

16:05.090 --> 16:06.800
(crowd whooping)

16:06.841 --> 16:08.593
(plays note)

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
One, two, three, four.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.681
(to "Carolina in the Morning"):

16:40.834 --> 16:42.961

Let's see how he does, folks.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.381
(continues holding note)

16:46.423 --> 16:49.634
I hit some traffic.
Did I miss the bear shit joke?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.803
-Yes, you did.
-Ah, hell.

-(feet stomping rhythmically)

17:12.031 --> 17:15.493
We're finer! Finer! Finer!

17:15.535 --> 17:17.912
-How's it going here
since you arrived?
-Steiner. Steiner.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.415
-Fine, I guess.
-(crowd continues chanting)

17:20.457 --> 17:23.209
-Anybody mention
anything about...?
-Us? Oh, yeah.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.044
Me, too.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.589
I was here ten minutes, and
I got corralled by three people.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.965
I've gotten it all day.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.592
They even kicked me
out of the swimsuit pageant

17:30.633 --> 17:32.427
'cause I'm no longer a missus.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.221
-What?
-I get to be sash girl.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.974
But sash girl
just hands out the sash.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.018
Pauly has spoken.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.436
Steiner!

17:41.478 --> 17:43.438
Good job!
Applaud yourselves, everyone!

17:43.480 --> 17:46.107
(crowd cheering)

17:46.149 --> 17:48.193
Anything I can get for you,
Mr. Weissman?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.819
PAULY:
Thank you, Buzz. Great job.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.988
You'll never be Jimmy.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.449
PAULY: Now, friends, last year
there was some kvetching

17:54.491 --> 17:57.285
that the resort was short
on certain recreation equipment.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.746
Well, listen to me
and listen to me carefully.

17:59.788 --> 18:03.750
This year,
there will be more hula hoops.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.919
-WOMAN: Yeah!
-There will be

18:05.960 --> 18:08.630
-more floaties.
-(whooping, clapping)

18:08.671 --> 18:11.090
And there will be more balls!

18:11.132 --> 18:14.052
(crowd cheering)

18:14.093 --> 18:16.221
JOEL:
Nothing to see here, Asher!

18:16.262 --> 18:18.097
PAULY:
On a happier note,

18:18.139 --> 18:20.099
let's wish all our newlyweds
mazel tov, yes?

18:20.141 --> 18:22.644
Some of whom met right here
at Steiner Mountain Resort

18:22.685 --> 18:25.480
and made a blessed,
lifelong commitment.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.940
Are you kidding me?

18:26.981 --> 18:28.691
There's Izzy and Enid Schulburg.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.945
Neil and Phyllis Cohen.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.406
And Allie and Taavi Applebaum,
who met playing shuffleboard.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.536
To all our happy couples,
may you have life, luck,

18:39.577 --> 18:41.663
and lots
of little Steinerites!

18:41.704 --> 18:43.456
(applause)

18:43.498 --> 18:44.624
What are you doing?

18:44.666 --> 18:46.543
Hey, Steiner guests,
can I get your attention?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.378
Sorry, Pauly.
This'll just take a second.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.673
Most of you know me.
Joel Maisel.

18:51.714 --> 18:55.426
And an awful lot of you
are staring at me. And Midge.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.178
Now, you know
what happened to us.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.722
We're separated, okay?
But we're still close.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.683
Our families are close.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.601
And we love our kids,
and they both love us,

19:03.643 --> 19:05.103
so everything's fine.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.856
Really, there's nothing
to stare at here.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.108
You can still be friends
with me, or not.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.360
And you can still be friends
with Midge, or not.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.820
It's up to you.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.989
And, Pauly, shame on you
for not letting Midge

19:16.030 --> 19:18.157
in the Mrs. Steiner
Swimsuit Pageant.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.034
She's eight years a champion
and a huge draw,

19:20.076 --> 19:21.578
and every $25 award she won,

19:21.619 --> 19:23.496
she donated to an orphans home
in the Bronx.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.666
So this year, thanks to you,
some orphans are going hungry.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.418
(crowd murmurs)

19:28.459 --> 19:30.253
So we're clear? Yes?

19:30.295 --> 19:32.005
-(man coughs)
-Good.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.508
So, have fun, everybody.
See you dockside.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.554
PAULY:
Always expect the unexpected

19:39.596 --> 19:41.598
here at Steiner Mountain Resort.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.600
Well, you know
what I always say.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.018
Abi gezunt!

19:45.059 --> 19:47.520
-Everybody! Abi?
-CROWD: Gezunt!

19:47.562 --> 19:50.189
-PAULY: Well, that's all that's
on the docket, everybody.
-(applause)

19:50.231 --> 19:52.650
So enjoy your summer,
enjoy your stay,

19:52.692 --> 19:55.278
because before you know it,
it'll be over.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.906
I'll see you tonight.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.534
ANNOUNCER: Steinerites,
the pool is now open.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.703
Remember, we have
our salon appointments later.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.288
-I will be there.
-Mm-hmm.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.956
-So what building are you in?
-Hmm?

20:06.998 --> 20:09.626
What building?
Are you north side, south side?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.753
-Oh, shit.
-What?

20:11.794 --> 20:14.005
-I don't have a room.
-You don't have a room?

20:14.047 --> 20:16.090
I'm always in the cottage
with you and your parents,

20:16.132 --> 20:18.134
so it didn't even
occur to me to book one.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.844
Still getting used
to some things, I guess.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.138
Well, go see if they have
something available.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.599
I heard people talking.
There's a gigantic waiting list.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.976
Such an idiot.
Guess I'll go back.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.978
Don't go back.
You just got here.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.980
I could throw myself
on the mercy of Pauly,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.982
but I don't think he's
my closest friend right now.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.777
Look, just stay on our sun porch
till you figure it out.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.445
Really?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.614
Ethan can sleep out there
with you. He'll love it.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.115
Will your parents love it?

20:41.157 --> 20:43.201
They'll be fine.
I'll make it fine.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
Okay. Thanks.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.499
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Attention, guests.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.125
Tonight's vodka
and latke mixer will be

20:51.167 --> 20:52.961
in the rec room at 8:00 p.m.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.088
The ladies just headed out
to the salon.

20:55.129 --> 20:58.424
Yeah, Rose told me that was
where they were heading.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.594
Abe... I promise
I won't be in your way.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.554
I'll store my stuff
under the staircase.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.807
You'll never see it.
You'll hardly know I'm here.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.141
It's fine, Joel.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.685
Sorry, with everything going on,

21:08.726 --> 21:10.311
booking a room
just slipped my mind.

21:10.353 --> 21:11.980
Ah, it's fine, really.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.440
A room will open up soon enough.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.237
Anything else?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.615
Look, Joel,
up here in the mountains,

21:22.657 --> 21:25.243
I do...
different kinds of things.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.828
You drink a lot of tomato juice.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.956
Not just the tomato juice.
I have a morning routine.

21:29.998 --> 21:33.334
Every day, before the sun's up,
when everyone's asleep,

21:33.376 --> 21:36.671
I do my special
outdoor calisthenics.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.172
I didn't know that.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.258
And I wear special clothing.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.843
And now that you're down here,

21:41.884 --> 21:44.178
you're bound to see me
when I head out.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.014
-Special clothing?
-A romper, Joel.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.016
-I wear a romper.
-What's a romper?

21:48.057 --> 21:49.684
It's a one-piece
exercise outfit.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.935
Oh.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.479
Very tight-fitting,
and no one has seen me in it,

21:53.521 --> 21:55.106
not even Rose.

21:55.148 --> 21:59.652
But now, you may see me in it.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.988
You should be prepared.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.449
Okay.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.581
Anything else?

22:11.622 --> 22:13.958
I'm wondering if I should
put it on and show it to you.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.294
-Oh, no, Abe, no.
-Just so we can get beyond it.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.962
I really don't think
that's necessary.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.839
-You haven't seen it.
-I sleep very deeply.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.592
Really, don't even
think about me.

22:22.633 --> 22:26.387
Okay. I'll try not to.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.934
(slurps loudly)

22:31.976 --> 22:34.562
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): Ladies,
Chef Seymour Silver invites you

22:34.604 --> 22:36.314
to join him
in the trailside lounge

22:36.355 --> 22:38.316
at 2:15 for
a garniture demonstration.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.359
That's 2:15
in the trailside lounge.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.196
You know, he hypnotized her
at the mesmerism show last year,

22:43.237 --> 22:45.281
and to this day, she still
clucks like a chicken

22:45.323 --> 22:46.908
-when you clap your hands.
-No.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.077
-(Midge laughs)
-All that clucking
at orientation,

22:49.118 --> 22:50.661
that was Lottie Friedman.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.747
I'll give her this,
she clucks on the beat.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.290
(laughter)

22:54.332 --> 22:56.209
Oh, you see Saul over there?

22:56.250 --> 22:58.544
-ROSE: Oh, dear.
-EDIE: You know, his wife died.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.921
Yes, a tragedy.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.506
Well, she's not dead
three months

23:01.547 --> 23:03.382
when he turns around
and marries her kid sister.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.550
Joanie?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.344
But the man is still
on the prowl; look at him.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.346
At the "End of Summer" soirée
last year,

23:08.387 --> 23:10.098
he danced with Leah Bernstein.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.100
And when he pressed
up against her,

23:12.141 --> 23:14.102
she could feel his excitement.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.104
Oh, kind of wishing
you hadn't said that.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.772
It may have been a pocketknife.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.441
(chuckles):
Yes, a pocketknife!

23:20.483 --> 23:23.111
Well, I'll see you two tonight.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.530
My God, you look like sisters.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.825
-If only. See you tonight, Edie.
-Bye, Edie.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.078
Let's get you
to the dryers, ladies.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.997
Mama, thanks for letting Joel
stay with us for a few nights.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.458
He got stuck, and I want him
to see the kids.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.335
Oh, it was fine.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.045
I'll get you some lemonade.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.464
It was very nice what he did
at the orientation.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.174
Surprisingly manly.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.009
Let's hope it stops
all this silliness.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.261
From your lips.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.679
Relationships should be private.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.222
-Don't you think?
-Amen.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.890
So, are you dating?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.267
-What?
-Are you dating?

23:54.308 --> 23:55.977
What's your dating life?
I know nothing.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.396
I guess my dating life
doesn't get to be private.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.232
You're just out late so often,
what else would it be?

24:01.274 --> 24:05.820
Well, as a matter of fact, yes,
I am dating a little bit.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.738
Anyone I know?
Anyone from the neighborhood?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.574
No, I'm kind of just
getting around.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.409
I mean, not "getting around."

24:11.450 --> 24:13.661
It's just that I'm not being
geographically snobby.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.121
-You know?
-I guess.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.123
I'm kind of hitting
all five boroughs.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.833
Well, that doesn't seem right.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.543
Don't your friends have anyone
to set you up with?

24:20.585 --> 24:22.378
-Nope.
-Not even that little
blonde thing

24:22.420 --> 24:23.921
that talks all high and chirpy?

24:23.963 --> 24:26.841
Imogene. Nope, all her friends
are Gentiles.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.886
Oh. Well, tell me about these
Jewish men you're seeing,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.013
like that man that gave you
the fur coat.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.140
-Fur coat?
-You wore it to synagogue
last year.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.185
-What is he, a furrier?
-No, a trapper.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.103
But it was a short-lived thing.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.147
He was a little
Paul Bunyan for my taste.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.065
-You dated a trapper?
-And a cab driver.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.525
-You didn't.
-And a carny.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.319
I actually met the carny,
oddly enough,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.321
because the date with
the cab driver was so awful

24:48.362 --> 24:49.697
I told him to let me
out of the car,

24:49.739 --> 24:51.115
and we were in Coney Island,
and I got out,

24:51.157 --> 24:52.325
and there was the carny.

24:52.366 --> 24:53.743
-My God.
-So he and I had a drink.

24:53.784 --> 24:54.952
And it was nice.
And he introduced me

24:54.994 --> 24:56.704
to his sister,
Koo Koo the Bird Girl,

24:56.746 --> 24:58.206
but I thought,
"Where could this go?"

24:58.247 --> 25:00.124
Koo Koo was nice,
but I don't want to end up

25:00.166 --> 25:01.209
living in a circus tent.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.211
-Is this a joke?
-It's the truth.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.879
Are you intimate
with any of these men?

25:04.921 --> 25:06.422
Oh, no, it hasn't gotten
that far.

25:06.464 --> 25:07.965
-But, Miriam, when...
-Mm, sorry, Mama.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.884
If I don't start now,
my hair will never dry,

25:09.926 --> 25:11.510
and I'll be late picking up
Esther from the sitter.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.012
Pick it up, Goldie.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.014
I'm glad we talked, though.
It's been weighing on me.

25:15.056 --> 25:18.267
-Okay, but I'm gonna keep
on the lookout for you. Okay?
-(dryer whirring)

25:18.309 --> 25:21.520
-What?
-(louder): I'm gonna be
on the lookout for a man.

25:21.562 --> 25:24.607

This is my Catskills
alcohol-consumption index.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.348
I drink more up here,
but I've devised a system

25:57.390 --> 25:59.433
to keep from getting tipsy.

Why is that so hard to say?

26:55.156 --> 26:58.868
Hope everybody enjoyed
the sheet cake for dessert.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.077
I know I did.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.288
I didn't think it tasted
like sheet at all.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.248
-(laughter)
-So corny.
-And how.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.460
(laughing):
That's hysterical.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.754
So, now put on
your dancing shoes

27:09.795 --> 27:12.048

27:22.266 --> 27:24.185
Ken starts playing

It's too easy, no?

27:25.936 --> 27:28.481
No, tradition calls
for having a little fun

27:28.522 --> 27:30.274
with the first dance,
right, everybody?

27:30.316 --> 27:31.692
-Dance challenge.
-Dance challenge.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.569
-Get up, get up, get up.
-BUZZ: That's right.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.572
It's time for a dance challenge.

27:36.614 --> 27:39.283
And here is your challenge:
you don't dance

27:39.325 --> 27:41.952
unless you find a partner
that has...

27:41.994 --> 27:44.413

27:50.211 --> 27:52.797
(quiet laughter)

27:52.838 --> 27:54.548
Uh, here it is:

27:54.590 --> 27:56.842
your dance partner must have...

27:56.884 --> 27:59.470
first and last initials
that match your own.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.138
-Otherwise, you don't dance.
-(crowd exclaiming)

28:01.180 --> 28:02.431
An "Initial Dance."

28:02.473 --> 28:04.809
-BUZZ: Are you ready?
-Yes!

28:04.850 --> 28:07.561
Then let
the Initial Dance begin!

28:07.603 --> 28:09.605
-(lively dance music begins)
-Ooh, M.M.
-M.M.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.899
-Marvin Mueller.
-No, Mitzi Mossberg
has already grabbed him.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.442
Ooh, damn. Who else, who else?

28:13.484 --> 28:15.194
Menashe Morgenstein. Where's he?

28:15.236 --> 28:16.946
-Oh, on a kibbutz.
-Fucker.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.782
-Dance with Sheldon Babiatz.
-No, not the concept, Papa.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.200
Shoot, they're going fast.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.785
Ooh, Marty Micklestein,
12 o'clock.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.537
His name's not Marty,
it's Buddy.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.288
No, his name's Marty,
but everybody calls him Buddy.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.792
That's why he's still available.
Go, go!

28:29.834 --> 28:32.628

28:32.670 --> 28:34.380

28:42.263 --> 28:45.224
Okay, Morty,

28:45.266 --> 28:47.226
BUZZ:

28:47.268 --> 28:48.686
Now let's mix it up a little.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.230
Guys, cut in and dance
with the beauty of your choice.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.274
It was a pleasure, Morty.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.235
-Whoa! Too close?
-(grunts)

28:56.277 --> 28:57.945
Uh, any closer, I'd be
on the other side of you.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.905
Yeah. So, did you hear
I married Aunt Joan?

28:59.947 --> 29:02.408
My kids call her Aunt Joan.
I just call her Joan.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.910
-Mazel tov, Saul.
-(chuckles)

29:04.952 --> 29:06.704
Oh, hey, Feivish.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.456
-What's wrong?
-Do you know Marnie?

29:08.497 --> 29:10.082
The cutie from Canarsie? Sure.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.001
She won't even look at me
no matter what I do.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.586
-And what are you doing?
-Nothing.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.254
Oh, Feivish.
What am I gonna do with you?

29:15.296 --> 29:16.839
Talk to her? Be the go-between?

29:16.881 --> 29:18.507
It's a big mitzvah
to make a shidduch.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.469
-Let me see what I can do.
-Thanks, Miriam.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.138
Oh. (chuckles)

29:24.180 --> 29:25.931
-(squeals)
-Oh, look at you.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.058
-You're a dervish.
-Mr. Fuchtwanger.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.977
Back for another go-around
at Steiner, huh?

29:30.019 --> 29:31.437
What's the Steiner
Daily Newsletter

29:31.479 --> 29:32.897
without its resident
gossip columnist?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.773
-Mm.
-You ready? Blind item.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.942
-Hit me with it.
-What doyenne
of Brooklyn Heights

29:36.984 --> 29:39.528
still bears the scars
of recent breast augmentation?

29:39.570 --> 29:41.614
-No idea.
-Nellie Abromowitz.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.033
It was a blind item.
You weren't supposed to say.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.910
I'm such a bitch!

29:45.951 --> 29:47.953
Oh, been there, done that.
Sorry, Morty.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.372
Ooh, Marnie, you know
Feivish Feldstein, right?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.333
-A little.
-He likes you, a lot.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.002
-He never looks at me.
-He's young and shy

29:55.044 --> 29:56.921
and a little stupid,
but he's sweet,

29:56.962 --> 29:58.756
and he's pining for you,
and right now he's propped

29:58.797 --> 30:00.841
against a pillar pretending
not to stare at you.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.511
-Give him a shot?
-Here goes nothing.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.554
-(laughter, lively chatter)
-(dance music continues)

30:09.808 --> 30:12.561
(women whooping)

30:12.603 --> 30:14.688
Ooh, kiddo,
your palms really do get wet.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.357
Could you do me a favor,
Mrs. Maisel?

30:16.398 --> 30:18.526
Could you put in a good word
for me with your father?

30:18.567 --> 30:20.528
-I'll do what I can, Samuel.
-Just tell him

30:20.569 --> 30:22.196
that the scuff
on his suitcase was there

30:22.238 --> 30:23.781
before I picked it up, I swear.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.783
-I will.
-I checked it
against the miniatures.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.576
-I'll do what I can.
-Thank you, ma'am.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.286
Ooh, that makes me sound old.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.580
-Ooh, some pocketknife.
-Just heard you'd been banned

30:31.622 --> 30:33.082
from the swimsuit pageant,
Miriam.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.625
Word travels fast.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.169
Golly, I'm gonna miss seeing you
in your bikini.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.505
Time to go back
to Aunt Joan, Saul.

30:39.547 --> 30:40.923
(music ends)

30:40.965 --> 30:42.508

It's my Mamie Van Doren.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.734
You constantly astonish me.

34:28.776 --> 34:31.111
I repeat,
what are you doing here?

34:31.153 --> 34:33.113
Well, my star/only client
decides to go off

34:33.155 --> 34:34.990
and spend the fucking summer
up in the land

34:35.032 --> 34:36.325
of canoes and knishes,

34:36.366 --> 34:38.452
and I couldn't just
let things stop, so I came up

34:38.494 --> 34:40.037
to look for a gig
for you up here

34:40.078 --> 34:41.580
on the off chance-- (grunts)

34:41.622 --> 34:43.582
(coughs) I ate a bug.

34:43.624 --> 34:44.792
-Happens a lot.
-Ugh!

34:44.833 --> 34:46.251
It's in my throat.
It's still moving.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.921
Susie, I can't play gigs up
here, okay? Everybody knows me.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.756
(coughs) Don't worry, there's
hundreds of places up here.

34:50.798 --> 34:52.591
A lot of them are shit,
but some of them have

34:52.633 --> 34:54.176
pretty good rooms;
that's what I'm aiming for.

34:54.218 --> 34:56.428
But how would I do this?
I'm here on vacation.

34:56.470 --> 34:58.555
(rasps) You'll slip out,
just like you've been doing

34:58.597 --> 35:00.474
for most of the year--
no big deal.

35:00.516 --> 35:03.519
Oh. Well... you got any leads?

35:03.560 --> 35:05.771
(sighs) Friends at the
Stage Deli are lending a hand.

35:05.813 --> 35:07.815
It's not easy breaking through,
but I'm trying.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.191
-What is that?
-Ah.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.651
It's my ticket in, sister.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.444
My magic pass
to this godforsaken place.

35:12.486 --> 35:14.196
-How so?
-All I have to do is

35:14.238 --> 35:15.906
walk around holding this thing,
everyone thinks I work here.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.033
-It's genius.
-But how will you eat?

35:18.075 --> 35:20.077
-Where are you staying?
-Let me worry about that.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.162
You just wait for my call.
Be ready.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.081
-I'll be ready.
-And if I don't book you,

35:24.122 --> 35:25.541
at the very least,
I'll have made--

35:25.582 --> 35:27.835
Ugh! Shit!
I ate another bug.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.127
-Go get something to drink.
-Ah!

35:29.169 --> 35:30.546
It's mating with the other one.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.798
-Really, a little bit of water.
-God, I hate nature.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.387
-(dryers whirring)
-IDA: They never found the body.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.305
EDIE: They did too
find Glenn Miller's body.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.640
-IDA: No!
-Yeah!

35:41.682 --> 35:43.475
He was still holding
his trombone.

35:43.517 --> 35:44.977
(conversation continues quietly)

35:45.018 --> 35:46.895
IDA: Did you see that
Tony Curtis said that

35:46.937 --> 35:49.189
kissing Marilyn Monroe
was like kissing Hitler?

35:49.231 --> 35:50.858
Kissing Hitler?
How would Tony Curtis know

35:50.899 --> 35:52.234
what kissing Hitler was like?

35:52.276 --> 35:53.861
I don't know.
He said it, not me.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.153
He had such thin lips.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.905
-Tony Curtis?
-Adolf Hitler.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.490
His lips were almost
nonexistent.

35:58.532 --> 36:01.034
Maybe that's why he was
so angry, do you think?

36:01.076 --> 36:03.245
I don't like thinking
about that man; he was awful.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.163
Speaking of awful, did you see

36:05.205 --> 36:07.791
Gladys has a hair appointment
on Tuesday?

36:07.833 --> 36:10.210
But her husband's a weekender.
He won't be here till Friday.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.796
Oh? Who's she getting all
dolled up for if not for him?

36:12.838 --> 36:15.340
She's been playing
an awful lot of tennis lately.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.801
-The tennis pro?
-You said it, not me.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.429
I'm getting tired of people
hopping around from bed to bed.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.180
Tony Curtis, Gladys Lipschitz.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.099
Stay in one place.
It's exhausting.

36:24.141 --> 36:26.518
Oh, please. If my son
would just stay with a girl

36:26.560 --> 36:28.145
for more than two dates,
I'd plotz.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.106
-Benjamin?
-No one is good enough for him.

36:31.148 --> 36:35.485
Lovely girls from good families.
They cook. They're sweet as pie.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.946
They don't laugh too loud
or talk too loud.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.532
"They're too normal," he says.
"They're boring."

36:40.574 --> 36:41.825
Boring? What's that?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.493
All my friends
have grandchildren,

36:43.535 --> 36:46.288
and here I am with nothing
on the horizon.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.124
And he's such a catch.
A doctor, handsome.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.208
He's so handsome.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.919
But he says he wants
someone interesting,

36:51.960 --> 36:55.756
someone unique...
get this, someone weird.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.382
Weird!

36:57.424 --> 37:00.469
I've got the perfect girl
for him.

37:02.179 --> 37:05.265
Mink is the ultimate way
for your husband

37:05.307 --> 37:07.476
to say, "I love you."

37:07.517 --> 37:11.271
It's the most popular fur
and will last for years.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.565
Very durable.

37:13.607 --> 37:17.861
Raccoon fur is similar to mink
in that it's durable,

37:17.903 --> 37:22.449
and the color scheme is unique
and stands out in a crowd.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.452
Note this, ladies:
it is better to buy

37:25.494 --> 37:29.665
a luxurious raccoon
than a poor-quality mink.

37:29.706 --> 37:34.378
Now, let's talk about
coordinating muffs.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.755
Your grandmother
called them "mufflers,"

37:36.797 --> 37:40.509

your grandmother's muff.

(quietly):
He's an accomplished surgeon.

40:07.114 --> 40:09.574
Lenox Hill. First in his class
at Johns Hopkins.

40:09.616 --> 40:12.410
Had his choice of residencies
at any hospital he chose.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.412
He's already invented
new surgical techniques

40:14.454 --> 40:16.123
that have become
the worldwide standard,

40:16.164 --> 40:18.208
which is a remarkable feat
for such a young man.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.210
He's widely published
in medical journals.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.963
Now, I know he sounds
a little oddball

40:23.004 --> 40:24.798
on the surface,
but he's just eclectic.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.591
That's often a symbol
of accomplishment.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.594
John Quincy Adams
kept an alligator as a pet.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.638
And Benjamin Franklin
took naked air baths.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.181
Did you know that?

40:33.223 --> 40:35.267
I wonder if Ida's son
was named after him.

40:35.308 --> 40:38.019
Oh, that's his name, Benjamin.
Do you like the name Benjamin?

40:38.061 --> 40:39.396
He's never rented.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.273
He originally lived
in Sutton Place--

40:41.314 --> 40:42.941
had a beautiful view
of the bridge.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.860
But as close as it was
to his practice,

40:44.901 --> 40:46.695
he still found it to be too far.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.530
His patients
are everything to him,

40:48.572 --> 40:50.991
so he sold the place at a loss.
Can you imagine that?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.993
He bought a duplex
just a block from the hospital.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.828
It has views,
but not of the bridge.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.663
So they went out
about two hours ago?

40:56.705 --> 40:58.165
Yes, they do this every day.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.749
They swim,
they leave all their stuff.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.501
This is my sister's purse.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.211
She doesn't go anywhere
without her purse.

41:03.253 --> 41:05.088
Look, they could've swum
to another spot on the lake

41:05.130 --> 41:06.590
and are taking their time
to walk back.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.676
-Not without telling me.
-Or...

41:09.718 --> 41:12.095
Kyle, get to the office,
find Pauly, and fill him in.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.680
-We need boats on the water. Go!
-On it!

41:13.722 --> 41:15.432
Tell them to call
every resort on the lake

41:15.473 --> 41:17.434

This is a red flag alert.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.768
-(whistle blows)
-(people murmuring)

41:18.810 --> 41:20.437

I know, I know, you're not
the biggest opera fan.

41:22.564 --> 41:23.982
But the spectacle alone
is entertaining,

41:24.024 --> 41:25.775
so you should give it a chance.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.277
The sets are sensational.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.987
And, yes, sopranos
can be very annoying,

41:29.029 --> 41:30.530
but the orchestra is wonderful.

and throw her in the lake.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.165
Is she dead
before you tie her to the post,

42:22.207 --> 42:24.584
or do you tie her to the post
alive and dump her in like that?

42:24.626 --> 42:26.002
-She's alive.
-There'll be screaming.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.754
Not with the gag in her mouth.

42:27.796 --> 42:30.048
-You've thought this through.
-Stand. Start walking.

42:30.090 --> 42:32.259

my mother's mentioned you.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.386

to set us up for days,

see us doing something together.

-Not this boy.
-Pick up that oar.

43:52.589 --> 43:53.923
It was your idea
to get into a rowboat.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.884
-Pick up that oar.
-Really? That tone?

43:55.925 --> 43:57.886
I might as well be
rowing with my mother.

43:57.927 --> 43:59.763
Well, you could've
suggested something else.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.222
I'm just going along
for the ride here.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.433
I was perfectly happy playing
cribbage with the bubbes.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.435
-(laughter)
-(band playing lively music)

44:05.477 --> 44:07.479
It's getting sillier.

44:10.357 --> 44:13.151
-What is that?
-The Steiner Daily Newsletter.

44:13.193 --> 44:15.653
But we've got to at least
look like we're talking.

44:15.695 --> 44:17.655
-We are talking.
-You're reading.

44:17.697 --> 44:21.117
I am trying to stay informed,
and I am loving this new font.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.953
Well, read something and I'll
pretend that I'm enjoying it.

44:23.995 --> 44:27.165
"Arthur Rossman would like
to thank all the fellow guests

44:27.207 --> 44:29.667
who consoled him on the death
of his beloved dog Mogul."

44:29.709 --> 44:32.504
(laughs)

44:32.545 --> 44:34.130
You are sick.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.508
Well, read something light
that I can laugh at.

44:36.549 --> 44:37.884
"There will be
a twilight gathering

44:37.926 --> 44:39.260
of Holocaust survivors
tonight in..."

44:39.302 --> 44:41.429
Just shut up.

44:41.471 --> 44:44.099
This is going very well.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.273
You're supposed to row.

44:52.315 --> 44:53.817
-I know.
-I don't row.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.276
That's why you didn't
get very far.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.529
-I know.
-She never asked if I could row.

44:57.570 --> 45:00.323
Well, Benjamin, thank you for
the very, very little you did

45:00.365 --> 45:01.950
to get my mother off my back.

45:01.991 --> 45:04.619
-Don't mention it.
-Are you getting out?

45:04.661 --> 45:06.830
I'm quite comfortable here,
actually.

45:14.337 --> 45:16.673
SAMUEL:
I think the angle's fine, sir.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.675
ABE:
Almost, but not quite.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.885
Rotate it five degrees
counterclockwise.

45:20.927 --> 45:22.846
-Yes, sir.
-ROSE: What's that, Abe?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.264
My new drinking index.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.015
I blew some of
the timelines before,

45:26.057 --> 45:27.642
but this one is going to work.

45:27.684 --> 45:30.061
So ten degrees
is five degrees in your world?

45:30.103 --> 45:32.021
What world
do you live in, Jimmy?

45:32.063 --> 45:33.565
SAMUEL: But if it's close
enough, I can always

45:33.606 --> 45:35.608
help you reposition it
anytime during the fireworks.

45:35.650 --> 45:39.612
(sighs) And miss which fireworks
while we're doing that?

45:39.654 --> 45:42.866
The crackly dragon eggs?
The-the weeping willows?

45:42.907 --> 45:44.826
The gorgeous crescendo
of chrysanthemums?

45:44.868 --> 45:46.661
-Which ones?
-I'm sorry, I'll get it right.

45:46.703 --> 45:48.872
-With my help,
you'll get it right.
-Hello, Joel.

45:48.913 --> 45:51.332
Oh, hey. You joining us?
Got a spot on the blanket.

45:51.374 --> 45:54.169
Nah, I'm a little tired.
Probably just gonna turn in.

45:54.210 --> 45:56.588
-Your new room working out?
-Yeah, it's great.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.465
Again, thanks for letting me
stay like that, Rose.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.966
-It was really nice.
-No problem.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.551
Good night.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.303
ABE: Fold it up.
Let's just start over.

46:03.344 --> 46:04.512
We'll start over.
Get another blanket.

46:04.554 --> 46:05.722
All right.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.765
So, I saw you two
from the shore.

46:07.807 --> 46:09.642
Who? Me and Benjamin?

46:09.684 --> 46:11.644
-What happened?
-I did what I could.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.063
I mean, why in the world
wouldn't he pick up a damn oar?

46:14.105 --> 46:15.398
He just refused.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.774
-So rude.
-So rude.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.568
I must say, I was unimpressed.

46:18.610 --> 46:20.403
-How could you not be?
-Oof.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.863
ABE:
Ah, forget it.

46:23.865 --> 46:25.617
-(crickets chirping)
-(birds calling)

46:25.658 --> 46:27.619
(laughter, chatter)

46:27.660 --> 46:29.621
-Papa?
-Yes?

46:29.662 --> 46:31.164
You're snockered.

46:31.206 --> 46:33.249
-I'm fine.
-No, Abe, you're drunk.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.959
Your calculations
were off again.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.377
(slurring):
Give me another pickle.

46:36.419 --> 46:39.214
The brine in the pickle
counteracts the alcohol.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.090
You've had ten pickles, Abe.
Your pickles aren't working.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.884
-(laughs)
-Why are you laughing?

46:42.926 --> 46:44.511
'Cause it's funny.

46:44.552 --> 46:46.387
I'm having my lawyer contact
the chief counsel

46:46.429 --> 46:47.680
at Claussen Pickles.

46:47.722 --> 46:49.516
There will be a lawsuit.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.059
(both laugh)

46:51.100 --> 46:52.977
-Are you both laughing?
-No.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.521
That should be not laughing.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.314
-(fireworks whistling, popping)
-(crowd gasping)

46:56.356 --> 46:59.067
Oh, Abe, you're missing
the fireworks.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.402
Oh, just describe them to me.

47:01.444 --> 47:05.031
MIDGE: Well, there was, like,
a big display of flowers,

47:05.073 --> 47:08.535
multicolored,
and they danced across the sky.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.537
Ah, that's a chrysanthemum.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.456
I love the chrysanthemums.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.666
(both laugh)

47:14.707 --> 47:17.460
And now there's another
sparkly thing going off.

47:17.502 --> 47:19.128
-(both laugh)
-Oh.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.714
Oh...

47:55.164 --> 47:57.166
Sure.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.052
Thanks.

48:10.555 --> 48:13.182
Not in a sociable mood
tonight, huh?

48:13.224 --> 48:15.768
-Guess not.
-Me, neither.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.148
I've never really
understood fireworks.

48:20.189 --> 48:22.984
We used to love them.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.612
I mean, I did.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.405
Now they're just...

48:27.447 --> 48:30.491
-Lights in the sky.
-Lights in the sky.

48:35.371 --> 48:38.958
You think...

48:39.000 --> 48:41.377
What?

48:41.419 --> 48:43.504
You think we're ever
really forgiven

48:43.546 --> 48:45.840
for the mistakes we've made?

48:45.882 --> 48:48.384
Who do you want
doing the forgiving? God?

48:48.426 --> 48:50.094
People.

48:50.136 --> 48:52.138
People never forgive.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.765
Not in my experience.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.850
They say they do,
but they don't.

48:55.892 --> 48:58.394
I'm not even sure
forgiveness really matters.

48:58.436 --> 48:59.896
Why wouldn't it matter?

48:59.937 --> 49:01.814
Well, what is it, forgiveness?

49:01.856 --> 49:03.274
It doesn't mean anything.

49:03.316 --> 49:05.234
I mean, you still did
what you did, right?

49:05.276 --> 49:06.527
Nothing's changed.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.404
Forgiveness is a mindset.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.782
Synapses in your brain
telling you to think differently

49:10.823 --> 49:12.367
about something
that's already happened.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.035
It's amorphous.
It's not really there.

49:14.077 --> 49:17.997
And if it's not really there,
what is it?

49:19.624 --> 49:22.043
God, I hope that's not true.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.507
Every day, I feel like
I'm getting kicked

49:27.548 --> 49:29.717
in the head a little.

49:29.759 --> 49:34.013
I know I deserve it, but I sure
would like it to end someday.

49:34.055 --> 49:37.016
Just do what I do,
stay away from people.

49:37.058 --> 49:40.186
If you're not around them, there
are no mistakes to be made.

49:40.228 --> 49:43.272
That's not the answer.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.024
You know that.

49:45.066 --> 49:46.651
You need people.

49:46.693 --> 49:49.278
To bum a light.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.031
That's about it, though.

49:52.073 --> 49:54.742
Nah.

49:54.784 --> 49:57.495
You'll change your mind someday.

49:57.537 --> 49:59.539
Just wait.

49:59.580 --> 50:02.375
You'll see.
