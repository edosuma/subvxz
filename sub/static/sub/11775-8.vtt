WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:08.242
,
( theme music playing )

00:32.300 --> 00:33.434
HEY!

00:33.534 --> 00:35.636
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M STANDING HERE.

00:35.736 --> 00:36.870
I WAS HERE FIRST.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.406
I DON'T CARE.
I'M GETTING THE CAB.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.041
- WHAT, YOU UPSTREAM ME?
- EVERYBODY UPSTREAMS,
YOU IDIOT.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.043
YOU DON'T STAND THERE
LIKE A JACKASS.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.845
THAT'S ANARCHY.
WE NEED SOME RULES.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.647
WHATEVER.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.422
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.625
YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT,
YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT,
YOU GOT IT.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.594
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL DO 30 SECONDS AND
ONE MORE-- THE LAST ONE.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.131
- WHAT?
THIS WAS "ONE MORE."
- NO, THE LAST ONE.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.998
YOU SAID ONE MORE;
I DID ONE MORE.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.368
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER?
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE MORE--

01:07.468 --> 01:09.103
- THE SHOULDER
FEELS GOOD, I SWEAR.
- GREAT.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.938
- GREAT JOB.
YOU'RE FANTASTIC.
- THANK YOU.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.274
- TOMORROW?
- TOMORROW 2:00,
SAME TIME.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.276
- BEAUTIFUL.
- FIST-BUMP ME OUT.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.877
- YEAH, OKAY.
- NICE. SEE YA.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.546
- SEE YA. THANKS.
- YEAH.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.652
BOY OH BOY, MY SHOULDER
FEELS FANTASTIC.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.853
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:25.953 --> 01:28.189
THIS NEW TRAINER
COMPLETELY CURED ME.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.159
HE MASSAGES IT.
HE GIVES YOU EXERCISES
FOR IT.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.161
I DON'T LIKE TRAINERS,
NOT INTO THEM.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.396
I DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD
WHAT TO DO.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.665
YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY YOU MARRIED SUSIE?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.133
YES, THAT'S--

01:39.233 --> 01:40.534
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.102
ALL RIGHT, I GOT THE POINT.
I GOT THE POINT.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.004
NO WONDER WHY YOU DON'T LIKE
BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.807
WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS
I DON'T LIKE TRAINERS 'CAUSE
I DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE...

01:46.907 --> 01:49.710
- YOU DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE
TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.346
I STINK.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.947
WE REALLY GOTTA
GET GOING, MAN.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.316
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU TAKING ME?

01:55.416 --> 01:57.618
I'M TAKING YOU
TO AN INVENTOR.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.119
WHAT DO THEY INVENT?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.721
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S INVENTED

02:00.821 --> 02:02.490
OR WHAT
HE'S ABOUT TO INVENT
OR WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.458
SO WHAT, HE'S PITCHING US
HIS INVENTIONS?

02:04.558 --> 02:07.195
MY COUSIN, ALL HIS FRIENDS
SAY THIS GUY IS BRILLIANT.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.029
- I'M AN INVENTOR.
- YOU'RE NOT AN INVENTOR.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.331
I HAVE A MILLION IDEAS
FOR THINGS.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.032
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE AN INVENTOR.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.368
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT.
- WHAT HAVE YOU INVENTED?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.237
A SKI THAT COMES
IN TWO PIECES.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.639
YOU SCREW IT ON, OKAY?
LIKE A POOL CUE.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.642
- WAIT A MINUTE.
A SKI THAT YOU SCREW ON?
- A SKI, YES YES.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.144
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CARRY THESE BIG GIANT
SKIS AROUND.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.715
- WHERE DO I BUY THAT?
- LIKE I SAID, I NEED
THE IMPLEMENTER.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.116
OKAY, YOU'RE AN IDEA MAN.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.018
GO WITH ME ON THAT ONE.
YOU'RE AN IDEA MAN.

02:31.118 --> 02:34.087
I'M AN IDEA MAN WHO COMES UP
WITH INVENTIONS.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.257
NO, THERE ARE NO INVENTIONS
IN YOUR WORLD.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.591
( chuckles )
WELL, THAT'S AN INVENTION.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.428
THE SKI THAT COMES
IN TWO PIECES IS AN INVENTION.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.796
- THAT'S AN INVENTION.
- IF YOU IMPLEMENT IT.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.500
WELL, WE HAVE
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
ON IMPLEMENTATION.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.168
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.303
LITERALLY
A COUPLE MORE BALLS

02:49.403 --> 02:51.705
AND THEN WE GOTTA GO
TO THE INVENTOR.

02:51.805 --> 02:55.509
- Jeff: THERE WE GO.
- THIS IS WHERE I LOST MY
VIRGINITY-- ON THIS BLOCK.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.346
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- YEAH, GREAT JONES
AND LAFAYETTE.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.914
- YOU DID NOT. YOU'RE LYING.
- YEAH, RIGHT IN THAT
BUILDING OVER THERE.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.517
- SHUT UP. YOU DID NOT.
- YES, SUSAN FLESCHNER,
SWEAR TO GOD.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.819
- SUSAN FLESCHNER?
- YEAH, RIGHT IN THAT
BUILDING.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.489
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- I KNOW.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.791
THE MIRRORS, WHICH ARE
AT A 45Â° ANGLE--

03:10.891 --> 03:13.327
THERE'S A MIRROR ON THE BOTTOM
AND A MIRROR ON THE TOP, RIGHT?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.329
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
AND YOU JUST--

03:15.429 --> 03:17.130
YOU PUSH A BUTTON IN THE CAR
AND IT COMES RIGHT UP.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.067
- A CAR PERISCOPE.
THAT'S GREAT.
- A CAR PERISCOPE, EXACTLY.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.369
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.337
I'VE ACTUALLY
THOUGHT OF THAT.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.539
I SWEAR.
I'VE BEEN IN CARS

03:25.639 --> 03:27.741
AND I WANTED-- YOU KNOW,
I'M STUCK IN TRAFFIC

03:27.841 --> 03:30.077
AND I'M THINKING
THERE SHOULD BE
A PERISCOPE.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.445
YOU THOUGHT OF--
YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF--

03:31.545 --> 03:33.814
YEAH, I HONESTLY DID.
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.849
- BUT YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THE IDEA.
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.553
ANYWAY, SO WHAT I DID WAS,
I HAVE A CRUDE PROTOTYPE,
RIGHT,

03:39.653 --> 03:42.423
I MEAN, KIND OF LIKE THIS
THAT I'D MOUNTED IN
MY OWN VOLVO.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.525
I MEAN, I'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO TEST-DRIVE IT.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.728
BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING
TO RAISE MONEY FOR
IS THIS.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.031
HERE WE HAVE
A FULLY ARTICULATED
ANTENNA, OKAY?

03:51.131 --> 03:53.701
IT'S LOCKED UP INTO THE CAR.
YOU PUSH A BUTTON
ON THE DASHBOARD.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.736
IT COMES UP.
THEN A CAMERA AT THE TOP

03:55.836 --> 03:58.138
SENDS A LIVE
IMAGE TO A SCREEN,
ONTO THE DASHBOARD,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.541
JUST LIKE IF YOU PUT
THE CAR IN REVERSE--
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THAT PICTURE.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.510
- FANTASTIC.
- AND LET ME ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION:

04:02.610 --> 04:04.144
- YES, SURE.
- CAN YOU SEE OVER S.U.V.s?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.680
OF COURSE.
THIS PERISCOPE

04:06.780 --> 04:09.417
IS GOING TO BE
ON EVERY SINGLE CAR
IN THE WORLD.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.385
EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE
WHERE THE TRAFFIC IS.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.321
EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON
AHEAD OF THEM.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.489
REMEMBER THESE?

04:15.589 --> 04:18.158
DO YOU KNOW A KID ONCE
STABBED ME IN CLASS?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.527
- THESE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS.
- GUESS WHAT:

04:19.627 --> 04:21.362
WITH THE PENCIL SIDE,
THANK GOD.
THAT SIDE--

04:21.462 --> 04:23.096
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
LOOKING AT YOUR INVENTION.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD MAKE CIRCLES
FOR, LIKE, FOUR HOURS.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.168
- REALLY?
- I LOVE THESE SO MUCH, YES.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.505
- THE PERFECT CIRCLE.
THE PERFECT CIRCLE, COME ON.
- COMPASS.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.674
SO THAT'S--
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.209
- HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA
FOR SOMETHING.
- YEAH?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.778
YOU KNOW,
WHEN PEOPLE GO SKIING,

04:37.878 --> 04:40.113
- THE SKI'S, LIKE,
REALLY LONG, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

04:40.213 --> 04:44.284
I'M THINKING LIKE A SKI
THAT YOU SCREW IN
LIKE A POOL CUE

04:44.385 --> 04:45.953
SO IT'S EASY TO CARRY.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.555
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:47.655 --> 04:50.057
- WELL, IT'S AN IDEA.
IT'S AN IDEA.
- YEAH.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.225
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
AN INVENTION.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.227
WHERE DO WE COME IN
ON THIS?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.364
WELL, SO WHAT I'M
LOOKING FOR IS $250,000.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.499
- $250,000?
- SEED MONEY.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.300
- THAT'S BASICALLY IT.
- ( phone ringing )

05:00.401 --> 05:02.235
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.872
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.442
YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY--
I MEAN, I LIKE IT, BUT...

05:08.542 --> 05:11.579
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
BUT REALLY WHO IS THIS GUY?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.614
WHY SHOULD WE
TRUST HIM?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.684
THIS COULD BE A BIG,
ELABORATE CON GAME
FOR ALL WE KNOW.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.486
YOU THINK IT COULD BE
A CON GAME?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.554
YOU KNOW,
LOOK AT "THE STING."
THAT'S ELABORATE.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.491
I NEVER SAW IT.
I SAW "THE STING II."

05:23.591 --> 05:25.693
YOU DIDN'T SEE
"THE STING"?

05:25.793 --> 05:28.996
- NO, BUT "THE STING II,"
JACKIE GLEASON-- PRETTY GOOD.
- YOU SAW "THE STING II"?

05:29.096 --> 05:32.032
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT
SEES "STING II"
AND NOT "STING I"?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.435
I DON'T REMEMBER BACK THEN,
BUT I'M JUST TELLING YOU

05:34.535 --> 05:36.269
I DIDN'T SEE "STING I."
I SAW "STING II."

05:36.370 --> 05:38.138
YOU MUST BE THE ONLY
PERSON IN THE WORLD

05:38.238 --> 05:40.107
WHO SAW "STING II"
AND NOT "STING I."

05:40.207 --> 05:42.510
- AND DIDN'T SEE "STING I"?
- YEAH, I WOULD BET
THAT YOU ARE.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.512
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, HERE'S
WHAT WE'LL TELL HIM:

05:44.612 --> 05:45.879
"WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT."

05:45.979 --> 05:49.282
- IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
- IT IS, I GOTTA SAY.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.951
- HEY.
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:51.051 --> 05:54.054
- WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
- YEAH YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
THINK ABOUT IT.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.890
A LITTLE BIT OF INVESTMENT
IS GONNA GO A LONG WAY.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.826
- SOUNDS EXCITING.
- IT'S A VERY EXCITING
PROJECT.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.328
- THANK YOU.
- I'M VERY-- I'M REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.163
- THANKS.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YES, SAME.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.566
- ( sniffles ) HI.
- HI.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.468
- GABY.
- HI GABY. JEFF.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.503
- JEFF, HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI. LARRY.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.838
- LARRY, HI.
- HI.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.474
OH, I'M IRA'S WIFE.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.443
- Jeff: OH, OKAY OKAY.
- ( Gaby chuckles )

06:15.543 --> 06:18.045
- DID YOU GUYS LIKE
THE INVENTION?
- SURE, YES.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.513
- HEY HONEY.
- HI BABY.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.482
YES? GOOD GOOD.
THANK YOU.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.418
- VERY CLEVER.
- YEAH, ISN'T IT SO COOL?
HE IS SO TALENTED.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.120
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
BE THINKING ABOUT IT.
WE'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.590
- OKAY, SOUNDS GREAT.
- I THINK WE CAN MAKE A LOT
OF MONEY WITH IT TOO.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.125
- I HOPE SO.
NICE MEETING YOU. TAKE CARE.
- OKAY, TAKE CARE.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.260
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.463
THANK YOU.
BYE.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.999
- Ira: NICE JOB.
- THEY'RE SWEET, RIGHT?

06:40.534 --> 06:44.304
OKAY, CAN I
TELL YOU SOMETHING?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.808
ANY QUESTIONS I HAD
ABOUT THIS GUY

06:47.908 --> 06:49.477
WERE JUST ANSWERED.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.644
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.646
HE'S SMART.
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.616
HE CAN HAVE ANYBODY.
HE CHOSE HER.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.150
THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.786
THIS GUY'S GOT
INTEGRITY.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.488
I TRUST HIM NOW.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.922
- I TRUST HIM COMPLETELY.
- I TRUST HIM.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.691
- YOU TRUST HIM TOO?
- I DO, ABSOLUTELY.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.894
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE NEED TO TEST-DRIVE
IT THOUGH.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.630
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TELL HIM.
- WE GOTTA TEST THE PROTOTYPE.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.201
Susie:
YOU TWO ARE
A COUPLE OF SCHMUCKS,

07:14.301 --> 07:15.869
- YOU KNOW THAT?
- Jeff: WHAT?

07:15.969 --> 07:18.639
THIS LOOKS LIKE
AN EIGHTH-GRADE
SCIENCE EXPERIMENT,

07:18.739 --> 07:21.108
THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.176
- IT'S NOT WHAT IT'S GONNA BE.
- WHAT IS IT GONNA BE?

07:23.276 --> 07:26.480
NO, THERE'S GONNA
BE AN ANTENNA WITH
A CAMERA ATTACHED

07:26.580 --> 07:28.516
AND YOU'LL SEE IT
ON THE SCREEN
IN THE FRONT.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.917
YEAH, AND HOW MUCH MONEY
IS THAT GONNA COST?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.985
I DON'T KNOW.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.386
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.623
OH, WE'RE NEVER GONNA
GET TO THE PARTY.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.691
LOOK AT THIS--
STANDSTILL TRAFFIC.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.927
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
WHAT'S CAUSING THIS?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.929
OH HEY.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.230
OH!

07:43.330 --> 07:46.800
( car horns honking )

07:46.900 --> 07:49.402
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.
- WHAT?

07:49.503 --> 07:51.404
WE'VE GOT A GARBAGE TRUCK
AT 12:00.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.273
YOU GO TO YOUR LEFT.
GO TO YOUR LEFT.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.842
- WHAT, SERIOUSLY?
- REALLY?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.544
- GO TO YOUR LEFT!
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.579
- Susie: YOU REALLY
SEE SOMETHING?
- YEAH.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.581
- Jeff and Larry: OH!
- Susie: OH MY GOD!

08:00.681 --> 08:02.983
- Larry: LOOK AT THIS!
- Jeff: YEAH!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.452
I SEE THE GARBAGE TRUCK.
UNBELIEVABLE. WOW.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.888
- WE'RE MOVING.
- YEAH!

08:07.988 --> 08:09.456
I'M WILLING TO ADMIT
I'M WRONG.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.091
THIS MIGHT REALLY BE
A REAL THING.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.161
THAT WAS
UNBELIEVABLE.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.367
IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE

IT'S LIKE A TREAT.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.904
- THANK YOU.
- YOU KNOW, WANDA'S PLACE
IN L.A. IS HAUNTED.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.840
- THAT'S WHY SHE'S OUT HERE.
- OH, STOP IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:26.940 --> 08:30.644
NO NO, I'M HERE BECAUSE
L.A. WAS HAUNTED.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.581
BUT NOW NEW YORK
IS HAUNTED.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.349
- WHY? 'CAUSE HE'S HERE?
RIGHT? I KNOW.
- YEAH YEAH.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.585
AND YOU LOOK FANTASTIC,
BY THE WAY.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.986
- THANK YOU.
- FANTASTIC.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.453
- LARRY, CAN I SAY
SOMETHING?
- WHAT?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.289
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TOO.
- THANK YOU, JEFF.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.826
- NO, REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
- I GOT THIS FANTASTIC
TRAINER-- TERRY.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.061
I COULDN'T EVEN HOLD
A GLASS A FEW WEEKS AGO
'CAUSE OF MY ELBOW.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.330
HE FIXED MY ELBOW.
HE FIXED MY SHOULDER.
THE GUY'S GREAT.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.734
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.
WHY DON'T YOU SEND ME
HIS INFORMATION?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.803
- HE'S GONNA
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.771
YOU KNOW, LIFE THAT
SORELY NEEDS CHANGING.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.941
- OH, STOP IT.
- WELL, EMAIL ME
HIS INFORMATION.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.610
I WILL.
I WILL EMAIL IT TO YOU.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.178
I'M STILL AT THE SAME
EMAIL-- IHATELARRY.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.214
- YEAH.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.782
I'M GONNA GO MINGLE.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.517
- WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU MINGLE.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.519
WELL, THAT'D BE A NICE
THING FOR YOU TO DO.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.387
I HAPPEN TO BE
IN TOP PHYSICAL SHAPE.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.924
( laughs )
TOP PHYSICAL SHAPE?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.391
- YES, I AM.
- AS COMPARED TO WHAT?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.260
- HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING?
- Susie: HEY. HI.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.030
- HEY, HENRY,
HOW ARE YOU DOING, PAL?
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, JEFF?

09:23.130 --> 09:25.599
- WHAT AN APARTMENT.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SPACE.
- Jeff: OH, BEAUTIFUL.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.567
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- HI HENRY.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.803
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, LARRY?
- GOOD. HOW'S YOUR DAD,
BY THE WAY?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.805
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE'S GETTING UP THERE.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.607
- HE'S IN HIS MID-'80s.
- Susie: UH-HUH.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.376
- AND HE'S GOT GOOD DAYS
AND BAD DAYS.
- MM-HMM.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.045
I ACTUALLY
MOVED HIM IN WITH ME.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.813
- REALLY?
- WOW.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.482
- YEAH, HE LIVES HERE,
IN THE BACK BEDROOM THERE.
- OH, WOW.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.951
- YOU KNOW WHO
HIS DAD IS, RIGHT?
- NO.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.119
- JUDGE HORN.
- YOUR DAD'S JUDGE HORN?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.288
- JUDGE CARTER HORN.
- OH MY GOD, I LOVE
JUDGE HORN.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.924
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW.
I USED TO RACE HOME
TO WATCH THAT.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.993
- OH MY GOD.
- THANK YOU.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.496
I WOULD LAUGH FOR HOURS
ABOUT HIM SCREAMING
AT THE DEFENDANTS--

09:56.596 --> 09:58.899
"YOU'RE NOT PREPARED,
YOUNG LADY!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.333
WHERE ARE
THE PICTURES?"

10:00.433 --> 10:03.303
JUDGE HORN, WOW.
THAT IS SOMETHING.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.272
YEAH. ANYWAY, THANKS
FOR STOPPING BY.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.374
- THANKS FOR HAVING US, MAN.
- YOU GUYS HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.442
- YEAH, WE'RE ALL GOOD.
- I'M GONNA MINGLE
A LITTLE BIT.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.244
- I'LL CIRCLE AROUND.
- GO MINGLE.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.847
- JUDGE HORN, HUH?
- I LOVED HIM-- LOVED HIM.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.651
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD GO SAY HELLO
TO HIM, SHOULDN'T I?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.186
YEAH, THAT WOULD
BE NICE.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.388
I ALWAYS THINK
OF NICE THINGS

10:21.488 --> 10:23.456
BUT I NEVER ACT ON THEM.
WHAT IS THAT?

10:23.556 --> 10:25.659
IT'S LIKE YOU
WITH INVENTIONS:

10:25.759 --> 10:27.027
YOU THINK OF INVENTIONS;
YOU NEVER DO THE INVENTIONS.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
- I DON'T IMPLEMENT.
- YEAH.

10:29.196 --> 10:32.132
I COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW.
BY GOD, I'M GONNA GO INTO
THAT ROOM AND DO IT.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.400
- OKAY.
- GO.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.837
I AM GOING TO DO
SOMETHING NICE

10:36.937 --> 10:38.706
- RIGHT NOW.
- YOU DON'T NEED
NO IMPLEMENTER. GO.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.874
- I'M GOING.
I'M DOING IT.
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.542
HE HAS TO ANNOUNCE IT.
HE CAN'T JUST DO
SOMETHING NICE.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.544
- OH, SHUT UP.
- HE HAS TO ANNOUNCE IT.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.246
"WOMAN."

10:46.346 --> 10:47.614
DOUBLE LETTERS GO
FOR THE "W."

10:47.715 --> 10:51.584
EIGHT, NINE, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, TIMES THREE-- 42.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.320
HEY.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.922
JUDGE HORN.

10:55.022 --> 10:55.856
YEAH.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.391
LARRY--
LARRY DAVID.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.559
- HI LARRY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.228
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, HEY.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
- WHAT DO I DO?
- YEAH, WHICHEVER YOU WANT.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.698
THERE YOU GO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.433
- THAT'S A TOUGH
DECISION FOR ME.
- ( chuckles )

11:06.533 --> 11:08.869
- RIGHT?
- YEAH, I SEE PEOPLE
STRUGGLE WITH IT EVERY DAY.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.104
PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED
WHEN THEY SHAKE HANDS--
LEFTY, RIGHTY.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.572
WHAT, RIGHTY--
YOU GO BACKHAND, RIGHT?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.041
- GO UP NORMAL--
- THEY GO LIKE THAT.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.176
- RIGHT, AND THEN I HAVE
TO GO LIKE THAT.
- YEAH YEAH.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.979
SOMETIMES I WISH I HAD
ONE ARM WHEN I'M CUDDLING
IN BED WITH A WOMAN,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.948
'CAUSE THE OTHER ARM
GETS IN THE WAY
ALL THE TIME,

11:21.048 --> 11:22.783
SO, YOU KNOW,
COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE

11:22.883 --> 11:25.018
IN THAT SITUATION.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.386
YEAH YEAH.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.988
HEY, COULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR, LARRY?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.690
I GOT SOMETHING TO DO.
AND HE'S A PLEASURE
TO PLAY WITH.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.326
SO WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND TAKE MY PLACE?
I APPRECIATE IT, LARRY.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.095
- WHAT?
- THANK YOU.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.564
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL PLAY A LITTLE SCRABBLE.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.199
YEAH.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.101
MY FATHER WAS A HUGE
HUGE FAN OF YOURS.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.535
HE USED TO WATCH YOU
ALL THE TIME.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.371
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.507
A LOT OF KIKES
LIKED THE SHOW,

11:47.607 --> 11:49.309
JIGABOOS TOO.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.981
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU NOT GONNA PLAY?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.549
- ARE YOU GONNA CHEAT ME TOO?
- HEY, DAD, DAD, EASY.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.119
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.259
- 217 TO 67?
- WHAT? OH, I--

12:06.359 --> 12:08.328
- CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE
FOR A SECOND, LARRY?
- YEAH, BUT I WASN'T--

12:08.428 --> 12:10.130
MAY I TALK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.833
WHAT A GREAT PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.734
OUTSIDE THE ROOM.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.675
WHAT ARE YOU DO--
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

12:22.776 --> 12:24.044
DO WHAT?

12:24.144 --> 12:27.714
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF MY FATHER AT SCRABBLE?

12:27.815 --> 12:30.017
I DIDN'T PLAY HIM.
I WASN'T PLAYING HIM.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.052
- YOU WEREN'T PLAYING HIM?
- NO, I--

12:32.152 --> 12:34.254
- WHO ELSE WAS THERE, LARRY?
- I TOOK OVER FOR
A ONE-ARMED MAN.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.889
THERE WAS A ONE-ARMED MAN
PLAYING HIM.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.391
A ONE--
A ONE-ARMED MAN?

12:38.491 --> 12:41.862
YES, HE HAD A WORK UNIFORM
LIKE HE WAS FIXING
AN AIR CONDITIONER.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.597
LARRY, LARRY,
I'M HAVING A PARTY.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.699
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MAINTENANCE PEOPLE
UP HERE DOING WORK.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.701
EXCUSE ME, DID YOU SEE
A ONE-ARMED MAN?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.471
NO. A ONE-ARMED MAN?
NO.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.640
DID ANYBODY SEE--
DID ANYBODY SEE
A ONE-ARMED MAN?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.009
THERE WAS
A ONE-ARMED MAN HERE.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.377
LARRY, THERE'S NO
ONE-ARMED MAN.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.113
LOOK, YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF MY FATHER, OKAY?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.782
AND THEN NOW YOU'RE
COMING UP WITH SOME
FICTITIOUS PERSON

13:02.883 --> 13:04.151
- WHO DID IT INSTEAD.
- OH, YOUR FATHER.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.220
OH, POOR POOR SWEET,
INNOCENT DAD.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.523
YOU SHOULD HEAR
SOME OF THE RACIAL EPITHETS
THIS GUY WAS USING IN THERE.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.459
- IT'S DISGUSTING.
- MY FATHER HAS
DEMENTIA, LARRY.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.194
- OH, THAT'S AN EXCUSE?
- YES.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.763
THAT RACISM IS
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
IT'S LIKE A DRUNK--

13:16.864 --> 13:19.632
WHAT, THEY'RE SAYING THESE
THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE DRUNK?
NO, IT'S IN THERE.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.002
LARRY, I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN
TO THIS ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

13:22.102 --> 13:25.238
YOU ABUSE
MY FATHER IN SCRABBLE--
A GAME HE LOVES, OKAY?

13:25.338 --> 13:28.408
I DIDN'T BEAT HIM.
THE ONE-ARMED MAN DID IT.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.577
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO LEAVE, LARRY.
- FINE.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.445
- BECAUSE I'M GETTING
REALLY UPSET HERE.
- FINE, I'M LEAVING.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.781
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA FIND THAT
ONE-ARMED MAN

13:34.882 --> 13:36.716
AND I'M GONNA
BRING HIM TO YOU.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
YOU'LL SEE.
YOU'LL SEE.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.689
SO A ONE-ARMED MAN

13:42.789 --> 13:44.691
PLAYING SCRABBLE
WITH A RACIST JUDGE?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.393
WHAT DID HE SAY
THAT WAS SO RACIST?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.695
- I CAN'T EVEN REPEAT IT--
DISGUSTING.
- REALLY?

13:48.795 --> 13:51.064
SO I TOLD HENRY
AND HE SAYS,
"NO NO, HE'S GOT DEMENTIA.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.000
IT'S NOT RACISM.
IT'S DEMENTIA."

13:53.100 --> 13:55.002
ALL RIGHT, NOW GET TO
YOUR LEFT A LITTLE BIT.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.937
YEAH, HENRY'S USING
THE DEMENTIA

13:57.037 --> 13:58.872
AS AN EXCUSE
FOR THE RACISM.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.341
- THERE'S A FINE LINE THERE.
- DEMENTIA HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH RACISM.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.576
I KNOW. MY GRANDFATHER
HAD DEMENTIA.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.512
HE WASN'T A RACIST.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.148
HE THOUGHT
I WAS HIS DEAD SISTER,
BUT HE WASN'T A RACIST.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.283
DID YOU LOOK LIKE
YOUR GREAT-AUNT?

14:10.383 --> 14:12.152
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY DID.
- REALLY?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.922
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I LOOKED EXACTLY--

14:15.022 --> 14:16.456
- ( laughing )
- I LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE HER.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.292
SHE WAS
THE BELLE OF BRIGHTON.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.431
THIS THING IS SO GREAT.
I MEAN, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.167
THREE BLOCKS AHEAD I SEE
WE'RE HEADING FOR TROUBLE.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.769
THREE BLOCKS AHEAD
THERE'S A GUY
WITH HIS TRUCK.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.072
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.376
OH MY-- JEFF,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.278
IT'S THE ONE-ARMED MAN.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.747
HE'S CROSSING THE STREET.
CHECK IT OUT.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.416
I SEE ONE ARM.
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT
ONE-ARMED MAN?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.153
- THAT'S HIM.
- OKAY, HE'S GOING DOWN
THE STREET OVER THERE.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.122
I WANT
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.024
STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.892
- STAY TO YOUR RIGHT.
- OKAY.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.364
DAMN IT, WHERE IS HE?

14:57.464 --> 14:58.999
RIGHT DOWN THERE!

14:59.099 --> 15:00.800
I CAN'T TURN
DOWN THAT BLOCK.
IT'S ONE-WAY.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.169
ALL RIGHT, GO DOWN.
WE'LL MAKE A RIGHT.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.437
WE'LL HEAD HIM OFF
AT THE PASS.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.342
- ( tires screech )
- Jeff: GO GO GO.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.311
( honks horn )

15:11.411 --> 15:12.712
ALL RIGHT, MAKE A RIGHT.
MAKE A RIGHT.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.247
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.217
BEAUTIFUL!
LOOK AT THAT-- BEAUTIFUL.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.685
SO HE SHOULD BE
ANYWHERE UP HERE.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.120
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE BLOCK.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.488
- ANYWHERE UP HERE.
- WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

15:21.588 --> 15:24.024
- Jeff: LOOK OUT!
- ( tires screech )

15:27.427 --> 15:29.362
IT'S HIM!
HEY!

15:29.462 --> 15:31.131
WAIT, HEY!

15:31.231 --> 15:32.665
HE WENT DOWN
TO THE SUBWAY.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.701
SHIT.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.270
THAT WAS HIM.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.909
( phone ringing )

15:43.010 --> 15:45.678
SORRY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
HELLO.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.916
- HEY, IT'S TERRY.
HOW'S IT GOING?
- OH, HEY TERRY.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.685
LISTEN, I'M SORRY TO DO THIS,
BUT I GOTTA CANCEL
TODAY'S 2:00.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.256
OH. OKAY, FINE.
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 2:00.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.258
I DON'T HAVE MY BOOK
IN FRONT OF ME,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.227
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.395
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WORK SOMETHING OUT?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.565
I HAVE A 2:00.
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT ARE WE WORKING OUT?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.235
LISTEN, I'M SPOTTING
SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW
AT THE GYM.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.137
I GOTTA RUN.
TAKE CARE. BYE.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.773
LARRY, AS YOUR
BUSINESS MANAGER,

16:13.873 --> 16:16.876
I CANNOT ADVOCATE
YOU PUTTING YOUR MONEY
INTO THIS.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.413
AN AUTOMOBILE PERISCOPE--
IT'S NUTTY.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.216
I DON'T LIKE MY CLIENTS
TO INVEST IN INVENTIONS.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.086
I HAD A CLIENT--
HE THREW AWAY MILLIONS

16:26.186 --> 16:28.588
ON A TWO-PART SKI
THAT WOULD COME TOGETHER
LIKE A POOL CUE.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.258
- WHAT?
- MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HE LOST
ON A NUTTY IDEA LIKE THAT.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.826
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THAT'S MY IDEA.
I HAD THAT IDEA.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.462
PEOPLE'S LEGS
WOULD SNAP LIKE THAT.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.797
I DON'T THINK SO.
THEY COULD PERFECT THAT.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.200
AND YOU'D BE CARRYING IT
LIKE A POOL CUE.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.968
I MEAN, I LOVE
YOUR EXUBERANCE

16:42.069 --> 16:43.436
AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM
FOR INVENTIONS,

16:43.536 --> 16:45.638
BUT IT SHOWS
THAT IN THIS AREA

16:45.738 --> 16:47.107
YOUR JUDGMENT
IS NOT GOOD.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.142
ALL RIGHT, CAN I
TELL YOU SOMETHING?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.644
I BELIEVE
IN THIS INVENTOR.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.346
WHY?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.482
HAVE YOU DONE
A BACKGROUND CHECK?
I MEAN, INVENTORS--

16:55.582 --> 16:59.152
- HE HAS--
HE HAS CHARACTER.
- ( phone rings )

16:59.252 --> 17:01.188
- I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.
- I'M SORRY.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.156
YEAH, SEND HER IN, SURE.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.358
- IS IT OKAY IF MY WIFE
COMES IN FOR A MOMENT?
- SURE.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.695
- HI HONEY.
HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. GOOD.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.331
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
- BRITNEY, THIS IS LARRY.
LARRY-- BRITNEY.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.333
LARRY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M JUST COMING BY

17:13.433 --> 17:15.502
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE
OKAY FOR THE HAMPTONS.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.004
- ALL GOOD.
- 4:00, THE CAR WILL BE
DOWNSTAIRS WAITING FOR YOU.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.272
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?
CAN'T WAIT.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.673
- LOVE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.310
NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.745
THAT'S YOUR WIFE?

17:25.845 --> 17:26.879
YES.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.315
OH MY GOD.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.418
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
WORK TOGETHER ANYMORE.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.486
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? WHY?

17:33.586 --> 17:35.188
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.523
YES, THANK YOU.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.559
I DON'T LIKE WHAT THAT
SAYS ABOUT YOU.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.328
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME?
IT SAYS I HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.897
IT SAYS YOU'RE A VERY
SUPERFICIAL MAN.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.634
- SUPERFICIAL?
- NO DEPTH.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.437
YOU CAN'T
JUDGE ME BECAUSE I HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.939
EH, I THINK I CAN.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.108
I CAN'T TRUST YOU
WITH MY MONEY.
I'M SORRY.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.210
- LARRY, COME ON.
- SORRY, NATHAN.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.312
I'LL--
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.349
SORRY-- SORRY
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.754
- SO MOIST.
- YEAH.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.988
VERY MOIST.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.724
- I'M REALLY FULL.
- YOU ATE A LOT.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.626
- THAT WAS GOOD.
- Gaby: HOW COULD YOU NOT?
IT'S SO GOOD.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.462
I DON'T WANT TO BE PUSHY
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

18:15.562 --> 18:17.330
BUT I KNOW THAT
YOU DROVE THE CAR

18:17.430 --> 18:19.199
AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT.

18:19.299 --> 18:23.503
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE DROVE IT AND...

18:24.571 --> 18:25.638
ALL RIGHT.

18:25.738 --> 18:30.277
( all laughing )

18:30.377 --> 18:32.412
- OH MY GOD.
- OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.647
- THAT IS-- OH MY GOD.
- CAN I HONESTLY SAY

18:34.747 --> 18:37.417
YOU ARE THE FIRST INVENTOR
I'VE EVER HANDED A CHECK TO?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.352
- Larry: ME TOO. ME TOO.
- ( laughing ) OH MY.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.354
- YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.
- I DON'T THINK WE WILL.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.623
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING--
WE HAD SO MUCH FUN

18:43.723 --> 18:45.858
USING THE PROTOTYPE,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.195
WE LOVE IT.
WE JUST LOVE IT.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.029
- IS THE CAR OUTSIDE?
- LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE IT IS.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.832
I'M GONNA GET HIM
INTO THE PROTOTYPE,
GET HIM HIS KEYS BACK.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.301
ALL RIGHT?
WE'LL BE BACK.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.968
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- OH YEAH, OKAY.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.770
- I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE.
- I'M GONNA JUST HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.639
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TRUST.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.409
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- OKAY, GUYS.
IT'S SO GOOD.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.178
YOU KNOW, I WAS
ACTUALLY PLANNING

19:05.278 --> 19:07.680
ON TAKING THAT DISH
HOME WITH ME.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.015
OH YEAH.
WELL, NOT NOW.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.551
( both laughing )

19:11.651 --> 19:13.753
WE COULD GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.
I'LL PAY FOR IT IF YOU WANT.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.657
Larry:
IT'S NOT THE MONEY.
I DID ORDER IT.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.729
Gaby:
MM, THAT'S SO GOOD.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.979
( laughs )

19:40.079 --> 19:42.582
YOU KNOW,
IT'S SO WONDERFUL

19:42.682 --> 19:44.584
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING LIKE THIS
TOGETHER,

19:44.684 --> 19:45.918
- DON'T YOU THINK?
- I KNOW.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.920
Larry: I KNOW.
I'M SO HAPPY.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.656
( Larry and Gaby
giggling )

19:49.756 --> 19:51.123
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

19:51.224 --> 19:55.695
( Larry gibbering )

19:55.795 --> 19:57.797
- OH, I'M FEELING FAINT.
I'M FEELING FAINT, HOLD ON.
- ARE YOU?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.533
- I JUST NEED A SHOULDER
TO REST ON FOR A SECOND.
- OH, LIE DOWN, REST.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.735
- I JUST NEED
TO REST FOR A SECOND.
- OH MY GOD, GOD FORBID.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.905
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.641
IT'S OKAY.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.710
( grunts )

20:12.144 --> 20:14.180
WHY DON'T YOU GO
MEET UP WITH THEM?

20:14.281 --> 20:15.982
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- OKAY? YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.317
I'M SO FULL.
( chuckles )

20:17.417 --> 20:19.786
HEY HEY.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.789
BYE.
LOVE YOU TOO.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.597
- HENRY.
- GREAT TO RUN
INTO YOU AGAIN.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.700
- WHAT A SURPRISE.
- TOTAL SURPRISE.
TOTAL SURPRISE.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.002
UM, WHO WAS THAT?

20:36.102 --> 20:37.970
OH, THAT WAS
MY GIRLFRIEND.

20:38.070 --> 20:38.938
SHE SEEMS LOVELY.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.141
SHE IS--
SHE IS THE BEST.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.311
I CAN TELL.
YOU GUYS--

20:44.411 --> 20:46.212
I'M GONNA MARRY HER
IF SHE'LL HAVE ME.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.080
- REALLY?
- MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.850
HENRY, I LIKE MYSELF
WHEN I'M WITH HER.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.954
LARRY, IT'S SO CLEAR
THAT I MISJUDGED YOU.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.123
AND I CAN SEE NOW

20:57.223 --> 20:59.992
YOU ARE A MAN
OF GREAT CHARACTER.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.028
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.030
I JUST WOULD LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE

21:04.130 --> 21:08.134
FOR MY BEHAVIOR
AT THE PARTY.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.903
HENRY, I DON'T MIND
TELLING YOU IT STUNG.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.238
ARE WE ALL RIGHT?

21:12.339 --> 21:14.073
WE'RE FINE. WE'RE COOL.
WE ARE SO COOL.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.342
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.910
- THANK YOU. UM...
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.212
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:20.313 --> 21:22.749
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD ASK YOU

21:22.849 --> 21:24.817
TO DO ME
A HUGE FAVOR.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.586
SURE.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.556
MY DAD GOES TO THE PARK
EVERY DAY TO PLAY SCRABBLE.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.425
I THINK IT'D BE WONDERFUL
IF YOU SHOWED UP...

21:34.026 --> 21:36.195
OH, HERE YOU GO.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.632
H-A-D--

21:39.732 --> 21:41.033
- "HAD."
- HAD?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.769
FOUR AND ONE--
FIVE AND TWO IS SEVEN.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.438
HAD?
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN
THINK OF-- HAD?

21:45.538 --> 21:47.907
I GUESS I'M JUST NOT
A VERY GOOD PLAYER.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.176
- I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.012
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST NOT THAT GOOD.

21:53.112 --> 21:57.884
C-O-O-N.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.018
COON?

21:59.118 --> 22:00.420
COON.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.855
OKAY, THAT'S NOT A WORD,
ALL RIGHT?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.256
- OH, IT IS.
- NO NO.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.258
THAT'S A RACIAL EPITHET.
THAT'S NOT A WORD.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.529
OH NO?
JUST LOOK AROUND YOU.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.999
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE PARK.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.167
WE'RE SURROUNDED,

22:15.267 --> 22:17.370
AND AFTER I PUT
HALF OF THEM AWAY.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.806
OKAY, JUDGE.

22:19.906 --> 22:23.743
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU "COON."

22:23.843 --> 22:25.177
THAT'S BIG OF YOU.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.146
LET'S PLAY SOME SCRABBLE.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.915
I'M READY.
I'M WAITING.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.583
HUH? LET'S PLAY.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.520
HEY.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.255
HEY.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.225
- UH, HEY.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.593
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
TERRY?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.729
I-- THIS IS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.196
WE'RE WORKING OUT.
HE'S GREAT.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.765
THIS IS MY TIME.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.634
- LOOK AT ME, LARRY.
- YEAH.

22:47.734 --> 22:51.137
WHO WOULD YOU
RATHER RUN AROUND
THE PARK WITH, HUH?

22:51.237 --> 22:53.139
WHY DID YOU GIVE HER
MY TIME?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.608
JUST-- TO BE TOTALLY
HONEST, LARRY,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.478
SHE'S PAYING ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.813
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.882
- IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
- I HAVE MORE TO LOSE.
I HAVE MORE TO LOSE.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.685
THIS IS MY TIME, WANDA.
THIS IS NOT YOUR TIME.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.487
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
FIGURE THIS OUT?

23:07.587 --> 23:09.956
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.258
I-- SORRY.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.826
THIS IS-- YEAH.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.495
WHY ARE YOU IMPOSING
ON MY TIME RIGHT HERE?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.497
IMPOSING ON YOUR TIME?
I RECOMMENDED HIM TO YOU.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.166
LARRY, 2:00 IS
MY ONLY OPEN TIME.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.634
IT'S MY ONLY
OPEN TIME TOO.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.770
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE, OKAY?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.572
I'M SORRY.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.107
WE'RE CLEARLY
AT AN IMPASSE HERE.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.276
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

23:30.376 --> 23:32.912
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.722
- I GOT AN IDEA.
- WHAT?

23:42.822 --> 23:46.158
- YOU KNOW JUDGE HORN
FROM TV?
- OH YEAH.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.495
HE'S AN IMPARTIAL
THIRD PARTY.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.096
WHY DON'T WE
LET HIM DECIDE?
HE'S NEUTRAL.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.531
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.700
WHATEVER HE DECIDES
WE'LL ABIDE BY.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.868

24:01.474 --> 24:03.610
Wanda:

24:25.264 --> 24:27.099
I WILL GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
IF I SEE ANY TOUCHING AT ALL.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.202

REPULSIVE.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.505

24:34.607 --> 24:35.742
I'LL HAVE SOME.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.309
I CAN'T WAIT

24:37.409 --> 24:40.647
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.587
- I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.
- OKAY, YEAH.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.956
I'LL HOLD
YOUR POPCORN.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.091
EH, NOT NECESSARY.

24:52.191 --> 24:55.528
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I'LL HOLD YOUR POPCORN FOR YOU.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.297
NO NO, I'LL JUST TAKE IT
INTO THE BATHROOM.
IT'S FINE.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.166
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE YOUR POPCORN
INTO THE BATHROOM?

25:00.266 --> 25:01.634
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.570
DON'T LEAVE YOUR POPCORN
IN THE BATHROOM.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.538
THE PEOPLE

25:12.178 --> 25:14.146
- REALLY?
- WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD THE POPCORN?

25:14.246 --> 25:16.048
- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THERE'S A PROBLEM.
- THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.483
NO, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A PROBLEM THERE.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.485
LOOK, IT'S MY POPCORN.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.287
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HOLD
THE POPCORN, RIGHT?

25:21.387 --> 25:23.790
BECAUSE WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M GONNA EAT YOUR POPCORN?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.457
EAT MY POPCORN?
THAT'S--

25:25.558 --> 25:27.193
ARE YOU WORRIED SHE'S
GONNA EAT YOUR POPCORN?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.028
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
- I'M REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THIS.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.963
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THIS IS MY WIFE.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.332
- YES YES, I KNOW.
- LARRY, THIS IS MY WIFE.
AND YOU'RE ACCUSING HER.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.534
- I DON'T THINK I CAN BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU.
- WHAT?

25:35.635 --> 25:38.838
- THIS IS REALLY BAD.
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHECK.
- ARE YOU NUTS?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.840
- I'M A MAN OF INTEGRITY.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.575
OBVIOUSLY.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE--

25:42.675 --> 25:43.976
OBVIOUSLY?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.545
WHAT'S THAT?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.015
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN?

25:49.115 --> 25:51.818
NO, ONLY THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A GREAT INVENTOR AND--

25:51.918 --> 25:53.653
HOLD THIS.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.054
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN, HUH?

25:55.154 --> 25:56.288
WHAT ARE YOU--?
OH HERE, TAKE THE POPCORN.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.024
HERE, YOU CAN HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.759
TAKE THE POPCORN.
HERE, TAKE IT.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.994
I DON'T WANT IT.
TAKE IT.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.930
ARGHH!

26:04.030 --> 26:06.666
- THANKS FOR
COMING IN, LARRY.
- PLEASURE.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.401
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
OTHER BUSINESS MANAGERS
YOU'RE MEETING WITH, BUT...

26:09.501 --> 26:10.903
I'M SEEING A FEW MORE.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.805
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LISTEN,

26:12.905 --> 26:15.341
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA

26:15.441 --> 26:18.678
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO INVEST WITH ME.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.079
I'M SOMEWHAT RISK-AVERSE.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.815
I WOULD NEVER, FOR INSTANCE,
PUSH YOU TO SOMETHING--

26:22.915 --> 26:27.153
WHAT WAS IT?
THE-- THOSE SCREW-TOGETHER
SKIS I HEARD ABOUT,

26:27.253 --> 26:30.990
WHICH WAS-- EVERYONE JUST
TOOK AN ABSOLUTE BATH.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.559
- OH, THAT SKI IDEA.
- YEAH, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.862
- HOW STUPID WAS THAT?
- A LOT OF MONEY LOST.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.364
BUT SOMEBODY CAME TO ME
WITH AN IDEA.

26:38.464 --> 26:41.768
I FIND MYSELF SAYING IT'S
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.736
IT'S A CAR PERISCOPE.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.204
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
I CAN'T DO IT.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.707
I HAVE A PERSONAL ISSUE
WITH THE INVENTOR,

26:47.807 --> 26:49.441
SO I'M OUT OF THAT.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.977
OH, THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.279
YOU THINK THAT'S
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR IDEA?

26:53.379 --> 26:55.581
ME PERSONALLY-- I THINK
IT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.583
OH GOD.

26:57.684 --> 27:00.019
AND THAT'S--
ASK AROUND.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.522
BUT AS YOU MAKE THE ROUNDS,
AS YOU MAKE THE ROUNDS,

27:03.622 --> 27:05.958
I JUST WANT YOU TO
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY
DEFINITELY KEEP US IN MIND.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.093
OKAY, I WILL.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.595
- AND GIVE A CALL--
- WHO'S THAT?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.731
OH, THAT'S
MY WIFE AMANDA.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.065
THAT'S YOUR WIFE?

27:13.165 --> 27:16.235
YEP, MET IN COLLEGE--
20 YEARS.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.006
YOU'RE HIRED.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.726
HEY! HEY!

27:39.826 --> 27:42.228
- YOU.
- OH SHIT.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.030
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.998
YOU GOT ME
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
WITH THAT SCRABBLE GAME.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.299
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:47.399 --> 27:49.335
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THAT APARTMENT ANYWAY?

27:49.435 --> 27:50.903
NONE OF YOUR
FUCKING BUSINESS.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.338
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WAS HERE FIRST.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.440
ARE YOU UPSTREAMING ME?
YOU CAN'T UPSTREAM ME.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.875
- UP WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU--?
- I WAS HERE FIRST.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.376
- WHAT ARE YOU--?
- TAXI!

27:57.476 --> 27:59.746
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OUT OF HERE.
TAXI!

27:59.846 --> 28:02.381
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
- TAXI!

28:02.481 --> 28:04.116
- THAT'S MY CAB.
- WHERE?

28:04.216 --> 28:05.885
TAXI!

28:07.086 --> 28:08.921
- MY CAB.
- WHAT? HEY.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.023

BUDDY.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.358
TAXI!

28:12.458 --> 28:14.360

28:14.460 --> 28:16.262
Man:
I TOLD YOU--

28:17.864 --> 28:20.032
GET YOUR OWN CAB!

28:21.500 --> 28:25.004
( Judge Horn moans )

28:27.173 --> 28:28.340
DAD!

28:28.440 --> 28:31.210
DAD, OH MY GOD.
DAD!

28:31.310 --> 28:32.879
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

28:32.979 --> 28:35.347
