Nathan off a building
and watched him fly away,

00:16.100 --> 00:17.715
it all comes
down to you, Noah.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.759
Danko doesn't trust me.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.557
Tell me you didn't
know about this.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.063

00:28.404 --> 00:30.190

tipped her.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.862
Or she saw them coming.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.325
She does that, you know.

to keep you safe.

so that free pass
I had for you went away.

doesn't extend
south of the border.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.092

01:40.226 --> 01:41.716

everyone else?

01:41.811 --> 01:45.224

02:12.174 --> 02:14.210

gonna go for a walk.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.635

probably best that
we stick together, okay?

You're a good son, Peter.

That's why I had
you bring me here.

three gunshots.

I ran in as fast as I could
and I found them like this.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.715

One bullet each
in the back.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.530
Who was their

04:05.663 --> 04:07.494

His DNA was in
the national database.

We're doing that now?

04:23.681 --> 04:26.047
You gonna lecture me
about civil liberties?

04:26.183 --> 04:29.220
No, about sending
your men in blind.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.889

Martin could be anything.

Let's not forget you're
Nathan Petrelli's boy.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.901

to catch this rebel,

catch him, did you?

want the same thing.

years of experience
with these people.

"One of us, one of them."

supported you.

give you support.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.018

Oh, Peter.

16:26.027 --> 16:29.736
There were times
when you were growing up,
you were so confused.

You were so desperate
for answers, and I could've
told you the truth.

given you comfort.
I didn't.

Whoa, okay.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.441
I really messed up.
It's all right.
It's fine.

32:35.204 --> 32:39.698
It's not fine.
You know what I did
when I found out about you?

32:41.710 --> 32:43.917
I did what I always do.

32:44.713 --> 32:48.547
l denied there was
a problem. Just like
I'm doing right now.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.129
You know, we should probably
have this conversation
in the morning.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.131
The truth is, Claire,

32:53.931 --> 32:57.389
| get a pit in my stomach
every time I think of you.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.678
It was just so stupid,
the way I handled it.

33:02.273 --> 33:05.891
You know, I thought
if I kept my distance,

33:05.985 --> 33:08.226
when the time was right,
we would...

33:11.407 --> 33:12.772
Catch up.

33:14.243 --> 33:18.327
But look at you.
| sort of missed my chance,
you're all grown up.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.738
Hardly.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.825
You wanna know
why I gave you a free pass?

33:26.172 --> 33:29.881
Because I thought in one move,
I could win you over.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.087
Wait a minute.
Look at me right now.

33:37.183 --> 33:40.596
I'm using you as an excuse
to hide behind
this mess that l...

33:42.104 --> 33:43.765
You know what?

33:46.859 --> 33:49.271
I know everybody's
counting on me to fix it.

33:50.321 --> 33:51.857
And I wanna try.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.438
I'm gonna do it
for everybody.

33:54.825 --> 33:57.407
Peter, my mom.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.199
For you.

34:04.210 --> 34:08.294
l'll fix it all.
I'll make it all...

34:37.826 --> 34:39.532
I lost him.

34:42.539 --> 34:43.790
Me, too.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.156
I guess he's gone.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.333
For good this time.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.503
Let's go.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.103
You killed him.

35:15.239 --> 35:16.354
No.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.525
He's still alive.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.706
Oh, God.
Wait.

35:29.211 --> 35:32.169
Can you do it
without leaving...

35:36.051 --> 35:37.427
(LAUGHING)

35:43.017 --> 35:45.178
Oh, no. No. Oh, God!

35:45.269 --> 35:47.305
No, no!

35:47.396 --> 35:48.761
(SCREAMING)

35:58.365 --> 36:00.276
NATHAN: Good morning.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.612
Morning.

36:04.580 --> 36:08.744
You really bailed me out
with those kids last night,
I appreciate it.

36:08.876 --> 36:11.618
That's what
family's for, right?

36:12.588 --> 36:15.671
So what's the plan?
Are we going
straight to Washington?

36:15.758 --> 36:17.248
No.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.717
Look, I didn't make
any calls to anybody.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.547
I don't really have
any friends on the Hill
at the moment.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.883
But last night
you said that you
would fix everything.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.559
lwas drunk.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.271
I'm sorry if I got
your hopes up.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.482
There's gotta be
something that you can do.

36:35.611 --> 36:38.444
l'm wide open
if you got any ideas.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.524
Claire,
l overreached,
I screwed up,

36:44.578 --> 36:47.445
and now it's just
way beyond my control.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.832
Some things are
bigger than one man.

37:00.594 --> 37:05.384
You know what?
Over the years

37:05.474 --> 37:10.138
I couldn't help but
think about my real dad.

37:12.314 --> 37:19.026
Who you were, what
you looked like, yourjob.
And then I met you.

37:20.531 --> 37:25.116
And you were more amazing
than anything I could have
ever imagined.

37:26.829 --> 37:27.989
Honey, that's
just a fantasy.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.411
No.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.997
No, it doesn't have to be.

37:32.126 --> 37:35.334
You can do
anything you want.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.498
You can fly.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.131
Claire.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.569
You're supposed
to be Superman.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.337
You feeling better?

38:30.058 --> 38:34.017
I slept and I had a dream.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.103
What about?

38:38.859 --> 38:42.852
That. Or should I say, her?

38:44.072 --> 38:47.109
I know what we
have to do now.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.484
First, we need to go find
Nathan and Claire.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.412
We need to bring
this family together.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.623
And then we need to
go visit my sister.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.542
Sister?

39:19.107 --> 39:21.268
So where you
headed, anyway?

39:21.944 --> 39:24.526
There's
a quarter-past-ocho
to San Diego.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.444
What time is it?

39:28.242 --> 39:29.573
I got nothing.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.616
What happened
to your watch?

39:45.676 --> 39:48.088
I'm heading
back up, you know.

39:49.972 --> 39:50.961
Good.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.823
Coming?

40:54.995 --> 40:56.531
You okay, sir?

41:31.907 --> 41:33.647
Those things will kill you.

41:33.742 --> 41:37.610
So how did that feel?
Zipping up that body bag?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.828
(WOMAN GRUNTING)

41:53.762 --> 41:58.005
Cathartic. Poetic.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.597
And tactically fortunate.

42:06.900 --> 42:12.270
It'll be a lot easier
for us to operate
if everybody thinks I'm dead.

42:12.406 --> 42:16.524
If we do this,
if we succeed,

42:18.745 --> 42:20.827
you'd be the only one left.

42:24.793 --> 42:26.249
Funny how that works.
