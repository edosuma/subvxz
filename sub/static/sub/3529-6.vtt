~ Season 3 - Episode 6 ~
"Search for a New Queen"

02:51.800 --> 02:53.324
Leave us.

02:56.438 --> 02:59.168
Charles, please sit.

03:02.978 --> 03:05.845
The factions and the fighting
that went on inside this court...

03:06.048 --> 03:07.072
...were unacceptable.

03:07.282 --> 03:10.911
I'm appointing you president
of the council and Lord Great Master...

03:11.119 --> 03:15.180
...so in my absence,
all will be answerable to you...

03:15.390 --> 03:17.153
...not Cromwell.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.325
Majesty.

03:19.528 --> 03:21.223
I'm also appointing
Edward Seymour...

03:21.430 --> 03:23.489
...to investigate the activities
of the Poles.

03:23.699 --> 03:26.793
From now on,
they are all under suspicion.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.642
How's your family?

03:41.883 --> 03:43.214
They're well.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.910
Except...

03:48.357 --> 03:51.087
...my wife lost the child
she was carrying.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.423
Then we have both lost something.

04:03.271 --> 04:05.262
Oh, Charles...

04:06.074 --> 04:08.907
...sometimes I think I shall go mad.

04:10.345 --> 04:13.371
My leg is poisoned and hurts again.

04:14.483 --> 04:16.541
I'm afraid that my son
will die of the plague.

04:16.752 --> 04:18.447
And I cannot sleep.

04:18.653 --> 04:20.450
Majesty...

04:21.322 --> 04:24.258
...I know what it is
that we have both lost.

04:27.362 --> 04:29.523
We have lost our youth.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.901
There is nothing in the world
that can ever return it to us.

04:48.784 --> 04:50.945
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:51.686 --> 04:53.483
Lady Salisbury.

04:53.688 --> 04:56.657
You're hungry. Eat.

04:59.828 --> 05:01.318
- Stop, sir.
- Stand aside.

05:01.530 --> 05:02.827
I'm on the king's business.

05:03.031 --> 05:04.623
- What's that?
- I don't know.

05:10.105 --> 05:12.198
Lady Salisbury,
forgive this intrusion.

05:12.407 --> 05:14.170
You and these members
of your family...

05:14.376 --> 05:17.243
...are arrested by the king's orders
on suspicion of treason.

05:17.446 --> 05:20.074
You will all
have to come straight with me.

05:20.282 --> 05:21.977
Not my grandson, surely?

05:25.554 --> 05:27.146
AII.

05:34.496 --> 05:37.056
I wanted to talk to you in private,
Monsieur L'Ambassadeur...

05:37.265 --> 05:39.460
...because I'm inclined
towards a French bride.

05:39.668 --> 05:43.160
Although my advisors think I should
rather seek an imperial match.

05:43.371 --> 05:48.399
I admire Your Majesty's taste
and deplore that of your advisors.

05:48.610 --> 05:52.273
Perhaps they are not
men of the world, as we are.

05:52.481 --> 05:56.611
My Lord Privy Seal spoke to me
of two potential French brides...

05:56.952 --> 05:59.819
...Maria, the king's daughter...

06:00.021 --> 06:03.047
...and Marie de Guise,
Madame de Longueville.

06:03.258 --> 06:05.726
Since I have heard further
of Madame de Longueville...

06:05.927 --> 06:08.487
...I cannot refrain
from considering her as a wife.

06:08.697 --> 06:11.689
Good nose. Peachy.

06:12.067 --> 06:16.333
Cat's piss. Not too sweet.

06:18.773 --> 06:20.240
What have you heard?

06:20.976 --> 06:22.773
The king's daughter's
too young for me.

06:22.978 --> 06:25.208
But Madame de Longueville
is much more suitable...

06:25.413 --> 06:28.905
...being herself a widow
and having already borne two sons...

06:29.117 --> 06:33.144
...and being,
as they say, very voluptuous.

06:34.990 --> 06:38.892
My master told me that
he would think it a great honor...

06:39.094 --> 06:42.257
...if Your Majesty were to take
a French girl as your new wife.

06:42.464 --> 06:44.728
There is no lady
who is not at his command...

06:45.634 --> 06:48.660
...except Madame de Longueville...

06:48.870 --> 06:51.566
...whose marriage
to the king of Scotland...

06:51.773 --> 06:53.240
...has already been arranged.

06:53.441 --> 06:55.272
That arrangement can be broken.

06:56.545 --> 06:59.673
Tell your master that I can do
twice as much for him as my nephew...

06:59.881 --> 07:01.781
...the idiotic
and beggarly Scottish king.

07:01.983 --> 07:03.575
Yes.

07:03.919 --> 07:05.819
Yes, but, sir, in effect...

07:06.021 --> 07:09.422
...then you would be marrying
another man's wife.

07:09.624 --> 07:11.990
I will marry who I like.

07:12.327 --> 07:14.022
Monsieur Castillon...

07:14.229 --> 07:16.925
...I have received offers
from every quarter.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.121
Forgive me.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.824
But His Majesty proposes
a double marriage...

07:21.036 --> 07:24.062
...his 19-year-old son Henry
to your daughter Mary...

07:24.272 --> 07:27.799
...and one of Madame de Longueville's
sisters to you.

07:28.476 --> 07:31.912
There are two of them,
Louise and RenÃ©e.

07:32.113 --> 07:35.480
The former,
remarkably for the French court...

07:35.684 --> 07:38.744
...is rumored to be still a virgin.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.749
Wonderful.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.992
Take her. Take Louise.

07:47.195 --> 07:49.891
Since she is still a maid,
you will have the advantage...

07:50.098 --> 07:54.762
...of shaping the passage
to your measure.

08:22.797 --> 08:24.731
I want to see my father.

08:29.304 --> 08:30.896
Go get my father.

08:35.744 --> 08:37.678
I want my father now.

08:37.879 --> 08:40.506
- You know who I am, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

08:40.715 --> 08:42.273
- Let go of me.
- I know who you are.

08:42.484 --> 08:45.681
You're Master Pole. They say
you're gonna be the king of England.

08:45.887 --> 08:48.253
Let go of me. Let go.

08:51.059 --> 08:53.289
We must discuss marriage.

08:53.862 --> 08:56.831
As usual,
the French want to mess me around.

08:57.632 --> 08:58.929
Who does the emperor propose?

08:59.134 --> 09:02.399
Your Majesty, the emperor
has put forward Christina, his niece...

09:02.604 --> 09:04.572
...the duchess of Milan.

09:04.773 --> 09:05.831
Tell me about her.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.236
Originally from Denmark...

09:08.443 --> 09:11.970
...she was married at 13 to
the duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza...

09:12.180 --> 09:14.148
...who died a year later.

09:14.349 --> 09:18.308
She is now 16, both a widow
and, apparently, still a maid.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.083
She's living in Brussels
with the regent, Mary of Hungary.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.087
She is reported to be
a great beauty...

09:24.292 --> 09:27.728
...and likes nothing better
than hunting and playing cards.

09:28.730 --> 09:31.255
Hunting and playing cards?

09:31.566 --> 09:33.557
I like her already.

09:34.969 --> 09:38.302
Have our ambassador in the
Netherlands find out more about her.

09:38.506 --> 09:40.201
Majesty.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.118
My lord, our ambassador
to the Netherlands, Sir John Hutton.

09:53.321 --> 09:58.418
Sir John, I have some most urgent
business for you to do.

09:58.626 --> 10:01.459
My lord, Mr. Risley has warned me.

10:02.831 --> 10:05.493
You are to make a list
of potential candidates...

10:05.700 --> 10:07.463
...to share His Majesty's bed.

10:07.669 --> 10:09.432
My lord...

10:10.038 --> 10:12.700
...I have not much experience
among ladies...

10:12.907 --> 10:16.343
...therefore, this commission
to me is hard.

10:17.979 --> 10:19.970
You are to go to Brussels.

10:20.648 --> 10:23.845
You are to make inquiries there
about Christina, the duchess of Milan.

10:24.052 --> 10:26.885
But, while you are about it,
go on to the Duchy of Cleves...

10:27.088 --> 10:29.613
...make inquiries there
about the duke's two sisters...

10:29.824 --> 10:32.258
...Amelia and Anne.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.429
I am anxious that they should
enter the reckoning.

10:36.765 --> 10:38.665
Yes, my Lord Cromwell.

10:48.143 --> 10:49.405
I want to see my son.

10:50.178 --> 10:52.544
What have you done with my son?
Where is my son?

10:52.747 --> 10:53.873
Your son is unharmed.

10:54.816 --> 10:58.149
He will remain unharmed until we're
sure that you are not all traitors...

10:58.353 --> 10:59.820
...like your brother Reginald.

11:00.021 --> 11:03.889
You know very well
that my family has disowned Reginald.

11:04.092 --> 11:07.550
Neither my mother nor I support
or condone what he has done.

11:07.762 --> 11:12.028
We openly profess our allegiance
to His Gracious Majesty.

11:17.739 --> 11:21.505
"I like well the proceedings
of my brother, the cardinal.

11:22.444 --> 11:25.470
But I like not
the doings of this realm...

11:25.680 --> 11:28.478
...and I trust to see a change
in this world.

11:28.683 --> 11:32.084
I would wish
that we were both over the sea.

11:32.620 --> 11:35.987
The world in England
waxes all crooked.

11:36.191 --> 11:39.058
The God's law
has been turned upside down...

11:39.260 --> 11:41.194
...abbeys and churches
overthrown."

11:41.396 --> 11:43.421
Who gave you that letter?

11:43.631 --> 11:44.928
Do you deny writing it?

11:48.470 --> 11:50.370
It has a postscript.

11:50.572 --> 11:53.097
"The king
will die one day suddenly...

11:53.308 --> 11:58.905
...his leg will kill him,
and we will have a jolly stirring."

12:00.882 --> 12:07.048
Your professions of loyalty
were all hollow, my Lord Montague.

12:07.355 --> 12:09.414
You are, after all,
the king's cousins.

12:09.624 --> 12:10.989
The last of the Plantagenets.

12:11.192 --> 12:13.251
The last of the White Rose.

12:13.461 --> 12:16.453
Some say you Poles
are the rightful heirs...

12:17.265 --> 12:21.065
...and will someday wear the garland,
don't they?

13:12.520 --> 13:13.885
Sir Francis.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.085
Majesty.

13:21.696 --> 13:24.563
Now that we found evidence against
Henry Pole, Lord Montague...

13:24.766 --> 13:26.927
...we need something
against the lady.

13:27.368 --> 13:30.269
I ask you whether such dishonest
and treacherous sons...

13:30.471 --> 13:32.837
...could ever have had
an honest mother.

13:39.113 --> 13:40.671
Who is that?

13:40.882 --> 13:43.544
She's the widow
of the earl of Egmont.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.446
A widow?

13:47.121 --> 13:48.179
Wait.

13:48.389 --> 13:51.984
It's true she doesn't look it,
but she's over 40.

13:54.996 --> 13:57.191
On the other hand,
there's a maid at court...

13:57.398 --> 14:01.129
...she's only 14,
but she already has a goodly stature.

14:02.437 --> 14:05.031
Let the fruit ripen before you pluck it,
Sir Francis.

14:12.847 --> 14:14.405
- My lord.
- Lord Cromwell.

14:14.616 --> 14:16.447
My Lord Cromwell.

14:19.787 --> 14:21.846
- Majesty.
- Cromwell.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.924
I've just received a letter
from Sir John Hutton...

14:26.127 --> 14:28.118
...the ambassador in Brussels.

14:28.329 --> 14:30.797
He's been making inquiries
on Your Majesty's behalf...

14:30.999 --> 14:34.093
...about the duchess of Milan,
the emperor's niece.

14:34.836 --> 14:35.962
What does he say?

14:36.170 --> 14:38.695
He writes,
"There is none in these parts...

14:38.906 --> 14:41.932
...for beauty of person and birth
to compare with the duchess.

14:42.143 --> 14:44.441
She is not so pure white
as the last queen...

14:44.646 --> 14:47.843
...but when she smiles, there appear
two dimples in her cheeks...

14:48.049 --> 14:51.541
...and one in her chin
that become her very well."

14:53.321 --> 14:54.879
Has he mentioned any other ladies?

14:55.523 --> 15:00.222
Only a sister
of the duke of Cleves, Anne.

15:00.428 --> 15:02.123
- He writes...
- I've heard about her.

15:02.330 --> 15:06.130
They say she is of no great praise,
either of her personage or her beauty.

15:08.136 --> 15:09.125
Forgive me, Majesty.

15:09.337 --> 15:11.202
But on the other hand...

15:11.406 --> 15:13.931
...such a match
could have its advantages.

15:15.309 --> 15:19.905
This realm has long been at the mercy
of the French or of the emperor.

15:20.114 --> 15:22.605
But Cleves is a member
of the Protestant League...

15:22.817 --> 15:26.275
...which daily grows in power across
Europe and could easily rival theirs.

15:26.854 --> 15:32.622
Thus, at last,
could England make its own destiny.

15:36.297 --> 15:38.026
Even so...

15:38.232 --> 15:41.326
...I am anxious to see more
of the duchess of Milan.

15:41.536 --> 15:44.972
I want to be sure
she's as beautiful as Hutton claims.

15:45.907 --> 15:48.603
Send Master Holbein
to do a sketch of her by next tide.

15:49.677 --> 15:51.042
Majesty.

15:51.245 --> 15:52.337
Master Cromwell.

16:14.202 --> 16:15.999
With your permission, madam...

16:16.204 --> 16:19.298
...may I ask if you would consider
marrying the king?

16:19.507 --> 16:21.202
You may ask, sir.

16:21.409 --> 16:22.671
And as for my inclination...

16:22.877 --> 16:25.345
...you know
I am at the emperor's command.

16:25.546 --> 16:27.776
Oh, madam,
how happy you shall be...

16:27.982 --> 16:31.213
...if it be your chance
to be matched with my master.

16:31.419 --> 16:34.047
Shall I? Why?

16:34.255 --> 16:39.352
Oh, my royal master is the most gentle
gentleman that lives.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.858
His nature
is so benign and pleasant...

16:42.063 --> 16:45.328
...that till this day,
I think no man has heard many...

16:45.533 --> 16:49.094
...if any,
angry words pass his mouth.

16:51.038 --> 16:52.335
On the other hand...

16:52.540 --> 16:54.838
...is it not strange that
the King's Majesty...

16:55.042 --> 16:58.170
...was, in so little space,
rid of his three queens?

16:59.547 --> 17:04.108
And they suspect that the first,
my great-aunt, was poisoned...

17:04.318 --> 17:07.082
...the second
innocently put to death...

17:07.288 --> 17:11.917
...and the third
lost for lack of care in her childbed.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.060
Frankly, sir, if I had two heads...

17:15.262 --> 17:18.130
...then one would be
at His Majesty's service.

17:18.332 --> 17:21.061
Alas, I have only this one.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.934
Madam, let me plead
my master's better qualities...

17:25.138 --> 17:26.435
...and appeal to your heart.

17:26.641 --> 17:29.940
No, you must not
labor any further...

17:30.144 --> 17:33.204
...for I shall not fix my heart
that way.

17:34.182 --> 17:38.710
Unless, of course,
the emperor commands me to.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.154
Madam.

18:13.921 --> 18:15.582
Sir Francis.

18:21.128 --> 18:23.619
The royal banner
of the Plantagenets.

18:23.831 --> 18:26.891
My God. What expectation is there.

18:37.478 --> 18:39.309
What's this?

18:41.682 --> 18:43.274
The royal banner.

18:43.484 --> 18:47.614
And this, the most potent
symbol of rebellion...

18:47.822 --> 18:49.722
...discovered in your house.

18:49.924 --> 18:53.655
Sir, I am an old lady.

18:53.861 --> 18:57.319
I have done nothing wrong,
or against the King's Majesty.

18:57.531 --> 19:00.591
You still communicate with your son,
Reginald Pole...

19:00.801 --> 19:03.201
...despite him being a traitor.

19:03.404 --> 19:05.372
No doubt you plot
new treacheries with him.

19:05.573 --> 19:07.939
How can you suppose
that at my age...

19:08.142 --> 19:11.270
...I am capable of plotting anything
against anyone?

19:11.479 --> 19:15.609
I wish only to live a quiet life
away from this world.

19:16.450 --> 19:20.648
That the king in his mercy
could show pity and forgive us.

19:21.255 --> 19:26.158
Madam, you have all been attaindered
for high treason against His Majesty.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.329
The evidence is great against you.

19:29.530 --> 19:33.899
For what you deserve,
you may well beg mercy.

19:34.101 --> 19:37.002
But who shall say
if it be granted or not?

19:43.778 --> 19:46.645
Grandmother, where are you?

19:48.649 --> 19:50.640
Grandmother.

19:55.723 --> 19:58.419
The duchess of Milan is enchanting.

19:58.926 --> 20:00.518
I am singularly pleased.

20:00.728 --> 20:02.525
This picture
makes her look very pretty.

20:02.730 --> 20:06.632
Very full of life.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.268
Keep your hands off her, Charles.

20:14.075 --> 20:17.340
After our wedding,
our younger sons will be ennobled...

20:17.545 --> 20:21.709
...with the ancient dukedoms
of York, Gloucester and Somerset.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.942
And Princess Mary
can marry Don Luis.

20:30.558 --> 20:32.992
That's what you want,
isn't it, Charles?

20:33.861 --> 20:35.795
An imperial wedding...

20:35.997 --> 20:39.398
...just as Wolsey always wanted
a French one.

20:40.301 --> 20:44.465
Everyone has an agenda,
and what I want doesn't matter.

20:44.805 --> 20:46.739
Oh, the Poles have an agenda.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.468
People talk about that poor little boy
in the tower, poor old Lady Salisbury.

20:50.678 --> 20:53.977
But let me tell you, they have
Plantagenet blood in their veins.

20:54.181 --> 20:58.379
And my father told me that if you
leave even a sapling in the ground...

20:58.586 --> 21:00.247
...one day it will grow into a tree.

21:00.454 --> 21:01.648
And that little boy...

21:01.856 --> 21:04.222
...will have 40,000 troops
flocking to his banner...

21:04.425 --> 21:06.450
...and you will be the sucker.

21:09.263 --> 21:11.128
Groom. Groom.

21:19.907 --> 21:21.135
Fetch the king's physician.

21:21.342 --> 21:23.537
For God's sake, man, run!

21:25.179 --> 21:28.171
Charles. Charles.

21:35.890 --> 21:40.418
- My lord, what news of the king?
- How is His Majesty?

21:42.730 --> 21:44.823
Is he recovered?

21:56.477 --> 21:57.967
My lord.

21:58.179 --> 22:00.079
- I must see the king.
- Must?

22:00.281 --> 22:03.341
Just as I must see your nephew,
the prince, but you prevent it.

22:03.551 --> 22:05.883
The king has lain ill for over a week.

22:06.087 --> 22:09.420
There has been no news about him,
so there are rumors.

22:09.623 --> 22:10.988
Some say the king is dead.

22:11.725 --> 22:15.217
That would suit you, wouldn't it?
Since your nephew would be king.

22:15.429 --> 22:16.919
He is a child.

22:17.131 --> 22:18.689
That would be to no one's use.

22:18.899 --> 22:22.027
Not to mine, not to yours,
and not to England's.

22:23.838 --> 22:25.829
With your permission, Your Grace...

22:26.040 --> 22:29.567
...I would like the opportunity
to disprove those rumors.

22:33.547 --> 22:35.174
Very well.

22:46.694 --> 22:49.254
What in the name of God?

22:49.930 --> 22:52.797
This time the ulcer in his leg
has failed to burst...

22:53.000 --> 22:54.991
...as it has always done before.

22:55.202 --> 22:57.762
Then fetch the barber surgeons
to lance it.

22:57.972 --> 22:59.564
That might kill him.

23:05.312 --> 23:06.370
How is His Majesty?

23:06.580 --> 23:10.016
Double the guards around the prince.
No one is to be allowed access to him.

23:10.217 --> 23:11.809
Yes, my lord.

23:38.479 --> 23:41.744
Tell Sir Francis to take a detachment
of the guard to Hunsdon...

23:41.949 --> 23:45.976
...so he and they may keep watch
over the Princess Mary with their lives.

23:48.622 --> 23:49.646
For if the king dies...

23:49.857 --> 23:51.825
...some will be for the boy,
others for her.

23:52.026 --> 23:54.017
Yes, Your Grace.

24:15.716 --> 24:17.877
Oh, Lord.

24:20.221 --> 24:21.916
Lord.

24:24.325 --> 24:26.384
What shall I do?

24:54.955 --> 24:59.221
Mr. Cromwell,
I bid you call for the surgeon barbers.

25:00.494 --> 25:02.485
I will answer for it.

25:05.866 --> 25:07.663
Yes, Your Grace.

25:30.491 --> 25:33.517
Your Majesty, forgive me.

26:24.044 --> 26:27.070
Long live the king.

26:30.217 --> 26:33.550
Long live the prince, Edward.

26:33.821 --> 26:36.085
Long live the king!

26:37.291 --> 26:39.816
Long live Prince Edward!

27:00.547 --> 27:02.378
Soft now.

27:14.928 --> 27:16.054
How is the child?

27:16.263 --> 27:19.494
He is the sweetest, prettiest boy
that ever lived.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.463
Keep him safe.

27:22.269 --> 27:24.863
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.

27:40.754 --> 27:42.847
Have you spoken
to Castillon recently?

27:43.056 --> 27:44.421
Yes, Majesty.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.650
What did he say
about Madame de Longueville?

27:46.860 --> 27:51.695
She has already got married
to the king of Scotland.

27:51.899 --> 27:54.993
She'll regret it when she sees
what the weather is like up there.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.600
There are two other cousins
of King Francis...

27:58.806 --> 28:00.967
...potentially available
to Your Majesty.

28:01.175 --> 28:03.439
Marie de Vendome
and Anne of Lorraine.

28:04.011 --> 28:07.276
Marie de Vendome has announced
her intention to become a nun...

28:07.481 --> 28:11.247
...although Castillon thought
that not necessarily an obstacle.

28:11.919 --> 28:13.409
How very French.

28:15.255 --> 28:16.688
I need pictures.

28:16.890 --> 28:20.223
Do you understand?
I need to see them.

28:20.427 --> 28:23.828
I need to see the woman who is
gonna be my companion for life.

28:27.534 --> 28:29.798
All right there.

28:30.571 --> 28:33.438
What of the negotiations
with the duchess of Milan?

28:33.640 --> 28:35.369
There is the problem of affinity.

28:36.610 --> 28:39.204
As niece to the emperor...

28:39.413 --> 28:45.579
...the duchess is therefore
great-niece to Catherine of Aragon.

28:47.354 --> 28:50.790
In the past, such obstacles might have
been overcome by papal dispensation.

28:50.991 --> 28:53.221
Well, there's no question
of that now.

28:54.061 --> 28:56.291
But, perhaps,
as head of the Church of England...

28:56.497 --> 28:59.694
...the emperor will allow me
to make a dispensation.

29:01.768 --> 29:04.464
Yes, Majesty. Naturally.

29:09.042 --> 29:11.943
It will take a good sport
to make me feel amorous again.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.475
Going.

29:24.424 --> 29:26.915
I thought your husband warned you
to stay away from me.

29:27.127 --> 29:29.618
Oh, he did.
But now he doesn't care.

29:29.830 --> 29:31.798
He said
he couldn't be bothered to kill you.

29:31.999 --> 29:35.833
You know, the less I know about your
husband, the more he fascinates me.

29:36.036 --> 29:38.334
See, I know, more or less,
where most people stand.

29:38.539 --> 29:41.997
Like Suffolk, Cromwell,
I know their true beliefs...

29:42.209 --> 29:44.473
...even if they try to hide them.

29:44.845 --> 29:48.337
But Edward,
who knows what he truly believes?

29:48.549 --> 29:50.141
Would you like me to tell you?

29:50.350 --> 29:52.181
For services rendered.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.011
You're not quite as good
as you think you are.

29:57.024 --> 30:00.425
That's still pretty good. Tell me.

30:01.094 --> 30:03.062
He believes in himself.

30:03.263 --> 30:05.322
In his destiny.

30:05.799 --> 30:07.960
Prince Edward
is the key to his destiny.

30:08.168 --> 30:09.999
Nothing will stand in his way.

30:10.837 --> 30:12.031
He's a Reformer?

30:13.740 --> 30:15.469
No, you can answer.
I am too, I swear.

30:15.676 --> 30:19.544
Everyone knows
I hate popery with a passion.

30:19.746 --> 30:22.806
That's why sometimes
they call me the Black Pope.

30:23.016 --> 30:26.383
Hello.
I've just been fucked by the pope.

30:41.802 --> 30:43.326
How does he think about Cromwell?

30:44.871 --> 30:47.066
That I don't know.

30:47.841 --> 30:51.800
But did anyone ever discover...

30:52.012 --> 30:55.573
...who shot Robert Packington, MP?

31:12.866 --> 31:14.424
Amen.

31:15.836 --> 31:18.031
My Lord Montague...

31:18.238 --> 31:21.799
...I am here to help you
to a better place.

31:22.009 --> 31:24.978
You know I'm not guilty,
you bastard.

31:25.178 --> 31:27.942
Only my brother is guilty
but you can't touch him, can you?

31:28.148 --> 31:30.480
So you have to kill the innocent.

31:30.684 --> 31:33.278
Your guilt has been established
beyond question.

31:33.487 --> 31:36.923
There used to be proper legal
procedures in this country...

31:37.124 --> 31:39.922
...to establish who was guilty
and who was not.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.191
But that's all gone now.

31:45.399 --> 31:48.368
You don't even have to have a trial.

31:48.568 --> 31:53.301
So since there is no judiciary,
what's left is only tyranny.

31:59.346 --> 32:00.677
Where is my mother?

32:01.982 --> 32:07.147
Lady Salisbury is here,
within the tower.

32:07.354 --> 32:10.448
Please have a care for her,
my Lord Bishop.

32:11.058 --> 32:14.494
Whatever she may have done,
be it so offensive...

32:15.395 --> 32:17.625
...she is an old and true woman...

32:17.831 --> 32:21.528
...and has always lived
under the precepts of God.

32:21.735 --> 32:25.171
I will have a tender care for her...

32:25.672 --> 32:28.698
...body and soul, my lord.

32:28.909 --> 32:30.399
Trust me.

32:33.246 --> 32:35.407
You know, my lord...

32:36.083 --> 32:38.278
...this is the truth:

32:38.618 --> 32:43.385
The king never made a man
but he destroyed him again.

32:43.824 --> 32:46.452
So take good care, my lord.

32:54.901 --> 32:56.493
Come along.

33:15.455 --> 33:18.618
I like the look of some of these
French girls more than the others...

33:18.825 --> 33:20.759
...but can the likeness be trusted?

33:21.194 --> 33:24.994
Could the artist be not using license
to either flatter the lady or please me?

33:25.198 --> 33:26.756
Even Mr. Holbein?

33:28.435 --> 33:31.768
How can I make a decision
when I haven't met them in the flesh?

33:31.972 --> 33:33.337
Talk to Castillon.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.098
Majesty.

33:38.612 --> 33:42.048
If Your Majesty
might still choose to consider...

33:42.249 --> 33:46.185
...the simple but profound charms
of Anne of Cleves or of her sister...

33:46.386 --> 33:50.948
...and of the benefits to you of a new
alignment with the Protestant League.

33:54.928 --> 33:56.953
His Grace,
the bishop of Winchester.

33:57.164 --> 33:58.256
My Lord Bishop.

33:58.465 --> 34:00.296
Majesty.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.210
Your Majesty, forgive me...

34:16.416 --> 34:20.409
...but it has come to my attention
that certain evangelicals...

34:20.620 --> 34:24.818
...are still preaching
against the Six Articles of Faith...

34:25.025 --> 34:28.255
...and Your Majesty's
religious agreement.

34:28.460 --> 34:32.261
Mr. John Lambert is one such...

34:32.465 --> 34:36.731
...who preaches once a week
in London to large audiences.

34:36.937 --> 34:41.203
Mr. Lambert
denies the real presence of God...

34:41.408 --> 34:43.933
...in the sacrament of Communion...

34:44.277 --> 34:50.045
...saying rather that it is merely
a symbolic commemoration...

34:50.250 --> 34:52.013
...of the passion of Christ.

34:52.619 --> 34:55.281
Then Mr. Lambert will be condemned
in Christ's own words...

34:55.487 --> 34:58.184
...who said, "This is my body."

34:58.692 --> 35:02.025
He will recant or be burned.
I will not patron heretics.

35:08.201 --> 35:09.498
Is there more?

35:10.971 --> 35:15.874
Perhaps it is none of my business,
Your Majesty...

35:16.076 --> 35:21.378
...but I am told that Mr. Lambert
is well known to my Lord Cromwell.

35:22.382 --> 35:25.112
It appears that they were educated
together at Cambridge...

35:25.318 --> 35:27.115
...and some six months ago...

35:27.320 --> 35:29.754
...when Lambert
was apprehended...

35:29.956 --> 35:35.258
...on suspicion
of promoting religious heresy...

35:36.930 --> 35:40.195
...my Lord Cromwell
had the charges dismissed.

35:45.338 --> 35:47.203
Thank you, my Lord Bishop.

35:59.419 --> 36:02.445
What news of the king's marriage
to the duchess of Milan?

36:02.656 --> 36:05.955
Alas, princess,
I think it is not to happen.

36:06.626 --> 36:08.992
The duchess
is the great-niece of your mother...

36:09.195 --> 36:12.028
...and so the affinity is too touching.

36:13.066 --> 36:16.092
Also, I think the lady
does not want to marry the king.

36:17.237 --> 36:21.196
Then I shall not marry Don Luis.

36:23.643 --> 36:26.203
They say the king may now marry
a French lady...

36:26.780 --> 36:28.941
...and you
one of the French king's sons.

36:29.149 --> 36:31.242
Surely that would not please you?

36:31.451 --> 36:34.682
Anything would please me, my lady,
which made you happy.

36:36.323 --> 36:40.123
I'm afraid I was not born
for happiness, Excellency.

36:45.098 --> 36:48.067
I hear Lady Salisbury
is being kept in the tower...

36:48.268 --> 36:50.736
...and her son executed.

36:51.438 --> 36:53.531
It is sadly so.

36:54.341 --> 36:56.775
Her grandson, too,
is being kept a prisoner.

36:58.745 --> 37:01.908
I am sure it is all Cromwell's doing.

37:03.216 --> 37:07.084
I should not say this to many people,
Excellency, but I say it to you...

37:07.387 --> 37:10.754
...that I agree with those who say
he is messenger of Satan.

37:10.957 --> 37:14.154
I swear he has poisoned
the king's mind.

37:14.995 --> 37:16.690
And if I could...

37:16.896 --> 37:21.265
...I would strip him from
the king's side and burn him.

37:29.209 --> 37:32.372
His Excellency,
the French ambassador.

37:32.746 --> 37:35.078
- Monsieur Castillon.
- Majesty.

37:35.281 --> 37:38.546
We have been considering
all these candidates for our hand.

37:38.752 --> 37:39.741
There are so many.

37:39.953 --> 37:43.013
Indeed. A warren
of honorable ladies.

37:43.223 --> 37:44.622
Quite.

37:44.824 --> 37:46.416
But the fact is,
in the circumstances...

37:46.626 --> 37:48.457
...because so many of them
appear attractive...

37:48.661 --> 37:51.687
...I do not see
how I can approach them individually.

37:52.132 --> 37:58.298
So perhaps King Francis can assemble
seven or eight of them at Calais...

37:58.505 --> 38:01.941
...then I could go there and make their
acquaintance all at the same time.

38:02.142 --> 38:05.543
No, it is not the French custom
to send ladies of that rank...

38:05.745 --> 38:07.576
...of such noble
and princely families...

38:07.781 --> 38:11.683
...to be passed in review
as if they were prize horses.

38:12.786 --> 38:15.482
Perhaps if Your Majesty
desires one of these ladies...

38:15.688 --> 38:19.454
...you could send an envoy to report
on manner and appearance...

38:19.659 --> 38:20.990
...in the traditional way.

38:21.194 --> 38:23.219
I trust no one but myself.

38:23.797 --> 38:26.357
The thing touches me too near.

38:26.566 --> 38:29.194
I want to see and know them
before deciding.

38:29.803 --> 38:32.863
Maybe your Majesty would like
to mount them one after another...

38:33.073 --> 38:36.975
...and then pick the one
you find best broken in.

38:40.613 --> 38:44.845
Monsieur Castillon, you have
10 seconds to get out of my court...

38:45.051 --> 38:48.020
...or I will beat you
like the dog that you are.

39:01.167 --> 39:03.226
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.

39:04.237 --> 39:06.000
An incorrigible heretic
called John Lambert...

39:06.206 --> 39:09.369
...is now imprisoned in the tower
and likely soon to be burned.

39:09.576 --> 39:11.339
I believe you know this man.

39:11.544 --> 39:15.241
I knew him many years ago
at Cambridge.

39:15.448 --> 39:16.881
Not since?

39:17.750 --> 39:20.241
Not to my knowledge, Your Majesty.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.218
And whilst you were
at Cambridge together...

39:23.423 --> 39:25.618
...did you share
some of his opinions?

39:26.793 --> 39:28.727
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell...

39:29.629 --> 39:31.460
...what do you believe now?

39:32.332 --> 39:36.200
As the world stands, Your Majesty,
I believe what you believe.

39:36.903 --> 39:39.736
So you think it right
that he should be burned?

39:40.573 --> 39:41.870
Yes.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.202
Unless he recants.

39:44.410 --> 39:45.877
Yes.

39:52.318 --> 39:55.913
Oh, I forgot.
What were their names again?

39:56.723 --> 39:57.917
Majesty?

39:58.124 --> 39:59.887
The sisters of the duke of Cleves.

40:00.593 --> 40:02.618
Amelia and Anne.

40:03.496 --> 40:05.589
Amelia and Anne.

40:09.202 --> 40:12.296
Send someone to take a look at them.
We'll have a second opinion.

40:12.972 --> 40:14.599
Majesty.

40:35.261 --> 40:38.230
Duke William will receive you now.

40:43.203 --> 40:44.864
Your Highness...

40:46.206 --> 40:48.367
...the English envoys.

40:51.978 --> 40:53.673
Gentlemen.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.609
Your Highness.

40:58.484 --> 41:03.683
So His Majesty King Henry
needs a wife...

41:05.258 --> 41:07.385
...and he is interested in my sisters.

41:07.594 --> 41:11.086
Yes, His Majesty has been persuaded
of their amiability...

41:11.297 --> 41:13.959
...and of their suitability
as royal consorts.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.101
Especially Anne, the eldest...

41:16.302 --> 41:19.465
...who has been much praised
in the king's hearing.

41:20.139 --> 41:21.697
I am not surprised.

41:21.908 --> 41:23.967
His Majesty
would also propose the marriage...

41:24.177 --> 41:27.010
...of his daughter Mary
to your eldest son...

41:27.213 --> 41:29.977
...a liaison
with the Protestant League...

41:30.183 --> 41:36.247
...and the recruitment of a hundred
seasoned cannoneers for his army.

41:36.456 --> 41:38.720
There is, then, gentlemen,
much to discuss.

41:38.925 --> 41:40.085
Indeed.

41:40.293 --> 41:44.855
But, first, we should like
your permission to meet your sisters.

41:45.265 --> 41:46.254
Why?

41:47.100 --> 41:52.037
The king will expect us
to report back on what we have seen.

41:52.238 --> 41:55.071
To say that we have
not seen the ladies...

41:55.275 --> 41:57.436
...would not exactly please him.

41:57.644 --> 42:00.238
He has also asked
for a portrait of Anne...

42:00.446 --> 42:02.380
...to be sent back to him.

42:04.751 --> 42:08.517
Unfortunately, my court painter,
Mr. Cranach...

42:08.721 --> 42:12.213
...is ill and indisposed.

42:13.426 --> 42:17.055
In that case,
we can send over Mr. Holbein...

42:17.263 --> 42:19.356
...who is an admirable artist.

42:19.565 --> 42:20.554
Indeed.

42:20.767 --> 42:23.327
Yes, perhaps.

42:23.770 --> 42:25.863
But you are going too quickly.

42:26.072 --> 42:28.700
What do you think my country is,
a meat market?

42:30.076 --> 42:33.705
I will arrange with my chancellor
for negotiations to commence.

42:33.913 --> 42:38.043
And you may have the opportunity,
at some stage...

42:38.251 --> 42:40.879
...of being presented to my sisters.

42:41.421 --> 42:43.389
Your Highness, we...

42:43.589 --> 42:46.524
We will meet again.

42:47.093 --> 42:48.958
Good day, gentlemen.

43:00.573 --> 43:03.940
Get off that wall.
Where do you think you are?

43:05.311 --> 43:06.300
John.

43:09.182 --> 43:12.242
Thomas, how good to see you.

43:12.452 --> 43:14.943
And how excellently you have done
in the world.

43:16.422 --> 43:18.913
I could wish our reunion
was in some better place.

43:19.826 --> 43:22.420
Oh, I shall be quit of this place
soon enough...

43:22.628 --> 43:25.461
...and on my way
to a far better place.

43:29.302 --> 43:30.860
Hold it.

43:31.337 --> 43:33.328
Bow your head down.

43:34.907 --> 43:36.636
John, you do not have to die.

43:36.843 --> 43:39.004
All you have to say
to satisfy the king...

43:39.212 --> 43:41.112
...is that after Consecration...

43:41.314 --> 43:44.283
...the wafer and the wine are truly
the body and blood of Christ.

43:44.484 --> 43:46.213
But you and I know they are not.

43:46.686 --> 43:50.588
You don't have to believe it,
you just have to say it.

43:50.790 --> 43:52.485
Oh, Thomas...

43:52.692 --> 43:56.150
...I see now what it takes for a man
to make his way in this world.

43:56.362 --> 43:59.195
He must make a practice
of hypocrisy.

44:00.466 --> 44:01.455
Keep moving.

44:01.667 --> 44:04.363
There is no harm in discretion.

44:06.572 --> 44:09.973
I want to spare you the awful pains
which have been prepared for you.

44:10.176 --> 44:11.541
Hold the line.

44:12.211 --> 44:15.339
Did Christ himself
not suffer awful pains, Thomas?

44:15.548 --> 44:17.709
We do not need martyrs.

44:17.917 --> 44:19.509
We need living men...

44:19.719 --> 44:21.687
...who will go on about
quietly spreading...

44:21.888 --> 44:23.913
...the business of our Reformation.

44:24.123 --> 44:25.852
But who will believe a word I say...

44:26.058 --> 44:28.959
...if I alter my opinion
on such a fundamental thing?

44:29.162 --> 44:33.724
John, I say to you again,
while you still have a free choice...

44:33.933 --> 44:36.766
...will you live or die?

44:45.912 --> 44:48.039
My dear Lord Cromwell...

44:48.781 --> 44:52.649
...I see that all this while, we have not
been talking about me but about you.

44:52.852 --> 44:54.319
Not my conscience but yours.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.387
I see that you are afraid
of guilt by association...

44:57.590 --> 45:00.889
...and would rather
I perjured my own soul.

45:01.527 --> 45:06.487
Alas, it's the only thing in this world
I have left.

45:11.037 --> 45:14.200
I am sorry you choose
not to save yourself.

45:17.643 --> 45:19.474
Get back, you rabble.

45:19.679 --> 45:21.977
Get back in the name of the king.

45:24.283 --> 45:26.274
Over there.

45:36.462 --> 45:38.623
I'll pray for you.

45:45.805 --> 45:47.830
All for Christ.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.838
All for Christ.

46:10.463 --> 46:13.296
All for Christ.

46:24.210 --> 46:26.007
Majesty.

46:28.481 --> 46:31.143
Mr. Lambert
has gone to his execution.

46:31.717 --> 46:33.514
And to hell.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.323
Princess Mary begs you to spare
the life of the Lady Salisbury...

46:44.530 --> 46:47.192
...who she says
was like a mother to her.

46:49.302 --> 46:51.532
She was also a mother
to Reginald Pole...

46:51.737 --> 46:54.035
...whom even heaven can't forgive.

46:57.843 --> 47:01.802
Duke William says
that his painter is ill.

47:02.014 --> 47:05.677
He cannot furnish images
of his sister Anne.

47:06.719 --> 47:08.584
Send Holbein.

47:09.021 --> 47:11.182
I must see her image.

47:13.492 --> 47:14.823
Majesty.

47:15.027 --> 47:16.756
Mr. Cromwell.

47:44.357 --> 47:46.052
Gentlemen.

47:51.197 --> 47:54.894
You have my permission
to look upon my sisters.

48:08.047 --> 48:09.776
Your Highness...

48:11.684 --> 48:15.142
...we cannot even tell which is Anne
and which Amelia.

48:15.354 --> 48:17.618
Sirs, I am Anne.

48:17.823 --> 48:20.291
And I am Amelia, Your Honors.

48:20.993 --> 48:22.927
Your Highness...

48:23.129 --> 48:28.123
...for our purposes, this is no good.

48:28.334 --> 48:30.996
No good? What?

48:31.203 --> 48:32.898
Would you see them naked?

48:56.896 --> 48:59.364
Have you not been praying, lady?

48:59.565 --> 49:01.430
Your head
is going to be cut off now.

49:02.668 --> 49:04.795
No.

49:05.004 --> 49:06.130
I don't want to die.

49:07.206 --> 49:10.300
I don't want to die. No, please,
don't hurt me. Please, no, don't...

49:10.509 --> 49:12.943
Don't hurt me. I don't want to die.

49:13.145 --> 49:14.510
No. Oh, don't kill me.

49:14.714 --> 49:16.614
No. Oh, God save me.

49:16.816 --> 49:19.307
- Oh, God help me.
- For God's sake, have some dignity.

49:19.518 --> 49:23.215
No, no, I don't want to die.

49:40.272 --> 49:42.399
- Eminence.
- My child.

49:42.608 --> 49:44.007
My poor child.

49:44.210 --> 49:46.041
He's killed them.

49:46.245 --> 49:48.110
My brother. My poor mother.

49:48.314 --> 49:49.804
Oh, Jesus.

49:50.015 --> 49:54.816
The king of England is the most cruel
and abominable tyrant.

49:55.020 --> 49:57.580
There is no doubt now,
he must be overthrown by force.

49:57.790 --> 49:59.417
Better that he should die...

49:59.625 --> 50:03.220
...than risk the eternal damnation
of all his subjects.

50:03.763 --> 50:05.321
But there's nothing we can do.

50:05.531 --> 50:07.021
But we can.

50:07.233 --> 50:11.033
His Holiness is ready to promulgate
the bull of excommunication.

50:11.237 --> 50:13.171
The emperor
and the French have made peace.

50:13.372 --> 50:16.341
They are now both willing
to point their swords at England.

50:16.542 --> 50:20.603
They will withdraw their ambassadors
and prepare a fleet for invasion.

50:20.813 --> 50:24.340
And the Holy Father expects you
to return to the Netherlands...

50:24.550 --> 50:26.609
...and to France
to assist their preparations.

50:26.819 --> 50:28.411
No.

50:29.054 --> 50:31.989
No, please.
Let me help in other ways.

50:32.191 --> 50:33.317
What?

50:33.526 --> 50:35.790
Tell me. Are you frightened?

50:37.062 --> 50:40.930
You should thank God that he
has called your family to heaven.

50:41.133 --> 50:44.193
You should not weep.
What is belief?

50:44.403 --> 50:47.702
What is belief
if not belief in the will of God?

50:47.907 --> 50:51.809
You think the Holy Father wants you
to go to the Netherlands for his sake?

50:52.011 --> 50:54.445
Don't you think
he has asked God for guidance?

50:57.616 --> 50:59.277
Forgive me.

51:02.688 --> 51:07.887
Well, when I was a young priest
in Germany...

51:08.093 --> 51:12.427
...my family's house was occupied
by Lutheran mercenaries.

51:12.631 --> 51:14.656
I had a beautiful sister...

51:14.867 --> 51:17.893
...whom I loved
more than anything else in the world...

51:18.103 --> 51:22.631
...and perhaps even more than God.

51:22.842 --> 51:27.279
Well, they raped her,
they cut off her breasts...

51:27.479 --> 51:31.347
...and they threw pieces of her
to their dogs...

51:31.817 --> 51:33.944
...right in front of my eyes.

51:42.361 --> 51:47.594
All of us have burdens to carry,
Cardinal Pole.

52:09.521 --> 52:11.989
Come along now, Master Pole.

53:19.058 --> 53:22.585
There you are, Cardinal Pole.

53:22.795 --> 53:26.925
Now, eat your heart.
