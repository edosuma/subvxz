WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:04.436
I need it. I have
a big day at work today.
I need it more.

00:04.438 --> 00:07.006
I have to bake
muffins before work.
What? Why?

00:07.008 --> 00:09.608
'Cause it's for my "Lunch With
Your Princi-Pal" campaign.

00:09.610 --> 00:13.445
See, being principal's great,
but unlike being vice principal,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.014
now the buck stops with me.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.383
I'm "the Man" now,
and all the kids

00:17.385 --> 00:20.285
can just smell "the Man"
all over me.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.287
That sounded really weird.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.389
All I'm saying is

00:23.391 --> 00:25.791
suddenly I have no relationship
with the kids.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.560
I'm really counting on
these muffins to humanize me.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.995
I deserve that coffee.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.831
I'm finally director of
marketing at Ass Strat.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.834
Today I get to hire
an assistant.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.504
I'm gonna be tough, but
I won't be a screamer.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.639
It's not constructive,
it's rude.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.508
Ooh, coffee.
Your pour that coffee down,
you throw it

00:42.510 --> 00:44.009
or I'll pour your blood
on the ground!

00:44.011 --> 00:45.677
You'll pour my blood
on the ground?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.413
I'll knife you!
Look, I got a full day

00:47.415 --> 00:48.814
of writing ahead of me,

00:48.816 --> 00:50.816
and that requires
a fourth cup of joe.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.651
What else is my
whiskey gonna swim in?

00:52.653 --> 00:54.420
You're taking this too far.
You treat that heart of yours

00:54.422 --> 00:55.587
like a baseball-man's mitt.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.057
Uh, hello, I am the one
packing for our move today,

00:58.059 --> 01:00.659
so I will be having,
uh, the coffee.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.194
(all clamoring)

01:02.196 --> 01:03.228
I get the coffee!
Enough is enough with this!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.596
What are you
doing here, Winston?!

01:04.598 --> 01:07.032
I get the coffee!
Enough!

01:07.034 --> 01:09.501
You guys are
tearing each other apart.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.104
For what? Coffee?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.372
Come on, man,

01:13.374 --> 01:14.673
you already
got that energy

01:14.675 --> 01:15.707
inside of you.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.677
And that is
the light of the Lord.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.512
(chuckles) Man, this?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.748
This ain't nothing
but the devil's water.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.051
Nah, I'm just playing.
Hey, Winston!

01:26.053 --> 01:28.053
(all clamoring)
Winston, that wasn't fair!

01:28.055 --> 01:29.688
I'll knife you
by the urinal, Winston!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.423
Enough with the knifing.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.158
♪ ♪

01:35.262 --> 01:37.696
Today's the day
it all turns around.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.432
Hey.
Sorr... I'm sorry
I hit you, Jess.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.468
I didn't mean to.
I'm using magnetic words

01:42.470 --> 01:44.636
to break through my writer's
block, and it's not working.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.605
I've already folded
all my shirts and masturbated

01:46.607 --> 01:49.641
six times, and I'm running out
of things to do.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.144
I'm just in a real bind. You
see,<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles</i>

01:52.146 --> 01:54.246
sold over 30 copies, Jess.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.881
So, what, we're complaining
about good things now?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.916
It's just, my audience is gonna
be clamoring for a sequel,

01:57.918 --> 01:59.818
and I can't
leave those stevedores,

01:59.820 --> 02:01.920
those-those tugboat workers,

02:01.922 --> 02:03.722
those lighthouse keepers
empty-handed.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.458
You think that your audience
is entirely made of, like...

02:06.460 --> 02:08.794
Blue-collar nautical workers
on the coastline of Maine.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.597
I don't think that, Jess,
I know that.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.398
Okay, Nick, you're
incredibly talented.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.267
You can do this.
And you have the key,

02:15.269 --> 02:16.435
and the key is simply...

02:16.437 --> 02:17.669
(phone alarm beeping)

02:17.671 --> 02:20.139
Oh. I have to go.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.173
Simply what?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.275
Jess, simply what?!
(door closes)

02:23.277 --> 02:24.243
(groans)

02:25.679 --> 02:28.680
All right.
What do we have here?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.649
"Sentient feces."

02:30.651 --> 02:33.852
Why is there a magnet
that says "feces"?

02:33.854 --> 02:36.421
All right. Trust the process.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.824
Ugh. Thanks for helping me pack.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.527
No problem. This might be our
last chance for a mess-around.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.029
Don't you start with that
last mess-around stuff.
Don't<i> you</i> start.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.864
Don't start, 'cause
then I'll start. Look,
I'm already starting.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.666
Don't start.
I didn't start this whole thing.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.268
I can't do it, okay?
(sighs) Okay.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.637
Okay, we agreed,

02:51.639 --> 02:54.139
let's just pack, okay? Great.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.708
Furguson?
Where have you been?
What? Hi!

02:56.710 --> 02:58.277
WINSTON: Huh?
When you leave the house,

02:58.279 --> 02:59.845
you take your cell phone
with you.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.782
Oh! Oh, thank you so much
for grabbing my cat.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.551
Come on, Sweatshirt, there's
still some sashimi left

03:05.553 --> 03:06.818
between my toes.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.189
Uh, this here is, uh,
Winston's cat, Furguson.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.691
Sweatshirt walked
through my door a year ago,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.893
and while he may come
and go as he pleases,

03:14.895 --> 03:18.163
he loves Mommy
and her little milkies.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.965
Yes, he does.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.700
I'm his home.
Oh, really?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.835
So why do I have a photo
of Furguson

03:23.837 --> 03:25.003
on my phone?

03:25.005 --> 03:26.305
Oh, yeah?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.407
Then why do I have
a picture of Sweatshirt

03:28.409 --> 03:30.442
on my sweatshirt?
Oh, damn.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.813
Furguson, you got...

03:34.815 --> 03:37.182
you got two families,
you dirty dog.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.485
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I'm Winston. This is Cece.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.789
Name's Gil--
like the man's name, but for me.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.226
Cornell.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.594
Magna cum laude.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.663
Two years of executive
assistant experience.

03:51.665 --> 03:55.033
Very nice. Is this
24-pound linen stock?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.269
Uh, yeah, it is.
Impressive. Ken,
do me a favor.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.771
Will you, uh, untie your tie?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.674
Uh, I can't, actually.
It's, um... it's a clip-on.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.109
I know.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.911
Thanks so much, son.
See yourself out.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.413
Next.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.515
MAN:
Hello, sir.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.184
Hello.
My name is Jeremy.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.552
Thank you.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.287
Let me give you
a scenario.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.122
We land the
Bronco Blue Jeans account

04:17.124 --> 04:20.025
and install Brett Favre
as its face.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.394
You receive a call
from a nosy maître d'.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.763
It appears that Brett
has been spotted

04:24.765 --> 04:26.632
at the Ritz-Carlton
eating a salad,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.233
dressed in a tuxedo.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.868
The paparazzi
are on their way.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.637
You rush in to alert me.
You find me dead.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.771
What do you do?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.773
I find a honky-tonk bar
near the Ritz Carlton.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.742
I leave a pair of perfectly
broken-in Bronco Blue Jeans

04:36.744 --> 04:38.944
in Mr. Favre's size, as well as
a grass-stained T-shirt

04:38.946 --> 04:40.379
on the floor of the bathroom.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.614
I get on the phone, rent a
tractor, drive it directly into

04:42.616 --> 04:43.949
the swimming pool
of the Ritz-Carlton.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.417
When the staff is distracted,
I physically subdue

04:45.419 --> 04:47.419
Mr. Favre under the weight
of my full body,

04:47.421 --> 04:50.322
look him in the eyes
and tell him to repeat after me:

04:50.324 --> 04:53.592
"I got drunk playing football
and remember nothing since.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.160
"I would never knowingly
wear a tuxedo, drive a tractor

04:55.162 --> 04:57.062
"into a swimming pool
or eat a salad.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.463
"And I would never knowingly

04:58.465 --> 04:59.665
leave my Bronco Blue Jeans
behind."

04:59.667 --> 05:00.832
And the maître d'?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.901
I rented the tractor
in his name.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.971
The next call he'll be making
will be from the police station.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.909
Welcome to Ass Strat.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.745
Muffin? Muffin.
They're homemade.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.980
Blueberry. Look out,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.315
principal's coming! (chuckles)

05:16.317 --> 05:17.816
Bah. Just kidding. Muffin?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.985
Are you calling me Muffin
or offering me one?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.353
Either way, no.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.456
Okay. Well, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.757
I think Bayou Sue
sent the letter...

05:25.759 --> 05:28.126
Sorry, what did you say?

05:28.128 --> 05:30.462
Sorry.
Are we in trouble?

05:30.464 --> 05:33.131
No, I just...
Did you say Bayou Sue?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.600
She's just a character in this
book that we're obsessed with.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.169
Yeah,<i> Pepperwood Chronicles. </i>
Anyway, you probably

05:37.171 --> 05:38.704
wouldn't know anything about it.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.208
I put a couple copies in the
library, and the librarian

05:43.210 --> 05:44.943
didn't think it'd go anywhere.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.945
(chuckles) I can't wait to
rub it in Esther's smug face.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.181
That's very flattering.
Please come and
talk to these girls.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.183
They're obsessed
with<i> Pepperwood.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.518
I don't have time for this.
I'm only on page two.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.687
And page one is just
a dedication to Winston.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.689
Ugh. Come on.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.224
The kids used to love
Vice Principal Jess,

05:59.226 --> 06:01.793
and now they won't have anything
to do with Principal Jess.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.496
It's like I'm living in my own
damn adorable shadow.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.199
Please? You-you might get
some ideas from your audience.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.534
My audience is the men
who built this great country.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.969
Your students
would never understand

06:10.971 --> 06:13.839
that<i> Pepperwood's </i>
just a New Orleans story

06:13.841 --> 06:16.508
about a guy fighting
with the alligator within.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.977
Well, could you
just do it for me?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.078
Yeah, I'll-- I mean,
I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.480
Well, then why didn't you--

06:21.482 --> 06:23.382
You know what, I'm happy
with where we ended up,

06:23.384 --> 06:25.784
but you took me on a real
spin around the block there.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.356
So, as you can see here,
I treat Furguson right.
Mm-hmm.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.591
WINSTON: Okay?
Organic kitty litter.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.093
Mm-hmm.
I got the miniature piano,

06:35.095 --> 06:37.095
the tiny, tiny treadmill,

06:37.097 --> 06:39.197
and right over here
is where we do couples yoga.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.032
(gags)

06:41.034 --> 06:43.368
Fish nuggets?
Oh, well, that would explain

06:43.370 --> 06:46.872
his recent oily eliminations,
which I document on the cloud.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.540
You track his poop?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.742
What, you just weigh
his hairballs and clock out?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.577
I mean, I...
Furguson is
happy here, okay?

06:52.579 --> 06:55.180
(voice breaks): Around people
that actually cherish him.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.916
Don't you start, Cece.
And who helped him become
the cat that he is.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.085
Now ain't the time.
I'm sorry, but it's true.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.953
Now ain't the time.
What's happening?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.121
CECE:
I'm trying, okay?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.524
I've just got
to breathe for a second.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.192
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.427
Furguson is my cat.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.195
I found him first.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.696
Well, you may have found
Furguson,

07:11.698 --> 07:13.698
but Sweatshirt found me.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.567
I see you want to play
hardball here. How about this?
Mm-hmm.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.736
We settle things
the way we do on the street.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.737
Mm-hmm.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.038
Catcall.
What?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.907
We let Furguson decide.
Oh, yeah.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.443
Fine. We'll leave the
decision in his paws.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.710
Which are now
incredibly strong,

07:25.712 --> 07:28.413
thanks to his new set
of, uh, mini-dumbbells.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.548
You're welcome.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.782
(chuckling)
Ooh, ooh!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.451
Okay, Pepper-heads!

07:32.453 --> 07:34.553
Get ready for a
memorable experience,

07:34.555 --> 07:36.154
which I hope you will recount
at your weddings,

07:36.156 --> 07:37.456
which I will also be at,

07:37.458 --> 07:38.623
brought to you
by your favorite

07:38.625 --> 07:40.492
principal-slash-friend,
Jessica Day.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.728
Please welcome your favorite
author, Nick Miller!

07:43.730 --> 07:45.096
(girls cheering)
Yay!

07:45.098 --> 07:48.099
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.634
All right, let's
get this over with.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.735
Uh, let's talk
about the book

07:50.737 --> 07:52.304
you guys most certainly
don't understand

07:52.306 --> 07:53.572
because it wasn't
written for you

07:53.574 --> 07:55.006
or people your age.
Go ahead.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.441
The kissing.
OMG, the romance.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.009
The make out scene
at the levee.
Oh, the romance.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.847
Guys!<i> Pepperwood's</i> about way
more than just a romance.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.616
It's... it's, uh, it's
about life, you know?

08:04.618 --> 08:05.750
Race.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.854
The sexualization of
the American handgun.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.655
(whispers): Keep it clean.
Okay.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.191
It's a story about his
ambiguous relationship

08:13.193 --> 08:14.759
with... with justice.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.361
But the romance is amazing.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.662
It made me realize

08:17.664 --> 08:19.431
it doesn't matter
if I'm straight or gay;

08:19.433 --> 08:20.499
I'm just me.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.934
You got that from my book?

08:22.936 --> 08:24.870
That's-- yeah.
That was positive.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.706
Do you think that's because
of the gay dog character?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.040
Yeah.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.809
What I really
respect about that is

08:30.811 --> 08:32.878
it's never mentioned
that he's a gay dog.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.480
But you got that
from the writing.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.015
And that's pretty dope.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.884
You write female desire
so well.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.486
Thank you.
That's okay to say, right?

08:41.488 --> 08:42.888
Yah, Ramona.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.322
I'm-I'm just like you.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.991
I'm your princi-pal.
I'm your friend.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.792
I like to just throw on
my rollerblades,

08:47.794 --> 08:49.561
and just go out there and think.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.695
NICK:
Can I ask you guys

08:50.697 --> 08:52.797
about the scene
in the fish morgue?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.733
Oh, my God, that was
my favorite chapter.
Mine, too.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.701
I read it, like, five times.
Yeah, same!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.203
(mouthing)

08:58.205 --> 09:00.205
What?
I stayed up all night.
It was such a good chapter.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.840
Thank you.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.175
Oh, yeah. You're welcome.
Why'd you whisper it?

09:04.177 --> 09:07.012
Jeremy, I'm just gonna go grab
a coffee, and then I will...

09:07.014 --> 09:08.313
Dark roast, soy creamer,
160 degrees.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.582
How was your lunch, sir?
Disappointing.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.884
Why don't you eat the homemade
bucatini I brought for myself?

09:13.687 --> 09:16.855
Well, thank you, Jeremy.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.824
Um, you know,
I'm not getting

09:19.826 --> 09:22.928
e-mails on my...
(phone beeps)

09:22.930 --> 09:24.763
I just got an e-mail
on my phone.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.164
It's from you.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.734
"Subject: Your e-mail is
now working." All right.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.836
Well, Jeremy, I'm just gonna
go enjoy this bucatini

09:31.838 --> 09:34.506
and, uh, organize
the Peterson account.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.542
I did it already.
You did?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.844
Okay. I guess I'll just...

09:39.846 --> 09:40.979
Enjoy your lunch.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.517
Yeah.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.796
So you're saying that Lady
Diamante doesn't realize

09:57.798 --> 10:00.098
that it's Pepperwood's
underwear for years later,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.933
like, 20 years later?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.603
Maybe she never realizes.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.971
Yes. That's what
I was gonna say, too.

10:05.973 --> 10:06.905
We-- You and me,
we're right here.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.906
All right.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.140
(school bell rings)

10:09.142 --> 10:10.942
Wow. This is incredible.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.445
I mean, so many
great ideas here.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.980
It feels like maybe
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles</i>

10:14.982 --> 10:16.615
could be, like,
a whole series.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.250
Well, I mean, it's called
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles,</i>

10:19.252 --> 10:21.820
so I assumed there'd be
more than one.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.622
Yeah, well, I can't
thank you guys enough.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.956
All right, I'll
see you at home.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.958
Home? You guys
live together?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.094
Yeah, we're roommates.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.895
Yeah. This job
doesn't pay very much,

10:30.897 --> 10:32.497
but it's very rewarding
to hang out

10:32.499 --> 10:33.999
with cool people
like you guys.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.600
You guys are actually,
like, friends?

10:35.602 --> 10:37.068
You ready to get your
mind really blown off?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.103
We used to date.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.804
(girls exclaiming)
Oh, yeah.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.007
Like, a whole thing.
Oh, yeah, we were in love.
Oh, my God.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.008
Everything, yeah.
For a while. (chuckles)

10:43.010 --> 10:44.676
All right, I'll
see you at home.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.144
Yeah, it was crazy.
See you, guys.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.014
Wow. You went from
kind of "meh" to sort of cool

10:49.016 --> 10:51.016
to totally the coolest ever.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.684
I don't want to freak you out,

10:52.686 --> 10:54.619
but that really means
a lot to me.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.254
All right, let's get to class.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.355
Let's get a
picture with PJ.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.957
Uh, what? PJ?

10:58.959 --> 10:59.958
(camera clicks)

10:59.960 --> 11:02.060
Yeah, Principal Jess.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.963
Much as I'd love

11:04.965 --> 11:06.565
to foster your creativity,

11:06.566 --> 11:08.166
I think maybe Principal Jess
or Principal Day...

11:08.168 --> 11:09.668
Let's not even go to class.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.936
(laughter)

11:11.938 --> 11:14.272
Let's go to the drama room
and dress up like old men.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.273
PJ don't care.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.442
Oh, PJ do care. PJ do care.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.110
I mean, your principal
does care.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.812
How about we write a report
on<i> Pepperwood?</i>

11:20.814 --> 11:23.114
You're hilarious.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.783
Yeah. You know I'm serious
about the report.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.051
Don't walk away from me.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.719
Okay. Well, walk away.
Just turn to the left.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.121
Point me out to your friends.
Laugh a, laugh a little bit.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.056
Okay. Yeah. Keep going.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.624
All right,
I've totally lost control.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.862
Ugh! Damn it!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.964
Nick, I have to
get to school!

11:39.966 --> 11:41.066
I know. So do I.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.467
I can't wait
to pitch those girls

11:42.469 --> 11:44.069
my<i> Pepperwood</i> prequel.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.304
It opens with a very graphic
description of his birth.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.406
It's like a dark
<i> Look Who's Talking.</i>

11:48.408 --> 11:50.542
No, no, no, no, Nick. You're not
coming back to school with me.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.077
You made me look way too cool.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.645
The girls told
the whole school.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.313
I've lost all my authority.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.549
(lively music playing,
kids whooping)

11:59.086 --> 12:00.418
This is my office.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.053
I got invited to that, too.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.589
The girls asked me to deejay
at their dance party.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.424
They call me DJ PJ.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.826
They love you.
Isn't that what you wanted?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.494
Ah, it's a tricky balance.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.529
I don't want to be the heavy,
but I need them to listen.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.997
Those girls have
such good ideas.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.432
I've got to put the genie
back in the bottle.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.868
(phone vibrates)
Ugh! See, this is what I mean.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.603
They added me to a text chain
about who has

12:18.605 --> 12:20.438
the cutest butt in school.
And?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.873
It's Nurse Mike.
Interesting.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.342
You know what? If it's
always gonna be empty,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.177
let's just fill
it with goldfish.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.378
So dramatic.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.347
(phone chimes)

12:33.854 --> 12:36.955
Jeremy texted me and he left
an ice coffee in the fridge.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.958
It's like this guy's in my mind.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.595
It's also like he's in our
kitchen when we're sleeping.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.998
(clicking tongue)

12:52.105 --> 12:53.238
Can I come help you pack?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.973
Jeremy's done everything
around here.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.542
Actually, I'm not packing,
I'm just, uh,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.277
hanging out with Winston.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.546
I'm so bored, Cece, please.
I'm desperate.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.947
Are you guys having
one of those mess-downs?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.382
I could come be part of that.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.551
Sir, I believe the correct term
is "mess-around."

13:06.553 --> 13:07.585
Okay. Jeremy, enough.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.154
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.755
That'll be all.
Thank you.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.423
Thank you, thank you.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.392
(sighs)

13:14.394 --> 13:15.460
JEREMY:
Did you say something?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.795
Jer-Jeremy!

13:16.797 --> 13:19.230
Enough! Dear Lord.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.999
You know, I wanted an assistant
that was gonna anticipate

13:21.001 --> 13:22.901
my every need
so I wouldn't have to yell,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.736
but now I'm yelling,
because I have an assistant

13:24.738 --> 13:27.071
that's anticipating my
every need, and I can't breathe!

13:28.141 --> 13:30.141
Work isn't everything, man.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.144
Just... go meet yourself a girl.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.647
Or a, or a man.
I don't know what you're into.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.248
You're very hard
to read sexually.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.616
But please, Jeremy.
That'll be all.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.617
Thank you.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.686
Sorry, sir.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.121
WINSTON and CECE:
Furguson.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.322
Hey, boy.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.025
Sweatshirt. Sweatshirt. Whee!
Furgie.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.526
Ah, there we go.
There we go. Hey, yeah.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.495
Hey, remember all of
the good times we had?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.463
So may good times.
Huh?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.365
WINSTON: What about one of those
times we wore the same shirt?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.667
CECE:
Custom shirts.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.635
(laughs)
Dad of the year.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.604
Dad of the year.
GIL: Come on, Sweatshirt.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.706
Hey, what about the time that
we geeked out on mayonnaise?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.676
Or how 'bout when we drove
to the airport and kissed,

14:04.678 --> 14:06.678
watching the planes
take off. Remember that?
You did what?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.180
She's moving.
She's moving closer.
No, no, no. If you're moving,

14:09.182 --> 14:10.648
then we get to come closer, too.
Yeah. We're coming closer, too.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.183
Sweatshirt...

14:12.185 --> 14:13.017
Hey, boy.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.652
Furguson.
(sniffing)

14:14.654 --> 14:16.020
What?
I don't know.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.789
Someone has crab
in their pocket.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.724
Oh, my God, that's insane.
Yeah, time-out.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.558
(sniffing continues)
That's totally crazy.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.660
Excuse... Okay...

14:22.662 --> 14:24.963
Okay, just...
(gasps)

14:24.965 --> 14:26.798
Cheater!
Oh.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.302
Okay, well, that is from
a salad I had earlier,

14:31.304 --> 14:34.305
and it must've just
fallen into my pocket.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.741
Cece.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.743
I can't believe
you did this.

14:38.745 --> 14:42.046
It's just...

14:42.048 --> 14:44.015
(sighs) Okay.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.485
This is gonna be our last
mess-around before I leave,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.854
and I just don't want Furguson
to leave you, too.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.590
Just because
you stop living together

14:52.592 --> 14:56.060
doesn't mean you stop
caring about somebody.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.263
Because caring--

14:58.265 --> 15:00.265
that is the real mess-around.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.366
Come on.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.800
(crying softly)

15:04.738 --> 15:06.938
Winnie. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie,
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie!
Hmm?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.406
(gasping)
Oh, my God.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.240
(gasps)

15:09.242 --> 15:10.375
WINSTON:
He chose.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.776
Ha!
Yeah.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.878
Ha-ha-ha, you see?
Ha-oh!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.847
The crab claw didn't matter.
Mm-mm.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.048
WINSTON:
Furgie chose.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.250
Outta sight! (laughs)

15:19.252 --> 15:21.853
Come here, my man.
Ah! (laughing)

15:21.855 --> 15:23.621
Aw.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.891
Well, I suppose
what's done is done.

15:26.893 --> 15:27.859
He's all yours.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.694
Good-bye, Sweat...

15:29.696 --> 15:30.762
(sighs)

15:30.764 --> 15:32.330
Good-bye, Furguson.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.968
(chuckles softly)

15:43.476 --> 15:45.109
Do you guys think
it's cool or weird if,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.312
uh, Pepperwood has a peg leg?
Where we at on that?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.913
I'm afraid it might make him
too vulnerable.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.748
I just don't see it that way.
I think it makes--

15:50.750 --> 15:53.284
All right. No peg leg, I guess.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.585
Excuse me! There's
an assembl...

15:54.587 --> 15:58.323
Nick, what the hell
is going on here?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.725
Oh, PJ in the house!

16:00.727 --> 16:03.962
My office. Now.
Oh, PJ's gonna bust somebody.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.263
You're the most in trouble.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.731
But they started it!

16:06.733 --> 16:09.233
I didn't even do any... Gah!

16:13.840 --> 16:15.406
You had an unsupervised
meeting with the students.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.642
You're wearing home slippers
on school grounds.
(scoffs) Home slippers.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.511
You parked in Janitor Margie's
parking spot.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.747
And, by the way, she pissed.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.149
And she ain't small.
It's a dirt patch.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.019
And you ladies, you skipped
an assembly for<i> Pepperwood!</i>

16:28.021 --> 16:29.454
What's the big deal, PJ?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.189
Yeah, you're kind
of being a bitch.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.829
This is unacceptable.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.597
I don't want to be your enemy,

16:39.599 --> 16:41.666
but I also don't need
to be your friend.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.034
So you guys don't get to write

16:43.036 --> 16:45.036
to your international pen pals
for a month.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.839
You've all lost your community
garden privileges.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.142
Two weeks' suspension
from the freestyle poetry slam.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.644
And I'm calling
all of your parents.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.947
Spread the word! Principal Day
is done messing around.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.348
Now get out.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.154
(phone beeps)

17:03.156 --> 17:06.024
Oh, my God, they work fast.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.658
When did they even
take this picture?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.193
Well, apart from
the devil horns,

17:09.195 --> 17:11.095
it's a pretty good picture
of you, Jess.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.998
That's true.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

17:16.002 --> 17:20.371
The truth is is you are exactly
who I was when I was your age.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.242
I was hungry. I was
putting in 22 hours a day.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.011
Once worked four days
straight without water.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.146
Wow.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.748
And I just wish that
somebody had taken me aside

17:30.750 --> 17:33.851
and told me that
there was another way.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.154
Would you have listened?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.588
(sighs)

17:37.590 --> 17:39.590
Probably not.
Then I won't either.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.993
In fact, you're not even
talking to Jeremy right now.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.528
Okay, well,
then who am I talking to?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.163
The younger you,
telling you to take advantage

17:45.165 --> 17:46.998
of your new super cool assistant

17:47.000 --> 17:48.766
so you can get
to the next floor

17:48.768 --> 17:51.502
and the next floor and the next
floor and the next floor

17:51.504 --> 17:54.072
and the next floor
and now we're on top!
And now we're on top!

17:54.074 --> 17:56.007
I'm liking this side
of you, Jeremy.

17:56.009 --> 17:58.176
Yeah, let's stay hungry.
I'm gonna go in there,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.744
I'm gonna work on the
McCormick presentation.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.046
Now I actually am hungry.
Let's order some food.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.082
Already done, sir.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.616
<i> Arigato.</i>

18:05.618 --> 18:07.351
(speaking Japanese)

18:07.353 --> 18:09.921
Take it down a notch.
Yeah.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.258
If you're here to complain
about your punishment,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.360
save your breath.
My decision's final.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.396
Actually, we were just
wondering if we could sit down

18:18.398 --> 18:19.464
with you for a second.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.132
Sure.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.202
We're sorry about being
so disrespectful, Principal Day.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.270
Well, I appreciate that.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.074
If anyone wants a muffin, I...

18:30.076 --> 18:32.410
I have an extra one.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.378
GERTIE:
Here.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.080
We got you a gift card
to a coffee shop.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.149
It's really close to
your route to school.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.384
Well, that's not necessary.
Th-Thank you. That's...

18:40.386 --> 18:42.487
RAMONA: We know you have
a lot of roommates,

18:42.489 --> 18:45.490
and some of them are brilliant
authors working from home,

18:45.492 --> 18:47.492
creating great chronicles.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.894
But they can make
their own coffee.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.930
Well, that feels...
oddly on the nose.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.465
We have the upmost respect
for you.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.602
Sorry, did you just say...

18:57.604 --> 18:59.570
"upmost"?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.441
Oh, that is good.
JESS: Nick!

19:03.443 --> 19:06.777
I can't condone you making
contact with my students.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.946
What?
That said...

19:08.948 --> 19:10.915
thanks for putting them
up to it.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.650
Jess, I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.118
"Upmost"?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.254
There's only one person I know
that says "upmost."

19:16.256 --> 19:17.255
It's "utmost."

19:17.257 --> 19:18.589
"Utmost"?
"Utmost."

19:18.591 --> 19:20.458
(chuckles) Agree to disagree.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.792
But the good news is

19:21.794 --> 19:24.996
my writer's block is gone,
and that is thanks to you.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.999
You always come through for me,
Jess, to the upmost.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.634
I assure you, it's "utmost."

19:29.636 --> 19:31.536
What's an "ut"?
Come on, you're a writer.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.871
It's "up." Up to the most.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.174
Not ut to the most.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.475
I assure<i> you.</i>

19:37.477 --> 19:39.610
Okay, sweetie.
You didn't come in here and say,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.546
"Thanks for putting them
<i> ut</i> to it."

19:41.548 --> 19:43.714
I would've laughed you
out of here.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.716
What is an "ut"?!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.118
WINSTON:
<i> Furguson is miserable.</i>

19:47.120 --> 19:49.353
JESS: So you're saying
that this is

19:49.355 --> 19:52.657
a different emotion than we've
seen for the past three years?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.326
A father knows. He misses Gil.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.528
It'd be wrong for me to take
away a piece of his heart.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.530
I mean, I already took
away his testicles.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.498
Anyway,

20:00.500 --> 20:02.200
(sighs) let me just...

20:04.904 --> 20:07.071
Proud of you.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.575
(sighs)

20:10.577 --> 20:13.344
You won't need the key
I gave you.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.746
And the door
always gonna be open.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.597
You're not gonna, like, leave
the door open always, right?

20:32.599 --> 20:36.100
He'll be back.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.669
What the hell?

20:38.671 --> 20:39.737
Jeremy.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.106
Oh, my God, he came back.
Come on.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.608
What the hell is this man doing
in our house?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.009
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Jeremy.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.210
I'm the executive
assistant

20:46.212 --> 20:48.379
to your husband and
my boss, Mr. Schmidt.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.680
Oh, are you the one
who called

20:49.682 --> 20:51.849
and asked me
about my blood type?
He's very thorough.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.451
Actually, he's going to need
everyone's blood type.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.253
You're not getting my blood.
That's super weird.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.354
Yeah.
Oh, hell no.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.189
I do have
individual coffee orders.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.391
You can tell which one's which
based off the caricatures

21:00.393 --> 21:02.727
I drew on the cups.
That's you.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.863
This is shockingly accurate.
And you've never met us.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.798
Nailed it.
I mean, how did you do that?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.234
Very creepy.
That's pretty good.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.802
(chuckles)

21:11.804 --> 21:13.804
CECE:<i> Is he ever gonna leave? </i>
SCHMIDT:<i> I don't think so.</i>
