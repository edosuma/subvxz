00:56.513 --> 00:58.948
<i>This is the untold true story</i>

00:58.950 --> 01:01.653
<i>of the most famous prince
the world has ever known.</i>

01:01.655 --> 01:03.156
<i>You know him -</i>

01:03.158 --> 01:06.831
<i>always coming to the rescue
of some damsel in distress.</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:09.238
<i>Well, I know him better.</i>

01:10.005 --> 01:11.706
<i>Hey, all he ever wanted</i>

01:11.708 --> 01:14.077
<i>was to make every girl
feel like a princess.</i>

01:14.079 --> 01:15.614
<i>Can you blame him?</i>

01:15.616 --> 01:18.688
<i>When Sleeping Beauty
took a hundred-year nap,</i>

01:18.690 --> 01:21.162
<i>he was there with
a wake-up call.</i>

01:28.375 --> 01:30.110
<i>When Cinderella
needed a partner</i>

01:30.112 --> 01:31.913
<i>toe-to-toe
on the dancefloor,</i>

01:31.915 --> 01:33.553
<i>he was a shoo-in.</i>

01:39.831 --> 01:41.967
<i>When Snow White
bit that poisoned apple,</i>

01:41.969 --> 01:43.641
<i>his kiss was the cure.</i>

01:48.750 --> 01:51.519
<i>But you can have too much
of a good thing.</i>

01:51.521 --> 01:54.559
<i>And that's exactly what
got him into this mess.</i>

01:54.561 --> 01:57.063
Mess? I'm just a bit too...

01:57.065 --> 01:59.301
..charming, that's all.

01:59.303 --> 02:01.907
How we doing?
You got my good side?

02:01.909 --> 02:04.713
Trick question.
They're both my good side.

02:04.715 --> 02:07.050
Well, at least
that's what they tell me.

02:07.052 --> 02:09.420
Come on, this is
for your wedding portrait.

02:09.423 --> 02:11.458
Give me a smile
like a man in love.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.632
Love? I wish I even knew
what that meant.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.871
Well, then,
how did you meet your princess?

02:16.873 --> 02:20.244
Ah, yes, it was a moment
I will never forget.

02:20.246 --> 02:22.949
Ooh. Which princess
do you mean exactly?

02:30.166 --> 02:32.869
Cinderella! Sleeping Beauty!
Snow White!

02:32.871 --> 02:36.309
All three princesses!
Welcome to Frazelli's!

02:36.311 --> 02:38.881
I need a wedding cake!

02:38.883 --> 02:41.654
We make the finest wedding
cakes in the four kingdoms.

02:41.656 --> 02:43.190
I hope so.

02:43.192 --> 02:44.826
Nobody's going to
snooze at my ball.

02:44.828 --> 02:46.361
Except maybe me.

02:46.363 --> 02:47.965
I'm marrying a prince.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.841
Yeah, I'm sure he's a prince
of a guy or whatever,

02:51.843 --> 02:54.512
but my beloved,
he's an actual prince.

02:54.514 --> 02:55.948
Sing it to some birds who care.

02:55.950 --> 02:58.553
Can we get on with this?
My wedding is really soon.

02:58.555 --> 03:00.725
- How soon?
- Oh, careful!

03:00.727 --> 03:03.195
You frown too much and
you'll get wicked witch eyes!

03:03.197 --> 03:04.633
And your mirror will tell you -

03:04.635 --> 03:06.870
he'll tell you
right to your face.

03:06.872 --> 03:08.372
Ladies, ladies!

03:08.374 --> 03:10.577
In 40 years, I have learned
that no two cakes

03:10.579 --> 03:12.681
and no two grooms are alike.

03:12.683 --> 03:15.253
So, each of you,
tell me something

03:15.255 --> 03:18.159
about the man
who has enchanted you so.

Hey! Papa! What a morning!

Oh, son!

06:03.325 --> 06:06.529
Aren't you tired of being hated

06:06.531 --> 06:08.667
by every man in the land?

06:08.669 --> 06:11.371
Curse that cursed curse!

06:11.373 --> 06:13.978
The prince stole my love!

06:13.980 --> 06:17.518
Yeah. I have been trying to run
away from the ladies, though.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.153
Mmm!

06:19.155 --> 06:20.857
Just like you asked, Papa.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.162
You don't know
how troubling this curse is.

06:23.164 --> 06:27.471
I am attempting to run a kingdom
here! Of course I do!

06:27.473 --> 06:29.809
Philippe,
you are the future king

06:29.811 --> 06:32.013
and yet you still have not
chosen a bride!

06:33.685 --> 06:36.690
Your blasted curse
must be broken

06:36.692 --> 06:39.395
and we've only three days
before your 21st birthday.

06:39.397 --> 06:43.570
I'm engaged to Sleeping Beauty,
Cinderella and Snow White.

06:43.572 --> 06:45.073
Then just pick one!

06:45.075 --> 06:48.346
That's not love. I don't know
the meaning of the word.

06:48.348 --> 06:49.783
Seriously, what is it?

06:49.785 --> 06:52.354
The day has come for you
to run the gauntlet.

06:52.356 --> 06:55.225
- The gauntlet?
- The rite of passage.

06:55.227 --> 06:57.331
All the way to Fire Mountain.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.569
It will give you
the answers you seek

06:59.571 --> 07:01.840
as it did for me
and my father before me.

07:01.842 --> 07:05.012
The gauntlet is a journey
that makes you a man.

07:05.014 --> 07:09.220
It led me to the Latin beauty
that became my true love.

07:09.222 --> 07:11.124
May your mother rest in peace.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.929
Unfortunately, that's also

07:12.931 --> 07:15.299
when I broke the heart
of my trusted guide.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.236
You mean
Nemeny Neverwish?

07:17.238 --> 07:20.477
She was
so jealous of our love.

07:20.479 --> 07:22.648
Nemeny became our enemy,

07:22.650 --> 07:24.986
consumed in dark fairy magic.

07:24.988 --> 07:28.059
She vowed revenge
not just on me

07:28.061 --> 07:30.265
but on love itself.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.704
I'll never forget
the day it all happened,

07:33.706 --> 07:36.612
the day of your royal blessing.

07:48.536 --> 07:53.009
Presenting
the royal blessing fairy!

08:02.062 --> 08:03.763
Your Excellency,

08:03.765 --> 08:06.402
it is my honour to bestow
the royal blessing

08:06.404 --> 08:07.839
upon the young prince

08:07.841 --> 08:11.480
as I blessed you
and your father before you.

08:11.482 --> 08:13.684
For you, my tiny lord!

08:13.686 --> 08:15.821
From this day forth

08:15.823 --> 08:17.624
you shall always be...

08:17.626 --> 08:19.631
..charming!

08:22.837 --> 08:25.641
Oh! Ohh!

08:25.643 --> 08:27.477
Too much charm!

08:27.479 --> 08:29.482
Nemeny Neverwish?

08:29.484 --> 08:32.186
You seem so surprised, Philip.

08:32.188 --> 08:34.592
I did promise I'd be back.

08:34.594 --> 08:36.059
What have you done?

08:36.062 --> 08:39.835
Oh, how they will throw
themselves at your boy now.

08:39.837 --> 08:42.407
He'll be a little heartbreaker,

08:42.409 --> 08:45.112
just like his daddy.

08:45.114 --> 08:47.017
In fact...

08:47.019 --> 08:50.958
..no maiden who gazes
into the eyes of the prince

08:50.960 --> 08:54.063
will be able to
resist his smile.

08:54.065 --> 08:58.405
She will believe that
the prince is her true love.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.410
One by one,

09:00.412 --> 09:04.819
he will steal the heart of
every maiden in the land.

09:04.821 --> 09:08.159
Heartbreak will reign.

09:08.161 --> 09:12.433
And when the sun sets
on his 21st birthday,

09:12.435 --> 09:15.172
this charming curse
will be sealed

09:15.174 --> 09:19.113
and on that day,
all love will disappear

09:19.115 --> 09:20.551
forever!

09:20.553 --> 09:23.155
No! I will find a way
to break your curse!

09:23.157 --> 09:28.332
It could be broken on the last
day with a kiss of true love.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.103
- Guards!
- Your Highness!

09:30.105 --> 09:32.009
Seize her!

09:33.512 --> 09:35.013
Seize what?

09:35.015 --> 09:37.718
Bless you!
Now, don't freak out!

09:37.720 --> 09:40.156
He's got 21 years
to find true love's kiss.

09:40.158 --> 09:43.161
- But how?
- It can't be that hard.

09:43.163 --> 09:46.402
He's a prince!
And he's covered in charm.

09:46.404 --> 09:49.709
Oh, with every lady in the land
throwing themselves at him,

09:49.711 --> 09:51.378
will he ever know the difference

09:51.380 --> 09:53.583
between the curse
and real love?

09:53.585 --> 09:56.087
We've been over this
so many times, Papa.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.191
I still have a few days
to consider my options.

09:58.193 --> 10:01.298
We're out of options.
I can't do this for you.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.670
You've got to do it
for yourself, Philippe.

10:03.672 --> 10:06.910
<i>For myself? How?</i>

10:06.912 --> 10:09.649
<i>How can I tell Papa
that I'm scared?</i>

10:09.651 --> 10:11.719
<i>How can I go out there and find</i>

10:11.721 --> 10:13.557
<i>something I don't even
understand?</i>

10:13.559 --> 10:15.693
<i>True love?</i>

10:15.695 --> 10:18.431
<i>Every girl I've ever met
was hypnotised.</i>

10:18.433 --> 10:21.872
- <i>That's not love.</i>
- <i>It's meaningless.</i>

10:21.874 --> 10:23.943
<i>Meaningless!</i>

10:23.945 --> 10:25.780
<i>There's a big echo in my head!</i>

10:25.782 --> 10:28.219
<i>I had no idea there was
this much room in here!</i>

10:28.221 --> 10:30.991
<i>Uh... what is he doing
with my chair?</i>

10:30.993 --> 10:33.963
All you need is a little push.

10:33.965 --> 10:36.735
For the sake of the kingdom!

10:36.737 --> 10:40.879
And do not return
until you choose a wife!

10:42.684 --> 10:44.852
Things you do for love!

10:44.854 --> 10:47.456
Alright, let's go gauntlet-ing!

10:47.458 --> 10:49.361
It's gonna be...

10:49.363 --> 10:51.832
..gaunt-tastic!

11:11.674 --> 11:13.912
Whoa!

11:19.524 --> 11:21.225
You! Clear the road!

11:21.227 --> 11:24.500
The rest of you, stay alert.
This could take a while.

One, two, three!

12:35.542 --> 12:37.811
Fine. 40%.

12:41.855 --> 12:43.789
Oh, just get Charlie,

12:52.543 --> 12:54.812
Wow!

You there! Thief!

12:56.250 --> 12:57.884
Stop! It's her!

14:19.784 --> 14:24.625

or all love will die,

14:26.263 --> 14:28.765
and darkness will consume
the land forevermore.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.404
Piece of cake!

14:31.172 --> 14:33.141
No, no, I actually want
a piece of cake.

14:33.143 --> 14:34.812
Apologies, my lord.

14:34.814 --> 14:36.781
Mmm!

14:36.783 --> 14:39.688
Ah, my Arabian princess.

14:39.690 --> 14:41.223
Your genie has appeared.

14:41.225 --> 14:43.495
My camel awaits and...

14:43.497 --> 14:47.269
It's not for you!
Gladys, got your note.

14:47.271 --> 14:48.238
Wha-ho!

14:48.240 --> 14:49.875
But I want you to see, um...

14:49.877 --> 14:51.411
Over here.

14:51.413 --> 14:53.949
See other people,
in any direction!

14:53.951 --> 14:56.253
Oh, I really can't
dance right now,

14:56.255 --> 14:57.890
but your moves, so consistent.

14:57.892 --> 15:00.029
- Charming!
- Hey, look at you!

15:00.031 --> 15:01.831
I'm really in a time crunch,
so maybe... never?

15:03.370 --> 15:07.343
Oh, didn't we just meet last
week? Yeah, that got funny, huh?

15:07.345 --> 15:10.749
You don't need a
princess, you need a good cook.

15:10.751 --> 15:12.286
Meet me at The Dainty Dish!

15:12.288 --> 15:14.791
- What? Come back!
- Hey!

15:14.793 --> 15:16.762
- Coming through!
- Out of the way!

15:16.764 --> 15:19.166
I know she's around here
somewhere.

15:22.843 --> 15:24.978
Whoa!

15:24.980 --> 15:26.514
Huh!

15:26.516 --> 15:29.087
<i>Dressed for adventure!</i>

15:29.089 --> 15:30.990
<i>Those eyes!</i>

15:30.992 --> 15:33.428
<i>I need to say something.
Say something!</i>

15:33.430 --> 15:34.864
Flayberby flobby!

15:34.866 --> 15:36.936
<i>What was that?! Try again.</i>

15:36.938 --> 15:38.872
- Face like a mermaid.
- <i>No!</i>

15:38.874 --> 15:40.309
Voice of a meerkat!

15:40.311 --> 15:43.081
My brain is a bottle!
Butter on pancakes!

15:43.083 --> 15:44.884
<i>What is happening?</i>

15:44.886 --> 15:46.521
<i>I can't put a sentence together.</i>

15:46.523 --> 15:48.593
<i>And why do my knees
feel like paella?</i>

15:48.595 --> 15:51.464
<i>Where's that super charm,
and why isn't it working?</i>

15:51.466 --> 15:53.603
<i>Say something that makes sense!</i>

15:53.605 --> 15:57.743
Very nice, my lady!
This is nice. And so are we!

15:59.014 --> 16:02.019
Um, I think you might
have hit your head.

16:02.021 --> 16:03.454
I'm probably stressed.

16:03.456 --> 16:05.626
Nemeny Neverwish, a dark fairy

16:05.628 --> 16:08.297
at war with love itself,
threatens our land.

16:08.299 --> 16:10.402
But if I run the gauntlet
and figure out

16:10.404 --> 16:12.139
which of my
three fiancées to marry,

16:12.141 --> 16:13.942
I'll take a vow and save us all!

16:13.944 --> 16:16.047
Did you say you're engaged
to three women?

16:16.049 --> 16:17.584
Look, it's not like
I planned it, OK?

16:17.586 --> 16:19.855
I've got a charm
that just won't let go.

16:19.857 --> 16:22.694
- Um...
- It's such a curse.

16:24.432 --> 16:27.838
Well, you should try
letting go more often.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.875
Thanks for the dance, fella!

16:29.877 --> 16:31.376
Wait!

16:31.378 --> 16:34.352
That was the weirdest feeling.

16:37.124 --> 16:40.098
Uh-oh!

16:47.010 --> 16:48.712
Oh, no!

16:48.714 --> 16:52.686
No-one steps on this side of
Frazelli's counter unless...

16:52.688 --> 16:55.092
- Have you seen this woman?
- I don't think so. Sorry!

16:55.094 --> 16:57.061
Uh...

16:57.063 --> 16:58.765
Sorry!

16:58.767 --> 17:02.807
Come on!

17:02.809 --> 17:05.546
Phew!

17:10.893 --> 17:12.696
Whoa!

17:13.865 --> 17:16.201
Hello?! Is anyone here?

17:16.203 --> 17:19.473
Oh, I didn't hear
you girls come in!

17:19.476 --> 17:21.578
We all need our wedding cakes.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.816
We're just adding
the final touches.

17:23.818 --> 17:26.420
So, blondie, tell me.

17:26.422 --> 17:30.062
How'd you and your, um,
true love first meet?

17:30.064 --> 17:31.664
Well, I don't have much time

17:31.666 --> 17:33.502
but my father married
a complete psycho.

17:33.504 --> 17:36.174
She had him killed and
then turned me into the maid.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.111
Oooh! I did floors!

17:38.113 --> 17:40.482
Well, conveniently,
I had a fairy godmother,

17:40.484 --> 17:42.553
even though she had never
shown her face once

17:42.555 --> 17:45.493
in the years and years I lived
in the fireplace of my own home.

17:45.495 --> 17:47.997
What did she do? Make
a call to Child Services?

17:47.999 --> 17:50.769
She did show up the night of
the big ball at the castle

17:50.771 --> 17:53.509
and she gave me some really
nice clothes, a fancy ride,

17:53.511 --> 17:56.782
and some gorgeous, though
incredibly uncomfortable, shoes.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.552
Ooh! I like shoes.

17:58.554 --> 18:01.156
Now I have to worry about
the arbitrary midnight deadline

18:01.158 --> 18:02.594
of my fairy godmother's magic.

18:02.596 --> 18:05.431
Oh, thank goodness my future
husband managed to find me

18:05.433 --> 18:08.806
because I am apparently the
only girl in my entire kingdom

18:08.808 --> 18:10.208
with a size-6.5 foot.

18:10.210 --> 18:13.616
Wow! That is one seriously
messed-up story.

18:13.618 --> 18:17.422
So, you with skin
as white as snow, you're up.

18:17.424 --> 18:19.093
How'd you meet your prince?

18:19.095 --> 18:20.930
You're a stranger,
so don't touch me.

18:20.932 --> 18:23.668
My evil stepmother
tried to kill me.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.341
Ugh. Evil stepmothers
are the worst.

18:26.343 --> 18:28.746
And then,
seven tiny little bearded men

18:28.748 --> 18:29.981
who work underground

18:29.983 --> 18:33.053
left me in a glass coffin
in the middle of the woods.

18:33.055 --> 18:34.725
OK, that's kind of weird.

18:34.727 --> 18:38.801
Anyways, that's when my sweet,
charming prince found me...

18:40.271 --> 18:42.907
..and kissed me
and brought me back to life.

18:42.909 --> 18:46.080
I'm sorry, his kiss
brought you back to life?

18:46.082 --> 18:48.317
Yeah! Good old mouth-to-mouth.

18:48.319 --> 18:50.589
You know, you're all kind of
freaking me out.

18:50.591 --> 18:53.528
And yet, with morbid curiosity,
I can only wonder

18:53.530 --> 18:55.866
what your lips will spout.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.537
On my 16th birthday,

18:57.539 --> 19:00.475
I pricked my finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel

19:00.477 --> 19:02.413
even though I was,
like, totally warned

19:02.415 --> 19:04.650
that if I ever touched a spindle
I'd fall asleep forever.

19:04.652 --> 19:08.258
Oh, my! That's a very...
specific curse.

19:08.260 --> 19:09.627
Right?!

19:09.629 --> 19:13.400
Anyway, the fairies who raised
me in a hut in the forest

19:13.402 --> 19:15.940
totally put my entire
kingdom to sleep.

19:15.942 --> 19:18.444
- Why, exactly?
- I don't know.

19:18.446 --> 19:22.351
Anyway, we all slept
for a hundred years.

19:22.353 --> 19:25.191
That's when my very own
amazing prince

19:25.193 --> 19:27.128
found me passed out
on the floor.

19:27.130 --> 19:29.800
And he did what
anyone else would do.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.236
He called for a doctor?

19:31.238 --> 19:33.240
He pretended he didn't see you
and walked away

19:33.242 --> 19:34.878
so he didn't have to deal?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.781
No. He kissed me.

19:36.783 --> 19:39.553
And five seconds later,
we were engaged.

19:39.555 --> 19:41.524
- Oh!
- And soon I'll be crowned.

19:41.526 --> 19:42.960
Huh?

19:42.962 --> 19:44.931
Must be three lucky men!

19:44.933 --> 19:46.567
Who's got a picture?

19:46.569 --> 19:49.576
♪ My trophy boy! ♪

19:51.446 --> 19:54.550
Are you guys hoping to
marry the same prince?

20:00.497 --> 20:03.234
Well, ladies, what can I say,

20:03.236 --> 20:05.705
besides thanks for sharing,
best of luck.

20:05.707 --> 20:07.545
And you know what?
Maybe try therapy.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.967
Huh! Weird.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.305
How'd that get there?

20:22.307 --> 20:23.741
Ow!

20:23.743 --> 20:26.379
Medieval crimes
in medieval times!

20:26.381 --> 20:28.251
Sleeping Beauty robbed!

20:28.253 --> 20:29.888
King Beauty to prosecute.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.390
Cinderella robbed!

20:31.392 --> 20:33.428
Fairy godmother flummoxed!

20:33.430 --> 20:34.864
Snow White robbed!

20:34.866 --> 20:36.867
Cranky, founding dwarf of
the Hi-Ho Mining Company,

20:36.869 --> 20:38.303
to press charges.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.807
Scandal!

20:39.809 --> 20:41.911
All three ripped-off royals
engaged to the same prince!

20:41.913 --> 20:43.381
How? Why?

20:43.383 --> 20:44.850
Hear ye, hear ye!

20:44.852 --> 20:46.588
Charming to run
the legendary gauntlet.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.725
Forecast for survival? Cloudy!

20:48.727 --> 20:51.765
Merlin's Mattress Warehouse
is having a sale!

20:51.767 --> 20:53.468
Prices - insane!

20:59.682 --> 21:01.951
Yep, that's her,
the baker burglar.

21:01.953 --> 21:03.588
I'm gonna lie down.

21:03.590 --> 21:07.164
Being robbed by strangers?
It's safer in the woods.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.401
So we've trapped you,

21:10.403 --> 21:13.207
the thief who's stolen
the treasure from my guards.

21:13.209 --> 21:16.012
My apologies, but...
you make it easy.

21:16.014 --> 21:17.649
- She's stealing my prince.
- Daddy, he's mine!

21:17.651 --> 21:19.754
Yes, dears. I'm working on it!

21:19.756 --> 21:21.591
And I thought I had problems!

21:21.593 --> 21:23.294
The Charming curse!

21:23.296 --> 21:25.965
Well, it's one tough
enchantment, isn't it?

21:25.967 --> 21:27.870
Dark magic from Neverwish.

21:27.872 --> 21:31.046
It's hard to break that spell,
but I'll do my best!

21:34.719 --> 21:37.689
Huh?

21:37.691 --> 21:39.760
What?

21:39.762 --> 21:43.935
Oh, don't worry, it'll turn back
next time the clock strikes 12.

21:43.937 --> 21:47.642
Ticking clock magic's hardly
magic at all, is what it is.

21:47.644 --> 21:49.514
That prince is running
the gauntlet.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.617
- Oooh! Poor dear.
- I know.

21:51.619 --> 21:54.757
I've seen some guys twice
his size never survive that one.

21:54.759 --> 21:56.762
At least you have a picture
to remember him.

21:56.764 --> 21:58.998
Well, if he's killed,
nobody marries, do they?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.538
Wait a minute -
could there be a way

22:01.540 --> 22:03.406
that we could come to
a little arrangement?

22:03.408 --> 22:04.843
Instead of... jail?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.715
I guess I could be convinced.

22:06.717 --> 22:11.991
Hmm. Thief, you will
protect this prince.

22:11.993 --> 22:13.861
Me? Fine!

22:13.863 --> 22:15.098
You turn me loose,

22:15.100 --> 22:17.102
I get your prince
through the gauntlet alive.

22:17.104 --> 22:18.538
But I don't come cheap.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.542
It'll cost a fortune in gold.

22:20.544 --> 22:23.514
Perhaps three golden fortunes
would suffice?

22:23.516 --> 22:26.352
Now we have a deal.
Three horse carts full.

22:26.354 --> 22:28.825
No promissory notes,
payments in cash only.

22:28.827 --> 22:30.895
So I just get him
to Fire Mountain?

22:30.897 --> 22:33.537
That's
where we make him pick a bride.

22:36.107 --> 22:38.982
I'll get him to Fire Mountain
in three days.

22:43.389 --> 22:44.991
You take the main road
ahead of us

22:44.993 --> 22:47.394
while I guide the prince
through a safer route.

22:47.396 --> 22:49.767
Think of it as gaunt-lite.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.704
And I'm on wanted posters
all over town,

22:51.706 --> 22:53.440
so I'll be in disguise.

22:53.442 --> 22:55.848
Three days.

22:56.650 --> 22:58.719
Agreed! Where did she go?

22:58.721 --> 23:02.061
Hey! She stole my moustache!

23:23.536 --> 23:26.508
Heard
you were running the gauntlet.

23:26.510 --> 23:29.245
You'll need a trusted guide
to make it through.

23:29.247 --> 23:30.749
Lucky for you,

23:30.751 --> 23:33.219
I know my way around
every part of the gauntlet.

23:33.221 --> 23:35.793
You know, like a gauntlet guide.

23:35.795 --> 23:37.797
Well, I was thinking of hiring

23:37.799 --> 23:39.800
one of these ruffians
to guide me through it.

23:39.802 --> 23:41.870
This one was
a little too aggressive.

23:41.872 --> 23:43.842
A real pain in the... ahem!

23:43.844 --> 23:46.480
But she certainly was immune
to all of my charms.

23:46.482 --> 23:47.916
Tell me,

23:47.918 --> 23:50.621
could you imagine travelling
with someone like this?

23:50.623 --> 23:54.264
Nope! Never, ever, ever, ever.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.968
You're lucky.

23:56.970 --> 23:59.639
Life on the open road
can make you a little bit crazy.

23:59.641 --> 24:01.075
You said you were a guide?

24:01.077 --> 24:03.849
More like THE guide!
Already headed that way.

24:03.851 --> 24:07.021
Prince Philippe Charming.

24:07.023 --> 24:08.456
And I'm Len...

24:08.458 --> 24:10.696
Um...

24:10.698 --> 24:12.465
I'm Lenny.

24:12.467 --> 24:16.076
Yup, Lenny's my name!

24:18.245 --> 24:19.549
We leave at once!

24:41.357 --> 24:43.027
So, Lenny...

24:43.029 --> 24:44.462
What's for supper?

24:44.464 --> 24:46.266
- Excuse me?
- Supper.

24:46.268 --> 24:49.138
The meal that comes
after lunch, before bed.

24:49.140 --> 24:50.575
What are we having?

24:50.577 --> 24:53.615
Why don't you tell me?

24:53.617 --> 24:56.521
Oh, oh. Oh, awkward. Uh, I...

24:56.523 --> 24:58.992
I assumed
you picked up on it already.

24:58.994 --> 25:01.295
Um, I am...

25:01.297 --> 25:02.932
..a prince.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.368
You know.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.072
So, um...

25:06.074 --> 25:08.777
Oh, you're right,
this IS awkward,

25:08.779 --> 25:11.350
because I assumed that
YOU picked up on it already.

25:11.352 --> 25:12.553
I don't care.

25:12.555 --> 25:14.321
Then you suggest I...

25:14.323 --> 25:15.759
What? Fend for myself?

25:15.761 --> 25:17.495
Only if you're hungry,
Your Majesty.

25:17.497 --> 25:18.931
You're mocking me.

25:18.933 --> 25:20.568
Well, you could man up a little.

25:20.570 --> 25:23.173
Oh, of course. You're jealous.

25:23.175 --> 25:24.976
Of you?!

25:24.978 --> 25:27.783
I am a prince on a noble quest.

25:27.785 --> 25:29.653
You are a thief

25:29.655 --> 25:33.830
incapable of loving
anything but... your trinkets.

25:41.980 --> 25:45.519
So, how does one end up
engaged to three princesses?

25:45.521 --> 25:47.388
It is a little bit troubling.

25:49.962 --> 25:51.931
When you're born a prince,

25:51.933 --> 25:53.433
you marry a princess.

25:53.435 --> 25:57.074
I have to find one who truly
loves me to break this curse.

25:57.076 --> 26:00.649
So I just keep proposing to
them, one after another.

26:00.651 --> 26:03.621
You see, you don't steal
their heart, you earn it.

26:03.623 --> 26:06.360
So enlighten me, Señor Suave.

26:06.362 --> 26:09.231
When you save them, why
do you have to marry them?

26:09.233 --> 26:10.736
Are you not listening?

26:10.738 --> 26:12.372
Wait for it.

26:12.374 --> 26:14.208
PRINCE!

26:14.210 --> 26:15.978
So then, no true love?

26:15.980 --> 26:19.385
That will come when I discover
who I am to be with.

26:19.387 --> 26:20.855
So who's in the lead?

26:20.857 --> 26:23.762
It could be the girl with
the glass shoes, Cinderella.

26:23.764 --> 26:26.633
The night we met,
she felt the clock ticking.

26:26.635 --> 26:28.971
But now she takes her time.

26:28.973 --> 26:33.079
- How long is this going to take?
- Uh... a while?

26:33.081 --> 26:36.053
Tick-tock, buddy! It's always
midnight somewhere!

26:36.055 --> 26:37.555
OK!

26:37.557 --> 26:39.794
- I'm no Da Vinci or anything.
- Mm-hm.

26:39.796 --> 26:41.931
Did you know he just invented
a new kind of...

26:41.933 --> 26:44.302
Is he inventing a faster way
to paint a portrait? Huh?

26:44.304 --> 26:47.208
Quick-drying paint?
I've got a fitting in an hour!

26:47.210 --> 26:49.378
So you're willing
to risk your life for her?

26:49.380 --> 26:53.287
I must! True love for
my people is in jeopardy.

26:53.289 --> 26:56.693
The gauntlet consists
of three impossible tasks.

26:56.695 --> 26:57.962
Hmm!

26:57.964 --> 27:01.803
One - cross an impassable pass.

27:01.805 --> 27:04.976
Two - survive
an unsurvivable attack.

27:04.978 --> 27:07.883
The punching and the kicking!

27:07.885 --> 27:11.691
And three - conquer
an unconquerable beast.

27:11.693 --> 27:13.762
- Oooh.
- Now, that's a shadow puppet.

27:13.764 --> 27:15.766
Sounds exhausting.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.402
That's what I said.

27:17.404 --> 27:19.773
Still, can't be worse than

27:19.775 --> 27:21.577
collecting and
hoarding treasure.

27:21.579 --> 27:23.379
Hey, perhaps that's
MY true love.

27:23.381 --> 27:27.287
Not possible. Treasure
can never love you back.

27:27.289 --> 27:28.625
It can never complete you.

27:28.627 --> 27:32.432
Why not? Obtaining it does
meet all of your requirements.

27:32.434 --> 27:35.371
Not all, for there is a fourth
and final requirement.

27:35.373 --> 27:39.348
Both lovers must take a blind
leap of faith for each other.

27:41.652 --> 27:43.286
And since gold coins
and rare baubles

27:43.288 --> 27:44.722
can never do that,

27:44.724 --> 27:46.794
at the end of the day,

27:46.796 --> 27:49.365
if it's just you
and your treasure,

27:49.367 --> 27:51.038
you are alone.

27:52.842 --> 27:54.977
20 years I've waited,

27:54.979 --> 27:57.915
and now it's but
two more sunsets

27:57.917 --> 28:00.221
and the curse is sealed.

28:00.223 --> 28:02.425
Then and only then

28:02.427 --> 28:07.067
will you see the true
devastation of my curse.

28:12.681 --> 28:14.850
So, Lenny, what about you?

28:14.852 --> 28:17.556
Is there a special someone
in your life?

28:17.558 --> 28:19.091
Hah! No.

28:19.093 --> 28:21.730
You and I are cut
from different cloths.

28:21.732 --> 28:23.934
- You could never understand.
- Try me.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.674
Hmm. Well, I grew up
on the open sea,

28:26.676 --> 28:28.578
and it taught me
one consistent lesson.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.214
Trust no-one.

28:30.216 --> 28:32.083
- No-one?
- No-one.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.854
Keeps you alive
and keeps you fed,

28:33.856 --> 28:35.962
but it doesn't earn you
a lot of friends.

28:37.163 --> 28:39.432
Friends?
I've heard of those.

28:39.434 --> 28:41.940
But my father never
appointed any to me.

28:42.775 --> 28:45.376
You, uh, talk in your sleep.
You know that?

28:45.378 --> 28:47.447
I do? What do I say?

28:47.449 --> 28:48.751
You know, I don't know,

28:48.753 --> 28:51.389
but I'm pretty sure you were
being chased by an angry gang.

28:51.391 --> 28:55.196
It's true. A mob chases me
through my dreams at night.

28:55.198 --> 28:57.970
I think the dreams started
when Mama died.

28:57.972 --> 29:00.542
I know they will end
when I find my true love.

29:00.544 --> 29:03.983
And on other nights,
I just dream about pancakes!

29:11.665 --> 29:13.768
Oh... how mysterious!

29:13.770 --> 29:16.842
Whoa!

29:18.312 --> 29:19.849
Aie!

29:24.993 --> 29:28.330
Charlie! What is it, girl?

29:30.537 --> 29:32.508
This isn't right.

29:34.579 --> 29:37.016
What is going on here?

29:44.430 --> 29:46.801
What was that?

29:46.803 --> 29:48.938
- Lenny!
- Hang on!

29:48.940 --> 29:52.314
Whoa! This isn't
gaunt-lite at all!

29:55.821 --> 29:57.956
That almost killed me!

29:57.958 --> 29:59.892
I mean, did you see that?

29:59.894 --> 30:02.699
I know!
The whole valley's alive!

30:02.701 --> 30:05.303
Ok. Have you ever
used a bow before?

30:05.305 --> 30:08.412
- Of course.
- Great. There!

30:11.552 --> 30:13.319
Ugh!

30:13.321 --> 30:16.258
I thought you said
you know how to use a bow!

30:16.260 --> 30:20.299
No, I said I HAD used one,
which I have.

30:20.301 --> 30:21.837
Once.

30:21.839 --> 30:24.475
Ugh! Take the reins!

30:24.477 --> 30:25.911
Um, yeah...

30:25.913 --> 30:28.617
I don't really do
the driving, so...

30:28.619 --> 30:30.086
OK, I'll drive!

30:31.725 --> 30:33.361
- Whoa!
- Ahh!

30:50.428 --> 30:52.263
Whoa! Nice shot!

30:52.265 --> 30:54.636
Whoa!

30:54.638 --> 30:56.206
What are you doing?

30:56.208 --> 30:59.482
I don't know. I've never driven
one of these things before.

31:02.352 --> 31:04.755
Whoa! Whoa!

31:04.757 --> 31:06.394
Argh!

31:07.163 --> 31:09.665
<i>And this is where Charming died.</i>

31:09.667 --> 31:11.336
<i>The end.</i>

31:12.975 --> 31:14.842
<i>Or maybe not!</i>

31:14.844 --> 31:18.048
Whooa!

31:19.153 --> 31:21.125
Ahh!

31:22.894 --> 31:25.899
Um... amazing!

31:25.901 --> 31:28.103
Do you know what that was?

31:28.105 --> 31:30.575
I mean, do you know
what that was?

31:30.577 --> 31:32.611
Yeah, that was
a treasure chest

31:32.613 --> 31:35.249
dropping into a forest
full of killer vines.

31:35.251 --> 31:38.958
It was an impassable
pass! Oh, what a thrill!

31:38.960 --> 31:41.562
Aha! Take that!

31:41.564 --> 31:45.304
Even more thrilling
than if your men did it for you?

31:45.306 --> 31:47.709
I understand what you're
implying and you're right.

31:47.711 --> 31:51.282
I have always been carried
across life's impassable passes

31:51.284 --> 31:53.256
on the shoulders of others.

31:54.223 --> 31:58.128
But today we faced it together
like brothers in arms!

31:58.130 --> 31:59.866
And it was awesome!

31:59.868 --> 32:01.803
Look at me running
that gauntlet,

32:01.805 --> 32:03.708
pursuing my one true love!

32:03.710 --> 32:05.142
It's destiny!

32:05.144 --> 32:07.013
I feel so alive!

32:07.015 --> 32:09.753
And you! You are amazing!

32:09.755 --> 32:11.321
What do you want, a kiss?

32:11.323 --> 32:13.059
- What did you say?
- Kidding!

32:13.061 --> 32:16.231
I'm so male it's, like,
ridiculous, bro!

32:16.233 --> 32:18.002
Like, what a dude I am!

32:18.004 --> 32:20.710
- Right! Yeah! Bro.
- Bro!

32:21.879 --> 32:24.015
You need to teach me
how to use this thing

32:24.017 --> 32:26.552
and the bow and the cart.

32:26.554 --> 32:29.993
Whoa!
Well, maybe not the cart. Um...

32:29.995 --> 32:31.830
But everything else!

32:31.832 --> 32:33.266
Why do you even carry a sword?

32:33.268 --> 32:35.938
Because it looks fantastic.

32:35.940 --> 32:38.810
Take that, scoundrel!

32:38.812 --> 32:41.082
Scoundrel? Really?

32:41.084 --> 32:43.119
OK.

32:43.121 --> 32:44.556
OK, I can't take this anymore.

32:44.558 --> 32:47.226
Look, you'll never vanquish
an enemy like that.

32:47.228 --> 32:50.233
Not even an imaginary one.
Here, let me show you.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.639
Your sword is not an accessory.

32:52.641 --> 32:56.746
So like that smile of yours, be
more careful where you point it.

32:56.748 --> 32:58.385
Like this.

33:01.257 --> 33:03.794
Uh... how does that feel?

33:03.796 --> 33:06.264
Nice. Very nice.

33:06.266 --> 33:09.071
Attack!

33:09.073 --> 33:11.578
Whoa, whoa!

33:16.722 --> 33:20.459
Oh, look, Prince Charming's
actually attempting

33:20.461 --> 33:23.834
to find his way through the
gauntlet and break his curse.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.842
How adorable.

33:28.111 --> 33:30.447
But what's this?

33:30.449 --> 33:33.686
A female travelling companion?

33:33.688 --> 33:37.764
And she's somehow
immune to his charm?

33:38.833 --> 33:40.834
Oh, no!

33:40.836 --> 33:43.676
This will not be tolerated!

33:50.389 --> 33:52.895
Weird. I could have sworn...

33:56.635 --> 33:58.871
Oh, well. I guess
we'll go this way.

33:58.873 --> 34:02.612
So, how well do you even
know these princesses?

34:02.614 --> 34:05.317
Like, uh,
Little Miss Sleepy Head?

34:05.319 --> 34:09.225
Ah, the girl who slept,
who is at last awake.

34:09.226 --> 34:11.563
What I love about Sleeping
Beauty is her energy.

34:11.565 --> 34:14.268
After a hundred-year nap,
she's rejuvenated,

34:14.270 --> 34:17.609
vivacious, ready for life.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.117
Oh, boy.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.386
Hello? Dear?

34:23.388 --> 34:26.190
Did it...
Did it happen again?

34:26.193 --> 34:28.228
Just hold that pose.

34:28.231 --> 34:30.431
What about posing
on a chaise lounge?

34:30.434 --> 34:32.737
Or maybe a bed?

34:32.739 --> 34:34.475
I don't think
that's a good idea.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.713
Or maybe I'm holding a sheep?

34:36.715 --> 34:38.916
Two sheep? Three sheep?

34:38.918 --> 34:41.725
Ugh! Again?!

34:42.493 --> 34:45.462
Of course,
I could be wrong.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.366
You know what might help us?

34:47.368 --> 34:50.306
This gadget my inventors
showed me called a compass.

34:50.308 --> 34:52.777
Wherever you go,
the needle points to north.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.284
At sea, all we really needed
were the stars

34:56.286 --> 34:57.888
to get us wherever
we were going.

34:57.890 --> 35:01.796
Life at sea sounds like...
a thrilling adventure.

35:01.798 --> 35:04.200
Well, it's not!
A lot of it is hard work.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.637
And you're always
watching your back.

35:05.639 --> 35:07.675
Not all of us are
as charmed as you.

35:07.677 --> 35:09.978
Whoa, I can't
help it if I'm too charming.

35:09.980 --> 35:11.448
What? Please!

35:11.450 --> 35:15.356
Look, the adoration of these
princesses won't last forever.

35:15.358 --> 35:17.627
- I'll break the curse.
- How?

35:17.629 --> 35:20.466
The missing piece of
the puzzle is out there.

35:20.468 --> 35:23.139
- That's barely even a plan!
- Why are you such a pessimist?

35:23.141 --> 35:24.942
Why are you such an optimist?

35:24.944 --> 35:26.580
We're totally lost!

35:26.582 --> 35:29.955
Yes, but with every new step,
there is hope.

35:31.124 --> 35:33.158
But not that step.

35:37.937 --> 35:39.371
Uh-oh!

35:39.373 --> 35:41.277
What is it?

35:45.853 --> 35:48.088
- It's the Matilija.
- The Matili-wha?

35:48.090 --> 35:50.528
A forest tribe
of savage giants.

35:50.530 --> 35:53.231
No-one has ever survived
an encounter with them.

35:53.233 --> 35:55.035
Hold on - if no-one
has ever survived

35:55.037 --> 35:56.471
an encounter with them,

35:56.473 --> 35:58.209
how does anyone know
they exist?

35:58.211 --> 36:00.379
Because... well...

36:00.381 --> 36:02.851
You know, I've never
actually thought about that.

36:06.761 --> 36:08.398
- Oh!
- Whoa!

36:15.144 --> 36:16.579
OK. We're dead.

36:16.581 --> 36:20.987
Lenny,
my friend, do not fret.

36:20.989 --> 36:22.625
I got this.

36:25.933 --> 36:30.943
Well, hello there,
you delicate little flowers!

36:36.989 --> 36:39.595
Sometimes it's a curse...

36:41.129 --> 36:42.632
..and a blessing.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.871
So, what time's the party?

36:45.873 --> 36:47.339
And what can we bring?

36:48.778 --> 36:50.847
Let's get
this party started!

36:52.753 --> 36:57.226
If you love to eat people,
let me hear you scream!

37:00.168 --> 37:02.573
Alright, this one's
for the ladies!

37:06.481 --> 37:09.719
Let me hear those stomachs roar!

37:09.721 --> 37:11.656
They're very light
on their feet.

37:13.094 --> 37:15.631
Hey, that's... quite a hairpin.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.804
The indestructible dagger
of the Matilija,

37:18.806 --> 37:22.242
forged in the Fire Mountain
centuries ago

37:22.244 --> 37:24.915
for the husband of the chief.

37:28.424 --> 37:31.730
Let the anointing begin!

37:31.732 --> 37:33.264
Anointing?

37:33.266 --> 37:35.571
Ah! Of course.

37:35.573 --> 37:37.707
Under normal circumstances,

37:37.709 --> 37:39.912
you'd be rubbed
from head to toe

37:39.914 --> 37:42.817
with the sacred oil
of our ancestors.

37:42.819 --> 37:47.494
But since we cannot decide who
should be allowed to anoint you,

37:47.496 --> 37:50.033
we'll all take a turn!

37:50.035 --> 37:52.439
That's a lot of anointing.

37:53.308 --> 37:55.544
Uh, what happened to my friend?

37:55.546 --> 37:58.917
The ugly one
with the bad moustache?

37:58.919 --> 38:00.888
He will not be anointed.

38:00.890 --> 38:04.126
However, as a special
wedding gift to you,

38:04.128 --> 38:06.431
he will also not be eaten.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.537
Until breakfast!

38:08.539 --> 38:11.743
Oh, that's very generous.

38:11.745 --> 38:13.179
Where is he?

38:13.181 --> 38:14.849
With the Half-Oracle.

38:14.851 --> 38:16.350
The Half-Oracle?

38:16.352 --> 38:18.623
She is only blind in one eye

38:18.625 --> 38:21.361
and therefore only right
half the time.

38:21.363 --> 38:25.336
You are here
on a mission of love.

38:25.338 --> 38:28.610
Love? Well, yes, technically.

38:28.612 --> 38:30.413
Charming's, not mine.

38:30.415 --> 38:33.351
You seek one who has
departed this realm.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.889
What? No!

38:34.891 --> 38:38.162
You have sentenced your heart to
eternity in your soul's dungeon

38:38.164 --> 38:39.802
and tossed the key.

38:41.505 --> 38:43.806
- You enjoy knitting.
- No, I don't.

38:43.808 --> 38:47.681
Ah. You are on the verge of
a betrayal so monumental

38:47.683 --> 38:50.085
that love itself
hangs in the balance.

38:50.087 --> 38:52.893
Betrayal is such a harsh
word, don't you think?

38:53.662 --> 38:55.831
When you return home,
you will join a convent.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.266
Um... no.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.136
But long-dormant embers
of your own hope

38:59.138 --> 39:00.640
threaten to ignite within you,

39:00.642 --> 39:03.312
for you have allowed yourself
to be touched by another,

39:03.314 --> 39:05.349
and therefore
you must now question

39:05.351 --> 39:08.288
all previous assumptions
of self.

39:08.290 --> 39:09.725
OK, maybe.

39:09.727 --> 39:12.864
Maybe on some level
that I can't access

39:12.866 --> 39:16.638
I'm hoping that I can maybe
learn to love someone.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.609
By sharing true love's kiss.

39:18.611 --> 39:20.045
"I'm just no-one,

39:20.047 --> 39:22.917
"therefore I can never
experience true love's kiss."

39:22.919 --> 39:24.353
I don't sound like that!

39:24.355 --> 39:27.193
But you're right.
True love cannot save you.

39:27.195 --> 39:31.367
Hmm! Unless... you let it in.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.039
Ugh! Isn't true love...
overrated?

39:34.041 --> 39:37.046
Yes, yes... I see it now.

41:38.892 --> 41:41.965
Wait! I have one more question.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.101
Is it possible that...

41:45.103 --> 41:49.845
..well, that... Charming could
maybe possibly be my true love?

41:49.847 --> 41:52.282
- Yes.
- You're certain?

41:52.284 --> 41:55.455
- No.
- Ugh! Half-Oracle!

41:55.457 --> 41:57.895
Whoo! Hot potato!

41:59.866 --> 42:01.569
Ladies, please, please!

42:01.571 --> 42:03.673
That tickles!

42:03.675 --> 42:05.709
I'm like a bar of soap!

42:23.413 --> 42:25.282
Please let me go.
Please let me go.

42:25.284 --> 42:27.887
I never meant to hurt you all.

42:27.889 --> 42:30.327
I can break the curse,
if I could just...

42:34.335 --> 42:37.039
What?! Where am I?
What happened?

42:38.878 --> 42:41.915
Illy! Where's Lenny?

42:41.917 --> 42:44.086
Then a rescue plan is up to us.

42:44.088 --> 42:47.395
The dagger! Good idea!

43:07.468 --> 43:09.905
The road has a code.

43:09.907 --> 43:11.474
Leave no friend...

43:13.146 --> 43:15.284
..behind.

43:26.741 --> 43:29.713
Illy!

43:30.481 --> 43:32.783
- You look awfully shiny.
- Oh, thanks.

43:32.785 --> 43:34.755
150 anointings
will do that to a man.

43:34.757 --> 43:36.758
Come on.
We got to get out of here.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.160
The chief and I
are getting married, and...

43:38.162 --> 43:39.631
Well, we're eating you
for breakfast.

43:39.633 --> 43:43.105
Well, that does explain why
I've been marinating all night.

43:43.107 --> 43:44.674
Mmm...

43:44.676 --> 43:47.113
Tangy.
It's quite nice, actually.

43:47.115 --> 43:48.785
Right?

43:49.554 --> 43:52.192
Teriyaki?

43:54.328 --> 43:56.397
Oh!

43:56.399 --> 43:57.901
- Hey!
- Oh. Uh...

43:57.903 --> 44:00.439
You know,
you have the loveliest... eye.

44:00.441 --> 44:01.975
See ya!

44:01.977 --> 44:04.380
Quick! They're escaping!

44:04.382 --> 44:08.355
And they're either going
to get away or they're not!

44:09.793 --> 44:12.328
Hyah!

44:12.330 --> 44:14.001
Climb up!

44:15.204 --> 44:18.107
No, no! Not my true love!

44:18.109 --> 44:19.544
Stop him!

44:19.546 --> 44:21.447
He has
the indestructible dagger.

44:21.449 --> 44:22.917
And our breakfast.

44:22.919 --> 44:25.789
On the bright side,
surviving an unsurvivable attack

44:25.791 --> 44:27.258
IS on our to-do list.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.998
Hey! The gauntlet!
You do believe.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.740
Huh!

44:38.717 --> 44:40.151
Ugh!

44:40.153 --> 44:42.256
Whoa! Lenny, dude.
Very heavy.

44:42.258 --> 44:44.995
- That's the horse!
- Found a torch!

44:44.997 --> 44:47.066
That's my ankle.

44:47.068 --> 44:49.202
OK. We got to
get some light in here.

44:49.204 --> 44:51.875
Ugh! Not what I meant!

44:51.877 --> 44:54.080
No-one can have him but me!

44:54.082 --> 44:56.149
You are mine! Mine!

44:56.151 --> 44:58.922
- All mine!
- There's no other way out.

44:58.924 --> 45:01.928
You and me forever!

45:01.930 --> 45:05.268
And ever and ever and ever!

45:05.270 --> 45:07.574
- It doesn't end like this.
- Why?

45:07.576 --> 45:10.379
'Cause your father handed down
some insane theory

45:10.381 --> 45:13.318
about what it takes to find love
in this cruel world?

45:13.320 --> 45:16.791
No, because I cannot die here.
Not today.

45:16.793 --> 45:18.728
I wasted my time talking,
not doing.

45:18.730 --> 45:20.600
Yeah, well...

45:20.602 --> 45:25.042
I wanted to see the Pyramids.
But I guess I'm not going to.

45:25.044 --> 45:28.315
I've done nothing for
anyone in this world but myself.

45:28.317 --> 45:30.887
I want to put an end
to my curse.

45:30.889 --> 45:33.491
I want a happily ever after.

45:33.493 --> 45:35.161
For everyone.

45:35.163 --> 45:36.665
Yeah.

45:36.667 --> 45:39.771
I want that too.

45:39.773 --> 45:41.941
There's something
I need to tell you.

45:41.943 --> 45:44.246
The thing is... Well...

45:44.248 --> 45:48.020
I'm not really...

45:48.022 --> 45:51.062
There!

46:00.046 --> 46:02.852
- Thank you.
- For what?

46:03.822 --> 46:06.925
- Coming back for me.
- Well, we're almost there.

46:06.927 --> 46:09.463
I still haven't chosen a bride.

46:09.465 --> 46:11.434
Right. The princesses.

46:11.436 --> 46:13.939
What about
Snowy What's-Her-Name?

46:13.941 --> 46:16.176
Oh, Snow White.
Had a bad childhood.

46:16.178 --> 46:18.949
Yeah, an evil queen tricked her
into eating a poisoned apple.

46:18.951 --> 46:21.822
But, you know, she never stopped
trusting people.

46:21.824 --> 46:24.427
Can you turn around?

46:24.429 --> 46:26.865
Yeah, I don't want to
turn my back to the window.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.802
And I really shouldn't
talk to strangers.

46:28.804 --> 46:32.176
- I'm the painter.
- Or you could be a witch.

46:32.178 --> 46:34.379
No! No, I'm... I'm the painter.

46:34.381 --> 46:37.051
Did you hear that? Shh!

46:37.053 --> 46:40.057
- Little feet.
- Um... Let's try some props.

46:40.059 --> 46:42.228
- Will you accept this apple?
- Ah! No apples!

46:42.230 --> 46:43.933
No, wait!

46:43.935 --> 46:46.771
- Oh, yeah, she's a keeper.
- Yeah.

46:46.773 --> 46:49.342
Well, let's keep moving.

46:49.344 --> 46:51.149
Buddy.

46:51.917 --> 46:55.523
So, you bested the man-eaters,

46:55.525 --> 46:59.967
an impressive and unexpected
turn of events.

47:01.737 --> 47:04.640
But I wager
you'll not fare so well

47:04.642 --> 47:09.519
when faced with
your own worst temptations.

47:15.798 --> 47:17.299
Mine!

47:17.301 --> 47:21.274
Oh! And I'll take this one.
And I'll take this one too.

47:21.276 --> 47:23.443
- Ooh! And I'll take this one!
- Hmm.

47:23.445 --> 47:27.221
Ooh! And I'll take this one.
Ooh, and I'll take this one too.

47:28.189 --> 47:29.425
Wow!

47:39.646 --> 47:41.681
Ooh!

47:41.683 --> 47:43.350
That is definitely mine.

47:43.352 --> 47:45.421
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

47:45.423 --> 47:49.564
We cannot allow false
temptations to distract us now.

47:49.566 --> 47:52.936
It's just a colourful rock,
Lenny. Let's go!

47:52.938 --> 47:54.875
Whoa!

47:54.877 --> 47:57.312
I take it back!
That's not a rock!

47:57.314 --> 48:00.188
- Not a rock! Not a rock!
- Mine!

48:15.719 --> 48:18.157
Look out!

48:19.893 --> 48:24.534
Now, that's what I call
an unconquerable beast.

48:27.007 --> 48:30.245
Let's do this. Attack!

48:30.247 --> 48:33.320
Ow!

48:40.266 --> 48:43.137
- Are you OK?
- Ugh!

48:43.139 --> 48:46.478
Are you kidding?
This is exactly what I needed.

48:46.480 --> 48:50.151
Listen. No matter what happens,
you cannot help me.

48:50.153 --> 48:53.257
Wait! You're not gonna
try and fight that thing alone?!

48:53.259 --> 48:55.762
To complete the gauntlet,
I must.

48:55.764 --> 48:57.198
No! No! I'm sorry.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.635
I can't just stand here

48:58.637 --> 49:00.471
and watch you
get pummelled to death.

49:00.473 --> 49:01.975
Lenny. Your oath.

49:01.977 --> 49:04.914
You have my word.

49:11.161 --> 49:14.199
Striking deliberately!
With respect!

49:14.201 --> 49:16.440
I did not use
the word 'scoundrel'!

49:17.942 --> 49:20.945
Well, that played out
differently in my mind.

49:20.947 --> 49:23.316
Hola.

49:29.666 --> 49:33.742
So... Not a female
unconquerable beast, then?

49:36.747 --> 49:38.816
Hey, you!

49:38.818 --> 49:41.454
Come here! Fight me!

49:41.456 --> 49:44.827
Oh, come on! I'm trying
to run the gauntlet here.

49:51.241 --> 49:53.679
Ha-ha! I got you now!

49:53.681 --> 49:55.180
You're mine, beast!

49:55.182 --> 49:57.487
Embarrassing.

49:57.489 --> 49:59.757
Huh!

49:59.759 --> 50:02.533
Huh...

50:03.767 --> 50:06.439
Whoa!

50:20.066 --> 50:22.670
The gem, he wants it back!

50:25.678 --> 50:27.011
Incoming!

50:35.095 --> 50:38.704
I think you were looking
for this.

50:55.837 --> 50:57.338
I did it!

50:57.340 --> 51:00.245
I did it!

51:00.247 --> 51:02.782
I didn't do it!

51:09.599 --> 51:11.232
Look at him.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.271
Yeah.

51:13.273 --> 51:15.976
He's totally gonna die.
And for love!

51:15.978 --> 51:17.513
Lenny!

51:17.515 --> 51:19.449
Lenny!

51:19.451 --> 51:21.888
I mean... He really believes it.

51:21.890 --> 51:24.661
Could the answer I gave up
finding so long ago

51:24.663 --> 51:27.932
truly be as simple
as a blind leap?

51:27.934 --> 51:29.368
Lenny!

51:29.370 --> 51:31.307
And a little faith
that I'll be caught?

51:31.309 --> 51:34.246
I know I said
"no matter what", but...

51:34.248 --> 51:36.183
Help!

51:36.185 --> 51:37.652
Maybe there's more to him

51:37.654 --> 51:40.626
than just a prince
looking for a princess.

51:40.628 --> 51:44.801
For the love
of anything you love, help me!

51:48.175 --> 51:49.913
Charming!

52:24.081 --> 52:27.084
Yes! Ha-ha!

52:27.086 --> 52:29.055
Oh. Well...

52:29.057 --> 52:30.691
You complete me too.

52:30.693 --> 52:32.362
Ow!

52:32.364 --> 52:35.868
OK. Oh. Bumping. Yeah.

52:35.870 --> 52:37.237
He did it!

52:37.239 --> 52:39.342
He conquered
the unconquerable beast

52:39.344 --> 52:41.012
with a missing piece.

52:41.014 --> 52:43.718
I-is he MY missing piece?

52:43.720 --> 52:46.056
No. That's stupid.

52:46.058 --> 52:49.028
But... What if?

52:49.030 --> 52:50.731
I need to know for sure.

52:50.733 --> 52:52.535
If I deliver him
to those princesses

52:52.537 --> 52:54.105
at Fire Mountain tomorrow,

52:54.107 --> 52:57.314
I'll never know if he could fall
for a girl like me.

52:58.484 --> 53:01.956
She's a bigger threat
than I imagined.

53:03.494 --> 53:07.332
But a heart locked away
for so long can be fragile.

53:07.334 --> 53:10.304
It doesn't take much
to break it.

53:10.306 --> 53:12.742
Got you a souvenir!

53:12.744 --> 53:15.883
He just squeezes these out.

53:15.885 --> 53:17.952
Did YOU see?

53:17.954 --> 53:19.890
Hey.

53:19.892 --> 53:21.561
Where's Lenny?

53:23.198 --> 53:24.734
What's this?

53:24.736 --> 53:27.943
"Meet me at The Dainty Dish
at eight."

Pardon me. The Dainty Dish?

55:55.435 --> 55:56.937
Welcome to
The Dainty Dish,

55:56.939 --> 56:00.210
home of the world-famous
long claws.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.554
Wha...?!

56:05.556 --> 56:07.023
If you wish to enter,

56:07.025 --> 56:09.729
you must answer
my questions three.

56:09.731 --> 56:12.768
- OK.
- How many people in your party?

56:12.770 --> 56:14.338
Uh... Two.

56:14.340 --> 56:16.676
Do you have a reservation?

56:16.678 --> 56:19.182
- I think so.
- And how will you be paying?

56:19.184 --> 56:21.887
Hmm. Don't princes eat free?

56:21.889 --> 56:23.289
Ow!

56:23.291 --> 56:25.429
I'll pay cash.

56:29.471 --> 56:32.942
You are...
Welcome to The Dainty Dish!

56:32.944 --> 56:35.682
You're the first in your party
to arrive.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.652
May I show you to your table?

56:37.654 --> 56:41.094
Uh... Please.

56:46.238 --> 56:48.675
Curse this curse! Just blend in.

56:48.677 --> 56:51.112
Hey, watch it!

56:51.114 --> 56:52.582
Be cool.

56:52.584 --> 56:54.351
Avoid eye contact.

56:54.353 --> 56:57.290
Choose one of the princesses,
quick!

56:57.292 --> 56:59.762
Wonderful, wonderful.
Enchanté.

56:59.764 --> 57:02.668
Ah! Here we go, monsieur, and...

57:02.670 --> 57:05.307
Our special tonight is paella.

57:05.309 --> 57:09.014
Hmm. Paella.

57:09.016 --> 57:11.854
<i>Hm.
My knees felt like paella once.</i>

57:11.856 --> 57:15.026
<i>Ah! I wonder whatever happened
to that bandit woman.</i>

57:15.028 --> 57:17.701
<i>Hmm. Best just to
order the kebabs.</i>

57:19.973 --> 57:21.574
Ladies...

57:21.576 --> 57:24.444
Prince Charming
could use some company.

57:24.446 --> 57:26.116
Well...

57:26.118 --> 57:27.885
Here goes.

57:30.893 --> 57:33.330
And that is my tale.
Now that I've conquered...

57:33.332 --> 57:35.033
..the unconquerable...

57:35.035 --> 57:39.207
..this prince must choose
his princess.

57:39.209 --> 57:43.553
Now, which one of the three?
I get married tomorrow.

57:44.989 --> 57:47.090
I'm such an idiot.

57:47.092 --> 57:51.299
What was I thinking?
He'll always want a princess.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.005
Not some commoner.

57:54.007 --> 57:55.742
No!

57:55.744 --> 57:58.012
This is how it goes
from here, Illy.

57:58.014 --> 58:01.385
We deliver him to the mountain.
We collect our payment.

58:01.387 --> 58:03.691
We move on to the next job.

58:03.693 --> 58:05.727
Trust nothing.

58:05.729 --> 58:07.802
Especially your heart.

58:09.671 --> 58:12.745
Hurts, doesn't it?

58:15.015 --> 58:19.959
♪ I never wanted

Ooh! The Fire Mountain.
We're here.

58:42.169 --> 58:46.376
Hey. What happened to you last
night? You, uh, never showed up.

58:46.378 --> 58:49.550
- I changed my mind.
- Are you OK?

58:49.552 --> 58:52.021
- I'm fine.
- Oh, good.

58:52.023 --> 58:55.929
I wish you had come. That
restaurant you picked was...

58:55.931 --> 58:58.132
Well...
It was challenging for me.

58:58.134 --> 59:00.437
I was telling stories
of our journey.

59:00.439 --> 59:02.976
And then I remembered the words
of this girl I met,

59:02.978 --> 59:04.612
before I even
started the gauntlet.

59:04.614 --> 59:06.850
- Really? And what could that be?
- To let go.

59:06.852 --> 59:11.626
Let go of my old ways,
of my doubts, of my immaturity.

59:11.628 --> 59:15.267
Today, I must put that aside
and trust my feelings.

59:15.269 --> 59:17.942
Like a compass pointing north.

59:18.710 --> 59:21.246
Careful you don't let go
of something valuable.

59:21.248 --> 59:23.250
Oh, is this 'cause
I finished all the pancakes?

59:23.252 --> 59:24.452
- No!
- And the coffee?

59:24.454 --> 59:25.687
- No.
- And the trail mix?

59:25.689 --> 59:27.391
- No!
- Oh!

59:27.393 --> 59:28.828
Thank goodness.

59:28.830 --> 59:31.833
Because in just three days,
you have become

59:31.835 --> 59:35.842
the only true friend
I have ever had.

59:35.844 --> 59:39.180
Friend? True love?

59:39.182 --> 59:40.851
Choosing who to marry?

59:40.853 --> 59:42.521
You know, you throw
these terms around

59:42.523 --> 59:44.392
like you have any idea
what they mean.

59:44.394 --> 59:47.564
Well, I hate to break it to you,
FRIEND. You don't.

59:47.566 --> 59:52.642
And you? You, who refuse to
trust anyone? You understand?

59:52.644 --> 59:54.979
No, I don't,
but I never claimed to.

59:54.981 --> 59:58.085
If you have to pick
a princess today, so be it,

59:58.087 --> 01:00:00.390
but I have news for you,
Prince Charming.

01:00:00.392 --> 01:00:03.997
If you really love someone, you
would only have eyes for her.

01:00:03.999 --> 01:00:05.635
If you really love someone,

01:00:05.637 --> 01:00:07.505
you would dissolve
all other engagements

01:00:07.507 --> 01:00:09.174
before ever seeking her hand.

01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:12.181
And if you really love someone,
you would know how cruel it is

01:00:12.183 --> 01:00:16.523
to allow her, or anyone else, to
believe that SHE might love YOU.

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.530
I have to make a choice, Lenny.
My time's run out.

01:00:20.532 --> 01:00:22.668
Don't let yours run out.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.042
Don't wait too long
to see the Pyramids.

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:42.475
Well, well! It's about time.

01:00:42.477 --> 01:00:45.112
At least
he made it in one piece.

01:00:45.114 --> 01:00:47.017
Uh, Lenny,
what is he talking about?

01:00:47.019 --> 01:00:51.826
Your fortunes. I trust these
satisfy the terms of our deal.

01:00:51.828 --> 01:00:54.397
Wait. What deal was that?

01:00:54.399 --> 01:00:58.173
To get you here, all the way,
unharmed, through the gauntlet.

01:00:58.175 --> 01:01:00.944
No-one thought you'd make it.
Not even me.

01:01:00.946 --> 01:01:03.248
I thought you were my friend.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.787
Tell me one true thing
about you.

01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:07.862
Fine.

01:01:12.804 --> 01:01:15.373
It was her all along!

01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:17.344
This is weird.

01:01:17.346 --> 01:01:18.848
Love is blind!

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:23.422
Get a hold of yourself. Guards!

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.259
That was my face.

01:01:25.261 --> 01:01:27.898
This feeling, it's so weird.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.368
Don't you get it?

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.007
We passed through
an unpassable pass together.

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:33.142
Ow!

01:01:33.144 --> 01:01:35.615
We survived the
unsurvivable attack together!

01:01:35.617 --> 01:01:37.050
It doesn't bend that way.

01:01:37.052 --> 01:01:39.420
And then,
I single-handedly saved her

01:01:39.422 --> 01:01:41.192
from an unconquerable beast!

01:01:41.194 --> 01:01:44.665
And then, you took the leap
of blind faith for each other.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.235
No.

01:01:46.237 --> 01:01:47.938
That's not true.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.176
I leapt for you, Philippe.

01:01:50.178 --> 01:01:53.048
I actually let myself
believe in you

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.754
and all your
true love nonsense.

01:01:55.756 --> 01:01:58.726
That's why I invited you
to The Dainty Dish,

01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:00.396
to tell you.

01:02:00.398 --> 01:02:03.136
To tell me what?

01:02:04.575 --> 01:02:06.845
That... I...

01:02:12.757 --> 01:02:14.258
You know what?

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.730
Why don't you just ask
one of your fiancées?

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:17.999
No!

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.837
My only true love
is this treasure.

01:02:20.839 --> 01:02:22.774
Lenore!

01:02:22.776 --> 01:02:25.080
I can't lose you.

01:02:25.082 --> 01:02:28.118
Now for the matter at hand.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.287
Ladies...

01:02:29.289 --> 01:02:31.859
Ladies! Eyes front.

01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.730
Hello?!

01:02:33.732 --> 01:02:35.834
Prince Charming.

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.372
It is time to choose
your one true love

01:02:38.374 --> 01:02:41.880
and liberate all others
from your spell.

01:02:41.882 --> 01:02:44.885
Do you choose Sleeping Beauty...

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:46.590
..Snow White...

01:02:46.592 --> 01:02:48.194
..or Cinderella?

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.039
I choose...

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:56.677
..none of you.

01:02:56.679 --> 01:02:58.211
- What?!
- Excuse me?!

01:02:58.213 --> 01:03:01.552
I'm sorry. I never knew
what love really felt like.

01:03:01.554 --> 01:03:03.122
But now I do.

01:03:03.124 --> 01:03:07.899
As wonderful as you all may be,
I have found my true love.

01:03:07.901 --> 01:03:10.406
But she has chosen treasure
over me.

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:15.747
To feel this way
and then have it taken from you,

01:03:15.749 --> 01:03:18.151
that truly IS a curse.

01:03:18.153 --> 01:03:21.024
I cannot do this to my people,

01:03:21.026 --> 01:03:23.229
wipe out all love itself.

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:25.735
So if I can't break the curse,

01:03:25.737 --> 01:03:29.612
then the curse
must die... with me.

01:03:35.288 --> 01:03:37.424
<i>"My sweet, sweet Valerie.</i>

01:03:37.426 --> 01:03:40.765
<i>"I write you now in my
final hour to liberate you</i>

01:03:40.767 --> 01:03:43.904
<i>"so that you may seek
the love that you deserve.</i>

01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:46.408
<i>"I've found my true love.</i>

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:50.851
<i>"Now be free and go forth
and find yours.</i>

01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:52.623
<i>"Philippe."</i>

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.118
<i>"Darling Vanessa,</i>

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.760
<i>"I write you now in these,
my final hours."</i>

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.572
It's unacceptable.

01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:21.444
- You are a crown prince.
- I have to do this, Papa.

01:04:21.446 --> 01:04:24.688
What difference does it make
if they make me wait?

01:04:25.723 --> 01:04:28.359
This just isn't right.

01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:31.232
And on your birthday,
of all days!

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:35.172
But that's exactly why I have to
do this today.

01:04:35.174 --> 01:04:37.644
I must die before the sun sets.

01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:41.556
It is the only way to liberate
our people from my curse.

And what are these?

01:04:44.594 --> 01:04:46.127
I need them all to know...

01:04:46.129 --> 01:04:48.366
..that they never really
loved me.

01:04:48.368 --> 01:04:52.073
I felt it, Papa! I felt love.

01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:55.312
And just like that,
I lost it forever.

01:04:55.314 --> 01:05:01.258
She must know that thanks to
her, I felt it, before I died.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.864
I will see
that they are delivered.

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:08.339
What a fine man
you have become.

01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:11.414

Oh, thank you -
you are surprisingly pleasant

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:32.828
for a man
who kills people for a living.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:35.801
Oh, it's just a job. My heart's
not in it really, you know.

01:07:35.803 --> 01:07:38.341
I just happen to have
a talent for the work.

01:07:41.413 --> 01:07:43.449
Good people.

01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:48.092
Standing here before you

01:07:48.094 --> 01:07:52.433
my heart broken,
my soul tortured,

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:55.372
I need you all to know
that I finally understand

01:07:55.374 --> 01:08:00.181
the pain and suffering
I have caused so many.

01:08:00.183 --> 01:08:01.785
I will sacrifice myself

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:04.089

He's doing this for us.

01:08:08.635 --> 01:08:11.370
Lovely speech. Always
a tough crowd at these things.

01:08:11.372 --> 01:08:13.610
- Death and all, you know.
- Oh, uh...

01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:16.013
- We're up to this part already?
- Afraid so, yes.

01:08:16.015 --> 01:08:21.023
So, if we could just pop our
little head into the noose here.

01:08:21.024 --> 01:08:22.661
There's a good lad. Yes.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:24.363
We've got a football match

01:08:30.044 --> 01:08:32.179
Uh, no, uh... Not really.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.850
Sorry. Sorry. I don't know
why I always ask that.

01:08:34.853 --> 01:08:37.991
Uh... Right. And a-one.

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:41.765
A-two. Two and a quarter.

01:08:41.767 --> 01:08:43.938
Two and a half.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:47.978
Uh... What are you doing?

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:49.514
Oh, well, you see,
traditionally,

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.050
if someone wanted
to save you

01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.629
in an impressive act of heroism,
this would be the moment.

01:08:57.264 --> 01:08:59.602
Oh. Well... Guess not.

01:08:59.604 --> 01:09:01.203

- Ha!
- Huh! Huh!

01:09:10.826 --> 01:09:12.225
Hey! A change of heart?

01:09:12.228 --> 01:09:14.229
A blind leap of faith.

01:09:14.231 --> 01:09:15.832
You were right about me.

01:09:15.835 --> 01:09:18.340
And I was wrong about you.

01:09:19.209 --> 01:09:22.013
Let's just say
a little bird told me.

01:09:22.015 --> 01:09:24.185
You're my one true love.

01:09:26.256 --> 01:09:29.661
Is that true love's kiss
on your lips?

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:32.300
Oh, no, you don't!

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:36.542

01:09:40.383 --> 01:09:42.352
What is this? What's going on?

01:09:42.354 --> 01:09:45.459
It's Nemeny Neverwish.
She wants to keep us apart.

01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:48.368
Well, too bad for her.

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.171
Sorry, friend.

01:09:51.173 --> 01:09:53.274
Shall we dance? Ha-ha!

01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:54.912
Where is she?

01:09:54.914 --> 01:09:57.249
I'm right here, darling.

01:10:00.692 --> 01:10:01.826

01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:03.762

royal pain you turned out to be.

01:10:17.057 --> 01:10:18.761
Tell me.

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:24.370
What part of "doomed to never
love" do you not understand?!

01:10:24.372 --> 01:10:27.910
That is YOUR curse, not mine.

01:10:30.485 --> 01:10:32.687
Sorry, dearie.

01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:35.192
You can't break something
that's already broken!

01:10:35.194 --> 01:10:36.995
No. I'M sorry.

01:10:36.997 --> 01:10:40.034
Because I'm done
letting anyone else tell me

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:42.440
who I can and cannot choose.

01:10:42.442 --> 01:10:44.912
We'll see about that!

01:10:44.914 --> 01:10:47.553
No!

01:10:54.899 --> 01:10:58.337

01:12:12.889 --> 01:12:15.459
You broke the curse
for everyone.

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:18.632
But you also saved a girl
born at sea.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:21.707
You WERE magical.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.449
What?

01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:29.854
What is happening to me?

01:12:31.293 --> 01:12:32.928
