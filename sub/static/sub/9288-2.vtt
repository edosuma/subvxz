01:14.225 --> 01:15.643
Walsh isn't answering.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.563
As soon as you reach him,
you find me.

01:20.932 --> 01:22.317
Is this the crew list from the 747?

01:22.818 --> 01:23.819
Yeah.

01:24.187 --> 01:25.488
Should I get a maintenance
history on the plane?

01:25.688 --> 01:28.691
No. For now, let's just assume
this was not an accident.

01:28.891 --> 01:30.744
- Why?
- It originated out of Berlin.

01:30.944 --> 01:32.997
It's where Walsh said the
shooter was coming from.

01:33.497 --> 01:37.502
Break down the crew and passenger list..
..political affiliation, criminal record..

01:38.003 --> 01:40.205
...country of origin and residence.

01:40.405 --> 01:41.456
- Jack.
- What?

01:43.626 --> 01:45.294
You want to tell me what's
going on here tonight?

01:45.795 --> 01:46.595
What's going on?

01:47.096 --> 01:48.681
Besides a 747 falling out of the sky...

01:48.881 --> 01:51.218
...and a threat on a presidential
candidate's life?

01:51.418 --> 01:53.270
That's right. Besides that.

01:53.470 --> 01:55.739
Look, George Mason comes in here...

01:55.939 --> 01:59.444
...disappears up in your office for a
half an hour, then he limps out.

02:00.445 --> 02:01.529
What's that all about?

02:03.782 --> 02:05.067
Tell him, Jack.

02:08.454 --> 02:10.205
- Fine, then I will.
- Nina...

02:10.539 --> 02:13.626
The three agents that Jack brought
down on bribery charges...

02:13.826 --> 02:15.428
...were close friends of Mason.

02:15.628 --> 02:17.048
He's been looking for
payback ever since.

02:17.248 --> 02:20.668
He chose tonight to make some
pretty nasty accusations about Jack...

02:20.868 --> 02:22.888
...as well as some other
people in this office.

02:26.141 --> 02:30.730
In case you haven't noticed, Jack doesn't
have a lot of tolerance for criticism.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.565
I need that right away.

02:35.068 --> 02:37.855
I'll get you that list within the hour.

02:38.055 --> 02:39.323
Thank you.

02:48.616 --> 02:50.686
That was quite a story.

02:50.886 --> 02:52.955
It's better than the truth.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.610
Did you get the ID?

03:55.611 --> 03:56.612
Yes.

04:51.758 --> 04:56.264
It's funny. When you came to Jack's rescue
back there with your little performance..

04:56.464 --> 04:58.766
...it reminded me of something.

04:59.768 --> 05:01.770
Yeah, what?

05:02.271 --> 05:05.107
Remember that time we came into
work together about a month ago?

05:05.307 --> 05:07.911
Lisa made some wisecrack remark...

05:08.111 --> 05:10.614
...and you came up with this
really great B.S. story...

05:11.114 --> 05:14.118
...an early breakfast meeting
with District Three.

05:16.621 --> 05:20.425
I was really impressed with how
convincing a liar you are.

05:22.928 --> 05:25.315
What's your point, Tony?

05:25.515 --> 05:28.518
I want to know what happened up
there between Jack and Mason.

05:28.718 --> 05:30.320
I already told you.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.398
And I don't believe you.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.275
Maybe I should ask Mason.

05:34.475 --> 05:37.478
A presidential candidate's
life is at stake.

05:37.678 --> 05:39.781
Maybe you should get back to work.

05:48.457 --> 05:50.961
I think we need to turn right here.

06:01.255 --> 06:02.757
There it is.

06:18.275 --> 06:19.276
Janet?

06:21.779 --> 06:22.780
Janet?

06:26.268 --> 06:28.086
- Hello?
- Hey, sweetheart.

06:28.286 --> 06:31.791
- Have you found the girls yet?
- No. We just got here.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.293
Janet's car is parked out front.
I just got here.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.295
All right. I'll wait 'til you check it out.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.798
No, let me call you back.

06:37.998 --> 06:38.599
I'll hold.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.803
- Kim?
- Teri?

06:44.939 --> 06:45.940
Kim?

06:47.442 --> 06:48.943
They were here.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.888
What did you give her?

07:13.389 --> 07:15.424
Nothing she didn't want.

07:17.427 --> 07:20.271
Look, my dad is a government agent.

07:20.471 --> 07:23.117
I thought you said your dad was dead.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.821
He's not. If I'm not home
in the next half hour...

07:27.021 --> 07:28.122
...he's going to be all over this.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.325
Told you, you should have
given her a roofie.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.160
I'm serious. You two are toast.

07:32.611 --> 07:34.496
She's giving me a headache, dude.

07:34.696 --> 07:36.582
- Just chill, okay?
- You chill.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.139
Walsh.

08:04.981 --> 08:06.983
- Did anyone see you come in?
- No.

08:07.484 --> 08:10.329
- You weren't followed?
- Take it easy.

08:10.529 --> 08:13.374
No, I'm not going to
take it easy. I'm not.

08:13.574 --> 08:15.177
I should never have called you.

08:15.377 --> 08:17.880
If you have evidence that someone
inside the agency...

08:18.380 --> 08:20.382
...is involved in a plot
against David Palmer...

08:20.582 --> 08:22.385
...then you had no choice.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.277
Here.

08:29.477 --> 08:31.846
It's all yours. I'm out of this.

08:32.046 --> 08:33.030
Wait.

08:33.230 --> 08:34.482
A keycard?

08:34.683 --> 08:37.034
Yeah, it's just a simple keycard.

08:37.235 --> 08:39.236
The kind we use to get in
and out of the building.

08:39.738 --> 08:40.823
I don't get it.

08:41.023 --> 08:44.193
Normally, the magnetic stripe
has just an access code on it.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.379
But the stripe can hold a ton of data.

08:46.579 --> 08:50.000
On this one, I found a file filled
with references to Palmer.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.802
What's the point?

08:52.002 --> 08:54.005
To smuggle confidential information.

08:54.205 --> 08:58.510
These get in and out of restricted
areas without any scrutiny.

09:01.714 --> 09:04.049
I need you to be reachable
throughout the day.

09:04.249 --> 09:06.018
You said after tonight I'm done.

09:06.219 --> 09:07.688
I can't help it, Scott.

09:07.888 --> 09:11.391
Until we defuse this situation, I
need to be able to find you.

09:11.892 --> 09:14.696
I find out there's an agency conspiracy
to kill David Palmer.

09:14.896 --> 09:20.035
The moment I realized what I stumbled onto,
I put my wife and kid on a plane.

09:20.235 --> 09:22.838
I couldn't even tell them why.

09:23.038 --> 09:25.541
I've been here long enough to know
what I'm dealing with.

09:25.742 --> 09:27.043
It's your thing now. I'm out.

09:27.243 --> 09:28.378
Scott.

09:28.578 --> 09:31.881
What you did took a lot of courage.

09:32.081 --> 09:35.636
I'm asking you to hang in there
with me a little longer.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.838
I did my part. Get someone else.

09:49.018 --> 09:50.436
There is no one else.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.664
You got me for another 24 hours.

09:59.864 --> 10:01.916
Then I'm joining my family.

10:11.845 --> 10:15.348
Yes, I know Palmer gets a lot of death
threats, but this one's got some weight.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.150
We're overloaded.
We'll deal with it...

10:17.350 --> 10:19.353
No, you're gonna have to make some
adjustments in your schedule.

10:19.854 --> 10:22.857
You're gonna have to notify his advance
team, tighten up security on your end.

10:23.057 --> 10:23.858
I understand...

10:24.860 --> 10:26.361
Yes. I've gotta go.
I'll update you in an hour.

10:26.862 --> 10:28.163
You'll update...

10:28.363 --> 10:30.232
- One hour?
- Yes. Fine.

10:33.453 --> 10:33.753
Teri?

10:33.953 --> 10:36.330
Jack. I need you.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.709
- Richard?
- Yeah.

10:38.909 --> 10:42.463
I'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza. I got
two shooters trying to hit me...

10:42.663 --> 10:43.714
...and an agent down.

10:43.915 --> 10:44.966
Richard, what's going on?

10:45.467 --> 10:48.503
I've got hard information on
who is behind the Palmer hit.

10:48.703 --> 10:50.305
Isley can get there before me.

10:50.506 --> 10:52.758
- He's in the area.
- No, don't call anyone.

10:52.958 --> 10:55.261
We still don't know who we can trust.

10:55.461 --> 10:57.648
Just get me out of here.

10:57.848 --> 11:00.183
- I'll be there in 10 minutes.
- I'll be on the roof.

11:02.602 --> 11:03.320
Richard?

11:04.155 --> 11:05.156
Richard?

11:22.792 --> 11:23.594
Hello?

11:23.794 --> 11:25.680
Hey, It's Me. What's going on?
Is Kim at the store?

11:25.880 --> 11:27.732
No, she's not here.

11:27.932 --> 11:29.434
I thought you said you saw their car.

11:29.935 --> 11:32.003
We think she left with the boys.

11:32.203 --> 11:34.072
This guy you're with, York...

11:34.272 --> 11:36.675
...does he know either of these boys?

11:36.875 --> 11:39.078
No, but one of them, Dan, works here.

11:39.278 --> 11:42.198
I'm starting to worry a little bit.
Can't you get over here?

11:42.398 --> 11:46.653
I can't. I don't have time to explain,
but some bad things are happening tonight.

11:46.853 --> 11:49.341
Our daughter's missing I think
that's bad, don't you?

11:49.541 --> 11:53.995
Teri, she's not missing. She's partying.
Kim's smart enough to know her limits.

11:54.195 --> 11:57.883
Yeah? Maybe you should come over here
and see what those limits are, Jack.

11:59.585 --> 12:00.586
What's that supposed to mean?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.139
Nothing.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.726
We're going to wait here for
them to come back for the car.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.730
Call me when you're done
with your emergency, okay?

12:08.930 --> 12:10.532
I will. I'm sorry, okay?

12:10.732 --> 12:13.234
I'll call you as soon as I can.

12:13.434 --> 12:14.152
Bye.

12:22.662 --> 12:26.166
Look, I know it seems like
we're these really bad guys...

12:26.366 --> 12:28.219
...but we're cool, I swear.

12:28.419 --> 12:30.004
There's just some stuff we got to do.

12:30.204 --> 12:32.506
Go along with it,
and you guys won't get hurt.

12:32.706 --> 12:34.876
I don't even know what you
want me to go along with.

12:35.377 --> 12:37.596
Is this some sort of fraternity
stunt or something?

12:38.597 --> 12:40.432
Something like that.

12:40.632 --> 12:44.137
Fine. Whatever. I'll tell your friends
whatever you want me to...

12:44.337 --> 12:45.663
...just let us go.

12:45.863 --> 12:47.190
It's not that simple.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.560
- These people...
- What people?

12:56.284 --> 12:58.486
Dan, pull over. She's choking.

12:58.686 --> 13:00.171
It's okay.

13:00.371 --> 13:03.209
- She's not breathing, you idiot!
- I don't care.

13:10.217 --> 13:12.002
- Stop.
- Get back!

13:18.726 --> 13:20.729
Don't be a moron!

13:26.485 --> 13:28.021
Don't be a bitch.

13:43.371 --> 13:46.676
Brush fires set off by
the wreckage are making the prospect...

13:46.876 --> 13:51.881
...of locating possible survivors of
Flight 221 virtually impossible.

14:00.391 --> 14:02.627
- Has Carl called yet?
- No, not yet.

14:02.827 --> 14:05.063
- Let me know as soon as he does.
- Okay.

14:16.543 --> 14:20.047
It's twenty after one. Weren't
the kids supposed to be back by now?

14:20.548 --> 14:23.050
They stopped to get pizza after the rally.

14:23.918 --> 14:25.921
- You seen this?
- Yeah.

14:29.925 --> 14:31.426
It's horrible.

14:38.352 --> 14:39.570
I'm sorry I walked away before.

14:39.770 --> 14:42.773
What did Maureen Kingsley
say to you on the phone?

14:43.741 --> 14:45.243
It's nothing serious.

14:45.744 --> 14:48.246
I'm overreacting to everything right now.

14:50.699 --> 14:55.755
Today is going to be the second
most important day of my life.

14:55.955 --> 14:58.125
And what would the first one be?

14:59.626 --> 15:01.094
I think you know.

15:02.095 --> 15:04.632
I still like to hear you say it.

15:06.134 --> 15:07.135
All right.

15:10.138 --> 15:12.608
The most important day of my life...

15:16.312 --> 15:19.649
...was when I hit the game-winning
three against DePaul at the Final Four.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.619
You just lost my vote, Senator.

15:22.819 --> 15:25.823
Good night.
Don't let this get to you.

15:32.631 --> 15:33.799
Thanks, honey.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.167
Good night.

15:56.525 --> 16:00.029
We already know about that. We've
got another way around security.

16:00.229 --> 16:02.531
No, I don't want an explanation.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.535
- I just want him in place.
- Hold on.

16:07.537 --> 16:10.041
Gaines. Yeah, I'm finishing
up with him right now.

16:10.241 --> 16:12.043
All right, get back to me.

16:12.543 --> 16:14.846
Hey, Mandy.

16:15.046 --> 16:16.198
Good. Everything put together?

16:16.398 --> 16:17.549
It is. Just get back to me.

16:17.749 --> 16:19.301
I'll get back to you.

16:21.804 --> 16:25.192
- You want something to drink?
- No thanks.

16:25.392 --> 16:27.394
They'll be ready to go by
the time you get there.

16:27.894 --> 16:28.896
Leave now.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.241
It's all there.

16:45.581 --> 16:49.303
- What are you doing this summer?
- Not interested.

16:49.503 --> 16:50.604
You haven't heard my offer.

16:50.804 --> 16:54.591
I don't care. I'm going to
disappear for awhile. Lay low.

16:56.094 --> 16:58.096
So when do I get the ID?

17:03.235 --> 17:04.236
Soon.

17:16.751 --> 17:18.051
Myers.

17:18.252 --> 17:21.039
Nina, it's Jack. Is this a secure line?

17:21.239 --> 17:22.790
No, you want me to transfer it?

17:22.991 --> 17:24.917
No time. I need an entry code.

17:25.117 --> 17:26.845
Entry code? Where are you?

17:27.045 --> 17:29.849
- I needed to take care of something.
- Why didn't you check out with me?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.652
Nina, just get me the code, okay?

17:32.852 --> 17:36.223
2350 Dunlop Plaza, the north parking garage.

17:42.230 --> 17:43.231
Dunlop?

17:44.366 --> 17:45.117
Got it.

17:45.317 --> 17:47.320
9-1-3-6-7-star.

17:50.239 --> 17:51.415
I'm in.

17:51.615 --> 17:52.792
Jack...

19:23.280 --> 19:24.281
Jack.

19:25.783 --> 19:27.935
- Richard, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.288
You said there were two shooters.

19:30.488 --> 19:31.590
At least. Maybe three.

19:31.790 --> 19:32.791
They look like they were ours?

19:32.991 --> 19:34.593
I couldn't tell.

19:34.793 --> 19:36.295
How high does this conspiracy go?

19:36.495 --> 19:37.797
I don't know yet, Jack.

19:38.298 --> 19:40.700
- Did you see anyone downstairs?
- No one.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.303
- Is this the only way out?
- This is it.

19:43.503 --> 19:44.305
Okay.

20:05.295 --> 20:06.964
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no no.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.465
Come here.

20:13.638 --> 20:14.639
Wow.

20:17.142 --> 20:19.345
You look just like Martin Belkin.

20:21.897 --> 20:23.900
How'd they do that?

20:24.401 --> 20:25.902
Plastic surgery.

20:27.404 --> 20:28.905
That's amazing.

20:30.775 --> 20:33.277
You're going to kill David Palmer?

20:36.113 --> 20:37.616
Hey, where's Jack?

20:37.816 --> 20:38.867
I don't know.

20:39.868 --> 20:41.870
I thought you were on the phone with him.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.373
No, that was Division.

20:43.573 --> 20:44.874
Really?

20:48.378 --> 20:51.182
This is a military organization.
There's a chain of command.

20:51.382 --> 20:56.137
I am your superior. I tell you what I
want and you don't question it, got it?

20:56.337 --> 20:57.972
All right. I can accept that.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.724
Good.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.609
There's something you got to deal with.

21:01.809 --> 21:02.912
Yeah? What?

21:03.112 --> 21:05.781
You can boss me around
all you want here...

21:05.981 --> 21:08.784
...but when you and I punch out...

21:08.985 --> 21:10.871
...we're something else...

21:11.071 --> 21:11.872
...okay?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.960
Okay, Tony.

21:17.462 --> 21:18.463
Okay.

21:45.077 --> 21:48.581
Okay, we're clear. Give me
your tie. I want to fix this.

21:54.421 --> 21:55.706
Sorry.

22:08.220 --> 22:09.989
I should've been more careful.

22:10.189 --> 22:12.191
They could have been following Baylor.

22:12.391 --> 22:13.667
This was my fault.

22:13.867 --> 22:15.145
I set it up wrong.

22:16.613 --> 22:18.365
We were sitting ducks.

22:22.069 --> 22:24.622
I'm sorry to put you through this, Jack.

22:24.822 --> 22:27.409
Don't you ever say that to me.

22:27.609 --> 22:29.161
You of all people.

22:29.661 --> 22:30.963
I owe you my life.

22:35.084 --> 22:38.388
Across the mezzanine there's a corridor
that leads to a service exit.

22:38.588 --> 22:40.307
We're gonna take that
straight to the street.

22:40.507 --> 22:42.951
My car is right there. You okay?

22:43.151 --> 22:45.596
Good. Let's get out of here.

23:22.556 --> 23:24.224
Take the wall.

25:03.723 --> 25:04.807
Jack!

25:19.607 --> 25:22.110
We got to find out
who sent these guys.

25:27.282 --> 25:29.285
I'm gonna go ID him.

26:41.001 --> 26:42.002
Hey.

26:45.172 --> 26:46.040
It's okay.

27:07.565 --> 27:10.568
What the hell is this supposed to be?

27:10.768 --> 27:12.370
Give him the ID.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.176
It's okay.

27:17.376 --> 27:19.545
This'll be better for both of us.
I figured it out.

27:20.046 --> 27:22.549
No, you don't figure anything out.
This is not your play.

27:22.749 --> 27:24.334
Now, where is the damn ID?

27:24.534 --> 27:26.136
It is my play...

27:26.336 --> 27:29.674
...since I'm the only one who
knows where the damn ID is.

27:38.066 --> 27:39.519
Go ahead.

28:11.772 --> 28:14.576
I didn't find anything
useful in the back.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.229
Work schedule. Look. Dan... Tuesday,
Wednesday and Friday.

28:18.429 --> 28:19.815
Great. Is there a contact number?

28:20.316 --> 28:22.318
No. We can't get in the office, it's locked.

28:22.518 --> 28:23.986
My husband might be able to help us.

28:24.486 --> 28:25.989
How would he be able to do that?

28:26.489 --> 28:27.991
This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.

28:28.191 --> 28:29.876
He turned his cell phone off.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.680
How would your husband be able to help?

28:32.880 --> 28:36.300
He works for the government, has
access to things. Hang on.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.605
CTU, Nina Myers.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.807
Hi, Nina, it's Teri Bauer.

28:42.007 --> 28:43.308
Is Jack there?

28:44.309 --> 28:45.812
Teri, Jack's not here.

28:46.012 --> 28:48.932
He turned his phone off.
I wonder if you could help me.

28:49.132 --> 28:50.233
Sure, what do you need?

28:50.433 --> 28:54.488
I need the name and number of the owner
of a furniture store in the Valley...

28:54.688 --> 28:56.540
...in Van Nuys, uh, Paladio's Furniture.

28:56.740 --> 29:00.779
That's not something I should do. Can
I wait 'til I talk to Jack about it?

29:00.979 --> 29:02.163
No, not really, um...

29:03.365 --> 29:04.667
Nina, it's Kim.

29:04.867 --> 29:08.454
She took off with some kids I don't know.
One of the boys, Dan, works here.

29:08.654 --> 29:09.755
I was hoping to contact the owner.

29:12.175 --> 29:13.977
All right, um...

29:14.177 --> 29:17.014
Give me a minute, I'll see what I
can do. What's your number?

29:21.386 --> 29:22.870
- Hey!
- Hey.

29:23.070 --> 29:24.356
There you are.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.141
Heard you guys had quite a turnout tonight.

29:26.642 --> 29:27.860
Yeah, it was pretty insane.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.865
I thought I heard the sound of
the young and the reckless generation.

29:32.065 --> 29:34.534
- Dad, what are you doing up?
- How you doing?

29:35.035 --> 29:36.036
Not enough hours in the day.

29:36.236 --> 29:36.838
Hey, Dad.

29:37.038 --> 29:38.372
How did it go?

29:38.572 --> 29:39.707
Mom, it was huge.

29:39.907 --> 29:41.225
I wish you could've been there.

29:41.425 --> 29:42.743
Wish I could have been there, too.

29:43.245 --> 29:44.963
I'm dead. See you guys in the morning.

29:45.163 --> 29:46.432
Okay, good night.

29:46.632 --> 29:50.086
Make sure you get some good rest because
they're going to wake you up early.

29:50.586 --> 29:51.904
I will. Good night.

29:52.104 --> 29:53.423
I love you, honey.

29:56.092 --> 29:58.479
- So, how was it?
- Ah, Dad, it was unbelievable.

29:58.896 --> 30:01.815
The chancellor introduces me, right?
I'm totally killing.

30:02.316 --> 30:05.854
Just as I'm finishing, Green Day
starts to play "Time of Your Life."

30:06.054 --> 30:07.656
- Mom, it was huge.
- Hold on.

30:07.856 --> 30:10.860
The kids were going insane.
Girls were screaming...

30:12.361 --> 30:13.663
Carl?

30:13.863 --> 30:14.864
What's the problem?

30:15.364 --> 30:17.117
I got a call tonight from Maureen Kingsley.

30:17.501 --> 30:18.302
Yeah, so what?

30:18.502 --> 30:20.504
I don't want to talk about
it over the phone.

30:20.704 --> 30:22.757
Okay, I'll come by in the morning.

30:22.957 --> 30:25.009
No. We need to take care of this now.

30:28.847 --> 30:30.849
It's hard to know with teenage girls...

30:31.350 --> 30:33.519
...if they're angry at you or just angry.

30:34.019 --> 30:35.322
I know.

30:35.522 --> 30:39.776
I did feel guilty, though,
when Jack and I separated.

30:39.976 --> 30:41.611
Separated? I didn't know.

30:42.563 --> 30:44.448
We're back together.

30:44.648 --> 30:45.750
I admire that.

30:45.950 --> 30:48.754
Trying to work through
the problems together.

30:48.954 --> 30:52.324
My ex left and never looked back.
Went home to Australia.

30:54.409 --> 30:58.998
She hasn't spoken with Janet
or me for almost 10 years.

30:59.198 --> 31:00.967
I'm really sorry, Alan.

31:12.931 --> 31:14.333
- Hello?
- Teri, I got it.

31:14.533 --> 31:15.935
Oh, great. Hang on a second.

31:17.103 --> 31:18.604
All right, go ahead.

31:20.106 --> 31:23.777
Nina, that's great. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

31:23.977 --> 31:25.779
Okay, 'bye.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.051
Owner's name and phone number.

31:30.251 --> 31:33.254
You have reached the Nowrastehs.
Please leave a message.

31:33.454 --> 31:34.557
Is anybody home?

31:34.757 --> 31:37.226
Mr. Nowrasteh,
if you're there, please pick up.

31:37.426 --> 31:40.930
My daughter is out with one of the
boys who works at your store, Dan.

31:41.431 --> 31:43.933
I need to talk to you. I'm here
in your store right now.

31:44.133 --> 31:44.934
Please call me.

31:45.435 --> 31:46.938
My name is Teri, and my number is...

31:47.138 --> 31:51.142
He said, "Tell your dad to reserve the
Lincoln Bedroom for us on our tour."

31:51.342 --> 31:53.445
I'll bet he did.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.782
Hello, Mrs. Palmer. I'm Aaron
Pierce, Secret Service.

31:59.401 --> 32:01.170
Is there a problem?

32:01.370 --> 32:03.206
I need to speak with the Senator.

32:04.707 --> 32:07.211
All right, I'll go get him for you.

32:14.085 --> 32:15.086
David?

32:17.055 --> 32:18.556
Where is he, Patty?

32:18.840 --> 32:20.559
I don't know. I thought he was in there.

32:20.759 --> 32:22.478
Palmer has left. He's exposed. Find him.

32:22.978 --> 32:24.480
Tell me what's going on?

32:24.980 --> 32:27.984
If he left in one of the
vehicles, it'll show up on our GPS.

32:28.184 --> 32:29.286
Would you tell me what's going on?

32:29.486 --> 32:32.990
We've been told to add another layer
of security around your husband.

32:33.190 --> 32:34.492
Why?

32:34.992 --> 32:35.993
We have a very high confidence...

32:36.494 --> 32:39.498
...that there will be an attempt
on his life sometime today.

33:50.630 --> 33:53.132
- Stay close, Richard.
- I'm right behind you.

34:01.025 --> 34:02.643
I'm going to get you out of here.

34:04.646 --> 34:06.114
Jack...

34:09.367 --> 34:11.320
Jack, listen to me.

34:12.237 --> 34:15.291
Take this card and give it to Jamey.

34:15.791 --> 34:17.860
Baylor said that we could trust her.

34:18.061 --> 34:19.929
Richard, don't move. You'll draw fire.

34:20.130 --> 34:24.802
Take the card, give it to Jamey,
she'll match it to a computer.

34:25.002 --> 34:28.556
Find the computer, you've
got the dirty agent

34:29.558 --> 34:30.759
Richard!

35:41.307 --> 35:41.808
Farrell.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.601
Jamey, it's me.

35:43.801 --> 35:44.895
What do you need?

35:45.095 --> 35:47.898
Two agency personnel were killed
tonight at 2350 Dunlop Plaza.

35:48.098 --> 35:50.518
I need you to phone Division,
get their bodies picked up.

35:50.718 --> 35:52.570
- Okay.
- That's not all.

35:52.770 --> 35:55.273
You know the key cards we use
to get in and out of Division?

35:55.473 --> 35:56.775
- Yeah?
- I've got one.

35:57.275 --> 36:01.280
I need you to pull some data off it for me.
Do you have anything that can read it?

36:01.480 --> 36:04.283
Yeah, but if you're in your car you
can just send it to me now.

36:04.483 --> 36:06.952
- How?
- Use your mobile scanner.

36:07.152 --> 36:09.623
Switch it from optical to magnetic.

36:09.823 --> 36:11.091
Hold on.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.396
I'm sending this to you directly.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.983
You should be able to trace this
to the person who encoded it.

36:33.183 --> 36:35.486
Yeah, I can match the electronic signature.

36:35.686 --> 36:36.904
Good, do it.

36:52.672 --> 36:53.674
Come on.

36:54.175 --> 36:55.142
What are you going to do to me?

36:55.342 --> 36:56.927
Take you to the prom.

36:58.813 --> 36:59.615
Come on, get out.

36:59.815 --> 37:01.116
Don't worry, it's going to be okay.

37:01.316 --> 37:05.103
Just tell her what you want her
to do and then she'll do it.

37:11.194 --> 37:12.696
I said, "Get out!"

37:19.871 --> 37:21.506
It's time to call Mommy.

37:22.006 --> 37:26.178
Tell her you're at a party, you're sorry
and you'll see her in a couple hours.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.180
Go to hell!

37:28.380 --> 37:31.100
Gaines said not to hurt her, remember?

37:34.604 --> 37:35.605
Fine.

37:49.488 --> 37:50.489
Call your mom!

38:00.751 --> 38:01.652
Hello?

38:01.852 --> 38:02.553
Mom?

38:02.753 --> 38:04.756
Kim, is that you?

38:05.257 --> 38:06.057
Hello?

38:06.257 --> 38:07.058
Mom?

38:07.842 --> 38:09.094
Honey, where are you?

38:09.427 --> 38:10.428
I'm at a party.

38:10.628 --> 38:11.731
What?

38:11.931 --> 38:13.616
I'm at a party.

38:13.816 --> 38:15.067
With Janet York, right?

38:15.267 --> 38:15.651
Yeah.

38:15.851 --> 38:17.153
How did you know that?

38:17.353 --> 38:19.448
I'm standing here with her dad.

38:19.648 --> 38:21.742
Do you know how worried we were?

38:21.942 --> 38:23.277
Can I talk to Janet?

38:23.610 --> 38:25.496
Listen, Janet's dad wants to talk to her.

38:25.914 --> 38:26.915
She went for a walk.

38:27.115 --> 38:28.116
She'll call when she gets back.

38:28.616 --> 38:30.084
She went for a walk.

38:30.586 --> 38:33.622
We're okay and I'm sorry
I did this, I mean it.

38:34.123 --> 38:35.925
I'll be home as soon as I get a ride back.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.053
You're not going to wait for a ride back.

38:38.253 --> 38:40.367
We'll come pick you up. Where are you?

38:40.567 --> 38:42.682
I don't even know how we got here.

38:42.882 --> 38:43.985
Kim?

38:44.185 --> 38:46.771
Honey, this is not the night
you want to shine me on.

38:46.971 --> 38:48.606
- I promise you!
- Mom, I got to go.

38:48.940 --> 38:49.357
Kim.

38:49.557 --> 38:51.059
Mom, I love you.

38:54.646 --> 38:56.064
"I love you."

38:57.567 --> 38:58.985
Nice touch.

38:59.986 --> 39:01.204
Get in the van.

39:01.404 --> 39:02.422
What happened?

39:02.622 --> 39:04.166
I can't believe it.

39:04.366 --> 39:05.709
She's at this party.

39:05.909 --> 39:08.662
She said she was sorry
and that she'd be back.

39:08.862 --> 39:11.249
- And what about Janet?
- She's fine.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.089
What's wrong?

39:18.090 --> 39:19.592
She said, "I love you."

39:21.093 --> 39:22.596
She never says that.

39:29.687 --> 39:32.190
Ok, Jack, I got a match
on the card you sent me.

39:32.390 --> 39:33.191
Need a confidence on this?

39:33.691 --> 39:35.109
