WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:09.477
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.746
AND THREE,

00:12.780 --> 00:14.615
TWO, ONE...

00:14.648 --> 00:16.750
THERE THEY ARE.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.320
OH, WELL, THANKS FOR WAITING
UP FOR US, GRANDMA.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.155
- HI, JOE.
- FLETCHER.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.756
IT IS 11:00 ON THE DOT.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.025
THE LAST THREE TIMES YOU GUYS
WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR,

00:25.059 --> 00:27.461
IT'S BEEN EXACTLY 11:00.
YOU'RE LIKE A CUCKOO CLOCK.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.064
WELL, HE'S VERY RELIABLE.
HE'S VERY PUNCTUAL.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.633
I KNOW HOW RELIABILITY GETS
YOU ALL HOT AND BOTHERED,

00:32.666 --> 00:36.204
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
PUNCTUAL KIDS ALONE.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.208
I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME TONIGHT.
IT WAS A GOOD RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.310
YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT RESTAURANT,
GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.545
IF MY MOTHER HAD SHOWN UP SOBER
TO SAY SHE WAS PROUD OF ME,

00:44.578 --> 00:46.747
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
OFF THE CHARTS.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.783
I'M SORRY, YOU WERE WAITING
FOR YOUR MOTHER TONIGHT?

00:49.817 --> 00:52.453
NO NO NO, IT WAS
JUST A LITTLE JOKE.

00:52.486 --> 00:56.290
AH. OH, I GET IT NOW.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.227
- SOMETIMES IT TAKES ME A LITTLE...
- I KNOW.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.096
SO CAN I CALL YOU TOMORROW?

01:02.130 --> 01:03.664
SURE, YOU CAN.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.600
- IS 4:00 OKAY?
- SURPRISE ME.

01:06.634 --> 01:10.238
OKAY, SOMETIME BETWEEN
4:00 AND 4:30.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.573
OOH, THE SUSPENSE.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.646
SO THREE DATES IN A ROW
WITH THE SAME GUY, HUH?

01:18.679 --> 01:20.814
HAS FLETCHER FINALLY CRACKED
THE MEL BURKE CODE?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.817
WELL, HE KEEPS ASKING ME
OUT AND I KEEP SAYING YES.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.154
I MEAN, A GIRL'S GOT TO EAT.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.425
THAT IS SO INCREDIBLY ROMANTIC.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.594
SO YOU GONNA CUT HIM LOOSE SOON

01:33.627 --> 01:36.397
OR SQUEEZE A FEW MORE FANCY
MEALS OUT OF HIM FIRST?

01:36.430 --> 01:40.334
OH, BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT
SQUEEZING ANYTHING.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.203
HE'S NOT... I... I DON'T KNOW.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.505
I JUST DON'T THINK THIS THING
HAS ANY LEGS, YOU KNOW?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.374
HE'S A PERFECTLY NICE GUY.

01:46.407 --> 01:50.211
WORDS THAT HAVE
NEVER PRECEDED SEX.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.712
THE PROBLEM WITH HIM IS...

01:51.745 --> 01:53.447
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
PROBLEM WITH HIM IS.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.483
YOU FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH
EVERY GUY THAT YOU GO OUT WITH.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.218
- NOT TRUE.
- OF COURSE IT IS.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.587
CHARLIE STARED AT YOU TOO
ROMANTICALLY, RIGHT?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.322
IT MADE YOU ALL NAUSEOUS.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.691
AND THEN THERE WAS JONATHAN
WITH THOSE MASSAGES.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.826
YEAH, WELL, HIS HANDS
WERE COLD AND SLIMY.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.496
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE WHEN I
TOUCHED THE EEL AT THE AQUARIUM,

02:08.529 --> 02:11.199
BUT AT LEAST THE EEL HAD
A LITTLE ELECTRICITY.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.434
AND THEN THERE WAS THAT OTHER
GUY YOU WENT OUT WITH.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.802
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN?
- SASHA.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.338
YEAH, SASHA. WHAT
WAS WRONG WITH HIM?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.707
UH, HIS NAME WAS SASHA.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.643
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I'LL
GIVE YOU THAT ONE.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.179
I TELL YOU, YOU REALLY DO FIND
THE FLAWS IN EVERYONE THOUGH.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.481
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT WITH ME.
GOD KNOWS WHAT YOU'D FIND WRONG.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.885
OH, DO YOU WANT THE FULL LIST, THE
TOP 10, OR JUST THE BULLET POINTS?

02:31.919 --> 02:36.590
- YOU HAVE A LIST?
- DO I HAVE A LIST?

02:36.624 --> 02:40.194
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE. FOR STARTERS,
YOUR ARMS... YEAH, THEY'RE WAY TOO BIG.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.664
AND, OH, YOU ALWAYS HAVE
AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.566
- THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE...
- EH EH EH EH EH.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.568
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWAGGER
INTO EVERY WOMAN'S LIFE

02:47.601 --> 02:49.603
WITH YOUR TOOL BELT AND
HAMMER AWAY AT HER PROBLEM.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.772
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T
HAMMER AWAY; I FIX.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.875
- OH, WHAT IF WE DON'T NEED FIXING?
- AH, WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.644
OH OH OH OH!

07:33.854 --> 07:35.989
LAUGH-A-MINUTE FLETCHER?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.792
YEAH, LOOK, JOE, I WAS THINKING
A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

07:38.826 --> 07:42.462

MEN AWAY AND FINDING FLAWS.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.197
AND YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.568
YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S PERFECT AND I
THINK I'M GONNA GIVE FLETCHER A TRY.

07:47.601 --> 07:51.972
BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER, THE MUSIC
STOPS AND YOU GOTTA SIT DOWN.

07:52.005 --> 07:56.710
THIS MUSIC YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
DOES ANYBODY ELSE HEAR IT?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.746
IS IT LIKE A POLKA?

08:10.123 --> 08:13.561
HEY, WHERE THE HECK IS RYDER?
I CALLED HIM 10 MINUTES AGO.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.228
IT'S HIS TURN TO SET
THE TABLE TONIGHT.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.497
HE'S COMING, HE'S COMING.

08:17.531 --> 08:21.802
SORRY, JOE, I'M SO HIP
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.138
WOW, THOSE ARE SOME...
SOME TIGHT PANTS, BRO.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.075
ARE ALL YOUR PARTS OKAY?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.978
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T
FEEL THOSE EITHER.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.747
YOU'D BETTER GET USED TO THOSE PANTS IF
YOU'RE WEARING THEM TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.584
- ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WAY?
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST WEAR SOMETHING

08:36.617 --> 08:39.887
FROM YOUR INVISIBLE LOSER
COLLECTION AND SEE HOW THAT GOES?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.822
YOU LOOK GOOD. SUCK IT UP.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.925
BELIEVE ME, EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE IS SUCKED UP.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.061
- SO WHO'S THE GIRL?
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE'S A GIRL?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.930
THERE'S GOT TO BE A GIRL.
NOBODY'S GONNA

08:49.963 --> 08:53.667
SQUASH HIS GRAPES FOR THE GUYS.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.736
LET'S WALK YOU AROUND THE
BLOCK AND GET YOU USED TO IT.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.606
- I CAN'T DO IT.
- THINK OF KIRSTEN.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.942
KIRSTEN, KIRSTEN, KIRSTEN.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.944
IT'S NOT WORKING.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
- HELLO.
- HEY.

09:05.979 --> 09:10.150
WOW, NICE JEANS. I
HAVE THE SAME ONES.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.753
I'LL BET IN THE SAME SIZE.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.795
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

09:21.829 --> 09:23.864
- I'M WAITING FOR MEL.
- OH.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.933
SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.701
AND THEN I STOPPED LISTENING.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.803
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.572
WHAT ARE THEY DOING BACK HERE?
THEY SHOULD BE ON DISPLAY.

09:32.606 --> 09:36.610
OOH, I WAS RIGHT.
THEY'RE FROM FLETCHER.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.680
BOY, BACK FROM THE DEAD, HUH?
WHO SAW THAT COMING?

09:39.713 --> 09:42.950
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
- WHO SAYS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

09:42.983 --> 09:46.687
THINGS GET RAISED FROM
THE DEAD ALL THE TIME.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.256
STEPHANIE, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
SHE WAS ABOUT READY TO DUMP HIM.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.124
NOW SHE'S SNIFFING HIS FLOWERS.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.027
BETWEEN THOSE TWO POINTS IN TIME
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.597
UH UM, I'M GONNA GO HELP
MEL WITH HER SHOES.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.899
- COMING, MEL.
- STEPHANIE.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.736
UM, ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING
DIFFERENT WITH YOUR HAIR?

10:02.770 --> 10:06.907
UH, MAYBE I WASHED IT.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.780
IT'S... IT'S THIS SHAMPOO.
IT'S GOT...

10:15.749 --> 10:19.653
ESSENCE OF COCONUT IN IT.
IT'S REALLY JUST NOT FAIR.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.789
ALL THE FOXY FIVE ARE
COUPLED UP EXCEPT FOR MEL

10:21.822 --> 10:25.693
AND SHE'S TOTALLY WIGGING OUT. SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY SINGLE FOXY.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.095
I'M SO WEAK.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.731
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORANGE JUICE?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.933
SORRY I HAD TO DO
THAT TO YOU, STEPH.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.337
DON'T BE. BEING SNIFFED BY YOU
IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.309
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO LUNCH?

10:42.342 --> 10:45.746
WELL HELLO, LUNCH.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.848
I'M SORRY. BACKSPACE BACKSPACE.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.850
I'D BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE LUNCH.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.854
OH, BUT BEFORE WE GO,
LOOK WHAT I GOT FOR US...

10:53.887 --> 10:57.090
TICKETS TO SEE RICKY
GERVAIS LIVE FRIDAY NIGHT,

10:57.124 --> 10:59.192
THE TOLEDO OPERA HOUSE,
THE FOUNDER'S BOX.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.395
WE'LL BE LIKE THOSE OLD
MEN IN "THE MUPPETS."

11:02.429 --> 11:04.998
RICKY GERVAIS, YEAH, HE'S
THAT GUY FROM THE...

11:05.032 --> 11:09.236
AND HE WAS IN THAT... WAIT,
WHO'S RICKY GERVAIS AGAIN?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.938
HE'S THE FUNNY COMEDIAN.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.106
AND I'D LOVE TO GO BUT
I'M DRIVING TO CHICAGO

11:13.140 --> 11:15.108
FOR MY PARENTS' 40th
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.810
- RAIN CHECK?
- YEAH.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.979
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS TO SEE THE
FUNNIEST GUY ON THE PLANET?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.981
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S THE
FUNNIEST GUY IN THE UNIVERSE.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.050
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THOSE
COMEDY CLUBS ON MARS,

11:23.083 --> 11:24.852
YOU CAN HEAR THE
LAUGHS ON JUPITER.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.754
I LOVE HOW YOU TALK.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.757
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, BUT I ENJOY YOUR MELODY.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.960
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT MEL IS SHORT FOR.
GET IT?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.227
AH.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.730
I'M SO MUCH FUNNIER AROUND YOU.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.131
REALLY?

11:38.165 --> 11:41.034
UM, YOU KNOW, CHICAGO...

11:41.068 --> 11:43.703
THAT'S A LONG TRIP TO
TAKE ALL BY YOURSELF.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.873
MAYBE YOU NEED SOMEONE TO
COME WITH YOU, YOU KNOW?

11:45.906 --> 11:48.041
SOMEONE TO KEEP YOU COMPANY;
SOMEONE CUTE AND FUN

11:48.075 --> 11:50.844
WHO MAKES YOU LAUGH.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.980
- ME, FLETCHER. ME.
- OH GOOD.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.382
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THAT RICKY GERVAIS GUY AGAIN.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.118
REALLY? YOU'D COME WITH ME?

11:58.151 --> 12:01.254
WELL, NOW THAT YOU ASK, YEAH.
YEAH I WOULD.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.256
OH, THIS IS AMAZING.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.759
WOW, THIS IS KIND OF
A BIG STEP FOR US.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.428
YOU MEETING MY ENTIRE
FAMILY IN ONE FELL SWOOP?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.997
YEAH WELL, I AM READY
FOR THAT SWOOP.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.398
YOU SURE IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TOO SOON?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.166
NO. NO, IT'S GOOD.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.070
YEAH, I HAVE NO SECOND
THOUGHTS AT ALL... AT ALL!

12:20.173 --> 12:23.210
RYDER, LENNOX, SCHOOL RIGHT NOW!

12:25.012 --> 12:27.714
- OH HEY, GOOD MORNING.
- ACTUALLY FANTASTIC MORNING.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.983
WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH WATCHING
THE KIDS FOR THE WEEKEND?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.819
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GOING AWAY ON A TRIP.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.854
I HAVE A DATE PLANNED
SOMEWHERE IN THERE.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.889
BUT YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?
I GUESS LEAVING THE KIDS

12:35.923 --> 12:38.191
HOME ALONE FOR A FEW HOURS
UNATTENDED WILL BE OKAY.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.927
SO YEAH, RUN LIKE THE WIND.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.862
YOU AND THE LADIES
HAVE A FOXY WEEKEND.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.730
OH, I'M NOT GOING
WITH THE FOXIES.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.999
NO, THIS IS A GOING-AWAY-
WITH-FLETCHER WEEKEND

12:46.033 --> 12:49.336
TO CHICAGO FOR HIS PARENTS' 40th
ANNIVERSARY WINGDING-THING.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.339
WOW, THE WHOLE FAMILY?
THAT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.274
IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.044
I MEAN, JUDGING FROM FLETCHER
AND THE HISTORY OF GENETICS,

12:57.077 --> 12:58.411
THAT SOUNDS SERIOUS...

12:58.445 --> 13:01.982
AS IN, YOU KNOW, NOT
A LOT OF LAUGHS.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.750
NO, HE'S GETTING FUNNIER, OKAY?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.318
THE OTHER DAY HE
MADE SORT OF A JOKE.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.987
IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF SWEET.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.824
HE SAID MY NAME, MEL, AND THAT IT
WAS PROBABLY SHORT FOR MELODY.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.527
( sarcastically )
THAT IS HILARIOUS.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.130
SO SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE
HECK IS GOING ON HERE?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.032
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT THE
HECK'S GOING ON HERE?

13:19.066 --> 13:21.869
I KNOW YOU HATE WHEN I SAY THINGS
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE...

13:21.902 --> 13:24.771
- BUT YOU SAY THEM ANYWAY.
- BECAUSE THEY'RE VALUABLE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY

13:24.804 --> 13:27.040
- YOU APPRECIATE THEM.
- OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.209
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
SORRY SORRY SORRY.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.544
UH, FOR A GIRL?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.413
YEAH, FOR A GIRL.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.415
JOE, SHOULDN'T WE BE
GETTING TO SCHOOL?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.550
WHAT ARE YOU, THE VICE PRINCIPAL?
WE'LL LEAVE WHEN WE LEAVE.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.888
- BUT YOU SAID...
- TWO MINUTES.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.155
OKAY.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.424
HEY, RYDER, YOU NEED
ANY MONEY FOR LUNCH?

13:44.457 --> 13:48.828
NO, NOTHING COULD
FIT IN MY POCKETS.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.830
HEY, I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.299
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.834
YOU ARE PRETENDING TO LIKE
FLETCHER BUT YOU DON'T, OKAY?

13:54.868 --> 13:57.270
THERE, I SAID IT. WE WERE BOTH THINKING
IT, BUT NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.173
NOBODY WAS THINKING IT. AND I AM
NOT PRETENDING TO LIKE FLETCHER.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.075
- YES YOU ARE.
- NO I'M NOT.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.278
HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY WHOSE CHARMS I
DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE AT FIRST...

14:05.312 --> 14:06.947
OH, COME ON, THAT IS SUCH BULL.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.349
ALL YOUR COLLEGE FRIENDS ARE
EITHER MARRIED OR GETTING MARRIED

14:09.382 --> 14:11.051
AND NOW YOU'RE UP
THERE ALL ALONE.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.353
THERE'S ONE LAST MARRIAGE
HELICOPTER AND IT'S CIRCLING

14:13.386 --> 14:15.422
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOME
BORING GUY REACHES OUT

14:15.455 --> 14:19.192
AND HE GOES, "COME ON, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER. JUST GIVE ME YOUR HAND."

14:19.226 --> 14:23.030
OH, SO BEING SINGLE IS
LIKE THE FALL OF SAIGON?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.298
ACCORDING TO THE FOXY LADIES.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.400
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT ANYWAY?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.202
I HAVE MY SOURCES.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.539
OKAY, SO YOU SAID FIVE OR SIX NICE
THINGS TO STEPHANIE AND SHE SPILLED.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.141
ONLY TOOK TWO.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.076
LOOK, YOU ARE SETTLING
AND YOU KNOW IT.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.610
I AM NOT SETTLING, OKAY?

14:37.644 --> 14:40.013
I AM RECONSIDERING BASED
ON CURRENT OPTIONS.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.148
- SETTLING.
- AM NOT.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.415
- ARE TOO.
- NO I'M NOT.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.284
- I'M GOING WITH FLETCHER.
- HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.485
FINE, I WILL. OH, AND HERE.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.387
TWO TICKETS TO RICKY GERVAIS.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.056
OH, THE FUNNIEST
GUY ON THE PLANET.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.590
YEAH, I KNOW. ENJOY.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.592
ARE WE GOING TO SCHOOL?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.627
WILL YOU GET A LIFE?

15:01.334 --> 15:05.038
WELL, I AM ALL READY FOR OUR
BIG WEEKEND WITH YOUR PARENTS.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.607
WHAT WEEKEND?

15:07.640 --> 15:10.377
HUH HUH? HAD YOU GOING THERE.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.613
- I'M ON A ROLL, RIGHT?
- YEAH, YOU ARE A PISTOL.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.516
ALL RIGHT, SO JUST DON'T DO THAT
AGAIN, 'CAUSE YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.018
OKAY.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.420
ALL RIGHT, SO I WILL
SEE YOU SUNDAY.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.555
- HAVE A GOOD TIME.
- THANKS.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.426
SO BYE.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.095
BYE.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.997
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HIT
THE ROAD, JACK.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.033
- I'M FLETCHER.
- YEAH, I KNOW, HONEY.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.636
( knocking )

15:36.669 --> 15:38.638
KIRSTEN. COME IN, COME IN.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.374
SO YOUR BROTHER LEFT
THESE IN CLASS TODAY.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.510
ACTUALLY HE DROPPED THEM
AND RAN WHEN I SAID HI.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.279
BUT, YOU KNOW, I FIGURED RYDER MIGHT
NEED THEM FOR HOMEWORK. OKAY?

15:46.313 --> 15:49.416
WAIT. YOU KNOW MY
BROTHER'S NAME?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.418
YEAH. WE SHARE A TABLE
IN EARTH SCIENCE.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.420
WE ACTUALLY MADE A
FAKE FOSSIL TOGETHER.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.989
OH, YEAH, HE SLEEPS WITH THAT THING.
I MEAN...

15:56.023 --> 15:57.624
HE KEEPS IT ON HIS NIGHTSTAND.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.293
SO IS HE OKAY?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.662
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN ACTING
SO STRANGE THIS WEEK

16:02.695 --> 16:04.164
- AND DRESSING SO...
- WEIRD?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.699
- YEAH.
- LISTEN, ABOUT RYDER...

16:06.733 --> 16:10.570
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER,
YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT?

16:10.603 --> 16:13.373
SURE, IF HE JUST DROPPED
THIS THING HE'S DOING,

16:13.406 --> 16:17.077
YOU KNOW, WITH THE CLOTHES. HE'S
HAVING SOME TROUBLE WALKING.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.147
I THINK HE HAS,
LIKE, A HIP INJURY.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.949
HEY, LENNOX... OH MY GOD.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.951
YOU'RE HERE IN MY
HOUSE AND I'M...

16:24.984 --> 16:27.187
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE
INTO MY REAL CLOTHES.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.956
STOP.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.060
GO BACK TO LOSER. SHE LIKES IT.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.296
REALLY? SO NO MORE SKINNY JEANS?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.131
NOPE.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.369
- HI.
- HI.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.437
PROBLEM SOLVED.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.541
IT'S LIKE WATCHING PUPPIES.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.679
DENISE, HEY, IT'S JOE.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.415
YEAH, I WAS JUST CALLING TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE STILL ON FOR 8:00 TONIGHT.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.085
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, PERFECT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.454
OH, AND GUESS WHAT? I GOT US TWO
TICKETS TO SEE RICKY GERVAIS.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.423
HUH?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.158
GERVAIS.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.161
HE... HE'S A COMEDIAN.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.730
YEAH, I'M SURE, DENISE.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.432
MM-HMM.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.766
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, WELL,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.602
YEAH OKAY, THEN I'LL
BE THERE AT 8:00.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.205
ALL RIGHT. GOOGLE
HIM, ALL RIGHT?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.207
BYE-BYE.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.743
I THINK SHE'S RELATED
TO FLETCHER.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.712
KIRSTEN'S OUT THERE.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.680
LONG STORY SHORT, I'M
MAKING THEM POPCORN.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.016
FRESHMEN ARE SO CUTE AND RANDOM.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.152
( phone rings )

17:34.387 --> 17:35.688
LONGO.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.457
HEY, MEL.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.492
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.196
WHAT?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.265
YES.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.167
I'M ON MY WAY.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.469
UH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

17:49.502 --> 17:53.039
SO MAKE SURE YOU FINISH YOUR CHEMISTRY
HOMEWORK AND DON'T BURN THE PLACE DOWN.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.509
AND IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING
WILD AND CRAZY TO DO,

17:56.543 --> 17:58.745
JUST DON'T DO IT.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.550
( bus horn blows )

18:03.583 --> 18:07.354
MEL? HE LEFT YOU IN A REST
STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.556
WHAT KIND OF A GUY LEAVES A
WOMAN IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.659
JOE, CALM DOWN, OKAY? THANK YOU FOR
COMING, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

18:12.692 --> 18:14.694
NO, I WANT TO WRING HIS LITTLE
SCRAWNY LAWYER NECK OUT.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.330
- HOW COULD A GUY DO THIS TO YOU?
- JOE, I DID THIS TO ME.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.832
YOU... WAIT A MINUTE. IS
THIS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

18:19.866 --> 18:23.170
WHERE I'M GETTING A LITTLE HOT-HEADED
AND HOMICIDAL FOR NO REASON?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.471
YEP.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.440
SO HOW DID WE END UP IN...

18:27.474 --> 18:29.542
IN THAT GUY'S LIVING ROOM?

18:29.576 --> 18:33.580
( sighs ) WELL, WERE ABOUT
AN HOUR INTO THE TRIP

18:33.613 --> 18:37.450
AND I JUST IMAGINED ME AND
FLETCHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW

18:37.484 --> 18:39.719
IN THE SAME CAR WITH THREE
KIDS IN THE BACK SEAT

18:39.752 --> 18:41.754
- AND I JUST...
- PANICKED?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.123
YEAH, WHAT'S A STRONGER
WORD THAN THAT?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.692
UH, MENTALLY HURLED? YEAH.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.428
I MEAN, THAT'S TWO WORDS,
BUT YOU GET THE IDEA.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.797
WE STOPPED FOR GAS AND
FLETCHER WENT INSIDE TO PAY

18:50.830 --> 18:52.565
AND I JUST... I JUMPED
OUT OF THE CAR.

18:52.599 --> 18:56.303
I LEFT MY CELL PHONE AND MY BAGS
AND I JUST STARTED WALKING...

18:56.336 --> 18:57.837
OKAY, RUNNING.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.509
WOW. I'M SORRY. I MEAN, HE
SEEMED LIKE HE WAS OKAY.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.446
HE WAS. HE WAS MASSIVELY OKAY.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.217
AND TOGETHER WE WERE
PERFECTLY OKAY.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.452
I JUST WANT MORE
THAN OKAY, YOU KNOW?

19:12.485 --> 19:16.289
- HEY.
- FLETCHER.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.824
I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL
AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.859
THAT'S SO SWEET.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.561
