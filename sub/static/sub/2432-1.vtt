00:19.252 --> 00:24.632
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

00:24.841 --> 00:28.970
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

00:29.178 --> 00:34.517
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit, -

00:34.726 --> 00:38.479
- there's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

00:38.688 --> 00:41.691
No scripts, no cue cards.

00:41.899 --> 00:47.363
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. It's a life.

00:50.950 --> 00:56.080
I'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.546
No way, mister.

01:03.755 --> 01:07.634
You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

01:11.679 --> 01:15.266
Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

01:15.475 --> 01:19.062
You're crazy, you know that?

01:22.398 --> 01:26.903
For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

01:27.111 --> 01:32.492
My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.332
It's a noble life.
It is... a truly blessed life.

01:39.540 --> 01:43.294
Tell me something I don't know.

01:43.503 --> 01:47.173
All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

01:47.382 --> 01:53.513
If I die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

01:53.721 --> 01:55.765
You're gross.

01:59.268 --> 02:01.646
It's all real.

02:01.854 --> 02:07.151
Nothing you see on the show is fake.
It's merely controlled.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.616
THE TRUMAN SHOW

02:14.993 --> 02:19.330
Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

02:20.957 --> 02:24.085
Maybe just your love handles.

02:24.294 --> 02:28.047
I have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

02:28.256 --> 02:32.802
- Truman, you're gonna be late.
- Okay!

02:44.022 --> 02:45.982
DAY 10,909

02:46.190 --> 02:49.736
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

02:49.944 --> 02:55.325
And in case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

02:56.868 --> 03:00.705
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

03:00.913 --> 03:05.335
- He won't hurt you.
- I know. It's just me.

03:05.543 --> 03:08.254
Come on, Pluto.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.653
What is it?

03:51.089 --> 03:56.260
<i>An aircraft began shedding parts</i>
<i>as it flew over Seahaven</i> -

03:56.469 --> 04:00.431
- <i>a few moments ago.</i>
<i>Luckily, no one was hurt.</i>

04:00.640 --> 04:03.851
<i>How do you feel today...?</i>
<i>That's good.</i>

04:04.060 --> 04:07.313
- <i>Thinking of flying somewhere</i> ?
- Nope.

04:07.522 --> 04:12.443
<i>This is classical Klyne.</i>
<i>Forget about the perils of flying</i> -

04:12.652 --> 04:15.989
- <i>and let this music calm you down.</i>

04:18.950 --> 04:23.246
"Dog Fancy", please.
Thank you very much.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.917
Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

04:28.126 --> 04:32.630
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

04:32.839 --> 04:37.176
- That be all for you, Truman?
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.

04:47.478 --> 04:50.273
- Hank!
- Good morning, Truman.

04:50.481 --> 04:55.903
Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

04:56.112 --> 04:59.574
- How's your lovely wife?
- Good. Yours?

04:59.782 --> 05:02.702
Couldn't be better.

05:02.910 --> 05:07.457
- Nice talking to you.
- You too. Think about that policy.

05:07.665 --> 05:11.878
Two for one. That's a good deal.
DoppelgÃ¤nger special.

05:15.757 --> 05:19.594
Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

05:19.802 --> 05:24.515
- Go ahead.
- I'm not that anxious to get there.

05:39.197 --> 05:44.327
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji Islands.

05:44.535 --> 05:47.538
Truman, did you see this?

05:48.373 --> 05:53.211
I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

05:55.004 --> 05:59.342
Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

06:01.302 --> 06:03.596
Nothing listed...

06:03.805 --> 06:09.102
Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

06:10.395 --> 06:14.732
Nothing...
Okay, thank you.

06:50.768 --> 06:56.482
- Lawrence.
- I've got a prospect in Wells Park.

06:58.401 --> 07:03.615
Wells Park?
On... Harbour Island?

07:03.823 --> 07:09.245
- You know another one?
- I can't. I have an appointment.

07:09.454 --> 07:11.706
Dentist, or... yeah.

07:12.123 --> 07:17.003
You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

07:17.211 --> 07:21.758
They're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

07:21.966 --> 07:28.181
You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.559
Thanks.

07:40.068 --> 07:44.948
Hello. Ferry's still here, huh?
Thought I might have missed it.

07:45.156 --> 07:49.285
- One way or return?
- Return.

07:51.412 --> 07:54.791
There you go, sir.

08:50.596 --> 08:55.810
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead, I'll be fine.

09:10.867 --> 09:13.411
Hi, honey.

09:13.620 --> 09:18.499
Look what I got free at
the checkout. It's a "Chef's Pal".

09:18.708 --> 09:23.630
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

09:23.838 --> 09:27.592
Wow... that's amazing.

09:29.010 --> 09:33.264
Truman... you missed a spot.

09:47.362 --> 09:50.657
That is a beer.

09:51.658 --> 09:56.120
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Yeah? Out of what?

09:56.329 --> 10:00.541
Out of my job. Out of Seahaven.
Off this island. Out.

10:00.750 --> 10:06.422
What the hell's wrong with yourjob?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

10:06.631 --> 10:10.009
I'd kill for a desk job.

10:11.552 --> 10:17.809
You should try stocking vending
machines. Now <i>there's</i> excitement.

10:18.017 --> 10:23.356
- Don't you ever get antsy?
- Where's there to go?

10:25.650 --> 10:30.697
- Fiji.
- Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

10:36.577 --> 10:40.873
See here? This is us...

10:41.082 --> 10:45.712
And all the way
around here... Fiji.

10:45.920 --> 10:50.717
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

10:50.925 --> 10:57.223
There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

10:58.182 --> 11:02.395
So when are you gonna go?

11:02.603 --> 11:05.732
It's not that simple.

11:05.940 --> 11:10.028
It takes money, planning...

11:10.236 --> 11:15.033
- You can't just up and go.
- Right.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.911
I'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

11:19.120 --> 11:24.000
Bonus time
is just around the corner.

11:26.336 --> 11:30.048
- Are you coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

11:49.150 --> 11:54.197
<i>I don't like that weather, son.</i>
<i>We should head back.</i>

11:54.405 --> 11:57.492
<i>Just a bit farther. Please?</i>

11:57.700 --> 12:00.662
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

12:02.538 --> 12:04.958
<i>Daddy!</i>

13:18.281 --> 13:21.409
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

13:21.618 --> 13:25.872
- We can scrape together 8,000...
- You and Marlon...

13:26.080 --> 13:30.960
- We can bum around the world.
- And then what?

13:31.169 --> 13:35.882
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

13:36.090 --> 13:43.056
We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

13:43.264 --> 13:48.311
- It would be an adventure.
- We were going to try for a baby.

13:48.519 --> 13:52.815
- Isn't that enough of an adventure?
- That can wait.

13:53.024 --> 13:57.904
I want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

13:58.112 --> 14:01.699
You want to be an explorer...

14:01.908 --> 14:06.704
This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

14:08.957 --> 14:14.629
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

14:14.837 --> 14:21.594
You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

14:21.803 --> 14:25.974
The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

14:30.770 --> 14:35.108
"Dog Fancy", please.
Thank you.

14:37.652 --> 14:40.488
Paper, Earl, please.

14:40.697 --> 14:43.783
I might as well get one of these.

14:43.992 --> 14:47.745
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

14:47.954 --> 14:52.542
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.941
Dad?

15:18.067 --> 15:21.487
Hey, what are you doing?

15:22.739 --> 15:25.992
Get out of the way!

15:27.785 --> 15:32.373
Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

15:32.582 --> 15:37.378
Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

15:37.587 --> 15:42.759
Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

16:04.364 --> 16:07.283
It doesn't sound insane at all.

16:07.492 --> 16:11.120
I see him ten times a week.

16:11.329 --> 16:15.249
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon...

16:15.458 --> 16:19.045
It was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

16:19.253 --> 16:25.718
And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

16:25.927 --> 16:31.182
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.811
They never found Dad's body.

16:35.019 --> 16:41.359
If it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

16:41.567 --> 16:46.739
You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

16:46.948 --> 16:50.368
Just like you.

16:51.661 --> 16:57.959
Sweetie... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

16:58.167 --> 17:01.296
You sailing off into that storm...

17:03.548 --> 17:08.928
But I've never blamed you.
And I don't blame you now.

17:56.017 --> 17:58.603
Truman...?

18:01.230 --> 18:04.776
What are you doing down here?

18:04.984 --> 18:08.237
Fixing the mower.

18:10.365 --> 18:15.453
- I saw my father today.
- I know.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.790
Your mother called.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.793
You shouldn't upset her like that.

18:22.001 --> 18:27.090
- What did you want?
- I made macaroni.

18:27.298 --> 18:30.468
- I'm not hungry.
- You know...

18:30.677 --> 18:34.138
We ought to throw out that mower.

18:34.347 --> 18:38.935
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

19:13.428 --> 19:15.596
What's he doing?

19:15.805 --> 19:20.143
They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

19:20.351 --> 19:23.646
10,910
NUMBER OF DAYS RUNNING

20:13.029 --> 20:18.242
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Sorry I fell on you.

20:18.451 --> 20:24.123
I've been such a klutz all day.
I must have sprained this ankle.

20:24.332 --> 20:29.295
- I'm so sorry to fall on you.
- Don't worry about it.

20:29.504 --> 20:33.967
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

21:59.385 --> 22:03.806
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- I've got to commit this to memory.

22:04.015 --> 22:07.393
Come on, an ice-cold brewsky.

22:07.602 --> 22:11.522
You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.693
You're a better person than I am.

22:15.902 --> 22:19.030
- See you later.
- Bye.

22:19.238 --> 22:22.116
See you later, loser.

23:21.759 --> 23:24.512
Hi.

23:27.098 --> 23:30.268
- <i>Konnichi-wa.</i>
- What?

23:30.476 --> 23:35.189
- You take Japanese.
- Oh, yes...

23:37.984 --> 23:40.486
Lauren, right?

23:40.695 --> 23:44.949
- It's on the...
- Lauren, right.

23:45.158 --> 23:50.580
- I'm Truman Burbank.
- Yeah, I know.

23:50.788 --> 23:55.793
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Really?

23:57.962 --> 24:03.468
- I'm a pretty dangerous character.
- I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

24:05.053 --> 24:09.432
Girls have got to be careful.

24:09.641 --> 24:13.186
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- It's not that.

24:13.394 --> 24:18.524
Was it Meryl, the girl I was with?
We're not... We're just friends.

24:18.733 --> 24:22.779
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look? Not your type?

24:24.614 --> 24:27.241
No.

24:27.450 --> 24:29.410
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

24:29.619 --> 24:33.289
I was wondering that myself.

24:33.498 --> 24:39.754
Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

24:39.963 --> 24:43.925
- Like, Friday? Saturday?
- I can't.

24:44.133 --> 24:46.803
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

24:47.011 --> 24:49.138
NOW

24:50.556 --> 24:54.394
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

24:54.602 --> 24:59.607
If we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

24:59.816 --> 25:03.444
So what do you want to do?

25:35.977 --> 25:39.188
Please keep your hands
inside the car!

25:55.997 --> 26:01.919
This is my favourite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

26:02.128 --> 26:06.382
We have so little time.
They'll be here any minute.

26:06.591 --> 26:11.638
- They don't want me talking to you.
- Then don't talk.

26:25.234 --> 26:27.904
They're here.

26:28.112 --> 26:32.033
- What do they want?
- Listen to me.

26:32.241 --> 26:37.538
Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending. Understand?

26:37.747 --> 26:43.419
- My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

26:43.628 --> 26:46.756
- Who are you?
- Her father.

26:46.965 --> 26:51.177
I've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

26:51.386 --> 26:55.098
Everything I've told you
is the truth.

26:55.306 --> 27:00.603
It's fake. It's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

27:00.812 --> 27:05.900
Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

27:06.109 --> 27:10.947
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

27:11.155 --> 27:16.786
Hypnotism, shock therapy...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

27:16.995 --> 27:21.791
- She brings all her boys down here.
- Truman, he's lying!

27:22.000 --> 27:24.794
Get out of here. Come and find me.

27:25.003 --> 27:29.924
- I'll see you in school.
- We're moving to Fiji.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.354
Sylvia! Hey!

27:53.323 --> 27:58.411
- Why didn't he just follow her?
- His mother got really sick.

27:58.620 --> 28:02.874
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

28:03.082 --> 28:07.128
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

28:07.337 --> 28:12.675
Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

28:24.646 --> 28:29.484
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

28:59.806 --> 29:03.685
Close, but no cigar.

29:30.670 --> 29:35.675
<i>Another beautiful day in paradise.</i>
<i>But don't forget to buckle up.</i>

29:58.364 --> 30:05.204
<i>He's heading west on Stuart.</i>
<i>Stand by, all extras.</i>

30:05.413 --> 30:09.000
<i>He's turning onto Lancaster Square.</i>

30:12.503 --> 30:16.924
<i>My God, he nearly hit her! Something</i>
<i>is wrong. Change frequencies.</i>

30:21.220 --> 30:27.977
<i>Sorry about that, folks. I guess</i>
<i>we picked up a police frequency.</i>

30:28.186 --> 30:34.025
<i>It's classical Klyne, and we've</i>
<i>still got some great music ahead.</i>

30:34.233 --> 30:39.489
<i>But buckle up. Remember safety.</i>
<i>A good driver is a safe driver.</i>

30:42.033 --> 30:45.286
CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS
City Fathers: "Enough is Enough"

33:43.756 --> 33:48.052
- Can I help?
- I have an appointment.

33:54.017 --> 33:57.020
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

33:57.228 --> 34:01.149
- Just tell me what's happening.
- We're remodelling.

34:01.357 --> 34:05.111
- It's none of your business.
- Tell me, or I'll report you!

34:05.320 --> 34:08.114
You're trespassing.

34:38.937 --> 34:42.607
- Marlon!
- Truman, what are you doing here?

34:42.815 --> 34:48.112
I've got to talk to you.
I'm on to something big!

34:48.321 --> 34:52.199
- You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

34:52.408 --> 34:56.996
A lot of strange things
have been happening.

35:00.500 --> 35:06.005
The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it...

35:06.214 --> 35:12.095
And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything I'm doing.

35:12.303 --> 35:17.016
- This is one of your fantasies.
- I think this is about my dad.

35:17.225 --> 35:22.897
I think he's alive. I'll tell you
about it later. I'm being followed.

35:23.106 --> 35:25.984
Who?

35:26.192 --> 35:30.071
It's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

35:33.574 --> 35:37.328
- How about those two?
- Could be.

35:37.537 --> 35:43.084
It's when I'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't...

35:43.293 --> 35:47.171
Anything happen...?
We have to get out of here.

35:47.380 --> 35:50.508
- You ready to go?
- I can't.

35:55.513 --> 36:00.518
- You're gonna get us both fired.
- Okay then, let's do it.

36:00.727 --> 36:06.524
Whatever you say, I'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

36:10.820 --> 36:13.990
Maybe I'm being set up
for something.

36:14.198 --> 36:18.828
You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

36:19.037 --> 36:21.539
No.

36:22.332 --> 36:27.670
When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

36:27.879 --> 36:32.425
I went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

36:32.634 --> 36:36.471
Look at that sunset. It's perfect.

36:36.679 --> 36:42.936
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

36:48.149 --> 36:51.778
Just between you and me, Marlon...

36:51.986 --> 36:56.866
- I'm going away for a while.
- Really?

37:07.794 --> 37:12.966
My little clown...
Old carrot-top.

37:14.425 --> 37:18.388
The best photos...

37:18.596 --> 37:23.226
- We should be getting you home.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

37:23.434 --> 37:29.899
Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

37:30.108 --> 37:34.821
- It looks so small.
- Things do, when you look back.

37:35.029 --> 37:39.534
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

37:39.742 --> 37:44.622
- Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne...
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

37:44.831 --> 37:48.751
Well, she still does.

37:48.960 --> 37:55.550
There's room for baby photos. I want
to hold a grandchild before I go.

37:55.758 --> 37:59.971
We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

38:00.179 --> 38:05.852
- Your favourite show is coming on.
- And we have something to discuss.

38:06.060 --> 38:10.690
- A certain person's birthday.
- Oh, I see.

38:10.898 --> 38:17.530
<i>There'll be another "Lucy" tomorrow.</i>
<i>Now it's time for Golden Oldies.</i>

38:17.739 --> 38:22.619
<i>Tonight we present the classic:</i>
<i>"Show Me the Way to Go Home".</i>

38:22.827 --> 38:28.458
<i>You don't have to leave home to</i>
<i>discover what the world is about.</i>

38:28.666 --> 38:32.629
<i>We learn that no one is poor</i>
<i>who has friends.</i>

38:32.837 --> 38:40.053
<i>Full of laughter, love, pain,</i>
<i>sadness, but ultimately, redemption.</i>

38:40.261 --> 38:47.352
<i>The cherry scene will have you</i>
<i>splitting your sides with laughter.</i>

38:47.560 --> 38:52.357
<i>There'll be tears, too, when</i>
<i>David and Jennifer are reunited.</i>

38:52.565 --> 38:56.736
<i>Let'sjoin the Abbotts</i>
<i>in Camden Village.</i>

39:23.846 --> 39:26.432
Thank you, Sweetie.

39:29.352 --> 39:33.398
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

39:33.606 --> 39:38.736
- I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

39:38.945 --> 39:43.533
There was that elevator disaster.
It was on the news.

39:43.741 --> 39:49.372
The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

39:49.580 --> 39:55.169
Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

39:55.378 --> 40:00.633
Anyway, I have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

40:00.842 --> 40:05.179
She's very young. It's sad.
Wish me luck.

40:05.388 --> 40:09.517
I'll cross my fingers for you.

40:50.266 --> 40:53.561
Excuse me. May I help you?

40:53.770 --> 40:58.191
I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

40:58.399 --> 41:01.861
That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

41:02.070 --> 41:08.076
Sure... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

41:08.284 --> 41:11.955
I had to go to Fiji.
I'll call when I get there.

41:12.163 --> 41:15.500
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

41:15.708 --> 41:19.087
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

41:45.863 --> 41:48.283
Sorry.

41:49.284 --> 41:52.161
Let me help you with that.

41:56.082 --> 41:58.918
He's here.

42:01.629 --> 42:03.923
Scalpel.

42:09.637 --> 42:13.766
I'm now making
my primary incision, -

42:13.975 --> 42:17.562
- just above the right knee.

42:21.774 --> 42:25.737
- Nicely done.
- Unless you're family...

42:25.945 --> 42:32.619
- It's just a beautiful job.
- I'll let someone else tidy up.

42:35.413 --> 42:38.207
TRAVELLERS BEWARE

42:49.010 --> 42:53.222
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!

42:58.436 --> 43:03.232
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

43:03.441 --> 43:08.613
- How can I help?
- I'd like a flight to Fiji.

43:08.821 --> 43:12.951
- When would you like to leave?
- Today.

43:30.927 --> 43:35.640
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

43:35.848 --> 43:39.686
It's the busy season.

43:39.894 --> 43:42.981
Do you want to book the flight?

43:43.189 --> 43:46.442
I'll make other arrangements.

43:49.612 --> 43:54.701
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

44:00.540 --> 44:02.625
Thank you.

44:05.044 --> 44:08.548
Windy City, here we come.

44:08.756 --> 44:11.259
Hi!

44:13.553 --> 44:17.098
Hello...

44:17.307 --> 44:22.520
- Mom, isn't that you know you?
- Face the front.

44:49.631 --> 44:52.884
Everybody off, we've got a problem.

45:11.736 --> 45:14.989
I'm sorry, son.

45:27.126 --> 45:33.341
- Wasn't his father from Chicago?
- His father was from Des Moines.

45:33.549 --> 45:39.847
- Why does he want to go to Chicago?
- He's not going anywhere.

45:56.906 --> 45:59.909
Truman?

46:03.288 --> 46:06.416
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

46:10.378 --> 46:13.715
- Truman...
- Look.

46:19.929 --> 46:26.352
I predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

46:26.561 --> 46:32.108
- followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

46:32.317 --> 46:35.486
- Truman, please...
- Look!

46:40.533 --> 46:42.910
Lady...

46:43.119 --> 46:45.371
Flowers...

46:45.580 --> 46:47.874
- And...?
- And...

46:50.293 --> 46:55.632
- Truman, this is silly.
- There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

47:02.931 --> 47:07.143
You know how I did that?
They're on a loop.

47:07.352 --> 47:12.899
They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

47:13.107 --> 47:17.612
- I invited Marlon to barbecue...
- I won't be here.

47:17.820 --> 47:20.406
We need more charcoal.

47:20.615 --> 47:25.244
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

47:25.453 --> 47:29.207
You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

47:30.375 --> 47:33.086
Okay, go.

47:35.088 --> 47:39.634
I think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

47:39.842 --> 47:42.553
I'm going to take a shower.

47:46.557 --> 47:49.686
Let's go now.
I'm ready. Why wait?

47:49.894 --> 47:54.691
Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

47:54.899 --> 47:58.653
Truman, what are you doing?

48:02.240 --> 48:07.453
- Truman...
- Where shall we go?

48:08.788 --> 48:13.459
- Truman, where are we going?
- I guess I'm being spontaneous.

48:13.668 --> 48:18.172
Somebody help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

48:18.381 --> 48:23.344
Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

48:24.596 --> 48:29.183
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

48:29.392 --> 48:33.563
That's right, I do.
But I never have.

48:33.771 --> 48:36.816
And that's why people go places.

48:37.025 --> 48:41.070
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

48:49.579 --> 48:54.542
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronised, don't you think?

48:54.751 --> 48:59.047
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

49:04.719 --> 49:08.723
Truman, let's go home.

49:08.932 --> 49:12.518
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

49:12.727 --> 49:17.565
It'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

49:17.774 --> 49:21.903
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

49:23.863 --> 49:28.326
- Can you please slow down?
- Yes, I can.

49:30.453 --> 49:33.665
- That's our turn-off.
- I changed my mind.

49:33.873 --> 49:38.211
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

49:43.549 --> 49:49.472
Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
It's magic.

49:49.681 --> 49:54.769
Let me out. If you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

49:54.978 --> 49:59.023
I think I'd like a little company.

50:03.778 --> 50:08.574
Oh, Truman...
You knew this would happen.

50:08.783 --> 50:12.078
You know you can't drive over water.

50:12.287 --> 50:16.332
Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

50:17.458 --> 50:20.920
Give me your hand...
You drive!

50:22.255 --> 50:26.926
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're breaking the law!

50:27.135 --> 50:31.681
- Oh, my!
- You can do it! You can make it!

50:33.224 --> 50:37.186
We're over! We're over the bridge!

50:37.395 --> 50:41.232
- We're over the bridge!
- We're over!

50:44.694 --> 50:46.821
FOREST FIRE WARNING
EXTREME DANGER

50:47.030 --> 50:50.867
- What about that sign?
- They exaggerate. We'll be fine.

50:52.744 --> 50:55.622
Do you believe that?

50:57.957 --> 51:01.085
Truman, we're on fire!

51:01.294 --> 51:04.797
- It's just smoke. You okay?
- Yes.

51:05.006 --> 51:08.092
- Wanna do it again?
- No!

51:08.301 --> 51:10.929
Truman, stop!

51:13.890 --> 51:17.894
What do we do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

51:18.102 --> 51:21.147
I have my Seahaven bank card.

51:21.356 --> 51:25.568
So we're just going to
eat into our savings, is that it?

51:25.777 --> 51:31.115
I'll have to call your mother.
I don't know how she'll take this.

51:43.711 --> 51:45.672
What now?

51:45.880 --> 51:48.383
SEAHAVEN
NUCLEAR POWER STATION

51:51.803 --> 51:55.265
- Looks like a leak at the plant.
- Back up.

51:55.473 --> 52:02.188
Leak at the plant.
The whole area is being evacuated.

52:02.397 --> 52:06.526
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Truman.

52:06.734 --> 52:08.569
Truman...

52:11.155 --> 52:14.409
Truman, come back!

52:17.370 --> 52:19.831
Stop him!

52:20.123 --> 52:22.417
Truman!

52:40.393 --> 52:42.562
Stay away!

52:58.077 --> 53:03.750
- Thank you both for your help.
- Next time he'll be charged.

53:03.958 --> 53:08.713
I understand.
Thanks again. Good night.

53:26.689 --> 53:31.444
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're not well.

53:33.947 --> 53:39.118
Why do you want to have a baby
with me? You can't stand me.

53:39.327 --> 53:42.372
That's not true.

53:46.209 --> 53:51.965
I'll fix you some Mococoa. Natural
cocoa beans from Mt. Nicaragua.

53:52.173 --> 53:58.304
- No artificial sweeteners.
- What are you talking about?

53:58.513 --> 54:02.141
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

54:02.350 --> 54:06.646
What the hell does this
have to do with anything?

54:06.854 --> 54:11.609
- Tell me what's happening!
- You're having a nervous breakdown.

54:11.818 --> 54:14.696
You're part of this, aren't you?

54:16.990 --> 54:21.786
Truman, you are scaring me.

54:21.995 --> 54:25.790
No, <i>you're</i> scaring <i>me</i>.
What are you gonna do?

54:25.999 --> 54:30.461
Dice me, slice me or peel me?
There's so many choices.

54:32.255 --> 54:35.300
Do something!

54:35.508 --> 54:39.304
What? What did you say?

54:39.512 --> 54:43.266
- Who are you talking to?
- I didn't say anything.

54:43.474 --> 54:48.521
- I wasn't talking to anybody.
- Talk to me!

54:48.730 --> 54:53.484
- I don't know anything!
- Stay where you are.

54:53.693 --> 54:55.737
Truman...?

54:58.906 --> 55:01.618
Thank God!

55:05.455 --> 55:10.543
How can anyone expect me to
carry on under these conditions?

55:10.752 --> 55:13.546
It's unprofessional!

55:17.425 --> 55:21.429
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

55:25.642 --> 55:29.812
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

55:31.773 --> 55:35.818
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

55:38.071 --> 55:42.992
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me.

55:43.201 --> 55:47.497
That's a lot of world for one man.

55:48.748 --> 55:54.796
Is it wishful thinking? Wishing
you'd made more out of yourself?

55:55.004 --> 56:01.803
Who hasn't sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on TV?

56:02.011 --> 56:07.558
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.

56:09.352 --> 56:13.481
I've been your best friend
since we were seven.

56:13.690 --> 56:19.028
We got through school by cheating
off each other's test papers.

56:19.237 --> 56:23.116
Jesus, they were identical.

56:23.324 --> 56:26.786
But I always felt safe knowing that.

56:26.995 --> 56:32.000
Because whatever the answer was,
we were right or wrong together.

56:33.626 --> 56:39.424
I stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play North Pole.

56:39.632 --> 56:42.802
And I got pneumonia.

56:43.011 --> 56:45.263
Remember that?

56:45.471 --> 56:48.141
You were out of school for a month.

56:54.230 --> 56:59.652
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

57:03.615 --> 57:10.079
Things haven't worked out for us
like we used to dream they would.

57:11.873 --> 57:16.336
I know what that feeling's like.
Everything slipping away...

57:16.544 --> 57:20.965
You don't want to believe it, so you
look for answers somewhere else.

57:27.805 --> 57:34.270
But the point is, I'd gladly
walk in front of traffic for you.

57:39.233 --> 57:44.113
<i>But the point is, I'd gladly</i>
<i>step in front of traffic for you.</i>

57:44.322 --> 57:47.659
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

57:49.953 --> 57:56.626
And the last thing that
I would ever do... is lie to you.

57:59.921 --> 58:03.091
I mean, think about it.

58:03.299 --> 58:08.763
If everybody is in on it...
I'd have to be in on it, too.

58:17.981 --> 58:22.777
I'm not in on it, Truman,
because there is no "it".

58:26.948 --> 58:31.244
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

58:33.288 --> 58:37.125
The thing that started all this.

58:50.597 --> 58:56.227
I found him for you, Truman.
That's why I came by tonight.

58:56.436 --> 59:00.648
I'm sure he's got
quite a story to tell.

59:03.109 --> 59:05.778
Go to him.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.328
Easy on the fog.

59:14.537 --> 59:18.833
Stand by, crane-cam...
Crane-cam.

59:26.633 --> 59:28.593
Button-cam three.

59:40.897 --> 59:43.816
I never stopped believing.

59:45.860 --> 59:49.155
Go wide. Curb-cam eight.

59:49.364 --> 59:52.075
My son.

59:52.283 --> 59:56.162
- Move in for close-up?
- No, no...

59:57.163 --> 01:00:00.166
Stay back.
Fade up music.

01:00:06.422 --> 01:00:09.968
Now go for the close-up.

01:00:10.176 --> 01:00:14.514
<i>All those years wasted.</i>
<i>I'll make it up to you, son.</i>

01:00:15.515 --> 01:00:17.600
<i>I swear.</i>

01:00:23.106 --> 01:00:25.733
<i>Dad...</i>

01:00:36.327 --> 01:00:38.329
Bravo!

01:00:38.538 --> 01:00:41.541
Congratulations.

01:00:41.749 --> 01:00:46.504
- Okay, quiet down. Concentrate.
- That was great television.

01:00:52.343 --> 01:00:56.472
- Christof, it was brilliant!
- It broke my heart.

01:00:59.309 --> 01:01:02.186
Well done! Congratulations!

01:01:10.361 --> 01:01:13.531
Truman drinks Mococoa,
world's finest cocoa beans -

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.701
- grown on the upper slopes
of Mt. Nicaragua.

01:01:20.288 --> 01:01:24.375
<i>1. 7 billion were there</i>
<i>for his birth.</i>

01:01:27.462 --> 01:01:30.632
<i>220 countries tuned in</i>
<i>for his first step.</i>

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.969
<i>The world stood still</i>
<i>for that stolen kiss.</i>

01:01:35.178 --> 01:01:39.349
<i>And as he grew, so did the</i>
<i>technology. A human life,</i> -

01:01:39.557 --> 01:01:44.604
- <i>recorded on a network of</i>
<i>hidden cameras and broadcast live</i> -

01:01:44.812 --> 01:01:50.193
- <i>24 hours a day, seven days a week,</i>
<i>to an audience around the globe.</i>

01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:56.491
<i>From Seahaven, enclosed in the</i>
<i>largest studio ever constructed,</i> -

01:01:56.699 --> 01:02:02.747
- <i>one of only two man-made</i>
<i>structures visible from space,</i> -

01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:08.378
- <i>now in its 30th great year,</i>
<i>it's The Truman Show!</i>

01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:16.886
<i>What a week! I was on</i>
<i>pins and needles the entire time.</i>

01:02:17.095 --> 01:02:19.931
<i>I'm your host, Mike Michaelson.</i>

01:02:20.139 --> 01:02:23.601
<i>Welcome to Tru-Talk, our forum for</i>
<i>issues growing out of the show.</i>

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:27.272
<i>Tonight, something very special:</i>

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.734
<i>An exclusive interview</i>
<i>with the show's creator.</i>

01:02:31.943 --> 01:02:38.741
<i>Let's go live to the 221st floor</i>
<i>of the Omni-Cam Ecosphere.</i>

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:42.662
<i>There we'll find</i>
<i>the world's greatest tele-visionary.</i>

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:47.917
<i>The designer of the world within</i>
<i>a world that is Seahaven: Christof.</i>

01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:53.172
<i>I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for granting this interview.</i>

01:02:53.381 --> 01:02:58.845
<i>We know your schedule is demanding,</i>
<i>and how you guard your privacy.</i>

01:02:59.053 --> 01:03:03.099
- <i>This, sir, is indeed an honour.</i>
- Don't mention it.

01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:06.728
<i>The catalyst</i>
<i>for the recent dramatic events</i> -

01:03:07.103 --> 01:03:11.858
- <i>has been Truman's father, Kirk,</i>
<i>and his attempt at infiltration.</i>

01:03:12.066 --> 01:03:17.280
<i>This is not the first time someone</i>
<i>has tried to reach Truman, is it?</i>

01:03:17.488 --> 01:03:20.783
<i>We have had our close calls.</i>

01:03:20.992 --> 01:03:27.665
It's television!
I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

01:03:27.874 --> 01:03:35.298
<i>But now, the first intruder</i>
<i>to be a former cast member.</i>

01:03:35.506 --> 01:03:40.637
- <i>A dead one at that.</i>
- <i>Writing Kirk back in, brilliant.</i>

01:03:40.845 --> 01:03:46.559
<i>Kirk started this whole crisis. He</i>
<i>was the only one who could end it.</i>

01:03:46.768 --> 01:03:49.395
Truman, no!

01:03:49.604 --> 01:03:53.274
- That's off limits!
- Why? What's over there?

01:03:53.483 --> 01:03:57.946
Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all.
You have to know your limitations.

01:03:58.154 --> 01:04:02.325
<i>Let's remind viewers why Dad was</i>
<i>written out in the first place.</i>

01:04:02.533 --> 01:04:07.497
<i>As Truman grew up, we manufactured</i>
<i>ways to keep him on the island.</i>

01:04:07.705 --> 01:04:14.504
- I'd like to be a great explorer.
- There's nothing left to explore.

01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:24.973
- <i>Then I thought up Kirk's drowning.</i>
- <i>He's feared the water ever since.</i>

01:04:25.181 --> 01:04:31.854
<i>When Kirk read the synopsis, he was</i>
<i>disappointed, to say the least.</i>

01:04:32.063 --> 01:04:35.316
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>that's why he broke onto the set.</i>

01:04:35.525 --> 01:04:40.071
<i>But how do you intend to explain</i>
<i>his 22-year absence?</i>

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.991
- <i>Amnesia.</i>
- <i>Brilliant.</i>

01:04:43.199 --> 01:04:49.414
<i>Let's take some viewer calls. North</i>
<i>Carolina, you're on with Christof.</i>

01:04:49.622 --> 01:04:54.877
<i>Hi, Christof. I was wondering how</i>
<i>many cameras you got in that town.</i>

01:04:55.086 --> 01:04:59.591
<i>Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.</i>

01:04:59.799 --> 01:05:03.845
<i>Remember, we started with just one.</i>

01:05:04.053 --> 01:05:10.476
<i>He was two weeks premature, as if</i>
<i>he couldn't wait to get started.</i>

01:05:10.685 --> 01:05:15.732
<i>And his eagerness to leave the womb</i>
<i>was the reason he was selected.</i>

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.819
<i>In competition with five other</i>
<i>unwanted pregnancies</i> -

01:05:20.028 --> 01:05:25.742
- <i>for a show determined by an air</i>
<i>date, only Truman arrived on cue.</i>

01:05:28.703 --> 01:05:33.374
<i>I believe Truman is the first child</i>
<i>to be adopted by a corporation.</i>

01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:37.629
- <i>That's correct.</i>
- <i>The show's made enormous revenue.</i>

01:05:37.837 --> 01:05:41.007
<i>Equivalent to the GNP</i>
<i>of a small country.</i>

01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:45.511
<i>It takes the population of an</i>
<i>entire country to keep it running.</i>

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:52.644
<i>Since it's on 24 hours, revenues are</i>
<i>generated by product placement.</i>

01:05:52.852 --> 01:05:57.857
<i>Everything on the show is for sale,</i>
<i>down to the very homes they live in.</i>

01:05:58.066 --> 01:06:02.195
<i>All of it in the Truman catalogue.</i>
<i>Operators are standing by.</i>

01:06:02.403 --> 01:06:07.992
<i>Christof, why has Truman</i>
<i>never come close to discovering</i> -

01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:11.955
- <i>the true nature of his world</i>
<i>until now?</i>

01:06:12.163 --> 01:06:16.167
<i>We accept the reality of the world</i>
<i>with which we're presented.</i>

01:06:17.377 --> 01:06:21.714
<i>The Hague for Christof. Hello.</i>
<i>The Hague...</i>

01:06:23.007 --> 01:06:26.594
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's go to Hollywood, California.</i>

01:06:26.803 --> 01:06:32.642
You're a liar and a manipulator, and
what you've done to Truman is sick.

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:39.148
<i>Well, we remember this voice,</i>
<i>don't we? How could we forget?</i>

01:06:39.357 --> 01:06:43.778
- <i>Let's go to another call.</i>
- <i>No, no. It's fine, Mike.</i>

01:06:43.987 --> 01:06:48.491
<i>I love to reminisce</i>
<i>with former members of the cast.</i>

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:54.706
<i>Sylvia, as you announced so</i>
<i>melodramatically to the world...</i>

01:06:54.914 --> 01:06:59.502
<i>Do you think because you batted</i>
<i>your eyes at Truman once,</i> -

01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:03.965
- <i>flirted with him,</i>
<i>stole a few minutes of air time</i> -

01:07:04.173 --> 01:07:08.469
- <i>to thrust your politics into</i>
<i>the limelight, that you know him?</i>

01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:13.600
<i>That you know what's right for him?</i>
<i>Are you in a position tojudge him?</i>

01:07:13.808 --> 01:07:18.688
What right do you have to
turn a baby's life into a mockery?

01:07:18.896 --> 01:07:22.942
Don't you ever feel guilty?

01:07:23.151 --> 01:07:28.156
<i>I have given Truman</i>
<i>the chance to lead a normal life.</i>

01:07:28.364 --> 01:07:32.327
<i>The world, the place you live in,</i> -

01:07:32.535 --> 01:07:37.957
- <i>is the sick place. Seahaven</i>
<i>is the way the world should be.</i>

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:43.379
- He's a prisoner, not a performer.
- <i>He can leave at any time.</i>

01:07:43.588 --> 01:07:48.718
<i>If his was more than a vague</i>
<i>ambition, if he was determined</i> -

01:07:48.927 --> 01:07:54.891
- <i>to discover the truth, there's</i>
<i>no way we could prevent him.</i>

01:07:55.099 --> 01:07:59.562
<i>I think what distresses you,</i>
<i>really, caller,</i> -

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:05.652
- <i>is that, ultimately, Truman</i>
<i>prefers his cell, as you call it.</i>

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:11.157
That's where you're so wrong.
And he'll prove you wrong.

01:08:11.366 --> 01:08:17.788
<i>These heated comments aside, it's</i>
<i>been a very positive experience.</i>

01:08:17.997 --> 01:08:21.917
<i>For Truman and for the viewers.</i>

01:08:22.126 --> 01:08:28.466
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>
<i>Now that this crisis is behind us,</i> -

01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:32.970
- <i>can we look forward</i>
<i>to some exciting new developments?</i>

01:08:33.179 --> 01:08:38.768
<i>The big news is: Meryl will leave</i>
<i>Truman in an upcoming episode.</i>

01:08:38.977 --> 01:08:42.104
<i>A new romantic interest</i>
<i>will be introduced.</i>

01:08:42.313 --> 01:08:46.859
<i>I'm determined that TV's first</i>
<i>on-air conception will take place.</i>

01:08:47.068 --> 01:08:50.113
<i>Another television milestone.</i>

01:08:50.321 --> 01:08:56.868
<i>It has been a singular honour</i>
<i>and a pleasure. Christof, thank you.</i>

01:10:14.864 --> 01:10:17.367
Hey, Simeon.

01:10:21.037 --> 01:10:26.084
- Is he looking at us?
- You think he knows?

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:29.837
- <i>Hello...</i>
- Better call Christof.

01:10:30.046 --> 01:10:32.966
<i>Come in, Major Burbank.</i>

01:10:49.107 --> 01:10:52.944
He's back to his old self.

01:10:59.993 --> 01:11:03.746
That's an unusual cat, my man.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:11.296
<i>I hereby proclaim this planet...</i>

01:11:14.924 --> 01:11:18.428
<i>... Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.</i>

01:11:20.054 --> 01:11:24.183
- Is he gonna go?
- Hallway camera ready.

01:11:24.392 --> 01:11:30.064
- <i>That one's for free.</i>
- Stand by, all house cameras.

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:34.736
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:11:34.944 --> 01:11:39.824
- In case I don't see you...
...good afternoon and good night.

01:11:41.743 --> 01:11:46.915
Good afternoon, good night...

01:11:47.165 --> 01:11:53.630
- Morning, Truman. How's it going?
- I'll check. Vital signs are good.

01:11:55.673 --> 01:11:58.134
Hey, Pluto!

01:11:58.343 --> 01:12:01.596
- Good morning!
- Look who's here.

01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:06.809
Beautiful day, isn't it? We thought
about the policy, and we'll take it.

01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:11.397
Great! Let's go up to my office
and sign the papers.

01:12:11.606 --> 01:12:16.194
- Next week would be better.
- I knew it. See you guys.

01:12:16.402 --> 01:12:20.239
- See you next week.
- Looking forward to it!

01:12:20.448 --> 01:12:24.702
This isn't about insurance.
This is about the great variable.

01:12:24.911 --> 01:12:30.291
When will death occur?
Could be a week, a month, a year...

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.294
Could be today.

01:12:33.503 --> 01:12:39.509
Innocent sunbather, stabbed by
the tip of a runaway beach umbrella.

01:12:39.717 --> 01:12:42.971
No way to guard against that.

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:48.226
- Excuse me.
- Truman, this is Vivian.

01:12:48.434 --> 01:12:51.938
The two of you
are going to be neighbours.

01:12:54.899 --> 01:13:00.446
I guess what I'm saying
is that life is... fragile.

01:13:02.156 --> 01:13:05.285
- Vivian, your office.
- Sorry.

01:13:05.493 --> 01:13:09.497
I'm sorry... You do?

01:13:09.706 --> 01:13:14.210
Oh, great.
Let me take your information.

01:13:29.475 --> 01:13:32.437
Ready, two. Go to two.

01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:40.612
Back to medium... and wide.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:53.333
I was just trying
to train the kid to... never mind.

01:13:56.544 --> 01:14:01.549
- What's he doing in the basement?
- He moved in there when Meryl left.

01:14:01.758 --> 01:14:06.888
Why wasn't I told? Unpredictable
behaviour has to be reported.

01:14:07.096 --> 01:14:12.018
- He's just sleeping. I thought...
- This is the best shot we've got?

01:14:12.226 --> 01:14:16.064
- What's on the clock-cam?
- Obstruction.

01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:20.944
- What happened?
- He was tidying up his garbage.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:25.365
I was gonna call you,
but he gave up and fell asleep.

01:14:25.573 --> 01:14:30.870
- I want to check the set-ups...
...for the insurance convention.

01:14:31.079 --> 01:14:33.665
Nice move.

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:43.841
There you go.

01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:57.647
Isolate the audio.
Give me a close-up on his torso.

01:15:00.775 --> 01:15:03.486
Still breathing.

01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:09.742
Where's Chloe? Call him.
Tell him it's a wrong number.

01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:17.417
- What took you so long?
- I had to wait for it.

01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:23.715
- They were busy. What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:15:23.923 --> 01:15:28.845
- He did nothing but stand around.
- Shut up and watch.

01:15:29.053 --> 01:15:32.932
Then we went to night vision.
He's asleep.

01:15:34.767 --> 01:15:39.564
There! Stop it.
Zoom in under the chair.

01:15:42.775 --> 01:15:48.531
- Enhance it.
- Is it...? My God...

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:55.788
- He didn't go up the stairs.
- Get Marlon over there!

01:16:11.346 --> 01:16:15.433
Truman... Surprise party!

01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:21.522
I got a six-pack of cold brewskies
with our name on them.

01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:25.276
Come on, pal.
Come on, buddy.

01:16:27.904 --> 01:16:30.198
Shit!

01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:36.037
Marlon, find him.
He's still in the room.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.877
- <i>Come out, wherever you are.</i>
- Good. Keep it light.

01:16:43.086 --> 01:16:45.421
<i>I know you're in here.</i>

01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:55.390
Check under the table.
The closet, behind you.

01:17:01.187 --> 01:17:05.483
Gee, I wonder where
he could possibly be.

01:17:13.408 --> 01:17:15.827
Lawn-cam!

01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:26.838
- Say something. Keep it going.
- <i>He's gone.</i>

01:17:27.046 --> 01:17:30.258
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.891
- God in heaven!
- Give me the phone!

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.568
TECHNICAL FAULT
PLEASE STAND BY

01:18:00.872 --> 01:18:07.170
We've got every available extra
looking for him. The crew, too.

01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:11.132
- What about prop cars?
- Accounted for.

01:18:11.341 --> 01:18:15.678
He has the world's most recognisable
face, he can't disappear.

01:18:55.093 --> 01:18:58.471
Go find him, Pluto. Good dog.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.351
All this fuss!
If he could just hear my voice.

01:19:03.559 --> 01:19:07.772
Truman! Truman!

01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:11.859
Let me try.
Truman!

01:19:12.068 --> 01:19:17.282
It's me, Dad!
Let's talk!

01:19:19.284 --> 01:19:23.705
Yeah, I know. We're just about
done with the square.

01:19:23.913 --> 01:19:28.167
<i>We've got to go back to Barrymore,</i>
<i>check the interiors.</i>

01:19:28.376 --> 01:19:34.507
Who's watching the college?
Send someone over there.

01:19:39.762 --> 01:19:43.933
- Take another man, get down there.
- Find the son of a bitch!

01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:47.812
Get some batteries.
He's not gonna glow in the dark.

01:19:50.773 --> 01:19:55.153
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

01:19:59.574 --> 01:20:04.037
- What time is it?
- It's way too early for that.

01:20:10.043 --> 01:20:13.630
Cue the sun.

01:20:17.842 --> 01:20:20.303
What time is it?

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:26.184
Christof, what's going on?
There's rumours that he's dead.

01:20:26.392 --> 01:20:29.020
The media's having a feeding frenzy.

01:20:29.228 --> 01:20:34.984
Every network has a pirated shot
of Marlon making an ass of himself.

01:20:35.193 --> 01:20:40.615
- The sponsors are threatening us.
- We're getting our highest ratings.

01:20:44.744 --> 01:20:48.998
- <i>No sign of him.</i>
- Go back to town, join the others.

01:20:49.207 --> 01:20:55.296
Everyone else at first positions.
Everyone <i>is</i> at first positions?

01:21:12.814 --> 01:21:16.150
He's got to be there somewhere.

01:21:17.819 --> 01:21:22.365
- We're not watching the sea.
- Why would we watch the sea?

01:21:22.573 --> 01:21:27.579
- Sweep the harbour.
- Bring up the harbour cameras.

01:21:27.787 --> 01:21:32.750
- Aren't some of those out?
- Yeah, but we have the lighthouse.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:36.796
All buoy-cams, please.

01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:41.092
- Long lens, short-base cameras.
- Why are we looking at the water?

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:50.602
Truman, where are you going?

01:21:52.812 --> 01:21:58.484
- Sailing? He's afraid of the water.
- Resume transmission.

01:22:04.198 --> 01:22:07.452
I got 2-1 he doesn't make it.

01:22:11.831 --> 01:22:15.043
Just leave them in the car.

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:30.808
Get off this mast-cam. You can't
see his face. Go to the cabin-cam.

01:22:33.478 --> 01:22:36.898
Perfect.
That's our hero shot.

01:23:03.049 --> 01:23:08.179
- Let's get another boat out there.
- I need to talk to the ferry guys.

01:23:08.388 --> 01:23:11.975
Come on, get it moving!

01:23:14.769 --> 01:23:19.691
- I'm just the bus driver.
- They can't sail. They're actors!

01:23:24.153 --> 01:23:27.073
How do we stop him?

01:23:36.457 --> 01:23:43.715
Okay... We're going to access
the weather programme now.

01:23:43.923 --> 01:23:48.219
So hold on to your hats.
You got that?

01:23:48.428 --> 01:23:52.932
No, I think we'll want to
localise the storm over the boat.

01:23:55.435 --> 01:23:57.854
Get the co-ordinates.

01:23:58.062 --> 01:24:03.818
- There's no rescue boat.
- He'll turn back. He'll be afraid.

01:24:05.778 --> 01:24:07.905
There she blows.

01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:22.128
Come on.

01:24:44.359 --> 01:24:47.028
Give me some lightning.

01:24:47.236 --> 01:24:49.614
Hit him again!

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:08.299
- He can't die on television!
- He was born on television.

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:44.711
Hold on!

01:26:09.944 --> 01:26:13.197
Is that the best you can do?

01:26:13.406 --> 01:26:16.451
You're gonna have to kill me!

01:26:17.619 --> 01:26:20.413
<i>What should we do</i>
<i>with a drunken sailor...</i>

01:26:20.622 --> 01:26:26.794
- I demand you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

01:26:27.003 --> 01:26:29.839
Increase the wind!

01:26:32.842 --> 01:26:37.180
- For the last time...
- Capsize him, tip him over.

01:26:37.388 --> 01:26:41.935
- He's tied himself to the boat!
- He'll drown, and he doesn't care.

01:26:42.143 --> 01:26:44.729
Do it... Do it!

01:27:38.408 --> 01:27:40.827
That's enough.

01:31:52.579 --> 01:31:54.289
I want to talk to him.

01:31:58.167 --> 01:32:00.378
EXIT

01:32:11.973 --> 01:32:16.060
Truman... You can speak.

01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:21.524
<i>I can hear you.</i>

01:32:24.193 --> 01:32:27.989
- Who are you?
- I'm the creator of a TV show.

01:32:28.197 --> 01:32:31.576
It gives hope
and inspiration to millions.

01:32:35.872 --> 01:32:39.667
- <i>Then who am I?</i>
- You're the star.

01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:49.677
- <i>Was nothing real?</i>
- You were real.

01:32:49.886 --> 01:32:54.140
That's what made you so good
to watch. Listen, Truman.

01:32:54.349 --> 01:33:00.313
There's no more truth out there
than in the world I created for you.

01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:07.237
<i>The same lies, the same deceit.</i>

01:33:07.445 --> 01:33:13.576
But in my world,
you have nothing to fear.

01:33:16.412 --> 01:33:21.417
- <i>I know you better than you do.</i>
- You never had a camera in my head.

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:27.340
You're afraid.
That's why you can't leave.

01:33:31.844 --> 01:33:35.682
It's okay, Truman.
I understand.

01:33:37.267 --> 01:33:42.438
I have been watching you
your whole life.

01:33:42.647 --> 01:33:46.609
I was watching when you were born.

01:33:46.818 --> 01:33:50.572
I was watching
when you took your first step.

01:33:54.158 --> 01:33:59.163
<i>I watched you</i>
<i>on your first day of school.</i>

01:33:59.372 --> 01:34:03.793
The episode
when you lost your first tooth.

01:34:06.379 --> 01:34:09.090
You can't leave, Truman.

01:34:09.299 --> 01:34:12.510
- Please, God.
- <i>You belong here.</i>

01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:14.846
You can do it.

01:34:15.805 --> 01:34:17.890
With me.

01:34:19.809 --> 01:34:23.730
Talk to me.
Say something.

01:34:28.067 --> 01:34:34.407
Say something, damn it! You're
on TV. You're live to the world!

01:34:51.299 --> 01:34:56.930
In case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

01:35:35.176 --> 01:35:38.638
He made it!
All right, Truman!

01:35:48.481 --> 01:35:50.566
Cease transmission.

01:35:55.363 --> 01:35:59.534
- You want another slice?
- No. Let's see what else is on.
