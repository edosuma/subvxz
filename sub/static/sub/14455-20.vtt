00:12.200 --> 00:15.300
Narrator: Coming up, what's got
Murr acting shady?

00:17.067 --> 00:19.100
Why is Sal getting up
close and personal?

00:19.100 --> 00:22.467
You can't unsee a family
member's genitals.

00:22.467 --> 00:24.633
And which joker
will be overexposed

00:24.633 --> 00:28.267
in tonight's
impromptu punishment?

00:28.267 --> 00:30.967
Sal: Prepare for
something amazing.

00:30.967 --> 00:32.800
Q:
Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:34.333 --> 00:35.933
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:37.567 --> 00:39.567
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:39.567 --> 00:41.733
Joe: Larry!

00:46.333 --> 00:48.733
Today we're at Food Bazaar
Supermarket asking shoppers

00:48.733 --> 00:51.033
to do us a solid and hold
onto something for us.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.233
Yes, Joseph, but the catch
is the weird item

00:53.233 --> 00:54.333
that we're asking
them to hold

00:54.333 --> 00:56.033
has been given to us
by the other guys.

00:56.033 --> 00:58.167
If you can't get a stranger
to hold onto that item

00:58.167 --> 01:00.367
until you return,
you lose.

01:00.367 --> 01:02.067
Considering what you guys
are gonna have me hold,

01:02.067 --> 01:03.400
can I go first?
-You should go first.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.933
-Here we go.
-There he is.

01:11.667 --> 01:14.600
That's our friend Carissa, who
decided to help us out today.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.200
How come you're
holding the leash,

01:16.200 --> 01:18.833
but she seems like
she's in charge?

01:18.833 --> 01:20.933
I'm in over my head
here, fellas.

01:20.933 --> 01:24.067
Sometimes
we even go too far.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.433
They have the rice pudding.

01:28.567 --> 01:31.133
Do me a favor? I got to run
and get some applesauce.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.067
Can you hold her
for me for one second?

01:33.067 --> 01:35.333
I'll just -- I'll be
right back in a moment.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.967
-He's doing it!
-I can't believe it!

01:36.967 --> 01:39.600
Dude!
Don't let her go, please.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.267
Carissa, can you say,
"Will you please let me go?"

01:44.267 --> 01:46.967
Will you please
let me go?

01:46.967 --> 01:48.967
Please?

01:48.967 --> 01:51.133
-You got to come back.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.700
**

01:52.700 --> 01:54.067
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

01:54.067 --> 01:56.500
Yeah, it would have been
bad if you let her go.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.700
-Wow!
-Good wait.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.800
I can't believe it!

01:59.800 --> 02:02.567
Stay in school.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.267
Here we go.
A jar full of poison.

02:08.267 --> 02:09.933
I need somebody
to hold this.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.567
Sorry. Can you hold this poison
for me real quick?

02:15.233 --> 02:17.967
Just hold it real quick.
Just -- come on, come on.

02:17.967 --> 02:20.067
Just real quick.
Why won't you hold my poison?

02:20.067 --> 02:22.067
Smart. Smart.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.233
Waffles --
I got to grab.

02:24.233 --> 02:25.933
Yeah.

02:25.933 --> 02:28.200
-Nah.
-Smart.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.933
Well, could you hold
this poison real quick?

02:29.933 --> 02:31.267
Okay, that's smart.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.667
Hold this poison
for me real quick?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.067
Smart.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.067
Smart.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.900
Actually, want to do me a solid,
hold that real quick.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.333
I got to run
and get mashed potatoes.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.933
It isn't pee.
It's poison.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.600
Just hold it.
Just...

02:51.067 --> 02:53.467
Sal: You put her in front
of you

02:56.567 --> 02:59.300
You think it's gonna be easy
to get somebody to hold this?

02:59.300 --> 03:02.067
Really?

03:02.067 --> 03:03.433
Oh, my gosh.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.900
"Could you
hold that real quick?"

03:04.900 --> 03:06.267
Do you mind holding it
real quick for me?

03:06.267 --> 03:08.133
I got to get macaroni salad,
be back in one second.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.300
Careful, it's heavy, now.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.333
Two hands
'cause it could tip.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.067
Be back in one sec.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.067
She's getting so annoyed.

03:19.067 --> 03:21.267
You know how heavy
it is to look at?

03:21.267 --> 03:23.300
**

03:23.300 --> 03:24.933
She's reading the circular.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.400
Ask her to move and
get something near her.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.100
Excuse me, miss.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.800
Now she's getting pissed.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.900
Why don't you go check her
circular to see what's on sale.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.133
Let me just see this.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.333
-Look at the annoyance!

03:40.333 --> 03:42.067
-Oh, my God.
-She's so annoyed.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.433
Murray, you're
pushing the envelope

03:43.433 --> 03:45.533
a little too far, buddy.

03:45.533 --> 03:47.100
She's not holding it
anymore!

03:47.100 --> 03:49.633
-Ah! You lose!
-She isn't -- Aaaahhh!

03:49.633 --> 03:51.067
Look at the slick
look on her face.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.267
-Yes!
-Yes.

03:52.267 --> 03:54.833
You're not
holding it anymore.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.067
Joe: Smart.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.833
Sal:
Pair of mousetraps.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.267
Joe: Buddy, here, this is
what we want you to do.

04:04.267 --> 04:06.567
We want you to set
one mouse trap off

04:06.567 --> 04:08.233
before you hand
off the other one.

04:08.233 --> 04:10.300
The one we're handing off
to the person doesn't work.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.667
Right. Of course not.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.733
Let's see if someone
will carry a mouse trap

04:13.733 --> 04:15.967
and potentially
lose their fingers.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.767
Oh, whoa! Ah!
Damn it. Ah!

04:18.767 --> 04:20.933
C-Could you hold that
for one second for me?

04:23.733 --> 04:25.933
No way in hell!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.100
You s

04:28.100 --> 04:29.533
Yeah.

04:31.633 --> 04:32.633
These things hurt.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.467
I-I've broken enough
hands already

04:34.467 --> 04:36.333
to know that these things hurt,
you what I'm saying?

04:36.333 --> 04:38.133
-Oh, okay.
-Do you know where the -- aw!

04:38.133 --> 04:39.433
Oh!

04:39.433 --> 04:41.300
Could you do me a favor
and hold that one second?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.700
Do you know --
do you know if the, uh --

04:46.700 --> 04:48.867
if the bread's
down that way?

04:48.867 --> 04:50.933
-Yeah, it's down that way.
-Ow!

04:50.933 --> 04:52.800
-Oh, my God.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.733
All right, I'm done.
I'm done.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.300
I'm just gonna...

04:56.300 --> 04:58.067
I'm gonna assume
she's not gonna hold it.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.833
I'm gonna get out of here.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.900
Sal:
That was a hard no, buddy.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.533
Narrator: Q, Murr, and Joe
couldn't get a helping hand,

05:06.533 --> 05:09.500
so they're first up
on the loser board.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.233
We're here in the park
where Sal and Murr

05:11.233 --> 05:12.833
are gonna make up
words to strangers.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.433
Joe and I are gonna
give them a made-up word

05:14.433 --> 05:17.433
that they have to come up with a
crazy-sounding explanation for.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.900
If we can't get them
to admit

05:18.900 --> 05:20.800
that they've heard of that word,
we lose.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.733
Bajungle.
You guys heard of it?

05:22.733 --> 05:23.767
No.

05:29.867 --> 05:31.600
It's a hot one today,
right? It's insane.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.800
There you go.
It's hot out.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.433
It's hot, I can't do it.
I can't do it.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.200
-Joe!
-I can't do it. It's hot out.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.200
-I mean, if he's doing it.
-...if you want to.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.967
Maybe dip in the water
out today.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.133
95 degrees, I'd do it.

05:44.133 --> 05:46.633
I feel like I've wandered
into the wrong set.

05:46.633 --> 05:50.167
Okay, Sal. Your word...
"vambommled."

05:50.167 --> 05:52.733
I could probably take
the train by Coney Island.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.300
I was supposed to go
with my roommate,

05:54.300 --> 05:55.667
but everything got
vambommled.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.600
Vambommled?

05:59.300 --> 06:01.933
It's, uh, when you,
uh...

06:01.933 --> 06:04.867
when you can't unsee
a family member's genitals.

06:04.867 --> 06:07.067
-Oh, okay.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.067
You ever see
a family member's...

06:10.567 --> 06:12.667
You ever see a family
member's genitalia?

06:12.667 --> 06:13.867
One time. Yeah.

06:13.867 --> 06:16.067
You can't unsee that.
So, what do you call it?

06:16.067 --> 06:19.067
You know what, I unsaw it.
I blocked it out.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.800
Sal, I'm getting pretty close
to being vambuzzled back here.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.500
-Look at this.
-No.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.233
So you sure you
never heard of it?

06:27.233 --> 06:28.267
Positive.

06:28.267 --> 06:29.767
-Ohhh!
-Oh!

06:29.767 --> 06:31.667
-Nice try, buddy.
-No success.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.467
Here we go, here we go.

06:35.467 --> 06:38.133
Are you serious? She's telling
me my lip is sweating.

06:38.133 --> 06:39.767
You think I give
a flying

06:39.767 --> 06:41.600
what is happening
with me right now?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.333
-She's like, "Your l--
-Oh, hold on, yeah.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.167
Go ahead.
Let's make Joe..."

06:47.900 --> 06:50.067
Look at me!
I'm a monster!

06:50.067 --> 06:52.200
-Well...

06:55.800 --> 06:58.600
She's like, "Joe, your naked
titties are sweaty."

06:58.600 --> 07:01.067
Oh, you want me to blot?
Hold on.

07:01.067 --> 07:03.433
How are you doing in black pants
and a long

07:03.433 --> 07:05.133
It's all I got, so.

07:05.133 --> 07:09.533
The word is...
"ponktacology."

07:09.533 --> 07:12.667
Yeah. I'm doing some work
with ponktacology.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.767
Wow.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.700
Ponktacology is the, um...

07:17.933 --> 07:21.933
It's the science of getting a
toddler just a little bit drunk.

07:23.467 --> 07:25.067
It has amazing
medical benefits.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.167
-Yeah, I -- no, yeah --
-You know how back in the day --

07:30.333 --> 07:33.333
The health benefits outweigh
the inebriation factor.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.300
It really does.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.733
They're, you know,
doing like a .7, .8

07:37.733 --> 07:38.900
on a Breathalyzer.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.500
.7, you're dead,
though, aren't you?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.367
An elephant would be dead,
never mind a toddler.

07:43.367 --> 07:46.467
You've never heard of
the word "ponktacology?"

07:46.467 --> 07:48.100
Yeah!
You've never heard of it?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.800
I have sent --

07:49.800 --> 07:51.067
No?

07:51.067 --> 07:53.533
-He's out.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.567
Narrator: Both guys lost
this war of words,

07:55.567 --> 07:59.167
which means Murr is in the lead
on the loser board.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.467
Today, we're here at
Cliffside Park Senior Center

08:01.467 --> 08:03.400
showing senior citizens
how to use technology.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.267
While teaching the class,
we're gonna have to do

08:05.267 --> 08:06.900
and say whatever
the other guys tell us to.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.300
If you refuse to do
or say anything, you lose.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.467
You know,
when I was your age,

08:10.467 --> 08:12.567
I used technology
uphill both ways.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.500
Aw, there he goes.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.767
Okay, side note --
we have figured out

08:16.767 --> 08:19.733
that if none of us say "no"
in this challenge,

08:19.733 --> 08:22.300
that Murray loses
the episode mathematically.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.633
So we're making a pact

08:23.633 --> 08:25.500
that we're not gonna say
"no" to anything

08:25.500 --> 08:26.900
to force
Murray to lose.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.133
-This is a strong alliance.
-Can't say "no" to anything.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.933
Does that mean that we are
gonna go easy on each other?

08:30.933 --> 08:32.233
-Absolutely not.
-No, definitely not.

08:32.233 --> 08:33.567
-What, why wouldn't --
-Play to win.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.767
Okay, got it. Got it.

08:34.767 --> 08:39.667
Oh, hello, guys.
How are you?

08:41.533 --> 08:42.900
-I'm Lenny.
-Joe.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.133
Barbara.
Introduce yourself
as Major Tech Dude.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.400
Major Tech Dude is
what my friends call me.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.067
Is that your title
or is that your name?

08:48.067 --> 08:50.500
"Major" is my title.
Major Tech Dude.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.533
Sal, there's an extra chair.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.067
Why don't you get rid
of it by throwing it.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.300
All right, only
three of us here.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.133
So we don't need
the extra chair, then.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.967
-So rude.

09:02.967 --> 09:04.967
All right, guys.
So what we're gonna do

09:04.967 --> 09:06.933
just a little tech review
of a tablet.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.067
Take a picture
of you three.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.833
So to take a picture,
touch the camera.

09:09.833 --> 09:13.800
It opens right up. All right,
so one, two, and three.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.900
Now say, "Barbara,
you blinked in that photo,

09:15.900 --> 09:17.600
but Lenny, you're my favorite.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.267
I wish I had some treats
to give you."

09:19.267 --> 09:21.300
Aw, you blinked Barbara,
you ruined the whole thing.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.533
I'm sorry.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.633
Lenny, you didn't blink.
You're one of my favorites.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.533
I wish I had a treat
to give you.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.900
Okay.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.833
So weird.

09:31.833 --> 09:33.267
Sal, clear your throat.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.967
Q: "I'm sorry
if I'm a bit hoarse."

09:35.967 --> 09:37.567
Sorry
if I'm a bit hoarse.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.433
"A man had his hand
on my throat last night."

09:39.433 --> 09:42.133
A ma-- uh...

09:42.133 --> 09:44.367
Sorry if I'm a bit hoarse.
-You said that.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.433
-Yeah, sorry.
-Yeah, 'cause he's stalling.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.600
No, I'm -- mm...
Sor-- oh...

09:48.600 --> 09:50.200
"A man had his hand
on my throat last night."

09:50.200 --> 09:53.267
A m-- A man had his hand
on my throat last night.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.533
Um, let's move along.

09:58.533 --> 10:01.733
-You could set an alarm -- no.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.200
-Yeah. Yeah, it is.
-Yeah it is.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.567
-Just one second.
-Turn around and say,

10:04.567 --> 10:06.633
"Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'm teaching these blueheads."

10:06.633 --> 10:08.033
No, mm...

10:08.033 --> 10:09.533
-Ooh!

10:09.533 --> 10:11.267
Remember the pact,
buddy.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.333
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'm teaching these blueheads.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.767
Oh, my God!
I can't believe he said it!

10:17.767 --> 10:19.667
So let's get right back
into it.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.633
Uh...

10:22.633 --> 10:23.967
I got another
surprise for Sal.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.300
-Yeah.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.133
The top left button here,
it then sends out a signal...

10:28.133 --> 10:30.767
What the...
Oh, there's my technology...

10:30.767 --> 10:32.333
This is my Segway.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.667
So basically what you do
is you click the top left

10:34.667 --> 10:36.800
and it goes looking
for --

10:36.800 --> 10:38.433
Sorry.

10:38.433 --> 10:40.000
So anyway...

10:40.000 --> 10:42.133
-Look at the Segway!
-It's gonna go into --

10:42.133 --> 10:45.067
It's gonna find any signals
that are in here.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.400
The United States
has its own websites

10:49.400 --> 10:51.867
and every other country
has their own websites.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.567
So China has their own,
Russia has their own,

10:54.567 --> 10:56.400
South America
has their own.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.600
So you want to stay
on dot-com.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.100
Those are the Web-address
standard dot-com...

11:02.700 --> 11:04.400
What w--

11:04.400 --> 11:06.733
"Uh, just stay away
from Puerto Rican websites."

11:06.733 --> 11:08.167
My last bit of advice
for you guys,

11:08.167 --> 11:09.433
and I'll leave you
with this --

11:09.433 --> 11:12.100
just stay away from
Puerto Rican websites.

11:14.833 --> 11:17.433
So, we're just gonna show
a little bit of technology here.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.267
Joe, stay strong.
Remember the pact.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.567
Got it, buddy.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.233
What is going on, man?

11:24.233 --> 11:25.333
All right, well...

11:25.333 --> 11:27.067
"All right, hopefully
this things works.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.400
My dog pissed on it
last night."

11:28.400 --> 11:30.967
Yeah, hopefully this thing --
this thing will work fine.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.167
My dog pissed on it
last night.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.533
-Yeah.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.667
Hosed it down, front to back,
but it's got the cover.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.867
It's one of those, so.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.333
"Whose a bitch got
to kiss around here

11:38.333 --> 11:39.767
to get a cream soda?"

11:41.433 --> 11:44.567
Whose a bitch got to kiss
around here to get a cream soda?

11:46.933 --> 11:48.500
...got to kiss.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.667
So step one,
here, let's go...

11:49.667 --> 11:52.200
"Now, has anybody been
on the Internet before?"

11:52.200 --> 11:54.233
So you guys know
what the Internet is?

11:54.233 --> 11:56.300
"Oh, you know the Internet?
Treats for everyone!"

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
Great. Okay, so then
it's treats for everybody.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.267
They're in the cabinet
right by your side.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.100
Yeah, you guys got --
we got these here for people

12:02.100 --> 12:05.100
that knew what the Internet was.
-Yep. Just drag it out, buddy.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.133
Here's a bag of some
ramen noodles for you guys.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.600
Here you go,
that's a ramen noodle.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.933
You can take that
home with you.

12:11.933 --> 12:13.900
"You guys remember this
from the Depression, right?"

12:16.167 --> 12:17.600
Okay, you guys
remember the ramen.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.367
Right? That's from --
from the -- yeah...

12:20.367 --> 12:21.700
Yeah.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.900
The, uh, the uh...

12:22.900 --> 12:24.133
Let's see,
when was that big?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.300
The Depression,
people had that a lot.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.067
The Dust Bowl, you know.
You guys remember that.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.067
Oh, wait a minute.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.600
I can't believe
he said it.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.100
You could --
If you want to, uh...

12:34.100 --> 12:36.700
Joe, are they talking about you
when you're not looking?

12:36.700 --> 12:38.900
If you went to
a suggested, uh...

12:38.900 --> 12:42.533
So let's see if we have...
You guys talking about me?

12:42.533 --> 12:43.700
What?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.067
Yes, we were.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.600
'Cause I'm looking --
my focus is down here.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.267
I didn't know --
hold on.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.167
That's a lot of sodium --
910 milligrams.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.833
Yeah, that's right.
They're delicious,

12:52.833 --> 12:54.700
but they're not healthy.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.267
Maybe one soup
for two or three.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.400
A lot of water.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.867
I'm sitting right here.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.400
Okay, let me see
if I have...

13:03.400 --> 13:06.333
Joe, under the table,
just pull out the computer.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.633
This is a computer.
-Oh. Oh, my God.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.333
This is older than me,
for Christ's sake.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.133
Oh, let's not get
carried away.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.800
The big difference here
is first and foremost

13:14.800 --> 13:16.167
is a physical keyboard.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.967
You know what I mean?
So the keyboard -- these two...

13:17.967 --> 13:19.633
Do you see smoke
coming out of...

13:19.633 --> 13:20.900
Oh, my God.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.800
I see the smoke.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.967
Aw, all right, well...

13:23.967 --> 13:25.367
Murr: Look at the smoke
coming out of it.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.800
No, no,
the problem's my --

13:26.800 --> 13:29.233
the problem is my God
dog pisses on everything.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.867
Oh, don't blame him.

13:32.700 --> 13:36.200
It pisses on everything.
It was Cannoli, I bet.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.367
This used to be convenient,

13:37.367 --> 13:38.767
but now who wants to
walk around with this?

13:38.767 --> 13:40.067
You're killing me
with the smoke.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.433
I'm sorry.
We'll get rid of it.

13:41.433 --> 13:44.067
These fumes are fine.
They're just melting plastic.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.867
Probably toxic.
You guys should be fine.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.767
We're concentrating
on tablets.

13:50.767 --> 13:51.967
You guys
have one of these?

13:51.967 --> 13:54.300
-No, I don't. No.
"

13:54.300 --> 13:56.167
Should I speak
in Spanish or?

13:56.167 --> 13:57.533
-I'm not Spanish.
-English. No.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.900
"This isn't the señors' class?
Oh, this is for seniors."

13:59.900 --> 14:02.900
Oh, this is --
this is for seniors.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.667
I thought
this was for señors.

14:07.067 --> 14:10.467
"None of that
Spanish bull."

14:10.467 --> 14:12.367
None...

14:12.367 --> 14:14.767
None of that Spanish bull
, you know what I mean.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.667
All right, here we go.
-They're laughing.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.600
Oh, look at them
looking around!

14:20.667 --> 14:22.533
Could you slide
in just a little bit?

14:22.533 --> 14:24.133
I want to get
a picture of you guys.

14:24.133 --> 14:25.767
There you go,
look at that. Boom.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.133
"Now, I'm gonna send
this picture

14:27.133 --> 14:28.600
we just took of you guys."

14:28.600 --> 14:30.533
I'm gonna send this picture
that we just took with you guys.

14:30.533 --> 14:31.867
"So here's the address --

14:31.867 --> 14:35.600
identityfraud..."

14:35.600 --> 14:38.367
Identityfraud...

14:38.367 --> 14:40.067
"...@gotchasuckers.com."

14:40.067 --> 14:41.133
Gotcha suckers.

14:41.133 --> 14:45.833
Gotcha...suckers.com.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.100
Sent.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.267
-All right.
-"You can gamble online."

14:51.267 --> 14:52.633
You can also
gamble online.

14:52.633 --> 14:55.200
"So now you guys don't have
to clog up the casinos."

14:56.367 --> 14:59.600
-W-- Aww, that is...
-The pact!

14:59.600 --> 15:01.367
Like, New Jersey
has made it

15:01.367 --> 15:02.833
that you can actually
gamble online

15:02.833 --> 15:05.467
so you guys don't have
to clog up the casinos.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.533
"I mean, can a guy play
a  penny slot?"

15:12.567 --> 15:14.567
I mean, can a guy play
a  penny slot,

15:14.567 --> 15:16.500
you know what I'm saying?

15:17.900 --> 15:19.500
Whew!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.600
It's a good fan for
when it gets hot in here.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.933
Q, dial in this number
to the top box there.

15:23.933 --> 15:26.067
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna show
you how to use FaceTime.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.567
Here we go.
So, yeah, you'll see.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.800
So now I'm calling
my buddy on video phone.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.067
And, like, we'll be able
to see each other.

15:32.067 --> 15:35.067
Dude, I was waiting all day.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.233
I'm in the parking lot, man.
With everything you said.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.600
I'm here, I'm doing
the thing, I'm ready.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.900
I'll be out in a minute.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.167
I'm doing the class
for the señors.

15:49.167 --> 15:52.333
I know, but I'm ready. It's not
gonna last much longer.

15:52.333 --> 15:55.133
It gets dry very quick.
I need you to come out.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.667
You're breaking up.
You're breaking up, pal.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.067
You're breaking up.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.100
You're breaking up.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.933
"We're all wrapped up. I got
to get back to the institution."

16:06.933 --> 16:09.467
We're all wrapped up here. I got
to get back to the institution.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.667
A  nut job.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.500
-Hey!
-Hey!

16:18.500 --> 16:19.933
One more pact!

16:19.933 --> 16:21.700
That's what
I call an alliance, boys.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.433
All right, so, with that,
we have tonight's big loser,

16:24.433 --> 16:26.167
and his name is Murr.

16:26.167 --> 16:29.167
Narrator:
Murr doesn't know it yet,
but he's about to get punished.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.267
All right, Murr.
Let's teach this class.

16:33.267 --> 16:36.067
**

16:39.400 --> 16:41.633
Your dad's a senior!

16:41.633 --> 16:44.733
-Hi, Dad.
-So welcome to your father.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.867
Have a seat, your ass
is about to get punished.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.133
Oh, wha

16:48.133 --> 16:50.633
You lost the episode, buddy.
'Cause none of us said "no."

16:50.633 --> 16:52.967
That was the pact.
-Uh...

16:52.967 --> 16:55.667
I'm sorry for --
for this.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.167
This is Brian's hair.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.733
Murray's dad has always
been cooler than Murr.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.267
Every time Murray would throw
those barbecues at his house,

17:08.267 --> 17:09.733
we would always
end up hanging out

17:09.733 --> 17:12.067
with his dad
by the pool, drinking.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.233
Joe: "So, Dad, I'm supposed to
teach you about an iPad..."

17:14.233 --> 17:16.900
So, Dad, I'm supposed to teach
you about how to use an iPad...

17:16.900 --> 17:19.067
"...but instead we're gonna
teach you how to use an iPhone.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.100
My iPhone."

17:23.433 --> 17:25.633
I'm gonna teach you
how to use my iPhone.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.267
"So let me just hook it up
to the screen here,

17:27.267 --> 17:29.100
so everybody can see it."

17:31.933 --> 17:35.067
All right, there it is.

17:35.067 --> 17:37.133
Murr, just randomly scroll
through the photos.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.500
Oh, God.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.533
Uh, I'll take you through
some of the photos on my phone.

17:42.533 --> 17:47.100
Let me see. Ah, there's you
and I and Mom, right?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.500
The other day.
-Oh, I remember that.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.433
Hey, there's me as a kid.

17:55.633 --> 17:58.200
-Stop pulling up normal photos.
-Yeah, Murr, get in there.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.400
Stop right there.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.467
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.067
-"Dad..."
-Dad...

18:05.067 --> 18:07.633
"...did you ever imagine
you would have a 40-year-old son

18:07.633 --> 18:09.400
who slept with a blankie?"

18:09.400 --> 18:10.933
...did you ever imagine
that you would have

18:10.933 --> 18:14.533
a 40-year-old son
who sleeps with a blankie?

18:18.667 --> 18:20.667
Can we just go through
this photo right now?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.300
He's sitting alone at home.

18:22.300 --> 18:27.067
He then coyly holds
a tattered blankie to his lips,

18:27.067 --> 18:29.900
peers through it
at the camera.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.700
A 40-year-old man.
-Stop right there!

18:31.700 --> 18:33.200
What's that?
Stop right there.

18:35.967 --> 18:39.067
That's me playing video games
last night in my bath towel.

18:39.067 --> 18:42.567
He was playing naked
virtual reality.

18:42.567 --> 18:45.567
-He's looking at this son...
-He's looking so slighted!

18:47.200 --> 18:49.400
You know, friends.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.900
I like
that you have company

18:50.900 --> 18:53.067
and you just zone them out
with virtual reality.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.600
Mm-hmm.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.067
Joe: Stop right there.
Stop right there.

18:57.067 --> 19:01.067
Can I ask you
what is going on?

19:01.067 --> 19:04.867
The confusion your father is
experiencing -- and the regret!

19:04.867 --> 19:06.800
Why does he have
this stuff on his phone?

19:08.900 --> 19:11.200
Let's move on to, like, getting
in contact with people, right?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.667
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Oh, Murr...

19:14.667 --> 19:16.133
Can you specifically
call someone

19:16.133 --> 19:18.933
that you might have met
in a club for adults?

19:21.367 --> 19:22.833
Ah, let's see. Yeah.
Yeah.

19:47.733 --> 19:50.333
He's like to meet you
again!

19:52.067 --> 19:53.567
Oh, my God.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.033
Yeah! Yeah!

20:01.033 --> 20:02.800
Got him!

20:02.800 --> 20:04.933
-Oh, that was great.
-Okay, we got to stop.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.733
At this point, it's a
punishment for Mr. Murray.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.667
Look how miserable he is.
We're done, Murr. That's it.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.900
We're over.
Well done, Murr.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.833
Congratulations, buddy,
you suffered enough.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.333
You got through it.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.300
Okay, welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:19.300 --> 20:22.567
Murr just got punished
with some help from your father.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.067
Yes.
And you're about to see
a behind-the-scenes look

20:25.067 --> 20:27.233
AT how it happened in bonus
footage from tonight's episode.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.733
But I got to ask you,
before we cut anywhere else,

20:29.733 --> 20:33.800
how do you feel right now?
-I got to call Jessica.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.667
This is Murray's dad.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.767
Murray's dad has always
been cooler than Murray.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.333
-Always.
-Always.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.333
What we're saying is Murray
takes after his mother.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.567
I love you, Mrs. Murray.
You know I'm kidding.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.400
All right, Murr,
let's teach this class.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.900
Look at him there.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.567
The mad scientist reunites
with his creator.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.833
So family gets used
a lot in the show.

20:57.833 --> 21:01.633
Are there rules to that?
Was this crossing the line?

21:01.633 --> 21:04.900
No, it made sense.
I get the joke.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.233
I just didn't expect
to ever

21:06.233 --> 21:07.900
take my father
through my cellphone.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.833
The best thing about
a smartphone, okay,

21:09.833 --> 21:11.333
is that you basically
have a camera

21:11.333 --> 21:12.833
in your pocket
at all times.

21:12.833 --> 21:15.333
You know how you and Mom
have photo albums in the closet?

21:15.333 --> 21:17.333
You want to take a look
at some of my photos?

21:21.433 --> 21:23.233
Let me...

21:23.233 --> 21:25.667
I'll take you through
some of the photos on my phone.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.067
Stop right there!
What's that?

21:27.067 --> 21:28.400
Stop right there.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.633
That's me
on a motorcycle.

21:30.633 --> 21:33.800
Q: Why are you thrusting
into the seat?

21:33.800 --> 21:35.900
Thought it was funny.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.333
Ballpark -- how many times has
Murray's dad rolled his eyes

21:38.333 --> 21:40.133
and been like, "I should have
had a third daughter"?

21:40.133 --> 21:42.700
Well, he did have
a third daughter, he just...

21:42.700 --> 21:44.567
not a good one.
-He named it James.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.933
The blanket came back
into play again.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.600
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.767
People want to know, like,
what's up with this blankie,

21:51.767 --> 21:54.067
'cause we've seen it burned,
we've seen it not burned.

21:54.067 --> 21:56.400
-Burn it!
-Burn it!

21:58.633 --> 22:00.800
-Wasn't your blankie!

22:04.800 --> 22:07.200
Shay, who you know
on our TV show,

22:07.200 --> 22:09.833
broke in to my apartment
and stole my blankie

22:09.833 --> 22:11.333
and had a professional
seamstress

22:11.333 --> 22:13.667
create
two identical blankies.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.067
I show up on set that day
and I thought it was legit.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.633
I get home
that day from filming.

22:17.633 --> 22:19.767
Oh, my God. My blankie
was still there on my bed.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.067
And I sleep
with it still, now.

22:21.067 --> 22:23.867
What do you think
James Murray's opinion --

22:23.867 --> 22:27.067
the three worst punishments
you've ever had.

22:27.067 --> 22:29.367
Um...
Danica McKellar.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.067
Novocaine.

22:34.067 --> 22:37.067
Ray's brief is...
Ray's beef is brilliant.

22:37.067 --> 22:39.167
My number one is a tie.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.733
It's sky diving,
lie detector,

22:40.733 --> 22:44.200
things up my butt,
nude modeling, and sharks.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.100
Those --
it's a tie. It's --

22:46.100 --> 22:47.600
Your number one
is a tie up between

22:47.600 --> 22:49.300
five different punishments?

22:49.300 --> 22:50.733
Also strip high-five.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.100
-Six.
-Six.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.100
What was the story with
the video with the...humping?

22:57.100 --> 22:58.700
When the guys and I
go on tour,

22:58.700 --> 23:00.867
I have to iron my clothes
before the show.

23:00.867 --> 23:02.500
So sometimes I record
these videos dancing

23:02.500 --> 23:05.767
of only my crotch
and send it out to people.

23:10.133 --> 23:11.300
That's all for "Insider."

23:11.300 --> 23:13.500
Please enjoy bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

23:15.633 --> 23:17.433
You guys
do any online shopping?

23:17.433 --> 23:19.400
"Let's say you're out
and about shopping in town.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.067
And let's say you're
at Coffin Depot

23:21.067 --> 23:22.833
and you see something you like."

23:22.833 --> 23:24.367
Let's say
you're at, uh...

23:24.367 --> 23:25.867
You know, if you're
shopping around town,

23:25.867 --> 23:27.233
you're at Coffin Depot,
you're like --

23:27.233 --> 23:29.933
you see something you like.

23:29.933 --> 23:31.267
Coffin Depot.

23:31.267 --> 23:34.433
"Go home, go on
to Coffin Depot online."

23:34.433 --> 23:36.933
You go home to
Coffin Depot online

23:36.933 --> 23:38.600
and you pick up
a casket right there.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.933
What the hell is Coffin...

23:39.933 --> 23:42.233
It's where you get coffins
at a deep discount.
