00:06.000 --> 00:12.074

00:13.199 --> 00:16.999
Tonight -
Richard spins off the track. Twice!

00:16.999 --> 00:18.599
Agh!

00:18.599 --> 00:20.399
Jay Kay tries to get to number one.

00:20.399 --> 00:22.719
And Germany or Britain -
which is best?

00:31.639 --> 00:33.239
Thank you, hello.

00:33.239 --> 00:34.760
Hello and welcome.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.560
Thanks very much.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.759
Now...

00:38.759 --> 00:41.240
now, after our...

00:41.240 --> 00:45.880
our recent trip to Japan,
where I raced the Bullet Train,

00:45.880 --> 00:51.080
I stayed on for an extra day
to drive the Nissan GT-R
around the track.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.479
James, on the other hand, decided
to stay on for a little while

00:54.479 --> 01:00.280
as he wanted to drive a car that
he claimed would be more relevant
to the average British motorist

01:00.280 --> 01:03.799
than a jumped up £50,000 Datsun.

01:08.519 --> 01:12.640
Now, I'm fairly confident you
won't have seen one of these before.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.400
Are you ready?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.840
It's called the Orochi.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.640
It's looks are based on a fish,
a snake and Pamela Anderson's mouth.

01:30.399 --> 01:32.599
I rather like it.

01:32.599 --> 01:37.240
It costs £44,000. It's made
by a company called Mitsuoka.

01:38.879 --> 01:44.039
You've probably never heard of them
either, but they are a proper
Japanese car maker.

01:44.039 --> 01:47.080
In fact, they're the tenth biggest
car maker in the country,

01:47.080 --> 01:52.040
after Toyota, Nissan, Honda
and six others.

01:57.239 --> 02:02.800
Mitsuoka makes the chassis, the body
and the interior all by itself,

02:02.800 --> 02:06.280
but the engine,
a 3.3 litre V6, comes from Toyota.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.400
So, it looks like a sports car,
but is it any good as one?

02:16.400 --> 02:23.639
Well, it isn't very fast, it
doesn't make much noise and the
ride is surprisingly comfortable.

02:23.639 --> 02:27.599
By which I mean the ride is
rather excellent for a supercar,

02:27.599 --> 02:30.280
so, obviously,
I think it suits me rather well.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.840
Although, Hammond and Clarkson might
like to continue to shop around.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.159
But Mitsuoka makes another car,
which, on paper,
is even more up my street.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.199
Here it is,
and it's called the Galue.

02:49.199 --> 02:52.160
That foremost social commentator,
Alan Partridge,

02:52.160 --> 02:55.799
once said that the Lexus
is Japan's Mercedes Benz.

02:55.799 --> 03:00.839
In which case, the Mitsuoka Galue
could be - but this is only a hunch -

03:00.839 --> 03:03.119
Japan's Rolls Royce.

03:05.480 --> 03:11.800
But at a nice,
un-Rolls-Royce-ish price,
because it cost an agreeable £32,000.

03:13.439 --> 03:19.119
But looking like a Rolls-Royce
is one thing - feeling like a
Rolls-Royce is completely different.

03:20.200 --> 03:27.119
So, to find out whether it does or
not, the producers have arranged for
me to do a spot of VIP chauffeuring.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.400
Not him.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.319
Them.

03:32.319 --> 03:37.520
Yes, the local sumo wrestler and his
manager need taking to a tournament.

03:39.239 --> 03:40.400
Konichiwa.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.199
That's exhausted my Japanese.

03:45.199 --> 03:49.559
Right, back to the Japanese
Rolls-Royce.

03:49.559 --> 03:57.039
Inside the Galue, Mitsuoka has
recreated the ambience of a proper,
old school, British luxury car.

03:57.039 --> 04:01.119
There's some wood. Ish.
Plush leather seats.

04:01.119 --> 04:07.879
But look at this - this clock
is exactly, roughly like the one
on the new Rolls-Royce Phantom.

04:07.879 --> 04:12.880
It's like one of those fake expensive
watches you get in Thailand.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.999
Only a real expert
can tell the difference.

04:14.999 --> 04:20.000
I am a Rolls-Royce expert,
and I was completely taken in.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.800
Actually, I didn't mean that.
What I meant to say was,
it's an utterly shameless rip-off,

04:24.800 --> 04:27.400
and I can't believe
they're getting away with it.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.760
So, what about the
performance from the 3.5 litre V6?

04:31.760 --> 04:34.760
Is that the genuine article?

04:34.760 --> 04:38.120
A Rolls-Royce must be able to
whoosh away from a stand still.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.040
It can go quite quickly,
but it must never feel urgent,
it must swell very gently,

04:43.040 --> 04:45.839
it must be an orchestral performance.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.040
Which that isn't. Sorry.

04:51.119 --> 04:53.399
Next, handling.

04:53.399 --> 04:59.240
A Rolls-Royce should never allow
its driver to corner too vigorously
because that would be bad form.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.799
It must encourage you
to rein things back.

05:03.959 --> 05:08.960
Clearly, it's not quite right in
that respect. Very sorry. Very sorry.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.520
I cracked on with the job
of delivering my VIPs.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.519
Happy?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.840
Very close to the destination.

05:25.319 --> 05:28.599
THEY SPEAK IN JAPANESE

05:28.599 --> 05:31.640
What? Is that it?

05:31.640 --> 05:33.320
Oh.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.559
MAN ON PA SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

05:47.679 --> 05:49.840
I think they were completely fooled.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.199
As some of you may have found out
last week, I have got an old Rolls,

05:59.199 --> 06:02.879
and let me tell you, the Galue
isn't even on the same planet.

06:02.879 --> 06:06.919
But you know what,
this car does make me smile.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.720
It's not taking itself too seriously.

06:11.720 --> 06:16.520
It's just a bit of fun. It's a bit
like one of those tribute bands.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.879
Bjorn Again,
Let's Zep, the Strolling Bones.

06:20.879 --> 06:25.199
Like those bands,
it knows it's not the real thing,

06:25.199 --> 06:30.320
but, more importantly, it knows
you know it's not the real thing.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.319
evening you're still just as drunk,

06:34.319 --> 06:37.199
and you've still had a great time,
but it only cost you a fiver.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.919
Is that car going to be sold
in the UK?

06:49.919 --> 06:52.199
No. Good. Richard?

06:52.199 --> 06:57.879
Yes. KTM are an Austrian bike
manufacturer, and they make things
like this, the Duke, and it's great.

06:57.879 --> 07:00.759
But now they've decided to have
a go at a car, and here it is.

07:00.759 --> 07:02.720
It's called the Crossbow.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.719
The body's made of plastic panels,
just like it is on the bike.

07:06.719 --> 07:09.239
You can see the innards,
like you can on the bike.

07:09.239 --> 07:12.600
And you have to wear a
crash helmet to drive it,
like you do on the bike.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.720
It really is a stripped
out track car.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.920
All you get is a seat,
a steering wheel

07:16.920 --> 07:22.160
and a two-litre turbo-charged Audi
engine that's enough to take it to
60 miles an hour in four seconds.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.000
Apparently, KTM say it is
quite a handful,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.959
and as a result they won't sell it
to drivers under 24 years old.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.520
Just one thing - Lewis Hamilton.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.359
He's 23!

07:35.120 --> 07:42.199
The thing about that is it costs
£43,000, which seems like a lot for
a motorcycle with two extra wheels.

07:42.199 --> 07:46.360
No, it isn't. Well, it is.
You could drive that thing
through - what's it's called?

07:46.360 --> 07:51.999
Oxbow? - you could drive that through
a light shower and you could
come out on the other side

07:51.999 --> 07:55.519
without your internal organs being
transplanted into someone else.

07:55.519 --> 08:02.320
You don't get bikes. You two live
in fear that you'll go through the
pearly gates with your leathers on,

08:02.320 --> 08:07.839
knowing full well that
I'm back on Earth, as a car driver,

08:07.839 --> 08:09.680
with your liver.

08:09.680 --> 08:15.080
And don't think I'm going to do
anything useful with it because I'm
just going to make it into a hat.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.719
I actually carry a card that says,

08:17.719 --> 08:23.480
"I do not wish to help Jeremy
Clarkson be amusing in
the event of my death."

08:23.480 --> 08:30.520
Fair enough. Every year, the
Scouts make a series of awards,
which are relevant to them.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.239
I've got the list here. They've
just announced this year's winners.

08:33.239 --> 08:37.759
Previous winners have included
Charlie Boorman and Ewan MacGregor.
They won best navigation award.

08:37.759 --> 08:39.839
Jamie Oliver
won the healthy eating award.

08:39.839 --> 08:46.000
Yeah. Now, Ray Mears has not won
the award for services of wearing
shorts when you're a grown man.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.639
However, their award, this year,
for services to instruction

08:52.639 --> 08:55.040
has gone...to the Stig.

09:01.160 --> 09:08.279
However, there's a problem,
a really big problem. They came
down earlier to give him his badge,

09:08.279 --> 09:10.879
and he attacked them.

09:10.879 --> 09:14.000
We've got some footage
of it here, seriously.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.240
Look.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.960
He's trying to stamp on
his badge, he hates it.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.160
And they took him down. They actually
took the Stig down, two Scouts.

09:26.200 --> 09:34.039
It's awkward, that. It turns
out he's terrified of Scouts.

09:34.039 --> 09:40.079
Now, bad news - this week, James
popped to see me at my local pub,

09:40.079 --> 09:45.640
parked his motorcycle, outside,
not illegally...

09:45.640 --> 09:51.519
No, very considerately. That's
right, it was illegally parked,
but not inconsiderate. Exactly.

09:51.519 --> 09:55.480
Fined £120. 120 quid.

09:55.480 --> 10:01.559
Now, here's the thing, all right -
both of us, in the not too distant
past, have had televisions stolen.

10:01.559 --> 10:06.679
So how come they've got the
man power to find your slightly
illegally parked motorcycle

10:06.679 --> 10:09.080
when they say that can't find
our televisions?

10:09.080 --> 10:13.599
I don't understand it.
I rang up the woman on the parking
ticket hotline enquiry hotline

10:13.599 --> 10:18.480
and I said to her, "Have you
found my television?" She had no
idea what I was talking about.

10:18.480 --> 10:23.039
I think that if you've had
something stolen in your life...

10:23.039 --> 10:25.640
How many people here have had
something stolen? The lawnmower...

10:25.640 --> 10:27.479
Nearly everybody.

10:27.479 --> 10:31.559
..it should be illegal
for the police to do you
for a trivial motoring offence

10:31.559 --> 10:34.679
until they've returned whatever
it is you've had stolen! Yes!

10:34.679 --> 10:36.639
Does anybody here think...?

10:36.639 --> 10:38.399
APPLAUSE

10:40.319 --> 10:42.399
Seriously...

10:42.399 --> 10:47.999
if you're watching this, Mr Brown,
that's 100% of British people
agree with me.

10:47.999 --> 10:53.279
Now, hey, TVR... You know it was
bought by a Russian
business boy, a few years ago?

10:53.279 --> 10:56.039
Actually it was bought by his father
as a sort of play set for him,

10:56.039 --> 10:59.679
and he crashed it into a hillside
and now TVR's gone. Very sad.

10:59.679 --> 11:03.880
However, turns out he still owns
the intellectual property rights,

11:03.880 --> 11:07.360
and he still owns the moulds, and he
says he's going to bring TVR back.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.640
We've actually got a picture
of him, testing these
new models with his friends.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.360
He said he was going to announce
which model would come back first,

11:16.360 --> 11:20.119
but then his mum said he
had to come inside for his tea.

11:20.119 --> 11:22.280
Hey. Great news. What?

11:22.280 --> 11:26.119
I've been sent more
information on the Dacia Sandero.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.880
Excellent!

11:27.880 --> 11:31.040
Excellent. Now,
you know the new Citroen Berlingo?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.879
This is a car we like very much.

11:32.879 --> 11:38.240
It costs less than £11,000, and for
that you get a big, spacious car,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.480
with the best ride of any car
under a Rolls-Royce.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.839
I've been thinking, how do they do a
car like that for less than 11 grand?

11:45.839 --> 11:48.040
So I went on the internet
and I found this.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.839
Yep.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.679
Afterwards, OK, I found this -
it's the Citroen website.

12:06.679 --> 12:09.839
You know how they list what
a car comes with as standard?

12:09.839 --> 12:15.839
You can tell when a car firm
is desperate when they've got
"laminated front wind screen".

12:15.839 --> 12:19.120
Wow! As opposed to what? A sheet
of glass nicked from a greenhouse?

12:19.120 --> 12:23.120
It gets better. It's got a
"single front passenger seat".

12:23.120 --> 12:27.400
Huh? And "manually adjustable
door mirrors".

12:27.400 --> 12:32.080
As opposed to what? The only
alternative is electrical, isn't it?

12:32.080 --> 12:37.439
That's just saying it's something it
hasn't got. It hasn't got electrical
door mirrors, no alloy wheels...

12:37.439 --> 12:43.120
It's a very good car, so long
as you want something that's
equipped like a Romanian jail.

12:43.120 --> 12:48.479
I've got a question. What?
What if this turns out to be
really good? Well, it won't.

12:48.479 --> 12:51.640
No, but what if it does?
Well, it won't, will it?

12:51.640 --> 12:55.679
It's the new Chevy Camaro.
And they're really thought about it.
It looks brilliant.

12:55.679 --> 12:59.840
It's got a 6.2 litre V8,
and they've given it
independent suspension all round.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.879
Wooooow!

13:01.879 --> 13:08.240
Independent?! So they've looked at
a car and thought, "It's got
four separate wheels.

13:08.240 --> 13:14.200
"What if we treated them all
sort of separate?" Like they've
been doing in Europe for 100 years?

13:14.200 --> 13:17.840
I still think what if that turns
out to be good?! We don't know yet!

13:17.840 --> 13:23.199
Richard, the Americans are
good at herding bison. The end.

13:23.199 --> 13:28.199
I still maintain it might turn
out to be good, then we'll all
want one. What is this underneath?

13:28.199 --> 13:30.760
It's a Vauxhall VXR,

13:30.760 --> 13:34.999
so what the Americans have done
is they've gone, "We need
some sophistication here -

13:34.999 --> 13:37.240
"we'll call the Australians."

13:37.240 --> 13:43.240
That is like saying, "I want
some style for my wedding,
I'll get seven crates of lager."

13:43.240 --> 13:46.879
You're the sort of person I could
show you a picture of Paris Hilton

13:46.879 --> 13:50.159
and you'd say, "What if she
turns out to be intelligent?"

13:50.159 --> 13:53.000
But what if she did?!
What if she did?!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.079
That's enough news.

13:55.079 --> 13:57.040
Now, Mazda.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.880
Over the years, they've built up
a fearsome reputation for making
very sensible small cars

14:01.880 --> 14:06.160
and the worst television
commercials in all of human history.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.760
This, however,
is their latest creation.

14:08.760 --> 14:14.720
Plainly, they wanted to give
it a name which conjured up
an image of aggression and anger,

14:14.720 --> 14:17.999
but the job of naming it was given
to somebody from Birmingham,

14:17.999 --> 14:21.640
so it's ended up being called
the Furai.

14:21.640 --> 14:28.479
The chassis is from an American Le
Mans racer, which is the same as a
European Le Mans racer, only fatter.

14:28.479 --> 14:33.959
Body - that was clearly designed
by someone with a Batman fixation.

14:33.959 --> 14:38.559
I think it looks brilliant - although
if you take it to a film premiere,

14:38.559 --> 14:41.800
it'll probably take a swing
at its sister.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.120
Allegedly, of course.

14:44.120 --> 14:49.000
The engine, Wankel,
1.9 litre, 460 brake horsepower,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.400
2.6 miles to the gallon.

14:52.400 --> 14:58.200
And, annoyingly, broken.
Which means we can't put
it round our test track.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.239
Instead, I'm going to answer
a question that a viewer has asked.
I have their letter here.

15:03.239 --> 15:05.600
It says, "Dear so called Top Gear,

15:05.600 --> 15:11.120
" I'm aware that there are many
elegant and dramatic supercars
that I could buy..."

15:11.120 --> 15:15.280
Things like these. "..but as I'm the
victim of a botched eye operation,

15:15.280 --> 15:19.079
"what I want is a supercar
that is catastrophically ugly.

15:19.079 --> 15:22.559
"Can you help?" Yes, I think I can.

15:24.599 --> 15:26.999
This could be the
answer to your problems.

15:26.999 --> 15:33.200
It's a new supercar from Germany -
and, well, it's not exactly a looker.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.639
Let me put it this way.

15:36.639 --> 15:38.320
When Jeremy did the Alfa 8C...

15:40.640 --> 15:45.520
..the camera crew found there
wasn't a single angle that didn't
make the car look brilliant.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.560
This is the exact opposite.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.400
No. No.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.240
Really, no.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.399
And then there's the problem
of the name.

15:59.399 --> 16:06.879
Does it have one of those sexy ones,
like all the sexiest cars have -
Vanquish, Viper, Raptor?

16:06.879 --> 16:10.640
No. It's called a Gumpert.

16:10.640 --> 16:16.040
So, it's got looks
only a mother could love and a
name like a Northern comedian.

16:18.040 --> 16:22.600
And for the privilege of driving it,
you'll need £250,000.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.600
This does beg the question,
what do you get for your money?

16:26.600 --> 16:30.800
Certainly, you're not buying a
wondrous Zonda-esque interior.

16:30.800 --> 16:38.960
It's just a random collection of
bits from Audi.

16:40.799 --> 16:46.040
Well, yes, but don't go looking
for night-vision or a bathroom.

16:46.040 --> 16:50.759
And this, the rear-view camera,
doesn't count.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.200
That's a necessity.
There's no back window.

16:55.359 --> 17:00.359
Options on the Gumpert are things
like this - the traction control.

17:01.960 --> 17:07.598
Now, lots of cars have traction
control, but the Gumpert's
is really quite anorakey.

17:07.598 --> 17:12.759
It's not a button, it's a knob.
You can adjust it so you can be
precise. So, Hammerhead coming up.

17:12.759 --> 17:14.319
I know this corner.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.760
17%, I think.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.720
Yeah, that...

17:25.720 --> 17:28.280
But worry not.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.960
If that doesn't work out,
there are whole load of
other things you can adjust.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.600
You can change the camber,
the ride height, the spring tension,

17:36.600 --> 17:39.359
the damper, bump and rebound
and the anti-roll bar.

17:41.039 --> 17:43.120
Oh, yeah!

17:43.120 --> 17:48.400
There you are, Monte Carlo, Claudia
Schiffer, in your supercar -
"Please can we go to the party now?"

17:48.400 --> 17:52.920
"No, hold on. A lot of corners. I'm
gonna dial in some extra camber."

17:55.199 --> 17:57.599
With the camber adjusted,
I went for...

17:57.599 --> 17:59.039
Oh, bugger.

18:01.839 --> 18:06.320
I think some of those settings are
not an option. Just leave them alone!

18:08.639 --> 18:13.799
I've had this experience with
one of my bikes. All you ever do is
make things worse.

18:14.840 --> 18:20.519
There is one option this car doesn't
have, and it's one I quite like.

18:20.519 --> 18:23.440
The option to move your seat
backwards and forwards.

18:23.440 --> 18:29.039
That's because the Gumpert people
got fed up with drivers
moving their seats around

18:29.039 --> 18:31.679
and messing up their perfect
weight distribution.

18:34.719 --> 18:40.760
So, minging looks, seats you
can't move and gizmos only Lewis
Hamilton can make sense of.

18:40.760 --> 18:45.599
I think you're getting the picture by
now that this is no Riviera cruiser.

18:45.599 --> 18:52.120
Their fastest version, the Apollo
Race, has 800 brake horsepower, but
if you've passed your driving test,

18:52.120 --> 18:58.960
they do do what they call
an entry-level version, 650 brake
horsepower. This is the mid-range.

18:58.960 --> 19:04.079
I suppose they'd call it the
Popular Plus - 700 brake horsepower.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.879
And this is where
it all starts to come good

19:08.879 --> 19:12.599
because whichever Gumpert you choose,
it's going to be fast.

19:20.479 --> 19:21.680
Ye gods!

19:25.160 --> 19:27.719
This is just something else!

19:28.799 --> 19:34.159
The engine is Audi's 4.2 litre V8,
but with added twin turbos,

19:34.159 --> 19:37.400
all wrapped up in
featherweight carbon fibre.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.720
0-60 - three seconds.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.399
Top speed - 224mph.

19:44.399 --> 19:48.680
So, let's see how much of that
we can get on our modest runway.

19:53.079 --> 19:56.039
That's 200 kilometres per hour.
That's 120 mph.

19:59.159 --> 20:02.559
That's 280 kilometres an hour,
which is very fast.

20:05.879 --> 20:07.960
300 kilometres an hour.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.600
I'm gonna start breaking, I think.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.119
That's 186 miles an hour

20:13.119 --> 20:15.479
in 1.7 miles.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.279
And when you get to a corner, just
as long as you've not been fiddling
with anything, it is brilliant.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.599
The grip!

20:30.599 --> 20:34.280
My eyes are a foot
that side of my head!

20:37.000 --> 20:42.519
Suddenly you realise why this thing
looks like a boil on the buttock
of a baboon.

20:42.519 --> 20:46.519
It's got downforce, that's what all
those holes, fins and grills are for.

20:56.519 --> 21:03.599
If you want a supercar you can park
with pride in Monte Carlo's Casino
Square, this probably isn't for you.

21:04.719 --> 21:08.920
There are many other cars that
will do that job much better.

21:08.920 --> 21:13.879
But the Gumpert guys in their
little German factory have
gone down another path.

21:13.879 --> 21:15.160
Hardcore Street.

21:17.999 --> 21:23.600
I do believe that on this track
old Quasimodo here could destroy
every supercar alive.

21:38.920 --> 21:45.839
Are you really suggesting this is
gonna be quicker round the track
that lots of the really fast cars?

21:45.839 --> 21:49.160
It is unbelievably quick, but I tell
you the amazing thing about this car.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.880
You know I said it generates
downforce to stick it to the road?

21:51.880 --> 21:59.120
Well, Gumpert say it generates so
much that it could drive upside down
and still stick to the roof...

21:59.120 --> 22:03.679
Don't fall for that old chestnut!
Every Formula One team says you
could drive our cars upside down.

22:03.679 --> 22:07.480
The only reason they say that is
because we can't prove them wrong.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.599
Yeah, but Gumpert
are going to prove it.

22:09.599 --> 22:12.439
They've built an engine
that will work upside down.

22:12.439 --> 22:15.280
And the tunnel? And they found
a tunnel they can do it in.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.920
So how fast do you have to
drive to generate enough
downforce or upforce to stick it?

22:20.920 --> 22:26.120
190 miles an hour. So they're gonna
get someone to drive at 190mph
down the roof of a tunnel,

22:26.120 --> 22:29.159
swerving between all the signposts,
fans and lights!

22:29.159 --> 22:32.279
That's the thing, they found
the tunnel to do it in,

22:32.279 --> 22:36.639
but they've not yet found anyone
stupid enough to drive it.

22:36.639 --> 22:38.920
Well, this is the last show.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.200
No, I can't.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.359
I can't. I'm busy.

22:43.359 --> 22:46.199
I'm painting...my horse.

22:46.199 --> 22:50.559
I can't do it.
Anyway, we must now find out
how fast it goes round our track,

22:50.559 --> 22:53.720
which means we must put it in the
hands of our tame racing driver.

22:53.720 --> 23:00.359
Some say it's impossible
for him to wear socks.

23:00.359 --> 23:04.600
And he can open a beer bottle
with his testes.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.839
All we know is he's called the Stig.

23:07.839 --> 23:10.280
And he's off, not a scorching start.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.560
Stig just carefully metering out
the power, of which there is a lot.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.679
First corner now, hopefully
he will be going faster
to get that downforce working.

23:19.679 --> 23:21.959
That is neat,
I've got high hopes for this.

23:23.279 --> 23:26.079
MUSIC: "Daniel" by Elton John

23:28.520 --> 23:33.759
Yeah, Stig is apparently
still touched by Elton John.

23:33.759 --> 23:36.200
That is fantastically
controlled through Chicago.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.159
Hammerhead now, slower corner.

23:38.159 --> 23:41.680
Could be in trouble if the fancy
aerodynamics can't do their stuff.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.520
It's so undramatic and I expect
that could be this car's secret.

23:48.040 --> 23:52.240
The follow-through - really pin
it open now, will he have to lift?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.320
Not likely!

23:54.320 --> 23:59.120
You can almost see it being pressed
into the tarmac, it's so flat through
the corners like a racing car.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.440
Finally biting back,
and across the line.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.640
Hang on, hang on. Wait!

24:10.640 --> 24:16.240
If you're right, it's gonna be up
with the Zonda, the Ascari...

24:16.240 --> 24:19.519
Yep, Ascari did it in 1.17.3.

24:19.519 --> 24:25.279
The Gumbert did it in it 1.17.1!

24:25.279 --> 24:27.239
It is the fastest!

24:31.679 --> 24:33.880
Fastest ever around our track.

24:35.399 --> 24:42.760
That really is incredible because
that is the first car Hammond has
driven round our circuit this year.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.440
And it's gone to the top of the
leaderboard...which he can't reach.

24:49.599 --> 24:52.640
I can, I can! I just need a run up.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.599
This is going to be undignified.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.880
It's not worked.

24:58.880 --> 25:05.360
It's on!

25:06.640 --> 25:08.840
OK, that's one...

25:08.840 --> 25:13.040
that's one lap record smashed,
quite literally.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.760
Now, let's see if we can't
deal with another one.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.919
This is a list of the stars who've
driven our reasonably priced car

25:19.919 --> 25:26.960
and Simon Cowell has now been at
the top for the last two series,
which we think is long enough.

25:26.960 --> 25:32.720
So what we've done is we went back
and looked at all the people who
drove our old reasonably priced car,

25:32.720 --> 25:37.000
found the biggest petrol head
and invited him back.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jay Kay!

25:44.999 --> 25:47.359
How are you? Have a seat.

25:47.359 --> 25:49.119
Thank you.

25:49.119 --> 25:50.480
Wa-hay!

25:51.560 --> 25:53.320
Wa-hay!

25:53.320 --> 25:58.880
You have been nagging to be here.
Honestly, there hasn't
been a week go by...

25:58.880 --> 26:01.040
How long is it since you were here?

26:01.040 --> 26:05.879
I was here on the first series,
I think I was the second guy.

26:05.879 --> 26:12.439
You were the second guest ever.
There hasn't been a week
really gone by since then

26:12.439 --> 26:15.640
when you haven't been on the
phone going can I come back?

26:15.640 --> 26:22.199
I have to say I felt left out,
lonely, sat in my kitchen
watching it thinking,

26:22.199 --> 26:23.920
"When will I come back?

26:23.920 --> 26:29.120
"When will I beat the man
with the codpiece?" Oh, Simon?

26:29.120 --> 26:30.920
Codpiece Cowell!

26:30.920 --> 26:34.999
I've just remembered something, what
was it you said to the researcher?

26:34.999 --> 26:38.999
When we rang up and
said can you come back...
I said I'm down here for war.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.680
He did! I'm down here for war!

26:41.680 --> 26:49.000
I'm not here to muck about, not here
to be 13th, not here to beat James
Blunt, I'm here to be on the top.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.679
So first or nothing else will do?

26:51.679 --> 26:55.120
I'm not here to beat James
Blunt's album sales either.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.519
How many have you sold in total?
25 million or something.

26:58.519 --> 27:02.519
25 million and you can't read music.
Thank you, everybody.

27:02.519 --> 27:06.199
Thank you.
APPLAUSE

27:07.799 --> 27:10.399
That is a lot of albums.

27:10.399 --> 27:14.279
I won't bother going through
the list of everything you've got

27:14.279 --> 27:16.959
because the programme
is only an hour long.

27:16.959 --> 27:19.319
But how many cars
have you got these days?

27:19.319 --> 27:23.359
There are 37 vehicles,
that's including motorbikes,

27:23.359 --> 27:25.439
and staff cars.

27:25.439 --> 27:28.319
Staff cars!

27:28.319 --> 27:33.440
They don't have little flags
and swastikas on!

27:33.440 --> 27:37.240
Or two wheels at the front
and a half track at the back.

27:37.240 --> 27:42.119
Since you were last here,
what have been the main changes?

27:42.119 --> 27:46.799
The main stuff is that I've got into
Porsches, for some unknown reason.

27:46.799 --> 27:54.359
About three or four years ago,
I bought an RS Touring, which is
the factory sunroof, rear-seat 911,

27:54.359 --> 27:58.039
Carrera down the side,
wide arches, 2.7 engine.

27:58.039 --> 28:04.799
Then I got a 911 3T GRS, the reason
being because I thought this car
is gonna be a future classic...

28:04.799 --> 28:08.440
Present at 997? A 997 GT 3RS, yeah.

28:08.440 --> 28:14.239
I've then subsequently gone and
got myself a 911 RS light weight.

28:14.239 --> 28:19.839
I still genuinely don't get
the appeal of 911s. Right.

28:19.839 --> 28:22.799
Have you driven a modern-day Turbo?

28:22.799 --> 28:25.560
Not for a while.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.400
Or even a GT3 RS.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.639
I drive that and think,
"Actually, this is a nice car,"

28:31.639 --> 28:37.360
then I got into a GT2 the other day,
the new GT2. The Turbo, yeah.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.080
It's absolutely, hideously horrid.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.200
What don't you like about it? It does
everything you expect a 911 to do.

28:45.200 --> 28:50.600
Do you know what I mean by
that front end bounce
and that understeer?

28:50.600 --> 28:56.159
If you do anything about the
understeer, they switch immediately
to death-dealing oversteer.

28:56.159 --> 28:59.359
Could it be you're not
driving it properly?

28:59.359 --> 29:01.160
I turned the steering wheel!

29:01.160 --> 29:08.680
That light weight you've got...
Air-cooled. Yeah, the air-cooled one
is one day going to kill you.

29:08.680 --> 29:14.559
It's sitting in your garage now
plotting how it's going to do it.
Has anyone here got a 911?

29:14.559 --> 29:16.759
See, they've all been killed.

29:16.759 --> 29:21.200
They were on their way and they're
all now in a tree like that.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.720
I just don't get them. Brilliant.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.599
There are a number
of other things. Yeah.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.479
He's got a Mercedes Grosser.

29:30.479 --> 29:34.399
Mine was owned by Coco Chanel. It
was actually owned by Coco Chanel?

29:34.399 --> 29:38.279
Mine was owned by the
Egyptian ambassador.

29:38.279 --> 29:42.640
When I get in it,
I just cover myself in No.5.

29:42.640 --> 29:48.200
And you've got a CSL BMW now.
Tell us about the GQ awards.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.880
Yes, another thing we've got in
common, we've both won awards...

29:51.880 --> 29:54.560
You got Worst Dressed Man,
I got Style Man of the Year.

29:55.839 --> 29:57.719
Mind you...

29:57.719 --> 30:00.119
Look, dear, I like them.

30:00.119 --> 30:04.640
Get off! Show the people at the back.
There's nothing wrong with them!

30:04.640 --> 30:07.760
Style of the year?
LAUGHTER

30:07.760 --> 30:09.759
They're nice! It's not nice.

30:09.759 --> 30:13.559
It's hideous. Just because
Alpinestars don't make you shoes.

30:13.559 --> 30:16.959
No, cos I go to a shoe shop and say,
"Have you got a pair of shoes?"

30:16.959 --> 30:20.000
"Have you got a pair
of shoes for a hippo?"

30:22.120 --> 30:28.559
We have talked about cars enough.
It's great talking to you. We do
genuinely share the same passions.

30:28.559 --> 30:31.359
We do like the same motors.

30:31.359 --> 30:35.039
We do have the same sort of cars.
Yeah. Right, the lap.

30:35.039 --> 30:41.079
Yeah. When you came the last time,
it was old Stig. What is new
Stig like now he's regenerated?

30:41.079 --> 30:45.759
I have been out with the new Stig.
He's in the master class, isn't he?

30:45.759 --> 30:49.919
I've just been out in that C63.
He is an extremely good driver.

30:49.919 --> 30:53.399
He is quicker than Lewis Hamilton,
Nigel Mansell and Mark Webber.

30:53.399 --> 30:59.120
The funny thing is,
when you're talking to him....
We'd just had dinner, chatting away,

30:59.120 --> 31:01.559
I asked what he was going to have.
"You gonna have ribs and coleslaw?"

31:01.559 --> 31:05.360
You suddenly find you are talking
to this guy with this screen.

31:05.360 --> 31:10.360
What happens, he lifts it up for
a bit of air, you start doing that,

31:10.360 --> 31:16.959
then he goes...and shuts it again.
He is filtering out the carbon
dioxide. He runs on pure nitrogen.

31:16.959 --> 31:20.760
Anyway, he coached you? He did.

31:20.760 --> 31:25.880
You had your nine laps. Obviously,
there's no point saying this week,
where do you think you've come?

31:25.880 --> 31:28.799
You want to be here, don't you?

31:28.799 --> 31:33.040
What can I say, but yes, yes, yes!

31:33.040 --> 31:36.359
More than the next Grammy? Yes!

31:36.359 --> 31:41.880
I mean, do you know,
people stop me in the street and go,
"When are you back on Top Gear?

31:41.880 --> 31:45.920
"When are you going to beat
Simon Cowell." They don't give
a BLEEP about the music!

31:49.160 --> 31:53.560
Get on with it then! No, no.
Simon Cowell is... Agh!

31:53.560 --> 31:56.960
That is what Simon Cowell
is doing at home now! No!

31:56.960 --> 32:00.680
Who wants to see his lap?
AUDIENCE: Yes! OK.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.920
SCREECHING

32:02.920 --> 32:06.920
Nice start. This is the one,
I must beat Mr Codpiece.

32:09.880 --> 32:14.039
Let's have a look at that corner.
Scrubbing!

32:15.599 --> 32:17.999
Agh!

32:17.999 --> 32:24.520
Why are we angry?
Because it is a gutless piece
of American BLEEP and I hate it!

32:24.520 --> 32:30.719
Let's start shaping tiny
bits of Gordon Ramsay parmesan
cheese off this BLEEP.

32:30.719 --> 32:35.240
Gordon Ramsay...
Go on, turn in, you pillock!

32:35.240 --> 32:39.999
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!
I'd have done that tighter.

32:39.999 --> 32:45.479
Come on! You really are a gutless
bit of Yankee BLEEP! Honestly.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.680
You're cutting that corner, we allow
that because it's slippery there.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.760
Agh!

32:51.760 --> 32:56.720
There is a man determined.
Go on, get in there!

32:56.720 --> 33:01.160
That is about as good
as I've ever seen
anyone do the second to last turn.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.559
Get in there! Come on!

33:08.279 --> 33:10.519
Oh, no!

33:10.519 --> 33:12.520
I can't take it!

33:12.520 --> 33:19.519
Do you know,
I was sitting there yesterday,
I thought, "Top Gear tomorrow."

33:19.519 --> 33:26.399
I'm watching The Right Stuff, which I
really enjoy, "Sod it, get to bed and
make sure you are fresh as a daisy."

33:26.399 --> 33:28.759
You had an early night?
I had an early night, yeah.

33:28.759 --> 33:31.960
So you'd be capable of doing this?
So I would be capable of doing this.

33:31.960 --> 33:37.960
What I've got here is a bit of paper
given to me by the producer
with all your nine laps.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.279
It isn't important, this, is it?

33:40.279 --> 33:46.360
There's more important
things going on in the world!
This is not important. Right.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.679
You fastest lap of the nine.
Christ, what is it there?

33:49.679 --> 33:53.680
What was he? 145.9. 145.9.

33:53.680 --> 33:57.479
Come on, surely?
Your fastest lap.

33:57.479 --> 33:58.919
One...

33:58.919 --> 34:04.400
I hate this. I watch other people...
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.879
forty... Oh!

34:05.879 --> 34:08.719
six point two...

34:08.719 --> 34:10.000
Agh!

34:11.080 --> 34:12.918
BLEEP!

34:12.918 --> 34:16.799
was your second...
was your second fastest lap.

34:16.799 --> 34:20.000
EXCITED ROARS
BLEEP!

34:20.000 --> 34:23.159
You BLEEP!

34:23.159 --> 34:25.119
BLEEP!

34:29.960 --> 34:33.438
Look, all I want to do...
146.2 was your second fastest.

34:33.438 --> 34:36.478
Please let me...
You did another 146.2.

34:36.478 --> 34:40.360
148.2. 149?!

34:40.360 --> 34:42.958
That was when I got the wrong gear.

34:42.958 --> 34:46.239
147, 148. Then on lap eight...

34:46.239 --> 34:51.880
That'll be your quickest.
You have 145.9 to beat.

34:51.880 --> 34:52.958
One...

34:52.958 --> 34:55.000
forty...

34:55.000 --> 34:56.560
five...

34:56.560 --> 34:58.079
point...

34:59.080 --> 35:00.400
..eight.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.800
WILD APPLAUSE

35:14.519 --> 35:16.959
Come on! Come on!

35:18.440 --> 35:20.639
Come on!

35:20.639 --> 35:23.320
Well, done, mate.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jay Kay. The new number one.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.439
Thank you.

35:36.439 --> 35:38.240
It was a 145.81.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.160
You can take that home and frame it.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.640
Who's the daddy now?!
Not Simon Cowell.

35:47.320 --> 35:52.880
So we are back in the autumn
and the first guest, I am
guessing will be...Simon Cowell.

35:52.880 --> 35:58.160
Brilliant. Ladies and gentlemen,
the new number one, Jay Kay!

35:58.160 --> 36:01.280
Thank you very much.
CHEERING

36:05.960 --> 36:09.479
Now, there's a new
TV show in Germany.

36:09.479 --> 36:13.360
It's all about cars,
it is hosted by three people.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.359
I can't imagine where they
got that idea from, no idea.

36:17.960 --> 36:24.959
They got in touch with us and
invited us to take them on in
a series of races and challenges.

36:24.959 --> 36:27.320
Obviously, we needed
somewhere to stage this.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.480
I suggested in the skies
over southern England.

36:31.480 --> 36:35.679
In fact, we settled on Belgium,
a country invented so that Britain

36:35.679 --> 36:38.800
and Germany would have somewhere
to sort out their differences.

36:38.800 --> 36:44.360
On that point the producers told us,
"You are representing the BBC,

36:44.360 --> 36:47.320
"you can't just turn up
and go on about the war."

36:51.519 --> 36:57.959
The meet was set for 9:00am
for Belgium's second
best-known race track, Zolder.

37:02.520 --> 37:09.320
And at precisely 9.00am,
our Germans arrived
in their impressive German cars.

37:18.359 --> 37:21.559
In fact, we were not late,
we were simply arriving in style.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.399
Come on, Biggles!

38:08.999 --> 38:11.039
We are on our own, we're...

38:11.039 --> 38:13.199
playing for time and
it is running out!

38:26.200 --> 38:28.479
I think we might have overdone this.

38:28.479 --> 38:32.599
It could be worse,
we could have come in the back of
Bobby Charlton!

38:32.599 --> 38:36.040
Jeremy. Hi. Good to see you.
How are you?

38:36.040 --> 38:41.999
Our small talk was friendly, but,
to be honest, we were a bit nervous.

38:41.999 --> 38:44.480
Sure, they had
a jolly man in a suit.

38:44.480 --> 38:50.399
He is called Carston von Ryssen,
he has no racing experience at all,

38:50.399 --> 38:53.919
but then they also have
Tim Schrick, the touring driver

38:53.919 --> 38:58.280
and Sabine Schmitz,
the Nuerburgring specialist.

39:00.479 --> 39:03.880
They were up against us lot.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.200
The first challenge was
dreamed up by the Germans.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.479
It is called double decker
racing and the idea is simple.

39:11.479 --> 39:16.880
The car on the bottom has
a throttle, brakes and gears
but no steering wheel.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.479
because that is fitted
to the car on top.

39:20.479 --> 39:26.519
Because there are only three
presenters on each side and
you need eight people to operate

39:26.519 --> 39:32.119
the four cars, each team is allowed
to get someone from their film crew
to help out.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.680
That is a problem for the Germans,
because, whilst they have

39:34.680 --> 39:39.239
a sound recordist, a cameraman
and a director, he is the same man.

39:39.239 --> 39:44.879
So their coverage of this race
is going to look like this...

39:44.879 --> 39:50.520
But it is not that brilliant for
us, because, although we have
a very large film crew, there was

39:50.520 --> 39:57.320
only one volunteer to sit above me
and, if I am honest, it is not
the one I would have picked.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.279
Still, he is very brave.

39:59.279 --> 40:01.559
He once fought a shark.

40:01.559 --> 40:03.640
He lost, but anyway!

40:05.359 --> 40:09.279
We do six laps
and have six white stripes.

40:09.279 --> 40:13.439
If you finish the first
one you take one off.

40:13.439 --> 40:18.840
James, will you promise to use
the throttle and not just the brake?

40:18.840 --> 40:21.839
It's a bit odd
not having a steering wheel.

40:21.839 --> 40:25.840
These Metros have quite
good steering, so this is
a good way round to do it.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.199
It doesn't make
a difference, you idiot.

40:28.199 --> 40:31.159
The steering is done by the Metro.
You're steering the Jag.

40:31.159 --> 40:33.640
The good thing is that
they have Golfs on the roof.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.359
Now, Golfs are heavy.

40:35.359 --> 40:37.960
Metros are made out of snake skin.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.040
Right.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.240
Here we go.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.600
Yes!

40:46.600 --> 40:48.159
Hang on, Jeremy.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.880
We have got an early lead!

40:57.759 --> 40:59.440
We're already at the back!

41:05.480 --> 41:07.600
Jesus, that is going to roll over
if we are not careful.

41:10.040 --> 41:13.720
the German system was working well.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.719
Whereas in the Metro squadron...

41:18.719 --> 41:21.759
Look at what
you are doing, left, left.

41:21.759 --> 41:24.599
Left!

41:24.599 --> 41:25.599
Smooth!

41:26.600 --> 41:28.480
Right!

41:28.480 --> 41:32.080
Then there was
a complete communication breakdown.

41:39.639 --> 41:41.080
Whoa! Left, left, left!

41:41.080 --> 41:44.159
The Germans
were now first and second.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.639
This is a disaster!

41:48.639 --> 41:52.360
Then there was another one.
My wing men went mad.

41:52.360 --> 41:55.400
On the inside.

41:55.400 --> 41:59.279
No. No. No! What the hell
have you done that for?

42:04.240 --> 42:08.000
That was your fault.
You're on the bloody steering!

42:08.000 --> 42:10.280
James and Richard think
it's all over, and they're right!

42:12.839 --> 42:16.119
Rubbish, you steered into
the gravel it is designed
to stop Formula One cars.

42:16.119 --> 42:20.680
How the hell do you think a
Jaguar with a Metro on its roof...

42:20.680 --> 42:23.560
This was our darkest hour.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.200
We are being annihilated.

42:26.200 --> 42:31.839
With us out, we could only hope that
Jeremy and Kipp the sound man would
race on cleanly and fairly.

42:31.839 --> 42:34.000
Ram him. Ram!

42:34.880 --> 42:37.000
Go, Kipp.

42:37.919 --> 42:40.240
Yes, they've gone wrong.
We got them.

42:40.240 --> 42:45.079
just off, he was out.

42:46.719 --> 42:50.240
Now it was just us versus Sabine
and a man in a suit.

42:53.360 --> 42:56.360
Come on! There's no fighter escort.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.599
Up the inside, baff, yes!

43:03.160 --> 43:05.320
Go, Kipp. They've gone down!

43:14.159 --> 43:19.159
Keen to defend his country
and his job on Top Gear,
Kipp made a bold move.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.959
That is giving them
something to think about.

43:24.959 --> 43:27.640
It also gave us
something to think about.

43:27.640 --> 43:31.400
Jeremy, my arm's come off!

43:31.400 --> 43:33.359
My arm's come off!

43:33.359 --> 43:37.040
Nobody has ever said that
in a car race before!

43:39.760 --> 43:41.800
We were now on the last lap.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.120
On the inside.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.839
It is quite difficult now, Jeremy.

44:00.159 --> 44:03.239
Oh, no, it is the finish.
No, No!

44:03.239 --> 44:04.479
No!

44:06.560 --> 44:10.360
I've let Britain down, oh, no!

44:10.360 --> 44:15.680
Hopefully, we could redeem ourselves
in the next challenge.

44:19.199 --> 44:21.160
Who makes the fastest cars?

44:21.160 --> 44:24.760
The axis powers or the allies? You
came up with this one, didn't you?

44:24.760 --> 44:27.239
Yes. You haven't thought
it through, have you?

44:27.239 --> 44:29.519
I did. It is brilliantly simple.
A drag race.

44:29.519 --> 44:31.280
Let's meet the contenders.

44:31.280 --> 44:35.560
On their side from Germany,
the highly modified Porsche 9FF.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.440
From Italy, the Lamborghini.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.240
That's the LP640 version.

44:40.240 --> 44:45.359
From Japan, the Mitsubishi
Evo 10, that's the FD360.

44:45.359 --> 44:47.199
Yes, that's there's, now ours.

44:47.199 --> 44:50.240
From England and driven by
Wing Commander Bunny Hammond,

44:50.240 --> 44:52.920
is the Ariel Atom,
the supercharged version.

44:52.920 --> 44:58.559
Then from America, I was thinking
of you here, corporal, is the
Callaway Corvette, also supercharged.

44:58.559 --> 45:01.840
And like I was saying, you haven't
thought it through, have you?

45:01.840 --> 45:08.560
Let me guess, James, New Zealand
makes a V16 rocket car that somehow
we don't know about. They don't.

45:08.560 --> 45:14.000
However, India was on our side,
whilst I waited for one of their cars

45:14.000 --> 45:19.320
to turn up I sent the others
off to neuter the 250mph Porsche.

45:19.320 --> 45:30.239
And they decided it would
have trouble putting its 1000
horsepower down off the line.

45:30.239 --> 45:34.040
If the race is quarter of a mile
this is still gonna be sitting
here spinning its wheels. Yeah.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.720
Right, you're gonna love this.

45:35.720 --> 45:38.800
There are rules and regulations
- you like that sort of thing -

45:38.800 --> 45:42.280
concerning a drag race, and they
are always a quarter of a mile.

45:42.280 --> 45:47.720
No, no. We drive kilometres.
At least one kilometre.

45:47.720 --> 45:52.040
If you say a quarter of a mile
everybody knows what that is
because it's the standard measure.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.919
Half kilometre burger, please, no.

45:53.919 --> 45:57.720
It's a quarter pounder, you have
a quarter-mile drag race.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.879
It's the British way. Let's do it.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.680
With the 9FF hopefully out of it my
attention turned to the Lamborghini.

46:08.240 --> 46:13.079
What I'm hoping,
praying is that being Italian
it changes sides halfway down.

46:14.519 --> 46:18.400
As we got ready, James's Indian car
finally turned up.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.160
Supercharged. Supercharged.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.919
Charged.

46:34.919 --> 46:38.360
James, don't forget to turn
your traction control off, mate.

46:40.759 --> 46:45.239
Cock. I've just remembered the
Australians. They do that VXR thing.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.280
Lofty Hammond got a lightning start.

46:52.400 --> 46:52.520
Lofty Hammond got a lightning start.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.000
This is unbelievable acceleration!

47:00.760 --> 47:05.279
The atom in the Atom would clearly
win but who would come second?

47:05.279 --> 47:07.160
Come on! Come on!

47:10.280 --> 47:14.879
The Lambo's got me. But could I
hold off that monstrous Porsche?

47:17.480 --> 47:18.800
Yes!

47:22.079 --> 47:25.520
Yeah, that is ours! That is ours!

47:29.320 --> 47:33.479
So...how do you feel now?

47:36.880 --> 47:42.239
So we were first. Let's just say
that again, make it clear - first.

47:42.239 --> 47:45.880
First. Third.
First. And last.

47:45.880 --> 47:50.480
Well, you say last. There's
a symmetry to that - we had first

47:50.480 --> 47:56.039
and last, the two most significant
places in the drag race are owned
by us. We own the whole territory.

47:56.039 --> 48:01.640
You won the double deckers,
we've got some points back.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.199
The drag race marks
the end of the team challenges.

48:04.199 --> 48:07.079
From now on, it would be one-on-one.

48:10.399 --> 48:15.359
For this event Germany will be
represented by ring mistress,
racing driver, Sabine Schmitz.

48:15.359 --> 48:18.520
We will be represented by that.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.840
Anyway, the cars - each team must
bring something small, reasonably
priced and from their own country.

48:25.840 --> 48:29.200
So we've come up with this -
it's a Mini Cooper S.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.679
Sabine, what have you got?

48:31.679 --> 48:33.880
I've got that car. What, the Golf?

48:33.880 --> 48:36.639
No, the Mini Cooper, of course!

48:36.639 --> 48:39.160
Weren't you listening? It's German.
We said it's from your own country.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.759
It's a Mini.

48:41.759 --> 48:45.880
You can't get more
British than a Mini!

48:45.880 --> 48:50.559
Alec Issigonis, how much more
of a British name is there
than Issigonis?

48:50.559 --> 48:53.960
Apart from Patel?
British, British, British!

48:53.960 --> 48:56.879
OK, so we're in the same cars.
Just let them do it.

48:56.879 --> 49:03.119
So the International Small Car
Challenge, and it goes like this...

49:05.880 --> 49:09.959
Slalom through the Ming vases.
Steering is so easy.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.999
Reverse into the garage
of priceless crockery.

49:14.999 --> 49:20.920
Then take a J turn penalty which,
amazingly, the German missed.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.679
Next, drive a figure of eight
while a member of

49:25.679 --> 49:28.679
the other team shoots at you

49:28.679 --> 49:31.919
from a paintball tank. One point
off for each hit, escape the arena

49:31.919 --> 49:35.080
through a tunnel we shall call Dick.

49:38.279 --> 49:41.999
But then it was Jeremy's turn.
Gut luck.

49:41.999 --> 49:44.319
Here we go!

49:47.199 --> 49:50.360
So far not one hit!

49:52.640 --> 49:54.599
That's the ticket.

49:56.200 --> 49:59.360
Still, things could only get better.

50:01.719 --> 50:03.680
Oh! I've scored.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.079
I only had the figure of eight
to redeem myself.

50:07.079 --> 50:08.600
Come on, handbrake.

50:08.600 --> 50:09.719
Fire!

50:11.919 --> 50:12.959
Fire!

50:12.959 --> 50:17.680
An awful lot of bullets hitting me
here. And no wonder.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.999
James! What are you doing?
Shooting at Jeremy.

50:20.999 --> 50:24.639
Well, he's on our side!
Yeah, but why wouldn't you?
You're right! You would! Fire!

50:29.600 --> 50:30.960
Come on, through Dick!

50:32.360 --> 50:36.479
Yes. Even that went wrong.

50:38.959 --> 50:41.879
So, I was trailing on points.

50:41.879 --> 50:46.319
But I could win some back in
the final part of the challenge,
the head to head one

50:46.319 --> 50:53.000
lap race around the Zolder circuit,
the winner would be the first one
to get their towel on the sunbed.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.360
A date with destiny.

51:00.040 --> 51:01.960
She's ahead by what
she'd call a metre.

51:04.559 --> 51:05.840
Woo!

51:11.879 --> 51:14.999
She's breaking early there, I'm not

51:14.999 --> 51:17.800
going to do that.
I dive down inside.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.199
I'm in the lead!

51:20.199 --> 51:22.120
I'm not in the lead!

51:30.760 --> 51:35.079
The TV idiot was trying
everything to get past.

51:44.920 --> 51:50.440
Come on! Jeremy!
This really was a proper race.

51:51.599 --> 51:53.600
I'm not talking, this matters.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.800
Jeremy, let him get something right.

52:08.879 --> 52:10.919
No! No! No!

52:10.919 --> 52:14.079
They've got to get up to the bridge.

52:19.239 --> 52:23.679
There's no possibility, in this
environment, of beating a German.

52:23.679 --> 52:25.439
That was feeble.
And then you didn't...

52:25.439 --> 52:29.439
Sorry. Were you shooting at me? In
that tank? He was, yes, he did that.

52:31.039 --> 52:35.440
After that debacle,
we were trailing by nine points.

52:38.719 --> 52:44.080
But I was handling the next
challenge. And it was to be
a shoot-out in my kind of car.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.719
The incredible Bowler Nemesis.

52:46.719 --> 52:51.039
4.4 litre V8, 300 brake horse
power, 0 to 60 in six seconds.

52:51.039 --> 52:53.639
Top speed 130 miles an hour.

52:53.639 --> 52:57.640
But, as always, with a Bowler,
it can do that anywhere on anything.

52:57.640 --> 53:01.640
And better still,
my opponent would be the accountant.

53:01.640 --> 53:04.240
Driven a Bowler before? No. Good.

53:04.240 --> 53:07.319
Good. Well, they're terrifying.

53:07.319 --> 53:11.080
Does he not do any racing?
No, never, he hasn't got a car.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.319
No. He has a licence, that's it.

53:13.319 --> 53:18.399
One driver dislodged
his lung when he went too fast.

53:18.399 --> 53:20.720
But you'll be fine,
you'll enjoy this. Good luck.

53:20.720 --> 53:28.079
It would be a five lap race over
a track that was 60% Tarmac and,
thanks to James, 60% gravel.

53:40.079 --> 53:42.119
We are off. Come on, mighty Bowler.

53:48.200 --> 53:54.040
On Tarmac, the accountant kept up,
but once we hit the dirt,
he wouldn't see me for dust.

53:55.799 --> 53:58.760
Yes! More like it!

53:58.760 --> 54:01.080
Meanwhile, back at base...

54:01.080 --> 54:03.560
Sit down.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.479
You're not
interested in these, are you?

54:06.479 --> 54:12.560
Do you know what? Your mind cannot
comprehend of how uninterested
I am in things like this.

54:16.599 --> 54:19.640
Back on track,
Hammond couldn't shake
the man in the suit off his tail.

54:19.640 --> 54:22.840
He was clearly a worthy adversary.

54:24.159 --> 54:26.000
Keep your foot in Hammond, be brave.

54:32.519 --> 54:35.999
A point Hammond
proved, moments later.

54:42.960 --> 54:44.959
HE LAUGHS

54:46.799 --> 54:51.800
If you don't get that going,
Hammond, for us,
ze competition is over!

54:51.800 --> 54:53.360
That didn't go well, then.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.080
This was a race we had to win.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.199
But the VAT man had a big lead.

54:59.199 --> 55:01.760
I'm going to get grief
for this, now, this is not good.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.440
Cooler! Eight weeks!

55:08.119 --> 55:09.759
Where's the track gone?

55:12.880 --> 55:14.560
Is he gaining? He is gaining.

55:31.640 --> 55:35.600
On the last corner, I decided
to take him on the outside.

55:35.600 --> 55:38.079
I can have him here!

55:42.599 --> 55:44.319
Yes!

55:45.040 --> 55:46.999
Yeah!

55:46.999 --> 55:49.239
Well done, then. Thank you!

55:49.239 --> 55:54.320
You know what a bad loser is?
Well, Hammond is what's called
a bad winner.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.039
YES!

55:58.640 --> 56:00.599
What do you think of that?

56:02.759 --> 56:05.600
Congratulate me, then, I've won.
Did you notice, I was first?

56:05.600 --> 56:11.359
After Hammond's modest win, we
were trailing by just four points

56:11.359 --> 56:14.200
as we went into the last event.

56:14.200 --> 56:17.600
It's a two-lap race
of the Zolder circuit.

56:17.600 --> 56:22.400
It's between a Porsche 911, a racing
Porsche 911, which will be driven by

56:22.400 --> 56:24.880
professional racing driver,
Tim Schrick.

56:24.880 --> 56:32.360
And he will be against
an Aston Martin DBRS9,
which will be driven by James May.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.360
Do we have to use James?

56:35.360 --> 56:37.599
Well, no, you did the Bowler thing,
I did the Mini thing, it's his turn.

56:37.599 --> 56:39.880
But, he's going to lose, badly.

56:39.880 --> 56:44.600
Happily, though,
I'd come up with a plan.

56:44.600 --> 56:48.200
You know what I mean?
Clever. Very clever.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.159
It's James. It's James, yeah,
he's come in for the race. He
always...always dresses like this.

56:56.159 --> 56:59.399
But what is this?

56:59.399 --> 57:02.160
He always dresses like this when
he drives a racing car. Good luck.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.760
Who cut his hair?

57:04.760 --> 57:06.479
He's lost it.

57:06.479 --> 57:09.719
Don't disturb him when he's focused
and in his zone, ready for a race.

57:09.719 --> 57:13.319
He's ice-cool. Well, this could work.

57:13.319 --> 57:15.999
Could do. There's every chance.

57:15.999 --> 57:18.239
It would be a rolling start.

57:18.239 --> 57:22.399
Because we were four points behind,
James, who's warming his tyres up,

57:22.399 --> 57:26.440
had to set off four seconds
after the Porsche.

57:31.959 --> 57:33.919
The race was on.

57:35.519 --> 57:38.440
Go, James! Go!

57:45.560 --> 57:48.520
The simple fact of the matter
is this, our young man had to shoot

57:48.520 --> 57:54.440
down their young man
at the rate of two seconds a lap.

58:06.359 --> 58:09.559
If he does full throttle on
the straight, it's not kept slow.

58:09.559 --> 58:15.000
I know...
That's his nickname, you know?

58:15.000 --> 58:16.880
We call him Lofty.
It's the opposite.

58:19.400 --> 58:24.719
Towards the end of the first lap,
James had closed the gap
to just one second.

58:36.959 --> 58:41.200
James was driving brilliantly
but then disaster.

58:41.200 --> 58:46.879
He locked up, he lost ground, he had
the work to do all over again.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.119
Happily, James is no quitter.

58:53.119 --> 58:57.560
With half a lap to go, he was
right back under the Porsche's wing.

59:04.240 --> 59:07.960
With just two corners to go,
he made his move.

59:09.920 --> 59:13.199
I don't want to see! I can
hear them, I can hear them both!

59:13.199 --> 59:15.959
Which car would appear first?

59:15.959 --> 59:19.280
Which one?

59:20.759 --> 59:22.559
It's there!

59:22.559 --> 59:24.040
Stig! James!

59:24.040 --> 59:27.000
CHEERING

59:32.560 --> 59:35.000
James.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.559
James.

59:38.559 --> 59:41.520
Some say, you saved our bacon.

59:41.520 --> 59:44.319
Others say I was bound
and gagged in the locker room.

59:44.319 --> 59:45.919
LAUGHTER

59:45.919 --> 59:49.679
And on that bouncing bomb shell,
it's now time to end.

59:49.679 --> 59:56.319

any complaints about the film you've
seen, do feel free to write to us.

59:56.319 --> 01:00:00.119
