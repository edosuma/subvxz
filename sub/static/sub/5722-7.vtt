00:06.263 --> 00:07.976

00:08.010 --> 00:11.299
Are you American? Huh? A spy?

00:11.367 --> 00:13.669
- You were in Syria?
- Till 20 days ago.

00:13.737 --> 00:16.938
- What were you doing there?
- Protecting Yaseer Ramali's trucks.

00:17.006 --> 00:18.873
A mercenary.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.343
I got a call
from Vasily on the tarmac,

00:21.411 --> 00:24.646
except it wasn't Vasily
on the other end of the line.

00:24.713 --> 00:27.349
I have to assume
it was Saul Berenson's hit man.

00:27.417 --> 00:28.950
Exactly.

00:29.018 --> 00:31.019
And what happens
when he and Saul compare notes

00:31.087 --> 00:32.686
and realize that it was me

00:32.755 --> 00:34.789
who put Carrie Mathison's name
in that kill box?

00:34.857 --> 00:36.858
Saul's weakness is Israel.

00:36.926 --> 00:38.527
Dar Adal knows it.

00:38.594 --> 00:40.962
I know what this is about.
You think I don't?

00:41.030 --> 00:42.964
30 years ago, I leaked
three names to Mossad.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.866
Three terrorist names
during a desperate time.

00:44.934 --> 00:47.735
You hang onto it
like it was yesterday.

00:47.803 --> 00:49.538
Your operation-- Quinn
taking out jihadis--

00:49.605 --> 00:52.540
someone got inside it, put
my name there as a target.

00:52.608 --> 00:53.862
It was the Russians.

00:53.863 --> 00:55.076
Want to tell me
why the Russians give a shit

00:55.077 --> 00:56.444
whether you're alive or dead?

00:56.511 --> 00:58.345
Because they don't want me
to see something

00:58.413 --> 01:00.181
in the documents
those hackers stole from you.

01:00.248 --> 01:03.150
So what is it-- this thing
they don't want you to see?

01:03.218 --> 01:05.553
I don't know.

01:05.621 --> 01:08.623
Which is why you need
to get the documents for me.

01:10.448 --> 01:11.459
_

01:11.460 --> 01:13.628
Oh, shit.

01:13.696 --> 01:16.464
Sweep all of it, down to
the bone, starting in the back.

01:16.531 --> 01:18.132
Wait, they were already
in here yesterday.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.067
- Langley wants a second pass.
- This is ridiculous.

01:20.134 --> 01:22.168
Hey, hey, hey, hey, careful!
Don't pull that!

01:22.236 --> 01:25.371
You can't bend fiber optic cable
like garden hose, okay?

<i>Where's Saul?</i>

01:30.612 --> 01:33.446
He left the office with a copy
of the breach documents.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.381
I want to talk to you
about Carrie Mathison.

01:35.449 --> 01:37.751
Carrie came to me for help,
asked me to bring her

01:37.819 --> 01:39.686
some classified files,
I refused.

01:39.754 --> 01:41.722
I didn't trust her, because
of you, for one thing.

01:41.789 --> 01:43.356
Anyway, I didn't
believe her. Now I do.

01:43.424 --> 01:46.126
I need you to give
her something for me.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.294
Herr Düring, these men
won't identify themselves.

01:48.362 --> 01:50.263
We're investigating
a terrorist act. Sit down.

01:50.331 --> 01:53.032
- Did he give you anything?
- He didn't give me anything.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.900
Take him out of here.

01:54.968 --> 01:57.103
From Saul Berenson.

01:57.171 --> 02:00.273
He said you'd know
what to do with it.

I was wrong.

So...

04:24.481 --> 04:26.515
what gifts have you
brought me this evening?

04:26.583 --> 04:28.450
None.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.353
I specifically asked for details

04:31.420 --> 04:33.421
on NATO's air exercise
in the Baltic.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.323
Impossible.

I don't think so, Ivan.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.436
What is it?

04:52.609 --> 04:54.943
Saul Berenson

04:55.011 --> 04:57.412
smuggled a thumb drive
out of the building,

04:57.480 --> 05:00.382
and then met
with Otto Düring at his club.

05:00.449 --> 05:01.983
What was on the thumb drive?

05:02.051 --> 05:05.086
Our famous 1,361 files.
What else?

05:09.625 --> 05:11.993
Why on earth?

05:12.061 --> 05:14.362
I have no idea.

05:14.430 --> 05:18.699
I've been racking my brains
trying to figure it out.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.135
That doesn't make sense.

05:20.202 --> 05:21.736
He despises Düring.

05:23.139 --> 05:25.140
There's only one person

05:25.207 --> 05:28.208
Saul would go so far out
on a limb for.

05:28.276 --> 05:31.111
Allison, she's dead.

05:32.268 --> 05:34.948
What if she's not?

05:35.016 --> 05:37.451
You saw it for yourself.

05:37.519 --> 05:40.120
I saw a photo, not a body.

05:40.188 --> 05:42.556
Did you see a body?

05:42.623 --> 05:45.292
She works for Düring.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.594
What if she's going through
the documents right now?

05:47.662 --> 05:49.263
What then?

05:49.330 --> 05:51.398
You're projecting
your anxieties, okay?

05:51.466 --> 05:53.434
Imagining the worst.

05:53.501 --> 05:57.003
I will not spend the rest
of my life in prison.

05:59.507 --> 06:01.775
(sighs)

06:01.842 --> 06:04.211
Okay.

06:04.279 --> 06:05.812
Okay, fine.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.081
Let's say you're right.

06:08.148 --> 06:13.386
I highly doubt it, but
even if you are right,

06:13.454 --> 06:15.321
it's a long way
from here to there.

06:15.389 --> 06:16.922
(sighs)

06:16.990 --> 06:19.292
We'll have
to establish the facts first.

06:19.359 --> 06:22.261
(sighs)

06:22.329 --> 06:24.630
Talk to Saul.

06:24.698 --> 06:27.666
How? He's under 24-hour guard,
getting grilled by Dar Adal.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.102
So?

06:29.169 --> 06:30.703
It's not the Lubyanka.

06:30.770 --> 06:34.039
Find an opportunity,
or create one.

Ali, Alichka,

06:41.714 --> 06:44.549
no one does it better than you.

06:44.617 --> 06:46.851
You've played these
men for years.

06:46.919 --> 06:48.953
They trust you.

06:49.021 --> 06:51.123

06:52.525 --> 06:54.993

Hey.

07:31.697 --> 07:33.597
Otto, what are you still
doing up?

07:33.666 --> 07:35.499
Sleep is overrated.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.702
I thought
you could use some coffee.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.570
Oh, thank you.

07:39.638 --> 07:42.907
Anything?

07:42.975 --> 07:45.509
Not yet. I'm about a quarter
of the way through them.

07:45.577 --> 07:48.046
Well... I'll leave you to it.

07:48.113 --> 07:49.881
No, I could use a break.

07:49.948 --> 07:51.615
I can... I can
barely see straight.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.717
(sighs)

07:53.785 --> 07:55.786
Milk? Sugar?

07:55.853 --> 07:58.222
Black is fine.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.858
Your house is amazing. Your...

08:01.926 --> 08:03.994
<i>Schloss.</i>

08:04.062 --> 08:05.529
Thank you.

08:05.597 --> 08:08.499
So, what are you looking for
exactly?

08:08.567 --> 08:11.402
I don't know... exactly.

08:13.672 --> 08:16.407
Something Russian intelligence
doesn't want me to see.

08:18.343 --> 08:21.612
Something they're
willing to kill you for.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.281
Right.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.350
You know, I'm half hoping

08:27.418 --> 08:29.886
I don't find anything at all.

08:29.954 --> 08:31.387
Why is that?

08:31.455 --> 08:34.591
Then this can all
still be a mistake,

08:34.658 --> 08:38.195
some... big misunderstanding.

08:40.164 --> 08:42.498
Wouldn't that be nice?

08:42.566 --> 08:45.435
And what would you do then?

08:48.039 --> 08:50.406
I'd go get Jonas,

08:50.474 --> 08:52.609
fly home to DC,

08:52.676 --> 08:54.644
take him and Franny
to this cabin

08:54.712 --> 08:58.414
my sister and I have by a lake.

08:58.482 --> 09:01.084
And never leave.

09:01.152 --> 09:03.053
Well, that would be nice.

09:07.357 --> 09:12.494
Actually, I doubt
he'd even come with me.

09:12.562 --> 09:15.064
Things got pretty crazy there
for a while.

09:18.334 --> 09:20.636
We broke up.

09:20.703 --> 09:25.074
I'm very sorry to hear that.

09:25.142 --> 09:29.678
You know, Jonas is my
friend and he's a good man,

09:29.746 --> 09:31.313
but...

09:31.381 --> 09:34.183
What?

09:34.251 --> 09:36.152
He-he's a lawyer.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.654
Keeps both feet on the ground.

09:38.721 --> 09:43.292
Yeah, he does. That's one
of the things I love about him.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.260
My first wife was like that.

09:45.328 --> 09:47.195
Earthbound.

09:47.263 --> 09:49.230
Earthbound, huh?

09:49.299 --> 09:51.366
Most people are.

You just gonna keep him
in there indefinitely?

10:29.771 --> 10:31.905
He's being completely
uncooperative.

10:31.973 --> 10:34.408
- What's he saying?
- Ah.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.776
It's all too stupid
and theatrical for words.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.646
Is he still denying he took the
thumb drive from the building?

10:39.714 --> 10:42.615
Of course he is.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.887
Well, maybe he's telling
the truth, after all.

10:46.955 --> 10:50.123
What's this?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.558
I found it in my desk.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.093
Where he camped out
most of yesterday.

10:53.161 --> 10:55.362
Oh, come on.

10:55.429 --> 10:58.598
You don't expect me
to buy that, do you?

10:58.666 --> 11:01.201
Not really.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.570
But there it was
just the same.

11:03.637 --> 11:06.239
Sitting in the top drawer.

11:06.306 --> 11:09.041
It's got all the files
on it, too. I checked.

11:09.109 --> 11:12.579
Nice try, Allison.

11:12.646 --> 11:15.114
Just because I'm sleeping
with him doesn't mean

11:15.182 --> 11:17.484
I'd perjure myself
to protect him.

11:17.551 --> 11:21.721
It's a fair point.

11:21.789 --> 11:23.590
Doesn't mean he didn't
make a second copy

11:23.657 --> 11:25.091
and give that one to Düring.

11:26.527 --> 11:29.829
Also a good point.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.832
How about letting me
take a run at him then?

11:32.900 --> 11:35.334
Come on, what have
we got to lose?

11:35.403 --> 11:39.338
If he's gonna talk to anyone,
it's gonna be me.

11:41.909 --> 11:45.044
- Fine. Have at him.
- Not here.

11:45.112 --> 11:48.680
We all know enough not to
incriminate ourselves on camera.

11:48.748 --> 11:50.616
Where then?

11:50.683 --> 11:53.052
Let me take him
back to the hotel.

13:03.153 --> 13:06.600
_

13:06.991 --> 13:09.225
Hello?

13:09.293 --> 13:11.561
Samir is not here.

13:11.629 --> 13:13.730
This isn't Dunya, is it?

13:13.798 --> 13:15.331
No.

13:15.399 --> 13:17.400
You're Shatha, then.

13:17.468 --> 13:19.435
Yes.

13:19.504 --> 13:22.571
Shatha, my name is Carrie Orser.

13:22.639 --> 13:24.339
I knew your father many years
ago-- we worked together

13:24.407 --> 13:26.675
trying to rebuild
the justice sector in Iraq.

13:26.743 --> 13:28.944
It's really important
that I speak with him.

13:29.012 --> 13:30.713
He's not here.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.047
But this is his number, right?

13:40.023 --> 13:41.590
(exhales)

13:55.171 --> 13:57.105
I've spoken with
the brothers.

13:57.173 --> 13:58.806
They all agree.

13:58.874 --> 14:00.308
About what?

14:00.376 --> 14:01.876
No attack here in Berlin.

14:01.944 --> 14:04.212
We go to the Levant
to fight instead.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.417
Honestly, I don't give a shit
what you do.

14:08.484 --> 14:10.352
But it was your recommendation.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.288
Not that I remember.

14:14.524 --> 14:16.958
Will you help us get to Turkey?

14:17.026 --> 14:18.325
No.

14:18.393 --> 14:20.161
Come on. You've taken
the trip before.

14:20.228 --> 14:21.996
You could show us
the best way.

14:22.064 --> 14:23.765
I said no.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.435
We could pay you.
Not enough.

14:27.502 --> 14:29.637
- What's enough?
- $10,000 a week.

14:29.705 --> 14:31.405
Dollars, US.

14:31.473 --> 14:33.407
My uncle could pay you.

14:33.475 --> 14:36.343
He's an important man.

14:36.411 --> 14:38.112
How important?

14:38.180 --> 14:41.182
He's in charge of collecting
ransoms in Northern Syria.

14:41.249 --> 14:42.483
He's an emir?

14:42.551 --> 14:43.784
Deputy emir.

14:43.851 --> 14:44.952
What's his name?

14:46.621 --> 14:48.489
Abu al-Qaduli.

14:50.358 --> 14:52.193
Never heard of him.

14:53.628 --> 14:54.995
You choose.

14:55.063 --> 14:56.564
Come with us,

14:56.631 --> 14:57.998
make a lot of money.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.467
Stay here...

14:59.534 --> 15:02.136
wait for Hajik's brothers
to find you and kill you.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.575
We go tonight.

15:09.844 --> 15:12.512
(bird cawing in distance)

15:12.580 --> 15:14.147
He's inside there.

15:14.215 --> 15:15.849
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:28.462 --> 15:29.997
Hello.

15:30.064 --> 15:33.366
And good morning.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.901
It's beautiful, isn't it?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.371
Very.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.640
Come sit with me.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.479
It's a miracle.

15:46.547 --> 15:50.983
God knows how it
survived the war.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.320
The Red Army came charging
through here in '45.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.793
Later, when I was
growing up...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.864
my mother hired a monk
to come live with us

16:05.931 --> 16:08.667
and say Mass.

16:08.734 --> 16:12.571
Father Leibniz.
Very strict.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.374
I've always found it difficult
being a Catholic.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.675
You?

16:18.744 --> 16:21.180
I don't know.
I was lapsed so long,

16:21.247 --> 16:23.415
maybe I missed the hard part.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.916
(sighs)

16:24.984 --> 16:26.718
Who was it who
used to pray,

16:26.786 --> 16:29.054
"Oh, Lord,
make me good...

16:29.121 --> 16:31.056
but not yet"?

16:31.123 --> 16:32.590
(laughs)

16:34.526 --> 16:36.895
You seem pretty
virtuous to me.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.297
Oh, but I'm not.

16:39.364 --> 16:41.066
I'm not.

16:42.434 --> 16:45.937
(sighs)

16:46.005 --> 16:48.406
Listen, Otto, would you mind
if I asked Laura Sutton

16:48.473 --> 16:50.274
to join us here
for a while,

16:50.342 --> 16:52.443
help me track down
someone on the Internet?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.145
You've found something?

16:54.213 --> 16:56.247
I think so.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.217
By all means, then, yes.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.752
(phone buzzing)

17:00.820 --> 17:02.087
Excuse me.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.693
Hello?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.361
Carrie. Darling.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.029
My little Oriole.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.464
How are you, Samir?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.266
- Are you well?
- Okay.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.634
Just okay?

17:16.702 --> 17:19.369
Well, I have the misfortune
to suffer in my back.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.271
It's all those years
sitting on the bench.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.740
All those years

17:22.807 --> 17:24.906
in Saddam's prison.

17:24.974 --> 17:29.979
Anyway, I haven't been anywhere
near the courtroom since 2009.

17:30.047 --> 17:31.414
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.649
Don't be.

17:32.717 --> 17:34.451
The rule of law
is finished here.

17:36.687 --> 17:38.087
(sighs)

17:38.155 --> 17:40.757
Five months ago,
you tried to contact me, Samir.

17:40.824 --> 17:42.091
Yes.

17:42.159 --> 17:45.695
I put up a distress rocket
but heard nothing back.

17:45.763 --> 17:47.463
- Nothing?
- Well, not really nothing.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.832
I had a crash visit
from some comedian

17:49.900 --> 17:52.268
called Smith or Jones.

17:52.335 --> 17:54.269
And what did you tell him?

17:54.336 --> 17:56.437
That I would only talk to <i>you.</i>

17:56.505 --> 17:58.273
I wanted <i>you,</i> Carrie.

17:58.340 --> 18:01.209
But from you I heard nothing,
not a word.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.648
Oriole was on the shelf, Samir.
(chuckles softly)

18:06.715 --> 18:09.617
Oriole had flown the coop.

18:09.685 --> 18:12.120
Somebody might have told me,
don't you think?

18:12.188 --> 18:16.623
Instead, I'm sitting here and
waiting for the phone to ring.

18:16.691 --> 18:18.993
What did you want to tell me?

18:19.060 --> 18:21.929
Remember the name Ahmed Nazari,
by any chance?

18:21.997 --> 18:24.331
Yeah, of course--
the... the lawyer.

18:24.399 --> 18:26.200
The Creep of the Year,

18:26.268 --> 18:29.837
fabricator, the bribe taker
and intelligence peddler.

18:29.905 --> 18:31.505
He died, as I remember.

18:31.572 --> 18:33.874
In the bombing
at the Ministry of Justice.

18:33.942 --> 18:35.609
No.

18:35.677 --> 18:38.378
Oh, he did, Samir.
I'm fairly certain.

18:38.446 --> 18:40.579
Well, then he's risen
from the dead.

18:40.647 --> 18:42.648
What do you mean?

18:42.716 --> 18:44.650
Why I put up the rocket.

18:44.718 --> 18:48.188
I saw him one morning
walking the neighborhood.

18:48.255 --> 18:50.523
I'd heard his father
had been ill.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.826
You sure it was him?

18:52.893 --> 18:55.929
Up so close
I could smell his cologne.

18:58.799 --> 19:01.534
ADAL: Imagine my surprise
learning you were here in Berlin.

19:01.601 --> 19:03.101
I assumed you knew.

19:03.169 --> 19:04.636
I didn't.

19:04.704 --> 19:07.372
You and Saul--
the perfect marriage ending badly.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.210
Hmm. Did he ever mention
Otto Düring to you,

19:11.277 --> 19:12.811
or the Foundation?

19:12.879 --> 19:14.146
Never.

19:14.214 --> 19:16.381
What about the Israelis,
some kind of joint operation

19:16.449 --> 19:17.850
he was running with them?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.151
No. Could we sit?

19:19.219 --> 19:20.919
Yeah.

19:23.223 --> 19:25.223
I brought you a sandwich.

19:27.993 --> 19:29.493
Thanks.

19:31.096 --> 19:32.563
You said you
caught a break?

19:32.630 --> 19:35.432
Yeah, I did.
Got lucky, I guess.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.034
How so?

19:37.102 --> 19:39.904
Fell in with some of the jihadis
released the other night

19:39.972 --> 19:41.372
from Plötzensee Prison.

19:41.439 --> 19:43.540
- Yeah?
- Long story.

19:43.608 --> 19:46.978
Bottom line, they want
an escort to the Syrian border.

19:47.045 --> 19:49.046
That's interesting.

19:49.114 --> 19:52.415
- Why?
- Signals Intelligence picked up indications

19:52.483 --> 19:54.918
they were planning
something here in Berlin.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.586
Something big.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.556
They were. Now they're gonna die
like dogs in the desert.

20:03.394 --> 20:05.328
Impressive, Peter.

20:05.396 --> 20:06.997
Well done.

20:07.064 --> 20:09.232
There's more.
One of them has an uncle.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.500
Guess who.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.135
I hate guessing.

20:12.203 --> 20:13.603
Al-Qaduli.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.805
You're kidding.

20:15.873 --> 20:17.673
It might present us with
a paint-and-kill opportunity.

20:17.741 --> 20:20.175
I get close enough, you have
the ordinance standing by.

20:24.114 --> 20:26.181
Sounds like a plan.

20:32.188 --> 20:33.489
Yes, I'm a traitor.

20:33.557 --> 20:35.625
Yes, I'm here to plant
disinformation on you

20:35.692 --> 20:37.693
in service of the great
state of Israel.

20:37.761 --> 20:39.829
Yes, Otto Düring
is my accomplice.

20:39.897 --> 20:41.297
Take me, hang me.

20:41.364 --> 20:43.332
- Anything but this.
- Let me make you a drink.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.699
I don't want a drink.

20:44.767 --> 20:46.701
The sheer fucking
insanity of it.

20:46.769 --> 20:48.870
- That's a little harsh.
- Harsh? How?

20:48.939 --> 20:51.873
Even I'm convinced you took the
thumb drive out of the building.

20:51.942 --> 20:53.775
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:53.843 --> 20:55.911
I just can't figure out why.

20:55.979 --> 20:59.048
- Well, how come you covered for me, then?
- I'm loyal.

20:59.115 --> 21:01.850
Well... most of the time,
anyway.

21:01.918 --> 21:04.853
Well, then buy me
the 72 hours I need.

21:04.921 --> 21:07.021
Beg if you have to.

21:07.089 --> 21:08.556
You think I haven't tried?

21:08.623 --> 21:11.960
Any idea what happens
if I'm shipped back to Langley?

21:12.027 --> 21:14.295
I've got a pretty
good idea, yeah.

21:14.363 --> 21:16.564
I'm not talking
short-term.

21:16.631 --> 21:19.200
I'm talking the long-term
purgatory of it.

21:19.268 --> 21:22.903
The suspicion
that never goes away.

21:22.972 --> 21:26.907
The latest unperson
in the latest looming scandal.

21:26.976 --> 21:29.377
Well, what difference
is 72 hours gonna make?

21:29.445 --> 21:32.546
I'll either have the answer
by then or I won't.

21:32.614 --> 21:35.516
I don't understand.

21:35.584 --> 21:38.051
What exactly is it
you're waiting for?

21:44.960 --> 21:47.628
Allison, tell the truth.

21:47.696 --> 21:49.363
We alone right now?

21:49.430 --> 21:51.365
As far as I know.

21:51.432 --> 21:53.200
No hidden microphones?

21:53.267 --> 21:54.902
No listeners
in the next room

21:54.970 --> 21:56.570
waving their magic
listening wands?

21:56.638 --> 21:59.539
Not that I'm aware of, no.

21:59.607 --> 22:02.274
(whispers):
Well, fuck it if they are.

22:05.513 --> 22:09.081
(dramatic piano concerto
playing loudly)

22:09.149 --> 22:10.750
Hear that?

22:10.818 --> 22:12.351
♪

22:12.419 --> 22:14.387
Rachmaninoff.

22:14.454 --> 22:16.623
Fuck you!

22:16.690 --> 22:17.624
♪

22:20.460 --> 22:23.396
(turns on faucets)

22:23.463 --> 22:25.564
(quietly):
I did download the documents.

22:25.632 --> 22:27.799
I did pass them
to Otto Düring.

22:29.002 --> 22:30.936
Saul. Why?

22:31.004 --> 22:32.438
Why?

22:32.506 --> 22:34.340
(concerto continues in distance)

22:34.408 --> 22:36.909
That's a good question.

22:36.976 --> 22:39.111
I'm loyal, too, I guess.

22:39.179 --> 22:40.913
Loyal to who?

22:40.980 --> 22:41.980
Carrie.

22:42.049 --> 22:44.016
Carrie.

22:44.084 --> 22:46.451
She believes her
life is in danger.

22:46.519 --> 22:48.486
I'm starting to
agree with her.

22:48.554 --> 22:50.688
She thinks the reason's
in the documents somewhere.

22:50.756 --> 22:52.690
- So she has them now?
- I'm assuming.

22:52.758 --> 22:55.927
- I took them to Düring to take to her.
- I see.

22:55.994 --> 22:58.530
She's the one
I'm waiting to hear back from.

22:58.597 --> 23:00.465
(faucets continue running)

23:02.435 --> 23:03.868
Saul...

23:03.936 --> 23:07.072
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

23:08.307 --> 23:09.607
(exhales)

23:09.675 --> 23:11.008
You all right?

23:11.076 --> 23:12.476
What is it?

23:12.544 --> 23:14.978
I'm not sure.

23:15.046 --> 23:16.947
Should I call somebody?

23:17.014 --> 23:19.116
No. No. I'll be fine.

23:19.184 --> 23:20.650
(exhales)

23:23.488 --> 23:25.322
Need a minute?

23:25.390 --> 23:27.458
Yeah. A minute. Thanks.

23:31.229 --> 23:33.163
(door closes)

23:34.999 --> 23:36.933
(music stops)

23:37.001 --> 23:39.168

23:39.236 --> 23:41.504
(panting grows rapid)

23:46.077 --> 23:48.645

25:16.798 --> 25:19.667
- Hey.
LAURA: - Hey.

25:22.837 --> 25:27.240
Carrie, this is Numan,
aka Gabe H. Coud.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.609
Numan, this is
Carrie Mathison.

25:29.677 --> 25:31.110
Laura said
she might be bringing you.

25:31.178 --> 25:32.545
I could really use your help.

25:32.613 --> 25:34.080
Thanks for coming.

25:34.147 --> 25:35.715
I want to know
what I'm helping you with first.

25:35.782 --> 25:36.982
We both do.

25:37.050 --> 25:38.818
- Of course.
- After,

25:38.885 --> 25:40.620
maybe then you could
help me.

25:40.688 --> 25:42.922
Anything you need.

25:42.989 --> 25:45.458
To find my friend Korzenik.

25:49.530 --> 25:50.996
What is it?

25:52.199 --> 25:54.600
He's dead, Numan.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.435
What?

25:58.038 --> 26:00.472
How do you know
this?

26:00.540 --> 26:02.474
(sighs)

26:02.542 --> 26:04.810
The SVR is now in possession
of the documents

26:04.878 --> 26:06.879
you hacked out
of Berlin Station.

26:06.947 --> 26:08.881
They killed Katja
Keller getting them.

26:08.949 --> 26:12.718
Korzenik is a loose end they
would never leave untied.

26:12.786 --> 26:15.054
I'm sorry.

26:18.024 --> 26:19.391
What I'm asking is, you help me

26:19.459 --> 26:22.762
identify the people responsible
for his murder.

26:23.964 --> 26:26.164
Will you?

26:30.836 --> 26:33.605
Okay. The first thing
we need to do is locate

26:33.673 --> 26:35.340
this man.

26:35.408 --> 26:37.643
Ahmed Nazari.

26:42.248 --> 26:44.182
This is an obituary.

26:44.250 --> 26:47.618
Well, apparently his death
was greatly exaggerated.

26:47.686 --> 26:49.119
He was a lawyer in Baghdad,

26:49.187 --> 26:50.854
attached
to the Ministry of Justice.

26:50.922 --> 26:55.493
As well as an asset of
the Central Intelligence Agency.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.727
Really?

26:56.795 --> 26:58.362
The plot thickens.

26:58.430 --> 27:00.464
Are you saying they
intentionally disappeared him?

27:00.532 --> 27:03.167
Who? The CIA? I-I don't know.

27:03.234 --> 27:06.337
- Where should we start looking?
- Ahmed's wife left Iraq nine months

27:06.405 --> 27:08.839
after the bombing that
supposedly killed her husband.

27:08.907 --> 27:11.041
As far as I know,
she went to Amman, Jordan.

27:11.109 --> 27:13.110
- What was her name?
- Jamila.

27:13.178 --> 27:14.345
Jamila Nazari.

27:14.413 --> 27:16.546
So I'm assuming
this means

27:16.614 --> 27:18.548
you got ahold
of the documents after all.

27:19.750 --> 27:21.551
I did.

27:21.619 --> 27:22.820
Are they here?

27:22.887 --> 27:24.788
In this room? Let me see 'em.

27:26.191 --> 27:28.625
- Laura, I can't.
- Come on, Carrie.

27:28.693 --> 27:31.328
Why do you think I agreed
to come all the way out here?

27:31.395 --> 27:34.497
Can we talk about this later,
please?

27:34.565 --> 27:36.399
Fine.

27:36.467 --> 27:37.868
You know what Otto's gonna say.

27:41.172 --> 27:43.673
NUMAN:
What's the password

27:43.741 --> 27:44.774
for the Wi-Fi?

27:44.842 --> 27:47.910
"Pope Francis." Two words.

27:47.978 --> 27:49.346
You assured me she was dead.

27:49.413 --> 27:51.614
(sighs)
I was wrong.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.017
Okay.

27:56.085 --> 27:59.020
What's the worst
that can happen?

27:59.088 --> 28:02.858
That Ahmed spills the whole
story, tells her everything.

28:02.925 --> 28:04.860
One, why would he do that?

28:04.927 --> 28:08.330
Two, she needs to locate him,
then get to him before I do.

28:08.398 --> 28:10.332
She's had the documents
since last night.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.534
Amsterdam's seven
hours away by car.

28:12.602 --> 28:14.870
- She could be there by now.
- That's doubtful.

28:14.937 --> 28:18.206
Will you stop
underestimating her?

28:18.274 --> 28:19.908
I don't care
how fucking brilliant she is.

28:19.976 --> 28:21.409
She's not a magician.

28:21.477 --> 28:24.545
Well, I'm not willing
to take that risk.

28:24.613 --> 28:27.249
You think we are?

28:32.621 --> 28:34.555
Allison,

28:34.623 --> 28:37.292
you represent
the greatest penetration

28:37.360 --> 28:40.628
of American intelligence
in fucking history.

28:40.696 --> 28:43.265
SVR or KGB.

28:43.332 --> 28:46.268
My bosses
actually believe

28:46.335 --> 28:49.337
you will be director
one day.

28:49.405 --> 28:51.272
Well, they're not the
ones you're asking

28:51.339 --> 28:53.841
to march into work tomorrow as
if the world isn't about to end,

28:53.909 --> 28:57.512
- like it's just another
goddamn day at the office. - Come on.

28:57.579 --> 28:59.847
Don't protest too much.

28:59.915 --> 29:01.849
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

29:01.917 --> 29:05.386
That means both of us know
you love it.

29:05.454 --> 29:08.790
That's where you live,
the double game.

29:08.857 --> 29:12.293
Without it,
you'd be a beached fish,

29:12.360 --> 29:15.195
dying of too much oxygen.

29:23.805 --> 29:27.441
It's the "getting caught" part
I'm not so crazy about.

29:27.508 --> 29:29.743
I know.

29:36.884 --> 29:40.287
We'll be waiting for her
in Amsterdam.

29:44.592 --> 29:46.626
Saul Berenson gave you
those documents in confidence,

29:46.694 --> 29:49.229
to give to me, not to plaster
all over the Internet.

29:49.297 --> 29:50.564
Since when did
we give the CIA

29:50.631 --> 29:53.200
veto power over what we publish?

29:53.268 --> 29:55.202
She's got a point.
Transparency's one

29:55.270 --> 29:57.303
of our guiding principles.
"An open society."

29:57.371 --> 29:59.038
It's on the
fucking card.

29:59.106 --> 30:00.640
Have you already forgotten
how many people

30:00.708 --> 30:03.710
have fucking died
because of this? I nearly did.

30:03.778 --> 30:05.679
So did you.

30:05.746 --> 30:07.681
- She's in Amsterdam.
- Jamila?

30:07.748 --> 30:11.317
Yeah. Her husband's pension
is automatically rerouted

30:11.385 --> 30:13.820
from an account in Amman
to an NBN bank

30:13.888 --> 30:15.154
in the Zeeburg
district of Amsterdam.

30:15.222 --> 30:17.156
- Did you get an address on her?
- No.

30:17.224 --> 30:18.391
- But I can keep trying.
- Okay.

30:18.459 --> 30:20.994
Do. In the meantime,
I'll get on the road.

30:21.061 --> 30:24.430
There's a garage full
of cars. Take your pick.

30:24.498 --> 30:26.432
- Thank you.
- How on earth will you find

30:26.500 --> 30:29.635
- one woman in the whole of Amsterdam?
- One Iraqi woman.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.804
- Who probably changed her name.
- Definitely did.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.838
But I have a former colleague
there in the expat community.

30:33.912 --> 30:37.576
And meanwhile, what, we just punt a
decision on the documents?

30:37.644 --> 30:41.080
To be continued, Laura.
To be continued.

30:51.213 --> 30:52.405
_

30:53.593 --> 30:54.550
_

30:55.405 --> 30:57.128
_

30:57.129 --> 30:58.129
_

30:58.531 --> 31:01.033
Zaheer.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.634
You can't come.

31:03.769 --> 31:05.703
What's the issue?

31:05.771 --> 31:07.772
His passport has
a Jordanian stamp in it.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.775
We won't make it past
the first border.

31:10.843 --> 31:13.478
It was on holiday.
Two years ago.

31:13.546 --> 31:14.412
Doesn't matter.

31:14.479 --> 31:15.547
Hey.

31:15.614 --> 31:17.248
We have a
cover here.

31:17.315 --> 31:20.885
We do construction work in
Istanbul and not jihad in Syria.

31:20.953 --> 31:23.821
You want to take the risk,
be my guest. But not with me.

31:23.889 --> 31:24.507
Wait.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.171
_

31:25.172 --> 31:26.361
_

31:26.362 --> 31:28.942
_

31:28.943 --> 31:30.258
_

31:30.259 --> 31:31.482
_

31:31.483 --> 31:32.476
_

31:32.477 --> 31:33.838
_

31:35.568 --> 31:37.334
Sorry, Zaheer,
not this time.

31:37.402 --> 31:39.270
Get new papers,
we'll see you there.

31:39.905 --> 31:40.819
_

31:40.820 --> 31:41.814
_

31:42.240 --> 31:43.942
Zaheer.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.126
_

31:54.018 --> 31:55.686
Okay. Let's go.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.928
(knocking)

32:07.065 --> 32:08.466
Just a minute!

32:24.248 --> 32:26.182
Hey.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.051
You okay?

32:28.119 --> 32:30.721
Yeah.

32:30.788 --> 32:34.057
I just thought
we should be together tonight.

32:35.292 --> 32:37.560
Come in.

32:44.132 --> 32:47.275
_

32:54.478 --> 32:56.746
(indistinct chatter)

33:09.226 --> 33:11.560
- (door shuts)
- (sighs)

33:11.628 --> 33:14.896
Carrie. My friend,
is that really you?

33:14.964 --> 33:16.898
Who else?

33:16.966 --> 33:18.367
Up to your old tricks, I see.

33:18.434 --> 33:20.035
How do I look?

33:20.102 --> 33:22.171
Uh, I have to love it.

33:22.238 --> 33:24.239
It's good to see you.

33:24.307 --> 33:25.874
You have no idea.

33:25.941 --> 33:28.443
So, you been driving a cab long?

33:28.511 --> 33:30.945
A few years now.
It pays for night school.

33:31.013 --> 33:33.382
- I'm getting my MBA.
- That's great, Esam.

33:33.449 --> 33:36.685
You got me out of Iraq, Carrie,
gave me a second chance.

33:36.752 --> 33:38.186
I'm gonna make
the most of it.

33:38.253 --> 33:40.421
Well, looks like you're doing
just that.

33:40.489 --> 33:42.890
So you want my report now
or later?

33:42.957 --> 33:45.459
- Now is good.
- It was too easy.

33:45.527 --> 33:47.295
Third call I made was
to the Iraqi Refugee

33:47.362 --> 33:49.297
Assistance Project. Guess what.

33:49.364 --> 33:51.799
Turns out she's
the bloody treasurer there.

33:51.866 --> 33:53.801
And not only that,
using her real name.

33:53.868 --> 33:55.069
Jamila Nazari.

33:55.136 --> 33:56.937
- You're kidding.
- No.

33:57.005 --> 33:59.073
Not trying to hide.
Not in any way at all.

33:59.140 --> 34:01.309
Is there a husband
in the picture?

34:01.376 --> 34:02.677
She's a widow.

34:02.744 --> 34:03.944
A boyfriend?

34:04.012 --> 34:05.213
Lives alone.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.047
So you know where.

34:07.115 --> 34:08.447
Of course.

34:08.516 --> 34:09.850
Should we go there now?

34:09.918 --> 34:12.585
- We should.
- (starts engine)

34:12.652 --> 34:13.920
(exhales)

34:18.693 --> 34:20.627
(doorbell rings)

34:20.695 --> 34:22.963
(footfalls approaching)

34:27.993 --> 34:29.129

34:29.242 --> 34:30.616

34:30.723 --> 34:31.870

34:32.047 --> 34:33.574
_

34:37.001 --> 34:38.773
_

34:38.873 --> 34:40.152
_

34:41.081 --> 34:43.315
(speaking German)

34:46.053 --> 34:48.755
(thunder rumbling)

34:48.822 --> 34:51.023
(speaking German)

34:52.860 --> 34:54.693
- Jonas.
- Hey.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.085
_

34:59.200 --> 35:00.336
_

35:00.687 --> 35:01.401

35:08.838 --> 35:11.406

35:18.347 --> 35:19.983

35:20.070 --> 35:21.849
_

35:22.146 --> 35:24.268
_

35:24.723 --> 35:26.011
Yeah.

35:26.012 --> 35:27.330
_

35:27.331 --> 35:28.875
_

35:29.869 --> 35:30.908

35:41.087 --> 35:43.546

35:44.042 --> 35:46.210
Um...

35:46.211 --> 35:47.304
_

35:47.305 --> 35:49.203
_

35:49.204 --> 35:52.265

35:54.028 --> 35:54.868

36:09.768 --> 36:12.203
(speaks German)

36:15.773 --> 36:18.042
(indistinct chatter)

36:24.749 --> 36:27.051
That's a lot of house
for a hairdresser.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.819
ESAM:
How'd you know she cuts hair?

36:28.887 --> 36:32.223
It's what she did in Baghdad.

36:36.982 --> 36:38.252
Carrie.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.911
Shouldn't we be following her?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.946
No. I want you to go ring
the doorbell now.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.315
- Okay.
- If someone answers,

36:59.383 --> 37:00.583
ask if they called for a cab.

37:00.650 --> 37:03.552
I'm looking for this man.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.788
Ahmed Nazari.

37:05.856 --> 37:08.358
Her husband.

37:08.425 --> 37:09.558
You got it?

37:09.626 --> 37:10.894
Got it.

37:10.961 --> 37:13.897
Check to see
if the house is alarmed.

37:13.964 --> 37:16.199
(door opens)

37:35.184 --> 37:37.052
♪

38:06.014 --> 38:07.448
It's definitely him.

38:07.515 --> 38:08.749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:10.618 --> 38:11.718
Alarm system?

38:11.786 --> 38:13.220
Not that I could see.

38:13.288 --> 38:14.488
What now?

38:14.556 --> 38:16.324
Now we wait for him to go out.

38:16.391 --> 38:19.293
Why not just go put
a gun to his face?

38:19.361 --> 38:20.793
He's got no incentive
to talk to me.

38:20.861 --> 38:22.195
Not yet, anyway.

38:22.263 --> 38:24.130
I want to get a look
inside the house first.

38:25.899 --> 38:29.569
ADAL: Is this really
how you want to go out?

38:29.636 --> 38:31.237
One of those
poor old actors

38:31.305 --> 38:34.007
you literally have to
drag off the stage?

38:34.075 --> 38:36.076
You know what, Dar...

day, but six months from now,

38:40.481 --> 38:41.914
or a year.

38:41.983 --> 38:43.416
And it will shame you.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.787
Take him straight
to the airfield.

38:47.855 --> 38:49.621
No stops, no detours,

38:49.689 --> 38:51.957
put him directly on the plane.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.592
- Yes, sir.
- I fail to see

what more I could've
done for you, Saul.

38:55.962 --> 38:58.297
Well, you might've trusted me.

38:58.365 --> 39:00.799
You made that impossible.

She has finally
brought you down,

39:05.705 --> 39:07.906
like I always
said she would.

39:10.243 --> 39:11.576
Fuck off.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.128
What are you doing, sir?

39:30.195 --> 39:31.562
I'm calling
for my goddamn laundry,

39:31.630 --> 39:33.797
if that's okay with you.

39:56.888 --> 39:58.923
Okay, call me the second
he starts back for the house.

39:58.990 --> 40:00.157
And don't get too close.

40:00.224 --> 40:01.324
Remember, he's already seen you.

They couldn't
find your laundry, sir.

When they do,
they'll forward it to you.
