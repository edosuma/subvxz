<i>September 30th, 1939.</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:11.213
<i>We were herded
onto prison trains near Grodno.</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:15.382
<i>Conditions were
very cramped and damp.</i>

01:16.850 --> 01:18.519
<i>It is very hard to sleep.</i>

01:19.853 --> 01:23.891
<i>I don't know how long some of
the other injured men can last.</i>

01:25.359 --> 01:28.028
<i>The icicles that form
on the window grill</i>

01:28.963 --> 01:30.999
<i>provide the only drinking water.</i>

01:36.237 --> 01:38.874
<i>October 9th, 1939.</i>

01:40.841 --> 01:42.676
<i>We are off the train at last.</i>

01:44.044 --> 01:47.948
<i>Now, apparently, we are
no longer prisoners but guests.</i>

01:49.216 --> 01:51.952
<i>On several occasions,
NKVD officers</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:55.890
<i>have summoned some of us for
interrogation during the night.</i>

01:57.525 --> 02:00.961
<i>With this sort of madness,
it is little wonder</i>

02:01.128 --> 02:04.332
<i>that we are at a loss
as to what should be done.</i>

02:08.033 --> 02:10.237
<i>March 20th, 1940.</i>

02:11.906 --> 02:15.576
<i>It seems the Soviets are taking
a softer line with us now.</i>

02:16.944 --> 02:20.948
<i>Rumors are rife among the men
that our release is imminent.</i>

02:24.117 --> 02:26.420
<i>April 15th, 1940.</i>

02:27.855 --> 02:31.125
<i>At last. My prayers
have finally been answered.</i>

02:31.859 --> 02:33.994
<i>My name was read out
this morning.</i>

02:35.162 --> 02:36.629
<i>Spring is in the air,</i>

02:37.164 --> 02:40.000
<i>and I have not felt this alive
in many months.</i>

02:41.368 --> 02:44.004
<i>My hope is that
this is the last time</i>

02:44.137 --> 02:46.908
<i>I will ever have to
travel like this.</i>

03:19.539 --> 03:21.742
No need to be so keen, lad.

03:24.212 --> 03:25.814
Suicide, most likely.

03:26.980 --> 03:28.015
Sir.

03:33.386 --> 03:34.288
Oh, wonderful.

03:40.427 --> 03:42.363
Hopefully, that will be
his suicide note.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.067
Poor sod.

03:48.002 --> 03:50.571
- Right. Let's get him up.
- Yes, sir.

03:52.105 --> 03:53.007
Mind your step.

03:56.010 --> 03:58.780
British military
occupation ends in Iraq.

04:01.248 --> 04:04.619
Western Post! British
military occupation ends in Iraq.

04:05.218 --> 04:07.254
So... Sandy can cover the docks.

04:07.987 --> 04:09.523
McCloud, the Redcliffe stuff,

04:10.525 --> 04:14.162
and John gets the union story...
for his sins.

04:15.062 --> 04:16.063
Nothing too controversial.

04:17.063 --> 04:19.165
Underwood, the Cider Festival.

04:19.265 --> 04:21.236
That's it.

04:22.036 --> 04:22.837
Off you go.

04:28.008 --> 04:30.245
Hey, I said no.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.049
No one wants to hear
about suicide, Stephen.

04:34.481 --> 04:35.315
Not now.

04:36.183 --> 04:38.053
It's bad for circulation.

04:39.152 --> 04:40.254
What if it's not suicide?

04:41.087 --> 04:43.023
I have a contact up at the camp.

04:43.858 --> 04:45.059
Stephen, dear boy,

04:45.592 --> 04:49.063
did the police
give any indication

04:49.597 --> 04:52.767
that they thought it might be
anything other than suicide?

04:55.234 --> 04:56.104
No.

04:56.203 --> 04:57.204
Exactly.

04:58.037 --> 05:00.140
So please don't try my patience.

05:01.075 --> 05:04.779
War's a terrible thing
and many can't cope,

05:05.044 --> 05:06.347
and there's the end of it.

05:07.582 --> 05:09.084
There's no story here.

05:10.484 --> 05:11.785
Do I make myself clear?

05:13.419 --> 05:14.254
Yes.

05:14.654 --> 05:16.291
Right. Thank you. Off you go.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.137
Can you file this, Maisie?
Thanks.

05:34.974 --> 05:36.743
- Rose?
- Yes, Mr. Underwood.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.649
Have you, er, ever been
to the Cider Festival?

05:56.097 --> 05:57.298
Good evening, Mr. Underwood.

05:58.065 --> 06:00.135
- Late again?
- I had to work.

06:01.436 --> 06:02.169
I see.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.140
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

06:42.342 --> 06:46.212
<i>Despite the passing of the Polish
Resettlement Act earlier this year,</i>

06:46.380 --> 06:50.183
<i>the West Country is witnessing a growing
number of unexplained suicides.</i>

06:51.185 --> 06:54.655
<i>The men are all ex-servicemen
from the Polish Second Corps.</i>

06:55.488 --> 06:58.859
<i>A coincidence? Or could this be
something more sinister?</i>

07:22.349 --> 07:23.318
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.419
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see the Captain.

07:59.620 --> 08:00.722
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

08:05.058 --> 08:05.926
One moment, sir.

08:09.063 --> 08:12.267
Sir, Colonel Pietrowski's arrived
with the two DPs from Stowell Park.

08:14.068 --> 08:14.969
Once we're done here,

08:15.368 --> 08:16.337
tell the Quartermaster
to make an inventory

08:17.070 --> 08:18.905
of everything we're short of. Double
it, and put in a written order.

08:19.039 --> 08:19.774
Yes, Captain.

08:20.241 --> 08:21.308
Morning.

08:33.785 --> 08:35.355
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

08:41.528 --> 08:43.130
This all seems to be in order.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.131
If you'd like to
bring them in, Colonel,

08:45.265 --> 08:46.634
there are just a few
signatures required.

08:47.034 --> 08:47.769
Of course.

08:50.270 --> 08:51.805
Colonel, perhaps you
and your man

08:51.905 --> 08:53.741
would like a spot of breakfast
before the drive home?

08:55.108 --> 08:56.910
We don't have much,
but it's hot.

08:57.310 --> 08:59.379
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Er, Jeanette...

09:00.280 --> 09:02.515
once you're finished, would you drop
the Colonel's aide off at the mess?

09:02.616 --> 09:03.451
Yes, sir.

09:04.485 --> 09:05.286
John.

09:12.558 --> 09:13.895
I'll talk to you later.

09:14.327 --> 09:15.395
- This way, Colonel.
- Colonel.

09:17.063 --> 09:20.601
My name's Stephen Underwood.
The Captain is my brother.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.969
I'm a journalist for
The Western Post.

09:23.602 --> 09:25.238
Colonel Janusz Pietrowski,

09:25.338 --> 09:26.806
formerly of the Polish
Second Corps,

09:26.906 --> 09:28.508
Acting Resettlement
Corps Liaison.

09:29.776 --> 09:32.145
- Colonel, pleased to meet you.
- And me you, Mr. Underwood.

09:32.746 --> 09:33.514
Shall we?

09:42.990 --> 09:44.859
Colonel?

09:45.358 --> 09:46.726
I said no, Stephen.

09:47.361 --> 09:49.496
Please, Captain.
Your brother's very welcome.

09:49.663 --> 09:51.698
I was wondering if
you'd like to comment on the...

09:52.366 --> 09:54.401
suicide of another
Polish soldier yesterday?

09:55.334 --> 09:56.570
Sosnowicz.

09:57.672 --> 09:59.373
You don't look
very surprised, Colonel.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.309
Well, Mr. Underwood,
it's always most distressing

10:02.409 --> 10:04.477
when a proud man loses all hope.

10:05.312 --> 10:06.513
And why
would that be, Colonel?

10:07.514 --> 10:11.552
Men like Sosnowicz spent the war
fighting for their homeland, Mr. Underwood,

10:11.885 --> 10:13.419
which is now part
of the Soviet Union,

10:13.553 --> 10:15.622
which regards them
as enemies of the state.

10:16.557 --> 10:19.260
He'd just learned his entire
family had been murdered.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.595
Colonel, please,
we have no proof of that.

10:22.395 --> 10:25.232
Clearly, he believed it
enough to take his own life, Captain.

10:25.665 --> 10:27.200
And why do you believe it,
Colonel?

10:28.401 --> 10:31.237
Because we all seem to have
forgotten that in 1939

10:31.371 --> 10:33.274
the Soviet Union invaded Poland,

10:33.841 --> 10:37.178
in alliance with the Nazis and with
the same intent, Mr. Underwood.

10:38.478 --> 10:39.979
To wipe Poland from the map.

10:40.614 --> 10:43.418
To destroy its culture,
and its people.

10:45.052 --> 10:47.989
When the Soviets
retook Poland in 1944,

10:48.622 --> 10:51.424
they allowed the Nazis
to crush the Warsaw Uprising

10:52.358 --> 10:54.895
to help eliminate any possible
threat to their own occupation.

10:56.429 --> 11:00.267
The recent so-called "free"
elections in Poland

11:01.400 --> 11:03.303
are no more than
a Soviet puppet show.

11:04.438 --> 11:06.907
No, Poland's true government
is still exiled in London,

11:07.406 --> 11:10.610
but it is no longer recognized
by Britain or the United States.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.480
And last year,
the Free Polish Armed Forces

11:13.579 --> 11:15.715
were excluded from
your Victory Parade.

11:16.683 --> 11:18.685
So as not to antagonize
Comrade Stalin.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.521
What does this tell you,
Mr. Underwood?

11:23.090 --> 11:23.925
That all is well?

11:28.728 --> 11:30.797
I understand the world
is weary of war.

11:31.631 --> 11:32.732
We all are.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.036
But that's no excuse
for naivety.

11:37.438 --> 11:38.505
Your brother knows this.

11:40.606 --> 11:43.209
He still has the unenviable
task of trying to persuade

11:43.309 --> 11:45.611
my fellow compatriots
to return to Poland,

11:46.447 --> 11:48.881
knowing full well he cannot
guarantee their safety.

11:49.683 --> 11:51.852
No one has to go back
if they don't want to, Colonel.

11:54.454 --> 11:56.523
Yes, Captain. Of course.

12:00.293 --> 12:03.331
Colonel, please.
Breakfast is waiting.

12:17.510 --> 12:19.679
- Mm.
- I have to see you tonight.

12:20.347 --> 12:23.583
- Eight thirty, at the King's Arms.
- No, that's too public.

12:23.717 --> 12:25.318
No, there are only ever
locals there.

12:25.819 --> 12:27.554
Mm. Fine.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.155
Eight-ish?

12:32.458 --> 12:34.529
I have to go.
Mason wants to see me.

12:35.661 --> 12:36.696
Do you have to?

12:37.364 --> 12:39.100
You know I do.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.262
Come.

13:09.597 --> 13:11.598
Ah! Thank you, Stanley.

13:17.337 --> 13:18.404
You're still on duty?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.574
I hardly ever see you
out of uniform these days.

13:23.577 --> 13:24.712
You hardly see me at all.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.181
I know, I'm sorry. There's a bit
of a flap on at the moment.

13:27.747 --> 13:28.616
Anyway, good of you to come.

13:29.817 --> 13:33.587
We've been invited to the
annual ball at the Robinsons'.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.257
Oh, God. Is it that
time of year already?

13:36.356 --> 13:38.757
I know, tedious in
the extreme, but, er...

13:38.924 --> 13:41.661
I would really appreciate it if we
could attend together this year.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.366
- Your parents will be there.
- I'd rather not, if it's all the same to you.

13:46.601 --> 13:49.169
It might look at bit odd if, er,
if I go alone.

13:49.836 --> 13:52.573
Might set a few tongues wagging.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.241
- If we must.
- Splendid.

13:56.643 --> 13:57.611
Oh!

13:57.711 --> 13:59.379
One more thing before you go.

14:00.045 --> 14:01.848
You might be in
the perfect place

14:02.582 --> 14:04.250
to do me another favor,
if you would?

14:04.651 --> 14:07.621
Er... Loboda and Nowak,

14:07.721 --> 14:09.556
two DPs who arrived
in your camp this morning.

14:09.655 --> 14:11.925
You're very well informed,
as always.

14:12.659 --> 14:16.096
Could you be a real brick and keep
me appraised of their whereabouts?

14:16.563 --> 14:18.665
Movements, visitors, friends,
that sort of thing.

14:19.432 --> 14:20.200
Why?

14:20.768 --> 14:23.771
It's probably nothing.
Some vague memo from London.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.674
Nothing to worry about.
Just so I know.

14:28.741 --> 14:30.777
I wouldn't expect you to run
across town every morning.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.711
A simple telephone call
will suffice.

14:33.246 --> 14:36.850
I know you must be busy with your
whole repatriation commotion.

14:36.949 --> 14:38.919
- Yes.
- Mm.

14:40.821 --> 14:41.889
Is that all?

14:44.256 --> 14:45.859
Well, I should be getting back.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.496
Oh, please, don't let me
detain you any longer.

14:49.663 --> 14:51.664
Er, but if we could, er...

14:52.097 --> 14:53.700
keep this just
between ourselves?

14:54.168 --> 14:54.935
Of course.

14:56.669 --> 14:57.804
So we're happy then?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.707
What?

15:01.741 --> 15:05.045
- The Robinsons' ball?
- Yes. Yes.

15:05.712 --> 15:06.680
- Fine.
- Hmm.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.973
You know why he
married you, hmm?

15:37.810 --> 15:40.814
He is not the monster
you want him to be.

15:41.715 --> 15:45.086
So your father has the right to
sell you to the highest bidder?

15:48.889 --> 15:51.025
They genuinely thought
he would make a good husband.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.763
They only want
what's best for me.

16:02.669 --> 16:03.404
Did they know?

16:07.507 --> 16:09.542
Marriage isn't
about love for them.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.279
And I wanted to marry him.

16:14.948 --> 16:15.949
I was in love with him.

16:18.851 --> 16:21.188
Obviously, I didn't know then
what I know now.

16:22.755 --> 16:24.625
But our love
is of a different kind now.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.764
Stephen, he's my friend.

16:32.765 --> 16:33.767
It's a lie.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.569
So what do you want me to do?

16:37.938 --> 16:40.073
You want me to just
leave my husband, my job,

16:40.207 --> 16:42.976
turn my back on my family
and run off to London with you?

16:43.776 --> 16:44.978
That's impossible.

16:48.781 --> 16:50.916
I'm not sure how much faith
I have in your big story

16:51.016 --> 16:52.986
because if what the Polish
Colonel says is true,

16:53.086 --> 16:53.854
you have no proof.

16:54.821 --> 16:56.490
And as unfortunate as they are,

16:56.590 --> 16:58.225
these suicides
are still just that.

16:59.559 --> 17:01.861
Suicides. Nothing more.

17:15.909 --> 17:19.780
- Evening, gents. What can I get you?
- Er, how much for this?

17:21.381 --> 17:23.016
- Fourpence.
- Hmm.

17:23.117 --> 17:25.051
- And for this?
- Thruppence-ha'penny.

17:27.352 --> 17:28.823
Two pints of the Special,
please, sir.

17:30.923 --> 17:31.825
Slops for swine.

18:16.069 --> 18:17.504
- Same again, sir?
- Please.

18:19.104 --> 18:20.473
Bloody scab labour.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.677
There's talk of letting 'em
down the mines next.

18:24.111 --> 18:27.179
The war's over.
Send the buggers back, I say.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.883
Instead of giving 'em
our boys' jobs.

18:32.084 --> 18:33.920
Can't go back
because of the Bolshies?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.092
Well, you won't escape
the Reds here, son.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.928
Not with the Labour Party
running the country.

18:43.096 --> 18:46.966
- You know nothing.
- Who's asking you, Polak?

18:52.304 --> 18:54.908
I am not Polak. I am Russian.

18:55.007 --> 18:57.844
What do I care? You're all
the bloody same. Now go home!

18:57.945 --> 18:59.846
- All right, we're going.
- Well, go on then!

18:59.946 --> 19:01.115
- Hey, we are going.
- And don't come back!

19:02.082 --> 19:03.382
You're not welcome here!

19:03.950 --> 19:06.120
All right, Bill. It's still my name
above the door. That's enough.

19:17.030 --> 19:17.798
We're leaving.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.772
Eh, lad, what about your drinks?

19:29.976 --> 19:31.011
Stephen?

19:34.046 --> 19:34.814
Stephen?

19:48.928 --> 19:50.997
Mr. Nowak, it's me, Jeanette
Mitchell, from the camp.

19:51.930 --> 19:54.634
Yes, er...
we have to get back, sorry.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.970
He said he was a Russian.

19:59.105 --> 20:00.606
I write for a newspaper.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.976
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

20:04.011 --> 20:05.546
No.

20:07.013 --> 20:09.949
You're a Russian,
pretending to be a Pole, why?

20:11.784 --> 20:13.253
Mr. Loboda, please!

20:16.989 --> 20:19.625
I am not pretending
to be anyone.

20:21.194 --> 20:25.032
If you saw what I saw,
then you understand.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.534
- What have you seen?
- Ivan.

20:30.003 --> 20:32.840
They kill you like
they want to kill me.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.077
Who wants to kill you?

20:39.012 --> 20:40.047
They all do.

20:43.582 --> 20:44.351
Stephen?

20:57.996 --> 20:59.565
- Stephen...
- I'm fine.

21:10.043 --> 21:11.145
Please, Stephen.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.082
- What did he have?
- I don't remember.

21:16.682 --> 21:18.618
Clothes mainly. Hardly anything.

21:21.854 --> 21:24.557
Don't do this.
You heard what he said.

21:26.292 --> 21:28.093
Don't you think if, er...

21:29.062 --> 21:31.064
someone wanted to kill him,
they would have done so already?

21:31.864 --> 21:33.299
Not if they don't know
who he is.

21:42.242 --> 21:43.911
He could be involved
in the suicides.

21:44.843 --> 21:46.179
Loboda could be the story.

21:50.048 --> 21:50.883
Let me do this.

21:52.919 --> 21:53.719
For us.

24:58.103 --> 24:58.971
It's Polish.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.476
He could be keeping it
for a friend.

25:04.509 --> 25:05.278
No.

25:06.912 --> 25:09.448
Rose. Rose Miller,
the typist at work.

25:10.416 --> 25:11.784
Her family's from Poland.

25:13.085 --> 25:14.220
She could translate it for me.

25:14.321 --> 25:17.457
No! What about Loboda?
What if he discovers it's gone?

25:17.724 --> 25:19.692
Tell me things don't go missing
around here all the time.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.761
Are you drunk?
What if he thinks it was me?

25:22.261 --> 25:25.065
Mm, just put him off
for a while.

25:27.266 --> 25:29.535
I thought this was supposed
to be about us?

25:34.506 --> 25:35.308
It is.

25:36.543 --> 25:39.313
Because it seems like you want
me to take all the risks.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.019
Give me the box.

25:53.059 --> 25:53.994
I need to do this.

26:46.379 --> 26:47.380
Huh!

26:54.387 --> 26:56.990
Ah.

27:49.708 --> 27:50.476
Mr. Underwood?

27:51.410 --> 27:54.080
I did it.
The story, the Cider Festival.

27:56.415 --> 27:59.452
Thank you.
I need another favor.

27:59.753 --> 28:02.254
- Of course, anything.
- I need this translated.

28:02.755 --> 28:04.489
If you can ask your father.

28:05.057 --> 28:07.460
- What's it about?
- I don't know.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.729
Again, just between us.

28:13.431 --> 28:14.601
As soon as you can.

28:24.444 --> 28:25.645
Stephen Underwood.

28:41.460 --> 28:42.261
Stephen!

28:43.795 --> 28:45.465
They can't find him anywhere.

28:49.268 --> 28:51.003
My sincere apologies
again, Colonel.

28:51.103 --> 28:53.805
The truth is, Captain, Mr. Loboda
has a habit of disappearing,

28:54.474 --> 28:57.677
as Mr. Nowak knows all too well.
He's a very troubled man.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.313
Sometimes his imagination
gets the better of him.

29:01.080 --> 29:01.848
We'll find him.

29:19.265 --> 29:20.800
Are you going to tell them
about the box?

29:20.900 --> 29:22.369
Still think I did
the wrong thing?

29:37.882 --> 29:39.552
He can't just have disappeared.

29:40.152 --> 29:43.622
The Poles have moved him again.
Find out where!

29:56.768 --> 29:58.771
<i>Morning, Mabel.
Is Richard in yet?</i>

30:00.739 --> 30:03.175
My father wanted to know
where you got these from.

30:08.581 --> 30:09.381
Why?

30:10.417 --> 30:11.516
He said they're extremely
valuable

30:11.617 --> 30:12.652
and that you should be careful.

30:15.187 --> 30:16.022
Thank you.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.632
<i>I don't
understand what is happening.</i>

30:28.266 --> 30:30.635
<i>Earlier, our train
stopped at a siding.</i>

30:31.169 --> 30:33.872
<i>We were met by Soviet guards
and ordered to disembark.</i>

30:34.841 --> 30:36.409
<i>There is a large forest here.</i>

30:37.776 --> 30:39.746
<i>We have loaded into
black prison vans.</i>

30:40.713 --> 30:41.815
<i>I have to stop writing now.</i>

32:19.711 --> 32:21.146
Yes, sir, can I help you?

32:21.813 --> 32:23.382
I'm looking for
a Colonel Pietrowski.

32:23.716 --> 32:24.751
Yes, sir, follow me.

32:27.719 --> 32:28.755
Colonel Pietrowski.

32:31.923 --> 32:32.958
Can I get you anything?

32:36.896 --> 32:37.731
You don't mind?

32:49.708 --> 32:50.776
Why would a Russian...

32:51.910 --> 32:56.216
have the diary, letters
and personal effects

32:56.315 --> 32:57.883
of a young Polish cadet,

32:58.383 --> 33:01.887
interned in a POW camp
in the Soviet Union?

33:02.721 --> 33:03.756
And, er...

33:05.557 --> 33:07.192
why does he think
everyone wants to kill him?

33:10.729 --> 33:13.966
I really have no idea what you are
talking about, Mr. Underwood.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.601
If you'll excuse me,
I have things to attend to.

33:16.735 --> 33:17.603
I have the box.

33:20.104 --> 33:21.073
I want to help.

33:21.774 --> 33:24.407
No, Mr. Underwood,
you want a story.

33:24.409 --> 33:26.779
Yes, I want the story, and then
we both get what we want.

33:27.845 --> 33:29.448
Trust me, there's nothing
you can do.

33:29.782 --> 33:32.252
If you really want to help,
then return the box to me.

33:32.752 --> 33:33.787
Let me see Loboda.

33:34.986 --> 33:36.790
Goodbye, Mr. Underwood.

33:38.791 --> 33:40.794
Colonel. Colonel!

33:42.928 --> 33:43.996
Then I'll...

33:45.030 --> 33:47.267
take this to the authorities and
I'll tell them where I got it.

33:50.002 --> 33:51.838
I had the diary and letters
translated.

33:56.809 --> 33:58.011
Come with me.

34:08.920 --> 34:09.922
Wait here.

34:43.621 --> 34:45.824
My aide will take you
to see Mr. Loboda.

34:46.291 --> 34:47.659
So you do know where he is?

34:52.530 --> 34:54.431
Once you know the truth,
you can try as you might,

34:54.532 --> 34:56.333
but I will not support you
in this any further.

34:56.902 --> 34:59.305
I will deny any involvement,
any knowledge of this at all

34:59.405 --> 35:00.907
and you will not see
Loboda again.

35:03.008 --> 35:04.142
Do I make myself clear?

35:20.858 --> 35:22.961
Here, at five o'clock.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.898
We will pick you up
and take you to him.

35:26.564 --> 35:27.400
You come alone.

35:28.566 --> 35:30.035
How do I know I can trust you?

35:31.037 --> 35:32.038
You don't.

35:32.939 --> 35:35.909
Then I'd like to, er,
interview Loboda.

35:36.842 --> 35:38.945
- And I'd like it recorded.
- Why?

35:40.079 --> 35:41.514
Once you have the box,
I have nothing.

35:44.916 --> 35:46.119
That can be arranged.

35:47.153 --> 35:50.023
And, er, I'll take those
translations, if you don't mind.

35:55.128 --> 35:55.928
Thank you.

36:43.709 --> 36:45.644
I expect you to pay
for the damage.

36:46.043 --> 36:47.746
- Who did this?
- The police.

36:48.747 --> 36:52.184
They said they suspected you of being
in possession of contraband goods.

36:52.383 --> 36:54.119
That's ridiculous,
and you know it.

36:54.419 --> 36:56.688
Well, I'm sorry, but, er...

36:56.988 --> 37:01.026
with all your comings and goings
lately I really couldn't say.

37:02.028 --> 37:05.030
This is still my house...

37:05.430 --> 37:07.467
as far as I'm aware,
Mr. Underwood.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.517
Nettie.

37:28.854 --> 37:30.056
Nettie, please.

37:31.856 --> 37:32.657
I'm sorry.

37:33.992 --> 37:37.262
- What is it?
- They've taken the box.

37:39.231 --> 37:40.066
Then it's over.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.869
- I'm going to see Loboda.
- You know where he is?

37:44.202 --> 37:45.237
Pietrowski has him.

37:46.338 --> 37:48.240
So how do you know
they didn't take it?

37:48.608 --> 37:51.044
Because I said I'd give back the
box if they let me talk to him.

37:52.276 --> 37:53.579
How do you know
they're not lying?

37:53.678 --> 37:55.847
You have no idea who
these people really are.

37:56.881 --> 37:57.849
I need to know.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.686
It has nothing to do with you.

38:07.726 --> 38:09.195
If anything happens to me,

38:10.195 --> 38:11.664
I want you to give these
to the police.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.168
But...

40:29.200 --> 40:30.336
Stay here.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.811
They tell me I can trust you.

41:13.378 --> 41:15.280
That I can tell you everything.

41:18.215 --> 41:19.017
Yes.

41:20.418 --> 41:21.853
You took the box?

41:27.258 --> 41:29.262
How can I trust a thief?

41:32.430 --> 41:34.066
I didn't mean any harm.

41:35.934 --> 41:37.336
You put it in your paper?

41:40.939 --> 41:42.508
I'll do everything I can.

41:46.477 --> 41:47.345
Please sit down.

42:39.597 --> 42:42.034
My name is Ivan Krivozertsev.

42:46.303 --> 42:48.374
My home is near Smolensk.

42:49.340 --> 42:50.208
Small town.

42:51.343 --> 42:52.545
Nove Biatoki.

42:55.314 --> 42:59.151
I was there
when they first come.

43:14.832 --> 43:16.836
<i>People say
they were Finns.</i>

43:19.537 --> 43:21.373
<i>But my friend Kisselev...</i>

43:23.874 --> 43:27.412
<i>he saw their four-cornered hats.</i>

43:34.352 --> 43:36.188
They were all Polish.

43:40.858 --> 43:44.462
Every day, they put them in
<i>chornly voron.</i>

43:45.396 --> 43:48.467
<i>Prison vans.
Move to forest.</i>

44:20.631 --> 44:26.639
In forest, Bolsheviks tie
their hands behind backs.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.042
<i>A rope
round the neck...</i>

44:31.876 --> 44:34.712
<i>so you strangle if you move.</i>

44:42.653 --> 44:43.755
They put them...

44:45.423 --> 44:46.257
<i>K zemie.</i>

44:47.425 --> 44:48.160
<i>To ground.</i>

44:50.061 --> 44:50.962
<i>And they put...</i>

44:52.130 --> 44:52.932
<i>guns...</i>

44:55.066 --> 44:56.568
<i>to back of the neck.</i>

44:59.704 --> 45:00.939
One after another...

45:02.474 --> 45:04.943
bodies fall into the pit...

45:08.246 --> 45:10.615
face to ground.

45:16.521 --> 45:19.991
And guns loaded
for the next group.

45:21.459 --> 45:23.496
Over and over again...

45:24.662 --> 45:27.099
until job finish.

45:35.941 --> 45:39.778
When Germans come,
they have Polyaki too.

45:40.477 --> 45:41.546
<i>Prisoners.</i>

45:42.613 --> 45:45.082
<i>Making roads good for tanks.</i>

45:48.486 --> 45:50.356
<i>First,
Germans did not look.</i>

45:51.990 --> 45:53.592
<i>Only Polyaki look.</i>

46:07.671 --> 46:10.742
<i>Then I tell
what I saw...</i>

46:14.878 --> 46:17.248
and we begin to dig.

46:24.756 --> 46:29.361
<i>Book and letters
I took from dead man.</i>

46:30.729 --> 46:31.730
<i>Young man.</i>

46:49.381 --> 46:50.149
Where was this?

46:52.784 --> 46:53.651
Where did it happen?

46:59.557 --> 47:02.428
In forest, at Katyn.

47:28.653 --> 47:29.688
How many?

47:31.423 --> 47:34.392
To date, over 4,000 bodies.

47:36.260 --> 47:38.429
But there are three times that
still missing.

47:40.131 --> 47:45.770
Mostly officers, reservists,
lawyers, teachers... priests.

47:46.604 --> 47:50.442
Stalin knew these people would
never capitulate to Soviet rule.

47:51.977 --> 47:54.946
And Poles know all about being
occupied by foreign powers,

47:55.079 --> 47:56.881
and these were
the best of my country.

47:57.648 --> 48:00.652
They would fight for their freedom
with everything they had.

48:04.822 --> 48:06.757
Stalin murdered them so Poland

48:07.425 --> 48:09.762
could never again
rise from the ashes.

48:11.628 --> 48:12.930
And the British?

48:14.832 --> 48:15.668
They knew about this?

48:16.401 --> 48:17.336
Of course they did.

48:18.436 --> 48:21.038
The British and Americans just
wanted the whole affair to go away.

48:21.639 --> 48:24.709
They needed the Red Army
to keep fighting the Germans.

48:24.809 --> 48:27.178
They feared Stalin
would make peace with Hitler.

48:29.113 --> 48:32.383
Now, Stalin has half of Europe under
his boot, and they can do nothing.

48:34.686 --> 48:36.722
And my country is occupied.

48:37.856 --> 48:39.725
And no criticism
of Stalin is tolerated.

48:41.659 --> 48:43.128
My people
are good people.

48:45.863 --> 48:47.699
You must know what happened.

48:49.668 --> 48:50.702
You must know murderer.

48:53.171 --> 48:54.406
We need the evidence.

48:55.374 --> 48:57.709
The diary, the letters.

48:59.043 --> 49:02.746
Proof the murders were
committed in 1940 by the Soviets.

49:03.747 --> 49:07.318
And not by the Nazis in 1941,
as everyone believes.

49:13.892 --> 49:14.993
You did bring the box?

49:21.066 --> 49:22.568
It was stolen from my room.

49:32.744 --> 49:33.778
Please!

49:56.733 --> 49:57.802
Yes?

50:01.039 --> 50:01.840
What, now?

50:02.974 --> 50:03.776
Why?

50:07.945 --> 50:09.247
Fine, I'll be five minutes.

50:18.956 --> 50:21.325
What the bloody hell are you playing at?
It's the middle of the night.

50:21.793 --> 50:23.595
- It's important.
- It better had be.

50:24.061 --> 50:25.963
I need to know about
a place called Katyn.

50:27.764 --> 50:28.799
Why?

50:29.066 --> 50:31.369
Polish soldiers were
taken there in 1940.

50:32.137 --> 50:33.671
I need to know
what happened to them.

50:34.005 --> 50:35.640
Has Pietrowski
put you up to this?

50:35.773 --> 50:36.707
No.

50:36.807 --> 50:38.610
Then look it up in the papers.

50:38.943 --> 50:41.012
I need to see
the official papers.

50:41.979 --> 50:43.814
And I can't help you,
you know that.

50:44.782 --> 50:47.251
In my position, I can't be seen
fraternizing with journalists,

50:47.753 --> 50:49.488
even second-rate
provincial ones.

50:49.988 --> 50:50.856
John, please.

50:51.889 --> 50:53.156
This could explain
the suicides.

50:53.925 --> 50:56.028
Over 4,000 Polish soldiers
were murdered.

50:58.930 --> 50:59.965
- Stand down.
- Sir.

51:04.001 --> 51:07.139
It was the Germans,
the Nazis, end of story.

51:07.271 --> 51:09.006
- You know about this.
- That's the official line.

51:09.106 --> 51:10.675
Yeah, but you know
that's not true.

51:11.276 --> 51:13.044
I believe what I'm told
to believe.

51:14.345 --> 51:16.648
So you're going to bury your head
and let them get away with it?

51:16.814 --> 51:19.384
It's my job. Now, go home.

51:19.852 --> 51:21.953
You went to war to free people
from oppression,

51:22.153 --> 51:24.255
so that they had the right
to choose their own destiny.

51:24.356 --> 51:26.925
And you're going to stand there
and do nothing?

51:27.291 --> 51:28.360
Go home, Stephen.

51:29.193 --> 51:30.928
Stop trying to be something
you're not.

51:32.631 --> 51:33.364
I did that.

51:33.831 --> 51:36.667
You went to war and I stayed.
I did what I was told.

51:38.903 --> 51:40.738
But for the first time,
I have something I believe in.

51:40.872 --> 51:42.874
Don't be such a child.
The war is over.

51:43.508 --> 51:44.842
Do you really want to start
another one

51:44.943 --> 51:46.711
just to appease your own sense
of inadequacy?

51:46.843 --> 51:48.213
You didn't
have to serve, be grateful.

51:50.947 --> 51:51.716
No.

51:53.050 --> 51:54.085
You're right.

51:56.854 --> 51:59.724
I couldn't serve...
because of this.

52:13.305 --> 52:14.439
Philip Edwards.

52:15.639 --> 52:17.942
Disillusioned socialist-type
I met at Cambridge.

52:18.910 --> 52:21.113
Now works in the archive
at the Foreign Office.

52:22.345 --> 52:25.516
If it's in there...
he'll know where.

52:28.919 --> 52:30.555
This is my transport docket.

52:31.889 --> 52:35.126
And, er... this should
get you through the gate.

52:40.697 --> 52:43.567
You can improvise. Now get out.

52:46.570 --> 52:48.472
Oh, and, Stephen,
the accident.

52:48.939 --> 52:52.077
It was my fault and I know you
could have lost your eyesight.

52:52.177 --> 52:53.111
I am sorry.

53:20.537 --> 53:21.405
Did you see him?

53:22.374 --> 53:24.076
- Yeah.
- Where is he?

53:30.948 --> 53:33.017
There's only one farm
in the area that grows these.

53:38.021 --> 53:39.224
I'm going to London.

53:40.959 --> 53:43.227
I need you to hold on
to those translations.

53:46.798 --> 53:47.599
Don't go.

53:49.568 --> 53:51.535
- I have to.
- Stephen...

53:57.441 --> 53:59.144
<i>You've let this get
out of proportion.</i>

54:00.577 --> 54:02.014
In spite of everything
that happened...

54:04.014 --> 54:06.017
you must realize
I do still care about you.

54:07.485 --> 54:10.255
Then... please
just leave him alone.

54:11.456 --> 54:15.392
It's your Stephen that is
making life difficult for you.

54:15.492 --> 54:17.228
He dragged you into all this,
not me.

54:19.197 --> 54:23.235
Just... Just tell me
what he's up to.

54:26.537 --> 54:28.072
He knows where he is,
doesn't he?

54:31.008 --> 54:34.612
You must understand, this isn't
about you and Underwood anymore.

54:36.079 --> 54:40.083
You're involving yourself
in something very sensitive

54:40.184 --> 54:42.053
and potentially very damaging.

54:42.653 --> 54:44.054
Is Stephen in danger?

54:44.521 --> 54:47.424
If he's told you where
they're hiding the Russian,

54:47.525 --> 54:49.227
you have to tell me, now.

54:54.131 --> 54:54.900
Look...

54:58.802 --> 55:00.271
you tell me what you know...

55:02.039 --> 55:04.075
and you can continue
to see Underwood.

55:06.209 --> 55:07.878
As long as you don't draw
attention to yourselves,

55:08.246 --> 55:10.715
I won't say another word
about it.

55:11.182 --> 55:13.118
It will simply blow over.

55:15.119 --> 55:18.121
I don't think either of us want any
scandal in our lives right now.

55:19.823 --> 55:23.360
And I think we would both do whatever we could
to ensure that doesn't happen, wouldn't we?

59:37.481 --> 59:41.518
You're a fool.
A pig-ignorant fool.

59:43.421 --> 59:45.557
Do you honestly think
anyone cares about you?

59:46.823 --> 59:48.392
Do you think the Poles care?

59:49.360 --> 59:52.563
No one cares about you
or what you have to say!

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:02.300
Mr. Underwood?

01:01:03.867 --> 01:01:04.635
Yes.

01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:07.438
I served with your brother
in Austria.

01:01:08.439 --> 01:01:09.474
He's a good man.

01:01:17.782 --> 01:01:20.452
An address and a map.

01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:26.658
What you want is all very
hush-hush. It's been shelved.

01:01:29.226 --> 01:01:31.162
"X" marks the spot,
if you like.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.070
Things aren't the same
anymore, Mr. Underwood.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.073
During the war, we knew
what we needed to do.

01:01:43.206 --> 01:01:46.243
We knuckled down and we did it.
We didn't question anything.

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:49.847
It was all very
black and white.

01:01:51.515 --> 01:01:52.650
But now...

01:01:54.251 --> 01:01:55.687
Now nothing seems
to make any sense.

01:01:58.322 --> 01:01:59.724
Makes you wonder
who's really in charge.

01:02:07.999 --> 01:02:10.034
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.936
No, I can't stay.

01:02:12.503 --> 01:02:14.972
If there's ever anything
I can do for you.

01:02:15.072 --> 01:02:17.107
No, please, don't worry.

01:02:19.642 --> 01:02:21.646
Anything to relieve the tedium.

01:02:23.113 --> 01:02:26.650
Sometimes I wonder if I'll end up
buried in that archive, you know.

01:02:26.782 --> 01:02:28.318
Up to my eyeballs in dust.

01:02:30.553 --> 01:02:31.722
Not that anybody would notice.

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.529
My regards to your brother,
and good luck.

01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:25.642
Captain Underwood. Will
you be requiring an escort, sir?

01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:45.515
<i>"On the evidence that
we have, it is difficult to escape</i>

01:05:45.648 --> 01:05:48.051
<i>from the presumption
of Russian guilt.</i>

01:05:49.486 --> 01:05:52.189
<i>How, if Russian crime
is established,</i>

01:05:52.722 --> 01:05:55.625
<i>can we expect Poles
to live amicably</i>

01:05:55.726 --> 01:05:59.197
<i>side by side with Russians
for generations to come?"</i>

01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:06.437
<i>"This document
is explosive,</i>

01:06:07.003 --> 01:06:09.772
<i>if it was to fall
into unauthorized hands,</i>

01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:15.178
<i>the reaction on our relations
with Russia would be serious."</i>

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.932
<i>"In handling the publicity
side of the Katyn affair...</i>

01:06:36.967 --> 01:06:39.336
<i>we have been constrained</i>

01:06:39.769 --> 01:06:44.006
<i>by the urgent need for cordial
relations with the Soviet Government</i>

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.811
<i>to appear to appraise
the evidence</i>

01:06:47.945 --> 01:06:51.048
<i>with more hesitation
and lenience</i>

01:06:51.749 --> 01:06:55.820
<i>than we should do in forming
a common-sense judgement.</i>

01:07:00.823 --> 01:07:04.262
<i>We have, in fact, perforce,</i>

01:07:04.961 --> 01:07:07.264
<i>used the good name of England</i>

01:07:07.963 --> 01:07:12.936
<i>like the murderers used the little
conifers to cover up a massacre."</i>

01:07:51.842 --> 01:07:54.744
<i>"Let us think
of these things always</i>

01:07:54.845 --> 01:07:56.814
<i>and speak of them never.</i>

01:07:57.814 --> 01:08:00.985
<i>To speak of them never is the
advice which I have been giving</i>

01:08:01.084 --> 01:08:05.222
<i>to the Polish Government,
but it has been unnecessary.</i>

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:09.726
<i>Affliction and residence
in this country</i>

01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:13.664
<i>seem to be teaching them how much
better it is in political life</i>

01:08:13.963 --> 01:08:16.665
<i>to leave unsaid those things</i>

01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:19.336
<i>about which one feels
most passionately."</i>

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:00.978
Colonel.

01:09:02.946 --> 01:09:03.947
I've seen the papers.

01:09:05.648 --> 01:09:07.919
A report by a Owen O'Malley,

01:09:08.884 --> 01:09:10.353
the British Ambassador
to Poland.

01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:14.890
You were right,
they knew all along.

01:09:17.928 --> 01:09:19.930
Ivan Krivozertsev is dead.

01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:28.104
He was found yesterday,
hanging from a tree.

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:30.207
In the evening.

01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:44.955
So you see, Mr. Underwood, I doubt anyone will
ever be given the chance to see those papers.

01:09:49.559 --> 01:09:50.327
Why, er...

01:09:53.562 --> 01:09:54.965
Why didn't you hide him sooner?

01:09:57.634 --> 01:09:59.002
He wouldn't let us.

01:10:00.137 --> 01:10:03.006
It was only when you took
the box that he reconsidered.

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.647
He approached the Red Cross,
joined our troops in Italy,

01:10:11.615 --> 01:10:13.117
where he met Mr. Nowak.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:18.088
One drunken night, he let slip
he was there at Katyn...

01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:20.825
when it happened.

01:10:23.759 --> 01:10:25.028
No others made it to the West.

01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:30.034
He was the only one to escape the
area when the Soviets recaptured it.

01:10:34.804 --> 01:10:36.807
He was an embarrassment
to the Soviets.

01:10:39.977 --> 01:10:42.013
Awkward for the British.

01:10:44.046 --> 01:10:46.082
Dispensable to the Americans.

01:10:49.986 --> 01:10:52.023
He approached them
at Nuremberg and...

01:10:53.357 --> 01:10:56.227
they almost sent him back
to the Russian sector.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:03.267
Did you tell anyone you
had seen him, Mr. Underwood?

01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:08.104
I had nothing to do with this.

01:11:24.987 --> 01:11:25.722
What is it?

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:28.825
Who did you tell?

01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:33.329
Excuse me.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.280
I'm sorry. I can't let you in.
Orders.

01:11:50.246 --> 01:11:51.548
I need to talk to my brother.

01:11:54.217 --> 01:11:55.952
Captain Underwood's
been reassigned.

01:11:59.055 --> 01:12:00.290
And Lieutenant Mitchell?

01:12:01.424 --> 01:12:02.159
I don't know.

01:12:18.275 --> 01:12:20.643
- <i>Number, please?</i>
- Foreign Office Archive.

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.312
<i>Putting you through.</i>

01:12:23.179 --> 01:12:24.147
<i>Archive.
How can I help you?</i>

01:12:24.747 --> 01:12:27.250
- Philip Edwards, please.
- <i>One moment, sir.</i>

01:12:28.919 --> 01:12:30.554
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Edwards
is on leave.</i>

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.089
When will he be back?

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:34.390
<i>May I enquire
as to your reason for calling?</i>

01:12:36.893 --> 01:12:37.660
<i>Sir?</i>

01:12:43.198 --> 01:12:45.768
Western Post.
Come and get your Western Post.

01:12:46.603 --> 01:12:48.371
Western Post.
Come and get your Western Post.

01:12:48.504 --> 01:12:49.205
Fresh off the press!

01:12:51.174 --> 01:12:52.209
Thank you, sir.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:58.381
<i>Western Post. Come and get
your Western Post. Fresh off the press!</i>

01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:00.384
<i>Western Post!</i>

01:13:02.152 --> 01:13:03.153
<i>Western Post!</i>

01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:06.456
<i>Come and get your Western Post!
Fresh off the press!</i>

01:13:12.161 --> 01:13:13.229
Mr. Hamilton,
can I talk to you?

01:13:14.964 --> 01:13:18.201
I'm sorry, Stephen, but
you don't work here anymore.

01:13:19.169 --> 01:13:20.304
Excuse me?

01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:25.509
Lovely idea... to give the
festival to the typist.

01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:28.778
You were right.
She shows great promise.

01:13:30.179 --> 01:13:33.217
So that's why she'll be
doing your job from now on.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.022
Now, that's a month's pay.
Clear your desk.

01:13:43.326 --> 01:13:44.361
I have a story.

01:13:45.161 --> 01:13:46.196
I don't want to hear it.

01:13:55.004 --> 01:13:56.839
The British Government
is covering up the murder

01:13:56.973 --> 01:13:59.576
of over 15,000
Polish officers and men...

01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:02.278
by the Soviets in 1940.

01:14:05.214 --> 01:14:06.282
They sold out a whole nation.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.053
Their own allies.

01:14:09.986 --> 01:14:12.089
A country they went to war
to protect.

01:14:12.688 --> 01:14:14.224
And it doesn't end there.

01:14:16.192 --> 01:14:20.230
Yesterday evening, the last witness to
that massacre was murdered right here,

01:14:20.796 --> 01:14:21.698
in Bristol.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.001
Well...

01:14:24.968 --> 01:14:27.204
you certainly have
a vivid imagination.

01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:33.443
What did they say to you, Frank?

01:14:34.244 --> 01:14:35.512
I beg your pardon?!

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.518
That you'd... lose your job?
Lose the paper?

01:14:43.253 --> 01:14:45.522
Huh? Be disgraced?

01:14:47.424 --> 01:14:51.461
That it's your patriotic duty
not to print this?

01:14:54.464 --> 01:14:57.567
If you don't leave right now,
I'll have you thrown out.

01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:04.340
Keep your money. I resign.

01:16:13.309 --> 01:16:14.343
Oh, Mr. Underwood.

01:16:15.312 --> 01:16:18.180
I'll be wanting to redecorate
in the very near future

01:16:18.313 --> 01:16:20.549
so have to ask you
to vacate your room.

01:16:21.384 --> 01:16:24.887
But as I'm not one to throw
anyone onto the street,

01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:29.159
I will of course allow you time to
find suitable alternative lodgings.

01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:33.831
Two weeks should be more than
enough, I'm sure you'll agree?

01:16:35.331 --> 01:16:36.900
And you have a visitor.

01:17:05.394 --> 01:17:07.030
I didn't think
this would happen.

01:17:12.602 --> 01:17:13.570
What did you do?

01:17:17.874 --> 01:17:20.110
Stephen, I just wanted you
to be safe.

01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:23.247
What did you do?

01:17:25.415 --> 01:17:29.420
Mason asked me to watch Loboda
and tell him everything.

01:17:32.655 --> 01:17:33.590
You told him where he was?

01:17:42.398 --> 01:17:44.901
Why didn't you tell me
that Mason wanted him watched?

01:17:46.436 --> 01:17:49.473
I didn't think it would stop you! I
thought it would make things worse!

01:17:50.406 --> 01:17:51.542
Worse?

01:17:54.611 --> 01:17:55.345
He's dead.

01:17:56.412 --> 01:17:58.147
They found him hanging
from a tree.

01:17:59.415 --> 01:18:00.150
I know.

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:03.620
And if I could undo
what I've done, I would.

01:18:05.487 --> 01:18:09.492
I didn't think Mason was capable of
something like this. I still don't.

01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:18.335
What did they do with John?

01:18:21.604 --> 01:18:22.973
They took him to London.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:27.511
You won't be able
to see or speak to him.

01:18:29.545 --> 01:18:31.080
They're posting him
overseas.

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:42.693
I didn't give him these.

01:18:45.495 --> 01:18:46.763
They mean nothing now.

01:18:54.437 --> 01:18:56.606
- I want you to leave.
- Stephen...

01:19:00.043 --> 01:19:01.577
I want you to leave now.

01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:27.604
An inquest before our Sovereign Lord the
King, in the parish of Flax Bourton,

01:19:27.737 --> 01:19:31.975
in the County of Somerset, on this
the third day of November, 1947,

01:19:32.509 --> 01:19:34.945
before one of the coroners
of our said Lord the King,

01:19:35.045 --> 01:19:39.383
for the said County of Somerset,
touching the death of Ivan Krivosertsev,

01:19:39.782 --> 01:19:42.753
known as Michael Loboda,
and upon the view of his body.

01:19:44.853 --> 01:19:46.822
Er, have the witnesses
been sworn in?

01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:48.024
They have, sir.

01:19:48.491 --> 01:19:49.560
Well, let's get going then,
shall we?

01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.330
Were about five, I'd say.

01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:58.402
I was down Long Orchard.
I, er, works there, you see.

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:01.705
And by the rail bridge,

01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:04.407
coming back up
from Court House Farm.

01:20:06.742 --> 01:20:09.278
I sees this gentleman
hanging from a tree.

01:20:12.247 --> 01:20:13.616
<i>Apple tree, it were.</i>

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:24.094
He was hanging about eight feet
up from a leather strap.

01:20:26.929 --> 01:20:30.633
It appeared to me that the deceased
had placed the strap around his neck,

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.437
climbed the tree, secured
the other end to the branch

01:20:35.037 --> 01:20:36.572
and jumped off.

01:20:38.842 --> 01:20:40.811
We untied this and
lowered him to the ground.

01:20:41.777 --> 01:20:44.414
<i>He was already cold. Stiff.</i>

01:20:47.784 --> 01:20:50.652
<i>We searched the body, and
in a wallet we found three letters</i>

01:20:51.588 --> 01:20:53.657
<i>one of which was marked
"Secret Service."</i>

01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:15.644
Carry on.

01:21:16.679 --> 01:21:18.649
We then took him to
the mortuary at Long Ashton.

01:21:21.918 --> 01:21:22.853
I knew him well.

01:21:24.487 --> 01:21:26.723
We had been friends since 1945.

01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:28.858
He was happy.

01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:33.030
He was proud of who he
was, and what he had seen.

01:21:35.165 --> 01:21:38.268
He did drink a lot, but he
could stand a lot as well.

01:21:40.603 --> 01:21:43.774
I do not know any reason
why he should hang himself.

01:21:46.842 --> 01:21:47.878
He wouldn't do this.

01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:03.860
May it duly be recorded here,
on presentation

01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:07.397
of all inquiries under oath,

01:22:07.897 --> 01:22:11.934
that I, as appointed coroner
of the County of Somerset

01:22:12.034 --> 01:22:14.336
by the office of
His Majesty the King,

01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:18.407
on deliberating the probable cause
of death of Michael Loboda,

01:22:18.508 --> 01:22:21.278
also known as
Ivan Krivosertsev,

01:22:22.379 --> 01:22:25.015
do allege a verdict
of suicide...

01:22:26.715 --> 01:22:27.784
by hanging.

01:22:30.686 --> 01:22:33.723
These proceedings
are duly closed.

01:22:46.536 --> 01:22:47.938
Surely you're not
going to accept that.

01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:49.738
I have to accept it.

01:22:50.039 --> 01:22:52.776
This is now just another suicide
that no one will want to hear about.

01:22:52.909 --> 01:22:54.576
What about the letters
in his wallet?

01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:56.847
We have not been allowed
to see them.

01:22:57.979 --> 01:22:58.948
Why weren't they read out?

01:22:59.749 --> 01:23:01.351
I'm very sorry, Mr. Underwood,

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:04.186
but maybe if you'd not become involved,
there would be no need to know.

01:23:04.987 --> 01:23:09.592
Look, Colonel, I'm sorry but
I did what I thought was right.

01:23:11.093 --> 01:23:12.763
Did you? Really?

01:23:13.897 --> 01:23:14.930
We still have this.

01:23:15.764 --> 01:23:17.800
Testimony is worth nothing
without the man.

01:23:19.802 --> 01:23:22.005
Even if it's not
accepted in the courts,

01:23:22.872 --> 01:23:24.840
it still brings the story
out into the open.

01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:28.577
- That's all you need, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Underwood, but there's nothing more I can do.

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:30.947
We have been told
in no uncertain terms

01:23:31.046 --> 01:23:33.715
that the newspapers
have been strongly advised

01:23:33.816 --> 01:23:35.018
never to raise
the subject again.

01:23:36.619 --> 01:23:38.054
My apologies, I have to go.

01:23:41.023 --> 01:23:44.260
He did not deserve this.
He was a good man.

01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:55.005
I'm so very sorry,
Colonel.

01:23:56.238 --> 01:23:57.240
I truly am.

01:24:07.116 --> 01:24:08.851
Don't you dare
walk away from me!

01:24:09.985 --> 01:24:12.988
You are just as much to blame
for this impossible situation!

01:24:14.022 --> 01:24:15.858
You did
what you thought was right.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.295
And so did I.

01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:21.897
This is not finished.

01:27:59.214 --> 01:28:01.950
<i>In that moment,
when Stephen died,</i>

01:28:02.050 --> 01:28:03.887
<i>my life was changed forever.</i>

01:28:05.054 --> 01:28:08.858
<i>Everything I had believed in ws shattered
by the revelations he had uncovered</i>

01:28:09.192 --> 01:28:11.828
<i>and I was determined
to finish what he had started;</i>

01:28:13.228 --> 01:28:15.197
<i>to finally print Stephen's story</i>

01:28:15.298 --> 01:28:17.066
<i>and the testimony
of Michael Loboda,</i>

01:28:17.198 --> 01:28:19.568
<i>the last witness
to the countless Polish soldies</i>

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:21.104
<i>who had died at Katyn,</i>

01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:24.139
<i>whatever the risks
and however long it would take.</i>

01:28:25.107 --> 01:28:26.142
<i>They would not be forgotten,</i>

01:28:27.043 --> 01:28:28.143
<i>and their testimony
would live on.</i>
