00:01.392 --> 00:03.046
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.221
Mr. Olsen is stable.

00:04.265 --> 00:05.614
Who is the next of kin?

00:05.657 --> 00:08.051
I'm Kelly Olsen,
James' sister.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.010
If we don't help him,
James is gonna die.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.229
You're asking me to work
with you to save him?

00:12.273 --> 00:14.710
I can save
both you and him.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.190
You have to be just like her.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.713
Move like her, think like her.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.848
Promote peace, my son.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.289
If you don't
stand up and fight,
you'll lose everything.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.817
I am not a man of peace.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.993
Otis, find me a real American.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.255
Someone charismatic.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.778
I think I know just the guy.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.216
Name's Ben Lockwood.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.260
Miss Tessmacher!

00:44.609 --> 00:46.046
Eve.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.619
Lena.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.667
She's alive.
Get the EMTs up here now.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.934
Director, there's a letter.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.764
It's from Lex Luthor.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.201
Stay with her.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.033
"Dear Lena,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.339
I wish I could say
it wasn't personal

01:18.382 --> 01:20.254
planting a spy,
stealing your research,

01:20.297 --> 01:21.733
but it is."

01:21.777 --> 01:24.345
Lex was working
with Eve Tessmacher.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.564
-Oh, my God.
-She's coming to.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.351
Lena, hey, are you okay?

01:30.394 --> 01:32.004
-I think so.
-Look at me.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.268
Alex.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.445
Alex, I've got to tell you
about Lex.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.099
He escaped from prison,
he attacked you,

01:39.142 --> 01:40.404
and he stole your research,
we know.

01:40.448 --> 01:43.146
No, that's not
the whole story--

01:43.190 --> 01:45.453
Hey, uh-uh, don't move.

01:45.496 --> 01:48.456
And, yes, we know
that Eve was his spy.

01:50.632 --> 01:53.156
Yes, but I gotta tell you--

01:53.200 --> 01:54.766
You've been through trauma.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.378
So, please, just try to relax.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.207
I'm sorry.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.297
You have nothing
to apologize for.

02:03.340 --> 02:06.082
Supergirl is searching for Lex.
She will find him.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.350
I checked
the whole South Pacific.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.309
No sign of Lex
or his helicopter.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.880
Kal left me here
to protect Earth

02:21.924 --> 02:24.492
and I let his archnemesis
slip through my fingers.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.670
Everything that Lex does now
is because I failed.

02:31.281 --> 02:34.937
I'm gonna cast a psychic net.
I might be able to detect them.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.158
J'onn...

02:38.897 --> 02:40.160
-J'onn?

02:52.476 --> 02:55.827
J'onn, are you okay? J'onn!

03:03.226 --> 03:04.184
Thank you for saving me.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.708
Why do you think this happened?

03:06.751 --> 03:08.188
I told you the other night...

03:10.364 --> 03:12.279
I am no longer a man of peace.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.109
When I took Manchester's life,

03:17.153 --> 03:21.113
I realized that I was done
trying to be my father.

03:21.157 --> 03:25.335
But now that I have clarity
as to who I am not,

03:25.379 --> 03:29.731
I no longer have clarity
as to who I am.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.255
You think that caused you
to lose your powers?

03:32.299 --> 03:35.476
There is an ancient story
about a race of shapeshifters

03:37.608 --> 03:40.089
whose planet was destroyed.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.308
They had to

03:41.351 --> 03:43.745
constantly change shape
to survive.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.616
For generations, they did this.

03:45.660 --> 03:49.229
Until, one day,
they forgot their true form...

03:52.275 --> 03:53.537
and all that goes with it.

03:53.581 --> 03:59.108
History, culture,
all sense of self.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.893
They even forgot
the name of their race.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.246
I am a shapeshifter, too, Kara.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.466
The same thing
could happen to me.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.251
There must be something
we can do.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.262
I heard my father's voice
when I fell.

04:25.003 --> 04:28.311
The Staff of K'hollar
was with him when he died.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.531
Maybe I could use its power

04:30.574 --> 04:32.359
to summon his spirit
for counsel.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.800
No.

04:38.843 --> 04:42.020
Lex is out there.
I need to help you find him.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.546
No, no, you are always helping
everyone around you.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.722
Right now, you just need
to take care of yourself.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.951
They dress their patients

04:59.995 --> 05:03.085
in business attire
in this hospital?

05:03.128 --> 05:05.043
That's funny.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.654
No, actually,
I got a clean bill of health

05:06.697 --> 05:08.351
from the docs
about an hour ago, so...

05:08.395 --> 05:09.570
Why didn't you call me?

05:09.613 --> 05:11.049
'Cause you'd have
wanted to take me home.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
And the world
has turned upside down

05:13.356 --> 05:14.357
since I've been here,

05:14.401 --> 05:16.403
so I need to get to work. So...

05:22.409 --> 05:23.453
James, are you okay?

05:23.497 --> 05:26.238
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

05:26.282 --> 05:29.546
You were shot. You almost died
on the operating table.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.852
Look, this isn't a broken leg.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.419
You need to pay attention
to what's going on.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.291
Kelly, I said I'm fine.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.511
I'm a psychologist
that specializes in trauma.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.948
This is my job.

05:39.991 --> 05:44.518
And my job is to cover
the Alien Amnesty repeal.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.954
There are thousands
of Americans,

05:45.997 --> 05:47.434
the government's trying
to take away their rights,

05:47.477 --> 05:50.393
and nobody's paying attention
because Lex is out there.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.874
I just need to make sure that
people know what's going on.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.484
So I need to get to work,
I'll call you later.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.188
How long do you think
it's gonna take them
to find Lex Luthor this time?

06:03.232 --> 06:06.453
Find Lex... Oh, no, no, no,
put your phone down, son.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.369
What we're doing here,
this is the real news.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.501
We are making history.

06:11.545 --> 06:12.937
Mr. Lockwood,

06:12.981 --> 06:14.591
Senator Granberry's office
just called,

06:14.635 --> 06:15.853
can you stop by there today?

06:17.725 --> 06:20.641
Tell her I'll be right there.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.643
What do you say, son,
you want to watch
another senator

06:22.686 --> 06:25.036
tell your father
how he's doing good work?

06:26.211 --> 06:27.561
It's pretty cool.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.608
- Breach of protocol.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.349
It's a perimeter breach.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.220
Stay sharp.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.918
It could be Lex Luthor.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.049
Supergirl?

06:38.093 --> 06:39.442
What does she want?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.270
I forgot how loud those were.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.315
-Everyone, stand down.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.795
I, uh...

06:44.839 --> 06:47.624
I come offering donuts
and my help.

06:50.061 --> 06:53.630
Lex usually attacks within
the first 48 hours of escaping.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.980
Now, I know we've had
our differences,

06:56.024 --> 06:58.113
but I think we should team up
to catch him.

06:58.156 --> 07:01.638
While I do appreciate a good
cinnamon cruller, Supergirl,

07:01.682 --> 07:04.815
the President has ordered us
to redirect manpower
to Washington, D.C.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.295
For security.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.689
In case of any unrest
after the repeal vote.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.734
So, who's looking for Lex?

07:10.778 --> 07:14.477
FBI, CIA, US Marshals.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.001
I believe SEAL Teams
one through six.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.960
Everyone but us.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.310
Lex had superpowers
when I fought him.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.530
He is more dangerous
than ever,
and he will strike.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.183
Maybe I can help Supergirl.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.881
With support from Agent Dox,

07:26.924 --> 07:29.579
I can direct the D.C. operation
from the field.

07:29.623 --> 07:33.017
No, I can run point on D.C.,

07:33.061 --> 07:34.715
cover where necessary.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.412
You focus on finding Lex.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.808
Don't make me regret this.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.900
I've been doing
scans of the skies,

07:45.943 --> 07:47.510
but I'm not finding anything.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.295
But most criminal organizations
have a weak link.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.427
You're right.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.820
Eve Tessmacher
was working with Lex.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.604
Lena knows her
better than any of us.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.215
-Let's go talk to her.
-Um...

07:57.259 --> 07:59.653
Lena has been through
quite the ordeal.

07:59.696 --> 08:03.091
And given the fact that
you two don't have
the cleanest history,

08:03.134 --> 08:04.658
I think it's better
if I talk to her.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.966
Right.

08:09.010 --> 08:12.753
Uh, if she gives you a lead,

08:12.796 --> 08:15.407
press this once
and I'll be there.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.931
You press it twice,
I'll know not to come.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.588
Nia is at the fortress

08:21.631 --> 08:23.677
trying to dream up
what Lex's plan might be,

08:23.720 --> 08:25.505
but so far nothing.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.550
We'll keep a secret
communication open with her

08:27.594 --> 08:28.682
in case she's successful.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.292
Oh, oh, I almost forgot.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.120
J'onn wanted me
to give this back to you.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.819
Ah.

08:35.863 --> 08:39.780
I can't tell you how much
it means to have this back.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.521
-Thank you.
-Keep it close.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.957
You never know
when you might need it.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.372
We're closed.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
Can't you read the sign?

09:14.336 --> 09:15.772
It's on the door.

09:15.816 --> 09:16.773
The sign.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.384
Damn sign.

09:19.428 --> 09:20.951
It says we're closed!

09:20.995 --> 09:23.606
Ah, J'onn, my son.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.568
Let's have a little chat,
shall we?

09:39.404 --> 09:42.625
This is a very nice office.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.889
It reminds me

09:45.933 --> 09:49.937
of the library at
the University of Z'onn Z'orr.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.026
You're here.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.767
I don't believe it.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.507
Weren't you trying
to contact me?

09:55.551 --> 09:59.947
Yes, but I thought
I might hear a voice or feel...

10:01.078 --> 10:02.645
a presence, I didn't...

10:04.081 --> 10:05.648
think you'd actually...

10:07.650 --> 10:08.695
be here.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.696
I am.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.875
I'm so glad.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.485
I'm so glad.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.487
I've been so lost.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.316
So, so confused
about my identity.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.361
I, I tried to follow
your example.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.146
I really tried to follow.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.930
I studied the Sacred Symbols,

10:26.974 --> 10:29.106
I, I counseled everybody,

10:29.150 --> 10:32.327
everybody to be peaceful.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.764
But it just didn't work.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.158
And, and, now,
I'm at an impasse.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.900
I... please...
I need guidance.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.684
That's not why I'm here.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.512
Then what, why did you come?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.296
Because you failed.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.343
You were supposed
to be the keeper
of the Sacred Symbols.

10:48.386 --> 10:49.736
A holy man, a man of peace,

10:49.779 --> 10:51.694
but you said you are
not a man of peace,

10:51.738 --> 10:53.740
so I've come
to take the Symbols back.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.699
If you take the Sacred Symbols,

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
Martian history
will disappear forever.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.269
Hmm, a shame.
I'm taking them now.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.271
No wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.665
Well, you can't.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.189
They're inside my mind.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.277
No.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.019
They're here on the table.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.591
-Goodbye.
-No, no, wait.

11:19.635 --> 11:22.594
Wait...

11:22.638 --> 11:24.858
We interrupt our coverage
of the Alien Amnesty repeal

11:24.901 --> 11:26.773
with an update on the manhunt
for Lex Luthor.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.905
Sources say his sister,
Lena Luthor, is a victim.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.820
Authorities found Ms. Luthor
late last night

11:30.864 --> 11:32.387
in her office,
drugged and bound.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.997
Lex Luthor is considered
extremely dangerous

11:34.041 --> 11:36.130
and any information should be immediately reported.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.832
Lena, I wasn't expecting you.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.793
All the reports say you were
knocked unconscious.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.752
You were always prone
to migraines.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.754
Is your head okay?

11:51.798 --> 11:53.669
Spare me
the concerned mother act.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.671
Just tell me where Lex is.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.109
Do you have to be so emotional?

11:59.153 --> 12:01.068
It's disappointing.

12:01.111 --> 12:05.289
I know you're upset
that Lex outsmarted you.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.074
He hurt your poor little heart.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.684
Well, at least, I have a heart.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.207
An overrated organ.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.906
Romanticized by poets

12:14.037 --> 12:15.343
and frivolous women.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.041
You're no better than simpering
Eve Tessmacher

12:18.085 --> 12:20.609
chasing Lex like
a lovesick puppy.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.743
So Eve is in love with Lex.

12:23.786 --> 12:27.442
Your brother gave you every
opportunity to work with him.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.662
To come back into the fold,
and you turned him down.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.448
I will never be on
the same side as you and Lex.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.667
Of course not.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.932
The only side you'll ever be on
is the side of your friends.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.325
The Danvers sisters,

12:41.369 --> 12:42.805
Jimmy Olsen.

12:42.849 --> 12:46.853
Oh, what those besties
would think

12:46.896 --> 12:49.812
if they knew what
you've really been up to.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.206
Ah.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.730
I can only imagine
what went down.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
Weeks helping Lex.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.998
Recrafting the drug you claimed
would save humanity.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.783
To save him.

13:06.002 --> 13:09.397
The two of you working
side by side.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.882
I can smell your fear, Lena.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.971
Doing everything in your power
to make sure

13:18.014 --> 13:21.322
your friends never
find out your complicity.

13:21.365 --> 13:24.064
They would hate you.

13:24.107 --> 13:27.067
And then you'd find yourself
utterly alone.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.330
Again.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.548
This is foolish.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.900
You don't know anything.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.858
Because Lex has deserted you.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.469
I may be in prison,

13:38.513 --> 13:41.037
but I'm not the one
who's going to be deserted.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.055
Hey, there you are.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
I went to look for you
at the hospital,

14:00.752 --> 14:02.885
but they said you already left.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
I got better.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.716
I thought the FBI had already
gone through this.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.935
Have you changed
your mind about me?

14:08.978 --> 14:10.153
No, of course not.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.851
I came to ask for your help.

14:14.723 --> 14:15.855
I'm sorry.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.074
It's been a day.

14:18.118 --> 14:21.034
Well, I have been tasked
with tracking down Lex.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.340
And I'd like to ask you
about Eve Tessmacher.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.081
You're gonna use Eve
to get to Lex.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.256
I think she's the weak link.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.128
I want in on the investigation.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.564
Lena, you were just assaulted.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.001
Yeah, and I'm not a cop,
but I know Eve.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.265
Okay.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.615
But you should know that
I'm working with Supergirl
on this.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.143
Finding Lex is more important
than any differences
we may have.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.927
-Yeah.
-I know just where to start.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.020
So this is the team.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.456
Yes, Lena has joined us.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.980
Uh, so why are we in 'burbs?

14:54.023 --> 14:56.678
Well, I realized that Eve
is in love with Lex.

14:56.721 --> 14:57.984
Crazy Lex-girlfriend.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.986
Which indicates her heart
drives her actions.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.902
And she spoke fondly
of an elderly aunt,

15:02.945 --> 15:04.077
her only family in the city.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.948
Mary Tessmacher.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.036
This is her house.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.298
Eve used to visit every Sunday.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.213
So Eve might still be
in contact with her.

15:11.084 --> 15:11.998
Good lead.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.787
Can I help you ladies?

15:21.355 --> 15:22.399
Thank you very much.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.793
Senator Granberry,
good to see you.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.055
Thanks for coming.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.230
This is your son.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.145
George Lockwood, ma'am.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.974
I was just giving him an intro
on how things get done
in Washington.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.323
As a matter of fact,
we were just talking about

15:33.367 --> 15:35.282
how this repeal is moving
even faster

15:35.325 --> 15:37.023
than the Homestead Act of...

15:37.806 --> 15:38.720
1862.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.113
1862.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.941
I've changed my mind.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.246
I'm not voting for the repeal.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.249
Excuse me? What?

15:46.293 --> 15:47.903
Uh, okay.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.036
But if...

15:50.079 --> 15:52.255
If you vote no, then your
block's gonna vote no,

15:52.299 --> 15:55.476
and that's eight votes
we'll lose.

15:55.519 --> 15:58.044
If we suddenly strip rights
from powerful aliens,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.393
how are they gonna react?

15:59.436 --> 16:00.960
Badly.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.571
If they protest, revolt,
and we have a war on our hands,

16:03.614 --> 16:04.920
then that is bad for humans.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.443
I understand,
you're acting out of fear.

16:06.487 --> 16:10.273
But maybe, just maybe
you should fear the common man.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.232
Agent Liberty may play
to your steel town base,

16:12.275 --> 16:13.494
but not here.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.278
Welcome to Washington.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.722
You're awake.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.464
You're still here.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.599
How is this even possible?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.862
I only stayed
because you fainted.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.124
Now that you've
regained consciousness,

16:35.168 --> 16:36.386
I'm going.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.214
Wait,
you can't just leave.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.955
After everything
we went through,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.696
for you to pass
the Symbols onto me--

16:41.739 --> 16:43.176
You can imagine
how disappointed I was

16:43.219 --> 16:44.699
when you resorted to violence.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.135
That's why I was
trying to contact you.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.399
I need your help.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.227
I'm trying to...

16:53.186 --> 16:56.015
I'm trying to figure out
who I'm supposed to be.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.365
The easiest question
in the world.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.236
What's the answer?

17:00.280 --> 17:01.107
For you?

17:02.282 --> 17:03.152
No idea.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.762
You figure it out.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.068
I ask you for help
and all you do

17:06.112 --> 17:07.939
is turn up
and you make it worse.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.770
I'm the last Green Martian.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.077
If I lose myself,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.166
we not only lose
Martian religion,

17:17.949 --> 17:19.299
we lose everything.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.085
Our entire history.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.741
Every memory you ever gave me.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.136
My wife.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.225
My daughters.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.400
So this is urgent.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.055
Yeah.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.100
Oh, yeah.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.277
I know what will
solve this problem.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.409
What? What? What?

17:42.452 --> 17:44.541
A nice hot cup of c'off'ee.

17:46.282 --> 17:47.370
What?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.285
I'll stay for one.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.164
Oh, Mary's in Florida
soaking up the rays,

17:58.207 --> 18:00.079
and I'm plant sitting.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.384
Is Mary in
some kind of trouble?

18:01.428 --> 18:02.820
No, uh, not at all.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.474
We're just here
because of her niece, Eve.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.302
Do you know her?

18:06.346 --> 18:08.870
Well, she's my fave cousin
and bowling bud
at the fam reunion.

18:08.913 --> 18:12.134
There's no way she's really
involved with that Lex Luthor.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.788
-He's a creeper.
-What was your name again?

18:13.831 --> 18:15.137
Bitsie, with an I-E.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.921
Do you have
any daughters, Bitsie?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.227
Yes, twins.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.446
They're at camp.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.317
I miss those little chipmunks.

18:21.361 --> 18:22.666
When was the last time
you saw Eve?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.581
Months ago.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.628
Oh, unless you count
seeing her gorgeous mug
splashed across the news.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.369
She always said
how amazing it was

18:29.412 --> 18:30.718
to work for you, Ms. Luthor.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.635
Were you sick at all, Bitsie?

18:34.678 --> 18:37.159
Me? Healthy as a horse. Why?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.682
Uh, just something Eve
said about a cousin

18:38.726 --> 18:40.380
with cancer
who had two daughters.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.165
My blood orange cake.
Want some?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.558
I can never turn down cake.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.776
She's lying.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.387
Her heart's as fast
as a hummingbird's.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.692
Yeah, I think so too.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.652
Uh, Bitsie, your... Your hands.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.133
Oh, ow!

18:54.176 --> 18:55.612
Ahhh!

18:55.656 --> 18:58.180
Your hands should be scalded,
they're not even red.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.573
You were sick.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.183
You were on hospice.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.359
Eve cured you with the serum
I made for James.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.187
She was here.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.234
I want you
out of my aunt's house!

19:10.279 --> 19:11.933
I drink a lot of milk?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.544
-Oh.
-Drop it.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.893
You can't take it out of me.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.243
I don't want to be sick again.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.374
It's okay. It's okay.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.985
Hey, we are not here
to hurt you.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.292
Eve saved me. She's good.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.641
I hear you.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.426
But if the world
is wrong about Eve,

19:26.469 --> 19:28.167
then tell us what's right.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.691
Eve came here
when she was on the run
from you and the police.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.736
She risked getting caught
to help me.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.435
She did a good thing for you.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.959
But the longer she's with Lex,
the more trouble she's in,

19:38.002 --> 19:39.656
and the more danger.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.136
Help us find her.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.448
I don't know where she went.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.625
But I know she used to
work out of a lab
at National City University.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.409
Eve had a secret lab?

19:53.453 --> 19:55.194
Seems there are a lot of things
about Eve that were secret.

19:56.020 --> 19:56.804
This way...

19:59.372 --> 20:01.200
Ah. A-ha!

20:02.331 --> 20:05.465
Okay, when you get the signal,

20:05.508 --> 20:09.208
go that way exactly 900 meters.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.384
I speak English
better than you.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.299
Whatever. It's not a contest.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.691
And put this on first.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.348
What?

20:19.392 --> 20:21.394
You really look
exactly like her.

20:28.357 --> 20:34.189
Wow, I could fit
ten of my apartments
into this office.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.278
Yeah,
it's not bad, huh?

20:37.410 --> 20:38.324
What you got there?

20:40.326 --> 20:43.416
Referrals for
post-trauma psychologists.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.721
All in National City.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.245
Come on. Come, look...

20:46.288 --> 20:48.638
Look, Kelly, I told you,
I don't need help.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.857
I don't need help.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.686
James, Lex tried to kill you
eight times.

20:52.729 --> 20:56.037
If you would just listen to me
for once in your life,

20:56.080 --> 20:59.997
maybe you would realize
this has nothing to do
with Lex.

21:00.041 --> 21:03.131
James, you have a wall
full of televisions
and they're all off.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.612
Because you know that
if you turn them on,

21:05.655 --> 21:07.222
you'll see Lex's face
staring back at you.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.093
-Oh, is that right?
-You are avoiding a trigger.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.357
Lex came after me
in the first place

21:11.400 --> 21:13.184
to get to Superman

21:13.228 --> 21:14.708
who's off planet.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.537
Manchester Black shot me,
who's dead now,

21:17.580 --> 21:20.322
so I'm no longer in danger,
thank you.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.803
But you are irritable,
jumpy, sweaty,

21:22.846 --> 21:24.935
all psychological responses
to triggers.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.981
And those are just the symptoms
that I can see.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.026
God forbid
you have a flashback.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.638
'Cause I know
you'd never tell me.

21:31.681 --> 21:32.682
Wow.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.295
You know,

21:36.338 --> 21:38.819
you're not the only one
who can analyze things, Kelly.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.082
The only times
that you've come to visit me

21:41.125 --> 21:43.519
are when I was in the hospital.

21:43.563 --> 21:46.130
Because I was weak
and you could tell me
what to do, right?

21:46.174 --> 21:47.349
James, I'm just trying to help.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.090
Then help me by listen...

21:51.440 --> 21:52.572
I'm sorry.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.011
I should, I...

21:57.054 --> 21:59.970
I'm just, I'm busy,
I'm overwhelmed, I'm just...

22:02.451 --> 22:03.931
This, this is, uh...

22:06.412 --> 22:08.414
This is probably a really
good time for you to go home.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.528
Whole room's lined with lead.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.618
Eve may not have been tidy,
but she was smart.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.054
Maybe not that smart.

22:51.326 --> 22:52.371
That's Harun-El.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.243
Yes. It is.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.419
You kept this?

22:57.463 --> 22:59.378
My mother told you
how dangerous it is.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.944
I didn't keep it.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.077
I gave your mother what I had,
but I made more

23:03.120 --> 23:04.861
so I could realize
its potential.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.950
All of my current research
is based on this.

23:06.994 --> 23:09.649
This is how Lex had powers.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.607
Is that a part
of your research, too?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.435
This is why I didn't
want to work with you.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.568
Because every time
I think things are
getting better with us,

23:15.611 --> 23:17.874
you display an inherent
distrust of my intentions.

23:17.918 --> 23:21.051
What is so wrong about helping
humans protect themselves?

23:21.095 --> 23:23.532
Because someone like Lex could
get ahold of the technology

23:23.576 --> 23:25.621
and use it for evil,
which is exactly what happened.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.536
You look past all of the good
we've done

23:27.580 --> 23:29.538
and see red whenever
you feel vulnerable.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.845
Lena saved Argo
with this.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.150
She rescued Sam,

23:33.194 --> 23:34.935
she cured Bitsie's cancer,

23:34.978 --> 23:37.067
and she saved James' life.

23:42.812 --> 23:43.813
You're right.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.339
-Excuse me?
- You're right.

23:48.383 --> 23:51.212
If you hadn't made Harun-El,
James wouldn't be alive,

23:51.255 --> 23:53.344
and you saved him
in a way I couldn't.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.913
I do see red sometimes,

23:56.957 --> 24:00.308
and it's not an ego thing
or allegiance,

24:00.351 --> 24:01.614
or anything like that.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.488
I feel the weight of the world
on my shoulders.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.970
And since Superman left,
and Lex has been free,

24:11.101 --> 24:12.494
it feels a lot heavier.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.236
If my enemies are strengthened,

24:15.279 --> 24:17.281
if I'm weakened
in the slightest bit,

24:17.325 --> 24:18.195
I could lose.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.588
And I just can't...

24:20.546 --> 24:21.982
I can't lose.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.683
I'm sorry, Lena.

24:32.688 --> 24:33.515
Thank you.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.171
I appreciate that.

24:40.696 --> 24:41.915
Bygones?

24:44.352 --> 24:45.353
Bygones.

24:46.963 --> 24:47.964
So what's the answer?

24:48.008 --> 24:50.097
H'ronmeer save me. This again?

24:50.140 --> 24:51.751
I need guidance.
Why won't you help me?

24:51.794 --> 24:53.187
Why should I?

24:53.230 --> 24:56.059
I'm not the one who failed
at the one task I have.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.150
Or was it another Green Martian

25:00.194 --> 25:02.501
who erased the mind
of the DEO colonel,

25:02.544 --> 25:06.853
who reached
into Manchester Black's brain
to inflict pain upon him,

25:06.896 --> 25:09.508
and opened a channel for him
to access your mind

25:09.551 --> 25:11.727
so he could defile
my grave site

25:11.771 --> 25:14.208
and steal
the Staff of K'hollar,

25:14.251 --> 25:16.993
which he could've
used to destroy planet Earth?

25:17.037 --> 25:20.736
Everything I did,
I did in the name of peace.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.825
-You killed him.
-He was a killer.

25:22.869 --> 25:23.739
Then so are you.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.742
Well, what would you
have me do?

25:26.786 --> 25:28.352
Sit around and pray all day

25:28.396 --> 25:31.268
while the world around me burns
like you did on Mars?

25:32.052 --> 25:33.706
At least I didn't run.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.275
I have been trying
to make up for that.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.714
By protecting this planet.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.367
Trying

25:43.977 --> 25:46.109
and failing.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.721
If I'm such a failure,
why did you trust me
with the Symbols?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.461
Because you said
you could handle it.

25:50.505 --> 25:51.724
You insisted--

25:51.767 --> 25:52.768
I shouldn't have!

25:53.943 --> 25:56.642
I tried to be you, Father,
but I can't!

25:57.947 --> 25:59.558
And you should
never have asked me.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.736
I'm not a man of peace!

26:05.520 --> 26:07.783
And if that means I have
to give up the Symbols,

26:07.827 --> 26:10.612
and Martian religion
has to die, then so be it.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.310
At least I will know who I am!

26:17.663 --> 26:19.621
And who are you?

26:19.665 --> 26:22.145
I'm the Martian Manhunter!

26:29.152 --> 26:30.240
Yes.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.156
You are.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.821
The blueprints
to my mother's prison.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.868
Ugh, okay,
did Eve ever mention,
like, a family pet?

26:48.911 --> 26:49.782
Um...

26:50.652 --> 26:52.045
Here.

26:52.088 --> 26:54.613
-"I love Lex"?

26:54.656 --> 26:55.875
Gross.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.050
Truly.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.008
All right,
let's see what Eve was up to.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.315
Uh...

27:01.358 --> 27:02.664
Is that
her experiment log?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.579
Looks like she was trying
to extract my serum

27:04.623 --> 27:05.754
from someone after treatment.

27:08.888 --> 27:09.845
Look at this.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.630
It's a Cadmus-13.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.066
It's the same type of gun
that shot James.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.026
Oh, Metallo Protocol.

27:17.070 --> 27:20.682
Lex and Eve were trying to use
Cadmus' Metallo technology.

27:20.726 --> 27:24.512
And look whose name
is on the test subject list.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.209
Otis Graves.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.907
That must be how they
brought him back to life.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.648
Well,
he wasn't the first one.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.128
Looks like there were
five failed test subjects
before him.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.608
What do you think
happened to them?

27:49.755 --> 27:50.669
-Alex, no!

27:54.977 --> 27:57.588
I'll distract him
and you make a run for it.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.634
No, the Kryptonite
will kill you.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.288
I should've brought grenades.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.507
I think I can make one
with some help
from your stun gun.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.508
Go!

28:25.791 --> 28:27.314
Hey, Franken Berry.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.335
Not donuts, I presume.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.510
No, don't, don't.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.251
That's a Kryptonite heart.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.123
It was used to reanimate
the second Metallo.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.429
And the first.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.257
And possibly Otis.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.824
Much better than donuts.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.174
Wait, Eve Tessmacher was
working with Otis Graves,

29:01.217 --> 29:03.916
and Otis Graves was working
with Agent Liberty, correct?

29:03.959 --> 29:06.657
So even Lex might have
a connection to Ben Lockwood.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.616
Well, transitive
property strikes again.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.487
I need to have a chat
with Lockwood.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.707
See what his connection
to Eve and Lex might be.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.926
I'll talk to Lillian.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.231
It's the last thing I wanna do,

29:15.275 --> 29:17.277
but she gave me some info
on Otis a while ago,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.670
and she always knows
more than she says.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.629
Before you go,

29:21.672 --> 29:23.979
they ran a ballistics test
on the Cadmus-13 gun
you found in Eve's lab.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.201
It's a definite match
to the bullet that shot James.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.204
Eve shot James?

29:31.247 --> 29:34.076
Which means that Lex
was behind this, as well.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.121
But why?

29:36.992 --> 29:38.951
Just when you think
you've got to the bottom
of Eve's betrayal,

29:38.994 --> 29:40.561
it gets deeper and deeper.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.737
James deserves to know
who shot him.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.565
That his attacker's
still out there.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.393
I'll tell him
before I go to D.C.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.744
We will find Eve.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.659
I promise.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.792
You tricked me
into getting angry.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.098
You were angry already.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.839
Just pushing it down.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.974
And you were right
to be angry with me, J'onn,

30:02.017 --> 30:03.497
I wasn't clear.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.891
I said I wished
for you to promote peace,

30:05.934 --> 30:08.023
but I never intended
for you to become me.

30:09.633 --> 30:12.680
I meant only that
you should help the world

30:12.723 --> 30:14.943
in whatever state
is true to you.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.207
When I found you again,

30:18.251 --> 30:21.950
I was so proud of the Martian
you had become.

30:21.994 --> 30:25.954
I never meant to make you feel
you had to change, J'onn.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.479
I'm sorry.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.656
I failed to impart my
unconditional love for you.

30:38.924 --> 30:42.841
I'm so sorry
I couldn't be the keeper
of the Sacred Symbols, Father.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.017
Hmm.

30:45.060 --> 30:49.151
You were able to keep
the Symbols alive
a little longer.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.501
That brought comfort
to an old Martian.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.244
The important thing is,

30:56.202 --> 30:58.030
you know who you are.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.950
Maybe there's another way.

31:04.993 --> 31:09.911
H'ronmeer gave us the Symbols
in the heart of the desert
of T'ozz.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.870
I could return them there.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.350
A hard journey.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.832
And if you succeed,
they will lie dormant

31:17.876 --> 31:20.269
until someone worthy
comes to claim them.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.622
Maybe somebody will.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.189
Hmm.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.637
Thank you, Father,
for all your help.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.596
You know, J'onn,

31:42.639 --> 31:45.512
I'm just an extension
of your memory of me.

31:47.296 --> 31:49.777
Any answers you found,

31:49.820 --> 31:51.866
they came from inside you.

31:52.649 --> 31:53.868
Yeah, I know.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.569
But it was still
really good to see you.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.615
It was good to see you, too...

32:03.660 --> 32:05.488
Martian Manhunter.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.773
Hey.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.253
How's the hunt for Eve coming?

32:33.734 --> 32:34.953
Well, um,

32:36.084 --> 32:38.478
we found out she revived Otis,

32:38.521 --> 32:40.001
which connects her
to Ben Lockwood,

32:40.045 --> 32:43.178
so I am going to D.C. now
to question him.

32:43.222 --> 32:47.008
So Lockwood and Luthor
may be connected?

32:47.052 --> 32:49.228
We think. But, uh...

32:49.271 --> 32:52.231
That's actually not the reason
I came to talk to you.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.325
We found a gun in Eve's lab.

32:59.368 --> 33:03.024
The DEO matched the bullets
to the one you were shot with.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.246
Manchester Black
didn't shoot you, James.

33:08.247 --> 33:09.509
It was Eve.

33:15.645 --> 33:19.040
So that means
Lex is behind this, too.

33:20.781 --> 33:21.869
Did you see?

33:22.913 --> 33:24.698
The Alien Amnesty Act
was just repealed.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.526
What?

33:26.569 --> 33:29.094
...to repeal
the Alien Amnesty Act.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.835
I'm sure some of you
are surprised,

33:31.879 --> 33:33.185
-but I can assure you...
- Eve.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.447
Did you see that?

33:35.230 --> 33:36.971
That was Eve.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.233
She's in D.C.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.198
That was quick.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.982
Your friends
betray you already?

33:50.158 --> 33:51.159
No, Mother.

33:52.813 --> 33:53.814
I came to give you this.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.344
The blueprints to the prison?

34:02.388 --> 34:03.780
Lex was coming for you.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.652
I hate to say I told you so.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.740
Really?

34:08.350 --> 34:10.091
'Cause I just love saying it.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.442
Look at your cell, Mother.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.405
Do you see your name, Mother?

34:19.448 --> 34:22.451
Written in red,
in Lex's handwriting.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.279
We both know what that means.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.454
No.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.586
He wouldn't.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.283
Lex was coming for you.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.199
But not to free you.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.070
To murder you.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.899
The question is, Mother,

34:35.943 --> 34:38.206
why would he bother
to come and kill you?

34:39.207 --> 34:41.514
Unless you knew something.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.298
Something that could be used
to find him?

34:46.475 --> 34:48.260
So who are you gonna
bet your life on?

34:49.304 --> 34:50.653
The psychopath...

34:51.524 --> 34:52.612
or me?

34:54.048 --> 34:57.704
The only person who can
or will protect you.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.582
You can tell me what you know
when you're ready.

35:06.626 --> 35:07.888
I'm patient.

35:07.931 --> 35:08.976
Lena.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.329
Wait.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.350
The senators are
making their way in now.

35:35.394 --> 35:39.441
Until the President arrives,
we will only be doing photos.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.272
No sign of Eve down here yet.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.839
Maybe I'd better look up there.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.190
Senator Granberry,
excuse me for a second.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.583
Uh, what happened?

35:50.626 --> 35:52.280
Why did you change your vote?

35:55.588 --> 35:57.329
Just take the win.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.272
Mr. Lockwood.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.493
No questions, Mr. Olsen.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.844
You're aware that Otis Graves
helped Lex Luthor escape,
aren't you?

36:35.671 --> 36:39.980
Otis Graves is deceased.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.329
Actually, he's not.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.768
I have nothing to do
with Lex Luthor.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.466
Sure about that?

37:02.394 --> 37:04.091
Supergirl.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.832
How on earth did you find me?

37:05.875 --> 37:08.269
The only car protected
with an X-ray scatter field?

37:08.313 --> 37:09.792
Oh, poo.

37:09.836 --> 37:10.880
Out of the car.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.362
Enjoy the show.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.357
-My dad.
-Come on.

37:53.619 --> 37:54.663
Let's go.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.536
- Take her out!

38:09.548 --> 38:10.505
Oh, my God.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.405
Let them hate

38:41.144 --> 38:42.885
so long as they fear.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.070
It was Supergirl.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.752
My fellow Americans,

39:24.710 --> 39:26.581
by now you have surely heard

39:26.625 --> 39:29.497
that the heart of our
great nation was attacked...

39:31.020 --> 39:34.763
by someone many of you trusted
with your security

39:34.807 --> 39:36.417
and your hopes.

39:37.636 --> 39:38.593
Supergirl.

39:38.637 --> 39:41.030
She attacked in retaliation

39:41.074 --> 39:44.033
to the repeal
of the Alien Amnesty Act,

39:44.077 --> 39:47.210
ignoring our democracy
in favor of her own

39:47.254 --> 39:49.299
alien brute form of justice.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.259
The American people
have welcomed these aliens,

39:53.608 --> 39:56.306
they've repaid our hospitality with violence.

39:56.350 --> 39:59.440
But we are not weak,
we are Americans.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.400
We are humans.

40:04.184 --> 40:08.231
I am hereby enacting martial law for our protection.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.669
And, Supergirl,
if you are watching,

40:10.712 --> 40:13.541
make no mistake,

40:13.585 --> 40:17.458
this act of horrific terrorism will not go unanswered.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.681
You are now
public enemy number one.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.296
Mmm-mmm.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.690
There's no way Supergirl would
do something like this.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.042
I know.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.191
I was wrong.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.634
I need your help.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.638
Think you can stick around?

41:08.074 --> 41:09.641
I'm not going anywhere.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.216
This is J'onn J'onzz,
private investigator.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.480
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.019
Did you call me here
to arrest me?

41:40.062 --> 41:41.673
We know you didn't do this.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.501
-That you would never
do something like this.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.720
We're on your side, Supergirl.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.679
We're gonna
find out the truth.

41:47.722 --> 41:48.549
Together.
