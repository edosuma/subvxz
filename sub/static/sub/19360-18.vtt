00:07.364 --> 00:08.730
<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:08.765 --> 00:10.298
<i>the historic vote in Turkey</i>

00:10.333 --> 00:12.567
<i>that could change
the face of Europe.</i>

00:15.538 --> 00:17.706
<i>This is a
proposal to turn Turkey</i>

00:17.741 --> 00:20.141
into Wahhabist's version
of North Korea.

00:20.176 --> 00:21.710
<i>This is what we are fearing.</i>

00:24.014 --> 00:27.014
It's the day before the
referendum here in Istanbul,

00:27.049 --> 00:29.617
and President Erdogan is
holding several rallies.

00:59.648 --> 01:02.616
Last summer, television
cameras from around the world

01:02.651 --> 01:05.352
were transfixed by a
dramatic coup in Turkey.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.221
An attempted coup in Turkey.

01:08.257 --> 01:10.390
<i>The military claiming
it has seized power</i>

01:10.425 --> 01:11.625
<i>from Turkey's president.</i>

01:11.660 --> 01:13.627
<i>The president says
the coup has failed.</i>

01:13.662 --> 01:15.094
We're watching
people right now

01:15.130 --> 01:17.997
pouring into the streets
after this military coup.

01:18.033 --> 01:20.299
<i>President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan</i>

01:20.334 --> 01:22.669
<i>used the passions and
political tensions</i>

01:22.704 --> 01:24.303
<i>to push through a referendum</i>

01:24.338 --> 01:26.605
<i>that granted him
sweeping new powers</i>

01:26.641 --> 01:30.677
and moved Turkey's democracy
closer to dictatorship.

01:35.749 --> 01:37.916
Turkey is
a crucial American ally

01:37.951 --> 01:39.851
<i>and a longtime member of NATO,</i>

01:39.887 --> 01:42.388
<i>but now,
Erdogan's victory in April</i>

01:42.423 --> 01:44.557
<i>is shaking old alliances
with the West.</i>

01:44.592 --> 01:46.892
So, we sent Isobel
Yeung to Istanbul

01:46.927 --> 01:49.027
to witness this historic vote.

02:08.114 --> 02:11.416
Everyone's outside,
celebrating jubilantly.

02:11.451 --> 02:14.051
This right here is
President Erdogan's home,

02:14.087 --> 02:16.421
and people have gathered
in their thousands

02:16.456 --> 02:17.988
to congratulate each other

02:18.024 --> 02:21.025
and to celebrate the results,
despite the tight margin.

02:45.150 --> 02:47.984
<i>Turkey's historic
referendum has the potential</i>

02:48.019 --> 02:52.689
<i>to be a major turning point in
the future of global politics.</i>

02:52.725 --> 02:55.291
<i>With the fall of the Ottoman
Empire after World War I,</i>

02:55.326 --> 02:57.493
<i>Turkey was established
as a republic,</i>

02:57.528 --> 03:00.496
<i>long known for secularism
and democracy.</i>

03:00.531 --> 03:03.332
<i>But those principles
have slowly been eroded</i>

03:03.368 --> 03:05.568
<i>under the leadership
of President Erdogan.</i>

03:07.139 --> 03:08.905
<i>He's built a cult of personality</i>

03:08.940 --> 03:09.940
<i>stemming from years</i>

03:09.975 --> 03:11.106
<i>of economic booms...</i>

03:11.976 --> 03:13.376
<i>defending Islamic values,</i>

03:13.411 --> 03:15.878
<i>and defying Turkey's
international rivals.</i>

03:17.248 --> 03:20.849
<i>After serving the maximum three
terms as prime minister,</i>

03:20.885 --> 03:23.586
<i>Erdogan was elected
president in 2014.</i>

03:27.124 --> 03:28.523
<i>A role which, until now,</i>

03:28.558 --> 03:30.325
<i>has largely been ceremonial.</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:34.763
<i>With this vote, Erdogan is effectively
rewriting the constitution.</i>

03:34.799 --> 03:37.866
<i>There will no longer be
a prime minister,</i>

03:37.902 --> 03:39.601
<i>the president assumes
broad control</i>

03:39.636 --> 03:41.904
<i>of the judiciary,
can rule by decree,</i>

03:41.939 --> 03:45.173
<i>and could remain
in power until 2034,</i>

03:45.208 --> 03:48.276
<i>which critics fear will cement
his one-man rule.</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:57.585
<i>We followed the run-up
to this highly-divisive vote</i>

03:57.621 --> 04:02.123
<i>to understand why a key American
ally is pulling away from democracy.</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:05.793
<i>That journey began
in Washington, D.C.</i>

04:06.863 --> 04:08.729
We're at Washington Dulles
Airport, and these guys

04:08.764 --> 04:11.299
that just pulled up here
are Turkish delegates

04:11.334 --> 04:14.202
who have arrived with
thousands of ballot papers

04:14.237 --> 04:16.103
that they've been collecting
over the last few weeks

04:16.139 --> 04:18.271
in preparation
for the referendum.

04:18.307 --> 04:21.241
<i>Turkish citizens all around
the world rallied</i>

04:21.276 --> 04:22.776
<i>for this historic referendum,</i>

04:22.812 --> 04:25.145
<i>convinced that
the future of the country</i>

04:25.180 --> 04:26.613
<i>hung in the balance.</i>

04:26.649 --> 04:27.649
<i>As tensions mounted,</i>

04:27.683 --> 04:30.784
<i>Turkish relations
with the EU hit a new low.</i>

04:32.221 --> 04:35.788
<i>Here in the US, we traveled
with delegates from each side.</i>

04:35.824 --> 04:37.891
<i>Omer supports a "Yes" vote,</i>

04:37.926 --> 04:39.926
<i>while Yurter is from
the opposing party.</i>

04:39.962 --> 04:41.862
Three million Turkish diaspora,

04:41.897 --> 04:44.397
that's pretty significant. These
votes could make a real difference.

04:44.432 --> 04:48.969
Yeah, it changes about three
percent of total votes.

04:49.004 --> 04:52.405
Why should the world care, in
general, what happens in Turkey?

04:52.440 --> 04:55.207
Number one,
Turkey is a NATO member.

04:55.243 --> 04:58.043
Number two,
Turkey is the only secular

04:58.079 --> 05:01.581
and democratic country with a
predominantly Muslim population.

05:02.884 --> 05:07.052
And number three, because of
its geostrategic location.

05:08.256 --> 05:09.688
<i>Turkey is the gateway</i>

05:09.723 --> 05:11.357
<i>between Europe
and the Middle East.</i>

05:11.392 --> 05:14.426
<i>It's home to over three
million Syrian refugees</i>

05:14.461 --> 05:16.128
<i>more than any other nation.</i>

05:16.163 --> 05:17.997
<i>And a recent string
of terrorist attacks</i>

05:18.032 --> 05:20.065
<i>by ISIS and Kurdish insurgents</i>

05:20.101 --> 05:21.833
<i>have further
destabilized the country,</i>

05:21.869 --> 05:24.770
<i>garnering support
for Erdogan's strongman rule.</i>

05:24.805 --> 05:27.105
<i>In the world's
most volatile region,</i>

05:27.140 --> 05:29.674
<i>Turkey is a vital Western ally,</i>

05:29.710 --> 05:32.444
<i>maintaining the second-largest
military in NATO.</i>

05:32.479 --> 05:36.415
<i>But factions of that military
shocked the world in July 2016,</i>

05:36.450 --> 05:39.450
<i>with an attempt to overthrow
President Erdogan.</i>

05:42.255 --> 05:44.355
<i>As the coup plotters
took to the streets,</i>

05:44.391 --> 05:47.258
<i>President Erdogan spoke to
journalist Hande Firat.</i>

05:47.294 --> 05:50.594
Maybe you can just give us an account
of what happened that night.

06:47.918 --> 06:50.119
<i>Galvanized by
Erdogan's call to arms,</i>

06:50.154 --> 06:52.455
<i>crowds of people
confronted the coup plotters</i>

06:52.490 --> 06:54.323
<i>on Istanbul's Bosphorus Bridge.</i>

06:55.360 --> 06:56.525
<i>Melih Ecertas,</i>

06:56.560 --> 06:58.327
<i>leader of the AK
Party Youth Branch,</i>

06:58.363 --> 07:00.162
<i>was there to fight
for what he saw</i>

07:00.198 --> 07:02.097
<i>as a pivotal moment for Erdogan.</i>

07:02.132 --> 07:04.332
There were four tanks.

07:04.368 --> 07:07.536
<i>There were maybe 60
soldiers with rifles</i>

07:07.571 --> 07:10.572
<i>The people were
walking down to here...</i>

07:10.608 --> 07:12.407
<i>protesting.</i>

07:12.442 --> 07:14.743
<i>The soldiers were shooting.</i>

07:18.215 --> 07:20.781
<i>So, you saw
several people die.</i>

07:20.817 --> 07:22.617
I saw several people martyred,

07:22.652 --> 07:25.153
<i>so we feel this is
a battlefield.</i>

07:25.188 --> 07:27.722
<i>The police officers
throughout the country</i>

07:27.757 --> 07:29.790
<i>just start shooting with them.</i>

07:29.826 --> 07:32.193
<i>After half an hour,
the soldiers,</i>

07:32.229 --> 07:33.661
<i>they are giving up.</i>

07:33.696 --> 07:36.196
<i>And then the people
are screaming,</i>

07:36.232 --> 07:38.699
<i>"We got
the Bosphorus Bridge."</i>

07:38.735 --> 07:42.970
<i>At the end of the night,
50 people were killed in here.</i>

07:43.006 --> 07:46.507
<i>In all Turkey, around
250 people were killed.</i>

07:57.619 --> 08:00.154
<i>Support for Erdogan
surged after the coup</i>

08:00.189 --> 08:03.323
<i>and emboldened him to crack
down on those responsible.</i>

08:03.359 --> 08:05.059
<i>He began by arresting followers</i>

08:05.094 --> 08:06.527
<i>of Islamist cleric
Fethullah Gulen,</i>

08:06.562 --> 08:10.030
<i>his former ally, now living
in exile in Pennsylvania.</i>

08:10.065 --> 08:13.900
<i>But critics claim Erdogan has
since used the state of emergency</i>

08:13.936 --> 08:16.469
<i>as a chance to purge
all opposition.</i>

08:16.504 --> 08:18.204
<i>Meanwhile, supporters like Mileh</i>

08:18.239 --> 08:20.239
<i>are tirelessly campaigning
for a "Yes" vote</i>

08:20.275 --> 08:22.375
<i>to expand Erdogan's powers.</i>

08:24.345 --> 08:26.079
Obviously, you've spoken
to so many people

08:26.114 --> 08:27.947
over the last few weeks
in your campaigning.

08:27.982 --> 08:30.849
What are the biggest issues they
have with constitutional change?

08:30.885 --> 08:34.753
They would like to understand
the basic change,

08:34.789 --> 08:38.291
and we will start telling them,
"We need a strong Turkey.

08:38.326 --> 08:41.326
We need
a strong judiciary system."

08:41.361 --> 08:42.828
They start understand.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.299
In total, across Turkey,

08:47.334 --> 08:48.614
how many volunteers do you have?

08:49.604 --> 08:50.469
Wow.

08:50.504 --> 08:52.471
<i>Thanks to a strong
parliamentary backing,</i>

08:52.506 --> 08:56.408
<i>the "Yes" campaign draws on significant
funding and state resources.</i>

09:00.414 --> 09:04.282
You all are? If I see Erdogan, I'll
tell him he has a very big fan base here.

09:11.057 --> 09:12.557
<i>The AK Party
Youth Branch has held</i>

09:12.593 --> 09:15.126
<i>7,000 of these
"Yes" campaign events</i>

09:15.161 --> 09:17.495
<i>in the 45 days leading up
to the referendum.</i>

09:26.572 --> 09:28.172
Right now, they're
playing on the screens

09:28.207 --> 09:30.508
scenes from July 15th
of the attempted coup.

09:30.543 --> 09:32.909
It's
a very strong reaction

09:32.945 --> 09:36.514
as soon as anyone from the
opposition comes on the screen.

10:02.507 --> 10:05.341
<i>There was a clear momentum
behind the "Yes" campaign.</i>

10:05.377 --> 10:08.178
<i>In part, that's because critics
have largely been silenced</i>

10:08.213 --> 10:09.546
<i>in the post-coup purge.</i>

10:09.581 --> 10:12.515
<i>Over 110,000 people
have been detained,</i>

10:12.551 --> 10:15.785
<i>accused of being Gulenists
or enemies of the state.</i>

10:15.820 --> 10:17.587
<i>Police officers, civil servants,</i>

10:17.622 --> 10:19.589
<i>and journalists
have been sacked.</i>

10:19.624 --> 10:21.891
<i>And in academia,
tens of thousands</i>

10:21.926 --> 10:24.359
<i>of teachers and professors
have been dismissed,</i>

10:24.395 --> 10:27.229
<i>but some of those professors
are attempting to fight back</i>

10:27.264 --> 10:29.398
<i>by taking their classes
underground.</i>

10:32.369 --> 10:35.637
<i> Many of these professors
formerly taught at Ankara University.</i>

10:35.673 --> 10:38.139
How long have you
been working in academia?

11:01.732 --> 11:04.465
Are you saying that none of the
professors who were dismissed

11:04.500 --> 11:06.835
were in any way linked
to the Gulenist movement?

11:14.244 --> 11:17.411
What do you think this
means for the future of Turkey?

11:21.718 --> 11:25.386
<i>And it's not just
academia that's under attack.</i>

11:25.421 --> 11:27.788
<i>Lawyers and judges
who are seen as sympathetic</i>

11:27.823 --> 11:31.024
<i>to detainees
have also been targeted.</i>

11:31.060 --> 11:33.293
<i>A group of lawyers
are staging weekly protests</i>

11:33.328 --> 11:35.362
<i>against the arrests
of their colleagues.</i>

11:35.397 --> 11:37.865
<i>One of them agreed
to speak with us.</i>

11:58.086 --> 12:02.155
As a lawyer, do you feel like
the current judiciary system

12:02.190 --> 12:04.490
in Turkey will provide justice?

12:10.031 --> 12:12.731
<i>The deterioration
of the rule of law</i>

12:12.767 --> 12:16.602
<i>has fueled opposition to Erdogan's
proposed constitutional changes.</i>

12:16.637 --> 12:19.538
<i>Groups like this one
are campaigning for "No,"</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:20.906
"Hayir"<i> in Turkish.</i>

12:35.789 --> 12:36.988
We're with the "No" campaigners

12:37.024 --> 12:39.791
as they're handing out
leaflets as well.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.227
Slightly more mellow campaign

12:42.262 --> 12:45.496
than it was when we were
with the AKP guys.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.099
It's really divided.
You can see the difference.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.100
Like, when you're
in Kadikoy or here,

12:50.136 --> 12:54.104
it seems, like, great,
and you feel more confident,

12:54.140 --> 12:58.609
and then, like, in just 20
minutes, everything changed.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.511
You're in a conservative
neighborhood,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.847
and you can feel
just the opposite.

13:02.882 --> 13:04.682
Yeah, it does feel very divided.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.583
It feels very, very different.
Yeah, it is like

13:06.618 --> 13:08.819
Turkish community
is so divided now.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.573
Tensions are running very high by the
looks of things. Yeah, yeah, of course.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.746
What are the main reasons that
you're campaigning for "No"?

13:35.781 --> 13:39.082
This is scary. I mean,
as a woman, especially,

13:39.117 --> 13:42.285
I really don't want to live
in a religious country.

13:42.320 --> 13:47.190
We know this from other,
like, Middle Eastern countries.

13:47.225 --> 13:51.427
If there is a "Yes" vote, what does
Turkey look like in 10, 20 years time?

13:51.462 --> 13:53.763
Some people talks
about civil war.

13:53.798 --> 13:57.466
And yeah, there's
no good scenario at all.

13:57.502 --> 14:02.471
We will have, obviously,
a dictatorship with "Yes."

14:02.507 --> 14:06.008
Why is it, do you think, that so
many people are voting for "Yes"?

14:06.043 --> 14:09.578
Turkish people feel
like they're alone,

14:09.614 --> 14:11.947
and, like, Europe hates them,

14:11.982 --> 14:15.884
like-- I don't know-- America
hates them, everybody hates them.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.287
<i>That popular
belief stems in part</i>

14:18.322 --> 14:21.056
<i>from 30 years of being
denied entry to the EU,</i>

14:21.091 --> 14:24.526
<i>which many believe
is rooted in Islamophobia.</i>

14:33.136 --> 14:35.737
<i>Widespread disappointment
at this rejection</i>

14:35.772 --> 14:37.371
<i>has helped garner
nationalist views</i>

14:37.407 --> 14:40.542
<i>that have only deepened the
polarization within society.</i>

14:40.577 --> 14:43.578
I was attacked
by 15 members of parliament,

14:43.613 --> 14:45.112
who were female members,

14:45.148 --> 14:47.949
<i>with screwdrivers
and scissors in their hands.</i>

14:47.984 --> 14:49.283
<i>For the past six years,</i>

14:49.319 --> 14:50.851
<i>Safak Pavey has served</i>

14:50.886 --> 14:52.086
<i>as a parliamentary member</i>

14:52.121 --> 14:53.821
<i>for Turkey's main
opposition party.</i>

14:53.856 --> 14:57.258
Anyone who is
a non-supporter for them,

14:57.293 --> 15:02.563
is gonna be facing
imprisonment, social lynching.

15:02.598 --> 15:04.631
This is a proposal
to turn Turkey

15:04.667 --> 15:07.000
into Wahhabist's version
of North Korea,

15:07.035 --> 15:08.301
so this is what we're fearing.

15:08.337 --> 15:10.771
President Erdogan
is incredibly popular.

15:10.806 --> 15:12.072
I see his image everywhere.

15:12.107 --> 15:14.775
A lot of people that I've
spoken to have sung his praises

15:14.810 --> 15:17.978
and have said that Turkey has
transformed under his leadership

15:18.013 --> 15:20.981
and that economic transformation,
financial transformation,

15:21.016 --> 15:23.283
infrastructure's being built
under his leadership,

15:23.318 --> 15:25.785
which wasn't built
under the CHP's leadership.

15:25.820 --> 15:30.156
Um, no. I-- I have to say that
this is part of their propaganda.

15:30.192 --> 15:34.059
Government controlled media
is about 99 percent

15:34.095 --> 15:35.828
of Turkish media right now,

15:35.864 --> 15:39.732
so there's almost no space
allowed for our messages.

15:39.767 --> 15:43.769
But the biggest power that they
have is the religious populism.

15:43.805 --> 15:48.073
I mean, just this week,
Erdogan has declared

15:48.109 --> 15:50.675
that those citizens
that vote for "No,"

15:50.711 --> 15:52.978
they will lose
their place in heaven.

16:02.723 --> 16:06.091
<i> In Turkey, the mosques are
directly answerable to the state,</i>

16:06.127 --> 16:07.692
<i>meaning the government
can easily reach</i>

16:07.728 --> 16:10.028
<i>the congregation of millions
of people a week.</i>

16:20.607 --> 16:24.208
What sort of role do you think that
religion plays here in Turkey?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.953
Why is it that you
weren't able to go to school

16:35.988 --> 16:38.923
with your headscarf before
AK Party came to power?

16:53.806 --> 16:57.474
Is there anything about
Turkey you think that, uh...

16:57.509 --> 17:00.877
people in the West, people in
America might not understand?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.295
<i> That sentiment, that Erdogan
is the reason for Turkey's strength,</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:22.298
<i>is echoed by huge swaths
of the population.</i>

17:27.405 --> 17:30.473
It's the day before the
referendum here in Istanbul,

17:30.508 --> 17:34.210
and President Erdogan is holding
several rallies throughout the city.

17:34.245 --> 17:37.379
They're expecting hundreds of
thousands of people to be attending

17:37.415 --> 17:40.549
and to be rallying and
campaigning for the "Yes" vote.

17:42.286 --> 17:44.353
<i>In the height
of this frenzied atmosphere,</i>

17:44.388 --> 17:46.254
<i>we finally caught
a glimpse of the man</i>

17:46.289 --> 17:49.024
<i>at the center
of this divisive vote.</i>

19:27.521 --> 19:29.521
<i>With the "Yes"
campaign at a fever pitch,</i>

19:29.556 --> 19:31.990
<i>it was finally the day
of the referendum.</i>

19:32.026 --> 19:36.195
<i>A massive 85 percent of the
population turned out to vote.</i>

19:36.230 --> 19:39.031
<i>We went to a "No" campaign
HQ, where what played out</i>

19:39.066 --> 19:43.501
<i>over the next few hours would determine
the direction of Turkey's entire future.</i>

20:13.833 --> 20:16.032
The atmosphere here is
getting more and more subdued

20:16.068 --> 20:17.868
as all the votes are coming in.

20:17.903 --> 20:19.870
Almost all of them
have been counted now,

20:19.905 --> 20:22.306
and it's standing
at about 52 percent "Yes"

20:22.341 --> 20:23.774
and 48 percent "No."

20:23.809 --> 20:26.009
It's not the result that
these guys are hoping for.

20:26.044 --> 20:28.845
<i>In spite of the significant
advantages afforded</i>

20:28.881 --> 20:31.648
<i>to the "Yes" campaign,
the vote was nearly split,</i>

20:31.683 --> 20:35.485
<i>signifying just how deeply
divided the country really is.</i>

20:48.733 --> 20:52.101
Do you see this as a turning
point in Turkey's history?

21:04.215 --> 21:08.184
We've heard that there is Erdogan
supporters out on the streets already,

21:08.219 --> 21:11.253
so we're heading towards
President Erdogan's house,

21:11.289 --> 21:12.788
to see what's
going on down there.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.626
How are you feeling tonight?

21:26.269 --> 21:29.037
What do you think this means
to the rest of the world?

21:35.045 --> 21:36.010
<i>While Erdogan supporters</i>

21:36.046 --> 21:38.479
<i>celebrated their victory
against the world,</i>

21:38.514 --> 21:41.182
<i>international monitors
slammed the validity</i>

21:41.218 --> 21:43.684
<i>- of the referendum itself.</i>
<i>- They don't believe</i>

21:43.720 --> 21:45.220
this referendum was fair.

21:45.255 --> 21:46.821
<i>The State
Department acknowledged</i>

21:46.857 --> 21:49.123
<i>the concerns the international
monitors raised.</i>

21:49.159 --> 21:51.726
The 16th April
constitutional referendum

21:51.761 --> 21:55.529
took place on an
unlevel playing field.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.064
<i>To understand
how the country</i>

21:57.099 --> 21:58.666
<i>can move forward, we sat down</i>

21:58.701 --> 22:00.968
<i>with Deputy Prime
Minister Veysi Kaynak.</i>

22:01.003 --> 22:04.204
There are widespread protests
throughout the country.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.575
Can you understand why
almost half the population

22:07.610 --> 22:10.410
feels deeply concerned
that Turkey is now

22:10.445 --> 22:12.579
on a path to one-man rule?

22:35.003 --> 22:36.703
I have to bring it to you that

22:36.738 --> 22:41.007
not only opposition groups,
but also international monitors

22:41.042 --> 22:43.675
around the world have said
that that these results

22:43.711 --> 22:45.477
are heavily, heavily contested.

22:45.513 --> 22:48.347
How do you plan
to reconcile those issues?

23:04.832 --> 23:10.335
It seems like there's a real distrust of
media in Turkey, including foreign media.

23:10.370 --> 23:13.972
Why do you think it is that Turkey
struggles so much with freedom of press?

23:24.717 --> 23:26.284
Turkey has locked up
more journalists

23:26.320 --> 23:27.319
than anywhere else in the world.

23:27.354 --> 23:29.787
Obviously, freedom of
press is an issue here.

23:47.841 --> 23:51.342
What happens to your role now
that, under this new system,

23:51.377 --> 23:54.178
the prime minister's position
is obsolete?

23:54.213 --> 23:57.381
Presumably the deputy prime
minister's position is also obsolete.

23:57.416 --> 23:59.516
Have you done yourself
out of a job?

24:19.471 --> 24:22.038
<i>But whether this
transfer of power to Erdogan</i>

24:22.073 --> 24:24.807
<i>actually brings more stability
remains to be seen.</i>

24:24.842 --> 24:27.310
<i>Since the referendum,
Germany has moved</i>

24:27.345 --> 24:30.179
<i>to withdraw its troops
from a NATO airbase in Turkey,</i>

24:30.215 --> 24:35.485
<i>and Erdogan's own bodyguards violently
attacked protesters on an official D.C. visit.</i>

24:38.689 --> 24:42.124
<i>In Turkey, the state of emergency
was extended once again</i>

24:42.159 --> 24:45.460
<i>and thousands more have
been fired and detained.</i>

24:45.496 --> 24:48.664
<i>We followed as protesters
took to the streets.</i>

24:56.306 --> 24:59.441
It's not just even
Middle East or Islam.

24:59.476 --> 25:04.513
<i>The whole world is going to be
more and more conservative,</i>

25:04.548 --> 25:08.550
populist, religious, as you can
see even in the US for example.

25:11.055 --> 25:14.689
<i>We do know how
vital our struggle is</i>

25:14.724 --> 25:16.991
to keep modernity alive
in Turkey.

25:17.027 --> 25:18.693
<i>This is our struggle's name,</i>

25:18.728 --> 25:20.862
<i>and it has global consequences,</i>

25:20.897 --> 25:24.165
whether we can survive
out of this or not.
