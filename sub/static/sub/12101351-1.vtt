00:03.478 --> 00:06.883
McCarthy Quad
serves as the hub of USC life.

00:06.916 --> 00:08.751
You know they say if it
rains on your college tour,

00:08.785 --> 00:10.485
it's bad luck to go there?

00:10.519 --> 00:11.621
Nobody says that.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.824
And I probably won't
even get the scholarship.

00:15.524 --> 00:17.359
Mom, can you just keep an open
mind?

00:17.392 --> 00:18.527
I have an open mind.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.429
You can move 3,000 miles away
from me.

00:20.462 --> 00:22.632
Or you can go to a local New
York college

00:22.665 --> 00:23.733
and live at home.

00:23.766 --> 00:24.901
- Everybody wins.
- On your right-

00:24.934 --> 00:25.835
- Except for me.

00:25.868 --> 00:28.470
USC's student union building,

00:28.503 --> 00:31.641
a hallmark of Romanesque
revival architecture.

00:31.674 --> 00:33.743
Seems a bit outdated to me.

00:33.776 --> 00:35.177
Dad loved it here.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.244
Your dad was a great man.

00:36.278 --> 00:38.815
A great taste, no, not so much.

00:38.848 --> 00:41.450
On your left, Leavey Library.

00:41.483 --> 00:43.251
Open 24/7.

00:43.285 --> 00:45.722
It's not uncommon to see
students

00:45.755 --> 00:47.356
leaving at four in the morning.

00:47.389 --> 00:48.825
Ooh, that doesn't seem safe.

00:48.858 --> 00:49.692
Mom!

00:49.726 --> 00:51.628
Does anyone have any questions
for me?

00:51.661 --> 00:52.862
Yes.

00:52.895 --> 00:55.632
Please tell me a little bit
about campus crime statistics.

00:55.665 --> 00:58.701
Mom, can you pretend to be
normal?

00:58.735 --> 00:59.802
Yeah.

00:59.836 --> 01:01.370
How can I be normal?

01:01.403 --> 01:02.905
What's the normal thing to say?

01:02.939 --> 01:05.574
Tell me something normal, I'll
say it.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.746
She's not a very good tour
guide.

01:28.998 --> 01:29.866
Chlamydia.

01:31.233 --> 01:31.868
You're vertical.

01:31.901 --> 01:32.935
I am horizontal.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.671
Oh, this way, yeah,
okay.

01:34.704 --> 01:37.607
Also, chlamydia has eight
letters.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.909
Nine. The H is silent.

01:39.942 --> 01:41.243
It's probably one of the two
questions

01:41.276 --> 01:42.945
you got wrong on your SATs.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.514
Why would chlamydia be on the
SAT?

01:45.547 --> 01:48.250
Well, to subconsciously
dissuade students

01:48.283 --> 01:50.620
from having sex, obviously.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.556
Here are
your meals.

01:55.692 --> 01:56.659
Here.

01:56.693 --> 01:57.927
Thank you. Great.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.561
Thank you.

01:59.595 --> 02:00.429
I'm just gonna

02:00.462 --> 02:01.964
- quickly do that.
- Hey!

02:01.998 --> 02:03.633
I'll have more cake, thank you
very much.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.001
- I know you want this.
- And I definitely

02:05.034 --> 02:06.002
don't want this.

02:07.804 --> 02:11.674
Ah, why did I push
you to get straight As?

02:12.608 --> 02:15.410
If I only knew I was pushing
you straight out the door.

02:15.444 --> 02:17.279
It's just college, Mom.

02:17.312 --> 02:19.247
What am I gonna do when you're
gone?

02:19.281 --> 02:20.549
I'm not dying.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.420
You should have just
encouraged me to flunk.

02:25.454 --> 02:26.421
100%.

02:30.392 --> 02:31.359
Kermit.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.897
Stick to vertical.

02:34.931 --> 02:36.431
It's weird 'cause it fits.

02:47.476 --> 02:50.046
Leave a big tip. He knows where
we live.

03:13.703 --> 03:15.337
Hey, Mom.

03:15.370 --> 03:16.304
Good night.

03:42.665 --> 03:43.498
The septums.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.802
And I.

03:45.835 --> 03:47.770
And I was hoping to
create a controlled crack-

03:47.804 --> 03:49.739
- Oh, she's gonna look like a
platypus

03:49.772 --> 03:50.873
when he's done with her.

03:50.907 --> 03:52.507
And won't light them
up.

03:52.541 --> 03:54.442
So we want to bring in a
little butcher's carve-

03:55.178 --> 03:56.579
What's he doing to her nose?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.413
It's a lateral osteotomy.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.348
He's narrowing the nasal bridge.

04:00.382 --> 04:02.585
She's gonna look like this.

04:02.618 --> 04:03.518
Uh huh.

04:03.552 --> 04:04.787
Yeah, she doesn't look like she
likes it.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.589
Well, she's anesthetized.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.824
So she doesn't really know.

04:07.857 --> 04:10.392
We go right through
the septum.

04:10.425 --> 04:12.662
You don't even need to
put a suture in there.

04:12.695 --> 04:13.729
Here, you can feel it.

04:13.763 --> 04:16.065
Oh, the new neighbors
are blocking the driveway.

04:16.098 --> 04:16.933
Well, they're not

04:16.966 --> 04:17.900
very considerate people.

04:17.934 --> 04:19.702
Oh! They just hit the tree!

04:19.735 --> 04:21.671
They just... I'm going out
there.

04:23.105 --> 04:24.573
Here we ask Hume here

04:24.607 --> 04:26.809
to attach the soft tissue.

04:26.843 --> 04:29.078
And we're now between the septum

04:29.111 --> 04:31.147
and the right nasal bone.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.483
We are perpendicular to
the bone on the left side.

04:35.517 --> 04:38.054
Well, you
guess he's afraid of me?

04:38.087 --> 04:39.421
What?

04:39.454 --> 04:40.089
No way!

04:40.122 --> 04:40.957
What happened?

04:40.990 --> 04:42.592
He told me to fuck off.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.593
What?

04:43.626 --> 04:44.627
What a jerk.

05:02.444 --> 05:04.546
Oh my god.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.548
Look what that psycho did to
Dad's tree!

05:06.582 --> 05:07.750
It's not that bad.

05:07.783 --> 05:08.918
And he's staring at us.

05:08.951 --> 05:10.052
I see you too!

05:11.954 --> 05:13.789
Oh god, why do we have this
neighbor?

05:22.899 --> 05:24.033
Don't go.

05:24.066 --> 05:25.167
I have a quiz.

05:25.201 --> 05:27.603
You do not have to go to
USC just because Dad did.

05:27.637 --> 05:28.804
You can do pre-med anywhere.

05:28.838 --> 05:29.906
Bye, Mom.

05:29.939 --> 05:30.806
Love you.

05:39.248 --> 05:42.184
I'm just saying, all we
have left is each other.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.853
Love you, Mom.

05:51.694 --> 05:53.696
There's a mistake waiting to
happen.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.197
I thought you already slept
with him.

05:55.231 --> 05:56.999
No, that was his brother.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.000
Well, how was it?

05:58.034 --> 05:59.969
So good, that's why
I wanna get with him.

06:01.804 --> 06:03.839
Another mistake waiting to
happen.

06:03.873 --> 06:04.974
Mr. Franklin?

06:05.007 --> 06:06.574
- Yeah.
- Ew!

06:06.609 --> 06:07.743
Sharp right.

06:10.012 --> 06:10.880
Hi.

06:13.616 --> 06:15.517
Seriously?

06:15.550 --> 06:16.585
I gotta make time.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.089
Buzz kill!

06:21.057 --> 06:24.559
Hey, aren't you valedictorian?

06:24.593 --> 06:25.661
Salutatorian.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.562
Ooh, not as good.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.633
Hey, those pants do not
do your body justice.

06:30.666 --> 06:31.533
Excuse me?

06:33.269 --> 06:35.037
Are those Nine's?

06:35.071 --> 06:37.106
Those are the worst Nike
knockoffs I've ever seen.

06:37.139 --> 06:38.975
You know you're not gonna
make good time in those.

06:39.008 --> 06:41.143
You're really bothering me.

06:41.177 --> 06:42.144
I don't think I am.

06:42.178 --> 06:44.780
I think we're having a
great conversation here.

06:44.814 --> 06:47.883
Hey, Mr. Franklin, what place
did she get?

06:47.917 --> 06:49.652
Daniel, back to class.

06:53.956 --> 06:54.890
Is that vodka?

06:54.924 --> 06:56.158
Why don't you say it
a little bit louder?

06:56.192 --> 06:57.226
Is that vodka?

06:58.560 --> 06:59.996
Back to class!

07:01.664 --> 07:06.769
Well, have you
ever tried acupuncture?

07:06.802 --> 07:08.104
'Cause I know an acupuncturist.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.706
I don't think he's
licensed, but he is Korean.

07:10.740 --> 07:12.742
Wait, excuse me, who are you
talking to?

07:12.775 --> 07:13.709
Linda.

07:13.743 --> 07:15.678
What? I told you I'm
not taking her case.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.581
Oh, come on Bill, she
is in so much back pain.

07:18.614 --> 07:20.649
She has no money, her son
is going off to college-

07:20.683 --> 07:22.051
- Hang up.

07:22.084 --> 07:23.119
I mean just take it.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.588
Do you have to make money
on every single case?

07:25.621 --> 07:28.758
I don't believe this.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.795
I think I can get him to take
it.

07:36.932 --> 07:37.933
Thank you.

07:47.910 --> 07:48.778
Hey.

07:53.049 --> 07:53.916
Mom?

08:01.824 --> 08:02.691
Mom?

08:10.132 --> 08:11.000
What are you doing?

08:11.033 --> 08:16.038
Shh shh shh shh.

08:23.646 --> 08:25.347
The neighbor threw a rock at
me.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.649
- What?
- Yeah.

08:26.682 --> 08:29.018
I was doing laundry, I heard a
bang.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.686
Thank god he missed the window.

08:31.654 --> 08:32.354
Wait, can I see?

08:34.757 --> 08:35.724
I can't...

08:39.061 --> 08:40.930
What are you doing? Would you
get down?

08:41.864 --> 08:42.932
What? Are you trying to get hit?

08:42.965 --> 08:43.833
Well...

08:47.169 --> 08:48.003
I'm gonna confront him.

08:48.037 --> 08:49.939
Oh, oh, are you out of your
mind?

08:49.972 --> 08:50.906
He could hurt you.

08:57.213 --> 08:59.215
This is like that
movie.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.717
What movie?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.018
The one with what's her name.

09:04.220 --> 09:06.021
Oh yeah, yeah. I love that
movie.

09:19.268 --> 09:22.138
Melanie, Melanie, he's trying to
break in!

09:24.006 --> 09:24.773
Who?

09:24.807 --> 09:26.442
The neighbor! Who do you
think?

09:26.475 --> 09:28.077
He walked by my window.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.714
And then he jingles the door
handle on the back door.

09:31.747 --> 09:32.414
Okay.

09:33.382 --> 09:35.751
I think we're supposed
to hide under a triangle.

09:35.784 --> 09:36.952
What?

09:36.986 --> 09:37.820
That's in an earthquake.

09:37.853 --> 09:39.021
What's wrong with you?

09:39.054 --> 09:40.156
I don't know, I'm half asleep.

09:40.189 --> 09:41.056
Okay.

09:42.858 --> 09:43.726
Okay, okay.

09:45.828 --> 09:46.929
He might have a weapon.

09:46.962 --> 09:47.997
Oh, could he?

09:48.030 --> 09:49.198
Okay, this is perfect.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.367
Okay.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.301
Oh, that's dirty.

09:52.334 --> 09:53.402
What? Who cares?

09:55.838 --> 09:56.705
Okay.

10:08.184 --> 10:09.451
The bastard got away.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.958
He has been trying to intimidate
us

10:15.991 --> 10:18.794
ever since I confronted him
about ramming into our tree.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.829
I'm sure you noticed the
damage when you came in.

10:20.863 --> 10:22.865
Officer Jones is speaking
with Mr. Brody now,

10:22.898 --> 10:24.200
but his wife confirms that he
was sleeping

10:24.233 --> 10:25.234
beside her the whole night.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.735
Well, of course she said that.

10:26.769 --> 10:27.970
She's the wife of a criminal!

10:28.003 --> 10:29.905
Brody is an electrical
engineer.

10:29.939 --> 10:31.907
He has no criminal
history, no prior arrests.

10:31.941 --> 10:34.443
So arrest him now
for trying to break in.

10:34.476 --> 10:35.411
And for rock throwing.

10:35.444 --> 10:36.278
And tree ramming!

10:36.312 --> 10:37.413
Unless you have proof-

10:37.446 --> 10:38.881
- Okay, okay.

10:38.914 --> 10:39.982
I just want...

10:40.015 --> 10:42.751
This is what it sounded like.

10:42.785 --> 10:43.953
You know, it sounded like this

10:43.986 --> 10:45.487
but it had more of a jingle...

10:45.521 --> 10:47.356
You know what, would you mind
getting on the other side?

10:47.389 --> 10:49.491
That won't be necessary.

10:50.426 --> 10:52.795
You know what he said to me
yesterday?

10:52.828 --> 10:55.264
All I did, I pushed
his boxes off the lawn-

10:55.297 --> 10:56.265
- Wait, wait, what?

10:57.967 --> 10:59.902
He told me to fuck off.

10:59.935 --> 11:02.438
I mean, is that any way
to talk to a neighbor?

11:05.341 --> 11:07.309
Well, what am I supposed to
do if this happens again?

11:07.343 --> 11:08.310
Get proof.

11:08.344 --> 11:09.912
There's not much we can
do without any evidence.

11:09.945 --> 11:11.080
That's what I told my
daughter.

11:11.113 --> 11:12.881
See, Melanie, we need to catch
him.

11:12.915 --> 11:13.782
All right then.

11:13.816 --> 11:15.017
Have a nice night.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.885
Yeah, it's a little late for
that!

11:18.354 --> 11:19.255
Aren't you scared

11:19.288 --> 11:19.888
that he's gonna murder you in
his sleep

11:19.922 --> 11:22.057
and bury you in his yard?

11:22.091 --> 11:23.325
Oh my god.

11:23.359 --> 11:24.860
Well, I wasn't until now.

11:25.928 --> 11:28.530
I watch a lot of late
night shows with my mom.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.765
Friggin' creepy.

11:29.798 --> 11:33.202
What I'll do is
just practice my karate moves.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.405
Oh yeah,
he should be really scared.

11:36.438 --> 11:37.806
Really scared.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.241
I know I'll scare him away.

11:43.012 --> 11:43.879
Oh my god!

11:47.016 --> 11:48.250
Does he not take a hint?

11:48.284 --> 11:50.252
Are those from Daniel?

11:50.286 --> 11:52.955
Yes, he's such a player.

11:52.988 --> 11:55.190
I bet he does this with every
girl.

11:55.224 --> 11:57.059
I wouldn't mind if he did it
to me.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.028
Among other things.

11:59.061 --> 12:01.130
Hey, aren't you with Jared?

12:01.163 --> 12:02.031
"With"?

12:03.165 --> 12:04.533
What does that even mean?

12:17.012 --> 12:17.880
Hey!

12:19.148 --> 12:21.083
You broke into my locker?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.318
Figured you're a size eight.

12:22.351 --> 12:23.620
I'm a five.

12:23.653 --> 12:24.721
You're a five?

12:24.754 --> 12:25.287
And don't
break into my locker again.

12:25.321 --> 12:26.889
That's a tiny foot.

12:26.922 --> 12:27.757
I should have shopped in kids.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.158
I would've been a hell of a lot
cheaper.

12:29.191 --> 12:30.492
Not as cheap as the Nine's.

12:32.561 --> 12:34.396
Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up.

12:34.430 --> 12:35.264
I've got a great idea.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.231
How 'bout we go get you

12:36.265 --> 12:38.967
those freakishly small fives
Friday night?

12:39.001 --> 12:39.769
I'm busy.

12:39.803 --> 12:41.937
I doubt that.
Saturday?

12:41.970 --> 12:43.038
No, I have plans.

12:43.072 --> 12:43.939
Sunday?

12:46.175 --> 12:47.443
My family's visiting.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.344
Who?

12:49.345 --> 12:50.179
Who?

12:50.212 --> 12:51.947
Yeah who? Who's
visiting?

12:51.980 --> 12:52.615
I'm not...

12:54.149 --> 12:54.950
I don't need to tell you that.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.418
You can't even think of a
name.

12:56.452 --> 12:58.253
My Aunt Delilah is coming,
okay?

12:58.287 --> 13:00.989
There's no such thing
as an Aunt Delilah.

13:01.023 --> 13:02.592
Maybe like a Grandma Delilah or-

13:02.625 --> 13:04.226
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:19.408 --> 13:21.210
To be continued.

13:21.243 --> 13:24.046
Nope. This is the end.

13:24.079 --> 13:26.448
Well then hey, give my
best to Auntie Delilah.

14:00.650 --> 14:01.316
Hello!

14:08.157 --> 14:10.727
How have I never seen this
before?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.561
It's my prom dress.

14:12.595 --> 14:14.096
I've been saving it for you.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.998
If you like it?

14:16.031 --> 14:18.467
Oh. I love it.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.335
I'll just take off the beads,

14:20.369 --> 14:22.070
and shorten it, and make it
orange.

14:24.139 --> 14:26.008
- I love it.
- I love you. I love you.

14:26.743 --> 14:27.610
Okay.

14:29.011 --> 14:30.112
Another rock.

14:31.648 --> 14:33.515
That was probably just a pine
cone.

14:33.549 --> 14:35.984
Why, why would he throw a pine
cone?

14:37.620 --> 14:39.288
Well, it fell off our tree.

14:39.321 --> 14:40.556
Come on, don't be
ridiculous.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.291
I know what a rock sounds like.

14:42.324 --> 14:44.526
It's the exact sound I heard
before.

14:47.563 --> 14:49.097
Well, did you see him
throw the first rock?

14:49.131 --> 14:51.533
How could I see him? I
had my back to the window.

14:51.567 --> 14:54.503
By the time I'd turned
around he'd ran away!

14:54.536 --> 14:57.640
But you did see him outside
the window last night, right?

14:57.674 --> 14:59.041
That's what you told the police.

14:59.074 --> 15:00.476
Think with your head.

15:00.509 --> 15:01.644
Who else would it be?

15:04.346 --> 15:05.180
Of course it's the afternoon,

15:05.214 --> 15:06.315
that's when he does it.

15:06.348 --> 15:09.218
He does it in the afternoons,
when he knows I'm home.

15:09.251 --> 15:11.353
He has a pattern.

15:15.557 --> 15:18.360
This day has been just
magical.

15:18.393 --> 15:21.029
The chemistry with Greg has been
just-

15:21.063 --> 15:22.364
- Study break.

15:22.397 --> 15:23.332
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.501
- You look amazing.
- Okay.

15:25.534 --> 15:26.435
So do you.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.503
You've been in the
before?

15:27.536 --> 15:28.771
Thanks.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.707
Okay, you're in for a
treat.

15:30.740 --> 15:34.811
I honestly didn't think I
would fall so fast for Greg.

15:34.844 --> 15:37.479
Both Gregs and Jason.

15:37.513 --> 15:39.114
Is there a guy she hasn't
kissed?

15:39.147 --> 15:43.218
I really need that
time to decide if Greg-

15:43.252 --> 15:46.589
- Honestly, if she doesn't pick
Jason,

15:46.623 --> 15:48.223
I'm never watching this show
again.

15:50.225 --> 15:51.527
Shh.

15:52.662 --> 15:54.764
You hear him walking?

15:54.797 --> 15:56.131
Where?

15:59.535 --> 16:00.469
The roof.

16:10.479 --> 16:13.282
Mom. This is ridiculous.

16:13.315 --> 16:14.784
Why would he be on the roof?

16:14.817 --> 16:17.687
I don't know how the
mind of a psychopath works.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.722
How do you
even get on the roof?

16:21.123 --> 16:21.925
I'll show you.

16:21.958 --> 16:23.826
What, you're going on the
roof?

16:23.860 --> 16:26.663
Melanie, remember what
the police officer said?

16:26.696 --> 16:27.830
We need to catch him.

16:31.266 --> 16:35.772
Watch the perimeters, okay?

16:35.805 --> 16:36.673
Okay.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.442
I got it.

16:40.475 --> 16:41.343
Yep.

17:01.664 --> 17:02.531
Mom?

17:06.736 --> 17:07.604
Mom?

17:11.340 --> 17:12.341
Mom!

17:13.843 --> 17:15.143
Goddammit! You were supposed
to monitor

17:15.177 --> 17:15.812
the sides of the house!

17:15.845 --> 17:16.813
We had a plan!

17:16.846 --> 17:18.748
Mom, how am I supposed
to watch all four sides?

17:18.781 --> 17:19.916
- I can't do it!
- Why did you start calling me

17:19.949 --> 17:20.850
like a fucking idiot!

17:20.883 --> 17:22.619
Mom, why are you so mad?

17:22.652 --> 17:23.820
Because he got away!

17:27.790 --> 17:30.392
Shh.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.528
I hear him.

17:33.562 --> 17:35.297
He's back, he's back on the
roof.

17:38.668 --> 17:39.602
Wait a minute.

17:42.739 --> 17:43.840
He's back.

17:43.873 --> 17:45.173
See, he's trying to torture me

17:45.207 --> 17:47.275
because I called the police on
him.

17:47.309 --> 17:49.277
It's a power struggle, Melanie,
you see?

17:49.311 --> 17:50.647
It's a power struggle.

17:51.681 --> 17:53.683
I'm gonna get you, you bastard.

17:53.716 --> 17:56.418
Leave us alone!

17:56.451 --> 17:57.654
Leave us alone!

18:00.355 --> 18:01.556
Leave us alone!

18:11.868 --> 18:15.504
Hi, my name is Melanie.

18:15.537 --> 18:16.906
I'm your neighbor's daughter.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.509
Is there any way I could
speak to your husband?

18:20.542 --> 18:22.310
Stop harassing him.

18:22.344 --> 18:23.412
He's not well.

18:23.445 --> 18:24.681
Okay, I'm sorry.

18:24.714 --> 18:27.482
I don't know why my mom thinks
your husband's targeting her.

18:27.516 --> 18:28.818
I think it's just anxiety.

18:28.851 --> 18:31.386
But if he could just go over

18:31.420 --> 18:32.521
and talk to her, that would be-

18:32.554 --> 18:34.724
- Go over and talk to her?

18:34.757 --> 18:36.959
He can't come within 10 feet of
her.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.362
She got a restraining order
against him.

18:41.363 --> 18:42.932
I didn't know that.

18:43.966 --> 18:47.369
Your mother is deeply
disturbed.

18:47.402 --> 18:50.338
You better deal with that before
things get out of control.

19:34.549 --> 19:38.020
I'm sorry if I scared
you with the broom.

19:41.758 --> 19:44.326
I'm not as strong as Dad.

19:44.359 --> 19:46.328
He would have known how to
handle this.

19:53.335 --> 19:55.905
Well, do you wanna talk to
someone?

19:55.938 --> 19:56.973
What do you mean?

19:59.876 --> 20:00.810
Well, this whole thing

20:00.843 --> 20:03.846
is causing you a lot of stress,

20:04.881 --> 20:07.617
and maybe it can help

20:07.650 --> 20:09.585
to talk to a therapist or
just...

20:10.586 --> 20:13.723
I do not need a therapist!

20:13.756 --> 20:16.058
Your generation,
someone looks at you

20:16.092 --> 20:18.094
the wrong way, you go
crying to a therapist.

20:18.127 --> 20:19.729
Yeah, but Mom...

20:20.596 --> 20:23.431
What if you're misinterpreting
some of the noises.

20:23.465 --> 20:25.902
If that's what you think,
then you need a shrink!

20:52.695 --> 20:53.562
Howdy.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.499
So now you're following me.

20:57.532 --> 21:00.837
I'm just here for my appointment
if that's okay with you.

21:00.870 --> 21:02.905
And what are you seeing him
for?

21:02.939 --> 21:04.439
Wouldn't you like to know.

21:05.141 --> 21:07.977
Mm. No, not really.

21:08.010 --> 21:08.811
Well if you must know,

21:08.845 --> 21:10.913
you see I have a crush on this
girl

21:10.947 --> 21:12.148
and she keeps on rejecting me,

21:12.181 --> 21:14.382
which is really adding
to my severe depression

21:14.416 --> 21:15.952
and very, very low self esteem.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.753
Very funny. You can go now.

21:22.859 --> 21:24.660
Okay, so I was kicked
out of three schools

21:24.694 --> 21:25.728
and after I got out of rehab,

21:25.761 --> 21:27.462
they said that I could
come here on the condition

21:27.495 --> 21:29.098
that I see a counselor once a
week.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.734
And is it helping?

21:31.767 --> 21:32.702
Yeah.

21:32.735 --> 21:33.803
I'd say he's come a long way

21:33.836 --> 21:35.037
since we started talking.

21:39.175 --> 21:40.408
So why rehab?

21:41.344 --> 21:43.179
Well, if you wanna know,
you'll have to go out with me.

21:43.212 --> 21:44.080
Pass.

21:47.049 --> 21:48.751
I'll think about it.

21:48.784 --> 21:50.953
Think about it over
dinner Saturday night.

21:59.128 --> 22:01.163
Why do I have you both down
for 12?

22:01.197 --> 22:02.064
Poor planning?

22:03.232 --> 22:04.066
Melanie, come on in.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.701
Daniel, I'll talk to you after,
okay?

22:05.735 --> 22:08.037
Don't worry, we'll
get through everything.

22:12.108 --> 22:14.110
Good for you for coming
here on your own volition.

22:14.143 --> 22:16.178
Usually I have to force
kids to come see me.

22:16.212 --> 22:18.014
So high five?

22:21.617 --> 22:23.052
Uh, where to begin?

22:23.085 --> 22:23.986
Uh, okay.

22:24.954 --> 22:26.055
I'm Mr. Wessler.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.658
This is a safe place.

22:28.691 --> 22:30.525
Everything you say to me is
confidential,

22:30.558 --> 22:31.594
unless you wanna like

22:31.627 --> 22:32.595
or.

22:32.628 --> 22:34.664
Then, I'm gonna have to
tell someone about that.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.168
I'm here because of my mom.

22:39.201 --> 22:40.069
Me too.

22:41.804 --> 22:45.641
Well, she thinks our
neighbor is stalking her and-

22:45.675 --> 22:46.976
- Oh, harming someone else,

22:47.009 --> 22:49.211
that's another reason I
would have to snitch on you.

22:49.245 --> 22:50.980
I'm sorry, what were you just
saying?

22:51.914 --> 22:54.216
Well, my mom is
convinced that our neighbor

22:54.250 --> 22:56.585
is trying to break into our
house,

22:56.619 --> 22:58.587
like, climbing on our roof.

22:58.621 --> 23:01.257
Every little noise she
believes is an attack.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.159
Is this a recent problem?

23:03.192 --> 23:05.661
There's never been
problems with neighbors.

23:07.730 --> 23:10.199
There were some fights with
co-workers.

23:10.232 --> 23:13.102
Like once she accused someone

23:13.135 --> 23:16.205
of blowing cigarette smoke
into her office vent.

23:16.238 --> 23:17.505
Stupid stuff.

23:17.539 --> 23:18.708
When was that?

23:18.741 --> 23:21.509
I think... two years ago?

23:22.979 --> 23:24.080
After my dad died.

23:25.982 --> 23:28.217
She's always been quirky,

23:28.250 --> 23:30.019
maybe a little neurotic.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.855
But nothing like this.

23:32.888 --> 23:37.093
Well, neurosis can sometimes
develop into psychosis.

23:37.126 --> 23:38.094
Well, she's not psychotic.

23:38.127 --> 23:39.295
It's okay to be angry.

23:39.328 --> 23:40.262
I'm not angry.

24:05.021 --> 24:06.922
Oh, I'm looking
at eating disorders.

24:06.956 --> 24:07.823
Uh...

24:10.292 --> 24:11.794
Here it is, okay.

24:13.596 --> 24:15.765
Right.

24:15.798 --> 24:19.101
Look, I can't diagnose
someone I haven't met,

24:19.135 --> 24:21.103
but based on what you're saying,

24:21.137 --> 24:22.038
it sounds like your mother

24:22.071 --> 24:27.143
has delusional disorder,
persecutory type.

24:27.843 --> 24:30.613
It's what's commonly known as
paranoia.

24:31.313 --> 24:32.715
It's like those people who think

24:32.748 --> 24:34.116
that the government is
trying to kill them.

24:34.150 --> 24:35.351
What is that Mel Gibson movie?

24:35.384 --> 24:38.721
Wait, how do I convince my
mom that it's all in her head?

24:38.754 --> 24:41.323
Um, that's gonna be hard.

24:42.058 --> 24:43.893
Because people with delusional
disorder

24:43.926 --> 24:46.195
are often the hardest to treat.

24:46.228 --> 24:47.797
Challenging their reality,

24:47.830 --> 24:49.899
because they don't believe
they have a problem,

24:49.932 --> 24:54.737
it almost always results
in hostility and rage.

24:54.770 --> 24:56.072
Okay so how do I help her?

24:57.206 --> 24:58.808
Please just tell me what to do.

24:58.841 --> 25:00.709
There might not be much you
can do.

25:01.877 --> 25:04.613
I'm not gonna sit back and do
nothing.

25:04.647 --> 25:07.149
Okay well, if loss and
loneliness

25:07.183 --> 25:10.152
are something that's
attributing to her anxiety,

25:10.186 --> 25:11.821
I guess, I guess you can
see what you could do

25:11.854 --> 25:13.889
about social life.

25:13.923 --> 25:18.828
The key is to just reduce
anxiety in her life.

25:20.863 --> 25:25.067
This is so stressful.

25:25.101 --> 25:25.801
Are you good?

25:30.339 --> 25:31.307
Ha!

25:31.340 --> 25:33.042
This is evidence.

25:33.075 --> 25:36.846
The asshole
planted bees in the house.

25:36.879 --> 25:38.247
It's proof he broke in.

25:39.882 --> 25:41.750
And how did he get past your
bolts?

25:46.255 --> 25:47.323
He's watching us.

25:48.457 --> 25:49.859
He's watching us.

25:51.827 --> 25:53.229
Yeah.

25:53.262 --> 25:54.763
I didn't even think of this.

25:56.832 --> 25:57.700
Okay.

26:01.170 --> 26:02.438
Let's get out of here.

26:02.471 --> 26:04.273
You're really scared, aren't
you?

26:06.308 --> 26:07.176
Yes.

26:19.889 --> 26:20.890
I like this place.

26:21.790 --> 26:22.958
It's so happy.

26:22.992 --> 26:24.760
Not for the people who work
here.

26:25.828 --> 26:28.030
Mom, can I show you something?

26:28.063 --> 26:30.166
♪ Come here, baby ♪

26:30.199 --> 26:32.434
♪ Roll, don't come up to move ♪

26:32.468 --> 26:33.969
♪ Takin' it slow ♪

26:34.003 --> 26:35.471
A dating site?

26:35.504 --> 26:37.206
Why did you do this without
telling me?

26:37.239 --> 26:38.107
Please don't be mad.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.975
Look how many messages you
already got.

26:41.343 --> 26:43.112
I know exactly what you're
doing.

26:44.079 --> 26:45.114
You think I'm stupid?

26:46.849 --> 26:48.184
You're doing this so you won't
feel so bad

26:48.217 --> 26:49.952
when you go off to USC.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.387
Well too bad.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.389
There is no replacement for you
or Dad.

26:53.422 --> 26:55.157
Have it your way.

26:55.191 --> 26:56.225
An amazing man could have
written you

26:56.258 --> 26:58.360
but you'll never know,
because you're being you.

26:58.394 --> 27:00.496
Well, if me being me is the
problem,

27:00.529 --> 27:02.798
then it's not meant
to be.

27:02.831 --> 27:03.699
What?

27:04.967 --> 27:06.001
Whatever.

27:06.035 --> 27:07.836
I read your messages but
I guess you'll never know.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.872
Well, you shouldn't
be reading my messages.

27:09.905 --> 27:10.773
Fine.

27:10.806 --> 27:12.007
I'll delete your profile.

27:15.778 --> 27:18.747
Okay look, if they've
already written, it's...

27:19.848 --> 27:22.785
So Howard is my favorite.

27:22.818 --> 27:25.821
He loves cooking, dancing,
hiking.

27:25.854 --> 27:26.522
Oh, hiking?

27:26.555 --> 27:27.856
Okay, he wants someone athletic.

27:27.890 --> 27:28.524
- I'm not athletic.
- No no no.

27:28.557 --> 27:29.325
It's not gonna work.

27:29.358 --> 27:29.992
Everybody says they love
hiking.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.493
Nobody actually goes hiking.

27:32.461 --> 27:33.963
♪ Keep on rollin' ♪

27:33.996 --> 27:35.965
He's a systems analyst.

27:35.998 --> 27:37.900
He's probably intelligent.

27:37.933 --> 27:40.202
Yeah, with
those glasses, for sure.

27:41.237 --> 27:42.471
Like I said...

27:42.504 --> 27:43.939
Are you going to let me finish?

27:43.973 --> 27:46.775
Look, my client wasn't even...

27:46.809 --> 27:48.944
May I finish?

27:48.978 --> 27:50.512
My client is not...

27:52.281 --> 27:55.150
Christ, Jerry, I'll call you
back.

27:56.452 --> 27:58.354
Oh, you didn't have to hang up
for me.

28:00.923 --> 28:04.793
So, I'm living next to a lunatic
stalker.

28:04.827 --> 28:06.028
Is this a personal problem?

28:06.061 --> 28:08.998
Because this doesn't sound
work-related.

28:09.031 --> 28:11.166
Oh no, no. No, it is
work-related.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.936
I have a new client for you.

28:13.969 --> 28:15.471
Well, I'll be the judge of
that.

28:15.504 --> 28:17.406
Um, where's the file?

28:17.439 --> 28:18.307
It's me.

28:22.244 --> 28:26.215
My neighbor, I am talking
harassment, home invasion-

28:26.248 --> 28:27.549
- Contact the police, all right?

28:27.584 --> 28:28.585
But after work hours.

28:28.618 --> 28:30.252
No no, I already did that.

28:30.286 --> 28:34.123
This guy, he is so
sneaky, he is so clever.

28:34.156 --> 28:37.426
He knows exactly what to
do to avoid getting caught.

28:38.927 --> 28:42.431
I have prepared a list
of everything he's done.

28:42.464 --> 28:45.501
Did you also prepare the
Dodson brief I asked for?

28:45.534 --> 28:46.368
On Monday?

28:46.402 --> 28:49.838
Yesterday he broke into our
house.

28:49.872 --> 28:52.308
I have proof because I captured
the bees

28:52.341 --> 28:53.375
that he placed there.

28:55.244 --> 28:57.279
Yes, I know. He's a maniac.

28:59.515 --> 29:01.250
Look, look what I found in his
mailbox.

29:01.283 --> 29:02.484
You opened his mail?

29:02.518 --> 29:04.286
Don't get sidetracked.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.221
Brody is taking psychiatric meds

29:06.255 --> 29:08.290
which tells you that
he has mental problems.

29:08.324 --> 29:11.126
This is Metoprolol, this
is for high blood pressure.

29:11.927 --> 29:15.397
You realize that postal theft
is a federal offense, right?

29:15.431 --> 29:18.367
Well, good thing I have a
lawyer.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.568
Dawn...

29:19.602 --> 29:21.003
I...

29:21.036 --> 29:23.872
I am not taking on new cases.

29:23.906 --> 29:26.208
You have half the case
load you had last year.

29:28.110 --> 29:28.977
Yeah.

29:32.214 --> 29:34.350
I'm sorry, Dawn, I can't help
you.

29:34.383 --> 29:35.884
You can't help me.

29:39.054 --> 29:39.922
Well...

29:43.258 --> 29:44.960
I can't help you either.

29:54.103 --> 29:55.938
Are you gonna get that?

29:55.971 --> 29:59.108
I'll get it when I'm good and
ready.

30:03.713 --> 30:04.546
Leave the door

30:04.581 --> 30:07.015
open.

30:07.049 --> 30:07.950
Open.

30:13.555 --> 30:14.624
He was intimidated.

30:15.424 --> 30:17.126
Bill's always been a bit of a
coward.

30:17.159 --> 30:19.328
But you could just tell
by the look on his face

30:19.361 --> 30:21.530
that he was just stunned
by what's going on.

30:22.364 --> 30:25.668
Mom, maybe don't
bring this up to Howard?

30:25.702 --> 30:27.604
I tell it like it is.

30:27.637 --> 30:30.372
Right. So can you
not tell it like it is?

30:30.406 --> 30:32.374
Melanie, I don't tell you what
to do.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.978
You look pale. Put some rouge
on.

30:36.679 --> 30:37.513
Oh they're here.

30:37.546 --> 30:38.480
- Wait.
- Oh god.

30:38.514 --> 30:40.382
Okay, wait.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.685
Okay, let's take a look. Come
on.

30:47.423 --> 30:48.090
Oh! Howard has money.

30:48.123 --> 30:50.426
No no no, that's Daniel's car.

30:50.459 --> 30:52.127
Oh, well that doesn't look
safe.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.672
Oh, Daniel's so cute.

31:02.705 --> 31:05.307
Mom, Howard looks
like such a nice person.

31:07.476 --> 31:09.144
Mom, please don't ask
a million questions.

31:09.178 --> 31:11.013
Oh come on now, give me some
credit.

31:13.515 --> 31:14.450
- Hey, I'm Howard.
- Hi.

31:14.483 --> 31:16.452
- Hi, Howard. Hi.
- Hi.

31:16.485 --> 31:18.120
Hi, I'm Melanie.

31:18.153 --> 31:18.987
Hi, nice to meet you.

31:19.021 --> 31:19.722
Nice to meet you.

31:19.756 --> 31:21.156
Does anyone call you Danny?

31:21.190 --> 31:22.491
Not really ma'am, no.

31:22.524 --> 31:23.192
Where are your parents from?

31:23.225 --> 31:24.727
You don't have to answer that.

31:24.761 --> 31:26.295
Around here, actually.

31:26.328 --> 31:28.297
Dawn, you didn't tell
me you had a sister.

31:30.399 --> 31:31.400
I mean because you look young.

31:31.433 --> 31:32.702
Not that you look old.

31:34.704 --> 31:35.605
Here you go.

31:35.638 --> 31:36.606
Lovely.

31:36.639 --> 31:38.207
Oh, they're her favorite.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.308
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

31:39.341 --> 31:40.743
The orange one.

31:40.777 --> 31:42.511
Daniel, what do your parents
do?

31:42.544 --> 31:43.378
- My dad is a-
- Howard, what do

31:43.412 --> 31:44.246
your parents do?

31:44.279 --> 31:45.380
Oh, um...

31:45.414 --> 31:47.349
Well, they're in an old age
home,

31:47.382 --> 31:49.518
uh so, I don't know...

31:49.551 --> 31:50.419
Triathlons?

31:51.553 --> 31:53.555
Melanie does not like that
I ask so many questions.

31:53.590 --> 31:55.090
But I can't help it. I'm
inquisitive.

31:55.123 --> 31:55.892
Hey, I think that's great.

31:55.925 --> 31:57.627
- Yeah.
- Well thank you, Howard.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.228
- Yeah.
- See Howard gets it.

31:59.261 --> 32:00.663
Well, Howard's cool.

32:00.697 --> 32:03.532
So are we all going out
together?

32:03.565 --> 32:04.566
No.

32:04.601 --> 32:05.467
Love you.

32:06.769 --> 32:07.637
Bye, Howard.

32:07.670 --> 32:08.738
She loves dancing.

32:08.771 --> 32:09.505
- Good to know, good to know.
- Nice to meet you.

32:09.538 --> 32:10.740
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.474
Nice to meet you.

32:15.612 --> 32:17.546
Oh... nice kids.

32:25.822 --> 32:28.323
So, is this
tomato shirt orchestrated?

32:28.357 --> 32:29.024
No, I didn't know

32:29.057 --> 32:30.025
I was gonna be eating tomatoes.

32:30.058 --> 32:32.494
I didn't even know I was
gonna be coming here.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.463
Thank you.

32:34.496 --> 32:39.501
Thank you.

32:42.839 --> 32:44.139
Would you like any?

32:45.675 --> 32:49.344
Oh, um. I don't really drink.

32:49.378 --> 32:51.313
In Europe they have a bottle
of wine

32:51.346 --> 32:53.448
with like every meal.

32:56.786 --> 32:58.821
Is that why you were in rehab?

33:01.824 --> 33:06.261
I mean, last year I
went kinda crazy, yeah,

33:06.295 --> 33:08.564
but now I know how to handle
myself.

33:08.598 --> 33:10.332
Well, what do your parents
say?

33:12.134 --> 33:13.736
Beer before wine, you'll be
fine.

33:18.608 --> 33:23.111
Um... my mom, she uh,

33:23.145 --> 33:24.647
she drinks like a fish,

33:24.681 --> 33:27.516
so she doesn't really get a say.

33:27.549 --> 33:31.386
And my dad, he's abroad most of
the year.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.624
But he did have his assistant

33:34.657 --> 33:35.625
call me when I was in rehab,

33:35.658 --> 33:39.094
so he obviously like,
really cares, you know.

33:40.295 --> 33:41.631
How's the food?

33:41.664 --> 33:42.497
Amazing.

33:42.531 --> 33:43.600
No good.

33:43.633 --> 33:45.602
You see, I ordered it medium
rare and it came medium.

33:45.635 --> 33:46.736
You guys did this last time.

33:46.769 --> 33:48.871
I apologize, we can certainly
get that redone for you.

33:48.905 --> 33:49.772
Well, then instead of eating

33:49.806 --> 33:51.306
with my beautiful girlfriend

33:51.340 --> 33:52.875
I'll have to wait 20
minutes for a new steak.

33:52.909 --> 33:53.743
So no thank you.

33:53.776 --> 33:55.510
I'm sorry, we'll take it off
the tab.

33:55.544 --> 33:57.179
How about a free dessert too?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.782
I love the chocolate
mousse you guys have here.

33:59.816 --> 34:00.783
It's fantastic.

34:01.718 --> 34:04.921
Did you see how I slipped in
the word girlfriend into that?

34:04.954 --> 34:07.389
A bit presumptuous.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.491
Not a presumption.

34:09.524 --> 34:10.392
A prediction.

34:18.735 --> 34:20.569
The fettuccine alfredo looks
good.

34:21.771 --> 34:23.572
Do you have high cholesterol?

34:23.606 --> 34:24.473
Um...

34:25.440 --> 34:27.376
I'm borderline.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.177
Yeah, fettuccine alfredo,

34:29.211 --> 34:31.413
it's loaded with saturated fats

34:31.446 --> 34:32.849
that clog your arteries.

34:32.882 --> 34:35.183
Oh, okay.

34:35.217 --> 34:35.885
Interesting.

34:36.786 --> 34:40.555
I'll have the Cobb salad.

34:40.590 --> 34:43.425
Oh, bacon, it's worse than the
alfredo.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.527
- Jeez.
- Yeah.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.797
Have you always
been this health conscious?

34:47.830 --> 34:49.699
No, no, not particularly.

34:49.732 --> 34:50.600
It's just...

34:51.701 --> 34:54.202
I don't know, when Charles,

34:54.236 --> 34:56.438
you know, a perfectly healthy
56-year-old

34:56.471 --> 34:59.642
suddenly passes away, it makes
you wonder

34:59.676 --> 35:01.343
what's gonna happen to the rest
of us.

35:01.376 --> 35:02.244
Yeah.

35:03.245 --> 35:03.913
I'm sorry.

35:05.313 --> 35:06.181
Yeah.

35:06.983 --> 35:11.788
Hey, I have to say, I just
love your profile picture.

35:11.821 --> 35:13.990
You look so happy in it.

35:14.023 --> 35:15.557
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.660
Well, I'm really
happy

35:17.694 --> 35:19.194
to be here with you tonight.

35:33.976 --> 35:35.011
No! I don't mean

35:35.044 --> 35:36.478
what's wrong with you.

35:39.514 --> 35:41.718
Why? Is there something wrong
with you?

35:42.484 --> 35:47.590
Well, I was married for 21
years.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.458
And I lost her.

35:49.491 --> 35:51.359
Oh. You're a widower too.

35:52.061 --> 35:56.264
No. I lost her to our
financial advisor.

35:56.298 --> 35:57.332
Yeah.

35:57.365 --> 36:00.502
Sheila had been having
an affair for three years

36:00.535 --> 36:02.437
before I figured it out.

36:02.471 --> 36:03.505
- Uh.
- Yeah.

36:03.538 --> 36:05.742
And then she screwed me

36:05.775 --> 36:08.343
out of every penny I ever had.

36:09.478 --> 36:10.747
Yeah.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.882
Well, she had a good financial
advisor.

36:16.853 --> 36:17.687
Yes, she did.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.888
Too good. Too good.

36:20.823 --> 36:22.592
- And maybe.
- This is good.

36:22.625 --> 36:23.960
Solid. Nicely done.

36:23.993 --> 36:24.827
We made it.

36:24.861 --> 36:26.062
Great job.

36:26.095 --> 36:28.731
You know, I think I drive better
drunk than you drive sober.

36:28.765 --> 36:29.799
I am a good driver.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.603
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:33.636 --> 36:34.536
There we go.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.906
There we go. Oh, I have
something for you.

36:36.939 --> 36:37.774
What?

36:37.807 --> 36:38.741
Yep.

36:38.775 --> 36:40.575
Okay, close your eyes.

36:40.610 --> 36:41.778
Hold out your hand.

36:41.811 --> 36:42.678
Okay.

36:47.650 --> 36:48.684
- Daniel.
- Open it.

36:49.852 --> 36:50.720
Oh my god.

36:51.988 --> 36:53.689
They may be a tiny bit big.

36:53.723 --> 36:54.857
You got these just for the
joke?

36:54.891 --> 36:55.858
Absolutely.

36:56.793 --> 36:57.627
Wait.

36:57.660 --> 36:58.460
I got something else.

36:58.493 --> 36:59.327
I'll trade you.

37:02.497 --> 37:03.365
Oh.

37:07.603 --> 37:08.470
Thank you.

37:10.039 --> 37:12.340
Thank you for the shoes and for
dinner.

37:13.075 --> 37:14.744
And for always making fun of me.

37:14.777 --> 37:15.645
My pleasure.

37:27.690 --> 37:29.659
Are you sure you're okay to
drive?

37:29.692 --> 37:32.128
You know actually I
think I should sleep over.

37:32.161 --> 37:33.729
Okay.

37:33.763 --> 37:35.397
I can set up the couch for you.

37:36.431 --> 37:38.134
I think I just sobered up.

37:38.167 --> 37:40.002
Okay.

37:41.604 --> 37:42.504
Hey, good night.

37:43.572 --> 37:44.506
Good night.

37:54.951 --> 37:57.552
Ooh, originally $87.

37:57.587 --> 37:58.955
No, don't fall for that.

37:58.988 --> 38:00.388
They put that number there on
purpose

38:00.422 --> 38:02.390
to make you feel like
you're getting a deal.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.629
Did you know Howard's
brother works in advertising?

38:06.662 --> 38:09.165
And did you know they
put clear shoe polish

38:09.198 --> 38:11.767
on the food to make it
shiny in commercials?

38:13.169 --> 38:14.536
Isn't Howard great?

38:15.470 --> 38:16.806
So full of facts.

38:21.878 --> 38:23.045
He took me to Jory's.

38:23.079 --> 38:25.047
Oh, that's nice.

38:26.182 --> 38:28.084
What about you, where'd you
go?

38:28.117 --> 38:29.685
Um...

38:29.719 --> 38:30.586
Copa.

38:32.487 --> 38:33.388
Copa?

38:34.624 --> 38:37.593
Yeah, I know.

38:37.627 --> 38:39.061
I know, it really wasn't
that great though.

38:39.095 --> 38:40.129
The steaks were overcooked.

38:40.162 --> 38:42.632
Oh, food snob.

38:46.969 --> 38:49.639
Well, aren't you glad
you gave Howard a chance?

38:51.741 --> 38:53.809
You know, I's kind of
accepted I'd be alone

38:53.843 --> 38:55.778
for the rest of my life but
now...

38:55.811 --> 38:56.712
Mm.

38:56.746 --> 38:57.580
Who knows?

38:57.613 --> 38:58.714
You're welcome!

38:59.514 --> 39:01.617
So come on now, gimme
some juice on Danny.

39:01.651 --> 39:03.953
Hm, all's good.

39:03.986 --> 39:07.156
Oh, come on now, I need
more than that to work with.

39:07.189 --> 39:09.557
What's his relationship
like with his mother?

39:09.592 --> 39:12.028
I don't know, I
haven't cross-examined him.

39:12.862 --> 39:15.998
You should wear this
tonight.

39:17.199 --> 39:18.466
Come on.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.567
Ah, it's too short.

39:19.602 --> 39:20.236
No it's not.

39:20.269 --> 39:21.137
It's too sexy.

39:21.170 --> 39:22.672
Mm-mm.

39:22.705 --> 39:23.839
It's three bucks.

39:23.873 --> 39:24.740
- You're getting it.

Can I sleep at your house
tonight?

41:19.955 --> 41:22.024
Yes.

41:24.160 --> 41:26.062
Oh, I'm gonna fix that.

41:26.095 --> 41:28.731
Don't stare at anything
too long.

41:28.764 --> 41:29.632
Okay.

41:46.115 --> 41:48.984
Oh, oh, that looks like a sturdy
gate.

41:49.018 --> 41:50.753
Oh, thanks. Home Depot.

41:51.454 --> 41:53.122
Looks like it'd be
hard

41:53.155 --> 41:54.356
for someone to climb over that.

42:03.365 --> 42:05.301
You know what? One sec.

42:09.371 --> 42:10.773
That way no one can hear us.

42:10.806 --> 42:14.877
Ah. I like that.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.782
Oh wait, do you have an alarm
system?

42:19.815 --> 42:21.050
Uh, yeah.

42:21.083 --> 42:23.385
Well, I hope it's not EAP

42:23.419 --> 42:24.987
'cause they're not reliable.

42:27.156 --> 42:31.127
Uh, hey, maybe we'd be more
comfortable in the bedroom.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.194
I have coasters.

42:33.929 --> 42:34.864
Howard.

42:34.897 --> 42:35.764
Yeah.

42:35.798 --> 42:37.266
Wait, are you trying to sleep
with me?

42:38.134 --> 42:41.303
Well, you did ask to sleep
over. Yeah.

42:42.271 --> 42:43.139
Uh.

42:44.740 --> 42:45.841
Okay, here's the thing...

42:45.875 --> 42:46.909
Oh.

42:46.942 --> 42:48.110
The thing is...

42:51.780 --> 42:54.850
What?

42:54.884 --> 42:56.285
This thing is...

42:58.020 --> 43:02.258
my head started to hurt
really bad at the bar.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.125
I have some Advil.

43:03.159 --> 43:05.194
No, it's, it's it's...

43:07.296 --> 43:09.932
No, I realized Brody,

43:09.965 --> 43:10.933
he's my neighbor,

43:11.800 --> 43:16.338
he's causing me pain through
electromagnetic devices,

43:16.372 --> 43:17.873
wavelengths, whatever-

43:17.907 --> 43:18.974
What?

43:19.008 --> 43:22.411
He is a sick man, but
he's an electrical engineer,

43:22.444 --> 43:24.413
a devious one, and he built

43:24.446 --> 43:26.081
an electrical device

43:26.115 --> 43:28.184
to trigger pain in my body.

43:31.655 --> 43:34.089
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
I know what you're thinking.

43:34.123 --> 43:36.992
Who can truly understand
the mysteries of the mind,

43:37.026 --> 43:39.195
especially the mind of a
sociopath?

43:39.228 --> 43:40.496
Not me.

43:40.529 --> 43:43.832
But what I do know is he's
expecting me to come home tonight

43:43.866 --> 43:46.235
so if I sleep here, it will foil
his plan.

43:51.207 --> 43:55.978
Uh...

43:59.481 --> 44:04.119
This is a lot to wrap my
head around.

44:04.153 --> 44:06.121
- Um...
- Ooh.

44:06.155 --> 44:08.791
Look, I've gotta
finish some work tonight.

44:08.824 --> 44:10.159
Why don't um...

44:10.192 --> 44:11.760
Why don't I drive you home,

44:11.794 --> 44:15.998
and we'll continue this at
another time?

44:16.031 --> 44:16.899
Okay?

44:20.536 --> 44:23.405
Okay, I know what's going on.

44:23.439 --> 44:25.808
Now that I'm not gonna sleep
with you,

44:25.841 --> 44:27.276
you're no longer interested.

44:27.309 --> 44:29.078
No, no no no.

44:29.111 --> 44:30.913
Dawn, at least let me drive you
home.

44:30.946 --> 44:32.014
Fuck you, Howard.

44:32.047 --> 44:33.482
You're not a quality man.

44:52.434 --> 44:53.302
Dawn.

44:55.437 --> 44:56.305
Dawn.

44:58.307 --> 44:59.942
Dawn! Come on, hey!

45:01.977 --> 45:04.513
Oh okay.

45:05.514 --> 45:06.448
Um...

45:09.118 --> 45:10.819
Oh, you have no messages.

45:10.853 --> 45:15.024
And I pushed your 1:00 to
go after your lunch meeting-

45:15.057 --> 45:15.958
- Dawn.

45:15.991 --> 45:18.294
Do you have that same shirt in
charcoal?

45:18.327 --> 45:20.496
I like the other one better
because it covers your stomach.

45:20.529 --> 45:22.965
Did you sleep here last
night?

45:22.998 --> 45:23.999
Uh, what?

45:27.403 --> 45:28.270
Oh no.

45:29.438 --> 45:31.140
My neighbor, my lunatic
neighbor,

45:31.173 --> 45:33.442
he's terrorizing me at home.

45:33.475 --> 45:34.376
Where was I supposed to
go?

45:34.410 --> 45:36.111
I think you should go home.

45:36.145 --> 45:37.479
Are you listening to
anything that I'm saying?

45:37.513 --> 45:38.280
I can't go home.

45:38.314 --> 45:39.181
- I can't go home!
- Well, you can't,

45:39.214 --> 45:40.015
you can't-
You're not hearing me Bill!

45:40.049 --> 45:41.517
You can't stay here
either.

45:41.550 --> 45:42.518
So let's...

45:44.086 --> 45:45.888
Oh, you think he's gonna come
after you?

45:45.921 --> 45:47.423
Oh no, don't, he doesn't know
I'm here.

45:47.456 --> 45:49.091
Dawn, this is not working out.

45:49.124 --> 45:50.326
Look, I can get fresh linens,

45:50.359 --> 45:52.194
your couch, it'll be untouched.

45:52.227 --> 45:53.429
- They'll never know.
- I don't know

45:53.462 --> 45:55.297
what's happening to you, but
I don't want any part of this.

45:55.331 --> 45:56.165
Oh, you're firing me?

45:56.198 --> 45:58.534
You're firing me? After six
years!

45:58.567 --> 46:01.070
Six years, I've worked my ass
off for you!

46:01.103 --> 46:02.571
Six years, and that's...

46:05.274 --> 46:07.242
Did he... did he threaten you?

46:07.276 --> 46:08.344
Who? What?

46:08.377 --> 46:09.579
Brody I'm talking about!

46:09.612 --> 46:11.013
He got to you, didn't he?

46:11.914 --> 46:13.048
He got to you.

46:13.082 --> 46:13.717
You're a coward.

46:13.750 --> 46:14.584
You've always been a coward.

46:14.617 --> 46:16.085
That's why you lost the Benville
case.

46:16.118 --> 46:17.219
You have no empathy for me,

46:17.252 --> 46:18.420
you have no empathy for Linda.

46:18.454 --> 46:19.088
Get your things and go.

46:19.121 --> 46:21.190
No, you know what? I quit.

46:21.223 --> 46:22.592
I quit, Bill.

46:22.625 --> 46:23.525
How's that?

46:24.426 --> 46:27.496
Go to Robbins, he's a much
better lawyer across the hall.

46:30.566 --> 46:32.000
Much better lawyer!

46:34.236 --> 46:35.537
Mom, what the hell?

46:35.571 --> 46:36.673
I'm gonna be late!

46:36.706 --> 46:38.974
You slept at Howard's?

46:39.007 --> 46:40.976
Mom, what were you thinking, I
gotta go!

46:41.009 --> 46:42.411
Oh, stop, stop!

46:42.444 --> 46:44.947
Mom, please! We need to leave!

46:44.980 --> 46:46.448
Give me just a second, okay?

46:46.482 --> 46:47.349
Just...

46:48.317 --> 46:49.918
Goddammit.

46:49.952 --> 46:51.186
Okay.

46:51.220 --> 46:52.689
Come on, Mom, we
need to go.

46:52.722 --> 46:54.189
I can't be late for my test.

46:54.223 --> 46:55.190
Just forget it.

46:55.224 --> 46:56.258
You don't have to go today.

46:56.291 --> 46:58.695
Mom, yes I do. I have an
AP exam in half an hour!

46:58.728 --> 46:59.596
And we still have to pick up
Lacy.

46:59.629 --> 47:01.363
So why didn't you call and
remind me?

47:01.397 --> 47:03.332
Remind you
to take me to school?

47:03.365 --> 47:05.033
I am in no mood for your
attitude.

47:05.067 --> 47:07.403
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through?

47:07.436 --> 47:10.372
Did it even occur to you that
I just got fired from my job?

47:13.242 --> 47:14.109
No.

47:15.678 --> 47:16.512
What happened?

47:17.747 --> 47:20.983
That son of a bitch. He got to
Bill!

47:26.623 --> 47:28.223
How was your date with Howard?

47:28.257 --> 47:30.559
He's a sleaze. He's just after
a fuck.

47:40.603 --> 47:41.503
What are you doing?

47:41.537 --> 47:42.404
Trying to lose him.

47:42.438 --> 47:43.372
Who?

47:43.405 --> 47:45.675
Brody, our neighbor, he's
following us.

47:45.708 --> 47:47.209
Still? That's crazy!

47:47.242 --> 47:48.210
It's a nightmare.

47:51.648 --> 47:53.115
What are you doing? You passed
it!

47:53.148 --> 47:54.450
Yeah I did, because I don't
want him

47:54.483 --> 47:55.284
to know where you're going.

47:55.317 --> 47:56.185
Mom, I'm going to miss my
test.

47:56.218 --> 47:56.886
God, all you care about is
yourself.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.622
I'm being persecuted here, okay?

47:59.656 --> 48:01.190
Do you understand that?

48:21.510 --> 48:22.612
Bye.

48:22.645 --> 48:23.780
Welcome, you have appointment?

48:23.813 --> 48:24.747
I need to talk to Bill.

48:24.781 --> 48:27.617
Well, there is no
Bill here. Only William.

48:27.650 --> 48:28.550
Bill Hoffman!

48:29.686 --> 48:31.086
Bill is William?

48:32.421 --> 48:34.490
Oye, I have to call all these
people back.

48:34.523 --> 48:35.324
I'm only a temp.

48:35.357 --> 48:37.292
William fire some crazy lady
and...

48:37.326 --> 48:38.193
Hey!

48:39.194 --> 48:40.329
Why did you fire my mom?

48:40.362 --> 48:41.230
- Okay.
- I try to stop her

48:41.263 --> 48:42.331
but she run from me.

48:42.364 --> 48:43.031
Why you do that?

48:43.065 --> 48:45.033
Ronit, please. Thank you.

48:47.637 --> 48:50.172
Close the... close the...

48:50.205 --> 48:52.107
I'm running a business here.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.610
She can't sleep in my office.

48:53.643 --> 48:54.677
She slept here?

48:54.711 --> 48:56.746
Among other peculiar
behaviors.

48:56.779 --> 48:57.614
Have you seen this?

48:57.647 --> 48:59.481
This is what she gives me. Take
a look.

48:59.515 --> 49:02.150
And there are stacks of these on
her desk.

49:04.687 --> 49:05.722
Well, she really needs a job.

49:05.755 --> 49:07.422
She already has a job.

49:10.860 --> 49:11.761
Please.

49:13.161 --> 49:15.197
Can you just give her another
chance?

49:15.230 --> 49:18.166
I have given her so many
chances.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.568
To be honest,

49:19.602 --> 49:22.437
if it weren't for what
happened to your dad,

49:22.471 --> 49:24.239
I would have fired her a long
time ago.

49:24.273 --> 49:26.776
Yeah but this has only been
happening for a few days.

49:26.809 --> 49:28.143
A few days?

49:28.176 --> 49:29.779
Where have you been?

49:29.812 --> 49:30.647
What do you mean?

49:30.680 --> 49:32.314
Okay, so that means she didn't
tell you

49:32.347 --> 49:34.684
about the water delivery
guy, is that right?

49:34.717 --> 49:38.220
God only knows what she thought
the guy did to the water.

49:38.253 --> 49:40.790
Now this whole deal with the
neighbor.

49:40.823 --> 49:43.125
I mean...

49:44.293 --> 49:45.628
She's off the edge.

50:02.645 --> 50:03.780
I don't believe...

50:03.813 --> 50:04.681
Hey!

50:07.549 --> 50:08.417
I caught you!

50:10.552 --> 50:11.353
Mom?

50:11.386 --> 50:12.454
Melanie!

50:12.487 --> 50:13.322
Are you okay?

50:13.355 --> 50:14.023
- Yeah.
- I saw him!

50:14.057 --> 50:15.524
- I saw him, up there.
- Yeah.

50:17.727 --> 50:19.328
Can I get you some coffee?

50:20.429 --> 50:21.598
What?

50:21.631 --> 50:23.265
You have any almond milk?

50:23.298 --> 50:24.132
Sure.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.567
What's happening?

50:25.602 --> 50:27.737
I hired a private
investigator.

50:27.770 --> 50:29.571
You're gonna need at least six
cameras

50:29.606 --> 50:31.741
to cover all the angles.

50:31.774 --> 50:33.508
And we should probably go with
HD.

50:33.542 --> 50:35.310
It's a bit pricey,

50:35.344 --> 50:36.679
but you need the high res.

50:36.713 --> 50:37.714
You're the expert.

50:37.747 --> 50:38.781
I'll get your coffee.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.822
How much are you paying him?

50:49.257 --> 50:50.225
You're cranky.

50:50.258 --> 50:51.594
What, do you think you
failed your test today?

50:51.628 --> 50:52.795
No, I missed it.

50:52.829 --> 50:54.463
We were an hour late, remember?

50:55.865 --> 50:57.767
Mom, just tell me, is it
hundreds?

50:57.800 --> 50:58.668
Thousands?

51:04.539 --> 51:05.642
5,000, okay?

51:05.675 --> 51:06.643
You know why?

51:06.676 --> 51:08.577
Because I don't put a
price on peace of mind.

51:08.611 --> 51:10.479
Mom, you are throwing away our
savings!

51:10.512 --> 51:12.649
Look, we need a top
professional for this job.

51:16.551 --> 51:17.620
I'll give it to him.

51:32.434 --> 51:34.403
You know that there's nobody
after her.

51:35.838 --> 51:37.172
She just lost her job.

51:38.808 --> 51:40.810
And we don't have any money.

51:40.843 --> 51:42.645
Got any Stevia? I forgot to
ask.

51:46.314 --> 51:47.650
She's paying me to follow him.

51:47.684 --> 51:48.718
I can't take the money and not
do it.

51:48.751 --> 51:50.552
Well then don't take the
money.

51:50.586 --> 51:52.789
I can't follow him for free.

51:52.822 --> 51:54.590
Don't follow him!

51:54.624 --> 51:56.558
Listen, I got an idea.

51:58.527 --> 52:00.663
Why don't you put on
something nice, right,

52:00.697 --> 52:02.464
go talk to your neighbor.

52:02.497 --> 52:04.433
Say, hey, how are you?

52:05.868 --> 52:08.470
Then you say, come over,
talk to my mom, you know,

52:08.503 --> 52:10.673
and put out like peanuts.

52:10.707 --> 52:11.641
Right?

52:11.674 --> 52:13.241
And he can tell your mom, look
sweetheart,

52:13.275 --> 52:14.443
I'm not the boogeyman.

52:16.579 --> 52:17.446
No?

52:17.479 --> 52:18.715
What's your name?

52:18.748 --> 52:19.582
Gary.

52:19.615 --> 52:20.449
Gary, okay.

52:20.482 --> 52:22.317
He won't talk to my mom.

52:22.350 --> 52:23.753
She got a restraining order
against him.

52:23.786 --> 52:24.453
And you know what you're doing?

52:24.486 --> 52:26.656
You are adding fuel to the fire.

52:26.689 --> 52:28.390
Oh, no, honey, what I'm doing
is,

52:28.423 --> 52:29.524
I'm just doing my job.

52:29.558 --> 52:32.929
You're taking advantage
of a mentally ill person.

52:32.962 --> 52:33.996
I can report you.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.267
Okay.

52:40.903 --> 52:43.238
When you're done with your
investigation,

52:44.207 --> 52:46.475
you're gonna do whatever
it takes to prove to my mom

52:46.508 --> 52:48.678
that nobody is stalking her.

52:48.711 --> 52:49.579
Fine.

52:50.378 --> 52:52.582
But I'm gonna need a fresh cup
of coffee.

52:56.619 --> 52:58.721
Julie, good to see you again.

52:58.755 --> 53:00.388
It's Melanie.

53:00.422 --> 53:02.324
Then why does it say Julie at
2 pm?

53:03.525 --> 53:04.392
Oh, that's tomorrow.

53:04.426 --> 53:05.460
Okay, sorry.

53:05.494 --> 53:06.596
My mom is outside.

53:07.496 --> 53:08.330
Why?

53:08.363 --> 53:09.531
Why?

53:09.564 --> 53:12.034
Because the only person I
care about is losing her mind.

53:12.068 --> 53:13.870
Oh right, Melanie.

53:13.903 --> 53:15.470
What can I do for you?

53:15.504 --> 53:16.906
I told her my grades are
dropping,

53:16.939 --> 53:18.708
so you asked to see us both.

53:18.741 --> 53:20.475
Would you be able to do, like,

53:20.509 --> 53:21.878
I don't know, family therapy or
something

53:21.911 --> 53:23.813
and just try to work on her
delusions?

53:25.047 --> 53:25.915
Oh boy.

53:28.550 --> 53:29.752
Are you a licensed therapist?

53:29.786 --> 53:31.553
That's not required
of a school counselor.

53:31.587 --> 53:32.789
Do you have a PhD?

53:32.822 --> 53:35.057
I studied psychology at MGSU.

53:36.859 --> 53:38.628
Mississippi Gulf State
University.

53:40.763 --> 53:42.464
Well, I'm asking because
teenagers

53:42.497 --> 53:45.101
have serious psychological
issues.

53:45.134 --> 53:47.036
Melanie's had anxiety her entire
life.

53:47.069 --> 53:49.471
I've noticed.

53:49.504 --> 53:51.808
See, school counselors
can be just as perceptive

53:51.841 --> 53:53.042
as licensed therapists.

53:53.075 --> 53:54.844
Yeah, well, when her father
died,

53:54.877 --> 53:57.345
that aggravated her anxiety.

53:57.379 --> 53:59.514
He was a doctor, my husband.

53:59.548 --> 54:00.482
He had a PhD.

54:00.515 --> 54:02.517
Dawn, do you think there's
anything else

54:02.551 --> 54:05.955
frustrating Melanie besides
her general anxiety?

54:05.988 --> 54:08.724
Well, I'm sure it's
because of the stalker.

54:08.758 --> 54:09.926
She must have mentioned him to
you.

54:09.959 --> 54:12.527
Well, my conversations with
Melanie are confidential.

54:12.561 --> 54:14.563
But yes, she did, mm-hm.

54:14.597 --> 54:15.564
You know, let me tell you
something.

54:15.598 --> 54:18.366
The other night I was at a bar,

54:18.400 --> 54:22.872
and I got this severe pain in my
head.

54:22.905 --> 54:24.707
He's an electrical engineer.

54:24.740 --> 54:27.944
He built an electrical
device to cause me pain.

54:27.977 --> 54:30.580
Is is possible that the pain
was caused

54:30.613 --> 54:31.647
by something else?

54:32.682 --> 54:35.017
Perhaps drinking at a bar?

54:35.051 --> 54:37.587
Oh come on, give me a
break, Mississippi Gulf.

54:40.790 --> 54:43.993
Dawn, I just wanna read you
something,

54:44.026 --> 54:46.762
and I'm curious to get your
thoughts,

54:46.796 --> 54:47.997
if that's okay.

54:48.030 --> 54:48.898
Sure.

54:52.201 --> 54:54.871
"Delusions are false beliefs

54:54.904 --> 54:57.006
that are based on a
misinterpretation

54:57.039 --> 55:00.408
of perceptions or experiences.

55:00.442 --> 55:02.945
The unshakable belief
that one is followed,

55:02.979 --> 55:05.882
spied on or conspired against,

55:05.915 --> 55:07.449
is a characteristic

55:07.482 --> 55:10.953
of persecutory delusional
disorder."

55:16.592 --> 55:19.461
I think I got it, I think you
nailed it.

55:19.494 --> 55:20.162
Really?

55:21.764 --> 55:24.634
Yes. Brody, he has delusional
disorder.

55:27.103 --> 55:27.970
Hm.

55:46.521 --> 55:47.189
Much better.

55:49.058 --> 55:50.159
Let's get outta here.

56:04.539 --> 56:05.908
Hey, Maria.

56:05.942 --> 56:07.076
Maria, this is Melanie.

56:08.510 --> 56:09.812
Hi.

56:13.616 --> 56:14.549
Nice to meet you.

56:23.693 --> 56:26.862
They think they're so clever.

56:26.896 --> 56:29.464
Maybe they just don't want you
to drink?

56:31.100 --> 56:32.168
No, no.

56:32.201 --> 56:34.971
They don't want me drinking
any of their good shit.

56:35.004 --> 56:37.206
The cheap drinks are under the
bar.

56:40.109 --> 56:42.712
Might I interest you in a Bloody
Mary?

56:43.545 --> 56:44.213
Mm...

56:48.017 --> 56:49.118
Can you do a virgin?

56:50.286 --> 56:52.021
I would love to do a virgin.

56:52.054 --> 56:53.689
But let's drink first.

57:08.337 --> 57:09.205
Wanna jump in?

57:11.640 --> 57:13.976
I don't have my swim
suit.

57:14.010 --> 57:15.644
Well that's not enforced here.

57:18.214 --> 57:19.081
It's too cold.

57:20.182 --> 57:21.050
It's heated.

57:33.829 --> 57:34.997
You don't wanna jump in?

57:38.634 --> 57:40.636
I'm not a good swimmer.

57:40.669 --> 57:42.104
I know CPR.

57:42.138 --> 57:43.672
I know what you're doing.

57:43.706 --> 57:44.507
What am I doing?

57:44.539 --> 57:46.075
I'm just, I'm just trying to
swim.

57:46.108 --> 57:47.676
Can you stop coming on to me?

58:01.624 --> 58:02.557
It is freezing!

58:03.259 --> 58:04.660
You said it was heated.

58:04.693 --> 58:05.560
I lied.

58:10.833 --> 58:11.667
Ah!

58:27.650 --> 58:29.985
You know, I haven't gone
in a pool in two years.

58:35.724 --> 58:37.593
My dad died in our pool.

58:41.197 --> 58:42.264
He had a heart attack.

58:44.366 --> 58:45.234
I'm sorry.

58:47.670 --> 58:48.704
You know...

58:50.172 --> 58:52.141
The funny thing is is that he
always said

58:52.174 --> 58:54.243
that swimming is good for your
heart.

59:01.016 --> 59:01.917
I'm sorry.

59:03.085 --> 59:03.919
I don't know what-

59:03.953 --> 59:04.820
- No.

59:06.021 --> 59:07.256
I think it's just the drinks.

59:07.289 --> 59:08.190
You're okay.

59:11.727 --> 59:13.863
I thought I was over it.

59:17.266 --> 59:19.835
The first year was so
hard after I lost him.

59:28.177 --> 59:31.213
And now I'm afraid I'm losing my
mom.

59:34.049 --> 59:34.950
Is she sick?

59:46.128 --> 59:46.962
I'm sorry.

59:46.996 --> 59:49.231
I, I'm okay.

59:49.265 --> 59:50.099
What? No.

59:50.132 --> 59:51.066
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.135
I think, can we talk about
something else?

59:53.169 --> 59:55.237
Let's talk about something else.

59:55.271 --> 59:56.238
Okay.

59:56.272 --> 59:57.139
Okay.

1:00:01.443 --> 1:00:03.779
Would you go to prom with me?

1:00:30.372 --> 1:00:31.440
Hello ladies.

1:00:33.175 --> 1:00:34.009
I hope you didn't come

1:00:34.043 --> 1:00:36.045
in that big conspicuous van of
yours.

1:00:36.078 --> 1:00:37.446
Uh...

1:00:37.479 --> 1:00:40.482
So this is a full account of his
activity

1:00:40.516 --> 1:00:42.017
for the past week, okay?

1:00:42.051 --> 1:00:44.787
Leaves for work around 7:10.

1:00:44.820 --> 1:00:48.924
- Yep.
- Returns between 5:40 to six.

1:00:48.958 --> 1:00:51.827
On Saturday he went to
St. Percy's Hospital.

1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:52.828
Oh.

1:00:52.861 --> 1:00:55.297
You see? He's getting
psychiatric treatment.

1:00:55.331 --> 1:00:56.532
And on Sunday-

1:00:56.565 --> 1:00:57.900
- Yep.
- he went out to lunch

1:00:57.933 --> 1:00:59.235
with the wife and daughter.

1:00:59.268 --> 1:01:00.836
Here they are at Olive Garden.

1:01:00.869 --> 1:01:02.238
What did he order?

1:01:02.271 --> 1:01:03.038
Does it matter?

1:01:03.072 --> 1:01:04.273
Yeah, it looks like he's
holding

1:01:04.306 --> 1:01:05.507
some kind of probe here.

1:01:05.541 --> 1:01:06.976
It's a spoon.

1:01:07.009 --> 1:01:08.277
Oh, now you're an expert.

1:01:09.545 --> 1:01:11.113
Where's the audio?

1:01:11.146 --> 1:01:12.047
It's a photograph.

1:01:12.081 --> 1:01:13.148
You didn't get any audio?

1:01:13.182 --> 1:01:14.149
Did you want me to?

1:01:14.183 --> 1:01:16.885
Yes! It looks
like they're conspiring.

1:01:16.919 --> 1:01:18.354
No, I don't think so.

1:01:18.387 --> 1:01:19.888
She's probably saying something
like,

1:01:19.922 --> 1:01:21.390
pass the breadsticks.

1:01:21.423 --> 1:01:23.492
And he's like, I thought we
talked

1:01:23.525 --> 1:01:26.295
about you watching your
weight or something like that.

1:01:28.297 --> 1:01:30.332
Oh, okay.

1:01:30.366 --> 1:01:31.467
Yeah.

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:32.636
Well, so where's the footage
of him inside the house?

1:01:32.669 --> 1:01:35.104
'Cause that's where the
criminal activity is happening.

1:01:35.137 --> 1:01:37.473
It's illegal to film
him inside his house.

1:01:37.506 --> 1:01:39.108
Gary, you can't make an omelet

1:01:39.141 --> 1:01:40.542
without breaking a few eggs.

1:01:45.347 --> 1:01:49.285
Look, I've been in the
business for 25 years

1:01:49.318 --> 1:01:51.820
so if there was any suspicious
activity,

1:01:51.854 --> 1:01:54.223
I assure you I would catch it.

1:01:56.925 --> 1:01:59.261
You understand what this
means?

1:01:59.295 --> 1:02:00.162
Yeah...

1:02:01.196 --> 1:02:02.599
Do you?

1:02:02.632 --> 1:02:05.034
We're dealing with a seasoned
criminal

1:02:05.067 --> 1:02:06.568
who can outmaneuver a private
investigator

1:02:06.603 --> 1:02:08.404
with 25 years experience.

1:02:08.437 --> 1:02:11.240
Do you understand the mastermind
behind this operation?

1:02:37.667 --> 1:02:38.534
Mom!

1:02:41.270 --> 1:02:42.137
Mom!

1:02:43.472 --> 1:02:45.441
Mom, have you seen my laptop?

1:02:45.474 --> 1:02:47.142
Shh! He can hear you.

1:02:47.943 --> 1:02:50.446
You know why Gary couldn't find
anything?

1:02:50.479 --> 1:02:53.182
Because Brody's been tracking
us through your laptop.

1:02:54.416 --> 1:02:55.284
Where is it?

1:02:56.151 --> 1:02:57.419
I threw it away.

1:02:57.453 --> 1:02:58.520
What?

1:02:58.554 --> 1:02:59.355
Which garbage?

1:02:59.388 --> 1:03:01.090
The garbage they took this
morning.

1:03:01.123 --> 1:03:02.291
What the fuck, Mom?

1:03:02.324 --> 1:03:04.159
All of my notes, my projects, my
pictures,

1:03:04.193 --> 1:03:05.294
everything is on my computer!

1:03:05.327 --> 1:03:07.262
Well, you shouldn't have
everything on your laptop

1:03:07.296 --> 1:03:08.130
when it can be so easily hacked

1:03:08.163 --> 1:03:11.033
- by a predator.
- Oh! You're impossible!

1:03:11.066 --> 1:03:13.268
See, he's turning us against
each other!

1:03:22.111 --> 1:03:23.278
I taught you well.

1:03:23.312 --> 1:03:24.947
Well, I'm a good student.

1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:25.914
With any luck you'll graduate

1:03:25.948 --> 1:03:27.650
with a 4.0 blood alcohol level.

1:03:29.719 --> 1:03:31.220
- Who is that?
- Oh!

1:03:31.253 --> 1:03:32.388
- Hi!
- Hi, oh!

1:03:33.255 --> 1:03:34.356
- Eh eh eh!
- Edible?

1:03:34.390 --> 1:03:35.991
Oh, incredible.

1:03:36.024 --> 1:03:36.892
Yes.

1:03:38.728 --> 1:03:41.063
You will not believe who
I had to do to get this.

1:03:41.096 --> 1:03:42.164
Who?

1:03:42.197 --> 1:03:43.465
- Hey guys.
- Hey, what's up, man.

1:03:43.499 --> 1:03:44.667
Good to see you, dude.

1:03:44.701 --> 1:03:45.567
Not him.

1:03:46.603 --> 1:03:48.671
Oh, my...

1:03:48.705 --> 1:03:51.608
Oh hey, is this your first
time?

1:03:51.641 --> 1:03:52.941
So?

1:03:52.975 --> 1:03:54.076
I mean, you might wanna start

1:03:54.109 --> 1:03:55.277
with, like, a quarter of that,

1:03:55.310 --> 1:03:57.647
'cause a whole square is if
you really wanna check out.

1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:00.015
I really wanna check out.

1:04:05.554 --> 1:04:06.422
Mm.

1:04:16.165 --> 1:04:16.999
Woo!

1:04:28.277 --> 1:04:29.411
What was that?

1:04:31.180 --> 1:04:33.248
What was what?

1:04:37.787 --> 1:04:39.521
I'm gonna be sick.

1:06:12.882 --> 1:06:14.717
Leave me alone!

1:06:14.751 --> 1:06:16.151
For the millionth time,

1:06:16.184 --> 1:06:18.655
I didn't kiss her.

1:06:18.688 --> 1:06:19.689
Well, I saw you.

1:06:20.556 --> 1:06:21.624
You were high as a kite.

1:06:21.658 --> 1:06:24.126
You don't know what you saw.

1:06:24.159 --> 1:06:24.827
You're paranoid.

1:06:28.865 --> 1:06:31.199
Look, it's not your fault.

1:06:32.467 --> 1:06:34.269
It's just what weed sometimes
does.

1:06:44.581 --> 1:06:49.586
Okay.

1:06:51.453 --> 1:06:52.321
Sorry.

1:07:13.876 --> 1:07:14.744
Oh.

1:07:26.689 --> 1:07:28.290
I can't live here.

1:07:29.592 --> 1:07:31.861
I'm gonna go stay in my car from
now on.

1:07:34.731 --> 1:07:36.298
But you can't live in your
car.

1:07:36.331 --> 1:07:38.166
Let's just go to a hotel.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:41.236
I don't have money to
throw around on hotels.

1:07:41.269 --> 1:07:43.673
Anyways, he can access
the roof of a hotel.

1:07:43.706 --> 1:07:44.907
Yeah but Mom, you're going to
sleep

1:07:44.941 --> 1:07:46.441
in your car every night?

1:07:46.475 --> 1:07:49.244
No, that's crazy, Mom.

1:07:49.277 --> 1:07:50.412
We should just move.

1:07:50.445 --> 1:07:52.180
You think he won't follow us?

1:07:54.684 --> 1:07:57.620
Mom, please, please don't go,
Mom.

1:07:57.654 --> 1:08:00.222
If I go, at least you'll be
okay.

1:08:01.223 --> 1:08:01.991
- Okay.
- No, Mom please.

1:08:02.025 --> 1:08:03.059
- Mom, I need-
- Melanie, Melanie,

1:08:03.092 --> 1:08:06.261
I know, Melanie, I can't,
I just can't, Melanie.

1:08:06.294 --> 1:08:07.195
Please, Mom.

1:08:07.229 --> 1:08:08.965
Melanie, I can't.

1:08:08.998 --> 1:08:10.432
I'm sorry.

1:08:11.734 --> 1:08:14.804
Melanie, I can't do it. I can't
do it.

1:08:14.837 --> 1:08:15.705
I'm sorry.

1:11:05.174 --> 1:11:06.609
Hi.

1:11:06.642 --> 1:11:07.977
You look amazing.

1:11:08.845 --> 1:11:10.646
Like, so gorgeous.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:11.546
Thank you.

1:11:13.716 --> 1:11:14.584
You look good.

1:11:15.751 --> 1:11:16.586
Thanks.

1:11:16.619 --> 1:11:19.856
I haven't had anything to drink
today.

1:11:19.889 --> 1:11:22.091
So, I'm like 100% here with you.

1:11:23.793 --> 1:11:24.660
Okay.

1:11:26.028 --> 1:11:27.362
This is for you.

1:11:29.131 --> 1:11:32.702
And that's the fun-sized
version.

1:11:32.735 --> 1:11:34.604
This is also for you.

1:11:34.637 --> 1:11:35.503
Thank you.

1:11:37.907 --> 1:11:40.475
And the limo?

1:11:40.508 --> 1:11:42.477
Will be here in like an hour.

1:11:46.649 --> 1:11:48.885
So what do you wanna do for an
hour?

1:12:19.882 --> 1:12:21.150
It's a very pointy
dress.

1:12:21.183 --> 1:12:23.619
I know, well, it was my mom's

1:12:23.653 --> 1:12:24.854
and apparently handmade in Peru

1:12:24.887 --> 1:12:29.457
and the rhinestones were
attached with this...

1:12:32.028 --> 1:12:33.696
You're beautiful.

1:12:51.013 --> 1:12:55.084
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1:12:55.117 --> 1:12:55.985
Me too.

1:12:58.754 --> 1:13:03.759
I mean you to me.

1:13:15.938 --> 1:13:17.273
No. God.

1:13:17.306 --> 1:13:19.108
- She called the police again.
- What the hell?

1:13:19.141 --> 1:13:20.209
Fuck! Fuck!

1:13:22.244 --> 1:13:23.846
No!

1:13:23.879 --> 1:13:24.914
My daughter's in the house.

1:13:24.947 --> 1:13:26.615
I was coming home to take a
shower.

1:13:27.583 --> 1:13:29.517
Melanie, Melanie!

1:13:29.551 --> 1:13:32.021
Okay, Melanie, Melanie was in
the house.

1:13:32.054 --> 1:13:34.156
Melanie, tell the officer what
you saw.

1:13:34.190 --> 1:13:35.925
You saw him climbing on the
roof.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:38.594
I was inside.

1:13:38.627 --> 1:13:39.494
I didn't see.

1:13:39.527 --> 1:13:40.596
Okay, fine, you didn't see
this time

1:13:40.629 --> 1:13:42.765
but tell the officer how
many times you've seen Brody

1:13:42.798 --> 1:13:44.166
- on the roof.
- What did you see?

1:13:45.134 --> 1:13:46.969
Tell us what you saw.

1:13:47.003 --> 1:13:48.070
Tell, tell!

1:13:50.006 --> 1:13:51.173
I didn't see anything.

1:13:53.209 --> 1:13:54.944
Melanie, what are you saying?

1:13:54.977 --> 1:13:56.012
- Melanie, Melanie.
- Mom...

1:13:56.045 --> 1:13:56.511
- Tell the officer the truth!
- Listen to me, Mom.

1:13:56.544 --> 1:13:57.380
It's in your head.

1:13:57.413 --> 1:13:58.080
- It has always-
- It's not in my head,

1:13:58.114 --> 1:13:59.015
- Melanie.
- It has always been

1:13:59.048 --> 1:14:00.750
- in your head, Mom.
- What are you saying,

1:14:00.783 --> 1:14:02.151
- Melanie?
- You are paranoid, Mom.

1:14:02.184 --> 1:14:03.019
- Please listen to me.
- Melanie, what are you

1:14:03.052 --> 1:14:03.753
saying to me?

1:14:03.786 --> 1:14:04.754
- Melanie-
- Listen, listen to me.

1:14:04.787 --> 1:14:05.921
- You need help.
- Melanie, I don't understand

1:14:05.955 --> 1:14:08.724
- what you're saying to me.
- It's okay, it's okay, Mom.

1:14:08.758 --> 1:14:10.993
- We saw him together Melanie!
- You are paranoid, Mom.

1:14:11.027 --> 1:14:12.328
What are you saying to me now.

1:14:12.361 --> 1:14:13.295
What are you talking about?

1:14:13.329 --> 1:14:14.163
- We saw him together.
- You need help, Mom!

1:14:14.196 --> 1:14:16.065
- Let her go, let her go.
- He did!

1:14:16.098 --> 1:14:17.099
- What's going on?
- Mom!

1:14:17.133 --> 1:14:18.566
- What's going on?
- Just nothing!

1:14:18.601 --> 1:14:20.236
Mom, please see a psychiatrist
with me.

1:14:20.269 --> 1:14:21.437
Please just come see

1:14:21.470 --> 1:14:22.605
- a psychiatrist with me Mom.
- Melanie, I don't even know

1:14:22.638 --> 1:14:23.272
what you're saying.

1:14:23.305 --> 1:14:24.373
Mom, just to see

1:14:24.407 --> 1:14:25.941
- if medication will work, Mom.
- No, no, you, you,

1:14:25.975 --> 1:14:27.243
- you are a traitor!
- Let me help you!

1:14:27.276 --> 1:14:28.711
- No, Mom!
- You are a traitor!

1:14:28.744 --> 1:14:30.212
- Get away from me!
- Listen to me.

1:14:30.246 --> 1:14:31.080
- Melanie, forget about her.
- I cannot believe

1:14:31.113 --> 1:14:31.647
- she's doing this to me.
- She's sick.

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:32.314
Don't listen to anything

1:14:32.348 --> 1:14:33.349
- she's saying.
- Shut up!

1:14:33.382 --> 1:14:34.917
- It's all right.
- You told me she was sick.

1:14:34.950 --> 1:14:35.785
No!

1:14:35.818 --> 1:14:36.786
Don't call her sick!

1:14:36.819 --> 1:14:37.686
What's your problem?

1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:38.721
Just leave!

1:14:38.754 --> 1:14:40.289
Why are you still here?

1:14:40.322 --> 1:14:41.090
You already got what you wanted!

1:14:41.123 --> 1:14:42.158
- Just go!
- I'm trying to help you!

1:14:42.191 --> 1:14:43.225
Leave me alone!

1:14:43.259 --> 1:14:44.393
Melanie, what
are you saying to me now?

1:14:44.427 --> 1:14:46.262
Listen to me,
everything was in your head-

1:14:46.295 --> 1:14:47.229
- I don't know you.

1:14:47.263 --> 1:14:48.864
- You do not deserve my dress.
- Please, Mom.

1:14:48.898 --> 1:14:49.564
- Take my dress off.
- Mom!

1:14:49.598 --> 1:14:50.232
- Take my dress off!
- Mom!

1:14:50.266 --> 1:14:50.933
Because you are a traitor!

1:14:50.966 --> 1:14:53.135
Listen to me, Mom!

1:14:53.169 --> 1:14:54.837
- Get back in the car.
- It's not in my head!

1:14:54.870 --> 1:14:56.072
- Get back in the car!
- It's not in my head.

1:14:56.105 --> 1:14:56.939
Melanie...

1:14:56.972 --> 1:14:57.973
I don't even know you right
know.

1:14:58.007 --> 1:14:59.942
- Melanie, come over here.
- Back away from me!

1:14:59.975 --> 1:15:00.810
It's okay-

1:15:00.843 --> 1:15:01.510
Mom, it's okay!

1:15:01.544 --> 1:15:02.378
Get her away from me!

1:15:02.411 --> 1:15:03.446
- Come over here.
- She's telling me

1:15:03.479 --> 1:15:06.649
- that I'm not seeing things.
- Mom, please, Mom!

1:15:06.682 --> 1:15:08.184
She saw him too!

1:15:08.217 --> 1:15:10.186
Do you believe that
your mother is a threat

1:15:10.219 --> 1:15:11.720
- to herself or to others?
- That man has been stalking

1:15:11.754 --> 1:15:14.990
- me for how many months now?
- If she is,

1:15:15.024 --> 1:15:17.326
you can get her
hospitalized involuntarily,

1:15:17.359 --> 1:15:18.627
but they will not keep
her against her will

1:15:18.661 --> 1:15:21.063
more than 72 hours, okay?

1:15:21.097 --> 1:15:22.264
You don't see
anybody because you gotta go

1:15:22.298 --> 1:15:23.833
around the house.
Focus on me,

1:15:23.866 --> 1:15:24.700
It's gonna be...

1:15:24.733 --> 1:15:25.568
Focus on me.

1:15:25.601 --> 1:15:26.802
- Mom!
- Was is she saying right now?

1:15:26.836 --> 1:15:27.736
Listen to me.

1:15:27.770 --> 1:15:28.671
- You better say-
- Please listen to me.

1:15:28.704 --> 1:15:29.805
that I know what the hell's
going on!

1:15:29.839 --> 1:15:31.006
Melanie.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:32.308
- Listen to me, listen to me.
- Please mom, I'm sorry Mom.

1:15:32.341 --> 1:15:33.342
Don't say you're sorry to me.

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:34.276
- Back the fuck away!
- Just let me talk to her.

1:15:34.310 --> 1:15:35.211
- Let me talk to her.
- I promise I will.

1:15:35.244 --> 1:15:36.145
- Let me talk to her.
- Just relax, relax.

1:15:36.178 --> 1:15:38.147
I can't even think straight
right now.

1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:39.882
Why are you in my face right
now?

1:15:39.915 --> 1:15:40.584
You back off!

1:15:40.616 --> 1:15:42.084
Let me talk to her, please!

1:15:42.118 --> 1:15:42.985
Mom, please!

1:15:43.018 --> 1:15:43.819
- Mom!
- Relax.

1:15:43.853 --> 1:15:45.087
- Let her go.
- Everybody's looking,

1:15:45.121 --> 1:15:45.955
- and this is-
- Let her go.

1:15:45.988 --> 1:15:46.789
- just fucking crazy!
- Let her go.

1:15:46.822 --> 1:15:47.623
Please, why can't
you

1:15:47.656 --> 1:15:48.390
- let me talk to her?
- Let her go.

1:15:48.424 --> 1:15:49.058
- Let her go.
- Please, please.

1:15:49.091 --> 1:15:51.093
- One last thing.
- Mom!

1:15:51.127 --> 1:15:52.394
- One last thing.
- Listen!

1:15:52.428 --> 1:15:53.829
Let her hear this.

1:15:53.863 --> 1:15:56.732
Dad would be disgusted in you.

1:16:03.706 --> 1:16:04.373
Mom.

1:16:08.477 --> 1:16:09.845
Mom!

1:16:09.879 --> 1:16:10.913
You're not my daughter.

1:16:10.946 --> 1:16:11.947
Don't leave, Mom.

1:16:11.981 --> 1:16:13.149
Not my daughter.

1:16:17.052 --> 1:16:18.454
Mom!

1:16:18.487 --> 1:16:19.822
Just let me go!

1:18:20.309 --> 1:18:22.344
I needed one person to rely on.

1:18:26.382 --> 1:18:27.249
I know.

1:18:35.057 --> 1:18:36.525
You need help.

1:18:40.029 --> 1:18:41.163
I can't fix you.

1:18:47.336 --> 1:18:48.871
I can't fix anyone.

1:19:19.669 --> 1:19:21.570
Hi,
this is Officer Morales.

1:19:21.604 --> 1:19:24.440
Hi, this is Melanie.

1:19:24.473 --> 1:19:25.908
Dawn Leedy's daughter.

1:19:26.676 --> 1:19:28.143
How can I
help you?

1:19:29.078 --> 1:19:31.914
I haven't heard from my mom in
two weeks

1:19:31.947 --> 1:19:33.916
and her phone is disconnected.

1:19:34.718 --> 1:19:36.051
Are you a
minor?

1:19:36.085 --> 1:19:37.620
You can't be staying on your
own.

1:19:39.054 --> 1:19:39.988
I'm with my dad.

1:19:40.856 --> 1:19:42.057
Tell him to
come,

1:19:42.091 --> 1:19:43.959
and file a missing persons
report.

1:19:43.992 --> 1:19:46.295
I also recommend he call
hospitals,

1:19:46.328 --> 1:19:49.064
and if he can't find her...

1:19:49.098 --> 1:19:50.600
the morgue.

1:20:02.712 --> 1:20:03.579
Thank you.

1:20:06.281 --> 1:20:08.083
I didn't have anyone else to
ask.

1:20:08.117 --> 1:20:09.218
That's okay.

1:20:16.058 --> 1:20:18.227
How did you track her down?

1:20:18.260 --> 1:20:19.629
The GPS of her car.

1:20:27.102 --> 1:20:28.671
It looks like she's right up
here.

1:20:46.355 --> 1:20:48.625
Well, we can walk around the
neighborhood,

1:20:48.658 --> 1:20:50.959
go door to door, ask if anyone's
seen her.

1:21:37.206 --> 1:21:38.073
Mom.

1:21:40.610 --> 1:21:41.443
Here you go, Charles.

1:21:41.477 --> 1:21:43.278
Thank you.

1:21:43.312 --> 1:21:46.181
What are you doing here?

1:21:46.215 --> 1:21:47.049
What?

1:21:47.082 --> 1:21:47.884
Mom, what happened
to you?

1:21:47.917 --> 1:21:49.351
You're going the wrong
way.

1:21:49.384 --> 1:21:51.019
What are you...

1:21:51.053 --> 1:21:54.389
Oh, now you're paying
him to spy on me, huh?

1:21:56.693 --> 1:21:58.628
You're living on the street?

1:21:58.661 --> 1:22:00.529
You think I wanna be here?

1:22:00.562 --> 1:22:02.231
I'm here because you stabbed me

1:22:02.264 --> 1:22:05.100
in the back with the
police, that's why I'm here.

1:22:05.133 --> 1:22:06.134
Please come home, Mom.

1:22:06.168 --> 1:22:07.704
I can't. I can't.

1:22:07.737 --> 1:22:09.137
Because of you I can't.

1:22:09.171 --> 1:22:10.038
I'm sorry.

1:22:12.809 --> 1:22:14.409
I'm so sorry for everything.

1:22:14.443 --> 1:22:15.310
I just...

1:22:18.848 --> 1:22:19.682
You can't stay here.

1:22:19.716 --> 1:22:22.150
I can't even stay in my car
anymore.

1:22:22.184 --> 1:22:23.452
He's tracking it.

1:22:23.485 --> 1:22:25.220
This is the first place
I found that's safe.

1:22:25.254 --> 1:22:26.088
I am not leaving it.

1:22:40.837 --> 1:22:42.271
I brought you some food.

1:22:43.138 --> 1:22:43.773
It's in the car, I can get it
for you.

1:22:43.806 --> 1:22:46.174
I don't need your favors.

1:22:46.208 --> 1:22:47.744
I can get my meals at the
shelter.

1:22:49.244 --> 1:22:53.048
Well, I got you some sweaters.

1:22:54.751 --> 1:22:55.818
And a dress.

1:22:55.852 --> 1:22:57.820
What am I gonna do with a
dress?

1:22:57.854 --> 1:22:59.589
It's my graduation Friday.

1:23:03.492 --> 1:23:04.560
Give me a break.

1:23:04.594 --> 1:23:06.194
You don't want me there.

1:23:06.228 --> 1:23:07.362
You just don't wanna be
embarrassed

1:23:07.396 --> 1:23:09.298
when your friends wondered
why your mom didn't show up.

1:23:09.331 --> 1:23:10.833
I don't even care about
graduation.

1:23:10.867 --> 1:23:11.668
I promise you.

1:23:11.701 --> 1:23:13.603
I'll stay here with
you.

1:23:13.636 --> 1:23:15.571
Listen to me, don't you get
it that he's following you?

1:23:15.605 --> 1:23:17.573
The longer you stay here the
more dangerous it is for me.

1:23:17.607 --> 1:23:19.308
I can't leave you here alone.

1:23:19.341 --> 1:23:21.476
Melanie, you're hurting me,
okay?

1:23:23.746 --> 1:23:24.614
Go.

1:23:28.618 --> 1:23:29.484
Go!

1:23:42.699 --> 1:23:44.466
My dad was an alcoholic.

1:23:46.769 --> 1:23:49.204
I spent half my childhood
trying to save him,

1:23:49.237 --> 1:23:50.673
the other half hiding from him.

1:23:52.574 --> 1:23:54.576
Sometimes you can't save a
drowning man.

1:23:56.913 --> 1:23:58.681
You either sink with them or
swim.

1:24:02.184 --> 1:24:03.820
When I was 18, I cut him loose.

1:25:13.990 --> 1:25:15.858
Congratulations.

1:25:15.892 --> 1:25:17.960
Well done, little lady.

1:25:17.994 --> 1:25:19.461
Congratulations.

1:25:21.530 --> 1:25:23.866
My salutatorian.
Congratulations.

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:24.834
Thank you.

1:25:24.867 --> 1:25:26.435
Your mom must be so proud.

1:25:32.675 --> 1:25:33.575
Congrats.

1:25:35.745 --> 1:25:36.646
Thanks.

1:25:37.512 --> 1:25:39.782
You can't hate me as
much as I hate myself.

1:25:39.816 --> 1:25:40.983
You'd be surprised.

1:25:44.620 --> 1:25:46.789
What are we even supposed
to do with these things?

1:25:46.823 --> 1:25:47.890
Hang yourself.

1:25:51.728 --> 1:25:53.528
I don't know what's wrong with
me.

1:25:54.931 --> 1:25:57.900
I mean you, you were my
only friend for 11 years.

1:26:00.737 --> 1:26:01.637
I'm so sorry.

1:26:02.739 --> 1:26:03.606
I'm trash.

1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:05.507
I know I am.

1:26:08.077 --> 1:26:08.945
I hate you.

1:26:09.979 --> 1:26:10.847
Yeah, I know.

1:26:12.782 --> 1:26:14.349
And I'll keep hating you.

1:26:15.952 --> 1:26:17.452
For the rest of high school.

1:26:23.726 --> 1:26:25.393
I was so drunk I
tripped on my prom dress

1:26:25.427 --> 1:26:26.729
and it slipped off.

1:26:28.598 --> 1:26:31.500
If it's any consolation, the
whole class saw me naked.

1:26:31.533 --> 1:26:32.668
I bet you loved it.

1:26:34.737 --> 1:26:35.938
I'll see you out there.

1:27:12.541 --> 1:27:14.543
I'm so happy you came.

1:27:16.913 --> 1:27:18.480
How are you?

1:27:18.513 --> 1:27:19.381
Hm.

1:27:20.149 --> 1:27:21.684
You wanna have lunch after?

1:27:22.752 --> 1:27:23.953
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:27:25.855 --> 1:27:29.491
This class by far has been
the most successful class

1:27:29.524 --> 1:27:31.961
in the history of our school.

1:27:31.994 --> 1:27:33.663
I say that to every class.

1:27:36.132 --> 1:27:37.900
But in all seriousness,

1:27:37.934 --> 1:27:40.803
I'm honored to say that
I've learned so much

1:27:40.837 --> 1:27:43.405
from each and every one of you.

1:27:43.438 --> 1:27:46.108
I've learned about patience,
motivation,

1:27:46.142 --> 1:27:48.945
determination, and at prom,

1:27:48.978 --> 1:27:49.979
I learned about twerking.

1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:52.414
Thank you, Vanessa.

1:27:56.686 --> 1:27:58.486
But most of all,

1:27:58.520 --> 1:27:59.288
I learned that in order

1:27:59.322 --> 1:28:00.790
- for our students to excel.
- Hey!

1:28:00.823 --> 1:28:02.557
Everybody sees you, Brody!

1:28:03.593 --> 1:28:05.127
Brody, I have witnesses now!

1:28:05.161 --> 1:28:07.630
- Brody!
- Please be seated.

1:28:07.663 --> 1:28:09.431
- Brody, I see you!
- Mom!

1:28:09.464 --> 1:28:10.166
- What are you doing?
- Okay, I see you!

1:28:10.199 --> 1:28:11.701
- I see you!
- Stop it.

1:28:11.734 --> 1:28:12.602
- You are humiliating me.
- What?

1:28:12.635 --> 1:28:14.136
Oh now you know what it's
like, huh?

1:28:14.170 --> 1:28:15.071
Why are you ruining
everything?

1:28:15.104 --> 1:28:16.839
Why did you even ask me to
come here?

1:28:16.873 --> 1:28:17.874
Mom-
Why?

1:28:17.907 --> 1:28:19.775
- Because he followed me here!
- Mom, just relax!

1:28:19.809 --> 1:28:20.843
- No!
- Sit down.

1:28:20.877 --> 1:28:21.576
- Sit down!
- No!

1:28:21.611 --> 1:28:22.577
- Just leave then!
- No, no.

1:28:22.612 --> 1:28:23.411
- No, I won't!
- Leave!

1:28:23.445 --> 1:28:24.814
I don't need you in my life
anymore.

1:28:24.847 --> 1:28:25.615
- Oh really?
- Yes.

1:28:25.648 --> 1:28:26.448
Well fuck you and your
ceremony!

1:28:26.481 --> 1:28:27.850
I don't wanna see you again,
Mom.

1:28:27.884 --> 1:28:28.684
All right, fine.

1:28:28.718 --> 1:28:29.785
Then you never will!

1:28:29.819 --> 1:28:30.720
How's that?

1:28:30.753 --> 1:28:32.121
It should have been you
instead of Dad.

1:28:32.154 --> 1:28:33.756
What did you just say?

1:28:33.789 --> 1:28:35.858
It should have been
you.

1:28:37.459 --> 1:28:38.294
Ma'am, not here.

1:28:38.327 --> 1:28:40.562
Follow us.
come on.

1:28:40.596 --> 1:28:42.464
- Calm down please.
- Yes.

1:28:42.497 --> 1:28:43.733

Melanie Leedy.

1:31:42.845 --> 1:31:45.915
Any chance you're
related to Charles Leedy?

1:31:45.948 --> 1:31:47.383
Yeah, my dad.

1:31:47.416 --> 1:31:50.386
We were classmates.

1:31:50.419 --> 1:31:51.821
We took this class together

1:31:51.854 --> 1:31:53.889
some 30 years ago.

1:31:54.890 --> 1:31:55.891
How the heck is he?

1:31:58.961 --> 1:32:00.830
Here's a classic for you.

1:32:00.863 --> 1:32:03.866
So first year students are
about to dissect cadavers

1:32:03.899 --> 1:32:04.700
in the morgue.

1:32:04.733 --> 1:32:05.935
And your dad was in his last
year,

1:32:05.968 --> 1:32:08.137
so nobody knew who he was.

1:32:08.170 --> 1:32:10.072
He gets there early, undresses,

1:32:10.106 --> 1:32:12.374
and he pretends to be a corpse.

1:32:12.408 --> 1:32:14.910
I swear he lied still for 20
minutes.

1:32:14.944 --> 1:32:16.745
A determined son of a...

1:32:16.779 --> 1:32:19.381
At some point I'm worrying
he's actually dead.

1:32:19.415 --> 1:32:21.383
Well, Professor Flynn takes out
a scalpel,

1:32:21.417 --> 1:32:22.485
ready to cut into his flesh,

1:32:22.518 --> 1:32:25.754
and suddenly your dad jumps
up and starts screaming,

1:32:25.788 --> 1:32:27.790
"It's a miracle! It's a
miracle!"

1:32:29.158 --> 1:32:32.328
Professor Flynn passes out.

1:32:32.361 --> 1:32:34.396
Three students run out
screaming.

1:32:34.430 --> 1:32:37.867
And I don't think we ever saw
them again.

1:32:37.900 --> 1:32:39.702
Oh my god.

1:32:39.735 --> 1:32:41.937
Do you have any more stories?

1:32:41.971 --> 1:32:42.905
Hundreds.

1:32:43.839 --> 1:32:45.441
How much time you got?

1:33:04.326 --> 1:33:05.928
Hi, it's me.

1:33:05.961 --> 1:33:08.797
I wanted to let you know
I'm selling the house.

1:33:08.831 --> 1:33:10.399
Neither of us live there
anymore, so...

1:33:10.432 --> 1:33:12.768
I'm putting things in storage.

1:33:14.303 --> 1:33:16.338
If you're coming back for a
break,

1:33:16.372 --> 1:33:17.940
you can sort through your things

1:33:17.973 --> 1:33:20.276
and decide what to do with them.

1:33:20.309 --> 1:33:21.944
Okay...

1:33:21.977 --> 1:33:22.845
Bye.

1:34:16.865 --> 1:34:18.167
Hi.

1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:20.836
I left empty boxes in
your room.

1:34:20.869 --> 1:34:21.705
You can take what you want

1:34:21.770 --> 1:34:23.739
or throw it all away, I don't
care.

1:35:19.561 --> 1:35:21.930
Come on, come on.

1:35:21.964 --> 1:35:22.898
Oh come on.

1:35:33.409 --> 1:35:36.178
I'm sorry for what I said at
graduation.

1:35:39.214 --> 1:35:41.116
Oh, give me a break.

1:35:42.985 --> 1:35:46.555
You, you never once believed me.

1:35:46.589 --> 1:35:48.991
You never once took my side.

1:35:49.024 --> 1:35:50.859
Mom, I was always on your
side.

1:35:50.893 --> 1:35:51.927
Are you kidding me?

1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:54.863
You have no idea how much
pain he's causing me.

1:35:54.897 --> 1:35:57.099
Do you know last night I burned
up so bad

1:35:57.132 --> 1:35:58.300
I wanted to die?

1:35:58.334 --> 1:35:59.068
Mom, I don't know

1:35:59.101 --> 1:36:00.135
what to say.

1:36:00.169 --> 1:36:01.036
I do.

1:36:02.004 --> 1:36:03.572
You abandoned me.

1:36:03.606 --> 1:36:04.473
That's what it is.

1:36:04.506 --> 1:36:05.874
You abandoned me.

1:36:06.643 --> 1:36:07.476
I'm sorry.

1:36:07.509 --> 1:36:08.377
No you're not.

1:36:09.445 --> 1:36:10.312
No you're not.

1:36:16.251 --> 1:36:17.353
Look what he did to us!

1:36:17.386 --> 1:36:19.254
My own daughter he turned
against me!

1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:31.433
Where's your dad?

1:36:31.467 --> 1:36:32.602
Where's your dad, huh?

1:36:32.635 --> 1:36:33.435
Come on, come on.

1:36:33.469 --> 1:36:34.136
- Get inside.
- Where's your husband?

1:36:34.169 --> 1:36:36.138
He's taken everything from me!

1:36:36.171 --> 1:36:37.005
Where is he?

1:36:37.039 --> 1:36:37.741
He has never done

1:36:37.774 --> 1:36:39.208
- anything to you.
- Yes he has!

1:36:39.241 --> 1:36:41.009
I've had enough!

1:36:41.043 --> 1:36:42.010
That's it.

1:36:42.044 --> 1:36:43.946
That's the machine he's
been using against me.

1:36:43.979 --> 1:36:45.114
That's it, right there.

1:36:46.014 --> 1:36:46.949
Brody!

1:36:46.982 --> 1:36:47.650
Brody!

1:36:49.719 --> 1:36:51.086
He passed away.

1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:52.988
What are you talking about,
bullshit!

1:36:53.021 --> 1:36:54.089
We lost him a month ago.

1:36:54.123 --> 1:36:55.023
No you didn't.

1:36:55.057 --> 1:36:57.559
No, because last night I was
burning up,

1:36:57.594 --> 1:37:00.162
I was burning from that
machine right there!

1:37:02.297 --> 1:37:05.100
That's his chemotherapy
machine.

1:37:05.134 --> 1:37:06.535
He had pancreatic cancer.

1:37:11.206 --> 1:37:12.074
What?

1:37:14.543 --> 1:37:16.713
Doesn't make sense.

1:37:16.746 --> 1:37:17.579
It doesn't make sense.

1:37:17.614 --> 1:37:19.281
Mom, it's okay.

1:37:19.314 --> 1:37:20.650
It doesn't make sense.

1:37:22.317 --> 1:37:24.587
- It's okay.
- I'm not doing well here.

1:37:24.621 --> 1:37:25.521
I'm not doing well.

1:37:25.554 --> 1:37:27.256
- I can't, I can't breathe.
- Mom, just...

1:37:27.289 --> 1:37:29.425
- I'm not doing...
- Mom, look at me.

1:37:29.458 --> 1:37:30.492
I can't do it.

1:37:30.526 --> 1:37:31.193
It's okay, it's okay.

1:37:31.226 --> 1:37:32.629
I don't know what's happening.

1:37:32.662 --> 1:37:33.562
- Mom, look at me.
- I don't know...

1:37:33.596 --> 1:37:35.632
You're okay, it's okay.

1:37:35.665 --> 1:37:36.699
- I don't feel good.
- I'm here.

1:37:36.733 --> 1:37:38.033
- I know.
- I can't breathe.

1:37:38.066 --> 1:37:39.368
Come on, just put your arm
over.

1:37:39.401 --> 1:37:40.068
- I think I gotta go.
- Come on, come on.

1:37:40.102 --> 1:37:42.471
I gotta go to the hospital.

1:37:42.504 --> 1:37:45.441
I gotta go.

1:38:29.251 --> 1:38:30.118
Thanks.

1:38:31.153 --> 1:38:32.488
How is she?

1:38:32.521 --> 1:38:34.189
Sleeping.

1:38:34.223 --> 1:38:35.692
You can see her during visiting
hours.

1:38:35.725 --> 1:38:38.260
Well, how long will she need
to stay?

1:38:38.293 --> 1:38:39.461
Probably a few weeks.

1:38:39.495 --> 1:38:42.064
We'll need to see how she
progresses.

1:38:42.097 --> 1:38:43.265
But she'll get better?

1:38:44.199 --> 1:38:45.567
Pills and therapy help,

1:38:45.602 --> 1:38:47.770
and she'll need to stick
with both of those.

1:38:49.338 --> 1:38:52.474
But there's no cure for
delusional disorder.

1:38:52.508 --> 1:38:54.409
There's only treatment.

1:38:54.443 --> 1:38:56.411
We see the best results in
patients

1:38:56.445 --> 1:38:59.481
who have a strong system of
support.

1:38:59.515 --> 1:39:00.549
Hm.

1:39:00.583 --> 1:39:02.417
Well, I'm the only one she has.

1:39:03.786 --> 1:39:05.120
And I'm not that strong.

1:39:06.355 --> 1:39:08.591
I talked with your mom
for almost two hours.

1:39:09.692 --> 1:39:11.560
Sounds like you've been through
a lot.

1:39:12.762 --> 1:39:13.796
I gave up on her.

1:39:15.632 --> 1:39:17.399
It's easy to blame people who
are ill

1:39:17.432 --> 1:39:19.101
for the way they are.

1:39:19.134 --> 1:39:21.336
But she didn't choose mental
illness

1:39:21.370 --> 1:39:25.374
any more than a person
chooses cancer or diabetes.

1:39:27.309 --> 1:39:29.646
The way she described
you, you're pretty strong.

1:39:31.246 --> 1:39:33.583
You'll need to be strong
enough for both of you.

1:40:13.790 --> 1:40:14.657
Thanks.

1:40:15.858 --> 1:40:16.793
Appetizers.

1:40:24.801 --> 1:40:27.569
You know why there are no knives
in here?

1:40:27.604 --> 1:40:29.072
I can take a wild guess.

1:40:29.806 --> 1:40:32.675
Bonnie over there
tried to

1:40:32.709 --> 1:40:33.776
with a colored pencil.

1:40:34.443 --> 1:40:36.445
I mean, if you want it that
bad...

1:40:37.914 --> 1:40:38.915
Hi Bonnie.

1:40:38.948 --> 1:40:40.349
Mom, you're so obvious.

1:40:44.419 --> 1:40:45.822
My hair's thinning.

1:40:45.855 --> 1:40:48.323
A side effect of the medication.

1:40:48.357 --> 1:40:49.558
Oh, Mom.

1:40:49.592 --> 1:40:52.394
It's nothing terrible,
it's just thinning.

1:40:52.427 --> 1:40:53.730
Worst case scenario I'll cut it
short.

1:40:53.763 --> 1:40:55.598
I'll look like Grandpa.

1:40:55.632 --> 1:40:57.199
Well, I'll cut my hair too.

1:40:58.367 --> 1:41:00.168
We can do it together.

1:41:24.459 --> 1:41:27.295
I'm going back to USC on Friday.

1:41:27.329 --> 1:41:28.631
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1:41:29.899 --> 1:41:31.934
I'm sorry you had to miss so
much school.

1:41:33.670 --> 1:41:35.638
I'm coming back home next
week.

1:41:37.607 --> 1:41:39.842
Why would you do that?

1:41:39.876 --> 1:41:41.778
I'm moving back home.

1:41:41.811 --> 1:41:43.211
I can't let you do that.

1:41:43.245 --> 1:41:44.847
I'll transfer to a local
college.

1:41:44.881 --> 1:41:47.416
Don't give up on USC because
of me.

1:41:47.449 --> 1:41:49.518
I'm not doing it for you.

1:41:49.551 --> 1:41:50.552
I'm doing it for me.

1:41:58.427 --> 1:42:00.630
McCarthy
Quad serves as the hub

1:42:00.663 --> 1:42:02.832
of USC life especially

1:42:02.865 --> 1:42:04.934
for first year students.

1:42:04.967 --> 1:42:08.270
We have a great balance of
academic...
