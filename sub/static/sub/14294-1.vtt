00:08.160 --> 00:11.160
<i>Wednesday, April 16th 1746.</i>

00:11.800 --> 00:13.600
<i>This is the advance battalion</i>

00:13.720 --> 00:16.760
<i>of an English Government army
of 9,000 men.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.360
<i>Their objective: Culloden Moor,</i>

00:22.520 --> 00:26.080
<i>four and a half miles southeast
of the Highland town of Inverness.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:31.080
<i>Their purpose: the destruction of the
Highland Jacobite army of rebellion,</i>

00:31.680 --> 00:35.160
<i>a tired, ill-administered force
of less than 5,000 men</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:38.120
<i>who wait just beyond
the top of this ridge.</i>

00:38.840 --> 00:41.640
<i>Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Jacobite military secretary.</i>

00:41.880 --> 00:45.000
<i>Suffering advanced debility
and loss of memory.</i>

00:45.240 --> 00:48.440
<i>Former military engagement
56 years ago.</i>

00:48.880 --> 00:51.560
<i>Sir John MacDonald,
Jacobite captain of cavalry.</i>

00:51.920 --> 00:54.160
<i>Aged, frequently intoxicated,</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:57.800
<i>"described as " a man
of the most limited capacities.“</i>

00:58.200 --> 01:01.680
<i>John William O'Sullivan,
Jacobite quartermaster general.</i>

01:01.760 --> 01:04.760
<i>"Described as " an Irishman
whose vanity is superseded</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:07.080
<i>only by his lack of wisdom."</i>

01:07.480 --> 01:11.200
<i>Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
Jacobite commander in chief.</i>

01:11.800 --> 01:17.080
<i>Former military experience:
10 days at a siege at the age of 13.</i>

01:17.560 --> 01:21.080
You must understand, without
putting too fine a point on it,

01:21.240 --> 01:23.920
that the army here is
in a total shambles.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.200
I've got half my company missing.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.240
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.120
<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

01:31.240 --> 01:35.680
<i>why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:37.880
<i>handling the administration
of your army?</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Because I chose them.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.040
I consider those gentlemen to be
utterly trustworthy and competent.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.960
The first thing my men will find
when they do awake

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
is the enemy on them,
cutting their throats.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.920
<i>James MacDonald, taxman.</i>

02:55.480 --> 02:58.400
<i>Senior officer
in a ruthless clan system,</i>

02:58.520 --> 03:00.720
<i>who's brought with him
on to the moor</i>

03:00.840 --> 03:03.120
<i>men whose land he controls.</i>

03:03.480 --> 03:06.520
<i>Alistair McVurrich,
subtenant of a taxman.</i>

03:06.720 --> 03:10.760
<i>Owns one eighth of an acre
of soggy ground and two cows.</i>

03:11.080 --> 03:13.960
<i>Alan MacColl,
subtenant of a subtenant.</i>

03:14.200 --> 03:18.800
<i>Owns half-share in a small
potato patch measuring 30 feet.</i>

03:19.920 --> 03:22.520
<i>Angus MacDonald,
servant of a subtenant.</i>

03:22.640 --> 03:24.560
<i>He owns nothing.</i>

03:24.800 --> 03:28.120
<i>Lowest in the clan structure,
he is called a “cotter.“</i>

03:28.240 --> 03:31.720
<i>This man is totally dependent on
the men above him in the clan system.</i>

03:31.880 --> 03:34.080
<i>They, in their tum, on the taxman.</i>

03:34.440 --> 03:37.120
<i>They, in their tum, on this one man,</i>

03:37.240 --> 03:39.800
<i>the man who has brought them all
onto the moor.</i>

03:39.960 --> 03:43.800
<i>Alexander MacDonald,
called, in Gaelic, MacDhomhnuill,</i>

03:43.960 --> 03:46.040
<i>chief of the MacDonald's of Keppoch.</i>

03:46.680 --> 03:48.880
<i>The owner of all his tenants' land,</i>

03:49.040 --> 03:52.840
<i>the rem he has charged them
is to fight with him as clan warriors</i>

03:53.000 --> 03:54.520
<i>whenever he decrees.</i>

03:54.760 --> 03:58.680
<i>This is the system
of the Highland clan: human rent.</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:03.200
I hold my land from MacCruachan,
as my father did,

04:03.480 --> 04:07.360
by bringing him 20 fighting men
from amongst my tenants.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.680
These I have brought.

04:10.120 --> 04:14.720
<i>To this man, who is rent,
today's battle is a matter of honour.</i>

04:30.880 --> 04:33.360
I fight today because it is an honour

04:33.560 --> 04:36.320
to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill,

04:36.440 --> 04:39.600
and because my father
fought beside his father.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.400
<i>To this man, who is rem,
the battle is a matter of revenge.</i>

04:55.000 --> 04:59.480
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill,
then for Charlie.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.520
Then because the Campbells,
who did steal my cows,

05:02.640 --> 05:04.200
are with the enemy.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.240
I have also raised
over 100 men from Rannoch.

05:08.440 --> 05:12.400
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.720
<i>Alistair McVurrich, told by
his taxman that if he did not fight</i>

05:16.880 --> 05:19.960
<i>he would have his cattle taken
and his roof burnt.</i>

05:20.680 --> 05:23.040
<i>This is the system of the clan,</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:29.560
<i>a system that has brought
on to the moor over 4,000 men,</i>

05:29.680 --> 05:33.320
<i>men from Argyll and Inverness,
from Moidart, Appin and the isles,</i>

05:33.440 --> 05:36.320
<i>Catholics, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians,</i>

05:36.400 --> 05:39.240
<i>the MacDonalds, the MacLeans,
the Chisholms, the Camerons,</i>

05:39.360 --> 05:43.560
<i>the Farquharsons, the Frasers,
men of 14 major Highland clans.</i>

05:47.880 --> 05:51.520
<i>Men like this.
Donald Cameron of Loch Eil,</i>

05:51.640 --> 05:54.280
<i>chief of the powerful clan Cameron,</i>

05:54.440 --> 05:57.280
<i>fearing for the survival of
the ancient and ruthless society</i>

05:57.400 --> 05:59.000
<i>to which he belongs.</i>

05:59.200 --> 06:02.960
<i>Because he is here on the moor,
most of the other chiefs are here.</i>

06:03.160 --> 06:06.120
<i>Because he is here, Keppoch is here.</i>

06:06.600 --> 06:10.400
Because I feel that
the Act of Union with England

06:10.560 --> 06:11.920
is a betrayal.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.280
Because Prince Charles is a Catholic
and I am a Catholic.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.400
And the king in London
is a Protestant.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.760
Because Charles is part Scot

06:22.920 --> 06:24.960
and I am a Scot.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.320
And the king in London is a German.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.720
<i>Prince Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

06:31.840 --> 06:35.680
<i>the centre of all these men's hopes,
himself half-Polish.</i>

06:36.080 --> 06:38.240
<i>Age 25 and four months,</i>

06:38.360 --> 06:40.520
<i>son of the exiled
James the Pretender,</i>

06:40.640 --> 06:42.640
<i>he landed in Scotland
nine months ago,</i>

06:42.760 --> 06:45.800
<i>raised the clan army
on a Highland surge of nationalism,</i>

06:45.960 --> 06:49.880
<i>marched to Derby and came within an ace
of toppling the Hanoverian dynasty</i>

06:50.000 --> 06:52.560
<i>and regaining the throne
for his father.</i>

06:53.440 --> 06:56.240
<i>Though since forced
to retreat back into the Highlands</i>

06:56.400 --> 06:58.800
<i>and despite
all evidence to the contrary,</i>

06:58.960 --> 07:01.400
<i>Charles remains supremely confident</i>

07:01.560 --> 07:05.280
<i>both of victory and
his welcome by the English people.</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:10.920
King George ll is both
a usurper and a tyrant.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.120
He's kept my father's crown

07:13.240 --> 07:16.560
by enslaving all the people
of this island.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.160
He's deemed unpopular

07:19.280 --> 07:21.480
and I know that once victory is mine

07:21.560 --> 07:24.400
the people of England
will welcome me.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.080
<i>Lord George Murray, age 51.</i>

07:33.200 --> 07:35.560
<i>Lieutenant General in the clan army.</i>

07:35.960 --> 07:37.440
<i>As their commanding officer,</i>

07:37.560 --> 07:40.120
<i>this man forged
the undisciplined Highlanders</i>

07:40.240 --> 07:42.880
<i>into an army that not only
almost reached London</i>

07:43.000 --> 07:45.920
<i>but that also twice reduced
superior English forces</i>

07:46.040 --> 07:47.920
<i>into a panic-stricken rout,</i>

07:48.040 --> 07:51.000
<i>first at Prestonpans,
then at Falkirk.</i>

07:51.320 --> 07:55.440
<i>Blunt, imperious, this man has
bitterly quarreled with Charles</i>

07:55.560 --> 07:58.080
<i>over the chaos
in the army administration</i>

07:58.240 --> 08:01.240
<i>and over the choice
of this battlefield,</i>

08:01.560 --> 08:04.120
<i>chosen by John William O'Sullivan.</i>

08:04.680 --> 08:07.640
<i>Flat, treeless, devoid of shelter,</i>

08:08.240 --> 08:10.400
<i>ideal for the employment
by the British army</i>

08:10.520 --> 08:12.440
<i>of its cannon and cavalry.</i>

08:13.080 --> 08:15.240
<i>And from behind the shelter
of these walls,</i>

08:15.360 --> 08:17.920
<i>which O'Sullivan
has refused to pull down,</i>

08:18.040 --> 08:23.320
<i>Lord George Murray also fears
both crossfire and outflanking.</i>

08:23.960 --> 08:25.160
<i>Mr O'Sullivan,</i>

08:25.320 --> 08:28.160
<i>in view of what Lord George
feels about the battlefield,</i>

08:28.280 --> 08:29.960
<i>have you inspected
the ground yourself?</i>

08:30.120 --> 08:32.480
- No, I have not.
- Why not?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.520
Because I don't deem it necessary.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.039
It is a large, plain moor

08:37.159 --> 08:41.880
and, as such, it's a fair field
for the enemy horse and cannon

08:42.039 --> 08:44.760
against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.160
I have informed His Royal Highness
that it is a good field

08:48.280 --> 08:49.720
which I believe it to be.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.320
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.880
<i>Your Highness,
why are you fighting today,</i>

08:55.000 --> 08:57.920
<i>when the ground here has been
criticized by some of your officers?</i>

08:58.080 --> 08:59.960
Because God is on our side

09:00.080 --> 09:04.640
and I am convinced that my duty
to my people lies in fighting today.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.240
It's my opinion that the choice
of the field for us is suicidal.

09:59.480 --> 10:03.280
<i>9,000 men, 16 battalions of infantry,</i>

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
<i>12 squadrons of cavalry,</i>

10:05.840 --> 10:07.840
<i>8 companies of militia,</i>

10:08.000 --> 10:11.240
<i>220,000 rounds of musket ammunition,</i>

10:11.680 --> 10:14.120
<i>10 three-pounder battalion cannons,</i>

10:14.360 --> 10:16.880
<i>800 three-pound cannonballs,</i>

10:17.160 --> 10:18.840
<i>500 bags of cannon grapeshot.</i>

10:40.280 --> 10:42.400
<i>This man's name is Fraser.</i>

10:42.760 --> 10:46.080
<i>A deserter from the Government army,
he still wears its uniform</i>

10:46.400 --> 10:48.920
<i>but now stands
in the ranks of the Prince's army,</i>

10:49.040 --> 10:51.600
<i>amongst the men
of his own clan and name.</i>

10:51.720 --> 10:54.160
<i>He knows that,
if he is captured as a deserter,</i>

10:54.280 --> 10:58.640
<i>he will be immediately court-martialled
to a sentence of death by throttling.</i>

11:08.160 --> 11:12.640
<i>These are the Wild Geese,
150 exiled Irishmen</i>

11:12.760 --> 11:15.240
<i>sewing in the army
of His Most Christian Majesty,</i>

11:15.360 --> 11:19.440
<i>Louis XV of France, the most
powerful ally of the Stuart cause.</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:22.760
<i>Brigadier General Walter Stapleton,</i>

11:22.880 --> 11:26.040
<i>commander, Irish pickets
of the French army.</i>

11:26.520 --> 11:30.080
Yes, we're here because
Prince Charles is a Catholic.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.800
It will be a fine thing
for all Catholics

11:32.920 --> 11:36.000
when Charlie's on the throne
and German George is off it.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.240
If we had a Catholic king
on the throne in this country,

11:39.480 --> 11:41.280
then we could get back
to living in our own.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.640
You must remember that
your Protestant king in London

11:44.760 --> 11:48.280
is passing penal laws
against the Catholics in Ireland.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.000
I'm from County Tipperary.
Now I've got to live in Boulogne.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.440
You won't find a Catholic Irishman
with much cause to love George ll.

12:00.960 --> 12:05.520
<i>William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland,
third son of King George ll.</i>

12:05.960 --> 12:08.200

<i>Patrick McColman,

12:23.720 --> 12:26.080
<i>two days ago 800 lashes for looting,</i>

12:29.920 --> 12:31.680
<i>John Mallaby, private.</i>

12:31.960 --> 12:33.880
<i>Pressed into service.</i>

12:35.680 --> 12:37.680
<i>William Roach, private.</i>

12:37.800 --> 12:41.000
<i>Two years of his pay would not
buy even the wig and hat</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:43.680

12:43.800 --> 12:46.680
<i>Joshua Ward,

12:49.720 --> 12:51.640
to piety or to common morals

12:51.800 --> 12:54.680
<i>would endanger
the owner to be cashiered.</i>

12:55.320 --> 12:57.160
I will now pass...

12:58.080 --> 13:00.000
in the middle of the second line.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.800
Your Highness.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.080
Give me a battery
in the centre of the front line.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.760
<i>Alexander Laing

13:19.040 --> 13:21.400
<i>firing a ball of

<i>an effective distance of 60 paces.</i>

13:24.320 --> 13:28.480
<i>He carries sufficient ball, paper
and black powder for 24 cartridges.</i>

13:29.520 --> 13:32.200
<i>He carries at his hip
a brass-hiked sword</i>

13:32.320 --> 13:35.240
<i>and a bayonet

13:36.520 --> 13:39.360
<i>Alistair McVurrich

13:39.720 --> 13:41.800
<i>an outdated dragoon pistol</i>

13:41.920 --> 13:44.400
<i>for which he has
no further ammunition.</i>

13:45.120 --> 13:46.960
<i>What's the gun you're sewing?</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:50.080
It's a three-pounder.
Right now, it's downright useless.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.520
<i>Why's that?</i>

13:52.160 --> 13:54.160
We've only got 4 lb ammunition for it.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.640
I tell you, it's chaos.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.040
Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.600
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.480
Ah, well now... that really
is not my responsibility.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.120
<i>But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are
the quartermaster general</i>

14:10.240 --> 14:13.720
<i>and, as such, surely you're responsible
for the distribution of food.</i>

14:13.840 --> 14:16.160
In normal circumstances, yes

14:16.280 --> 14:20.080
but now, as I am much pressed
by other affairs,

14:20.280 --> 14:22.840
I have given that responsibility
to someone else.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.960
<i>When was the last time you ate?</i>

14:29.960 --> 14:31.720
Two days ago.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.280
The day before yesterday.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.520
This morning he killed a pig

14:42.760 --> 14:45.240
but wasn't allowed time to eat it.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.280
I can't remember.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.520
The time is 12:15.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.280
Now this wall,
behind which we're sheltering,

15:03.400 --> 15:07.320
is at approximately right angles
to the rebel lines.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.640
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.880
The rebel lines are here.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.400
We are here.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.400
And the Duke of Cumberland's army
is here.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.800
<i>9,000 men in 16 infantry battalions</i>

15:38.000 --> 15:40.400
<i>three of which are themselves Scot,</i>

15:40.600 --> 15:44.200
<i>a total of 1,300 regular soldiers
from the Lowlands,</i>

15:44.440 --> 15:46.960
<i>plus, in reserve,
the volunteer militias</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:50.000
<i>of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,</i>

15:50.120 --> 15:52.320
<i>a further 8,000 men.</i>

16:00.600 --> 16:02.560
<i>Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:05.680
<i>regent claimant to the thrones
of England and Scotland,</i>

16:05.800 --> 16:09.120
<i>has more Scots-in-arms
against him than for him.</i>

16:15.200 --> 16:17.200
<i>And, ranged against him
in the Highlands,</i>

16:17.320 --> 16:19.680
<i>he has the Whig clans
siding with the Government,</i>

16:19.800 --> 16:21.880
<i>the Munros, the Rosses,
the MacKenzies,</i>

16:22.000 --> 16:24.320
<i>the McLeods of Skye, the Sutherlands,</i>

16:24.440 --> 16:28.360
<i>and here on the moor,
the Campbells of the Argyll militia.</i>

16:34.600 --> 16:38.760
<i>Here to fight Charles and his
rebellion, here to take clan revenge,</i>

16:38.880 --> 16:40.920
<i>Angus Ian Campbell,</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:43.840
<i>wife murdered by the MacDonalds.</i>

16:46.360 --> 16:50.680
<i>Alistair MacDonald, brother
killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.</i>

16:51.280 --> 16:54.520
<i>For him, loyalties to Charlie
mean little.</i>

16:54.800 --> 16:58.360
<i>For him,
today's battle is a clan battle.</i>

16:58.920 --> 17:03.080
The swords those bastards use
can cut a man in half.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.920
Well, I reckon
we'll have them this time.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.359
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.560
You don't poke
at the man in front of you.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.599
You poke at the man
coming at your chum on the right.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.960
That means,
as he's lifting his sword arm,

17:20.160 --> 17:21.920
you get him underneath, like.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.520
<i>What do you think about the rebels?</i>

17:25.760 --> 17:30.640
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off
for six weeks.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.400
I reckon till we lay
them bastards out I won't, neither.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.480
I'll tell you one thing.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.760
I know a lot of the boys
make fun of our Billy Cumberland

17:39.960 --> 17:41.880
but I reckon he's all right.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
He's a tough bastard
but at least he feeds you

17:44.520 --> 17:46.720
which is more than some of them do.

17:46.840 --> 17:51.360
I've heard said the rebels want to cut
him as small as herbs for the pot.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.280
Well... I don't reckon that.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.840
They're a lot of friggin' savages.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.200
<i>Donald Gram, a farmer,</i>

18:00.360 --> 18:03.040
<i>forced a month ago
into the Highland army,</i>

18:03.160 --> 18:06.040
<i>twice has deserted
back to farm and family,</i>

18:06.200 --> 18:09.320
<i>twice has been captured
and forced to return.</i>

18:10.360 --> 18:12.480
<i>Euan MacDonald, farmer,</i>

18:13.320 --> 18:17.080
<i>forced into the Highland army
the day before yesterday.</i>

18:17.560 --> 18:20.480
<i>With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,</i>

18:20.880 --> 18:23.240
<i>the day before yesterday a ploughboy,</i>

18:23.360 --> 18:25.480
<i>today a rebel in arms.</i>

18:25.680 --> 18:27.320
<i>His age, 13.</i>

18:35.920 --> 18:39.800
I can't just make out
what's happening in the rebel lines.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.880
There's much confusion of movement.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.880
Large numbers of men are moving about,
changing their position...

18:50.320 --> 18:53.120
and there are large gaps
in the centre.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.600
It seems to me as though
the entire line is completely askew.

18:58.000 --> 18:58.920
<i>Why is this?</i>

18:59.040 --> 19:01.680
We are all MacDonalds and, as such,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.600
we are entitled to stand
on the right in the line of battle.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.160
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege

19:11.840 --> 19:14.400
and yet Mr O'Sullivan

19:14.520 --> 19:18.520
has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men

19:19.400 --> 19:20.680
in that position.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.920
The main reason is that
yesterday the Prince had an idea

19:25.080 --> 19:28.760
for a surprise march by night
on the camp of Cumberland.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.600
This we attempted. It failed.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.320
But it meant that we were
all up marching the entire night.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.640
Consequently, the men are exhausted

19:38.720 --> 19:41.440
and are still stumbling
into their positions.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.160
<i>What effect has this had
on your men?</i>

19:45.360 --> 19:46.920
Look at them.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.280
<i>When did you last sleep?</i>

19:55.840 --> 19:57.920
As far as I am concerned,

19:58.080 --> 20:01.160
we are now putting an end
to a bad affair.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.840
The Scots are fair fighters
until a crisis is reached

20:05.280 --> 20:07.840
and it's my opinion
we've now reached that crisis.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.200
With all these things amiss
in our army,

20:11.400 --> 20:14.440
it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.600
<i>Bu! Charles
has made no plans for retreat.</i>

20:17.720 --> 20:21.560
<i>He says that only those who are
afraid can doubt his coming victory.</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:24.400
<i>He puts from his mind
the discontent of the MacDonalds,</i>

20:24.560 --> 20:26.600
<i>the fatigue and hunger of his men,</i>

20:26.720 --> 20:28.880
<i>the total outnumbering of his army,</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:30.680
<i>the thinning of ranks by desertion,</i>

20:30.800 --> 20:32.720
<i>the ill choice of battlefield,</i>

20:32.880 --> 20:37.080
<i>convinced as he is
of the invincibility of his men.</i>

20:37.280 --> 20:39.400
God is on our side.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.240
Our cause is just
and we will triumph this day.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.400
The soldiers in the Elector's army
know me to be their lawful Prince.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.840
And so I'm convinced
they'll break in panic,

20:51.960 --> 20:54.840
for they will never dare fight me.

20:55.240 --> 20:59.400
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.600
<i>This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.</i>

21:28.000 --> 21:32.040
<i>A private in the Government army,
he is also a Highland Scot.</i>

21:33.280 --> 21:37.560
<i>This man's name too is Chisholm,
Roderick Og Chisholm.</i>

21:38.240 --> 21:39.600
<i>Fifth son of the clan chief,</i>

21:39.720 --> 21:42.640
<i>he stands before his men
in the Prince's army.</i>

21:43.160 --> 21:47.000
<i>The Chisholm 500 yards away
is this man's brother.</i>

21:48.520 --> 21:52.080
<i>Charles Edward Stuart's war
is a civil war.</i>

21:59.960 --> 22:03.040
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.800
The cannon have opened
from the rebels' centre

22:06.920 --> 22:09.280
and they're over-elevated.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.800
Fire!

22:14.280 --> 22:14.960
Batteries...

22:16.600 --> 22:18.400
from open sights...

22:18.840 --> 22:21.800
at will... fire!

22:22.360 --> 22:23.480
Pull!

22:23.920 --> 22:25.080
Fire!

22:27.800 --> 22:29.120
Fire!

22:30.000 --> 22:32.160
That's the Duke of Cumberland's
cannons.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.800
Cannonades all around me!

22:37.000 --> 22:39.600
I'm going to have to shout
to make myself heard!

22:46.520 --> 22:50.120
The smoke
is beginning to thicken.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.760
It's going to be very difficult

22:52.920 --> 22:57.400
to see what effect our cannon
is having on the rebel lines.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.440
<i>A cast-iron ball of three pounds'
weight, fired from open sights.</i>

23:16.600 --> 23:20.000
<i>This is roundshot.
This is what it does.</i>

23:20.720 --> 23:22.200
Pull!

23:26.480 --> 23:31.320
<i>Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.</i>

23:35.840 --> 23:40.920
<i>Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.</i>

23:43.560 --> 23:47.360
<i>Ian MacDonald, age 13. Shot.</i>

23:50.360 --> 23:51.600
<i>1:12.</i>

23:52.000 --> 23:55.040
<i>Dazed, indecisive, Charles
has moved to behind</i>

23:55.160 --> 23:57.280
<i>the right ﬂank of the Jacobite lines</i>

23:57.400 --> 24:00.600
<i>and is now unable to see
what is happening to his army.</i>

24:10.760 --> 24:13.600
<i>Ordered by O'Sullivan
to stand in the ranks six-deep,</i>

24:13.720 --> 24:15.240
<i>the men on the Highland right</i>

24:15.360 --> 24:18.600
<i>make a clear and tight-packed target
for the English gunners.</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:26.120
Pull!

24:29.120 --> 24:32.560
The rebels' artillery
have stopped firing altogether

24:33.000 --> 24:35.640
and, before they did, we counted...
How many?

24:36.760 --> 24:40.480
We counted 15 to 20 shots
fired by our artillery

24:40.720 --> 24:42.800
for every one fired by the rebels.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.240
<i>1:17.</i>

24:45.400 --> 24:48.440
<i>The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.</i>

24:48.800 --> 24:52.760
<i>The Prince's artillery, iii-fed
by a sporadic ammunition supply,</i>

24:52.960 --> 24:55.320
<i>ill-served by untrained amateurs,</i>

24:55.520 --> 24:56.920
<i>ceases fire.</i>

24:57.240 --> 24:58.440
Pull!

25:02.800 --> 25:04.640
<i>Have you had orders to attack, sir?</i>

25:04.800 --> 25:07.240
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?

25:07.360 --> 25:09.240
The Prince hasn't given any!

25:09.360 --> 25:12.400
If he doesn't give them soon,
he'll lose the entire army!

25:12.520 --> 25:14.160
We're being shelled to pieces!

25:34.640 --> 25:35.880
Pull!

25:37.560 --> 25:39.000
Reload!

25:40.960 --> 25:42.240
Pull!

25:53.560 --> 25:54.640
Reload!

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
<i>- What's the Prince doing?
- I don't know!</i>

26:16.120 --> 26:18.240
Nobody knows what he's doing!

26:18.400 --> 26:21.680
<i>1:22. Prince Charles Stuart,
paralyzed with indecision,</i>

26:21.800 --> 26:25.720
<i>still has given no order,
either to advance or to retreat.</i>

26:26.160 --> 26:30.680
<i>1:22. Clan Cameron,
200 men, shot to pieces.</i>

26:30.800 --> 26:34.000
<i>Clan Stewart,
180 men, shot to pieces.</i>

26:35.480 --> 26:37.320
This is fantastic!

26:37.440 --> 26:39.400
If this keeps up much longer,

26:39.520 --> 26:42.040
our gunners will have
finished the whole affair.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.040
The cannonade... The cannonade
has given our men infinite spirits.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.960
<i>Clan Chisholm casualties,
47 killed or maimed.</i>

26:59.280 --> 27:03.360
This is incredible! Those men have
been standing there for 22 minutes!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.240
They're just lining the ranks!

27:07.280 --> 27:10.440
The rebels are being
literally blown apart!

27:10.920 --> 27:14.560
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?

27:16.360 --> 27:19.240
<i>1:30. Still no order to advance.</i>

27:19.360 --> 27:23.320
<i>Clan army casualties,
700 dead or maimed.</i>

27:37.760 --> 27:39.680
<i>Charles Stuart hopes
that by not advancing</i>

27:39.800 --> 27:43.960
<i>he will tempt the Government army
out of its battle lines to attack him.</i>

27:44.280 --> 27:47.200
<i>1:32 pm. Cumberland orders a move</i>

27:48.480 --> 27:50.880
<i>but not the one
his cousin is expecting.</i>

27:51.360 --> 27:54.320
I want Wolfe's battalion
to advance inside on the left!

27:54.440 --> 27:55.160
Your Highness!

28:00.120 --> 28:02.880
<i>At 1:32, Cumberland places a battalion</i>

28:03.000 --> 28:06.400
<i>behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,</i>

28:07.320 --> 28:09.240
<i>to fire into the side
of the clan army</i>

28:09.400 --> 28:11.440
<i>when it charges
the Government front.</i>

28:12.000 --> 28:15.640
<i>This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.</i>

28:26.120 --> 28:31.320
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll...
the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?

28:31.480 --> 28:34.720
And there are squadrons
of dragoons with them.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.960
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided

28:39.120 --> 28:43.800
to have units of the Campbell-Argyll
militia and some squadrons of dragoons

28:43.920 --> 28:47.840
to go down behind
the south side of this wall,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.480
out of sight of the enemy,

28:49.600 --> 28:53.160
to take them in the rear
and outflank the rebels.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.720
<i>Thus, also at 1:32 pm,</i>

28:56.840 --> 28:58.920
<i>begins the outﬂanking movement</i>

28:59.040 --> 29:01.800
<i>that O'Sullivan
said would never happen.</i>

29:03.400 --> 29:06.600
<i>29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance</i>

29:06.720 --> 29:09.480
<i>along the entire from
of the Jacobite army.</i>

29:11.800 --> 29:14.120
And you make the right side advance!

29:19.800 --> 29:22.760
<i>Bu! The message
fails to reach the right wing.</i>

29:23.480 --> 29:26.360
<i>Casualties, 850.</i>

29:31.240 --> 29:33.560
<i>Have you still had
no orders to attack?</i>

29:33.680 --> 29:35.560
No! I've had no orders!

29:35.680 --> 29:38.480
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan,

29:38.600 --> 29:41.880
which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!

29:42.000 --> 29:43.840
- The line's broken up!
- What?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.720
They're charging,
they're coming straight at us!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.880
Sir, the right has broken forward!

29:54.600 --> 29:55.720
The walls will hold them.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.200
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!

30:05.040 --> 30:08.480
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?

30:09.080 --> 30:11.720
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!

30:14.040 --> 30:16.520
<i>A cylindrical canvas bag
eight inches in length,</i>

30:16.600 --> 30:19.400
<i>packed with musketballs
and pieces of jagged iron.</i>

30:19.600 --> 30:22.400
<i>This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.</i>

30:22.520 --> 30:23.800
Pull!

30:28.560 --> 30:29.560
Pull!

30:35.200 --> 30:38.000
It must be the grape! The centre
has collided with the right.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.800
There's great confusion,
bodies flying!

31:03.160 --> 31:05.720
They must be going to receive fire
from our centre battalions!

31:18.520 --> 31:20.720
Charge! Charge!

31:28.240 --> 31:29.920
Fire!

31:34.600 --> 31:35.520
Bastards!

31:39.560 --> 31:40.960
God, they're almost upon us!

31:48.240 --> 31:50.960
They're firing from this side
and from this side.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.680
They're been cut to pieces!

31:52.760 --> 31:54.680

34:35.440 --> 34:37.199
They've broken through Barrell's!

34:44.000 --> 34:47.320
General Huske, advance Bligh's
and Semphill's, support on the left.

<i>trying to tempt the royal army lines
forward in disorder.</i>

35:25.200 --> 35:28.560
Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!

35:43.320 --> 35:45.080
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!

35:53.320 --> 35:58.560
<i>1:58. The MacDonalds, dismayed at

<i>Keppoch, one of their leaders,</i>

<i>The rout of the Highland army begins.</i>

36:18.520 --> 36:20.240
Christ, they're running.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.120
They're leaving the field
except for two small units,

36:23.320 --> 36:25.000
the French and the Irish.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.560
Let them through. Stand your ground.

36:58.440 --> 37:00.360

Where are you going, you?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.760
<i>Charles Stuart
tries to rally his men.</i>

37:58.960 --> 38:01.760
<i>"Pray stand with me, your Prince,"

38:01.840 --> 38:04.840
<i>"Pray stand with me but a moment,

<i>But it is too late.</i>

<i>At one minute past two

<i>Charles Edward Stuart

<i>by the man most responsible
for his defeat.</i>

38:19.800 --> 38:24.080
<i>As Charles leaves, a senior
clan officer screams after him,</i>

38:24.160 --> 38:26.600
<i>"Run, you cowardly Italian."</i>

38:27.240 --> 38:28.480
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?

38:28.600 --> 38:31.400
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.520
<i>Of the 9,000 men of the royal army</i>

39:02.920 --> 39:05.280
<i>who advanced this morning from Naim
with Private Laing,</i>

39:06.080 --> 39:08.880
<i>an estimated 50 are dead.</i>

39:10.920 --> 39:13.720
<i>Bu! For every one corpse

39:14.320 --> 39:17.040
<i>there are 24 in the clan army.</i>

39:19.480 --> 39:22.440
<i>Piled in layers, dead or dying,</i>

39:22.600 --> 39:24.840
<i>are 1,200 men...</i>

39:27.760 --> 39:31.560
<i>including the brother
of Private James Chisholm.</i>

39:33.360 --> 39:36.880
<i>There was scarce a soldier or officer
of Barrell's Fourth of Foot</i>

39:37.200 --> 39:41.160
<i>who did not kill one or two men each
with their bayonets or spontoons.</i>

39:41.880 --> 39:44.640
<i>Not a bayonet but was bent
and stained with blood</i>

39:44.760 --> 39:46.680
<i>to the muzzles of their muskets.</i>

39:47.560 --> 39:51.560
<i>All witnesses agreed that, if
grapeshot were the king of battles,</i>

39:52.280 --> 39:55.240
<i>the bayonet was now
the queen of weapons.</i>

39:56.360 --> 40:00.040
<i>"It is mine and everybody': opinion,"
boasts a trooper,</i>

40:00.200 --> 40:04.160
<i>"that no history can brag
of so singular a victory."</i>

40:06.880 --> 40:08.320
<i>How do you feel?</i>

40:11.280 --> 40:13.360
Don't feel nothing, really.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.080
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.120
Battalion, take care!

41:04.760 --> 41:06.080
Halt!

41:08.280 --> 41:11.320
<i>2:14pm. The battalions
of Cumberland</i>

41:11.480 --> 41:16.360
<i>halt at the lines held by the rebels
one hour and eight minutes ago.</i>

41:19.920 --> 41:23.000
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!

41:26.080 --> 41:28.880
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!

41:29.240 --> 41:31.360
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!

41:31.640 --> 41:35.200
<i>Thus has ended the last battle
to be fought in Britain</i>

41:35.360 --> 41:39.000
<i>and the last armed attempt
to overthrow its king.</i>

41:39.880 --> 41:43.920
<i>The Establishment has been saved,
peace restored,</i>

41:44.040 --> 41:48.360
<i>Church, Crown,
trade and commerce safeguarded.</i>

41:54.680 --> 41:58.360
<i>Thus the Duke of Cumberland
won his only victory</i>

41:58.800 --> 42:01.720
<i>and Charles suffered his only defeat.</i>

42:02.000 --> 42:05.720
<i>His advisers are shortly to urge
his instructions for reassembly.</i>

42:05.840 --> 42:10.320
<i>"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“</i>

42:10.840 --> 42:14.360
<i>Charles Edward Stuart,
his cause now in ruins,</i>

42:15.120 --> 42:17.240
<i>has given one order too many.</i>

42:21.200 --> 42:25.120
<i>Charles pitted these men against
the modem musket and bayonet,</i>

42:25.360 --> 42:27.520
<i>against cavalry and cannon.</i>

42:28.440 --> 42:31.040
<i>Thus, in one hour, eight minutes,</i>

42:31.800 --> 42:34.560
<i>he has reduced
the ﬂower of the Highland clans</i>

42:34.840 --> 42:37.240
<i>to twitching, limbless corpses.</i>

42:54.040 --> 42:57.360
<i>2:30 pm and His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Cumberland,</i>

42:57.480 --> 43:01.400
<i>orders rum and brandy, cheese
and biscuits for his “brave boys.“</i>

43:04.720 --> 43:07.440
<i>For the wounded and dying clansmen
on the moor,</i>

43:07.560 --> 43:09.520
<i>there is to be different treatment.</i>

43:27.360 --> 43:31.280
<i>All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,</i>

43:31.400 --> 43:33.840
<i>any clansmen seen to be still alive</i>

43:33.960 --> 43:37.120
<i>is either slit in the throat,
pistolled through the head</i>

43:37.240 --> 43:41.200
<i>or bayonetted and trampled on
until, in the words of an eyewitness,</i>

43:41.280 --> 43:43.520
<i>"the moor was covered with blood"</i>

43:43.640 --> 43:46.560
<i>"and our British soldiers
looked less like Christian men"</i>

43:46.680 --> 43:47.800
<i>"than so many butchers."</i>

43:47.920 --> 43:49.800
What about some grub?

43:52.280 --> 43:55.760
This rebel host has been
most deeply indebted to the public

43:55.920 --> 43:58.880
for all the rapine,
murder and cruelty

43:59.000 --> 44:03.080
and our men are heartily determined
to give them receipt in full.

44:04.920 --> 44:05.760
Cut him!

44:07.200 --> 44:10.400
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!

44:23.920 --> 44:26.720
I'm letting my regiments of horse
loose after the battle

44:26.840 --> 44:29.400
in order they may have some sweets
with all their fatigue.

44:46.320 --> 44:49.240
<i>Thus nearly 100 people
are to be butchered or maimed</i>

44:49.400 --> 44:51.280
<i>on the road to Inverness.</i>

44:53.600 --> 44:57.760
<i>Butchered whether or not
they took any part in the battle.</i>

45:01.840 --> 45:03.840
They took my baby.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.040
He's only two weeks old.

45:09.240 --> 45:14.160
And one of them
whirled him around by his leg...

45:15.320 --> 45:17.320
and threw him on to the ground.

45:18.240 --> 45:21.440
<i>This is Jean Clark, aged 28.</i>

45:21.760 --> 45:24.160
<i>Cut about the face and body
by sabres,</i>

45:24.360 --> 45:27.800
<i>she was left lying for dead
on the road to Inverness.</i>

45:30.360 --> 45:33.120
The soldiers came in and caught him,
and Daddy too

45:33.320 --> 45:35.880
but I got away
through a hole in the wall.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.160
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.520
I don't... I don't know
where he and Daddy are now.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.120
Come on, you!

45:48.240 --> 45:50.680
<i>4 pm. Inverness.</i>

45:54.720 --> 45:57.720
<i>James Rae: trooper,
Kingston's Light Horse,</i>

45:58.160 --> 46:01.440
<i>the first man of Cumberland': army
to enter the Highland capital,</i>

46:01.600 --> 46:03.640
<i>the first man to show its inhabitants</i>

46:03.800 --> 46:05.800
<i>what is to be expected
from an Englishman</i>

46:05.920 --> 46:09.360
<i>protecting his liberty
and his Protestant religion.</i>

46:30.400 --> 46:33.600
There was these two men,
shouting and screaming.

46:34.520 --> 46:39.880
And then he came out
and there was blood on his hands.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.320
<i>These troopers from the Duke
of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment</i>

46:44.440 --> 46:46.000
<i>are later to be commended
by Cumberland</i>

46:46.160 --> 46:48.320
<i>for their "zeal in the pursuit."</i>

46:48.440 --> 46:50.360
<i>Each of them comes from Nottingham.</i>

46:50.480 --> 46:53.040
<i>Each of them by trade is a butcher.</i>

46:54.360 --> 46:57.720
<i>James Rae himself, who, like the other
troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,</i>

46:57.840 --> 47:00.520
<i>played his pan in the battle
when it was over,</i>

47:00.640 --> 47:02.120
<i>is later to return to Nottingham,</i>

47:02.240 --> 47:04.320
<i>where his regimental colours

<i>His cousin Charles, until today the

Yes... Yes, I did.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.920
<i>What did he die of?</i>

51:03.160 --> 51:06.040
This one? He died of shock,
if I remember correctly.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.440
Why was that?

51:07.600 --> 51:10.160
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.

51:13.400 --> 51:17.440
Do you know what...
what is our young Billy's pleasure

51:17.720 --> 51:21.240
because we fought
with such gallantry?

51:21.920 --> 51:25.600
His Royal Highness thanks
all ye officers and men

51:25.720 --> 51:27.280
for their gallant behaviour.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.280
Get out of it! Leave off!

51:29.640 --> 51:33.240
His Royal Highness releases
all ye military prisoners

51:33.800 --> 51:37.240
who were this day
in custody of the provost.

51:37.560 --> 51:41.080
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.

51:41.160 --> 51:44.880
They're gonna pay 12 guineas
out of the Duke's own purse

51:45.080 --> 51:47.520
for all those wounded in the battle.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.640
<i>For Lachlan MacDonald,</i>

51:53.960 --> 51:57.960
<i>who's been now lying on the moor
two days with a severed right leg,</i>

51:58.520 --> 52:00.320
<i>there'll be no 12 guineas.</i>

52:07.000 --> 52:10.560
<i>Orders for Friday 18th April 1746.</i>

52:11.320 --> 52:13.640
<i>"A captain and 40 foot
to march directly"</i>

52:13.760 --> 52:14.960
<i>"and visit all the cottages"</i>

52:15.040 --> 52:17.520
<i>"in the neighbourhood
of the field of battle."</i>

52:17.680 --> 52:20.040
<i>"The officers and men
will take notice"</i>

52:20.160 --> 52:23.760
<i>"that the public order of the rebels
on the day of battle"</i>

52:23.960 --> 52:26.000
<i>"was to give us no quarter."</i>

52:29.400 --> 52:31.000
Line up the bodies, men.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.840
Come on, quick as you can.

52:39.520 --> 52:41.520
There's another one over there.

52:47.360 --> 52:50.720
<i>The public orders of the rebels
to give no mercy to the royal army</i>

52:50.920 --> 52:53.760
<i>do not exist in any other form
than a crude forgery</i>

52:53.880 --> 52:56.760
<i>alleged to have been found
on the field of battle.</i>

52:57.280 --> 53:00.080
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.520
<i>Bu! Whether he knows this
public order is a forgery or not,</i>

53:03.640 --> 53:08.920
<i>Cumberland makes it his excuse
to authorize what now happens.</i>

53:11.920 --> 53:15.360
Battalion, present your firelock...

53:18.760 --> 53:21.080
at the man in front of you.

53:21.720 --> 53:22.920
Fire!

53:23.720 --> 53:26.320
<i>The officer in charge
of this execution squad</i>

53:26.440 --> 53:28.400
<i>is himself a Scotsman.</i>

53:28.680 --> 53:32.400
<i>Captain Scott, are many of the rebels
being killed in this fashion?</i>

53:32.560 --> 53:33.960
As many as we can find.

53:34.480 --> 53:37.120
I don't know how many men
have been killed in this fashion.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.720
I fear to think.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.400
But just this morning I heard
a Campbell officer saying that,

53:42.600 --> 53:46.360
in just one area, he himself
saw 72 wounded rebels

53:46.520 --> 53:48.200
shot or clubbed on the head.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.880
Yes, I saw what was done.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.200
<i>Did you agree with it?</i>

53:52.360 --> 53:54.160
No, of course I didn't.

53:54.280 --> 53:58.240
I will always thank God that I had
nothing to do with the black work.

53:58.960 --> 54:02.440
You must try to remember that
this is a most difficult problem.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.480
I have talked much with officers
from Lowland Scots regiments

54:06.760 --> 54:09.120
and they undoubtedly feel
that these Highlanders

54:09.240 --> 54:12.240
are threatening their culture,
their Protestant religion.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.360
They're threatening to disrupt
their peace and their commerce.

54:18.120 --> 54:21.400
There's a great feeling of insecurity
in the Lowlands.

54:21.560 --> 54:24.800
These people still remember
the Highland host.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.800
They still remember the years
of cattle thieves and murder,

54:28.080 --> 54:30.440
men coming down at night
from the hills

54:30.520 --> 54:34.160
and extorting blackmail
under pain of being robbed.

54:35.400 --> 54:38.400
You see, the Highlander
talks a different language.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.920
He wears different clothes...

54:41.680 --> 54:46.080
and he undoubtedly has
some uncouth and barbaric practices.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.920
For all these reasons,

54:49.440 --> 54:51.000
I think you'll find most Lowlanders

54:51.120 --> 54:53.520
hold the man
from this part of the country

54:53.640 --> 54:55.440
in contempt and hatred.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.040
Much more so
even than the English do.

54:58.440 --> 55:01.480
<i>Why is your army treating the
prisoners and the wounded like this?</i>

55:01.640 --> 55:04.800
<i>Of yourself, it's been said you're
keeping the prisoners in Inverness</i>

55:04.960 --> 55:07.000
<i>without warmth, food and water.</i>

55:07.120 --> 55:09.920
<i>And that you're even withholding
medical dressings from them.</i>

55:10.080 --> 55:12.200
<i>Surely this is against
all bounds of humanity.</i>

55:12.320 --> 55:15.520
Look, I think the point
somewhat eludes you.

55:15.960 --> 55:18.360
These men are rebels and barbarians

55:18.520 --> 55:22.840
and as such are to be rated as cattle
and treated as cattle.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.160
Get that thing
back out the way, please.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.640
<i>For three days and nights
since the battle,</i>

55:28.800 --> 55:31.760
<i>these men, many of them
stripped of their clothes,</i>

55:31.880 --> 55:34.400
<i>many of them dying
from gaping wounds,</i>

55:34.520 --> 55:37.080
<i>have been lying in cold attics
and clamp cellars,</i>

55:37.160 --> 55:40.920
<i>awaiting removal to the prison ships
anchored in the firth.</i>

55:41.200 --> 55:42.920
<i>The British army authorities</i>

55:43.040 --> 55:45.440
<i>have withheld from them
even medical dressings,</i>

55:45.560 --> 55:48.640
<i>thus hoping to solve
the acute lack of prison space</i>

55:48.760 --> 55:52.240
<i>by ensuring
the mortality rate remains high.</i>

55:52.720 --> 55:54.680
<i>They get no food, no light,</i>

55:55.240 --> 55:57.160
<i>no medical dressing.</i>

55:58.120 --> 55:59.640
Get their headgear
while you're about it.

55:59.880 --> 56:01.480
The belt here, too.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.960
The smell in here is terrible.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.600
This man next to me...

56:13.640 --> 56:15.760
I think he's dead.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.680
The way they are treating us,

56:19.880 --> 56:22.240
you'd think we were just animals.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.520
<i>Robert MacLean, salmon fisher.</i>

56:28.040 --> 56:31.360
<i>To be tried without defence
at an English trial,</i>

56:31.480 --> 56:35.240
<i>of which he is able to understand
not a word spoken.</i>

56:35.760 --> 56:38.480
<i>His sentence, execution at York</i>

56:38.680 --> 56:41.240
<i>by being hanged, drawn and quartered.</i>

56:41.480 --> 56:42.960
Check these shackles
while you're about it.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.000
<i>Ranald MacDonald, farmer.</i>

56:47.320 --> 56:50.680
<i>To wait in prison 14 months
for a trial.</i>

56:50.800 --> 56:54.680
<i>Then sentenced at Brampton to be
pulled through its streets on a sled</i>

56:55.120 --> 56:58.120
<i>and hanged, drawn and quartered.</i>

56:59.840 --> 57:03.280
<i>Charles Edward Stuart, believing
the Scots to have betrayed him,</i>

57:03.480 --> 57:05.400
<i>refuses to listen
to last-minute pleas</i>

57:05.520 --> 57:07.600
<i>to stay and fight in the mountains.</i>

57:07.720 --> 57:11.600
<i>Curtly and without a word of thanks
he dismisses the Highland army.</i>

57:11.760 --> 57:14.080
<i>In his saddlebags
the last of the Jacobite funds,</i>

57:14.200 --> 57:16.480
<i>which he has now decided
to keep for himself,</i>

57:16.600 --> 57:19.560
<i>his need, he estimates,
being greater.</i>

57:20.720 --> 57:22.760
<i>Alistair John Stewart,</i>

57:23.120 --> 57:27.320
<i>to lie 10 days in prison, untended,
with a broken leg.</i>

57:28.120 --> 57:30.880
<i>To die on the 11th day of gangrene.</i>

57:31.760 --> 57:34.880
<i>John William O'Sullivan,
soon to be safely in Rome.</i>

57:35.600 --> 57:38.280
<i>To tell King James of the good part
he has played in the rising</i>

57:39.000 --> 57:41.600
<i>and to promptly receive
first a knighthood</i>

57:41.720 --> 57:43.640
<i>and then a baronetcy.</i>

57:45.120 --> 57:48.960
<i>Alexander Sutherland,
never brought to trial.</i>

57:49.960 --> 57:51.640
<i>Disposal unknown.</i>

57:57.840 --> 57:59.360
<i>Lord George Murray,</i>

57:59.520 --> 58:02.560
<i>who to the end blamed Prince Charles
and his Irish administration</i>

58:02.680 --> 58:04.360
<i>for the defeat at Culloden,</i>

58:04.480 --> 58:09.360
<i>is soon to leave Scotland forever,
forced to seek exile in Europe.</i>

58:11.760 --> 58:15.240
<i>Prince Charles refuses to see him
again and never forgives him,</i>

58:15.400 --> 58:17.600
<i>blaming his opposition
to his administration</i>

58:17.680 --> 58:20.040
<i>for the downfall
of the Stuart cause.</i>

58:20.160 --> 58:22.440
Bad day for us all, this.

58:23.440 --> 58:26.480
<i>Lord George Murray, estimated by some</i>

58:26.600 --> 58:29.760
<i>as one of the most brilliant generals
of the 18th century,</i>

58:30.160 --> 58:32.440
<i>who, if left to his own counsel,</i>

58:32.520 --> 58:36.040
<i>could perhaps
have turned Culloden into a victory.</i>

58:38.880 --> 58:40.640
<i>Keep in step, now!</i>

58:43.760 --> 58:48.320
<i>May 23rd. The British army moves
to Fort Augustus in the Great Glen.</i>

58:48.480 --> 58:51.560
<i>From here, the centre link
in a chain of forts and garrisons</i>

58:51.680 --> 58:55.600
<i>stretching from Inverness in the east
to Tobermory in the west,</i>

58:55.720 --> 58:59.240
<i>from Bernera in the north
to Dumbarton in the south,</i>

58:59.360 --> 59:01.840
<i>the Duke of Cumberland mounts
what he terms,</i>

59:02.000 --> 59:04.960
<i>"the pacification of the Highlands."</i>

59:05.080 --> 59:07.040
Patrol of Bligh's,

59:07.680 --> 59:11.840
you will proceed on police action
to Lochaber,

59:12.240 --> 59:15.400
with sufficient rations for two days.

59:15.800 --> 59:19.360
All right, lads. Fall out
and pick up your firelocks.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.200
Move it!

59:25.640 --> 59:29.240
<i>Lord Sackville, what is the function
of these patrols.</i>

59:29.440 --> 59:33.280
Their function is to march
deep into the glens

59:33.400 --> 59:35.760
occupied by the rebels
and their families

59:35.880 --> 59:38.680
and there, by vigorous police action,

59:38.840 --> 59:43.280
ensure that never again will these
people disturb the peace of our land.

59:47.280 --> 59:50.560
<i>May 30th. A military patrol
under Lord George Sackville</i>

59:50.720 --> 59:53.120
<i>strikes deep into a corrie
in Lochaber,</i>

59:53.280 --> 59:55.440
<i>searching for
fugitive rebel families.</i>

59:56.480 --> 59:57.840
<i>This is one of them,</i>

59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.520
<i>sheltering from the rain 1,500 feet
up the side of a hill face.</i>

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.360
<i>Andrew McEachan, aged 25,</i>

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.400
<i>who stood at Culloden,
and who now, because of the patrols,</i>

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.800
<i>has to hide in the hills
like an animal.</i>

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.040
<i>This is his wife, child
and a friend called Mrs MacInnis.</i>

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.520
<i>They have each been out in the open
for the past eight days.</i>

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.960
<i>This girl is suffering from
severe ﬂux</i>

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.040
<i>as a result of damp clothes.</i>

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.320
<i>The last meal this baby ate
was a small fish caught yesterday</i>

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400
<i>and shared between the children.</i>

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.760
<i>This little girl, forced
to leave her home suddenly,</i>

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.480
<i>has only a thin dress,
a damp shawl and no shoes.</i>

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.600
<i>At approximately 12 noon, May 30th,</i>

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.680
<i>the family is sighted by the patrol.</i>

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.840
<i>This is what happens.</i>

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.880
Right, then!

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.680
NO! No!

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.880
I dunno.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.600
All these officers keep telling us

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.560
these people up here
are a load of savages, but...

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.880
I dunno, they looked like ordinary
women and children up there to me.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.560
I didn't like it, what We did.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.480
I didn't like it at all.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.840
Look, let me tell you something.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.240
I had a mate at Falkirk.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.240
He had his head split open.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.960
Like that.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.800
So don't try and make me
go all weeping, like,

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.440
over what happens
to these bastards. Eh?

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.600
Just don't try it!

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.920
<i>Well satisfied with the result
of his military occupation,</i>

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.120
<i>Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.</i>

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.400
<i>He leaves behind him, to finish
the destruction of the rebel clans,</i>

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.760
<i>not only an immense concentration
of English and Lowland troops,</i>

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.560
<i>not only the zealous help
of all the Whig clans,</i>

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.600
<i>but even the help of the chief
of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,</i>

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.960
<i>son of the Gram clan chief,</i>

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.840
<i>who has hastily
reorganized his loyalties</i>

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.080
<i>and just delivered 82 of his own
rebel clansmen to Cumberland</i>

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.880
<i>for transportation to the Barbados,</i>

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.360
<i>as proof of his unswerving allegiance
to the Crown.</i>

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.760
<i>Cumberland himself is to receive
from London a tumultuous welcome.</i>

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.160
<i>From the Government,
a raise in salary of £25,000.</i>

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.720
<i>From George Frederick Handel</i>

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.000
a choral work,
See The Conquering Hero Comes.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.680
<i>From the public,
his name for a ﬂower, Sweet William.</i>

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.760
<i>From the Scots,
his name for a weed, Stinking Billy.</i>

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.400
<i>Month after month,
the British army patrols</i>

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.440
<i>scour every hill range and glen
of northern Scotland</i>

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.200
<i>in an attempt, as Cumberland puts it,</i>

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.640
<i>"to wear down this generation
until there be peace in the land.“".</i>

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.840
<i>The patrols leave behind them
a trail of brutality and suffering</i>

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.800
<i>that is to earn for their commander
undying loathing</i>

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.880
<i>and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.</i>

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.640
<i>These three of his officers have
already burnt, smashed, raped,</i>

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.240
<i>looted and bayonetted their way

<i>committing,
in the name of pacification,</i>

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.640
<i>the worst atrocities
in the history of the British army.</i>

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.240
<i>Captain Caroline Frederick Scott,
Lowlander.</i>

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.280
I agree with
the senior staff officer,

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.760
who has proposed that £5 be paid

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.280
for the head of every rebel
brought to Fort Augustus.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.880
<i>Major lain Lockhart, Lowlander.</i>

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.360
Those found in arms are ordered
to be immediately put to death

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.240
and the houses of those who abscond
are plundered and burned,

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.640
their cattle drove, their ploughs
and other tackle destroyed.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.360
<i>Lord George Sackville, Englishman,
third son of the Duke of Dorset.</i>

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.560
We have detachments
in all parts of the Highlands.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.480
The people are deservedly
in a most deplorable way

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.680
and must perish,
either by famine or by the sword.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.520
A just reward for traitors.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.720
We hang or shoot everyone that
is known to conceal the Pretender,

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.720
burn their houses, take their cattle.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.520
<i>The Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.960
<i>object of the largest single manhunt
in British history,</i>

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.600
<i>now disguised
as an ordinary clansman,</i>

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.000
<i>much addicted to the little bottle
he carries in his hip pocket,</i>

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.000
<i>suffering from dysentery,</i>

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.920
<i>is to spend the next five months</i>

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.000
<i>scrambling amidst the rocks and hills
of the Western Highlands,</i>

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.880
<i>sheltered by its people, who remain
loyal to him and never betray him,</i>

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.280
<i>until, in September, he takes a ship
for France and security,</i>

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.480
<i>leaving behind him nothing,</i>

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.680
<i>nothing but a legend,</i>

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.040
<i>"Bonnie Prince Charlie."</i>

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:32.600
<i>My bonnie moorhen
My bonnie moorhen.</i>

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.880
<i>Up in the grey hill
Down in the glen.</i>

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.440
<i>Charles Edward Stuart,
the “bonnie moorhen, “</i>

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.040
<i>is to walk out of the lives of the people
he has led into so much suffering</i>

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.640
<i>with scarcely a backward look
in their direction.</i>

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.560
<i>The year of the Prince had ended</i>

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.960
<i>but for the English Government,
this was just the beginning.</i>

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.840
<i>Systematically and with
clue parliamentary legislation,</i>

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.800
<i>they proceeded to eliminate ail
the things that made this man unique</i>

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.800
<i>and that gave him
the strength they so feared.</i>

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.880
<i>They penalized the wearing
of his Highland dress,</i>

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.080
<i>penalized the weaving
of his Highland tartan,</i>

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.520
<i>penalized the worshipping
at his Church,</i>

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.440
<i>penalized the carrying
of his weapons,</i>

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.800
<i>penalized the playing of his music.</i>

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.000
<i>They removed
the authority of his chief</i>

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.720
<i>and, in one blow, smashed forever
the system of his clan.</i>

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.960
<i>They then encouraged his chief
to lose interest in him,</i>

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.040
<i>to evict him and to replace him
by the more profitable sheep.</i>

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.680
<i>Thus they reduced him
to a homeless, unwanted oddity</i>

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.720
<i>and finally forced him,
in his hundreds of thousands,</i>

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.880
<i>to leave the land of his birth</i>

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.800
<i>for the canning industries
of the North,</i>

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.760
<i>for the disease-ridden slums
of the South,</i>

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.240
<i>for the lumber camps of Canada</i>

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.600
<i>and the stockyards of Australia.</i>

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.600
<i>And wherever he went,</i>

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.800
<i>he took with him
his music, his poetry,</i>

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.080
<i>his language and his children.</i>

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.880
<i>"On an April morning.</i>

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.240
<i>"I no longer hear birdsongs</i>

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.680
<i>"or the lowing of cattle on the moor.</i>

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.160
<i>"I hear the noise of sheep
and the English language,</i>

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.640
<i>"dogs barking
and frightening the deer.“".</i>

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.440
<i>Thus, within a century from Culloden,</i>

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.200
<i>the English
and the Scottish Lowlanders</i>

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.240
<i>had made secure forever</i>

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.960
<i>their religion, their commerce,</i>

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.880
<i>their culture, their ruling dynasty</i>

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.960
<i>and, in so doing,
had destroyed a race of people.</i>

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.480
<i>They have created a desert</i>

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.120
<i>and have called it "peace."</i>
