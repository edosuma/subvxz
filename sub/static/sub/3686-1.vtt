MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION

01:28.838 --> 01:31.674
- Hurry up!
- Min-su! Hurry!

01:31.674 --> 01:33.835
- Help me!
- Stupid!

01:34.110 --> 01:36.943
Hurry up, stupid!

01:38.248 --> 01:39.237
My bag!

01:43.286 --> 01:45.015
Min-su! Catch!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.387
Why me?

01:48.725 --> 01:49.692
Carry it!

01:51.728 --> 01:52.990
Brought everything?

01:53.129 --> 01:54.397
'Slam Dunk'!

01:54.397 --> 01:55.830
Give me that!

01:58.101 --> 01:59.693
Walkman!

02:00.870 --> 02:02.462
Hey!

02:02.639 --> 02:05.631
Why buy this,
when you know I'll take it!

02:05.875 --> 02:09.245
- Don't hit my head!
- I'll hit if I want!

02:09.245 --> 02:10.145
MIDDLE SCHOOL DIPLOMA

02:10.145 --> 02:13.673
I'm using it for today.
Okay?

02:13.750 --> 02:17.481
But I just got it.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.878
Why's the bus so late?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.547
Can we really skip graduation?

02:22.892 --> 02:26.988
If they find out we took those,
they'll freak!

02:27.430 --> 02:29.864
- The hell?
- Take yours.

02:29.966 --> 02:30.933
Here.

02:33.303 --> 02:35.271
Won't it be cold?

02:35.505 --> 02:37.666
Stupid!
We're not going up naked.

02:38.274 --> 02:40.970
- Look at him!
- Hurry up and take it!

02:41.377 --> 02:43.913
Make a sexy pose, man!

02:43.913 --> 02:44.902
That's it!

02:45.048 --> 02:47.744
- Take the pic!
- Ready?

02:50.286 --> 02:52.618
- Your turn!
- He fell for it!

02:55.024 --> 02:57.754
Come on!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.559
Walkman!

03:00.630 --> 03:01.756
What are you doing?

03:02.165 --> 03:05.362
- It's cold! Hurry!
- He used up all the batteries.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.528
Go stand.
Let's take the pic and go.

03:07.804 --> 03:09.101
Okay.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.699
Hurry up, fool!

03:13.509 --> 03:14.669
Stupid!

03:14.978 --> 03:15.808
There!

03:25.121 --> 03:26.247
What the hell?

03:28.024 --> 03:29.252
Is it broken?

03:29.559 --> 03:30.719
Hold on.

03:35.164 --> 03:36.392
Shit.

03:36.699 --> 03:37.631
Wait one sec.

03:38.234 --> 03:39.223
How should I pose?

03:39.802 --> 03:42.066
- Who cares!
- Stop hitting!

03:42.205 --> 03:43.297
Moron.

03:45.108 --> 03:46.006
Got it!

03:46.142 --> 03:47.734
- It's set!
- You sure?

03:48.745 --> 03:49.575
Hey!

03:50.546 --> 03:51.774
It's snowing.

04:09.899 --> 04:10.888
Min-su!

04:25.882 --> 04:26.871
In-chul.

04:27.216 --> 04:28.581
Let's stop for a bit.

04:30.019 --> 04:30.917
Min-su!

04:31.554 --> 04:33.112
Stupid fool.

04:42.832 --> 04:43.992
Damn it.

04:46.569 --> 04:47.593
Hyun-tae!

04:47.804 --> 04:48.736
See something?

04:52.141 --> 04:53.540
Let's put Min-su down to rest.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.275
Fuck! We're screwed!

05:07.690 --> 05:09.555
Why's it snowing so much?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.960
What's with your foot?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.265
Let's go down quickly.
Min-su could...

05:16.265 --> 05:20.463
You can't go anywhere!
Wanna get your foot cut off?

05:20.770 --> 05:23.762
Rest here with Min-su.
I'll take care of everything.

05:43.893 --> 05:45.019
In-chul?

06:14.190 --> 06:15.214
Min-su!

06:35.578 --> 06:36.636
Min-su...

06:38.614 --> 06:39.581
I'm sorry...

06:52.161 --> 06:52.991
Hyun-tae!

06:53.596 --> 06:54.563
Min-su!

06:56.632 --> 06:57.758
We found them!

07:02.138 --> 07:03.002
Hyun-tae!

07:03.539 --> 07:06.876
Hyun-tae! Min-su!
Are you okay?

07:06.876 --> 07:08.002
Hurry!

07:08.778 --> 07:09.938
Wake up!

07:11.280 --> 07:13.373
Min-su!

07:15.418 --> 07:16.442
Hyun-tae.

07:18.821 --> 07:20.982
Why didn't you stay there?

07:22.658 --> 07:24.592
Are you okay?

07:25.828 --> 07:29.025
Don't cry like a baby.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.224
It's all right.

07:40.243 --> 07:46.614
CONFESSION

07:52.855 --> 07:54.557
When your dad carried me...

07:54.557 --> 07:55.925
JI SUNG

07:55.925 --> 08:00.363
and ran down the mountain,
he suddenly fell.

08:00.363 --> 08:01.430
JOO JI-HOON

08:01.430 --> 08:06.669
So I got right up
and carried your dad down.

08:06.669 --> 08:08.004
LEE GWANG-SOO

08:08.004 --> 08:13.101
After running a while,
I found Uncle ln-chul fallen, too.

08:13.442 --> 08:17.879
So what did I do?
I carried them on each shoulder...

08:18.214 --> 08:23.519
ran down the mountain,
and straight to the hospital.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.316
written & directed by LEE DO-YUN

08:26.923 --> 08:27.912
I'm awesome, huh?

08:27.990 --> 08:30.083
Not again, Uncle Min-su.

08:30.193 --> 08:32.128
That's not
what Uncle ln-chul said.

08:32.128 --> 08:33.857
He's wrong!
In-chul, that bast...

08:34.096 --> 08:35.927
He's the one who's lying.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.190
You think I'm lying?

08:38.301 --> 08:39.164
Yes!

08:42.638 --> 08:44.373
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

08:44.373 --> 08:46.238
Tickle! Tickle!
I got you!

08:52.648 --> 08:54.240
- Mom says to come out.
- Okay.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.747
Airplane!
Let's fly out!

08:58.988 --> 09:01.320
Happy birthday Yuri!
Kiss!

09:02.758 --> 09:04.988
All your favorite food is here!

09:05.528 --> 09:06.324
Sit here.

09:06.429 --> 09:07.623
Happy birthday Yuri!

09:08.998 --> 09:10.295
Happy birthday!

09:14.070 --> 09:15.594
Where's Uncle ln-chul?

09:22.778 --> 09:23.676
Mother!

09:24.146 --> 09:25.477
Ow! My back!

09:28.951 --> 09:30.077
Let go!

09:34.223 --> 09:38.284
You never know
what can go wrong in life.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.195
It scares me every time
I go to your arcade.

09:42.465 --> 09:45.868
It's packed with people
smoking like crazy.

09:45.868 --> 09:47.597
Okay, I get it.

09:48.271 --> 09:53.106
Bring the insurance papers
and stop by tomorrow morning.

09:53.376 --> 09:54.365
Tomorrow?

09:54.810 --> 09:56.471
- Yes, ma'am!
- Wait.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.514
It's my new number.

10:01.217 --> 10:03.777
I already know
why give me this...

10:05.488 --> 10:06.546
Oh, right.

10:07.123 --> 10:08.818
- Bye son.
- Take care!

10:09.725 --> 10:10.851
Have a great day!

10:12.828 --> 10:13.763
Yuri?

10:13.763 --> 10:15.890
I'll scold Uncle ln-chul
when he comes.

10:16.032 --> 10:16.930
Let's eat.

10:17.833 --> 10:18.697
He's here!

10:19.302 --> 10:20.564
Uncle ln-chul's here.

10:21.470 --> 10:23.700
- Why you...
- Fool!

10:23.906 --> 10:25.237
Move!

10:25.308 --> 10:26.375
Daddy's here!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.969
- A bicycle!
- Yuri!

10:29.945 --> 10:31.037
Lucky you!

10:31.147 --> 10:34.317
The best bike there is!
Nice, huh?

10:34.317 --> 10:36.615
- Hi, Yuri!
- Thank you!

10:38.321 --> 10:39.618
Careful!

10:41.824 --> 10:43.985
Always so thoughtful...

10:47.863 --> 10:49.194
I finished all the food
from last time.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.568
She says to eat it with rice
not beer.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.600
I only drink a bit
to ease the food down.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.775
Instead of water.

11:00.109 --> 11:01.406
He says he doesn't drink.

11:04.213 --> 11:05.475
Just a bit instead of water.

11:06.849 --> 11:09.385
Yeah right!
Stop drinking, pal!

11:09.385 --> 11:12.081
I'm beat! Let's rest.

11:21.464 --> 11:24.661
What's this?
A four-leaf clover?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.529
Did you make this?

11:26.602 --> 11:31.437
You never take food Uncle ln-chul,
so take that.

11:31.907 --> 11:36.276
I got lots of money
to buy my own food.

11:36.379 --> 11:40.042
Only bums like Min-su
take food home.

11:40.383 --> 11:41.984
Don't play with kids like that.

11:41.984 --> 11:42.916
Hey!

11:43.919 --> 11:44.851
What's that?

11:45.054 --> 11:46.646
None of your business!

11:46.956 --> 11:47.980
What about mine, Yuri?

11:48.090 --> 11:51.116
I'll make yours next time,
Uncle Min-su.

11:51.994 --> 11:55.122
Yuri! Come here you!

11:56.098 --> 11:57.360
Let's run away!

11:57.666 --> 11:59.725
Come back here!

12:09.912 --> 12:11.004
Go! Go!

12:14.817 --> 12:22.815
In the thick smoke
all dressed up

12:22.958 --> 12:27.327
I am lost
in the passing time

12:31.934 --> 12:35.271
- Bastards!
- You butted in!

12:35.271 --> 12:36.572
Bastard!

12:36.572 --> 12:37.470
Come here you!

12:40.142 --> 12:41.939
Damn young bastards!

12:42.411 --> 12:48.350
- Why live getting beat up?
- We won. Don't worry.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.342
- You deserved it.
- It's okay. Go to sleep.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.383
Every time he gets drunk!
Stupid fool.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.459
- Let's go.
- Why live?

13:02.031 --> 13:02.895
Look.

13:02.998 --> 13:04.966
The fool's sleeping sitting up.

13:05.601 --> 13:08.229
- Lie down Min-su.
- Go!

13:18.681 --> 13:22.242
I took your parents
to the hospital today.

13:22.685 --> 13:24.118
Dad can walk now.

13:24.787 --> 13:27.051
- I'm drunk. Let's go.
- Hey!

13:28.657 --> 13:31.854
Be good, bastard.

13:32.294 --> 13:34.854
Mother got a new number.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.693
Why must I deliver
your mom's number to you?

13:42.171 --> 13:43.138
I'm no slave.

13:43.739 --> 13:49.075
If I were you, I'd be nice
to my rich parents and live it up!

13:49.512 --> 13:50.911
How are your parents?

13:51.647 --> 13:53.080
Do you call them often?

13:53.315 --> 13:56.512
Why call the old bags
who left hating Korea?

13:56.752 --> 13:59.585
Come on. Be good!

14:00.055 --> 14:00.714
Wait.

14:00.823 --> 14:04.315
Your mom said
to give you this, too.

14:05.794 --> 14:07.125
Screw you!

14:07.796 --> 14:08.626
See ya.

14:10.065 --> 14:10.759
Hey!

14:12.101 --> 14:13.068
I'll give you a ride.

14:14.837 --> 14:17.305
- No thanks!
- Watch it!

14:17.806 --> 14:22.709
Damn firefighter
with no sense of civic duty.

14:23.045 --> 14:23.909
See ya!

14:37.226 --> 14:39.562
Hell! You scared me!

14:39.562 --> 14:40.494
You're home?

14:40.829 --> 14:42.456
Shit.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.693
I told you not to come
when I'm not here.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.306
I came to get away from
some stupid bastard.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.796
Whatever!

14:52.341 --> 14:54.070
Don't smoke in there!

14:54.944 --> 14:57.276
Just close the door.

15:05.387 --> 15:06.649
Why come home so late?

15:07.089 --> 15:08.386
I was working.

15:08.958 --> 15:13.986
Why don't you clean up
the damn mess around here?

15:14.296 --> 15:16.457
I'll do it later
when I feel like it.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.802
When you clean...

15:19.802 --> 15:24.501
don't touch important files
and throw 'em out!

15:24.607 --> 15:28.168
Okay! I said I'll clean.

15:29.478 --> 15:31.173
The homeowner came by.

15:33.082 --> 15:35.676
He yelled like hell
for not paying rent.

15:36.585 --> 15:37.677
Shit!

15:39.922 --> 15:42.891
Stupid!
You opened the door again?

15:43.359 --> 15:46.624
Just move to a cheap place
around our shop.

15:47.429 --> 15:51.456
Crazy? I can't live in hell holes
like that!

15:52.368 --> 15:53.392
Shit.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.298
Wanna do it?

16:05.881 --> 16:07.849
- Bring the cutter!
- Okay!

16:07.983 --> 16:09.507
Get the injured out!

16:09.652 --> 16:12.348
Slowly! That's it!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.428
What happened last night?

16:23.165 --> 16:26.464
I feel like
a beat up punch bag.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.034
It's cuz you get drunk
and sleep sitting up.

16:30.906 --> 16:31.804
Aren't you late?

16:31.940 --> 16:35.000
Who cares if I'm late?
What can they do?

16:35.411 --> 16:38.437
Hurry up
and stay out of trouble.

16:39.048 --> 16:41.608
I need a drink
for my hangover.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.475
Take care!

17:21.990 --> 17:23.719
VICTORY ARCADE

17:30.899 --> 17:31.888
Welcome, sir!

17:35.471 --> 17:36.369
Hello, sir.

17:37.606 --> 17:39.130
- Is she in?
- One moment.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.975
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

17:59.261 --> 18:00.193
She says to come in.

18:18.580 --> 18:22.072
I'll see myself out.
Take care.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.152
- Mother!
- You came?

18:32.427 --> 18:36.488
Mother, you look even younger
than yesterday!

18:36.632 --> 18:37.724
Why you.

18:40.502 --> 18:42.993
I met Hyun-tae last night.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.173
Don't bring up that jerk.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.967
Come on, Mother.

18:47.309 --> 18:50.710
Still Hyun-tae talks about
you two a lot.

18:50.913 --> 18:56.715
Then, why go against us
and live a stupid life like that?

18:57.052 --> 19:01.045
Marrying that damn
orphan bitch.

19:01.523 --> 19:03.150
Let's see it.

19:04.126 --> 19:07.289
- This is totally perfect.
- Let's see.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.432
Read it through.
I made this especially for you.

19:10.432 --> 19:14.095
Whatever!
How much if this place burns?

19:14.503 --> 19:15.868
1 0 million!

19:17.940 --> 19:19.908
Fill it out.
I'll sign.

19:20.876 --> 19:23.208
Here. Smoke one.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.705
Thanks.

19:25.714 --> 19:26.681
Here.

19:27.916 --> 19:31.545
Will this deal
pay for your bills this month?

19:31.653 --> 19:33.848
Not even close.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.648
How about you?

19:36.091 --> 19:39.151
Business seems
a bit slow today.

19:39.995 --> 19:43.021
I can't do this gig
for long either.

19:43.532 --> 19:44.624
Damn.

19:46.301 --> 19:48.235
Business isn't as good.

19:49.404 --> 19:51.372
With Hyun-tae's father sick...

19:52.808 --> 19:59.714
damn bastards hound me
for money left and right.

20:03.886 --> 20:08.482
At midnight this Sunday
after closing...

20:09.491 --> 20:12.153
I have a big payment to make.

20:13.462 --> 20:19.458
It'd be great if someone
comes then and burns this!

20:19.568 --> 20:21.934
So I can retire
on the insurance.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.704
No matter how hard I try
to run it alone...

20:25.841 --> 20:31.609
Why'd I put surveillance cams
all over here? So stupid.

20:32.347 --> 20:33.837
On the contrary...

20:34.182 --> 20:38.175
with evidence on the cams,
it'd be easy to get a settlement.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.016
Really?

20:45.727 --> 20:50.187
Oh! I wish I could live
comfortably.

20:51.199 --> 20:54.191
Who can help me?

21:08.417 --> 21:11.386
How about a game?

21:12.254 --> 21:16.088
Number 52 is looking good.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.056
Congratulations, sir!

21:25.901 --> 21:27.801
FAKE PATIENT 17

21:28.270 --> 21:33.230
I just went out for
chicken and beer.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.772
Why didn't you go
in the wheelchair!

21:39.948 --> 21:41.848
Shit.

21:41.950 --> 21:43.850
Was the chicken good?

21:46.254 --> 21:49.951
The patient went
to replenish nutrition.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.582
What's so wrong with that?

21:51.660 --> 21:57.530
A patient with a broken leg
went out without even crutches.

21:57.966 --> 21:59.934
That's not normal.

22:03.338 --> 22:04.669
Chief SHlN?

22:06.108 --> 22:08.770
When will you get off my back?

22:10.779 --> 22:13.509
To all the 6 fake patients
in this room...

22:13.849 --> 22:17.615
You'll no longer receive
recovery payments.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.619
Disciplinary will call you.

22:21.823 --> 22:22.915
Take care.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.129
The fuck...

22:39.608 --> 22:41.075
Get up!

22:52.821 --> 22:54.186
Why'd you drink so much?

22:55.590 --> 22:56.682
What's wrong?

23:01.963 --> 23:03.021
Min-su?

23:04.099 --> 23:05.157
What?

23:06.735 --> 23:08.202
Aren't you getting married?

23:08.870 --> 23:10.565
Your dick will rot.

23:10.939 --> 23:13.100
Bastard! What the hell?

23:14.109 --> 23:15.542
It's not cuz I don't want to.

23:16.278 --> 23:18.109
How can I with no girl?

23:18.747 --> 23:20.078
Min-su?

23:20.348 --> 23:21.713
What's with you today?

23:23.318 --> 23:25.377
About Hyun-tae's mom's arcade...

23:28.123 --> 23:29.852
I met with her today.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.892
Is she doing well?

23:34.629 --> 23:35.823
The arcade...

23:39.501 --> 23:40.763
Let's rob it for her.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.303
What?

23:43.405 --> 23:46.169
She asked me to do it.

23:46.541 --> 23:47.565
Think about it.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.701
Hyun-tae's dad got sick.

23:49.811 --> 23:53.679
But she's too busy
to take care of him.

23:53.815 --> 23:56.885
And you know
Hyun-tae's uptight.

23:56.885 --> 24:00.946
As long as she runs it,
he'll never go see her.

24:01.089 --> 24:04.923
They're family!
How sad is that?

24:09.231 --> 24:11.358
If we help her this once...

24:11.733 --> 24:13.701
know what the best part is?

24:15.470 --> 24:20.237
No one loses, pal!

24:20.942 --> 24:25.174
She can retire on the insurance
and make up with Hyun-tae.

24:25.614 --> 24:29.573
And you'll get a cut
to get married and shit!

24:29.684 --> 24:30.810
Huh, Min-su?

24:31.253 --> 24:34.984
Isn't it great?

24:41.229 --> 24:44.289
I'm going to bed.
Come in to sleep or go.

24:44.666 --> 24:47.931
Sit down! You fool!

24:49.871 --> 24:51.805
How long will you live
like this?

24:52.240 --> 24:56.142
How long do I have to
take care of you?

24:56.511 --> 24:57.671
Please don't.

24:58.613 --> 25:01.480
The hell! You fool...

25:02.817 --> 25:05.718
Please don't what!

25:06.821 --> 25:12.418
Who're you to stop everyone
from being happy!

25:14.529 --> 25:15.518
Just don't.

25:19.968 --> 25:21.492
Let's sleep.
We gotta head out early.

25:32.147 --> 25:34.843
Damn! Selfish loser.

26:07.916 --> 26:08.905
Who is it?

26:12.153 --> 26:13.279
In-chul's car is here.

26:15.390 --> 26:18.450
- He slept over?
- Yup.

26:18.860 --> 26:19.884
Did you drink?

26:20.729 --> 26:22.856
Told you not to eat it
with drinks!

26:26.968 --> 26:28.162
MUTE
No luck?

26:28.637 --> 26:29.661
It won't come off.

26:30.138 --> 26:32.663
I have leftover detergents,
but it'll ruin it.

26:33.808 --> 26:36.278
I don't know why
they're at it again.

26:36.278 --> 26:40.305
It's not Yuri's fault
Mi-lan is like that.

26:40.448 --> 26:42.143
It's not contagious!

26:44.452 --> 26:46.477
Why'd ln-chul come?
Is something wrong?

26:47.722 --> 26:52.022
Something happened
at a delivery place.

26:52.394 --> 26:53.588
But ln-chul took care of it.

26:54.996 --> 26:58.397
In-chul seems to do
quite a lot for you.

26:58.533 --> 27:02.804
Like hell!
It's what friends do.

27:02.804 --> 27:06.262
- What friends?
- Don't hit him!

27:07.842 --> 27:08.934
You came?

27:09.411 --> 27:10.070
Aren't you cold?

27:10.345 --> 27:13.314
Dang! It's cold!

27:14.282 --> 27:15.112
Give me that.

27:19.020 --> 27:24.219
Damn young fools
who don't know any better!

27:25.393 --> 27:26.451
Throw it out!

27:27.162 --> 27:28.424
I'll buy her a new one.

27:29.531 --> 27:30.657
It's the 29th, right?

27:32.033 --> 27:33.159
What?

27:33.635 --> 27:35.535
Your parents' anniversary
of passing.

27:36.971 --> 27:38.996
Oh, right.

27:39.774 --> 27:42.800
You son of a bitch.

27:44.412 --> 27:48.644
Be good to your parents
like everyone else.

27:49.050 --> 27:51.883
Why don't you? Stupid.

27:52.821 --> 27:55.449
I want to be good to them
and live normally.

27:56.524 --> 27:58.492
But they don't live like that.

27:59.127 --> 28:00.492
Exactly!

28:02.097 --> 28:05.863
If they lived normally,
Hyun-tae would be happy!

28:05.967 --> 28:06.956
Right?

28:07.202 --> 28:08.134
The hell.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.602
I gotta go.

28:10.872 --> 28:12.203
I'll come that day.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.208
- Throw that out.
- Okay.

28:16.211 --> 28:17.109
Take care!

28:17.912 --> 28:18.844
Bye.

28:22.817 --> 28:23.784
What?

28:23.985 --> 28:27.978
What? What? What?

28:30.191 --> 28:31.180
Let's eat.

28:32.193 --> 28:33.285
Come in. I'll cook.

28:47.409 --> 28:49.741
FIRE INSURANCE APPLICATION

28:52.113 --> 28:53.910
MESSAGE FROM MIN-SU

29:02.223 --> 29:03.658
Son of a bitch.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.491

29:06.761 --> 29:09.229
11:26 PM
NOVEMBER 24th, 2013

CLOUDY WITH 90% CHANCE OF RAIN

29:16.571 --> 29:19.563
HOW ARE YOU? I'LL COME BY SOON

29:30.485 --> 29:31.850

30:23.271 --> 30:24.863
You drank?

30:25.039 --> 30:26.199
Not much.

30:26.307 --> 30:28.935
Yeah right!
You bastard!

30:29.010 --> 30:30.375
Let's just do it.

30:30.478 --> 30:34.847
This is dang important!
Listen carefully!

30:34.983 --> 30:38.441
Smash up machines
then pour gas all over. Got it?

30:38.586 --> 30:40.355
I'll handle things
with Mother.

30:40.355 --> 30:41.413
- Okay.
- Get ready.

30:55.970 --> 30:56.800
Let's go.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.074
Oh no!

31:36.344 --> 31:38.938
Shit! Come out!

31:40.748 --> 31:42.545
They can't hear us.

31:43.685 --> 31:45.053
- Really?
- Yes!

31:45.053 --> 31:45.853
What now?

31:45.853 --> 31:48.022
Drag me over and hit me.

31:48.022 --> 31:48.790
Hit you?

31:48.790 --> 31:50.451
Yes!
So they won't suspect it!

31:50.558 --> 31:51.889
Shit. Okay!

31:53.394 --> 31:54.622
Good!

31:54.696 --> 31:56.391
In front of the cam.
Good!

31:58.633 --> 32:01.101
Ready?
One, two, three!

32:03.237 --> 32:03.972
Ouch!

32:03.972 --> 32:06.532
- Now what?
- The safe!

32:06.641 --> 32:08.810
- Open it?
- Yes! Take my finger!

32:08.810 --> 32:10.835
Okay! Let's go!

32:11.980 --> 32:15.313
- Why'd you hit so hard!
- Sorry, Mother.

32:16.784 --> 32:18.453
Now push me.

32:18.453 --> 32:19.477
- Now?
- Yes!

32:20.588 --> 32:22.249
Good.

32:22.590 --> 32:23.591
- Hey!
- Yes?

32:23.591 --> 32:26.321
- Take the money and go.
- Okay.

32:26.427 --> 32:30.227
Light up a far corner and leave.

32:35.903 --> 32:38.667
Leave the ledger there.

32:39.307 --> 32:44.779
Get it all in!
Hurry up!

32:44.779 --> 32:47.304
Hold on!
I'm doing it!

32:48.516 --> 32:51.883
- It hurts, you fool...
- It does? Sorry.

33:18.913 --> 33:19.902
Min-su!

33:20.548 --> 33:21.572
You done?

33:22.750 --> 33:24.217
Why isn't he answering?

33:27.188 --> 33:28.456
- What's wrong?
- Hey!

33:28.456 --> 33:29.650
Where are you going?

33:30.091 --> 33:31.080
I'll be right back.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.352
Hey!

33:36.597 --> 33:39.794
What are you doing?

33:42.370 --> 33:43.598
What's that?

33:46.140 --> 33:47.334
What?

33:48.810 --> 33:49.868
Father!

33:50.845 --> 33:53.336
Oh no!

34:04.859 --> 34:05.757
Hey!

34:05.860 --> 34:06.918
The camera!

34:09.630 --> 34:11.860
Stupid!

34:13.467 --> 34:16.562
What's wrong?

34:25.379 --> 34:27.813
Mother...

34:35.857 --> 34:37.051
Wait...

34:37.257 --> 34:39.283
- Mother...
- Honey!

34:42.063 --> 34:43.893
What are you doing!

34:44.398 --> 34:45.989
Call 91 1!

34:49.270 --> 34:51.534
Call 91 1 you bastards!

34:52.806 --> 34:53.831
Honey!

34:56.444 --> 34:58.412
- Mother...
- Wait!

35:01.816 --> 35:04.284
Mother... I can explain.

35:53.835 --> 35:56.827
Listen to me! Mother!

35:58.272 --> 36:00.433
Mother! Wait!

36:00.908 --> 36:01.806
Mother!

36:02.176 --> 36:03.108
Mother!

36:03.644 --> 36:05.202
What?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.581
There's a door!

36:10.918 --> 36:12.112
Help me!

36:14.856 --> 36:15.914
Move!

36:22.196 --> 36:23.754
- Mother!
- Mother!

36:24.031 --> 36:26.556
Get down!
It's dangerous!

36:26.701 --> 36:29.067
Help me!

36:29.403 --> 36:31.701
Mother!

36:32.406 --> 36:36.137
- It's dangerous!
- Bastards!

36:36.277 --> 36:38.074
Mother! Be careful!

36:38.212 --> 36:40.180
Son of a bitch!

36:40.948 --> 36:42.074
Help me!

36:42.683 --> 36:44.452
- Thieves!
- I can explain!

36:44.452 --> 36:46.579
Thieves! Help me!

36:47.688 --> 36:48.484
Thieves!

36:48.589 --> 36:50.989
Help me!

36:51.359 --> 36:52.485
Thieves!

36:52.960 --> 36:55.121
Help me!

37:09.210 --> 37:10.734
You bastard.

37:20.421 --> 37:21.410
Mother?

37:22.657 --> 37:24.022
Mother?

37:24.926 --> 37:25.824
Mother...

37:26.394 --> 37:27.094
Mother?

37:27.094 --> 37:28.755
Mother!

37:30.831 --> 37:32.526
What the hell...

37:33.768 --> 37:37.568
Mother? Oh no...

37:38.873 --> 37:40.135
Oh no...

37:40.608 --> 37:42.303
How did this happen?

37:43.511 --> 37:45.376
Mother...

37:45.880 --> 37:48.144
What do we do?

37:48.649 --> 37:49.741
What do we do?

37:49.951 --> 37:53.250
Hey! Wait!

38:03.030 --> 38:04.463
Fuck!

39:19.640 --> 39:20.629
What's this?

40:47.161 --> 40:48.458
What's the address?

40:48.562 --> 40:51.360
A basement arcade
at Dal-san 6-1.

40:51.832 --> 40:52.821
Where?

41:13.287 --> 41:14.515
Take the mask off.

41:20.327 --> 41:24.388
What the fuck!
I didn't plan for that!

41:24.765 --> 41:27.598
Bastard!
Take it off!

41:28.669 --> 41:29.966
Son of a bitch!

41:36.110 --> 41:37.202
Go to bed.

41:37.945 --> 41:39.037
I'll come tomorrow.

42:14.815 --> 42:16.442
That son of a bitch!

42:19.320 --> 42:21.117
Hey!

42:23.824 --> 42:25.985
You bastard!

42:28.362 --> 42:29.454
Stupid!

42:29.763 --> 42:35.292
It's not my fault!
What did I do wrong!

42:36.804 --> 42:39.398
What the hell did I do!

42:40.541 --> 42:42.702
You son of a bitch!

42:42.843 --> 42:46.540
It's not my fault!

42:49.149 --> 42:50.081
Stupid!

42:51.585 --> 42:52.643
Bastard!

43:37.598 --> 43:41.694
FUNERAL HOME

44:33.320 --> 44:34.344
Uncle...

45:01.315 --> 45:04.807
Min-su's pretty shaken up.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.505
Think it's in there?

46:02.543 --> 46:04.773
It has to be
or else we're screwed.

46:07.448 --> 46:10.975
Move it along!
Don't take all day!

46:12.219 --> 46:13.208
Damn it.

46:15.656 --> 46:16.645
Sir?

46:23.797 --> 46:26.527
Working hard?
How've you been?

46:27.134 --> 46:28.624
You're on this case?

46:28.969 --> 46:31.995
Help me out,
Detective CHOl.

46:37.544 --> 46:39.774
It's still not opened?

46:41.381 --> 46:44.839
What's taking so damn long?

46:45.486 --> 46:46.783
What the hell!

46:47.721 --> 46:48.779
Shit.

46:50.491 --> 46:51.549
What?

46:51.758 --> 46:52.918
You're on this?

46:53.260 --> 46:56.423
The Chief of Police is here?

46:57.865 --> 47:00.527
I'll come by the station soon.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.229
Take care.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.510
Mrs. LlM's son,
Hyun-tae, is the culprit.

47:15.415 --> 47:19.613
You know JUNG ln-chul
who's under disciplinary?

47:19.820 --> 47:20.854
They're inseparable friends.

47:20.854 --> 47:21.855
CLOSE FRIENDS

47:21.855 --> 47:24.221
A hefty fire insurance
on Victory Arcade...

47:24.358 --> 47:28.260
was signed by JUNG
and Mrs. LlM 5 days before.

47:28.595 --> 47:31.928
Then, it's so obvious.

47:32.165 --> 47:33.632
What do the cops say?

47:33.901 --> 47:36.199
The Chief of Police
was at the scene.

47:37.538 --> 47:39.335
Cooperative investigation
is out.

47:39.806 --> 47:43.343
First, find out if JUNG and LlM
had alibis that night.

47:43.343 --> 47:43.934
Yes, sir.

47:44.044 --> 47:47.114
One of the surveillance cams
can be restored, sir.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.342
- Really?
- Yes.

47:48.448 --> 47:51.008
- See if there's anything on it.
- Yes, sir.

47:59.993 --> 48:00.721
Come with me!

48:02.062 --> 48:03.529
- Honey!
- Let's go!

48:04.898 --> 48:05.956
Hey!

48:09.369 --> 48:11.872
The hell?
I didn't even wash up.

48:11.872 --> 48:13.430
What'd you do on the 24th?

48:15.342 --> 48:17.139
The 24th?

48:17.277 --> 48:20.610
Sunday!
Were you working that night?

48:21.848 --> 48:23.611
I don't remember.

48:23.951 --> 48:29.048
Shit! It was 4 days ago!
Why can't you remember!

48:29.156 --> 48:32.216
I can't even remember
what I did yesterday.

48:32.559 --> 48:34.459
Then, you were with me
that night.

48:34.761 --> 48:37.195
If anyone asks,
tell them that! Got it?

48:37.497 --> 48:39.590
Was l? Okay.

48:40.867 --> 48:42.536
But who'll ask me?

48:42.536 --> 48:43.867
Fuck!

48:43.937 --> 48:45.739
Just do as I say!

48:45.739 --> 48:47.604
Why are you yelling!

48:47.841 --> 48:49.240
Fine!

48:50.410 --> 48:54.073
What's with your face?
Are you sick?

48:54.181 --> 48:55.739
Shit!

48:57.351 --> 49:00.081
Let's go home.
I'll make chicken soup.

49:00.287 --> 49:03.120
Fuck that! Get off!

49:03.223 --> 49:04.958
- Get off?
- Yeah!

49:04.958 --> 49:06.357
- Get off!
- Hey!

49:06.460 --> 49:07.358
Honey!

49:08.261 --> 49:09.489
- Shit!
- Hey!

49:28.482 --> 49:29.847
What are you doing?

49:31.852 --> 49:33.581
What the hell!

49:33.920 --> 49:34.887
I'm going to Seoul.

49:36.423 --> 49:37.720
The hell...

49:40.127 --> 49:46.099
If you disappear now,
you'll look most suspicious!

49:46.099 --> 49:47.396
Who cares!

49:49.503 --> 49:50.697
Fuck.

49:51.972 --> 49:53.564
Come here and listen to me.

49:55.108 --> 49:56.803
Come here now!

49:58.111 --> 49:59.043
What!

50:03.250 --> 50:08.017
I'm not listening to you!

50:11.391 --> 50:16.351
Fuck!
Look what it got me!

50:19.132 --> 50:20.360
Fine.

50:21.501 --> 50:23.059
We'll go to Seoul.

50:23.170 --> 50:26.196
Screw you, bastard!

50:28.775 --> 50:30.174
Shit.

50:35.716 --> 50:37.616
Didn't your mother mention me?

50:38.518 --> 50:39.610
Look.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.818
I have shares in the arcade.

50:43.824 --> 50:45.849
So, I looked into things.

50:46.493 --> 50:49.053
Things are pretty bad.

50:51.598 --> 50:58.470
Your mother paid bribes
to cops and prosecutors.

50:58.839 --> 51:02.366
But her ledger went missing.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.639
- So?
- Well...

51:07.681 --> 51:09.478
What I'm saying is...

51:11.218 --> 51:15.484
the police won't look for
the culprit.

51:18.492 --> 51:22.189
But then that puts me
in a rough spot.

51:34.107 --> 51:35.665
It's an lOU.

51:39.212 --> 51:43.581
Your mother borrowed
big money from me.

51:47.554 --> 51:49.249
What do you want from me?

51:49.656 --> 51:52.523
The culprit has to be caught.

51:52.859 --> 51:56.454
Then, you'll get
the insurance settlement.

51:57.330 --> 52:00.322
Then, you can pay me back.

52:07.207 --> 52:10.608
- I'll see you in court later.
- Wait!

52:12.379 --> 52:14.313
Sit down, please.

52:14.781 --> 52:17.350
No need to get excited.

52:17.350 --> 52:20.877
We can work it out
between us.

52:21.021 --> 52:22.750
Fine.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.118
I'll look into it
and see you later.

52:31.698 --> 52:33.063
Aren't you mad?

52:33.767 --> 52:37.760
Don't you want to catch
who did this to your parents?

52:38.805 --> 52:40.864
How can a son not want to?

52:46.847 --> 52:48.246
Did I push him too hard?

52:49.783 --> 52:50.977
You think?

52:59.593 --> 53:00.787
Mr. LlM Hyun-tae?

53:08.001 --> 53:10.561
Special investigations
from Life lnsurance Company.

53:10.770 --> 53:14.331
LIFE INSURANCE CO.
SHIN YI-SU

53:14.474 --> 53:15.736
Why are you here?

53:16.042 --> 53:17.873
Just stopped by.

53:18.745 --> 53:20.679
Do you have time to chat?

53:27.988 --> 53:29.080
I'm listening.

53:31.124 --> 53:32.989
I'll say it straight out.

53:33.793 --> 53:35.658
We're postponing
the insurance payment.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.695
From our standpoint...

53:38.431 --> 53:40.456
we need the police reports...

53:40.567 --> 53:44.560
to see if the payment
should be made or not.

53:45.105 --> 53:48.666
But there's no progress
in the investigation.

53:48.808 --> 53:52.904
And personally,
I don't think it was an accident.

53:54.814 --> 53:56.679
That's all you came to say?

53:57.183 --> 53:59.617
Insurance settlement worth...

53:59.786 --> 54:01.048
$20 million.

54:01.521 --> 54:04.615
I thought, who'd benefit
the most from this case.

54:04.958 --> 54:09.361
Obviously you came to mind.

54:10.130 --> 54:11.563
Someone died.

54:13.633 --> 54:15.464
My mom died!

54:17.570 --> 54:21.028
Why's everyone
just talking about money?

54:21.908 --> 54:25.776
Isn't there anything else
to talk about besides money?

54:31.885 --> 54:33.284
Just go.

55:46.326 --> 55:49.227
HYUN-TAE

56:20.093 --> 56:21.253
Hi, Hyun-tae.

56:36.943 --> 56:38.342
That's enough.

56:38.611 --> 56:40.340
You've been through a lot.

56:40.980 --> 56:42.413
Still, we should do this.

56:43.249 --> 56:44.876
Min-su, bow to your parents.

56:53.059 --> 56:54.287
A few years back...

56:57.664 --> 57:03.762
Someone snuck in and took Yuri
while Mi-lan wasn't watching.

57:05.305 --> 57:06.863
I asked around.

57:07.941 --> 57:12.139
A neighbor said she saw
someone take Yuri off in a car.

57:15.281 --> 57:17.545
From her description,
I realized it was Mom.

57:18.985 --> 57:21.545
So, Mi-lan and I went
to her house.

57:23.957 --> 57:27.256
Mom was blankly watching
Yuri on a table.

57:27.594 --> 57:28.959
Yuri was crying like hell.

57:30.029 --> 57:32.156
So, I yelled
'What are you doing'!

57:32.999 --> 57:35.160
But she said she didn't know.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.340
Dad fell ill
a few days before that.

57:45.745 --> 57:47.178
She must've been scared.

57:49.716 --> 57:54.983
With Yuri gone, she thought
I'd leave Mi-lan and come home.

57:58.958 --> 57:59.982
In-chul.

58:01.861 --> 58:02.953
Min-su.

58:04.497 --> 58:05.464
Yeah?

58:05.765 --> 58:08.495
I gotta catch the culprits.

58:12.805 --> 58:16.536
What are you saying?

58:17.644 --> 58:18.975
She's my mom.

58:20.346 --> 58:23.213
She didn't know to live better,
but she's my mom.

58:24.851 --> 58:27.687
No one's trying to find
her killer.

58:27.687 --> 58:29.245
When my mom died!

58:35.828 --> 58:37.159
Hyun-tae...

58:39.165 --> 58:41.895
Calm down, man.

58:43.036 --> 58:46.528
What can you do, pal?

58:48.041 --> 58:49.702
I'll catch the bastards.

58:50.977 --> 58:53.138
And make sure they pay.

58:53.713 --> 58:55.146
It's only right.

58:57.450 --> 58:58.849
Min-su? In-chul?

59:01.054 --> 59:02.612
Help me, pals.

59:05.458 --> 59:07.983
PAYMENT POSTPONED
FOR LIM HYUN-TAE

59:11.831 --> 59:14.459
- Fuck.
- Chief?

59:15.034 --> 59:16.092
What?

59:16.436 --> 59:17.926
Someone's here for you.

59:25.645 --> 59:26.839
Confess?

59:29.015 --> 59:30.414
If you can't...

59:31.918 --> 59:33.476
I'll say I did it alone.

59:38.825 --> 59:39.917
In-chul...

59:40.226 --> 59:42.854
Think about what will happen
if you confess.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.026
Min-su.

59:48.434 --> 59:50.925
If we confess now...

59:51.337 --> 59:54.795
Hyun-tae will find out
everything!

59:55.375 --> 59:57.036
Are you okay with that?

59:57.443 --> 59:58.535
Huh?

59:59.912 --> 01:00:02.005
It's killing me, too.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:05.916
But think about it.

01:00:07.053 --> 01:00:09.715
If we go weak now...

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:12.419
it won't be just you and me.

01:00:12.558 --> 01:00:15.925
We'll drag Hyun-tae
down to hell, too!

01:00:16.796 --> 01:00:18.661
What about Mi-lan and Yuri?

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:23.595
He wants to catch the culprits,
not find out we did it!

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:28.332
Min-su...

01:00:30.009 --> 01:00:31.476
Let's not go weak.

01:00:31.978 --> 01:00:32.967
Okay?

01:00:41.988 --> 01:00:43.751
Who's that bastard?

01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:46.155
Let's go eat.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:50.820
Shit!

01:00:51.631 --> 01:00:52.825
Go home for now.

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:54.761
Why?

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.732
Just go! Hurry!

01:00:57.136 --> 01:00:57.932
I'll call you.

01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:04.109
Min-su!

01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:08.006
Got it?

01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:13.216
Shit.

01:01:21.961 --> 01:01:23.861
Damn old jerk.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.097
What are you doing?

01:01:29.969 --> 01:01:32.062
You're behind
Victory Arcade, aren't you?

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:35.536
Why are your cases
always so suspicious?

01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:38.470
What the fuck!

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.810
What are you trying to say?

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.505
Just frustrated that's all.

01:01:43.015 --> 01:01:45.483
I think it's an inside job.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.247
If you're gonna talk nonsense,
I'm leaving.

01:01:51.891 --> 01:01:54.257
One of the surveillance cams
was restored.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.323
Wonder what's on it.

01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:01.956
But it's useless shit
cuz cops won't investigate.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.064
Know why?

01:02:04.904 --> 01:02:06.371
I don't care!

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:08.967
Get out of the way.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:19.179
Move!

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:20.850
Get out!

01:02:23.956 --> 01:02:25.423
Her ledger is missing.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:29.921
The record of all her bribes
to the cops!

01:02:30.229 --> 01:02:31.560
I wonder who has it.

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:33.365
Probably the culprit.

01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:53.348
The weirdest thing was...

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.549
the door was open.

01:02:56.088 --> 01:02:58.579
How'd they know
to come then?

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.819
Everyone knows
we're closed on Sundays.

01:03:02.261 --> 01:03:06.391
But payday always changes.
We don't even know.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.329
Notice anyone suspicious
come before then?

01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:14.407
Lots of people come and go.
Sorry.

01:03:14.407 --> 01:03:15.374
Bro!

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:17.733
Aren't you playing?

01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:21.246
- Thanks anyway.
- Sure.

01:03:21.514 --> 01:03:22.981
I'm sorry about Mrs. LlM.

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.880
She was really nice to me.

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:49.533
Mr. JUNG ln-chul?

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.177
Police.

01:03:56.682 --> 01:03:59.344
You know Mrs. LlM,
the owner ofVictory Arcade?

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.025
She's my friend's mom.
Why?

01:04:08.127 --> 01:04:09.924
Can we go in to talk?

01:04:10.897 --> 01:04:11.921
What?

01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:15.465
Why?
We can talk out here.

01:04:15.968 --> 01:04:17.595
Is there something inside?

01:04:18.738 --> 01:04:21.036
No!
It's just a normal house.

01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:23.138
Open it.
Let's have a look.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.236
Back off!

01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:27.268
Are you really cops?

01:04:27.647 --> 01:04:28.705
Where's the warrant?

01:04:28.848 --> 01:04:30.076
What warrant?

01:04:30.182 --> 01:04:33.786
We just wanna go inside
and talk for a sec.

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.686
What's with you people?

01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:36.522
Just go!

01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:39.659
- It won't take long.
- Hey!

01:04:39.659 --> 01:04:40.751
- Stay put!
- Let go!

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:42.389
Who's he?

01:04:42.828 --> 01:04:44.955
Wasn't the insurance guy
her son?

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.528
- Maybe they're brothers.
- You think?

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:49.960
Her son?

01:04:50.336 --> 01:04:53.328
He came by sometimes
to the store.

01:04:53.606 --> 01:04:55.631
Mrs. LlM called him 'son'.

01:04:56.509 --> 01:04:59.842
He came by two days
before the fire.

01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:02.545
Wasn't it a few days more?

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.747
FOUND THE CULPRIT

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:13.051
Bring him in.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.718
Go in.

01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:18.622
Go on!

01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:20.164
Okay!

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.304
Oh man.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.573
We made a mistake.

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:46.517
You're not mad, are you?
Hope you understand.

01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:50.057
Stop by the station tomorrow.

01:05:51.163 --> 01:05:52.130
Sure.

01:05:54.266 --> 01:05:55.995
- Call before you come.
- Okay.

01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:57.399
Sorry.

01:06:04.777 --> 01:06:05.607
Shit!

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.645
Where'd it go?

01:06:14.253 --> 01:06:15.117
Where is it?

01:06:22.928 --> 01:06:25.897
CHICKEN SOUP

01:06:28.634 --> 01:06:30.158
The hell!

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.469
That bitch!

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:42.279
Looks like they're your mom's
bonds and jewelry.

01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:45.641
Someone called to ask about
exchanging them for cash.

01:06:46.686 --> 01:06:47.778
Where?

01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:51.455
Hurry over.

01:06:52.124 --> 01:06:54.183
Don't be late.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.430
- Ji-hyang isn't here!
- Back off! Bastard!

01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:08.599
Hey!
Where's the bitch?

01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:13.309
- Where is she!
- What's it to you?

01:07:14.346 --> 01:07:15.074
What?

01:07:15.147 --> 01:07:16.409
Who are you?

01:07:16.515 --> 01:07:18.813
I'm your fucking nightmare!

01:07:20.419 --> 01:07:23.877
Where the hell is she!

01:07:24.657 --> 01:07:27.820
- You find her!
- You fucking bitch.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:33.530
Fuck!

01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:35.759
Hey, Mister.

01:07:36.736 --> 01:07:37.794
What?

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:43.370
There's a place to exchange
jewelry for cash.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:47.306
She asked me for the number,
then left.

01:07:49.882 --> 01:07:52.214
How about
the arcade and insurance...

01:07:52.585 --> 01:07:55.577
in exchange for this lOU?

01:07:56.255 --> 01:08:01.591
I think it's the best thing
for everyone now.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.792
Where are you?

01:08:09.802 --> 01:08:12.270
I found the culprit.
Let's go.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:13.096
Bring your car!

01:08:13.205 --> 01:08:14.229
Where?

01:08:14.774 --> 01:08:15.832
Hey!

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.533
Shit!

01:08:25.818 --> 01:08:26.785
He's lost it.

01:08:26.886 --> 01:08:28.353
He's running around
Iike crazy.

01:08:28.554 --> 01:08:29.850
Stay close on his tail.

01:08:30.723 --> 01:08:31.951
He's the culprit.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.898
Mi-lan...

01:08:54.513 --> 01:08:55.343
No... I...

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.781
I gotta go.

01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:02.649
I have to go...
Sorry...

01:09:27.846 --> 01:09:29.508
No idea what you're saying.

01:09:34.486 --> 01:09:35.612
Mi-lan...

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.053
Should I learn sign language?

01:10:22.768 --> 01:10:24.201
SHE'S CARRYING
A RED BACKPACK

01:10:30.009 --> 01:10:31.340
- There! It's her!
- Huh?

01:10:36.448 --> 01:10:37.244
Hyun-tae!

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.676
Shit!

01:11:05.945 --> 01:11:06.843
Fuck!

01:11:23.329 --> 01:11:24.523
Help me!

01:11:30.636 --> 01:11:32.866
Stop yelling.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:35.370
- Quiet or you're dead.
- Okay.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.208
In-chul!

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.129
Honey! Wait!

01:11:57.129 --> 01:11:58.756
- Shut up!
- Sorry.

01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:01.659
Shut up!
Where's the ledger!

01:12:01.867 --> 01:12:03.635
Where's the damn ledger!

01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:07.662
Here!
It's right here!

01:12:09.675 --> 01:12:12.610
Why'd you take this!

01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:18.609
- I thought it was important.
- Bitch!

01:12:37.336 --> 01:12:38.826
Why isn't he answering!

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:43.565
In-chul!

01:12:47.579 --> 01:12:48.705
Just go.

01:12:49.982 --> 01:12:52.109
I can go?

01:12:52.418 --> 01:12:53.476
Get lost!

01:12:56.522 --> 01:12:59.548
So, it's over between us?

01:13:02.494 --> 01:13:03.984
Fuck you, bitch!

01:13:16.942 --> 01:13:18.432
- Why are you coming from there?
- Huh?

01:13:18.544 --> 01:13:19.806
Did you see the girl?

01:13:20.546 --> 01:13:22.173
You didn't either?

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:23.406
Damn!

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.217
Fine.

01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:26.718
Check that way.
I'll go this way.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:27.685
Hey, wait!

01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:59.414
Here.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:01.945
Drink this.

01:14:10.796 --> 01:14:14.960
I heard you went there
before Mom died.

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:19.094
Yeah...

01:14:19.771 --> 01:14:23.229
I told you I met her
when I gave you her card.

01:14:24.443 --> 01:14:27.742
How'd you know about the girl?

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.781
Did the cops tell you?

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:36.344
RYU, a guy mom used to deal with,
told me.

01:14:37.756 --> 01:14:38.745
Really?

01:14:40.859 --> 01:14:43.225
What a fuckin' nice guy.

01:14:45.998 --> 01:14:49.627
He told me in exchange
for the insurance payment.

01:14:50.269 --> 01:14:51.327
What?

01:14:51.837 --> 01:14:52.769
Hey!

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:55.600
Why the hell did you do that!

01:14:55.841 --> 01:14:57.172
You stupid!

01:14:57.543 --> 01:14:58.475
Fuck!

01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:00.972
Shit...

01:15:02.214 --> 01:15:03.306
Yes?

01:15:05.317 --> 01:15:06.409
Okay. Thank you.

01:15:07.319 --> 01:15:09.514
- Stupid fool.
- Let's go.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:11.620
Where?

01:15:11.957 --> 01:15:13.219
Dad gained consciousness.

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:28.402
This isn't a store.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.702
There's one down the road.

01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:32.135
Mr. KlM Min-su?

01:15:34.413 --> 01:15:35.937
You're KlM Min-su, right?

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:39.277
Who are you?

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:40.749
An insurance investigator.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.619
I have a few questions.

01:15:43.322 --> 01:15:45.813
You're friends with
LlM Hyun-tae and JUNG ln-chul?

01:15:48.493 --> 01:15:50.620
- Yes.
- Know about Victory Arcade?

01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:53.459
The place LlM's mother ran?

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.994
Between 9 PM and midnight
on November 24th...

01:15:58.103 --> 01:15:59.627
Where were you?

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:01.397
What?

01:16:02.374 --> 01:16:06.037
Where were you that night?
Don't remember?

01:16:09.781 --> 01:16:10.770
No.

01:16:11.383 --> 01:16:12.645
Your head...

01:16:13.185 --> 01:16:14.743
How did you hurt it?

01:16:15.954 --> 01:16:17.182
Just go.

01:16:18.423 --> 01:16:19.754
I got nothing to say.

01:16:20.726 --> 01:16:21.818
Really?

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:26.892
Mr. KlM?

01:16:27.799 --> 01:16:28.959
You know?

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:30.995
Rather than a stranger...

01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:34.630
the probability of getting killed
by someone close is higher.

01:16:34.973 --> 01:16:38.807
Getting killed by a son
or a friend...

01:16:39.378 --> 01:16:43.075
is much higher than
being stabbed by a stranger.

01:16:43.815 --> 01:16:45.442
Scary world, isn't it?

01:16:46.418 --> 01:16:48.909
After killing someone
so brutally...

01:16:49.388 --> 01:16:53.654
they live on as usual
as friends and such.

01:16:58.196 --> 01:16:59.424
See you again.

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:15.306
Are you okay?

01:17:16.782 --> 01:17:20.775
His vocal cords are damaged
from the smoke.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.530
Do you have paper
for him to write on?

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:33.498
- The chart.
- Here.

01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:41.237
Dad?
Write what you want to say.

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.607
MOM

01:18:02.794 --> 01:18:03.783
Mom is...

01:18:07.699 --> 01:18:09.098
getting treated.

01:18:11.036 --> 01:18:13.004
That's enough for today.

01:18:35.026 --> 01:18:35.894
Seizure!

01:18:35.894 --> 01:18:38.864
Take his son out now!

01:18:38.864 --> 01:18:40.899
- Father!
- Breathe slowly.

01:18:40.899 --> 01:18:43.435
- Stay out, please.
- Hurry!

01:18:43.435 --> 01:18:44.902
Bring the respirator!

01:18:45.337 --> 01:18:48.101
Breathe slowly.

01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:49.796
- Wait outside.
- Breathe in.

01:18:51.843 --> 01:18:53.470
Respirator! Hurry!

01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:56.372
Slowly. That's good.

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:57.846
Where is it!

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:06.685
He may not be able to
come out of his coma.

01:19:16.301 --> 01:19:17.632
Are you going to stay?

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:27.743
I gotta go
and take care of something.

01:19:28.914 --> 01:19:29.938
In-chul...

01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:36.254
Nothing...

01:19:37.322 --> 01:19:38.254
Go.

01:19:54.139 --> 01:19:56.471
CASE FILE

01:19:59.744 --> 01:20:01.939
Don't break the deal.

01:20:03.014 --> 01:20:09.476
If things go wrong,
I'll squeal everything.

01:20:12.457 --> 01:20:13.549
I'm curious...

01:20:14.759 --> 01:20:17.353
You happy this happened?

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:29.199
Cut the nonsense.

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:32.339
Have a drink.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:19.944
In the thick smoke
all dressed up

01:22:24.889 --> 01:22:28.586

01:27:01.866 --> 01:27:06.030
VICTORY ARCADE ARSONIST KIM MIN-SU
COMMIT SUICIDE. CASE CLOSED.

01:27:47.545 --> 01:27:49.376
KlM Min-su didn't do it alone.

01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:50.870
Here.

01:27:52.283 --> 01:27:57.687
It's the insurance policy
JUNG made with your mom.

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:02.052
KlM Min-su probably took part...

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.218
Hey.

01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:14.570
This was in Min-su's pocket.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:16.563
He died after meeting you.

01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:21.435
Leave us to deal with it
ourselves.

01:28:30.455 --> 01:28:31.979
I'll get to the point.

01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:35.622
I want Hyun-tae's agreement.

01:28:37.195 --> 01:28:38.526
Hand it over.

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:46.961
Have a drink.

01:28:47.438 --> 01:28:48.666
Fuck!

01:28:50.074 --> 01:28:53.976
Give me the agreement
on Victory Arcade!

01:28:54.312 --> 01:28:57.145
Hand it over!
You son of a bitch!

01:28:57.782 --> 01:29:01.218
I got it fair and square.
Why?

01:29:01.452 --> 01:29:02.851
Fair?

01:29:03.521 --> 01:29:07.981
I know about
Mrs. LlM's lOU!

01:29:08.292 --> 01:29:10.624
It's all in her ledger.

01:29:11.162 --> 01:29:15.064
She basically paid you all back!

01:29:17.135 --> 01:29:18.500
So?

01:29:18.836 --> 01:29:20.235
So? Fuck!

01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:24.706
I can prove it's all illegal!

01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:31.571
You sucked up way more than
what she owed, so let it go!

01:29:32.417 --> 01:29:34.885
Okay, fine.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:38.513
But...

01:29:40.992 --> 01:29:45.156
If you act up again,
I'll kill you.

01:29:49.267 --> 01:29:51.963
Ask me politely.

01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:56.766
Why do you want it?

01:29:58.009 --> 01:29:59.135
Well...

01:30:01.779 --> 01:30:04.339
My friend has to
inherit it, sir.

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:07.481
Please give it back.

01:30:09.353 --> 01:30:10.786
But I'm curious.

01:30:11.889 --> 01:30:16.588
Why is her ledger
in your hands?

01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:22.064
It went missing when she died,
but now it's here?

01:30:24.469 --> 01:30:26.300
What does that mean?

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.875
Fine!

01:30:34.378 --> 01:30:35.845
I killed her!

01:30:36.481 --> 01:30:42.487
I killed Hyun-tae's mom
and took it! So what!

01:30:42.487 --> 01:30:43.521
Fuck!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.820
What if I don't give it to you?

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:50.219
You'll try stabbing away here?

01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:53.626
Killing again is easy.
Is that it?

01:30:53.931 --> 01:30:55.364
Hell, yeah!

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.530
Try and kill me you bastard!

01:30:58.636 --> 01:31:00.433
Try it! Asshole!

01:31:03.808 --> 01:31:05.173
Fuck!

01:31:06.043 --> 01:31:07.567
Bastards!

01:31:08.679 --> 01:31:11.011
Give it to me!

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:15.777
Give me the fucking agreement!

01:32:04.068 --> 01:32:06.696
LOAN SHARK

01:32:10.908 --> 01:32:13.342
Hello, Mr. LIM?

01:32:52.883 --> 01:32:54.373
Uncle ln-chul!

01:33:01.292 --> 01:33:02.259
Hey.

01:33:07.498 --> 01:33:11.332
Why don't you ever come by?
And Uncle Min-su doesn't call.

01:33:11.435 --> 01:33:12.697
Did you fight with Dad?

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.298
Of course not.

01:33:21.078 --> 01:33:24.639
What's wrong?
Are you sick?

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.248
How've you been?

01:34:39.657 --> 01:34:40.851
Going somewhere?

01:34:44.729 --> 01:34:45.991
Hyun-tae...

01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.846
In-chul...

01:35:07.318 --> 01:35:08.216
Yeah?

01:35:09.453 --> 01:35:11.114
For 17 years...

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:14.819
I've wanted to ask you.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.725
Back in middle school...

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:20.096
Up on that mountain...

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:25.231
You went down alone
and brought help.

01:35:26.737 --> 01:35:28.329
After you left...

01:35:28.606 --> 01:35:32.542
I carried Min-su out in the snow
and got discovered.

01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:39.410
Know why I did that?

01:35:40.751 --> 01:35:44.653
Probably cuz you were scared.

01:35:45.956 --> 01:35:48.686
After you left,
I packed Min-su's bag...

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.724
and saw his Walkman missing.

01:35:53.831 --> 01:36:00.862
I wondered why you'd take
a Walkman with dead batteries.

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:05.841
I suddenly thought
you might not come back.

01:36:09.113 --> 01:36:13.675
- Why would I leave you two...
- I don't get it either.

01:36:13.784 --> 01:36:14.978
But back then...

01:36:15.519 --> 01:36:20.081
I really thought
you won't return to us.

01:36:26.664 --> 01:36:29.792
When I thought
you abandoned us there...

01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:32.492
Know what came to mind?

01:36:40.344 --> 01:36:42.642
I should leave Min-su
and run, too.

01:36:44.081 --> 01:36:48.814
Since you did it,
it'd be okay for me, too.

01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:02.759
Really?

01:37:10.474 --> 01:37:12.305
For the last 20 years...

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:15.776
That's how you felt about me?

01:37:21.785 --> 01:37:23.480
Must've been hard on you.

01:37:27.558 --> 01:37:29.048
Got anything to tell me?

01:37:37.968 --> 01:37:39.401
Have a good life.

01:37:40.738 --> 01:37:42.137
Take good care of Yuri.

01:37:51.549 --> 01:37:52.811
Min-su wrote it.

01:37:53.050 --> 01:37:54.517
There's a note for you, too.

01:37:59.857 --> 01:38:00.983
Goodbye.

01:38:35.359 --> 01:38:36.326
Thanks.

01:38:42.967 --> 01:38:43.956
What?

01:39:17.801 --> 01:39:18.961
Thank you.

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:54.715
WITH ME GONE,
MAYBE YOU TWO CAN MAKE UP

01:42:55.118 --> 01:42:58.144
BE GOOD TO HYUN-TAE FOR ME

01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:15.973
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, PALS

01:43:15.973 --> 01:43:17.941
I'M SORRY
