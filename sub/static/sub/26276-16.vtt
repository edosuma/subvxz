09:29.003 --> 09:30.482
Do you think Josh
really killed her?

09:30.526 --> 09:32.180
No idea.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.574
But either way,
the plea's a gift.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.750
Ten years instead of
life without parole?

09:36.793 --> 09:38.099
The best thing
you can do for Josh

09:38.142 --> 09:39.883
is to make sure he takes it.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.845
I just want this over with.
It's killing my mom.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.586
Do you really think
taking the deal

09:46.629 --> 09:47.587
makes this over?

09:49.545 --> 09:51.634
Look, I need your help.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.070
Okay, tell me about Libby.

09:53.114 --> 09:56.378
She was funny.
Way smarter than me.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.510
Beautiful.

09:58.554 --> 10:01.949
I loved her so much, it hurt.
You ever feel that way?

10:04.212 --> 10:08.912
Look, I-I want to help.
I just don't remember.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.958
[sighs]

10:13.090 --> 10:16.354
I know you're
a recovering alcoholic.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.226
Been sober
for six years.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.923
How'd you get clean?

10:19.967 --> 10:22.839
I white-knuckled it.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.755
For whatever reason,
this last time it took,

10:25.799 --> 10:27.539
till the day Libby was killed.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.019
And that's why
you can't remember.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.369
Started drinking early that day.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.328
Didn't take long
for me to black out.

10:33.371 --> 10:37.114
You know, alcoholism's
a progressive disease.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.812
When you weren't drinking,
it was doing push-ups,

10:38.855 --> 10:40.161
waiting for you
to pick it back up.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.293
How do you know
so much about it?

10:42.337 --> 10:47.168
I had a friend who I used to go
to AA meetings with for support.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.648
You know they have meetings
here, right?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.475
What's the point?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.216
For a lot of people, AA works.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.266
Why don't we start off
with what you do remember?

10:58.309 --> 11:01.878
[sighs]
Everything was great.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.967
Then, like a month
before Libby was killed,

11:04.011 --> 11:07.144
she started acting weird,
secretive.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.711
Always on her phone.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.105
Was making me crazy.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.716
I thought there was
someone else.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
Maybe that's why I drank.

11:15.457 --> 11:18.721
Hmm. And tell me about the day.
How did it start?

11:18.765 --> 11:23.378
Started at the 7-Eleven,
went home.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.641
She was mad I got drunk.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.252
I was mad she was on her phone
and wouldn't let me see it,

11:28.296 --> 11:29.819
so I...

11:29.863 --> 11:34.041
I grabbed it out her hand
and threw it across the room.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.130
After that, she threw me out.

11:36.173 --> 11:39.481
I kept drinking...
lost three days.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.091
Then the cops arrested me.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.703
Was there anybody that Libby
had problems with?

11:43.746 --> 11:46.488
Anybody that you think
could have done this?

11:46.531 --> 11:49.012
I told the cops. There was
this creepy stalker dude

11:49.056 --> 11:50.448
who worked at the bank with her.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.885
Do you have his name?

11:51.928 --> 11:53.190
She wouldn't tell me.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.193
Was afraid I'd go kick his ass.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.456
Libby always liked
to handle things by herself.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.853
Look, I promised your mom that
I was gonna find the truth.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.899
And I will.

12:05.942 --> 12:10.338
And what if the truth
is that I killed her?

12:20.783 --> 12:22.045
What are you doing
in my house?

12:22.089 --> 12:24.744
It's not your house,
Magnum, it's Robin's house.

12:24.787 --> 12:29.226
Yeah, but Josh's public defender
sent his case file to me, right?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.445
This is where you say touché.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.841
I'm afraid that Brianna
has sent you on a fool's errand.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.712
According to this file,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.496
her son is going to prison
for the rest of his life.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.671
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.151
Do you think he did it?

12:41.195 --> 12:42.979
Josh doesn't even know if
he did it; he blacked out.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.199
Yeah, so he says, but that
doesn't answer my question.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.724
I... I don't think he did it.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.119
That sounds like you don't
want to think he did it.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.685
You don't want
to disappoint Brianna.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.906
Single mother, raising her child
alone after his father died.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.343
Does that sound like
someone we know?

12:59.387 --> 13:02.607
Thanks for the free analysis.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.957
Well, maybe.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.220
Look, I met the kid, right?

13:06.263 --> 13:07.787
He seems kind.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.223
I mean, sure,
he's got his problems,

13:09.266 --> 13:10.528
but I don't think
he's the kind of guy

13:10.572 --> 13:12.269
who bludgeons
his girlfriend to death.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.532
And in your experience
what does that guy look like?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.447
I know it when I see it.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.320
My gut tells me
Josh didn't do it.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.626
And I got to trust my gut;
that's why Brianna hired me.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.542
Okay, this is where
I say touché.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.850
Well, we got to start somewhere.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.331
It says here
that HPD never found

13:30.374 --> 13:32.724
Libby's phone--
that's kind of odd. Can you...?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.335
Could you maybe...?Yeah. I already
tried pinging it.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.206
The last signal it emitted was
from inside their apartment

13:36.250 --> 13:37.555
on the day she died.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.122
Must've broke
when Josh threw it.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.342
Maybe it's still
in the apartment.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.213
Oh, uh, Josh told me
about this creepy guy

13:43.257 --> 13:45.346
that worked at the bank
that Libby was at.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.564
Yeah, it's in the file.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.392
A "creepy stalker"
was the term he used.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.264
But no name?No, there's no other
mention of him

13:50.307 --> 13:52.570
other than in Josh's
police interview.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.659
They never followed up
or questioned him.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.226
Why not?Well, no need.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.316
They already had
a solid case against Josh.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.448
Well, got to start somewhere.

14:00.491 --> 14:01.841
I guess I'll go check out
the bank.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.279
I know you want to ask
to come along.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.759
[chuckles]
We're running out of time.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.283
Two heads is better than one.
Come on.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
Or one and a half.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.417
Very funny.
I thought so.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.682
BANK MANAGER:
Come in, Trey.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.989
This is Mr. Magnum
and Ms. Higgins.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.208
They want to ask you
some questions.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.731
You cops?

14:22.774 --> 14:26.169
No. He's a private investigator
and I'm his associate.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.389
Then why should I answer them?

14:28.432 --> 14:29.607
Because I manage this bank,

14:29.651 --> 14:32.436
because you work for me,
and because I asked.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.655
Where were you the day

14:33.698 --> 14:34.961
Libby Conner was killed?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.310
Because we know
you weren't at work.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.268
Am I in some kind of trouble?

14:38.312 --> 14:40.836
No, just... answer
the question, please.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.404
I don't need an alibi. The guy
who killed her is in jail.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.971
He's yet to be tried.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.278
Trey, Libby filed
two complaints against you.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.019
Even asked to move stations.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.587
She also said she saw you
following her more than once.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.545
You don't know what
you're talking about.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.591
If they're not cops,
they can't do anything to me.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.289
If you want to fire me, fire me.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.335
Otherwise, I'm going
back to work.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.512
Lovely gent.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.644
How is it that he
still works here?

15:06.688 --> 15:09.169
Well, it's harder to fire
someone than you think.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.258
MAGNUM:
Is there anything else
you witnessed

15:11.301 --> 15:12.868
that would make you think
he could've killed Libby?

15:12.912 --> 15:16.350
No. Mostly variations
on what you just saw.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.266
He's got anger issues
and a hell of a temper.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.445
MAGNUM:
While Trey is
a walking red flag,

15:24.488 --> 15:25.794
it's still a jump to murder.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.622
Given the time crunch,
I thought it best

15:27.665 --> 15:29.319
to divide and conquer.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.321
Higgins is doing
a deeper dive into Trey.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.149
Meantime, I'm gonna
call my best friend

15:33.193 --> 15:36.239
and see what HPD knows
that isn't in the file.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.241
[phone ringing]

15:38.285 --> 15:39.721
Whatever you want,
my answer's no.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.070
But a life is on the line.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.376
Detective Dole
already investigated

15:42.419 --> 15:43.333
Libby Conner's murder.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.334
How did you know...

15:44.378 --> 15:45.422
He painstakingly collected

15:45.466 --> 15:46.684
evidence and brought it
to the P.A.,

15:46.728 --> 15:48.382
who decided
to prosecute Josh Healy

15:48.425 --> 15:50.297
because the case was solid.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.515
Yeah, but there was
another suspect

15:51.559 --> 15:52.560
who was never interviewed.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.605
Police work 101:
you follow leads.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.956
When one pans out, you don't
then follow the other hundred.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.566
That would waste time
and resources.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.220
What if Josh is innocent?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.178
I'm certain you'll prove it.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.441
Really?No.

16:04.485 --> 16:08.054
Okay, the case file never
mentioned Libby's phone.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.969
Well, then, it wasn't found.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.057
You don't find that strange?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.841
Everyone uploads to the cloud.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.234
They likely reviewed
what was pertinent.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.236
Can you see
if they found anything?

16:16.279 --> 16:17.237
You know I don't work for you.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.629
So, is that a no?

16:24.244 --> 16:26.028
If I can find Libby's phone
at their apartment,

16:26.072 --> 16:28.509
maybe we'll have more
to go on.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.125
Probably should have
asked Brianna for a key.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.650
Oh, God.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.478
You scared the hell
out of me.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.393
I'm sorry, but what
are you doing here?

16:43.437 --> 16:45.613
I was feeding Harry.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.354
Josh's turtle.
Come on.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.016
So, do you have any news?

16:57.059 --> 17:00.019
I just wanted to see
if HPD missed anything.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.545
This place was a mess.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.937
I cleaned it up
after the cops left,

17:05.981 --> 17:08.592
'cause her blood was, like...

17:08.636 --> 17:10.768
Yeah.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.380
Did you happen to find
Libby's phone?No.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.598
But everything should
pretty much be here,

17:14.642 --> 17:16.687
'cause Libby didn't have
any family, so...

17:16.731 --> 17:18.515
You're free to look around.

17:27.698 --> 17:31.137
Mr. Magnum, come in here.
I want to show you something.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.489
[chuckles]

17:35.532 --> 17:37.839
Isn't that pretty?
He loves to sketch.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.101
Wow.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.843
He was gonna go
to art school before, um...

17:46.674 --> 17:47.631
Yeah, he's really good.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.329
So, I have a question for you.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.289
Do you think there's time
for you to find anything?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.813
If there's something to
find, I'm gonna find it.

17:55.857 --> 17:59.165
You know, um,
all these years,

17:59.208 --> 18:02.298
I've been both mother
and father to Josh.

18:02.342 --> 18:06.346
But his, his drinking just
really got in the way.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.565
And I'm wondering maybe
if I had done more...

18:08.609 --> 18:10.437
You know none of this
is your fault.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.873
You don't know that.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.965
You know, when I was--
when I was six,

18:17.008 --> 18:18.140
I lost my father,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.273
and I miss him every day.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.233
I turned out pretty good.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.322
And most of the credit
goes to my mom.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.369
She was... she was enough.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.546
My bet is you are, too.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.505
That's why you took
this case, isn't it?

18:37.638 --> 18:38.595
I thought it was
'cause you felt guilty

18:38.639 --> 18:39.901
about getting out
of jury duty.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.382
No, I took this case
because you needed help.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.779
Hey, I'm not giving up. Okay?

18:48.823 --> 18:51.304
Okay.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.269
Hey, anything new on Trey?

19:00.313 --> 19:01.662
HIGGINS:
Usually there's a pattern.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.620
So I checked with previous
employers, neighbors,

19:03.664 --> 19:04.665
but there was nothing.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.232
Yeah, same thing
at the apartment.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.321
I think the killer must have
taken Libby's phone.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.542
Hey, uh, I got to go.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.070
[whistles]
Oh...

19:19.114 --> 19:20.115
488.

19:21.638 --> 19:22.857
Nice.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.467
Yeah, I like it.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.903
You really have to know
what you're doing

19:25.947 --> 19:27.078
to drive a car like this.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.080
Yeah, I'm pretty safe.I'm sure you are.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.343
You know, you never know

19:30.386 --> 19:31.431
what someone else might do,
right?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.694
I mean, you could still
get T-boned.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.350
Imagine the air bag was
disabled,

19:37.393 --> 19:38.916
and Higgins is sitting
in the passenger seat.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.483
Who are you?

19:40.527 --> 19:43.443
Nobody.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.314
Yeah, I just learned
over the years

19:45.358 --> 19:46.924
that bad things are
less likely to happen

19:46.968 --> 19:48.839
when you don't go looking into
matters that don't concern you.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.582
Like dead bank tellers.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.104
I'm sorry.
I was worried about you.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.671
That almost sounded genuine.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.194
I was out front with Kumu.
What's wrong?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.283
I was just threatened
at a gas station

20:41.327 --> 20:42.328
to back off the investigation.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.286
By who?I don't know.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.679
It was an Asian guy,
he was well-dressed,

with tinted windows

20:52.338 --> 20:53.339
The station on Liliha?

20:53.382 --> 20:55.602
How'd you know that?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.081
They sell the cheapest petrol,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.301
and you pay with coins you find
under the floor mat.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.304
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
call Katsumoto,

21:02.348 --> 21:03.871
just to cover all our bases.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.655
You know what this means, right?

21:05.699 --> 21:07.701
Josh didn't kill Libby.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.878
SHAMMY:
She works

21:10.921 --> 21:12.053
at the DMV?

21:12.096 --> 21:13.446
No way. I don't buy it.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.448
Why, because
she's attractive?

21:15.491 --> 21:16.884
[chuckles]

21:16.927 --> 21:18.233
Man, if you
didn't know me,

21:18.277 --> 21:20.017
what would you think
I did for a living?

21:20.061 --> 21:22.846
Florist or contract killer.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.326
[laughs]

21:24.370 --> 21:26.807
Shammy, TC, this is Lisa.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.025
Nice to meet you guys.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.897
Nice to meet you.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.290
Uh, so I only have
a few minutes.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.943
Hey, thanks
for doing this for us.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.945
Oh, no, no, no. No. She did
it for me, and for a ride

21:34.989 --> 21:36.512
in TC's chopper.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.297
Anytime.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.299
This is for a vet,
so whatever it takes.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.126
Here you go.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.824
Hey, so when you get
what you need...

21:43.867 --> 21:45.434
Right, this never happened.
Burn it.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.611
It's a crappy job, but until
I get another modeling gig...

21:48.655 --> 21:50.309
I knew it.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.354
Take it easy, would you?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.790
Thank you.
Thanks.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.749
I'll see you soon.
Yeah.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.099
LISA:
Later, guys.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.623
Oh, man. Must be 35 names here.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.842
Well, narrow it down.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.583
It's got to be somebody
from this area.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.585
Why? People don't steal
from other towns?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.978
No, because they had
to know the stuff was new.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.545
I mean, they probably saw it
getting delivered.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.330
RICK:
Yeah, and you know what?
I bet this guy

22:11.373 --> 22:13.244
probably got out of here fast.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.376
He didn't want to drive around
all night

22:14.420 --> 22:15.769
with a truck bed
full of hot items.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.161
Exactly.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.380
All right,
maybe this is our guy.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.948
Mitch Mookini. Lives nearby.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.386
Definitely looks like a thief.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.474
RICK:
All right.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.346
Let's go. [lock buzzes]

22:28.434 --> 22:30.436
I have some good news.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.872
I was just threatened
by a man who wants me

22:31.915 --> 22:33.830
to stop looking
into Libby's murder.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.441
Why is that good?

22:35.484 --> 22:37.312
Because i-it means somebody else
was involved in this,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.009
potentially this guy.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.402
This could be the first piece
of information

22:40.446 --> 22:41.447
that could help exonerate you.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.187
If I'm really innocent.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.886
Why is it you want to believe
the worst in yourself?

22:45.929 --> 22:47.975
In the past,
it was usually true.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.237
Yeah, but you turned
your life around.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.543
Until I got drunk
and threw it all away.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.761
You don't know what I was like.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.023
But your mother does. Okay?

22:53.067 --> 22:54.503
She believes in you.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.418
And until you believe
in yourself again, I want you

22:56.462 --> 22:59.203
to hold onto that and don't take
the prosecutor's deal.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.423
The trial will start tomorrow.Yeah,

23:01.467 --> 23:02.598
but now I have something
to go on.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.947
With the deal, I do ten years.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.472
With a conviction,
I go away forever.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.517
I-I can't. I-I won't make it.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.084
Are you listening to me?

23:10.127 --> 23:12.434
Somebody else did this.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.914
Look, I-I want to believe you.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.959
And if you're right,
I want to know who.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.308
Then what's the problem?

23:17.352 --> 23:18.440
What if you can't prove it?

23:18.484 --> 23:19.920
M-My life is on the line here.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.749
Okay, look,

23:22.792 --> 23:25.534
uh, the guy who threatened me
was Asian,

23:25.578 --> 23:27.362
uh, about five-11,

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
had a nice suit.
Does that ring a bell?

23:29.451 --> 23:32.976
He drove a black Mercedes
G-Wagen with tinted windows.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.806
Wait.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.678
It was a while ago,
before Libby was killed.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.810
I-I didn't think it mattered,
I would've told someone.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.899
So you saw him?One day I left
for work,

23:42.943 --> 23:45.815
I forgot my phone,
so I went back home.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.818
The guy was standing there,
looking at our building.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.604
I remember the G-Wagen 'cause
it was always my dream car.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.736
I was gonna ask him about it,
but when he saw me,

23:53.780 --> 23:55.259
he got in his car and left.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.697
At the time I thought maybe
he was lost or something.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.481
Was there anything else
you remember about him

23:59.525 --> 24:01.396
or maybe the car?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.920
He had a parking sticker
with a sunset.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.401
I noticed it because the car
was all black

24:06.445 --> 24:08.490
so it kind of stood out,
and the art was cool.

24:08.534 --> 24:09.665
You think you can draw it?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.450
Absolutely.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.497
Your Honor.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.586
Uh, this'll only
take a minute.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.502
I dismissed you this morning.
Why are you here?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
Uh, the accused, Josh Healy,

24:22.156 --> 24:23.853
his mother hired me
to prove his innocence.

24:23.897 --> 24:27.596
Okay, not only are you
disrupting my court proceedings,

24:27.640 --> 24:29.511
but this is ex parte
communication,

24:29.555 --> 24:31.557
which is strictly forbidden.
You need to go.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.341
No, but you don't understand.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.343
You have to delay
the start of the trial.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.127
I have to do no such thing.Yeah, but something
just happened,

24:37.171 --> 24:38.825
and if you give me time
to follow up,

24:38.868 --> 24:40.479
it could lead to evidence.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.177
Leave now,
or I'll hold you in contempt.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.484
It's just one day.
That's all I'm asking for,

24:45.527 --> 24:46.615
and I can prove
Josh didn't do it.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.661
Bailiff.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.240
[phone ringing]

25:03.284 --> 25:04.633

Hello?

25:04.677 --> 25:05.895
MAGNUM:
I need your help.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.723
What number is this?
Where are you?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.203
I am in jail.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.334
Why?

25:10.378 --> 25:11.466
I tried to get a delay
on the trial,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.120
judge held me in contempt.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.338
I know the feeling.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.689
Did you apologize to the judge?

25:16.732 --> 25:19.518
I tried three times.
She wouldn't budge.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.563
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?Higgins, we're running

25:21.607 --> 25:23.565
out of time. You got to find
a way to get me out of here.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.351
I have an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.441
I don't care. Whatever it takes.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.531
And do it fast.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.010
Honestly,
I can't thank you enough.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.925
Turns out, Higgins can be
even more annoying than you.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.579
[laughs]:
Right?

25:37.623 --> 25:38.972
Now I have to take
the judge to dinner.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.974
She's a complicated woman.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.498
Wait. Hold on,
you and Judge Kamaka dated?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.674
Contrary to what you tried to
sell in court this morning--

25:45.718 --> 25:47.937
perjury, by the way--
we are not best friends.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.678
My personal life is
none of your business.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.594
When did it end? Or-or did
it end? I don't know.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.727
I was wrong. You and Higgins
are equally annoying.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.467
Yeah, well,
I've been called worse.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.382
Hey, were you able
to find the guy

25:58.426 --> 26:00.384
at the gas station on Liliha?

26:00.428 --> 26:02.473
No. Station has no cameras.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.345
And I couldn't find a
witness to the exchange.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.521
Oh, it wasn't an exchange.
I mean, this guy threatened me.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.131
Glock and all.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.003
Look, this isn't about me
or about a case,

26:10.046 --> 26:12.135
this is about a young kid's
life, and I'm telling you,

26:12.179 --> 26:13.572
we're running out of time.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.703
Yeah, well, I'll keep digging.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.488
Try to stay
out of jail.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.490
I'll try.

26:20.753 --> 26:21.884
How was your stay
in the big house?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.451
Thanks for getting me out.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.105
Josh's future depends on it.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.410
Yeah, but also because
you didn't want me

26:26.454 --> 26:27.586
locked up in jail, right?

26:29.805 --> 26:33.722
Anyway, Katsumoto said there was
no cameras at the gas station.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.637
Yeah, I gleaned as much from
my search. But at least you know

26:35.681 --> 26:37.465
what the guy looks like
and the car he drives.

26:37.508 --> 26:41.512
Also, potentially
where he lives.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.472
Guy staked out, uh, Libby's
place before she was killed.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.430
Josh sketched it out,
it's a parking decal.

26:46.474 --> 26:49.216
[typing]

26:49.259 --> 26:52.654
How long do you think before you
might be able to get something?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.221
He lives in the Palm Regent.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.527
It's a fancy high-rise
in Ward Village.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.529
Well, maybe we can hack into
the building's parking records

26:58.573 --> 26:59.661
and get a name.

26:59.705 --> 27:00.793
"We"?

27:00.836 --> 27:02.577
You.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.494
RICK:
All right, there's the truck.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.496
Just pull over
right here, okay?

27:08.539 --> 27:10.672
SHAMMY:
Custom off-road
package, slick rims.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.414
Definitely belongs to
our appliance thief.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.069
Hey.

27:16.112 --> 27:17.897
Looks like a SKU sticker.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.248
Could have fallen off
one of the stolen appliances.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.598
Let me see that.
Tiny can help us out with this.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.556
Who's Tiny?

27:25.600 --> 27:27.471
Works at a hardware store.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.256
Can run the bar code
through his scanner.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.518
SHAMMY:
How do you have
so many friends

27:30.561 --> 27:31.824
willing to do anything for you?

27:31.867 --> 27:33.564
Buddy, we'd be willing
to do anything for you.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.218
Let's not get crazy.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.699
Okay, you know what? I'd be
willing to do anything for you.
