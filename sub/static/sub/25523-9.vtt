WEBVTT

01:24.959 --> 01:28.505
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

01:29.047 --> 01:33.134
I feel the fear,
sweat dripping away

01:33.718 --> 01:37.472
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

01:38.223 --> 01:43.603
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

01:44.771 --> 01:47.816
Even when the clouds drift away

01:49.192 --> 01:52.278
Even when my skin dries away

01:53.279 --> 01:56.741
I'll be back someday

01:57.909 --> 02:01.788
To unleash my return

02:06.376 --> 02:10.004
I have the dust that protects the road

02:10.797 --> 02:14.509
I have the branches of a leafless tree

02:15.343 --> 02:19.180
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:19.722 --> 02:25.019
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

02:26.229 --> 02:29.315
Even when the clouds drift away

02:30.608 --> 02:33.862
Even when my skin dries away

02:34.737 --> 02:38.241
I'll be back someday

02:39.409 --> 02:43.246
To unleash my return

02:49.252 --> 02:50.295
ALTIPLANO PRISON
STATE OF MEXICO

04:46.411 --> 04:48.705
Guzman. Visitor.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.405
Bad news?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.242
Issues between Quino and Damaso.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
-Is Quino all right?
-Yes.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.496
But the situation is out of control.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.461
ISMAEL'S HOME
CULIACAN, MEXICO

05:55.813 --> 05:59.067
Joaquin, they both say
you gave them control.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
That you named them leaders
of the organization in your absence.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.533
If you don't do something,
it'll be a mess.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.703
You know everything
I've done for Joaquin.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.789
Everything I do for the organization.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.084
Do you think the kid deserves
to be in charge?

06:20.254 --> 06:21.881
I don't need anybody to tell me
what to do.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.716
I've got the balls

06:23.800 --> 06:25.384
to manage the organization on my own.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.012
Quino is not a kid anymore,
Damaso.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
It's natural...

06:30.807 --> 06:32.350
that he now wants to take the lead.

06:35.061 --> 06:35.978
Quino...

06:37.563 --> 06:40.233
you know the importance
of Damaso for the organization.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.735
He's a great leader.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.946
He has your dad's trust.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.032
He has been with Joaquin
since Puente Grande.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.208
If Quino says that my friend

06:57.291 --> 06:58.876
left him in charge, I believe him.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.878
According to Damaso, he did do it.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.798
I believe him.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.260
That's a lie, Ismael.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.470
My dad never told him anything.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.869
Let's keep our eyes on
Quino and his people.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.997
That kid will not know
how to manage the business.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.545
That asshole won't be my boss.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.466
He will prove

07:46.549 --> 07:47.884
that he's not ready to be the boss.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.639
We will show them I can
manage the organization

07:53.723 --> 07:54.807
much better than he can.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.351
Ismael sent me
to give you this information.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.313
And to ask you who is in charge.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.523
Did you give it to Damaso or to Quino?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.571
At this moment,
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman

08:08.821 --> 08:11.574
is being taken from the navy's hangar
and shown to the press.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.035
After 13 years as a fugitive,

08:14.160 --> 08:15.786
this is the face of the most wanted

08:15.870 --> 08:17.246
drug lord in the world.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.679
Sorry to bother you, sir.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.265
I have a letter from your dad.

08:36.974 --> 08:37.850
Thank you.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.571
Damaso.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.739
Thanks for coming.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.199
Thanks for the invitation.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.701
What are we celebrating?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.202
A surprise, come.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.581
I organized this party
to tell you something very important.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.666
So important that I asked

09:43.791 --> 09:45.167
the guys to compose a song.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.213
My dad has finally confirmed it.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.007
Listen.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.676
Play the song!

10:05.229 --> 10:07.898
Here's El Chapo's letter

10:08.024 --> 10:10.901
That he sends out to everyone

10:11.110 --> 10:13.237
He writes from Altiplano

10:13.321 --> 10:16.949
There's a new boss in this place

10:17.241 --> 10:19.994
Don't feel down, my people

10:20.077 --> 10:22.913
Things are so clear, now

10:23.080 --> 10:25.291
Sinaloa's future

10:25.499 --> 10:28.502
Falls to "El Chapito" Quino Guzman

10:29.545 --> 10:31.922
As the cartel leader

10:32.006 --> 10:35.009
His son is now in charge

10:35.092 --> 10:37.553
And now he calls the shots

10:37.637 --> 10:40.848
The order is to split the cake

10:41.349 --> 10:42.224
Damaso!

10:43.059 --> 10:44.101
Damaso, what's going on?

10:44.935 --> 10:45.853
Nobody will believe you.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.689
I swear I got a letter
from him, telling me that.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.441
I thought you would be happy for me.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.902
You're just a kid.
You can't be the successor.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.363
In his letter he asked me
to tell everyone.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.490
Ismael already knows it.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.908
You were the only one left to find out.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.534
Damaso...

11:01.661 --> 11:03.162
I'll make operational changes
in the organization.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.415
I already thought about it all.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.376
I will respect your way of working,

11:08.626 --> 11:10.044
and your territories.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.004
Come on, dude!

11:12.171 --> 11:13.255
Let's get some drinks.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.173
Let's celebrate.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.050
You'll never tell me what to do.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.135
Without Joaquin here,

11:18.219 --> 11:19.970
I'm responsible for the organization.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.099
The power belongs to me.

11:28.312 --> 11:31.190
QUINO'S DISTRIBUTION HOUSE
CULIACAN, MEXICO

12:01.512 --> 12:03.848
VALCARCEL
ACCOUNTANT

12:06.183 --> 12:07.726
-Mr. Quino.
-Sit down, Valcarcel.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.897
How many dealers do we have
working in this place?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.191
Like... 50.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.153
And how often do they come by?

12:17.528 --> 12:18.446
Weekly.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.739
Fifty dealers that buy from us

12:20.823 --> 12:22.533
in all the Culiacan houses, weekly?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.201
Approximately, sir.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.246
We will improve
the way in which we operate.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.665
It's OK that they make
good money with our drugs.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.376
But it could benefit the organization

12:32.460 --> 12:33.836
more directly with what they sell.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.045
A tax?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.714
Yes.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.508
They can keep taking
the merchandise at the same price,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.344
but they have to give us 10%
of everything they sell.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.888
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.474
Take care of it.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.701
DEALERS

13:09.246 --> 13:10.122
The usual?

13:10.789 --> 13:11.624
Same.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.170
Gentlemen...

13:17.254 --> 13:19.381
From now on, the boss is
imposing new rules.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.093
A 10% tax on all the sales.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.141
Any problems?

13:35.940 --> 13:36.815
No.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.108
This is fucked up.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.360
People don't want to pay more.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.070
What's up, boys?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.323
-What's up?
-How much, dude?

15:07.406 --> 15:08.866
-Fifteen bucks.
-No...

15:09.116 --> 15:11.410
-It's too expensive...
-Fellas, it's just...

15:11.952 --> 15:13.913
And if on top of that
they charge us with that tax,

15:14.038 --> 15:15.080
what's our profit?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.708
No, it's cheaper somewhere else.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.256
What do we do?

15:29.553 --> 15:31.138
We can stop working for Quino.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.598
No way!

15:33.390 --> 15:34.683
We wouldn't get away with it.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.561
I'll pay you the usual,

15:38.145 --> 15:39.146
or I'll buy it somewhere else.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.859
All right.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.909
Right now, he's the man.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.243
His father gave him the spot.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.747
Going with someone else would be like
going against Mr. Joaquin himself.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.083
What's up?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.377
-What's up, bro?
-How are you?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.213
Why those faces?

16:05.923 --> 16:07.257
Fucking Quino changed the deal.

16:08.842 --> 16:09.885
How about you guys?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.345
Damaso hasn't changed anything?

16:11.845 --> 16:12.680
No.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.014
What did he change?

16:25.693 --> 16:26.735
Hello.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.237
Sir,

16:29.071 --> 16:30.072
I've got something that may interest you.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.034
Get them together.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.882
DAMASO'S DISTRIBUTION HOUSE
CULIACAN, MEXICO

16:48.966 --> 16:50.843
I want you to spread the word
that everyone is welcome here.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.179
If they come to work with me,

16:55.264 --> 16:56.348
they won't pay any tax.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
But can we buy from you with no problems?

17:02.354 --> 17:04.481
In the end, we all work
for the same organization.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.359
Quino shouldn't be upset by it.

17:12.823 --> 17:13.699
What if he does get upset?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.075
The issue would be with me!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.120
If he messes with you,

17:18.829 --> 17:20.205
he would be messing with my people.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.875
And I take care of my people.

17:27.129 --> 17:27.963
Nothing?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.009
The whole day?

17:37.264 --> 17:38.432
Let's see, fuckers...

17:39.516 --> 17:40.559
do you know something?

17:48.150 --> 17:48.984
Hello?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.110
Sir,

17:50.360 --> 17:51.361
we have a problem.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.571
What is it?

17:52.821 --> 17:53.739
The dealers...

17:54.782 --> 17:56.241
are flipping to go work with Damaso.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.327
How many?

17:59.036 --> 17:59.953
Most of them.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.123
Son of a bitch.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.416
Just say the word,

18:04.708 --> 18:06.168
do we look for them and fuck them up?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.254
No, leave them alone.
The issue is not with them.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.340
Meet me at the southern exit.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.508
Come with a group.

18:13.050 --> 18:13.926
All right.

18:27.940 --> 18:33.904
DAMASO'S SAFE HOUSE
MARIJUANA FIELD, QUILA, MEXICO

19:12.109 --> 19:12.943
Let's go!

19:46.435 --> 19:47.394
Watch out, fuckers!

19:48.353 --> 19:49.188
Watch out!

19:52.524 --> 19:54.526
If you have the balls
to come into my territory...

19:56.570 --> 19:58.155
let's handle this face to face!

19:58.655 --> 19:59.489
Don't shoot.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.632
I'm the boss now, Damaso.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.009
If your men shoot,

20:19.092 --> 20:20.594
you'll start a war
you don't want to fight.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.263
You know these lands belong to me.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.892
Your dad gave them to me.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.311
I have every right to defend them.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.647
And what will you do?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.108
Will you kill El Chapo
Guzman's son?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.290
So, do we go back to Culiacan, sir?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.002
Yeah, but we'll be back tomorrow.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.838
We won't let any fucking kid

20:56.922 --> 20:58.131
dispose of what belongs to us.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.636
If that means war...

21:06.014 --> 21:07.182
I won't be the one running away.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.316
We've been at it
all night with this, Joaquin.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.902
Going to Mazatlán is too risky.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.154
Sol betrayed me.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.991
I have to disappear for a few days.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.997
But I won't go without seeing
Elba and the girls.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.623
I understand.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.543
But going from here to Los Cabos
is safer.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.045
The sooner you are in that territory,
the better.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.132
It's out of the government's radar,
you said it.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.258
Bravo!

21:44.011 --> 21:44.970
Yes, sir?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.305
Coordinate your people
in Mazatlán,

21:46.722 --> 21:47.764
reinforce the security.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.018
We're going to see my daughters.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.695
You'll be playing straight
into their hands, dude.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.199
I know.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.536
But if anything happens to me,

22:09.995 --> 22:10.996
I want to ask you something.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.840
Do you remember how these lands
were when I gave them to you?

22:23.258 --> 22:24.134
Of course.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.963
I trust I'll be back from Mazatlán
without any issues.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.592
And once I'm in Los Cabos,

23:07.636 --> 23:08.762
I will fix this issue.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.516
But if something bad happens to me,

23:12.682 --> 23:14.101
I want you to be in charge
of the organization.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.481
And Quino?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.441
His time will come.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.070
He's my son and I love him,
but he's still too young.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.656
He still has a lot to learn.

23:29.157 --> 23:29.991
I want you to guide him,

23:30.784 --> 23:32.202
and when you think he's ready,

23:33.578 --> 23:34.412
leave it to him.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.040
Thanks, Joaquin.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.043
I trust everything will come out well.
But if not,

23:41.503 --> 23:43.463
I will take the lead
of the organization with pleasure.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.549
And I will guide Quino.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.426
I promise.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.150
At this time,
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman,

24:03.275 --> 24:06.069
is being taken out of the navy's hangar
and shown to the press.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.155
After 13 years as a fugitive,

24:08.363 --> 24:09.656
this is the face
of the most wanted drug lord

24:09.739 --> 24:11.241
in the world.

24:48.904 --> 24:49.738
Quino!

24:51.281 --> 24:52.365
Thanks for coming.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.618
Thanks for the invitation.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.620
-What are we celebrating?
-Come on!

25:05.045 --> 25:06.922
Everything is ready for me
to take get charge.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.215
Of what?

25:09.216 --> 25:10.133
Before being captured in Mazatlán,

25:10.884 --> 25:12.469
your dad entrusted me
with the leadership of the organization.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.764
He asked me to take care of you
if something happened to him.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.475
And guide you in the business.

25:21.102 --> 25:21.978
He wanted me to take over

25:22.062 --> 25:23.647
until you're ready to be the boss.

25:25.899 --> 25:26.775
I don't need anybody.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.068
You have your own territories,

25:29.152 --> 25:30.695
he couldn't give you power over ours,

25:30.779 --> 25:31.696
that's impossible.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.656
He did.

25:32.739 --> 25:33.907
Everybody knows it.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.451
Ismael always knew it.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.870
We have been organizing

25:38.954 --> 25:40.580
and I'm ready
to fulfill what I promised to him.

25:41.081 --> 25:41.915
I don't believe you.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.750
Quino.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.168
Quino!

25:46.294 --> 25:47.587
I promised your dad.

25:48.964 --> 25:49.965
Don't disappoint him.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.053
He wants us to keep
building Sinaloa together,

25:55.136 --> 25:56.888
into he most powerful organization
in the world.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.641
Come on, dude!

26:00.392 --> 26:01.643
Let's have some drinks and celebrate.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.811
I'm his son, fucker!

26:04.271 --> 26:05.981
In his absence, the power belongs to me.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.111
Let's go!

26:17.200 --> 26:19.202
How many dealers
do we have working in this territory?

26:19.995 --> 26:21.830
Like... 50.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.999
Let's change the way we operate.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.209
Enough of them making
so much money with our drugs

26:26.293 --> 26:27.460
and me getting nothing.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.337
Let's charge them a tax.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.674
Is that clear?

26:39.055 --> 26:39.889
Is something wrong?

26:42.309 --> 26:43.935
Did you already discuss it
with Mr. Damaso?

26:45.395 --> 26:47.147
Mr. Ismael told us that
he would give the instructions

26:47.230 --> 26:48.523
now that Mr. Joaquin isn't here.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.777
Without my dad here,

26:53.445 --> 26:54.863
this territory belongs to me.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.241
I'll decide how to manage it.

27:00.744 --> 27:01.828
The usual?

27:02.579 --> 27:03.413
Same.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.208
Gentlemen...

27:10.128 --> 27:12.380
from now on, the boss
is imposing new rules.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.594
A 10% tax on all the sales.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.931
He's charging us to sell it?

27:23.099 --> 27:24.267
We don't work like that, Berny.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.977
You give me the stuff and I pay you.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.520
What I sell is mine.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.734
Well, if you want
to keep working for Quino

27:32.817 --> 27:33.818
and not get into trouble,

27:34.652 --> 27:35.612
you'll have to pay.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.697
That's the new deal.

27:41.868 --> 27:42.744
Any problem?

27:51.711 --> 27:52.587
No.

28:32.710 --> 28:33.795
Now it's like that.

28:33.878 --> 28:34.712
No way, dude.

28:35.630 --> 28:36.589
That's fucked up.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.508
People aren't willing to pay more.

28:38.591 --> 28:39.801
It's cheaper somewhere else.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.013
And if on top of that
they charge us with that tax,

28:44.472 --> 28:45.306
what's our profit?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.224
...in another place.

28:48.852 --> 28:49.936
What do we do?

28:55.442 --> 28:57.235
We can stop working for Quino.

28:57.902 --> 28:58.737
He's our boss,

28:59.362 --> 29:00.655
but he's not the man.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.117
Right now, the man...

29:04.576 --> 29:05.410
is Damaso.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.412
According to Mr. Joaquin, he's in charge.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.456
Everybody knows it.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.376
DAMASO'S DISTRIBUTION HOUSE
CULIACAN, MEXICO

29:13.585 --> 29:14.502
It's not that easy.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.629
Either way,

29:17.130 --> 29:18.298
Quino is Joaquin's son.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.552
If they come to work with me,
there could be issues.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.143
With all due respect, boss,

29:31.519 --> 29:34.022
Mr. Joaquin himself would understand
that this tax is unfair.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.025
We come to you as the boss
of the organization to help us.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.903
With you, all deals
have always been respected.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.113
Whatever you say,

29:42.739 --> 29:44.157
Mr. Quino will obey.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.951
Mr Quino is harming the business.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.542
If there is something Joaquin always
wanted for the organization,

29:56.377 --> 29:57.253
it was union,

29:58.880 --> 30:00.340
harmony and profits for all.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.510
They can come to work with me
and buy in my houses.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.846
I will talk with Quino
and make him understand.

30:16.731 --> 30:17.607
Nothing?

30:23.696 --> 30:24.572
Hello.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.742
Sir, we have a problem.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.329
Meet me at the southern exit.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.958
Let's give Damaso
a hit that he'll never forget.

30:54.978 --> 30:59.357
DAMASO'S SECURITY HOUSE
MARIJUANA FIELD, QUILA, MEXICO

31:35.184 --> 31:37.979
As you may already know,
these lands were originally from my dad.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.023
He bought them and worked them.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.233
The issue is not with you,

31:42.859 --> 31:44.569
I just came to recover
what belongs to me.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.821
From now on, you won't answer to Damaso,

31:47.447 --> 31:48.323
but to me.

31:49.866 --> 31:50.783
Come on, get to work!

31:51.034 --> 31:52.327
Move it.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.081
What do we do, sir?

31:58.249 --> 31:59.417
Do we go back to Culiacan?

32:00.001 --> 32:00.835
No.

32:01.836 --> 32:02.879
We're staying here.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.465
This place is now ours,
we have to defend it.

32:06.674 --> 32:07.967
Bad news has wings,

32:09.719 --> 32:10.720
Damaso is about to arrive.

32:31.950 --> 32:32.784
Don't shoot.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.078
Move it.

32:35.703 --> 32:36.955
I don't want any problems with you.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.248
You should've thought about that
before stealing my people in Culiacan.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.376
You can't change the way
in which the organization works

32:41.459 --> 32:43.044
without consulting me,

32:43.920 --> 32:44.921
since I'm the boss.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.341
That tax was unfair.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.094
That's why your dealers work with me.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.929
Oh, really? That's why your people in here
work for me.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.723
This territory is mine.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.810
Your dad gave me these lands.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.646
You can't come and take them.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.148
From now on, they belong to me.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.734
And of you don't go,
I'll ask my men to shoot you.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.277
No one will shoot in here, Quino.

33:08.903 --> 33:10.697
You know that if you shoot
there won't be a way back.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.950
You will start a problem
you'll never get out of.

33:14.617 --> 33:17.036
Everybody will be over you and not even
your dad will be able to help you.

33:19.038 --> 33:19.914
Think about that.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.460
You were always cocky
but never stupid!

33:27.130 --> 33:28.089
Don't start a war.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.609
Gather the people.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.654
For when?

33:52.321 --> 33:53.281
For tomorrow.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.534
Fuck Damaso, he can go fuck himself.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.746
If they come and mess with us,
we'll take it.

34:00.621 --> 34:01.748
War is what he fears,

34:02.749 --> 34:04.083
and war is what he'll have.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.108
Bad news?

34:30.485 --> 34:32.195
Issues between Quino and Damaso.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.698
They both say you gave them the power.

34:37.366 --> 34:40.119
That you named them leaders
of the organization in your absence.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.497
But the situation got out of control.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.291
There have already been deaths.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.498
Ask Ismael to talk with them

35:25.581 --> 35:27.333
and to tell them to stop fucking around.

35:27.959 --> 35:28.876
The power is mine.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.503
I am the only boss.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.547
That must be made clear to them.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.009
Also advise him that he can already
tell them I will get out.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.805
And that they better calm down
until I get back.

35:41.889 --> 35:42.932
Once I'm out...

35:43.516 --> 35:44.892
I'll fix this myself.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.361
Joaquin is going to escape.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.239
-When?
-Why didn't we know anything?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.658
That's what your father wants.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.119
But now he wants you to know.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.205
He also wants you to know that
once he's out,

36:06.289 --> 36:07.915
he will take care
of the conflict you have.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.959
My people are really upset, Ismael.

36:10.668 --> 36:11.961
I don't know how long they can wait.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.255
I am also holding my men back.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.215
If Quino doesn't accept
that he attacked my territory...

36:16.299 --> 36:17.175
What will you do, fucker?

36:17.383 --> 36:18.259
Calm down.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.558
We're too grown
for this bullshit, aren't we?

36:29.812 --> 36:31.189
Quino, you're not a kid anymore.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.401
Joaquin also wants to make it very clear

36:35.484 --> 36:36.903
that he continues to be the only boss,

36:37.069 --> 36:38.154
and that you're under his command.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.573
You both are causing a crisis

36:40.656 --> 36:43.159
that any of our enemies
can take advantage of.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.494
We have to be able

36:45.578 --> 36:47.496
to control our own territory.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.422
If you want to keep

36:56.505 --> 36:57.757
being part of this organization,

36:57.840 --> 36:59.550
you will have to learn
how to live in peace.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.719
If not, you're free to go
and you'll be out of the business.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.389
What's your choice?

38:03.239 --> 38:04.407
Sir.

38:05.992 --> 38:06.867
Tell my friend

38:06.951 --> 38:08.536
that he will have to hurry
with the tunnel.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.664
If not, by the time he gets out...

38:12.665 --> 38:14.333
the issue between Damaso and Quino

38:14.417 --> 38:16.585
will have destroyed
the organization forever.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.300
Thanks.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.552
Do as Ismael says.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.680
Have them work 24 hours a day
with twice as many people.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.348
Don't let them stop.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.516
Never.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.292
The situation
got out of control,

38:56.625 --> 38:57.543
there have already been deaths.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.753
Is Quino all right?

38:58.836 --> 39:00.129
He will have to hurry
with the tunnel thing.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.589
If you don't do something,

39:01.797 --> 39:02.882
it will be a damn mess.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.327
