WEBVTT

00:00.996 --> 00:02.356
Agh!

00:06.099 --> 00:07.250
Agh!

00:07.338 --> 00:09.601
Are you sure you don't
want any help with that?

00:10.005 --> 00:12.056
I fit my high school best
friend into a suitcase

00:12.144 --> 00:14.272
way smaller than this when
we were crossing the border

00:14.360 --> 00:15.512
between Laos and Vietnam,

00:15.600 --> 00:18.204
so I'm pretty sure
I can figure this out.

00:18.478 --> 00:21.350
Ooh, I can't wait to get
to the Galapagos and like,

00:21.437 --> 00:23.491
breathe the sea air
and get my...

00:23.579 --> 00:24.554
Beach curls back.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.668
Yeah, you've mentioned that
a couple times.

00:27.146 --> 00:28.749
Are you still trying
to close that thing?

00:28.836 --> 00:30.474
- Agh!
- Boys, it looks like

00:30.562 --> 00:33.143
I won't be able to see that
wedding venue with you today,

00:33.231 --> 00:34.755
your mother's had a bit
of a relapse.

00:34.915 --> 00:36.800
Take it the "Crows" movie
is still shelved.

00:36.887 --> 00:38.862
I'm sorry, we've started
looking at wedding venues

00:38.950 --> 00:40.586
and no one chose to tell me?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.535
Touring a wedding venue is
an incredibly intimate thing

00:43.623 --> 00:45.069
and we wanted to keep it small.

00:45.157 --> 00:46.300
You invited Dad.

00:46.388 --> 00:49.260
Okay, I don't know what that's
supposed to mean, Alexis.

00:49.348 --> 00:50.828
<i>John, something's
happening!</i>

00:50.916 --> 00:53.917
Coming, Moira.
Don't make any sudden moves.

00:54.499 --> 00:56.168
Okay, you should probably
stay here.

00:56.255 --> 00:57.604
No, you shouldn't-
Okay.

01:00.164 --> 01:03.739
John, remind me
to reprimand that latch,

01:03.827 --> 01:05.869
it's been awfully moody today.

01:05.957 --> 01:08.362
Well, good-good morning,
Sweetheart.

01:08.481 --> 01:10.268
Look who's come to see you.

01:10.356 --> 01:13.925
Finally. I'll have
the continental breakfast

01:14.012 --> 01:16.997
with the fresh-squeezed
grapefruit juice.

01:17.085 --> 01:18.850
Orange Pekoe tea.

01:18.938 --> 01:21.636
No, Moira, Moira,
it's-it's David and Patrick.

01:21.717 --> 01:23.458
- Um?
- Don't we have something

01:23.547 --> 01:24.959
- we want to say?
- Yes,

01:25.047 --> 01:26.485
thank you, John.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.814
Sadly, I won't be able
to squire you

01:29.902 --> 01:33.073
for today's wedding venue
peregrination.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.585
You invited Mom?

01:34.734 --> 01:37.215
She's literally been asleep
in a closet for a week.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.218
Just know that missing this

01:39.306 --> 01:42.593
will be the heavy-hearted
part of my day.

01:42.681 --> 01:44.616
Okay, does nobody care
that I'm going to be gone

01:44.704 --> 01:45.803
- for six months?
- Yes,

01:45.900 --> 01:47.299
of course we care,
Honey.

01:47.387 --> 01:49.536
- Don't we, Moira?
- Take me with you.

01:49.624 --> 01:50.778
Okay. On that note,

01:50.866 --> 01:52.532
I think we should get you
out of the room.

01:52.620 --> 01:53.900
Alexis, you are more than
welcome

01:54.005 --> 01:56.902
- to come see the place with us.
- Thank you.

01:56.990 --> 01:58.697
That actually works out super
well for me

01:58.785 --> 02:00.015
because you guys
can just drive me, straight

02:00.103 --> 02:02.692
to the airport after.
Hm-hm-hm.

02:03.902 --> 02:05.584
- See what you've done there?
- Yeah.

02:05.672 --> 02:07.691
Mhmm.
Out. Out, out, out.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.562

02:16.114 --> 02:19.442
<i>John! Can you turn off your
alarm?</i>

02:21.366 --> 02:25.106
<i>David! I've asked you
not to over indulge</i>

02:25.194 --> 02:26.607
in that smoky cologne,

02:26.695 --> 02:29.306
<i>it's enough to give someone
a seizure!</i>

02:30.963 --> 02:32.878
<i>Is someone vaping?</i>

02:34.329 --> 02:36.147
<i>Oh no, not now!</i>

02:36.235 --> 02:37.317
<i>Help!</i>

02:37.417 --> 02:38.766
<i>Alexis!</i>

02:38.854 --> 02:41.978
<i>No, this is not,
this is not how I go!</i>

02:42.066 --> 02:43.790
<i>Somebody help!</i>

02:43.878 --> 02:44.990
Moira!

02:45.078 --> 02:46.754
Oh, Stevie, thank God.

02:46.897 --> 02:49.528
I'm being annulled by
a chancy door clasp!

02:49.616 --> 02:51.396
Okay, hang on.

02:51.483 --> 02:52.484
Ahhh!

02:52.571 --> 02:53.834
Okay, all right,
all right, okay.

02:53.921 --> 02:55.717
Up, up. There we go.

02:55.891 --> 02:58.663
Jeez, Moira,
I wait 'til at least 10:30

02:58.751 --> 02:59.893
before I have my first beer.

02:59.981 --> 03:03.097
Oh, my legs are in slumber.
Carry me.

03:03.185 --> 03:04.457
Oh I can't...

03:04.742 --> 03:06.608
Oh jeez, okay.
Hang on.

03:07.929 --> 03:10.556
You know, Moira, if Johnny
locked you in that closet,

03:10.644 --> 03:12.440
we're going to have
to call the police.

03:12.574 --> 03:15.220
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
My babies...

03:15.308 --> 03:16.912
- No, your kids aren't here.
- My girls.

03:17.000 --> 03:17.901
- What girls?
- My girls.

03:17.988 --> 03:20.019
Lorna, second from the left.
Okay.

03:20.107 --> 03:22.346
If she takes on smoke,
she'll never recover.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.841
- Okay, this? This one?
- And Cindy!

03:24.929 --> 03:28.243
Cindy, below her. Cindy,
I just gave her a blowout.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.684 --> 03:43.448
Wow.
This place looks nice.

03:43.536 --> 03:45.228
Yeah, it's the only venue
for miles

03:45.316 --> 03:46.477
that doesn't look like
a crime scene

03:46.564 --> 03:48.676
from a missing person
docu-series.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.924
Uh, so no one thought
to tell me

03:51.020 --> 03:52.617
I still have my show
makeup on?

03:53.220 --> 03:54.994
I thought that was a choice.

03:55.096 --> 03:57.233
Yeah, I left Stevie
double-fisting drinks

03:57.321 --> 03:59.870
in a hot tub at the cabaret
wrap party last night.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.541
I think I saw you
triple-fisting at one point.

04:01.628 --> 04:06.067
Ah, welcome
to Elmbridge Manor,

04:06.155 --> 04:09.198
and you must be the happy
couple.

04:09.596 --> 04:11.026
- Oh no, not quite.
- God, no.

04:11.123 --> 04:14.204
Oh, ladies, I'm so sorry.
Congratulations.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.158
- Champagne? - Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

04:16.245 --> 04:17.380
Mhmm, hi.

04:17.976 --> 04:19.916
David Rose.
I'm the one getting married

04:20.320 --> 04:21.663
and this is my partner,
Patrick.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.491
- Hi.
- So.

04:22.579 --> 04:24.873
Gentlemen,
please forgive me.

04:24.961 --> 04:26.161
I looked at your friend's face

04:26.248 --> 04:28.576
and thought someone had just
come from her make up trial.

04:28.996 --> 04:32.024
Now, if our grooms and the...

04:32.112 --> 04:35.782
uh, other couple
would like to follow me,

04:35.870 --> 04:38.069
I will begin our tour.
Wonderful.

04:39.881 --> 04:41.263
You look great.

04:43.290 --> 04:45.729
All of our catering
is provided

04:45.817 --> 04:47.727
by the neighbouring farm.

04:47.814 --> 04:51.600
We have fresh cheeses,
breads, meats.

04:51.687 --> 04:55.310
Oh, now I do apologize
if the peonies back there

04:55.398 --> 04:57.177
were a little overwhelming,

04:57.265 --> 05:00.109
it rained last night
and they just bloomed.

05:04.961 --> 05:06.314
It's perfect.

05:07.331 --> 05:09.546
David, I know you've made me
relinquish most,

05:09.634 --> 05:11.835
if not all of the wedding
planning to you at this point,

05:11.923 --> 05:13.448
but for what it's worth,

05:13.901 --> 05:15.842
this place is beautiful.

05:17.082 --> 05:18.997
- I think this is it.
- Mhmm.

05:20.230 --> 05:22.502
I think this is it, guys!

05:22.590 --> 05:23.632
See, David?

05:23.719 --> 05:25.765
Imagine if I wasn't here
for this moment.

05:25.853 --> 05:28.135
Mhmm, okay.
Glad you're here.

05:28.443 --> 05:30.358
So, do we have a winner?

05:31.603 --> 05:33.117
If you're happy,
I'm happy.

05:35.055 --> 05:36.638
We have a winner, Clive!

05:36.786 --> 05:38.027
Yes!

05:40.461 --> 05:42.115
It's a hell of a story,
Johnny.

05:42.203 --> 05:44.024
So I'm next door,
I'm cleaning the bathroom

05:44.112 --> 05:45.138
and I want a snack.

05:45.226 --> 05:47.607
So I grab some of those jail
time toaster pops

05:47.695 --> 05:48.934
and I put them
in the toaster,

05:49.022 --> 05:51.264
- and suddenly there's a fire.
- Oh, Roland.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.185
Why do they call them toaster
pops

05:53.273 --> 05:55.924
if it says on the box,
"Do not toast"?

05:56.012 --> 05:58.014
How mercurial is life?

05:58.841 --> 06:01.415
We all imagine being
carried from the ashes

06:01.503 --> 06:02.627
by the Goddess Artemis

06:02.714 --> 06:06.573
and here I get a balatron
from Barnum and Bailey.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.547
Okay. I...
I have no idea what that means,

06:09.634 --> 06:11.029
but it doesn't sound good.

06:11.117 --> 06:12.985
Okay, I'm gonna
go to lunch.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.725
Gotta get this burnt toaster
pop taste out of my mouth.

06:16.813 --> 06:18.267
Excuse me.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.367
Moira. I'm just glad
you're okay.

06:21.455 --> 06:22.386
Hm.

06:22.473 --> 06:23.344
And first thing
in the morning,

06:23.432 --> 06:25.760
I'm going in and I'm fixing
these latches.

06:25.912 --> 06:27.130
No need, John.

06:27.217 --> 06:29.049
I have been gifted
a smoke signal

06:29.137 --> 06:32.386
and you will never again find
me back in the closet.

06:32.632 --> 06:35.486
Well, why don't we take
this one step at a time?

06:35.573 --> 06:38.033
This may come as a shock
to you, dear, but...

06:39.305 --> 06:42.491
I don't believe my career
has been that kind to me.

06:43.439 --> 06:45.322
- What?
- I all but perished

06:45.409 --> 06:47.321
in the name of an unrequited
love

06:47.409 --> 06:51.795
for an industry that has burned
me over and over again.

06:51.883 --> 06:54.766
It's been difficult watching
you go through this, Moira.

06:54.853 --> 06:57.650
I know you'll want to fight
me tooth and nail, John.

06:59.505 --> 07:02.965
It's time my career
took its final bow.

07:06.030 --> 07:07.717
Now, if, if...

07:08.081 --> 07:11.672
if that's what you want,
Moira,

07:11.760 --> 07:15.359
just know that I'm here
if you need me for anything.

07:15.447 --> 07:17.704
Oh, I have never
needed less.

07:18.593 --> 07:20.739
Shall we take lunch outside
today?

07:21.532 --> 07:24.567
- What a great idea.
- Lay a blanket somewhere!

07:24.655 --> 07:25.973
If you're feeling up for it,

07:26.061 --> 07:28.157
I mean I, I, I know you're
still a bit shaken.

07:28.245 --> 07:31.805
That's just it, John,
I have never felt more lucid.

07:31.988 --> 07:33.292
I'll fix a basket.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.215
And I am including that
Peruvian ayahuasca retreat

07:36.303 --> 07:38.591
we embarked upon
with Al and Tipper.

07:39.267 --> 07:40.442
Okay.

07:48.277 --> 07:50.105
Okay, smiles over here please.

07:50.193 --> 07:51.993
Ted wants to know
what we're doing.

07:53.271 --> 07:56.219
Okay, like, a little less eager
and maybe one without Stevie.

07:56.307 --> 07:57.317
- No offense.
- All right. Alexis,

07:57.404 --> 07:58.523
could you put the phone down?
You're gonn be

07:58.610 --> 08:00.030
spending six
months with Ted,

08:00.118 --> 08:02.375
I think the two of you can
chill for a minute.

08:02.683 --> 08:06.172
Okay, this is our pricing
guide.

08:07.221 --> 08:10.678
Starting with our gold,
silver, and bronze packages.

08:10.765 --> 08:12.060
But, as you'll see,

08:12.148 --> 08:15.143
we can really accommodate
almost any request.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.859
- Are these in dollars?
- Hm.

08:18.896 --> 08:20.370
Okay, um...

08:21.075 --> 08:24.198
is there a package lower
than the bronze package?

08:24.301 --> 08:26.163
Perhaps a copper package?

08:27.569 --> 08:29.348
No, we can't accommodate that.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.493
Did you not ask to see
the prices in advance?

08:31.581 --> 08:32.831
They don't provide...

08:32.918 --> 08:35.052
We don't provide pricing
in advance.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.658
Well, now we know why.

08:36.856 --> 08:38.318
This might be the worst day
of my life.

08:38.405 --> 08:40.321
Okay, look.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.927
You're clearly
very desperate

08:43.015 --> 08:45.196
and I'm feeling terribly
for you.

08:45.284 --> 08:46.652
I don't love the way
you phrase that.

08:46.739 --> 08:51.227
Now, we did just have
a cancellation earlier

08:51.315 --> 08:54.064
in the week for a Sunday
afternoon.

08:54.190 --> 08:55.747
- Sundays are good.
- We can work with that.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.425
Now, the first Sunday
of every month

08:57.513 --> 08:58.645
is discounted already

08:58.733 --> 09:00.975
and we're unlikely
to find someone else

09:01.063 --> 09:02.161
this late in the game.

09:02.249 --> 09:06.339
So, I would be happy to offer
you an additional 30% off.

09:06.472 --> 09:08.039
Oh my God!

09:08.127 --> 09:11.870
Yes, but the only problem is:
it's a month from today.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.546
This is basically free!

09:14.634 --> 09:15.882
David, that's not enough time.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.153
We need to give people notice.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.106
Uh, I planned my ex
girlfriend's intervention

09:19.194 --> 09:20.275
in less than an hour.

09:20.363 --> 09:22.753
Plus, it'll weed out all
the dead weight.

09:22.864 --> 09:26.145
Um... I will not be here
in one month,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.886
so I guess that makes me
the dead weight?

09:31.214 --> 09:33.042
I'm feeling a little tension.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.356
We're gonna find another
venue, okay?

09:35.444 --> 09:36.975
We can't get married
without Alexis.

09:37.063 --> 09:39.485
Why? She's the one that can't
wait to get out of here.

09:39.573 --> 09:42.250
I once dated someone who left
me for a stuffed animal.

09:42.338 --> 09:44.466
- I'm not having my big day...
- Our...

09:44.554 --> 09:46.350
Our big day compromised

09:46.438 --> 09:50.417
because Alexis wanted to chill
in a tankini for six months.

09:53.985 --> 09:55.334
Honestly, David,

09:55.531 --> 09:57.403
if this is the kind of bride
you're going to be,

09:57.490 --> 10:00.388
I'm glad that I'm leaving.
Wha?

10:01.327 --> 10:03.772
And I would never
wear a tankini!

10:08.544 --> 10:10.285
Uh, just so you're aware,

10:10.373 --> 10:13.473
that is house made bacon
from the farm up the road.

10:14.070 --> 10:17.580
- Oh, give me this.
- Can... is that for everyone?

10:17.668 --> 10:19.147
- Oh, Please, please.
- Oh my God.

10:25.661 --> 10:27.813
Okay! God.

10:28.888 --> 10:30.944
Well, I guess congratulations
are in order.

10:31.032 --> 10:33.248
We didn't end up
taking the venue.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.205
Really? What stopped you?

10:36.293 --> 10:38.785
Did they like,
run out of sandwiches or...?

10:38.873 --> 10:41.046
Uh, yes.
But that's not why.

10:41.662 --> 10:45.277
We don't want to get married
without you here, okay?

10:45.626 --> 10:47.399
- And?
- And, David?

10:47.549 --> 10:51.053
And I didn't mean to make
you feel

10:51.141 --> 10:52.709
excluded from the day.

10:53.673 --> 10:55.327
Then again,
when all you talk about

10:55.415 --> 10:56.950
is how excited you are
to get out of here,

10:57.037 --> 10:58.932
I don't really feel like
including you in stuff.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.181
David, just say
you're sorry

11:00.269 --> 11:01.924
so we can get your sister
to the airport, okay?

11:02.011 --> 11:03.724
- Nevertheless...
- Mhmm.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.225
I might have overreacted

11:06.327 --> 11:08.720
- and for that, I am apologetic.
- Wow.

11:09.644 --> 11:11.153
So, you're sorry.

11:11.423 --> 11:13.156
I knew there was a reason
I came on this trip.

11:13.243 --> 11:14.458
My God.

11:14.546 --> 11:16.365
I am remorseful

11:16.643 --> 11:19.910
over an action
I participated in.

11:19.998 --> 11:21.290
- Hmm.
- Dammit!

11:21.378 --> 11:22.593
What is going on?

11:22.681 --> 11:24.089
- Car won't start.
- What?!

11:24.176 --> 11:25.843
Well, I can't be late
for my flight!

11:25.931 --> 11:27.329
Okay, well why don't you
go inside

11:27.417 --> 11:28.506
and ask Clive for help then?

11:28.593 --> 11:30.334
Because my feet
are killing me, David.

11:30.422 --> 11:32.428
- Oh my God!
- Why don't we go inside

11:32.575 --> 11:34.264
and see if there's anything
Clive can do, okay?

11:34.351 --> 11:36.482
Why do I feel like Clive
doesn't handle stress well?

11:37.116 --> 11:38.269
Come on.

11:38.435 --> 11:40.056
This might be a stupid
question,

11:40.144 --> 11:43.321
but why are you wearing high
heels on an airplane?

11:43.456 --> 11:45.022
Oh, I'm not wearing them on
the plane,

11:45.110 --> 11:47.151
they hand out slippers
with the mimosas.

11:47.397 --> 11:49.623
When was the last time
you flew economy?

11:49.711 --> 11:50.886
Hmm?

11:54.224 --> 11:58.079
Hard to believe this is our
first trip down to the creek.

11:58.915 --> 12:00.988
You know, Moira,
after the week we've had,

12:01.076 --> 12:03.637
this is the perfect way
to end it.

12:03.725 --> 12:06.424
To think I nearly made you
a widower.

12:06.732 --> 12:08.317
Oh, John,
I can just see you

12:08.405 --> 12:10.320
aimlessly wandering
through life.

12:10.408 --> 12:12.749
Stoic but stymied,

12:12.915 --> 12:15.744
not a friend in the world
and so very lost.

12:15.832 --> 12:17.597
Well, you're here now,
Moira,

12:17.685 --> 12:19.456
and... so am I.

12:19.589 --> 12:21.498
And, with your career
behind you,

12:21.586 --> 12:22.920
we'll be able to

12:23.072 --> 12:25.342
take advantage
of more days like this.

12:26.350 --> 12:28.812
Does this not remind you
of that wellness retreat

12:28.900 --> 12:30.337
we went to in Evian,

12:30.424 --> 12:33.209
right after Alexis ended
things with Sean Penn?

12:33.296 --> 12:36.552
Yes. You and I wandered down
to the lake,

12:36.664 --> 12:38.977
ne'ery a person to be found.

12:39.302 --> 12:40.978
Bid adieu to our clothing

12:41.066 --> 12:43.320
and let the cool sting
of the mineral water

12:43.408 --> 12:45.594
remind us that we were,
in fact,

12:45.904 --> 12:47.706
alive and well.

12:47.794 --> 12:50.495
I lost my Patek Philippe
in that lake,

12:50.781 --> 12:53.641
but I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

12:54.984 --> 12:57.152
We seem to have found
ourselves alone again,

12:57.240 --> 12:58.345
Mr. Rose.

12:58.617 --> 13:01.308
- Moira, that was 15 years ago!
- Mmhm?

13:01.396 --> 13:02.611
What if someone sees us?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.105
Who knows what will befall us
tomorrow, John?

13:05.193 --> 13:07.374
You could be hit
by a Mack truck,

13:07.461 --> 13:10.572
or bopped on the head by
a tiny piece of space debris!

13:10.660 --> 13:13.344
I don't know,
it feels risky.

13:13.432 --> 13:15.529
Let me just attend
to one thing first.

13:15.617 --> 13:17.475
Moira, whatever it is can
wait.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.146
No, no. Before we re-baptize
ourselves

13:20.234 --> 13:22.673
I'm going to call my agent
and make it official!

13:22.854 --> 13:25.047
Moira Rose is tech un-avail,

13:25.143 --> 13:27.184
she has a life to live.

13:27.272 --> 13:29.290
I'm proud of you,
Sweetheart.

13:30.886 --> 13:32.954
You just remove those
vetements, Mr. Rose,

13:33.049 --> 13:35.362
I'll be back in the shake
of a lamb's rump.

13:35.488 --> 13:37.982
As soon as I find a signal.

13:41.762 --> 13:46.880
Ugh! Ugh!
Uh! Like...

13:50.433 --> 13:53.390
- What's going on over there?
- I'm trying to check in!

13:53.478 --> 13:54.922
If we're going to be late,
I'm going to at least do

13:55.009 --> 13:56.581
everything I can
to not miss my flight,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.049
because I have never needed
a vacation more.

13:59.168 --> 14:00.431
Yeah, this?

14:00.543 --> 14:03.106
I think this is what might be
bothering your brother.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.030
Okay, I get it,
my life is an inconvenience.

14:06.491 --> 14:07.810
That. Um,

14:07.898 --> 14:09.958
or the fact that you've been
talking nonstop

14:10.045 --> 14:12.394
about how desperate
you are to get out of here?

14:13.181 --> 14:15.206
I think it might be hurting
his feelings.

14:15.385 --> 14:18.019
Okay. I'm moving to a place
that doesn't have a Sephora

14:18.107 --> 14:20.362
for literally 2700 miles,

14:20.450 --> 14:22.269
so I'm sorry if I'm trying
to convince myself

14:22.357 --> 14:23.772
that I'm doing
the right thing.

14:24.971 --> 14:26.843
I might still be
a bit boozy,

14:26.931 --> 14:29.238
- Yes, I can confirm that.
- But...

14:30.835 --> 14:33.742
I've actually been jealous
of your trip.

14:34.596 --> 14:37.396
Like, you're getting out there,

14:37.484 --> 14:38.811
seeing the world.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.639
And now that
Cabaret's over,

14:40.735 --> 14:44.254
I feel like I might need
to be doing more of that.

14:44.731 --> 14:46.780
I just wish I had your...

14:47.892 --> 14:49.482
what's going on?

14:49.579 --> 14:50.832
Because I think
I might be

14:50.920 --> 14:52.136
in the middle of giving you
a compliment

14:52.223 --> 14:53.509
- for the first time, so.
- Yes,

14:53.597 --> 14:55.258
and I am super touched,
it's just that

14:55.361 --> 14:57.330
I'm having trouble getting
my boarding pass.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.562
Like, do they not let people
in economy check in

14:59.650 --> 15:00.794
for the flight?

15:01.399 --> 15:02.662
Can I see your phone?

15:06.207 --> 15:09.406
Okay. Um, think I've found
the problem;

15:09.834 --> 15:12.271
your flight's not leaving
for another month.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.848
What?! Give me that!

15:15.151 --> 15:18.098
No, it says right here,
0-7-0-8.

15:18.186 --> 15:21.072
Yeah, but it's day before
month,

15:21.159 --> 15:23.772
so you're not leaving
on July 8th,

15:23.860 --> 15:25.800
you're leaving on August 7th.
What?

15:26.316 --> 15:27.338
Why it's so?

15:27.426 --> 15:30.802
Ugh, and my stupid ticket
doesn't allow for any changes.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.711
Ugh!
What am I supposed to do?

15:34.013 --> 15:35.854
Well, maybe you could start
by telling David

15:35.942 --> 15:38.176
that you messed up and he can
book the venue after all!

15:38.307 --> 15:40.434
Okay, I would literally
rather sleep at the airport

15:40.522 --> 15:42.118
- for a month.
- Yeah.

15:42.215 --> 15:43.651
Can you hear me now?

15:43.801 --> 15:45.804
No, I'm not blocking
the microphone

15:45.892 --> 15:47.585
with my finger anymore!

15:48.474 --> 15:49.954
Okay, no I was.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.131
Now... yes?

15:52.645 --> 15:54.790
Oh, well, what would the back
end look like

15:54.878 --> 15:56.023
on a deal like that?

15:56.642 --> 15:59.931
Oh, I see, what an emphatically
Kismetic

16:00.019 --> 16:01.767
turn of events.
Oh, John's here now.

16:01.926 --> 16:04.550
Okay, talk soon. Kisses!

16:05.967 --> 16:08.504
Johnathan, have we found
ourselves a new friend?

16:08.599 --> 16:09.926
- Hmm.
- Hello ma'am,

16:10.014 --> 16:11.260
I'm Officer Cornwall.

16:11.348 --> 16:13.397
I was off duty when I came
across this man

16:13.485 --> 16:16.075
in a state of undress,
down by the creek.

16:16.274 --> 16:17.975
He claims to be
your husband?

16:18.252 --> 16:19.563
Last I checked,

16:19.651 --> 16:21.580
a decades-long successful
marriage

16:21.668 --> 16:23.305
is not a criminal offence.

16:23.432 --> 16:24.832
No, no it is not.

16:25.093 --> 16:27.271
However, indecent exposure
certainly is.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.631
I found your husband sunning
himself in the creek,

16:30.719 --> 16:32.506
like he was in some
Grecian bath.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.711
No, I don't think we need
to editorialize.

16:34.798 --> 16:36.700
John, I'm so sorry,

16:36.788 --> 16:39.743
I was engrossed in a very
stirring phone call.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.913
Officer, perhaps we could
arrange a plea bargain?

16:43.001 --> 16:45.694
Well, since I wasn't supposed
to be fly fishing

16:45.782 --> 16:47.530
at this end of the creek...

16:48.483 --> 16:50.039
I think we can leave it
at a warning.

16:50.127 --> 16:51.162
Oh, thank you, Officer,

16:51.249 --> 16:53.519
for your almost militant
commitment

16:53.607 --> 16:55.819
to the protection
of our community.

16:55.906 --> 16:59.097
I promise to keep my husband
habilimented from now on.

17:02.793 --> 17:05.119
John, you won't believe
what's happened!

17:05.247 --> 17:08.178
What happened was,
you left me alone,

17:08.266 --> 17:10.053
struggling to get out
of a creek!

17:10.141 --> 17:11.561
The algae was so slippery,

17:11.650 --> 17:13.477
the cop had to throw me
his fishing line.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.386
Well, button back up your
birthday tux, John,

17:16.624 --> 17:18.406
because I've just found out
the "Crows" movie

17:18.493 --> 17:20.627
is back in business!

17:21.057 --> 17:22.106
What?

17:22.193 --> 17:25.045
Yes! Apparently it's been
picked up by Interflex,

17:25.133 --> 17:26.675
a brand new streaming service.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.526
Can you believe that?

17:28.684 --> 17:31.416
Moira, you were just saying
what a relief

17:31.520 --> 17:33.617
it was to have
the ups and downs of your career

17:33.705 --> 17:35.247
- behind you, and...
- I know, right?

17:35.436 --> 17:36.899
How serendipitous is this?

17:37.078 --> 17:39.528
At the precise moment I choose
to walk away,

17:39.616 --> 17:43.056
the industry comes crawling
back to me on all fours.

17:43.144 --> 17:45.693
I just worry about the next time
it's not great news.

17:45.781 --> 17:47.489
A new day has dawned.

17:47.823 --> 17:51.462
It took my accepting that
I could quit at any time

17:51.550 --> 17:54.466
to realize I musn't, John.
Ever.

17:56.150 --> 17:59.224
If this is what you
really want, then I'm...

18:00.231 --> 18:02.847
I'm happy for you.
Thank you, John.

18:03.769 --> 18:06.200
It appears officer fly fish has
taken his leave,

18:06.288 --> 18:07.638
how about that dip?

18:07.813 --> 18:10.331
Oh, I think the moment
has passed.

18:13.017 --> 18:14.367
Okay, roadside assistance

18:14.463 --> 18:16.117
isn't gonna be here
for the next hour,

18:16.204 --> 18:17.585
so we're going to call you
a cab.

18:17.673 --> 18:20.047
And Clive didn't have jumper
cables because he doesn't drive

18:20.135 --> 18:21.775
because he's scared
of car horns.

18:21.862 --> 18:23.170
Okay, um, David?

18:23.258 --> 18:26.236
I also have something that
I would like to say to you

18:26.324 --> 18:27.559
as well.

18:28.825 --> 18:30.209
Okay?

18:31.657 --> 18:33.615
I am sorry also,

18:33.924 --> 18:36.286
for rubbing my trip
in your face.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.163
The truth is,

18:38.727 --> 18:40.394
is that I'm really
gonna miss you.

18:42.803 --> 18:44.152
Thank you.

18:44.470 --> 18:46.705
I'm going to miss you,
as well.

18:48.366 --> 18:50.635
And I just feel so bad
about standing in the way

18:50.723 --> 18:52.806
- of your dream wedding.
- Oh...

18:53.243 --> 18:54.665
But maybe I should just, like,

18:54.831 --> 18:57.318
- push my trip back by a month.
- Wow.

18:57.406 --> 18:58.420
Okay.

18:58.557 --> 19:00.885
I am not having you push your
trip back.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.164
No, I insist.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.536
What's going on?

19:08.909 --> 19:11.085
Nothing, David,
just accept your wedding gift.

19:11.173 --> 19:12.668
- Patrick, call a cab, please.
- 'Kay.

19:12.756 --> 19:14.971
- Okay, no, don't call a cab!
- Ugh.

19:15.176 --> 19:17.958
- My flight got delayed.
- Delayed by a month?

19:18.046 --> 19:19.562
This is like watching
a car crash.

19:19.650 --> 19:20.398
Ugh.

19:20.485 --> 19:22.178
You mixed up the day and the
month on your ticket again,

19:22.265 --> 19:23.997
didn't you?
No! I... no.

19:24.085 --> 19:25.689
Like that time you showed up
to Kate Winslet's wedding

19:25.776 --> 19:26.361
a month late.

19:26.448 --> 19:28.024
The calligraphy
was hard to read

19:28.112 --> 19:29.897
and Billy Zane also did
the same thing, David.

19:29.984 --> 19:33.490
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, well the upside

19:33.578 --> 19:35.848
is that you guys can now
take the place,

19:35.936 --> 19:37.981
so actually,
you're welcome.

19:38.631 --> 19:39.983
She's right, David.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.433
We could go back
and talk to Clive.

19:44.923 --> 19:46.948
Do we go back
and talk to Clive?!

19:47.036 --> 19:48.383
Ew.

19:48.672 --> 19:50.572
- Oh my God.
- What is that?

19:50.660 --> 19:52.566
It's like a thousand
babies teething.

19:52.654 --> 19:54.497
Didn't he say there was
a farm up the road?

19:54.585 --> 19:55.651
Uh, that is correct.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.986
They process their pork

19:58.073 --> 19:59.511
on the first Sunday
of every month,

19:59.654 --> 20:01.222
hence our discounted rates.

20:01.309 --> 20:03.935
Did I hear that the wedding
was back on?

20:04.023 --> 20:05.667
Hey. This is not a winner,
Clive.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.986
Okay. I can't stop
hearing it!

20:11.365 --> 20:13.382
It sounded like a thousand
guinea pigs

20:13.470 --> 20:15.535
were being shoved into
a wood chipper.

20:15.623 --> 20:17.251
- Pork chops?
- Oh, no thank you.

20:17.339 --> 20:18.419
I'll have my later, thanks.

20:18.507 --> 20:19.893
Well, it sounds to me
like you two

20:19.980 --> 20:22.669
dodged a bacon-wrapped bullet.
I'll say it again:

20:22.757 --> 20:26.101
life is but a strand
of happy accidents.

20:26.189 --> 20:27.500
You've never said
that before.

20:27.588 --> 20:29.931
It's such great news
about the film, Mrs. Rose.

20:30.019 --> 20:31.053
Interflex is huge.

20:31.192 --> 20:33.194
Oh, wait 'til
our movie drops.

20:34.461 --> 20:36.525
So, I just talked to Ted.

20:36.613 --> 20:37.998
He's devastated,
obviously,

20:38.085 --> 20:40.226
but he did say that it's
probably for the best

20:40.314 --> 20:42.619
because he still hasn't
lizard-proofed his place

20:42.707 --> 20:45.312
and I have absolutely no desire
to be there until that happens.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.393
You see? Further proof
that life is but a...

20:47.481 --> 20:48.878
- Okay. We get it.
- Strand.

20:48.965 --> 20:51.373
Well, I, for one,
am happy to have you

20:51.461 --> 20:54.323
- for another month, Alexis. - Hey,
- <i>Thank you.</i>

20:54.411 --> 20:55.871
What if we got married
here?

20:55.959 --> 20:57.937
What if we got married
under a highway overpass?

20:58.025 --> 20:59.430
I'm serious.

20:59.518 --> 21:01.594
This place means something
to you guys.

21:01.766 --> 21:03.677
Put a tent in the back,
string up some lights.

21:03.765 --> 21:05.071
You could make it beautiful.

21:07.686 --> 21:09.761
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

21:09.887 --> 21:11.252
Oh, in other news:

21:11.340 --> 21:14.963
your father was arrested
for indecent exposure.

21:15.082 --> 21:16.933
- Ew, I'm eating!
- Moira.

21:17.021 --> 21:19.224
Okay. There's no backing out
now!
