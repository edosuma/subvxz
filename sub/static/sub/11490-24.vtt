A lone cowboy sits on a sturdy

01:01.333 --> 01:03.570
Didn't you move back to New
York with your husband?

01:03.590 --> 01:06.108
We did but then we split
up. Then I came back here.

01:06.128 --> 01:06.981
O I’m sorry to hear that.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.720
I mean, not that you moved back
here, but that it didn't work out.

So how is Charlie doing?

01:11.947 --> 01:15.086

fiancé moved in I assumed...

You look great Alan.

An unconventionally handsome man
pounds away at his lonely laptop,

01:56.196 --> 02:00.459
writing the summer blockbuster that will lift
him from poverty and put him in a home of his own.

02:03.539 --> 02:06.689
A beautiful woman crosses

02:27.785 --> 02:29.842
So, when do you think you'll be home?

But I was looking
forward having dinner with you.

Smack your kid for me.

02:56.997 --> 02:59.626
Should we really risk more brain damage?

03:00.589 --> 03:03.046
Thanks for sticking up for me, Dad.

03:03.498 --> 03:06.046
You'll never guess who I ran into.

03:15.546 --> 03:18.365
No, I ran into Mia at the coffee shop.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.311
You're kidding.

03:20.321 --> 03:23.581
No, uh, apparently, she's single
again and, uh, living in L.A.

03:23.591 --> 03:26.440
What's wrong with you?

03:28.958 --> 03:32.138
So... Mia. How did she look?

03:32.148 --> 03:33.733
Oh, better than ever.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.131
Damn.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.729
What did she say?

03:38.759 --> 03:41.317
Uh, she said to give you her best.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.464
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

03:43.815 --> 03:45.661
- How did she say it?
- What do you mean?

03:46.513 --> 03:50.446
I mean, was it perfunctory
or was there subtext?

03:50.456 --> 03:52.793
Perfunctory.

03:54.298 --> 03:57.809
That could be my rap
name. MC Perfunctory.

04:00.758 --> 04:02.845
I don't know.

04:02.855 --> 04:06.627
but I-I mentione that you were engaged,
and, uh, she seemed happy for you.

04:06.978 --> 04:10.268
You told her I was engaged?
Why the hell would you do that?

04:10.278 --> 04:12.856
Because you are, in fact, engaged.

04:12.876 --> 04:14.070
And she seemed happy about that?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.856
Yeah, she said, "Good for him."

04:15.866 --> 04:18.995
- How did she say it?
- Was it perfunctory?

04:20.350 --> 04:22.477
Or were there subtitles?

04:24.523 --> 04:26.559
I'm leaving.

04:26.569 --> 04:29.790
And yet the memory of him lingers on.

04:30.391 --> 04:31.886
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Yeah?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.541
Love you.

04:35.638 --> 04:38.868
To think I fought for shared custody.

04:39.249 --> 04:41.095
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so... so back to Mia.

04:41.105 --> 04:43.433
Oh, don't tell me you're
still carrying a torch for her.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.231
No, I'm not carrying a torch for her.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.819
Why, do you think she's
carrying a torch for me?

04:48.840 --> 04:51.528
Charlie, you are engaged
to a wonderful woman.

04:51.548 --> 04:52.822
Just forget about Mia.

04:52.852 --> 04:55.220
I had forgotten about her.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.500
I had forgotten about
her face... her eyes...

04:58.781 --> 05:02.442
her lips, her legs. Oh, God, those legs.

05:03.265 --> 05:05.221
You're the one who brought her up.

05:05.632 --> 05:09.886
Sorry. Look, I'm the last one to tell you
you can't have feelings for an old girlfriend.

05:09.896 --> 05:13.236
I mean, I myself still have
very strong feelings for Melissa.

05:13.608 --> 05:14.932
Who's Melissa?

05:14.952 --> 05:16.296
My receptionist.

05:16.306 --> 05:20.630
Oh, right. The one that
caught you in bed with her mom.

05:21.171 --> 05:24.943
Uh, you're leaving out a lot of
extenuating circumstances, but...

05:25.224 --> 05:27.852
yes, she caught me
rubbing against her mother.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.855
And you want to compare that
freak show to what Mia and I had?

05:32.226 --> 05:33.781
I almost married her.

05:33.831 --> 05:37.011
All I'm saying is, you can
acknowledge your feelings for Mia

05:37.021 --> 05:39.599
while still moving forward with Chelsea.

05:39.629 --> 05:41.255
That's exactly what I intend to do.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.020
- Good.
- It is good.

05:49.661 --> 05:52.028
You're thinking about
sex with Mia, aren't you?

05:53.162 --> 05:55.299
You're thinking about sex
with Melissa, aren't you?

05:55.329 --> 05:58.108
Trying to, but her mom keeps popping in.

06:09.283 --> 06:11.981
Okay, okay. I'm just going
to come out and say it.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.563
Baseball was better with steroids.

06:17.810 --> 06:22.063
I mean, this guy is leading
the league with 11 home runs.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.283
Back in Sammy Sosa's day,
that was a slow weekend.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.032
Call me crazy, but...

06:28.072 --> 06:33.329
I think people would pay real money to see
a meat-covered robot hit a ball 750 feet.

06:37.221 --> 06:40.782
Okay, well... Sportscenter is over.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.072
Time for sex.

06:45.136 --> 06:47.854
Charlie, please, this
report's due tomorrow.

06:48.536 --> 06:50.643
All right.

06:50.653 --> 06:55.398
I guess our relationship is getting to
that mature, evolved stage they tk about.

06:55.408 --> 06:58.127
- Guess so.
- Terrific.

06:58.899 --> 07:00.895
I hope I die soon.

07:00.905 --> 07:03.323
- What?
- Love you.

07:06.704 --> 07:09.111
Remember when you used to close the
door and tried to hit the porcelain

07:09.121 --> 07:10.797
so I didn't have to hear you pee?

07:10.837 --> 07:14.809
Yeah, way back when we used
to have sex after Sportscenter.

07:22.584 --> 07:25.874
Hello? Uh, hang on.

07:26.827 --> 07:29.546
Charlie, there's a woman
named Mia on the phone.

07:34.511 --> 07:36.838
- Should I take a message?
- No, no, no.

07:42.978 --> 07:44.994
Hello.

07:45.285 --> 07:48.114
Oh, hey, Mia. What a surprise.

07:48.606 --> 07:51.354
Yeah, Alan mentioned he ran into you.

07:51.685 --> 07:53.752
Old friend.

07:53.762 --> 07:56.681
Yes, yes, you heard correctly.

07:56.701 --> 08:00.322
I am engaged. Thank you.

08:01.065 --> 08:03.884
Yes, that was her.

08:03.904 --> 08:06.522
Oh, she's terrific.

08:08.468 --> 08:10.956
And how are you?

08:11.468 --> 08:14.216
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:14.226 --> 08:17.025
Well, there's plenty more fish in the s.

08:17.055 --> 08:21.519
And I'm sure you'll get out there in
that old dating pond and catch something.

08:23.947 --> 08:27.217
You know, a-a-a
fish, not a disease.

08:28.692 --> 08:31.661
Anyway, thanks for the
good wishes. Bye-bye.

08:37.871 --> 08:40.027
Okay, well, good night.

08:42.345 --> 08:44.762
- Old friend, huh?
- Yeah.

08:44.772 --> 08:48.544
She heard I was engaged and
wanted to congratulate me.

08:48.584 --> 08:50.099
Sweet kid.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.981
Is this the woman you almost
married in Vegas a few years ago?

08:56.580 --> 08:59.459
- Charlie?
- I'm thinking.

09:00.482 --> 09:02.438
Charlie.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.966
- Who told you about that?
- Your brother.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.584
Oh, really?

09:07.594 --> 09:11.446
Did he tell you his last girlfriend
caught him in bed with her mother?

09:11.667 --> 09:13.192
Yes, he did.

09:13.212 --> 09:15.319
What a dirtbag, huh?

09:18.609 --> 09:21.117
So, were you ever going
to tell me about Mia?

09:21.127 --> 09:23.504
What's the point?

09:23.514 --> 09:26.755
Have you told me about every
guy you've ever been with?

09:26.775 --> 09:27.958
Actually, I have.

09:27.999 --> 09:31.359
My boyfriend in high school, two
guys in college and the man I married.

09:31.399 --> 09:33.195
That's
it-- four?

09:33.215 --> 09:36.285
Back in your day, that
was a slow weekend, right?

09:38.482 --> 09:41.351
It's not a competition, Chels.

09:43.648 --> 09:47.279
So, why do you think this Mia is
calling you in the middle of the night?

09:47.610 --> 09:50.529
Honey, it was perfectly innocent.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.639
She just called to congratulate
me on our engagement.

09:59.247 --> 10:02.216
No, she didn't. She called
to see if you're happy.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.871
She wants to know if
you're still available.

10:03.881 --> 10:06.219
Really, you think so?

10:10.031 --> 10:12.509
I mean... Really, you think so?

10:12.519 --> 10:14.465
Yes, I think so.

10:14.495 --> 10:17.705
The question is:are you
happy? Are you available?

10:17.715 --> 10:20.424
Oh, come on, Chels. What
kind of question is that?

10:20.434 --> 10:23.784
No, I'm not available, and
I'm certainly not happy.

10:26.663 --> 10:29.602
- You know what I mean.
- I hope so.

10:30.014 --> 10:34.157
Yep. I'm a happy and lucky man.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.936
Happy, happy, happy.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.383
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.610
And wet.

10:45.894 --> 10:48.402
I'm kind of wet.

10:53.177 --> 10:54.972
What you writing?

10:55.012 --> 10:57.009
- A screenplay.
- Cool.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.978
Hey, I got a great idea
for a movie if you want it.

10:59.988 --> 11:02.045
Thanks--
I'm okay.

11:05.295 --> 11:07.321
What is it?

11:07.331 --> 11:11.916
Okay. So there's this guy wh on the highway,
where he hits like a moose or something.

11:11.926 --> 11:15.848
And he loses control of his car and
crashes into a truck full of toxic waste.

11:15.858 --> 11:19.811
And wh he kes up in the hospital,
he's part car anpart animal.

11:21.857 --> 11:24.214
Car-nimal.

11:25.970 --> 11:27.956
thanks, but think I'll
stick with my idea.

11:27.996 --> 11:30.534
- Fine-- what's your idea?
- You really interested?

11:30.544 --> 11:32.250
Sure.

11:32.260 --> 11:36.483
Well, it's, uh... it's about a man, uh,
who's at a crossroads in his life, uh,

11:36.493 --> 11:39.814
coming to terms with, uh,
loss and... and mortality.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.064
- You know what you could call it?
- What?

11:43.074 --> 11:45.441
Boring.

11:47.157 --> 11:48.140
Thank you.

11:48.150 --> 11:51.510
Rated G... A-Y.

11:58.332 --> 11:59.576
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Herb.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.950
I'm here to pick up Jake.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.876
Oh, come on in.

12:02.926 --> 12:06.247
Jake, time to get the
hell out of my house!

12:08.554 --> 12:09.517
So, how's it going?

12:09.547 --> 12:11.844
Oh, pretty good. Baby's
coming any day now.

12:11.854 --> 12:13.650
Judith's got that glow of motherhood.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.710
Gangway, I gotta freakin' pee again.

12:21.966 --> 12:24.484
Yeah, she's radiant.

12:25.638 --> 12:28.246
Hey, Herb. Jake's just
finishing breakfast.

12:28.256 --> 12:32.128
Or he could be starting
lunch. It's a fine line.

12:32.138 --> 12:33.914
Well, he is a growing boy.

12:33.934 --> 12:36.582
He's a growing pain in my ass.

12:37.555 --> 12:39.030
He says that with love.

12:39.050 --> 12:43.063
No, I say it with a dull,
throbbing pain in my ass.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.757
My water just broke.

12:47.778 --> 12:49.814
Are you sure?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.247
Yes, I'm sure.

12:59.525 --> 13:02.002
I ain't cleaning that up.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.961
Boy, this brings back memories, huh?

13:10.971 --> 13:13.318
Shut up.

13:13.729 --> 13:15.906
Slipping in Judith's amniotic fluid.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.203
Guess this'll be pretty funny someday.

13:18.735 --> 13:21.153
It's pretty funny right now, Herb.

13:21.524 --> 13:23.530
Hello? A little help here!

13:23.540 --> 13:24.513
Ding! Ding! Ding!

13:24.523 --> 13:27.001
Hold your horses, I'm...

13:29.088 --> 13:31.345
- Dr. Harper?
- Melissa, what are you doing here?

13:31.355 --> 13:32.528
I work here.

13:32.538 --> 13:36.551
I had to find another
job after... You know.

13:38.106 --> 13:42.068
For the last time, I did not
have sex with your mother!

13:42.079 --> 13:44.055
Excuse me, I'm having a baby here!

13:44.085 --> 13:45.359
Yeah, and I think I broke my ankle.

13:45.389 --> 13:48.077
- Quit whining, Herb!
- Her doctor's on his way.

13:48.087 --> 13:50.003
The contractions are
about eight minutes apart.

13:50.014 --> 13:51.267
Oh, well, let's get you to prenatal.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.856
I'll sign you in and have
an orderly take you upstairs.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.444
No. No, No, no. I'm
the father. I'll do it.

13:57.407 --> 13:58.530
Bad idea, Herb.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.128
I'm here, Judith. Everything's okay.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.412
God.

14:05.603 --> 14:07.779
My arm!

14:08.080 --> 14:10.538
I'm coming, Judith!

14:11.411 --> 14:14.691
Stay down, champ. It's not your night.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.373
Oh, my freaking God!

14:18.403 --> 14:21.051
Now, you're not breathing.
You got to remember to breathe.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.569
Good, good, good. Okay.

14:23.579 --> 14:25.957
Now, you're only two minutes apart.
So we're in the homestretch here.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.291
Great.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.755
Boy...

14:28.786 --> 14:32.919
It seems like just yesterday we were at this
same hospital waiting for little Jake to arrive.

14:34.694 --> 14:39.249
I guess after pushing out his enormous head, this
one will feel like spitting a watermelon seed.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.709
So anyway, I really love my fianc\e,

14:45.739 --> 14:51.036
but I can't get this
other girl out of my mind.

14:51.046 --> 14:54.537
I mean, she told my
brother to give me her best.

14:54.567 --> 14:58.850
And let me tell ya, her best could curl
your hair and make your ass whistle.

15:02.311 --> 15:05.712
Is that what you're here
for? A whistling ass?

15:06.795 --> 15:10.848
No-no, no. There's a baby and
some broken bones. Not important.

15:11.841 --> 15:17.910
The thing is, I know you can't expect to keep
the passion of a new relationship going forever,

15:17.920 --> 15:20.328
but I kind of miss it.

15:20.358 --> 15:24.150
Maybe it's just that the grass
always looks greener, you know?

15:24.762 --> 15:26.979
- You see this cooler?
- Yeah.

15:27.330 --> 15:31.493
It's carrying two light beers, a
half a ham sandwich and my thumb.

15:36.017 --> 15:41.023
So you'll excuse me if I lack a certain
degree of interest in your romantic dilemma.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.631
You got beer?

15:47.784 --> 15:49.199
- OhGod! Oh, God!
- Now, focus on me.

15:49.209 --> 15:54.285
Remember your breathing.
One, two, one, two, one...

15:54.295 --> 15:56.020
Dr. Harper?

15:57.445 --> 15:59.822
- Melissa.
- I miss you.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.738
Oh, I miss you, too.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.039
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

16:06.012 --> 16:08.158
Alan!

16:09.071 --> 16:11.419
You're fine. Just keep breathing.

16:12.803 --> 16:14.840
Hey, Charlie!

16:15.903 --> 16:19.835
Look at me. I'm half man, half machine.

16:21.621 --> 16:25.934
Kind of like Jake's
movie idea. Car-nimal!

16:27.479 --> 16:30.278
It's okay, dude. I'm going
to hang here for a while.

16:32.274 --> 16:34.461
I love that guy!

16:35.675 --> 16:37.952
What the hell did they give you?

16:37.972 --> 16:39.888
Oh, the good stuff.

16:39.908 --> 16:43.189
You could pull out every one of
my teeth, I wouldn't even notice.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.790
They didn't, did they?

16:50.401 --> 16:51.806
You're fine.

16:51.826 --> 16:53.923
Okay, then. Guess we should get going.

16:53.933 --> 16:56.511
You drive, okay? I'm pretty buzzed.

16:57.093 --> 16:58.206
What about Judith?

16:58.226 --> 17:00.694
No, let's not bring her. She's a downer.

17:02.660 --> 17:05.618
No argument, but there is the baby.

17:05.628 --> 17:08.288
Oh, my God... the baby!

17:08.869 --> 17:12.310
Judith needs me. I must go to her.

17:12.319 --> 17:16.743
I'm coming, Judith! I'm coming!

17:20.244 --> 17:23.054
Hey, Charlie, how'd
you get here so quick?

17:27.848 --> 17:33.256
Oh, I tried to forget you.
To hate you. But I couldn't.

17:33.557 --> 17:36.617
Really? Most people
don't have that problem.

17:39.887 --> 17:43.388
Beer and chips. This
is turning out okay.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.234
Did you see where my friend went?

17:48.254 --> 17:51.684
He went hobbling down the hall,
mumbling about some Judith.

17:52.316 --> 17:54.774
I better go warn the villagers.

17:55.918 --> 17:57.824
Good luck to you.

17:58.797 --> 18:00.643
Thanks. Oh, and hey.

18:08.427 --> 18:10.835
Good luck to you, too.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.626
God!

18:21.518 --> 18:24.177
Oh, there you are.

18:24.939 --> 18:26.263
You seen Herb?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.410
No, I haven't seen Herb!

18:29.915 --> 18:31.610
Chips?

18:31.630 --> 18:34.830
- No, I don't want any chips!
- Okay.

18:35.131 --> 18:37.629
I don't think you're
supposed to have beer.

18:37.639 --> 18:39.786
Get out of here!

18:39.796 --> 18:41.411
No problem.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.397
Wait! Don't leave me!

18:44.752 --> 18:47.922
I need someone to coach
me through my contractions.

18:47.932 --> 18:50.480
All right.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.635
Way to go.

19:03.972 --> 19:06.971
Judith! I'm coming!

19:08.657 --> 19:13.592
See, I love Chelsea, but you
know, there was a time I loved Mia.

19:17.755 --> 19:19.902
Breathe.

19:21.437 --> 19:24.015
All right, you're fully dilated.

19:24.045 --> 19:26.373
I think it's time to have this baby.

19:26.714 --> 19:28.891
Okay, well... good luck.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.378
Don't you dareeave me!

19:33.726 --> 19:35.802
Judith, I'm here!

19:38.350 --> 19:42.162
Whoopsie. Think I broke my nose.

19:43.406 --> 19:46.095
Three cheers for Demerol.

19:46.456 --> 19:49.796
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

19:54.912 --> 19:58.474
Interior-- hospital
delivery room. Day.

19:59.005 --> 20:03.199
An unconventionally handsome man looks
down upon the baby that might be his,

20:03.209 --> 20:05.777
but which he can never claim.

20:11.485 --> 20:16.270
Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky
and a flaming meteor plummets to the Earth.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.711
See, that's me holding the baby.

20:19.721 --> 20:21.637
That's me and the doctor.

20:21.647 --> 20:24.215
That's me, Judith and the baby.

20:24.827 --> 20:25.890
Who's that?

20:25.910 --> 20:28.899
Oh, that's just a guy who
got his thumb sewn back on.

20:28.909 --> 20:31.528
I can't get over how
into this baby you are.

20:31.558 --> 20:35.019
It was amazing. The miracle of birth.

20:35.029 --> 20:38.199
If Judith hadn't been there,
it would've been perfect.

20:38.650 --> 20:42.382
So you're not against maybe
having one of your own someday?

20:42.412 --> 20:43.987
I don't see why not.

20:44.027 --> 20:45.742
Turns out, I like babies.

20:45.773 --> 20:48.591
And as you know, I'm a
longtime fan of intercourse.

20:49.434 --> 20:52.343
I know. I got to get back to work.

20:52.353 --> 20:54.169
- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Love you.

20:54.179 --> 20:54.821
Love you, too.

20:54.831 --> 20:56.516
- Bye, Alan.
- Bye.

20:59.074 --> 21:01.131
- How's the screenplay coming?
- Great.

21:01.141 --> 21:02.917
Still on page one?

21:03.278 --> 21:05.665
Yeah, but now it really sizzles.

21:06.438 --> 21:08.193
Hi, Charlie.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.249
Mia.

21:14.242 --> 21:16.419
