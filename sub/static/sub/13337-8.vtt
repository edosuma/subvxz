WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.320
.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.680
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.040
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.880
(cheering)

00:15.960 --> 00:17.360
Come on!

00:18.800 --> 00:20.480
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:20.560 --> 00:22.240
Boat parties...

00:23.120 --> 00:24.160
More drama.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.880
Fuck this shit!

00:28.800 --> 00:30.520
More tashing on.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.280
More fucking tragedy.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.560
Slag!

00:36.640 --> 00:38.000
(shouting)

00:38.160 --> 00:39.600
(exhales heavily)

00:39.680 --> 00:42.160
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.360
(sobbing)

00:43.440 --> 00:45.400
(spits)

00:45.480 --> 00:46.920
Total carnage.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.800
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

00:55.120 --> 00:57.720
And a shitload of fucking, like.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.520
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.520
Scott doesn't give a fuck about me.
All he cares about is fanny.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.400
I cannae help but flirt

01:19.480 --> 01:22.520
with you, Chloe, so maybe
it's best that you stay away.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.920
Me and Kyle just
can't help ourselves.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.280
We're still flirting, having banter.
It's confusing for me.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.800
Cuddling up in the shag pad
will fuck with her emotions.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.480
It's gonna end up her crying.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.560
We cannot be arsed
with that any more.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.600
Kyle now wants to pull?
What the fuck?

01:47.560 --> 01:48.800
Here we go again.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.880
(Gaz) Holly and Kyle have ruined it
once again. I am done with them two.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.840
He's gonna kick off!
Who the fuck you talkin' to, man?

02:01.920 --> 02:04.560
This is fuckin' real, man.
This is fuckin' real!

02:04.640 --> 02:08.480
Aaron's furious and then Gary
started on Kyle. It's goin' off.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.680
This one relationship
has broke the whole family.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.200
(Gaz) We have tried
absolutely everything

02:17.280 --> 02:19.320
to make Holly and Kyle work.
We give up.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.680
One of yous is gonna have to go.
(scoffs)

02:24.920 --> 02:27.120
I'm absolutely devastated.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.360
Just feels like my family
is turning its back on us.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.720
(sobs)

02:32.800 --> 02:36.040
I feel like this is the end
and I'm completely broken because

02:36.120 --> 02:38.400
he didn't wanna be with us.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.440
I should have a degree
in pullin' women.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.400
I'd never kiss without a six-pack.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.280
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.480
Get in cos I'm gonna
tear the place up.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.640
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.680
I'm preened to perfection.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.000
I'm cheeky, colourful,
full of mischief.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.400
I'm fit and flirty.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.840
I'll make sparks fly,
get everyone feisty.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.640
(All) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:21.120 --> 03:23.160
(sobs)

03:23.240 --> 03:26.440
Now that he's gone,
I'm still gonna be heartbroken.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.600
I don't know what he's doin',
if he's OK and he's got no-one.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.040
(sobs heavily)

03:34.120 --> 03:37.040
'I don't even know what to say.
Holly is in tears.'

03:37.120 --> 03:39.600
Kyle is on a speedboat,
on the way to the beach

03:39.680 --> 03:41.920
and that's gonna be
the last we see of him.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.080
Oh, that was horrible.
That was so hard. So hard.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.080
I'm glad that Kyle's gone,
but I feel so bad for Holly.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.880
If I thought for one second
that he was good for her,

03:51.960 --> 03:53.880
I would put my hatred for him aside.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.360
Oh, God.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.840
Like, that was really fucking hard,
watchin' him drive off,

03:58.920 --> 04:03.600
even me who've fallen out with him.
I can't even imagine how you felt.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.520
I've been there for Kyle
from start to finish.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.480
All I ever wanted was to help him

04:11.560 --> 04:14.360
and he's brought all this
on himself by lyin'.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.560
This was for the best. It's clear
that Holly does love Kyle,

04:23.640 --> 04:25.960
but he's made her cry
every night for weeks.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.120
Tonight's gonna be a bit different.
We've lost Kyle,

04:36.200 --> 04:39.800
Gaz and Aaron have been grounded,
so it's just me and Turbo T.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.480
That, last night, for me,
seein' three of my mates fightin'

04:45.560 --> 04:47.760
in the fuckin' harbour there, mate,

04:47.840 --> 04:51.080
I was like, what the fuck are
yous doin' man? This is stupid.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.360
And for Kyle's sake as well,
he had to go.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.640
I know we've done the right thing.
It's a shame that someone had to go.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.280
And now the lads are goin' down
from five to four.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.360
Without bein' horrible, it will get
better. There won't be arguments.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.360
There's gonna be no more
Holly and Kyle, this and that.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.640
We won't be fallin' out with each
other cos they've had an argument.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.240
All that shit has now ended.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.200
Although it sounds awful,
I'm so glad that Kyle's gone

05:16.280 --> 05:19.200
cos now Holly can be herself
and get back to being happy.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.480
I don't wanna go out tonight.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.000
Like, I just feel like I just wanna
go to bed and just sleep it off.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.640
Today has been one of
the worst days of my life.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.080
I don't fancy tonight.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.280
To be honest, I don't think you
could have went out tonight.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.080
It's not right.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.680
Holly wants to stay in.
It's understandable.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.800
Us girls are happy to stay in,
but she doesn't want that.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.320
To be honest, I want you to go out
and have a good night, like.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.640
Yous can actually enjoy yourselves,
rather than thinkin' about me.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.200
So we're gonna go out
and try and have some fun.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.680
But at least the lads
are stayin' in as well,

05:56.760 --> 05:57.920
so I won't be on my own.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.240
Tonight I just wanna
have a good night,

06:06.320 --> 06:09.120
drama-free,
and I'm stayin' away from Scott.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.600
We get in the club and despite
only being a small squad,

06:14.680 --> 06:16.480
I'm out, so it's gonna be mint.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.200
I found a boy that I fancy,
so I'm gonna bring him over,

06:27.280 --> 06:30.360
get him a drink and put my tongue
straight in his mouth.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.560
Oh, my God, he's American! I've
never kissed an American before.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.200
Get in! Nathan's pulled
and he's canny fit. Yes, aye!

06:47.880 --> 06:51.280
I'm conqueror of the United States!
Buzzin'!

06:54.760 --> 06:56.720
Tonight just was a definite no-no,

06:56.800 --> 07:01.960
but obviously I still wanna
enjoy me time here.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.520
Cos of the fightin',
me and Aaron are grounded,

07:04.600 --> 07:06.080
but Holly's also stayed in.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.880
But I'm pleased because
Holly's not been funny.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.680
She knows that what happened
had to be done.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.120
Yous are my family,
have been since day one.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.400
I do need yous around us,
I do need your support.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.000
I thought once Kyle left,
Holly would go nuts.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.520
The fact that she hasn't proves
that we made the right decision.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.080
Now he's not here you'll be able
to slowly and surely get back.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.120
I want the Holly back
I used to know.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.160
Not the one I banged,
but the one I used to have fun with.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.840
I'm hopin' that now I can just
try and get back to bein' me.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.880
I'm just hopin' everything
the lads are sayin' is true,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.160
and one day I might
start havin' fun.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.480
Thanks, lads.
It's all right.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.680
I love yous.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.480
Chloe's arse looks like
expandin' foam in them shorts

07:56.560 --> 07:58.960
and it keeps on getting
bigger and bigger.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.760
Whoa! Your ass looks great, man.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.080
Oh, shit! Scott's come over,
he's been pretty flirty.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.560
There's only one thing
to do to get him off us.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.360
Go on, Chloe! Girl power!

08:16.360 --> 08:19.680
I'm proud. I feel like a new woman.
I played hard to get!

08:21.920 --> 08:24.880
Enough of this shit.
It's time to get down to business,

08:24.960 --> 08:27.320
get myself a buer.
Who wants a bit of Turbo?

08:29.320 --> 08:34.040
Scott's pulled again and it hurts us
when I see him with other girls.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.040
I wanna try and make Scott jealous.
I'm on the pull.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.680
I've spotted this lad,
all right-lookin'.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.840
I'll hit him with
me best chat-up line.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.760
He's dancin', ya fucker, it's
on point. Woo! You're mine tonight.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.000
At first, I thought
Chloe's guy was hot.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.960
Then he started dancin'
and I wish he fuckin' hadn't.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.640
He's just as bad as her.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.320
(Charlotte)Chloe's pulled. Buzzin'!
Go, Chloe!

09:08.400 --> 09:10.240
Go, Chloe! Go, Chloe!

09:12.040 --> 09:14.520
I'm necking on with this lad,
he's goin' for it.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.520
He's a big radger. I can't breathe!

09:19.200 --> 09:24.160
Oh, I'm so happy for Chloe. She's
pulled and now they're kissin'.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.320
Urgh! Are they kissin'?

09:29.600 --> 09:32.320
I have to give it to her,
the girl's got character.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.520
A fuckin' legend!

09:34.920 --> 09:37.720
Tonight has been mint,
but this lad is too keen.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.400
He's not goin' home with me.
See you later, pet!

09:41.120 --> 09:42.960
This bird cannot get enough of us.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.840
Don't worry, love,
there's plenty more to go around.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.400
I hope you realise
I've got infinity balls.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.280
Right, I'm a little bit
too drunk now.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.520
Can't stand up. Someone's
gonna have to take me home!

09:58.800 --> 10:00.000
Fuckin' hell!

10:06.760 --> 10:09.040
(Charlotte groans)
(thud)Ouch!

10:11.040 --> 10:13.800
Back on the boat,
there's nae messin' about.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.920
I'm straight in the shag pad, firin'
up all engines, cos it's dick ahoy!

10:27.240 --> 10:28.840
All Scott does is upset Chloe.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.400
The more he upsets her, the more
she likes him. I just don't get it.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.760
Nathan, I only did that
to piss him fuckin' off.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.640
I only did it to piss him off.
But it didn't work.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.800
I know it didn't.
I know this is hard,

10:44.880 --> 10:48.600
but yous two are not in a
relationship, nor have you been.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.680
It's time that you let this go.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.400
Why would he do this to us?!

10:52.480 --> 10:54.880
(mumbles incoherently)

10:54.960 --> 10:58.360
He don't flirt with us. He's
flirtin' with us, he's led us on.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.800
He's just... (mumbles) ...idiot!

11:00.880 --> 11:03.440
It hurts me to see Chloe
this upset by Scott.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.360
I know she can't help
how she feels,

11:05.440 --> 11:08.080
but no matter what,
I will always be there for her.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.720
I'm goin' to bed. I can't...
I'm sorry. I need to go fuckin' bed!

11:15.880 --> 11:17.360
Fuck's sake!

11:31.960 --> 11:34.760
Scott's in the next room
having sex with this girl.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.080
It makes us feel like absolute shit.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.200
I wish I could just turn
these feelings off, but I can't.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.920
(moaning)

11:45.040 --> 11:49.960
Oh, my God, I'm so fuckin' ugly!

11:50.040 --> 11:51.120
(sobs)

12:09.760 --> 12:12.880
Charlotte stayed in our bed
last night and pissed herself.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.800
What is wrong with that girl?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.280
(Both) Urgh!

12:20.520 --> 12:21.560
(Both) Urgh!

12:21.640 --> 12:26.160
Why am I still wakin' up in the same
bed, with Charlotte pissin' herself?

12:26.240 --> 12:28.040
When will life ever move on?

12:28.120 --> 12:29.360
All right?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.600
I wouldn't lie there
if I was you, mate.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.960
Oh, I just laid in the piss!

12:34.040 --> 12:35.520
(laughter)

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
What a fuckin' liberty!

12:37.680 --> 12:38.920
Straight in the piss!

12:43.320 --> 12:46.160
I've woken up and feel better
that I didn't go out,

12:46.240 --> 12:48.320
but I need to find out
what happened.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.120
Was it a good night?
It was.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.400
It was.
She pulled. I pulled.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.600
His dancin' was amazing.
Oh, was it?

12:54.680 --> 12:56.280
Yeah, it was as good as mine.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.320
It sounds like
they had a good night.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.840
I'm glad I didn't go cos I'd have
put a dampener on the situation.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.040
How you feelin' today
about Kyle not being here?

13:05.120 --> 13:07.880
It's just so weird.
I just can't believe he's gone.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.200
Everything's still so fresh
and new after last night.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.480
I know I'm supposed to try
and have fun,

13:14.680 --> 13:17.520
have a good time,
but I don't feel I'm up to it yet.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.280
I feel it'll get easier for you
that he's not here,

13:20.360 --> 13:23.240
easier for you to get over him.
We're all here for you.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.640
Yeah, it's still gonna be hard
knowing that he's not here,

13:26.720 --> 13:28.000
I don't know if he's OK.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.080
At the minute I've got everyone
and he's got no-one.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.880
I pulled, you pulled.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.200
And then you weren't happy.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.480
Last night, I was doin' so well.
I didn't flirt with Scott,

13:44.560 --> 13:47.200
but as soon as I seen him pull,
he made us so upset.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.360
I know you like him.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.440
Like, I could have easily
kicked off at him last night.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.120
Yeah, but over what, though?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.240
Cos he said, "Stop flirtin' with us,
just be friends."

13:56.320 --> 13:58.360
Straight away, flirtin'.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.760
Scott would flirt with
a fuckin' lamp post.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.560
Scott won't change.
He's like a horny gorilla!

14:04.640 --> 14:06.720
You pulled a lad.
I know.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.200
How did you feel about it?

14:08.280 --> 14:10.960
It's weird.
You know the girl I pulled in Zante?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.080
Yeah.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.880
She was better-looking than that
boy, but I enjoyed kissin' him more.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.840
Really? What does that mean?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.040
I dunno.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.880
Do you still like girls?

14:23.600 --> 14:24.720
Do you fancy girls?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.920
Chloe's askin' us
too many questions.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.160
I don't know.
I'm tryin' to figure it out.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.400
I'm confused.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.520
So am I.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.080
(horn blares)

14:34.160 --> 14:36.600
My fuckin' God, I just shit meself!

14:36.680 --> 14:39.200
Bastard!
I think I've followed through.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.360
(phone rings)

14:43.440 --> 14:45.720
(Gaz) Anna's ringing!
The phone's goin'.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.480
Yeah?

14:51.160 --> 14:52.520
Where is it?

14:54.680 --> 14:56.520
Mykonos?
(Scott)Sick!

14:56.600 --> 14:59.280
Anna tells us we're goin'
to Mykonos. Thank fuck.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.840
We need a change of scenery.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.440
Boys, boys, boys!

15:06.520 --> 15:09.600
Charlotte, we're goin' to Mykonos!
Buzzin'.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.880
Mykonos, here we come!

15:24.400 --> 15:28.560
Whoo! Mykonos! Oh, Mykonos!

15:34.880 --> 15:37.680
My nails are disgustin'.
I feel like a troll.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.320
Yeah, same, I do.
Shall we get them done?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.320
What better way to cheer Holly up

15:42.400 --> 15:45.640
than having some girl time
and a big pampering session?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.760
Hi.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.120
This is exactly what we need,
a little bit of girl time.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.600
I don't think there's been
much atmosphere.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.440
It's been hardly any arguments.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.720
Yeah, there's none of that any more,
but... I dunno.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.960
The atmosphere may have changed, but
I'd take arguments if he was here.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.880
We all miss him and want him back.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.320
He's the reason why I've had
most of the good times in here.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.400
(sighs)

16:14.480 --> 16:17.600
What?! I know this
must be tough for Holly,

16:17.680 --> 16:21.000
but he was also the reason
why she was so miserable.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.480
Why can't she see that Kyle
was an absolute dick to her?

16:24.560 --> 16:27.120
I can't believe
she's still sticking up for him.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.760
Sticking up for him after what he's
done. He totally mugged her off.

16:30.840 --> 16:35.320
Kyle finished Holly, then mugged her
off. I wish Holly could see that.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.120
We're gonna go pure hard,

16:51.200 --> 16:54.280
so I cannae wait to gan
fuckin' akka in this super-club.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.040
This is our first proper
night out in Mykonos.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.440
Kyle's not here, so should be
a little bit more drama-free.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.960
Aaron needs to pull.
That kid is havin' a fuckin' mare.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.600
He should sit in the corner,

17:07.680 --> 17:10.800
think about what he hasn't done,
cos he's done no-one.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.760
I've had that many thinkies,
I've out-thunk meself.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.720
Can't have any more wanks.
No more thinkin' there.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.600
I've a couple more in the barrel.
I've out-thunk me.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.280
I'm determined to look mint,

17:21.360 --> 17:24.440
so I can pull a fitty
and hopefully get back in the game.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.080
Since Kyle left
I haven't been drinking,

17:30.160 --> 17:31.880
because I don't wanna get upset.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.560
But tonight I feel strong enough,
so I'm goin' in.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.560
I feel so amazing with my new nails.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.720
I've matched everything to them.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.920
I think Scott will love my feet.
He will want a foot wank.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.400
You do it like this.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.440
You don't. You do it like this.
Do you know how?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.840
Aye, I've done one or two.
With those feet?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.960
I'm not just a pretty face,
I'm a woman of many talents.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.000
Oh, my gosh!
Yeah!

17:55.080 --> 17:56.960
That's unreal!

17:57.040 --> 18:00.600
I'd give Scott any kind of job.
Just call me the job centre.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.960
What if he tries to pull
someone tonight?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.200
Not gonna be arsed.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.120
That's a lie.
That's laughable.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.880
Tonight, I'm gonna play it cool
if Scott pulls

18:08.960 --> 18:12.200
and show I'm not a nutcase,
and then maybe he might marry us.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.760
No, that's goin' too far now.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.680
Boys, let's go.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.800
(whooping)

18:21.880 --> 18:25.400
It's Holly's first night out
since Kyle left and I'm hopin'

18:25.480 --> 18:29.080
she can start havin' fun
and forgettin' about him.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.720
We get in this club
and the tunes are goin' off.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.280
Exactly what my dick's gonna
be doin' in about 48 minutes.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.160
I'm just not havin'
a very good time.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.000
Emotions are all over the place.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.920
I am tryin' my best here.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.880
How can she get over Kyle if
she's just refusing to be involved?

19:04.680 --> 19:07.440
I get it's hard for Holly,
I totally understand,

19:07.520 --> 19:10.800
but I do feel she needs to at least
try and have some fun with us.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.800
Otherwise she's never
gonna be able to move on.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.600
Tonight, I am on the pull and
nothing and nobody is gonna stop me.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.240
Bye, girls.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.600
I just hope I don't fuck this up
and I manage to seal the deal.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.960
I've got this naughty bird
and cos I'm a mint wingman,

19:38.040 --> 19:39.800
I've got a pal for Aaron, too.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.280
That's Aaron.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.240
There you go, son, knock 'em dead.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.200
I've turned around and Scott's
pulled another girl.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.960
I'm not gonna kick off,
I'll try to have a good time.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.640
I can see Nathan talkin' to a lad,

20:00.720 --> 20:03.280
but he's been talkin'
for an awful long time.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.680
It's time for the wingman to step in.
Yous two, fuckin' kiss.

20:06.760 --> 20:11.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:12.800 --> 20:14.440
Gary, I have this by myself.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.360
I'm kissin' him
and it feels so fuckin' good.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.840
I wish no-one was around so I could
take it that little further.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.840
Marnie's lovin' my moves. I think
she's in a puddle right now.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.720
Three-way kiss, anyone?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.680
Holly is on her own,
cryin' her eyes out.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.440
So I'm gonna see if she's OK.

20:58.360 --> 21:02.440
I'm havin' such a bad time.
I can't dance, I can't drink anymore

21:02.520 --> 21:05.680
and I just can't have fun.
How am I gonna live without him?

21:09.960 --> 21:12.760
Holly needs to understand
that without Kyle here,

21:12.840 --> 21:16.240
she can start havin' fun and
enjoy Greece for the first time.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.640
It's killin' us to see
Holly cry like this.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.760
It's killin' us because
I've lost my best friend.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.200
She has completely and utterly
changed for a boy,

21:39.280 --> 21:42.600
and I feel like I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get her back.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.720
We get back to the boat
and King Nathan is back!

22:00.800 --> 22:02.720
Fuck me, I've got the Mykonos magic!

22:07.360 --> 22:08.760
That was good.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.040
The first thing I'm gonna do is
fuckin' nash as fast as I can

22:12.120 --> 22:13.240
to get that shag pad.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.480
We're back at the boat
and I need to speak to Holly.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.040
She needs to realise that
she's changed and we want her back.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.840
Because every single night out
I'm thinkin' about him.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.880
I... You've gotta understand
from my point of view

22:36.960 --> 22:38.920
that I cannot have a good night out.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.880
I can't just forget
everything that's happened.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.960
I know that this
must be hard for Holly,

22:45.040 --> 22:49.880
but Kyle was an absolute dick to her
and made all of us fall out.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.280
I can't just forget everything
that's happened.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.800
Holly, Holly, listen to us.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.640
I think it's about time that
we didn't sugar-coat things.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.480
I don't want it.
Holly, Holly...

23:01.560 --> 23:04.120
Charlotte, listen, I don't wanna.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.000
Come on, does it really look like

23:06.080 --> 23:09.000
I wanna be told how much of a mug
I know I am right now?

23:09.080 --> 23:10.480
This is not gonna help me.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.760
No, I know what yous think.
No, you don't, you don't.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.200
I do. I don't wanna listen.
Holly, you don't.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.120
I've heard it.
Doesn't matter. You need to listen.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.200
It's heartbreaking to see my friend
in this state, but why can't she see

23:23.280 --> 23:26.320
she's better off without Kyle?
He's not good for her.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.960
Holly, he's a fucking arsehole.
He's necked on with...

23:31.040 --> 23:34.440
Yes, I know! You don't fucking
think I know this?!

23:34.520 --> 23:35.520
No, listen!

23:35.600 --> 23:37.800
No, no, no, no! I just wanna go!

23:37.880 --> 23:38.960
Holly!

23:39.040 --> 23:43.440
(screaming)I know this! I know!

23:43.520 --> 23:46.160
And this is why I didn't wanna...
Fuck off!

23:47.200 --> 23:49.360
Don't wanna fuckin' do this, man!
Holly!

23:49.440 --> 23:53.000
Fuck off! I don't wanna listen to
it, Charlotte. I've listened...

23:53.080 --> 23:54.760
Fuck off! Not gonna listen!

23:54.840 --> 23:56.600
Holly! Holly!

23:56.680 --> 24:00.640
Guys, keep it down. Mans is trying
to get his fuckin' end away here.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.640
Holly, come here!
No!

24:02.720 --> 24:04.320
Holly! Hol!

24:04.400 --> 24:05.920
I don't want to be followed.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.120
Charlotte, I don't want to talk to
anyone. Just fuck off!

24:09.200 --> 24:10.200
(sobs)

24:10.280 --> 24:14.280
Listen. Listen to us, listen to me
right now, right? Hol? Listen.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.600
Cos I feel like I'm fuckin' wrong!

24:16.680 --> 24:20.360
She needs to listen. I'm only
doin' this to benefit her.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.960
We have sat for so long, we have
agreed and we have nodded with you

24:24.040 --> 24:27.360
about everything
you've had to say about Kyle.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.840
But listen...
She knows!

24:28.920 --> 24:32.120
Listen...
I know! I fucking know!

24:32.200 --> 24:34.800
I've seen it with me own
fuckin' eyes, Charlotte.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.760
In all the time I've known them,

24:36.840 --> 24:40.360
I've never seen them go in on
each other this much. This is bad.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.440
Listen...
She loves him regardless.

24:42.520 --> 24:48.480
You saw it, but until your best
friends tell you, it won't sink in.

24:48.560 --> 24:52.600
You saw it, you will never believe
it because you are in love with him.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.280
But listen to me, Holly, listen.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.920
He is an arsehole.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.520
I know everything
everybody is sayin' is true,

24:59.600 --> 25:02.200
but it's gonna take me
a long time to process it.

25:02.280 --> 25:07.200
All I want you to do is f...
fucking... forget about him!

25:07.280 --> 25:08.320
I can't.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.440
Listen. Hol, Hol, listen.
I can't!

25:11.520 --> 25:16.720
Listen, he has treated you like shit
from the minute you got with him.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.640
I'm so glad Charlotte's
sayin' what she's sayin'.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.520
Holly needs to hear it.
She needs to get over Kyle.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.960
(sobs)
He's treat you like shit.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.760
I've lost the person who I literally
love the most in this house.

25:28.840 --> 25:33.680
Holly needs to go back to
the person she was before Kyle.

25:33.760 --> 25:39.320
I don't see my Holly. I can't
see my Holly! I can't see her!

25:40.320 --> 25:45.200
I can't see her! I can't, because
you're trying to please Kyle.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.920
And you're not even with him, and
you're still tryin' to please him.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.600
Why is it so wrong to try and please
the person you're in love with?

25:53.680 --> 25:55.680
Because I'm sure that Charlotte has.

25:55.760 --> 26:00.280
You've been brainwashed. Listen,
listen, you need to listen to us.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.280
You have been brainwashed.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.080
She's been lied to,
she's been deceived,

26:05.160 --> 26:07.200
she's practically been cheated on.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.840
Don't you ever, ever
stick up for him!

26:10.920 --> 26:13.480
He never cared about you, Holly.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.280
He never did.

26:16.360 --> 26:20.680
What's so hard is I know everything
that everyone's sayin' is true,

26:20.760 --> 26:22.600
and maybe he wasn't in love with me,

26:22.680 --> 26:26.160
and for the past year he's just
been putting up this massive lie.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.600
(sobs)

26:32.760 --> 26:36.360
I know that everything I said to
Holly was probably so hard to hear,

26:36.440 --> 26:39.280
but I've had to hear it before
and it did me good.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.400
I just hope it does her good and
she doesn't hate us in the morning.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.120
Tonight has been absolutely awful.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.920
I didn't wanna hear
those things Charlotte said,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.560
but maybe I needed to
and they'll start to sink in

26:52.640 --> 26:54.040
and things can get better.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.000
Did you hear the girls' argument?

27:22.080 --> 27:24.600
When I first started
gettin' in the mix,

27:24.680 --> 27:26.880
I heard Charlotte
and Holly screaming.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.960
I'm so pleased I was tucked up
with my bird in the shag pad,

27:30.040 --> 27:33.560
away from all them arguments,
even though I could still hear them.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.120
I reckon Kyle could
and he's back in Newcastle.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.800
It's good riddance to Kyle.

27:41.880 --> 27:45.120
I did like the kid, but this house
is better off without him.

27:48.840 --> 27:52.520
Kyle, Kyle, give us a wave.
Kyle, Kyle, give us a wave.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.960
We do not wanna be
on this boat when it's like this.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.640
There's only one thing to do,
hit the beach.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.400
Although Charlotte and Holly had an
argument, Holly needs to understand

28:13.480 --> 28:16.480
it was from a good place.
Charlotte wanted to be honest.

28:26.080 --> 28:30.400
I said a lot of things to her and
I'm hopin' she's not angry at us.

28:30.480 --> 28:35.400
But she's still asleep, so I don't
know if things are OK between us.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.600
This is the pure perfect
lads' day out,

28:42.680 --> 28:45.960
hot weather, water sports
and spying birds in bikinis.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.840
I'm up first, doin' the jet boots.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.360
Oh, my God, I'm flyin'!
I'm like a real-life super-hero!

29:01.360 --> 29:02.920
Fuck, this is great!

29:03.000 --> 29:06.320
Not bad, Nathan, but step aside
and watch how the big boys do it.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.000
Gary you're gonna be shit
compared to me!

29:11.400 --> 29:13.880
Finally, summat Gary
isn't fucking good at!

29:19.640 --> 29:22.040
To a wicked day.
To a wicked day.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.160
Let's go back to the witches
on the boat fuckin' huffin'.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.720
I hope they're not in a mood
when we get back.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.280
I hope the girls have sorted out
their beef by the time we get back

29:31.360 --> 29:33.480
cos I don't want them
ruinin' my vibes.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.440
I think Holly needed
to hear what she heard.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.640
It was the best thing
that could happen.

29:38.720 --> 29:43.400
Now she's heard what Charlotte and us
really think, maybe she'll move on.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.560
At the end of the day,

29:44.640 --> 29:47.560
regardless of if they sorted
their issues out or not,

29:47.640 --> 29:50.960
we've had a fun day today so let's
bail and get back to the boat.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.040
(all)Howay!

29:53.040 --> 29:56.720
Good the girls stayed, so they can
sort their shit out and when we

29:56.800 --> 30:00.280
get back they're all in a good mood
and we'll all go nuts tonight.

30:04.840 --> 30:08.000
Holly's finally awake
and I've finally grown some balls.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.600
It's time to see if we're OK.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.240
How are you, then?

30:12.400 --> 30:14.680
Er, well, I still feel a bit shit.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.880
I feel you've been
a shadow of yourself.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.760
I realise that everybody
wants the old Holly back,

30:19.840 --> 30:23.120
but I can't click my fingers
and magically make her reappear.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.440
I'm goin' through a lot
and I'm hurting.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.280
They've gotta understand that.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.360
We want you to have fun with us.
So do I.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.200
Why don't you get involved
in mine and Marnie's fun?

30:32.280 --> 30:36.440
I tried. I can't get him
out of me head. I love him.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.600
I do hope that one day me and Kyle
can get back together,

30:42.680 --> 30:45.080
but that's something
I can't tell Charlotte

30:45.160 --> 30:46.920
because she won't wanna hear it.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.320
We've only got
a little time left here.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.760
From now on,
let's try and enjoy this.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.440
I get that Charlotte's
tryin' to look out for me

30:55.520 --> 30:57.800
and she's got
my best interests at heart.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.640
I feel I need to take it slowly and
get back to myself in my own time.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.440
OK.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.080
Hi, girls!
Hi.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.760
Hi. Are yous OK?
Hi. Uh-huh.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.080
Have you sorted things out?
(both)Yeah.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.280
We had a deep chat.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.120
I really just hope
me chat with Holly worked.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.120
I want her to be able to have
a laugh with the girls again.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.920
I'll try and have fun and forget.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.080
Aw!

31:31.160 --> 31:33.760
I'm happy!

31:33.840 --> 31:37.040
Holly is one of the strongest girls
I have ever met.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.080
Hopefully now she can go back
to the old Holly we loved.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.960
We should do something excitin'.
Like what?

31:43.040 --> 31:45.760
We've been on this boat
and haven't had a boat party.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.200
What's wrong with us?
I'm gonna change that.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.480
Fuck off!

31:53.560 --> 31:55.840
How have we never thought of this?

31:55.920 --> 31:59.600
Is Chloe really Albert Einstein?

31:59.680 --> 32:03.000
I've met a couple of boys here.
The lads have met loads of girls.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.800
Exactly.
Let's invite them all.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.640
We could dress as sailors.
Fuck!

32:06.720 --> 32:07.920
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

32:08.000 --> 32:11.520
A boat party is exactly what Holly
needs to get her back on track!

32:11.600 --> 32:15.280
Boat party bitches!
Boat party bitches!

32:20.040 --> 32:22.360
The girls clearly know me too well,

32:22.440 --> 32:25.920
and the best way to my heart
is with a fancy dress party.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.920
And, better yet, it's on the boat.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.880
Hi, boys.
Ahoy, sailors!

32:31.960 --> 32:36.000
Me and the girls are ready,
and shiver me timbers, we look mint!

32:36.080 --> 32:38.520
Why are you dressed like that?
Boat party.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
Yeah.
Shut up!

32:39.680 --> 32:40.960
We've a suit for yous,

32:41.040 --> 32:43.640
loads of drink
and we've invited people.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.800
A boat party?

32:44.880 --> 32:48.040
It looks like they've forgot
about last night. Wicked!

32:48.120 --> 32:50.200
You've got 20 minutes to get ready.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.120
Boat party bitches!
Boat party bitches!

32:56.640 --> 32:59.680
I am so pleased we're givin'
this boat a good send-off.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.600
Welcome to the party boat!
What's your name?

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
Sean.
Sean.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.720
Simon? Get in the back and Chloe
will give you a blow job!

33:11.200 --> 33:14.280
Everyone looks wicked.
Time to get this party started.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.920
The main thing is makin' sure
Holly has a good time.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.680
So that means none of the lads will
be pullin'. It's a family night.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.840
I'm checkin' on Holly to make sure
she's still havin' a good time.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.320
Don't want her to think
we've neglected her.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.600
(Holly) I know.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.360
It's so nice to see that
Scott and the boys do care

33:51.440 --> 33:53.720
and they're makin' an effort
with Holly.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.240
Boat party bitches!
Boat party bitches!

34:06.600 --> 34:10.400
Everybody! (whistles) The boat party
has officially finished.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.560
Everyone go home, get ready,
we will see you in the club!

34:15.400 --> 34:16.720
Bye!

34:22.560 --> 34:26.040
Boat party, done. Now it's
time to get worselves ready,

34:26.120 --> 34:29.880
go out and smash Mykonos for
the last time. Fuckin' come on!

34:29.960 --> 34:33.600
The super-club is gonna be
super-fine, I can just tell.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.240
Yeah, it's gonna be so super.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.080
And then we can come back
and be a human super-spoon!

34:38.160 --> 34:40.080
Yes. I like the sound of that.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.360
It was so good to see everyone
pay Holly loads of attention

34:43.440 --> 34:45.560
at the boat party.
And to end the night,

34:45.640 --> 34:48.080
we're all gonna have
a big family cuddle.

34:48.160 --> 34:51.240
Maybe we should all sleep in here?
I could probably, like,

34:51.320 --> 34:55.360
at the end of the night cuddle Gary
and like spoon him and... (mumbles).

34:55.440 --> 35:00.360
Eh? On what planet does Charlotte
think it's OK to spoon Gary?

35:00.440 --> 35:02.240
I honestly think it would be fine.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.920
No.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.240
Nah.

35:09.960 --> 35:13.560
We'll have a boys' cheers first.
Yeah. Cheers, boys.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.920
Girls! Girls!
Fanny!

35:17.160 --> 35:20.760
Oh, yous look dead handsome.
Do you wanna go?

35:20.840 --> 35:23.720
We are ready to set sail.
It's time to hit the club.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.720
This club is fuckin' sick.
The music is absolutely pumpin'.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.680
We're gonna have a mint night.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.480
I feel as though I've managed
to get the old Holly back tonight.

35:51.560 --> 35:55.440
She's dancin', twerkin', drinkin'
and smilin', and that is the best.

35:57.560 --> 36:01.840
Holly is back to her old self.
Maybe that means she could move on.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.400
I can't believe it!
I've got me best friend back.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.880
I'm lookin' her dead in the eye
and she is dancin' around

36:15.960 --> 36:19.160
and shakin' them tits,
just like old Holly.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.440
I hope this is the beginnin'
of fun Holly back.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.880
I feel Scott deserves an explanation

36:31.960 --> 36:34.320
for why I've been avoidin' him
the past year.

36:45.200 --> 36:49.760
Kyle didn't like me speakin' to Holly
because I got with her before him.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.880
Holly, I can't promise you that I
won't try to come on to you again.

36:55.960 --> 36:59.000
Cos, howay, man, history has
a tendency to repeat itself.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.760
Oh, my God!

37:03.840 --> 37:06.720
Scott can flirt with me
as much as he wants,

37:06.800 --> 37:09.920
but history will never
be repeatin' itself.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.720
I look over and I don't know
if I'm seein' things,

37:13.800 --> 37:16.880
but Holly and Scott are flirting.
What the fuck?

37:25.920 --> 37:28.880
Scotty and Holly are goin' on
like a blast from the past.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.120
That's all good and well until
you remember Chloe likes him,

37:32.200 --> 37:34.360
and then you're like, shit.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.920
Scott flirting with Holly
is affecting Chloe a lot more,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.120
because they have a history together.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.000
I was havin' a good night until

37:53.080 --> 37:56.680
Holly and Scott became all over each
other. Now I just wanna go home.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.800
Scott was all over fuckin' Holly.
Did anyone notice that?

38:04.880 --> 38:07.760
I can't hold it in any more.
I am fuckin' furious.

38:07.840 --> 38:11.840
Scott is Kyle's close friend.
He was tryin' to cheer her up.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.520
No, he was fuckin'
flirting with her. He was!

38:14.600 --> 38:17.480
As soon as we get in the taxi,
Chloe starts kickin' off.

38:17.560 --> 38:21.280
So Scott and Holly can't talk.
Scott and Marnie can't talk.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.040
Scott and Charlotte can't talk.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.080
(slurs) ...fucking point!

38:25.160 --> 38:27.720
When he flirts with her,
why don't you kick off?

38:27.800 --> 38:31.800
I'll tell you why. Holly shagged
Scott, I haven't. Is that why, Chloe?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.280
Yeah. The truth.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.520
I don't trust her.
She's been with Scott.

38:35.600 --> 38:39.040
Scott doesn't fancy Holly.
He doesn't fancy Chloe, he said!

38:39.120 --> 38:41.960
He doesn't like you, Chlo.
Someone had to tell you.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.360
Tonight, we've had a proper
family night. No-one's pulled,

38:50.440 --> 38:53.600
everyone's had a laugh.
That's what I love about this house.

38:59.760 --> 39:00.800
Shit.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.080
We get back and I've tried me best
to calm down,

39:05.160 --> 39:07.400
but I'm still fuckin' fumin'
with Holly.

39:07.480 --> 39:12.160
(slurs) Fuck you, cunt!
Not helpin' me. You can fuck off!

39:18.720 --> 39:20.400
Flirting with me?

39:21.080 --> 39:22.920
Are you fucking for real?!

39:23.000 --> 39:26.120
Chloe's pissed off over Scott.
Apparently it's my fault.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.760
What the fuck have I done?!

39:30.200 --> 39:32.200
Everyone? Come here!

39:33.560 --> 39:36.760
It's obviously been
a massive family night tonight.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.920
I've never seen Holly so happy.
(Nathan)Same.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
So happy.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.400
Of course Holly was.
She was all over Scott.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.320
I'm so, so, so happy(!)

39:46.400 --> 39:47.720
Really?!

39:47.800 --> 39:51.320
Don't know where she's going with
this, but I won't be rising to it.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.760
Sarcastic little bitch.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.640
I genuinely have had a good night.

39:54.720 --> 39:58.120
So why don't we carry it on.
Shall we all sleep together?

39:58.200 --> 40:00.880
(Scott)Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:00.960 --> 40:02.480
It's been a wicked last night

40:02.560 --> 40:05.440
and now everyone wants to get to bed
for a family spoon.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.320
(Gaz) The order is Charlotte,
me, Holly, Scott...

40:08.400 --> 40:11.400
No, no, no.
Marnie, Aaron, Chloe, Nathan.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.840
Why do I have to sleep next to
Nathan? I wanna sleep next to Scott!

40:14.920 --> 40:18.840
Go downstairs now and we'll all
get in the order down there.

40:18.920 --> 40:23.920
This could be the perfect end to
a family night. I wanna spoon Gary!

40:24.000 --> 40:26.400
Come on! Just find your spot.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.000
(shrieking)

40:31.000 --> 40:33.760
I've had enough of this.
I'm gonna go and find Scott.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.200
I wish she'd leave us.
She's peckin' me head.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.160
You're so ridiculous.
Whatever, Scott.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.920
Shh, shh.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.320
(grunts)

40:53.400 --> 40:57.040
Chloe is being utterly ridiculous.
Me and Scott are friends.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.920
Maybe it's different for her
cos she's never seen us

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
act how we are now.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.080
But she's gonna
have to get used to it.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.200
Chloe has taken her and Scott's
"relationship" far too serious.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.120
She can't be happy for Holly
who's finally smilin'.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.240
(Charlotte) Ah, no!
Fuckin' wanker!

41:14.560 --> 41:15.680
(sobs)

41:16.680 --> 41:18.640
Everyone's havin' a mint time.

41:18.720 --> 41:22.200
I'm by myself and Scott
doesn't even wanna talk to us.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.120
(sobs) I feel so alone.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.480
(sobs heavily)

41:31.640 --> 41:31.840
.
