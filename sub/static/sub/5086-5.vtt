WEBVTT

00:18.133 --> 00:20.267
Did I miss
anything illegal?

00:20.300 --> 00:21.933
A guy driving with
a dog in his lap,

00:21.967 --> 00:24.267
and a woman on her
cell phone while driving--

00:24.300 --> 00:27.567
Ripping asunder
the social fabric.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.933
But nobody
buying a 52-inch LED

00:29.967 --> 00:31.900
out of the back
of a van.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.167
Here's lunch, no
need to thank me.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.167
You're probably
not as much a fan

00:38.200 --> 00:39.833
of gas station cuisine
as my daughter...

00:39.867 --> 00:41.567
I'll gnaw on
tires at this point.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.233
Check this out.

00:46.267 --> 00:47.833
He's parking.

00:47.867 --> 00:50.833
I'm guessing this isn't where he
picks up the kids from soccer.

00:50.867 --> 00:53.800
Could be our salesman.

01:05.667 --> 01:09.200
That's the signal our
source said to look for.

01:13.267 --> 01:17.567
I don't see any
customers lining up.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.167
If his business is slow,
maybe he'll offer you a deal.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.933
I do like a bargain.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.067
Where does this go?

01:37.067 --> 01:38.333
In the cupboard.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.700
Same one you took
it out of last night?

01:40.733 --> 01:43.667
It's hard to remember.
Everything is so new...

01:43.700 --> 01:46.067
I could draw you a map.

01:50.067 --> 01:53.567
Everything about living here
is so different from being

01:53.600 --> 01:55.200
home with Mom and Dad.

01:55.233 --> 01:57.400
We try to be distinctive.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.300
I think it's really
sweet how you help out,

01:59.333 --> 02:02.300
and how you and Aunt Allison
actually talk to each other.

02:02.333 --> 02:06.633
Yeah, conversations
are a lot more quiet.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.100
When's your date night?

02:08.133 --> 02:10.167
Your aunt and I don't
date; we're married.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.467
Our parents are married,
they went out all the time.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.067
Yeah, you don't go out,
just the two of you,

02:15.067 --> 02:18.933
and dance and see
movies and stuff?

02:18.967 --> 02:21.133
You really should.

02:21.167 --> 02:24.167
That's sweet, which makes me
wonder why you want us

02:24.200 --> 02:25.600
out of the house?

02:25.633 --> 02:27.267
Oh, no.
It's not that.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.867
You just should have
time to yourselves.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.933
We had plenty of
time to ourselves.

02:31.967 --> 02:34.233
And then we had children.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.700
Brad?

02:50.733 --> 02:52.800
Hey, I was told to meet
a guy named Brad here.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.700
I was told my buyer
was gonna be a dude.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.333
Do you have problems
dealing with women?

02:57.367 --> 03:01.400
I guess if you've got money,
you're just as good as a man.

03:01.433 --> 03:05.367
I should print
that on a t-shirt.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.900
Quite the selection.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.967
Two hundred dollars lets you
choose whichever one you want.

03:22.267 --> 03:23.633
No.

03:23.667 --> 03:26.267
I only accept small bills,
less traceable.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.433
That was a condition
when I set the meet.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.600
Come on, they're so pretty
when they're this size.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.400
Come on man,
it's all I got.

03:32.433 --> 03:33.667
I'm closing early.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.567
You made a deal.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.667
Come on...

03:37.700 --> 03:40.600
Deal's off!

03:40.633 --> 03:42.067
Police!

03:42.067 --> 03:43.600
Ah, man!

03:43.633 --> 03:47.333
This service sucks,
I'm never shopping here again.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.933
Let's go, you have the right
to remain silent.

04:00.267 --> 04:02.667
This is where the van driver
says he was given the TVs.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.900
And did he tell you
who gave them to him?

04:04.933 --> 04:06.133
He didn't catch
the guy's name,

04:06.167 --> 04:07.733
his memory of the
transaction was lost

04:07.767 --> 04:08.967
in a haze of
marijuana smoke.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.067
So he's worthless
for a physical ID.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.733
Unfortunately, the address
is all that he had to offer.

04:13.767 --> 04:17.367
We followed up with the
landlord; the lease is phony.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.933
He doesen't remember
who's living there,

04:18.967 --> 04:20.400
they've paid cash
since they moved in.

04:20.433 --> 04:21.800
Because none of that
sounds suspicious.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.433
The serial numbers of the
TVs in the van showed up on a

04:24.467 --> 04:26.267
larger list of items that
disappeared from

04:26.300 --> 04:28.433
a shipping center in
Renton last month.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.633
Odds are, TVs
are inside that house.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.467
Too bad we don't have
enough for a warrant

04:31.500 --> 04:32.567
to get inside and look.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.367
Maybe we could
volunteer to wash the windows.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.467
A little
community service.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.800
Check around
the neighborhood,

04:37.833 --> 04:39.200
see what anyone's
seen or heard.

04:39.233 --> 04:40.367
On it.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.633
But be discreet.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.633
We don't want to panic the
neighbors with the thought of

04:43.667 --> 04:44.933
a crime ring in
the neighborhood.

04:44.967 --> 04:46.967
Even though there's a crime
ring in the neighborhood?

04:47.067 --> 04:49.433
Proof before process.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.400
And as part of the program,
we're going door-to-door

04:54.433 --> 04:56.100
to encourage people
in the neighborhood

04:56.133 --> 04:57.433
to look out for each other.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.633
Ma'am, do you know
your neighbors well?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.267
Rita and I don't
speak anymore.

05:01.300 --> 05:05.233
I don't care to
explain why.

05:05.267 --> 05:06.733
And across the street?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.733
Oh, I absolutely
love that young man.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.067
Young man?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.233
Yes, keeps to himself.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.167
Never even met him,
which is just fine by me.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.267
Do you know his name?

05:14.300 --> 05:16.733
No, I couldn't even tell you
if that's him right there.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.700
Hey, stop!

05:20.733 --> 05:23.133
Thanks very much ma'am.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.600
Get off!

06:28.433 --> 06:30.067
You can't do this!

06:30.067 --> 06:31.967
All you had to do
was not run away.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.067
But thank you very much
because now that you ran,

06:34.100 --> 06:36.767
we get to look at what
you didn't want us to see.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.633
Doesn't anybody keep cars
in their garages anymore?

06:43.667 --> 06:45.467
What a shame.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
By the time you
get out of prison,

06:47.433 --> 06:49.667
these'll probably
be obsolete.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.333
Let's go.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.233
Okay Paul,
let's keep it short.

07:10.267 --> 07:12.167
I don't like being
anybody's hands-free.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.300
Can't you just
uncuff me?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.633
Guys who try kick out the
windows of my car stay cuffed.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.133
It's a little
rule we have.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.100
It went right
to voicemail.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.867
You know what they
say: wait for the beep.

07:24.767 --> 07:28.333
Hey Billy,
it's me.

07:32.067 --> 07:35.133
I'm in trouble and
I need you to come get me.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.567
They're gonna
put me away again,

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
you know
what's gonna happen.

07:37.633 --> 07:43.800
I just...
please come get me.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.600
How did
this happen?

07:45.633 --> 07:50.067
I can't do this,
I can't...

07:53.933 --> 07:55.633
No, wait!
Billy, don't go!

07:55.667 --> 07:57.500
Hey! Hey!

08:02.667 --> 08:05.067
Somebody get him to holding
before he breaks something!

08:06.667 --> 08:09.300
Relax! Settle down!
Hey!

08:09.333 --> 08:11.267
No, not there. Please!

08:11.300 --> 08:17.900
Billy!
Please!

08:17.933 --> 08:19.833
I don't know that Paul will
be a productive source

08:19.867 --> 08:21.067
of information right now.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.133
Maybe he'll be more cooperative
after a good night's sleep.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.300
Not that he's
getting one tonight.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.267
So, I was thinking
about the calendar.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.467
Oh right.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.567
One of us has to go to that
zoning thing for the school.

08:41.600 --> 08:47.433
I was thinking about
tomorrow night.

08:47.467 --> 08:51.567
I was thinking
about a date.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.933
You and me?

08:52.967 --> 08:55.700
That would be
my first choice.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.200
Sure.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.167
Look at you
asking me on a date,

09:01.200 --> 09:02.500
like we're not
even married.

09:02.533 --> 09:05.233
We're sleeping together, so
I figured it was appropriate.

09:05.267 --> 09:09.333
It's a great idea.
Who gave it to you?

09:09.367 --> 09:14.067
Nobody. I'm capable of a
romantic gesture by myself.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.367
Uh-huh.

09:18.367 --> 09:22.067
Is that story going to hold
up if I start asking around?

09:22.067 --> 09:24.433
All right, it was
Cam and Mariah.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.667
Really?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.600
Why do those two want
us out of the house?

09:28.633 --> 09:30.067
That was my question.

09:30.067 --> 09:33.767
But apparently Jackie and
Tim always had date night.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.933
Oh, because their marriage
is so much better than ours?

09:35.967 --> 09:39.067
Baby, it's not
a competition.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.300
You're right.
It's absolutely no contest.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.100
This is going to
be so much fun.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.933
We get to go on a date!

09:45.967 --> 09:47.200
Yeah.

09:47.233 --> 09:51.233
If we can remember
how to have one.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.867
I heard it was a
rough night in holding.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.967
You calling for your brother
and keeping everyone awake.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.100
I need to talk to Billy.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.333
Why don't you talk to us
while you're waiting for him?

10:11.367 --> 10:13.067
No, him first.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.933
He'll come as soon as
he gets my message.

10:14.967 --> 10:18.367
That was last night, Paul.
What if he doesn't come?

10:18.400 --> 10:21.333
You don't understand.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.567
He's going to lose
it when he finds out.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.200
Finds out what
you've been up to?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.500
Or finds out
that we busted you?

10:27.533 --> 10:33.767
I didn't do anything.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.733
Which is why you ran away
from a house with

10:35.767 --> 10:38.267
$40,000 in
stolen electronics.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.833
A guy like you, who's
already done time

10:40.867 --> 10:43.700
for burglary and
transporting?

10:43.733 --> 10:46.433
That's going to mean
prison for a long time.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.900
Fortunately, you
already know people there.

10:48.933 --> 10:54.833
No, if I go
back to that place...

10:57.100 --> 11:02.100
No, Billy
will make it right...

11:07.567 --> 11:08.700
Paul is the
distribution level,

11:08.733 --> 11:10.167
but there are
levels above him.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.633
We can't tell if it's loyalty
or fear, but he won't spill.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.533
He won't give us anything
about who he answers to.

11:14.567 --> 11:15.633
Has he lawyered up?

11:15.667 --> 11:17.167
No he'll only
talk to his brother.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.700
Isn't that sweet.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.233
I've got him on
possession and flight,

11:20.267 --> 11:21.767
but he won't confess
to selling, even though

11:21.800 --> 11:24.067
we've got a witness who'll
testify he was doing just that.

11:24.067 --> 11:25.833
And that would be
your doped-up van driver,

11:25.867 --> 11:26.967
Mr. Credibility?

11:27.067 --> 11:29.667
And our guy was sitting on a
garage packed to the rafters

11:29.700 --> 11:30.733
in stolen televisions.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.800
And you know, that does
not get you intent to sell.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.133
Especially if we're going
to reach up and put away our

11:35.167 --> 11:38.200
bigger fish, we're going
to need a lot more than that.

11:38.233 --> 11:41.767
Come back when you have
a lot more than that.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.467
Here's my card ma'am,

11:52.500 --> 11:55.900
if you think of anything just
let us know. Thank you.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.533
I'm continually amazed
that no one knows

11:58.567 --> 12:00.100
their neighbors
these days.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.533
That would require
looking away from a screen,

12:01.567 --> 12:03.867
and actually looking
out the window.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.800
You know, I've got a
confidential informant

12:05.833 --> 12:07.600
who works at a diner near
the shipping station

12:07.633 --> 12:09.067
that the TVs
were taken from.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.100
We can stop in tonight, see
if he's heard anything.

12:11.133 --> 12:14.367
What time were you thinking?
I have a date.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.233
With whom?

12:15.267 --> 12:19.067
Matt. My husband's taking
me on a date.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.867
Is he going to let you
wear his letterman jacket?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.467
I don't know,
maybe his tool belt.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.433
Go.
Have fun.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.433
I'll hit up the fleetwood
diner, and maybe take

12:29.467 --> 12:31.767
a special eight-year-old
on a date, too.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.367
Is Arielle still having her
mac and cheese obsession?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.467
She's developing
a very refined palate.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.467
We've progressed all the
way to pizza and ice cream.

12:56.800 --> 13:02.500
Wow, Uncle Matt,
you look fantastic.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.267
Yeah, I clean
up all right.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.467
When's the last time you
took Mom out on a date, anyway?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.800
I don't know, when
were you born again?

13:08.833 --> 13:10.333
Try not to get
my socks dirty;

13:10.367 --> 13:12.100
I'm going to need
them back after.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.567
They'll be washed
and ironed.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.733
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.100
Wow.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.433
You look gorgeous.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.567
Thank you.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.633
Some of this is an
illusion, but it should

13:24.667 --> 13:27.433
hold together
for a bit.

13:27.467 --> 13:28.667
Alright, listen up.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.233
I know this is the first time
we've left you alone here in

13:31.267 --> 13:33.067
the evening since
Mariah and Cameron moved in,

13:33.100 --> 13:35.067
but that's not because
we don't trust you --

13:35.100 --> 13:36.800
You don't trust us.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.333
He didn't say that.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.467
Don't worry.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.767
I can get through the
night without being arrested.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.300
Especially since there won't
be a cop on the premises.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.833
That's actually
pretty good logic.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.833
I know how to call 9-1-1
in case my little brother

13:48.867 --> 13:50.833
burns down the
house or something.

13:50.867 --> 13:54.533
Except, wait, what's the
number for 9-1-1 again?

13:54.567 --> 13:57.233
Alright, everybody get
your homework done, okay?

13:57.267 --> 14:02.400
Yeah and no visitors,
it's a school night.

14:02.433 --> 14:03.967
What time are you
going to be home?

14:04.067 --> 14:05.067
I don't know.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.133
We might stay out all
night, like we used to.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.367
Remember those days?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.300
I do.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.133
Where are my keys?

14:11.167 --> 14:14.633
They're on
your desk.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.600
Bye!

14:15.633 --> 14:18.433
Bye, have fun!

14:28.067 --> 14:30.100
What's the address
of this place again?

14:30.133 --> 14:31.567
Why?

14:31.600 --> 14:34.867
Just so I don't
mix up the numbers.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.433
Never mind, I got it.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.367
Big electronics warehouse
near here that got hit.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.667
Know anything about that?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.667
All that high tech wizardry,
and they can't find

14:59.700 --> 15:03.400
a better way to lock those
metal doors? It's a shame.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.267
We arrested a
guy, Paul Brandt,

15:05.300 --> 15:06.433
who came into possession

15:06.467 --> 15:07.833
of a large piece of
what's missing.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.667
Brandt?
I hear that name a lot.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.100
He was in here
not too long ago,

15:11.133 --> 15:14.067
bragging about selling hot TVs
to people who should be able

15:14.067 --> 15:15.467
to afford new ones.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.967
Would you recognize him?

15:17.067 --> 15:19.067
No, I don't think so.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.433
My view from the grill
is a little obscured.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.067
I'd recognize
his bike, though.

15:23.067 --> 15:24.133
His bike?

15:24.167 --> 15:26.300
Yeah, he had this brand new
motorcycle parked out front.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.500
With ape hangers, I've
never understood those things,

15:29.533 --> 15:32.067
because they make
you look like an ape.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.967
Let me know if you
remember anything else.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.233
Hey, let me make
you a grilled cheese.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.300
Best in the state.

15:37.333 --> 15:41.167
Thanks, but I'm saving
room for pizza and ice cream.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.900
I've never heard two people
yell at each other that loud.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.533
If you ever want to
test our marriage,

15:58.567 --> 16:00.433
we should hire someone
to remodel our kitchen.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.900
I love our kitchen!
But I know what you mean.

16:02.933 --> 16:07.133
One time Devin and I caught a
call where this woman was --

16:07.167 --> 16:08.633
What are we doing?
We're on a date.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.133
We shouldn't be
talking about work.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.667
You're right.
Done.

16:15.467 --> 16:18.467
So, how long do we let our
niece and nephew play the

16:18.500 --> 16:20.367
I'm new to this
house card?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.767
Huh?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.600
We're putting away
the dishes, and --

16:26.333 --> 16:28.900
What?

16:28.933 --> 16:33.067
I'm on a date with the
most beautiful woman

16:33.100 --> 16:38.233
in this restaurant.
No kids, no work.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.900
Just you and me.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.200
That sounds like
the perfect date.

16:53.967 --> 16:56.200
Nice band.

16:56.233 --> 16:57.533
Yeah.

16:57.567 --> 17:02.733
We can brave the dance
floor after we order.

17:02.767 --> 17:05.200
You look great.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.600
Thanks.

17:07.633 --> 17:14.600
I had to borrow the
socks, from our son.

17:26.633 --> 17:27.900
Is Cameron here?

17:27.933 --> 17:28.833
Yeah, but--

17:28.867 --> 17:31.533
Hey, you made it!
It's good to see you man!

17:53.300 --> 17:55.300
Excuse me.

17:55.333 --> 17:58.667
Whoa, Rachel,
what are you doing?

17:58.700 --> 18:00.333
Did you tell these guys
they could come over?

18:00.367 --> 18:01.833
I guess I did.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.233
We're not supposed
to have anyone over

18:03.267 --> 18:05.233
on school nights, Cameron.
Weren't you listening?

18:05.267 --> 18:07.667
Hey, as long as your
parents never know,

18:07.700 --> 18:09.400
everything will work
out just fine.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.200
I texted some
friends, too.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
They can't do this.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.233
I know. Don't freak out
I'll take care of things.

18:25.267 --> 18:27.500
Just calm down.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.900
So, listen. Not that it
isn't a pleasure

18:29.933 --> 18:31.700
to meet some of
Cameron's friends --

18:31.733 --> 18:33.933
Oh, you're just
surprised he's got any.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.900
Did Cameron mention my mom
is a police detective

18:37.933 --> 18:40.500
and my dad has lots of very
sharp power tools?

18:40.533 --> 18:43.267
No, he didn't
mention any of that.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.267
All said was he's
got the prettiest,

18:46.300 --> 18:49.500
sweetest cousin
who I just had to meet.

18:51.667 --> 18:55.067
Thanks, but you
have to go.

18:56.967 --> 19:00.767
You're kicking me out
before you even know me?

19:00.800 --> 19:06.300
Some people think
I'm kind of adorable.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.333
How come you didn't dance like
that when we were younger?

19:38.367 --> 19:42.900
I just didn't know how
good a partner you could be.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.633
Want to skip the movie?

19:49.667 --> 19:52.267
We could stay here,
order some dessert,

19:52.300 --> 19:54.067
and see where
the night takes us.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.200
I have to be home
before I go to --

19:56.233 --> 19:59.367
the place we're not
talking about.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.667
I'll get the
dessert menus.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.467
Should I call the kids and
tell them we're gonna be late?

20:03.500 --> 20:06.800
That's the other thing
we're not talking about.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.700
Should we show
'em how it's done?

20:31.733 --> 20:34.000
Yes!

20:39.700 --> 20:43.067
I'm Billy Brandt. My brother,
Paul, is being held here?

20:43.100 --> 20:47.100
I need to see him, please.
Even just for a minute.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.367
Come on.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.067
I didn't listen to
his message until now.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.500
If I'd known he was in this
much trouble, and needed me...

21:00.533 --> 21:01.567
I would've gotten
here earlier!

21:01.600 --> 21:04.367
Okay! Wait here.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.167
Brandt, your brother's here!

21:11.200 --> 21:15.633
Assistance! Attempted
suicide, cell block three!

21:15.667 --> 21:17.100
Assistance!

21:17.133 --> 21:25.833
Paul! Open the door! Paul, I'm
here! Paul! Let me in! Paul!

21:31.067 --> 21:35.300
Paging Dr. Porter,
paging Dr. Porter.

21:35.333 --> 21:37.533
She's coming!

21:37.567 --> 21:39.467
Detective McLean!

21:39.500 --> 21:40.833
Hi Arielle.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.200
Do you remember
my husband?

21:42.233 --> 21:43.800
I think so.
Hello!

21:43.833 --> 21:45.667
Hello!
Hey Devin.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.833
Hey Matt. Sorry to
interrupt your evening.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.333
Hey, we interrupted
yours, too.

21:50.367 --> 21:53.067
My ex is out of town, and I
thought it quicker and simpler

21:53.067 --> 21:55.200
to let Arielle and come
help Daddy with his work.

21:55.233 --> 21:57.833
Well, Arielle and I can
keep each other company

21:57.867 --> 21:59.200
if she doesn't mind.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.400
Can you stay with Mr. McLean
while Detective McLean and I

22:01.433 --> 22:02.500
go talk to somebody?

22:02.533 --> 22:04.067
I guess it's okay.

22:04.067 --> 22:05.067
Alright!

22:05.100 --> 22:06.700
Thanks.

22:06.733 --> 22:07.533
Just this way.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.733
We shouldn't
be too long.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.733
No problem.

22:10.767 --> 22:13.433
I can't believe how much
bigger you've gotten since

22:13.467 --> 22:17.567
the last time I saw you.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.333
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

22:20.367 --> 22:21.567
I'm not hungry.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.833
Detective McLean and
I ate on our date.

22:23.867 --> 22:27.367
Your date?
Is she your girlfriend?

22:27.400 --> 22:32.167
Yeah, that too.
What would you like to eat?

22:32.200 --> 22:34.100
Pizza and ice cream!

22:34.133 --> 22:36.067
Pizza and ice cream?

22:36.067 --> 22:38.900
That's, umm... yeah,
let's see what we can do.

22:38.933 --> 22:40.067
Come on.

22:52.533 --> 22:54.600
What are you doing?

22:54.633 --> 22:58.567
One of the girls who came
with Chris is a little sick.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.333
How little?

23:00.367 --> 23:01.900
Throwing up in
the bathroom.

23:01.933 --> 23:05.333
It's okay; I'll
take care of it.

23:07.833 --> 23:10.567
I don't know what's going on,
we need to get rid of them

23:10.600 --> 23:12.300
before Mom and Dad
come home.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.667
I know, okay?
You freaking out doesn't help.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.233
Excuse me?

23:22.267 --> 23:23.367
I need a couple of glasses.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.200
Why?

23:24.233 --> 23:25.833
What's going on?
Hey, back off.

23:25.867 --> 23:27.067
And if I say no?

23:27.067 --> 23:29.567
Get away from her, now.

23:35.167 --> 23:39.633
Okay, little man.
Well played.

23:39.667 --> 23:43.133
Are you guys drinking?

23:43.167 --> 23:45.900
All night long.

23:45.933 --> 23:48.967
Why do you think
I need glasses?

23:49.067 --> 23:50.233
Do you want some?

23:50.267 --> 23:52.867
No.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.067
That's too bad.

24:00.167 --> 24:03.900
I meant no,
nobody's doing that.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.833
Mr. Brandt nearly
ruptured his esophagus,

24:12.867 --> 24:15.167
but his airflow is just
about back to normal.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.300
Can we talk to him?

24:16.333 --> 24:17.533
Not any time soon.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.367
He'll be unconscious until
at least the morning.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.600
We'll need to keep a uniform
at his door in case --

24:21.633 --> 24:24.600
Hey! Are you the idiot cops
that put Paul Brandt in jail?

24:24.633 --> 24:26.067
My brother's nearly
dead because of you!

24:26.067 --> 24:27.067
You need to calm down...

24:27.067 --> 24:28.067
Why wasn't
anyone watching him?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.967
You should've known he'd
try something like this.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.133
We understand you're upset.

24:31.167 --> 24:33.667
But your brother didn't
present as a suicide risk.

24:33.700 --> 24:34.767
Of course he was at risk!

24:34.800 --> 24:37.067
They almost killed him
last time he was in prison.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.367
Stabbed him just
for being stupid.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.567
What'd you think was going
to happen if he goes back?

24:40.600 --> 24:41.733
I hold you
responsible --

24:41.767 --> 24:44.900
Careful.
Just have a seat.

25:01.500 --> 25:08.100
It's not right.
Just not right.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.133
He shouldn't
have been alone.

25:17.067 --> 25:20.333
Helping my
brother was my job.

25:20.367 --> 25:23.333
Has been for years.

25:23.367 --> 25:26.233
Let me see your hands!
Out of the car slowly!

25:26.267 --> 25:30.500
Ahh, sweet hell!

25:30.533 --> 25:32.967
It's him?

25:33.067 --> 25:35.367
I couldn't
get him to stop.

25:35.400 --> 25:40.400
Bad choice after bad choice,
I tried to steer him back.

25:40.433 --> 25:41.800
Get him back on his feet,

25:41.833 --> 25:43.400
start him on a
better path, y'know?

25:43.433 --> 25:45.133
I do.

25:45.167 --> 25:48.400
But every time, he just
got deeper and deeper.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.200
Pulled me down with him,
until I had to--

25:50.233 --> 25:52.233
Take a stand?

25:52.267 --> 25:55.067
Uhh, Alison,
you gotta believe me!

25:55.067 --> 25:56.200
Put your hands on your head.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.300
This was not my plan.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.567
Put your hands on your head!

25:58.600 --> 26:00.067
Allison, I can explain--

26:00.100 --> 26:02.867
Put your hands
on your head now!

26:02.900 --> 26:05.267
You don't wanna hear
what I have to say?

26:05.300 --> 26:07.433
I've heard it.
It's not your fault,

26:07.467 --> 26:10.133
these aren't your friends,
that's not your money.

26:10.167 --> 26:14.533
Sure, let's go with that.

26:14.567 --> 26:19.267
Timothy Alexander Olson, you
have the right to remain silent.

26:19.300 --> 26:24.967
Anything you sau can
and will be used against y--

26:25.067 --> 26:27.400
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

26:27.433 --> 26:30.167
in a court of law.

26:30.467 --> 26:31.967
You have the right
to an attorney,

26:32.067 --> 26:38.267
If you cannot afford one,
one will be chosen for you.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.500
I know it's hard, but sometimes
it's the only thing

26:40.533 --> 26:43.300
that can save them.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.600
What happened to my
brother is my fault.

26:55.633 --> 26:58.500
It's up to me
to make it right.

27:13.233 --> 27:15.567
Is this why there's a girl
puking in our guest bathroom?

27:15.600 --> 27:19.767
She's not puking anymore,
she's resting.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.833
I don't know what anybody's
trying to prove here,

27:21.867 --> 27:24.333
but we're done. Cameron,
your friends need to leave.

27:24.367 --> 27:26.267
Ignore my cousin.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.167
These are the ones that grew
up on the side of the family

27:29.200 --> 27:31.867
that don't know
how to have fun.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.567
Yeah, look at her.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.767
She doesn't even
know how to smile.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.900
I'm not even sure
we're related.

27:38.933 --> 27:39.967
That's it, I'm calling Mom.

27:40.067 --> 27:42.067
No!

27:48.067 --> 27:52.300
My cousins don't know me
as well as they think they do.

27:52.333 --> 27:56.167
I'm all for having a good time.
But not here and now, okay?

27:56.200 --> 27:59.100
So why don't you take your
bottle and your friends and go,

27:59.133 --> 28:01.267
before my parents come home?

28:05.667 --> 28:10.233
I like the way your lip
quivered when you said that.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.200
Actually, I have no
problem with leaving.

28:15.233 --> 28:21.367
Soon as the hottest girl in
this room finishes this glass.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.067
If that's what it takes...

28:23.067 --> 28:31.833
Not you, I meant her.

28:31.867 --> 28:35.733
You drink, we leave.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.267
You want me
to drink this?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.133
Bad luck to leave
before the bottle's empty.

28:47.167 --> 28:48.400
Rachel, don't even think --

28:48.433 --> 28:49.733
And then you'll leave?

28:49.767 --> 28:54.100
That's what I said.

28:58.433 --> 29:01.900
Fine.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.200
Whoa! Rachel!

29:06.233 --> 29:11.767
Maybe we are related.

29:11.800 --> 29:15.567
Guess I don't know you as
well as I thought I did.

29:19.533 --> 29:26.067
Okay Chris, I did my thing,
now you do yours.

29:26.067 --> 29:30.067
The bar is closed.
Everyone out.

29:47.067 --> 29:50.367
All right.
A deal's a deal.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.900
You heard her!
Let's go guys.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.533
Good seeing you, dude.

29:56.567 --> 29:58.133
Yeah, nice seeing you.

29:58.167 --> 30:03.200
We'll chill again soon okay?
And bring your cousin.

30:03.233 --> 30:05.900
She's fun.

30:22.367 --> 30:25.767
Dr. Kravitz, you have a
visitor in the main lobby.

30:25.800 --> 30:31.200
Dr. Kravitz, a visitor
in the main lobby.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.267
Looks like they hit it off,
I hate to disturb them.

30:35.300 --> 30:40.233
I can carry mine to the car,
good luck with yours.

30:57.933 --> 31:02.267
Our evening didn't turn
out exactly like we'd hoped.

31:02.300 --> 31:07.067
I've had worse dates that
ended up at worse hospitals.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.467
Let's just try
again soon, okay?

31:09.500 --> 31:13.967
This date can end the way
dates are supposed to end.

31:17.967 --> 31:21.833
We have a bedroom in that house
over there, we can use it.

31:21.867 --> 31:24.600
I bet you say that
to all your husbands.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.400
Hi! How was your date?

31:58.433 --> 32:01.600
It was really nice.

32:05.733 --> 32:08.067
Is there a reason someone
decided to clean

32:08.067 --> 32:11.067
while we were gone?

32:11.100 --> 32:14.067
Oh, um, we just wanted
to show you that,

32:14.100 --> 32:16.900
if you left us alone, the
house would look better when

32:16.933 --> 32:20.767
you came back
than when you left.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.133
I want to believe that,
but I don't.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.367
My friend
Chris came by.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.067
Chris? The one with the
attitude from the other day?

32:31.067 --> 32:33.833
Yeah. My best friend
from my old school.

32:33.867 --> 32:36.133
He thought he could
stop by and surprise me.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.333
It was absolutely
no big deal.

32:38.367 --> 32:40.700
Except for the fact
that we said no visitors.

32:40.733 --> 32:42.367
They didn't stay long.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.600
They?

32:45.633 --> 32:47.133
He had some
friends with him.

32:47.167 --> 32:50.100
It was fine. We told them
about the school night rule,

32:50.133 --> 32:52.067
and they left.

32:52.067 --> 32:54.933
Chris is a good guy.
He got it.

32:54.967 --> 32:57.233
I appreciate your honesty.

33:00.633 --> 33:04.267
So, you drinking
coffee, Rachel?

33:04.300 --> 33:08.533
Um, yeah, I... I have a
calc quiz tomorrow,

33:08.567 --> 33:12.533
and I need another hour or
two to nail the information.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.600
How's everybody
else doing?

33:16.633 --> 33:18.367
I'm actually done
with my homework,

33:18.400 --> 33:21.067
so I'm going to bed.
Good night!

33:21.067 --> 33:24.067
Glad you had fun.

33:24.067 --> 33:27.833
Good night.

33:29.533 --> 33:33.133
Okay, good night.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.400
Why do I get the feeling we're
not being told the truth?

33:37.433 --> 33:41.433
I believe some kid
named Chris came by.

33:41.467 --> 33:45.800
But yeah, they are
definitely hiding something.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.267
Behind a united front.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.800
God help us.
Where are you going?

33:50.833 --> 33:53.533
If they were up to what
I think they were up to,

33:53.567 --> 33:55.067
they've covered their tracks.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.367
Here's how it
works at the station.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.233
I ask someone tell me
their version of events.

34:29.267 --> 34:32.233
Say my friend Chris came by,
but nothing happened, and then

34:32.267 --> 34:35.267
I try to match what they've
said with the evidence I find.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.267
Like a house that's been
cleaned for no reason,

34:37.300 --> 34:39.600
Rachel drinking
coffee at bed time,

34:39.633 --> 34:42.433
and an empty bottle of whiskey
I found in our trash bag,

34:42.467 --> 34:48.067
but thrown in the Williams' bin.
Anybody have anything to offer?

34:49.667 --> 34:52.367
Okay, I'm going to tell you
how it works in this house.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.733
People make bad choices,
we understand that.

34:54.767 --> 34:57.867
But we tell the truth
about those choices,

34:57.900 --> 35:00.633
because we tell the
truth about everything.

35:00.667 --> 35:03.367
We're not going to pretend
you're not hiding something,

35:03.400 --> 35:05.100
and you're not going
to pretend we're stupid.

35:05.133 --> 35:05.867
So, what happened?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.133
I didn't do anything.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.633
Yeah, but they
were your friends.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.700
Who came by when they
weren't supposed to.

35:11.733 --> 35:13.100
Whose bottle was it?

35:13.133 --> 35:16.633
Mom, Dad, we always respect
the rules of this house.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.333
Normally, that would
be music to my ears.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.733
But when you use it to
grandstand, we're done here.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.100
Without an explanation?

35:22.133 --> 35:24.400
If they want to lie together,
they can be grounded together.

35:24.433 --> 35:25.233
What?!

35:25.267 --> 35:26.500
How is that fair?

35:26.533 --> 35:28.067
Truth and fairness
go hand in hand.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.933
Don't get one if you
don't give the other.

35:29.967 --> 35:31.267
A fact that you
can contemplate,

35:31.300 --> 35:32.433
while cleaning the
attic this Saturday.

35:32.467 --> 35:34.600
Cancel your plans for
the next several Saturdays,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.600
because there's plenty
to do after the attic.

35:36.633 --> 35:39.367
This must be the warm,
loving environment,

35:39.400 --> 35:41.533
everyone told me I
was missing out on.

35:41.567 --> 35:45.100
Everybody to bed.

35:53.533 --> 35:56.200
Do you have
something to say, Rachel?

36:01.700 --> 36:04.200
Good night.

36:14.633 --> 36:18.333
Morning. Lieutenant said
we have a complication?

36:18.367 --> 36:20.133
Yeah, Billy Brandt
came in this morning

36:20.167 --> 36:21.833
and demanded we place
him under arrest.

36:21.867 --> 36:23.133
For what?

36:23.167 --> 36:25.867
For his little
brother's crime.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.400
Okay, I admit it.

36:32.433 --> 36:37.100
I thought I could fly under
the radar and I couldn't.

36:37.133 --> 36:39.500
So you're claiming that you've
been moving hot electronics

36:39.533 --> 36:41.500
out of that address
for six months?

36:41.533 --> 36:45.300
Yes, that's my base and I
hire people I can trust

36:45.333 --> 36:47.433
to handle deliveries.

36:47.467 --> 36:49.133
Obviously, that part
of the plan needs work.

36:49.167 --> 36:50.433
And Paul's part in this?

36:50.467 --> 36:54.133
Didn't have one. I love my
little brother, but he's not

36:54.167 --> 36:56.600
gonna make the
cover of Forbes.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.667
Why was he at that address?

36:58.700 --> 37:01.867
Is it against the law to hang
out at your brother's house?

37:01.900 --> 37:05.500
And he ran from
us for exercise?

37:05.533 --> 37:07.400
Have you seen Paul's
history with the police?

37:07.433 --> 37:09.233
He'd run from a
crossing guard.

37:09.267 --> 37:11.533
Doesn't mean he's guilty of
possession with intent to sell.

37:11.567 --> 37:12.400
But you are?

37:12.433 --> 37:13.933
Yes, ma'am.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.267
And when we talk to drivers
and other individuals who ID

37:16.300 --> 37:18.133
your brother as the guy they've
been doing business with?

37:18.167 --> 37:20.133
They're just going to be
ID-ing a guy who looks like

37:20.167 --> 37:22.467
me, who has the
same haircut as me,

37:22.500 --> 37:24.600
who's sometimes
mistaken for me.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.067
Almost as if we came
from the same parents.

37:27.067 --> 37:29.100
You don't get to
just say, I did it.

37:29.133 --> 37:31.467
There has to be some actual
evidence that you did it.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.700
You mean like bank receipts
showing how I withdrew cash

37:34.733 --> 37:37.100
every month to pay
the rent on my house?

37:37.133 --> 37:39.267
Or how my prints are
all over that place?

37:39.300 --> 37:40.267
Because you
visited your brother!

37:40.300 --> 37:43.300
Or he visited me.

37:43.733 --> 37:46.067
Look I know what
you're trying to do.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.700
You're trying to
protect your brother.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.967
But this isn't
the way to do it.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.367
You arrested the
wrong guy, detectives,

37:52.400 --> 37:53.900
and you need
to let him go.

37:53.933 --> 37:56.400
I'm not gonna let my little
brother get punished because

37:56.433 --> 37:58.733
neither of you can get
your facts straight.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.200
We've got our facts straight.

38:00.233 --> 38:01.933
They just don't match
your facts.

38:01.967 --> 38:03.700
Let me sort it
out one more time.

38:03.733 --> 38:06.800
I paid the rent,
I fit the description,

38:06.833 --> 38:08.900
I'm the one
saying I did it.

38:08.933 --> 38:12.167
That gives you evidence,
a witness and a confession.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.833
I can't figure out why you
haven't already arrested me.

38:15.867 --> 38:19.467
What kind of
detectives are you?

38:26.267 --> 38:29.067
The ADA thinks the case
against Billy will hold.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.100
Even though
he didn't do it?

38:30.133 --> 38:32.400
There's enough to convince
a judge that he did.

38:32.433 --> 38:33.900
He's covering for
his little brother.

38:33.933 --> 38:35.700
You can prove
that in a court of law?

38:35.733 --> 38:38.067
If Billy's story holds up
and he's willing to swear

38:38.067 --> 38:40.333
to a confession, it just
might be the truth.

38:40.367 --> 38:41.767
You need to let the
younger brother go.

38:41.800 --> 38:42.633
Lieutenant--

38:42.667 --> 38:44.533
We will keep an eye on
Paul and next time

38:44.567 --> 38:46.233
he does something stupid,
we'll get him for that.

38:46.267 --> 38:48.700
Yes, ma'am.

38:48.733 --> 38:52.067
Anyone flashy enough to get a
motorcycle with ape hangers

38:52.067 --> 38:54.433
is bound to slip up again.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.900
How's my
little brother?

38:56.933 --> 38:59.200
Paul's going to be discharged
from the hospital tonight.

38:59.233 --> 39:00.367
And then he'll be released?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.267
All the charges
will be dropped.

39:04.833 --> 39:07.500
It's a shame you're not going to
be able to enjoy that motorcycle

39:07.533 --> 39:10.533
you bought with all the profits
from your illegal activity.

39:12.533 --> 39:15.333
Yeah. I'm going to miss that
feeling of the open road.

39:15.367 --> 39:17.733
Except you didn't buy a
motorcycle, your brother did.

39:17.767 --> 39:20.467
I talked to the owner of the
shop. Your brother paid cash,

39:20.500 --> 39:22.900
and signed Paul
Brandt on the title.

39:22.933 --> 39:25.867
I hope he enjoys the ride.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.467
I'm the one who deserves
the time, detective.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.800
I'm willing to do it.

39:45.533 --> 39:48.267
When was the last time
this place was even cleaned?

39:48.300 --> 39:50.833
Probably the last time
these two got in trouble.

39:50.867 --> 39:55.767
So, never. I don't know why I
should have to do anything.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.233
I wasn't the one downing
shots like my crazy cousin.

39:59.267 --> 40:02.633
I was making the best of a bad
situation because your brother

40:02.667 --> 40:04.467
brought his
druggie friends over.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.000
I'd have invited your
friends, if you had any.

40:07.033 --> 40:10.033
Guys, stop.
This is everyone's fault.

40:10.067 --> 40:12.000
We were all there, that's
why we're all here.

40:12.033 --> 40:14.800
Yeah, in this house
I never asked to live in.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.733
But this is where you are
living, with our mom and dad.

40:17.767 --> 40:20.067
Is it so hard to
just do what they say?

40:20.100 --> 40:23.733
Guys look busy,
the inspection crew is here.

40:27.533 --> 40:31.200
Wow... nice work.

40:31.233 --> 40:33.533
It's amazing what a motivator
collective guilt can be.

40:33.567 --> 40:35.967
It should look good, we've been
working for three hours.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.167
Just three hours?
That's great.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.200
Means you still have time
to wash the cars.

40:39.233 --> 40:41.000
Now? But I was gonna --

40:41.033 --> 40:42.100
Gonna wash the cars?

40:42.133 --> 40:44.733
That means what you were
planning to do and what you're

40:44.767 --> 40:48.500
going to do are the
same thing... imagine that.

40:54.367 --> 40:56.200
Just a minute Rachel.
I want to talk to you.

40:56.233 --> 40:57.333
I should help them --

40:57.367 --> 40:59.267
Rachel.

41:01.233 --> 41:03.633
It's an important part of my
job to be able to walk into

41:03.667 --> 41:06.067
a room and know what
happened before I got there.

41:06.067 --> 41:08.500
I know that's part
of being a detective.

41:08.533 --> 41:11.533
I'm talking about
being a mom.

41:13.733 --> 41:17.667
We raised you to be smart
and use good judgment.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.467
So when you hide something
from us, I can only imagine

41:20.500 --> 41:23.333
it's because you're ashamed
of the choice you made.

41:23.367 --> 41:26.933
That you knew
it was wrong.

41:26.967 --> 41:30.533
More importantly, we raised
you to tell the truth.

41:32.233 --> 41:35.133
So why did
you lie to us?

41:40.233 --> 41:42.633
I...

41:48.800 --> 41:51.200
I love you.

41:51.233 --> 41:55.833
I'm sorry mom,
that's the truth.

41:55.867 --> 42:00.233
I know.

42:04.133 --> 42:06.367
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

42:06.400 --> 42:09.767
Not right now.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.433
Okay.

42:12.467 --> 42:16.133
I suppose that wasn't
enough to get me out

42:16.167 --> 42:18.067
of washing the cars?

42:18.100 --> 42:22.767
No, but it was
still worth a lot.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.367
Nice try.
