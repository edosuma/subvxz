02:08.245 --> 02:09.713
You're neat. Bye.

02:09.746 --> 02:11.215
Bye, Hudson.

02:11.248 --> 02:12.449
I like him.

02:12.482 --> 02:14.784
He's more fun
than an Eddie Murphy bed.

02:14.818 --> 02:16.353

You said we were going

He's never willing

I was once a lot like you:

unmotivated, dangerously obese,
always relying on cutaways...

03:43.807 --> 03:45.475

No, Peter. No more cutaways.

03:46.910 --> 03:48.545
-Stay in the present.
-Okay.

03:48.578 --> 03:50.880
Okay. Now tell me what you feel.

03:50.914 --> 03:52.882
Uh, a partial erection.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.784
I don't get touched very often.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.253
You know you deserve
a better life, right, Peter?

03:57.287 --> 03:59.623
Yes. Getting hard
to breathe in here.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.658
I want to give you that life,
Peter.

04:01.691 --> 04:04.227
Time to seize
your personal power.

04:05.695 --> 04:07.631
Yeah, by getting away from you,
you weirdo.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.733
But first, here's that cutaway
I was gonna do

04:09.766 --> 04:11.000
before you made me skip it.

Peter, I've seen thousands

of them.

04:38.127 --> 04:41.097
I'm not going to let you
be my first failure.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.866

I don't want your help.

Wait, w-where is he?

05:25.842 --> 05:27.477
Why do you want to hang out
with him so badly?

05:27.511 --> 05:29.413
He's just, like, a cool guy.

05:29.446 --> 05:31.981
Hi, Stewie.
I'm putting sand on a cat poo.

05:32.015 --> 05:33.417
Cool!

05:33.450 --> 05:34.651
(sighs)

05:34.684 --> 05:36.352
I like you, Stewie.

05:36.386 --> 05:38.488
Can I come over for a playdate?

05:38.522 --> 05:40.323

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Brian, can Hudson come over
for a playdate?

05:45.729 --> 05:47.664
Sure, I guess so.

05:47.697 --> 05:49.699
Never heard you ask
for a playdate before.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.035
I know, but there's a first time
for everything.

05:52.068 --> 05:54.370
Like when I finally built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

05:54.404 --> 05:55.872

grilled cheese
cut to look like a dinosaur.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.764
Ugh. They never look

Well, I hope
you don't use your guns

09:12.268 --> 09:14.070

or do anything bad.

09:14.103 --> 09:15.204
'Cause if you do,

09:15.238 --> 09:16.873

-Uh-huh.
-Mine, too.

You know what?
I'm going to let her live.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.950

And it's all because
of our friendship, Hudson.

09:31.287 --> 09:33.657
-You really mean that?
-You bet I do.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.424
And I always tell it like it is,

09:35.458 --> 09:38.027
like when I used to write
tombstones.

09:41.097 --> 09:43.767
Complained a lot
is what she did.

09:48.204 --> 09:50.306
Stewie, what are you doing?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.808

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:07.691 --> 10:09.993
Stewie, slow down, slow down.
What happened?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.928
We went to the zoo.
We saw an ape.

10:11.961 --> 10:13.296
At first
we didn't think we'd see him

10:13.329 --> 10:15.031
'cause he was, like, hiding
back in his house.

10:15.064 --> 10:16.599
But then he came out.
We saw him!

10:16.632 --> 10:18.634
We saw the ape! He was big.

10:18.668 --> 10:20.136
And then-- and then-- and then--

10:20.169 --> 10:21.671
and then-- and then--
and then...

10:21.705 --> 10:23.439
Okay, I get it.
You had fun.

10:23.472 --> 10:26.509
Wait, you're not mad
I went without you, are you?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.377
No, no,
I-I was only going for you.

10:28.411 --> 10:31.447
And maybe to taunt the animals
that aren't able to leave.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.016
Which is all of them.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.617
Losers.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.119
All right, you have
to take us to lunch,

10:36.152 --> 10:38.487
but first we need
to take our nap.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.495
Here's your triple bacon burger
and your onion rings.

10:47.697 --> 10:48.965
Ah, crap.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.566
There's only nine pieces
of bacon.

10:50.599 --> 10:51.868
I paid for 12.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.302
But I don't wanna make a fuss.

10:53.336 --> 10:54.871
TONY (through car):
Peter, listen to yourself.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.974
No one will respect you until
you respect yourself first.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.575
Yeah. But I'm a nobody.

10:59.608 --> 11:01.010
You're not a nobody.

11:01.044 --> 11:03.713
Your meal is just as important
as anyone else.

11:03.747 --> 11:04.981
You're right.

11:05.014 --> 11:06.482
I'm not a nobody.

11:06.515 --> 11:07.717
TONY:
Say it again.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.085
I'm not a nobody!

11:09.118 --> 11:10.586
TONY:
That's the spirit, Peter.

11:10.619 --> 11:12.655
Now yell at that nobody
in the window.

11:12.688 --> 11:14.858
You there!
I demand more bacon.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.826
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here's more bacon.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.694
That's not more bacon...

11:18.728 --> 11:20.496
This is more bacon!

11:20.529 --> 11:22.498
Big day, Mr. Hogan.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.533
PAUL HOGAN:
Keep 'em comin', Jumpy!

11:26.535 --> 11:28.504
Here's your Star Wars
kids' meal.

11:28.537 --> 11:30.239
Which action figures did we get?

11:30.273 --> 11:31.941
I got Kylo Ren.

11:31.975 --> 11:34.577
I got the role during the
two months I was a hot actor,

11:34.610 --> 11:36.179
and now they're stuck with me.

11:36.212 --> 11:37.781
I got Forest Whitaker.

11:37.814 --> 11:40.583
Even as a toy you can't tell
where he's looking.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.052
I wish I had
the poorly-cast Kylo Ren.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.522
Here, Stewie.
You can have mine.

11:46.555 --> 11:48.524
You're giving me the better one?

11:48.557 --> 11:50.026
Why would you do that?

11:50.059 --> 11:51.527
Because you're my friend.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.562
Yes.

11:53.596 --> 11:55.765
You're my friend.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.534
You're my best friend.

11:58.567 --> 12:02.205
Let's choke on these...
together.

12:02.238 --> 12:04.240
(both gagging, choking)

12:06.810 --> 12:08.778
(both panting)

12:08.812 --> 12:10.579
That was fun.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.949
Let's switch.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.984
(both gagging, choking)

12:22.458 --> 12:24.227
Okay, guys.
Time to play "parachute."

12:24.260 --> 12:25.461
Grab an end

12:25.494 --> 12:27.563
and... lift.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.432
You know who loves "parachute"?

12:29.465 --> 12:30.834
My best friend, Hudson.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.735
-You know Hudson?
-I know Hudson, too.

12:32.768 --> 12:34.603
Are you going to his birthday
party tomorrow?

12:34.637 --> 12:35.939
I'm autistic.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.640
TEACHER:
And... lift.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.774
Birthday party?

12:38.808 --> 12:40.509
Yeah, it's at
the Family Fun Zone.

12:40.543 --> 12:41.845
Everyone was invited.

12:41.878 --> 12:44.213
I take up a great deal
of the teacher's time.

12:48.151 --> 12:50.086
-Where's the mail?
-On the table.

12:50.119 --> 12:51.821
What's going on? You seem upset.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.789
Oh, you're a...
you're a real student

12:53.823 --> 12:55.158
of the human condition,
aren't you?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.260
Yet, somehow,
it escapes your writing.

12:57.293 --> 12:59.262
Whoa! Why are you attacking me?

12:59.295 --> 13:00.663
(sighs)
I'm sorry, Brian.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.933
Everyone but me got an invite
to Hudson's birthday.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.268
I know why this happened.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.770
I called him
my best friend too quickly.

13:07.803 --> 13:09.338
Well, maybe it wasn't meant
to be.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.307
But, hey,
I'm-I'm still your friend.

13:12.842 --> 13:14.944
(as Clint Eastwood):
Yeah, but Hudson isn't.

13:14.978 --> 13:18.281
And that's just something
I have to live with.

14:04.961 --> 14:07.863
Shut up, Dad.
I'm watching Rick and Morty.

14:10.866 --> 14:15.171
So... does Mommy have friends
over sometimes at night?

14:15.204 --> 14:17.273
Sometimes.

14:17.306 --> 14:20.676
It must be weird having only
women come over to see Mommy.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.411
No, it's mostly men.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.113
Oh, it is.

14:24.147 --> 14:26.082
And you'd be comfortable
telling that to a judge?

14:33.489 --> 14:34.790
Good morning, family.

14:34.823 --> 14:37.260
My, who's this go-getter?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.695
Tony Robbins has helped me
become a better person.

14:39.728 --> 14:44.233
In fact, today, I'm gonna ask
for-- nay, demand-- a raise.

14:44.267 --> 14:46.035
"Nay"? Wow.

14:46.069 --> 14:48.137
This new you is
a bigger surprise

14:48.171 --> 14:49.738
than when they're making fun
of a celebrity

14:49.772 --> 14:51.274
on Saturday Night Live

14:51.307 --> 14:54.377
and the real-life celebrity
walks in behind them.

14:54.410 --> 14:57.613
(chuckles) Boy, they're really
socking it to this celebrity.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.716
(chuckles) Yeah, can you imagine
how mad the celebrity would be?

15:00.749 --> 15:02.918
I mean, wherever they are
at this particular moment,

15:02.952 --> 15:04.553
if they're watching,
they must be...

15:04.587 --> 15:05.721
(both gasp)

15:05.754 --> 15:06.889
Oh. (laughs)

15:06.922 --> 15:08.491
That's the actual celebrity

15:08.524 --> 15:09.993
walking up right behind 'em.

15:10.026 --> 15:11.995
He-he's catching 'em right
in the act.

15:12.028 --> 15:13.929
The-The SNL
actor doesn't know.

15:13.963 --> 15:15.398
Aw, he's gonna get in trouble.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.766
Look how mad the actual
celebrity is.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.468
He's folding his arms
and frowning.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.971
He tapped the SNL actor
on the shoulder.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.607
Look how surprised
the SNL actor is!

15:24.640 --> 15:26.575
Oh! He's completely busted!

15:26.609 --> 15:29.678
(screams and laughs)
How is this happening?!

15:29.712 --> 15:31.747
(both screaming)

15:31.780 --> 15:33.149
Oh, my God!

15:33.182 --> 15:35.784
I can't believe it!

15:35.818 --> 15:38.254
I was watching upstairs on Hulu!

15:38.287 --> 15:40.523
I saw it on my phone!

15:40.556 --> 15:42.658
My plane has Wi-Fi!

15:57.140 --> 15:58.307
Uh-oh.

15:59.808 --> 16:01.944
Stewie's dug up all his weapons.

16:01.977 --> 16:04.113
Oh, my God,
I've got to stop him.

16:04.147 --> 16:06.349
Go get 'em, tiger.

Hey.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.752
Shut your (bleep) mouth.

16:13.489 --> 16:15.124
Tony!
You're not gonna believe it.

16:15.158 --> 16:17.293
I demanded a raise
just like you told me to

16:17.326 --> 16:18.794
and they gave it to me.

16:18.827 --> 16:19.828
Tony?

16:19.862 --> 16:21.664

Geena Davis?

No, it's me, Peter.
Turn around.

16:26.169 --> 16:28.704
Tony? You're alive?

16:28.737 --> 16:30.173
But... how?

16:30.206 --> 16:32.007
I saw you get struck
by lightning.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.909
I was created by lightning,
Peter,

16:33.942 --> 16:35.578
in a lab, like Frankenstein.

16:35.611 --> 16:37.146
And what do you think
about fire?

16:37.180 --> 16:38.814
(roars)

16:38.847 --> 16:40.583
Anyway,
after the lightning strike,

16:40.616 --> 16:42.085
I climbed into your trunk

16:42.118 --> 16:43.919
and that's where I've been
living the past week.

16:43.952 --> 16:47.390
So, whenever I heard your voice,
that was just you in the trunk?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.657
That's right.

16:48.691 --> 16:50.193
Why would you go
to all that trouble?

16:50.226 --> 16:51.760
Peter, I told you,

16:51.794 --> 16:54.897
I wasn't going to let you be
my first failure.

16:54.930 --> 16:59.168
Wow, Tony, I don't know how
I can possibly thank you.

16:59.202 --> 17:00.836
You don't need to thank me,
Peter.

17:00.869 --> 17:03.005
I have hundreds of millions
of dollars.

17:03.038 --> 17:04.507
I keep it in my forehead.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.041
Well, I better be going.

17:06.075 --> 17:08.177
You have a Smart car?

Brian?

18:53.982 --> 18:55.184
What are you doing here?

I was invited?

I know. I'm sorry.

19:02.691 --> 19:05.461
I-I just... I saw how you were
connecting with Hudson

19:05.494 --> 19:08.197
and I-I was afraid
of losing our friendship.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.698
Friendship?

19:09.732 --> 19:11.967
Brian, you and I
have never been friends.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.802
We... We haven't?

19:13.836 --> 19:15.471
No. Friends are people

19:15.504 --> 19:17.072
who come in and out
of our lives.

19:17.105 --> 19:19.141
But you and I are family.

19:19.174 --> 19:20.543
That's forever.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.352
Sorry I caused all this trouble.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.919
I hope you can forgive me.

19:30.953 --> 19:33.922
Ah, that's okay, nothing could
ever come between us.

19:33.956 --> 19:36.725
I'm even going to
make a speech at your wedding.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.827
So Brian and I are down
in Mexico,

19:38.861 --> 19:41.196
and, as usual, he doesn't have
any cash on him.

19:41.230 --> 19:42.598
That's probably why your parents

19:42.631 --> 19:44.400
are paying for all this,
right, Evan?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.034
BRIAN:
Wait, hold on. Evan?

19:46.068 --> 19:47.270
Why am I gay in this?

19:47.303 --> 19:48.604
STEWIE:
Ah, it's the end of the show.

19:48.637 --> 19:50.138
We sometimes
do something silly here.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.681
So, now that you got me back
as a friend,

19:58.714 --> 20:01.517
what are all the great things
you have planned for us?

20:01.550 --> 20:04.453
Uh... we could...
go see a movie.

20:04.487 --> 20:07.189
Oh, a movie.
That's a great idea.

20:07.222 --> 20:08.691
You know what'll get me out
of this funk?

20:08.724 --> 20:10.359
The Equalizer 2.

20:10.393 --> 20:12.295
(chuckling) Okay.
All right, fine.

20:12.328 --> 20:13.462
I got-I got nothing.

20:13.496 --> 20:14.697
Exactly.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.064
And you were such
a jealous little bitch

20:16.098 --> 20:18.767
that you had to ruin the one
friendship I really cared about.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.936
You're just a big jerk
and I hate you,

20:20.969 --> 20:23.038
and there's nothing you can do
to make up for it.

20:23.071 --> 20:24.307
Fine.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.241
Maybe I'll just go out
and get some ice cream.

20:26.275 --> 20:27.643
Ice cream?

20:27.676 --> 20:28.877
I like ice cream.

20:28.911 --> 20:30.112
Yeah, I don't know.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.814
I think it's more of
a bigger kid thing.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.216
No, no, no! No. I've had
ice cream, like, six times.

20:34.249 --> 20:35.851
All right, come on, let's go.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.755
You know, Brian,
I'm starting to think

20:39.788 --> 20:42.725
we're going to get through
our... Rocky Road.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.760
(both chuckle)

20:46.462 --> 20:47.896
(forced laugh)

20:47.930 --> 20:49.565
We had a lot of laughs tonight,

20:49.598 --> 20:51.434
but let's remember
the important thing:

20:51.467 --> 20:53.569
you can't put a price
on your happiness,

20:53.602 --> 20:56.104
which is why I have:
it's $6,000.

20:56.138 --> 20:59.041
See you in Fort Myers, probably.
