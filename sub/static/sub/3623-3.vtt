00:04.237 --> 00:06.839
[Bell rings]

00:06.841 --> 00:09.508
Good-bye, history,
hello freedom!

00:09.510 --> 00:11.844
The bell does not
dismiss this class.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.612
I dismiss this class.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.714
But Mr. Barkin, the rest
of the class is...

00:15.716 --> 00:19.118
Stoppable! Are you
questioning my authority?

00:19.120 --> 00:19.818
Oh, no.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.254
Oh, yes. And we know
what that means.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.522
Extra homework?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.122
Affirmative.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.222
I'll expect it on my desk
tomorrow morning by 7 A.M.

00:26.224 --> 00:30.796
But they don't even unlock
the school doors until 7:30!

00:30.798 --> 00:31.930
[Whimpers]

00:31.932 --> 00:33.265
Extra homework.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.534
Extra homework.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.069
Ugh!

00:37.071 --> 00:38.137
What's the matter, K?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.705
Too rough out there for you?

00:39.707 --> 00:40.605
Maybe, Bonnie,

00:40.607 --> 00:42.305
if you caught me like
you were supposed to.

00:42.307 --> 00:45.611
Was I? I thought you liked flying
and falling all over the place.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.313
What exactly is
your problem with me?

00:48.315 --> 00:50.315
Oh, it's always about you,
isn't it, Kim?

00:50.317 --> 00:52.918
Well, I am the one
who hit the gym floor.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.288
Hard. Because my spotter
had to take a call.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.023
It was an emergency.

00:58.025 --> 00:58.957
Brick?

00:58.959 --> 00:59.757
Uh, yeah.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.393
He wanted to know
if I wanted to go to dinner.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.628
Or a movie.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.428
Or both.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.297
He's so cute
when he can't think!

01:05.299 --> 01:06.331
Toodles, Kim.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.033
What makes someone like that?

01:08.035 --> 01:09.001
Like what?

01:09.003 --> 01:10.602
Like Bonnie.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.402
[Beeping]

01:11.404 --> 01:12.971
Kim! We've got
a hot tip.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.173
Drakken?
Dementor.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.674
Well, that's a change of pace.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.576
He's on the move,
maybe headed to...

01:17.578 --> 01:19.578
A top-secret
research facility?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.578
Been there.
Saved that.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.347
At least we can
get out of here before...

01:22.349 --> 01:23.282

100%, Kim. And it looks
like you were right!

Ugh. Isn't it always?
Later, Kim.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. Magnifico.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.335
Think nothing of it,
miss possible.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.737
It's the least we can do.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.839
After all,
you saved our circus.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.639
It's no big.

02:54.641 --> 02:55.839
When you twisted your ankle,

02:55.941 --> 02:57.442
somebody had to fill
in on the high wire.

[Honks horn]

02:58.144 --> 03:00.312
Oh, yes. Ahem.
Lord Laffington is right.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.447

a delightful addition

03:02.449 --> 03:05.250

light on number 8.

Over here, K.P.

What are you doing in here?

03:15.427 --> 03:18.197
I couldn't concentrate with Lord
Laffington honking in my ear.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.465
I gotta get this homework done
for Barkin's class.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.100
You still think Barkin's
out to get you?

03:22.102 --> 03:25.470
I know, Kim. I looked at him
funny once in the ninth grade,

03:25.472 --> 03:26.972
and he's dogged me ever since.

03:26.974 --> 03:27.873
A funny look?

03:27.875 --> 03:28.773
That's all it took.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.475
Some people are just
born to battle, K.P.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.011
Like you and Bonnie.
It's the circle of life.

Stop! Don't you see
the security beams?

Am I the only one who
notices these things?

04:30.103 --> 04:34.406
Unh! Hope you don't mind us
dropping in, Professor Dementor.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.807
Us? What?

04:35.809 --> 04:38.010
Unh! Ow!

04:38.012 --> 04:39.444
Go ahead.

Fine. Just start
with her.

[Grunting]

05:34.935 --> 05:36.234
Any idea what Dementor stole?

05:36.236 --> 05:39.404
No. I'm hitting hard
resistance collecting data.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.472
And his location?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.272
Could be anywhere.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.241
It's like Dementor
vanished when he...

05:43.243 --> 05:45.410
Got away.
I know, I know.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.379
I got a rope wedgie, ok?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.179
What's that?

fighting orb thingy

I did?
You didn't?

05:52.186 --> 05:53.418
No.
Then what is it?

05:53.420 --> 05:56.288
I'll analyze it
and get back to you.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.390
Ok, um, until then,
I'll keep it safe.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.624
Be careful.
Just don't...

05:59.626 --> 06:01.560
Drop it? Come on, Kim!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.061

06:07.934 --> 06:09.368
But look, you know,
no harm done.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.370
We're not shrinking,
changing colors,

06:11.372 --> 06:13.972
or turning into
armadillos. Ha ha.

I guess you're right.

Sorry, Mr. Barkin.

Ah! Hey!

06:33.360 --> 06:35.394
Explanation. Now!

06:35.396 --> 06:37.396
Did you lean in
something sticky?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.497
I never lean.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.797
Ok, well, could it have been...

06:39.799 --> 06:42.034
[Gasps] That mysterious
glowing ball!

06:42.136 --> 06:43.001
That weird smoke!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.369
What?
I have to warn Kim.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.570
To the gym!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.439
[Mr. Barkin grunting]
Watch it!

06:47.441 --> 06:50.308
Kim! Whatever you do,
don't...

06:50.310 --> 06:51.243
Touch anybody?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.443
Thanks for the loser update.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.580
I knew you were trouble ever
since the funny look incident.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.382
Yes! I knew I was right!

06:57.384 --> 06:58.382
[Beeping] Go, Wade.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.452
I finished analyzing the
contents of that orb.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.555
It's a super-strong
molecular adhesive,

07:03.557 --> 07:04.489
so be careful.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.992
We are so past careful.

07:06.994 --> 07:07.692
Whoa.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.792
Ok, Mr. computer guy,

07:08.794 --> 07:10.362
maybe you can offer up
a solution here.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.130
Well, there's gotta be
a solvent.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.465
Check. Get on it.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.265
Right.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.301
Hey, I found out what
was stolen from the lab.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.204
A prototype. High yield
kinetic modulator.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.440
From what I can tell,
it's very dangerous.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.241
Especially in Dementor's hands.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.578
Whoa. Don't care about
this demental guy.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.378
Both: Dementor.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.348
Whatever. Unlike you,
I have a life,

07:29.450 --> 07:30.415
and things to do.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.117
Things to do! Oh, man!

07:32.119 --> 07:34.486
Math test! I'm missing
my math test!

07:34.488 --> 07:37.289
No running in the halls.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.259
[Groans] No?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.561
No. Carry the one,
and then...

07:42.563 --> 07:43.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:43.564 --> 07:44.996
I am not cheating for you.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.199
Hey! Not for me,
with me.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.468
I don't think so.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.268
Whew.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.004
Man, that was
touch-and-go for a while,

07:52.206 --> 07:53.638
but I pulled it out in the end.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.438
What? What?

07:54.440 --> 07:58.210
You are planning to pursue a
non-math-intensive field, correct?

07:58.412 --> 07:59.310
[Whimpers]

07:59.312 --> 08:02.447
Interesting. There's a high
density molecular process

08:02.549 --> 08:03.582
involved in this bonding agent.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.051
It's a sticky situation.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.419
Ha! Good one!

08:07.421 --> 08:08.286
Thanks.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.086
So not helping.

08:09.088 --> 08:10.989
Sorry, dear.
We deal in science.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.390
Not mad science.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.190
[Both sigh]

08:13.292 --> 08:15.427
Oh, yeah! At the end
of a hard week,

08:15.429 --> 08:18.463
nothing like Bueno Nacho
to soothe the soul.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.665
It can shave years
off your life.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.465
Huh?

08:21.467 --> 08:23.969
Hey, I'm trying to
soothe my soul here.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.438
I'll show you how to unwind.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.309
This is how
you relax? Unh!

08:31.311 --> 08:32.777
Ready to run?

08:35.081 --> 08:36.615
Feels good.
Feels right, doesn't it?

08:36.617 --> 08:38.750
[Crack] I can taste my spleen.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.653
Everything she owns
is so last week.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.555
And her room?
Two words... ugh!

08:43.557 --> 08:45.624
Bonnie, I can hear
what you're saying.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.360
Hello? Private convo,
miss nosy.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.761
Hello, stuck together.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.463
Now she's giving me attitude.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.797
I'm giving <i>you...</i>

08:52.799 --> 08:53.597
Girls, girls.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.333
Don't make me separate you two.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.736
[Chuckles] Separate you two.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.638
The old man's still got it.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.241
And her father is so funny.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.677
I'm sorry we don't have
the guest room made up.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.646
But I hope you'll be
comfortable out here.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.482
Affirmatory and that,
Mrs. Stoppable.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.384
Good night.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.351
[Snoring]
Ron: Um...

09:13.353 --> 09:14.553
Can I get a little
blanket, here?

09:14.555 --> 09:18.156
No can do, Stoppable.
Mr. fuzzy will get cold.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.558
[Whimpering]

09:19.560 --> 09:22.427
[Snoring and whimpering]

09:22.429 --> 09:25.397
[Snoring]

09:27.433 --> 09:29.501
Brick's picking us up
at 8:00?

09:29.503 --> 09:31.303
Not us. Me.
[Beeping]

09:31.305 --> 09:33.838
Wade, tell me I about to
lose 105 pounds.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.207
Sorry, not yet. But I
thought you should know...

09:36.209 --> 09:39.411
I've been registering power
surges all over the globe.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.279
Dementor.
[Engine revs]

09:41.281 --> 09:42.347
He's here!

09:42.349 --> 09:44.449
Whoa!

09:44.451 --> 09:46.217
[Revs engine]

09:46.219 --> 09:47.485
You've gotta be kidding.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.420
Whoa!

09:48.422 --> 09:50.822
[Screams]

09:53.092 --> 09:54.459
He needs to get a side car.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.362
You need to run faster
and learn to duck.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.530
So who do you think did it?

09:58.532 --> 10:00.498
Oh, please! It's the guy
in the clown mask

10:00.500 --> 10:02.701
with the hook for a hand
who keeps saying "I did it."

10:02.703 --> 10:06.304
Whoa! I never would
have figured that out.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.739
She's good.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.739
[Gasps] [Growls]

10:08.741 --> 10:11.776
I had a nice time, brick.
All things considered.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.511
Yeah, pizza was good.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.748
So, um, am I supposed to
kiss her good night, too?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.483
Both: No!

10:18.485 --> 10:23.154
Ah, Saturday. A day for self
improvement and growth.

10:23.156 --> 10:23.954
Right, Stoppable?

10:24.056 --> 10:25.490
Well, um, I was actually
kind of thinking about

10:25.492 --> 10:26.858
hanging at the mall
for a while,

10:26.860 --> 10:28.560
you know, maybe catch a movie.

10:28.562 --> 10:29.794
Perfect. The gym it is.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.496
Aah!

10:36.202 --> 10:37.202
[Spits]

10:37.204 --> 10:38.002
[Gasps]

10:38.004 --> 10:39.402
You could have planned
this a little better.

10:39.404 --> 10:40.505
Don't be a water weenie,
Stoppable.

10:40.507 --> 10:43.241
Only 50 more laps.
Big breath. Let's go!

10:43.243 --> 10:44.376
[Ron inhales deeply]

10:44.378 --> 10:46.578
[Squeaking]

10:46.779 --> 10:49.314
You're gonna wear
that color in public?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.249
Well, maybe.
I don't know, why?

10:51.251 --> 10:54.586
I suppose it helps draw attention
away from the rest of your face.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.287
Well, I am...
[Beeping]

10:56.289 --> 10:57.387
I don't have an exact fix,

10:57.389 --> 11:00.892
but Dementor's location is
somewhere in central Europe.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.692
On my way.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.292
Whoa! I can't leave
for Europe right now.

11:03.294 --> 11:05.797
I've got a psychic reading
with a kelp wrap at 3:00.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.800
You know, Dementor probably
has the solvent

11:08.802 --> 11:10.402
that will get us unstuck.

11:10.404 --> 11:11.102
Yeah, and?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.871
And I've had enough
togetherness.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.541
Fine. But I am not missing
my reading and wrap.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.876
All right, this is
an important meeting,

11:17.878 --> 11:19.411
so don't embarrass me,
Stoppable.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.913
They're a tough bunch.
You're gonna have to keep up.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.883
Just no more swimming
and no more rugby.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.719
Troops, attention!

11:27.721 --> 11:29.788
[Laughing]

11:29.790 --> 11:31.723
You're a pixie den mother!

11:31.725 --> 11:34.359
Brigadier pixie.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.795
I traced Dementor
to the bavarian alps.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.196
I'll leave in an hour.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.931
In an hour?
I see...

11:39.933 --> 11:42.634
Less dry skin and more romance

11:42.636 --> 11:43.735
in your future.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.471
Don't ask.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.439
Ahem.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.474
[Makes flute sound]

11:53.345 --> 11:55.513
Girls: Ooh!

11:55.515 --> 11:56.481
Pixies, identify.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.383
Knotted bull squirrel, sir!

11:58.385 --> 11:59.584
Correct. Now you try.

11:59.586 --> 12:03.021
[All making flute sounds]

12:03.023 --> 12:04.255
Good job, troopers.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.890
Stoppable.
Uh, you know,

12:05.892 --> 12:06.991
I don't do squirrel.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.460
What's the pixie motto, Cindy?

12:08.462 --> 12:09.894
We stick together!

12:09.896 --> 12:10.594
Ironic.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.363
Now give it your
best shot, Stoppable.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.232
Well, ok. Ahem.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.435
[Shrieking]

12:17.437 --> 12:21.306
[All laughing]

12:21.308 --> 12:23.241
Bonnie, we don't
have time for this.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.510
I'm not gonna be seen
in countries like France

12:25.512 --> 12:27.812
or China or Cincinnati
in sweats.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.515
Since when is
Cincinnati a country?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.484
It's a city, like France.

12:32.486 --> 12:33.685
This is Connie and Loni.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.520
They're my older sisters.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.788
Way older.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.689
Him, I'm...

12:37.691 --> 12:38.656

Kim.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.893
Whatever. I got
all the brains.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.827
I got all the looks.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.562
And Bonnie got the rest.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.598
[Both laughing]

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
What?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.034
Um, nothing.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.738
Fellow pixies, the day
we have long awaited

12:53.740 --> 12:55.540
has finally arrived.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.576

[All cheering]

12:59.679 --> 13:01.846

I love pixie muffins!

13:01.848 --> 13:03.915
We must leave
no doorbell unrung,

13:03.917 --> 13:08.586
no supermarket unblocked,
no muffin unsold.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.286
We must...

13:09.288 --> 13:10.889
Sell every flavor,
from pumpkin spice

13:10.991 --> 13:13.525
to the misunderstood
bacon and chive.

Glad to see
you're on board, Stoppable.

13:21.535 --> 13:24.068
Like you said,
pixies stick together.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.804
Right. And recon
has informed me

13:25.806 --> 13:30.608
that a rival pixie troop has
infiltrated our muffin territory.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.476
All: No!

13:31.478 --> 13:33.711
[Gasps] We must defend

13:33.713 --> 13:35.313
what is rightfully ours!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.949

every other troop!

We must get more muffins,

13:41.621 --> 13:43.555
'cause we ate all
of ours over here.

[Belches]

13:49.829 --> 13:51.796
This is not helping
my new nails.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.499
Why didn't we use a
rocket pack or something?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.869
A rocket pack wouldn't be able
to life the extra weight.

13:57.871 --> 14:02.040
Ok, what's wrong now?

14:04.476 --> 14:05.977

What? Oh, uh, sorry.

the way it came out.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.448

14:11.450 --> 14:14.352
Why didn't we just take
that road over there?

14:14.354 --> 14:17.722
Um, we wanted to be sneaky?

have totally cut me off.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.162
We're close.

We'd be closer
if we took the road.

of being sneaky.

What was ours is ours again.

of their muffin territory.

Mr. Barkin:
Retaliatory strike!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.097
Ron, I'm worried about Kim.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.632
She's somewhere
in the bavarian alps.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.800
Ron: Bavaria?
Ah...

18:22.802 --> 18:25.837
The land of sauerbraten
and schnitzel.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.972
She had just found
Dementor's lair

18:27.974 --> 18:28.906
when I lost her signal.

Come on! We gotta
save Kim!

18:30.310 --> 18:33.311
And Bonnie, too, I guess.

[Gasps]

18:33.913 --> 18:36.147
Good thinking, Stoppable.

18:36.149 --> 18:39.283
Bavaria is completely
untapped territory.

Aw, but those were
for travel snacks.

the show much better

operating collector.

Think of it as
a front-row seat.

When the machine is activated,

18:52.866 --> 18:55.933
you will both be
vaporized! Poof!

18:55.935 --> 18:57.401
Why are you going to
such elaborate measures?

18:57.403 --> 19:00.004
Isn't there an easier
way to do this?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.104
Both: It's how it's done.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.742
Um, think it was a good idea
bringing the pixies along?

19:04.744 --> 19:05.910
You know the drill, Stoppable.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.379
Pixies stick together.
I know. But still.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.347
Aah! Unh.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.147
Unh!
Unh!

19:10.149 --> 19:12.717
Besides, we need
one more field trip

19:12.719 --> 19:14.118
to earn our adventure badge.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.887
Awesome! We're
getting badges!

19:15.889 --> 19:17.088
Not this trip, tenderfoot.

Uh-oh.
What?

20:00.033 --> 20:03.134
turns out to be
a mutant weiner dog call.

Boo-yah!

The least of our worries.
If I can get the communicator,

20:15.248 --> 20:16.480
I might be able to

Bonnie, I'm sorry
I got you into this.

It's ok. It was
almost like fun...

You know, Bonnie,

I feel like I sort of
understand you better now.

Ok.

Why did you have to
break down the door?

It wasn't locked,
