00:07.382 --> 00:09.592
[theme music plays]

00:22.939 --> 00:24.858
I was the young guy.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.110
The new kid.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.448
But, uh, this past year, I feel like I...

00:32.991 --> 00:34.451
truly became a friend.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.246
Like I...
I found a whole new group of friends,

00:41.416 --> 00:43.835
and we went through a lot together.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.008
And we'll get through this.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.891
[Clay]  Anxiety is a motherfucker.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.059
Excuse my language.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.480
Just everything that's out there,
waiting to happen to you.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.191
You couldn't identify any of the others?

01:06.274 --> 01:07.567
[Foundry] Mm. Just one.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.862
Diego Torres. Football player, wrestler.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.990
As far as I can tell,
there's no connection to Clay Jensen.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.162
[Diaz] Well, clearly,
there's some sort of connection,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.998
and I bet it's Montgomery de la Cruz.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.001
Well, that's a closed case, right?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.003
[Clay]  What you know is coming...

01:27.504 --> 01:28.546
For now.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.174
...and what you don't.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.760
I did a terrible thing.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.930
I know I hurt people.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.975
I'd give anything to take it back.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.394
I just--

01:43.478 --> 01:47.107
Bringing a deadly weapon on campus
is usually an automatic expulsion.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.650
It wasn't even a real knife.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.153
Could it really have stabbed someone?
Did you really bring it into the dance?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.405
Look, I mean,
they both admitted it was a prank.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.616
Clay's already taken responsibility,
so...

01:57.492 --> 01:59.994
Because it's possible it was used
in self-defense,

02:00.411 --> 02:04.374
and because you both have already served
your two-week suspensions,

02:04.457 --> 02:06.292
the only outstanding question is,

02:06.376 --> 02:09.212
will you be allowed to attend
the senior camping trip?

02:11.798 --> 02:16.052
If there aren't any further statements,
the board should just deliberate and vote.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.303
OK?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.975
[Clay]  When your fate
is in someone else's hands...

02:25.979 --> 02:26.938
[door opens]

02:27.021 --> 02:28.606
...or no one's.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.028
If you make me miss
the senior camping trip,

02:34.112 --> 02:36.072
I'll keep fucking with you
until the end of time.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.324
This is on  you,  asshole.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.869
I took the blame for the knife,
what more can I do?

02:40.952 --> 02:43.329
-You brought the knife onto the field.
-You left it for me.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.831
So you say.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.835
Too bad there are no security cameras
in the boys' showers, huh?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.003
They have them on the field.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.839
Yeah, where you were acting
like a crazy motherfucker the whole night

02:52.922 --> 02:54.299
and crying over a dummy.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.219
-Innocent people don't act like that.
-You set me up.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.931
You've been fucking with me
this whole time: breaking into my house,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.057
the graffiti.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.642
Cops had you cold.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.479
Suddenly they let you go,
and it's all on Monty,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.815
and he's not around to defend himself?

03:11.774 --> 03:12.901
How'd that work, hmm?

03:13.401 --> 03:14.569
[door opens]

03:15.236 --> 03:16.738
This is over. OK?

03:17.488 --> 03:20.366
-[Diego] We'll see.
-[Clay]  What you see coming...

03:26.080 --> 03:27.457
Well, I was outvoted.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.709
...and what you don't.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.294
-[sighs]
-[bell rings]

03:31.377 --> 03:32.879
Stop.   My God.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.673
[Jess giggles] Oh, my God.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.926
-[Diego] See you tomorrow.
-[Jess] See ya.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.135
Yeah.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.306
Jessica, what the fuck?

03:43.389 --> 03:47.393
Look, Clay, I'm sorry, but you know
you shouldn't be going on this trip.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
If they break you in front of everyone--

03:49.646 --> 03:50.980
I'm not breakable.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.066
Dude, we're all breakable,

03:53.149 --> 03:54.567
and you're the worst.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.527
[Foundry] Everything OK?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.739
-[Jess] All good here.
-Yeah, all good.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.367
Outstanding.
Then I suggest you get to class.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.290
[Clay]  And when people are watching you,
seeing you,

04:09.374 --> 04:12.627
and you can see that they see it,
it only makes it worse.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.922
Every year on the fucking senior trip,

04:16.339 --> 04:19.384
the team singles out some poor kid
and destroys him.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.094
Destroys him how?

04:21.177 --> 04:24.138
They use this stupid fucking legend
about Burnham Woods.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.807
No one fucking believes it,

04:25.890 --> 04:28.142
but they pull all this shit
to freak kids out.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.436
One year, this kid pissed his pants.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.191
[Clay]  I mean, 
I see people talking about me,

04:36.359 --> 04:37.819
and I feel lost.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.445
Alone.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.201
-What are you guys whispering about?
-Oh. Nothing. Um, how did it go?

04:47.495 --> 04:49.122
[Clay]  Going back to school...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.958
after a two-week suspension...

04:52.834 --> 04:53.668
was like...

04:53.751 --> 04:55.253
[voices distort]

04:55.336 --> 04:57.046
...like coming back from war.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.589
[tense music plays]

04:58.673 --> 04:59.924
[distorted voice echo]

05:02.677 --> 05:05.471
-Hey.
- Does everyone think I'm, like, crazy now?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.765
Everyone thinks you're fine.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.892
I'm gonna talk to Alex, all right?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.770
Things have been getting way more serious
since you've been gone.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.148
He's spending every minute with Winston.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.275
Right.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.196
[Clay]  Even my friends looked at me
like I might go at any minute,

05:22.613 --> 05:23.906
lose it completely...

05:24.824 --> 05:26.034
And maybe they're right.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.080
Is that what happened at the dance?
You lost it completely?

05:31.914 --> 05:32.832
No.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.294
I don't know.   No.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.629
No, that's...
that was just the football team.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.381
Just a prank.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.343
You think the guys might do worse
on the camping trip?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.136
Should you speak to a chaperone?

05:45.845 --> 05:49.182
That would be the absolute worst thing
I could do.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.145
You know, I sometimes think you adults

05:54.812 --> 05:57.148
overestimate how helpful adults can be.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.443
Other adults.
I'm not saying you're not helpful, I'm--

06:00.526 --> 06:01.944
Well, that's good to hear.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.821
What makes me helpful?

06:05.114 --> 06:08.117
I can tell you what I'm afraid of.

06:08.826 --> 06:09.786
Such as?

06:11.829 --> 06:12.663
Camping.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.166
Outdoors.   Fire.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.293
Potential bears.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.586
It's freaking me out.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.758
But then the thought of not going
and everyone knowing that I'm not there

06:24.675 --> 06:26.052
is almost worse.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.845
Because it would be embarrassing?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.138
Yeah.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.891
Do you feel more anxious

06:32.558 --> 06:34.977
when you're with others
or when you're alone?

06:35.686 --> 06:36.562
Both?

06:37.438 --> 06:38.689
Alone?   I don't know.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.858
And how do you respond to your anxiety?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.611
What do you mean, how do I respond?

06:43.694 --> 06:46.072
I feel anxious.
I try to stop feeling anxious.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.448
Does that work?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.450
It makes it worse.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.955
Have you ever tried
going into your anxiety?

06:54.372 --> 06:58.376
-What do you mean?
- Instead of running from it, look into it.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.794
Find out what it's about.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.170
Interrogate it.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.338
That's... I...

07:04.966 --> 07:07.510
I wouldn't even begin to know
how to do that.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.513
How about this:
where do you feel your anxiety

07:11.222 --> 07:12.265
in your body?

07:13.641 --> 07:14.767
Point it out for me.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.102
[sighs, clicks tongue]

07:16.519 --> 07:17.437
Here.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.274
Here.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.235
Here.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.781
And here, weirdly.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.033
You feel it inside of you.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.538
So maybe it's a part of you.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.206
Just consider that,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.750
and the next time
you feel the panic come on,

07:40.334 --> 07:43.129
look it in the eye
and ask it what it's doing.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.047
Look it in the eye?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.218
That sounds terrifying.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.512
I have a hunch you've faced worse.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.347
Haven't you?

07:54.640 --> 07:58.227
I get a sense
that you've been through a great deal,

07:58.561 --> 07:59.812
and you've survived.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.898
[suspenseful music plays]

08:03.774 --> 08:07.028
So what is it exactly
that you're afraid of?

08:08.821 --> 08:12.116
[Clay]  I'm afraid
of not being strong enough.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.952
Out with Diego again?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.705
[Jess huffs] Maybe.   So?

08:18.956 --> 08:20.958
Are you really sure that's a good idea?

08:21.042 --> 08:23.461
[sighs] Sorry, are you here to shame me?

08:23.961 --> 08:25.671
Diego thinks Monty was framed.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.176
Or maybe he just likes me.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.056
Do you really want to tell me who I should
or shouldn't be sleeping with?

08:35.139 --> 08:36.557
Like... [chuckles]

08:36.641 --> 08:38.017
...who's not a good idea?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.978
Are we actually gonna talk about that?

08:41.062 --> 08:41.896
Jess.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.774
Diego destroyed Clay.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.442
Bryce raped me.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.110
And you slept with him.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.198
-Jess--
-I know what I'm doing with Diego.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.409
-[sighs] Are you sure?
-Better than you do.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.120
Diego messed with Clay,
and you let that happen.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.375
You two were supposed to handle shit,
and it is not at all handled.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.169
There's something else. Um...

09:05.962 --> 09:07.505
My mum had a fall at work today.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.257
Oh, shit.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.591
She's in hospital,

09:10.675 --> 09:13.594
and she needs me to come home
and help out for a bit,

09:14.387 --> 09:17.014
which means
I'm gonna have to miss the camping trip.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.016
Of course.   Go.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.687
I'll take care of Diego and Clay.

09:24.272 --> 09:28.401
Is there anything I need to know
about... anything?

09:30.695 --> 09:31.529
No.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.072
Nothing new.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.033
OK.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.661
[cell phone pings, vibrates]

09:40.538 --> 09:41.581
[Jess sighs]

09:44.083 --> 09:45.668
You've got to be shitting me.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.465
[Jess] "Guys, I know every one of you
is a good person.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.968
You've kept my secrets,
and I've kept yours...

09:56.596 --> 09:58.681
but we've all done terrible things.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.474
I can't live with that anymore.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.810
I can't keep looking over my shoulder..."

-Yes.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.553
am so...

sure.

[girl giggles]

10:42.350 --> 10:45.728
[Jess]  "Wouldn't it be better for everyone
if we just told the truth?"

10:47.438 --> 10:50.316
"We hurt people,
and it's time to come clean.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.526
If we don't all confess to what we did,

10:52.610 --> 10:56.197
I'm going to tell everyone the truth
at the senior share campfire."

10:57.657 --> 10:59.033
I mean, this is insane.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.621
[Justin sighs]

11:05.164 --> 11:07.291
I didn't write this,
you have to believe me.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
I do believe you.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.254
It just... It came from your account.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.674
Yeah, someone must have hacked me.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.635
Why would I write this?
It's fucking Diego and those guys.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.929
Why would they come after you again?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.098
I think it's 'cause I picked that fight.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.642
Why did you pick that fight?

11:28.270 --> 11:29.438
All right, Clay, uh...

11:30.856 --> 11:32.066
let's just not go.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.859
We can just hang here.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.988
Camping sucks anyways.
It's intensely uncomfortable.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.701
You don't think I can handle it.
You think I might, like, break.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.369
No, I didn't say that. What's--

11:43.452 --> 11:44.870
Like I'm actually crazy.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.165
Clay.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.877
Clay, what happened on the football field?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.132
Why won't you tell me?
Because you don't trust me?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.550
Because nothing happened!

11:57.633 --> 11:58.592
[sighs]

12:00.720 --> 12:02.346
Let's just stay home, OK?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.764
[door opens]

12:03.848 --> 12:05.391
Hey!

12:06.934 --> 12:08.436
Look what I bought.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.812
[Mrs. Jensen giggles]

12:12.022 --> 12:14.150
Everything you need...

12:15.151 --> 12:16.318
to go camping.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.154
Mom, I'm not wearing that.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.782
I know, I bought it for myself.
I'm going with you guys.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
I'm sorry, what's happening?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.829
Mom, no.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.374
Just no. You don't even know how to camp.
Only Dad does.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.502
I know, and unfortunately,
he's at a Dickens conference, so...

12:34.044 --> 12:35.629
You won't even know I'm there!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.715
Besides,
look at all this great stuff I got us.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.759
That REI guy really saw you coming.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.344
Oh, check it out! Solar lanterns.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.098
Oh, of course,
you need sunlight to charge them.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.601
I'm gonna put them outside in the morning.
Fun!

12:49.059 --> 12:51.353
Hey, get your sleep. OK?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.942
I guess we're going camping.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.153
[Clay]  The legend of Burnham Woods.

12:59.236 --> 13:03.616
Some kids were partying in,
like, ancient times, like the '80s.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.951
One of them was drunk
and fell into a ravine,

13:06.035 --> 13:07.286
cracked his head open.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.872
His friends left him for dead,
but he wasn't dead,

13:09.955 --> 13:11.874
and he came back
to get his revenge on them

13:11.957 --> 13:13.501
one by one with an ax.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.252
He says he was hacked.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.379
You can't really believe that.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.007
We have to do something.
Take control of this.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.052
But is that maybe exactly what
whoever wrote the email wants,

13:23.135 --> 13:26.013
for us to do something
that makes us look crazy or guilty?

13:26.430 --> 13:28.349
Someone wants a confession.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.018
They're sure as hell
not getting it from me.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.021
We have to make sure
they don't get it from anyone else.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.773
[Clay]  He buried them in the woods,

13:35.856 --> 13:38.234
and marked their graves
with cairns and crosses,

13:38.317 --> 13:41.362
and now his spirit roams the woods
with that ax,

13:41.445 --> 13:44.907
terrorizing teenagers
and making them pay for their sins.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.660
Whoo!

13:48.410 --> 13:51.205
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I love that you're here,

13:51.288 --> 13:54.416
mainly because I don't have to
share my tent with some dickhead,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.877
but... you're not a senior.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.672
Well, I'm team captain.They think
I can keep things under control.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.966
That makes sense.
Well, good luck with that.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.050
-[chuckles]
-Uh,

14:03.133 --> 14:05.845
I'm more interested
in it being out of control, myself.

14:05.928 --> 14:10.683
Well, I made granola camp cookies, so...

14:11.308 --> 14:13.477
Fucking yes.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.728
-[giggles]
-Charlie.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.813
[scoffs]

14:15.896 --> 14:17.231
[Clay]  Dumb story, right?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.984
But here's the thing: when you're afraid,

14:20.067 --> 14:23.571
and you can't just say
what you're afraid of or you don't know,

14:24.446 --> 14:26.490
then one story is as good as another.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.242
[tense music plays]

14:29.118 --> 14:30.744
[indistinct chattering]

14:33.163 --> 14:36.625
[Clay]  So your mind takes the story
and tells it to you over and over

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
until it might as well be real.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.257
-So you got into my email now too?
-I'm sorry, what?

14:43.340 --> 14:45.509
The email you sent from my account.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.387
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Bullshit!

14:48.470 --> 14:50.055
Look, I told you, I'm not...

14:50.139 --> 14:52.099
[sighs]
...I'm not doing this anymore.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.309
-OK?
-[chuckles]

14:53.976 --> 14:55.102
[Diego] Yeah, I know.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.187
No, Jess was right.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.982
You really shouldn't have come.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.192
Are you threatening me?

15:02.693 --> 15:03.611
Maybe.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.863
Are you feeling threatened?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.656
[suspenseful music plays]

15:14.622 --> 15:17.875
[Clay]  And the way anxiety works,
it builds on itself.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.170
It just grows all on its own
until it's out of control

15:21.253 --> 15:23.756
and you try anything you can to stop it.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.760
Dude, that's... I am not dating Winston.
I mean, that's crazy.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.931
Alex, Ani saw you in the hallway
at the dance.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.560
That's not anyone else's fucking business.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.686
Actually, it is.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.358
Winston can alibi Monty
for the night of Bryce's murder.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.442
They were together.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.737
Winston told Ani right after Monty died.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.364
So Winston and Monty?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.324
But Monty wasn't gay.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.450
Was he?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.911
People surprise you.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.543
Does he know what I did?

16:02.544 --> 16:05.297
No, but it feels like
he knows something's up.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.133
Ani thinks
Winston might have sent the email.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.930
Has he asked any questions
about Monty or Bryce or me?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.349
[stammering] I don't know. Maybe.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.269
You and Ani knew about him all this time?
Why are you just telling me?

16:19.353 --> 16:20.521
We just wanted to be sure.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.148
-No one else knows yet.
-What am I supposed to do?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.698
It's... I... I mean, we're just, like...

16:31.615 --> 16:33.242
I don't even know what we are.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.703
-I don't know.
-[Clay] Look, whatever it is,

16:36.954 --> 16:37.955
it's not safe.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.127
[Clay]  But whatever you try,
you can't stop it.

16:43.627 --> 16:44.712
[Tyler] I believe Clay.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.923
I mean, it's easy
to hack into someone's account

16:48.007 --> 16:50.092
and schedule an email to go out whenever.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.388
I don't know, that all sounds
like really complicated computer shit.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.305
[Tyler] Yeah.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.390
[Tony] I mean,

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
who would know how to do that?

17:00.227 --> 17:01.228
Would you?

17:02.896 --> 17:05.649
Are you... Wait, do you think it was me?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.070
How could you even think that?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.865
Why'd you leave with Standall
the night of the dance?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.284
What?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.494
-I didn't.
-C'mon, Tyler, I saw you.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.291
[wood clattering]

17:25.002 --> 17:26.128
Being at the dance...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.423
just triggered some bad memories for me,

17:29.506 --> 17:34.261
and I wanted to talk to you
or Clay or Alex about it,

17:34.344 --> 17:37.473
but you were all busy.
I didn't want you to start worrying again.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.519
So, I mean, Standall knows the story,
so I just called him,

17:42.603 --> 17:43.771
and he drove me home.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.732
You were with me all night.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
-You seemed fine.
-How would you know?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.028
Hey, guys.

17:52.446 --> 17:55.699
-You OK, you need any help with anything?
-We're good, thank you.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.118
I'm gonna go get some more wood.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.414
[Clay]  Your friends begin
to seem like strangers.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.211
You don't recognize them,
and they don't recognize you.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.925
Do you have a condom?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.551
I gotta go help the guys.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.970
Help the guys with what?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.181
Just help them.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.558
-[sighs]
-Does it matter?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.644
[groans] Well...

18:24.561 --> 18:27.981
it does when you're turning down sex
to do it, so...

18:30.526 --> 18:32.111
Is it about messing with Clay?

18:32.903 --> 18:33.946
Why do you care?

18:34.571 --> 18:36.448
You said he was crazy.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.200
That's why I care.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.703
You push him, he snaps,
you get suspended again.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.750
I get bored and find another stupid,
hot guy. [chuckles]

18:47.543 --> 18:49.002
This really about Clay?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.840
Or is this about Justin?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.428
Don't worry about Justin.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.638
[boy 1] Wait up, Luke.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.557
[Luke] We drink first, then we go.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.310
So, will you drop the subject
if I tell you I won't fuck with Clay?

19:07.271 --> 19:10.774
-[boy 2] ...beat the shit out of him!
-[boy 3] Shut up, Jessica's here.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.485
-[Jess chuckles]
-[boy 1] Boys, let's get it!

19:13.569 --> 19:15.904
Also, um, I'm not stupid.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.197
[Jess] Really?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.449
'Cause you're letting me walk away.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.035
[boy 4] There you go.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.454
[suspenseful music plays]

19:25.789 --> 19:26.623
[Winston] Alex.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.917
Hey, Alex. Wait up!

19:30.878 --> 19:32.004
What's going on?

19:33.005 --> 19:36.175
-Why'd you pack your stuff?
-I'm gonna bunk with my dad tonight.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.218
-What? Why?
-I can't do this anymore.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.511
Camping?

19:39.887 --> 19:40.888
No, us.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.557
Why?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.643
-Did I do something wrong?
-No, I just...

19:47.060 --> 19:49.646
-I'm not sure I'm into guys.
-I don't believe that.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.273
You don't know how I feel.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.984
Tell me what I did wrong.
Please, I promise I'll fix it.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
You can't fix it.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.739
Don't I deserve an explanation?

19:58.822 --> 19:59.823
[Alex] I gotta go.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.827
[Clay]  So maybe the danger's real
or maybe it isn't,

20:04.369 --> 20:05.495
but the fear is.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.834
OK, then, the question for senior share.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.379
"Looking back on your time at Liberty,
do you have any regrets?"

20:18.467 --> 20:21.887
You know,
let's pick something a little happier.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.222
Uh...

20:23.305 --> 20:26.183
"Who do you trust most in your life

20:26.725 --> 20:27.809
and why?"

20:31.146 --> 20:32.439
[boy coughs]

20:35.776 --> 20:36.818
[Diego] I'll go.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.243
I, um...

20:45.619 --> 20:48.747
I always trust my boys to have my back.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.708
And...

20:51.792 --> 20:53.794
I... I trusted Monty,

20:55.003 --> 20:55.879
always.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.467
He was the one that got me to play.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.096
Freshman year,
I, um, remember telling him,

21:04.179 --> 21:06.556
"Dominicans don't play football."
[chuckles]

21:07.724 --> 21:09.851
But he wouldn't take that.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.062
He taught me pride,

21:13.230 --> 21:16.066
he taught me what it was to trust someone,

21:17.901 --> 21:18.777
and...

21:19.945 --> 21:20.946
and I miss him.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.200
[Clay]  And, yeah,

21:25.617 --> 21:28.245
I'm afraid the football players
are gonna fuck with me,

21:29.288 --> 21:32.374
and I don't know what I'll do if they do.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.337
Everyone gets a sheet of clues
and a GPS device,

21:37.421 --> 21:39.923
which I hope you know how to operate.

21:40.007 --> 21:44.636
We've collected all of your phones,
and if anyone has a second phone,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.471
then you're disqualified.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.682
And also your parents are too rich.

21:48.765 --> 21:49.766
[snickering]

21:49.850 --> 21:54.813
Hidden around this camp are canvas bags
with treasure inside,

21:54.896 --> 21:55.897
like this one.

21:57.607 --> 22:01.194
So all these clues have been designed
to keep you in safe places,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.196
but this is the wild.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.283
We're out here alone,
and we need to look out for each other.

22:06.366 --> 22:11.413
So stick with your partner, please.
And if you should encounter some wildlife,

22:11.496 --> 22:14.583
try to remain calm and back slowly away.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.752
Then come back to camp
and change your underwear.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.587
-[snickering]
-Yes, thank you, Diego.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.714
-All right, stay safe, have fun.
-[boy] Yeah, bro.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.674
-Come on up, guys.
-[boy] Get up!

22:23.383 --> 22:24.718
[eerie music plays]

22:30.432 --> 22:32.642
You sure you know how to use that?
Because I do.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.938
Look, I just think it's best
if we do this totally together.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.693
Are you seriously worried about me?

22:43.403 --> 22:45.447
You don't really think I wrote that email?

22:46.990 --> 22:48.617
-Justin!
-No! I don't.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.621
I think someone sent the email,
and they want a confession.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.123
-And you think it might be me.
-I don't!

22:57.084 --> 22:58.585
Clay, I... I don't.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.882
But I think someone wants shit
to go down on this trip.

23:06.176 --> 23:09.179
And, look, maybe you're not
in the best place to handle that.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.099
But you are,

23:12.182 --> 23:13.183
of course.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.312
I know how to use this, you don't.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.981
And what about you, Justin?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.902
Who has the best access to my computer?
Who knows my password?

23:24.361 --> 23:26.113
-Just you.

maybe this is your next thing.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.584
Maybe you're the one
who wants a confession. Huh?

23:42.838 --> 23:43.672
Justin!

No, Diego promised me
they wouldn't fuck with him.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.850
What?   You just believe
whatever Diego tells you?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.351
You heard how much he misses Monty.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.604
I know, that's why
I've got him on the hook.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.105
You know? To check him.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.065
What if he's got  you  on the hook?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.150
He doesn't.

24:45.233 --> 24:48.361
Even if he did, I'm not dumb enough
to let him get close to me.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.696
I know what I'm doing.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.493
Is this why you wanted to partner with me?
To criticize me?

24:54.576 --> 24:55.535
No, I'm not...

24:56.203 --> 24:57.078
No.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.707
Then why aren't you
with your new best friend? The new kid.

you guys really liked each other,

-No, he's actually not a really good guy.

get us in trouble, or...

33:19.580 --> 33:20.623

I'm just not meant to be happy, or like--

you can just let go of everything

36:59.967 --> 37:01.010
Who told you that?

37:02.136 --> 37:04.222
You were just pretending to be my friend.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.017
Just using me like you used Alex.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.853
Is... is that what Alex said?

37:10.937 --> 37:11.938
Is it true?

37:14.690 --> 37:15.900
It's complicated.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.785
I knew Monty a little bit.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.539
Why didn't you tell me?

37:31.999 --> 37:33.876
It's because of what he did to you.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.801
And you were the first person
to ever be nice to me at Liberty,

37:44.428 --> 37:46.138
and I hoped we could be friends.

37:47.848 --> 37:48.724
Why?

37:50.559 --> 37:51.769
Why did you hope that?

37:52.311 --> 37:53.688
Because I needed a friend.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.990
[tense music plays]

38:04.991 --> 38:06.659
Aren't you gonna finish the hunt?

38:11.747 --> 38:13.165
[indistinct muttering]

38:13.249 --> 38:16.252
I'm telling you, we went back for him,
he wasn't in the hole.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.878
Does Beecher have him?

38:18.421 --> 38:21.382
We don't know where the fuck
Beecher even is. He's missing.

38:23.009 --> 38:23.968
Beecher!

38:24.635 --> 38:25.511
Diego!

38:26.762 --> 38:29.849
[Clay]  What if someone started
fucking with the football team?

38:29.932 --> 38:30.766
Diego?

38:32.435 --> 38:33.394
Beecher?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.897
[haunting voice] Revenge.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.484
[whispering] Revenge.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.569
Who is that?

38:41.944 --> 38:44.113
-Who is that?
-[branches snapping]

38:45.614 --> 38:46.699
[jock] What the fuck?

38:47.283 --> 38:48.284
It's blood!

38:49.201 --> 38:50.453
[Clay]  That'd be cool.

38:50.536 --> 38:51.620
[lock clanks open]

38:54.999 --> 38:57.043
Shit. They're not here.

38:57.460 --> 39:01.005
If we hang out, they'll show.
Or do we go back and report Clay missing?

39:01.088 --> 39:04.258
I don't know.
It's just attention we don't need.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.635
We also don't need Clay lost.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.723
-[door slams]
-What the fuck?

39:10.806 --> 39:11.891
What the fuck?

39:12.433 --> 39:13.434
Where's Clay?

39:13.517 --> 39:14.560
We don't know.

39:14.643 --> 39:15.895
Fuck you, you don't know.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.314
What are you guys doing? What's the game?

39:18.397 --> 39:20.566
We just... We fucked with the clues, OK?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.902
We sent people places
to freak them out, that's it.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.570
That's all we did.

39:24.653 --> 39:27.239
And there's shit happening that is not us.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.867
There's something out there.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.702
[chuckling] Diego, man, give it up.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.455
You're a somewhat decent DB,
but you are a shitty liar.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.998
[muffled screaming]

39:36.624 --> 39:38.209
Come on. Jesus, enough!

39:38.292 --> 39:39.335
It's not us!

39:39.668 --> 39:41.253
[muffled yelling]

39:42.505 --> 39:43.714
Oh, shit!

39:43.798 --> 39:45.633
[muffled moaning]

39:47.301 --> 39:50.262
-[Luke] Get up. Come on.
-I told you it's not us.

-[Luke] Come on. Get up!
-[groaning]

39:54.183 --> 39:57.144
-Come on. You're OK, bro.
-[muffled gasping]

39:57.228 --> 39:59.647
Can we... get him some pants?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.483
[eerie music plays]

40:06.028 --> 40:07.279
[fluttering]

40:07.780 --> 40:09.115
[voice whispers] Confess.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.491
Fucking Diego.

40:11.283 --> 40:12.368
I know it's you.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.162
You're not gonna scare me, you asshole.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.705
[Bryce]  Hey, Jess.

40:17.623 --> 40:18.624
Hey, Jess.

40:19.959 --> 40:20.960
Hey, Jess.

40:21.627 --> 40:22.503
What the fuck?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.172
[Bryce]  I raped Hannah Baker.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.800
I raped seven or eight other girls.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.678
-Who the fuck is that?
-[Bryce]  ...other girls.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.222
Who is that?

40:33.305 --> 40:34.765
Seven or eight other girls.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.933
Fuck!

40:36.308 --> 40:38.436
[Bryce] Shit, that looks like it hurt.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.439
You gotta be careful
running around in here.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.815
Fuck! [gasps]

40:44.191 --> 40:46.944
Why are you still afraid of me? I'm dead.

40:47.695 --> 40:48.863
I'm not afraid of you.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.115
You sure about that?

40:51.657 --> 40:53.993
It should feel better.
You should feel better.

40:54.869 --> 40:55.870
You killed me,

40:55.953 --> 40:57.121
so...

40:58.372 --> 41:00.416
everything's OK now, right?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.127
You should sleep better at night.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.087
I sleep great.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.548
-Really?
-[gasps]

41:08.841 --> 41:10.342
Even when you lie there...

41:11.844 --> 41:13.929
feeling my breath on your neck?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.475
You deserved to die.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.394
[chuckles]

[screaming echoes]

41:39.914 --> 41:41.540
[indistinct chattering]

41:43.083 --> 41:44.043
Hey, buddy.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.962
-You OK?
-Yeah, I'm just cold.

41:47.796 --> 41:48.756
Is your hair wet?

41:48.839 --> 41:49.757
Yeah.

41:50.257 --> 41:53.219
Yeah, I, uh, almost drowned in the lake.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.096
-What? Jesus, Alex.
-Dad, it's OK. It's fine.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.307
Zach pulled me out.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.268
But, Dad, I...

42:02.728 --> 42:04.230
I felt like...

42:05.356 --> 42:06.941
I was being pulled down,

42:07.316 --> 42:10.402
like I couldn't breathe anymore.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.280
And I couldn't even scream, and...

42:14.990 --> 42:17.243
that must have been
what Bryce felt, right?

42:17.993 --> 42:19.787
And I let him die.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.790
-Oh, no. [shushes]
-Dad, I felt so alone.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.583
Like, I feel so alone.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.294
I can't keep carrying this around anymore.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.798
-I know it's a lot, buddy, I know.
-[sobs]

42:30.881 --> 42:33.842
I could say something
that won't get anyone else in trouble.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.177
You won't get in trouble.

42:35.261 --> 42:39.431
I could just say that it was me alone
and that I lied to everyone else.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.642
Wait a minute, buddy, listen to me.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.686
It's not just you here, OK?

42:43.769 --> 42:45.813
-No, I know.
-No, listen.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.108
I don't want to put
any more pressure on, all right?

42:49.608 --> 42:52.778
But every single one of us,
we want the best for you.

42:53.445 --> 42:57.658
Your friends, they lined up
because you deserve your life,

42:57.741 --> 42:59.785
and you do not want to throw that away.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.495
But, Dad, it's not right.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.665
The older I get, the less I think I know
what's right all the time

43:04.748 --> 43:07.293
or that it's even ours to judge.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.503
I know one thing:

43:09.587 --> 43:12.756
your friends put it all on the line
for you,

43:13.299 --> 43:16.635
and they're good, smart kids,
and I think they did the right thing.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.137
But how do I deserve that?

43:18.220 --> 43:20.014
Dad, how do I live up to that?

43:20.097 --> 43:21.098
Look at me.

43:21.390 --> 43:22.433
Believe this:

43:23.309 --> 43:24.476
I love you.

43:25.477 --> 43:27.479
OK? And I always will,

43:28.355 --> 43:30.608
and you don't have to do a damn thing
to earn that,

43:30.691 --> 43:34.111
but be exactly who you are
and live the best life you can.

43:34.194 --> 43:35.571
-OK?
-[sniffles]

43:35.654 --> 43:36.530
Buddy...

43:37.781 --> 43:38.991
it's OK.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.827
-[sobs]
-We're gonna get through this, OK?

43:41.910 --> 43:44.788
I swear we're gonna
get through this together. I promise.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.291
It's OK.

What the hell was that?

43:56.091 --> 43:57.051
[sighs]

43:57.801 --> 43:59.303
Stay here, OK?

43:59.386 --> 44:00.721
-Go.
-I'll be back.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.943
Look, whoever it is, whatever it is,
it came after us.

44:15.027 --> 44:17.488
They fucked up our tent
and stole our shit.

44:19.198 --> 44:22.159
-They attacked Beecher.
-Then where the fuck is Clay?

44:22.242 --> 44:24.495
Why do you care so much
about that little prick?

44:24.578 --> 44:27.247
-We don't know where he is.
-[Luke] Tellin' ya, it's the dead kid.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.542
-It's the woods.
-[jock] It's the ghost of Burnham Woods.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.211
Oh, come on, stupid!

44:32.294 --> 44:34.254
Can you honestly tell me you didn't see

44:34.338 --> 44:36.548
or hear anything fucked up
out there tonight?

44:41.887 --> 44:42.846
Jess?

44:49.395 --> 44:50.229
I...

44:51.021 --> 44:52.856
Jess, what happened?

44:53.065 --> 44:54.525
[metal clanging, rattling]

44:58.737 --> 44:59.697
All right.

45:00.155 --> 45:01.407
OK, we're scared.

45:01.490 --> 45:02.908
Enough, please.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.521
We could starve in here.

45:33.272 --> 45:34.189
Dude,

45:34.606 --> 45:36.608
you're not gonna starve
any time soon.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.945
Hey! I have very low body fat, Foley.

45:40.904 --> 45:42.239
This is muscle.

all kinds of fucked up.

[groans]

46:06.847 --> 46:08.015
[pants]

46:09.600 --> 46:10.684
We're out of here.

46:11.101 --> 46:14.021
-Let's go.
-Are you fucking kidding? Stop them!

46:14.104 --> 46:16.815
-We're all getting the fuck out of here.
-No.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.109
We gotta talk.

[cell beeps]

46:49.473 --> 46:51.183
[suspenseful music plays]

46:54.645 --> 46:56.271
What the fuck?

47:16.667 --> 47:17.751
[groans]

47:27.302 --> 47:30.264
[Charlie]  So, Winston... and Alex?

47:30.848 --> 47:33.809
And Alex is, like, heartbroken.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.020
And now we're fucked.

47:37.104 --> 47:38.856
Oh, I'm sorry, more fucked.

47:39.398 --> 47:42.192
-Does Winston know why Alex did it?
-[banging on door]

47:45.821 --> 47:47.197
[sighs]

47:52.911 --> 47:53.996
Oh, for fuck's sake.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.748
Can we leave the damn door open now?

47:57.457 --> 48:00.502
Diego pointed me this way,
so what the fuck is going on?

48:01.044 --> 48:02.671
Winston Williams can alibi Monty.

48:03.422 --> 48:04.715
-Seriously?
-[Zach] Yeah.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.008
[Tony] The Hillcrest kid?

48:06.091 --> 48:08.844
He knows Monty didn't kill Bryce.
He was with him that night.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.347
Oh, and on top of that,
Clay and Ani have known that for months.

48:12.681 --> 48:16.268
Um... I'm sure it was just to protect us.

48:16.351 --> 48:17.811
Big surprise. They failed.

48:18.437 --> 48:21.064
So, the email was Winston?

48:21.690 --> 48:24.985
-I mean, is he gonna talk tonight?
-We don't know that it was Winston.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.863
Other people might want it out.

48:27.946 --> 48:28.906
Like who?

48:30.282 --> 48:31.617
Like Tyler.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.828
Tony, what makes you say that?

48:36.496 --> 48:37.706
Guys, maybe it was Ani.

48:38.832 --> 48:39.833
Think about it.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.085
It's way easier for her
to hack Clay than Winston,

48:42.169 --> 48:43.670
and now she's not even here?

48:43.754 --> 48:47.049
Honestly, any one of us
could have written that email.

48:47.132 --> 48:50.135
-Including you.
-Yes, Zach, including me.

48:50.218 --> 48:53.388
So are we gonna fucking fall apart
about it, or trust each other?

48:53.472 --> 48:56.433
-What's it gonna be?
-Clay's lost. We need to find him.

48:56.516 --> 48:57.517
[Bill] Hey, kids.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.770
Everything OK?

49:01.104 --> 49:02.731
Shall we get back to camp?

49:05.233 --> 49:06.902
[indistinct chattering]

49:16.328 --> 49:18.205
[horn sounds]

49:26.922 --> 49:28.006
I won.

49:34.721 --> 49:36.014
Where'd you get all that?

49:39.267 --> 49:40.686
You left me for dead.

49:40.769 --> 49:43.438
Oh, no way, dude. We went back for you,
you weren't there.

49:43.522 --> 49:44.856
I was unconscious.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.067
No. You were gone.

49:47.484 --> 49:50.696
I don't know what you think you're up to,
but we know shit now.

49:53.865 --> 49:54.866
You.

49:55.617 --> 49:58.161
Was it you? Are you working with them now?

49:58.245 --> 50:00.872
I... Seriously, I don't know
what you're talking about.

50:00.956 --> 50:02.124
Clay.

50:02.457 --> 50:05.335
But what about you?
You knew Diego was gonna fuck with me.

50:05.419 --> 50:06.545
You said so.

50:06.628 --> 50:07.546
[Bill] Hey.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.090
Campfire's ready. Let's go.

50:20.726 --> 50:24.438
The traditional question
for the final campfire.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.023
Um...

50:26.481 --> 50:30.861
The traditional question:
"How has this weekend changed you,

50:30.944 --> 50:33.447
and what memory
will you take with you forever?"

50:33.947 --> 50:34.865
I'll start.

50:37.993 --> 50:38.869
[sighs]

50:40.746 --> 50:45.208
It's great to finally be a part
of the Liberty community,

50:46.084 --> 50:48.754
to see how folks really are.

50:51.131 --> 50:54.551
I didn't know before,
so... that's really great.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.053
Wonderful, Winston.

50:56.470 --> 50:59.431
Yeah...
Welcome to Liberty fucking High School.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.266
[Mrs. Jensen] Yeah.

51:01.349 --> 51:03.018
Welcome. OK. [chuckles awkwardly]

51:04.227 --> 51:05.228
Who's next?

51:06.938 --> 51:08.607
Clay Jensen, help me out here.

51:18.658 --> 51:19.659
[sighs]

51:23.580 --> 51:25.999
How has this weekend changed me?

51:29.044 --> 51:31.046
How has this weekend changed us?

51:34.674 --> 51:35.675
It hasn't.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.097
'Cause I know that my friends and I...

51:41.264 --> 51:43.100
we'll be friends for life.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.144
There will always be a...

51:47.229 --> 51:49.731
a bond between us...

51:52.109 --> 51:53.652
that we can never break...

51:55.028 --> 51:56.279
even if we wanted to.

52:00.909 --> 52:02.035
Can I go next?

52:03.453 --> 52:05.455
[Bill] Buddy. Hey, buddy.

52:15.590 --> 52:17.008
I just wanted to say...

52:19.386 --> 52:20.595
or to confess...

52:20.679 --> 52:22.139
[suspenseful music plays]

52:27.686 --> 52:29.729
...that I fucking hate camping.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.106
[kids laugh]

52:37.154 --> 52:39.614
-[shell shattering]
-[boy] Hey, all right! Whoo!

52:40.574 --> 52:41.616
[girl] Good job!

53:00.886 --> 53:01.887
Hey!

53:04.639 --> 53:05.724
-Hey.
-Hey.

53:05.807 --> 53:09.060
Zach said I could bunk with you guys,
but is there room?

53:09.144 --> 53:11.062
Yeah. Of course there's room.

53:11.646 --> 53:12.522
Thanks.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.316
Yeah.

53:14.816 --> 53:15.734
So, uh...

53:17.485 --> 53:19.487
I'm sorry about everything with Winston.

53:20.238 --> 53:21.239
That's not fair.

53:22.574 --> 53:26.953
Oh, well, I mean,
it wasn't anything, really.

53:28.788 --> 53:29.873
Seems like...

53:31.082 --> 53:32.125
maybe it was.

53:34.294 --> 53:35.295
What do you know?

53:37.380 --> 53:40.634
I know that... you're a good person,

53:41.343 --> 53:44.971
and I'm sorry if you feel like shit
or whatever.

53:46.681 --> 53:48.183
That's all I know.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.062
Oh. Um...

53:55.315 --> 53:56.191
Thanks.

53:58.526 --> 53:59.402
Uh...

54:00.153 --> 54:01.404
Granola camp cookie?

54:04.199 --> 54:06.076
So, uh... thank you.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.582
Justin, you forgot toilet paper.

54:15.418 --> 54:17.504
If I see him, I'll let him know.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.256
What do you want?

54:20.924 --> 54:23.677
So Alex breaks up with me for no reason,

54:23.760 --> 54:25.220
Tyler finds out I knew Monty

54:25.303 --> 54:27.973
and ends our friendship,
and tonight at the campfire,

54:28.056 --> 54:30.850
every one of your friends wants
to say something they don't say.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.852
[tense music plays]

54:33.770 --> 54:35.021
So which one of them...

54:35.939 --> 54:36.898
killed Bryce?

54:42.320 --> 54:44.948
[Clay]  Yeah. Anxiety, panic,

54:45.865 --> 54:48.034
it's not about what you know is coming.

54:48.827 --> 54:50.203
It's about what you don't.

54:57.919 --> 54:59.838
[unsettling music plays]

55:05.176 --> 55:09.681
[Ani reads text]

57:05.463 --> 57:07.465
[man]  Well done, Ed. Well done.
