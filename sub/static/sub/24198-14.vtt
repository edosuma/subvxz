00:16.820 --> 00:54.717
NOT ONLY DESCRIBES THE BAD BEHAVIOR OF
SAD, PATHETIC MEN BUT IS ALSO IS NICKNAME

01:01.050 --> 01:05.217
>>> WELCOME TO "THE JIM JEFFERIES
SHOW." I'M JIM JEFFERIES.

01:05.220 --> 01:08.079
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP COZYING UP
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AT YESTERDAY'S

01:08.080 --> 01:11.279
SUMMIT AND THE PROTESTS THAT
FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE GOES,

01:11.280 --> 01:14.449
AMERICA'S IMAGE IS TAKING A
BEATING ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.279
AND YET AMERICA DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM TO GIVE A .

01:17.280 --> 01:22.949
WHAT WE LACK IN DIPLOMACY, WE
MAKE UP FOR IN CONFIDENCE.

01:22.950 --> 01:29.719
THE U.S. IS BASICALLY THE AGGRO,
COKED-UP GUY IN THE BACK WITH

01:29.720 --> 01:35.149
AXE BODY SPRAY, SCREAMING ABOUT
BITCOIN.

01:35.150 --> 01:41.279
AMERICA'S ALWAYS HAD AN UNHEALTHY SENSE OF
SELF-WORTH. ONE THAT CROSSES PARTY LINES.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.819
>> THIS RIGHT NOW IS THE
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH.

01:43.820 --> 01:47.419
>> WE LIVE IN THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

01:47.420 --> 01:52.848
>> YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE TO
PROTECT THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH.

01:52.851 --> 01:56.017
>> THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.220
>> THIS COUNTRY IS THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

01:59.221 --> 02:02.119
>> THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY
IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.579
>> OH, CALM DOWN, MARCO.
THE HISTORY OF MANKIND!

02:06.580 --> 02:10.579
IT'S NOT EVEN THE GREATEST IN
THE HISTORY OF NOW.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.219
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO BORA BORA?

02:13.220 --> 02:14.719
YOU JUST SIT THERE ON THE BEACH

02:14.720 --> 02:16.919
UL DAY DRINKING COCKTAILS WHILE

02:16.920 --> 02:18.349
RESORT WORKERS RUB YOUR FEET.

02:18.350 --> 02:19.679
SURE IT'S NOT A GOOD COUNTRY FOR

02:19.680 --> 02:20.380
THEM, BUT I HAD A WONDERFUL

02:20.381 --> 02:24.279
TIME.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.379
I'D BE THERE PERMANENTLY IF THEY

02:26.380 --> 02:28.079
HAD BETTER COMEDY CLUBS.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.579
OR A COMEDY CLUB.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.249
BRAGGING ABOUT HOW IT'S THE

02:31.250 --> 02:32.649
BESTLESS HAS BEEN AMERICA'S

02:32.650 --> 02:32.980
THING.

02:32.980 --> 02:33.580
NO ONE LIKES THAT.

02:33.581 --> 02:36.249
BEING THE TOP GUY IS OBNOXIOUS.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.349
IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TELLING

02:37.350 --> 02:39.449
EVERYONE YOU'RE BETTER THAN

02:39.450 --> 02:40.320
EVERYONE, THEN NO ONE WANTS TO

02:40.321 --> 02:41.579
BE YOUR FRIEND.

02:41.580 --> 02:42.879
YOU GET STUCK HANGING OUT WITH

02:42.880 --> 02:43.650
THE HOME IS THERE SCHOOLED KID

02:43.651 --> 02:48.479
WITH THE WEIRD HAIRCUT.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.079
AMERICA IS SO CONCERNED WITH

02:50.080 --> 02:52.049
BEING NUMBER ONE WE TEND TO

02:52.050 --> 02:53.319
FORGET THAT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY

02:53.320 --> 02:54.379
NUMBER ONE.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.419
>> THE UNITED STATES WAS 29th IN

02:56.420 --> 02:57.949
THE MOST RECENT RANKINGS OF

02:57.950 --> 02:59.149
COUNTRIES BY EDUCATION.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.379
>> THE UNITED STATES IS THE

03:01.380 --> 03:02.619
WORLD'S FATTEST DEVELOPED

03:02.620 --> 03:02.980
NATION.

03:02.981 --> 03:04.219
>> WE SPEND MORE MONEY ON HEALTH

03:04.220 --> 03:05.249
CARE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN

03:05.250 --> 03:05.950
THE WORLD.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.079
MOST OF US AREN'T LIVING ANY

03:07.080 --> 03:08.779
BETTER OR ANY LONGER BECAUSE OF

03:08.780 --> 03:09.080
IT.

03:09.081 --> 03:11.319
IN FACT, OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

03:11.320 --> 03:12.150
RANKS 37th IN TERMS OF OVERALL

03:12.151 --> 03:14.749
EFFICIENCY.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.879
>> SO YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE

03:16.880 --> 03:19.279
FATTEST, ALSO THE 29th DUMBEST,

03:19.280 --> 03:22.019
AND THE 37th HEALTH CARIEST.

03:22.020 --> 03:22.950
TRY PUTTING THAT ON A

03:22.951 --> 03:25.079
STATUE.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.249
AND WHEN YOU'RE IN CHARGE,

03:27.250 --> 03:28.419
PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO CLEAN UP

03:28.420 --> 03:29.579
THEIR MESSES.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.149
THE U.S. IS ALWAYS INTERVENING

03:31.150 --> 03:32.879
IN ONE COUNTRY OR ANOTHER.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.949
YOU DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF

03:34.950 --> 03:35.380
OBLIGATION.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.019
IT'S LIKE, WELL -- SHOULD I

03:37.020 --> 03:39.149
CLEAN UP SOME KID'S VOMIT AT MY

03:39.150 --> 03:40.419
SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

03:40.420 --> 03:43.619
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE WHO PUT THE

03:43.620 --> 03:45.449
DEPOSIT DOWN, I'M THE ONE WHO'S

03:45.450 --> 03:46.919
DRUNK, I SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO

03:46.920 --> 03:48.049
GETS TO THROW UP IN THE BOUNCY

03:48.050 --> 03:48.380
HOUSE!

03:48.380 --> 03:49.080
AND I DID!

03:49.081 --> 03:52.719
AND THAT THIS IS THE POINT!

03:52.720 --> 03:55.149
THE POINT IS IT WASN'T EVEN MY

03:55.150 --> 03:58.249
SON'S PARTY AND THE HOUSE WASN'T

03:58.250 --> 04:00.249
BOUNCY OR MY HOUSE.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.020
YES, YES, FINE, FINE.

04:01.021 --> 04:02.349
I WENT TO A STRANGER'S HOUSE AND

04:02.350 --> 04:03.320
I VOMITED IN IT.

04:03.321 --> 04:05.149
BUT I DID REMEMBER TO TAKE MY

04:05.150 --> 04:06.419
SHOES OFF.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.150
BECAUSE HOW ELSE I WOULD HAVE

04:07.151 --> 04:09.249
LOST MYSHOOS?

04:09.250 --> 04:14.249
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.679
WHEN YOU'RE NUMBER ONE, THE ONLY

04:15.680 --> 04:17.279
PLACE TO GO IS DOWN.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.719
IT CAN'T LAST.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.219
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERY

04:20.220 --> 04:21.719
OTHER SUPER POWER IN HISTORY.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.419
THE ROMAN EMPIRE FELL.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.919
THE BRITISH EMPIRE IS GONE.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.580
EVENTUALLY AMERICA WILL BE

04:26.581 --> 04:27.849
NOTHING BUT A TOURIST ATTRACTION

04:27.850 --> 04:28.979
LIKE THE PYRAMIDS OR WHATEVER

04:28.980 --> 04:33.019
THE  GREECE IS.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.179
I'M NOT SAYING DON'T BE PROUD TO

04:35.180 --> 04:36.249
BE AMERICAN.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.719
YOU SHOULD BE.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.979
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.419
IT'S GIVEN ME A GOOD LIFE.

04:40.420 --> 04:43.379
IT GAVE ME BASEBALL, LOBSTER

04:43.380 --> 04:44.050
ROLLS, PINBALL.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.249
IT'S AWESOME.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.619
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S NUMBER

04:46.620 --> 04:49.149
ONE OR NUMBER THREE OR WAY DOWN

04:49.150 --> 04:50.419
IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.679
IF YOU LIVE HERE AND YOU LOVE

04:54.680 --> 04:58.250
IT, THEN WHO GIVES A SHIT?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.379
MAYBE, MAYBE THE MOST PATRIOTIC

05:00.380 --> 05:01.350
THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST LOWER

05:01.351 --> 05:04.849
YOUR STANDARDS A BIT.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.619
THE WAY TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT IS

05:06.620 --> 05:08.579
TO ADMIT IT HAS FLAWS.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.079
I MEAN, ALL YOU PATRIOTS WHO

05:10.080 --> 05:11.449
SEEM TO LOVE THIS COUNTRY SO

05:11.450 --> 05:14.819

05:14.820 --> 05:16.619
IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO COME

05:16.620 --> 05:17.580
HERE, STOP TELLING THEM IT'S SO

05:17.581 --> 05:22.749
ING GOOD.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.719
WHY DON'T YOU FILM ALL YOUR

05:24.720 --> 05:28.149
MOVIES IN FLINT, MICHIGAN?

05:28.150 --> 05:30.819
AND IN THAT SPIRIT, I'M PLEASED

05:30.820 --> 05:31.580
TO INTRODUCE A NEW PATRIOTIC

05:31.581 --> 05:33.719
SONG.
